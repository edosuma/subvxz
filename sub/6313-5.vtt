♪ ♪

00:47.106 --> 00:49.568
The infected! They're closing in!

00:49.650 --> 00:51.236
Just kidding.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.029
You're safe at craft services.

00:53.112 --> 00:54.280
Colin Salmon.

00:54.364 --> 00:56.032
Hi, Dev. I'm a huge fan.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.369
Oh, good to see you're charging up
for the scene.

00:59.452 --> 01:00.912
Watch the dairy, though.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.497
It's not good for the voice.

01:02.581 --> 01:03.956
Uh-oh. Well, this is my second one.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.333
I'm excited for the scene today.

01:05.417 --> 01:06.501
As am I.

01:06.585 --> 01:08.336
But, of course,
today is also the anniversary

01:08.420 --> 01:10.630
of the disappearance of my cat,
Shakespeare,

01:10.713 --> 01:13.592
so there's a bit of a dark cloud
above us today.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.677
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

01:16.761 --> 01:19.805
Took him to the Swiss premiere
of Alien vs. Predator.

01:19.889 --> 01:22.601
We were enjoying a picnic by Lake Geneva
when an owl came,

01:22.683 --> 01:24.894
snatched Shakespeare with his talons.

01:24.977 --> 01:26.396
They flew off.

01:26.479 --> 01:28.648
We never saw each other again.

01:28.731 --> 01:30.525
The memory of that gruesome silhouette

01:30.609 --> 01:32.944
against an Alpine sunset

01:33.027 --> 01:34.987
is something I will never forget.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.701
All right, well, um...

01:40.785 --> 01:42.370
it was great to meet you.

01:42.454 --> 01:44.747
Um, I'm gonna eat
this cinnamon raisin bagel.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.707
I'll see you out there.

01:48.627 --> 01:49.961
Bye.

01:54.006 --> 01:56.008
So, guys, in this scene,
you're gonna be swarmed

01:56.092 --> 01:57.760
by a horde of the "sickened."

01:57.843 --> 01:59.345
You'll be wearing mech suits
to defend yourself.

01:59.429 --> 02:02.390
This is what they look like,
just in case you'd like to know.

02:02.474 --> 02:05.977
Um, but honestly,
most of this is gonna be done in post.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.270
It's kind of meaningless.

02:07.353 --> 02:08.938
We really don't even need you here.

02:09.021 --> 02:11.316
It's gonna be 99% CGI.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.777
But having said that,
let's go to your marks.

02:18.490 --> 02:19.491
Action!

02:19.574 --> 02:22.201
They're coming! Battle stations.

02:26.456 --> 02:27.873
There's too many of them.

02:27.957 --> 02:29.917
We're not gonna make it out of here.

02:30.001 --> 02:32.795
We're not. But you will.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.429
Cut.

02:42.722 --> 02:45.642
- That was great... I suppose.
- Cut. Ten minutes.

02:45.725 --> 02:47.435
I mean,
we won't know until after they CGI it,

02:47.519 --> 02:50.730
which could easily be a year.

02:50.813 --> 02:53.107
Um, just so I have a better sense
of the scene,

02:53.191 --> 02:56.068
how far away are the sickened
when they start approaching?

02:56.152 --> 02:58.154
It doesn't matter.

02:58.237 --> 02:59.322
Okay.

02:59.405 --> 03:01.949
Um, should I maybe say a line

03:02.033 --> 03:04.076
to motivate Colin's character
to leave the scene?

03:04.160 --> 03:07.747
Maybe just something like,
"Get out of here, you bastard!

03:07.872 --> 03:10.124
I'll hold them off! Tell my story!"

03:10.208 --> 03:11.376
That's great.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.502
That's great. I love that.

03:12.585 --> 03:13.503
I love that!

03:13.586 --> 03:14.837
Say whatever you want.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.465
This movie's not really about words.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.886
You've got a nice ear for dialogue.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.888
You're not a writer, by any chance,
are you?

03:23.971 --> 03:24.930
I've thought about screenwriting.

03:25.014 --> 03:27.308
So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of a writer.

03:27.392 --> 03:28.643
Well, I've got this idea for a movie,

03:28.727 --> 03:30.895
and I need somebody
to bounce ideas off of.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.398
You interested in coming by my trailer
to discuss it?

03:33.481 --> 03:35.316
Yeah, that'd be cool.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.569
Hey, why does your trailer
always smell like Cinnabons?

03:37.652 --> 03:39.237
That's because I bake Cinnabons.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.613
Really?

03:40.697 --> 03:41.906
Yeah. I have this small oven.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.449
It's fantastic.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.868
Come by my trailer tomorrow after lunch.

03:45.951 --> 03:48.747
And save some room for dessert.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.165
Because of the aforementioned Cinnabons.

03:51.249 --> 03:52.333
Okay.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.170
Man, why'd you drag me to a work party?

03:56.254 --> 03:58.256
'Cause you're my buddy. You're my friend.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.424
I want you to meet my coworkers.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.841
Oh, that's nice.

04:00.925 --> 04:02.468
Yeah, plus there's this girl here
I'm trying to get with,

04:02.552 --> 04:04.929
and if I showed up by myself,
that'd seem kind of lame.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.598
Uh-huh, I get that.

04:06.681 --> 04:07.890
And I asked a bunch of other people
to come,

04:07.973 --> 04:08.891
and they said no.

04:08.974 --> 04:09.975
Great, thanks.

04:10.059 --> 04:12.228
Ooh, champers. Yes, please.

04:12.311 --> 04:14.522
Thank you.

04:14.606 --> 04:17.149
So who is the lucky lady?

04:17.233 --> 04:18.693
Ah, there she go.

04:18.777 --> 04:20.779
That's Carla Meyers,
the new editor in chief.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.946
Cute, right?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.030
Which person?

04:23.114 --> 04:26.158
- Over there, the redbone chick.
- I don't see anybody with red bones.

04:26.242 --> 04:28.077
No, it just means she's light-skinned.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.495
It's a thing we say
in the black community.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.790
Oh, okay. So is Halle Berry a redbone?

04:31.831 --> 04:33.541
No, she's caramel.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.000
Look, here's the deal.

04:35.084 --> 04:36.502
She's straight,
but lately I've been getting

04:36.586 --> 04:38.129
some serious vibes from her.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.047
Ooh, vibes that she wants
to become a lesbian?

04:40.131 --> 04:43.092
No, vibes that she's curious
about an adventure with Denise.

04:43.175 --> 04:45.177
It's not about changing
a woman's sexuality, Dev.

04:45.261 --> 04:47.472
It's about one night in heaven.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.098
Look, I provide a service.

04:49.181 --> 04:50.349
What's the service?

04:50.433 --> 04:51.851
I can make a woman come more times
in 20 minutes

04:51.934 --> 04:53.185
than she has in the last six months.

04:53.269 --> 04:54.437
Oh, that's a really good service.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.855
All right, I'm in. I'm your wingman.

04:55.938 --> 04:57.982
Oh, shit, here she comes.

04:58.858 --> 04:59.859
Okay, just be cool.

04:59.942 --> 05:01.026
-Denise!
-Hey, Carla!

05:01.110 --> 05:02.821
-Hey!
-What's up?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.572
-I'm feeling the suit.
-Thank you.

05:04.656 --> 05:06.240
-I see you.
-Thank you so much.

05:06.324 --> 05:07.366
Who is this?

05:07.450 --> 05:08.367
I don't know this dude.

05:08.451 --> 05:09.786
Come on, let's get a drink.

05:16.835 --> 05:18.461
Um, excuse me.

05:18.544 --> 05:21.464
Hey, Vineet, it's Nina.
So good to see you.

05:21.547 --> 05:23.466
No, wrong Indian guy. I'm not Vineet.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.426
No, I know, I'm trying to get
rid of this weirdo over there.

05:25.510 --> 05:26.927
Just pretend you're talking to me
for a little bit.

05:27.011 --> 05:28.554
Oh, okay.

05:28.638 --> 05:30.264
Um, do I need to get in character
as Vineet,

05:30.348 --> 05:31.390
or can I be myself?

05:31.474 --> 05:33.893
No, you can-- You can be yourself.

05:33.976 --> 05:35.019
What if I want to be
a different Indian guy

05:35.102 --> 05:36.604
named Darwish who sells tractors?

05:36.688 --> 05:40.733
Okay, Darwish. How's the tractor business?

05:40.817 --> 05:42.234
Not good.

05:42.318 --> 05:44.904
So far, I've sold, mm, zero tractors.

05:44.987 --> 05:45.988
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

05:46.071 --> 05:47.866
Apparently there's no farmland
in Manhattan.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.618
It was-- It was a bad place
to set up shop.

05:50.702 --> 05:51.661
I'm Dev.

05:51.744 --> 05:52.871
Hey, I'm Nina Stanton, the food critic.

05:52.953 --> 05:53.954
What?

05:54.038 --> 05:57.249
Is that job as ridiculously awesome
and easy as it sounds?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.794
What's the best restaurant
you've been to recently?

05:59.878 --> 06:01.838
-Dirty French.
-What was your favorite dish?

06:01.921 --> 06:03.756
Uh, the chicken and crepes.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.676
Write that shit down.
You just wrote a review.

06:06.759 --> 06:08.010
Whoa.

06:08.093 --> 06:10.763
So when you make a reservation
at a restaurant,

06:10.847 --> 06:13.182
do you use an alias,
or do you use your real name?

06:13.265 --> 06:15.393
Well, people know my face at this point,
but yeah,

06:15.476 --> 06:17.562
whenever I make a res,
I have to use a fake name.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.397
Yeah, see,
this is why I'd be a good critic.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.857
I got so many aliases.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.859
Um, Bartholomew Cubbins,

06:22.942 --> 06:24.985
um, Yahweh Manchester,

06:25.069 --> 06:28.322
uh, and my favorite: just Essence.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.491
Ooh, see, you're a natural.

06:30.575 --> 06:32.368
If I ever need an apprentice,
I'll hit you up.

06:32.451 --> 06:34.370
Ooh, I'm down.

06:34.453 --> 06:36.247
You want to work under me?

06:36.330 --> 06:38.374
Whoa! Uh, that's pretty forward.

06:38.457 --> 06:40.167
Yes, sure.

06:43.212 --> 06:44.714
Mm.

06:44.797 --> 06:46.966
- Mmm.

06:47.049 --> 06:49.051
This is cool. You're cool.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.937
Has anyone ever told you
your makeout game's on fleek?

07:00.312 --> 07:02.189
Hey, um, do you want some weed?

07:02.273 --> 07:04.233
It's Purple Pineapple.

07:04.316 --> 07:06.151
I always smoke it before I have sex.

07:06.235 --> 07:09.321
Oh, shit! You're smoking it now!

07:09.405 --> 07:11.407
This is so cool.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.200
This is awesome.

07:13.284 --> 07:14.786
I like all of this.

07:18.915 --> 07:20.792
Nina, you are so cool.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.919
I just like your whole vibe.

07:24.837 --> 07:26.464
I don't even know--

07:29.258 --> 07:30.468
This is, like, the coolest thing

07:30.551 --> 07:31.886
that's ever happened to me.

07:31.970 --> 07:35.139
Can we just take a moment
to acknowledge how cool this is?

07:38.517 --> 07:39.602
What?

07:39.685 --> 07:42.229
You have, like, a sick-ass apartment too?

07:42.313 --> 07:43.564
This is crazy.

07:43.648 --> 07:46.066
Am I in a lucid dream right now?

07:46.150 --> 07:48.486
Am I, like, Vanilla Sky-ing myself
right now?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.279
Um, I'm gonna have some wine.
Do you want some wine?

07:50.362 --> 07:51.864
Yeah.

07:51.948 --> 07:53.950
Pfft! Look at this view!

07:54.033 --> 07:55.284
What, do you get, like, $1 million

07:55.367 --> 07:57.328
per restaurant review?

07:57.411 --> 07:59.497
Yeah, around that.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.667
The uni with wasabi snow,
while conceptually ambitious,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.669
was a disappointment.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.129
$1 million. Boom!

08:11.926 --> 08:13.427
♪ ♪

08:13.511 --> 08:14.929
Do you have a condom?

Uh, yeah, I do.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.894
Hey, wha--

Um, who's that guy that's at the beach?

Wh-wh-why does it look like

08:30.444 --> 08:34.281
you're getting married
to your brother in that photo?

08:34.365 --> 08:36.742
Okay, I'm married.

08:36.826 --> 08:38.828
-Aw, fuck! Come on!
-No.

08:38.911 --> 08:40.621
I knew this was too good to be true.

08:40.705 --> 08:41.998
Nina, no.

08:42.081 --> 08:44.291
I can't do this.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.168
No, it's fine. It's fine.

08:46.251 --> 08:47.837
No, no--

08:47.920 --> 08:49.630
I don't want your husband to murder me.

08:49.714 --> 08:51.465
Or I can't be, like,
some home wrecker person.

08:51.549 --> 08:53.509
No, no, no, you're not cheating.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.594
I mean, my marriage is my business.

08:55.678 --> 08:56.679
If I'm okay with this,

08:56.762 --> 08:58.263
you don't have to worry about it.

08:59.598 --> 09:01.851
I mean--

09:01.934 --> 09:05.897
I kind of want to do this, but--

09:05.980 --> 09:08.482
No, I can't. It's not a good idea.

09:12.028 --> 09:13.946
Do you care about the environment?

09:14.030 --> 09:17.199
My husband's company
is the number one polluter

09:17.282 --> 09:18.325
of the Hudson River.

09:18.409 --> 09:20.870
He is personally responsible for the death

09:20.953 --> 09:25.833
of thousands of local ducks.

09:25.917 --> 09:30.212
So if you care about our country's lakes
and rivers,

09:30.295 --> 09:32.673
we should totally have sex right now.

09:32.757 --> 09:36.218
Nina, you're very attractive.

09:36.301 --> 09:41.807
And I feel horrible
about those ducks, but...

09:41.933 --> 09:43.935
I think I should get the fuck out of here.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.394
All right.

09:45.477 --> 09:47.980
I'm putting my number in your phone.

09:48.064 --> 09:51.525
And when you change your mind, text me.

09:51.609 --> 09:54.653
Wow, you are so confident.

09:54.737 --> 09:57.239
Ooh, this is cool. This is the clean room.

09:57.322 --> 09:59.283
It's where we shot the scene
where the virus gets loose.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.367
Okay.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.578
Come on, Denise, get excited.
This is movie magic, boo.

10:02.661 --> 10:05.957
Fine, it's amazing,
and I'm extremely jealous of you.

10:07.416 --> 10:08.960
So what happened to you last night?

10:09.043 --> 10:10.044
You left before I did.

10:10.128 --> 10:11.253
Oh, yeah.

10:11.336 --> 10:12.922
A powerful redbone named Carla

10:13.005 --> 10:14.799
had a Denise experience last night.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.216
What? What does that mean?

10:16.300 --> 10:17.969
It means I went to town on the puss.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.804
She came, like, eight times in 30 minutes.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.263
Then she tried to do the same thing to me,

10:21.346 --> 10:22.681
but she didn't know what she was doing,

10:22.765 --> 10:24.142
so I only came, like, three times.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.476
It was adorable.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.186
Wait. She came eight times in 30 minutes?

10:27.269 --> 10:28.395
Like, how is that even possible?

10:28.479 --> 10:29.480
Look, I don't have time

10:29.563 --> 10:30.856
to explain lesbian shit to you, okay?

10:30.940 --> 10:31.983
We come more than anyone.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.276
Now, what happened to you last night?

10:34.359 --> 10:36.361
That food critic lady, Nina, took me home.

10:36.445 --> 10:37.947
Wait. Nina? She's married.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.031
Man, that's ratch.

10:39.115 --> 10:40.532
No, no, no, I'm not ratch.
I didn't do anything.

10:40.616 --> 10:41.533
I didn't know she was married.

10:41.617 --> 10:42.660
I left as soon as I found out.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.953
You know, that would've been fucked up.

10:44.036 --> 10:45.788
Uh, yeah, it is.

10:45.871 --> 10:48.499
Well, unless they have
one of those open marriages.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.960
You know, like, a Will and Jada situation.

10:51.043 --> 10:53.545
No, there's no arrangement
as far as I know.

10:53.629 --> 10:55.965
But she did seem, like,
super chill about it, you know?

10:56.048 --> 10:58.425
I mean, between us, like,
if it was purely a sexual thing,

10:58.509 --> 11:00.011
would that be so fucked up to do?

11:00.094 --> 11:02.596
Like, I'm not trying to start a family
with her or something.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.807
Well, you didn't see any photos
of any cute white kids

11:04.890 --> 11:06.225
sitting around, did you?

11:06.308 --> 11:07.977
Um, yeah.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.687
There was photos of Jonathan Taylor Thomas

11:09.770 --> 11:11.271
in his prime all over the place.

11:11.355 --> 11:12.564
No! No kids.

11:12.648 --> 11:13.983
Well, if that's the case,

11:14.066 --> 11:15.693
you're free to enter the puss.

11:15.776 --> 11:19.822
Mm, that's still a pretty risky puss
to enter, though.

11:19.905 --> 11:22.950
Like, I don't want to end up
like that dude in Unfaithful.

11:23.034 --> 11:24.326
You know, the husband,

11:24.409 --> 11:25.410
the Richard Gere of the situation,

11:25.494 --> 11:26.996
starts getting suspicious.

11:27.079 --> 11:29.123
He hires a photographer
to follow around his wife.

11:29.207 --> 11:30.875
Next thing you know, he's looking

11:30.958 --> 11:33.169
at a bunch of photos of me and her,
just like,

11:33.252 --> 11:35.004
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

11:35.087 --> 11:36.630
Then he's like, "All right, there he is.

11:36.714 --> 11:38.007
That's the guy!"

11:38.090 --> 11:39.508
Next thing you know,
he's beating me to death

11:39.591 --> 11:41.719
with a snow globe,
rolling my body up in a rug,

11:41.802 --> 11:43.387
and tossing me in a landfill.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.347
Unfaithful's dope.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.099
What, you've seen it?
I just told you the whole plot.

11:47.183 --> 11:48.184
Why didn't you stop me?

11:48.267 --> 11:49.393
I was feeling the recap.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.895
Oh, thanks.

11:56.984 --> 12:00.071
Here's the other thing: everyone cheats.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.572
Look at that guy.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.782
He's all old and beaten down.

12:03.866 --> 12:05.743
He's definitely cheated on his wife.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.494
Or had his wife cheat on him.

12:07.578 --> 12:09.538
More likely the second scenario.

12:09.621 --> 12:10.581
No way, you're totally wrong.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.916
That's my buddy Benjamin.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.668
He loves his wife. Hey, Benjamin!

12:14.752 --> 12:17.088
This is my buddy Denise.
She's visiting the set.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.923
Oh, hey.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.382
Have you ever cheated on your wife?

12:20.465 --> 12:21.800
Hey, take it easy, Denise.

12:21.884 --> 12:24.178
No, that's all right.
It's a great question.

12:24.262 --> 12:25.596
Definitely thought about it.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.431
Everyone's thought about it.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.391
Well...

12:29.474 --> 12:32.186
there was this one time, all right?

12:32.270 --> 12:35.397
It was this camera operator in Winnipeg.

12:35.480 --> 12:39.484
Small crew, spent a lot of time together
with her on set.

12:39.568 --> 12:42.529
Tension was definitely starting to build.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.698
Then one night, it was just the two of us

12:44.782 --> 12:46.450
at this shitty hotel bar.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.619
And there was karaoke involved.

12:48.702 --> 12:52.915
And I could tell she wanted me
to make a move.

12:52.998 --> 12:57.336
Right at the brink of me making
that decision...

12:57.419 --> 12:59.004
What happened?

12:59.088 --> 13:00.631
I went into my room.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.633
Jerked off. Fell asleep.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.717
The twist.

13:03.801 --> 13:05.803
That's what you got to do
in that scenario, right?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.430
It's 100% success rate in terms of you

13:08.513 --> 13:11.642
not wanting to have sex anymore
after you jerk off.

13:11.725 --> 13:12.851
But what about all your cuddles

13:12.935 --> 13:14.228
and your critically acclaimed dramas?

13:14.312 --> 13:15.562
I thought you had a rock solid thing.

13:15.646 --> 13:17.231
I mean, I love all that stuff, all right?

13:17.315 --> 13:20.734
But I've been-- I've been with my wife
for so long, you know?

13:20.818 --> 13:23.779
What's the longest
you've ever been with anybody?

13:23.862 --> 13:24.905
Two years.

13:24.989 --> 13:27.366
I've been with my wife 23 years.

13:27.449 --> 13:29.493
That's 20 more years, right?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.787
We've had sex a lot.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.915
Like, in the thousands.
Like, in the deep thousands.

13:34.999 --> 13:37.417
And we've had every version of sex, right?

13:37.501 --> 13:40.087
Time and time again,
different versions of sex.

13:40.171 --> 13:41.797
We've covered it all.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.966
We have no more ideas left.

13:44.049 --> 13:45.301
There you go.

13:45.384 --> 13:47.678
Why are you asking me
all this stuff anyway?

13:47.761 --> 13:49.596
Some married lady
wants to have sex with Dev.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.141
With Dev?

13:52.224 --> 13:53.684
That's great.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.227
You gonna do it?

13:55.311 --> 13:56.520
I don't know.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.646
Wouldn't you be upset if your wife

13:57.729 --> 13:59.023
cheated on you with some dude?

13:59.898 --> 14:02.609
I guess I'd be depressed a little bit,
yeah, you know.

14:02.693 --> 14:04.820
But what if you didn't know about it

14:04.903 --> 14:07.698
and she didn't have
any emotional attachment to the guy?

14:07.781 --> 14:10.993
Or girl, I mean,
if this was a Denise experience situation.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.620
So you're basically like a human dildo.

14:13.704 --> 14:16.165
It's not ideal,
but if I didn't know about it,

14:16.248 --> 14:17.499
it wouldn't kill me.

14:17.582 --> 14:18.583
Exactly.

14:18.667 --> 14:22.921
So it's like she went to the store
to buy a dildo,

14:23.005 --> 14:25.549
but in the package, it was my penis,

14:25.632 --> 14:28.177
and it was attached to my body.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.346
I'm just a human dildo.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.352
Come.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.689
Ah, Dev!

14:40.772 --> 14:42.441
Good to see you.

14:42.524 --> 14:45.027
Welcome to Shakespeare's trailer.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.820
Man, that must have been some cat.

14:47.696 --> 14:50.366
I'll run you through the elevator pitch
for the movie.

14:50.449 --> 14:51.533
Okay.

14:53.411 --> 14:58.040
So what is the one thing everyone has?

14:58.123 --> 14:59.291
I don't know.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.792
A car.

15:00.876 --> 15:05.423
So I do a movie where I am a car.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.967
So it's like Knight Rider
and you're doing the voice?

15:09.051 --> 15:12.221
Nope! I am the car.

15:12.304 --> 15:15.057
Batman has a Batmobile.
Thor has a Thor-mobile.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.725
I don't think he does.

15:16.808 --> 15:20.187
But in this movie, I don't have a car.

15:20.271 --> 15:22.022
I am the car.

15:23.274 --> 15:25.817
How do you get the power
to turn into a car?

15:26.985 --> 15:29.154
That's where you come in, writer.

15:30.448 --> 15:31.490
What do you think?

15:32.241 --> 15:33.700
Maybe you're sitting in your car

15:33.784 --> 15:35.619
and you get struck by lightning?

15:35.702 --> 15:36.870
That's good.

15:36.954 --> 15:38.789
That's very good.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.665
Just a thought.

15:40.749 --> 15:43.794
That might be the single greatest idea
I've ever heard.

15:43.877 --> 15:44.920
It is?

15:45.003 --> 15:46.255
Until now.

15:46.338 --> 15:48.840
Because, Dev, I'm inspired by you,

15:48.924 --> 15:50.426
and I am feeding off your energy.

15:50.509 --> 15:53.429
And I think I've come up with a title
for the film:

15:53.512 --> 15:55.222
CarPerson.

15:55.306 --> 15:56.598
No, wait. Wait.

15:59.310 --> 16:01.520
CarHuman.

16:01.603 --> 16:03.814
Why not just CarMan?

16:03.897 --> 16:06.942
"Colin Salmon is CarMan."

16:07.025 --> 16:09.778
Dev, you've done it again! It's brilliant.

16:09.861 --> 16:11.571
And we should celebrate with a Cinnabon,

16:11.655 --> 16:13.365
and I won't take no for an answer.

16:13.449 --> 16:14.574
Okay, I'll have one.

16:14.658 --> 16:16.494
Great!

16:16.576 --> 16:19.497
We just have to wait
for the glaze to thaw.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.665
Takes a few hours.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.625
Should be ready by nightfall.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.508
Do you have any specials?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.343
Yeah, the King Kong Banana Split.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.803
We take ice cream, bananas, and pineapple,

16:34.886 --> 16:37.348
and we add sesame caramel and Luxardo.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.765
It's amazing.

16:38.849 --> 16:40.392
Whoa, I'll take it.

16:40.476 --> 16:41.601
Okay.

16:41.685 --> 16:43.354
Clark, right.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.647
Hey, hold on one second, Greg.

16:45.730 --> 16:48.484
Uh, give me whatever this
pudge-ball's having. That looks good.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.153
Yeah, I'll have one of those too.

16:51.236 --> 16:52.988
I'm sorry, that was the last one.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.823
What? But I was next in line.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.285
Hey, excuse me.

16:58.369 --> 17:00.078
I was actually next in line.
You cut in front of me.

17:00.162 --> 17:01.330
That's the last King Kong Banana Split.

17:01.413 --> 17:02.873
I kind of feel like
you got to give that to me.

17:04.916 --> 17:05.834
I don't know.

17:05.917 --> 17:06.918
This guy's fucking talking to me.

17:07.002 --> 17:07.961
It's him.

17:19.223 --> 17:20.140
Hold on a second.

17:20.224 --> 17:21.433
What the hell are you talking about?

17:21.517 --> 17:23.268
I was next in line. You cut in front.

17:23.352 --> 17:24.895
Look, kid,
there's plenty of ice cream here.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.938
I don't have time for this shit.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.569
Oh, that is disgusting.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.280
Just get him to sign the fucking thing,
Greg!

17:56.343 --> 17:59.137
So, uh, I hooked up with Nina.

17:59.221 --> 18:01.557
Oh, nah, you should not have done that.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.974
What?
You were the one that told me to do it.

18:03.058 --> 18:04.268
You said it wasn't a big deal.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.144
Yeah, but that was
more of an abstract discussion.

18:06.228 --> 18:07.563
How was it abstract?

18:07.646 --> 18:09.106
It's a real person in my real life.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.568
If you get caught,
you could ruin these people's lives.

18:12.651 --> 18:13.527
I'm just saying, be careful, man.

18:13.611 --> 18:14.736
Be careful?

18:14.819 --> 18:15.946
Aren't you the one making your boss come

18:16.029 --> 18:17.697
a thousand times every 15 minutes?

18:17.781 --> 18:19.824
Yeah, but what we have is real, okay?

18:19.908 --> 18:21.577
Do not be fucking with our dynamics,
all right?

18:21.660 --> 18:23.662
The point is,
you are messing with a serious bond

18:23.745 --> 18:25.330
in this woman's life.

18:25.414 --> 18:27.332
It's like, it's not to be taken lightly.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.708
Why didn't you say this shit last time?

18:28.792 --> 18:30.001
I didn't think you'd actually
go through with it.

18:30.085 --> 18:30.919
Why not?

18:31.002 --> 18:32.379
Because you're a man of principles.

18:32.463 --> 18:34.131
That's something I've always respected
about you, Dev.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.382
Well, that's nice.

18:35.466 --> 18:36.716
Yeah, but I don't think that shit anymore,

18:36.800 --> 18:38.051
not after this.

18:38.135 --> 18:40.178
Well, whatever, all right?
It was a one-time thing.

18:40.262 --> 18:41.513
It's not a big deal.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.265
Her husband's not gonna murder me.

18:46.768 --> 18:50.397
It's Colin Salmon. He's FaceTiming me.

18:50.481 --> 18:52.357
I guess I got to take it.
It might be about CarMan.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.485
What the fuck is CarMan?
That sounds stupid.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.488
Hello?

18:57.571 --> 18:58.947
Hello? Dev?

18:59.030 --> 19:00.824
It's Colin Salmon.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.619
I need you to get over
to the apartment right away.

19:03.702 --> 19:05.621
I've got something really urgent.

19:05.704 --> 19:07.956
So if you can get over
as quickly as you can?

19:08.039 --> 19:10.000
Oh, okay, is this about CarMan?

19:10.083 --> 19:13.003
No, it's much more important than that.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.130
All right, well, um-- Uh, yeah,
just text me your address.

19:15.213 --> 19:16.340
I'll be right over.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.133
See you soon.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.346
What the fuck? Seems intense.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.430
All right, you got these, right?

19:23.514 --> 19:24.515
-I'll be right back.
-What?

19:24.598 --> 19:25.599
Well, actually, I'm not gonna come back.

19:25.683 --> 19:27.017
I'm just gonna leave.
But you got these, right?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.768
What the fuck? I guess.

19:28.852 --> 19:30.312
I'll hit you back at some point.

19:30.395 --> 19:31.855
You keep saying that.

19:34.065 --> 19:35.108
Colin?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.536
Hey, Colin?

19:45.619 --> 19:48.330
Just let me finish this sonnet.

20:04.763 --> 20:07.891
Dev, welcome.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.227
Wow, this is an amazing apartment.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.229
Yes, it is.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.314
You're just in time.

20:14.398 --> 20:16.775
I've got something very special
to show you.

20:27.035 --> 20:28.119
Holy shit!

20:29.120 --> 20:30.997
Did you make this?

20:31.081 --> 20:33.124
This is my passion project.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.167
Not many people realize,

20:34.251 --> 20:37.629
but I'm an amateur toppler.

20:37.713 --> 20:40.298
Would you like to initiate
the domino effect?

20:40.382 --> 20:42.050
-Me?
-Mm.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.635
I mean, don't you want to knock them down?

20:43.719 --> 20:45.970
It must have taken you hours
to set this up.

20:46.054 --> 20:47.723
Weeks, actually.

20:47.806 --> 20:50.267
But for me,
the joy comes from setting it all up.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.393

Oh, sure, yeah. Go ahead.

Hey there.

22:20.524 --> 22:21.817
Hey.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.861
It's Nina, remember?

22:23.943 --> 22:26.279
We had sex pretty recently.

22:26.363 --> 22:28.532
I was amazing, and you were okay.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.783
Hey, can you hush?

22:29.867 --> 22:31.451
We're in, like, a public place.

22:31.535 --> 22:32.703
I'm here with somebody.

22:32.786 --> 22:33.787
Oh, is she married too?

22:33.871 --> 22:35.539
-Is this your thing now?
-No!

22:35.622 --> 22:36.665
Shut up!

22:36.748 --> 22:38.709
Is this a hot date?

22:38.792 --> 22:40.377
Yeah, maybe.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.087
Come on, this is-- This is not a date.

22:43.171 --> 22:44.506
Why would you say that?

22:44.589 --> 22:46.049
Did you see what she was wearing?

22:46.132 --> 22:48.134
A hooded sweatshirt and New Balances?

22:48.218 --> 22:50.637
She just decided to keep it cas'.

22:50.721 --> 22:52.764
That is not what girls wear

22:52.848 --> 22:53.849
when they want to have sex with a guy.

22:53.932 --> 22:57.101
That's what they wear when they stay home
and eat cookie dough.

22:57.185 --> 22:58.228
Where'd you meet her?

22:58.311 --> 23:00.980
I met her
on a very exclusive dating website.

23:01.064 --> 23:02.900
You have to have
at least one shared interest

23:02.982 --> 23:04.025
before you get matched up.

23:04.108 --> 23:05.610
We both like movies.

23:05.694 --> 23:08.071
Okay, well, that explains it.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.406
Clearly, she's one of these girls

23:09.489 --> 23:11.157
who dates guys online for free food.

23:11.241 --> 23:14.285
Damn, she did order two entrees.

23:14.369 --> 23:15.662
Mark's flying out to LA tonight,

23:15.746 --> 23:17.748
so text me later.

23:24.713 --> 23:26.464
Everything okay with Steve?

23:26.548 --> 23:29.092
Oh, yeah, he just had to tell me
this super funny story.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.928
Should we talk about movies?

23:34.973 --> 23:36.266
Um, wow, it's a really nice night.

23:36.349 --> 23:37.684
Do you want to go grab a drink, maybe?

23:37.768 --> 23:39.477
Eh, I'm kind of tired.

23:39.561 --> 23:41.605
I should probably put the sea bass
in the fridge too.

23:41.688 --> 23:42.606
Yeah.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.065
Not to mention the short rib.

23:44.148 --> 23:45.984
And the chicken and crepes.

23:46.067 --> 23:47.736
I had a great time tonight.

23:47.819 --> 23:49.070
We should get dinner again next week.

23:49.153 --> 23:51.949
There's this amazing sushi place
that I want to try.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.117
Oh, all right, cool. That sounds good.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.493
Um, all right, well,
it was fun hanging out.

23:55.577 --> 23:56.578
Yeah.

24:00.665 --> 24:02.333
All right, bye.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.418
Bye.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.258
Fuck it.

24:18.934 --> 24:19.893
Oh, shit.

24:19.977 --> 24:21.436
-Oh, shit, it's Mark. Hide.
-What?

24:21.519 --> 24:22.729
-He's gonna hurt me.
-Fuck, hide now.

24:22.813 --> 24:23.730
Behind the telescope?

24:23.814 --> 24:24.773
Shit!

24:24.856 --> 24:26.817
Just get in the closet
and don't make a goddamn sound.

24:26.900 --> 24:27.901
Fuck.

24:31.863 --> 24:32.781
Hey.

24:32.864 --> 24:33.865
Hey, babe.

24:33.949 --> 24:35.700
What are you doing home?

24:35.784 --> 24:39.537
Well, turns out my flight's
not till tomorrow.

24:39.621 --> 24:42.749
Greg the moron screwed up my itinerary.

24:45.627 --> 24:46.628
No!

24:46.711 --> 24:47.796
No, you fucking don't!

24:47.879 --> 24:49.172
-Nina, who is this?
-Calm down.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.757
Mark, just calm down.

24:50.841 --> 24:52.091
-Who the fuck is this?
-I'm a contractor.

24:52.175 --> 24:53.384
I'm just here to fix the closet.

24:53.468 --> 24:55.178
I was just thinking about subletting
the apartment.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.972
He's a guy I was sleeping with, okay?

24:57.055 --> 24:59.098
I slept with this guy.

24:59.182 --> 25:01.351
You're cheating on me
with a little Indian guy?

25:01.434 --> 25:03.812
You didn't have to bring up
my ethnicity or my size.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.939
Wait a minute. I know you.

25:06.023 --> 25:07.190
Wait. How do I know you?

25:10.234 --> 25:11.903
You cut in line in front of me
at the ice cream store.

25:11.987 --> 25:13.030
You remember that?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.531
What?

25:14.614 --> 25:16.240
So you fucked my wife?

25:16.324 --> 25:17.701
It was the last King Kong Banana Split!

25:17.784 --> 25:19.243
You didn't even eat it!
You threw it in the trash!

25:19.327 --> 25:20.244
What is this ice cream thing?

25:20.328 --> 25:21.454
How the fuck can you do this to me?

25:21.538 --> 25:23.081
Oh, give me a fucking break, Mark.

25:23.164 --> 25:25.625
Like you weren't gonna bang some intern
as soon as you landed.

25:25.709 --> 25:26.543
You know what? I can't do this.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.461
I'm gonna leave, and this time,
I'm leaving for good.

25:31.339 --> 25:33.299
Why are you still here?

25:33.383 --> 25:34.467
You just said you were leaving.

25:34.551 --> 25:35.635
I thought it might be awkward if we were

25:35.719 --> 25:37.470
in the elevator together.

25:37.554 --> 25:39.514
Would you like to go first?
Should I go first?

25:39.597 --> 25:40.849
Get the fuck out of my house!

25:40.932 --> 25:42.976
Okay, I'll go first! I'm sorry, bye!

25:46.521 --> 25:48.065
Forgot my pants.

25:52.527 --> 25:55.321
Personally,
I think dryers are full of shit, man.

25:55.405 --> 25:57.032
Like, the whole no-wrinkle setting?

25:57.115 --> 25:58.575
Please, come on. Explain it to me.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.118
How is the heat different?

26:00.201 --> 26:01.703
Dude,
everybody knows the no-wrinkle setting

26:01.786 --> 26:02.913
isn't a real thing.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.956
You just get your shit out of there
as soon as it's done.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.417
Hurry up and fold it as soon as you can.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.668
Otherwise, the clothes get used to being

26:08.752 --> 26:09.669
in the wrinkled position.

26:09.753 --> 26:10.754
Yeah, but--

26:10.837 --> 26:12.380
Oh, shit.

26:12.463 --> 26:13.381
What are you doing?

26:13.464 --> 26:14.382
That's Mark.

26:14.465 --> 26:15.926
That's the dude whose wife I slept with.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.386
Oh, I forgot
you slept with that married woman.

26:18.469 --> 26:20.055
That was hilarious.

26:20.138 --> 26:22.348
Dude, shut up!

26:22.432 --> 26:24.517
Did you really do that
or just lie about it to impress me?

26:24.601 --> 26:25.977
Dev, is that you?

26:26.061 --> 26:27.562
Hey, man, I don't want any trouble.

26:27.645 --> 26:29.647
-I'm getting--
-Hey, look, we're cool.

26:30.732 --> 26:31.733
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

26:31.816 --> 26:32.650
Hey, sweetie.

26:32.734 --> 26:34.193
The Gellars said they're good
for dinner tonight.

26:34.277 --> 26:35.779
Hey.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.488
Hey.

26:37.572 --> 26:39.741
I-- God, I don't know what to say.

26:39.824 --> 26:41.159
I-- I'm sorry.

26:41.242 --> 26:43.078
I shouldn't have been involved with--

26:43.161 --> 26:45.496
Actually, that whole thing
brought to light

26:45.580 --> 26:46.706
some deeper problems in our marriage

26:46.790 --> 26:48.666
that we never would've addressed
had it not been for you.

26:48.750 --> 26:52.253
Yeah, I reevaluated my whole life.

26:52.336 --> 26:54.047
I took a lower position at my firm.

26:54.131 --> 26:56.424
We just went to Jamaica together.

26:56.507 --> 26:58.885
It was amazing.

26:58.969 --> 27:00.804
I have more time at home
for myself now too.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.056
Did you know I have an interest
in woodworking?

27:03.140 --> 27:04.599
I didn't know that.

27:04.682 --> 27:07.185
Now I have a fulfilling hobby.

27:07.268 --> 27:09.270
I made Nina a table last week.

27:09.353 --> 27:11.648
Felt so good.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.067
It's a fantastic table.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.904
Wow. Okay.

27:17.988 --> 27:19.697
So you're not gonna beat me up
or anything?

27:19.781 --> 27:21.825
No, no, man.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.869
Look, I mean, what you did was ugly.

27:24.953 --> 27:26.788
And we were being ugly to each other

27:26.871 --> 27:27.831
by cheating on each other.

27:27.914 --> 27:28.999
Yeah.

27:29.082 --> 27:32.585
And I'm not saying cheating's good
by any means,

27:32.669 --> 27:36.881
but a marriage... is a beautiful thing

27:36.965 --> 27:39.676
that you make together.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.179
And it has many parts,
one of which is monogamy.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.263
But the way we look at it, you don't just

27:44.347 --> 27:46.683
blow up the whole thing
'cause one part is broken.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.559
You try to fix that part.

27:48.643 --> 27:51.188
Like, if I had messed up one of the legs
on the table I made for Nina,

27:51.270 --> 27:52.981
I wouldn't throw out the whole table.

27:53.064 --> 27:54.191
I'd fix the leg.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.692
Right, honey?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.944
Yeah. Look, it's not perfect.

27:58.028 --> 28:01.739
But... it's real. It's life.

28:01.823 --> 28:02.740
Very real.

28:02.824 --> 28:04.575
Yeah.

28:04.659 --> 28:06.452
Wow, well, I'm glad this didn't end

28:06.536 --> 28:08.788
with you murdering me
like in those Richard Gere movies.

28:08.872 --> 28:10.874
He's not gonna beat you to death
with a snow globe

28:10.957 --> 28:13.459
and then wrap your body up in a rug

28:13.543 --> 28:15.003
and dump you in a landfill.

28:15.086 --> 28:16.129
-Unfaithful, Unfaithful.
-Yeah!

28:16.213 --> 28:17.797
It's a great movie.

28:17.881 --> 28:19.216
