WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.878
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.171
How many of those do you take?

00:04.254 --> 00:06.507
So my shrink doesn't wanna
tell her doctor friend

00:06.715 --> 00:09.134
that the ativan isn't
enough to calm me down,

00:09.176 --> 00:11.512
so I gotta go to a second
shrink and really pour it on.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.973
- You get,uh,terror sweats.
- Yeah.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.476
Have you talked to katy?You
talk to her on a regular basis?

00:17.559 --> 00:20.020
She hates living at home
with mom and the baby.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.355
She wanted to move in with you,

00:21.438 --> 00:23.649
but mom said that would only
happen over her dead body,

00:23.857 --> 00:26.026
so that's when she came up with
the whole private-school thing.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.445
- Don't say a word about this to your mother,ok?
- About what?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.572
And don't tell her about
the kelly thing either.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.406
Called your mother about the
berkshires thing,didn't you?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.200
I didn't call her.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.660
I know you called her,all right?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.870
- I did not call her.
- Whatever.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.205
I texted her.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.000
damian,being the mama's boy
that he is,waited,what,15 seconds

00:42.042 --> 00:44.586
before he called you
with the information.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.629
I'll be right back.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.297
I'm here with him because he's easy.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.549
I told you I'm not into boyfriends,

00:48.590 --> 00:52.177
and you got big,bad boatload of boyfriend
written all over your david bowie face.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.972
Tell me what's in the
box,or I open it myself.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.308
She's beautiful.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.768
She's dead.

01:05.107 --> 01:09.152
And I don't even care
about this other new chick.

01:09.236 --> 01:16.910
Do you really think she or janet
can make you twist like this?

01:17.411 --> 01:18.787
Who's up?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.163
Yeah,give me one.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.665
Yeah,you know what?Me,too.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.959
Thought we were supposed to
be doin' an intervention here.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.919
The family that drinks together...

01:26.003 --> 01:27.254
Sinks together.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.924
Easy,honey. Easy. Slow down.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.593
Where the hell'd ellie go to?

01:32.676 --> 01:34.803
She went to pick up
the dog at the kennel.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.105
Sure this is the,uh,A.A.Meetin' he's at?

01:47.482 --> 01:50.819
Guy I used to sponsor said he's been
here every day since the funeral,

01:51.570 --> 01:53.947
said he's talkin' about
how angry he still is.

01:53.989 --> 01:57.409
Yeah,of course,about ellie's death.

01:57.659 --> 02:01.538
That and us drinkin' at the funeral.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.082
And the wake.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.085
And in the church
during the funeral mass.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.670
Jesus.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.007
What an all-time goddamn low.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.093
Yeah.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.182
As opposed to havin' sex in a
church while you're still a priest.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.643
Those were the days.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.603
Are you kidding?

02:26.021 --> 02:28.357
I consider that to be a
personal all-time high.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.651
Hey,here he comes. Let me do the talkin'.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.990
Hey,ted.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.784
How you doin'?

02:43.121 --> 02:45.082
Teddy,hold on a minute,will you?Come on.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.459
Hey,how was the meeting,buddy?

02:48.502 --> 02:52.214
We-we just- we feel a little
responsibility here,you know?

02:52.339 --> 02:53.799
I mean,ellie,right?

02:53.882 --> 02:59.555
And,you know,I wish- we wish,you
know,and it's like-listen.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.557
What I'm tryin' to say is,you know,

03:01.682 --> 03:05.644
it's like I-I wouldn't blame you if
you wanted to haul off a-and hit me.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.816
You all right?You ok?

03:10.899 --> 03:12.359
Yeah,yeah.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.528
Be careful what you wish for,huh?

03:14.695 --> 03:17.990
Listen,kid,you got nothin'
to feel guilty about.

03:18.073 --> 03:24.830
What happened with ellie was
all my fault,not you,not tom,me.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.707
Then what'd you hit me for?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.041
I needed the release.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.420
Listen,personally I
feel a little guilty,

03:31.461 --> 03:33.380
because I think I was
pourin' heavy that night.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.551
No one put the bottle
back in her hand but me.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.929
That goddamn rediscover-the
love bullshit I was up to,

03:40.971 --> 03:43.265
it was just me bein' selfish.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.686
I wanted to drink again,'cause I
was miserable without the booze.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.192
Well,get a goddamn load of me
now,misery incarnate head to toe.

03:53.525 --> 03:57.404
I was the one who let her go to
pick up that stupid goddamn dog.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.574
I never even wanted that
goddamn shit machine.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.494
I only said yes to the idea so she'd
shut up her goddamn yap about it.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.874
Now she's dead,and I got a
4- legged asshole pomeranian

04:08.916 --> 04:11.960
who won't stop yappin'
its goddamn neuticles off.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.545
Neuti-neuticles?

04:13.629 --> 04:15.422
Fake balls.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.216
She had 'em put in when
they cut the real balls off,

04:18.300 --> 04:21.220
said it would help cupcake
with his self-esteem.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.349
She was worried about his self-esteem
and she called him cupcake?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.060
She was all about the contradictions.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.354
Jesus,mick.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.025
I might as well have put a bullet in her
head the day I started drinkin' again,

04:35.984 --> 04:38.070
so it's me I gotta straighten out.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.157
And,you guys-you guys just don't
worry yourself about all this.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.910
Ok?

04:45.077 --> 04:46.662
I love you guys.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.585
See you,ted.

05:43.677 --> 05:48.932
She has the baby happy,home,and
healthy for 6 months.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.684
Wakes up one day.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.061
Baby's coughing,uneasy.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.480
She thinks it's colicky. She
takes it to the doctor.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.484
24 hours later,the baby is dead.

06:01.069 --> 06:01.945
Bad heart.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.488
jesus christ.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.656
Marriage fell apart.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.700
Changed her whole life. You know.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.203
You know,if there is a god,he's
a pretty sick individual.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.789
Explains,though,why she
ran in to get that box.

06:12.831 --> 06:13.916
- Probably...
- Well,yeah.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.626
Only memory she has.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.294
Was all she had.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.171
- That's terrible.
- Awful.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.464
Did you bang her?

06:21.256 --> 06:22.424
What?

06:22.508 --> 06:23.842
Well,you smashed down her door.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.427
- No,I didn't bang her.
- It's a legitimate question.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.970
Let me explain somethin' to you.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.597
Sex was the last thing on my mind.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.559
I go in there. This woman has
a psychological breakdown,ok?

06:32.643 --> 06:33.352
You know what I did?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.521
I held her. That's what I did. I held her.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.942
It was like a-like
a- a healing process.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.985
And I'll tell you somethin'.If
you'd walked in in the middle of it,

06:42.110 --> 06:46.031
you wouldn't have known if I was
holding her or if she was holding me.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.577
It w-that's- that's how
incredible the experience was.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.454
That's pretty touching.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.372
Yeah.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.123
It was,actually.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.751
Did you have a boner?

07:00.504 --> 07:03.465
I just explained to you
what basically,for me,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.843
was like a religious experience,ok?

07:05.968 --> 07:08.512
I- it
was-

07:09.763 --> 07:14.351
yes,I had the biggest boner.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.854
It was like
a- it was weird.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.023
It was like a-like a-it
was like an empathy boner.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.859
It was...

07:22.818 --> 07:26.947
A- and I-you know,I
coul- no place to put it.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.116
Hey,do me a favor.

07:29.199 --> 07:33.161
Don't mention-'cause I- I told
kelly-it's such a personal,private thing.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.247
Obviously you're my best
friend,I tell you everything,

07:35.330 --> 07:39.960
but she- you don't tell anybody
about what I just told you.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.254
About the empathy boner?

07:42.838 --> 07:43.714
About the baby.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.215
- That's...
- Oh,yeah.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.427
But-but I could
talk about the boner.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.220
I mean,if it comes up.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.890
What's goin' on?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.726
Did you just-did you just,uh,hear
what we were just talkin' about?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.102
I don't know.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.145
What were you talkin' about?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.021
Boners.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.647
Why were you talkin' about boners?

08:00.689 --> 08:02.316
Because we could talk about
whatever the hell we want.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.317
We got seniority in this house.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.985
We sometimes talk about boners,

08:05.068 --> 08:07.779
giant boners,boners we
got,boners we're hopin' to have.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.156
We were talkin' about boners.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.284
- Hello.
- Franco's upstairs.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.536
Who?

08:17.372 --> 08:19.166
- First time for everything,I guess.
- Yeah.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.460
- I'm looking for tommy gavin.
- I'm tommy gavin.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.837
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.172
Ok,I don't know what this is about,

08:25.255 --> 08:28.884
but do not tell your mother
or anybody about this.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.136
All
right,wa-wa-wa-wait.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.179
I- is this a
stripper-gram thing?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.181
'Cause if this is a stripper-gram
thing,give me a minute,

08:34.222 --> 08:36.183
'cause I gotta activate
my cellphone camera.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.893
This-this is one of
those stripper-gram things.

08:37.976 --> 08:38.809
Get the phone ready.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.520
- Come on. Take a picture.
- I can't work it. Damian?

08:40.604 --> 08:41.730
Can I give you this?

08:41.772 --> 08:43.106
You can give me whatever you want.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.316
Great.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.567
Thanks.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.361
Tommy gavin...

08:47.402 --> 08:48.362
Yes.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.863
You've been served.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.406
Have a nice day.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.826
You gotta be shittin' me.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.121
Sometimes you guys just
make the job so easy.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.915
Thanks.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.502
Tu-turn the camera off,please.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.089
This is what makes me
pine for the old days,

09:07.172 --> 09:08.966
when all the process servers were men.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.301
There was a lot less danger
of fallin' for a pretty face.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.803
You were lookin' at her face?

09:13.387 --> 09:14.596
What'd they nail you with?

09:15.430 --> 09:16.890
Divorce papers.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.559
It's about freakin' time.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.395
You ok?

09:21.979 --> 09:22.563
Yeah.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.064
That's it?

09:24.106 --> 09:25.107
"Yeah"?

09:25.399 --> 09:28.610
This event has been hovering over
your- your life for so many years,

09:28.694 --> 09:32.072
and when it finally happens,that's all
y- you got is a one-syllable response?

09:32.114 --> 09:33.657
Jesus christ.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.910
I'm good.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.790
Yeah,you're good.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.001
And I've known you long enough to know

09:44.084 --> 09:46.044
that right now the wheels
are already spinning,

09:46.128 --> 09:48.672
and you're planning
your secret evil plan

09:48.714 --> 09:52.176
to get revenge on your
soon-to-be ex-mrs. Gavin.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.468
Bingo.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.469
I love it when I'm right.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.722
Wait. Why do you gotta get revenge?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.347
I mean,what do you care?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.183
I thought you were
bangin' that kelly chick.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.351
Who said I was banging kelly?

10:01.435 --> 10:04.688
I called her the other day to ask her
out,and she said that you two were,

10:05.063 --> 10:09.193
uh-you had a thing or you have a thing
goin' on,so that's why I backed down.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.821
Please tell me that you did not mention
anything about the thing to your mother.

10:12.905 --> 10:13.739
No.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.240
He answered too quickly.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.285
I- I'm not gonna ask you again.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.787
Well,let me think.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.040
Yeah.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.792
It's unbelievable.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.586
let me-let
me guess.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.296
It was on goddamn
laundry night,wasn't it?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.393
What do you want?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.771
Sit down,'cause,uh,we got a problem.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.814
Oh,we have a huge problem,all right,

10:47.898 --> 10:51.276
and it's sitting in front of
me in a cheap cotton polyblend.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.779
I'm only gonna say this once.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.658
Sit down,or I will
kick you in the vagina.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.035
And you know I will.

11:03.330 --> 11:08.877
Never,ever reference my
vagina ever again ever.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.340
Now,what do you want?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.634
Ok,so,look.

11:15.717 --> 11:19.012
We loathe each other,but let's admit it.

11:19.096 --> 11:23.141
We're also kind of enjoying this
death struggle over who gets tommy,

11:23.267 --> 11:26.895
which is also sort of like fighting
to see who gets the ebola virus.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.273
you know,one of us is gonna win.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.739
One of us is gonna lose.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.527
Them's the rules,and we are
fine with them,except now,

11:33.610 --> 11:36.697
the rules have changed,'cause
we have an interloper.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.866
We have a trespasser.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.993
I know about the new chick.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.619
Kelly something.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.539
And of course she has to have the
quintessential goddamn irish name.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.416
He is so goddamn predictable.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.585
Well,you don't seem
that concerned about it.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.170
You know,when push comes to shove,

11:51.253 --> 11:53.672
I'm pretty confident that he's
finally gonna come to his senses,

11:53.755 --> 11:57.509
especially since I'm about to
shove him in the right direction.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.137
I just served him divorce papers.

12:01.555 --> 12:07.227
What a coincidink,'cause i am
about to serve him with these.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.939
I'm leaving.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.025
She lost a child.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.907
What?

12:19.948 --> 12:22.659
She had a baby few years ago,

12:22.743 --> 12:26.371
and it only lived for,like,a
month or 2 months or something.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.624
I don't know. Damian didn't really
hear the whole thing,but anyway,

12:28.707 --> 12:30.542
it's supposed to be this huge secret,

12:31.502 --> 12:35.130
and she opened up to
tommy,of all people.

12:35.547 --> 12:40.677
So,you see,it's not just
a sex thing anymore,ok,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.930
it's a grief connection,

12:43.430 --> 12:47.392
just like he has with you
and just like he has with me.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.230
So what do we do?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.398
We're gonna 86 her.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.775
What,kill her?

12:55.400 --> 12:55.984
Oh,my god.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.694
If I didn't think that
would break under pressure

12:57.819 --> 13:00.405
and blab everything to the
police like a little pussy,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.115
then yeah,I would consider that,

13:02.199 --> 13:09.081
except we are gonna kill her
with kindness and concern,ok?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.332
Tommy is a maniac.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.459
He has hurt us both very badly.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.753
We're gonna go,we're gonna talk
to her,we're gonna warn her,

13:14.795 --> 13:18.715
and we are gonna scare the
ever-loving shit out of her.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.260
Agreed?

13:22.386 --> 13:23.846
Agreed.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.014
When do we do this?

13:27.391 --> 13:28.357
Here is the address.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.644
Meet me in front of
her place in 2 hours.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.481
Damian had that written
down. I was kind of snooping.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.610
One more thing before I forget.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.279
I can't believe I almost forgot this.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.822
This is really important.

13:42.990 --> 13:48.996
Janet,please do not forget your...

13:49.037 --> 13:50.497
Vagina.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.305
Sit down.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.267
if I'd known I was gonna have
company,I would have got dressed.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.186
Just got back from pilates.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.271
yeah. I heard of those.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.230
You get results?

14:15.314 --> 14:17.316
I've never actually done
any of the exercises.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.485
My instructor is this greek guy with
an amazing ass,so he shows me the moves,

14:20.611 --> 14:23.071
and then I pretend to pull a
hamstring,and he stretches me.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.199
Just give me 2 seconds to get dressed.

14:26.234 --> 14:27.534
Oh,no,no. You look-
you look great.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.244
2 seconds. Help yourself to some wine.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.705
Thank you!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.499
That's very kind of you.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.792
She's a mutt.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.462
Yeah,she's a brunette. That's
a big part of it.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.090
She's got those squinty little eyes.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.425
That's attractive.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.260
You know,I thought she was kind of cute.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.261
She's cute like a boy.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.680
She has a figure like a 2x4.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.557
She has a great ass.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.642
What,you looked?

14:51.683 --> 14:54.102
Of course I looked. You always
check out the enemy's ass.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.687
At least,I do.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.856
Guess that means
you've checked out mine.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.234
You know,tommy likes the shape.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.819
He didn't mention the size?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.196
You know,I quit smoking.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.405
How's the wine?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.202
it-it's good. It
tastes like chicken.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.119
Really?

15:11.245 --> 15:12.496
Yeah.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.500
And I'm not one of those people
that gets other tastes in wine.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.293
Licorice,butterscotch-all
that bullshit,

15:18.335 --> 15:20.254
it all just pretty much
tastes like booze to me.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.214
Tastes good to me.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.051
Listen,kelly,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.428
you have a really beautiful place here,

15:28.512 --> 15:31.265
and you are an attractive enough lady.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.267
Although,they have this new thing.

15:33.350 --> 15:37.062
It's a laser thing that just kinda
lifts the eyes,just a little thing.

15:37.145 --> 15:37.855
You heard of that?

15:37.938 --> 15:38.522
No?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.606
Nothing?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.276
So we know that you've been
spending a lot of time with tommy.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.695
Ok.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.490
And,um,we don't know you,but,uh,

15:48.532 --> 15:51.535
let's say you saw someone driving
the wrong way down a one-way street.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.953
You'd honk your horn,right?

15:52.995 --> 15:56.290
Or if they were about to walk off
the side of a cliff,you'd speak up.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.125
Which is why we're here.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.711
Just keep drinking,all right?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.754
Tommy's a good-lookin' guy,

16:02.796 --> 16:05.340
and we,more
than anybody-

16:05.382 --> 16:06.967
we can understand how
you'd be wowed by-

16:07.050 --> 16:09.011
Actually,I think he's kind of scrawny.

16:09.094 --> 16:09.928
Oh?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.513
And pretty beat-up.

16:11.597 --> 16:14.099
I mean,breathe on him the wrong
way,you break a bone,right?

16:15.684 --> 16:17.436
Yeah,she's funny,too.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.148
Tommy's really screwed up.

16:21.190 --> 16:23.859
He's a bottomless pit of anger,

16:23.942 --> 16:28.655
and kind of destroys anybody that
he comes into contact with,you know,

16:28.780 --> 16:33.785
and what kind of people would we
be,really,if we didn't warn you?

16:34.161 --> 16:35.287
What was your name again?

16:35.329 --> 16:36.497
That is sheila.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.123
I could do it.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.877
- My name is sheila.
- So you're the ex-wife.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.253
Gonna be.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.630
Soon.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.635
Listen,girls,I don't
wanna be a bad hostess,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.929
but I think I can wrap
this up real quick.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.056
Uh,I know tommy is damaged.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.474
He's a goddamn train wreck.

16:55.557 --> 17:00.562
And while I appreciate your concern,you
two strike me as a couple of ladies

17:00.646 --> 17:05.150
who found a really lousy thrill
ride at a shitty carnival,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.194
but it's your lousy ride
and your shitty carnival,

17:08.278 --> 17:12.241
so you'll be goddamned if anybody's
gonna cut the line,hop on,and take a spin.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.412
Really?

17:17.538 --> 17:21.875
'Cause,uh,you strike me
as the kind of lady who,

17:21.959 --> 17:25.127
if she wasn't already
spinning on top of tommy,

17:25.212 --> 17:29.466
would be smart enough to haul ass
in any direction that he wasn'T.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.425
Not that it's any of your business,

17:30.509 --> 17:33.470
but I haven't,spun him yet.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.722
Oh,yeah,right.

17:36.139 --> 17:36.890
I haven'T.

17:36.974 --> 17:39.309
What we did,it
was-it was,uh,private.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.687
Oh,cut the shit.

17:42.271 --> 17:43.981
What are you talkin'
about?You're talkin' about head?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.566
It wasn't head.

17:45.649 --> 17:49.987
Well,if you didn't sleep with
him and you didn't go down on him,

17:50.070 --> 17:51.613
wh-what else is there?

17:52.531 --> 17:53.740
Y- yoga?

17:58.328 --> 17:59.830
He held me.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.168
I was having a moment,and he held me.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.797
J- just wait a minute.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.929
- "Head" or "held"?
- Held.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.848
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.518
Head-head I can
understand,but not held.

18:23.979 --> 18:27.733
When you say,"held," you
mean he held you down,right?

18:27.816 --> 18:30.444
- 'Cause me and him,we do that all the time.
- me,too.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.321
No.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.780
He hugged me.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.283
He comforted me.

18:36.909 --> 18:38.410
Bullshit.

18:39.703 --> 18:43.332
This is my tommy gavin
that we're talking about?

18:43.415 --> 18:45.626
And my tommy gavin?

18:45.667 --> 18:49.838
Evil smile,complicated eyes,girl hair?

18:50.047 --> 18:52.799
Yeah,tommy gavin,he don't hug.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.551
Well,he hugged me.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.513
And while this has been a major blast,I have
a meeting downtown that I have to get to,

18:57.679 --> 18:59.723
so I'm going to have to ask
you to come back another time,

18:59.765 --> 19:03.685
like possibly never,and I sure
hope that wasn't too bitchy.

19:04.728 --> 19:08.690
- Nope,not too bitchy,just bitchy enough.
- Great.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.400
I'll let you guys see
yourselves out,then.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.569
And again,thank you for your
concern,but I'm a big girl.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.446
I could take care of myself.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.116
Sorry to hear about your daughter.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.872
What?

19:24.081 --> 19:27.251
Did-you had a baby
girl that died,right?

19:28.001 --> 19:31.880
janet had a son that died,and
I had a miscarriage myself.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.133
It's,um- it's
tough stuff.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.224
Who told you that?

19:43.642 --> 19:44.643
I'm sorry. What?

19:44.685 --> 19:46.311
Who told you that?

19:47.479 --> 19:49.147
Who do you think?

19:50.315 --> 19:51.984
Tried to warn ya.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.370
Yeah,and I can't believe
that you brought up the baby.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.831
I mean,that is too low,even for you.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.417
Oh,you really screwed that up.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.379
Um,I had to screw it up,'cause
I was the only one in there.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.047
Where the hell were you?

20:14.089 --> 20:15.340
- Oh,where was I?
- Yeah.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.426
Oh,I'll tell you where i was.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.636
I was taking the high road.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.847
You were taking the highball road.

20:21.930 --> 20:22.890
That's what you were doin'.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.475
I always wondered why you
married a drunk,and now I know.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.769
It's because you happen
to be one yourself!

20:27.811 --> 20:28.812
Oh,you take that back.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.480
I will not,you big,fat lush.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.440
Take that back.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.400
Oh,my god. You pushed me.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.776
You pushed me!

20:40.616 --> 20:42.576
Oh,you bitch.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.661
You think you can mess with me?

20:46.788 --> 20:47.831
Oh,my god.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.833
Did you just throw your shoe at me?

20:49.917 --> 20:51.752
What are you,5?

20:52.586 --> 20:53.795
My ass.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.088
All right,you wanna throw?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.674
We'll throw some
things. I'll throw something.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.512
How 'bout this,You
wanna throw?You wanna go?

21:02.179 --> 21:03.180
Bring it on.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.973
Do you want me to bring it on?

21:05.057 --> 21:06.683
I'm gonna bring it on.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.564
Nice toss.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.818
Stop it!What are you two doin'?

21:16.853 --> 21:19.530
Stop!

21:19.613 --> 21:22.533
- Both of you,stop!
- Who the hell are you?Get the hell out of here.

21:22.574 --> 21:23.867
- Excuse me.
- What?

21:23.909 --> 21:25.285
Where did you get that bra?

21:25.369 --> 21:27.287
Get that out of my face.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.513
Run,you moron!

21:49.768 --> 21:51.895
Oh,hey,thanks for getting my shoe.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.698
- Can I come in?
- No.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.324
Do me a favor,all right?

22:04.408 --> 22:05.826
Forget I live here. Forget my name.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.327
Just forget all of it.

22:07.828 --> 22:08.871
What's goin' on?

22:08.954 --> 22:12.499
What's goin' on is just when I
think I am the smartest goddamn broad

22:12.583 --> 22:13.709
I would ever have the
pleasure of meeting,

22:13.792 --> 22:16.962
I go and do something stupid
like tell you about my kid.

22:17.421 --> 22:20.674
And you were so comforting
and so simpatico,

22:20.716 --> 22:23.844
and I'm just wondering
which one you told first.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.637
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

22:25.721 --> 22:29.308
Which one did you tell first,you goddamn
liar,your girlfriend or your wife?

22:29.391 --> 22:31.143
They were both here. They
knew the whole story.

22:31.178 --> 22:32.102
They-they
were here?

22:32.144 --> 22:35.606
I'm gonna guess the girlfriend,'cause
she was really loaded for bear.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.024
Ok,ok. Let me-let me
come in and explain.

22:37.107 --> 22:40.319
Wa-wa-wait. Ok. All right,I
told-I told one person.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.028
I told lou,ok,and
that's only because-

22:42.063 --> 22:43.655
you know,you met him at the firehouse.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.741
He's my best friend,and he
had seen the box at the fire,

22:45.866 --> 22:48.243
- and he was wondering what was in the box...
- Oh,so,what,lou told sheila?

22:48.327 --> 22:49.411
No. There's no way.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.455
Lou would never
tell-wh-what happened?

22:51.497 --> 22:54.333
Well,they came here. We had
a nice little girl chat.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.419
They sucked down a bottle of my
wine,insulted me and each other,

22:57.461 --> 23:01.381
and then they went outside and had a knock-down,drag-out
fight for all the neighborhood to see.

23:01.715 --> 23:02.549
That's them.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.384
Yeah. Well,tommy,you
know what?This is over.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.512
I cannot take the chance
of turning into one of them.

23:06.595 --> 23:10.098
That little one,jesus christ,she
was like joe pesci with tits.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.892
You know,you should just
go back to your ex-wife,

23:11.975 --> 23:13.810
'cause at least she
seems like a happy drunk.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.103
S- she served me with divorce papers.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.523
Ok,then. I guess you
only have one choice.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.026
- You.
- No. Joe pesci.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.239
You really think that's the chick I'm
gonna spend the rest of my life with?

23:25.864 --> 23:28.242
Yeah. You know-you
know- you know,

23:28.659 --> 23:32.579
the rest of your life,tommy,is
gonna be a goddamn circus,

23:33.205 --> 23:35.374
and she's the ringmaster.

23:35.624 --> 23:38.794
So why don't you do us all
a favor and just give in?

24:05.654 --> 24:09.074
Oh,my god.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.326
It's ok.

24:12.286 --> 24:14.204
You scared me.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.498
There you go.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.417
Ok.

24:29.428 --> 24:30.804
Too tight?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.227
- How's that?
- Good.

24:37.311 --> 24:38.896
- You all right?
- Yes.

24:42.316 --> 24:46.153
You know,don't know why...

24:48.572 --> 24:54.077
it took me so
long-to figure out-

24:57.498 --> 25:07.758
that you-are
the one.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.470
So hang on.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.722
I got a surprise.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.641
You're gonna like this.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.809
Oh,my god.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.396
This is just like a dream.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.400
Actually,I've had this dream.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.279
Get in here!What are you doing?!

25:29.363 --> 25:30.948
So...

25:31.615 --> 25:33.492
how long would you say...

25:34.660 --> 25:38.914
it would take you to replace
all these pills,ballpark?

25:39.957 --> 25:42.000
a goddamn long time.

25:42.876 --> 25:48.382
I told you it's like 2 different shrinks,3
different doctors,4 different stories,I think.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.091
Why?

25:49.174 --> 25:53.387
So basically we're talkin'
a- a minimum of 2 days,

25:54.012 --> 25:58.183
you know,between the phone calls
and the emergency shrink appointments

25:58.267 --> 26:01.019
and more phone calls,not to
mention the terror sweats.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.146
And also my withdrawals. What of it?

26:03.230 --> 26:05.858
Oh,yeah. Withdrawals.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.234
Yeah.

26:07.526 --> 26:09.611
Completely forgot about the...

26:10.571 --> 26:12.114
Withdrawals.

26:14.783 --> 26:19.580
With-drawl-els.

26:20.372 --> 26:23.917
Hey,what are you doin'... With my pills?

26:26.628 --> 26:29.214
What-hey!

26:29.548 --> 26:31.800
What are
you-oh,shit!

26:31.884 --> 26:33.927
How dare you touch my pills?!

26:33.969 --> 26:36.972
Damn it!Put it out!

26:38.098 --> 26:39.558
Tommy.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.978
What are you doing?

26:47.524 --> 26:49.276
What are you doing?Don't!

26:49.484 --> 26:51.069
Stop it.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.197
Don'T.Cut it out. That's not funny.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.866
Don'T.It's not funny,tommy.

26:56.492 --> 26:57.743
Tommy!

26:59.661 --> 27:01.830
Don'T.It's not funny.

27:04.458 --> 27:05.918
stop it.

27:06.043 --> 27:07.419
Tommy,this is not funny.

27:07.461 --> 27:10.339
Don'T.You stupid idiot!

27:10.380 --> 27:12.883
Cut it out.

27:22.226 --> 27:29.316
The next time you wanna take
something that belongs to me

27:29.399 --> 27:36.490
and squeeze all the hope and
breath and the promise out of it,

27:37.950 --> 27:40.577
terror sweats'll be the
least of your problems.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.749
Ok?

27:57.636 --> 27:58.887
See ya.

28:02.558 --> 28:06.144
Wait.

28:07.813 --> 28:09.314
Tommy!

28:13.735 --> 28:15.612
You know,this is insanity,

28:15.696 --> 28:17.614
which I know is-is
business as usual for you,

28:17.698 --> 28:20.284
but for the rest of us
here on planet earth...

28:20.409 --> 28:24.204
Don't tell me that you are
thinking of backing out.

28:24.288 --> 28:26.248
I was never in,dipshit.

28:26.331 --> 28:30.919
The only reason why I came out here tonight was to try
to talk some sense into that thick irish skull of yours.

28:31.003 --> 28:34.923
Tommy,may i remind you that
kidnapping is a federal offense?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.675
Ok. You know you happen to
be katy's favorite uncle.

28:36.717 --> 28:38.093
- Did you know that?Ok?
- Oh,that's great. Great.

28:38.177 --> 28:39.845
She can come visit me in prison.

28:39.887 --> 28:42.890
- I'm not moving,tom.
- Ok. It's fine.

28:43.015 --> 28:44.600
I don't need you. I
can do this by myself.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.351
Since I'm the only one
in the car with any balls,

28:46.435 --> 28:49.146
I am gonna get out right
now and do it by myself,ok?

28:50.522 --> 28:51.815
Lou?

28:52.941 --> 28:55.277
God,you-
Christ.

28:57.029 --> 28:58.280
- Holy...
- jesus,mary,joseph.

28:58.363 --> 28:59.990
Katy,what are you doin' here?

29:00.032 --> 29:01.492
I saw you pull up a while ago.

29:01.575 --> 29:03.243
I thought you were some
guys cruisin' for gay sex.

29:03.327 --> 29:04.453
- No!
- We're not.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.748
- Why would...
- I saw a documentary about aids on pbs.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.500
Wh-why would you-this
is why we're taking her,

29:09.583 --> 29:11.084
because the- your
mother should...

29:11.168 --> 29:13.212
So you're,like,kidnapping me?

29:13.337 --> 29:15.255
No,we're
not gonna-

29:15.339 --> 29:18.634
listen,first of all,a father
cannot kidnap his own child.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.260
That's not legally possible. It's...

29:20.344 --> 29:23.680
Well,actually,daddy,unless you have legal
custody rights,you could be charged-

29:23.847 --> 29:25.015
W- we're kidnapping you.

29:25.057 --> 29:26.350
We're kidnapping you,but
it's not what you think.

29:26.391 --> 29:29.728
It-we-it's more
like a bonding thing.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.528
Me,you,and colleen,we're gonna bond.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.398
We're gonna be in the
same apartment and bond.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.109
- You know,I mean- I know you
love mom,but... - Not really.

29:36.652 --> 29:37.444
No?

29:37.569 --> 29:39.571
Mom's a total raving bitch.

29:39.655 --> 29:40.823
And where's her judgment?

29:40.906 --> 29:42.699
Remember that dwight
guy in the wheelchair?

29:42.741 --> 29:46.370
Who brings a freak like that into
a young child's home environment?

29:46.662 --> 29:47.746
Get me out of here.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.706
I wasn't gonna say
anything about the dwight-

29:49.748 --> 29:51.834
Honey,oh-no.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.963
what about-don't you-
don't you have to pack a bag?

29:56.004 --> 29:57.422
You can buy me whatever I need.

29:57.506 --> 29:58.507
Right.

29:58.549 --> 29:59.800
Wh-what about the baby sitter?

29:59.842 --> 30:00.843
Oh,don't worry.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.679
When she went downstairs to check the
laundry,I locked her in the basement.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.348
And what-the
baby?

30:06.431 --> 30:07.474
I gave him 2 teaspoons of benadryl.

30:07.516 --> 30:08.934
He's out like a light.

30:09.977 --> 30:11.228
God,tommy.

30:12.437 --> 30:13.814
You must be so proud.

30:16.859 --> 30:18.944
All right,boys,ththe doors are
locked. Hatches are battened down.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.238
We're officially in
staff-only drinkin' mode.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.950
All right,before we,uh,start imbibing
in earnest,I'd like the floor.

30:25.659 --> 30:30.289
To ellie. May god kiss and rest her soul.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.582
Amen to that.

30:31.665 --> 30:35.377
And,tom,if I could just add,to teddy.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.670
Goddamn rock.

30:36.712 --> 30:37.921
Mount goddamn rushmore.

30:38.005 --> 30:39.006
It's inspirational.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.632
Absolutely.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.843
He owes me 800 bucks.

30:43.635 --> 30:45.345
For chrissakes. For what?

30:45.512 --> 30:46.847
For the pipers.

30:47.014 --> 30:49.266
You know,whoever's job
it was to pay the pipers,

30:49.301 --> 30:51.894
you know,th-they forgot,or who knows,

30:51.935 --> 30:54.021
but,you know,the lead guy corners me.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.647
He says he needs the money.

30:57.524 --> 30:58.483
Jesus christ.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.319
Who the hell's that,king goddamn kong?

31:00.360 --> 31:02.529
No. He drinks at a bar down
by the empire state building.

31:02.571 --> 31:05.199
- We're closed!
- Open up. It's me.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.283
Jeez. It's teddy.

31:06.492 --> 31:08.869
All right,listen. Everybody
be as upbeat as possible,ok?

31:08.904 --> 31:09.578
Good.

31:09.661 --> 31:10.370
Now,listen.

31:10.454 --> 31:11.545
Don't mention the friggin' money.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.707
Franco,you gorgeous
hunk of man meat,you.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.833
Hey!

31:14.875 --> 31:15.918
How you doin',boys?

31:16.001 --> 31:17.461
How's your ball sacs?

31:18.212 --> 31:19.254
How's your wife,lou?

31:19.296 --> 31:21.548
Oh,great. I stole all her
money,and I kicked her out.

31:22.508 --> 31:23.634
Just as well.

31:23.717 --> 31:27.262
That marriage had as much chance
as me bangin' charlize theron.

31:28.222 --> 31:31.808
Hey,tom,give me 10 glasses
here,best irish whiskey.

31:31.892 --> 31:32.643
10?

31:32.726 --> 31:34.978
Yeah,and make 'em large,too,3 fingers.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.688
What's the good word,eddie?

31:38.607 --> 31:40.692
you know,I wasn't gonna bring this up,

31:41.318 --> 31:43.737
but since you're in such good spirits,

31:45.697 --> 31:48.283
I kinda got stuck payin' for
the pipers for-for the funeral.

31:48.367 --> 31:52.996
I mean,not to bring up that
sad subject,but,uh,it was $800.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.957
You know,it was $800 I
wasn't plannin' on spendin',

31:55.082 --> 31:57.376
so I'm sorry,teddy,but if
you could write me a check

31:57.459 --> 31:59.336
o- or if you got the cash...

32:06.510 --> 32:08.846
You know what?I can-I
can write it off.

32:09.263 --> 32:10.556
I'll write it off.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.391
Hey,I'll tell you what.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.475
It's on me,all right?

32:13.517 --> 32:15.435
No worries,brother. No worries.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.189
Hey,ted.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.149
Yeah,mick?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.861
Is,uh-is
that a lighter?

32:24.945 --> 32:26.405
No.

32:27.823 --> 32:30.325
Enjoy the drinks you
have in your hands,boys,

32:30.826 --> 32:36.081
'cause after that,the only thing you're pourin'
down your gullet tonight is ginger ale or coffee.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.002
You won't go to A.A.,

32:40.294 --> 32:42.212
I'll bring A.A.To you.

32:44.798 --> 32:49.052
I just got one bullet
in this baby,just one.

32:50.137 --> 32:53.140
The whole thing with
ellie,I blame myself.

32:54.266 --> 32:55.893
Do a shot,tom.

32:56.894 --> 32:58.562
Ok.

33:06.820 --> 33:10.949
the way I look at it,if I
hadn't started drinkin' again,

33:12.117 --> 33:14.161
she wouldn't have started either.

33:15.329 --> 33:17.581
Do another shot,tom,please.

33:21.502 --> 33:23.045
Ok.

33:32.179 --> 33:34.473
And one more.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.601
I'm-I'm
ok.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.436
These are huge.

33:39.471 --> 33:41.188
Do another shot.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.278
Ok.

34:00.374 --> 34:02.501
So I been goin' to meetings.

34:02.543 --> 34:04.419
I haven't touched a drop.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.798
But the guilt,I don't
think I can shake that,

34:08.257 --> 34:10.967
so I decided I have to
make the ultimate amends.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.554
I gotta kill myself.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.764
Only problem is I can'T.

34:17.349 --> 34:18.391
I'm not drinkin' no more,

34:18.433 --> 34:21.770
so it's practically impossible
for me to work up the balls.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.857
Tom,do another shot.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.984
Te-teddy,I...

34:27.067 --> 34:30.571
Do another shot now.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.541
So I figure I'd put a bullet in this gun

34:43.167 --> 34:45.502
and I give the gun to somebody else.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.547
Say they're drunk or high or whatever,

34:48.922 --> 34:51.257
who's to say they
won't do the job for me?

34:52.134 --> 34:54.719
Tom,do another shot.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.681
Teddy,I-I
can'T.I-

34:57.764 --> 34:59.141
Ted,he's-he's
already-

34:59.183 --> 35:02.019
Mick,I swear on my dead wife's soul

35:02.060 --> 35:05.647
I will rip your freakin'
head out of your goddamn neck!

35:07.900 --> 35:10.402
Tom,drink.

35:20.329 --> 35:22.414
Did you drink much before I showed up?

35:23.624 --> 35:25.167
Little more than usual.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.502
Good.

35:26.585 --> 35:28.295
This should work out great,then.

35:29.463 --> 35:30.339
You feelin' a little lightheaded?

35:30.380 --> 35:31.340
Yeah.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.883
Perfect.

35:33.759 --> 35:36.303
You remember the name bubba cohen?

35:36.887 --> 35:39.097
Friend of your old
man's back in the day.

35:39.473 --> 35:44.895
Big guy,dumber than drywall,got
mobbed up around age 19,

35:45.312 --> 35:48.273
got a job as a leg-breaker
for the local guinea mob.

35:49.399 --> 35:52.152
One night,he went down
to sully's taphouse

35:52.236 --> 35:55.572
drunk as a skunk,mouthed
off to the wrong mook.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.867
Walkin' out to the car that night,

35:58.951 --> 36:02.079
someone ran up behind
him,put 5 bullets in his back.

36:04.248 --> 36:05.916
So much for bubba,huh?

36:06.124 --> 36:08.418
You'd think so,but he didn't die.

36:09.127 --> 36:12.130
Guy was an animal,huge,size of a shed,

36:12.165 --> 36:14.007
but that ain't what saved him.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.342
On the night in question,

36:15.425 --> 36:19.721
he drank 19 beers and a whole
goddamn bottle of jameson'S.

36:19.847 --> 36:23.600
Doctors said he had so much booze in
his system that it got to the point

36:23.684 --> 36:28.605
where it slowed his heart down so
much,he was unable to bleed to death.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.483
You see,that's my problem.

36:31.567 --> 36:36.155
If I wanna off myself,I gotta drink my
weight in booze just to pull the trigger.

36:36.405 --> 36:39.324
Then I'll be so shitfaced,I
won't be able to kick the bucket.

36:39.408 --> 36:43.829
Now,I got this gun here with
5 empty chambers and one round,

36:44.121 --> 36:46.874
so the odds are stacked
pretty much in my favor.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.710
But why don't we all
just leave it to fate?

36:50.419 --> 36:52.087
You wanna do the honors,tom?

36:53.505 --> 36:56.049
No,teddy,I-I really-
I really don'T.

36:56.133 --> 36:57.593
I didn't think so.

36:58.635 --> 36:59.803
Shit!

36:59.887 --> 37:03.390
Jesus christ. 5 empty chambers,I
hit him with the first shot.

37:03.432 --> 37:06.894
Why can't I get those kind of results
when I'm playin' the goddamn lottery?

37:10.189 --> 37:11.398
Shit!

37:11.440 --> 37:13.192
There was another bullet in there.

37:13.567 --> 37:16.612
I swear I think I'm comin' down
with the goddamn alzheimer'S.

37:16.695 --> 37:18.530
Teddy,goddamn it,what are you doin'?

37:21.658 --> 37:22.993
Ok,ok!

37:23.076 --> 37:25.120
I said I had one round in that gun.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.663
Sorry,2.

37:26.997 --> 37:30.083
But this,this is a glock 17.

37:30.334 --> 37:35.214
This has got 19 rounds,so
that means I got 16 left.

37:35.255 --> 37:37.508
And by the by,just so you know,

37:37.549 --> 37:40.761
I'm sober as a judge,in
case anybody's wonderin'.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.846
So why don't we all be nice little kids

37:42.930 --> 37:46.016
and put your cellphones or
your high-tech textin' toys,

37:46.058 --> 37:48.101
put 'em on the bar right
over there right now?

37:48.143 --> 37:50.270
Come on. Get 'em up
there so I could see 'em.

37:51.438 --> 37:52.564
That's it.

37:53.690 --> 37:55.150
All of 'em.

37:57.319 --> 37:59.321
'Cause I want you
guys to know somethin'.

37:59.613 --> 38:01.031
I'm not playin'.

38:01.365 --> 38:03.158
Old grand-dad bottle,third shelf.

38:05.077 --> 38:06.870
Smirnoff bottle,second shelf.

38:07.162 --> 38:09.289
- All right,all right.
- Teddy,goddamn it!

38:09.331 --> 38:15.003
Which is my way of sayin' anyone makes
a move at me or tries to go for help...

38:17.631 --> 38:22.719
so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna sit here for the next few hours

38:23.387 --> 38:26.139
and watch tom slowly fade away.

38:27.432 --> 38:30.269
Teddy,what are you doin'?

38:30.310 --> 38:33.605
You told me-you said
it was none of our fault.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.274
Yes. Yes,I did.

38:35.315 --> 38:37.276
Yeah,but you're blamin' tom.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.570
I guess I'm in denial.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.074
Get out of there.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.329
There's this thing they call karma.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.290
I'm sure you heard about it.

38:51.665 --> 38:54.918
You live a shitty
life,usually before it's over,

38:55.002 --> 38:58.005
bad karma comes back and
bites you in the balls.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.967
You act like an asshole,maybe
you get cancer of the ass.

39:02.134 --> 39:05.470
You treat your kids like
shit,maybe they pull a menendez

39:05.554 --> 39:09.141
and blow your brains out on the
goddamn couch while you're takin' a nap.

39:09.600 --> 39:14.354
But you,you seem to
do whatever you want,

39:14.396 --> 39:18.615
and nothin'- nothin'
bad ever happens.

39:18.650 --> 39:23.530
Everybody around you gets
killed or crushed or burnt up,

39:23.655 --> 39:28.535
but you,somehow you
always seem to survive.

39:29.119 --> 39:31.580
Well,not no more,big nose.

39:35.250 --> 39:39.588
You took the best thing I
ever had away from me,asshole.

39:39.922 --> 39:45.677
A brave man dies once,but a
coward dies a thousand times.

39:46.178 --> 39:49.264
Bet you wish you were
chickenshit now,huh,asshole?

39:55.812 --> 39:57.940
Have some ginger ale,boys.

39:58.357 --> 40:00.651
Hopefully this is gonna take a while.

40:17.543 --> 40:19.253
It's ok,cuz.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.755
You'll see when you get here.

40:21.839 --> 40:25.050
All makes sense on the other side.
