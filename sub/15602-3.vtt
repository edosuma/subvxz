~ Previously on Green Lantern ~

00:08.747 --> 00:10.310
For the greater good...

00:10.921 --> 00:12.198
...and vengeance!

00:15.232 --> 00:17.929
I'm the one responsible
for all this death and destruction!

00:18.206 --> 00:20.717
Which is why you're going to help
make up for it.

00:24.338 --> 00:27.834

00:31.696 --> 00:33.556
You like looking at that stuff,
Poozer?

00:33.650 --> 00:35.047
You proud of what you did?

00:37.134 --> 00:39.032
How many of you Red Lanterns
are out there?

00:39.611 --> 00:40.959
And why are you hunting
Green Lanterns?

00:43.046 --> 00:44.176
Answer me!

00:44.182 --> 00:46.846
Easy there, Kilowog!
This thing's a rental, remember?

00:53.499 --> 00:55.307
The Red Lanterns abandoned you,
Razer.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.591
Left you for dead.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.393
I think that calls for a little payback,
don't you?

00:58.920 --> 01:00.902
Help us.
Tell us what you know.

01:01.336 --> 01:04.009
I do hate the Red Lanterns
for what they've made me.

01:04.339 --> 01:06.897
But that doesn't mean
I stopped hating Green Lanterns.

01:07.163 --> 01:09.550
It just means
I have more people to hate.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.091
<i>Hal Jordan stole the Interceptor.</i>

01:14.092 --> 01:17.147
<i>And you wish to reward him
by giving him command of it?</i>

01:17.381 --> 01:18.932
<i>Appa, we have no choice.</i>

01:19.111 --> 01:21.716
<i>They are our only line of defense
on the Frontier.</i>

01:22.086 --> 01:23.525
<i>Besides, at that distance,</i>

01:23.526 --> 01:26.581
<i>there's very little we can do
to punish Jordan, anyway.</i>

01:26.600 --> 01:28.108
<i>Then, we are of one mind.</i>

01:28.109 --> 01:31.786
<i>The crew of the Interceptor
is tasked with gathering intelligence</i>

01:31.787 --> 01:32.996
<i>on the Red Lantern threat</i>

01:32.997 --> 01:36.629
<i>and taking reasonable action
to slow their advance.</i>

01:36.796 --> 01:38.481
<i>We may be of one mind,</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.089
<i>but only on the protest.</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:42.769
<i>Now. What is the status
of the Red Lantern's Ring?</i>

01:43.016 --> 01:45.266
Safe.
In a stasis box.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.338
Yeah, the Ring doesn't take
that much room.

01:48.573 --> 01:50.406
Unfortunately, Razer does.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.325
What do you suggest
we do with him?

01:52.667 --> 01:54.869
<i>Even you know your duty,
Hal Jordan.</i>

01:55.311 --> 01:56.722
<i>He must be imprisoned.</i>

01:58.974 --> 02:02.551
Fools! For what I have done,
they should execute me.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.246
<i>I do not understand
your desire for self-destruction.</i>

02:06.521 --> 02:08.056
<i>If one regrets one's actions,</i>

02:08.056 --> 02:10.201
<i>one should find a way
to make restitution.</i>

02:10.336 --> 02:12.595
I'm not about to debate this
with a computer!

02:14.017 --> 02:16.450
- Any orders?
- Yeah, find me a prison.

02:16.736 --> 02:20.035
It's not like we can just drop Razer off
on a handy Lantern science cell.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.961
<i>Frontier Lanterns
use privatized penitentiaries.</i>

02:23.007 --> 02:25.912
<i>- I can compile all the detailed places...</i>
- That won't be necessary, Aya.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.826
- Just something nearby.
- But nothing too nice.

02:47.596 --> 02:50.814
Wow, she really took you at your word
about the "nothing too nice" thing.

02:50.912 --> 02:52.157
It ain't that bad...

02:52.234 --> 02:54.518
Are you kidding?
This place gives me the creeps.

02:55.577 --> 02:58.514
It's like fear radiates
from the walls.

02:59.034 --> 03:01.316
It's a dark dang repulsive hall
full of...

03:01.317 --> 03:02.579
Spiders!

03:02.657 --> 03:04.443
I was gonna say "rats", but...

03:04.611 --> 03:05.771
Oh...

03:09.580 --> 03:12.205
Well, well...
Green Lanterns!

03:12.290 --> 03:14.894
It's been a long time since
we hosted a prisoner

03:14.895 --> 03:17.778
for our esteemed
colleagues in justice.

03:17.794 --> 03:19.161
I take it you're the warden?

03:19.491 --> 03:22.908
I am Myglom. I operate this prison
on behalf of the Spider Guild.

03:24.049 --> 03:27.148
Aah... it appears
you have something for me.

03:27.321 --> 03:29.181
This piece of work is Razer.

03:29.266 --> 03:32.353
We have documented evidence
of his crimes against sentient...

03:32.366 --> 03:35.172
Oh, I'm quite confident
he's guilty.

03:35.525 --> 03:38.313
No one has ever escaped
from this facility.

03:38.515 --> 03:40.250
I'm very proud of that...

03:40.277 --> 03:43.690
But I'm even more proud
of our rehabilitation program.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.661
You'll find that nearly 100%
of our former... guests

03:47.674 --> 03:50.499
never returned to a life of crime.

03:50.575 --> 03:52.004
Well, I'm sold!

03:52.005 --> 03:55.667
Myglom, we hereby officially
remand custody of Razer to your care.

03:58.393 --> 03:59.989
That's one Red Lantern down...

04:00.030 --> 04:01.627
More where that came from...

04:15.080 --> 04:17.175
Make yourself comfortable,
prisoner...

04:17.606 --> 04:20.846
I doubt very much
that these machines will be able to...

04:21.144 --> 04:22.685
...rehabilitate me.

04:22.772 --> 04:24.598
Oh, don't be concerned
with any of these.

04:24.986 --> 04:27.757
Soon you'll find yourself far...

04:27.758 --> 04:29.086
...far away.

04:34.865 --> 04:36.313
I don't know about you,

04:36.314 --> 04:39.290
but I'm gonna sleep a whole lot easier
knowing that guy ain't on board.

04:39.486 --> 04:41.745
Now we can get back
to nailing those Red...

04:42.966 --> 04:44.274
...Lanterns.

04:44.477 --> 04:46.318
- Did you see that?
- What?

04:46.704 --> 04:48.869
Out the window?
In space...?

04:50.779 --> 04:52.641
There!
Right there!

04:52.949 --> 04:54.156
Right where?

04:54.496 --> 04:56.975
I am not crazy!
I saw something there!

05:02.187 --> 05:03.520
What is up with you?

05:08.220 --> 05:10.743
Fan out.
Our hitchhiker's hiding somewhere.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.921
Will you stay out of my way?

05:34.973 --> 05:36.766
We're going about this all wrong!

05:36.767 --> 05:38.330
Whatever it is, it's intelligent.

05:38.331 --> 05:40.292
It's watching us
and staying one step ahead.

05:40.293 --> 05:43.037
- Why are you yelling at me?
- To cause a distraction,

05:43.038 --> 05:44.331
so I can do this!

06:00.191 --> 06:02.039
OK, squid, start talking.

06:02.075 --> 06:05.066
Kilowog here loves seafood
and has a big appetite.

06:05.070 --> 06:07.600
- What? - It's an old
interrogation method from Earth.

06:07.794 --> 06:09.215
Good cop, hungry cop.

06:09.530 --> 06:12.464
Goggan will not go back!
Cannot go back!

06:13.129 --> 06:16.678
Destroy me, but do not take me
back to the grim rock!

06:16.911 --> 06:19.012
To live all days like my worst!

06:19.264 --> 06:21.502
Wait... ugly and nuts!

06:21.551 --> 06:23.935
You escaped
from the Spider Guild's prison.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.541
Yes... with this!

06:26.624 --> 06:29.110
Goggan tunneled...
twelve years!

06:29.806 --> 06:32.037
Me sane, saneeee!

06:32.038 --> 06:34.692
Goggan rid the airshaft.
Then you!

06:34.693 --> 06:36.547
Still sane...

06:36.620 --> 06:38.188
You shouldn't have bothered,
nut job!

06:38.241 --> 06:40.924
Cause you're just going right back
to prison, where you belong!

06:40.935 --> 06:43.079
No...
Please, no!

06:43.367 --> 06:46.638
Mercy!
Not back to nightmare rock!

06:46.912 --> 06:48.794
Goggan lives his pain there.

06:49.115 --> 06:50.383
Torture...

06:50.384 --> 06:52.340
Goggan is a child there,
and old.

06:52.341 --> 06:54.238
The worst of fates!

06:54.239 --> 06:56.936
Again... and again...

06:56.993 --> 06:59.087
What? The escaped con
would say anything

06:59.088 --> 07:00.399
to stay out of prison!

07:00.460 --> 07:03.428
- And if he's telling the truth?
- Razer's worse than a criminal.

07:03.468 --> 07:05.569
If the spiders wanna
torture him, let 'em!

07:05.612 --> 07:08.476
It's our job, our duty
to serve and protect.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.281
Even if they're criminals.

07:10.294 --> 07:12.921
<i>Intriguing!
The criminals must be punished.</i>

07:13.174 --> 07:15.312
<i>Surely prisoners deserve their fate.</i>

07:15.468 --> 07:18.397
They deserve justice, which
sometimes involves punishment.

07:18.485 --> 07:19.732
But not torture.

07:20.031 --> 07:23.073
Look... We've got to take...
this back, anyway, so...

07:23.205 --> 07:24.916
We'll have a look around.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.256
OK. But even if there is
something wrong with the prison,

07:28.354 --> 07:30.450
it's not like Myglom's
gonna let us see it!

07:30.501 --> 07:32.554
They'll clean up their act
as soon as they'll see us coming!

07:32.614 --> 07:34.869
That's why they're not going
to see us coming.

07:35.062 --> 07:36.799
Please, don't say it...

07:36.954 --> 07:39.185
We're going to break
in to prison.

08:03.137 --> 08:04.623
It's worse than death!

08:04.906 --> 08:06.708
Infinity upon infinity...

08:06.751 --> 08:08.006
You mustnât go!

08:08.227 --> 08:10.776
Don't worry, Goggan,
just taking a quick look around.

08:10.787 --> 08:12.135
Dinner's in two hours.

08:12.249 --> 08:15.027
If we're not back, start without us,
because we're probably dead.

08:28.150 --> 08:29.545
We really doin' this?

08:30.020 --> 08:31.264
Really?

08:45.396 --> 08:46.707
The fighting is stopped.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.721
For now.
They'll be back.

08:48.849 --> 08:50.458
The warlords always come back.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.512
Maybe someday
they'll leave us alone.

08:52.874 --> 08:55.879
The Forgotten Zone will be a place
where we can raise a family...

08:56.725 --> 08:57.985
Without worry...

08:58.888 --> 09:00.157
Without fear...

09:02.755 --> 09:04.315
I'm going to help
make that happen.

09:04.817 --> 09:06.034
By joining the Militia.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.460
Razer, no!

09:07.487 --> 09:08.717
Please, no!

09:08.907 --> 09:11.644
I'm sick of hiding,
while the warlords take what they want.

09:12.002 --> 09:13.457
You think more fighting will help?

09:13.631 --> 09:16.606
Our people need teachers
and doctors and builders.

09:16.897 --> 09:18.200
Not more soldiers!

09:18.428 --> 09:19.915
I'll gain power in the Militia

09:19.993 --> 09:21.429
and protect everyone.

09:22.868 --> 09:25.302
Especially the ones
I care about most.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.188
We should check out
the accommodations.

09:44.683 --> 09:46.020
Well, there's no view...

09:46.577 --> 09:48.159
But there's clearly entertainment.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.226
For the guards, anyway.

09:50.603 --> 09:52.149
We don't know that stuff's for torture!

09:52.440 --> 09:55.068
This could be the rehabilitation
that Myglom talked about.

09:55.239 --> 09:58.911
Whoever was being rehabilitated here
was scratching desperately to escape.

10:00.358 --> 10:02.447
These yellow stones are everywhere.

10:03.079 --> 10:04.852
They make my skin crawl.

10:05.219 --> 10:06.869
I've never seen you scared before.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.911
I ain't scared of no rocks!

10:10.092 --> 10:11.400
Let's get out of here.

10:19.273 --> 10:22.361
I'm almost 90% sure
I remembered to charge it this time!

10:39.555 --> 10:40.695
Ilana!

10:50.193 --> 10:51.349
But...

10:51.360 --> 10:52.856
I came back for you...

10:53.841 --> 10:55.070
I came back!

10:58.315 --> 10:59.805
I came back for you...

11:05.885 --> 11:07.271
Rings are still down.

11:07.332 --> 11:08.677
It makes no sense.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.893
They're charged, but the only thing
working is the universal translator!

11:12.089 --> 11:13.461
Something's interfering with them.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.530
My Green Lantern friends...

11:16.486 --> 11:18.883
I'm shocked,
shocked to find you

11:18.884 --> 11:20.816
in this untoward position.

11:21.042 --> 11:22.314
Well, then cut us down.

11:22.338 --> 11:23.956
I'm afraid not.

11:24.297 --> 11:27.339
Now that you've seen our...
humane cells.

11:29.649 --> 11:31.713
Oh, your Rings won't work here.

11:32.518 --> 11:34.872
You must have noticed
this unusual mineral, hm?

11:35.070 --> 11:37.581
We stumbled upon
a rich vein of it nearby.

11:38.202 --> 11:40.407
Not only does it
power and light the facility,

11:40.408 --> 11:42.211
it has an interesting side effect.

11:42.650 --> 11:45.161
It nullifies the energy

11:45.162 --> 11:47.637
of a Green Lantern Power Ring.

11:47.717 --> 11:49.990
So you do run a gulag,
after all.

11:50.249 --> 11:51.601
Not at all...

11:52.238 --> 11:53.851
We don't torture
the prisoners here!

11:54.261 --> 11:56.569
Not in the...
traditional sense.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.952
These devices

12:06.953 --> 12:08.490
force the wearer to relive

12:08.491 --> 12:09.985
their worst moments

12:09.986 --> 12:11.523
again and again.

12:11.729 --> 12:14.001
So, that's what you got
in store for us?

12:14.381 --> 12:15.928
A couple of bad dreams?

12:16.208 --> 12:17.730
Oh, no, no...

12:18.029 --> 12:19.715
The memories
are only the beginning!

12:20.333 --> 12:21.977
After we treat our prisoners...

12:22.340 --> 12:24.233
Then, we eat them.

12:41.676 --> 12:42.951
They're dead by now.

12:42.952 --> 12:45.084
We must leave, leave,
before we're found!

12:45.288 --> 12:47.190
<i>Negative.
We will continue to wait.</i>

12:47.543 --> 12:49.581
The one said
he'd be back before dinner,

12:49.582 --> 12:50.978
two hours ago!

12:51.384 --> 12:52.769
Dinner time has past.
Dead!

12:53.031 --> 12:54.259
<i>There is a high probability</i>

12:54.260 --> 12:56.378
<i>that Hal was attempting
to be humorous.</i>

12:56.430 --> 12:58.675
If they're not dead yet,
they will be soon!

12:58.879 --> 13:00.428
Worse than dead, even!

13:02.089 --> 13:03.303
<i>Unacceptable.</i>

13:03.304 --> 13:05.758
<i>Action must be taken
to rescue the Green Lanterns.</i>

13:05.979 --> 13:07.386
<i>Even at risk to this unit.</i>

13:11.948 --> 13:13.166
Computer?

13:38.548 --> 13:39.660
But...

13:39.727 --> 13:41.140
But I came back for you.

13:41.311 --> 13:42.607
I came back!

13:43.752 --> 13:45.241
I came back for you...

13:46.962 --> 13:49.593
I came back for you!

13:52.208 --> 13:54.514
<i>Razer,
of The Forgotten Zone</i>

13:55.124 --> 13:58.175
<i>You have great rage
in your heart.</i>

13:59.733 --> 14:03.350
<i>You belong to
The Red Lantern Corps.</i>

14:03.732 --> 14:05.039
<i>Give in...</i>

14:05.272 --> 14:07.454
<i>The Ring knows your pain...</i>

14:09.329 --> 14:11.127
Someone must pay!

14:14.924 --> 14:17.089
<i>You'll have your revenge...</i>

14:17.142 --> 14:18.344
<i>This,</i>

14:18.345 --> 14:20.813
<i>your new Master,
Atrocitous,</i>

14:20.814 --> 14:22.664
<i>promises.</i>

14:50.282 --> 14:52.002
Razer, listen to me.

14:52.293 --> 14:53.779
None of this is real.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.952
This is not really happening.

14:56.334 --> 14:59.132
Do not panic.
I am the Aya program.

15:03.262 --> 15:05.010
I know this is a fantasy.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.568
An illusion,
meant to bring me pain.

15:07.686 --> 15:09.034
You know...
Then, why...?

15:09.341 --> 15:12.323
The memories keep replaying,
over and over, in my head.

15:12.644 --> 15:13.778
They hurt.

15:13.878 --> 15:15.121
But I don't mind.

15:15.579 --> 15:16.891
I get to see her again.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.139
Even if
it's for one more moment.

15:19.467 --> 15:20.906
I do not understand.

15:21.701 --> 15:23.317
Pray you never do.

15:23.446 --> 15:24.646
I need your help.

15:24.827 --> 15:27.232
I cannot save Hal and Kilowog
without you.

15:27.637 --> 15:29.843
Some force is keeping me
out of the prison.

15:30.194 --> 15:31.524
The prison?

15:31.652 --> 15:33.637
What are the Green Lanterns
even doing here?

15:33.861 --> 15:36.002
They've heard the prisoners
are being tortured here.

15:36.161 --> 15:37.757
And Hal thought
it was unacceptable.

15:37.981 --> 15:39.720
They came back here
to investigate.

15:40.290 --> 15:42.222
And to save you,
if that was true.

15:42.406 --> 15:43.625
They shouldn't have done that.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.456
I deserve to be here.

15:45.747 --> 15:47.634
I helped destroy
an entire world.

15:47.702 --> 15:50.051
All those people died
because of me.

15:50.622 --> 15:52.682
No. Kilowog was able
to rescue the settlers

15:52.683 --> 15:54.962
before the world
was destroyed.

15:55.508 --> 15:57.688
What?
Then, I didn't...

15:58.094 --> 15:59.250
It doesn't matter.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.213
I'm still the one
who pressed the button.

16:01.349 --> 16:03.518
In my heart,
I'm guilty of murder.

16:03.957 --> 16:05.632
I'm going to stay here...

16:06.651 --> 16:08.313
What you want is irrelevant.

16:17.721 --> 16:19.628
I will never forgive this.

16:20.084 --> 16:22.485
<i>I have seen your past,
and know your pain.</i>

16:22.716 --> 16:24.278
No one knows my pain!

16:24.671 --> 16:26.363
Certainly, not a machine.

16:35.914 --> 16:37.152
Where, now?

16:37.183 --> 16:39.909
<i>Some force is preventing me
from exploring this direction.</i>

16:40.211 --> 16:42.557
<i>I believe this is where
they are keeping Hal and Kilowog.</i>

16:43.138 --> 16:44.322
And the other way?

16:44.444 --> 16:46.239
<i>That is the path
back to the ship.</i>

16:46.960 --> 16:48.212
No!

16:48.535 --> 16:49.946
<i>You cannot leave them
to die!</i>

16:55.527 --> 16:56.701
Enough!

16:56.789 --> 16:59.952
These two need
but little tenderizing.

17:00.301 --> 17:02.732
Green Lantern is best eaten...

17:02.733 --> 17:04.300
fresh.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.742
And what are you
supposed to be?

17:12.040 --> 17:14.086
I am Goggan.
Are we leaving?

17:42.612 --> 17:44.034
Great timing, kid!

18:05.609 --> 18:08.414
We just got our butt saved
by a Red Lantern.

18:08.513 --> 18:09.749
I noticed.

18:09.851 --> 18:11.135
We gonna stand for that?

18:11.144 --> 18:12.423
No!

18:17.635 --> 18:19.291
Oh, you want some,
Poozer?

18:20.950 --> 18:22.742
There's plenty for everybody!

18:31.431 --> 18:33.437
You weren't gonna leave
without saying "goodbye".

18:33.467 --> 18:36.292
No... You have it
all wrong, Green Lantern!

19:04.846 --> 19:07.754
I was kicking butt long before
I ever got this Ring.

19:07.934 --> 19:10.340
And I've been squashing bugs
even longer.

19:48.476 --> 19:51.150
Myglom and his guards,
in the jail cells.

19:51.162 --> 19:52.363
Like you wanted!

19:52.383 --> 19:54.419
The Guardians have dispatched
a new warden.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.043
He should arrive
in 18 months.

19:56.181 --> 19:57.601
In the meantime...

19:57.716 --> 19:59.727
I'm designating
a temporary warden.

20:00.194 --> 20:01.589
Congratulations, Goggan.

20:01.671 --> 20:04.288
I'm leaving the prison in your capable...
hand...

20:04.290 --> 20:05.441
...things.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.098
I trust you can free the prisoners
from their cocoons?

20:09.300 --> 20:11.230
Yes... yes!
Of course, I...

20:11.541 --> 20:15.154
No one will ever be tortured here
again!

20:15.288 --> 20:18.730
You know, for a second there, I thought
you were gonna make Razer the warden.

20:18.749 --> 20:22.671
Are you crazy? I couldn't possibly leave
a Red Lantern in charge of this place.

20:25.252 --> 20:26.754
Because
he's coming with us.

20:37.426 --> 20:39.536
You know how that thing
the Spiders used

20:39.537 --> 20:42.595
made you relive
your absolute worst moments?

20:42.612 --> 20:43.802
Yeah...?

20:44.466 --> 20:46.188
I got a new one.

20:51.586 --> 20:53.962
<i>You do not seem
to have recovered from your ordeal.</i>

20:54.948 --> 20:56.567
You have seen my past.

20:56.764 --> 20:58.033
It is private.

20:58.418 --> 21:01.478
<i>The intrusion was necessary
to ensure the crew's survival.</i>

21:01.653 --> 21:03.826
You are an artificial intelligence.

21:04.456 --> 21:06.768
But you risked your existence
to save them.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.047
A Green Lantern
would do no less.
