(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.471 --> 00:05.039
sexually based offenses

00:05.073 --> 00:06.507
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.376
In New York City,

00:08.409 --> 00:09.577
the dedicated detectives

00:09.610 --> 00:11.445
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.479 --> 00:13.214
are members
of an elite squad

00:13.247 --> 00:15.049
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.651
These are their stories.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.253
Who found her?

00:19.287 --> 00:21.389
One of our custodians
saw Pamela run out

00:21.422 --> 00:22.390
of an empty classroom.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.391
She say
what happened?

00:23.424 --> 00:24.525
She won't tell us.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.794
But whoever attacked her
ripped her clothes and hit her.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.362
Thanks.
How's she doing?

00:28.396 --> 00:29.497
(woman)
Vitals are stable.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.233
No apparent fractures,
but he did a number on her face.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.434
She may need
a few stitches.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.303
Pamela, my name is Olivia.
I'm a detective.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.370
Please, leave me alone.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.705
Who attacked you?

00:37.738 --> 00:39.607
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.774
I know
that you're scared.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.443
It was just an argument,
okay?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.145
Did he rape you?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
I said something
nasty to him.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.448
It's my fault.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.782
I'll ride with her.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.451
(man)
Detectives,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.286
custodian said a boy
was running down the hall

00:52.320 --> 00:53.687
just as Pamela
came out of the classroom.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.523
He say who it was?
Didn't see his face.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.790
But he was wearing
baseball team

00:56.824 --> 00:58.359
practice sweats.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.294
(man)
Come on, man.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.295
All right.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.498
Everybody line up
for batting team practice.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.100
Can I help you?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.268
Police.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.669
Any of your players
not show up today?

01:08.702 --> 01:10.271
No, they're all here.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.406
Fin...

01:12.440 --> 01:14.408
(Stabler)
Take a look
at his jersey.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.544
Is it all right
if we talk to your pitcher?

01:16.577 --> 01:19.347
L.T.!

01:19.380 --> 01:20.514
Front and center.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.117
Yes, sir.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.389
These police officers
need a couple seconds.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.391
What can I do
for you guys?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.327
Tell us how that got
on your shirt.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.531
Sure it's not
from beating the crap

01:37.565 --> 01:38.766
out of Pamela Sawyer?

01:44.572 --> 01:46.207
Get off me.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.575
My Dad's a cop.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.877
Get him up.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.445
What's his name?

01:51.479 --> 01:53.514
Pete Breslin.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.485
You're Luke.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.886
Yeah.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.289
You know him?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.857
His father was my radio
car partner.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.934
[mellow rock music]

02:13.967 --> 02:22.876
*

02:58.712 --> 03:00.614
Did you call my dad yet?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.616
Yeah, he's on his way.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.485
He's gonna kill me.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.554
Well, look,
you let me talk to him first.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.456
I've known him
a long time.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.692
Yeah, I sort of remember
you now.

03:11.725 --> 03:16.530
Hey, did I--did I
do something wrong?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.002
You beat up Pamela Sawyer.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.438
Did she say I did that?

03:24.472 --> 03:25.706
(Fin)
When we called you
on it,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.408
you threw a right hook
at me,

03:27.441 --> 03:28.409
almost knocked me on my ass.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.279
I don't remember.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.482
(Stabler)
What do you remember?

03:34.515 --> 03:37.318
Um, eighth period.
Calculus.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.953
The bell rings.
I get dressed for practice.

03:39.987 --> 03:44.758
(Fin)
Then what?

03:44.792 --> 03:49.497
And then I'm sitting alone
in the back of your car.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.469
Okay. Um...

03:55.503 --> 03:57.871
How did Pamela's blood
wind up on your shirt?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.510
I swear, I don't know.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.746
She does.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.881
Oh, my God.
Is she okay?

04:07.915 --> 04:08.949
Can I talk to her?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.818
No, you're going to sit,

04:10.851 --> 04:11.885
and we're gonna
sort this out.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.321
Hey, John.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.489
Sit with Luke here
for a few minutes, will you?

04:15.523 --> 04:17.625
(Munch)
Right.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.460
You should have a doctor
look at your head.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.728
I'm okay.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.062
You need a statement
from me?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.597
For what?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.433
61 on Luke
for taking a swing at you.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.900
When's the last time
you saw that kid?

04:26.934 --> 04:27.968
Five, six years ago.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.570
He ever been
in trouble before?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
I'll check,
but I doubt it.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.840
His old man
would've killed him.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.508
He's jammed up enough.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.878
I don't need to collar him
for hitting me.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.685
You might as well
stop asking

04:44.718 --> 04:46.654
because I'm not going
to change my mind.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.357
Okay. We have Luke Breslin.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.591
Luke's here?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.092
How'd you know?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.362
Your blood
is on his shirt.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.530
What's going to happen
to him?

04:56.564 --> 04:59.500
That's up to the Assistant
District Attorney.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.835
He's never done
anything like this.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.438
There must be something
wrong with him.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.039
Well, if you tell us
what he did,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.542
maybe we can help him.

05:16.550 --> 05:20.053
I stayed late at school
to work on a math project.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.889
I was on my way out,

05:21.922 --> 05:23.891
and Luke was running
down the hallway.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.660
He was all hyped up
and weird.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.062
He grabbed me and started
kissing me on the lips

05:29.096 --> 05:30.364
like we're going out.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.499
So what did you do?

05:31.532 --> 05:34.535
I pushed him away.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.670
He got really, really mad.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.374
Then he pulled me
into the classroom

05:40.408 --> 05:43.010
and ripped my shirt.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.580
I kicked him
and he hit me in the face.

05:46.614 --> 05:50.551
And then he just walked out.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.621
We're best friends,
but I don't know.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.589
Maybe I said
or did something

05:55.623 --> 05:57.891
to lead him on.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.092
He had no right

05:59.126 --> 06:00.594
to attack you, Pamela.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.095
And you need
to press charges.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.697
He'd be kicked
out of school.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.533
He wouldn't graduate.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.834
What's everybody
going to say

06:06.867 --> 06:08.602
if I do this to him?

06:08.636 --> 06:11.639
Pamela,
you can't protect him.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.574
[knock at door]

06:19.513 --> 06:21.048
Her parents are here.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.816
Detective Stabler

06:22.850 --> 06:24.818
will be handling
the investigation.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.654
Fin already
filled them in.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.921
Is Pamela okay?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.457
Well, she's a little
bruised up,

06:29.490 --> 06:30.591
had a couple stitches,

06:30.624 --> 06:32.493
but otherwise,
I think she's all right.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.127
Pamela's been friends
with him since second grade.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.496
He's always at our house.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.630
We're like
surrogate parents to him.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.131
How could he do this?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.534
Did--did you arrest him?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.436
We can't.
Pamela won't press charges.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.037
Well, then we will.
Well, it's her choice.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.039
The most we could
charge him with

06:46.073 --> 06:47.908
is misdemeanor assault.

06:47.941 --> 06:48.909
That's all?

06:48.942 --> 06:49.910
Yeah.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.579
It may not be worth it

06:51.612 --> 06:53.180
to make Pamela relive
what happened at trial.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.615
Hi, I'm Detective Benson.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.517
Pamela's right in there.
You can see her now.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.018
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.593
What the hell was that?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.661
I'm giving them
the facts.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.663
Luke Breslin assaulted
Pamela Sawyer.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.964
End of story.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.601
And I'm having a hard time
believing that.
Why?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.802
Because he's the son
of your ex-partner?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.604
Because he's got
some kind of memory loss.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.671
Oh, that's convenient.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.906
Elliot, if this was any
other kid,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.240
there'd be
no discussion.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.742
I left a message
for Huang.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.611
He's gonna come in
and talk to him.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.112
Since when do we call
the shrink

07:25.145 --> 07:26.480
before we make the collar?

07:26.514 --> 07:27.748
I just think
there's another explanation.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.816
"It may not be worth it

07:28.849 --> 07:30.083
to make Pamela relive
what happened"?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.485
Who are you kidding?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.820
You're trying to make this
go away.

07:32.853 --> 07:36.757
I've known Luke
since he was a baby.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.561
Always a sweet kid.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.795
Elliot, you haven't
seen him

07:41.829 --> 07:42.863
since before
he hit puberty.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.565
And he's not so sweet
anymore.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.166
Where are you going?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.101
To see if Pamela's parents
had any luck

07:48.135 --> 07:49.803
changing her mind.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.277
Pete!

07:57.310 --> 07:59.813
Elliot.

07:59.847 --> 08:00.948
Man, I'm lucky
you caught this.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.115
It's been a long time.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.283
So where's Luke?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.952
You didn't put him in
with the mutts.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.020
No, he hasn't been booked.
He's not in the system.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.689
He's in with another detective
right now.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.123
I tried to call Lily.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.792
Did she get another job
or something?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.193
Uh, Lily moved out
six years ago.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.796
Oh, I didn't know that.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.197
Where is she?

08:17.230 --> 08:18.666
Michigan.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.167
She don't call.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.536
Not even Luke.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.872
How's Kathy and the kids?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.841
Fine. They're all staying
with Kathy's mom.
Sorry.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.578
Occupational hazard,
right?

08:30.611 --> 08:31.745
So how bad is this
for Luke?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.581
Well, the detective
he slugged

08:33.614 --> 08:35.048
doesn't want
to collar him

08:35.082 --> 08:36.249
and the girl's not making
a complaint.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.852
You know, uh,

08:38.886 --> 08:40.721
Luke keeps saying that, uh,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.856
he doesn't remember
anything.

08:42.890 --> 08:43.957
You interrogated him

08:43.991 --> 08:45.125
without giving me
the courtesy

08:45.158 --> 08:46.727
of waiting
till I got here?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.897
I'm not trying to run a game
on your son. Come on.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.632
Let me talk to him.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.800
All right, look,
he's in there.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.636
Detective's name
is John Munch.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.137
Just tell him
who you are.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.774
Parents tried. No dice.
Pam's not talking.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.643
Well, there's not much
we can do

09:02.676 --> 09:03.777
without
a complaining witness.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.912
What evidence
have we got?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.980
Well, the tape of the call
to 9-1-1,

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
photos
of Pamela's injuries,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.251
and we will have her DNA
from the blood on Luke's shirt.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.620
(Novak)
That's plenty.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.788
We'll charge him
the same way

09:14.822 --> 09:15.789
as a batterer
whose wife cooperate.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.957
Prosecute him
without the victim.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.759
Pamela finds out
we can do it without her,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.761
maybe she'll change her mind,
give us a complaint.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.596
It's an awful lot of work
for a misdemeanor.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.797
(Benson)
She's lucky

09:23.831 --> 09:25.265
that he didn't kill her
or disfigure her.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.635
It shouldn't be
a misdemeanor.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.603
I'll put it
in motion.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.871
Get Luke

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
into the system now.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.815
Elliot,
I got your message.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.817
Thanks for coming in.
What do you think?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.819
Well, I have to talk
to him first.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.320
Yeah, of course.
How's it going?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.689
Swimmingly.
Everyone's behaving.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.757
Am I relieved?
Yeah.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.924
Anyone is looking,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.225
I'll be in the porcelain
reading room.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.927
Luke, Pete Breslin.
Dr. George Huang.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.195
He's a psychiatrist.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.730
(Breslin)
How you doing?

09:56.764 --> 09:59.166
Do you mind if I spend
a few moments with your son?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.367
No. If it'll help, sure.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.703
Come on, let's talk.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.981
Luke told me
the same thing.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.850
He doesn't remember.

10:16.884 --> 10:20.854
I'm worried about him.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.190
Pete, I gotta ask you
something.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.895
Luke ever have a problem
with drugs?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.397
He's a straight-A student.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.232
He's got a 98
mile an hour fastball,

10:32.265 --> 10:33.767
and he hits home runs.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.235
And everybody loves him.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.705
Sound like a kid
on drugs to you?

10:37.738 --> 10:42.009
I gotta collar him.
Captain's orders.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.047
He's got colleges.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.882
Scouts from the minors
and majors looking at him.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.885
We both know he's not going
to be doing any time on this.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
He gets popped,

10:53.921 --> 10:55.823
he's got to report it
to every school, every team.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.825
His life is over
before it even started.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.459
Pete, he punched a girl.
Three times.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.729
This is serious.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.833
Call a lawyer.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.202
You're not
gonna do anything?

11:13.974 --> 11:17.010
I heard what those cops did
for your daughter on a DUI.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.445
My daughter
didn't hurt anyone.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.981
She could've killed
someone.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.983
And then I'd be
in the same boat as you

11:23.016 --> 11:24.985
doing exactly what
I'm telling you to do.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.686
Call a lawyer.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.458
Used to give a guy
a break.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.994
Pete, go home.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.295
Luke's going through
the system.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.431
I can't do anything
about it.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.940
What are you doing?

11:46.974 --> 11:49.910
You told the Sawyers
that Pamela's better off

11:49.943 --> 11:50.911
not making a complaint.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.245
Olivia tell you that?

11:52.279 --> 11:55.415
No, Pamela's parents.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.085
This is worse than breaking
the rules this time.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.788
You put the entire squad's
credibility on the line.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.055
Captain--

12:02.089 --> 12:03.356
You did everything
you could

12:03.390 --> 12:05.325
to get your ex-partner's
kid a pass.
Captain--

12:05.358 --> 12:08.395
As of right this minute
you are on vacation.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.964
Just get your ass
out of my sight

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
before I do something
we both regret.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.142
I don't understand it.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.277
I've never punched anyone
my entire life.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.813
You know, my Dad,

12:25.846 --> 12:27.280
he taught me to hit back

12:27.314 --> 12:28.782
if somebody were
to swing at me first.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.052
But Pamela wouldn't hit me
and I'm stronger than her.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
Luke, are you okay?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.223
Yeah, why?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.791
You seem anxious.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.359
Well, I'm sitting
in a police station

12:39.392 --> 12:40.861
and I'm talking to a shrink

12:40.894 --> 12:42.029
about how I don't remember

12:42.062 --> 12:43.530
ripping my best friend's
clothes off

12:43.563 --> 12:45.065
and slugging her
and a cop.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.434
Yes, I'm--I'm a little
stressed out.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.269
Okay, besides
what happened today,

12:49.302 --> 12:51.104
have you been feeling
stressed out lately?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.806
Not really.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.341
You got a lot
on your plate

12:54.374 --> 12:55.508
juggling baseball
and studying.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.509
That's not a big deal.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.545
How are things going
at school?
Good.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.580
Your grades.
I have a 3.8 GPA.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.484
How do you manage that
when you're playing baseball?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.419
I don't know.
I stay up late.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.289
How late?
All night if I have to.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.024
Do you have a lot of energy?

13:11.058 --> 13:12.893
Yeah.
Most of the time.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.865
Do you ever have
a bad day?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.200
Everybody does.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.202
Like when?

13:22.235 --> 13:23.871
Sometimes I wake up
feeling so down

13:23.904 --> 13:27.074
I can barely get out
of bed.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.209
Wait.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.879
Why--why--why are you
trying to confuse me?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.580
I'm not trying
to confuse you.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.115
Everything's great.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.616
School's great.
Baseball's great.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.619
I have no idea why I punched
Pamela or the cop,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.621
but I'm sorry, okay?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.558
I'm sorry.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.560
No way stress made Luke
go off like he did.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.930
Well, his father agreed
to have him tested for drugs.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.932
I don't think
that's what's wrong with him.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.100
What is?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.267
During the interview,

13:54.301 --> 13:55.435
he was talking fast

13:55.468 --> 13:57.104
and he described periods
of intense energy

13:57.137 --> 13:58.438
and severe depression.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.572
You think he's bipolar.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.174
He's 17.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.043
He's the right age
for the onset of symptoms.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.444
But what about his attack
on Pamela?

14:04.477 --> 14:06.947
Rage brought on
by a manic state.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.949
What Luke did to Pamela
was horrible.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.584
But if he is bipolar,
he needs to be on medication.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.186
Thanks, Doc.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.189
I see a psych defense coming
a mile away.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.524
Before Novak arraigns Luke,

14:17.557 --> 14:18.491
she's got to know

14:18.525 --> 14:20.660
if he has a history
of blowing his stack.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.329
Let's talk to his friends.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.531
Start with Pamela.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.969
(Pamela)
I've never seen Luke
get mad--ever.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.437
Even when he should.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.640
Why should he be mad?

14:33.673 --> 14:37.510
His father.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.611
Why?

14:38.645 --> 14:44.251
Because nothing Luke does
is ever good enough for him.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.919
Well, he bragged
about Luke to my partner.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.921
Yeah, but when Luke
gets an A on a test,

14:47.955 --> 14:49.957
his father says
it should've been an A-plus.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.092
First game of the season,
Luke pitches a two-hitter.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
His father says
it could've been a no-hitter.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.529
And after Luke
had this operation,

14:56.563 --> 14:59.466
the doctor said that if
he didn't stop playing

14:59.499 --> 15:02.002
all year 'round,
he'd never pitch again.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.437
How did his father react?

15:04.471 --> 15:07.207
He blamed Luke.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.541
Said it wouldn't
have happened

15:08.575 --> 15:09.709
if he worked out more.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.981
And then he gave Luke money
to join a gym.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.983
Sure, I know Luke.
Joined just before summer.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.118
Worked out like a fiend
until last week.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.152
You train him?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.653
I spotted him a few times.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.289
Luke doesn't need
a trainer.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.024
You ever see him
have problems with anyone?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.658
He got into it
with one of the members.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.360
Thought the guy
was taking too long

15:27.394 --> 15:28.695
on the bench press.
They fight?

15:28.728 --> 15:31.031
Luke slugged the guy.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.500
Went to hit him again.
I jumped in. Broke it up.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.168
Haven't seen him since.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.970
Okay. If you think
of anything else,

15:37.004 --> 15:38.438
give me a call.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.174
Uh, he's got a locker.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.643
I was gonna box up
his stuff.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.118
Sneakers. Socks.
Shorts.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.054
What the hell
is this?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.056
Oh, no.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.726
(Fin)
Deca, Depo, Andro.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.728
Luke's on steroids,
and he's stacking.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.730
You running
a juice bar here, buster?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.432
That stuff
will give you pimples

16:05.465 --> 16:06.599
and shrink your balls.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.435
I swear I don't know
where it came from.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.037
You better not
be lying to me.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.304
Look, I'll cooperate
any way I can.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.706
Somebody's selling that stuff
in my gym, I want them busted.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.709
You let us
put a undercover in here?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.745
I put in the undercover
request to narcotics.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.646
They laughed.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.514
They find something funny
about this?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.350
It's not a priority
in the department.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.684
Nobody
who abuses steroids

16:24.717 --> 16:26.353
is out robbing
and killing people

16:26.386 --> 16:27.620
to get buy money.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.089
Yeah, they're usually Captain

16:29.122 --> 16:30.490
of the high school
baseball team.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.325
So Luke could've been
in a 'roid rage

16:32.359 --> 16:33.593
when he attacked Pamela.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.627
Absolutely.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.762
The symptoms are
indistinguishable

16:35.795 --> 16:37.297
from bipolar disorder.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.232
Luke's rage was caused
by too much testosterone.

16:39.266 --> 16:42.369
(Munch)
And the depression?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.703
Prolonged use of steroids

16:43.736 --> 16:45.172
shuts down your natural
production of testosterone.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.339
Stop taking them,

16:46.373 --> 16:47.740
you go into
a severe depression

16:47.774 --> 16:48.608
until your hormones
start flowing again.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.310
Pamela's lucky
he didn't go further.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.112
Very lucky.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.047
I once saw a guy
in a 'roid rage

16:54.081 --> 16:56.216
open a steel door
by ripping it off its hinges

16:56.249 --> 16:57.550
and throwing it.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.152
Took two shotgun blasts
to stop him.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.687
Like someone on PCP
thinks they're Superman.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.522
(Benson)
So Luke wants to make
his dad proud.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.193
Goes for a quick fix
so he can bulk up fast.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.360
And why shouldn't he

17:07.394 --> 17:09.062
when his role models
in the majors

17:09.096 --> 17:10.397
are breaking records
using this stuff?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.232
And Congress lets kids
buy it over the counter.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.067
A certain senator
made a little backroom deal

17:14.101 --> 17:17.370
with the supplement industry
to keep DHEA on the market.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.506
They're not sending
a very good message, are they?

17:19.539 --> 17:20.640
(Benson)
So you're sure that Luke

17:20.673 --> 17:23.610
didn't know what he was doing
when he attacked Pamela.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.278
With no previous history
of violent behavior,

17:25.312 --> 17:27.714
it's likely the steroids
made him do it.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.292
You going to invite me in?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.128
I don't want to talk
about it, though.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.096
You sound
like Pamela Sawyer.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.297
And that's not why
I'm here.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.832
Well, why are you here?

17:45.865 --> 17:49.236
Came to apologize.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.837
You were right
about Luke Breslin.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.339
He's been juicing up
on steroids

17:52.372 --> 17:54.141
for the last six months.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.143
Pamela says it's because
of the pressure

17:56.176 --> 17:57.844
that his father's
been putting on him.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.850
His father know
about the drug?

18:03.883 --> 18:05.852
No, Luke begged us
not to tell him.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.354
Someone's got to.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.456
Don't do it.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.392
Calling Breslin is
only going to make it worse.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.765
He's going to court
tomorrow.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.601
Arraignment's first thing
in the morning.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.143
(court clerk)
Docket ending.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.279
497. People versus
Luke Thomas Breslin.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.814
One count assault
in the third degree.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.816
One count criminal possession
of a controlled substance

18:36.849 --> 18:37.917
in the third degree.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.787
What are you talking about?
My kid's not on drugs.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.490
(judge)
I will have it quiet

18:43.523 --> 18:45.792
or you will be
ejected, sir.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.927
How does the defendant plead?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.796
Not guilty.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.531
(judge)
I'll hear the People.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.865
The defendant assaulted
a classmate

18:52.899 --> 18:54.201
and the beating
required stitches.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.802
The police found
three different types

18:55.835 --> 18:58.571
of anabolic steroids
in his gym locker.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.240
Your Honor, my client
has no previous history

19:00.273 --> 19:01.174
of violence or drug use.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.276
No arrest record
and is not a flight risk.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.611
His father
is a police officer

19:04.644 --> 19:05.945
with NYPD.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.847
We're requesting
ROR release

19:07.880 --> 19:09.182
to his custody.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.183
Ms. Novak?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.584
The People
have no objection.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.819
(judge)
The defendant is released

19:12.852 --> 19:13.853
on his own recognizance

19:13.886 --> 19:15.922
into the custody
of his father pending trial.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.290
Take ten.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.625
[bangs gavel]

19:39.379 --> 19:41.314
[shouting]

19:43.015 --> 19:43.950
What's going on in there?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.318
Guy's beating up
some kid.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.954
I'm a cop.
Go get help.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.422
(Breslin)
You're a failure!

19:49.456 --> 19:51.391
You can't be a man
without drugs.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.792
Now the whole world
has to hear--

19:52.825 --> 19:53.960
Pete, get off.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.728
Stay out of this!

19:58.365 --> 19:59.832
Pete, get off of him.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.235
[grunts]

20:02.269 --> 20:03.303
[glass shatters]

20:03.336 --> 20:04.771
You've done
enough damage!

20:04.804 --> 20:06.839
You stupid, stinking,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.376
sorry piece of crap.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.877
You're a screw-up,
a failure!

20:12.579 --> 20:15.248
Who's the failure,
you son of a bitch?

20:24.023 --> 20:26.493
You want some damage?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.994
I'll show you some damage.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.362
Hey! Hey!

20:29.396 --> 20:30.797
Stand down.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.964
Stand down.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.033
Let me go. I'm a cop.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.635
Hey, it wasn't him.
It wasn't him.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.670
The one on the floor
was hitting the kid.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.886
(Benson)
Elliot.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.322
Leave me alone.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.325
(Benson)
What happened?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.828
I don't know.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.503
(Hendrix)
Yeah?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.805
Doc.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.408
Come in.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.717
(Hendrix)
Tell me what happened.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.653
I just beat the hell
out of a guy.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.888
Was he threatening you?

21:28.921 --> 21:32.325
His son.
He was hitting his son.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.494
One second he's got his kid
up against a wall,

21:34.527 --> 21:39.666
and the next...
I was...

21:39.699 --> 21:43.470
I was busting his face
wide open.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.872
That's it?

21:45.905 --> 21:48.575
Can you remember
anything else?

21:51.511 --> 21:54.647
Looking in the mirror.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.016
What did you see?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.386
What difference
does that make?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.058
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.427
What's wrong with me?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.096
Why did you come here?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.668
I had no place else
to go.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.541
My Captain sent me home.
I'm lucky he didn't suspend me.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.477
You didn't go home.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.446
What's the point?
No one's there.

22:30.517 --> 22:34.353
My wife left me last year.
She took the kids with her.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.658
Why did she leave?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.993
[Stabler laughs]

22:49.902 --> 22:54.407
She was tired of me
being angry all the time.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.808
[Stabler laughs]

22:55.842 --> 22:58.645
Did you ever talk
about it?

22:58.678 --> 23:00.613
Yeah, I went to a priest
for counseling.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.650
Next thing I know,
she wanted out.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.525
I did everything
that I was supposed to do.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.594
You know, I work hard,
I got a good job.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.962
I never cheated
on my wife.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.665
I've lost my kids.
I've lost my children.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.573
It wasn't supposed to happen
this way.

23:26.606 --> 23:30.677
But it did.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.814
What about
what happened today?

23:34.847 --> 23:36.449
Did that make you
feel better?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.122
What kind of question
is that?

23:43.155 --> 23:44.791
Are you judging me?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.493
I'm not judging you.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.695
Don't work me like a perp.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.633
I came here--

24:02.675 --> 24:04.043
This was a mistake.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.812
Where are you going?

24:07.146 --> 24:08.615
How many times
have you thought

24:08.648 --> 24:10.950
about eating
your gun?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.522
Suicide's a sin.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.124
So is divorce.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.073
How long have you been
at SVU?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.808
12 years.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.744
Average tour is two.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.579
I love my job.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.581
What do you love
about it?

24:41.614 --> 24:42.915
Getting justice
for the victims

24:42.949 --> 24:44.917
and the pervs
off the street.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.587
And I'm not burned out.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.089
Were you burned out
on your marriage?

24:50.122 --> 24:52.091
I told you she bailed,

24:52.124 --> 24:53.125
not me.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.264
If you want to cut me loose,

24:58.297 --> 25:01.668
you know, give me a clue.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.903
Did your Captain
give you a clue

25:03.936 --> 25:05.972
before he cut you loose?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.306
Only about a million times.

25:07.339 --> 25:11.310
I just, uh, always blow it.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.945
What can I tell you?

25:12.979 --> 25:15.548
I, uh, don't like
being ordered around.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.683
You don't like
being ordered around?

25:16.716 --> 25:17.917
Why'd you become
a cop?

25:20.587 --> 25:22.188
My father was on the job.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.023
He must be proud of you.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.292
He's dead.

25:26.325 --> 25:30.296
Did he want you to go
into the family business?

25:34.033 --> 25:37.604
Kathy was pregnant.
I needed the money.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.740
Was it what you wanted?

25:42.675 --> 25:45.712
What, to be a cop?
All my life.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.279
Then why
wasn't your father proud?

25:47.313 --> 25:48.815
I never said that.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.116
You never answered
the question.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.751
You're putting words
in my mouth.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.853
Don't put words in my mouth.
I don't like it.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.991
Did your father like
being a cop?

25:59.025 --> 26:01.628
Yeah, until the job
screwed him. Yeah.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.763
Screwed him? How?

26:03.796 --> 26:05.732
It forced him to rat out
his friends

26:05.765 --> 26:06.666
to the Knapp Commission.

26:06.699 --> 26:10.269
So your father was isolated
as a snitch?

26:10.302 --> 26:12.939
My father was no rat.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.074
He never testified.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.776
I'm surprised
he had a choice.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.845
He didn't. They fired him.
And he lost his pension.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.883
How did he take that?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.152
Like it was the end
of the world.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.854
And I'm not him.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.722
I never said you were.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.924
Why all these questions?

26:31.958 --> 26:34.961
I have to know you
to help you.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.683
What was your relationship
like with your dad?

26:56.716 --> 26:59.085
What did you used
to do together?

26:59.118 --> 27:02.722
Watch TV. Play ball.
Go fishing.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.224
Anything else?

27:05.257 --> 27:06.726
Like what?

27:06.759 --> 27:08.761
You tell me.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.734
He worked 4:00 to 12:00,

27:14.767 --> 27:16.803
so we didn't spend
a lot of time together.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.905
He never helped you
with your homework?

27:18.938 --> 27:22.809
Once when I was
in fifth grade.

27:27.413 --> 27:32.084
I had to make this diorama.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.786
Do you remember those things?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.187
The models that you put
in shoe boxes?

27:35.221 --> 27:36.989
Sure.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.891
It was about the Civil War.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.894
And he told me
where to put the cannons

27:41.928 --> 27:45.131
and the soldiers
and the trees.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.470
Never forget it.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.840
Did you get a good grade?

27:56.308 --> 27:57.777
What?

27:57.810 --> 27:59.245
Did you get a good grade?

27:59.278 --> 28:00.713
What difference
does that make?

28:00.747 --> 28:02.982
It's just a question.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.722
I don't understand
what you want from me.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.961
The truth.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.764
I want you
to start talking.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.900
Really talking.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.807
What grade did you get
on the diorama?

28:27.840 --> 28:29.375
An F.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.077
You failed.

28:31.110 --> 28:34.180
I didn't hand it in.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.482
Why not?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.833
I moved one of the trees.

28:53.866 --> 28:59.005
And my father saw it
as I was leaving for school.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.340
He took it out of my hands,

29:01.373 --> 29:04.243
and he threw it on the ground
and he stomped on it.

29:14.887 --> 29:18.190
It must've really hurt
when he did that.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.964
He took off his belt
and he beat me with it.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.534
[holding back tears]

29:28.567 --> 29:32.538
Because I cried.

29:32.571 --> 29:38.210
And only pan-pansies...

29:38.244 --> 29:42.014
cry.

29:42.048 --> 29:45.384
[crying]

29:58.430 --> 30:01.067
He said I was weak.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.103
And called me a failure.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.508
Called me that a lot.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.984
What did you see
in that mirror today, Elliot?

30:31.063 --> 30:34.000
The guy my father
always saw.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.107
You're not weak.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.310
You're so busy being strong

30:44.343 --> 30:46.312
and helping everyone,

30:46.345 --> 30:50.082
you've got nothing left
for yourself.

30:56.022 --> 30:59.325
It takes a lot more balls
to talk about your problems

30:59.358 --> 31:04.931
than beat the hell
out of a ghost.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.104
Pete.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.472
Pete.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.408
Elliot.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.943
You hang in there.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.611
Hang in there.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.680
This is Detective Stabler.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.382
Shield 6313. 10:13.

31:56.415 --> 32:00.052
MOS shot, 202 Fieldston Avenue
in Riverdale.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.554
I need a bus now.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.493
Is he gonna make it?

32:07.526 --> 32:10.196
Won't know
till we get to the E.R.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.397
Hang on.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.432
I can't even get that right.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.634
What didn't
you get right, Pete?

32:15.667 --> 32:17.736
Blowing my brains out.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.405
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.572
Luke's a great kid.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.476
It's all my fault.
[monitor beeping]

32:24.510 --> 32:25.577
He's in cardiac arrest.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.346
Pete, wake up for me.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.314
Pete!

32:28.347 --> 32:29.581
You gotta wake up.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.716
Pete!
[monitor beeping normally]

32:30.749 --> 32:32.018
What happened?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.185
You left us
for a couple seconds.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.020
How you feeling?

32:34.053 --> 32:36.055
Like my chest
is going to explode.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.623
What now?

32:37.656 --> 32:38.657
Pulse is racing, 180.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.159
Why?
I don't know.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.327
Never seen this before.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.230
Pete, you gotta stay
with me.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.032
Pete? Pete!
Open your eyes.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.267
That's it.
We're almost there.

32:49.501 --> 32:54.073
(man)
Detective.

32:54.106 --> 32:57.376
Bullet lodged in his skull.
Never hit the brain.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.378
So he's going to recover?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.380
From the gunshot wound,
yes.

33:01.413 --> 33:05.184
But, uh, his heart,
well, that's another story.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.718
What's wrong
with his heart?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.387
He had a reaction
to the epinephrine

33:08.420 --> 33:09.488
the medics gave him.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.556
There was something else
in his system.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.091
Like what?

33:12.124 --> 33:14.026
My guess is steroids.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.694
Why would you say that?

33:15.727 --> 33:18.397
Blood work showed
his testosterone was elevated.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.531
Look, I'll keep you posted.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.533
Thanks, Doc.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.435
Elliot.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.603
Look, Captain--

33:24.636 --> 33:26.272
We got a call
from some lawyer

33:26.305 --> 33:28.174
who saw what happened
in the courthouse men's room.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.242
Said you beat up
on Pete Breslin to stop him

33:30.276 --> 33:31.610
from killing Luke.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.250
Look, how I handled
that Luke thing,

33:38.284 --> 33:40.119
you were right
to send me home.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.353
I was out of control.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.356
And I want you to know

33:44.390 --> 33:47.426
that I'm dealing with it.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.595
You have trouble
dealing with it,

33:49.628 --> 33:52.331
you come to my office
or you call me.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.300
I'd like to stay here

33:54.333 --> 33:57.469
and talk to Pete
when he wakes up.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.338
Okay.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.274
Doc says Pete's
been taking steroids.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.845
Munch and Fin
are at Breslin's house.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.580
I'll have them look
for the drugs.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.824
Hey.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.826
You want a kiss
for saving my life,

34:20.859 --> 34:22.261
you can forget about it.

34:22.294 --> 34:25.497
I'll settle for a hug.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.372
[clears throat]

34:33.405 --> 34:37.343
Pete, how long
have you been taking steroids?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.888
You remember that highway cop
last year on Staten Island?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.557
Perp took his gun
and shot him.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.559
Kenny Teachen. Sure.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.861
He was my next partner
after you.

34:55.894 --> 34:58.364
43 years old.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.400
He got soft
and got himself killed.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.402
I wasn't going to let that
happen to me.

35:03.435 --> 35:07.139
Taking the 'roids to keep
your edge on the street.

35:07.173 --> 35:11.377
You gonna tell my CO?

35:11.410 --> 35:15.514
Pete, Crime Scene
found your stash.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.284
There's no way
to keep that quiet.

35:20.886 --> 35:24.356
It was bound to happen anyway
after our fight.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.525
I knew I was going
to get fired,

35:26.558 --> 35:30.396
lose my pension.

35:30.429 --> 35:34.533
That's why I tried
to end it.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.472
Pete, don't lie to me.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.441
I'm not lying.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.444
Why are there powder burns
on the side of your head?

35:51.483 --> 35:54.553
Where's Luke?

35:56.888 --> 35:59.725
He's my son.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.831
[door opens]

36:05.864 --> 36:08.667
Elliot.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.639
Luke's fingerprint
is on the trigger

36:13.672 --> 36:15.307
of Breslin's .38.
You pick him up?

36:15.341 --> 36:17.309
Cragen wanted me to come here
and get you first.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.577
Luke may be armed.
With what?

36:18.610 --> 36:21.247
His father's duty weapon
is missing.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.481
We tore the house apart.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.482
Couldn't find it.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.650
I've already
called the school.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.652
Luke was absent today
and so was Pamela.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.322
[police siren]

36:30.356 --> 36:31.790
Benson, Stabler.
Manhattan Special Victims unit.

36:31.823 --> 36:32.958
What's going on?

36:32.991 --> 36:34.326
9-1-1 called
from this address.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.961
Someone inside
with a gun.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.597
You come with us.
You three, around back.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.735
[knock at door]

36:53.679 --> 36:54.980
[crying]

37:12.331 --> 37:14.300
(Luke)
Who's out there?

37:14.333 --> 37:16.335
Luke,
it's Elliot Stabler.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.670
Go away.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.671
I can't do that.

37:19.705 --> 37:23.809
Now, I'm gonna come in there
without my weapon.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.879
All right? Relax.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.556
Just leave me alone.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.925
Please, Luke,
don't do this.

37:44.596 --> 37:48.266
Pamela, come with me
so they can talk. Okay?

37:50.436 --> 37:53.405
I don't--I don't
want to talk anymore.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.873
And you don't have to.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.875
I actually came here
to apologize

37:56.908 --> 37:58.710
for what I did
to your father.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.581
Nothing compared
to what I did to him.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.451
What'd you do?

38:05.484 --> 38:09.788
After court,

38:09.821 --> 38:12.591
my aunt took me
to her house.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.394
But I wanted to talk
to Dad.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.831
So you went home.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.700
I walk in

38:21.733 --> 38:26.938
and he lays into me
about the steroids again.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.941
I said he can't make me
stop taking them

38:29.975 --> 38:33.812
if he's taking them
himself.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.817
How'd you find out?

38:38.850 --> 38:40.952
The juice I was taking,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.989
I stole it from his room.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.993
I told him that.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.061
He said I should get out.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.899
I was so mad.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.467
So I went,

38:55.501 --> 38:59.805
I grabbed his old gun,

38:59.838 --> 39:02.841
I came back
into the living room,

39:02.874 --> 39:06.978
and I said--I said,
"Dad, look at me."

39:07.012 --> 39:10.482
Look at me.

39:10.516 --> 39:14.486
But he wouldn't.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.456
And the next thing
I know,

39:17.489 --> 39:20.459
he's lying
on the floor bleeding.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.433
He was right.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.834
About what?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.502
I'm a failure.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.970
Luke, listen to me.
You're not a failure.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.672
I am.
I know you're scared

39:33.705 --> 39:35.974
and you may think
this is the only way out of it,

39:36.007 --> 39:37.142
but it's not.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.811
Luke, it's the steroids.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.813
When was the last time
you took them?

39:41.847 --> 39:46.017
I took them
over a week ago.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.819
You're going
through withdrawal.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.954
This is why
you're so depressed.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.558
I murdered my father.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.092
He's alive.
Luke, he's alive.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.528
Please don't lie to me.
I shot him in the head.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.864
No, it grazed him.
He's gonna be okay.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.833
There was blood
all over the floor.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.135
Listen to me. I just talked
to him an hour ago.

40:04.169 --> 40:07.739
He wanted me to tell you
that he's sorry.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.179
He said all of this
is his fault.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.048
You're the only good thing
in his life.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.851
No. He wouldn't say that.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.853
You'll have to take
my word for it.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.890
Let him tell you himself.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.925
I can see him?

40:26.958 --> 40:30.529
He wants to see you.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.873
Hi, Dad.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.948
I'm sorry.

41:28.053 --> 41:28.119
