It's a cat with a piece
of bread around its head.

01:12.998 --> 01:14.582
I know. It's called breading.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.168
It's totally super cute and weird.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.252
People put bread around their cats' heads

01:18.286 --> 01:19.954
and then take pictures.

01:20.005 --> 01:21.071
Why? What? How?

01:21.089 --> 01:23.674
Hey, Dr. Goran, you're cutting.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.626
You talking to me?

01:25.677 --> 01:27.211
(loudly) Yes, Dr. Joel Goran.

01:27.245 --> 01:29.463
There are all these people
waiting in line for coffee.

01:29.514 --> 01:31.265
What-what makes you
think you can cut ahead?

01:31.299 --> 01:32.433
I didn't know there was a line.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.101
Well, now you do.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.104
- Could you tell?
- What?

01:37.139 --> 01:39.423
I totally have a crush on that guy.

01:39.441 --> 01:41.058
Was I acting all shy and giddy?

01:41.092 --> 01:42.777
I get like that with guys I like.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.428
You were acting rude.

01:44.446 --> 01:45.863
Or I get the opposite. I don't know.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.449
I don't know how I act.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.738
<i>(Charlie) I used to be
the chief of surgery.</i>

01:54.772 --> 01:56.824
<i>Now I'm two guys.</i>

01:56.875 --> 01:59.493
<i>One is in coma.</i>

01:59.544 --> 02:02.313
<i>The other is invisible.</i>

02:02.347 --> 02:03.780
(woman) Oxygen.

02:03.799 --> 02:06.717
You're supposed to write
something like "I like puppies"

02:06.751 --> 02:08.051
or "my hobby is boating."

02:08.086 --> 02:09.804
He is so not that guy.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.688
I can get the nurses
to find you a cot, you know.

02:11.725 --> 02:12.422
Chair's great.

02:12.457 --> 02:13.974
I'm becoming one of those
square Japanese watermelons.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.643
(chuckles) Honestly,
it's totally good, Mel.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.261
Alex, O.R. nurse called.

02:17.295 --> 02:18.896
They're looking for you down there.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.931
(sighs, whispers) Damn it.
Of course they are.

02:20.965 --> 02:23.400
Alex, do me a favor.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.853
Let people be nice to you.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.404
Don't do that.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.572
Don't make me cry, because if I start,

02:28.607 --> 02:30.574
I won't be able to stop.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.159
And that's not a joke.

02:38.983 --> 02:39.950
Hey, Alex.

02:39.984 --> 02:41.502
Can't talk, Joel.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.653
Dr. Kinney's looking for you.

02:42.671 --> 02:44.705
I'm late for the O.R. Hey, is that coffee?

02:44.756 --> 02:46.457
- Take it.
- It's not that fermented stuff you drink?

02:46.491 --> 02:48.759
Kombucha? No. It's not. It's coffee.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.628
Thank god.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.680
Hey, how's Charlie?

02:52.714 --> 02:54.765
No change.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.800
Oh, man, really?

02:56.834 --> 02:57.801
Good luck.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.887
Nice haircut.

02:59.938 --> 03:01.188
Thank you.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.140
Dr. Kinney.

03:03.174 --> 03:04.675
Congrats on being made chief of surgery.

03:04.693 --> 03:06.810
Interim chief.

03:06.844 --> 03:09.613
The minute Charlie opens
those baby blues, I'm out.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.448
- How's he doing?
- He's doing fine.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.700
Mm-hmm. Well, it's only been three days.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.151
Not catastrophic.

03:14.185 --> 03:16.654
If there's no changes in three weeks,

03:16.688 --> 03:18.412
then, you know, you're up a creek.

03:18.712 --> 03:20.707
The patient needs a tumor removed
from her adrenal gland.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.042
We'll go in laparoscopically.

03:22.077 --> 03:25.713
- Hey, Victor, you see the game?
- I saw linebackers.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.214
Why is Reycraft scrubbing into my O.R.?

03:27.249 --> 03:29.049
He's doing the surgery.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.418
- Mrs. Sopinka's my patient.
- Yeah, but you're late.

03:31.469 --> 03:33.087
You may be chief surgical resident,

03:33.138 --> 03:34.371
but I'm not your boyfriend.

03:34.389 --> 03:37.258
No special treatment, Reid.
Get to your rounds.

03:37.309 --> 03:39.810
She threw a clamp at me once.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.845
All the nurses think she's got a peen.

03:41.879 --> 03:45.399
(chuckles) I'm just saying,
we all miss Dr. Harris.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.151
You can tell him that when he wakes up.

03:48.904 --> 03:50.404
(man speaking indistinctly)

03:50.438 --> 03:54.575
(monitor beeping steadily)

03:58.446 --> 03:59.896
(indistinct conversations)

03:59.915 --> 04:01.615
- Zach.
- Hey.

04:01.666 --> 04:04.835
- What do you got for me?
- Uh, Kym Spencer, 23 years old,

04:04.869 --> 04:06.787
fell off her bike, broke her leg.
It's pretty bad.

04:06.838 --> 04:07.788
How bad?

04:07.839 --> 04:09.406
- Open tib fib.
- Nice.

04:09.424 --> 04:11.008
- See how excited you get?
- Oh, I'm excited.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.044
- Oh, hey, she's, uh, refusing pain meds.
- Okay.

04:14.078 --> 04:17.130
Hey, Kym? Hi. I'm Dr. Goran.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.432
Uh, look, I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.733
Can you feel your leg?

04:19.767 --> 04:21.635
- (voice breaking) Yeah.
- All right, can you feel it

04:21.685 --> 04:24.555
- when I touch your foot like that...
- Can you not touch her, please?

04:24.589 --> 04:26.223
You know what? I'd really prefer
a female doctor, actually.

04:26.257 --> 04:28.225
Well, I'm the doctor on call.

04:28.259 --> 04:30.311
And believe me, I'm your guy.

04:30.362 --> 04:32.813
- Are we cool?
- Yeah.

04:32.864 --> 04:34.782
Okay, can you feel your foot, Kym?

04:34.816 --> 04:36.617
All right, you have a compound fracture,

04:36.651 --> 04:38.152
and we need to take some X-rays,

04:38.203 --> 04:39.737
and then we're gonna... (crying)

04:39.771 --> 04:40.904
- What, is it your shoulder?
- Yeah.

04:40.938 --> 04:42.206
All right.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.958
(sobbing)

04:43.992 --> 04:46.043
(groans)

04:46.077 --> 04:47.962
All right, let's get her
some I.V. antibiotics

04:47.996 --> 04:49.213
and give her a tetanus shot.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.497
Also, let's get a general surgeon

04:50.548 --> 04:52.166
- to take a look at her.
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

04:52.217 --> 04:54.051
All right, I got this.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.470
Whoa. Is it bad? I mean, is it... is it bad?

04:56.504 --> 04:59.223
- It's bad, isn't it?
- I'm just being thorough, okay?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.091
It's okay.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.509
(woman) I don't know
how long he's gonna be here,

05:02.560 --> 05:05.929
so can you bring some, uh,
underwear and some socks in case

05:05.963 --> 05:07.982
and, uh, also can you feed the fish?

05:08.016 --> 05:11.402
That would help.
Cal, how many pinches of food?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.636
Two pinches.

05:12.654 --> 05:15.138
Two pinches of food. Right.
And can you clean...

05:15.156 --> 05:16.407
This is Cal's third visit
to Hope-Zee this month.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.025
He's got diarrhea, so we're hydrating him.

05:18.076 --> 05:19.526
Some abdominal pain.

05:19.577 --> 05:21.662
- How's the ultrasound?
- I didn't see anything on it.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.863
Chest and abdo X-ray.

05:22.897 --> 05:25.332
C.B.C. and lytes, L.F.T.S
and enzymes... nothing.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.084
Cal, the blood pressure cuff
is just gonna hug your arm.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.752
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.538
Cal, you've been having
a lot of stomachaches?

05:31.589 --> 05:33.841
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.009
Have you been eating anything weird?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.960
No.

05:36.994 --> 05:40.047
Is anything bugging you at school or...

05:40.098 --> 05:41.965
Mm, no.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.884
Give him an M.R.
Cal, that's a picture

05:43.935 --> 05:45.602
that's gonna let us see
what's really going on

05:45.637 --> 05:47.054
in that belly of yours.

05:47.105 --> 05:49.273
- Your dad's on his way, okay, buddy?
- Okay.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.358
Cal, focus.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.943
Stop touching me!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.229
I just need you to... ow. Ow. Ow! Ow!

05:55.280 --> 05:56.397
Cal!

05:56.448 --> 05:58.866
- Are you okay?
- He bit me!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.452
I am so sorry.
He's not normally like this.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.654
Cal, you can't do that, buddy.

06:03.688 --> 06:04.955
He's really out of control right now.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.407
Shut up!

06:06.458 --> 06:08.409
This is not like him.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.879
It's okay. We're gonna make you better.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.547
That little zombie better not have hep-C.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.915
His diarrhea's not trending up.

06:14.966 --> 06:17.000
That was a joke. "Trending up"?

06:17.034 --> 06:19.636
(scoffs) Why can't you residents
just talk like people?

06:19.671 --> 06:21.204
Here. You need to sign this.

06:21.222 --> 06:22.855
Can you give 2 acetaminophen
to the guy in 237?

06:22.855 --> 06:23.355
(woman) Sure.

06:23.355 --> 06:24.842
I'll do a psych assessment
for Cal if you'd like.

06:24.876 --> 06:26.560
His parents are getting a divorce,
so he's <i>loco.</i>

06:26.594 --> 06:29.480
That's my assessment. Now I'm going home.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.231
Ay-yi-yi.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.383
Why would someone so mean
become a pediatrician?

06:33.401 --> 06:35.269
You're sane, and you're a shrink.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.738
Yeah, but I have my neuroses.
I don't like thick drinks.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.490
You're afraid of milkshakes.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.692
Yeah, and spiders

06:41.726 --> 06:44.445
and heights and caves.

06:44.496 --> 06:46.029
Can't have my foods touch.

06:46.063 --> 06:49.232
Raccoons freak me out
with the <i>hands.</i>

06:49.250 --> 06:50.417
(chuckles)

06:50.452 --> 06:52.252
I think a lot about the end of the world,

06:52.287 --> 06:53.954
and I wish I was better with women,

06:54.005 --> 06:56.840
socially and... sexually.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.742
(scoffs)

06:58.760 --> 07:00.761
Uh... Dr. Reid?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.263
(button clicks) If you ever
need to talk to anyone...

07:03.298 --> 07:04.598
I realize that sounds like I mean sexually

07:04.632 --> 07:07.217
'cause of what I just said. Just asking.

07:09.253 --> 07:11.522
Drop this bad boy off for me. Thank you.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:27.772 --> 07:29.289
Is that who I think it is?

07:29.324 --> 07:32.876
Yep. Charlie's ex-wife.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.662
<i>This is what I love about you, Alex.</i>

07:35.713 --> 07:38.632
You face things.
You walk <i>towards</i> trouble.

07:38.666 --> 07:42.136
<i>You look it right in the eye,
and when you have to,</i>

07:42.170 --> 07:44.605
<i>you fight.</i>

07:46.408 --> 07:48.066
Dawn, how are you?

07:49.216 --> 07:50.621
I'm devastated.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.748
How are you?

07:53.535 --> 07:56.395
Well, you know,
it's... it's been weird, Dawn.

07:56.536 --> 08:00.806
(monitor beeping steadily)

08:01.055 --> 08:01.555
Oh.

08:04.497 --> 08:06.252
Just, I was in town for the day,

08:06.298 --> 08:10.165
and... so I thought that I, um...

08:11.033 --> 08:14.302
I'll just shut up. Oh, this is awkward.

08:14.423 --> 08:16.421
No, you're... you're here to see Charlie.

08:16.472 --> 08:19.925
That's great.

08:19.976 --> 08:23.145
I just need to change his
I.V. and suction his phlegm.

08:23.179 --> 08:25.480
Nurses do that, usually.

08:25.515 --> 08:27.766
Makes me feel closer to him.

08:29.131 --> 08:29.631
Right.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.654
Uh, can I ask?

08:32.688 --> 08:36.274
Has Charlie been started
on coma arousal therapy?

08:36.325 --> 08:38.827
We're doing everything we can for Charlie.

08:38.861 --> 08:43.248
Yeah, well, can I tell you
about coma arousal therapy?

08:43.282 --> 08:46.168
You expose the patient to
extreme physical stimuli...

08:46.202 --> 08:49.788
smells like rubbing alcohol,
touch like deep massage,

08:49.839 --> 08:51.873
sexual stimulation.

08:52.093 --> 08:53.996
I've... heard about it.

08:55.548 --> 08:57.142
Well, wouldn't it be worth trying?

08:57.756 --> 08:59.544
Studies show it doesn't
make any difference

08:59.581 --> 09:00.939
in patient awareness.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.442
Right.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.470
We're doing everything, Dawn.

09:09.512 --> 09:11.443
No, you're doing everything
that you know how to do.

09:12.099 --> 09:13.521
That's not the same thing.

09:13.614 --> 09:15.814
You can reduce the sedation,
give him zolpidem.

09:15.865 --> 09:17.065
There's coma arousal therapy,

09:17.099 --> 09:19.484
There's transcranial magnetic stimulation.

09:19.535 --> 09:22.037
- There's acupuncture...
- Those are all unproven.

09:22.071 --> 09:23.772
Well, I would think that
you would try anything.

09:25.074 --> 09:26.708
I know that I would.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.581
<i>Well, there it is, then...</i>

09:32.615 --> 09:37.219
<i>your second opinion,
whether you want it...</i>

09:37.841 --> 09:38.837
<i>or not.</i>

09:46.470 --> 09:47.227
You.

09:49.879 --> 09:50.784
You're my consult.

09:50.849 --> 09:51.593
That's right.

09:51.837 --> 09:52.664
Okay.

09:52.747 --> 09:53.885
I am Maggie Lin.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.579
I'm a third year surgical resident.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.233
You might remember me from this morning

09:57.265 --> 09:58.983
when you cut in line for coffee.

09:59.408 --> 10:00.692
Although you have such a god complex,

10:00.734 --> 10:02.900
you probably don't remember me at all.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.814
(chuckles) No, I definitely
remember who you are.

10:06.332 --> 10:09.090
Don't worry about that. Come with me.

10:11.774 --> 10:14.756
I... would... say...

10:15.326 --> 10:17.542
you have a...

10:17.876 --> 10:19.317
a ruptured spleen.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.363
- But her shoulder hurts.
- It's a common symptom.

10:21.428 --> 10:23.012
It's called Kehr's sign.

10:23.128 --> 10:24.176
Right, but before we can deal with that,

10:24.222 --> 10:26.101
I'm gonna have to set
this leg temporarily.

10:26.135 --> 10:29.331
Kym, its gonna hurt... a lot.

10:29.692 --> 10:30.805
We'll get you some morphine...

10:30.833 --> 10:32.241
No. No drugs.

10:33.636 --> 10:35.022
Well, hold her hand, then.

10:36.028 --> 10:37.395
Dr. Lin, I'm gonna need
you for counter-pressure.

10:37.446 --> 10:38.233
You done this before?

10:38.302 --> 10:40.256
- Once.
- That's enough.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.866
All right, place your
hands above the knee.

10:42.191 --> 10:44.902
Please. And we pull back
on the count of three.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.905
One... two... three.

10:47.956 --> 10:49.824
(bones crunching) Aah!

10:49.858 --> 10:52.293
(screaming loudly)

10:52.328 --> 10:53.544
(curtain rings swoosh)

10:53.579 --> 10:54.712
We're gonna get you into an ultrasound

10:54.747 --> 10:56.547
and get you into surgery ASAP.

10:56.582 --> 10:57.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Surgery?

10:57.750 --> 10:59.217
We need to remove her spleen.

10:59.251 --> 11:00.718
Does that involve a blood transfusion?

11:00.753 --> 11:01.969
Yes.

11:02.004 --> 11:03.721
She can't have it, then.

11:03.756 --> 11:05.373
What are you talking about?
She's bleeding internally.

11:05.391 --> 11:07.141
She needs to be transfused.

11:07.176 --> 11:09.977
Our religion forbids
blood transfusions, okay?

11:10.012 --> 11:13.731
I'm sorry. She can't.

11:13.766 --> 11:16.150
(crying)

11:16.185 --> 11:19.103
(siren wailing in distance)

11:27.196 --> 11:29.163
Hey, Cal.

11:29.198 --> 11:30.998
Hey.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.367
So you going home, then?

11:32.401 --> 11:33.751
Yeah, my dad's getting the car.

11:33.786 --> 11:35.686
You feeling better?

11:35.721 --> 11:39.040
Uh... I guess so.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.958
Hey, do you mind if I sit down?

11:41.009 --> 11:43.511
I mean, you're not gonna bite me, are you?

11:50.185 --> 11:52.103
Did your pediatrician diagnose you?

11:52.137 --> 11:55.106
I mean, did, uh,
did she say you had something,

11:55.140 --> 11:56.474
like a tummy ache or the flu?

11:56.525 --> 11:59.060
Uh, no. She just said it
was one of those things.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.778
Cal?

12:00.813 --> 12:02.280
- What are you feeling, Cal?
- I don't know... (breathing heavily)

12:02.314 --> 12:04.242
- Does your stomach hurt?
- No.

12:04.279 --> 12:06.270
Is it hard to breathe?
Are you having a hard time breathing?

12:06.302 --> 12:06.884
Yeah. (panting)

12:07.202 --> 12:08.870
- Okay, Cal.
- I feel dizzy.

12:08.904 --> 12:10.955
Cal. Cal!

12:10.989 --> 12:12.373
(people gasp)

12:12.408 --> 12:13.993
Cal, open your eyes.

12:16.662 --> 12:19.780
I need the code team!
Code blue! Code blue!

12:19.798 --> 12:23.918
<i>(P.A. beeps) (woman) Code blue...
(speaking indistinctly)</i>

12:23.952 --> 12:26.471
Let's go! Let's go! He's V.S.A.

12:26.505 --> 12:27.755
Didn't we already admit this kid?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.390
Yeah, he got discharged.
Start a wide bore I.V.

12:29.425 --> 12:30.558
and give him a liter.

12:30.592 --> 12:32.093
All right, expose his chest.
Get the leads on him.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.511
- When did he code?
- Under five.

12:33.562 --> 12:34.762
Hold C.P.R.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.097
He crashed in the atrium.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.515
Get me an oropharyngeal.

12:37.566 --> 12:39.567
(fabric rips) All right, get it started.

12:39.601 --> 12:40.935
E.C.G. showing some activity.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.487
P.E.A. resume, resume.
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:42.521 --> 12:44.939
Keep bagging him.
We gotta get his pressure back up.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.274
(monitor beeping rapidly)
He's going V-fib.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.243
- Prep the panels.
- Come on, Cal.

12:49.278 --> 12:50.244
360 joules.

12:50.279 --> 12:52.029
How are we doing on that line?

12:52.080 --> 12:53.781
- Working on it.
- Run that bolus. Get me epi.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.316
(woman) Cithdrawing epi.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.541
Kid? Can you see me?

13:03.592 --> 13:05.293
(man's voice echoing indistinctly)

13:05.327 --> 13:06.711
(woman, faintly) Check pulse.

13:06.762 --> 13:10.097
(man's voice continues
echoing indistinctly)

13:10.132 --> 13:11.632
(whispers) Hey, buddy, let's go.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.884
(defibrillator whines) Clear!

13:12.935 --> 13:16.721

13:16.772 --> 13:19.357
(paddles thunk)

13:19.391 --> 13:21.192
Still no pulse.

13:21.226 --> 13:24.862
- (woman) All clear?
- Let's go again. Clear!

13:24.897 --> 13:26.781
(thunk, beeps)

13:28.233 --> 13:29.283
Nothing.

13:33.238 --> 13:36.207
(woman, faintly) All clear.
(defibrillator whines)

13:36.241 --> 13:38.025
(thunk)

13:40.028 --> 13:42.363
(defibrillator whines) All clear.

13:42.381 --> 13:45.833
Clear. (paddles thunk)

13:50.138 --> 13:51.305

13:51.340 --> 13:53.558
Sinus rhythm.

13:53.592 --> 13:55.593
(sighs) Holy hell.

13:55.644 --> 13:57.144
Hey, Cal.

14:06.331 --> 14:07.288
How is it?

14:07.743 --> 14:10.511
I am gonna need to speak
with my colleague.

14:10.546 --> 14:12.547
(scoffs) Well, she's gonna be okay, right?

14:13.473 --> 14:15.383
Kym, you really need this surgery.

14:15.417 --> 14:17.802
No blood.

14:17.853 --> 14:20.054
There are clotting agents
she can have, right?

14:20.088 --> 14:22.774
Of proconvertin?

14:22.808 --> 14:24.559
Unfortunately, she's bleeding so much

14:24.593 --> 14:26.311
that none of that will help.

14:26.362 --> 14:28.112
Well... (sighs) well, what can you do?

14:28.147 --> 14:31.543
I really need to consult
with a more senior doctor.

14:32.534 --> 14:33.224
Fine.

14:36.705 --> 14:39.624
(indistinct conversations)

14:41.943 --> 14:44.629

Disagree. Dr. Lin, what's up?

17:42.090 --> 17:44.926
Dr. Goran, there's a lot of
free fluid in Kym's abdomen.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.293
How bad's her spleen?

17:46.311 --> 17:48.212
Well, as far as I can tell,
it's shattered.

17:48.247 --> 17:50.314
She has about an hour and
a half before she bleeds out.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.016
Well, please keep her comfortable.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.734
That's it?

17:53.769 --> 17:56.571
Yeah, or page me if there's
any problems with her leg.

17:56.605 --> 17:58.239
Well, there's gotta be
something that we can do.

17:58.273 --> 17:59.607
We can't just let her die

17:59.641 --> 18:01.159
because she won't have a transfusion.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.577
Well, we don't have a choice.

18:02.611 --> 18:03.861
So you don't care?

18:03.912 --> 18:06.831
Of course I care,
but if she doesn't consent,

18:06.865 --> 18:09.116
there's really very little we can do.

18:09.150 --> 18:11.619
We could talk to the hospital ethicist.

18:11.653 --> 18:14.172
Yeah, maybe he could bore
her into having the surgery.

18:14.206 --> 18:15.623
You're such an ass.

18:15.657 --> 18:17.258
I've seen this kind of
thing before, all right?

18:17.292 --> 18:18.593
I did a fellowship in Mexico city,

18:18.627 --> 18:20.178
and I've seen more than
a few patients refuse blood

18:20.212 --> 18:21.379
on religious grounds.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.047
So you're just gonna let her slip away?

18:23.098 --> 18:25.633
Keep her hydrated.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.469
You went to med school in Mexico? Figures.

18:28.503 --> 18:31.305
I went to Harvard.

18:31.339 --> 18:33.891
Figures.

18:36.728 --> 18:38.679
Cal is very sick, but don't worry.

18:38.697 --> 18:40.281
I'll figure it all out.

18:40.315 --> 18:41.532
He has a heart problem?

18:41.567 --> 18:43.901
- Not necessarily.
- I-I don't understand.

18:43.952 --> 18:45.703
I mean, he came in here with diarrhea,

18:45.737 --> 18:47.121
and then he stops breathing.

18:47.155 --> 18:48.522
We should have brought him in sooner.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.491
You were the one who wanted to wait.

18:50.525 --> 18:52.326
Kids can crash really quickly.
Here's the thing.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.379
I need to operate on Cal.
His belly is distended,

18:55.414 --> 18:57.999
and this is new.
It could be a bowel obstruction.

18:58.033 --> 18:59.634
But I thought you said you
didn't know what he had.

18:59.668 --> 19:01.836
I don't, exactly.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.421
Well, what about all those
tests that you did? I mean...

19:03.472 --> 19:04.889
We didn't seen anything at the time.
Things progress.

19:04.923 --> 19:07.475
I gonna have to do what's called
an exploratory laparotomy.

19:07.509 --> 19:08.676
I actually have to go in to see

19:08.710 --> 19:10.728
what's causing his system to crash.

19:10.762 --> 19:12.980
- Couldn't that make him worse?
- This is our next step.

19:13.015 --> 19:15.266
He practically died.
Why are you questioning the doctor?

19:15.317 --> 19:17.068
Are you kidding me?
I'm just asking a question.

19:17.102 --> 19:18.218
You always think that you know everything.

19:18.237 --> 19:19.437
This is not the time to question him.

19:19.488 --> 19:21.072
- We need to get him better!
- Stop fighting!

19:21.106 --> 19:22.907
(monitor beeping erratically)
Dr. Reid, B.P.'s falling.

19:22.941 --> 19:24.242
B.P.'s 80. He's tachycardic.

19:24.276 --> 19:25.776
Open the valve and push fluids into him.

19:25.827 --> 19:27.695
- He's what? What-what does that mean?
- You need to move.

19:27.729 --> 19:29.113
- Can you tell me what that means, please?
- Come on, Cal.

19:29.164 --> 19:30.665
Don't you dare code on me again. Cal?

19:30.699 --> 19:32.083
- Cal, baby, can you hear me?
- You need to be out of here.

19:32.117 --> 19:34.335
- Can you please get them out of here?
- Can you hear me, baby?

19:34.369 --> 19:35.536
- Please tell us what's going on.
- I'm right here, baby.

19:35.570 --> 19:36.871
- I-I understand.
- What is happening?

19:36.905 --> 19:38.386
You gotta let the doctor
do her work, all right?

19:38.441 --> 19:39.024
Please.

They can't see you, buddy.

20:49.242 --> 20:51.793
♪

20:51.845 --> 20:54.012
They can't see me either.

20:55.515 --> 20:59.468
Yeah, you were kinda
dead for a minute there.

20:59.502 --> 21:00.686
Cool.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.606
Am I dead... now?

21:04.641 --> 21:06.725
I don't know.

21:06.759 --> 21:08.610
Well, I don't really think I'm dead,

21:08.645 --> 21:12.314
'cause I'm not... not all that scared.

21:12.365 --> 21:15.200
Cool. (exhales)

21:15.235 --> 21:17.986
Let's go for a walk.

21:18.037 --> 21:20.038
So... here's how this works.

21:20.073 --> 21:24.626
When people... patients...
die here at Hope Zion,

21:24.661 --> 21:28.130
they, um, they stick around for a while.

21:28.164 --> 21:30.966
So... you're a dead guy?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.918
No. No, I'm in a coma.

21:32.952 --> 21:35.420
Kind of a special case, I guess.

21:35.454 --> 21:36.788
Well, what's a coma?

21:36.806 --> 21:38.974
Uh, it's like being asleep.

21:39.008 --> 21:44.012
Sort of. Just a very, very deep sleep.

21:44.063 --> 21:46.565
So do you hang out with the dead people?

21:46.599 --> 21:48.984
(chuckles) Uh, not really.

21:49.018 --> 21:52.070
See, they, uh, they stick around,
then they leave.

21:52.105 --> 21:53.522
Well, where did they go?

21:53.573 --> 21:55.941
I don't know. I haven't
quite got to that part yet.

21:55.975 --> 21:56.975
- I don't wanna go anywhere.
- I'm not saying you will, pal.

21:56.993 --> 21:58.527
- I wanna go back to my parents.
- Okay.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.269
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- I wanna see my mom,
and I want my dad to see me.

22:00.338 --> 22:02.364
Okay. Okay, I understand.

22:02.415 --> 22:05.584
Hey, you came back from
the dead once, right?

22:05.618 --> 22:07.619
Yeah, but...

22:07.653 --> 22:09.588
So no big deal.

22:09.622 --> 22:12.291
- Wanna see a dead body?
- Okay.

22:12.325 --> 22:14.543
Cool! Let's go.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.962
(drawer slides)

22:16.996 --> 22:18.597
Where's that guy's ghost? (clank)

22:18.631 --> 22:20.882
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

22:20.934 --> 22:22.551
Don't worry. Most of
the people I've met around here

22:22.602 --> 22:25.053
are actually pretty nice.

22:25.104 --> 22:28.023
Hey, let's, uh, let's talk about you.

22:28.057 --> 22:29.808
Why don't you tell me about your symptoms?

22:29.842 --> 22:32.060
Are you a doctor?

22:32.111 --> 22:33.645
Yep.

22:33.679 --> 22:35.614
You don't look like a doctor.

22:35.648 --> 22:38.066
Yeah, not all the time.

22:38.117 --> 22:39.401
Come on. Tell me what's been going on.

22:39.452 --> 22:43.655
Maybe we can, uh...
figure this thing out together.

22:43.689 --> 22:49.378
I've been getting
stomachaches and diarrhea.

22:49.412 --> 22:51.413
Yeah? What else?

22:51.464 --> 22:52.881
Come on. Anything.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.082
Your toe hurt?

22:54.133 --> 22:56.251
No.

22:56.302 --> 22:59.805
Okay, we'll overlook toe cancer, then.

22:59.839 --> 23:04.393
What about, uh,
how you're feeling in here?

23:04.427 --> 23:07.062
You mad? You sad? Happy?

23:07.096 --> 23:10.548
I don't know. I've been getting mad.

23:10.566 --> 23:12.000
I bit my doctor.

23:12.035 --> 23:14.736
Dr. Rundle, the pediatrician?

23:14.771 --> 23:18.857
Good for you. She can be kinda mean.

23:18.891 --> 23:22.077
And my parents are getting a divorce.

23:22.111 --> 23:24.196
Yeah?

23:24.230 --> 23:27.666
And they're all like,
"now you have two homes."

23:27.700 --> 23:30.735
But I liked it better
when they were together,

23:30.753 --> 23:32.838
and they fight all the time 'cause of me.

23:32.872 --> 23:35.424
Buddy, they don't fight because of you.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.692
They do.

23:36.726 --> 23:39.678
They were happy till
I started getting sick.

23:39.712 --> 23:43.348
Cal, I don't think you could
make your parents unhappy.

23:43.383 --> 23:45.600
You hear me?

23:45.635 --> 23:46.751
And if your parents are getting a divorce,

23:46.769 --> 23:48.603
that's not your fault.

23:48.638 --> 23:53.525
Okay? Don't you ever think that.

23:53.559 --> 23:55.060
Cal, you're flushing.

23:55.094 --> 23:56.211
What?

23:56.245 --> 23:59.114
I know what's wrong with you.

23:59.148 --> 24:02.367
Come on. (breathing heavily)

24:02.402 --> 24:05.037
Come on.

24:05.071 --> 24:07.239
(beeping rapidly)

24:07.273 --> 24:09.491
We have a pulse. Cal?

24:09.542 --> 24:11.043
Cal?

24:11.077 --> 24:13.795
Buddy, you are a cat with nine lives.

24:13.830 --> 24:15.914
Look at his face.

24:15.948 --> 24:17.165
He's flushing.

24:17.216 --> 24:19.551
<i>She's got it.</i>

24:19.585 --> 24:21.720
It's the pathognomic symptom
for a carcinoid syndrome.

24:21.754 --> 24:24.306
Check his 5-H.I.A.A. now.

24:24.340 --> 24:27.309
Cal? Good news.

24:27.343 --> 24:29.845
I know what's wrong with you.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.596
(monitor beeping steadily)

24:31.630 --> 24:33.882
<i>I'll see you around, Cal.</i>

24:33.916 --> 24:35.734
Her pressure's dropping.
She's tachy at 140,

24:35.768 --> 24:37.135
and she's sweating buckets.

24:37.153 --> 24:39.938
- You want me to talk to her?
- She's restless and anxious.

24:39.972 --> 24:41.273
- How are her S.A.T.S.?
- Lousy.

24:41.307 --> 24:43.492
Okay.

24:43.526 --> 24:46.912
(breathing erratically)

24:46.946 --> 24:48.413
Hi, Kym. (curtain rings swoosh)

24:48.448 --> 24:50.749
I wanna get up and walk around.

24:50.783 --> 24:52.918
- Does that mean she's getting better?
- No.

24:52.952 --> 24:54.953
It means she's in hypovolemic shock.

24:54.987 --> 24:56.421
Kym, I need you to lie flat.

24:56.456 --> 24:57.789
We're gonna give you some saline solution

24:57.823 --> 25:00.459
- to increase your blood pressure.
- I'm getting up.

25:00.493 --> 25:02.377
Kym, I'm just gonna elevate your legs now.

25:02.428 --> 25:05.213
I don't... I can't feel my body.

25:05.264 --> 25:06.681
I'm dying.

25:06.716 --> 25:10.135
- No, no. You need to rest.
- Pray with me. Please pray with me.

25:10.169 --> 25:13.638
(crying) Please pray with me.
I wanna get... I wanna get up.

25:13.672 --> 25:15.474
- No, no, no.
- I wanna get up.

25:15.508 --> 25:17.776
Just let me... I don't feel good.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.979
I can't feel my body.
I'm dying. I'm dying.

25:21.013 --> 25:25.066
Pray-pray-pray with... pray with me!

25:25.118 --> 25:28.653
(hyperventilating)

25:28.687 --> 25:30.622
Would you do something for her?!

25:30.656 --> 25:34.159
It's up to you, man.

25:34.193 --> 25:38.079
Your wife's lost almost
40% of her blood volume.

25:38.131 --> 25:40.132
She's losing so much blood,

25:40.166 --> 25:42.884
that there's not enough
to get back to her heart.

25:42.919 --> 25:47.005
(Kym breathing heavily)

25:47.039 --> 25:49.891
Is she dying?

25:49.926 --> 25:51.226
Sorry, Aaron.

25:51.260 --> 25:54.563
Yes, she is.

25:56.983 --> 25:59.734
(whispers indistinctly)

25:59.769 --> 26:02.720
Please. (crying)

26:09.061 --> 26:11.329
It's okay. (kisses) I love you.

26:11.364 --> 26:13.915
(kisses)

26:24.427 --> 26:27.095
Give her the surgery.

26:27.129 --> 26:29.347
Give me 2 units of O-neg,

26:29.382 --> 26:30.882
and get Aaron here to sign a consent form.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.017
Aaron, I'm sorry.

26:32.051 --> 26:33.268
You're gonna have to stay behind.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.554
- Go scrub. O.R. three.
- Okay.

26:37.590 --> 26:38.523
You did the right thing.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.451
(doors squeak)

26:57.681 --> 26:59.002
Cas has cancer?

26:59.111 --> 27:02.036
I think he has a ** tumor
called a carcinoid.

27:02.036 --> 27:03.350
Well, what does that mean?

27:03.605 --> 27:05.489
It's a tumor that secretes hormones.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.741
And his system has been going crazy

27:06.775 --> 27:08.693
because the hormones dump
into his bloodstream.

27:08.727 --> 27:11.662
That's why he's flushing, why he's moody

27:11.697 --> 27:12.830
and bit Dr. Rundle.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.115
Okay, so now that you know this,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.200
I mean, he's gonna be okay, right?

27:16.234 --> 27:17.901
We just need to remove the tumors.

27:20.839 --> 27:26.010
Can I, uh... can I ask,
is this our fault somehow?

27:26.044 --> 27:27.378
Paul, please.

27:27.412 --> 27:29.513
No, it's-it's nobody's fault.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.766
It's... we're doing the best we can, okay?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.768
But we don't always see eye to eye,

27:33.802 --> 27:35.970
and-and, you know, you know what I mean.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.479
Just, he doesn't even have his own
bedroom at my place.

27:37.516 --> 27:39.724
And I get really upset sometimes,
and he sees it made him...

27:39.758 --> 27:42.893
I am not blaming this on you,
okay, at all.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.196
You obviously love your son very much.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.564
You didn't make him sick.

27:46.598 --> 27:49.700
I know you're worried,
but you're in the right place.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.535
We will take very good care of him.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.771
Now a nurse will take you
down to an O.R. waiting room.

27:53.789 --> 27:54.989
I'll see you soon.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.207
Thank you.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.408
Okay.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.747
You didn't seem the least bit surprised

28:02.781 --> 28:06.167
- when Aaron changed his mind.
- Ah, it's a man's prerogative.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.635
There were 2 units of O-neg

28:07.669 --> 28:09.503
<i>conveniently</i> waiting
in the room,

28:09.554 --> 28:11.722
and you had an O.R. on standby.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.624
You knew the entire time

28:13.642 --> 28:15.726
that he wouldn't let his
wife die, didn't you?

28:15.761 --> 28:17.678
(scrubbing hands)

28:17.729 --> 28:19.480
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

28:19.514 --> 28:21.348
'Cause I can't decide
whether you're insane

28:21.400 --> 28:22.900
or a genius.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.301
How did you know the husband would cave?

28:24.336 --> 28:25.486
I didn't, really.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.021
I thought he... might... probably.

28:27.842 --> 28:29.195
You could have told me.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.025
Well, then you wouldn't
have learned anything,

28:31.076 --> 28:32.777
and this is a teaching hospital.

28:32.811 --> 28:36.697
I am sickened by you and
also totally turned on.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.382
Maggie. (water running)

28:38.417 --> 28:39.834
I'm just kidding.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.836
You're gonna observe my surgery, right?

28:41.870 --> 28:45.506
Maggie, I feel like you
have a crush on me,

28:45.540 --> 28:47.925
and it makes me uncomfortable.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.794
I do not have a crush on you.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.128
Good.

28:51.162 --> 28:52.513
But I'd do you.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.637
Goran, you're, uh, ortho. What gives?

28:59.671 --> 29:02.306
- Yeah, I'm observing today.
- Ah.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.175
Dr. Lin's extremely persistent.

29:05.193 --> 29:06.193
Yeah, she's earned this surgery,

29:06.228 --> 29:08.946
so, uh, let her have this one, okay?

29:08.980 --> 29:13.284
Sure. I always wanted to
give Lin a splenectomy.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.121
Dude, that doesn't even make sense.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.789
Think about it.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.878
(siren wailing in distance)

29:28.583 --> 29:31.802
Are we doing everything
we can for Charlie?

29:31.837 --> 29:33.387
Yes.

29:33.421 --> 29:34.388
What about reducing his sedation

29:34.422 --> 29:36.590
and giving him zolpidem?

29:36.641 --> 29:38.325
I've tried that already.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.936
Coma arousal therapy?

29:48.987 --> 29:51.822
That's a flaky thing.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.074
(scribbling)

29:54.109 --> 29:58.162
(scoffs) Transcranial
magnetic stimulation?

30:00.031 --> 30:02.500
That is ridiculous. Who's been
talking to you about this?

30:02.534 --> 30:04.752
Charlie's ex-wife.

30:04.786 --> 30:06.120
Dawn bell?

30:06.591 --> 30:08.455
Alex, she's a cardiologist.

30:08.490 --> 30:09.673
She doesn't know a thing about comas.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.376
This... this is neuro.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.257
Why isn't Charlie waking up?

30:30.595 --> 30:33.531
(clears throat)

30:33.565 --> 30:36.734
Comas... are mysterious.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.202
And that's coming from someone

30:38.236 --> 30:40.037
who has an intricate
knowledge of the brain.

30:40.071 --> 30:41.455
I need a mochaccino.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.113
You should be careful of Dawn.

30:50.131 --> 30:51.549
How so?

30:51.583 --> 30:54.251
Hmm. You're not married to Charlie.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.803
You really should be his
legal decision maker

30:55.837 --> 30:58.172
in case things drag out.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.975
I've seen it before.

31:01.009 --> 31:03.961
(monitor beeping steadily,
suction gurgling)

31:09.100 --> 31:10.351
(reycraft) Now, Maggie, I want you

31:10.402 --> 31:13.354
to reach in and cut
the spleen with your hand.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.739
Now gently lift it towards the midline.

31:15.774 --> 31:18.359
Excellent.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.078
Clamping. Cut the hilum of the spleen.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.034
(snip)

31:27.085 --> 31:29.587
Now you can remove the spleen,

31:29.621 --> 31:32.289
and I'll tie off the splenic vessels.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.126
All right. I need suction.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.046
(under breath) That's what she said.

31:39.097 --> 31:43.017
(suction gurgling)

31:43.051 --> 31:46.003
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:50.508 --> 31:52.359
Okay.

31:52.394 --> 31:55.529
(monitor beeping erratically)

31:55.563 --> 31:56.897
- You've got to be kidding me.
- He's crashing.

31:56.948 --> 31:58.032
He's having a carcinoid crisis.

31:58.066 --> 31:59.900
The tumor's dumping hormones.

31:59.951 --> 32:03.570
He needs octreotide, 100 micrograms.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

32:03.622 --> 32:04.788
(monitor emitting continuous tone)
He's asystolic.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.290
Come on, kid.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.993
Cal, I am not gonna let you freakin' die.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.867
(Cal) Hey, Charlie.

32:16.885 --> 32:18.585
(Charlie) Hey, Cal.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.054
Check it out.

32:20.088 --> 32:22.640
Listen, Cal, I don't
think we have much time.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.275
I need you to do a big favor for me.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.309
Okay, sure.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.928
You see Dr. Reid?

32:27.963 --> 32:30.514
I need you to send
a message to her from me.

32:30.548 --> 32:31.715
Can you do that?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.400
Yep.

32:33.435 --> 32:37.571
Just tell her you saw me.

32:41.159 --> 32:44.545
Just-just tell her that I love her.

32:44.579 --> 32:46.113
Can you do that, buddy?

32:46.164 --> 32:48.866
Yep.

33:02.464 --> 33:03.764
(monitor beeps)

33:03.798 --> 33:07.051
I got a pressure.
He's back at normal sinus rhythm.

33:07.085 --> 33:10.187
He's back. God, kid, you are amazing.

33:10.221 --> 33:14.892
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:14.926 --> 33:17.778
Okay.

33:17.812 --> 33:21.031
(siren wailing in distance)

33:28.490 --> 33:30.124
(knocks on doorframe)

33:30.158 --> 33:31.158
Hi.

33:31.209 --> 33:32.543
- Hi.
- How'd the kid go?

33:32.577 --> 33:33.877
Really well.

33:33.912 --> 33:37.881
Yeah? Good.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.583
Are we gonna have a problem, Dana?

33:39.617 --> 33:43.137
Well, I wasn't aware we had a problem now.

33:43.171 --> 33:45.672
I didn't get the job of
chief surgical resident

33:45.724 --> 33:47.674
because of Charlie.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.077
I got it because I work hard
and I'm good at what I do.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.895
Yeah, sure.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.964
I don't expect special treatment,

33:53.982 --> 33:56.299
but unless I screw up, I'm gonna need you

33:56.317 --> 33:58.352
to treat me with respect.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.487
Then don't screw up.

34:07.278 --> 34:08.911
(monitor beeping steadily)

34:08.947 --> 34:11.532
Hey, Cal, how are you feeling?

34:11.583 --> 34:12.833
(raspy voice) Better.

34:12.867 --> 34:15.536
Yeah? Well, it looks like
you're gonna be okay.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.004
We took out all those tumors.

34:17.038 --> 34:18.871
Cool.

34:18.922 --> 34:21.759
What you drawing?

34:23.645 --> 34:27.464
I don't know, but it's just
hard drawing with this.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.299
You know what?
I think it looks pretty good.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.434
Can I see it?

34:30.467 --> 34:31.685
Yeah.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.937
Yeah.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.722
Who's that?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.190
That's me.

34:37.225 --> 34:39.275
It's pretty realistic.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.643
Thanks.

34:40.678 --> 34:42.679
What about the guy in the suit?

34:42.697 --> 34:43.897
Is that your dad?

34:43.947 --> 34:47.951
No. My dad would never wear a suit.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.687
Hmm.

34:50.705 --> 34:52.121
Is that a bow tie?

34:54.708 --> 34:58.061
Yeah. That... that's a bow tie.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.213
But it's undone.

34:59.247 --> 35:00.380
Hmm.

35:01.749 --> 35:03.734
Who's the guy in the bow tie?

35:08.840 --> 35:10.724
He has...

35:10.758 --> 35:14.044
I don't really remember.

35:17.882 --> 35:19.733
Everything okay, Dr. Reid?

35:19.767 --> 35:21.468
Yeah. Cal's doing really well.

35:21.503 --> 35:23.213
You've got a little fighter on your hands.

35:23.458 --> 35:24.738
Yes, I do.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.904
I will check on you later.

35:29.444 --> 35:30.611
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.580
(speaking indistinctly)

35:39.287 --> 35:40.954
(gasps)

35:46.928 --> 35:48.345
(mutters)

35:52.550 --> 35:53.934
Cal?

35:53.968 --> 35:55.185
Yeah?

35:55.220 --> 35:56.904
Do you think I could have this?

35:56.938 --> 35:59.690
I mean, would you mind?
It would mean a lot to me.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.860
Sure. Here.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.281
Thank you.

36:07.315 --> 36:08.431
You're welcome.

36:25.244 --> 36:26.390
It's a really bad idea.

36:26.588 --> 36:27.955
It's a really good idea.

36:27.990 --> 36:29.857
- It's a bad idea.
- Good.

36:29.892 --> 36:33.144
(grunts and laughs)

36:33.195 --> 36:34.428
It's a bad idea.

36:34.446 --> 36:36.597
- But it feels good.
- Yes, it does.

36:36.615 --> 36:37.615
Is good.

36:37.649 --> 36:40.201
Okay, look.

36:40.235 --> 36:41.486
I'm not up for a relationship.

36:41.537 --> 36:44.739
Oh, please shut up.

36:46.241 --> 36:47.408
(thud)

36:47.442 --> 36:49.877
(sighs)

36:51.446 --> 36:53.581
- Does the door lock?
- No.

37:02.124 --> 37:03.808
(thud)

37:12.134 --> 37:14.468
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:14.486 --> 37:15.486
Think fast.

37:17.439 --> 37:19.157
Mmm, ham and cheese.

37:19.191 --> 37:20.158
Straight from the vending machine,

37:20.192 --> 37:22.276
- the way you like it.
- Thanks.

37:27.482 --> 37:29.167
Do you believe in ghosts?

37:29.201 --> 37:31.436
No. Why?

37:33.756 --> 37:35.957
This is gonna sound insane.

37:35.991 --> 37:38.042
Okay? But the kid I was
operating on today...

37:38.093 --> 37:41.746
He... he drew a picture
of a guy wearing a tux

37:41.780 --> 37:45.016
just like the one Charlie was
wearing on our wedding day

37:45.050 --> 37:46.134
before the crash.

37:46.168 --> 37:47.702
So?

37:47.736 --> 37:52.006
So...

37:55.277 --> 37:59.013
Honey, lots of people wear a tux...

37:59.031 --> 38:01.616
James Bond, Mr. Peanut.

38:04.019 --> 38:07.021
Charlie's not a ghost,

38:07.039 --> 38:08.406
because he's not dead.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.024
Yeah, it's-it's stupid. I just...

38:10.042 --> 38:13.027
it felt like a nice idea that he...

38:13.045 --> 38:16.848
I just... I wanted a...

38:16.882 --> 38:19.300
I wanted to <i>feel that he might...</i>

38:22.054 --> 38:24.806
Forget it. Forget it.

38:26.175 --> 38:27.592
Come out for a glass of wine.

38:27.643 --> 38:28.810
Do you good.

38:28.844 --> 38:31.929
No. No, I'm good. I'm fine.

38:31.980 --> 38:35.716
Okay.

38:44.576 --> 38:46.677
Favorite song.

38:48.564 --> 38:51.682
Who has a favorite song? (scoffs)

39:03.962 --> 39:07.248

39:37.546 --> 39:40.298
Of course we're lost,
because this road isn't on any map,

39:40.332 --> 39:42.667
because someone gutted
it with a stolen backhoe.

39:42.718 --> 39:44.302
It's called "the country."

39:44.336 --> 39:48.455
Yeah, this inn is just gonna
be two guys with banjos.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.392
