00:04.308 --> 00:04.526
.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.354
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.397 --> 00:07.790
sexually based offenses

00:07.833 --> 00:10.140
are considered
especially heinous.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.534
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.577 --> 00:14.318
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:14.362 --> 00:15.754
are members of an elite squad

00:15.798 --> 00:17.843
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.976
These are their stories.

00:20.933 --> 00:24.024
- Man, you're not half a hitman
from Juárez anymore.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.677
You're a NYPD officer.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.592
- But you don't think
Benson sees it like that.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.159
- So you're gonna keep
protecting a murderer?

00:29.203 --> 00:32.336
- Chili is
the only reason I'm alive.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.034
- You will find that friend

00:34.077 --> 00:36.166
and you will bring him
to justice.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.168
- He might be living
in the northeast.

00:38.212 --> 00:41.215
- Being a cop isn't
some sort of penance.

00:41.258 --> 00:44.653
You owe a debt to the
two people that were killed.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.699
- You're here early.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.049
Shouldn't you be at home

00:49.092 --> 00:51.529
alphabetizing your merit badges
or something?

00:51.573 --> 00:53.923
- The Girl Scouts of America
is a good organization.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.056
I learned a lot there.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.796
- That was a joke.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.885
I didn't know you actually
used to be a member.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.496
- Well, I was.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.367
- Well, in that case, I'll
take six boxes of thin mints.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.022
- How about a coffee instead?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.894
- No, I'm good.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.157
Morning, Captain.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.072
- Oh, good, you're here.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.203
My office.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.257
So...

01:23.300 --> 01:25.563
any update
on finding your friend?

01:28.044 --> 01:31.047
- I, uh--I made some calls.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.309
- Well, that sounds promising.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.137
- Look, I'm gonna find him
one of these days.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.138
- Nope.

01:35.182 --> 01:38.228
Today is that day.

01:38.271 --> 01:42.580
So I had Carisi subpoena
some money transfers

01:42.624 --> 01:44.756
to your friend's mother
down in Juárez.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.801
- OK.

01:45.844 --> 01:49.457
- A woman
by the name of El Santini

01:49.500 --> 01:51.937
sent quite a few of them.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.114
- El Santini.
- Does that name ring a bell?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.116
- I have no idea who it is.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.031
- Well, the money is being sent
from Camden, Maine.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.468
- OK, so we call Camden PD.

02:00.511 --> 02:04.080
- No, you're going up there.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.038
- What?

02:06.082 --> 02:08.301
It's, like, five hours away.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.999
- Yeah, don't worry,
I'll give you somebody

02:10.042 --> 02:11.174
to share the driving with.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.567
- Churlish?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.396
Can I take Muncy?

02:15.439 --> 02:17.093
- No.
- Why not?

02:17.137 --> 02:21.793
- Because the only thing worse
than a partner with no loyalty

02:21.837 --> 02:24.144
is a partner
with blind loyalty.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.058
But you already know that.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.582
You learned that from Chili.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.327
- Oh, my God, Lorraine.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.720
- [chuckles]
- You have outdone yourself.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.116
- I'll give your regards
to the chef.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.640
- Hmm, well, maybe I should
have sent him the bouquet.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.860
- Mm.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.210
- A toast.

02:47.254 --> 02:50.257
To my second husband,
whom I adore.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.649
My new beginning.

02:51.692 --> 02:55.305
Perhaps a little bit younger,
but...

02:55.349 --> 02:57.264
- We forged a new path.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.310
- Oh,
and I couldn't be happier.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.182
- Happy anniversary, my love.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.662
- Happy anniversary.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.448
- Well, we'll need
another 300,000 or so,

03:07.491 --> 03:08.927
which is doable

03:08.971 --> 03:11.234
as long as that new lieutenant
mayor shuts his mouth

03:11.278 --> 03:13.105
and votes yes, right?

03:13.149 --> 03:15.412
- Money well spent.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.284
- Time to check the market?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.242
- Something tells me
it's going up.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.766
- Up and down like clockwork.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.943
- More like in-out, right?
[laughter]

03:29.165 --> 03:30.514
- My husband,
where is he?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.081
- Oh, I'm sorry.
It's members only.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.257
- Oh, that's right.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.390
Where are my manners?

03:37.173 --> 03:39.043
Where the hell is he, hmm?
- You don't have to do this.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.525
- Where is he, hmm?

03:41.569 --> 03:44.311
Harold, you son of a bitch.

03:44.353 --> 03:46.617
Where are you?
- Alice?

03:46.661 --> 03:48.706
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.448
- Oh, I found condoms
in his briefcase.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.537
- Hey, Alice, calm down.
You've got this all wrong.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.365
- Oh, I'm not an idiot, Roger.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.975
Where is he?

03:57.019 --> 03:59.281
Harold. Harold.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.892
Harold.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.720

[women gasp]

04:15.429 --> 04:18.301

why you never come home?

You're hysterical.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.625
- What are we looking at?

04:37.668 --> 04:39.931
- Alice Wolcott,
novice skeet shooter.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.933
She used her own husband's
reproductive organs

04:41.977 --> 04:43.413
as her clay pigeon.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.154
- Well, I'm assuming
he did something to deserve it.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.417
- Well, she found some condoms
in his briefcase.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.245
- And how old are these girls?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.421
- 15.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.554
All from Jersey.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.772
Muncy's calling
their parents now.

04:54.816 --> 04:55.991
- OK.

04:56.034 --> 04:58.123
So bring the old men
to the precinct

04:58.167 --> 04:59.647
and have Carisi meet us there.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.086
- Excuse me, Captain Benson.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.088
This guy says he knows you.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.263
- Roger?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.569
- Olivia, thank God.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.311
This is all
a huge misunderstanding.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.356
- Involving 15-year-old girls?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.575
- Let me explain.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.968
Harold's the real victim here.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.143
He was shot by his wife.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.320
I myself was a witness.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.973
- Roger,
I'm not playing favorites here.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.758
If you want to provide
some kind of context,

05:23.801 --> 05:25.716
then I suggest
you talk to your wife.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.503
- I will see her later
at dinner at Café Carlyle.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.375
- You know one of the perps?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.464
- Yeah.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.858
He's the husband
of Lorraine Maxwell.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.774
- Oh, we're arresting
the husband of the head

05:39.817 --> 05:42.124
of the New York Trial Division?
- Oh, yeah.

05:42.167 --> 05:46.781
If he's so much as touched
one of these girls,

05:46.824 --> 05:50.001
we're gonna do
a lot more than that.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.099
If your boy Chili
is some badass cartel guy,

06:44.142 --> 06:45.448
what the hell is he doing
up here in Maine?

06:45.492 --> 06:46.971
- First of all,
he's not my boy.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.147
Let's get that straight.
- OK.

06:50.584 --> 06:53.413
How about you explain
how he came to be in Maine?

06:53.456 --> 06:55.676
- My guess,
if he's even up here,

06:55.719 --> 06:57.460
and I'm not convinced he is,

06:57.504 --> 06:59.767
he's part
of a distribution network.

06:59.810 --> 07:00.942
- In this country?

07:00.985 --> 07:02.291
- Girl, how do you think

07:02.334 --> 07:04.554
drugs get to every
street corner of America?

07:04.598 --> 07:07.557
- So it's possible that
Chili is loyal to the cartel

07:07.601 --> 07:09.211
after all of these years?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.561
- Loyalty is non-negotiable
in the cartel.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.085
Nothing else matters.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.739
That's why most guys
never get out.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.654

- Barely.

I was this close.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.788
- To what?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.267
- Dying.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.967
Chili should have added me
to list the bodies that night.

- But he covered for you
and now you owe him.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.146

- You didn't have to.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.582
It was all over your face.

That sick look when you came
out of Benson's office.

Thanks, Sarge.

That cop from Camden PD

got a clean sheet.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.913
She works at a school--
vice principal or something.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.002
- Well, we've been driving
for five hours

08:01.045 --> 08:02.656
and school's out
for the night,

08:02.699 --> 08:04.962

08:05.006 --> 08:06.224

08:06.268 --> 08:08.226
- I may have overreacted
with the gun,

08:08.270 --> 08:09.750
but I know what I saw.

08:09.793 --> 08:10.968
- Which is what exactly?

08:11.012 --> 08:12.361
- Harold and his friends
sitting there

08:12.404 --> 08:15.407
like Renaissance popes,
pants down,

08:15.451 --> 08:19.150
young girls half-naked
in their laps.

08:19.194 --> 08:22.066
- This is a mess.
- This is less than ideal.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.415
- How many actual suspects
do you have?

08:23.459 --> 08:25.069
- Three men caught by a witness

08:25.113 --> 08:26.506
for sexual contact
with a minor.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.420
- And the witness
being Alice Wolcott,

08:28.464 --> 08:30.248
the one who clipped her
husband's nuts with bird shot?

08:30.292 --> 08:32.642
- Harold Wolcott,
who's still in the hospital.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.905
The other two, Francis Fuller
and Dean Roberts,

08:35.950 --> 08:37.212
both waiting for the lawyers.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.256
- And what about the rest
of the club members?

08:38.299 --> 08:39.649
- Oh, we brought them all in

on suspicion
of promoting prostitution.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.573
- Who claims
he was just having a drink.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.010
- Underage girls
performing sex acts

08:53.054 --> 08:56.579
at a club where he just happens
to be sipping a pimp's cup?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.450
Were these girls paid?

08:58.494 --> 08:59.974
Were they threatened? Coerced?

09:00.017 --> 09:01.541
- Still untangling that web.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.848
I mean, at best,
Roger thought that

09:04.892 --> 09:08.591
these girls were granddaughters
of other club members.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.201
- Or at worst,

09:10.245 --> 09:13.988
he's participating
in the prostitution of minors.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.816
- Well, either way,
it doesn't bode well

09:15.859 --> 09:18.035
for Maxwell's second marriage.

This is the definition
of conflict of interest.

that he's involved.

that's horrific,

had no idea about any of this.

10:05.039 --> 10:08.999
He was brought in in zip ties?
- Well, we voided his arrest.

His morality, his character.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.932
I assure you,
Roger is innocent.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.630
- Well...

10:30.673 --> 10:35.286
let's hope that you don't have
to make those assurances,

10:35.330 --> 10:38.463
uh, in front of a jury.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.380
- My God.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.383
- At first, we were hired
to be hostesses.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.169
Greet members,
take coats, get drinks.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.692
- But then things changed?

10:49.736 --> 10:52.521
- Some of the guys
offered to pay

10:52.564 --> 10:56.699
for more personal attention.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.397
- What did that involve?
- Making out with them.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.269
Letting them touch us.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.531
Going into the sauna.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.185
- Did you have sex
with these men?

11:04.228 --> 11:07.754
- We never had sex-sex.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.059
- It was just oral.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.974
I was promised
a Balenciaga bag.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.672
- How did this start, Paige?

11:12.715 --> 11:16.066
- Six months ago, me, Daniella,
and Tara were at the mall.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.894
This guy came up to us,

11:17.938 --> 11:20.462
said he could get us work
at an upscale club in the city.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.768
- And who was this guy?

11:23.291 --> 11:25.206
- My client had no idea

11:25.249 --> 11:27.208
these girls were 15,
which is no defense.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.644
- No, it's not.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.254
- For starters,
he's looking

11:30.298 --> 11:32.169
at criminal sexual act
in the third.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.780
We could tack on
child endangerment.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.390
- Hang on.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.306
He may be willing to give you
the name of a very big fish.

11:38.349 --> 11:42.179
- The mastermind
of this whole sad chapter

11:42.223 --> 11:44.747
of the Whitmere Club's
200-year history.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.053
- Do you have any proof?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.272
- He's been trading Polaroids
of these girls

11:48.316 --> 11:50.057
like they're baseball cards.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.015
- Trading?
- Or selling?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.365
- Well,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.063
- No one is suggesting
that you are.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.456
- I have seen one or two
of them at the club before.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.371
- Roger, I strongly suggest

12:00.415 --> 12:02.722
that we wait
till Art Blumfeld gets here

12:02.765 --> 12:04.898
before we continue
this conversation.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.465
- If you want to wait
for your lawyer, that's fine.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.077
I understand.
- I have nothing to hide.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.949
I was under the impression that
these girls were hostesses.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.516
- And that's all?

12:15.952 --> 12:17.475
- I'm sorry.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.781
I wish there was more
I could tell you.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.478
[door opens]

12:20.522 --> 12:23.307
- Captain, there's something
you should hear.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.832
- Excuse me.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
- What do we get
in exchange for a name?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.400
- Do we look like lawyers
to you?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.402
- You barely look old enough
to be a cop.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.969
- But older than 15.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.711
Right, Francis?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.496
So either he talks
or he doesn't.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.064
What happens after that
is out of our hands.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.284
We have to talk to our DA.
- Oh.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.503
You will need
to talk to your DA.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.984
- Because his name
is Roger Briggs,

12:48.028 --> 12:50.421
Lorraine Maxwell's husband.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.294
- All right, tell us
how her husband is involved.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.036
- This goes
beyond prostitution.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.778
- If he's telling the truth--
Briggs' profited--

12:58.821 --> 13:00.431
sex trafficking.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.999
- Francis is a liar.
- Not another word, Roger.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.522
- I'm sorry, Lorraine.
- Not as sorry as you're gonna

13:04.566 --> 13:07.395
be if you utter another word
without a lawyer.

13:17.274 --> 13:17.492
.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.711
- So figure out our next move
on the case?

13:19.755 --> 13:20.930
- Yeah,
we indicted Francis Fuller,

13:20.974 --> 13:22.976
Dean Roberts,
and Harold Wolcott

13:23.019 --> 13:24.847
on criminal sexual acts
in the third.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.153
Francis Fuller's driving around

13:26.196 --> 13:27.763
procuring the girls
from the mall.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.460
- And what about
Maxwell's husband, Roger?

13:29.504 --> 13:30.897
- Well, I don't have enough
to indict him

13:30.940 --> 13:32.986
based solely on the words
of a co-conspirator.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.290
You get anything else
from the girls?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.163
- The girls swear
that every time

13:36.206 --> 13:38.992
they saw Roger in the club,
he was just having a drink.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.820
He never asked them
for sexual favors,

13:40.863 --> 13:41.864
gave them money, gifts.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.387
- And if he's involved in this,

13:43.431 --> 13:45.999
then he's definitely smart
enough to cover his tracks.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.174
- All right.
So what do you need?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.480
- Besides a sleep study?
- Oh.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.395
- I need a subpoena
for Roger's financials.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.875
I need a search warrant
for his house.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.137
- For his house?
[phone chimes]

13:54.181 --> 13:56.270
You mean their house.
- Eh.

13:56.313 --> 13:59.055
- So do we give Maxwell
a heads-up?

14:00.404 --> 14:03.146
- She's already
one step ahead of us.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.888
- I want to be transparent
about this whole situation,

14:05.932 --> 14:08.195
and I appreciate

14:08.238 --> 14:10.937
the awkward position
that it's putting you both in.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.374
- In the spirit
of transparency, Ms. Maxwell,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.202
we should not even
be here right now.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.335
- Underage girls
were sexually abused.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.946
Look, I want
to reassure you both

14:19.989 --> 14:21.773
that no one wants
these perpetrators

14:21.817 --> 14:23.427
brought to justice
more than I do.

14:23.471 --> 14:24.733
- We appreciate that.

14:24.776 --> 14:28.519
- But if Francis Fuller
is using my husband

14:28.563 --> 14:31.348
in an attempt
to mitigate his own guilt,

14:31.392 --> 14:33.350
I won't stand idly by.

14:33.394 --> 14:37.137
- Well, neither will we.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.617
But...

14:39.661 --> 14:40.836
there is an allegation

14:40.880 --> 14:43.186
that we are obligated
to investigate.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.928
- Look, all I'm asking
is that before you decide

14:45.972 --> 14:49.366
to execute a search warrant
or take any other steps,

14:49.410 --> 14:50.672
you talk to Roger.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.066
He's agreed to come in
and tell you his side.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.982
- OK, I think we can do that.

14:56.025 --> 14:59.202
OK, but, of course,
without you in the room.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.900
- Of course.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.515
[knocks at door]

15:07.558 --> 15:08.603
- Can I help you?

15:08.646 --> 15:09.821
- I'm Detective Velasco.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.519
This is Officer Churlish.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.826
- We have records that show us
that you send remittances

15:14.870 --> 15:19.527
to one Paula Mendoza
in Juárez, Mexico.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.920
- That's not illegal.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.573
- No, it's not.

15:22.617 --> 15:25.794
Um, could you tell us

15:25.837 --> 15:28.884
why you would do this
for Miss Mendoza?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.105
- I'm involved
with a Catholic charity.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.977
We have a sister church
in Juárez.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.588
Paula is a widow
and parishioner there.

15:37.632 --> 15:38.894
She lives alone.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.504
I felt bad for her.

15:40.548 --> 15:44.334
- Right, so you just wanted
to help her out.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.120
- Mm.
[school bell rings]

15:47.163 --> 15:50.036
That's the warning bell
before recess.

15:50.079 --> 15:53.126
Uh, I have to get going.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.955
I hope I was able to help you.

15:57.695 --> 16:01.221
- 20 grand in remittances
over a couple of years

16:01.264 --> 16:03.788
to some widow in Mexico
on a vice principal salary?

16:03.832 --> 16:06.139
- You think she's lying?
- You don't?

16:06.182 --> 16:08.141
- Maybe she's a good person.

16:08.184 --> 16:11.100
- That's convenient.
- What is?

16:11.144 --> 16:13.973
- Your sudden air of
opportunistic faith in humanity

16:14.016 --> 16:16.410
just because you want to go
back to Manhattan empty-handed.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.411
- And why would I want
to do that?

16:17.454 --> 16:18.847
- I don't know.
You tell me.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.370
[indistinct chatter]

16:23.069 --> 16:25.854
Velasco, what's the problem?

16:25.897 --> 16:27.203
- Nothing.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.426
- Is that him?

16:32.469 --> 16:34.689
- Yeah, that's him.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.212
That's Chili.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.434
- My client acknowledges

16:40.477 --> 16:42.958
the Whitmere Club
has employed these girls.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.178
There are paychecks
from the members fund,

16:45.221 --> 16:46.657
but it's all legitimate.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.399
- They were employees, huh?
In what capacity exactly?

16:49.443 --> 16:51.923
- Well, as I said before,
as hostesses

16:51.967 --> 16:54.056
and sometimes entertainers.

16:54.100 --> 16:58.060
- Well, that's new information.
Go on.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.888
- We installed a Grecian pool
earlier this year,

16:59.931 --> 17:02.195
and some of the members thought
it might be period-appropriate

17:02.238 --> 17:05.546
to employ a few...nymphets.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.851
- Nymphets?

17:06.895 --> 17:08.896
- They were decorative,
part of the scenery.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.682
It was all very,
you know, Dionysian.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.555
But they were
somewhat scantily clad.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.512
So perhaps that's where
some of the confusion lies.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.037
- No, there's no confusion,
Mr. Price.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.344
- We have three girls on record

17:21.387 --> 17:25.131
saying that they gave
sexual favors to club members

17:25.174 --> 17:27.262
in exchange
for money and gifts.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.222
- And you've already charged
the three guilty men,

17:29.265 --> 17:30.701
including Francis Fuller.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.878
- Who made a serious allegation
against your client.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.098
- Which is completely
unsubstantiated.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.753
- Fuller's a predator,
but he's not stupid.

17:38.796 --> 17:42.409
Why would he make patently
false allegations against you?

17:42.452 --> 17:44.672
- He's trying
to get leverage on me.

17:45.673 --> 17:48.850
Francis and I are in
a real estate venture together.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.678
I hold the majority stake,

17:50.721 --> 17:54.029
and he would do anything
to get me to sell my shares.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.162
It's blackmail.

18:02.820 --> 18:07.608
- So Roger said that Francis is
blackmailing him over a deal?

18:07.651 --> 18:09.088
- He didn't tell you?

18:09.131 --> 18:11.960
- No.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.136
Because it's not true.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.447
My husband is lying.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.667
- How do you know that?

18:23.711 --> 18:25.104
- Because Francis Fuller

18:25.147 --> 18:28.107
sold his stake in the property
last year,

18:28.150 --> 18:30.674
and the deal
immediately imploded.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.677
And I only know
because his wife told me.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.202
- So he assumed that
he could get away with the lie.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.596
And he doesn't know
that you know?

18:39.640 --> 18:42.556
- No,
because we never discussed it.

18:42.599 --> 18:46.995
It was my money that he lost,
and...

18:47.038 --> 18:49.345
I didn't want
to emasculate him.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.567
Get those warrants.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.136
Any and all
that a judge will allow.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.579
- We executed warrants
on Roger Briggs' phone,

19:05.622 --> 19:08.321
home, office, his laptops,
his desk computer.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.670
We're also searching the club.
- And?

19:09.713 --> 19:11.672
- So far, nothing we can use.
He's clean.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.021
No contact
with any of the girls.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.196
No texts.
No emails.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.328
- What about his financials?

19:15.371 --> 19:17.591
- Well,
most of Roger's accounts

19:17.634 --> 19:19.070
are shared with Maxwell.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.377
His personal accounts
barely have any funds at all.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.336
- Well, he could have
hidden assets overseas, right?

19:23.379 --> 19:24.554
- That's gonna
take more digging.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.729
- Muncy.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.209
- What about
the club's financials?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.689
- There's over
a thousand members.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.039
We're still sorting through
withdrawals and deposits,

19:31.082 --> 19:34.260
but these guys are putting up
a Nantucket red wasp wall.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.000
- I'll get you subpoenas
for every member's financials

19:36.044 --> 19:37.088
if I have to.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.220
- You're not gonna
need to do that.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.048
Units just went
through Roger's locker

19:40.091 --> 19:41.310
at the club.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.269
- What'd they find?

19:43.312 --> 19:46.707
- We found nude photos
of all three girls

19:46.750 --> 19:49.362
in a Dopp kit
in Roger's locker.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.407
- Well, that's absurd.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.279
I mean, they were planted.

19:53.322 --> 19:56.847
- Please shut up, Roger.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
Are you here to arrest him?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.504
- I'm sorry.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.898
- We came alone.
There'll be no perp walk.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.987
We'll take him to Central,
book him to the back entrance.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.381
- No press, no cuffs.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
We'll do this
as discreetly as possible.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.081
- No, no, I'm not
going anywhere with you.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.388
- Yes, you are and quietly.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.259
And you're gonna
keep your mouth shut until--

20:17.303 --> 20:18.695
- Until what, Lorraine?

20:18.739 --> 20:22.046
Till you divorce me
so you can save your own ass?

20:22.090 --> 20:24.658
- Until I figure out
what to do.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.400
- Let's go.

20:37.279 --> 20:37.714
.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.195
- I can't believe this guy's
just a schlubby teacher.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.327
- After you left Juárez,
what was he doing?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.893
- I mean, I heard stories.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.895
As far as I know,
he stayed loyal to the cartel

20:44.939 --> 20:46.506
and put in more work.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.813
- So who knows how many bodies
this guy has on him?

20:49.857 --> 20:52.163
- Yeah, but now look at him.

20:55.602 --> 20:58.039
- Don't forget why we're here.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.910
- Excuse me for wanting
to do a little more digging

20:59.954 --> 21:01.738
before I ruin someone's life.

21:04.132 --> 21:05.307
- How bad is it?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.527
- The girls confirmed
that the Polaroids

21:07.570 --> 21:09.311
were taken
without their knowledge.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.661
- And did they say
that Roger used the photos

21:11.705 --> 21:12.749
to threaten them?

21:12.793 --> 21:15.622
- Fuller insinuated as much.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.799
- So you have an E felony
at best,

21:18.842 --> 21:21.236
possession
of child pornography.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.414
- I'll be arraigning Roger
in an hour.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.112
Now, obviously, I can't ban
the press from the courtroom,

21:28.156 --> 21:30.114
but I will expedite
as quickly as possible.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.421
- Thank you so much
for the courtesy heads-up.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.031
- Of course.

21:36.817 --> 21:41.691
- Lorraine, I'm so sorry
about all of this.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.389
- Mm, you know,

21:43.432 --> 21:47.741
when I had the courage
to finally leave my ex-husband,

21:47.784 --> 21:49.612
the settlement
that I was left with

21:49.656 --> 21:51.701
was more money
than I could ever spend,

21:51.745 --> 21:55.836
and Roger has no money
of his own.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.535
I actually pay him
a monthly allowance.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.972
- Huh.

22:02.016 --> 22:05.585
- Am I somehow to blame
for all of this?

22:05.628 --> 22:08.196
- Absolutely not.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.069
Lorraine, I know
that you've already been

22:12.113 --> 22:16.335
through one abusive marriage,
but that wasn't your fault,

22:16.378 --> 22:18.249
and neither is this.

22:18.293 --> 22:23.037
Roger's choices are his
and his alone.

22:24.604 --> 22:28.782
- You always speak
with such conviction, Olivia.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.306
I wish I could believe you now.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.183
- Roger Briggs
on three counts

22:39.227 --> 22:42.012
of possessing an obscene
sexual performance by a child.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.232
How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.451
- People on bail.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.496
- We request 150,000.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.977
- My client is looking forward
to defending himself.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.414
And given his family ties,
it's highly unlikely

22:52.458 --> 22:54.416
that he'd cause the court
any embarrassment.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.941
- Even so,
I am setting bail at 50,000.

22:57.985 --> 23:01.031
Bailiff. Next case.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.033
- We have a lot
to talk about, Counselor.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.731
- Yeah.
Why don't you go first?

23:04.774 --> 23:06.341
- You'll never make
sex trafficking charges.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.560
- Yeah?
- And those Polaroids,

23:07.603 --> 23:08.778
the girls consented to them.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.998
Not to mention
the definition of obscene

23:11.041 --> 23:12.391
is a legally moving target.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.175
- Why don't we let a jury
decide that?

23:14.218 --> 23:16.046
Unless you're willing
to talk deal.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.308
- Why would I do that?

23:17.352 --> 23:19.093
- To spare everyone
the pain of a trial.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.574
- Including Lorraine Maxwell?

23:21.617 --> 23:23.532
Going after the boss' husband.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.882
I give you credit for chutzpah.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.189
There a promotion
in this for you?

23:29.756 --> 23:31.627
- We've met a few times,
Mr. Blumfeld,

23:31.671 --> 23:34.804
and I'll admit that
I don't know you very well,

23:34.848 --> 23:37.851
but you apparently
don't know me at all.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.115
Have a nice day.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.426
- All right,
we followed these two here.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.470
Now what's your plan?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.516
- I'm thinking.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.865
- I checked with the FBI.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.257
We can get
an unlawful flight warrant.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.130
- How about
I just talk to him, OK?

24:08.403 --> 24:09.970
Hey, Chili.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.278
- I know you?

24:14.322 --> 24:16.150
- Anyone else calls you that?

24:17.804 --> 24:19.806
- It's time
to relieve the sitter.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.372
- You got a kid?

24:21.416 --> 24:25.507
- All right, that's it.
Let's go.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.291
- It's OK, honey.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.598
I gotta sit here
and talk to my friend,

24:29.642 --> 24:33.167
'cause it doesn't seem
like I got a choice.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.877
It's Anthony Santini now.
- Santini.

24:47.921 --> 24:51.011
What, have you become Italian
since the last time I saw you?

24:51.054 --> 24:53.100
- It looks like
you became a cop.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.189
- Look, I'm not here
to mess anyone's life up.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.321
- No?
- I just want to talk to you.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.759
- You don't say.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.369
You think I'm stupid?

25:04.590 --> 25:07.418
- No gun, no cuffs.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.465
I'm not here to arrest anyone,
if that's what you're thinking.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.903
- All the same,
I don't like talking to cops.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.427
- OK.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.647
Well, how about you talk
to that scared little boy

25:18.691 --> 25:20.127
back in Juárez?

25:24.523 --> 25:27.656
- You mean my partner?

25:27.700 --> 25:29.832
My friend?

25:29.876 --> 25:31.660
- 'Cause I'll tell you,

25:31.704 --> 25:34.968
he's never gonna forget what
you did for him that night.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.932
- I'm glad to hear it.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.632
- You're not taking the plea?

25:46.675 --> 25:48.155
With what they have,

25:48.198 --> 25:51.332
you would get minimum jail time
or maybe even probation.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.639
- I'm not guilty, Lorraine.

25:53.682 --> 25:59.558
- Roger, do me the courtesy
of not lying to my face.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.909
Given the weight
of what you could be facing,

26:02.952 --> 26:05.041
I would say
that it's a fair deal.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.957
- Fair?
I can't go to prison.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.090
- Roger, it would be
for a few months.

26:10.133 --> 26:13.006
But if they can make
those trafficking charges,

26:13.049 --> 26:14.747
there's not a DA in the country

26:14.790 --> 26:16.226
who would waive jail time
for that.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.359
- But they'll never
make those charges stick.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.579
And we both know
those girls won't testify.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.324
OK, OK, OK, OK.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.850
I can't tell you how sorry I am

26:30.893 --> 26:34.201
I have put you
in this position.

26:34.244 --> 26:38.422
I just wanted
to make my own way for once.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.164
- Are you so delusional
that you actually believe that?

26:41.208 --> 26:42.688
- You're only angry
because it's the first time

26:42.731 --> 26:45.125
I haven't had to crawl to you
begging for money.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.606
- [laughs]
This discussion is over.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.433
- Lorraine, please.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.480
I need you
to make this go away.

26:52.523 --> 26:55.614
- Even if I could put my finger
on the scale for you right now,

26:55.657 --> 26:57.267
I would not.
- Then I have no choice

26:57.311 --> 26:59.443
but to see this through
to trial.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.185
Imagine the chaos.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.145
Front page of "The Times"
every day for months.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.582
What would
the eighth floor say?

27:07.626 --> 27:11.542
I promise you, if I go down,
you'll go down with me.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.763
- I don't even know
who you are.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.765
- I'm the man you love.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.027
Remember?

27:19.812 --> 27:22.684
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

27:27.384 --> 27:30.649
- We were just little morritos

27:30.692 --> 27:33.042
trying to put food
on the table.

27:34.478 --> 27:38.221
- I do not miss those days.

27:38.265 --> 27:41.529
- I don't think about it much.

27:41.572 --> 27:44.488
I keep those memories
where they belong--

27:44.532 --> 27:47.230
in the past.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.015
At least I try.

27:51.017 --> 27:54.673
- Well, I'm not gonna lie.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.677
I can't stop them
from creeping into my present.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.027
- Why?

28:01.070 --> 28:02.724
Hey.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.118
You didn't do anything.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.729
- You're right.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.951
But I still had my gun pointed
at the father's chest.

28:11.994 --> 28:16.216
He was trembling.

28:16.259 --> 28:19.175
Remember, that's when he said--

28:19.219 --> 28:23.049
- "No, por favor."

28:23.092 --> 28:26.356
- And then the son comes in.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.881
He looks right at us.

28:28.924 --> 28:31.057
- That's when you froze.

28:34.582 --> 28:39.848
- I never thanked you
for covering for me that night.

28:39.892 --> 28:42.372
- I did what I did--

28:42.416 --> 28:44.331
what I had to do...

28:45.767 --> 28:48.248
Or we both would
have been dealt with.

28:56.169 --> 28:59.085
- So how did you get
all the way up here?

29:01.043 --> 29:02.218
- It's a long story.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.612
- [chuckles]

29:18.713 --> 29:23.457
- Well, brother,
I got nothing but time.

29:31.813 --> 29:32.031
.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.033
- So we're
just going home empty-handed?

29:34.076 --> 29:35.512
- Will you just leave it alone?

29:35.556 --> 29:38.167
- Benson is not gonna be happy
with either one of us.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.041
- I guess you don't
know me that well yet,

29:42.084 --> 29:43.738
do you, Chimney?

29:46.567 --> 29:49.918
- I whacked a few more dealers
after that night.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.312
You heard about the
drive-through motel massacre

29:52.355 --> 29:54.270
in El Centro?

29:54.314 --> 29:56.403
- Yeah.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.926
- That was me.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.712
- You know what that is, right?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.845
- Evidence.
- Yep.

30:03.889 --> 30:07.762
And to get it, I took a page
out of your playbook.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.766
[phone buzzing]

30:11.810 --> 30:13.855
I gotta get this.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.732
Hey, Captain.

30:23.604 --> 30:24.997
Yeah.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.783
We got--we got what we needed.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.699
We're about to head home.
Yeah.

30:31.742 --> 30:34.136
- Hang up and get in the van.

30:36.356 --> 30:37.836
- I gotta go.

30:42.057 --> 30:45.495
- Saw you play an audio file
for your partner in there.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.542
I want to hear it.

30:48.585 --> 30:49.891
Play it.
- Now, listen--

30:49.935 --> 30:51.806
- I said, play it!

30:55.114 --> 30:57.116
- Let's just say
I did a good job

30:57.159 --> 30:59.596
and they gave me
a lot of work after that.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.555
But I found God.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.209
I talked all this through
with him,

31:03.252 --> 31:04.601
made things right with Jesus.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.473
He forgives me.

31:06.516 --> 31:09.432
And I'm asking you
to forgive me as well.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.784
- Give me your phone.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.396
- I can't do that.

31:16.439 --> 31:19.486
- You see that place?

31:19.529 --> 31:21.836
It's where me and Anthony met.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.099
He was a busboy.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.493
I knew he was running
from something.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.669
- And that didn't bother you?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.584
- Put his head down.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.674
And he worked hard,
and he went back to school.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.894
- So you helped him change.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.809
- I believed he could.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.685
So give me your phone.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.339
- Now, listen to me,

31:46.382 --> 31:49.646
I've looked down
the barrel of a gun before.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.867
I've seen the look of somebody
who's gonna pull the trigger.

31:56.305 --> 31:59.482
That's not you.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.223
You're not a killer.

32:03.965 --> 32:07.012
But your husband was.

32:07.055 --> 32:10.537
- No, he wasn't my Anthony
back then.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.365
- I know. I know.

32:12.408 --> 32:15.716
- Please, please, please.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.023
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.546
- I'm so sorry.
- Please.

32:19.589 --> 32:22.766
[sobbing]

32:37.303 --> 32:38.782
- You're home.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.831
- Roger, this is not happening.

32:43.874 --> 32:48.531
- Well, we never did get that
anniversary dinner, did we?

32:48.575 --> 32:50.011
A promise is a promise.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.752
- You're drunk.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.102
- You always know me so well.

32:55.495 --> 32:59.281
I'm offering an olive branch,
Lorraine.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.022
Please.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.372
Please sit down.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.244
- I don't think so.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.770
But I will have a drink.

33:09.813 --> 33:12.294
- That's my girl.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.740
- Thank you.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.091
- You're welcome.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.570
Whatever else
our problems were,

33:27.614 --> 33:30.834
we always managed to have fun,
didn't we?

33:31.835 --> 33:34.795
- Yes, we did.

33:34.838 --> 33:37.972
- Um, one bite?

33:38.016 --> 33:39.843
I put a lot into this.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.845
- [chuckles]
You actually cooked?

33:41.889 --> 33:43.673
I'm afraid to look
in the kitchen.

33:43.717 --> 33:48.113
- DoorDash from Saint
Sebastian's, your favorite.

33:48.156 --> 33:51.072
- I don't think so.
Good night, Roger.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.727
- But you don't know
what you're missing.

33:53.770 --> 33:56.208
All I wanted was to have
one more nice meal together.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.992
Is that so much to ask?

33:58.036 --> 34:00.560
- Yes, it is.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.649
- You know,
your ex-husband was right,

34:02.692 --> 34:06.044
the way he kept you in line,
humiliated you.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.047
And I think you deserved it.

34:09.090 --> 34:13.529
You're such a castrating bitch.

34:13.572 --> 34:16.532
[choking]

35:02.491 --> 35:04.406

[dialing]

35:13.763 --> 35:15.374
[line trilling]

35:15.417 --> 35:17.680
- 911.
What's your emergency?

35:17.724 --> 35:20.118
- My husband is choking.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.512
Send someone right away,
please.

35:38.745 --> 35:38.919
.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.182
- Roger Briggs choked
to death last night?

35:41.226 --> 35:42.357
How am I just hearing
about this now?

35:42.401 --> 35:43.271
- Because I figured
that you could use

35:43.315 --> 35:45.578
at least
one good night of sleep.

35:45.621 --> 35:46.883
Carisi, there's nothing
that you could have done.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.581
- Well, what the hell happened?

35:48.624 --> 35:50.626
Was he alone?
- Apparently.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.499
Maxwell came home and found him
lying on the floor.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.543
She called 911.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.197
- Jesus.
Is she OK?

35:56.241 --> 35:58.634
- What do you think?

35:58.678 --> 36:00.941
- You don't want to know
what I think.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.248
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.423
- Carisi, what does that mean?

36:04.466 --> 36:06.381
- Just...

36:06.425 --> 36:09.863
You don't think the timing
is just a little convenient?

36:09.906 --> 36:12.387
I mean,
was this divine intervention?

36:12.431 --> 36:16.217
- The ME ruled it accidental.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.566
- OK. OK.

36:17.610 --> 36:21.831
So, uh, this was
just a tragic accident.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.007
Is that what you think?

36:24.051 --> 36:28.838
- I think that this is
a tragedy all around.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.234
- Shouldn't you be at home?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.758
Shift doesn't start
for another few hours.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.586
- I had some stuff to get done.

36:39.545 --> 36:43.113
- So you knew I'd be giving
Chili's confession to Benson,

36:43.157 --> 36:46.334
and you what--
you wanted to watch?

36:46.378 --> 36:47.770
Want me
to get you some popcorn?

36:47.814 --> 36:50.338
- I didn't come for snacks
or the sanctimony.

36:50.382 --> 36:51.774
- So why are you here?

36:51.818 --> 36:54.777
- I came
to make sure you're OK.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.439
- Well, since you are here,

37:04.483 --> 37:06.876
I, uh--

37:06.920 --> 37:08.922
I stopped
at a scout supply store.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.489
I was gonna leave this
on your desk.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.448
[laughs]

37:13.492 --> 37:16.625
- You got me
a Girl Scout merit badge?

37:16.669 --> 37:18.714
- It's for service.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.154
I couldn't have done this
without you.

37:24.198 --> 37:27.201
- Yeah you could have.
You just wouldn't have.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.509
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Yeah.

37:30.552 --> 37:33.033
[laughs]
- You want some coffee?

37:38.081 --> 37:41.302
- You're back.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.826
How did it go?

37:43.870 --> 37:45.524
- I recorded the guy.

37:45.567 --> 37:48.309
- Without his knowledge?

37:48.353 --> 37:50.268
Well, that's illegal in Maine.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.965
- Well, he copped to
a hit in California

37:52.008 --> 37:53.314
and another one in Arizona--

37:53.358 --> 37:55.055
both unsolved.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.977
- And how do you feel?

38:04.020 --> 38:07.676
- Like I did the right thing.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.330
I still feel pretty bad.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.940
- Now.

38:10.984 --> 38:14.770
But you unburdened yourself,
Velasco.

38:14.814 --> 38:18.339
And eventually, that's--

38:18.383 --> 38:21.255
that's gonna feel really good.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.869
- What are you gonna do
with it?

38:26.913 --> 38:28.306
- Well, I'm gonna listen to it,

38:28.349 --> 38:32.919
and then I'm gonna decide
who to share it with next.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.706
But it's out of your hands now.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.542
- Are we good?

38:47.586 --> 38:50.110
- We're good.

39:04.559 --> 39:07.823
- He had dinner all laid out,
and he'd been waiting for me.

39:07.867 --> 39:10.739
And--and then he was
just lying on the floor.

39:10.783 --> 39:13.960
- And he was already dead.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.311
- Well, he--
he started choking.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.969
- And you couldn't help him?

39:23.012 --> 39:27.016
- I tried, but there
was nothing I could do.

39:28.801 --> 39:31.891
- Well, it sounds like
you did everything right.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.284
You called 911 immediately.

39:36.069 --> 39:38.027
- You checked the call log?

39:40.726 --> 39:42.858
- I did.

39:42.902 --> 39:47.341
- I loved him, you know,
despite everything.

39:51.606 --> 39:54.043
Do you believe me?

39:57.482 --> 40:00.485
- Whether I do or not,

40:00.528 --> 40:03.270
there's no proof
to the contrary.

40:05.403 --> 40:09.798
- So just another one
of our stalemates.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.105
- Well, it still has
to be investigated.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.107
- No, of course.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.978
Should your investigation
come up

40:16.022 --> 40:17.806
with anything other
than what I've told you...

40:17.850 --> 40:19.895
- You'll be the first to know.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.074
- So we have an understanding.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.256
- Justice may be blind,
Lorraine,

40:33.300 --> 40:37.870
but it's not
entirely heartless.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.920
However, you--

40:44.964 --> 40:50.056
you will see
how heartless I can be

40:50.099 --> 40:53.668
if this conversation
ever comes back to haunt me.
