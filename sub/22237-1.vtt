00:01.734 --> 00:04.059
I cast a spell
to make Oscar walk again.

00:04.090 --> 00:06.326
I didn't know
it would unmake all of us.

00:06.346 --> 00:08.764
Everything is exactly like home,
but it's not.

00:08.785 --> 00:10.857
Like a different version
of the same reality.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.251
Did we go out in your world?

00:12.272 --> 00:14.854
Unfortunately, in my world,
I kind of disgust you.

00:14.875 --> 00:17.878
When you see the other me,
show her this; it belonged to my Nan.

00:17.899 --> 00:20.892
This is special. It can protect
against elemental attacks.

00:20.913 --> 00:24.679
There are four worldly elements -
Earth, Fire, Air and Water,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.797
and then a fifth element - Spirit.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.427
Oscar is the fifth element.

00:28.448 --> 00:30.107
There's a demon trying to kill us.

00:30.128 --> 00:34.614
A restoring demon, created to restore the
natural order after a magical disturbance.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.107
Ten years ago,
my sister Alice disappeared.

00:37.128 --> 00:38.522
- Phoebe.
- Alice!

00:38.543 --> 00:40.547
Order must be restored.

00:40.679 --> 00:42.183
The original unmaking spell!

00:42.205 --> 00:45.057
If we cast it again, everything will
go back to the way it was.

00:45.076 --> 00:47.022
* Walk upon this earth again *

00:47.043 --> 00:48.178
We're home!

00:48.199 --> 00:51.686
Mr Bates dropped in to see me a few times
while you were gone. He's a lovely man.

00:51.707 --> 00:52.836
Bates?

I can feel it.

She's here.

<i>This is Michelle Keats
reporting live from Bremin</i>

02:10.139 --> 02:12.877
<i>with a story that has
captivated the country.</i>

02:12.898 --> 02:15.414
<i>After two weeks missing
in rugged terrain,</i>

02:15.435 --> 02:17.380
<i>the Bremin Four have returned,</i>

02:17.401 --> 02:20.483
<i>and they're about to make
their first media appearance.</i>

02:20.504 --> 02:23.690
<i>Will we finally hear the truth about
what happened to them?</i>

02:23.753 --> 02:28.200
<i>There has been some speculation
already that it may all be a hoax.</i>

02:29.996 --> 02:34.767
Wormholes, alternate universes,
magic -

02:34.928 --> 02:38.229
they all exist, and I have proof.

02:38.555 --> 02:40.197
Watch.

02:53.734 --> 02:57.266
I can't believe they want you
to talk to the press right now.

02:57.286 --> 02:59.470
We get it over with
and they'll leave us alone.

02:59.491 --> 03:01.386
- Hello!
- Hello!

03:01.484 --> 03:04.044
The superstar's father
is in the building!

03:04.568 --> 03:07.521
- You want a coffee?
- Yeah, I haven't had breakfast.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.061
Oh, well, help yourself.

03:10.992 --> 03:12.648
You're coming to watch, right?

03:13.156 --> 03:15.964
- 'Cause I'm gonna mention you.
- Please don't.

03:16.083 --> 03:19.457
Look: there's been so much going on right
now, we haven't had a chance to talk.

03:19.478 --> 03:22.526
- We can talk at the party tomorrow.
- What party?

03:22.565 --> 03:25.708
Our official welcome-home.
Vince organised it.

03:26.001 --> 03:28.938
I know I was a terrible boyfriend before,

03:29.176 --> 03:32.651
but I'm the new and
improved Sam; you'll see.

03:44.038 --> 03:47.899
There you are!
Come on - tuck your shirt in.

03:48.246 --> 03:49.806
This is national TV.

03:49.843 --> 03:52.436
- You know what you're going to say?
- Yes, Mum.

03:52.555 --> 03:55.461
You're home. You're home!

03:55.548 --> 03:57.480
Oh, you're home!

03:57.500 --> 03:59.884
We'll all be watching
from the front row.

04:00.412 --> 04:01.658
OK...

04:02.064 --> 04:03.327
This is it.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.834
- Everyone's gonna be looking at us.
- I know...

04:05.855 --> 04:09.516
- This is our chance to tell the world...
- We're not telling the world anything.

04:09.536 --> 04:12.268
- We're going to be legends.
- No, really, I mean it.

04:12.289 --> 04:16.148
- Magic has to be kept a secret.
- Dude, chill. This is gonna be sweet.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.488
One at a time! Please.

04:26.508 --> 04:30.488
Andy, is there anything you want to say
to the people who searched for you?

04:30.930 --> 04:33.982
Wormholes, alternate universes...

04:34.002 --> 04:36.532
- They all exist.
- What he means is, um...

04:36.552 --> 04:39.183
Thank you to everyone
who didn't give up on us.

04:39.204 --> 04:41.035
We wouldn't be here without you.

04:41.056 --> 04:42.860
But how did you survive?

04:42.881 --> 04:44.552
Jake, what did you eat?

04:44.568 --> 04:47.255
Um, we ate...

04:47.504 --> 04:49.036
What did we eat?

04:49.778 --> 04:52.830
We found, ah, berries...?

04:52.851 --> 04:56.641
And we ate Andy's pawpaw ointment.

04:57.277 --> 05:00.848
It was thinking of my girlfriend,
Mia, that got me through.

05:00.908 --> 05:04.059
I was pretty scared,
but I couldn't give up.

05:04.154 --> 05:08.279
How do you boys explain the fact you have
no symptoms of dehydration or exposure?

05:08.331 --> 05:10.741
It all comes down to
transdimensional quantum physics.

05:10.767 --> 05:13.119
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

05:13.707 --> 05:16.767
You survived in the forest
because... physics?

05:16.788 --> 05:20.022
We survived
because we stuck together.

05:20.043 --> 05:22.267
We didn't go off on our own.

05:22.396 --> 05:26.778
But that still doesn't explain why
the search party found no sign of you.

05:28.394 --> 05:31.551
Do you want me
to repeat the question?

05:31.949 --> 05:33.199
Felix...?

05:33.679 --> 05:35.053
Sorry, what?

05:35.082 --> 05:38.523
Why didn't anyone find any
trace of you in the forest?

05:38.726 --> 05:41.393
No fire, no shelter, no tracks, nothing?

05:41.488 --> 05:46.944
Um, I'm not sure. Maybe they weren't
looking in the right place.

05:46.985 --> 05:51.401
Helicopters were scouring the area
as well as search parties on the ground.

05:54.267 --> 05:58.300
If you weren't actually in trouble,
the resources wasted would be...

05:59.798 --> 06:02.511
- Earthquake!
- Take shelter!

06:05.540 --> 06:07.544
That way, that way.

06:09.109 --> 06:12.077
We have to get out of here.
Come on!

06:17.219 --> 06:20.019
What was that?
Bremin is not on any fault lines.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.543
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I couldn't help it.

06:22.687 --> 06:25.667
Whoa, hang on. Since when could you
make the ground shake?

06:25.683 --> 06:27.607
Since we got back.

06:27.628 --> 06:30.360
Whenever I turn a tap on,
the water goes crazy.

06:30.381 --> 06:33.373
I sneezed and made
the washing line spin around.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.947
Crossing universes. Maybe it's
giving us elemental powers somehow.

06:36.968 --> 06:39.948
You're fire, right?
You must have a fire power.

06:40.631 --> 06:43.777
I'll show you, but not here.
We need to get out of sight.

06:43.798 --> 06:45.759
- Our parents are gonna kill us.
- Come on!

06:45.780 --> 06:47.930
<i>This morning's press
conference was interrupted</i>

06:47.951 --> 06:51.671
<i>by an unusual seismic disturbance
that has yet to be explai...</i>

06:55.631 --> 06:57.683
No! Come on.

06:58.328 --> 06:59.757
Stupid thing.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.101
Hello...?

07:21.687 --> 07:23.076
Hello?

07:26.970 --> 07:28.417
Alice?

07:30.679 --> 07:32.174
Alice?

07:32.349 --> 07:33.651
Alice!

07:39.132 --> 07:41.683
Superheroes need superhero names.

07:41.721 --> 07:45.729
You could be "Jake the Quake"
and you could be "Wet Andy".

07:45.750 --> 07:48.342
That would make you "Airhead".

07:48.363 --> 07:51.528
Look - the same as
in the other universe.

07:51.662 --> 07:54.006
OK, show us your stuff.

08:06.805 --> 08:08.781
Seriously awesome, dude.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.479
Spontaneous combustion.

08:14.615 --> 08:16.420
You can control it.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.419
- Kind of.
- How do you do that?

08:21.155 --> 08:25.187
My mum. Uh-oh. I think
they've noticed we're gone.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.340
Again.

08:26.861 --> 08:28.873
- I should go home.
- No!

08:28.989 --> 08:30.469
We have to stick together.

08:30.497 --> 08:33.054
Dude, we're home now.
Nothing is chasing us.

08:33.076 --> 08:36.566
- Alice is here. I saw her.
- The restoring demon?

08:36.587 --> 08:37.717
How?

08:37.738 --> 08:40.722
She must have come through
somehow when we did.

08:40.744 --> 08:43.744
What for? There's no restoring
to do. We belong here.

08:43.765 --> 08:47.002
The talisman doesn't.
You still have it, don't you?

08:47.023 --> 08:49.117
Sorry, I'm not just gonna hand it over.

08:49.138 --> 08:52.129
- It's the only thing that can protect us.
- Our powers can protect us.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.392
- You can't even control them.
- Then show us how!

08:54.413 --> 08:56.433
You kind of owe us, Felix.

08:59.675 --> 09:03.086
You're really here.
Where were you?

09:03.107 --> 09:06.087
It doesn't matter.
You can tell me later.

09:07.510 --> 09:09.558
Let me take you to the doctor.

09:09.605 --> 09:11.390
The magic shop...

09:11.695 --> 09:13.166
They closed it.

09:13.802 --> 09:18.264
- My things...
- Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.

09:19.655 --> 09:23.456
- I need the Book of Shadows.
- No, you need to sleep.

09:25.262 --> 09:26.644
You're safe now.

09:26.683 --> 09:29.895
- No...
- Rest, just rest. Ssh.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.577
Want me to pull your finger?

10:02.611 --> 10:06.059
- Maybe I need to sneeze.
- There might be a physical trigger.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.663
Gross, dude! You're supposed
to be aiming for the can.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.315
There must be a process.

10:13.336 --> 10:17.015
Every action has a reaction.
Tell us how you do it.

10:17.036 --> 10:21.016
I don't know <i>how</i> I do it.
How do you catch a football?

10:21.042 --> 10:25.378
- I hold out my arms, and I catch.
- I tried that once. Didn't work.

10:26.908 --> 10:30.208
If magic is like science,
then it can be learned.

10:30.675 --> 10:33.695
- How did you make the ground shake?
- I don't know.

10:36.378 --> 10:38.668
I saw Bates with my mum,
and that freaked me out.

10:38.689 --> 10:42.559
OK... Try remembering
that feeling, harnessing it.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.405
OK.

10:44.612 --> 10:45.937
OK...

10:51.417 --> 10:56.244
And remember - kiss me again,
Mr Bates!

10:56.651 --> 10:58.115
Keep doing that.

10:58.184 --> 11:02.208
Ooh, Mr Bates, I love you!
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

11:04.013 --> 11:05.791
You're doing it!

11:08.477 --> 11:10.593
Hey, did you guys see that?

11:10.893 --> 11:12.378
OK, my turn!

11:31.281 --> 11:33.909
Did you see that? Yeah!

11:34.105 --> 11:36.482
Come on, Andy. Your turn, mate.

11:37.146 --> 11:38.353
You ready?

11:43.176 --> 11:45.065
Focus, Andy.

11:46.445 --> 11:49.204
Go for the can, go for the can!

11:49.691 --> 11:51.416
Concentrate...

11:51.484 --> 11:52.741
Aw, dude!

11:57.683 --> 12:01.143
I know what we can call him now -
Drip Boy.

12:01.599 --> 12:03.679
You have to try using
the power of your mind.

12:03.695 --> 12:06.218
I have an IQ of 144!

12:06.239 --> 12:08.476
I use the power of my mind
more than any of you!

12:08.497 --> 12:10.461
Yeah, our powers can barely
defeat tin cans.

12:10.482 --> 12:13.207
No way we're ready for
a restoring demon. Talisman.

12:14.827 --> 12:16.688
I need to come up with a plan.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.950
- We could help.
- Yes, you could!

12:18.971 --> 12:23.206
No more talk of alternate universes and
magical wormholes. THAT will help.

12:36.369 --> 12:39.487
He needs food and rest,
not decoration for his room.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.875
- My mother give this to me. I put it up.
- It's a silly superstition.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.397
It will protect from the evil spirits.

12:45.418 --> 12:47.616
I don't need protecting, Nainai.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.381
- Ow!
- Yes, you do, you silly boy.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.973
- Eat something.
- Mum, we just had dinner.

12:51.994 --> 12:55.452
- Eat!
- I'm fine too, if anyone's interested.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.376
Come on, Mum.

13:07.962 --> 13:10.561
You don't all have to check on me
every ten minutes.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.158
Yes, we do. When you have kids,
you'll understand.

13:13.179 --> 13:16.187
I'm not a kid!
I can take care of myself.

13:16.364 --> 13:17.715
I can do...

13:18.691 --> 13:20.100
Stuff.

13:22.454 --> 13:24.482
What is this really about?

13:24.829 --> 13:27.225
I don't want to be Nerdy Andy, Dad.

13:28.131 --> 13:32.365
I guess I was what they would call
nerdy when I was your age...

13:32.535 --> 13:34.970
But look at me now!

13:36.691 --> 13:38.513
Thanks, Dad.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.372
Goodnight, son.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.165
Mum's ready to kill you.

14:16.379 --> 14:18.793
The happy-to-have-me-back look
has worn off?

14:18.844 --> 14:21.688
I've been practising my power,
trying to find Alice.

14:22.068 --> 14:24.040
What I really need is Phoebe.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.246
She will know what to do.

14:27.663 --> 14:32.206
While you were gone, I couldn't help with
the search, and I had to do something.

14:36.392 --> 14:38.465
__

14:38.493 --> 14:40.025
You drew this?

14:42.725 --> 14:44.252
__

14:49.046 --> 14:51.031
This is amazing, Oskie.

14:51.169 --> 14:52.888
I love it.

14:54.365 --> 14:56.884
__

14:57.927 --> 15:00.914
- How did you know about this?
- I don't know.

15:01.063 --> 15:02.833
But this really happened.

15:03.432 --> 15:05.552
I just drew what was in my head.

15:18.881 --> 15:21.084
Reckon you can
draw where Phoebe is?

15:21.575 --> 15:23.210
I can try.

16:03.286 --> 16:06.187
I won't let anything
happen to you again.

16:06.394 --> 16:08.041
I promise.

16:22.879 --> 16:25.184
Looks like Phoebe has
thrown everything out.

16:32.484 --> 16:33.584
You ready?

16:33.723 --> 16:36.214
I don't know if I can
get an exact address.

16:39.905 --> 16:41.542
It's coming.

16:42.647 --> 16:44.398
Anything?

16:44.679 --> 16:46.231
She's afraid.

16:47.470 --> 16:48.764
Hang on.

16:49.566 --> 16:52.720
'All deliveries to 100 Stuckey Lane.'
Found her.

16:53.818 --> 16:55.466
Let's get the others.

17:05.082 --> 17:06.733
- Anything?
- Nothing.

17:09.659 --> 17:13.089
Look - it's me, skating over
the bins. How did you do this?

17:13.109 --> 17:15.864
Oscar is Spirit in that universe
and this one.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.808
So you've got a power? Way to go.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.119
There she is.

17:21.797 --> 17:24.753
You really think she's gonna
tell us how to defeat her sister?

17:24.775 --> 17:26.431
Only one way to find out.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.116
Phoebe?

17:32.262 --> 17:33.564
Phoebe?

17:34.241 --> 17:35.401
Hello?

17:37.873 --> 17:40.651
Uh, private property.
What are you doing in here?

17:40.667 --> 17:42.089
We need your help.

17:42.619 --> 17:44.842
You used to slink around my shop.

17:45.018 --> 17:48.187
The rest of you, I've never met.
You want help, try your parents.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.199
Dude, she doesn't know us
in this universe.

17:50.222 --> 17:52.769
And there is no universe in which
I wanna know you; move it!

17:52.790 --> 17:54.570
- Wait, can we just...
- Your sister is a demon.

17:54.591 --> 17:57.276
- Alice tried to kill us.
- She was in this hurricane thing...

17:57.296 --> 17:58.637
What...?

17:58.728 --> 18:02.549
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

18:03.495 --> 18:07.800
Water, Fire, Earth and Air,
elements that we all share.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.607
- What is that?
- Water, Fire, Earth and Air,

18:10.628 --> 18:12.137
elements that we all share.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.120
- OK, bad teenage poetry is the last straw.
- It's not glowing.

18:15.141 --> 18:17.309
- So there's no danger?
- I don't understand it.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.104
Creepy boy
and your forest friends - out.

18:20.373 --> 18:22.071
Get out!

18:22.864 --> 18:24.238
Out!

18:28.077 --> 18:30.202
She didn't look like
much of a demon to me.

18:30.223 --> 18:32.453
Yeah: no crows, no bees...

18:32.474 --> 18:35.661
If the talisman didn't glow, that
means she's not a threat, doesn't it?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.614
Maybe the talisman works differently
in this universe.

18:38.643 --> 18:40.307
Maybe it's broken.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.752
Maybe she's just Phoebe's sister,
like she says.

18:42.773 --> 18:46.627
She came back the same time we did.
No way that's a coincidence.

18:46.643 --> 18:48.675
Just let it go, Felix.

18:48.965 --> 18:51.081
We've got a party to get to.

18:55.832 --> 18:57.736
__

19:06.790 --> 19:08.178
Sam!

19:11.667 --> 19:13.147
Felix!

19:14.157 --> 19:15.382
Welcome back!

19:15.663 --> 19:17.631
Move it, nerd!

19:18.719 --> 19:21.999
Hey, the footy team hasn't been
the same without you, bro.

19:23.868 --> 19:25.556
I thought you hated parties.

19:25.589 --> 19:29.340
Loathe and detest them, but
I figured you'd be here.

19:29.371 --> 19:32.882
- We don't have to stay.
- What, and leave your fan club?

19:36.480 --> 19:40.456
Felix, are you and Jake friends now?

19:41.663 --> 19:43.821
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:46.022 --> 19:48.018
Does this mean anything to you?

19:48.377 --> 19:51.653
- It's a necklace.
- Don't you recognise it?

19:52.563 --> 19:54.360
Don't think so.

19:54.389 --> 19:56.638
Someone very cool told me
to give it to you.

19:56.659 --> 19:58.001
Who?

19:58.608 --> 20:00.347
I can't tell you that.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.729
OK.

20:01.906 --> 20:05.570
Wait - it's me.
I want you to have it.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.844
- Why?
- Because...

20:08.245 --> 20:13.493
Because I think you're smart and pretty
and you don't give yourself enough credit.

20:16.981 --> 20:18.895
Thanks for the pep talk.

20:19.569 --> 20:21.026
Bye.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.571
Cool party.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.126
This is the worst party
of my life.

20:30.631 --> 20:34.504
- Hey, you're here!
- It's your welcome-home.

20:34.869 --> 20:36.870
And you wanted to talk, right?

20:37.094 --> 20:39.098
Listen, Sam...

20:39.119 --> 20:40.350
Mia.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.309
Thanks, Lachlan.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.345
Oh, sorry.
I didn't get one for you.

20:44.386 --> 20:47.268
That's OK.
I'll just take this one.

20:53.243 --> 20:56.694
- While you were gone, I...
- Got pretty close with Lachlan...

20:56.715 --> 20:58.274
Obviously.

20:58.448 --> 21:00.409
We're just friends.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.651
I've been meaning to ask you

21:07.671 --> 21:10.225
if you want to go to a movie
this week.

21:10.521 --> 21:14.923
- We go to the movies every week.
- I know. But this would be different.

21:14.944 --> 21:16.996
- How?
- Well...

21:18.536 --> 21:19.867
I'd pay.

21:20.308 --> 21:22.002
You mean, a date?

21:23.569 --> 21:24.774
No.

21:27.213 --> 21:29.226
Yes, you idiot!

21:29.247 --> 21:32.891
- Really?
- It's only taken you 15 years to ask me.

21:35.024 --> 21:37.008
It's not the same Ellen.

21:37.234 --> 21:40.498
I know, but if only she could see
what I can do.

21:40.519 --> 21:44.547
Forget it, Andy. In this universe,
she's not into you.

22:40.850 --> 22:44.526
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Everyone could have seen that.

22:45.103 --> 22:48.115
Haven't you been listening to
a single thing I've been saying?

22:48.319 --> 22:50.049
You knew I liked Ellen!

22:50.070 --> 22:52.102
Hey, Andy, give it back!

23:01.967 --> 23:03.096
What's going on?

23:03.117 --> 23:05.243
Andy took my bag with the Book
of Shadows and the talisman.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.930
- We have to go after him.
- Dude, this is our party.

23:07.951 --> 23:11.080
It's getting closer.
Order must be restored, remember?

23:17.255 --> 23:19.057
<i>They don't listen.</i>

23:19.078 --> 23:20.376
Who said that?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.129
<i>They don't see you.</i>

23:24.044 --> 23:28.521
<i>But you can be strong.
You can control everything.</i>

23:30.687 --> 23:32.659
<i>Use the magic.</i>

23:33.793 --> 23:35.777
<i>You have the power.</i>

23:35.834 --> 23:37.201
__

23:37.222 --> 23:39.819
<i>Quickly! Say the spell.</i>

23:50.462 --> 23:52.173
__

23:52.665 --> 23:55.677
- Andy!
- Andy, where are you?

23:56.517 --> 23:58.517
- Andy!
- Andy?

24:04.858 --> 24:06.846
Andy, what are you doing?

24:06.962 --> 24:09.562
- I can do this!
- Do what?

24:09.676 --> 24:12.674
- You'll see.
- What?

24:13.452 --> 24:17.258
Elements, obey me.
Water, heed my call.

24:17.298 --> 24:19.549
- Andy, stop. You don't know...
- Look!

24:19.570 --> 24:21.894
- Rise and fall.
- The restoring demon!

24:21.915 --> 24:24.572
- Become the power, the source of all.
- Andy!

24:24.593 --> 24:27.384
- Listen to me!
- Andy, stop!

24:27.405 --> 24:29.188
- Andy, no!
- Andy, look at me!

24:29.221 --> 24:30.658
Elements, obey me.

24:30.689 --> 24:33.243
- Water, heed my call.
- Don't do it!

24:33.264 --> 24:35.765
Surround, unleash, rise and fall.

24:35.786 --> 24:38.557
Become the power,
the source of all.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.232
Andy, stop this!
Look at what you're doing!

24:54.327 --> 24:56.375
I have the power now.

24:56.479 --> 24:58.479
I can control the magic.

25:00.513 --> 25:02.501
Andy, watch out!

25:04.165 --> 25:05.623
Andy!

25:05.902 --> 25:08.730
Andy, look out!
Andy, no!

25:09.024 --> 25:11.032
Andy!...

25:19.815 --> 25:21.663
Andy!

25:28.405 --> 25:31.824
- Andy, can you hear me?
- He got sucked into the sky, doofus!

25:31.845 --> 25:34.054
- He could be anywhere.
- What about an unmaking spell?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.740
Maybe a reversal spell.
We need something to sacrifice.

25:36.761 --> 25:38.328
Something Andy really cares about.

25:39.490 --> 25:40.568
Have you seen Sam?

25:40.589 --> 25:42.380
And I'd know where your
boyfriend is because?

25:42.401 --> 25:45.037
Because my boyfriend has
a man crush on your boyfriend.

25:45.058 --> 25:46.975
Felix is not my boyfriend.

25:46.996 --> 25:48.854
- I want to help.
- Why would we trust you?

25:48.875 --> 25:50.739
- You tried to destroy us.
- I'm not a threat.

25:50.752 --> 25:53.602
Element of water, find your power,
take your form.

25:57.342 --> 25:58.597
Andy!
