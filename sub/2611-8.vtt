00:42.433 --> 00:45.686
Adell, what's going on?

00:45.686 --> 00:49.815
Gardener saw a bloody kid all on her own.
Called in at 2:48 P.M.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.400
You get an ID?

00:51.400 --> 00:55.154
Not yet. We're door-to-door every house
on the block expanding the perimeter.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.365
No missing persons?
No car accidents?

00:57.365 --> 00:58.824
Nothing in the immediate area.

00:58.824 --> 01:01.327
Okay. What do you got?

01:01.327 --> 01:03.287
There's not a scratch on her.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.331
Hi.

01:07.124 --> 01:09.794
Well, the blood had to come
from somewhere, didn't it?

01:09.794 --> 01:14.715
My guess is that someone close
to this child is either dead ...

01:14.715 --> 01:15.967
or dying.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.310
I'm going to take this.

02:02.770 --> 02:03.813
Okay.

02:04.396 --> 02:05.689
Hematrace.

02:07.775 --> 02:10.360
Good job.
You are a good girl.

02:14.698 --> 02:15.741
It's human blood.

02:16.784 --> 02:19.078
Okay, and we know
it's not hers, right?

02:20.704 --> 02:22.206
Okay. You know what ...

02:22.206 --> 02:25.334
let's bag the sleeper and get it to Megan.
We need DNA and trace on the fabric.

02:27.211 --> 02:28.254
You ...

02:29.255 --> 02:30.297
are a good girl.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.097
Too much blood for
a casual injury.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.391
How far could she
have possibly walked?

02:40.391 --> 02:41.392
I don't know.

02:41.392 --> 02:44.311
Your average adult has been clocked
at two-and-a-half to three miles per hour,

02:44.311 --> 02:47.273
but to my knowledge, no toddler
has ever been road-tested.

02:47.273 --> 02:51.068
But I'll tell you what I'm more interested
in is that sunburn on the side of her face.

02:51.068 --> 02:53.779
You have a sunburn on
one side of your face ...

02:53.779 --> 02:56.824
it means you've been walking
in a straight line, doesn't it?

02:56.824 --> 03:00.244
Our gardener said she was headed
towards hibiscus avenue.

03:00.244 --> 03:05.458
Hibiscus ... which means
she was traveling due north.

03:17.553 --> 03:18.554
Hey, guys.

03:18.554 --> 03:19.722
Hey.

03:19.722 --> 03:22.433
Everybody's talking
about the bloody child.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.101
Do we even know where
she came from?

03:24.810 --> 03:26.145
That's the question.

03:26.145 --> 03:30.316
This is the answer.
Want a leg or a foot?

03:46.582 --> 03:48.209
Some type of soil.

03:49.251 --> 03:50.836
From any lawn that she crossed?

03:51.378 --> 03:54.090
Well, her feet were
soaked with blood.

03:57.259 --> 03:58.844
Well, that narrows it down.

04:00.429 --> 04:02.640
I'm going to go look at
this for a little while.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.682
Let me know.

04:18.822 --> 04:20.116
Help!

04:26.664 --> 04:31.877
Help! Somebody help!

05:07.913 --> 05:08.956
All right.

05:14.044 --> 05:15.379
Duquesne.

05:15.379 --> 05:18.174
Calleigh, have we gotten anything
off Profiler Plus yet?

05:18.174 --> 05:19.884
Amelogenin's up.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.344
We've got two different bleeders:
One male, one female.

05:22.344 --> 05:23.512
Make that three.

05:23.512 --> 05:24.430
Another male.

05:24.430 --> 05:25.556
Out of how many samples?

05:25.556 --> 05:27.641
We're three for three
and counting.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.651
Yep, somebody's trading
the old for the new.

05:37.651 --> 05:41.405
The soil on the toddler's feet
was laced with glyphosate.

05:41.614 --> 05:43.365
That's a heavy-duty grass killer.

05:43.365 --> 05:47.953
They may be resodding. So let's look for
a location where they're resodding, okay?

05:55.377 --> 05:56.128
Horatio.

05:56.879 --> 05:57.671
Go ahead.

05:57.671 --> 06:00.216
We've got four different bleeders,
and based on the alleles,

06:00.216 --> 06:01.550
they're all related to the girl.

06:02.885 --> 06:05.137
Horatio, we spotted the
house that's being resodded.

06:05.137 --> 06:08.265
It's coming up on your right.
I'll get fire and rescue.

06:17.817 --> 06:18.859
Easy.

06:26.575 --> 06:27.618
This is the place.

06:34.208 --> 06:34.917
Ready?

06:34.917 --> 06:35.918
Yeah.

06:38.003 --> 06:40.840
Detective Sevilla!
Miami-Dade Police!

06:49.849 --> 06:51.934
Miami-Dade
Police Department!

07:04.905 --> 07:06.157
Police department!

07:19.503 --> 07:21.922
Get me rescue in here!
I have a survivor!

07:21.922 --> 07:23.007
Roll fire/rescue!

07:23.007 --> 07:24.300
Who did this to you, sir?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.469
My son ... needs help ...

07:26.469 --> 07:31.015
Listen to me. Think.
Is there anybody else in the house? Sir?

07:31.015 --> 07:32.057
Okay.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.573
All clear.

07:54.830 --> 07:55.831
Horatio ...

07:56.332 --> 07:57.166
Yeah?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.168
We got another one.

07:59.168 --> 08:00.211
Okay.

08:16.477 --> 08:19.188
Have your guys hang out.
They're going to be here awhile.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.156
What's that?

08:32.284 --> 08:33.327
What?

09:13.659 --> 09:15.202
The final blood count is five.

09:15.828 --> 09:19.415
Four dead, three kids.
One adult survived.

09:19.707 --> 09:20.875
Any sign of an intruder?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.460
Not at first glance.

09:24.336 --> 09:27.339
Well, the last guy standing
is the one I want to talk to.

09:27.339 --> 09:31.343
Actually, he's not standing;
he's riding. That was him.

09:31.969 --> 09:33.137
Where's the little girl?

09:33.137 --> 09:36.599
She's with social services till
they place her with the family.

09:36.599 --> 09:38.684
If she has any left.

09:45.355 --> 09:46.940
Let's start in the back, Eric.

09:49.693 --> 09:52.153
Might take a minute to
acclimate yourself.

09:52.153 --> 09:54.239
There's a whole lot of red in there.
Okay?

10:11.256 --> 10:13.967
Occupants are Jason
and Stephanie Caplin.

10:13.967 --> 10:16.052
Dad's an optician at Stonybrook Mall.

10:16.845 --> 10:18.096
Mom's a stay-at-home.

10:21.808 --> 10:26.396
Four kids:
The oldest is Luke, he's 16;

10:26.396 --> 10:30.567
Timothy's 9 and the only other
victim found in a separate room.

10:33.778 --> 10:38.617
Our toddler, Erin, the only surviving
child, is seventeen months.

10:43.538 --> 10:46.416
And Max ...
six weeks.

10:48.001 --> 10:52.881
Not a very long time down with us,
Angel. And back up you go.

10:53.506 --> 10:57.260
Neighbors say nice family nice kids,
never any problems.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.888
Mom was tired because of new baby.

10:59.888 --> 11:02.933
Front and sliding glass
doors were both open.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.351
No signs of forced entry,
though.

11:04.351 --> 11:07.270
Nothing else suspicious on the outside
perimeter of the house, either.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.522
Okay, so everything
we need is right here...

11:09.522 --> 11:13.360
and we have a happy, all-american family
shotgunned to death in their home.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.321
Except the dad and the toddler.
Right, but the toddler belonged home.

11:16.321 --> 11:17.530
What was the dad doing here?

11:17.530 --> 11:19.908
Along with two kids who
should've been in school.

11:19.908 --> 11:21.701
Alexx, do we have a time of death?

11:21.701 --> 11:23.995
Between 11:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M.

11:23.995 --> 11:26.831
Was everyone home for lunch and
they got surprised by someone?

11:26.831 --> 11:27.707
Someone they knew.

11:27.707 --> 11:32.796
What we do know is that mom is the
only one not shot in the back, right?

11:32.796 --> 11:36.383
Mom's wound is consistent with
a self-inflicted gunshot.

11:36.383 --> 11:38.635
We have spatter on
that muzzle, Calleigh?

11:38.635 --> 11:39.719
Yeah.

11:42.722 --> 11:45.600
And a number four buck.
That's a hell of a recoil.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.937
So it could've bounced out of someone's
hand and made the three feet, right?

11:48.937 --> 11:52.148
Yeah, it could've come out of dad's
grip or come out of mom's.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.901
All right, let's GSR everybody
and start with mom.

11:54.901 --> 11:57.779
Well, if we're looking at murder-suicide,
she was the last to die.

11:57.779 --> 12:01.283
Right. So we need a timeline.
Who was shot when? Let's work on that.

12:01.283 --> 12:03.410
The blood will give us that,
but it's going to take a while.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.370
Take all the time you need.

12:05.370 --> 12:07.414
Let's alert the neighbors they're
going to have company for awhile.

12:07.414 --> 12:08.456
You bet.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.042
The wound area's wide.

12:11.876 --> 12:13.628
From a pellet pattern, right?

12:13.920 --> 12:18.091
Enough distance from the shooter
to the victim for the pellets to spread.

12:20.927 --> 12:22.262
No defensive posture.

12:22.262 --> 12:24.556
That's because he was
taken by surprise.

12:24.556 --> 12:25.974
Probably because of these.

12:27.851 --> 12:32.022
"Sometimes I think that
I am better off alone"

12:33.315 --> 12:34.983
Liver temp is 99.

12:34.983 --> 12:39.446
If he died four hours ago with his mother
and brothers, his fever was 103.

12:39.446 --> 12:41.489
So, he was home sick.

12:41.781 --> 12:45.952
When you're ready to snap, one more
tug on your sleeve is all it takes.

12:47.287 --> 12:48.330
Okay.

13:30.205 --> 13:31.957
This is the only unmade
bed in the house.

13:32.791 --> 13:35.835
Yeah, kids are cleaning their rooms.
Mom and dad lived like this.

13:36.878 --> 13:38.338
Mom was, anyway.

13:46.263 --> 13:50.016
Dad's getting his needs met somehow.
Everything in here is washed and pressed.

13:52.602 --> 13:53.645
There's a crib in the room.

13:55.021 --> 13:57.107
Yeah, nobody's
getting any sleep.

14:03.154 --> 14:04.197
It's no excuse.

14:10.829 --> 14:13.206
Baby's first jewelry
was an amulet?

14:13.206 --> 14:15.333
Oh, you can get them at
any corner botanica.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.338
Not exactly the place you'd
shop for a newborn.

14:20.338 --> 14:23.174
They're actually supposed
to ward off evil spirits.

14:28.471 --> 14:29.514
So is this.

14:35.186 --> 14:38.273
Paroxetine HCl.
It's an antidepressant.

14:38.273 --> 14:39.357
Bottle's full.

14:39.357 --> 14:41.401
It was filled
three weeks ago.

14:43.486 --> 14:44.529
Hey.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.031
There you go.

14:46.031 --> 14:47.073
Thanks.

14:48.783 --> 14:52.078
Tell Horatio I'll call as
soon as I get something.

14:52.078 --> 14:54.998
Okay.
I'm sure I'll be seeing you again.

15:15.727 --> 15:18.563
I don't see blood or any
sign of struggle in here.

15:18.563 --> 15:21.524
No, not physical anyway.

15:21.524 --> 15:23.902
This place isn't a mess.
It's downright filthy.

15:23.902 --> 15:27.030
Kids will pick up after themselves,
but they will not clean.

15:32.702 --> 15:35.372
Empty fridge ...

15:35.372 --> 15:39.209
overflowing garbage.
They obviously live on fast food.

15:45.423 --> 15:47.717
Looks like somebody didn't
eat their lunch today.

15:52.514 --> 15:53.765
Got a couple of burgers ...

15:58.228 --> 16:00.313
half-eaten fry.

16:00.564 --> 16:03.191
Wouldn't have lasted
ten minutes in my house.

16:05.694 --> 16:08.822
Well, mom did give up the fight.

16:11.241 --> 16:12.909
Who's been taking
care of the family?

16:15.078 --> 16:19.416
Sick kid, teenager's
out of school early...

16:19.416 --> 16:21.501
dad picks up lunch
for everyone?

16:22.127 --> 16:25.463
I got a point on the timeline,
or at least a place to start.

16:27.632 --> 16:31.219
We isolated specific
bleeders on parts of the sleeper,

16:31.219 --> 16:34.639
but on the feet, it was an extreme
amount of everyone's blood.

16:37.225 --> 16:40.896
Okay, so the toddler was here,
veered away from the mother,

16:40.896 --> 16:44.441
around the father, sharp right
to the brother and the infant.

16:45.609 --> 16:50.280
But here, the blood from the brother
pooled around the toddler's foot.

16:53.366 --> 16:56.536
So that means the toddler
was over Luke when he bled out.

16:57.037 --> 17:01.666
This victim, this room temperature probably
didn't take but a few minutes.

17:01.666 --> 17:04.336
Hmm, so she was inside within
minutes of the killing,

17:04.336 --> 17:08.506
but she's the only family member not shot.
Why? Why was she spared?

17:08.506 --> 17:09.799
She's the only girl.

17:09.799 --> 17:10.884
She was hiding.

17:11.593 --> 17:13.094
Maybe she was just lucky.

17:15.805 --> 17:19.184
Mom normally drives the wagon,
but it hasn't been used in a while.

17:20.518 --> 17:22.145
Was that door closed?

17:22.479 --> 17:24.356
Yeah, the garage door was down.

17:24.981 --> 17:27.817
So dad goes to work,
like normal.

17:27.817 --> 17:32.197
At 11:45, he gets a call from mom,
and then he leaves upset, right?

17:32.197 --> 17:33.490
So dad's out of surgery?

17:33.490 --> 17:36.576
Not yet. Sevilla spoke to his assistant.

17:36.576 --> 17:40.121
Dad leaves his keys in the ignition ...

17:40.121 --> 17:43.250
but remembers to close
the garage door.

17:45.919 --> 17:47.712
And here's the gun safe.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.721
What is it?

17:57.764 --> 17:58.807
It's ammonia.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.686
Take a look at the
position of her body.

18:03.728 --> 18:06.106
She's the only victim we found at rest.

18:07.148 --> 18:10.235
Females don't usually suicide
by shotgun-- too messy.

18:10.777 --> 18:12.904
Well, did you see the house?

18:12.904 --> 18:15.407
I think there was a bigger
concern than mess.

18:15.407 --> 18:17.909
Okay, Speed, how long do you
think you're going to be here?

18:17.909 --> 18:19.077
All night.
All night.

18:19.077 --> 18:21.162
Okay, keep me posted.

19:11.254 --> 19:12.255
Alexx?

19:15.091 --> 19:17.302
Luke, 16 years old.

19:17.302 --> 19:20.347
Shot twice: Once in the shoulder,
once at the base of the skull.

19:20.347 --> 19:23.224
Two wounds.
Maybe he was on the move.

19:23.224 --> 19:26.478
Running only gave the buckshot
pattern room to expand.

19:26.478 --> 19:27.938
Enough to hit the baby.

19:27.938 --> 19:30.899
Newborn --
a few pellets was all it took.

19:32.692 --> 19:37.364
People really don't chew,
especially hungry teens.

19:37.364 --> 19:40.242
And the infamous half-eaten
bag of french fries.

19:40.242 --> 19:45.455
So ... Luke brings home lunch but doesn't
get to eat because the killing has started.

19:45.747 --> 19:49.292
Something else.
He had an acute gastric ulcer.

19:52.754 --> 19:56.466
He bit his nails, and the
enamel on the dentition...

19:56.466 --> 19:58.343
was worn down to the
second layer.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.515
A 16-year-old stress case.

20:03.515 --> 20:06.643
16 going on 40.
What about the mother's reach?

20:14.609 --> 20:16.319
Twenty-seven inches.

20:16.319 --> 20:20.198
Shotgun muzzle is 24.5. She could
have absolutely reached that trigger.

20:20.198 --> 20:25.203
No gunshot residue on her hands.
Not unusual with a long barrel.

20:25.203 --> 20:26.371
Dad and Luke?

20:26.371 --> 20:28.540
There's too much blood
on both of them to tell.

20:28.540 --> 20:29.833
What about the mother's wound?

20:29.833 --> 20:33.378
One shot, close contact, pellets
were a compact mass...

20:35.505 --> 20:40.176
... pushed by a pressurized gas cloud
into the brain, turning the medulla to pulp.

20:40.176 --> 20:41.636
So she died instantly.

20:41.636 --> 20:44.723
And the nine-year-old's wound
was immediately fatal, as well.

20:45.056 --> 20:49.102
One shot, dead center,
severed his spinal cord.

20:49.102 --> 20:50.145
Horatio.

20:51.563 --> 20:52.606
Okay.

20:53.982 --> 20:56.610
Jason Caplin just got out of surgery.

21:09.539 --> 21:12.667
Buckshot penetrated his kidney.
We removed it.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.669
Packed and ligated the renal artery.

21:14.669 --> 21:19.883
Sutured his multiple splenic lacerations.
He's got some will to live.

21:19.883 --> 21:21.760
Did he say anything
about his family?

21:21.760 --> 21:24.179
Just that he thought he
heard the baby screaming.

21:25.764 --> 21:27.015
Okay if I talk to him?

21:27.015 --> 21:30.936
He's slightly altered because
of the inhaled anesthetic, but ...

21:30.936 --> 21:31.978
you can try.

21:40.904 --> 21:42.030
Mr. Caplin?

21:43.073 --> 21:47.160
I'm Detective Sevilla.
I was at your house yesterday.

21:47.702 --> 21:51.539
Do you have any idea
who did this to you?

21:52.958 --> 21:56.503
I don't know. I ...

21:56.503 --> 21:58.797
I saw my son.
He was ...

21:58.797 --> 21:59.965
he was hurt.

21:59.965 --> 22:03.134
Did you see anyone else?
An intruder, maybe?

22:03.134 --> 22:04.970
I felt this ...

22:04.970 --> 22:07.055
this heat on my back.

22:10.016 --> 22:12.102
I heard the baby cry ...

22:15.313 --> 22:16.064
I don't know.

22:16.064 --> 22:20.026
That's okay. Tell me, Mr. Caplin, what
were you doing home from work?

22:20.026 --> 22:24.948
My wife had called.
She was upset ...

22:24.948 --> 22:27.325
You're never here!
I can't do this alone!

22:27.325 --> 22:28.702
We're both tired.

22:28.702 --> 22:31.538
You don't know what tired is!

22:31.871 --> 22:34.499
Make him stop! You've got to do
something to make him stop, or I ...

22:34.499 --> 22:35.542
Or what?

22:37.127 --> 22:42.465
Mr. Caplin? Did your wife threaten
to hurt herself or the children?

22:44.134 --> 22:45.176
No.

22:47.762 --> 22:49.848
She ... she loved them.

22:53.393 --> 22:54.811
Hey.
Hey.

22:55.854 --> 22:56.855
Dad's clothes...

22:58.023 --> 22:58.940
blood's starting to smell.

22:58.940 --> 23:02.235
All right. Come on in here.
Is he talking?

23:02.235 --> 23:05.614
He's not winning any spelling bees,
but he was lucid.

23:06.114 --> 23:09.451
Okay, now, he claims his wife called
him at the office and he came home.

23:09.451 --> 23:10.327
Did he say why?

23:10.327 --> 23:13.121
She was upset,
baby wouldn't stop crying.

23:13.121 --> 23:17.167
Now, it sounded like U-turns from
office to home were not unusual.

23:17.167 --> 23:19.336
Okay, did he say he
saw who shot him?

23:19.336 --> 23:22.005
No. Now, he remembers coming in...

23:22.005 --> 23:25.133
seeing his son covered in blood,
and then the next thing you know,

23:25.133 --> 23:27.218
he felt a hot pain in his back.

23:27.218 --> 23:28.595
Okay, in all your years,

23:28.595 --> 23:31.056
did you ever hear of a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the back?

23:31.056 --> 23:33.141
Most people can't
pull off shots to the front...

23:33.141 --> 23:35.602
without a fifth of scotch
and a very nimble big toe.

23:35.602 --> 23:39.648
Okay, so hormonal depression and
long arms could get us there.

23:39.981 --> 23:41.024
Okay.

23:49.074 --> 23:50.116
What do you got?

23:50.742 --> 23:54.037
Some hairs from the master
bedroom. Long, dark.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.206
Mom's a blonde.

23:57.123 --> 24:01.294
Well, in, uh, in
your spare time, maybe.

25:33.011 --> 25:35.555
Now, how are the crime scene
sketches coming?

25:35.555 --> 25:37.641
Marking evidence as it rolls in.

25:43.104 --> 25:46.233
Megan ran the hairs
from the master bed.

25:49.027 --> 25:51.279
Not the mom,
but a female relative.

25:51.279 --> 25:52.989
The sister was so broken up.

25:54.032 --> 25:57.369
Or maybe mom had more than hormones
and kids to worry about, huh?

26:37.348 --> 26:40.101
Did you know your sister
was seeing a psychiatrist?

26:40.101 --> 26:43.313
Yeah. Yeah, she was
having a rough time.

26:43.313 --> 26:46.483
Not sleeping, and,

26:46.483 --> 26:49.986
th-the baby ...

26:49.986 --> 26:55.200
the ... the baby cried a lot;
colic. And she, uh ...

26:55.575 --> 26:56.534
Here you go.

26:56.534 --> 27:01.748
Thank you. She ... she was
having a hard time.

27:01.748 --> 27:03.416
Can you be more specific?

27:07.837 --> 27:10.089
Because, you know,
baby blues are one thing,

27:10.089 --> 27:13.051
but postpartum psychosis,
that's quite another.

27:13.051 --> 27:17.096
My sister was depressed.
She wasn't crazy.

27:17.096 --> 27:19.224
She had medication
that she wasn't taking.

27:19.224 --> 27:21.518
She was worried about what
it would do to the baby.

27:22.894 --> 27:24.145
She was nursing.

27:27.065 --> 27:29.150
Have you seen that before?

27:29.150 --> 27:33.279
Yeah.
I gave that to her.

27:33.279 --> 27:37.492
It's a charm to make her feel better.
How about your brother-in-law?

27:37.492 --> 27:39.619
Did you help him feel better?

27:41.162 --> 27:44.707
We have evidence that you
were in their bed recently.

27:46.543 --> 27:50.130
All I wanted was my
sister's happiness.

27:50.130 --> 27:53.758
Well, that goal can get you into trouble.
Where were you yesterday morning?

27:53.758 --> 27:56.636
In Buffalo, on business.

27:56.636 --> 27:58.596
If you don't believe me,
call the airline.

27:58.596 --> 28:01.975
Still doesn't explain your little
trick between the sheets.

28:01.975 --> 28:05.937
I held my sister when
she couldn't stop crying.

28:05.937 --> 28:08.690
When she couldn't get out of bed,
much less the house.

28:08.690 --> 28:11.276
And that's a hell of a lot
more than he did.

28:11.276 --> 28:13.862
And that's your brother-in-law
you're talking about?

28:14.154 --> 28:15.196
Yeah, Jason.

28:16.156 --> 28:20.785
He hid at work day and night,
leaving her alone with four kids.

28:20.785 --> 28:23.788
Well, sounds like it was
too much for her.

28:24.622 --> 28:26.040
It was too much
for anyone.

28:26.875 --> 28:30.420
My sister loved those kids.

28:31.463 --> 28:35.633
Yeah, they drove her nuts.
Okay, yeah, she was a wreck,

28:35.842 --> 28:40.221
but there is no way in hell
that she killed them.

28:46.436 --> 28:47.479
Excuse me.

28:53.485 --> 28:56.779
I fumed the shotgun,
but there were no usable prints on it.

28:57.197 --> 28:58.239
Okay.

28:59.365 --> 29:00.950
So who do we think
was feeding the infant?

29:01.150 --> 29:02.402
Timmy's prints were on the bottle.

29:02.402 --> 29:06.572
Right, so the nine-year-old is parenting
the baby while the mother is doing what?

29:08.366 --> 29:10.702
I don't know, maybe she
was opening the gun safe.

29:10.702 --> 29:12.245
Hers were the only prints on it.

29:12.245 --> 29:14.205
So then why didn't
she kill the toddler?

29:14.747 --> 29:15.790
Couldn't find her?

29:17.083 --> 29:19.127
I mean, she's a woman
who can't function.

29:19.127 --> 29:21.421
If you can't function, you can't
keep track of your children.

29:21.838 --> 29:22.964
That's true.

29:24.507 --> 29:27.051
You know, plenty of times my
parents wanted me gone,

29:27.051 --> 29:29.512
but at least they fell
short of taking me out.

29:29.512 --> 29:33.683
Yeah, how short?
Just short, or miles away?

29:34.934 --> 29:38.563
What does "Delko"
stand for, anyways?

29:38.563 --> 29:42.984
"Delektorsky." My dad's Russian,
my mom's Cuban.

29:43.484 --> 29:45.069
Yeah?
Yeah.

29:46.529 --> 29:48.364
You got any brothers or sisters?

29:48.364 --> 29:49.991
Three sisters. Why?

29:51.034 --> 29:54.120
They're all older, right?
I mean, you're the baby.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.204
Maybe.

29:58.041 --> 30:01.377
So you think the little girl was the
favorite, and that's why she made it?

30:01.377 --> 30:04.047
Who knows? That's what
we're here to find out.

30:04.047 --> 30:06.549
Yeah.
Let's find out.

30:51.344 --> 30:52.720
They don't have a dog.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.348
Well, if they did,
it didn't last.

30:58.059 --> 31:00.144
But I guess we know
how the toddler did.

31:16.953 --> 31:19.497
I removed the pellets
from the shotgun shells,

31:19.497 --> 31:21.582
but I left all the powder in,
so it should give us a good kick.

31:22.417 --> 31:23.543
Okay.

31:27.088 --> 31:29.173
And usually suicides ...

31:31.217 --> 31:34.012
lean forward to get a better shot.

31:34.012 --> 31:38.641
Right, which would create
spatter directly above, right?

31:38.641 --> 31:40.893
But in this case,
the blood is back here.

31:40.893 --> 31:43.396
So she needs to be back.
That's good.

31:47.817 --> 31:49.736
Be about here.

31:49.736 --> 31:51.195
Yeah.
Are you clear?

31:51.195 --> 31:52.447
All right, here we go.

31:58.161 --> 31:59.287
There you have it.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.167
You used boiled noodles, huh?

32:04.625 --> 32:07.712
For brain spatter it was
either that or oysters.

32:08.755 --> 32:11.841
So she's either the most
relaxed suicide on record ...

32:12.884 --> 32:14.344
Or she was taking a nap.

32:15.053 --> 32:17.513
The blood on the blanket from
the doghouse proves...

32:17.513 --> 32:19.682
that the toddler was there
after someone was injured.

32:23.519 --> 32:26.564
Right, but her feet were drenched with
the blood from all five victims, though.

32:26.564 --> 32:29.359
Not until after she was
hiding in the backyard.

32:29.359 --> 32:33.655
The transfer from the blanket
came from one bleeder: The mom.

32:33.655 --> 32:36.240
And there's no chance she
walked outside by herself?

32:36.240 --> 32:39.118
No. I scraped every
inch of that blanket.

32:39.118 --> 32:42.080
It was loaded with her
saliva and epithelials.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.625
But no trace chemicals or
soil from the backyard.

32:48.252 --> 32:52.423
Eleven feet, four inches from the
doghouse to the closest doorway.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.300
Someone had to have carried her.

32:57.637 --> 33:00.473
So who had glyphosate
and soil on their shoes?

33:00.473 --> 33:02.892
That's what we need to find out,
gentlemen. Let's do that.

33:30.670 --> 33:35.550
Okay, here we go. Luke has traces of
glyphosate and soil on his shoes.

33:35.550 --> 33:38.177
So does dad.
No one else.

33:40.138 --> 33:43.558
Either one of them could've been
out back doing yard work.

33:43.558 --> 33:46.019
Which means whoever
carried the toddler...

33:46.019 --> 33:49.147
into the yard did so
with mom's blood, right?

33:50.398 --> 33:53.901
Right. So, her wound was instantly fatal.

33:54.944 --> 33:57.238
Which means someone
was still standing ...

33:57.238 --> 33:58.656
... after she died.

34:00.116 --> 34:03.536
And that means that this
is not a murder-suicide.

34:03.536 --> 34:05.371
It's a murder, isn't it?

34:06.414 --> 34:10.501
Now, there are only two family
members left capable of doing this.

34:10.501 --> 34:11.878
And that's Luke and dad.

34:16.966 --> 34:18.384
You think the kid
could've done this?

34:18.384 --> 34:21.721
I don't know. He's a 16-year-old
kid with an ulcer.

34:21.721 --> 34:24.849
Maybe he got sick of taking care
of everyone. What do you think?

34:31.987 --> 34:34.447
Why are you looking at the
pants and not the shirts?

34:34.447 --> 34:39.661
Shirts are a mess. Any spatter from a vic's
going to be lost among the primary.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.831
But it's hard to get spatter with a shotgun
-- the barrel's too long.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.128
Unless we're not looking
for spatter.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.550
That's transfer.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.393
That's tread ...

35:04.395 --> 35:06.481
from the toddler's footies.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.816
The question is:
Whose blood is it?

35:09.734 --> 35:10.735
Speed.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.447
What have we got?

35:14.906 --> 35:19.076
Results from the transfer stain
on Luke's pants. Mom's blood.

35:20.787 --> 35:25.124
Instinctively, he picked up the toddler,
thinking the killer might still be in the house.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.003
And he did it after mom
was mortally wounded.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.719
Okay, so mom and dad
aren't doing their jobs.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.304
The oldest son
steps up to the plate.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.932
Luke tries to bring his
siblings lunch ...

35:42.475 --> 35:44.769
and walks into a massacre.

35:49.023 --> 35:51.984
Once Luke's in the living room,
why not save the infant?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.695
The swing and the bassinet
were in the room.

35:54.695 --> 35:58.282
I don't know. Judgment call. Who could
imagine shooting something so small?

36:10.670 --> 36:12.713
While Luke is busy
saving the toddler,

36:12.713 --> 36:15.842
the killer goes after his
next threat: Timmy.

36:15.842 --> 36:18.511
Nine-year-old boy;
some threat.

36:18.511 --> 36:22.056
Okay, so Luke comes back in,
tries to save the infant.

36:22.056 --> 36:24.851
But he dies trying to get the
infant out the front door.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.060
And why does that happen?

36:26.060 --> 36:28.104
Dad was blocking his path.

36:28.104 --> 36:32.358
But dad's been shot in the back,
and his wound is not self-inflicted.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.527
Maybe it was the
result of a struggle.

36:34.527 --> 36:37.488
But over the only other
family member, the infant.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.157
Wait a minute.

36:44.370 --> 36:48.499
Speed ... whose blood did we
find on the infant's clothes?

36:48.499 --> 36:49.542
Let's take a look at that.

36:53.421 --> 36:54.464
Show me.

36:55.173 --> 36:57.258
The infant's own ...
Of course ...

36:58.843 --> 37:02.597
Luke's ...
mom's spatter.

37:02.597 --> 37:03.639
Where's dad's blood?

37:09.020 --> 37:10.480
Those are gravitational droplets.

37:27.830 --> 37:28.623
Good morning.

37:28.623 --> 37:33.836
Oh, finally. You the insurance adjusters?
Oh, hold on. You're, uh ...

37:33.836 --> 37:39.133
I'm a criminalist. Mr. Caplin, I'm with
the MDPD. This is Detective Sevilla.

37:39.133 --> 37:42.553
Right, right.
From the hospital.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.347
You're feeling better.

37:44.347 --> 37:49.060
Well, I spent four days in
the hospital flat on my back.

37:49.060 --> 37:53.189
I have staples holding my chest together, and
they're pulling up the flooring in my house,

37:53.189 --> 37:55.399
because it's rotted with blood.

37:55.399 --> 37:58.444
Yes, blood.
Blood is why we came today.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.155
We want to talk to you about
your blood on your baby.

38:05.535 --> 38:06.786
I ... I bled on my baby?

38:08.621 --> 38:11.124
I got shot. I guess my blood
must have been everywhere.

38:11.124 --> 38:13.668
Spatter normally travels,
but in this case,

38:13.668 --> 38:17.713
we found gravitational droplets
of blood on your baby's clothes.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.757
And just to be clear,
that's a problem.

38:19.757 --> 38:23.094
Right. Because that proves that you wer
standing over him while you were bleeding.

38:23.094 --> 38:26.556
Luke's body was covering that baby.
He died protecting that child.

38:26.556 --> 38:30.518
And you had, shall we say,
other instincts.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.493
You thought he wouldn't risk the
shot if you had the infant in your arms.

38:56.461 --> 38:59.172
Reverse the situation,
and you didn't hesitate.

39:13.978 --> 39:15.021
I never slept.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.899
I-I couldn't think.

39:19.275 --> 39:23.404
I mean, even at work, I could hear
them screaming for more.

39:24.447 --> 39:27.158
One morning I woke up,
and I just knew ...

39:28.409 --> 39:30.495
I couldn't face them again.

39:32.205 --> 39:33.915
So you shot them in the back.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.669
I tried, I-I ...

39:38.669 --> 39:39.712
I-I just couldn't.

39:52.934 --> 39:54.435
Did he just confess?

39:54.435 --> 39:56.896
He's laying the groundwork
for his defense.

39:57.313 --> 39:58.481
Insanity?

39:59.023 --> 40:01.526
Two-pronged:
"I didn't know what I was doing,

40:01.526 --> 40:03.611
and I certainly didn't
know it was wrong."

40:04.862 --> 40:06.197
Just might work.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.525
What is it?

40:43.234 --> 40:44.277
It's ammonia.

40:51.784 --> 40:53.161
Nh-3.

40:53.161 --> 40:54.036
Ammonia.

40:55.079 --> 40:57.415
Which was on dad's shirt,

40:57.415 --> 41:01.544
which he used to keep his prints
off the gun safe, didn't he?

41:01.544 --> 41:04.005
And then he called his
wife from the car.

41:04.005 --> 41:06.591
Phone records confirm he
made a call from his cell.

41:07.216 --> 41:10.344
Honey, can you check the gun safe?
I think I might have left it open.

41:13.306 --> 41:15.641
Dad comes back home
at 11:45 a.m.

41:16.350 --> 41:19.353
Opens the gun safe
without leaving his prints,

41:19.353 --> 41:20.813
and takes out
the shotgun.

41:23.316 --> 41:26.110
We can't prove that he told
his wife to close the safe.

41:26.110 --> 41:28.529
Yes, but any plan proves
premeditation,

41:28.529 --> 41:30.781
and that means he knew
exactly what he was doing.

41:30.781 --> 41:31.824
That's what it means.

41:46.047 --> 41:47.173
What do you have?

41:50.843 --> 41:52.929
Guess what
Jason Caplin's claiming?

41:54.680 --> 41:58.518
Postpartum psychosis.
By proxy.

41:58.518 --> 42:03.231
First, he frames his wife for murder,
and then he co-opts her illness.

42:03.231 --> 42:05.483
What a stellar human being.

42:06.526 --> 42:10.571
Yeah, I guess we just have to hope
that the jury doesn't buy his story.

42:11.614 --> 42:15.785
Well, the important thing now ...

42:15.993 --> 42:19.122
is that she really knows
what happened.
