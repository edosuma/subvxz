WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.337
Good morning, marketeers.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.073
Now, I don't think I need
to tell everyone

00:05.139 --> 00:06.707
that today is not just
any Saturday.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.343
It is the Saturday--

00:09.410 --> 00:12.012
the Saturday
before the Thursday.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.782
Oh, uh, sorry, Betty.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.350
Um...

00:19.753 --> 00:20.921
(whooping)

00:20.988 --> 00:22.223
Thank you.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.992
Why is Betty always the only one
with store spirit?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.060
What's Thursday?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.661
Thanksgiving.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.398
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.799
How could you forget
Thanksgiving?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.534
Oh, we don't really think
of it as Thanksgiving.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.169
We think of it
as the only Thursday

00:35.236 --> 00:36.570
of the year
we don't have to work.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.740
Well, that and Senior Skip Day,
which my dad still celebrates.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.777
Now, we will start employing
subliminal directions.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.679
If somebody asks you
where the cereal is,

00:45.746 --> 00:48.015
you tell them,
"Go to the turkey, make a left,

00:48.082 --> 00:51.085
"and when you pass the yams
and the cranberry sauce,

00:51.152 --> 00:52.386
it'll be
on the right-hand side."

00:52.453 --> 00:54.522
Josh, where are the pickles?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.056
They're right behind you.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.959
(sighs) Okay.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.761
One more time.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.696
I can't believe you
don't do anything.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.232
I love Thanksgiving.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.634
Seeing all four of my
grandparents together

01:06.700 --> 01:09.470
just makes me feel really
connected to my family.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.472
I've never met
Hope's grandparents.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.873
Lucy never introduced you

01:12.940 --> 01:14.908
during your storybook
romantic courtship?

01:14.975 --> 01:16.177
Oh, right.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.411
You did it in the back
of your van,

01:17.478 --> 01:18.779
and then she was executed.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.914
You know, it cheapens it
when you say it like that.

01:20.981 --> 01:24.218
Mmm.
Maybe Hope should
meet her grandparents.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.986
All right, crew,
let's bring it in.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.921
Come on.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.723
BARNEY:
Store opens in 30 seconds.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.692
Chop-chop.
We only get one shot at this.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.826
Okay, team.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.862
"Gobble, gobble," on three.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.199
One, two, three.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.301
Gobble, gobble!

01:45.373 --> 01:47.841
This is why
our softball team sucks.

01:54.548 --> 01:59.520
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

01:59.587 --> 02:03.090
* Birth control, no, no, no *

02:03.157 --> 02:06.594
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh *

02:06.660 --> 02:09.029
* Oh *

02:09.096 --> 02:12.800
* Oh... *

02:12.866 --> 02:16.870
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:21.709 --> 02:23.744
Ah, what are you
guys doing here?
We wanted
to talk to you

02:23.811 --> 02:25.613
about what we're going
to blow up on Thursday.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.948
Yeah, we found a deer head
some hunter left in the woods.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.317
It would be spectacular.

02:29.383 --> 02:33.020
And I think it would be
disrespectful and macabre.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.355
Ever since you learned
that word,

02:34.422 --> 02:35.989
everything is macabre to you.
Listen, guys.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.859
I'm not sure I can blow
something up this year.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.661
Pretty sure I'm going
to do a family thing.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.797
But, for the record, I think
the deer head sounds awesome.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.601
So you're just blowing us off
for a family thing?

02:48.469 --> 02:50.170
Dude, that is macabre.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.344
I can't believe
you bought a turkey.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.046
For all the money you spent
on that thing,

02:59.112 --> 03:02.750
you have any idea how many
pizzas we could have bought?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.852
Two.
I'm not going
to deprive Hope

03:04.918 --> 03:06.887
of Thanksgiving
the way you deprived me.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.956
We're having turkey.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.325
And I'm thinking of inviting
Hope's other grandparents over.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.294
The murderer's parents?
That's crazy.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.662
We don't even
know those people.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.197
Creeps me out--
the thought of sharing our table

03:17.265 --> 03:18.832
with the parents
of a serial killer.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.201
Would you eat
with Mr. and Mrs. Dahmer?

03:21.269 --> 03:24.872
Or the parents of that chimp
that ate that lady's face?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.073
That's creepy, man.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.375
Creepy.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.743
Look, guys, I know
we may not be able

03:29.810 --> 03:31.545
to get Hope
the best things in life

03:31.612 --> 03:33.146
or even the second
best things.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.348
We may be able
to get her

03:34.415 --> 03:35.916
the third best things,
but even those

03:35.983 --> 03:36.917
will probably come secondhand.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.952
This is something
we can actually do.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.454
Now, as a parent...

03:40.521 --> 03:41.822
Fine, if it'll get you to end

03:41.889 --> 03:43.324
your big, stupid speech,
we'll do it.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.830
Great.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.965
That's two and a half hours
we'll never get back.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.233
(sighs)

03:54.802 --> 03:55.936
(doorbell rings)

03:57.204 --> 03:58.872
Uh, hey.

03:58.939 --> 03:59.973
I'm Jimmy.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.275
Uh, I tried calling,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.711
but I felt weird
saying this on a machine.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.580
Um, I'm the guy
who impregnated your daughter

04:06.647 --> 04:08.349
before she got electrocuted.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.720
Oh. Oh. Oh, my.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.054
Uh, well, uh...

04:14.121 --> 04:15.222
Well, hello.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.291
I, um, I'm Dale.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.826
You can call me "Dr. Dale."

04:18.892 --> 04:20.027
Because I'm a doctor.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.563
But just call her "Margine"
because she's not a doctor.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.431
So...

04:23.497 --> 04:25.466
I'm going to go to the kitchen

04:25.533 --> 04:28.001
and make some iced tea
for the person who is here.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.103
Yeah.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.372
Is she okay?

04:31.439 --> 04:32.873
Well, Margine
has not handled the fact

04:32.940 --> 04:34.808
that our daughter
became a serial killer

04:34.875 --> 04:36.109
very well.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.277
But we're getting there!

04:37.345 --> 04:39.780
(chuckles)
We're not getting there.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.482
Yeah, the psychiatric
community frowns

04:41.549 --> 04:43.417
on therapists
treating their spouses,

04:43.484 --> 04:46.420
but she was my patient
before we started dating, so...

04:46.487 --> 04:48.456
Here's your iced tea.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.391
(whispers):
It's empty.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.360
Just drink her iced tea.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.296
Mmm.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.533
Listen. I came over

04:59.600 --> 05:00.868
to invite you over
to our house for Thanksgiving.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.169
You could, uh,

05:02.235 --> 05:04.204
meet your granddaughter.
She's pretty cute.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.839
I got her
picture here.

05:05.906 --> 05:06.907
Keep it in my wallet

05:06.974 --> 05:09.009
next to the condom
I always carry with me now.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.243
(chuckles)
You know.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.580
Fool me once, right?

05:14.114 --> 05:15.015
No?

05:17.651 --> 05:18.686
Oh.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.521
All right.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.058
(wailing)

05:25.125 --> 05:26.527
Oh, she's funny.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.228
She has, like... like...

05:28.295 --> 05:29.663
Uh, you know,

05:29.730 --> 05:32.265
maybe it is time for Margine
to take the next step

05:32.332 --> 05:33.801
in her therapeutic process.

05:33.867 --> 05:34.902
We'll be there.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.004
No, we won't!

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
Don't listen to her.
She's crazy. Just...

05:41.909 --> 05:43.276
Guys?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.679
VIRGINIA: Shh!
(Maw Maw snoring)

05:46.814 --> 05:47.848
Good news.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
Lucy's parents are coming.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.618
(groans)

05:50.684 --> 05:51.985
What's their deal?
Are they weird?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.421
Weird? No.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.556
They're not weird.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.358
They're weird.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.528
I can't stand weird people.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.997
Stop doing that!

06:04.064 --> 06:05.399
(moans)

06:05.466 --> 06:07.535
(whispers):
Get down.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.720
Do we really have to use Maw
Maw's coffin as a dinner table?

06:26.787 --> 06:29.089
It's the only thing we
own that seats seven.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.824
Anyway, it's not necessarily
for Maw Maw.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.959
It's for whoever dies first.

06:32.025 --> 06:32.926
Can't be me.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.261
It's too short.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.529
Unless I die in a magic trick.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.664
Which is never
gonna happen

06:36.730 --> 06:38.566
because no matter how high
I raise my hand,

06:38.632 --> 06:39.833
they never pick me
as a volunteer.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.070
Somebody parked a clown car
in front of our house.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.872
That's one of those cars

06:44.938 --> 06:46.306
you told me I'd never
be able to lift up

06:46.373 --> 06:47.741
all by myself.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.109
I'm gonna go lift it.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.479
Dad, don't. I think
that's the Carlyles.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.451
Sorry we're early.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.019
But Margine can
only leave the house

06:59.086 --> 07:01.088
when all the numbers in the
digital clocks are the same,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.991
so we left at 11:11,
because if we left at 1:11,

07:04.057 --> 07:04.825
we'd be late.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.529
Okay. Well, um,
do you want to come in?

07:08.596 --> 07:10.698
Margine, do you
think you're ready

07:10.764 --> 07:12.933
to meet your
granddaughter? Hmm?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.902
(wailing)

07:22.275 --> 07:25.012
(wailing stops)

07:25.078 --> 07:27.047
I still think we
need a few minutes.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.319
(grunting)

07:32.385 --> 07:34.287
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

07:34.354 --> 07:35.523
Virginia!

07:35.589 --> 07:37.791
I'm lifting a car!

07:37.858 --> 07:38.959
(grunts)

07:39.026 --> 07:40.327
You think you can

07:40.393 --> 07:41.729
steal my table.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.797
Just because you
slept with the boss.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.533
(groans)
Maw Maw, no!

07:47.267 --> 07:48.936
(Virginia groans)
JIMMY: What the hell?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.038
She saw the food and now
she thinks she's still

07:51.104 --> 07:52.472
working the lunch
counter at Woolworth's

07:52.540 --> 07:53.941
in 1949.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.817
86! Turkey!

08:05.418 --> 08:06.687
Oh, I think it's okay.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.888
Five second rule, right?

08:07.955 --> 08:10.724
Well, you can forget
about Thanksgiving.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.026
It's too late to cook and
the stores are closed.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.829
I can fix this!

08:17.765 --> 08:22.002
(cell phone ringtone of
a turkey gobbling plays)

08:22.069 --> 08:24.838
Go for Barney.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.741
James, it's Thanksgiving day.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.677
I knew it was a long shot.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.713
Our dinner got ruined.
I figured I could maybe go down

08:32.780 --> 08:34.181
to the store
and pick up some things.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.382
Throw something together.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.685
Uh, well, this party I'm at

08:37.751 --> 08:39.587
is kind of dying down.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.822
Uh, Aunt Mildred, don't
hog all the giblets.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.692
Uh, text me your address
and any food allergies,

08:44.758 --> 08:45.959
and I'll come
whip up a meal.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.228
See, that's not really what I...

08:48.295 --> 08:49.296
(dial tone hums)
Hello?

08:51.231 --> 08:53.634
Deep breaths.

08:53.701 --> 08:57.270
Visualize yourself
in a beautiful place.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.246
Do any of these
burners work?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.715
Half of the right
front one.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.382
You have to put
the center of the pot

09:09.449 --> 09:11.619
in the middle of that half
and then balance it with a lid.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.754
(doorbell rings)

09:18.959 --> 09:19.760
Hi!

09:19.827 --> 09:20.928
Come in. Come in.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.863
I'm Virginia. This
is my husband Burt.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.265
Hello. I'm Dale.
This is my wife Margine.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.600
Nice to meet you, Margine.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.768
(whimpers)

09:28.769 --> 09:31.238
Yeah, it's probably best,

09:31.304 --> 09:32.505
no one touch
each other yet.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.641
Don't worry.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.808
She won't burn anything.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.376
She just needs
to feel some pain

09:36.443 --> 09:38.145
to calm herself down.
Oh.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.648
I can't wait to do
this every year.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.750
JIMMY:
I think I know what
will cheer her up.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.284
I'll go get Hope up
from her nap.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.686
No, no.
Too soon for that.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.454
I think Margine
is uncomfortable here

09:47.520 --> 09:50.523
because this is bringing up
some of her feelings about Lucy.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.792
You know, what might help

09:51.859 --> 09:53.260
is some role-playing.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.995
Uh, Virginia,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.563
will you pretend to be Lucy?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.032
I'd really rather not.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.134
This is important
to the therapy.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.072
Burt?
Will you pretend to be Lucy?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.674
Sounds great.
What do you want?

10:06.740 --> 10:07.675
Young Lucy?
Prison Lucy?

10:07.741 --> 10:08.776
Ghost Lucy?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.143
Whatever Lucy you want
will be fine.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.444
Can I do it
with a Spanish accent?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.613
Let's keep it simple.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.816
(Burt clears throat)

10:17.417 --> 10:19.152
I'm Lucy.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
I'm a pretty, pretty girl.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.024
I have medium-sized boobies.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.727
Okay, then.
You guys enjoy your little game.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.961
Call me when dinner's ready.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.164
Mom?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.666
BARNEY:
Ah! Help!

10:32.733 --> 10:35.002
What? What?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.069
Help me!

10:36.136 --> 10:36.870
What the hell's going on?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.305
This little pipsqueak cook

10:38.371 --> 10:39.773
sent me out there

10:39.840 --> 10:41.709
to serve runny eggs
to the mayor!

10:43.043 --> 10:45.212
Easy. Easy.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.514
I don't know
what she's talking about.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.383
But she keeps making me look
at a napkin full of her snot.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.488
Barbara, I need you to stay
in this storeroom

10:55.555 --> 10:56.924
and take-take inventory.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.761
Jimmy, we don't want to mess

11:00.828 --> 11:01.929
with your traditional
family thing,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.663
but we need something else
to blow up.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.966
Javier wussed out
on the deer head.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.001
I looked into his eyes,
and he touched my soul.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.803
You can blow up anything
you find in the yard.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.705
I just need you to
keep Maw Maw busy

11:11.772 --> 11:13.306
while I'm giving Hope her
traditional Thanksgiving.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.975
You boys cannot come
in this door.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.710
You have to sit out
in the colored section.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.511
Looks like she's still back
at Woolworth's again.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.512
Follow me.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.415
Don't you stare at my keister.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.118
No, stop punishing yourself.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.755
I am not gonna let you
take the blame

11:27.821 --> 11:30.257
for the awful things
that I did.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.193
MARGINE:
That means so much to me.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.127
Mama, it's okay.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.062
Shh.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.096
(hushed):
Jimmy, this is

11:36.163 --> 11:37.230
going fantastically well.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.432
I think Margine is ready
to meet the baby.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.036
Shh.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.306
I know I shouldn't have
avoided you,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.409
but I was scared that somehow
you'd be like Lucy.

11:49.476 --> 11:53.280
And that somehow that would
be my fault, too.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.415
But you're just an adorable
little treasure.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.386
There's not a bad bone
in your body. No!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.687
Pick her up, Margine.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.223
Give her time, Dad. Jeez!

12:05.458 --> 12:06.760
Hear that?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.829
(crowd cheering on TV)

12:11.331 --> 12:12.332
(knocks)

12:12.399 --> 12:15.102
Well, Mom, you'll be happy
to know that

12:15.168 --> 12:17.070
Margine has bonded with Hope,
Dad's having fun.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.940
If you come join us,
I think we can actually have

12:20.007 --> 12:21.241
a real Thanksgiving.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.442
What the hey?

12:22.509 --> 12:25.312
I'm drunk and my team is up
three kicking points.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.716
Let's go talk to Dr. Dumbass
and his nutball wife.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.819
That's the spirit.

12:31.885 --> 12:36.123
Okay, who's who?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.190
I'm Lucy.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.826
Everyone else is
pretty much themselves.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.693
Which means you can be Virginia.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.895
Or Burt.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.096
I'm gonna stick with me.

12:44.564 --> 12:48.701
Lucy, I am very sorry
I was not a better hostess

12:48.768 --> 12:49.736
when you visited.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.638
I am sure you did not expect me

12:51.704 --> 12:53.773
to hit you on the head
with the TV.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.742
When did you hit Lucy
with the TV?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.377
Right before
I called the police.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.847
And the TV has not worked
the same since, by the way.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.181
Not that you need

13:01.248 --> 13:03.083
to buy me a new one, but...
You're the ones

13:03.150 --> 13:04.351
that turned Lucy in?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.286
Yeah. It's sort of
a family policy

13:06.353 --> 13:09.056
to call for help when there's
a murderer in the house.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.691
But that was my daughter.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.826
Who was a murderer.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.027
JIMMY:
So, Margine,

13:14.094 --> 13:15.462
you play any instruments?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.297
You know, you keep
saying "murderer"

13:17.364 --> 13:20.367
like we're the only parents
who have a kid with issues.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.334
I mean, yours is

13:21.401 --> 13:23.770
a slacker who
still lives at home.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.105
BURT:
Hey, time out.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.308
I'm gonna have to step out
of Lucy here for a second.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.244
We really being judged
by the couple of parents
of serial killers?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, a serial killer
with a college degree.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.048
Who had her own apartment.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.684
Which was a lot nicer
than this dump!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.552
Oh!
Whoa!
Okay,

13:39.619 --> 13:40.553
Mom, Dad,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.155
bedroom.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.357
(door closes)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.459
Guys, relax.
So they called me a slacker.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.095
Slacker's not even
the worst thing

13:48.161 --> 13:49.863
I've been called today, by you.

13:49.930 --> 13:50.964
That's different.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.765
I'm allowed
to criticize you.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.002
Imade you.
You're my mistake.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.669
Look, I know that
this is a big pain,

13:56.736 --> 13:58.771
but it's worth it, 'cause
Hope's gonna get a tradition

13:58.838 --> 14:00.207
out of it-- we just
have to get through

14:00.273 --> 14:01.708
one meal a year
with these people, and then

14:01.774 --> 14:03.977
we can spend the rest
of the year making fun of them.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.179
Why would I want
to make fun of people?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.648
You always make me out
to be such a monster.

14:08.715 --> 14:13.653
You with your beady eyes
and your Ruth Buzzi haircut.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.922
(both chuckling)

14:14.988 --> 14:16.123
Tell me you didn't enjoy that.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.663
Where did the weirdoes go?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.398
Hey.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.900
Where's Hope?

14:26.967 --> 14:29.869
Did those sons of bitches
steal our baby?!

14:29.937 --> 14:31.671
FYI: I had to switch
allspice for the nutmeg,

14:31.738 --> 14:34.307
so we'll be missing
some of the low notes
on the sweet potatoes.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.948
I shouldn't have told them that.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.920
Let's just call the cops--
they'll lock up these fruitcakes

14:46.987 --> 14:48.388
and we can get our baby back.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.090
Hope's already
lost her mom to jail--

14:50.157 --> 14:51.959
I don't want her losing
her grandparents, too.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.293
I'm going around back

14:53.360 --> 14:55.395
to see if the windows
are locked.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.529
(knocking)

14:59.099 --> 15:01.734
Look, Dr. Dale,
I could've called the police,

15:01.801 --> 15:04.204
but I didn't.
If you give Hope
back now, we can all

15:04.271 --> 15:06.974
still have a nice
turkey dinner together,
and this will all just be

15:07.040 --> 15:08.675
a silly story we laugh
about years from now.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.543
I-It's too late-- Margine's
bonded with the baby now.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.012
And the truth is,

15:12.079 --> 15:14.814
we can raise Hope far
better than a man in
suspended adolescence,

15:14.881 --> 15:16.683
his bipolar, alcoholic mother

15:16.749 --> 15:17.750
and the...

15:17.817 --> 15:19.286
well, whatever this one is.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.520
Pool guy.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.324
Now, I admit we didn't do
a perfect job with Lucy,

15:24.391 --> 15:27.427
but mistakes are why
pencils have erasers,

15:27.494 --> 15:28.695
why they have that
little "delete" button,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.630
and why they invented Wite-Out.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.965
What?

15:32.032 --> 15:35.268
VIRGINIA:
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.871
(engine starts)

15:38.938 --> 15:40.473
BURT:
Yee-haw!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.544
(car doors open and close)

15:46.546 --> 15:48.448
Hey.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.250
What's Shelley
doing here?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.319
We couldn't handle
Maw Maw alone.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.187
She thought I was talking
about civil rights.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.156
Then she started spraying
me with the garden hose.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.027
* Your knowledge
of racial slurs *

16:00.093 --> 16:01.461
* Is quite extensive *

16:01.528 --> 16:04.164
* And saying certain words
can be offensive *

16:04.231 --> 16:05.498
* We weren't so equal
many years ago *

16:05.565 --> 16:07.200
* Back then prejudice
was status quo *

16:07.267 --> 16:09.236
* People's brains
were in their behinds *

16:09.302 --> 16:12.072
* And yours is stuck
in 1949, hey! *

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
(laughs)
Hey, hey.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.709
Oh, God, they're back.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.745
I'll hold 'em off--
you go get the TV.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.613
DALE:
No, no, wait, wait,
no, we didn't...

16:20.680 --> 16:22.682
we didn't come to fight,
we just came to apologize.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.017
MARGINE:
You had

16:24.084 --> 16:26.053
every right to hit
me with the TV.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.488
Just like you had
every right

16:28.555 --> 16:31.291
to hit our daughter
with a TV.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.793
We're not good parents--
we'd probably ruin Hope

16:33.860 --> 16:35.762
the same way
we ruined Lucy.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.330
MARGINE:
And I know she said

16:37.397 --> 16:39.166
her crimes were
not my fault,

16:39.232 --> 16:42.102
but... that was probably
your husband talking.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.836
So we just wanted

16:43.903 --> 16:45.738
to say we're sorry.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.377
Hang on, hang on.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.380
It took a lot for you

16:53.446 --> 16:55.382
to come here
and admit you were wrong.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.050
I know what
it's like

16:57.117 --> 16:58.751
to feel like a bad parent.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.122
Jimmy's always yapping in my ear
about what a crappy job we did

17:02.189 --> 17:03.756
raising him.

17:03.823 --> 17:04.891
What are you doing?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.193
They tried to steal the baby.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.262
Who among us has not
done something crazy?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.764
I got a tattoo
of a foot on my foot.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.300
Grown-ups are
talking now, hon.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.001
Look, we can't undo

17:15.068 --> 17:16.569
the mistakes we
made as parents.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.406
All we can do is try
to be good grandparents.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.573
And I think

17:20.640 --> 17:24.244
that means making a...
good tradition for Hope.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.481
Great! So everyone
forgives everyone?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.153
Let's go make a memory!

17:33.220 --> 17:35.422
Burt, would you, uh,
like to say grace?

17:36.623 --> 17:38.391
Rock on.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.029
What up, God?

17:43.096 --> 17:45.064
Thank you for my family,

17:45.132 --> 17:48.735
and even though this baby
is the last thing we wanted,

17:48.801 --> 17:51.438
she's turned out
to be pretty cool.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.274
As for this meal,
I don't really like turkey,

17:54.341 --> 17:57.544
but thank you for...

17:57.610 --> 18:02.315
my good hair, which
thou hath not takeneth away,

18:02.382 --> 18:05.084
my strong jaw, straight teeth,

18:05.152 --> 18:07.654
(car doors closing)
rock-hard abs and...

18:07.720 --> 18:09.021
(tires squealing)

18:09.088 --> 18:12.091
They took Hope. Again.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.460
Damn it!

18:13.526 --> 18:15.928
* *

18:15.995 --> 18:17.530
Hope you enjoy spending

18:17.597 --> 18:21.534
the next five to ten
Thanksgivings in jail, bitch!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.937
Boy, at my age, you think
you've seen it all,

18:25.004 --> 18:27.207
and boom, something
else happens.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.849
I slaved over a
hot oven all day,

18:36.916 --> 18:38.785
and then you guys just run off,
and my food gets

18:38.851 --> 18:39.852
cold and ruined.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.355
I hope getting your precious
baby back was worth it.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.856
You were right, Mom.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.493
I shouldn't have tried to start
some silly new tradition.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.195
Trying is
the first step to sucking.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.697
Lesson learned.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.299
(vehicle approaching)

18:55.968 --> 18:57.103
(sighs)

18:57.170 --> 18:59.472
Worst Thanksgiving ever.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.107
We had this cheese sauce,

19:01.174 --> 19:02.342
it irritated my dad's IBS.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.411
He spent the whole afternoon
in the bathroom

19:04.477 --> 19:07.414
but forced us to include him
via video chat.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.450
Yeah, well,
my baby was stolen. Twice.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.619
I can't beat that.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.622
Let's drink!

19:15.688 --> 19:18.458
(speaking quietly)

19:18.525 --> 19:21.027
JIMMY:
All my plans went to crap.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.563
We didn't start the perfect
Thanksgiving tradition

19:23.630 --> 19:26.399
with a big family
sitting around a turkey.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.770
But when you think about it,

19:30.837 --> 19:33.706
maybe we stumbled into
an even better tradition.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.879
You're not surrounded
by a lot of relatives...

19:39.946 --> 19:42.949
but you're surrounded
by people who helped you out

19:43.015 --> 19:46.853
and stuck around when things
started to really fall apart.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.688
Here we go,

19:48.755 --> 19:49.922
everyone.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.190
Happy
Thanksgiving.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.792
(indistinct chatter)

19:55.628 --> 19:57.664
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

19:57.730 --> 20:00.733
* *

20:02.669 --> 20:05.572
They're your real family.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.741
Not so much
the people who kidnap you.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.511
Twice.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.747
(ukulele strumming)

20:14.814 --> 20:17.884
* What are you
thankful for? *
* What are you thankful for? *

20:17.950 --> 20:19.752
* What are you thankful for?
* What are you thankful for? *

20:19.819 --> 20:23.690
* Señoritas are thankful
for señors *

20:23.756 --> 20:26.393
* Charlie Sheen
is thankful for his whores *

20:26.459 --> 20:29.596
* My underwear
is thankful for my *

20:29.662 --> 20:31.364
* Underwear drawer *

20:31.431 --> 20:32.599
* What are you *

20:32.665 --> 20:34.434
* A-thankful for? *

20:35.768 --> 20:37.003
My daughter.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.007
Uh, button-fly jeans!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.711
I'm thankful
Maw Maw's still alive.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.714
(relieved sigh)

20:49.048 --> 20:51.484
I'm thankful
for gastric bypass surgery.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.721
I used to be 400 pounds.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.892
We're thankful for gunpowder.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.761
* *

21:12.104 --> 21:14.807
(explosion)

21:14.874 --> 21:17.444
(laughter, whooping)

21:20.447 --> 21:21.648
(laughing)

21:29.088 --> 21:32.058
Man... that is macabre.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.763
KID:
Thanks for watching!
(laughs)
