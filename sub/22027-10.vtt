WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.236
- I just got a call from,
uh, Zach.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.307
We are going on a date
tomorrow night.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.142
- Hey, Tina.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.143
- Are you here for
Bria Jamison?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.513
- Her dad got himself
in a mess with painkillers.

00:12.546 --> 00:15.049
- He's in no shape
to take care of her.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.550
- Did you see a girl
who was just here?

00:16.584 --> 00:18.786
- You and Gabby were walking
around skid row last night

00:18.819 --> 00:23.357
looking for Bria?
- I thought she told you.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
- That was the morgue.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.628
A Jane Doe teenage girl
just rolled in.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.030
She had my card in her purse.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.668
Hello, anybody?
- Someone's coming.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.670
I can hear them.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.806
- Sorry about that, we had a--
- Gabriela Dawson.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.274
Uh, you called
about a Jane Doe?

00:40.308 --> 00:42.343
- Yes, thank you for coming in.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.413
I just need some
identification.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.681
And what is your relation
to the deceased?

00:47.715 --> 00:50.151
- Uh, I'm her friend.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.787
- Look, you called me.
Can I see the body or not?

00:53.821 --> 00:57.658
- Gabby,
he's just doing his job.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.165
*

01:04.198 --> 01:07.868
- She was found in an alley.
DOA.

01:07.901 --> 01:15.309
*

01:19.213 --> 01:20.881
That's not my friend.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.453
- I'm sure.
That is not Bria Jamison.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.121
*

01:27.155 --> 01:28.722
- Track marks.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.458
Was it a drug overdose?

01:30.491 --> 01:34.262
ME still needs to make his
official determination, but...

01:34.295 --> 01:36.297
*

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
- I never saw her before.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.337
- So why did she
have your card?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.906
I-I don't know.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.275
Can I see the card?

01:47.308 --> 01:53.914
*

01:53.947 --> 01:57.185
That's Bria's purse.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.786
- There were no
valuables inside.

01:58.819 --> 02:02.690
No money, no ID,
no credit cards.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.758
It's like it was cleaned out.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.629
- Yeah, it's the one she went
back to the clinic fire to get.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.763
I remember it.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.699
*

02:11.732 --> 02:15.669
How did this girl end up
with all of Bria's stuff?

02:15.703 --> 02:22.610
*

02:23.577 --> 02:27.381
*

02:27.415 --> 02:30.818
- H-E-C-H-T.
Got it.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.387
Appreciate this.
Thanks, Bobby.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.356
Okay, ran prints off
the Jane Doe.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.524
She was in the system.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.492
A couple of
shoplifting charges.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.894
Name's Carly Hecht.
19 years old.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.563
- What do we know
about her?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.598
- A couple patrol officers
visited her last known

02:44.632 --> 02:46.400
this morning.
It was her boyfriend's place.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.704
- Gabby,
what're you doing?

02:50.738 --> 02:54.242
- This girl had Bria's stuff.
I wanna know why.

02:55.976 --> 02:59.980
- Look, you know I can't share
information like that.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.515
But you're my sister, so,

03:01.549 --> 03:03.951
if I were to write down
an address,

03:03.984 --> 03:06.687
and then turn my back--

03:06.720 --> 03:07.955
I didn't see that.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.225
- And that's why
you're my favorite brother.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.993
Thanks.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.766
- She's good.
- Good.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.505
- Wow, Hazmat Zach
already called.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.506
That was fast.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.541
- Well, after the way
you strong-armed him,

03:27.575 --> 03:29.343
he was probably scared
to wait too long.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.911
I did not strong-arm him.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.681
All I said was that you were
single and he was all over it.

03:33.714 --> 03:38.419
- Well, he asked me for dinner
tomorrow night, to Sparrow.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.020
- Oh,
I've read about that place.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.722
Sounds very cool.
- Mm-hmm.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.459
Not usually my jam,
but I said I'd give it a try.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.428
- Admit it,
you're excited.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.797
- I've had a lot of bad dates
this last year, so--

03:49.830 --> 03:52.300
- Just say it.
"I'm excited."

03:52.333 --> 03:56.370
- I'm cautiously optimistic.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.340
- Oh, but he is
an attractive gentleman.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.774
- Since when do you go
for gentlemen?

04:00.808 --> 04:04.044
- Since I decided
to improve my standards.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.747
- That's a smart move.
- Don't I know it.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.482
- Come on,
let's get to the cinnamon rolls

04:08.516 --> 04:10.618
before Connie does.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.556
- Hey.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.725
You got that text
from Dawson, right?

04:17.758 --> 04:20.894
- Yeah, eventually.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.663
- It was a long night.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.598
- For me too.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.835
Dawson's not the only one
who got close to Bria.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.908
Hey, I'm just glad
it wasn't her in that morgue.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.511
- Yeah.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.383
*

04:42.416 --> 04:45.018
- Oh, hey, you know
how Connie feels

04:45.052 --> 04:46.587
about fire tools
inside the house.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.021
- It'll only take a minute.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.524
I wanna connect a sledgehammer
to a Halligan bar

04:50.558 --> 04:52.893
so one guy can set the Halligan
into a doorjamb,

04:52.926 --> 04:54.695
and bang it into place
all by himself.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.064
- Yeah, but those two things
together are like 22 pounds.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.632
- It's a tool for real men.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.502
- I gotta say, it doesn't seem
like it would work.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.803
- And if it did,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.405
wouldn't somebody have
invented it by now?

05:04.438 --> 05:06.340
- Hey, no one
invented the computer

05:06.374 --> 05:07.408
until Bill Gates
came along.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.677
- Bill Gates didn't...

05:09.710 --> 05:11.979
Anyway, that thing
is hardly a computer.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.783
- Nope, it isn't.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.451
It's a Slamigan.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.620
- Say that again.
What--

05:19.653 --> 05:21.889
What're you calling this thing?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.458
- The Slamigan.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.693
- We're gonna be rich.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.097
- Yeah, and when did "we"
decide this was a good idea?

05:30.130 --> 05:33.401
- When he named it
The Slamigan.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.070
- Okay.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.106
all: Oh.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.509
- Slamigan indeed.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.710
- It's all right.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.111
If at first you don't
succeed...

05:44.144 --> 05:45.112
- I know, I know.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.747
This is gonna work.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.616
You just need to add
a real hinge on

05:48.649 --> 05:50.418
and you know, a steel plate.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.719
- Yeah, I guess I could get
the torch out

05:51.752 --> 05:53.587
and just braze something
together real quick.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.756
- No, a brazed joint
won't be strong enough.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.426
You wanna MIG weld it.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.993
I grew up in a farm.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.028
When the cultivator
threw a shank,

06:01.061 --> 06:02.530
who do you think
fixed it?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.865
- Hey, Brett,
can we run a little errand?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.734
- Sure.

06:06.767 --> 06:10.037
*

06:10.070 --> 06:12.840
Are you sure the police
already notified the boyfriend?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.876
- Yeah, Antonio said they were
here this morning.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.180
- He's good.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.549
- Good.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.751
- Okay, here we are.
102.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.727
Aaron?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.064
We're very sorry for your loss.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.466
- Sh--

06:38.499 --> 06:42.770
Carly was, like,
trying to stop using.

06:42.803 --> 06:46.840
She was tough enough
to do it too.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.211
- On and off.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.082
- Aaron, do you know
a girl named Bria?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.518
- No.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.086
That's a--
that's a weird name.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.525
- Uh-uh.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.627
She's younger than Carly.
Long, dark hair.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.196
They may have met recently.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.865
- If it was from, like,
last week or whatever,

07:11.899 --> 07:16.069
I wouldn't know
anything about it.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.572
We had a big fight on Saturday,

07:18.606 --> 07:21.775
and then she just took off.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.077
And I...

07:24.111 --> 07:26.179
never saw her after that.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.549
*

07:28.582 --> 07:31.719
- Any idea where Carly
might've gone?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.453
- Mm-mm.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.559
Maybe--maybe Safe Harbor.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.962
- I-it's a shelter
on West Jackson.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.565
That's the only place that
Carly would've gone to.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.935
They just take teens.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.103
- That's really helpful.
Thank you.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.106
We'll check it out.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.678
*

07:57.711 --> 08:00.914
- I just watched her leave.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.952
I--and I didn't even
try to stop her.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.923
*

08:09.957 --> 08:11.959
- Aaron,

08:11.992 --> 08:15.128
try to reach out to
some friends or family, okay?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.530
You shouldn't be
alone right now.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.131
- Ambulance 61.

08:18.165 --> 08:22.202
Woman in distress,
203 East Chestnut.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.271
- Copy that, 61, we're out.

08:24.304 --> 08:28.141
- Take care of yourself.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.153
- Neighbors heard
Mrs. Capizzi cry out,

08:40.187 --> 08:41.789
but no one answered the door.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.692
Apartment 3205.
This way.

08:44.725 --> 08:49.029
*

08:49.062 --> 08:51.164
- Fire Department,
Mrs. Capizzi?

08:51.198 --> 08:55.068
- Get in here!

08:55.102 --> 08:57.037
*

08:57.070 --> 09:00.608
- Good luck with her.

09:00.641 --> 09:05.245
- Hurry, hurry up.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.347
The button is jammed.

09:14.588 --> 09:14.755
.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.255
- My hand, do something.

09:19.827 --> 09:24.698
- I'm gonna disconnect it.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.999
- No, I'm still stuck.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.838
Ow, ow, be careful.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.173
An oyster fork fell
and I thought I could grab it.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.708
- I think your ring
is trapped

09:34.742 --> 09:36.209
on the side
of the mechanism.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.311
- Oh, my God, please don't let
it be the Lorraine Schwartz.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.782
- Uh, just a little twist here.
- Ah.

09:41.815 --> 09:46.654
Ah.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.157
- Oh, it's just
a small laceration.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.126
- Look at this,
my engagement ring is damaged.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.395
When you twisted
my hand to pull it out--

09:55.428 --> 09:57.731
- Your ring is damaged
'cause you stuck your hand

09:57.765 --> 09:59.733
in a garbage disposal
before shutting it off.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.369
- Well, that disposal
is clearly defective.

10:02.402 --> 10:07.040
You have no concept
of the value of this ring.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.709
I shouldn't have been
at the sink at all,

10:08.742 --> 10:10.410
but my housekeeper
called in sick.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.180
Now my ring is scratched
and I have to get stitches.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.749
It's just all so unfair.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.920
Lady, less than half a mile
from here is a shelter for kids

10:19.953 --> 10:21.121
who got nowhere to go.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.355
Kids who could be on the street

10:22.389 --> 10:24.357
or in a morgue
or God knows where.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.126
Now that's unfair.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.396
*

10:29.429 --> 10:30.764
- You drive.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.033
I'll stay in the back
with Mrs. Capizzi.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.172
*

10:39.206 --> 10:40.440
- And from that day forward,

10:40.473 --> 10:43.310
he was always referred to
as Brenda.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.312
A lot of people don't know
that's how he got his nickname.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.880
They thought it was
some kind of sex thing.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.148
I'm just saying.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.984
I wasn't there.
Anyway, I gotta run.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.185
Uh, I expect to
see you all there.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.687
You got your invites.
- We do.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.922
See you Friday, Chief Grissom.
- Okay.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.223
Anyone know, is Kelly around?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.125
- He's, uh, right behind you.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.727
- Grizz.
- There he is.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.328
- Oh, dropping these off.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.430
Wanna make sure
your Chief gets 'em.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.799
- Right there.
- There he is.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.900
- Wallace.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.368
- Chief.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.037
- Casey.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.273
Or should I say Captain?
Wow.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.274
- Good to see you,
Chief Grissom.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.012
- Well, I think you've had
my protégé here long enough.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.449
I came to reclaim him.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.085
I'm putting together a benefit
dinner and silent auction

11:25.118 --> 11:27.821
for the 100 Club on Friday.
All of 51's invited.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.489
- We're always here
to support our fallen.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.991
I'll see to it that
51 represents.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.292
- Thanks, Chief.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.061
All right, I gotta
hit up some other houses.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.796
You walk with me?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.499
Seriously, when are you
coming back to 36?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.769
I sent you here
for Squad experience.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.303
Didn't expect you
to stay this long.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.773
- Well, you should've known
I'd click with Boden.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.040
And what do you care anyway?

11:47.074 --> 11:48.776
Aren't you hanging up
your axe in the fall?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.277
- Don't remind me.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.445
Hey, let's get a couple
of beers after shift, okay?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.182
Been way too long.
- Yeah, sure, sounds good.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.383
- All right.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.396
- Hi, um, I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.265
Bria Jamison.
I heard she might be here.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.935
- We don't give out information
about our residents.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.804
Oh, I get it, um--

12:16.837 --> 12:18.505
It's--it's just that
this is important.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.241
She's underage and it's
an issue of her safety.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.510
- If she's here,
she's safe.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.412
See the sign?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.817
- My friend's things
were probably stolen

12:29.850 --> 12:31.484
by a resident here,
who later turned up dead

12:31.518 --> 12:33.220
from a drug overdose
on the street,

12:33.253 --> 12:36.957
so "safe" is not the word
that comes to mind.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.060
- We do the best we can
under tough circumstances.

12:40.093 --> 12:44.231
Part of that is keeping our
residents' information private.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.470
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.873
I know you do your best,
and what you guys do here

12:52.906 --> 12:54.107
is very important.

12:54.141 --> 12:58.011
It's just--um--
I'm just worried.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.413
*

13:00.447 --> 13:03.817
If you do see her,
Bria Jamison,

13:03.851 --> 13:06.419
can you tell her that Gabby
needs to know if she's okay?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.391
Please.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.161
- Residents here come and go.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.164
I wouldn't hold your breath.

13:17.197 --> 13:24.404
*

13:30.177 --> 13:33.881
- Am I the only one having
a "Flashdance" flashback?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.448
- You're old.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
Here it is, you guys.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.162
- The Slamigan.
- Eh, patent pending.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.563
- Let it cool off
a little first.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.464
- No, it's good.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.034
That weld's a 70,000 psi
tensile strength.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.402
Cruz won't break it.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.006
- Damn, girl.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.911
- Ah!

14:03.944 --> 14:05.345
all: Ooh.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.148
- Yeah, I'm good, ah.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.184
- "A tool for real men."

14:11.218 --> 14:14.621
- There's a--mm.

14:14.654 --> 14:18.258
You got a little slop
in the hinge.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.129
That's a design flaw.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.430
I'm gonna have to work on that.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.098
- But don't make it
too tight either.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.533
We don't want it binding.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.937
- No, "we" sure don't.

14:32.973 --> 14:37.644
*

14:40.680 --> 14:42.950
*

14:42.983 --> 14:46.153
- Hey.

14:46.186 --> 14:50.924
- You can't tell anyone
you saw me.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.661
And you can't make me
turn myself in.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.664
They'll send me away.

14:57.697 --> 15:04.938
*

15:15.182 --> 15:15.348
.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.149
- I mean,
I'm an approved foster parent.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.420
So I figure if I could petition
DCFS to let me be

15:20.453 --> 15:22.990
Bria's temporary guardian until
her dad gets out of rehab,

15:23.023 --> 15:25.258
they--they gotta at
least consider it, right?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.995
- I would think so.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.132
I left Tina Cantrell a message,
but you know how that place is.

15:32.165 --> 15:36.536
It could be a day or two
before she calls me back.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.206
In the meantime,

15:39.239 --> 15:42.375
I want Bria staying
at our place tonight.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.311
I know it's not 100% legit,

15:44.344 --> 15:47.747
until DCFS has approved, but...

15:47.780 --> 15:50.183
She can't go back out
on the street.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.356
- Of course she can
stay with us.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.061
*

16:01.094 --> 16:03.696
- I can't believe you guys
went looking for me.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.532
I'm so embarrassed
about all this.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.067
- Don't be.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.470
Everybody needs help
once in a while.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.175
Of course.

16:15.208 --> 16:22.215
*

16:26.686 --> 16:29.756
When I was a kid,

16:29.789 --> 16:33.060
my dad put our family
through some rough times.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.229
I was lucky.
A friend reached out.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.465
I went to live with her
for a while.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.704
Uh,

16:44.737 --> 16:46.606
not much.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.509
But your father,
he's different.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.078
Trust me.

16:51.111 --> 16:56.183
More than anything,
he wants to do right by you.

16:56.216 --> 17:00.087
- Maybe that's
what your dad wants too.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.721
I think...

17:01.754 --> 17:04.391
some people
just can't change.

17:04.424 --> 17:08.795
*

17:08.828 --> 17:12.765
- You're a smart kid,
you know that?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.406
- Oh, hey, here we go.
Version 2.0.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.242
- Feels pretty solid.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.311
I drilled out a bigger hole
on the sledge handle.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.379
Then we added
a thicker bushing.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.816
- Uh, okay, Cruz, uh, give it a
shot so I can get out of here.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.128
Ugh!
- Oh, that's too bad.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.297
Slamigan would be
a really great name.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.301
Drilled out too much wood.
It weakened the handle.

17:48.335 --> 17:52.205
This is a dumb idea.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.140
- No, come on.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.774
You know how many
Apollo missions there were

17:54.807 --> 17:56.676
before Apollo 11
put a man on the moon?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.211
- Ten.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.148
- Point is, have a little faith
in yourself, Cruz.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.116
Look,
I don't have to be anywhere.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.551
Let's keep working on it.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.719
- Yeah.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.690
- Cool.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.393
*

18:15.328 --> 18:17.230
- Uh, yeah.

18:19.366 --> 18:23.370
- Chief, are you aware that
Joe Cruz has been disrupting

18:23.403 --> 18:26.406
the firehouse with some
personal project of his?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.808
- I'm aware that
he's up to something.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.310
- Would you like me
to put an end to it?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.845
- Why don't we just
give it some time?

18:32.879 --> 18:36.849
Maybe it'll run its course.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.487
Severide,
what is Joe Cruz up to?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.690
- Psh, I don't know.
I'm staying out of it.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.760
- I, uh--
I wrote a letter to DCFS

18:47.794 --> 18:49.462
in support of Dawson and Casey.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.464
- Good man, I was planning on
doing the same thing.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.833
Hey, must've been
a nice surprise

18:53.866 --> 18:55.235
seeing Chief Grissom, huh?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.870
- Yeah, yeah, it's, uh...

18:57.904 --> 18:59.472
It's been a while.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.341
- Well, I don't know
if I told you,

19:01.374 --> 19:03.443
but he called me a couple
of times a year to grill me.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.611
Make sure
I'm treating you well.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.812
- Yeah.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.347
- Sorry about that.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.716
- You know,
my dad saved his life once.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.284
He dove through
a collapsed roof

19:11.318 --> 19:12.652
and pulled him
out of a fire.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.387
So when I got out
of the Academy,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.723
Grizz made sure that
I was assigned to his house.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.891
- Well, I don't mind
him hounding me.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.227
Means they're
looking out for you.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.495
- Yeah, yeah, he always has.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.532
You know, he's the reason
I'm a firefighter.

19:25.565 --> 19:29.669
Benny, you know,
pushed me in the direction,

19:29.702 --> 19:31.471
but I stayed because of Grizz.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.406
Built me up
more than Benny ever did.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.911
Uh, I'm grabbing a beer
with him later tonight.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.548
- Yeah, have a good catch up.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.417
I'll see you next shift.
- Yeah, see you then.

19:44.451 --> 19:48.221
*

19:48.255 --> 19:50.957
- I made up your bed for you.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.527
And here's some extra blankets,
and...

19:54.561 --> 19:57.430
Got some towels.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.299
- This is super nice.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.804
I don't know about that,
but...

20:04.837 --> 20:06.839
It's yours for now.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.309
*

20:09.342 --> 20:11.678
- Do you really think the lady
at DCFS will let me stay here

20:11.711 --> 20:14.414
until my dad's out?

20:14.447 --> 20:16.649
- I do.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.519
- That would be awesome.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.421
Mostly 'cause
we never got to finish

20:21.454 --> 20:23.590
that Crazy Eights championship
at the hospital.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.758
Bring it on.

20:25.792 --> 20:30.297
*

20:30.330 --> 20:33.300
- How did you get
a table at this place?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.435
- A friend of mine
works in the kitchen.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.503
- Ah.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.805
- Don't be fooled by
the pretentious sounding food.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.274
It actually tastes good.

20:41.308 --> 20:44.311
- Okay, so,
here's the thing, Zach.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.312
- Uh-oh.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.713
- I just have to ask you

20:46.746 --> 20:49.316
a few questions
before we order

20:49.349 --> 20:51.984
and become
fully committed to this date.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.687
- So right now you're
just flirting with it.

20:54.721 --> 20:59.992
- Well, yeah, this could be
several hours of our time.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.895
- Why didn't you ask
when we talked on the phone?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.897
- 'Cause you
would've thought I was rude.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.999
Okay.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.469
All right, uh, ask away.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.803
- Okay.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.739
Are you married?

21:12.772 --> 21:16.676
- Wait, why would I invite you
on a date if I was--

21:16.709 --> 21:18.978
No.
No, I'm not married.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.547
- No.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.484
- Only when I get hungry.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.652
- Uh-huh.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.755
- Stella,
you brave fires for a living.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.423
Come on, man up,
commit to this date,

21:30.457 --> 21:32.959
so I can order
the Bone-In Ribeye.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.764
- Fine.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.501
I will also have one of those.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.736
- So Boden says,
instead of the medal,

21:43.770 --> 21:44.904
can I have
my firefighters back?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.340
The ones that Chief Anderson

21:47.374 --> 21:48.575
has scattered
all over the city?

21:48.608 --> 21:49.942
- He says this
to the mayor's guy?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.578
- Yeah, and it--and it worked.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.980
Anderson about blew a gasket.
It was a thing of beauty.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.051
Good to see you again, Kelly.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.421
- Been too long.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.958
- Here's the thing--
- Uh-oh.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.894
- As I hurdle
towards retirement,

22:07.927 --> 22:09.496
I'm, uh--

22:09.529 --> 22:11.764
I'm looking around
and I'm wondering,

22:11.798 --> 22:15.602
What have I done to leave the
CFD better than I found it?

22:15.635 --> 22:18.871
That's why I'm--I'm--I'm more
involved in charities.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.640
I'm also looking
at the firefighters

22:20.673 --> 22:24.911
that have come up under me.
How have they turned out?

22:24.944 --> 22:27.046
- You tell me, Grizz.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.118
- Sure.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.554
- I talk to your dad about you,
Kelly.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.755
- Ah.
And?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.524
- He said that you--

22:37.557 --> 22:40.092
You had some setbacks, what
with Riddle busting you down--

22:40.126 --> 22:41.794
- If you wanna know
how I'm doing, just ask me.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.162
- I am asking you.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.897
And you're telling me stories
about a house

22:44.931 --> 22:47.700
that is always under siege
from one quarter or another.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.402
You're telling me how
you're running around

22:49.436 --> 22:50.703
with your paramedic friend
helping some kid

22:50.737 --> 22:52.539
who's stealing drugs.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.675
While her husband buckles down
and keeps his eye on the prize.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.577
Captain Casey,
what do you know.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.579
- Casey's earned every good
thing that's ever come his way.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.782
- Eh, it's not him
I'm worried about.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.086
- Look, I just thought you'd be
further along now, Kelly.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.888
You just--
you had so much promise.

23:10.156 --> 23:13.926
- Look, all I meant
was that you--

23:13.960 --> 23:16.829
Hell,

23:16.863 --> 23:18.130
I didn't mean anything.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.535
*

23:22.569 --> 23:24.604
Damn, I gotta drop off
a deposit at the ballroom

23:24.637 --> 23:26.105
or we're gonna lose the place.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.740
- I'll get the tab.
- No, not on my watch.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.743
- Grizz, I got it.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.878
- Okay.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.681
*

23:34.714 --> 23:37.149
I'll see you at the thing.
I hope.

23:37.183 --> 23:44.156
*

23:44.190 --> 23:45.792
- Hey, Stella.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.927
Do you wanna go out
and grab a dr--

23:47.960 --> 23:50.797
- Hey, Kelly.
- Yo.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.599
- Well--you know Zach, uh,

23:52.632 --> 23:55.167
he brought his Hazmat equipment
to the firehouse on Friday.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.571
- Yeah, sure.
How's it going?

23:58.605 --> 23:59.806
- Great.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.211
- W-were you gonna
ask me something?

24:05.244 --> 24:08.214
- No, no, I was just, um...

24:11.183 --> 24:12.519
*

24:12.552 --> 24:14.787
Just stopped by
to pick these up.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.857
Gonna meet some of the guys,
grab a smoke.

24:17.890 --> 24:18.991
Later.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.159
- Good to see you.
- Okay.

24:20.192 --> 24:25.097
*

24:25.131 --> 24:27.166
Here you go.

24:34.941 --> 24:35.074
.

24:35.107 --> 24:35.875
- The rehab place
says he should be out

24:36.943 --> 24:38.778
as early as next week,
and since we're already on file

24:38.811 --> 24:40.112
with DCFS
as approved guardians--

24:40.146 --> 24:43.015
- I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.253
- You'll need to reapply
as temporary foster parents

24:47.286 --> 24:48.688
for this specific case.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.122
And that can take some time.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.858
- That's ridiculous.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.160
- I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but

24:54.193 --> 24:56.262
it's gonna be hard to try
to convince my boss

24:56.295 --> 24:59.766
to make special accommodations
for a kid who has

24:59.799 --> 25:02.635
caused the department
so much grief.

25:02.669 --> 25:08.708
They want her under supervision
in a state-run foster facility.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.877
- I mean, a--

25:10.910 --> 25:12.612
I said she could stay.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.582
- Um...

25:15.615 --> 25:17.717
I'm sorry,

25:17.750 --> 25:20.920
but ultimately,
DCFS is responsible

25:20.953 --> 25:22.955
for keeping her safe.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.928
- The only place

25:28.961 --> 25:31.197
Bria is guaranteed
to be safe is--

25:31.230 --> 25:33.132
is with us.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.068
Because that's
where she wants to be.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.741
After all we did for Louie--

25:41.774 --> 25:43.242
All that we went through, I--

25:43.275 --> 25:45.812
I'm sure you can find a way
to get your boss

25:45.845 --> 25:48.214
on board with this plan.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.822
*

25:55.855 --> 25:58.290
- I'll do what I can.

25:58.324 --> 26:05.732
*

26:13.840 --> 26:15.975
Any firefighter that comes
into Molly's

26:16.008 --> 26:18.945
gets a free shot glass
that says "Slamigan."

26:18.978 --> 26:20.246
Come on,
it's good.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.315
- Uh--
Is it done?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.351
- Give it a try.

26:33.259 --> 26:37.163
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Yeah, haha!

26:37.196 --> 26:38.665
- As advertised.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.999
- Okay, all right,
easy does it.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.768
It's one thing to breach
a make-believe door

26:41.801 --> 26:43.135
in a controlled environment.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.271
It is another thing
to execute a forced entry

26:45.304 --> 26:47.006
in a real-world emergency.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.141
Just let Cruz enjoy his moment.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.711
- Wow, okay,
no need to get snippy.

26:51.744 --> 26:56.148
- Slamigan!

26:56.182 --> 26:57.684
- Muah!

26:57.717 --> 26:59.952
*

26:59.986 --> 27:01.220
- Missed a lot of school.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.822
Is there anyone we can contact

27:02.855 --> 27:04.323
so you can catch up
on your homework?

27:04.356 --> 27:06.292
- I was kind of hoping
being a homeless runaway

27:06.325 --> 27:07.326
would get me out of homework.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.896
Nice try.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.798
- Phone was ringing.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.900
Tina Cantrell's name popped up.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.268
Went to voicemail
before I could grab it.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.341
- Listen.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.244
- Gabby, I wanted to let you
know that DCFS has approved

27:25.277 --> 27:26.713
you and Matt
as temporary guardians...

27:26.746 --> 27:30.049
- Oh, my God.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.051
- That's fantastic news.
- Pick up the paperwork...

27:32.084 --> 27:35.755
- Phew.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.291
DCFS is gonna
let Bria stay with us.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.861
- Hey, nice going.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.830
- It was Casey
who made it happen.

27:45.832 --> 27:49.802
- Squad 3, structure fire,
1250 South Western.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.471
- Hey, Kelly.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.773
- Thanks for everything.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.475
- Yeah, of course.

27:59.511 --> 28:06.452
*

28:12.792 --> 28:19.866
*

28:25.237 --> 28:27.506
- Better mask up.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.841
- Some kind of chemicals

28:28.875 --> 28:30.376
burning inside
the loading dock.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.945
Don't know what it is, but
I'm not taking my guys inside

28:32.979 --> 28:34.847
till Hazmat gets here.
- All right.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.415
Hey, mask up, guys.
- Copy that.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.951
- Doesn't look like it.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.853
The place is locked up tight.

28:40.887 --> 28:41.954
- All right.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.389
We got an unknown
chemical fire.

28:43.422 --> 28:44.957
Hazmat's en route.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.358
Let's get that door open
so they can get inside.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.461
- Copy that.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.400
- Yeah, these should be
support lock pins.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.835
We'll just sever 'em.

28:55.868 --> 28:59.005
[explosion booms,
fire roars]

28:59.038 --> 29:02.141
- Squad 3, stay clear
of the windows.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.411
- All right,
everybody push back.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.213
- Colannino,
establish a perimeter.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.881
There's no telling
what's inside there

29:08.915 --> 29:11.417
or how big it's gonna get.
- All right, copy that.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.385
- We heard the blast.
Everyone okay?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.021
- Yeah, but we need
to pull back.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.422
There's a fire
inside the loading dock,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.357
and whatever they have stored
in there is exploding.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.159
- 55-gallon drums
of industrial cleaner.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.227
Fire must be causing them
to BLEVE.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.263
- Yeah, I've done Hazmat
inspections on the site.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.098
If the fire gets beyond
the loading dock,

29:26.132 --> 29:27.433
it'll hit
the mother lode inside;

29:27.466 --> 29:29.535
50,000 gallons.

29:34.340 --> 29:34.841
.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.875
- Look, we gotta make a stand.
- Yeah, say no more.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.577
Hey, guys,
we gotta get that door open.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.346
We need to contain
the fire at the loading dock.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.414
- Got the saw, Lieutenant.
- Yeah, Capp, you stay with me.

29:42.448 --> 29:46.152
The rest of you guys,
stay back.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.424
Hey, give me as much room
as you can.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.327
- Copy.

30:03.870 --> 30:07.173
- Hey! Let's keep at it.

30:07.206 --> 30:10.442
*

30:10.476 --> 30:12.011
- If we don't contain this,

30:12.044 --> 30:16.248
we're gonna have to evacuate
a ten-block area.

30:16.282 --> 30:23.489
*

30:26.325 --> 30:30.362
- Okay, we're good.

30:30.396 --> 30:34.000
Capp, you see anything
start to flash, hit the ground.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.334
- Copy.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.337
*

30:38.370 --> 30:41.540
- Whole place is hot.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.476
Colannino, let's get
a line in here, quick.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.213
- Copy that, Squad 3.

30:47.246 --> 30:54.253
*

30:55.387 --> 30:59.091
- Clear for Hazmat.

30:59.125 --> 31:05.364
*

31:05.397 --> 31:08.067
- The fire's inside.
We have to get in there.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.502
- Yeah, just stay back,
we'll get it open.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.138
Hey, Cruz,
bring a sledge over here.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.639
We're gonna need
to pop this door.

31:13.672 --> 31:17.643
- Yeah, yeah, wait there
Lieutenant, I got this.

31:17.676 --> 31:24.650
*

31:28.687 --> 31:30.522
- He calls it
the Slam-it-again.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.493
- The Slamigan.

31:34.526 --> 31:40.532
*

31:43.635 --> 31:45.271
- Cool.

31:45.304 --> 31:48.107
Hey 37, let's get in here.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.676
Hey, Cruz, nice work, bud.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.416
- Yes, it is.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.418
*

32:02.454 --> 32:05.691
*

32:08.594 --> 32:10.329
- Danger's past.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.666
You and your guys are free
to get in there and mop it up.

32:18.070 --> 32:21.440
- ...Worried there's some types
of commercial, uh...

32:21.473 --> 32:22.474
- Whoa!

32:22.508 --> 32:23.509
- Ow.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.211
- Gentlemen.

32:25.244 --> 32:29.148
The Slamigan has been tested
in a real-world situation.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.483
A trial by fire,
you might say.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.119
- It works.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.554
- We did it!

32:35.587 --> 32:37.389
- You guys keep saying "we."

32:37.423 --> 32:39.758
- Because I am gonna represent
you on this, Cruz.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.760
I'm putting a call in
to Nick Porter right now.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.195
- Hey, hey, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.630
You don't gotta get in touch

32:44.663 --> 32:46.365
with any of those pinheads
from KW--

32:46.398 --> 32:48.734
Listen, we can market this
thing on our own, Cruz, okay?

32:48.767 --> 32:50.269
Don't give away any of this,
you know,

32:50.302 --> 32:52.071
action to this
Nick Porter guy.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.073
- Yeah, give it to
Christopher Herrmann instead.

32:54.106 --> 32:57.043
- Wait--hey!
This is none of your concern.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.744
I got your back on this.
Hmm?

32:58.777 --> 33:00.612
- Mm.
- Hey, Mouch.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.081
Hang up that phone.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.682
Nick Porter and those clowns

33:03.715 --> 33:05.484
are gonna have
nothing to do with this!

33:05.517 --> 33:08.187
Mouch!

33:08.220 --> 33:10.222
- How long have you been
hiding your little secret?

33:10.256 --> 33:13.192
I worked on it
right in front of your face.

33:15.794 --> 33:19.631
- She lives with us.
Works with us.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.400
You can't do this.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.539
- You cannot be
in love with Brett.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.244
Yeah, says the guy
with the great girlfriend.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.446
- Lily doesn't work here.
She's not our roommate.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.217
- I'm not going to do anything
about it, Otis, okay?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.253
I know she doesn't
feel the same way.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.488
- Hey, Cruz,
do you still wanna go

33:42.521 --> 33:44.256
to the fundraiser together?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.592
'Cause I'm gonna go to the gym,
but I can be ready by 6:00.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.595
- Yeah, it's great.
- Okay.

33:52.631 --> 33:53.665
*

33:53.699 --> 33:56.468
- It's a disaster.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.372
*

34:00.406 --> 34:01.673
- I don't think we can
make that dinner,

34:01.707 --> 34:03.242
but the 100 Club is the best.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.577
If I just send in my donation,

34:05.611 --> 34:06.612
is Chief Grissom
gonna feel slighted?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.247
- No, that's fine.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.183
And hey, great work getting
that DCFS situation sorted.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.253
Bria must be happy.
- Yeah, thanks.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.788
Next hurdle is getting her in
to see her dad.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.591
Rehab facility has a policy
about no visitors

34:19.625 --> 34:20.826
during the last week
of treatment.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.694
- We gotta make this happen.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.463
Cruz knows a nurse
at the facility.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.099
Grew up with her.
I'll put him on it.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.401
- You make that happen,
I'll buy you a box of Cubans.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.237
- Deal,
but we smoke 'em together.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.340
It's been too long.
- Amen.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.482
- Are you going
to the fundraiser?

34:43.515 --> 34:45.884
- Yeah.
- Huh.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.220
I just--I--I thought you
would've blown it off,

34:48.254 --> 34:49.788
the way Grizz got
under your skin.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.491
- No, I'm over it.
You going too?

34:52.524 --> 34:53.692
- No.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.328
I have a date.
With Zach.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.796
- Yeah.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.899
- Wow, date number two.
You must like the guy.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.536
- Tsk.
I do, actually.

35:07.373 --> 35:11.210
- This fundraiser,
it's for a good cause.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.780
If you care about firefighters,
you might consider coming.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.620
*

35:21.653 --> 35:24.723
- It is a good cause.

35:24.756 --> 35:28.527
And I do care about
firefighters.

35:28.560 --> 35:33.665
*

35:35.467 --> 35:38.770
The "bathing bouquet."
Mouch, really, hmm?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.507
- It's a charity auction.
I'm driving up the price.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.510
- You bid $50 more than
the next highest bidder.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.412
- You know,
if you really wanted the thing,

35:46.445 --> 35:47.813
just say you're buying it
for Trudy.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.882
- Well...

35:50.916 --> 35:53.652
Well, don't you two
make a pretty picture.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.255
Ooh, bath crystals.

35:56.288 --> 35:59.191
- Mm, keep your distance.

35:59.225 --> 36:01.927
- So are you gonna
get me a drink or what?

36:01.960 --> 36:04.530
- We just got here.
- Yeah, exactly.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.366
What is taking so long?

36:07.399 --> 36:09.401
- Kelly.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.770
Thought maybe you got lost
on your way here.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.773
- Hi.
- Oh, yeah, Stella.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.508
How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.278
- Um, I need to borrow Kelly
for just one moment.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.381
- Oh, yeah, he is all yours.
I'll get us those drinks.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.683
- Deal.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.855
- Nah, we just live together.

36:33.459 --> 36:37.729
- Listen, if I was riding you
the other night, it's just--

36:37.763 --> 36:39.531
Well...

36:39.565 --> 36:40.466
Look, the fact is, Kelly,

36:40.499 --> 36:43.469
I know that you are
the sharpest, toughest,

36:43.502 --> 36:46.338
gutsiest firefighter
this city's ever seen, ever.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.706
- That's nice to hear.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.442
- That's why I wanna introduce
you to some people.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.544
I got the deputy commissioner
over there.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.646
A whole swarm of high-flyers
from Rahm's office.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.883
Just come over there and
thrill 'em with a story or two

36:57.916 --> 36:59.451
about crawling some hallway--

36:59.485 --> 37:01.887
- No, if all the same,
I'd rather lay low.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.923
Grab a drink with my guys.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.392
- You're part of my legacy,
Kelly.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.260
You carry your father's name.

37:08.294 --> 37:10.396
You might be content
riding out your career

37:10.429 --> 37:13.799
at that Squad table,
but that's not good enough.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.834
And if I can make things
happen for you,

37:15.867 --> 37:18.270
you damn well
better believe I will.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.741
*

37:22.774 --> 37:24.743
Enjoy your drink.

37:24.776 --> 37:28.880
*

37:28.914 --> 37:32.551
- Tell Joe Cruz he owes me.
Big time.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.052
- Absolutely.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.355
Thanks again, Pilar.

37:36.388 --> 37:39.758
- Big time.
- Understood.

37:41.793 --> 37:45.364
- It's just been a little while
since you saw him, that's all.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.333
- All right, that's his room.

37:47.366 --> 37:51.703
You have about a half an hour
tops before shift change.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.906
- Thank you.

37:57.943 --> 38:04.716
*

38:09.955 --> 38:11.523
- Bria.

38:11.557 --> 38:15.093
*

38:15.126 --> 38:18.063
- You look so good.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.831
- My angel girl.

38:19.865 --> 38:27.072
*

38:37.015 --> 38:38.884
- The way you stepped up
with Tina

38:38.917 --> 38:42.721
even when you
didn't have to...

38:42.754 --> 38:44.923
- Hell yes, I had to.

38:44.956 --> 38:52.330
*

38:54.132 --> 38:56.067
- I'm sorry
if I got too consumed

38:56.101 --> 38:58.704
with all this at first.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.840
- I wasn't gonna let this
go wrong for you or for Bria.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.110
*

39:05.143 --> 39:08.714
I just needed you to know
that...

39:08.747 --> 39:12.951
*

39:15.821 --> 39:19.625
- Um, when that whole thing
with Louie went down,

39:19.658 --> 39:23.962
your first move was
to pull away from me.

39:23.995 --> 39:28.600
Decide to do it on your own.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.970
So when you started
getting in deep with Bria,

39:32.003 --> 39:35.707
I got this sinking feeling.

39:35.741 --> 39:39.411
Maybe we were going down
that same road.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.848
*

39:42.881 --> 39:45.083
- I'm sorry.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.185
- Don't be.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.156
*

39:51.189 --> 39:53.925
I just want you to know that

39:53.959 --> 39:57.128
wherever you're going,

39:57.162 --> 40:01.066
I'm right here with you.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.901
- I know.

40:22.153 --> 40:22.521
.

40:25.090 --> 40:32.464
*

40:37.002 --> 40:44.209
*
