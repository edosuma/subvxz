WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.904
You know what I love most
about being pregnant?

00:03.937 --> 00:05.506
Burgers for breakfast.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.974
Just today,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.676
because I woke up
craving red meat.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.978
Now, look away, baby.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.313
Mmm!

00:12.346 --> 00:13.514
Hi!
Hello!

00:13.547 --> 00:14.982
Oh, it's open.
Come in.
Oh.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.250
DAVID:
What is happening?

00:16.284 --> 00:17.985
Hello. Good morning.
Good morning.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.320
Hmm.
Goldie,

00:19.353 --> 00:20.754
what is in your mouth?

00:20.788 --> 00:21.922
Oh, my God, is that fast food?

00:21.955 --> 00:23.157
Oh, please tell me
you're bulimic

00:23.191 --> 00:24.825
so at least it'll come up
before it hits our baby.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.926
DAVID:
Or...

00:25.959 --> 00:27.995
you could eat this

00:28.028 --> 00:29.863
healthy, organic food

00:29.897 --> 00:32.100
we just got you
at the Farmers' Market.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.501
BRYAN:
I had never eaten broccoli

00:33.534 --> 00:35.703
before I met David.
Nutrition can be fun!

00:35.736 --> 00:37.371
Guys, pregnancy cravings
are totally normal,

00:37.405 --> 00:39.273
and it's just so delicious.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.442
Yeah, I know, but

00:41.475 --> 00:44.445
that delicious burger
could cause all kinds

00:44.478 --> 00:47.181
of developmental issues
for our baby.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.682
See, not a lot
of people know this,

00:48.716 --> 00:52.520
but charbroiled meat is a
carcinogen proven to effect DNA.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.356
Oh, well, I ate like this
when I was pregnant with Shania,

00:55.389 --> 00:56.790
and she turned
out just fine.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.859
Okay?

00:58.892 --> 00:59.860
BRYAN:
Um,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.195
also, uh,

01:01.229 --> 01:03.063
we brought your mail over
that was forwarded to our house.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.199
Oh.
Oh! What's this?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.201
It's your very important
absentee ballot

01:07.235 --> 01:09.036
from the crucial
battleground state of Ohio.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.705
Don't forget to mail that in.
It's a big election.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.873
I know. We're having

01:12.906 --> 01:14.708
a mock presidential election
at my school.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.310
BRYAN:
That's adorable.
I love mock things.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.411
DAVID:
No, you love

01:17.445 --> 01:18.579
to mock things.

01:18.612 --> 01:19.880
So, spill the
beans, kiddo.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.048
Who are you gonna vote for?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.251
Well, most of the kids
are just gonna vote

01:23.284 --> 01:24.918
for whoever
their parents do,

01:24.952 --> 01:26.420
but I'm thinking
about voting Obama.

01:26.454 --> 01:29.590
Well, if you do the math
on that,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.892
that means your
mom is voting

01:31.925 --> 01:33.561
for... O.M.G.O.P!

01:33.594 --> 01:35.496
Mitt Romney? You
can't be serious.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.565
Goldie, you are carrying
our Democratic baby.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.400
Our beautiful
little donkey fetus.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.001
Maybe you guys should just steal
my ballot and vote for me.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.736
That's what my nana did in 2008.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.905
That is outrageous.
She can't do that.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.407
Yeah, this is America, damn it.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.575
You're free to vote

01:47.608 --> 01:49.910
for the black incumbent
president of our choice.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.011
Hmm.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.308
What's Smelly eating?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.210
Vegetables.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.878
You stay out
of my granddaughter's head!

02:24.912 --> 02:27.281
I put years into shaping it,
and I will not have

02:27.315 --> 02:29.817
you left-wing Nancy boys
poisoning her

02:29.850 --> 02:31.885
with your hug-a-Muslim
bull crap!

02:31.919 --> 02:34.955
Mrs. Forrest,
what a disturbing surprise.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.791
I will have you know
that my family has voted

02:37.825 --> 02:39.159
Republican since
Abraham Lincoln,

02:39.193 --> 02:41.729
the freer of the slaves.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.664
I am proud of my party,
and I have been

02:43.697 --> 02:46.133
a supporter since 1972.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.068
ALL (chanting):
No more war!
(car horn honking)

02:48.101 --> 02:50.304
Dick Nixon knows how
to keep America strong!

02:50.338 --> 02:51.972
That's why
I like Dick.

02:52.005 --> 02:52.973
Who is with me?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.343
I like Dick!
I like Dick!

02:55.376 --> 02:59.413
Oh, so we have you to thank for
Watergate and Reagan and Bush

02:59.447 --> 03:00.581
and baby Bush.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.749
Oh, honey,

03:01.782 --> 03:03.651
even we don't like
the Bushes anymore.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.419
But you're voting
for Mitt Romney,

03:05.453 --> 03:07.255
which is the
equivalent of saying

03:07.288 --> 03:09.323
the poor aren't entitled
to health care,

03:09.357 --> 03:11.992
or the environment
doesn't need protecting.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.262
Mitt Romney is interested
in preserving

03:14.295 --> 03:15.663
every American's right

03:15.696 --> 03:19.667
to make his or her own choices.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.335
Unless you're gay.

03:21.369 --> 03:24.338
I thought
gay wasn't a choice.

03:24.372 --> 03:28.041
You've already polluted Goldie's
womb with your gay sperms.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.176
Leave her vote alone.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.611
You know what I
think this is about?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.680
Obama is black, and
you don't like anybody

03:32.713 --> 03:34.214
who's not like you.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.216
Oh, I would slap your face
right now

03:36.250 --> 03:39.186
if I didn't want to get
a handful of man makeup.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.288
It is tinted sunscreen!

03:40.321 --> 03:41.689
DAVID:
I'm just gonna say it.

03:41.722 --> 03:45.526
Mrs. Forrest, I believe
you are a racist.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.562
Why is that the place
that all you liberals go to?

03:48.596 --> 03:51.198
Just because
I don't like a man

03:51.231 --> 03:53.801
who wants to take
my hard-earned money

03:53.834 --> 03:57.638
and dump it into
a broken system, I'm a racist?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.707
Don't you think
it's a little more racist

03:59.740 --> 04:03.411
to vote for a black man
simply because he's black?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.647
And what about you two?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.717
I don't imagine you're lighting
candles on Kwanzaa.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.051
Couple of hypocrites.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.386
Like every other liberal,

04:12.420 --> 04:14.888
you walk the walk,
but you can't talk the talk.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.491
That is not true! We have black
friends. We have oodles of them!

04:17.525 --> 04:19.159
Right.
We do, and if you
don't believe me,

04:19.192 --> 04:20.728
you can come to our
party on Friday night,

04:20.761 --> 04:21.929
and you can meet
them for yourself.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.997
Mm.
Great. I'll see you

04:24.031 --> 04:27.234
and all your homies on Friday.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.070
Great!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.573
So, we're having a party?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.575
Yup.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.943
Know any black people?

04:35.976 --> 04:38.746
How is it that we don't have
any black friends?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.448
Oh, David, we
have black friends.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.015
Like who?
Amir.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.917
Amir is not black.
He's Indian.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.420
He's of a hue.
(laughs)

04:46.454 --> 04:47.588
Mrs. Forrest is right.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.989
We are phony,
liberal frauds.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.257
We are racists!

04:50.290 --> 04:51.825
We can't be.

04:51.859 --> 04:55.529
We are two educated,
successful, enlightened gay men.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.997
I guess we can't be held
entirely responsible.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.466
We do meet a lot
of black people.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.100
Right.
We see them at work.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.769
Uh-uh.
We run into them
at parties,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.270
except for our own.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.872
I mean, is it our fault
that none of them stick?

05:04.905 --> 05:08.376
Yeah, using the pejorative
"them" is not helping our case.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.944
We have to get some black
people to come to our party.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.446
I will not be
called a bigoted,

05:12.480 --> 05:13.781
armchair liberal by anyone.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.649
Maybe I could get the
cast of Treme to come.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.451
I sat next to them at the
Golden Globes last year,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.019
and since nobody watches
that show anyway,

05:19.052 --> 05:22.089
they could easily pass as your
run-of-the-mill, non-famouses.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.628
Rocky, there you are.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.330
Bryan's coming down to
approve Clea's wardrobe.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.732
He has nixed everything
I've shown him.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.134
I'm running out
of options. Help.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.538
Not bad. You know, he likes
preppy in an ironic way.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.673
If you lose the belt,
you should be fine.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.642
And if you let him think

05:41.675 --> 05:43.577
he came up with it,

05:43.611 --> 05:45.345
he'll love it.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.414
Untuck your shirt.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.148
No one can be skinnier
than he is.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.183
Five more pounds
is not gonna kill her.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.885
All right.
I pushed editing
to 4:30.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.320
I know how you feel
about sitting

05:53.353 --> 05:54.488
in Brad's office
after lunch.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.656
Oh, thank you.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.257
That fart candle
isn't fooling anyone.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.692
Show me, my sweet.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.965
Now, I love it. Approved.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.337
So, whatever your plans
are tomorrow night,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.773
cancel them and
come to my party.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.675
You're inviting me
to your house as a guest

06:14.708 --> 06:16.844
and not to kill a spider
or scare a coyote?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.345
Of course! I mean,
it's nothing huge.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.080
It's just, you know,
a fun little soirée

06:20.113 --> 06:21.348
with my closest friends.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.685
And you know what?
Bring your friends, too.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.054
Just as many of
them as you'd like.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.390
It's gonna be off
the chain, yo!

06:30.424 --> 06:32.560
Hook? Off the hook?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.695
BRYAN:
That's not a thing.
(laughter)

06:34.728 --> 06:36.564
Shut up.
(laughter)

06:37.665 --> 06:40.033
Okay, see you later, guys.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.870
There's not a single
person of color here.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.238
Amir is barely ethnic. He's not
even dark enough to count.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.240
I see. Would you like me to wrap
a tablecloth around his head?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.309
It's just that the blond
Imperial Wizard is coming,

06:49.342 --> 06:51.211
and everyone here is whiter
than any woman

06:51.244 --> 06:52.880
who's had Ambien sex
with Tiger Woods.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.216
Why are we letting this
small-minded woman get to us?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.918
Because we don't
want her to be right.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.219
We are not hypocrites.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.721
We are human, which means

07:00.754 --> 07:03.223
we do not always
live up to our ideals.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.258
But at least we have them.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.927
Rocky!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.562
DAVID:
Oh!

07:08.596 --> 07:09.663
Hi.
Thank God you're here.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.764
Hi.
How are you?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.933
Oh. Thank you for coming.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.001
Thank you for having me.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.469
How are you?
Well, of course.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.770
So?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.707
So?
Where are your friends?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.614
If those aren't black albinos,
we are screwed.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.088
Why the hell did you bring

07:35.122 --> 07:36.657
those lilywhite snow bunnies
to my party?

07:36.690 --> 07:38.859
Excuse me?!
David and I are
trying to convince Mrs. Forrest

07:38.892 --> 07:40.193
that we have black friends.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.362
Oh, so when you realized
you didn't, you invited me

07:42.395 --> 07:44.364
because you thought
I'd bring a bunch of sistas?

07:44.397 --> 07:47.267
Right. Only we were hoping for
more Pointer and less Bronte.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.870
Okay, so, you're assuming
I only have black friends?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.204
That's racist.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.341
I'm horrible. I...
(sighs) I apologize.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.110
Please help me.
Lucky for you,
I invited my brother.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.212
Don't know what time he's
gonna be here, though.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.782
You know how black
people are always late.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.884
So, that's really a thing?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.021
Did you ask Amir if
he could beat-box?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.723
Excuse me.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.859
(whispers loudly):
Bryan, no!

08:11.892 --> 08:14.962
You're a waiter, so I'm going
to go out on a limb here

08:14.995 --> 08:16.363
and assume, actor, as well?

08:16.396 --> 08:18.198
Yes! And let me say,
Mr. Collins,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.232
I'm a huge fan of your show.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.234
Oh, thank you. Bryan.
Bryan. Please.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.537
Hey, how would you like
to audition for me right now?

08:23.571 --> 08:24.905
Right now?
Are you serious?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.073
Yeah, it's very simple.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.075
You just have to play the role
of my friend.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.243
Okay, uh, your friend.
What's my back story?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.645
Am I the kid you took in

08:31.679 --> 08:33.380
off the street after I saved
you from gettin' jacked?

08:33.413 --> 08:34.815
You know, like...

08:34.848 --> 08:37.250
My boy here was gonna die if
I hadn't saved his white ass.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.986
Oh, yeah, yeah, I love that.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.088
It's very nineties-era
Law & Order, but no.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.390
No. You are just
the long-time contemporary

08:43.423 --> 08:44.758
of a very successful

08:44.792 --> 08:46.760
color-indifferent,
TV writer/producer.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.428
And you're playing
opposite the guest

08:48.461 --> 08:49.763
who just arrived.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.098
She's playing
a very racist woman

08:51.131 --> 08:52.766
who doesn't believe
that I have black friends.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.301
And action!

08:55.268 --> 08:57.771
Excuse me. Ah,
Mrs. Forrest.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.607
Welcome. So happy
you're here.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.109
Oh, can the coffee klatch,
Marge. Where are the blacks?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.944
The blacks? Well,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.378
if you listen carefully,

09:05.412 --> 09:07.615
you can hear them in the
fields singing spirituals.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.949
Ooh, look. There's one.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.751
But she's not really
a friend, is she,

09:10.784 --> 09:12.786
because she works
for the missus?
(laughs)

09:12.820 --> 09:14.187
Hi, Nana.
Ah.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.256
Oh, Goldie, you're 24 years old.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.592
Would it kill you
to put on a little lipstick?

09:18.626 --> 09:19.860
Where's the kid?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.963
Oh, she's upstairs writing
Charlie Rose fan fiction.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.098
I'm gonna grab a soda.
Or... (clears throat)

09:25.132 --> 09:26.466
Even healthier
than a soda.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.301
Have you tried
coconut water?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.203
Come on, I'll show you.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.605
Mrs. Forrest, mingle.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.774
It's what us humans do.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.942
Well, well, well,
Jane Forrest.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.244
I'd like you to meet a
dear, dear friend of mine

09:37.277 --> 09:39.212
from way, way back.

09:39.246 --> 09:43.316
Charles Worthington III,
but my friends call me Tripp.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.218
(knocking)

09:45.252 --> 09:48.321
Hey.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.323
Hi.
How late am I?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.159
Oh. Super late. Everyone's
already formed cliques

09:52.192 --> 09:53.460
and picked out their cubbies.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.162
Damn. I'm going
to end up sitting

09:55.195 --> 09:56.764
with the booger eaters. Again.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.831
(both laugh)

09:57.865 --> 09:59.667
I'm Clint, by the way.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.001
Oh. Uh, Goldie. Hi.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.237
Hey, baby brother.
Good to see you.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.675
Come on, let's walk the runway.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.546
You think she's buying it?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.651
I'm not sure Black Frasier
is convincing anyone.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.486
Bryan was such a cut-up
at Princeton.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.422
Always joshing around and doing
the most scathing impressions.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.157
(both laugh)

10:24.191 --> 10:27.527
I'm guessing you're not first in
line at the Tyler Perry movies.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.165
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

10:32.199 --> 10:33.867
I did not sign up for this.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.036
No, but you did promote
our only waiter to best friend.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.938
Ooh, that looks yummy.
What is it?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.273
Meat with things on it.
Bon appétit.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.508
So how do you
know those guys?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.343
David's my doctor.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.511
He's excellent, too.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.013
Really knows his way around
down there,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.881
which is what you want
from a lady doctor,

10:47.915 --> 10:51.018
not that you would know--
or, uh, maybe you do.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.687
I'm sure you've seen
plenty of them up close.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.022
I'm going
to stop talking.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.156
(laughs)

10:56.189 --> 10:57.624
Are you sure
you're single?

10:57.657 --> 11:01.729
Yeah, mm-hmm, I'm single,
all right, very, very single.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.796
(chuckling)

11:02.830 --> 11:05.899
Uh... potatoes?

11:05.933 --> 11:06.900
Yeah, let's do it.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.736
TRIPP:
Mostly I work with Father.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.571
He has a boutique
arbitrage firm downtown.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.807
Your brother
and my granddaughter

11:13.841 --> 11:15.876
really seem
to be hitting it off.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.211
If they start dating, I swear
to God, I'll throw myself

11:18.245 --> 11:19.512
under a bus.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.482
If they start dating, I swear
to God, there is no God.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.617
(both laugh)

11:26.619 --> 11:29.589
Bryan, could I get
a splash more coffee
when you get a chance?

11:29.622 --> 11:32.592
Coffee coming right up.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.827
Laugh it up, drunky.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.928
Relax, it's Skinny Girl.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.429
It's only 100
calories per glass.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.832
That doesn't mean you can drink
four times as much.

11:38.866 --> 11:39.767
Goldie.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.134
Oh, great, thank you.
Delicious.

11:41.969 --> 11:42.936
Fruit.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.104
Why are you
being punished?

11:44.137 --> 11:47.775
Oh, they just know
I'm allergic to crust.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.010
(laughs)
And deliciousness.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.444
(coughs)

11:51.478 --> 11:52.579
AMIR:
Honey, you okay?

11:52.612 --> 11:55.849
Fine, just, cake went
down the wrong way.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.786
Well, fortunately you have
two doctors at the table,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.754
so choke all you want.
We are on the job.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.455
Yeah, so long as you have
health insurance.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.124
(laughter)

12:04.157 --> 12:05.458
Well, unless Romney wins,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.360
and then we'll just have
to sit here and watch you die.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.695
JANE:
Oh, you liberals.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.764
You sure do love to twist
the truth, don't you?

12:10.798 --> 12:12.132
Oh, that's right, everybody,

12:12.165 --> 12:15.102
we have a real, live Republican
at the table here tonight.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.537
Quick, everyone show
proof of citizenship.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.705
(laughter)

12:18.738 --> 12:19.940
So, Jane,

12:19.973 --> 12:22.209
you don't think all
Americans are entitled

12:22.242 --> 12:23.811
to affordable health care?
If you can find

12:23.844 --> 12:25.979
affordable health care,
more power to you.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.281
I just don't want
the federal government

12:28.315 --> 12:29.983
making decisions
that are

12:30.017 --> 12:31.451
my choice to make.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.153
Unless it's a woman's
right to choose.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.388
Yeah, or the right to
marry whomever you love.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.556
You know, by
all means,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.658
vote for your pet projects

12:38.691 --> 12:39.893
over the good

12:39.927 --> 12:40.994
of the entire country.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.163
Uh, equality is not
a pet project.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.631
It's actually
a moral imperative.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.733
Look, Obama's plan
might not have been perfect,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.301
but at least he tried
coming up with a fix.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.336
Yeah.
JANE:
Yeah, by making me pay

12:49.369 --> 12:52.339
every time some illegal
sprains his ankle

12:52.372 --> 12:53.173
jumping the border.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.174
This chocolate pie

12:54.207 --> 12:55.675
is delicious, by the way.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.078
Thank you, I
made it myself.
(Bryan laughs)

12:58.111 --> 12:59.512
Your whole system
is broke,

12:59.546 --> 13:01.481
and your Obama just
wants to keep dumping

13:01.514 --> 13:03.016
more money into it.
It's like giving

13:03.050 --> 13:05.986
penicillin to a Kardashian--
too little, too late.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.487
That's good.
So it's just
about money to you?

13:07.520 --> 13:08.856
No, it isn't
just about money.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.191
It's about personal
responsibility,

13:11.224 --> 13:14.161
and personal responsibility
begins at home.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.763
I run my house the way
the government should be run.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.931
Goldie pays rent.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.199
There are no handouts,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.533
there's no
freeloading.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.203
And the way you talk about
a woman's right to choose--

13:23.236 --> 13:25.505
if I hadn't taken away
her mother's right,

13:25.538 --> 13:26.606
she wouldn't
be sitting

13:26.639 --> 13:28.108
with us while we sip Amaretto

13:28.141 --> 13:30.043
around this table

13:30.077 --> 13:31.111
at the penis palace.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.379
Oh, yeah,

13:32.412 --> 13:36.516
that's right, 25 years ago
my prize of a daughter,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.018
She-Who-Shall-
Not-Be-Named,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.387
was headed
for the abortion clinic

13:40.420 --> 13:42.222
and I took away

13:42.255 --> 13:44.124
her right to choose.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.458
I forced her to take
responsibility

13:45.492 --> 13:47.394
for her actions.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.462
We would not be having
this rousing political debate,

13:49.496 --> 13:52.565
trying to sway
Goldie's vote

13:52.599 --> 13:55.702
because Goldie wouldn't be here.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.237
How can you say that
right in front of her?

13:57.270 --> 13:58.405
Oh, no, it's okay.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.573
She tells me that story
every year on my birthday.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.574
So, who wants more wine?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.076
I'll get it.
Yes, me.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.746
(overlapping chatter)

14:06.779 --> 14:09.216
This is a disaster.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.051
I can't believe we're trying
to impress this woman.
Shh...

14:11.084 --> 14:13.320
What are you
shush-shush-shush?
Look,

14:13.353 --> 14:16.256
I-I think I may have offended
some of your friends

14:16.289 --> 14:19.759
back there inadvertently
with my passion.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.760
I'm sorry.

14:20.793 --> 14:24.197
Oh, well... thank you very much.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.498
It was a
little harsh.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.935
I think this might be a great
time to change the mood.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.369
I bet your friends
would be thrilled

14:29.402 --> 14:31.104
to hear some happy news,

14:31.138 --> 14:32.672
like you and Sissy
are going to be mommies.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.907
Hmm, I don't know.
Oh, no, David's,

14:33.941 --> 14:35.175
David's superstitious.
Yeah.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.110
He wants to wait to announce
till the 12th week.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.947
You've got all your friends
together in one place.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.348
You're at the ten-week mark,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.183
out of the woods.
I think it would make

14:43.216 --> 14:44.784
the party memorable.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.819
Think about it.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.690
CLINT:
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.092
Want to go
to a movie?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.928
Oh, um, yeah,
that sounds fun.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.129
(glass clinks)

14:56.163 --> 14:58.031
So, since you are

14:58.065 --> 14:59.532
all our closest
friends--

14:59.566 --> 15:01.334
except you...

15:01.901 --> 15:03.036
...and you and you,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.037
now seems

15:04.071 --> 15:07.207
like the perfect time
to tell you

15:07.240 --> 15:08.976
that Bryan and I

15:09.009 --> 15:10.377
are pregnant.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.780
(laughter)
Thank you,
thank you.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.449
We are ten weeks along
with our baby

15:16.483 --> 15:18.485
and we could
not be happier.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.587
And we could not
have done this

15:20.620 --> 15:22.389
without our
amazing surrogate

15:22.422 --> 15:24.457
Goldie, so,
Goldie...

15:24.491 --> 15:25.492
A toast to Goldie.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.160
DAVID:
Cheers.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.795
You're pregnant
with their baby?

15:28.828 --> 15:31.798
Oh, wait, Shania really
should be here for this.

15:31.831 --> 15:32.799
Shania is Goldie's daughter

15:32.832 --> 15:34.334
from her crumbling
marriage.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.870
Excuse me, please.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.310
What?

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
I have got to get out of here.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.986
I am so sick of you all
crapping your $400 jeans

15:53.020 --> 15:54.587
over this Obama.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.922
Don't lump me in with them.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.258
Oh, excuse me, $20 jeans.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.426
I'm voting for Romney.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.427
What?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.761
You done lost your damn mind.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.664
Wow, a black Republican.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.466
You know,
I've heard stories.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.967
I just never knew
they were real.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.303
How can you turn your back
on Barack right now?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.304
I don't vote race.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.639
I vote issues,

16:12.672 --> 16:14.474
and I think Romney's
experience as a businessman is

16:14.507 --> 16:16.676
the thing we need to get
this economy moving.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.844
Goldie isn't answering.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.146
I think I might call the cops.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.181
You are not sending
a policeman to chase down

16:21.214 --> 16:23.783
a hormonal girl's
temper tantrums.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.951
I'll track her
myself.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.153
Yeah, why don't you hop
on your broomstick

16:26.186 --> 16:29.522
and write "Surrender Goldie"
over the Hollywood skies?

16:29.556 --> 16:31.624
Was that an actual
Judy Garland reference?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.127
I'm surprised you're not
wearing ruby slippers.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.128
Keep joking, lady.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.296
It's your manipulations

16:36.329 --> 16:37.864
that made her run off
in the first place.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.167
My manipulations, mine?
Yeah.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.336
This party is a bigger farce
than Tom Cruise's marriage

16:43.370 --> 16:45.038
to that girl
with the dead eyes.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.306
Which one?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.308
Okay, uh, this is getting weird,

16:48.341 --> 16:49.342
and, uh,

16:49.376 --> 16:50.510
my catering shift ended
an hour ago,

16:50.543 --> 16:51.878
so...

16:51.911 --> 16:54.214
I think we can both agree
that I nailed it.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.848
Call my people.

16:55.882 --> 16:56.849
I knew it.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.685
He's an actor.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.719
He was a black actor.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
Farce.
A blactor.
Enough, hey!

17:01.354 --> 17:03.990
The important thing
is that we find Goldie.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.858
Now, where the hell
could she be?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.694
I think I might
know where she is.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.067
See, told you
she'd be here.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.538
Hey, hey, order me a double
cheeseburger and fries

17:18.571 --> 17:19.872
but say it's for you.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.208
I'll eat it cold, crouched
behind the potting bench

17:21.241 --> 17:22.742
in the garage after
David falls asleep.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.777
Your secret's
safe with me.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.551
Goldie, we are so sorry.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.353
We had no right to
announce the pregnancy

17:33.386 --> 17:35.255
before talking
to you first.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.589
And the food.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.226
David was so controlling
about the food.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.360
JANE:
Oh, come on,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.695
you know the real reason
you ran off is because

17:42.729 --> 17:44.464
Wayland and Madame here
were trying to sway your vote

17:44.497 --> 17:46.099
and keep that man
in the Brown House.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.235
(crying)

17:48.268 --> 17:50.203
No, no, no, no, you
can have the burger.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.071
Here, eat, finish the burger.
BRYAN:
Yeah, yeah, le-le-let's

17:52.105 --> 17:53.473
get you some chili,
too, I mean,

17:53.506 --> 17:55.542
I mean, if, if,
if you want chili.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.076
That's right.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.146
We still might
make suggestions,

17:59.179 --> 18:01.881
but if you want to eat
chili, you can eat chili.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.617
I'm sorry for being
so emotional, guys.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.652
It's just that I thought

18:05.685 --> 18:07.554
that moving out here,
changing everything,

18:07.587 --> 18:09.122
that my life
was finally going

18:09.156 --> 18:12.259
to be my own,
but it's not.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.093
Clay is suing me
for custody.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.295
This paper says

18:15.328 --> 18:17.797
I got to take Shania
back to Ohio.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.435
Hallelujah.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.970
That moron
finally did

18:24.003 --> 18:25.605
one smart thing.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.140
Okay, okay.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.313
(school bell rings)

18:38.485 --> 18:39.786
Hey.
Hey.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.788
So who'd you vote for?

18:41.821 --> 18:42.822
Well, I was
leaning

18:42.855 --> 18:44.624
Romney for a while
because he seems

18:44.657 --> 18:46.459
more committed to
Israel's security,

18:46.493 --> 18:47.694
but Obama believes
gay people

18:47.727 --> 18:49.329
should be treated
like human beings,

18:49.362 --> 18:50.663
and you guys are gay,

18:50.697 --> 18:53.633
so that made me
vote for him.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.101
Yes.
I feel like we're
watching her

18:55.134 --> 18:56.636
take her first steps.
Yeah.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.172
Hey, Shania, want to
help me pull my lever?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.440
Okay.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.309
Hey, let's save that for your
first term in Congress, kid.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.443
Off you go.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.278
So, Goldie,
how are you going to vote?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.347
Like daughter,
like mother?
Hmm?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.249
Meh.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.019
What, you haven't decided
who to vote for yet?

19:13.052 --> 19:14.321
A billion dollars in ads...

19:14.354 --> 19:15.955
I didn't say I don't know
who I'm voting for.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.123
I'm just not
telling you.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.958
Isn't that the whole point
of a true democracy?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.694
Well played.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.796
And we will
honor that.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.399
Blink once for Obama,
twice for the Mormon.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.434
(laughs)

19:34.541 --> 19:36.008
You know, it would be nice
to have more diversity

19:36.042 --> 19:38.711
in our lives--
if not for us, for the baby.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.512
It's true.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.847
Growing up with two white dads.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.049
I mean, how much travel
and culture and dance

19:43.082 --> 19:44.050
can one kid take?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.218
I'm serious.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.520
I know, I know, and I agree.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.189
I mean, we talk the talk, but
we don't always walk the walk.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.159
Not a word to
your grandmother.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.528
We will deny it,
I swear.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.896
You know, it's never too late.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.599
Come on.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.240
Um, hi, I'm Goldie,
Shania's mom.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.375
I'm Renee.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.377
This is my husband Joe
and our son Matthew.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.544
So, how far
along are you?

20:11.578 --> 20:12.712
Almost six months.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.113
GOLDIE:
Oh, congratulations.

20:14.146 --> 20:17.250
I'm not showing yet
but, um, I'm pregnant, too.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.551
Oh, congratulations to you.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.587
Oh, well, thank-- um, actually
it's, it's not my baby.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.455
It's theirs.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.524
I'm their surrogate.
(Joe chuckles)

20:24.557 --> 20:27.059
You know, we've
done this before.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.228
If you have questions about
being first-time parents,

20:29.262 --> 20:30.430
we should have
dinner sometime.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.564
Uh, we would love that.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.865
Yeah, that'd be great.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.066
Thanks.
GOLDIE:
Cool.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.402
Nice meeting you.
See you.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.536
This is perfect.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.905
You were just saying
we need some gay friends.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.808
(indistinct chatter)

20:41.841 --> 20:43.843
(all laughing)

20:48.915 --> 20:51.384
Okay, who would you vote for,
SpongeBob or Dora the Explorer?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.386
I think SpongeBob
would definitely push through

20:53.420 --> 20:55.888
gay marriage, and Dora is
better at foreign policy.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.057
Plus it'd be a landslide
with the Latino vote.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.427
I have one--
Easter Bunny or Santa Claus?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.896
Uh, Santa-- I think he uses
illegals to make those toys,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.998
but the Easter Bunny--
I mean, we never even see him.

21:06.032 --> 21:06.999
What's he hiding?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.301
Easter eggs?

21:08.335 --> 21:10.437
I still think he should release
his tax returns.
