00:05.920 --> 00:09.540
I can't believe I'm
about to deliver "Gabi's Box"
to my first paying customer.

00:09.540 --> 00:10.750
Sound like a hooker.

00:10.750 --> 00:12.620
What if not enough people
want a romantic dinner
in a box,

00:12.620 --> 00:14.250
and my new business
is a flop?

00:14.250 --> 00:16.040
Plenty of people
will want it.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.420
Look, people
are suckers for romance.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.580
But what if they're not?
I mean, what if more people
are like us,

00:19.580 --> 00:21.670
and they have sex-only
punch card relationships

00:21.670 --> 00:24.750
without the romance
or the emotions
or the feelings?

00:24.750 --> 00:27.290
Stop worrying.
People are not
as evolved as you and I.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.040
That's true.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.790
Oh, shoot, did I remember
the mini-champagne?

00:30.790 --> 00:32.290
-Yes.
-And the romantic playlist?

00:32.290 --> 00:35.080
Yes. You packed the bubbly
and the Buble. You are good
to go.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.540
Okay. All right.
I'm gonna knock,

00:37.540 --> 00:42.210
and when Marissa
answers, you snap a photo
of my first happy customer.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.580
It's gonna look so good
on my website,

00:43.580 --> 00:45.170
which you're making,
by the way, thank you.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.500
Hi, Marissa? I'm Gabi,
from Gabi's Box,

00:49.500 --> 00:53.120

Can you believe
Vinny did that to her?

01:32.080 --> 01:33.620
You understood that?

01:33.620 --> 01:35.580
Uh, they went out for two years,

01:35.580 --> 01:37.000
he ordered a romantic dinner
for her,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.080
and then he broke up with her

01:38.080 --> 01:39.460
outta nowhere right before
it got here.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.670
How did you not get that?

01:40.670 --> 01:42.540
I'm sorry, this is a bit
of an uncomfortable situation.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.920
Yeah, I know, uh,
will you stay with her?

01:44.920 --> 01:47.120
What? Me? No! Why?

01:47.120 --> 01:48.420
'Cause I have four more boxes
to deliver.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.290
So why don't you stay with her
and I'll deliver the boxes?

01:50.290 --> 01:51.830
Uh, excuse me, who is the face

01:51.830 --> 01:53.170
of Gabi's box? Gabi.

01:53.170 --> 01:56.250
People see Gabi's face,
and they want Gabi's Box.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.420
I gotta go, you gotta stay.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.710
I'm not staying with her.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.290
(crying loudly)

02:01.290 --> 02:02.830
Josh, look at her,
she's not stable.

02:02.830 --> 02:04.120
I mean, what if she
does something crazy?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.210
Like what?

02:05.210 --> 02:07.620
Like... give me
a bad Yelp review.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.920
Goodbye.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.380
Come on, Elliot.

02:17.380 --> 02:18.710
You need to lie down.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.920
Oh, Alan. You take
such good care of me.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.960
Oooh, have you been working out?

02:29.960 --> 02:30.960
The drugs they give you

02:30.960 --> 02:32.540
when they take out
your wisdom teeth

02:32.540 --> 02:34.040
must be good.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.750
You lie down on the couch.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.670
I'm gonna go get
my camera phone.

02:38.830 --> 02:41.830
(tapping sound)
What's that sound?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.040
Who's there?

02:53.290 --> 02:55.920
(tapping sound)

03:03.960 --> 03:05.170
Uh-oh.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.920
-Aaaaah!
-(chirping)

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
What's wrong?

03:11.920 --> 03:14.080
There's a squirrel
in the wall!

03:14.080 --> 03:17.580
We're in the penthouse
in a glass tower.
There's no squirrel.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.880
Yes, there is.
Look in the hole!

03:21.170 --> 03:23.250
Oh my-- Damn!

03:23.250 --> 03:25.580
Elliot, you can't go
makin' a hole in the wall

03:25.580 --> 03:28.210
every time you hallucinate
on hard drugs!

03:28.210 --> 03:30.750
If I did that, my apartment
would look like Swiss cheese.

03:36.710 --> 03:41.170
Oh my god... you know
how we look at really successful
people, and they're like smart,

03:41.170 --> 03:44.880
and rich, and happy,
and we hate them?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.330
Well, start hatin' me.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.500
My life sucks.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.040
You know, my first delivery
was a little rough,

03:52.040 --> 03:53.920
because my first customer
burst into tears,

03:53.920 --> 03:57.250
but I made Josh stay with her,
and the rest of the deliveries
went great,

03:57.250 --> 04:00.250
so let's
just say,everything's
comin' up Gabi.

04:02.790 --> 04:04.960
I've never been
this miserable.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.790
I'm making money,
I have a successful business--

04:07.790 --> 04:13.460
(phone dings)
Oh... Josh is comin' over.
And we all know why. Sex.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.210
How happy... are you...
for me?

04:18.210 --> 04:20.580
I hate everything.

04:20.580 --> 04:23.880
Wh-- What-- What is this?
What's going on?
You seem... down.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.460
Well... Logan asked me
to write my very first article
for Click'd

04:29.460 --> 04:30.830
and I have nothing
to write about.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.500
-Oh, come on, there's
gotta be somethin'.
-No. There isn't, Gabi.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.080
Okay, because she wants it
to be about something dramatic
and exciting,

04:36.080 --> 04:37.330
and I go to work,
I come home,

04:37.330 --> 04:39.670
I play online Yahtzee,
and I go to bed.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.670
Where is the drama
and excitement in that?

04:41.670 --> 04:43.460
(knocking on door)

04:43.460 --> 04:45.210
I'm really sorry,
but can we talk
about this later,

04:45.210 --> 04:47.420
because Josh is here,
and we're gonna have
like a bunch of s--

04:47.420 --> 04:49.500
Yeah, sex, I know, I get it,
you're having sex.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.380
-Hey.
-Hey!

04:59.380 --> 05:01.500
Sorry it took me so long,
I was a Marissa's for hours.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.880
Oh... yeah,
sorry I stuck you with her.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.120
That's okay.
First 20 minutes all I did
was hand her tissue

05:06.120 --> 05:09.210
after tissue.
You know, what you did
for me when... Han Solo died.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.790
But then she wanted
to enjoy your dinner,
which was delicious,

05:14.790 --> 05:17.710
by the way.
And we started talking
about relationships

05:17.710 --> 05:20.250
and feelings,
and we kinda hit it off.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.830
What?

05:26.830 --> 05:28.460
Remember how we said
if we met somebody,

05:28.460 --> 05:31.420
we would each tell each other...
and we'd put the punch card
on hold?

05:32.830 --> 05:34.500
Yes, the "Tell and Hold."

05:35.620 --> 05:37.290
The "Tell... and Hold."

05:37.290 --> 05:42.580
Okay. So...
I think this might
be the "tell" part.

05:42.580 --> 05:45.210
Because she asked me out
for tomorrow night,
and I...

05:45.210 --> 05:47.790
think I kinda
might've said yes.

05:47.790 --> 05:48.830
Oh?

05:50.790 --> 05:52.580
And I-- I wasn't even sure
I was really gonna tell you.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.120
Well... why-- why wouldn't you
tell me?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.830
I mean... what do you think
"tell" means in "Tell and Hold"?

05:56.830 --> 05:59.540
You can't have a "Tell and Hold"
without the "tell" part--
would you like some wine?

05:59.540 --> 06:01.830
Thank you, I'd love some.

06:01.830 --> 06:04.670
Well, I just figured...
what if the date
doesn't go well?

06:04.670 --> 06:06.460
I wouldn't have to tell you
because there'd be no hold.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.920
But then I thought,
what if it did go well?

06:08.920 --> 06:10.750
The right thing for me to do
would be to tell you,

06:10.750 --> 06:13.670
so this is me
telling you.

06:13.670 --> 06:15.460
Gabi, we might
be on a hold.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.920
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

06:18.920 --> 06:24.040
Yeah, this is great.
I mean, this is why
the "Tell and Hold" exists.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.120
So you're okay with this?
I'm not even sure I was.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.830
Wha--? Please,
why wouldn't I be okay
with a "Tell and Hold"?

06:28.830 --> 06:30.290
I mean, it's called
the "Tell and Hold,"

06:30.290 --> 06:32.750
I invented
the "Tell and Hold"!

06:36.000 --> 06:37.420
I toast you.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.580
Okay. Uh...

06:41.580 --> 06:42.670
Maybe I should go?

06:42.670 --> 06:46.830
What if I... tell you to leave,
while I hold open the door?

06:46.830 --> 06:50.710
That's a little...
that's a little
"Tell and Hold" humor.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.170
(both laugh)

06:52.170 --> 06:55.380
Wow. Uh...
you're amazing.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.500
Thank you for understanding.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.750
Mm-hm.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.710
Good night.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.750
Mm-hm.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.170
Gabi... I'm so sorry
to make this about myself,

07:05.170 --> 07:08.620
but I finally found an article
that is dramatic and exciting.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.710
A modern day romance gone awry.

07:10.710 --> 07:11.920
Awry?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.750
What's-- what's awry?
Nothing's awry.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.420
Oh my god, Gabi,
this is killing you.

07:17.420 --> 07:20.210
Okay, the ironic thing
is, if you hadn't told him
to stay with that girl,

07:20.210 --> 07:21.460
none of this
would've happened.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.670
(laughs)

07:22.670 --> 07:24.040
Is "devastated"
spelled with an "E"
or an "A"?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.580
Devastated? Oh my god.
Are you so desperate

07:26.580 --> 07:27.960
for a story
that you're just gonna...

07:27.960 --> 07:29.670
pretend that I'm upset?

07:29.670 --> 07:33.620
No, I mean, I-- I...
love that Josh is going out
with another girl.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.960
You know? I'm...
I am fine with it.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.580
Hi. Are you
Marissa's boyfriend?

07:39.580 --> 07:40.540
I... was.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.500
You need
to get back together
with her.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.670
Thank you so much
for asking us in, Vinny.

07:47.670 --> 07:48.750
I didn't.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.420
Who are you again?

07:51.420 --> 07:53.790
Oh, uh, I'm--
I'm Gabi from Gabi's Box.

07:53.790 --> 07:55.960
Thanks for your...
order, by the way,
make sure you like us

07:55.960 --> 07:58.290
on Facebook, so why the hell
did you break up with Marissa?

07:58.290 --> 08:02.080
I mean, she loves you
so much, and she thought
that you loved her.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.210
Hey, I do love her.

08:03.210 --> 08:05.500
I love her more
than any woman
I've ever known.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.540
It's just...
I have to marry
somebody else.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.290
Oh my god,
did you get
somebody else pregnant?

08:09.290 --> 08:12.620
This is good.
This is good stuff, Vinny.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.790
N-- No! No.
My parents have set up
an arranged marriage.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.380
My future wife Raya,
she's flying in
from Mumbai,

08:18.380 --> 08:19.710
and we're all getting dinner
tomorrow night.

08:19.710 --> 08:25.290
An arranged marriage?
Oh my god, Gabi,
I've found my hook.

08:25.290 --> 08:28.120
So, you're gonna marry someone
you've never met
when you're in love

08:28.120 --> 08:29.960
with somebody else?
I mean, you need
to get back

08:29.960 --> 08:31.620
with your someone else.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.330
I have a question...
why do you care?

08:33.330 --> 08:35.380
Because if you love Marissa,
you need to be with her.

08:35.380 --> 08:38.080
The people that belong together
need to be together!

08:40.120 --> 08:43.250
Look, my parents scare me.
They don't even know
that I smoke pot.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.460
You're not gonna tell them,
are you?

08:46.460 --> 08:49.620
No, but you might wanna
hide this bong.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.170
Hey... Vinny...
I wonder what would happen

08:52.170 --> 08:54.500
if you told your parents
that you love Marissa?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.420
It's cool that I'm having
this pizza, right?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.670
It doesn't matter
who I love.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.620
What matters
is who they love,
and they love Raya.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.290
Well, how do you know
they're gonna love Raya?

09:03.290 --> 09:04.580
I mean, they haven't even
met Raya.

09:04.580 --> 09:07.540
Oh...
they're gonna love her.
She is a virgin vegetarian

09:07.540 --> 09:10.000
chemical engineer,
it's the Indian trifecta.

09:11.580 --> 09:16.330
Indian trifecta!
That's good stuff.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.620
Vinny...

09:22.620 --> 09:26.540
what if the Raya they meet
is actually... none
of those things?

09:26.540 --> 09:30.000
What if she's a--
What if she's a sex-loving,
meat-eating,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
not-a-chance-in-hell-
of-being a chemical engineer?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.500
Ohhh... I see
what you're doing.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.420
You're gonna
get some girl to pretend
to be a horrible version

09:36.420 --> 09:39.210
of Raya,
so that his parents...

09:44.330 --> 09:45.830
It's me, isn't it?

09:50.750 --> 09:55.920
Thank you so much
for getting all the snacks ready
for my date with Marissa.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.380
Did you hear that?
"Date... with Marissa."

09:59.380 --> 10:01.580
Date... with someone
who's not Gabi.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.710
When's the last time
you heard me say that?

10:05.210 --> 10:07.420
About three minutes ago.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.540
Look... that's because
I'm excited!

10:10.540 --> 10:12.500
You know, technically,
Gabi and I aren't even dating,

10:12.500 --> 10:15.500
we're just having sex,
which, don't get me wrong,
it's nice.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.750
It's nice.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.540
But I'm a man.

10:19.540 --> 10:22.290
I want relationships,
I want feelings,
I want emotions!

10:22.290 --> 10:23.540
I miss 'em.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.330
And I'm the gay one?
(laughs)

10:27.330 --> 10:28.920
Ow, ow, ow... oh.

10:31.580 --> 10:34.040
So, you talked to Gabi
about this, and you're sure

10:34.040 --> 10:35.250
this is what you wanna
be doing?

10:35.250 --> 10:37.210
Of course this is
what I should be doing!

10:37.210 --> 10:38.420
This is good!

10:38.420 --> 10:39.500
This is what normal people do!

10:39.500 --> 10:40.670
They go out! They date!

10:40.670 --> 10:42.500
They pretend to be
someone they're not!

10:42.500 --> 10:46.380
Then they get more comfortable.
Eventually, they pee in front
of each other, it's beautiful!

10:49.210 --> 10:50.880
Gabi and I can't
have a relationship like that.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.380
We tried, but we can't.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.540
I'd love it, but we can't.
So will you get off my back?

10:55.920 --> 10:58.500
(phone chimes)

10:58.500 --> 11:00.710
That... is Marissa.
I'm gonna go
and let her in.

11:00.710 --> 11:02.670
You guys open the wine,
put on the terrace lights,

11:02.670 --> 11:04.620
make everything look pretty,
and get out.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.290
-(chirping)
-Aah!

11:09.290 --> 11:10.290
(plate hitting floor)

11:18.080 --> 11:19.790
Hurry, Yolanda!

11:19.790 --> 11:23.460
(squirrel chirping)
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

11:23.460 --> 11:24.330
I got you!

11:24.330 --> 11:26.540
You furry little bitch!

11:26.540 --> 11:28.000
What the hell
is goin' on in here?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.920
The squirrel is real!

11:31.290 --> 11:33.380
And it's right here
under this bucket!

11:33.380 --> 11:34.540
Ohh, is it, Elliot?

11:34.540 --> 11:37.040
Or did you just
take more of your meds?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.000
I'm telling you,
it's right here.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.580
Well, let's see it, then.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.120
You kick the bucket...
and I'll grab the squirrel.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.170
Okay.

11:47.170 --> 11:48.420
Naa!

11:50.210 --> 11:52.210
What the--?

11:52.210 --> 11:54.210
I'm telling you
it was right here!

11:55.540 --> 11:57.460
What's the matter with me?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.580
Help me, Yolanda!
(crying)

12:02.580 --> 12:05.380
I think I might
be losing my mind.

12:05.380 --> 12:06.960
(crying)

12:08.420 --> 12:09.830
(crying)

12:14.330 --> 12:16.250
How about
we get some frozen yogurt?

12:21.460 --> 12:23.540
Gabi, are you sure
Sofia's gonna be able
to pull this off?

12:23.540 --> 12:25.380
If my parents find out
that she is not the real Raya--

12:25.380 --> 12:27.250
(knocking on door)
That's them!

12:29.210 --> 12:31.620
They are not gonna find out.
Okay, by the time
this night ends,

12:31.620 --> 12:33.120
you're gonna be done
with Raya.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.170
Up high-a!

12:37.710 --> 12:39.420
Mom! Dad!

12:39.420 --> 12:41.290
You look so handsome!

12:41.290 --> 12:42.580
Who is this?

12:42.580 --> 12:45.380
Oh... um, I'm Gabi,
I'm your personal chef
for the evening.

12:45.380 --> 12:50.080
Oh, you hired
a personal chef?
That will impress Raya.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.620
Good thinking, Navin.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.170
Uh... Dad, please
call me Vinny.

12:54.170 --> 12:55.380
All my friends
just call me Vinny.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.960
Not us. Your name is meant
to appear on a Hindu temple,

12:57.960 --> 13:01.040
not a pizza box.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.500
(phone ringing)

13:03.500 --> 13:05.920
Excuse me one second.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.460
Where are you. So-- Raya?

13:09.460 --> 13:13.120
-Gabi, meet me in the hallway.
-No! Just knock on the door
like we planned!

13:13.120 --> 13:15.710
-Meet me in the hallway now!
-Fine!

13:15.710 --> 13:18.250
(laughs)
I'll be right back!

13:18.250 --> 13:20.460
Have a samosa.
And a mimosa.
(laughs)

13:22.620 --> 13:25.210
-Hey... what's going on?
-Gabi, I'm sorry--

13:25.210 --> 13:29.080
No, no... don't be sorry.
Be in a sari!

13:29.080 --> 13:31.750
Look, I thought about it,
and I just can't do it.

13:31.750 --> 13:35.460
Dressing up like an Indian girl,
faking an Indian accent.
It's wrong and it's offensive.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.420
It was for your article!

13:38.420 --> 13:40.250
And you already have
a really great title,
I mean,

13:40.250 --> 13:43.250
"My-- My-- My Big Fat
Arranged Indian Wedding"?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.830
Come on,
that story's totally gonna
make the front page.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.000
Of what? Racist Monthly?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.880
Okay... I need you
to be bad Raya.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.710
Why? Because you still
have feelings for Josh?

13:52.710 --> 13:57.830
No, I-- For the gazillionth
time, my feelings for Josh
are none, okay?

13:57.830 --> 14:00.620
We tried to have a relationship,
but we can't!

14:00.620 --> 14:03.380
All right?
Wish we could, but we can't,
so get off my back!

14:04.710 --> 14:06.420
Is everything okay out here?

14:06.420 --> 14:08.880
Oh... she's pretty.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.380
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Jain,
I'm really sorry, but--

14:11.380 --> 14:14.330
Yes, uh, Raya here
is a very skittish
bride-to-be.

14:14.330 --> 14:16.790
-What?
-You are nervous
to meet us.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.920
Yeah, yeah, girl left her
bindi dot in the Uber.
(laughs)

14:20.920 --> 14:22.920
'Nuff said.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.420
-Okay, who wants Vindaloo?
-No no no no no no no...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.170
I can't believe we were gonna
watch The Fault in our Stars.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.250
Straight guys aren't usually
into chick flicks.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.380
You are straight, right?

14:34.380 --> 14:36.580
Hetero and sexual.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.710
I was just in the mood
for some feelings
and emotions.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.290
You know, which stars
are we talking about?

14:40.290 --> 14:43.670
Whose fault is it?
These are questions
I need answers to!

14:43.670 --> 14:46.880
I'm sorry, again,
for talking so much about Vinny
on the way over here.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.170
Look, it's only natural.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.210
Your relationship
just ended yesterday.

14:50.210 --> 14:53.250
Well, I won't
bring him up again,
I promise.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.620
It's just it was so dumb of me
to stay with him for so long!

14:55.620 --> 14:57.500
You know, I knew his parents
wanted an arranged marriage,

14:57.500 --> 14:59.670
so the relationship
was just supposed to be
about sex,

14:59.670 --> 15:01.170
but then the sex
turned into feelings,

15:01.170 --> 15:03.250
and feelings turned
into a relationship,
and now I'm devastated,

15:03.250 --> 15:05.250
and they better
have frickin' Skittles!

15:08.080 --> 15:09.750
I-- I get it.

15:09.750 --> 15:13.120
Look, I was in a sex-only thing
once that never...
turned into feelings.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.460
Really? How did it not?

15:14.460 --> 15:16.960
It just didn't, okay?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.210
(phone ringing)

15:19.080 --> 15:21.120
I'm sorry, it's a business call
from China.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.330
Uh, here, take my wallet.

15:23.710 --> 15:25.330
Wei, nin hao.

15:25.330 --> 15:26.670
Do you have a punch card?

15:26.670 --> 15:28.620
Uh... look at that.
He does.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.750
No... no no no no no,
what the hell are you doing?

15:33.750 --> 15:36.170
No, you can't punch this card!

15:36.170 --> 15:37.880
Oh my god, all the punches
are gone.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.120
Uh, isn't that a good thing?
Your next yogurt's free.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.000
No! There's no more punches
left, and when the punch card's
over, that means we're over,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.460
and I don't want us to be over,
I love her!

15:47.120 --> 15:49.080
Oh my god.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.620
I love her.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.790
I love her!

15:55.170 --> 15:56.330
I gotta go.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.830
Just so you know,
we're out of Skittles.

16:06.170 --> 16:10.290
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?
I am not Raya.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.830
We were in your position once.
We tried everything we could

16:13.830 --> 16:16.330
to convince our parents
we were a bad match.

16:16.330 --> 16:19.170
Look, I'm not Raya!
I-- I'm not even Indian,

16:19.170 --> 16:21.880
I'm Dominican!
My name's Sofia!

16:23.080 --> 16:25.000
She told my parents
her name was Becky.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.830
(laughs)
And-- And... I insisted
I was Canadian.

16:29.830 --> 16:31.460
How 'bout them
Maple Leafs? Ehh?

16:31.460 --> 16:33.330
(laughing)

16:33.330 --> 16:36.290
This is ridiculous.
Okay, look, you want proof
that I'm not Raya?

16:36.290 --> 16:40.620
Here, here's my birth control.
Says my name on it,
Sofia Rodriguez.

16:40.620 --> 16:44.250
And why do I have it?
Because I'm having sex.

16:44.250 --> 16:48.170
Not currently, but enough
to get a prescription.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.000
Navin, what's going on?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.880
Gabi, what's goin' on?

16:53.380 --> 16:57.080
What's going on is your son
doesn't wanna marry Raya!

16:57.080 --> 16:59.170
He's in love
with a girl named Marissa!

16:59.170 --> 17:01.040
Who's Marissa?

17:01.040 --> 17:03.540
Well, it's Vinny's soulmate.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.750
Listen, he never set out
to disrespect you.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.580
He told me when he first
started seeing Marissa,

17:07.580 --> 17:11.120
that he made it very clear
to her that they could never
have a relationship.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.880
It was purely sex.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.120
Oh... god! Oh god.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.960
Uh, but then...
I mean, something
unexpected happened.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.540
I mean, she tried to pretend
that it was just about sex,
but it wasn't.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.460
She had-- She had feelings
for him. I think she always did.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.040
But she was afraid to tell him,
because every time they told
each other

17:27.040 --> 17:28.670
that they had feelings,

17:28.670 --> 17:31.710
it would just ruin everything,
but she-- she does have feelings
for him, she does, I mean...

17:31.710 --> 17:33.000
I-- I think she loves him!

17:38.330 --> 17:43.330
Oh my god.
Sofia... is she me?
Am I in love with Josh?

17:43.330 --> 17:46.750
Oh my god, yes!

17:46.750 --> 17:50.120
Oh my god!
I'm in love with Josh!

17:50.120 --> 17:51.460
I gotta go.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.710
Okay, I don't wanna
make this awkward
or anything,

17:55.710 --> 17:59.080
but can you three smoosh,
'cause I need a picture
for my article. (laughs)

18:03.040 --> 18:04.750
And now you're doin' my job?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.830
How high are you?

18:09.170 --> 18:14.120
I can't believe I actually
thought there was a squirrel
in here.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.710
Oh... well, let's go home.
And give me those damn pills

18:17.710 --> 18:19.830
so I can get rid of them
once and for all.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.710
Hey.

18:40.710 --> 18:42.170
-You're home.
-Gabi, what are you doin' here?

18:42.170 --> 18:43.880
I needed to talk to you.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.290
I needed to talk to you, too.
I went to your place,
and you weren't there.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.620
Oh, yeah,
that's because I'm here.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.420
Um, I thought
you were on a date.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.580
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.080
-Gabi--
-Listen, um...

18:55.080 --> 18:57.750
Can I go first?
Because if I don't say
what I need to say,

18:57.750 --> 18:59.500
I might not say it.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.750
Okay, but... if I don't say
what I need to say...
I might not say it.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.540
Okay, but-- but...
what if what you need to say

19:05.540 --> 19:08.170
makes me not wanna say
what I need to say,
and then I might not say it,

19:08.170 --> 19:10.420
and I really need to say it,
and now I need to sit.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.580
Look, if you're not gonna say
what you need to say,

19:13.580 --> 19:15.830
I'm just gonna say
what I need to say.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.040
-Josh?
-Gabi?

19:19.040 --> 19:19.880
Both:
Fine, you go.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.120
No, you go.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.290
-Josh?
-Gabi?

19:22.290 --> 19:23.830
Stop!

19:23.830 --> 19:26.290
I know this is crazy,
and I know the punch card
was supposed

19:26.290 --> 19:27.920
to keep us
from having feelings
for each other

19:27.920 --> 19:29.040
because we're
horrible together.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.960
-Okay...
-But then you met Marissa,
and you put us on a hold,

19:30.960 --> 19:32.880
and I thought I was fine
with that, but really I wasn't.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.460
-Okay.
-And so I tried to break up
Vinny's arranged marriage

19:35.460 --> 19:38.540
by making Sofia pretend
she was Indian, which was really
culturally insensitive,

19:38.540 --> 19:41.670
but I only did it because--
-Because what?

19:41.670 --> 19:45.880
Because...
I love you.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.290
I love you.

19:48.670 --> 19:50.000
I love you.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.500
Your turn.

19:57.380 --> 20:01.170
Gabi... the reason I was racing
all over town trying
to find you...

20:01.170 --> 20:02.380
-is because--
-(squirrel chirping)

20:02.380 --> 20:03.420
Both:
Aagaahh!

20:03.420 --> 20:05.580
Ahh...

20:10.040 --> 20:14.210
Relax, Gabi...
the doctor said Josh
was going to be okay.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.880
Turns out
it's just a concussion.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.120
Okay, ladies... we're gonna
keep him overnight
for observation,

20:19.120 --> 20:21.500
and I'm gonna recommend
some pain medication.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.460
Oh, great! I'll pick it up.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.460
Good luck.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.790
You can see him now.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.880
-Hey.
-Oooh...

20:38.880 --> 20:40.170
Ooh.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.960
What happened?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.080
Well, uh...
you hit your head.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.920
When you saw the squirrel,
you jumped up, and you screamed,

20:47.920 --> 20:52.460
in a super manly
not-afraid-of-a-harmless-
creature kind of way.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.170
You okay?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.620
Yeah, I think so.

20:55.620 --> 20:56.790
Good, good.

20:56.790 --> 20:57.960
Listen, Josh,

20:57.960 --> 20:59.080
I know this could probably wait,

20:59.080 --> 21:00.210
but um...

21:00.210 --> 21:02.250
I kinda said something
really big

21:02.250 --> 21:04.000
right before
the squirrel happened,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.830
and, um...

21:05.830 --> 21:07.170
it was kinda really hard
for me to say,

21:07.170 --> 21:09.790
and I think I know
what you were gonna...

21:09.790 --> 21:11.500
say, but I'm-- I'm not sure

21:11.500 --> 21:12.620
that I know know

21:12.620 --> 21:13.750
what you were gonna say,

21:13.750 --> 21:14.880
so, um, could you...

21:14.880 --> 21:16.120
kinda say it right now?

21:17.170 --> 21:18.580
Could I ask you
a question first?

21:18.580 --> 21:19.830
Yeah, sure, anything.

21:21.790 --> 21:22.750
Who are you?
