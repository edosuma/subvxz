00:02.033 --> 00:03.816
Previously on <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>

00:03.840 --> 00:04.622
Is that for a club?

00:04.623 --> 00:06.490
Not a club so much as a party.

00:06.525 --> 00:08.759
I used to see your friend there.
Maya?

00:08.793 --> 00:11.428
Caleb: There's no more "A," so
why are you lying to me now?

00:11.463 --> 00:13.497
No more silence.
I'm done, Hanna.

00:13.532 --> 00:15.799
We were friends of Ali's.
Me too. I'm Cece.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.836
Come in and meet...
My mother. Hello.

00:18.870 --> 00:23.474
The board has decided to delay
any decision to transfer Mona.

00:23.508 --> 00:24.775
I'm not gonna ask you
to explain anything

00:24.809 --> 00:26.844
because you won't.
I'll find out for myself.

00:26.878 --> 00:28.579
Tell your mom we need you
to come in for a blood sample.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.548
My blood is not
on your evidence.

00:30.582 --> 00:33.551
Ashley: Why didn't you tell me Ted was a pastor?
You really like him!

00:33.585 --> 00:36.520
There can be real-world
compensations in your ending this.

00:36.555 --> 00:38.822
Do you mind if we try and break
into Maya's site? We have to.

00:38.857 --> 00:41.425
I heard that Caleb
was back from California.

00:41.493 --> 00:44.728
I could ask him for some tips on how to
get around a tough password. Go ahead.

00:44.763 --> 00:47.631
<i>At least one of us might be able
to be in the same room as him.</i>

00:47.666 --> 00:48.866
Caleb: We're in.

00:53.572 --> 00:55.706
Okay, I understand
you're really upset right now,

00:55.740 --> 00:58.442
but can you please
just look at this?

00:58.476 --> 00:59.877
It's a photo of Maya.

00:59.911 --> 01:01.779
Yeah, I saw it.

01:01.813 --> 01:04.447
I found it on her website
last night, Spence.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.550
Look. There is a stamp
on her wrist

01:06.585 --> 01:08.686
that matches the one Emily
remembers from that night.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.589
Holden really did see her there.
Yup.

01:11.623 --> 01:13.824
Why are you not
all go-go-gadget about this?

01:13.858 --> 01:16.827
This is big! This is a real link
between Maya and that night.

01:16.861 --> 01:20.664
Look! Aria, I can't do
this anymore, okay?

01:20.699 --> 01:22.700
I cannot keep running around
looking for clues,

01:22.734 --> 01:25.336
I can't spend hours
hacking into websites.

01:25.370 --> 01:28.639
Five days ago I literally
forgot to apply <i>to college.</i>

01:28.673 --> 01:30.741
Do you get that?

01:30.775 --> 01:32.676
Thanks.
Thanks.

01:32.711 --> 01:36.480
First I drive Toby
out of town, and now this.

01:36.514 --> 01:40.618
Hey, it was just the early admissions deadline.
You can still get in.

01:40.652 --> 01:42.453
It's gonna be okay.

01:42.487 --> 01:45.389
Upenn has been my dream school
since I was eight, Aria,

01:45.423 --> 01:46.657
and yesterday I found my dream

01:46.691 --> 01:48.726
crumpled up in
the bottom of a bag

01:48.760 --> 01:51.662
underneath my a.P. French
and my physics homework.

01:51.696 --> 01:55.499
Which, by the way,
I got a "b" on.<i>"B."</i>

01:55.533 --> 01:58.702
So no, everything is not
gonna be okay!

02:00.739 --> 02:02.673
I'm dropping my velma act.

02:02.707 --> 02:05.342
From now on, I'm Daphne.

02:05.377 --> 02:06.744
Because I have got
a boyfriend to get back,

02:06.778 --> 02:08.345
and I have a college
to get into.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.382
I think you're confusing
which Scooby-do character

02:11.416 --> 02:12.583
would have gotten into
an Ivy league.

02:12.617 --> 02:15.586
And both velma and Daphne
solve crime.

02:17.689 --> 02:20.724
Morning, ladies.
This belong to one of you?

02:20.759 --> 02:23.327
Yeah, that's mine.
Thanks.

02:23.361 --> 02:26.597
Sure. Upenn.
Who's applying?

02:26.631 --> 02:30.267
Not me, 'cause I'm going
to community college.

02:30.301 --> 02:32.636
She just missed the early
admissions deadline.

02:32.671 --> 02:35.606
Hey, you don't need early admissions.
You're a Hastings.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.410
If I can get in, you can get in.
You went to upenn?

02:39.444 --> 02:41.345
Okay, dial down the shock.

02:41.379 --> 02:43.380
No. No, it's just that
if you went,

02:43.415 --> 02:46.550
then maybe you know somebody that
I n talk to about my application,

02:46.584 --> 02:50.320
like a Dean or a Professor...
a janitor, even.

02:50.355 --> 02:52.356
Well, there is this party
tonight,

02:52.390 --> 02:54.425
some people I haven't seen
since high school.

02:54.459 --> 02:57.294
This guy Steven
is supposed to be there.

02:57.328 --> 03:00.597
Last I heard, he got a job working
for admissions after he graduated.

03:00.632 --> 03:02.332
At upenn?
Yeah.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.268
That is great.
That is awesome!

03:04.302 --> 03:05.602
Can we please go talk to him?

03:05.637 --> 03:08.272
I could just
bring my application...

03:08.306 --> 03:11.508
I really wasn't planning on going.
It's not really my scene.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.482
Oh. You're not gonna stop
staring at me like a lost puppy

03:18.516 --> 03:22.186
until I say yes, are you?

03:22.220 --> 03:24.221
Fine. We'll go.

03:24.255 --> 03:26.523
Meet me at seven
outside the boutique.

03:26.558 --> 03:28.292
Thank you <i>so</i> much.

03:28.326 --> 03:31.228
Okay. Bye, lovely.
Thank you! Bye.

03:31.262 --> 03:34.364
Well, look who just got
their wish, cinderella.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.633
You're gonna come too, right?
Hmm. Negative.

03:36.668 --> 03:40.604
I have gotta go
talk to Ezra after school.

03:42.474 --> 03:46.343
Officer maple: Sorry to bother
you this early, Mrs. marin.

03:46.377 --> 03:49.379
"Mrs. marin." That doesn't sound good.
Is Hanna home?

03:49.414 --> 03:52.349
She's getting ready for school.
What's going on?

03:52.383 --> 03:54.318
The judge signed
the court order.

03:54.352 --> 03:56.253
The department now
has the legal authority

03:56.287 --> 03:58.288
to compel Hanna to
provide a blood sample.

03:58.323 --> 04:01.291
Barry...
the sample will be tested

04:01.326 --> 04:03.427
to see if it's a match
with blood found on an anklet

04:03.461 --> 04:05.229
belonging to
Alison DiLaurentis.

04:05.263 --> 04:06.463
Lower your voice.

04:06.498 --> 04:09.166
Hanna has five days
to comply, Mrs. marin.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.534
You know how to reach us.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.409
Hanna: Mom,
did you see my hairbrush?

04:19.444 --> 04:21.445
Check the bottom drawer.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.391
( Beep, line ringing )

04:34.425 --> 04:36.293
Woman: <i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Hastings & reibman.</i>

04:36.327 --> 04:39.429
I need to speak to Veronica

Hey.

05:35.587 --> 05:37.387
Have you seen Spencer?

05:38.489 --> 05:40.224
No.

05:40.258 --> 05:41.491
Sorry.

05:46.297 --> 05:49.199
Can you give her this
when you do?

05:55.173 --> 05:58.242
It's the new log-in
for Maya's website.

05:58.276 --> 06:01.044
How's your mom doing?

06:01.079 --> 06:02.312
Better.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.382
How are you?

06:07.018 --> 06:08.252
I'm fine.

06:11.923 --> 06:13.657
Od.

06:18.696 --> 06:20.530
( Bell rings )

06:20.565 --> 06:22.566
Thanks for passing that along.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.501
Okay.

06:32.477 --> 06:33.744
( Cell phone chimes )

06:37.615 --> 06:40.350
Spencer:
<i>At closing time. Grille</i>

06:40.385 --> 06:43.387
go alone or Caleb pays.
A."

06:43.421 --> 06:44.688
What's at the grille?

06:44.722 --> 06:47.291
I don't know...
"a's" takeout?

06:47.325 --> 06:49.459
When did you get this?
This morning.

06:49.494 --> 06:53.297
I talked to Caleb
and then bam! The text.

06:53.331 --> 06:55.265
Do you think it was
because of Mona?

06:55.300 --> 06:58.468
"A" probably knows
made her stay at radley.

06:58.503 --> 07:01.638
Has wren said anything
about how she's doing?

07:01.673 --> 07:03.540
Oh... I-I don't know.

07:03.574 --> 07:06.276
I haven't talked to him
since then.

07:06.311 --> 07:09.346
You can't go.
It's not safe.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.515
Spencer, if it were
Toby being threatened...

07:11.549 --> 07:14.318
then I would hope that you
would tell me the same thing.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.552
Look, I've already lost
one person this week,

07:15.586 --> 07:17.487
and when Toby
come back to Rosewood,

07:17.522 --> 07:21.224
if he comes back,
it is in one piece, okay?

07:21.259 --> 07:23.694
So please promise me
that you will not go.

07:23.728 --> 07:26.496
Okay. I promise.

07:31.302 --> 07:32.636
Spencer: Wow.

07:32.670 --> 07:35.572
I haven't seen her smile
like that since Maya.

07:35.606 --> 07:38.675
So I take it we're still
not gonna tell her about

07:38.710 --> 07:40.711
getting into Maya's website.

07:40.745 --> 07:42.579
She deserves
a moment of happiness

07:42.613 --> 07:46.416
before we drag her down
the Maya wormhole.

07:46.451 --> 07:49.653
Aria thinks it's a sign
of them that nigigight-d

07:49.687 --> 07:52.289
like the universe just
wants her to be happy.

07:52.323 --> 07:54.658
The universe is
a finicky little bastard.

07:54.692 --> 07:56.760
Hey.
Hey. Hi, Paige.

07:56.794 --> 07:58.762
Hey.
How's it going?

07:58.796 --> 08:01.431
Uh, it's... Good.

08:01.466 --> 08:03.266
Yeah. It's great.

08:04.736 --> 08:06.570
Great.

08:06.604 --> 08:08.338
Yeah.

08:08.373 --> 08:11.608
Emily: Um, okay.
See you later.

08:11.642 --> 08:14.344
Man: <i>You can't pretend</i>
<i>this isn't happening!</i>

08:14.379 --> 08:16.613
Ezra: <i>No, but I can</i>
<i>kick you out of my apartment.</i>

08:16.647 --> 08:19.549
<i>It's great that you have principles,
but you're only hurting yourself.</i>

08:19.584 --> 08:21.385
I'm serious. Get out.

08:21.419 --> 08:23.387
Dude, don't be an idiot.
Take the offer!

08:23.421 --> 08:25.455
I'm not gonna...

08:27.291 --> 08:29.559
you Aria?
Not now, wes.

08:29.594 --> 08:31.595
Dude, introduce me.

08:31.629 --> 08:33.730
Dude, keep walking.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.504
And that was?

08:40.538 --> 08:43.640
That's Wesley.
My brother.

08:56.021 --> 08:57.922
What offer was
he talking about?

08:57.957 --> 08:59.824
Nothing.

08:59.859 --> 09:02.794
Ezra, I could hear you two
yelling from the stairwell.

09:02.828 --> 09:05.597
Clearly you're upset... I meant it.
It's nothing you need to worry about.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.635
How much money is your mom gonna
pay you to break up with me?

09:10.669 --> 09:12.771
Why would you ask that?

09:12.805 --> 09:14.939
Because she offered it
to me first.

09:14.974 --> 09:18.777
The other day at the museum my mother
offered you money to break up with me?

09:18.811 --> 09:20.879
That's what I came here
to tell you.

09:23.849 --> 09:24.916
( Sighs )

09:24.950 --> 09:27.652
I'm sorry, I'm just...

09:27.686 --> 09:29.554
Processing.

09:30.689 --> 09:32.857
Well, can you please
process out loud?

09:32.892 --> 09:34.626
Why was your brother here?

09:34.660 --> 09:38.596
He came to help buy back
the car I sold.

09:38.631 --> 09:39.764
Why?

09:39.799 --> 09:42.801
It's complicated

09:42.835 --> 09:44.803
I can keep up, Ezra.

09:44.837 --> 09:47.705
Technically, the jag
wasn't mine to sell.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.741
My grandfather left it to me,

09:49.775 --> 09:52.911
but because I disowned my inheritance,
it defaulted to my brother.

09:54.847 --> 09:56.748
About a month ago
I needed money,

09:56.782 --> 09:59.818
so I called wes and he said
I could sell the car

09:59.852 --> 10:01.886
and keep the cash.

10:01.921 --> 10:04.522
Okay, so...?

10:04.557 --> 10:06.458
So...

10:06.492 --> 10:08.560
My mother found out,

10:08.594 --> 10:11.663
and she's now claiming it's a
sentimental family heirloom.

10:11.697 --> 10:14.566
Oh, because she is
just sentimental.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.634
I have to buy the car back,

10:16.669 --> 10:18.903
and now the guy
is asking for double.

10:18.938 --> 10:22.740
Which means I have to borrow...
From her.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.678
I have to meet somebody
about the car.

10:26.712 --> 10:29.647
Right now?

10:29.682 --> 10:31.583
Yeah.

10:34.553 --> 10:35.820
Okay...

10:38.757 --> 10:40.725
( door closes )

10:42.828 --> 10:44.596
( Bell rings )

10:46.599 --> 10:48.733
( Cell phone rings )

10:52.638 --> 10:54.539
( Ringing stops )

10:55.708 --> 10:57.709
Han? Hey, wait up.

10:57.743 --> 10:59.577
Hey. Where's Paige?
Headed home.

10:59.612 --> 11:00.845
We're gonna meet up later.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.448
Look, I know you're not
telling me something.

11:03.482 --> 11:05.884
I haven't heard an update about
Maya's website in a few days.

11:05.918 --> 11:07.752
If it even <i>is</i> Maya's.

11:07.786 --> 11:10.622
I mean, we always knew that
Mona might be playing a trick,

11:10.656 --> 11:12.690
and if that's what
you guys aren't telling me...

11:12.725 --> 11:13.858
this isn't a trick.

11:13.893 --> 11:16.494
Then what is it?
Do you know?

11:16.529 --> 11:19.731
Caleb found a way
around the password.

11:19.765 --> 11:22.433
It's this site
where Maya kept stuff.

11:22.468 --> 11:26.504
Photos, blog entries,
videos...

11:26.539 --> 11:27.906
videos of what? Of Maya?

11:27.940 --> 11:29.941
And one she took of you.

11:31.544 --> 11:33.478
How long have you...
a few days.

11:33.512 --> 11:35.446
And you kept it from me?

11:35.481 --> 11:37.615
She was my girlfriend.
How could you keep this from me?

11:37.650 --> 11:39.551
Because we saw how happy
you were with Paige,

11:39.585 --> 11:42.921
and we couldn't bring ourselves
to ruin that.

11:42.955 --> 11:47.592
Come on, em, at least one of us
deserves to be happy.

11:47.626 --> 11:49.894
Look, I know you're
trying to protect me,

11:49.929 --> 11:53.665
but it's not up to you. I don't
appreciate being lied to.

11:53.732 --> 11:56.868
You're right,
and... I'm sorry.

12:00.940 --> 12:03.808
Here's the log-in info
for Maya's website.

12:03.842 --> 12:07.679
I can look at it with you,
if you want.

12:07.713 --> 12:10.782
No. I... Want to
do it on my own.

12:34.807 --> 12:36.608
Ashley.

12:36.642 --> 12:37.742
Hi.
Hi.

12:37.776 --> 12:40.712
So, what brings you
to my neck of the woods?

12:40.746 --> 12:44.549
Just a few errands.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.585
Maybe we could grab coffee sometime.
I should get going.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.788
We should.
Coffee would be great.

12:50.823 --> 12:52.857
Okay.
Okay.

12:52.891 --> 12:54.859
Well, it was nice seeing you.
You too.

12:54.893 --> 12:56.628
Bye.

13:06.438 --> 13:08.640
He basically kicked me out.

13:08.674 --> 13:10.742
He did <i>not</i> kick you out, okay?

13:10.776 --> 13:12.844
He had someplace to go.

13:12.878 --> 13:15.680
I'm kind of lying here
despondently right now, Spence.

13:15.714 --> 13:18.416
Well, can you just sit despondently?
I need the bed.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.585
No. Lying is
more despondent.

13:20.619 --> 13:21.719
Please?

13:21.754 --> 13:23.788
(Sighs) Okay, fine.

13:23.822 --> 13:26.624
Show me options.
Okay.

13:27.793 --> 13:30.395
Gray... Or blue?

13:30.429 --> 13:32.664
Definitely neither.

13:32.698 --> 13:35.533
These are my most
collegiate-looking blazers.

13:35.567 --> 13:37.468
You did not just say that.

13:37.503 --> 13:40.505
Spencer, you're going
to meet this upenn guy

13:40.539 --> 13:42.774
at a party
on a Friday night, okay?

13:42.808 --> 13:45.677
So I really don't think that
the attire is business formal.

13:45.711 --> 13:49.614
Did I mention how happy I am
that you're coming with me?

13:49.648 --> 13:54.786
You mean you don't want to go alone to some
random party with a 22-year-old stranger?

13:54.820 --> 13:57.488
She is <i>not</i> a stranger.

13:57.556 --> 13:59.757
She is Ali's older, gorgeous,

13:59.792 --> 14:02.460
very well-connected friend
that...

14:02.494 --> 14:04.429
Somehow we never
knew anything about.

14:04.463 --> 14:08.399
Yeah. Ali would have dangled her in front
of us like a pair of diamond earrings.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.702
Why didn't she?
I don't know.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.540
Is that your <i>mother's?</i>

14:15.574 --> 14:16.674
No!

14:17.676 --> 14:20.344
Maybe.

14:20.379 --> 14:22.447
Help!

14:22.481 --> 14:23.748
Please.

14:32.424 --> 14:34.525
Perfect. You can wear this.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.660
Wow.

14:44.503 --> 14:47.438
You and Ezra are gonna be fine.

14:47.473 --> 14:49.574
I promise.

14:49.608 --> 14:52.410
If you say so.

14:52.444 --> 14:53.478
His family is...

14:53.512 --> 14:55.713
look, I get it, okay?

14:55.748 --> 15:00.785
My Nanna once offered me $200 to shave
my father's sideburns in his sleep

15:00.819 --> 15:04.589
because apparently they were
an affront to his upbringing.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.491
( Laughing )

15:06.525 --> 15:10.528
And he still has a scar
really close to his ear.

15:10.562 --> 15:12.430
You actually did it?

15:12.464 --> 15:15.566
I was ten! That was like
a million dollars back then!

15:15.601 --> 15:18.669
Are you kidding?
Oh, my God.

15:18.704 --> 15:21.339
I'd do it again.

15:21.373 --> 15:22.807
( Both laugh )

15:25.811 --> 15:29.547
Spencer: So they're coming back
to a party at Rosewood?

15:29.581 --> 15:32.416
You never know
what you're gonna get.

15:32.451 --> 15:35.686
People either love you or
they don't remember your name.

15:35.721 --> 15:38.322
Look at Jason...

15:38.357 --> 15:40.558
he won't return my phone calls,
and we dated for how long?

15:40.592 --> 15:43.795
Jason's just going through
a really rough time right now.

15:43.829 --> 15:45.396
Apparently.

15:46.832 --> 15:48.766
Wait. I've been here
before.

15:48.801 --> 15:52.470
We both have.
This is Noel kahn's cabin.

15:52.504 --> 15:54.739
Yeah, Eric does have a
little brother, doesn't he?

15:54.773 --> 15:57.542
Tell me, does douchebaggery
run in the family?

15:57.576 --> 15:59.744
(Humorless chuckle)
Is Noel gonna be here?

15:59.778 --> 16:02.647
I'm betting he doesn't thi <i>we</i> are.
Something wrong?

16:02.681 --> 16:06.651
No. Nothing. Just...
Weird history with Noel.

16:06.685 --> 16:09.520
What kind of weird history?
They used to date.

16:09.555 --> 16:11.556
I wouldn't exactly call
it... it ended really badly.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.724
Oh, so it does
run in the family.

16:13.759 --> 16:16.761
Listen, I understand the
hex of the ex, <i>believe</i> me.

16:16.795 --> 16:19.497
But Noel's gonna be one of two
hundred people at this party,

16:19.531 --> 16:20.765
if he even shows.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.567
And we drove all this way,

16:22.601 --> 16:26.304
so I say we go in, find Steven
and give him your application,

16:26.338 --> 16:29.574
and if it's totally awkward
we can bail, okay?

16:29.608 --> 16:31.642
Cece Drake.

16:31.677 --> 16:33.711
And I brought friends.

16:42.588 --> 16:43.688
Stamp me.

16:52.631 --> 16:53.731
Thanks.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.988
I cannot believe this is
where the stamp was from.

17:04.021 --> 17:06.123
Yeah. Everybody here
is Eric's age.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.958
What would Maya be
doing with this crowd?

17:07.992 --> 17:09.692
Yeah. Who was that guy

17:09.708 --> 17:12.676
with the stamp at the diner the
night that Ali's grave was dug up?

17:12.711 --> 17:14.078
Oh, my God.

17:14.112 --> 17:16.814
Maybe I should have
brought two.

17:16.848 --> 17:19.116
Maybe you should have just
left it in the car. What?

17:19.151 --> 17:21.919
I'm sorry, but... Hello?

17:21.953 --> 17:23.087
Cece: Ladies.
I know.

17:23.121 --> 17:24.855
Did you find Steven?

17:24.890 --> 17:29.093
Hon, you gotta meet the guy before
we shove your stuff in his face.

17:29.127 --> 17:32.129
Don't worry. I'll get it
where it needs to go.

17:32.164 --> 17:34.699
Game room. Follow me.

17:41.173 --> 17:45.676
Maya (Video): <i>This one's
called "that night."</i>

17:45.711 --> 17:48.913
<i>Dire moments,</i>
<i>last good-byes,</i>

17:48.947 --> 17:51.782
<i>your kisses dance</i>
<i>like fireflies.</i>

17:51.817 --> 17:55.720
<i>I'm gone tonight</i>
<i>to a dark unseen</i>

17:55.754 --> 17:58.055
<i>a wish to take</i>
<i>your light with me</i>

17:58.090 --> 18:01.859
<i>you were my first,</i>
<i>but it won't be our last</i>

18:01.893 --> 18:05.763
<i>time travels till</i>
<i>it's in the past</i>

18:05.797 --> 18:09.133
<i>you'd think our love</i>
<i>was some thickening plot...</i>

18:12.137 --> 18:14.972
<i>they don't know</i>
<i>that it's all we've got</i>

18:22.047 --> 18:25.683
Cece: Looks like Eric kahn's
still playing truth or dare.

18:25.717 --> 18:28.986
Okay, it's official: You were
right about the blazers.

18:31.723 --> 18:33.657
Cece Drake...

18:33.692 --> 18:35.760
Back from the dead.

18:35.794 --> 18:37.828
How the hell are you?

18:37.863 --> 18:40.931
Worse, now that I'm seeing you, Eric.
But thks for asking.

18:40.966 --> 18:43.033
That's no way
to treat the host.

18:43.068 --> 18:46.036
Hmm. But you've brought
a virgin sacrifice,

18:46.071 --> 18:47.938
so all is forgiven.

18:47.973 --> 18:50.741
These are my ducklings,
so play nice.

18:50.776 --> 18:52.643
You're mean when you're cute.

18:53.879 --> 18:56.881
Only rule of the game room is
you gotta play to stay.

18:56.915 --> 18:59.950
Other than that,
dad's finest is right here.

18:59.985 --> 19:01.852
Help yourself.

19:03.822 --> 19:07.558
Doesn't look like
Steven's here yet.

19:07.592 --> 19:09.593
Don't worry, he will be.

19:09.628 --> 19:11.562
Relax, take a load off.

19:11.596 --> 19:14.832
Can I make you a drink?
Uh, no, thank you.

19:14.866 --> 19:16.801
No one's gonna narc on you.

19:16.835 --> 19:19.603
I've seen cops do way worse
in this room.

19:19.638 --> 19:21.806
Yeah. Still no.

19:25.844 --> 19:26.911
Hmm.

19:29.648 --> 19:32.850
Oh. Girl in bra,
boy in boxers.

19:32.884 --> 19:34.985
Did we skip truth and head
straight to dare, or...?

19:35.020 --> 19:39.757
Stephanie was warm,
Alex was being Alex.

19:39.791 --> 19:43.727
Well, in that case, I challenge
you to a round of truth.

19:43.762 --> 19:47.031
All right, Cece. We're playing
one-on-one truth rounds.

19:47.065 --> 19:49.867
You get caught in a lie,
it's sayonara, sweetheart.

19:49.901 --> 19:53.737
This ain't my first rodeo,
Eric.

20:02.047 --> 20:04.048
It's your last night on earth.

20:04.082 --> 20:07.852
Who in this room
do you sleep with?

20:12.691 --> 20:14.658
Suraci.

20:14.693 --> 20:16.827
No one deserves
to die a virgin.

20:25.070 --> 20:28.606
Where are you going? I was
just about to make dinner.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.808
The grille.
Aria and I have plans.

20:30.842 --> 20:33.010
I bought stuff
for chicken parmesan.

20:33.044 --> 20:34.678
You did?

20:34.713 --> 20:36.680
I wanted to make us dinner.

20:36.715 --> 20:39.950
Okay, you only cook when you
have to tell me something.

20:39.985 --> 20:41.852
No I don't.

20:46.691 --> 20:47.825
( Sighs )

20:52.931 --> 20:56.700
The police came by this
morning with a court order.

20:56.735 --> 20:59.737
But I don't you to worry.

20:59.771 --> 21:03.707
Spencer's mom is on it, and she's
assured me that you're gonna be fine.

21:03.742 --> 21:06.710
But I just wanted to tell you.

21:06.745 --> 21:07.845
Okay.

21:10.615 --> 21:13.680
Go ahead.
Say hi to Aria for me.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.101
Yeah. Thanks, mom.

21:19.024 --> 21:21.625
( Door opens, closes )

21:25.063 --> 21:27.064
( Dialing )

21:32.904 --> 21:35.773
Hi, Ted? It's Ashley.

21:35.807 --> 21:38.042
I know it's late, but...

21:38.076 --> 21:40.778
Have you eaten yet?

21:40.812 --> 21:43.581
Have you ever been arrested?

21:43.615 --> 21:46.984
Funny you ask that since you dared me
to steal a car last time we played

21:47.018 --> 21:50.788
and then called the cops.
I did, didn't I? Yep.

21:50.822 --> 21:52.790
Ever make a sex tape?

21:52.824 --> 21:56.694
Aria: I'm really starting to think
it was a bad idea that we came here.

21:56.728 --> 21:58.896
There is no way that
I'm playing truth or dare

21:58.930 --> 22:01.865
with a bunch of drunk,
horny college boys.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.602
Okay, shall we
go back upstairs?

22:04.636 --> 22:06.870
Yes... o-kay.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.942
Well, I guess <i>that's</i>
<i>to be expected.</i>

22:13.945 --> 22:16.614
Aria: Yeah,
but she's not.

22:16.648 --> 22:19.717
I think we just found
a reason to stay and play.

22:26.858 --> 22:28.759
Spencer: Noel kahn.

22:28.793 --> 22:31.729
Who invited you?

22:31.763 --> 22:34.565
Cece Drake.
You know her?

22:34.599 --> 22:37.701
Not as well as my brother does.

22:37.736 --> 22:39.703
So, you guys back together now?

22:40.839 --> 22:42.840
So many questions.

22:42.874 --> 22:44.708
I wouldn't mind a few answers.

22:44.743 --> 22:47.678
Then how about a game
of truth, Noel?

22:47.712 --> 22:49.780
We're up next.

22:49.814 --> 22:51.749
Me and Montgomery.

23:07.921 --> 23:10.589
Caleb, what are you doing?
You have to leave.

23:10.624 --> 23:11.691
Hanna, get in the car.
No. Listen to me.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.526
You have to go now, Caleb.
Please.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.696
Hanna, <i>I</i> sent the text.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.697
What?

23:17.731 --> 23:19.565
I'm "A."

23:19.599 --> 23:20.800
Get <i>in.</i>

23:30.230 --> 23:30.963
Caleb:
Hanna, look at me.

23:33.837 --> 23:35.176
Look, I know
that you're scared,

23:35.788 --> 23:37.496
but "A" isn't
going to find us out here.

23:37.508 --> 23:39.867
I'm not scared.
Okay, good.

23:39.892 --> 23:41.200
I'm freaking <i>out.</i>

23:41.944 --> 23:43.809
You think you know what's
going on, but you don't!

23:43.834 --> 23:45.805
You showing up to the grille
proves that I do.

23:45.829 --> 23:48.982
Oh, right. So you figured out
there's another "A" out there.

23:49.910 --> 23:52.579
Caleb, you don't even know
what that means.

23:52.613 --> 23:55.782
It means that you can
stop lying to me.

23:55.816 --> 23:59.552
We can be together.

23:59.587 --> 24:00.653
Hanna!

24:00.688 --> 24:03.823
Look, it's not that easy, Caleb.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.961
This person dug up a grave

24:07.995 --> 24:09.729
and stole a body.

24:10.998 --> 24:12.732
This person might
have killed Maya

24:12.766 --> 24:15.568
because she knew something
she shouldn't have.

24:17.276 --> 24:19.572
This person...

24:19.607 --> 24:21.841
What, Hanna?

24:21.876 --> 24:24.911
"A" ran your mom off the road.

24:24.945 --> 24:29.582
"A" flew to Montecito to scare the
crap out of me, and it worked.

24:29.617 --> 24:32.652
That's why I couldn't tell you
what was going on.

24:32.686 --> 24:35.822
I wanted to, but I <i>couldn't.</i>

24:35.856 --> 24:40.627
You think I would have just let you
walk out the door if I had the choice?

24:54.608 --> 24:56.910
Go. Where did you meet
your current boyfriend?

24:56.944 --> 25:02.048
At a bar. Did you ever invite Maya St.
germain to any of these parties?

25:02.082 --> 25:05.585
Geez, you're morbid.
This is a party, Aria.

25:05.619 --> 25:07.787
Ask me how many sexual partners
I've had.

25:07.821 --> 25:08.922
Just answer the question.

25:08.956 --> 25:11.958
She came to a few.
She had an open invite.

25:11.992 --> 25:13.726
You ever have sex
with your teacher?

25:13.761 --> 25:15.728
No. I never had sex
with my teacher.

25:15.763 --> 25:16.863
Bull.
It's my turn.

25:16.897 --> 25:18.531
How do you know Maya?

25:18.565 --> 25:20.733
Hot new girl
<i>and</i> she likes the ladies

25:20.768 --> 25:22.769
<i>and</i> she moves into
the DiLaurentis house.

25:22.803 --> 25:24.737
Everyone knew Maya.

25:24.772 --> 25:27.740
You ever frame anyone for, say,

25:27.775 --> 25:29.776
stealing answer sheets
to the mid-terms?

25:29.810 --> 25:32.545
Maybe you had access
to a certain teacher...

25:32.579 --> 25:35.782
that wasn't me. Where were you the
night that Alison's grave was dug up?

25:35.816 --> 25:37.817
Seriously? You're really
asking me that?

25:37.851 --> 25:39.986
I-I don't even know
what night that was.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.788
Friday right before labor day.

25:41.822 --> 25:44.657
I don't know.
I guess I was here.

25:44.692 --> 25:46.726
Eric: I can vouch for that.
He came,

25:46.760 --> 25:49.562
then... Showed,
and they left.

25:49.596 --> 25:52.031
You know I can see you now.

25:52.066 --> 25:53.666
Thanks, Eric.

25:53.701 --> 25:55.635
Anytime, bro.

25:55.669 --> 25:59.605
Why don't you tell us all
who your boyfriend is...

25:59.640 --> 26:04.577
And what he did for a living during the
first few months of your relationship?

26:04.611 --> 26:05.778
Jenna: It's okay, Aria.

26:05.813 --> 26:07.914
We already know the answer.

26:07.948 --> 26:09.882
( Timer beeps ) Time.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.751
You are so next.

26:16.824 --> 26:18.758
Spencer: Aria.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.527
Come on, talk to me.
Are you okay?

26:21.562 --> 26:23.963
I'm not going back in there.
I'm sorry, but I can't.

26:23.998 --> 26:25.932
You do not have to.

26:25.966 --> 26:29.635
I cannot believe I let Noel get to me
in a freaking game of truth or dare.

26:29.670 --> 26:32.772
What is this, sixth grade?
Not the way they play it.

26:32.806 --> 26:35.942
Listen, you did not say anything
that could get Ezra into trouble.

26:35.976 --> 26:37.577
Didn't I?

26:41.749 --> 26:42.982
What are you thinking?

26:43.017 --> 26:45.685
I'm thinking that
I know you want to leave,

26:45.719 --> 26:47.854
but I have to stay and find out what
else they know about that night.

26:47.888 --> 26:50.723
What they know,
or what they <i>did?</i>

26:50.758 --> 26:52.658
Cece:
There you guys are.

26:52.693 --> 26:55.028
Is everything okay, Aria?

26:55.062 --> 26:56.796
Things got a little
vicious in there.

26:56.830 --> 26:59.032
Ohh. You are so much
prettier than Jenna.

26:59.066 --> 27:02.702
Honestly, I don't get
what the fuss is about.

27:02.736 --> 27:03.936
Thanks.
Oh...

27:03.971 --> 27:05.705
Jenna just said
she's about to leave,

27:05.739 --> 27:08.941
so if you want to get that
round in, you better go quick.

27:08.976 --> 27:10.877
Aria:
I'll be fine, okay? Really.

27:10.911 --> 27:14.680
I've got a boyfriend on speed-dial
who can come and get me, so go.

27:14.715 --> 27:16.716
Go talk to her.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.754
( Ringing )

27:23.891 --> 27:25.792
Hello?
Aria: <i>Ezra?</i>

27:25.826 --> 27:27.693
Uh, no, sorry. It's wes.

27:27.728 --> 27:29.629
The brother.

27:29.663 --> 27:31.597
Hi, it's... it's Aria.

27:31.632 --> 27:33.666
Oh. The girlfriend.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.701
Yeah, that's me.

27:35.736 --> 27:38.838
Um, sorry, where is...
where is Ezra?

27:38.872 --> 27:42.642
Oh, right. Uh, he's sort of
being detained at the moment.

27:42.676 --> 27:44.911
<i>Detained? The dude who
bought the jag called,</i>

27:44.945 --> 27:46.612
and Ezra left to meet him.

27:46.647 --> 27:48.648
You want me to
tell him you called?

27:48.682 --> 27:51.717
Tell him I was wondering
if he could come and pick me up.

27:51.752 --> 27:53.920
I'm like 30 minutes
outside of Rosewood.

27:53.954 --> 27:55.955
Uh, sure, yeah.

27:55.989 --> 27:57.924
Um...

27:57.958 --> 28:00.526
What's the address?

28:00.561 --> 28:01.928
Sure, you're not a Saint.

28:01.962 --> 28:04.764
You just rescued a raccoon
with a broken leg.

28:04.798 --> 28:06.599
That was not about me
being a Saint,

28:06.633 --> 28:08.601
that was about me
being an <i>idiot.</i>

28:08.635 --> 28:10.837
That raccoon had rabies.

28:10.871 --> 28:12.638
( Laughs )

28:12.673 --> 28:14.841
More wine?
Mm-hmm.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.876
( Cell phone rings )

28:20.848 --> 28:23.783
I'm gonna need to take that.
I'm sorry.

28:25.919 --> 28:27.753
Hello.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.622
No, I am not fine.

28:29.656 --> 28:32.692
I have had enough of you targeting my daughter.
Detective wilden.

28:32.726 --> 28:35.795
If you so much as touch
one hair on her head...

28:40.801 --> 28:45.705
I am telling you, Noel, I am not gonna
be bullied by Spencer Hastings again.

28:45.739 --> 28:47.006
Come on.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.876
There's gotta be a few things
you're dying to ask her.

28:59.853 --> 29:01.721
I heard you were leaving.

29:01.755 --> 29:03.923
You heard wrong.

29:05.859 --> 29:08.895
Maya (Video): <i>I think Emily
has got a very old soul.</i>

29:08.929 --> 29:10.830
<i>I feel it when I kiss her.</i>

29:10.864 --> 29:15.535
<i>I can hear clocks all over
the world running backwards.</i>

29:17.538 --> 29:20.907
<i>If reincarnation exists,</i>

29:20.941 --> 29:24.577
<i>then Emily was once Cleopatra.</i>

29:26.647 --> 29:29.782
<i>Actually, no, I think she
proves reincarnation exists.</i>

29:29.816 --> 29:31.984
(Knock on door, door opens) <i>You can
definitely trace her back to the pyramids...</i>

29:36.623 --> 29:38.925
I'm sorry.
Your mom let me in.

29:41.828 --> 29:44.630
Why is your mother
defending a murderer?

29:44.665 --> 29:46.532
Because she thinks
that Garrett's innocent.

29:46.567 --> 29:47.934
Maybe Maya's murderer
is still at large.

29:47.968 --> 29:50.636
You don't think it's because
he started dating your sister?

29:50.671 --> 29:52.638
I think you're gonna
have to wait your turn.

29:52.673 --> 29:56.542
What you told us about Emily, you never
mentioned that Noel was with you that night.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.744
What else did you lie about?

30:02.883 --> 30:04.584
( Clears throat )

30:04.618 --> 30:08.754
You know what mutually assured
destruction is, right?

30:08.789 --> 30:12.525
You promised me something
the day I told you about Emily.

30:12.559 --> 30:14.727
Are you going to
keep that promise?

30:16.663 --> 30:18.598
Where did you find Emily?

30:18.632 --> 30:21.000
It's funny. I'm starting to wonder
where she was when <i>you</i> found her.

30:21.034 --> 30:24.637
Just answer the question. Noel: We
were trying to help your friend, okay?

30:24.671 --> 30:26.572
We saw her at some diner,
drunk off her ass...

30:26.607 --> 30:28.941
oh. So you found her in a diner,
not in the middle of the road.

30:28.976 --> 30:31.711
Well, the "drunk off her ass"
part is true.

30:31.745 --> 30:33.012
You get her that way?
No. Did you?

30:33.046 --> 30:34.847
No.
So why did you lie?

30:34.881 --> 30:38.651
I lied because I was
trying to protect someone.

30:38.685 --> 30:42.688
Isn't that why you lied
about your parents' lake house?

30:43.924 --> 30:46.859
Don't worry,
that was rhetorical.

30:46.893 --> 30:49.629
This isn't:
Where is the video?

30:49.663 --> 30:52.898
What video do you mean?
There is more then one.

30:52.933 --> 30:55.568
You know which one.
Where is it?

30:55.602 --> 30:56.769
It's safe.
Where?!

30:56.803 --> 30:58.871
I want to know
where Ali's body is,

30:58.905 --> 31:02.675
and if you can tell me that, you can
have all the damn videos you want.

31:02.709 --> 31:05.711
( Timer beeping )

31:05.746 --> 31:08.014
Oops.
Time's up.

31:26.587 --> 31:27.687
What are you doing here?

31:27.722 --> 31:29.723
Well, Ezra's really busy.
So...

31:29.757 --> 31:33.493
first you take his phone,
then you take his car...

31:33.527 --> 31:35.628
What's next?

31:35.663 --> 31:37.597
Actually, don't answer that.

31:40.801 --> 31:43.770
You mind if we
grab a bite on the way?

31:45.706 --> 31:48.541
What about Maya's website?
Caleb...

31:48.576 --> 31:49.709
if we figure out
who killed Maya,

31:49.744 --> 31:50.877
then we can figure out
who "A" is.

31:50.911 --> 31:53.513
I'm not going down
this road with you.

31:53.547 --> 31:55.682
Hanna, this could be somebody
that you were really close to.

31:55.716 --> 31:58.618
Another Mona.
Are you prepared for that?

31:58.652 --> 32:02.622
Caleb! This isn't easy
for me, either! All right?

32:02.656 --> 32:06.526
I have missed you so much, it's making
me do stupid things, crazy things.

32:06.560 --> 32:10.630
Hanna, you're talking to the guy who
just kidnapped his own girlfriend.

32:13.734 --> 32:16.569
And you know what?
For the record...

32:16.604 --> 32:19.706
I <i>am</i> going to help you stop "a."

32:19.740 --> 32:22.709
And I'm not asking
for your permission.

32:39.860 --> 32:42.729
Well, figured that out,
finally.

32:42.763 --> 32:44.597
( Eric, indistinct )

32:44.632 --> 32:47.734
Hey. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

32:47.768 --> 32:50.570
Oh. Oh.
Good luck.

32:50.604 --> 32:53.706
Okay, here I am.
What's wrong?

32:53.741 --> 32:55.475
What's wrong?

32:55.509 --> 32:57.644
Aria left, I don't know
anybody at this party,

32:57.678 --> 33:00.413
you're my ride, and I
couldn't find you anywhere.

33:00.448 --> 33:02.749
I was a little preoccupied.

33:02.783 --> 33:05.385
Okay. Why did you
really bring me here?

33:05.419 --> 33:09.589
There's no upenn guy who works at
admissions anywhere in this cabin.

33:09.623 --> 33:11.691
Was this just some excuse
so you could hook upith Eric?

33:11.725 --> 33:15.328
( Laughs ) Can I please just
have my application back?

33:15.362 --> 33:16.629
No, you can't.

33:16.664 --> 33:19.399
Steven has it.
What?

33:19.433 --> 33:21.568
You left the game room
after your round with Jenna.

33:21.602 --> 33:24.337
Steven showed up for all of
two minutes, slipped out.

33:24.371 --> 33:28.741
I gave him your application, I told him
how smart you are. We had a lovely chat.

33:28.776 --> 33:32.345
It's probably in the "on time"
pile as we speak right now.

33:32.379 --> 33:35.615
You had a lovely chat with
Steven about how smart I am.

33:35.649 --> 33:37.717
Yes.

33:37.751 --> 33:40.420
Okay, can we please
just get out of here?

33:40.454 --> 33:41.521
What?

33:41.555 --> 33:43.556
We both got
what we came for, right?

33:43.591 --> 33:45.458
So can we please just go?

33:45.493 --> 33:48.328
Yeah. Let's go.

33:49.797 --> 33:53.399
I can't thank you enough,
Veronica. Really.

33:53.434 --> 33:55.401
Okay, you too. Bye.

34:03.410 --> 34:06.412
So I guess it's too late
to open the red.

34:06.447 --> 34:08.447
Um, I'm sorry.

34:08.482 --> 34:11.417
It's just...
Idle hands.

34:11.452 --> 34:15.288
You're apologizing for
cleaning up my kitchen.

34:15.322 --> 34:18.458
Please, don't.

34:18.492 --> 34:21.594
I'm the one who's sorry.
I've ruined the evening.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.534
I guess you may have gathered
that wasn't my divorce lawyer.

34:28.569 --> 34:31.404
I've got one of those.

34:31.438 --> 34:35.542
They usually don't call at nine at
night asking about blood tests.

34:37.645 --> 34:40.612
This deranged cop
wants to get Hanna in trouble

34:40.648 --> 34:43.283
for something she couldn't
possibly have done.

34:43.317 --> 34:47.754
But he's already decided she's a criminal,
so who cares about probable cause?

34:47.788 --> 34:51.391
Sounds like Hanna's
gonna be okay, though.

34:51.425 --> 34:53.426
Yeah.

34:53.494 --> 34:55.661
Thank God.

35:00.367 --> 35:01.801
( Laughs )

35:03.470 --> 35:06.406
When you left
the church social that night,

35:06.440 --> 35:10.243
was it because you thought
I might judge you for,

35:10.277 --> 35:12.645
I don't know,
being... Human?

35:12.680 --> 35:14.480
I'm not a Saint.

35:14.515 --> 35:17.483
You know, police officers
aren't the only ones

35:17.518 --> 35:20.386
who make assumptions
about people.

35:20.421 --> 35:23.656
Just because
a man has been ordained...

35:29.663 --> 35:32.532
It's really was wonderful
seeing you.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.556
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
I'm really a nice person.

35:56.590 --> 35:58.591
You didn't give Ezra
the message, did you?

35:58.626 --> 36:00.593
If you were gonna wait
for him to get to you,

36:00.628 --> 36:01.728
you'd have been
waiting all night.

36:01.762 --> 36:03.496
I was just trying to help.

36:03.530 --> 36:07.233
Yeah, like you were trying
to help him out with the car?

36:07.267 --> 36:09.502
And now you're trying to help
your mom get him to buy it back?

36:09.536 --> 36:12.405
I know my family must seem
really weird and dysfunctional...

36:12.439 --> 36:15.475
no, I get dysfunctional.
I <i>have</i> dysfunctional.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.410
You people are hostile.

36:17.444 --> 36:19.278
You're throwing money around...

36:19.313 --> 36:22.415
I mean, these are people's real lives.
You know that, right?

36:24.385 --> 36:26.419
So he told you about Maggie.

36:28.489 --> 36:31.257
I didn't even find out
until recently.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.526
I was pretty young
when it happened.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.429
Ezra gets her pregnant,
wants to do the right thing,

36:36.463 --> 36:39.666
and then my mom shows up
with her magic purse strings.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.669
Whoosh!
There goes <i>th</i> problem.

36:42.703 --> 36:45.705
What do you mean,
"there goes that problem"?

36:45.739 --> 36:50.343
Mom made sure, you know,
she took care of it.

36:53.781 --> 36:56.649
Ezra didn't tell you
about that, did he?

36:58.385 --> 37:00.486
No, he did not.

37:03.424 --> 37:06.659
Is there any way you can just drive
this thing a little bit faster, please?

37:14.329 --> 37:15.187
I'm sorry.

37:23.377 --> 37:25.478
I just found out
about the website,

37:25.513 --> 37:28.448
and this was the first time
hearing her voice.

37:30.484 --> 37:35.121
My grandfather passed away
when I was fifteen.

37:35.156 --> 37:38.291
He had this outrageous
sense of humor.

37:38.326 --> 37:43.196
I mean, he would do anything
for a laugh.

37:43.230 --> 37:46.399
Last spring my mom
was cleaning out the basement,

37:46.434 --> 37:49.169
and she found
this old home video.

37:49.203 --> 37:51.438
My dad had bought her
a camcorder for Christmas,

37:51.472 --> 37:55.275
and everyone was passing
it around and being silly,

37:55.309 --> 37:59.479
and by the time it got
to my grandpa Allan...

37:59.513 --> 38:02.315
He just mooned the camera.

38:02.350 --> 38:04.117
( Both laugh )

38:04.151 --> 38:07.420
We're talking
70-year-old-man-butt, full frame,

38:07.455 --> 38:09.155
and there was a tattoo.

38:09.190 --> 38:11.224
Oh, my God, stop.

38:11.258 --> 38:13.326
It was a tulip.

38:13.361 --> 38:15.462
That's amazing.

38:15.496 --> 38:17.297
Yeah.

38:17.331 --> 38:21.334
And then he just
burst out laughing.

38:21.369 --> 38:24.270
The sound...

38:24.305 --> 38:27.240
It was like he was in the room.

38:27.274 --> 38:30.210
It was spooky, actually.
But...

38:30.244 --> 38:33.213
Also really good.

38:51.332 --> 38:54.200
I don't want it
to keep hurting.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.477
( Unlocking door )

39:07.114 --> 39:08.348
Good, you're back.

39:09.383 --> 39:11.317
Hey!

39:11.352 --> 39:15.422
I left my phone inside.

39:15.456 --> 39:19.225
Yeah, I know, I... Called you
for a ride and wes picked up.

39:19.260 --> 39:21.261
He told me about Maggie.

39:24.365 --> 39:26.433
Come inside.
I can't.

39:26.467 --> 39:29.202
You can't? I need to
know what happened.

39:30.504 --> 39:33.106
Well, I can't believe that wes
would tell you that in the first...

39:33.140 --> 39:36.109
he thought that I knew, Ezra. He
thought we were the kind of people

39:36.143 --> 39:38.244
who told each other things,
and so did I.

39:38.279 --> 39:42.182
So I need to hear the truth
from you, right now.

39:47.388 --> 39:48.421
( Gasps )

39:48.456 --> 39:50.323
Wait... no. Ar-Aria.

39:51.358 --> 39:53.326
Aria, wait.

39:57.198 --> 40:00.300
You got somebody
pregnant in high school?

40:00.334 --> 40:02.335
It was the summer
after graduation.

40:02.369 --> 40:05.271
Maggie.
What happened?

40:06.574 --> 40:09.476
My mom happened.

40:09.510 --> 40:14.214
She and I always saw things differently...
for as long as I can remember.

40:15.416 --> 40:18.184
But I was scared.

40:18.219 --> 40:20.453
Maggie was scared.

40:20.488 --> 40:23.356
We thought she could help.

40:23.390 --> 40:26.359
I told her about Maggie,
and she said that she'd...

40:26.393 --> 40:29.362
She'd handle it.

40:29.396 --> 40:31.498
Eighteen years old
and pregnant,

40:31.532 --> 40:34.400
and here's this woman
telling you how it's gonna be.

40:34.435 --> 40:38.171
Your mom offered her money?

40:38.205 --> 40:40.340
She was determined
to keep me on track,

40:40.374 --> 40:43.576
and that didn't include me
becoming a father at eighteen.

40:46.313 --> 40:47.413
Wow.

40:47.448 --> 40:49.449
That's one word for it.

40:51.519 --> 40:53.253
I was going to go to vassar,

40:53.287 --> 40:56.356
but then that suddenly
became too close to home,

40:56.390 --> 41:00.426
so I transferred to Hollis
and I became a Fitz.

41:00.461 --> 41:03.229
And Maggie?

41:04.465 --> 41:07.467
There were terms involved
with the money.

41:07.501 --> 41:10.436
They included never
talking to me again.

41:14.542 --> 41:17.210
Please come inside.

41:18.479 --> 41:20.580
Please.

41:27.521 --> 41:30.256
Okay.

It should be right here.

43:09.023 --> 43:12.191
I think you'll be
very happy with the unit.

43:12.226 --> 43:16.129
As long as you pay on time, you won't be
hearing from the landlord much, either.
