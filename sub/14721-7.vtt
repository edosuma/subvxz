Yeah.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.353
Wait. Why did Liam
give you an office?

01:02.353 --> 01:04.485
Well, he was so excited

01:04.485 --> 01:06.447
to have an agent
of my caliber in-house,

01:06.447 --> 01:09.320
that he insisted
I have a place to work.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.652
Remember our deal, Bernie.

01:11.652 --> 01:14.535
You can play
 pretend agent in here

as long as you
 keep the servers cooled.

01:17.698 --> 01:19.660
No, you're cool.

01:19.660 --> 01:22.413
He clearly didn't say that.

01:22.413 --> 01:25.376
Anyway...

03:26.667 --> 03:29.630
Maybe because his
heart feels backwards?

03:29.630 --> 03:32.883
It seems like his dares are
getting more and more dangerous.

 this deal, Bernie.

I'm a huge Bizaardvark fan.

04:17.637 --> 04:18.928
Well, you know what they say.

04:18.928 --> 04:20.801

comedy team

04:20.801 --> 04:22.763
is a handsome agent.

04:23.934 --> 04:27.478
I mean, uh,
tell me more about this deal?

04:27.478 --> 04:31.772
As network president, I can
 guarantee the girls their own
 TV show if they're interested.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.654
Oh, we're interested.

04:33.654 --> 04:35.776
See you in my office on Friday.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.610
And that's why they call me
the smoothest agent in town.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.703
(shatters)

04:43.744 --> 04:45.956
Wait, was that
a real network president

04:45.956 --> 04:48.579
talking about giving us
a real TV show?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.000
Oh... was it?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.962
Stop doing that.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.004
Bernie, we can't meet in here.

04:54.004 --> 04:55.916
This place is
an embarrassing dump

04:55.916 --> 04:58.549
and makes us look pathetic.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.801
But...

05:00.801 --> 05:03.844
This big shot TV dude
meets us in here,

05:03.844 --> 05:06.727
he's gonna think we're a joke,
and we'll lose this deal.

05:06.727 --> 05:09.019
Let's go talk to Liam
and demand a real office!

05:09.019 --> 05:13.564
Whoa. This place may be
a little rough around the edges,

05:13.564 --> 05:14.855
but it's a rock solid office--

05:14.855 --> 05:16.817
Oh, I went through the wall.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.034
Okay, Dirk,
this career test will tell us

05:24.034 --> 05:26.997
what other interests you might
have besides dangerous dares.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.710
Do we really have to do this?

05:29.710 --> 05:31.832
I don't think I live
that dangerous of a life.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.915
Well, let's just see...
Don't drink that,
that's liquid nitrogen.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.629
...what the test tells us.

05:38.629 --> 05:42.012
Okay, first question.
Do you have any long-term goals?

05:42.012 --> 05:46.887
I want to cannonball myself
from here to the Pacific Ocean.

05:46.887 --> 05:48.929
Any short-term goals?

05:48.929 --> 05:50.851
Buy a cannon.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.814
Doesn't have to be about dares.

05:53.814 --> 05:55.025
Do you have any likes?

05:55.025 --> 05:56.897
Dares.

05:56.897 --> 05:58.779
Dislikes?

05:58.779 --> 06:02.983
That feeling of
existential loneliness
we all get as human beings

06:02.983 --> 06:05.746
when we contemplate our
true place in the universe.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.988
Wow, Dirk. That was deep.

06:07.988 --> 06:09.830
Also not doing dares.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.582
And we're back.

06:12.993 --> 06:14.084
And finally,

06:14.084 --> 06:17.087
do you prefer to have a boss
or be your own boss?

06:17.087 --> 06:18.759
Have a boss.

06:18.759 --> 06:21.051
But he should tell me what to do
in a way that tells me

06:21.051 --> 06:22.923
he thinks I might not
be able to do it.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.805
So, a dare?

06:24.805 --> 06:28.058
I do like dares.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.059
(sighs)

06:29.059 --> 06:31.972
That's all 800 questions.

06:31.972 --> 06:34.815
Now let's enter your answers
and see the results.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.649
This test believes
you should be...

06:39.730 --> 06:41.902
a daredevil, stuntman,

06:41.902 --> 06:43.984
or librarian...

06:43.984 --> 06:45.906
who does dares on the side?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.988
How is that even an option?!

06:47.988 --> 06:50.741
Sweet! A toast to the results.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.743
And that's still
liquid nitrogen.

06:54.795 --> 06:57.668
By the way, do you have any more
of these fun puzzles I can do?

06:57.668 --> 06:58.669
What?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.802
Dirk, this is
my physics homework.

07:01.802 --> 07:04.094
Oh. I hope you're
not mad I did it.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.808
Oh, my gosh. You...

07:07.808 --> 07:09.970
You got every problem right.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.812
Dirk, you're a genius!

07:12.973 --> 07:14.645
I'm a what?

07:20.651 --> 07:23.774
I can't believe it.
How are you so good at physics?

07:23.774 --> 07:27.988
It's easy. You just
pop them in the microwave
until they're warm.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.871
Dirk, that's fish sticks.

07:31.912 --> 07:34.034
Who do you work for?

07:34.034 --> 07:36.997
Wait. It totally makes sense.

07:36.997 --> 07:38.959
To complete your dares,
you'd have to calculate

07:38.959 --> 07:41.712
an accurate
trajectory and velocity.

07:41.712 --> 07:45.005
Okay, Dareheads. I'm gonna
slingshot that watermelon

07:45.005 --> 07:46.927
into my head melon.

07:46.927 --> 07:48.138
Here we go!

07:50.000 --> 07:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:57.728 --> 08:01.101
All right, Dareheads,
today we're playing human pool.

08:01.101 --> 08:03.814
Dirk ball, corner pocket.

08:03.814 --> 08:04.815
Here we go!

08:14.164 --> 08:15.786
All right, Dareheads.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.789
Today I'm gonna cover
my entire body...

08:18.789 --> 08:20.080
in mustard!

08:20.080 --> 08:21.081
Here we go!

08:33.133 --> 08:35.135
Well, two out of three.

08:35.135 --> 08:37.847
So you've really
never studied physics?

08:37.847 --> 08:38.938
No.

08:38.938 --> 08:40.941
I guess it's just
something I picked up.

08:40.941 --> 08:44.024
Like eating, or calculus.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.986
You know calculus, too?!

08:45.986 --> 08:49.910
Nah. I just heard you say that
word during the career test.

08:49.910 --> 08:51.822
This is amazing.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.114
I gotta bring you
to the physics club
at my school.

08:54.114 --> 08:56.076
This could be
your true calling.

08:56.076 --> 09:00.080
I thought it was "quack-ulus,"
like duck math.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.753
Don't say that at Physics Club.

09:06.967 --> 09:10.841
I'm sorry. Why did you put
 these small pieces of wood

09:10.841 --> 09:12.883
under my wheels
 so I cannot move?

09:15.015 --> 09:17.177
Because Bernie would like
to give you a presentation

09:17.177 --> 09:19.139
about why
he deserves an office.

09:19.139 --> 09:20.771
Bernie.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.985
"Why I Should Be Able
to Swim Without Floaties--"

09:24.985 --> 09:27.988
Wrong presentation.
That was for my grandma...

09:27.988 --> 09:31.281
Let me just... exit out of this.

09:31.281 --> 09:33.033
(laughing)

09:33.033 --> 09:36.036
That's not--
Oh, that's going forward.

09:38.909 --> 09:41.201
Pl-- Please ignore that.

09:41.201 --> 09:44.915
And now my computer's frozen.

09:46.256 --> 09:48.168
I think I've seen enough.

09:48.168 --> 09:51.131
You've seen enough?
He made me take the pictures.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.265
Come on, Liam. Isn't there
a different office,

09:55.265 --> 09:58.018
like a studio
or conference room we can use?

09:58.018 --> 09:59.810
Don't worry.

09:59.810 --> 10:02.853
I think I have an idea
 that will satisfy everyone.

10:05.315 --> 10:07.187
Do you think Liam respects me?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.992
The head of a TV network
is coming here in two days.

10:11.992 --> 10:14.194
I don't wanna lose this deal.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.286
(wheels whirring)

10:16.286 --> 10:18.158
Listen.

10:18.158 --> 10:20.240
I think I can hear
Liam's office through the vent.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.952
How can you tell it's Liam?

10:21.952 --> 10:25.295
Liam:
 Ugh. I'm so unhappy.

10:26.837 --> 10:28.008
Just a hunch.

10:29.299 --> 10:31.051
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

10:33.253 --> 10:36.096

10:36.096 --> 10:38.929

10:38.929 --> 10:42.022
Paige Olvera? In Physics Club?

10:42.022 --> 10:45.936
That's like finding
a translucent body
in Babinet's Principle.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.028
(laughing)

10:49.980 --> 10:51.942
Yes, that's hilarious.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.273
And you know I don't get it.

10:55.075 --> 10:56.276
But I'm not here for me.

10:56.276 --> 10:59.119

will fit in with you guys.

10:59.119 --> 11:00.871
Whoo!

11:00.871 --> 11:04.044
Who ordered the Dirk burger,
with a side of Dirk fries,

11:04.044 --> 11:05.375
and a Dirk shake?

11:05.375 --> 11:10.000
See what I did there?
It's my name, with food.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.383
This... gentleman
comprehends physics?

11:13.383 --> 11:17.007
Tell me, what is the first
law of thermodynamics?

11:17.007 --> 11:21.301
Um, don't steal thermodynamics?

11:21.301 --> 11:23.974
Well, thanks for
wasting our time, Paige.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.896
Why don't you make like
a linear actuator--

11:25.896 --> 11:29.269
You can stop.
I'm not gonna get it.

11:29.269 --> 11:31.982
Can you please just
give him a chance?

11:31.982 --> 11:34.194
Dirk, you wanna
try a problem?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.235
Cool.

11:37.317 --> 11:39.239
This reminds me of a dare

11:39.239 --> 11:41.201
where I jumped
out of a hot air balloon.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.993
Really now?

11:44.204 --> 11:50.380
I know there's a fwoop
of like 9.81 thingamabobs.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.002
You mean gravity?

11:52.002 --> 11:55.045
Sure. We can use made-up words.

11:56.256 --> 12:00.220
Oh, and I know that it's
gonna take six here-we-gos

12:00.220 --> 12:03.343
before this object
falls at maximum fast.

12:03.343 --> 12:05.055
Terminal velocity?

12:05.055 --> 12:07.017
Yeah. Okay.

12:08.188 --> 12:12.312
Oh, and I know that the wham
is the same as, like,

12:12.312 --> 12:15.235
the Dirk weight
times the Dirk speed.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.988
That's Newton's
Second Law of Motion.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.991
Force equals
mass times acceleration.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.412
Sweet.

12:22.412 --> 12:26.366
So divide this bro,
carry this guy,

12:26.366 --> 12:31.171
and you get this dude.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.216
That's...

12:36.216 --> 12:38.378
actually correct.

12:38.378 --> 12:41.091
And he's never
even studied physics.

12:41.091 --> 12:43.053
Let me get this straight.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.305
You just intuitively
learned physics?

12:45.305 --> 12:48.228
The same principles that took
history's brightest minds

12:48.228 --> 12:50.060
centuries to discover?

12:50.060 --> 12:52.983
I can also fit these
outer space balls in my mouth.

12:56.316 --> 13:00.110
Would you like to stick around
and solve more problems with us?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.402
(mumbles)
I don't know...

13:02.402 --> 13:05.245
Come on, Dirk.
You're really good at this,

13:05.245 --> 13:08.248
and I bet you'll have fun.
Safe fun.

13:08.248 --> 13:10.250
Okay.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.505
Who wants to hear about
the time I shot out of
a giant syrup bottle

13:15.505 --> 13:19.469
into the world's biggest pancake
dressed as a blueberry?

13:26.386 --> 13:28.268
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

13:30.140 --> 13:32.232

If I knew why,
I wouldn't be asking!

13:36.316 --> 13:39.029
Uh, no... Ashley...

13:39.029 --> 13:42.072
I don't have time
for more kisses right now.

13:44.284 --> 13:46.446
Were you just in the wall?

13:46.446 --> 13:49.409
Yeah. I found a way through
the vents in Liam's office.

13:49.409 --> 13:51.251
Take a look at this.

13:51.251 --> 13:53.163

Well, better trouble afoot
 than trouble ahand.

14:02.132 --> 14:06.176
Haha! Ba-dum, ching,
 And the audience laughs.

14:09.059 --> 14:12.562
It would be a real shame
if this footage made it
onto the Internet.

14:12.562 --> 14:14.144
Right, Bernie?

14:14.144 --> 14:18.108
Why does Liam have an office?
He's a robot.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.359
Bernie, focus.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.481
And why is there
a turkey sandwich in here?

14:21.481 --> 14:23.283
And how is it half-eaten?

14:23.283 --> 14:24.444
Bernie!

14:25.485 --> 14:28.288
We'll delete this footage
on one condition:

14:28.288 --> 14:30.160
you give us this office.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.541
And this sandwich.

14:31.541 --> 14:32.542
I'm helping.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.376
Oh, boo and hoo.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.209
You think I'm scared
 of two tweenagers

14:39.209 --> 14:40.550
trying to blackmail me?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.265
Ladies and gentlemen!

14:45.265 --> 14:48.558
If you like pointing
and you like laughing,

14:48.558 --> 14:51.351
you're gonna love... Liam!

14:51.351 --> 14:53.353
Oh, I'm...

14:53.353 --> 14:55.435
All right, all right,
 all right, all right,
 all right, all right!

14:55.435 --> 14:57.437
All right, all right,
 I'll give you my office!

14:57.437 --> 15:01.441
Just don't show everyone.
It would be so embarrassing.

15:02.522 --> 15:05.115
Also, I was dreadfully off-key.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.294
Hey, Dirk, I got your text.
What's up?

15:14.294 --> 15:15.585
I think it's pretty obvious.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.538
Uh...

15:20.210 --> 15:22.212
I'm applying what I learned
in Physics Club

15:22.212 --> 15:24.214
to this dare that
I've been dying to do

15:24.214 --> 15:26.636
where I shoot myself out of
a nitrogen-powered launcher,

15:26.636 --> 15:28.548
onto a tiny trampoline,

15:28.548 --> 15:31.351
then bounce up
to dunk a basketball,

15:31.351 --> 15:34.474
all while hot coals are flung
at me by a pitching machine.

15:36.316 --> 15:36.977
Oh, man.

15:39.269 --> 15:44.324
But my calculations tell me
there's a 99% chance
I'll get hurt.

15:44.324 --> 15:45.565
You were right, Paige.

15:45.565 --> 15:48.158
I guess I shouldn't
do crazy dares anymore.

15:48.658 --> 15:50.410
Whoo!

15:50.410 --> 15:52.282
Who ordered the Kirk burger?

15:52.282 --> 15:55.245
With a side of Kirk fries?
And a Kirk shake?

15:55.245 --> 15:58.288
See what I did there?
I introduced myself.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.580
Hi, I'm Dirk's brother, Kirk.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.255
Dirk and Kirk?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.586
Do you have
a sister named Smirk?

16:06.586 --> 16:09.509
Who do you work for?

16:09.509 --> 16:13.263
So I take it you do dares, too?

16:13.263 --> 16:14.684
Haha! I wish.

16:14.684 --> 16:16.646
I could never do
what this guy does.

16:16.646 --> 16:21.401
I mean, look at me.
I'm not built for it.

16:21.401 --> 16:25.485
So, when's the big nitrogen-
launcher-trampoline-basketball
-hot-coals dare?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.367
Sorry Kirk, but...

16:27.367 --> 16:30.700
thanks to Paige, I'm not doing
dangerous dares anymore.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.492
Only safe ones.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.705
What have you done
to DareMeBro?!

16:35.705 --> 16:38.378
Now there's nobody to do
the leapfrog dare!

16:41.381 --> 16:43.253
Or the backflip dare!

16:44.624 --> 16:46.546
And there's not a person alive

16:46.546 --> 16:48.388
who can do
the banana split dare!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.594
You broke Dirk!

17:00.400 --> 17:02.442
So we totally blackmailed Liam,

17:02.442 --> 17:05.355
and now we get to use his office
for this big TV meeting.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.567
Oh, and guess where Liam is.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.358
(alarm blares)

17:09.358 --> 17:14.454
Servers overheating.
 Servers overheating.

17:14.454 --> 17:18.367
I have hit rock bottom.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.579
(laughing)

17:20.579 --> 17:22.752
That's hilarious.

17:22.752 --> 17:24.464
Speaking of funny stories,

17:24.464 --> 17:26.626
I helped Dirk
find a safer hobby,

17:26.626 --> 17:30.670
but now he's miserable
and has no zest for life.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.432
(laughs)

17:33.593 --> 17:35.675
-That's not funny.
-Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

17:37.437 --> 17:40.350
I don't know what to do.
I mean, Dirk's upset,

17:40.350 --> 17:42.682
but maybe that's okay,
'cause at least he'll be safe.

17:42.682 --> 17:45.605
But you made Dirk
give up the one thing
he loved most in life.

17:45.605 --> 17:48.608
Think how you would feel
if someone pushed us
to stop singing funny songs.

17:50.450 --> 17:54.284
This is a song about a Russian
farmer who worked for months,

17:54.284 --> 17:56.536
but could only
harvest one radish.

17:56.536 --> 17:58.698
And then...

17:58.698 --> 18:01.541
a bird took it.

18:01.541 --> 18:07.587
♪ It was another dark winter ♪

18:07.587 --> 18:10.340
♪ For Vladimir ♪

18:12.802 --> 18:15.305
You're right. I gotta fix Dirk.

18:15.305 --> 18:17.096
Wait. If we get this TV deal,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.768
what kind of a show
do you think we should do?

18:20.520 --> 18:23.393
Animated comedy
about dog valets.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.685
(gasps) We'll call it
"Parallel Barkers."

18:25.685 --> 18:27.317
Great. Go fix Dirk!

18:29.569 --> 18:31.441
There must be
 something in here

18:31.441 --> 18:34.614
I can use
to blackmail this little twerp.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.738
Bernie:

18:41.661 --> 18:45.665

Woman:
 How To Gain Self-Confidence.
 Chapter 43.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.512
By now, you've learned
 to start sentences
 with confident phrases

18:52.512 --> 18:54.384
like, "He-hey!"

18:54.384 --> 18:57.597
and punctuate wins
 with words like, "Yeah!"

18:57.597 --> 18:59.599
Yeah.

18:59.599 --> 19:02.682
Now let's move on
 to inner confidence.

19:02.682 --> 19:05.475
Say something
 you're embarrassed about,

19:05.475 --> 19:08.648
but say it with confidence!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.771
My grandma still makes me
sit in a car seat!

19:13.363 --> 19:15.775
A-ha! I got you now!

19:15.775 --> 19:17.657
Oh, shoot-- I mean...

19:17.657 --> 19:19.699
He-hey, Liam.

19:19.699 --> 19:23.453
Hey Bernie, what's--
Aww, what happened?

19:24.494 --> 19:27.667
My grandma still
 makes me sit in a car seat!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.629
(laughing)

19:29.629 --> 19:30.840
I know we're gonna
lose this office,

19:30.840 --> 19:32.792
but you should
totally post that.

19:35.755 --> 19:37.847
Hey, after you're
done surprising me,

19:37.847 --> 19:40.390
maybe you can help me
with my next dare:

19:40.390 --> 19:42.392
eating a sensible
amount of carrots.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.567
Oh, wow, the lounge!

19:48.728 --> 19:50.520
No, Dirk, look.

19:50.520 --> 19:55.615
The nitrogen launcher-trampoline
-basketball-hot-coals dare.

19:55.615 --> 19:57.737
You-- you set this up for me?

19:57.737 --> 19:59.909
But it's too dangerous.

19:59.909 --> 20:02.582
Yeah, but I adjusted
the physics of your dare

20:02.582 --> 20:04.824
so that instead of
a 99% chance of injury,

20:04.824 --> 20:08.418
now it's only 87%.

20:08.418 --> 20:09.499
Ahem.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.831
Well, Ms. Tyson
adjusted the physics.

20:11.831 --> 20:13.713
But she said I'm getting
extra credit for helping.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.595
I did not agree to that.

20:17.637 --> 20:20.470
It wasn't my place to tell you
what's best for your life.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.802
If you love doing dares,
I'm not gonna stop you.

20:22.802 --> 20:24.844
Thanks, Paige.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.481
I dedicate this next dare

20:31.481 --> 20:36.446
to the 13% chance I don't
break every bone in my body.

20:36.446 --> 20:37.487
Here we go!

20:37.487 --> 20:38.528
(cheering)

20:43.703 --> 20:44.824
You're a good person, Paige.

20:44.824 --> 20:46.576
Just tell me when it's over.

20:46.576 --> 20:49.539
-It's over.
-Nice try.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.870
Launch the hot coals!

20:55.835 --> 20:57.797
(gasping)

21:10.690 --> 21:12.812
(applause)

21:12.812 --> 21:14.734
Dare completed!

21:14.734 --> 21:16.656
(cheering)

21:21.991 --> 21:25.955
This is what I live for! Yeah!

21:25.955 --> 21:28.708
Thanks, everybody.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.710
But you should be
clapping for Paige.

21:30.710 --> 21:31.831
Aww.

21:31.831 --> 21:34.834
Because with the new physics
knowledge she introduced me to,

21:34.834 --> 21:38.508
now I can do even bigger
and more dangerous dares!

21:39.759 --> 21:41.631
Well, I tried.

21:41.631 --> 21:44.554
(applause)

21:44.554 --> 21:45.975
My turn!

21:49.639 --> 21:51.691
Kirk:
Wait, I don't know physics!

21:58.898 --> 22:00.740
(cheering)

22:03.703 --> 22:05.535
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

22:09.619 --> 22:12.662

I put a mini-fridge in here?

22:12.662 --> 22:15.755
Oh! That's a dead rat.

22:17.006 --> 22:19.719
He-hey!

Wow, this is a great office!

22:29.729 --> 22:32.932

Oh-ho, fancy.

22:34.894 --> 22:36.566
You're the guy we're meeting?

22:36.566 --> 22:38.818
Yeah.

22:39.899 --> 22:41.901
You said he was
the head of a TV network?

22:41.901 --> 22:45.825
Yup. Chief of
broadcast operations,

22:45.825 --> 22:47.987
Tarzana Community College.

22:47.987 --> 22:50.830

their basketball games,

22:50.830 --> 22:53.993
but I'm looking
to expand into comedy.
