WEBVTT

01:02.521 --> 01:04.397
We need to tell them the truth.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.220
-Dude, where have you been?
-Hey. I'm right here.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.723
Come on. Let's go. Ready? After you.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.350
Put my bag down.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.936
Okay, let's start from the top.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.688
So, for those of you who don't know me,

02:26.772 --> 02:28.524
I come from a background
of predictive modeling

02:28.607 --> 02:30.526
with an environmental focus.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.820
I started out as a post-grad
with the idea of predicting variation

02:33.904 --> 02:37.574
in bird migration patterns based
on climate change projections.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.910
What can I say, I like birds.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.663
Okay, pause here for polite laughter.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.706
No one's gonna laugh. I like birds.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.793
Just try not to look at your notes
so much and have fun.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.296
Previous methods
of doing that mostly relied

02:51.380 --> 02:54.216
on statistical correlative analysis
of tracking data.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.469
But the way I started out,
I was correlating bird movement

02:57.553 --> 03:00.347
using decision byte rules drawn
from statistical mechanics.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.766
And, yeah, it went from there.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.727
Pretty soon, I'd cooked up
a recursively self-improving predictive,

03:05.811 --> 03:08.814
non-obvious relationship matrix.
That's pretty dry.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.941
Yeah, but just remember, have fun.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.734
-This is fun.
-Okay.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.737
Then a couple of years back,
Pavani here stumbled across my work.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.531
-That's your turn. I get to sit down.
-Okay. Yes.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.867
Some super obscure research paper.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.036
Long story short-- And this is all my bit.
Yeah, okay.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.582
We seed investment,
offer Allie a spot on the incubator.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.834
Because at this point, it is very clear

03:28.917 --> 03:32.254
that the relationship matrix
has a number of real-world applications.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.547
That's you.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.757
For example, governments and NGOs

03:35.841 --> 03:38.802
are using satellite data
to predict the spread of H1N1,

03:39.386 --> 03:42.222
avian flu, cholera, malaria.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.058
And sure, they get decent results.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.935
They get workable results.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.731
But we, we get better results.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.402
By extrapolating data in a way
that hadn't been possible until now,

03:55.485 --> 03:59.489
we can micro-target populations vulnerable
to climate-based disruption.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.577
Because political instability,
climate change,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.914
economic unrest, famine, war,

04:08.207 --> 04:13.003
Pandemics, these things exist in

04:14.046 --> 04:15.923
-kind of a weather pattern--
-Okay, wait.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.675
We need to work
that middle section. It's not…

04:19.384 --> 04:20.385
Why?

04:20.469 --> 04:23.597
Because we're selling positives here,
not disasterbation.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.933
-That's a stupid word.
-I appreciate you very much too.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.937
But let's dial back on the famines
and pandemics,

04:30.020 --> 04:31.230
the whole end of days vibe.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.190
And, you know,
throw in a couple of pandas.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.358
Keep things upbeat.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.152
Hey, where you going?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.321
Let's just start again tomorrow.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.658
Dude, we're almost there.
Just one more rehearsal.

04:43.242 --> 04:47.287
Just think less Ebola and more dolphins,
couple of penguins.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.497
All right, more penguins.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.749
Come on, man, just-- It's super important.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.419
-I have to go talk to my wife.
-What? Is this good news?

04:54.503 --> 04:55.838
Are you guys back together?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.299
-It…
-Yeah.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.051
Look, do what you gotta do.
But let's just--

05:01.134 --> 05:02.553
let's pick up tomorrow, okay?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.222
-Bright and early, do not be late.
-Totally. I won't be late.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.515
Okay.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.184
Jesus Christ.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.443
Hey, how are you? Good to see you.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.738
Hey, it's good to see you too.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.282
So?

08:11.408 --> 08:15.120
So, yeah. Sorry, I'm here. Just--

08:15.204 --> 08:18.874
I've been noodling with this idea
that might help you guys out.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.252
Ice.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.298
You see that? Civilization, right?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.926
It's hot there. You're gonna need that.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.637
Do you know what's civilization?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.472
It's basic infrastructure,
sewage, water, lights.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.100
We need builders and engineers, Allie.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.188
You know I would love to, but I can't.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.398
Why not?

08:43.482 --> 08:44.983
I got responsibilities.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.985
To what?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.488
It's not what, it's them.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.240
And you know that.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
Except she doesn't want you, Allie.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.328
She's made that perfectly clear. But us?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.580
We could really use you down here.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.251
Well, the invitation's open.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.754
If you ever decide you wanna get away,

09:05.838 --> 09:09.007
you know you've got a place down here,
people who need you.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.804
-You're late.
-Didn't really sleep.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.431
But I'm sorry.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.225
Are you okay? You look a little…

10:00.934 --> 10:04.646
Yeah. Just-- I got this thing coming up.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.649
You know, they're making me jump
through hoops with the East Coast guys.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.735
That's what happens
when you sell your soul.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.113
To support our family,
so your parents didn't have to?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.450
No. It was about you,
validated by the money.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.784
Margot…

10:20.037 --> 10:21.413
It's not about the money.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.166
Daddy!

10:25.876 --> 10:27.794
There she is. Hi there.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.759
I got a silly monkey around my neck.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.845
How am I supposed to get you off?

10:36.929 --> 10:38.514
What did you do? What are you doing?

10:39.223 --> 10:41.266
-Should I unleash the tickle guns?
-No.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.476
No?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.938
-Where's your bag, honey?
-Up your butt.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.190
How'd a bag get up my butt?

10:48.899 --> 10:50.526
The cookie monster did it.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.819
-The cookie monster did it? What?
-Dina?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.571
Come get your things, sweetheart.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.656
Yes, Mom.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
Good girl. Come on.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.370
You want to take your teddy bear? Yeah?

11:30.899 --> 11:34.278
Dina, enough fooling around.
Let's go. Daddy's waiting, sweetie.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
No rush!

11:36.780 --> 11:39.074
Still trying to get a bag out of my butt.

11:41.243 --> 11:44.162
Okay. It's Daddy Day.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.457
-It's Daddy Day. All right.
-Sleepyhead. How are you? Hi.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.086
-Come on.
-Come, Dina.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.631
So, how long you been seeing this guy?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.134
-Who?
-Here, give me that.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.929
Richard. The North Dakota pipeline thing.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.140
What does it matter?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.101
He's having breakfast in our house.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.686
He's a colleague.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.567
Okay.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.944
Come on, let's walk to the car.

12:16.612 --> 12:20.532
Right now. Go, run! Come on!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.129
Wow.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.341
Come on,
you know he wasn't always like this.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.511
Of course he was. People don't change.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.514
They just reveal themselves over time.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.974
I don't want to talk about Allie, okay?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.144
All you need to know is he's not
gonna be a problem for us.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.314
And you don't get
to insult him in front of me.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.234
That's not something you get to do. Okay?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.404
Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:00.822 --> 13:01.865
Thank you.

13:19.258 --> 13:20.884
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.512
So, did you get it?

14:00.382 --> 14:03.844
10,000 years ago,
there were a million beings.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.430
200 years ago, there were a billion of us.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.851
Okay.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.020
Now, pour some of this in there.

14:18.692 --> 14:21.862
That the melting permafrost releases CO2

14:21.945 --> 14:26.241
and methane gas in such volumes
that a cascading tipping point…

14:40.714 --> 14:43.926
The root of the problem of environmental

14:44.009 --> 14:48.388
and animal annihilation
is human privilege.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.602
Don't even breathe.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.711
Come on, Allie.

15:21.255 --> 15:24.007
From the moment it began to crystallize,

15:24.091 --> 15:29.763
the American literary canon
was regarded as essentially pastoral.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.224
Preoccupied by...

15:33.308 --> 15:39.022
nature and rurality versus urban
and thus European and civilized.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.402
But Marinelli suggested
that "Arcadia" is, in fact,

15:43.485 --> 15:45.237
"the landscape of an idea.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.489
The middle country of the imagination."

15:47.573 --> 15:50.284
The-- "A place of becoming
rather than being."

15:50.993 --> 15:52.327
So however good this "good place,"

15:52.411 --> 15:54.496
it was actually a place
of better potential.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.083
I mean, there was a whole new world
to be subjugated and bound.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.920
And not least by
a coast-to-coast railroad network.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.630
So, as a result of which,

16:04.798 --> 16:07.801
the pioneer rather than the shepherd

16:07.885 --> 16:11.346
becomes the key figure in the specifically
American pastoral mode.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.348
Thanks so much.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.700
"Becoming rather than being."
That was pretty cool.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.285
Allie, I have an appointment.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.663
Wanna, maybe,
get a cup of coffee or something?

16:36.747 --> 16:40.876
Not really. Isn't it your day? Your pitch?

16:41.502 --> 16:45.047
In a little bit. I got time.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.803
So, listen, the reason I'm here is--

16:51.887 --> 16:53.138
Hey, can we just talk somewhere?

16:53.222 --> 16:55.349
I have an appointment, Allie, I told you.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.101
Appointment, sure.
It's just that-- Look, the main thing,

16:58.185 --> 17:00.896
the big thing is your guy Richard.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.398
He's not my guy, he's a guy.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.234
A guy who's hanging out with my kids.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.737
And if he's objecting to human
exceptionalism over the Cheerios,

17:08.819 --> 17:11.156
-I wanna know about it.
-What's this actually about?

17:13.242 --> 17:15.953
It's about-- Tell me this.
Tell me one thing.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.204
What's an English professor doing

17:17.287 --> 17:20.665
with a folder full of schematics
for some bio-tech lab?

17:22.584 --> 17:23.877
I just--

17:23.961 --> 17:26.296
-You left this thing lying there.
-Yeah.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.714
Meaning you had to take a look?

17:28.298 --> 17:31.677
Because it'd be a weird fucking thing
to respect someone's privacy, right?

17:32.678 --> 17:34.888
-It's my house.
-But it's my folder.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.892
Did he ask you to get that information
for him? Richard?

17:40.227 --> 17:41.895
I'm not having this conversation.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.482
Listen. Just hear me out, please.
Just for one second.

17:45.566 --> 17:50.404
Now, I know you miss it.
The way things were.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.407
The tree-spiking, the batons,
the pepper spray.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.785
-The craziness of it all.
-You think it was about craziness?

17:58.287 --> 18:00.581
Truthfully? A little bit, yeah. Sometimes.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.793
And sometimes, these days,

18:04.877 --> 18:08.505
I think you're just a little unhappy

18:09.131 --> 18:12.342
because things, you know, went wrong and…

18:13.802 --> 18:16.555
Which one of us are we actually
talking about here?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.895
Doesn't matter. Just back off.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.608
Good luck with your pitch.

18:39.328 --> 18:42.664
Dude! Pick up your phone.
Where have you been?

18:42.748 --> 18:44.291
I know. Look, I'm sorry. I was just--

18:44.374 --> 18:45.792
You look like shit.

18:46.919 --> 18:47.920
Yeah.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.004
What's wrong?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.589
I mean, honestly, Allie,

18:50.672 --> 18:52.841
it is such a thrilling space
for us to be in.

18:54.343 --> 18:57.721
Now, green initiatives and climate crisis
mitigation are 100% core

18:57.804 --> 18:59.806
to the company's vision going forward.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.685
But here's the thing,
I've been liaising with the OSM.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.395
It's the Office of Strategic Management.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.897
And it occurs to us, well,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.775
the software has any number
of marketplace applications.

19:09.858 --> 19:14.738
It could radically disrupt online
marketing or supply chain logistics.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.407
But in terms of homeland security,

19:18.200 --> 19:22.287
Allie, we could be looking at a form
of predictive intelligence gathering

19:22.371 --> 19:25.499
that is truly disruptive in the space.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.336
Right. But we're not really talking
about that, are we?

19:29.419 --> 19:32.548
Now,
technically it's not up for discussion.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.676
Your work is our property
to disburse as we see fit.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.137
But we're not looking
at an either-or here.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.931
More of a both-and kind of deal.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.268
See, government investment
in the project underwrites our investment,

19:44.351 --> 19:48.188
and so facilitates all the good
and important things that you want to do.

19:48.897 --> 19:52.568
So, I'm sorry, what are you asking?

19:52.651 --> 19:56.113
That you help trial the program
in partnership with our new client.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.199
And who is that exactly?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.995
The NSA? Are you fucking kidding me?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.622
Get over yourself.
No one's whoring anything to anyone.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.292
They're asking you
to trial a program for them.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.795
That's not that much to ask, is it?
You kiss one frog.

20:12.546 --> 20:16.175
It's more than a kiss.
And it's not on the fucking mouth.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.677
So? Who cares?
This is the real world, Allie.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.679
It's the cost of doing business.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.599
Sometimes you gotta shake
the hand that feeds you.

20:49.708 --> 20:53.504
Assuming that our species even make it
to 2030 without a third world war,

20:53.587 --> 20:55.797
I think that nature herself
might take control

20:55.881 --> 20:58.800
of the human catastrophe
by producing an even more--

21:13.774 --> 21:17.194
Well, the software has
any number of marketplace applications.

21:17.277 --> 21:21.156
It could radically disrupt online
marketing or supply chain logistics.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.158
But in terms of homeland security,

21:23.242 --> 21:26.912
we could be looking at a form
of predictive intelligence gathering

21:26.995 --> 21:29.581
that is truly disruptive in the space.

22:45.741 --> 22:48.619
Hey! Hey, we've got some kind
of incursion here.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.995
Somebody's in!

23:08.388 --> 23:09.765
Kill the session.

23:09.848 --> 23:13.894
Sir, that's the first thing I tried.
This user has some sort of rootkit access.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.854
Security assured us that couldn't happen.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.025
A rootkit like this, it's on design level.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.110
Sales and marketing guys
won't know it's there.

23:22.194 --> 23:24.655
All right. Let's get a team down there.

24:14.872 --> 24:17.124
We have a team on the way.
We're heading up now.

24:31.889 --> 24:32.890
They're gone.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.914
So that's the story? That's it.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.000
You hacked a database?

25:00.709 --> 25:03.587
Illegally accessed. Different thing.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.758
What was even on it?

25:09.092 --> 25:10.302
Metadata.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.180
Fucking metadata.

25:14.014 --> 25:17.351
That had been illegally gathered
on American citizens.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.648
Who gives a shit?

25:24.107 --> 25:27.027
Turns out, only the government.

25:27.778 --> 25:30.197
Not the people whose information
got hoovered up.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.366
Give me convenience
or give me death, right?

25:33.116 --> 25:35.702
You don't do this.
You don't run away and hide.

25:35.786 --> 25:39.248
You do what anyone does in America.
You hire a lawyer.

25:40.082 --> 25:45.003
Except we're talking about violating
the Espionage Act of 1917.

25:46.088 --> 25:47.923
Theft of government property, maybe.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.759
Willful retention
of national defense information.

25:51.343 --> 25:55.097
Best lawyer in the world?
I was facing 35 years.

25:55.681 --> 25:56.765
For looking.

25:56.849 --> 26:00.602
Yeah. At stuff they didn't want me to.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.358
Mom…

26:08.360 --> 26:11.697
And what, you just--
you dropped everything

26:11.780 --> 26:12.990
and went with him?

26:15.033 --> 26:16.034
Yeah.

26:16.118 --> 26:18.787
Mom, what about your career? Your life?

26:21.039 --> 26:22.082
Why?

26:26.628 --> 26:29.339
Because he's your dad and I love him.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.521
We got him.

26:58.535 --> 26:59.870
Thank you, guys.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.004
Hey, Allie.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.966
I'm Agent Raban. Agent Pinto.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.511
Sorry to have kept you waiting
for so long.

27:16.428 --> 27:19.014
You comfortable?
Get you anything? A cup of coffee?

27:19.097 --> 27:20.849
No. I'm good, thanks.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.559
Good. Good, good, good.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.855
So…
We're very interested to know what--

27:27.773 --> 27:30.943
what you were doing,
hacking into a secure government database.

27:31.527 --> 27:35.030
I wasn't hacking anything.
I was just accessing a database, you know.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.743
You guys are running a trial
using the software that I designed,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.537
so I got curious.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.915
-Took a peek.
-You took a peek.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.043
When you say you took a peek,

27:48.877 --> 27:52.923
you mean you exploited some sort of
undisclosed backdoor of your own design?

27:53.006 --> 27:56.635
Which looks less like tire-kicking
than malicious infiltration.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.679
With respect, that's bullshit.

28:01.098 --> 28:03.100
Just wanted to know
what you were doing with it.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.977
Why?

28:05.561 --> 28:07.771
-Because it's mine.
-Not by law.

28:10.232 --> 28:11.608
By rights.

28:13.694 --> 28:15.654
Hey, Allie, you know Orville Wright?

28:16.446 --> 28:18.657
-Guy that invented the airplane?
-Sure.

28:19.575 --> 28:22.202
It turns out that he
was around long enough

28:22.286 --> 28:26.874
to see newsreels of Enola Gay dropping
the bomb on Hiroshima.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.917
And how'd he feel about that?

28:29.001 --> 28:32.754
No one knows. And nobody gives a shit.

28:34.423 --> 28:38.760
Okay. Point taken.
Lesson learned. Can I go now?

28:39.928 --> 28:41.889
So, you and your wife…

28:43.140 --> 28:44.725
Margot, right?

28:45.726 --> 28:48.187
-Yes.
-You and she have a--

28:48.270 --> 28:51.398
a background in,
what do we call it, Agent Pinto?

28:51.481 --> 28:52.691
Direct action?

28:52.774 --> 28:53.984
Domestic terrorism.

28:55.194 --> 28:56.820
If that's what
you want to call a bunch of kids

28:56.904 --> 28:59.865
waving around a bunch of pickets
in front of Walmart, sure, yeah.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.368
-You okay?
-Yeah.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.495
You ready?

29:11.710 --> 29:12.878
No, no, no.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.172
I think you're doing yourself
a disservice there.

29:16.131 --> 29:18.884
Looks like Margot got herself
arrested a bunch of times.

29:20.302 --> 29:22.012
Back in her wild days, huh?

29:40.447 --> 29:43.575
Sabotaging logging operations,
tree-spiking,

29:43.659 --> 29:46.411
chaining herself to this... and that.

29:46.495 --> 29:49.248
A naked protest at an arms fair.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.209
She was pretty cool, right?

29:52.960 --> 29:54.545
See, I guess the thing of it is,

29:55.838 --> 30:01.343
we're interested in why you would
piggyback into a government server

30:01.426 --> 30:04.763
just to access information
on this one particular guy.

30:04.847 --> 30:07.182
Beaumont? Right?

30:07.266 --> 30:08.851
What do you want me to say, you know?

30:10.185 --> 30:11.562
The guy's sleeping with my wife,

30:11.645 --> 30:14.857
so I just, you know, figured maybe I could
dig up some dirt on him.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.944
We've all been there, I guess.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.321
Or somewhere like it.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.865
Did you find anything?

30:24.992 --> 30:26.159
Here's where we are.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.331
I'd like us to be friends on this thing.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.417
You're a clever guy.

30:34.168 --> 30:35.836
It's your baby, you made it.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.755
We'd like you to be a part of it.

30:40.215 --> 30:43.218
Now, what happened tonight?
Make no mistake, you broke the law.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.846
But the way I see it,
you were in a bad place

30:45.929 --> 30:48.724
and you got tempted to do what any man
would in your situation.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.853
A little peek inside Pandora's Box, huh?

30:53.645 --> 30:55.606
So I'm willing to let that slide.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.942
But this is a one-strike deal.

30:59.026 --> 31:01.528
You pull this kind of shit again,
we hang you out to dry.

31:01.612 --> 31:04.198
Rain down the kind of force majeure
that'll make your head start spinning

31:04.281 --> 31:06.408
like that little girl in The Exorcist.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.535
Government will prosecute,
you will go to jail,

31:08.619 --> 31:10.787
and you'll be seeing your kids
from behind glass.

31:10.871 --> 31:12.122
We clear on that?

31:13.999 --> 31:17.169
Hey. We clear on that?

31:18.045 --> 31:19.338
Sure.

31:25.302 --> 31:26.678
I guess you're free to go.

31:49.576 --> 31:51.662
Margot, it's me.

31:51.745 --> 31:54.623
Listen to me. Please listen to me.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.792
You gotta stop what you're doing.

31:56.875 --> 32:00.796
I'm coming to find you.
Just stop. Just wait.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.432
He's home.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.777
There are people still working.

32:24.444 --> 32:26.488
It's usually empty by 2:00 a.m.

32:29.157 --> 32:30.325
Let's go.

33:30.886 --> 33:32.054
-Hey!
-Hey, Brendan.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.263
-How are ya?
-I'm good.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.641
-Good. You wanna come in? I got--
-No.

33:35.724 --> 33:39.061
Say, how would you like to make
the quickest 500 bucks you've ever made?

34:00.290 --> 34:01.875
Okay, he's on the move.

34:02.668 --> 34:04.670
Stay with him. See what he's up to.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.385
Come on, come on, give me something.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.929
That's it, sir. We're locked out.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.515
Of what?

34:59.308 --> 35:01.894
Everything. The entire project.

35:02.728 --> 35:04.771
This guy completely salted the earth.

35:28.128 --> 35:29.421
-Good night.
-Night.

35:46.522 --> 35:47.523
Good night.

36:04.790 --> 36:07.334
Don't worry, they're all gone.
The place is empty.

37:01.638 --> 37:03.724
The genetic material is
in here somewhere.

37:09.354 --> 37:10.564
Then this is it.

37:44.515 --> 37:46.642
Genetic modification at work.

38:04.785 --> 38:05.786
Margot.

39:28.577 --> 39:32.247
Fuck, she works here. We have to go back.

39:32.331 --> 39:33.832
-We can't.
-Yeah, we can!

39:38.587 --> 39:40.005
-There isn't time.
-There is time.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.131
There isn't time!

39:43.425 --> 39:44.468
Fuck!

39:47.804 --> 39:49.056
There's nothing we can do.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.099
You fucking prick.

39:52.434 --> 39:53.852
Fuck you.

39:55.562 --> 39:56.563
Shit!

39:58.148 --> 39:59.983
Wait! Wait!

40:04.071 --> 40:05.822
Stop! Stop.

40:27.177 --> 40:28.512
Stop!

40:34.309 --> 40:35.394
Hey!

40:36.937 --> 40:38.480
Hey! Hey!

40:40.440 --> 40:42.401
Oh, God. Oh, God.

41:46.507 --> 41:49.176
Hey! There's a bomb.

41:51.094 --> 41:52.095
You gotta get out!

42:19.540 --> 42:20.832
How'd you find me?

42:20.916 --> 42:23.460
Margot, we have to get out of here, now.

42:25.838 --> 42:27.464
Margot, come on. Let's go.

42:28.382 --> 42:31.218
There's no point.
They're coming for me anyway.

42:32.344 --> 42:33.470
Me too.

42:35.722 --> 42:37.683
Allie, whatever you think you did tonight,

42:37.766 --> 42:39.393
you know you can walk it back.

42:39.935 --> 42:41.061
But this?

42:41.895 --> 42:43.772
There's no way to make it right.

42:45.065 --> 42:50.279
She left her phone. I tried to stop her.

42:52.823 --> 42:55.075
Look, there's nowhere for me to go.

42:55.158 --> 42:57.744
They'll be looking forever,
so you need to leave and take the kids.

43:00.914 --> 43:01.915
Please.

43:03.292 --> 43:06.503
The kids need us both.

44:09.733 --> 44:11.818
So, we're just going
to keep lying to them?

44:13.862 --> 44:15.322
Their whole lives?

44:15.405 --> 44:19.368
Well, just-- It seemed better for them
to keep blaming me than to blame you.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.411
What good's that going to do for anyone?

44:23.413 --> 44:26.542
Fine, then.
Go ahead, tell them. Wake them up.

44:26.625 --> 44:29.503
Tell them. I don't know
why you'd want to do that, but…

44:30.295 --> 44:31.505
Fine, tell them.

44:31.588 --> 44:34.466
Margot, it doesn't matter.

44:35.342 --> 44:36.760
None of it matters.

44:36.844 --> 44:39.596
Look, getting us this far,
it didn't go the way I'd hoped, but…

44:41.723 --> 44:45.811
I'm sorry. But that's behind us now,
and we've made it.

44:45.894 --> 44:47.855
Everything's gonna be different
from now on.

44:49.439 --> 44:50.899
Easy-breezy.

44:54.862 --> 44:58.699
People don't change, Allie.
They just reveal themselves over time.
