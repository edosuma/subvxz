Okay, I'm off.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.802
Well, we knew
this day would come.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.504
Good luck wherever
you wind up.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.139
Take care, buddy.
Call if you want.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.507
If not, take care
of yourself.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.176
I'm just going away
for a few days.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.978
Oh.
Oh, okay.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.980
Yeah, there's a seminar
on creating...

00:48.982 --> 00:50.915
Really? It would be that easy
for you?

00:50.917 --> 00:52.817
What?
You thought I was
leaving forever

00:52.819 --> 00:54.252
and you just said,
"Good luck"?

00:54.254 --> 00:55.153
What the hell
was that?

00:55.155 --> 00:57.188
Brian, take it easy.
You're not leaving forever.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.923
You're just leaving
for a few days.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.192
What do you want, a parade?
You know what?
Never mind.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.894
Look, Brian,
face it, you're a dog.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.430
The fact that your last name
is Griffin is a pleasantry

01:05.432 --> 01:08.299
extended from our family,
not by any legality.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.968
Yeah, and someday,
when you're ready,

01:09.970 --> 01:11.836
you're gonna walk off
into the woods and die.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.272
And we're prepared
for that.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.107
Yeah, so there's this seminar

01:16.109 --> 01:18.176
in New Haven on creating your
own Web-based Internet series.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.311
Sounds like it could be
right up my alley.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.846
Is this another one
of those classes

01:21.848 --> 01:24.983
where you make the checks out
directly to the teacher's name?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.451
Feel good about that?

01:26.453 --> 01:28.787
Feel good
about what you just said?

01:28.789 --> 01:29.721
You gonna go, Brian,

01:29.723 --> 01:31.723
or should I get
the can of pennies?

01:31.725 --> 01:35.060
(pennies rattle, Brian gasping)

01:39.832 --> 01:41.499
Guys, I got
some great news!

01:41.501 --> 01:43.034
My dad's coming
to visit.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.569
Oh-ho!
Hide the women!

01:44.571 --> 01:46.738
So, we're finally
gonna get to meet

01:46.740 --> 01:47.539
the man of
a thousand chicks.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.308
That's right. You think
I've been with a lot of broads.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.011
My dad's had more pie
than Kirstie Alley.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.512
(laughing) What?!

01:54.514 --> 01:56.147
Anyway, the navy
is honoring him

01:56.149 --> 01:57.215
at this year's
naval ball

01:57.217 --> 01:59.184
for all his bravery
in Vietnam.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.618
Wow, you must be proud.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.155
Sure am. He was like a hero
to me when I was growing up.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.256
You know who was my hero?

02:05.258 --> 02:08.960
Aquaman... and his secret
alter ego, Arthur Curry.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.563
Wow, you saved our lives,
Aquaman!

02:11.565 --> 02:13.832
Just doing my job.

02:15.334 --> 02:16.401
Arthur Curry!

02:16.403 --> 02:17.502
Did you see Aquaman?

02:17.504 --> 02:18.470
He was just here!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
Oh, darn,
I must've missed him.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.173
We forgot
to tell him thanks.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.810
Oh, I have a feeling
he already knows.

02:30.449 --> 02:32.083
(doorbell rings)

02:33.219 --> 02:34.853
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.222
Dad, they're here!

02:37.823 --> 02:38.289
At ease, ladies.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.326
Hey, Glenn, you're not gonna
give your dad an entrance?

02:41.328 --> 02:42.627
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I forgot.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.496
Guys, watch this.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.564
("These Boots Were Made
for Walking" plays)

02:46.566 --> 02:49.300
♪ Are you ready, boots?

02:50.202 --> 02:51.936
♪ Start walking!

02:59.044 --> 03:00.011
Ha! That's my dad!

03:00.013 --> 03:03.615
No one dances like Lieutenant
Commander Dan Quagmire.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.383
Dad, this is Joe and Peter.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.351
Joe and Peter!

03:06.353 --> 03:07.519
Which one are you?
Peter, sir.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.621
Look at you.
You're a chowhound,
aren't ya, Pete?

03:09.623 --> 03:12.190
Don't want to get behind you
in the mess hall, huh?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.925
No, sir.
No, you don't, sir.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.293
I'd stand and salute you, sir,

03:15.295 --> 03:17.896
but this is the best I can do.

03:18.497 --> 03:19.497
I'll take it.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.699
And a salutey-rooty-toot-tooty
back to you, my friend.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.234
Sir, you gotta tell
them about the time

03:23.236 --> 03:25.603
you had to eject
from your plane
behind enemy lines.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.473
And I will, but first,
it's been a long trip.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.208
This sailor needs a cosmo.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.109
A cosmo?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.978
Hey, it's got to be 5:00
somewhere, right? (laughs)

03:33.980 --> 03:35.113
(chuckles)

03:35.115 --> 03:37.382
Okay, fine.
I'll make you one;
you tell a story.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.516
He can be such
a nudge.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.852
So, anyhoo,
I remember that day
like it was yesterday.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.053
I'd gotten a haircut
earlier that day,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.923
the first one
I ever got over there
that looked like anything.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.624
So all of a sudden,
we get these orders.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.326
And, of course, it's
the day of all days

03:48.328 --> 03:49.527
I have to put on a helmet.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.197
I remember the sky was
a majestic orange.
(text alert tone)

03:52.199 --> 03:54.365
The breeze was just
warm enough that
you could wear

03:54.367 --> 03:56.134
short sleeves,
but you know, not so warm

03:56.136 --> 03:58.937
(text alert tone)
that you break any
kind of a sweat.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.572
because let me tell you,
I do hate to perspire.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.640
So anyway I just bit the bullet
and put on my helmet...

04:02.642 --> 04:05.176
Oh, sorry, that's
my auto spell correct.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.012
But, uh, yeah,
he's super gay.

04:12.117 --> 04:13.718
Brian, it's so boring here.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.186
When are you coming back?

04:15.188 --> 04:16.287
I'll be back soon, Stewie.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.256
And I gotta tell you, though,
this seminar is great.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.324
I'm really learning a lot.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.092
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.127
I'll talk to you later.
Wait, wait, hang on, Brian!

04:23.129 --> 04:26.130
There was, um, something else
I wanted to tell you.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.065
What?

04:27.067 --> 04:30.435
Um, the mail came a little later
than usual today.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.669
Yeah, Stewie, I gotta go.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.171
Ooh, wait, hang on, hang on!

04:33.173 --> 04:36.507
Did I tell you about...
that over there?

04:36.509 --> 04:38.843
Stewie, I can't physically see
what you're pointing at.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.578
I'm getting off now. Bye.
(phone beeps off)

04:40.580 --> 04:41.746
Well, your loss, Brian.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.115
That thing over there
is pretty interesting.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.952
Huh? An alien
in a grass skirt

04:47.954 --> 04:49.754
juggling torches.

04:49.756 --> 04:50.588
Yeah.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.957
All right, you're
all done. Go.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.493
Come on, Stewie.
Time for bed.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.228
Oh, get a job!

04:57.230 --> 04:58.396
Peter, what are
you doing home?

04:58.398 --> 05:00.398
I thought you'd be
out on the town

05:00.400 --> 05:01.432
with Quagmire
and his dad.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.301
Lois, you're not gonna
believe this.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.169
Quagmire's dad's gay.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.538
What? Quagmire never said
anything about that.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.740
I don't think he knows.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.308
It's like he doesn't
even notice it.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.510
Really? Well, then how
do you know he's gay?

05:12.512 --> 05:13.645
And a lot of
little things:

05:13.647 --> 05:15.079
the way he talks,
his mannerisms,

05:15.081 --> 05:17.916
and he had the complete
DVD set of <i>Sex and the City</i>

05:17.918 --> 05:20.318
between his butt cheeks.
Peter, no, he didn't!

05:20.320 --> 05:21.319
No. He had
the DVD set.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.688
I was just being colorful
with the rest of it.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.190
Well, maybe you should go
talk to Glenn about it.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.192
I mean, especially
if he has no idea.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.527
I guess I could,
but I don't know

05:29.529 --> 05:32.363
if it'll do any good, Lois;
he's in complete denial,

05:32.365 --> 05:33.698
like people
in massive debt.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.434
Well, honey,
I've extended
our line of credit

05:36.436 --> 05:38.236
and exhausted
all our savings.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.238
We should be good
for another month.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.172
Oh, that's great,
honey.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.373
What are we gonna do
next month?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.709
Well, I'll tell you
what we're not gonna do:

05:44.711 --> 05:46.844
shoot all of our children
and then kill ourselves.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.247
(both laugh)
I'm gonna hold you
to that.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.650
I don't think you'll have
any control over it.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.154
(doorbell rings)

05:56.722 --> 05:58.423
Hey, Peter,
how you doing?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.458
Hey, Quagmire.
Um, is your dad around?

06:00.460 --> 06:03.261
Oh, he's off at his
stitch n' bitch club.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.429
I'm glad you stopped by, though,

06:04.431 --> 06:06.531
My dad wanted me to tell you
he would be thrilled

06:06.533 --> 06:09.834
if you and Lois would join us
as his guests at the naval ball.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.269
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.372
Um... hey, remember when
we met him the other day,

06:14.374 --> 06:15.840
and he danced for a while?

06:15.842 --> 06:17.375
Oh, yeah, that was
so funny, man!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.410
No, it, it
wasn't funny.
Oh, my God.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.411
He's hilarious,
that guy.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.147
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny.
It was gay.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.849
(laughs)

06:24.851 --> 06:25.583
What?

06:25.585 --> 06:28.152
Yeah, I think
that your father is gay.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.554
Gay?! (laughs)

06:29.556 --> 06:30.755
We-we should
all be so gay!

06:30.757 --> 06:32.357
Quagmire,
don't you see it?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.492
See what?
I'll tell you
what I'm seeing.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.560
You're jealous!
Huh?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.229
Yeah, your father's a drunk,
and mine's a hero.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.263
Look, you'll see.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.266
At the navy ball, you'll see
how much of a man he is

06:42.268 --> 06:44.736
and how everyone in the military
respects him.

06:48.173 --> 06:51.476
(lively conversations,
music playing)

06:54.113 --> 06:55.246
Look at this, Dad.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.748
All of these people came out
just to honor you.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.751
Oh, it feels good, son;
I won't lie to you.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.618
Dan Quagmire!

07:00.620 --> 07:02.487
Wally!
Good to see you.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.421
This my son Glenn.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.589
Nice to meet
you, Glenn.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.724
You should be
very proud of
your dad.

07:06.726 --> 07:07.558
Oh, I am, sir.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.826
It was an honor
to serve with him.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.695
Come on, Dan,
let's get a drink.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.163
Huh. It's great
to see you

07:12.165 --> 07:13.765
back in your
element tonight;

07:13.767 --> 07:15.099
surrounded by seamen.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.200
(chuckles) "Seamen."

07:16.202 --> 07:17.869
See, Quagmire?
I told you he's gay.

07:17.871 --> 07:18.803
Shut up, Peter!

07:18.805 --> 07:20.638
Hey, you Dan's boy?
That's right.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.274
Your dad was very brave
back in Southeast Asia.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.375
He flew supplies in

07:24.377 --> 07:25.710
where others wouldn't
dare to go.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.378
I can't tell you
how many loads

07:27.380 --> 07:29.580
you dad took when
I served with him.
Huh?

07:29.582 --> 07:31.883
Glenn, I wouldn't miss
this night for the world.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.618
Everyone here
admires your dad.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.186
He'd walk into
an army barracks

07:35.188 --> 07:37.155
and make every private there
feel important.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.191
Yeah, he just knew how
to stroke those privates.

07:40.193 --> 07:40.825
Oh, God!

07:40.827 --> 07:42.326
Your dad was cock
of the walk, Glenn.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.829
Every day at rifle training,
he'd help me clean my butt.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.497
Your dad once drank
me under the table.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.734
If there was one man
you wanted in your hole,
it was your dad.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.936
Your dad had
the best penis
in the military.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.704
Okay, just stop, stop!

07:53.706 --> 07:55.540
Everybody stop!

07:56.108 --> 07:57.975
Dad...

07:57.977 --> 07:59.343
are you gay?

07:59.345 --> 08:00.411
What?

08:00.413 --> 08:01.646
Are you gay, Dad?!

08:01.648 --> 08:03.481
No, Glenn, I'm not gay.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.882
Just, just tell me the truth!

08:04.884 --> 08:05.983
I am telling you the truth.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.618
Now calm down.
You're ruining this ball.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.020
You know how much I love balls.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.822
All right, come on now!
That's not helping!

08:10.824 --> 08:15.259
Son, you have my word,
I am not gay.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.195
You promise?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.429
I promise.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.565
All right, I believe you.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.234
But I am a woman trapped
in a man's body.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.368
And while I'm in Quahog,

08:24.370 --> 08:27.738
I plan to have
a sex-change operation.

08:28.474 --> 08:31.175
Oh, come on.
Just be gay.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.912
(knocking)

08:34.914 --> 08:36.814
Hey, guys,
you got a minute?

08:36.816 --> 08:38.116
Hey,
what's up, buddy?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.384
It's, um,
it's about my dad.

08:40.386 --> 08:43.754
He... he wants to have
a sex-change operation

08:43.756 --> 08:45.323
Whoa! I knew he was gay.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.924
I didn't think
he was that gay.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.459
No, no, Peter,
he's not gay.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.461
He's a woman stuck
in a man's body.

08:50.463 --> 08:50.928
Yeah, gay.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.397
It's totally different!
Sounds the same.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.232
Well, it's not!

08:54.234 --> 08:55.766
Okay, so he wants
to be a woman

08:55.768 --> 08:57.001
so he can
be a lesbian?

08:57.003 --> 08:58.236
No, he'd date men.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.570
Gay.
Gay.
Yeah, gay.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.706
Okay, this is not
the help I came
over here for.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.942
Well, look, let's just all
agree that he's odd, huh?

09:04.944 --> 09:05.643
(laughs)

09:05.645 --> 09:07.445
He has an appointment Friday
with Dr. Hartman

09:07.447 --> 09:10.381
to have the procedure,
and he wants me to go with him.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.383
I-I just, I don't know
if I can handle that.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.952
Well, I'm sure your friend
Peter would be happy

09:14.954 --> 09:16.654
to come along
for moral support.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.256
All right, but look,
here's the deal:

09:18.258 --> 09:20.858
Anything he lops off,
we get to bring home for Brian.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.560
That's very green
of you, Peter.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.594
What?
I don't know.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.530
Lois, that doesn't make
any sense at all.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.831
Yeah, it's something
I heard on TV.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.634
I don't know.
Have fun at the circus.

09:33.438 --> 09:36.440
(sighs) I wonder how long
it's gonna take.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.508
I don't know.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.277
Hey, hey, you know
what we should do?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.778
We should put on
some '80s music,

09:40.780 --> 09:42.313
and then, like,
every few minutes,

09:42.315 --> 09:43.648
have him come
out of there

09:43.650 --> 09:45.783
as a different sex,
and we'll go...

09:45.785 --> 09:48.052
And then like the fifth
or sixth sex,

09:48.054 --> 09:49.687
we'll go like this...

09:49.689 --> 09:51.622
This is not a joke,
Peter, okay?!

09:51.624 --> 09:53.858
They're cutting off
his penis in there!

09:53.860 --> 09:54.725
All right, all right.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.361
I mean, this is my dad
we're talking about!

09:57.363 --> 09:58.629
Okay, okay.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.731
What are you
gonna name it, huh?

10:00.733 --> 10:01.966
What are you
gonna name

10:01.968 --> 10:03.568
your he/she
father/mother?

10:03.570 --> 10:04.569
Knock it off!

10:04.571 --> 10:08.372
Wow! That thing was on there.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.341
How is he, Doc?
Is he all right?

10:10.343 --> 10:12.076
No, I'm afraid not.
(gasps)

10:12.078 --> 10:15.580
But she's gonna be just fine!

10:21.787 --> 10:23.454
Oh, my God!

10:23.456 --> 10:25.923
(feminine voice):
What do you think, boys!

10:26.091 --> 10:30.928
♪ I'm walking on
sunshine, whoa-oa! ♪

10:34.766 --> 10:38.603
Okay, kids, Mr. Quagmire
and his da-- h-his mo--

10:38.605 --> 10:40.771
his friend are coming
over soon for dinner.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.740
So, remember, Chris,
no staring.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.642
And, Meg, you know
how it is

10:44.644 --> 10:46.677
to be different,
so be very nice.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.446
(doorbell rings)

10:49.748 --> 10:50.648
Well, hi, you guys.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.684
I'm so glad you
could come over.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.621
Everyone, I'd like you
to meet Ida.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.955
Hello,
everyone.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.624
Hello, Ida.
What's up?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.058
I made a crumble.

11:01.060 --> 11:01.892
Oh, how thoughtful.

11:01.894 --> 11:06.464
Throw it away
in the outside garbage.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.636
Okay, you know what?
Elephant in the room.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.038
I'll say it. So, Ida,
you miss your penis?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.840
Peter!
Thank you for asking it.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.809
Geez.
No, it's okay, it's
a perfectly normal question.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.812
We can't sit here and just
pretend everything's the same.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.081
It is a big transition
for me, yes.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.883
But the answer is,
I still have it.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.753
They just turn it inside out
to simulate a vagina.

11:28.755 --> 11:29.587
Come on, Dad...

11:29.589 --> 11:31.656
Not a bad option
to have in the back pocket.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.991
So, Lois, w-what
is this meal?

11:33.993 --> 11:35.760
Wow... so good.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.961
Oh, thank you, Glenn.

11:36.963 --> 11:37.995
It's nothing fancy.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.463
Just chicken
with rosemary.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.999
But I did put a lot of
planning into the meal.

11:42.001 --> 11:42.967
Yeah, we went down the list.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.835
Nothing with wieners,
nuts, or grapes.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.703
Out of respect.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.172
Lois, I have to say,
you look so put together.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.874
Where do you buy
your clothes?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.342
Oh, how sweet.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.777
Well, I love Anne Klein.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.978
Oh, I'll have
to try them.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.579
I like the outfit
you have on.

11:55.581 --> 11:56.947
Thank you, Meg.
Who did your procedure?

11:56.949 --> 12:00.985
Wow, you just burned your
last friend in this room, lady.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.453
This corn is special.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.921
So tell me about
those knockers.

12:03.923 --> 12:04.855
Are we-- are tho--

12:04.857 --> 12:06.590
is that just like,
r-- implants

12:06.592 --> 12:09.093
or did they reassign
some ass fat up there?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.462
All right, I'm out of here.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.029
(door slams)

12:12.031 --> 12:14.832
I wonder if I could
push mine inside.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.601
Oh, my God, it worked.
It's gone.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.804
I can't believe--
oh, no, it's back.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.979
Well, that was quite
a performance.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.449
My performance?
What about you?

12:31.451 --> 12:32.917
"Golly, Lois,
where do you shop?

12:32.919 --> 12:33.951
"Gee, your house
looks beautiful.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.219
Hey, I have
an inside-out penis."

12:35.221 --> 12:37.021
I never said their
house looks beautiful.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.155
Because, frankly,
it didn't.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.659
My dad, <i>my dad,</i>
<i>talking about decorating</i>

12:41.661 --> 12:42.760
and women's clothing?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.663
All I've talked about for years
with these people

12:45.665 --> 12:47.565
is what a war hero you were.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.232
And I was.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.267
I'm changing my future,
not my past.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.137
Oh, yeah?
What about my future, huh?

12:53.139 --> 12:55.172
I don't even know
what to call you.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.674
My dad? My other mother?

12:56.676 --> 13:00.077
My friend who pees sitting down
but can also palm a basketball?

13:00.079 --> 13:02.113
What about Ida?
Oh, no.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.482
Man, you know,
this is too hard.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.917
You know, you're asking me
to accept an awful lot.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.254
I... I... I don't know
if I can do this.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.455
I understand.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.091
I had the advantage of thinking
about this for years.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.794
For me it was easy:
do I want to be happy

13:16.796 --> 13:18.062
the rest of my life
or miserable?

13:18.064 --> 13:21.065
So now you're happy
and I'm miserable.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.902
I see.
I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:33.211 --> 13:34.879
Oh, boy, nice
to be back home.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.248
Those seminars
can wear you out.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.517
(clears throat)

13:39.519 --> 13:41.819
Wow, did you say
"Web-based Internet series"?

13:41.821 --> 13:44.989
No.
Oh, my bad.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.957
Great... idea...
for one.

13:46.959 --> 13:47.892
Where am I taking
you again?

13:47.894 --> 13:50.194
You know what?
Drop me off at the Marriott.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.129
I could use a drink.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.068
Jack on the
rocks, please.

13:58.904 --> 14:03.841
Hey, here's to exciting new
opportunities on the Internet.

14:06.144 --> 14:08.145
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to bother you.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.280
Oh, no, it's not you.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.882
I-I'm just dealing
with a lot right now.

14:11.884 --> 14:12.783
You know, kids.

14:12.785 --> 14:16.687
Ah. Does not... come...
with a manual.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.321
(chuckles)

14:17.323 --> 14:20.858
So, wha-- you're doing
something with the Internet?
I am, I am.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.427
Being a writer, I'm always
exploring new possibilities.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.930
Wow, I could
never be a writer.
How do you do it?

14:25.932 --> 14:28.065
Well, you see,
when I watch the world go by,

14:28.067 --> 14:30.301
I think of it kind of
like a huge screen.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.770
You know, every little
interaction, every little moment

14:32.772 --> 14:36.040
is another scene captured
by this camera.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.975
That's fascinating.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.043
Oh, yeah.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.479
Brian.
Ida.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.948
Two more, please.

14:43.950 --> 14:44.682
So I finally tell them,

14:44.684 --> 14:48.886
"Hey, I came here to be
at the seminar, not run it."

14:48.888 --> 14:51.155
(both laughing)

14:52.057 --> 14:54.091
That's... oh.
(chuckles)

14:54.093 --> 14:55.659
Hmm.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.034
You know,
we are in a hotel.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.604
And I'm in room 406.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.473
Go on ahead,
I'll settle up.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.378
Put it on 406.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.284
Well, look who's home.
Hey, buddy.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.318
How was the seminar?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.654
Oh, it was terrific.
The first day we were there...

15:23.656 --> 15:26.957
Brian, Brian, Brian.
I was after good or bad.

15:26.959 --> 15:27.691
You know what?
Fine.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.760
Y-You guys are not gonna
get to me this morning.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.694
I am in too good a mood.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.998
I met an amazing woman;
finally, the whole package.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.266
Oh, you met her
at the seminar?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.302
No, that's just it-- it was
right here in town last night.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.038
She's a classy,
smart, beautiful lady.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.074
Look, I took a
picture of her.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.576
See.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.648
Uh...

15:51.650 --> 15:54.385
Wha... i-i-is...?

15:54.387 --> 15:55.819
Um...

15:55.821 --> 15:56.921
Uh...

15:56.923 --> 15:58.989
Here, Lois, take a look.

15:58.991 --> 16:02.726
(both laughing uncontrollably)

16:03.595 --> 16:04.862
Oh, my God!

16:04.864 --> 16:07.965
This is the best
day of my life!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.099
(laughing)

16:09.101 --> 16:10.834
You know what?
You're just jealous

16:10.836 --> 16:12.703
'cause I found a real woman.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.006
(laughing harder)

16:18.176 --> 16:19.977
Oh, hey, Brian.
Hey.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.245
Not to worry,
I called in,

16:21.247 --> 16:24.415
and a new cell phone
should be here for you
in three business days.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.350
What? Why?
Well, clearly,
yours is broken.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.885
Because I haven't
heard from you.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.453
I wanted to tell
you about my week.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.188
God... doesn't anyone
in this house

16:31.190 --> 16:32.923
care about anyone
but themselves?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.625
Hey, Brian,
how was the seminar?

16:34.627 --> 16:35.626
Meg, please.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.760
I'm serious, Stewie.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.430
I have had an amazing
few days and nobody cares.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.398
Oh, come on in.
Come on in.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.499
Tell old Stew.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.235
Okay, well, first, the
seminar was terrific.

16:45.237 --> 16:46.437
I absorbed so much.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.372
And then I get back here
last night,

16:48.374 --> 16:49.807
and I meet an incredible woman.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.343
You know, I've heard the phrase
soul mate for years,

16:52.345 --> 16:53.777
and I never got it
till last night.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.982
Well, I've got a woman
story for you that you're
not gonna believe.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.718
Quagmire's father,
decorated war hero,

17:00.720 --> 17:05.255
Lieutenant Commander
Dan Quagmire, is now a woman.

17:05.257 --> 17:06.357
You're kidding.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.058
No. Total sex change.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.461
(laughs)
That is hysterical.
I know, huh?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.895
Suck on that, Quagmire.

17:11.897 --> 17:15.833
Yeah, it's, it's not settling
with the Q-man all too well.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.068
Oh, my God, what--
wha-what does it look like?

17:18.070 --> 17:18.969
You know, not half bad.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.704
Nothing you'd look
twice at, but not bad.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.273
Oh, my God, that-- you know,
that is a tough road ahead.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.042
I mean, like,
what do those people do

17:25.044 --> 17:28.045
as far as relationships
and sex and stuff?

17:28.047 --> 17:28.646
I don't know.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.482
I mean, it's got to be
a train wreck down there, right?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.517
I mean, just-just an absolute
casserole of nonsense.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.953
Is she over there right now?
We should go take a look.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.988
No. They had a fight;
she's staying at the Marriott.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.189
Aw, damn, I was just there.
Really?

17:39.191 --> 17:42.359
Yeah, maybe I saw him in the
lobby and didn't even know.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.028
Oh, no, you'd know.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.796
Aw, man, what-what
do we call him now?

17:45.798 --> 17:46.997
We-- do we still
call him Dan?

17:46.999 --> 17:49.066
No, and I'm not crazy
about the name change.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.568
What is it...
like Danielle or Dana?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.003
No, Ida.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.973
(retching)

18:00.412 --> 18:03.781
(retching)

18:34.379 --> 18:37.314
(gasping)

18:37.316 --> 18:38.115
(screaming)

18:38.117 --> 18:41.051
Oh, what?! What the hell?!
What's wrong with you?!

18:41.053 --> 18:42.553
I had sex with her!
What?!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.955
I had sex with her
at the Marriott!

18:44.957 --> 18:45.689
Aah, why?!

18:45.691 --> 18:47.825
I didn't know!
I didn't know it was her!

18:47.827 --> 18:50.894
Oh, my God!
(both screaming)

18:50.896 --> 18:53.130
How does this happen?!
When they move to a new place,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.265
they're supposed to notify
the neighborhood!

18:55.267 --> 18:55.933
That's how it works!

18:55.935 --> 18:58.936
He didn't actually move,
he's just visiting!

19:08.346 --> 19:10.647
Oh, Dad, I've been worried sick.
Where have you been?

19:10.649 --> 19:15.886
Listen, I... I feel awful about
the things I said last night.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.421
I was selfish.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.956
Aw, you weren't selfish.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.225
I realize I put
a lot on you.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.292
I was wrong
to just assume

19:22.294 --> 19:24.828
that you would understand
and be able to accept this.

19:24.830 --> 19:29.900
But, trust me, I had been
unhappy for a long, long time.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.368
Wow.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.004
Well, all I want is
for you to be happy.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.205
You're my dad.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.108
And if you're happy,
I'm happy for you.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.910
I'm sorry, Dad.

19:39.912 --> 19:40.878
I love you.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.213
I love you, too, Glenn.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.850
Glenn?
Sorry, sorry.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.919
Damn thing can't
tell the difference.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.988
(both laughing)

19:50.990 --> 19:51.889
Oh, dear...

19:51.891 --> 19:55.459
Okay, well, so now that we got
all the mush out of the way,

19:55.461 --> 19:56.960
I have some news.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.095
Tell me. Tell me.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.463
I met someone.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.330
What? You did?

20:00.332 --> 20:02.065
Oh, my God, Glenn,
he's amazing.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.333
I couldn't be happier.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.035
Really? What's his name?

20:05.603 --> 20:08.605
QUAGMIRE (screaming):
No!

20:08.607 --> 20:11.108
(shuddering)

20:16.981 --> 20:19.883
(shuddering continues)

20:22.487 --> 20:23.520
(door slams)

20:23.522 --> 20:24.988
QUAGMIRE:
Where is he?!

20:24.990 --> 20:28.392
Where is that self-centered,
arrogant son of a bitch?!

20:30.528 --> 20:32.963
Get out of there,
you dirty little bastard!

20:32.965 --> 20:34.464
You're dead!

20:34.466 --> 20:37.868
(both grunting)

20:41.239 --> 20:43.273
(groans)

20:45.410 --> 20:48.612
(both grunting)

20:48.614 --> 20:50.314
(groaning)

20:53.918 --> 20:56.119
If I ever see you
anywhere near my house,

20:56.121 --> 20:58.055
I'll blow your head off!

20:58.523 --> 21:01.558
Now lay there and die,
you piece of crap!

21:04.629 --> 21:06.430
(panting):
Hey.

21:08.299 --> 21:10.567
I (bleep) your dad.
