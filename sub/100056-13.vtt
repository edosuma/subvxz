WEBVTT

00:08.965 --> 00:10.923
So then the von Trapp family
makes it out of the theater

00:10.967 --> 00:13.709
and crosses the Alps
together to freedom.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.494
That's what The Sound of Music
is about?

00:16.538 --> 00:17.843
DANIEL:
That's crazy.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.280
The main girl is
in love with a Nazi,

00:19.323 --> 00:21.064
and you're supposed
to root for her?

00:21.108 --> 00:24.937
No, no, no. The main character
is Maria, the nun.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.069
I don't get it.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.332
This is why no one likes
your generation.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.597
I'm not staying there
if there's a gas leak.

00:32.641 --> 00:36.297
What do you mean, it might
help me sleep? Just fix it.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.081
Ugh, I hate my landlord.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.040
Do you hate
hairbrushes, too?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.258
CALEB:
Yeah.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.086
You look like a bird
flew into your hair.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.045
No shade. That's how
I ended up with this cut.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.091
I had to flee my apartment.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.267
I didn't have time
to grab my hairbrush.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.487
Now I have to find
another place to stay tonight.

00:52.530 --> 00:56.491
Maybe I'll find an Airbnb,
or call me crazy, a regular B&B?

00:56.534 --> 00:59.972
A B&B? Don't stay at some
weird old person's house.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.061
Stay with me.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.847
You'll have a bed, breakfast,

01:04.890 --> 01:08.111
and nonstop access to
fresh fruit and friendship.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.504
Really? That would be amazing.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.158
You can sleep
in Jenny's old room.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.116
I promised her
I wouldn't read her diaries.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.118
But you didn't.Mm.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.512
If I find out how old she was
when she lost her virginity,

01:17.555 --> 01:19.209
should I tell you?

01:19.253 --> 01:22.212
[scoffs] Lexie, she already
told me. She was 26.

01:25.128 --> 01:28.218
â™ª

01:28.262 --> 01:29.263
[beep]

01:34.268 --> 01:35.791
Having you stay over
will be so fun.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.445
I used to love
slumber parties as a kid.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.621
Oh, I was great at sleepovers.
I always stayed up the latest

01:39.664 --> 01:42.319
and put everyone's
undies in the freezer.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.626
Uh-oh.
It's the party people.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.455
You have permission
to stay in my room,

01:47.498 --> 01:50.458
and you also have permission
to read my diaries.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.852
Aw, you guys give
the same permissions.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.854
I wish I could join,
first for the fun,

01:55.898 --> 01:58.422
and second, I have to borrow
all your pots and pans again.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.250
What happened
to your birthday pans?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.686
I took them back to the store

02:01.730 --> 02:03.166
and turned them into
birthday earrings.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.428
Have fun tonight, you guys.

02:05.473 --> 02:08.563
You know, it's rude
to talk about an event

02:08.606 --> 02:11.261
in front of someone
who hasn't been invited.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.046
Oh, Dennis, are you jealous?

02:14.090 --> 02:15.396
Course not.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.354
But I swear to God,
if you choreograph

02:17.398 --> 02:19.922
any dances without me,
there will be hell to pay.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.534
This patient was admitted
with cardiogenic shock.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.884
We need to take his blood
pressure in real time.

02:25.928 --> 02:29.540
He's sedated, so we can insert
the a-line. Observe.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.543
Ah, yes.

02:32.587 --> 02:36.591
The iPhone generation loves
using the ultrasound

02:36.634 --> 02:38.593
to detect an artery.
[grunts]

02:41.248 --> 02:43.250
Nothing's coming up.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.514
Well,

02:46.557 --> 02:49.212
looks like it's broken again.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.474
I think you just need to...It's broken.

02:52.476 --> 02:56.437
I think you just
need to turn it on.I'll handle this.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.569
No ultrasound? But how are
you gonna find the artery?

02:58.613 --> 02:59.788
What if you miss?

02:59.831 --> 03:01.398
Good thing I don't miss.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
That's incredible.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.097
He just inserted
an a-line blind.

03:05.141 --> 03:08.405
That's like putting in contacts
with a foam finger.

03:10.407 --> 03:11.582
The patient is stable.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.367
Let's move.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.717
Technology has
become a crutch.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.503
New doctors are not learning the
clinical skills which have been

03:19.547 --> 03:22.289
the foundation of medicine
for hundreds of years.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.900
So I propose, for
the next few days,

03:24.943 --> 03:27.250
we stay away
from technology

03:27.294 --> 03:28.947
and we practice
the fundamentals.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.906
Whoa. We're going acoustic.

03:30.949 --> 03:34.257
Dr. Frost Unplugged.
[chuckles]

03:34.301 --> 03:37.391
Excellent repartee, Dr. Sommers.

03:37.434 --> 03:38.957
Great idea, Dr. Frost.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.003
Teach these newbies
a thing or two.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.570
Well, I think
you could benefit

03:42.613 --> 03:44.485
from the back-to-basics
experience as well, Dr. Jacobs.

03:44.528 --> 03:47.270
[laughs]

03:47.314 --> 03:50.621
I can assure you, my skills
are more than sufficient.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.667
Well, I am excited to see them.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.755
Oh.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.412
Hey! Dr. Jacobs,

03:58.455 --> 04:00.457
you're one of us.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.286
I will never be one of you.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.638
Carol, I love your place.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.467
Not as many tchotchkes
as I expected.Mm-hmm.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.295
But about the right
amount of throw pillows.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.905
Yeah.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.821
Well, after my ex-husband
moved out, I redecorated a bit.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.606
Give me a handful
of throw pillows,

04:18.649 --> 04:20.956
and I'll give you a home.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.828
You really did win Teacher
of the Year every year.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.527
2001, 2002, 2004-- wait.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.616
Where's 2003?[sighs]

04:28.659 --> 04:30.792
It's in there.

04:33.882 --> 04:36.319
"Teacher of the Year
First Runner-Up 2003"?

04:36.363 --> 04:39.148
Yeah.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.672
Yeah, another teacher
saved the principal

04:41.716 --> 04:44.762
from choking on a tater tot.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.550
It's all politics.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.296
So, what should
we do first?

04:56.339 --> 04:58.341
Binge a TV show,
paint our nails--

04:58.385 --> 05:00.387
Oh, we could prank-call Caleb.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.693
Ooh. I was planning
on taking a shower,

05:02.737 --> 05:04.956
but I haven't prank-called
someone since junior high.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.784
But we would need a landline.

05:06.828 --> 05:10.440
Oh, you mean, like this?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.705
Tell me it has
a super long cord.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.620
Oh, yeah.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.623
The longest. I canceled
my cable from the toilet.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.543
Carol with her hair down?

05:26.587 --> 05:27.979
Mm.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.504
I feel like I'm seeing
James Bond in flip-flops.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.722
[chuckles]

05:31.766 --> 05:33.289
[knock on door]Oh, did you order food?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.073
No, it's probably Jerry.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.336
Who?

05:36.379 --> 05:37.728
Hey, there, Jer.

05:37.772 --> 05:38.599
Hello.Come on in.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.774
Meet my friend Lexie.Oh.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.297
Hey, Lexie. Nice to meet you.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.994
Hey, Carol, I picked these
from my tree.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.605
I wanted to bring them by
because I know

05:44.648 --> 05:45.867
how much you like
making lemon bars.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.348
Oh. You are the sweetest, Jerry.

05:48.391 --> 05:51.699
[chuckles]Wow, you sure are.

05:52.917 --> 05:56.225
Carol, where have you
been hiding this one?

05:56.268 --> 05:58.793
Next door for the past 20 years.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.273
[laughter]

06:01.317 --> 06:03.058
You are so funny, Carol.

06:03.101 --> 06:06.540
Hey, uh, while I was up on my
ladder picking these bad boys,

06:06.583 --> 06:08.411
I noticed your gutters
were a little clogged.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.413
I can clean them out for you
tomorrow if you like.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.936
I will pay you in lemon bars.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.198
Deal! [chuckles]

06:13.242 --> 06:14.939
I'll give you change in smiles.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.769
All right. See you later, Carol.
Always a pleasure.Okay.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.032
Hey, nice meeting you, Lexie.Hmm.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.388
Well, well, well.

06:28.431 --> 06:31.782
Hair-down Carol
has a gentleman admirer.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.132
What are you talking about?

06:34.176 --> 06:37.919
Uh, old Jerry? He wants to get
in your gutters, girl.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.269
He's just a good neighbor.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.053
Carol, you're still wearing
your marriage glasses.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.142
What?
What do you mean by that?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.666
Uh, how long
were you married?

06:45.709 --> 06:47.842
22 years.So for 22 years,

06:47.885 --> 06:50.148
you were completely blind to
anyone showing interest in you.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.499
Because what was the point?
You were practically dead.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.285
But I'm not married anymore,

06:56.328 --> 06:58.592
so how can I be
wearing marriage glasses?

06:58.635 --> 07:01.464
Carol, it takes time to
break that long of a habit.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.249
Jer is throwing love
beams in your direction,

07:04.293 --> 07:06.861
and your marriage glasses
are blocking out the rays.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.864
I can't see them
because they're not there.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.694
All I'm saying is
I'm not exchanging night lemons

07:13.737 --> 07:15.913
with my neighbors.

07:15.957 --> 07:19.874
Jerry is a nice friend,
end of story.

07:19.917 --> 07:23.791
No. Jerry is in love
with you, end of story.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.142
Now, let's call Caleb

07:27.185 --> 07:29.449
and pretend we're Jane Goodall
and ask for money.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.844
Dr. Sommers,
nice job identifying

07:33.888 --> 07:36.934
that positive egophony
in a patient's lungs.

07:36.978 --> 07:40.024
And don't worry, you two.
You'll get better with practice.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.812
A significant
amount of practice.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.945
Yeah, you guys.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.165
When someone's lungs are clear,
and they say "A,"

07:50.208 --> 07:51.906
it sounds like, "Eh."

07:51.949 --> 07:53.690
But when they have pneumonia,
it sounds like, "Ee."

07:53.734 --> 07:55.866
Do you hear the difference?
"Eh, ee..."

07:55.910 --> 07:58.347
BOTH [chanting]:
"Eh, ee,

07:58.390 --> 08:00.088
"eh, ee,

08:00.131 --> 08:02.307
eh, ee, eh..."

08:02.351 --> 08:04.571
We got it!
Excellent.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.876
Ooh.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.705
Our next patient has
dilated cardiomyopathy.

08:08.749 --> 08:12.013
Who wants to learn a
cardiac percussion test?

08:12.056 --> 08:13.884
It's a conga beat.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.930
[vocalizing conga music]

08:17.453 --> 08:18.672
CALEB:
Ooh.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.064
Muy caliente.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.763
Let's go.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.026
This is ridiculous.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.810
We've seen two
patients in the time

08:26.854 --> 08:28.203
it usually takes
us to see ten.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
You know how I know
this is pointless?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.860
Because Caleb is good at it.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.645
We are paying the price
for Dr. Frost's technophobia.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.865
Guys, this chest
isn't gonna tap itself.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.170
Let's move.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.914
[chuckles]:
Oh, this has to stop.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.744
Thanks for letting me stay
with you, but don't worry,

08:47.788 --> 08:51.400
I'm going home tonight so you
and Jerry can finally smash.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.577
You know, I don't usually
say things like this

08:54.621 --> 08:56.710
to people who I care about,
but zip it.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.886
Why are you telling
Lexie to zip it?

08:58.929 --> 09:00.148
LEXIE:
I was talking about

09:00.191 --> 09:01.366
Carol's boyfriend.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.586
Mm. How is Jerry?Jenny.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.502
I knew it!Oh, is he still bringing
her love lemons?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.592
Carol's got a man-friend?
Oh, tell me everything.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.160
No. He's not
my man-friend.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.858
He's a man who
is my friend.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.557
You know, men can be nice to
women they don't want to date.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.517
[laughter]

09:21.561 --> 09:23.519
Rarely.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.652
But if they like you,
they'll do anything.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.872
I've, uh, never had to
hire a mover in my life.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.832
You know, this seems like a
very outdated point of view,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.094
and that's coming from me.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.748
You've seen my landline.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.054
All right, allow
me to demonstrate.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.491
Hey, uh, can you
grab me some ketchup?

09:39.535 --> 09:41.624
You have legs. I'm busy.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.368
Now, observe this.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.500
Hey, Jake.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.067
Hey, Lexie, what's up?

09:50.111 --> 09:52.156
I need to get my tires rotated,
but I don't feel like it.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.897
Can you drive it to the garage

09:53.941 --> 09:55.595
and have them do it
and then bring it back here?

09:55.638 --> 09:56.726
Yeah, sure, of course.
When? Now?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.249
I could take a sick day.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.731
You know what? Never mind.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.037
Just grab me some ketchup.

10:05.822 --> 10:09.173
Oh, my gosh.
I think you guys might be right.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.306
Have I been wearing
marriage glasses?

10:11.349 --> 10:13.656
Does Jerry really have
feelings for me?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.789
DENNIS/LEXIE/JENNY:
Yes!

10:15.832 --> 10:17.834
Carol, are you gonna
get with Jerry?

10:17.878 --> 10:19.314
Oh, gosh, no.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.751
No, no. Jerry is not my type.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.840
He's too gentle.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.321
You know,
I like a man with an edge,

10:26.364 --> 10:29.063
like Harry Connick Jr.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.240
Ooh, Carol.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.808
Girl, you a freak.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.028
[gasps]

10:38.072 --> 10:39.856
[quietly]:
Oh, my God.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.468
Where do you want to live?

10:43.512 --> 10:44.818
Yes.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.475
Enjoy your new friends.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.912
[knock on door]

10:51.955 --> 10:53.435
[clears throat]

10:56.264 --> 10:57.744
Hey, Jerry.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.136
Thanks for coming.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.268
What's this?

11:00.311 --> 11:01.922
Lemon bars.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.793
I realized today, what with
your busy doctor schedule,

11:03.837 --> 11:05.839
you might not have time
to make them yourself,

11:05.882 --> 11:07.144
so I whipped you up a batch.

11:07.188 --> 11:10.321
Oh, sweet, gentle Jerry.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.932
Come on in.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.978
Now, they are a little
unconventional.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.938
I added just a hint of freshly
grated nutmeg for some spice.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.941
[sighs] Jerry,

11:20.984 --> 11:22.507
we need to talk.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.074
Is it the gutters?

11:24.118 --> 11:25.946
You know, there was a crow
up there giving me the business,

11:25.989 --> 11:28.513
so I didn't clean them out
quite as thoroughly as I wanted.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.733
No. It's not that.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.039
[sighs]

11:33.344 --> 11:34.998
Jerry,

11:35.042 --> 11:38.741
you are such a nice guy
and a great neighbor.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.396
This is hard to say.

11:41.439 --> 11:45.748
But... I can tell you
have feelings for me...

11:45.792 --> 11:47.358
Nope, nope. No, I do not.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.753
What?I-I...

11:50.797 --> 11:52.624
I am sorry for any
misunderstanding.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.714
I mean, you are
a-a nifty gal

11:54.757 --> 11:56.019
and-and a nice neighbor,
but, yeah,

11:56.063 --> 11:57.499
that is, [smacks lips]
that's it.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.850
But... you're always
bringing me lemons.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.765
The constant lemons.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.159
My tree makes too many;
if I don't get rid of them,

12:05.202 --> 12:06.856
I wind up with
a real squirrel problem.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.858
But all the chores.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.078
I just wanted to lend a hand.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.254
I mean, ever since your divorce,
you've been all alone.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.125
I guess, I just
felt sorry for you.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.172
I-- Oh, I didn't--

12:18.215 --> 12:19.739
I got to go.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
I feel like I came
at a bad time.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.406
Oh, there she is. How'd it go
last night with Jerry?

12:35.450 --> 12:36.538
You two bump oldies?

12:38.540 --> 12:39.715
Oh, you didn't tell her?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.804
Yes, I talked to Jerry

12:41.848 --> 12:43.806
and made a complete ass
out of myself.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.808
It was so embarrassing.

12:45.852 --> 12:46.896
What happened?

12:46.940 --> 12:48.202
Jerry told me he didn't have

12:48.245 --> 12:49.594
any romantic feelings toward me

12:49.638 --> 12:51.509
and we were just
neighbors and friends.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.816
Gee, does that sound
familiar to you two?

12:53.860 --> 12:56.253
Yeah, that's exactly
what yousaid. Oh.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.431
I'm sorry, Mom, but all
the signs were there.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.085
It was so awkward.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.914
Plus, he still has my air fryer.
I'm never gonna see that again.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.481
So...

13:06.524 --> 13:08.570
just like that, no more Jerry.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.399
And by the way, why isn't Jerry
interested in me?

13:11.442 --> 13:14.358
The man has prescription
halitosis medication.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.839
I felt bad before.
Now I feel worse.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.713
Man, I was so sure.

13:21.757 --> 13:25.369
Uh, maybe the olds
just communicate differently.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.328
Yeah, I wouldn't show up
to someone's house

13:27.371 --> 13:29.417
unless I was
basically proposing.

13:30.984 --> 13:34.422
Maybe that lemon farmer
was just neighborly.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.554
Maybe he feared that
if he spoke his truth,

13:36.598 --> 13:38.600
his heart would be broken.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.691
Or whatever. I don't know.
Shut up!

13:44.649 --> 13:46.173
Mrs. Ferguson.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.565
Our next patient

13:47.609 --> 13:49.002
is a 70-year-old female

13:49.045 --> 13:51.439
admitted with chest
pains and dizziness.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.744
Dr. Jacobs,
why don't you take

13:52.788 --> 13:54.572
your stethoscope
and have a listen.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.661
Actually, sir,
we're running very behind.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.490
To speed things up, I grabbed
this portable ultrasound.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.362
It can give us
results in seconds.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.059
Well, that sounds like
the perfect solution

14:03.103 --> 14:06.454
for a doctor on the go.

14:06.497 --> 14:09.022
It connects directly to
your phone through Bluetooth.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.415
Boom! Check out this
picture quality.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.548
That is a clear
aortic stenosis.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.549
Guys, I thought
we were trying to--

14:14.592 --> 14:18.292
I'm holding her heart
in my hand.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.468
Well, if everyone's
excited about this,

14:20.511 --> 14:21.904
let me take a look.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.558
Just, uh,

14:23.601 --> 14:24.646
connecting
to Bluetooth.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.690
[phone vibrates]

14:25.734 --> 14:27.605
Uh, sir, you just

14:27.649 --> 14:29.999
AirDropped me photos of
a child's birthday party.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.047
Oh. That's my grandson Robbie.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.614
Boy, does he love
licking the ground.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.923
Ah, one of those days, huh?[chuckles]

14:40.967 --> 14:42.620
Little bit.
Something embarrassing

14:42.664 --> 14:43.883
happened in my personal life.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.754
Ah. Toilet paper
stuck to your shoe?

14:45.797 --> 14:47.147
[chuckles]:
Oh, no, worse.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.497
Oh. Well, you also have
toilet paper

14:49.540 --> 14:50.541
stuck to your shoe.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.761
Ah, of course I do.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.764
No, I just thought
someone was romantically

14:55.807 --> 14:58.680
interested in me, and it turns
out he just had too many lemons.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.551
Ah, easy mistake to make.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.771
No, he didn't think so.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.295
He seemed pretty horrified
by the idea.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.384
Oh, that's absurd.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.996
You have the grace
of a long-distance runner

15:10.039 --> 15:12.520
and the passion of
a short-distance runner.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.391
Wow, thank you.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.654
That means... something.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.091
[chuckles]

15:18.134 --> 15:20.789
Dr. Kenney, if I may say so,
that man's a damn fool.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.617
You are a catch and a half.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.581
Here she comes.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.236
Okay, we want to look sorry,
but not unforgivable.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.239
Okay.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.938
I can tell by the look
on your faces that you're sorry.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.330
And I forgive you.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.723
Nailed it.
Uh-uh.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.333
We feel bad
that we may have

15:43.377 --> 15:45.422
led you down
the wrong path with Jerry.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.989
So, we brought you
these gifts.

15:47.033 --> 15:50.253
It's a bag of lemon-flavored
protein bars from the gift shop.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.254
They're terrible.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.473
Aw.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.344
Thank you.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.956
You two are
manipulative monsters.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.828
But something kind of good
did come out of this.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.136
I realized I have been
wearing marriage glasses.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.659
And I think

16:04.702 --> 16:07.879
it might be time for me
to take them off.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.708
[Jenny and Lexie oohing]Gentlemen, I'm ready.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.624
Welcome to Carol's
grand opening!

16:15.148 --> 16:17.585
Mom, no.
No, don't say that.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.021
Ever to anyone.
Oh.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
But I'm really happy
you're ready to date.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.634
I have to admit, it was nice
to think that someone

16:23.678 --> 16:26.507
was interested for a minute,
even if it was just Jerry,

16:26.550 --> 16:30.032
who is the last person on Earth
I would ever want to be with.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.077
Carol!

16:32.252 --> 16:34.645
Jerry.

16:34.689 --> 16:35.603
What are you doing here?

16:35.646 --> 16:36.778
[sighs]

16:36.821 --> 16:38.736
I feel like
I should call security,

16:38.780 --> 16:42.610
but what if we just
let this play out for a minute?

16:42.653 --> 16:44.612
Carol, I'm about
to do something

16:44.655 --> 16:46.266
I should've done
a long time ago.

16:46.309 --> 16:49.182
I want to tell the whole
world that I love you.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.444
Oh, no.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.445
Oh, yes!

16:51.488 --> 16:53.490
Oh, boy.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.406
Carol, last night, I
was caught off guard.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.974
I've imagined that moment
between us for so long,

16:59.018 --> 17:00.584
I panicked.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.456
But the truth is...

17:02.499 --> 17:04.066
I love you.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.503
Jerry, you don't mean that.I do.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.897
I planted that lemon tree
just for you.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.639
Okay, that makes me nervous.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.685
[sighs] I have waited patiently
since your divorce,

17:14.729 --> 17:16.470
but our time is now.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.515
I didn't want to let
another minute go by

17:18.559 --> 17:20.126
without telling you how I feel.

17:20.169 --> 17:24.086
Okay, but just FYI, I would've
been home in, like, 45 minutes.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.526
Patient is a 30-year-old female
with shortness of breath,

17:29.570 --> 17:31.920
a slight fever
and a cough.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.356
Urgent care gave me
some antibiotics,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.184
but they only
made me feel worse.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.751
I'm so tired.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.753
Honestly, it's hard to walk
more than ten steps.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.538
[coughs] Plus, I can't
get rid of this stupid cough.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.757
It's so annoying.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.715
Interns,
what's your diagnosis?

17:44.759 --> 17:46.195
The weakness, fever
and persistent cough

17:46.239 --> 17:48.197
all point to
atypical pneumonia.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.592
If you look at
her chest ultrasound...

17:51.635 --> 17:54.986
you can see the fluid in
the lungs, indicating pneumonia.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.380
So, I'll start her on stronger
antibiotics and we can move on.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.817
I'd still like
to take a listen.
Oh.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.036
If you're having trouble
connecting your phone,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.777
you can use mine.
[chuckles]

18:02.820 --> 18:04.300
Well, no need.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.910
[clears throat]

18:05.954 --> 18:08.826
But just a warning,
if you put her on antibiotics

18:08.870 --> 18:11.133
for pneumonia, she'll die.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
Maybe don't put me
on the antibiotics.

18:15.572 --> 18:18.706
She doesn't have pneumonia.
She has a pleural effusion.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.925
And it's easy to misdiagnose.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.841
The fluid you saw in the
ultrasound isn't in her lungs.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.495
It's behind her lungs.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.410
And you can tell
by listening to her heart.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.455
Doctor, could you?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.720
You can hear it
struggling to pump.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.114
We need to start her
on a diuretic immediately

18:35.157 --> 18:36.811
to relieve pressure
from her lungs.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.030
Okay, I'll write
in the order.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.642
Ms. Ocampo,
you're gonna be just fine.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.034
I'd prefer it
if the gray-haired doctor

18:43.078 --> 18:44.819
did everything from now on.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.216
Sir, you got all that
from listening to her heart?

18:50.259 --> 18:51.956
That is...
Badass!

18:53.567 --> 18:55.221
Forgive me, sir.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.179
Technology is great,

18:57.223 --> 18:59.355
and I could stand to
embrace it a bit more,

18:59.399 --> 19:02.097
but it's no substitute
for clinical skill.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.795
We do everything
at such a high speed now

19:04.839 --> 19:07.537
that sometimes we don't take
the extra time to really listen.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.452
You're absolutely right,
Dr. Frost.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.237
Thank you for the reminder.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.586
You're welcome.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.718
Now, I know I look
impressive right now...

19:14.762 --> 19:17.373
[clears throat]

19:17.417 --> 19:19.070
...and I hate to admit this,
[clears throat]

19:19.114 --> 19:22.291
but somehow I've managed to
lock myself out of my phone.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.774
Can you believe they only
give you eight guesses?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.821
Hey, how did Jerry take it?
You let him down easy?

19:30.865 --> 19:32.258
I thought so,
but then

19:32.301 --> 19:34.216
last night he chopped down
the lemon tree.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.610
So... maybe it's for the best.

19:36.653 --> 19:39.178
Mm, yeah. Hey, Jerry wasn't
the right guy for you.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.744
That just means
someone else will be.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.616
Someone without halitosis.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.661
You're right.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.534
From now on, I'm gonna be open
to seeing romantic possibility

19:47.577 --> 19:50.232
wherever it may present itself.Mm-hmm.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.842
Dr. Kenney, just the person
I wanted to see.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.670
I have a gift for you.

19:53.714 --> 19:54.802
A gift?

19:54.845 --> 19:57.544
Yes, a very special gift,
just for you.

19:57.587 --> 19:58.893
A reflex hammer.[chuckles]

20:00.677 --> 20:03.245
Wow, I don't know
what to say.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.681
It's so thoughtful,
Dr. Frost.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.248
I'm-I'm flattered.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.902
And, Dr. Gilani,
I also have something

20:07.945 --> 20:09.730
very special for you.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.601
Oh, sweet! A reflex hammer!

20:11.645 --> 20:13.429
I've always wanted one of these.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.868
It's always just
a minute too late.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.834
All right, drain snaked.
Gross level: high.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.967
I could build you a man with the
hair that was lodged in there.

20:30.011 --> 20:30.968
Ew.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.622
We done now?
No.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.016
Your terrible advice
cost me my handy neighbor,

20:35.059 --> 20:37.366
so you're gonna be making
this up to me for a long time.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.238
Fine. What's next?

20:39.281 --> 20:42.066
Um, the knob
on the bannister is loose.

20:42.110 --> 20:45.113
Oh, and after that, can you go
outside and tackle the gutters?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.506
Mm, you got that, Jake?

20:46.549 --> 20:48.464
Yeah, bannisters, gutters.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.074
Right away.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.296
He's a good man.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.950
You two are terrible.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.038
[both laugh]

20:57.081 --> 20:58.605
But very fun.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.215
Now...

21:00.259 --> 21:02.261
let's prank-call
Caleb again.
Ooh, yeah.
