00:03.516 --> 00:05.065
- Hi.
- That's nice.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.079
Do you love her?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.439
I love you.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.599
But do you love her?

00:12.600 --> 00:14.759
If you care then why did
you fuck my best friend?

00:14.760 --> 00:15.839
Mins!

00:15.840 --> 00:19.399
I have decided that you will be
returning to Mayberry's after all.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.319
What??!

00:20.320 --> 00:22.079
So marry me,

00:22.080 --> 00:26.079
Grace Violet Blood.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.359
I do.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.079
I do.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.959
I do, I do, I do!

01:34.400 --> 01:38.399
Alo! Alo...!

01:40.320 --> 01:44.319
Alo, get me off the fucking roof!

01:44.960 --> 01:46.399
Shit, my balls!

03:28.600 --> 03:30.719
Stay away from Franky today.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.959
What are you, her bodyguard?

03:32.960 --> 03:36.319
No, I'm her best friend.
And I've been looking after her.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.359
Is she OK?

03:37.360 --> 03:40.559
No, she's not OK,
OK? You've made her ill.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.319
I haven't done anything.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.319
We all have to make an effort today
and that includes you, amazingly.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.839
I mean, you've done a pretty great
job ignoring her calls,

03:49.840 --> 03:53.839
so, please,
do not fuck with her head today.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.239
Promise me.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.199
Yes. I promise.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.199
Good. Toodles!

04:08.960 --> 04:11.199
Where are you off to so early?

04:11.200 --> 04:14.119
To, um, Liv's.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.399
To, like, say goodbye to everyone.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.199
OK.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.879
But we need to leave
the Mayberry's by one.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.999
- I could pick you up en route?
- No...

04:24.000 --> 04:27.999
It'll be fine. I'll be back.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.679
I have a little something for you.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.519
Oh... thank you.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.519
To new beginnings.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.799
There we go.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.799
Give Daddy a huggy-wuggy, then.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.599
Lovely.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.279
Just a trim, OK?

05:02.280 --> 05:06.279
Trust me, mate.
Grace is gonna love it.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.319
Ooh!

05:10.320 --> 05:11.599
A-a-ah!

05:11.600 --> 05:15.599
There, that's it.
That's it, good lad. Good, good lad.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.599
I feel violated.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.599
It's called wind
around your ears, mate.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.279
I look like...
Justin Bieber.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.719
- You take that back.
- All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.719
You, you look like a man who's
just made the ultimate sacrifice,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.839
for lurve.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.759
Right, er... rain check. Rings?

05:38.760 --> 05:40.599
You should know, best man.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.119
Oh, yeah.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.599
Er...

05:46.600 --> 05:48.759
- Suits are all sorted.
- Dare I ask how?

05:48.760 --> 05:51.919
Da and Dewi used to be in
a Beatles tribute band together.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.199
- I fished 'em out...
- I'm going to ignore that.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.839
Matty and Nick are taking care of...

05:58.840 --> 06:01.239
Catering's sorted, boss.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.479
Oh, my days, Justin Bieber!

06:03.480 --> 06:07.479
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck's sake.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.279
Hey, guys.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.479
All right?

06:19.480 --> 06:23.479
What's in the box?

06:25.440 --> 06:28.239
Ta-da!

06:28.240 --> 06:32.239
Dad made the cake.
And I made the dress.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.919
Wow.
Awesome, Franks.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.319
It's amazing, Franky.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.919
Put it on, then.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.159
Beautiful.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.679
Let's chill those jitters out, yeah?

07:08.400 --> 07:12.119
Better get the glad rags on, then.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.479
Need a hand?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.119
Um, VBL.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.519
Visible boxers' line.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.519
You smooth while I pull, OK?

07:42.320 --> 07:43.999
Do I look like a dick?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.799
No.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.719
You look...

07:47.720 --> 07:49.839
amazing.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.319
Now, remember what I said.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.319
- You...
- I deserve better.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.119
Oh, my God, they're here!

08:30.080 --> 08:34.078
Let's get these fuckers
to the slaughter!

09:26.160 --> 09:28.999
So, the vicar...?
All sorted.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.959
He's a bit... back street.
But it's all cool.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.959
Dewi had a word. They used to be
in a Beatles tribute band together.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.359
If one note of
All We fucking Need Is Love plays,

09:40.360 --> 09:42.999
I'm gonna piss
all over his organ, Al. I swear.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.439
Yes, all right, Richard.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.039
What's that?
Dewi did it himself.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.599
What, when everyone thought
the Earth was still flat?

09:52.600 --> 09:56.599
Alo, you do know how
to get there, don't you?

09:56.760 --> 10:00.759
Yeah, all sorted. Turn right here,
we'll be there in no time.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.039
Er, Alo, you sure about this?
Where are you taking us through?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.239
A special sort of short cut,
B route, Rich.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.239
What, through fucking Helmand?

10:19.840 --> 10:23.319
Well done, Alo. It's a dead end.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.239
Nah, it's fine. I can get round
that. Alo, no.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.439
I can make it.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.599
No!
See?

10:30.600 --> 10:34.599
Shit!

10:35.200 --> 10:37.039
Fuck's sake, Alo!
I told you, you never listen.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.079
I'm sorry, OK?

10:39.080 --> 10:43.079
There's your answer.

10:43.640 --> 10:47.639
Fucking idiot!

10:47.720 --> 10:50.079
- Everyone good?
- Yep.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.639
- All good.
- Yeah, all good.

11:02.520 --> 11:06.519
Shit!

11:06.800 --> 11:10.799
It's going nowhere. Everyone out.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.799
Anyone got reception?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.199
- Nope.
- Right...

11:18.200 --> 11:22.199
Let's get this show
back on the shitty road.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.079
I thought we had discussed
the Matthew situation.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.639
What?

11:30.640 --> 11:32.519
What the fuck
were you doing back there?

11:32.520 --> 11:36.519
I don't know, Mini, OK?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.639
Woo-hoo!

11:40.640 --> 11:44.639
- Put a donk on it, people!
- What the fuck is he on?

11:46.360 --> 11:50.359
- Franky?
- That's called grooming.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.799
May I have this dance?

12:03.760 --> 12:06.639
This isn't the motherfucking
reception, Franky.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.639
Guys, she's dead.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.599
What do you mean by "dead", Alo?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.559
You can fix it, right?

12:13.560 --> 12:17.559
Look! It's... it's a freaking angel!

12:17.680 --> 12:18.919
Oh, my God!

12:18.920 --> 12:20.239
Oh, no, it's a car.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.239
Of course it's a fucking car, Nick.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.879
Hello.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.879
We have to get married
in two hours at Chepston.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.719
Well, isn't that an alignment?
We're off to sell our creation at
their craft fair.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.759
What about the others?
They've got to be there.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.159
Well, we have to be. And...

12:40.160 --> 12:43.439
they will be. Right?

12:43.440 --> 12:45.799
My angel!

12:45.800 --> 12:48.439
- No, that's an angel.
- Leave the angel alone, Nick.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.079
What direction's it in, man?

12:50.080 --> 12:53.759
Cross country as the crow flies,
about an hour. Veer southwest.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.399
Thank you, my henna-handed honcho.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.959
Fingers!

12:59.960 --> 13:03.959
- Don't worry, dude.
- Everything will be OK.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.879
We'll be there.
Bye, guys.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.439
Have fun, kids.
Bye, honey.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.119
- I won't let you down, man!
- Bye.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.119
Bye.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.319
Maybe they're...

13:23.320 --> 13:27.319
post-apocalyptic savages, that'll eat
them alive and make, like,

13:27.800 --> 13:31.799
pants from their skin
and a fucking glockenspiel
from their bones and shit.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.999
- Shut the fuck up, Nick.
- Southwest.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.999
South... south...

13:42.440 --> 13:44.039
Alo...

13:44.040 --> 13:47.199
A horse shit!

13:47.200 --> 13:51.199
Farm boy, what the fuck?

13:51.680 --> 13:55.679
Once more unto the breach,
my friends.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.639
Now, who's with me?!

14:04.960 --> 14:08.959
Hey, Alo, you've got to teach me
that trick, man, with the shit.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.639
Luncheon already?
It's nearly one, David.

14:22.640 --> 14:26.639
How my idle morning has flown.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.879
Where on earth are you going?

14:51.880 --> 14:55.879
To retrieve our fugitive daughter.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.559
Pit stop, you beautiful wankers!

15:05.560 --> 15:08.679
We've only just started, you prick.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.679
One for the road, Mini.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.839
Beer rain! There is a God!

15:40.560 --> 15:42.399
What the fuck was that for?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.239
We've got our friend's wedding
to get to,

15:44.240 --> 15:46.919
Mr I Don't Give A Fuck
About Anything Or Anyone.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.919
- You're wrong, I do.
- What about our agreement?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.359
Mini?

15:55.360 --> 15:58.799
- What agreement?
- You deserve better, remember?

15:58.800 --> 16:01.239
Have you been saying shit
behind my back?

16:01.240 --> 16:04.639
I told him to stay away, OK?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.239
I can't hack this any more.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.959
Let's go.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.679
I'll see you at the church.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.239
No, no, no, we can't split up.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.719
I can get us there, I promise.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.199
Come with us. If you like.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.239
No way! She's staying right here.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.239
Come on, Franky.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.279
Franky, I... I'm trying
to protect you.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.599
Mini, I'll see you later, OK?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.679
He just wants to fuck you
and then fuck you up!

16:38.680 --> 16:42.679
Good.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.919
So you put an insect thingy on her?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.519
A bug. We'll catch her soon enough.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.239
She isn't a dog, David.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.239
Could you unwrap another Werther's
for me, please, Sonia?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.159
And each child rings a year
on the tree of our love

17:11.160 --> 17:12.959
we planted on our wedding day.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.679
- How many do you have, Crystal?
- 13.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.679
No more travelling the world
like a scag-injected tumbleweed.

17:21.079 --> 17:24.759
I rooted in the soil
of our marriage.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.559
- Diesel was a roadie.
- Oh, really? Who for?

17:27.560 --> 17:31.559
Throbbing Gristle, er, Alien Sex
Fiend, er... Napalm Death...

17:31.600 --> 17:32.959
No fucking way!

17:32.960 --> 17:36.639
Way, way wayward,
spiritually bereft.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.879
Bullshit.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.079
Now I hunter-gather!

17:41.080 --> 17:45.079
And I tend to his loin-fruits.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.919
I wonder how the gang are doing.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.919
Alo'll get 'em there.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.519
We're shafted... and it's all my
fault.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.639
Some fucking best man I am!

18:02.640 --> 18:06.639
Er, Als, you know
the negative shit's a real downer.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.079
I'm worried about Franky,
we shouldn't have left her.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.079
Something bad's going to happen
and I... and I can't stop it now.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.559
Well, if anyone can, McGuinness can.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.559
Go... or you'll regret it.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.679
Slide off me, sweatbox.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.559
But Nick needs a come-down cuddle.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.479
See you at the church, Alo!

18:34.480 --> 18:38.479
Ho-bag.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.839
I dunno. I mean,
we've still got to get there, right?

18:53.920 --> 18:57.079
Let go. You want to, right?

18:57.080 --> 19:00.799
A bit of mandy will help us along.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.879
OK.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.879
OK, cool.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.279
Shit.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.319
I'll ask him where we are.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.319
Watch my back.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.839
Er, good day... squire.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.839
Might this be like Chepston,
perchance?

19:58.640 --> 20:02.639
Can you tell me or does my boyf
have to give you a BJ first?

20:03.400 --> 20:04.759
Next one along.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.759
Thank you kindly.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.519
This is what we do.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.039
Er, Franks?

20:36.040 --> 20:38.119
We need to find a cab.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.959
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
some booze for the wedding first.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.919
Impressive!

20:46.440 --> 20:50.439
Come on, guys.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.239
Shit, Franks.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.239
Have you done this before?

21:56.160 --> 21:58.839
Game on... Mattster.

22:27.160 --> 22:31.159
It's OK.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.759
Let's go.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.399
Here, take this.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.279
I'll have your heads on the wall!

23:17.800 --> 23:20.999
And don't come back!

23:30.640 --> 23:33.559
It's called grunge revival, OK?!

23:33.560 --> 23:37.199
Oh, ground, swallow me whole, please.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.079
Oh, erm...

23:39.080 --> 23:43.079
Hi! Have you by any chance
seen, erm, two girls and a boy?

23:44.360 --> 23:45.559
Bugger off!

23:45.560 --> 23:49.559
Er, rudeness!

24:01.720 --> 24:03.159
Why did you stop me?

24:03.160 --> 24:06.319
- She isn't a fucking experiment.
- I thought that was what you wanted.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.759
I'm trying to fix us, Matty.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.959
I want you.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.959
I love you.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.479
But...

24:17.480 --> 24:21.479
But... it's not enough, is it?

24:23.960 --> 24:27.959
And all the chemicals in the world
can't make it enough.

24:29.240 --> 24:34.876
I'd swallow razor blades to see you
smile, but even that wouldn't do it.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.479
Look, Liv, please,
let's just catch her up.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.239
- I don't want her with us now, OK?
- She's off it, she'll get lost.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.359
And I won't?!

24:45.360 --> 24:49.359
No, Liv.

24:49.520 --> 24:53.519
You'll always be OK.

24:56.080 --> 25:00.079
And that girl will always be lost!

25:00.920 --> 25:02.439
Sure you ain't got pills, Al Capone?

25:02.440 --> 25:04.359
One more time.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.359
- One more fucking time!
- Al! Al!

25:06.360 --> 25:09.279
Al! Have you double-double-checked?

25:09.280 --> 25:13.279
No! I do not have any
pharma-fucking-ceuticals, Nicholas!

25:17.320 --> 25:18.519
Argh!

25:18.520 --> 25:20.559
Oh, don't take your dependency
out on me, all right?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.599
Now, come on, pick up the pace.

25:22.600 --> 25:26.599
One, two, three, four!

25:26.640 --> 25:30.639
Look, I'll roll you a spliff
if you pick the pace up to ten...

25:31.640 --> 25:34.479
I'm trapped! Ah!

25:34.480 --> 25:35.919
Fucking hell!

25:35.920 --> 25:38.079
Right, easy, easy, easy.

25:38.080 --> 25:42.079
Aaah!

25:42.800 --> 25:46.799
Like serpents coiled
in perpetual yin-yang mating.

25:47.480 --> 25:51.399
Spiritual Siamese twins
with male-to-female body parts.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.359
Your lives are one.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.719
My key fits her lock.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.799
His cotton bud cleans
my ear.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.599
To hear the glory of our
union!

26:00.600 --> 26:02.679
Slit my wrists now.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.719
What?

26:03.720 --> 26:04.759
Not long before...

26:04.760 --> 26:08.759
You're welded together forever.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.799
Ace.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.999
Go on without me!

26:14.000 --> 26:15.959
I'll die here alone.
It's all I deserve.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.399
Just keep your leg still, all right?
You're in a rabbit snare.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.639
Ow! Save yourself
andleave me to the bears!

26:21.640 --> 26:25.039
We're in Somerset, Nick!

26:25.040 --> 26:26.719
To the fucking squirrels, then!

26:26.720 --> 26:28.359
Ah!

26:28.360 --> 26:31.319
- Go!
- Just shut up, all right?

26:31.320 --> 26:35.319
Shut up and keep your frigging leg
still!

26:40.480 --> 26:42.759
Oh, bloody hell, Nick!

26:42.760 --> 26:44.879
- When did you last change these?!
- It's not them.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.159
That's the smell of a loser's death.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.039
You're not a loser.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.039
You're a bit of a prick,

26:52.040 --> 26:56.039
but peel away that prick...
and there's a good man in there.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.639
- Come on, big boy!
- No... No!

26:59.640 --> 27:02.959
- Arise, sire!
- Argh!

27:02.960 --> 27:05.719
My beer. I want my beer.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.879
No, let it go.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.879
- You're a good... good bloke, Alo.
- Yeah, I know.

27:20.120 --> 27:24.119
Liv!

27:29.840 --> 27:32.519
Where is, er... everyone else?

27:32.520 --> 27:34.399
Like Franky?

27:34.400 --> 27:38.399
- Your girl crush is so blatant.
- What?!

27:39.040 --> 27:41.799
Where's your man, then?

27:41.800 --> 27:45.799
I think I've... fucked things up,
big style.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.879
So... where is he?

27:49.880 --> 27:53.879
Looking for her.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.639
Oh... I'm afraid you've missed your
slot.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.559
I'm just starting
the born-again-agains' baptisms.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.079
But I could fit you in

28:24.080 --> 28:25.479
in an hour?

28:25.480 --> 28:29.439
Potentially.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.999
Oh, right.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.119
Ah. Oh, 16.23!

28:37.120 --> 28:40.519
And a Refresher! Done.

28:40.520 --> 28:44.359
Where's that young Creevey
and the rest of your party?

28:45.960 --> 28:48.999
Oh, well, there's almost an hour
yet.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.999
All you need is two witnesses.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.719
Uh...

28:56.720 --> 28:59.119
- They'll be here.
- You reckon?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.799
They have to be -
they're our friends, Rich.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.799
Let's just find two people
for, like, backup.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.959
Two people - easy.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.919
Oh, my God!

29:26.920 --> 29:29.239
- Come on!
- We're gonna live!

29:29.240 --> 29:31.319
- A road!
- We're gonna live!

29:31.320 --> 29:32.399
We're saved!

29:32.400 --> 29:34.399
But there's loads of room!

29:34.400 --> 29:38.399
Oh, very salubrious, Bertie.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.719
- Er, hi.
- Oh, hello, lad.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.479
Will you be here in an hour?

29:44.480 --> 29:48.479
- Oh, can't say!
- We've not got long.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.119
Oh, yeah, good one.
No way.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.079
We need two witnesses
so we can get married,

29:56.080 --> 29:59.319
cos everything's gone wrong and...
Please.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.399
Of course, dear, of course.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.839
In an hour, then.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.279
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah!

30:05.280 --> 30:09.279
- Yeah. OK.
- Thank you.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.879
Liv?

30:32.440 --> 30:36.439
Matty?

30:40.920 --> 30:42.599
Are you OK?

30:42.600 --> 30:46.599
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I thought...

30:48.520 --> 30:52.519
Where's Liv?

30:52.920 --> 30:55.319
I tried to stay away from you
and I can't.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.199
Here we are...

30:57.200 --> 31:00.199
It's not random.

31:00.200 --> 31:04.199
You feel it, right?

31:05.240 --> 31:07.599
I really want to fucking kiss you,
but I can't.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.519
Then why are you head-fucking me?!

31:10.520 --> 31:12.719
Franky, don't...

31:12.720 --> 31:16.719
Just as fucked in the head
as you are.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.759
You know, when I was six,

31:20.760 --> 31:24.759
teacher asked me
to think of something beautiful.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.119
I said 9/11.

31:30.520 --> 31:34.519
Saw it on the TV in this care home
with the sound on mute.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.679
Teacher told me how many people
had died.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.199
And all the other kids
in the class cried,

31:42.200 --> 31:46.199
and I knew then that I was...

31:46.280 --> 31:50.279
wrong.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.479
I guess

31:53.480 --> 31:57.479
that's why my parents gave me up.

31:57.480 --> 32:01.039
Because they knew, too...

32:01.040 --> 32:05.039
right from the beginning.

33:22.240 --> 33:26.239
- Franky?
- Get off me. Get off me!

33:30.920 --> 33:34.919
Franky, wait! Franky!

33:36.480 --> 33:40.479
Franky, come back! Franky!

33:40.960 --> 33:43.279
- Please...
- What the hell happened?

33:43.280 --> 33:47.279
What the fuck have you done?

33:47.840 --> 33:51.559
Franky!

33:51.560 --> 33:55.319
Franky, please, come back!

33:55.320 --> 33:59.319
Franky!

34:06.160 --> 34:10.159
Franky!

34:12.320 --> 34:13.918
Franky!

34:21.520 --> 34:23.399
Franky!

34:23.400 --> 34:25.279
Can you see her?

34:25.280 --> 34:29.279
She's here! Franky, hold on!

34:30.400 --> 34:33.079
- Take my hand, Franky.
- Go away.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.958
Please, Franky!

34:35.960 --> 34:37.679
Franky, take my hand!

34:37.679 --> 34:40.599
Franky, please, please!

34:40.600 --> 34:43.478
I'm so sorry, Franky!

34:43.480 --> 34:47.478
Come on, please, take my hand.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.839
OK!

35:02.560 --> 35:06.559
Want a hand?

35:13.320 --> 35:17.319
OK?

35:25.480 --> 35:29.319
Franky... did he...

35:29.320 --> 35:30.479
hurt you?

35:30.480 --> 35:34.479
It's not what it looks like, Liv.
I swear, she just lost it.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.439
I just... wanted to feel...

35:41.640 --> 35:45.639
normal.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.919
Ah!

35:59.920 --> 36:01.879
David fucking Blood!

36:01.880 --> 36:05.879
Shit.

36:06.040 --> 36:10.039
- Oh...
- Oh, fucking...

36:12.040 --> 36:15.999
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop, please!

36:35.200 --> 36:39.199
- They went and got battered.
- They're supposed to be
our friends.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.399
Just us now.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.919
This is so not what I dreamed of.

36:44.920 --> 36:48.399
Why did you cut your lovely hair?

36:48.400 --> 36:52.399
I asked for a trim.

36:52.440 --> 36:56.439
Guess I look the part, I suppose.
Mr and Mrs Mainstream.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.079
Did you actually think
that's what I wanted?

37:01.080 --> 37:03.559
Grace!

37:23.000 --> 37:24.119
Blood is coming!

37:24.120 --> 37:25.759
But my bridesmaids...!

37:25.760 --> 37:29.439
- Nick, do the honours.
- Bring it on.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.039
All we need is love.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.159
Great.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.639
All we need is...

38:07.640 --> 38:09.159
To get on with the service.

38:11.640 --> 38:15.639
Not on God's holy earth.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.159
How did you know I was here?

38:19.160 --> 38:21.199
He put an electric
insect thing on you.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.239
A bug, for the billionth time.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.039
I'm your daughter, not al-Qaeda.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.759
You are coming home with us.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.599
Hey, Grace.

38:29.600 --> 38:33.519
You're all here!

38:33.520 --> 38:36.719
Look at what this motley crew
have done to our little girl.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.319
I'm not your little girl.

38:39.320 --> 38:43.279
Her future's hers, David, not ours.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.839
You...

38:44.840 --> 38:48.839
you corrupters are
all, all, expelled.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.719
You can't do that, sir.

38:55.720 --> 38:59.719
Oh, look how the mighty
have fallen.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.119
Yeah. I fell...

39:03.120 --> 39:06.479
down a f...

39:06.480 --> 39:10.479
reaking k-hole, actually,
but these guys caught me.

39:10.720 --> 39:14.719
It's what mates do.
Cos it's screwed up out there.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.959
I don't know if you've been outside
lately, but it is. But we have a go.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.559
Whatever comes,
we have a good go at it.

39:24.640 --> 39:28.239
Cos it's all we can do.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.599
Right, then, so be it.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.599
But we shall take no further part
in this ridiculous melodrama.

39:43.920 --> 39:47.919
Sonia!

39:51.960 --> 39:54.959
So, are we going to, you know...

39:54.960 --> 39:56.999
get married?

39:57.000 --> 39:59.479
Don't ever cut your hair again.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.439
Not gonna.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.439
It'll grow. You're still my
metal man, my own Tin Man.

40:12.320 --> 40:16.319
So things are good, right, with us?

40:17.280 --> 40:21.279
Yeah. So do we
really need to change things?

40:21.520 --> 40:25.519
You could just take me
to be your boyfriend.

40:26.240 --> 40:30.239
Totally.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.879
I can't walk any more.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.879
Like, ever again.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.639
Hark!

40:57.640 --> 41:01.639
I sense merriment afoot.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.919
Let's go!

41:08.920 --> 41:10.599
Alo!

41:12.120 --> 41:13.599
Oh, please...

41:13.600 --> 41:15.519
Alo!

41:15.520 --> 41:17.119
I can't even walk!

41:17.120 --> 41:21.119
Alo, where the fuck are you going?

41:27.280 --> 41:31.279
Woo-hoo! Woo!

41:39.240 --> 41:40.839
Take a piece of cake.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.199
Take it, take it.

41:55.800 --> 41:59.799
I told you! Yes! Yes!

42:00.440 --> 42:03.759
Ta-da!

42:03.760 --> 42:07.759
OK!

42:17.680 --> 42:21.679
It's not your fault.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.319
We had a good day, didn't we?

42:25.320 --> 42:26.239
What?

42:26.240 --> 42:30.239
The day we met.

42:31.480 --> 42:35.479
I don't want to fuck
with that memory any more.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.359
Let's just...

42:47.360 --> 42:51.359
see it out in style.

43:22.120 --> 43:25.079
Are you OK?

43:25.080 --> 43:26.639
I used to...

43:26.640 --> 43:28.719
beam myself away,

43:28.720 --> 43:30.919
go somewhere in my head

43:30.920 --> 43:33.679
where I felt less...

43:33.680 --> 43:35.999
weird.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.999
You're not.

43:42.640 --> 43:46.399
Who'd have thought,
the three of us sharing a peace pipe?

43:46.400 --> 43:50.399
Let's try not to fuck it this time.

43:56.880 --> 44:00.879
You're missing
my not-wedding-after-party.

45:39.920 --> 45:43.919
We are a mess, we are failures
and we love it!

45:46.640 --> 45:50.639
We are a mess, we are failures
and we love it!

45:55.200 --> 45:59.199
We are a mess, we are failures
and we love it!

46:03.360 --> 46:07.359
We are a mess, we are failures
and we love it!
