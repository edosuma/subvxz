00:05.092 --> 00:07.007
<i>Previously on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:07.050 --> 00:08.138
<i>She was dealing with a lot.</i>

00:08.182 --> 00:09.531
Maybe she needed
to deal with that alone.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.446
I know she did,
'cause she told me.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.056
I don't know how
to be a single man.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.363
Your profile is set to only
matches over 90 years old.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.017
If you just toggle that--

00:17.060 --> 00:18.322
Oh, my gosh.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.237
<i>I'm looking
for a Horace Reynolds.</i>

00:20.281 --> 00:22.674
Hey, look, I heard
he got really sick.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.112
It sounds like
a textbook example of someone

00:25.155 --> 00:27.157
with bipolar disorder.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.594
<i>There's been a change
of plans.</i>

00:29.638 --> 00:32.510
I think I might
have to crash here.

00:32.554 --> 00:36.123
The truth is
you'd be doing me a favor.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.791
Hmm.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.097
Somebody's been practicing.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.403
Yeah, yeah.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.100
Found a nice deaf instructor
on YouTube

00:57.144 --> 00:59.407
who convinced me to go premium.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.934
You roll--y--

01:04.977 --> 01:06.675
I just got the word "you."

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
Rolling--will you help me here?

01:12.768 --> 01:13.856
I think you got this.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.292
You do?

01:24.171 --> 01:26.782
Was it roll?

01:28.914 --> 01:32.135
Who--who door clock?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.355
No, sorry.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.750
Who are you door--

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
who are you door punching?
That doesn't make any sense.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.016
Here.
Would you just...

01:44.060 --> 01:46.454
type it?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.587
Please.
- Hmm.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.118
Hmm.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.295
Great.
Thank you.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.486
- We're all here.
- What's the big news?

02:18.529 --> 02:20.444
You dating another
married woman?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.968
Ladies, ladies.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.014
Let's give him some grace, huh?

02:25.057 --> 02:27.190
Floyd, what's going on?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.236
Right.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.063
So as you all know,
I've been spending

02:31.107 --> 02:32.935
a lot of time with Dad.
- Floyd.

02:32.978 --> 02:36.547
And I think that there
may be an explanation

02:36.591 --> 02:39.420
for his behavior
through all these years.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.729
I think he has
bipolar disorder.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.821
Why on Earth
would you think that?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.172
Well, he was acting
very strangely the other day,

02:52.215 --> 02:54.870
and the chair of psychiatry
suggested to me that his--

02:54.913 --> 02:57.829
Have you lost your mind
along with him?

02:57.873 --> 03:00.484
Oh, come on, Mama,
can't you see it?

03:00.528 --> 03:02.617
The erratic behavior,
his--his mania,

03:02.660 --> 03:04.314
all those awful stories
you told us

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
about how he behaved
before he left--

03:05.924 --> 03:07.230
it all makes sense now.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.580
Floyd, lots of people
have issues,

03:09.624 --> 03:11.234
but they find a way
to stick around.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.411
Your father didn't leave us
because he was mentally ill.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.980
He left us because he didn't
love us enough to try!

03:18.023 --> 03:19.286
OK, OK.
All right.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.679
Well, let's not repeat
his mistake, right?

03:21.723 --> 03:25.335
Let's--let's find
enough love to reach out.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.468
The only way
to cut through decades

03:27.511 --> 03:30.340
of untreated mental illness
is just to show him

03:30.384 --> 03:32.255
what he could have
if he tries--

03:32.299 --> 03:35.258
a family.
- Oh.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.173
I don't wanna hear this.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.263
Lost his mind.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.222
I honestly didn't
think you could top

03:42.265 --> 03:45.094
having a baby in a threesome.

03:49.794 --> 03:50.926
Hmm.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.670
<i>♪ Bury me alive
or just kill me ♪</i>

03:55.713 --> 03:59.195
<i>♪ 'Cause honestly I'm tired
of just feeling ♪</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:03.068

04:24.394 --> 04:25.395
What are you--

04:25.439 --> 04:27.919
put that plate back.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.225
It's dirty.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.966
Yeah, this is
also my apartment.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.889
How about some breakfast?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.369
God, no.

04:45.067 --> 04:51.247
Where are the--where are
the pills I had here?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.380
Oh, I took those hours ago.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.821
God, Mom screwed us up.

05:09.134 --> 05:12.399
So, listen, there is work
being done on my apartment,

05:12.442 --> 05:14.314
like some really involved
plumbing thing.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.967
It's gonna be
at least a month,

05:16.011 --> 05:18.056
and I was thinking
that maybe I could stay--

05:18.100 --> 05:19.536
Hell no.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.845
I'll pay rent.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.111
All right, fine,

05:29.154 --> 05:31.722
but you're paying up front.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.028
Because who knows
when you're going

05:33.071 --> 05:35.073
to disappear on me again?

05:43.517 --> 05:44.996
Oh, big mistake.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.476
Big, huge.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.956
Are you quoting
"Pretty Woman"?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.392
Yes, because those
dead-eyed bitches

05:49.436 --> 05:51.176
snubbing Vivian
is the same level of dumb

05:51.220 --> 05:52.961
as you moving in
with your sister.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.354
You're sober, Lauren.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.485
You can't handle
that kind of temptation.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.921
What I can't handle
is guilt, OK?

05:56.965 --> 05:58.836
She's a mess because
I left her there with my mom.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.012
She's a mess
because she gobbles up drugs

06:01.056 --> 06:02.536
like they're Skittles.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.712
A sober person living with her
isn't gonna change that.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.366
You haven't told her
you're sober?

06:06.409 --> 06:07.367
- Not yet.
- When?

06:07.410 --> 06:08.455
- Soon.
- Tonight.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.108
I miss Casey.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.806
I'll take this one.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.243
Fire at a wedding venue
caused a stampede for the exit.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.679
Groom was crushed
against the wall.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.202
Mostly likely broken ribs.
- OK, O2 stats are low.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.856
Respirations are high.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.205
Let's get him to Trauma 1
and prepare for intubation.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.555
- Got another one.
- On it.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.600
Cordelia Kaplan, 32,
minor abrasions

06:23.644 --> 06:25.210
and severe smoke inhalation.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.473
OK, vitals are stable.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.648
Let's park her
at the nurse's station

06:27.691 --> 06:30.564
and get her on 100% O2.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.304
Hey, how many more
can we expect?

06:32.348 --> 06:33.741
The whole damn wedding.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.485
Hey, page everyone.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.541
Hey, where do you want me?

06:51.585 --> 06:53.891
Bay 27.
Ring bearer with facial lac.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.894
Hey, nice suit.

06:56.938 --> 07:00.724
- Collapsed lung?
- 70% on chest X-ray.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.422
OK.
I will place the chest tube.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.685
You take the esophageal rupture
up to the OR.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.426
- On it.
- How can I help?

07:06.469 --> 07:07.731
Is there a vax set?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.516
Wilder's in Trauma 1.
Massive bleed.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.387
Copy.
Excuse me.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.000
Hey, where are we?

07:16.044 --> 07:18.002
We got
a lacerated femoral artery.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.613
Trying to close him up,
but I can't stop the bleed.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.224
He's the groom.
- How's the pressure?

07:22.267 --> 07:24.531
106/58.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.795
Thank you.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.930
Severe cyanosis
on both hands.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.671
Wait, wait, wait on the blood.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.194
It's O negative.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.544
Check his pockets.

07:43.201 --> 07:46.814
His blood type
is Lutheran B negative.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.772
His cells have an atypical
protein, making it very rare.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.470
What does that mean?

07:50.513 --> 07:52.080
It means that O negative is
not a universal blood for him,

07:52.123 --> 07:53.690
and it could kill him.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.171
Hey, do we have any
Lutheran B negative on hand?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.215
No.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.787
OK, Ellie, well, it's
looking pretty cleaned out,

08:03.831 --> 08:05.310
so we'll get you
a couple stitches,

08:05.354 --> 08:06.877
and we'll get you out of here.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.706
Your mom's gonna be OK.
- See?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.492
Everything's gonna be OK,
just like I told you.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.585
Lily?

08:18.628 --> 08:21.283
You doing OK, Lily?

08:21.326 --> 08:23.807
That's a beautiful bouquet.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.462
Should we get them some water?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.811
Honey?

08:27.855 --> 08:29.509
Can you tell me
how you're feeling, Lily?

08:32.207 --> 08:33.643
OK, you stay right here.

08:33.687 --> 08:34.818
I'm gonna go
and get some water.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.646
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.865
Close her up.
- On it.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.170
- Iggy?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.476
Put it up over your nose.
Deep breaths, okay?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.999
Yeah?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.784
OK, so the flower girl,
she's got no visible injuries,

08:43.827 --> 08:45.612
but she's unresponsive
to verbal and physical cues.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.657
OK, oh, yeah,
I'll check that out.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.486
Deep breaths, OK?
Deep, slow.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.538
You have to clear this area.
I'm so sorry.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.539
Whoa!

09:05.066 --> 09:06.937
This is why
I'm never getting married.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.639
Ottawa usually has two
frozen units, but they're out.

09:12.682 --> 09:13.335
OK, so what's
the next closest?

09:13.378 --> 09:14.728
- Perth.
- Australia?

09:14.771 --> 09:16.294
It's 26 hours away.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.514
Our guy has maybe 12 hours
before complete organ failure.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.647
I mean, this is why
rare blood banks exist.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.911
How can none of them have any?
- Seriously?

09:23.954 --> 09:26.478
Covid, staffing limitations,
poor donor turnout.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.306
Mexico City has nothing.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.660
You're smiling.
You're smiling.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.749
Does that mean somebody--

09:35.792 --> 09:38.316
Toronto General has two units
of Lutheran B negative

09:38.360 --> 09:39.535
ready to make the trip.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.841
I'm gonna get
the helicopter ready.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.190
I will go find the bride

09:42.233 --> 09:43.365
and let her know
that her wedding day

09:43.408 --> 09:44.714
is finally looking up.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.457
It was just awful.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.981
Not the venue,
which I had my doubts about,

09:51.025 --> 09:52.809
but turned out
to be quite lovely

09:52.853 --> 09:54.506
until all hell broke loose.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.160
Well, the good news is
is most of these cuts

09:56.204 --> 09:57.684
appear to be superficial.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.424
Let's start hitting them
with antibiotic ointment,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.209
and let's get as many
of them glued as possible.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.037
- On it.
- What happened to your elbow?

10:03.080 --> 10:05.343
Oh, my.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.259
I'm deformed!
- I'm sorry.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.044
I'm sure this isn't what
you pictured when you RSVP'd.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.133
Ow.
No, it wasn't.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.615
Knowing the family, I expected
subpar food and a cash bar,

10:15.658 --> 10:18.574
but not an explosion
during the I dos.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.620
An explosion?
I thought it was a fire.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.099
Kaboom.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.232
Suddenly, the room was full
of smoke, the thick kind,

10:24.275 --> 10:26.408
like at Korean barbecue.
- Oh.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.670
And you said
you're feeling back pain?

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
Oh, like when
you swallow wrong,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.152
and it feels like
the food is stabbing your back

10:31.195 --> 10:32.588
from the inside.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.721
Dr. Turan,
help me get him on the side.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.244
Nice and easy,
nice and easy, now.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.419
You got it.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.681
Were you
at the wedding alone?

10:38.725 --> 10:41.466
Alone?
I've been married for 40 years.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.294
I'm never anywhere alone.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.775
My wife's a few beds over.
Glad she's OK.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.037
The minute it happened,

10:47.081 --> 10:48.299
everyone started
screaming, running.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.997
My wife needed me,
and I couldn't find her.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.259
Oh!

10:51.302 --> 10:52.869
All right,
start an IV of Toradol.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.741
All right, Stan, I'm gonna have
to cut off your tux.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.177
But it's a rental.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.832
Agh!
Oh.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.355
That actually feels better.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.878
Pass me some of those 4x4s.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.445
I'm gonna get started
on this side.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.751
Set aside a week.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.187
Do you have
any idea what could have

11:06.230 --> 11:08.668
caused so many tiny cuts?
- I don't know.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.627
Maybe when I ran through
the champagne glass tower.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
- Face-first.
- Need to irrigate.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.370
You sure
you didn't fall on your back?

11:15.413 --> 11:17.633
Yes, because I remember
pushing myself up,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.766
like a push-up,
to look for Tamara.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.725
That's when the entire wedding
ran across my back.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.642
Everything look OK?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.166
Is there any chance
you might have been shot?

11:29.210 --> 11:31.299
- Shot?
- Who would do that?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.257
Who would erect
a 10-foot-tall crystal monster

11:33.301 --> 11:34.868
in the middle of a party?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.696
Even if there hadn't been
an explosion,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.785
someone was going
through that thing.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.134
All right.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.657
Well, I think
you're good to go.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.311
Oh, but what about my ankle?

11:43.354 --> 11:45.269
Tamara, wow.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.923
It's just the wedding
that keeps on giving.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.795
- Uh-huh.
- OK, OK.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.666
Ow, ow!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.320
Is it broken?

11:52.363 --> 11:53.625
Sprained is my guess,
but we should

11:53.669 --> 11:55.976
probably get an X-ray
just to be safe.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.978
Ow.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.327
What?

11:59.370 --> 12:01.068
Go ahead and dress the wound.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.765
Oh, how's Tamara Leckie doing?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.375
Well, I think
she's done with weddings,

12:04.419 --> 12:06.551
but she's gonna be fine.
How's her husband?

12:06.595 --> 12:08.162
Well, I was convinced
he had been shot,

12:08.205 --> 12:09.163
but there's
three inches of something

12:09.206 --> 12:10.338
jammed through his back.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.818
What do you mean, something?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.210
It's definitely not a bullet,
but whatever it is,

12:13.254 --> 12:14.777
it's long and thin.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.783
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:20.827 --> 12:21.828
Just give me
a few minutes.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.179
Hi.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.441
Hey, Lily.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.225
So I thought
it might be helpful

12:28.269 --> 12:29.487
to get you out
of all that chaos

12:29.531 --> 12:31.228
for a few minutes, right?

12:31.272 --> 12:32.403
A little peace and quiet.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.973
Also, Lily, your mom is
right outside of that window,

12:37.017 --> 12:39.323
so if you need her
for anything, you let me know.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.369
I'll take you right to her.
Deal?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.157
Bit of good news,

12:47.201 --> 12:48.550
your physical exams
all came back,

12:48.593 --> 12:51.379
and they show
no bodily harm whatsoever.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.517
I don't know
what you saw at that wedding.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.912
I bet it was really scary,
but I promise you,

13:02.956 --> 13:04.958
you are safe now.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.268
- Safe now.
- Yes.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.705
Yes, safe.
I promise.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.841
Lily, do you think I can
ask you some questions?

13:22.584 --> 13:25.979
Lily, do you think I can
ask you some questions?

13:33.203 --> 13:36.728
Lily, I need you to try
to stay with me please.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.296
Please.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.910
Please.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.439
OK, I'll be right back.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.444
I saw her speaking.
That's good, right?

13:56.487 --> 14:00.361
So this is not...

14:00.404 --> 14:02.754
just trauma.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.844
Your daughter
is suffering from catatonia.

14:06.193 --> 14:09.892
That's not--she just needs
to go home and rest.

14:09.936 --> 14:13.374
No, she needs to be admitted
to the behavioral health ward.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.505
Right now.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.776
- No pulse.
- Go again.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.694
He's back.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.479
The blood just arrived
in New York.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.872
- I need it here.
- I know.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.786
They should be calling me
any second.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.963
- How'd the bride react?
- I couldn't find her.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.138
They must have
taken her to Baptist.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.748
Hold on.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.054
Yeah.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.533
Let's get more Propofol.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.667
No, no, no.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.060
I don't really care
about protocol.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.931
There's
an extenuating circumstance.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.150
I have--can you--

14:50.193 --> 14:52.892
if you'd listen--

14:59.637 --> 15:00.943
The blood is stuck in customs.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.249
Homeland Security
won't release it

15:02.292 --> 15:03.206
for two to three days.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.212
This man
will be dead before that.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.394
Yeah, hi,
this is Dr. Max Goodwin,

15:17.438 --> 15:18.830
medical director
of New Amsterdam.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.136
Can you do me a favor
and connect me with the head

15:20.180 --> 15:22.269
of Memorial's rare blood bank?

15:22.312 --> 15:24.271
So you're OK letting
a precious lifesaving resource

15:24.314 --> 15:26.099
rot in a warehouse
because of red tape?

15:26.142 --> 15:28.666
Yes, yes, that's two units
of Lutheran B negative.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.842
Memorial Hospital in Seattle
said you might have some.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.410
Just say you are OK with
someone dying because of it.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.282
I will leave you alone.
- You're my fifth call.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.371
- You are my ninth call.
- Lutheran B negative.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.764
- You are my 11th call.
- You're my 14th--

15:39.808 --> 15:40.809
- Call.
- No?

15:45.553 --> 15:47.294
What?
I know.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.643
I know it's a long shot,
but this guy

15:48.686 --> 15:50.384
is getting married today,
and I was kind of hoping

15:50.427 --> 15:52.734
for a miracle.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.955
You're not gonna believe it.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.826
You found
Lutheran B negative?

15:57.869 --> 15:59.480
I found Rh-null.

15:59.523 --> 16:02.744
- Are you serious?
- Sorry. What is Rh-null?

16:02.787 --> 16:05.442
Rh-null is the only
universal blood for people

16:05.486 --> 16:07.096
with rare blood types.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.098
One in 3,000 people
who have Lutheran B negative,

16:09.142 --> 16:12.014
but less than 50 people
have ever been known

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
to have Rh-null.
I mean ever.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.323
That's why they call it--
- Golden blood.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.281
And there are
two fresh units of it

16:18.325 --> 16:19.891
waiting for us
at a small hospital

16:19.935 --> 16:22.024
in Hamilton, Bermuda.

16:22.068 --> 16:26.159
- In Bermuda?
- 90 minutes away.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.769
That won't help us.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.379
Any blood that we import
is gonna get stuck in customs.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.381
I know, and that's why we're
not gonna import the blood.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.253
OK, so what
are we gonna do?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.994
We're gonna
import the donor.

16:35.037 --> 16:38.736
And we're gonna leave
in 45 minutes.

16:38.780 --> 16:39.911
<i>♪ 'Cause when you see me</i>

16:44.394 --> 16:47.528
So the medical director
of Hamilton United designated

16:47.571 --> 16:49.356
two units of Rh-null blood
to be released to you

16:49.399 --> 16:51.227
upon completing
this export request.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.577
Actually, change of plans.
We don't need the blood.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.797
We just need the--

16:55.840 --> 16:57.451
the donor.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.764
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid, unfortunately,

17:06.808 --> 17:08.201
donor information
is confidential.

17:08.244 --> 17:09.767
They may not even live here.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.204
People donate
in other cities all the time.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.901
Mm-hm,
but the two units of blood

17:12.944 --> 17:14.337
set aside for me
weren't frozen,

17:14.381 --> 17:16.600
which means they were donated
in the last 42 days,

17:16.644 --> 17:18.559
and this bank
has had a steady supply

17:18.602 --> 17:20.865
of Rh-null
since 2017, which tells me

17:20.909 --> 17:22.215
that the donor does live here.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.782
I just really need you
to tell me where that is.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.175
Understood.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.090
Again, I cannot give out
personal information.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.352
You can.
You can, actually.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.224
We have--

17:31.267 --> 17:34.053
Sir, would you mind just--

17:34.096 --> 17:35.793
just taking a look
at the donor's file.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.230
You don't have
to show it to us.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.406
Just take a look at it.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.585
OK.
I'm looking at it.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.718
OK, now look
at all the donations

17:47.762 --> 17:50.591
that he or she has given
in the last five years.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.115
I mean, think about all
the lives that they have saved.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.944
This is--
this is someone who really

17:55.987 --> 17:57.685
wants to help other people.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.952
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't just--

18:03.995 --> 18:05.258
Listen...

18:05.301 --> 18:06.563
All I can give you
is the forms.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.608
Somebody's gonna die
unless you

18:07.651 --> 18:08.783
give us this information.
No, what?

18:08.826 --> 18:10.176
- No, it's fine.
- It's not fine.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.222
No, we--we flew here for--
what are you--

18:13.266 --> 18:14.310
We should go.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.442
It's fine.
- Thank you.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.313
- Hey, thank you.
- Have a good day.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.750
Uh, I'm sorry.
What--what was that?

18:19.794 --> 18:21.839
I mean, what was that?
Will you help me out?

18:21.883 --> 18:24.494
We came all this way, and you
push me out of the room?

18:24.538 --> 18:26.583
I'm one minute away.
What?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.803
There's no need.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.544
He looked at the donor's file
long enough

18:30.587 --> 18:31.806
for me to get this.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.155
What is that?

18:37.377 --> 18:40.031
That's the donor's address.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.990
How?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.644
Well, when you're deaf,

18:43.687 --> 18:45.472
you pay a lot more attention
to reflections.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.170
You know, like, glasses,
for example.

18:48.214 --> 18:51.521
- Hm.
- Oh, you're good.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.176
I know.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.178
- She's good.
- I know.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.180
- Let's go!
- Well, let's go.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.574
Yeah, we're going, OK.
- All right.

19:00.617 --> 19:04.230
She's tenacious.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.322
Oh, my Lord.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.412
Yep, that definitely
is a high heel.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.501
Yeah, and it is
really in there.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.938
You were trying to rescue me,

19:16.981 --> 19:19.027
like my knight
in shining armor,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.681
and I trampled you.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.249
- Honey, honey.
- Don't be nice to me.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.728
I ran over you like roadkill.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.209
You've been walking
all over me for 40 years.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.776
Now we have a picture
to commemorate it.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.866
The good news is that it
missed all your vital organs.

19:31.909 --> 19:35.478
Which means that,
despite the last several hours,

19:35.522 --> 19:37.219
you two are actually
pretty lucky.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.398
- Whoa, whoa!
- Tamara!

19:42.442 --> 19:44.661
- Need a little help here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:44.705 --> 19:45.967
Do not move, OK?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.142
If the heel moves
in the wrong way,

19:47.186 --> 19:48.709
you could die.
- But what's happening?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.232
There's nothing
blocking her airways.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.799
All right, all right.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.670
OK, OK.
I got you.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.542
I got--wait, what's--

19:55.585 --> 19:57.239
what are these cuts?
What are all these cuts?

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
When everyone
rushed the door,

19:58.588 --> 20:01.243
she crashed
into the champagne tower.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.375
She inhaled the glass.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.463
It's shredding
her intestines.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.899
We need to get her
to an OR now.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.207
Is she gonna be OK?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
Hey.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.047
The waiting is hell, I know.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.661
Did the doctors explain
the meds she's on?

20:27.704 --> 20:30.446
They tried.
I could barely focus.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.144
Was it benzo
something, something?

20:33.188 --> 20:36.539
Benzodiazepine, yeah.
It's basically a calming agent.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
It's often very effective
at easing people

20:38.324 --> 20:40.630
out of catatonic states, so...

20:43.154 --> 20:45.156
Often, not always?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.204
Yeah.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.211
What if she
doesn't come back?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.473
Hey, hey.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.433
I promise you we're doing
everything we can.

21:00.476 --> 21:03.262
OK?
- She's got to wake up.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.916
Please make her wake up.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.310
I keep replaying it in my mind.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.964
After that maniac
started the fire,

21:10.007 --> 21:12.880
she must have been so scared.
- I'm sorry.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.274
I thought--someone started
the fire on purpose?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.666
I thought it was an explosion.

21:19.016 --> 21:22.150
Protect your children.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.153
We all need
to protect our children.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.374
What's happening?

21:28.417 --> 21:30.854
- I need a team in here now!
- She's seizing!

21:30.898 --> 21:33.466
- Crash cart!
- I'm right behind you.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.250
Come on, guys,
make room, make room.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.296
- All right, on it.
- Call zero stats.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.298
- Paging OR 3.
- Start on Lorazepam drip.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.697
- Give me an army-navy.
- But there's no time to work--

21:47.741 --> 21:50.047
Heart rate's rising.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.572
- She's bleeding.
- From where?

21:52.615 --> 21:55.357
I cleared the stomach.
No glass.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.229
BP's dropping.
Give me another unit a blood.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.796
Must have passed
into her small intestine.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.321
I'm gonna run the valve.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.151
OK.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.812
All right,
how are you doing, Stan?

22:18.859 --> 22:21.905
I abandoned my wife.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.430
Stan, even if you didn't
have a serious injury,

22:24.473 --> 22:26.736
there's no way they would have
let you in the OR with her.

22:26.780 --> 22:31.132
No, I abandoned her
at the wedding.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.965
A tetanus jab, please.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.445
When I heard
that explosion,

22:39.488 --> 22:41.011
I just took off.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.058
I didn't look for her.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.886
I didn't even think about her.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.106
I ran.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.240
I left her behind.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.981
Now she might die
because of it.

22:54.024 --> 22:57.637
Hey, you can't
blame yourself for that.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.986
Watch me.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.770
Oh, you don't know
what it is to know

23:00.814 --> 23:04.165
you failed someone you love...

23:04.208 --> 23:07.690
to know they're hurt
because of you.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.258
And you think
back to that moment,

23:10.301 --> 23:13.348
wishing you could have
done something different,

23:13.392 --> 23:16.917
but you couldn't
because you weren't in control.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.224
Your body decided
that it had to survive.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.229
And now your soul's stuck
picking up the pieces.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.407
Right?

23:30.844 --> 23:32.889
I'm telling you
you can't blame yourself.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.630
No good comes of it.

23:34.674 --> 23:38.939
All you can try to do is atone.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.160
How do I do that?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.818
By telling her the truth.

23:51.691 --> 23:55.042
Come on, come on. God.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.697
I'm not feeling any resistance.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.786
BP down 60 over palp.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.918
It's got to be
in here somewhere.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.399
Dr. Reynolds,
we're losing her.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.752
The shard, It's cut
its way out of the bowel.

24:09.796 --> 24:10.840
It's in her abdomen.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.712
HR, 78 BPM.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.931
Dr. Reynolds,
use the forceps.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.455
I've got to be able
to feel the glass.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.543
It could cut your glove.

24:17.586 --> 24:18.935
Come on.
Where are you?

24:18.979 --> 24:21.285
Up on the monitor.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.811
Where are you?

24:31.948 --> 24:33.689
One minute,
you're Mr. By-The-Book,

24:33.733 --> 24:34.690
the next,
you're "Indiana Jones",

24:34.734 --> 24:35.822
just going at it on your own.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.911
Yeah, well,
I should have waited.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.826
Maybe she's alive
because you didn't.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.007
All right, let's repair
the bowel and close her up.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.053
Whew.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.719
- Yes, can I help you?
- I really hope so.

25:03.763 --> 25:04.981
I'm Max Goodwin,
medical director

25:05.025 --> 25:07.157
of New Amsterdam Hospital
in New York City.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.855
This is Dr. Wilder,
the chair of hematology,

25:08.898 --> 25:11.858
and we are here because we are
trying to save a man's life,

25:11.901 --> 25:13.468
and we are running out of time.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.297
Is there someone in this home
with Rh-null blood type?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.604
How did you get this address?

25:18.647 --> 25:20.954
Uh...

25:20.997 --> 25:25.132
Well, um, we stole it

25:25.175 --> 25:27.482
from the donor registry
at the blood bank.

25:27.526 --> 25:31.965
Uh, wow.
OK, yeah, we did do that.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.880
But does that person live here?

25:33.923 --> 25:36.273
If you stole it,
you know they do.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.580
- Can we speak to that person?
- No.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.147
No, you can't.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.410
Showing up to someone's house
to demand their blood is--

25:42.453 --> 25:43.629
I don't even have
a word for it.

25:43.672 --> 25:44.978
You're doctors.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.632
Yes, we are,
which is why we're trying

25:46.675 --> 25:48.503
to save our patient's life
the only way we know how,

25:48.547 --> 25:50.418
and that is to bring the donor
back to New York with us

25:50.461 --> 25:53.029
in one hour where they can
donate their blood in person.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.901
Please leave.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.772
Respectfully,
we can't do that.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.121
We need to speak to the donor.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.214
The donor
doesn't need to talk to you.

26:04.258 --> 26:07.435
All they do is give and give
to doctors, to scientists,

26:07.478 --> 26:09.002
to anyone who begs them
for their blood,

26:09.045 --> 26:11.221
even when there's
none left to give,

26:11.265 --> 26:13.180
even when they turn yellow
from anemia,

26:13.223 --> 26:14.616
even when they need
their family

26:14.660 --> 26:16.009
to carry them to bed
because they're too weak

26:16.052 --> 26:18.794
to make it up the stairs.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.188
Today, their daughter
is giving birth,

26:21.231 --> 26:23.233
and I'm not
gonna let them miss it.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.933
For once, they're gonna get
to be just like everyone else.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.066
But they are not
like everyone else.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.502
They're special.

26:31.546 --> 26:34.549
They can save lives
that nobody else can save.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.987
What is a better legacy
to bestow on a child than that?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.904
Don't come back here.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.254
Ma'am, please, if we--

26:53.960 --> 26:55.657
Hey, Lily.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.834
My gosh, you gave us all
quite the scare earlier.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.402
But you know, we got your meds
right in the sweet spot now.

27:01.445 --> 27:04.579
Everything's looking good.
How are you feeling?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.190
You--you hurt anywhere?
You OK?

27:09.671 --> 27:12.065
You know, no one
is gonna make you talk.

27:12.108 --> 27:13.893
I promise you that,

27:13.936 --> 27:17.070
but if you want to,
I'm here, OK?

27:17.113 --> 27:19.942
No rush,
no pressure whatsoever.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.552
In fact, I'm low-key
kind of psyched,

27:21.596 --> 27:24.033
because that means I get to do
with you what I never

27:24.077 --> 27:25.905
get to do with my patients.

27:25.948 --> 27:28.081
I get to talk. Yes.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.952
Lucky you.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.259
Dr. Frome is in the building.

27:32.302 --> 27:34.827
You know, your day today
in a lot of ways

27:34.870 --> 27:37.612
reminded me of my own wedding,
believe it or not.

27:37.656 --> 27:42.095
So I decided to bring along
these bad boys to show you.

27:42.138 --> 27:45.838
Look at this.
See?

27:45.881 --> 27:49.058
Two grooms, me and my husband.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.800
I know, he's very handsome,
isn't he?

27:51.844 --> 27:55.586
We had an officiant
who was an ordained priest

27:55.630 --> 27:58.807
but also a stand-up comedian,
so that was a lot.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.330
And--oh, my niece.

28:00.374 --> 28:01.941
My niece was the flower girl.

28:01.984 --> 28:05.161
And what's fun about her is
that during my father-in-law's

28:05.205 --> 28:08.295
lovely toast, she decided
to tackle the ring bearer,

28:08.338 --> 28:11.428
grab the ring,
and try to eat it.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.648
She's four.
It's not her fault.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.781
But I would say that,
all in all,

28:15.824 --> 28:18.653
if I had to choose one word
to describe that day,

28:18.697 --> 28:22.701
it would be beautiful.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.311
It was a beautiful day.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.619
What about you?

28:28.663 --> 28:31.666
If you had
to describe the wedding

28:31.710 --> 28:33.755
that you were at today
in one word,

28:33.799 --> 28:35.714
what would that word be?

28:38.629 --> 28:41.720
Well, I wasn't there,
but I would go

28:41.763 --> 28:44.026
with something like scary?

28:46.115 --> 28:48.509
You know, your mom told me
the fire was not an accident,

28:48.552 --> 28:50.990
and I don't think there's
anything scarier

28:51.033 --> 28:52.469
than seeing somebody
do something bad.

28:52.513 --> 28:56.299
You know these scared feelings
you have?

28:56.343 --> 28:58.040
They're tricky because
they don't--they don't go away

28:58.084 --> 29:00.129
unless you talk about them.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.522
And it's totally OK
if you don't

29:01.565 --> 29:02.610
have the words to tell me.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.177
You know,
that's why I brought this.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.527
I find that it's helpful
if you make the story

29:06.570 --> 29:09.399
about them and not about you.

29:09.443 --> 29:13.142
All right, so why don't we--
why don't we start easy, OK?

29:13.186 --> 29:14.622
Why don't you show me

29:14.665 --> 29:18.757
where the bride
and the groom were?

29:22.630 --> 29:24.240
Can you do that?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.991
Nice.
OK.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.210
Good.

29:39.081 --> 29:41.562
Good, very good.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.693
All right.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.043
Let's keep this party
rolling here.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.567
What about the flower girl
and the ring bearer?

29:46.610 --> 29:49.875
Where were they?
Can you do the same thing?

29:49.918 --> 29:52.094
Show me where they were.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.618
Thank you.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.668
Yes, good.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.236
So good, so good.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.979
Where was the person
who started the fire?

30:07.022 --> 30:08.894
Where were they?

30:21.950 --> 30:23.691
Do you know them?

30:35.050 --> 30:37.183
Oh, a mask?

30:37.226 --> 30:38.401
They were wearing a mask?

30:38.445 --> 30:40.012
OK.
All right.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.623
So a--
a man wearing a full mask

30:42.666 --> 30:45.321
standing next to the bride
started the fire on purpose.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.803
That's good.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.545
Lily, that's really good.

30:51.588 --> 30:53.112
Thank you.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.417
You know,
I know today was scary,

30:54.461 --> 30:56.680
but you are by far
the bravest flower girl

30:56.724 --> 30:57.768
I have ever met.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.686
Yeah, I know what I know.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.136
Yeah.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.971
Is he OK?

31:28.712 --> 31:31.150
Who?

31:31.193 --> 31:32.847
My husband.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.596
It's the hospital.

31:42.639 --> 31:45.164
I'll let them know. Hey.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.083
Wait, wait.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.913
What about CPS?

32:00.179 --> 32:03.660
No, no, no, just--just
lock down the whole hospital

32:03.704 --> 32:07.403
until the police get there, OK?
Yeah.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.320
What's wrong?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.326
Tell me.

32:19.198 --> 32:22.636
The groom, the man
that we've been flying

32:22.679 --> 32:23.811
between countries to save,

32:23.854 --> 32:25.465
he was about to marry
a little girl.

32:29.512 --> 32:32.646
It was a child wedding.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.133
Dr. Goodwin?

32:44.005 --> 32:45.789
Did the donor
change their mind?

32:45.833 --> 32:47.704
Yes, I did.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.186
I wouldn't be able
to look at my granddaughter

32:51.230 --> 32:54.189
knowing that someone died
because I didn't help them.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.997
<i>I don't-- I don't get it.</i>

33:20.476 --> 33:23.392
I mean, we've all treated
bad people before.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.222
<i>This time
just feels different.</i>

33:30.095 --> 33:32.184
<i>Different is
an understatement.</i>

33:35.187 --> 33:38.190
<i>I feel like
I need 10 showers.</i>

33:38.233 --> 33:40.061
I mean,
I've treated murderers

33:40.105 --> 33:42.585
and straight-up killers.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.544
I shouldn't feel like this.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.422
<i>So why do we?</i>

33:57.122 --> 33:58.862
Because it was all of them.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.473
It wasn't just
the mother or the groom.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.824
It was every one of those
patients supported this.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.702
So...

34:12.746 --> 34:17.446
It turns out it wasn't a fire.
It was a smoke bomb.

34:17.490 --> 34:21.276
Lily's older brother,
who was only 15 himself,

34:21.320 --> 34:22.973
he wasn't trying
to hurt anybody.

34:23.017 --> 34:25.411
He was just--he was trying
to save his sister.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.935
Yeah, well, at least
there's one sane person

34:27.978 --> 34:29.589
in that poor girl's family.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.026
The police should lock up
every last one of those people

34:32.070 --> 34:33.506
and lose the key.

34:35.508 --> 34:36.987
Yeah.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.600
Nobody's getting arrested.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.689
What?

34:42.732 --> 34:44.778
Because there's
no federal law

34:44.821 --> 34:46.910
against child marriage
in this country.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.217
That's why.

34:49.261 --> 34:52.090
Because it only became illegal
in New York last year,

34:52.133 --> 34:55.005
so Lily's mother
drove up to West Virginia

34:55.049 --> 34:58.313
and got herself
a 100% legal marriage license.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.535
In some of these states,
they could have married her off

35:02.578 --> 35:04.145
when she was five.

35:06.582 --> 35:09.933
Right, so nobody is
gonna get punished for this.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.936
Just Lily.

You know what?
Me first.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.360
Look, I'm sorry
for how I acted this morning.

36:28.403 --> 36:32.190
It's--I mean,
it's complicated, right?

36:32.233 --> 36:33.713
We're--we're complicated,

36:33.756 --> 36:37.630
but I really appreciate
that you're trying

36:37.673 --> 36:38.892
to make up for stuff, and I--

36:38.935 --> 36:42.025
I love that we're...

36:42.069 --> 36:44.463
you know, bonding.

36:44.506 --> 36:47.030
Or, I don't know,
whatever this is.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.468
So...

36:49.511 --> 36:50.817
Me too, Ness.

So, sorry, you--you wanted
to tell me something.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.436
It was just that I love you.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.312
Uh, you know what?

37:11.968 --> 37:15.450
To the Bloom sisters.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.329
Barely functional,
but a ton of fun.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.725
All right, cheers.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.164
Ah.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.308
May I come in?

37:47.352 --> 37:50.485
I don't remember us
making any plans.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.625
Uh, Dad.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.195
I got to say something
that's gonna be hard to hear.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.333
I think you may be bipolar.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.857
Bipolar?

38:14.901 --> 38:16.772
Yes, and I think
that you've been living

38:16.816 --> 38:19.253
with it for most of your life.

38:21.386 --> 38:25.825
So all the times
you made choices that, uh,

38:25.868 --> 38:28.784
caused you to...

38:28.828 --> 38:32.135
lose things, I--

38:32.179 --> 38:33.789
I think this is--

38:33.833 --> 38:35.269
I think this is why.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.322
So this bipolar,

38:44.365 --> 38:46.411
this is
a real medical condition?

38:46.454 --> 38:48.151
Yes.

38:49.805 --> 38:52.025
So all the stuff
I did to you, your mama,

38:52.068 --> 38:54.375
to your sisters--

38:54.419 --> 38:56.334
It's not your fault.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.338
It's not my fault?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.515
No, Dad.

39:03.558 --> 39:06.300
Everybody been making me out
to be the bad guy,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.563
but I'm just a sick man?

39:08.607 --> 39:10.391
That's right.

39:10.435 --> 39:14.134
So I'm gonna need you
to come in to New Amsterdam

39:14.177 --> 39:16.484
tomorrow, OK?
- For what?

39:16.528 --> 39:18.878
Oh, for testing,
and so we can come up

39:18.921 --> 39:20.488
with a plan for treatment.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.838
I don't want
to do any of that,

39:22.882 --> 39:25.319
but I do think your mama
owes me an apology.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.974
Your sisters too.
- What?

39:28.017 --> 39:29.367
I'm not
all those names

39:29.410 --> 39:30.890
they've been calling me
for years.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.545
None of it is my fault.
I couldn't control none of it.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.417
I'm sick!
I got a condition.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.247
I got to make some calls!
