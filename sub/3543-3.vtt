You left out the part about blowing up
a hospital with patients who are sick.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.571
And fragile. And who don't need things
exploding down the hall.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.942
It was contained. Nobody got hurt.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.492
Come on, buy me a farewell drink.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.414
Talk about what the hell Klaus meant
by "The Five."

35:59.574 --> 36:01.784
You know you're not going anywhere,
Damon.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.871
And I am not your new partner
in vampire crime.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.083
Fix things with Stefan and Elena.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.666
Don't let your pride leave you all alone.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.604
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.020
Thanks for coming.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.783
Not every day you get summoned
by a Salvatore. Heh.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.243
So, what's up?

36:37.403 --> 36:38.783
[SIGHS]

36:40.489 --> 36:43.029
Do you remember what you were like
before you turned?

36:43.993 --> 36:47.003
Mm, you mean, an insecure control freak?

36:47.163 --> 36:48.913
Yeah.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.630
You grew into yourself
when you became a vampire.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.836
You changed.

36:56.505 --> 36:59.965
And Elena, she's changing too.

37:00.676 --> 37:04.466
And I want her to be able to enjoy it
without all the guilt and shame...

37:04.639 --> 37:06.009
...that I went through.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.850
And there was a moment today
when she did.

37:11.562 --> 37:15.362
And when I'm with her,
every bone in my body...

37:15.524 --> 37:17.574
...tells me to join her.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.735
To enjoy it.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.535
But I know that if I do...

37:28.704 --> 37:31.164
...even a little...

37:32.667 --> 37:34.167
...I risk becoming him.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.378
The Ripper.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.215
[CHUCKLES]

37:43.219 --> 37:44.759
I love her.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.601
And I don't want to hold her back.

37:48.557 --> 37:51.887
But you don't know how to be around her
and still resist that urge.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.777
Damon promised he'd help me
stay off the edge, but, uh...

38:00.987 --> 38:03.737
...he and I,
we're not in a very good place right now.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.116
Not when it comes to her.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.037
I just thought...

38:09.620 --> 38:14.000
...you're so good at it.
At being a vampire.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.294
[CHUCKLES]

38:16.919 --> 38:20.419
Because of you, Stefan.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.719
I'm good at it because of you.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.512
Come to me.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.431
Whenever you want.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.229
I won't let you lose control.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.727
Elena, hey.

38:40.901 --> 38:44.111
If I'd known you were at the party, I never
would have told Connor about Rebekah.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.870
I had this conversation with Jeremy.
There's no way you guys could have known.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.784
I mean, I was surprised that I went.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.831
Stefan warned me that I would feel things
more powerfully...

38:58.336 --> 39:01.296
...but, Matt, the hatred I felt today...

39:01.464 --> 39:03.634
...I almost...

39:03.799 --> 39:04.839
I almost killed her.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.471
In front of everyone
in the middle of a party.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.599
That's not me.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.983
Or at least it didn't used to be.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.643
Honestly, Elena,
Rebekah kind of deserves it.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.652
Yeah, but it's not just about Rebekah.
It's about my mind.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.783
I'm having these terrible thoughts...

39:24.945 --> 39:29.025
...these violent images, and I...

39:29.200 --> 39:33.120
It's all driven by one simple thing.

39:33.287 --> 39:36.367
This hunger.

39:44.006 --> 39:47.336
Hey, Elena.
You sure you wanna take that much?

39:50.471 --> 39:52.221
Elena.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.723
Elena, that hurts. Elena.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.392
Elena. Elena!

39:57.728 --> 39:59.688
Elena! Elena!

40:02.024 --> 40:05.694
Stop.

40:11.617 --> 40:15.367
Oh, my God. Matt, I'm sorry.
I'm so...

40:15.538 --> 40:18.708
I'm so sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.379
It's okay. Forget what just happened.

40:24.547 --> 40:28.377
You came over, she fed a little bit,
and you left. Now go home.

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

40:32.721 --> 40:35.221
- What have I done?
- Nothing you should be ashamed of.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.352
You are a vampire now.

40:40.062 --> 40:43.062
You just have to learn the right way
to be one.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.862
And I'm gonna teach you.

[GRUNTS]

41:15.931 --> 41:17.681
- You saved me?
- Congratulations.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.270
You just became worth more
to me alive than dead.

41:23.731 --> 41:24.771
What...?

41:24.940 --> 41:28.400
What did you mean when you said
I was one of The Five?

41:32.781 --> 41:35.451
You don't know your own history?

41:42.458 --> 41:44.248
Well, let's just say it's made you...
