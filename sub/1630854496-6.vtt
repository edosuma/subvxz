WEBVTT

00:14.931 --> 00:16.850
- Heidi. Heidi.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.435
[birds chirping]

00:18.476 --> 00:20.687
[tranquil harp music]

00:20.729 --> 00:22.605
- Bumper Allen.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.024
* *

00:24.065 --> 00:27.027
[heartbeat pumping]

00:27.068 --> 00:29.612
[tense music]

00:29.654 --> 00:32.032
You are being deported
by the German government.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.867
* *

00:33.908 --> 00:35.201
[heartbeat quickens]

00:35.243 --> 00:36.828
[high-pitched tone]

00:36.870 --> 00:38.079
- Ahh!

00:38.997 --> 00:40.123
You guys are all here.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.875
I had a nightmare
about being deported.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.168
- It wasn't a nightmare.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.627
You were having a recap.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.883
This is your official
Abschiebungsbefehl.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.801
- Obviously, it is totally,

00:51.843 --> 00:53.720
but you should probably
explain it for Heidi.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.181
- It's your official
deportation notice.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.142
It says you have to leave
the country in six hours.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.102
Also, happy German Unity Day.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.520
- How did this even happen?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.230
- You didn't apply
for your work visa.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.691
- Not to ladle
another turd dumpling

01:06.733 --> 01:07.942
into the crap soup,

01:07.984 --> 01:10.028
but this means
you can't perform at Unity Day

01:10.070 --> 01:12.405
since it's after
the deportation deadline.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.199
If you try,
you will get arrested.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.076
- I was getting used
to a routine.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.535
Heidi buys pastries,

01:17.577 --> 01:19.412
Pieter whines
that you are his only hope,

01:19.454 --> 01:20.914
we prod you
to be a better person,

01:20.955 --> 01:23.124
and we have fun in the process.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.168
- No.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.586
The old Bumper would be crying

01:26.628 --> 01:28.129
in a clean dumpster right now,

01:28.171 --> 01:30.090
but I am not turning myself in.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.467
I am getting my moment
in the spotlight.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.719
I wanna take it all in
and wonder,

01:34.761 --> 01:36.763
can a spotlight
give you a sunburn?

01:36.805 --> 01:39.265
How does light work?

01:39.307 --> 01:40.433
It doesn't matter.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.935
We gotta get creative
right now,

01:41.976 --> 01:43.353
figure out a "solush."

01:43.395 --> 01:44.729
Because I'm not leaving
without a fight.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.440
- Maybe--
maybe we could just explain

01:47.482 --> 01:49.275
our situation and ask
for a visa extension

01:49.317 --> 01:50.985
at the Rathaus.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.904
- Yes, Heidi, the Rathaus.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
The Rathaus?
Okay.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.408
Well, this will be easy.
Chuck E. Cheese is a friend.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.742
- Oh, you're right.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.744
We should all give it
one more try.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.371
- Well, we don't have
that much time.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.915
You have a costume fitting
in an hour,

02:03.957 --> 02:05.625
so let's see what we can do.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.211
And in the meantime, let's keep
all of this information quiet.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.463
- Okay. Let's go.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.465
Also, maybe we
shouldn't tell anyone

02:12.507 --> 02:15.301
that I sleep in my pants
and my shoes like a fireman.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.138
[upbeat spacey music]

02:18.179 --> 02:24.644
* *

02:26.021 --> 02:27.147
- Why are we nervous?

02:27.188 --> 02:28.273
It's our dad.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.441
He can't still be mad at us.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.735
Just--just be cool.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.986
- Oh, scoot over.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.821
You know how much he enjoys
negative space.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.990
- Right, because it reflects
the emptiness...

02:37.032 --> 02:38.491
both: Of the human soul.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.410
- Good call.
- Thank you.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.496
[line ringing]

02:45.248 --> 02:46.458
- Klaus!
- Hi there!

02:46.499 --> 02:48.626
- My man.
- You big guy.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.462
- What is the meaning
of this call?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.047
You're disturbing me.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.673
- Okay. We'll make it quick.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.842
My client, Bumper,
whom you may remember,

02:55.884 --> 02:58.595
is, unfortunately, being
threatened with deportation.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.347
- Can you make some calls?

03:00.388 --> 03:02.682
You have friends
in the government, right?

03:02.724 --> 03:05.685
- Of course I have friends
in the government.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.105
Who do you think
tipped them off?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.691
- Wait,
you got Bumper deported?

03:11.733 --> 03:16.613
- After Bumper made me angry
walking off my set,

03:16.654 --> 03:18.990
I vowed to get back at him,

03:19.032 --> 03:22.285
and there is nothing
my children can do.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.953
Nothing.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.582
How do--how do I get off?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.167
I don't want to be here.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.418
[phone clicks]

03:31.503 --> 03:33.922
- God. He really is a dick.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.553
- Hello.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.222
This is Bumper Allen,
and he would like

03:42.263 --> 03:44.391
to apply for a visa extension.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.975
- I really want to help you.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.310
- Okay. Then do.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.062
- But if you're beyond
your 90 days,

03:49.104 --> 03:50.522
my hands are tied.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.901
In Germany, paperwork is king,
and I'm but a loyal serf.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.236
Except on the weekends,

03:56.277 --> 03:58.822
then it's just Hilda
being Hilda.

03:58.863 --> 04:02.117
- There's nothing you can do?
Are you serious?

04:02.158 --> 04:03.535
- I'm German.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.286
Of course I'm serious.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.792
- I can't believe this might be
my last day in Berlin.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.420
I freaking love this place.

04:13.461 --> 04:18.216
The parks,
the high-calorie street food.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.136
Most of all, I love that it
made me my favorite version

04:21.177 --> 04:22.595
of myself by far.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.265
- I don't want you to go.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.349
Since you got here,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.852
my world has been
a lot brighter.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.770
The hell are you gonna
do back in America, huh?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.273
Just go off and be friends
with people named

04:33.314 --> 04:35.859
Brittany or Luke or something?
[scoffs]

04:35.900 --> 04:36.943
Stupid.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.486
- I am so sorry.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.864
I messed everything up.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.198
- Don't apologize.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.992
You didn't mess anything up.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.453
You know, watching you has

04:46.494 --> 04:50.373
made me want
to get out of my own way

04:50.415 --> 04:52.584
so I can be up there someday.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.128
Being around you has taught
me to be brave enough

04:55.170 --> 04:57.339
to step into my own shoes.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.885
What do you say,
for old time's sake?

05:01.926 --> 05:03.386
- I mean, of course.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.805
- Sit next to me.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.015
Oh.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.184
This might be the last time
our butts touch.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.686
- That is so sad.
- Hmm.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.564
- So what should we sing?

05:14.606 --> 05:19.152
- "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"
or "Walking on Sunshine,'

05:19.194 --> 05:21.905
but we scream "not"
at the start of every chorus.

05:21.946 --> 05:25.158
- If you are leaving here
a broken dreamer,

05:25.200 --> 05:27.702
I have just the song.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.830
[playing "Don't Fall in Love
with a Dreamer"]

05:30.872 --> 05:34.334
* *

05:34.376 --> 05:37.837
* Just look at you *

05:37.879 --> 05:39.172
* *

05:39.214 --> 05:42.175
* Sitting there *

05:42.217 --> 05:45.637
* You never looked
better than tonight *

05:45.679 --> 05:46.763
- I actually don't
know the words.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.767
* And it'd be so easy *

05:50.809 --> 05:54.312
* To tell you I'd stay *

05:54.354 --> 05:59.859
* Like I've done
so many times *

05:59.901 --> 06:05.573
both: * Don't fall in love
with a dreamer *

06:05.615 --> 06:11.162
* 'Cause he'll always
take you in *

06:11.204 --> 06:18.211
* Just when you think
you've really changed him *

06:18.253 --> 06:23.633
* He'll leave you again *

06:23.675 --> 06:29.514
* Don't fall in love
with a dreamer *

06:29.556 --> 06:35.186
* 'Cause he'll break
you every time *

06:35.228 --> 06:36.604
* *

06:36.646 --> 06:39.649
- * Oh, put out the light *

06:39.691 --> 06:42.318
- * Just hold on *

06:42.360 --> 06:48.450
both: * Before we say goodbye *

06:48.491 --> 06:53.788
* *

06:55.623 --> 06:58.835
[applause]

07:00.045 --> 07:01.129
- Thank you.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.131
- Obviously,
all the romantic stuff

07:03.173 --> 07:04.758
was just written by Kenny.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.802
- Was there romantic stuff
in that song?

07:07.844 --> 07:12.474
I just thought it was
about doors and lights...

07:12.515 --> 07:13.850
and stuff.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.022
- Hey, get away from my piano.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.190
- Okay.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.608
- If you don't want us
to play the piano,

07:21.649 --> 07:23.401
just don't leave the piano.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.111
- Is that even his piano?

07:25.153 --> 07:28.114
- [whispering] I hope Pieter
and Thea had more success.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.410
- Great. You're here.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.412
Well, try some costume options.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.831
The Unity Day committee over
there will approve the look,

07:36.873 --> 07:38.708
and we will be off
to the races.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.251
Assume the position, please.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.253
- Okay.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.922
[loud bang]

07:46.091 --> 07:48.134
- Well, you don't need
to stand like that.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.386
- Oh.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.179
It must mean something
different in America.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.348
- I'm sorry we're late.
Okay.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.474
We got a big failure.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.309
We totally botched the--
- Pieter.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.478
This is the Unity Day costumer.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.315
And over there are the members
of the Unity Day committee.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.067
- Of course.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.570
Oh, we are excited
to get Bumper dressed up

08:07.612 --> 08:08.988
for a big event

08:09.030 --> 08:11.825
with absolutely no other
complications whatsoever.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.660
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.537
- [through teeth]
Any luck at the Rathaus?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.205
- No.
And what are you doing?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.665
- I'm smiling.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.875
- So any luck with Klaus?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.377
- No. In fact, he's the one

08:22.419 --> 08:24.587
that got the government
to boil your spaetzle.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.173
- D'oh! Klaus!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.466
Also, what is a spaetzle?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.843
- Oh, it's a homemade noodle.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.886
- I'm gonna call Klaus back
and tell him off.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.930
And, oh, my face hurts.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.017
It must be exhausting
to be a nice person or a wolf.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.979
- Well, well, well, if it isn't
so many blueberry muffins

08:41.021 --> 08:42.689
stealing half of my spotlight.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.982
What next?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.233
You're going to steal
my Unity Day look?

08:45.275 --> 08:48.361
- I hope not because
I can't pull off white.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.030
It washes me out.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.740
- Gisela, excuse us a minute.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.575
- Oh, no problem.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.745
I'll just cease to exist
for 60 seconds.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.163
both: Okay.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.667
- We need to talk.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.752
- You have been doing squats.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.462
- Several thousand a day. Yes.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.588
- I think I know
how to save you

09:06.629 --> 09:08.381
from being deported.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.549
- What?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.551
- You have to marry Thea.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.595
[tense music]

09:20.268 --> 09:22.103
- Marry Thea?

09:22.145 --> 09:25.315
- Seeing Gisela's white dress,
it just clicked.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.109
If you marry a citizen,
you can stay in the country.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.152
- Okay.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.780
I don't know
if you know this or not,

09:31.821 --> 09:33.823
but Thea and I are not in love.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.659
Is this what you want me to do?

09:36.701 --> 09:39.245
- It is if it keeps you
in Germany.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.165
- How long would we have
to pretend to be a couple?

09:42.207 --> 09:45.710
What happens if I fall in love
with somebody else

09:45.752 --> 09:47.128
or I already am?
Never mind.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.963
I mean, would Thea
even go for this?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.132
She once called me
"Mr. Potato Head

09:51.174 --> 09:52.842
if he couldn't grow
that mustache."

09:55.887 --> 09:59.015
- Thea,
do you wanna marry Bumper

09:59.057 --> 10:00.350
so he can stay in the country?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.768
- Sure.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.228
- You'd do this for me
even though we're not in love?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.397

look real

we're committing fraud.

I think Bumper
will make a good husband.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.246
Yeah. He seems like the type
to announce blueberry pancakes,

11:45.288 --> 11:46.956
but then have none
of the ingredients,

11:46.998 --> 11:48.416

as your new brother,

that you love Heidi.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.518
- Do you, Bumper...
- Yes, I do.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.395
- Take Thea...
- Yes.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.522
- To be your
lawfully wedded wife...

19:07.564 --> 19:09.315
- Okay.
- To have and to hold...

19:09.357 --> 19:11.651
- Sure.
- Until death do you part?

19:11.693 --> 19:13.361
- Yes. Okay. Yes.
Fine. Good.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.405
Great.
- And do you, Thea--

19:15.447 --> 19:17.240
- This man is not allowed
to perform.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.783
- [sighs]

19:18.825 --> 19:20.201
- He's with me.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.786
Official Rathaus business.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.914
Now step aside,
or I'll report you

19:24.956 --> 19:27.792
for working on a holiday
without a permit.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.835
[inhales sharply]

19:34.049 --> 19:35.675
- Thank you, Hilda.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.634
Whoo!

19:36.676 --> 19:39.804
[suspenseful music]

19:39.846 --> 19:41.014
* *

19:41.056 --> 19:42.891
- Hey.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.559
Enjoy this.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.811
It's everything
you've always wanted.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.063
- Thanks.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.106
* *

19:50.148 --> 19:51.733
Thank you.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.069
I should get going.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.780
- Hmm.
- Okay.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.281
Thea. Hilda.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.657
- I don't want to brag,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.201
but I still fit
into the same size

20:01.242 --> 20:03.995
giant high-heel prop shoes
that I wore in high school.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.747
- Thank you, honey.

20:05.789 --> 20:06.915
Okay.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.126
So now, Thea,
do you take Bumper

20:10.168 --> 20:12.587
to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

20:12.629 --> 20:14.673
to have and to hold
until death do you part?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.591
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay, good.

20:16.633 --> 20:20.595
- So now I pronounce
you husband and wife.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.306
You may now kiss the bride.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.141
- Do we have to?
- No, absolutely not.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.226
Mm-mm.
- No.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.435
- Let's just--

20:27.477 --> 20:30.438
[cheers and applause]

20:30.480 --> 20:33.400
[sentimental music]

20:33.441 --> 20:40.573
* *

20:50.291 --> 20:51.584
- Hello, Berlin!

20:51.626 --> 20:54.087
[cheers and applause]

20:54.129 --> 20:56.089
Wow, this is--

20:56.131 --> 20:58.341
this is such an honor.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.926
But I don't really know
what to say.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.553
So I'll just sing.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.599
* Staring at the ceiling *

21:06.641 --> 21:09.477
* Laying wide awake *

21:09.519 --> 21:12.647
* In a city of strangers *

21:12.689 --> 21:15.316
* Who don't know my name *

21:21.364 --> 21:23.825
You know what?
I do know what to say.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.455
[sentimental music]

21:28.496 --> 21:30.123
I thought the most
important thing in the world

21:30.165 --> 21:32.876
was being a star,

21:32.917 --> 21:36.963
the one famous person
who can outshine

21:37.005 --> 21:41.092
everyone else
in every room he steps in

21:41.134 --> 21:44.387
and every stage he steps on.

21:44.429 --> 21:48.683
There's no such thing
as just one star,

21:48.725 --> 21:52.479
'cause every star is...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.981
part of a constellation.

21:55.023 --> 21:59.277
* *

21:59.319 --> 22:05.408
So in the spirit
of constellations,

22:05.450 --> 22:07.160
I wanna give you
a little treat.

22:07.202 --> 22:11.164
There is somebody who deserves
to be up here...

22:11.206 --> 22:13.375
more than I do.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.668
I mean, don't get me wrong.

22:14.709 --> 22:18.838
I fought tooth and nail
to get on this stage,

22:18.880 --> 22:25.512
but this person
is a beautiful artist,

22:25.553 --> 22:28.223
an amazing friend,

22:28.264 --> 22:29.474
and I love her.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.226
* *

22:31.267 --> 22:35.271
And I know you will, too,
because it's her turn to shine.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.191
She is gonna sing
instead of me.

22:38.233 --> 22:43.488
* *

22:43.530 --> 22:45.156
It's what she's always wanted.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.951
It seems like she needs

22:47.992 --> 22:49.828
a little convincing
to get up here,

22:49.869 --> 22:53.415
so I'm gonna need your help,
okay?

22:53.456 --> 22:55.375
When I sing,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.961
* Come and sing *

22:58.003 --> 22:59.170
You sing,

22:59.212 --> 23:00.630
* Heidi *

23:00.672 --> 23:02.048
Can we do that?

23:02.090 --> 23:03.383
all: Yes.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.052
- * Come and sing *

23:06.094 --> 23:07.804
all: * Heidi *

23:07.846 --> 23:10.265
- * Come and sing *

23:10.306 --> 23:11.558
all: * Heidi *

23:11.599 --> 23:14.394
- * Come and sing *

23:14.436 --> 23:15.895
- The last time
I heard a crowd

23:15.937 --> 23:17.439
chanting a name
this powerfully,

23:17.480 --> 23:19.232
I was kicked out
of my own hometown

23:19.274 --> 23:22.027
for being a witch.
- * Come and sing *

23:22.068 --> 23:23.695
crowd: * Heidi *

23:25.405 --> 23:28.491
[cheers and applause]

23:31.161 --> 23:32.912
- You are unbelievable.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.664
- You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.167
- I told you earlier.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.418
I'm ready.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.253
- I knew you wanted to.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.421
Have fun.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.549
[cheers and applause]

23:48.428 --> 23:51.222

23:56.561 --> 23:59.189
* Who don't know my name *

23:59.230 --> 24:01.900
* Everyone's trying
to make it *

24:01.941 --> 24:04.527
* Trying to leave something *

24:04.569 --> 24:07.489
* That says I was here
for a minute, for a minute *

24:07.530 --> 24:09.491
* And I did my thing *

24:09.532 --> 24:11.868
* It's all in my head *

24:11.910 --> 24:14.454
* It's all in my heart *

24:14.496 --> 24:19.751
* The light always finds a way
to shine through the dark *

24:19.793 --> 24:24.673
* It's way too late now
for turning around *

24:24.714 --> 24:29.803
* I'm right at the edge,
but I'ma figure it out *

24:29.844 --> 24:31.388
* But they don't know my name *

24:31.429 --> 24:33.640
- * Turn, turning
into something *

24:33.682 --> 24:36.059
* Different than before *

24:36.101 --> 24:40.313
* 'Cause every turn I'm turning
takes me to your door *

24:40.355 --> 24:43.108
- * They don't know my name *
- * And far and away *

24:43.149 --> 24:50.031
both: * Doesn't feel so far *

24:50.073 --> 24:53.660
- * One day I'm gonna
make it out this room *

24:53.702 --> 24:55.995
* I don't have nothing
to lose *

24:56.037 --> 25:00.125
* I'll be patient 'cause I know
it's on the way *

25:00.166 --> 25:01.668
* But they don't know my name *

25:01.710 --> 25:04.671
- * But if home's wherever
you are *

25:04.713 --> 25:06.172
- * Wherever you are *

25:23.398 --> 25:25.900
- Thank you so much, Berlin!

25:25.942 --> 25:29.863
This is Heidi Miller,
the amazing singer-songwriter.

25:29.904 --> 25:34.117
And this is DJ Das Boot,
the hottest music producer.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.578
And of course,
ladies and gentlemen,

25:36.619 --> 25:38.663
my good friend and manager--

25:38.705 --> 25:41.374
I wouldn't be here
without him--

25:41.416 --> 25:42.709
Pieter Kramer.

25:42.751 --> 25:44.794
[applause dies]

25:46.588 --> 25:48.882
- And he is very sorry
for everything

25:48.923 --> 25:50.717
he put Germany through.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.094
It will never happen again.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.721
Pieter the cheater

25:54.763 --> 25:56.765
is now Pieter the kilometer,

25:56.806 --> 25:59.768
because that is how big
his apology is.

26:02.687 --> 26:05.482

26:08.485 --> 26:15.617

26:32.967 --> 26:34.969
- Oh, my God.
My heart's racing.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.515
- What a show, man.
What a show!

26:38.556 --> 26:40.100
- Can I have your autograph?

26:40.141 --> 26:43.395
- You realize I am not Flea
from the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

26:43.436 --> 26:44.646
- What's next for Bumper Allen?

26:44.688 --> 26:46.272
- Before coming to Germany,

26:46.314 --> 26:48.358
I never thought that this
would be my life,

26:48.400 --> 26:51.069
so I'm not even gonna try
to predict what's next.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.529
- I know what's next for me.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.738
- What?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.448
- I want to make
our partnership official.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.118
I can produce all your clients.

26:58.159 --> 27:00.286
We can call our company
Kramer and Kramer.

27:00.328 --> 27:03.456
- I would be honored
to work with you, DJ Das Boot.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.959
- Newcomer performances
can be a bit wobbly,

27:06.001 --> 27:08.211
but that was so entertaining.

27:08.253 --> 27:10.422
- I couldn't have done it
without my manager,

27:10.463 --> 27:12.465
my producer, my songwriter.

27:12.507 --> 27:13.925
Where's Heidi?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.804
- I don't know.
- Well done.

27:17.846 --> 27:18.805
- I have to go and find Heidi.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.515
Thank you.
- Okay.

27:20.557 --> 27:21.808
Good luck.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.814
- Forgive me, Pieter.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.649
I let you take the fall
for the sound machine,

27:29.691 --> 27:30.859
and you were only
trying to help me.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.902
And...[exhales]

27:32.944 --> 27:35.238
Seeing you up there
throbbing--

27:35.280 --> 27:38.074
I mean, thriving...

27:38.116 --> 27:40.452
it really made me realize
what a mistake I made

27:40.493 --> 27:42.662
putting you out of my life.

And...

27:54.090 --> 27:57.385
we were talking about
how much fun it would be

27:57.427 --> 27:58.887
to get DSM back together.

28:22.577 --> 28:24.079
I'm sorry, Gisela.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.248
But I have a new team now,
and I moved on.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.295
[sentimental music]

28:32.337 --> 28:35.590
- So wanted to touch base
real quick

28:35.632 --> 28:38.551
about everything
that happened...

28:38.593 --> 28:40.720
and was said on stage,

28:40.762 --> 28:43.348
particularly by me...

28:43.390 --> 28:44.891
about you.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.726
- Well, it was life-changing.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.353
I have you to thank.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.230
Sorry I disappeared
back there.

28:50.271 --> 28:54.901
I was just scouted
by a record label based in LA.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.069
They love my song.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.821
- What?
- Yeah. [laughs]

28:57.862 --> 28:59.447
- Heidi, that's huge.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.699
- Yeah.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.410
- Wait, so are--
are you moving to LA?

29:03.451 --> 29:07.580
'Cause that is very,
very far from here, he guessed.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.040
- I don't know.

29:09.082 --> 29:11.084
I mean, it's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

29:11.126 --> 29:15.547
But the question is,
will.i.am or won't.i.am?

29:15.588 --> 29:16.756
- Totally.
I get that.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.174
Believe me.
I've been there.

29:18.216 --> 29:22.762
But did you happen
to "Fergie"--t

29:22.804 --> 29:25.015
about the other stuff I said?

29:26.182 --> 29:30.228
'Cause I can repeat it
if you need me to.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.567
I meant every word of it.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.613
- Bumper.

29:40.655 --> 29:41.865
You better not be thinking

29:41.906 --> 29:43.116
of running away
from our sham marriage.

29:43.158 --> 29:45.035
- Oh, great.
My wife's here.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.287
- Here's a list of rules
for a living in my house.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.122
I'm very particular,
and I've got

29:49.164 --> 29:50.582
something called white mold.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.251
It happens when ham sits
too long on your walls.

29:53.293 --> 29:55.211
- Okay.
I have to move in with you?

29:56.171 --> 29:58.798
- Uh, well, yeah, of course.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.300
You have to stay in Berlin

30:00.342 --> 30:02.886
and sell the marriage,
or else we both

30:02.927 --> 30:04.137
are getting arrested for fraud.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.139
Oh, and my girlfriend Ilse
gets the bed.

30:06.181 --> 30:09.142
You are on
a very hard concrete pullout.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.811
Heidi,
what an epic performance.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.480
I'm so happy for you.

30:13.521 --> 30:14.564
- Thanks.

30:14.606 --> 30:17.233
I'm so happy for both of you.

- There's my constellation.

[laughter]

30:21.321 --> 30:24.908

30:29.788 --> 30:32.624
but I am so grateful
I came here.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.167

30:34.209 --> 30:37.045
