WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:12.303
-Please! You have to listen.
- Move!

00:12.887 --> 00:15.807
You're making a terrible mistake! You--

00:16.016 --> 00:17.475
Let us go right now!

00:19.394 --> 00:21.938
-The Skeksis killed my mother!
-Be silent!

00:22.897 --> 00:24.607
Or I will silence you!

00:24.691 --> 00:26.401
You will never silence me!

00:26.484 --> 00:28.528
-Well...

00:30.405 --> 00:31.531
You two Paladins.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.367
-Your services are no longer required.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.661
Run along back to your new All-Maudra.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.790
These Gelfling here have just the vigor
we're looking for.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.877
-Load them in!
- Turn around!

00:44.294 --> 00:45.962
And their little Podling, too.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.089
- Get in! I won't tell you again!

00:48.173 --> 00:49.049
Move!

00:49.132 --> 00:51.051
- Let us go!
-Gelfling!

00:52.177 --> 00:54.387
Come on! Get in there!

00:54.929 --> 00:57.474
-Silence! Get in!

00:57.807 --> 01:00.518
Go, Gelfling! Stop whining!

01:00.602 --> 01:02.729
Silence!

01:02.812 --> 01:04.314
No!

01:28.296 --> 01:29.964
To the Castle of the Crystal.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.475
- Help!
- Please, my lords. Please!

01:40.725 --> 01:43.436
-Help us! Please, help!
- Don't do this, my lords.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.729
Let us out!

01:44.979 --> 01:46.481
Let us out!

01:59.744 --> 02:00.745
Help us!

02:01.371 --> 02:03.623
-Someone!
- Let us go!

02:04.707 --> 02:06.417
Huh.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.711
The Skeksis have Deet.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.505
And Brea.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.215
We have to do something.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.760
You have no idea what horrible things
the Skeksis will do to them.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.429
We won't abandon anyone. I promise.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.849
-But we'll have to act quickly.
- Let's mount up.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.893
- On your right!
- Follow me!

02:24.018 --> 02:25.395
- Hi-yah!

02:25.562 --> 02:26.604
Watch out!

02:52.630 --> 02:53.464
Hm?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.397
Oh, what's going on?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.608
Help! Someone help!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.276
Where are they taking us?

03:55.860 --> 03:56.903
Please!

03:58.821 --> 04:00.698
Trust the lords.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.580
You must learn
to control your temper, skekVar.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.209
We were sent to collect Gelfling,
not spill blood!

04:11.292 --> 04:12.961
I did what was necessary.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.381
I only hope, for your sake,
the Emperor sees it that way.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.092
-The Emperor is forgiving.
- Of course.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.178
If there's one quality our Emperor
is known for,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.930
it's mercy.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.673
-Why have we stopped?
-Hm...

04:59.340 --> 05:00.258
Huh?

05:00.341 --> 05:01.509
-What's happening?
-<i>Yapa...</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:02.593
Where are we?

05:02.677 --> 05:03.803
Why we not go?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.139
-I don't know. Is something wrong?

05:06.681 --> 05:07.974
- Down!
- Skeksis!

05:11.602 --> 05:12.437
Rian!

05:13.104 --> 05:15.773
- What's going on?
-Rian? Rian is here!

05:16.858 --> 05:18.443
I hear you're looking for me!

05:18.776 --> 05:20.236
Arrogant trifle!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.989
What's the matter?
Too scared to come out and face me?

05:24.782 --> 05:26.284
-Now!
-Go!

05:28.578 --> 05:29.454
Stay low!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.751
- Brea.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.752
-Kylan!
-We're here.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.213
-We're going to get you all out.
-Somehow.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.341
-Huh?
- Please help, please!

06:01.110 --> 06:03.738
What was that? What's happening?
Come on, we need to get on.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.699
Open up!

06:06.783 --> 06:07.784
Move! Look out!

06:12.455 --> 06:14.874
-What are you doing?
-Squashing a pest!

06:17.502 --> 06:19.712
-But we're not moving!
-I know that!

06:25.718 --> 06:26.594
What's it doing?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.224
What is that foul thing?

06:31.307 --> 06:32.600
-Huh?

06:36.020 --> 06:38.940
It's some creature! Get away, fiend.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.945
Let go!

06:49.158 --> 06:51.369
-My carriage!
- Everyone, out!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.914
-This way!
-Come on, let's go! This way.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.666
-Let's go. Go. Don't stop!
-Come on.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.836
-This way!
-This way. Don't look back! Come on.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.713
Don't stop, move it.
That's it. We've gotta go.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.926
- You saved us.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.929
I've never seen such a creature before.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.767
Good day. Uh...

07:16.436 --> 07:17.520
This is Lore.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.772
He's my protector.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.983
Thank you, Lore.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.236
You'll die for this impudence,
you noxious Gelfling!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.117
What are you doing?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.746
-It's coming for us!
-I demand you stop where you are!

07:36.330 --> 07:38.207
Halt! That's far enough!

07:39.876 --> 07:40.877
What shall we do?

07:41.252 --> 07:45.006
-We must escape without delay!
-At long last, you've had a good idea.

07:45.089 --> 07:45.965
Yes.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.891
Cowards!

08:05.276 --> 08:07.278
-Uh...

08:07.904 --> 08:08.863
Hello there.

08:14.035 --> 08:14.869
Rian.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.162
Brea!

08:19.165 --> 08:20.208
Thank you.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.754
You were so brave!

08:25.129 --> 08:26.297
-Uh...

08:29.258 --> 08:31.052
- That's him.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.803
- I think it is.
- It is.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.139
-I'm glad you're safe.
- It is.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.516
-That's Rian.
-He's a killer.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.558
- He's the traitor.
-Huh?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.186
-And a murderer.
-This is all his fault.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.273
-I should go.
-You're not going anywhere.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.651
Enough, Paladins.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.070
We owe our lives to Rian.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.949
He is no more our enemy
than the Skeksis are our friends.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.078
Tell them.

08:57.954 --> 08:58.788
Hm.

09:00.456 --> 09:04.168
Everything the Skeksis ever told us
was a lie.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.962
Huh?

09:06.254 --> 09:10.216
But it's hard to recognize the light when
you've spent your whole life in the dark.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.385
Today...

09:12.718 --> 09:15.304
Today you have glimpsed
the true face of your lords.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.391
Dreamfast with me.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.143
Learn the secrets they keep from you.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.522
Then spread the truth across Thra,

09:25.147 --> 09:28.276
so we may finally unite as one
against our true foe...

09:30.903 --> 09:32.113
the Skeksis.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.666
I will dreamfast with you.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.253
I will dreamfast with you.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.672
- I will dreamfast.
- I will dreamfast.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.549
I will dreamfast.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.925
I will dreamfast with you.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.553
- I will dreamfast.
-I will dreamfast with you.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.987
Our beloved All-Maudra is dead.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.489
Now, as is tradition,

10:16.157 --> 10:19.785
the windsifters will deliver
six pieces of her crown

10:20.077 --> 10:21.662
to six Maudras

10:22.371 --> 10:26.292
that they might come together
to reassemble it

10:26.542 --> 10:29.420
and place it upon the brow
of the new All-Maudra.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.507
♪ <i>Ru Aiki ♪</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:35.176
♪ <i>Ru A'ela ♪</i>

10:35.259 --> 10:38.346
<i>♪ Ru Ada'a Ru ♪</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:44.435
<i>♪ Ru Aiki ♪</i>

10:44.518 --> 10:46.187
<i>♪ Ru A'ela ♪</i>

10:46.395 --> 10:49.565
<i>♪ Ru Ada'a Ru ♪</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:41.617
Gelfling need an All-Maudra
who will not be swayed from the path

11:41.701 --> 11:44.120
set for us by the Lords of the Crystal.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.833
A beacon of light in these dark times.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.339
I shall be that All-Maudra.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.092
Princess Seladon,

11:58.551 --> 12:01.011
your mother must be returned to Thra.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.014
The burial rites must be observed.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.349
There will be no rites.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.060
-But the All-Maudra--
-...was a traitor!

12:08.144 --> 12:10.563
- Now she'll be made an example.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.606
We will burn her.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.610
-For shame!

12:19.238 --> 12:20.656
For Thra.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.261
Gelfling!

12:42.845 --> 12:44.847
Gelfling of Stone-in-Wood!

12:45.723 --> 12:46.640
Hm?

12:47.767 --> 12:51.562
-Huh?
-A Lord of Crystal walks among you.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.231
Bring water! Bring food!

12:54.857 --> 12:57.610
Come out and fetch. Now!

13:01.030 --> 13:01.989
Huh?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.076
What is this? I give orders!

13:06.285 --> 13:07.453
Do as told!

13:07.828 --> 13:10.372
Have you no respect for lords?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.166
Ow!

13:12.416 --> 13:13.834
Who threw peachberry?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.630
Who shows such disrespect?

13:17.713 --> 13:18.631
Ha!

13:18.881 --> 13:21.300
I see you! I see you!

13:22.259 --> 13:25.012
Stonewood warriors, I command. Go!

13:25.179 --> 13:28.265
Find culprit! Punish! Make pay!

13:31.185 --> 13:32.728
You dare blaspheme!

13:34.396 --> 13:36.106
Snarking woibles!

13:38.609 --> 13:40.069
My face!

13:41.070 --> 13:44.114
How could you? I protect Gelfling!

13:44.532 --> 13:45.574
You owe me!

13:46.200 --> 13:47.368
We owe you nothing!

13:48.327 --> 13:50.037
-We know what you did!
-Drainer!

13:51.288 --> 13:52.873
-Drainer!
- Drainer!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.043
- Drainer!
- Drainer!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.295
-Drainer!
-Stop!

13:58.379 --> 13:59.421
- Stop, please.
-Drainer!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.340
- Get out of here!
- So mean!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.176
-Dirty drainer!
- Please!

14:04.260 --> 14:05.553
Drainer!

14:05.636 --> 14:07.680
Back, savages!

14:08.389 --> 14:10.266
-Drainer!
-Oh, stop it!

14:11.600 --> 14:12.434
-Get out!

14:13.060 --> 14:14.144
-Drainer!
-Drainer!

14:14.436 --> 14:16.313
-You're not a lord at all!
-Drainer!

14:18.774 --> 14:19.650
Stop!

14:23.737 --> 14:27.074
The General and the Ritual Master
have returned...

14:27.741 --> 14:30.786
without the promised volunteers.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.667
-The Emperor won't like that.
- No.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.171
-This should be interesting.
-Let's go.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.340
The rest will have gathered by now.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.968
Before they set off
for the Crystal Desert,

14:46.051 --> 14:49.013
the Princess Brea warned us that we were
being taken to the castle to be drained.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.724
-I don't believe it.
-None of us did!

14:51.932 --> 14:54.435
Praise Thra, we were rescued
by two of your fellow guards.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.936
-Oh!
-Rian and Gurjin.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.023
When we dreamfasted,
we saw the truth for ourselves

14:59.106 --> 15:00.983
and vowed to share their story.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.818
Perhaps he speaks the truth.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.614
But Rian has the mind sickness.
The Skeksis look after us Gelfling.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.407
-Yes.
-I cannot dreamfast their memories,

15:08.490 --> 15:11.368
but I know what I saw.
I risked my life to bring you their truth.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.120
The lords executed the All-Maudra!

15:13.203 --> 15:15.497
The General swung the blade
that took her life!

15:15.581 --> 15:18.000
-And your sister in arms... Mira?
-Yes.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.878
She was murdered. But not by Rian!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.213
The Skeksis twisted the Crystal
to drain her essence.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.717
-Those vicious makrats!
-Duplicitous squirms!

15:26.800 --> 15:29.511
-We must rise for our fallen guard!
-Yes! Yes!

15:29.595 --> 15:33.390
Yes! Spread the word and gather arms.
We take this castle this very night!

15:33.474 --> 15:36.143
- Yeah!

15:46.862 --> 15:49.156
We've been walking forever.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.825
Doesn't Lore ever stop to rest?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.953
- Do rocks need to rest?

15:54.078 --> 15:57.247
Well, usually they just lie about.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.666
Well...

15:59.541 --> 16:01.293
not Lore.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.712
Unfortunately not.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.720
Whoa! What a view.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.766
What is that?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.685
The Crystal Desert.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.478
It's beautiful!

16:20.270 --> 16:22.439
They say the sands never stop shifting.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.235
Crossing the desert on foot will be
about as easy as walking on water.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.737
We should set up camp for the night.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.739
-See what solutions the morning offers.
-Yes.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.408
-I'll start a fire.
-Looks like another night

16:32.491 --> 16:34.368
-spent sleeping on the ground.
-Hup? Help me find some wood.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.327
Hup!

16:35.619 --> 16:36.620
Uh...

16:36.787 --> 16:38.872
Must you complain about everything?

16:39.206 --> 16:41.291
It's not my fault
that everything's terrible.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.174
We're not in the Sog anymore.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
I never thought I would miss home...

16:51.635 --> 16:53.262
as much as I do.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.937
-It is beautiful, though, isn't it?
-Yes.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.905
I keep thinking
if I turn my head fast enough,

17:12.948 --> 17:14.783
I'll see my mother's face.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.663
Or if I listen hard enough,

17:20.539 --> 17:21.832
I'll hear her voice.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.252
But I won't.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.173
I'm so sorry, Brea.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.800
Seladon was right. It's all my fault.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.178
I have to go back to Ha'rar.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.264
I can't just leave her like that
on the floor.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.433
Going back now won't help anyone.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.226
I should be there to bury her.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.856
Send her essence back to Thra.
That there are ceremonies.

17:47.191 --> 17:52.321
Well, maybe we could have
our own ceremony right here.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.866
That would help.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.369
-Thank you.
-That's what friends do.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.829
We help.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.127
You're a true friend.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.442
-Longneck! There you are.
-Hm?

18:35.989 --> 18:37.741
Mother Aughra,

18:38.283 --> 18:42.204
I see your eye is open once again.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.707
Yes. I have heard the Song of Thra,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.793
no thanks to your riddles! Hmph!

18:47.876 --> 18:51.880
-Yet you found your answers.
-All but one.

18:51.964 --> 18:52.965
Hm...

18:53.465 --> 18:55.676
How it all ends.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.803
Many pieces on the board,

18:57.886 --> 18:59.638
many possible outcomes.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.143
Aughra must guide all
to bring about the best one.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.602
-Hm!

19:06.228 --> 19:08.230
Like herding Fizzgig.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.316
And where does my path lead?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.861
Into the sands to face the Hunter.

19:18.949 --> 19:19.825
Mm...

19:20.576 --> 19:24.538
I cannot defeat my dark half.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.748
You will find a way.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.960
But not without sacrifice.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.337
And if I fail?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.756
The heroes of Thra will be lost.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.758
Mm...

19:40.387 --> 19:44.308
-I will end the hunt.
- Good.

19:44.600 --> 19:49.146
Get a move on. You Mystics
are not known for your swift speed.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.692
-We have much to do.
-Hm...

19:56.486 --> 19:58.780
And where do you go?

20:00.824 --> 20:02.743
On to Stone-in-the-Wood

20:03.035 --> 20:05.412
to prevent a terrible mistake.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.538
Hm!

20:07.998 --> 20:10.250
Will we meet again, Aughra?

20:13.795 --> 20:14.796
Hm...

20:19.134 --> 20:20.260
Some things...

20:20.636 --> 20:23.972
even Aughra cannot see, old friend.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.203
Life and death are a circle...

20:47.579 --> 20:48.622
not a line.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.875
There is no end,

20:52.542 --> 20:53.585
no beginning.

20:55.045 --> 20:59.758
Today, our beloved All-Maudra
has returned to Thra.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.929
Though we cannot be there
to guide her essence home...

21:05.222 --> 21:08.392
we will sing her memory across the wind.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.065
I will bind your words
into a dream stitch.

21:15.399 --> 21:19.319
All those who find this seed
will know her as you did.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.446
Speak for the dead.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.991
Share your best memory

21:24.616 --> 21:27.661
that we may all know her goodness.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.205
I'm...

21:32.416 --> 21:34.334
Oh, I'm not sure. I...

21:35.502 --> 21:37.170
Did she have a favorite song?

21:38.046 --> 21:40.465
-Favorite joke?
-Food?

21:41.091 --> 21:43.093
Did she have a favorite place?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.805
I-- I, I don't know how to begin.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.896
My father wasn't what you'd call
the affectionate type.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.358
I was a soldier, not a son.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.653
At least that's how it felt.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.531
But when we fought the Hunter...

22:06.742 --> 22:07.826
and the gobbles...

22:08.994 --> 22:10.912
the two of us, side by side...

22:13.248 --> 22:14.958
suddenly I was both.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.588
Every lesson he ever tried to teach me
suddenly fell into place.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.966
His final words were "Be brave."

22:23.842 --> 22:25.218
So that's what I'll do...

22:26.386 --> 22:27.429
for my captain.

22:28.013 --> 22:28.889
Mm.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.265
For my father.

22:32.517 --> 22:36.188
Mother was never shy
about saying "I love you."

22:37.606 --> 22:40.400
Usually before she made me do
something tedious.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.904
“I love you. Get out of bed."

22:43.987 --> 22:46.114
Or "I love you.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.868
Now, go and fetch that report
on crop rotation.”

22:50.911 --> 22:53.663
I thought it was something
all mothers had to say.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.626
But when I looked in her eyes

22:58.710 --> 23:00.379
as her light faded...

23:02.255 --> 23:03.507
I realized...

23:04.341 --> 23:07.219
she meant it every single time.

23:11.181 --> 23:17.562
<i>♪ Tsian oo as ae oo-oo am ♪</i>

23:18.188 --> 23:24.486
<i>♪ Bez a-a-a puy-um tsa ♪</i>

23:25.153 --> 23:30.617

<i>♪ Tso-o-o-am be-na-ub ♪</i>

24:42.022 --> 24:45.108
I loved you with all I had.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.839
I'm sorry it wasn't enough.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.379
-Huh?

25:48.755 --> 25:50.090
Foul treachery!

25:52.467 --> 25:56.096
Treacherous Gelfling!
You'll be drained for this!

25:56.596 --> 26:00.517
- Let me go!
- We'll feast on your essence!

26:01.309 --> 26:02.143
No!

26:02.227 --> 26:05.021
Oh, I do hope you taste better
than you fight.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.940
Please, my lord! Please!

26:07.023 --> 26:08.900
Please!

26:24.207 --> 26:25.917
The windsifters have flown.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.003
I return
with my piece of the Living Crown.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.467
The Stonewood clan rushes to the Vapra
in their time of need.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.723
Maudra Fara.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.398
The Whisper Stream has overflown
since the flight of the windsifters.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.317
Please, tell me true.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.777
How did she die?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.989
My mother refused Skeksis
their volunteers.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.992
-She openly defied them

26:59.951 --> 27:02.037
and paid the price for her insolence.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.497
So the rumors are true.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.585
Your mother was a titan.

27:08.918 --> 27:12.631
She never ran from a fight
and never gave up the high ground.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.924
She wielded truth

27:15.008 --> 27:17.385
like a Stonewood wields an axe.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.554
We revered her,

27:20.096 --> 27:22.724
and we will avenge her.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.436
No! No! The Skeksis are our lords.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.355
We do not defy our lords.

27:28.938 --> 27:32.609
Their justice was no more harsh
than her crime demanded.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.739
Grief has clouded your mind, childling.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.699
I am no childling!

27:40.158 --> 27:42.535
I was there. I saw what happened.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.996
Several of your Paladins

27:45.080 --> 27:48.708
are traveling the land
telling a very different story.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.254
Skeksis are harvesting us for essence.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.507
-Draining us of our very life force!
-Lies!

27:55.632 --> 27:57.550
The All-Maudra was a traitor!

27:57.676 --> 27:59.511
She betrayed the Seven Clans!

27:59.594 --> 28:01.221
You speak madness.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.306
I speak...

28:04.474 --> 28:06.226
as the All-Maudra.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.452
Where is everyone?

28:28.373 --> 28:29.791
Look at mess.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.044
No guards?

28:33.378 --> 28:36.339
No watch after whole clan revolts?

28:36.423 --> 28:38.925
-Heedless ingrates!

28:39.134 --> 28:40.135
That's good.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.805
That's better.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.517
That's the best.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.562
What is matter here? Have all gone mad?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.524
-And now public micturition?

28:54.607 --> 28:57.402
-Chamberlain, have you not heard?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.654
-Ooh, ah... Excuse me.
-Ugh!

29:02.866 --> 29:06.578
The General murdered the All-Maudra.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.371
-The General?
-Yes.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.207
-At the Emperor's command?
-No, no!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.209
No command at all.

29:13.293 --> 29:17.046
And then the castle guards
rose against us.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.632
We crushed them!

29:21.968 --> 29:24.637
It has been a long time
since I have experienced

29:24.971 --> 29:29.851
the heady thrill of armed combat.

29:29.934 --> 29:33.396
Emperor must be very angry at General.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.523
Hm...

29:36.983 --> 29:40.320
Perhaps I rejoin at sire's side.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.946
Yes?

29:42.489 --> 29:45.909
Come, come. See for yourself.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.285
Mm...

29:51.247 --> 29:52.707
What a feast!

29:57.212 --> 30:00.423
I'm overcome by zeal! Such ardor!

30:02.592 --> 30:05.595
Oh, yes. Look, see.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.096
Ha!

30:07.347 --> 30:09.015
Oh, my!

30:09.265 --> 30:10.767
Sweet essence!

30:15.396 --> 30:16.815
Delicious!

30:26.908 --> 30:27.909
Ah!

30:28.243 --> 30:30.036
-It's so good!

30:30.578 --> 30:32.872
-Essence everywhere.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.875
Anyway, as I was saying,

30:36.459 --> 30:40.964
essence goes much better
with roasted snoutling.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.591
-Hear, hear!
-You're probably wondering

30:43.675 --> 30:46.427
how we came by all this essence.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.180
Ah... it's a delightful tale.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.600
After the guards were defeated,

30:52.725 --> 30:55.436
we started draining them.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.523
Now, we feast on essence!

31:01.276 --> 31:04.195
Don't worry. We kept the Podlings.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.632
Stop! Stop!

31:24.716 --> 31:27.802
Stop the music. I bring news!

31:28.636 --> 31:31.389
Terrible news! Stop!

31:31.681 --> 31:34.350
-Cease all merrymaking!
- Bah!

31:34.475 --> 31:37.812
Chamberlain! I see you standing here,

31:37.896 --> 31:39.522
but no Rian.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.817
What do you have to say
before I punish you

31:42.901 --> 31:45.236
for your continued failure?

31:46.696 --> 31:48.156
As you celebrate,

31:48.239 --> 31:50.408
Gelfling of Stone-in-Wood rebel.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.870
An entire clan
has taken arms against Skeksis.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.915
I was drawn into heated battle.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.542
-I face grave danger.

31:59.626 --> 32:03.630
I fought my way out at own personal risk
to bring you this report.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.714
Bah!

32:04.797 --> 32:06.674
Stone-in-the-Wood you say?

32:07.216 --> 32:10.637
Yes. Yes!
Because of General's blundering violence!

32:10.720 --> 32:11.554
Bah...

32:11.971 --> 32:14.307
-Nonsense.
-SkekVar killed All-Maudra

32:14.515 --> 32:16.184
against Emperor's wishes.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.937
Caused all of this. Order is upended!

32:19.020 --> 32:21.022
-Huh?

32:31.908 --> 32:34.661
The General has set us free.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.205
Never again will the Skeksis
have to bear the burden

32:37.288 --> 32:40.750
of pretending to care
for these useless Gelfling.

32:41.167 --> 32:45.004
We will take what is ours
without games or pretense.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.048
We will rule forever!

32:50.677 --> 32:52.345
But... But, Emperor...

32:53.429 --> 32:54.347
Emperor.

32:55.264 --> 32:59.394
The Chamberlain here may've inadvertently
provided us with our next meal.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.688
The Stonewoods' defiance

33:01.938 --> 33:04.190
is all the justification we need

33:04.273 --> 33:07.527
to clear them out of their village
and into our larders!

33:09.445 --> 33:11.239
-We must have more essence!
-More essence!

33:11.322 --> 33:13.157
-More!
-More!

33:14.492 --> 33:17.370
-More essence!
-More essence!

33:17.912 --> 33:19.539
More!

33:19.622 --> 33:20.623
More essence!

33:22.583 --> 33:24.085
More essence!

33:27.130 --> 33:29.966
What is that I smell on you, Chamberlain?

33:33.344 --> 33:36.556
Oh! Peachberry!
SkekSil stinks of it.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.436
Into the bath with you, Chamberlain.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.895
Ah, disgusting.

33:43.604 --> 33:44.605
-Ugh, stinks!
- Get out!

33:44.689 --> 33:46.357
-You stink!
- Go on with you!

33:46.983 --> 33:48.693
Filthy! Out!

33:49.485 --> 33:51.279
Begone!

33:51.821 --> 33:54.574
-Yes. Begone, Chamberlain!

33:54.657 --> 33:57.326
Remove your fetid stench
from our presence!

33:59.871 --> 34:00.788
Let go!

34:01.330 --> 34:03.207
Let me go!

34:11.674 --> 34:12.800
Let us out!

34:15.094 --> 34:15.928
Let us out!

34:16.012 --> 34:18.848
- Do not lose hope, Paladin.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.353
Princess Tavra.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.731
-You're alive.
-For now.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.651
I'm sorry about your mother.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.280
What about my mother?

34:35.448 --> 34:36.324
You don't know.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.952
She stood up to the Skeksis.
She tried to save our lives, but...

34:46.042 --> 34:47.835
-But she's gone?

34:53.716 --> 34:56.344
Then she died doing what she had to do.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.638
What she always did.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.307
Protecting Gelfling.

35:01.724 --> 35:02.683
Mm...

35:04.852 --> 35:07.105
We must stay strong, Paladin.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.650
For the All-Maudra.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.443
For the All-Maudra.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.878
Maudras...

35:32.004 --> 35:33.714
as we all expected,

35:34.298 --> 35:37.093
Maudra Argot of Grot
did not make the journey

35:37.510 --> 35:40.680
but sent back her piece
of the Living Crown with her blessing.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.850
And so I join it with mine.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.356
You may now deliver your blessings

35:51.065 --> 35:52.733
upon my coronation.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.736
The Spriton bless the All-Maudra.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.411
The Sifa bless the All-Maudra.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.667
Hm.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.503
The Dousan bless the All-Maudra.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.011
Hm.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.808
-The Stonewood withhold.
-What?

36:28.561 --> 36:29.729
Maudra Laesid.

36:30.813 --> 36:33.107
The Drenchen withhold.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.108
Oh, no.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.527
This has never happened before.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.741
I am the eldest daughter
of the fallen All-Maudra,

36:41.991 --> 36:43.993
heir to the Vapran throne,

36:44.410 --> 36:46.454
next in the line of succession.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.541
The All-Maudra
has not always been a Vapran.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.044
But the Skeksis decreed it.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.047
-Yes.
-The Skeksis who imprison our children

36:56.422 --> 36:59.550
-and take our lives for themselves.

36:59.967 --> 37:05.139
A war is coming, and Seladon
is not the one to lead us into battle.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.601
It's my mother's crown. It belongs to me.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.813
I would've followed her
into a nest of Spitters, but not you.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.733
- I challenge Seladon...

37:16.692 --> 37:18.361
for the Living Crown!

37:18.903 --> 37:22.323
-Fara, don't do this.
-Let us not act rashly.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.617
Better we wait and bide our time.

37:24.700 --> 37:29.121
Maudra Fara, I beg you to reconsider.
We cannot stand against the Skeksis.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.540
They are few, we are many.

37:32.875 --> 37:36.254
We can fight! I will lead us to victory!

37:36.587 --> 37:38.965
But the Skeksis are immortal.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.968
How can you defeat an enemy
that cannot die?

37:42.051 --> 37:45.221
Maudra Fara has invoked a challenge.

37:45.888 --> 37:48.266
It is her right to choose the nature.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.144
-Trial by air.

37:52.228 --> 37:56.148
Tests and trials are the Skeksis ways,
not Gelfling.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.150
How have we come to this?

38:00.236 --> 38:01.821
Be wary, Fara.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.741
Seladon is very clever.
She leaves nothing to chance.

38:05.825 --> 38:10.204
I would wager on the strength
of my wings against hers any day.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.664
I accept.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.959
Trial by air.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.295
Victor takes the crown.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.214
Of course.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.552
I will take no pleasure
in besting you... childling.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.160
Mm?

38:55.875 --> 38:57.543
-Hm?

39:03.799 --> 39:05.801
-Hm?

39:10.848 --> 39:13.934
Easy, Lore. Easy, Lore.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.648
What is that?

39:22.109 --> 39:23.361
The Dousan.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.237
I've never met a Dousan before.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.157
They rarely travel
beyond their beloved desert.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.702
The Dousan are the only clan forbidden
from being castle guards.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.663
The Skeksis told us they worship death.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.923
Whoa!

40:03.734 --> 40:05.152
He looks fun.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.000
<i>Gidakai kae.</i>

40:20.418 --> 40:21.794
To the great All,

40:22.336 --> 40:24.880
may the dead become one with Thra again.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.299
May we feel their tears in rain

40:27.716 --> 40:29.718
and their warmth in the suns.

40:30.177 --> 40:33.222
Though they are gone,
they remain with us still.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.933
That was beautiful.

40:36.934 --> 40:40.479
But trifling compared to the depths
of your emotion.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.859
Your song was carried to us
on the desert winds.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.695
We heard its melody
and were deeply moved.

40:48.821 --> 40:52.283
These passings
were very important to you. True?

40:54.577 --> 40:56.328
We have taken many losses.

40:56.912 --> 40:58.789
Friends, parents...

40:59.832 --> 41:01.333
even the All-Maudra.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.754
Yes, we have heard of her passing.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.424
The windsifters have flown.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.677
She was my mother.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.138
I should've known, Princess.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.977
My name is Rek'yr,

41:20.728 --> 41:23.022
Sandmaster of the Southern Xeric.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.440
I'm Brea.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.402
-Here, a simple charm, Princess.
-Oh!

41:31.947 --> 41:32.948
Huh.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.578
Made from Moog bone for protection.

41:39.371 --> 41:43.000
If I or any of my crew
can be of assistance...

41:44.168 --> 41:45.211
Uh...

41:45.794 --> 41:46.837
Actually,

41:47.379 --> 41:50.758
a few of us seek safe passage
across the Crystal Desert.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.970
Bennu and myself
would be happy to carry you.

41:55.596 --> 41:58.224
It would be an honor
to take you, Princess.

41:58.933 --> 41:59.767
Thank you.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.479
My friends and I need to reach
the Circle of the Suns

42:03.562 --> 42:05.564
-as soon as possible.
-You seek the Circle?

42:06.273 --> 42:07.441
A cursed ruin.

42:07.858 --> 42:10.236
-Dangerous. Forbidden.

42:10.694 --> 42:13.239
Allow me to escort you
to the Wellspring instead,

42:13.572 --> 42:15.157
a verdant oasis with crystal--

42:15.241 --> 42:16.617
No. If you're too scared,
then it's all right.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.411
-We can find another way.
-Very well. Very well.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.039
I will take you as far as I am able.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.209
Thank you. We are forever in your debt.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.002
-Mm.
- Um...

42:27.753 --> 42:29.213
Would you excuse us?

42:30.172 --> 42:31.173
Thank you.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.217
What are you doing?

42:33.300 --> 42:35.469
Wait. You don't trust Rek'yr? Why?

42:36.262 --> 42:38.138
-Well, for starters,

42:38.264 --> 42:39.431
he's a Dousan.

42:40.724 --> 42:43.686
-They're obsessed with death.
-They're not obsessed.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.604
He gave you bones.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.108
-I like it.
-Uh...

42:51.735 --> 42:54.530
We graciously accept your offer.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.367
Then we sail at your command.

42:59.076 --> 42:59.910
Hm.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.918
Sail at your command!

43:11.255 --> 43:12.631
I don't like him either.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.384
Come on, Hup. It'll be fun!

43:25.853 --> 43:28.272
Well, I suppose
this is where we say goodbye.

43:28.981 --> 43:31.066
We must light the fires of resistance.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.944
And spread the truth
across the Seven Clans.

43:34.862 --> 43:35.821
Come here.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.115
- Mm.
-Farewell, Rian.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.035
Take care of yourself.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.330
You too... bold Gurjin.

43:44.413 --> 43:47.833
Ha! I like that. Bold Gurjin.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.985
So, the hunt continues.

44:31.627 --> 44:34.213
Don't fear. She's only a frightened child.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.297
She's no threat.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.133
So you've chosen
the course for this day's trial by air?

44:38.217 --> 44:41.136
-We'll fly Raunip's Pass.
-A dangerous route.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.731
<i> How many trine</i>
<i>since a challenge was issued?</i>

44:52.815 --> 44:54.400
I don't even know.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.360
Six hundred and thirty-nine.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.737
This is a wretched business.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.866
Seladon is late. More games!

45:03.409 --> 45:06.412
<i> Perhaps smashing her wings</i>
<i>upon the rocks will knock some sense</i>

45:06.495 --> 45:08.539
<i>into the entitled little princess.</i>

45:12.710 --> 45:17.423
Enough waiting.
It's obvious Seladon dares not face me.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.633
The Living Crown is mine.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.018
The princess.

45:30.102 --> 45:31.937
She looks like a Skeksis.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.108
Loyal Maudras,

45:37.109 --> 45:39.403
I am humbled by your presence

45:39.486 --> 45:42.823
on the day of my coronation.

45:43.198 --> 45:46.785
You are not All-Maudra.
Not while my challenge stands.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.328
Or have you forgotten?

45:48.746 --> 45:49.997
I remember well.

45:50.956 --> 45:54.042
I hereby forfeit my claim
to the Living Crown.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.794
-What? Is it over then?

45:56.670 --> 45:59.047
Take your soiled trinket, Fara.

46:03.051 --> 46:06.305
This crown belonged to my friend!
Your mother.

46:09.767 --> 46:13.854
Her traitorous blood
has forever stained the Living Crown.

46:14.396 --> 46:16.774
What was once a symbol of Gelfling unity

46:16.857 --> 46:19.526
is now the sad relic
of a failed rebellion.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.197
That is why I have forged a new crown

46:23.697 --> 46:25.365
to symbolize a new future

46:26.158 --> 46:27.743
for all Gelfling.

46:28.702 --> 46:32.414
You defile her legacy
with that abomination.

46:32.956 --> 46:37.336
And you invite ruin
with your feckless rush to war.

46:37.419 --> 46:38.337
Oh!

46:38.462 --> 46:41.340
-The Skeksis, in their infinite wisdom...

46:41.423 --> 46:44.635
...named me All-Maudra
upon my mother's death, just as---

46:44.718 --> 46:46.720
Skeksis are draining Gelfling!

46:47.554 --> 46:49.890
-Lies.
-You will never be All-Maudra!

46:50.349 --> 46:53.727
I am All-Maudra.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.441
No!

47:00.234 --> 47:02.986
I will have justice!

47:06.907 --> 47:09.868
I will see the Skeksis punished
for their crimes.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.913
I will be All-Maudra!

47:13.247 --> 47:15.249
You will bow.

47:15.874 --> 47:17.417
I will never bow!

47:19.795 --> 47:23.006
Then you will crawl!

47:28.178 --> 47:29.555
- Fara!

47:32.349 --> 47:33.183
This...

47:33.934 --> 47:36.061
This is the discord my mother has sown.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.438
This is the inevitable end of rebellion.

47:38.897 --> 47:42.776
Gelfling turning on Gelfling.
We stand on the brink of anarchy!

47:46.071 --> 47:47.573
Bow before me, Maudra Fara.

47:48.448 --> 47:51.285
And together
we will prove our loyalty to the Skeksis

47:51.368 --> 47:53.871
and snuff this fire
before it burns us all.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.377
As you burned your own mother.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.050
Paladins!

48:10.137 --> 48:12.306
Escort Fara from the citadel.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.978
-No need. I know the way.
-As do I.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.397
It is the rest of you who are lost.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.577
And what will you three choose?

48:34.536 --> 48:35.579
Order...

48:36.580 --> 48:37.831
or chaos?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.876
This is not the Gelfling way.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.340
It is now.
