00:55.524 --> 00:56.931
Are we going up there?

00:57.027 --> 00:58.084
Yeah, no, you are.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.515
We're gonna stay down the
bottom and have lunch.

01:00.996 --> 01:02.435
Hey, don't touch the driver.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.491
Yes, there kind of is.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.324
No, there's not.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.531
OK, they don't
hire the prostitutes.

01:07.971 --> 01:10.211
- It's nothing that I listen to.
- Yeah.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.588
I listen to the old classics.

01:11.684 --> 01:13.219
"The old classics"?

01:13.251 --> 01:15.042
- Playboi Carti is...
- It's political.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.844
It's political.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.436
Playboi Carti is not
an old classic.

01:18.468 --> 01:19.268
I don't listen to him.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.156
I listen to the old...
It's political.

01:21.188 --> 01:24.068
"I don't listen to him."
"I don't listen to him."

01:24.100 --> 01:25.795
<i>It's just so...</i>

01:25.827 --> 01:29.699
<i>You know, they have one song.
They're, like, four min... no,</i>

01:29.796 --> 01:30.980
<i>It's, like, eight minutes, say.</i>

01:31.011 --> 01:31.940
<i>It's pretty.</i>

01:31.971 --> 01:35.202
<i>And it just goes...</i>

01:35.235 --> 01:37.219
<i>That's so vibe-y.</i>

01:37.251 --> 01:39.075
<i>And not in a good way.</i>

01:39.171 --> 01:40.962
<i>It's like if you just took...</i>

01:40.995 --> 01:43.524
<i>OK, if you look up
on the right here,</i>

01:43.556 --> 01:47.811
you will see the site that, uh...

01:49.124 --> 01:50.691
You passed a speed trap,
Hoaggie.

01:50.787 --> 01:51.619
What?

01:51.651 --> 01:53.475
- You passed a speed trap.
- Oh, shit.

01:54.884 --> 01:58.211
They just don't
have any talent.

01:58.242 --> 01:59.780
Yeah, but if we're
talking about lyrics,

01:59.811 --> 02:01.379
some people do have
lots of talent.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.332
- Yeah. But that's...
- In the way they deliver it.

02:03.428 --> 02:05.891
Well, they had some.

02:05.922 --> 02:07.939
No, but your
music is just noise.

02:07.971 --> 02:09.411
<i>It's just lots of noise.</i>

02:09.443 --> 02:11.331
<i>It's not arranged.
It's not in order.</i>

02:11.364 --> 02:12.932
<i>It's the same sequence...</i>

02:13.124 --> 02:15.651
Excuse me, sir. Do you realize
how fast you were going?

02:15.779 --> 02:16.804
No, no, no.

02:16.836 --> 02:20.804
But to say that
their music is bad

02:20.900 --> 02:23.811
is different than saying that
you don't like their music.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.731
I don't like them,
and they're just bad.

02:25.764 --> 02:28.452
OK, well, you don't know
anything about the real world.

02:28.484 --> 02:30.308
I'm going to hit that phone
out of your hand.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.971
No, you're not.

02:32.260 --> 02:33.635
Oh, real mature.

02:33.795 --> 02:34.755
Hey!

02:37.028 --> 02:38.948
Do you think I'm kidding?

02:48.804 --> 02:50.243
Hey, how do you, um...

02:51.684 --> 02:53.316
Tap to make a jump.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.811
All right, there you go.

03:12.131 --> 03:13.091
<i>Hey, Hoaggie?</i>

03:13.412 --> 03:14.724
<i>No, you've already eaten.</i>

03:14.756 --> 03:17.219
Yeah, but it's part of
the road trip experience.

03:17.444 --> 03:18.755
"The road trip experience..."

03:18.851 --> 03:20.099
All right, sure,
pass it here.

03:22.148 --> 03:23.939
No, no, no, you can just
share this one.

03:24.739 --> 03:26.659
I'll tell you what, if you can
communicate with me

03:26.691 --> 03:29.732
in a mature, adult level,
I will concede.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.322
All right, suit yourself.

03:32.419 --> 03:33.891
They're two for $3.15.

03:53.411 --> 03:55.748
<i>A hundred bottles
of beer on the wall,</i>

03:55.844 --> 03:57.668
<i>a hundred bottles of beer.</i>

03:57.924 --> 04:00.162
<i>Take one down, pass it around.</i>

04:00.260 --> 04:02.212
<i>99 bottles of beer on the wall.</i>

04:03.172 --> 04:04.259
That's not in order.

04:04.356 --> 04:06.148
- We'll do it in rounds.
- No, please, no.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.332
- We'll do it in rounds.
- Please, no.

04:07.364 --> 04:08.292
No, you love that.

04:08.324 --> 04:09.762
- I hate that.
- You love that.

04:09.795 --> 04:10.755
Let's do rounds.

04:44.548 --> 04:45.315
It fascinates me, you know?

04:45.412 --> 04:48.740
You get two eggs
from the same basket,

04:49.379 --> 04:52.196
and one of them
is this lovely, gentle,

04:52.228 --> 04:54.882
patient boy
and the other one's...

04:55.842 --> 04:57.860
What?

04:57.892 --> 04:58.979
An egg?

05:00.324 --> 05:01.475
Yeah.

05:18.212 --> 05:19.203
Knock, knock.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.163
Who's there?

05:20.196 --> 05:21.348
Banana.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.852
Banana, who?

05:22.883 --> 05:24.195
Knock, knock.

05:24.803 --> 05:25.859
Who's there?

05:25.956 --> 05:26.692
Banana.

05:26.723 --> 05:27.939
Banana, who?

05:28.035 --> 05:28.995
Knock, knock.

05:29.442 --> 05:30.819
- Who's there?
- Banana.

05:30.948 --> 05:31.875
Banana, who?

05:31.971 --> 05:33.186
Knock, knock.

05:33.764 --> 05:34.692
Who's there?

05:34.724 --> 05:36.388
- Orange.
- Orange, who?

05:36.548 --> 05:37.955
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

05:41.252 --> 05:42.755
<i>That's just terrible.</i>

05:44.132 --> 05:45.348
I don't suck.

05:46.052 --> 05:47.268
You do suck, bro.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.019
<i>You suck.
You suck more.</i>

05:50.115 --> 05:51.395
<i>I'm not "who's there."</i>

05:51.652 --> 05:52.932
- <i>Knock, knock.</i>
- <i>Who's there?</i>

05:52.964 --> 05:54.467
- Doctor.
- Doctor, who?

05:54.500 --> 05:55.460
Ah!

06:31.268 --> 06:33.059
Hey, I don't want a photo
of your bums.

06:39.491 --> 06:40.772
OK!

06:40.868 --> 06:41.572
OK.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.659
'K, 'K, 'K, 'K, 'K.

06:42.756 --> 06:43.588
Go.

06:57.731 --> 06:59.012
What are you thinking about?

07:00.099 --> 07:01.155
Ah, just work.

07:01.571 --> 07:02.819
<i>They just don't have any...</i>

07:02.852 --> 07:04.164
You boys enjoying the view?

07:04.195 --> 07:05.699
<i>Yeah, it's great.</i>

07:06.627 --> 07:07.492
<i>I'm talking about...</i>

07:07.523 --> 07:09.507
Jenny's still giving me
the third degree.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.588
Oh, the Coromandel thing,
the shared batch thing.

07:11.684 --> 07:12.675
I want the boys
to have a place

07:12.708 --> 07:15.875
to spend their summers
with a sense of community.

07:15.971 --> 07:17.316
We're OK with not having that.

07:17.412 --> 07:20.451
Yeah, I'm personally not
craving a sense of community.

07:20.548 --> 07:22.148
And what about the obligatory
committee meetings

07:22.244 --> 07:24.068
the politics, the passive
aggression?

07:24.324 --> 07:25.700
- Alan.
- No, I'm serious.

07:25.732 --> 07:27.395
I had to organize
a fundraiser with Jenny

07:27.523 --> 07:29.284
and it was impossible.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.819
- I got so angry...
- Alan.

07:30.915 --> 07:32.420
Well, I almost said something.

07:43.972 --> 07:44.932
Can we help you?

07:52.964 --> 07:53.955
This is nice.

07:56.708 --> 07:57.668
Very nice.

07:57.763 --> 07:59.363
Is this a family picnic, man?

08:05.604 --> 08:07.843
I should probably introduce
myself, shouldn't I?

08:09.059 --> 08:10.148
I'm Mandrake.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.051
And you are...?

08:19.396 --> 08:20.387
Oh, I'm...

08:20.420 --> 08:22.467
I'm Alan and this
is my wife Jill.

08:22.659 --> 08:24.323
G'day, Alan.
G'day, Jill.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.299
Who you got there?

08:28.131 --> 08:29.443
Thompson and Thompson?

08:30.051 --> 08:33.347
Um, this is Jordan,
and Maika.

08:34.148 --> 08:35.107
Hey, boys.

08:37.028 --> 08:37.988
Oof.

08:39.491 --> 08:40.451
Far out, eh?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.619
Got the whole place
to yourselves.

08:49.123 --> 08:51.267
Privacy is a strange thing,
isn't it, eh?

08:53.187 --> 08:56.484
I mean, here we are
a world apart,

08:56.515 --> 08:59.203
yet even as we speak,

08:59.235 --> 09:02.723
we got internet, radio waves
running right through us.

09:08.739 --> 09:11.556
Nah, I can't hear anything
out this way.

09:16.996 --> 09:17.956
Mom...

09:18.179 --> 09:19.363
It's OK, Maika.

09:25.827 --> 09:27.171
They can't hear us.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.476
And we can't hear them.

09:30.819 --> 09:32.739
They got no idea
we're even alive.

09:38.243 --> 09:39.875
See you're curious
about the gun.

09:40.931 --> 09:41.827
Do you boys
want to take a look at it?

09:41.860 --> 09:44.323
- You stay away from...
- Tut-tut-tut-tut, dad.

09:44.355 --> 09:45.731
No need to get
jumpy there, mate.

09:46.019 --> 09:46.947
Just trying to
make conversation.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.067
Why don't you sit down, dad?

09:55.971 --> 09:56.931
Mom...

09:57.924 --> 09:59.427
Maika, look at me.

10:00.196 --> 10:00.771
It's OK.

10:00.804 --> 10:02.083
You just stay there.

10:02.116 --> 10:03.011
You're all right.

10:03.043 --> 10:04.131
Good on you, mum.

10:06.915 --> 10:08.675
As long as everyone does
as they're told,

10:09.219 --> 10:11.076
this will all be over
in no time, eh?

10:11.395 --> 10:12.259
What do you want?

10:12.355 --> 10:14.916
Well, thank you so much
for asking me, Jill.

10:15.012 --> 10:16.611
I take it that
fine family vehicle

10:16.643 --> 10:18.787
I saw just over the bridge
there belongs to you lot.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.891
GPS, three tiered seating,
those fancy little cup holders.

10:21.924 --> 10:24.452
Here, just take it.
Just please...

10:24.547 --> 10:26.243
Well, thank you so much.

10:27.267 --> 10:29.379
Would you mind turning out your
pockets while you're at it?

10:39.075 --> 10:40.131
Beautiful.

10:47.331 --> 10:49.379
Yeah, I'm no
mathematician but, um...

10:49.603 --> 10:51.299
We made him leave
his phone at home.

10:51.332 --> 10:54.339
He's still grounded,
technically.

10:56.803 --> 10:58.691
That's probably
very wise, dad.

11:00.771 --> 11:01.540
You gotta teach 'em
to respect you

11:01.571 --> 11:03.747
before they can
respect themselves.

11:07.491 --> 11:08.899
All right, if you could just all
pop yourselves down

11:08.931 --> 11:10.563
on the blanket over there,
heads facing that way,

11:10.596 --> 11:12.067
that'd be much appreciated.

11:18.051 --> 11:19.139
In your own time.

11:22.979 --> 11:24.611
Boys, just come here.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.019
Do exactly what he says, OK?

11:28.739 --> 11:30.756
Come on. Let's just do what
you're told, OK?

11:48.228 --> 11:49.603
OK, we're gonna head off.

11:51.075 --> 11:52.643
Don't turn around now.

11:52.836 --> 11:54.596
It's OK.
Come on.

12:00.451 --> 12:01.507
Hoaggie.

12:02.436 --> 12:03.652
What was that?
What'd you say?

12:04.131 --> 12:05.060
It's just...

12:05.091 --> 12:06.276
- What?
- No, just...

12:06.307 --> 12:07.107
Hey, what'd you say?

12:07.139 --> 12:08.452
They call me...
It's just a nickname.

12:08.484 --> 12:10.275
- What's the nickname?
- Hoaggie.

12:24.323 --> 12:25.347
Hoaggenraad.

12:26.276 --> 12:26.885
Am I pronouncing it correctly,
Hoaggenraad?

12:26.915 --> 12:28.483
Yeah, that's... that's right.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.987
Can't be too many
of those around.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.236
- It's Dutch.
- Interesting name.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.900
Yeah, as interesting
as Mandrake?

12:35.396 --> 12:36.803
I'm a magician.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.779
I make things disappear.

12:40.899 --> 12:42.275
Let me look at you.

12:42.627 --> 12:43.779
Hey?

12:47.171 --> 12:48.131
Hoaggenraad.

13:01.123 --> 13:02.563
Hoaggie!

13:02.916 --> 13:04.419
I like it.
I like Hoaggie.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.315
It's friendly.

13:05.347 --> 13:08.451
And, um, yeah,
actually I know a Hoaggie.

13:08.964 --> 13:10.340
Where do I know the
name Hoaggie from?

13:10.371 --> 13:11.139
Oh, I don't know.

13:11.171 --> 13:12.260
Yeah, come on,
you must know, man.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.379
- I really don't.
- Come on.

13:13.411 --> 13:15.140
I usually have such a good
memory for this stuff, too.

13:15.171 --> 13:16.356
Jill, where do I know
Hoaggie from?

13:16.387 --> 13:17.060
I'm not sure.

13:17.987 --> 13:19.203
Hey, Tubs, mate,
where have I heard the name

13:19.236 --> 13:20.675
Hoaggie from before?

13:20.771 --> 13:22.915
I know it's...
Ah, come on, Hoaggie.

13:22.947 --> 13:25.123
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

13:32.291 --> 13:32.836
Hey.

13:33.796 --> 13:34.756
Got company.

13:50.116 --> 13:51.747
All right, everybody up.
Everybody up.

13:51.843 --> 13:52.643
Come on.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

13:52.675 --> 13:54.500
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Sh, sh, sh.

13:54.595 --> 13:55.683
Up, up, up.
Up, up.

13:55.716 --> 13:56.676
Get up.

13:58.499 --> 13:59.459
Good boy.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.211
All right, everybody.
Play at happy campers, there.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.131
Happy campers.

14:41.827 --> 14:42.820
Mom.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.772
Eyes on them, mate.

14:56.388 --> 14:57.252
Okay, let's not be rude.

14:57.284 --> 14:59.236
Everybody give 'em a wave.
Give 'em a wave.

14:59.939 --> 15:00.899
Don't be rude.

15:08.547 --> 15:11.267
You know, later on, when you're
looking back at this occasion...

15:12.419 --> 15:13.411
I think that right
there is going

15:13.443 --> 15:15.588
to be the moment you wish
you had done something.

15:41.123 --> 15:42.883
What the fuck have you done?!
What the fuck have you done?!

15:55.972 --> 15:57.764
When the sun goes down,
we'll make a move.

15:59.588 --> 16:00.644
Getting cold.

16:00.676 --> 16:03.620
Yes, but tonight we don't have
to be out in it, do we?

16:03.652 --> 16:04.995
Which makes a nice change.

16:07.171 --> 16:08.899
Tell you what,
why don't you go, um,

16:08.931 --> 16:12.068
take those kids,
put 'em somewhere.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.956
Food's not going anywhere.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.059
Don't suppose you've got
any booze, do you, old son?

16:30.883 --> 16:31.843
Ah.

16:32.356 --> 16:33.316
No?

16:33.411 --> 16:34.308
Jill?

16:36.356 --> 16:37.731
What a pity.

17:28.036 --> 17:29.571
Fuck you!

17:30.435 --> 17:32.195
Fuck you!

17:32.451 --> 17:33.891
Fuck you all!

17:37.155 --> 17:39.075
Fuck you...

17:42.851 --> 17:45.252
You just never, never,
never, never, never know

17:45.284 --> 17:47.268
where the day is
gonna take you, eh?

17:48.642 --> 17:49.602
Hoaggie?

17:50.948 --> 17:53.091
You see, I didn't wake up
this morning thinking,

17:53.124 --> 17:54.852
"Oh, this is where I'll be
by this evening,"

17:54.884 --> 17:57.251
and yet here we are.

18:00.804 --> 18:02.339
What've we got here...

18:04.131 --> 18:06.851
"Jill Marama Booth."

18:07.842 --> 18:09.156
Fascinating.

18:09.348 --> 18:10.979
Kept her name.

18:11.939 --> 18:13.988
Bit bloody modern,
don't you reckon?

18:14.276 --> 18:15.876
You better kill me
really quickly because

18:15.908 --> 18:17.571
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

19:51.555 --> 19:53.859
Yeah, I reckon I might drive
for a little bit, eh?

19:54.915 --> 19:57.155
Why don't you, uh, sit
in the back with Hoaggie?

19:58.339 --> 20:00.035
Just thought of a
change of plans.

20:00.323 --> 20:01.379
A quick detour.

20:04.419 --> 20:05.348
<i>Come on.</i>

20:16.580 --> 20:17.507
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey.

20:17.540 --> 20:18.532
Shh.

20:20.579 --> 20:22.659
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.842
Yeah, I can live with this.

20:44.004 --> 20:45.795
All right. Let's buckle up,
everyone.

20:53.475 --> 20:54.980
Where are you taking us?

20:57.348 --> 20:58.371
Home.

21:57.795 --> 21:59.363
It's a damn shame.

22:01.156 --> 22:04.100
It is amazing how
just a little bit of music

22:04.132 --> 22:05.475
can lighten the mood.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.115
How's the philosophy,
old son?

22:38.531 --> 22:40.386
I'm guessing you probably
wouldn't know it to look at me,

22:40.483 --> 22:41.859
but I'm actually a bit
of a sort of sucker

22:41.892 --> 22:43.266
when it comes to reading.

22:46.276 --> 22:48.066
Reckon I would have done
all right at university, too,

22:48.163 --> 22:50.180
if things had been different.

22:53.604 --> 22:56.228
You know, not to knock
your profession, but...

22:56.324 --> 22:59.076
I just think that every lesson
you can be taught

22:59.172 --> 23:01.892
will occur in the course
of your life anyway, you know?

23:06.371 --> 23:07.748
Something I've been sitting
on for a while.

23:07.779 --> 23:09.283
I want to get your take on it.

23:21.475 --> 23:23.876
Not safe to leave a driver alone
to his thoughts, Hoaggie.

23:28.643 --> 23:30.788
"Not to knock my profession."

23:30.819 --> 23:32.868
Is that a question?

23:33.795 --> 23:36.035
I didn't tell you
I was a teacher.

23:37.252 --> 23:39.011
You are a teacher
though, right?

23:41.348 --> 23:43.332
Pretty certain you told me
at some point.

23:43.364 --> 23:44.324
But you're probably having
a bit of trouble

23:44.355 --> 23:45.763
remembering, you know?

23:46.723 --> 23:49.603
The shock of it all.

24:20.579 --> 24:21.668
Dirt.

24:21.795 --> 24:22.628
No.

24:23.236 --> 24:24.163
Dark.

24:24.196 --> 24:24.995
No.

24:25.283 --> 24:26.436
Dust.

24:26.468 --> 24:28.131
Same as dirt.

24:28.931 --> 24:30.051
Desert.

24:30.435 --> 24:31.107
No.

24:31.139 --> 24:32.067
No, come on.

24:32.099 --> 24:33.827
Um, ta, ta.

24:33.860 --> 24:35.843
Um, driver?
Me?

24:36.740 --> 24:37.475
No.

24:37.571 --> 24:38.115
No?

24:38.275 --> 24:39.556
I give up.

24:41.091 --> 24:42.275
Distance.

24:42.371 --> 24:43.396
Eh?

24:43.748 --> 24:44.676
Distance.

24:44.708 --> 24:45.668
Yeah, no, I heard you
the first time, Tubs.

24:45.699 --> 24:47.203
I don't think that's...

24:47.683 --> 24:49.123
That's a bit bloody
abstract, mate.

24:49.156 --> 24:51.140
I don't think it's allowed,
if I'm being honest.

24:51.171 --> 24:53.348
You wouldn't be saying that
if you'd figured it out.

25:00.676 --> 25:02.115
Where are the boys?

25:05.828 --> 25:07.363
I'll get us through this.

25:07.587 --> 25:08.899
- I promise, I'll...
- Oh no.

25:08.931 --> 25:09.699
I'll get us...

25:09.732 --> 25:11.267
I'll get us through
this, I promise.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.379
Ah!

25:13.412 --> 25:15.459
Come on, Jill,
it's better this way.

25:15.588 --> 25:17.219
Yeah, shh.

25:18.595 --> 25:20.067
You know how boys can be.

25:20.099 --> 25:21.092
They'd have gotten in the way.

25:21.123 --> 25:24.099
And at least they didn't
have to suffer, you know?

25:25.859 --> 25:29.476
Not really, not like some.

25:36.387 --> 25:37.220
Shh.

25:37.316 --> 25:38.467
Look at it like this, Jill.

25:40.963 --> 25:42.339
The worst has happened.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.923
You're a fucking murderer!

25:46.275 --> 25:48.099
Shh.

25:48.611 --> 25:50.115
As opposed to what now?

25:50.787 --> 25:52.131
A fucking accountant?

25:52.164 --> 25:56.195
Shh. Shh.

26:12.036 --> 26:12.899
Who's next?

26:12.932 --> 26:14.115
Who is next?

26:14.148 --> 26:15.651
Who's got one, eh?

26:16.483 --> 26:17.667
Come on.
Jill, what about you?

26:17.699 --> 26:18.627
Come on, I Spy.

26:18.659 --> 26:19.971
No, this isn't happening.

26:20.004 --> 26:21.507
I hate to disappoint you,
love.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.331
I spy with my little eye...

26:23.363 --> 26:24.291
Leave her alone!

26:24.323 --> 26:26.020
Something beginning with...

26:26.051 --> 26:27.396
F, F. I'll play.
Just just...

26:27.427 --> 26:28.356
- I spy...
- For fuck's sake!

26:28.387 --> 26:30.372
...with my little eye
something beginning...

26:30.403 --> 26:32.931
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with F.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.979
- Fence.
- Fence.

26:41.540 --> 26:42.403
Yes.

26:43.747 --> 26:45.347
Shh.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.035
Well, that was easy.

26:50.243 --> 26:51.363
Shh.

26:52.676 --> 26:53.955
Shh.

26:57.315 --> 26:58.275
Good on ya, mate.

27:34.467 --> 27:35.331
Hmm?

27:36.131 --> 27:37.155
No, mate.

27:38.467 --> 27:39.588
Absolutely not.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.891
Tubs and I recently had
an unfortunate experience

27:46.019 --> 27:47.907
with a Mercedes.

27:48.195 --> 27:50.435
Don't think we had time
to get used to it, did we?

27:52.739 --> 27:53.892
So, the owner of the Merc?

27:53.923 --> 27:55.812
Surprisingly narrow
taste in music.

27:55.843 --> 27:59.300
Can you believe that he had
one CD in his whole glove box?

28:00.163 --> 28:01.123
One.

28:03.427 --> 28:05.091
You always do
what you're told?

28:11.364 --> 28:12.195
You know what, Jill?

28:12.227 --> 28:13.603
I feel a bit bloody rotten
about this,

28:14.787 --> 28:15.907
but I haven't actually asked
you what you do for a living.

28:16.132 --> 28:16.995
You know?

28:17.892 --> 28:19.683
We covered real ground
here with Hoaggie.

28:19.716 --> 28:22.563
So what is it that you do?

28:22.596 --> 28:24.131
- She's a teacher.
- I was asking Jill.

28:24.163 --> 28:25.251
She doesn't want to talk
to you so I'm talking to you.

28:25.347 --> 28:26.339
Same school?
Different school?

28:26.371 --> 28:27.459
Same school.

28:27.492 --> 28:28.963
Hoaggie, could you please
just give your wife a chance

28:28.995 --> 28:30.339
to respond, thank you?

28:34.979 --> 28:36.675
That's a noble profession, Jill.

28:37.252 --> 28:39.907
Nurturing the minds of the
nation's youth together.

28:41.571 --> 28:42.883
A teaching couple.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.732
Well, is it primary?
Secondary?

28:45.763 --> 28:48.195
- Secondary.
- Oh, same age as your boys.

28:51.075 --> 28:52.259
How long have you been
working there...

28:52.356 --> 28:53.604
Where did you say you worked?

28:53.636 --> 28:55.011
We didn't.

28:55.236 --> 28:56.163
Wellington College.

28:56.196 --> 28:57.315
How long you been there?

28:58.340 --> 29:00.163
She's been there five years.
I've been there six.

29:00.195 --> 29:01.763
And where were you
before that?

29:02.819 --> 29:04.003
I was at Scots College.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.411
And how long were
you at Scots for?

29:05.443 --> 29:06.500
Fuck, I don't know...

29:06.531 --> 29:07.395
But it wasn't the first place
that you worked, was it?

29:07.427 --> 29:08.964
No, it wasn't the
first place I worked at.

29:08.996 --> 29:11.363
OK, so where were
you before that?

29:11.587 --> 29:12.676
I was at Horowhenua College.

29:12.708 --> 29:13.572
And where were
you before that?

29:13.603 --> 29:14.724
Before that I was
at teacher's college.

29:14.756 --> 29:16.227
- Before that?
- Before that...

29:16.259 --> 29:18.179
I was fucking nobody.

29:27.491 --> 29:28.771
And before that?

29:43.811 --> 29:45.091
All right. Ok, then.

29:45.316 --> 29:46.627
What's that, man?

29:48.228 --> 29:49.027
When were you there?

29:49.059 --> 29:50.787
- When was I where?
- Hakawai Point.

29:50.819 --> 29:51.876
Hakawai Point...

29:51.971 --> 29:54.052
Oh, that's the, um...

29:54.084 --> 29:55.940
- That's that boy's home that's...
- Yeah.

29:55.972 --> 29:57.411
Oh, yeah.

29:58.563 --> 30:00.419
Yeah, a bit rough some of those
places though, ain't they?

30:00.451 --> 30:01.347
So I hear.

30:01.379 --> 30:02.436
Oh, but you were there?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.003
No, it was just
a training stint,

30:04.035 --> 30:06.147
you know,
in the schoolhouse.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.107
I was in and out.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.196
Oh, yeah, in and out.

30:08.227 --> 30:09.059
Yeah, I didn't see anything.

30:09.091 --> 30:11.076
What would you have
seen if you were?

30:11.107 --> 30:13.156
Well, it doesn't bear
mentioning, does it?

30:13.859 --> 30:16.132
Hey, Tubs, you spent a bit
of time at Hakawai Point,

30:16.164 --> 30:17.475
didn't you, mate?

30:18.371 --> 30:20.291
Did you enjoy your
time there, Tubs?

30:20.323 --> 30:20.900
Eh?

30:20.932 --> 30:22.467
I was there in 1988.

30:22.563 --> 30:24.035
It was before his time.

30:29.923 --> 30:30.660
Actually, you know what?

30:30.692 --> 30:33.027
Uh, yeah, Hakawai Point
was, um...

30:36.164 --> 30:39.395
Tubs, was... It's the place where
what's-his-face come from, um...

30:40.867 --> 30:42.371
Rudy Bocock, you know?

30:42.403 --> 30:44.323
He knocked over that RSA.

30:44.547 --> 30:46.563
You know, he beat a bunch
of senior citizens

30:46.596 --> 30:48.291
to death with a cricket
bat or something.

30:48.387 --> 30:50.179
It was around Foxton ways, eh?

30:51.556 --> 30:54.755
Glen Lecky was a right asshole,
too, and he was from there.

30:54.883 --> 30:56.675
And Mark Sitko.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.076
No, wait, Mark Sitko
was at Epuni.

31:01.316 --> 31:03.523
Any of these names ring a bell
for you, Hoaggie?

31:03.555 --> 31:04.611
Like I said, it
was a long time ago.

31:04.643 --> 31:06.084
Yeah, most of these guys
have been on the national news

31:06.116 --> 31:06.884
at one time or another.

31:06.916 --> 31:07.908
And believe it or not,
not everyone

31:07.940 --> 31:09.636
who went there turned into
a fucking psychopath.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.331
We were actually helping kids.

31:11.427 --> 31:12.483
How'd you get the help
that you needed

31:12.516 --> 31:14.179
while you were there, Tubs?

31:26.563 --> 31:27.619
What wing were you in?

31:27.651 --> 31:29.475
- Uh, what's it?
- You know, at the home.

31:29.571 --> 31:30.627
Well, what makes you
think that I...

31:30.659 --> 31:31.587
Oh, just cut the shit.

31:31.619 --> 31:33.379
No, do I look familiar to you?

31:33.411 --> 31:34.884
People do say I have
one of those faces.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.291
It was a long time ago.
I was...

31:36.323 --> 31:37.315
What are you fucking
talking about?

31:37.347 --> 31:38.468
This is fucking pointless.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.323
- Yes, practically, yes.
- "Practically."

31:40.355 --> 31:43.235
What, you think he was one of
those thugs that abused kids?

31:44.099 --> 31:46.755
So all of this is some kind
of fucking grudge?

31:48.068 --> 31:50.116
I hope you got raped.

32:26.243 --> 32:27.588
I need to go to the...

32:31.268 --> 32:32.931
Can't hear.
Open up.

32:33.476 --> 32:34.979
What's that, Hoaggie?

32:35.939 --> 32:37.475
I need to go to the toilet.

32:37.602 --> 32:38.948
You go on the side
of the road.

32:39.651 --> 32:40.675
There's no paper.

32:40.707 --> 32:41.699
We'll get you paper.

32:41.731 --> 32:43.011
I'll shit myself.

32:44.322 --> 32:45.507
So shit yourself.

32:48.548 --> 32:51.428
Well, I guess if you're happy
living with the stench...

33:11.620 --> 33:12.580
Go on, then.

34:05.475 --> 34:06.755
You going far?

34:07.524 --> 34:09.092
Oh, never far enough, mate.

34:26.724 --> 34:29.444
Those homes were no kind
of a place for kids.

34:32.355 --> 34:34.116
No one deserves...

34:40.610 --> 34:42.275
No one deserves that.

35:08.419 --> 35:10.115
Where did you leave them?

35:13.476 --> 35:15.428
My boys.
Where did you leave them?

35:17.188 --> 35:19.395
You shouldn't have left them
out there alone.

36:02.691 --> 36:04.292
Bit of a rough one.

36:25.283 --> 36:26.499
Safe travels.

36:26.628 --> 36:29.348
You're, uh, out of
toilet paper in there.

36:30.083 --> 36:30.947
Thanks.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.028
You been in the war
since this morning?

36:34.404 --> 36:37.155
I was a bit too keen
to get off the track

36:37.188 --> 36:39.876
and I tripped on a bloody root.

36:39.908 --> 36:41.411
It's not... not so bad.

36:41.442 --> 36:42.563
No.

36:48.260 --> 36:49.252
Try again.

36:52.484 --> 36:53.444
That's not what happened,
Hoaggie.

36:53.475 --> 36:54.915
Tell him what happened.

36:55.972 --> 36:56.932
Go on.

37:01.059 --> 37:02.115
- Go on.
- I, uh...

37:04.995 --> 37:06.306
I got a fright.

37:06.402 --> 37:07.875
I was frightened by...

37:08.676 --> 37:09.764
By a goat.

37:13.091 --> 37:14.372
Fell down the bank.

37:16.548 --> 37:18.179
Bit embarrassed, really.

37:32.995 --> 37:33.860
What's going on?

37:33.891 --> 37:35.780
I just hit my arm.

37:35.811 --> 37:37.476
Get in the fucking car,
Hoaggie.

38:11.716 --> 38:12.899
Smokes.

38:32.900 --> 38:33.892
What's he...

38:41.859 --> 38:42.819
Ahh!

38:52.132 --> 38:53.187
Oh, God.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.171
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

39:59.203 --> 39:59.683
Go!

39:59.715 --> 40:00.548
Go!

40:02.083 --> 40:03.043
You little cunt!

40:29.091 --> 40:30.051
Come on.

40:30.179 --> 40:31.139
Come on.

40:35.235 --> 40:37.059
Come on. Come on.

40:37.827 --> 40:38.787
Come on.

40:43.044 --> 40:44.195
Ah!

41:16.515 --> 41:17.475
Help!

41:20.259 --> 41:21.219
Ahh!

41:27.939 --> 41:28.868
No!
No!

41:28.899 --> 41:30.563
No!
Ah!

42:19.619 --> 42:21.763
Would you be so kind
as to pass that to Hoaggie?

42:33.059 --> 42:34.723
Go on and pin it
to your shirt, Hoaggie.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.011
My husband didn't do
those things.

42:46.499 --> 42:47.587
My husband wasn't one of them.

42:47.619 --> 42:49.091
One of who?

42:49.635 --> 42:50.980
- What?
- One of those...

42:51.011 --> 42:52.259
- One of the bad men?
- Yeah.

42:52.292 --> 42:54.116
- Oh, yes, he's a good man.
- Yeah.

42:54.147 --> 42:55.811
- You married a good man.
- Yes, I did.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.283
- Good father you've chosen.
- Yes.

42:57.315 --> 42:59.203
- Jill, he's just trying to...
- Yes, yes, you sick fuck!

42:59.235 --> 43:02.563
OK, clearly, clearly you've
got an issue with me, yeah?

43:02.595 --> 43:04.131
You've got some idea about me.
And that's fine.

43:04.164 --> 43:04.899
You can do whatever
you want to me.

43:04.932 --> 43:07.235
But just... please
just let her go.

43:07.331 --> 43:09.283
She hasn't done
anything to you, right?

43:09.315 --> 43:10.499
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

43:10.531 --> 43:11.652
You can let her go.

43:11.683 --> 43:13.123
You can tie her up and leave
her on the side of the road.

43:13.155 --> 43:14.211
And I will play along.

43:14.243 --> 43:15.684
I will be whatever
you want me to be.

43:15.716 --> 43:17.539
- But just please let her go.
- Alan.

43:17.571 --> 43:18.787
No, no, no, no, no, look.

43:18.820 --> 43:20.099
You've got me.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.763
Right?
You found me.

43:22.212 --> 43:24.132
She hasn't done anything.

43:25.316 --> 43:27.491
Didn't find you.
Weren't looking for you.

43:28.483 --> 43:31.363
No, I mean,
this is business as usual.

43:31.460 --> 43:32.355
It's the next meal.

43:32.387 --> 43:35.267
It's the next car, isn't it,
Tubs, you know?

43:35.300 --> 43:37.187
It's just a happy coincidence.

43:41.091 --> 43:42.211
And there's a whole
other scenario

43:42.243 --> 43:44.163
where a couple of backpackers
go missing and Tubs and I

43:44.196 --> 43:45.635
and I get to go to bed early.

44:16.515 --> 44:17.443
Hey, hey, hey.

44:17.475 --> 44:18.435
Get the fuck out.

44:19.044 --> 44:19.972
Get out!

44:20.004 --> 44:20.932
Jill!

44:20.964 --> 44:22.755
- You son of...
- Fuck off!

44:22.787 --> 44:23.715
No!

44:23.747 --> 44:24.707
Fuck off!

44:27.331 --> 44:28.612
Jill! Jill!

44:32.835 --> 44:33.795
Jill!

44:36.771 --> 44:37.731
Ahh!

44:47.459 --> 44:48.675
Now, don't get me wrong.

44:49.091 --> 44:50.243
I'll talk all night.

44:50.628 --> 44:52.548
But I suspect Tubs is
keen-as to get to a pub.

44:52.931 --> 44:53.732
Oh, that's fair enough.

44:53.764 --> 44:54.883
You don't ask for much,
do you, Tubs?

44:54.915 --> 44:56.484
- No, please.
- "No, please."

44:56.516 --> 44:57.219
- I...
- Fuck you!

44:57.252 --> 44:58.691
- Fuck you!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

44:58.723 --> 44:59.907
Language, please, Jill.

44:59.939 --> 45:01.220
"No, please," what,
Hoaggie?

45:01.252 --> 45:02.244
I don't know what...

45:02.276 --> 45:04.164
Hoaggie, you've gotta stop
stuttering here, mate.

45:04.196 --> 45:06.371
Sooner or later you gotta
make a clear, concise point.

45:06.403 --> 45:07.908
I don't know what
you want me to say!

45:08.004 --> 45:08.868
This is the funny thing, eh?

45:08.964 --> 45:10.723
You can't just teach people
what they need.

45:10.756 --> 45:14.467
No, no, no, you gotta lead
people to that realization.

45:14.596 --> 45:16.163
- Would you agree there, Jill?
- Please don't hurt her.

45:16.259 --> 45:17.155
Don't hurt her?

45:17.187 --> 45:18.532
Just don't hurt her.
I don't want you to...

45:18.564 --> 45:20.323
All right.
All right.

45:20.356 --> 45:22.116
I saw things.
Is that... Is that what you want?

45:22.147 --> 45:23.364
I was at the home.
I saw things.

45:23.396 --> 45:25.092
- Alan, don't!
- No, no, no, Jill.

45:25.123 --> 45:28.483
No, Jill, you need to
listen to Hoaggie right now.

45:28.580 --> 45:29.411
He's opening up to us.

45:29.443 --> 45:31.012
I don't know what
you want me to say!

45:31.044 --> 45:33.251
Well, you said
you saw things, mate.

45:33.283 --> 45:35.075
That's all a bit vague for me.

45:36.323 --> 45:38.211
Locker treatments!

45:38.243 --> 45:39.556
Locker treatments!

45:40.131 --> 45:41.604
The housemasters called them
"locker treatments."

45:41.636 --> 45:42.980
They would hold the kid's
head in the locker

45:43.011 --> 45:44.995
and they would beat them
with a leather belt.

45:45.027 --> 45:46.244
Tell Jill that.

45:46.404 --> 45:48.803
And then they would
put the kids in the cells

45:48.899 --> 45:51.011
and lock them in there
for days sometimes.

45:51.044 --> 45:52.675
And, and there was
a bloke who would

45:52.707 --> 45:54.403
make the boys fight each other.

45:54.435 --> 45:58.659
And there was a nightwatchman,
Ben Creely, he got fired for...

45:58.756 --> 45:59.619
for going into the boys beds.

45:59.651 --> 46:02.211
I don't want to talk about
a kid-fucker!

46:02.307 --> 46:03.684
Why did you bring him up?

46:03.716 --> 46:04.644
Did you fuck kids?

46:04.676 --> 46:05.411
No, no, no.

46:05.444 --> 46:06.596
Well, then why'd
you bring him up?!

46:06.629 --> 46:09.923
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want you to talk about you.

46:10.851 --> 46:11.619
They hit kids.

46:11.651 --> 46:13.891
You know, I saw guys
hitting kids

46:13.987 --> 46:15.620
with clipboards
when they were on-line.

46:15.651 --> 46:16.867
What's on-line, Hoaggie?

46:19.363 --> 46:20.419
What's on-line?

46:20.515 --> 46:24.163
It's a...
It was a...

46:24.323 --> 46:25.379
It was a procedure.

46:25.411 --> 46:27.075
It was... it was a roll call.

46:27.171 --> 46:28.931
You know,
they'd line the kids up

46:28.963 --> 46:31.236
on the... on the four-square
court, you know,

46:31.267 --> 46:32.035
the three lines.

46:32.067 --> 46:33.859
Did you ever
take the kids on-line?

46:33.891 --> 46:35.204
- No, I never.
- Are you sure about that?

46:35.236 --> 46:36.132
I was an assistant teacher.

46:36.164 --> 46:39.651
Are you absolutely sure
about that, Hoaggie?

46:47.844 --> 46:49.251
Yeah, there was one.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.099
There was one time.
Yeah, I wouldn't usually...

46:52.131 --> 46:53.987
I wouldn't usually,
but they were understaffed.

46:54.019 --> 46:56.803
And that they got me
to help with the roll call.

46:58.051 --> 46:59.524
Shit.

47:00.324 --> 47:01.156
Shit.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.395
There was...

47:08.579 --> 47:09.796
There was a boy.

47:11.844 --> 47:12.868
He would have been
about eight...

47:13.508 --> 47:17.091
Eight or nine years old
and he'd given himself a tattoo

47:17.123 --> 47:19.139
of a swastika on his arm.

47:19.556 --> 47:22.276
You know, on the
underside of his forearm.

47:22.308 --> 47:25.731
He'd... he'd done it himself
in his room with a needle

47:26.819 --> 47:28.036
and some pen ink.

47:29.828 --> 47:31.748
And one of the housemasters,
um...

47:33.507 --> 47:34.467
Freiberg.

47:35.331 --> 47:37.155
His name...
His name was Tim Freiberg.

47:38.211 --> 47:39.492
He had the kids on-line

47:39.524 --> 47:41.859
and the kid with
the tattoo was...

47:41.891 --> 47:44.067
he was small so he was
at the front of the line.

47:44.099 --> 47:46.979
And Freiberg saw the tattoo and
he got the kid to step forward.

47:47.011 --> 47:51.908
And he... he got one
of the other housemasters

47:51.940 --> 47:54.052
to go and get a wire brush.

47:56.004 --> 47:58.531
You know,
like the ones you use to

47:58.563 --> 48:01.668
scrub the grills
in the kitchen.

48:03.299 --> 48:05.283
And he handed the
wire brush to the kid

48:05.316 --> 48:07.075
he said, "Scrub that off."

48:07.107 --> 48:09.795
You know, "I want you to scrub
off that swastika tattoo."

48:11.779 --> 48:12.803
And the kid didn't
want to do it.

48:12.835 --> 48:14.020
He refused.

48:14.052 --> 48:17.411
And so... so... so Freiberg got
one of the young housemasters

48:17.443 --> 48:20.451
to hold the boy,
and he did it himself.

48:20.483 --> 48:22.371
He grabbed him by the arm
and he started...

48:22.403 --> 48:23.780
he started scrubbing
at the skin.

48:23.812 --> 48:27.043
And the... the boy was...

48:27.556 --> 48:30.147
the boy was screaming
and the other boys were crying.

48:30.179 --> 48:33.188
And Freiberg, he was scrubbing
and scrubbing him.

48:34.819 --> 48:38.819
And I... I just stood there
and watched.

48:39.555 --> 48:40.515
Hey.

48:42.627 --> 48:43.971
I just stood there...

48:46.756 --> 48:48.291
I mean, what could I do?
It wasn't my place.

48:48.387 --> 48:49.315
It wasn't my place.

48:49.347 --> 48:52.324
It just wasn't my place.
What could I have done?

48:52.356 --> 48:53.922
What could I have done?

48:58.276 --> 48:59.331
What could you have done?

48:59.428 --> 49:01.475
It was 30 fucking years ago.

49:02.020 --> 49:02.755
It's in the past.

49:02.787 --> 49:04.739
Let's just leave it
in the past.

49:07.587 --> 49:08.547
Jill...

49:23.811 --> 49:24.899
Good story.

49:30.116 --> 49:31.267
Visceral.

49:32.836 --> 49:35.171
You know, lots of details.

49:36.836 --> 49:39.042
That is the most important
thing about a story.

49:39.556 --> 49:41.187
It's the details.

49:45.411 --> 49:47.715
Except it wasn't a wire brush.
It was nylon.

49:49.284 --> 49:51.555
Still did the trick,
just took three times longer.

49:53.828 --> 49:55.235
See, you know what?

49:55.876 --> 49:59.459
It's the capacity to get
to the core things, Hoaggie,

49:59.492 --> 50:00.580
you know?

50:01.379 --> 50:03.299
Just strip away
that old self-deceit.

50:06.148 --> 50:07.268
It's what's important.

50:11.108 --> 50:12.195
All right. Look,
you got what you want.

50:12.228 --> 50:13.763
Just let her go, please.

50:15.619 --> 50:17.924
Please just...
just let her go.

50:17.955 --> 50:19.395
Let... Let her go.

50:21.251 --> 50:22.468
Let her go.

50:36.228 --> 50:37.892
Oh, look at those stars.

50:42.531 --> 50:43.812
I remember...

50:44.740 --> 50:46.628
Ah, years ago now...

50:48.771 --> 50:51.011
I spent a few weeks
out at Hokianga.

50:52.484 --> 50:55.300
Some nights
after we'd had a few,

50:55.395 --> 50:58.979
we'd take this little thingie
out into the water,

50:59.651 --> 51:03.171
sit there, talk,
watch the lights of Rawene

51:03.204 --> 51:07.780
down the harbor,
just smoking it up, you know?

51:08.931 --> 51:12.131
Lie back,
rocked by the swell.

51:19.332 --> 51:21.284
Always seems to me like the sky
is so much closer

51:21.315 --> 51:22.948
when you're out on the water.

52:29.219 --> 52:30.179
<i>Mom...</i>

52:44.355 --> 52:46.403
<i>Mom...</i>

53:21.796 --> 53:22.916
Jill...

54:23.300 --> 54:24.675
What do you think, Jill?

54:27.203 --> 54:28.963
Does it look any different
out there to you?

54:30.851 --> 54:32.803
From when you were coming up?

55:17.923 --> 55:19.843
I always knew
there was something.

55:24.772 --> 55:26.084
I could see it in your eyes.

55:26.115 --> 55:27.779
I could see you go back there.

55:33.795 --> 55:36.548
There is a difference between
doing something

55:36.579 --> 55:38.339
and letting it happen.

55:39.299 --> 55:40.835
There has to be.

55:46.148 --> 55:47.939
They live on
the same street though.

55:51.683 --> 55:53.315
Just wish you had told me.

56:05.348 --> 56:06.468
Satisfied?

56:08.932 --> 56:10.148
I'm getting there.

56:13.155 --> 56:14.948
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

56:21.955 --> 56:23.107
Jill!

56:23.203 --> 56:24.419
Jill, Jill, Jill.

56:28.931 --> 56:29.571
Get up.

56:34.275 --> 56:35.331
Jill, just get up!

56:35.683 --> 56:36.643
Ahh!

56:39.204 --> 56:40.483
Jill, just get up!

56:42.883 --> 56:43.971
<i>Get up.
Get up.</i>

56:46.211 --> 56:46.851
<i>Jill?</i>

57:24.676 --> 57:25.956
Don't, don't, don't
don't, don't!

57:53.476 --> 57:55.523
Well, she had spirit.
I'll give her that.

57:57.828 --> 57:59.459
I see why you married her.

58:38.531 --> 58:39.876
I mean, a...

58:40.483 --> 58:42.659
Even a good audiobook
wouldn't go amiss.

58:43.363 --> 58:44.483
Eh?

58:47.459 --> 58:48.643
Shit.

58:50.339 --> 58:52.515
"I ought to be like him,

58:52.548 --> 58:54.883
but I am rather
the fallen angel."

58:54.915 --> 58:57.092
You ever read
"Frankenstein," Hoaggie?

59:06.531 --> 59:10.115
Let me guess.
You identified with the Monster.

59:14.724 --> 59:16.259
Yeah, of course you did.

59:22.371 --> 59:24.931
You misunderstood the story,
you fucking idiot.

59:28.164 --> 59:29.699
I didn't make you.

59:32.579 --> 59:34.115
Oh, there we go.

59:43.299 --> 59:44.355
Aw, come on.

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:08.803
Aw, shit...

01:00:10.275 --> 01:00:11.235
Open the boot, mate.

01:00:16.995 --> 01:00:18.756
Maybe you should call the AA.

01:00:20.004 --> 01:00:21.539
Ugh...

01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:27.203
Oh!

01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:28.387
Ahh!

01:02:19.716 --> 01:02:20.804
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:21.796
<i>Good. You all right?</i>

01:02:21.828 --> 01:02:22.371
<i>Ah, yeah.
Everything is fine, mate.</i>

01:02:22.403 --> 01:02:24.547
<i>Went a bit tits-up, eh?</i>

01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:26.947
<i>Yeah, we got a spare.</i>

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.419
<i>Yeah, so good to go.</i>

01:02:28.516 --> 01:02:30.532
Yeah, well,
thanks for stopping, eh?

01:02:37.284 --> 01:02:38.435
Jesus!

01:02:44.932 --> 01:02:46.371
Fuck!

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.812
Jesus Christ...

01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:50.083
- Ahh!
- Tubs!

01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:01.859
Fucking fix it.
Fix it!

01:04:23.588 --> 01:04:24.580
Stop!

01:04:27.139 --> 01:04:28.099
Stop!

01:04:29.604 --> 01:04:31.075
Stop! Stop!

01:04:33.731 --> 01:04:34.691
Stop!

01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:42.627
There's two men.

01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:43.427
They've got a gun.
They...

01:04:43.459 --> 01:04:45.347
They killed...
They killed people.

01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:47.202
We gotta get out of here
straight away.

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:50.211
We need to get out of here.

01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:52.995
Do I look like
I'm fucking having a laugh?

01:04:53.219 --> 01:04:54.308
Fuck off!

01:04:55.811 --> 01:04:57.156
I don't have time...

01:04:57.444 --> 01:04:59.364
I don't have time for your
posturing bullshit, OK?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.899
You're a tough guy,
I get it.

01:05:00.932 --> 01:05:02.116
You've made your point.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.036
Now let me in the fucking car.

01:05:04.996 --> 01:05:06.692
Walk away.

01:05:14.307 --> 01:05:15.524
What the...
Oi, you!

01:05:15.684 --> 01:05:16.931
What the fuck?

01:05:18.531 --> 01:05:19.842
Get out of the car!

01:05:19.939 --> 01:05:20.963
Fucking get off...

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.180
Oi!

01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:28.739
Shit...

01:05:36.676 --> 01:05:37.987
Get in the car.

01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:40.292
- Get in the car!
- Come on.

01:05:42.979 --> 01:05:44.802
- Get in.
- Fuck.

01:05:57.764 --> 01:05:58.788
Evening.

01:05:59.299 --> 01:06:00.419
Oh, shit!

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.595
Drive, just drive.
Just drive.

01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:03.971
<i>Shut it off!</i>

01:06:05.348 --> 01:06:06.500
- That's one option.
- Go.

01:06:06.531 --> 01:06:07.907
- Shut the fuck up.
- Go.

01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:09.028
Go.
Just drive.

01:06:09.124 --> 01:06:10.948
- Shut up!
- Drive.

01:06:10.979 --> 01:06:12.771
Or you can hear me out.

01:06:17.124 --> 01:06:18.275
Hear me out.

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.660
<i>How many you got
in there, mate?</i>

01:06:22.755 --> 01:06:24.323
- What do you want?
- Just drive. Just drive.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:26.436
<i>Just dispensing a bit
of local justice, man.</i>

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:28.131
- Don't listen to him.
- <i>What's your name?</i>

01:06:28.163 --> 01:06:28.899
- No.
- Kynan.

01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:30.372
No, no, don't
talk to him, mate.

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:31.779
Just don't talk to him.

01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:33.059
<i>OK, Kynan.</i>

01:06:34.244 --> 01:06:35.586
<i>I mean, I don't have time
to spin you the whole yarn,</i>

01:06:35.619 --> 01:06:36.836
<i>but that's a bad, bad man</i>

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.244
<i>you got in the backseat
of your car there.</i>

01:06:38.276 --> 01:06:40.164
No, that's bullshit, man.
That's bullshit.

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:40.995
<i>You don't want to know
the kind of shit that happens</i>

01:06:41.028 --> 01:06:41.955
<i>to kids when
this guy is around.</i>

01:06:41.988 --> 01:06:43.844
I didn't do any of that.
I didn't do any of that!

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.379
Don't try and split hairs,
man.

01:06:45.411 --> 01:06:46.692
Me being in the
car with you here now

01:06:46.724 --> 01:06:48.227
is the only thing
keeping you alive.

01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:49.476
Oh, you don't give a shit
about these kids.

01:06:49.508 --> 01:06:50.532
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:52.228
Hey, you don't
know this man

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:53.571
- and you don't know what he's done.
- Just go.

01:06:53.604 --> 01:06:54.851
Just... just... just...
just go.

01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:56.899
Just drive,
you stupid fucking cunt.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:09.828
What's the best thing
to do here, Kynan?

01:07:11.588 --> 01:07:12.644
Stay in the car.

01:07:12.771 --> 01:07:14.211
Stay in the car.

01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:19.364
Boy, all you gotta do
is walk away.

01:07:27.779 --> 01:07:28.739
Shit...

01:07:46.755 --> 01:07:48.036
No, no, no, don't do this.

01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:49.251
Don't do this.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:50.916
Don't do this.

01:07:50.948 --> 01:07:52.068
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:07:52.164 --> 01:07:53.124
Don't do this.

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:54.402
Don't do this.

01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:56.195
Oh, no!

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:57.379
Don't do this.

01:07:58.499 --> 01:07:59.492
No.

01:08:16.196 --> 01:08:17.828
Thank you for your
understanding.

01:08:31.971 --> 01:08:32.932
No!

01:08:57.731 --> 01:08:58.691
Boom.

01:09:57.924 --> 01:09:59.428
Yeah, that's right.

01:10:00.579 --> 01:10:01.539
Good boy.

01:10:04.003 --> 01:10:05.219
I know you.

01:10:05.956 --> 01:10:09.892
Boy's home,
halfway house, prison.

01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.956
You feel at home in a cage.

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.924
Oh, you think
you're a free man, eh?

01:10:22.628 --> 01:10:24.419
Still on a leash, eh?

01:11:06.115 --> 01:11:07.587
One more stop.

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.211
Then pub.

01:13:19.524 --> 01:13:22.756
I spy with my little eye...

01:15:11.844 --> 01:15:13.347
Come on, old son.

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:15.396
Tubs will help you.

01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:44.835
What you doin'?

01:15:49.859 --> 01:15:50.819
<i>Eh?</i>

01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:54.915
<i>Fuck me.</i>

01:15:59.235 --> 01:16:00.195
Suit yourself.

01:16:03.523 --> 01:16:04.612
<i>All right, Hoaggie.</i>

01:16:05.091 --> 01:16:06.532
<i>Let's get you on-line.</i>

01:16:08.803 --> 01:16:10.307
<i>Ah, my head.</i>

01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:37.027
What are the chances,
you think,

01:17:39.043 --> 01:17:40.612
of us meeting like we did?

01:17:43.139 --> 01:17:45.059
Well, it's a small country,
mate.

01:17:47.107 --> 01:17:49.923
You took us in,
you spit us out at seventeen.

01:17:51.651 --> 01:17:53.315
Where do you think we go?

01:18:06.468 --> 01:18:08.707
Up until tonight,
I'd always...

01:18:10.404 --> 01:18:12.771
Always ask myself
why I didn't do something,

01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:15.779
why I was such a coward.

01:18:28.484 --> 01:18:31.171
It's not right, you know,
blaming it on cowardice.

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:37.571
Because the truth
of the matter is I just...

01:18:40.004 --> 01:18:41.731
I just thought you deserved it.

01:18:54.179 --> 01:18:55.364
I should have helped.

01:18:56.003 --> 01:18:57.316
<i>I should have helped you.</i>

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:02.467
<i>What do you mean,
you should have helped me?</i>

01:19:04.483 --> 01:19:05.988
Well, you...

01:19:08.004 --> 01:19:09.700
You-you...
You were the...

01:19:10.339 --> 01:19:11.363
You.

01:19:21.859 --> 01:19:23.907
If it wasn't me,
it was some other kid.

01:19:32.611 --> 01:19:34.275
<i>We're all the same to you.</i>

01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:37.027
You're all the same to us.

01:19:50.948 --> 01:19:51.908
Come on, now.

01:19:53.443 --> 01:19:55.972
No need to drag this out
any longer, you know?

01:20:34.851 --> 01:20:35.971
Ahh!

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.651
Where are you going,
Hoaggie?

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:01.859
You got me.

01:21:04.739 --> 01:21:06.402
None of you cunts
have got me, eh?

01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:08.355
None of yous, none of yous
have got me.

01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:10.371
Because I reckon it's...

01:21:17.219 --> 01:21:18.179
Ugh...

01:21:26.562 --> 01:21:27.491
Fuck off.

01:21:35.492 --> 01:21:36.676
Nearly done.

01:21:53.411 --> 01:21:56.322
Cheeky little bastard.
Cheeky old bastard, old fuck.

01:22:01.379 --> 01:22:03.396
Stuff... That's the stuff...

01:22:04.035 --> 01:22:05.795
Didn't you reckon...

01:22:43.716 --> 01:22:45.251
I hate this place.
