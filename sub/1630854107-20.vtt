00:07.440 --> 00:09.060
(pop music playing)
(indistinct chatter)

00:09.260 --> 00:11.820
You get a spot right up front,
all right?
Thanks.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.260
Okay, everyone.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.130
If I could have your attention.

00:15.330 --> 00:16.930
All right.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.270
Detective Grizz
is just wrapping up a case.

00:19.470 --> 00:22.170
He should be here any
minute now, all right?
KIDS: Aw.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.750
Okay? All right, thanks so much.

00:26.420 --> 00:29.020
Just give me one second, please.
Excuse me.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.350
Joe, what the hell are you...

00:34.550 --> 00:36.380
Aw, come on, man.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.080
There are kids here.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.750
What, man? I'm hydrating, okay?

00:39.950 --> 00:42.190
It's like a frigging sauna
in this thing.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.260
Put the head back on
and get out there.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.330
Isn't there some other type
of community service I could do?

00:47.530 --> 00:48.860
Sorry, pal,
you drew the short stick.

00:49.060 --> 00:51.860
You're Detective Grizz
for a whole month.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.500
I hate Detective Grizz.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.570
The suit is really itchy
and it smells. Bad.

00:57.770 --> 00:59.070
You should have thought of that
before you got a DUI.

00:59.270 --> 01:01.270
Now come on, let's go.

01:01.470 --> 01:02.660
All right, give me a minute.

01:03.690 --> 01:04.780
(sighs)

01:04.980 --> 01:06.100
(groans)

01:08.160 --> 01:10.700
What are you looking at?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.640
(sighs)

01:15.400 --> 01:17.770
(muttering)

01:25.310 --> 01:26.820
Okay, kids, gather around.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.640
There you go.
Okay, without further ado,

01:30.840 --> 01:33.210
please welcome Detective Grizz!

01:33.410 --> 01:34.410
JOE:
It's a... There's...

01:34.610 --> 01:36.040
In the w... in the woods...

01:36.240 --> 01:37.180
It was right there!

01:37.380 --> 01:38.910
There's a...
It's... in the woods.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.810
There's a dead body
in the woods!

01:41.010 --> 01:43.600
(kids screaming)
There's a dead body
in the woods!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.870
* *

02:19.600 --> 02:22.690
Wait, explain to me again.
He's a bear...

02:22.890 --> 02:24.760
That solves crimes, yeah.
Detective Grizz.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.430
Yeah, he shows up at schools,
teaches kids to...

02:27.630 --> 02:29.160
(gruffly): stay away from crime.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.560
Or else what-- he mauls them?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.570
Didn't you have Detective Grizz
when you were a kid?

02:33.770 --> 02:35.130
Nah, not where I grew up.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.700
Wait, so this dude
puts out forest fires too?
No.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.610
That's another bear.
What?

02:39.810 --> 02:40.610
How many bears they got working?

02:40.810 --> 02:42.680
No ID on the victim.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.580
First on the scene
saw her Navy tattoo,

02:44.780 --> 02:45.680
which is why
they called us.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.080
Well, McGee, they don't need us.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.080
They got Detective Grizz,
so he can solve it.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.780
Detective Grizz is too busy
puking his guts out.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.950
(coughing)

02:54.150 --> 02:56.590
Yeah, looks like the contents
of her coat fell out.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.390
PARKER: Anything interesting?

02:58.590 --> 03:00.630
Uh, a torn valet stub.

03:00.830 --> 03:01.990
Could be where she last parked.

03:02.190 --> 03:03.800
Valet company's number's
on the back.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.300
Run it down.
JIMMY: Sorry.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.000
Sorry, I'm late, I know.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.400
You oversleep, Jimmy?

03:09.600 --> 03:12.570
No, my car wouldn't start.
Again.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.140
No, not the Man Van.

03:14.340 --> 03:16.140
Yeah, the Man Van. In hindsight,

03:16.340 --> 03:17.440
not the best purchase.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.580
And to top it all off,

03:18.780 --> 03:21.350
the handle to my bag
finally broke.

03:21.550 --> 03:23.120
You know, my tools
spilled everywhere.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.450
I love this bag.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.980
Dr. Mallard gave it to me.

03:26.180 --> 03:27.650
Jimmy, why didn't you
fix all that stuff already?

03:27.850 --> 03:30.720
I'd love to, Nick,
but Victoria needs braces,

03:30.920 --> 03:33.230
and money's a little tight
at the moment.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.030
Tell me about it.
It's criminal.

03:35.230 --> 03:37.330
Speaking of. Our victim?

03:37.530 --> 03:39.230
Oh, right. Sorry.

03:39.430 --> 03:41.700
Well, uh, based on decomp,

03:41.900 --> 03:43.700
I would say that she's been here
for a couple days,

03:43.900 --> 03:45.570
which is gonna make
establishing a time of death,

03:45.770 --> 03:47.310
uh, challenging.

03:47.510 --> 03:48.340
What about cause?

03:48.540 --> 03:49.810
Also challenging.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.110
Got so many wounds here

03:51.310 --> 03:52.710
it's hard to tell
which ones were fatal.

03:52.910 --> 03:55.910
All in all, I'd say it's
gonna take some time.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.450
So we got nothing.
Yeah.

03:57.650 --> 03:58.980
Come on, guys,

03:59.180 --> 04:01.490
you're making me look bad
in front of Detective Grizz.

04:01.690 --> 04:02.690
KNIGHT:
Well, this might make you happy.

04:02.890 --> 04:04.560
Valet company gave me an address

04:04.760 --> 04:05.560
where the car was last parked.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.610
Where is it?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.560
Nice digs.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.960
You sure this
is the right place?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.130
Yeah.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.980
Came up registered
under a trust.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.670
Happy to help. Anytime.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.670
It was great meeting you.
Thank you.

04:20.870 --> 04:23.180
Take care. Thanks for your help.
Yep. Thanks.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.630
Ma'am.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.450
Can I help you?

04:27.650 --> 04:30.780
NCIS. Is, uh...

04:30.980 --> 04:32.490
is this your house, sir?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.920
No, this is Senator Grayson's
residence.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.620
I'm her chief of staff,
Douglas Pritchard.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.390
Uh, can I ask
what this is regarding?

04:39.590 --> 04:41.560
We'd like to have a word
with the senator.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.360
Well, she's just
finishing up a meeting,

04:43.560 --> 04:45.080
but if you care to wait inside.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.020
I'll tell the senator
you're here.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.740
This room is nicer
than my entire apartment.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.380
You know what I'm thinking,
don't you?

04:59.580 --> 05:01.030
That I have a crappy apartment?

05:01.930 --> 05:04.380
Senator. Dead body.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.120
We could be looking
at another, uh,

05:07.320 --> 05:09.240
Chappaquiddick-type dealio.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.310
Parker.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.260
That looks just like...

05:18.460 --> 05:19.630
Our victim, yeah.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.430
SELENA:
I take it you're here

05:21.630 --> 05:23.590
about Amanda?

05:24.450 --> 05:25.840
All right, what, uh

05:26.040 --> 05:28.160
what did my daughter
do this time?

05:30.830 --> 05:34.160
I'm sorry. Um...

05:35.860 --> 05:38.770
I'm afraid your daughter's dead.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.420
I can't believe she's gone.

05:58.450 --> 06:01.140
We're sorry
for your loss, senator.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.040
I always feared
this would happen.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.780
Amanda was a troubled person.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.160
How so?

06:10.570 --> 06:13.640
Well, she was self-destructive.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.710
Always acting out.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.360
Do either of you have children?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.900
No.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.410
You think running a government
is hard, try parenting.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.340
I guess it was my fault
that she was the way she was.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.610
Amanda probably needed

06:32.810 --> 06:37.260
more attention
than I could give.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.810
If I'd only
been there for her...

06:41.010 --> 06:43.350
Hey, hey. Don't do that
to yourself, Selena.

06:43.550 --> 06:46.200
You did everything
that you could.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.250
When did you see her last?

06:49.450 --> 06:51.120
Two weeks ago.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.740
I hosted a dinner.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.290
She just showed up.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.860
Did this dinner
have a valet service?
PRITCHARD: Yes.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.170
It-it was a fundraiser

07:00.370 --> 07:01.870
for the senator's
reelection campaign.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.200
And how did Amanda seem?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.300
Surprisingly upbeat.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.140
And then she just

07:07.340 --> 07:10.740
slipped back
to her old ways and...

07:10.940 --> 07:12.950
started drinking and

07:13.150 --> 07:15.380
became loud and belligerent.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.120
I tried to order her a car
to take her home,

07:17.320 --> 07:18.900
but she just ran off.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.710
That was the last time we spoke.
(sobs)

07:25.010 --> 07:26.430
Well, thank you, Senator.

07:26.630 --> 07:27.930
That's, uh, that's
enough for now.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.530
If we have any more questions,
we'll be in touch.

07:29.730 --> 07:31.930
You'll be in touch
sooner than that.

07:32.130 --> 07:33.370
I want to be updated

07:33.570 --> 07:35.670
on this investigation
every step of the way.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.440
That's normally

07:37.640 --> 07:38.800
not how we handle...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.110
My daughter was murdered,
Agent Parker.

07:41.310 --> 07:42.640
And I'm gonna use

07:42.840 --> 07:46.310
everything in my power
to catch the person responsible.

07:46.510 --> 07:49.570
Do you understand?

07:50.730 --> 07:52.640
Yes, ma'am.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.960
KNIGHT:
<i>When the senator</i>

07:57.160 --> 07:59.320
said that Amanda was troubled,
she was not kidding.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.760
I checked her record.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.560
Multiple DUIs, vandalism,
disturbing the peace,

08:03.760 --> 08:05.930
and all before her sweet 16.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.400
Teen delinquent.
I can relate.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.130
Though I doubt
she did time in juvie.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.940
Well, she was shipped
to Rosewood Center in Utah,

08:12.140 --> 08:15.040
which is like, uh, a boarding
school for troubled teens.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.440
And when that
didn't work

08:16.640 --> 08:17.840
her mom signed for her
to join the military

08:18.040 --> 08:19.110
as a last-ditch effort.

08:19.310 --> 08:20.350
I take it that
didn't work either?

08:20.550 --> 08:21.780
I talked to Amanda's CO.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.880
She recently got disciplined
for misconduct.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.120
Not her first time.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.380
It sounds like the Navy

08:26.590 --> 08:28.320
was planning on discharging her.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
So what was she mixed up in?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.090
I might have an answer.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.830
Looked into Amanda's finances.

08:33.030 --> 08:35.260
Turns out she was running
a side hustle.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.880
She was posting videos
to CurioCam.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.430
You say that like
I'm supposed to know

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
what you're talking about.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.240
It's an online
subscription service

08:45.440 --> 08:46.940
where people
record private videos

08:47.140 --> 08:48.270
for their subscribers.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.360
You know, sex videos,
kinky stuff.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.680
So I've heard.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.980
Uh-huh.
KNIGHT: There are a lot of

08:56.180 --> 08:57.720
shady characters on CurioCam,

08:57.920 --> 09:00.070
so she could have
met the wrong person online.

09:03.670 --> 09:04.520
JIMMY:
<i>I'm sorry, uh,</i>

09:04.720 --> 09:06.470
braces are how much?

09:07.410 --> 09:09.660
And that's for
the whole mouth, right?

09:09.860 --> 09:10.930
Okay, all right.

09:11.130 --> 09:12.730
Uh, let me see what
I can scrounge up

09:12.930 --> 09:14.700
and I-I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.200
Sorry, Director.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.240
Problems, Dr. Palmer?
No, no,

09:18.440 --> 09:20.440
I just...
Victoria needs braces.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.040
I'm learning they are
a tad expensive.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.040
Oh, yeah, I remember.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.440
When my kids needed braces,

09:25.640 --> 09:27.110
I practically had to
refinance the house.

09:27.310 --> 09:28.980
I am this close to telling her
just not to smile

09:29.180 --> 09:30.350
for the rest of her life.

09:30.550 --> 09:31.650
It'd be so much cheaper.

09:31.850 --> 09:33.450
(chuckles) So, how's
the autopsy coming?

09:33.650 --> 09:35.750
I've just about calculated
Amanda's time of death.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.690
I would have had it sooner,
but given the state of the body,

09:37.890 --> 09:39.520
it's taken longer
than I would have liked.

09:39.730 --> 09:40.990
Actually, that's why I'm here.

09:41.190 --> 09:42.230
Senator Grayson

09:42.430 --> 09:43.400
has been pushing
to get some answers

09:43.600 --> 09:44.700
as soon as possible,

09:44.900 --> 09:46.730
and she has now demanded
that we take on

09:46.930 --> 09:50.000
a forensic pathologist
to assist with the autopsy.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.440
Wow, I haven't worked
with anyone down here since, uh,

09:53.640 --> 09:55.370
well, since Dr. Mallard.
Yeah, and I understand

09:55.570 --> 09:57.910
it's an imposition,
but the senator's

09:58.110 --> 09:59.810
got SECNAV involved now,
so it's a...

10:00.010 --> 10:01.980
Uh, no, no, no,
it's fine, Director.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.050
Who's the pathologist?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.320
From what I hear,

10:04.520 --> 10:05.620
he's actually
quite accomplished.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.420
He's worked a lot
of high-profile cases,

10:07.620 --> 10:08.790
he's written several
bestselling books.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.790
He even has his
own docuseries.

10:10.990 --> 10:14.030
(elevator dings)
It's not Miles Bauer, is it?

10:14.230 --> 10:15.460
(laughs)

10:15.660 --> 10:17.700
Jimmy.
Can you believe this?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.400
How long's it been? Come here,
give me some love, man.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.300
Oh. Miles.
Yeah, nice to see you.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.640
VANCE:
So, wait, how do you... how do

10:23.840 --> 10:25.040
you two know each other?
Uh, we were pre-med

10:25.240 --> 10:26.370
together back in college.

10:26.570 --> 10:27.710
Oh, more than that.
We were roommates.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.510
This guy-- the smartest
guy on campus.

10:29.710 --> 10:30.510
And the horniest.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.210
(chuckles nervously)

10:32.410 --> 10:33.550
Nah, seriously,
you look good.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.610
(laughs)
You look good, too.

10:35.810 --> 10:37.320
Uh, congratulations

10:37.520 --> 10:39.150
on all your success, you know?
The...

10:39.350 --> 10:40.390
You've made a name for yourself.

10:40.590 --> 10:41.690
What, all the TV stuff? Nah.

10:41.890 --> 10:43.520
That's just Hollywood
phony-baloney.

10:43.720 --> 10:44.920
It's not like what you do here.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.890
Oh...
Getting justice
for fallen sailors?

10:47.090 --> 10:49.900
That's truly God's work, man.
So charitable.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.000
Well, it's...
I mean, it's not charity,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.530
it's actually my job.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.070
So, Dr. Bauer, I take it

10:55.270 --> 10:57.070
you're ready to start?
Yes, looking forward to it.

10:57.270 --> 10:58.100
And just so you know, Jimmy,

10:58.300 --> 10:59.440
as I told your director earlier,

10:59.640 --> 11:01.540
I'm here simply
to offer support. This is

11:01.740 --> 11:03.380
your house.
I'm just a guest.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.440
I appreciate that.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.510
So where are we?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.010
Time of death?
I was...

11:07.210 --> 11:08.580
Going off these numbers,
I'd say our victim

11:08.780 --> 11:09.880
died two days ago

11:10.080 --> 11:11.480
between the hours
of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.350
Just about to say that.
Excellent.

11:13.550 --> 11:15.250
This partnership
is working out already.

11:15.450 --> 11:16.550
Good.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.840
Good, let's get to work.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.160
NARRATOR:
With the gruesome discovery
of yet another victim...

11:23.360 --> 11:24.330
Hey, Kasie?
Shh.

11:24.530 --> 11:25.400
...San Antonio police

11:25.600 --> 11:27.470
turned to Dr. Bauer for help.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.200
In order to catch
the San Antonio Butcher,

11:29.400 --> 11:31.670
I knew I had to examine
his original victims.

11:31.870 --> 11:34.940
Every dead body
has a story to tell.

11:35.140 --> 11:36.610
You just need to listen.

11:36.810 --> 11:38.580
Man, he's good.
(video stops)

11:38.780 --> 11:40.280
So you've heard.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.710
Oh, I am so excited.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.520
I've read all
of Bauer's books.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.280
Have you gone down
to meet him yet?

11:45.480 --> 11:46.550
No, but I did work with him

11:46.750 --> 11:48.850
back in my FBI days.
Not a fan.

11:49.050 --> 11:49.790
What?

11:49.990 --> 11:51.060
Eh, I always thought Bauer

11:51.260 --> 11:53.630
was a blowhard
and a publicity chaser.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.230
He never met a camera
he didn't like.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.830
And good thing, too, because
his docuseries is amazing.

11:59.030 --> 12:00.970
Maybe he'll do one
about this case.

12:01.170 --> 12:03.740
How about we focus
on someone else's videos?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.740
Namely the ones
Amanda made, okay?

12:05.940 --> 12:07.770
I reviewed
all the footage

12:07.970 --> 12:09.240
in her
CurioCam account.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.310
There was a
lot of stuff.

12:10.510 --> 12:11.910
Over four
hours worth.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.310
Was it all explicit?

12:13.510 --> 12:15.860
Uh, not exactly.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.930
(soft rustling)

12:22.870 --> 12:24.190
What the hell am I looking at?

12:24.390 --> 12:25.590
(laughs)

12:25.790 --> 12:27.290
Amanda made ASMR videos,

12:27.490 --> 12:30.960
which stands for autonomous
sensory meridian response.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.200
People record themselves
making soft noises

12:34.400 --> 12:36.740
like chewing or whispering.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.340
It's designed to relax you.

12:39.540 --> 12:41.370
People pay for this crap?
Oh, yeah.

12:41.570 --> 12:42.780
It's big
on the web.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.180
Amanda had thousands
of dedicated subscribers.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.050
Oh, yeah? Any one stand out?
(video stops)

12:48.250 --> 12:49.250
One guy named

12:49.450 --> 12:50.380
Arthur Vernon.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.350
He watched every
video Amanda made

12:52.550 --> 12:53.750
and always left
a ton of comments.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.150
What kind of comments?

12:55.350 --> 12:57.110
The creepy kind.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.630
"I think about your
smell, your flesh.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.800
My soul burns for you."

13:03.000 --> 13:04.660
Hmm.
I know, right?

13:04.860 --> 13:06.200
All this from
bubble wrap.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.470
You got an address?

13:07.670 --> 13:09.570
(knocking)

13:09.770 --> 13:12.890
It's open. <i>Entrez vous.</i>

13:16.290 --> 13:18.110
(coughs)
Oh.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.230
Arthur Vernon?

13:21.300 --> 13:24.280
No, man.
Arthur's, like, not here.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.880
You his roommate?
Mm-hmm.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.050
I'm Agent Knight,
this is Agent Torres.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.570
Do you know when
Mr. Vernon will be home?

13:32.740 --> 13:34.230
Nope.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.710
(laughs)

13:40.480 --> 13:42.600
Hey, you all right
if we look around while we, uh,

13:42.800 --> 13:43.740
while we wait for him?

13:43.940 --> 13:45.340
Knock yourself
out, man.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.960
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

13:48.990 --> 13:50.240
Uh, which one is Vernon's room?

13:50.440 --> 13:51.510
Down the hall,

13:51.710 --> 13:54.260
to the left. Left.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.600
(laughs)

14:01.970 --> 14:04.110
We should arrest him
for just being a moron.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.800
Oh, wow.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.880
We have a stalker 101 over here.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.740
Our boy was
obsessed with Amanda.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.860
Obsessed enough to kill her?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.110
Is that...

14:27.310 --> 14:28.580
Amanda's scarf.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.630
Looks like he kept
a souvenir of her murder.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.290
Mr. Vernon.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.930
I understand how this looks.

14:44.130 --> 14:44.930
Yeah?

14:45.130 --> 14:47.030
How does it look?

14:47.230 --> 14:48.400
I know about Amanda.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.100
I didn't kill her.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.540
I was a fan of hers.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.670
We saw what was
inside your closet,

14:53.870 --> 14:54.840
Arthur,

14:55.040 --> 14:56.110
along with the comments

14:56.310 --> 14:57.580
that you left
on her video posts.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.340
This one is one
of my favorites.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.380
"You and I are
meant to be together,

15:01.580 --> 15:04.150
in this world
or the next."

15:04.350 --> 15:05.650
Poetic.

15:05.850 --> 15:07.290
ARTHUR:
I was interested in Amanda.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.420
That's not a crime.
Care to tell us

15:08.620 --> 15:10.090
how you got ahold of her scarf?

15:10.290 --> 15:11.220
She gave it to me.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.330
When?
Few weeks ago.

15:13.530 --> 15:14.730
I messaged her through the site

15:14.930 --> 15:16.160
and asked for
a piece of her clothing,

15:16.360 --> 15:17.530
so she sold it to me.

15:17.730 --> 15:19.000
You have any record
of this transaction?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.300
A receipt or...

15:20.500 --> 15:23.000
No, it's not really
tax deductible.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.590
I sent her cash.

15:26.350 --> 15:27.840
I'd like some more water.

15:28.040 --> 15:28.990
When we're done.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.280
McGEE:
Where you were two days ago

15:31.480 --> 15:33.400
between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.?

15:34.430 --> 15:36.480
I was at work.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.550
I'm a cashier
at the army surplus store.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.250
Anyone see you there?
My boss.

15:40.450 --> 15:43.060
He was there doing inventory.
You can ask him.

15:43.260 --> 15:44.160
Oh, we will.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.560
McGEE:
Army surplus store

15:45.760 --> 15:46.860
is only about a mile from where

15:47.060 --> 15:47.960
they found Amanda's body.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.260
That's convenient,

15:49.460 --> 15:50.300
don't you think?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.430
Are we almost finished here?

15:52.630 --> 15:53.970
It's getting pretty late.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.520
Have you ever been married?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.920
Arthur?

16:02.090 --> 16:03.280
Yes.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.740
We divorced.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.110
What happened?

16:06.310 --> 16:09.660
She get tired
of your sparkling personality?

16:14.200 --> 16:15.990
She, uh...

16:16.190 --> 16:17.420
she was unfaithful.

16:17.620 --> 16:18.720
Well, that must have
made you angry.

16:18.920 --> 16:19.960
Probably why she

16:20.160 --> 16:22.130
filed a restraining order
against you, huh?

16:22.330 --> 16:23.230
KNIGHT:
According to the reports,

16:23.430 --> 16:24.800
she said that you were abusive,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.330
and that you threatened
to kill her

16:26.530 --> 16:28.720
on multiple occasions.
She's a liar.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.170
If I'd ever lost my temper,

16:32.370 --> 16:35.310
believe me, she had it coming.

16:35.510 --> 16:36.690
Like Amanda had it coming?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.350
(door opens)

16:46.550 --> 16:48.220
So, what do you think--
is he our guy?

16:48.420 --> 16:49.590
Not sure yet.

16:49.790 --> 16:52.190
I mean, everything
about him screams guilty.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.530
He even gives me the creeps.

16:53.730 --> 16:55.160
But the evidence?
Circumstantial.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.730
We got nothing solid yet.

16:56.930 --> 16:58.410
Damn it.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.600
Senator Grayson caught
wind about Vernon.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.840
She won't stop
calling me.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.570
She's out for blood, huh?
Oh, yeah.

17:05.770 --> 17:06.870
She's pressing me
to make an arrest.

17:07.070 --> 17:09.410
Well, look,
I know she's a senator, but, uh,

17:09.610 --> 17:10.710
can't you tell her to back off?

17:10.910 --> 17:12.210
It's delicate.
Well, look,

17:12.410 --> 17:13.250
Leon, I'd love to help you out,

17:13.450 --> 17:15.010
but, uh, without any proof,

17:15.210 --> 17:16.610
we can hold Vernon for 24 hours,

17:16.810 --> 17:18.450
but after that,
we got to cut him loose.
All right.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.440
Let's just hope
we find something.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.460
Oh, uh, sorry. I was just
gonna check her liver.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.790
Oh, please.
Go ahead.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.460
Are you sure?
'Cause I can wait if...

17:27.660 --> 17:29.940
I insist. There's plenty
of organs to go around.

17:31.710 --> 17:35.130
Yeah, liver looks healthy.
No signs of steatosis.

17:35.330 --> 17:38.370
No steatosis.
Check.

17:38.570 --> 17:40.470
How long is he gonna
just stand there?

17:40.670 --> 17:42.410
Who? Kenji?

17:42.610 --> 17:43.910
Nah, don't mind him.
He's just here

17:44.110 --> 17:45.710
in case I ever want to
turn this into a book.

17:45.910 --> 17:48.210
He makes a mean cappuccino,
by the way. You want one?

17:48.410 --> 17:49.610
No, I don't.
Hey, Kenji,

17:49.810 --> 17:51.180
Could you whip up two
cappuccinos for us?

17:51.380 --> 17:52.480
Extra foam.
Mm-hmm.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.090
No, I don't need the... Kenji?

17:54.290 --> 17:56.570
Kenji? Kenji,
I... (groans)

17:58.310 --> 17:59.560
(sighs)

17:59.760 --> 18:02.460
Wish we had
that toxicology report.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.060
Kasie should have
it done by now.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.430
Sorry, she dropped it off
while you were in the bathroom.

18:06.630 --> 18:07.970
Don't bother reading it.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.040
Other than some vitamin B
and Rymodrin in her system,

18:11.240 --> 18:12.100
Amanda was clean.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.370
Rymodrin?

18:13.570 --> 18:14.940
She was taking
medication for ADHD?

18:15.140 --> 18:16.840
Not surprising.
Seems like everyone I know

18:17.040 --> 18:18.480
has been diagnosed with it
these days.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.740
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

18:19.940 --> 18:21.050
I've been waiting
for the report.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.280
I don't know.
Just slipped my mind.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.000
Wouldn't be the first time.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.050
Hey, Jimmy.
McGee.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.190
Hi. Have you met Dr. Bauer?

18:28.390 --> 18:29.850
No. No, nice to meet you.

18:30.050 --> 18:31.760
Yeah, same.
Listen, I hate
to rush you guys.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.490
We're kind of under the gun
on this one.

18:33.690 --> 18:34.660
Have you found anything?

18:34.860 --> 18:36.460
We determined Amanda's
cause of death

18:36.660 --> 18:38.160
was blunt force trauma
to the head,

18:38.360 --> 18:39.330
most likely from a rock

18:39.530 --> 18:40.830
swung by somebody
who's left-handed.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.030
Huh.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.170
Arthur Vernon
is left-handed, I think.

18:43.370 --> 18:44.670
Have you found any DNA?

18:44.870 --> 18:46.800
Not yet,
but we're still looking.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.940
Every dead body
has a story to tell.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.310
You just need to listen.

18:50.510 --> 18:52.080
All right!
You know it. Nice.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.480
(chuckling)

18:53.680 --> 18:55.650
What are these marks here?

18:55.850 --> 18:57.010
Uh, we don't know
what that is yet.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.880
Uh, it could be markings
from where the body

18:59.080 --> 18:59.920
hit the ground.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.020
Or maybe something

19:01.220 --> 19:02.720
was placed over her mouth?

19:02.920 --> 19:04.690
Of course.
How could I have been so stupid?

19:04.890 --> 19:06.590
I knew those marks
looked familiar.

19:06.790 --> 19:08.160
You've seen this before?

19:08.360 --> 19:10.760
I was working this case
years ago in Chicago.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.330
We caught this serial killer,

19:12.530 --> 19:13.470
real scumbag.

19:13.670 --> 19:14.870
He liked to put a mask

19:15.070 --> 19:17.000
over his victim's face
and asphyxiate them

19:17.200 --> 19:18.440
prior to stabbing them.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.210
Yeah, those are mask
impressions. I'm sure of it.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.140
So, her killer
placed a mask

19:23.340 --> 19:25.540
over Amanda's face
before killing her, huh?

19:25.740 --> 19:28.800
You find the mask,
you find the killer.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.420
I was wondering when you
guys were gonna show.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.090
Ever since the news broke
about Arthur,

19:35.290 --> 19:37.590
shop's been flooded
with reporters.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.890
Not that I mind.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.630
Good publicity.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.960
Uh, how long did
Mr. Vernon work here?

19:44.160 --> 19:45.130
Couple years.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.130
What impressions
do you have of him?

19:46.330 --> 19:47.230
You mean do I think

19:47.430 --> 19:48.700
he could have killed that girl?

19:48.900 --> 19:50.940
Heh, I can answer
that real easy.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.440
Hell yeah.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.310
He did it.
What makes you say that?

19:54.510 --> 19:56.270
Arthur was always an odd bird.

19:56.470 --> 19:58.580
You know, kept to himself,
got real sensitive

19:58.780 --> 20:00.310
if you ever touched
any of his stuff.

20:00.510 --> 20:02.850
But underneath, there was this

20:03.050 --> 20:04.320
anger simmering.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.080
Like a guy
who was ready to explode.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.450
And what about his alibi?

20:08.650 --> 20:10.120
Can you confirm that
he was working here

20:10.320 --> 20:12.460
three days ago between
the hours of 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.?

20:12.660 --> 20:14.430
I can confirm that I saw him

20:14.630 --> 20:15.790
for the 30 minutes
I was in the shop,

20:15.990 --> 20:17.600
but what he did
before and after,

20:17.800 --> 20:19.000
who knows?

20:19.200 --> 20:22.270
Okay, well, thank you.
We will be in touch.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.800
Hey, while you guys are here,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.240
you want to buy some
military stuff?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.470
We work with the military.

20:27.670 --> 20:28.570
Want to sell something then?

20:28.770 --> 20:30.260
(chuckles)

20:33.330 --> 20:35.910
Oh, yeah, that's
pretty bitching, right?

20:36.110 --> 20:38.380
Genuine World War II gas mask.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.750
A lot of guys are

20:40.950 --> 20:41.750
into this vintage stuff.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.390
Was Vernon into it?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.520
Well, now that you mention it,

20:45.720 --> 20:48.140
yeah, he was.

20:52.780 --> 20:54.270
You better not be going for

20:54.470 --> 20:55.500
the last jalapeño chips.

20:55.700 --> 20:56.630
What's that?
Oh, no.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.440
They are all yours.
Oh, okay.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.600
Well, what's up?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.770
Shouldn't you
be downstairs

21:00.970 --> 21:03.610
with Dr. Bauer, melding minds?

21:03.810 --> 21:06.010
Oh, no, I just needed a break.
What's going on?

21:06.210 --> 21:07.880
You two not playing nice?
I heard you were, like,

21:08.080 --> 21:10.250
friends in college.
Uh,

21:10.450 --> 21:12.150
not... not exactly.

21:12.350 --> 21:13.490
I know this face.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.090
There's something going on
between you two.

21:15.290 --> 21:16.790
(laughs)
Jimmy.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.660
I'm gonna get it out of you
one way or another.

21:18.860 --> 21:19.790
Okay, all right, okay.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.490
It's not that big of a deal.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.430
Back in college,
when we were roommates,

21:23.630 --> 21:25.800
I was kind of, like,
the star student, you know?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.230
And Miles was a screwup.

21:27.430 --> 21:30.100
He was always
turning in his assignments late,

21:30.300 --> 21:31.440
he was flunking tests.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.970
Miles Bauer was a screwup?

21:34.170 --> 21:35.610
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, without my help,

21:35.810 --> 21:37.680
he would have
failed out of school for sure.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.780
Okay, so
what happened?

21:38.980 --> 21:40.880
Was he ungrateful or...

21:41.080 --> 21:42.310
No, right before he graduated,

21:42.510 --> 21:44.720
the Mayo Clinic offered
this pre-med internship,

21:44.920 --> 21:46.050
and everybody wanted it.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.320
So, of course Miles
applied for it,

21:48.520 --> 21:51.220
but I was seen as, like,
the shoo-in for it.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.520
And the day before

21:52.720 --> 21:54.060
my interview,
the Mayo Clinic called

21:54.260 --> 21:55.690
to reschedule
the interview time.

21:55.890 --> 21:58.350
Miles took the message
'cause I wasn't home.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.400
I never got it.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.570
Oh, no...
You missed the interview?

22:03.770 --> 22:05.400
Mm-hmm.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.410
Yeah, Miles said he left a note

22:07.610 --> 22:09.290
right there, by the phone.

22:12.190 --> 22:13.960
I don't know.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.850
I always wondered if maybe

22:17.050 --> 22:19.170
he intentionally withheld it.

22:20.370 --> 22:21.850
But, either way,

22:22.050 --> 22:24.420
I didn't get the internship.
Miles did.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.320
The rest is history.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.060
That little weasel.

22:28.260 --> 22:30.260
I'm gonna go down there
and kick his ass.

22:30.460 --> 22:31.760
Whoa, whoa, Kasie. No, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.700
It's water under the bridge.
No, he s...

22:32.900 --> 22:34.270
he sabotaged you, Jimmy.

22:34.470 --> 22:36.430
I could never prove it,
all right? It's in the past.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.300
Honestly, I'm over it,
all right?

22:38.500 --> 22:40.570
So just...

22:40.770 --> 22:43.120
enjoy your potato chips.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.440
If you say so.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.580
Gosh.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.810
I don't know why I buy these.

22:50.010 --> 22:51.750
Mm. They always burn my mouth.

22:51.950 --> 22:54.350
They're jalapeño.
They're supposed to.

22:54.550 --> 22:55.620
Oh.

22:55.820 --> 22:57.370
I swear, these give me fevers.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.110
I got to go.

23:06.350 --> 23:08.800
VANCE:
<i>Time's up. It's been 24 hours.</i>

23:09.000 --> 23:10.700
Do we have enough
to arrest Vernon

23:10.900 --> 23:12.270
for the murder
of Amanda Grayson?

23:12.470 --> 23:13.570
Possibly.
I was hoping

23:13.770 --> 23:15.210
for something
a little more definitive.

23:15.410 --> 23:17.340
Well, Vernon's got motive
and his alibi is shaky,

23:17.540 --> 23:19.380
but we still haven't
got a smoking gun.

23:19.580 --> 23:22.350
But we do. We have the mask.

23:22.550 --> 23:23.880
I was able to compare
the gas masks

23:24.080 --> 23:25.450
sold at Vernon's employment

23:25.650 --> 23:27.550
with the imprints
on Amanda's face.

23:27.750 --> 23:28.920
They were a perfect match.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.520
That can't be a coincidence.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.220
Did we ever find a mask
at Vernon's apartment?

23:33.420 --> 23:34.430
No.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.030
Vernon could have easily
disposed of it

23:36.230 --> 23:38.160
after killing her, which
is exactly what the killer did

23:38.360 --> 23:40.470
on the case
I worked on years ago.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.900
I'm telling you, Director,

23:42.100 --> 23:43.170
all the facts point

23:43.370 --> 23:46.470
to Vernon being our guy.
It's case closed.

23:46.670 --> 23:47.740
Except it isn't.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.540
I've been going
over the numbers,

23:49.740 --> 23:50.680
and I hate to say it,

23:50.880 --> 23:52.680
but Arthur Vernon is innocent.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.850
What are you
talking about?

23:54.050 --> 23:55.510
Amanda's time of death--

23:55.710 --> 23:57.450
the 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. window
that we've been working with--

23:57.650 --> 24:00.120
is based on the assumption
that her body temperature

24:00.320 --> 24:02.090
was 98.6 at the time of death.

24:02.290 --> 24:05.790
Now, what happens if that
body temperature is higher?

24:05.990 --> 24:07.530
Say 102, 103?

24:07.730 --> 24:08.930
And how could that happen?

24:09.130 --> 24:10.660
Because Amanda was on Rymodrin,

24:10.860 --> 24:14.070
and when you combine Rymodrin
with intense physical exertion,

24:14.270 --> 24:16.000
like she certainly would have
experienced during her attack,

24:16.200 --> 24:18.540
it can cause a person's
body temperature to spike.

24:18.740 --> 24:21.710
So, if Amanda's actual
body temperature was higher,

24:21.910 --> 24:23.910
then that pushes back
her time of death

24:24.110 --> 24:27.310
by six hours,
11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

24:27.510 --> 24:28.310
which would mean...

24:28.510 --> 24:29.580
Vernon couldn't have done it.

24:29.780 --> 24:30.580
He was at
a doctor's appointment,

24:30.780 --> 24:32.220
had a rock-solid
alibi.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.350
With all due respect
to my colleague,

24:34.550 --> 24:35.420
this is just conjecture.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.250
Yes, elevated body temperature

24:37.450 --> 24:39.460
could be a possible
side effect of Rymodrin,

24:39.660 --> 24:42.790
but I have never come across it
in all my years of practice.

24:42.990 --> 24:45.960
And I have.
On a case I worked on.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.170
And just to be sure,

24:48.370 --> 24:49.870
I spoke with Amanda's doctor,
who told me that

24:50.070 --> 24:51.800
she was always complaining
of running hot.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.200
Her complaints
could mean nothing.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.270
Did her doctor verify it?
And this case of yours--

24:55.470 --> 24:56.640
what is it?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.540
What are the details?
I don't remember, exactly.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.810
It was a long time ago

25:00.010 --> 25:01.980
and I was an assistant.

25:02.180 --> 25:04.220
But I do remember
the part about the Rymodrin.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.820
So, let me get this straight.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.690
Your theory is based on

25:08.890 --> 25:10.220
some case you don't remember

25:10.420 --> 25:11.920
and weren't even the M.E. on?

25:12.120 --> 25:14.310
And you're gonna
believe him over me?

25:15.310 --> 25:18.050
I know I'm right, Director.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.550
Cut Vernon loose.

25:26.090 --> 25:27.610
No, this is a mistake.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.410
When the senator
learns you let a killer go...
The senator

25:29.610 --> 25:31.640
isn't in charge
of this investigation.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.260
I am, and I'm going with my man.

25:37.830 --> 25:40.400
If anything happens,
it's on you.

25:58.450 --> 25:59.840
Hope we did the right thing.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.310
Even if he didn't
kill Amanda,

26:01.510 --> 26:02.310
he's still
a creep.

26:02.510 --> 26:03.610
What's done is done.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.710
No use crying
over spilled suspects.

26:05.910 --> 26:08.430
Do you think he's innocent?

26:12.600 --> 26:14.590
What I think
is we need to get to work

26:14.790 --> 26:16.950
finding another suspect.
Any ideas?
McGEE: Maybe.

26:17.150 --> 26:19.790
I was going over
Amanda's phone records.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.960
Day before she died,
she made several calls

26:22.160 --> 26:23.960
to a classmate from
the Rosewood Center.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.860
Rosewood. That's the school
for troubled teens?

26:27.060 --> 26:28.600
Yeah.
Classmate may know something.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.930
Kind of a long shot but...

26:30.130 --> 26:32.620
Bring her in
first thing tomorrow.

26:36.590 --> 26:37.710
Oh.
Hey.

26:37.910 --> 26:39.190
Hey.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.360
What are you doing?

26:51.560 --> 26:53.320
Oh, so this is
how it works.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.360
I've always heard
that you guys

26:54.560 --> 26:55.560
have heart-to-hearts
in here.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.760
Is that what we're doing?

26:56.960 --> 26:57.930
We're doing a heart-to-heart?
Yep.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.430
About Arthur Vernon.

27:00.630 --> 27:03.530
Please, Jess, tell me you're
not taking Bauer's side on this.

27:03.740 --> 27:05.800
No, no, I am on your side.
Always.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.110
It's... I just want to make sure

27:08.310 --> 27:11.380
that your feelings about Bauer
aren't clouding your judgment.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.110
So you're not taking my side.

27:13.310 --> 27:15.510
Kasie told me what Bauer
did to you in college.

27:15.710 --> 27:16.980
And I told her,
I am completely over it.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.150
Are you?

27:18.350 --> 27:20.520
No, I lied.
It really pisses me off.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.990
But I'm not letting that
cloud my work, all right?

27:23.190 --> 27:26.290
Vernon is innocent,
and the facts are the facts.

27:26.490 --> 27:29.140
Okay. I believe you.

27:36.580 --> 27:38.640
You want to talk about it?

27:38.840 --> 27:40.940
It just doesn't seem fair.

27:41.140 --> 27:43.470
Guy like Bauer gets to
cheat his way to the top

27:43.670 --> 27:44.780
while the rest of us

27:44.980 --> 27:47.160
struggle just to keep
our heads above water.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.650
He gets TV shows,
he gets book deals.

27:51.850 --> 27:53.870
And what do I get?

27:54.640 --> 27:58.140
I get a broken-down van
and braces I can't afford.

28:00.310 --> 28:01.430
I'm sorry, Jess,

28:01.630 --> 28:03.230
I'm just throwing myself
a pity party here.

28:03.430 --> 28:04.960
No. No, no, no.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.810
Party away.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.650
I just sometimes wish
that things were easier.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.640
Yeah, I understand.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.520
It's tough right now.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.210
But...

28:19.410 --> 28:24.000
maybe try focusing
on what you do have.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.890
Thanks for coming in,
Ms. Lygnos.

28:31.090 --> 28:32.160
Yeah, of course.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.960
Um, I heard about
Amanda on the news.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.530
I-I still can't
believe it.

28:35.730 --> 28:36.930
I just saw her
a week ago.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.900
TORRES:
Were the two of you close?

28:39.100 --> 28:40.600
Not really.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.630
I mean, I hadn't
seen her since school,

28:42.830 --> 28:44.500
and we weren't even
that close then.

28:44.700 --> 28:45.800
Which is why it was so weird

28:46.000 --> 28:47.200
when she just
called me out of the blue

28:47.400 --> 28:48.340
and asked me to lunch.

28:48.540 --> 28:49.240
What did y'all
talk about?

28:49.440 --> 28:51.280
Rosewood, mostly.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.680
Before we met,

28:52.880 --> 28:54.150
she asked me to bring
all of my school photos.

28:54.350 --> 28:57.610
I was into photography
back then, and I used to

28:57.820 --> 28:59.750
go around taking photos
of everything.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.820
Any idea why Amanda
wanted to see these photos?

29:03.020 --> 29:04.590
A trip down memory lane or...

29:04.790 --> 29:06.760
No. I mean, to be honest,

29:06.960 --> 29:08.830
I was surprised she wanted
to relive Rosewood at all,

29:09.030 --> 29:11.250
given the rough time
she had there.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.710
What do you mean?

29:15.120 --> 29:18.140
Rosewood wasn't exactly
a summer camp.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.870
If you were there
it was because you had issues.

29:21.070 --> 29:23.310
Amanda seemed to have
more than most.

29:23.510 --> 29:26.080
She was withdrawn,

29:26.280 --> 29:28.380
anxious.

29:28.580 --> 29:31.100
I always felt bad for her.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.580
Okay, what happened
after this lunch?

29:33.780 --> 29:35.550
She wanted to keep the photos,

29:35.750 --> 29:37.120
and I gave them to her.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.820
We said our goodbyes.

29:39.020 --> 29:40.390
Then, a few days later,

29:40.590 --> 29:44.300
she called me, uh, but
by the time I called her back,

29:44.500 --> 29:46.950
she was already dead.

29:47.710 --> 29:49.070
(phone chirps)

29:49.270 --> 29:51.100
Excuse me.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.340
It's Parker.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.840
The police just found
another body.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.960
It's at the same park as before.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.130
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:04.970 --> 30:06.380
Lori Nelson, age 21.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.750
A jogger found her an hour ago,
called it in.

30:08.950 --> 30:10.150
KNIGHT:
I spoke with the local LEOs.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.190
They didn't know much.

30:11.390 --> 30:12.490
I ran a quick search on her.

30:12.690 --> 30:14.860
She posted videos
on CurioCam.

30:15.060 --> 30:17.390
Just like Amanda.
Anything on the body?

30:17.590 --> 30:19.330
It's a fresh kill.
Less than three hours old,

30:19.530 --> 30:21.600
and her head appears crushed.
Also like Amanda.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.540
PARKER:
Where's Arthur Vernon now?
Anyone got eyes on him?

30:24.740 --> 30:26.570
We sent agents to his
apartment and his workplace,

30:26.770 --> 30:28.510
and no one can find him.

30:28.710 --> 30:31.430
Vernon is in the wind.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.260
He didn't
waste any time, did he?

30:36.330 --> 30:37.680
SELENA:
<i>How could you let him go?</i>

30:37.880 --> 30:39.020
Senator, I understand...

30:39.220 --> 30:41.520
Because of you,
another woman is dead.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.020
This is unbelievable.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.560
We were acting on the best
evidence we had at the time...

30:44.760 --> 30:45.590
No, you were
acting on

30:45.790 --> 30:46.720
his evidence.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.990
Now, you could
have chosen

30:48.190 --> 30:49.890
to listen to Dr. Bauer,

30:50.090 --> 30:51.360
a highly-respected
pathologist,

30:51.560 --> 30:52.600
but instead,

30:52.800 --> 30:54.880
you went with him,
and he was wrong.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.770
I want him fired
immediately.

30:57.970 --> 30:58.940
Whoa, whoa. Hey...

30:59.140 --> 31:00.200
No one's getting fired.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.540
I made the call
to release Vernon,

31:01.740 --> 31:02.840
not Dr. Palmer.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.810
I don't care. I want him out!

31:05.010 --> 31:07.090
(clears throat)

31:07.860 --> 31:10.130
May I say something, please?

31:13.300 --> 31:17.200
I feel awful that
another woman was killed.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.390
But that doesn't necessarily
mean that Arthur Vernon did it.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.590
Oh, come on.
Jimmy. Really?

31:23.790 --> 31:24.860
After all this,
you're still

31:25.060 --> 31:26.660
gonna stick with
your Rymodrin theory?

31:26.860 --> 31:28.730
It's not a theory, it's fact.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.070
And I told you, it's nonsense.

31:30.270 --> 31:31.540
It goes against
all my experience.

31:31.740 --> 31:33.670
And, what, your experience
is more valid than mine?

31:33.870 --> 31:35.090
Do I really need to answer that?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.310
I am so sick of you throwing
your career in my face.

31:39.510 --> 31:42.480
You wouldn't even have a career
if it wasn't for me.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.710
This how you run your agency?

31:43.910 --> 31:45.770
Dr. Palmer.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.590
Go home.

31:53.790 --> 31:56.060
What? Are you firing me?

31:56.260 --> 31:58.030
No, I'm taking you
out of the line of fire.

31:58.230 --> 32:00.860
Go home, take a breath.

32:01.070 --> 32:02.400
PARKER:
He's right, Jimmy.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.820
We'll call you
when things cool off.

32:18.330 --> 32:21.620
SELENA:
Okay. Let's talk
about how you plan

32:21.820 --> 32:23.920
to catch this
lunatic Vernon.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.840
I imagine you have some
proposals on the table.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.070
Okay. Yeah.

32:39.270 --> 32:40.170
Yeah, I'll just-I'll just

32:40.370 --> 32:41.470
call you
back later.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.410
Bye.

32:43.610 --> 32:44.640
How's Jimmy doing?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.610
Uh, I don't know.
He says he's okay.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.450
But this morning, when
I went to his apartment

32:49.650 --> 32:51.020
to drop off his coffee,

32:51.220 --> 32:53.630
there were dirty dishes
in the sink from last night.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.490
Dirty dishes? Jimmy?

32:56.690 --> 32:58.320
Yeah, cleaning
is, like, his sport.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.390
I hope he's okay.

32:59.590 --> 33:01.090
Look, I know everybody's upset

33:01.290 --> 33:02.490
about Jimmy being benched,

33:02.690 --> 33:04.600
but the best thing
we can do for him

33:04.800 --> 33:05.760
is to catch Arthur Vernon

33:05.960 --> 33:08.370
and put this case
behind us, okay?

33:08.570 --> 33:09.370
So, where we at?

33:09.570 --> 33:10.800
BOLO's still out on Vernon.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.940
And we are monitoring
the borders and airports,

33:13.140 --> 33:13.940
but so far, nothing.

33:14.140 --> 33:15.010
All right, keep at it.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.520
He'll pop up sooner or later.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.010
What if we are wasting our time?

33:19.210 --> 33:20.410
What do you mean?

33:20.610 --> 33:22.580
What if Jimmy's right and
Vernon isn't our killer?

33:22.780 --> 33:24.650
I mean, think about it.
If he did kill Amanda,

33:24.850 --> 33:26.380
why would he go back
to the scene of the crime

33:26.580 --> 33:28.190
so soon and kill another person?

33:28.390 --> 33:29.590
It clearly implicates him.

33:29.790 --> 33:30.920
TORRES:
Yeah, that always did bug me.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.190
It's too obvious.

33:32.390 --> 33:33.560
Okay, I'll bite.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.790
But if it isn't Vernon,
then who is it?

33:34.990 --> 33:36.230
Well, after we met up with, uh,

33:36.430 --> 33:37.690
Amanda's classmate
from Rosewood,

33:37.890 --> 33:39.200
I went and did a little digging
on the school.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.700
Turns out they're currently

33:40.900 --> 33:42.930
under investigation
for allegations of sexual abuse.

33:43.130 --> 33:44.670
I haven't read
anything about that.

33:44.870 --> 33:46.870
Cause a high-priced law firm
is trying to cover it up.

33:47.070 --> 33:48.640
Amanda's classmate
said that Amanda

33:48.840 --> 33:50.610
was withdrawn and anxious.

33:50.810 --> 33:52.110
Could be signs she
was being abused.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.210
Maybe that's why she
wanted her school photos.

33:54.410 --> 33:55.550
She was looking for evidence

33:55.750 --> 33:57.310
to incriminate her abuser.

33:57.510 --> 33:59.680
Well, maybe she found it
and that's what got her killed.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.050
Only way we'll know for sure

34:01.250 --> 34:02.190
is to find out what
was in those photos.

34:02.390 --> 34:03.750
All right. McGee, Torres,

34:03.950 --> 34:06.090
search Amanda's apartment
for the photos.

34:06.290 --> 34:07.460
Knight, dig deeper

34:07.660 --> 34:09.160
into this law firm,

34:09.360 --> 34:11.100
find out who they're protecting.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.480
(phone ringing)

34:14.520 --> 34:15.970
And go for Bauer.

34:16.170 --> 34:18.140
Liz, hi, how are you?

34:18.340 --> 34:19.600
The book contract?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.740
I have a copy in my car.
Let me go look.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.270
And while I have you
on the phone,

34:23.470 --> 34:25.480
what do you think about
this for a new book title?

34:25.680 --> 34:27.040
<i>The Morgue the Merrier.</i>

34:27.240 --> 34:29.130
No, I know, I know.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.750
I don't see him anywhere.
I think he's gone.

34:33.950 --> 34:35.850
Okay, great.
Now-now get close to the body.

34:36.050 --> 34:38.690
Arthur Vernon is innocent,
but in order to prove it,

34:38.890 --> 34:40.690
I need to get a closer
look at Lori Nelson.

34:40.890 --> 34:42.790
Okay. If anyone
finds out I'm doing this,

34:42.990 --> 34:44.830
I'll be the one at home
eating Mallomars,

34:45.030 --> 34:47.360
which wouldn't be so bad,
come to think of it.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.470
Are you next to the body, Kasie?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.270
Yeah. Let's get this over with.

34:50.470 --> 34:52.340
All right, okay, so, so move
me closer, all right?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.370
And, um, you can
reverse the camera.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.410
Okay, just... Oh!

34:56.610 --> 34:58.440
Oh... Kasie?

34:58.640 --> 34:59.980
(groans)

35:00.180 --> 35:02.080
Ugh. Oh, God.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.110
Kasie? What happened?

35:03.310 --> 35:04.150
I can't see anything.

35:04.350 --> 35:05.520
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.150
Oh... (gags)
Wait, Kase?

35:07.350 --> 35:09.750
Ka.. I-I can't see anything.
What happened?

35:09.950 --> 35:11.890
(groaning)

35:12.090 --> 35:13.190
Kasie?

35:13.390 --> 35:14.890
Oh... Oh!

35:15.090 --> 35:17.840
Kasie. K-K...
W-What happened? I...

35:18.680 --> 35:21.030
Oh, gosh. Oh.

35:21.230 --> 35:22.470
Is everything okay?

35:22.670 --> 35:24.500
No. You're gonna buy me
a new phone after this.

35:24.700 --> 35:25.940
All right, all right, all right.

35:26.140 --> 35:29.270
I need to see a bruise
on her upper left arm.

35:29.470 --> 35:31.210
Can you move the camera
in closer

35:31.410 --> 35:32.590
and turn it around?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.050
What is that?

35:36.250 --> 35:37.610
I don't know.
I mean, the bruising

35:37.810 --> 35:39.020
could be from where
the killer grabbed her arm,

35:39.220 --> 35:40.820
but the white stuff...

35:41.020 --> 35:43.850
It looks like it's some sort of
skin cream that's dried out.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.060
Maybe she had
eczema or psoriasis?

35:46.260 --> 35:48.460
That's what I was thinking,
but her medical report

35:48.660 --> 35:50.190
says she didn't
have any skin conditions.

35:50.390 --> 35:52.280
Then whose skin cream is this?

35:53.550 --> 35:54.670
What are you doing in here?

35:54.870 --> 35:56.400
PARKER:
<i>Okay.</i>

35:56.600 --> 35:57.530
Hit me. What do we got?

35:57.730 --> 35:59.100
I dug into the
Rosewood scandal

35:59.300 --> 36:00.600
and, uh,
finally found

36:00.800 --> 36:03.510
who the law firm is protecting.

36:03.710 --> 36:04.980
PARKER: Hello.

36:05.180 --> 36:07.140
That's the guy we saw
at the senator's house.

36:07.340 --> 36:08.310
His name is Raylan Marsh.

36:08.510 --> 36:10.180
He is a Texas oil tycoon

36:10.380 --> 36:12.480
and one of the original
investors in Rosewood.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.050
Two former students
are accusing him

36:14.250 --> 36:15.190
of sexual abuse.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.650
Marsh is claiming that Rosewood

36:16.850 --> 36:18.460
is just one of his
hundreds of charities

36:18.660 --> 36:20.920
and that he's never even
stepped foot inside the school.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.790
But we know he's lying.
Why's that?

36:22.990 --> 36:25.600
Did you find the school photos
at Amanda's apartment?

36:25.800 --> 36:27.630
No, someone else
got to them first.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.800
But we found something better.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.140
The webmaster
at CurioCam contacted me

36:32.340 --> 36:34.610
about an outstanding bill
on Amanda's account.

36:34.810 --> 36:36.540
Turns out she was
paying for a separate

36:36.740 --> 36:38.010
cloud storage account

36:38.210 --> 36:40.140
where she kept digital copies
of the photos.

36:40.340 --> 36:41.850
She was gonna go public
with the photos.

36:42.050 --> 36:44.280
She was gonna post them
on her CurioCam page.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.080
The webmaster told you all this?

36:46.280 --> 36:48.070
No, Amanda did.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.290
My name is Amanda Grayson.

36:53.490 --> 36:55.190
Six years ago,

36:55.390 --> 36:58.080
when I was a student
at the Rosewood Center...

36:59.610 --> 37:01.280
...I was...

37:02.750 --> 37:05.890
...abused by Raylan Marsh.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.680
Over a period of several months,

37:11.880 --> 37:14.090
Raylan Marsh...

37:16.600 --> 37:19.100
...sexually assaulted me.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.920
And he's gonna say

37:22.120 --> 37:24.070
that it never happened,
and that he was never there.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.040
But these photos show the truth.

37:30.980 --> 37:34.300
If she had gone public
with this,

37:34.500 --> 37:35.970
that would have destroyed Marsh.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.030
He must have got wind of what
she was planning and killed her.

37:38.230 --> 37:40.340
And then framed one of her
obsessed fans to take the fall.

37:40.540 --> 37:41.840
Only Marsh isn't our killer.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.740
We found something suspicious

37:43.940 --> 37:45.780
when examining the body
of our latest victim.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.910
To be fair,
Jimmy was the one who found it,

37:48.110 --> 37:49.810
but he was right
to be suspicious.

37:50.010 --> 37:51.720
Are you now agreeing with him?

37:51.920 --> 37:53.620
What'd you find?
The killer wasn't

37:53.820 --> 37:54.850
wearing gloves
when he killed Lori Nelson.

37:55.050 --> 37:57.290
He grabbed her
and left behind a residue

37:57.490 --> 37:59.090
of his psoriasis medication.

37:59.290 --> 38:00.460
Luckily, it was
a rare prescription

38:00.660 --> 38:01.860
that needed to be compounded.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.990
I was able to trace
the prescription,

38:04.190 --> 38:06.980
and guess who it belonged to?

38:08.280 --> 38:10.320
(door closes)

38:11.650 --> 38:12.890
Senator.

38:13.890 --> 38:16.070
Oh, Agents Parker and Knight.

38:16.270 --> 38:17.510
I hope you're here to tell me

38:17.710 --> 38:19.730
that you've caught
Arthur Vernon.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.950
No, but we didn't need to,

38:22.150 --> 38:23.700
because he didn't
kill your daughter.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.620
You did.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.870
What?

38:27.630 --> 38:29.820
We found your prescription cream
on Lori Nelson's body.

38:30.020 --> 38:31.090
PARKER:
You got sloppy. You should have

38:31.290 --> 38:33.020
used gloves
like you did with Amanda.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.260
(scoffs)

38:34.460 --> 38:36.530
I have no idea what...

38:36.730 --> 38:38.330
Why would I kill Amanda?

38:38.530 --> 38:39.810
Because of Raylan Marsh.

38:41.050 --> 38:43.100
Amanda was going to expose him
for sexually abusing her.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.700
KNIGHT:
Marsh happens to be the single

38:44.900 --> 38:46.500
biggest donor
to the senator's campaign.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.310
He's practically bankrolling it.

38:48.510 --> 38:50.610
PARKER:
And if word got out
that the, uh, senator

38:50.810 --> 38:53.710
was being financed by the man
who molested her own daughter,

38:53.910 --> 38:56.300
then both of your careers
would be finished.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.020
Marsh abused my daughter?

39:00.220 --> 39:01.490
PARKER:
I'm sorry, senator.

39:01.690 --> 39:03.420
It happened to her
a long time ago at Rosewood,

39:03.620 --> 39:04.560
years ago.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.160
She hadn't
seen him since,

39:06.360 --> 39:07.960
until two weeks ago,
when Marsh showed up

39:08.160 --> 39:10.430
at your fundraiser dinner.
That's why she got so upset.

39:10.630 --> 39:12.060
KNIGHT:
Your daughter was
a troubled woman.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.460
But the last two weeks
of her life,

39:13.660 --> 39:14.900
she was trying to do good.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.230
She wanted to go
public about Marsh

39:16.430 --> 39:17.900
and show the world
who he really is.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.270
PARKER:
Unfortunately,

39:19.470 --> 39:20.700
she confronted Pritchard

39:20.900 --> 39:22.840
about it first, and he panicked

39:23.040 --> 39:25.080
and killed her.
And later, Lori Nelson.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.790
And framed both of the murders
on Arthur Vernon.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.510
PARKER:
I got to say,

39:30.710 --> 39:32.450
bringing in Dr. Bauer
to throw us off track?

39:32.650 --> 39:34.850
Genius move.
You played Bauer like a fiddle.

39:35.050 --> 39:36.350
Feeding him clues you knew

39:36.550 --> 39:37.390
that he would eat up.

39:37.590 --> 39:38.490
It was your idea to hire him

39:38.690 --> 39:40.090
in the first place, wasn't it?

39:40.290 --> 39:43.160
It was his idea.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.830
Selena, please.

39:45.030 --> 39:47.260
We were always
having to clean up her messes.

39:47.460 --> 39:51.230
I was only trying
to protect you, to protect us.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.190
(shouts)

39:56.160 --> 39:57.410
REPORTER:
<i>...where, earlier today,</i>

39:57.610 --> 39:59.480
Douglas Pritchard
was arrested for the murders

39:59.680 --> 40:00.680
of both Amanda Grayson

40:00.880 --> 40:02.180
and Lori Nelson.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.950
Sources tell us the arrest
was made with the help

40:04.150 --> 40:06.580
of famed pathologist
Dr. Miles Bauer.

40:06.780 --> 40:07.980
KASIE: What a load of bull.

40:08.180 --> 40:09.390
He gets all
the credit?

40:09.590 --> 40:10.990
Jimmy's the one
who broke the case.

40:11.190 --> 40:12.390
I am just happy to be back.

40:12.590 --> 40:14.960
And happy that we got
some justice for Amanda.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.090
Yeah, and thanks to her video,

40:16.290 --> 40:17.290
Raylan Marsh will be going away

40:17.490 --> 40:18.800
for a very long time.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.800
What ever happened to, uh,
Arthur Vernon, by the way?

40:21.000 --> 40:21.930
Oh, we finally found him.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.300
He was at his grandma's cabin,

40:23.500 --> 40:24.700
hiding out from the press.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.140
Oh. Dr. Bauer could
learn something from that.

40:27.340 --> 40:28.320
(elevator dings)

40:29.720 --> 40:30.870
Speaking of which...

40:31.070 --> 40:32.310
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:32.510 --> 40:33.510
I just, uh,

40:33.710 --> 40:34.980
came to get my stuff.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.180
Uh, know what,
I can come back.

40:37.380 --> 40:39.970
No. We...

40:40.830 --> 40:42.800
...were just leaving.

40:45.670 --> 40:46.790
You're packing it up, huh?

40:46.990 --> 40:48.860
Yeah, Vegas PD called.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.430
They need my help
with a double murder.

40:50.630 --> 40:53.000
Ooh, sounds juicy.
Yeah,

40:53.200 --> 40:54.500
it's nothing
like this one, though.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.770
This was one hell of a case.

40:55.970 --> 40:56.970
It'd make a great book.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.070
(chuckles)
I'm sure it would.

40:59.270 --> 41:01.240
Yeah, we could write it
together, if you're interested.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.220
I could speak to my publisher.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.530
I think that's more your thing,
you know? I'm good.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.100
Listen, Jimmy.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.360
I'm sorry if things
got weird between us.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.690
Oh, Miles, please.
It's all in the past.

41:22.890 --> 41:25.360
For what it's worth,

41:25.560 --> 41:28.210
you should know
I was always jealous of you.

41:29.650 --> 41:33.250
You were always the better one.
Still are.

41:35.190 --> 41:36.240
Heck,

41:36.440 --> 41:38.340
I know it couldn't
have been easy,

41:38.540 --> 41:40.510
watching our careers
take different paths, but...

41:40.710 --> 41:42.410
No, it wasn't, but...

41:42.610 --> 41:45.020
I'm-I'm glad things turned out
the way that they did.

41:45.220 --> 41:47.520
You know, if I'd taken
a different path,

41:47.720 --> 41:51.450
I would have never met Breena,
I wouldn't have Victoria.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.140
I certainly wouldn't have
my second family here.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.110
So, I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

42:00.350 --> 42:01.870
Take care of yourself, Jimmy.

42:02.070 --> 42:03.420
You too, Miles.
