00:06.173 --> 00:09.343
<i>- [Ihvon] What did you find?
- A prophecy
in the Old Tongue.</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:11.262
<i>Lanfear.
She's in our world again.</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:12.471
<i>Can we trust Lan?</i>

00:12.471 --> 00:13.597
Lanfear is famous for her

00:13.597 --> 00:14.598
mastery of Tel'aran'rhiod.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.392
<i>The World of Dreams.</i>

00:16.392 --> 00:17.476
Finally.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.145
<i>You want me to pretend</i>

00:19.145 --> 00:20.312
<i>to be in love with a Forsaken?</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:21.480
<i>This could be
our only chance</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:22.690
<i>to find out what he wants.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.316
<i>I won't let you hurt Mat.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:27.778
<i>You want me
to take away your curse?</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:29.071
Bring him to Cairhien.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.698
<i>Your son is dying,</i>

00:30.698 --> 00:32.992
<i>you've betrayed your sisters.</i>

00:32.992 --> 00:34.410
You're trying to justify
yourself to a woman

00:34.410 --> 00:35.369
you kidnapped.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.495
Black Ajah really exists.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.247
- Do something.
- I can't.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.336
Where's Egwene?

00:44.336 --> 00:46.255
<i>The western
shore is under attack.</i>

00:46.255 --> 00:48.215
<i>The Tower has sent
sisters to investigate.</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.760
You may need to go west to
track the ship's disappearances.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.136
Who are you?

00:52.136 --> 00:53.679
Ryma of the Yellow Ajah.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.890
Do you have any idea
what these Seanchan do

00:55.890 --> 00:57.057
<i>to women who can channel?</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:59.310
Collar her.
She must be tamed.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.355
How did you...

01:44.355 --> 01:46.106
You cannot hurt me.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.776
Any pain a sul'dam feels,

01:48.776 --> 01:50.861
her damane feels twice over.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.947
Even to death.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.032
Your first lesson.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.748
The second lesson.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.750
The a'dam cannot be removed.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.502
Not by you.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.763
I am Renna.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.557
What's your name?

02:25.563 --> 02:28.190
You know,

02:28.190 --> 02:32.027
many sul'dam disagree, but...

02:32.027 --> 02:34.363
I believe in
cultivating a friendship

02:34.363 --> 02:36.949
between sul'dam and damane.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.704
What's your name?

02:48.878 --> 02:52.172
I will have to hurt you
until you tell me,

02:52.172 --> 02:54.592
so...

02:54.592 --> 02:57.428
it would be easier
if you just told me.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.521
Egwene.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.900
Egwene.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.320
Ah, now that's almost nice.

03:15.571 --> 03:16.947
I see no reason not
to let you keep it.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.287
What is this place?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.584
Your home.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
Rest, Egwene.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.927
Soon, your training begins.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.259
So?

05:00.259 --> 05:03.721
Are you going to scream
and beg for your life?

05:03.721 --> 05:05.973
Try to seduce me?

05:07.516 --> 05:10.144
You knew this moment was
coming, so what's your game?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.729
What do you want, Lanfear?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.022
Oh.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.316
Not Selene anymore?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.403
You of all people should know

05:19.403 --> 05:21.739
the importance of
the name they choose,

05:21.739 --> 05:23.574
Lews Therin.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.536
I can't believe I trusted you...

05:29.329 --> 05:32.458
What makes you think
you can't trust me?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.462
Mmm.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.761
I've been protecting you,
you know,

05:43.761 --> 05:45.387
these past few months,

05:45.387 --> 05:47.973
keeping Ishamael
out of your dreams.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.814
I don't believe you.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.318
You know, this is just
what you did in your last life.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.029
You think it's so noble,
pushing everyone away.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.739
"Protecting the
people you love."

06:03.739 --> 06:05.074
You don't know
anything about me.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.161
Where are your friends, Rand?

06:10.746 --> 06:12.915
Perrin, Mat, Nynaeve?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.541
Egwene?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.377
You told them all you were dead.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.714
Oh, did you think
that protects them?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.592
It just makes them easier
for Ishamael to get to,

06:23.592 --> 06:26.720
and now he'll turn them to
the Dark so he can control you.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.055
They would never turn.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.141
I thought that too, once.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.147
And who do you trust
instead, hmm? Moiraine?

06:37.147 --> 06:39.399
The Aes Sedai who's done
nothing since you met her

06:39.399 --> 06:41.193
but try to deceive
and control you?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.778
Do you think it's a coincidence

06:42.778 --> 06:44.655
that you decided
to come to Cairhien,

06:44.655 --> 06:47.658
to the one place
she still holds influence?

06:47.658 --> 06:50.369
That it's a coincidence
Logain is there?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.539
She's had you
dancing on her strings

06:53.539 --> 06:54.873
this whole time.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.710
You know what?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.131
If you actually
want me to trust you...

07:04.091 --> 07:06.301
...then do something to earn it.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.554
Tell me where Ishamael is.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.015
Tell me what he's planning.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.603
Mmm. Well, look at that.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.273
There is a little Lews in there.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.113
But, if you actually
want to work with me...

07:27.823 --> 07:30.033
I have one condition.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.509
- What did she say?
- I have to go.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.511
Where? Did she tell you where...

07:49.511 --> 07:51.889
No. Away from you.
That was her condition.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.308
If she sees us together again,
she'll kill you.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.397
Logain.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.940
You moved him to
Cairhien, didn't you?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.108
So that I'd come here.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.693
Yes, of course.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.986
Away from the White Tower,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.404
where you'd never
be able to see him,

08:07.404 --> 08:09.406
where he'd never
be able teach you.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.036
Then I've stayed
too long already.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.579
She's a Forsaken, Rand.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.372
You cannot listen to her.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.720
Ah.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.474
Eh? Now I can see why
you wanted to come here.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.851
Mat...

08:37.851 --> 08:39.186
Wait, Mat.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.646
Yeah, I think this is a mistake.

08:40.646 --> 08:41.897
I think we should go.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.940
Aah!

08:42.940 --> 08:44.691
You worried
that I'm gonna find

08:44.691 --> 08:46.151
another bartender
to swoon after?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.362
I bet her stories aren't
half as good as yours.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.116
Give us some of that.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.247
Come on.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.456
Where are you going?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.791
Come on, Min.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.463
Come on!

09:11.510 --> 09:13.262
Please stop pacing.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.554
They'll hear us.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.974
I'm not pacing.
I'm investigating.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.142
Since we've been locked in an
attic by someone we don't know.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.520
By Ryma Sedai,
who is protecting us.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.646
You really think we should be
trusting Aes Sedai right now?

09:22.646 --> 09:24.147
I am not the one

09:24.147 --> 09:26.275
who got us into this situation.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.568
I barely shared a word
with Liandrin Sedai.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.820
You are the one who...

09:29.820 --> 09:31.071
I know perfectly
well what I did,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.781
Princess, which is why

09:32.781 --> 09:34.366
I'm going to make bloody
well sure that Aes Sedai

09:34.366 --> 09:35.534
and her Warder
aren't trying to...

09:37.911 --> 09:40.497
I can hear you two bickering
from the fruit market.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.751
It's all right, Basan.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.628
They've gone, for now.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.260
He tends to lecture.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.013
Elderberry.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.306
And astragalus.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.308
It's abundant in Tear,

09:59.308 --> 10:02.811
and was a favorite tonic
of mine as a child.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.814
That belt. You're a Wisdom.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.107
I am.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.734
So you know the drink
is a calming one.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.610
I'm hoping we can
have a reasonable

10:10.610 --> 10:12.195
conversation, Wisdom,

10:12.195 --> 10:15.907
about why two young women have
run away from the White Tower.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.246
You can trust me.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.665
The shelter of
the Aes Sedai sisterhood

10:23.665 --> 10:25.792
- promises it.
- Tell that to Liandrin.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.254
Liandrin Sedai?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.131
How is she a part of this?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.010
She's a Darkfriend.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.929
She's the one
who brought us here,

10:37.929 --> 10:40.057
turned us over
to those Seanchan.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.726
She broke the Three Oaths?

10:42.726 --> 10:45.062
Every single one.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.148
But that means...

10:52.361 --> 10:54.571
Black Ajah.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.616
It cannot be.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.667
If what you say is true...

11:09.086 --> 11:10.712
...then all of our sisters

11:10.712 --> 11:12.339
are in grave danger.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.107
Sorry I left you so long.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.153
First one's free.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.447
Try it again
and I'll flay you alive

11:37.447 --> 11:39.282
and feed you to your boy.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.325
How did you...

11:40.325 --> 11:42.119
I've visited your dreams.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.580
Mostly for my own entertainment.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
You have

11:47.040 --> 11:49.126
interesting fixations.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.839
Lady Lanfear...

11:53.839 --> 11:55.590
Ishamael said
he'd freed you, but I...

11:55.590 --> 11:56.883
Tell me, why do
you work for him?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.593
For Ishamael?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.013
You hate men.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.683
With one exception,

12:04.683 --> 12:06.101
it seems.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.687
- Oh.
- Please...

12:08.687 --> 12:10.897
What's his name?

12:13.150 --> 12:14.568
Aludran.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.446
Men hurt us...

12:18.488 --> 12:19.698
...betray us,

12:19.698 --> 12:22.159
and still, we love them.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.500
You swore your oaths
to keep him alive,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.252
but this is not life.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.424
I know.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.513
He's holding you back.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.396
The last tie to
the girl you used to be.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.193
The girl who was
beaten and starved,

12:56.193 --> 12:57.777
and forced to marry
before she bled.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.741
I know.

13:02.741 --> 13:06.411
And that's why I'm here,
to do what you can't.

13:06.411 --> 13:10.499
A gift only one woman
can give to another.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.755
No.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.257
No.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.805
You swore your oaths

13:25.805 --> 13:27.766
to the Dark, not to Ishamael.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.936
You cannot take them back.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.938
It's impossible.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.941
But there are many paths
to walk through the night.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.203
If we
count our wealth

13:48.203 --> 13:51.748
in damane, mine is higher
than Turak's, is it not?

13:53.458 --> 13:56.169
Oh, have you seen?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.838
My Ogier da'covale.

14:00.090 --> 14:04.427
Sing for us, Gardener.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.762
Show them.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.597
Treesinging is not...

14:07.597 --> 14:08.640
Sing!

14:12.978 --> 14:14.646
For us.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.240
I should
gift it to Turak.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.659
Can you imagine?

15:13.788 --> 15:15.874
Let's decide.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.917
How shall I gift it to him?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.094
What did you find out?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.472
Turak has a room of curiosities.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.265
The Horn's there.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.808
It's barely guarded.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.853
These Seanchan seem so bound
by their so-called honor,

15:36.853 --> 15:39.564
they don't even worry about
someone stealing it.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.067
But what of Egwene al'Vere?

15:42.067 --> 15:44.611
There's a place on
the outskirts of the...

15:48.406 --> 15:49.699
There's a place on the outskirts

15:49.699 --> 15:51.409
of the palace complex
where they keep the damane.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.371
There are far more guards there
than around the Horn itself.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.581
The Horn is
what matters, Builder.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.541
- We have to...
- We will find a way

15:58.541 --> 16:00.001
to get to her.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.045
Loial...

16:03.254 --> 16:04.589
...they call it "the kennels."

16:09.260 --> 16:11.638
There is steel

16:11.638 --> 16:14.933
underneath that sweet exterior.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.435
If anyone can
survive that place,

16:17.435 --> 16:19.270
<i>it's her.</i>

17:19.414 --> 17:21.499
Egwene.

17:23.293 --> 17:26.504
A damane cannot touch any object
she believes to be a weapon.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.886
Not while she wears the a'dam.

17:32.886 --> 17:37.056
You will wear this for
the rest of your life,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.683
however long that may be.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.781
It's hard, I'm sure,

17:52.781 --> 17:54.991
to have grown up thinking
that you were a person,

17:54.991 --> 17:58.912
only to realize that
you're a damane instead.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.042
But you cannot fight
what you are, Egwene.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.587
Now...

18:10.799 --> 18:13.426
Pour me a glass of water.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.741
We will do no more training

18:36.741 --> 18:38.993
until you can accomplish
this simple task.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.245
You must look at that pitcher

18:40.245 --> 18:42.497
and realize that you
can't hurt me with it,

18:42.497 --> 18:44.624
that you will never
be able to hurt me.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.835
Only then will you
be able touch it.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.721
You're strong.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.891
And spirited.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.898
I can feel your power
in the a'dam, even now.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.198
They say the strongest damane
are the hardest to break.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.085
I'll be back tomorrow.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.045
Sleep well,

19:31.045 --> 19:32.463
Egwene.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.032
Your gift
could have made you a prophet,

20:41.032 --> 20:43.868
rich beyond your wildest dreams.

20:43.868 --> 20:47.538
Instead, you're sleeping
with fleas and drunks.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.999
I brought Mat here,
like you ordered.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.960
- I've done my part.
- And now you want
your curse gone,

20:51.960 --> 20:53.544
just like that?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.713
That's how it works
when you make a deal.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.175
The Dragon is here, in Cairhien.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.885
Rand al'Thor.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.679
I think you've met.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.723
If you want to be free,

21:05.723 --> 21:07.558
make sure Mat leaves with him.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.605
You know what I saw,
the vision of Mat and Rand.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.358
- How did you...
- Do this last thing,

21:15.358 --> 21:17.902
and I promise you,
I'll take away your curse.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.697
And if I don't?

21:34.419 --> 21:37.338
Here's as good a place
to stop as any.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.090
I'm dying for some tea.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.185
This is a temple
to the Forsaken.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.605
Interesting choice.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.107
Shelter's shelter.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.406
We'll need
the Amyrlin's permission

22:03.406 --> 22:05.199
for me to return to the Tower.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.909
Moiraine's banishment
applies to me

22:06.909 --> 22:10.163
until our bond is formally
removed from Tower records.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.415
The Amyrlin won't be back
for another few days yet.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.667
She's returning from
a visit to Caemlyn.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.505
Forsaken.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.471
Do you believe they had powers
the Aes Sedai have lost?

22:27.597 --> 22:29.557
Weaves this Age has forgotten?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.559
They were the generals
of the Dark One's army.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.352
The things they did,

22:33.352 --> 22:36.064
our Aes Sedai would
never even consider.

22:36.064 --> 22:39.150
What you're
willing to do changes

22:39.150 --> 22:41.778
depending on what
you're faced with.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.174
It's rude to leave
while your friends

23:03.174 --> 23:04.884
are sleeping.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.889
Ruder still to use your weapon

23:09.889 --> 23:11.182
against them.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.686
I don't want to fight you.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.855
Rejection's a relatively
new experience.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.774
You'll have to
forgive me for asking,

23:19.774 --> 23:22.360
but...

23:22.360 --> 23:26.322
where are you going, old friend?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.366
That is my business.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.702
Blood feeds blood.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.955
Blood calls blood.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.123
Blood is,

23:35.123 --> 23:38.126
blood was,
and blood shall ever be.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.798
Answer
the question, Lan.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.466
Please.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.884
Do you actually believe...

23:46.884 --> 23:49.595
We don't know what to believe.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.514
Because you've told us nothing.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.976
You risk our lives,
Alanna's life, and why?

23:54.976 --> 23:57.228
We have always supported you.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.439
But if you are a Darkfriend,
sworn to Lanfear,

24:00.439 --> 24:02.775
you shall not leave this place.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.572
I've fought the Dark One.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.242
Move aside.

24:23.087 --> 24:26.340
The Amyrlin did not
banish you from Tar Valon.

24:27.592 --> 24:28.885
You know that.

24:29.886 --> 24:33.681
You wanted me to tell you
where she is. Why?

24:36.184 --> 24:37.894
I need to find her.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.897
What do you want
from Siuan Sanche?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.484
It's about Moiraine.

24:47.862 --> 24:52.325
You will tell us the truth,
al'Lan Mandragoran.

24:53.367 --> 24:56.370
We will kill you
were you stand if you don't.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.922
We found the Dragon Reborn.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.020
<i>You will kill...</i>

25:30.238 --> 25:31.656
<i>I killed them all.</i>

25:35.076 --> 25:36.369
No.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.349
This is
where you're headed.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.106
You know that, right?

26:05.106 --> 26:07.066
Men who can channel,

26:07.066 --> 26:09.110
they lose their minds.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.780
And eventually
kill everyone they love.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.701
Ishy, dear,

26:16.701 --> 26:17.910
if he doesn't
want you to be here,

26:17.910 --> 26:18.995
then you shouldn't be.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.461
I told you I was
protecting you from him.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.966
You have to be careful
in the Dream World, Rand.

26:31.966 --> 26:35.344
You can die here. Oh.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.013
And you can travel, too,

26:37.013 --> 26:38.973
see the world as it really is.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.019
See anyone you want.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.439
Talk to them, even.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.066
As if you were both awake.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.948
I thought about what you said,

26:55.948 --> 26:57.533
about the lies I told you,

26:57.533 --> 26:58.868
and you're right.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.204
I haven't given you
any reason to trust me.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.666
So let me start now.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.046
Let me give you
the gift of a dream.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.384
Is there anyone
you'd like to see?

27:22.933 --> 27:24.268
Anyone?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.732
Anyone.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.369
Egwene?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.456
Egwene?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.465
Egwene.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.886
Rand?

28:00.096 --> 28:01.597
What happened to you?

28:02.932 --> 28:03.974
Rand?

28:07.853 --> 28:09.563
Rand.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.316
Is that you?

28:19.490 --> 28:20.783
No.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.910
What happened to her?

28:22.910 --> 28:24.286
Where is she? She...

28:24.286 --> 28:26.539
She's supposed to be
at the White Tower.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.791
I know where she is.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.585
Please.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.672
Please, Lanfear... Selene.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.925
Please, if you
ever cared about me,

28:37.925 --> 28:40.344
just... please,

28:40.344 --> 28:42.012
just tell me where she is.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.433
Tell me!

28:49.854 --> 28:52.481
Ishamael has her.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.191
I told you he'd get them.

29:08.122 --> 29:10.040
I'll do anything.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.601
Rand?

29:35.316 --> 29:37.276
Pull yourself together.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.031
I'm losing it.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.908
Come on, come on.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.494
Pull yourself together.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.918
Hello?

29:53.918 --> 29:55.836
I can't hear you. Hello?

29:55.836 --> 29:57.463
Hello?

29:57.463 --> 30:00.799
Whatever hurt
the sul'dam feels,

30:00.799 --> 30:03.928
the damane feels twice over.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.429
Thank the Light.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.223
Do you know where we are?

30:08.557 --> 30:10.768
A damane
cannot touch anything

30:10.768 --> 30:13.437
she believes to be a weapon.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.439
No, no, we are not damane.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.610
Can you tell me
where we are? Please.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.781
What about your name?

30:28.786 --> 30:30.538
I'm Egwene.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.333
Whatever
hurt the sul'dam

30:34.333 --> 30:38.546
feels, the damane
feels twice over.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.778
Girls, I've just spoken to

31:02.778 --> 31:04.405
a ship's captain here I trust.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.282
He will take you to the Tower.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.410
News like this cannot
be trusted to a letter.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.787
You must go and tell
the Amyrlin Seat

31:11.787 --> 31:13.163
about Liandrin...

31:13.163 --> 31:14.123
Tell her yourself.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.207
I'm not leaving without Egwene.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.043
Basan and I will
stay here and do

31:18.043 --> 31:19.503
what we can
to rescue your friend.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.921
I'm not leaving.

31:22.339 --> 31:23.716
Ryma Sedai,

31:23.716 --> 31:26.260
I apologize, but I think
you've underestimated

31:26.260 --> 31:28.429
both this situation,
and the two of us.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.056
Neither Nynaeve or I
are leaving this city

31:31.056 --> 31:32.516
until Egwene is with us.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.233
Give it here.

31:55.664 --> 31:59.418
If you want to
rescue your friend,

31:59.418 --> 32:02.046
we have to work out
how to open this.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.126
Am I interrupting?

32:42.503 --> 32:44.463
I thought I'd bring
you a little something.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.507
Has Rand gone?
I made him one, too.

32:46.507 --> 32:47.675
He's gone for the evening,

32:47.675 --> 32:49.259
and I'm not hungry.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.719
It's just a little bite.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.722
Look, don't you remember?

32:53.722 --> 32:55.849
When I was a boy,

32:55.849 --> 32:57.893
you said that I made
the best sandwiches.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.770
I said it was because the butter

32:59.770 --> 33:01.021
was from a very special cow.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.107
Only it wasn't, of course.

33:03.107 --> 33:05.317
It's lucky, really,
because the cow would be

33:05.317 --> 33:07.069
long dead by now surely. I just

33:07.069 --> 33:08.487
buttered both sides
of the bread.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.155
You can
leave it there.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.869
Of course.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.872
I'm, um, I'm sorry
for intruding.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.637
You're right. As always.

33:36.265 --> 33:37.599
It was worth a try though.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.113
Sister, I haven't slept. I...

33:51.113 --> 33:53.615
Sometimes I wonder
how we all fell for it.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.534
My son worships you.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.578
As I worshipped you.
As father...

33:57.578 --> 33:58.662
Don't.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.958
He asked for you, you know.

34:04.001 --> 34:07.171
He was dying, and I was
there, holding his hand,

34:07.171 --> 34:10.382
and he just kept asking for you.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.967
We sent word to the White Tower.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.385
You knew that he was dying

34:13.385 --> 34:15.554
and that the only thing
he wanted was you.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.055
You knew.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.142
What was so important

34:20.142 --> 34:22.478
that you couldn't
come home and hold

34:22.478 --> 34:24.563
your own father's hand
while he left us?

34:25.856 --> 34:28.233
I know you never cared for me,

34:28.233 --> 34:30.194
but you loved him.

34:30.194 --> 34:33.238
You always loved him.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.742
What was so important, Moiraine?

34:47.795 --> 34:49.838
I want you out of this house

34:49.838 --> 34:53.050
and out of this city tomorrow.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.930
I am the eldest sister.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.723
I am the Damodred Heir,

34:59.723 --> 35:01.892
and this house is mine
if I want it.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.062
You and your son
are here by my good grace.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.233
You got none of what
made him good, Moiraine.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.235
None of it.

35:11.235 --> 35:13.403
You are mother,
through and through.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.033
Hold up!

36:11.670 --> 36:13.088
Who are you? Slow down!

36:14.631 --> 36:16.717
Halt! Halt!

36:17.718 --> 36:18.719
Halt!

36:31.648 --> 36:32.816
Lan?

36:34.359 --> 36:35.819
Leave us.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.114
Mother.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.033
What's happened? What is it?

36:42.576 --> 36:44.328
It's Moiraine.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.176
I knew you'd come back.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.387
I want you to teach me.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.308
Battle weaves. Whatever you used
to fight the Aes Sedai.

37:06.308 --> 37:10.771
I spent years working out
those weaves on my own,

37:10.771 --> 37:12.314
practicing and practicing.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.274
Why do you think I'd
just give it away?

37:14.274 --> 37:16.777
Because you want your life
to matter.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.740
You thought you were going
to save the world, or break it.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.828
But then the Aes Sedai
gentled you.

37:26.828 --> 37:31.041
And now your only chance
at making a difference...

37:32.167 --> 37:33.919
...is me.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.348
Embrace the Source.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.934
You know how to do that,
at least, don't you?

37:51.353 --> 37:52.980
You need to grab it.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.316
You're surrendering to it, boy.

37:56.316 --> 38:00.028
That's it. Make it yours.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.822
No more pretending,
no more hiding.

38:01.822 --> 38:03.532
If you want power, you take it.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.457
- Yes.
- Careful, boy,
don't take too much.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.793
- You could burn yourself out.
- Yes.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.629
Let go, boy,
it's too much.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.549
Stop! Stop!

38:28.682 --> 38:31.101
- There's not enough time.
- Time for what?

38:31.101 --> 38:33.478
To learn how to use it,
to be able to fight.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.816
With that much power,
you can do anything,

38:37.816 --> 38:40.318
fight anyone.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.823
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

38:44.823 --> 38:46.783
very much for bearing with me.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.744
I cannot imagine that's
very easy to part

38:48.744 --> 38:50.495
with all your money.

38:50.495 --> 38:54.291
So this time we are
going for all fours, yes.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.168
Hard eight. Right?

38:56.168 --> 38:57.294
We gotta see a hard eight

38:57.294 --> 38:59.087
right there in the middle
of the table.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.297
Come on, come on, come on.

39:00.297 --> 39:01.923
So, money in. Yeah.
Money in, please.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.884
All right, that is lovely, lovely.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.052
Anyone else? Thank you.

39:05.052 --> 39:08.680
So, we are going for
a hard eight, yes?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.558
Oh, God...

39:11.558 --> 39:12.976
Mat?

39:41.755 --> 39:44.758
What in Light's name are you
doing in Cairhien?

39:44.758 --> 39:48.053
What in Light's name
are you doing in Cairhien?

39:48.053 --> 39:49.262
And where is your hair?

39:49.262 --> 39:52.849
Mate, you look bloody awful.

39:52.849 --> 39:55.852
Wh-Where's everyone else?
Are they here? Where's...

39:55.852 --> 39:58.939
where's Perrin?

39:58.939 --> 40:00.565
Egwene.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.485
I, uh...

40:03.485 --> 40:07.364
Mat, it's complicated.

40:07.364 --> 40:10.450
It's a good thing I've got
nothing but time. All right.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.202
Now, this first round
is on you, given that

40:12.202 --> 40:13.912
you bollocksed up my roll.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.295
<i>Some of their damane</i>

40:22.295 --> 40:25.132
can sense when a woman
is channeling,

40:25.132 --> 40:28.051
so we have to be careful, and
never channel if they're near.

40:28.051 --> 40:31.096
Go ahead, but only a trickle.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.524
There's no latch,
no seam.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.902
I've never seen anything
like this. It's a ter'angreal.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.322
Like the Arches.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.074
Give it here a moment.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.869
You haven't told us
how you got these.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.665
At first, there were
only rumors.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.502
Far-off whispers
of strange beasts

41:02.502 --> 41:05.130
and channelers kept as slaves.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.091
The Amyrlin Seat sent us to
investigate these claims

41:08.091 --> 41:09.926
for the White Tower.

41:09.926 --> 41:13.221
Only after arriving in Falme
did we realize

41:13.221 --> 41:16.016
how grossly we had
underestimated the threat.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.143
These people intend to
bring the whole world

41:18.143 --> 41:20.937
under their empresses' control.

41:26.109 --> 41:29.362
Two were killed,
along with their Warders.

41:32.866 --> 41:34.951
And one was taken.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.163
- They collared an Aes Sedai.
- Not just an Aes Sedai.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.708
A Sitter of the Blue Ajah.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.628
You were close.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.802
My sisters and I
did not always agree,

41:52.802 --> 41:55.805
but there was no question
of our loyalty,

41:55.805 --> 41:58.225
to one another
and to our purpose.

42:00.769 --> 42:05.065
I only have this because
my sisters paid for it

42:05.065 --> 42:06.524
with their lives.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.171
You can't remove it.
You can't even touch it

42:28.171 --> 42:31.466
without unbelievable pain.
You know this.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.065
Do you want to know
who created the a'dam?

42:47.065 --> 42:48.275
A monster.

42:48.275 --> 42:50.944
She was a sister
of your White Tower.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.407
Aes Sedai don't have slaves.

42:57.951 --> 43:01.454
What did you do as a novice?

43:01.454 --> 43:04.374
They want to curb your power.
You know that.

43:04.374 --> 43:07.335
To waste your life
on parlor tricks.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.547
We Seanchan want you to
use your power

43:10.547 --> 43:12.173
to the fullest extent,

43:12.173 --> 43:14.384
the way you were born to.

43:14.384 --> 43:18.096
No woman can have power
with a collar on her neck.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.433
Oh, Egwene.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.980
You are not a woman.

43:29.065 --> 43:33.069
You are a damane,
and a powerful one.

43:33.069 --> 43:35.363
I hope they told you
at your White Tower

43:35.363 --> 43:38.158
just how special you are.

43:44.414 --> 43:45.957
Come with me.

44:18.365 --> 44:19.783
See?

44:19.783 --> 44:22.952
It feels better when we are
complete, doesn't it?

44:23.995 --> 44:26.831
Look to the tree, Egwene.

44:26.831 --> 44:29.042
I know it brings you comfort.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.507
Reach out to it.

44:35.507 --> 44:37.258
Search for its roots.

44:51.648 --> 44:53.608
You found them.

44:53.608 --> 44:58.446
Good. Now keep going,
through the roots

44:58.446 --> 45:01.658
into the flesh of the tree.

45:01.658 --> 45:04.661
Feel the sap running
through its branches.

45:04.661 --> 45:09.666
Let it grow warmer
and warmer in your mind.

45:09.666 --> 45:12.669
Make it so hot
it begins to steam.

45:13.878 --> 45:15.672
Now turn that steam into fire.

45:27.308 --> 45:30.687
Huh. That's how it's
supposed to feel.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.649
This is the power
we are meant to wield, Egwene.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.985
Did you feel it?

45:36.985 --> 45:38.361
Our affinity?

45:45.410 --> 45:48.037
Here, pour yourself some water.

45:48.037 --> 45:49.539
You deserve it.

46:01.843 --> 46:04.053
Pour the water, Egwene.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.529
If we don't find Egwene
before the ship captain leaves,

47:02.529 --> 47:04.155
you should go.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.241
Ryma's right.

47:06.241 --> 47:07.742
The Amyrlin needs to know
about Liandrin.

47:07.742 --> 47:09.327
And the three of us
will tell her.

47:09.327 --> 47:10.870
You have responsibilities.
For Light's sake,

47:10.870 --> 47:12.497
- you're the Daughter-Heir
of Andor.
- Oh, now that you

47:12.497 --> 47:15.458
have the chance to get rid of
me, now I'm the Daughter-Heir.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.919
Why are you risking everything
for someone you barely know?

47:20.880 --> 47:22.549
She's my friend.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.345
I've never had
one of those before.

47:31.599 --> 47:35.103
Come on, you gonna tell me
where the others are, or what?

47:35.103 --> 47:37.897
Last year, when I thought
I'd defeated the Dark One...

47:37.897 --> 47:41.276
Sorry, yeah, it's just
still crazy to me

47:41.276 --> 47:42.443
when you say things like that.

47:42.443 --> 47:43.736
I left...

47:43.736 --> 47:45.738
I left them behind.

47:45.738 --> 47:49.993
Egwene, Perrin, Nynaeve,
all of them.

47:49.993 --> 47:52.787
Mat, they think I'm dead.

47:54.330 --> 47:56.249
I thought it would protect them.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.668
I thought...
I don't know.

47:58.668 --> 48:01.087
I thought everyone would be

48:01.087 --> 48:03.756
better off without me, safer.

48:05.717 --> 48:07.135
No.

48:07.135 --> 48:09.178
We're not better off
without you, Rand.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.307
I promise you that.

48:12.307 --> 48:16.603
We're not better off
without you either, Mat.

48:21.941 --> 48:23.985
But now he has her.

48:23.985 --> 48:25.695
Ishamael.

48:25.695 --> 48:28.031
He has Egwene, in Falme.

48:28.031 --> 48:30.658
And I know they want me
to go there.

48:30.658 --> 48:35.622
But if I don't go,
what happens to her then?

48:36.873 --> 48:39.125
So, we go.

48:39.125 --> 48:41.377
But there's one thing
I've got to do first.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.630
A lady's heart
I've got to break, in fact.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.592
I will meet you at the gate
in an hour.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.302
Mat.

48:49.302 --> 48:51.346
You don't have to come with me.

48:51.346 --> 48:52.930
I mean it.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.599
Yes, I do.

48:54.599 --> 48:58.728
Who else is gonna keep you from
becoming an arrogant prick? Hmm?

49:00.021 --> 49:02.440
Dragon Reborn.

49:04.525 --> 49:05.610
An hour.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.155
I will be there.

49:29.050 --> 49:30.802
Mini-Min-Min.

49:30.802 --> 49:33.805
Min? You got company?

49:33.805 --> 49:35.848
Should I be jealous?

49:35.848 --> 49:38.518
- Min?
- Come in.

49:42.605 --> 49:45.608
Wow.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.276
Who pissed in your drink
and charged you twice?

49:48.319 --> 49:50.571
You know I'd only pay double
for the best.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.031
Hmm.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.574
And that is how
I'll remember you.

49:53.574 --> 49:57.203
Incredibly low standards,
but never for booze.

50:01.416 --> 50:02.834
Guess who I just ran into.

50:06.629 --> 50:08.005
My mate,

50:08.005 --> 50:10.299
who I've been telling you about.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.844
- He's here.
- You can't go.

50:15.471 --> 50:17.098
I haven't told you
that I'm leaving yet.

50:17.098 --> 50:18.683
I saw it.

50:20.935 --> 50:22.603
What?

50:23.604 --> 50:25.148
No. No, no, no, no, no.

50:25.148 --> 50:27.984
- I've already told you I...
- You kill him.

50:27.984 --> 50:29.986
You kill Rand.

50:32.405 --> 50:34.782
No. No.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.409
Yeah, with that dagger.

50:36.409 --> 50:38.202
- The ruby on the golden hilt.
- No.

50:38.202 --> 50:41.289
In Falme. That's where
he wants you to go, right?

50:41.289 --> 50:44.417
No. No.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.591
How do you know Rand?

50:57.346 --> 51:00.892
You. You set me up.

51:00.892 --> 51:02.560
- No.
- Yeah.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.228
- And that's why we're here.
- No.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.688
Because of him.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.941
I didn't mean to.
I didn't know that I...

51:08.941 --> 51:10.526
For how long?

51:10.526 --> 51:11.903
Since we left?

51:15.531 --> 51:16.991
Mm, no.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.411
Before we met.

51:23.289 --> 51:24.499
I'm sorry.

51:24.499 --> 51:29.128
I... I genuinely thought

51:29.128 --> 51:31.047
you were my friend.

51:32.632 --> 51:33.633
I am.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.929
I am. That's why
I'm telling you.

51:37.929 --> 51:39.597
You don't know what
this is costing me.

51:39.597 --> 51:43.893
You kill him, Mat.
If you love him, stay away.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.367
Ah, Jhonas.

51:59.367 --> 52:00.827
This letter needs
to be delivered

52:00.827 --> 52:02.829
to Anaiya Sedai,
of the Blue Ajah.

52:02.829 --> 52:04.831
She'll get it where
it needs to go.

52:04.831 --> 52:06.624
Of course, milady.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.718
Aunt Moiraine.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.974
Barthanes, I owe you an apology.

52:22.974 --> 52:25.434
The truth is I've been
a terrible visitor

52:25.434 --> 52:26.477
and a worse aunt.

52:28.062 --> 52:31.649
I do remember your
sandwiches were...

52:31.649 --> 52:34.402
and are very good.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.159
I think you'll make
a wonderful king, Barthanes.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.829
Kind and thoughtful.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.707
A king to make our house proud.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.719
Oh.

53:01.387 --> 53:05.391
The Amyrlin Seat is here,
in Cairhien,

53:05.391 --> 53:09.395
with 14 Aes Sedai, and she's
demanded an audience with you.

53:28.873 --> 53:32.084
The last time the Amyrlin Seat
called 14 sisters

53:32.084 --> 53:33.836
to meet with her in Cairhien,

53:33.836 --> 53:36.672
we installed a new king
on the Sun Throne.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.633
Well, maybe this Amyrlin is

53:38.633 --> 53:40.301
a little more frivolous daughter.

53:40.301 --> 53:42.428
Hmm.

53:42.428 --> 53:44.013
We'll have to wait and see.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.879
Alone it is.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.815
Lan.

54:37.692 --> 54:40.111
I'm sorry.

54:40.111 --> 54:42.196
I can't let you leave.

55:22.778 --> 55:26.782
Nynaeve, can you help us?
We need a little more power.

55:26.782 --> 55:29.785
But if one of us channels more,
they might feel it.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.960
I can't
control it like that.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.795
Don't think about it.

55:39.795 --> 55:41.964
It's the same as when
a patient comes to you.

55:41.964 --> 55:45.259
You don't have to decide
to help, you just help them.

55:59.648 --> 56:01.859
I-I didn't mean
to use so much.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.944
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's all right.
What did you feel?

56:03.944 --> 56:06.906
It needs to be healed.

56:06.906 --> 56:10.201
The only way it can be healed is
to be put on a woman.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.661
It's the only way
it'll be complete.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.371
It can't be broken.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.542
Basan. That means
the Damane have found us.

56:18.542 --> 56:20.669
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

56:20.669 --> 56:22.338
You'll do as I say.

56:22.338 --> 56:24.090
Do not expose yourselves.

56:24.090 --> 56:25.633
They have come to find
a channeler,

56:25.633 --> 56:26.717
and I will give them one.

56:26.717 --> 56:27.885
Ryma Sedai, no.

56:29.637 --> 56:31.722
Free our sisters.

56:38.479 --> 56:41.023
Can I trust you, Wisdom,

56:41.023 --> 56:42.483
to take my ring to the flame?

56:42.483 --> 56:43.692
You can't do this.

56:43.692 --> 56:46.028
Can I trust you, Nynaeve?

56:47.905 --> 56:49.573
Sister.

56:54.328 --> 56:55.496
Yes.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.233
Pour the water, Egwene.

57:24.233 --> 57:26.569
Aren't you thirsty?

57:51.802 --> 57:54.722
Pour the water, Egwene.

58:50.611 --> 58:52.154
Pour the water.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.717
Pour the water.

59:44.123 --> 59:47.626
- We have to help her.
- If we do, we can't
help Egwene.

59:51.714 --> 59:55.134
Nothing exists outside
this cell for you, Egwene.

59:55.134 --> 59:59.263
Nothing outside this door,
beyond these stones.

01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:03.600
Nothing except this pitcher
and my empty cup.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.443
- Do it.
- I can't.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:16.697
Don't let them take me.
Do it. Do it!

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:24.163
Basan!

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:25.998
My cup.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:28.459
That's the size of
your world, Egwene.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:30.669
That's it.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.005
No!

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:45.225
<i>Pour the water...
that's the size of your world...</i>

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:48.687
<i>that's the
size of your world...</i>

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.526
<i>Pour the water, Egwene.</i>

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:39.613
It will never
be a weapon.

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:43.325
You can never hurt me.
You will never leave me.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:47.287
Pour.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.012
Good girl.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:29.014
Don't cry.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:35.979
You lasted longer
than I did, child.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:41.818
And I was a Sitter
of the Blue Ajah.
