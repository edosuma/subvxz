WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:05.207
Guys, you know what
we should do tonight?

00:05.209 --> 00:06.675
See the new Zaliens movie!

00:06.677 --> 00:09.211
Oh, yeah! Zaliens 24:

00:09.213 --> 00:14.216
Zaliens vs. Cyborgs. They
said, "We'll be back,"

00:14.218 --> 00:15.350
And they are!

00:15.352 --> 00:16.752
Alien brain suck!

00:19.282 --> 00:21.523
I hear the first four hours
of the movie are really good.

00:21.525 --> 00:22.691
But then it gets kinda slow.

00:22.693 --> 00:25.260
But then the last
two hours are epic!

00:26.964 --> 00:29.231
You know what else
we could do tonight?

00:29.233 --> 00:31.733
Not waste nine hours of
our lives on that movie.

00:34.738 --> 00:36.338
Good morning, everybody!

00:36.340 --> 00:38.206
Isn't it a beautiful day?

00:38.208 --> 00:41.710
Hey, Dez! Good to
see you, buddy!

00:45.581 --> 00:49.317
Uh, dad, are you feeling okay?

00:49.319 --> 00:49.979
Yeah?

00:50.010 --> 00:52.621
- You're hugging Dez.
- I'm just happy.

00:52.623 --> 00:55.390
You don't seem like yourself.

00:55.392 --> 00:56.469
Maybe he's not himself.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.795
Maybe Zaliens replaced Lester
with a cyborg, like in the movie.

00:59.797 --> 01:02.531
Let's squirt water on him and
see if he short-circuits.

01:09.672 --> 01:11.239
Oh, Dez.

01:11.241 --> 01:13.642
Your shenanigans always
make me chuckle.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.710
They do?

01:15.712 --> 01:19.714
Well, I just came by to see where you
hung all the paintings I made for you,

01:19.716 --> 01:21.583
you know, of the giraffes
doing people stuff.

01:21.585 --> 01:26.421
Oh! Uh... We're still looking for
the perfect place to put them.

01:26.423 --> 01:29.758
Right now, we're keeping
them in that trash...

01:29.760 --> 01:34.329
Painting... storage...
container bucket.

01:34.331 --> 01:37.432
Wait, that trash can's a painting
storage container bucket?

01:37.434 --> 01:39.468
Ugh. I just threw a
banana peel in there.

01:39.470 --> 01:42.838
Anyhoo, I'm off to paint
some more giraffes.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.374
I've had this amazing surge
of creativity lately.

01:46.376 --> 01:48.677
Oh! You guys ordered a pizza.

01:49.812 --> 01:52.414
Let me get that for you.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.317
Extra 15 cents for you.

01:58.721 --> 02:01.423
Did he just pay for our pizza?

02:01.425 --> 02:03.458
He is not well.

02:04.694 --> 02:07.429
Wait a minute.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.297
Look at my dad's paintings.

02:09.299 --> 02:12.667
Giraffes sharing a milkshake.

02:12.669 --> 02:16.404
Giraffes cuddling in a gondola.

02:16.406 --> 02:17.772
Giraffes doing the tango!

02:17.774 --> 02:19.641
That actually looks
like the mambo.

02:19.643 --> 02:22.043
Are you sure? I
think it's a salsa.

02:22.045 --> 02:25.614
Guys, obviously,
my dad is in love.

02:25.616 --> 02:29.084
That's why he's painting
all this romantic stuff.

02:29.086 --> 02:31.553
He must be secretly dating.

02:31.555 --> 02:33.788
- Oh!
- Wow!

02:33.790 --> 02:35.891
Your dad is secretly dating...

02:35.893 --> 02:36.992
A giraffe?

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.982 --> 03:35.884
I can't believe my
dad is dating again.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.987
I should've put that together
when he bought cologne

03:38.989 --> 03:42.657
instead of rubbing a magazine ad all
over himself like he normally does.

03:42.659 --> 03:45.093
Hey, a free sample
is a free sample.

03:46.662 --> 03:50.765
I really want my dad to be happy, but
I guess I always held on to the hope

03:50.767 --> 03:53.568
that my parents might
get back together.

03:53.570 --> 03:56.438
I know exactly how you feel.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.729
I've always held on to
the hope that Zinga

03:58.741 --> 04:01.042
Juice would bring back
the pumpkin smoothie.

04:01.044 --> 04:05.880
But I have to come to terms with the fact
that it was for a limited time only.

04:05.882 --> 04:09.751
And that's a reality I have
to live with every day.

04:11.487 --> 04:14.522
Okay, guys, now that you've
practiced your song with me,

04:14.524 --> 04:16.558
Dez is gonna teach you how
to make a music video.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.466
That weirdo?

04:17.498 --> 04:21.096
Hey, the circus called.
They want their pants back.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.700
Mikey, that's not very nice.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.035
That's okay, Herman.

04:27.037 --> 04:30.438
I actually did get these
pants from a clown.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.607
Who's that kid?

04:32.609 --> 04:34.476
That's Mikey. He just signed up.

04:34.478 --> 04:36.077
He's a nightmare.

04:36.079 --> 04:36.799
I told you!

04:36.830 --> 04:39.681
I'm not going to listen to
you until you give me candy!

04:39.683 --> 04:42.617
Please tell me he's just
doing this one workshop

04:42.619 --> 04:44.486
and we only have to deal
with him for a week.

04:44.488 --> 04:48.556
Sorry. Mikey signed up for three months,
and I got all the money up front,

04:48.558 --> 04:50.558
and I already bought
this new jacket with it.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.527
- Okay, it's really cute.
- Yeah.

04:52.529 --> 04:54.696
I want candy!

04:54.698 --> 04:57.565
I want candy!

04:58.734 --> 05:01.636
Does anybody have some candy?
Anybody?

05:01.638 --> 05:05.140
I had some, but Mikey
took it from me.

05:05.142 --> 05:07.542
Oh! Look what I found
in my clown pants.

05:07.544 --> 05:08.510
Cotton candy.

05:08.512 --> 05:09.844
Here you go, you little monster.

05:10.846 --> 05:13.114
Look! I calmed him down.
Piece of cake.

05:13.116 --> 05:15.183
Now I want cake!

05:15.185 --> 05:17.485
Oh! I have a cream puff.

05:17.487 --> 05:20.255
I told you, I want cake!

05:25.661 --> 05:28.596
The first thing we have to do is decide
on a concept for our music video.

05:28.598 --> 05:30.899
Remember, there
are no bad ideas.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.667
Here's a concept!

05:32.669 --> 05:35.603
You're a fart bucket!

05:36.906 --> 05:41.843
Okay. Uh, like I said,
there are no bad ideas...

05:41.845 --> 05:43.778
But I am not writing
that one down.

05:43.780 --> 05:47.248
Whatever. You're
still a fart bucket.

05:47.250 --> 05:52.754
All right, well, why don't we see
what else you guys came up with.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.622
Oh.

05:54.624 --> 05:55.451
Ooh!

05:55.482 --> 05:58.760
"Dancing barefoot in
the sand." I like it.

05:58.762 --> 06:01.696
"Winter wonderland"? Brrr.

06:04.066 --> 06:05.600
Read it!

06:08.070 --> 06:11.106
"You're a fart bucket."

06:11.108 --> 06:13.074
What does a fart
bucket even look like?

06:13.076 --> 06:14.776
You!

06:16.679 --> 06:19.280
All right, I walked
right into that one.

06:19.282 --> 06:21.983
Okay, let's work on our
dance to the video.

06:21.985 --> 06:24.119
Would anyone like to
demonstrate a step-kick?

06:24.121 --> 06:26.788
Me, me, me! I'm great
at step-kicking!

06:32.128 --> 06:34.629
Boom.

06:34.631 --> 06:36.898
Nice job, Herman.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.266
You get a lollipop.

06:38.268 --> 06:39.701
Whoo-hoo!

06:41.270 --> 06:45.140
I always give out lollipops
when people follow directions.

06:45.142 --> 06:47.709
Mikey, would you like
to try the step-kick?

06:47.711 --> 06:49.277
Okay.

06:50.746 --> 06:51.579
- Step.
- Ow.

06:51.581 --> 06:53.581
Kick.

06:54.850 --> 06:56.785
Thank you!

06:56.787 --> 06:59.654
Technically, he did
follow directions.

06:59.656 --> 07:03.691
Blech! I hate lollipops!

07:05.161 --> 07:05.960
I don't get it.

07:05.991 --> 07:08.730
Positive reinforcement
usually works.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.633
Well, I tried to be nurturing
with Mikey, but it was no use.

07:11.635 --> 07:14.202
How do you nurture
a human nightmare?

07:14.204 --> 07:17.038
You two know nothing
about children.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.273
Where is the little brat?

07:18.275 --> 07:19.841
He's up in the practice room,

07:19.843 --> 07:21.609
most likely breaking
something...

07:21.611 --> 07:23.244
Or someone.

07:23.246 --> 07:26.714
When it comes to bad behavior, you
just have to lay down the law.

07:26.716 --> 07:29.651
I'm going to go and let
Mikey know who's boss.

07:36.892 --> 07:38.860
Yeah, he's a monster.

07:38.862 --> 07:41.296
You guys are amateurs.

07:41.298 --> 07:42.864
I'll take over the music video.

07:42.866 --> 07:44.232
I'm great with kids.

07:44.234 --> 07:47.268
The key is to think
like a 10-year-old.

07:47.270 --> 07:51.706
Wow. It looks like Mikey's
actually listening to Dez.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.942
Dez, how did you
get him to behave?

07:53.944 --> 07:55.710
It's simple.

07:55.712 --> 07:57.912
You just got to find out
what a kid's passion is.

07:57.914 --> 08:00.949
Mikey likes to edit, Herman likes
to say he's great at stuff,

08:00.951 --> 08:03.785
and Stewie just likes
to lick things.

08:04.987 --> 08:07.822
Anyway, it turns out Mikey's
a natural at editing.

08:07.824 --> 08:09.224
He's doing the final cut
of the music video.

08:09.226 --> 08:11.759
Okay, Dez, I'm finished.

08:11.761 --> 08:13.695
Great!

08:13.697 --> 08:15.363
This is gotta see.

08:20.704 --> 08:22.670
Wow. This looks amazing.

08:38.721 --> 08:42.690
What a bunch of fart buckets!

08:42.692 --> 08:48.162
I'm usually great at not getting upset,
but now I'm having a really hard time!

08:49.766 --> 08:52.133
Okay, okay, let's take a break.

08:52.135 --> 08:54.269
Let's take a break.

08:55.305 --> 08:56.704
This is terrible.

08:56.706 --> 08:57.939
We've got to kick Mikey out.

09:05.848 --> 09:07.882
Sorry. It's not funny at all.

09:07.884 --> 09:10.218
We've got to kick Mikey out.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.726
Mikey's mom is on her
way to pick him up.

09:18.728 --> 09:21.896
As soon as she gets here, you tell
her that we're kicking Mikey out.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.898
Why do I have to tell her?

09:23.900 --> 09:26.501
Because everyone knows
you're the mean one.

09:26.503 --> 09:28.102
What?

09:28.104 --> 09:31.839
See? Now you're yelling
for no reason.

09:32.975 --> 09:35.376
Hey, honey, can I talk
to you for a sec?

09:35.378 --> 09:38.146
I'll be downstairs.

09:38.148 --> 09:39.447
Got to warn you, Mr. Dawson.

09:39.449 --> 09:41.249
She's in one of her moods.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.854
Ally, um...

09:46.856 --> 09:49.791
This is hard for me to tell you.

09:49.793 --> 09:52.327
Dad, I know you're
dating someone.

09:52.329 --> 09:55.263
That wasn't hard at all.

09:55.265 --> 09:56.497
How did you know?

09:56.499 --> 09:59.033
Your last batch of
giraffe paintings.

09:59.035 --> 10:00.535
They're all so romantic.

10:00.537 --> 10:03.938
What can I say? I'm
a romantic guy.

10:03.940 --> 10:08.876
Anyway, I know it must be weird for
you to think of me dating someone.

10:08.878 --> 10:13.915
Yeah, it... it was, at first, but
I really want you to be happy.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.417
I really am, I mean,
Joanna's an amazing person,

10:16.419 --> 10:18.820
and I promise I'll introduce
her to you really soon.

10:18.822 --> 10:21.856
Okay. Just promise you won't
keep any more secrets from me.

10:21.858 --> 10:23.358
I don't want to
suddenly discover

10:23.360 --> 10:25.994
a painting of two giraffes
in a tuxedo and veil.

10:30.399 --> 10:31.499
- Boom.
- Boom.

10:32.868 --> 10:34.402
Ally, his mom is here.

10:34.404 --> 10:35.503
Okay.

10:35.505 --> 10:37.338
I guess we have to do this.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.008
Great. Use that anger.

10:45.481 --> 10:46.948
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.984
Ally has something she
wants to tell you.

10:49.986 --> 10:54.255
I just want to let you know, Mikey
is having a great time here.

10:54.257 --> 10:57.959
He says you guys
really inspire him.

10:57.961 --> 10:58.960
Aw.

10:58.962 --> 10:59.994
Well, thanks.

10:59.996 --> 11:03.431
But I actually, um...

11:03.433 --> 11:06.067
Wanted to let you know that...

11:06.069 --> 11:07.969
Mikey is...

11:07.971 --> 11:08.903
Honey?

11:08.905 --> 11:10.505
Yes?

11:10.507 --> 11:12.140
Huh?

11:12.142 --> 11:14.976
I... I guess we're
doing this now.

11:14.978 --> 11:18.046
Uh, Ally, this is joanna.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.481
Ally is your daughter?

11:20.483 --> 11:21.883
This is joanna?

11:21.885 --> 11:22.917
Yeah.

11:22.919 --> 11:24.352
What a coincidence!

11:24.354 --> 11:27.255
My little Mikey is
taking classes here.

11:27.257 --> 11:32.126
I can't believe I didn't put together
that this Ally was your Ally.

11:32.128 --> 11:34.095
So, what was it you
wanted to tell me?

11:35.497 --> 11:37.865
Uh, I was...

11:37.867 --> 11:39.333
Just gonna say that

11:39.335 --> 11:42.570
Mikey is...

11:42.572 --> 11:48.443
Really talented, and we are thrilled
to have him here at the music factory.

11:48.445 --> 11:51.245
Yeah. It's not like
he's obnoxious

11:51.247 --> 11:54.649
or has any sort of behavioral
problems whatsoever.

12:05.194 --> 12:07.995
So your dad is
dating Mikey's mom?

12:07.997 --> 12:09.630
Wow.

12:09.632 --> 12:13.000
That must have made it super
awkward when you kicked him out.

12:13.002 --> 12:15.603
I didn't kick him out.

12:15.605 --> 12:18.272
I can't have the first thing I say
to my dad's new girlfriend be

12:18.274 --> 12:20.074
"your kid is a nightmare."

12:20.909 --> 12:23.177
Can it be the second
thing you say to her?

12:24.113 --> 12:26.948
Ally, I know it's weird, but
you have to talk to your dad.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.683
Look what Mikey
did to my guitar.

12:28.685 --> 12:32.253
"Good job being a ding-dong."

12:32.255 --> 12:36.657
Ohh! I was a total ding-dong
yesterday, and I didn't get anything.

12:36.659 --> 12:39.927
Guys, my dad is so happy.

12:39.929 --> 12:41.963
I don't want to do
anything to ruin that.

12:41.965 --> 12:44.932
Okay, Ally, let's say
we don't say anything,

12:44.934 --> 12:47.101
your dad keeps
dating Mikey's mom,

12:47.103 --> 12:50.972
things go really well,
and Lester proposes.

12:50.974 --> 12:54.175
Then she becomes your stepmom,
and then Mikey will become...

12:54.177 --> 12:57.411
The wedding videographer.

12:57.413 --> 13:00.014
No, he'd be my stepbrother.

13:00.016 --> 13:02.049
He could be both.

13:02.051 --> 13:07.088
I can't live with that kid
for the rest of my life.

13:07.090 --> 13:11.259
Dinners, holidays,
family vacations.

13:11.261 --> 13:12.960
Oh, who am I kidding?
My dad would never pay

13:12.962 --> 13:15.563
for a vacation for
a family of four.

13:15.565 --> 13:18.466
What if you guys have
to share a room?

13:18.468 --> 13:23.104
What if you have to share
the family toothbrush?

13:23.106 --> 13:25.373
Your family shares a toothbrush?

13:25.375 --> 13:27.608
Yours doesn't?

13:27.610 --> 13:30.278
This can't happen.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.748
I have to go talk to my dad and
tell him the truth about Mikey.

13:37.052 --> 13:44.025
So, if Mikey's mom and Ally's dad get
married, what does that make me?

13:47.062 --> 13:48.629
Still a ding-dong.

13:49.998 --> 13:52.133
Cool. Just checking.

13:59.775 --> 14:02.043
Hey, honey.

14:02.045 --> 14:05.112
I got us lunch from this new
place, stuff 'n a cone.

14:05.114 --> 14:08.683
Would you like a hot dog in
a cone or pizza in a cone?

14:08.685 --> 14:13.054
So it's just stuff... in a cone?

14:13.056 --> 14:16.224
Yeah. That's why they
call it stuff 'n a cone.

14:16.226 --> 14:18.259
You know, I'm actually
not that hungry.

14:18.261 --> 14:21.195
Listen, dad, uh, I wanted
to talk to you about Mikey.

14:21.197 --> 14:24.165
Oh, I am so relieved you said
he was such a great kid.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.167
Can you imagine how
awkward it would be

14:26.169 --> 14:28.269
for me and joanna if you and
Mikey didn't get along?

14:28.271 --> 14:31.372
Yeah.

14:31.374 --> 14:34.141
That would be really awkward.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.712
Exactly how awkward would it be?

14:37.714 --> 14:39.747
Really awkward.

14:39.749 --> 14:41.249
'Cause I really like her.

14:41.251 --> 14:42.450
Hey, who knows?

14:42.452 --> 14:45.219
One day we could all be
one big happy family.

14:46.822 --> 14:48.055
Ally, you're crying.

14:48.057 --> 14:52.560
Oh, I am just so happy for you!

14:52.562 --> 14:53.728
Thanks, sweetie.

14:53.730 --> 14:56.063
Oh! I told joanna
you'd babysit Mikey

14:56.065 --> 14:58.432
while we went out for
her birthday tonight.

15:00.202 --> 15:02.837
I can't take any
more happy news.

15:11.113 --> 15:13.748
Thank you so much for helping
me out with Mikey, guys.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.083
I really want to make
things work with this kid.

15:16.085 --> 15:17.170
- No problem.
- Any time.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.417
You're still paying
us 50 bucks, right?

15:20.789 --> 15:24.091
Hey, Mikey.

15:24.093 --> 15:28.729
Our parents seem to really like each
other, so I think it would be great

15:28.731 --> 15:30.364
if you and I could get along.

15:30.366 --> 15:33.167
Whatever. Now entertain me.

15:34.236 --> 15:35.569
She could sing you a song.

15:35.571 --> 15:37.738
Not a fan.

15:39.174 --> 15:41.876
Why don't we all play a game?

15:41.878 --> 15:46.213
Ooh, let's play cops and robbers, and I
only say that because kids like that game,

15:46.215 --> 15:49.717
not because I already
bought the hats and badges.

15:49.719 --> 15:52.386
Okay. I'll be the sheriff.

15:52.388 --> 15:54.755
Ohh! I wanted to be the sheriff.

15:54.757 --> 15:56.424
Oh! Yay!

15:56.426 --> 16:00.895
We are gonna have so much fun!

16:00.897 --> 16:04.231
Yay! This is so much fun!

16:04.233 --> 16:06.467
You're not gonna
untie me, are you?

16:06.469 --> 16:08.769
Oh, Ally.

16:08.771 --> 16:12.139
I didn't even double-knot those.

16:12.141 --> 16:14.475
You really need to work on
your upper-body strength.

16:14.477 --> 16:16.844
Hey, I can do three push-ups.

16:16.846 --> 16:21.482
I mean, not in a row, but
throughout the course of the day.

16:21.484 --> 16:26.253
Well, while you're tied up, I'm going
to go mess up our parents' date so bad

16:26.255 --> 16:28.589
that my mom breaks
up with your dad.

16:28.591 --> 16:31.192
Look, Mikey, I understand
what you're going through.

16:31.194 --> 16:34.762
Clearly you're just upset that
your mom's dating someone new.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.264
I don't care that
my mom's dating.

16:37.266 --> 16:40.868
I just care that she's
dating a doof like your dad.

16:40.870 --> 16:42.403
See ya!

16:42.405 --> 16:43.871
You won't get far.

16:43.873 --> 16:46.574
My friends are gonna untie
me and we'll stop you.

16:46.576 --> 16:48.809
You mean those friends?

16:48.811 --> 16:51.479
The friends that I just locked
up in the soundproof booth?

16:51.481 --> 16:54.949
Good luck getting out
without a door handle!

16:57.653 --> 17:00.755
We should have let
Dez be the sheriff.

17:06.627 --> 17:08.863
Hey, Ally! Have you
seen my baseball mit?

17:08.865 --> 17:10.798
Herman.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.366
Thank goodness you're here.

17:22.712 --> 17:26.579
Oh! I'm great at letting
people out of sound booths!

17:36.559 --> 17:39.427
No! He just tricked us, so he could
lock us into the sound booth.

17:46.334 --> 17:47.902
I can't believe he tied me up.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.927
But this place is so...

18:16.332 --> 18:18.265
I know, right?

18:22.972 --> 18:27.408
Okay, I see your dad and
joanna, but where's Mikey?

18:29.412 --> 18:34.381
You doofs just got here just in time
to see Ally's dad stink this place up.

18:36.886 --> 18:38.586
What did you do?

18:42.391 --> 18:47.895
And in five seconds, it'll go off,
making your dad a real live fart bucket.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.434
Oh!

19:03.713 --> 19:05.713
Aw.

19:05.715 --> 19:09.016
Well, that's wasn't
all I had planned.

19:15.558 --> 19:18.626
The cake is gonna blow
up and ruin their date.

19:22.498 --> 19:24.331
Ally? What are you doing here?

19:24.333 --> 19:25.866
Saving you.

19:36.345 --> 19:37.778
I lied.

19:44.986 --> 19:47.888
Ally, why did you ruin
my birthday cake?

19:49.859 --> 19:52.660
But Ally was determined
to break you guys up.

19:54.564 --> 19:57.565
Mikey is the one who came down
here to break you guys up.

19:57.567 --> 20:01.035
He tied me to a chair, locked
my friends in the sound booth,

20:04.373 --> 20:07.474
What? Obviously she's
making all that up.

20:07.476 --> 20:09.810
Oh, man, I don't
know who to believe.

20:09.812 --> 20:11.979
Dez, you were there!

20:13.748 --> 20:16.517
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can be in a relationship

20:16.519 --> 20:19.386
with someone who's daughter is
such a bratty troublemaker.

20:19.388 --> 20:21.989
Well, I could never date anyone

20:21.991 --> 20:24.758
who could say those sorts of
things about my daughter.

20:25.694 --> 20:27.995
Come on, Mikey. We're going.

20:30.765 --> 20:34.568
Fyi: Mikey's no longer welcome
at the music factory!

20:34.570 --> 20:37.938
And there are no refunds!
I'm keeping this jacket!

20:40.141 --> 20:42.876
Oh my gosh, dad.
I feel terrible.

20:42.878 --> 20:44.578
You must be heartbroken.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.614
It's not that.

20:46.616 --> 20:51.952
Joanna was gonna pick up the tab for
dinner, but she left without paying.

20:53.455 --> 20:56.824
She was gonna pay for her
own birthday dinner?

20:56.826 --> 20:58.859
That's what made her so special.

21:13.441 --> 21:16.477
Sorry we locked you in
the sound booth, Herman.

21:16.479 --> 21:17.578
Lunch is on us.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.546
Everything looks so good.

21:19.548 --> 21:21.548
I don't know what I'm
gonna eat first.

21:21.550 --> 21:23.584
I'm gonna go with the
burrito in a cone.

21:23.586 --> 21:27.855
I'm gonna go with the
side of ribs in a cone.

21:27.857 --> 21:30.891
Oh! Dibs on the hot dog
on a stick in a cone.

21:30.893 --> 21:33.060
I think I'll try the
meatball sub in a cone...

21:33.062 --> 21:35.596
And the lemonade in a cone.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.465
I still don't get this place.

21:38.467 --> 21:39.833
Oh, it's very simple, Ally.

21:39.835 --> 21:42.536
It's stuff in a cone.

21:42.538 --> 21:45.172
Yeah, I get that.

21:45.174 --> 21:48.642
It's just that the cone
part seems so unnecessary.

21:48.644 --> 21:50.511
Come on, try something.

21:50.513 --> 21:53.647
Fine. I'll have ice
cream in a cone.

21:53.649 --> 21:56.617
Ooh. That only comes in a cup.
