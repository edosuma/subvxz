- Look, everything I'm showing
you has same-day delivery.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.498
I know it's pricy, but spending
money on something extravagant,

09:42.581 --> 09:46.502
but useless, is the best
way to show you care, man.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.547
Now what's your
credit card number?

09:50.756 --> 09:54.343
- Ignore him. Gifts don't
have to be expensive.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.886
For instance,

09:55.970 --> 09:58.014
I would be thrilled
if a guy wrote me a poem.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.308
Or publicly declared
his love for me--

10:00.391 --> 10:02.059
from a mountain top,
by yodeling--

10:02.143 --> 10:04.020
♪ Yodel-ay, Pepper! ♪

10:06.272 --> 10:08.733
- Yeah, that's a bit much.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.360
- Wait a minute, maybe there's
a way to combine

10:11.444 --> 10:14.780
both of our ideas
into one supergift--

10:14.864 --> 10:16.949
something fancy
and romantic.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.369
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, or...
check it.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.288
We could get her
an albino chinchilla.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.333
Cute and expensive.
[laughing]

10:25.416 --> 10:28.919
- Pepper, you were saying?

10:29.003 --> 10:32.214
- [fiddle music]
- SOPHIE: [groaning]

10:35.760 --> 10:39.347
Yeah, husband,
I just lugged this water

10:39.430 --> 10:41.891
all the way from the creek.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.184
Can I get a hand
with some of these chores?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.436
- Sorry. I'm busy.

10:45.519 --> 10:50.399
I just had to paint my missing
tumbleweed from memory.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.734
- That looks like a rock.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.904
- My next painting's
gonna be of my new wife.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.989
- Is she gonna be
a rock, too?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.786
- Sophie, I gotta tell
you what just happened.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.747
- Walk with me. I gotta put
Jebediah down for his nap.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.792
[straining, groaning]

11:11.587 --> 11:14.048
- I just saw Zach
and he thinks

11:14.131 --> 11:15.925
Charlie and I
are a perfect couple.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.177
- Whoa. Are you okay
with that?

11:18.260 --> 11:20.596
- Well, yeah.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.431
He just made my decision
a lot easier.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.600
I mean, I like both of them,
but if Zach doesn't like me...

11:24.683 --> 11:27.603
- Then Charlie's the guy.
- Exactly.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.772
I'm gonna be his
girlfriend.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.358
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.
It's worth the five bucks.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.444
But you're still gonna give
me the five bucks, right?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.488
- I'm gonna text him now.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.864
- Cousin Carol!

11:38.948 --> 11:43.661
What did I say about the use
of electronic devices?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.122
- Please, Mr. Savage, I just
need to send one text.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.665
If I don't, Charlie will
think I said no,

11:47.748 --> 11:49.792
and never talk to me again.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.002
- I'm sorry, but it's 1850.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.839
Boy drama hasn't
been invented yet.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.299
- Neither has toilet paper.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.137
I've been usin' leaves.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.847
- [fiddle music]

12:07.184 --> 12:11.313
- You were warned about using
your phone, Miss Dawson.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.150
So, in accordance with
19th century law,

12:14.233 --> 12:15.776
this is your punishment.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.487
- But I didn't even get
to send the text--

12:18.571 --> 12:20.448
possibly the most important
text I will ever send.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.075
If I'm going to be punished,

12:23.159 --> 12:25.995
shouldn't I at least get to
commit the crime, first?

12:26.078 --> 12:27.913
- Actually, back in 1850,

12:27.997 --> 12:31.459
you were pretty much guilty
until proven innocent.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.335
Oh, those were the days.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.796
I will let you out
in a half an hour.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.673
- Sausage and biscuits!
- [gasping]

12:37.756 --> 12:40.468
[quietly]
Sausage and biscuits?

12:40.551 --> 12:41.844
Those are the two dirtiest
words in the 1850s.

12:41.927 --> 12:47.016
Congratulations, you just
earned another hour, hmph!

12:47.099 --> 12:48.976
- Hmph!

12:49.059 --> 12:52.354
- Okay, Asha, stay here.
Oh, but face this way.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.523
That's a better view.
- What's going on?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.150
I have classes.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.402
- [R&amp;B music]

12:58.486 --> 13:01.655
- [deep voice]
Asha baby,

13:01.739 --> 13:04.617
I want everyone
here to know

13:04.700 --> 13:08.120
how very special you are.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.331
"A" is for "Australia,"

13:10.414 --> 13:13.417
because that is
where you're from.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.336
"S" is for how
"Sweet" you are,

13:15.419 --> 13:18.380
my little honeybun.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.383
"H" is for your "Heart,"

13:21.467 --> 13:23.052
which grows bigger
every day,

13:23.135 --> 13:25.387
and "A" is for "Amazing,"

13:25.471 --> 13:29.433
in every single way.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.684
- Newt, what are you doing?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.937
- I'm showing you
how much I care--

13:33.020 --> 13:34.271
which is why I got you
this expensive,

13:34.355 --> 13:38.734
extravagant gift.

13:38.817 --> 13:43.656
Happy Birthday
to my Ozzie dream bae.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.033
- STUDENTS:
[quietly laughing]

13:46.116 --> 13:48.202
- I need to go.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.873
- That was a disaster.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.751
- I don't understand.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.755
If a boy did that for me,
we'd be eloping in Cancun.

13:59.838 --> 14:04.260
- Yeah, I mean, Niecy Johnson
would have been all over that.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.386
As a matter of fact...

14:05.469 --> 14:07.846
Hey, man, you seen Niecy?

14:11.183 --> 14:15.604
- [fiddle music]

14:15.688 --> 14:16.939
- But it's not fair,
Mr. Savage.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.109
He gets to kick back while
I do all the chores.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.403
- I'm sorry, Sophie,
but historically-speaking,

14:22.486 --> 14:25.364
men didn't do much
housework in 1850.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.782
- Well, then, I wanna
be the man.

14:26.865 --> 14:31.161
How about I play Jonas Silverado
and Sawyer can be Abigail?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.997
- Excuse me?

14:33.080 --> 14:33.747
- It would give us
a chance to see history

14:33.831 --> 14:35.124
from a different perspective.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.460
- Okay, Sophie, let's do it.
You and Sawyer, switch roles.

14:38.544 --> 14:43.299
- Yes!
I'm the man now.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.593
- What just happened?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.011
- Get to work, woman.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.681
- Oh, you got
busted, too, huh?

14:50.764 --> 14:54.810
- Hey, Zach.
What are you in for?

14:54.893 --> 14:57.980
- My teacher busted me
for playing a video game.

14:58.063 --> 15:02.026
What'd you do? Rob a train?
Shoot the sheriff?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.652
Ooh, punch a cow?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.946
- I tried using my phone.
- Ooh, serious.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.324
Boy, I thought I was bad.
You're a real outlaw.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.950
- It is serious.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.163
I have a really important
text to send to my--cousin.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.831
- You know, I know how to

15:15.914 --> 15:18.334
get your mind off
that phone problem.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.044
How about we play
some "I spy"?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.254
- Sorry, Zach,
I'm not in the mood.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.715
- Okay, I get that, but you're
gonna like this one.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.717
I spy with my little eye

15:26.800 --> 15:29.470
something that will
haunt my dreams forever.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.598
- Sawyer?!

15:32.681 --> 15:34.808
- Don't...say...a word.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.644
- ZACH &amp; BELLA:
[laughing]

15:36.727 --> 15:38.812
- That's a bummer
about your phone.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.648
If we had it, you could
take a picture of Sawyer

15:40.731 --> 15:42.149
and post it on ClickPic.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.526
- I've actually been trying to
decide on a new profile pic.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.527
Too bad the photos
are on my phone,

15:45.611 --> 15:47.946
otherwise I'd show you.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.281
- Show me anyway.
Just act 'em out.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.866
- Okay.

15:50.949 --> 15:54.286
The first one I call
"Deep In Thought."

15:54.370 --> 15:57.206
Then there's "Flirty Wink."

15:57.289 --> 16:01.543
And, finally, the wild card,
"Cute Startled."

16:01.627 --> 16:03.337
So, which one's
your favorite?

16:03.420 --> 16:04.254
- Well, uh, "Deep In Thought"

16:04.338 --> 16:07.049
kinda looked like
you ate a bad burrito.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.386
Uh, "Flirty Wink" looked like
you had a bug in your eye.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.887
And, uh, "Cute Startled"?

16:11.970 --> 16:14.348
It looked like you were about to
be eaten by a zombie. Ahhh!

16:14.431 --> 16:16.809
- [laughing]

16:16.892 --> 16:18.686
- Bella, you already
have a great smile.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.063
Why don't you just do that?

16:21.146 --> 16:24.149
There you go.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.778
- Uh, maybe we should play
another round of "I spy."

16:27.861 --> 16:31.824
I spy with my little eye...

16:31.907 --> 16:34.410
Sawyer again.
- ZACH &amp; BELLA: [laughing]

16:34.493 --> 16:36.537
- It never gets old.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.081
- Wait, Sawyer,
where's your baby?

16:39.164 --> 16:41.542
- Oh, no, I left
Jebediah in the creek!

16:41.625 --> 16:44.169
I'm a terrible mother! Oh!

16:47.047 --> 16:49.049
- ZACH &amp; BELLA:
[laughing]

16:51.301 --> 16:53.762
- Hey, Newt, we're so sorry
we messed things up with Asha.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.932
But we think
we have a solution.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.100
We've written an apology note
on super fancy stationery.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.311
- I should have trusted
my own instincts.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
I'm gonna do this by myself.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.776
Asha, I'm sorry.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.612
I listened to
some bad advice

17:10.695 --> 17:12.406
and things got
a little out of hand.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.657
- Yeah, a little.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.160
- Anyway, this was
my original gift.

17:16.242 --> 17:19.246
I know it's not much,
and it's not that fancy,

17:19.329 --> 17:21.248
but I thought you--
- I love the Starcade.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.834
It's where we've had all
my favorite moments together--

17:23.916 --> 17:26.086
like the time you stuck fries up
your nose like a walrus.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.588
- I was actually trying
to stop a nose bleed,

17:27.671 --> 17:31.467
but, uh, thank you.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.260
- I'm sorry I ran out earlier.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.970
Grand gestures
make me uncomfortable.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.890
I like the small things
we do together.

17:37.973 --> 17:38.974
- I'll try to remember that.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.810
- But I did kinda
like the deep voice.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.854
- [deep voice]
Oh, did you now?

17:43.937 --> 17:45.814
- BOTH: [laughing]

17:45.898 --> 17:47.483
- So, how did Niecy
like the necklace?

17:47.566 --> 17:50.068
- Oh, she didn't.
- I'm sorry.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.739
- It's okay. Kimberly did.

of painting a tumbleweed.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.467
It looks great,

I love being

gather around.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.159
I have some very sad news.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.497
On August 31st, 1850,
Abigail became ill.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.998
- I did?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.835
- Yes. She came down
with consumption.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.546
Abigail was bedridden.

18:50.629 --> 18:56.176
So, Jonas tended to her and took
on all the household duties.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.720
- Oh, no.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.973
- SAWYER: [sighing]

19:07.980 --> 19:11.191

- Yes!

19:27.332 --> 19:31.086
See? I told you charades
would work in the stocks.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.963
Who knew getting into trouble
could be this much fun?

19:33.046 --> 19:34.548
- Yeah, you know,

19:34.631 --> 19:35.924
I always have a lot of
fun hanging out with you.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.427
- You know what?
I do, too.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.429

I helped get your mind off

But if she sees me here,
I'm gonna fail.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.866
- Hey, then why did you put
yourself in the stocks?

20:00.949 --> 20:03.368
- I saw you get locked up

20:03.452 --> 20:05.621
and thought you might need
someone to hang out with.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.955
- Really?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.415
- Also, I hate
the smell of cows.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.629
Bye, Bella.

20:13.712 --> 20:18.050
- All right, Miss Dawson,
time to head back to school.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.301
- Ooh.
- Oh, and here.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.637
I know how much you wanna get
back to your boy drama.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.306
- Yeah, thanks.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.434
- Hey, you, that's not what
those leaves are for, unh-unh.

Hm.

The day's over and I'm no
longer Sawyer's wife/husband.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.115
- Oh, I got my phone back.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.201
- Did you text Charlie that
you wanna be his girlfriend?

20:44.284 --> 20:47.788
- No, I told him he's
a really great guy,

20:47.871 --> 20:49.831
but it's not gonna work out.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.376
- Whoa, what changed
your mind?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.169
- I realized I had a way
better time today with Zach,

20:54.252 --> 20:57.005
than I've ever
had with Charlie.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.049
- Well, it sounds like
you made the right choice--

20:59.132 --> 21:00.259
and not just because it makes
me five dollars richer.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.096
But, seriously, when
are you gonna pay me?

21:04.179 --> 21:06.974
I wanna buy a tumbleweed
from the gift shop.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.184
Oh. Never mind.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.937
- Wait, why do
you need a tumbleweed?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.356
- That is none of
your business.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.529
- I'll have chicken fingers
and a mango smoothie.

- And for you?
- Check it.

sweet potato, not regular,

hot sauce all up in here.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.167

21:34.251 --> 21:36.378
- I just love that
deep voice, Newt.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.090

more where that came from.
