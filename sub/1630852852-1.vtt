WEBVTT

02:25.004 --> 02:26.536
That's the last of it.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.940
Do I get a hello?

02:32.478 --> 02:34.438
Hmm. Oh, wow!

02:34.480 --> 02:35.672
You hung those, huh?

02:35.714 --> 02:37.874
You wouldn't let me hang them.

02:39.718 --> 02:41.979
Kev help you get
all this packed up for me?

02:42.021 --> 02:43.687
No, I'm perfectly capable of...

02:44.823 --> 02:45.716
Never mind.

02:45.758 --> 02:46.917
Uh, hi.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.687
- Hmm, you doing okay?
- Yes.

02:50.729 --> 02:51.695
No.

02:52.531 --> 02:53.697
Maybe. You?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.727
Fine. Yeah.

02:56.769 --> 03:01.932
Well, I certainly didn't expect
a pandemic and then a divorce,

03:01.974 --> 03:03.874
and the timing
sure isn't good for me.

03:04.910 --> 03:05.876
For you?

03:06.945 --> 03:08.505
Really, Bill?

03:08.547 --> 03:10.474
This can't come
as a big surprise.

03:10.516 --> 03:12.816
You haven't been in this
marriage for a very long time.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.846
Yeah, no. No, it hasn't.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.824
It took both of us to get here,
but you know what?

03:22.094 --> 03:23.660
I'm going to start over.

03:25.931 --> 03:26.897
Okay.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.326
Okay.

03:29.368 --> 03:30.334
I get it.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.897
Look, uh, where's Kev?

03:33.939 --> 03:35.832
Grocery store.

03:35.874 --> 03:38.035
Well, like it or not,
we have a child together.

03:38.077 --> 03:39.703
I'm going to see him.

03:39.745 --> 03:42.773
Of course.
This is between you and me.

03:42.815 --> 03:46.043
You can see Kev whenever you
want, whenever he wants.

03:46.085 --> 03:47.911
He's almost 17,
he'll come to you.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.513
Hmm.

03:49.555 --> 03:52.622
Listen, my friend Wanda
is on her way over.

03:55.894 --> 03:58.061
Okay. Well, you know, I just wanted
this to end on an okay note, but, uh...

03:59.098 --> 04:00.824
You take care.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.559
I just need
you to be here for Kev.

04:02.601 --> 04:03.967
This isn't easy for him.

04:04.837 --> 04:05.836
Yeah, I know.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.098
I know.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.608
Look, you know, in spite of
what's happened...

04:12.511 --> 04:15.145
I'm here for you and Kev,
always.

04:16.115 --> 04:17.880
Can't pretend
20 years was nothing.

04:25.023 --> 04:26.350
All right.

04:29.762 --> 04:31.094
Close this.

04:47.045 --> 04:48.372
Hi.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.940
Hey.

04:49.982 --> 04:51.675
Hubby?

04:51.717 --> 04:53.116
Soon to be ex-hubby.

04:57.156 --> 04:58.849
For you.

04:58.891 --> 05:01.385
I'm really not in a very
good place right now, Wanda.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.660
I know my friend.
Just open it.

05:15.174 --> 05:16.640
I love it. I do.

05:18.577 --> 05:20.844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.408
Well, sit.
Come and sit for a minute.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.742
You got somewhere to be?

05:25.784 --> 05:27.878
A hot date or something?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.119
You know that's not true.

05:33.459 --> 05:36.226
Okay, you know, the timing
might be really off...

05:37.629 --> 05:38.929
or maybe it's perfect. I...

05:40.199 --> 05:42.626
I've been planning
a road trip up north.

05:42.668 --> 05:43.667
Why don't you come with me?

05:44.736 --> 05:46.463
Oh, my goodness!

05:46.505 --> 05:48.031
I'm not up for a vacation.

05:48.073 --> 05:50.467
I've got Kevin to think about
and it's a pandemic.

05:50.509 --> 05:52.936
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not thinking vacation.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.771
I'm thinking journey,

05:54.813 --> 05:56.840
in my RV,

05:56.882 --> 06:01.478
sort of a quest, like,
Monty Python in the Holy Grail, kinda.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.979
You're serious.

06:03.021 --> 06:04.981
Yes, absolutely.

06:05.023 --> 06:07.224
And I have all these amazing
places I want to show you.

06:08.093 --> 06:09.920
I bet your mom
would stay with Kevin.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.822
Again, it's a pandemic.

06:11.864 --> 06:14.524
Yeah, but they'd be
totally safe here.

06:14.566 --> 06:17.928
You wouldn't have to worry about
them at all and his dad's close by.

06:17.970 --> 06:21.164
Don't remind me, though my mother
thought he was a great catch.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.974
A great catch?
Like a prize trout?

06:25.711 --> 06:27.577
Oh, sorry, it's...

06:28.814 --> 06:30.247
not a good time for jokes.

06:31.283 --> 06:32.983
It just sounded so archaic.

06:34.152 --> 06:35.585
Not archaic.

06:36.755 --> 06:39.483
I grew up
in a small Midwestern town.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.692
It came with expectations
for your daughter manual.

06:43.729 --> 06:45.896
That included grandchildren
of course.

06:47.099 --> 06:48.999
Best part of all of this
is Kevin.

06:51.136 --> 06:52.496
I envy you.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.064
Me?

06:54.106 --> 06:56.766
I know you, Mary Beth,
but I don't really know you.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.542
I know
what I see on the outside.

06:59.177 --> 07:00.210
You're calm...

07:01.246 --> 07:02.212
poised...

07:03.282 --> 07:04.875
supermom.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.550
I envy you.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.554
You're so self-assured
and gutsy.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.056
I've forgotten how to be a...

07:14.693 --> 07:16.753
badass woman.

07:16.795 --> 07:18.188
Come on, I am.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.123
I bet there's still
a badass inside there.

07:20.165 --> 07:22.192
I know there is and she's
just itching to get out

07:22.234 --> 07:23.894
and go on a road trip.

07:23.936 --> 07:26.196
Oh, hey,

07:26.238 --> 07:29.239
you told me that you used to be a
professional fashion photographer, right?

07:30.175 --> 07:33.243
Well, I pulled this off the wall
from the Laundromat and I think...

07:34.713 --> 07:36.006
you ought to do it.

07:36.048 --> 07:38.148
A photography contest?

07:40.686 --> 07:42.546
Me, taking professional
photos again?

07:42.588 --> 07:44.881
You are out of your mind.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.784
Oh, come on. Don't give me
that I can't do it stuff.

07:47.826 --> 07:51.054
Of course you can and you
should on our journey.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.823
What, are we we're heading to
the set of a Vogue shoot?

07:53.865 --> 07:56.066
Oh, be open, Mary Beth.

07:58.804 --> 07:59.979
Have I ever stood you wrong?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.237
Okay, the 5k was something
I thought you could handle.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.134
You did come in 25th.

08:04.176 --> 08:06.636
There were 26 runners.

08:06.678 --> 08:09.739
To be fair,
I really don't like to run.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.641
It is all in the journey,
Mary Beth.

08:11.683 --> 08:12.676
You got to trust me.

08:12.718 --> 08:15.612
You know, we may not find
the Holy Grail, baby,

08:15.654 --> 08:18.248
but we'll have a hell of a
good time looking for it.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.951
Come on,
go pack a bag and call your mom.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.965
Okay.

08:30.702 --> 08:31.835
Uh, I'll do it!

08:33.270 --> 08:34.236
Yes!

08:35.173 --> 08:37.000
I'll... I'll do it!

08:37.042 --> 08:38.969
Yes!

08:39.010 --> 08:43.306
I'll pack my camera
and see what happens.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.108
How did I let you into my life?

08:46.785 --> 08:48.845
Well, as your loyal and trusty
delivery person,

08:48.887 --> 08:53.617
I did deliver about a package a
day to you for over two months.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.685
Did you ever use all that
toilet paper by the way?

08:55.727 --> 08:59.022
You said RV,
I'll supply the toilet paper.

08:59.064 --> 09:01.124
It's the least I can do.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.160
I'm going to go get the RV ready.
This is going to be so much fun.

09:04.202 --> 09:05.729
Wanda.

09:05.771 --> 09:07.864
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

09:07.906 --> 09:09.866
For what?

09:09.908 --> 09:10.874
Just...

09:11.777 --> 09:12.909
thanks.

09:39.471 --> 09:41.798
I'll put this in your room
for you.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.834
I still have no idea
why you want to do this.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.903
Thanks, Kev.

09:46.945 --> 09:50.880
I'm thinking of this as me being
brave, new beginning and all.

10:00.125 --> 10:04.994
Before Wanda burst into my life,
it was like, I was swimming in mud,

10:05.864 --> 10:09.826
slowly, backwards,
actually with very little oxygen,

10:11.069 --> 10:13.063
But then,

10:13.105 --> 10:17.100
she delivered this teapot from
a long ago lover named Barbara

10:17.142 --> 10:19.876
and it was like I woke up.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.205
I felt alive again...

10:22.247 --> 10:28.778
and it made me realize that
I had to get out of the mud.

10:33.158 --> 10:34.157
Wanda.

10:35.026 --> 10:37.287
<i>You ready to rock 'n' roll?</i>

10:37.329 --> 10:39.923
<i>Hey, don't back out on me now.
You know, I need this as much as you do.</i>

10:39.965 --> 10:41.458
I'm getting there.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.227
I'm not really sure
if I'm packing the right stuff.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.197
You know, you do realize we met
because of all the various things

10:47.239 --> 10:50.834
that you purchased online when this pandemic
started and that I delivered to you.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.843
<i>I know. I did kind of get crazy.</i>

10:54.813 --> 10:57.373
- <i>I'll finish packing. You ready?</i>
- I'm always ready.

10:57.415 --> 10:58.842
I'll see you soon.

10:58.884 --> 11:00.877
- <i>Wanda.</i>
- Yeah.

11:00.919 --> 11:03.780
<i>I'm glad you were literally
delivered into my life.</i>

11:03.822 --> 11:05.148
Funny.

11:05.190 --> 11:08.084
At your service, ma'am,
and right back at you.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.092
I'll see you soon.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.834
This is going to be so much fun.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.371
This could be
a terrible mistake.

11:24.009 --> 11:25.275
Yee-haw!

11:46.598 --> 11:48.391
<i>Barbara,</i>

11:48.433 --> 11:51.100
<i>look at where you started
all those years ago.</i>

11:51.937 --> 11:57.333
<i>When you sent that teapot a few months
ago, every memory came flooding back.</i>

11:57.375 --> 12:00.944
<i>London and then those weeks
at Big Sur.</i>

12:02.480 --> 12:03.613
<i>What could have been?</i>

12:05.183 --> 12:06.249
<i>You and me.</i>

12:20.031 --> 12:21.391
Hi, mom.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.359
<i>Have you completely
lost your mind?</i>

12:23.401 --> 12:25.962
Oh, good morning to you too.

12:26.004 --> 12:30.533
<i>Ugh, you do realize
that this pandemic isn't over.</i>

12:30.575 --> 12:33.069
Yes, of course I do.
Why do you have a mask on?

12:33.111 --> 12:35.972
Because they say,
a mask protects you.

12:36.014 --> 12:38.408
You're sitting outside
on your patio, it's...

12:38.450 --> 12:41.885
it's going out among other
humans that you put a mask on.

12:42.654 --> 12:44.480
<i>I'm making a point.</i>

12:46.191 --> 12:48.151
<i>So why the hell
would you go on a...</i>

12:48.193 --> 12:49.853
<i>Well, a vacation?</i>

12:49.895 --> 12:51.554
It's not a vacation.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.890
Thanks for coming
to stay with Kevin.

12:53.932 --> 12:57.527
Bill's going to be around,
but says he'll be doing his own traveling.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.563
<i>Oh, what does he think about
your little adventure?</i>

13:00.605 --> 13:03.933
I haven't told him, yet.
I'm going to tell him tonight.

13:05.543 --> 13:08.071
<i>Well, if he says okay
then I'll come.</i>

13:08.113 --> 13:10.340
Ma, you do know,
I don't need his permission.

13:10.382 --> 13:12.642
I'm... Our divorce is final
in a few weeks.

13:12.684 --> 13:14.984
I'm... I'm telling him.
I'm not asking him.

13:16.621 --> 13:21.150
My mother is a combination
of unbridled adoration of me.

13:21.192 --> 13:26.656
Her only child and undisguised
judgment of me, her only child,

13:26.698 --> 13:30.967
but if you asked her, she doesn't
have a judgmental bone in her body.

13:31.636 --> 13:35.431
<i>I just have to say,
I think this is a terrible idea.</i>

13:35.473 --> 13:38.508
Mom, I would expect you
to say nothing less.

13:39.344 --> 13:42.305
Well, I've got to get going.
Lots to do.

13:42.347 --> 13:43.907
- See you tomorrow.
- <i>But...</i>

13:49.087 --> 13:50.613
Bill,
I'm just letting you know,

13:50.655 --> 13:53.256
so that you can check in
on Kevin once in a while.

13:54.192 --> 13:56.019
Mom will be here.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.293
Kevin will be fine.

13:59.597 --> 14:00.563
Uh...

14:01.666 --> 14:02.999
A couple weeks.

14:04.235 --> 14:05.201
No plan.

14:08.707 --> 14:10.606
They'll survive.

14:13.611 --> 14:14.744
I know.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.981
This is so not me.

14:23.588 --> 14:24.754
Thank goodness.

14:34.566 --> 14:36.259
Mom!

14:36.301 --> 14:38.594
I left early.

14:38.636 --> 14:41.397
Thought I had better see you one last
time in case you end up in the hospital

14:41.439 --> 14:45.735
or have some enlightening
epiphany that changes you forever.

14:45.777 --> 14:49.072
Leave it to you to leap
to the worst possible scenario.

14:49.114 --> 14:50.680
I'll be back.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.784
I... I just hope you find
what you're looking for.

14:57.055 --> 14:59.248
You know, it's...

14:59.290 --> 15:03.453
it's not really a good idea to
travel alone, especially for a woman.

15:03.495 --> 15:07.463
I'll do both
and I'm not traveling alone.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.027
Oh, with who?

15:11.069 --> 15:13.129
Oh, it's a long story,

15:13.171 --> 15:18.267
but with Wanda, that delivery
person that convinced me to do this.

15:18.309 --> 15:22.672
Oh, so you are traveling
with a virtual stranger.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.073
Oh, my God, Mary Beth!

15:24.115 --> 15:25.641
What do you even know about her?

15:25.683 --> 15:28.184
Everything that I need to know.

15:29.521 --> 15:32.482
I am completely baffled
by all of this.

15:32.524 --> 15:34.784
People get divorced
all the time,

15:34.826 --> 15:38.721
but it doesn't mean that you should put your
health at risk or start acting foolish.

15:38.763 --> 15:42.358
Foolish was putting my life
on hold for 20 years.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.559
That was foolish.

15:43.601 --> 15:47.130
You know what? I'm not even
going to talk to you about this.

15:47.172 --> 15:49.432
Have you been tested?
Has this Wanda?

15:49.474 --> 15:52.642
Yes, and we're both negative,
so stop worrying.

15:53.845 --> 15:56.412
I'm going to worry, it's my job.

15:59.217 --> 16:01.384
Speaking of jobs, Kevin...

16:12.764 --> 16:15.124
A food truck!

16:15.166 --> 16:17.266
- RV.
- Uh-huh.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.131
Surprise!

16:22.173 --> 16:25.468
Hey, I'm Wanda,
former delivery person,

16:25.510 --> 16:28.211
but you can call me,
the navigator...

16:30.515 --> 16:33.409
or Wanda.
Wanda... Wanda works.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.318
So, you must be her mother.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.249
Good job, mom!

16:40.291 --> 16:41.184
Uh!

16:42.861 --> 16:45.188
So what do you think?

16:45.230 --> 16:47.323
I love to take off on the weekend,
so I just turned this into a food truck.

16:47.365 --> 16:50.259
Actually a soup truck
and it pays the expenses.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.595
You know, I washed the whole
thing before I came over here

16:52.637 --> 16:55.138
and then bugs on the freeway
decided to die on my windshield.

16:55.773 --> 16:59.702
This Wanda,
not exactly as I pictured her.

16:59.744 --> 17:01.644
Not like your usual friends.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.272
I know.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.615
Maybe that's why I like her.

17:08.286 --> 17:09.652
Kev,

17:10.922 --> 17:14.150
You and I, there?

17:14.192 --> 17:15.785
Yeah.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.627
Oh, I've slept here so many
times. It's really comfy.

17:23.701 --> 17:25.143
I don't snore.

17:25.185 --> 17:26.628
Oh, and I, you know,
I can sleep on the edge.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.132
I usually sleep like
just on the edge.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.867
Actually here,

17:30.909 --> 17:33.870
sometimes, on his edge,
I just sleep like this.

17:33.912 --> 17:35.238
You can have...

17:35.280 --> 17:37.473
Or you know what?

17:37.515 --> 17:41.177
Sometimes I can sleep in the driver's
seat too because I'm really flexible.

17:41.219 --> 17:42.411
Just...

17:42.453 --> 17:44.447
I just do that like...

17:44.489 --> 17:48.384
You know, like this and just
get into a really small ball,

17:48.426 --> 17:50.253
and then just like, you know...

17:50.295 --> 17:51.821
Right.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.525
Mom, take care
and I'll call you soon.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.593
Don't let Kevin get away
with anything.

17:57.635 --> 18:00.603
Oh, you... He would be hard-pressed
to try to pull one over on me.

18:02.740 --> 18:03.706
Okay.

18:06.244 --> 18:07.543
Time to roll.

18:10.615 --> 18:12.642
I didn't think
a lot of this through.

18:12.684 --> 18:17.713
Chalk it up to expect the
unexpected and go with it.

18:17.755 --> 18:19.515
- So not me.
- Hmm.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.318
Okay, isn't that the point,
to try out a new you?

18:22.360 --> 18:23.719
Wear this.

18:23.761 --> 18:25.354
- Good vibes.
- Yep.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.590
I don't know.

18:27.632 --> 18:30.233
I don't know Wanda. Is it supposed to
sink through the cotton or something?

18:31.469 --> 18:32.395
Just put it on.

18:41.512 --> 18:42.545
Holiday Inn.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.821
How long do you think
it'll take before she calls?

18:52.657 --> 18:53.689
About an hour.

18:54.525 --> 18:56.259
That's what I'm thinking.

19:21.519 --> 19:22.485
There you go!

19:23.521 --> 19:25.381
Ever pee in the forest?

19:25.423 --> 19:26.789
First time for everything.

19:28.826 --> 19:29.952
You know, when I was a kid...

19:29.994 --> 19:33.489
my mom used to put this pot
in the back of the car

19:33.531 --> 19:36.492
for us kids to pee in
when we were traveling.

19:36.534 --> 19:37.800
I prefer the woods.

19:39.070 --> 19:41.397
Did you know
that boys still miss

19:41.439 --> 19:44.473
even when the hole is
a foot wide and 12 inches away.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.477
I have a boy, remember?

19:49.747 --> 19:50.973
That's right.

19:52.784 --> 19:54.477
What?

19:54.519 --> 19:55.511
What's so funny?

19:55.553 --> 19:58.748
I love the added flair
to your wardrobe.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.683
Oh jeez!

20:00.725 --> 20:02.525
It's part of my comedy routine.

20:09.434 --> 20:10.926
Beautiful, isn't it?

20:13.037 --> 20:15.598
Just freaking beautiful.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.605
Sure is.

20:18.943 --> 20:20.503
So tell me about this garden.

20:20.545 --> 20:25.841
You know, I sort of happened upon
it one weekend a long time ago.

20:25.883 --> 20:29.785
I was traveling and got lost,
pulled over at this cabin.

20:31.456 --> 20:34.056
Person who lived on the property took
me for a walk through the garden.

20:35.093 --> 20:37.793
And it was this beautiful...

20:38.996 --> 20:42.064
peaceful, calming place.

20:43.868 --> 20:47.730
I thought it would be a great,
new beginning for our journey.

20:47.772 --> 20:50.473
You know, something to get our
heads in a different place.

20:52.143 --> 20:55.805
I've never asked you, but have
you ever been married?

20:55.847 --> 20:57.873
Oh, no, no.

20:57.915 --> 21:01.577
I've had a few relationships with
women, nothing super long term.

21:01.619 --> 21:03.452
Nobody broke my heart
or anything...

21:04.589 --> 21:06.122
although, one or two came close.

21:07.925 --> 21:08.818
Women?

21:08.860 --> 21:09.859
Hmm.

21:11.929 --> 21:14.530
Come on, Mary Beth,
you haven't figured that out by now?

21:15.767 --> 21:17.566
It didn't cross my mind.

21:19.003 --> 21:20.102
Wow!

21:21.739 --> 21:22.765
Just wow.

21:22.807 --> 21:28.010
Hey, I don't care or anything if
that's what you're thinking...

21:29.781 --> 21:31.907
but you didn't think
maybe I was...

21:31.949 --> 21:33.182
You? No.

21:34.552 --> 21:37.580
We're just two badass women
on a mission,

21:37.622 --> 21:40.383
on an adventure, a journey.

21:41.192 --> 21:42.718
You and me?

21:42.760 --> 21:45.761
No. Well,
that never crossed my mind.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.782
Wanda,
this is absolutely gorgeous.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.118
I wasn't expecting this.

22:10.054 --> 22:13.115
Yeah, so this is the main house

22:13.157 --> 22:18.120
where the spiritual leader and his
students I guess you call them, live.

22:18.162 --> 22:23.492
And then back there through, uh, that
gate back there is, uh, gorgeous gardens

22:23.534 --> 22:25.661
like you have never seen,
an orchard and everything.

22:25.703 --> 22:28.664
Oh, an orchard.
I hope they have an orange tree.

22:28.706 --> 22:30.473
I think they do.

22:31.108 --> 22:33.202
You know what? I'm going to get
us a pot of soup made,

22:33.244 --> 22:37.072
something, uh,
to awaken our spirits.

22:37.114 --> 22:41.610
Uh, ginger, curry, turmeric,
good for new beginnings.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.746
- Why don't you go take a walk?
- I'd love to.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.554
- Yeah.
- I'm so excited.

22:46.257 --> 22:48.117
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.617
Oh, there's somebody here.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.780
Hello. Hi. How are you?

23:19.223 --> 23:21.083
Hi... Oh, I'm sorry.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.586
Um, habit.

23:23.628 --> 23:27.723
I mean with this thing out there I find
breaking old habits really, really hard.

23:27.765 --> 23:29.558
- You?
- Yes.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.027
Yes, I... I do.
I'm Mary Beth.

23:32.069 --> 23:33.762
Such beautiful gardens
you have here.

23:33.804 --> 23:35.037
Laura, me.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.234
Yes. Well, thank you.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.036
They aren't my gardens actually.

23:41.078 --> 23:43.772
They just they belong
to my teacher, Daiku.

23:43.814 --> 23:45.875
I just have a room
in the big house.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.677
I've been here a few months
so...

23:48.719 --> 23:49.845
You know, I'll introduce you.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.180
- He's right over here.
- Great!

23:51.222 --> 23:53.188
- Yeah, come meet Daiku.
- Thanks.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.086
Daiku,

23:57.128 --> 23:58.687
let me introduce
you to Mary Beth.

23:58.729 --> 23:59.655
Uh, Mary Beth, um...

23:59.697 --> 24:01.557
Higgins.

24:01.599 --> 24:04.126
- Hello.
- Welcome, and no need to bow. I'm not royalty.

24:04.168 --> 24:06.762
What brings you here?
Where did you come from?

24:06.804 --> 24:10.933
Sort of south west of here,
a few hours away.

24:10.975 --> 24:13.769
I'm with my friend Wanda,
she's back at the RV making soup.

24:13.811 --> 24:17.172
It's doubles as a food truck.
Her business.

24:17.214 --> 24:18.841
Weird, huh?

24:18.883 --> 24:20.683
- It's yummy.
- Not weird at all.

24:21.786 --> 24:24.887
Enjoy our gardens,
the beauty and tranquility, the peace.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.584
And please,
have your friend come join us here.

24:28.626 --> 24:29.652
All are welcome.

24:29.694 --> 24:36.191
We don't get many visitors here, so it is a
treat to have new faces and new conversations.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.160
Hey, there you are.

24:38.202 --> 24:40.963
- Hi.
- Oh, it's just as I remember. Isn't it wonderful?

24:41.005 --> 24:42.298
Hi.

24:42.340 --> 24:45.334
Hi, uh, I'm Laura
and this is Daiku.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.236
Oh, hi. Hi, listen,

24:47.278 --> 24:50.839
we had rapid tests today
and we're negative.

24:50.881 --> 24:52.575
How about you guys?

24:52.617 --> 24:54.176
Oh, we, we test every day
at the retreat, so...

24:54.218 --> 24:55.911
Yeah?
Should we take off our masks?

24:55.953 --> 24:58.981
- Shall we?
- Let's keep our distance.

24:59.023 --> 25:01.056
- Welcome.
- Oh! Thanks.

25:01.892 --> 25:03.152
God!

25:03.194 --> 25:05.888
So, you've been here before?

25:05.930 --> 25:08.357
Yeah, yeah,
about five years ago.

25:08.399 --> 25:11.260
I didn't stay on the property,
but I walked through with a friend

25:11.302 --> 25:16.065
and it was so peaceful,
this beautiful, calming, place.

25:16.107 --> 25:18.207
I just knew why my friend
would love it here.

25:19.043 --> 25:24.640
She's finding something that's
missing, you know, or something lost.

25:24.682 --> 25:26.081
I'm looking for,
uh...

25:28.419 --> 25:29.652
Well, uh...

25:32.256 --> 25:33.255
I don't know.

25:34.091 --> 25:35.384
Peace,

25:35.426 --> 25:39.428
calm, direction, purpose.

25:40.698 --> 25:43.932
All can be easily lost,
but they're hard to find again.

25:45.236 --> 25:46.268
You're seeking.

25:47.104 --> 25:48.070
You nailed it.

25:48.906 --> 25:50.305
I am seeking.

25:51.776 --> 25:55.938
It's how to find it, or, gosh,
maybe I never had it.

25:55.980 --> 25:59.375
Wow, I'm talking to
a complete stranger.

25:59.417 --> 26:04.747
Oh, hey, hey, a stranger is just
a friend you haven't met yet.

26:04.789 --> 26:06.281
Oh, hi!

26:06.323 --> 26:07.783
Just the two of you here?

26:07.825 --> 26:10.085
Uh, hey, Kris, join us.

26:10.127 --> 26:12.728
Oh, thank you,
but I need to go back to my cabin.

26:14.465 --> 26:17.159
As you can see,
there are a few others.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.862
There are tent cabins
down that hill.

26:19.904 --> 26:24.933
I prefer a few people who come truly
dedicated to making changes in their lives.

26:24.975 --> 26:28.303
Oh, and please enjoy the
pool, it's spectacular.

26:28.345 --> 26:30.005
Would you guys like
to see the house?

26:30.047 --> 26:32.147
I have a room there
and Daiku lives there too.

26:33.084 --> 26:36.011
Please, go enjoy.
It's getting late.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.253
Nice to meet you, Wanda,
Mary Beth.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.359
Shall we? This way.

26:54.038 --> 26:55.237
This is amazing!

26:56.373 --> 27:00.342
Warm
and cozy with the art.

27:01.312 --> 27:02.878
This is a great house.

27:03.881 --> 27:05.741
I mean, I mean great.

27:05.783 --> 27:07.082
I know, I love it.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.278
How Daiku's decorated it.

27:09.320 --> 27:14.083
You know, most come from his
travels or gifts from his students.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.885
This is beautiful.
Does it have a special meaning?

27:16.927 --> 27:18.253
Ah.

27:18.295 --> 27:19.788
Yeah.

27:19.830 --> 27:22.791
She is the green goddess Tara.

27:22.833 --> 27:25.234
She symbolizes compassion
and liberation.

27:26.237 --> 27:29.238
Revered as a woman
who brings healing and serenity.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.067
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.876
Of course, it's just down there.

27:35.179 --> 27:37.840
Well, hey,
why don't we provide dinner tonight?

27:37.882 --> 27:39.775
I have a big pot of soup
I made out in the van.

27:39.817 --> 27:40.776
Are you a vegetarian?

27:40.818 --> 27:42.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Daiku?

27:42.553 --> 27:47.049
Yes, but he won't be joining us.
He eats alone. His thing.

27:47.091 --> 27:48.817
All right, just checking.

27:48.859 --> 27:51.353
Wanda's famous
butternut squash soup.

27:51.395 --> 27:53.756
A little ginger.
Oh, it's so good.

27:53.798 --> 27:57.059
Caring is sharing as they say
or sharing is caring,

27:57.101 --> 27:59.001
or I don't know,
something like that.

28:01.238 --> 28:02.397
Oh, you know,
I'm going to go change.

28:02.439 --> 28:03.906
Um, have a look around.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.809
And I... I like your friend.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.227
<i>Just be.</i>

28:27.198 --> 28:29.925
Okay, can I get you
something to drink?

28:29.967 --> 28:34.296
You want, um, orange juice,
carrot juice, celery juice?

28:34.338 --> 28:35.531
No thanks.

28:35.573 --> 28:36.532
A glass of wine?

28:38.142 --> 28:39.575
The wine, I'll take.
You get wine here?

28:41.078 --> 28:42.044
Well...

28:46.617 --> 28:48.617
No, we don't get wine here.

28:50.988 --> 28:52.120
Our secret.

28:53.090 --> 28:54.289
Okay, so...

28:55.559 --> 28:58.053
tell me all about
Mary Beth Higgins.

28:58.095 --> 28:59.488
Who are you?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.256
The big question.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.526
Just say the first thing
that comes to mind.

29:04.568 --> 29:08.030
Wash them, squeaky clean.

29:08.072 --> 29:09.231
I'll go get the soup.

29:09.273 --> 29:10.439
Give me a few.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.270
So...

29:15.312 --> 29:19.581
When I left the house
this morning, I was a mom...

29:20.918 --> 29:22.217
a daughter...

29:23.454 --> 29:27.022
a wife,
though soon to be ex-wife.

29:28.025 --> 29:31.126
I meditate too
like you, a meditator.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.556
That's all.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.532
Well, that's actually
just a list of titles.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.002
Jobs.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.337
Seriously, who are you?

29:43.908 --> 29:47.536
Or is it too soon to pry?
I'm sorry. I just...

29:47.578 --> 29:50.512
I'm just always so curious
as to why people are seekers.

29:51.515 --> 29:55.651
Like, what makes them wake up in the
morning and decide to do something, like...

29:57.421 --> 29:59.454
Well, like show up here.

30:00.524 --> 30:02.284
<i>Be open.</i>

30:02.326 --> 30:03.992
<i>Be brave Mary Beth.</i>

30:05.596 --> 30:07.162
In a few weeks...

30:08.532 --> 30:10.399
my divorce will be final.

30:11.535 --> 30:14.670
Twenty years and voila...

30:16.373 --> 30:18.233
a marriage over.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.975
Hmm, it's tough.

30:21.245 --> 30:22.210
Your choice?

30:23.681 --> 30:24.680
My choice.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.444
And did he find someone else
or did you?

30:31.055 --> 30:33.055
You know,
it's nothing like that.

30:34.959 --> 30:38.660
I received a gift from an old
friend, a teapot and...

30:41.999 --> 30:44.075
and a cup.

30:44.117 --> 30:46.234
A memory from a very
close relationship 20 years ago.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.403
It was a wake-up call.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.334
My life has been
very predictable, uh,

30:52.376 --> 30:54.543
rote, not bad...

30:55.646 --> 30:58.146
very lucky in a sense, just...

30:59.550 --> 31:00.615
not...

31:01.485 --> 31:03.412
Fulfilling?

31:03.454 --> 31:05.981
Worth rolling out of bed
in the morning.

31:06.023 --> 31:07.456
A teapot...

31:08.392 --> 31:12.461
and photos of my life before,
it all just became...

31:13.530 --> 31:15.764
decades of going through
the motions.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.533
The memories came flooding back.

31:20.270 --> 31:22.371
I took a very good look
at my marriage.

31:23.374 --> 31:24.406
So did Bill.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.376
It's over.

31:29.546 --> 31:31.079
I'm still processing that.

31:33.117 --> 31:36.445
And this memory, was he a lover?

31:36.487 --> 31:37.619
She.

31:38.489 --> 31:40.182
Yes.

31:40.224 --> 31:44.659
Oh, I'm not gay or anything
just to be very clear.

31:45.496 --> 31:48.423
It was a short thing, a fling.

31:48.465 --> 31:49.691
Hmm.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.533
Not a fling exactly.

31:54.204 --> 31:59.167
I was married very soon after it
and it was the right thing to do.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.243
- For who?
- For me.

32:04.081 --> 32:06.681
My parents, society.

32:09.286 --> 32:12.280
I can't believe,
I'm saying this to a complete stranger,

32:12.322 --> 32:14.282
that I slept with a woman.

32:14.324 --> 32:17.719
And now that she's going
to think that I'm gay or...

32:17.761 --> 32:20.128
or that I'm in a relationship
with Wanda.

32:20.764 --> 32:24.326
Oh, come on, Mary Beth,
not everyone is so judgmental.

32:24.368 --> 32:27.269
You know, in just a few sentences
you told me who you are.

32:29.506 --> 32:30.472
A woman.

32:32.476 --> 32:34.209
A woman
who is changing her life.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.412
Being single
yet bound to a child.

32:38.615 --> 32:40.782
A woman
who questions her desires...

32:42.186 --> 32:43.712
and for whom.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.554
A woman
who makes a decision once...

32:46.490 --> 32:49.151
and decides to never look back.

32:49.193 --> 32:52.320
I'm back. Oh, this pot's hot.
I'm just going to go put it down.

32:52.362 --> 32:55.457
You know, I flushed most of this
down my leg and into my shoe.

32:55.499 --> 32:57.759
I got a lot on the driveway too.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.562
Whoo, I just wanted to
put that down.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.264
There's a hose out there.
I can go wash it off.

33:02.306 --> 33:04.132
Mice or ants or something
will come to eat that.

33:04.174 --> 33:05.600
No, no, no, stop.

33:05.642 --> 33:07.402
Even ants and mice
need a gourmet meal.

33:09.146 --> 33:10.338
- Really?
- Yeah, it smells wonderful.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.140
Oh, thank you.

33:12.182 --> 33:13.775
Mm-hmm.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.444
- You know, my RV doubles as a food truck.
- Hmm?

33:15.486 --> 33:17.779
Yeah, I just pull into a parking
lot somewhere,

33:17.821 --> 33:21.249
slap the sign on the side of
the van and then I sell soup.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.784
One soup, whatever soup
I've made that day.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.853
Pays for the gas,
pays for the food.

33:24.895 --> 33:27.222
A true, genuine, free spirit.

33:28.465 --> 33:31.526
That's me, me and my sidekick.

33:31.568 --> 33:34.863
Oh, well, you certainly don't
like energy, do you?

33:36.173 --> 33:37.339
Is that a gong?

33:38.675 --> 33:40.268
What a great dinner bell.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.736
Go for it. Hit it.

33:48.418 --> 33:50.745
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

33:50.787 --> 33:51.847
Boy, that's addictive.

33:55.559 --> 33:57.452
Did it get cold?

33:57.494 --> 33:59.254
Are you kidding me?

33:59.296 --> 34:01.223
- It's delicious.
- You made this today in the van?

34:01.265 --> 34:02.591
It's so good!

34:05.602 --> 34:07.802
- To girl time.
- To girl time!

34:18.649 --> 34:20.447
Stop it. Stop it.

34:22.786 --> 34:25.714
I'm just going to run this pot
out to the van.

34:25.755 --> 34:27.815
You know what?

34:27.858 --> 34:29.251
I'm actually really tired.
I think I'm just going to go to bed.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.819
You can come out
when you're ready.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.853
- I'm ready.
- Fine.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.157
I'm going to take out the sleeping
bag and sleep on the floor.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.757
You can take the bed.
I just toss and turn when I'm knackered.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.693
You know what? Just stay here.

34:38.735 --> 34:41.295
I mean, Wanda, you get a good
night's sleep in a real bed

34:41.338 --> 34:43.598
and Mary Beth just sleep here.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.639
Both of you
can get a good night's sleep.

34:48.679 --> 34:52.541
Oh, um, okay. Well, if you...
If you're sure about it.

34:52.583 --> 34:54.176
Actually,
I think it's a great idea.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.511
You've done all the driving
and cooking.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.719
Get a good sleep.

34:59.957 --> 35:01.249
Okay, yeah.

35:01.291 --> 35:02.317
You want your bag?

35:02.359 --> 35:04.226
I'll sleep in my T-shirt.

35:04.962 --> 35:05.961
Right.

35:07.764 --> 35:10.899
Okay. Well, I'll see in the
morning, out in the gardens.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.229
- Sleep well.
- I will.

35:14.271 --> 35:15.630
Wanda, love the soup.

35:15.672 --> 35:18.240
Yes, loved it.
Thank you so much.

35:20.010 --> 35:20.918
Good night.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.870
Knackered,
I'm knackered.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.645
Let's get some sleep.

35:31.622 --> 35:32.921
All right.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.384
- Extra pillow?
- Thanks.

35:36.426 --> 35:39.354
And it's pretty comfy
and help yourself to anything.

35:39.396 --> 35:40.589
So...

35:40.631 --> 35:42.891
- Appreciate it.
- Hmm.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.032
You know, it's still early.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.828
You want to get in the hot tub?

35:46.870 --> 35:48.770
I go every night
before I go to sleep.

35:50.574 --> 35:52.234
No swimsuit.

35:52.276 --> 35:55.377
Well, if you're shy
just go in your underwear.

35:56.346 --> 35:58.046
Personally, nude works for me.

35:59.883 --> 36:01.316
Uh...

36:02.586 --> 36:03.785
I don't know.

36:04.688 --> 36:06.755
Come on,
you'll sleep like a baby...

36:07.991 --> 36:10.285
and I can go underwear too,
you know.

36:10.327 --> 36:11.426
Come on.

36:18.502 --> 36:19.901
What did I get myself into?

36:20.737 --> 36:23.004
Ooh, it's nice.

36:31.048 --> 36:32.847
So, I have a question for you.

36:34.718 --> 36:36.017
Why did you come here?

36:38.889 --> 36:40.388
Well, um...

36:42.492 --> 36:44.092
my mom died a couple months ago.

36:45.395 --> 36:47.929
Not COVID-19, but...

36:49.066 --> 36:50.398
died in a hospital.

36:53.804 --> 36:55.804
She went into the hospital
and...

36:57.774 --> 37:01.743
the last time I was near her was as
they lowered her casket into the ground.

37:03.747 --> 37:05.447
No people at her funeral.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.649
No closure.

37:08.618 --> 37:09.718
So...

37:13.023 --> 37:15.056
I'm still working through
my grief and...

37:16.727 --> 37:17.926
being okay with being alone.

37:19.730 --> 37:20.762
I'm getting there.

37:23.467 --> 37:25.667
I'm getting there.
I am and Daiku helps.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.069
He helps me cope.

37:32.008 --> 37:33.408
Thank you for sharing that.

37:35.612 --> 37:36.678
I love the water.

37:37.681 --> 37:38.847
It heals me...

37:40.684 --> 37:42.150
and when I'm in it, I feel...

37:43.820 --> 37:46.788
a peace, cleansing...

37:48.859 --> 37:50.692
my heart slows down and...

37:51.928 --> 37:53.695
my breathing quiets. Here...

37:54.898 --> 37:56.131
give me your hand.

37:58.001 --> 37:59.461
Feel.

38:10.046 --> 38:11.579
Can I photograph you?

38:15.819 --> 38:16.744
Why?

38:16.786 --> 38:17.752
I used to be a photographer
and...

38:18.688 --> 38:20.749
I'd like to enter this contest.

38:20.791 --> 38:24.159
Well, actually Wanda would like
me to enter this contest and...

38:25.695 --> 38:28.496
and I would like for you
to be my first subject.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.167
Well then, sure. Yeah.

38:33.170 --> 38:34.169
Wonderful.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.476
Hmm.
This was a good idea.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.034
Oh, hi ladies.

39:46.076 --> 39:48.036
Good morning.
Did you have a nice evening?

39:48.078 --> 39:49.904
- It was very good.
- Yeah.

39:49.946 --> 39:52.847
Hey, he's a very cool guy.
Just told me to quiet my mind.

39:55.652 --> 39:56.818
Please, sit.

39:58.688 --> 39:59.914
Oh.

39:59.956 --> 40:02.016
Hey, um, you know, I...

40:02.058 --> 40:06.621
I've never meditated before,
do we say the Om thing and, um, and...

40:06.663 --> 40:10.258
And how do we...
How do we sit?

40:10.300 --> 40:12.093
I think... Is it palms down?

40:12.135 --> 40:14.028
No, no, no.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.763
Sorry, I saw a photo with palms
up, right? Palms up?

40:15.805 --> 40:19.000
And...
and how do I sit? Is...

40:19.042 --> 40:20.768
is it the... the legs are...

40:20.810 --> 40:23.638
Is it right over left
or is it the left over the right

40:23.680 --> 40:25.840
because well, you know,
I could do both.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.576
Just relax.
There are no rigid rules here.

40:28.618 --> 40:30.318
In fact, rigid isn't
part of this at all.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.748
Just try to relax your mind.

40:33.790 --> 40:36.024
Relax, okay. Relax my mind.

40:46.303 --> 40:48.770
Om.

40:52.742 --> 40:55.343
Om.

40:57.714 --> 41:00.348
No Om, just quiet.

41:02.018 --> 41:02.984
Quiet.

41:03.887 --> 41:05.246
I'll give it a whirl.

41:06.723 --> 41:07.689
Okay, sorry.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.121
My students come here
with many questions,

41:13.163 --> 41:15.330
but at the core
is one basic question.

41:16.333 --> 41:17.365
Who am I?

41:19.002 --> 41:20.068
Then come the others.

41:21.738 --> 41:23.638
Am I truly living my best life?

41:25.141 --> 41:26.608
Will I find love and peace?

41:28.311 --> 41:30.638
Let go of the phrase I am.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.274
<i>I'd love to photograph
Laura, she's stunning.</i>

41:33.316 --> 41:35.209
<i>My first photo shoot.</i>

41:35.251 --> 41:36.945
- Come to this day...
- <i>A new beginning.</i>

41:36.987 --> 41:38.753
...that you must define
yourselves, but you cannot.

41:39.923 --> 41:41.222
You're ever changing...

41:42.759 --> 41:43.992
ever floating...

41:44.894 --> 41:45.893
ever learning.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.631
Just be.

41:53.403 --> 41:56.170
Just be.

42:06.416 --> 42:08.349
I hope your journey brings you
everything you're looking for.

42:15.258 --> 42:18.086
This is just the beginning
for you, you know.

42:18.128 --> 42:19.988
Be open to

42:20.030 --> 42:21.863
peace, love

42:22.899 --> 42:24.225
now-ness.

42:24.267 --> 42:25.233
Love?

42:26.703 --> 42:27.935
Not right now.

42:29.105 --> 42:30.104
Someday.

42:31.074 --> 42:32.273
Love will come.

42:34.344 --> 42:35.743
I think it'll be with a...

42:36.680 --> 42:39.347
sharing of life kind of person.

42:40.684 --> 42:44.946
Not a certain gender or age
or expectation.

42:44.988 --> 42:46.648
Hmm.

42:46.690 --> 42:47.755
Hey, hey.

42:48.758 --> 42:49.791
I got your camera.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.920
Oh, you got your first
photo shoot today, huh?

42:54.931 --> 42:56.958
You go, girl.
I'll see you guys later.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.827
I'm going to go take a walk
and got to get some soup on.

42:59.869 --> 43:00.928
- Bye.
- See you later.

43:00.970 --> 43:02.730
Have a good time.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.736
Thank you
for letting me do this.

43:08.778 --> 43:11.112
- Of course.
- I'm having a wonderful time.

43:12.015 --> 43:13.975
You're so easy to photograph.

43:14.017 --> 43:15.710
You're a natural.

43:15.752 --> 43:16.918
Gorgeous!

43:19.856 --> 43:23.284
I'm just going to make some few
adjustments here and then eyes to me.

43:23.326 --> 43:27.388
Now I'd love for you to extend your arm,
so I can see the length of your body.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.063
Yeah, beautiful.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.026
Now, if you...

43:32.068 --> 43:34.228
if you don't mind I'd like to go
over here to the stool,

43:34.270 --> 43:36.397
so I can get the sunlight on your
face coming in through the windows.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.032
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:38.074 --> 43:40.742
Great! So, follow me.

43:43.747 --> 43:45.046
Beautiful!

43:46.182 --> 43:47.281
I like that.

43:48.384 --> 43:49.984
I love that expression.

43:53.423 --> 43:54.615
Yes!

43:54.657 --> 43:55.890
That's lovely, Laura.
Really nice.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.223
Beautiful... Oh!

44:02.265 --> 44:04.826
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

44:04.868 --> 44:06.260
I can't find my lucky ladle.

44:06.302 --> 44:08.396
I think I probably left
it in here somewhere.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.865
this drawer.

44:10.907 --> 44:12.900
I'm not interrupting, am I?

44:12.942 --> 44:14.969
We were just finishing.

44:15.011 --> 44:17.071
Oh.

44:17.113 --> 44:19.006
You know, I probably already packed
it up in the RV and just forgot.

44:19.048 --> 44:20.414
You know how that goes.

44:22.986 --> 44:23.951
Nice robe.

44:27.323 --> 44:29.484
The photos will be gorgeous.
I'll send you copies.

44:29.526 --> 44:31.085
I'm sorry.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.894
Thank you for letting
me photograph you.

44:41.838 --> 44:44.999
What was that all about?
You spying on me?

44:45.041 --> 44:46.868
No.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.544
No, of course not.
I was just curious.

44:51.114 --> 44:52.406
I've never seen
a fashion shoot before.

44:52.448 --> 44:54.942
Oh, this isn't Paris.

44:54.984 --> 44:58.913
I was just getting some pics for the
photo contest, you convinced me to enter.

44:58.955 --> 45:00.448
Oh, yeah.

45:00.490 --> 45:02.123
Laura, what a beauty, huh?

45:02.992 --> 45:04.592
I bet those shots are damn good.

45:06.062 --> 45:08.189
Did you get
any of the naked ones?

45:08.231 --> 45:12.093
Are you a 12-year-old boy?
No, I didn't get any naked pics.

45:12.135 --> 45:14.462
Oh, come on, I'm tired.

45:14.504 --> 45:16.470
And I'll bet you do snore.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.873
Why would you say that?

45:25.915 --> 45:27.048
Hi.

45:30.420 --> 45:32.914
I, uh...

45:32.956 --> 45:36.017
I hope your few days with us opened up
your heart and mind to possibilities.

45:36.059 --> 45:38.993
Definitely.
It definitely did.

45:40.196 --> 45:41.589
Yeah.

45:41.631 --> 45:43.364
Come back again
and stay a while.

45:44.934 --> 45:46.360
Oh, hey!

45:46.402 --> 45:48.930
Sorry about that whole
meditation thing.

45:48.972 --> 45:50.164
No Om for me.

45:51.941 --> 45:54.902
I'm not making fun of it.
I, you know, I just...

45:54.944 --> 45:56.537
How do you sit still like that?

45:56.579 --> 45:59.040
I like it. It helps me.

45:59.082 --> 46:01.215
You helped me, Daiku too.

46:02.452 --> 46:03.451
Well...

46:05.555 --> 46:06.914
I couldn't.

46:06.956 --> 46:08.182
- It should be with you.
- Really.

46:08.224 --> 46:09.423
Mm-mm.
No, it should be with you.

46:10.593 --> 46:11.893
Just be.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.122
Remember, just...

46:15.164 --> 46:16.163
just be.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.526
Hey,

46:18.568 --> 46:21.128
while you're just being,
how about a parting gift?

46:21.170 --> 46:23.898
This is Wanda's new famous
Clementine spice soup.

46:23.940 --> 46:26.968
I know it sounds weird
but trust.

46:27.010 --> 46:28.042
Wow!

46:31.080 --> 46:32.006
Bye.

46:47.297 --> 46:48.562
Hey, did you just love it?

46:49.999 --> 46:51.399
How about that Laura, huh?

46:53.236 --> 46:55.236
Yes, and yes.

46:58.007 --> 47:01.242
And how about Daiku?
What a cool guy that is, right?

47:02.078 --> 47:04.478
He's like the Dalai Lama,
but with cooler clothes.

47:05.715 --> 47:07.415
Way cool guy.

47:11.354 --> 47:14.221
You know what? I didn't mean
for any of this to make you sad.

47:16.359 --> 47:17.325
Oh!

47:19.128 --> 47:21.429
I'm not sad at all, Wanda.

47:24.267 --> 47:25.633
For the first time in...

47:27.503 --> 47:29.337
a very long time...

47:30.606 --> 47:31.672
I feel like me.

47:33.543 --> 47:37.712
Not me as someone
living in someone else's life.

47:39.415 --> 47:42.283
Just me.

47:45.421 --> 47:46.554
So sad...

47:49.425 --> 47:50.658
...absolutely not.

47:55.198 --> 47:56.991
How about I fix you
a cup of tea?

47:57.033 --> 47:58.332
I have the water on already.

48:00.269 --> 48:03.304
You know,
I got your little teapot back here.

48:05.608 --> 48:09.704
This is your lucky pot, huh? I mean,
who travels with a teapot. It's hot.

48:09.746 --> 48:13.574
Yeah, it's a long story. It's a long
story but I'll share it with you sometime.

48:13.616 --> 48:17.478
Let's just say that the teapot
is from one journey

48:17.520 --> 48:21.482
and we have started a new one.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.651
- Cheers, my friend!
- Cheers!

48:25.161 --> 48:26.694
To you, to you, Wanda.
Thank you.

48:28.164 --> 48:30.358
I think we need to go camp.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.694
Camp out under the stars,
find the quiet.

48:33.736 --> 48:35.730
Although, the woods are never
really that quiet,

48:35.772 --> 48:38.265
- you know, mountain lions and bears and such.
- Sleep outside?

48:38.307 --> 48:42.169
Yeah, that's the beauty of it.
Surrounded by nature.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.372
We'll head up north for a few
days and sleep in this baby.

48:44.414 --> 48:46.607
I got a great camping
spot up there.

48:46.649 --> 48:49.176
I was thinking maybe we could
rent a cabin in the woods

48:49.218 --> 48:51.345
with running water
and a bathroom,

48:51.387 --> 48:56.450
and then sit on the porch,
and take in all that nature.

48:56.492 --> 48:58.519
Be brave, girl scout.

48:58.561 --> 49:01.522
Wanda will protect you from all
the scary creatures in the forest.

49:01.564 --> 49:04.759
Well, I haven't been camping since
I was a kid and I didn't like it.

49:04.801 --> 49:07.435
Well, you'll like it now.

49:08.271 --> 49:09.797
Okay. Okay. Okay.

49:09.839 --> 49:13.067
Yes, yes, absolutely. Yes, yes!

49:13.109 --> 49:14.368
Whoo. Yes!

49:14.410 --> 49:16.337
Wait,
did you say mountain lions?

49:16.379 --> 49:18.639
I did. I also said bears.

49:18.681 --> 49:20.508
Wanda, Wanda,
what are you getting...

49:20.550 --> 49:23.384
Mountain lions and bears...
Oh, yes, I'm on the journey.

49:58.721 --> 50:00.247
Finally.

50:00.289 --> 50:01.649
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

50:01.691 --> 50:03.851
Yes, yes.
Mom, you and Kevin hanging in?

50:03.893 --> 50:05.319
<i>Where are you?</i>

50:05.361 --> 50:07.721
Wanda and I are camping?

50:07.763 --> 50:12.193
<i>Wanda does know that roughing it for
you is the Holiday Inn, doesn't she?</i>

50:12.235 --> 50:17.131
<i>You couldn't even stand summer camp with
creepy crawlies and owls in the night.</i>

50:17.173 --> 50:19.400
I'm excited about this, mom.

50:19.442 --> 50:24.138
Sleeping under the stars, skinny dipping
in the lake, telling ghost stories.

50:24.180 --> 50:26.307
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- What, what, what's the matter?

50:26.349 --> 50:27.848
<i>You've become 12 again.</i>

50:28.784 --> 50:30.144
Is Kevin around?

50:30.186 --> 50:31.712
<i>He's in his gym.</i>

50:31.754 --> 50:34.148
<i>If you can call tonight
he'll be around.</i>

50:34.190 --> 50:35.716
Any good news about the virus?

50:35.758 --> 50:37.885
<i>It is far from blowing away.</i>

50:37.927 --> 50:40.928
<i>You know, people just don't take
precautions and all of us suffer.</i>

50:41.764 --> 50:46.160
<i>Why on earth you'd want to be out in the
world ripe with disease, I'll never know.</i>

50:46.202 --> 50:49.463
I'm in the middle of the woods.
No one else is around.

50:49.505 --> 50:53.267
I'm probably in one of the
safest places in America.

50:53.309 --> 50:57.438
Hey, mom, I've got to go before Wanda
hurts herself putting this tent up.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.807
<i>Have fun. Stay safe.</i>

50:59.849 --> 51:01.315
Bye.

51:03.886 --> 51:05.513
How can I help?

51:05.555 --> 51:06.680
Oh!

51:06.722 --> 51:08.355
Hey, you can blow this up.

51:09.325 --> 51:10.457
Okay, on it.

51:20.203 --> 51:22.670
By the way, love this place.

51:26.542 --> 51:27.608
I'm okay.

51:33.783 --> 51:35.783
You keep outdoing yourself here.

51:40.923 --> 51:43.584
I don't feel like
I'm making any progress.

51:43.626 --> 51:44.919
Want to use this?

51:44.961 --> 51:46.554
You have a pump?

51:46.596 --> 51:48.495
Yeah, I'm going to die.
I'm so dizzy.

51:49.599 --> 51:51.525
Here, I'll do it.

51:51.567 --> 51:52.726
- Go sit.
- All right.

51:52.768 --> 51:53.928
Go sit down.

52:05.548 --> 52:06.914
I wonder who lives there.

52:08.017 --> 52:10.277
That's another little surprise
I have for you.

52:10.319 --> 52:11.545
Surprise?

52:11.587 --> 52:15.583
I'll introduce you once I
get all this stuff set up.

52:15.625 --> 52:16.517
To whom?

52:16.559 --> 52:17.558
You'll see.

52:31.841 --> 52:33.634
Oh, you're here.

52:33.676 --> 52:35.836
Did you get everything set up?

52:35.878 --> 52:38.739
We did. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

52:38.781 --> 52:42.543
I brought you my newest
creation, Clementine spice soup.

52:42.585 --> 52:44.011
Oh...

52:44.053 --> 52:47.348
Davina, this is my friend
Mary Beth Higgins.

52:47.390 --> 52:50.618
- Mary Beth, this is Davina.
- I know you.

52:50.660 --> 52:53.020
You're Davina Moonbeam.

52:53.062 --> 52:55.996
I was at one of your events
in San Diego a few years back.

52:56.966 --> 52:58.432
Well, I know.

52:59.835 --> 53:01.295
I really don't.

53:02.972 --> 53:06.433
Everyone expects a psychic
to know everything and I don't.

53:06.475 --> 53:10.804
Come on in, make yourself to
home, we hug here.

53:10.846 --> 53:12.673
Oh, so good to meet you.

53:12.715 --> 53:13.607
Oh!

53:13.649 --> 53:15.809
Oh!

53:15.851 --> 53:17.978
- Hi.
- This is Karl.

53:18.020 --> 53:21.348
Ah, he lives mainly in the trailer,
you probably saw when you drove up.

53:21.390 --> 53:23.751
He helps me around the ranch.

53:23.793 --> 53:25.419
I do.

53:25.461 --> 53:27.454
It's a pleasure
to meet you ladies.

53:27.496 --> 53:33.033
Oh, this is my longtime-friend
Wanda and her friend Mary Beth.

53:33.969 --> 53:35.596
You, uh... You camping?

53:35.638 --> 53:37.765
Oh, yeah. We sure are.

53:37.807 --> 53:38.799
Really?

53:41.377 --> 53:43.837
Well, I got to go fix some loose boards
out on the bridge and feed my horse Blaze,

53:43.879 --> 53:47.041
but, uh, if you need anything,
you know where to find me.

53:47.083 --> 53:48.876
You guys have a good day.

53:48.918 --> 53:49.977
Bye, Karl.

53:50.019 --> 53:51.585
- Bye.
- Toodles.

53:52.521 --> 53:53.947
You are something else.

53:56.625 --> 53:59.426
Well, homemade apple cider.

54:00.463 --> 54:02.389
I don't drink,
Alcohol that is.

54:02.431 --> 54:03.564
So...

54:04.633 --> 54:06.026
Fortune cookies.

54:06.068 --> 54:12.573
You will soon be delivered a tall,
dark, handsome, charming someone.

54:13.642 --> 54:15.102
I think
I must have got your cookie.

54:16.812 --> 54:18.505
Ooh, let me help you.

54:18.547 --> 54:19.940
So,

54:19.982 --> 54:23.517
let's use this
to officially welcome you...

54:24.820 --> 54:31.819
and offer a wish for a successful
awakening on this part of your journey.

54:31.861 --> 54:33.427
Wanda filled me in a bit.

54:35.464 --> 54:39.460
I can't believe you already know
who Davina is,

54:39.502 --> 54:41.962
and here I was thinking I had
this great surprise for you.

54:42.004 --> 54:44.598
It's a surprise all right.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.733
Are you retired?

54:45.775 --> 54:47.141
From events, yes.

54:47.977 --> 54:50.838
Well, the mind never sleeps,
but until I die.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.439
- Oh.
- Hmm.

54:52.481 --> 54:53.514
Who knows?

54:54.183 --> 54:55.642
Maybe even beyond.

54:55.684 --> 54:58.652
I'll still see things,
know things.

55:01.190 --> 55:03.384
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

55:05.661 --> 55:08.629
And it's the gift
that I want to give to you.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.526
What?

55:12.568 --> 55:18.399
I came here purposely because I know that Davina
can help you figure out where you're going,

55:18.441 --> 55:20.040
you know, what's next.

55:20.876 --> 55:22.075
Oh, I...

55:23.078 --> 55:24.478
I don't know.

55:25.181 --> 55:27.114
Who really wants
to know the future?

55:28.818 --> 55:30.043
Everyone!

55:31.887 --> 55:34.415
So, come on, Mary Beth.

55:34.457 --> 55:35.789
You've got nothing to lose.

55:36.659 --> 55:38.152
Just be open.

55:38.194 --> 55:39.787
I'm going to wait outside.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.198
Leave you two alone.

55:59.482 --> 56:05.586
You are at the crossroads
in your life, more like a big X.

56:06.856 --> 56:09.223
So many choices. Which...

56:10.493 --> 56:14.127
path to take
is constantly on your mind.

56:15.865 --> 56:21.635
Something happened to awaken your
desire to figure out your life.

56:23.205 --> 56:24.498
<i>No kidding.</i>

56:24.540 --> 56:28.709
<i>Plus, I'm sure Wanda told
you all about our journey.</i>

56:31.580 --> 56:35.716
I was told nothing personal
about you.

56:37.553 --> 56:41.054
Everything I see or hear
is new to me.

56:45.094 --> 56:48.695
Your son... You have a son.

56:49.565 --> 56:51.265
Oh, young, smart...

56:52.668 --> 56:53.834
he will keep well.

56:55.170 --> 56:57.237
You worry about him
now more than ever.

56:58.073 --> 57:01.008
I...
I see him leaving with...

57:02.745 --> 57:07.641
a relative to go stay with them
while you're on your quest.

57:07.683 --> 57:10.217
A quest! Yes.

57:11.820 --> 57:13.153
That's what this is...

57:14.690 --> 57:16.623
but you don't know
what you want yet.

57:19.028 --> 57:20.654
Oh.

57:20.696 --> 57:23.764
I see a... a separation.

57:24.767 --> 57:27.060
Oh, a permanent separation.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.106
It will be...

57:35.878 --> 57:39.106
it will be easier
for both you and your partner...

57:39.148 --> 57:40.180
No...

57:41.216 --> 57:42.282
your husband.

57:43.719 --> 57:45.052
He wants this as well.

57:48.691 --> 57:50.958
I... I see a book.

57:52.995 --> 57:55.055
A book on a table.

57:55.097 --> 58:00.067
Inside are your words and your
photos from this time in your life.

58:01.870 --> 58:04.271
Oh, you have much talent,
creative talent.

58:06.375 --> 58:08.709
Your time to show the world
has arrived.

58:10.346 --> 58:11.345
<i>A book?</i>

58:12.848 --> 58:13.981
<i>My photos?</i>

58:19.121 --> 58:20.621
Oh!

58:23.993 --> 58:25.726
I see a new love in your life.

58:28.230 --> 58:31.164
Someone you know
or have known a long time.

58:34.670 --> 58:36.637
You will know who...

58:37.706 --> 58:40.641
when you are ready
to let this someone...

58:44.046 --> 58:45.012
in.

58:47.883 --> 58:50.083
<i>She does know
I'm still married...</i>

58:51.654 --> 58:53.046
<i>at least another week or two.</i>

58:53.088 --> 58:57.951
<i>I can't imagine having someone
new in my life right now.</i>

58:57.993 --> 58:59.359
I see no.

59:01.296 --> 59:02.262
Time is...

59:03.732 --> 59:05.158
something made up by man.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.893
It's...

59:06.935 --> 59:09.630
My minutes could be your hours,
my days your months.

59:09.672 --> 59:12.906
I am here in the now as you are.

59:16.111 --> 59:17.277
You need to open up.

59:18.881 --> 59:20.013
Take risks.

59:23.852 --> 59:24.878
When you open up...

59:24.920 --> 59:30.691
people, possibilities,
changes, they all come.

59:32.061 --> 59:33.694
Watch for the signs.

59:35.130 --> 59:36.430
They are all around.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.366
Just know this.

59:41.270 --> 59:44.471
What I see in your future
is not easy.

59:46.041 --> 59:51.912
Leaving one life to start another,
but in the end you will find you.

59:53.148 --> 59:56.416
Right now, just be in it.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.098
Present.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.223
<i>Daiku said to just be.</i>

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.059
<i>Laura said I'd find me.</i>

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:09.896
<i>Davina, Wanda...</i>

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.900
Be honest with people.
Don't hold back...

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:18.438
and those that love you
will still be there.

01:00:20.008 --> 01:00:21.508
And those that walk away...

01:00:23.846 --> 01:00:25.278
you don't need.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.061
Hey, I just came
to walk you back to the tent.

01:00:43.065 --> 01:00:45.025
Thank you, Davina.

01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:46.266
You're welcome, honey.

01:00:48.203 --> 01:00:49.202
Good to meet you.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:53.874
I love you.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:09.790
Well?

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.493
I mean, was she amazing or...

01:01:16.165 --> 01:01:17.464
Ever question who you are?

01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:21.201
Yeah, sure, like daily.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:32.439
That's an elusive answer.

01:01:56.305 --> 01:01:58.271
Can I just have a few minutes?

01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:01.875
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course.

01:02:19.261 --> 01:02:21.161
Hey, how about hot dogs
for dinner?

01:02:36.178 --> 01:02:37.244
Wanda?

01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:51.157
Was Davina's reading upsetting?

01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:57.063
I know that things in my life
are coming to an end...

01:02:59.968 --> 01:03:01.167
and...

01:03:02.437 --> 01:03:04.304
she said new things are coming.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:12.639
How she knew about Bill and Kevin,
I have... I can't figure it out.

01:03:12.681 --> 01:03:15.308
- Did you...
- Tell? No.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:17.684
No. Not at all, Zero. I swear.

01:03:18.654 --> 01:03:20.247
What'd she say?

01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:22.883
It wasn't
what Davina said, it's...

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:26.219
She made me realize
that change is coming.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:27.661
It's going to be hard...

01:03:29.698 --> 01:03:34.067
but eventually it'll be good,
in the end.

01:03:35.137 --> 01:03:37.570
Well, that's good, right?
That's the right attitude.

01:03:38.473 --> 01:03:39.673
Just once...

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.142
just once.

01:03:43.412 --> 01:03:46.713
This is all I ask the universe.

01:03:51.219 --> 01:03:53.720
Just once,
I'd like to feel like...

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:58.959
like I'm first or equal.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.458
I want to feel that passion
they talk about.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.501
Passion for career...

01:04:09.504 --> 01:04:11.304
passion for another person.

01:04:12.507 --> 01:04:15.468
You know, I... I don't know
what to say about all that.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.138
I do know that
Davina knows her stuff.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.713
And, you know,
I'm here for you.

01:04:20.615 --> 01:04:24.117
I'm always here for you to...
to talk or whatever.

01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:28.682
Did you want to go home?

01:04:28.724 --> 01:04:30.417
Absolutely not.

01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:32.692
I need this time with you.

01:04:33.762 --> 01:04:35.395
I have a lot to think about.

01:04:38.433 --> 01:04:40.633
Are you hungry? We got to eat.

01:04:44.539 --> 01:04:46.239
Why don't I get you
a glass of wine?

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.308
Wine.

01:04:49.277 --> 01:04:50.477
I'll take the wine.

01:04:51.613 --> 01:04:53.113
I thought you might.

01:05:07.629 --> 01:05:08.595
Shit!

01:05:10.132 --> 01:05:11.731
Ah, fuck!

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.268
Ah! Oh!

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:30.777
Here's some of your favorite.

01:05:30.819 --> 01:05:32.479
Oh! Oh my!

01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:35.015
Oh! Oh, that's cold.

01:05:35.057 --> 01:05:36.549
Okay, let me help you. I got...

01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:38.725
I got it. No, okay.
Now don't look, don't look.

01:05:40.262 --> 01:05:42.655
- Oh...
- Come here. Come here.

01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:45.365
Oh, it's so cold. Thank you.

01:05:46.535 --> 01:05:47.700
I love you.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.338
I know.

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:10.517
Hey, good morning.

01:06:12.227 --> 01:06:13.493
Yes, it is.

01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:15.662
You want some coffee?

01:06:17.132 --> 01:06:18.558
Cream or sugar?

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.567
Oh, relax, black is fine.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:25.205
This looks wonderful.
I'm starving.

01:06:26.374 --> 01:06:28.802
Me too.

01:06:28.844 --> 01:06:33.673
After wrestling with that tent and blowing up
the air mattress, burned a lot of calories.

01:06:36.518 --> 01:06:38.518
I was up really early
this morning...

01:06:39.554 --> 01:06:41.721
and I went, um, scouting
out the place.

01:06:42.757 --> 01:06:45.692
Some really,
really beautiful things to see.

01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:48.795
You want to go exploring today?

01:06:49.698 --> 01:06:52.165
- Do you... do you hike?
- I do.

01:07:04.579 --> 01:07:06.246
You're a really good snuggler.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.919
I was, uh...

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.789
protecting you
from the mountain lions.

01:07:17.759 --> 01:07:18.791
That's all.

01:07:23.365 --> 01:07:24.774
Yeah.

01:07:24.816 --> 01:07:26.226
Well, I can report
that I was not attacked.

01:07:26.268 --> 01:07:27.233
So, good job.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:34.807
So a hike would be great and
a shower afterwards, I guess?

01:07:35.644 --> 01:07:37.871
Is there a shower?

01:07:37.913 --> 01:07:40.273
No.

01:07:40.315 --> 01:07:43.810
I usually just take a couple of buckets
of water and pour it over myself.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:44.918
It works.

01:07:46.488 --> 01:07:47.587
I'll get my shoes...

01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:52.785
and about the shower,
might have to help me with that.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.410
So pretty.

01:08:15.617 --> 01:08:16.582
Okay.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.225
- You draw?
- Yeah.

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.587
I've been sketching a little
bit since I was a teenager.

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:29.929
Like an escape, you know.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:32.258
You're full of surprises.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.661
- Morning.
- Hi.

01:08:34.703 --> 01:08:35.728
He's beautiful.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:39.399
Is he gentle?

01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:40.800
What, Blaze?

01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:42.242
He's an overgrown puppy.

01:08:43.545 --> 01:08:44.844
What, do you want to hop on him?

01:08:46.348 --> 01:08:47.707
I'd love to.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.849
I haven't ridden in years.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:52.852
Get in here.

01:08:56.457 --> 01:08:58.858
- Just bare back, huh?
- Why not?

01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:02.354
Okay.

01:09:02.397 --> 01:09:06.599
- You're going to give me a push?
- Yeah. There you go!

01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:09.796
You're a natural.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:16.809
- Natural.
- Yeah.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:19.511
Oh.

01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:22.908
Hold on.

01:09:35.596 --> 01:09:40.300
If you're going to be around a while,
I could saddle him up, take him for a ride.

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:42.996
I don't know how long
we'll be here.

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:44.504
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:48.033
Thanks, Blaze.

01:09:48.076 --> 01:09:49.769
- Thank you.
- Have a good day!

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:50.810
You too.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.345
- Was that fun or what?
- Oh.

01:09:54.516 --> 01:09:56.816
Oh, I haven't been
on a horse in years.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.919
That makes me feel so alive.

01:10:01.389 --> 01:10:05.491
Just doing these things
that haven't done in so long.

01:10:07.562 --> 01:10:12.432
I'm starting to feel the joy,
I haven't felt in a very long time now.

01:10:13.768 --> 01:10:14.367
Thank you.

01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:29.949
<i>I've been with a woman.</i>

01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:33.686
<i>Just one, long time ago.</i>

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:37.383
<i>I've been with a few women.</i>

01:10:37.425 --> 01:10:40.086
<i>I'm not a womanizing type of
person or anything like that.</i>

01:10:40.128 --> 01:10:41.661
<i>I don't even go to bars.</i>

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.958
<i>I'm not a cheater,
never cheated.</i>

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.500
<i>I'm not either.</i>

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.029
<i>I was</i>

01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:52.672
faithful to Bill
from the day we were married.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:56.509
Now, our only connection
is Kevin, of course.

01:10:57.679 --> 01:11:01.447
Free to choose whatever
and whoever I want...

01:11:03.017 --> 01:11:04.150
and I'm scared of both.

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.619
Make sense?

01:11:08.857 --> 01:11:12.819
So tell me about this one and only
woman experience that you had.

01:11:12.861 --> 01:11:14.921
Was it one of those
college things?

01:11:14.963 --> 01:11:15.928
Right after.

01:11:17.599 --> 01:11:19.392
I was...

01:11:19.434 --> 01:11:22.462
It my first
professional photoshoot.

01:11:23.438 --> 01:11:24.597
What a coup!

01:11:25.707 --> 01:11:27.467
I was all of 20 or so and...

01:11:27.509 --> 01:11:33.406
and I got to go to London,
and shoot this beautiful model in London.

01:11:33.448 --> 01:11:36.476
Had tea on the River Thames,

01:11:36.518 --> 01:11:40.580
very romantic,
hence, the teapot.

01:11:40.622 --> 01:11:43.816
Oh, see, I knew there had to be
some special meaning there.

01:11:43.858 --> 01:11:46.753
I mean who brings
a ceramic teapot on a road trip?

01:11:46.795 --> 01:11:49.929
We met on that photoshoot,
the model.

01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:52.458
The model?

01:11:54.569 --> 01:11:57.597
- I fell in love.
- Hmm.

01:11:57.639 --> 01:12:00.066
That lose your breath
kind of love.

01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:01.140
Oh.

01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:05.211
She was beautiful...

01:12:06.915 --> 01:12:09.649
sexy, funny.

01:12:11.486 --> 01:12:13.786
I was absolutely lost in her...

01:12:14.823 --> 01:12:15.782
for a month.

01:12:15.824 --> 01:12:16.889
Just a month?

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.686
Then?

01:12:20.728 --> 01:12:22.522
Bill...

01:12:22.564 --> 01:12:23.796
my parents...

01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:26.032
my fears.

01:12:29.537 --> 01:12:30.636
I've felt that way...

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.933
in a small way.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.908
But, you know,
like you, I wanted more.

01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:43.783
Having my life be my life
for the first time in forever...

01:12:44.786 --> 01:12:45.818
feels good.

01:12:49.924 --> 01:12:51.918
You okay hanging out with me?

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.053
I love hanging out with you.

01:12:54.095 --> 01:12:55.655
You're...

01:12:55.697 --> 01:12:59.826
You're funny and curious
and a little crazy.

01:13:02.504 --> 01:13:03.669
We're good.

01:13:04.973 --> 01:13:06.032
We're very good.

01:13:20.121 --> 01:13:21.848
You've never had s'mores?

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:22.915
I'm sheltered.

01:13:22.957 --> 01:13:24.817
Okay. So

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.653
- it's time for you to have your first s'more.
- Ooh.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.689
Now, I'll build a fire and we're going
to get everything all hot and gooey,

01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:31.824
but first I want to introduce
you to the ingredients.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.527
You got your trio
of ingredients here.

01:13:34.569 --> 01:13:36.496
You've got your chocolate.

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:38.664
Then you got your graham
crackers and then marshmallows.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.600
I usually have cookies
on a skewer

01:13:40.642 --> 01:13:42.909
and get them really burnt,
and gooey, but the...

01:13:44.812 --> 01:13:46.312
That's my favorite ingredient.

01:14:00.194 --> 01:14:02.187
Whoa!

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.263
- Was that a good sign or what?
- Incredible!

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.094
You know, I ordered that
up just for you.

01:14:08.136 --> 01:14:09.929
Knowing you, I believe it.

01:14:11.706 --> 01:14:13.573
Ah, that was amazing!

01:14:14.342 --> 01:14:16.602
Here, can I have some of that?
I'll trade you...

01:14:16.644 --> 01:14:18.204
- Yeah, give me that.
- ...the chocolate

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:20.039
- for the marshmallow.
- You know what? You know what?

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.908
I don't even need
to melt it anymore.

01:14:39.133 --> 01:14:40.793
You're good.

01:14:40.835 --> 01:14:41.867
Good subject.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:48.868
Shit! I...
I shouldn't have done that.

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:51.637
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I should not have done that.

01:14:54.082 --> 01:14:55.114
What's that?

01:14:57.919 --> 01:14:59.151
My God!

01:15:01.856 --> 01:15:03.049
That sounds really big.

01:15:03.091 --> 01:15:04.650
It sounds like
something's coming.

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:14.226
Oh, my God, Davina!
You're gonna kill me.

01:15:14.268 --> 01:15:18.264
I thought you might like to come up to
the house for some homemade apple pie

01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:22.768
and a cup of cocoa before you...
Oh, were you sleeping?

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.971
Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

01:15:25.013 --> 01:15:26.906
No, no. We're just

01:15:26.948 --> 01:15:30.176
relaxing,
listening to wild animal sounds.

01:15:30.218 --> 01:15:32.612
- What time is it?
- Nine o'clock.

01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:35.681
I would love apple pie
and hot cocoa.

01:15:35.723 --> 01:15:38.824
- We'll be there.
- Let's go.

01:15:51.305 --> 01:15:52.898
Oh, good!
You got here before Gus got you.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.067
- Gus?
- The mountain lion.

01:15:55.109 --> 01:15:56.402
Oh, my God! You named him.

01:15:58.713 --> 01:16:02.008
Cougar, whatever you want to call him.
He's been here for years.

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.143
I don't bother him,
he doesn't bother me.

01:16:05.319 --> 01:16:11.223
Oh, you girls remembered to zip up
your tent and lock up your food, right?

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.854
Thanks for the heads up, Davina.

01:16:14.896 --> 01:16:16.188
Not exactly.

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.057
Oops!

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.433
Sorry, ladies.

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:23.996
It's my mom. I have to take it.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.438
Oh, please.

01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:32.772
Is everything okay?
Did something happen?

01:16:32.814 --> 01:16:34.874
<i>No, no, nothing happened.</i>

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:37.677
<i>I just wanted to let you know
I'm going to head home tomorrow.</i>

01:16:37.719 --> 01:16:40.012
<i>Kevin's going to come with me.</i>

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.049
<i>He can do his remote school stuff
from my house and I get to go home.</i>

01:16:43.091 --> 01:16:45.951
Well, I'll be home in a week.
Are you sure?

01:16:45.993 --> 01:16:47.420
<i>I need my own space.</i>

01:16:47.462 --> 01:16:49.355
<i>I can get my pooch
out of the kennel.</i>

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:51.824
<i>I hope she talks to me again</i>

01:16:51.866 --> 01:16:54.894
<i>and Kevin could use a vacation after
all these months. I have a pool.</i>

01:16:54.936 --> 01:16:57.263
Okay, I understand.

01:16:57.305 --> 01:16:59.865
Just make sure you lock up
the house before you leave.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:03.302
<i>I thought I'd leave the front door wide
open and put up a welcome thief sign.</i>

01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:04.303
Mom.

01:17:04.345 --> 01:17:07.973
Anyway, thanks for taking care
of my boy.

01:17:08.015 --> 01:17:10.309
I'll come pick him up
as soon as I get home.

01:17:10.351 --> 01:17:14.453
<i>I'm actually loving having him to
myself, you know, I get lonely too.</i>

01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:19.285
As a matter of fact,

01:17:19.327 --> 01:17:22.455
one of the things that I'm
learning from all this is that

01:17:22.497 --> 01:17:25.264
we need to be around the people
we love so much more.

01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:29.795
Let's make you and us
a priority from now on.

01:17:29.837 --> 01:17:33.833
<i>Sounds like this trip and your
friend have been good for you.</i>

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:36.108
Yes, both.

01:17:38.246 --> 01:17:42.108
Well, you two have fun
and, uh, I'll call you soon.

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:46.452
And... Hey, ma, if I haven't told
you lately that I love you, uh...

01:17:47.822 --> 01:17:48.788
I do.

01:17:55.396 --> 01:17:57.123
Everything okay?

01:17:57.165 --> 01:17:59.492
Oh, yeah, mom and Kevin are
heading to her house.

01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:02.161
She's anxious to get back
and it's fine.

01:18:02.203 --> 01:18:03.929
Really, it's... it's okay.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.431
Oh, well, how about a warm up,
huh?

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.106
Oh, no. No, thank you.

01:18:10.077 --> 01:18:12.204
Oh, boy!

01:18:12.246 --> 01:18:14.006
This doesn't happen to me
very often.

01:18:14.048 --> 01:18:15.341
What? What is it?

01:18:15.383 --> 01:18:18.277
Well,
I'm having a dÃ©jÃ  vu again.

01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:21.547
I'll share it with you
if you want to hear it.

01:18:21.589 --> 01:18:23.355
Yes.

01:18:24.926 --> 01:18:26.292
I had a dream last night...

01:18:27.962 --> 01:18:30.322
and Mary Beth you were in it.

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:31.957
Really?

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.826
Yeah,
it wasn't anything terrible,

01:18:33.868 --> 01:18:35.561
but it came
with a word of caution

01:18:35.603 --> 01:18:37.797
and I wanted to share it
with you,

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:39.298
but I feel like, I might be jumping
into something that I shouldn't.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.133
But you know what?
I'm going to do it anyway.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:43.075
Now you got me really curious.

01:18:43.911 --> 01:18:46.512
I know that you two
have gotten...

01:18:47.582 --> 01:18:48.848
close.

01:18:50.117 --> 01:18:51.617
I knew something was coming...

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:56.188
but now I see
something else coming.

01:18:57.425 --> 01:18:58.557
What?

01:19:00.461 --> 01:19:01.427
History.

01:19:03.431 --> 01:19:05.331
I don't understand.

01:19:06.968 --> 01:19:09.902
I saw you running away,
Mary Beth.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.873
You've done that before.

01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:16.175
The time to stop...

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:18.544
running away...

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.140
is now.

01:19:21.182 --> 01:19:24.944
Now is the time
to run to people,

01:19:24.986 --> 01:19:28.053
places,
things with your eyes open...

01:19:29.423 --> 01:19:31.023
and your heart open.

01:19:33.261 --> 01:19:36.428
What... I have... I have
to go back to the tent now.

01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:44.003
I better go.

01:19:48.142 --> 01:19:49.441
Hey, hey.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.579
Love is there.

01:19:55.349 --> 01:19:56.575
Love is there.

01:20:17.571 --> 01:20:19.071
What happened?

01:20:20.708 --> 01:20:22.174
She knows.

01:20:23.945 --> 01:20:25.377
She knows that I...

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.314
I ran away from Barbara.

01:20:31.419 --> 01:20:33.452
That's what I do
when I'm scared.

01:20:34.689 --> 01:20:35.721
I run.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.192
I don't want to.

01:20:42.997 --> 01:20:44.396
I don't plan to.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.246
I don't want to hurt anyone.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:30.776
Deep thoughts?

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.141
Hey, it's Wanda.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.683
- How deep can they be?
- Don't, don't, don't.

01:21:39.086 --> 01:21:40.319
Remember, it's me.

01:21:43.057 --> 01:21:44.023
Yeah.

01:21:47.661 --> 01:21:49.762
It's just that
I have been thinking.

01:21:52.566 --> 01:21:54.033
You know, thinking a lot.

01:21:55.636 --> 01:21:56.802
Maybe too much...

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:01.066
about her.

01:22:01.108 --> 01:22:02.067
About...

01:22:02.109 --> 01:22:05.110
- Her...
- Her. Oh...

01:22:07.615 --> 01:22:12.351
You went on this trip, this
journey, to open up her world.

01:22:13.354 --> 01:22:14.420
My dear friend...

01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:17.556
she has opened yours.

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:21.660
When we were
in the meditation gardens...

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.596
I just saw this light
come over her.

01:22:27.201 --> 01:22:29.128
There's this woman there,
Laura who

01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:31.764
gave her a statue of the green
Tara, do you know it?

01:22:31.806 --> 01:22:33.499
Oh, I do.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:35.140
A powerful force.

01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:40.272
The Great Protectress,
compassionate force,

01:22:40.314 --> 01:22:42.541
who fuels all life,

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.850
addresses all your fears.

01:22:46.487 --> 01:22:48.220
I'm afraid, Davina.

01:22:51.492 --> 01:22:52.825
I'm afraid.

01:22:57.198 --> 01:22:59.364
I am afraid.
I've already let her in.

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:04.169
And then we'll go home and this
trip will end, and I'll just...

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:11.243
Oh, I've misread all the queues
and I'll just be alone again.

01:23:13.547 --> 01:23:16.642
You've only known her
a few months

01:23:16.684 --> 01:23:19.211
and how long have you been
on this trip?

01:23:19.253 --> 01:23:21.280
What? A week?

01:23:22.556 --> 01:23:25.124
I'm not putting
my psychic hat on.

01:23:25.893 --> 01:23:27.453
I'm putting my friend hat on.

01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:31.597
Just be.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.801
Just sit in the now-ness.

01:23:36.704 --> 01:23:37.870
Oh...

01:23:39.773 --> 01:23:43.609
You're ready to let someone
into your life, fully.

01:23:46.213 --> 01:23:49.481
- It scares you.
- Oh, it does.

01:23:55.589 --> 01:23:58.082
She is on the cusp.

01:23:58.124 --> 01:24:00.619
She is still getting
used to her own aloneness,

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:02.394
her own fears.

01:24:04.231 --> 01:24:05.564
She runs deeper.

01:24:10.771 --> 01:24:12.304
Let it unfold.

01:24:17.745 --> 01:24:19.344
Just let it unfold.

01:24:28.656 --> 01:24:30.682
You should have waited
so I could help you.

01:24:30.724 --> 01:24:32.691
Oh, it's no problem.

01:24:35.296 --> 01:24:36.254
Did you have a nice walk?

01:24:36.296 --> 01:24:37.256
Wanda, I have to say
something and I...

01:24:37.298 --> 01:24:39.431
I need you to listen
to understand.

01:24:40.801 --> 01:24:41.867
Oh.

01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:44.203
Okay.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.574
When Barbara sent me
that teapot, it was like...

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:52.811
someone turned the lights on.

01:24:54.682 --> 01:25:00.913
It was a much needed light in the middle
of everyone having to stay in their homes

01:25:00.955 --> 01:25:05.317
and Bill and I splitting up,
time to think.

01:25:05.359 --> 01:25:08.187
Way, way, too much
time to think.

01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:09.922
I think I know
what you're trying to say.

01:25:09.964 --> 01:25:12.324
You need to get home now.
You need a little space from me.

01:25:12.366 --> 01:25:15.267
- You need time for yourself.
- Listen, stop.

01:25:16.704 --> 01:25:20.432
I'm saying that this quest
with you has been like,

01:25:20.474 --> 01:25:24.009
the door slowly opening up
to reveal the light again.

01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:27.980
There's just a lot of pieces
in the air and...

01:25:28.983 --> 01:25:31.250
I need to see
how those pieces land.

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.513
It takes time.

01:25:34.555 --> 01:25:36.888
You know, one of the only
things I have is time.

01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:40.959
If you're in my life and you're here
to stay now that's all that matters.

01:25:42.296 --> 01:25:43.528
We are friends.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:45.757
It's not going to change.

01:25:48.502 --> 01:25:49.968
Let's go home.

01:25:51.538 --> 01:25:53.372
Heading home
has a nice ring to it.

01:26:31.745 --> 01:26:34.346
Hey, you know,
you didn't say a word all the way home.

01:26:36.383 --> 01:26:37.876
Thinking.

01:26:37.918 --> 01:26:40.912
Listen, I'm going to take
my bags in the bedroom.

01:26:40.954 --> 01:26:44.356
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you need to be home now.

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.358
See your kid.

01:26:47.561 --> 01:26:49.027
Sleep in your own bed.

01:26:50.464 --> 01:26:52.331
Sing real loud in the shower.

01:26:54.435 --> 01:26:57.669
I've, uh, never been inside
your house before.

01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:00.072
It's warm.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.736
Spotless.

01:27:04.778 --> 01:27:05.971
That's a relief.

01:27:06.013 --> 01:27:10.642
You know what? I'll go get the surplus
of toilet paper you left in my van.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:12.978
Oh, Wanda,
you don't need to do that.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.380
No, I'm going to go get it because if
I don't, you'll just order more online,

01:27:15.422 --> 01:27:16.982
and I'll have to deliver it
later anyway.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:19.524
- Fair enough.
- Get settled.

01:27:25.466 --> 01:27:26.565
Settled.

01:27:27.601 --> 01:27:29.901
Will I ever be settled again?

01:27:30.838 --> 01:27:35.734
Actually, I hope I never settle
again for anything?

01:27:35.776 --> 01:27:40.679
The only thing I want to go
back to is Kevin and now...

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:44.810
I'm back with your TP.

01:27:44.852 --> 01:27:47.946
I will trade you this TP
for a glass of wine.

01:27:47.988 --> 01:27:50.522
Oh! I'll take that trade.

01:27:55.929 --> 01:27:57.629
Your house is really great.

01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:13.512
- A musician too?
- Oh, like, no.

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:15.547
Thank you.

01:28:16.483 --> 01:28:17.642
To the journey.

01:28:17.684 --> 01:28:18.917
Yeah.

01:28:19.787 --> 01:28:21.052
Thanks.

01:28:22.723 --> 01:28:24.916
You know,
you just drove eight hours.

01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:27.386
I'm tired.
You have to be exhausted.

01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:28.760
Why don't you stay?

01:28:30.431 --> 01:28:31.523
Stay here?

01:28:31.565 --> 01:28:32.998
Yeah, get some sleep.

01:28:34.635 --> 01:28:37.629
Like a capping it off
with a slumber party?

01:28:37.671 --> 01:28:39.971
Okay. Yes.

01:28:41.508 --> 01:28:45.470
You know, if someone would
have told me a month ago that

01:28:45.512 --> 01:28:48.647
we were going to go on this
grand adventure and...

01:28:49.716 --> 01:28:53.478
and I was going to experience
that gorgeous meditation center

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.914
and camp with mountain lions,

01:28:55.956 --> 01:29:00.852
and have a psychic reading,
and watch a shooting star,

01:29:00.894 --> 01:29:04.830
I would have thought
it was the makings of a...

01:29:06.099 --> 01:29:08.099
an epic novel.

01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:15.607
But, Mary Beth,
you are back home again, and, uh...

01:29:16.944 --> 01:29:18.437
I need to talk to Kevin,

01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:22.814
assure him that he'll be okay and...
and I'll be okay.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.086
Why me?

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:31.716
What do you mean?

01:29:31.758 --> 01:29:35.494
Well, you thought about me
and...

01:29:36.497 --> 01:29:40.265
planned this this journey,
and cared for me.

01:29:42.035 --> 01:29:43.795
Why?

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:45.564
Hmm.

01:29:45.606 --> 01:29:47.772
I know what it's like
to feel lost.

01:29:49.810 --> 01:29:52.110
You know, years ago...

01:29:53.514 --> 01:29:55.680
I met someone
who taught me that life...

01:29:56.817 --> 01:29:58.283
is actually pretty simple.

01:30:00.153 --> 01:30:03.154
It can be quite joyous
if we just let joy be.

01:30:04.758 --> 01:30:07.152
She taught me to stay present,

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:09.027
be kind, do no harm...

01:30:10.197 --> 01:30:11.656
and to never look back.

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:12.764
Above all...

01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:14.933
not to look back.

01:30:16.904 --> 01:30:18.970
Plus, I just love
being with you.

01:30:20.307 --> 01:30:22.007
I love being with you too.

01:30:23.844 --> 01:30:28.680
And on that note,
I am going to top us off with some wine.

01:30:31.318 --> 01:30:33.545
It was Davina, wasn't it?

01:30:33.587 --> 01:30:34.586
It was.

01:30:35.923 --> 01:30:37.249
Were you lovers?

01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:40.559
No, she took me in
when I needed taking in.

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:46.224
Hey, why don't we get into our jammies
and get the slumber party started?

01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:47.926
Oh, Wanda, only you.

01:30:47.968 --> 01:30:49.227
- Jammies?
- Yeah.

01:30:49.269 --> 01:30:50.602
Okay.

01:30:51.271 --> 01:30:52.931
I'm going to get mine
from the RV.

01:30:52.973 --> 01:30:55.567
And I'm going to get
my jammies on.

01:30:55.609 --> 01:30:58.109
- Get your jammies on.
- Okay.

01:31:11.325 --> 01:31:13.158
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:31:14.995 --> 01:31:16.254
Bend your knees.

01:31:16.296 --> 01:31:18.730
- What?
- Just...

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.299
Yeah.
