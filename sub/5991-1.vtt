"Despite certain similarities to the real events, this film is purely
fictional and does not represent real-life persons or situations."

00:28.628 --> 00:31.096
-Get those people out of the way!
-Go! Go! Go!

00:31.164 --> 00:33.291
The President has been shot!

00:33.366 --> 00:36.665
There were at least three gunshots.
There appear to be at least...

00:37.237 --> 00:39.831
Get those people out of the fucking way.
Let's go!

00:39.906 --> 00:41.271
I'm all right.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.502
To the van. Let's go! Let's go!

00:44.044 --> 00:45.841
Was anyone else hit?

00:46.813 --> 00:49.907
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:49.983 --> 00:52.451
-Call my wife. Tell her I'm okay.
-He got through security.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.248
Repeat, he got through security.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.151
-Tell her I'm okay.
-We will, Mr. President.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.211
-God damn it!
-We'll call her.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.962
MSNBC has confirmed
that a few minutes ago,

01:05.031 --> 01:08.262
US war planes struck military bases
in Venezuela

01:08.334 --> 01:13.169
in retaliation for the assassination attempt
on President Lyman three weeks ago.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.764
Our Emily Boyd is on the ground in Caracas.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.867
Emily, what are you hearing now?

01:17.944 --> 01:21.038
Jim, as you can imagine, the situation
on the ground in Caracas

01:21.114 --> 01:23.878
can be described as a state of chaos.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.416
Apparently, President Lyman responded
to a CIA report

01:27.487 --> 01:30.513
said to have overwhelmingly
and conclusively asserted

01:30.590 --> 01:33.718
Venezuela's involvement
in the assassination attempt.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.851
President Lopez's government...

01:34.928 --> 01:39.160
Four bottles of milk on the wall
Four bottles of milk

01:39.432 --> 01:44.734
You take one down, you pass it around
Three bottles of milk on the wall

01:44.938 --> 01:47.202
Three bottles of milk on the wall

01:47.273 --> 01:48.672
Oh, my God, this song.

01:48.741 --> 01:52.074
Is this what we got in trouble for
in Abu Ghraib?

01:53.413 --> 01:58.180
I don't know why anybody actually signed
up to be a room mother.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.377
Yeah.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.455
Hey, Timmy!

02:06.659 --> 02:09.025
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, Mom.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.466
Can you just, like,
sing along with everybody else?

02:15.535 --> 02:17.594
I don't have a good voice.

02:18.104 --> 02:21.437
Well, me, neither. Come on, sing along.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.970
Come on.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.272
-Mrs. Robinson?
-Yeah, what is it, dear?

02:26.346 --> 02:29.907
Nicky Ludlow keeps pulling on my hair,
and he won't stop.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.917
Well, just switch seats.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.885
But the bus is full.

02:33.953 --> 02:38.515
You know what, just stay right here. Okay?
I'll deal with it.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.286
You're a tattletale!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.988
-I am not!
-You just told on Nicky.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.223
That's because he won't stop.

02:45.298 --> 02:48.267
-You're a tattletale.
-Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.700
-That's enough.
-But you're not supposed to tattle.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.729
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up with bullies, either.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.805
Come on.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.369
Capital Sun Times.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.970
It's gonna be the Redskins.

03:02.048 --> 03:04.710
You know what you call 53 people
watching the Super Bowl?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.445
-No, sir.
-The Washington Redskins.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.781
That's what you call them.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.344
Larry, you should be supporting
the home team.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.912
I would support the North Koreans

03:10.990 --> 03:12.480
if they were playing
the Washington Redskins.

03:12.559 --> 03:16.359
All right, Judy, give it four hours
as top story on the Net, I guess.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.158
-Thank you, B.B.
-That's it, boss. I think.

03:18.231 --> 03:21.598
Okay. Thanks, everybody.
Let's make it a good one.

03:21.668 --> 03:25.195
Let me ask you a question.
How many Olympians do we have in town?

03:25.271 --> 03:26.465
Oh, quite a few.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.570
Rache, stick around a minute, would you?

03:31.044 --> 03:34.275
You know there's that track star, right?
From Georgetown?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.747
-Yeah.
-Okay, get on him, too, all right?

03:36.849 --> 03:38.714
-Get the door for me, would you, Kelly?
-No problem.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.013
Thanks.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.756
Okay, Rache.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.727
We're gonna fast track the story. Your story.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.787
Really? When?

03:51.864 --> 03:53.855
The New York Times has gotten hold
of some of the information,

03:53.933 --> 03:54.957
so we're going to beat them to the punch.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.366
Yeah.
Want to get it on the doorsteps tomorrow.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.302
I mean, it's a killer story.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.273
No, I know. It's Watergate. It's lran-Contra.

04:02.342 --> 04:03.673
It mean, it's a "holy shit" piece, Bonnie.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.301
-It's gonna take them down.
-Rachel.

04:05.378 --> 04:10.315
-Sorry. Gotta rein it in. I'm kind of excited.
-Okay, we gotta remain objective.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.841
Well, fine. We'll objectively bring down
the White House.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.218
What else do you need to do
to finish the story?

04:16.289 --> 04:20.385
I gotta call the White House.
Of course, go to Van Doren herself.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.485
Out of curiosity,
why haven't you spoken to her yet?

04:23.563 --> 04:25.292
Avril, I already told you,

04:25.365 --> 04:28.766
if we went to her too early,
we give the ClA time to shut the story down.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.894
We go now, there's nothing they can do.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.905
Okay. Look, legally the story is solid.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.300
Everything is factually in line.
There's no libel.

04:36.376 --> 04:39.311
Well, that's all that's important, right?

04:41.681 --> 04:45.242
I wish you would let me know
who your source is on this.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.713
A title, a job description.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.156
Okay, look,
we have two confirming sources.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.787
Rachel told me who they are,
and I'm comfortable with them.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.889
We have Van Doren's letter
to the ClA director

04:59.966 --> 05:01.558
that the Feds gave to Rachel.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.727
-That's enough to go to press.
-It's your flip of the coin.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.237
I'm just saying
that what you guys are okay with,

05:06.306 --> 05:09.036
the government may not be.
The laws are murky.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.000
I'm sorry, what?

05:11.077 --> 05:12.635
It's illegal for a government official

05:12.712 --> 05:15.306
to reveal the identity
of an undercover ClA agent.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.746
Okay. Well, I'm not a government official.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.477
I don't understand why you're bringing...
You know what?

05:18.551 --> 05:20.314
We've already discussed this.
Bonnie's signed off on it.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.751
As long as we all know
what we're dealing with.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.152
All right, we know.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.656
Okay, do you know how to find her?
Van Doren?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.625
Yeah.
I'll go to her as soon as I get out of here.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.595
Our kids go to school together,
if you can believe that.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.631
-No shit?
-Yeah.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.758
Okay, you feel comfortable
going to her for comment?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.202
Absolutely.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.599
Yeah! That's it! Come on! Pass it in!

05:39.572 --> 05:41.904
-Stay open, Ali!
-Angela, pass it to me.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.638
I got it! I got it!

05:45.545 --> 05:47.809
Come on now! Push up! Push up!

05:48.915 --> 05:50.849
Yes, Ali! Good job! Good job!

05:52.318 --> 05:53.808
Kick it, honey! Kick it hard!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.444
Good pass!

05:57.390 --> 05:59.654
Spread out, girls! Spread out!

06:02.929 --> 06:04.521
Get in there! Come on!

06:05.431 --> 06:06.864
-Hey.
-Hello.

06:09.535 --> 06:13.733
Oh, no. Defense! Come on, defense! Allison.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.468
-She's doing great out there.
-Yeah.

06:18.344 --> 06:21.438
-Every one of them chases the ball.
-Well, nobody likes defense.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.141
Come on, Ali! Come on.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.310
-She is in Mr. Cody's class. Right?
-Yeah.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.946
-Yeah, my son, too.
-I see.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.554
-Come on, Allison.
-There you go, there you go, honey!

06:32.625 --> 06:34.593
Could we talk in private?

06:34.660 --> 06:37.322
I'm with the Sun Times,
I need a few minutes.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.297
It's kind of important.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.764
Yeah. Sure.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.465
I'm just concerned
she might have seen me slip away.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.511
-I won't keep you long.
-Okay. So, what's up?

06:52.812 --> 06:56.612
Erica, I'm writing a story.
I work for the national desk.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.115
-Okay?
-Neat.

06:58.184 --> 07:01.813
And it's gonna run tomorrow,
and it's gonna say, among other things,

07:01.888 --> 07:04.083
that you are a ClA operative,

07:04.557 --> 07:08.459
and that you went on a mission,
a fact-finding mission to Venezuela.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.928
What? This is...

07:10.997 --> 07:12.692
Hear me out, okay?

07:13.466 --> 07:15.127
You went there on a fact-finding mission

07:15.201 --> 07:16.930
to determine if its government
was responsible

07:17.003 --> 07:19.369
for the assassination attempt
on President Lyman.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.169
You determined it was not,
and you informed your bosses of this.

07:22.241 --> 07:25.438
This is the stupidest B.S. I have ever heard.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.342
Wait, wait. What? Can you...

07:27.413 --> 07:29.005
How do I know
that you're from the Sun Times?

07:29.081 --> 07:32.380
The White House ignored your findings
and launched an attack anyway,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.250
still claiming retribution
for the assassination attempt.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.380
I've been on the national desk for five years.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.851
I have a column every Tuesday
on the editorial page.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.421
My son goes to school here, too.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.623
Yeah, I know. You said that.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.567
You people.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.838
You people! My God! You fucking people!

07:53.906 --> 07:57.706
You know, this isn't about me.
Once again, it's about my husband.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.108
My source is impeccable.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.806
Your source is 1 10% fucking peccable.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.647
I'm a ClA operative?

08:05.718 --> 08:10.485
I can't even use the navigation system
in my Prius. This is... This is absurd!

08:10.957 --> 08:14.586
Your paper... Your paper has been trying
to fuck my husband

08:14.660 --> 08:16.560
ever since he spoke out
against this administration.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.028
-We have your memo.
-What memo?

08:18.097 --> 08:21.066
-We have your findings.
-You know. My attorney is Harry Timmers.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.828
-Do you know him?
-Sure.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.097
He's gonna take a lead pipe to you,
and he's gonna shove it up your ass.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.605
Well, I certainly don't want that.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.268
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Our kids go to school together, Robin.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.335
-Rachel Armstrong.
-Right. Whatever.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.538
Are you denying you're ClA?

08:34.614 --> 08:39.278
You know what? You stay away from us.
Okay? I mean it.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.917
Just say that the White House
doesn't comment on security issues.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.790
Is that what you're saying?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.488
Come on, David.
Give me something I can spell.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.087
Off the record, this is bullshit.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.631
You're gonna set off a shit storm
for nothing,

08:53.699 --> 08:55.724
for a lousy column inch of space.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.463
-Rachel, it's your son on line five.
-You're gonna have egg on your face.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.837
I gotta go, David.
I got my son on the other line.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.437
Hey, kiddo.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.774
Hi, Mom. Did you get my paper?

09:07.446 --> 09:10.813
Yeah, I'm just getting it now.
Can I read it and call you back?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.408
Okay, but I gotta go to bed soon.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.011
Okay.
Well, you can wait up for me to call you.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.522
But Dad said I had to go to bed.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.118
Well, we'll do it in the morning. I promise.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.251
Okay.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.263
It's just, I have a real big story, honey.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.122
It's fine, Mom.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.366
Okay, I love you. Bye-bye.

09:30.436 --> 09:32.529
-Sorry.
-Hey, what's that?

09:32.605 --> 09:36.166
My son had to do a paper on lndia.
I was just looking over his outline.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.734
I bet you he could give me 10 inches
on lndia's nuclear buildup with Pakistan.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.609
-Oh, yeah.
-How'd you do with David?

09:41.681 --> 09:44.775
"White House doesn't comment
on security issues." Blah-blah.

09:44.850 --> 09:48.308
Yeah, well, I know you'll give it
more eloquent phrasing than "blah-blah."

09:48.387 --> 09:50.252
-Sure.
-Feels good, huh?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.950
It's worth every dime I don't make.

09:52.024 --> 09:55.687
Look, I want you to start
on a major profile of Van Doren,

09:55.761 --> 10:00.130
from Yale to ClA, to the marriage
to the ambassador 20 years older than her.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.362
He was her professor. He was married.
A whole drama, I hear.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.563
Now, that's some good stuff.

10:05.638 --> 10:09.096
Look, by the way,
you deserve a good night's sleep.

10:09.175 --> 10:12.303
If I were you,
I'd turn the ringers on my phone off.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.317
Hey, Erica.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.017
-Why are we meeting here, Merrill?
-For the chili.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.123
No. Why are we meeting out
in the open like this?

10:27.193 --> 10:30.492
We're not out in the open, Erica.
No one knows who you are.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.088
Now tomorrow,
when that goddamn story comes out,

10:33.165 --> 10:37.101
tomorrow you'll be out in the open. Shit!

10:37.169 --> 10:39.899
Your husband had to go
and write those articles, didn't he?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.098
Keep him out of this.

10:41.173 --> 10:44.199
You're right, Erica. It's not Oscar's fault.

10:44.777 --> 10:49.407
Oscar hasn't been trained in covert ops.
Oscar didn't take an oath of secrecy.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.814
No, it's your fault.
You shouldn't have told him anything.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.843
Okay, hey, guys. Here's the SlTREP.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.288
The paper will be out in two hours.
They haven't put it up on the Net.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.019
They didn't want to give
the West Coast papers a chance

11:01.093 --> 11:03.755
to put it in their morning editions.
And Justice is scrambling.

11:03.829 --> 11:07.321
They're bringing in a special prosecutor
to find out who exposed you.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.231
I can't believe this.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.562
I mean, our kids go to school together,

11:13.939 --> 11:16.601
you know, the reporter's kid and mine.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.701
Wait a second. You know her?

11:18.844 --> 11:23.941
Well, I kind of recognized her today,
but we'd never spoken before that moment.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.917
Let me ask you straight out, Erica.
Was it you?

11:26.986 --> 11:29.921
-Was it me, what?
-Was it you who leaked to the Sun Times?

11:29.989 --> 11:31.581
I mean, it's understandable.

11:31.657 --> 11:35.149
The White House ignored your report,
and you got pissed.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.759
You goaded Oscar to write
those quote-unquote, opinion pieces.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.731
When that didn't get traction,
you went to the press yourself.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.233
I went to the press myself.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.963
Someone you knew. Someone you trusted.

11:45.571 --> 11:46.868
Fuck you.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.764
Fuck me? Touche.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.271
The prosecutor, Patton Dubois,
he'll be in tomorrow.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.939
He'll get Armstrong before the grand jury.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.950
Law says
Armstrong has to give up her source.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.280
Could it have been Oscar?

12:00.352 --> 12:02.877
No. Could it have been you, O'Hara?

12:04.457 --> 12:07.290
How we all doing? Still doing good?

12:07.359 --> 12:08.587
-Doing good.
-You sure?

12:08.661 --> 12:10.322
-Good.
-All right.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.454
I'm gonna put you on the box. Oscar, too.

12:12.531 --> 12:16.558
Fine. But I want everybody in the agency
who knows my identity,

12:17.069 --> 12:19.594
I want them with polygraph wires
up their asses, too,

12:19.672 --> 12:20.934
because there's a traitor among us.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.372
We'll find that person if they're in the ClA.

12:23.442 --> 12:26.673
Nonetheless, we should think about
relocating you for your own good.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.579
No. No.
I will send Allison away for a little while,

12:29.648 --> 12:33.675
but none of this shit was my fault.
I'm not gonna be punished.

12:33.953 --> 12:36.353
This Lois Lane and her newspaper,

12:36.422 --> 12:39.289
I'm not gonna let her turn me
into a scared little girl.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.019
I'm staying here.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.291
Whatever.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.889
In the meantime, we'll assign
a protective detail to your home.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.868
I feel so much safer. Thank you.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.802
I can't fucking believe this.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.942
Mommy.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.787
-Wanna stay home from school today?
-Yeah.

13:48.427 --> 13:52.090
This is very interesting. It's awesome.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.461
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Wow.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.034
I didn't realize they made
so much coffee in lndia.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.299
It also has the most democrats in the world.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.831
Well, not quite.
India is the biggest democracy in the world.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.606
-lsn't that the same thing?
-No, it's not the same thing.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.170
Jesus Christ.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.180
Don't give your carrots to Brandon today.
Okay?

14:16.255 --> 14:17.847
Okay, Mom.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.051
You did it.

14:22.127 --> 14:25.722
This changes everything.
You're gonna win a Pulitzer.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.623
I don't know about that.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.837
-Timmy, come on. Eat your breakfast.
-I don't like them.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.002
Come on, don't give Mommy a hard time.
Finish your eggs.

14:39.078 --> 14:42.343
-Eggs give you cancer.
-Eggs don't give you cancer.

14:42.414 --> 14:46.316
All right, you know what?
I'll finish your cancer, okay. Okay?

14:48.387 --> 14:51.845
Feels pretty good though.
That was a lot of work.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.053
You didn't tell me half the stuff
that's in here.

14:56.128 --> 15:00.622
Well, you don't tell me anything
that goes into your novels, so it's fair.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.326
A spokesman for the newspaper says

15:02.401 --> 15:05.928
because her husband is a Vocal opponent
of the administration,

15:06.005 --> 15:10.032
this makes Mrs. Van Doren's employment
with the CIA absolutely newsworthy.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.077
-Mom?
-In Mexico City...

15:13.279 --> 15:16.407
-What's up, kiddo?
-Can we go to the zoo today?

15:16.482 --> 15:19.110
To the zoo? It's a school day.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.084
Maybe we can go tonight?

15:21.153 --> 15:23.451
Well, the animals are sleeping at night.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.217
You don't want to mess
with sleeping animals.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.316
They might be a bit cranky.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.961
Okay, come on, sweetie,
you're gonna be late.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.796
-You got your stuff?
-You want to finish it?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.529
Great, thank you.

15:42.207 --> 15:47.645
Hey. Come on, you're forgetting.
Give me a kiss.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.441
I love you. Have a good day.

15:52.418 --> 15:53.817
Hey, Connor.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.489
I'm sorry, you scared the hell out of me.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.993
I'm Special Agent Coddington.
I'm with the FBl.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.359
We need you to come with us, please.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.658
What for?

16:05.731 --> 16:09.929
I don't know, ma'am. They just asked me
to come here and pick you up.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.664
Hey there, Miss Armstrong. Come on in.

16:14.573 --> 16:18.304
I'm Patton Dubois, federal prosecutor.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.208
Please come on in. Thanks for coming by.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.803
Did I have a choice?

16:21.880 --> 16:23.575
Of course you did.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.477
I don't have anything to say,

16:26.552 --> 16:29.851
so if you have a problem,
contact my editors.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.446
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

16:32.524 --> 16:34.116
No, thank you.

16:34.193 --> 16:36.286
Sure, sir, I'm gonna take some.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.387
Great scoop, by the way.

16:38.697 --> 16:42.155
If this doesn't make your career,
God knows what will.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.363
Holy moly.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.005
That was something.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.706
Well, I'm gonna be announced in a few days,

16:52.778 --> 16:55.076
just as soon as
all the paperwork goes through,

16:55.147 --> 17:00.312
as the special counsel to investigate
this leak about Erica Van Doren.

17:01.053 --> 17:05.079
-That was fast.
-Yeah, I know, it's kind of unusual,

17:05.156 --> 17:09.594
but the boys over at Justice seem to think
this is a pretty urgent matter,

17:09.661 --> 17:11.652
a not-a-second-to-lose kind of thing.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.290
So they called me in last night,

17:14.366 --> 17:18.462
and I just checked into the hotel
this morning, and here we are.

17:19.003 --> 17:22.496
The Attorney General's office
has to disqualify itself.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.974
Maybe somebody over there
was your source, eh?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.877
-I think I should call my lawyer.
-That's not necessary.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.916
I'm not gonna be asking you any questions.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.012
Not here, anyway.
This is neither the time nor the place.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.349
I just wanted to get
kind of an unofficial head start.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.529
Can I talk to you off the record?

17:46.832 --> 17:47.958
Sure.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.760
I mean, a just-between-you-and-me
kind of thing.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.728
Off the record is off the record.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.572
Okay, good. I'll do all the yada-yada.

17:59.011 --> 18:03.710
Now, you were within your rights
to print the information that you obtained.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.511
However, you're not within your rights

18:05.584 --> 18:09.953
to protect who it was
that gave Erica up to you, who exposed her.

18:10.189 --> 18:14.717
It's a 1982 law called
the lntelligence ldentities Protection Act.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.285
Your source is in a great deal of trouble.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.262
-I've no intention of discussing my source...
-Hold on.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.765
I'm doing the yada-yada, remember?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.393
Okay.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.603
Okay, look,

18:26.705 --> 18:29.333
you're gonna be asked
to appear before a grand jury.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.399
You're gonna be asked
to identify your source.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.774
I'll be doing the asking.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.679
Now, if, for some reason,
you don't reveal your source,

18:36.748 --> 18:39.615
you'll be held in contempt,
and that means jail time,

18:39.685 --> 18:42.848
and we're not talking about
some sort of a Martha Stewart cell

18:42.921 --> 18:44.912
with a butler, nonsense.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.919
Look.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.828
Rachel, go to your source.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.495
Ask him to permit you to reveal his name.

18:56.568 --> 19:00.060
You may be surprised
at his willingness to protect you.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.538
People are inherently decent, I have found.

19:07.279 --> 19:11.613
Well, if that were true,
that would put you out of a job, no?

19:16.021 --> 19:19.388
Well, that's all I've got to say.
You'll be notified of your court date.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.756
I'm afraid I'm gonna disappoint you,
Mr. Dubois.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.262
That's not possible.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.665
-You ready? Here she is.
-Here she is.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.863
Ready to roll?

19:33.939 --> 19:35.201
Rolling.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.141
Hey, Erica,
why do you think your report was ignored?

19:38.210 --> 19:42.203
Is Erica your real name?
How long have you been with the agency?

19:42.481 --> 19:44.779
All right, I know you're trying
to do your jobs, okay.

19:44.850 --> 19:49.446
I'd love to speak to you.
Now is not a good time.

19:49.821 --> 19:52.085
I have an appointment here
to read to the kids.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.283
Is Erica your real name?

19:53.358 --> 19:55.622
Did you give your husband
top-secret information?

19:55.694 --> 19:57.889
Does your family know that you're here?

19:57.963 --> 19:59.828
You know, I'm a mom.

20:02.334 --> 20:05.826
If this CIA report exists,
as the Sun Times claims it does,

20:05.904 --> 20:07.701
that would seem to indicate
the President launched

20:07.773 --> 20:10.537
a full-fledged act of war in Venezuela

20:10.609 --> 20:11.598
-without justification...
-Thanks.

20:11.677 --> 20:14.271
-Really nice work.
-...and just based on his own gut instinct.

20:14.346 --> 20:17.713
It would also mean that either the President
lied to the nation and the Congress...

20:17.783 --> 20:20.775
Hey, Rache, they're waiting for you
in Bonnie's office.

20:20.852 --> 20:24.913
...what is arguably the worst foreign policy
decision in this nation's history.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.787
So far, the White House
is standing by its actions,

20:26.858 --> 20:27.950
but they're not denying the report.

20:28.026 --> 20:29.789
-Rachel.
-Yeah, I'm going.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.726
-Kick-ass story, by the way.
-Thank you.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.492
...there's a reason to question the findings.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.033
"'Wait for me. Wait for me.
I'm a fast runner,' said Ruthie.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.898
"'And I'd sure like to catch something great,'

20:37.970 --> 20:39.733
"she added, with a fishing pole in hand.

20:39.805 --> 20:44.504
"So off they went. Up a hill,
down a path, through a grove of trees,

20:44.576 --> 20:49.946
"and just as Granny Annie was about to
tell Ruthie what she was going to catch..."

20:50.148 --> 20:53.640
If I'd been a little bit more forceful with you
and Larry, saying don't rush this to press,

20:53.719 --> 20:55.016
maybe we wouldn't be in this situation.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.784
I told you, the government's gonna take this
very seriously. I told...

20:58.857 --> 21:01.849
The next time the FBl hauls you
into a fucking interrogation,

21:01.927 --> 21:04.361
-your first goddamn phone call is to me!
-I got it. I'm sorry.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.263
Before you even take off
your fucking seat belt, you call me!

21:08.634 --> 21:10.295
All right, Avril.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.504
You okay?

21:13.572 --> 21:18.236
Yeah, I was dropping Timmy off at school,
and the FBl were there,

21:18.310 --> 21:20.642
and they asked me to go with them and...

21:20.712 --> 21:23.545
Pretty unnerving, huh?
Being questioned like that.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.976
-lt was really fast.
-They want your source, right?

21:27.052 --> 21:31.045
Yeah. I didn't give it to them.
I won't give it to them. No way.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.156
Okay, please.

21:38.830 --> 21:43.062
First of all, this is appalling behavior
on the part of the FBl.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.298
Snatching you in front of your kid.
Strong-arming you.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.703
I want to know the name of the agent
that interviewed you.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.800
Well, it wasn't an FBl agent.
It was this guy Patton Dubois.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.710
He's being appointed special prosecutor.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.182
What? You know him?

21:59.651 --> 22:00.709
No.

22:01.286 --> 22:04.221
No. But a special prosecutor,
that's no good.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.124
See, his only requirement
is to find your source,

22:07.192 --> 22:08.682
with nothing else to divert him.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.389
He's gonna have unlimited time,
unlimited moolah,

22:12.464 --> 22:13.954
and the chance of unlimited publicity.

22:14.032 --> 22:17.729
There's a lot more investigative power for
a special prosecutor than there is for a Fed.

22:17.803 --> 22:21.204
Yeah, well, not enough power
to make me reveal my source.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.833
I have a right to protect my source.

22:26.111 --> 22:27.135
-What?
-The federal government

22:27.212 --> 22:31.478
doesn't have a shield law.
Not on issues of national security.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.041
49 states do have some form of protection
for journalists,

22:34.119 --> 22:36.485
-but not the federal government.
-The administration will back off

22:36.555 --> 22:38.682
when they see how far we will go
to protect Rachel.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.783
The federal government is fighting
for a principle, too.

22:41.860 --> 22:46.092
You see, somebody revealed
top secret information to you.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.860
That is an act of treason.
That is how they see it.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.664
They're gonna take this very, very seriously.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.968
Yeah, well, so am l,
gonna take it very seriously.

22:57.743 --> 22:59.472
-Officer, what's the hold-up?
-Sorry, ma'am.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.203
Are you kidding? My house is right there.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.078
-She's on the list.
-All right, go ahead.

23:10.522 --> 23:13.082
I want a half-hour of reading every day.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.523
-You hear me?
-Am I going to get into trouble

23:14.593 --> 23:16.959
-for not going to school?
-No.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.155
-I'll miss my friends.
-I know you will,

23:19.231 --> 23:20.391
but it's just gonna be for a little while.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.932
You're gonna have a private tutor.
He's really great.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.230
You'll love him. I promise. Kisses.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.734
Butterfly kiss, Eskimo kiss.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.700
I love you.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.075
I told you this would happen.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.480
-You just don't get it, do you?
-This is your fault.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.642
What do you want to listen to, baby?

23:39.718 --> 23:41.709
Who's your best friend?

23:42.020 --> 23:43.510
-Who?
-You!

23:50.262 --> 23:51.354
Bye!

24:07.579 --> 24:09.479
Are we off the record?

24:11.049 --> 24:14.018
Sure. I'll meet you in the back.

24:23.695 --> 24:27.426
You didn't come here to kick my ass,
did you? 'Cause it's not fair.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.228
I'm not trained in that whole,

24:29.301 --> 24:32.361
"Knock somebody's nose into their brain
with the palm of my hand," thing.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.371
No, I use poison darts.

24:35.941 --> 24:37.135
Funny.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.479
I like your mums.
The yellow ones are very cheerful.

24:45.450 --> 24:46.940
Thank you.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.282
Is your husband still writing?

24:49.821 --> 24:53.689
Yeah, all the time. Every day.

24:53.758 --> 24:58.559
I read his novel about the Mossad.
I read it while I was on vacation. It was...

24:59.631 --> 25:01.622
It was very entertaining.

25:03.201 --> 25:07.831
Thank you.
He's just trying to get out the second one.

25:10.475 --> 25:11.601
So...

25:15.480 --> 25:17.948
I'm sorry I lost my cool with you.

25:18.617 --> 25:22.383
Usually it takes a man
to bring out the heinous bitch in me.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.987
Oscar and l...

25:29.327 --> 25:32.091
It's probably it, you know,
the dagger and all.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.825
He's gone. He left.

25:36.501 --> 25:39.993
We had it out,
and he went to go stay with Allison

25:40.071 --> 25:42.539
'cause we had to send her away, too.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.665
Allison's a great kid.

25:45.577 --> 25:46.976
She seems very grounded.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.105
How do you know her?
You been digging in her past, too?

25:50.181 --> 25:52.979
No. No, I'm a room mother.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.987
Room mother? Man.
You should get hazard pay for that.

25:57.923 --> 26:02.758
I come in once every two weeks to read
to the kids. It's a big production.

26:02.827 --> 26:03.816
-Mom?
-I love it.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.260
I'm outside, Timmy!

26:06.498 --> 26:07.624
What can I do for you?

26:07.699 --> 26:11.533
I know you can't tell me who your source is.
I respect that. Okay?

26:11.603 --> 26:13.833
I know about keeping secrets.

26:14.906 --> 26:18.865
Just tell me yes or no. All right? Is...

26:19.811 --> 26:21.870
Is it someone close to me?

26:23.181 --> 26:24.341
Is it?

26:25.951 --> 26:28.010
Is it someone I work with?

26:28.553 --> 26:30.953
I can't tell you anything.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.051
You know what?

26:36.127 --> 26:39.619
When you go before the grand jury,
you will have to speak.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.495
-You are an unpatriotic little cunt...
-Okay.

26:41.566 --> 26:44.194
...who's gonna walk right off the plank
into the bowels of hell.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.499
-Do you know that?
-I hear that every day.

26:46.571 --> 26:49.768
If you want to go on record,
we'll give you amazing placement.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.502
Thank you.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.840
-What?
-Hi, Mrs. Van Doren.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.346
Hello, handsome. How are you?

26:56.414 --> 27:00.851
How's Allison doing?
She hasn't been in school. Is she sick?

27:02.053 --> 27:04.578
No, no, no. She is great. She's...

27:04.656 --> 27:06.521
She's just spending time with a relative.

27:06.591 --> 27:09.822
-Can you tell her I said hi?
-You bet. Yes, I will.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.334
Is it the door?

27:34.085 --> 27:35.382
Yeah?

27:35.453 --> 27:38.047
-Rachel Armstrong?
-What do you need?

27:38.123 --> 27:39.647
I'm here to serve you, ma'am.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.988
I just barely had time to type that up
and get over here.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.052
-ls it okay? Does it make sense to you?
-Yeah.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.428
I thought the law was supposed
to move slowly?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.228
Except for when it doesn't.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.996
Hey, this is all bullshit,
barging in on you in the middle of the night,

27:52.070 --> 27:54.698
dragging you into the Mayflower,
it's all just meant to intimidate you.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.865
It's working.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.670
-Well, don't let it intimidate you. Okay?
-Okay.

27:58.743 --> 28:00.768
You're gonna be fine.

28:01.446 --> 28:02.845
Miss Armstrong.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.074
Okay, I'll be down in the lobby.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.912
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

28:06.885 --> 28:11.049
Rachel Alice Armstrong.
15 Trinity Pass, Washington, D.C.

28:11.122 --> 28:13.818
Thanks. Okay, Miss Armstrong.

28:13.892 --> 28:17.851
You work as a reporter
for the Capital Sun Times, is that correct?

28:17.929 --> 28:19.021
Yes.

28:19.798 --> 28:23.791
As the national political correspondent,
is that right?

28:24.369 --> 28:27.031
-I am, yes. One of them.
-Okay, good.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.835
Okay, great. I'm batting a thousand.

28:30.909 --> 28:34.538
You wrote an article a few days ago, here,

28:34.612 --> 28:37.706
in which you revealed Erica Van Doren,

28:37.782 --> 28:41.479
married to the former US ambassador,
Oscar Van Doren,

28:41.553 --> 28:44.317
that she was a covert ClA operative.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.413
I did, yes.

28:45.490 --> 28:49.256
And you feel confident
with this story's veracity?

28:49.327 --> 28:50.692
I do, 100%%.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.895
Who was your source?

28:58.670 --> 29:01.230
-Miss Armstrong...
-One second. I'm sorry.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.331
"l respectfully refuse
to answer that question

29:03.408 --> 29:05.035
"on the grounds
that it would violate my rights

29:05.110 --> 29:08.307
"under the First Amendment
and federal common law."

29:10.749 --> 29:13.445
You're aware that anybody
with official knowledge

29:13.518 --> 29:16.043
of the identity of a ClA operative

29:16.121 --> 29:19.420
is forbidden by law
to release that information?

29:19.824 --> 29:21.189
I am, yes.

29:21.726 --> 29:23.751
So, who was your source?

29:23.828 --> 29:25.455
I can't reveal my source...

29:25.530 --> 29:27.657
Okay, look, Miss Armstrong.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.559
This is a very serious matter.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.866
I want you to take your time.

29:34.506 --> 29:39.239
We're gonna take a recess
and come back at, say, 1:30.

29:40.145 --> 29:43.512
I want you to go home.
I want you to talk to your family.

29:43.581 --> 29:46.345
I want you to talk to your editor. Okay?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.720
And then I want you to talk to your source.

29:50.288 --> 29:54.622
Mull it over and see if you all think
this is worth a contempt citation,

29:54.692 --> 29:56.819
and then we're gonna reconvene,

29:56.895 --> 29:59.455
and then I'm going to ask you again.

30:00.865 --> 30:01.889
I wouldn't hold your breath.

30:01.966 --> 30:05.333
Well, I'm not the one
that'll need to hold my breath.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.869
Okay, everybody,

30:10.942 --> 30:14.179
we're gonna break it up.
We'll come back at 1:30.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.212
-How long have you been in the ClA?
-Ms. Van Doren...

30:24.923 --> 30:26.515
"'Can I come too?' asked Charlie.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.526
"'l promise to help you catch
whatever it is,' he said.

30:29.594 --> 30:31.824
"'Come on,' said Ruthie Joe
and Granny Annie.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.625
"So off they went across the bridge..."

30:33.698 --> 30:35.689
My watch says I'm early.

30:36.935 --> 30:41.372
We just feel like this is not the best time
for you to be with the kids.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.334
It's just that,

30:43.408 --> 30:47.538
you know, we're really not equipped
to deal with a lot of craziness.

30:47.612 --> 30:48.738
Okay.

30:49.247 --> 30:52.580
I think it's idiotic, is what it is.
I understand, the press can be a nightmare.

30:52.650 --> 30:56.848
Maybe if you were to stay away for a while,
then they would go away.

30:57.322 --> 31:00.814
I hope we can work this out, Jerry.
I really look forward to reading to the kids.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.520
I mean, I'm pretty good at it, too.
I do all the little voices.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.529
You are. So...

31:05.597 --> 31:09.055
When were you planning
on bringing Ali back to school?

31:10.235 --> 31:12.032
I don't know. I'm not sure.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.537
I see. Okay.

31:18.409 --> 31:21.546
Are you saying
that she can't come back, Jerry?

31:21.980 --> 31:24.244
-How was your lunch?
-Terrific. Thank you.

31:24.315 --> 31:27.341
-Yeah, what'd you have?
-I actually didn't have anything.

31:27.418 --> 31:28.646
Really?

31:29.187 --> 31:31.417
I wish I had your will power.

31:32.857 --> 31:35.587
Your source, Miss Armstrong, who is it?

31:41.599 --> 31:42.691
Hey.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.931
Well? How did it go?

31:46.004 --> 31:48.564
-Okay, I guess.
-Excuse me. Rachel Armstrong?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.232
-Yes.
-I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Jones.

31:50.308 --> 31:53.334
I have a summons for you
to appear in US District Court in two hours.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.811
-No, no, no.
-What happened to two weeks?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.040
Hey!

31:58.316 --> 31:59.340
I'm Avril Aaronson,

31:59.417 --> 32:00.475
-counsel to the Capital Sun Times.
-Oh, yeah,

32:00.551 --> 32:03.987
I read your amicus brief
on the Celeste matter last year.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.216
I think you could take credit for her release.
I really do.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.953
I understand all the theatrics up until now,
but this?

32:09.027 --> 32:11.359
This is too fast. This is outrageous,

32:11.429 --> 32:14.159
and we're getting into some pretty serious
Fifth Amendment issues here.

32:14.232 --> 32:20.068
Look, Avril, there's a traitor out there
revealing the names of ClA operatives.

32:20.138 --> 32:24.802
Now, I think we should get somebody
like that out tout de suite. Don't you?

32:24.876 --> 32:27.344
We're bringing in Albert Burnside.

32:28.479 --> 32:31.880
I'll have to go home
and get my autograph book, then.

32:35.353 --> 32:38.618
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
It's already in the Sun Times budget.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.884
Hi, Avril.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.587
Hey, there he is. Albert, thanks for coming.
This is Rachel Armstrong.

32:43.661 --> 32:44.787
-Glad to meet you.
-Hi, me, too.

32:44.862 --> 32:48.127
Hey, I'm Ray, Rachel's husband.
Why is this happening so fast?

32:48.199 --> 32:50.690
Avril said it'd be weeks
until I went before a judge.

32:50.768 --> 32:54.829
Well, Mr. Dubois wants to get this done
before the press catches up.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.670
It's okay.
The press can just complicate things.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.710
Let's concentrate on keeping you out of jail.

32:59.777 --> 33:00.937
Jail? What do you... When?

33:01.012 --> 33:02.570
You're gonna ask for a continuance?

33:02.647 --> 33:04.842
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.079
Look, I've been through this.
Judge Hall is a good egg.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.052
We exchange Christmas cards.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.419
He's certainly not gonna jail you today.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.855
-Jesus Christ.
-Ray, relax.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.826
I mean, if Albert's this calm,
then we can be, too. Right?

33:16.894 --> 33:18.987
We'll be out of here in five minutes.

33:19.063 --> 33:22.658
Then we'll get a cup of joe
and we'll strategize how we can protect you

33:22.734 --> 33:27.137
and the constitution and democracy itself
for generations to come.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.033
That's a Theory, right?

33:30.108 --> 33:31.370
-Yeah.
-It's classy.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.535
Thanks. Nice suit.

33:34.145 --> 33:38.741
It's not a suit. It's a Zegna.
Hand stitched, 15 mil mil 15.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.044
What's that you're wearing?

33:43.721 --> 33:45.211
I don't know.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.524
I'm putting you in touch with my tailor.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.357
You always know when you're in a Zegna.

33:51.629 --> 33:52.653
Court room three.

33:52.730 --> 33:57.167
Your Honor, this morning, Miss Armstrong
appeared before the grand jury.

33:57.668 --> 33:59.863
I furnished you with the transcripts.

33:59.937 --> 34:05.637
And as you know, she was asked to reveal
the name of the source who provided her,

34:05.710 --> 34:09.703
quite possibly illegally,
with secret information revealing the...

34:09.781 --> 34:12.079
Excuse me, Your Honor. If I may?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.242
Yes.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.677
-All right?
-It's perfectly okay with me.

34:15.753 --> 34:18.085
Your Honor, I just met my client.

34:18.156 --> 34:22.786
I ask you to continue this matter for, say,
a week, so we can get our bearings here.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.351
Let me get my bearings first.
Why don't we proceed for now?

34:25.429 --> 34:26.920
Well, here's how it is, Your Honor.

34:26.998 --> 34:31.435
Mr. Dubois will say that my client was asked
to name her source

34:31.502 --> 34:34.766
and that she won't do so,
and, thus, you should compel her.

34:34.839 --> 34:39.172
He'll say that the information
that my client received is highly classified

34:39.243 --> 34:43.703
and the GJ is entitled to know
the name of the source and to find it out.

34:44.014 --> 34:48.418
He'll also say that there's no
federal shield law protecting her

34:48.485 --> 34:50.579
and that there's
no First Amendment protection, either,

34:50.655 --> 34:54.523
because this is a matter of,
quote-unquote, national security.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.590
Is that about right, Mr. Dubois?

34:56.661 --> 34:58.219
In fact, that's it in a nutshell.

34:58.296 --> 35:02.892
We contend that the First Amendment
does protect Rachel Armstrong.

35:02.967 --> 35:06.698
I'm well aware of cases in this circuit
in which this contention is...

35:06.771 --> 35:09.604
Well, I am aware
of those cases in this circuit,

35:09.674 --> 35:14.304
and they do not authorize her
to refuse to respond to these questions.

35:14.378 --> 35:16.676
Why don't the three of you
come up here right now?

35:16.747 --> 35:19.011
Rachel, Rachel, come on. Come on up.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.087
Over here to where the bench is.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.519
Miss Armstrong, I want you to understand

35:27.592 --> 35:31.187
that if I should order you
to reveal your source,

35:31.896 --> 35:36.424
that if you don't do so,
I'm gonna hold you in contempt of court

35:36.968 --> 35:39.402
and that you will be jailed until you...

35:39.470 --> 35:41.097
Hold on, Your Honor.

35:41.172 --> 35:44.437
Can you rule, please,
on my request for a continuance?

35:44.509 --> 35:46.943
Right. I'm gonna deny that motion.

35:47.011 --> 35:48.672
I'm only asking for a few days, Judge.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.714
I understand.
There is a serious national security...

35:50.781 --> 35:53.249
There's no reason
not to grant a continuance.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.842
Let me run my courtroom.

35:57.822 --> 36:02.919
Now, Miss Armstrong, I direct you
to reveal the identity of your source.

36:03.728 --> 36:07.562
If you want a few days to consider it,
I'll give it to you.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.162
I can't do that.

36:10.234 --> 36:13.692
Mr. Burnside, if you want a few days
to advise her to obey my order.

36:13.771 --> 36:16.899
I can't advise my client
to betray a confidence.

36:17.642 --> 36:18.904
Okay, look, Your Honor,

36:18.976 --> 36:21.945
given the direct threat
to our national security,

36:22.013 --> 36:25.881
I ask that Miss Armstrong
now be held in contempt of court

36:25.950 --> 36:28.475
and that she be jailed immediately.

36:30.087 --> 36:35.218
Well, it seems to me that I have before me
somebody who is defying my order

36:35.660 --> 36:39.323
and who seems to believe
that she is above the law itself.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.166
I hold you in contempt of court,

36:42.233 --> 36:46.431
and I remand you to the custody
of the United States Marshal.

36:46.504 --> 36:48.062
-Help.
-Judge...

36:48.139 --> 36:50.937
Wait. No, no. Your Honor. Judge.
Wait... No, wait.

36:51.008 --> 36:52.873
-Ma'am.
-Your Honor!

36:52.944 --> 36:55.435
As soon as you're prepared to speak,
you will be released.

36:55.513 --> 36:57.071
Could I have a minute
with my client to confer?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.979
You may consult with her
in the detention center.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.951
Timmy needs to be picked up
from the Hobermans' at 5:30.

37:02.019 --> 37:03.748
-This proceeding is closed.
-Judge.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.585
Judge. Your Honor!

37:07.258 --> 37:10.193
A lot of people looking to get famous here.

37:10.861 --> 37:13.796
-So now what? What do we do now?
-I'll call you tomorrow. Don't worry about it.

37:13.864 --> 37:16.059
-What are you gonna do now?
-I'm gonna call you in the morning.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.760
All right? Okay?

37:18.369 --> 37:21.270
Well, at least you'll take him
off your Christmas card list. Right?

37:21.339 --> 37:22.533
That's right.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.266
-It's a scare tactic.
-You think?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.806
I'll deal with it.
I'll see you back at the paper.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.005
Okay, I'll head over there.

37:30.615 --> 37:34.676
Mr. Burnside, this is a real honor for me.

37:35.186 --> 37:38.349
I studied you, growing up.
My dad was also a lawyer.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.585
This is a big, big mistake, Patton.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.422
Well, there's nothing like
learning from our mistakes.

37:43.494 --> 37:48.124
Yeah, well, sometimes a mistake
is like wearing white after Labor Day,

37:48.199 --> 37:51.657
and sometimes,
a mistake is invading Russia in winter.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.394
Okay, there are two things I need to know.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.099
-First, the story itself.
-Rock solid.

38:30.174 --> 38:33.075
Rock solid. Well, are we talking talc
or are we talking granite?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.078
Albert, please.
We wouldn't have put it through

38:35.146 --> 38:37.512
-if it wasn't...
-Okay. Second,

38:37.882 --> 38:39.042
how many people know the...

38:39.116 --> 38:41.778
How many people at the paper know
the names of the sources?

38:41.852 --> 38:45.015
We know the corroborating source.
Well, Bonnie does, anyway,

38:45.089 --> 38:48.889
and one of Rachel's sources at the FBl
gave us a copy of Van Doren's report.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.086
And why don't you have
the name of the original source?

38:51.162 --> 38:54.256
Well, for one thing,
Rachel agreed to complete confidentiality,

38:54.332 --> 38:57.267
and because her story was confirmed,
it wasn't necessary to know.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.735
Well, the good news is,
you can't be compelled to testify

38:59.804 --> 39:01.965
on something you don't know.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.438
Bosca wallet.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.473
Prada sunglasses.

39:09.947 --> 39:12.438
-You can keep that.
-Thank you.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.143
Tape recorder...

39:15.152 --> 39:17.814
I'm gonna need to get your jewelry.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.557
The wedding ring.

39:27.231 --> 39:29.426
I'd like to hold on to those.

39:29.500 --> 39:33.061
It's diamond, baby doll.
You don't want that in there.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.703
Miss Armstrong, come up front, please.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.149
Take a stand in front of the machine, please.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.088
Would you give me your right palm, please?

39:54.425 --> 39:56.222
Take it off. Left, please.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.853
It feels like his only real target
is Rachel Armstrong

39:58.963 --> 40:02.626
for publishing the article,
which is not a crime. In fact...

40:02.700 --> 40:06.602
Okay, if we've got Armstrong in jail,
that's our biggest ace in the hole.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.833
Two. The Van Dorens
and everyone at the ClA

40:09.907 --> 40:13.638
who worked with her
have agreed to submit to polygraphs.

40:13.711 --> 40:17.738
Jeez, could we turn this guy off?
I can't listen to this anymore.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.715
Better.

40:19.784 --> 40:24.050
You know, that's the only thing
that Armstrong's got going for her

40:24.121 --> 40:28.319
is the media, getting them to turn her
into some sort of a cause celeb.

40:28.959 --> 40:31.086
We can't allow that to affect us.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.325
Well, under the Branzburg case,
they've got no chance on appeal.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.466
Even if they point out
that you didn't exhaust

40:36.534 --> 40:38.764
any other possible sources
before going to her.

40:38.836 --> 40:41.396
Yeah. No,
the Miller case made that perfectly clear.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.269
-Sit still for the camera.
-But our objective,

40:44.341 --> 40:48.778
our goal, is not to...
Is not to keep her locked up.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.370
I want to let her go.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.383
That means we have got our source
and we can prosecute him,

40:53.451 --> 40:56.079
and, frankly, that's all I care about.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.684
Sit as still as you can,
looking straight ahead.

40:58.756 --> 41:01.054
Answer with the word "yes"
or the word "no."

41:01.125 --> 41:03.616
Is your name Erica Van Doren?

41:04.028 --> 41:05.120
Yes.

41:06.263 --> 41:08.993
-Were you born in Ossining, New York?
-Yes.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.966
Have you ever lied
on any official document?

41:16.040 --> 41:17.098
No.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.671
Did you reveal to Ms. Armstrong
you were an employee of the ClA?

41:25.282 --> 41:26.806
You gotta know a few rules.

41:26.884 --> 41:30.081
First, ain't no smoking
anywhere in the building.

41:30.454 --> 41:32.251
Cigarettes are contraband.

41:32.323 --> 41:37.260
No drugs, no fighting.
Fighting just buys you time in deseg.

41:37.962 --> 41:40.362
-What's that?
-Desegregation.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.459
In the movies, they call it the hole.

41:43.534 --> 41:48.164
I'm taking you to the spillover room.
We house the more violent girls in cells.

41:48.472 --> 41:50.133
What are you, a doorman? Get out of here.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.869
-Come on. Let me out.
-Get out of here. Get out.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.618
And ain't no fucking.

42:03.787 --> 42:08.087
No kind of sex at all.
No eating pussy, no kissing, nothing.

42:08.592 --> 42:13.222
If you're here for more than eight months,
you can apply for a kite or a conjugal.

42:13.297 --> 42:14.525
Here you go.

42:14.598 --> 42:18.398
But the turnover here is normally two weeks.
You won't even be here in eight months.

42:18.469 --> 42:19.561
Hey!

42:20.504 --> 42:21.596
Hey!

42:22.373 --> 42:24.204
-What's your name?
-Olivia.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.209
-Olivia what?
-Olivia James.

42:26.277 --> 42:29.804
-Well, Olivia James, this is Rachel...
-Armstrong.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.508
Rachel Armstrong, your new bunkie.
Be nice.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.676
And show her how to make the bed.

42:34.752 --> 42:35.741
There you go.

42:35.819 --> 42:38.788
Lights out in an hour.
Lights up at 6:00 in the morning. All right?

42:38.856 --> 42:41.051
Okay. Excuse me.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.685
Is there any way
of seeing a newspaper in the morning?

42:43.761 --> 42:48.721
No. But if you wanna watch the news,
you have to convince all of them to do it.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.832
-On his birthday, who was driving...
-He ain't no fool.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.207
-I don't care.
-Ain't no tomming in the yard, you know.

43:03.347 --> 43:04.974
That's just sad.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.400
Are you one of those
trained prevaricators, Erica?

43:25.469 --> 43:29.200
You know, they teach you that at Langley?
Box beater.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.371
Kicked ass, didn't l?

43:35.245 --> 43:38.180
Who do you think spoke to her?
To Armstrong?

43:38.882 --> 43:42.682
God damn it. I don't know!

43:44.521 --> 43:45.886
But when you figure it out,

43:45.956 --> 43:49.050
just give me five minutes
with the prick, okay?

43:49.259 --> 43:53.923
Well, it's been my experience
that Miss Armstrong will tell us.

43:53.998 --> 43:57.126
Right. She's never had her Vassar ass in jail.
She'll break.

43:57.201 --> 44:01.365
I don't know. I met her.
I looked her in the eye.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.872
She's a water-walker.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.226
I wish we had the cookies, though.

44:26.196 --> 44:28.460
Those were pretty good.

44:28.732 --> 44:30.324
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey.

44:30.401 --> 44:31.800
Guess who's here?

44:31.869 --> 44:34.235
Little man wanted to say hey,
make sure you're okay.

44:34.304 --> 44:35.669
All right. Here he is.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.263
Say hi.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.935
-Hey, baby. Hi.
-Hi.

44:41.612 --> 44:44.809
Hey. Why don't you tell Mommy
what we brought her?

44:44.882 --> 44:46.577
-Mom.
-Yeah.

44:46.650 --> 44:49.744
We brought you some cookies,
but they took them away.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.754
No way.

44:51.822 --> 44:55.383
Well, maybe they'll let me have them later
for dessert.

44:56.894 --> 44:59.863
-Dad made them.
-Dad made them? Yucky.

45:01.965 --> 45:03.159
Hey,

45:03.767 --> 45:06.031
I'm gonna be okay, sweetie.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.431
Hey, how was your spelling test?

45:10.507 --> 45:11.974
It was okay, I guess.

45:12.042 --> 45:13.373
I bet you aced it.

45:13.444 --> 45:16.607
Practiced really hard, didn't you?
Didn't you?

45:17.614 --> 45:19.411
-Yeah.
-You sure did.

45:20.851 --> 45:23.285
Hand the phone to your dad, okay?

45:24.388 --> 45:25.787
-Hey.
-Hey.

45:27.224 --> 45:29.124
Hey. How are you?

45:29.193 --> 45:31.058
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

45:32.162 --> 45:34.494
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't bring him anymore, Ray.

45:34.565 --> 45:37.125
-This is not a good place for him.
-What are you talking about?

45:37.201 --> 45:38.634
He's freaking out.

45:38.702 --> 45:43.196
He wanted to see you. What do you mean?
He wanted to make sure you were okay.

45:43.273 --> 45:46.265
Well, of course he wanted to see me. But...

45:46.343 --> 45:48.777
-I mean, I'm really serious about this, Ray.
-Okay.

45:48.846 --> 45:49.870
I'm not gonna be here forever.

45:49.947 --> 45:53.348
-It's a couple of days. It's a few days.
-Okay. Okay.

45:55.152 --> 45:56.414
So what is going on in the news?

45:56.487 --> 45:58.819
-I haven't heard a thing.
-You haven't?

45:58.889 --> 46:00.550
No, there's no newspapers in here.

46:00.624 --> 46:02.956
The TV is perpetually
tuned into Jerry Springer.

46:03.026 --> 46:06.621
Well, your jailing, your stance,

46:07.197 --> 46:08.960
it's in every newspaper, on every channel.

46:09.032 --> 46:12.229
No, no, no. I mean with the President.
What have they said about the article?

46:12.302 --> 46:14.998
No, same thing. Same as always.

46:15.072 --> 46:18.508
"The White House refuses
to comment on intelligence matters. "

46:18.575 --> 46:20.304
What else are they going to say? Right?

46:20.377 --> 46:25.246
I mean, the President, he's not making
any press conferences, that's for sure.

46:27.684 --> 46:30.209
Hey, listen, I was thinking...

46:31.054 --> 46:35.286
I mean, if this gets crazy, crazier,

46:37.127 --> 46:39.618
maybe you should tell me who it is.

46:39.696 --> 46:41.664
And that way, I can maybe talk to the guy.

46:41.732 --> 46:44.633
I don't know,
like on a human level, you know?

46:44.701 --> 46:46.134
-Ray.
-What?

46:46.203 --> 46:48.933
I've never asked you, not once.

46:50.174 --> 46:53.075
But this is... This is getting crazy.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.772
Okay, let's not go there. At all.

46:57.581 --> 46:59.845
-You don't trust me?
-That's not the point.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.680
You don't trust me?

47:02.619 --> 47:05.179
-ls it... What is...
-I guess that's it. It's over.

47:09.660 --> 47:12.527
Okay. I miss you.

47:12.996 --> 47:16.090
I miss you, too.
Can you pass the phone back to...

47:16.166 --> 47:18.191
-Hey, can you hear me?
-Yeah.

47:18.268 --> 47:21.032
Okay. I need you to make your bed
in the morning. All right?

47:21.104 --> 47:24.540
I need at least one responsible male
in the house.

47:24.608 --> 47:28.100
-Okay? Don't tell Daddy I said that, okay?
-I'll...

47:35.552 --> 47:39.545
She can't hear you, buddy. Okay?
She'll come home soon. Come on.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.807
All rise. Hear ye, hear ye.

47:57.908 --> 47:59.637
-Armstrong. Let's go.
-All persons having business

47:59.710 --> 48:03.009
with the United States District Court
in the District of Columbia will draw near.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.605
Give your attention and you shall be heard.

48:14.291 --> 48:18.990
Mr. Burnside, your client is here now,
so you may proceed when you're ready.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.620
Thank you, sir.

48:21.064 --> 48:24.898
Your Honor, I would ask
that you would release Ms. Armstrong

48:24.968 --> 48:27.562
until such time as
the U.S. Court of Appeals can rule

48:27.638 --> 48:29.868
on the validity of this contempt citation.

48:29.940 --> 48:31.407
Now that would vitiate the whole purpose

48:31.475 --> 48:34.239
of her incarceration in the first place.

48:34.611 --> 48:36.101
She has the key to her own cell.

48:36.179 --> 48:40.513
A key that comes in the form
of a loss of integrity is no key at all.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.313
Integrity is subjective.

48:42.386 --> 48:45.514
Miss Armstrong, I'm sympathetic,
but you've gotta help me out.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.023
Will you represent to me that if you're home

48:48.091 --> 48:52.391
that you'll pick up the phone
and call or contact your source

48:52.462 --> 48:56.091
and try to get permission
for you to release the source's name

48:56.166 --> 48:58.566
so we can put an end to all of this?

48:58.635 --> 49:01.502
I would be dishonest
if I said I could do that.

49:01.571 --> 49:03.903
Well, then, you're really not
giving me any basis at all.

49:03.974 --> 49:05.134
The motion is denied.

49:05.208 --> 49:08.939
Sir, I would ask that the court now

49:09.012 --> 49:13.381
impose a fine of $10,000 a day
against the Sun Times

49:13.583 --> 49:16.848
until such time
as Miss Armstrong's source be revealed.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.182
Your Honor,

49:18.255 --> 49:20.280
with all due respect to you,
this court and Miss Armstrong,

49:20.357 --> 49:21.949
we don't know who her source is.

49:22.025 --> 49:23.652
I don't see
how we could be held accountable.

49:23.727 --> 49:27.128
Sir, obviously,
with the representation on display here,

49:27.197 --> 49:30.291
obviously, the paper not only supports,

49:30.367 --> 49:33.336
but is encouraging
Miss Armstrong's position.

49:33.837 --> 49:35.771
They're enabling her.

49:35.839 --> 49:39.036
The Sun Times should be obliged
to obey Your Honor,

49:39.109 --> 49:41.373
and dismiss Miss Armstrong if she does not.

49:41.445 --> 49:43.242
That is out of line!

49:43.547 --> 49:47.108
Your Honor, respectfully,
I ask you to deny this motion.

50:04.668 --> 50:08.229
Don't even think of buckling.
Don't even think it.

50:09.272 --> 50:10.830
You pay the fine,

50:10.907 --> 50:15.071
and you let Rachel hold strong,
exactly the way she's been doing.

50:18.448 --> 50:20.609
You didn't need to say that.

50:37.134 --> 50:39.034
Such a beautiful day.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.229
-I like coming here.
-Yeah.

50:41.304 --> 50:44.330
-lt reminds me why we do what we do.
-I agree.

50:44.408 --> 50:46.467
You know,
my daddy is buried right over there.

50:46.543 --> 50:49.034
I feel it best that we not meet at Langley

50:49.112 --> 50:50.943
-for the time being.
-Yeah. Okay.

50:51.014 --> 50:53.209
Yeah. You know,
I'm just glad that you asked to see me.

50:53.283 --> 50:56.275
I've been wanting to speak to you
since this all broke.

50:56.353 --> 50:58.878
You know, I was hoping I'd convince you

50:58.955 --> 51:01.480
to give me a crack at the CBD
in the Balkans.

51:02.759 --> 51:05.819
-There's other business to attend to first.
-Okay.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.887
Erica, we've investigated
to the fullest degree

51:07.964 --> 51:09.761
all of those people
who were aware of your cover.

51:09.833 --> 51:12.996
We've looked at phone records,
emails, the works.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.697
-We're dead ending here.
-Really?

51:14.771 --> 51:17.467
So far, the reporter is in jail and not talking.

51:17.541 --> 51:20.999
It's essential we find out
where this leak came from.

51:21.211 --> 51:24.738
I know. I understand. You know,
and I couldn't agree with you more.

51:24.815 --> 51:28.683
You know, we don't know if this person
had it in for you or had it in for the agency,

51:28.752 --> 51:30.276
so can I just pick your brain a little bit?

51:30.353 --> 51:32.480
Yeah, of course. Please.
I completely understand.

51:32.556 --> 51:36.117
-Ask me whatever you want.
-When did you first meet Rachel Armstrong?

51:36.193 --> 51:38.855
Knowingly?
When she came to me at the soccer game,

51:38.929 --> 51:40.556
when she confronted me.

51:40.630 --> 51:44.327
And you're both volunteers at
Potomac Shores Elementary School, right?

51:44.401 --> 51:49.896
I am. Well, no, I'm not.
I was, but I'm not now,

51:49.973 --> 51:51.634
but she was a room mother there, she said.

51:51.708 --> 51:53.835
You never met
at school functions before that?

51:53.910 --> 51:56.470
-No.
-Your volunteer work never overlapped?

51:56.546 --> 51:59.276
You guys never perhaps
talked mom to mom?

51:59.349 --> 52:00.680
No. No.

52:00.750 --> 52:05.517
Ever go to a school event
where alcohol was being served?

52:05.589 --> 52:07.250
What? What?

52:08.225 --> 52:09.920
You know, when my wife
went to those functions,

52:09.993 --> 52:12.962
those let-your-hair-down things,

52:13.029 --> 52:17.466
my God, I can't tell you the things she said
that she now wishes she could take back.

52:17.534 --> 52:19.161
Sir, wait.

52:21.238 --> 52:23.570
Are you still investigating me?

52:24.241 --> 52:26.038
-Well...
-I just passed a polygraph.

52:26.109 --> 52:28.509
Well, given your training,
I'm not sure how valuable that is.

52:28.578 --> 52:32.844
It is a clinical investigation.
You don't need to take it personally.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.446
I don't need to take it personally?

52:35.519 --> 52:38.784
"We think that you're either incompetent,
a drunk, or a liar,

52:38.855 --> 52:41.688
"but you don't need to take it personally."

52:43.093 --> 52:45.118
How dare you?

52:46.096 --> 52:47.290
-How fucking dare you?
-Okay,

52:47.364 --> 52:50.197
-you need to watch your tone here, Erica.
-Let me ask you a question, sir.

52:50.267 --> 52:53.703
What, in my absolutely unblemished record,
can you point to and say,

52:53.770 --> 52:56.568
"Yeah, yeah, that's somebody
we can't trust"?

52:56.640 --> 53:00.736
-What?
-Point is, I don't even know you.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.240
You've been a NOC for so many years,

53:03.313 --> 53:05.213
there are very few people
who actually know you.

53:05.282 --> 53:07.807
Okay, well, you know what?
I know you. I know you, sir.

53:07.884 --> 53:11.615
I know your type. I see where this is going.
I smell it.

53:11.721 --> 53:13.382
You know, if somebody
in the ClA messed up,

53:13.456 --> 53:15.083
somebody messed up, gave me up

53:15.158 --> 53:18.491
and now you guys are walking around
investigating it like the Keystone Kops.

53:18.562 --> 53:21.531
You're just aching for it to be me. I see it.

53:21.598 --> 53:24.897
This way you can tell the press,
"You know what? It's not a rogue agent.

53:24.968 --> 53:28.096
"lt is just some silly little girl
whose feelings got hurt

53:28.171 --> 53:30.071
"that her investigative
conclusions were ignored

53:30.140 --> 53:31.630
"by the President of the United States."

53:31.708 --> 53:33.903
Findings that absolved Venezuela

53:33.977 --> 53:36.969
from having anything at all to do
with the assassination attempt on him.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.447
-Now you're being dramatic, Erica.
-Fine, okay.

53:39.516 --> 53:42.644
You know what?
You can speak to my attorney from now on.

53:42.719 --> 53:44.380
You can drop my protective detail.

53:44.454 --> 53:47.150
You can stop cutting me checks. Okay?
I quit.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.691
You don't just quit, Erica.

53:48.758 --> 53:52.694
Really? What is this, The Sopranos?
I can't leave the family? I'm stuck?

53:52.762 --> 53:56.061
Well, it's a process.
You're full of privileged information.

53:56.132 --> 53:59.431
You don't trust me? Fine, okay.

53:59.769 --> 54:02.533
I'm gonna give you reason not to. Okay?

54:02.973 --> 54:05.339
My husband's not the only one
in the family who can write.

54:05.408 --> 54:08.502
Look, you sure you want to get
in a war with the government, Erica?

54:08.578 --> 54:10.136
Do you need the messiness?

54:10.213 --> 54:11.703
You're in the middle
of a custody battle, right?

54:11.781 --> 54:15.774
You sure you want to drag Allison
into the middle of all this?

54:16.786 --> 54:18.981
You are so lucky you are a woman.

54:19.055 --> 54:20.352
Why is that?

54:20.423 --> 54:22.482
Because I don't hit girls.

54:22.959 --> 54:27.396
You know, you weren't the only agent
investigating the Venezuelans,

54:28.098 --> 54:29.929
but you were the only one that concluded

54:30.000 --> 54:33.492
that they were not involved
in the attack on the President.

54:33.570 --> 54:36.698
Yours is not the only report
the President read.

54:38.541 --> 54:43.137
I wish you the very best of luck
with your daughter and the custody battle.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.846
I hope you get to see her again.

54:49.719 --> 54:51.084
Thank you.

55:16.112 --> 55:18.046
Yeah, watch this.

55:24.421 --> 55:28.653
If there was enough money in the world,
I'd be buying my way out of this.

55:28.725 --> 55:31.319
Honey, if there was enough money
in the world, I wouldn't be in here

55:31.394 --> 55:33.726
-in the first place.
-You got that right.

55:39.235 --> 55:40.463
What's that?

55:40.537 --> 55:42.402
A Christmas present from my son.

55:42.472 --> 55:44.702
-How old is he?
-Seven.

55:44.774 --> 55:48.972
Shit, ain't nobody in the whole world
seven years old no more.

55:49.045 --> 55:50.239
I'm moving in.

55:50.313 --> 55:53.043
That fat piece of shit over there
keeps farting all night.

55:53.116 --> 55:56.882
About to turn my carjacking beef
into a homicide if I stay over there.

55:56.953 --> 55:59.421
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

56:02.726 --> 56:07.663
Congratulations, everyone.
We have three Pulitzer finalists in our midst.

56:10.767 --> 56:12.291
For investigative reporting.

56:22.245 --> 56:23.769
Yo, Armstrong.

56:24.748 --> 56:27.740
A message for you
from somebody named Bunny.

56:27.817 --> 56:31.150
I just took it for you.
We couldn't find you upstairs.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.014
"Armstrong - you are for the
Pulitzer Prize nominated"

56:33.556 --> 56:35.490
So you won something, huh?

56:36.593 --> 56:38.652
I ain't never won nothing.

56:39.329 --> 56:40.557
-Thanks.
-Sure.

56:42.332 --> 56:43.822
How was school today?

56:43.900 --> 56:45.731
-Okay, I guess.
-Yeah?

56:46.903 --> 56:49.599
-What was the best part?
-I don't know.

56:50.440 --> 56:54.774
Hey, I won an award.
Though I almost did.

56:55.145 --> 56:57.978
A big one, for being a good reporter.

56:58.047 --> 57:01.676
-That's nice.
-And the first person I wanted to tell

57:01.751 --> 57:05.687
was you 'cause you're my most special guy.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.726
-You want to put your dad back on?
-Okay.

57:13.897 --> 57:15.194
Okay.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.361
Hey, he really misses you.

57:22.105 --> 57:26.098
-Really?
-So, the Pulitzer?

57:26.176 --> 57:29.339
Yeah. You told me, remember?

57:30.680 --> 57:32.341
That's not that...

57:35.285 --> 57:38.743
Everyone to your bunk! Shake down!

57:38.988 --> 57:41.354
Lock your hands behind your head.

57:41.424 --> 57:43.483
Come on, Armstrong, let's get to your bunk.

57:43.560 --> 57:46.188
Lock your hands behind your head.
Shake down!

57:46.262 --> 57:48.162
-Let's go!
-Let's go, ladies!

57:48.231 --> 57:50.028
I can find your head by your bunks.

57:50.099 --> 57:51.896
-Move!
-Let's go, ladies! Let's go!

57:51.968 --> 57:54.095
Get to your racks now!

57:57.207 --> 58:00.870
What is you doing, Miss Jones?
Get to your bunk, now!

58:03.880 --> 58:07.281
You know this is not allowed in here.
It's contraband.

58:07.350 --> 58:08.544
Sorry.

58:09.185 --> 58:12.154
You been taking these
from the lK for weeks.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.987
More contraband.

58:32.275 --> 58:34.675
Hey, that's personal stuff.

58:34.744 --> 58:37.804
Can I have that back? What the fuck is this?
You can't take that!

58:37.881 --> 58:39.849
-What did you say?
-She can't take that. It's mine!

58:39.916 --> 58:41.383
Get back to your bunk!

58:41.451 --> 58:44.978
You hold that noise, ma'am,
or I will take you to the hole!

58:45.054 --> 58:46.749
You understand me?

58:48.558 --> 58:50.992
Lock your hands behind your head.

58:54.564 --> 58:55.997
Deseg for you.

59:00.703 --> 59:01.829
Fuck.

59:23.393 --> 59:27.159
Well, it's amazing news about the Pulitzer.
Congratulations.

59:27.530 --> 59:29.498
Yeah. No, that's great. I just...

59:29.566 --> 59:33.502
I'm not surprised Tom Williams got it.
His story got the mayor to resign.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.868
The President is so popular,
nobody gave a damn about what I wrote.

59:35.939 --> 59:38.203
Well, we're all proud of you.

59:38.474 --> 59:40.305
No, I know. Thanks.

59:40.810 --> 59:42.334
I'm sorry.

59:42.412 --> 59:46.041
They took my journal, my notes,
for taking an apple out of the chow house.

59:46.115 --> 59:48.310
I can't write, and it's driving me nuts.

59:48.384 --> 59:51.012
They took my pen.
I can't even write to Timmy anymore.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.783
I was wondering if you could possibly

59:53.856 --> 59:56.051
write an editorial or something,
shame them a bit.

59:56.125 --> 59:58.685
Yeah, of course.
Tomorrow, tomorrow's paper.

59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.126
Thank you.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.258
So, look,

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.859
Molly Meyers wants to interview you.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.298
What? Why? I'm not anorexic.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:13.035
I'm not in rehab.
I'm not dating Justin Timberlake.

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:14.804
Human interest, I guess.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:18.210
Look, she's a journalist.
She has to be on your side, right?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.011
The top dogs are really pushing for it.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:24.347
It's like you said,
no one's writing about your case anymore.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.388
We're losing traction.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.788
The government isn't feeling
the public pressure.

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:31.224
And the fines
and the legal fees are growing.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.819
-I get it. Say hi to Avril...
-Don't think about that. No. No, no.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:38.162
We just need to get you out in front again,
and, for what it's worth,

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.368
Molly Meyers will get the eyeballs on you.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:43.737
So?

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.671
Okay. But it's gotta be live.

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:48.609
She's not gonna edit me
into a doddering idiot.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:52.045
-Absolutely.
-And I'm not fucking crying, either.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.207
All right.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.744
What are you wearing?
What is this, the new Cartier?

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.218
It's a wonderful watch.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:01.620
No, it's not a watch. It's jewelry.
Here, look at here.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:05.650
I'm suddenly nuts about this de Grisogono.
I love the numerals.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:08.196
-All different sizes. Isn't that nice?
-It's a beauty.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:11.028
-Ready, Molly.
-All right, have fun.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:18.034
Okay. They're telling me
it's gonna be substantive.

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.597
It's gonna be serious.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.803
-Really?
-Well, that's what they're telling me.

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:25.780
This will be your moment, not hers.
You'll be great.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.739
Here you go.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:31.082
-Rachel, hi. I'm Molly Meyers.
-Right, we met once.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.547
I interviewed with you
to be your research assistant.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.285
Oh, no kidding.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.384
We are not going to have time for this.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:42.363
If you have time for the ldentities Act. Great.
If not, so be it.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.297
-That's fine.
-One minute.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:48.497
All right.
Thank you so much for doing this, Rachel.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.296
-And congratulations on the Pulitzer.
-lt was just a finalist.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:56.368
-Well, bravo. We're all with you.
-Thank you, that's very nice.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.812
Of course, I can't say it on the air.
Objectivity and all that.

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.246
All right, ready?

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:04.184
-You know we're live?
-Todd is gonna toss it to you in three, two...

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.816
Thank you, Todd.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.221
Rachel Armstrong, thank you for joining us.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.459
Rachel, you have been here
for seven months.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.990
How are you feeling?

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.260
Well, physically I feel fine.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:22.730
I don't get the exercise that I need,
but I feel fine.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:29.000
You know, I look at you and I get this
sort of, "How do you do it?" sensation.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:34.209
Vassar girl, Columbia Journalism,
suburban soccer mom...

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.886
How Twilight Zone-ish is this for you?

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.945
I must say, when I wake up in the morning,

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.286
it does take me a few seconds
to realize where I am.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.919
I mean, I haven't grown accustomed to it.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:51.661
You're married to the novelist,
Ray Armstrong.

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.197
How is the marriage holding up?

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:57.637
-Well, obviously, it puts pressure...
-lt must be very hard.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.699
It is hard. But we're strong.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:05.976
You know, he's very supportive of me,
and we're best friends. That really helps.

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.581
And what about your son? Timothy.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:14.548
When was the last time you saw him?

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:18.227
It's been a long time.

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.090
How long?

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.329
He came to see me
when I was first brought here,

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.906
but I have asked
that he not visit me in this place.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.606
Well, that must be brutal.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:40.877
Most mothers, though, are going to have
a hard time understanding.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:43.043
I guess I would have, too,

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.513
but most mothers would have no idea
what they would do

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:49.285
unless they were in my position.

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:56.125
The truth is,
bringing Timmy here would be selfish.

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.592
You know, it would be for me.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:07.966
And I do wonder a lot if I can survive
another day not seeing him,

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:10.842
but I know Timmy,

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:16.650
and I saw the look in his eyes
when he was brought here,

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:22.047
and I know the damage that it would do

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:26.060
to see his mother in this place, caged up.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.562
So, you know, I can't do that to him.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.137
Rachel, let's get to the meat of it,
because I have to try.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:41.370
On your story, on uncovering the identity
of the ClA agent Erica Van Doren,

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.378
who was your source?

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:48.509
Well, Molly, let me ask you.
Why do you have to try?

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:51.815
Try to get a fellow journalist
to betray her integrity?

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.255
I know you know better than that.
I know you do.

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:58.384
Before the cameras rolled, you said
you were, quote-unquote, with me.

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:01.291
Look, I have empathy.
Like you, I would never give up a source.

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.525
But you know what?
Sometimes sources have motives.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.861
Right, okay.

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:08.131
If the information
they're giving is valuable and truthful,

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:12.664
Iike with Watergate or the Pentagon Papers,
then their motives really don't matter.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.269
Any real journalist would be prepared
to put up with the discomfort of jail

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:18.973
to protect their principle.

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.710
I know you say
you would protect your source,

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:25.185
as if you're saying,
"There but for the grace of God go l,"

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.216
and you're never gonna have to worry about

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:31.419
-the government coming after you.
-Why?

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.652
Because the government really doesn't care

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.890
how you found out
where Paris had dinner last night.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:41.769
That's my bunkie right there, y'all.
That's my bunkie!

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.982
Ray.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.996
Hey. Hey, Albert. Hey.

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:11.594
Hi, I'm Albert Burnside.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:14.135
-Hi, I'm Gretchen Monroy.
-Hi.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.796
-So, did you see the Molly Meyers thing?
-Yes. Yes.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:22.742
-Rachel was real terrific. It was great.
-Yeah, she was unbelievable.

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.942
-I'll catch up with you.
-Sure.

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:29.041
Nice to meet you.

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.280
-Look, Albert.
-It's none of my business.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.688
No, no, no. No, you don't.

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.725
There are things about us
that you just don't...

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:41.422
-When you say "us"?
-Rachel and me.

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.827
Look, Ray, if you can sleep at night,
you can sleep at night.

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:50.934
She made a choice.

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:55.667
-Choices have consequences.
-Yeah, if you think your wife

01:06:56.078 --> 01:07:00.606
felt like she had a choice in this,
then maybe you two shouldn't be together.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:06.712
Well, you can tell her or not.
That's entirely up to you.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.924
Keep up the good work.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:31.571
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.
Didn't mean to startle you.

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:35.242
-That's okay.
-I'm looking for the Stein residence.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.944
Stein residence?

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:43.925
You know, I don't know.
I don't think there is a Stein on the block.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.824
Harv and Sheila?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.920
Harv and Sheila...

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.730
Oh, God.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.292
Rachel?

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.960
Who do you have working the story?

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.502
Evans and Merkow.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.441
The shooter belonged
to a right wing fringe group.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:38.173
I guess he thought Erica had it in
for our beloved President.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:42.274
Name's Alan Murphy. He's nuts and stupid.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:45.946
Drove his own car to the murder site,
then crashed it half a mile away.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:51.455
Once she resigned from the ClA,
she lost her protective detail.

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:53.392
God, this is so crazy.

01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:59.295
Evans and Merkow will want to get
a statement from you of some kind.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:07.501
I know. I get it. It's okay.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.640
It's okay.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:15.840
-How's Allison doing?
-Who is Allison?

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:18.645
Erica's daughter.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.189
-Bonnie...
-lt is not your fault.

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:30.290
Am I doing the right thing?

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:37.466
What's the problem?
We still have 15 minutes.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.576
Judge wants to see her.
I've got a van waiting.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.561
The President now seems to feel
compelled to get involved personally.

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:05.892
He wants to get
to the bottom of this debacle.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:13.669
What happened is terrible,
and my heart goes out to her little girl,

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:17.542
-but it hasn't changed my position.
-Okay, that's not what I need.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:20.912
I have here copies of waivers

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:27.485
that have been signed
by all White House staff and senior ClA.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:31.520
It authorizes you, gives you permission

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:35.189
to reveal their names
if they were your source.

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:38.565
It's a blanket waiver.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.927
That should do it for you.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.498
Have a look. See if your source has signed.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.906
-These people were obviously coerced.
-These people here?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.343
These people have signed
of their own volition.

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:54.348
Yeah, if you don't sign these,
then we'll harass you,

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.147
we'll investigate you,
we'll make your life hell on earth.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:03.422
I'm not even going to look at them, Judge.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.799
-Anybody want some tea?
-Yes, please.

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:15.166
-No, thank you.
-It's from Greece.

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.938
What are we going to do with you?

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:29.781
This has gotten to the point now
where my wife is pissed off at me

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.211
and is telling me that I'm some sort of bully.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.323
Well, you're not gonna get
much sympathy from me there.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:41.352
Your Honor,
can I borrow your library for a second?

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.532
You think I should look at the waivers.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:02.714
A man can live a good life,
be honorable, give to charity,

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:08.079
but in the end, the number of people
who come to his funeral

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.819
is generally dependent on the weather.

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.160
What? I'm sorry. I'm not following.

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:22.534
The weather has changed, Rachel.
I'm sorry, but it has. That's the truth.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.271
In the old days,
this would have been a lot easier to fight.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.175
The public would have called you a hero.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:33.806
But I don't know,
somewhere along the line, the press...

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:37.784
The press stopped being the white knight,
and started being the dragon.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.480
That's the way people see it.

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:43.821
You want to know why no paper
in this country, including your own,

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.124
has continued covering your story?

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.924
Why don't you tell me?

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:54.367
Because your 48-hour news cycle
dried up months ago.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:58.365
I mean, look at you, Rachel.
You look like shit.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.671
-Your kid is growing up without you...
-Don't bring Timmy into this.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.975
-It's not fair. Okay. I'm a good mother.
-Fair? Fuck fair!

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.208
Look, you may not
want to bring your son into this,

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:09.546
-but I do. You want to know why?
-Why?

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:13.520
Because I'm defending Rachel Armstrong,
not a principle.

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:24.023
A man leaves his family to go to jail
to protect a principle,

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:26.932
and they name a holiday after him.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:30.028
A man leaves his children
to go fight in a war,

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.539
and they erect a monument to him.

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:36.203
A woman does the same thing,
and she's the monster.

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:39.612
If we back down,
what are we saying, Albert?

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:44.084
"Trust reporters as long as
they're not mothers, because they'll crack."

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.784
The truth is, if I had known that
writing this fucking story

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:52.759
would have separated me from Timmy,
then maybe I wouldn't have done it.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.921
But here we are. The story's been published,

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.434
and the path has been chosen,
and there's no way back,

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.959
and in the end, my son will be fine.

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:06.735
You know, Ray is a great father,
and Timmy's gonna be okay,

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:11.175
but that will not be the case with my source.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.842
My source will be publicly saddled
with the death of Erica Van Doren,

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.078
and that, I promise you,

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:19.245
will mean the destruction
of the person we're talking about,

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.812
and that, Albert, that is not fair.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.183
Why?

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:31.126
I mean, your source knew full well
the ramifications of speaking to you.

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:38.897
My source didn't know what they were doing

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.169
when I got the information.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:47.938
-Was he drunk? Was he talking in his sleep?
-Hey, take a fucking walk.

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.416
We're trying to swim
a fucking waterfall here, Albert.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.920
We have a responsibility to the shareholders
not to go bankrupt.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.889
If you're so worried about that,
then I'll go pro bono from here on in.

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.586
-How about that?
-Sold.

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.661
Come in.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:06.229
Okay. I just got off the phone.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:11.371
Stan Riggens has agreed
to speak to the grand jury.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.637
I guess signing that waiver spooked him.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.802
Stan?

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:21.207
-I owe that kid in my office 10 bucks.
-When is all this supposed to happen?

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:24.946
As soon as possible.
It'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.148
Once he confirms he was your source,
you're off the hook.

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:30.282
Pack your bags, Rachel.

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:36.889
You were chief of staff to the Vice President.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.559
I resigned 11 months ago.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:43.196
And were you
the source of information provided

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:47.264
on the October 6th edition
of the Capital Sun Times

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:51.904
in which the identity
of the covert ClA agent was revealed?

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.442
I was.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.452
Can you tell us all how that came about?

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:04.849
Well, I guess I was just so angry
at Erica Van Doren and her husband,

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.294
-my emotions got the better of me.
-I'm not interested in your motivations.

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:12.993
I want to know how
you came to reveal this information.

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:15.767
I was at a party.

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:16.861
...you guys, it's muddy right here.

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.702
I had been drinking.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.135
Stan.

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:29.549
Hello there, young-ish lady. How are you?

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:33.679
Can I get a beer, please? Good. Great.
Just here with my son.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:37.919
They're cute now, but they grow up.
You know?

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.051
So I've been reading.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.897
So I heard Glen invited you.
It's good to see you.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:47.163
Yeah, and you thought,
"Well, how can I pass up this opportunity?"

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:49.726
That is exactly what I thought.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:56.311
-Can I ask you a question?
-Anything.

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:57.640
Ambassador Van Doren.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.840
-What about him?
-His wife.

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.940
Is she a spook, Stan?

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.586
Come here.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.054
-Now, look, you did not hear this from me.
-Of course not.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.031
-Not from me.
-Absolutely not.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:22.332
But, everybody knows she's at the ClA.
Everybody.

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:24.736
But you can't use that.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:28.799
Hey, I won't say it came from you,
but we're not off the record.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.507
Screw it.

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:35.345
Everybody knows anyway.
Common knowledge.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:39.115
Do you know if she happened
to get out to Venezuela at all?

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.677
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:47.086
She came to you
and asked you if Ms. Van Doren was a spy?

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.098
She already knew.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.023
That's right.

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.365
They're not satisfied with Riggens.

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.632
He was just your corroborative source.

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:00.402
So was the FBl guy
who gave you her report.

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:04.904
They still want the original source,
which puts us back at square one.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:07.447
Well, how much longer can this go on?

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:12.180
It's seven months or so before
the grand jury is required to disband,

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.722
and then Dubois
can just order up a new one.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.121
I can't...

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.965
I'm gonna have to tell the Warden I did this.

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.870
Look,

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:44.444
if you're gonna be here
another seven months,

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:48.148
then you should know, in every way

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.394
how this will affect you.

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.023
Albert told me.

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:16.177
Well, do I get any details?

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.809
Details? Yeah.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.879
The details are you're in here,

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.584
and whatever it is keeping you in here

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:32.058
is more important to you
than what's on the outside.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:39.128
-Well, how long have you been seeing her?
-Just a few weeks.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.935
-Do you love her?
-I don't know.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.494
You don't know?

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.770
It's only been a few weeks.
You don't know her.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.572
-What do you do with Timmy?
-What?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.343
When you're fucking her,
what do you do with Timmy?

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:58.545
He's with a sitter when we go out.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.248
-Has he met her?
-No.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:04.815
-Do I know her?
-You don't know her. I told you that.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.158
-She lives in Maryland...
-Okay. You know what,

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:09.424
-I don't want to hear any more.
-Look...

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:13.433
Ray, I know this is impossible for all of us.

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:16.329
I get it. You're lonely. I'm lonely.

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.072
Look, all you have to do to keep me,

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:24.237
to keep my respect,
is just tell me it means nothing.

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:28.271
That you love me, and that...

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:45.130
I'd like to see Timmy now.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:49.798
Something you should know is
I speak only the best about you to him.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:54.035
All right, don't patronize me. Okay?
I need to see him, and he needs to see me.

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:57.906
-That's it.
-Okay. Okay.

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:59.810
I'll see what we can do.

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:02.349
They don't allow visitation
on weekends anymore,

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:05.944
and his school routine is pretty locked in.

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.554
So, now, on top of everything else,

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.021
you're gonna try and keep my son from me?

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.957
-No. No, it's not like that.
-lsn't like what, Ray?

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.460
It's not like you're cheating on your wife

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:15.359
-while she is fucking rotting in jail?
-Keep your voice down.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.022
-Rache.
-ls that what it's not like?

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.429
-Fuck you!
-Hey! Hey!

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.333
-Fuck off!
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.670
Go to hell!

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.208
It's okay.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.608
Really, this is how you want...

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:35.881
You know what? Thanks for the fuck, Ray!
That really hit the spot!

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:41.952
Right, 'cause you're the only one
who got fucked by all this. Right?

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.877
Hey.

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:06.004
What the fuck is your problem?

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:09.676
-You're in my bunk.
-Get a new fucking bunk.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.914
-Hey. That's my stuff! Stop it!
-Yeah. It's going down here!

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.050
-Hey!
-Get your skanky ass stuff out of my bunk!

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:21.492
-Go get a new bunk!
-Get your ass out of my fucking bunk.

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.588
This is not your bunk!

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:24.791
That ain't right.

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:28.461
You want the bunk? Your bunk?
You want that bunk? Huh?

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:29.901
You want that bunk?

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.941
You want your fucking bunk now, huh?

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.180
Yeah.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.523
Come on, leave her alone.

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:03.126
Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.408
Oh, God.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.009
What happened?

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.591
I got the shit kicked out of me, Albert.
That's what happened.

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:25.455
How? What? Over what?

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:29.858
-We both wanted the top bunk.
-What?

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:35.267
Well, you've always known
the important things to fight for.

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:43.308
Are the doctors saying
you're gonna be all right?

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.403
Yeah. Whatever that means.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:57.422
You know,
I'm the most senior prisoner in this jail.

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:01.727
I've had 32 different bunk mates
since I've been here.

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.531
I gotta say, that's a record.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.733
Is that a new tie?

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:17.238
No, I've had it a while. Domenico Vacca.

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:21.279
-I took you for a Kenneth Cole man.
-Kenneth Cole?

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:26.144
Well, I'm glad you retained
your sense of humor.

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:33.823
You look like a woman
who could use some good news.

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:37.124
It's great news.

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:44.103
They've agreed.
They're going to take your case.

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:46.741
It's gonna be an expedited hearing.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:55.850
The next case this morning
is in re Armstrong.

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.647
We'll hear first from Mr. Burnside.

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:04.687
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.527
In 1972 in Branzburg V. Hayes,

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:13.090
this court ruled
against the right of reporters

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.831
to withhold the names of their sources
before a grand jury,

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:21.464
and it gave the power to the government

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:24.374
to imprison those reporters who did.

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:27.742
It was a five-four decision. Close.

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:32.811
In his dissent in Branzburg,
Justice Stewart said,

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:35.583
"As the years pass,

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:39.218
"the power of government
becomes more and more pervasive."

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:43.556
"Those in power," he said,
"whatever their politics,

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.758
"want only to perpetuate it

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:50.163
"and the people are the victims."

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:54.799
Well, the years have passed,
and that power is pervasive.

01:26:56.444 --> 01:27:00.107
Ms. Armstrong could have buckled
to the demands of the government.

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.876
She could have abandoned
her promise of confidentiality.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:06.443
She could have simply
gone home to her family.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.451
But to do so

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:12.626
would mean that no source
would ever speak to her again,

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:16.494
and no source would ever speak
to her newspaper again,

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:20.796
and then tomorrow when we lock up
journalists from other newspapers,

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:25.200
we'll make those publications
irrelevant as well,

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:30.676
and thus we'll make the First Amendment
irrelevant.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.740
And then how will we know
if a president has covered up crimes?

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.879
Or if an army officer has condoned torture?

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:47.419
We, as a nation, will no longer be able
to hold those in power accountable

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.895
to those whom they have power over.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.327
And what then is the nature of government

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:59.032
when it has no fear of accountability?

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.776
We should shudder at the thought.

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.780
Imprisoning journalists?
That's for other countries.

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:13.946
That's for countries who fear their citizens,

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:19.054
not countries that cherish and protect them.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.857
Some time ago,

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:30.734
I began to feel the personal
human pressure on Rachel Armstrong,

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:38.912
and I told her that I was there
to represent her and not a principle.

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:50.047
And it was not until I met her
that I realized that with great people,

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:56.721
there's no difference
between principle and the person.

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.645
Come on. I got new digs for you.

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:21.313
-You know, they brought him out here...
-It's nothing.

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.686
He's not a real person here.

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:25.191
-Soccer isn't a real thing here.
-They don't respond to it the same way.

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:28.228
-Judge, good afternoon.
-It's just not.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:31.058
Good afternoon, thanks for coming over.

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.724
Mr. Burnside.

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:37.102
We're talking about soccer not law.
Just want you to know.

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:40.072
Look, the reason I asked
the two of you to come over here today

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:43.508
is that the Supremes
have decided your case.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.070
The ruling will be down on Monday,

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:50.617
but I've been told by a confidential source
what it is,

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:53.551
and I wanted to share it with you.

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:56.647
Five-four, opinion against you, Albert.

01:29:57.125 --> 01:30:00.891
Same as before.
National security, First Amendment,

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:03.928
the court went with national security.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:08.693
And I want to say to you, Patton,
congratulations. You did a great job.

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.738
The court once again

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:15.868
has made clear that in a case
where journalists are not cooperative,

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.911
they may have to be incarcerated.

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.742
Well, thank you, sir.

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.913
That having been said,

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.246
I've decided to let her go.

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:33.221
I'm sorry, sir. What?

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:37.162
I've gotta let her go.
I've been doing this a lot of years now,

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:42.066
and I am sure that this woman
is not going to reveal her source.

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:45.299
She's been locked up for almost a year.

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:48.035
She has been beaten
within an inch of her life.

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:52.443
-She is resolute.
-That's exactly right. Exactly right.

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:57.075
I can only keep her in jail if I think doing so
will get her to reveal her source.

01:30:57.151 --> 01:31:01.349
She's not going to talk.
I really have no choice but to let her go.

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.356
If I may. This is a...

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:07.087
This is a woman
who's been protecting a criminal.

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:11.461
-That makes her a criminal.
-Oh, come on. She's not a criminal,

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:13.589
and she won't be a criminal

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:17.934
unless she is duly charged
and duly convicted by a jury,

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.507
and that's not my call.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.038
When are you gonna sign the paperwork,
Your Honor?

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.600
I want to get her out of there right away.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:25.907
I'm gonna go to court Monday morning.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.744
I'm gonna announce that I'm freeing her.

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:31.778
And, Patton, you got a choice.
You can beat me to the punch.

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:34.151
Just dissolve the grand jury.

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.823
As I'm sure your attorney has informed you,

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:40.861
the grand jury has been disbanded.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:43.653
We're gonna have to
wait till midnight to let you go.

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.631
Midnight?

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.500
What? You're keeping the reporters
away from your losing cause?

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:52.372
Rachel, I know almost all of it.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:58.369
I am indicting two government officials
for talking to you.

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:01.779
I wish I knew who it was
that first tipped you off,

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.582
but I'm not gonna get greedy.

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.284
I'm losing custody of my kid.

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:15.192
You want the wedding ring?

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:17.257
Kind of a trophy.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.628
You know, vilify me if you want, Rachel,

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:28.005
but I had a job to do,
and I had every right to do what I did.

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:32.136
I think you're confusing your rights
with your power, Mr. Dubois.

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.058
It's okay.

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.658
We booked you a room at the Mayflower,

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:57.033
but you know you're welcome
to stay with me as long as you need.

01:32:57.104 --> 01:33:00.540
-Thank you. Thanks.
-Sure.

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.372
I spoke to Ray.

01:33:03.477 --> 01:33:05.536
He's gonna bring Timmy by
first thing in the morning.

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:08.480
Thought maybe
you would like to take him to school?

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:09.811
Yeah.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.021
-That's okay?
-Yeah.

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.754
That'd be amazing.

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:20.020
God, I'm gonna scare him to death, though.

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:28.064
And, well, you let me know
what you want to do in terms of work.

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:29.432
You can if you want to.

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:32.768
No one's going to pressure you
about writing about your experiences.

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.307
Oh, please.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.436
Rachel, look in the glove,

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:41.879
hand me the insurance and registration,
would you?

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.076
I was only going 30.

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.727
Ma'am, would you please
step outside of the car?

01:33:57.798 --> 01:34:00.266
-What's going on?
-We just need you to step out.

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:01.858
Not you, ma'am.

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.870
-Are you kidding me?
-Get out of the car, Rachel.

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.567
-What's the problem, sir?
-I can't believe this.

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:09.735
-What do you want?
-I'm gonna ask you to turn around, please.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:13.337
-What is it? What are you doing?
-Hey, hey! Go easy on her.

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.980
Rachel, I'm sorry that it's come to this.

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.813
-What is going on?
-Back in the car, ma'am.

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:19.214
Rachel, you're being charged with...

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:21.186
-What's going on here?
-They're arresting me, Bonnie.

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:23.018
You're being charged
with criminal contempt of court.

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.250
What does that mean?

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:28.853
Well, it means you have obstructed justice,
and you're going on trial.

01:34:28.929 --> 01:34:32.296
-Come on. Let's go.
-Hasn't she been through enough?

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:36.660
God damn it.

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.141
Oh, no. God.

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:46.677
Dubois! Dubois!

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:51.818
Rachel, you're looking
at a possible five-year sentence

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:54.514
for impeding a federal investigation,

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:56.816
but I don't wanna go to trial.

01:34:57.291 --> 01:35:00.260
So, I want to give you a chance
to plead this sentence down.

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:05.822
I want you to look in my eyes
and gauge my sincerity.

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.700
Use your reporter's instincts. Okay?
You're good with those.

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:14.472
-I'm gonna offer you two years.
-No. No.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:19.036
No, it's gonna be suspended sentence,
probation.

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.740
You have to respect
what she's been through.

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:25.217
Albert, two years is not
as good an offer as it could be,

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.844
but it's not as bad, either.

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:31.855
Because you're guilty, Miss Armstrong.
You're guilty as charged,

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:36.260
and if you want to waltz
into a courtroom in a martyr's cloak,

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:41.463
trust me, you're gonna see something
that you have not seen yet.

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:45.198
Because this polite,
country lawyer demeanor

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:48.799
is gonna give way
to a wave of self-righteous indignation

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:51.504
that you can't even begin to imagine.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.309
That jury is gonna hear
fire-breathing oratory

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:58.078
about a country
whose security has been compromised,

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:02.646
a husband widowed, and a little girl
who's gotta visit her mother's grave

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:05.920
because you wanted to chase
a Pulitzer Prize.

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:11.559
So, if you force me to take you to trial,

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.528
I'm gonna make sure
that you don't make it home

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.595
-for your son's high school graduation.
-Come on, that's enough.

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:22.665
So, what's it gonna be, Rachel?

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:31.176
If I agree to this, there is one thing I need.

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:35.582
Oh, my God. You have gotten so handsome.

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.749
You're a real little man.

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:41.020
I'll bet you got all the girls
chasing after you, huh?

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:42.858
No.

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.955
No? Well, you will.

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:47.091
I don't care. Whatever.

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:50.698
Hey, I kind of like your hair this way.

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:56.539
-Look, I know you're mad at me.
-No, I'm not.

01:36:57.244 --> 01:37:02.079
Well, I think you are,
and I haven't let you see me in a long time.

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:04.675
-I'd be mad at me, too.
-Well, I'm not. Okay?

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:05.844
Okay.

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:09.288
Look, kiddo,
it hasn't been easy for me, either.

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.789
If I'd known it was gonna go on this long,

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:12.018
I would have done things differently.

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:15.027
I would have let you see me
every single day.

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.759
I am so sorry.

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.964
Dad says you could have
got out of here many times.

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:26.006
Well, your dad is wrong.

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:32.768
-Look, kiddo...
-I'm not a kid anymore.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.577
Okay, you know what? You can pretend
not to love me all you want,

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:38.140
and I can pretend to believe it,

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.683
but I love you,

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:45.521
and I think about you
every minute of every day.

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:47.356
Okay?

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:49.828
Dad says you're going to prison.

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:54.059
-I am.
-lsn't that where you are now?

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:55.499
No. This is jail.

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.696
Jail is where you go
when they decide your punishment,

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.671
and then you go to prison.

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.601
And what's your punishment?

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:06.140
-Two years.
-That's a long time.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.411
Yeah. But if I'm well-behaved,
then I might get out earlier.

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:12.507
So...

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:14.818
Is it dangerous there?

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:19.684
You know what?
If you visit me, come check on me,

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.751
I'll be okay.

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:28.532
Okay. I'm kind of busy, but I'll try.

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:33.704
I think we should go now,
on account of traffic and all.

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:37.210
Hey, hey, how about a kiss? Just one.

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:03.761
Bye.

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:01.117
You're a tattletale!

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.762
-I am not!
-You just told on Nicky.

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.095
That's because he won't stop.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:09.260
-You're a tattletale.
-Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:11.463
-That's enough.
-But you're not supposed to tattle.

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:15.167
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up with bullies, either.

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.140
Come on. Come on.

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:22.409
Are you a writer or something?

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:25.941
Yeah, I'm a reporter.
I work for the Capital Sun Times.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.485
We get that newspaper.

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:29.579
Oh, yeah?
Well, tell all your friends to do the same.

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:33.888
-The lnternet is killing us.
-Mom, how long till we get there?

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:37.486
-About 18 hours, Timmy.
-No, Mom, really.

01:40:38.332 --> 01:40:40.527
I don't know. I don't know.

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.862
My daddy is a writer.

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:48.840
-He is? What does he write?
-He writes articles,

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:51.901
though my mom doesn't really like
what he writes about.

01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:55.345
-What's he write about?
-He writes about the President.

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.375
-What's your last name?
-Van Doren.

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:03.219
Why doesn't your mommy
like what he writes about?

01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:05.224
I heard her yelling at Daddy once.

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:08.693
'Cause he used her secret stuff,
she found out.

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:11.856
-What she found out?
-When she was in Venezula.

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:16.760
Why was your mom in Venezuela?
Was she on vacation?

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:19.567
No, she was working.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.734
-Working?
-For the government.

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:27.404
But don't tell anybody
it's me who told you. Okay?

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:31.716
You bet.
