01:23.958 --> 01:24.875
Yes, of course.

They've already told us no.

02:18.958 --> 02:21.791

The last time we were here,

we asked them to join the war,
but that's not what we need.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.208
We need them to dig tunnels
underneath the battlefield

02:45.291 --> 02:47.708

You remember Horsey.
She famously ruined Mary's wedding.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.791
They ate the whole cake. All of it!

04:37.375 --> 04:42.166
Anyway, she's here with some new,
interesting idea to interrupt our lives.

to Centaurworld. You know this.

at Mary's wedding. [chuckling]

It was a destination wedding!

Okay, cool. Uh, whatever.

05:27.958 --> 05:32.208
The Nowhere King has a massive army
that is going to destroy us all.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.291
We need your help to dig holes
under his army to…

05:35.375 --> 05:38.333
[panting] …to undermine his plans.

something is wrong!

Just, um, uh, details.
You… You know how it is. [gasps]

But don't go anywhere.
Just, uh… Oh, it's gonna be great.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.041
She got another horse?! [gasps]

08:08.125 --> 08:12.208
But there is no other Horse.
You're the only horse that matters.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.791
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Guess what her name is.
Her name's Becky Apples.

Ugh! Of course it is.
How could Rider do this?

08:19.375 --> 08:21.083

21:01.041 --> 21:04.416
[grunts, whimpering]

21:04.500 --> 21:07.041
Horse? Horse?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.083
Where are you?

21:08.166 --> 21:10.333
No goosing way!

21:10.416 --> 21:13.791
Wammawink,
the news is spreading like wildfire!

21:13.875 --> 21:15.958
You're throwing a hootenanny?

21:16.041 --> 21:20.791
Um…
<i>Hola. Me gusta mucho un jootenanidad.</i>

21:22.291 --> 21:25.875
Has anybody seen Horse?
I… I… I think she's upset with me.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.791
Girl, what did you do?

21:27.875 --> 21:28.916
Well, you know,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.583
she maybe really needed a win,
and, you know,

21:31.666 --> 21:33.708
I just had an idea that was better.
You know?

21:33.791 --> 21:37.375
Mine was totally better. So I just…
I went out there and put myself out there

21:37.458 --> 21:39.333
and I was totally better and so I just…

21:39.416 --> 21:43.125
I might've accidentally
stolen her thunder.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.333
Maybe? Kinda?

21:44.833 --> 21:47.625
Hi. You know,
I'd never say this to her face…

21:48.458 --> 21:50.375
You know what? Never mind.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.625
I'm gonna do it.

21:51.708 --> 21:54.083
I'm gonna say it to her face.

21:55.208 --> 21:58.250
Sounds like you pulled a real Jeffica!
[echoing]

21:58.916 --> 22:01.208
Jeffica? [slow motion]

22:02.416 --> 22:06.458
[screaming]

22:09.083 --> 22:10.250
I have to find her.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.458
Take off that disguise, Glendale.
Let's go.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.083
Psst.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.625
Is the coast clear? Where's the fuzz?

22:22.375 --> 22:24.208
-There she is! Get her!

22:30.166 --> 22:32.291
Well, well, well, Glendale,

22:32.375 --> 22:36.250
looks like you've hootened
your last nanny.

22:36.333 --> 22:40.333
Glendale, you are under arrest
for various crimes violating hole law.

22:40.416 --> 22:44.083
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of hole law.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.208
<i>¡Soy innocente! Me llamo West--</i>

22:48.250 --> 22:50.500
You said something about finding Horse?

22:52.166 --> 22:54.666
