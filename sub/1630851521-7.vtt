WEBVTT

00:09.487 --> 00:12.316
<i>a father-son team made </i>
a groundbreaking discovery.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.014
We're leaving
in 20 minutes.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.843
It's my day off.
Can't I just do this instead?

00:17.887 --> 00:19.671
What,
look at pictures and mope?

00:19.715 --> 00:22.326
Yes, because apparently
love and great sex

00:22.370 --> 00:24.546
are not enough
for the mother of my child.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.330
Have you tried
talking to Amelia?

00:26.374 --> 00:28.767
Oh, she's still crystal clear
that nothing has changed.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.943
And still very good
at compartmentalizing.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.771
<i>They found that </i>
when they put lenses

00:32.815 --> 00:34.773
<i> at the opposite ends of a tube,</i>

00:36.297 --> 00:37.602
Oh, wow.

00:37.646 --> 00:38.516
What?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.519
Jimmy's Crab Shack
is turning 50.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.478
Carolyn Martin just posted
a bunch of old photos.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.957
My feet hurt

00:45.001 --> 00:46.524
just thinking about
working there.

00:46.568 --> 00:47.873
Oh, no!

00:49.919 --> 00:51.399
There's one of us.

00:51.442 --> 00:54.228
<i>Their invention was the first </i>
compound microscope.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.534
Waiting tables is hard enough
without the added mortification

00:56.578 --> 00:58.841
of dressing
like a shellfish.

01:06.892 --> 01:07.850
Whoo!

01:07.893 --> 01:09.156
Hey.
I was still looking at that.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.636
It's my day off, too.
We're going out.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.637
Get the kids.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.465
<i>And as basic as it was,</i>

01:14.509 --> 01:15.988
<i>their invention </i>
was a game changer

01:16.032 --> 01:17.990
<i>for science and medicine.</i>

01:19.514 --> 01:20.906
What can
I get you?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.691
Can I get a double espresso
with oat milk, please?

01:22.734 --> 01:24.258
You got it.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.998
You forgot your wife's latte.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.828
What?

01:32.701 --> 01:33.745
I thought I was supposed
to pick you up

01:33.789 --> 01:34.920
from the airport
tomorrow.

01:34.964 --> 01:35.921
I caught
an earlier flight.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.358
I thought
I'd surprise you.

01:37.401 --> 01:38.837
What if <i>I</i> wanted
to surprise <i>you?</i>

01:38.881 --> 01:40.622
By coming to the airport
a day early?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.102
No, with, uh, uh...

01:42.145 --> 01:44.626
jewelry or, uh...
flowers or something

01:44.669 --> 01:45.844
to welcome you home.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.196
I guess we'll just have to
find another way.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.936
I guess so.

01:54.505 --> 01:57.160
Woman on P.A.: <i>Dr. Gladsen, </i>
Labor and Delivery.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.727
<i>Dr. Gladsen to </i>
Labor and Delivery.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.164
What?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.122
Nothing.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.079
I'm just trying
to figure out

02:03.123 --> 02:04.341
how I'm gonna
thank Hamilton

02:04.385 --> 02:06.213
for calling an emergency meeting
this morning.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.302
You don't even care
about my poor kids

02:08.345 --> 02:09.477
whose mother
didn't come home.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.304
Nope.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.696
I really,
really don't.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.046
Mm.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.700
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.006
Hey, Bailey.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.312
They moved our booth.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.183
Excuse me? <i>Our booth.</i>

02:20.227 --> 02:22.142
At the medical student
convention.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.927
<i>Yeah, you should </i>
park in lot...Okay.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.016
...three -- It's closer.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.887
- I'm so sorry, Bailey.
- <i>I know.</i>

02:28.931 --> 02:31.847
We're a top-10 ranked
residency program

02:31.890 --> 02:34.023
and they stuck us
way at --

02:34.066 --> 02:35.329
Wait.
Why are you sorry?

02:35.372 --> 02:36.982
That I'm still
in Minnesota --

02:37.026 --> 02:38.680
My trip got extended
another day and --

02:38.723 --> 02:40.551
No, no, no.

02:40.595 --> 02:41.639
Yeah. I texted you.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.250
No! You didn't.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.209
If you had, I would have
called you back immediately

02:46.253 --> 02:47.471
and said a bunch of words

02:47.515 --> 02:48.994
I can't say
when people are around.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.997
I did text you,
but I forgot to hit send.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.564
Okay.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.740
Uh, we need to recruit

02:55.784 --> 02:58.221
the best and brightest
medical students

02:58.265 --> 02:59.483
to apply to Grey-Sloan.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.182
<i> Who better to do that </i>
than the actual Grey?

03:02.225 --> 03:04.358
And I will make it up to you.
I promise.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.100
Something wrong?

03:08.144 --> 03:12.322
Our booth is located
in the armpit of the convention,

03:12.366 --> 03:15.456
and we lost our biggest
recruitment tool.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.631
Dr. Grey
isn't coming?

03:16.674 --> 03:17.719
No.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.286
If she doesn't
win the Nobel Prize

03:19.329 --> 03:21.244
for whatever the hell
she's doing out there,

03:21.288 --> 03:23.115
I might just fire her.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.294
Hey, a-and where on earth
is Dr. Ndugu?

03:32.690 --> 03:34.649
Well, that was better
than airport flowers.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.172
Yeah.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.174
Yeah, it was.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.654
I missed you...Mm.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.309
...so much.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.230
Mm.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.668
Well, Bailey.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.453
Wants to know why I'm not
at the med student convention.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.715
Ooh!

03:57.759 --> 03:59.151
She's not gonna
like that.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.805
No.
Mnh-mnh.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.503
But how much do we care?

04:18.170 --> 04:19.694
- Where's Hamilton?
- Late.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.000
Does anybody know why he called
this emergency meeting?

04:22.044 --> 04:23.524
Because someone
needs to tell me

04:23.567 --> 04:26.004
what I'm supposed
to do about this.

04:26.048 --> 04:29.660
- What happened?
- I sprained it when
I stumbled in my own bedroom

04:29.704 --> 04:32.010
because my foot froze
when I tried to take a step.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.623
The Parkinson's is
progressing faster than you are.

04:35.666 --> 04:38.800
David --The FDA approved a one-time
compassionate use surgery.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.063
I want that surgery
scheduled now.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.673
The surgery's approval
was contingent

04:42.717 --> 04:44.588
upon very specific
benchmarks.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.503
We have not proven
cell viability

04:46.547 --> 04:48.070
above 75% yet.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.812
And I need to know why.
I've spent a personal fortune.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.901
I've given you
every resource you've needed,

04:52.944 --> 04:55.164
despite obstacle
after obstacle.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.079
But what does it
actually take?

04:57.122 --> 04:58.646
Additional lab techs?

04:58.689 --> 05:00.561
More fancy toys?
Extra cells?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.476
I hired you
to get things done.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.738
I am.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.043
<i>We</i> are.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.697
This team is working
around the clock.

05:06.741 --> 05:10.179
Groundbreaking medicine
doesn't happen overnight.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.616
Well,
that sounds like an excuse.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.009
Everyone knows

05:14.052 --> 05:16.707
when Meredith Grey
wants something to happen,

05:16.751 --> 05:17.839
she finds a way.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.319
What are you suggesting?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.973
Make this surgery
happen ASAP

05:22.017 --> 05:23.453
or I'm pulling the plug.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.933
On the project?

05:24.976 --> 05:25.934
On <i>you.</i>

05:40.557 --> 05:41.819
Remember that guy
who used to come in

05:41.863 --> 05:43.430
15 minutes
before closing?

05:43.473 --> 05:46.128
And order the unlimited
Jimmy's chowder bowl?

05:46.171 --> 05:47.912
Yeah, he'd ask
for a million refills,

05:47.956 --> 05:49.044
extra cheesy bread,

05:49.087 --> 05:50.785
then he'd leave a dollar tip
in quarters.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.700
Program?
- Would you like a program?
- It was good for laundry.

05:52.743 --> 05:53.570
Program?

05:53.614 --> 05:55.137
Look, Luna.
Look at this.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.574
- This is a program! Yes!
- Here. Here's a program.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.489
We're gonna
see a play.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.883
That's where actors
dress up in costume

06:01.926 --> 06:03.537
- and perform a story.
- Program?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.801
Are you also gonna give her
a play-by-play of the play?

06:06.844 --> 06:08.629
Hey, I read that
talking to your baby

06:08.672 --> 06:10.065
is important
for brain development.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.545
Yeah, I read
that this park

06:11.588 --> 06:13.329
has a cart that sells pretzels
the size of your head,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.809
but I'm not seeing any.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.985
Okay, Luna.

06:17.028 --> 06:20.249
There's a stage
and Rapunzel's castle.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.468
And there's a sign

06:21.511 --> 06:23.905
that says,
"They lived happily ever after."

06:23.948 --> 06:25.733
I'm sad,

06:25.776 --> 06:27.082
and you brought me
to a place

06:27.125 --> 06:29.476
with families
and fairytales.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.086
And apparently
no cheesy bread.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.002
Link...
Fairytales
give kids false hope.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.177
It makes you think

06:35.220 --> 06:37.005
that everything's
always gonna be okay.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.136
In real life,

06:38.180 --> 06:40.487
families just...
fall apart.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.054
Oh, my God.
Will you just go get a snack?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.709
Yes.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.884
Excuse me.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.060
Is your husband gonna
use that program?

06:49.104 --> 06:50.714
Oh. Ew.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.324
No.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.763
What do you see?

06:55.806 --> 06:57.329
What do you guys see?
What do you see?

06:58.330 --> 07:00.028
Every time something
doesn't go his way,

07:00.071 --> 07:01.290
he throws a tantrum.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.334
He's Ellis.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.466
Your mom
or your daughter?

07:03.510 --> 07:04.293
Both.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.642
What kind of person

07:05.686 --> 07:07.339
keeps someone from their kids
an extra day

07:07.383 --> 07:09.298
just so he can berate them
in person?

07:09.341 --> 07:12.214
A man feeling helpless
while his life erodes.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.433
Hamilton aside,

07:13.476 --> 07:15.478
we are working on a cure
for Parkinson's.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.524
We -- And we're actually
at 79% viability

07:17.567 --> 07:19.047
of the dopamine cells
at injection.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.048
Since when?

07:20.091 --> 07:21.266
Last night.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.485
We believe
the cells' survival rate

07:22.529 --> 07:23.834
is related
to temperature.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.141
Dr. Grey,
meet Dr. Gavin Hawj,

07:26.184 --> 07:28.317
star research assistant
and tech genius.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.754
He built
the motorized injector.

07:30.798 --> 07:31.799
It's nice to meet you.

07:31.842 --> 07:32.843
It's an honor
to work with you.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
At least someone
thinks so.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.499
Maybe I'll just pull the plug
on myself.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.153
Mer,
go back to the hotel.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.155
Take a nap.
Get a massage.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.765
There's a cure for Parkinson's
on the line

07:41.809 --> 07:43.375
and your idea is
to go get a massage?

07:43.419 --> 07:44.899
Just give us the day
in the lab.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.640
If Kai and I can't
figure it out,

07:46.683 --> 07:47.902
do whatever you want.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.904
You can stay
even if I go.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.471
Well, I could,
but I wouldn't.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.518
Fine.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.519
End of day.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.613
Would she really walk?

08:03.657 --> 08:05.528
I'm hoping
we don't have to find out.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.967
How long will you be gone
this time, Mother?

08:10.011 --> 08:12.622
Not long,
my dear Rapunzel.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.886
Now pull up your hair
and await my return.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.540
And no more singing!

08:17.584 --> 08:19.411
There's no telling
who might be lurking...

08:19.455 --> 08:22.240
This is insane.
Rapunzel's foster mom...

08:22.284 --> 08:23.938
A witch....locks her in a tower

08:23.981 --> 08:25.417
and her only form
of human contact

08:25.461 --> 08:27.637
is a guy
who climbs her hair.

08:27.681 --> 08:28.769
I figured
you'd have bigger issues

08:28.812 --> 08:30.553
with the damsel-in-distress
aspect.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.163
How is this an appropriate
children's story?

08:32.207 --> 08:33.164
How do you not know
"Rapunzel"?

08:33.208 --> 08:34.514
Who would've
read it to me?

08:36.167 --> 08:37.604
That voice!

08:37.647 --> 08:39.736
Perhaps I can
climb up the tower

08:39.780 --> 08:41.956
the same way
that witch came down.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.523
- Tell me he has a rope ladder.
- Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!

08:43.566 --> 08:45.437
That would be smart,
but no.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.831
Eventually he goes blind
after a failed suicide attempt.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.533
Her hair is so luxurious
and strong.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.234
Jeremy?

09:00.844 --> 09:02.150
Oh, my God!

09:02.193 --> 09:03.325
Wow.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.545
That turned dark fast.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.547
I don't think that
was supposed to happen.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.591
Oh, my God.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.941
Is anyone here
a doctor?!

09:10.985 --> 09:12.595
Yes! I can help.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.212
Janice:
Thank you for your patience.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.779
Um, we invite you to stay

09:22.823 --> 09:24.607
for the Fairytale Theater's
production of "Cinderella,"

09:24.651 --> 09:27.305
which we hope
will begin soon.

09:28.829 --> 09:29.960
911's not picking up.

09:30.004 --> 09:30.961
Okay. Sir?

09:31.005 --> 09:32.484
Jeremy.
His name's Jeremy.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.747
Is he gonna be okay?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.879
His pulse is a little thready
and irregular.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.620
Jeremy, hi.
I'm Dr. Wilson.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.230
This is Dr. Lincoln
from Grey-Sloan.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.275
Can you say something?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.017
Oh, my God.
Please be okay. Please be okay.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.453
He's got an open
femoral fracture

09:44.496 --> 09:45.628
and no DP pulse.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.498
I'm gonna have to reduce
and splint this.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.499
Jo, can you...?

09:47.543 --> 09:48.631
Yeah.
Alright.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.198
Hey, Jeremy,
this is gonna hurt, okay?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.026
But the break
is cutting off the blood supply,

09:52.069 --> 09:53.201
so the sooner we straighten
it out, the better.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.898
We don't want
to lose your leg, okay?

09:54.942 --> 09:57.640
I'm right here.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- One...two...three.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.517
Okay. We lost his pulse.
Starting CPR.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.519
He's got
a heart condition!

10:07.563 --> 10:09.609
It's called --
I-I don't know, but --

10:09.652 --> 10:12.089
but he wears
an emergency bracelet.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.569
Congenitally corrected

10:13.613 --> 10:15.310
transposition
of the great arteries.

10:15.353 --> 10:18.052
Does that help or matter or --Yes, it does. Yes.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.488
Is 911 picking up?

10:19.531 --> 10:20.837
Still ringing.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.578
There's a thing
near the playground.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.884
The machine
that starts the shocking.

10:23.927 --> 10:24.885
- An AED!
- Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.408
Go get it!

10:29.367 --> 10:31.195
Thank you
for stopping by this morning.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.675
Grey-Sloan takes pride

10:32.719 --> 10:35.069
in our outstanding
education program,

10:35.112 --> 10:36.984
led by Dr. Richard Webber.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.638
I mean,
we're consistently ranked

10:38.681 --> 10:41.684
among the nation's
top-10 teaching hospitals.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.687
And as a Fox Foundation
hospital,

10:44.731 --> 10:47.037
we have greater access
to resources

10:47.081 --> 10:49.213
like cutting-edge technologies

10:49.257 --> 10:51.346
and extensive research mat--

10:51.389 --> 10:53.783
Why don't you
take a brochure

10:53.827 --> 10:55.219
and leave your e-mail?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.917
Mm.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.310
Chicago Lutheran's handing out
deep-dish pizzas.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.660
Ooh. Yes, please.

11:00.703 --> 11:01.704
Hey! Hey!

11:05.577 --> 11:08.145
Okay,
when did residency recruitment

11:08.189 --> 11:09.973
turn into
a bribery scheme?

11:10.017 --> 11:13.498
Look at Palley,
resorting to massages?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.152
That's a little desperate,
don't you think?

11:15.196 --> 11:16.632
Well,
they are highlighting

11:16.676 --> 11:18.590
their resident
wellness program.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.507
You think we should have brought
a dog-and-pony show?

11:22.551 --> 11:24.205
You were gonna bring
Meredith Grey.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.424
And Owen Hunt,

11:26.468 --> 11:27.817
but apparently,

11:27.861 --> 11:29.210
a trauma came in.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.212
And Ndugu's
a no-show.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.561
But that's not bribery.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.563
That's -- That's
excellence in education.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.782
There's a difference.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.653
What about
the Webber Method?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.873
That's not
an official program.

11:39.916 --> 11:43.311
Well, the CAPE Clinic
is raffling off a laptop.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.400
You got a better idea?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.189
Hey.
Hey.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.277
I got your text.
Yeah.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.583
- Do you need a consult?
- I do. Yeah.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.280
Um, how'd your meeting go?

11:56.324 --> 11:58.892
Well, a meeting would imply
a rational conversation.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.937
I've managed to disappoint
both of my bosses

12:00.981 --> 12:02.156
in the span of an hour.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.201
So I might just quit
and move to Italy.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.289
Right, right, right.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.465
Um, before you do,
take a look.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.989
Did my sister
put you up to this?

12:09.032 --> 12:10.207
To distract me
from Hamilton?

12:10.251 --> 12:11.774
Uh, well, I've never
met your sister.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.341
Plus,
if I distracted you

12:13.384 --> 12:14.516
every time
you were mad at David,

12:14.559 --> 12:16.126
I'd never get anything done.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.085
So, a 45-year-old male
with headache,

12:18.128 --> 12:20.174
palpitations,
and hypertension.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.915
Adrenal tumor,
looks like a pheo.
Yeah.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.438
So do you think
it's possible

12:23.481 --> 12:25.788
to do a partial
adrenalectomy?

12:25.832 --> 12:27.572
I mean,
you would have to.

12:27.616 --> 12:28.965
He's only got
one adrenal.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.185
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course.
- Do you know his history?

12:31.228 --> 12:32.664
Yeah, I do.
He's a kidney donor.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.188
The adrenal gland
was so badly adhered

12:34.231 --> 12:36.233
we had to take it
along with the kidney.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.408
Did you work
on the transplant?

12:37.452 --> 12:38.583
I was involved, yes.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.584
So, partial?

12:39.628 --> 12:41.021
Uh, sure.
Great.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.457
I've already secured you
privileges,

12:42.500 --> 12:44.676
and I'll have my favorite
resident scrub in with you.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.939
Me?
Yeah.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.679
There isn't anyone else
who can do this?

12:47.723 --> 12:49.377
There are.
There are several someones.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.292
But this guy needs the best.
He needs you.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.468
Where am I going?

12:53.511 --> 12:54.817
Fifth floor.
I'll take you up.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.210
Come on.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.433
This is amazing.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.957
We wrapped the syringe
in a thermal coating

13:04.000 --> 13:05.262
to insulate it.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.308
The key is keeping the cells
cold long enough.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.657
Is the injector speed
a factor?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.006
Mm,
that's what we're testing.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.138
But it's a careful balance

13:11.181 --> 13:12.574
between speed and temperature.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.836
Game time.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.011
Let's see if it worked.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.100
I'll prep
the next batch of cells.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.931
Okay. And this counts
the viable cells?

13:21.975 --> 13:22.889
Yes.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.847
Healthy cells
reject the dye.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.675
Dead cells
turn blue.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.460
Then the software converts them
to green and red

13:29.504 --> 13:32.028
so we can easily see
how many are still alive.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.074
This takes
so much patience.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.033
You prefer instant
gratification?

13:37.077 --> 13:39.601
Not instant, but...

13:39.644 --> 13:40.863
How long have you
been at this?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.038
Two years.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.128
With no guarantee
that it goes anywhere?

13:46.086 --> 13:47.130
That's why
I like tumors.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.393
They're there,
you cut, they're gone.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.221
Yay.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.745
I don't have the patience
for patients.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.443
You never wanted to be
a clinical doctor?

13:55.486 --> 13:57.619
My teachers encouraged it.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.273
My mom would've loved

13:59.316 --> 14:01.797
to have 24/7 access
to free medical advice.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.973
But being a clinician's

14:04.017 --> 14:06.280
not what attracted me
to science.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.630
It was always
about the discovery,

14:08.673 --> 14:10.850
the openness
to possibility.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.330
And an M.D. felt
confining to me.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.159
So I applied
to PhD programs instead.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.118
Seems like
it worked out.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.077
My mom might
argue with you.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.776
What about you?
Why neuro?

14:24.820 --> 14:26.735
No one ever
asks me that.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.693
They just assume
that it's...

14:28.737 --> 14:30.086
'cause I wanted to be
like my brother.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.522
Who's your brother?

14:33.350 --> 14:35.483
You just became

14:35.526 --> 14:36.919
my favorite person.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.099
Still 79%.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.842
Excuse me.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.830
Damn it.
He must've torn the SFA.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.616
- I'm gonna try to pack it.
- Okay.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.704
Let's see.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.491
Is this just all snacks?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.015
You're the one who's always
talking about food.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.494
- What do you need?
- Luna's cloth diapers.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.974
I stopped packing them.
What about Scout's?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.236
I stopped packing them.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.846
Paramedics
are on their way.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.066
Here's the AED.
How is he?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.807
- What can I do to help?
- Open the defibrillator.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.504
And put the pads
on his chest.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.944
<i>Place pad exactly </i>
as shown in the picture.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.469
It's okay, Luna. You're fine.
Mommy's right here.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.732
<i>Press firmly </i>
- to patient's bare skin.
- I'm just saving a life.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.733
Janice:
You want me to get her?

15:51.776 --> 15:52.864
Yes.
Can you push her closer to me?

15:52.908 --> 15:53.865
Thank you.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.650
Link:
He's still bleeding.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.305
Your belt.
I can use it as a tourniquet.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.654
Is he gonna
bleed to death?

15:59.697 --> 16:00.829
Not if I can help it.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.923
Not messaging she needs
but thank you.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.751
Okay.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.883
Brian Williams, 45,

16:11.927 --> 16:13.363
CT and biochemical work-up

16:13.407 --> 16:16.192
revealed a pheochromocytoma
on the right adrenal.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.673
BP's still elevated
despite Prazosin --

16:18.716 --> 16:20.109
180 over 98.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.806
Otherwise
vital signs stable.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.721
Thank you, Dr. Wright.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.071
Do you have pain
on the right side?

16:25.114 --> 16:26.986
A little.
Okay.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.162
Paige freaked out
when I had heart palpitations

16:29.205 --> 16:31.120
at Alex's
volleyball game.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.904
Figured it was stress
from the semi-finals.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.819
Or from having
three teenage girls.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.953
One's trying to get
a volleyball scholarship,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.042
one's in callback auditions
for the high school play,

16:40.086 --> 16:42.436
and the youngest
apparently just got dumped.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.003
I don't know how
you keep up.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.221
I don't.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.570
I ended up collapsing
in the third game.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.572
Well, this type of tumor
is extremely rare,

16:48.616 --> 16:50.139
so it's great
we caught it now.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.402
Thanks to this guy.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.752
So, I'll go in from the side
laparoscopically.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.189
It's the least invasive.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.408
Oh, so like
my donation surgery?

16:58.452 --> 17:00.280
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.455
You'll be in the room?

17:01.498 --> 17:03.152
Uh, I can be.
If Dr. Grey doesn't mind.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.588
Of course.
No problem.

17:04.632 --> 17:05.850
Yeah.

17:05.894 --> 17:09.985
I'll see you in the OR.
Okay. Dr. Wright?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.814
Okay.
So, tell me what we do next.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.609
Mnh.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.698
They're
my coping mechanism.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.049
Left over from my days
on the swim team.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.617
It's a problem.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.837
There are worse habits.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.058
Yeah, but these are like
a gateway to fries.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.280
If Grey walks,
would you really leave, too?

17:45.803 --> 17:46.935
She brought me
onto the project.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.590
And she's family.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.026
But we are gonna

17:51.070 --> 17:55.291
figure this out because
walking boosts creativity.

17:55.335 --> 17:56.988
I read that
in a study.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.692
Anything?

18:04.735 --> 18:05.910
Not yet.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.129
You?

18:07.173 --> 18:09.000
No. Too distracted
by the thought of fries.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.611
Mm.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.613
When you get stuck in surgery,
what do you do?

18:12.656 --> 18:14.180
You cut or close.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.311
When someone's brain
is open,

18:15.355 --> 18:17.313
that's pretty much
all you can do.

18:17.357 --> 18:20.490
We had to dissect worms
in 8th grade biology.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.971
Total disaster.
Worm guts everywhere.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.930
Cutting was
never my forte.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.323
I remember getting
my first pair of scissors.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.498
I was 4.
Mm.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.152
And unstoppable?

18:30.196 --> 18:31.588
I hated them.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.982
They were so dull they couldn't
cut through butter.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.027
So I stole
my older sister's.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.725
Then I was unstoppable.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.467
I cut the curtains,
my hair,

18:40.510 --> 18:42.164
her favorite dress,

18:42.208 --> 18:43.818
the tops of
her dolls' heads.

18:43.861 --> 18:47.082
That's disturbing.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.563
I wanted to see
where feelings came from.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.826
What'd you find?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.306
Cotton.
Oh.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.222
It was very disappointing.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.093
Ah.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.573
Time to go back.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.140
You have an idea?

19:01.183 --> 19:05.361
No, but I only allotted myself
15 minutes to stress out.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.842
And honestly,
I feel better.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.807
His s-sword! I can use
that to secure the tourniquet.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.723
Okay.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.464
His heart rate's
all over the place.

19:21.508 --> 19:22.987
His heart condition
makes him prone

19:23.031 --> 19:24.119
to abnormal heart rates.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.425
Could that
be why he fell?

19:25.468 --> 19:26.643
- Most likely.
- <i>Shock advised.</i>

19:26.687 --> 19:28.384
<i>Stay clear of patient.</i>

19:28.428 --> 19:29.733
<i>Press the flashing </i>
- shock button.
- He needs to be shocked.

19:29.777 --> 19:30.865
- Clear.
- Now?

19:30.908 --> 19:31.996
You want to argue
with the machine?

19:32.040 --> 19:34.173
Clear. <i>Deliver shock --</i>

19:34.216 --> 19:37.001
<i>Shock delivered. </i>
Analyzing.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.655
You need to move faster. <i>Shock advised.</i>

19:38.699 --> 19:40.135
- I'm almost done.
- The tourniquet's
not gonna matter

19:40.179 --> 19:41.005
if his heart
doesn't start.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.398
Clear.
Okay, I'm done.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.531
<i>Shock delivered. </i>
Analyzing.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.054
His heart's not starting.
We need epi.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.273
- <i>Begin CPR.
- Where's the ambulance?</i>

19:47.316 --> 19:48.709
They said 10 minutes
like 15 minutes ago.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.624
You have to save him.
Please save him.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.060
Alright.
- Where can we get some epi?
- Don't look at me.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.628
I packed bananas
and peanut butter pretzels.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.456
There's gotta be a kid here
with an allergy.
EpiPens!

19:56.499 --> 19:59.067
Okay, go into the audience.
- Collect as many as you can get.
- Alright.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.374
Hey. Does anyone here
have an EpiPen?

20:01.417 --> 20:03.027
If you do,
we need one now!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.464
Run!
Yeah,
as many as you can get.

20:04.507 --> 20:05.943
Woman:
I have one right here.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.779
- Is this really gonna work?
- It's worth a shot.

20:15.823 --> 20:16.867
- Just do it. Please.
- <i>30 seconds </i>
until analysis will resume.

20:16.911 --> 20:17.694
Pushing 0.3 of epi.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.957
Five...six...seven...

20:20.001 --> 20:21.698
Ah! This is gonna take longer
than the ambulance.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.178
Okay, Cathi.
Can you take over?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.137
One hand over the other,
2 inches deep, okay?

20:26.181 --> 20:29.010
<i>15 seconds </i>
- until analysis will resume.
- Ready?

20:35.103 --> 20:36.974
Can you do that?
He won't overdose?

20:37.018 --> 20:38.193
He would get more
in the hospital.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.195
<i>Shock not advised.</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:41.892
Okay.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.852
He's back.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.941
We did it.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.116
Finally.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.639
Okay, he's gonna need
to be stabilized.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.685
We'll take him to Grey-Sloan.
You okay if I ride with him?

20:51.728 --> 20:52.947
Yeah.
I'll meet you there.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.123
Okay. Alright.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.298
Hey!

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
Over here!

21:02.565 --> 21:03.610
Winston:
How's your dad?

21:03.653 --> 21:05.829
Mm.
He's better.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.483
He's doing way better.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.442
I honestly think
he was better awhile ago.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.444
He just didn't
want me to leave.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.272
You think
he was faking it?

21:13.315 --> 21:14.751
A little bit!

21:14.795 --> 21:17.101
A little bit I do.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
Mm.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.194
I liked being there with him,
though.

21:24.457 --> 21:27.111
Mm. I hated being
away from you.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.724
You are...

21:30.767 --> 21:32.247
my dream come true.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.728
You know that, right?

21:38.775 --> 21:41.561
I'm honestly not sure
I'm awake right now.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.911
I might need
some convincing.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.049
Do you need
to get that?

21:52.093 --> 21:53.224
Nope.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.704
It's cardio,

21:54.748 --> 21:57.359
but I'm supposed to be
at the med student convention.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.839
So let's let Altman
get this one.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.189
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.017
Mmm.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.890
Mmm.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.548
Using this teaching method,

22:12.592 --> 22:14.376
every resident gets
their own patient

22:14.420 --> 22:15.638
and their own OR.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.466
Of course...They seem
to be into it.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.816
Of course they are.
It's the future of teaching.

22:19.860 --> 22:23.559
I'm not sure why we're letting
this <i>particular</i> future sell it.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.127
Peer-to-peer communication
can be very effective.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.172
So, basically,
you're unsupervised?

22:28.216 --> 22:29.478
No.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.654
Attendings rotate

22:31.698 --> 22:35.832
through the carefully timed
overlapping procedures.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.617
They're there for all
the critical parts. See?

22:37.660 --> 22:39.793
I don't get it.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.969
It's ORs,

22:42.012 --> 22:43.144
residents,

22:43.187 --> 22:45.059
attendings.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.323
It would be
better in color.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.064
The Webber Method

22:50.107 --> 22:52.588
lets us finish residency
with a larger case log.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.894
And we get more autonomy,

22:53.937 --> 22:55.374
which helps us become
better surgeons.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.811
That's kind of what
everyone says.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.988
How do we know
Grey-Sloan's any better?

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
Oh!

23:02.642 --> 23:05.166
Our personalized tote bag's
ready at Newport Med.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.167
Thank you.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.475
Uh...

23:10.389 --> 23:12.347
Well...

23:12.391 --> 23:13.479
Put that down.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.133
Good job, guys.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.745
Dr. Wilson.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.268
Have you heard anything
about Jeremy?

23:20.311 --> 23:21.748
Uh, no, but Dr. Lincoln

23:21.791 --> 23:23.489
should be operating on him
right now.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.620
Can you check?

23:24.664 --> 23:25.708
The front desk
can't tell me anything

23:25.752 --> 23:27.493
because I'm not family,
but I am.

23:27.536 --> 23:28.624
I am his family.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.365
Yesterday we did
two shows in Boise,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.454
then packed up
and drove here overnight.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.195
It's not easy
sleeping on a bus,

23:34.238 --> 23:35.457
let alone one
where you're crammed

23:35.501 --> 23:37.633
between a plywood tower
and pile of wigs.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.548
But we do it.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.855
For six years now,
we do it together.

23:41.898 --> 23:44.684
Because we love it,
and we love...

23:44.727 --> 23:47.295
We, uh...

23:47.338 --> 23:49.210
He's my favorite --

23:49.253 --> 23:51.168
He's my best...

23:51.212 --> 23:53.693
His family is
in Philadelphia,

23:53.736 --> 23:55.825
and he hasn't seen them
for years.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.348
<i>I</i> am his family.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.960
He told me he felt lightheaded
this morning.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.485
I told him he was probably
just tired from the travel.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.967
I need to know
he's gonna be okay

24:07.010 --> 24:08.838
because if he's not,
then I'm not.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.494
Okay. Uh, let me go
see what I can find out.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.235
Can you --
Can you watch them for me?

24:14.278 --> 24:16.237
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.896
Alright, I'll see if
the last sample count's done.

24:22.939 --> 24:23.940
And prep for the next one.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.812
Maybe we won't
need another one.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.815
Unbridled optimism.
I like it.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.599
You ever work
on a project for years

24:30.643 --> 24:31.948
and then it just folded?

24:31.992 --> 24:33.297
Years? No.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.603
Months? Yes.

24:34.647 --> 24:35.822
What did you do?

24:35.865 --> 24:38.520
I rented a house in Hawaii
for the summer.

24:38.564 --> 24:42.263
Um, learned how to surf
and grow my own pineapple,

24:42.306 --> 24:43.917
and came back
and started again.

24:43.960 --> 24:44.961
You ever want to give up?

24:45.005 --> 24:46.310
Of course.

24:46.354 --> 24:50.358
But when everything
falls into place

24:50.401 --> 24:52.186
and all the stars align

24:52.229 --> 24:53.535
and you find that thing

24:53.579 --> 24:56.277
that you weren't even sure
was possible,

24:56.320 --> 24:57.887
there is this feeling

24:57.931 --> 25:01.761
of intense satisfaction
and pure joy

25:01.804 --> 25:04.328
that makes all the rest of it
melt away.

25:04.372 --> 25:07.157
And it turns all the waiting
and the setbacks

25:07.201 --> 25:09.986
and the disappointment
into something worthwhile.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.162
And I think that can be

25:12.206 --> 25:14.556
as beautiful
as the science itself.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.909
Hey! Hey!
It's beeping!

25:29.440 --> 25:30.790
79%.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.095
We had such a breakthrough

25:32.139 --> 25:33.488
when we figured out
the thermal coating.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.621
Nothing's really moved
the needle since.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.016
Dr. Shepherd?

25:40.060 --> 25:41.757
We know the dopamine cells
are cold going into the syringe

25:41.801 --> 25:44.455
and that the thermal insulation
is holding that temperature.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.979
But they're gaining heat
when they hit the brain,

25:46.022 --> 25:48.634
so that has to happen
between here and here.

25:48.677 --> 25:49.983
The needle.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.288
What if we could
keep the cells cold

25:51.332 --> 25:52.507
inside the needle?

25:55.641 --> 25:56.859
What are
you doing?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.687
We can't fit the whole thing
in the freezer.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.301
Meredith:
Working on getting

26:04.345 --> 26:06.913
better exposure
of the adrenal vein.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.262
Dr. Wright, can you g--

26:08.305 --> 26:09.959
Give more countertraction
on the liver?

26:10.003 --> 26:11.570
Absolutely.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.919
Let's work
on these adhesions.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.747
You think you'll have
adequate visualization?

26:14.790 --> 26:16.009
I do.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.532
And you'll avoid getting
into the vena cava?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.186
Dr. Marsh,
would you like to scrub in?

26:19.229 --> 26:21.231
No, no, no. No, no.
I'm good. You got it.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.146
His anatomy on the right
seems similar

26:23.190 --> 26:24.670
to what you described
on the left.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.149
Yes. Well, you have
to avoid the kidney.

26:26.193 --> 26:27.977
- He can't lose it.
- Not my plan.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.849
He's hypertensive
and tachycardic.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.807
Let's hit him with 5 milligrams
of phentolamine.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.548
Why's his pressure
all over the place?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.028
What about
pushing Esmolol?

26:35.071 --> 26:37.160
I think you put too much
pressure on the adrenal gland.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.510
You need to get control
of the adrenal vein right now.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.035
BP's going down.
Okay.
Taking the adrenal vein.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.515
Dr. Marsh,
do you need to step out?

26:44.559 --> 26:45.560
I'm sorry.
Excuse me?

26:45.604 --> 26:46.953
I'm asking
if you're too invested

26:46.996 --> 26:48.955
in this patient
and need to step out.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.435
Because you're right.
He does only have one kidney,

26:51.479 --> 26:52.872
and right now
I'm responsible for it.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.917
So you either
don't trust me or --

26:54.961 --> 26:56.658
Well, I'm responsible
for the other one.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.487
Brian's my donor.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.315
He's been my best friend
since we were 5 years old.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.230
And he saved my life
by giving me a kidney.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.101
Step out.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.189
Meredith, I'm fine.

27:06.233 --> 27:09.149
Dr. Marsh,
get out of the OR.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.428
Got your page.
What do you got?

27:27.471 --> 27:30.213
31-year-old male with CCTGA
and an open femur fracture.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.693
He fell about 10 feet.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.651
Ladder?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.130
Hair.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.741
He's the prince
in "Rapunzel."

27:35.784 --> 27:37.133
He had CPR in the field,

27:37.177 --> 27:39.005
as well as multiple shocks
from an AED.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.223
I'm almost done
with his ex-fix,

27:40.267 --> 27:42.008
but he's having
various arrhythmias.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.662
We already tried
transcutaneous pacing.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.880
Well, maybe he had
a potassium surge

27:44.924 --> 27:46.316
when you released
the tourniquet.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.319
Alright,
we got a pulse with that?

27:49.363 --> 27:50.973
- No pulse.
- Alright.
Start compressions.

27:51.017 --> 27:51.974
Lose the C-arm.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.323
Someone get me
antiseptic.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.847
Bokhee,
can you gown me, please?

27:54.890 --> 27:57.023
Let's get him Betadine
and a temporary pacing kit.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.198
Thank you.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.682
Do you prefer using EBVS
in these kind of cases?

28:03.725 --> 28:06.206
I find it efficient.
We've got some oozing --

28:06.249 --> 28:08.208
I've got
your hemostatic agent.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.863
Okay.
Exactly right.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.866
I can see why you're Dr. Marsh's
favorite resident.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.128
Thank you.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.738
That means a lot coming
from you, Dr. Grey.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.305
You're part
of a medical legacy.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.524
My mother was one
of the greats.

28:20.568 --> 28:23.266
I meant that you studied under
the esteemed Miranda Bailey.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.659
You know Dr. Bailey?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.966
I saw her lecture
on preventing post-op fistulas

28:27.009 --> 28:28.315
when I was in med school.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.490
Then I watched every one

28:29.533 --> 28:31.144
of her surgical videos
that I could find.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.146
There's one
of this Whipple.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.800
When she did
the mucosal anastomosis,

28:34.843 --> 28:37.324
her PDS sutures were
all in one motion.

28:37.367 --> 28:38.673
It's like she'd been
doing it forever.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.676
Except she was
a first-year attending.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.199
I'd give anything
to learn her techniques,

28:43.243 --> 28:45.027
so assisting you today

28:45.071 --> 28:46.812
is a highlight
of my residency.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.075
Why didn't you apply
for residency at Grey-Sloan?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.729
I did.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.947
Didn't match.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.514
Broke my heart.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.779
Can I take two?
Absolutely.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.302
Thank you.

28:59.346 --> 29:02.088
Bailey! Hi!

29:02.131 --> 29:03.742
I came back early!
Hi, Dr. Lin.

29:03.785 --> 29:04.960
Hi.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.919
Winston
is still parking the car.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.268
I'm so sorry
we're late.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.138
Pepperoni?

29:09.182 --> 29:10.357
It's deep dish!

29:10.400 --> 29:12.881
Chicago Lutheran
had it flown in.

29:12.925 --> 29:13.926
Do you want a piece? I can
always just get another one --

29:13.969 --> 29:16.624
No, I do not
want your pizza.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.367
- Is everything okay?
- Okay?

29:20.410 --> 29:22.673
No, everything is not okay,
but, hey,

29:22.717 --> 29:24.806
now that you're here,
maybe you can fix it.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.721
Yeah.
I mean, you're a...

29:26.765 --> 29:29.855
world-class
cardiothoracic surgeon!

29:32.901 --> 29:35.948
It doesn't matter
if you didn't bring swag.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.428
Medical marijuana
is legal in Seattle.

29:38.472 --> 29:41.823
Maybe we should have given out
weed gummies to the students.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.303
That's actually
not a bad idea.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.044
Stop it.
It is a terrible idea.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.526
- We never handed out pizza.
- No.

29:49.570 --> 29:53.052
We never threw
free gifts at people.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.968
Never even
offered pens.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.798
Because <i>we've</i>
<i>been enough.</i>

29:59.841 --> 30:02.757
The doctors who work here
have been enough, right?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.454
They used to line up!

30:04.498 --> 30:06.021
They used to want <i>us.</i>

30:06.065 --> 30:07.936
Now, what,
we're supposed to beg

30:07.980 --> 30:09.068
for their attention?

30:09.111 --> 30:11.679
And give them toys
to try to hold it?

30:11.722 --> 30:13.812
Do you want
to take a break?

30:13.855 --> 30:15.944
Yes, I do.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.120
A nice, long one.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.730
Okay.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.258
You used a frozen needle
for this sample, too?

30:25.301 --> 30:28.391
Yes. We are trying them
at different temperatures.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.392
You know, when I fell,

30:29.436 --> 30:30.785
my granddaughter
was at the house.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.439
She's 12.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.615
It scared her.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.138
It scared me.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.748
Okay. The injector's set.
We're ready for the needle.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.054
Please, God.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.186
How cold is that one?

30:40.229 --> 30:41.840
Three degrees Celsius.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.450
One degree colder
than the one in the counter.

30:43.493 --> 30:44.886
What if it freezes
the cells?

30:44.930 --> 30:47.802
Well, then
we try again.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.108
Okay.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.979
We should inject
before it warms up.

30:51.023 --> 30:51.762
Mm-hmm.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.242
Looks good.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.900
Can I just confirm
that the --

30:58.944 --> 31:00.293
Okay,
with all due respect,

31:00.336 --> 31:01.903
we are trying very hard
to make this project viable.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.688
And your constant questions
are not helping.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.475
I'm sorry.
Um...

31:08.518 --> 31:09.780
what do you
want to know?

31:09.824 --> 31:13.001
The FDA viability requirement --
They want 90%?

31:13.045 --> 31:14.176
Correct.

31:14.220 --> 31:17.049
Because your last sample
is currently...

31:18.267 --> 31:19.660
...at 92%.

31:19.703 --> 31:20.835
Yes!

31:20.879 --> 31:23.925
Sorry. But yes!

31:23.969 --> 31:25.709
We might cure Parkinson's.

31:25.753 --> 31:29.322
Oh, God, I hope
I didn't run off your sister.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.724
What are those faces?
I-Is he...?

31:40.768 --> 31:42.335
- Jeremy's okay.
- Oh, my God.

31:42.378 --> 31:43.466
Well,
we do have to put in

31:43.510 --> 31:45.120
a permanent pacemaker
while he's here,

31:45.164 --> 31:46.643
but he should be fine.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.950
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.822
Oh, thank you so much!
Y'all are superheroes.

31:51.866 --> 31:52.867
We're glad we could help.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.824
Uh, can I see him?

31:53.868 --> 31:55.435
I don't care
if he's sleeping.

31:55.478 --> 31:56.871
He's my best friend.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.829
I just want to see for myself
that he's okay.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.135
Yeah.
Come with me.

32:05.488 --> 32:10.145
That woman
is not good at pretending.

32:10.189 --> 32:13.148
That's a harsh review
for a kids' show.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.671
No, she, uh --

32:14.715 --> 32:16.673
she keeps saying the prince
is her best friend,

32:16.717 --> 32:19.241
but she is so clearly
in love with him.

32:20.634 --> 32:21.765
Maybe it's both.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.202
What?

32:23.245 --> 32:24.725
Like best friends
who got married?

32:24.768 --> 32:25.987
Like Hunt and Altman?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.989
Or, you know,
you have a crush,

32:28.033 --> 32:30.992
and you work through it
and become best friends.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.124
Like us.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.126
I never had
a crush on you.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.518
Not <i>you.</i>

32:35.562 --> 32:36.476
Me.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.000
What are you
talking about?

32:39.044 --> 32:41.176
I had a <i>huge</i> crush
on you.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.699
Why do you think
I worked at Jimmy's

32:42.743 --> 32:44.353
the summer
<i>after</i> I graduated?

32:44.397 --> 32:46.181
It wasn't for the tips
in quarters.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.271
Then you set me up
with Bronwyn,

32:49.315 --> 32:50.577
who eventually
broke my heart.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.319
And you started
dating Paul.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.494
He was such a bad guy,

32:54.537 --> 32:56.496
I figured you needed
a best friend.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.106
So here we are.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.716
And thank God
because I don't know

32:59.760 --> 33:01.501
what I'd be doing without you
right now.

33:02.545 --> 33:05.200
Okay, um...
I'm gonna go change.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.768
And then we can grab some dinner
on the way home?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.797
They're settling Brian
in the PACU now.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.451
Tumor is out.

33:38.494 --> 33:39.930
There was
minimal bleeding.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.716
No damage to the kidney
at all.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.545
And he will need follow-up,
but he'll recover nicely.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.069
Thank you.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.853
Thanks.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.293
We, uh, played
Little League,

33:54.336 --> 33:56.382
went camping every summer.

33:57.948 --> 34:01.561
When my mom died,
I basically lived at his house.

34:01.604 --> 34:03.998
He and his wife co-parented
Charlotte with me,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.826
and I can't tell you
how many dialysis sessions

34:05.869 --> 34:08.785
he sat through with me,
so...

34:08.829 --> 34:09.960
Which is exactly why

34:10.004 --> 34:11.310
you shouldn't have
been in there.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.485
I know. I know.

34:12.528 --> 34:13.529
I...

34:15.575 --> 34:16.706
I just --

34:16.750 --> 34:18.317
I didn't want to put
that burden on you.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.972
I didn't want to make you
personally invested because,

34:22.016 --> 34:23.583
if God forbid
something terrible happened,

34:23.626 --> 34:25.672
I didn't want
to put that on you.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.589
I'm always
personally invested.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.982
The second I walk in the room,
I'm personally invested,

34:32.026 --> 34:33.288
whether I know them
or not.

34:33.332 --> 34:35.464
And if I don't know their story,
I make one up.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.640
There is no such thing

34:37.684 --> 34:40.295
as just a body on a table
for me...

34:40.339 --> 34:42.167
ever.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.864
So you can
give me the burden.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.605
I can handle it.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.914
When you operated
on me...

34:52.742 --> 34:54.570
...you make up a story?

34:54.614 --> 34:56.398
You told me
your whole life story

34:56.442 --> 34:58.139
before I even
had your IV in.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.620
Oh, yeah.
That's true.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.578
Well, I owe you...

35:02.622 --> 35:03.753
big time.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.104
And if we're keeping score,
that's two.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.149
And I usually
don't call in IOUs,

35:08.193 --> 35:10.282
but today I might
actually do it.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.805
Okay.

35:27.342 --> 35:31.520
"Your talents will soon be
recognized and adored..."

35:33.305 --> 35:34.610
You're supposed say
"in bed."

35:34.654 --> 35:35.785
Right.

35:35.829 --> 35:36.743
In bed.

35:42.618 --> 35:43.576
I --

35:44.925 --> 35:47.188
I Googled Rapunzel.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.409
After she's banished
and the prince goes blind,

35:50.452 --> 35:53.847
he finds her singing
in the forest.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.545
Her tears of joy
restore his sight,

35:56.589 --> 35:58.895
and they get their
happy ending...

35:58.939 --> 36:02.682
even though it didn't go the way
they thought it would go.

36:02.725 --> 36:04.466
Maybe we'll still
get ours.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.424
Hmm.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.948
We just need
some magic tears.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.428
I'm serious.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.561
What if all the crap
that we've been through

36:12.605 --> 36:15.434
is just the middle part
of the story...

36:15.477 --> 36:17.044
the part you have
to go through

36:17.087 --> 36:20.003
to find
your happily ever after?

36:20.047 --> 36:23.529
Because when two people have
been there for each other

36:23.572 --> 36:25.531
over and over,

36:25.574 --> 36:30.231
through the worst that
humanity has to offer...

36:30.275 --> 36:32.190
don't they deserve
to be happy?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.237
You're right.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.891
Jo, you're right.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.675
I've been holding
onto a fairytale,

36:39.719 --> 36:42.025
and it doesn't --
it doesn't have to be that.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.378
I love...

36:46.421 --> 36:47.683
Amelia.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.469
And I'm -- And I'm so deeply
in love with her.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.646
I can wait. I-I don't --
I don't have to get married now.

36:53.689 --> 36:56.170
I just need her.
Right?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.215
Right.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.218
Should I call her?

37:00.261 --> 37:02.307
S-Should I, uh,
go to her house and wait?

37:02.350 --> 37:04.265
Oh, I-I should -- I should
pick her up at the airport.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.441
I wonder what time she gets in.
Where's my phone?

37:06.485 --> 37:07.921
<i>The invention </i>
of the microscope

37:07.964 --> 37:10.750
<i> turned the scientific community </i>
on its head.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.883
<i>It gave scientists a whole new </i>
way of looking at things.

37:13.927 --> 37:16.234
<i>For the first time, </i>
they could see cells

37:16.277 --> 37:18.148
<i>and things they couldn't </i>
with the naked eye.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.802
I thought you never
left the clinic.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.849
Only when I've had
a major breakthrough

37:22.892 --> 37:24.154
and to feed my cat.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.288
You saved
our project today.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.812
We're lucky to have you
as our lead neurosurgeon.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.945
Oh, it was
a group effort.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.120
And the surgery is not

37:33.163 --> 37:34.817
the most complex part
of this project.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.210
Maybe.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.212
But a lot of other neurosurgeons
would have passed.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.301
The risk of failure's
too big.

37:40.345 --> 37:43.826
But you're driven as much
by the process as the outcome.

37:45.524 --> 37:46.829
There's a big difference

37:46.873 --> 37:49.223
between not giving up
and being good.

37:50.529 --> 37:53.314
I don't think Meredith Grey
suffers fools.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.274
The way I see it...

37:56.317 --> 37:59.233
is you fell in love with neuro
when you were 4

37:59.277 --> 38:01.888
and you wanted to see
where feelings came from.

38:01.931 --> 38:03.716
And you still love it.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.326
Your eyes light up
when you look at brains,

38:05.370 --> 38:07.807
even the plastic ones.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.461
And you're unrelenting.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.158
You don't settle.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.246
And that's what matters

38:12.290 --> 38:14.466
when you want
to break new ground.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.122
I'm glad today
worked out.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.385
Me, too.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.778
It means we get
to keep working together.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.999
You want to celebrate?
Grab some dinner?

38:27.217 --> 38:28.393
I have to catch
a plane.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.485
But I will see you
next week.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.138
Mm-hmm.

38:35.182 --> 38:38.620
<i>The simple use of curved glass </i>
to bend and refract light

38:38.664 --> 38:41.406
<i>revolutionized </i>
how we see the world.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.147
<i>In many ways,</i>

38:44.191 --> 38:46.367
<i>it's not all that different </i>
from everyday life.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.506
Do you have a minute?

38:54.549 --> 38:55.724
Not if you're
gonna tell me

38:55.768 --> 38:57.726
that you've been appointed
Surgeon General.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.989
I'm sorry
I wasn't at the convention.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.426
Doesn't matter.
None of it does.

39:01.469 --> 39:04.298
You know, for years,
I've spent all of my energy

39:04.342 --> 39:05.647
recruiting the best.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.170
Then I train them.

39:07.214 --> 39:10.260
I watch their every move,
I teach them everything I know,

39:10.304 --> 39:12.611
and then they take
all that knowledge

39:12.654 --> 39:14.787
and go off to make
groundbreaking,

39:14.830 --> 39:17.224
world-changing contributions
to medicine.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.140
Meanwhile,
I'm still spending a whole day

39:20.183 --> 39:23.317
standing on a sidewalk
next to a folding table,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.188
trying to convince
a bunch of medical students

39:25.232 --> 39:26.320
who look like teenagers

39:26.364 --> 39:28.235
that I am worth
their time.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.889
Do -- Uh,
do you need something?

39:29.932 --> 39:32.631
I have someone
I would like you meet.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.980
W--

39:37.462 --> 39:38.811
Dr. Miranda Bailey,

39:38.854 --> 39:41.727
I would like you to meet
Dr. Jordan Wright.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.077
He's a resident in Minnesota,

39:44.120 --> 39:46.035
but he would like to transfer
to Grey-Sloan.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.386
We did a surgery together.
He's excellent.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.997
Nice to meet you,
Dr. Wright.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.782
And tell me why you're
interested in Grey-Sloan?

39:53.826 --> 39:55.958
You, Dr. Bailey.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.133
I want to learn
from <i>you.</i>

40:01.007 --> 40:02.443
I'm listening.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.315
First of all...

40:05.359 --> 40:07.492
<i>Sometimes seeing life </i>
through a different lens

40:07.535 --> 40:09.972
<i>opens a new world </i>
of possibilities.
