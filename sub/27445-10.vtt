WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.171
The problems with living
with other vampires

00:03.204 --> 00:05.073
are the vampires
I have chosen to stay with.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.640
-I will kill you!
-Aaah!

00:06.674 --> 00:10.744
What We Do in the Shadows,
all new Wednesdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.350
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.021
(birds chirping)

00:30.198 --> 00:32.200
(footfalls approaching)

00:38.239 --> 00:40.208
You look nice.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.243
MARIAH:
Thanks. You, too.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.681
(Jimmy sighs)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.717
(Mariah sighs)

00:54.588 --> 00:56.557
You got it right.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.526
For once.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.428
I resent that.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.631
I love weddings.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.666
("Hey My Man" by Babes playing)

01:08.602 --> 01:10.438
-(video game sound effects)
-* Fill the drain *

01:10.471 --> 01:13.274
* Turn on the shower *

01:13.307 --> 01:15.276
* Wash your face *

01:15.309 --> 01:17.478
* Till you're clean
as a flower *

01:17.511 --> 01:19.913
* Are you all alone? *

01:19.947 --> 01:22.283
* And you wanna cry *

01:22.316 --> 01:24.752
* When you're all alone *

01:27.588 --> 01:32.160
* Every day's a new chance... *

01:32.193 --> 01:35.229
-(yells)
-(clatters)

01:35.263 --> 01:38.866
Damn it. My game is on there.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.673
* Ooh *

01:58.786 --> 02:00.087
Oh.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.490
(toilet flushes)

02:07.228 --> 02:10.431
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

02:10.464 --> 02:12.533
* I'm gonna
leave you anyway *

02:12.566 --> 02:14.968
* I'm gonna leave you anyway. *

02:22.910 --> 02:24.712
Coffee?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.947
29 days.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.450
Can you believe it?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.285
Until our wedding.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.687
Right, that. Crazy.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.524
Coffee?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.626
Do we have any travel mugs?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.561
Got to get over to the event
space, like, yesterday.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.995
-(clears throat)
-(gasps)

02:42.029 --> 02:44.665
-Got you something.
-Fuck yeah. Gimme.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.875
Shoes?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.510
Dope shoes.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.846
Yeah. Not just any dope shoes.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.681
Dope wedding shoes.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.317
-I got some as well.
-Gretchen confused.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.353
I've been reading up
on some common wedding mistakes,

03:05.386 --> 03:09.056
and it turns out most people
forget to break in their shoes.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.758
So you want me
to wear these today?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.861
The one day my job requires me
to walk around a bunch?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.732
Have you been there
the whole time?

03:18.766 --> 03:21.201
-Mm-hmm.
-(gasps) Wow.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.671
I've gotten really good
at tuning you out.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.839
Why do you have to walk around
a bunch today?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.909
Oh, well, thank you
for asking, Edgar!

03:28.942 --> 03:32.680
It's only the biggest event
of my career.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.349
Sam and the boys
are dropping a new joint,

03:35.383 --> 03:38.252
so I organized
this phat listening party

03:38.286 --> 03:40.421
as their big comeback. Plus,

03:40.454 --> 03:43.190
I convinced them to throw
Nock Nock a verse.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.094
Double plus, I billed him
as this big mystery guest

03:47.127 --> 03:50.030
to get all the hip-hop writers
thirsty A.F. to attend.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.231
Genius, huh?

03:51.265 --> 03:53.200
Look at us.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.370
Just a couple of hotties,
ready to get married,

03:56.404 --> 03:57.771
-from the ankles down.
-(phone vibrates, chimes)

03:57.805 --> 03:59.307
XL is coming?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.575
(gasps)
Fuck.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.583
-(door closes)
-What?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.819
How stupid are you?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.788
Who are you talking to?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.824
Gretchen has a very important
event tonight,

04:16.857 --> 04:19.893
and you don't even react,
let alone volunteer to go.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.929
Why are you talking to me
like this? What's happening?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.964
I don't know.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.735
Best I can figure,
now that we're cowriters,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.938
I'm spontaneously reevaluating
our relationship

04:30.971 --> 04:33.841
and realizing... nah.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.476
-Nah?
-Anyway,

04:35.509 --> 04:37.244
you and Gretchen--
I have thoughts.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.514
You can be unsupportive to her
now, but that will not fly

04:40.548 --> 04:43.851
-once you're married.
-I am incredibly supportive.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.086
You guys are supposed to be
creating a life together.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.689
The only way that works
is if you take active interest

04:48.722 --> 04:50.324
in the parts
of each other's lives

04:50.358 --> 04:52.025
that don't directly affect you.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.428
Why would I do that?

04:54.462 --> 04:56.697
Because otherwise, you'll never
really be a couple.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.533
You'll just be two people.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.203
Let's get to work on the script.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.271
Okay.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.306
(typing)

05:12.546 --> 05:14.748
(ringtone playing)

05:17.317 --> 05:19.286
Mike, don't forget
to not let me forget

05:19.319 --> 05:20.888
to text Sway in the Morning
in the morning.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.890
I mean, tomorrow morning.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.925
Figure it out! Bye.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.162
Ooh, what are you doing?

05:29.196 --> 05:32.966
Boss shit. Walk with me.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.136
Can you believe this place?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.539
It's an old asbestos factory.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.374
I found it advertised
on Craigslist

05:40.408 --> 05:42.410
as a hipster wedding venue.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.411
Cool, huh?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.913
Yep. Real dope.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.015
If tonight doesn't
go flawlessly,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.317
Yvette is gonna have
my ovaries on a platter.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.520
That woman plays like
she's warm and caring,

05:52.553 --> 05:55.589
but that ho once fired a dude
for getting ball cancer.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.825
Sure, but shouldn't you be
doing wedding shit?

05:57.858 --> 06:01.094
-It's 29 days away.
-Why does everyone know that?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.564
Remember when you made us all
download that wedding app

06:03.597 --> 06:05.999
'cause it came with a coupon
for Souplantation?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.069
Oh, right-- what the fuck?
I never got my soup.

06:09.102 --> 06:13.173
Look, if I can do this, I can
easily pull off getting married.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.042
What those words mean?

06:15.075 --> 06:18.211
This job is not something I ever
wanted, but now that I have it,

06:18.245 --> 06:20.848
I realize how important
it is to me.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.450
So I'm gonna really try
for once,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.684
really knock it out of the park.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.085
Huh?

06:25.118 --> 06:27.788
Jimmy is my job
in this metaphor.

06:27.821 --> 06:31.224
Oh! That's really smart.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.626
Why are you dressed like that?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.394
My smart girl clothes?

06:34.428 --> 06:36.597
Well, I have a date tonight,

06:36.630 --> 06:40.400
and the guy's profile says
he reads books, so...

06:40.434 --> 06:42.269
(chuckles) Lindsay,
you're not doing that thing

06:42.302 --> 06:45.038
where you try on a new identity
for a man again, are you?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.440
What? I don't do that.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.941
You spent last week
at Burning Man

06:47.975 --> 06:49.376
with that dude you met off Raya.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.613
Don't bring Burner culture
into this.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.048
-(screams)
-Bitch, you are jumpy as hell.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.650
What's wrong with you?

06:56.684 --> 06:59.219
Nothing. Walk with me.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.289
Oh, a walk and talk?
Hell yeah.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.724
You heard the track yet?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.226
Ugh, no. Crap.
I've been so busy.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.295
For once, I believe you.

07:08.328 --> 07:11.565
Yeah, it's like an actual
competent person planned this.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.635
Geez, maybe you'll even be able
to handle being married.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.069
That's what I said.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.138
This is your room.
I will check in later.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.941
-I-I'm Honey Nutz.
-She knows.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.977
This RSVP list is so long,

07:24.011 --> 07:26.146
somebody's gonna call
the fire marshal.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.448
I can't wait for the recap.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.083
Y-You're not staying?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.820
Forcing my staff to go
on a team-building retreat

07:32.853 --> 07:35.422
just so I can have
the office to myself

07:35.455 --> 07:39.927
is my form of getting drunk
at a listening party.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.864
Don't ever become a boss,
Gretchen. It sucks.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.933
What it do? What it d...?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.536
Oh, no.
Where do all those doors go?

07:48.569 --> 07:51.805
Your green room is over there.
I'll check in soon.

07:56.376 --> 08:00.213
I hope you understand
the magnitude of this event.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.149
It's not just your ass
on the line.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.485
I really want you to rise
to the occasion, Gretchen.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.155
I'll try. Got to fix that light!

08:10.824 --> 08:13.393
Hey! You have a face I've seen.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.862
Can I get a ride back
to the office?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.530
Um, sure.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.533
As long as you keep that shit
off my leather seats.

08:19.567 --> 08:23.036
Oh, no. Don't worry.
This is all going in my mouth.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.741
(typing)

08:27.775 --> 08:29.376
And...

08:29.409 --> 08:31.645
done with the adult
breastfeeding scene.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.981
Plus, I made a list
of some great pub names.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.717
Ready?
The Erstwhile Butler.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.353
First of all, I don't have the
mental bandwidth to stay attuned

08:40.387 --> 08:42.890
to Gretchen's
every little mood shift.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.059
Fine. Hogwash and Smeagan.
That might be my favorite...

08:46.093 --> 08:48.195
Secondly, it is precisely
because Gretchen and I

08:48.228 --> 08:50.063
lead separate lives that we're
such a successful couple.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.498
EDGAR:
The Blunt Governess.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.601
The Exchequer's Folly.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.570
If we were to share every iota
of our lives with each other,

08:56.604 --> 08:58.171
there would be nothing
to talk about.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.107
The Fox and Ferret.
The Bullfrog's Ale-Wife.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.110
Counter-instinctually, it is
separation that draws us closer.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.778
Farthings.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.847
And that keen understanding
of the human psyche

09:06.880 --> 09:10.250
is exactly why I am the one
making mid-to-high six figures

09:10.283 --> 09:11.952
for a screenplay
while you're here

09:11.985 --> 09:13.386
stuck pitching me pub names.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.889
Hmm.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.895
Where do you think you're going?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.564
To go for a walk
and find somewhere quiet

09:24.598 --> 09:25.966
to write the V-Day scene.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.902
-Maybe the park.
-But I was talking to you.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.705
And I didn't like the way
you were talking to me,

09:31.739 --> 09:35.943
so I am calmly removing myself
from the situation.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.244
Fine.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.879
We'll go write in the park.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.381
It'll give me a chance
to break in my shoes.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.983
Edgar, I said fine.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.020
Wait for me.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.825
(laughs) Which is why I'm
wearing my smart girl outfit,

09:51.859 --> 09:53.894
even though my friend said
it was a bad idea.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.396
But what does she know? She
and Jimmy are exactly the same.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.765
Most people have
to change a little

09:57.798 --> 09:59.232
to make sure someone likes them.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.901
And anyway, who knows?
I could read books.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.837
(gasps)
Whoa! No one's here!

10:03.871 --> 10:07.107
Which means
the bosses aren't here.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.811
Well, I'm here,
and I need to get to work.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.147
Let's do something fun,
like rolly chair races!

10:14.181 --> 10:16.616
Whee!

10:16.650 --> 10:20.487
Oh! Or leave fake love notes
in people's offices.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.490
Really fuck some people up.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.593
(laughs)
Lindsay, you're very amusing,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.595
but I truly need to get to work.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.199
I know! Let's raid the fridge
for leftovers.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.037
(chuckles)
Who brings the best stuff?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.875
-Well, always go Colin first.
-Yeah.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.343
Then Rebecca, Torshiro,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.645
that weird guy from Accounting
with the thing on his neck.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.147
Ooh, yeah. Gross.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.648
* Don't be jealous *

10:48.682 --> 10:50.217
* Don't be jealous,
don't be jealous *

10:50.250 --> 10:52.519
* One, two, Nock Nock's
coming for you *

10:52.552 --> 10:54.855
* Three, four,
Nock Nock's at your door *

10:54.888 --> 10:57.991
* Five, six,
now you got syphilis *

10:58.025 --> 11:00.861
* Seven, eight, bitch,
it's way too late! *

11:00.894 --> 11:03.396
(screams)
* This is mayhem *

11:03.430 --> 11:06.066
* Nock Nock coming straight from
your a.m., I'm the illest *

11:06.099 --> 11:07.567
* I got illness,
I'm the trillest *

11:07.600 --> 11:08.635
* I write thrillers... *

11:08.668 --> 11:10.871
Did your boy bring it or what?

11:10.904 --> 11:15.642
You absolutely brought it.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.245
I can't believe
you were that good.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.813
Me neither.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.183
I guess working with my idols
made me step up.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.385
Usually it's just me
in the shower

11:25.418 --> 11:27.054
and Charles on the toilet
running the beat.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.722
Oh, dang, I forgot
to remind the sitter

11:28.756 --> 11:30.858
to crush up Charles' medication
in his Tuna Helper.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.760
I'll let you get to that.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.364
Hey, Gretchen.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.132
Thanks for believing in me.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.074
-JIMMY: Let me explain
something to you.
-EDGAR: Mm-hmm.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.043
To primitive people,
the unknown, like,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.879
"Will the sun come up tomorrow?"

11:51.912 --> 11:55.548
and "Why did a woolly mammoth
just crush my Uncle Thag?"

11:55.582 --> 11:58.018
was so unfathomably terrifying

11:58.051 --> 12:00.888
that they would make up myths
to give a false order

12:00.921 --> 12:04.858
-to what seemed like
a capricious, entropic world.
-Hmm.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.560
JIMMY: And this same type
of magical thinking

12:07.594 --> 12:11.198
is why certain couples do
everything together.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.467
Tammy and Bernard both go
to his dermatologist appointment

12:14.501 --> 12:18.205
because they think the combined
force of their love and devotion

12:18.238 --> 12:20.407
will keep it
from being melanoma,

12:20.440 --> 12:21.608
but it won't.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.710
Do you know what will
keep it from being,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.813
metaphorically speaking,
melanoma?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.381
Being fucking interesting.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.717
Remaining interesting
as individuals

12:30.750 --> 12:35.122
will stave off the malignancy
that is romantic complacency,

12:35.155 --> 12:37.724
not thirstily doing
everything together,

12:37.757 --> 12:39.993
like Charles and Camilla

12:40.027 --> 12:42.796
or the Property Brothers.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.465
You can admit
you're scared to get married.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.902
-What? I'm not scared.
-It's okay, Jimmy.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.438
I no longer look up to you,
so you have no height

12:51.471 --> 12:52.840
from which to fall.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.641
Ah, I understand
what's happening.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.643
You're pushing me away
before I get married

12:56.676 --> 12:58.111
and you're left out in the cold.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.147
I didn't ask for this to happen,
it just did.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.750
Like when Neo saw the Matrix,
I now see you as my equal.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.153
Well, stop it.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.188
(choral group harmonizing)

13:35.382 --> 13:38.551
See? This illustrates
my point perfectly.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.020
This is something that Gretchen

13:40.053 --> 13:42.455
would absolutely
lose her shit over.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.325
But if she were here,
experiencing what I experience,

13:45.358 --> 13:46.793
what would there be to say?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.561
"Ooh, that was cool."
"I agree."

13:48.595 --> 13:50.230
"Should we just give up
and die now?"

13:50.263 --> 13:51.932
"Sure."

13:59.606 --> 14:02.342
-That was cool.
-Yeah, it really was.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.711
And if you were together, you
could've both experienced it.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.714
It would become part of the
fabric of your relationship

14:07.747 --> 14:11.051
as opposed to something
that just happened to you.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.854
Let's keep walking.
I need to break in my shoes.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.045
SAM: Bitch, you making me dizzy!
Just go ahead and tell us

14:38.078 --> 14:39.446
-what you fucked up!
-(groans)

14:39.479 --> 14:41.681
I was trying to think
of a profesh way to say this,

14:41.714 --> 14:46.386
but, uh... Ooh, you guys
suck ass on the track.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.955
No, that is unfair.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.857
You guys are very okay on it,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
but Nock Nock's verse
is so good,

14:52.926 --> 14:55.628
he makes you guys
sound like you suck ass.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.131
-Don't even start.
-I didn't say anything.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.532
What's going on?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.534
I told him Nock Nock
murdered us.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.603
We got to find something else
to play tonight.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.038
We playing that damn track.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.707
Do you really want to risk
getting embarrassed?

15:07.740 --> 15:12.445
I am an established artist
with a worldwide fan base.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.881
-Mm.
-Our okayest shit is worth more

15:14.914 --> 15:17.917
than that yellow-toothed
redneck's entire life!

15:17.951 --> 15:19.319
Come on, now!

15:19.352 --> 15:22.755
Would you rather buy
an amateur's best still life

15:22.789 --> 15:25.892
or a napkin scribble-scrabble
by Picasso?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.161
Would you rather eat
your Aunt Diane's

15:28.195 --> 15:31.098
beef bourguignon

15:31.131 --> 15:34.234
or a plate of scrambled eggs

15:34.267 --> 15:36.169
by Ludo Lefebvre?

15:36.203 --> 15:39.006
I got a version of the song
without Nock Nock.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.640
Great. We'll go with that.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.643
I mean, that's probably the
safer option, right? Yeah. Yeah.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.181
So I did a good job
and I'm being punished for it?

15:48.215 --> 15:51.084
I wouldn't say punished--
more like they want to nullify

15:51.118 --> 15:54.687
the existence of your verse
forever in a constructive way.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.857
You're playing
that track tonight.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.193
But I just told you I can't.

16:00.227 --> 16:03.296
Nah, you told me your dinosaur
clients are sad I murdered them.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.633
Wow, I thought Sam and the boys
were your heroes.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.602
Sure, but everybody's heroes
got to fall off at some point.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.972
I'm the future of hip-hop,
whether they like it or not.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.976
Play my shit, Gretchen.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.447
That's why I'm here.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.816
If you don't, I won't be here,

16:23.850 --> 16:26.353
or anywhere.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.521
I mean, I'll always be somewhere

16:28.555 --> 16:31.991
'cause matter can't ever
truly disappear.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.896
But I won't be with you.
Feel me?

16:41.068 --> 16:44.304
(giggles) So, after disc golf
on the playa,

16:44.337 --> 16:47.874
while I was being treated by
the medic for the scorpion bite,

16:47.907 --> 16:51.044
I had this feeling
of... acceptance.

16:51.078 --> 16:54.314
I fucking hated every minute
being in the desert

16:54.347 --> 16:57.417
with a bunch of dirty assholes,
but...

16:57.450 --> 17:01.354
I could learn to love it
for the right person.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.323
You can't force love.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.927
But I want it now!
I want someone to love me.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.062
I'm ready.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.430
I'll do whatever it takes,

17:10.463 --> 17:12.099
even if I have
to change my name,

17:12.132 --> 17:15.435
my hair, the date
on my birth certificate.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.270
I'll leave out
all the bad details of me,

17:17.304 --> 17:20.039
like that time I got an STD

17:20.073 --> 17:22.775
from that tall season four
American Idol loser.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.878
-Sanjaya?
-No, chlamydia.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.347
(laughs)

17:27.380 --> 17:30.250
What? I don't have it anymore.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.019
Stop looking for who to be.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.787
Because guess what.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.093
You already are her.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.795
I'm who?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.370
(sighs)

17:50.403 --> 17:52.372
* Take that lock and key *

17:52.405 --> 17:54.974
* Lock them dreams up for me *

17:55.007 --> 17:57.310
* Take that heart and soul *

17:57.344 --> 17:59.279
* And never let it go,
never let it go... *

17:59.312 --> 18:00.413
You good with this?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.915
Oh, hell yeah!

18:02.949 --> 18:05.785
* And make sure
you're on your way *

18:05.818 --> 18:09.289
* Be what you want to be,
want to be *

18:09.322 --> 18:11.624
* And I'm not worried
about yesterday *

18:11.658 --> 18:14.127
* And I'm not worried
about what tomorrow brings *

18:14.161 --> 18:16.996
* Oh, oh... *

18:17.029 --> 18:18.398
(line ringing)

18:18.431 --> 18:20.400
Hi! Oh, no.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.002
You're doing your intense
meth lady smoking thing.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.138
Is everything all right?

18:25.172 --> 18:27.507
-Where are you?
-Shit.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.809
No, it's not okay.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.744
I'm hiding in this
weird lifty thingy,

18:31.778 --> 18:34.080
because it turns out that Nock
Nock is a really good rapper

18:34.113 --> 18:36.283
and he made the boys look bad,
so now they're demanding

18:36.316 --> 18:37.750
that I play the version
without him.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.986
But Nock Nock knows
that he murdered them,

18:40.019 --> 18:42.422
so he's demanding
that I play his version.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.192
And our marriage depends on me
being able to work this out.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.260
-Huh?
-It's a metaphor, Jimmy.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.263
No matter what I do here,
I piss someone off.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.832
Did you just say Nock Nock's
a really good rapper?

18:52.865 --> 18:55.768
This is a serious crisis.
What should I do?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.637
Oh, okay.
Well, l-let's think.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.874
Perhaps there's someone nearby
whose entire vocation

19:01.908 --> 19:05.445
revolves around
handling crises. Huh?

19:05.478 --> 19:06.779
Oh, look there's one.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.181
Ha!

19:08.215 --> 19:09.849
Damn it.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.684
(groans)

19:11.718 --> 19:14.554
Thanks for answering.
I just needed to vent.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.588
Any time.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.129
You should be with her.
She's gonna do something dumb.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.699
Edgar, she told me her problem,
I listened and solved it.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.501
We had our separate experiences,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.737
then came together in the end,
just like I said.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.740
We don't need to be together
to be together.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.141
Then why did you lead us here?

19:35.174 --> 19:39.346
Look, when we came across
that zoo opera,

19:39.379 --> 19:41.648
all I wanted was
to see Gretchen smile,

19:41.681 --> 19:45.017
but when I turned around,
all I saw was your dumb face.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.186
Sorry. I suppose
you don't want me saying

19:47.220 --> 19:49.021
those kind of things
to you anymore.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.491
Nah, it's okay. It's kind of
a dumb face sometimes.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.693
Anyways, now that we're here,

19:53.726 --> 19:56.596
it'd be silly
not to go in, right?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.699
I think it would mean
a lot to her. Yes.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.771
* Like a preacher,
lay my hands on it *

20:04.804 --> 20:06.873
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:06.906 --> 20:08.775
* I don't want it, I don't want
it, I don't want it *

20:08.808 --> 20:11.844
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:11.878 --> 20:14.180
-* Goddamn *
-* Throw my cash on it *

20:14.213 --> 20:16.449
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:16.483 --> 20:19.286
What version am I playing?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.255
* I don't want it if it
ain't no ... on it *

20:22.289 --> 20:24.223
* I don't want it, I don't
want it, I don't want it *

20:24.257 --> 20:26.926
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it... *

20:26.959 --> 20:28.461
Play that one.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.263
* I don't, I *

20:30.297 --> 20:32.399
* Like a preacher,
lay my hands on it *

20:32.432 --> 20:35.535
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:35.568 --> 20:38.070
* I don't want it, I don't
want it, I don't want it *

20:38.104 --> 20:40.573
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:40.607 --> 20:43.042
-* Goddamn *
-* Throw my cash on it *

20:43.075 --> 20:46.479
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it *

20:46.513 --> 20:48.381
* Baby, grab on it *

20:48.415 --> 20:50.950
* I don't want it
if it ain't no ... on it... *

20:53.786 --> 20:56.155
JIMMY:
Gretchen! Gretchen!

20:56.188 --> 21:01.728
This is the first time
I've seen her walk with purpose.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.129
It's quite sexy.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.565
I'm glad we came.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.635
Me, too. Thank you.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.071
(air horn sound effect)

21:12.104 --> 21:15.007
SAM:
Okay, okay, okay, everybody!

21:15.041 --> 21:17.910
(people cheering)

21:17.944 --> 21:21.080
We appreciate y'all coming out
to hear our new shit!

21:21.113 --> 21:23.516
-Reboot!
-I'm Honey Nutz.

21:23.550 --> 21:27.153
But first let me introduce
to you the mystery artist

21:27.186 --> 21:29.589
y'all been waiting on.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.025
Give it up for my dude
Nock Nock.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.028
(cheering and applause)

21:36.062 --> 21:39.966
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll be
hearing his shit very soon.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.935
Very soon.
Like right now!

21:42.969 --> 21:44.337
(feedback)

21:44.371 --> 21:46.939
Actually, less soon than that.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.443
Hey, so what'd she say when you
confronted her about the pills?

21:50.477 --> 21:53.446
-Nothing. I didn't ask her.
-Why not?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.214
Because we don't do that.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.650
Jimmy, she's taking
more and more,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.285
and some
of the really weird stuff.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.554
She's fine.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.990
This isn't old depressed
Gretchen.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.993
She's up and about. She cares
about her job for once.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.461
She's fine.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.696
SAM:
...check out our new joint,

22:09.729 --> 22:12.832
featuring a beat
by DJ Squirt Squirt.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.735
"Don't Be Jealous"!

22:15.768 --> 22:17.069
HONEY NUTZ 2:
"Don't Be Jealous."

22:17.103 --> 22:18.971
Yo, hit it, DJ.
Drop that track.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.087
DJ:
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah...

22:35.121 --> 22:36.088
Where'd she go?

22:36.122 --> 22:37.524
DJ:
It's time to turn up,

22:37.557 --> 22:39.325
it's time to get...

22:39.358 --> 22:41.293
-(alarm ringing)
-(people shouting)

23:03.382 --> 23:06.352
-(Lindsay giggling)
-Stop. Stop.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.387
(both laugh)

23:08.421 --> 23:11.390
It was fun hanging out
in the boss's office.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.225
-Huh?
-That was really nice.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.228
I know this is
kind of fast, but...

23:16.262 --> 23:18.230
would you want
to get together sometime

23:18.264 --> 23:21.601
to maybe eat each other's
pussies again?

23:21.634 --> 23:26.372
No one's ever put it
quite that way, but...

23:26.405 --> 23:28.775
yeah, I think I do.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.043
-(chuckles)
-Ooh.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.312
-Huh?
-You have some lipstick.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.915
Are those mine?

23:38.150 --> 23:40.286
Keep 'em.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.222
(phone rings)

23:43.255 --> 23:45.658
Yes, this is...

23:45.692 --> 23:50.162
What? Well,
is there a fire or not?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.798
What's wrong?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.767
Sorry, I need to handle this.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.235
Good night, Miss Thompson.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.904
YVETTE:
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.439
Miss Thompson?

24:00.473 --> 24:02.074
All right,
I'll be there in a minute.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.342
Yvette Thomp...

24:03.375 --> 24:05.111

24:06.546 --> 24:08.515
(indistinct shouting)

24:08.548 --> 24:12.351
* When I saw you there
in the moonlight *

24:12.384 --> 24:14.821
* I started to cry *

24:16.856 --> 24:19.258
* For you were there
with another girl... *

24:19.291 --> 24:20.693
Ah...

24:20.727 --> 24:24.764
* And you were my guy *

24:24.797 --> 24:27.433
* And then I knew
that my plans *

24:27.466 --> 24:31.804
* And my dreams
now were all in vain *

24:31.838 --> 24:34.006
(siren wailing)

24:34.040 --> 24:36.776
* And the tears came tumbling *

24:36.809 --> 24:40.947
-* Whoa, tumbling *
-* Tears came tumbling *

24:40.980 --> 24:46.385
* Down like rain *

24:46.418 --> 24:48.721
* I watched you
holding her hand *

24:48.755 --> 24:52.525
* And you whisked her
so tenderly *

24:55.494 --> 24:59.465
* And I thought of the time
when I'd once loved you *

24:59.498 --> 25:02.501
* Here was me... *

25:07.073 --> 25:10.042
