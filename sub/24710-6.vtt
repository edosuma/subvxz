He buys a drink, you collar me
for serving underage.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.824
-Oh, I'm legal. I'll show you my license.
-My new partner Danny Sorenson.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.950
How's it going, Danny?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.452
Hey, I hope you don't mind
if I kid with you.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.704
-No, Andy told me you were a great kidder.
-LENNY: Yeah.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.788
Where's your car, Lenny?

15:14.955 --> 15:17.458
-My car?
-Yeah, where's your '94 Lumina?

15:17.833 --> 15:20.502
-Over where I live.
-You didn't drive to work today?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.755
It's three blocks, Danny. Prince Street.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.090
Oh, don't tell me
something happened with my car.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.426
It was used in a drive-by
this morning, Lenny.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.429
Now it's under the FDR
with two DOAs inside.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.513
Damaged?

15:32.014 --> 15:34.391
Yeah, your Lumina's
somewhat damaged, Lenny.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.435
Anybody else got a key for it?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.730
Say, you can chalk this up against that

15:39.855 --> 15:42.900
"Friends don't let friends drive drunk"
campaign.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.779
Ever since people started grabbing my keys
every time I got half a load on,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.239
I keep a spare set in the wheel well.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.617
See if you recognize these DOAs.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.286
These could be total strangers, Andy.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.997
Off the spare set being in the wheel well.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.917
-Yeah, your spare set.
-(LENNY SIGHS)

16:00.626 --> 16:03.504
I do recognize him. That's Frankie Pascal.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.885
-It's his cousin Dominic.
-They drank here?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.430
You got any suspects, Andy?

16:13.555 --> 16:16.350
These guys would be the suspects
in the original shooting,

16:16.475 --> 16:19.395
-before they themselves got shot.
-The dead Pascal cousins?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.647
You know Julio Diaz, Lenny?

16:21.855 --> 16:24.358
-Who's that now?
-Julio's the original shooting victim.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.111
And then maybe his friends
went after the Pascals.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.448
Julio Diaz? Nope, Don't ring a bell.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.952
I mean, maybe if I seen him.
Or did he get killed, too?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.246
No, he wasn't killed.
He got shot in the shoulder.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.666
You know. I'll tell ya,

16:40.958 --> 16:44.920
there's more Puerto Rican
element around on the corners here lately.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.255
Slingin' dope?

16:46.463 --> 16:48.507
Whatever the hell it is they do out there.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.843
Pascal cousins do any dope slingin'?

16:51.927 --> 16:55.556
That stuff's a scourge
I don't allow on my premises, Andy.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.350
I'm not privy to what people do
on the outside.

16:58.475 --> 17:02.187
So that would be a "maybe"
as far as the Pascal slingin' dope.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.065
I'll tell ya, I'm sick about my car.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.985
You may get a decent settlement
from the insurance, Lenny.

17:08.402 --> 17:12.740
Well, luckily I am insured.
I better get the wheels turnin' on that.

17:13.198 --> 17:17.286
-All right, Lenny. Thanks for your help.
-We all swim in the same water.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.414
While you're paddlin' around there, Lenny,

17:20.581 --> 17:24.501
anything that comes to mind,
if maybe the Pascals got another cousin?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.087
There was a blood trail leavin' your car.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.090
You figure this wounded guy's still
on the loose?

17:30.340 --> 17:32.760
And he may have masterminded
the theft of your car.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.262
So we know you wanna see
him brought to justice.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.639
-Good point.
-Take care, Lenny.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.100
Hey, it's a pleasure meetin' ya, Danny.

-Hey, don't be glib.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.587
Lenny was involved.
He wasn't the go-to guy.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.339
Help me with the "go-to guy."

18:10.464 --> 18:12.716
He was like the scrounger
or the supply sergeant,

18:13.258 --> 18:15.761
-and maybe he set up the hit.
-What are you doin' there?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.930
-Feel like a tack caught in my shoe.

-I'm gonna ruin your comb.
-Yeah. There's a big loss.

-Yeah. Were you overseas?

-Giving it to you private.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.279
What? Is he playin' me for ambitious?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.782
He wants you goin' back
in that bar on your own

19:18.866 --> 19:22.452
either for him to dangle
some piece of information in front of you

19:22.619 --> 19:24.788
or to give you someone
to like for the hitters.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.790

won't be exactly right.

and enough you'll push it
for right altogether

off you coming up with the lead.

My only question,

20:08.207 --> 20:11.710
we ride all the way back together,
we're nearly in the boss' office,

20:12.252 --> 20:14.171
with you keeping this to yourself.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.425
Yeah. I was that long figuring
what's gonna give least offense.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.024
How's it going? Hey, Boss.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.278
-Rap sheet came in on Julio Diaz.
-The original shooting victim, thanks.

Yeah. Keep current with latent print.

Yeah, we'll run these names
the bystanders gave us through BCI.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.506
This Lenny Lohman went his usual
extra mile being helpful.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.634
-Gave you nothing?
-Yeah. He gave us this.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.844
He gives us the two dead guys names

21:03.053 --> 21:05.347
and speculates they might
have drug involvement,

21:06.306 --> 21:10.852
but then he goes to play Sorenson,
and Sorenson handled him good.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.688
Lohman gave me his card.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.482
Off thinking Sorenson's lookin'
out for number one,

21:15.649 --> 21:18.402
off thinkin' Sorenson's lookin'
to move himself up.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.279
Just played a wild guess.

21:23.240 --> 21:27.035
Lohman give Sorenson the card...
without my knowing about it.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.705
He gave it to him with my back turned.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.250
Sorenson told me about this on his own.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.962
I guess Lohman figures
he can beat me with somethin' lame.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.340
-It won't be all the way lame.
-No. Andy was sayin'.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.884
He'll give you some minnows
or somethin' to get you there.

with you going back there.

you got on canvas

22:04.114 --> 22:05.574
and what their acts are?

Hi, Sylvia. I was just in there

22:09.202 --> 22:11.455
working a complicated case
with my new partner.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.415
SYLVIA: That's your new partner?

22:13.540 --> 22:16.418
-Yeah, the 14-year-old.
-He looks very nice.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.962
Although, um,
he had to be in uniform a while.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.840
Two years in narcotics.
Now he tells me he was in the service.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.759
Probably not 14.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.059
Anyways, I didn't think
you were riding today.

-I wanted to talk to you.
-What'd I do?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.897

I might have done.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.775

to keep handwriting instruction optional.

about that prosecution, Andy.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.493
And I do recall your saying that
on several occasions since we met.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.371
-This isn't funny.
-I'm not making it funny.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.664
What does Suarez say?

22:56.833 --> 22:59.920
That he was a patsy
because he was the obvious suspect.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.714
-(SIGHS)
-He had sworn to kill Genero Lopez

23:02.798 --> 23:04.549
after Lopez killed his brother.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.719
How's the guy a patsy, Sylvia,
if he confessed he did it?

23:08.762 --> 23:11.431
What's new is,
Suarez isn't claiming anymore

23:11.556 --> 23:13.058
that his confession was coerced.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.268
He's saying the real shooter
was a drug dealer

23:15.644 --> 23:18.730
named Freddy Asuncion
who got him to say that he did it.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.065
Yeah...

23:21.108 --> 23:26.071
Suarez agreeing to help Freddy out
figuring in jail he'd learn a new trade?

23:26.571 --> 23:29.366
SYLVIA: Suarez agreed
because the drug dealer

23:29.533 --> 23:31.910
promised to give his family
a thousand dollars a month,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.538
and because he was probably
gonna be arrested anyway.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.040
All right, Sylvia, you know,
you can buy five of these stories

23:37.165 --> 23:40.210
-on every tier at Rikers.
-Andy, the victim was a dope slinger

23:40.293 --> 23:42.129
who had been involved
in three previous shootings.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.255
And what was Suarez?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.340
In his last year studying
for brain surgery?

23:45.465 --> 23:46.466
No.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.176
Suarez was an apprentice motor man

23:48.301 --> 23:51.096
who'd lost his job
because he took one collar for use.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.306
Jeez, I'm sorry I missed riding his train.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.642
And now he's afraid
that Ascencion's got someone inside

23:55.809 --> 23:57.394
who will try to kill him.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.729
-Aw, Sylvia.
-Suarez is doing 15 years,

23:59.855 --> 24:01.273
and I'm afraid that he isn't guilty.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.650
And now he might get killed.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.863
I'd just like for you
to talk to the detective, Dornan,

24:08.029 --> 24:11.158
who took the confession.
Just look into it that far.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.035
-The black guy who's now a sergeant?
-Are you friendly with him?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.079
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.039

24:18.623 --> 24:20.000
And you want me to ask Dornan what?

24:20.459 --> 24:23.086
Does he feel that he put
a wrong man in jail?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.089
None of the witnesses
describe the perpetrator

24:26.214 --> 24:28.258
as within four inches of Suarez' height.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.343
I'm not going to get into that
with him, Sylvia.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.304
SYLVIA: Then could you ask
if anyone mentioned

24:32.554 --> 24:33.555
Freddy Asuncion's name?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.765
No. That's accusing this guy
of incompetence,

24:35.849 --> 24:36.892
and I'm just not gonna do it.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.898
All right.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.196
(SIGHS) Maybe I can sidle into it.
Did Suarez give it up easy?

24:49.279 --> 24:51.406
Was that Dornan's impression
on how he confessed?

24:51.531 --> 24:52.949
Maybe I can go that far.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.119
-Could you do that?
-(SIGHS) Yeah, let me do that.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.874
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.918
He had a... a likability,

27:09.586 --> 27:11.921
but he also brooked no nonsense.

27:12.172 --> 27:16.426
Yeah. Well, I was glad enough
that Sorenson came up with that card.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.470
That he don't turn out no glory hound.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.557
I'm wondering what kind
of an interview he runs.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.808
You want to take a look?

27:24.225 --> 27:25.602
Well, if they're in a pokey room,

27:25.685 --> 27:27.937
we could, uh, we could watch
through observation.

27:28.104 --> 27:32.067
-You told me they were in the pokey room.
-Yeah. Then we could take a look.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.703
I mean, what's the progress here?

27:43.870 --> 27:48.208
I'm shot, I give you the list you ask for,
you sit staring like an owl.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.086
See, I got to figure the names
on your list

27:51.252 --> 27:53.046
are your chums from preschool, Julio,

27:53.254 --> 27:55.882
'cause not one of them shows up
on the list we got.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.676
Then you got a wrong list.

27:57.759 --> 28:01.096
Well, see, our list is buddies
that you've been collared with before,

28:01.846 --> 28:03.807
and I'm betting some of them
were in the street with you today.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.183
I was unaccompanied out there.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.478

and his cousin Vin shoot you,

in their beat-up gold Accord

28:10.897 --> 28:12.774

28:12.941 --> 28:14.943

if I'm sitting in the street

28:15.110 --> 28:16.736
with a shot-up shoulder, huh?

28:17.070 --> 28:18.530
-Name a bar you drink at.
-What?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.031

-I don't know. Lenny something.
-This Lenny's going to know you?

Yeah, he'll know me.
I don't think he'll say he loves me.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.680
Oh, that's hard to imagine.
Probably he don't know you that good.

help someone plant his flag
in a new situation,

I hope for a similar attitude.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.461
So you're going to help me plant my flag?

29:58.421 --> 30:02.258
This was drug-related.
This shooting you're investigating.

30:02.425 --> 30:03.468
It was?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.095
This was drug-related,
and I previously heard

30:06.221 --> 30:07.889
those Pascal cousins saying

30:08.014 --> 30:11.059
that they were having trouble
with both Julios.

-Both Julios?
-Both Julios. Correct.

for shooting the Pascals

in my stolen car.

30:30.954 --> 30:35.250
Lenny, you tell me a Puerto Rican
might have a friend named Julio

30:35.500 --> 30:37.627
and I'm supposed to make that cooperation?

30:37.961 --> 30:39.254
What I'm telling you, Danny,

30:39.379 --> 30:42.215
I specifically heard
the Pascals say something like that.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.593
And what I'm telling you, Lenny,
I think the Pascals didn't steal your car.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.762
I think you told them
where the spare key was,

30:47.887 --> 30:50.014
'cause maybe your ride
was a little bit dented up,

30:50.223 --> 30:52.934
and you wanted to collect blue book
from the insurance company,

30:53.059 --> 30:55.979

I don't need a ginger ale.

an anonymous call to my squad,

31:22.922 --> 31:26.676
ask for the next detective who's catching,
and tell her where to find this third guy,

31:26.843 --> 31:29.053
but don't tell her
he's connected with our case.

he'd been shot.

till three years later?

38:29.890 --> 38:33.185
Uh, I wish I could give you a better
sense on that, Sylvia...

38:33.602 --> 38:35.062

(CHUCKLES)

38:38.816 --> 38:40.318

SYLVIA: Okay.

38:51.954 --> 38:56.876
(SIGHS) I, uh, went around
with him on it, and, A,

38:57.626 --> 39:00.796
the guy just don't trust me that much,
and, B,

39:01.005 --> 39:05.051
even if he did, you got to understand
that, uh, cop's figure

39:05.551 --> 39:08.804
the small chance a guy didn't do something
on something he's locked up for,

39:08.888 --> 39:11.640
nine times out of ten
there's something else that he did do

39:11.849 --> 39:13.976
that he should've been locked up for
and he wasn't.

39:15.978 --> 39:18.647
You reopened the Coleman case
and worked to get him cleared.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.444
(CHUCKLES) I reopened the Coleman case
not out of no keen sense of justice,

39:23.736 --> 39:25.988
Sylvia, I did it
because I just stopped drinking

39:26.072 --> 39:28.908
and I was hypersensitive
and I... I didn't want nobody,

39:28.991 --> 39:33.329
even if they were skells,
thinking that I gave them a bum shake.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.169
(SIGHS)

39:41.879 --> 39:44.465
If you want me to, Sylvia,
I... I'll look into it further.

39:44.965 --> 39:47.134
I'm looking into it further
whether you do or not.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.345
Fine. Good. Two heads
are better than one.

your new partner?

40:23.295 --> 40:26.924
He, uh, he... he's got a lot on the ball.

-Russell, of course, has her reservations.
-Yeah, I expect she would.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.016
Yeah. These circumstances...

40:36.892 --> 40:40.229
with Bobby passing,
she'd have reservations

40:40.354 --> 40:42.773
him being replaced by Sherlock Holmes.

40:43.315 --> 40:47.069
Which, there's no need yet,
confusing this guy with him anyway.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.324
I'll tell you, though...

40:54.285 --> 40:56.745
certain traits remind me of Andy Jr.

40:57.663 --> 41:00.875
If he reminds you of Andy Jr.
he doesn't have to be Sherlock Holmes.

41:02.751 --> 41:06.964
Just some superficial traits, you know,
like, he gets this...

41:07.256 --> 41:10.718
this half-troublemaker grin,
it reminds me of him.

41:11.385 --> 41:15.514
(SIGHS) You want to know
if they're fundamental.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.736

41:59.934 --> 42:01.018
Good.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.771
Says him and the Pascals
were looking to hit this Julio Diaz

42:03.854 --> 42:07.233
-and another dealer named Rincon.
-What's the other dealer's first name?

42:07.775 --> 42:09.693
Why? Am I getting graded?

42:11.403 --> 42:12.780
No. It don't matter.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.492
Julio.

42:20.996 --> 42:23.582
(SIGHS) So at what point
do you get a locker in this squad?

42:23.832 --> 42:25.376
You'd want to take that up
with someone else.

42:27.044 --> 42:28.045
Anyways.

-Night, Diane.
-Yeah, good night, Danny.

I'm sorry for your loss.

You don't know anything about my loss.
