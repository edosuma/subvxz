00:01.653 --> 00:02.741
[male narrator]
Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:02.828 --> 00:03.742
[Zane]
Are you The Quiet One?

00:04.961 --> 00:06.223
We go there!

00:07.485 --> 00:08.573
kaboom

00:08.660 --> 00:10.706
Rain! It could slow our fall!

00:10.793 --> 00:12.316
[swooshing]

00:12.403 --> 00:13.622
[Lloyd]
We're on our own.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.625
[theme music]

00:34.295 --> 00:35.687
[thunder rumbling]

00:35.774 --> 00:37.907
[evil laugh]

00:41.432 --> 00:44.218
[male narrator]
Episode 80, The Quiet One.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.743
[dramatic music]

00:47.830 --> 00:49.788
[panting]

01:04.673 --> 01:06.544
- Ah!
- Come on!

01:07.545 --> 01:09.025
[growling]

01:10.200 --> 01:12.202
[screaming]

01:12.289 --> 01:13.986
thud

01:15.162 --> 01:17.860
[growling]

01:29.045 --> 01:30.002
Phew!

01:34.616 --> 01:37.401
- Ah.
- You okay?

01:37.488 --> 01:40.665
Yeah. Just, uh, need a second.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.885
- Ah!
- Let me see.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.412
- How is that?
- Oh! Um, good.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.893
Very close.
I-I-I mean, snuggly.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.374
I mean, snug.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.028
Are you sure
we're heading the right way?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.248
Pretty sure.
If this map is right

01:58.335 --> 02:01.077
there's a river that runs
through Primeval's Eye that way.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.079
And the river leads straight
to the hidden Oni Temple

02:03.166 --> 02:04.602
that holds the third mask.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.517
Uh, I don't know, Lloyd.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.476
Maybe it would be smarter
to turn back

02:08.563 --> 02:10.173
and try to find the others.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.697
I mean, your arm
is still pretty bad

02:12.784 --> 02:15.309
and we're all alone out here.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.701
I-I'm doin' okay.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.095
And anyway,
we can't take the chance.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.576
If the Sons of Garmadon
get to the mask first

02:21.663 --> 02:23.578
they'll have all three.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.581
Okay, but I want you
to rest that arm

02:26.668 --> 02:28.800
for a while
and let me take a turn.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.021
[grunting]

02:43.989 --> 02:46.905
[drill whirring]

02:54.783 --> 02:56.437
Any sign of Lloyd and Rumi?

02:56.524 --> 02:58.917
Negative. Should I gather
a search party?

02:59.004 --> 03:01.746
In this jungle, it's better
to stay with the Bounty.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.922
Let's get her mended
and the computer up and running

03:04.009 --> 03:06.708
so we can reestablish
our comm link.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.537
[Cole whistling]

03:09.624 --> 03:11.278
What you think
that baby's name is?

03:11.365 --> 03:13.236
You think he looks
like a Cole Junior?

03:16.587 --> 03:19.938
I think you should put
the baby down and help us out!

03:20.025 --> 03:21.940
Okay, Zane, give it another try.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.420
[static]

03:23.507 --> 03:25.553
Zane? Come in, Zane.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.816
Oh, great. Now the radios
aren't working.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.644
[growling]

03:31.559 --> 03:34.518
What do you think that was?

03:34.605 --> 03:36.564
Probably just some cute,
little critter.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.174
Or a big critter.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.915
A great, big, vicious critter

03:40.002 --> 03:42.265
with lots of teeth
and claws and pinchers!

03:42.352 --> 03:44.572
You can't tell all that
from how it sounds.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.964
Oh, yeah?

03:46.051 --> 03:49.316
If you listen real carefully..

03:49.403 --> 03:50.665
[static]

03:50.752 --> 03:52.101
[Zane]
'Did you guys say something?'

03:52.188 --> 03:54.408
[Jay]
'Any luck reaching Lloyd?'

03:54.495 --> 03:56.192
P.I.X.A.L. and I have only
been able to repair

03:56.279 --> 03:57.628
the shortwave comm link.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.500
It appears we won't be able
to find them

03:59.587 --> 04:02.851
until we get the Bounty
over these trees.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.288
- Ready to test the thrusters?
- 'Let's give it a go.'

04:05.375 --> 04:06.811
- 'Fire it up!'
- 'Go for it!'

04:06.898 --> 04:08.160
[rumbling]

04:08.248 --> 04:09.814
- Ha-ha! It's working!
- I'll say.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.599
Slow it down.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.165
Hey, cut it off!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.646
- Abort! Abort!
- Shut it down! Shut it down!

04:18.388 --> 04:20.999
Oh, that's it! I've had it!

04:21.086 --> 04:23.045
First, we crash land
in who knows where

04:23.132 --> 04:25.395
surrounded by who knows what
and now this!

04:25.482 --> 04:27.267
Well, at least
Cole Junior's fine.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.703
So we can give the diapers
to Jay.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.271
Ha-ha-ha! Hilarious!

04:31.358 --> 04:32.968
[gasping]
What was that?

04:34.622 --> 04:36.145
thud

04:36.232 --> 04:37.364
Look what I found.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.889
My suit! I mean, your suit.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.369
It's okay, P.I.X.A.L.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.198
It's yours now.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.810
There was also a note on it
from Lloyd.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.681
He and Rumi
are going to the temple.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.423
- Then they're okay.
- But we're still grounded.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.599
[Kai]
Let's get back to work

04:55.686 --> 04:57.775
before the Sons of Garmadon
pick up our trail.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.299
[static]

05:00.561 --> 05:02.824
[engines revving]

05:05.653 --> 05:09.526
The Bounty went down
just as The Quiet One planned.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.789
[tires screeching]

05:11.876 --> 05:14.314
Hm, this is gonna be fun!

05:14.401 --> 05:15.619
[laughs]

05:15.706 --> 05:17.926
Oh, it's just..

05:19.101 --> 05:20.320
What is it?

05:21.886 --> 05:23.279
What about the others who went?

05:23.366 --> 05:26.761
And the stories
about the sea monster?

05:31.983 --> 05:35.552
And what do you think The
Quiet One would do to you, hm?

05:35.639 --> 05:38.990
It will be worse than whatever
we find out there.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.079
I promise you.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.866
[intense music]

05:46.128 --> 05:48.043
[whooping]

05:57.966 --> 06:00.316
[grunting]

06:00.403 --> 06:02.187
Stuck in a palace all your life

06:02.274 --> 06:04.712
did you ever imagine
you'd be in a place like this?

06:04.799 --> 06:07.410
Hacking my way
through Primeval's Eye?

06:07.497 --> 06:08.977
Not so much.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.153
But to be perfectly honest

06:11.240 --> 06:13.024
I always dreamed being with you.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.116
[grunting]

06:20.728 --> 06:24.427
So according to this,
we're almost to the Black River.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.820
We just have to get past
this part

06:25.907 --> 06:28.126
'that reads "Strangler's Path."'

06:28.213 --> 06:32.348
[grunts]
Did you say Strangler's Path?

06:32.435 --> 06:35.569
That's cheery.
Why is it called that?

06:35.656 --> 06:37.919
Places like these
always have colorful names.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.529
Half the time,
it doesn't mean anything.

06:39.616 --> 06:40.878
The Caves of Despair

06:40.965 --> 06:43.054
Blind Man's Eye,
Hiroshi's Labyrinth.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.535
Probably just some bored
mapmaker with a wild..

06:45.622 --> 06:46.884
[screaming]

06:46.971 --> 06:49.670
- Lloyd!
- Rumi!

06:49.757 --> 06:52.150
[intense music]

06:56.024 --> 06:56.981
[grunts]

07:00.115 --> 07:02.073
[growling]

07:02.160 --> 07:04.075
You gotta be kidding me.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.078
[growls]

07:08.950 --> 07:10.604
I-it just, it tried to..

07:10.691 --> 07:11.735
Y-you just threw..

07:11.822 --> 07:13.345
How did the tree..

07:16.740 --> 07:18.699
Where did you learn
to throw a sword like that?

07:18.786 --> 07:20.570
Uh, I-I don't know.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.267
Uh, you were gonna be eaten.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.356
I-I-I got lucky, I guess.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.924
Luck? You were clear
over here..

07:31.320 --> 07:33.017
Should I not have done that?

07:33.104 --> 07:35.846
No, I-I mean, yes.
I mean..

07:35.933 --> 07:40.460
[sighs]
I guess now we know why
they call it Strangler's Path.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.378
- How's your arm?
- It feels alright now.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.207
[Zane]
Try now.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.732
No.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.863
And now?

07:53.951 --> 07:55.083
No.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.346
I detect frustration from you.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.914
Yet that emotion is not needed
for this task.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.307
- Is something wrong?
- No.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.787
Yes.

08:03.874 --> 08:07.269
Zane, may I ask you something?

08:07.356 --> 08:10.838
You have half my heart.
You can ask me anything.

08:10.925 --> 08:15.886
Was I more useful
inside the computer?

08:15.973 --> 08:17.758
What sort of question is that?

08:17.845 --> 08:19.934
You can be honest with me.

08:20.021 --> 08:23.851
Because I want to be
a useful member of the team.

08:23.938 --> 08:27.768
But I would prefer
not to return to the computer.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.031
I like having a body.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.294
But if you require
my assistance in your headset--

08:32.381 --> 08:34.818
The choice has always
been yours, P.I.X.A.L.

08:34.905 --> 08:38.039
And I, for one,
like seeing you like this.

08:39.693 --> 08:40.824
Good.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.569
- Now?
- Still no.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.745
[engines revving]

08:51.182 --> 08:54.708
- Why have we stopped?
- Because I don't fly.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.188
[dramatic music]

09:01.541 --> 09:04.282
Why fly when you have this?

09:07.372 --> 09:09.505
[laughing]

09:17.034 --> 09:19.428
[intense music]

09:39.753 --> 09:41.711
Now let's ride!

09:41.798 --> 09:44.192
[whooping]

09:53.984 --> 09:56.421
[hammering]

09:57.292 --> 09:58.467
[sighs]

10:02.732 --> 10:05.735
[grunts]
I wonder if Lloyd and Rumi
are okay?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.868
I'm sure they're fine.
They don't seem to have

10:07.955 --> 10:09.434
any trouble
lookin' out for each other.

10:09.521 --> 10:12.133
Yeah, I have noticed
they've gotten pretty close.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.787
- Pass wrench.
- Got the wrench?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.397
Wrench comin' your way.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.834
So Lloyd has the hots
for the princess.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.662
[chuckles]
If things keep heatin' up

10:19.749 --> 10:21.272
I wonder what we'll have
to call him next.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.623
The Royal Green Ninja? Pliers.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.147
- Got pliers?
- I don't have pliers.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.801
Oh, why, thank you.

10:27.888 --> 10:28.976
[gasps]

10:29.063 --> 10:31.631
[laughing]

10:31.718 --> 10:34.634
Cole...I thought you put
the baby down for a nap?

10:34.721 --> 10:35.939
[Cole]
'You mean, Little Cole Junior?'

10:36.026 --> 10:37.593
'I did,
but he was pretty restless.'

10:37.680 --> 10:39.769
Uh-huh, yeah,
then why is Little Cole Junior

10:39.856 --> 10:42.293
standing in front of me
and passing me the pliers?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.121
Uh..

10:44.208 --> 10:45.906
[laughing]

10:45.993 --> 10:48.778
Cole Junior is walking now!

10:48.865 --> 10:50.214
Uh, I don't know
much about babies

10:50.301 --> 10:51.868
but are babies supposed to walk?

10:51.955 --> 10:53.565
No! No, they're not.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.046
And I don't think
they know what pliers are.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.091
[grunts]

10:57.178 --> 10:58.919
Aah!

10:59.006 --> 11:00.703
And they definitely
can't do that.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.313
Okay, now I've seen it all!

11:02.400 --> 11:04.054
Now I really quit!

11:04.141 --> 11:06.927
Ha! Ninja never quit.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.624
[laughing]

11:08.711 --> 11:11.105
[dramatic music]

11:13.716 --> 11:18.199
[shudders]
Guys, I don't think
that's Cole Junior.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.679
[laughing]

11:19.766 --> 11:22.072
That's Master Wu.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.515
[Harumi grunting]

11:35.172 --> 11:36.478
[screams]

11:38.610 --> 11:40.830
The Sons of Garmadon insignia.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.574
[Harumi]
But what is it doing here?

11:50.622 --> 11:53.713
- Is anyone there?
- No. It's abandoned.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.370
The same map?

11:59.457 --> 12:02.809
I thought no one knew where
the only temple was located.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.072
So why are there two maps?

12:07.465 --> 12:09.424
The Quiet One
must have sent an expedition

12:09.511 --> 12:10.686
looking for the temple.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.993
It doesn't look like
they got very far.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.257
Yeah, but where did they go?

12:16.344 --> 12:18.650
What happened to them?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.740
Maybe we'll have better luck.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.919
[engine cranking]

12:30.401 --> 12:32.229
[both laughing]

12:32.316 --> 12:34.144
I'm beginning to think,
we are good luck together.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.204
5 feet. That's okay.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.381
A little left. More rocks.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.863
Not too fast.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.778
It's pretty shallow around here.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.736
That's good. Keep her steady.

13:03.391 --> 13:06.916
Do you think it's really
possible to bring someone back?

13:08.657 --> 13:10.964
I've seen a lot of things
in my lifetime.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.532
At first, I didn't.
Now not so sure.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.494
'Does any part of you
want to see your father again?'

13:24.586 --> 13:27.415
I had Ninjago's greatest villain
as my dad.

13:27.502 --> 13:31.288
It was an unusual relationship.

13:31.375 --> 13:35.336
But as much as we fought,
I still miss him.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.033
A little to the right.

13:41.124 --> 13:44.475
I would do anything
to see my parents again.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.216
I don't blame you.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.305
But if they bring
my father back

13:48.392 --> 13:50.699
the thing that scares me
the most is..

13:50.786 --> 13:52.962
He won't be the man
you recognize?

13:55.269 --> 13:56.966
He wasn't the greatest villain.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.838
Oh, no?
He probably grew up thinkin'

13:58.925 --> 14:01.144
it's Morro or the Devourer.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.278
- Don't tell me. Pythor.
- No.

14:04.365 --> 14:08.456
It's the one you never even knew
was there in the first place.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.763
- The one that gets away.
- The Quiet One.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.337
[Nya]
So he likes tea and he went
through a growth spurt.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.165
That doesn't mean he's Wu.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.473
Master...Wu!

14:27.301 --> 14:29.694
That's him, alright.

14:29.781 --> 14:33.307
But how did he get so young?

14:33.394 --> 14:36.484
[chuckles]
Who knows?
He's a living fortune cookie.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.226
Everything he does is a puzzle
meant to torture us.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.143
Maybe we'll never know.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.102
Don't you remember he was
touched by the Reversal Blade

14:46.189 --> 14:47.669
when he disappeared in time,
right?

14:47.756 --> 14:49.366
So?

14:49.453 --> 14:52.326
So what if the blade did more
than stop his aging?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.545
What if it somehow
made him younger?

14:54.632 --> 14:56.069
Like really young.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.766
[laughing]

14:57.853 --> 14:59.637
If your assumption is correct

14:59.724 --> 15:01.944
logic would dictate that he
would begin aging more rapidly

15:02.031 --> 15:03.511
once the effects of the blade
have worn off.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.340
So that explains how a baby can
learn to walk overnight.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.300
But how long until he's,
you know, back to good old Wu?

15:10.387 --> 15:12.607
I mean, no offence.
You look good for your age.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.304
[laughing]

15:14.391 --> 15:15.697
Time will tell.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.177
[whooping]

15:17.264 --> 15:19.962
[dramatic music]

15:26.926 --> 15:28.797
[laughs]
Yeah!

15:28.884 --> 15:31.452
And our time is running out.
How soon can we get out of here?

15:31.539 --> 15:33.541
Not soon enough.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.717
P.I.X.A.L., what are you doing?

15:35.804 --> 15:37.458
Slowing them down.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.503
[swoosh]

15:39.590 --> 15:40.809
She can handle herself.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
We need to get this ship
in the air.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.899
All hands on deck.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.206
[dramatic music]

15:46.293 --> 15:47.511
Let's go, Little Wu.

15:47.598 --> 15:48.773
You looked after us.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.211
It's only fair
we look after you.

15:51.298 --> 15:54.170

[evil laugh]

16:23.286 --> 16:24.592
[explosion]

16:27.247 --> 16:29.510
The timing of their arrival
is unfortunate.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.426
We've not yet had a fully
successful engine test.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.732
Fully successful?
It blew up in my face.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.430
Uh, in our faces.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.519
Let's not argue
over the details.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.480
[Lloyd]
No rocks. No rocks.

16:43.567 --> 16:48.485

16:55.362 --> 16:58.017
Stop the boat!

16:58.104 --> 16:59.888
There's definitely rocks
in the water.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.238
We need to find another...path.

17:04.719 --> 17:08.027
It's definitely not a rock.
We're not alone.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.506
[both scream]

17:09.593 --> 17:11.160
What was that?

17:11.247 --> 17:13.423
I'm thinking what the earlier
expedition ran into.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.208
Start the engine. Go! Go!

17:15.295 --> 17:17.906
[intense music]

17:17.993 --> 17:19.342
Hurry!

17:19.429 --> 17:21.823
[engine revving]

17:27.742 --> 17:29.004
What's in the water?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.788
Whatever it is,
it's gainin' on us.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.530
- Is this as fast as it can go?
- It won't go any faster.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.664
[screaming]

17:36.751 --> 17:38.361
We need to lighten the load!

17:49.590 --> 17:52.071

What do we do?

18:19.576 --> 18:22.057
- Why did it stop?
- I don't know.

18:22.144 --> 18:26.061
It's like something
kind of scared him off.

18:26.148 --> 18:29.195
- We have to get to shore.
- The current's pulling us away.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.457
What current?

18:30.544 --> 18:33.416
[intense music]

18:40.597 --> 18:43.209
- We need to go the other way.
- The other way?

18:43.296 --> 18:46.690
- That thing is back there.
- Reverse! Reverse!

18:46.777 --> 18:49.650
- It doesn't work.
- Grab on to something now!

18:54.655 --> 18:56.004
- Ooh!
- Grab!

- Seventy percent.

- Systems?
- She'll live.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.211
Get us in the air.
Wait, what about P.I.X.A.L.?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.822
I said it already.
She can take care of herself.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.696

'The trace program
the computer was running'

19:39.439 --> 19:41.745

The Quiet One's location

19:41.832 --> 19:43.486
it's finished.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.445
But that's odd.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.012
It says it originated
from the Bounty.

19:48.099 --> 19:51.581
- But that, that can't be.
- Yeah, that's impossible.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.889
The only one's on the ship
were us, P.I.X.A.L., and..

19:56.369 --> 19:58.806

if I were you.
