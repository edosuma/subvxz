01:02.000 --> 01:03.300
That lawyer you asked for...

01:04.300 --> 01:05.600
will be here shortly.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.100
Judge Toomey will see you now.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.300
Your Honor, I cannot make a case

01:36.700 --> 01:40.000
if Mr. Fiske refuses to participate
in the discovery process.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.700
My office has delivered
over 850,000 documents.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.600
Yes, but not the ones we requested.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.100
You've requested everything.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.300
And we haven't received it.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.500
Because everything takes time.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.000
Patty, Ray.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.500
I'm sick of you both.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.900
- Your Honor, I don't see...
- No, really, Ray, I am.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.200
You with the grandstanding
and the media attacks

01:58.300 --> 02:01.400
and the unrelenting tsunami of arcane

02:01.500 --> 02:03.100
and irrelevant motions.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.200
Stall tactics, Your Honor.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.900
He's trying to bog me down
in paperwork.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.000
No doubt.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.900
And I wouldn't mind, except that
I have to read them all, too.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.400
Your Honor,
every motion we've filed has merit...

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
Shut up.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.800
And you, Ms. Hewes, well...

02:16.300 --> 02:17.800
I guess I should be grateful to you.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.200
You don't waste my time
with unnecessary paperwork.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.200
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.200
But you...

02:23.100 --> 02:25.600
You present a far greater problem.

02:25.900 --> 02:26.800
Which is?

02:27.700 --> 02:30.300
Right about now, Ms. Hewes,
you don't seem to have a case.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.700
With respect, I disagree.

02:31.700 --> 02:32.700
I'll bet you do.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.100
But I'm afraid Mr. Fiske's motion
to dismiss is beginning to feel

02:37.200 --> 02:38.300
like it has some merit.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
Here's what's going to happen...

02:42.900 --> 02:45.400
you will cut the crap

02:45.400 --> 02:49.200
and give this lady every last shred
of discovery she is asking for.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.600
Certainly, Your Honor.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.500
And you, my dear,

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
by Friday...

02:54.700 --> 02:57.100
you will submit a brief
that lays out for me

02:57.500 --> 03:00.400
why in God's name I should not
dismiss your case.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.400
No problem, Your Honor.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.700
We've got a big problem.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.500
I need every attorney to contribute
on this brief.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.000
Andrew, you'll analyze the SEC filings.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.800
Felicia and Craig, Frobisher's personal
financial transactions.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.700
The "duty of care" argument
will be handled by

03:19.700 --> 03:21.600
Sean, Mike and Nelson.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.200
Ellen, help Sean's team.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.100
We're under the gun here.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.500
So nobody plan on going home.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.900
That's it, get to work.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Ellen, stay here for a second.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.000
Take a crack at summarizing
our application of the ERISA statute.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.400
Neither ran nor sleet

03:55.400 --> 03:57.200
nor cataracts and arthritis.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
Thank you, Pete.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Just get a...

04:00.600 --> 04:03.000
a draft on its feet and give it
to Sean Eckhart.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.900
He'll do whatever rewrite
is necessary.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.100
Oh, my God, it's going to
be a shitty week!

04:13.900 --> 04:15.200
Who would want to do this to you?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.500
How much time do you have?

05:03.700 --> 05:04.900
Sorry I didn't call you back.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.200
They evacuated our building.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.500
<i>I saw it on the news.</i>

05:08.500 --> 05:11.000
They shut down our office
so we moved to Patty's apartment,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.700
and now we have a brief to prepare,

05:12.700 --> 05:15.100
so she won't be able to meet
with you this week.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.200
Don't worry, I'll set something up
as soon as I can, I promise.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.900
Well, the sooner the better.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.800
The type of work you do is particularly
high-profile, Ms. Hewes.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.800
Maybe you could help us
by assembling a...

05:25.900 --> 05:27.200
You'd like a list of names.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.300
Anybody who may currently hold
a grudge against you.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.600
That's a long list.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.200
Do you have a lot of enemies?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
You could say that.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.700
Hey, are you still good for Friday
for the engagement party?

05:36.800 --> 05:37.700
They want a deposit.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.300
I'm going to have to check with Patty.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.700
Things are pretty crazy right now.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.700
OK, well, let me know.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.600
Listen, I got to go.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.300
I'm... I'm at the gym.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.900
I'll talk to you later.
Have a good workout.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.800
Am I correct,
you've been attacked in the past?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.000
Yes.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.100
Would you like to tell us
about that incident?

05:58.300 --> 06:01.300
It happened ten years ago.
I was slashed, I almost died.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.600
You think maybe next time
you could take this off?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.300
Actually, it's stuck.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.500
How ironic.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.700
His name is Gregory Malina,
and as far as I can tell, Katie told

06:29.700 --> 06:32.100
- the truth about how she met him.
- He was down in Florida?

06:32.700 --> 06:35.600
The same weekend she cooked
for Frobisher, that is 100% confirmed.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.700
Any ties to Frobisher?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.300
Not that I can tell.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.200
What about the bomb threat?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.700
Any ties to Frobisher on that?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.400
The feds are the feds.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.800
You're almost better off trying
to figure it out yourself.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
What is it, Tom?

06:56.600 --> 06:59.000
I know that this is not the best time,

06:59.400 --> 07:03.100
and I'm happy to do whatever
you need me to do right now, but...

07:04.600 --> 07:07.400
Following Katie Conner around...

07:08.100 --> 07:09.000
Yes?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.400
I'm a lawyer, Patty.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
I miss it.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.200
Be patient, Tom.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.800
Hi, Cory.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.300
Good boy.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.000
Hi, Collie. Could you take him out?
I'm sure he needs it.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.500
Cory, Cory, Cory, go on.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Ms. Hewes.

07:34.900 --> 07:35.800
May I help you?

07:35.900 --> 07:37.200
I'm here to help you, ma'am.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.500
I see you've met.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.700
A friend of yours?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.400
John Petroni, Patty Hewes.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.500
You've no reason to remember this,
we've actually met before.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.200
Forgive me, Mr. Petroni, where was that?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.700
The South Lawn of
the Clinton White House. Spring of '98.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.800
John is former Secret Service, Patty.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.200
He couldn't come
with a higher recommendation.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.800
It's an honor to see you again.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.900
It's very nice to see you as well.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.000
Secret Service? This is a bit much,
don't you think?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.700
Not after last time, no,
and this is not up for debate.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.400
This means what?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.900
You'll be accompanying me...

08:15.000 --> 08:15.900
Everywhere.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.400
I'm sorry about the troubles
at your office.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.000
This couldn't have come at a worse time.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.200
Thank you for being so understanding.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.800
I can't tell you how embarrassed
we are to be here again.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.500
In 30 years of adolescent education,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.799
I have learned that the best way
through these situations is candor.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.500
Mr. Lalas, we know that
you've gone above and beyond.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.900
If you have to expel Michael,

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
we won't fight it.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.100
I don't think we're there yet... quite.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.000
But we're close.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.700
This latest stunt was quite serious.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.000
We've confiscated Michael's computer.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.700
He used it to hack
into our school system.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.100
He accessed student records...

08:58.900 --> 09:01.600
Upcoming exams which he distributed
to the student body.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.700
Along with passwords to
our faculty's personal e-mail accounts.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.800
I'm sure you appreciate
the privacy issues involved.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.400
Michael made public
a lot of delicate information.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.800
Your son is very bright.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.600
I see enormous insight and potential.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.600
And there's a recent dream of his
that I find troubling.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.100
He told you a dream?

09:23.500 --> 09:26.200
I normally don't put a lot of weight
on adolescent dreams,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.100
but this one seems revelatory

09:28.200 --> 09:30.500
and he has given me permission
to relay it.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.900
In the dream,

09:33.500 --> 09:34.400
eight

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
black

09:35.500 --> 09:38.100
limousines pull up
in front of your apartment,

09:38.200 --> 09:41.300
and out of each one steps a Michael,

09:41.800 --> 09:43.700
who all look exactly alike.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.200
So much so, that even Michael can't tell

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
which one is the real him.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.000
But he knows that the other seven...

09:51.300 --> 09:52.500
are body doubles...

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
he has hired.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.300
Hired to do what?

09:55.700 --> 09:58.000
To prevent him from being assassinated.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.300
I see you've met my son.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
Yes, ma'am.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
Mikey.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.300
Come on, let's go home.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.900
Understand, Mr. Frobisher,
you're not being accused of anything.

10:22.900 --> 10:23.900
I appreciate that.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.300
And for the record,
I just want to say that I sympathize

10:27.300 --> 10:28.600
with the position you guys are in.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.900
As a party to this litigation,
I can understand

10:31.900 --> 10:33.800
why I'm in your crosshairs.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.100
Mr. Frobisher is too polite
to express his outrage

10:37.200 --> 10:39.400
at this intrusion into this life
and privacy.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.600
- Ray...
- My client had nothing to do with

10:41.700 --> 10:43.500
these threats against Patty Hewes,
and frankly,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.200
he's not required to answer
your questions.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.000
You could clear your name really quickly

10:47.000 --> 10:49.200
if you could just give us access to
your computer

10:49.200 --> 10:50.600
and your cell phone records.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.300
How about some probable cause?

10:54.300 --> 10:57.200
You show us a warrant and Mr. Frobisher
will be happy to comply.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.600
Ray, you give them whatever they need.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.300
I have nothing to hide.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.100
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, I got to take off.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.600
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.700
We will cooperate fully.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.700
Show you out.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.300
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:15.600 --> 11:17.300
Stall, you know, stonewall 'em.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.300
Be a lawyer.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.200
Art, you just promised...

11:20.200 --> 11:23.300
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let the feds
poke around in my personal life.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.500
Don't give them a goddamn thing.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.100
Hey, sweetheart,
I'm going to be a little late.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.200
My God, Ellen.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.100
Are you okay?

11:47.100 --> 11:48.100
What happened?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.300
If you needed a lawyer,

11:51.800 --> 11:53.100
why didn't you ask for Patty?

11:54.500 --> 11:55.900
Just get me out of here.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Morning.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.400
You're home early.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.200
36 hours.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.400
You made it.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.500
Did you get any sleep?

12:20.100 --> 12:23.800
I think I might have nodded off
during a catheter insertion, but...

12:24.400 --> 12:25.800
I can't really be sure.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.200
What about you?

12:28.700 --> 12:29.700
Couple hours.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.100
How's the brief coming?

12:34.400 --> 12:35.300
Great.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, it's fine.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.500
I have no idea.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.300
I'm gonna go with "great".

12:42.000 --> 12:43.900
Well, I hope I have it done in time,

12:43.900 --> 12:45.800
because Katie's invited everybody
for Friday.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.100
You put too much pressure on yourself.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.900
Look, I am fine rescheduling.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.300
When?

12:58.100 --> 13:00.700
You don't have a weekend off
for another two months.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.600
Besides, if we cancel Friday now,
my mother will have a nervous breakdown.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.300
We've collected prints and DNA
from the packing materials

13:13.300 --> 13:15.100
- and run them through our database.
- And?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.700
Unfortunately, there was no match.

13:16.900 --> 13:20.300
The device itself was an Army-issue
M67 fragmentation grenade.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.000
The serial number was filed off
so we can't trace the source,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.100
but we do know that it was sent
through the US mail,

13:25.400 --> 13:27.300
originating at a Midtown drop box.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.200
What you're saying is that
anybody can take a bomb,

13:29.300 --> 13:31.500
put it in a mailbox
and mail it to my wife.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.100
The device wasn't live, Mr. Grey.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.100
This time.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.400
Is someone trying to kill me or not?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.200
This type of threat usually has
one of two profiles.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.300
It may just be a warning.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
And the other profile?

13:42.600 --> 13:45.000
The threats will continue,
and they will escalate.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.500
<i>- I'll speak with you outside.
- Thank you.</i>

13:52.000 --> 13:54.300
Now, a lot of you are probably aware

13:54.300 --> 13:56.400
of the fact that
after yesterday's events,

13:56.900 --> 13:59.600
six of your coworkers
took personal days...

13:59.900 --> 14:00.800
and I fired them.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
All of you

14:03.600 --> 14:06.000
are members of an extraordinary team,

14:06.700 --> 14:09.000
and I value each and every one of you.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.900
If you want to quit,

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
just tell me now.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.500
But if you call in sick

14:14.600 --> 14:17.000
thursday or friday,
don't bother coming in Monday.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.800
Your jobs won't be waiting for you.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
That grenade

14:20.800 --> 14:22.900
was never meant to destroy our office.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.700
It was meant to destroy our resolve.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.900
We have two days left
to show Judge Toomey

14:28.900 --> 14:30.500
that there's a case to litigate here.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.800
Frobisher's former employees lost
everything.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.800
Right now, we are their only hope
for restitution.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.100
And nothing...

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
nothing...

14:39.900 --> 14:41.100
is going to keep us

14:41.200 --> 14:45.200
from getting a clear and powerful
opposition brief to the court.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.500
Back to work.

14:51.700 --> 14:54.300
Ms. Hewes,
Sean's not returning my e-mails.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.300
I fired him.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.600
Get your section to me.
I'll rewrite it for the brief.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.500
You know what we should do?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.100
We should box up a couple of these,
send 'em over to Patty's,

15:03.700 --> 15:05.500
watch the bomb dogs go nuts.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.300
Get me the relish, will you?

15:08.300 --> 15:09.600
What were you were saying?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.300
Arthur, I can keep those agents at bay,

15:13.400 --> 15:15.300
and I'm not pointing fingers here,

15:15.300 --> 15:17.700
but if there's something
that you've done...

15:21.700 --> 15:23.400
Why would I do anything, Ray?

15:23.900 --> 15:27.900
Because the brief Patty has to write
to save her case is due Friday

15:28.300 --> 15:31.600
and all this pandemonium is hardly
helping her concentration any.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
You think?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.100
That better not be a confession, Art.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
Guess how much it costs to send

15:47.100 --> 15:48.800
a hand grenade through the mail.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.100
Don't say another word.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.300
Does your wife ever just want
to reach over there

15:58.400 --> 16:00.500
and pinch your cheeks
'cause you're so adorable?

16:01.800 --> 16:02.700
No.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.700
You should go outside and get some sun,
Ray. You look like crap.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.200
- Hi. I'm Ellen Parsons.
- Good morning.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.800
I need to talk to Patty.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.500
I'm not sure what the procedure is.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.400
Knock.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
We'll see what happens.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.800
- Hi. Walk with me.
- Hi.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.300
Ms. Hewes,
I don't know if you got my e-mail.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.700
About your engagement party?

16:35.700 --> 16:38.100
I know it's bad timing...
it's just the only night my fiance

16:38.100 --> 16:40.400
- and I can make it work is friday.
- This friday?

16:40.400 --> 16:43.900
I know, I know, the brief is due, and
my section will be done well in advance.

16:43.900 --> 16:44.900
I promise.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.800
Well, then, by all means,
enjoy your party.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.100
Thank you, Ms. Hewes.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.400
Ellen, you're an adult.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.000
You do your work, your life's your own.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
And Ellen, call Katie.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
I wanna get a meeting on the books.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
Sure.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.500
You got something against hotels?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
No.

17:07.700 --> 17:11.099
It's just that we never seem
to finish our conversation.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.500
So let's talk.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.099
You were good to me after Florida.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.400
You did the right thing.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.200
I was half responsible.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.700
Still, we hardly knew each other
and you helped me through it,

17:23.700 --> 17:25.500
which you didn't have to do.
I was grateful.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.800
So why'd you stop calling me?

17:28.900 --> 17:30.100
I was kind of...

17:30.200 --> 17:31.500
Confused back then.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.900
Have you been following
the Frobisher case?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.400
Arthur Frobisher? Sure, on the news.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.100
Do you remember that we actually saw him
down in Florida?

17:39.300 --> 17:41.500
Vaguely. Didn't you cater
some event for him?

17:41.500 --> 17:43.900
Yeah... He helped set me up
in a restaurant,

17:43.900 --> 17:46.300
and now I'm being asked
to be a witness against him.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
Do you know anything?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.500
I don't know yet, but...

17:51.100 --> 17:53.400
I saw him several times
that weekend and the lawyer

17:53.400 --> 17:56.300
thinks that maybe I can contradict
his testimony.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.500
You're kidding.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.700
No, I wish I was.

17:58.900 --> 17:59.800
Look, I...

18:00.000 --> 18:01.900
I had to tell her about us.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.500
I had to account for my time,
time down in Florida.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.200
I didn't tell them
your last name, I didn't...

18:07.200 --> 18:09.100
- It's okay.
- to get you in the shit like I was.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.300
It's okay.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.800
It's okay. Thank you.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.000
Maybe, if you do know something,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.700
you should come down and
speak to the lawyers with me.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.300
No, I don't.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.700
You know, the only time
I saw Frobisher was with you.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.100
Look, I'm sorry you're going
through all this.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.200
If there's anything I can do, okay?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.900
Hey, if you need anything...

18:37.600 --> 18:38.700
Okay.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.900
First off, want to applaud
the three of you for being here.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.300
Family dynamics aren't easy
to talk about, and just your presence

18:45.300 --> 18:47.900
in this room is cause for optimism that,

18:47.900 --> 18:51.500
together, we will be able to get to
the source of what's troubling Michael.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.800
- That's our goal as well.
- Great.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.800
Just so I can understand
some basics here...

18:56.800 --> 18:59.300
Mr. Grey, you're Michael's
step father, is that right?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.600
Yes. We've been living together
as a family for 12 years now.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.200
Phil is my father, Dr. Herschenfeld.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
I see.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.800
Well, then, as Michael's parents,
I'd like to hear from you,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
why you think we're here today.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.700
Well, I think we're here today because

19:18.000 --> 19:20.700
Michael has manipulated you people

19:20.700 --> 19:23.300
into thinking he deserves yet
another chance.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.200
No. That's okay.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.100
Go on, Ms. Hewes.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.600
No, there's no more.
I was finished.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.600
Having spoken with Michael, I have
to say, as a therapist and educator,

19:36.800 --> 19:41.100
my immediate concern is a recent dream
of his regarding his mortality.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
And my paralyzing fear of death.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
Right.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.500
Are you familiar with the dream?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.400
Oh, yes, we are.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.600
It's not Michael's.

19:52.200 --> 19:52.900
No?

19:53.200 --> 19:53.900
No.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.800
Michael heard that from somebody else.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.100
Come in.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.500
Are you gonna be here all night?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.600
It looks like it.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.900
How's it going?

20:18.100 --> 20:19.100
Great.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.500
I think I'm gonna finish it early.
I know how hectic it's been for you.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.200
Ellen, I don't give out
awards for beating deadlines.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.900
Make sure you're putting
your best foot forward.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.100
I will.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.900
I always liked this office.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.300
You're lucky... no distractions.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.900
You have your work and you do it.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.200
How are you holding up?

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
Fine.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.800
Fine.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.900
It turns out my son isn't
gonna be expelled after all.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.200
That's great news.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.300
Yeah, great.

20:59.700 --> 21:00.700
New pictures?

21:01.800 --> 21:02.800
Oh, yes. Sorry.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.500
I know you don't like personal
stuff around the office.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.200
Who told you that?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
Tom.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.300
Tom.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.700
Always speaking out of turn.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.800
I wonder how he is.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.700
Can I see them?

21:20.300 --> 21:21.900
Sure. It's just my family.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.500
Let me see.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.200
I like that family's important to you.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.200
When did you say
your engagement party is?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.900
Friday night.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.100
Soon.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.100
Very.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.400
So.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.200
That's exciting.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
Yeah.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.000
Those bookends are hideous.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.100
Take them home.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.700
Hello?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.200
<i>- Did I wake you?
- That's okay.</i>

22:19.900 --> 22:21.600
<i>Are y... are you still working?</i>

22:21.600 --> 22:23.100
Do you think I should invite Patty?

22:23.100 --> 22:24.200
<i>Where?</i>

22:24.200 --> 22:25.800
To the engagement party.

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
I don't know.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.800
She was hanging around my office.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.500
I think maybe she wants to be invited.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
<i>Really?</i>

22:35.300 --> 22:37.100
Do you think it's rude not to?

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
I don't know.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.500
Do you have to invite her bodyguard?

22:44.100 --> 22:45.900
I'll just give her the address.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.800
<i>- Right?
- Okay.</i>

22:48.800 --> 22:50.900
<i>All right. Just come home.</i>

22:53.400 --> 22:54.400
Come in!

22:57.400 --> 22:58.800
Sorry to bother you.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.700
If you're free, we'd love you
to come Friday night.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.100
Or not.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.900
If you can't.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.400
It's a lovely thought. Now close
the door, I've got work to do.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.300
Sure.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Can't sleep?

23:46.900 --> 23:48.000
I'm sorry.

23:48.700 --> 23:49.800
Go back to bed.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.000
You know I can't sleep without you.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
The guard has changed
shift in the lobby.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.300
The door's locked.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.900
Michael is sound asleep...

24:09.300 --> 24:10.400
and you are safe.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.700
I'll never be safe.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.600
You can't let yourself think that way.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.200
Morning, Ms. Hewes.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.800
Here's the brief.
There's an index...

24:36.800 --> 24:38.200
And good morning to you.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.700
You stay all night?

24:39.900 --> 24:40.900
Yeah.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.700
You have more time if you need it.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.100
No, I'm good, thank you.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.200
We'll see about that.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Thank you.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.500
And how's your morning?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.500
Every day above ground
is a Pyrrhic victory.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.200
How about yourself?

24:55.900 --> 24:59.700
I let it get to me last night,
Pete, but today's another day.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.100
That's my girl.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.500
Thank you. Morning.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.800
Got so much work to do.
Did you get this taken care of?

25:07.200 --> 25:11.700
My guy petioned the hard drive,
indexed the content, then ran a purge.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.100
Which means?

25:13.200 --> 25:14.700
It's been wiped clean.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.000
Here's a list of what
Michael had in there.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.100
What's a M-I-L-F?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.000
I have no idea.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.800
Michael also enjoyed SororitySluts. com,

25:25.800 --> 25:29.600
JugBangers. net and Cornhole Capers.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.700
Stop it.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.500
Hell, Patty,
it's just teenage curiosity.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.700
Miss Hewes, your limo's waiting.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
So he works for a consulting firm.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.600
Yeah, but back when
he met Katie in Florida,

25:43.900 --> 25:46.200
he was waiting tables
in the West Village.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.100
That's an interesting career path.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.400
The thing is, Frobisher has had
no dealings with Gregory's firm.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.600
I can't find a link between these guys.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.100
Gregory wears a wedding ring.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.200
So it's possible that Katie's just
lying to hide their affair.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.600
- Why not subpoena him?
- No...

26:06.100 --> 26:07.900
we're gonna wait until
we know what's there.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.500
Oh, Tom,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.900
could you see if there's anything
we can use in this? If not, rewrite it.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.700
- Who wrote it?
- Ellen.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.000
What's the problem?
I thought you wanted some legal work.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.300
Do you think rewriting a first-year's
draft is what I had in mind?

26:32.600 --> 26:33.700
Come in.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.300
Just...

26:36.500 --> 26:37.600
checking on you.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.500
Thought, you can use this.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.200
Sure.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.500
If someone really wanted
to kill me,

26:52.900 --> 26:54.000
be honest,

26:55.600 --> 26:57.800
there's not a damn thing
you could do about it, is there?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.900
No one's going to touch you, Miss Hewes.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.100
Not on my watch.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.300
You know, ever since I was little,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.200
I've always thought I'd die violently.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.400
This, man who attacked you,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.100
who was he?

27:17.800 --> 27:21.500
He was a former CEO.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.500
At trial, he lost everything.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.000
I came out of the courthouse so

27:30.400 --> 27:32.300
pleased to have won...

27:33.700 --> 27:35.200
I didn't see him coming.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.300
I learned something, now.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.500
What's that?

27:41.300 --> 27:44.400
Taking power away from
a man is a dangerous thing.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.100
Someone always pays.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.700
Evening, Mr. Grey.

28:04.700 --> 28:05.900
Evening, Jorge.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.100
Thank you.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.300
Jorge, the seat.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.600
You have to put the seat
back after you've driven.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.000
I've got long legs, okay?

29:10.900 --> 29:12.300
Mr. Grey!

29:16.700 --> 29:19.100
He's gonna be fine. We're gonna
take him in, run a few tests.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.600
Just make sure everything's okay.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.900
His head hit the windshield
after the scare.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.400
What scare?

29:29.600 --> 29:32.300
I was reaching for my glasses
in the glove compartment.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.900
There was another grenade.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.900
I'm so sorry.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.000
Hell of a night, huh?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.500
I'm glad Phil's okay.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.000
Thank you, Tom.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.600
Do you have Ellen's draft for me?

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Yeah.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.900
Although,

30:21.900 --> 30:23.200
there's nothing I could do.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.600
It's that bad?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.100
No. Besides a formatting error,

30:28.300 --> 30:29.600
it's perfect.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.700
How's Ellen doing?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.700
She's a little naive,

30:37.700 --> 30:39.500
works hard, but...

30:42.100 --> 30:43.300
But what?

30:45.200 --> 30:46.700
I question her priorities.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.700
This is great work.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.400
Thank you.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.700
We've assembled the brief.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.000
I want you to personally submit
the chambers copy to Judge Toomey.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.000
I want him to put a face to your name.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.000
You'll be making a first impression that
could serve us well if we go to trial.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.700
Thank you, Miss Hewes.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.800
Don't thank me, Ellen. You earned it.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.400
I want the man to know who you are.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.900
Heading out?

31:28.900 --> 31:30.300
Delivering the brief to Toomey.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.600
- No shit?
- Yeah.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.100
Hope you cleared a few hours.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.500
No, I'm just handing it in.
Then I have my engagement party.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.500
Toomey will keep you waiting all night.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.800
He's notorious for it.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.000
<i>Patty, my guy did some
research on that Web site.</i>

31:44.600 --> 31:45.500
What is it, Pete?

31:45.500 --> 31:48.100
<i>I think you're gonna want
to see for yourself.</i>

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
Hi. Ellen Parsons for Judge Toomey.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.200
Regarding...?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.800
I'm delivering the opposition
brief in the Frobisher case.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.600
You can just leave it with me.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.700
Miss Hewes asked me
to deliver it personally.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Suit yourself.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
The Judge is holding a settlement
conference. It'll be a while.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.300
Water?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.300
I'm fine, thanks.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.100
Why didn't your bodyguard come in?

32:34.100 --> 32:36.800
You gonna risk your life
for a bowl of ziti?

32:37.800 --> 32:40.900
I told Mr. Petroni that
I wanted to talk to you alone.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.800
More like yell at me alone.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.500
Why did you tell my dream
to everyone at school?

32:50.700 --> 32:52.500
You saw.
They thought it was cool.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.400
It's not yours.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.400
So?

32:56.800 --> 32:57.900
So,

32:58.600 --> 33:00.300
you lied to everyone.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.000
Yeah. What's your point?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.500
Thank you.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.200
Could we have some water, please?

33:12.700 --> 33:15.000
I am not accusing you.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.100
I am just confused.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.900
I am trying to understand you.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.300
Okay.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.800
If you're angry with me,
why don't you just tell me?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.200
Angry. I don't even know
what you're talking about.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.200
Yes, you do.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.400
If you say so.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.100
Hey, everybody wants to know
when you're gonna get here.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.000
I have no idea.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.700
I should probably just leave
the brief with the receptionist.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.300
You said it's a big deal
to meet the judge, right?

33:53.300 --> 33:55.000
Yeah, but is it more important than...?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.300
Look, I can keep your family
occupied for a while longer, but

33:59.400 --> 34:01.100
the decision's yours.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.800
Do you think you

34:07.600 --> 34:09.100
might be depressed?

34:09.300 --> 34:10.300
No.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.900
I think I'm tired.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.000
That's just 'cause I purposely
stay up too late.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.300
You stay up too late on purpose?

34:17.800 --> 34:20.900
I want to feel tired
so that I can feel stupid.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.699
Michael, I don't understand
why you would want to feel stupid.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.100
Because I'm scared.

34:29.699 --> 34:30.699
Of what?

34:31.100 --> 34:32.400
Of being smarter than you.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.100
I'm afraid you're gonna realize it.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.199
Stop playing games.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.900
Fine, I won't explain.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.400
All right, okay, okay.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.300
Go ahead, explain.

34:46.900 --> 34:50.300
When I make you angry
or I make you laugh,

34:50.699 --> 34:52.800
I do it because of controlling you.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.900
So you enjoy manipulating me?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
No, God, no.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.600
It's way too easy.
I don't enjoy it.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.900
I feel sorry for you.
You make me sad.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.100
I don't believe you.

35:07.700 --> 35:08.700
I think

35:09.400 --> 35:10.700
you resent me,

35:11.500 --> 35:13.100
you resent my work.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.500
You have every right to,

35:15.900 --> 35:18.600
but that doesn't justify your behavior.

35:20.700 --> 35:21.700
What behavior?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.500
It has to stop, Michael.

35:24.700 --> 35:25.800
What has to stop?

35:28.200 --> 35:30.000
It has to stop now.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.500
Do you understand me?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.500
We done?

35:43.300 --> 35:44.400
I guess so.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.200
How're you doing, man?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.200
- Sure.
- Spare a cigarette?

36:11.100 --> 36:12.500
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.100
Thanks. Appreciate it.

36:19.900 --> 36:21.200
Got a light?

36:29.500 --> 36:31.100
Mom! Mom!

36:36.800 --> 36:38.100
Holy Christ!

36:49.600 --> 36:51.700
If you change your mind,
just leave that on my desk.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.900
I'm off to karaoke.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.600
I should probably stay.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.600
You know, it's just a brief.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.700
Attorneys leave them
with me all the time.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.300
The first step to discipline
is control through fear.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.800
The first seven days,

37:09.800 --> 37:12.600
your son is allowed absolutely
no contact with the outside world.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.000
- How about the Internet?
- Nothing.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.400
Good.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.100
Who the hell knew

37:26.200 --> 37:29.200
that a 17-year-old could
buy a grenade online?

37:31.700 --> 37:33.200
Ma'am, you did the right thing.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.700
Oh, I forgot about you.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.100
True to form, the Judge
was running three hours late.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.300
<i>Really?</i>

37:49.500 --> 37:51.600
Ellen was still there
when I left at 9:15.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.300
That's an interesting choice.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.800
Thanks, Delia.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.600
Miss Parsons?

38:11.900 --> 38:12.900
Yes.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.700
Patty insisted I damn well better make
it a point to meet you.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.100
It's a pleasure, your Honor.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.800
Patty says you're the best
and the brightest

38:19.800 --> 38:21.700
and she's not one for hyperbole.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.200
You got time for a chat?

38:24.200 --> 38:25.400
Sure,

38:25.800 --> 38:27.700
sir. Yes, definitely.

38:29.700 --> 38:32.600
You are one of the lucky ones
coming up under Patty Hewes.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.600
She cut the shit and come clean?

38:43.600 --> 38:45.900
Still swears she didn't kill her fiance.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.000
Well, technically, she didn't.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.200
- What do you mean?
- He wasn't her fiancé.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.200
We canvassed the building.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.900
The neighbors said they had
a hell of a beef and she walked out.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.700
Really?

39:00.600 --> 39:02.400
The engagement was called off.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.900
Sounds like he really liked you.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.200
You're the best, huh?

39:13.300 --> 39:14.700
And the brightest.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.900
Was it worth it?

39:21.900 --> 39:22.900
I don't know.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.700
Depends.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.300
How pissed is my family?

39:30.100 --> 39:31.200
You know your dad.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.300
I'll make it up to them.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.000
I'll make it up to them at the wedding.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.700
I didn't kill David.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.000
Someone tried to kill me.
