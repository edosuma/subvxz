WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.343
Newcastle, done. Cancun, done.

00:11.244 --> 00:14.047
Australia, guess what?
You're getting done.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.983
The Geordies are going down under.
To Australia.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.986
And deep into the bush.
Look out!

00:21.921 --> 00:24.324
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.527
This is gonna be the best one yet.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.598
This is a fucking war.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.201
I'm taking the singles away
on the best trip ever.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.542
Oh, I had a dream that, like,
I sucked Scotty T off.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.878
No, that was reality.
I sucked him off.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.182
I don't know who the fuck he thinks
he is, but he can't go on like this.

00:49.249 --> 00:53.887
I'll be here for you no matter what
and it has been hard.

00:53.953 --> 00:57.690
No matter how much I hate him, no
matter how nasty I've been about him

00:57.757 --> 01:00.026
I can't let him sit up there
by himself.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.797
Not gonna let you back in yet, mate.
Violence doesn't solve anything.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.965
I don't know where
the others have gone.

01:06.032 --> 01:09.402
I hope that they're not having fun.
Gary was in the wrong too

01:09.469 --> 01:13.106
and why should he get treated
for his behaviour?

01:13.173 --> 01:17.076
The minute I see Dan
I know that I do like him.

01:17.143 --> 01:20.380
Our night is dedicated to
getting Holly home and in bed.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.249
This singles trip
was not meant to be like this.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.585
(screaming)

01:27.320 --> 01:29.489
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.758
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.160
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:34.227 --> 01:35.962
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.897
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.567
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.802
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.371
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:54.147 --> 01:56.616
This is one of
the most beautiful places.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.986
Not only was Holly smashed
last night, I got in trouble.

02:00.053 --> 02:03.656
Sheep Steve is gonna go mental.
It's me last night before Sydney.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.426
I'm gonna make the most of it.
Whitsunday Islands.

02:13.399 --> 02:16.903
It's the morning after
and everything is forgotten.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.004
We're in paradise.

02:18.071 --> 02:22.075
How can you not have a good time
and enjoy yourself when you're here?

02:33.253 --> 02:37.757
Whenever I've kicked off, right,
I don't remember it. Yeah.

02:37.824 --> 02:42.295
I'm already in that stage where
me mind just blocks everything out.

02:42.362 --> 02:47.967
Well, tonight no shots, right?
And just sip at two drinks.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.969
Tonight I'm not gonna drink.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.906
I'm gonna help out Holly
and for her sake stay sober.

02:52.972 --> 02:56.309
I don't want it to keep
happening to spoil your time.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.378
It is just the alcohol.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.780
I must be such a burden
on a night out.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.249
They shouldn't have to put up
with my anger.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.585
I don't know where it comes from.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.054
They have to look after me
and it's not right.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.563
Oh, God, sheep.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.966
Last night was amazing.
We had so much fun.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.770
We walked into that club and we're
not bothered about anything else

03:23.836 --> 03:25.772
but having fun with each other.

03:25.838 --> 03:29.375
I hate them. Look at the way they're
staring at us. Scary animals.

03:29.442 --> 03:34.013
Me and Charlotte are going to work.
I want to tell Steve what happened.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.982
Hi, Steve. How are you?

03:36.049 --> 03:40.019
I've been waiting for ya.
That one looks like it's got piles.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.622
That's gotta come off them.
Clean 'em up.

03:42.689 --> 03:46.492
I've got it in my head I can show
Steve that I can be good at one job.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.096
I'm in the cage, I've got the sheep,
I'm ready to do the job.

03:51.631 --> 03:55.168
Oh, me God, one's pooed on me leg,
one's pooed on me leg.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.370
Oh, my God,
you've got shit on your leg.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.772
But the sheep just freak us out.

03:59.839 --> 04:04.377
Where's James?
James? He's in the shit, ain't he?

04:04.444 --> 04:07.847
Youse can elaborate a bit more
about all this stuff going on.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.417
We need to tell Steve that the fight
wasn't just James's fault.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.019
It was Gary instigating it.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.188
Gary wanted James to go,

04:15.254 --> 04:19.158
and he knows that you would be angry
if James hit him.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.894
So he provoked it,
Gary provoked the attack.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.464
Gary knew exactly what he was doing.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.533
He knew that if he pushed James
hard enough,

04:27.600 --> 04:32.538
James would end up hitting him, which
leads to James getting kicked out.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.575
What's gonna happen?
Are you gonna get this sorted?

04:35.642 --> 04:37.543
He's not going back into the house.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.879
I think Steve is taking Gary's side

04:39.946 --> 04:42.448
when really he should be
taking James's side.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.450
Yeah, Barry!

04:44.517 --> 04:48.321
This day is not going very well
at all.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.294
This place is absolutely amazing.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.864
I've planned a boat trip
and snorkelling.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.933
I hope everyone enjoys it.
This is a chance of a lifetime.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.246
I feel like I'm having so much fun
with Gaz and Scott.

05:13.312 --> 05:16.616
I feel like we've all got
such a bond now. Yeah, we have.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.585
This holiday has made me realise
that I do love them

05:19.652 --> 05:22.789
and they are like my brothers
and they can have fun with us.

05:22.855 --> 05:27.326
I'm in a place now where I'm finally
comfortable with meself. Good.

05:27.393 --> 05:31.964
I quite like Dan. I think gonna
see him once more before I leave.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.333
Are you?
I reckon we should go to dinner

05:34.400 --> 05:37.804
and meet youse out after,
maybe Tuesday night when I'm back.

05:37.870 --> 05:38.971
Yeah, do it.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.374
I've started to develop feelings
for Dan

05:41.441 --> 05:44.844
that go a little bit beyond
just wanting to tash on with him.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.747
I'm not gonna feel OK
tashing on with other people.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.851
They're so cute together,
aren't they?

05:51.918 --> 05:53.920
A little couple.
Such a nice couple.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.589
Gary, you swim like a merman
as well.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.269
Do you? Why don't you just wait
and we'll do it together.

06:10.336 --> 06:13.773
I am absolutely livid
about this crack.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.175
Charlotte and Joel
are going shark diving

06:16.242 --> 06:20.613
and I've got asthma and can't do it.
I'm fucking fuming. Fucking asthma.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.184
I'm glad you're coming, Soph.
I'm glad I'm coming too.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.588
Well, this is a bit awkward.
If you two want to have a domestic

06:28.654 --> 06:32.458
while I'm sitting in the middle of
you. Don't anyone worry about me.

06:32.525 --> 06:36.562
If it was the other way around,
I wouldn't stop you from doing it.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.665
I know that for sure.
I'd be happy for you.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.168
I'd be like, "Go for it,
it's gonna be wicked."

06:42.235 --> 06:44.604
I'm happy for you.
Why you being so moody?

06:44.670 --> 06:48.174
Joel came here to Australia
to be with me

06:48.241 --> 06:50.109
and to be with me every second.

07:02.455 --> 07:05.224
I'm in the training tank
and this feels amazing.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.268
I hate him.
I'm never gonna speak to him again.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.977
I don't know what's got into Sophie.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.146
Can she not let us have
this one thing?

07:27.213 --> 07:29.215
She's pissing all over me parade.

07:31.083 --> 07:35.254
The excitement is back, there's
big fish, little fish, starfish,

07:35.321 --> 07:38.157
stingrays... Whoa, there's a shark!
Oh, my God!

07:43.930 --> 07:46.299
I'm not gonna be a girl who is upset

07:46.365 --> 07:48.768
and that if me boyfriend
asks us if I'm OK,

07:48.835 --> 07:52.038
"Yeah, I'm fine,"
because I'm not fine.

08:04.350 --> 08:06.686
I don't think girls
are arsed about pulling.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.287
Because it's a singles trip,

08:08.354 --> 08:11.090
they're giving us no hassle,
they're helping wuh.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.107
So, when I go out, tash on with
a couple lads in a couple weeks,

08:28.174 --> 08:31.777
I've gotta watch myself, I'm in
danger of getting called the S-word.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.481
When Gary and Scott do it,
they're ultimate lads.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.587
I see this wicked bird in the club
and I'm thinking

08:41.654 --> 08:44.190
I'm gonna take her back
and do some acrobatics.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.602
I'm pleased the lads have pulled.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.539
If they'd came home from this trip
and not bucked anything,

09:00.606 --> 09:02.909
can you imagine the shame
they'd have felt?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.054
Go for it, get out.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.991
Go put that parsnip and pipe
to good use.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.228
We get back to the apartment.
I'm buzzing.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.730
Scott's banging one,
I'm banging the other.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.868
This is the perfect, perfect end
to this trip. Whitsunday's done.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.672
Scott's got four girls round him
like he's Hugh Hefner.

09:34.607 --> 09:38.244
I don't know what he think I'm gonna
dee, I've lost me motor skills.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.648
Steve's telling me that
I'm getting kicked out. Fuck off.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.117
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

09:46.986 --> 09:47.186
.

09:49.722 --> 09:49.922
.,

10:00.232 --> 10:01.367
Last night was mint.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.470
Even the balcony seen action
cos I was balls deep on it.

10:07.406 --> 10:12.044
This trip has been amazing but now I
have to go back and face Sheep Steve.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.813
I cannot be arsed.

10:18.117 --> 10:22.922
Gary's skills include bucking birds
and booking trips.

10:22.989 --> 10:27.326
Amazing. He's just like some
crazy sexual travel agent.

10:27.393 --> 10:31.263
(pilot) We're going to on the ground
in two minutes.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.799
You can get out and kiss the ground.

10:33.866 --> 10:37.403
I don't know if James will be there
or not be there when I get back.

10:37.470 --> 10:42.708
I don't care, but for everyone's sake
we're gonna have to sort something.

10:42.775 --> 10:47.246
Make sure those seatbelts are done
up for me. There's a few bumps.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.355
(all) Hi.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.960
Finally they come strolling
through the door

11:01.027 --> 11:02.762
as if they've never been away.

11:07.933 --> 11:11.504
I thought youse had been.
Top ten beaches in the world.

11:11.570 --> 11:15.708
They've been going out seeing amazing
things, getting absolutely mortal

11:15.775 --> 11:17.610
having the time of their lives.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.112
It's just been us three
in the house.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.149
He's not come back.

11:23.215 --> 11:25.618
James has not come back,
which I expected.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.088
If you do anything bad,
everyone knows you get kicked out.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.727
And say bye to everyone.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.534
(phone rings)

11:42.935 --> 11:43.936
Hello.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.005
It is Gary.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:59.852 --> 12:02.822
Sheep Steve is punishing me
for the other night,

12:02.888 --> 12:05.291
but there is no way
I'm saying sorry to James.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.026
He's the idiot.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.667
What did he say?
Pack me stuff and go and join James.

12:14.733 --> 12:19.238
To apologise. That kid punched me.
Not fucking apologising to anyone.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.712
Hey, Gary, what you doing?

12:32.084 --> 12:34.653
If James had to go,
then so should he.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.490
They were both as much to blame
in that situation.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.295
See you later, bruv.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.252
This is the best news I've had
the whole entire trip.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.587
Finally Gary's got
what's coming to him,

13:08.654 --> 13:12.258
finally he's getting punished
for his stupid skinny actions.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.928
Finally I can enjoy this
without him being here.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.042
See you later on.
Bye.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.944
I'm gonna go on a date with Dan.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.214
It's gonna be the last time
I see him. I've got to be honest.

13:35.281 --> 13:39.051
For me, meeting him was one of
the best things that happened.

13:41.554 --> 13:45.057
He's not there, all I can think is
I'm getting stood up.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.626
He's realised
he's better looking than us.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.695
This is how nerves are affecting us.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.268
Jesus Christ, I need a drink.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.837
You look nice.
Thank you. So do you.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.640
What are you up to?
We just got back today.

14:04.710 --> 14:05.711
No.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.983
I'm telling you the truth,
don't embarrass us.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.085
I don't want to look like
a massive tit

14:13.152 --> 14:15.054
who's been saving meself for him.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.457
Cos I met you last week and I saw
you the day before I went away,

14:18.524 --> 14:21.460
and cos I quite like you.

14:21.527 --> 14:26.131
"I didn't get with anyone else
cos I like you." What a wanker.

14:26.198 --> 14:30.703
You're a good girl.
A good girl after all. Yeah.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.838
Once I started
going on dates with Dan,

14:32.905 --> 14:34.840
I couldn't get with other people.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.543
I would have felt guilty
and I hope he sees this.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.612
I hope he doesn't think I'm soppy.

14:39.678 --> 14:43.449
Going out.
You going out-out, yeah?

14:43.515 --> 14:46.452
See, I wanna come,
but then I've got to get up early.

14:46.518 --> 14:49.054
Well, just come out for a couple.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.890
I'll just tag along
and be your wingman.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.667
I'm sick to death of staring
at these four walls

15:01.734 --> 15:05.037
so I'm sitting outside
and fucking Gaz rocks up.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.273
All right?

15:08.407 --> 15:12.611
I get to the punishment hotel
and fucking James is there. Awkward.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.583
I don't know what to say to Gaz

15:17.650 --> 15:20.519
and it sounds like he doesn't know
what to say to me.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.530
All I want is an apology saying,

15:31.597 --> 15:34.366
"Gaz, sorry I tried to punch you.
I shouldn't have."

15:34.433 --> 15:37.469
How hard can it be?
But he's that stubborn, he can't.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.610
It's far too soon
to resolve our differences.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.412
I'm glad he's in a separate room.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.280
All right.
Wicked, all right.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.482
Speak to you in the morning.
All right.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.455
I'm fuckin' buzzing.

15:56.522 --> 16:00.059
Tonight we're hitting World bar.
To get back at Gary,

16:00.125 --> 16:04.663
I'm gonna make sure that Scott
overtakes him on the pulling board.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.400
He is going to be
the ultimate pulling machine.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.444
It's a bit shit without my wingman.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.747
Just means I'm gonna have to pull
some birds for him as well.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.093
Sophie's given me a free pass
to pull.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.528
Next, I'll have to ask permission
to wank.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.141
We get to the club
and I'm already a bit pissed.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.611
I can't help but feel that this is
the last time I'm gonna see Dan.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.013
I think those two things
coupled together

16:55.080 --> 16:57.316
are making me
a little bit over amorous.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.055
What the hell?
Me and Joel don't go on like this.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.558
Vicky's only met him two minutes
and she's over him like a rash.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.560
I'm sure she had a fiance
a couple of month ago.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.016
Vicky, you can't just say that.
You'll blow the whole cover.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.119
He's not supposed to know
that you like him, fuck's sake.

17:41.527 --> 17:45.597
The next thing you know, Scott's got
four girls like he's Hugh Hefner.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.938
If you're a girl and want to
pull Scotty and he's drunk

17:53.005 --> 17:56.141
you've got a chance.
All you have to do is look at him.

17:56.208 --> 18:00.479
His numbers are going up so much
now. Gary's gonna be gutted.

18:06.985 --> 18:10.489
I get back to the house and I am
even drunker than I was in the club.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.991
I think it's a good idea
to continue drinking.

18:21.867 --> 18:25.571
Come and say hello.
This is Christina and Brie.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.744
My boyfriend is in
a complete mortal state.

18:32.811 --> 18:38.817
Joel, unappropriately, is
introducing them as No 11 and No 12.

18:38.884 --> 18:40.118
Let's get some drinks.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.657
Us Geordies can drink
and we can drink really well,

18:45.724 --> 18:49.695
and him being a Southerner
can't drink for absolute shit.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.763
To your room now.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.773
Looks like I didn't need my wingman.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.243
It's all right, Gaz,
I've got this covered.

19:08.146 --> 19:12.284
I am absolutely buzzing. My pulling
prowess has obviously worked.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.726
But I'm fucking mortal. I don't know
what he think I'm gonna do.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.794
I've lost all me motor skills.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.465
(snoring)

19:26.932 --> 19:29.935
This is the first place
I've felt happy in years.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.604
She needs to not speak to Ricci
at all.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.040
Sometimes when Scott pulls
I get jealous.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.243
I don't want him giving
some other girl attention.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.680
I'm making him put all his thoughts
on paper.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.249
Nothing Gary can say
can change anything.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.585
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

19:48.487 --> 19:48.687
.

19:51.189 --> 19:51.390
.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.979
I've woke up next to Dan.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.848
Did I have sex with him? No.

20:16.915 --> 20:21.453
Did I touch him
in inappropriate places? No.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.088
I just held his ear.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.593
(laughs)

20:32.431 --> 20:33.865
(laughs)

20:33.932 --> 20:35.801
I've woke up and I'm still pissed.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.170
I can't remember
a thing from last night,

20:38.236 --> 20:39.805
not a fucking sausage!

20:46.044 --> 20:50.449
If I'm this drunk now,
how fucking drunk was I last night?

20:53.685 --> 20:55.454
Still got me dress on.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.428
He's gone forever.

21:05.964 --> 21:06.965
Did you buck her?

21:07.032 --> 21:10.068
I can't believe all four of them
woulda came back.

21:10.135 --> 21:13.238
You bucked two of them?
Four wanted to come back, but...

21:13.305 --> 21:15.140
Four wanted have sex with him.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.142
Last night I had a wicked threesome

21:17.209 --> 21:19.645
and the lasses let themselves out.
Perfect!

21:21.647 --> 21:23.815
That's how much I was buzzing.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.484
So they nailed and bailed ya!

21:25.550 --> 21:27.886
Oh, my God!
Scott got smashed and nashed!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.588
No, just smashed.

21:36.595 --> 21:40.165
It's our last day in Australia
and we're going to see the beach.

21:40.232 --> 21:44.403
It's gonna be so awful to leave this
and go back to shitty Newcastle.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.772
So hot on me back, I'll miss this.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.174
I know.
I'll definitely miss the weather.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.678
It's a bit of a shame
that James and Gary can't be here.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.881
I know.
Talk about everything with them.

21:55.947 --> 21:59.217
We started this as a family
and I wanted to end it the same way.

21:59.284 --> 22:02.421
Losing James and Gary
for our last night,

22:02.487 --> 22:05.590
it's just gonna mean that tonight
won't feel the same.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.095
Yeah.
It's always gonna be awkward now.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.166
Especially after that. I don't think
they can ever make up again.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.301
It's the end of our time
in Australia.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.804
It's been brilliant
and I don't wanna go home.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.377
(Sophie) How was it with Dan?

22:25.444 --> 22:29.047
I wish I could tell youse.
I've got no fucking clue.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.982
I can't remember a fucking thing.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.218
You seemed happy though last night.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.353
I was happy, babe. I am happy.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.789
I'm finally happy.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.426
In this house, everyone's got
so many of their own problems.

22:41.493 --> 22:45.197
I've been forthright sometimes
with how I feel about Ricci.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.866
I've got over him on me own.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.902
And I'm proud of myself.

22:50.969 --> 22:55.474
He's just been the first person
that's made us happy. Yeah.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.412
I just want more time
to be on my own, I think. Yeah.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.748
Are you just glad
you've moved on as well?

23:02.814 --> 23:05.717
Yeah, I'm getting dead sad.
(all) Why?

23:05.784 --> 23:07.452
Why?
I don't know.

23:07.519 --> 23:12.457
Just cos this is the first place that
I've felt happy in fucking years,

23:12.524 --> 23:14.126
and I'm scared to go back.

23:14.192 --> 23:18.063
Coming half away around the world
was the only thing I could have done

23:18.130 --> 23:20.932
to forget him and get over him,

23:20.999 --> 23:24.035
and try and get
some semblance of meself back.

23:25.837 --> 23:29.107
You don't need to be scared.
You need to be positive about it.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.409
You're on your own,
you're independent.

23:31.476 --> 23:34.412
This has kind of been
a steeping stone for you. Yeah.

23:34.479 --> 23:37.282
I just don't want to go home
and go back over.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.251
Yeah, well...
You won't.

23:39.317 --> 23:43.188
I hope that Vicky can carry on
being the person she is in Australia

23:43.255 --> 23:44.422
back in Newcastle.

23:44.489 --> 23:47.492
Strong, happy and confident.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.728
She needs to not speak to Ricci
at all.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.696
This has made you so strong, Vic.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.599
You've proved to yourself
and all of us

23:54.666 --> 23:56.535
that you don't need him any more.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.969
I'll miss Dan.

23:58.036 --> 24:00.372
I'm a little bit down.

24:00.438 --> 24:05.410
I've had one of the best experiences
of me life, and today we leave that.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.921
I come to pack me stuff.
It's my last time in this house.

24:15.987 --> 24:18.523
I just hope Charlotte's there
to say bye.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.225
All right, Gary?

24:22.394 --> 24:25.697
(laughter)
Good to see you.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.967
I really don't know what's
gonna happen between me and Gaz,

24:29.034 --> 24:32.537
but to be honest, I've got more
important things to think about,

24:32.604 --> 24:34.472
like saying bye to me true friends.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.409
Is everyone all right now?

24:41.880 --> 24:42.948
What the hell?

24:43.014 --> 24:46.117
I'm so sad that I'm not gonna
be around for the last night,

24:46.184 --> 24:49.788
cos this is always the best night
where everyone comes together,

24:49.855 --> 24:52.090
reminisces on such a good time
we've had.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.892
It's shit I'm not gonna be here.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.428
Where's Holly and thingy?
Don't know.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.697
Erm, girls went out.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.266
Charlotte and Holly
are out somewhere.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.869
I never thought
my time here would end

25:03.935 --> 25:07.205
not saying bye to Charlotte
and not speaking to James.

25:07.272 --> 25:10.008
I'm not even drinking tonight.
No way. Why?

25:10.075 --> 25:12.244
What's the point? No one's together.

25:15.113 --> 25:18.717
Do you feel a bit sad that you're
not gonna be saying bye to Char?

25:19.784 --> 25:23.421
Even with Char,
it's like it's different this time.

25:23.488 --> 25:25.523
I think cos you know each other
so well,

25:25.590 --> 25:28.260
youse can have one of
the best friendships ever.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.262
Just tell her that I said the same.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.297
Do you not want to leave her a note?

25:32.364 --> 25:36.601
I know you know she likes that.
She loves shit like that. A note?

25:36.668 --> 25:40.038
After everything that Charlotte
and Gary has been through,

25:40.105 --> 25:42.540
I can't believe Gary
had the absolute guts

25:42.607 --> 25:46.544
to think that he was gonna leave
without saying bye to Charlotte.

25:46.611 --> 25:50.248
'Finally, I'm making him put
all this thoughts on paper.'

25:50.315 --> 25:52.851
I haven't got a clue
what to write in this note,

25:52.918 --> 25:56.922
but it's probably easier writing it
than saying it to Charlotte's face.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.867
I'm so shocked.
I can't believe what Gary's writing.

26:08.934 --> 26:12.570
Finally he's showing his emotion.
He's opening up,

26:12.637 --> 26:15.440
but why does he need to do this
when it came to the end.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.977
If he'd done this before, him
and Charlotte would have been OK.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.180
I reckon hide it somewhere
she'll never see it. She will.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.750
Like, in her make-up bag or
something. Put it in her make-up bag.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.759
I'm packing me case
and it's starting to sink in.

26:34.826 --> 26:37.862
This is it.
My Australia trip's over.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.698
All right?
Can I come in?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.166
Aye, course you can.

26:41.232 --> 26:44.169
I've got so much stuff
to get off me chest with James.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.905
I wanna tell him how sorry I am
about the argument,

26:46.972 --> 26:50.008
how I feel guilty he's not
gonna spend his last night here.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.543
I feel like it's my fault.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.778
I'm really, really sad
to see you go,

26:53.845 --> 26:59.417
especially cos it's something
I feel, like, sort of responsible.

26:59.484 --> 27:03.221
Honestly, don't worry about it.
Me and Gaz have always had a bit...

27:03.288 --> 27:05.290
But it's nowt to do with you.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.626
Vicky feel guilty about
what happened between me and Gaz,

27:08.693 --> 27:12.163
but she doesn't have to cos she's
been there for me in Australia,

27:12.230 --> 27:14.099
so I just wanted
to be there for her.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.801
It's shit that Charlotte and Holly
are not here.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.337
You'll have to tell them bye
from us.

27:19.404 --> 27:21.039
I will, I'll tell them.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.441
Who would have thought
you'd be saying,

27:23.508 --> 27:26.077
"I'm gutted I can't say bye
to Holly and that?"

27:26.144 --> 27:28.446
It's a shame Holly's not here
to say bye to

27:28.513 --> 27:30.648
cos I'm so glad that we somehow

27:30.715 --> 27:34.686
managed to sort out all of our
differences and get on better.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.622
It benefited everyone in the house.

27:37.689 --> 27:41.192
See ya, babe.
Love youse all, man.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.769
After everything
me and Scott have done,

27:50.835 --> 27:52.937
we've absolutely smashed Australia

27:53.004 --> 27:56.674
it's shit that me and him haven't
got this last night out together.

27:58.209 --> 28:02.147
This is the last time I'm gonna get
to walk down these stairs.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.149
I really am gonna miss these girls,

28:04.215 --> 28:07.519
but at least I know I've got
a good 'un waiting for us at home.

28:07.585 --> 28:09.187
I can't wait to see Kate.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.126
I can't believe this is how
my time in Australia ended.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.128
I can't even say bye to Charlotte.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.464
I never thought
I would lose her as a friend.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.877
Gary and James have just left.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.180
Have they?
So we didn't get to say bye.

28:35.246 --> 28:36.448
They wrote you a note.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.219
I just didn't think
the end with me Gary

28:41.286 --> 28:46.958
would be so crap or uneventful,
or just nothing.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.462
No note, not phased.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.665
I know that he left her a letter
but I don't wanna tell her.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.867
I want her to find out
in her own way.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.635
We'll have a good night anyway.

29:13.551 --> 29:16.888
To the last remaining housemates.
Australia!

29:16.955 --> 29:19.224
He can't be bothered
to spend it with us?

29:19.290 --> 29:21.893
Tonight is the family's
last night in Australia,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.462
so we're gonna make it one
to fucking remember.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.065
Do I want to have took
all these steps forward

29:27.132 --> 29:29.801
to just go all the way back again?
What the hell?

29:29.868 --> 29:32.604
Yet again, another classy night.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.639
Just typical.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.075
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

29:38.943 --> 29:39.144
.

29:41.679 --> 29:41.880
.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.223
Scott! What you been doing?

29:52.290 --> 29:55.059
Doing this!
(screams) You got it!

29:55.126 --> 29:56.728
Oh, my God!

29:56.794 --> 30:00.832
What? Really? Are you kidding me?

30:02.267 --> 30:04.936
Tonight is the family's
last night in Australia,

30:05.003 --> 30:07.272
so I wanna make it one
to fucking remember.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.309
(all cheering)

30:11.376 --> 30:13.244
Cheers, everyone! It's a Hummer!

30:13.311 --> 30:15.647
(girls scream)

30:15.713 --> 30:17.148
Oh, my God!

30:17.215 --> 30:20.084
This night is getting
very, very good.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.219
Buzzing!

30:21.286 --> 30:24.489
Thank God it's big enough
to fit me and my chest in.

30:30.628 --> 30:33.598
The Hummer is the perfect way
to pick everyone up,

30:33.665 --> 30:36.467
and make everyone realise
that this our last night,

30:36.534 --> 30:38.436
and we've got to make
the best of it.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.805
Get that cock out, son!

30:45.210 --> 30:46.311
Let's get fucked!

30:48.112 --> 30:51.849
Scary Canary's been me best club
while I've been in Australia.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.151
We always get so messy.

31:02.293 --> 31:05.997
It's the last night and I look over
and Scott's talking to girls.

31:14.239 --> 31:17.041
Holly's in a bad mood
cos she's not getting drilled,

31:17.108 --> 31:19.611
but she's not going
anywhere near my tool box.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.340
I'm surprised and I'm shocked.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.376
What the hell could be in the letter?

31:51.442 --> 31:53.645
Do I even want to know?

32:00.485 --> 32:03.921
I am intrigued to know what's in
the letter. Of course I am.

32:03.988 --> 32:08.092
Maybe it's things I've never known
cos he can never tell us to me face.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.066
Me night's been shit!

32:17.402 --> 32:20.571
Look at me. Say sorry.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.006
Say sorry.
What?

32:22.073 --> 32:25.243
Say sorry. Sor-ry.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.246
I'm flirting with Scott
and I don't know what I'm doing.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.682
Right now,
I'm acting like a fucking weirdo.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.383
But I'm not gonna suck him off.

32:32.450 --> 32:37.221
Let's do a kebab
cos it's our last night. Kebab!

32:37.288 --> 32:40.558
We're on the other side of the world
and the girls want a kebab.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.361
It's about time
you started hammering the lettuce.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.029
We need kebabs!

32:45.096 --> 32:48.966
I need a wee.
I need a wee really bad.

32:49.033 --> 32:53.037
(laughs) I can't wee there. I can't
wee in front of all these people.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.841
Yet again, another classy night.
Charlotte's pissing on the floor

32:56.908 --> 33:00.845
right next to the kebab shop and
we're shielding her, just typical.

33:13.925 --> 33:17.295
Hung-over as fuck,
as per fucking usual

33:17.362 --> 33:19.263
I'm a little bit down.

33:19.330 --> 33:23.901
I've had one of the best experiences
of me life, and today we leave that.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.136
This is a nightmare.

33:25.203 --> 33:28.306
Why didn't we do this
before last night? I don't know.

33:28.373 --> 33:31.109
I put the note
in Charlotte's make-up bag

33:31.175 --> 33:33.277
and I don't know
if she's gonna read it,

33:33.344 --> 33:36.681
but the fact of the matter is
that he did want to say bye.

33:36.748 --> 33:41.018
Did you know about this?
Yeah, sort of.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.522
I don't know what'll be in the
letter, or it's gonna make us feel.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.258
Do I want to have took
all these steps forward

33:47.325 --> 33:49.060
to just go all the way back again?

33:49.127 --> 33:51.863
Don't get upset, mate.
No, I'm not getting upset.

33:51.929 --> 33:55.133
I'm just not gonna read it.
Why?

33:56.601 --> 33:58.736
Cos I just feel like I don't have to.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.439
Nothing Gary can say now
could change anything,

34:01.506 --> 34:03.708
but I don't want it messing
with me head.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.185
Well, it's the last day.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.589
Well, it's just me
and you four girls.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.925
That's weird.
Oh, God, yeah.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.927
We can have the biggest arguments,

34:22.994 --> 34:26.898
say the most horrible things about
each other, but it doesn't matter.

34:26.964 --> 34:29.067
In this house,
we all just get over it.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.569
Deep down,
we all love each other so much.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.638
I feel like without a doubt,

34:33.704 --> 34:37.175
this has been the most dramatic
and, like, confrontational,

34:37.241 --> 34:38.842
do you know what I mean?

34:38.909 --> 34:41.478
It's so sad to be leaving
without Gary and James

34:41.545 --> 34:43.681
because they are part of
this family,

34:43.748 --> 34:47.418
and them not being here
is just heart-breaking

34:47.485 --> 34:50.588
and hopefully one day
they'll be able to resolve it.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.489
I'll miss youse.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.257
Miss youse, too.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.494
Miss you already.
Miss youse.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.697
The lasses do me head in,
but I feel like their protector.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.200
They're like sisters
and I'm gonna miss them.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.503
To the last remaining housemates.
Australia!

35:05.570 --> 35:07.171
Smashed.
Piped.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.707
Rested.
(laughter)

35:09.774 --> 35:12.643
Spunked all over Australia's face.

35:14.312 --> 35:15.513
(line ringing)

35:16.948 --> 35:18.416
(Dan) "Hello."
Hi, babe.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.284
"Hello, darling. How are you?"

35:20.351 --> 35:22.887
Calling Dan to say goodbye
is a little bit sad.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.491
I feel as though it's the last time
I'll ever really speak to him.

35:26.557 --> 35:29.227
I'm just all packed.

35:29.293 --> 35:32.563
"Oh, you're leaving me, eh?"
Yes, I am.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.765
He lives on the other side of
the world

35:34.832 --> 35:37.101
and let's be serious,
it was what it was.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.437
"I'm a bit sad."
Just a little bit?

35:39.504 --> 35:41.339
"Yeah."
Aww.

35:41.405 --> 35:45.042
It was a holiday romance.
It was a pretty good one at that.

35:45.109 --> 35:49.580
Well, you've got me number
so just message us whenever, OK?

35:49.647 --> 35:52.650
"If I come over, you're gonna
have to look after me."

35:52.717 --> 35:55.553
Yeah, I'll show you
how it's done in Newcastle.

35:58.055 --> 35:59.223
Fuck's sake.

36:02.293 --> 36:03.294
Fuck.

36:04.929 --> 36:09.000
Lad, absolute legend.
I'll see you again soon.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.168
(Sophie) I'm so sad.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.037
The time in Australia for me

36:13.104 --> 36:16.307
has been the best ever time
in my whole life.

36:16.374 --> 36:20.811
I'm with me boyfriend, I love him
so much and everyone loves him, too.

36:20.878 --> 36:25.149
We love you.
Bye, Joel. Bye, Soph. Bye!

36:30.521 --> 36:35.092
My turn to go now.
Don't go! (sobs)

36:37.762 --> 36:41.599
You annoy me so much but I love ya.

36:41.666 --> 36:44.135
I love you.
Come here.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.538
Scott is a big part of
my life in the house

36:47.605 --> 36:51.242
because I do go to him for cuddles
and he does give me attention.

36:51.309 --> 36:54.211
And that daft smile
just seems to make everything OK,

36:54.278 --> 36:56.881
and I absolutely love him
and I'm gonna miss him.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.050
I'm gonna take the Merc.
(laughter)

36:59.116 --> 37:01.452
Aye, so...
No bother, we'll be all right.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.888
We'll get a taxi or something.
(laughter)

37:03.955 --> 37:06.624
This house has got something
to remember me by.

37:06.691 --> 37:10.861
Massive holes in the walls, smashed
lamps and a broken piano. Come on!

37:10.928 --> 37:14.599
See you later, Scott. We love ya.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.834
Bye, Scotty fucking T!

37:17.969 --> 37:20.104
Regardless of what everyone thinks,

37:20.171 --> 37:23.107
me and Gaz haven't been
in competition in Australia.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.209
But if I had,
I won it by a fucking mile.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.483
You thinking about
going back to Newcastle? Yeah.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.985
Are you scared?
Yeah.

37:36.287 --> 37:40.157
Don't be scared. I haven't had to
think about it while I've been here,

37:40.224 --> 37:41.692
do you know what I mean?

37:42.927 --> 37:46.263
I've allowed meself to live
in a little post break-up bubble

37:46.330 --> 37:48.165
and it's bloody comfortable here.

37:48.232 --> 37:51.268
It's nice, but I know that
as soon as I get off that plane

37:51.335 --> 37:52.937
and me feet touch the ground,

37:53.004 --> 37:56.774
I'll have to deal with all of it
head on, and I'm fucking petrified.

37:56.841 --> 38:00.778
Like, I knew if I was ever
feeling sad or ever feeling down,

38:00.845 --> 38:04.348
I could find youse.
Youse weren't far. Yeah.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.251
Every day we're together
and we're gonna go from that

38:07.318 --> 38:09.353
to not being together any more.
I know.

38:10.454 --> 38:14.358
Sometimes, I do wish
I could just stay here forever,

38:14.425 --> 38:18.129
but I'm braver than that
and I'm stronger than that now.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.530
And I can do it.

38:19.597 --> 38:23.267
It's gonna be a bit shit,
but I can do it.

38:23.334 --> 38:26.437
Get over your cock fright.
(laughs)

38:26.504 --> 38:29.774
Cos I'm on my own out there.
(laughs)

38:29.840 --> 38:32.276
Bye, Vicks.
Bye, girls.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.279
I love youse.
Love you, too.

38:35.346 --> 38:36.947
Good luck!
Thank you!

38:41.085 --> 38:44.455
It's a bit shit how we didn't get
to say bye to Gary and James.

38:44.522 --> 38:48.459
Would have been nice to clarify
with James everything that happened.

38:48.526 --> 38:49.727
Nice to have a chat.

38:49.794 --> 38:52.797
My intentions were just
to completely ignore James,

38:52.863 --> 38:56.600
and I am really happy
that we're actually leaving

38:56.667 --> 38:58.369
with some kind of friendship.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.172
It's not the same,
but there is still something.

39:01.238 --> 39:03.808
I never wanted to not be his friend.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.477
It's just I couldn't let myself
be his friend.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.613
Normal families couldn't get through
what we've done,

39:09.680 --> 39:13.184
and no matter what's happened,
we're always there for each other.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.685
We are a family.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.721
Big incestuous...
Boo.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.758
(laughs)
What the hell?

39:20.825 --> 39:24.128
Gary's just walked in. Eh?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.130
I've just come to say bye in person.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.500
I'm glad you've come to say bye.
We just got a note on the board.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.103
You got your little note?
I didn't read it.

39:32.169 --> 39:35.973
I'm shocked. I don't know what's
happening. Why has he came back?

39:36.040 --> 39:40.044
Erm... Oh, it's so hard.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.880
Do I need to give youse a minute?
Yeah, go on.

39:42.947 --> 39:46.851
I thought this was gonna be an easy
goodbye, but it's gonna be so hard.

39:50.688 --> 39:52.256
I don't need to know, you know?

39:52.323 --> 39:55.726
I know, but you had to know
from me personally, like.

39:55.793 --> 39:59.597
Like, and honestly, my best times
in here have been with you.

39:59.663 --> 40:02.666
They always will be.
And I think Mitch is a lucky lad,

40:02.733 --> 40:06.337
and I hope that if he gets any of
the memories that we had together,

40:06.403 --> 40:08.305
he's the luckiest man in the world.

40:08.372 --> 40:11.442
At me lowest point, Gary made us
feel like I was worthless.

40:11.509 --> 40:15.346
Like I wasn't worth the shit on his
shoe, like he didn't care about us.

40:15.412 --> 40:18.048
And I just hope
he doesn't do that to another girl

40:18.115 --> 40:20.317
cos it's the worst feeling
in the world.

40:20.384 --> 40:22.853
I've had a lucky escape,
a very lucky escape.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.189
He is lucky
cos all the memories I've had,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.057
he's got all them coming up.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.960
And I hope he makes you happy
cos I say you deserve it.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.563
No matter what happens
with me and Charlotte,

40:32.630 --> 40:34.698
there will still be
some kind of bond,

40:34.765 --> 40:37.201
and there will always be
a Gary and Charlotte.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.471
You know I'll always be your friend.
I know you will.

40:47.411 --> 40:51.215
I'm not just leaving Gary here,
I'm leaving Charlotte and Gary here.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.516
It's the end.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.652
This is actually the end this time.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.488
I know. No kisses, no nothing.
Bye.

40:57.555 --> 40:58.856
See ya, Hol.
Bye, Gary.

41:02.526 --> 41:03.928
What did he say?

41:03.994 --> 41:07.198
He knows that the memories
that we've had has been his best,

41:07.264 --> 41:10.701
and he said that he knows that Mitch
has got all of them to come.

41:10.768 --> 41:14.505
He thinks he's such a lucky lad
for having such a great person.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.083
(groans) Fuck.

41:32.823 --> 41:36.861
But one day he's gonna realise
that he missed out on everything,

41:36.927 --> 41:40.865
and he's gonna, like,
hate himself for it.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.171
(exhales) Fucking hell.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.145
Australia,
the Geordies have landed!

41:56.113 --> 41:57.281
Ugh! Ugh!

41:57.348 --> 41:59.149
I fucking hate emus.

42:02.052 --> 42:06.357
I'm back in the fucking Geordie
Shore house and I'm fucking mortal.

42:07.391 --> 42:09.560
It's the day
that Joel's gonna get here.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.798
It's Joel!
Oh, Gary's got fanny!

42:16.133 --> 42:18.702
There's some crazy bird
naked in the garden.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.938
God forbid I have any tan lines.

42:21.005 --> 42:23.607
What the fuck are youse doing
hiding down there?

42:23.674 --> 42:27.044
Awkward! Steve's picking up
the sofa drenched in my piss.

42:27.111 --> 42:28.545
That was wet, too.

42:28.612 --> 42:30.114
To Sydney!

42:32.850 --> 42:35.386
I don't know who the fuck
the kid thinks he is.

42:36.353 --> 42:39.523
We're having a good time, hooray!

42:39.590 --> 42:42.426
Scott's fucking flipped!
(all yelling)

42:47.264 --> 42:48.933
Plenty tashing.

42:48.999 --> 42:52.002
My mission tonight is to pull.
