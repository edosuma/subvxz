<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:17.642 --> 00:20.353
<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.814
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:22.897 --> 00:25.817
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:28.445
<i>Under here, over there</i>

00:28.528 --> 00:30.905
<i>Science is everywhere you look</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:33.867
<i>With Iggy Peck, architect</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:36.369
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:39.122
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.000
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.083 --> 00:45.128
<i>There are wonders to discover</i>
<i>And hypotheses to test</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.546
<i>Science is the best!</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:49.132
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:52.010
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:52.510 --> 00:56.222
<i>Everywhere science is</i>
<i>She’s forming a hypothesis</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.642
<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is Scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:04.773 --> 01:06.066
Six, seven, eight.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.903
Yep, that should be enough chairs
for the audience. Nice design work, Iggy.

01:09.986 --> 01:13.239
All we need now
is for someone to make a big entrance.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.700
I’m here!

01:15.784 --> 01:19.412
Are the programmes ready? Snacks? Tickets?
What time does the audience get here?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.456
I’m usually the one
with all the questions.

01:21.539 --> 01:25.335
Sorry. Since I’ve been taking
piano lessons with my Great Aunt Rose,

01:25.418 --> 01:27.212
I’ve gotten really good.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.214
I can’t wait for our first ever

01:29.297 --> 01:32.717
Saturday-afternoon
living-room concert recital.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.260
I’m excited too.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.222
I’m nervous.
And excited! But mostly nervous.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.807
Well, everything’s ready.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.560
Chairs, tickets, programmes
and our instruments, of course.

01:42.644 --> 01:46.106
My musical beakers.
Where music meets science.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.526
And my Boom-Boom Blaster.
Isn’t it beautiful?

01:49.609 --> 01:53.822
It’s like a skyscraper made of drums.
Call me Iggy Peck, drum architect.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.827
For me, it’s less about the loudness
and more about the design.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.620
-Heya!
-Morning, hon.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.748
This is a sharp-looking piano,
Mr and Mrs T.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.876
Ought to be able to play
a real nice, bouncy C.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.462
That’s how my Great Aunt Rose
talks about music.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.215
It’s so nice
to see this old thing get some use.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.884
Remember how you used to serenade me?

02:14.968 --> 02:18.054
<i>I still do, baby</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:23.852
Your concert got me thinking.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.271
I might wanna dig out my old bass
from the garage,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.398
have a little Saturday-morning jam.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.067
Sounds delicious.
Make mine strawberry with toast.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.570
My dad means a musical jam, Iggy.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.906
When you make music up on the spot,
just for fun.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.161
That’s awesome,
and disappointing at the same time.

02:41.244 --> 02:45.498
-I’ll get you some strawberry jam.
-Nice! Thanks, Mr Twist.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.042
One hour, everybody. One hour.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.879
Did your brother
turn into a human alarm clock?

02:50.962 --> 02:53.590
No, he just promised
to be our stage manager.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.634
As long as I get to open the show
with some of my magic.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.179
I’m gonna pull a rabbit out of this hat.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.475
One hour.

03:05.059 --> 03:08.313
One hour? Oh my gosh.
I hope I practised enough.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.981
That’s forever from now.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.651
-So let’s rehearse while we wait.
-Okay. I can get my nerves out.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.071
I don’t know exactly how that works,
but my mum always says it.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.741
Great thinking.
First, we need a running order.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.534
No one said anything about running.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.913
No, a running order
is who plays first, second and third.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.706
We could all play together.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.626
But then the audience
won’t get to see each of our talents.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.002
Iggy, you’ll go first.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.924
Your Boom-Boom Blaster
will really wake up the crowd.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.967
But everybody will already be awake.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.304
It doesn’t have to be too loud, right?

03:42.513 --> 03:47.852
-Maybe I can just show it off.
-Ada will play her musical beakers next.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.355
DJ Beakers in the lab.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.357
Then I’ll play.

04:00.448 --> 04:04.994
I’ve been practising for weeks,
and I’m really good.

04:05.912 --> 04:10.250
When I play, it’s like my fingers
are dancing across the keys.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.710
Like I’m two-stepping over the ivories.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.379
Like this.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.760
Where did all my talent go?

04:20.843 --> 04:23.680
Aunt Rose is gonna be so disappointed
when she hears me.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.640
Know what might help? Science.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.810
We could solve this problem
using a scientific method.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.020
<i>Scientific method</i>

04:31.104 --> 04:32.855
<i>We have an observation</i>

04:32.939 --> 04:35.066
<i>So we’ll start with a question</i>

04:35.608 --> 04:37.777
<i>-Do research</i>
-<i>Form a hypothesis</i>

04:37.860 --> 04:40.321
<i>And test with experiments</i>

04:40.405 --> 04:42.156
<i>What did we find out?</i>

04:42.657 --> 04:44.450
<i>Let’s draw a conclusion</i>

04:45.243 --> 04:49.580
<i>And write it all down</i>
<i>And pass around the results</i>

04:49.664 --> 04:52.125
<i>That’s the scientific method</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:53.793
To start, we’ll need--

04:53.876 --> 04:55.545
A hippo-sis-sissi-mist!

04:55.628 --> 04:59.299
A hypothesis.
We’re going to imagine an explanation.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.176
I’ve got a hypothesis. Frogs.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.803
-Frogs?
-Go on.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.806
One time when I was sick,
I sounded really funny,

05:06.889 --> 05:09.017
and my mum said I had frogs in my throat!

05:09.100 --> 05:12.312
So maybe some got into the piano.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.902
Let’s test your hypothesis
by looking inside.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.864
Nope. No frogs.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.075
Just dust.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.078
Or wicked fairy dust?

05:29.579 --> 05:31.831
Maybe a fairy who hates music

05:31.914 --> 05:37.128
could be trying to stop our recital
by sprinkling bad fairy dust everywhere.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.547
Interesting theory. Let’s test it.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.469
There. No more dust.
Go ahead, Rosie. Play something.

05:47.555 --> 05:51.267
Guess it wasn’t wicked fairy dust
after all. I was so sure.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.980
Maybe it’s my fingers. Great Aunt Rose
always talks about limbering them up.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.399
That must be it.
Your fingers aren’t warmed up.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.862
So we’ve just got to give them
a good workout.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.794
My fingers are in tip-top shape.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.716
We tried everything.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.844
If we could just see what was wrong,
then we could fix it.

06:28.137 --> 06:31.224
Just leave me here
and do the recital around me.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.727
Come on, Rosie!
Scientists don’t quit. We’ve got grit.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.938
Here comes the Jelly-Jiggler.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.151
Why is the Jelly-Jiggler jiggling?

06:42.235 --> 06:47.657
The more important question is what’s
that sound and why is it getting louder?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.034
It’s a unicorn-a-saurus!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.119
Take cover!

06:51.869 --> 06:54.831
Kids, I don’t think
that’s a unicorn-a-saurus.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.291
It’s just your dad
warming up his bass in the garage.

06:57.375 --> 07:02.213
Your dad can make his bass
sound like a unicorn-a-saurus? Cool!

07:02.296 --> 07:06.551
Or the sound of dad’s bass
was making the Jelly-Jiggler jiggle.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.344
This we’ve got to see.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.640
-Hey, kids.
-Hi, Dad!

07:14.016 --> 07:17.728
The sound of Dad’s bass
is making the Jelly-Jiggler jiggle.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.605
I read about this and took some notes

07:19.689 --> 07:22.483
in my big book
of discoveries and inventions.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.568
Come on.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.695
Hey, where are you going?

07:25.778 --> 07:28.489
It’s been a while,
but I didn’t think I was that bad.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.575
Loading the lab.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.544
Here are my notes.

07:41.627 --> 07:46.549
Sound pushes tiny air molecules around,
which turns them into sound waves.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.342
Neat trick.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.679
But we usually can’t see the waves,
because they’re teeny.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.764
But Dad’s bass is so loud

07:53.848 --> 07:57.268
that the sound waves
hit the Jelly-Jiggler so hard it jiggles.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.644
Like this.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.109
Too bad we can’t see
the sound of Rosie’s playing.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.738
Then we could figure out why it’s so bad.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.282
-Sorry, Rosie.
-Hey, it’s the truth, Ruth.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.076
Iggy, you’re a genius.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.953
-I am?
-Own it, Iggy.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.997
I mean, I am. I am!

08:18.956 --> 08:19.790
Why?

08:19.874 --> 08:23.336
Because maybe there is a way
we can see Rosie’s music.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.004
With an oscilloscope.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.590
Of course! An oh-silly-oh-scope.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.511
I mean, oh-sill-oh… Nope, that’s not it.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.890
An oscilloscope. A machine
that shows sound as lines on a monitor.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.434
I’ll design a simple one we can make.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.812
Looks like we can make it with… Let’s see.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.774
An old smartphone, a TV, an umbrella…

08:45.399 --> 08:47.026
and three jellybeans.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.237
-What are the jellybeans for?
-My mouth.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.905
Let’s get to work!

08:58.704 --> 09:02.458
Great job, you two.
Now let’s put this oscilloscope to work.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.296
Okay, Rosie. Ready when you are.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.173
Ten minutes till showtime.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.553
-What?! How did that get in there?
-We’ve got to hurry.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.014
The oscilloscope’s working.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.351
But is that what music
is supposed to look like?

09:20.434 --> 09:22.645
It’s so wonky.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.148
Dad, play something funky.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.527
You are in luck.
“Funky” is my middle name.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.908
Now, that looks more musical.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.660
That means it’s in tune.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.664
See how the curved lines follow a pattern?
That’s how you can tell.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.208
That is so cool!

09:44.292 --> 09:45.585
Now you, Rosie.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.755
Those two sounds look totally different.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.717
Mr Twist’s funky music makes smooth lines

09:52.800 --> 09:55.177
and the piano music makes wonky lines.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.473
The smooth lines mean the bass is in tune,

09:59.557 --> 10:04.020
so those wonky lines
must mean the piano’s out of tune.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.772
Yes, that’s what it looks like,
and sounds like.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.318
Yay! It’s not me or my talent.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.320
We can fix this.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.489
We just have to tighten the strings
the right amount

10:16.073 --> 10:17.700
till the piano is in tune.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.993
Give me a bouncy C, Rosie.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.997
That should do it. Play something.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.128
-Yay!
-I’m back!

10:29.211 --> 10:33.132
The audience is here.
Zero minutes, people. Zero minutes.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.717
It’s showtime.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.138
Yup.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.765
-Nice.
-Nice!

10:44.310 --> 10:47.772
Ladies and gentlemen,
there’s been a last-minute change.

10:47.855 --> 10:51.150
Instead of playing solos,
my friends and I will play as a group.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.444
That’s how we solved a big problem today.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.863
And that’s how we work best. Together.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.908
-So we’d better get the toast.
-Why?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.577
Because it’s time to jam!

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
But not too hard.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.422
-Hey! All right!
-Yeah!

11:13.506 --> 11:15.299
-Okay!
-Yeah!

11:20.012 --> 11:24.100
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.107
Hi, I’m Susan Miziker.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.610
And I’m Doctor Avila.
We’re both doctors of audiology.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.613
We’re here today
to talk about how the ear works

11:37.697 --> 11:40.157
and how you hear sound waves.

11:40.241 --> 11:44.161
People come to us
when they have a hearing-related problem.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.664
We measure how people hear.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.541
Whether you can hear soft whispers…

11:48.624 --> 11:49.959
Hi. How are you?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.502
…or loud sounds!

11:51.585 --> 11:56.799
So the sound, as I’m talking,
travels all the way into…

11:56.882 --> 11:58.467
-My ear.
-Right there.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.096
The ear funnels the sound to the eardrum.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.474
The eardrum vibrates with the sound wave,

12:05.558 --> 12:09.019
and then the little bones
that are attached behind the eardrum

12:09.103 --> 12:13.399
send that vibration into the inner ear.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.693
That’s where the cochlea is.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.486
The cochlea’s very special

12:17.570 --> 12:24.034
because it turns the vibrations of sound
into signals that are sent to the brain

12:24.118 --> 12:27.204
so that the brain
knows what you are hearing.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.291
Fun fact!

12:30.374 --> 12:32.877
Earwax is actually good for you.

12:32.960 --> 12:39.216
It protects you from particles of dust,
and bacteria and fungal infections.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.094
Even insects from getting into your ear.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.307
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

12:52.021 --> 12:56.233
Just a few more colours
and this unicorn painting will be done.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.360
Unicorns love colour!

13:00.654 --> 13:02.823
Dance floor is almost ready.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.160
And party hats are almost glittery enough.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.707
Mooshu, you’re part of the glitterati now.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.460
Now it’s stuck to my finger.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.881
Why can’t you
ever get glitter off your finger?

13:18.964 --> 13:21.717
-That’s a question for “The Why Files.”
-Great question.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.471
I have a question. Why does it look like
a rainbow crashed into our back garden?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.182
We’re having a party for…

13:29.099 --> 13:31.644
Intergalactic Unicorn Day!

13:32.728 --> 13:37.441
Never heard of it. Does it have to have
every colour in the rainbow? And confetti?

13:37.525 --> 13:41.487
The colours are rule number one
for Intergalactic Unicorn Day.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.949
The confetti
is Rosie Rule number one for life.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.117
Rule number two
of Intergalactic Unicorn Day,

13:47.201 --> 13:49.370
you have to have a unicorn picnic outside.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.955
And rule number three,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.791
you have to do a unicorn dance called…

13:53.874 --> 13:56.043
The Unicorn Stampede!

13:59.463 --> 14:01.423
-Hey!
-Oops.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.509
That was kind of fun.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.428
You should come, Arthur.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.932
Yeah. Unicorns love people.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.476
The more, the merrier.
That’s just basic maths.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.772
Maybe. I’m gonna get
some tennis practice in before it rains.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.942
Makes sense.
You wouldn’t want to get caught in the…

14:20.693 --> 14:21.902
Rain?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.488
Look at those clouds.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.367
Well, not all clouds
are rain clouds, right?

14:28.450 --> 14:31.495
-Right. But those are.
-How do you know?

14:31.579 --> 14:34.373
Because those are nimbostratus clouds.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.000
Nimbo-what-us?

14:36.083 --> 14:40.754
Nimbostratus. They’re low, grey
and spread flat across the sky.

14:40.838 --> 14:44.842
When they show up, it usually means
there’s going to be a lot of…

14:46.969 --> 14:49.138
Rain! Quick, pack it up.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.021
Looks like everything’s
still in good shape for the party.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.189
What party?
We can’t have a party in the rain.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.860
Why not? Little known fact about unicorns.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.321
They love the rain.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.405
Or at least I do.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.990
What’s not to love?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.826
I mean, the moisture in the air
forms clouds.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.371
Those turn into rain,
and that’s so amazing.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.166
But our stuff will get all wet,
and so will we.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.421
Maybe there’s a way to have our party
in the rain without getting wet.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.881
We need a brainstorm.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.966
A rainstorm brainstorm!

15:26.550 --> 15:29.470
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

15:29.553 --> 15:32.514
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

15:32.598 --> 15:34.975
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:38.395
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>And try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:40.773
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

15:40.856 --> 15:45.694
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

15:45.778 --> 15:49.406
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

15:49.490 --> 15:50.324
<i>Hey!</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:54.161
What if we made a rain-away machine?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.376
Nice!

16:00.459 --> 16:03.462
But building that might take a while,

16:03.545 --> 16:06.382
and Intergalactic Unicorn Day
will be over.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.175
Then all this would be for nothing.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.010
So we need something else.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.763
We can make a tent out of umbrellas.

16:12.846 --> 16:16.266
But what about the spaces
between the umbrellas?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.143
Definitely too holey.

16:18.227 --> 16:22.523
But we could make a big umbrella tent.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.859
Less holey,
so the rain won’t fall on top of us.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.821
But rain could blow in through the sides.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.447
-Yeah, gotcha.
-True.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.369
We need to build something that covers us.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.079
-Like a shed?
-Yeah!

16:37.162 --> 16:40.457
-That’d work. I’ll start building now.
-Hold your unicorns, Rosie.

16:40.541 --> 16:45.254
We can’t start building yet.
We need to design it first.

16:45.337 --> 16:49.008
You know, think it through,
make a plan, draw it out.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.553
You’re right. I was super excited.
Got way ahead of myself.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.972
And that’s what we love about you.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.893
Maybe a square shed.
Big enough for a Unicorn Stampede.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.063
With a slanted roof. I love how they look.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.231
How’s this?

17:04.314 --> 17:05.858
-Love it.
-Looks great.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.527
So can I build it now?

17:08.610 --> 17:09.611
-Yeah.
-Yup.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.696
Yeah!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.369
After we get our rain gear.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.391
-Amazing.
-Our rain shed is done.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.643
I love it. Let’s test it.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.191
We have a dance floor for the wet ground.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.901
And a picnic blanket.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.779
Looks like we can have a picnic.

17:51.862 --> 17:56.492
Fab! We need to test the walls
to see if they can take a…

17:56.575 --> 17:58.285
Unicorn Stampede!

18:09.630 --> 18:11.173
The walls are caving in.

18:11.256 --> 18:15.427
Quick! Out of the way!
Prance, unicorns, prance!

18:18.847 --> 18:20.516
-Yikes!
-Oh boy.

18:20.599 --> 18:24.103
-Bad news, we need another shed.
-Is there good news?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.562
Puddles!

18:31.276 --> 18:34.363
Guys, I know what we need
for our new shed.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.699
We should put beams up
shaped like an “X,” like that.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.953
They’re called crossbeams.
They’ll support the walls.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.580
My Great Aunt Rose taught me
when we built my dollhouse.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.132
-Yeah!
-Yes!

18:53.215 --> 18:56.343
Now complete with crossbeams
and a stylish flat roof.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.220
I love how they look.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.888
Me too. Let’s test it.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.308
First, picnic.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.477
So far, so good. Roomy and dry.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.689
Next, the Unicorn Stampede dance.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.119
The walls didn’t cave in!

19:25.706 --> 19:26.874
Roof falling.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.500
Can’t move!

19:29.001 --> 19:29.918
Iggy!

19:33.172 --> 19:35.549
Phooey. I really thought
that was going to work.

19:35.632 --> 19:39.219
-I thought so too.
-Let’s dry off and think about this.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.725
We made two sheds,
but neither of them worked.

19:45.559 --> 19:50.314
And if we don’t fix it, we’re gonna miss
Intergalactic Unicorn Day.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.193
Hey, we’re scientists, right?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.194
-Right.
-Yeah.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.529
-And do scientists quit?
-No.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.740
’Cause we’ve got grit!

19:59.823 --> 20:01.617
Grit? Yeah!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.952
-I don’t know if I do.
-You do.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.497
Let’s look at what went wrong
so we can figure out how to make it right.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.501
Hey, now you’re speaking my language.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.462
-Loading the lab.
-Awesome!

20:31.813 --> 20:36.151
Okay, we recreated the sheds.
Let’s check them out.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.612
-On my shed, the walls fell in.
-Right.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.407
And on my shed, the walls stayed up,
but the roof collapsed.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.577
So why didn’t Rosie’s walls cave in?

20:45.661 --> 20:49.456
Maybe ’cause I used crossbeams.
But why did the roof collapse?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.583
Rosie’s roof was flat,

20:52.251 --> 20:57.297
so all the rain collected on top,
then it got too heavy and collapsed.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.926
The slanted roof
was more than just a cool design, Iggy.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.511
It let the water roll off it.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.181
I think I just connected the polka dots.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.559
Both sheds had stuff that worked
and stuff that didn’t,

21:09.643 --> 21:14.022
so what if we build a shed using the walls
from Rosie’s to make it strong

21:14.106 --> 21:16.650
and the roof from Iggy’s
so the water rolls off?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.318
I like that.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.364
Me too. Let’s hurry so we can still enjoy…

21:22.447 --> 21:24.408
Intergalactic Unicorn Day!

21:24.491 --> 21:25.993
-Yeah!
-Let’s do it.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.749
Awesome possum!

21:33.458 --> 21:35.335
-Yes!
-Let’s test it out.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.631
It’s perfect for a picnic.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.427
And now, the moment of truth.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.470
Unicorn Stampede!

21:53.645 --> 21:55.814
Hey, the walls aren’t falling over.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.025
-And the roof is staying put.
-Oh, wow!

21:58.108 --> 22:00.027
Nice! Let’s finish setting up.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.196
Oh no, Rosie.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.657
The rain smudged your painting.

22:06.950 --> 22:11.079
It looks even better.
Unicorns love when colours mix together.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.664
It’s more magical.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.624
Hey, cool shed.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.085
Want to come in, Arthur?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.921
-Sure.
-You need a party hat.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.383
One for you too, Mooshu!

22:24.426 --> 22:28.597
Ada, could you please
pass the rainbow sparkles?

22:31.975 --> 22:35.437
These rainbow sparkles are delicious.
Must be in season.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.860
I could use some… sparkly rainbow juice!

22:45.530 --> 22:48.325
Sparkling rainbow juice is so refreshing.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.035
Mooshu wants some too.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.997
Now, I think it’s time for the…

22:54.081 --> 22:56.541
Unicorn Stampede!

23:06.510 --> 23:10.597
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.146
Hi, I’m Eletrice Harris
and I’m an architect.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.233
Today, I’m gonna show you
one of the houses I designed.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.150
<i>Let’s go!</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:25.195
Any building or structure
that you walk into,

23:25.278 --> 23:27.030
an architect has designed it.

23:27.114 --> 23:31.743
It could be a hospital,
a school, a library, your home.

23:31.827 --> 23:36.623
So for every structure that we design,
we do a set of plans,

23:36.706 --> 23:39.167
and these are called blueprints.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.213
And so the blueprints,
it shows the walls, it shows the windows,

23:43.296 --> 23:44.923
it shows the doors.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.426
We even put in where the toilet should be.

23:49.094 --> 23:53.557
Just like we have skeletons in our body,
buildings have the same thing.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.725
We call this our skeletal frame.

23:57.227 --> 24:00.689
One of the most important things
when building a structure or a house

24:00.772 --> 24:03.316
is to make sure
it will withstand the elements.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.069
The rain, the wind, storms.

24:06.153 --> 24:12.701
So the two structural components that are
important to making a structure sound

24:12.784 --> 24:16.288
are the beams, which are horizontal,

24:16.371 --> 24:18.331
and columns that are vertical.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.543
This is what a doorway
looks like in plan,

24:21.626 --> 24:24.421
and this is what it looks like
when we frame it out.

24:24.504 --> 24:29.050
So this would be our beam
and these are our posts for the doorway.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.472
So here’s a finished product of a doorway.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.851
And if you could imagine
that that beam is across the top

24:37.934 --> 24:39.978
and the posts are along the sides.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.690
Fun fact!

24:43.773 --> 24:45.775
Architecture was a part of the Olympics.

24:45.859 --> 24:50.238
To compete, you had to design
a sports-related structure.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.411
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
