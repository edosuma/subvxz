BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK,

01:54.853 --> 01:57.029
AND PRENTISS IS MAKING IT
SO I CAN TAKE A SABBATICAL.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.814

WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING?

01:58.857 --> 02:01.208
A SYMPOSIUM ON MEDIEVAL
VIOLENCE AND CRIMINOLOGY.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.298

FOR STARTERS,
THE SPECTACLE ELEMENT
IN MEDIEVAL VIOLENCE

02:11.696 --> 02:14.308

CAN I ASK YOU GUYS
A SERIOUS QUESTION?

02:16.005 --> 02:18.312
DO YOU GUYS THINK MAYBE
I SHOULD BE PROVIDING
MORE VISUAL AIDS

02:18.355 --> 02:19.835

HE WOULD HAVE LEFT ONE OF
HER PARENTS ALIVE TO PAY FOR IT.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.329
COULD BE REVENGE. THE DAD
WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

COULD HAVE PISSED OFF
THE WRONG CLIENT.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.247
HE WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO
TAKE A LITTLE GIRL, THOUGH.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.249
WE SHOULD CHECK THE SEX
OFFENDER REGISTRY, RULE OUT

07:47.292 --> 07:48.772
ANY PEDOPHILES IN
THE AREA.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.165
SOMEONE IN THE

BEEN WATCHING HER.

ABSOLUTELY CAN AND SHOULD.

BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
FIT THE PROFILE OF A

GUMPTION TO BREAK INTO A
HOUSE AND KILL PARENTS.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.697
THEY PICK KIDS OFF

TAKE OUT THE FATHER
FIRST, ELIMINATE THE
GREATEST THREAT.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.678

WAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE.

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER BODY.

WALK THROUGH THIS.

GET AWAY FROM THE UNSUB,
TAKES 3 SHOTS.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.882
THIS GUY'S EVEN COLDER
THAN WE THOUGHT.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.275
COLDER

08:57.319 --> 08:59.669
REID: IT IS,
BUT IF OUR UNSUB IS
FAMILIAR WITH THE FAMILY,

08:59.713 --> 09:01.323
WHICH IS
OUR CURRENT THEORY,

09:01.366 --> 09:03.891
THEN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
FOR HIM TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

09:03.934 --> 09:07.416
PERHAPS HIS AIM IS WIDER.
HE COVERS THE BODIES
AS A SIGN OF REMORSE.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.898
BUT HE HAD NO PROBLEM.
HE WATCHED THEM SLEEP

09:10.941 --> 09:13.248
AND THEN PULLED THE
TRIGGER WITHOUT HESITATING.

09:13.291 --> 09:18.470
HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE
WANTED, AND THAT WAS RUBY.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.979
HEY, PRENTISS?
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

09:51.503 --> 09:53.810
SO I LOOKED AT
THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.464
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

09:55.507 --> 09:58.946
TARA TOLD ME THAT
GRACE HAD SOME ISSUES--

09:58.989 --> 10:01.513
MONEY ISSUES,
SPECIFICALLY.

10:02.950 --> 10:07.171

SHOPPING DISORDER.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.961
THIS DRESS ALONE IS WORTH
HALF MY SALARY.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.877
WELL, WE CONSIDERED
THAT THE DAD MIGHT
HAVE HAD ENEMIES.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.487
MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING
AT THE WRONG PARENT.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.968
MAYBE THIS PLAYED
A ROLE IN THE UNSUB
TAKING RUBY.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.970
YEAH, BUT WE'RE STILL
HITTING THE SAME WALL.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.493
WHY TAKE RUBY
OVER THIS?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.974
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
HOW BAD THEIR DEBT WAS.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.540
SO HOW BAD DID IT GET?

10:31.021 --> 10:32.501
OK, GUYS,
SO IT LOOKS LIKE--

10:32.544 --> 10:35.330
AH-AH-AH-AHEM.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.986
LIKE GARCIA HAS SOME
THINGS SHE WANTS TO
TELL YOU.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.684
MM-HMM. I'M ABOUT TO
SAY THE SAME THING
AS LUKE WAS GOING TO,

10:41.728 --> 10:45.296
BUT WITH FAR MORE CHUTZPAH,
WIT, AND ELOQUENCE.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.995
SO, GRACE BUTLER CERTAINLY
DID HAVE A PROBLEM.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.518
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
SHE HAD TIME TO EAT,

10:49.561 --> 10:50.824
LET ALONE NEED MONEY TO EAT.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.390
THESE VALENTINO GARAVANI
SHOES SHE BOUGHT--

10:52.434 --> 10:54.001
HOLY CANNOLI!
NOT CHEAP.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.524
THEY WERE ON THEIR
THIRD MORTGAGE,

10:55.567 --> 10:57.613
AND THEY CLEANED OUT
KELLAN'S 401.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.833
WELL, MAYBE THE BUTLERS
BORROWED MONEY FROM THE
WRONG PEOPLE

10:59.876 --> 11:01.356
AND THAT GOT THEM KILLED.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.705
ALVEZ: WE DOUBLE-CHECKED
THAT.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.403
THE LOANS THEY TOOK OUT
WERE ALL ABOVE-BOARD.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.536
THE BANKS MIGHT HAVE
SHREDDED THE BUTLERS'
CREDIT RATING,

11:07.579 --> 11:09.016
BUT THAT'S IT.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.539
AND J.J. AND I
DOUBLE-CHECKED
THE INTERVIEWS

11:10.582 --> 11:12.019
OF EVERY PERSON
IN THIS TOWN.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.543
NO ONE HAD THE MEANS,
MOTIVE, OR OPPORTUNITY
FOR THIS.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.110
PRENTISS: OK, THEN, WE'RE
GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.982
LET'S RETHINK THIS CASE
THROUGH THE PROFILE
OF A STRANGER.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.028
FIRST PRINCIPLE--
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

11:21.071 --> 11:23.378
NO FORCED ENTRY,
SO HE DIDN'T BREAK IN.

11:23.421 --> 11:26.033
MAYBE HE HAD A KEY,
OR HE KNEW WHICH WINDOW
WAS VULNERABLE.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.645
BUT HE KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE KELLAN, GRACE,
AND RUBY WERE IN THE HOUSE.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.039
ROSSI:
HIS AGENDA WAS PRECISE.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.345
THAT'S RIGHT. SO, WHAT
DOES THIS UNSUB DO?

11:34.389 --> 11:37.784
BEFORE HE KILLS,
BEFORE HE ABDUCTS,
WHAT DOES HE DO?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.350
HE WATCHES.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.570
PRENTISS: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WATCHES, HE STUDIES,
HE WAITS.

11:41.613 --> 11:45.052
NEXT PRINCIPLE--
WHILE HE'S WATCHING,
WHAT DOES HE SEE?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.054
SIMMONS: BOXES...
COMING TO THE HOUSE.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.056
PROBABLY THE HUSBAND
AND WIFE FIGHTING
OVER THEM.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.058
YEAH, SO MAYBE THAT'S
WHY HE TOOK RUBY.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.016
HE THINKS HE'S
SAVING HER.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.062
LEWIS: BUT THEN HE
WOULDN'T JUST WATCH FROM
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.064
I MEAN, HE WOULD SURVEIL
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.502
HE WOULD BUILD A CASE
TO JUSTIFY GOING
TO THIS EXTREME.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.722
PRENTISS: AND HE DID.
WE NEED TO DO THE
SAME THING.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.594
I WANT A FULL BREAKDOWN
OF THIS FAMILY'S HABITS
AND ROUTINES,

12:05.637 --> 12:08.640
BECAUSE EVERYWHERE
THEY WENT, THIS
UNSUB WENT, TOO.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.211
CAN I HELP YOU?

12:14.255 --> 12:16.823
AGENTS PRENTISS
AND ROSSI WITH THE FBI.
ARE YOU THE MANAGER?

12:16.866 --> 12:19.869
I AM. IS THIS
ABOUT THE BUTLERS?

12:19.913 --> 12:22.611
YES, IT IS. WE'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH THEIR
CREDIT CARD HISTORY,

12:22.654 --> 12:24.091
AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
THEY CAME HERE A LOT?

12:24.134 --> 12:26.615
THEY DID.
WELL, GRACE DID.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.748
SHE'D COME HERE
ABOUT 3 TIMES A WEEK.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.708
SHE'D GET A CUP OF COFFEE
AND SOMETIMES A GINGERBREAD MAN
TO TAKE FOR HER DAUGHTER.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.624
WERE THERE OTHER CUSTOMERS
WHO WOULD COME IN
AT THE SAME TIME?

12:35.667 --> 12:39.933
I MEAN, I'D HAVE TO GO
THROUGH MY RECEIPTS,
BUT MAYBE.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.936
GIRL, CRYING: EXCUSE ME?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.285
RUBY?

12:44.328 --> 12:47.941
HE SAYS YOU'RE
MY MOMMY NOW.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.638
PRENTISS: RUBY.
OHH!

12:49.681 --> 12:51.814
DAVE, OUTSIDE!
CAN YOU TAKE HER?

13:00.301 --> 13:01.911
PRENTISS:
WE JUST RECOVERED
RUBY BUTLER.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.740
I NEED A LOCKDOWN
FOR A 1-MILE RADIUS.
HE JUST DROPPED HER OFF.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.047
NOTHING. NO ONE
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.
HE'S GONE.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.483
OF COURSE HE IS.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.833
HE MADE SURE SHE WAS SAFE,
AND THEN HE JUST TOOK OFF

13:10.877 --> 13:13.270
BECAUSE HE PLANNED
FOR THIS, TOO.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.712
LEWIS IS MEETING
THE AMBULANCE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.410
SHE'LL LET US KNOW
IF RUBY WAKES UP.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.673
POOR KID DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE HER PARENTS TO
SIT BY HER BED.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.022
AT LEAST SHE'S GOT TARA.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.676
NO PHYSICAL
OR SEXUAL TRAUMA.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.809
IT'S WHAT SHE SURVIVED
THAT OVERWHELMED HER.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.158
AND YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE UNSUB.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.855
HE THINKS HE'S
SAVING HER.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.683
W-WHAT DID HE
MAKE HER SAY?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.424
YOU'RE MY MOMMY NOW.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.166
HE DEEMED THE BUTLERS
AS UNWORTHY, AND THEN
PUT RUBY WITH SOMEONE

13:39.209 --> 13:43.170
HE THINKS DESERVES HER,
LIKE HER.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.694
SHE'S LOOKING TO SEE
IF ANY OF HER CUSTOMERS
MIGHT BE THE UNSUB, BUT--

13:45.737 --> 13:47.391
OH, WE WON'T BE
THAT LUCKY.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.698
HE PAID WITH CASH.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.352
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.397
YEAH, I KNOW.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.921
HE'S ON A MISSION.

13:54.964 --> 13:58.576
HE'S NOT DRIVEN BY
URGES OR COMPULSIONS,

13:58.620 --> 14:00.970
AND THE PROFILE TELLS US
THAT MEN LIKE THIS...

14:01.014 --> 14:02.711
THEY DON'T HAVE
A COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.408
HE MIGHT STOP WITH RUBY.

14:04.452 --> 14:08.369
HE MIGHT, EXCEPT HE DID
EVERYTHING HE WANTED
AND GOT AWAY CLEAN.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.588
MY GUT SAYS HE'S
WATCHING OTHER FAMILIES.

14:10.632 --> 14:14.201
AND GOD HELP THEM
IF HE THINKS THEY'RE
FAILING THEIR KIDS.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.563
NAOMI...RUN!

14:57.461 --> 15:00.464
WOMAN, OVER P.A.: DR. HOUSTON...

15:00.508 --> 15:02.031
HE KILLED ANOTHER COUPLE?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.859
PRENTISS: LAST NIGHT.
CARTER AND JULIE SHAW.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.382
WERE ANY KIDS TAKEN?

15:05.426 --> 15:08.168
THEIR DAUGHTER NAOMI.
SAME AGE AS RUBY.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.387
WELL, IF HE STICKS
TO PATTERN,

15:10.431 --> 15:13.347
HE'S PROBABLY GONNA TRY
TO REHOME HER, LIKE HE
DID WITH JAYNE.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.002
BUT WHY JAYNE? I MEAN,
HOW DOES HE MAKE
THAT DECISION?

15:16.045 --> 15:19.048
HE LIKES TO WATCH.
HE WATCHED JAYNE
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE

15:19.092 --> 15:20.528
AT HER CAFE.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.704
TO OUR UNSUB, SHE'S
A MORE DESERVING MOM.

15:22.747 --> 15:26.360
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
JAYNE WANTED TO COME
DOWN AND CHECK ON RUBY,

15:26.403 --> 15:30.712
AND I HAD KIND OF
AN UNUSUAL IDEA ABOUT HOW
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.367
OK, KEEP ME POSTED,
BUT WE NEED TO RESET
THE CLOCK ON NAOMI.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.759
SHE HAS TO BE
OUR FOCUS NOW.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.761
YEAH. WILL DO.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.945
[WOMAN SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.]

15:57.086 --> 15:59.262
WHY WOULD
SOMEBODY DO THIS?

15:59.306 --> 16:02.439
TO A LITTLE GIRL?

16:04.093 --> 16:06.356
YOU GUYS SAID THIS MAN
CAME INTO MY SHOP,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.924
AND I HAVE BEEN RACKING
MY BRAIN TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHO IT IS,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.926
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.060
ALL MY REGULARS--
THEY'RE NICE.

16:14.103 --> 16:18.412
THIS IS A NICE TOWN,
AND WE ARE NICE PEOPLE.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.980
WE DON'T DO THINGS
LIKE THIS HERE.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.027
DID YOU BRING
WHAT I ASKED?

16:25.071 --> 16:26.986
I DID.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.120
I DON'T GET IT,
BUT...

16:31.164 --> 16:35.429
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE,
BUT OF ALL OF THE 5 SENSES,

16:35.472 --> 16:37.431
THE SENSE OF SMELL
IS THE MOST POWERFUL,

16:37.474 --> 16:39.433
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO MEMORIES.

16:39.476 --> 16:43.437
IT CAN AWAKEN THE SUBCONSCIOUS
AND, IN CERTAIN RARE CASES,

16:43.480 --> 16:46.483
EVEN AWAKEN THE UNCONSCIOUS.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.311
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.009
YEAH.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.448
OH! THAT'S STILL WARM.

16:54.491 --> 16:58.452
THEY WERE HER FAVORITE,
HER MOM SAID.

16:58.495 --> 17:02.456
SO, WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

17:02.499 --> 17:04.023
WE WAIT.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.030
UHH...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.687
LEWIS: HEY, RUBY,
YOU SMELL THAT?

17:19.690 --> 17:22.650
HI.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.086
YOU'RE SAFE.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.655
WHERE'S MOMMY?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.008
REID: WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
SO HARD AT THE FAMILIES,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.837
THAT WE MISSED THE MOST
OBVIOUS CONNECTION--
GENETICS.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.491
BUT THE FAMILIES
AREN'T RELATED.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.493
YOU'VE NO IDEA
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.016
TAKE KELLAN
AND GRACE BUTLER.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.844
BOTH OF RUBY'S PARENTS
HAVE GREEN EYES.

17:42.887 --> 17:46.456
RUBY ALSO HAS GREEN EYES,
BUT ONE OF HER EYES HAS
SOME SHADINGS TO IT.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.502
IT'S A RESULT OF A CONDITION
CALLED HETEROCHROMIA.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.504
IT'S GENETIC, AND NEITHER
PARENT SHARES IT.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.507
SO I KEPT DIGGING,
AND THE SHAW FAMILY
TELLS A SIMILAR STORY.

17:53.550 --> 17:56.379
SPECIFICALLY,
THE DAUGHTER'S BLOOD TYPE
MATCHES NEITHER PARENT.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.513
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE BLOOD TYPES WOULD
HAVE TO BE SHARED UNLESS...

17:59.556 --> 18:01.167
UNLESS THEY'RE NOT RELATED.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.517
THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION
IS THAT BOTH THE
GIRLS ARE ADOPTED.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.040
ROSSI: WHY DIDN'T
GARCIA FIND THIS?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.868
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
TO LOOK FOR IT.
IT'S A SMALL TOWN.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.349
PERHAPS THE PARENTS
DON'T WANT THE DAUGHTERS
TO FEEL LIKE OUTSIDERS.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.568
BUT SOMEHOW THIS
UNSUB KNEW THIS.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.528
THAT'S THE COMPULSION
THAT'S DRIVING HIM.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.357
HE'S SAVING ADOPTED
8-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.186
WE NEED TO DELIVER
THE PROFILE.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.624
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MALE
IN HIS LATE 20s TO EARLY 30s.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.061
HE'S INTELLIGENT,
PHYSICALLY FIT, AND METICULOUS,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.063
BORDERING ON
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.544
WE BELIEVE THIS UNSUB
IS ABDUCTING 8-YEAR-OLD
ADOPTED GIRLS

18:30.587 --> 18:32.198
IN AN EFFORT
TO REHOME THEM.

18:32.241 --> 18:35.070
NOW, AN AGENDA
THIS SPECIFIC TELLS US
SOME THINGS ABOUT HIM.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.204
FIRST, WE BELIEVE
THE UNSUB WAS CLOSELY
AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTED

18:38.247 --> 18:40.380
BY THE ADOPTION SYSTEM.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.382
IT'S POSSIBLE HE HIMSELF
WAS ADOPTED.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.559
AT LAST COUNT,
16% OF ALL SERIAL KILLERS
INTERVIEWED BY THE BAU

18:45.602 --> 18:46.821
WERE ADOPTED.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.215
BUT CONSIDERING THE
COMPASSION HE SHOWED RUBY,

18:49.258 --> 18:53.175
WE THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY
HE PUT A CHILD UP
FOR ADOPTION HIMSELF.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.569
ROSSI: HIS DAUGHTER WAS SUBJECT
TO REAL OR PERCEIVED HARM

18:55.612 --> 18:58.615
AT THE HANDS OF
HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.750
IN ORDER TO TARGET
RUBY AND NAOMI,

19:02.793 --> 19:06.580
WE THINK THE UNSUB IS
WORKING INSIDE THE
ADOPTION SYSTEM,

19:06.623 --> 19:09.409
SO THIS IS THE FIRST SUSPECT
POOL WE NEED TO RULE OUT.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.585
REID: IF OUR UNSUB STICKS
TO HIS MISSION-ORIENTED PLAN,

19:11.628 --> 19:13.195
HE WILL ATTEMPT TO
REHOME NAOMI,

19:13.239 --> 19:16.111
MOST LIKELY WITH SOMEONE
THAT'S FAMILIAR
TO THE SHAW FAMILY.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.594
IF WE CAN IDENTIFY
THIS FRIEND, FAMILY, OR
STRANGER HE CHOOSES FOR NAOMI,

19:20.637 --> 19:22.117
WE CAN GET AHEAD OF HIM.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.119
PRENTISS: WE WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP THE MEDIA STRATEGY

19:24.163 --> 19:26.121
AS TIGHTLY CONTROLLED
AS POSSIBLE.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.949
REID: UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN
INFORMATION WAS RELEASED

19:27.992 --> 19:29.777
ABOUT THE GREEN RIVER
KILLER'S DUMP SITES,

19:29.820 --> 19:32.127
THE KILLER SAW
THE NEWS COVERAGE,
CHANGED HIS M.O.,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.129
AND IT SET THE
INVESTIGATION BACK WEEKS.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.958
OUR BEST BET TO SAVE NAOMI
AND CAPTURE THE UNSUB

19:37.001 --> 19:39.221
IS TO MAKE SURE
HE STICKS TO PLAN.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.136
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.619
EVERYTHING GOOD?

19:45.662 --> 19:48.709
BETTER THAN THAT.
RUBY'S TALKING.

19:48.752 --> 19:52.060
SO YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
THE MAN WHO TOOK YOU, BUT...

19:52.103 --> 19:54.715
YOU SAID HE WAS KIND OF TALL?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.630
ALL RIGHT.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.545
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE SAID TO YOU?

19:58.588 --> 20:02.157
HE SAID I HAD TO
WEAR THE DRESS.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.640
I COULDN'T GET IT DIRTY
OR TAKE IT OFF.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.164
AND I HAD TO
SAY THAT THING.

20:10.513 --> 20:13.516
"YOU'RE MY MOMMY NOW"?
THAT THING?

20:15.039 --> 20:19.653
OK. WELL, THE POLICE
HAVE THE DRESS NOW.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.612
AND, RUBY, EVERYTHING
YOU TOLD ME...

20:22.656 --> 20:24.353
IS REALLY HELPFUL.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.137
IS IT MY FAULT?

20:26.181 --> 20:29.663
OH. OH, SWEETIE, NO.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.969
NO. LISTEN...

20:32.013 --> 20:34.189
NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.192
YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL,
AND YOU'RE PERFECT.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.673
YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.328
THE MAN WHO DID THIS--
IT'S HIS FAULT.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.199
ALL OF IT.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.464
SO NOW, YOUR ONLY JOB
IS TO GET BETTER

20:48.508 --> 20:51.989
AND NOT TO WORRY,
BECAUSE IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT YOU.

20:52.033 --> 20:56.603
AND I PROMISE I WON'T
LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU

20:56.646 --> 21:00.215
TILL YOUR GRAMMY AND GRANDPA
ARRIVE FROM FLORIDA.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.695
OK?

21:01.738 --> 21:03.262
OK.

21:04.567 --> 21:09.224
WILL YOU STAY WITH ME
UNTIL THEY COME?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.747
OF COURSE.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.844
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS COULD
HAVE HAPPENED.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.716
YEAH. NEITHER DO WE,
MR. KRANUM.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.545
THAT'S WHY WE ASKED YOU
TO COME DOWN HERE.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.374
YOU EXAMINED THE SHAWS,
IS THAT RIGHT?

21:28.417 --> 21:31.551
YES. I MEAN,
THAT'S MY JOB
AS A SOCIAL WORKER.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.335
I MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS SAFE

21:33.379 --> 21:35.032
AND APPROPRIATE
FOR A CHILD,

21:35.076 --> 21:38.558
AND THEN I MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION
FOR ADOPTION PLACEMENT,

21:38.601 --> 21:40.690
AND THE SHAWS
CHECKED EVERY BOX.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.214
THEY WERE WONDERFUL
PROSPECTIVE PARENTS.

21:43.258 --> 21:46.348
THE MAN WHO'S KILLING
THESE FAMILIES,

21:46.392 --> 21:49.525
HE KNOWS THE KIND
OF INTIMATE DETAILS

21:49.569 --> 21:52.267
YOU WOULD UNCOVER
AS PART OF YOUR JOB.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.356
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE
IN YOUR FIELD

21:54.400 --> 21:55.662
WHO WOULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THAT?

21:55.705 --> 21:57.446
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.840
WE'RE THE FIRST
AND LAST LINE
OF DEFENSE.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.233
THESE KIDS DEPEND
ON US.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.105
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.630
ALL RIGHT.
SO THE FIRST TIME

22:07.674 --> 22:10.938
THAT WE WALKED THIS,
WE THOUGHT DAD FELL
ASLEEP ON THE COUCH,

22:10.981 --> 22:12.809
WATCHING "SPORTSCENTER"
OR SOMETHING,

22:12.853 --> 22:14.376
AND MOM WENT TO BED.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.900
YEAH, WHICH IS
OFF PATTERN
FOR OUR UNSUB.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.294
HE SHOULD HAVE WAITED
TILL THEY WERE TOGETHER
IN BED ASLEEP.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.904
HE'D HAVE MORE CONTROL.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.167
WELL, I THINKING THAT
HE DIDN'T WAIT
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.952
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

22:24.995 --> 22:28.129
CHANGE OF CLOTHES,
SUIT AND TIE.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.957
THERE'S A TOOTHBRUSH
AND TOOTHPASTE

22:30.000 --> 22:31.785
IN THE GUEST BATHROOM.

22:31.828 --> 22:36.093
NOW I'VE HAD FRIENDS
WHO HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT
OF BED ENOUGH TIMES

22:36.137 --> 22:38.269
TO KNOW WHAT
THAT LOOKS LIKE.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.881
I THINK THAT CARTER SHAW
WAS RIDING THE COUCH.

22:40.924 --> 22:45.146
OK. SO THE SHAWS WERE
HAVING MARITAL PROBLEMS.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.670
THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO
RESCUE NAOMI.

22:47.714 --> 22:50.151
RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY
THIS MAKES OUR PROFILE
EVEN MORE COMPLICATED,

22:50.194 --> 22:52.632
AND THE GUY--
THE HOME INSPECTOR
YOU JUST TALKED TO--

22:52.675 --> 22:55.852
HE WOULDN'T KNOW THIS
OR SHOPPING ADDICTION.

22:55.896 --> 23:00.030
SO MAYBE THE UNSUB's
JOB IN THE ADOPTION
SYSTEM IS JUST

23:00.074 --> 23:01.945
HIS WAY IN,

23:01.989 --> 23:04.426
BUT WHEN HE PICKS
A FAMILY,

23:04.470 --> 23:06.602
HE DOESN'T STOP
UNTIL HE FEELS
JUSTIFIED

23:06.646 --> 23:07.995
IN KILLING THEM.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.649
HEY. WE'VE GONE THROUGH
ALL THE SOCIAL WORKERS.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.694
THEY'RE CLEAN.
WHAT OTHER LEADS
DO WE HAVE

23:11.738 --> 23:13.174
INSIDE THE ADOPTION
SYSTEM?

23:13.217 --> 23:14.958
GARCIA: IT'S KIND OF A SLOG.
THERE IS A LOT

23:15.002 --> 23:16.307
OF STUFF TO CONSIDER.

23:16.351 --> 23:17.570
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
DID YOU KNOW THAT

23:17.613 --> 23:19.963
THERE IS A HOME DECORATOR
FOR POTENTIAL PARENTS?

23:20.007 --> 23:21.922
THAT IS A THING.
IT'S NOT A THING

23:21.965 --> 23:23.445
WE NEED TO LOOK INTO
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T THINK,

23:23.489 --> 23:24.707
BUT IT'S A THING.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.056
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A FULL PLATE,

23:26.100 --> 23:27.623
BUT THERE'S ONE
OTHER SEARCH
WE NEED.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.059
OH, NO. PUT ALL
THE THINGS ON THE PLATE.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.931
I DO WAY BETTER WHEN I'M
OVERWHELMED. HIT ME.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.759
THE SHAWS
AND THE BUTLERS
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

23:32.802 --> 23:34.108
HIS FIRST VICTIMS.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.936
THE UNSUB MIGHT
HAVE KILLED THE PARENTS

23:35.979 --> 23:38.591
WHO ADOPTED HIS OWN
DAUGHTER FIRST.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.288
SIR, I THINK OUR MINDS
MAY HAVE MELDED

23:40.331 --> 23:41.768
BECAUSE I ALREADY
LOOKED INTO THAT,

23:41.811 --> 23:43.465
AND THERE'S NO VIOLENCE
IN ANY OF THE ADOPTION FILES

23:43.509 --> 23:45.075
THAT I PULLED IN STATE.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.337
WELL, IT WAS WORTH
A SHOT.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.601
IT STILL COULD BE.
MAYBE HE DID IT IN A WAY

23:48.644 --> 23:49.906
THAT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
THE OTHER MURDERS.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.126
YOU MEAN, LIKE
AN ACCIDENT?

23:52.169 --> 23:53.736
YOU THINK OF ALL THE THINGS,
EMILY PRENTISS.

23:53.780 --> 23:54.998
THIS IS WHY.
YOU'RE A BOSS LADY.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.217
I WILL HIT YOU
RIGHT BA--

23:57.871 --> 23:59.307
PRENTISS: GARCIA?

23:59.350 --> 24:00.917
SITTING OUTSIDE
OF KALDI COFFEE...

24:00.961 --> 24:02.484
GARCIA: TURN ON THE TV.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.878
UH, PLYMOUTH LOCAL NEWS.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.314
REPORTER: A MS. JAYNE ARCHER.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.358
WE'LL SEE IF SHE'S
AVAILABLE TODAY--

24:07.402 --> 24:08.751
MAN: THERE SHE IS!

24:08.795 --> 24:10.057
JAYNE ARCHER, WHY DID
THE KILLER LEAVE

24:10.100 --> 24:11.624
RUBY BUTLER WITH YOU?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.016
REPORTER TWO: WE
HEARD RUBY'S STILL
IN THE HOSPITAL

24:13.060 --> 24:14.191
AND THAT THE FBI's
INVOLVED IN THE CASE.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.802
ARE YOU GONNA VISIT HER?

24:15.845 --> 24:17.064
MS. ARCHER,
DO YOU KNOW
THE SECOND GIRL

24:17.107 --> 24:18.718
WHO'S BEEN TAKEN--
NAOMI SHAW?

24:18.761 --> 24:20.023
JAYNE: NO. PLEASE JUST--

24:20.067 --> 24:22.156
THEY JUST REVEALED
THAT JAYNE DOESN'T
HAVE RUBY

24:22.199 --> 24:23.505
LIKE HE PLANNED.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.333
IF THE UNSUB
SEES THIS,
HE'LL DEVOLVE.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.336
THEY MIGHT HAVE JUST
GOTTEN NAOMI KILLED.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.468
ALL RIGHT.
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.339
JAYNE ARCHER IS
NOT BUDGING--

24:40.566 --> 24:43.264
NO, NO, NO!

24:54.275 --> 24:58.497
HEY.
OH. HEY.

24:58.540 --> 25:02.239
I'VE SEEN THAT
THOUSAND-YARD
STARE BEFORE.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.764
WELL, ALL THIS WORK,
IT ALL GOES
DOWN THE TOILET

25:04.807 --> 25:07.897
ONCE WE'RE
ON THE 6:00 NEWS.

25:07.941 --> 25:11.074
YEAH. I HEARD
SOMEONE HAD THEIR
WEDDING PROPOSAL

25:11.118 --> 25:12.728
SHOT TO HELL.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.862
YEAH. THAT DIDN'T GO
QUITE ACCORDING TO PLAN.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.038
SORRY.

25:18.081 --> 25:21.563
I'M JUST TRYING
TO CHEER YOU UP.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.392
GO AHEAD. I KNOW
YOU WANT TO SAY IT.

25:24.435 --> 25:28.657
OH. SO IF YOU MARRY
YOUR THIRD WIFE
FOR THE SECOND TIME,

25:28.701 --> 25:30.790
WHAT COLOR IS
THE DRESS FOR THAT?

25:30.833 --> 25:33.923
HEH. I ADMIT I'VE
BEEN WONDERING
THAT MYSELF.

25:33.967 --> 25:37.753
HEH HEH. SO HOW ARE
YOU GONNA PROPOSE?

25:37.797 --> 25:39.886
I DON'T KNOW.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.584
I JUST WANT IT
TO BE PERFECT.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.194
WELL, DON'T WAIT
TOO LONG.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.066
YOU KNOW
THAT OLD SAYING--

25:46.109 --> 25:49.112
MAN PLANS,
SERIAL KILLERS LAUGH.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.551
HEY, GUYS.
WE GOT SOMETHING.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.645
GARCIA GOT A HIT
ON A ROBERT
AND ALICE CARSON

25:59.688 --> 26:01.081
MURDERED 2 1/2
WEEKS AGO,

26:01.124 --> 26:02.735
SHOT IN THEIR CAR
AND ACROSS
STATE LINES.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.606
DIFFERENT M.O.,
DIFFERENT JURISDICTION.

26:04.650 --> 26:05.955
HOW DO WE KNOW THEY'RE
TIED TO THIS CASE.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.609
BECAUSE THERE'S
A SOCIAL MEDIA PHOTO

26:07.653 --> 26:09.045
OF THEIR ADOPTED
DAUGHTER

26:09.089 --> 26:12.483
WEARING THE EXACT DRESS
THAT RUBY WORE.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.790
THIS IS ASHLEY CARSON,
8 YEARS OLD.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.619
RUBY AND NAOMI
MUST BE SURROGATES
FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.881
WHAT HAPPENED TO ASHLEY?

26:18.925 --> 26:21.318
ASHLEY DIED LAST YEAR.
CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.755
SHE COLLAPSED AT HOME.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.757
THERE WAS NO WAY
ANYONE COULD
HAVE KNOWN.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.106
BUT THAT WOULDN'T MATTER
TO OUR UNSUB.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.542
HE'D HOLD THE PARENTS
ACCOUNTABLE ANYWAY.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.239
WE NEED THAT
BIRTH FATHER'S NAME.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.632
GARCIA'S SEARCHING
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW,

26:30.676 --> 26:32.503
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE ADOPTION RECORD.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.940
WELL, THERE MUST BE
A REASON FOR THAT.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.072
WHO FACILITATED
THE ADOPTION?

26:36.116 --> 26:37.900
UH, FRIENDS AND FAMILIES
ADOPTION CENTER.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.381
THEIR OWN SCOTT TRUMAN,
HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE NOW.

26:44.777 --> 26:47.257
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

26:47.301 --> 26:52.567
HOME. WE'RE GOING
HOME, ASHLEY.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.395
CAN YOU GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO EAT, DADDY?

26:54.438 --> 26:56.658
I'M HUNGRY.

26:56.702 --> 27:00.183
NAOMI: PLEASE, MISTER.
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.067
THANKS.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.220
UNSUB: YOU WANT PEANUTS
OR ALMONDS?

27:37.264 --> 27:39.092
NAOMI: I'M ALLERGIC.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.137
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.748
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.668
UNSUB: AHEM. HEY.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.509
HEY. DID THE CELTICS
WIN TODAY?

28:05.553 --> 28:07.163
YEAH. WE MISSED THE GAME.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.823
UH, YEAH, BY, UH,
18 POINTS, I THINK.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.440
CELTICS DIDN'T PLAY TODAY.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.833
ASHLEY, GO WAIT
IN THE CAR.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.966
MY NAME'S NOT--GET IN THE CAR, ASHLEY!

28:30.796 --> 28:32.362
HEY, MAN.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.940
I TOLD YOU TO GET
IN THE CAR.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.863
ROBERT AND ALICE CARSON?

28:54.907 --> 28:57.605
THEY WERE SHOT
IN THEIR CAR
TWO WEEKS AGO.

28:57.648 --> 29:01.000
SO YOU REMEMBER THEM?

29:01.043 --> 29:03.567
OF COURSE.

29:03.611 --> 29:06.745
I HELPED PLACE
ASHLEY WITH THEM.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.964
THEN WHEN ASHLEY DIED,
I WENT TO HER FUNERAL.

29:11.053 --> 29:14.709
THEY HAD ONE
OF THOSE VIDEOS
OF HER LIFE, YOU KNOW?

29:14.753 --> 29:15.971
THEY STILL HAVE
THE WEB SITE UP

29:16.015 --> 29:18.582
SO NOBODY WOULD
FORGET HER. AHEM.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.802
WHO WERE ASHLEY'S
BIRTH PARENTS?

29:20.846 --> 29:23.762
THE FATHER'S A SUSPECT
IN A SERIES OF MURDERS.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.502
ASHLEY WAS VOLUNTARILY
SURRENDERED TO THE HOSPITAL

29:25.546 --> 29:27.504
BY HER MOTHER.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.289
SHE CLAIMED THE FATHER
WAS DEAD

29:29.332 --> 29:31.726
AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED
THAT ALL DETAILS BE
KEPT CONFIDENTIAL.

29:34.381 --> 29:37.471
YOU CAN CHECK
WITH THE HOSPITAL, BUT--

29:37.514 --> 29:41.301
ALL RIGHT.
I'M ON IT.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.520
THERE'S ANOTHER THEORY
THAT WE'RE PURSUING.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.261
IS THERE ANYONE
IN YOUR COMPANY
THAT COULD ACCESS

29:45.305 --> 29:47.786
THE ADOPTION RECORDS,
SPECIFICALLY THE LIVES

29:47.829 --> 29:49.352
OF THE FAMILIES
WHO ADOPT?

29:49.396 --> 29:53.226
WELL, NO,
BUT...WHEN YOU CALLED

29:53.269 --> 29:56.707
ABOUT THE CARSONS,
I BROUGHT THEIR
ADOPTION APPLICATION.

29:56.751 --> 30:00.189
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT HELPS, BUT...

30:00.233 --> 30:01.625
WHAT IS THIS?

30:01.669 --> 30:03.366
IT'S CALLED
A LOOK BOOK.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.064
IT'S, FOR LACK
OF A BETTER WORD,
A SALES TOOL

30:05.107 --> 30:07.457
SO PROSPECTIVE PARENTS
CAN LOOK APPEALING
TO BIRTH MOMS.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.763
THE CARSONS PUT
THEIR WHOLE HOUSE ON HERE,

30:08.807 --> 30:10.460
THEIR FRONT YARD,
THEIR BACKYARD,

30:10.504 --> 30:12.027
DOORS, WINDOWS,
EVERYTHING.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.724
IS THAT IMPORTANT?

30:13.768 --> 30:15.030
THE UNSUB STALKS
HIS VICTIMS.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.859
I THINK HE USES THIS
AS THE ROADMAP TO DO IT.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.688
OK. SO THE BUTLERS
AND THE SHAWS EACH USED

30:20.731 --> 30:22.733
DIFFERENT ADOPTION
COMPANIES,

30:22.777 --> 30:24.866
BUT THOSE COMPANIES
FREELANCED OUT
THE LOOK BOOKS.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.346
YEAH, AND WOULDN'T
YOU KNOW IT?

30:26.389 --> 30:28.870
THE SAME INDEPENDENT
CONTRACTOR JORDAN HALLORAN

30:28.914 --> 30:30.219
MADE BOTH LOOK BOOKS.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.221
PRENTISS: WE NEED HIS HOME
AND WORK ADDRESS.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.093
OH, OH. HOLD UP.
HE'S NOT GONNA BE
AT EITHER PLACE.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.746
HE'S ON THE MOVE.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.878
JUST GOT A REPORT
OF A MURDER
AT A CONVENIENCE STORE

30:36.922 --> 30:38.227
OUTSIDE OF CAMPTON.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.402
THE GUNMAN HAS
THAT LITTLE GIRL WITH HIM.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.882
REID: THAT'S
DEFINITELY NAOMI.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.405
HE CHANGED HER HAIR
AND PUT HER
IN THE DRESS.

30:42.449 --> 30:43.885
HE'S NOT TRYING TO
REHOME HER ANYMORE.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.539
HE'S TRYING TO
REMAKE HER
INTO ASHLEY.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.933
HIS DEVOLUTION COULD BE
A DISSOCIATIVE BREAK.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.238
AND CAMPTON ISN'T
NEAR HIM.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.631
WHERE'S HE HEADED?

30:50.674 --> 30:51.719
OK. LET'S GO BACK
TO THE BEGINNING

30:51.762 --> 30:53.242
THROUGH HIS POINT
OF VIEW.

30:53.286 --> 30:56.289
ASHLEY WAS A SURRENDER
AT THE HOSPITAL
AGAINST HIS WILL,

30:56.332 --> 30:59.248
SO HE GOT INTO
THE ADOPTION SYSTEM.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.294
JAREAU: MADE THE LOOK BOOKS
IN ORDER TO HUNT

31:01.337 --> 31:02.556
FOR HIS OWN DAUGHTER.

31:02.599 --> 31:03.774
THE LOOK BOOKS LED
HIM TO THE CARSONS,

31:03.818 --> 31:05.341
THE BUTLERS,
AND THE SHAWS.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.690
THEY ALL HAD
LITTLE GIRLS THAT
COULD BE HIS DAUGHTER.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.040
SIMMONS: WHEN ASHLEY DIES,
THAT SETS HIM OFF.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.519
HE HAS TO RESCUE
THE OTHERS.

31:09.563 --> 31:12.000
THAT PLAN'S NOT
WORKING ANYMORE
THANKS TO THE MEDIA.

31:12.044 --> 31:15.090
NOW HE SEES NAOMI
AS ASHLEY.

31:15.134 --> 31:17.136
HE WANTS HIS DAUGHTER BACK,
BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.442
HE WANTS
HIS OLD LIFE BACK,

31:19.486 --> 31:22.445
THE LIFE HE WASN'T ABLE
TO LEAD WHEN SHE WAS BORN.

31:22.489 --> 31:25.796
THE WHITE PICKET FENCE,
THE LOVING WIFE,
THE FAMILY UNIT.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.798
THE BIRTH MOTHER.
THAT'S THE MISSING PIECE.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.888
JAREAU: I JUST GOT THAT
INFORMATION FROM THE HOSPITAL.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.063
PRENTISS: THAT'S WHERE
HE'S HEADING NEXT.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.934
HE'S EITHER GONNA
IDEALIZE HER

31:32.978 --> 31:35.545
AND MAKE HER
THE MOTHER HE WANTS,
OR HE'S GONNA KILL HER.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.938
OK. BECKY HUGHES.
SHE'S THE MOM.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.461
OK. WE NEED TO GET
TO HER BEFORE HE DOES.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.382
HELLO?

31:46.426 --> 31:48.645
HI, MOMMY.

31:48.689 --> 31:52.954
WHAT

31:52.998 --> 31:55.739
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD
ME TO SAY.

31:55.783 --> 31:59.700
WHO? WHO TOLD YOU
TO SAY?

31:59.743 --> 32:01.310
HI, BECKY.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.312
JORDAN?

32:03.356 --> 32:05.836
WHAT ARE YOU--

32:05.880 --> 32:07.360
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

32:07.403 --> 32:09.797
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.320
THIS IS OUR HOME NOW.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.974
WHAT?!

32:13.018 --> 32:15.977
YOU, ME, AND ASHLEY.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.979
WE'RE GONNA BE
ONE HAPPY FAMILY.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.470
PRENTISS: GO AHEAD,
GARCIA.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.037
GARCIA: OK. I HAVE PINGED
JORDAN HALLORAN

32:32.080 --> 32:33.690
AND BECKY HUGHES' PHONE,
AND THEY ARE ON TOP
OF EACH OTHER.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.214
THEY ARE BOTH
AT HER HOUSE.

32:35.257 --> 32:36.911
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THEIR PRIOR
COMMUNICATION?

32:36.955 --> 32:38.347
DID THEY STAY
IN TOUCH?

32:38.391 --> 32:39.783
GARCIA: NO, NO.
SHE CUT OFF COMMUNICATION

32:39.827 --> 32:41.307
8 YEARS AGO FOLLOWING
THE VOLUNTARY SURRENDER.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.613
THERE'S BEEN NO CELL,
NO SOCIAL MEDIA CONTACT, NONE.

32:43.657 --> 32:46.007
ROSSI: HE'S IN FULL
FLIGHT FROM REALITY,
BUT SHE'S NOT.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.357
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
GOOD IF SHE DOESN'T
