00:17.888 --> 00:19.607
I'm loving the bathroom showroom.

00:19.608 --> 00:22.167
Got these new soft-close
toilet seats in.

00:22.168 --> 00:24.527
It's like they're winking at you
in slow motion.

00:24.528 --> 00:25.808
Flirty little fuckers.

00:25.809 --> 00:28.007
'Hans has sold out.
A job and a suit

00:28.008 --> 00:30.087
'and now we're burning
all our band stuff.

'Even the contract we signed
with God on mephedrone.'

00:32.888 --> 00:35.168
Are we really going to do this?
Yeah. This is it, man.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.647
This is the day the music died.

00:37.648 --> 00:39.087
This is the end of...

00:39.088 --> 00:40.607
What were we called?

00:40.608 --> 00:43.088
Dunno. 13 Bastards?

00:44.148 --> 00:46.288
Hello, boys. Excuse me.

00:46.718 --> 00:47.717
More, Mark?

00:47.718 --> 00:49.877
It's a table for my printer.

00:49.878 --> 00:53.317
You're not doing a barbecue again,
are you? You know that doesn't work.

00:53.318 --> 00:55.798
Could you please stop
trying to kill me with flat packs?

00:55.799 --> 00:57.877
I'm on my way. I'm going. I've gone.

00:57.878 --> 00:59.258
Clearly you haven't gone.
Basically I have.

00:59.305 --> 01:00.503
You've stopped paying rent.

01:00.504 --> 01:02.665
Or you've stopped being guilty
about not paying rent.

01:02.666 --> 01:06.424
There's always my place, Jez.
I've got the bag. The bag's yours.

01:06.425 --> 01:08.944
Cheers, man.
'Not the bag, never Hans's bag.'

01:08.945 --> 01:10.704
And Mark, just so you know,

01:10.705 --> 01:13.584
the guys at the showroom
are looking for more hands on deck.

01:13.585 --> 01:15.664
Money's tasty.
And you get to work with toilets,

01:15.665 --> 01:18.704
which is obviously funny.
And showers, which are sexy.

01:18.705 --> 01:21.064
OK, a job.
Yeah. I'll put a word in.

01:21.065 --> 01:23.024
Thanks for the job tip, Hans.

01:23.025 --> 01:25.144
'Christ.
Headhunted by Super Hans.

01:25.145 --> 01:27.063
'He might be one of the few
Western headhunters

01:27.064 --> 01:28.863
'who would physically
chop a head off.'

01:28.864 --> 01:30.225
'Why didn't I get the job tip?

01:30.226 --> 01:32.865
'We could have been
the Chemical Toilet Brothers.'

01:34.305 --> 01:38.304
'So great that Dobby's agreed to
move in. Just got to close the deal.

01:38.305 --> 01:40.785
'Get her into the flat and keep her
locked down like Fritzl.

01:40.786 --> 01:44.424
'No, not like Fritzl!
Like a nice, normal, loving guy

01:44.425 --> 01:47.504
'who knows where she is
at all times. Which at no point

01:47.505 --> 01:48.865
'would be locked in the cellar.'

01:48.866 --> 01:50.504
Good time at Gerard's last night?

01:50.505 --> 01:52.144
Yeah. We had a game of Connect 4.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.344
Oh. Connect 4.

01:53.345 --> 01:56.704
'God, he's so sickly.
She never plays Connect 4 with me.

01:56.705 --> 01:59.584
'I'd love to play Connect 4
with her...if it wasn't so boring.'

01:59.585 --> 02:02.584
He's not in a great way.
Poor guy can barely move.

02:02.585 --> 02:04.144
Oh, really?

02:04.145 --> 02:06.864
'I bet some parts of him
can move very well.'

02:06.865 --> 02:09.624
Looks like I've got a job interview
lined up. Bathroom supplies.

02:09.625 --> 02:12.704
Incredibly flat management
structure, which is cool.

02:12.705 --> 02:15.424
Amazing.
'Ah, lovely fake enthusiasm.'

02:15.425 --> 02:19.224
Hey, Mark, can you
open a tin of mushy peas?

02:19.225 --> 02:21.344
'Hold on, what's that?
What's that there?'

02:21.345 --> 02:22.705
Oh, new tin-opener. Sweet.

02:22.706 --> 02:26.064
'I've got a tin-opener.
Why's she buying a new tin-opener?

02:26.065 --> 02:27.784
'Fuck! She's not gonna move in.

02:27.785 --> 02:31.304
'This is no pound-shop tin-opener,
this is a luxury tin-opener.

02:31.305 --> 02:34.344
'She's gonna use this to open her
single tins, and then somehow get

02:34.345 --> 02:37.224
'the sexual satisfaction from it
I so obviously can't give her!'

02:37.225 --> 02:39.944
Oh, er, Dobs,
just cos I need to do a form,

02:39.945 --> 02:41.785
when do you think
you might be moving in?

02:41.786 --> 02:46.224
Er, yeah, soon.
The rent here's killing me, so, yeah.

02:46.225 --> 02:49.504
When I can get the bloody deposit
sorted and get my shit together.

02:49.505 --> 02:52.504
Ah, cool.
'The getting together of the shit.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.905
'Could take a night.
Could take five years.'

02:56.585 --> 02:57.945
Shit. Nuke this, will you?

02:57.946 --> 03:01.864
'Need more information.
The tin-opener isn't conclusive.

03:01.865 --> 03:03.423
'Could ask her straight
how she feels...'

03:03.424 --> 03:04.505
Oh, hi, Gerard.

03:04.506 --> 03:06.064
'Yeah, right!

03:06.065 --> 03:08.224
'What if I broke the microwave?

03:08.225 --> 03:11.944
'Test case. If she buys a new one,
I'll know she's never moving in.

03:11.945 --> 03:13.784
'Hmm. Can I?

03:13.785 --> 03:17.504
'Yeah. Maybe a good old waggle
in there. Take that, mechanism.

03:17.505 --> 03:19.783
'You weren't built for the
screwdriver, were you?

03:19.784 --> 03:21.585
'You don't like that in there,
do you?

03:22.705 --> 03:24.704
- 'No macaroni for us tonight.'
- Bye.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.304
'Sorry, microwave.'

03:26.305 --> 03:29.224
Oh, Dobs, looks like your bloody
microwave's bust or something.

03:29.225 --> 03:31.225
Still, I've got one at mine, so...

03:33.065 --> 03:36.944
Oh! But I only do robot cooking.
I can't do analogue.

03:36.945 --> 03:39.224
Screw it.
I'll grab something at Gerard's.

03:39.225 --> 03:41.504
Gerard's?
That was him just now.

03:41.505 --> 03:45.064
He's feeling a lot worse. I said
I'd go over for a bit. Is that cool?

03:45.065 --> 03:46.224
Oh, sure.

03:46.225 --> 03:50.864
'The sickly Casanova. Aiming for
a bit more Connect 4-play.

03:50.865 --> 03:53.984
'Well, I'm going to block
your bright red cock

03:53.985 --> 03:57.545
'with my multiple...discs of...
yellow...cock.'

03:58.985 --> 04:00.904
Hi, Dobs,
thanks for coming over.

04:00.905 --> 04:03.144
'Yes, Gerard,
but there's a sting in the tail,

04:03.145 --> 04:07.704
'a scorpion in the Kinder egg, a
nail in the Toblerone, and 'tis I.'

04:07.705 --> 04:09.984
Oh! Hi, Mark.

04:09.985 --> 04:12.944
Yes. We were about to have
a romantic Italian dinner for two

04:12.945 --> 04:15.864
when you rang,
so I thought I'd come along.

04:15.865 --> 04:17.704
Oh, great. Great, yeah, great.

04:17.704 --> 04:19.904
How are you doing,
you big fuck-stick?

04:19.904 --> 04:21.184
I feel awful.

04:21.185 --> 04:24.144
Oh, that's not the spirit.
Mind over matter.

04:24.145 --> 04:26.704
Your friend the Cyberman
wouldn't be so defeatist,

04:26.705 --> 04:29.504
nor would any
of your other brilliant... dolls.

04:29.505 --> 04:30.625
I'll get you a pie on.

04:30.626 --> 04:33.704
Which do you want, grey matter pie
or brown matter pie?

04:33.705 --> 04:35.985
Grey matter would be lovely,
thank you.

04:40.785 --> 04:43.584
I know what you're doing,
Gerard.

04:43.585 --> 04:46.144
What's that, Mark? Being quite ill?

04:46.145 --> 04:48.264
I've got my beady eye on you.

04:48.265 --> 04:49.864
You're barking up the wrong tree.

04:49.865 --> 04:53.784
She's not interested
in romancing the stone, Gerard.

04:53.785 --> 04:56.584
It's no dice for you
and your sickly ways.

04:56.585 --> 05:00.344
Yeah? We'll see about that.

05:00.345 --> 05:02.185
I'm playing the long game.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.225
Where's your inhaler, G-man?

05:07.226 --> 05:10.864
Maybe in the spare room?
Ken took the last of his stuff.

05:10.865 --> 05:13.144
It feels funny to be all alone.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.584
To be honest,
if I could just find a pal,

05:15.585 --> 05:17.785
I'd ask them to move in rent-free.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.704
Don't worry, Mark.
I'll take good care of her.

05:22.705 --> 05:25.424
Very, very good care indeed.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.545
'I can't compete with that!
A free room at Gerard's

05:27.546 --> 05:30.345
'versus 50 quid a week
for Fritzl's cellar!'

05:31.785 --> 05:35.264
'Time to say goodbye to Daddy
and hand you over to Mummy.

05:35.265 --> 05:37.824
'Mmm. Pretty sure
he's parked a turd in there.

05:37.825 --> 05:40.064
'Sophie can change that in the lift.'

05:40.065 --> 05:41.224
Hi, Soph.

05:41.225 --> 05:42.584
'Oh, great.'

05:42.585 --> 05:44.264
All right, Mark? Jeff?

05:44.265 --> 05:45.944
I'm here for Ian.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.864
Didn't Soph tell you? We're back on.

05:48.865 --> 05:51.145
I moved into Nana's cottage
last month, so...

05:52.305 --> 05:53.424
Oh, right.

05:53.425 --> 05:55.144
'God. Should I...

05:55.145 --> 05:57.824
'give the thing I love best
to the man I hate most?'

05:57.825 --> 05:58.824
Say bye-bye.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.824
Bye-bye. See you later, Mark.
Bye-bye.

06:01.825 --> 06:03.864
Has he...?

06:03.865 --> 06:05.145
Don't think so, mate.

06:05.146 --> 06:07.824
'Maybe Ian won't remember
I gave him away to another man.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.065
'If he does, he'll be
some kind of memory genius.

06:10.066 --> 06:12.664
' "Yeah, my son hates me, but he
can remember a full deck of cards

06:12.665 --> 06:14.425
' "and that's why
he lives in Vegas." '

06:14.426 --> 06:18.064
Jeff?
I think it's OK.

06:18.065 --> 06:19.984
Or do you think there's any chance

06:19.985 --> 06:22.144
he's trying to kill
all my offspring?

06:22.145 --> 06:23.945
Like Herod?

06:26.425 --> 06:29.384
That's a lot of shopping, Jez.
Yeah, stocking up.

06:29.385 --> 06:32.064
Right. It's just Dobby
might well have moved in

06:32.065 --> 06:34.064
before we eat all these
horrible lentils.

06:34.065 --> 06:35.225
I've just got the feeling,

06:35.226 --> 06:37.544
maybe, I'm going to get to finish
these lentils.

06:37.545 --> 06:40.305
She is moving in, you know.
I'm getting a firm date.

06:41.545 --> 06:43.184
Why have you got cat food?

06:43.185 --> 06:45.744
To confuse them.
Fucking Nectar inspectors.

06:45.745 --> 06:48.624
That's why I got the denture
cleaner, to throw them a weird one.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.825
"Who are these guys?"

06:49.826 --> 06:52.784
Great, so now they'll think we're
a couple of guys with our booze

06:52.785 --> 06:57.064
and our pizzas and a cat we starve
and an old man we've kidnapped,

06:57.065 --> 06:59.504
whose dentures
we periodically deign to cleanse.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.224
Mm-hmm.

07:01.225 --> 07:02.344
Hey.

07:02.345 --> 07:03.984
Margherita or pepperoni, Dobs?

07:03.985 --> 07:06.704
Ooh, it's like Sophie's Choice.

07:06.705 --> 07:09.984
If Meryl Streep had given birth
to a pair of Chicago Town pizzas.

07:09.985 --> 07:14.424
Oh, Jez, Mark told me about
you burning the band. Are you OK?

07:14.425 --> 07:15.905
Yeah, I'm too big to fail.

07:15.906 --> 07:17.864
He doesn't know what that means.

07:17.865 --> 07:19.063
I do know what that means.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.505
'He doesn't know what that means.'

07:20.506 --> 07:23.784
Anyway, it's cool. I've always got
the 3-0 Walcott millions.

07:23.785 --> 07:27.184
Jeremy's planning to sell the
headline "3-0 Walcott"

07:27.185 --> 07:30.624
to a tabloid newspaper
when Theo Walcott turns 30

07:30.625 --> 07:33.304
and we've agreed not to argue
whether that's a good plan.

07:33.305 --> 07:35.264
It is a good plan.
I know.

07:35.265 --> 07:38.904
Listen, my mate Alice
is seeing a shit-hot therapist.

07:38.905 --> 07:41.904
He's sorted her right out.
Work, relationships,

07:41.905 --> 07:45.624
her OCD about visiting every mainland
Holland & Barrett, everything.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.464
I'd love to do therapy.

07:47.465 --> 07:50.504
Get someone's hands in my brain,
have a root around.

07:50.505 --> 07:51.904
I just can't afford it.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.424
You know what, Jez, if you like,
I could pay for you to have therapy.

07:55.425 --> 07:57.544
It's not with electric, is it?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.304
No. He's really amazing.

07:59.305 --> 08:01.304
And it's only 500
for an intensive course.

08:01.305 --> 08:05.704
Why don't I give you that? Your
deposit, since you're moving on.

08:05.705 --> 08:08.624
Really? Are you sure?
What about the stain?

08:08.625 --> 08:11.144
It's a goodbye gift. Fuck the stain.

08:11.145 --> 08:14.464
Dude! I thought you were going to
wheedle me for ages about the stain.

08:14.465 --> 08:17.184
Spend it on a nut doctor
to work out what's wrong with you.

08:17.185 --> 08:18.305
I love you, Mark.

08:18.306 --> 08:20.225
I like you too, Jez.

08:21.425 --> 08:22.424
It's Gerard.

08:22.425 --> 08:24.784
Oh, Dobs, you saw him last night

08:24.785 --> 08:26.784
and the night before.

08:26.785 --> 08:29.704
It's like you're turning into
his personal bum-boy.

08:29.705 --> 08:31.144
He's really ill, Mark.

08:31.145 --> 08:34.063
I was really looking forward to
spending the evening with you.

08:34.065 --> 08:37.424
I could be there and back in under
an hour. He might have got worse.

08:37.424 --> 08:40.304
But... it looks like there's someone
on The Apprentice

08:40.304 --> 08:43.943
who I think we're both going
to really loathe. A real specimen.

08:43.945 --> 08:46.064
I've seen it. He is a shit-bag.

08:46.065 --> 08:49.304
Look, Dobs, sometimes
you need to draw a line.

08:49.305 --> 08:51.744
Whoa! You manhandled my phone.

08:51.745 --> 08:54.384
That's pretty Fifty Shades
of fucking Grey.

08:54.385 --> 08:55.865
You know you wanted me to.

08:55.866 --> 08:59.265
Right, well, this bloke
better be a solid gold twat.

09:01.825 --> 09:06.064
'Right, therapy.
What do I really want from therapy?

09:06.065 --> 09:08.944
'A harsh, unremitting stare
at the bare facts of my actual life.

09:08.945 --> 09:13.024
'Oh, fuck that, he's eating a Twix!
I can't take him seriously.'

09:13.025 --> 09:13.705
Mr Usbourne?

09:13.706 --> 09:16.785
Sorry, I'm Mr Smith, wrong house,
I'm not coming back. Goodbye.

09:19.145 --> 09:21.623
Grayson's the kind of guy
who'll respect you more

09:21.624 --> 09:22.745
if you stand up to him.

09:22.746 --> 09:25.304
'Interview advice from the
disordered mind of the crackhead.'

09:25.305 --> 09:26.184
Right.

09:26.185 --> 09:27.665
You should be like, "No, mate.

09:27.666 --> 09:30.584
"Let me stop you there. This
interview's gone on long enough.

09:30.585 --> 09:33.025
"I need a shit and a glass of water.
I'll be back in five."

09:33.026 --> 09:35.944
Then march out, stroll round the
block, back in, he'll love all that.

09:35.945 --> 09:37.944
A shit and a glass of water?

09:37.945 --> 09:41.184
Yeah, whatever. "I've got
a headache, need a baguette."

09:41.185 --> 09:43.704
'OK, here goes.
At least I'm the first one in.

09:43.705 --> 09:45.904
'Hi, Robert Grayson.
I'm Mark Corrigan.

09:45.905 --> 09:47.745
'Hi, Robert Grayson.
Pleased to meet you.

09:47.746 --> 09:50.504
'Hi, Mr Grayson.
Pleased to meet you.

09:50.505 --> 09:52.904
Mr Grayson's ready for you.
Thank you.

09:52.905 --> 09:55.024
'Hi, Mr Grayson.
Pleased to meet you.'

09:55.025 --> 09:56.945
Hi, I'm Robert Grayson.
Pleased to meet you.

09:56.946 --> 09:58.384
No, I'm Robert Grayson.

09:58.385 --> 10:00.224
No, s-sure.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.704
Are you Robert Grayson?

10:01.705 --> 10:03.304
No, I'm sorry. You are.

10:03.305 --> 10:06.024
You are, I'm not. I'm very sorry.

10:06.025 --> 10:08.504
'Mmm. I have a sudden
overpowering desire

10:08.505 --> 10:10.625
'for a glass of water
and a baguette.

10:11.665 --> 10:13.664
'Wow. I can't believe
I got a second interview!

10:13.665 --> 10:16.184
'If I can only remember
my own name at the next one,

10:16.185 --> 10:18.584
'I might be in with a chance.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.824
'Hang on,
this is prime therapy time.

10:20.825 --> 10:24.664
'Oh, I get it. The lady doth
eat bhaji too much, methinks.

10:24.665 --> 10:28.064
'I've seen behind the curtain.
Ahoy there, moral high ground.

10:28.065 --> 10:30.584
'He's wasting 500 of my pounds!

10:30.585 --> 10:32.785
'And it feels fantastic.'

10:35.225 --> 10:37.584
Hi, Jez. How was your session?

10:37.585 --> 10:40.944
Oh, good, yeah. Amazing.
Reckon I'll be cured soon.

10:40.945 --> 10:42.904
"Cured?" Did they use that phrase?

10:42.905 --> 10:44.744
I don't really want to go into it,

10:44.745 --> 10:46.864
but we hit upon a lot of
key issues...

10:46.865 --> 10:47.943
'Me and Dr Bhaji.'

10:47.944 --> 10:49.825
Well, they certainly cost
a pretty penny,

10:49.826 --> 10:51.944
so they must know
what they're talking about.

10:51.945 --> 10:54.864
I guess you won't have had
the chance to get anything to eat.

10:54.865 --> 10:57.384
Oh, er, no, that's right.

10:57.385 --> 10:58.784
I thought so.

10:58.785 --> 11:01.905
So I've got us both
a lovely big curry as a treat.

11:02.785 --> 11:03.864
Oh! Good.

11:03.865 --> 11:05.944
Come on, sit down.

11:05.945 --> 11:08.224
Tuck in. There's bhajis.

11:08.225 --> 11:11.064
'Is he fucking me?
How would he know?

11:11.065 --> 11:13.305
'Unless he drives around
in a Jeremy detector van.'

11:13.306 --> 11:16.905
Chicken tikka masala,
balti tiger prawn...

11:17.945 --> 11:19.504
vegetable korma.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.944
I thought
I'd really push the boat out.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.864
There's a naan and a half each.

11:23.865 --> 11:25.025
Lovely.

11:28.745 --> 11:32.384
So, are they any particular school,
your therapists, Jez?

11:32.385 --> 11:34.224
I'm interested.

11:34.225 --> 11:35.545
Oh, you know, a...

11:37.225 --> 11:38.145
mixture.

11:38.146 --> 11:40.664
A mixture? That is interesting.

11:40.665 --> 11:46.144
Have some of the lamb pasanda.
It's incredibly rich and creamy.

11:46.145 --> 11:48.744
You're such a bastard.

11:48.745 --> 11:51.744
I've bought you a lovely curry.
What's wrong with that?

11:51.745 --> 11:54.065
You know, don't you? You know
exactly what's wrong with it.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.664
No.

11:55.665 --> 11:57.504
Just tell me.

11:57.505 --> 12:00.224
Just say it, and it'll all be fine.

12:00.225 --> 12:03.144
No more curry, no more problem.

12:03.145 --> 12:05.025
I'm not saying it.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.265
Then eat up.

12:09.225 --> 12:11.143
All right, I didn't go to the
therapist.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.505
I had onion bhajis instead.

12:12.506 --> 12:14.864
You're the king,
I'm a piece of shit.

12:14.865 --> 12:18.224
I pissed it up the wall, like I piss
everything up the wall. Happy now?

12:18.225 --> 12:20.504
Yes, I am happy now.

12:20.505 --> 12:23.945
I'm a shithead. I need help.
I need therapy.

12:26.785 --> 12:29.784
Hey, great news! I got called back
for a second interview

12:29.785 --> 12:31.504
at Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings.

12:31.505 --> 12:33.384
Congratulations.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.705
Gerard's dead.

12:36.145 --> 12:37.424
What?

12:37.425 --> 12:40.224
- He's dead. He died.
- When?

12:40.225 --> 12:43.224
Last night,
a couple of hours after he called.

12:43.225 --> 12:45.224
Oh, Jesus!

12:45.225 --> 12:47.864
'Fucking hell, Gerard,
there was no need to die.

12:47.865 --> 12:50.944
'God, I only disliked you a bit,
I didn't want you to...

12:50.945 --> 12:53.744
'Fuck. Oh, bloody hell.'

12:53.745 --> 12:55.145
Things took a turn for the worse.

12:55.146 --> 12:57.304
He got taken to hospital,
but it was too late.

12:57.305 --> 13:00.944
Blimey. What did he die of?

13:00.945 --> 13:01.705
Flu.

13:01.706 --> 13:04.024
He died of flu?

13:04.025 --> 13:08.304
Hey, Jeremy, Gerard's died of flu!

13:08.305 --> 13:09.584
Bullshit.

13:09.585 --> 13:10.665
Seriously.

13:14.025 --> 13:15.185
Bloody hell.

13:17.305 --> 13:18.864
That is so Gerard.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.144
I know!

13:20.145 --> 13:22.224
He had a weak immune system, Mark.

13:22.225 --> 13:25.305
Mmm. He had a weak everything,
to be fair, Dobs.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.704
'Oh, my goodness. Dead.

13:28.705 --> 13:32.704
'He's actually dead, he's gone.
He's never coming back.'

13:32.705 --> 13:34.784
He left a message.
D'you want to hear it?

13:34.785 --> 13:37.025
Oh, God, er...

13:37.585 --> 13:39.704
'Hi, Dobs. Not feeling great.

13:39.705 --> 13:41.144
'Don't trouble yourself.

13:41.145 --> 13:45.185
'Er, I just wanted to say hi but,
er, I guess I'll just say bye.'

13:46.345 --> 13:49.224
I can't believe you cancelled his
call so we could have a frozen pizza

13:49.225 --> 13:51.584
and watch The Apprentice.

13:51.585 --> 13:54.704
In a way, though, don't you think
that's what he would have wanted?

13:54.705 --> 13:56.584
No.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.864
I just wish I could have said goodbye
to him.

13:58.865 --> 14:01.064
Sure. Me too.

14:01.065 --> 14:04.305
I wish he was OK, I really do.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.304
'Hi, Dobs.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.944
'Not feeling great.
Don't trouble yourself.

14:08.945 --> 14:13.144
'Er, I just wanted to say hi
but, er, I guess I'll just say bye.'

14:13.145 --> 14:16.424
'The reproachful,
but still quite irritating voice

14:16.425 --> 14:17.864
'from beyond the grave.'

14:17.865 --> 14:21.864
His sister wants me to help organise
the funeral. Her head's in pieces.

14:21.865 --> 14:23.745
Their mum and dad are both gone,
so...

14:25.145 --> 14:26.784
Do you know what, Dobs?

14:26.785 --> 14:30.504
We're going to make this
the best darn funeral ever.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.584
Nice chapel, eulogies,

14:32.585 --> 14:35.624
the wake somewhere lovely.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.064
I can get a wake cake.

14:37.065 --> 14:39.224
'Ooh,
he's gone over the edge there.'

14:39.225 --> 14:42.304
'Jesus, life...spinning past.

14:42.305 --> 14:45.864
'Every second.
Every single fleeting moment.

14:45.865 --> 14:47.704
'Till we're gone.

14:47.705 --> 14:49.505
'I'm taking a look
at my phone tariff.

14:49.506 --> 14:52.585
'I've got a very strong feeling
I'm being fucked in the arse.'

14:52.745 --> 14:54.185
'Third place we've been to.

14:54.998 --> 14:58.117
'Feels like she's still
seeing more of him than me.

14:58.118 --> 15:00.997
'Funeral parlour. Massage parlour.

15:00.998 --> 15:04.357
'Those are the main parlours,
aren't they? What's the link?

15:04.358 --> 15:07.358
'Both lying down?
Except, pizza parlour?'

15:07.361 --> 15:10.041
Hey, guys. This one... feel right?

15:10.100 --> 15:12.899
I think so, yeah. Don't you, Dobby?

15:12.900 --> 15:14.060
I think it does.

15:14.061 --> 15:16.179
Oh, great, that is nice.

15:16.180 --> 15:19.179
It looks, if this doesn't sound
weird,

15:19.180 --> 15:20.819
like his sort of place.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.419
'Mm, definitely does sound weird.'

15:22.420 --> 15:23.819
Do you know what I mean?

15:23.820 --> 15:25.619
I do know what you mean, yeah.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.380
Dry, understated, but warm.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.259
Gerard.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.300
Yeah...

15:32.380 --> 15:33.419
Gerard.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.219
'The guy's really come into his own
since he's been dead.'

15:36.220 --> 15:38.620
Yeah, and they can get the chapel
Katy wanted at the time she wanted.

15:38.621 --> 15:39.659
Friday at 11.

15:39.660 --> 15:42.899
But is that the best time?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.379
Is that a good time?

15:44.380 --> 15:45.500
It's a very popular time.

15:45.501 --> 15:47.419
It's just, it's stupid really,

15:47.420 --> 15:50.539
but I have actually got called back
for a second interview,

15:50.540 --> 15:53.059
and I wondered,
because that's set,

15:53.060 --> 15:55.259
whether maybe we should consider...

15:55.260 --> 15:55.740
Mark!

15:55.741 --> 15:57.659
Forget I said anything.

15:57.660 --> 16:00.139
Forget the interview.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.539
But never, repeat never...

16:02.540 --> 16:04.220
forget Gerard.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.179
'Interview, then funeral.
The ultimate combo.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.180
'Minicab waiting,

16:11.181 --> 16:12.979
'same outfit for both.'
Ah, Mark,

16:12.980 --> 16:14.259
come on in.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.899
OK, so, for the second stage,

16:15.900 --> 16:17.698
we thought we'd take
a different approach.

16:17.699 --> 16:18.740
A joint interview.

16:18.741 --> 16:21.459
Test your group decision making
and personnel skills.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.899
Good?

16:22.900 --> 16:25.459
Great. Survival of the slickest.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.979
Hmm. Exactly.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.779
So, you should all have had time

16:28.780 --> 16:30.698
to look at the task.
Yeah, it's a great task.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.660
But I think we should
really try and...

16:32.661 --> 16:34.379
think outside the box on this one.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.939
'Just leave that to hang
like the bad fart it is.'

16:37.940 --> 16:41.219
If I may, perhaps we should
pool our skill sets

16:41.220 --> 16:42.980
by subdividing into working groups.

16:42.981 --> 16:46.899
How about you guys
look at the logo and web strategy,

16:46.900 --> 16:49.459
while Hugh has a think
about the rebrand?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.019
OK.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.939
'Fucking my rival with the dildo
of the impossible rebrand.'

16:53.940 --> 16:57.619
And, if you like, I can link us
all together and do the boring stuff.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.660
'He said, self-effacingly,
as he definitely secured the job.'

17:03.140 --> 17:06.579
'Mmm, he looks OK.
Wonder what's wrong with him.

17:06.579 --> 17:07.858
'Mistook his wife for a hat?

17:07.858 --> 17:09.578
'Mistook his hat for
a child called It?'

17:09.579 --> 17:11.460
Mr Bendicks will be with you
in five minutes.

17:11.461 --> 17:14.739
'"Mr Bendicks?" Is that a joke?
Maybe it's a test.

17:14.740 --> 17:17.099
'If you tell him his name makes you
think of bendy dicks,

17:17.101 --> 17:19.739
'he knows that you need
the electric?

17:19.740 --> 17:21.578
Relax, just take it quick and easy.

17:21.579 --> 17:23.980
'Whip through a couple of my issues,
drugs, career, women,

17:23.981 --> 17:26.499
'the way I can't go to sleep
unless I'm wearing a woolly hat.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.539
'And he'll be like,
"Dude, you're cool.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.539
"Everyone does
the woolly hat thing."

17:31.540 --> 17:33.939
"We are the Lord's..."
Hey, hey, hey.

17:33.940 --> 17:35.380
This place is great! What a find.

17:35.381 --> 17:37.499
You're very fucking chipper, Mark.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.339
Sorry, it's just, it went pretty
well at the interview.

17:40.340 --> 17:42.219
At the funeral, not so much.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.179
No, sure. Obviously.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.460
"For it is written..."

17:45.461 --> 17:47.859
Still, this looks like a great
funeral.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.219
'God, I feel so upbeat!'

17:49.220 --> 17:51.139
Yeah, well, he was a nice guy.

17:51.140 --> 17:54.499
'This is a megafuneral.
It was a mega interview.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.259
'Hugh was the only real rival.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.739
'But look what's happened to Gerard.
This is what I do to rivals.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.819
'I put my rivals in the ground.'

18:01.820 --> 18:04.259
Alan Johnson.

18:04.260 --> 18:05.419
Hi, guys.

18:05.420 --> 18:10.059
My first memory of this great little
guy in the... big old box here

18:10.060 --> 18:13.380
was when Gerard's cheeky little face
poked round my door at JLB.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.419
He was sniffing around
for a raise that,

18:17.420 --> 18:19.900
given what I don't think anyone
will mind me saying,

18:19.901 --> 18:23.260
were his very limited attributes,
was bloody outrageous.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.659
Look. Nothing can make
today all right.

18:27.660 --> 18:31.219
But maybe we can take some comfort
from the brutal reality

18:31.220 --> 18:33.540
that the weak must
make way for the strong.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.620
Evolution marches on.
The scythe is remorseless.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.339
I hope the scythe's
remorseless swing

18:42.340 --> 18:44.460
can bring some comfort to you all.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.499
- OK.
- Thank you very much, Alan,

18:48.500 --> 18:50.859
for those inspiring
yet challenging words.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.779
'A third interview, in half an hour?

18:53.780 --> 18:56.379
'Say no? Hugh won't say no.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.939
'Could I? Out in five,
cab over in 20?'

18:58.940 --> 19:01.219
Now Gerard's close friend,
Mark Corrigan.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.299
'Yeah. Listerine in the cab,
swill the backwash into my Volvic,

19:04.300 --> 19:06.699
'spurt of Lynx.
It's the busy man's shower.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.539
'OK, the edit. The brutal edit.'

19:09.540 --> 19:11.419
Er, OK. Hi.

19:11.420 --> 19:16.139
So, there's... there's so much
to say about Gerard.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.540
That can all go. That goes.

19:17.541 --> 19:20.739
In a way, whatever I say
will end up feeling incomplete.

19:20.740 --> 19:23.779
Covered myself there.
So, why don't I just sum up?

19:23.780 --> 19:26.419
My first day, I thought,
"What a great guy."

19:26.420 --> 19:28.379
I liked him as soon as I met him.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.219
This is going to take forever.

19:30.220 --> 19:34.779
Yes, I mean, why don't I just
give you the stories, the highlights?

19:34.780 --> 19:38.979
Aberdeen, the Finnemore numbers,
tube up the nose!

19:38.980 --> 19:41.099
But so... noble.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.019
World Of Warcraft, huge for him,

19:44.020 --> 19:47.059
JLB, obviously,
which I think Alan hit.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.140
Sum up, time to sum up.

19:48.141 --> 19:51.019
Look, I don't want to warble on
when we probably all want to be out,

19:51.020 --> 19:53.260
grieving and crying in a more
well-catered environment.

19:53.261 --> 19:55.499
Sarnies, God, he loved a sandwich.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.339
Seriously. 'That's enough.'
So, I just feel very sad.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.219
That's the take-home message
which I want you all to go away with.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.739
'Think I got away with that. Yeah.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.460
'If you've got any complaints,
tell 'em to Gerard.'

20:06.940 --> 20:09.659
'OK, Mr Bendicks, bring it on.'

20:09.660 --> 20:10.979
Want some Curly Wurly?

20:10.980 --> 20:13.459
'Yeah, you weren't expecting that,
were you?'

20:13.460 --> 20:15.339
Nothing, OK.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.020
I've heard about this.
Harsh Freudian.

20:18.340 --> 20:20.780
I suppose you want me to sit here,
yeah?

20:21.860 --> 20:25.619
Well, how about
if I go and stand over here instead?

20:25.620 --> 20:27.540
Do you think you can handle that?
Mm?

20:29.740 --> 20:32.499
So I suppose I can say anything in
here. That's the whole idea, right?

20:32.500 --> 20:36.019
I can call you a dickhead if I want.
Yeah, got a big dick for your head.

20:36.020 --> 20:38.099
'Is he going to get me sectioned?

20:38.100 --> 20:40.500
'I hope he doesn't have a secret
sectioning button under there.'

20:40.501 --> 20:45.099
So what do you want me to do?
Pull down my pants and fertilise
the plants? Oh, you'd love that.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.779
Yeah. Then you'd have a real
"patient" on your hands.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.339
More "mental millions"
for your high-interest account

20:51.340 --> 20:52.859
or ISA or share portfolio

20:52.860 --> 20:55.379
or to spend on your wife
or your boyfriend,

20:55.380 --> 20:59.139
chowing down on an Aberdeen Angus
steak from your Volkswagen Passat.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.099
That's right, kimosabe,
I've got your number.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.178
Yeah. Doesn't feel very nice
when the searchlight

21:04.179 --> 21:06.140
is turned on
the searchlight operator.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.100
Hmm? Yeah, pal?

21:09.980 --> 21:13.699
How about if I just pulled my knob
out and started wanking? Yeah?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.020
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

21:15.021 --> 21:18.539
My gonads out, one ball dangling
in front of each eye.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.299
That's your dream, yeah?

21:20.300 --> 21:21.940
Well, I'm not going to!

21:22.980 --> 21:24.899
Would you like a glass of water?

21:24.900 --> 21:26.340
Yes, please.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.300
Where the hell have you been, Mark?

21:29.301 --> 21:32.899
Me? Oh, nightmare.
Getting hold of the wake cake.

21:32.900 --> 21:33.580
Wake cake?

21:33.581 --> 21:34.940
Gotta have a wake cake.

21:36.780 --> 21:40.019
Ta-dah! Specially made.

21:40.020 --> 21:43.219
I don't think so.
This is a football cake.

21:43.220 --> 21:46.379
No! Gerard loved the... the Reds,

21:46.380 --> 21:48.859
the... red team.

21:48.860 --> 21:51.260
You've made something up
and then scrimped on it.

21:51.261 --> 21:54.259
'Oh, come on! There were three
shelves of cakes cheaper than this.'

21:54.260 --> 21:55.979
Hey, Mark, how was the funeral?

21:55.980 --> 21:57.180
Great, I got the job!

21:57.181 --> 22:01.299
That's amazing! That's amazing news.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.899
Are you... OK?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.859
Mark, I love therapy.

22:04.860 --> 22:05.660
OK, good.

22:05.661 --> 22:07.779
You should have therapy.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.459
He should have therapy.
Everybody should have therapy.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.780
OK, good. What did he say?

22:11.781 --> 22:13.339
Therapy, therapy, therapy.

22:13.340 --> 22:16.259
Yeah, is it just saying "therapy"
that you're into now?

22:16.260 --> 22:18.259
Mark, today is the day I worked out

22:18.260 --> 22:21.419
I am not currently
a very successful musician.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.659
I know, yes.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.340
Yeah, I know you know.
But now I know.

22:24.341 --> 22:27.059
And now I know
what I'm going to do with my life.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.218
'Sell it on eBay?'

22:28.219 --> 22:29.578
I'm going to become a therapist.

22:29.579 --> 22:30.460
'Of course.'

22:30.461 --> 22:31.859
I could therapise you.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.179
You really need therapy.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.939
Mark, can you give me a hand
microwaving these chicken bites?

22:35.940 --> 22:38.899
On my way. 'The microwave test.
The moment of truth.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.739
'Will she stay or will she go?
If she stays there will be trouble.

22:41.740 --> 22:44.059
'If she goes, I'll get a cuddle.'

22:44.060 --> 22:46.939
So what are you thinking
on the microwave, then, Dobs?

22:46.940 --> 22:48.738
Are you gonna just wait
and use mine when you...?

22:48.739 --> 22:50.020
Oh, I've fixed the microwave.

22:50.021 --> 22:51.900
You've... fixed it?

22:52.900 --> 22:56.659
It makes it think the door's closed,

22:56.660 --> 22:59.099
so it still goes,
even though it shouldn't!

22:59.100 --> 23:03.339
Great! You've tricked the microwave
into releasing its dangerous rays.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.659
It's fine.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.859
My ear is getting hot.
Is your ear hot?

23:07.860 --> 23:12.779
Dobby, are you going to move in
with me soon, do you reckon?

23:12.780 --> 23:18.259
Cos all this horrible death is making
me really keen to start my life.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.058
Well, you've been married
and had a baby.

23:20.059 --> 23:21.138
Yeah, but not really.

23:21.139 --> 23:22.778
I thought we were waiting
for Jez to move out.

23:22.779 --> 23:24.660
Yeah, but he won't move out
till you move in.

23:24.661 --> 23:27.899
And it's so expensive
for you here on your own.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.220
Actually, I'm cool about the money,

23:29.221 --> 23:33.179
because, you heard about this
little bit Gerard left me?

23:33.180 --> 23:35.579
Fucking good bloke, eh?

23:35.580 --> 23:38.099
I feel very free. You know?

23:38.100 --> 23:41.939
'She's never gonna move in.
Well played, Gerard.

23:41.940 --> 23:44.539
'You couldn't beat me on earth
so you're shitting on me from heaven.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.780
'Like a dead, jealous pigeon.'

23:48.482 --> 24:03.605
