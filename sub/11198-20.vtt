WEBVTT

00:11.840 --> 00:15.480
The Nikkei dropped 8%.
The yen continued its free fall.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.760
Also, the president of Togo
was deposed six hours ago.

00:18.840 --> 00:25.960
He got a plane to Nigeria. Now he's calling
for American troops to help restore order.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.880
- This is my first day.
- Yes, Mr President.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.840
<i>The New York Times is launching
an investigation into voting irregularities</i>

00:32.920 --> 00:36.200
in six southern states.
I've got Teddy on it.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.880
- Who are these people following me?
- They work for you, Mr President.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.960
Also, there's a storm in the Atlantic
about to hit Maine.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.840
They're expecting gale-force winds
and 20 inches of snow.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.640
- Shouldn't I know who they are?
- Yes, Mr President.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.720
Emergency management teams are
standing by, but we've scheduled a call

00:57.800 --> 01:01.040
so you can pledge your support.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.160
- They won't follow me all the time?
- No, Mr President.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.160
Good.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.000
Hello. Holly.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.560
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
is waiting for you in your office.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.520
- He knows it's my first day, right?
- Yes, Mr President.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.640
Good.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
- Francis.
- Mr President.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.640
We need to talk, sir. It's important.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.360
Guys.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.600
Let me enjoy the moment.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.280 --> 01:53.320
Moment's over, sir.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.840
Right.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.760
Stan, thank you. Thank you.

02:08.919 --> 02:12.720
Mr President, I'm here to bring you
up to speed on a programme

02:12.800 --> 02:16.560
we've been running out of Cheyenne
Mountain for the past seven years.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.200
I've already had my top-secret briefing.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.560
Yes, Mr President, but not this.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.280
For the past seven years, the Air Force
has been sending teams to other planets

02:29.360 --> 02:33.000
by means of an alien device
known as the Stargate.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.840
That's funny. That's very funny.
My first day.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.880
This is a joke, right?
I have a great sense of humour.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.960
I didn't know that you had one, but good,
we're finding out about each other.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.840
Now I have to call
the ex-president of Togo,

02:50.920 --> 02:56.000
and when I'm done, apparently,
the rest of the world is coming to an end.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.280
The ex-president of Togo
will have to wait, sir. This is not a joke.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.120
The United States Air Force has been
sending people to other planets?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.080
- Yes, sir.
- For seven years?

03:12.160 --> 03:15.560
- That's correct.
- By means of an alien device?

03:15.640 --> 03:17.480
Known as the Stargate.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.320
Senator McKnight is requesting
we move your meeting.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.640
Trying to duck me. He doesn't
want to commit on the crime bill.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.640
- What should I tell them?
- Forget it.

04:33.720 --> 04:39.640
The son of a bitch came in on our
coattails. Now it's time to pay the piper.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.600
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Mr President.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.560
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Sara.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.560
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

04:53.480 --> 04:58.160
You've just been briefed by the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs on our new reality.

04:58.240 --> 05:03.160
Not only do I find out that the Air Force
is engaged in interstellar travel,

05:03.240 --> 05:06.760
but I also find out
that my running mate knows all about it.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.960
- I was under a special gag order.
- Since when?

05:10.040 --> 05:12.400
- Six years now.
- That's unbelievable.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.160
Mr President,
I realise this is overwhelming,

05:15.240 --> 05:20.160
but what you need to know is that the
Stargate is being seriously mismanaged.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.680
- It's urgent that we act now.
- What are you talking about?

05:24.760 --> 05:29.680
I have desperately tried to maintain
some proper control and accountability,

05:29.760 --> 05:32.720
but the oversight in place
is completely inadequate.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.440
The military specifically.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.400
The personnel directly involved in the
SGC need to be replaced immediately.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.480
Now, I have several recommendations
regarding...

05:44.560 --> 05:47.240
Whoa, Bob, hold on here.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.680
Mr President, why do you think
I was ordered to keep quiet?

05:53.680 --> 05:57.680
This was an attempt by the military
and the previous administration

05:57.760 --> 06:03.400
to drive a wedge between us, because
they knew I was going to come after them.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.080
We need to stick together on this.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.200
For God's sakes, Bob,
think of the magnitude of this!

06:10.280 --> 06:12.720
"For God's sake" is right.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.080
Oh, come on, Bob. If you want me to buy
into your holier-than-thou position,

06:17.160 --> 06:20.440
you've got to convince me you're right.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.720
Hosted alien dignitaries.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.400
Acquired alien technology.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.440
Travelled back in time?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.280
Did they really blow up a sun?

06:39.920 --> 06:42.640
As I understand it, sir, yes, they did.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.440
It's gotta look awfully good
on the old resumÃ©, hey?

06:46.520 --> 06:51.880
- They've done pretty amazing things.
- You sound like a fan, Francis.

06:51.960 --> 06:56.840
Well, I can't help but appreciate the
number of times they've saved this world.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.680
Some people think
it wouldn't have needed saving

06:59.760 --> 07:02.600
had we left well enough alone.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.600
Well, you can't deny what's out there, sir.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.080
The enemy
would have come for us anyway.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.120
We need to be prepared.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.360
And no matter what anyone says,
the people at the SGC

07:13.440 --> 07:17.800
have done the best job anyone could
under the circumstances.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.600
- You don't trust the vice president?
- He obviously has his own agenda.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.560
I know he tried to shut them down
when he was at Appropriations.

07:28.640 --> 07:33.000
Frankly, the vice president knows
as well as anyone else it's too late for that.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.320
- If he didn't six years ago, he does now.
- What does that mean?

07:36.400 --> 07:41.000
He clearly doesn't want to shut the gate
down any more. He wants to control it.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.600
We have a civilian agency
known as the NID.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.920
Now, its mandate has been to keep an eye

07:50.000 --> 07:53.040
on top-secret projects
like the Stargate programme

07:53.120 --> 07:55.880
and has done so from the beginning.

07:55.960 --> 08:02.440
I propose that we give this organisation
direct control of the gate,

08:02.520 --> 08:05.000
effective immediately.

08:06.760 --> 08:11.440
<i>(Maynard) There's only one reason he
wanted them to give control to the NID.</i>

08:11.520 --> 08:15.360
He was about to become chairman
of the Intelligence Oversight Committee.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.880
Which would have put the NID
and the Stargate in his back pocket.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.120
He had the ambassadors in his hand.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.600
It was only because of extraordinary
intervention that it didn't work.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.120
- Hello?
- Hello.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.679
I am Thor,
Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.720
- Commander Thor, my name is...
- Senator Kinsey.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.480
O'Neill suggested I send you
to a distant planet for your actions here,

08:51.560 --> 08:54.720
but I am reasonably certain
his statement was in jest.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.520
- I'm sure it was, Commander.
- Supreme Commander.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.720
It is the opinion
of the Asgard High Council

09:02.800 --> 09:05.600
that Stargate Command
should be left in the hands

09:05.680 --> 09:09.040
of General Hammond and his team.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.120
And while our continued friendship
with Earth is not contingent on that,

09:13.200 --> 09:15.120
it is preferred.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.040
<i>(President)
I wonder why he wants it so badly.</i>

09:22.120 --> 09:26.600
I mean,
besides his belief in his divine right.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.320
I don't know, sir.

09:28.400 --> 09:35.360
Not that that's not enough, but I get this
feeling that there's something more to it.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
Yes, sir.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.680
That rogue element at NID that he took
credit for taking down last year...

09:43.760 --> 09:48.480
We've never had any proof connecting
Senator Kinsey to anything nefarious.

09:48.560 --> 09:54.200
I've got a bad feeling about where some
of that campaign financing came from.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.000
- Mr President.
- Did I say that out loud?

10:14.400 --> 10:17.080
Ah! Mr Woolsey.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.520
I hope my confidence in you
has not been misplaced.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.760
You have my word, sir.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.640
Once I finish,
the president will have no choice

10:26.720 --> 10:31.240
but to follow your recommendation
and clean house at Stargate Command.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.080
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

10:42.160 --> 10:45.640
but I was just wrapping up
a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.480
Francis,
I thought you'd want to sit in on this one.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.560
Thank you, sir.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.120
General, I don't believe
you know Richard Woolsey.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.720
For months,
he has been working with the NID

10:59.800 --> 11:04.120
conducting a thorough investigation
of all Stargate personnel.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.440
I've asked him here
to kindly present us with his findings.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.400
If this is a discussion of the competence
of those running the SGC,

11:11.480 --> 11:13.320
shouldn't Hammond be included?

11:13.400 --> 11:17.000
Unfortunately, sir,
General Hammond is part of the problem.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.400
George Hammond
is a highly decorated officer,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.600
a 30-year veteran with the Air Force,

11:22.680 --> 11:25.560
and while that may not carry
weight over at the NID,

11:25.640 --> 11:28.080
it still means something to certain people.

11:28.160 --> 11:32.640
This isn't a trial. Although it certainly
wouldn't surprise me if it came to that.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.640
Let's stick to specifics here.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.320
If these people need to be replaced,
I want to see evidence.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.320
Thank you, Mr President.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.720
The most recent incident
was less than a month ago.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.520
General Hammond
ordered an offworld rescue

11:47.600 --> 11:52.240
despite ample indication that he was
sending his people into an ambush.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.320
As a result, a very valuable member
of Stargate Command was killed.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.200
Dr Janet Fraiser.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.160
Sending people
into potentially dangerous situations

12:01.240 --> 12:03.920
is a natural consequence
of military command.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.800
Maybe so, but ignoring evidence
of an enemy trap

12:06.880 --> 12:10.040
is at best foolish
and at worst criminally negligent.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.360
General Hammond admits responsibility.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.240
His own report is essentially a confession.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.560
All that proves is the man
had the guts to own up to his mistakes.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.640
Unfortunately, in this case, mistakes can
lead to compromising the entire planet.

12:23.720 --> 12:28.760
I have a mountain of evidence implicating
not only Hammond but his first-line team.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.360
They are heroes.

12:30.440 --> 12:35.520
We have no intention of minimising the
accomplishments of the General or SG-1.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.600
Their respective achievements
speak for themselves,

12:38.680 --> 12:45.360
but intermittent successes
cannot excuse ongoing misconduct.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.400
Over the past seven years, SG-1 has
shown a disregard for military authority.

12:50.480 --> 12:55.680
They have compromised national security
and exercised extremely poor judgement.

12:55.760 --> 12:59.920
You should be on my speechwriting team.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.040
Come on, cut the crap, will you?

13:03.120 --> 13:10.920
As crazy as it sounds, we're talking about
people who are fighting aliens. Right?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.200
- Could we please be specific?
- Yes, sir.

13:16.480 --> 13:21.960
Let's start with insubordination. Five and
a half years ago, the gate was shut down.

13:22.040 --> 13:27.280
The SGC was under orders to suspend
all offworld travel, pending a full review.

13:27.360 --> 13:32.600
- SG-1 chose to ignore those orders.
- And managed to head off an invasion.

13:32.680 --> 13:38.400
Nonetheless, they were guilty. And it was
by no means an isolated incident.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.120
Let's go.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.240
O'Neill.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.240
Not this time, Teal'c.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.600
They sabotaged a mothership the Goa'uld
would have used to attack Earth.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.600
They used the Stargate
against a direct order of a superior officer.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.520
You can't hold them accountable for that.
Read the damn mission report.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.320
They were under the influence
of an alien device.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.440
Yes, of course. Which brings us
to the alarming frequency

14:47.520 --> 14:52.400
with which members
of SG-1 have fallen under alien influence.

14:52.480 --> 14:58.800
Major Samantha Carter.
Implanted with a Goa'uld symbiote.

14:58.880 --> 15:03.760
Then, two years ago,
her body became host to an alien virus.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.680
Daniel Jackson.

15:15.760 --> 15:20.160
Fell under the influence of alien
technology on numerous occasions,

15:20.240 --> 15:26.360
had his body play host to not one
but 12 alien psyches simultaneously.

15:26.440 --> 15:30.120
Most interestingly, apparently died,

15:30.200 --> 15:34.320
and, according to the report,
"evolved into a higher being."

15:50.520 --> 15:56.040
Teal'c, an alien,
former soldier of the Goa'uld,

15:56.120 --> 16:01.480
now possesses full security clearance
at our most secret facility.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.880
- He earned that trust.
- Yes.

16:03.960 --> 16:10.480
That trust almost cost SG-1 dearly
when he rejoined the ranks of Apophis.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.280
Buddy.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.000
What you got going here, Teal'c?

16:22.400 --> 16:27.960
Well done, Teal'c. Finally, you've resumed
your rightful position as my first prime.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.800
He'd been brainwashed by the enemy.

16:30.880 --> 16:36.280
Yes - like his fellow team members, he's
shown a vulnerability to alien influence.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.960
Which finally brings us
to the team leader, Jack O'Neill.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.840
Infected by alien contagions
a half-dozen times,

16:46.920 --> 16:51.520
experimented upon by
extraterrestrials another half-dozen times,

16:51.600 --> 16:56.240
had his memories manipulated
on numerous occasions.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.560
Had the entire repository
of an ancient alien database

16:59.640 --> 17:02.000
effectively downloaded into his head.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.920
Whoa!

17:11.319 --> 17:13.319
<i>(yells)</i>

17:14.680 --> 17:16.359
Colonel.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.319
Not long after this, the Colonel
began exhibiting strange behaviour,

17:20.400 --> 17:24.680
speaking an alien language,
demonstrating superhuman intellect.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.240
He was undergoing
some sort of transformation,

17:27.319 --> 17:29.640
as a result of the knowledge
he had absorbed.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.040
Were it not for the timely intervention
of another alien race,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.080
he would have been lost to us.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.120
How these people maintain
their sanity is beyond me.

17:38.200 --> 17:43.040
- I'm having trouble just listening to it.
- That, Mr President, is exactly my point.

17:43.120 --> 17:47.440
How can we trust these individuals
after everything they've been through?

17:47.520 --> 17:50.880
Well, they seem to be
handling it very well.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.880
But who's to say they are
completely free of these influences?

17:54.960 --> 17:58.120
They're routinely cleared
by medical professionals.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.960
We can no longer allow the Pentagon
to look the other way.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.480
The number of times the members
of SG-1 have been compromised

18:06.560 --> 18:10.640
should have warranted at least
a reconsideration of their offworld status,

18:10.720 --> 18:15.920
transfers to less decisive positions,
a couple of sick days, for God's sake.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.040
The first time I heard about this,
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

18:20.120 --> 18:24.720
I tried to imagine myself doing what these
people have been doing for seven years,

18:24.800 --> 18:30.080
and quite frankly, I don't think
any of us can really understand

18:30.160 --> 18:34.440
what they've been going through,
no matter how many files we read.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.520
All the more reason for intensive scrutiny.

18:37.600 --> 18:42.800
If new protocols and standards of conduct
need to be established,

18:42.880 --> 18:44.960
this is where it has to start.

18:51.640 --> 18:56.080
- What do you say we take a break?
- Yes, sir.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.840
You can't possibly be taking their side.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.040
- I need time to absorb this, Bob.
- We may not have much time.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.720
- The longer those people...
- Relax.

19:19.800 --> 19:25.400
All I'm saying is, at the moment, I'm going
to give them the benefit of the doubt.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.600
- I need to know more.
- I think you know all you need to know.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.720
That includes why you're here.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.920
I'm here, Bob,
because the people of this nation

19:35.000 --> 19:37.480
elected me to run their country.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.640
Not the whole damn galaxy.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.360
And this is my office, Bob, not yours,

19:44.440 --> 19:47.960
no matter what you may think you did
to make this happen.

19:48.040 --> 19:52.960
And don't you ever,
for one second, forget that.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.240
Yes, Mr President.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.280
Let's take a break.

20:11.400 --> 20:16.240
According to the military,
SGC is our first and best line of defence

20:16.320 --> 20:19.200
against potential alien threats
to this planet.

20:19.280 --> 20:23.200
If that's true,
we should be very, very concerned.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.520
Time and again, Hammond and SG-1 have
demonstrated shockingly poor judgement,

20:27.600 --> 20:32.640
placing themselves, the base,
this very planet, in jeopardy.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.600
The decision to bring back
suspect technology through the gate

20:37.680 --> 20:40.320
has precipitated
a number of crisis situations.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.480
For the most part,
they've been dealt within the SGC.

20:43.560 --> 20:48.760
However, last year the effect
of an alien device broke containment

20:48.840 --> 20:52.440
and found its way
into the civilian population.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
Son of a...

20:57.240 --> 21:01.560
Sir, I believe an individual I came in
contact with has breached the quarantine.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.200
<i>(yells)</i>

21:07.720 --> 21:10.920
The situation was taken care of.
A cover story was created.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.640
The civilian population
was none the wiser.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.520
I would like to know how many times
we'll have to clean up after these people.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.720
They have a mandate to acquire offworld
technology. That entails necessary risks.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.720
How would you define necessary?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.200
Only a few months ago,
General Hammond allowed

21:27.280 --> 21:30.040
the testing
of an unproven computer virus

21:30.120 --> 21:35.080
that shut down our entire gate network,
leaving us open to a potential assault.

21:35.160 --> 21:41.160
You can't hold Hammond responsible.
It was a Goa'uld modification of the virus.

21:41.240 --> 21:48.000
In other words, Hammond effectively gave
the Goa'uld a weapon to use against us.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.040
Like the president said,

21:50.120 --> 21:54.600
you can't even begin to understand
what their jobs demand of them.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.000
Maybe not, but I would like to think
that it includes common sense

21:59.080 --> 22:02.440
and the willingness to set aside
personal feelings in battle.

22:02.520 --> 22:06.680
- What are you referring to, Mr Woolsey?
- An incident three years ago.

22:06.760 --> 22:11.520
General Hammond allowed emotion to
override established gate-room protocol.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.520
Evacuate the gate room.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.760
Colonel O'Neill, we're taking fire. Report.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.640
Colonel O'Neill?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.480
Sir?

22:37.920 --> 22:40.400
Give them some more time.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.400
General Hammond's decision
to wait for SG-1 worked out in the end,

22:55.480 --> 23:00.040
but I can't help but wonder
if he'll be so lucky the next time.

23:00.800 --> 23:05.440
The members of SG-1 have similarly
suspect priorities - and no wonder.

23:05.520 --> 23:09.960
Not one, but two people that Dr Jackson
had close personal relationships with

23:10.040 --> 23:12.080
were taken as Goa'uld hosts.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.640
Teal'c's family and associates
among the ranks of the Jaffa

23:15.720 --> 23:20.520
make him an easy target
for Goa'uld retaliation and manipulation.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.360
Both O'Neill and Carter
have demonstrated

23:23.440 --> 23:29.160
an alarming tendency to let relationships
cloud their decision-making process.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.680
They have a right to their feelings.

23:32.760 --> 23:40.360
Unless, of course, you're suggesting...
some kind of inappropriate relationship.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.880
Inappropriate, yes.
That is exactly what he's suggesting.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.080
It's difficult to come away from
these reports without the impression

23:50.160 --> 23:54.240
that there's a lot more going on
between Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter

23:54.320 --> 23:57.800
than simple friendship and respect.

23:57.880 --> 24:04.040
For example, there was an incident
last year in which O'Neill went missing.

24:04.120 --> 24:08.200
Based on a report filed by one of the
scientists on the mission in question,

24:08.280 --> 24:11.480
Major Carter's behaviour
was erratic at best.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.800
This technology
is unlike anything we've come across.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.880
- I know.
- No reference, no way to interface.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.760
I'm working on it, Doctor.
As you should be.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.120
Right.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.840
Excuse me. Where's Colonel O'Neill?

24:31.920 --> 24:36.080
I don't see him, do you?
Did you guys find him while I was gone?

24:36.160 --> 24:38.760
I say when we're done here.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.520
That's it? That's your evidence?

24:44.600 --> 24:48.600
I believe there's a lot more to this
than we've been told.

24:48.680 --> 24:55.400
But I hardly expect them to incriminate
themselves with their own reports.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.120
But we can all read between the lines.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.200
All right, I've heard enough.
Thank you, gentlemen.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.840
- Thank you, Mr Woolsey.
- Mr President.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.760
<i>(knocking)</i>

25:18.840 --> 25:22.000
- Mr Woolsey is here to see you, sir.
- Send him in.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.800
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

25:31.280 --> 25:37.000
- That was nice work today, Richard.
- Really? I got the feeling it didn't go well.

25:37.080 --> 25:42.120
- Ah, well. Doesn't matter.
- It doesn't?

25:42.200 --> 25:45.560
Nah. The president
is going to come around.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.000
I didn't get that impression,
Mr Vice President.

25:50.080 --> 25:55.840
In fact, I clearly sensed that he was siding
with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

25:55.920 --> 26:02.560
Today was a formality. Don't get me
wrong. The job you did was vital.

26:02.640 --> 26:08.320
The president has to appear to be hearing
both sides, considering his position,

26:08.400 --> 26:11.040
but...

26:11.120 --> 26:13.200
he'll see things my way eventually.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.640
And if he doesn't?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Things happen.

26:22.120 --> 26:25.000
What is that supposed to mean?

26:26.640 --> 26:30.120
It means
you chose the right side, Richard.

26:31.560 --> 26:38.640
One way or another, I promise you,
I'm going to win this one.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.440
- Mr President.
- General.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.400
I take it you're here
to make a case for the defence?

26:55.480 --> 26:58.640
I'm not going to get
into a point-counterpoint.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.360
It may very well be
that Hammond and SG-1

27:01.440 --> 27:04.480
have done their very best
under difficult circumstances,

27:04.560 --> 27:09.680
but there's a political aspect to the vice
president's position that makes sense.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.880
Sir?

27:16.720 --> 27:21.840
A lot of people know about Stargate.
We can't keep it a secret forever.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.960
When it finally comes out,
we're going to be in the fight of our lives.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.480
We'll need the public's confidence.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.560
You think cleaning house at the SGC now
shows you're in control?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.560
You disagree?

27:34.640 --> 27:36.840
I think there's time for that still, sir.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.760
For the immediate future, I'm here
to let you know what you're up against,

27:40.840 --> 27:44.720
and why we need Hammond
and SG-1 right now more than ever.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.640
Have a seat. Fire away.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.040
The System Lords have proven
themselves to be formidable adversaries.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.360
Yet, despite our obvious disadvantage,

28:01.440 --> 28:05.120
we've managed to hold our own, maybe
even take them down a notch or two.

28:05.200 --> 28:09.520
We've been good, and we've been lucky.
But I'm afraid that could change.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.040
There's a new Goa'uld in the mix.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.880
I take it you're referring to the one
who calls himself Anubis.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.080
He's more powerful
than any of his predecessors.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.680
He came to our attention a year ago
when he tried to take out Earth

28:22.760 --> 28:27.000
with an asteroid and then used
our own Stargate as a weapon against us.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.240
We thwarted him both times.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.360
Since then,
he's redirected his attention to his rivals,

28:32.440 --> 28:35.120
waging a year-long war
against the Goa'uld.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.840
Your time is up.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.280
Well, good.
Let them fight amongst themselves.

28:59.360 --> 29:04.120
The problem is, when he's through
with them, and it's only a matter of time,

29:04.200 --> 29:09.680
he'll come gunning for us. And when he
does, we'll be facing a whole new threat.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.240
Fire in the hole!

29:38.680 --> 29:41.000
<i>(president) A super soldier?.</i>

29:41.080 --> 29:44.040
Not just one. He's got a whole army.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.960
<i>(massed voices) Hail Anubis. Hail Anubis.</i>

29:50.240 --> 29:54.160
If that's true, I can't imagine
how having SG-1 on the front lines

29:54.240 --> 29:57.160
is gonna make one bit
of difference when the time comes.

29:57.240 --> 30:01.120
Anubis may be incredibly powerful,
but he's not invincible.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.160
- There is a way to take him out.
- And how's that?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.320
By finding the lost city.

30:07.160 --> 30:13.000
You have to forgive me, Francis. I've only
gone through about a third of those files.

30:13.080 --> 30:19.040
The gates were built by a highly advanced
race of aliens known as the Ancients.

30:19.120 --> 30:24.200
They died off millions of years ago,
but they haven't disappeared completely.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.840
<i>They've evolved into higher life forms.</i>

30:44.920 --> 30:46.840
- Well, will they help us?
- No, sir.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.840
- Why the hell not?
- It's beneath them.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.920
They won't involve themselves
in our affairs.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
So where are you going with this?

30:57.080 --> 31:02.560
Last year, SG-1 made an amazing
discovery on a planet called Abydos.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.440
You're gonna find
the lost city of the Ancients.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.320
- Lost city?
- Didn't tell him about that either, huh?

31:09.400 --> 31:11.840
Daniel found a tablet about a lost city.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.600
With powerful weapons capable
of giving you a big advantage over Anubis.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.640
- Do you know where it is?
- No, but I'll help you find it.

31:18.720 --> 31:25.960
Hammond and SG-1 are close to finding
the lost city. Let them do their job, sir.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.880
Let them save this planet one more time.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
<i>(sighs)</i>

31:37.120 --> 31:39.320
I wish it were that simple.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.320
I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.640
The vice president may be a pain
in the ass, but I can't just ignore him.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.280
You're commander-in-chief.
It's your decision.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.760
True.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.000
But if I cross him on this one...

31:59.080 --> 32:04.560
Well, let's just say
that I haven't viewed all the angles yet.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.480
- Is there anything you haven't told me?
- No, sir.

32:11.720 --> 32:16.080
Then as far as I can tell, Hammond and
SG-1 have done an extraordinary job

32:16.160 --> 32:18.640
under very difficult circumstances.

32:18.720 --> 32:22.720
But in doing so
they've made some mistakes.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.440
They've made some enemies.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.560
Frankly,
I don't know if I can protect them.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.440
<i>(door opens)</i>

32:46.600 --> 32:48.520
- General.
- Mr Woolsey.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.440
Thank you for meeting me.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.360
The vice president
doesn't know about this?

32:53.440 --> 32:56.040
No. And I'd like to keep it that way.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.400
What do you want?

33:00.480 --> 33:02.680
I want to warn you.

33:02.760 --> 33:09.320
I think the vice president may be involved
with people capable of... well, anything.

33:09.400 --> 33:15.000
I believe they attempted assassination at
least once before to get what they wanted.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.000
Do you realise the seriousness
of what you just said?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.400
Yes, sir.

33:20.480 --> 33:26.320
Look, no matter what you think of me,
I consider myself to be a man of integrity.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.440
I took the job with the NID
because I strongly believe

33:29.520 --> 33:32.320
in civilian oversight of military operations.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.520
- Mr Woolsey.
- I don't have any proof, sir.

33:34.600 --> 33:41.240
But I'm starting to question whether those
to whom I have dedicated my allegiance

33:41.320 --> 33:44.520
are as honourable as I had hoped.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.440
You're a resourceful man, Mr Woolsey.

33:49.520 --> 33:53.360
If you think there's proof out there, find it.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.159
<i>(phone rings)</i>

34:09.840 --> 34:12.400
Hammond.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.080
Show him in.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.600
General.

34:21.679 --> 34:26.040
This must be important
for you to have come all this way.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.560
I know you have
no reason to trust me, General.

34:28.639 --> 34:32.040
That's why I felt
I had to come here in person.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.520
Sit down.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.920
I take great pride in my work, General.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.520
My job demands meticulous research.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.120
And above all else,
impartiality in its execution.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.600
My aim is to present an airtight argument,

34:49.679 --> 34:52.159
a point of view for consideration
by those I serve

34:52.239 --> 34:54.239
with no personal agenda whatsoever.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.800
Get to the point.

34:56.880 --> 35:01.640
I stand by my case against you and your
personnel, despite what I'm about to say.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.960
I hope you don't expect
that to gain my respect.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.080
You recall the assassination attempt
on then Senator Kinsey?

35:13.160 --> 35:15.160
<i>(applause)</i>

35:20.960 --> 35:22.680
<i>(screaming)</i>

35:22.760 --> 35:25.960
The senator's been hit. He's been hit.

35:27.160 --> 35:30.760
I later gained notoriety from bringing
those responsible to justice.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.520
I can only assume you're going
somewhere with this.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.480
Let's just say I've recently come to believe

35:37.560 --> 35:43.400
that those behind the rogue element of
the NID have not entirely been eliminated.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.520
In fact, they may be stronger than ever,

35:45.600 --> 35:48.680
and Vice President Kinsey
may still be tied to them.

35:48.760 --> 35:53.920
They tried to have him killed, then he tried
to take them down. Seems unlikely.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.320
At the time, something must have
made Kinsey a liability.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.960
After the assassination attempt,
the opportunity presented itself

36:01.040 --> 36:03.720
to propel Kinsey
onto the presidential ticket.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.120
That could have
motivated a reconciliation.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.160
Either way, I'm not surprised
by any of this, Mr Woolsey.

36:09.240 --> 36:13.680
Well, I'm sorry to say that I am, and I want
to do something about it if I can.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.840
- Like what?
- Like present evidence, if there is any,

36:17.920 --> 36:22.080
connecting Kinsey to illegal activity
involving those behind the rogue NID.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.360
What makes you think
evidence like that exists?

36:25.440 --> 36:28.240
- Because you're sitting right there.
- I'm sorry?

36:28.320 --> 36:32.920
Three years ago, you left SGC,
supposedly retired.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.520
- I'm guessing you were blackmailed.
- And?

36:37.600 --> 36:39.680
And then you came back.

36:39.760 --> 36:43.080
Nothing about that
ever made any sense to me.

36:43.160 --> 36:46.400
I want to know why, how.

36:47.640 --> 36:52.240
You've got something on Kinsey,
something I can use.

36:55.120 --> 37:00.120
<i>(Hacker) That's it, we're in.
I'm downloading now.</i>

37:01.640 --> 37:08.000
Kinsey's online activities connect him to
NID actions over the last year and a half,

37:08.080 --> 37:13.960
including a secret operation I ran out of
Area 51, involvement with the Russians...

37:16.480 --> 37:18.480
and the threats to Hammond.

37:18.560 --> 37:23.600
You're a piece of work, Kinsey.
Tried to shut down the SGC.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.880
You make this big speech
about hating secret organisations,

37:26.960 --> 37:29.000
then jump in bed with the NID?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.160
<i>(Hacker) I'm done.</i>

37:37.640 --> 37:41.800
What are you going to do?
Take down the whole NID?

37:41.880 --> 37:43.640
Nope.

37:44.720 --> 37:50.880
Here's the deal. Get them to reinstate
Hammond or this disk goes to the press.

37:55.640 --> 38:00.280
You've got connections, General.
You must know what's going down.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.920
That's not the only copy.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.560
Why haven't you given this
to someone before now?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.680
I didn't know who to trust.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.160
I still don't.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.680
<i>(phone rings)</i>

38:42.920 --> 38:44.920
Yes, sir, right away.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.520
- The president will see you now.
- Thank you.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.840
Thank you for seeing me, Mr President.

39:01.920 --> 39:06.400
Is there something you wanted
to add to your report, Mr Woolsey?

39:06.480 --> 39:09.000
Yes, sir.

39:13.640 --> 39:18.040
As I'm sure you're aware, the NID
does not exactly have a spotless record.

39:18.120 --> 39:23.000
For several years, a group of rogue
agents operated inside of its ranks.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.680
They acted on behalf of a cabal
of international business interests

39:26.760 --> 39:30.120
intent on acquiring alien technology
for their own profit.

39:30.200 --> 39:34.400
- One could only hope.
- Mr President?

39:35.520 --> 39:37.880
I know they're out there, Mr Woolsey.

39:37.960 --> 39:44.440
I'm saying that one could only hope
that money was their chief motivation.

39:46.160 --> 39:50.000
However, I doubt
the type of person who is behind this

39:50.080 --> 39:54.920
is short-sighted enough for that,
given what he must know.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.800
In light of the new reality
that Stargate presents,

39:59.880 --> 40:06.480
there are aspirations beyond mere
financial greed that could be much worse.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.200
I agree.

40:10.280 --> 40:14.080
You're here to tell me that the vice
president is still in league with them?

40:14.160 --> 40:18.600
If these people are as powerful as
we both think, it does make one wonder

40:18.680 --> 40:24.040
what the vice president offered them
in exchange for the price on his head.

40:24.120 --> 40:29.920
Obviously, the full control of the Stargate
programme that the White House affords.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.040
The vice president brought key financing
to your campaign victory.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.720
I just hope
it didn't come at too high a cost.

40:45.640 --> 40:49.040
I also hope history one day shows that...

40:50.440 --> 40:52.680
I tried to do the right thing.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.400
Whose version of history, Mr Woolsey?

40:57.305 --> 41:03.280
