01:10.271 --> 01:13.341
Editing this newsletter
is taking more time
than I thought it would.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.644
Well, at least we have
Mr. Bentley's
electric typewriter.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.214
And it types a lot faster
than my old manual machine.

01:29.523 --> 01:33.161
* Every time it snows
it snows pennies
from heaven *

01:33.227 --> 01:34.695
(VOCALIZING)

01:35.529 --> 01:37.498
You mean every time it rains?

01:37.565 --> 01:39.400
Yeah, that too, Weezy,
but right now it's snowing.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.970
And snow means slush,
and slush means dirty clothes.
And dirty clothes means...

01:43.036 --> 01:46.073
* There'll be pennies
from heaven for you and me! *

01:49.943 --> 01:51.479
Florence, what are we
having for lunch?

01:51.545 --> 01:54.315
I don't know about you,
but I'm having split pea soup.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.885
Looks kind of thin.
What happened to the peas?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.653
I don't know.
Maybe they split.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.359
(GEORGE LAUGHING)

02:05.426 --> 02:07.728
Well, you better split
into the kitchen
and find me something to eat.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.698
Okay. As soon as I finish my
soup. I can't work on
an empty stomach.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.001
You can't work on
no kind of stomach.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.938
And speaking of stomachs...

02:18.772 --> 02:20.040
Hi, George, is Helen here?

02:20.107 --> 02:21.409
Yeah, unfortunately.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.578
-Helen, great news,
Jack Foreman's got the flu.
-What?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.915
And the company's sending me
to the publishers convention
in his place.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.019
-Four beautiful days
in sunny Acapulco!
-Oh, that's nice.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.354
And you're going with me.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.655
Oh, that's terrific!

02:35.923 --> 02:37.024
When are you leaving, Tom?

02:37.090 --> 02:38.692
This afternoon.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.794
Now, Helen,
if you start packing,
then I can start reading this.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.664
What's that?
It's the book I'll be
promoting at the convention.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.733
"How To Make Your Man Happy."

02:45.799 --> 02:47.635
Hmm, maybe I ought to
read that.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.503
Florence, I know how you can
make any man happy.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.339
Keep away from him.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.812
Excuse me, y'all.
Maybe I'd better get
Mr. Jefferson his pea soup.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.081
It should go perfect
with his pea brain.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.621
Is this book for real?
Listen to this.

03:07.688 --> 03:11.725
"Obedience in a wife is as
important as it is in a dog."

03:11.792 --> 03:15.496
-Um, I don't agree
with that at all.
-I should hope not.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.465
I think it's more important.

03:25.473 --> 03:30.043
-Tom, you mean you're actually
going to promote this book?
-Sure. Why not?

03:30.110 --> 03:33.847
-Well, because it's a lot
of sexist nonsense.
-It's also my job.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.650
And without a job,
how am I supposed
to support you?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.852
-Support me?
-Yes.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.656
Wait a minute.
Are you saying that in order
to get along in this world,

03:42.723 --> 03:46.093
-a woman needs a man
to support her?
-I didn't say that at all.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.962
-Oh, come on, let's get going.
-Our plane leaves
in four hours.

03:49.029 --> 03:53.301
Well, I'm not so sure
that I want to go to Acapulco
with a chauvinist.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.937
I thought Tom
was an Episcopalian.

03:57.004 --> 04:01.975
-Helen, I'm not a chauvinist.
-Then why are you promoting
that chauvinistic book?

04:02.042 --> 04:05.979
Well, because... Oh, come on,
we can talk about this
on the way to the airport.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.981
Now, Helen, stop acting silly.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.050
Silly?

04:10.117 --> 04:13.321
I've got a better suggestion.
Why don't you just go
to Acapulco by yourself?

04:13.387 --> 04:15.689
By myself?
Well, Helen, I want you
to go with me.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.893
-Why?
-Well, I don't do so well
by myself.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.194
Do what?

04:23.230 --> 04:26.367
That's precisely the point.

04:26.434 --> 04:30.003
Oh, so that's the only reason
you want me along, huh?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.573
Well, no thank you, Tom.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.642
Helen,
I'm going upstairs to pack,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.144
and then I'm going
to the office
to pick up the tickets.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.612
Are you coming with me or not?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.848
I've made up my mind.

04:40.914 --> 04:44.718
This is one woman who has
better things to do than
just make her man happy.

04:44.785 --> 04:50.358
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.
We might have had a good time.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.761
Is there anything
you'd like me to get
while I'm in Mexico?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.229
Yeah.
Montezuma's revenge.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.238
-Helen, are you sure
you did the right thing?
-Of course.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.575
I'm not going anywhere
with a hypocrite.

05:07.641 --> 05:12.480
Oh, Helen, don't you think
calling Tom a hypocrite
is going too far?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.816
Yeah.
Why don't you just call him
a hippo and let it go at that?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.123
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:23.190 --> 05:24.958
Send him in, please.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.331
Well, Willis, I thought you'd
taken off by now.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.435
But then you probably decided
to wait for the plane, huh?

05:34.502 --> 05:37.170
(GUFFAWING)

05:37.237 --> 05:40.908
-Well, actually, J.R., I just
stopped by for the tickets.
-Right, right.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.176
I guess the little lady's
excited, huh?

05:43.243 --> 05:46.814
Well, uh, she had some
volunteer work to do, J.R.,
so she decided not to go.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.082
Oh well, that's too bad.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.852
I was hoping my wife
might be able to
spend some time with Helen

05:51.919 --> 05:56.690
so I could have a little
spare time for myself.
Huh? Huh?

05:56.757 --> 06:00.694
-Well, I'm sorry, J.R.
-Say, since, uh,
Helen isn't going with you,

06:00.761 --> 06:01.795
I have a thought.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.931
A thought?

06:03.997 --> 06:08.936
-Yeah. You know Judy Smith,
in the secretarial pool?
-Oh, yes, I, I've seen her.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.037
Yeah, she's hard to miss, huh?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.339
(LECHEROUS CHUCKLE)

06:12.406 --> 06:16.877
Anyhow, I thought it might be
nice for me to have her along
at the convention. Huh? Huh?

06:16.944 --> 06:19.279
Oh, oh, I understand, J.R.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.950
I'm sure she's a very devoted,
um, um, employee.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.585
Indeed she is, Willis.

06:24.652 --> 06:29.089
She's willing to work nights
and sometimes, um, weekends.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.225
Right. Whoa, gosh.
Look at the time.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.763
-Say, Tom,
I just had another thought.
-Another thought?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.666
Yeah. I think I might
just send Miss Smith
along with you

06:38.732 --> 06:40.233
as your assistant.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.935
An assistant?

06:42.002 --> 06:44.638
Oh, really, J.R.,
I don't think I'll have enough
for a girl to do.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.340
I will.

06:47.407 --> 06:53.046
Besides, if Miss Smith
is with you, my wife
will never know a thing.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.749
How's that sound, Tom?

06:55.816 --> 06:57.718
Well, to tell you the truth,
J.R.,

06:57.785 --> 07:00.420
-it sounds like cheating.
-I'm not asking you
to define it,

07:00.488 --> 07:02.456
I'm asking you to do it.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.892
Well, with all respect, J.R.,
I'd rather not.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.629
Oh. Okay, Tom.
Your decision.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.431
I respect that.

07:11.499 --> 07:15.068
By the way, you're a
vice president now, right?

07:15.135 --> 07:18.772
-Right, J.R.
-There were,
last time I counted them,

07:18.839 --> 07:21.975
-five other vice presidents,
right?
-Right again.

07:22.042 --> 07:27.848
-Oh, Tom, you know...
You know, I've always
admired your work.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.383
I'm gonna retire in a year,
and when I do,

07:30.450 --> 07:32.853
I'll have a lot to say
about who takes over.

07:32.920 --> 07:37.257
Tell me, Willis,
how'd you like to see
your nameplate on this desk?

07:37.324 --> 07:40.994
-Oh, I'd love to, J.R.
-Then all you have to do
is play ball.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.996
Are you with me?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

07:43.063 --> 07:45.799
-Well...
-Good.
Send Miss Smith in, please.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.203
Willis, I think we're gonna
make quite a team.

You're going
to Acapulco after all.

-I am?
-Yeah.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.160
Boy. (GIGGLES)
This is so exciting.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.328
You know, I've never been
to Acapulco before.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.431
I've wanted to go ever since
I was a little girl.

08:18.498 --> 08:24.304
Well, Judy, now that you're
a big girl, Acapulco will be
that much more fun.

08:24.371 --> 08:27.374
-J.R., the time...
-Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.942
Now, Judy,
you have to get going.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.412
Now, you'll be flying
with Mr. Willis.
Is that okay?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.416
I guess so.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.819
Well, I better go
make myself pretty.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.528
She's quite a girl,
isn't she, Tom?

08:48.596 --> 08:49.597
If you say so, J.R.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.131
I do.

08:51.198 --> 08:55.135
And, Willis,
if word of this gets out
to anybody, anybody,

08:55.202 --> 08:59.006
it's my reputation
and your job.
Any questions?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.775
Just one, J.R.
Do you have any Rolaids?

09:08.181 --> 09:12.119
Helen, I think this
fundraising article should
go on Page 3, don't you?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.022
Helen?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.826
Helen, your hair's on fire.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.962
That's nice.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.799
Helen, you can't work here
if you're off someplace else.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.302
-Someplace else?
-You were in Mexico.
I could see it.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.740
You're right, Louise.
I was.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.541
Well, you can still
make that flight.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.710
Maybe I was wrong.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.445
About the book?

09:38.511 --> 09:43.016
No, Tom.
He's not really a chauvinist.
And it is his job.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.786
And it is 85 degrees
in Acapulco.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.156
Yeah.

09:49.222 --> 09:53.460
If I hurry, I should be able
to get to the airport
in plenty of time.

Mr. Willis, how come
you're so nervous?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.245
Nervous?
I'm not nervous.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.783
Oh, do you always chew gum
with the wrapper on?

10:52.352 --> 10:55.555
I just like to keep
the flavor in.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.458
Well, you'll relax
when you get to Acapulco.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.560
There's this cute little bar
called Jose's.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.796
I thought you'd
never been to Acapulco.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.066
Oh no.
I just told J.R. that.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.901
You see, I want to
keep him happy.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.203

you're doing a good job.

I sometimes get a little
nervous when I fly.

if I held your hand
on the plane?

somebody else's hand?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.655

little teddy bear's we saw
back at the gift shop.

-Oh, Mr. Willis,
you're so sweet.
-Yes.

for you. Be right back.

Oh, that's wonderful.

Are you going
to Acapulco on
business or pleasure?

12:21.942 --> 12:25.678
You know,
I'm really not sure
how to answer that.

12:29.182 --> 12:33.286
Well, I better go take
my air sickness pills.
I don't want to be dizzy.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.878
I'm going with you.
Louise made me see
how silly I was.

12:57.945 --> 13:02.749
-Honey, I'm sorry about
the whole situation.
-So am I. Very sorry.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.485
-What are you doing
with this teddy bear?
-Oh, this?

13:05.552 --> 13:09.056
Oh well, I, I just bought it
so I wouldn't be lonesome
on the plane.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.424
-What?
-Oh no, I'm just kidding,
Helen.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.662
I really brought it
for this little boy over here.
He looked so lonely.

13:15.728 --> 13:19.299
Here, little boy.
How'd you like to have a
brand new teddy bear?

13:21.668 --> 13:24.604
How many times
have I told you not to
take things from strangers?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.874
Pervert!

13:30.677 --> 13:33.180
Tom. Tom, is there
something wrong?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.849
Wrong? Wrong?
What makes you think
something's wrong?

13:35.916 --> 13:38.251
Well, honey, why are you
squirming around like that?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.788
Well, because, because I...

13:41.855 --> 13:43.790
(WHISPERS)
Because I have to go
to the bathroom.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.734
-Do you know how long
the flight will last?
-I'm not sure.

13:54.801 --> 13:58.071
You see, the last time
I lost track
after my fifth margarita.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.242
Well, if you had
five margarita's

14:02.309 --> 14:06.113
you must have landed
an hour after the plane did.

14:06.179 --> 14:11.885
Miss Smith, Miss Judy Smith,
please go up to the flight
information counter.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.923
That's me!
I'll be right back.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.293
Ah!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.595
Tom, what are you doing?

14:22.662 --> 14:23.997
I'm going to the bathroom.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.366
Here?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.401
Of course not.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.004
-But I thought you already
went to the bathroom.
-Well, I did, but, um I...

14:31.071 --> 14:33.273
I forgot to put in the dime.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.385
Judy.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.220
Oh hi, Mr. Willis.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.723
I think it would be
a better idea
if you took a later flight.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.759
-Why?
-Well, because I don't
want you to miss

14:52.825 --> 14:55.528
that glorious Mexican sunset.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.197
-But, why...
-Oh, it's important.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.532
I know J.R.
would want it this way.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.335
-But what about you?
-Oh, and I want it this way,
too.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.338
Now here, this will cover
your ticket.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.808
Okay, Mr. Willis.
Then I'll see you
in Acapulco.

15:21.421 --> 15:26.026
-Oh, Tom, I can't wait until
we get to Acapulco.
-Oh, neither can I.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.461
-Maybe we ought to try
and get on the plane now.
-Why?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.065
-Oh, we don't wanna miss it.
-Oh, Tom, why don't you
just relax?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.534
We have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.804
Oh, of course, Helen,
you're right.
I was just acting silly.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.739
Mr. Willis?

15:39.806 --> 15:40.873
Yes? (GASPS)

15:43.376 --> 15:45.312
You forgot to give me
my teddy bear.

15:45.378 --> 15:49.882
-That's your teddy bear?
-Yes. Mr. Willis
bought it for me.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.486
Excuse me. I have to go
to the bathroom again.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.626
You know Tom?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.261
Oh, sure.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.564
We're going to be spending
four days in Acapulco
together.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.566
Now, Helen...

16:06.633 --> 16:07.967
Four days, huh?

16:08.035 --> 16:11.238
-Well, actually,
it's only three days.
-But it's four nights.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.641
Tom, what...

16:15.875 --> 16:17.610
You, you cheat!

16:17.677 --> 16:20.313
Oh now, Helen...
Helen, wait!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.783
Did I say something wrong?

16:28.788 --> 16:33.526
After all these years,
how could Tom do such a thing?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.463
Are you sure
you're not mistaken?

16:36.529 --> 16:40.667
-Louise, I know what I saw.
I'm not blind.
-No, just color blind.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.208
George, can't you be
more considerate?

16:48.275 --> 16:53.180
-Helen needs kindness and
understanding.
-Yeah, you're right, Weez.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.916
Look, Helen,
I'm sorry your old man
dumped you for a floozy.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.754
-Is there anything
I can do to help?
-Yeah.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.056
Shut up.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.592
(DOORBELL RINGING)

17:05.658 --> 17:08.295
I've always told you
mixed marriages don't work.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.331
Tom and Helen have been
married for 28 years.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.032
See?
It was just a matter of time.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.338
Hey, Willis,
you old sly dog, you.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.576
-Helen.
-Keep your hands to yourself.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.212
That's right.
If you'd done that
in the first place,

17:25.278 --> 17:27.180
you wouldn't be in this mess.

17:29.882 --> 17:34.287
-Keep out of this, George.
It isn't your affair.
-Oh, that's right, Weezy.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.988
It's his affair. Hey!

17:36.989 --> 17:38.925
George, it's not an affair.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.629
-Oh, so it's gone beyond that.
-Helen, it hasn't gone
anywhere.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.831
It almost went to Acapulco.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.570
George, stay out of this!
Their marriage is in
enough trouble already!

17:50.637 --> 17:51.771
Oh, Louise!

17:51.838 --> 17:54.241
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.844
Helen, I know what it must
have looked like,
but you made a big mistake.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.347
Yeah. I married you.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.182
That girl you saw me with,
she means nothing to me.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.017
-What we were doing
was strictly business.
-Business?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.919
How much did you
have to pay her?

18:06.986 --> 18:09.589
-I didn't have to pay her
anything.
-She works for free?

18:10.623 --> 18:13.326
Yes. I mean, no.
No, I mean, not for me.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.396
But, Helen, look,
I'm here with you.
I'm not on the plane.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.065
That's just too bad, Tom,
because if you were
on the plane,

18:19.132 --> 18:23.102
-at least you'd have
a place to sleep tonight.
-Helen!

18:23.170 --> 18:27.307
-Oh, what am I gonna do?
-Well, the way I see it,
Willis, you got two choices.

18:27.374 --> 18:31.178
The Holiday Inn or the YMCA.

18:31.244 --> 18:35.282
-George, don't be ridiculous.
-You believe me,
don't you, Louise?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.651
Tom, if you say there was
nothing to it, I believe you.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.820
But I'm not the one
you have to convince.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.890
Oh, I wish Helen were as
open-minded as you, Louise.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.058
I've had a lot of practice.

18:48.161 --> 18:52.999
-Maybe if I spoke to Helen...
-Oh, would you?
Oh, I'd be eternally grateful.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.234
Oh, I'd be forever
in your debt.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.136
I'd be... I'd be able to sleep
at home tonight.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.571
I'll give it a try, Tom.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.939
Oh, thank you, thank you.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.976
Look, Willis,
don't let this get you down.

19:04.043 --> 19:07.347
-I mean, there's an easy way
to get out of this.
-Oh? How?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.115
Just get a better lawyer
than Helen.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.719
Lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.323
The hell you don't.
You know
the rules of romance.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.891
You wanna play, you gotta pay.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.960
George, Helen and I
are happily married.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.162
At least we were
until this afternoon.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.398
Don't worry, Willis.
I won't desert you
in your time of need.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.334
Oh, thanks, George.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.102
After you get divorced,
all your dry cleaning
will be half-price.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.944
George,
I'm not getting a divorce!

19:38.010 --> 19:40.146
Yeah, your girlfriend
ain't gonna like that.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.316
-She's not my girlfriend.
I love Helen.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

19:43.383 --> 19:45.418
What could I possibly want
with Judy Smith?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.323
Hi. I'm Judy Smith.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.091
Well, Willis, if you don't
know what to do with this,

19:52.158 --> 19:53.860
Helen ain't got
nothing to worry about.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.400
Miss Smith,
what are you doing here?

20:00.467 --> 20:02.769
Luckily you told me you were
going home.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.504
But how did you know
where I live?

20:04.571 --> 20:07.607
Luckily I had the office
directory in my purse.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.976
But how did you know
I'd be in this apartment?

20:10.042 --> 20:14.281
-Luckily the doorman told me.
-Sounds like you had
a lot of luck today.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.385
Too bad I can't say
the same for you.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.720
-Say, why don't you
have a seat?
-Uh, just a moment.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.756
(WHISPERS) George!
Look, what are you doing?
She can't stay here.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.891
Why not?

20:24.957 --> 20:26.393
Because of you-know-who.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.729
Don't worry, Willis.
God forgives everybody.

20:29.796 --> 20:34.033
-I'm talking about Helen!
-Don't worry about Helen.
I was wrong.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.203
I know now there's no way
that you and Judy
could have had a, you know.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.139
Thank you, George.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.241
I mean, one look at this fox,
and I know there's no way

20:42.309 --> 20:44.544
that she would go out
with a meatball like you.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.116
Mr. Willis,
what about our trip?

20:50.182 --> 20:55.755
Here. You go.
If you hurry, you can still
catch the last flight.

20:55.822 --> 21:00.460
-But what about you?
-Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.130
-But what will I tell J.R.?
-Look, dear,
you tell J.R. that...

21:04.731 --> 21:05.832
Tom!

21:16.676 --> 21:19.211
Now, Helen, don't start
jumping to conclusions.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.614
The only thing I'm gonna
jump to is your throat.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.751
Hey, what are you doing here?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.086
I'm here to see my husband.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.621
Oh, is he your husband?

21:28.688 --> 21:30.122
Hey, watch your mouth.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.792
I'm her husband.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.894
What? You mean...

21:34.961 --> 21:36.896
-You two are...
-That's right, Miss Smith.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.367
Smith? Couldn't you two
do better than that?

21:40.433 --> 21:43.202
Helen, Miss Smith
wasn't going to Mexico
to be with me.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.372
She was going to be with
somebody else.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.706
Yeah? Who?

21:46.773 --> 21:48.274
Who? I can't tell you.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.377
Well, you've just told me
all I wanna know.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.012
All right, Helen, go ahead.
There's no point in trying to
hide it any longer.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.782
I've been madly in love
with Judy for a long time now.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.017
-You have?
-Yes.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.287
Oh, Judy, from the first time
I laid eyes on you,
I knew I had to have you.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.856
Oh, I know what we planned
in, in Acapulco,

22:03.923 --> 22:06.826
but when we get there,
I'm not sharing you
with anyone.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.530
But what will
Mr. Kramer say?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.532
-Mr. Kramer?
-(GASPS)

22:13.933 --> 22:16.436
Are you messing around
with Tom's boss?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.170
Not anymore I'm not.

22:18.237 --> 22:21.374
Here, you keep this.
I don't need the aggravation.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.243
My dentist is just dying
to take me to Aspen.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.815
What am I gonna tell
Mr. Kramer?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.983
Tell him I'm having
my teeth fixed.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.820
Boy, what does he think I am?
A home-wrecker?

22:52.038 --> 22:56.242
Oh, Tom, I was so wrong.
How can I ever
make it up to you?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.411
-Get a job.
-What?

22:58.478 --> 23:02.715
Because when that plane lands
in Acapulco without Judy
on it, I'm gonna lose mine.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.085
Tom, do you really think you
could get fired over this?

23:06.152 --> 23:07.787
Why not?
He almost got divorced.

23:09.956 --> 23:14.393
Now, Tom, don't you worry.
Mr. Kramer
isn't gonna fire anybody.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.429
-Who's gonna stop him?
-I am.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.297
-You?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:18.364 --> 23:21.568
Remember,
Mrs. Kramer and I
have lunch once a month.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.736
Well, so what?
She doesn't even
know about Judy.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.238
She will if Mr. Kramer
tries to fire you.

23:27.339 --> 23:30.176
Oh, Helen, you're beautiful!

23:32.679 --> 23:36.148
And I'll be even more
beautiful lying on the beach
in Acapulco.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.517
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

23:37.584 --> 23:40.252
-Let's go.
-Right.

23:40.319 --> 23:44.724
-Oh, I don't know what to say.
Goodbye or adios?
-Whichever's quicker.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.394
-Adios.
-Hasta luego.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.699
Have fun.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.568
Boy, Helen sure was dumb
getting mad at Tom.

23:55.635 --> 23:59.138
Well, I know how I'd feel
if I saw you at the airport
with that girl.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.473
Look, Weezy, you don't have
to worry about me.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.174
I'd never go out
with a woman like that.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.276
-Honest, George?
-Never!

24:04.343 --> 24:05.712
Oh, George...

24:05.778 --> 24:07.113
Not unless she was black.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.751
-What?
-It was just a joke, Weezy.
Hey!
