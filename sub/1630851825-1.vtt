01:23.917 --> 01:25.377
Hi, Amanda.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.337
Good morning.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.589
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.970
Hey, honey, laundry's done.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.806
Amanda. No, no, no.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.822
- Let's hear it, Amanda. Come on.
- Yeah.

01:53.905 --> 01:54.905
All right.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.676
Happy birthday, Amanda.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.692
Good, good, good.
All right, good job, everybody.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.069
We'll see you tomorrow at 5 pm.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.280
So eat well, rest well.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.867
And if anyone has any problems,
don't let me know.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.870
All right, good.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.206
Amanda.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.627
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.442
- What's up, Rick?
- Come on, guys.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
Oh, how's it going, man?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.279
That's a nice bag, man.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.531
- Please, stop it.
- Oh, this is nice.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.326
- Give me my bag back.
- It is pretty nice.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.828
Come on, I'm gonna be late to class.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.540
Come on, please.
Give it back. Stop, please.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.436
- Hey, honey, I'm exhausted.
- I'm gonna crash.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.938
Just call him right now.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.192
Bye-bye.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.421
Hi, I was just around the corner.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.883
I just thought
I'd bring you some supplies.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.219
Did you come to bring supplies,

09:55.261 --> 09:57.097
or to watch the concerto?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.223
Both.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.856
Some of this food's had an anniversary.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.110
Anything else you want me to bring?

10:10.193 --> 10:12.654
No, I have everything I need.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.655
Love.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.614
What?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.449
Love is all you need.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.913
What's new?
See Rob's working on his heart attack.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.374
Kate's got a new boyfriend.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.376
- Fucking hated the other one.
- Leave me alone.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.045
- Rick's still being bullied.
- Stop. Come on.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.757
Come on, please.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.509
Leave me alone. Stop.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.724
When's luiza getting married?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.104
Will?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.439
All information is in her cabinet.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.526
Yeah, I know,
but when's she getting married?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.069
In eight days.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.028
Oh, perfect.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.864
Got a window there.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.282
Thanks for the invite.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.534
Beautiful dress.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.878
Fernando's doing much better.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.511
Right, she's heading to the concerto.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.015
What time does it start?

11:23.725 --> 11:24.767
At 6.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.814
So why's she driving so fast?

12:00.136 --> 12:01.136
Will.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.223
What did you say?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.975
Have you seen anything different?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.319
Yes?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.488
She had some problems sleeping.

12:21.532 --> 12:25.245
But she always had problems sleeping
before big concertos.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.914
Well...

12:30.625 --> 12:31.625
Well...

12:33.211 --> 12:35.713
Nothing we do now
is gonna change anything.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.772
I heard her tires squeal.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.501
Try to get some rest, eh?

13:16.587 --> 13:18.798
Tomorrow you got a lot of work to do.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.935
Do you like it, Amanda?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.161
Who did you draw here, Amanda?

13:48.244 --> 13:49.537
- My friend.
- Yeah?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.206
Is this the friend that we never see?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.333
The friend again.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.753
Do you ever talk to your friend?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.714
Not really, but he's always with me.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.884
What's your friend's name?

14:02.967 --> 14:03.801
Will.

14:03.885 --> 14:04.886
His name is will.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.451
Please, come in.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.122
Thank you.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.212
My name is will, by the way.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.841
May I call you...

15:32.557 --> 15:33.557
Sure.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.644
May I take your picture?

15:37.687 --> 15:38.688
My pleasure.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.904
How old are you, Anne?

15:46.988 --> 15:47.988
Foun

15:48.364 --> 15:50.408
four minutes?

15:50.992 --> 15:51.992
Four hours.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
And some minutes.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.832
When did you learn how to speak?

15:57.915 --> 15:59.125
I don't know.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.378
I think I always knew how to speak.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.130
Do you know why you're here?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.298
Strangely, yes.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.968
Do you mind if I say it out loud,
just to make it official?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.051
Okay.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.972
As you know,

16:13.639 --> 16:17.810
you are being considered
for the amazing opportunity of life.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.272
If, after this process, you are selected,

16:21.355 --> 16:25.735
you will have the chance
to be born in a fruitful environment

16:25.818 --> 16:26.986
where you can grow,

16:27.069 --> 16:28.738
develop,

16:28.821 --> 16:29.822
and accomplish.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.617
Would you like
to be considered for this position?

16:32.700 --> 16:33.784
I would.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.996
Before we get started, may I call you...

16:37.079 --> 16:38.080
Mike?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.876
Alexander?

16:41.959 --> 16:42.960
Kane?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.094
Do you have any questions?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.850
- Am I dead?
- I wouldn't say you're alive or dead.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.393
Are you the boss?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.187
I would say, a cog in the wheel.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.981
That sounds intense.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.858
How long is this process?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.652
Hard to pinpoint exactly,

17:07.734 --> 17:10.238
but if you make it
until the end, nine days.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.490
- So I have nine days.
- Yes.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.449
Or less.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.532
After that?

17:14.575 --> 17:15.701
If you're selected,

17:15.785 --> 17:18.496
there is an extension as a newborn.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.958
If not, I would say it's the end.

17:22.541 --> 17:26.503
By "extension," do you mean
I carry on the memories from here?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.881
No. No memories.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.342
But you'll still be you.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.303
What's the difference between

17:35.221 --> 17:36.221
being here

17:37.014 --> 17:38.182
and being alive?

17:38.266 --> 17:43.104
Any feeling, sensation, emotion,

17:43.187 --> 17:44.939
much less intense here.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.649
How can you be so sure of that?

17:47.483 --> 17:50.486
Because of a previous experience
as a living person.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.196
So you were picked.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.284
You sat where I sat, and you won.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.791
And what did you achieve
as a living person?

18:06.961 --> 18:10.339
Unfortunately I can't answer
any questions on the subject.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.050
Okay.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.514
I have a task for you.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.519
No right or wrong answer.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.732
Just say whatever comes to mind.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.656
You gonna sit there?

18:35.740 --> 18:38.492
From here on, you're not Anne anymore.

18:40.077 --> 18:44.373
You are a war prisoner
in a concentration camp.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.836
You were sent here yesterday
with your 11-year-old son, Nick.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.714
Very smart boy, but quite rebellious too.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.635
This morning, Nick tried to escape,

18:55.718 --> 18:57.803
but was caught by a sadistic guard

18:57.887 --> 19:00.264
who wants to hang him.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.348
Nick is right here...

19:03.267 --> 19:04.644
Standing on this chair,

19:05.311 --> 19:06.646
with a cord...

19:08.189 --> 19:09.482
Around his neck.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.611
This small piece of furniture
is the only thing preventing

19:13.694 --> 19:15.780
your beloved son from being killed,

19:16.489 --> 19:19.950
when the guard says, "pull the chair."

19:22.370 --> 19:23.371
Pull the chair.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.122
Pull the chair. Pull the chair.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.666
My god.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.293
If you don't pull this chair,

19:30.044 --> 19:32.922
not only will I kill your son,

19:33.005 --> 19:35.341
I'll kill everyone else here.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.509
Shit.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.439
Would you pull the chair or not?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.902
No right or wrong answers.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.530
Just say whatever comes to mind.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.909
Anne.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.000
I wouldn't pull the chair.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.293
Can you tell me why?

20:11.961 --> 20:15.297
Well, if I pull the chair,
my son will die for sure.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.343
But if I don't, there's always
a chance the guard is bluffing.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.803
I would pull the chair.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.886
Why?

20:22.596 --> 20:23.848
Because I don't care.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.767
It's my fault that my son tried to escape,

20:26.851 --> 20:30.604
so it wouldn't be fair
if everyone else died because of us.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.942
I mean, do I have another kid?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.279
I'd attack the guard.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.574
I'm not sure
if you understand the concept of firearms,

20:41.657 --> 20:43.701
but attacking the guard
is a losing battle.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.286
Losing battle like what?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.957
Like attacking a bear
with nothing but your hands.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.170
What makes you so sure
I would lose that fight?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.422
Thank you for sharing that with me, Anne.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.176
I think I have everything I need.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.927
I think I have everything I need.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.638
Thank you.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.724
You're welcome.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.892
Thank you.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.351
Oh, thank you.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.395
- I should go.
- Thank you.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.189
I will go.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.817
Unless you want me...
Unless you have more ques...

21:16.901 --> 21:18.486
Nope? All right.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.364
- Other door.
- Yup.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.448
Sorry.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.910
Still learning the lay of the land.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.382
Got any tea left?

22:23.509 --> 22:25.344
You just enter the house now.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.472
I can never resist a brew.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.266
There's some tea in the kitchen.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.727
Got to get back to work.

22:33.811 --> 22:34.812
Be my guest.

22:35.813 --> 22:39.692
Oh, yeah,
Daniel's got his head deep in pizza.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.193
It's his second one.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.739
Jeannine's been on the toilet now
for 25 minutes.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.325
She should've never had
the shoyu chicken, you know.

22:54.665 --> 22:55.666
You not gonna get that?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.586
Everyone else came on time.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.059
Please, come in.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.352
I'm kyo.

23:15.436 --> 23:16.770
Nice to meet you, kyo.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.981
This is the official entrance.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.817
Welcome.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.736
Please, sit.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.704
This is kyo. He'll be helping me tonight.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.165
Yes, we got introduced.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.708
Good. My name is will.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.543
- May I...
- Nice to meet you, will.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.633
May I call you Emma?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.348
Any problem?

23:52.932 --> 23:53.932
Actually...

23:56.352 --> 23:58.729
May I choose something for myself?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.691
It's just temporary.
If you're selected, you get another name.

24:02.775 --> 24:06.487
But if I'm not selected,
then it is the only one I'll ever have.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.783
Pick another name.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.451
Anything you want.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.998
I like Emma.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.879
Emma it is.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.132
Emma, may I take your picture?

24:28.592 --> 24:31.095
That won't be necessary.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.515
Sorry, it's a bit flashy.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.016
Thank you, kyo.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.810
Emma, do you know why you're here?

24:38.852 --> 24:42.648
All right, before we get started,
do you have any questions?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.149
Is kyo your boss?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.403
I've never thought of it that way, but no.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.780
I would not hire will.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.616
- So you're an interviewer too?
- He's not allowed to interview.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.700
Why?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.245
Unfortunately,

24:57.371 --> 24:58.747
I've never been alive.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.461
All right.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.505
I have a task for you.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.091
I'll start a story.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.801
You tell me how it ends.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.930
Just say whatever comes to mind.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.183
Your name is no longer Emma.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.144
You are a prisoner of war.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.188
- What kind of war?
- Just listen.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.943
You were sent to a concentration camp

25:29.111 --> 25:32.156
with your 11-year-old son, Nick.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.908
This morning, Nick tried to escape,

25:34.992 --> 25:38.328
but was caught by a sadistic guard
who wants to hang him.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.414
Nick is on this chair,

25:40.998 --> 25:43.417
with a cord around his neck.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.671
This small piece of furniture
is the only thing keeping your beloved son

25:47.755 --> 25:48.922
from being killed,

25:50.257 --> 25:52.551
when the guard says, "pull the chair."

25:54.595 --> 25:57.306
Pull the chair.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.396
If you don't pull that chair,

26:04.480 --> 26:07.107
not only will I kill your son,

26:07.191 --> 26:08.859
but all the other prisoners here.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.069
Do you want that?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.785
Will, will.

26:20.788 --> 26:21.789
Pull the chair.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.678
What would you do?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.265
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.349
Why not?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.895
Well, the way you put it,

26:44.978 --> 26:47.940
the guard is gonna kill my son
no matter what I do.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.275
- Correct?
- Correct.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.360
Why?

26:53.237 --> 26:54.822
Because he is a bad man.

26:54.905 --> 26:55.905
Why?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.242
Because that is the way it is.

26:58.325 --> 27:02.746
Because that's the way the story is,
or because that's the way the world is?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.545
Would you pull the chair or not?

27:11.588 --> 27:15.384
I'm really not sure if I can answer
your question if you don't answer mine.

27:20.097 --> 27:22.599
Interesting interviewing style
you got there.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.479
So, what'd you think of her?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.481
She didn't answer my questions.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.359
How bad is that?

27:32.442 --> 27:34.111
Everyone else answered them.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.405
Maybe she's more unique
than everyone else.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.366
Or maybe she's most likely
to fall on the battlefield.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.995
You always talk as if
you're sending them to war.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.415
You always talk as if
you've been alive to know anything.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.332
Excuse me?

27:47.416 --> 27:48.709
You're excused.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.714
Listen, will,
I'm not gonna argue with you again.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.383
Do whatever you want to yourself.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.261
Cut your dick off
with a plastic knife if you want.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.847
But for the selections, it's my duty

28:01.930 --> 28:04.057
to point out what I saw here, and that...

28:05.100 --> 28:06.268
That was unique.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.145
Thanks for the advice.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.354
Thanks for the tea.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.814
- Hello.
- Welcome back, Alex.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.523
Thank you.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.110
Hey, wonderful.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.905
Congratulations on making it
to the second day.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.242
Thank you. It's a nice surprise. Thanks.

29:03.325 --> 29:06.245
- Let me show you the house.
- Okay, I get the tour.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.580
- Lamp.
- Oh, lamp. Nice.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.165
Hot. Okay.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.584
This is the kitchen.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.254
Oh, wow, look at this.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.257
Very nice.
You like these two colors, don't you?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.802
Feel free to take anything you like.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.097
Careful what you say.
Careful what you say.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.556
Oh, look at these guys.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.601
Wanna show you the bathroom.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.145
Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, love that.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.316
This...

29:39.111 --> 29:40.529
Is the bathroom.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.363
Hot.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.907
Cold.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.245
May I turn it on?

29:48.328 --> 29:49.328
Sure.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.763
And this is where
you can see through the eyes

30:06.847 --> 30:09.224
of everyone I've previously selected.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.776
What should I do now?

30:19.860 --> 30:20.861
Just watch them.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.072
And anything you like, write it down.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.286
Can I write anything?

30:29.369 --> 30:30.912
Anything you like.

30:33.957 --> 30:34.958
Megan.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.294
Come here, sweetheart.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.093
What about this one?

30:46.553 --> 30:49.389
That's where you want
to be when this process is over.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.068
If you need anything,

31:02.736 --> 31:04.279
I'll be in this room here.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.365
Oh, will?

31:08.075 --> 31:11.244
Yesterday, you said,
I only have nine days.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.581
Did you start counting yesterday,
or did you start counting today?

31:14.664 --> 31:15.707
Yesterday.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.919
But try not to think too much about it.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.046
Oh, okay.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.434
Hey, Rick.

31:34.518 --> 31:35.727
- Come on, guys.
- Oh, man.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.980
Leave me alone.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.611
Come on, dude.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.554
No, it's not that cold.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.637
Oh, my god.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.307
That was good.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.937
Is everything okay here?

33:01.021 --> 33:02.898
Oh, yeah.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.108
What's that?

33:06.651 --> 33:07.736
Oh, it's nothing.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.530
Can I see?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.284
Oh, really, it's not anything.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.495
If it's not anything, let me see it.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.875
It's a work in progress.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.126
Mike.

33:26.296 --> 33:30.008
Okay, but it's not done.
I just started. It's nothing, just...

33:41.645 --> 33:42.979
It's beautiful, Mike.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.314
No, it's not.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.774
That is beautiful.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.610
Why would you want to hide this?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.529
Sorry, I don't know.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.447
Don't you like it?

33:53.740 --> 33:54.741
No, I hate it.

33:56.952 --> 33:57.952
I hate it.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.538
May I have it?

34:02.457 --> 34:03.792
You really want it?

34:10.882 --> 34:11.882
Okay.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.471
But can you not show anybody else?

34:17.681 --> 34:18.681
I won't.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.023
It's a beach.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.692
It certainly is.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.206
Amanda.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.543
- Amanda, what are you doing up there?
- Climbing.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.130
- Amanda, come down now, please.
- It's okay.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.716
Don't you dare think
about climbing any further.

34:56.594 --> 35:00.056
Okay, Amanda, come on.
One, two, three, go.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.019
All right.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.271
Sorry, Mr. Man.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.865
Are you finished?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.074
Not yet.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.037
You want some?

35:24.539 --> 35:25.957
Don't you get hungry?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.125
I'm like you.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.462
I don't get hungry, but I can eat.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.005
So why don't you eat?

35:32.088 --> 35:33.715
Because I don't get hungry.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.550
Is that really the point of eating?

35:37.385 --> 35:38.470
For me, it is.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.097
All right.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.479
Will?

35:49.773 --> 35:50.774
What's it like?

35:51.316 --> 35:52.316
What?

35:53.735 --> 35:54.735
To be alive.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.038
Maybe you'll find out.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.932
Oh, my god.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.814
Fernando.

38:39.526 --> 38:40.944
Is everything okay here?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.365
Why is he in a wheelchair?

38:46.866 --> 38:48.201
I read your papers.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.124
What'd you think?

38:55.208 --> 38:57.460
I think you can be more selective.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.714
You remember all of them?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.298
Pretty much.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.803
Do any of them ever remember you?

39:12.183 --> 39:14.894
Once. In childhood, one remembered me.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.897
But it didn't last very long.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.860
Why do you think that happened?

39:23.820 --> 39:25.071
I have no idea.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.252
What do you think?

39:39.335 --> 39:40.335
It's good.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.129
Very good.

39:44.299 --> 39:49.137
Is there anything you didn't like
that you want me to improve?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.014
It's better not to think that way.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.182
What way?

39:53.266 --> 39:55.143
I don't want you
to do what I think is right.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.853
I want you to do what's right for you.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.397
Right, but in the end,

39:59.480 --> 40:01.774
you still come and judge me, right?

40:04.152 --> 40:06.070
And how does that make you feel?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.365
How it makes me feel?

40:10.742 --> 40:11.743
Listen, will.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.788
I only have seven days left here, okay?

40:15.872 --> 40:19.000
So I'd appreciate
if you were just straightfon/vard with me.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.128
Just tell me the rules,
I'll play the game.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.676
I'm changing the assignment.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.930
Okay, to what?

40:32.013 --> 40:34.557
I want you
to pick something you don't like.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.518
A moment I don't like?

40:38.645 --> 40:40.021
Should I write that down too?

40:40.104 --> 40:43.066
You could take notes,
but we'll just talk about it.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.653
I'll work hard on this.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.619
Do you have any questions?

40:54.702 --> 40:58.498
Question? Yeah.
When are we gonna grab a beer together?

40:58.581 --> 40:59.415
A beer?

40:59.499 --> 41:01.876
I saw some bottles in the fridge.
You gotta have a grill.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.337
We can slap some steaks on,
call some chicks.

41:06.631 --> 41:10.009
I'm kind of busy these days,
but thanks for the invite.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.889
All right, well,
this was a great conversation.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.746
Hello?

41:41.457 --> 41:42.959
Oh, Mike.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.962
Can you come with me?

42:09.694 --> 42:11.487
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.907
You didn't do anything wrong.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.454
I knew I...

42:21.122 --> 42:22.290
I knew...

42:23.624 --> 42:24.751
That I wasn't good enough.

42:24.834 --> 42:30.214
This has nothing to do
with being good or bad.

42:36.763 --> 42:38.389
So this is the end of it.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.852
I guess we never really got started.

42:43.895 --> 42:44.979
Mike.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.320
It's not about the time that you spend.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.407
You've been here a few days,

42:56.949 --> 43:00.119
but you've lived every second

43:00.203 --> 43:02.997
with honesty and intensity.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.416
There's no shame in that.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.127
Now...

43:13.841 --> 43:16.761
I want you to think
of what you saw on those tvs,

43:17.303 --> 43:20.014
and pick a moment
truly meaningful for you.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.809
I know it's not much, but if you allow me,

43:22.892 --> 43:26.687
I will do my best to recreate
that moment for your experience.

43:31.734 --> 43:32.819
I'm sorry.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.446
Don't be sorry.

43:39.784 --> 43:40.827
You're good.

43:41.911 --> 43:42.911
Thank you.

43:54.465 --> 43:58.553
I was helping Joan a couple of weeks back,
and she had this candidate.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.556
This guy, I mean,
he was a right pain in the ass.

44:01.639 --> 44:05.309
Kept banging on like,
"where? How? Why?" All the time.

44:05.393 --> 44:09.188
And so Joan came up with
this really good argument like,

44:09.272 --> 44:12.733
"we don't know, just like
the people in the tvs who don't know."

44:12.817 --> 44:16.195
You know, and that,
to me, was mind-blowing.

44:16.279 --> 44:18.656
Maybe there's another parallel dimension

44:18.739 --> 44:20.950
where someone interviewed me,

44:21.033 --> 44:26.205
and she or he sent me here,
and I just can't remember.

44:26.289 --> 44:28.082
I mean, can you imagine it?

44:28.166 --> 44:30.626
Right now
there are people sat in their chairs,

44:30.710 --> 44:33.838
like, rooting for us, judging us,

44:34.380 --> 44:35.882
laughing at myjokes,

44:36.465 --> 44:40.303
and those people are being watched
by someone else too,

44:41.762 --> 44:43.431
who's being watched by someone else,

44:44.515 --> 44:46.767
who's being watched by someone else,

44:46.851 --> 44:48.978
who's being watched by someone else.

44:51.230 --> 44:52.732
It's deep, though, innit?

45:01.782 --> 45:03.034
Tag. You're it.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.536
You're it now.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.683
Do you need something?

45:27.767 --> 45:28.767
What is this?

45:29.310 --> 45:30.645
It's a last wish.

45:31.646 --> 45:32.647
I don't get it.

45:33.189 --> 45:34.857
A candidate was eliminated, so...

45:34.941 --> 45:38.319
I asked if there was a moment
he would like to experience.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.196
A last wish.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.240
We're making a moment here.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.617
I can't picture a moment here.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.119
Neither can I. Just following orders.

45:47.203 --> 45:48.663
Let me help.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.332
You won't get any extra time
for your assignment.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.709
- I already finished for today.
- You can sand the wood.

45:53.793 --> 45:56.170
I don't have time
to teach her how to sand.

45:56.254 --> 45:57.463
I can figure it out.

46:01.634 --> 46:03.552
Looks like we got a natural here.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.350
Kyo?

46:11.769 --> 46:13.729
If you could pick a moment,

46:13.813 --> 46:15.439
what moment would you pick?

46:15.523 --> 46:16.523
A moment?

46:17.233 --> 46:19.235
A moment you'd like to experience.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.488
Okay, don't laugh.

46:23.155 --> 46:23.990
I won't.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.073
Well,

46:25.700 --> 46:27.118
in the movies,

46:27.660 --> 46:30.037
when they climb the top of the mountain,

46:30.121 --> 46:34.417
they usually yell something out,
so they can hear their voice echoing.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.334
Okay.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.962
I would take a deep breath, and...

46:50.057 --> 46:51.726
You're laughing, Emma.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.561
I'm laughing with you.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.438
You're... oh, laughing with me.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.191
What about you, will?

47:00.693 --> 47:02.069
I've lived before.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.780
I know.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.742
Is there a moment you'd like to...?

47:07.825 --> 47:09.452
There is no moment.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.746
Not a single one?

47:11.829 --> 47:13.289
From your whole life?

47:13.372 --> 47:14.582
Enough.

47:15.916 --> 47:16.959
Why do you say that?

47:18.127 --> 47:19.754
You're the one who's lived. Why say...?

47:19.837 --> 47:20.837
Enough.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.301
Kyo, can you please
help me take this inside?

47:29.847 --> 47:33.851
Does every interviewer do that
for the candidates who get eliminated?

47:33.934 --> 47:35.770
No, only him.

47:37.021 --> 47:38.272
What happened to him?

47:39.565 --> 47:40.775
When he was alive?

47:46.781 --> 47:47.781
Will was...

47:48.824 --> 47:49.824
Special.

47:50.659 --> 47:51.660
Special how?

47:53.412 --> 47:54.412
Too good.

47:55.581 --> 47:56.581
Too kind.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.709
Too sensitive.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.254
But isn't that a good thing?

48:04.548 --> 48:07.802
When I first saw will,
he was still in one of those tvs.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.681
Talented, but struggled his whole life

48:12.765 --> 48:15.101
to fit into a world different from him.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.520
Did have love inside him.

48:18.938 --> 48:19.980
Maybe too much.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.734
Too much love, no one to give it to.

48:27.363 --> 48:28.363
You know,

48:29.657 --> 48:31.534
we can't do a lot from here,
we really can't,

48:31.617 --> 48:34.703
but there were days
I wished I was with him,

48:36.288 --> 48:39.667
just to let him know
he wasn't alone as he thought he was.

49:48.694 --> 49:49.945
It's match point.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.114
Everything in his favor.

49:52.198 --> 49:55.034
One-love, 40-15, his serve.

49:56.410 --> 49:57.411
He hits the ball.

49:57.995 --> 49:58.829
Net.

49:58.913 --> 50:01.332
So he tries again, but more nervous now.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.043
I think,

50:04.835 --> 50:08.172
"he's done it a thousand times.
He'll be all right."

50:09.381 --> 50:10.382
Net.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.092
- Net.
- Oh, come on.

50:12.176 --> 50:13.427
It's all downhill from there.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.013
- So close to winning, but...
- Damn it.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.684
He let his emotions get in the way.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.145
So in that situation, you would do what?

50:25.856 --> 50:27.107
I'd fight through it.

50:29.151 --> 50:32.154
She takes the box,
puts the doughnuts in, and passes it on.

50:32.238 --> 50:35.366
She takes the box,
puts the doughnuts in, and passes it on.

50:35.449 --> 50:38.661
She takes the box,
puts the doughnuts in, and passes it on.

50:38.744 --> 50:41.997
She takes the box,
puts the doughnuts in, and passes it on.

50:43.624 --> 50:47.127
Did I tell you, she takes the box,
puts the doughnuts in, and passes it on?

50:50.089 --> 50:52.007
I've been watching this one kid,

50:52.550 --> 50:54.301
Rick, for the past few days.

50:55.594 --> 50:56.804
How's it going, man?

50:57.721 --> 50:59.890
And every time I see him,

50:59.974 --> 51:02.268
his classmates are picking on him.

51:02.351 --> 51:04.186
Hurting him, stealing from him.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.730
- We're not pressing that hard. Come on.
- Rick.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.358
I don't like what the kids do to Rick,

51:09.900 --> 51:11.569
but what I really don't like

51:12.111 --> 51:13.445
is what he doesn't do.

51:14.488 --> 51:18.534
He never reacts.
He never does anything. He just takes it.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.079
What would you do in his position?

51:23.247 --> 51:24.498
I would hit back.

51:25.165 --> 51:27.084
So you're justifying violence.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.461
Well, it's not...

51:30.129 --> 51:32.548
It's not violence if you didn't start it.

51:32.631 --> 51:33.632
Then what is it?

51:36.885 --> 51:37.885
Jusfice.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.139
It's the only way...

51:40.222 --> 51:42.308
It's the only way you'd get them to stop.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.317
I did what you asked me.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.111
And I observed several people.

51:54.194 --> 51:57.615
And I chose one that
I have been watching very closely.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.826
And what don't you like about this person?

52:04.538 --> 52:05.831
He hates himself.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.669
He thinks he's a failure,

52:11.253 --> 52:15.174
and that everything he does
is worthless and shameful.

52:15.257 --> 52:19.303
And no doubt that
he's experienced so much pain

52:19.386 --> 52:23.849
to a point where he felt so much
that today he just wants to feel nothing.

52:25.726 --> 52:30.105
And the numbness,
it makes him feel safe now.

52:31.065 --> 52:32.232
But I know that...

52:33.734 --> 52:36.779
It's really just poisoning
what is left of him.

52:39.156 --> 52:44.536
And deep inside, I think he knows it too.

52:47.790 --> 52:48.791
This man...

52:50.876 --> 52:52.503
He sounds irreparable.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.214
He thinks so.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.927
But I know that
there's still something left.

53:03.055 --> 53:04.223
Will.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.558
Sorry to interrupt, but Mike's here.

53:07.393 --> 53:10.604
Feel free to spend
the rest of your day in the TV room.

53:31.667 --> 53:33.794
Oh, all right. Come in.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.438
Stay here, and no matter what happens,

53:52.521 --> 53:54.022
don't let him see you.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.111
Thank you for your help.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.367
The candidate really enjoyed the moment.

57:36.662 --> 57:37.913
Glad to hear that.

58:00.978 --> 58:05.816
The man that
you were talking about this afternoon...

58:12.406 --> 58:17.452
In high school,
he was a part of this theater group.

58:17.536 --> 58:19.538
He never liked it.
No one liked him either.

58:23.625 --> 58:24.668
Nevertheless...

58:28.338 --> 58:30.716
Two days before the opening night,

58:30.799 --> 58:33.844
the main actor, Sam,

58:34.553 --> 58:35.887
got really sick.

58:36.930 --> 58:39.016
He wasn't the best
to replace Sam, for sure,

58:39.099 --> 58:41.476
but he had the best memory in the group,

58:41.560 --> 58:45.897
and Sam's monologues were quite long
to be memorized in such a short time.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.401
So for the next 48 hours,

58:49.484 --> 58:53.530
this poor kid read
and reread that monologue,

58:53.613 --> 58:56.992
hundreds upon hundreds
upon hundreds of times,

58:57.075 --> 58:59.786
right up until the minute
before the curtains opened.

59:01.455 --> 59:02.831
Hands sweating,

59:03.999 --> 59:04.999
shaking.

59:06.918 --> 59:10.464
But when he stepped on that stage,
something weird happened.

59:13.675 --> 59:16.762
This warm feeling came to him,
as if he was...

59:19.306 --> 59:20.932
No longer invisible.

59:22.976 --> 59:28.190
He was all over the stage,
becoming one with all those watching,

59:28.273 --> 59:31.068
and the words vibrating everywhere,

59:31.151 --> 59:33.487
yet no longer coming from him,
but through him,

59:33.570 --> 59:35.947
as if his body was nothing but a vessel.

59:37.741 --> 59:41.119
He can't explain it even looking back now.

59:47.542 --> 59:50.504
A glimpse of something
he'd never touched before...

59:56.593 --> 59:58.261
And would never touch again.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.767
That's the moment
he would like to experience again?

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:06.685
Not at all.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.147
Why?

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.108
Because...

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:15.320
It would make him feel alive again.

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:29.793
I'm telling you this
because I think you've got talent.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.631
But if you really want to survive that,

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.801
you're going to need to become tougher.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.933
Tougher than this man ever was.

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:54.818
And how do I know

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.737
the man is telling the truth,

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:02.075
now that I find out
he was once a great actor?

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:57.631
Then I searched through her adult life,
and I couldn't find anything either.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:01.092
There were bad moments,
but she always handled them really well.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:05.222
Now look at this.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.183
She got the violin to the car.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.227
If she wasn't driving
to the concerto that day,

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.312
why would she take the violin with her?

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.065
One thing stood out to me, though.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.403
You probably remember
that she rarely cried.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:21.863
No tears, nothing.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.240
She never let it out.

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.033
The only time she did that...

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.168
Was when she played the violin.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.798
It makes me wonder
if there was a part of her

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.508
that she was always hiding,

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.594
like something that she never showed,

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.972
that we never saw, because...

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.307
Why are you doing this, will?

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:57.774
- Just trying to figure out what happened.
- We can't figure out what happened there.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.403
I need to know.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.570
Why?

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:09.077
Because it's my duty to know for a fact.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.913
Your duty is to choose someone,

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:15.500
and mine is to make sure
you chose well, in my opinion.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.878
And in my opinion,

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.256
she was the best choice.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.593
No matter if she did it on purpose or not.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.804
You feel the same?

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:40.858
Will.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.075
See you tomorrow.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.218
Come on, let me go.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.596
Let me go.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.056
What would you do?

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.390
Come on.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:14.309
I would talk to them.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.269
Let me go. Come on, guys.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.854
That's not going to work.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:18.937
Come on.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:22.525
I would talk to them again.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:29.366
You find a wallet in the street
with 500 dollars in it.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.450
What do you do?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:34.287
I'd take the money,
but I'd donate half of it to charity.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.583
Why do you donate half of it to charity?

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:41.419
So you don't ask me why I took the money.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.300
Your mother makes cookies
for your brother, but not for you.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:49.886
What do you do?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:55.767
There's gonna be a delicious spit glaze
on them, I'll tell you that much.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.562
My god. That's about to bite.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.524
Hey.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.485
That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:19.249
Look what I found in the fridge.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.042
Hey, all right.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.003
Okay.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.215
Hey.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.511
To our six-day friendship.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:41.312
Only three more to go.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:49.779
That's nice.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.120
You learn you have six months to live.
What do you do?

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.204
I travel the world.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.289
What do you do?

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:02.000
I empty our bank accounts,
and call a divorce attorney.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.878
- What do you do?
- I get a ride with one of my coworkers.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.254
What do you do?

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:07.464
I poison him.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.511
Here are the rest of the tests.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:15.679
Thank you.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.270
Will.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:26.858
Yes, Maria.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.410
Oh, I think I forgot.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.126
Well, if you remember,
I'll be in the other room.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:46.793
Thank you.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.273
I left my assignment on the desk.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:08.983
Thank you, Maria.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:15.800
Hi, will. This is Colleen.
Colleen, this is will.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.678
Nice to meet you, will.
Kyo talked a lot about you.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.680
Wish I could say the same.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.848
Can we come in?

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.930
Who is she?

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.268
Colleen's an interviewer too.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.270
A great one, just like you.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.314
So you just bring all the other
interviewers to my house now?

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:35.569
Well, by coincidence, she chose someone
who knew someone you chose.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.363
As in, they knew each other
in the real world?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.533
Small real world, isn't it?

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.662
Who did you choose?

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:46.288
Cecily.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.666
Amanda's cousin.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:52.587
You know, they were so close at that time.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.798
I always remember Amanda and cecily

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.426
watching that
cartoon together after school.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:01.011
The one with that purple talking horse.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.930
What was the name of that show?
"Fire" something.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.015
The wildfire.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.895
Yes, the wildfire.
Cecily was crazy about that one.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.856
She had like five shoe boxes filled
with all the toys.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:16.569
You know, the horses,
the girl, the king, the queen.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.154
Except"

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.488
lady diabolyn.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.658
Only Amanda had that one.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.118
Only Amanda.

01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.870
Forget how she got it.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:28.747
She played for
one of the composers of the show.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:29.831
That kid.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:33.169
You must be very proud of her.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:37.799
You know, like you,
I've been alive, too, and it's...

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.884
Let's not talk about me, shall we?

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.617
They found this after Amanda died.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.399
I didn't see her write it.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:39.986
Sometimes it's hard
to keep track of all of them.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.738
You can't record everything.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.321
Just go.

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:45.450
Please, just...

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.743
Just go.

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:50.788
I'm sorry it's hard to hear.
I just want you to move on.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:53.624
Just give him some time.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:56.085
You know how hard it is
for me to watch you do...

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.378
Get out.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.731
She didn't do this.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.566
She didn't do this.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.527
She didn't do this.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.687
No, no, no.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.814
No, no, no.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.400
Diego. Diego.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.161
Is this Fernando?

01:12:56.998 --> 01:13:00.543
If you were this person
in that situation, what would you do?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:04.421
Emma?

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:08.217
I need you to answer.

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:11.929
I don't know the answer.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.139
How could you know?

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:20.021
- If I could be there in that situation...
- That's not possible.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.398
Yes, I know,
but that's why I can't give you an answer.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.400
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:26.735
What would you do?

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:28.738
I don't know.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:39.665
Are you okay?

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.737
What would you do?

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.074
I wouldn't think twice.
The moment he moved, he'd be dead.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:31.592
What would you do?

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.302
I don't know.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:35.888
I don't know.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.099
I can't even understand
what they're saying.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:41.852
- You think it's funny?
- No, it's just a joke. It's just a joke.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.938
- It's a joke for you?
- No, it...

01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:46.649
Come on, this is heavy shit,

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:47.733
heavy shit,

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.403
and I don't understand
why we can't just relax.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.155
This is so tense.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.492
Thank you.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:01.163
Come on.

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:04.083
If you were in this situation,
what would you do?

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.585
I don't understand why this is necessary.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.379
This is pain.

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:13.843
What you're feeling right now is nothing
compared to what people feel when alive.

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:14.926
Stop.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:32.861
Is this...

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.160
Is this because of what I wrote to you?

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.163
It isn't.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.877
I knew
I shouldn't have written that letter.

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.630
But something inside me...

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:55.760
I couldn't stop it.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:15:59.472
So I thought that...

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.643
Maybe it meant something.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.730
That maybe you felt

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.357
the same way.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:13.069
I'm sorry if you misunderstood, Maria.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.246
I would like for you
to write down a moment truly meaningful...

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.664
I had a chance.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.004
I had a chance, but I threw it away.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.878
Are you not gonna get dressed?

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.462
I'm fine.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.090
Okay.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.895
Congratulations, will.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.773
She looks happy.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.406
I have to get back to work.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:43.719
Sorry to keep you waiting, Alex.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:44.802
It's all right.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:49.225
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:52.478
Come on, will, it was my fault too.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.189
I should've taken your question
a little more seriously.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.566
I also wanted to thank you

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.945
for everything that
you've been doing here.

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.325
That's nice to hear.
I've had... it's my pleasure.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:07.867
My pleasure.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.373
But I have to tell you that...

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:14.124
What do you have to tell me?

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.838
I have to tell you that you
don't fit the vacancy you're applying for.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.054
And that means?

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:28.764
I'm not choosing you, Alex.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:35.062
But thank you for all your hard work
and dedication over the past eight days.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.814
You've come very far.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.860
Please, I'm just...
If you could just give me one more chance.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:45.781
I just want one more chance.
That's it. That's all I need.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:49.618
- There's nothing I can do.
- Just one more chance.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.705
I know you were pissed yesterday,

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:55.833
and I'm telling you,
I promise that won't happen again.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.544
- That's not it.
- That's what I'm telling you.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:19:59.627
That's not it.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.547
Then what is it?

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.715
What is it?

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.050
I'm asking for another chance.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.177
You can't do that for a friend?

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.804
I thought we were friends.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:12.308
Since I'm not choosing you...

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:21.317
I would like for you to write down
a moment truly meaningful for you.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.320
- I'll do my best to recreate that moment.
- Please.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.864
Please, will. Please.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.742
I made my decision.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:31.326
I'm sorry.

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:41.712
God, you're pathetic.

01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:49.386
You stay in this house,
and you judge everyone,

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.722
and everything,

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.474
but what have you done, huh?

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:57.144
What have you done?
Who the fuck are you to judge us?

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:05.069
You're afraid.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:08.489
You're afraid.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.702
And you want everybody else
to be afraid too.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:14.995
That's it, isn't it?

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:17.663
Not me.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.960
I'm notjumping on that train, man.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.517
Thank you for coming.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:23.100
Will.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.184
It's okay.

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:27.395
Please.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:30.274
Please, please.

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:33.151
- Don't let me go. Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:36.697
- Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.491
- Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:42.744
- I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
- It's okay.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.371
I don't want to go.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:54.566
I thought I told you
to dismiss her for today.

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:57.486
I'm sorry. I forgot.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:02.866
She doesn't fit.

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:05.285
Why do you keep her in the house, then?

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:08.245
All right.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.957
I'll eliminate her tonight.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.876
What? Why?

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.212
She didn't show me
what I needed to see from her.

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.006
Let me guess. You want her to be tough?
Maybe kill someone?

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.676
You want me
to pick another prey like I did before.

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:21.759
A prey?

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:25.389
Prey? What the fuck are you talking about?

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:29.017
Last week Amanda was your pride and joy.
Now she's a failure?

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.310
She's not a failure.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.605
You wouldn't understand, because you're...

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:35.565
- Because I've never been alive?
- Yes.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:38.402
- That what you're gonna say?
- Yes, that's what I was going to say.

01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:43.031
You know, what I hate most about you is
that look in your eyes

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:47.369
as if you think you knew everything when
you just shat on the opportunity you had.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:48.745
"Opportunity."

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.751
I hope you have it.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:27:00.674
- So you can stop this nonsense jealousy.
- I'm not jealous.

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:02.092
You can't even see it.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:05.178
It's not about me or you.
It's about giving her a chance.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:06.804
Great.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.766
That's a great idea.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:14.020
I send flowers,
and other people send pigs to eat them.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.110
It's Rick.

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:25.615
Fuck you, man.

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:27.451
What happened?

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:30.954
He reacted.

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:33.039
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Fuck.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:35.500
You're gonna hit me, and then run?

01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.175
What are you thinking?

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.268
All right.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.440
Why do you think she did it?

01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:27.070
She's dead, will. Why's it matter?

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:29.281
Twenty-eight years watching her,

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.616
and I couldn't see a warning sign.

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:37.831
Even if you saw all the signs,
what could you do from here?

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:38.957
Nothing.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.458
I couldn't do anything.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:44.963
All I can do is send them
to that shithole, and say, "survive it."

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.799
- It's a shithole?
- It's a shithole.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.092
- Hole full of shit.
- Yeah.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:50.302
I get the metaphor.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.887
Because you're smart.

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.805
Very smart, kyo, and I'm dumb.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:56.933
Very, very dumb.
Couldn't even see it when I chose her.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:08.194
That she's just like me.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:14.409
You had great potential, will.
You know that.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:15.744
Potential for what?

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:17.329
To fail?

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:18.580
To give up?

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.293
What about the good memories?

01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:28.173
Good memories, bad memories,
they're all just the same right now.

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:32.135
It still hurts...

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:37.891
In a way that
no one can see, and only I can feel.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:41.519
And now...

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:44.897
Now what?

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:49.986
Now I know she felt the same way.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:09.232
- Welcome, madame.
- Hi. Good evening.

01:32:09.315 --> 01:32:12.444
- Like to come this way?
- Well, the place looks lovely.

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:14.696
Yeah, we just had it done.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.363
- Kane?
- Yeah.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:17.406
This is Emma.

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.162
Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.039
Pleasure's all mine.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:26.166
I have to go back now.
Please, take a seat.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:28.960
- A delicious dinner will be served.
- Thank you.

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:45.851
Last day.

01:32:51.107 --> 01:32:52.107
Are you afraid?

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:54.943
Of what?

01:32:57.739 --> 01:32:59.574
What might happen.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:05.996
Are you?

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:12.837
I think so.

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:17.717
I saw this a few years ago, and it just...

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.886
It just gives me the shivers.

01:33:19.969 --> 01:33:22.972
I'm watching this girl as
she's driving back home,

01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:24.349
pissed out of her head,

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:27.185
and her mate's in the back,
completely wasted.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:31.106
Then, boom, car passes over the bump.

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:33.650
Her mate wakes up, desperate to puke.

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:37.695
Electric windows are broken.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:40.490
"Stop the car. Stop the car."

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:42.617
And mate just keeps driving.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:43.827
What does he do?

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:46.704
He pukes, but in his mouth.

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:50.708
He's trying to keep her mom's car clean,

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:53.878
so he heroically swallows everything back.

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:58.174
And the taste is so fucking bad.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.552
And as this puke is going down,

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.304
it just starts coming back up again.

01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:05.014
And now he's swallowing it.

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.225
- Puking, swallowing it.
- No.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:10.395
She's driving to get back home.
He opens the door.

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:24.659
It's your go, champ.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.077
What?

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:28.997
A story more disgusting than mine.

01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:33.793
I don't have a story like that.

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:40.299
All right.

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.761
It's not a puke story, but...

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:47.223
A few days ago, I was watching the news

01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:49.893
of two middle-school girls
who went missing.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.645
Everybody started looking for them.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.522
Initially their parents
were really hopeful

01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:57.775
that it was just a prank
or something, right?

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:00.403
Well, two days later,

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:02.864
the authorities found out
that they were dead.

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:04.949
Turned out that

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:09.913
their 60-year-old English schoolteacher
raped and murdered those girls,

01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:11.831
and then buried them in his backyard.

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:15.585
Now,
when the police asked him why he did it,

01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:17.753
he said,

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.341
because he was in love with them.

01:35:25.887 --> 01:35:27.555
That was fucking disgusting.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:31.851
I don't think that was the type
of disgusting he was referring to.

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:35.688
No, but it's what I find disgusting.

01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:39.191
Okay.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.738
I'm just curious why you decided
to bring up this isolated case...

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:47.700
Isolated case? What do you mean?
Stuff like that happens all the time.

01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:49.285
- All the time?
- Yeah.

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:51.805
I feel like you're bringing up
an exception.

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:55.208
An exception? Are you kidding me?
What world have you been watching?

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:57.085
The same world you've been watching.

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:58.294
I don't think you have.

01:35:58.378 --> 01:36:01.631
Every single day,
someone hurts someone else.

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:04.425
Every single day,
someone takes someone else's life.

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.386
Every single day,
someone takes their own life.

01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:07.720
Why are you focusing on that?

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:09.764
Why are you not focusing on that?

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:13.685
Emma, why don't you tell us
your disgusting story?

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:15.269
Okay.

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:21.526
Two days ago, I was watching a young woman

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:24.112
who happened
to have a big poop clogging her toilet.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.863
I like the premise. Go on.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:28.783
So she kept trying to flush it,

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:30.576
but it would just stay there.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.371
Until she brought a guy to her apartment.

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:36.374
And, of course, the first thing
he wanted to do was use her bathroom.

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:39.836
So she freaked out.
She was like, "just give me a minute."

01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:43.047
She ran in there, locked the door.
She opens a new toothbrush.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:50.138
And then she begins
to rub that gigantic mass of poop.

01:36:51.014 --> 01:36:55.768
And she rubs it, and rubs it, and rubs it,

01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:58.479
until the bowl is sparkling clean.

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:03.026
Later on, they were spooning,
and he whispers in her ear,

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:07.363
"babe, thank you so much
for leaving me that toothbrush.

01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:10.074
I really love the soft ones."

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:11.701
Oh, god.

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:13.369
Is that it?

01:37:13.453 --> 01:37:17.206
No, because five minutes
before he told her that,

01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:18.791
they were passionately making out.

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.974
Now that you've had the chance
to get to know each other,

01:38:17.517 --> 01:38:19.936
possibly see some things maybe I haven't,

01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:22.355
I have a simple request.

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:26.776
I would like for you to tell me
why the person sitting next to you

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.445
doesn't deserve to be alive.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:42.708
Who wants to start?

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:12.572
I have to tell you that you don't fit
the position you're applying for.

01:39:14.907 --> 01:39:17.952
I know it's not easy
to receive this kind of news,

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:22.415
but I would like for you
to take advantage of the remaining hours

01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:26.002
to write down
a moment truly meaningful for you.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.008
It's not much.

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:36.012
But if you allow me, I will do my best

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:39.182
to recreate
that moment for your experience.

01:39:47.023 --> 01:39:48.483
You can take your time.

01:39:57.783 --> 01:39:59.494
You have to choose something else.

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:02.371
But I can't think of anything else.

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:10.795
I'm sorry.

01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:22.934
Some hours after you leave the house,

01:40:23.476 --> 01:40:26.562
you'll feel it,
as if you weren't here anymore,

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:29.565
and your senses were
becoming unbearably sharper,

01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:32.610
and stronger.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.613
It's your new beginning.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:40.117
You'll never remember me,

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:42.912
or anything else
that happened in this place,

01:40:42.995 --> 01:40:47.250
but as I said before, you'll still be you.

01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:55.466
Thank you.

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:59.303
There's nothing to thank me for.

01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:07.228
I'm really sorry about Emma.

01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:20.658
Emma's here to say goodbye.

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:35.548
He's busy with some other work.

01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:37.425
I understand.

01:41:38.718 --> 01:41:42.471
You've still got some time left.
Do you want me to wait with you?

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:44.140
No, no, thank you.

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:49.478
I think I would rather be alone.

01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:52.022
Okay.

01:41:54.275 --> 01:41:55.985
You know, we've come a long way.

01:41:56.527 --> 01:41:57.778
Nine days.

01:41:59.572 --> 01:42:00.572
Nine days.

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:08.371
Emma.

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.292
It's been a pleasure.

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:22.762
The pleasure's been mine.

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:48.953
She's gone.

01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.073
Will...

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:29.245
Probably by the time you read this,
I'll no longer exist.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:33.582
I'm sorry that life
didn't go the way you wanted,

01:43:33.666 --> 01:43:35.918
and that all the pain you went through

01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:39.630
doesn't allow you
to see what I can see right now.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:42.758
I took the freedom
to write all the beautiful moments

01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:44.802
that I experienced in this house.

01:43:45.845 --> 01:43:49.932
Look attentively,
and you will always find these moments.

01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:53.185
Please, don't take them for granted,

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:57.022
because in my nine days here, I never did.

01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.190
Emma.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:57.393
Emma!

01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:02.166
Have you ever reckon 'd the earth much?

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:08.130
Spend this day

01:47:09.381 --> 01:47:10.716
and night with me

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:14.094
and you shall possess the origin

01:47:14.803 --> 01:47:16.096
of all poems

01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:21.310
I celebrate myself

01:47:22.311 --> 01:47:23.896
and sing myself

01:47:26.315 --> 01:47:28.817
and what I assume you shall assume

01:47:28.901 --> 01:47:33.530
for every atom belonging to me

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:36.158
as good belongs to you

01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:38.202
lloafe and invite my soul

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:43.040
I lean and I loafe at my ease

01:47:43.707 --> 01:47:46.377
observing a spear

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:49.713
of summer grass

01:47:52.633 --> 01:47:53.676
my tongue

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:59.181
every atom of my blood

01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:01.600
born here

01:48:03.102 --> 01:48:05.020
from parents born here

01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:07.856
and their parents the same

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.441
as their parents the same

01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:12.987
I, now 37 years old
and in perfect health begin

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:15.197
hoping to cease not till death

01:48:19.868 --> 01:48:21.954
the smoke of my breath echoes

01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:24.039
ripples

01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:27.793
buzz'd whispers

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.336
love-root

01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:32.047
silk-thread

01:48:33.048 --> 01:48:35.843
crotch and vine

01:48:37.136 --> 01:48:41.557
my inspiration and respiration

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.561
the passing of air and blood

01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:47.855
through my lungs

01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:50.399
the sound of the belch 'd words of my voice

01:48:59.992 --> 01:49:01.952
Loos'd to the Eddies of the wind

01:49:03.829 --> 01:49:05.539
a few light kisses

01:49:08.667 --> 01:49:10.294
a few embraces

01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:13.547
the reaching around of arms

01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:19.344
the play of the light

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:21.597
and shade on the trees

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.557
as the supple boughs wag

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:26.477
the delight alone

01:49:28.145 --> 01:49:29.772
or the rush of the streets

01:49:30.898 --> 01:49:33.901
or along the fields and hill-sides

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:36.737
the feeling of health

01:49:45.704 --> 01:49:47.623
The full-noon trill

01:49:49.875 --> 01:49:52.086
the song of me

01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:57.800
rising from bed and greeting the sun

01:49:57.883 --> 01:49:58.883
hey, sun

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:03.764
sun, sun, sun

01:50:03.847 --> 01:50:05.557
sun, sun, sun

01:50:05.641 --> 01:50:06.892
sun, sun

01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:10.521
the last scud of sun holds back for me

01:50:11.063 --> 01:50:13.649
it flings my likeness after the rest

01:50:13.732 --> 01:50:19.488
and as true as any on the shadow'd wilds
it coaxes me to the vapor

01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:20.864
and the dusk

01:50:23.367 --> 01:50:25.077
I depart as air

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:30.249
I effuse my flesh in Eddies

01:50:30.833 --> 01:50:33.752
and drift it in Lacy jags

01:50:34.711 --> 01:50:36.046
and to die

01:50:37.714 --> 01:50:38.882
ls different

01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:42.427
than any one supposed
and luckier

01:50:42.511 --> 01:50:44.721
I bequeath myself to the dirt

01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:47.850
to grow from the grass I love

01:50:47.933 --> 01:50:49.685
if you want me again

01:50:50.269 --> 01:50:52.479
look for me under your boot-soles

01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:56.942
you will hardly know who I am
or what I mean

01:50:57.025 --> 01:51:00.154
but I shall be good health
to you nevertheless

01:51:00.237 --> 01:51:03.365
failing to fetch me at first

01:51:03.448 --> 01:51:04.908
keep encouraged

01:51:05.868 --> 01:51:07.494
missing me one place

01:51:09.037 --> 01:51:10.330
search another

01:51:16.461 --> 01:51:18.255
I stop some place

01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:20.924
waiting for you

01:51:49.661 --> 01:51:50.661
Thank you.
