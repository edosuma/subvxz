WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:11.965
Previously on "Power"...

00:12.120 --> 00:13.929
When we met,
what'd you think I was gonna be?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.128
The biggest goddamn drug
dealer in New York City.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.250
I don't know any old,
wrinkled drug dealers.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.890
They're either dead or inside.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.448
Since when do you lie to me?
Since when do you hide shit?

00:24.600 --> 00:26.011
Ghost took back his loyalty,

00:26.160 --> 00:27.924
so now it's time
for you to do the same.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.844
I want to change my life for you.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.082
I don't want
to break up your marriage.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.730
You like having me around, huh?

00:33.880 --> 00:35.609
- I do.
- I want your offer.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.485
- $6 million to own it outright.
- Truth is not for sale.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.524
The moment I detect disloyalty,
I cut it out.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.681
You was right about Rolla.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.207
- I'm sorry it turned out like this, G.
- It was Kanan, right?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.010
You were still tight
after all these years.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.288
I am your friend.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.811
Rolla's dead.
You owe me money.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.325
And you owe me bodies.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.005
You make sure my son
ain't there when you do it, neither.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.322
I want Ghost dead
before I get out.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.244
I'm your friend.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.771
I guess we should get to it.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.809
I am your friend.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.280
They say we supposed
to get 10 inches.

02:51.400 --> 02:59.400
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:08.000 --> 03:09.764
I'm your friend.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.089
Glass was empty.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.289
The coroner found whiskey
in Rolla's stomach.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.091
So whoever killed him
gave him a last drink.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.921
That's classy.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.850
So I hear you turned down
the new border task force in Detroit.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.125
- Guess you'll be sticking around?
- Rolla's murder is a new lead.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.041
Sure, but we have
no money to follow it.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.810
With Lobos
being prosecuted in California,

04:23.960 --> 04:25.246
they've shut us down.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.847
Now Rolla's death
is officially an NYPD case,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.365
just like Anibal.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.931
Might be the same hitter.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.691
I don't think so.
He had a drink.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.684
At the kill shot, he fell right out
of his chair onto the floor.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.201
No defensive wounds,
no sign of struggle.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.046
- You think it was someone he knew.
- And he didn't see it coming.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.441
He trusted the person.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.170
You think it was the distributor?

04:50.320 --> 04:51.606
You think it was Ghost?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.882
You could be right.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.407
But it doesn't matter.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.040
Cali will have Lobos indicted
by the end of the week.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.848
It's time to let it go, cowgirl.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.405
We'll get the next one.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.801
I'm gonna get some water.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.406
Mm, no!

05:18.560 --> 05:20.528
Bed gets cold when you leave.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.331
It always does.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.290
I like it when you're like this.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.682
You kind of scared me
the other night.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.569
Ghost did that thing we talked about,
so I'm all good now.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.643
Who's Ghost?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.088
James.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.929
Ghost is a...

05:52.720 --> 05:54.609
nickname, like...

05:56.080 --> 05:57.844
just between me and him.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.211
Why "Ghost"?

06:03.800 --> 06:07.805
We knew this guy "Breeze"
when we were kids.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.009
He came up with Ghost.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.209
He said the kid
had the ability to disappear.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.291
Never saw him coming,
you never saw him leave.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.570
Those expensive-ass shoes
he wears now changed all that,

06:24.720 --> 06:26.688
clickety fucking clack.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.282
I heard him the other night.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.124
He was here, right?

06:34.280 --> 06:35.611
I didn't know you were awake.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.489
Holly, you shoulda said something.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.041
Tommy, it's okay.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.406
You can trust me.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.210
I told you.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.409
Ghost has Tasha in his corner.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.847
She knows everything, right?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.490
And she's got his back.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.170
Yeah.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.844
Maybe I can be like that.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.249
Someone in your corner,
just for you.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.889
- Jamie.
- Angie, how you doing?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.202
I'll be better when I see you.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.964
Yeah, I wish you were
here with me right now.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.731
You know,

07:15.880 --> 07:18.565
I'm free the night
of your Sutton Place party.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.081
Uh, Tasha's known about it
for weeks now.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.526
I told her she could come.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.128
Yeah, of course.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.203
Look, Angie, baby,
I promise, all right?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.488
I'm gonna change my life.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.364
It's gonna be my club,
my kids, and you.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.240
Could I see you today?

07:42.240 --> 07:43.810
I've got Raina's play.
She's Annie.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.290
Be with your family.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.250
- Angie.
- I got to go.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.969
- Hello.
- Thanks again.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.724
- Hi, Mrs. St. Patrick.
- Thank you so much.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.206
- It was great.
- Mom, Mom!

09:34.360 --> 09:35.361
Congratulations.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.285
- Hey, how are you?
- Great, I appreciate it.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.124
Oh, my goodness.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.561
- How was I?
- You were amazing, baby girl.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.200
- There she is.
- I'm so proud of you.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.249
My superstar.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.805
Oh, Daddy loves you.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.166
You made me cry.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.604
Hey, tell your sister
how good she did.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.364
- You did great, Raina.
- Thanks, Riq.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.524
I have a special surprise
for you, miss.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.411
You can invite four girls to come home
with us and they can sleep over.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.686
- I can?
- Mm-hmm.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.569
- Whoever I want?
- Yes, baby.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.041
You can stay up,
have a good time, watch a movie.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.770
Go ask their moms if it's okay.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.200
- Thank you.
- All right, you're welcome.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.361
Really, Mom?

10:12.520 --> 10:14.284
Tariq, I already
asked Owen's mom

10:14.440 --> 10:16.124
- if it's okay, too, all right?
- You did?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.567
You guys can be in your room
while the girls have the den.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.888
- Thanks, Mom!
- Yes, you're welcome.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.291
Now you better come home
and help me with this shit.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.727
You don't have to go back
to the club right now.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.565
Raina deserves her daddy
on her big day.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.007
- Mr. and Mrs. St. Patrick.
- Hi.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.366
Hello, hi.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.931
Raina was excellent today.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.411
She certainly worked hard enough.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.846
- Yes, she was.
- Thank you.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.490
No, thank you.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.211
Your generous donation
will get that playground finished

10:43.360 --> 10:45.044
in just a couple of months.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.170
We're all very excited about it.
You both should be very proud.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.090
Generous donation?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.325
You see how great she was, right?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.403
Wow, Tasha.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.811
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.769
I got to get back to work
to make some of that money back.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.763
- That's what's wrong with me.
- Babe.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.127
Raina, tell Daddy good-bye.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.726
See you, baby.
Mm, I'm so proud of you.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.924
Babe.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.364
Needs more rosemary.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.050
And it's flat.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.170
- James.
- Cynthia.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.402
Just checking in
on a few final details.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.244
Of course you are.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.210
Now, that works.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.249
- My clients are gonna love this.
- I know they will.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.129
And I'm hoping
this is just the beginning

11:46.280 --> 11:48.203
for our working relationship.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.886
I've told you before,
and I'll say it again.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.804
Your business
is just the springboard

11:52.960 --> 11:54.962
for the kind of nightlife empire
I'm trying to build.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.804
And I am sure you'll do it.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.610
You seem like the kind
of guy that gets what he wants.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.810
I want your word that
I'll get this party again next year.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.442
As tempting as the idea
of spending more time with you is,

12:07.600 --> 12:09.204
James, you know
I can't promise that.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.442
Sure, you can.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.729
We're thinking of having the party
at Art Basel weekend next year.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.643
- In Miami?
- Mm.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.842
Exactly, capitalizing
on the international crowd.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.843
Stern's opening a club
on Ocean Drive.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.890
- Probably do the party there.
- Of course.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.010
We've done New York to death.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.960
It gets so cold here.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.690
I feel trapped after a while.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.525
Miami, it'd be warm, sunny...

12:38.200 --> 12:39.406
fresh start.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.684
A fresh start.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.005
Cynthia Sheridan signed
the final contracts for the party.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.083
Any of the guests
puke on the banquettes again,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.730
she'll pay for reupholstery herself.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.882
Have it in print.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.405
That's funny.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.965
You okay, boss?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.690
Absolutely.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.127
Doesn't seem like it.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.044
Speaking of Cynthia,
did she tell you

13:16.200 --> 13:18.680
next year's party's
gonna be in Miami?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.251
No shit.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.046
One of Simon Stern's clubs.
That motherfucker's everywhere.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.247
South Beach is hot.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.402
I worked as a promoter
there a couple of winters.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.050
You still know people down there?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.969
Yeah, I do.
Why?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.561
Get your food while it's hot.
Come on, girls, eat up.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.449
There's plenty for everybody.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.284
- Ladies first.
- Tariq, stop it.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.283
Come on.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.090
And make sure
you take a napkin, all right?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.925
Be careful, don't spill
anything on the couch.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.326
- Let me get two.
- Get that pillow.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.689
I never did
anything like this for you.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.367
I see you trying
to do better by these kids.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.006
I am.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.242
I'm just trying to be a good...

14:13.720 --> 14:15.768
Where's James?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.568
He's with another woman.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.811
Told you that club was trouble.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.803
Some model or something?

14:36.880 --> 14:38.769
I wish it was like that.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.288
Shawn told me
her name is Angela.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.961
You were right.
You happy now?

14:47.120 --> 14:50.124
- I couldn't keep him.
- Of course I'm not happy.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.641
I remember how this felt.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.803
Your father would come home,
take a shower,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.163
and get in bed
next to me like it was nothing.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.966
Then he stopped
taking that shower.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.800
I talked to LaKeisha about it.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.371
I'm just gonna get a lawyer,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.045
and I'm sure
I'll get custody of the kids.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.965
LaKeisha is as simple
as two plus two.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.286
You are married
to a drug dealer, Tash.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.130
Ghost would never hurt me.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.965
There are all different
kinds of hurt, baby.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.441
What would you do
if you had to leave tonight?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.364
Do you have any money
of your own?

15:30.520 --> 15:33.490
The legit accounts
are in both our names.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.210
I can get half of that.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.044
I done told you before,

15:37.200 --> 15:41.046
you ain't got no legal claim
on his illegal money.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.202
That's what you need to survive.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.523
You've got to have a plan.

15:46.680 --> 15:50.571
You got to look
before you leap, baby.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.040
I have something for you, Angie.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.010
Jamie,
no more gifts,

16:03.160 --> 16:05.845
no more lingerie,
no more shoes.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.048
Just you.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.645
Okay, me.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.724
We're going to Miami
for the weekend.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.564
- What?
- Yeah.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.087
I'm gonna open a Truth
down there like I said I would.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.686
I thought everything
with Stern went sideways.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.969
It did go sideways,
so I'm gonna do it on my own.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.485
Kantos knows
some people down there.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.051
He's gonna arrange
some meetings for me.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.409
I'm gonna look at rental space
while I'm there.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.484
I want your opinion.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.290
I want you to be with me.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.965
Think, the beach, the sun.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.920
- Waking up together.
- A fresh start.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.328
What will you tell Tasha
about where you're going?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.602
A business trip.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.048
But I don't want you
to think about all that, all right?

16:52.240 --> 16:54.447
Just come with me.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.887
Just come with me to Miami.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.202
I would love to.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.089
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.641
- Bye, Ian.
- Talk later, bye.

17:14.839 --> 17:15.965
I'll just meet you after class.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.127
We have to be careful.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.451
That's so cute.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.648
- You like it?
- Yeah.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.962
I saw it today and thought of you.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.485
Here.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.401
- I love this.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.767
Yeah?

17:52.960 --> 17:54.200
Need a car
to meet us at the airport.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.169
We're staying
at the Fontainebleau.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.765
Uh, sure, it's St. Patrick.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.410
Yo, man, what's up?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.648
Tommy?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.211
Yeah?

18:16.760 --> 18:19.491
Gentlemen,
I apologize for the theatrics,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.927
but your government
has been observing my every move.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.361
So I am gonna take
every precaution necessary

18:24.520 --> 18:27.683
to conceal my location.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.241
Besides...

18:30.400 --> 18:31.526
now we all just get to relax.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.445
I think we'd relax a lot better
if we weren't tied up, jefe.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.841
Very well.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.489
It seems like your plan
to solve your problem

18:42.680 --> 18:45.126
required the killing
of everybody in your organization.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.009
Took some time
to find the man responsible.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.686
- He handled that personally.
- He was a friend of mine, jefe.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.365
I owed him that much.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.045
Bravo, Ghost, huh?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.850
Eres old school, man.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.085
Iguales.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.405
- Do you have a plan to rebuild?
- Sure as shit.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.801
We're already in touch
with the new leader of the RSKs,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.604
the Taínos are back in the fold.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.081
Everybody's getting in line.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.402
- Is that true, Ghost?
- Sí.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.607
That's good,
'cause from now on,

19:20.800 --> 19:23.770
I need you to distribute
double the amount of product.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.249
I was betrayed.
Mm-hmm.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.724
My operation in California
has been irretrievably compromised.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.407
And until that situation is resolved,

19:36.560 --> 19:40.645
I have product in the pipeline
that needs distribution.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.564
- We got that.
- We're not set up, jefe.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.484
Oh, no, we got
more than enough contacts

19:44.640 --> 19:45.926
to double our output.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.929
But we have to work out
the logistics, which takes time.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.849
We got-- we're ready.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.800
Hmm?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.564
Why are you so unsure?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.050
I just don't want
to give you my word, jefe,

20:06.200 --> 20:07.964
unless I can guarantee
your distribution.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.121
Mm-hmm.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.201
Saying no would be...

20:50.680 --> 20:52.284
Oh, we're not saying no.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.086
We're just saying that we need
some time to set up a plan.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.083
To move your weight.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.686
Allow you the opportunity
to approve personnel.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.002
Fine.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.208
I will wait to hear your plan.

21:04.360 --> 21:08.524
Are we sure
that the threat to your-- hmm--

21:09.960 --> 21:13.043
to our business is over?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.123
Fantasma, did you get
the right guy?

21:19.280 --> 21:22.443
Yes.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.524
I have to say,
I'm so relieved...

21:32.680 --> 21:34.603
that we were able to work this out.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.203
I would have hated
to have to kill you today.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.407
Me, too.

21:51.240 --> 21:55.564
Fantasma, I'll be expecting
your call, hmm?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.085
Hmm?

22:13.920 --> 22:16.207
That was bananas, man!

22:16.360 --> 22:18.249
Who would have thought
when we woke up this morning

22:18.440 --> 22:21.011
that crazy motherfucker'd
do us like this?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.605
I'll take it, though, for real.
I'll take it.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.081
Twice our product?
This is huge.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.691
What the fuck was that
back there?

22:26.840 --> 22:28.410
"I don't know, jefe.
Give us time."

22:28.560 --> 22:30.767
He could have killed us.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.763
If we fuck it up,
we're only delaying the inevitable.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.445
Don't matter what Lobos says.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.204
Twice the product
means twice the personnel,

22:36.360 --> 22:38.647
- twice the exposure.
- This is the moment we waited for.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.086
Twice the fucking risk, Tommy.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.210
We always wanted to expand.
Now we ain't got to beg for it.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.966
Lobos needs us
to move this shit.

22:46.120 --> 22:49.602
You always said,
"Opportunity is luck plus... "

22:49.800 --> 22:52.280
Preparation, Tommy, but we never
moved weight this big before.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.488
We got to be prepared, man.
We got to think first, all right?

22:54.680 --> 22:56.842
Can't think too long.
Lobos won't wait.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.891
Hold on, man.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.890
Glad to see you finally
got your priorities in order.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.611
This is gonna be
a good thing, Ghost.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.764
I'm gonna go see Ruiz,
get it shored up.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.888
I'll drop you off on the way.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.084
- Double the product?
- It's double everything.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.961
More territory, more enemies,
how are you gonna survive that?

23:44.120 --> 23:47.090
How are we gonna survive that,
you mean.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.844
Because if I'm moving more,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.843
I'm gonna be leaning on you
to do the same.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.684
Line both our
motherfucking pockets.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.888
And I appreciate that,
but let's be honest,

23:55.040 --> 23:56.769
you've been under attack
for months.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.809
We handled that shit.
It's over.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.962
But you need to protect
yourselves in order to rebuild.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.360
And unless you're willing to do that,

24:02.520 --> 24:05.171
then perhaps the Soldado Nation
would be better off

24:05.320 --> 24:06.924
finding itself another connect.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.530
That's fucked up, Ruiz.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.160
Nobody's getting you
better shit than us for the price.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.608
Tommy, I got stitches
holding my lungs together

24:16.760 --> 24:20.048
because Rolla's bitch
missed my heart by a dog's hair.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.168
If I'm gonna get into
something like this with you,

24:22.320 --> 24:24.561
I need to feel secure.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.884
You still get your guns
out of Florida?

24:40.080 --> 24:43.243
I can get more guns,
but they need to be paid for.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.290
We'll pay for it.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.728
From now on, you import guns
for the entire organization.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.163
You'll make more money
than every other primera under us,

24:53.320 --> 24:55.322
and your security is guaranteed.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.528
Sounds good,
but Ghost will never agree to that.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.890
My word's not good enough?

25:24.120 --> 25:25.565
What the fuck
you staring at, man?

25:25.720 --> 25:27.722
Nothing, man.
Nothing.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.921
Tell your mama I said hi.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.684
Relax.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.601
Hello?

25:45.760 --> 25:47.444
Bruja, I need to see you.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.126
Nomar, now's not
a good time for bullshit, okay?

25:50.280 --> 25:53.568
I saw the distributor, mami.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.962
Nah, and he wasn't
in that book you showed me.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.242
Okay, I need to get you
with the sketch artist right away.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.404
No, we got to talk first,
bruja, all right?

26:05.560 --> 26:07.130
Witness protection.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.647
If I I.D. this guy,
I'm a dead man.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.087
I ain't telling you shit
unless I know I'll be safe.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.164
Nomar called.
He saw the distributor last night.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.322
Frankie, we could close this case.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.370
They're shipping our files
off to LA with their thanks.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.284
- Frankie.
- WITSEC? No.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.523
I can't get you witness protection
for Nomar Arcielo.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.842
Angela, it is over.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.526
Move on.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.524
Where's the guy
who's usually outside?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.286
- What guy?
- The guy in the telephone truck.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.761
- You made him?
- Yeah, weeks ago.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.410
But he's not there now.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.369
Look, so we're having
a funding issue.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.091
Government's broke,
but no one knows you're here.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.289
- You're safe.
- Fuck that.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.171
I'm out. Good luck finding
your fucking blanquito.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.607
- I'm leaving town.
- Nomar, I got you WITSEC.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.361
Witness protection?

27:02.520 --> 27:04.807
My boss approved it
this morning.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.204
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.607
But you got to stay here
until I can get the marshals

27:13.760 --> 27:15.728
to take you into custody.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.360
Nah, I got to say
good-bye to some people.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.561
I'll arrange a farewell
with the marshals for your family.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.724
Until then,
don't talk to anyone, okay?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.242
Give me 24 hours.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.089
So Ruiz in?

27:53.520 --> 27:55.522
- He wouldn't commit.
- Motherfucker.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.761
He wants to bring in guns for us.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.082
We put up the money this time,
he straps our whole crew,

27:59.280 --> 28:03.251
but the real problem
is expansion.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.767
I say we go to the Serb and Drift,
some of their friends.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.127
We get North Jersey
and Staten Island on lock.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.089
No, they got their own connect
bringing the product.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.730
To lure them away,
we got to lower our fucking price.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.609
- No wa...
- Or we kill that motherfucker

28:13.760 --> 28:15.125
and make ourselves
the best option.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.611
So let me get this straight.
You're saying that we run

28:16.760 --> 28:17.807
the gun deal with Ruiz,

28:17.960 --> 28:20.566
we hit a major connect,
possibly starting a war.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.161
- That's the plan?
- You got a better idea?

28:25.480 --> 28:28.086
You got to start
trusting me, Ghost.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.810
I was right about Rolla, wasn't I?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.284
I'm your friend.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.801
The moment I detect disloyalty,

28:36.960 --> 28:40.089
I cut it out like a cancer.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.325
You're right, Tommy.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.566
You're right.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.963
I got distracted.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.042
And then you stepped it up.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.924
If you hadn't been about it
all this time,

29:09.080 --> 29:11.128
we wouldn't be
in this position to rebuild.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.408
I shoulda listened to you.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.241
Damn straight,
you shoulda listened to me.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.005
So now I'm listening.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.924
You want to do
the gun deal with Ruiz?

29:25.080 --> 29:27.481
We get street soldiers,
then we expand.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.244
We get the RSKs, the Taínos,

29:29.400 --> 29:31.607
I get Ruiz back in line,
the Haitians, the Serbs,

29:31.760 --> 29:33.000
maybe even the Chinese.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.845
- How fast can we make this happen?
- You say the word, I'll make the calls.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.645
You don't need me
to say the word.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.370
I think you should
take the lead on this,

29:40.520 --> 29:41.726
be the authority on the streets.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.888
What you mean?
We always done this together.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.883
I ain't going anywhere.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.122
But if we're making twice
the amount of money...

29:49.280 --> 29:50.884
hell, maybe I
should open a second club

29:51.040 --> 29:53.202
to clean that money, hmm?

29:53.360 --> 29:55.169
Shit, maybe you should.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.368
I want you to get the respect
you deserve on the streets,

29:57.560 --> 30:01.884
Tommy, so people
don't ask me what I think.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.008
They ask what you think.

30:04.160 --> 30:08.245
We're two men, but we speak
with one voice.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.083
Two men, one voice.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.720
I like that.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.171
So after we get all the commitments,
you make the calls.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.844
Tell 'em we're good to go.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.322
Get that extra cash
in our pocket as fast as we can.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.767
Tommy, one more thing.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.242
We can't expand
beyond this, all right?

30:32.400 --> 30:34.084
Probably the most weight
we can handle.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.924
We'll see.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.524
Oh. It's on.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.290
- Hello?
- Shawn.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.681
Dad?

30:55.840 --> 30:57.171
I need you
to do something for me.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.288
Yeah, anything.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.604
You can't tell your Uncle Ghost,
Tommy, nobody.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.843
I need to know I can trust you.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.647
I need to get Nomar
into WITSEC.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.007
He saw the distributor
the other night.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.562
He saw Ghost, but he won't
sit down with a sketch artist

31:22.720 --> 31:24.051
until I give him
to the marshals.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.204
Well, it usually
doesn't take that long.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.084
Frankie said no.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.248
The task force is done.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.164
I've got him holed up
at the safe house,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.482
but I got to get results
or he's gonna run.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.924
I know you
have friends over there.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.451
Mm.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.204
You can make a call,

31:42.360 --> 31:46.001
maybe shoehorn him in
into another investigation.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.643
Gang violence,
gun possession, kiddie porn.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.606
Anything that would support
Nomar's WITSEC application.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.685
I've, uh, bent the rules for you
more times than I can possibly count.

31:58.840 --> 32:03.482
Frankly, my incentive
to do so has disappeared, so...

32:06.120 --> 32:08.691
He saw Ghost's face.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.285
Greg.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.562
I'll call over there,
see if they have anything current

32:17.720 --> 32:19.529
where Nomar's information
might apply.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.682
- If I get them to do it--
- Thank you.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.081
If I get them to do it,
drinks are on you.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.765
Deal.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.407
Got something
to cheer you up.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.325
She gave them
back to you, huh?

32:37.480 --> 32:39.369
I got those for her.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.210
Bought these for you.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.728
You must really love that girl.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.407
- These ain't cheap.
- I want us all to be a family.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.042
You and Holly getting along,
Ghost back to normal.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.605
Oh, he's back to normal.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.366
Yeah, totally back on track.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.043
He knows what matters now.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.286
You think that's what happened?

33:05.440 --> 33:07.249
Think he...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.722
forgot what matters?

33:12.760 --> 33:15.206
I think maybe for a minute.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.642
But he's back in his senses now.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.004
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.764
It's gonna be
like it always was, T.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.083
The three of us
against the world.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.609
Plus Holly now.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.290
Sure.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.249
Sure.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.402
Papi! Give it back!

34:50.560 --> 34:51.800
Do your homework,
then you get it back.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.563
- I did it already.
- Show me.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.129
Greg, call me
as soon as you hear anything.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.322
I want Nomar in custody.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.084
I'm supposed to get
on a plane tomorrow,

35:40.280 --> 35:43.011
and if we can't get it done,
I should cancel my trip.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.725
Let me know.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.247
- Hey, mamita.
- Oh, hey, Paz.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.051
- I forgot to tell you.
- You going somewhere?

35:52.200 --> 35:54.089
Miami.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.322
They're gonna be doing
some reassignments at work.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.528
I'm looking
at the southern Florida office.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.570
What? That's ridiculous.
There's got to be something closer.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.285
You have a lady boss, right?

36:03.440 --> 36:04.965
Did you tell her about papi?

36:05.120 --> 36:07.088
I did, but--

36:07.240 --> 36:08.924
A work trip, huh?

36:10.240 --> 36:11.651
Okay.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.569
I'm going with Jamie.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.530
He wants to open up a club
in South Beach.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.843
If he does, maybe I'll see
if there's a position at my level

36:21.000 --> 36:23.571
open in the Miami office.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.051
I don't know.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.767
We're going for the weekend,
but we want to make it more permanent,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.127
so maybe Miami's
how we do that.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.170
Maybe that's what he's telling you

36:34.320 --> 36:36.721
because he wants
to keep fucking you.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.166
Jamie loves me.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.129
He told me he's gonna
make things work.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.442
I believe him.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.568
This is changing you, Angela.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.609
You just lied to my face.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.331
I lied because I knew
you wouldn't support me,

36:53.520 --> 36:55.329
because deep down,
I think you want me

36:55.520 --> 36:57.488
to be as alone and unhappy
as you are.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.085
I might be unhappy and alone,

36:59.240 --> 37:01.641
but at least I'm not a chilla.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.963
Can't you see he's making
you like him?

37:05.160 --> 37:09.006
- A liar, a cheat.
- I told you, Jamie and I are in love.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.964
I need you to be happy for me.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.527
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you ruin your life.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.762
Then I need you
to give me the key to my place.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.406
Jamie needs one now,
you don't.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.927
So now we're running
drugs and guns?

37:27.080 --> 37:28.684
Shit, as long as I've known Ghost,

37:28.840 --> 37:30.683
he hasn't been cool with moving heat.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.001
He agreed to that?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.686
He did, but from now on,
I ain't got to ask Ghost.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.161
He trusts me to make moves.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.448
I run the streets,
he cleans the money.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.682
It's all good.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.968
Oh, should I come back?

37:45.480 --> 37:48.006
No, Julio was just leaving.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.124
Holly, Julio.
Julio, Holly.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.725
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.965
It's all there.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.970
Lobos is gonna deliver the powder,
same as always,

38:01.120 --> 38:03.361
but we got to figure out how
to get the guns up from Elizabeth.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.363
I'll get Victor and Darien
ready to make the runs.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.090
Yeah.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.524
Does he work for you?

38:13.680 --> 38:15.011
Yeah.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.045
Ooh, God,
you smell good.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.407
That's nice.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.605
Fuck.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.091
You owe me.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.242
Big.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.402
Your friends
got Nomar into the program?

38:48.560 --> 38:51.245
They are on their way
to get Nomar now for an interview

38:51.400 --> 38:52.765
and a sketch artist, too.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.888
Thank you, Greg.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.122
Thank you so much.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.567
This could be the break
we're looking for.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.446
So you want
to get that drink to celebrate?

39:06.600 --> 39:08.602
I can't.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.923
I'm waiting for a call from a friend
in the southern Florida office.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.360
What, new case?

39:13.520 --> 39:17.889
A prosecutor at my level
is leaving for corporate.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.606
You know how you said
to let Lobos go.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.285
Although now that Nomar's
gonna be in custody,

39:22.440 --> 39:23.885
maybe something can come of it.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.008
Wait, what?

39:27.160 --> 39:28.491
You're going to Miami?

39:29.720 --> 39:31.290
Your father's here.
You said you--

39:38.880 --> 39:40.769
There is a guy.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.121
Was all along.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.691
Is that...

39:45.720 --> 39:47.370
ls that where you're going
with this trip, you're going with him?

39:47.520 --> 39:48.806
It's not like that, Greg.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.328
You know,
you could have just said it.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.802
- Didn't have to lie to my face.
- It wasn't a lie at the time.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.930
- I wasn't sure about him before.
- Are you sure now?

40:17.440 --> 40:19.920
I got it. Yo, yo, yo,
I got it, I got it, I got it.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.526
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I got it.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.409
You look really hot in this thing.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.164
That's the idea.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.840
More ass equals more tips.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.846
You got guys
all over you there every night.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.526
It's a good job.
I make good money.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.367
You're with me now.
You don't need money.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.725
Tell Kantos you quit.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.651
I've never had anybody
take care of me.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.365
I wouldn't be good at it.

40:50.520 --> 40:54.570
But I could work for you maybe.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.967
We'd be in it together.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.887
Ruiz, glad you called.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.042
- That gun thing is a go.
- Fuck the guns.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.885
We could be blood brothers for life
if you do this for me tonight.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.930
I do a favor for you
and you're in?

41:17.200 --> 41:19.487
Good,
what you need, man?

41:19.640 --> 41:22.484
One of my soldiers,
name is Nomar.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.409
Been fucking my little girl.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.410
Sent her a picture
of his goddamn dick.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.564
That's fucked up.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.087
I'll call Julio, send him over.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.051
Naw, can't send
no Latino after Nomar.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.885
If he suspects
that I know about him and Isabel,

41:42.040 --> 41:43.724
he'll be looking for PRs,
somebody that I would send,

41:43.880 --> 41:46.326
but he won't be looking
for a white guy.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.251
- Tomás.
- Got you.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.010
Where can I find him?

42:10.960 --> 42:13.691
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, business trip.

42:13.880 --> 42:16.281
Kantos
has some contacts in Miami.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.966
I'm going tonight to look
at rental space for a second club.

42:20.440 --> 42:24.286
- Second club in Miami?
- Yeah.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.965
Kantos gonna
move down there and run it?

42:26.120 --> 42:28.885
I'd get things started there.
He'll run things here.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.486
Oh, 'cause he got
three kids to look after.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.484
Tasha, if this happens,
I'll see the kids.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.130
I'll fly back and forth
if I have to.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.961
How long
you been planning to go?

42:40.160 --> 42:43.209
- Well, it just came up today.
- I could go with you.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.328
Big Mama can watch the kids.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.403
It's club business, Tasha.

42:47.560 --> 42:48.846
You don't want to hear about it,
remember?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.485
Ever since you've opened that club,

42:52.640 --> 42:54.210
you've been different, Ghost.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.646
It's like I don't know who you are.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.922
I've been trying to tell you, Tasha.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.730
You ain't been listening.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.287
When I get back from Miami,
we should talk.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.888
What'd she say?

43:47.880 --> 43:50.281
She didn't say much.
I think she knew.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.488
We've been growing apart
for a long time, Angie.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.926
You're not the only reason
this happened.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.765
That doesn't make me feel better.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.761
Does this?

44:23.920 --> 44:25.445
Hmm?

44:29.040 --> 44:30.644
I'm all yours now.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.289
And soon I'll be totally free.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.042
Told you I'd come through.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.682
You did and you did.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.484
Mm.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.882
- I need to open a new account.
- Great.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.247
Will we be pulling
from your and Mr. St. Patrick's

45:24.400 --> 45:26.926
joint money market
or joint checking?

45:27.120 --> 45:29.168
We won't be pulling from anywhere.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.765
I see.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.366
I need a checking account
with a debit card.

45:36.520 --> 45:39.490
One debit card, my name only.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.407
- May I borrow your pen, please?
- Of course.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.082
Thank you.

45:47.240 --> 45:50.881
I need all the bank statements sent
to this address in Long Island City,

45:51.040 --> 45:53.327
care of LaKeisha Grant.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.568
Is there anything else,
Mrs. St. Patrick?

46:00.040 --> 46:02.407
Yes, just one thing.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.489
My husband, Mr. St. Patrick,
can't know about this account, okay?

46:06.640 --> 46:08.449
Promise me not to say anything?

46:08.600 --> 46:11.080
I actually can't.

46:11.240 --> 46:15.689
By law I'm not allowed to,
so your secret is safe with me.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.286
Alex, you're so sweet.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.841
Can you let me
into the safety deposit box now?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.206
Yes.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.408
Hey.

46:27.560 --> 46:29.244
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.770
Bruja, Ruiz knows
I'm working for you.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.241
He's gonna try to kill me.
Send help.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.206
Thank you.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.643
I love you.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.485
Fuck.

47:53.520 --> 47:56.091
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.368
See you soon.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.885
Real soon.

48:16.080 --> 48:17.286
Uno más.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.607
Bruja,
Ruiz knows I'm working for you.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.371
He's gonna try to kill me.
Send help.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.249
Greg,
Nomar's been compromised.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.085
We have to get to Queens now.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.446
Hey!

49:49.600 --> 49:50.965
You like to fuck little girls, huh?

49:51.120 --> 49:52.610
Fuck.

49:59.360 --> 50:02.125
Ah!

50:05.360 --> 50:08.125
Ruiz said to bring him your dick.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.801
Ghost.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.121
What did you say?

50:14.640 --> 50:16.085
Nomar?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.884
Nomar?

50:29.320 --> 50:30.970
Nomar?

50:32.320 --> 50:33.845
Shit!

50:35.160 --> 50:37.128
This is AUSA Angela Valdes.

50:37.280 --> 50:40.011
My C.I.'s been stabbed.
I need an ambulance and backup now.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.367
The suspect
might still be in the area.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.364
- Who did this?
- Ghost.

50:51.520 --> 50:54.171
- Where did he go?
- Shit.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.450
No, no, no, Nomar.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.602
Nomar, stay with me.

50:59.760 --> 51:01.683
Don't close your eyes.
Nuh-uh.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.531
James, James.

52:05.720 --> 52:08.644
This is great.
Everyone's having a wonderful time.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.370
That's what I like to hear.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.928
You know, if it weren't
for the whole Miami Art Basel thing,

52:14.080 --> 52:15.923
I'm sure I could get
my clients to bring this party back

52:16.080 --> 52:17.445
to Truth next year.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.523
Well, you might
not have to choose to.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.444
After you and I
had our conversation,

52:21.600 --> 52:22.965
I did some research.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.685
And what would you say,
Cynthia,

52:24.840 --> 52:26.683
if I said I was
opening a Truth in Miami?

52:29.360 --> 52:32.125
Okay, if you
can get it open in time--

52:32.280 --> 52:35.170
God, I shouldn't be saying this--
it's a date.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.651
All right.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.690
Have fun.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.889
Holly, I need you to stay downstairs
and serve the main bar.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.371
I'd rather work upstairs.

52:56.520 --> 52:57.806
All the good people are in VIP.

52:57.960 --> 52:59.166
You do what I say when I say it, okay?

52:59.360 --> 53:00.646
I don't care
if you're sleeping with Tommy.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.723
You still work for me
until you fucking don't.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.565
Well, actually,
tonight's my last night.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.563
Tommy doesn't
want me working here anymore.

53:07.720 --> 53:11.088
I'm gonna work with him
in your other business.

53:11.240 --> 53:14.005
- You're gonna do what?
- That's right.

53:14.160 --> 53:17.721
You and I are partners now, Ghost.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.088
What'd you call me?

53:33.760 --> 53:36.047
Oh. my God!
Oh. my God!

54:54.160 --> 54:56.367
You ain't tell nobody I was
getting out tonight, now, did you?

54:56.560 --> 54:59.928
- No.
- Good.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.809
'Cause I want it to be a surprise.

55:03.320 --> 55:06.130
Your loyalty's
to me first now, right?

55:07.120 --> 55:08.360
Right.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.370
All right.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.041
Let's go.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.685
Hey, this is Jim McClure,

55:53.840 --> 55:56.571
the sketch artist you requested
to work with Nomar Arcielo.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.722
Yeah, hi.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.370
Listen, about that...

56:00.520 --> 56:02.090
They didn't pay my hours.

56:02.240 --> 56:04.720
Something about
the case being closed?

56:04.920 --> 56:06.809
I don't understand.
You never met with Nomar.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.042
- What hours?
- No, I got Mr. Arcielo's number

56:09.200 --> 56:11.806
from Agent Greg Knox.
We spoke on the phone.

56:11.960 --> 56:14.850
But I need to see him
in person to get more details.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.890
I was only able to work
up a partial sketch.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.330
Send it to me.

56:21.520 --> 56:22.851
You have my email?

56:23.880 --> 56:26.360
I'll pay for it out of my own pocket,
just send it to me now.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.721
Jimmy, good to see you again.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.406
- Officer Donato.
- I hate to tell you.

57:07.560 --> 57:10.609
We're gonna have to close
Truth down until further notice.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.570
- How long?
- Could be a month, could be a year.

57:13.720 --> 57:16.405
These things
take time and money.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.050
We'll be in touch.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.886
Fantasma.
I was about to give up on you.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.646
Lobos, we're in,

57:36.800 --> 57:39.041
but not for double the weight.
I need all the product you can send.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.361
All of it.

57:40.560 --> 57:43.325
I'm glad to see
you overcame your hesitation.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.966
I have a sudden need
for a larger influx of cash.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.724
We have a deal.

57:48.960 --> 57:52.681
If you come through,
the rewards will be massive.

57:52.840 --> 57:55.525
- If not, well...
- I know the stakes, jefe.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.290
It's quite a large commitment.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.408
I know.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.885
I'll be the biggest goddamn
drug dealer in New York City.

59:31.700 --> 59:39.700
