WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:13.891
I hereby decree that
Prime Minister Cao Cao

00:13.975 --> 00:16.558
lead the Imperial Army

00:16.600 --> 00:19.725
to pacify the rebels Liu Bei and Sun Quan

00:19.808 --> 00:21.266
Thank you, Your Majesty

00:39.600 --> 00:41.850
These people are loyal to the Han Empire

00:41.933 --> 00:44.391
They followed us to
escape Cao Cao's regime

00:45.433 --> 00:47.308
If we do not protect civilians,

00:47.391 --> 00:49.266
then what is the meaning of this war?

00:52.266 --> 00:55.266
An alliance will strengthen us both

01:02.808 --> 01:07.266
When a loser joins forces with a coward,

01:07.350 --> 01:08.558
what can they accomplish?

01:09.308 --> 01:12.641
What the Southlands need is unity!

01:17.683 --> 01:19.391
My decision to fight is final

01:19.433 --> 01:22.266
Anyone who dares mention surrender

01:22.350 --> 01:25.475
will end up like this table!

01:28.808 --> 01:30.891
You need to fight this war

01:32.850 --> 01:34.725
I am not afraid of him

01:34.766 --> 01:36.766
I have been waiting for this day!

01:38.225 --> 01:41.725
We shall fight, not waste time with words

01:50.808 --> 01:53.766
Make camp there!

01:53.850 --> 01:55.975
On the bank facing Red Cliff

01:58.808 --> 02:00.391
Tomorrow we may be enemies

02:00.475 --> 02:02.391
If that day ever comes,

02:02.433 --> 02:04.808
it will be each man for himself

02:06.475 --> 02:08.225
Cao Cao has no experience in naval warfare

02:08.265 --> 02:10.265
He must rely on Admirals
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun

02:10.350 --> 02:12.600
If I can eliminate them,

02:12.683 --> 02:14.975
his navy will be powerless

02:53.850 --> 02:55.975
Nice play!

03:06.683 --> 03:07.641
Goal!

03:07.725 --> 03:10.516
These little monkeys are getting quicker!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.558
The Prime Minister's order
to practice Cuju (kickball)

03:12.641 --> 03:15.850
Has toughened these kids up

03:21.433 --> 03:23.558
Follow closely

03:48.433 --> 03:49.891
Carry him inside quickly

04:15.683 --> 04:16.891
Follow me

04:43.850 --> 04:45.433
Just my stomach growling

04:47.433 --> 04:48.350
Yes!

04:48.433 --> 04:51.391
Goal!

04:58.683 --> 05:00.766
What do you think? Not bad, right?

05:07.433 --> 05:08.683
Block him!

05:44.683 --> 05:45.975
Yeah!

05:59.683 --> 06:01.308
Yeah!

06:28.516 --> 06:30.933
That pot isn't wide enough

06:30.975 --> 06:34.100
You would miss no matter how wide it was

06:34.183 --> 06:37.725
Pitch pot is a game for aristocrats

06:37.808 --> 06:41.433
not for soldiers in wartime

06:45.183 --> 06:47.725
Your Honor,
how'd you throw that bull's eye?

06:47.766 --> 06:49.308
Concentration

06:49.391 --> 06:50.808
When the enemy is over-confident,

06:50.891 --> 06:52.891
we must double our concentration

06:52.975 --> 06:56.266
With concentration,
you can kill a giant with a pebble

06:58.891 --> 07:01.600
Your Highness, Zhou Yu's army is small

07:01.683 --> 07:04.225
He'll have to resort to guerilla warfare

07:04.266 --> 07:05.725
That last puny victory

07:05.766 --> 07:07.850
has made Zhou Yu cocky

07:07.933 --> 07:09.766
He's no guerilla warrior

07:09.850 --> 07:13.183
He will confront us face to face

07:15.933 --> 07:17.475
They are readying for battle

07:17.558 --> 07:20.266
We need a strategy to counter them

07:22.683 --> 07:24.891
Cao Cao wants to surround us

07:24.975 --> 07:26.850
without breaking the
basic rules of strategy

07:26.933 --> 07:29.225
The first army to the field will be rested

07:29.266 --> 07:31.766
The second army will arrive exhausted

07:31.850 --> 07:33.475
Attack where the enemy is least prepared

07:33.558 --> 07:34.891
Strike where they least expect it

07:34.933 --> 07:36.641
We must concentrate all forces

07:36.725 --> 07:38.433
on their strongest position

07:40.850 --> 07:45.225
Naval victory depends on

07:45.266 --> 07:49.225
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun

07:49.266 --> 07:51.391
We are loyal to Your Highness until death

07:52.266 --> 07:53.558
Cao Cao underestimates us

07:53.600 --> 07:55.975
He will never expect us to hit their navy

08:04.933 --> 08:06.391
What is your name?

08:06.433 --> 08:08.475
Private Sun Shucai

08:08.558 --> 08:10.433
You are an outstanding player

08:10.475 --> 08:13.225
and a good soldier

08:13.308 --> 08:14.891
From this day forward

08:14.975 --> 08:18.600
you are promoted to battalion commander

08:18.683 --> 08:20.558
Thank you, Your Highness!

08:20.600 --> 08:23.475
Everyone must practice hard at Cuju

08:23.558 --> 08:26.683
Only with tough bodies can we win this war

08:26.766 --> 08:29.891
Once the Southlands are subdued,

08:29.933 --> 08:34.765
your families will be exempt
from taxes for three years

08:36.640 --> 08:38.850
Thank you, Your Highness!

09:12.891 --> 09:14.391
What are you doing?

09:15.641 --> 09:17.933
I'm... setting these birds free

09:19.225 --> 09:21.725
That's very kind of you

09:29.725 --> 09:30.891
You're leaving?

09:33.933 --> 09:37.350
By your accent, I bet you're a Southerner

09:37.433 --> 09:39.350
That's right

09:39.433 --> 09:41.391
Southerners are warm-hearted people

09:41.475 --> 09:42.933
Northerners are free-spirited

09:42.975 --> 09:44.433
I'm kind of dumb

09:44.516 --> 09:47.350
People say my entire life...

09:47.433 --> 09:50.225
You're not dumb, just too honest

09:54.600 --> 09:56.183
You're good at Cuju

09:57.266 --> 09:58.891
Thanks for heading the ball

10:00.266 --> 10:01.391
What's your name?

10:01.475 --> 10:02.850
My name is...

10:04.641 --> 10:05.891
Look at the size of me

10:05.933 --> 10:09.766
My mother calls me Piggy

10:09.850 --> 10:10.975
Piggy?

10:11.850 --> 10:14.475
So you can play Cuju right?

10:14.558 --> 10:17.600
You kidding? I only know hacky-sack

10:17.683 --> 10:20.600
Congratulations on your promotion

10:20.641 --> 10:24.433
So does a commander get bigger meals?

10:24.516 --> 10:25.600
You're a big officer now

10:25.683 --> 10:28.433
You can eat as much as you want

10:28.516 --> 10:31.350
Are you fighting just to
fill your stomach?

10:31.433 --> 10:33.308
Mother says my stomach is a bottomless pit

10:33.391 --> 10:36.433
My family's too poor to feed me

10:36.516 --> 10:39.183
We're Pit and Piggy!

10:39.266 --> 10:40.558
What a pair!

10:42.391 --> 10:45.433
The new environment has made our men ill

10:45.516 --> 10:48.100
They are weak from a long war

10:48.183 --> 10:49.808
and have lost all immunity

10:49.891 --> 10:52.100
So typhoid quickly...

10:52.183 --> 10:53.725
Can it be cured?

10:53.808 --> 10:55.391
Yes

10:55.433 --> 10:57.516
but not overnight

11:05.766 --> 11:07.725
How many have died?

11:07.766 --> 11:09.850
Over a hundred

11:09.933 --> 11:11.725
In a few days, it will be out of control

11:11.766 --> 11:14.183
We must bury them right away

11:14.266 --> 11:15.641
No burials! We must cremate

11:15.725 --> 11:18.350
Cremation is the only way
to stop its spread

11:19.600 --> 11:21.641
Ready the funeral pyres Yes, sir

11:21.725 --> 11:23.266
Hold on

11:34.183 --> 11:35.766
(Epidemic outbreak)

11:37.850 --> 11:40.225
The climate has weakened Cao Cao's army

11:40.266 --> 11:42.641
Disease is rampant Great

11:42.725 --> 11:46.683
Your Honor, let's seize
this chance and attack

11:46.766 --> 11:48.516
The navy is still healthy

11:48.600 --> 11:49.683
We must not act recklessly

11:49.766 --> 11:52.225
Your Honor, this is the time to attack!

11:52.266 --> 11:53.766
Yes!

11:53.808 --> 11:56.516
This is a battle of honor

11:56.600 --> 11:58.558
Even war must be fair

12:30.558 --> 12:32.891
Your Highness

12:32.933 --> 12:35.766
isn't this a bit inhumane?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.266
Cast off the soldiers of the dead!

13:07.183 --> 13:08.600
What's the matter?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.933
Pull the boats here

13:32.725 --> 13:33.683
Look, what is that?

13:33.766 --> 13:35.183
Pull it here

13:38.808 --> 13:40.391
Pull the boats here

13:43.266 --> 13:45.808
Go report this to the general
Yes, sir

14:13.725 --> 14:15.808
Pile weapons and armor here

14:16.600 --> 14:18.225
Put the corpses there

14:18.266 --> 14:19.683
Yes, sir

14:24.600 --> 14:25.975
Get away from here

14:39.891 --> 14:41.225
Don't touch them!

14:41.266 --> 14:43.558
They died from typhoid!

14:43.641 --> 14:45.850
Move! It's contagious!

14:45.933 --> 14:48.183
Move! Don't touch anything!

14:48.266 --> 14:49.558
Get out of here!

14:49.600 --> 14:51.225
Everyone must leave!

14:51.933 --> 14:54.808
Escort these people away

14:54.891 --> 14:56.225
This is for your own good

14:56.433 --> 14:57.600
This place is infected

14:57.683 --> 14:58.933
Leave here immediately

15:20.766 --> 15:23.391
Cao Cao is truly ruthless

15:24.516 --> 15:26.600
Those soldiers have touched corpses

15:26.683 --> 15:27.891
I've quarantined them

15:27.975 --> 15:29.933
so they do not infect others

15:32.308 --> 15:34.266
And the villagers?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.391
I fear many have already been infected

15:36.475 --> 15:40.391
Cao Cao has stooped to evil tricks

15:40.433 --> 15:42.100
This is psychological warfare

15:42.183 --> 15:44.308
He's attacking our morale

15:46.641 --> 15:48.891
How to dispose of the bodies?

15:48.975 --> 15:50.725
These are the bodies of our enemies

15:50.766 --> 15:52.808
Feed them to the fishes

15:52.891 --> 15:55.516
No, we must lay them to rest

15:55.600 --> 15:57.350
No burials

15:57.433 --> 15:58.891
We must cremate them

16:47.433 --> 16:50.225
I lift my drink and sing a song

16:50.266 --> 16:53.391
For who knows if life be short or long

16:54.808 --> 16:57.266
Man's life is but the morning dew

16:57.350 --> 17:00.475
Past days many, future ones few

17:02.433 --> 17:03.891
The melancholy my heart begets

17:03.975 --> 17:06.724
Comes from cares I cannot forget

17:06.766 --> 17:09.266
Who can unravel these woes of mine?

17:09.349 --> 17:13.349
I know but one man... the God of Wine!

17:14.683 --> 17:16.849
Disciples dressed in blue

17:16.933 --> 17:19.599
My heart worries for you

17:19.683 --> 17:21.724
You are the cause

17:21.808 --> 17:24.391
Of this song without pause

17:24.433 --> 17:26.808
Across the bank a deer bleats

17:26.891 --> 17:29.350
in the wilds where it eats

17:30.350 --> 17:32.558
Honored guests I salute

17:32.600 --> 17:35.683
Strike the harp! Play the flute!

17:40.266 --> 17:42.516
Bright is the moon's spark

17:44.600 --> 17:47.183
Never ceasing, never dark

17:48.433 --> 17:51.308
Thoughts of you from deep inside

17:51.391 --> 17:54.600
Cannot settle, cannot subside

17:55.933 --> 17:57.683
Stars around the moon are few

17:57.766 --> 17:59.891
Southward the crows flew

17:59.975 --> 18:01.850
Flying with no rest

18:01.933 --> 18:04.183
Where shall they nest?

18:04.266 --> 18:05.891
No mountain too steep

18:05.975 --> 18:07.808
No ocean too deep

18:07.891 --> 18:09.850
Sages rush when guests call

18:09.933 --> 18:11.725
So at their feet...

18:14.433 --> 18:15.975
the empire does fall!

18:36.641 --> 18:38.808
Take your time. Careful, it's hot

18:44.683 --> 18:46.225
More fall sick every day

18:46.308 --> 18:47.308
You have enough medicine?

18:47.391 --> 18:49.391
Cassia trees are scarce here

18:49.433 --> 18:51.558
Our men will keep searching

18:52.808 --> 18:56.350
Can cassia cure typhoid?

18:56.433 --> 18:58.683
It will ease current symptoms

18:58.766 --> 19:01.725
But a true cure requires other ingredients

19:18.891 --> 19:21.308
Let me take a look

19:35.808 --> 19:39.266
Hurry! Carry our men out!

19:39.308 --> 19:40.641
Move it!

19:40.725 --> 19:42.850
Stand up, let's go

19:42.933 --> 19:44.308
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

19:44.391 --> 19:45.308
What are you doing?

19:45.391 --> 19:48.350
General, what are you doing?

19:48.433 --> 19:50.183
These patients cannot be moved

19:50.266 --> 19:53.266
Hurry! Put our men on the horses

19:53.350 --> 19:55.225
Please, these men must not leave

19:55.266 --> 19:57.725
They are still ill

19:59.600 --> 20:01.225
You're leaving?

20:08.891 --> 20:15.141
Viceroy, this epidemic
is beyond our control

20:15.225 --> 20:17.391
I have barely twenty thousand men

20:17.433 --> 20:20.891
If this continues, I might lose everything

20:20.933 --> 20:24.516
I must retreat and reformulate my strategy

20:24.600 --> 20:28.391
You withdraw at a moment like this?

20:28.433 --> 20:30.558
You proposed this alliance

20:30.641 --> 20:33.183
Now with our lives at stake, you flee?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.683
This is betrayal

20:34.766 --> 20:36.683
You can't say that

20:36.766 --> 20:38.308
We are men of our word

20:38.391 --> 20:40.725
But look what has happened to our men

20:40.766 --> 20:43.308
So our men count for nothing?

20:45.225 --> 20:47.391
Selfishness Who is selfish?

20:47.475 --> 20:48.891
Zhang Fei! General!

20:51.558 --> 20:54.600
My Lord, the battle is set

20:54.683 --> 20:56.266
How can you... Zhu-ge Liang

20:59.891 --> 21:02.766
I have seen over a decade of defeat

21:02.850 --> 21:05.141
I cannot endure another setback

21:05.225 --> 21:10.891
Even soldiers must obey
the law of survival

21:10.975 --> 21:13.141
We must not lose our allies' trust

21:13.225 --> 21:15.266
I know you feel strongly

21:15.350 --> 21:18.725
But in chaotic times,
you cannot live on justice alone

21:18.766 --> 21:22.225
It's time I let others
fight the tough battles

21:24.683 --> 21:28.558
One day you will understand this

21:30.933 --> 21:32.433
Liu Bei

21:35.350 --> 21:39.433
It was an honor to fight
alongside your men

21:39.516 --> 21:42.391
We believed in the same goal

21:42.433 --> 21:45.766
Achieving it will not be so easy after all

21:45.850 --> 21:47.266
Take care

21:48.516 --> 21:49.975
Take care

22:03.391 --> 22:04.725
We shall meet again

22:13.433 --> 22:14.725
Aren't you leaving?

22:18.266 --> 22:20.183
A man must honor his promises

22:20.266 --> 22:23.683
If I start something, I see it to the end

22:23.766 --> 22:26.850
Anyone who talks like that is insane

22:28.433 --> 22:30.225
Then we are all insane

22:50.683 --> 22:52.850
Your Highness, tea is ready

22:59.266 --> 23:00.725
Brother, scouts report

23:00.766 --> 23:02.350
the typhoid was successful

23:02.433 --> 23:04.641
The Southlands are in chaos

23:05.600 --> 23:07.266
Good One more thing

23:07.350 --> 23:09.725
Liu Bei has left with all his men

23:09.808 --> 23:11.391
Good

23:11.475 --> 23:13.391
Their alliance is broken

23:15.808 --> 23:16.850
Excellent

24:12.600 --> 24:14.558
Swift as the wind

24:21.641 --> 24:23.766
Gentle as a forest

24:35.350 --> 24:36.975
Fierce as fire

24:47.225 --> 24:48.683
Firm as a mountain

24:59.933 --> 25:01.558
If you hate war,

25:01.600 --> 25:03.641
why can you quote "The Art of War"

25:03.725 --> 25:05.683
To understand you,

25:05.766 --> 25:08.725
I must sneak glances at your books

25:09.975 --> 25:13.266
A thousand books cannot
equal a cup of your tea

25:14.600 --> 25:16.975
I'm happy so long as you enjoy it

25:19.933 --> 25:22.558
I wish we could invite Cao Cao for tea

25:22.641 --> 25:25.600
Forget the war and just enjoy the scenery

25:25.683 --> 25:27.391
Wouldn't that be great?

25:28.808 --> 25:31.266
I doubt he appreciates the art of tea

25:33.725 --> 25:35.725
You wield your sword

25:35.808 --> 25:38.683
like you know a way to beat Cao Cao

25:39.725 --> 25:41.391
A way as mysterious as darkness

25:42.725 --> 25:44.600
And as powerful as thunder

25:48.433 --> 25:50.433
It is time for us to act

26:05.308 --> 26:07.766
Greetings, Your Highness

26:07.808 --> 26:11.516
How goes the naval training, Admirals?

26:11.600 --> 26:13.725
Very well, Your Highness

26:13.766 --> 26:17.683
We're using iron beams to join the fleet

26:17.766 --> 26:20.641
Our men are Northerners
and new to naval battle

26:20.725 --> 26:24.183
Now our ships shall be
stable as solid ground

26:24.266 --> 26:27.391
Not even a storm will make our men seasick

26:28.266 --> 26:30.600
Can they be separated? Of course

26:31.516 --> 26:33.475
Men, separate the ships

26:45.766 --> 26:48.225
Unlocking the iron beams
separates the ships

26:48.308 --> 26:51.558
The fleet will move into pincer formation

26:51.641 --> 26:52.725
ready for battle

26:52.766 --> 26:55.350
You truly are naval experts

26:55.433 --> 26:57.266
to invent this tactic

26:57.350 --> 26:58.600
Thank you, Your Highness

26:59.266 --> 27:02.391
Jiang Gan
At your service, Your Highness

27:02.475 --> 27:04.558
You grew up with Zhou Yu, right?

27:04.641 --> 27:07.683
Yes, we were childhood friends

27:07.766 --> 27:10.100
Cross the river. Urge him to surrender

27:10.183 --> 27:11.891
Surrender?

27:11.975 --> 27:15.183
Zhou Yu's loyalty to Sun Quan runs deep

27:15.266 --> 27:16.516
I'm afraid he won't...

27:16.600 --> 27:17.725
The Southlands are falling apart

27:17.808 --> 27:19.558
Liu Bei has fled

27:19.641 --> 27:22.183
Now is the time to ask
Zhou Yu to surrender

27:22.266 --> 27:23.766
Yes, Your Highness

27:48.808 --> 27:51.391
Piggy. Scared you didn't I?

27:59.933 --> 28:01.433
These guys keep tailing me

28:01.516 --> 28:03.725
How can I have any fun like this?

28:05.266 --> 28:08.350
You're battalion commander

28:08.433 --> 28:10.391
They have to follow you

28:14.266 --> 28:16.766
Listen up! Everyone go practice Cuju

28:16.850 --> 28:18.350
Yes, sir!

28:23.433 --> 28:25.266
It worked!

28:25.350 --> 28:28.350
Let's have some fun! Great

28:31.225 --> 28:33.850
What should we play? Let's play...

28:33.933 --> 28:35.641
Let's play Ride High

28:35.725 --> 28:37.683
OK. Come on

28:40.933 --> 28:42.308
You really are heavy

28:42.391 --> 28:44.266
Your mother gave you the right nickname

28:47.433 --> 28:49.725
This isn't high enough. Let's go up there

28:49.766 --> 28:51.350
Watch your balance

28:52.308 --> 28:53.850
Be careful

28:53.933 --> 28:55.850
This high enough for you?

28:55.933 --> 28:57.975
Yeah. Stay still

29:06.725 --> 29:08.683
That itches Itches?

29:09.850 --> 29:11.558
Here, let me scratch it

29:12.600 --> 29:14.225
Much better

29:17.725 --> 29:18.683
Turn left

29:18.766 --> 29:20.350
What's so interesting there?
It's just the fleet

29:20.433 --> 29:21.891
Don't move

29:27.516 --> 29:28.433
My Lord

29:28.516 --> 29:32.516
Cao Cao has several
hundred thousand soldiers

29:32.600 --> 29:34.850
We have only thirty thousand

29:34.933 --> 29:37.850
We are totally outnumbered

29:37.933 --> 29:40.350
How can we fight like this?

29:40.433 --> 29:43.183
This will decide the fate
of the Southlands

29:43.266 --> 29:45.975
We must fight even if we cannot win

29:47.933 --> 29:49.391
How many arrows do we have?

29:49.475 --> 29:51.683
Not even fifty thousand

29:51.766 --> 29:55.266
Liu Bei took forty thousand when he fled

29:56.641 --> 29:59.391
Without those arrows, we cannot fight

29:59.475 --> 30:02.891
The arrows are my responsibility

30:02.933 --> 30:06.516
As well they should be
Your Lord took them

30:06.600 --> 30:09.308
We need one hundred thousand arrows

30:09.391 --> 30:12.183
You still think you can handle it?

30:12.266 --> 30:16.225
Fine, if I cannot come up
with one hundred thousand,

30:16.308 --> 30:18.225
you may take my head

30:19.391 --> 30:21.308
We only have food for ten days

30:21.391 --> 30:23.725
I give you ten days' time

30:23.766 --> 30:27.391
I don't need ten, just three

30:27.475 --> 30:29.475
We soldiers do not joke

30:31.266 --> 30:35.266
You said you'd eliminate
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun

30:35.350 --> 30:37.183
If not, then what?

30:39.725 --> 30:41.391
You may have my head

30:53.516 --> 30:57.475
By night, the Milky Way
By day, snaking clouds

31:06.641 --> 31:08.183
You were here all night

31:08.266 --> 31:10.516
What are you up to?

31:10.600 --> 31:12.225
See for yourself

31:12.308 --> 31:14.433
Wind and water converge here

31:14.516 --> 31:15.766
The feng shui is excellent

31:15.850 --> 31:17.641
Glad you're relaxed

31:17.725 --> 31:19.808
You are worrying me to death

31:19.891 --> 31:22.308
The twenty ships with crew

31:22.391 --> 31:23.725
you requested are ready

31:29.975 --> 31:31.850
There's only one day left

31:31.933 --> 31:34.808
Where are the arrows?
You haven't made even one

31:34.891 --> 31:36.516
You should be in a nervous sweat

31:36.600 --> 31:38.350
My sweat is of no concern

31:38.433 --> 31:41.433
But see if the tortoise is sweating

31:43.766 --> 31:45.225
It is

31:46.475 --> 31:50.183
As I predicted, fog is coming

31:50.266 --> 31:51.516
What fog?

31:51.600 --> 31:53.391
The only fog here is around my head

31:54.433 --> 31:56.266
What is this plan of yours?

31:56.350 --> 31:58.641
Nature's secrets cannot be revealed

32:00.808 --> 32:06.225
Old cow plows the paddy's rows

32:06.266 --> 32:11.308
Young calf munches on what grows

32:11.391 --> 32:13.225
You really are something

32:13.266 --> 32:17.350
Back then you were just
a kid who loved to sing

32:17.433 --> 32:21.183
Who'd have guessed that kid
would be a Viceroy

32:22.391 --> 32:27.141
Planting rice is the old man's chore

32:27.225 --> 32:30.725
We were ten when you clubbed
that bandit from behind

32:30.808 --> 32:33.725
He spun around and somehow
the club was in my hands

32:33.766 --> 32:37.891
He gave me the beating of my life

32:37.975 --> 32:44.850
In the sedan chair the young boy snores

32:44.933 --> 32:47.391
To this day I still don't understand

32:47.475 --> 32:49.391
how that club got into my hand

32:49.433 --> 32:51.183
You're too slow

32:59.266 --> 33:00.391
You remember that time

33:00.433 --> 33:04.266
I wrote on the tutor's exam book
in your handwriting

33:04.350 --> 33:06.558
Senile idiot!

33:06.641 --> 33:08.100
That's right!

33:08.183 --> 33:11.558
He gave me twenty swats across my butt

33:11.641 --> 33:14.141
Back in those days,

33:14.225 --> 33:15.850
there was no prank we didn't pull

33:15.933 --> 33:18.558
I can trick any man I meet

33:18.641 --> 33:21.891
But with you, I always play the fool

33:24.308 --> 33:25.641
Bring my sword!

33:31.600 --> 33:32.891
Marvelous!

34:01.433 --> 34:03.891
You are a fine sword dancer

34:14.933 --> 34:16.683
Are you here as Cao Cao's emissary?

34:16.766 --> 34:18.391
Me?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.516
I can barely speak for myself

34:21.600 --> 34:23.391
How could I speak for Cao Cao?

34:23.433 --> 34:25.100
I'm not as clever as you

34:25.183 --> 34:27.641
but I know what song you're singing

34:27.725 --> 34:29.683
You do not give me enough credit

34:29.766 --> 34:31.600
I'd never disrespect a talented Southerner

34:31.683 --> 34:33.850
but to serve Cao Cao is wrong

34:33.933 --> 34:36.391
You have your Lord and I have mine, but...

34:36.433 --> 34:38.308
No matter

34:38.391 --> 34:39.641
A few days from now

34:39.725 --> 34:42.433
someone will lay Cao Cao's head at my feet

34:42.516 --> 34:43.975
You believe me?

34:45.558 --> 34:46.725
Yes, I do

34:46.808 --> 34:48.725
Your Honor, urgent news!

34:48.808 --> 34:50.725
Can't you see I have a guest?

35:03.475 --> 35:05.683
I know we've no arrows

35:05.766 --> 35:07.641
If Zhu-ge Liang fails to get more,

35:07.725 --> 35:08.725
I'll have his head

35:08.808 --> 35:11.641
Maybe our friends
across the river can help

35:11.725 --> 35:14.183
They have a more important mission

35:14.266 --> 35:16.308
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun report

35:16.391 --> 35:18.350
Cao Cao's head cannot be taken just yet

35:18.433 --> 35:19.433
I fear...

35:19.516 --> 35:20.891
Do not underestimate them

35:20.933 --> 35:22.558
Here is their message

35:27.600 --> 35:28.891
Excellent!

35:31.433 --> 35:32.725
Mr. Jiang

35:34.475 --> 35:36.475
What are you doing here alone?

35:36.558 --> 35:38.891
Mrs. Zhou? Come sit inside

35:38.975 --> 35:41.641
Xiao Qiao, bring more wine

35:41.725 --> 35:43.516
Any more and you'll be drunk

35:43.600 --> 35:46.225
Come on, we'll drink more upstairs

35:47.558 --> 35:49.808
Drink more? Why end a good time?

35:50.766 --> 35:56.558
I heard Cao Cao invaded the Southlands
all for your wife

35:57.891 --> 35:59.225
Is that so?

35:59.308 --> 36:02.766
Cao Cao has a reputation
for stealing men's wives

36:03.933 --> 36:06.225
You're drunk More wine

36:06.308 --> 36:08.516
More? Where?

36:52.933 --> 36:54.725
We surrendered to Cao Cao

36:54.808 --> 36:58.100
not for profit but out of desperation

36:58.183 --> 37:01.850
We now have the Northerners
entrapped in camp

37:01.933 --> 37:07.308
Soon we will deliver his decap...

37:07.391 --> 37:08.850
his decapitated head

37:08.933 --> 37:12.391
Further reports to come

37:12.475 --> 37:13.766
Admiral Cai Mao

37:13.850 --> 37:15.558
What are you looking at?

37:18.266 --> 37:20.391
Just one of my tricks

37:21.600 --> 37:24.225
You do love to play tricks on me

37:25.558 --> 37:27.683
I'll trick you again...

37:29.600 --> 37:31.516
and again...

37:34.766 --> 37:38.683
Not this time you won't

38:42.641 --> 38:46.433
Scarecrow, you're more of
a man than that fellow

38:46.516 --> 38:49.350
That fellow doesn't tell me a thing

38:49.433 --> 38:52.141
You're a better drinking buddy

38:52.225 --> 38:53.475
Cheers!

39:10.516 --> 39:11.558
Scarecrow

39:11.641 --> 39:13.725
Why are we heading for the enemy camp?

39:13.766 --> 39:16.308
You're not surrendering, are you?

39:29.850 --> 39:34.516
The enemy! The enemy is approaching!

39:35.308 --> 39:36.600
Separate ships

39:39.891 --> 39:42.350
Send the left flank to intercept the enemy

39:52.808 --> 39:54.558
Faster

40:03.766 --> 40:06.183
Scarecrow, stop drumming

40:06.266 --> 40:08.725
What if Cao Cao's men come for us?

40:08.766 --> 40:10.141
They wouldn't dare

40:10.225 --> 40:12.433
A heavy fog might hide an ambush

40:12.516 --> 40:14.183
Oh, so you've decided to talk to me

40:22.516 --> 40:23.891
Ready all archers

40:24.850 --> 40:26.350
Shoot at first sight

40:30.933 --> 40:32.266
Ready!

40:32.350 --> 40:34.558
All ships line up!

41:04.266 --> 41:06.641
This is a plot to turn us
against each other

41:11.475 --> 41:13.141
We're not fools

41:13.225 --> 41:17.183
Would Zhou Yu use such an obvious trick?

41:17.266 --> 41:20.141
Sometimes the simplest trick

41:20.225 --> 41:22.558
is the best way to lead
someone to their death

41:28.975 --> 41:30.391
Shoot

41:46.808 --> 41:48.225
Shoot!

42:12.725 --> 42:16.225
Your Highness,
whether this is a trick or not,

42:16.308 --> 42:18.558
we should proceed with caution

42:18.641 --> 42:20.600
What if their navy mutinies?

42:20.641 --> 42:22.183
That would be a disaster

42:23.600 --> 42:24.891
Shoot!

42:29.433 --> 42:30.766
Besides the letter,

42:30.850 --> 42:33.350
I heard them mention

42:33.433 --> 42:35.516
friends here would get them arrows

43:06.600 --> 43:07.766
Don't worry

43:07.850 --> 43:09.850
Scarecrow will protect you

43:21.308 --> 43:22.850
Cease drumming!

43:29.808 --> 43:33.183
Call Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun
in for questioning

43:33.266 --> 43:36.391
They are out training the fleet

43:36.475 --> 43:40.225
If they are not here,
then their handwriting is

43:40.266 --> 43:42.725
Bring their letter of surrender

43:42.766 --> 43:45.516
Ready, all ships about-face!

43:45.600 --> 43:46.891
What?

44:04.183 --> 44:05.225
Drum in unison

44:05.308 --> 44:07.391
Give them a target to shoot

44:12.475 --> 44:14.516
Aim for the drums

44:15.975 --> 44:17.391
shoot

44:21.766 --> 44:23.225
Drink up

44:28.433 --> 44:29.850
Watch your seat

44:35.725 --> 44:36.933
Fire at will!

44:56.266 --> 44:58.766
The handwriting is a perfect match

44:58.808 --> 45:01.350
and full of the same mistakes

45:04.808 --> 45:06.641
This must be the work of Cai Mao

45:06.725 --> 45:08.391
Shoot!

45:30.266 --> 45:31.725
We return home victorious!

45:33.391 --> 45:34.725
Cheers

45:54.850 --> 45:57.766
Nothing but scared mice
Return to your positions!

45:57.850 --> 46:03.683
Return to your positions!

46:03.766 --> 46:06.308
Thank you Prime Minister for your gift

46:06.391 --> 46:09.308
Thank you...

46:37.225 --> 46:38.183
Marvelous!

46:38.266 --> 46:41.391
Mr. Zhu-ge! Look...

46:41.475 --> 46:44.725
How did you know the fog was coming?

46:44.808 --> 46:47.141
A clear Milky Way and snaking clouds

46:47.225 --> 46:48.350
signal fog is near

46:48.433 --> 46:51.600
If you know how earth,
sky, yin and yang change,

46:51.683 --> 46:53.808
then the sun, moon and stars;

46:53.891 --> 46:56.225
the wind, forest, mountains and fire

46:56.266 --> 46:58.391
become soldiers at your command

46:58.475 --> 47:01.350
So you can read
Mother Nature's moods, huh?

47:01.933 --> 47:03.766
We lost one!

47:03.850 --> 47:06.850
What a shame... Hey, come back!

47:49.225 --> 47:52.225
A small victory hardly
deserves such a reception

47:52.308 --> 47:55.266
Your Highness A small victory?

47:55.350 --> 47:57.141
How many men did the enemy send?

47:57.225 --> 47:59.516
Fog covered the river. Impossible to see

47:59.600 --> 48:02.266
If you could not see,
how did you repel them?

48:02.350 --> 48:03.850
Firing at will forced retreat

48:03.933 --> 48:06.850
Firing at will? How many arrows is that?

48:08.350 --> 48:09.850
About one hundred thousand

48:09.933 --> 48:11.350
About one hundred thousand

48:12.266 --> 48:13.766
And why didn't you pursue them?

48:13.850 --> 48:16.100
Fog meant possible ambush, Your Highness

48:16.183 --> 48:17.391
So...

48:17.475 --> 48:19.391
Again with the fog

48:19.433 --> 48:25.683
Seems like you are hiding
something in that fog

48:26.850 --> 48:28.891
Look, a boat is floating this way

48:28.975 --> 48:30.725
Pull it in...

48:58.933 --> 49:00.516
Your Highness

49:00.600 --> 49:03.725
Can't you tell a soldier from a scarecrow?

49:04.766 --> 49:07.683
One hundred thousand arrows?

49:07.766 --> 49:10.225
You're mighty generous

49:10.308 --> 49:11.308
Please forgive me, Your Highness

49:11.391 --> 49:12.516
I deserve death, Your Highness

49:12.600 --> 49:14.391
Today it's arrows

49:14.475 --> 49:17.850
Tomorrow it's my head, am I right?

49:26.350 --> 49:28.350
Zhou Yu is turning us against each other

49:28.433 --> 49:31.266
No spy is stupid enough to...

49:31.350 --> 49:32.600
Silence!

49:33.975 --> 49:37.850
I trust and honor talented men

49:37.933 --> 49:42.725
But I abhor deceivers and traitors

49:42.766 --> 49:44.475
Guards!

49:45.183 --> 49:47.558
Your Highness,
we have trained day and night

49:47.600 --> 49:49.558
Take them away and behead them

49:49.641 --> 49:52.225
We swear our loyalty to Your Highness

49:52.725 --> 49:55.225
Didn't I surrender to a benevolent ruler?

49:55.308 --> 49:56.225
We have trained night and day

49:56.308 --> 49:57.433
Wait, Your Highness

49:57.516 --> 50:01.225
If you kill them, who will lead the navy?

50:01.266 --> 50:02.558
Halt!

50:10.975 --> 50:13.266
Ninety-three thousand eight hundred

50:13.350 --> 50:16.100
Ninety-four thousand

50:16.183 --> 50:18.183
Ninety-four thousand two hundred

50:18.266 --> 50:20.600
Ninety-four thousand six hundred

50:20.683 --> 50:23.558
We'll shoot Cao Cao with his own arrows

50:23.600 --> 50:25.600
This battle will be interesting

50:31.308 --> 50:32.350
Concentrate! No mistakes

50:32.433 --> 50:33.683
Wait

50:33.766 --> 50:35.808
Don't interrupt

50:35.891 --> 50:38.766
Two hundred per person
There'll be no mistakes

50:38.850 --> 50:41.183
Mr. Zhu-ge, what is this new invention?

50:41.266 --> 50:42.391
A rapid-fire crossbow

50:42.433 --> 50:44.433
It shoots ten arrows without reloading

50:44.516 --> 50:45.891
Here, watch

50:45.933 --> 50:47.850
Great

50:47.933 --> 50:49.433
Ninety-nine thousand four hundred

50:49.516 --> 50:51.183
Ninety-nine thousand six hundred

51:00.391 --> 51:01.475
Impressive!

51:01.558 --> 51:04.225
You know a trifle about weapon design too

51:04.308 --> 51:07.725
Knowing a trifle about everything
gives life more color

51:07.808 --> 51:10.350
Your Honor

51:10.433 --> 51:12.516
Did he reach one hundred thousand?

51:12.600 --> 51:16.475
The total is
ninety-nine thousand six hundred

51:17.933 --> 51:19.725
Now what?

51:20.683 --> 51:22.475
Well...

51:25.350 --> 51:27.725
Your Honor, it's only four hundred

51:27.808 --> 51:29.850
Short one is still short

51:29.933 --> 51:31.516
The law is firm as a mountain

51:31.600 --> 51:35.225
That's right. So what does the law say?

51:39.683 --> 51:41.391
The law prescribes beheading

51:42.850 --> 51:44.641
Garbages!

51:44.725 --> 51:46.183
What took you so long?

51:46.266 --> 51:47.641
Hurry and bring them over

51:47.725 --> 51:49.225
Thank god!

51:49.308 --> 51:50.683
The total is
one hundred thousand two hundred

51:50.766 --> 51:53.308
Mr. Zhu-ge has completed his mission

51:53.391 --> 51:56.350
Seems like my head is safe where it is

51:56.975 --> 51:58.725
How about yours?

52:01.891 --> 52:03.725
You want my head?

52:05.641 --> 52:07.808
Mr. Zhu-ge. We're just joking

52:07.891 --> 52:11.850
When I lost, was he joking?

52:11.933 --> 52:13.850
Of course not

52:37.891 --> 52:39.766
Looks like you haven't lost after all

52:39.850 --> 52:42.350
Cao Cao has executed
Admirals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun

52:50.975 --> 52:54.391
I think we've been duped

52:54.475 --> 52:57.641
Steal the enemy's weapons
then destroy their moral

52:57.725 --> 53:00.891
Your strategies
worked together brilliantly

53:03.391 --> 53:05.558
Cao Cao must be going crazy
right about now

53:05.600 --> 53:08.641
In two or three days,
he will try something desperate

53:08.725 --> 53:11.183
But this will not be good for Jiang Gan

53:14.266 --> 53:15.808
I've lost an old friend

53:18.975 --> 53:20.391
Honored guests

53:20.475 --> 53:22.891
Zhou Yu is just showing off his cleverness

53:22.933 --> 53:25.641
He undoubtedly thinks I have gone crazy

53:25.725 --> 53:27.683
Tell me, do I look crazy?

53:27.766 --> 53:30.725
Not at all...

53:30.766 --> 53:32.516
Come, let us root out the traitor

53:32.600 --> 53:34.891
then we can sleep easy. Cheers!

53:36.683 --> 53:39.183
Jiang Gan Yes

53:39.266 --> 53:42.391
Today you were of great service

53:42.433 --> 53:43.766
Please drink

53:50.725 --> 53:52.183
Thank you, Your Highness

54:03.641 --> 54:04.850
Sir!

54:10.766 --> 54:12.475
Sir! Are you...

54:16.808 --> 54:19.350
Your stupidity was trivial

54:19.433 --> 54:21.725
But you brought your stupidity upon me

54:26.766 --> 54:27.933
Hear this!

54:29.725 --> 54:32.558
In two days,
our army shall cross the river

54:32.600 --> 54:33.683
and take Red Cliff!

54:33.766 --> 54:34.891
Yes, Your Highness!

54:42.725 --> 54:47.225
All hear this!
In two days the army will cross the river

55:03.558 --> 55:04.891
What's going on here?

55:07.766 --> 55:09.891
There's a spy! Catch the spy!

55:16.766 --> 55:17.975
Halt!

55:24.641 --> 55:26.308
Don't let him escape!

55:27.766 --> 55:29.225
Grab him!

55:49.641 --> 55:52.141
Piggy, why do they want to hurt you?

55:52.225 --> 55:54.766
It's a misunderstanding
A misunderstanding?

55:55.266 --> 55:56.350
What's going on?

55:56.433 --> 55:57.558
He's a spy

55:57.641 --> 55:59.100
Nonsense, he is my friend

55:59.183 --> 56:01.350
Friend? Are you stupid?

56:02.683 --> 56:04.433
Come on, they're beating up the commander

56:04.516 --> 56:05.725
A fight!

56:33.308 --> 56:34.850
Pit

56:35.641 --> 56:36.975
Pit

56:41.683 --> 56:43.600
Piggy, are you all right?

56:48.933 --> 56:50.516
I have to go

56:56.433 --> 56:58.641
Piggy

56:58.725 --> 57:00.558
Where are you going?

57:00.600 --> 57:03.558
My mother is sick. I must go home

57:03.641 --> 57:06.766
That's very kind of you to visit her

57:12.266 --> 57:13.225
You should go home too

57:13.308 --> 57:15.516
No, I'll return after the war

57:15.600 --> 57:16.725
Fighting means no taxes

57:16.766 --> 57:18.725
That means more food on the table

57:18.766 --> 57:20.516
Hurry, go visit your mother

57:27.766 --> 57:29.558
I will come back to see you

57:37.475 --> 57:38.850
Ride high

57:51.600 --> 57:53.225
Don't let him escape!

57:53.308 --> 57:54.975
He's just going to see his mother

58:13.641 --> 58:14.766
In eighteen years of battle,

58:14.850 --> 58:17.266
I have never lost

58:17.350 --> 58:20.350
If I fail to capture this tiny cliff,

58:20.433 --> 58:22.725
I shudder to think
what historians will say

58:22.808 --> 58:23.975
Yes

58:29.600 --> 58:34.516
Your Highness

58:45.433 --> 58:46.641
How are things?

58:47.475 --> 58:49.725
Worse than expected

58:49.808 --> 58:53.350
The disease's spread has not slowed

58:54.683 --> 58:55.891
At this rate,

58:55.975 --> 58:58.725
it will take a month to control

59:01.766 --> 59:04.725
I respectfully request you
delay the assault

59:17.183 --> 59:18.891
Stop! Lie still

59:18.933 --> 59:21.266
Your Highness Sit up

59:21.350 --> 59:24.183
You are ill and must recuperate

59:27.225 --> 59:31.475
Man Tun, how can you be ill?

59:31.558 --> 59:33.475
You were always in perfect health

59:34.683 --> 59:36.308
What is on your mind?

59:37.475 --> 59:39.308
Go ahead

59:39.391 --> 59:40.933
I want to go home

59:43.891 --> 59:45.683
I too have not been home for a long time

59:47.225 --> 59:49.516
I want to see my youngest son

59:53.891 --> 59:55.725
He is only thirteen

59:57.891 --> 01:00:01.558
Younger than you even

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.141
He is kind-hearted and bright

01:00:05.225 --> 01:00:10.683
He has been frail since birth
and is often sick

01:00:10.766 --> 01:00:13.100
Yet in front of me,

01:00:13.183 --> 01:00:15.725
he pretends everything is fine

01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:22.225
Whatever the illness, he endures

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:23.933
He never complains to me

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:50.558
I swore at the start of this war

01:00:50.641 --> 01:00:54.683
to cleanse the world of warlords

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.391
We must seize Red Cliff
and storm the capital

01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:13.391
Then bring the mud of this land back home

01:01:13.433 --> 01:01:17.225
and tell our families we were victorious

01:01:19.558 --> 01:01:21.308
We were victorious!

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.600
So you all must be strong

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.933
as must I

01:01:35.433 --> 01:01:40.683
because I must bring you back home

01:02:25.225 --> 01:03:21.975
Victory...

01:03:42.308 --> 01:03:44.308
Greetings everyone

01:03:44.391 --> 01:03:45.350
Sorry for the wait

01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:46.725
We're glad you're back safe

01:03:47.808 --> 01:03:49.516
Did you have any problems?

01:03:49.558 --> 01:03:51.641
No. I just fell into the mud

01:03:51.725 --> 01:03:53.391
jumping the stockade

01:03:54.433 --> 01:03:55.975
Shang Xiang

01:03:57.183 --> 01:03:58.516
You're always causing trouble

01:03:58.558 --> 01:04:00.516
Where have you been?

01:04:04.933 --> 01:04:06.975
They are ready to attack

01:04:07.766 --> 01:04:09.308
Shang Xiang

01:04:10.308 --> 01:04:11.391
You're back

01:04:11.475 --> 01:04:13.391
Xiao Qiao

01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:18.558
Shang Xiang?

01:04:31.183 --> 01:04:32.641
Xiao Qiao

01:04:32.725 --> 01:04:35.558
please help me pull this
Go ahead, pull it

01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:07.725
This is a map of Cao Cao's camp

01:05:07.808 --> 01:05:09.433
This tower here

01:05:09.516 --> 01:05:11.308
is Cao Cao's headquarters

01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:13.641
Their best troops guard it

01:05:13.725 --> 01:05:15.141
The barracks are here

01:05:15.225 --> 01:05:17.100
East and west are well-defended

01:05:17.183 --> 01:05:18.808
The rear hill is weakest

01:05:18.891 --> 01:05:21.266
It's like a tiger that stares ahead

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.600
but forgets its tail

01:05:22.683 --> 01:05:23.850
The navy is here Put this on

01:05:23.933 --> 01:05:24.891
You'll catch a chill I'm not cold

01:05:24.975 --> 01:05:26.391
A third of their forces

01:05:26.475 --> 01:05:28.558
are onboard ready for assault

01:05:28.641 --> 01:05:30.766
Warships lead the smaller boats

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.725
Transport ships are in the middle

01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:34.350
This is an interlocked naval formation

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:35.558
I'm fine

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.725
Every ship is ready for attack or defense

01:05:56.975 --> 01:05:58.891
I was wrong to scold you

01:06:07.808 --> 01:06:09.350
If you were Zhou Yu,

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:12.183
how would you attack?

01:06:13.016 --> 01:06:15.183
He only has enough men for one assault

01:06:15.266 --> 01:06:18.183
an all-out attack on our fleet

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:21.183
They will want to attack with fire

01:06:21.266 --> 01:06:23.391
Fire? I doubt it

01:06:23.475 --> 01:06:26.183
Without manpower, they need strength

01:06:26.266 --> 01:06:29.266
Where can they get it? Fire of course

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.350
This is a standard rule of war

01:06:31.433 --> 01:06:33.891
Too bad it won't work

01:06:33.975 --> 01:06:37.183
A northwest wind is blowing

01:06:37.266 --> 01:06:40.475
If they attack our fleet with fire,

01:06:40.558 --> 01:06:45.891
they will be fighting the wind
and burn themselves

01:06:45.933 --> 01:06:49.016
We are the ones who should use fire

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.975
Yes, load the ships with brimstone

01:06:53.058 --> 01:06:56.475
Tomorrow, we shall burn
Red Cliff to the ground!

01:07:04.016 --> 01:07:05.933
The map shows

01:07:06.016 --> 01:07:08.391
Cao Cao's army has finished deployment

01:07:08.475 --> 01:07:13.433
Tonight may be the decisive battle

01:07:13.516 --> 01:07:16.225
This is a fight to the death

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:20.641
Win or lose, we must fight
with everything we have

01:07:34.641 --> 01:07:36.058
Shang Xiang

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.100
What are these lines between the ships?

01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:39.558
It sounds funny

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.600
They've locked their boats together

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:44.391
to stabilize the fleet

01:07:44.433 --> 01:07:47.558
so the Northerners won't get seasick

01:07:47.641 --> 01:07:51.016
Enough talk. What is your strategy?

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.433
Cao Cao made camp in a bad location

01:08:01.516 --> 01:08:03.100
It is hook-shaped

01:08:03.183 --> 01:08:05.183
This makes return difficult

01:08:05.266 --> 01:08:09.558
If their assault fails,
they cannot fall back

01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:11.433
We should use fire

01:08:11.516 --> 01:08:13.683
The terrain is in our favor

01:08:13.766 --> 01:08:16.890
If we can burn the fleet's vanguard,

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:19.433
they will be trapped and vulnerable

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:22.015
Yes, a fire attack!

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.600
Just give me ten fire ships

01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:28.975
Two will hit their left and right flanks

01:08:29.058 --> 01:08:33.433
The remaining eight will ram the center

01:08:33.515 --> 01:08:34.933
We'll burn an opening here!

01:08:35.015 --> 01:08:38.015
Next, you follow closely and rush in

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.350
No matter how great their numbers,

01:08:41.433 --> 01:08:43.475
we will crush them

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.350
If only we still had Liu Bei's cavalry,

01:08:51.433 --> 01:08:54.308
then we could attack
their camp at the rear

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:57.100
Then victory would be assured

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.015
This wind is to Cao Cao's advantage

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.350
A northwest wind is blowing

01:09:17.433 --> 01:09:19.890
Sailing into the wind
will burn our own fleet

01:09:19.933 --> 01:09:22.140
Cao Cao knows the wind is on his side

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.225
He will also think of using fire

01:09:53.015 --> 01:09:54.516
Why are you so quiet?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.183
What are you looking at?

01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:59.891
Look, those dark clouds in the east

01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:02.891
are enshrouding the sun

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:05.975
Isn't that rather unusual?

01:10:06.058 --> 01:10:08.391
Zhu-ge Liang, what does that mean?

01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:11.016
The winds will change

01:10:14.016 --> 01:10:15.516
I know from farming

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.558
If during a warm winter clouds
enshroud the sun,

01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:22.266
then along the Yangtze River

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.641
an unseasonal wind will blow

01:10:23.725 --> 01:10:25.475
What do you mean unseasonal?

01:10:25.558 --> 01:10:27.350
A warm southeast wind

01:10:27.433 --> 01:10:30.558
It blows from southeast to northwest

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.558
What if Cao Cao knows this too?

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.683
Only Admiral Cai Mao
would know and he is dead

01:10:43.975 --> 01:10:45.350
Zhu-ge Liang

01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:47.225
Can you predict when it will change?

01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:49.433
Tonight or tomorrow morning

01:10:49.516 --> 01:10:52.641
History shows the timing of weather is key

01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:54.475
He who can predict it will win

01:11:01.266 --> 01:11:04.600
We must delay his attack

01:11:04.683 --> 01:11:06.975
Only then will we have a chance at victory

01:11:31.433 --> 01:11:33.266
Greetings, General

01:11:40.058 --> 01:11:42.975
Terrific, just terrific
This fish oil is perfect!

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.391
Bigger Yes, General!

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.058
No good. Bigger!

01:12:27.141 --> 01:12:28.433
Yes, General

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.391
No good. Bigger!

01:12:40.433 --> 01:12:42.058
Just how big do you want it?

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.225
Go

01:13:01.433 --> 01:13:03.058
That's about right

01:13:05.266 --> 01:13:07.350
Yes! This is it!

01:13:18.433 --> 01:13:21.391
See how strong this northwest wind is?

01:13:21.475 --> 01:13:23.266
It will never shift

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:25.725
We'll never get near their navy

01:13:27.183 --> 01:13:29.975
Your Honor, I can fake a defection

01:13:30.058 --> 01:13:31.516
Invent some excuse

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.391
to punish me with fifty lashes

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.475
I'll fake a surrender in anger

01:13:35.558 --> 01:13:38.600
That way Cao Cao is sure to believe me

01:13:38.683 --> 01:13:42.558
Then I can sail my fire ships in range

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.975
How can you fight after such a beating?

01:13:47.266 --> 01:13:49.641
I could never treat a general that way

01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:52.641
Do not lose heart

01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:54.058
The east wind will come

01:13:54.141 --> 01:13:55.558
Your Honor...

01:13:55.641 --> 01:13:57.558
Terrible news...

01:13:57.641 --> 01:14:00.433
Our Lady has disappeared!

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.516
My dear husband,
by the time you read this,

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.391
I will be on the way to Cao Cao's camp

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.391
I will be cautious

01:14:35.433 --> 01:14:38.100
and only act when the moment is right

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:43.391
Yet I hope the east wind will come early

01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:47.016
Where there is faith, there is hope

01:14:51.683 --> 01:14:54.058
The clear waters of the Yangtze

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.933
the emerald leaves of the mountains

01:14:57.016 --> 01:14:59.475
the birds returning to nest

01:14:59.558 --> 01:15:01.725
the fisherman singing his evening song

01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:06.183
This is our home,

01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:08.350
our beautiful native land

01:15:09.933 --> 01:15:12.641
Our people gladly give
their lives for her sake

01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:16.641
I cannot stand idly by

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.358
I have been carrying our child
Ping An for three months

01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:46.525
I did not tell you

01:15:47.483 --> 01:15:49.191
fearing it might distract you

01:15:50.983 --> 01:15:56.316
We cannot in caring for our child

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.525
and forget the children of the Southlands

01:16:00.275 --> 01:16:03.400
I want to see them grow up together

01:16:03.483 --> 01:16:07.566
to have a future where they can play,

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.358
swim, pick flowers

01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:13.358
and plant rice in peace

01:16:13.441 --> 01:16:16.816
(Your child Ping An)

01:16:16.858 --> 01:16:20.650
(Pregnant)

01:16:21.566 --> 01:16:25.108
Do not fear

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:27.650
I shall bring Ping An home

01:17:06.108 --> 01:17:09.316
Some traditions still carry great meaning

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:12.483
For example, rice flour and sugar

01:17:12.566 --> 01:17:16.650
stick together like a family at reunion

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:27.816
Over here! Bring the cart here!

01:17:27.858 --> 01:17:30.608
There are sweet rice
dumplings for everyone

01:17:31.525 --> 01:17:34.191
Today is winter solstice,
a time for reunion

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.150
Everyone have some rice dumplings

01:17:37.316 --> 01:17:40.150
Two or three per person! Eat up!

01:17:42.566 --> 01:17:44.275
Officers and soldiers alike, come on

01:17:44.316 --> 01:17:47.191
Two or three per person! Eat up!

01:17:47.275 --> 01:17:49.025
Come on...

01:17:50.025 --> 01:17:51.441
Give me a bowl

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.400
Zhang Fei, you're making them too big

01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:11.941
Do you want us to choke?

01:18:11.983 --> 01:18:14.608
Fine with me. I couldn't be happier

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.566
Zhao Yun

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:26.483
Has your wound healed
from combat practice?

01:19:26.525 --> 01:19:30.566
So long as I can fight,
a wound means nothing

01:19:44.941 --> 01:19:49.108
Guan Yu, how many times
have you read the classics?

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:52.275
If a man of learning does not
understand brotherhood,

01:19:52.358 --> 01:19:54.150
isn't his learning worthless?

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:20.566
My Lord, what are we doing here?

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:21.983
Waiting

01:20:23.316 --> 01:20:25.191
Waiting for what?

01:20:25.275 --> 01:20:27.275
Waiting for Zhu-ge Liang

01:20:27.316 --> 01:20:31.275
Waiting for his return, so we can go home

01:20:31.316 --> 01:20:32.941
Do we still have a home?

01:20:34.233 --> 01:20:37.900
Sons of the Southlands, listen

01:20:37.983 --> 01:20:40.775
Today is the winter solstice,

01:20:40.816 --> 01:20:44.316
a day for family reunion

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.983
Yet thieves encircle our home

01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:52.108
How can we celebrate like this?

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:56.191
I say let us drive them from this land

01:20:56.275 --> 01:20:59.108
Then we shall have
our celebratory family meal

01:20:59.150 --> 01:21:02.150
Here!

01:21:05.816 --> 01:21:07.233
My Lord

01:21:07.316 --> 01:21:09.066
Though I sometimes disagree with you,

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:13.150
I have never said a word against you

01:21:13.233 --> 01:21:17.858
But this is a choice
between right and wrong

01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:19.858
I acted for the good of us all

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:22.983
yet you lecture me for being unrighteous

01:21:23.066 --> 01:21:26.066
You have followed me so long and for what?

01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:28.233
I just want to ensure we live on

01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:55.900
There are some things I value
more than my life

01:22:59.525 --> 01:23:04.775
Zhou Yu, may your plans come to fruition

01:23:04.816 --> 01:23:07.025
We will fight the good fight

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:31.483
Zhou Yu's wife is here

01:23:31.525 --> 01:23:33.358
She came alone

01:25:31.108 --> 01:25:33.025
Zhou Yu,

01:25:33.108 --> 01:25:36.275
we must alter our plan of attack

01:25:36.316 --> 01:25:38.191
Consider your wife's safety,

01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:39.983
I will send our best men

01:25:40.066 --> 01:25:42.983
around back to rescue her

01:25:43.066 --> 01:25:45.233
No changes

01:25:45.316 --> 01:25:48.941
All our forces must be
focused on frontal assault

01:25:49.025 --> 01:25:50.608
We cannot divide our strength

01:25:52.025 --> 01:25:55.525
Your Honor, we stand
alone on the battlefield

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:57.275
Without allied support,

01:25:57.316 --> 01:26:00.816
the chance for victory seems slight

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.316
I have never given up on my dream

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.025
Victory cannot rest on dreams alone

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.900
When will the east wind come?

01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:16.900
Based on new observations,

01:26:16.983 --> 01:26:18.441
at around one o'clock

01:26:18.525 --> 01:26:21.108
If at that time you
still trust your friends,

01:26:21.191 --> 01:26:23.275
light a lantern for a signal

01:26:28.066 --> 01:26:30.941
If misfortune befalls Xiao Qiao,

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:33.316
will you still fight a war of honor?

01:26:51.358 --> 01:26:54.233
I saw you once in the back
of your family's estate

01:26:54.316 --> 01:26:58.941
Though young, you were
already a great beauty

01:26:59.025 --> 01:27:00.775
You were studying the tea ceremony

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:03.441
and liked catching butterflies

01:27:22.358 --> 01:27:25.150
Did you launch this war for me?

01:27:25.233 --> 01:27:27.150
You believe that?

01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:31.275
My father was very fond of you

01:27:31.316 --> 01:27:34.483
At that time, Cao Cao
believed in justice, ideals

01:27:34.566 --> 01:27:36.483
and loyalty to the Han throne

01:27:36.566 --> 01:27:38.816
He was a young hero

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:45.525
How else could he have
become Prime Minister?

01:27:45.608 --> 01:27:48.900
By killing many people

01:27:53.608 --> 01:27:57.483
I heard many Southland soldiers
have fallen ill

01:27:57.525 --> 01:27:59.566
Yes

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:01.900
I heard Liu Bei has fled

01:28:01.983 --> 01:28:04.566
and the alliance is broken

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:06.983
Yes

01:28:07.066 --> 01:28:10.983
Then Zhou Yu must be a Ionely man

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.066
Did he send you?

01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:21.983
This was my idea

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:27.483
Why are you here?

01:28:27.525 --> 01:28:29.358
Please withdraw your troops

01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:32.941
Victory is yours

01:28:32.983 --> 01:28:34.900
What need is there to fight on?

01:28:34.983 --> 01:28:36.816
No

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.650
Zhou Yu shall kneel before me in surrender

01:28:45.066 --> 01:28:46.983
What is this?

01:28:49.358 --> 01:28:51.525
I am not here for my husband

01:28:51.608 --> 01:28:54.275
but for the people of this kingdom

01:28:54.316 --> 01:28:58.525
Please end this war

01:28:58.608 --> 01:29:01.108
And if I refuse?

01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:10.566
Stop playing

01:29:17.441 --> 01:29:21.108
You must witness how I defeat Zhou Yu

01:30:04.108 --> 01:30:05.483
What's on your mind?

01:30:09.316 --> 01:30:11.441
Just thinking of a silly friend

01:30:27.566 --> 01:30:30.983
The times make the hero

01:31:02.066 --> 01:31:04.941
After this battle,

01:31:04.983 --> 01:31:06.525
I will have time to savor your tea

01:31:06.608 --> 01:31:09.275
Just one cup?

01:31:09.316 --> 01:31:10.983
It'll help you relax

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:17.233
Fine

01:31:21.858 --> 01:31:25.233
No one's ever given us respect

01:31:25.316 --> 01:31:27.150
So what?

01:31:27.191 --> 01:31:29.150
Who cares so long as we respect ourselves?

01:31:29.191 --> 01:31:30.775
Listen up!

01:31:30.858 --> 01:31:35.858
Our boats will soon charge Cao Cao's fleet

01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:39.941
No man jumps ship until their ships burn

01:31:39.983 --> 01:31:41.775
Yes, sir!

01:31:41.816 --> 01:31:43.025
Any problem with that?

01:31:43.108 --> 01:31:44.525
No, sir!

01:31:44.608 --> 01:31:46.275
That's what I thought

01:31:46.316 --> 01:31:49.483
Have you all written to your families?

01:31:49.566 --> 01:31:51.358
Yes

01:32:25.983 --> 01:32:27.025
Don't rush

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:29.941
Appreciate the tea's color and bouquet

01:32:29.983 --> 01:32:31.233
Oh

01:32:54.941 --> 01:32:56.441
Why is the Prime Minister
waiting to attack?

01:32:56.483 --> 01:32:57.816
The wind is behaving strangely

01:32:57.858 --> 01:32:59.941
I know

01:33:00.025 --> 01:33:01.775
He is drinking tea with that woman

01:33:01.816 --> 01:33:03.150
Tea?

01:33:05.108 --> 01:33:07.983
What makes brewing tea so difficult?

01:33:08.066 --> 01:33:12.900
Leaves, heat, water, and utensils

01:33:12.983 --> 01:33:14.816
All demand study

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.441
Yet the hardest is boiling water

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:24.191
Boiling water?

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.650
Look!

01:33:29.108 --> 01:33:30.525
The wind has stopped

01:33:41.483 --> 01:33:44.941
At first boil, bubbles hiss
and resemble tiny fish eyes

01:33:45.025 --> 01:33:49.233
At second boil,
the edge simmers like a fountain

01:33:49.316 --> 01:33:51.941
This is when tea is finest

01:33:52.025 --> 01:33:54.816
At third boil,
the water seethes and spurts

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.816
Any further and the water
is past its prime

01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:03.566
Your Honor, the wind seems about to shift

01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:06.150
It's time to attack
What are we waiting for?

01:34:06.233 --> 01:34:07.525
Our allies

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:09.400
What allies?

01:34:14.608 --> 01:34:16.108
Liu Bei fled days ago

01:34:16.191 --> 01:34:18.525
This is all part of Zhou Yu's plan

01:34:18.608 --> 01:34:21.275
Some plans are best kept quiet

01:34:26.025 --> 01:34:27.316
Enough! It is full!

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.316
Your Highness

01:34:29.358 --> 01:34:33.233
Don't you see your true self
reflected in this tea?

01:34:33.316 --> 01:34:36.108
Your heart is overflowing with ambition

01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:41.566
It's too full to let other people in

01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.816
You've carried this
full heart to Red Cliff

01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:48.483
Someone here shall pour
that heart onto the floor

01:35:07.608 --> 01:35:09.566
Your Highness

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.025
You do not understand the art of tea

01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:22.858
Your Honor, tell us what we must do

01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:24.066
At two o'clock,

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:27.275
the ten fire ships
will ram Cao Cao's fleet

01:35:27.316 --> 01:35:29.025
burning through their vanguard

01:35:31.275 --> 01:35:32.400
With the fleet broken,

01:35:32.483 --> 01:35:35.275
Zhao Yun will hit the east gate

01:35:35.316 --> 01:35:37.400
to divert their attention

01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:42.858
Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei

01:35:42.941 --> 01:35:45.400
will overwhelm Cao Cao's camp
from the west gate

01:35:58.483 --> 01:35:59.941
Doctor!

01:36:02.233 --> 01:36:03.358
Your Highness

01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:05.400
Call Doctor Hua Tuo. My head aches

01:36:05.483 --> 01:36:09.525
Your Highness, Hua Tuo has left

01:36:09.608 --> 01:36:13.108
What did you say? Hua Tuo is gone

01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:20.858
Cast off!

01:37:32.150 --> 01:37:33.150
What is this wind?

01:37:33.233 --> 01:37:34.900
It's an easterly wind, Your Highness

01:37:34.983 --> 01:37:37.358
It shifted? Impossible!

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:44.858
Enemy ships approaching!

01:37:45.525 --> 01:37:47.400
General, enemy ships approaching!

01:37:47.483 --> 01:37:48.566
Hurry, separate the ships!

01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:50.108
Separate ships!

01:38:01.816 --> 01:38:02.900
What is that?

01:38:02.983 --> 01:38:05.233
That is their lanterns, Your Highness

01:38:08.316 --> 01:38:09.608
Forward

01:38:16.525 --> 01:38:20.150
Zhou Yu. I have done all I can

01:38:20.233 --> 01:38:22.608
Tonight will decide the fate of the empire

01:38:28.108 --> 01:38:29.775
There must be no mistakes

01:38:29.816 --> 01:38:31.441
Zhu-ge Liang,

01:38:31.525 --> 01:38:33.900
you weren't lying after all!

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.316
Report!

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.983
Boats are approaching fast

01:38:44.066 --> 01:38:44.983
Separate ships immediately

01:38:45.066 --> 01:38:46.566
Separation has already begun

01:38:59.525 --> 01:39:01.608
Light the fires!

01:39:08.816 --> 01:39:10.233
Forward

01:39:19.941 --> 01:39:22.066
Hurry over here!

01:39:47.566 --> 01:39:49.275
All speed ahead!

01:40:35.983 --> 01:40:37.275
Hurry, separate the ships

01:40:39.275 --> 01:40:40.816
Faster

01:41:40.275 --> 01:41:42.858
Retreat! Protect the main gate!

01:41:43.941 --> 01:41:49.650
Faster, toward Cao Cao's flagship!

01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:38.608
Strike as powerful as thunder

01:44:14.941 --> 01:44:16.275
Charge!

01:44:17.941 --> 01:44:20.233
Go ahead. Charge!

01:44:41.566 --> 01:44:43.108
Follow me

01:45:05.608 --> 01:45:07.316
Shoot!

01:45:20.608 --> 01:45:22.150
Launch catapults!

01:45:38.066 --> 01:45:39.816
Hurry, the enemy is approaching

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.525
Look, over there

01:46:03.483 --> 01:46:05.400
Your Highness! Terrible news!

01:46:05.483 --> 01:46:06.941
They have broken through the stockade!

01:46:06.983 --> 01:46:08.483
Why are you panicking?

01:46:10.025 --> 01:46:12.108
Do not forget you are a general

01:46:12.191 --> 01:46:13.650
I...

01:47:21.983 --> 01:47:23.275
Try to endure the pain

01:47:40.150 --> 01:47:42.108
Reinforce Zhang Fei! Move!

01:48:06.233 --> 01:48:09.941
Your Highness, the rear gate
is under surprise attack

01:48:10.025 --> 01:48:11.941
It is Liu Bei's allied forces

01:48:12.983 --> 01:48:14.608
Liu Bei?

01:48:16.025 --> 01:48:17.858
Free the horses!

01:48:17.941 --> 01:48:19.275
Pull!

01:48:32.483 --> 01:48:33.816
Shoot!

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.441
General Gan,

01:48:36.525 --> 01:48:38.858
we must save energy for inside

01:48:42.316 --> 01:48:43.483
You must break down this gate

01:48:43.566 --> 01:48:45.108
so we can join our allies

01:48:45.150 --> 01:48:46.275
otherwise all is lost

01:48:46.358 --> 01:48:48.358
No problem Good luck

01:49:19.941 --> 01:49:21.233
Halt

01:49:24.316 --> 01:49:25.983
Tear down the barricade!

01:49:29.441 --> 01:49:30.941
Shoot!

01:49:52.191 --> 01:49:53.441
Forward

01:49:53.525 --> 01:49:55.316
Attack the main gate

01:50:12.441 --> 01:50:13.816
Come on soldier

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.566
Hang in there

01:50:27.066 --> 01:50:28.108
General Gan!

01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:29.983
Individual bombs aren't strong enough

01:50:31.983 --> 01:50:34.233
Run! The fire is coming!

01:50:34.316 --> 01:50:36.358
Give me all your fire bombs

01:50:36.441 --> 01:50:37.441
There's only three left

01:50:37.525 --> 01:50:40.816
No retreat! No surrender!

01:50:57.025 --> 01:50:59.108
This is it!

01:51:21.483 --> 01:51:23.316
All forces attack!

01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:32.358
Shoot!

01:53:50.483 --> 01:53:51.775
Your Highness

01:53:51.816 --> 01:53:53.316
The navy is lost

01:53:53.358 --> 01:53:56.400
East, south, and west...
all three sides have been sunk

01:54:04.941 --> 01:54:09.316
It seems like they went up in flames too

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.275
Yes, Your Highness

01:54:11.316 --> 01:54:13.316
All is quiet below

01:54:27.816 --> 01:54:29.358
The fire is too fierce!

01:54:29.441 --> 01:54:30.900
Stay together at all costs!

01:54:30.983 --> 01:54:32.441
Don't get separated!

01:54:41.566 --> 01:54:42.983
Your Highness

01:54:44.358 --> 01:54:46.400
Perhaps retreat is best

01:54:46.483 --> 01:54:48.150
Retreat?

01:54:48.233 --> 01:54:50.775
With our best soldiers still remaining?

01:54:50.816 --> 01:54:52.941
They would give their lives for me

01:54:56.025 --> 01:54:58.525
Even if all would die, they must fight

01:54:58.608 --> 01:55:00.441
This is military power

01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:09.483
All together! Charge!

01:55:20.191 --> 01:55:21.358
Fight me if you dare

01:55:21.441 --> 01:55:23.108
Come back here!

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.816
Come on, you traitor!

01:55:43.358 --> 01:55:44.858
General!

01:56:32.441 --> 01:56:34.525
Don't give up, my brother

01:56:34.608 --> 01:56:37.358
Guan Yu! Where is Liu Bei?

01:56:47.483 --> 01:56:49.191
All speed ahead!

01:57:03.358 --> 01:57:04.941
Break formation!

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.483
Launch spears!

01:58:14.316 --> 01:58:15.941
Forward!

01:58:15.983 --> 01:58:19.441
Crush them or die trying

01:58:30.858 --> 01:58:32.483
Hang in there

01:59:57.066 --> 02:00:03.816
I oversaw the end of every warlord

02:00:11.941 --> 02:00:17.108
I saw the end of one here and one there

02:00:33.608 --> 02:00:35.566
The end of all but here

02:00:54.316 --> 02:00:55.566
Just in time

02:00:55.650 --> 02:00:57.483
I knew you wouldn't let me down

02:00:57.566 --> 02:00:59.400
I said we would meet again

02:00:59.483 --> 02:01:01.358
Gan Xing sacrificed himself

02:01:02.983 --> 02:01:04.608
But not in vain

02:01:07.858 --> 02:01:09.400
The fire is approaching

02:01:09.483 --> 02:01:11.441
We must save Xiao Qiao now!

02:01:11.525 --> 02:01:13.233
First find Cao Cao

02:01:17.275 --> 02:01:20.150
We have lost

02:01:20.191 --> 02:01:22.816
all because of that accursed woman

02:01:24.150 --> 02:01:27.441
She ruined our chance to attack

02:01:27.483 --> 02:01:28.983
I'll kill her

02:01:29.066 --> 02:01:30.358
Kill her

02:01:50.983 --> 02:01:53.066
Come no further

02:02:27.816 --> 02:02:29.316
Don't let the enemy through

02:02:29.358 --> 02:02:31.566
That way, quickly...

02:02:37.316 --> 02:02:39.400
Protect the Prime Minister! Get them!

02:02:39.483 --> 02:02:41.150
Pit?

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.941
Pit

02:03:01.983 --> 02:03:03.358
It's me, Piggy

02:03:06.566 --> 02:03:08.983
It's me, Piggy

02:03:09.066 --> 02:03:10.858
Piggy?

02:03:43.566 --> 02:03:45.275
Piggy

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.316
You came to see me

02:03:53.816 --> 02:03:56.108
I said I would

02:03:56.150 --> 02:03:57.983
Piggy

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.233
Still want to play Ride High?

02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:23.816
I'll kill that witch

02:07:26.150 --> 02:07:27.358
Don't move

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.025
Zhou Yu

02:07:39.108 --> 02:07:40.483
Viceroy Zhou

02:07:40.566 --> 02:07:42.816
The traitor Cao Cao Silence!

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:45.108
You shall call me Prime Minister

02:07:47.358 --> 02:07:52.400
I never guessed I'd lose to a gust of wind

02:07:52.483 --> 02:07:54.483
Because you don't understand
the Will of Heaven

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:59.483
I never dreamed I'd be
defeated by a cup of tea

02:08:01.941 --> 02:08:05.025
For you, war was just a tea ceremony

02:08:05.108 --> 02:08:06.816
Such a pity

02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.525
You never knew what you were fighting for

02:08:08.608 --> 02:08:10.941
I come by order of the Emperor

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:13.983
to subdue rebels like you

02:08:15.316 --> 02:08:17.191
We are not rebelling against the Emperor

02:08:17.275 --> 02:08:19.525
but against you You pest

02:08:56.108 --> 02:08:57.858
Little boy

02:08:57.941 --> 02:09:00.150
This has been quite an enjoyable hunt

02:09:01.608 --> 02:09:03.441
What do you want to hunt?

02:09:03.483 --> 02:09:05.566
Tiger

02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:08.816
By the looks of you

02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:11.816
You are a far cry from your father

02:09:16.316 --> 02:09:17.858
Shoot!

02:09:27.483 --> 02:09:30.400
I am prime Minister of the Emperor's court

02:09:30.483 --> 02:09:33.941
Death is too good for rebels like you

02:09:33.983 --> 02:09:35.983
If you declare allegiance to me,

02:09:36.025 --> 02:09:38.358
I can pardon you

02:09:42.275 --> 02:09:44.483
Kneel down, all of you

02:09:48.983 --> 02:09:50.483
Your time is over

02:10:03.525 --> 02:10:05.275
Lay down your sword

02:10:16.233 --> 02:10:18.191
Your Highness, kill them!

02:10:18.275 --> 02:10:20.316
Kill them all

02:10:21.983 --> 02:10:24.275
Xiao Qiao!

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.316
Are you both safe?

02:10:26.358 --> 02:10:28.191
We are both fine

02:10:32.483 --> 02:10:34.316
We lost

02:10:34.358 --> 02:10:36.525
all because of you!

02:10:37.358 --> 02:10:39.900
Kneel down before me

02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:52.275
Kneel to me and I will spare Xiao Qiao

02:10:52.316 --> 02:10:53.775
We won't let you harm her

02:10:53.816 --> 02:10:55.566
"We"?

02:10:55.650 --> 02:10:58.275
You mean"them"?

02:10:58.316 --> 02:11:00.525
That motley troop?

02:11:00.608 --> 02:11:02.233
They are my friends

02:11:04.275 --> 02:11:06.025
War knows no friends

02:11:06.108 --> 02:11:09.525
Tomorrow, they shall be your enemies

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:15.941
General!

02:11:16.025 --> 02:11:18.358
Push her off! Die!

02:11:36.650 --> 02:11:38.150
Your Honor!

02:11:56.066 --> 02:11:57.483
Are you both all right?

02:12:17.316 --> 02:12:19.025
Let's go

02:12:20.983 --> 02:12:23.441
I promise I will take you home

02:13:14.275 --> 02:13:16.483
Go

02:13:16.566 --> 02:13:20.025
Go back to where you came from

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:48.941
There is no victor here

02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:39.017
Meng Meng

02:14:40.309 --> 02:14:43.100
Go on now, go

02:14:54.809 --> 02:14:56.434
Meng Meng

02:15:06.517 --> 02:15:09.392
From division comes unity,
and from unity, division

02:15:09.475 --> 02:15:11.975
Liu Bei won't stand being second best

02:15:12.059 --> 02:15:15.350
One day, we will face
each other on the battlefield

02:15:15.434 --> 02:15:19.225
No man can tell the future

02:15:19.309 --> 02:15:21.434
The world is full of heroes

02:15:21.517 --> 02:15:25.934
But you're the one I most fear offending

02:15:25.975 --> 02:15:27.600
You would be an opponent I truly fear

02:15:27.684 --> 02:15:29.059
Me?

02:15:29.142 --> 02:15:32.309
I'd best return home and get some sleep

02:15:32.392 --> 02:15:34.309
Are you a good farmer?

02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:36.350
I planted lotus flowers once

02:15:36.434 --> 02:15:38.517
but none lived long

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:41.350
Do not be humble
You have brought peace to the land

02:15:44.225 --> 02:15:48.059
In this alliance, I found true friends

02:15:48.142 --> 02:15:50.059
No matter what may happen,

02:15:50.142 --> 02:15:51.559
this experience is engraved in my heart

02:15:51.642 --> 02:15:54.100
I too will not forget

02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:02.100
Zhu-ge Liang,

02:16:02.184 --> 02:16:05.184
when Meng Meng has grown,
do not make her a war horse

02:16:05.267 --> 02:16:06.725
Don't worry

02:16:06.809 --> 02:16:09.309
These hands helped birth her

02:16:09.392 --> 02:16:11.392
I shall always cherish her
