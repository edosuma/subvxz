03:27.925 --> 03:30.426
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the man

03:30.511 --> 03:32.887
who knows
what you're going to do before you do it.

03:32.971 --> 03:35.681
The amazing Frank Cadillac!

03:40.395 --> 03:42.313
Here's to world peace.

03:49.738 --> 03:53.199
Good evening. Welcome to beautiful
downtown Las Vegas.

03:53.367 --> 03:57.078
How many people are here
from the Orient? Raise your hands.

03:57.663 --> 03:59.497
You, sir. Where are you from?

03:59.581 --> 04:01.374
No, wait! Wait. Don't tell me.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.502
I'm sensing you must have soul.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.171
You're a Seoul man.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.882
Why don't you
share with everyone where you're from?

04:09.967 --> 04:12.051
- Korea.
- How about that, folks?

04:12.344 --> 04:16.180
And may I assume that this
charming young lady is your daughter?

04:16.723 --> 04:19.392
- She's my wife!
- Well, of course she is!

04:19.476 --> 04:22.562
And what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.605
- What's your name?
- Yong Kyunge.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.023
Yong Kyunge.

04:26.108 --> 04:28.901
Would you be kind enough
to join me up on stage, please?

04:28.986 --> 04:31.863
Are you serious
about this guy? This a joke?

04:33.115 --> 04:35.533
Want me to round up some
mimes and clowns while we're at it?

04:35.617 --> 04:37.702
Yong Kyunge, what if I told you

04:37.786 --> 04:40.288
that that pretty necklace
you're wearing has a broken catch,

04:40.372 --> 04:43.040
and on my count of three,
will fall into your drink?

04:43.125 --> 04:45.668
Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that just blow your mind?

04:45.752 --> 04:46.836
- Yeah.
- Yes!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.963
Wouldn't it blow all your minds?

04:49.172 --> 04:51.841
Three, two, one, now.

04:54.219 --> 04:55.970
Did somebody say "spooky"?

04:56.680 --> 04:59.473
Wait a minute.
Look at your glass. Where'd it go?

05:00.309 --> 05:03.060
Yong Kyunge, why don't you
look inside my pocket?

05:03.145 --> 05:04.937
Reach in. Dig deep.

05:06.148 --> 05:08.774
Let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.820
That's magic, folks,
and that's why I'm here.

05:16.158 --> 05:18.576
You've probably seen
a lot of those shows.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.662
Mentalists. Magicians. Illusionists.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.832
You'd be shocked to know
that sometimes,

05:24.958 --> 05:27.418
not often, but sometimes,

05:27.711 --> 05:29.378
it's the real deal.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.505
Masquerading as an act.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.425
Hiding behind a few $50 tricks.

05:34.509 --> 05:36.218
Hiding in plain sight.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.513
Because if the magician doesn't do that,

05:39.598 --> 05:43.059
the alternative is impossible
for others to live with.

05:43.852 --> 05:47.605
Anyway, Wednesday night
at the Back Page doesn't pay very well,

05:47.689 --> 05:48.898
so I gamble.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.860
But I don't play against other people.
Only against the house.

05:56.365 --> 06:00.368
So, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.

06:01.036 --> 06:03.120
The idea is to go unnoticed.

06:03.205 --> 06:05.665
That way, I can keep coming back.

06:08.043 --> 06:09.543
I'm not a god.

06:09.628 --> 06:11.837
I can't see everyone's future.

06:11.922 --> 06:13.381
Only my own.

06:13.465 --> 06:15.591
And only within two minutes.

06:15.926 --> 06:17.843
Except for when I saw her.

06:17.928 --> 06:19.720
But we'll come back to that.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.014
There's no pattern
to this guy. He's all over the map.

06:22.099 --> 06:25.434
Well, he's not counting.
Not off the top of a five-deck shoe.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.061
Wait a minute.

06:27.312 --> 06:30.106
Isn't that that two-bit magic act
over at the Back Page?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.274
- What's his name?
- Cadillac.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.319
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.

06:35.404 --> 06:37.822
Is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal?

06:37.906 --> 06:39.949
You can't trick the deck.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.827
I'm telling you,
that little prick knows what's coming.

06:42.911 --> 06:45.121
If he's running that good a system,
why is he not betting more?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.498
That's going to be my second question.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.085
Look at that. He's looking right at us.

06:51.169 --> 06:53.170
It's like he can hear us.

06:53.255 --> 06:55.339
- What table was that?
- 27.

06:55.841 --> 06:58.509
This is Roybal. Give me two men
on table 27. I'm coming right down.

06:58.593 --> 07:00.553
Place your bets, please.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.389
Here's the thing about the future.

07:03.473 --> 07:05.141
Every time you look at it,

07:05.225 --> 07:07.893
it changes because you looked at it.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.605
- Hi.
- And that changes everything else.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.817
$9,070.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.779
Empty the drawer. Move!

07:20.198 --> 07:21.615
Drop the gun! Now!

07:29.666 --> 07:32.626
$9,070.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.009
Drop the gun! Step back!

07:40.469 --> 07:43.012
It's his gun.
He was going to shoot two people!

07:43.096 --> 07:45.473
Step back. We'll settle this right now.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.308
What's he doing?

07:48.101 --> 07:52.313
Secure the doors, elevators, escalators,
every way out of this damn place! Now!

07:52.397 --> 07:56.650
Freeman, seal off the blackjack tables.
Sullivan, link up with Roybal.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.789
We're on the floor.
On the floor right now.

08:09.873 --> 08:11.749
Bring up the other cameras.

08:15.754 --> 08:17.505
That way. This way.

08:32.770 --> 08:35.688
He's right next to you.
$10 slots, aisle 14.

08:50.956 --> 08:54.583
There he is!
Behind you! Your left! Turn around!

08:54.668 --> 08:56.293
He's right between you!

09:02.050 --> 09:05.594
He's in the men's room
near the gift shop. Gift shop! Gift shop!

09:33.999 --> 09:36.125
Davis, where the hell is he?

09:38.003 --> 09:40.462
Black T-shirt, straw hat!
Heading towards the entrance!

09:40.547 --> 09:42.214
Come on, let's go.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.693
Call Vegas P.D.

10:02.777 --> 10:05.487
Just stole a silver Charger, tag 585G4S.

11:50.385 --> 11:51.969
Drop the gun! Step back.

11:52.053 --> 11:55.347
He rose to the top of our gambling fraud
wish list about two months ago.

11:55.432 --> 11:58.642
What he does has nothing
to do with luck. It's definable ability.

11:58.727 --> 12:01.145
Look at him. He knows exactly
what to do and not be caught.

12:01.229 --> 12:03.355
Can you explain that to me?

12:03.440 --> 12:06.525
No, I can't explain it,
Callie, nor do I have the time.

12:06.651 --> 12:09.862
The Russian Federation has a
10-kiloton nuclear munition

12:09.946 --> 12:11.905
- unaccounted for.
- I understand that.

12:11.990 --> 12:16.076
I'm not sure you do. We need
every agent available beating the street.

12:16.202 --> 12:20.164
That bomb was stolen five weeks ago.
We've just been informed of it now.

12:20.332 --> 12:23.167
Which means it could be
parked under this truck for all we know.

12:23.251 --> 12:25.336
I need actionable intelligence,

12:25.420 --> 12:28.213
not paranormals and bullshit magicians.

12:28.298 --> 12:29.673
With all due respect, sir,

12:29.758 --> 12:32.092
this bullshit magician's
shown a pattern of advanced awareness

12:32.177 --> 12:33.677
that is statistically impossible.

12:33.762 --> 12:37.139
You let me bring him in
and you'll get what you want.

12:38.933 --> 12:41.143
Five days, Callie. That's it.

12:45.315 --> 12:47.483
Get me the head of casino security.

12:52.947 --> 12:54.656
- You Roybal?
- It's Roybal.

12:54.741 --> 12:55.866
Whatever.

12:55.950 --> 12:58.660
- Who are you?
- Cavanaugh. Take a walk.

13:01.289 --> 13:04.583
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest.
Come on.

13:16.304 --> 13:18.931
- What'd you do? You got a new car?
- Stole it.

13:20.058 --> 13:21.642
Look at this.

13:22.143 --> 13:24.686
Twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.273
Well, that's what you get
from two packs a day.

13:28.358 --> 13:29.691
Oh, hey.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.363
- I got you two sandwiches.
- Two sandwiches?

13:35.073 --> 13:37.491
- That's 20 grand.
- Take it. I love you.

13:37.575 --> 13:38.992
Oh, jeez.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.036
How can I repay you?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.542
Must be a bitch to park this thing.

13:49.879 --> 13:52.548
Chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.174
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh
has explained to you

13:54.259 --> 13:55.717
that everything you say
is admissible in court

13:55.802 --> 13:58.262
and anything you knowingly admit
can be used against you.

13:58.346 --> 14:00.514
Do we understand each other?

14:00.598 --> 14:01.598
Sure.

14:01.683 --> 14:04.101
- Tell me about Cris Johnson.
- I don't know who that is.

14:04.185 --> 14:05.436
How about Frank Cadillac?

14:05.520 --> 14:06.937
You chased him
out of your casino tonight.

14:07.021 --> 14:09.773
- He stole a car from valet parking.
- Yeah, I know Cadillac.

14:09.858 --> 14:11.191
I thought he was cheating us at cards.

14:11.276 --> 14:13.110
Next thing I know, he's tackling
some guy and waving a gun.

14:13.194 --> 14:14.278
The gun wasn't his.

14:14.362 --> 14:17.156
The man he tackled is wanted
for two casino killings in Reno.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.907
He's in custody now.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.243
Come on,
I want to show you something.

14:22.245 --> 14:23.954
You remember this?

14:25.623 --> 14:28.417
Oh, yeah, of course I do.
We were saying he's looking right at us.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.086
- How'd you get this?
- Think carefully.

14:31.254 --> 14:33.464
What were you talking about
right when he looked up?

14:33.548 --> 14:35.632
We were saying, if he has a system,
why isn't he betting more?

14:35.717 --> 14:37.968
You sure you weren't doing
or saying anything else?

14:38.052 --> 14:40.095
I was going down to pick him up,
I was reaching for my radio...

14:40.180 --> 14:42.556
And right then? That's when
he looked up? Be very specific.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.099
That's what I said.

14:44.392 --> 14:45.893
He looked up, really.

14:48.062 --> 14:49.563
So he doesn't have to be there to do it.

14:49.647 --> 14:52.357
Once you enter
his consciousness, he can pick it up.

14:52.442 --> 14:54.234
Is that to work his system?

14:54.319 --> 14:56.028
Thank you. We're finished.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.161
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal,
but none of it is up for discussion.

15:04.245 --> 15:07.331
Now, as far as you're concerned,
Cris Johnson never existed.

15:07.415 --> 15:11.126
That's going to be difficult considering
100 cameras saw him at the casino.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.837
Not to worry.
Those tapes have been destroyed.

15:14.506 --> 15:16.256
Hey. Is she single?

15:17.258 --> 15:21.136
Cris, you can't keep stealing cars
and having people chase you.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.013
That's not a life.

15:23.097 --> 15:26.767
But you got to forget this girl
that you keep seeing in your head.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.061
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.438
Well, suppose she don't show up?

15:31.523 --> 15:35.067
She already did, at the diner. 8:09.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.278
Well, you got a couple hours.
How about a game of pool?

15:38.363 --> 15:39.655
All right, Irv.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.740
We'll shoot some pool.

15:41.824 --> 15:43.367
We timed every hand of blackjack.

15:43.451 --> 15:46.954
The longest was 89 seconds,
when Johnson pulled a six-card 21.

15:47.038 --> 15:49.957
So we know he can see at least
a minute and a half ahead.

15:50.041 --> 15:53.043
I had our techs run
a radio frequency spectrum analysis.

15:53.127 --> 15:57.089
Came up dry, so he's not receiving
any form of electronic help.

15:57.465 --> 16:00.926
At one point, there was
a two-minute, 16-second delay.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.387
He never bet,
just got up and walked away.

16:03.471 --> 16:06.181
Well, maybe 2:16's too long.
He can't see that far.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.642
Narrows our window a little bit, anyway.

16:09.519 --> 16:13.146
Got him. Vegas P.D.
Got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.

16:18.736 --> 16:20.070
Okay.

16:20.154 --> 16:22.030
Listen, about that girl.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.701
When you looked at the clock,
did you happen to see a calendar?

16:25.785 --> 16:29.871
Because it could be
10 years from now she gets hungry.

16:29.998 --> 16:31.748
It's got to be soon.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.543
I've never seen further ahead
than two minutes.

16:34.877 --> 16:36.295
Except for her.

16:36.379 --> 16:39.423
Now, what do you think
the reason is for that?

16:39.549 --> 16:42.426
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't scare easy.

16:43.428 --> 16:45.220
Maybe she's the one.

16:46.973 --> 16:51.018
Well, when you get like this
there's no talking to you.

16:52.562 --> 16:54.271
She's almost here.

16:54.856 --> 16:56.315
What happened to the diner?

16:56.399 --> 17:00.360
- Somebody else, a cop.
- A cop? Well, then, you got to go.

17:00.445 --> 17:04.114
Hold on. I want to see how much
she knows. What she wants from me.

17:06.867 --> 17:09.243
Cris Johnson. Still here, huh?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.204
Where else would I be?

17:11.539 --> 17:12.873
Special Agent Ferris.

17:12.957 --> 17:15.250
Next time, steal a car without LoJack.

17:17.045 --> 17:18.962
Can we speak privately?

17:20.882 --> 17:22.465
It's okay, Irv.

17:22.550 --> 17:23.925
Go ahead. Thanks.

17:29.932 --> 17:31.933
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

17:32.352 --> 17:36.438
Because you're the man who knows
what I'm going to do before I do it, right?

17:38.066 --> 17:41.234
Oh, the show, right. Right!

17:42.195 --> 17:43.320
I saw you there.

17:43.404 --> 17:45.947
Wonderful. You like magic tricks.

17:46.032 --> 17:50.077
Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks,
clairvoyance...

17:50.244 --> 17:52.079
Whatever you're calling it.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.706
Let's talk about something hard.

17:54.791 --> 17:57.834
A stolen nuclear munition is being
smuggled into the United States,

17:57.919 --> 18:00.337
or may, in fact, already be here.

18:02.006 --> 18:05.759
I want you to look ahead and tell me
where it's going to be deployed.

18:08.971 --> 18:13.308
I think you've got the wrong guy.
It's a magic act.

18:13.601 --> 18:15.560
You going to stick with that story?

18:15.645 --> 18:17.604
Because millions of lives are at risk

18:17.689 --> 18:20.899
and you could, maybe,
prevent a major catastrophe.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.281
On a practical note, we're standing
in front of a stolen vehicle

18:28.366 --> 18:31.368
and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at the casino.

18:31.452 --> 18:33.453
All right,
that was an accident. He had a gun.

18:33.538 --> 18:36.289
- He was going to shoot two people.
- Yeah?

18:38.209 --> 18:40.001
How'd you know that?

18:45.007 --> 18:48.427
No good deed goes unpunished,
does it?

18:49.220 --> 18:51.972
I can fix your legal problems, buddy,
but you've got to step up.

18:52.056 --> 18:56.393
Otherwise, your next magic show
is going to be at Folsom State Prison.

18:58.229 --> 19:02.691
It's ironic,
but people like you who try to help

19:03.276 --> 19:07.738
have been torturing me, in the full sense
of the word, since I was three years old.

19:09.073 --> 19:10.949
What did they call it?

19:11.159 --> 19:12.451
Oh, yeah.

19:12.535 --> 19:15.162
Observed play therapy.

19:15.538 --> 19:18.623
Featuring the marathon, 36-hour,

19:18.708 --> 19:21.418
can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card
game.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.756
So, please, leave me alone

19:26.340 --> 19:29.342
and let me live some semblance
of a normal life.

19:30.219 --> 19:32.095
I'd love to indulge your feelings,

19:32.180 --> 19:34.931
but I am dealing with
a slightly larger picture right now.

19:35.016 --> 19:37.934
Now, you can exercise your
responsibility to help your fellow man

19:38.019 --> 19:40.812
or I will exercise
that responsibility for you.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.323
You're right. I got to go.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.174
He's gone, right?

20:11.594 --> 20:14.054
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.647
Excuse me, honey,
can you get off my car?

20:23.731 --> 20:25.899
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.152
- Mr. Roybal?
- It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?

20:29.237 --> 20:32.239
I have a few questions
if this is a good time.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.991
Gaming Commission? It's after hours.

20:35.076 --> 20:37.327
You guys should be
at a strip club, right? Come on.

20:37.411 --> 20:40.121
What can you tell us
about Cris Johnson?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.669
I don't know who you're talking about.

20:58.307 --> 21:00.517
Let me rephrase the question.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.694
It's destiny.

22:27.897 --> 22:29.981
- Here you go, hon.
- Thanks.

22:41.369 --> 22:42.744
Excuse me.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.037
Hello.

22:45.915 --> 22:49.042
I noticed you were alone, too.
Do you mind if I join you?

22:49.919 --> 22:51.211
Actually, I do.

23:08.980 --> 23:12.440
Sorry to bother you,
but I have a question about the coffee.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.234
The bean they use...

23:14.318 --> 23:17.570
Isn't that something
you should probably ask your waitress?

23:18.739 --> 23:19.906
Yes, it is.

23:27.456 --> 23:29.457
Excuse me, do you have a light?

23:30.251 --> 23:31.751
I don't smoke.

23:33.004 --> 23:35.088
- Here you go, hon.
- Thanks.

23:37.591 --> 23:38.675
Please.

23:39.135 --> 23:40.135
Don't.

23:57.611 --> 23:58.862
Hey, Liz.

23:59.113 --> 24:00.530
Did you follow me here, Kendall?

24:00.614 --> 24:03.241
No! No, I just thought we could talk.

24:04.326 --> 24:06.536
You know,
we got really nothing to talk about.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.580
And I told you that three weeks ago.

24:08.664 --> 24:12.959
Liz, come on, all right? I had an off day.
Just give me another shot.

24:14.003 --> 24:17.047
It's not gonna happen.
Okay? So maybe you should just go.

24:17.131 --> 24:19.632
Do you know
how hard it was to find you?

24:19.884 --> 24:22.552
I was at your apartment.
I tried the Starbucks on Lexington.

24:22.636 --> 24:24.804
I was at the dry cleaner.
All I am asking for

24:24.889 --> 24:28.725
is a few minutes of your time
so that we can work things out.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.645
- Okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now.
- Don't!

24:32.897 --> 24:36.566
Don't say that, please. That's a
terrible thing to say to somebody.

24:36.650 --> 24:38.151
Let go of me, Kendall.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.945
Look, I just... I thought we could talk,
maybe we could take a drive.

24:41.030 --> 24:42.238
And now you are ruining it.

24:42.323 --> 24:43.406
You're hurting me.

24:43.491 --> 24:46.159
Kendall, I think you're having
another off day.

24:46.243 --> 24:48.912
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

24:49.663 --> 24:50.663
Really?

24:54.085 --> 24:56.169
Hi, my name's Cris.

24:59.673 --> 25:01.007
You okay, Kendall?

25:04.386 --> 25:08.348
See, the thing is, I feel connected
to you. I don't know the reason why.

25:09.183 --> 25:11.768
- See, now, listen.
- All right.

25:11.936 --> 25:15.313
I think it's only fair
that you pay for the lady's breakfast.

25:16.273 --> 25:19.067
What are you having?
Pecan pie is amazing.

25:20.277 --> 25:23.488
Excuse me, I can pay
for my own breakfast.

25:23.572 --> 25:24.864
And you know what?

25:24.949 --> 25:26.950
You two work things out.

25:27.701 --> 25:28.868
Okay.

25:30.746 --> 25:31.788
You're hurting me.

25:31.872 --> 25:34.415
Kendall, I think you're having
another off day.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.793
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

25:37.628 --> 25:38.628
Really?

25:38.963 --> 25:40.213
Incoming.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.216
Did you see that?

25:43.717 --> 25:44.968
Goddamn it! Kendall!

25:45.052 --> 25:47.303
What? Don't blame me.
This is your fault.

25:47.388 --> 25:50.723
Get out of here!
Will somebody please call the cops?

25:51.308 --> 25:52.851
I am so sorry.

25:53.102 --> 25:55.395
Are you okay? Let me help you.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.314
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.483
Come on.

26:03.821 --> 26:04.988
Okay.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.659
Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.

26:10.161 --> 26:11.244
Yeah.

26:12.413 --> 26:13.663
I'm Liz.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.290
Cris.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.878
You must have a death wish
getting involved in that.

26:20.004 --> 26:21.462
Here. Just...

26:22.006 --> 26:23.464
- Okay.
- Just...

26:24.216 --> 26:26.342
Okay, hold it there for a little bit.

26:26.427 --> 26:27.844
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:34.435 --> 26:35.810
It will.

26:36.770 --> 26:39.731
- What will?
- Your luck. It's going to change.

26:41.108 --> 26:43.234
What are you? A leprechaun?

26:49.617 --> 26:53.328
Do leprechauns get punched in the face
or have their car stolen?

26:53.412 --> 26:55.205
Your car was stolen?

26:55.289 --> 26:57.957
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.

26:59.501 --> 27:01.836
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.

27:04.298 --> 27:06.507
Hey, is this tooth loose here?

27:08.344 --> 27:10.637
I don't know. I don't think so.

27:11.805 --> 27:12.972
Hurts.

27:15.726 --> 27:17.518
Well, listen,
maybe I could give you a ride,

27:17.603 --> 27:19.229
and I'm kind of going that way.

27:19.313 --> 27:22.649
That would really
be helpful, Liz. Thank you.

27:22.733 --> 27:25.151
Well, I do have to make a stop, though.

27:25.319 --> 27:26.486
It's okay.

27:26.570 --> 27:29.948
And it might take a few hours,
so if you're cool with that.

27:30.032 --> 27:33.576
Hey, look, if you're
uncomfortable with this,

27:34.453 --> 27:36.371
- I'll take the bus.
- No, no, no.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.290
It's fine, it's fine. You're not a psycho.

27:41.418 --> 27:42.627
Right?

27:43.254 --> 27:46.089
Because the first
psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car.

27:46.173 --> 27:48.216
- Okay. Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

27:49.301 --> 27:53.179
Deal.

28:03.065 --> 28:04.941
It's amazing, isn't it?

28:05.025 --> 28:07.151
I end up in a diner where you are,

28:07.861 --> 28:10.363
and we're both headed
in the same direction.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.908
I don't know if I would
call it amazing, but...

28:13.993 --> 28:15.243
Destiny.

28:15.744 --> 28:17.495
That's what it really is.

28:18.372 --> 28:20.873
Okay, I'm starting to
get that psycho vibe.

28:20.958 --> 28:23.876
Oh no. You don't believe in destiny?

28:25.546 --> 28:27.630
Well, even if it does exist,

28:27.881 --> 28:29.590
I don't think I want to know.

28:29.675 --> 28:33.052
I mean, if every move we make
is preordained,

28:33.387 --> 28:34.470
then what is the point of that?

28:34.555 --> 28:37.390
I mean,
life is supposed to be a surprise.

28:38.392 --> 28:39.600
Isn't it?

28:41.186 --> 28:42.812
It would be nice.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.943
Yeah.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.163
So he came in twice a day
for a week at exactly 8:09?

29:00.247 --> 29:03.666
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes,
have a martini, and then he'd go.

29:03.751 --> 29:05.376
Till today, when he met that lady.

29:05.461 --> 29:08.004
You didn't find
anything strange about that?

29:08.172 --> 29:09.756
Not strange enough to call the police.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.674
We got a regular that counts
the corn flakes in his bowl

29:11.759 --> 29:13.009
because it has to be an even number.

29:13.093 --> 29:14.385
Got any cameras?

29:14.470 --> 29:16.179
Inside? No.

29:16.263 --> 29:17.513
Outside?

29:18.766 --> 29:19.849
No.

29:19.933 --> 29:21.809
Did you notice
what kind of car he was driving?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.519
Maybe overhear where they were going?

29:23.604 --> 29:25.730
I don't know what car,
but they were headed up to Flagstaff.

29:25.814 --> 29:27.774
- Flagstaff.
- That's what they said.

29:27.858 --> 29:29.692
Got another regular,
she's always on a diet.

29:29.777 --> 29:32.028
Brings in a scale
and her own salad dressing.

29:32.112 --> 29:34.280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:36.241 --> 29:39.202
Guy knows we're after him,
but he still risks coming here.

29:39.286 --> 29:41.704
- 8:09, twice a day.
- Doesn't even know if it's day or night.

29:41.789 --> 29:44.123
Just the time. He was waiting for her.

29:44.208 --> 29:45.875
All right, there's a traffic cam over there,

29:45.959 --> 29:47.460
a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.

29:47.544 --> 29:50.296
Just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get
lucky and catch him in wide.

29:50.381 --> 29:52.382
Your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?

29:52.466 --> 29:54.884
Had his throat cut last night
after getting a kneecap shot off.

29:54.968 --> 29:57.553
You're telling me this now?
We just talked to him about Johnson.

29:57.638 --> 29:59.806
- Hey, I just found out.
- All right.

30:00.724 --> 30:02.600
- Local weapon?
- Dead end.

30:02.684 --> 30:05.269
And forensics came up empty.
Not a hair, not a fiber.

30:05.354 --> 30:06.562
Somebody wants information.

30:06.647 --> 30:08.731
Now, the next time
anything happens relative to Johnson,

30:08.816 --> 30:10.066
I want to know right away.

30:10.150 --> 30:11.818
I don't care if it's a paper cut.

30:11.902 --> 30:13.319
Okay, boss.

30:35.342 --> 30:37.343
That's good! Good. Right there!

31:38.197 --> 31:41.365
The head of casino security,
what did you learn from him?

31:41.909 --> 31:44.410
For a macho guy, he screams like a girl.

31:44.495 --> 31:47.580
But he was questioned by
federal agents looking for Cris Johnson,

31:47.664 --> 31:48.706
yes?

31:48.790 --> 31:51.334
He said they haven't found him yet.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.753
Do you believe this shit?

31:54.546 --> 31:57.089
He can see things before they happen?

31:57.841 --> 32:00.510
It makes no difference what I believe.

32:00.844 --> 32:03.596
Look, we spent two years setting this up

32:03.764 --> 32:05.598
and that man out there
is worried all this will be

32:05.682 --> 32:07.600
compromised by Johnson.

32:08.268 --> 32:11.437
We're wasting our time
looking for some magician.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.524
We're being paid
to secure the operation, Jones,

32:14.608 --> 32:16.692
not to hunt down some carnival barker.

32:16.777 --> 32:19.362
Really? Then why are
the same authorities

32:19.446 --> 32:22.365
that are looking for us
so interested in him?

32:24.952 --> 32:26.494
Get rid of him.

32:27.621 --> 32:28.996
Do it now.

32:54.940 --> 32:55.940
Hey.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.027
Havasupai Reservation.
I teach here once a week.

33:00.487 --> 33:02.572
The conditions are pretty lousy.

33:02.656 --> 33:05.866
But it's in the Canyon,
one of the Eight Wonders of the World.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.410
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Liz.

33:07.494 --> 33:10.079
Well, a couple hundred years ago,
this tribe was booming.

33:10.163 --> 33:13.708
Plenty of food and a thriving culture.
They should be better off.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.502
But I guess this was just their destiny.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.213
I'd like to meet their shaman.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.133
I read once
that in many North American tribes

33:22.217 --> 33:24.594
their shaman's purpose
wasn't only healing

33:24.678 --> 33:27.555
but they also claimed
to have power over the atmosphere.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.141
To bring on or stop rain.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.978
Even know future events.

33:34.605 --> 33:36.188
Do you think that's possible?

33:36.273 --> 33:38.524
Well, I believe anything is possible.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.068
Me, too.

33:49.077 --> 33:51.704
- Whose birthday?
- One of my students'.

33:53.415 --> 33:55.166
Hey! Hi!

33:56.126 --> 33:57.710
How's it going?

33:58.003 --> 34:00.504
Hello! How is everybody? Good?

34:10.389 --> 34:12.975
- That's good.
- Oh, I was close.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.061
That was a lot.
You messed up on the last part.

34:15.145 --> 34:17.103
On the last part. Yeah.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.565
I thought you weren't
coming back until next Monday.

34:19.650 --> 34:23.069
Well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday.
How could I miss that?

34:23.152 --> 34:24.945
Who's that man you're with?

34:25.405 --> 34:27.197
Is he your boyfriend?

34:27.324 --> 34:30.201
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
He's just my friend.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.244
I think he likes you.

34:33.996 --> 34:35.623
Well, why would you say that?

34:35.706 --> 34:39.251
Because he looked at you
like my brother looks at his girlfriend.

34:56.103 --> 34:58.562
Hey, Jake,
you want to see some magic?

34:58.647 --> 35:00.564
I'll show you something. Come here.

35:00.649 --> 35:02.525
I found this rock out in the Canyon

35:02.609 --> 35:04.944
and I want you to hold it
because it's a magic rock.

35:05.028 --> 35:08.322
That's right.
Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing.

35:09.491 --> 35:10.908
It's magic.

35:16.289 --> 35:17.790
He won't bite.

35:17.874 --> 35:19.458
Happy birthday.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.964
So, you're a magician?

35:25.716 --> 35:26.799
Well...

35:27.342 --> 35:30.094
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.138
The Frank Cadillac Show.

35:32.889 --> 35:34.974
- I thought your name was Cris.
- It is.

35:35.058 --> 35:37.184
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

35:37.728 --> 35:39.645
How did you come up with that?

35:40.564 --> 35:43.816
I picked two things
I really liked and I put them together.

35:44.025 --> 35:46.152
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.

35:48.155 --> 35:49.530
You are odd.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.490
Charming,

35:52.117 --> 35:53.367
but odd.

36:02.419 --> 36:04.837
Cease fire! Visitor on the range!

36:06.381 --> 36:07.506
Nice.

36:08.008 --> 36:09.759
A little close, though.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.138
Okay.

36:15.098 --> 36:18.309
You were right about the traffic cam.
We got a positive ID.

36:40.874 --> 36:42.208
I'm sorry.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.126
Don't be.

36:44.878 --> 36:46.086
It's okay.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.757
Did I drool?

36:50.091 --> 36:51.342
- Drool?
- Yeah.

36:51.551 --> 36:52.885
Drool? No.

36:56.807 --> 36:59.350
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.559
Yeah.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.437
I like rain.

37:06.733 --> 37:08.400
I like rain, too.

37:10.403 --> 37:13.531
You know, once,
I think it was in Denmark,

37:13.907 --> 37:15.491
it rained fish.

37:15.575 --> 37:18.244
Because the sun dehydrated the water

37:18.328 --> 37:20.496
and took it up into the atmosphere,

37:20.872 --> 37:24.416
rehydrated the fish eggs
and they hatched

37:24.835 --> 37:26.585
and it rained fish.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.087
Is that true?

37:28.171 --> 37:31.841
Yeah, in the clouds.
True story. It happened 50 years ago.

37:33.301 --> 37:35.845
I just felt like sharing that with you.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.773
Road's washed out ahead.
You can't cross till morning.

37:47.858 --> 37:49.316
Not even then if this keeps up.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.193
You want to spin around
and go back about two miles,

37:51.278 --> 37:53.571
take your second left.
There'll be a motel there called...

37:53.655 --> 37:55.406
"The Cliffhanger." Thanks.

37:56.658 --> 37:57.867
Right.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.751
Him, right?

38:09.796 --> 38:10.963
That's it?

38:11.923 --> 38:14.633
There's no front plate.
Where's the other side?

38:15.635 --> 38:17.011
I don't have it.

38:17.679 --> 38:19.805
What was that
on the front window? Go back.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.307
Back, back.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.726
Back. There! Zoom in.

38:28.481 --> 38:30.107
That's a permit.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.151
Track it and find her.

38:40.744 --> 38:42.453
I'll light a fire.

38:53.048 --> 38:55.049
Cris, one little problem.

38:56.343 --> 38:59.219
Oh, no, no, I'm going to sleep in the car.

39:04.351 --> 39:05.434
Okay.

39:06.853 --> 39:07.937
Here.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.397
- Thanks.
- Sure.

39:11.232 --> 39:15.194
Hey, did you hear the joke about the
Zen master who ordered the hot dog?

39:15.946 --> 39:17.029
No.

39:17.614 --> 39:20.282
He said he'd have one with everything.

39:23.828 --> 39:27.206
Good night.

40:23.763 --> 40:25.180
What do we have?

40:25.265 --> 40:27.975
They're at the Cliffhanger Motel
outside Flagstaff.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.853
We found an Arizona DOT foreman
who remembered the Land Cruiser.

40:30.937 --> 40:32.104
Why would he do that?

40:32.188 --> 40:35.983
The road was flooded. He was about to
suggest a place to stay.

40:36.359 --> 40:38.318
But Johnson already knew. Right?

40:38.403 --> 40:39.611
Exactly.

40:39.946 --> 40:42.031
Callie. It just got worse.

40:45.785 --> 40:48.370
All right, people,
we've got a nuclear alert.

40:48.455 --> 40:52.332
Code Red, in the Southern
California region. L.A. To San Diego.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.209
95% certainty.

40:54.294 --> 40:57.880
Nuclear emergency search teams
are on the way, but until they get here,

40:57.964 --> 41:01.842
can somebody please tell me what
my agency, the FBI, is doing about it?

41:01.926 --> 41:04.928
Sir, tier-one suspects
have been interrogated.

41:05.013 --> 41:07.389
Cars and premises have been checked,
friends and acquaintances.

41:07.474 --> 41:09.850
We've opened up surveillance
on tier-two and three suspects,

41:09.934 --> 41:11.101
but nothing actionable yet.

41:11.186 --> 41:13.729
Oh, is that what we're doing,
waiting for something actionable?

41:13.813 --> 41:16.231
There are eight million lives
that are precarious at best.

41:16.316 --> 41:18.275
I say we widen the net
to "slightly suspicious"

41:18.359 --> 41:22.321
and get some decent intel
before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.

41:22.655 --> 41:24.239
All right, Callie.

41:24.365 --> 41:26.617
What do you propose we do next?

41:26.910 --> 41:28.660
I believe
that the urgency of this situation

41:28.745 --> 41:31.789
compels the use of any and
all resources to obtain Cris Johnson.

41:31.873 --> 41:34.833
We know where he is.
Let my team pick him up.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.431
He said they're mobilizing.

41:49.516 --> 41:52.518
Standard procedure
when security is escalated.

41:53.228 --> 41:54.937
Tell him to wrap it up.

41:55.021 --> 41:57.189
They'll lead us straight to Johnson.

42:16.209 --> 42:18.836
You hungry?
There's a coffee shop down the road.

42:18.920 --> 42:21.213
I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.

42:21.464 --> 42:22.548
Sure.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.268
What?

42:39.858 --> 42:43.026
There's an Italian painter
named Carlotti,

42:46.739 --> 42:48.365
and he defined beauty.

42:49.325 --> 42:52.077
He said it was
the summation of the parts

42:52.912 --> 42:55.164
working together in such a way

42:55.582 --> 42:59.668
that nothing needed to be added,
taken away or altered.

43:00.962 --> 43:02.379
That's you.

43:05.258 --> 43:06.925
You're beautiful.

43:11.347 --> 43:12.431
Wow.

43:23.401 --> 43:24.902
That was incredible.

43:26.362 --> 43:27.613
What was?

43:29.240 --> 43:30.324
This.

43:52.513 --> 43:54.723
Right here gives us
a good standoff position

43:54.807 --> 43:56.350
and open view of the front of the motel.

43:56.434 --> 43:58.310
We can run multiple point
and area surveillances

43:58.394 --> 44:00.270
from this road here, that turn out.

44:00.355 --> 44:02.064
Get a team
with a parabolic set right here.

44:02.148 --> 44:04.524
That's fine, but I also want
mobile surveillance.

44:04.609 --> 44:05.734
And give me two or three roamers.

44:05.818 --> 44:08.070
If he rabbits on us, I want to be flexible.

44:08.154 --> 44:09.404
Ferris.

44:11.908 --> 44:13.700
Call the local police in Flagstaff.

44:13.785 --> 44:15.244
Tell them to hold the outside perimeter.

44:15.328 --> 44:17.537
I want that area locked down.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.831
A body turned up in an apartment

44:19.916 --> 44:21.583
with a line of sight to my office.

44:21.668 --> 44:23.627
Slit throat, like Roybal.

44:23.711 --> 44:26.505
Somebody's trying
to follow us to Johnson.

44:41.020 --> 44:42.145
Cris.

44:44.148 --> 44:45.232
Yeah.

44:47.944 --> 44:50.696
Maybe there is such a thing as destiny.

45:25.315 --> 45:27.065
Give it 40 seconds.

45:33.740 --> 45:35.991
So, after two minutes, he just
stops seeing what's going to happen?

45:36.075 --> 45:38.035
I sure as hell hope so.

45:56.679 --> 45:58.347
Elizabeth Cooper?

45:58.765 --> 46:00.807
- Yeah.
- Federal Agent Ferris.

46:03.936 --> 46:05.228
What is this about?

46:05.313 --> 46:07.898
I'm going to need
a few minutes of your time.

46:14.072 --> 46:15.447
Yeah, okay.

46:26.459 --> 46:28.460
They're putting her in the car.

46:33.883 --> 46:35.801
Drop the gun! Step back.

46:36.677 --> 46:39.763
It's his gun.
He was going to shoot two people!

46:46.479 --> 46:47.646
This was three days ago?

46:47.730 --> 46:50.148
He used you
to get away from us in Vegas.

46:50.316 --> 46:52.859
You can be pretty sure
that everything he told you is a lie.

46:52.944 --> 46:55.153
He's delusional. A sociopath.

47:00.034 --> 47:03.995
Oh, my God.

47:04.831 --> 47:08.333
Oh, shit.

47:10.253 --> 47:12.087
Go back to the motel.

47:12.296 --> 47:15.215
Have a drink.
Put one of these in his glass.

47:15.341 --> 47:16.925
It'll take five minutes to put him to sleep.

47:17.009 --> 47:18.427
Then we'll come in and get him.

47:18.511 --> 47:19.594
Nobody's been hurt.

47:19.679 --> 47:20.846
But this is important.

47:20.930 --> 47:22.931
You need to do it at least two minutes

47:23.015 --> 47:25.434
after you get him out of the room.

47:28.938 --> 47:32.023
Why do you need me?
Why can't you just get him?

47:32.358 --> 47:35.902
Liz, as I understand it,
you work for a federally funded program

47:35.987 --> 47:38.864
teaching on various reservations.
Is that true?

47:40.450 --> 47:42.117
Yes, that's true.

47:42.201 --> 47:44.786
Well, I'd think you'd be eager to help us.

47:44.871 --> 47:46.830
We're on the same team.

48:02.096 --> 48:04.222
Now they're letting her go.

48:23.826 --> 48:26.161
Hey.

48:26.412 --> 48:28.079
Thanks for the note.

48:28.164 --> 48:29.372
Sure.

48:29.457 --> 48:31.583
- Did you have a nice walk?
- I did.

48:31.751 --> 48:34.294
You know, it's really beautiful here.

48:37.006 --> 48:39.257
I have a present for you.

48:41.302 --> 48:42.969
Oh, thanks.

48:43.763 --> 48:45.555
- I need that.
- Yeah.

49:02.907 --> 49:04.616
Is something wrong?

49:05.618 --> 49:07.452
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

49:07.787 --> 49:10.872
Why don't you go wash up
and I'm gonna make us breakfast?

49:10.957 --> 49:12.374
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:03.676 --> 50:05.218
45 seconds.

50:30.286 --> 50:32.037
One minute, thirty.

51:00.232 --> 51:02.192
And that's two.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.751
- Looks good.
- You think so?

51:20.628 --> 51:21.878
Thank you.

51:34.058 --> 51:35.725
Don't drink that!

51:36.310 --> 51:37.811
It's drugged.

51:38.145 --> 51:40.021
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing.

51:40.106 --> 51:42.107
I have no idea what I'm doing.

51:42.191 --> 51:44.818
Some federal agent
came up to me and said

51:44.902 --> 51:47.862
that you were a delusional sociopath
and showed me this tape.

51:47.947 --> 51:49.614
So maybe you are.

51:49.782 --> 51:50.907
But I don't want to believe that.

51:50.991 --> 51:52.742
I don't think I can believe that.

51:52.827 --> 51:55.036
And she also said that if you ran,

51:55.121 --> 51:56.955
they would shoot you.

51:57.498 --> 51:59.749
So I should drug you instead.

52:00.459 --> 52:03.586
Even if what they said is true,
I don't want you to die.

52:04.130 --> 52:06.131
I don't want you to die.

52:10.636 --> 52:12.303
Cris, is it true?

52:17.810 --> 52:19.102
Oh, shit.

52:36.454 --> 52:37.454
Wow!

52:47.173 --> 52:50.425
Get me broadband noise reduction.
I don't like hearing this!

52:50.509 --> 52:52.844
Speak quietly and act normally.

52:53.429 --> 52:56.264
How long did they say
the drugs would take?

52:58.184 --> 52:59.893
About five minutes.

52:59.977 --> 53:02.103
...a nice inside kick. Wow!

53:11.280 --> 53:12.906
What is he doing?

53:13.032 --> 53:15.366
He's drinking. Give it a minute.

53:16.660 --> 53:18.286
Got a clean shot?

53:21.165 --> 53:22.373
Not yet.

53:30.633 --> 53:33.760
The man in that casino
would have killed two people.

53:35.346 --> 53:36.721
It happened.

53:37.181 --> 53:39.307
It just hadn't happened yet.

53:41.602 --> 53:43.937
Oh, my God, you are delusional.

53:51.695 --> 53:54.739
Fluffy cranberry or a stack
of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids.

53:54.824 --> 53:57.826
Fluffy cranberry
or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes

53:57.910 --> 53:59.118
for the kids in an instant.

53:59.203 --> 54:00.662
Safe? Who knows what's safe?

54:00.746 --> 54:03.665
I knew a man who dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

54:03.749 --> 54:06.584
Safe? Who knows what's safe?

54:07.002 --> 54:09.003
I knew a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

54:09.088 --> 54:12.549
You can't get lost in the woods
if you never go into the woods.

54:13.092 --> 54:14.425
You can't get lost in the woods

54:14.510 --> 54:16.511
if you never go into the woods.

54:18.430 --> 54:21.891
That's right, sir. You're the only person
authorized to do so.

54:22.810 --> 54:26.437
That's right, sir. You are the only person
authorized to do so.

54:26.605 --> 54:28.189
How are you doing this?

54:28.274 --> 54:30.859
I have no idea how, but I can.

54:31.527 --> 54:33.611
I was born with it.

54:36.782 --> 54:38.116
Is this some kind of a trick?

54:38.200 --> 54:40.785
You know we don't have time for that.

54:40.870 --> 54:43.204
You said anything was possible.

54:48.043 --> 54:50.503
So, you see things before they happen?

54:52.506 --> 54:53.590
You see the future?

54:53.674 --> 54:57.302
My future. What'll affect me,
and only two minutes ahead.

54:58.345 --> 54:59.762
Except you.

55:00.306 --> 55:02.390
For some reason, I saw you.

55:04.101 --> 55:05.560
For some reason, I saw you

55:05.644 --> 55:09.022
far beyond anything I'd ever seen before
and I don't know why.

55:12.359 --> 55:14.611
What do you mean, you saw me?

55:15.821 --> 55:17.238
You've been...

55:17.323 --> 55:19.532
You've been doing that to me?

55:20.492 --> 55:22.785
You know what I'm going to do
and what I'm going to say?

55:22.870 --> 55:24.412
That you've just been setting me up?

55:24.496 --> 55:25.997
No, I haven't.

55:26.749 --> 55:30.627
I wanted to find you because
I needed to know why I was seeing you.

55:30.711 --> 55:32.170
And because I...

55:37.801 --> 55:39.510
It wasn't a setup.

55:56.737 --> 55:58.863
What do they want from you?

56:07.206 --> 56:10.333
They think I can help them in matters
of national security.

56:11.961 --> 56:13.503
...call code is received.

56:14.213 --> 56:17.382
The normal SSB radios in the aircraft...

56:17.967 --> 56:21.552
I don't understand.
If you can help, then why don't you?

56:22.429 --> 56:24.055
Because I can't.

56:25.683 --> 56:28.226
I can only give them
a two-minute head start.

56:28.310 --> 56:31.270
And that's if my life
is personally involved.

56:33.148 --> 56:35.274
But with me, you can see further.

56:35.359 --> 56:36.567
Yeah.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.903
But they don't know that.

56:50.165 --> 56:52.917
There's almost $10,000
in this envelope.

56:53.085 --> 56:56.421
They know about you.
You need to get away from here.

56:57.339 --> 56:59.257
What time do you have?

57:00.634 --> 57:01.676
9:10.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.678
Set your watch to 9:17.

57:09.018 --> 57:10.309
Read this when I leave

57:10.394 --> 57:13.896
and wait exactly 45 seconds
before you do what it says.

57:14.023 --> 57:16.065
I'll take Ferris with me.

57:16.734 --> 57:18.818
It might be a week or a month,

57:18.902 --> 57:21.446
but if you can wait, I'll find you.

57:38.630 --> 57:42.967
...and yes, gentlemen, they are on their
way and no one can bring them back.

57:43.052 --> 57:44.761
Something's wrong.

58:15.084 --> 58:16.542
Don't do it.

58:17.169 --> 58:18.753
I already have.

58:24.343 --> 58:26.427
Go get him! Alive!

58:26.512 --> 58:27.512
Let's go!

59:01.213 --> 59:02.797
Bitch! Come on!

59:14.059 --> 59:15.601
Are you crazy?

59:28.866 --> 59:30.032
Oh, shit!

59:50.846 --> 59:53.139
Watch out! Get down!

01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:26.881
Johnson.

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:32.762
You know you're not going to shoot.

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:44.982
You going to let me die?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.848
Hey, I need some help!
Let's get him out of here!

01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:24.355
- Let's get him out of here.
- I got him.

01:01:28.694 --> 01:01:30.695
You all right? You okay?

01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:33.197
Open your eyes. Look at me.

01:01:33.865 --> 01:01:36.492
No good deed goes unpunished,
does it?

01:01:41.707 --> 01:01:43.082
She got him.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:44.709
Now what?

01:01:47.963 --> 01:01:49.171
You see her?

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.119
Smoke?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.215
Thanks for today.

01:02:34.176 --> 01:02:36.761
Could've let me die. I appreciate it.

01:02:37.763 --> 01:02:39.930
That was a real show of character.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:46.604
I know I seem like
the bad guy in all this,

01:02:46.688 --> 01:02:49.231
but in the interests
of preserving our freedom

01:02:49.316 --> 01:02:51.692
there are larger issues at play.

01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:58.199
What about my freedom?

01:02:58.658 --> 01:03:01.118
With freedom comes responsibility.

01:03:01.703 --> 01:03:04.663
I have rights.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:06.707
This isn't about you.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.627
This is about eight million other people.

01:03:11.296 --> 01:03:15.007
If I do what you want,
you'll keep me in this chair forever.

01:03:17.177 --> 01:03:20.346
There is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in Los Angeles.

01:03:21.056 --> 01:03:23.349
And every television station in the world

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.352
will broadcast
the precise details of its detonation.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:30.398
So, go on,
push that two minutes as far as you can

01:03:31.149 --> 01:03:32.566
and find it.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.778
The system, which is still
just a tropical storm,

01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:38.114
is picking up steam
and heading for the U.S.

01:03:38.198 --> 01:03:39.782
Experts fear this storm

01:03:39.866 --> 01:03:43.577
has a good chance of growing
to an F3 status before making landfall.

01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:46.247
More worrisome, though,
is the strong possibility

01:03:46.331 --> 01:03:49.166
that it could travel through
what is known as Hurricane Alley

01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:50.751
into the Gulf of Mexico.

01:03:50.836 --> 01:03:54.422
The warm Gulf waters would
cause the storm to intensify quickly.

01:03:54.506 --> 01:03:57.174
Evacuation plans are already in place...

01:04:18.363 --> 01:04:19.864
...broadcast this afternoon for

01:04:19.948 --> 01:04:22.408
breaking news out of
downtown Los Angeles.

01:04:22.784 --> 01:04:25.703
...largest technology corporations
oppose this idea,

01:04:25.912 --> 01:04:29.039
and tech lobbying
is blamed for stalling the proposal...

01:04:29.207 --> 01:04:31.208
...members of the LAPD bomb squad

01:04:31.293 --> 01:04:33.085
are staging in that area.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:36.964
We go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner
at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.

01:04:37.048 --> 01:04:40.468
Jeff, the standoff began when police
received an anonymous phone call

01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:44.138
stating that explosives would be
detonated at this parking garage

01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:46.974
at 2nd and Broadway at 6:00 tonight.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:50.019
There's no...
They have no idea on a motive.

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:51.437
The victim, however...

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.063
Liz, I'm sorry.

01:04:53.398 --> 01:04:54.482
What?

01:04:55.066 --> 01:04:56.442
What did you say?

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:59.069
The LAPD has surrounded the area.
They've secured a perimeter.

01:04:59.154 --> 01:05:01.614
But now the bomb squad
is making their way

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.283
onto the deck of this building.

01:05:04.409 --> 01:05:08.162
And they're the men that are walking up
with black suits on and such.

01:05:13.585 --> 01:05:14.793
Oh, my God.

01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:19.632
There's been...
There's been an explosion.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.550
There's been an explosion...

01:05:22.427 --> 01:05:24.053
Oh, my God.

01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.181
The victim has been identified

01:05:27.265 --> 01:05:29.350
as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.

01:05:29.768 --> 01:05:33.354
She was strapped to a wheelchair.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:45.157
Sorry.

01:05:50.205 --> 01:05:53.999
Approximately 10% of U.S. Workers
receive stock options.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.460
Many technology companies
give the options away...

01:05:56.545 --> 01:05:59.463
- Tell me what just happened.
- Yeah, I can't.

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:01.840
It won't work like this.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.260
Get me out of this room
and I'll do what you want.

01:06:04.344 --> 01:06:06.804
I beg you, please get me
out of this room.

01:06:16.523 --> 01:06:17.940
Let him out!

01:06:29.327 --> 01:06:31.537
- Callie! Callie, wait up.
- What?

01:06:32.706 --> 01:06:34.373
Forensics report on Betty Peterson.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.293
The dead girl in the apartment?
Her throat was cut, bled out.

01:06:37.377 --> 01:06:40.421
Otherwise, nothing to DNA.
The place was immaculate again.

01:06:40.505 --> 01:06:41.589
How'd it go with Johnson?

01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:43.382
Well, something happened,
but he's not sharing.

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.259
You know, there are traces
of potassium iodide.

01:06:45.343 --> 01:06:46.927
Some medication Peterson was taking?

01:06:47.012 --> 01:06:48.721
- They found an empty pillbox.
- No.

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:52.683
The only reason to take it
is to prevent radiation poisoning.

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:05.029
Hey, wait, can I get a smoke
or something? I need to relax.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:10.868
Thanks.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:13.746
Hey, can I get a light?

01:07:16.082 --> 01:07:17.583
Look at this. Look.

01:07:17.959 --> 01:07:19.251
Ta-da!

01:08:23.108 --> 01:08:24.858
Get it up here! Let's go!

01:08:25.652 --> 01:08:28.904
Base, Air 1. Base, Air 1. I've got visual.

01:08:28.988 --> 01:08:32.116
Subject is spotted
heading south on 5th Street.

01:08:38.665 --> 01:08:41.875
Be advised,
subject is turning east onto Broadway.

01:09:04.023 --> 01:09:06.483
Stay here. Let me deal with this.

01:09:54.866 --> 01:09:56.533
Why are you here?

01:09:58.328 --> 01:09:59.953
They killed her.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.248
Two hours from now.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:07.127
They killed Liz.

01:10:07.587 --> 01:10:09.421
Tell me what you saw.

01:10:10.715 --> 01:10:12.674
I saw them execute her.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.678
Right there.

01:10:17.722 --> 01:10:19.139
On the roof.

01:10:24.729 --> 01:10:27.731
It hasn't happened yet
and I know who has her.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.067
It's the same people we're after.

01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:33.153
There's a reason that they brought
you here. They're using Liz as bait.

01:10:33.238 --> 01:10:34.655
10-1 you go out on that roof,

01:10:34.739 --> 01:10:36.281
they're going to put
a bullet in your brain.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:37.533
I know.

01:10:38.076 --> 01:10:40.577
Right now, she's still alive.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.579
She is, you are, we all are.

01:10:42.956 --> 01:10:44.498
Let's try to keep it that way.

01:10:44.582 --> 01:10:47.084
I help you, you help me, all right?

01:10:49.921 --> 01:10:51.922
I want a two-mile radius.

01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:55.467
Every telephone grid,
shortwave, cell tower.

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:57.010
Shut it down.

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:59.263
What do you want me to do?

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:02.224
Let him shoot you.

01:11:42.807 --> 01:11:44.600
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:46.727
Check the number and dial again.

01:11:50.732 --> 01:11:53.108
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

01:11:53.234 --> 01:11:54.985
FBI! Down on your knees!

01:12:04.495 --> 01:12:06.997
You okay? That looked pretty close.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.082
Sleight of hand.

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:13.879
- You didn't get him.
- Not alive. He fired on the chopper.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:16.006
But it doesn't matter.
He couldn't call in the hit.

01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:17.925
So as far as
they're concerned, you're not here yet.

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:19.635
It buys us time.

01:12:23.348 --> 01:12:26.350
Every way I try this,
she still ends up dead.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:29.269
What if you do it earlier?

01:12:29.354 --> 01:12:30.479
They have to bring her here
in a vehicle, right?

01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:33.148
- Looking for a license plate.
- Right.

01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:43.617
Can you see it?

01:12:45.036 --> 01:12:47.704
It helps if you don't speak right now.

01:13:43.136 --> 01:13:44.970
California plate number

01:13:45.763 --> 01:13:49.224
50KF272.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:53.687
California tag. 5, 0, kilo, foxtrot, 2, 7, 2.

01:14:12.206 --> 01:14:14.249
Please, where are you taking me?

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:18.253
What do you want with me?

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:26.762
Who the hell are you people?

01:14:29.807 --> 01:14:31.475
SITREP, Cavanaugh.

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:32.726
Local SWAT has been deployed and the

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:34.394
regional team just showed
to back us up.

01:14:34.479 --> 01:14:35.562
All right, listen up.

01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:38.148
A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper
will exit the warehouse

01:14:38.232 --> 01:14:41.068
across from Pier 18 compound
in approximately five minutes.

01:14:41.152 --> 01:14:43.070
Four minutes and 27 seconds.

01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:45.072
- Do you mind?
- Not anymore. Go ahead.

01:14:45.156 --> 01:14:48.617
They've got her wrapped
in explosives, wired to a cell phone.

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:51.078
Remote trigger.
Another cell phone sets it off.

01:14:51.162 --> 01:14:52.496
Usually a one-button speed dial.

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.582
They'll take this route
to the entrance gate.

01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:58.251
At that point, Alpha and Bravo
will swarm the entrance...

01:14:58.336 --> 01:15:01.588
If you could just be quiet
and do exactly what I say,

01:15:01.672 --> 01:15:03.507
I'll save your life.

01:15:04.675 --> 01:15:06.218
We need to stop the vehicle here

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:07.511
before they get through the gates.

01:15:07.595 --> 01:15:10.055
Alpha and Bravo
will hold and contain here.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:12.432
Sniper teams will initiate
on Johnson's call.

01:15:12.517 --> 01:15:14.518
On his call. Are we clear?

01:15:15.186 --> 01:15:17.354
All elements shoot to kill any hostiles.

01:15:17.438 --> 01:15:18.688
What about intel?

01:15:18.773 --> 01:15:20.816
We don't need them. We have him.

01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:23.902
All right, everybody! Let's go!

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:25.821
Move out! Let's go!

01:16:08.447 --> 01:16:10.574
Go! Let's go! Move!

01:16:12.243 --> 01:16:14.327
Back up! Back up! Back up!

01:16:29.468 --> 01:16:30.719
Go, go, go!

01:16:31.637 --> 01:16:34.431
- Stop the van.
- Not yet. You'll kill her.

01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:40.562
Now.

01:16:52.617 --> 01:16:54.618
You're good to go! Now, now!

01:16:57.788 --> 01:17:00.749
This is Charlie 1 on approach,
east side of building.

01:17:22.021 --> 01:17:23.563
Move back! Move back!

01:17:24.148 --> 01:17:26.858
This is Alpha Unit, Alpha-U!
We're taking fire!

01:17:27.318 --> 01:17:30.070
Take out the guy on the crane,
northeast corner.

01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:32.906
- Negative on a visual.
- Give me that.

01:17:33.741 --> 01:17:37.202
Aim for the doorway,
eight inches above the guardrail.

01:17:41.332 --> 01:17:42.958
On me, let's go!

01:18:21.414 --> 01:18:23.999
Zed David, Charlie 1 at entry point.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.057
Turn right.

01:18:41.559 --> 01:18:43.059
You're clear.

01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:58.116
You're good! Go! Go!

01:18:58.784 --> 01:19:00.243
Come on! Let's go!

01:19:07.293 --> 01:19:08.376
Number 2 loading dock.

01:19:08.461 --> 01:19:10.170
Repeat. Number 2 loading dock.

01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:11.755
Stop.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:15.592
No!

01:19:17.094 --> 01:19:18.219
Go.

01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:11.940
This is Charlie 1 element,
moving and clearing, over.

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:20.717
Thanks.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:51.414
There are explosives
there, there and there.

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:53.249
Stay close.

01:22:22.613 --> 01:22:24.113
- Sniper.
- Where?

01:22:24.198 --> 01:22:25.740
- Behind us.
- Sniper, six o'clock.

01:22:25.824 --> 01:22:27.951
- Got a visual?
- Nobody move!

01:22:28.035 --> 01:22:29.577
I'll find him.

01:22:35.334 --> 01:22:37.210
Catwalk, second level.

01:22:37.795 --> 01:22:39.963
Catwalk, six o'clock. Second level.

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:42.382
Got him.

01:23:02.987 --> 01:23:04.612
We'll have to clear this deck by deck.

01:23:04.697 --> 01:23:07.282
You take this one. I'll do the rest.

01:23:07.533 --> 01:23:09.450
Let's sweep and clear.

01:24:51.095 --> 01:24:53.262
She's near the engine room.

01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:04.232
Come on, man.

01:25:04.692 --> 01:25:07.485
Release the hostage.
You can still get out of this.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.028
Don't patronize me.

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:14.742
How good are you with that gun?

01:25:14.827 --> 01:25:15.952
Very.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.622
You're going to be okay, Liz.

01:25:19.707 --> 01:25:20.873
Back off!

01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:26.295
I've seen every possible ending here.

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:28.715
None of them are good for you.

01:25:28.799 --> 01:25:30.633
I'll take my chances.

01:25:32.636 --> 01:25:34.387
One more step, fortune teller,

01:25:34.471 --> 01:25:36.889
and it definitely won't be good for you.

01:25:46.734 --> 01:25:48.651
You have one way out of this.

01:25:50.946 --> 01:25:52.572
That wasn't it.

01:25:55.325 --> 01:25:56.659
Liz, look at me.

01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:58.286
It's okay.

01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:00.246
Look at me. It's over.

01:26:02.666 --> 01:26:04.208
It's over.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.710
No, it's not.

01:26:11.675 --> 01:26:15.553
The nuclear device was moved.
We need to find its exact location.

01:26:15.721 --> 01:26:18.931
Now, this registers any significant
detonation in the earth's crust.

01:26:19.016 --> 01:26:21.184
Take a look. Tell me what you see.

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:29.692
Something's wrong.

01:26:33.447 --> 01:26:35.114
I made a mistake.

01:26:36.575 --> 01:26:37.700
What?

01:26:38.035 --> 01:26:39.744
I made a mistake.

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:41.954
- It's happening.
- When?

01:26:42.039 --> 01:26:43.122
Now!

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:26.249
All right, I got four teams in place.

01:27:26.333 --> 01:27:27.500
We're just waiting on the road crew.

01:27:27.584 --> 01:27:28.876
All right.

01:27:28.961 --> 01:27:30.586
- Ferris.
- It's me.

01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:35.758
I'll do it, but I have conditions.

01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:41.055
I want her left out of it.

01:27:42.933 --> 01:27:45.393
I'm sure we can work something out.

01:28:11.962 --> 01:28:18.509
Liz?

01:28:21.597 --> 01:28:22.847
Hey.

01:28:26.351 --> 01:28:27.977
Come back to bed.

01:28:28.478 --> 01:28:29.937
I got to go.

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:33.774
Go where?

01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:41.824
There's something
I have to do. I can't put it off any longer.

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:57.798
Are you coming back?

01:28:57.883 --> 01:28:59.008
Yeah.

01:29:03.263 --> 01:29:05.181
It may be a week

01:29:05.682 --> 01:29:07.016
or a month.

01:29:09.019 --> 01:29:11.479
But if you can wait, I'll find you.

01:29:48.976 --> 01:29:51.310
Here's the thing about the future.

01:29:51.395 --> 01:29:53.062
Every time you look at it,

01:29:53.146 --> 01:29:56.399
it changes because you looked at it.

01:29:56.483 --> 01:29:59.068
And that changes everything else.

01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:14.583
You ready?

01:30:15.544 --> 01:30:16.244
Yeah.
