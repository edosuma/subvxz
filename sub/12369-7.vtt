WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.753
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:06.464
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.717
[overlapping chatter]

00:08.800 --> 00:11.302
- STOP!

00:11.386 --> 00:13.930
ONE AT A TIME,
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL

00:14.013 --> 00:17.100
JUST HAPPENED IN MY CHURCH.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.227
JOY, WHY DON'T YOU START?

00:19.310 --> 00:21.646
- I'M SORRY WE SPOILED
WILBUR'S CHRISTENING.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.815
BUT, AS USUAL, IT WAS ALL
MY MOTHER'S FAULT.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.317
- OH, TWADDLE.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.945
- YOU DID DROP A RATHER LARGE
BOMBSHELL.

00:29.028 --> 00:31.156
- PLEASE, I LIVED
THROUGH THE BLITZ.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.450
BOMBSHELLS WERE
DROPPING EVERYWHERE.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.784
PEOPLE DYING.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.121
DID ANYONE DIE TODAY?

00:38.204 --> 00:41.124
- NOT YET.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.126
- OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A HISTORY
OF CONFLICT ISSUES HERE.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.003
AS A TRAINED COUNSELOR,
PERHAPS I CAN HELP.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.171
- FINE.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.630
I WELCOME HAVING
A NEUTRAL OBSERVER

00:47.714 --> 00:49.507
BECAUSE I KNOW
I'LL WIN!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.801
- AND I HAVE UTTER CONFIDENCE
THAT THE RULING

00:51.885 --> 00:53.261
WILL BE IN MY FAVOR.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.971
- THERE'S NO RULING
OR WINNING.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.514
THIS IS A HOUSE OF GOD,

00:56.598 --> 00:59.642
NOT <i> THE VOICE.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:02.312
LET'S REMEMBER, WE'RE ALL HERE
FOR THE LOVE OF THIS BABY.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.355
- A BABY THAT,
UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.859
REJOYLA HADN'T EVEN
TOLD ME EXISTED.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.487
SO, POINT FOR ME.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.821
- THERE ARE NO POINTS.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.158
- BUT IF THERE WERE,
I'D HAVE ONE.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.285
- TECHNICALLY, TWO.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.828
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT OWEN, EITHER.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.663
- WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.999
- IF YOU HAVE TO ASK...

01:24.709 --> 01:25.835
- COULD WE PLEASE JUST
START AT THE BEGINNING?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.129
JOY.
- WELL...

01:28.213 --> 01:30.507
OWEN AND I NEEDED A CHURCH
FOR THE CHRISTENING,

01:30.590 --> 01:33.176
AND ELKA KINDLY
SUGGESTED THIS ONE.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.345
I THINK THIS CHURCH
IS LOVELY.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.638
- DO YOU THINK
YOUR MOM'LL LIKE IT?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.348
- I HOPE SO.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.559
OH, I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO MY DEAR MOTHER'S ARRIVAL.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.021
- LIAR! YOU NEVER SAID
ANY SUCH THING.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.191
- WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T
USE THOSE EXACT WORDS.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.360
BUT THAT WAS THE GIST.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.654
I THINK THIS CHURCH
IS LOVELY.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.155
- DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM'LL
LIKE IT?

01:54.239 --> 01:57.033
- I HOPE SO. NOW, IF THE XANAX
I TOOK WILL JUST KICK IN,

01:57.116 --> 01:58.660
MAYBE I CAN GET THROUGH
ONE VISIT WITH MY MOTHER

01:58.743 --> 02:01.162
WITHOUT BLOWING MY BRAINS OUT.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.373
- SHE CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.833
- POOR LITTLE LAMB.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.334
RAISED BY KIND PEOPLE.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.919
YOU HAVE
NO NATURAL DEFENSES.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.923
WHICH IS WHY I'VE MADE YOU
THIS LIST.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.716
IT'S ALL THE LIES
YOU'LL HAVE TO MEMORIZE

02:13.800 --> 02:15.385
BEFORE SHE GETS HERE.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.137
- I'M A BOARD-CERTIFIED
CARDIOLOGIST?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.515
- MM-HMM.
ALSO RIGHT-HANDED.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.268
SHE THINKS LEFTIES
ARE LAZY.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.563
- WHAT IF SHE ASKS WHERE I WENT
TO RIGHT-HANDED MEDICAL SCHOOL?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.439
- WELL, IT'S ALL
IN THE APPENDIX.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.902
OH, AND HERE'S YOUR FORGED
PRESCRIPTION PAD.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.155
THANKS FOR THE XANAX,
BY THE WAY.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.242
- HEY, SORRY WE'RE LATE,

02:39.325 --> 02:41.202
BUT VICTORIA HAD TO TELL
EVERYONE WE MET

02:41.286 --> 02:43.037
ALL ABOUT HER FAMOUS
NEW BOYFRIEND,

02:43.121 --> 02:44.747
INCLUDING THE STREET MIME.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.041
- HE ASKED.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.044
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
IN SO MANY WORDS.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.046
- THAT IS A DISGRACE.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.923
- OH, ELKA, NOT THIS AGAIN.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.426
SHE'S HEAD OF THE RESTORATION
COMMITTEE FOR THE FRESCO,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.428
AND SHE THINKS THE RESTORER'S
TAKING TOO LONG.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.096
- WELL, HE IS.

03:00.179 --> 03:03.099
GIVE ME A BOX OF PAINTS
AND A SIX-PACK OF BEER.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.477
I'LL KNOCK THAT BABY
OUT TONIGHT.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.813
- WELL, REVEREND LARE
SAID HE WAS VERY PLEASED

03:08.897 --> 03:10.648
WITH THE WAY
THE WORK IS GOING.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.109
- OH, THAT OLD PULPIT POUNDER
DOESN'T KNOW HIS ASS

03:13.192 --> 03:15.486
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.907
WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID WAS,

03:18.990 --> 03:24.746
"ASK ANYONE,
HE'S THE HOLIEST MAN AROUND."

03:26.539 --> 03:28.249
- UH-HUH.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.376
- APROPOS OF HOLES
IN THE GROUND,

03:30.460 --> 03:31.836
MY BOYFRIEND,
SIR EMMET LAWSON,

03:31.920 --> 03:35.340
IS QUITE DEVOTED TO GOLF.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.466
- YOU'RE DATING
EMMET LAWSON?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.134
- OH, IF IT'S
A SIN TO LOVE,

03:38.217 --> 03:40.178
THEN I AM GUILTY.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.013
- WOW. WELL,
NO WONDER YOU'RE UPSET

03:42.096 --> 03:44.974
THAT MELANIE MADE YOU FAT.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.351
- WHAT DID YOU
JUST CALL ME?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.271
- I-I MEAN, UH...

03:50.355 --> 03:52.190
POINT FOR YOU.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.942
- I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
DOING POINTS.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.527
- I'M ON BOARD NOW.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.238
- OKAY, I DO FEEL GUILTY THAT
I MADE VICTORIA GAIN WEIGHT,

03:59.322 --> 04:03.201
BUT SHE JUST WOULDN'T STOP
WITH THE SIR EMMET LAWSON TALK.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.327
IT GETS OLD.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.037
- IT REALLY DOES.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.998
- HONEST TO GOD.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.291
[cell phone rings]

04:10.375 --> 04:12.001
- [clears throat]

04:12.085 --> 04:13.628
[gasps]
IT'S HIM.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.297
MY BOYFRIEND,
SIR EMMET LAWSON.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.007
HELLO,
MY BOYFRIEND SIR EMMET LAWSON.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.637
- I'M GLAD SHE'S IN LOVE,
I JUST WISH I COULD

04:22.720 --> 04:24.514
GET HER TO SHUT UP
ABOUT IT.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.224
- WHEN I'M TRAINING DOGS,

04:26.307 --> 04:28.685
I USE
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.187
REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOR
WITH A TREAT.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.356
- SHE IS PRETTY SUGGESTIBLE.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.191
BUT SHE DOESN'T EAT TREATS.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.651
UNLESS...

04:36.734 --> 04:39.320
I COULD SAY MY P.R. FIRM

04:39.404 --> 04:42.448
IS TEST-MARKETING AN
EXPERIMENTAL WEIGHT LOSS TREAT.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.659
IS THIS A BUTTERY CARAMEL,

04:44.742 --> 04:48.246
OR...IS IT
A MAGIC DIET CANDY?

04:48.329 --> 04:51.374
- MAGIC DIET CANDY?
WHERE? I WANT...

04:51.457 --> 04:54.544
- AM I EVER GOING TO GET
A CHANCE TO SPEAK?

04:54.627 --> 04:58.381
REJOYLA ALWAYS ACCUSES ME
OF BEING JUDGMENTAL.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.384
AND THOUGH I WAS
A BIT SHOCKED

05:01.467 --> 05:04.220
THAT MY GRANDSON
OUT OF WEDLOCK

05:04.303 --> 05:06.723
HAD HIS OWN SON
OUT OF WEDLOCK,

05:06.806 --> 05:09.058
ONE MUST GO
WITH THE TIMES.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.395
SO I ARRIVED FOR MY VISIT

05:12.478 --> 05:16.024
AS AN OPEN
AND LOVING GRANDMOTHER.

05:16.107 --> 05:20.236
OH, THERE'S
THE LITTLE BASTARD!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.125
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY, MOTHER?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.419
{\an8}"LITTLE BASTARD"?

05:36.502 --> 05:39.255
{\an8}- IT'S STILL BETTER
THAN WILBUR.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.389
{\an8}- BABY CAN'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD I'M SAYING.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.807
{\an8}CAN HE, DOCTOR?

05:49.891 --> 05:50.767
{\an8}- WHO?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.393
{\an8}OH.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.103
{\an8}YES, YES, OF COURSE.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.439
{\an8}AS A BOARD-CERTIFIED
CARDIOLOGIST,

05:56.522 --> 05:58.399
{\an8}THAT'S NOT REALLY
MY SPECIALTY.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.734
{\an8}- IT WAS STANFORD, RIGHT?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.152
{\an8}- OWEN.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.740
{\an8}- I WAS TALKING ABOUT
YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.825
{\an8}- OH, RIGHT!
OF COURSE.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.452
{\an8}BIG STANFORD DUDE, YEAH.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.913
{\an8}I REALLY MISS...
CALIFORNIA?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.293
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, PHILIPA,
YOUR ACCENT

06:17.376 --> 06:20.713
{\an8}IS REMINDING ME OF MY BOYFRIEND,
SIR EMMET LAWSON.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.508
{\an8}AS YOU KNOW, HE WAS KNIGHTED
BY YOUR QUEEN.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.676
{\an8}- OH, PLEASE.
HE'S AUSTRALIAN.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.054
{\an8}YOU MIGHT AS WELL
KNIGHT A SHEEP.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.017
{\an8}- BUT COULD THAT SHEEP
WIN ACADEMY AWARDS?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.019
{\an8}AND SPEAKING OF AWARDS--
- VICTORIA, MAGIC DIET CANDY?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.147
{\an8}- OH, THANK YOU.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.858
{\an8}- UM, MAYBE YOU COULD OPEN
A BOTTLE OF WINE FOR US.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.944
{\an8}- MM, OF COURSE.

06:43.027 --> 06:43.986
- AND WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE,

06:44.070 --> 06:45.029
MAYBE A TRAY
OF HORS D'OEUVRES.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.323
- GREAT IDEA.

06:47.406 --> 06:52.328
- HERE IS THE LATEST EDITION
OF THE BABY BOOK I USED.

06:52.411 --> 06:55.623
<i>LET THEM CRY: THE BRITISH GUIDE</i>
<i>TO RAISING CHILDREN.</i>

06:57.917 --> 07:00.128
THE PAGES ARE ALL BLANK.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.339
- YOU DON'T READ IT.
IT'S FOR SPANKING.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.715
- YOU SEE
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH?

07:04.799 --> 07:07.009
- OH, CALM DOWN, REJOYLA.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.428
IT'S A JOKE.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.348
LAUGHTER'S THE BEST
MEDICINE, ISN'T IT, DOCTOR?

07:12.431 --> 07:16.018
- AS A BOARD-CERTIFIED
CARDIOLOGIST...

07:16.102 --> 07:17.854
THAT'S NOT REALLY
MY SPECIALTY.

07:17.937 --> 07:22.400
- NOW, HERE IS BABY WILBUR'S
REAL GIFT.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.985
- [laughs]
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.028
GOOD ONE.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.321
- DON'T BE CHEEKY.

07:31.742 --> 07:35.830
SCROGGS HAVE BEEN CHRISTENED
IN THIS GOWN FOR GENERATIONS.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.874
- YEAH, BUT AS I MENTIONED
ON THE PHONE,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.585
HE'S WEARING A SIMPLE
COTTON ONESIE.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.588
- NONSENSE.
NO GOD-FEARING PRIEST

07:43.671 --> 07:46.674
WOULD BAPTIZE A CHILD
IN A ONESIE.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.093
- HE'S NOT BEING BAPTIZED
BY A PRIEST.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.095
OWEN IS PROTESTANT.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.891
- WHAT? HE'S BEING BAPTIZED
BY A HERETIC?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.896
REJOYLA, IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF A WARM WELCOME,

07:59.979 --> 08:01.564
YOU HAVE FAILED HIDEOUSLY.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.565
- COULD BE WORSE.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.651
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
LAST YEAR, THEY SHOT ME.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.404
- WHAT?
- OWEN, NO.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.072
- OH! ACCIDENTALLY, OF COURSE.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.074
NOTHING SERIOUS.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.578
ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I STILL GET
A LITTLE NUMBNESS.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.122
- YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU MET
OWEN AND WILBUR

08:18.206 --> 08:19.999
TWO WEEKS AGO,

08:20.082 --> 08:23.586
AND NOW I FIND OUT
THAT YOU SHOT HIM LAST YEAR?

08:23.669 --> 08:26.756
AND YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING
MY GRANDCHILDREN FROM ME

08:26.839 --> 08:28.799
FOR SOME WHATEVER--
RIDICULOUS--

08:28.883 --> 08:31.093
OH...OH...

08:31.177 --> 08:32.761
- OH, GOD, WHAT IS IT NOW?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.806
- OH, IT'S...
IT'S JUST A CHEST PAIN.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.059
FROM THE IMPACT
OF THIS LIE, NO DOUBT.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.604
IT'S NOTHING, IT'S NOTHING.
I'M SURE IT'S...

08:41.687 --> 08:43.022
RIGHT, DOCTOR?

08:43.105 --> 08:45.942
- AS A BOARD CERTIFIED
CARDIOLOGIST, THAT'S--

08:46.025 --> 08:48.819
OH, GOD, I THINK THIS ACTUALLY
IS MY SPECIALTY.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.618
- I COULD HAVE DIED!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.119
- THE ONLY THING
YOU COULD HAVE DIED FROM

08:57.203 --> 08:59.914
IS OVERACTING! YOU'VE HAD
MORE FAKE HEART ATTACKS

08:59.997 --> 09:01.415
THAN FRED SANFORD!

09:03.543 --> 09:07.171
AND YOU--HOW COULD YOU FORGET
NUMBER 67 ON THE LIST--

09:07.255 --> 09:09.507
WE MET TWO WEEKS AGO.
NUMBER 67!

09:09.590 --> 09:11.133
- SHOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE HIGHER ON THE LIST,

09:11.217 --> 09:14.136
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE NUMBER ONE?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.597
IT WAS BURIED UNDER
AN AVALANCHE OF OTHER LIES

09:16.681 --> 09:19.642
LIKE AMATEUR PASTRY CHEF
AND MANCHESTER UNITED FAN.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.936
- YOU DON'T ROOT FOR MAN U?

09:22.019 --> 09:25.147
SHOOT HIM AGAIN!

09:25.231 --> 09:28.359
- THIS IS FUN.
I'M GLAD I STAYED.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.323
- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE
FOCUSING ON THESE HARMLESS LIES

09:34.407 --> 09:37.118
WHEN ONE OF US HAS BEEN
LITERALLY DISFIGURED!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.539
- WHO WAS DISFIGURED?

09:41.622 --> 09:42.790
- ME!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.917
I GAINED THREE POUNDS
ON THOSE CANDIES.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.670
- FIVE.
I TURNED YOUR SCALE BACK.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.132
- DAMN HER.
DAMN HER TO HELL.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.508
- HE CAN'T.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.010
HE'S PROTESTANT.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.346
IT'S ALL CARROT AND NO STICK
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.348
- VICTORIA, I'M SORRY.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.350
I JUST WANTED YOU TO STOP
TALKING ABOUT EMMET.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.019
I GUESS I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.813
- I DID UNSPEAKABLE THINGS
FOR YOU.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.523
- THANK YOU FOR GOING
TO THE POST OFFICE.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.066
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.485
IT'S MY DRESS
FOR THE CHRISTENING.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.071
IT'S THE ONE THE GOOD WIFE WORE
TO VISIT BIG IN PRISON.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.906
- NO, NO. NO, THAT'S
THE SAME DRESS THAT I ORDERED

10:15.990 --> 10:17.533
TO WEAR TO THE CHRISTENING.

10:17.616 --> 10:20.202
- OH, DEAR,
WHAT A DILEMMA.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.996
WHATEVER SHALL WE DO?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.964
- WHY DON'T YOU WEAR THE DRESS
THIS TIME,

10:32.048 --> 10:33.674
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE SO THIN,

10:33.758 --> 10:36.135
I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIT INTO MINE
AFTER ALL THAT DIET CANDY.

10:36.218 --> 10:40.222
- OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE THE BEST!

10:40.306 --> 10:43.267
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.
YES, YOU ARE.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.398
MAYBE YOU COULD
STEAM IT FOR ME TOO?

10:55.446 --> 10:58.866
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE ABUSING
VICTORIA JUST A LITTLE?

10:58.949 --> 11:00.910
- DON'T YOU SEE
HOW PLEASANT SHE'S BEING?

11:00.993 --> 11:04.080
- IT WASN'T A CRITICISM.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.750
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.544
- OH, I'M JUST LOOKING
AT SOME OF MY OLD PAINTINGS.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.921
- WHAT--YOU DID THESE?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.090
- I DID ALL THE ARTWORK
IN THIS HOUSE.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.758
- THAT'S AMAZING!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.885
OH, I WISH I COULD PAINT
LIKE THIS.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.345
- WELL, YOU CAN.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.555
IT'S AS EASY AS ONE,
TWO, THREE.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.767
ONE IS YELLOW,
TWO IS BLUE,

11:24.850 --> 11:26.811
AND THREE IS RED.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.729
- WAIT A MINUTE.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.440
WE HAVE PAINT-BY-NUMBER ART
ON OUR WALLS?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.651
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT I AM
DATING SIR EMMET LAWSON?

11:33.734 --> 11:36.904
- I DON'T THINK ANYONE
CAN FORGET THAT.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.950
- AND DON'T YOU HAVE
BIGGER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT...

11:41.033 --> 11:43.244
TUBBY?

11:44.995 --> 11:47.456
- HOW CAN MY SKIRT BE
TIGHTER THAN I REMEMBER?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.000
I'VE BEEN EATING A TON
OF MAGIC DIET CANDY.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.253
- WELL, THE WAY THE MAGIC WORKS

11:52.336 --> 11:53.838
IS SOMETIMES YOU GAIN
A TEENY BIT OF WEIGHT

11:53.921 --> 11:55.464
IN THE BEGINNING,

11:55.548 --> 11:56.966
BUT YOU'LL DEFINITELY
START LOSING IT.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.802
- I CAN BARELY BREATHE
IN THIS THING!

11:59.885 --> 12:02.471
MELANIE, PRAY WITH ME THAT
THE CANDY KICKS IN SOON.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.183
DEAR LORD...

12:06.267 --> 12:08.811
PLEASE LOOK WITH FAVOR
ON THE MAGIC CANDY

12:08.894 --> 12:10.855
OF MY DEAR FRIEND MELANIE,
YOUR SERVANT--

12:10.938 --> 12:11.981
- OKAY, VICTORIA, STOP.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.024
STOP BEFORE I GET HIT
BY LIGHTING.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.528
UM...[laughs]
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.406
- JESUS!

12:22.074 --> 12:24.285
- IS LORD.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.875
- ALL RIGHT,

12:30.958 --> 12:33.127
NOW WE'RE UP TO
THE CHRISTENING PART.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.671
AND YOU KNOW HOW WELL
<i>THAT</i> WENT.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.673
- MRS. SCROGGS, WILL YOUR
HUSBAND BE JOINING US?

12:37.756 --> 12:39.175
- HARD TO SAY.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.343
HE WENT OUT FOR GROCERIES
30 YEARS AGO.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.388
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM SINCE.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.432
- ANOTHER FUN FACT.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.768
BOTH OWEN AND THE BABY
WERE BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.440
- WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S
ONE INNOCENT AMONG US.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.026
- THANK YOU.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.196
- I WAS REFERRING
TO THE BABY.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.698
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO MELANIE.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.743
SHE'S A SINNER AND A LIAR
AND A BETRAYER.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.536
- GETTING YOU TO SHUT UP
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND

13:07.620 --> 13:09.580
WAS WORTH A FEW BAGS
OF CANDY.

13:09.663 --> 13:10.956
- BAGS?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.000
[gasps]
OH, MY...

13:13.083 --> 13:15.377
- SHALL WE BEGIN
THE CHRISTENING?

13:15.461 --> 13:16.754
- IS IT REALLY A CHRISTENING

13:16.837 --> 13:19.548
IF THE BABY SHOWS UP
IN A DINGY OLD NAPPY?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.550
- AGAIN, WILBUR IS WEARING
A ONESIE.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.344
HE'S COMFORTABLE.

13:23.427 --> 13:27.056
- WHEN YOU ASK GOD TO FREE
YOUR CHILD FROM ORIGINAL SIN,

13:27.139 --> 13:29.725
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED
ABOUT MAKING HIM LOOK HIS BEST,

13:29.808 --> 13:34.396
NOT HOW QUICKLY
YOU CAN UNSNAP HIS CROTCH!

13:34.480 --> 13:36.732
- MOTHER,
THIS IS WHAT OWEN WANTS.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.359
- ACTUALLY,
OWEN JUST WANTS THIS TO BE OVER.

13:38.442 --> 13:42.404
- REJOYLA, I SIMPLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DISMISS

13:42.488 --> 13:45.115
ALL MY WISHES AFTER
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE FOR YOU.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.910
- EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR ME?
OH, PLEASE.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.954
NAME ONE THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR ME.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.206
- SAVED YOU FROM
A MISERABLE MARRIAGE

13:52.289 --> 13:54.542
TO THAT TEENAGE HOOLIGAN
WHO GOT YOU PREGNANT.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.043
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:56.126 --> 13:57.545
SIMON NEVER ASKED ME
TO MARRY HIM.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.089
- BECAUSE I STOPPED HIM!

14:00.172 --> 14:01.757
- WHAT?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.133
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.552
[pop]

14:15.187 --> 14:17.106
- IT'S A MIRACLE!

14:25.614 --> 14:27.575
- SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED
THE COURSE OF MY LIFE

14:27.658 --> 14:29.618
WITHOUT EVEN
CONSULTING ME.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.120
I THOUGHT SIMON
ABANDONED ME.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.621
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHAT MESSED UP

14:32.705 --> 14:34.623
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MEN EVER SINCE.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.125
- SHE'S RIGHT.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.129
SHE CANNOT PICK 'EM.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.797
- OWEN, WOULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE WILBUR TO THE ALTAR?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.132
WE'LL BE THERE SOON.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.926
- SO, WE'RE STILL
DOING THIS?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.386
- I MAY DO IT TWICE.

14:47.469 --> 14:52.141
THIS KID COULD USE
THE PROTECTION.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.561
NOW, I'M GOING TO DISPENSE WITH
THE LESSER TRANSGRESSIONS FIRST.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.646
MELANIE,
WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.984
{\an1}YOU CAN MAKE IT UP TO VICTORIA
BY DOING HER BIDDING FOR A WEEK.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.654
AND LISTENING TO HER
ENDLESS EMMET LAWSON STORIES.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.449
- SO A NORMAL WEEK.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.287
- THANK YOU.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.171
- NOW YOU.

15:25.549 --> 15:29.678
YOU TURNED ST. JOHN
INTO A MONKEY.

15:29.762 --> 15:34.183
- IN MY DEFENSE, THE BIBLE
NEVER SAID WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.520
- IT WOULD HAVE
IF HE LOOKED LIKE A MONKEY.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.938
NOW, RATHER THAN
RESTORE THE PAINTING,

15:40.022 --> 15:41.482
WE'RE GONNA GO WITH
THE WHOLE ANIMAL MOTIF

15:41.565 --> 15:43.984
AND TURN IT INTO
A NOAH'S ARK THING.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.361
- FINE.
I'LL GET MY BRUSHES.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.529
- NO, YOU WON'T.
YOU WON'T.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.406
WE'RE GONNA
HIRE A REAL ARTIST.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.200
- I KNOW JUST THE ARTIST.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.993
- IT'S NOT YOU.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.579
- FINE.

15:55.663 --> 15:59.541
I'LL TAKE MY TALENT
TO THE TEMPLE DOWN THE STREET.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.711
SHALOM.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.256
- NOW TO THE HEART
OF THE MATTER.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.926
- FINALLY.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.552
SIMON WANTED TO MARRY ME,
AND YOU TURNED HIM AWAY.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.887
HOW COULD YOU?

16:11.970 --> 16:15.516
- YOU WERE TEENAGERS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.685
BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE
I KNEW YOU'D SAY YES.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.853
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.065
BUT ALSO ABOUT THAT LITTLE BABY
AND WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIM.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.567
- THAT WAS NOT YOUR CHOICE.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.112
AND I THINK WHAT'S BEST
FOR ME NOW IS THAT YOU AND I

16:28.195 --> 16:30.406
NEVER--
- JOY. EXCUSE ME.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.908
MRS. SCROGGS,
COULD YOU GIVE US A MOMENT?

16:32.991 --> 16:36.578
- FINE. I WAS GOING TO ASK
FOR A CIGARETTE BREAK ANYWAY.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.416
NOW THAT I KNOW MY GRANDSON
ISN'T A CARDIOLOGIST,

16:40.499 --> 16:43.293
I FEEL I CAN SMOKE
AS MUCH AS I WANT.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.632
- WHY DID YOU SEND HER OUT?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.260
I NEED HER TO HEAR
ALL THE WAYS SHE'S HURT ME.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.221
AND I NEED FOR HER TO SAY SHE'S
SORRY FOR EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE!

16:54.304 --> 16:58.767
- JOY, PLEASE.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.227
PEOPLE OFTEN
ASK ME TO MEDIATE

17:00.310 --> 17:02.479
CONFRONTATIONS
WITH THEIR PARENTS,

17:02.563 --> 17:04.397
HOPING TO GET
THE SAME THING YOU WANT.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.443
BUT 99 OUT OF 100 TIMES,
WHAT THEY GET

17:07.526 --> 17:09.653
IS A DEFENSIVE,
WOUNDED PARENT

17:09.737 --> 17:12.781
WHO REMEMBERS THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.950
AND THE RELATIONSHIP
ONLY WORSENS.

17:15.032 --> 17:18.494
- I'LL TAKE THOSE ODDS.
I NEED THIS.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.580
- LOOK, YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT,

17:20.664 --> 17:23.584
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD
TAKE A CUE FROM MELANIE.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.127
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:25.210 --> 17:28.630
- SOMETIMES WE GET
MORE OF WHAT WE WANT WITH CANDY.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.966
- WHAT, SO I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO FORGIVE HER?

17:31.049 --> 17:34.928
- WE ARE PRETTY BIG
ON FORGIVENESS HERE.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.015
- WELL, CAN YOU RECOMMEND
A CHURCH THAT'S BIG ON REVENGE?

17:38.098 --> 17:42.311
BECAUSE I WANT TO GO THERE.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.314
- OH, AND THEN EMMET TEXTED ME
THE FUNNIEST THING FROM LONDON.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.358
WAIT, I WANT TO GET IT
WORD FOR WORD.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.320
UH, "I'M PERFORMING
AT THE OLD VIC,

17:51.403 --> 17:52.946
BUT I'M DATING
THE YOUNG VIC."

17:53.030 --> 17:55.199
[laughs]

17:55.282 --> 17:56.700
OH.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.790
- HAS ANYONE SEEN JOY?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.666
- SHE'S OUT ON THE PORCH.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.504
- ELKA,
YOU'RE PAINTING AGAIN.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.507
- IT'S A PRESENT FOR YOU.
- REALLY?

18:11.590 --> 18:12.382
- IT'S WILBUR,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.468
IN THE CHRISTENING GOWN
YOU GAVE HIM.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.523
- REJOYLA.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.525
[closes door]

18:29.608 --> 18:32.194
WE HAVE TO TALK SOMETIME.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.489
- WELL, I DEFINITELY
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.537
- GO AHEAD.
LET ME HAVE IT.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.206
- WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS...

18:44.289 --> 18:46.834
THANK YOU.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.876
- WHAT?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.837
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.506
I WOULD HAVE MARRIED SIMON,
IT WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED,

18:52.589 --> 18:55.175
AND I WOULD'VE BEEN
A SINGLE MOTHER.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.886
YOU KNEW HOW HARD THAT WAS,
AND YOU WANTED TO SPARE ME.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.722
AND ALSO...

19:00.806 --> 19:03.559
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T
EXACTLY ENJOYED

19:03.642 --> 19:06.895
YOUR CONSTANT,
LIFELONG CRITICISM,

19:06.979 --> 19:11.400
I DO REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU WANT THE BEST FOR ME.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.610
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU'VE EVER WANTED.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.533
[door opens]

19:19.616 --> 19:22.953
- ALL CLEAN.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.914
BOY, KIDS ARE
A LOT OF WORK.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.250
- OWEN,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.878
WOULD YOU MIND
A BIT OF ADVICE?

19:30.961 --> 19:33.297
- OKAY, SURE.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.010
- WHEN HE GETS OLDER
AND MAKES MISTAKES,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.262
DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HIM.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.930
CHILDREN AREN'T PERFECT,

19:42.014 --> 19:44.641
BUT THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.686
THE WORLD WILL TELL HIM
HE HAS FLAWS.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.606
TRY TO BE THE ONE
THAT LOOKS AT HIM

19:50.689 --> 19:53.692
WITH THE KINDEST EYES.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.824
OH, IT'S GETTING
A BIT CHILLY.

20:00.908 --> 20:01.783
I NEED A SWEATER.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.413
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING, JOY?

20:06.496 --> 20:08.290
- NO, MOM.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.876
I THINK I GOT
EVERYTHING I NEED.
