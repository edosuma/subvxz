WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:07.659
I know what brought you here,
and it's not money.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.792
It's family.

00:09.835 --> 00:13.013
You want to set something aside
for the people you love.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.058
Your children. Their children.
Am I right?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
Yes.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.322
That's...
Absolutely.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.324
I'm the same.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.760
That's why I asked my son

00:21.804 --> 00:23.153
to work with me.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.937
Family is

00:24.981 --> 00:27.244
everything.

00:27.288 --> 00:30.073
We call our firm Safe
Harbor Wealth Management,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.988
and that's what it is--

00:32.032 --> 00:33.990
a safe place for your money.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.819
We offer a unique

00:36.862 --> 00:39.517
wealth management strategy
with consistent return

00:39.561 --> 00:41.302
over the course...

00:43.391 --> 00:44.479
Excuse us.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.920
- Kenneth, we're in a meeting.
- The FBI is here.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.443
- The FBI?
- They just

00:52.487 --> 00:54.054
showed up, and one
of them handed me

00:54.097 --> 00:56.056
this search warrant, and
now they're taking things.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.709
They're just
- taking them.
- Taking what?

00:57.753 --> 00:58.841
Everything.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.103
This says
they can seize

01:00.147 --> 01:02.888
transaction records
back ten years.

01:02.932 --> 01:05.456
- Dad.
- Everything's fine.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.849
Kenneth,
get Tennenbaum

01:06.892 --> 01:08.894
on the phone. We'll
sic the lawyers

01:08.938 --> 01:10.896
on them and
sort this out.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.637
I'll talk to him
in my office.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.293
Make it the
conference room.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.468
Yes, sir.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.136
It's like he just walked away.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.835
Just... left.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.315
He was a coward.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.055
A thief and a coward.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.883
I'm ashamed to call him
my father.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.931
The search warrant and raid
were to investigate allegations

02:28.974 --> 02:30.846
your father ran a Ponzi
scheme out of his business,

02:30.889 --> 02:32.239
is that right?

02:32.282 --> 02:33.979
It's now clear
that, for years,

02:34.023 --> 02:36.199
Tim's father pretended
to open accounts for clients,

02:36.243 --> 02:37.418
then stole their money.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.246
There were
no investments.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.291
- How much did he take?
- The accountants are

02:41.335 --> 02:43.206
still digging,
but looks like $300 million,

02:43.250 --> 02:45.034
give or take.
He didn't keep

02:45.077 --> 02:46.340
all of it.
A lot went to payouts

02:46.383 --> 02:47.558
to keep
the scheme going.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.212
That's quite a scheme.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.128
Another $160 million
is just... missing.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.999
Apparently, my
father hid it.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.218
No one knows where.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.785
Getaway money, I suspect.

02:56.828 --> 02:57.960
That's what we think.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.222
An emergency wallet

02:59.266 --> 03:00.702
in case he had to flee
the country.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.530
As it turned out, that's...

03:02.573 --> 03:03.879
not the exit he chose.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.533
So, the feds
don't have your dad,

03:05.576 --> 03:07.839
they don't have the money,
but they have you.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.233
The FBI arrested Tim last night.
The government

03:10.277 --> 03:12.279
is accusing him of conspiring
with his father.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.497
And you say you didn't?

03:13.541 --> 03:16.239
I don't say it.
I didn't.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.633
I had no idea
what my father was doing.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.417
Forgive me, but...

03:20.461 --> 03:22.941
you were partners.
You ran the firm together.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.640
He asked me to come work for him
after my mother died.

03:25.683 --> 03:26.815
He was lonely.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.252
I thought I was being
a good son.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.123
I handled clients,

03:31.167 --> 03:33.648
administration, but Dad
did all the investing.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.041
I was as fooled as anyone.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.783
You don't strike me as someone
who's easily fooled.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.264
You think I'm rich, so I deserve
whatever they throw at me.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.353
We didn't say that.
You understand

03:43.397 --> 03:45.225
I'm not rich anymore?

03:45.268 --> 03:47.139
The government seized
everything we own,

03:47.183 --> 03:50.317
put it in a fund for
my father's victims. I get that.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.710
They should
be compensated.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.712
But I shouldn't go to prison
for something

03:54.756 --> 03:56.236
I didn't do.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.672
Tim.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.718
Give us a minute.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.120
I've known Tim
since high school.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.818
I'm representing him despite the
fact I invested with his dad.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.038
Tim comes across
a little cold,

04:16.081 --> 04:18.083
but he's a good guy.
More to the point,

04:18.127 --> 04:19.563
he's not his father.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.478
The feds need somebody
to put in jail for this,

04:21.522 --> 04:22.871
and Tim's their best shot.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.699
He doesn't deserve it.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.178
Will you help?

04:26.222 --> 04:29.399
I am going to defer
to my partner.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.531
Marissa?

04:30.574 --> 04:33.490
If his assets have been seized,

04:33.534 --> 04:34.883
how does he pay?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.450
His wife's family's
footing the bill.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.625
The check will clear.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.757
Then I'm good.

04:39.801 --> 04:40.932
Bull?

04:40.976 --> 04:43.370
I guess we're in.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.459
- Thank you.
- For what?

04:45.502 --> 04:48.288
You said this would
be a partnership.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.202
- That felt like one.
- Well...

04:50.246 --> 04:51.987
sometimes I mean
what I say,

04:52.030 --> 04:53.771
believe it or not.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.208
Was that Timothy Darcourt
that just walked out or here?

04:56.252 --> 04:58.341
Are we taking
his case, guys?

04:58.385 --> 05:00.300
Yes, we are, but he
has his own attorney.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.258
Well, I'm not so sad
to be sitting this one out.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.174
Darcourt is not exactly
a popular name these days.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.349
Hello?

05:06.393 --> 05:07.568
Well, he's
pleading poverty,

05:07.611 --> 05:08.656
but did you see
that shirt?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.222
Must've been $500.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.224
- It was $800, actually.
- If he walks into court

05:12.268 --> 05:15.010
dressed like that, the jury's
gonna toss him in a tumbrel

05:15.053 --> 05:16.490
and roll him
to the guillotine.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.405
Ah, we can fix that.
We'll Sears him up a bit.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.710
Thank you.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.364
- We will be right there.
- Oh.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.975
I believe
I have made some rain.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.629
Oh. In what way?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.152
Well, there's
a law firm in Chicago

05:27.196 --> 05:28.676
that is looking to work
with an east coast partner

05:28.719 --> 05:30.765
on a civil action.
Their rep's name

05:30.808 --> 05:32.332
is Jacob Besarotti.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.724
I had a Zoom meeting
with him yesterday,

05:33.768 --> 05:35.247
and he's come in to follow up.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.510
I don't know the name,
but I like the idea

05:36.553 --> 05:38.294
of extending
our brand.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.340
Right. With a little effort, I
think we can establish ourselves

05:40.383 --> 05:42.385
as a national player. Hm.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.692
Is that the guy
you talked to?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.389
Yes, why?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.002
What are you doing?

05:51.046 --> 05:52.308
Hey, man.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.483
You lied your way in here?

05:53.527 --> 05:55.267
It's not like
you gave me a choice.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.834
Okay, we're not doing this.
You need to go right now.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.793
Okay, but what if
I don't want to?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.969
I don't care.
You're going, now.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.057
Make me.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.711
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.626
- Go ahead, make me. Come on.
- No. Don't. Don't touch me.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.975
What are you gonna do--
- show everyone how tough you are?
- Oh...

06:07.018 --> 06:08.585
Go ahead. Show everybody
how tough you are.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.065
I told you what would happen... I think you should.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.632
Show everybody how
big and tough you really are.

06:11.675 --> 06:12.850
I told you... Go ahead. You...
Ah, ah, ah!

06:16.506 --> 06:17.855
Bull! Bull!

06:17.899 --> 06:18.900
Bull, come on!

06:18.943 --> 06:20.902
- Come on!
- What?

06:22.991 --> 06:24.514
Is that Jake?

06:24.558 --> 06:25.689
You know him?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.169
Who's Jake?

06:29.214 --> 06:30.955
He's my brother.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.523
Hi.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.536
Oh, come on.
Are you kidding me right...

06:46.580 --> 06:48.146
You can't come in here
and humiliate my colleagues.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.626
- Oh, I'm humiliating you?
- Well, you come in here...

06:49.670 --> 06:51.236
This is exactly what you do,
every single time.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.108
I do it every single time?

06:53.151 --> 06:54.936
You can't take a joke
- every single time.
- Because I am not...

06:54.979 --> 06:56.894
The fight is not the point. Oh, I'm Jason Bull.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.287
Uh, my farts smell like books
and I got... You know what you do?

06:58.330 --> 07:00.028
O-Okay.
All right, all right, all right!

07:00.071 --> 07:01.421
Just stop it, just stop it.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.858
Just sit. Sit down. Sit.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.473
Do you always fight like this?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.127
- Yes.
- When he'll talk to me.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.650
Okay, well, it ends now.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
Jacob.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.524
I'm Izzy. Welcome.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.264
Jason's told me about youDo not believe...

07:19.308 --> 07:20.352
and I'm so glad
to finally meet.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.180
I don't care how it happened.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.052
Well, I'm sorry
I missed the wedding.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.273
Not that I got
invited, but...

07:28.317 --> 07:30.406
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.495
No, I'm here because you
didn't give me a choice.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
What do you mean?

07:34.062 --> 07:36.107
I have been here for a week.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.718
I text him, I call him,

07:37.761 --> 07:40.024
- and he's ghosting me.
- Is that true?

07:40.068 --> 07:43.375
I didn't call you because
I did not want to see you.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.681
Honestly, I kind
of knew that,

07:44.725 --> 07:45.639
so I took it as
a challenge, so...

07:45.682 --> 07:46.988
You are so ungrateful

07:47.031 --> 07:48.337
Here he is. I justand so manipulative.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.556
calmed down,
and he's giving it...

07:49.599 --> 07:51.427
Okay. We're not
doing this again.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.516
Jacob, tomorrow, you're gonna
come have dinner at our home

07:53.560 --> 07:54.996
because that's the way
I was raised.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.954
That's what you
do for family.

07:56.998 --> 08:00.001
It's the minimum you do.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.699
I would be delighted.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.528
Good.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.357
Okay. Well, I will
see you tomorrow.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.319
Do you have a problem with that?

08:14.363 --> 08:16.931
Oh, far be it for me to question

08:16.974 --> 08:19.107
the customs of the Colóns.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.504
How long has it actually been
since you two have spoken?

08:26.418 --> 08:29.030
13 years.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.162
Wh...

08:31.206 --> 08:32.555
What happened?

08:34.426 --> 08:36.037
He knows.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.737
Marissa?

08:40.781 --> 08:43.958
Hey. Look,
about the, um...

08:44.001 --> 08:46.351
Well, the lie
that I told you.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.789
I was just trying to get through
to my stupid brother, who,

08:48.832 --> 08:50.442
um...

08:50.486 --> 08:53.141
Anyway, it had nothing
to do with you,

08:53.184 --> 08:55.491
and I'm-I'm really sorry
that I got you involved.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.449
I don't need an apology from you

08:57.493 --> 08:59.277
or anything else,
for that matter.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.848
Real slick.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.068
Real slick, Jake.
<i>Okay, so Bull got into</i>

09:07.111 --> 09:10.593
a WWE SmackDown and nobody got
a video? What were you thinking?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.508
I'm a little disappointed,
I have to say.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.379
Yes, my brother came
to the office, and we fought.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.425
If you have any questions, don't
ask. I'm not answering them.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.601
Where are we with
the Darcourt case?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.995
Well, the, uh,
AUSA went to town.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.997
She filed a slew of
charges, including

09:23.040 --> 09:24.694
multiple counts of
fraud and tax evasion,

09:24.738 --> 09:26.653
down to some stupid misdemeanors.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.132
Well, the government is
gonna claim that Timothy

09:28.176 --> 09:30.395
was a conspirator
because of his father.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.875
We need to paint

09:31.919 --> 09:33.660
a counter-image to that.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.227
We need to characterize
him as someone

09:36.271 --> 09:37.881
who would never participate
in fraud, so,

09:37.925 --> 09:40.536
Danny, I need you to find us
some character witnesses,

09:40.580 --> 09:41.624
and, Taylor,

09:41.668 --> 09:43.060
I need you to keep
going through

09:43.104 --> 09:44.409
all the evidence.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.889
Anything that draws a line

09:45.933 --> 09:48.196
between Timothy and his father

09:48.239 --> 09:49.937
and what he was up to,
we need to know.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.460
Okay.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.635
What's the jury plan?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.550
We need people
who don't believe

09:54.594 --> 09:56.117
in guilt by association,

09:56.160 --> 09:59.163
who reject
collective responsibility.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.036
Self-disciplined,
self-reliant.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.211
Loners.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.908
How are you gonna identify them?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.128
"Hey, who hasn't been
out on a date recently?"

10:07.171 --> 10:09.130
I have a few ideas.

10:09.173 --> 10:12.046
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's talk about cats.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.569
- Cats?
- Mm-hmm.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.788
How many people here own cats?

10:14.831 --> 10:16.746
I don't mean one or two--

10:16.790 --> 10:18.182
a lot of cats.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.620
M-More than four?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.056
Six?

10:22.099 --> 10:23.231
<i>All right,</i> <i>
so, working theory here</i>

10:23.274 --> 10:25.276
is cat people
are loners?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.538
They keep to themselves

10:26.582 --> 10:28.236
and expect others
to do the same.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.977
I don't buy it.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.500
I have a cat.
I'm not a loner.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.590
Am I?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.637
Whatever.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.116
<i>You have ten cats?</i><i>Yes,</i>

10:39.160 --> 10:41.597
since Mr. Pickwick
and Buster Fuzzly died.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.817
And how does your significant
other feel about them?

10:43.860 --> 10:45.035
My what?

10:45.079 --> 10:46.428
Bingo.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.473
Your Honor,
this juror is acceptable

10:48.517 --> 10:49.823
to the defense.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.215
We have our cat person.
What's next?

10:51.259 --> 10:53.653
Jurors who reject
collective guilt.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.002
Here's a hypothetical.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
You're on a road trip
with a friend.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.483
It's your car,
but you're napping,

10:58.527 --> 11:00.790
your friend's driving, and
they get a speeding ticket.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.532
When you wake up, they say
you should split the ticket.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.882
Share the trip,
share the ticket. Should you?

11:05.926 --> 11:08.624
I guess it sounds fair.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.713
What about you, sir?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.672
No way. Not driving,

11:12.715 --> 11:14.761
not my ticket, not my problem.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.458
Works as a freelance proofreader,

11:16.501 --> 11:18.112
votes libertarian.
I like him.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.418
I mean, he'd be a bad friend,
but as a juror.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.769
Your Honor,
this juror's acceptable.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.032
Two down, ten to go.

11:25.075 --> 11:28.252
Timothy Darcourt said you're a
neighbor of his in the building.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.254
Sure, yeah, we've
known Tim for years.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.995
And you're on the
residents' council together?

11:32.039 --> 11:33.780
I am, yeah. Tim's been great.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.347
Well, we're looking for people
to testify on his behalf.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.827
I'm assuming
that's something

11:37.871 --> 11:39.481
you could do, given that
you know him so well?

11:39.524 --> 11:42.179
I'm so... Testify in court?

11:42.223 --> 11:43.877
That's usually
where it happens, yeah.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.575
Well, I don't...
I mean, um,

11:46.618 --> 11:48.055
there's a-there's
a lot of feeling

11:48.098 --> 11:50.013
about what Tim's father did.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.449
Some people we know lost money.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.929
Ah, well, like you said,

11:52.973 --> 11:54.844
that's what his father did,
not-not him.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.020
Yeah. I just... I don't want to
get in the middle of anything.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.369
I'm sorry.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.893
C'mon, Boots.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.286
Man, dog people are the worst.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.287
Hey.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.941
You a cop?

12:04.985 --> 12:07.204
What makes you think I am?

12:07.248 --> 12:08.902
You got that cop way
of standing.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.338
Like, wherever you are,
you got a right to be there.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.820
Sharp eye. What do you want?

12:13.863 --> 12:15.778
I overheard you mention
Timothy Darcourt.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.259
I know something about him that
might be of use to the police.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.000
Yeah? What's that?

12:20.043 --> 12:21.915
The night before the old man
took a dive off that building,

12:21.958 --> 12:24.047
Tim Darcourt called me
and asked if there's a way

12:24.091 --> 12:25.527
to get out of the building

12:25.570 --> 12:26.833
without going past
the security cameras.

12:26.876 --> 12:30.271
Paid me $500 to tell
him how to do it.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.794
Did he go out that night?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.753
What do you think?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.755
Timothy may have
been able to hide

12:35.798 --> 12:37.017
from the cameras
in his building,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.583
but once you're on the street,

12:38.627 --> 12:40.716
there's no
avoiding them complete...

12:40.760 --> 12:41.978
Wait. I think...

12:42.022 --> 12:43.240
Okay. There.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.068
That's Darcourt
at 69th and Madison

12:45.112 --> 12:46.417
a little after midnight.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.463
He's just standing there.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.291
That's very suspicious.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.945
Can you fast forward?

12:54.425 --> 12:56.079
Ah-hah.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.126
So, he got in the front seat.
He knows the driver,

12:59.169 --> 13:01.041
clearly.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.390
Can we see inside?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.131
Mm... Not here,
the angle's wrong,

13:04.174 --> 13:06.220
but there are traffic cams
up and down Madison.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.615
This is 35 seconds later,
a block north.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.923
That's the car,
there's Timothy and...

13:15.664 --> 13:18.058
Isn't that
his father driving?

13:18.101 --> 13:19.059
Yes, it is.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.974
He didn't say anything

13:21.017 --> 13:22.802
about a secret meeting
with his father, did he?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.849
He very much did not.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.155
So, what are
they up to?

13:28.198 --> 13:31.201
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.864
My father called me that night.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.432
He was frantic.
He said he had to see me,

13:44.475 --> 13:45.912
but no one could know
we were meeting.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.436
What did your father
say when you met?

13:48.479 --> 13:51.831
He confessed.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.877
The fraud, the Ponzi scheme.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.661
He said the FBI
was onto him, and that

13:56.705 --> 14:00.230
he would be arrested
in a few days.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.015
You know, the minute
he did that--

14:02.058 --> 14:04.931
I mean that minute--
you should've called the FBI,

14:04.974 --> 14:06.846
- called me.
- I wanted to.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.370
I told him that's
what I was going to do,

14:09.413 --> 14:11.589
but he was s...

14:11.633 --> 14:13.678
sobbing. He begged me.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.333
He said he needed a few days
to get things in order.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.421
I didn't know what to do.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.249
I said okay.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.037
He was my father.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.084
This completely undermines
our defense.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.173
Why?
Our whole argument

14:30.217 --> 14:32.523
is that you were ignorant
of the crime.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.221
I was.
No, he told you,

14:34.264 --> 14:36.223
and you hid
the knowledge.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.225
- For a couple of hours.
- Doesn't matter.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.749
The prosecution will say if you
lied about a couple of hours,

14:40.792 --> 14:44.013
you could just as easily lie
about days, weeks, years.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.233
Your credibilityis shot.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.757
I can't put him
on the stand now.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.498
One thing I don't get--

14:50.541 --> 14:53.196
your father kept his scheme
going for a long time

14:53.240 --> 14:55.677
by being
supremely cautious.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.940
Calling you,
seeing you--

14:57.984 --> 15:00.508
that's a risk he didn't
have to take. Why did he do it?

15:02.684 --> 15:05.252
He said he wanted me
to hear about it from him.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.212
And he wanted
to give me something.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.173
What did he give you?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.699
He gave him a picture?

15:17.742 --> 15:18.874
Yup.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.355
This was from a family vacation

15:21.398 --> 15:23.096
that, uh, they took
when Tim was a kid.

15:23.139 --> 15:26.055
Milton said that he gave it
to him to remind him

15:26.099 --> 15:28.057
of happier times, and he said,

15:28.101 --> 15:31.495
"This is the only real gift
I have to give."

15:31.539 --> 15:33.193
Well, that's just weird.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.977
It's not even a good picture. No.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.457
It's not.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.807
What is it Fitzgerald said
about the rich?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.852
They're different
than you and me.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.245
Mm-hmm. Yup. They're weird.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.377
What are you doing?

15:43.420 --> 15:46.249
Milton Darcourt was a thief.

15:46.293 --> 15:49.078
Probably a sociopath, but...

15:49.122 --> 15:51.559
he was not sentimental.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.301
Hello.
What is that?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.782
Taylor?

15:57.826 --> 15:59.915
I think it's a Bitcoin wallet.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.308
Uh, more, please?

16:01.351 --> 16:03.005
A hard drive
you can keep Bitcoin on.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.485
It's actually
the safest way to store it.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.573
Milton Darcourt

16:05.616 --> 16:07.531
tucked away $160 million.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.272
You think he hid it there?

16:09.316 --> 16:11.318
I wouldn't be surprised.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.102
Can you get into that thing?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.235
Not without a password, and
smart money says the only person

16:15.278 --> 16:17.367
who knew the password
was Milton Darcourt.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.586
What about Timothy?

16:18.629 --> 16:20.022
Uh, we could ask,

16:20.066 --> 16:20.980
but he didn't even know
about the wallet.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.199
Can you... hack in?

16:23.243 --> 16:25.288
I could try, but if you
enter the password wrong

16:25.332 --> 16:28.683
too many times, it wipes
the drive. Goodbye Bitcoin.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.163
Well, see if you can
get in there without destroying

16:30.206 --> 16:31.599
$160 million.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.644
Anything else impossible
you'd like done?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.559
Now, we are not talking

16:35.603 --> 16:38.432
about this with anyone.
Whoa, ho.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.216
That's stolen property,

16:40.260 --> 16:42.088
and if the judge finds out
that we withheld it,

16:42.131 --> 16:44.220
we could be sanctioned
and prosecuted.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.266
Yeah, if I found the doorman,
the cops will, too.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.789
There's no way they don't
catch on to this eventually.

16:47.832 --> 16:50.009
We'll deal with the doorman

16:50.052 --> 16:52.054
if the cops find him.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.056
As for that drive,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.493
it's only stolen property
if the money's on there.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.322
Don't we all think
that the money is on that?

16:59.366 --> 17:00.497
Well, there might be nothing on there,

17:00.541 --> 17:02.369
or something

17:02.412 --> 17:04.936
other than the stolen money.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.069
We might suspect
the money's on there,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.767
but we don't know it, so...

17:09.811 --> 17:10.942
no problem.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.161
Yeah.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.081
Am I the only person who still
thinks there's a problem?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.561
Mr. Mesry,

17:20.604 --> 17:22.432
as Milton Darcourt's
executive assistant,

17:22.476 --> 17:25.305
you conspired with him
in the fraud he perpetrated.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.002
In fact, you're testifying here

17:27.046 --> 17:28.786
as part of a plea agreement,
isn't that correct?

17:28.830 --> 17:31.093
Yes. I would prepare

17:31.137 --> 17:32.834
fake financial reports

17:32.877 --> 17:34.488
that we sent to the clients
to make it look like

17:34.531 --> 17:36.098
we had invested their money.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.100
So, in pursuing
the firm's legitimate work

17:38.144 --> 17:41.103
and the fraud, you spent a lot
of time with Milton Darcourt?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.452
- Yes.
- Would you say

17:42.496 --> 17:44.802
you spent the most
time with him?

17:44.846 --> 17:45.803
No.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.370
Who did?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.633
His son, Timothy Darcourt.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.506
They met every morning
for at least an hour,

17:52.549 --> 17:55.204
spoke easily
a dozen times every day.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.859
When Timothy Darcourt
arrived at the firm,

17:57.902 --> 17:59.904
did Milton Darcourt
give you a directive?

18:01.254 --> 18:04.344
He told me Timothy
was to see everything he did.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.260
He wanted Timothy to know
every facet of the business.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.961
Every facet.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.789
No further questions.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.881
We're in trouble.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.668
Pearlander's saying
the right thing, but...

18:24.712 --> 18:26.017
none of it's landing.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.584
Why not?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.238
Well, he keeps telling the
jury there's no evidence

18:29.282 --> 18:31.458
Timothy knew what
was going on,

18:31.501 --> 18:33.808
but their instinct is
telling them he had to know.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.462
Well, didn't he?

18:35.505 --> 18:36.724
See? This is what
I'm dealing with.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.991
For a minute, I thought you were
gonna leave me out here.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.428
Mm. I wouldn't do that
to my neighbors.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.430
- Wine. Nice.
- Yeah.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.084
Who says it's for you?

18:51.260 --> 18:52.827
When our parents

18:52.870 --> 18:54.742
split up, and they
asked us kids who we wanted

18:54.785 --> 18:56.831
to stay with, he
and Jennifer said Mom.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.746
I said Dad.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.574
Why?

19:00.617 --> 19:02.358
I... It just didn't
seem right to me

19:02.402 --> 19:03.707
that he had to
be by himself.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.232
That was kind of you. Wasn't it?

19:08.016 --> 19:09.757
This paella is delicious.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.369
Yes, very deft hand
with the saffron.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.241
Thank you.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.373
So, what are you doing now?

19:17.417 --> 19:19.549
Just looking
for projects to finance.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.812
I'm an opportunity
investor, like our dad.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.336
Ah, is that what
you think Dad did--

19:23.379 --> 19:24.815
opportunity investing?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.513
Yeah.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.819
I think that he identified
what people needed,

19:28.863 --> 19:30.430
and then he raised money
to build it.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.346
He was a glorified con man
with a realtor's license.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.609
You're not that different
from Dad. You know that, right?

19:35.652 --> 19:36.784
Yeah, we're peas in a pod.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.916
Yeah, more than
you think.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.005
Do your clients know
you failed the bar twice?

19:43.051 --> 19:45.184
I have three PhDs,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.838
and I never wanted
to be an attorney.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.971
I own a trial
consulting firm, Jake.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.147
So, you're a glorified con man,

19:52.191 --> 19:53.931
but with a psychology degree.

19:55.716 --> 19:56.978
What do you want?

19:57.021 --> 19:58.371
Jason.

19:58.414 --> 20:01.417
You wouldn't come here
just to say hi.

20:01.461 --> 20:04.377
There's always an angle,
there's an ask. What is it?

20:04.420 --> 20:07.031
Well, I wanted to meet
Izzy and Astrid.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.772
Um...

20:10.426 --> 20:13.342
And I want to talk about
the land in New Hampshire.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.257
Mm.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.867
You haven't built
anything on it.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.043
Right? It's just,
it's sitting there.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.784
It's doing nothing.
I think we should sell it.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.439
And why do you want to do that?

20:23.483 --> 20:26.268
Well, I'd like my piece of it.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.966
There's a geothermal energy
project in Utah

20:29.010 --> 20:30.577
that I am circling,

20:30.620 --> 20:32.187
and I would just love
to put some money into it.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.275
No.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.581
What, no?

20:34.624 --> 20:36.278
Like, no, we can't discuss it?

20:36.322 --> 20:37.627
That's right. We can't.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.194
Jason, we can.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.370
Jennifer left me her interest.
I control it,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.851
and as far as I'm concerned,
that is family property.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.461
I would like to remind you
that I'm also family.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.854
I don't care.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.683
It's the last connection
we have to Jennifer.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.163
It's the last thing we shared,
and I am not gonna sell it

20:52.207 --> 20:55.471
so you can go waste money
on some cockamamie scheme.

20:56.777 --> 21:00.346
Cockamamie scheme. Really?

21:00.389 --> 21:02.130
Yeah.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.745
You know, Jason,
all you had to do was say no.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.359
You didn't have to
be a dick about it.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.709
Actually, I...
I have to use the bathroom.

21:15.752 --> 21:18.407
Oh, um, yeah, there's...

21:18.451 --> 21:20.757
there's one in our bedroom.

21:31.681 --> 21:32.639
You're fine.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.467
Okay.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.214
I'm gonna go.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.260
No, please,
please stay.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.480
Thank you, but I-I...
I really should.

21:47.523 --> 21:48.785
I think I should go.

21:48.829 --> 21:49.786
What's the matter?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.353
What? Nothing. I just...

21:51.397 --> 21:52.789
No, no, you're sweating

21:52.833 --> 21:54.617
and your breathing's elevated.
What's going on?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.053
Nothing, okay? It's...

21:56.097 --> 21:57.577
Can you please...
It's nothing. I'm going.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.535
Hey.

21:59.579 --> 22:00.928
What's in your pocket?

22:00.971 --> 22:02.843
- There's nothing. Okay?
- There's something

22:02.886 --> 22:04.323
in your pocket. Show me.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.280
There's nothing.
It's none of your business.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.977
Empty your pocket now.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.675
Jason, what're you doing?
Would you get off my back?

22:08.718 --> 22:09.719
Jake, you're not leaving hereI'm just trying to go.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.069
until you empty your pocket!

22:22.819 --> 22:24.778
That...

22:24.821 --> 22:27.215
That's mine.
That was in my jewelry case.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.218
Jake?

22:31.219 --> 22:32.568
You win.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.484
What do you mean?

22:35.528 --> 22:37.356
What do you think it means?
It means I'm...

22:37.399 --> 22:39.488
I'm the idiot.

22:39.532 --> 22:40.924
I'm the screwup brother

22:40.968 --> 22:42.448
you always thought
I would be, right?

22:45.146 --> 22:46.365
You happy?

23:03.860 --> 23:05.209
What just happened?

23:05.253 --> 23:07.647
I don't know.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.522
Has he ever done anything
like this before?

23:13.566 --> 23:15.916
Well, I mean, he's
asked for money.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.920
Jake's always
got some...

23:19.963 --> 23:21.922
business project going,

23:21.965 --> 23:24.054
some scam, or whatever.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.578
Well, is that
what got between you--

23:25.621 --> 23:27.188
he didn't pay you back
for something?

23:27.231 --> 23:29.408
Mm...

23:29.451 --> 23:31.671
Not exactly.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.542
Long time ago, he asked
for some money, and...

23:36.284 --> 23:38.242
...and I gave it him,
but I told him

23:38.286 --> 23:39.853
not to ask our sister.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.466
Jennifer's husband...

23:44.510 --> 23:47.077
was treating her worse,
and I knew that

23:47.121 --> 23:49.602
if she gave Jake the
money, that he would...

23:51.168 --> 23:52.996
...react badly.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.826
And I told Jake

23:56.870 --> 23:59.481
not to go to her,
but he did.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.265
And, of course, she
gave him the money

24:01.309 --> 24:04.747
because she was the softest
touch in the world.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.358
And her husband responded
the way I thought he would.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.275
Is that when he killed her?

24:11.319 --> 24:12.538
No.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.237
No, but it was
bad enough.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.721
I just didn't want to talk to
Jake after that, you know?

24:24.245 --> 24:26.508
But I've never seen him
the way he was tonight.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.815
And, before, when he

24:28.858 --> 24:30.773
would ask for money,
he would wheedle

24:30.817 --> 24:33.036
and lie and cajole, but...

24:34.821 --> 24:37.127
...he didn't steal.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.695
He was unreliable, but...

24:39.739 --> 24:41.175
never a thief.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.657
Well, you know what that means.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.572
- He's desperate.
- Mm.

24:46.615 --> 24:49.009
Question is, why?

24:54.275 --> 24:55.450
Marissa, what is it?

24:55.494 --> 24:56.625
I just got a call

24:56.669 --> 24:58.322
from Pearlander.
The AUSA

24:58.366 --> 25:00.629
sent him a late update
to the witness list.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.152
She's calling the doorman.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.328
Danny was right.
The cops found him.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.808
If the doorman testifies,

25:05.852 --> 25:08.768
Pearlander has to put Timothy
on the stand

25:08.811 --> 25:10.552
to explain what
he was doing that night.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.772
Yeah, then the AUSA's
gonna point out

25:12.815 --> 25:14.643
that he knew about the fraud
and he kept it a secret.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.472
And the jury's worst suspicions
about him will be confirmed.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.734
Ignorance isn't
a defense anymore,

25:18.778 --> 25:21.302
so we are going
to have to assert

25:21.345 --> 25:22.782
something positive,

25:22.825 --> 25:25.567
something that will
show Timothy in a new light,

25:25.611 --> 25:27.438
and get the jury to acquit him.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.658
And what would that be, exactly?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.660
Well, if Timothy announced
that he had found

25:31.704 --> 25:34.010
$160 million in his father's
Bitcoin wallet

25:34.054 --> 25:36.970
and gave it to something like
the victim's compensation fund,

25:37.013 --> 25:39.929
I think that would
go a long way with the jury.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.670
Don't you think, Taylor?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.280
Oh, how's it coming
with the password?

25:45.021 --> 25:46.806
Timothy doesn't know
the password.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.547
I've gone through
all the evidence seized

25:48.590 --> 25:49.852
from Milton Darcourt.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.462
There's no sign
he wrote it down.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.595
I know it's a 14-character
string of letters,

25:53.639 --> 25:54.814
of which there are a bazillion

25:54.857 --> 25:56.598
combinations.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.079
We are asking for
a 24-hour continuance,

25:59.122 --> 26:02.212
which means you have until
tomorrow to find the password.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.084
Find it, please.

26:05.476 --> 26:08.567
He knows I only get
three tries, right?

26:13.746 --> 26:16.357
I hear the
cops found the doorman.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.707
Now, I'm supposed to say,
"I hate to say I told you so,"

26:18.751 --> 26:20.448
but the truth
is I really enjoy it.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.058
- Told you so.
- Yeah.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.407
I need you to do
something for me.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.888
What's that?

26:25.932 --> 26:27.803
I need you to find someone.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.038
Yeah?

26:45.081 --> 26:46.692
It's me.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.650
Get lost.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.000
- Open up, I want to talk.
- No.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.262
Jake.

26:54.787 --> 26:58.138
I'm sorry about dinner.
I was being a...

27:00.009 --> 27:01.881
I apologize.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.623
How many times
have you heard me do that?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.364
Just open the door.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.458
What happened?

27:14.502 --> 27:16.330
Tripped and fell.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.853
On what?

27:17.897 --> 27:20.334
Two guys
with their fists cocked.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.952
Okay.

27:29.996 --> 27:33.173
You know that geothermal
energy project?

27:33.216 --> 27:34.827
Yeah.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.785
Well, I already borrowed
some money and invested in it.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.570
But it turns out "geothermal"
derives from the Latin

27:39.614 --> 27:42.486
for "no energy."

27:42.530 --> 27:45.011
Nothing happened.
Money disappeared.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.186
Now the guy I borrowed it from
wants it back,

27:46.229 --> 27:48.971
so, um, last night,

27:49.015 --> 27:51.757
him and his guys
found me and were, uh,

27:51.800 --> 27:53.802
not too happy about it.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.412
So...

27:56.413 --> 27:58.024
Jake.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.852
Why didn't you tell me?

27:59.895 --> 28:01.114
I just...

28:02.550 --> 28:04.073
I couldn't.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.645
I know that you're still angry
about Jennifer.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.388
And you were right, man,
you were right.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.477
I should not have taken
the money from her, but...

28:18.435 --> 28:20.916
...you just, you can't
act like you're the guardian

28:20.960 --> 28:22.483
of her memory, or something.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.311
Everyone acts like
you're this big hero

28:24.354 --> 28:28.054
because you put her name
on the building, but...

28:28.097 --> 28:30.317
I'm the one who she called
when things went bad

28:30.360 --> 28:31.840
with the scumbag husband.

28:31.884 --> 28:34.625
I'm the one
who told her to leave.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.370
I-I did, I begged her.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.895
I know.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.246
And the truth is...

28:48.204 --> 28:51.338
The truth is I've always
been angry at myself

28:51.381 --> 28:52.687
about what happened to Jennifer,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.167
about not being able
to help her.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.691
And I think that...

28:56.735 --> 28:58.171
over the years,
I've dealt with that anger

28:58.214 --> 29:01.000
by putting some of it
on you, and...

29:01.043 --> 29:03.089
that's not fair to you.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.093
I am sorry.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.578
I just miss her.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.755
I do, too.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.804
So, who do you
owe this money to?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.328
His name is Mitch DeVries.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.504
Runs a poker room.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.290
How much we talking?

29:30.333 --> 29:31.813
$86,000.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.556
Okay.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.820
Let's... get you out of here.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.735
You can come and stay
at our place.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.303
Seriously?

29:43.346 --> 29:46.088
It'll give us a chance to...

29:46.132 --> 29:49.178
really talk about
this DeVries guy.

29:50.397 --> 29:53.269
Okay.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.013
Hey, Jason?

30:00.537 --> 30:02.235
Thanks.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.850
This is everything Timothy

30:08.894 --> 30:10.025
gave me about his father.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.941
Great. None of these
have 14 letters.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.813
Milton has to
choose a password,

30:14.856 --> 30:16.858
he knows he's about
to be arrested.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.905
It has to be something he's
100% sure he will not forget.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.341
Milton's older. Analog.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.864
He's gonna want
to keep it simple.

30:22.908 --> 30:26.737
Maybe it's...

30:32.961 --> 30:35.746
Ooh, that's pretty simple.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.052
Do you want to try it?

30:37.096 --> 30:39.315
Yes.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.803
Oh, I knew I shouldn't
have done that.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.587
- It was your idea.
- I know.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.253
Don't you think, if somebody
wanted to give a picture

31:04.297 --> 31:08.170
to remember him by, he would
choose a better one than this?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.693
Why, you think the password
has something to do

31:09.737 --> 31:11.304
- with the picture?
- Well,

31:11.347 --> 31:12.958
he did tape the
wallet to it.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.960
And look, there's a
sign behind them.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.744
"Morse State Park."

31:18.006 --> 31:20.008
14 letters.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.271
Try it.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.887
When you feel faint, do you put
your head between your legs

31:28.930 --> 31:31.019
- or do you blow into a paper bag?
- Wait,

31:31.063 --> 31:32.891
there's a shadow here.
Do you see it?

31:32.934 --> 31:34.109
Yeah. What does that
have to do with anything?

31:34.153 --> 31:36.198
I am texting Timothy.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.766
- Why?
- I have this picture of my aunt

31:38.809 --> 31:40.768
and my grandmother from a
trip they took to New York.

31:40.811 --> 31:43.031
My grandmother asked this
stranger to take the picture,

31:43.075 --> 31:44.598
turned out to be Paul McCartney.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.121
We call it the McCartney photo.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.907
I don't think Paul McCartney
has 14 letters.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.952
No. I just wonder

31:50.996 --> 31:53.868
if the password is the name
of the photographer.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.478
The shadow. Someone
who's part of the picture

31:55.522 --> 31:57.872
[phone vibrates]but who isn't in it.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.961
Timothy says the picture
was taken by a friend

32:00.005 --> 32:04.444
of his father's named
Annette McCracken.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.098
No. Too many letters.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.448
No, but everyone called
her Netty. N-E-T-T-Y.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.929
She went with him on the trip
and died in a car crash

32:10.972 --> 32:12.234
on the way home.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.975
Netty McCracken.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.673
14 letters.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.501
Netty?

32:18.545 --> 32:20.373
Netty.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.562
And when you turned

32:35.605 --> 32:37.651
over the photo, did you have
any idea the Bitcoin wallet

32:37.694 --> 32:39.087
was hidden behind it?

32:39.131 --> 32:41.742
None. I was staggered.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.483
What was discovered
on the wallet?

32:43.526 --> 32:45.311
Objection, Your Honor. This
is irrelevant to the issue

32:45.354 --> 32:47.226
of Mr. Darcourt's
guilt or innocence.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.749
I'll allow it.

32:48.792 --> 32:49.837
He better allow it.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.231
Is there a chance
he wouldn't allow it?

32:52.274 --> 32:53.884
Mm, small chance.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.364
Nobody told me that.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.845
Ladies, you're missing
the big finish.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.851
We found $163 million

33:03.894 --> 33:05.853
my father had stored there.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
We've turned it over
to the police,

33:09.335 --> 33:11.119
obviously, and we're
working to get it

33:11.163 --> 33:13.121
into the fund compensating

33:13.165 --> 33:16.777
my father's victims
as quickly as possible.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.391
No further questions.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.393
You want to know
how the jury's feeling?

33:24.437 --> 33:26.874
I don't need to.
I can see 'em.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.746
Thank you, Marissa.
Thank you, Taylor.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.624
Hey. How's it going
in jury land?

33:37.667 --> 33:40.409
They're good.
Jury's deliberating.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.803
You feel optimistic, or...

33:42.846 --> 33:44.457
I do. Why do you ask?

33:44.500 --> 33:47.895
I was just, you know,
trying to show an interest.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.288
You never show an interest.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.985
Hey.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.813
Checked out Mitch DeVries.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.076
NYPD has an eye on him
for loan-sharking,

33:55.120 --> 33:57.644
but they've never been able
to put together a case.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.473
If you want to talk about what
he did to you, they'll listen.

34:00.516 --> 34:04.042
Oh, I do not want to talk
to the police, thank you, ma'am.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.782
From I've heard about you,
I'm not surprised.

34:05.826 --> 34:09.177
So what about the poker
game DeVries runs?

34:09.221 --> 34:11.701
Nothing special.
But rumor is he cheats.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.139
Excellent. Let's
go talk to him.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.531
Want me to tag along?

34:15.575 --> 34:17.403
No, I think we
can handle it.

34:17.446 --> 34:19.622
You sure? He's got
a pretty bad reputation.

34:19.666 --> 34:22.103
That's what
I'm counting on.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.731
♪ But what I got

34:41.775 --> 34:43.211
♪ I got

34:43.255 --> 34:47.041
♪ Ain't gonna lose it no more

34:49.478 --> 34:51.132
♪ Ain't got this...

34:51.176 --> 34:52.742
Are you Mitch DeVries?

34:52.786 --> 34:54.657
♪ Ain't got that...

34:54.701 --> 34:56.181
Yeah.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.531
My name's Jason Bull.
This is my brother, Jake.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.402
I believe you two
know each other.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.534
Can we talk?

35:01.577 --> 35:03.275
Okay.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.407
It's come to my attention that
my brother owes you some money,

35:05.451 --> 35:08.149
and I... I would like
to make good on that.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.020
I was thinking maybe
we could do a payment plan,

35:10.064 --> 35:11.152
and in installments,

35:11.196 --> 35:12.936
I can guarantee it.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.677
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

35:14.721 --> 35:16.940
That's not how this works.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.855
Yeah, I had a feeling,

35:18.899 --> 35:21.423
but I thought I'd just
throw it out there.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.599
I guess that brings me to
the second possibility,

35:23.643 --> 35:24.992
which is I go to the NYPD

35:25.035 --> 35:26.820
and tell them about
your loan-sharking.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.649
I hear they'd be
very interested in that.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.305
You don't want to do that.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.220
Yeah, it wasn't really our
number-one choice either,

35:35.263 --> 35:37.918
but, again-- possibilities.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.703
Which brings me
to the third option.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.750
You and I sit down
and we play a little poker.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.753
I'll put $172,000
on the table-- double

35:46.796 --> 35:48.450
what Jake owes you.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.279
You win, you walk away
with all of it.

35:51.323 --> 35:54.021
I win, and Jake walks away...

35:54.064 --> 35:56.066
clean.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.504
How do I know your money's good?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.941
Ah. Good question, Mitch.

36:00.984 --> 36:04.379
I brought a certified check.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.729
Better than a suitcase
full of cash.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.298
No poker.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.344
Blackjack.

36:12.387 --> 36:16.130
One hand. No tears.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.132
No blackjack, okay?
That's just luck.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.438
It's mostly luck.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.440
No, it's-it's
all luck, okay?

36:21.483 --> 36:23.311
You can't read his plays,
you can't see his tells,

36:23.355 --> 36:24.791
- and he cheats.
- I g...

36:24.834 --> 36:26.358
I got this.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.752
Okay.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.800
Blackjack. I like it.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.585
On one condition.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.283
Fresh deck.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.459
♪ Ain't gonna lose.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.845
Hit me.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.765
All right, hold.
You don't want to bust.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.897
He didn't recheck his card,

37:27.941 --> 37:29.769
which means he's got
a high one under there.

37:31.423 --> 37:32.641
All right.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.862
Again.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.003
Stay.

Show.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.448
Twenty.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.973
Twenty.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.280
That's a nice number.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.634
I like 21.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.466
You...

38:14.509 --> 38:16.859
don't want to do that.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.296
Well, that's my money.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.646
That's <i>my</i> money.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.783
Oh, I see.

38:29.437 --> 38:32.397
Well, you can take it
if you want to.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.399
I can't stop you.

38:34.442 --> 38:38.011
But you really
want to do that?

38:38.054 --> 38:39.926
Because if you do,

38:39.969 --> 38:41.884
everyone will know

38:41.928 --> 38:43.538
what you really are.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.715
A cheat.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.160
No tears.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.690
And don't touch my brother.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.572
Have you reached a verdict?

39:17.616 --> 39:19.966
We have, Your Honor.

39:20.009 --> 39:23.317
On counts one through seven,
we find the defendant

39:23.361 --> 39:24.971
not guilty.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.843
And count eight?

39:27.887 --> 39:30.803
On count eight,
misdemeanor criminal possession

39:30.846 --> 39:34.241
of stolen property,
we find the defendant guilty.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.722
Very well. I thank you
for your service.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.550
The jury having
rendered its verdict,

39:38.593 --> 39:41.379
we will meet again in six weeks
from today for sentencing.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.076
Court's adjourned.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.686
Tim.

39:44.730 --> 39:45.905
Look happy. We won.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.602
They found me guilty.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.343
A misdemeanor. It's nothing.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.172
You'll serve no time.
This is great, trust me.

39:52.215 --> 39:54.392
- Thank you.
- You bet. Thank you.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.613
I told them that I didn't know
he was stealing.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.659
Under the statute,
you can be found guilty

40:00.702 --> 40:02.269
of criminal possession

40:02.312 --> 40:04.445
if the jury thinks
you should have known.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.447
I didn't know what was going on.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.319
You didn't know
or you didn't want to know?

40:10.930 --> 40:13.411
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

40:14.847 --> 40:19.199
I think what the jury
is trying to say is that...

40:19.242 --> 40:21.941
your family is your family.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.551
They're a part of you,

Uh, don't be startled--
your brother's in your office.

40:32.995 --> 40:35.781
Oh, I'm surprised you let him in
after what happened last time.

40:35.824 --> 40:39.001
Oh, he asked politely.
Besides, there's a betting pool.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.742
I got ten bucks says
he pins you this time.

40:43.832 --> 40:46.008

40:46.052 --> 40:47.793
Yeah, it's comfy.

Yeah, it is. Out.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.927
