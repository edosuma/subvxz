00:08.310 --> 00:10.510
Hey, guys!
Prepare to be blown away.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.740
Is there a hurricave coming?

00:13.340 --> 00:14.710
Time to take emergency measures!

00:16.610 --> 00:18.350
What are you doing?

00:18.380 --> 00:21.520
It took me two hours to give
my hair this windswept look.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.520
I cannot have it ruined by actual wind.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.490
Well, there's no hurricane.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.330
Other than a hurricane of entertainment.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.430
Check out this animated film I made.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.600
Ooh, I love cartoons.

00:35.630 --> 00:38.530
I've watched over 70,000 and kept a log.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.480
How does that tell us which
cartoons you've watched?

00:45.510 --> 00:48.410
It doesn't. I just told you two
interesting things about me.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.480
One, that I've watched a lot of cartoons,

00:50.510 --> 00:52.750
and two, that I've kept a log.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.320
Try to keep up.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.350
You guys are supposed to be prodigies.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.390
So? What did you
guys "think"?

01:37.490 --> 01:40.430
I think I would have
preferred the hurricane.

01:44.270 --> 01:49.570
Well... I liked the font
you used at the end.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.680
Not me. I hated everything.
Including the font.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.340
Helvetica? Really?

01:56.750 --> 02:00.420
Congratulations!
You made me hate cartoons.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.490
So, you didn't like anything about it?

02:07.420 --> 02:10.560
Well, I thought the art was well drawn,

02:10.590 --> 02:15.430
but maybe you could try doing
something more relatable.

02:15.470 --> 02:17.330
Find some inspiration from your life.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.270
They say write what you know.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.500
They also say an apple a
day keeps the doctor away,

02:21.540 --> 02:25.340
but we all know that's not true.

02:25.410 --> 02:28.380
Hey, I told you, I don't need
those counseling sessions!

Oh! I've got to
take this, honey bunny.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.240
Dude, your girlfriend is
way out of your league.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.280
I know! Isn't it great?

03:34.550 --> 03:37.350
Aren't you worried about losing her?

03:37.380 --> 03:39.350
Every guy here is drooling over her.

03:41.490 --> 03:44.190
Wacky's not drooling over Vanessa.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.320
He's drooling over her.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.260
I'm not talking about Wacky.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.660
You better keep her away from other guys.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.500
Myself included.

03:57.530 --> 04:01.570
Because once a lady
feasts her eyes on this...

04:01.610 --> 04:03.640
There's little I can do to fight them off.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.580
Nice of you to throw
Fletcher a premiere party.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.420
How'd you get the paparazzi to show up?

04:23.230 --> 04:25.260
Oh. That's not paparazzi.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.230
I wanted to make this feel
like a real premiere,

04:27.260 --> 04:29.400
so I told these tourists that
this was Fisherman's Wharf.

04:34.370 --> 04:38.510
A shark's eyes are like a doll's eyes.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.220
Welcome to the premiere
of Fletcher's new web show.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.520
I haven't seen it yet,
but Fletcher's mom has,

04:50.550 --> 04:53.360
and she says,

04:53.390 --> 04:57.560
"Put that art nonsense down and
go kick a ball or something."

05:01.500 --> 05:03.400
All right, well, let's
get on with the show.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.350
Hey, Asia, want to have a picnic?

05:17.380 --> 05:19.480
Oh, Sketcher, I'd love to have a picnic

05:19.520 --> 05:23.150
with a smokin' hot fire ant like you!

05:23.190 --> 05:26.520
What the anthill?
Why did you guys leave the colony?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.290
Did you lose my pheromone trail?

05:32.300 --> 05:35.300
We're trying to have lunch, Pimento.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.370
Don't worry, I'll get rid of her.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.500
You hungry, Pimento?

05:38.540 --> 05:42.510
Ooh, I hope it's egg salad.
That's my favorite.

05:42.540 --> 05:46.310
Fascinating tidbit about egg salad...

05:46.340 --> 05:48.580
The pungent aroma is caused
by hydrogen sulfide gas,

05:48.610 --> 05:50.550
released when...
Ow!

05:50.580 --> 05:52.620
I think that sandwich bit me back.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.630
Wow, that's a big spoon.
Why is it made of glass?

06:02.660 --> 06:05.230
Oh, it's a magnifying glass.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.460
Fascinating tidbit, magnifying
glasses use convex lenses

06:08.500 --> 06:10.600
of various focal lengths to...

06:10.630 --> 06:12.200
Is anyone else hot?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.210
People seem to like it, huh?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.420
Are you crazy?

06:29.450 --> 06:31.490
The whole thing makes fun of Olive!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.420
You made her an annoying,

06:33.460 --> 06:37.160
fact-spouting blabber mouth
that irritates everybody.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.560
You told me to write what I know.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.260
Nailed it.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.530
She's going to be furious.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.600
Hey, Fletcher!

06:46.270 --> 06:47.540
About that Pimento character...

06:49.270 --> 06:52.210
Hilarious!

06:52.240 --> 06:54.340
I totally know people like her!

07:00.350 --> 07:03.220
Hey, girls!
Welcome to Beauty Club!

07:03.290 --> 07:04.650
Where you'll learn to look your best,

07:04.690 --> 07:08.260
even if you'll never achieve this.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.600
Are you sure you're okay hanging
out with all these girls?

07:14.630 --> 07:18.170
Of course.
What could be more fun?

07:18.200 --> 07:21.540
Certainly not sitting behind
home plate at the Giants game.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.480
Cameron?
This is Beauty Club.

07:27.510 --> 07:29.310
Troll Club meets under the bridge.

07:32.550 --> 07:37.520
Okay. Today, we'll be doing a
special hair removal treatment

07:37.550 --> 07:41.590
using the Panamanian tree snail.

07:44.490 --> 07:46.400
As the snails crawl up your legs,

07:46.430 --> 07:47.560
their slime dissolves the hair,

07:47.600 --> 07:49.570
leaving your legs silky smooth.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.340
It sounds gross, but trust
me, they do wonders.

07:53.370 --> 07:56.440
Juliette looked like a yak
before she started snailing.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.520
Cameron, if you're going to be in
Beauty Club, you have to participate.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.430
It tickles!
It tickles! Ohh!

08:24.270 --> 08:25.600
What? What's the matter?

08:36.309 --> 08:39.620
Fletcher, look.
I made a rat trap sandwich.

08:39.679 --> 08:42.380
No! Are you
out of your mind?

08:42.419 --> 08:45.250
What? I saw it on TV
so I know it's okay.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.400
I don't get it. All morning, people
have been pointing and laughing at me.

08:56.430 --> 09:00.170
Uh, that's just the new dance craze,

09:00.200 --> 09:01.670
the "Point Laugh."

09:11.580 --> 09:15.320
Ooh, Olive, will you sign
my Pimento poster?

09:15.350 --> 09:17.120
Why would you want my autograph on that?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.490
Uh, because...

09:19.520 --> 09:21.220
Oh, Gibson. Here,
have a sandwich.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.390
Oh, thank you.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.300
I think that sandwich bit me back.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.470
To answer your question,

09:30.500 --> 09:35.470
I want your autograph because
the character is based on you.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.470
You are Pimento.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.280
Pimento is you.

09:41.310 --> 09:42.610
What the heck?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.450
No, you're saying it wrong.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.150
Say, "What the anthill?"

09:47.180 --> 09:49.590
Ooh! Tell us a fascinating
tidbit about anthills.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.220
They're not fascinating tidbits!

09:51.250 --> 09:52.490
They're interesting factoids.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.460
I can't believe Fletcher!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.170
We're supposed to be friends.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.630
How could he make fun of me like that?

10:04.670 --> 10:08.340
Well, to be fair, you do
tease him all the time.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.570
To his face, like friends do!

10:14.280 --> 10:15.480
Fine!

10:15.510 --> 10:16.510
If that's how he wants it,

10:16.550 --> 10:18.580
I'm going to fight fire with fire.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.250
Although, interesting
factoid about fighting fires,

10:21.280 --> 10:23.320
you can't really fight fire with
fire, you just get more fire.

10:23.350 --> 10:25.420
Obviously, you fight
fires with fire retardants.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.360
Ow!

10:35.240 --> 10:38.380
I can't believe those
snails ate my eyelashes.

10:38.410 --> 10:41.450
At least, thanks to the Beauty
Club, you'd never know.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.500
Welcome to Fashion Club,
fellow fashionistas.

10:56.530 --> 11:00.600
Wow, Cameron, this is the first time
I've noticed how nice your eyes are.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.240
It's a shame they're trapped in that face.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.440
See? We're having
fun already.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.180
Okay. Today, we're going
to be-sparkle our clothes

11:14.220 --> 11:16.380
to add a little rhinestone flare.

11:16.420 --> 11:20.220
And I have come up with a way to do
it in a fraction of the normal time.

11:23.330 --> 11:27.190
This is a 180 horse power,
hydraulic driven,

11:27.230 --> 11:29.560
fully automatic sparkle blaster.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.180
Let me go next!

11:47.250 --> 11:49.220
Cease fire! Cease fire!

11:55.360 --> 11:56.560
Cameron, are you okay?

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Who said that?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.300
Me. Vanessa.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.200
Which Vanessa?

12:18.110 --> 12:23.080
Fletcher, don't you think you should
stop selling these Pimento T-shirts?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.990
For Olive's sake?

12:25.020 --> 12:26.290
Why do you keep taking her side?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.120
This hasn't been easy on me either.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.130
I had to go to the bank three
times to deposit money today.

12:32.330 --> 12:35.400
And why is she so upset?
I'm portraying her accurately.

12:35.430 --> 12:39.170
Okay, she says the
occasional long winded fact,

12:39.200 --> 12:41.240
but there's more to her than that.

12:41.270 --> 12:42.470
She does lots of other things.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.010
Like what?

12:45.040 --> 12:47.110
Hi, my name is Kvetcher.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.280
I'm in love with a girl named Japan.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.310
Olive, two things.

12:53.350 --> 12:55.380
One, this is beneath you.

12:55.420 --> 12:58.450
And two, where did you
get that awesome costume?

13:00.290 --> 13:05.090
I'm not Olive. I'm Kvetcher.
I'm a fart prodigy.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.260
Whoa!

13:16.100 --> 13:18.110
Someone get a fire retardant.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.470
I'm on it!

13:28.050 --> 13:29.050
I'm okay.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.130
Someone get a fire retardant.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
I'm on it!

14:00.480 --> 14:04.250
I can't believe Fletcher!
Now, I'm an even bigger joke at school.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.090
This is terrible.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.390
The voice for Asia sounds nothing like me.

14:12.390 --> 14:15.230
You're right.
This is not about me.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.160
We have to do something.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.300
I can't stand seeing
my two best friends fight.

14:20.340 --> 14:24.070
What if I'm fighting and
he's just getting punched?

14:26.210 --> 14:28.410
No. You need to
figure out

14:28.440 --> 14:31.350
another way to let him know it bothers you.

14:31.380 --> 14:34.110
A funny suit is not the answer.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.030
You got served!

14:55.040 --> 14:56.300
At is this?

14:56.340 --> 14:59.210
I hired this dance crew
to serve you with a lawsuit.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.010
I'm holding you legally responsible

15:01.040 --> 15:03.180
for mocking me with your stupid cartoon.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.250
This was Chyna's idea.

15:07.050 --> 15:08.080
It was?

15:08.120 --> 15:09.150
No!
Yup!

15:10.190 --> 15:12.190
She said my funny suit was not the answer.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.260
So, obviously she meant I
should use a more serious suit.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.090
A lawsuit.

15:19.130 --> 15:22.960
How can you guys keep
misinterpreting everything I say?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Oh, so now you're saying I smell bad?

15:26.070 --> 15:27.200
Unbelievable!

15:27.240 --> 15:29.370
Oh! So, now you're saying
you hate what I'm wearing?

15:35.770 --> 15:38.740
You're suing me?
I'll sue you right back.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.250
No! Stop serving people!

15:48.020 --> 15:50.020
Enough is enough!

15:50.050 --> 15:53.790
You guys are friends!
I'm not gonna let you guys sue each other!

15:53.830 --> 15:56.890
Fine. Then let's take this
to the school's student court.

15:57.830 --> 15:58.900
We have a student court?

15:58.930 --> 16:00.160
How come no one ever uses it?

16:02.830 --> 16:06.170
I hereby call to order the case of

16:06.240 --> 16:08.970
Doyle versus Quimby!

16:11.080 --> 16:14.910
Oh, that's why no one ever uses it.

16:18.050 --> 16:19.780
Cameron, guess what?

16:19.820 --> 16:22.150
I got us a workout session today
with this personal trainer.

16:22.190 --> 16:25.020
He's a former
Mr. Universe.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.720
We're really lucky because he canceled

16:26.760 --> 16:28.130
his swimsuit modeling gig to do this.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.000
Um... Actually, I was
thinking we could go dancing.

16:55.050 --> 16:56.990
Belly dancing!

16:57.020 --> 17:00.160
Cameron, I think I know why you've
been taking me to all these clubs.

17:00.190 --> 17:03.790
You want to be at a place
where there are only girls.

17:03.830 --> 17:05.859
You're right. It's true.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.230
I knew it.

17:07.270 --> 17:10.000
A hunk like you doesn't want to
be tied down to just one girl.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.099
Exactly.
Wait, what?

17:13.099 --> 17:15.140
Everywhere we go, girls stare at you.

17:15.170 --> 17:18.980
Like when we walked in here, they
couldn't take their eyes off you!

17:19.010 --> 17:21.040
Because I'm wearing this stupid outfit!

17:21.079 --> 17:22.980
Girls couldn't care less about me!

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
He's not wrong.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.850
Don't spare my feelings.

17:28.890 --> 17:32.860
It's obvious you're not as
into me as I am into you.

17:32.890 --> 17:35.030
We should break up, so you
can date other people.

17:35.060 --> 17:38.130
Date other people?
No one's going to date me!

17:38.160 --> 17:41.060
My eyelashes were eaten by snails,

17:41.100 --> 17:42.770
I'm dressed like a genie,

17:42.800 --> 17:46.170
and I have rhinestones where no
man should have rhinestones!

17:47.910 --> 17:49.970
I'm going to miss that sense of humor.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.080
Goodbye, Cameron.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.750
Maybe this breakup is for the best.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.220
It's too much pressure for a guy like
you to go out with a beautiful girl.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.860
You're right.

18:06.890 --> 18:09.890
Maybe I should find someone
more plain and average.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.130
You busy Friday night?

18:17.840 --> 18:18.940
So, Saturday?

18:23.940 --> 18:28.980
All right, student court is now in session.

18:29.010 --> 18:34.150
Olive Doyle, Fletcher Quimby,
please approach the bench.

18:38.190 --> 18:40.860
Hi, little cuties.

18:40.890 --> 18:43.990
Yeah. Yeah. Hi, guys.

18:44.030 --> 18:46.800
Hi, guys.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.830
I will hear both sides of the story,

18:49.870 --> 18:54.000
carefully weigh the merits
and then make my decision.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.140
Fletcher's cartoons made fun of me.

18:55.170 --> 18:56.810
Guilty!

18:56.840 --> 18:57.970
I didn't even say anything!

18:58.010 --> 19:00.880
Good point.
Not guilty!

19:00.910 --> 19:03.180
You can't just shout out
guilty and not guilty.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.050
You have to make a decision.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.950
Okay, there's only one
fair way to decide this.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.090
Rock, paper, scissors!

19:12.120 --> 19:13.860
To the death!

19:16.190 --> 19:18.830
Ha!
Why didn't I grab the rock?

19:18.860 --> 19:20.030
'Cause!

19:20.060 --> 19:21.900
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

19:21.930 --> 19:25.840
Drop the scissors!
Step away from the paper!

19:25.870 --> 19:28.840
Fine. But tell him how Fletcher's
been hurting my feelings!

19:28.870 --> 19:30.770
No. Tell him
she's being oversensitive.

19:30.810 --> 19:34.710
No! I'm not taking sides!

19:34.750 --> 19:37.750
I've been telling you guys
to cut it out for days,

19:37.780 --> 19:39.780
and things have only gotten worse.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.050
I'm done talking.

19:41.090 --> 19:42.850
There's only one thing left to do.

19:44.890 --> 19:45.890
Sing.

19:48.890 --> 19:50.930
Wait. Where did this
spotlight come from?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.200
And that guitar?

19:53.230 --> 19:55.130
Oh, I use my allowance to hire roadies.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.930
I'm glad you found a different

You're right.

22:07.810 --> 22:08.660
Thank you.

22:08.690 --> 22:09.989
She was talking to me.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.990
- I don't think so.
- Stop it.

22:13.940 --> 22:17.160
I'm happy to be made fun of
if it makes you two getting along.

22:17.830 --> 22:19.590

So glad we are friends again.
