00:20.380 --> 00:25.204
His name's Jack.
He's a soldier and he protects me.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.245
I didn't mean to get you mad.
Please. I'll be a good boy.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.070
Please let me out.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.618
Crimes Against Children Unit
COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND

00:51.330 --> 00:52.570
Peter.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.746
Katie. I think Peter's back.

01:10.210 --> 01:13.327
-Peter -I just got a new image.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.785
The screen name of the sender is Hugz.

01:15.790 --> 01:17.166
He just uploaded this to me.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.455
Are we sure it's a new image?

01:18.460 --> 01:20.781
New image. Same boy.
Time and date stamped an hour ago.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.872
Are you communicating directly
with this "Hugz"?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.745
No, I'm in a chat room.
I was just fishing.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.876
Put him up.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.280
Carl, I need to know
where this chat room originated.

01:28.290 --> 01:29.450
People, listen up.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.701
We have a boy we named Peter a year ago.

01:31.710 --> 01:34.668
At the time he was listed
between five and six years old.

01:34.670 --> 01:37.241
Instant message Hugz, "VN-HO".

01:40.920 --> 01:42.911
Very Nice. How Old?

01:47.250 --> 01:48.319
Very.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.661
Go to the site.

02:03.830 --> 02:06.458
-That clock is counting down.
-That's an auction clock.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.282
He's going to sell Peter.
Get me Aaron Hotchner at the BAU.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.781
40,000 images of child porn
are posted every week on the Internet,

02:18.790 --> 02:19.950
B.A.U., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:19.960 --> 02:22.417
along with the appearance
of 20 new children.

02:22.420 --> 02:25.617
The appetite for babies as young
as four months old has soared.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.030
Many of these children have been kidnapped

02:27.040 --> 02:29.281
and sold into pedophile rings.

02:29.290 --> 02:32.111
One year ago the same boy
appeared on several websites

02:32.120 --> 02:33.997
used by pedophiles.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.116
He was a new face then.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.203
After a massive hunt led by
our Crimes Against Children Unit,

02:39.210 --> 02:41.280
the boy disappeared.

02:41.290 --> 02:43.747
Until tonight when SSA Cole telephoned us.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.207
-Katie Cole

02:46.210 --> 02:49.452
One of the first proﬁlers.
Clinical psychologist. Brilliant.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.418
She runs the Crimes Against
Children Unit in Maryland.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.287
-I always wanted to meet her.
-Rea|ly? I heard she's a bitch.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.246
Nobody ever called you that, Katie.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.161
Well, not to my face.

03:01.670 --> 03:05.959
The first time I ever saw him,
he appeared in a series of photos.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.666
I named him Peter.

03:08.460 --> 03:12.282
Now, he's being auctioned off
when that clock runs to zero.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.497
-Auctioned?
-His face isn't pixelated.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.740
Because the UnSub is confident

03:16.750 --> 03:18.615
that we're not going to be able
to identify him in time.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.918
What about the site itself

03:20.920 --> 03:23.616
It's routed through a proxy server
in Belarus.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.372
Even if that government was friendly,

03:25.380 --> 03:27.610
Peter'd be gone by the time
we finished the paperwork.

03:27.620 --> 03:30.669
We don't need to worry about
the paperwork, we have Garcia.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.457
Okay, get on that, will you?
-Yes, sir.

03:34.420 --> 03:35.819
So, what happened a year ago, Katie?

03:35.830 --> 03:38.321
We cross-referenced the images of the boy,

03:38.330 --> 03:40.616
talked to known offenders nationwide.

03:40.620 --> 03:43.532
We narrowed the location down
to the eastern United States.

03:43.540 --> 03:47.203
We had some suspects in,
but the trail went cold. Until today.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.825
With all due respect, Miss Cole,

03:48.830 --> 03:50.536
how is this time
going to be any different?

03:50.540 --> 03:52.371
We have a starting point.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.575
The location where the image
was first discovered.

03:54.580 --> 03:59.199
A chat room hosted by an independent
web company in Cleveland, Ohio.

03:59.790 --> 04:02.873
_ And this time _
I'm bringing you all In With me.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.956
F.B.I. Headquarters
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

04:49.960 --> 04:51.916
Theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said,

04:51.920 --> 04:56.744
"The test of the morality of a society
is what it does for its children."

05:09.380 --> 05:11.416
Well, if it isn't Dr. Reid.

05:11.420 --> 05:12.876
Elle? Wow.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.320
Nice haircut.

05:16.330 --> 05:18.378
Thanks! Yeah.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.871
I like your haircut, too.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.610
-Is that a boys' regular?
-Yeah, it is.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.576
Wait, do you not... Do you not like it?

05:25.580 --> 05:27.286
It's totally you.

05:28.040 --> 05:32.158
So, you're okay?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.456
I didn't think you were back
until next week.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.169
-Oh, I got a text message, so...
-Then it was a mistake.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.612
-Is there a case?
-Not until you're healthy.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.577
Yesterday I found myself looking
forward to watching a soap opera.

05:44.580 --> 05:45.706
Which one?

05:45.710 --> 05:47.780
Please, can you put me back
to work, Hotch?

05:47.790 --> 05:49.166
The doctor hasn't cleared you
for the field...

05:49.170 --> 05:51.035
-Please, Hotch.
-You need more time.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.079
I've been out for four months.
What I need is to go back to work.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.035
We're going to Cleveland.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.326
Reid's going to the Crimes Against
Children Division. Go with him.

06:01.330 --> 06:03.378
-But I can...
-Or go home.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.706
I'm all yours, Dr. Reid.

06:18.750 --> 06:22.413
The image was uploaded
to one of our CAC undercovers

06:22.420 --> 06:24.069
fishing in a chat room.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.071
We try to monitor
as many of them as we can,

06:26.080 --> 06:29.538
pretending to be children, pedophiles,
whatever works on that site.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.610
Have you run forensic linguistics
on the chat log?

06:31.620 --> 06:33.702
There might be something
to Hugz's speech patterns.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.497
It doesn't really work that way
with Internet talk.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.786
Fear of flying.

06:44.710 --> 06:47.611
Linked to deep-rooted issues of control.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.821
I think better on my feet.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.450
Most of the talk is abbreviated text.

06:55.460 --> 06:59.578
LOL, laughing out loud.
IMHO, in my humble opinion. FI'F...

06:59.580 --> 07:01.457
-Face-to-face.
-Rig ht.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.827
Pedophiles can be divided
into two categories.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.115
Situational and preferential.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.702
Situational offenders rarely
seek out children,

07:14.710 --> 07:17.110
but they'll take advantage of
a situation when presented with it.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.533
Where as preferential offenders

07:20.540 --> 07:23.953
actively target children
by age group, hair color.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.910
They'll seek out jobs which give them

07:25.920 --> 07:27.740
as much access to children as possible.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.708
They often trawl around
residential neighborhoods.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.575
Hijacking home wireless systems,

07:32.580 --> 07:34.286
then communicating with children

07:34.290 --> 07:37.373
often outside the very house
the child is in.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.378
Or they'll simply use a coffee shop
with wireless access

07:40.380 --> 07:43.031
to find, locate, and arrange a meeting.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.669
And it's growing.
It's growing as fast as the Internet.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.532
They're getting smarter and smarter

07:49.540 --> 07:50.996
and all the security in the world

07:51.000 --> 07:54.242
can't stop them
from coming through our doors.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.208
Hell, the monsters are already
in our homes.

07:57.790 --> 08:00.202
If he's had this kid for a year,
it makes him preferential.

08:00.210 --> 08:03.282
-Definitely.
-So, then why is he selling him?

08:07.210 --> 08:12.113
Maybe, maybe he's losing interest.
Peter's maybe getting too old, too tall.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.453
Preferential offenders are very specific
about their preferences.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.496
And if he can't sell him?

08:18.830 --> 08:21.116
He isn't going to just let him go.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.371
Hotch?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.535
Yeah.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.202
Yeah, I was thinking, shouldn't we
release Peter's picture to the media?

08:27.210 --> 08:28.325
No! No, no.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.286
If this UnSub thinks that we're onto him,

08:30.290 --> 08:32.451
he may make a run for it
and dispose of the boy.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.109
Shouldn't we assume he does know?

08:34.120 --> 08:37.783
As I said, we intercepted this image
as part of an undercover operation.

08:37.790 --> 08:40.497
These predators have
a fairly closed society.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.413
The way they run these sites gives
them the expectation of anonymity.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.569
Right.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.413
Have Reid and Elle check the live feed.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.321
Not just the boy,
but everything around him, the room.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.661
See if we missed anything.

08:52.670 --> 08:53.989
-Okay.
-Yep.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.075
Amanda Gilroy. You're the BAU?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.241
I'm Spencer Reid,
and this is Agent Greenaway.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.286
You're the agent who had contact
with the image of Peter?

09:00.290 --> 09:04.283
This time. A year ago,
it was Katie who first identified him.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.951
-You call her Katie?
-Everyone does.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.780
She hates to be called Agent Cole.

09:07.790 --> 09:10.327
Make yourselves at home.
We just got your warrants approved.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.072
Katie and your team are about to
pay a visit to the chat room vendor.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.615
Yeah.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.780
Online Listing Service
CLEVELAND, OHIO

09:15.790 --> 09:18.668
Well, we've been having problems with it.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.166
That's fine.

09:21.580 --> 09:22.786
Yeah.

09:23.580 --> 09:26.242
Yeah. One of our main online
listing Sites is down,

09:26.250 --> 09:27.956
but we should be back online in half-hour.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.609
FBI. We have a warrant to search
these premises.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.827
Stop what you're doing right now!

09:31.830 --> 09:33.411
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.287
Can somebody tell me who owns this place?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.280
That'd be me.

09:40.290 --> 09:43.168
I want access to your chat room databases.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.991
It looks like the walls are padded.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.956
And the dimensions are strange.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.167
-Strange?
-It's like a hall but smaller.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.786
-A basement?
-Uh-uh. I don't think so.

09:58.790 --> 10:02.112
Katie just got us access to
the original chat room's database.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.111
It's coming through now.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.871
There must be thousands
of screen names there.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.279
All encrypted.

10:13.290 --> 10:16.168
Yeah, but we're only concerned
about one.

10:17.460 --> 10:18.495
Hugz.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.166
This is so typical.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.201
You Feds just can't help yourselves.

10:24.210 --> 10:27.202
You've got to pollute the truest form
of free expression ever invented.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.531
Agent Morgan, find a chat room
of your choice.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.077
Your name is Suzy. You're 12 years old.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.411
-What are you doing?
-Fishing.

10:33.420 --> 10:36.571
You know, I've got rights
and so do my clients.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.199
That's the sound of pedophiles

10:51.210 --> 10:54.077
looking to hook up with
a 12-year-old girl named Suzy.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.116
You let them run everything
through SSL connections

10:56.120 --> 10:58.372
from prow servers in offshore countries.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.701
So they can't be identified?

11:00.710 --> 11:01.916
Not in 12-and-a-half hours.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.536
Hey, I'm just a middleman here, okay?

11:04.540 --> 11:05.916
What can I do?

11:05.920 --> 11:09.378
There's a little boy for sale
on one of your sites.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.741
"What can I do" just isn't good enough.

11:13.420 --> 11:16.958
Cole was right.
Hugz routed through an offshore proxy.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.325
So, we have no way of tracking him?

11:18.330 --> 11:20.457
Not if you only track him
with this address.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.280
What else do we have?

11:23.000 --> 11:28.415
He used a basic encryption program
to hide his payment method.

11:28.420 --> 11:32.413
And as you know, I'm anything but basic.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.786
You got to love the money trail
a credit card leaves.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.878
Well, well, Graham Rose.
15 Hauser Lane, Richmond, Virginia.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.416
And check this out, JJ.

11:40.420 --> 11:43.821
He used the same card
to pay for a web domain.

11:45.210 --> 11:46.609
Oh, my God.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.029
Oh.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.913
Gideon, we just found another child
being held.

12:18.790 --> 12:19.916
FBI.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.700
You're a bad boy.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.822
You needed to be tied up, didn't you?

12:31.460 --> 12:33.530
Let me see you struggle.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.457
-Clear!
-Push through.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.609
Clear.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.450
Clear here.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.666
May I see your bum?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.115
FBI.

12:53.210 --> 12:54.416
Clear.

12:54.670 --> 12:55.705
Ready? Go.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.109
FBI!

12:59.170 --> 13:00.990
-What are you doing

13:01.000 --> 13:02.490
Where's who?

13:05.380 --> 13:06.824
It's clear.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.491
It's okay. You're safe now.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.535
Safe?

13:13.330 --> 13:15.537
-What's your name?
-Kevin.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.451
The man who did this to you,
is he still here?

13:17.460 --> 13:18.575
This is my house.

13:18.580 --> 13:22.038
Graham Rose is the owner
of this house, where is he?

13:22.540 --> 13:24.667
-No, no, don't touch that.
-Back up.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.989
Where is he?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.457
-He's gone.
-What do you mean, gone?

13:28.460 --> 13:29.825
He's just gone, okay?

13:29.830 --> 13:31.286
Graham Rose is your father?

13:31.290 --> 13:34.248
Yeah, sure. You could call him that.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.286
Ijust call him a bastard.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.201
Are you scared?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.661
Do you think he's mad at us?

14:01.170 --> 14:03.206
His father's been in jail
for the last eight months.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.668
In that time Kevin's been selling the
only thing he's got, which is himself.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.615
Just like a street hustler.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.668
Only now the street is the Internet.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.661
And his client base spans the globe.

14:12.670 --> 14:15.070
Well, this kid definitely uploaded
Peter's video to the chat room

14:15.080 --> 14:16.240
because it's still on his computer.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.376
Yeah, but not the live feed.

14:17.380 --> 14:18.995
Did he say how he got hold of the video?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.207
He said that it came
from one of his clients.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.667
It was a shared file that had
gone around these chat groups.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.035
It's possible.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.110
Buyers and sellers routinely trade files

14:27.120 --> 14:29.327
because the act in itself
is an illegal act,

14:29.330 --> 14:31.571
which proves they're not the police.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.990
Let's go see what else we can ﬁnd out.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.578
Kid, the boy whose video you've been
sending around to all the chat rooms,

14:41.580 --> 14:44.572
he's going to be sold
from one pedophile to another.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.615
Boo hoo.

14:49.790 --> 14:51.030
These are dummy logs.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.373
What's the password to get me into
the real transcripts of your sessions?

14:54.380 --> 14:55.995
You're the FBI. You figure it out.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.912
I know you don't think so, Kevin,
but we are trying to help you here.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.821
Help me? What I do is consensual
and no one's getting hurt.

15:01.830 --> 15:06.164
Come on, Kevin, what's the password Your favorite band?

15:06.170 --> 15:08.616
Kevin, this is prostitution.

15:08.620 --> 15:12.169
Well, I'm a minor.
I don't even really know what I'm doing.

15:12.170 --> 15:17.290
Plus, I never leave this room,
so no one, no one ever touches me.

15:18.330 --> 15:19.615
Anymore.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.457
Your father's been beating you
since you can remember.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.826
At first it was when he was drunk
on the weekend,

15:25.830 --> 15:27.536
then he was always drunk.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.247
You never knew why he was hurting you.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.070
Why he was so angry.

15:34.380 --> 15:35.995
At night, you'd cry yourself to sleep,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.537
hoping someone would come and save you.

15:38.540 --> 15:40.280
No one ever came.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.162
You have a chance to be the one
who saves someone, Kevm.

15:44.170 --> 15:48.072
You can be the one who answers him,
the one who stops his pain.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.490
You can't get to your father,

15:49.500 --> 15:52.822
but you can get to the guy
who's hurting this boy.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.450
Move.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.371
This backs up all my transcripts.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.913
The screen name for the guy
who sent me the file is Mehtevas.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.207
Can you hear me?

16:17.920 --> 16:20.286
Can I get out anytime soon?

16:20.830 --> 16:21.876
Please.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.203
He's got food and water,
a toilet and some toys.

16:28.210 --> 16:30.531
He never has to leave the room.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.747
That's it. It's not a room.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.662
A room has a door.
Even a prison cell has a door.

16:36.670 --> 16:38.114
There are no windows so he can't be seen,

16:38.120 --> 16:39.997
and the walls are padded
so he can't be heard.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.991
The UnSub's anticipating
becoming a suspect.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.115
So, he's hidden the boy.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.203
If there are no doors,
how did he get the boy in the room?

16:46.210 --> 16:50.328
It's like a ship in a bottle.
He's built the room around the boy.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.163
How long has Mehtevas
been a client of yours?

16:56.170 --> 16:57.740
Like, six months.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.162
-Where's he located?
-He's a local.

17:00.170 --> 17:02.536
He's always asking to meet with me,
but I don't do that.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.451
-Does he know where you are?
-Just the city.

17:04.460 --> 17:07.111
How do you contact him?
-He contacts me.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.326
Come on, Kevin,

17:08.330 --> 17:11.288
you don't just sit around here
waiting for these guys to look you up.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.575
That's no way to run a business.

17:12.580 --> 17:16.539
Right now, you're the only person
who can help us find Peter.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.667
What do you want me to do?

17:19.040 --> 17:21.247
Ask him for a face-to-face.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.322
No. No way. I don't do that.
I've never been out of this room.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.878
It'll be fine.
He won't lay a finger on you.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.280
We'll be right there, Kevin,
the whole time.

17:30.290 --> 17:31.871
I promise you.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.532
But won't he be suspicious
if I suddenly want to meet with him?

17:35.540 --> 17:38.077
He's a need-driven offender, Kevin.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.071
What does that mean?

17:40.080 --> 17:43.914
If you offer to meet with him,
he won't be able to resist.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.201
He can't help himself.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.498
You said that he first appeared
a year ago, right?

18:09.500 --> 18:13.948
But he was in a normal room.
The pictures didn't look like that. Here.

18:21.290 --> 18:24.782
So, something changed.
A stressor for him to lock him away.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.200
Hey, guys.

18:27.330 --> 18:28.820
What is it?

18:28.830 --> 18:30.070
I'm not quite sure.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.746
Wait. Do you see
how he's looking off camera?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.741
Someone's telling him to do
what he's doing.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.708
A bidder.
He must want to see him wearing...

18:40.380 --> 18:41.950
Wait a minute.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.491
That's a Tadpole shirt.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.536
It's a Tadpoles shirt!
It's a wilderness group.

18:47.540 --> 18:50.873
Like knot-tying,
compass-wielding boy stuff.

18:51.670 --> 18:52.785
Are you sure?

18:52.790 --> 18:56.112
I have four brothers, JJ.
They all had that shirt.

18:58.380 --> 19:01.076
Is that numbers on his sleeve?

19:01.080 --> 19:05.449
Whoa, whoa, wait, enhance it.
Wait capture that image when he turns.

19:06.170 --> 19:08.206
See, the badge is torn.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.661
It looks like four numbers.
What is that?

19:10.670 --> 19:14.618
Three, something, something.
Is that a six?

19:14.620 --> 19:17.373
That's a unit number.
Four digits ending with a six.

19:17.380 --> 19:20.167
Nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine
possible combinations.

19:20.170 --> 19:22.161
Oh, but a unit number
would be registered, right?

19:22.170 --> 19:24.570
-Already on it, kitten.
-Of course, you are.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.161
That's how I roll.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.910
They're heading to Alexandria.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.993
They want us to look up this address
and tell them what's there.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.700
Plowright.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.166
Alexandria.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.748
That location, it's right outside
of an elementary school.

19:44.290 --> 19:46.281
-Where are you going?
-We could be there in 30 minutes.

19:46.290 --> 19:48.827
-You're not allowed to go anywhere...
-Don't even try it, Reid.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.666
Hi, Mr. Rawlings.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.576
Don't you love that sound?

20:14.210 --> 20:15.575
Excuse me?

20:17.580 --> 20:18.877
Children.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.199
Mehtevas?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.167
You seem nervous.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.456
Well, you are Mehtevas, right?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.576
My friends call me Hayden.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.037
Hey, you're taller in person.

20:34.170 --> 20:37.571
What's the matter Hugz?

20:38.120 --> 20:39.371
Kevin?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.115
FBI! Turn around.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.950
-Agent Morgan!
-I didn't do anything!

20:46.960 --> 20:49.531
Agent Morgan. Take it easy. Take it easy.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.700
We need his cooperation.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.416
We just want to ask him a few questions.

20:52.420 --> 20:54.570
Here's a question?
What's the principal of a school doing

20:54.580 --> 20:57.117
hooking up with a 14-year-old boy?

21:00.040 --> 21:02.110
Let's go. Put him in here.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.166
Okay, I got it.

21:08.170 --> 21:09.319
-Katie.
-Yeah.

21:09.330 --> 21:12.208
Social Services is picking up Kevin
at the Alexandria field office.

21:12.210 --> 21:16.032
I'm going to go with him
and I'll be back as soon as I can.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.826
-You okay?
-Yeah, I...

21:23.920 --> 21:25.114
Yeah.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.327
Hotch, you already got him?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.069
I told you to stay out of the field.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.911
Yeah, I know, but Reid said that
you wanted us here.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.205
-What? No, I didn't!
-Yes, you did.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.917
-I'm sure you didn't, Reid.
-Thanks.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.457
The school district has given us
permission to search Rawlings' office.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.997
I'm on it. Nice one.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.320
Principal of a school.

21:56.330 --> 21:59.413
That's as much access to children
as pOSSlble.

22:00.330 --> 22:02.707
Growing Up Guide for Parents.

22:05.670 --> 22:08.457
He's got a library of child psychology.

22:10.460 --> 22:14.078
-He's got a doctorate in it.
-Well-prepared pedophile.

22:16.620 --> 22:19.783
-Elle, you notice anything missing?
-Computer.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.376
Family man.

22:25.380 --> 22:29.032
So, if he does have Peter,
he's not keeping him at home.

22:32.540 --> 22:34.531
Elle, this one's locked.

22:37.420 --> 22:38.819
Here. Move.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.287
Did they teach you
that in FBI school?

22:44.330 --> 22:46.958
No, they taught me that in Brooklyn.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.322
I wish you would inform me
what exactly I'm being charged with.

22:54.330 --> 22:56.116
Anything I can possibly stick to you.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.326
But I haven't done anything.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.822
You're an educated man, Mr. Rawlings.
You know you're in trouble here.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.707
I believe I just walked outside my school.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.200
Is that a crime now?

23:04.210 --> 23:06.246
Do you know where he is?

23:09.830 --> 23:12.572
How could anyone hurt something so...

23:13.120 --> 23:14.326
Pure?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.877
You sent this image to Kevin.

23:19.710 --> 23:23.874
Well, that was wrong of me, I know,
but I was so shocked.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.371
I wanted to try to save this poor boy.

23:26.380 --> 23:28.530
I thought Hugz...

23:28.540 --> 23:30.417
Kevin might know him.

23:30.790 --> 23:33.327
That's why I sent him the link
to the website. See if he knew.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.821
Please. You were trying to save him?

23:35.830 --> 23:37.878
Help search his office.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.536
I got this.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.707
How were you going to save Peter?

23:55.170 --> 23:58.242
Peter. Is that his name? Peter.

23:59.710 --> 24:02.747
I wanted to save them both. Kevin, too.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.411
Sit down.

24:18.580 --> 24:20.741
Tell me we've got something
we can nail this son of a bitch on.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.571
Not unless we can break the password
on this guy's computer.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.787
-Call Garcia.
-Take too long.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.748
Come on, genius, do something genius-like.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.457
If this guy does have child pornography
on his computer

24:31.460 --> 24:32.950
and we type in the wrong password,

24:32.960 --> 24:35.417
it could trigger a virus
that wipes the entire hard drive.

24:35.420 --> 24:36.614
What's he saying out there?

24:36.620 --> 24:40.875
He's a preferential pedophile
who claims he's trying to save them.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.411
Save them? Save them.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.779
"Mehtevas."

25:09.830 --> 25:11.161
If you could you get any closer...

25:11.170 --> 25:14.037
I can, but it'll distort the image
even more.

25:14.040 --> 25:19.660
There, see, the edge of his badge.
It looks like it says Mount something.

25:19.670 --> 25:26.746
Okay, there are four unit
designations all starting with Mount.

25:26.750 --> 25:30.208
Mount Clements, Minnesota, 2346.

25:30.210 --> 25:32.610
Mount Vernon, New York, 2436.

25:32.620 --> 25:35.453
Mount Pleasant, Virginia, 3446.
That's it. Right?

25:35.460 --> 25:36.825
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, good one.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.702
Mr. Rawlings, have a seat.

25:53.330 --> 25:54.786
Your laptop.

25:58.500 --> 26:01.822
Yeah, it's Morgan.
Okay, hold on, Garcia. Hold on.

26:04.790 --> 26:08.669
This is research. I'm writing a book.

26:08.670 --> 26:09.989
Sit down.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.951
I swear to you this is all just research.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.200
No, it's not research.

26:21.210 --> 26:24.498
That's 100 years
in a federal penitentiary.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.162
I'd like to make a deal.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.319
No deals.

26:34.080 --> 26:37.572
All you have is a very, very small
amount of good will.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.411
Tell me about Peter.

26:41.670 --> 26:44.662
I was contacted by the man
who's holding him.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.661
I didn't search out this boy.

26:46.670 --> 26:49.207
-I didn't go looking for this.
-Give me a name.

26:49.210 --> 26:52.577
Well, I only know the screen name.
It's "Manchild."

26:53.380 --> 26:55.245
Did you bid on Peter?

26:57.040 --> 26:58.416
How much?

27:00.170 --> 27:01.535
$8,000.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.661
But it was only in order to save him.

27:04.670 --> 27:07.571
-Are you the high bidder?
-I think so. Yes.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.535
I was anyway.

27:09.540 --> 27:13.249
I'm supposed to go back online
and contact him on his website

27:13.250 --> 27:14.535
and get the address.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.997
So you can inspect the merchandise?

27:17.000 --> 27:21.323
Look, this child is being auctioned off
and I am trying to save him.

27:21.330 --> 27:23.070
Trying to save him.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.496
He'd have given you a code, what is it?

27:25.500 --> 27:26.819
Come on.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.615
I have a family.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.997
I have children of my own.
I love children.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.036
I would never harm them.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.281
In your pursuit to save them,

27:37.210 --> 27:40.919
do you think you could have avoided
having sex with them?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.530
Mr. Rawlings,

27:44.920 --> 27:46.239
the code.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.576
Butterfly.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.029
Hey?

28:11.460 --> 28:13.997
Hey, when can I come out?

28:14.620 --> 28:17.783
-I'm being a good boy.
-Shut up.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.610
...FBI's Crimes Against Children Unit

28:19.620 --> 28:20.780
and local authorities

28:20.790 --> 28:23.327
have arrested Mark Twain
Elementary School principal

28:23.330 --> 28:24.740
Howard Rawlings today,

28:24.750 --> 28:26.991
in what sources say is a sting operation

28:27.000 --> 28:29.912
targeting what may be one
of the largest pedophile rings

28:29.920 --> 28:31.660
this country has ever seen.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.457
Both agencies have declined to
comment on the arrest at this time

28:34.460 --> 28:36.451
or give any details of the case,

28:36.460 --> 28:38.917
as it is rumored to be connected
to the investigation

28:38.920 --> 28:40.911
of a child pornography ring.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.706
Experts in law enforcement note that

28:42.710 --> 28:45.247
the explosion
of social networking sites...

28:45.250 --> 28:46.990
Hello, Agent Cole.

28:48.790 --> 28:50.781
Parents are advised by advocacy groups...

28:54.290 --> 28:57.202
-What happened?
-I don't know. He broke off contact.

28:58.540 --> 28:59.700
What?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.537
-What happened?
-The entire feed just went dark.

29:05.540 --> 29:06.950
Get Hotch on the phone.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.661
We've got reporters outside of the school.

29:09.670 --> 29:11.285
This thing is all over the news.

29:11.290 --> 29:14.703
Oh, my God. That's why the site
went down. He knows.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.872
She's sure about this, right?

29:33.880 --> 29:36.371
If Garcia says that Tadpole shirt
came from a unit in Mount Pleasant,

29:36.380 --> 29:37.608
then I've got to believe her.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.497
She better be.
Mount Pleasant's 60 miles away

29:39.500 --> 29:41.786
and there's only two hours left
on the auction clock.

29:41.790 --> 29:43.326
Maybe.

29:43.330 --> 29:47.448
If the UnSub knows that we're onto him
he may move that clock up.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.457
Do you think this guy's going to panic?

29:52.460 --> 29:54.667
I don't know.
Depends on his comfort level.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.912
It may be getting close to auction time,
he can wait it out.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.616
I know one thing,
I can't lose Peter again.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.781
Well, let's just hope
JJ bought us some time.

30:02.790 --> 30:04.496
Harry, I need a favor.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.493
It's absolutely all right
that you broadcast this.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.992
We have to bluff this kid's captor into
believing that we're in another locale.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.242
It'll buy us time.
The kid's life depends on it, okay?

30:15.250 --> 30:17.878
This is the lie.
Say the Crimes Against Children Unit

30:17.880 --> 30:21.327
is searching for a boy
being held captive in Virginia.

30:21.330 --> 30:24.208
He's approximately four feet tall.

30:24.210 --> 30:26.030
He has brown hair.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.077
Look, we need you to get this
on the air immediately.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.377
Thank you.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.916
The FBI has informed us

30:31.920 --> 30:34.616
they are looking
for a missing 7-year-old child.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.451
Now, this child is believed
to be somewhere

30:36.460 --> 30:38.781
within the Alexandria area right now.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.872
A door-to—door search is being coordinated

30:40.880 --> 30:43.371
by members of
the Crimes Against Children Unit.

30:43.380 --> 30:47.703
The boy is described as approximately
three-feet tall with sandy-brown hair.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.200
Last seen...

30:51.210 --> 30:52.996
JJ, it's back.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.286
We got it back up, Hotch.

30:55.290 --> 30:58.077
We got an hour until the auction closes.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.951
The site went dark for a few minutes
and then came back online.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.497
So, he believes the story
JJ fed to the media.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.207
-But we've only got an hour left.
-Right.

31:11.210 --> 31:13.166
The Tadpoles are affiliated with a church.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.319
When we get to Mount Pleasant,

31:14.330 --> 31:17.208
Elle and Morgan should go
to the church, we'll take the school.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.872
That sounds good.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.575
I gave up on him.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.496
A year ago, I gave up on looking for him.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.910
There were so many other kids.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.707
Katie, I'm sure you did what you could.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.821
Do you ever ask yourself
how you make a decision like that?

31:32.830 --> 31:33.990
How do you come to the conclusion

31:34.000 --> 31:35.956
that it's time to move on to the next kid?

31:35.960 --> 31:39.669
How... How do you give yourself
that kind of permission?

31:40.250 --> 31:44.459
What's happened to that boy
in the year I stopped looking for him?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.666
Do you recognize him?

31:58.670 --> 32:00.285
I can't say that I do.

32:00.290 --> 32:01.746
MOUNT PLEASANT, VIRGINIA

32:01.750 --> 32:04.207
But you're certain that this shirt came
from this unit of the Tadpoles, right?

32:04.210 --> 32:06.701
It disbanded six months ago.

32:06.710 --> 32:09.782
Why?

32:09.790 --> 32:14.238
I was told there wasn't enough interest.
Only a few boys participated.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.037
Do you have the records
of those who did participate?

32:20.040 --> 32:22.702
How could anyone do this to a child?

32:24.330 --> 32:26.457
We need to find this boy.

32:26.830 --> 32:28.206
The records?

32:28.210 --> 32:31.111
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

32:32.670 --> 32:33.955
Wait.

32:34.540 --> 32:37.247
There may be a photo of the Tadpoles.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.703
Fairvale Elementary School
MOUNT PLEASANT, VIRGINIA

32:43.580 --> 32:45.377
This boy
is in a terrible state.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.826
But do you recognize him?
Please look carefully.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.457
You said his appearance
may have been altered?

32:49.460 --> 32:51.746
First or second grade student.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.820
Let me check my records.

32:57.620 --> 33:00.282
This may be
what you're looking for.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.206
Yeah, that's him right there.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.700
Is there a name, address, anything?

33:08.710 --> 33:10.666
As I said, there are no records left.

33:10.670 --> 33:13.241
The church was run pretty sloppily
until I took over.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.956
Let me see that.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.286
His name's Charlie.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.747
This is everyone who registered
for the second grade.

33:25.750 --> 33:26.910
That's a lot of names.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.239
What about the kids who didn't register?

33:28.250 --> 33:29.410
Excuse me?

33:29.420 --> 33:32.207
Were there any first graders
who didn't register for second grade?

33:32.210 --> 33:34.826
I imagine there were some transfers.

33:40.710 --> 33:43.372
Yes. Yes, there were two transfers.

33:44.250 --> 33:48.459
-Ashleigh Waters and Charlie Sparks.
-Charlie Sparks.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.280
Does it say where Charlie's records went?

33:50.290 --> 33:51.871
His father picked them up himself.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.108
Can you describe the father?

33:53.120 --> 33:55.577
-Oh, dear, no. I'd have no idea.
-Thank you.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.208
The end of the school year here
is so very hectic.

33:58.210 --> 34:00.201
We have children from...

34:12.330 --> 34:14.286
The name the school has is Charlie Sparks.

34:14.290 --> 34:16.246
No Sparks in any of the phone directories.

34:16.250 --> 34:19.708
Garcia can't even find a Sparks within
100 miles for the last 10 years.

34:19.710 --> 34:21.109
Probably not his real name anyway.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.281
The school said he may have moved away.

34:23.290 --> 34:26.612
Then we start over again.
We don't have a lot of time left.

34:26.620 --> 34:29.168
You guys, maybe we're looking at this
the wrong way.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.661
-What do you mean

34:31.670 --> 34:34.377
The UnSub apparently listed
this kid in school

34:34.380 --> 34:35.995
and the Tadpoles until about a year ago.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.492
At that point, he had pictures of him
online in a regular-looking room,

34:39.500 --> 34:43.072
but, now, he's in a prison-like room
with no windows, no doors.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.240
Completely hidden.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.206
Preferential pedophiles
don't change overnight.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.168
So, what happened a year ago to make
him change his behavior so much?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.285
Fear.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.871
Katie, you almost caught him.

34:53.880 --> 34:57.532
You probably talked to him.
The UnSub's in your records.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.786
Guys, we just ran out of time.

35:41.670 --> 35:42.876
Jack!

35:43.670 --> 35:44.819
Jack!

35:46.000 --> 35:47.115
Jack!

35:58.420 --> 35:59.569
Jack?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.246
I never really had a good suspect.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.413
I only did some general interviews
with child offenders on the east coast.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.956
One of them was the right guy.

36:09.960 --> 36:15.375
Amanda, hey, I need you to pull
all the original files on Peter's case.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.917
Somewhere in my office. Try my desk.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.536
I need the names of everyone
I interviewed.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.280
Have her call Penelope Garcia at the BAU.

36:22.290 --> 36:24.372
_She'll be able to tell us
if we can cross any off.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.166
You got it? Thanks.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.917
-You still there?
-Yeah.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.069
Okay.

36:37.670 --> 36:38.785
Oh.

36:44.790 --> 36:47.452
Oh, oh, oh. Got it, got it, got it.

36:47.460 --> 36:52.113
Okay, Frank Portwell, DOB, 11 April, 1962.

36:53.460 --> 36:55.371
Doing 12 years in Westover Prison.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.747
Okay, Martin DeVries,
DOB, 20 November, '70.

36:58.750 --> 37:02.072
I've got a death certificate for him.
Shot on the street last January.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.411
All right.

37:04.170 --> 37:07.662
Michael Earlson, DOB, 16 January, '64.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.417
Garcia, you're sure?

37:27.250 --> 37:32.699
Okay, no, no, I got it all. I got it all.
All right, thanks, baby. You're the best.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.746
All right, guys, listen up.
We might have something.

37:34.750 --> 37:38.538
Twelve men were interviewed,
eight are back in prison, one is dead,

37:38.540 --> 37:39.950
one lives in California,

37:39.960 --> 37:43.111
and two have last known addresses
within 10 minutes of us.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.827
A Patrick Forest and a Michael Earlson.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.287
Patrick Forest isn't smart enough
to have put this all together.

37:48.290 --> 37:50.918
-What about Michael Earlson?
-Definitely.

38:45.460 --> 38:49.373
Where you going?
Do something now, punk. Don't move.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.785
Oh, God.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.990
Oh, God.

39:20.330 --> 39:21.536
Daddy?

39:22.120 --> 39:25.283
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Daddy!

39:26.880 --> 39:29.246
You're safe now. I've got you.
I've got you.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.740
Where's Daddy?

39:31.500 --> 39:32.785
I know.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.956
You think about it.

39:52.330 --> 39:55.117
Peter's real name is Dustin Powers.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.783
He abducted him in Newark,
New Jersey, when he was one.

40:01.580 --> 40:04.822
Sometimes it seems
there's no punishment enough.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.070
JJ traced his mother.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.031
-She's on her way.
-Okay.

40:14.290 --> 40:16.246
You know, Katie,
no one's ever done the job you're doing

40:16.250 --> 40:18.662
as long as you've been doing it.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.245
I know.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.701
Maybe it's time to get out.

40:29.210 --> 40:31.496
I don't know if I can anymore.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.036
I just can't thank you all enough.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.110
Remember what I told you.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.497
He doesn't know who you are,
and you can say hello,

40:48.500 --> 40:51.207
but don't say anything
about being his mother.

40:51.210 --> 40:52.825
That'll just scare and confuse him.

40:52.830 --> 40:53.990
All right.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.457
It's going to be a long process.
-I understand.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.030
He's this way.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.495
What's his name?

41:40.830 --> 41:42.786
His name's Jack.

41:42.790 --> 41:45.452
He's a soldier. He protects me.

41:49.670 --> 41:51.877
It's nice to meet you, Jack.

41:52.620 --> 41:54.372
My name is Jackie.

41:55.620 --> 41:56.917
Really?

41:57.380 --> 41:58.608
Really.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.701
Can I see Jack?

42:05.710 --> 42:07.109
Be careful.
