WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:07.398
Heads up, Emery.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.486
Throw it high
so I have to jump.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.967
Oh, pits are lookinga little yellow, buddy.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.229
May be time to bleach 'em.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.275
This is why I can't wear
Eddie's hand-me-downs.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.059
Between the stains and the holesand the smells?

00:16.103 --> 00:18.540
I need to update
my wardrobe.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.107
As someone who's wearingEddie's old pants right now...

00:20.150 --> 00:22.935
no way Mom's going
to pay for that.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.154
Hey, I'm happy
to put another son

00:24.198 --> 00:25.286
on the payroll
at Cattleman's.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.201
I think the food industry's
more Eddie's thing.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.332
Oh.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.551
Your brother's
all done.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.248
Time for you to get
all warm and toasty.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.120
Yeah, you need to findyour own thing.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.731
Eddie:Oh, you're on the job hunt?

00:35.774 --> 00:37.428
I rememberbeing in the hustle.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.734
But now I'm chilling.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.344
I got a job, a lady,

00:40.388 --> 00:42.999
and killer spring break planson South Padre Island.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.262
Still can't believe you got
Mom and Dad to let you do that.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.655
Honestly,
I can't, either.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.744
But we shook on it,so the ship has sailed.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.920
Lawd, the chores I did
to convince you guys.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.575
I vacuumed, I mopped,
I even made a bed.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.925
It wasn't that hard,
but I'll never do it again.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.448
Oh, God.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.015
Don't take a picture of mein Eddie's jeans.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.234
No.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.148
It's for Eddie.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.801
SAT results
arrive this week.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.760
Already?
Yes.

01:04.803 --> 01:05.978
And I'm going
to camera capture your face

01:06.022 --> 01:07.328
when you see your score.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.981
It'll either be
a look of joy

01:09.025 --> 01:10.287
or a portrait of failure

01:10.331 --> 01:12.246
they'll put on the back
of a milk carton

01:12.289 --> 01:13.464
when I make you go missing.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.771
They only do thatfor the blonde kids.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.142
Guys, I'm gonna need you

01:39.186 --> 01:40.926
to take it from
an eight to a two.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.493
The answer is six.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.061
Good job, Eddie.
Thanks.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.280
The Florida State Spelling Bee
is around the corner.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.977
This is my last chance
to complete

01:48.020 --> 01:49.587
the Academic Iron Man.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.328
When you add the word "academic"
to a sporting event,

01:51.372 --> 01:53.287
it hurts me deep down
in my soul.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.984
I won the math
and science fairs,

01:55.027 --> 01:56.377
but spelling
is the final leg.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.074
I need your help.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.729
It's the only subject
I've gotten a regular A in.

02:00.772 --> 02:01.860
Myhelp?

02:01.904 --> 02:03.384
The only spelling I know
is Tori Spelling.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.299
She can't whistle
and loves avocados.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.387
Do you remember
Simryn Patel?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.823
You went to middle school
with her?

02:07.866 --> 02:09.390
She won the bee
three years in a row.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.087
That's
a spelling-bee turkey.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.654
Yeah.
I remember her.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.743
Always dancing,
kept a clean locker.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.397
We were lab partners,
and one of us burned down

02:16.440 --> 02:18.442
the eye-wash station.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.053
Well, for us spell-nuts,
she's the Q-U-E-E-N.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.881
Queen.
Two for two.

02:22.925 --> 02:23.882
I need you
to introduce me to her

02:23.926 --> 02:25.406
so I can get some tips.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.450
No can do.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.973
I got big problems
of my own right now.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.627
My SAT scores are coming
in the mail this week,

02:29.671 --> 02:31.455
and I'm worried
about Mom.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.414
Remember what happened
when I got my PSAT scores?

02:33.457 --> 02:37.809
One minute in the cornerfor every point under 1600.

02:37.853 --> 02:38.810
Mom, come on.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.029
It's the 250th episodeof "The Simpsons."

02:40.072 --> 02:42.901
What ifit's their last year?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.338
This is way worse.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.340
I blacked out from nerves
for the first half of the test,

02:46.383 --> 02:47.906
and I'm pretty sure
I bombed.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.300
Mom's gonna cancel
South Padre.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.346
I learned to say "y'all"
for nothing.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.347
Well,
if you put in the work

02:53.390 --> 02:54.696
like I am
for the spelling bee,

02:54.739 --> 02:55.827
you wouldn't be
so worried now.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.789
He really gotthe worst of Mom
andDad.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.486
I'm a dead man.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.618
This is worse than when Grandma
ruined Mom's credit score

03:03.661 --> 03:05.402
by buying
all those Madonna bras.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.361
Mom got so mad,
her nose bled.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.014
From both sides.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.277
How did Grandma
come back from that?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.408
She got
on Mom's good side

03:11.452 --> 03:13.236
by helping Evan
get an A in P.E.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.585
That's it.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.674
I bomb the SATs,but I bail out the golden child.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.242
Mom forgives me,
and I save South Padre.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.635
That's
a pretty good plan.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.071
You go through the pain
to sun your buns,

03:22.114 --> 03:23.246
you don't waste it.♪ Yeah

03:29.165 --> 03:31.036
Aah!
You find a job?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.474
Not yet.
I was helping Eddie.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.519
Damn it,
I said the wrong brother.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.390
Ice cream
is for closers.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.305
You want some,
go get a job.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.657
I feel like
that's the wrong strategy

03:42.700 --> 03:43.962
to motivate Emery.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.486
Just my two cents.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.661
Cheap advice
is bad advice.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.532
He's gotten lazyand needs consequences.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.533
Simple.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.361
No, I'm just saying,
if we push too hard,

03:51.405 --> 03:53.058
he'll rush
and make a bad choice.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.452
It's Emery.
He needs a...gentle touch.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.497
Gentle?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.499
He's a teenager,not a butterfly wing.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.414
Well, he's been weighing
some jobs at the mall

04:00.457 --> 04:02.067
and needs a little time
to decide on the right one.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.678
It's a job at the mall.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.375
What is there to decide?

04:05.419 --> 04:07.290
No matterwhat job he chooses,

04:07.334 --> 04:09.292
he's using the bathroomat Nordstrom.
Trust me.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.989
I know Emery.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.078
Give him some space, and he'll
pick one before we know it.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.079
Last time I trusted you,

04:14.123 --> 04:15.733
we ended upat a tapas restaurant.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.344
"Shared plates"?

04:17.387 --> 04:19.563
No thank you.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.522
Speaking of plates,
when is dinner?

04:23.828 --> 04:26.091
There's my little
academic athlete.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.092
You're kicking
that dictionary's ass

04:27.136 --> 04:29.443
like an Asian Chuck Norris.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.574
Why didn't you just gowith Bruce Lee?

04:30.618 --> 04:32.359
He's already Asian.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.884
Look,
I felt bad about earlier,

04:35.927 --> 04:37.799
and of course
I'll intro you to Simryn.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.017
Really?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.497
Face time with the legend?

04:40.541 --> 04:42.369
Simryn's my girl.
The Simster. Sim Dog.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.240
Simmy Simmy Ko Ko Bop.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.242
Wait a sec.What's in it for you?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.200
Other than the satisfaction
of helping out my brother?

04:49.463 --> 04:50.333
Okay, fine.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.943
SAT scores
are gonna come in,

04:51.987 --> 04:53.467
and Mom's gonna kick me
to the streets.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.990
And eventually,
I'm gonna need

04:55.033 --> 04:56.470
a guest house
to crash at,

04:56.513 --> 04:57.775
and you're the best bet
to have one.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.777
Hmm.That surprisingly tracks.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.257
Okay. Thanks, Eddie.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.607
In South Padre,a guest house would be a
casita.

05:03.651 --> 05:04.608
I'll grab
my driving sandals...

05:04.652 --> 05:06.567
And your foot spray.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.959
...and you go tell Mom
that your loving older brother

05:08.003 --> 05:09.178
is helping you achieve
academic greatness,

05:09.221 --> 05:10.832
and we're on our way.

05:10.875 --> 05:11.963
Effulgent!

05:12.007 --> 05:13.400
That means brilliant.It's from the Latin --

05:13.443 --> 05:14.792
Not now.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.272
I'll save it
for the car.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.497
Ice cream?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.236
Uhp, hands off.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.803
I gotEmery looking for jobs

05:25.847 --> 05:27.414
without threatening
consequences,

05:27.457 --> 05:29.372
so I earnedthis double choco mint.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.157
It's just mint.
Eddie already got in there.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.594
He got all the choco?How?

05:33.637 --> 05:34.595
He used
your mother's tweezers.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.510
Oh.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.425
Hey, there, Pretty Woman,back from the mall?

05:39.687 --> 05:41.645
Someone must have gottenhis first paycheck.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.168
No. I emptied out
my Christmas gift cards.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.649
What about finding
a new job?

05:45.693 --> 05:47.172
You wanted me to
find my own thing,
and I didn't.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.173
The search continues.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.219
Jessica:
Oh, look, Louis.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.612
He's unemployed and happy.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.830
Emery, you ding-dong.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.658
Time for consequences.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.312
Hey! My new clothes!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.009
You want
your party dresses back?

05:58.053 --> 05:59.576
Get a job. By tomorrow.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.451
He's like a horse,

06:04.494 --> 06:07.105
and I'm the tiny person
riding him to success.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.414
Trent, my SAT scores
show up yet?Trent: Negative.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.589
That means no.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.243
But I got eyes on the box.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.505
That means mailbox. Good.

06:15.549 --> 06:16.419
I need you to buy time

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
until I help Evan
win the spelling bee.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.510
You sure my mom
can't see you?

06:20.554 --> 06:22.120
Oh, don't worry.
It's impossible.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.775
Oh, I gotta go.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.429
I'm using Trish's cell,and her boyfriend's calling.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.997
Hello, Muscles.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.565
No, I've been thinkingabout youall day.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.218
Oh, stop it.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.787
Simryn lives here?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.223
♪ Baby, baby, won't you

06:38.267 --> 06:40.487
♪ Come to me

06:40.530 --> 06:42.706
♪ Show me who you are, baby

06:42.750 --> 06:43.925
♪ I'm craving for you

06:43.968 --> 06:45.579

06:54.501 --> 06:56.677
Eddie Huang
from piccolo class?

06:56.720 --> 06:58.505
Simryn! 'Sup, girl?
It's been forever.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.463
You're like two feet taller.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.595
I've been eating.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.597
It's so cool you live
in this motel.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.859
Do they come in
and make your beds?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.600
No, my family owns it.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.123
We make the beds.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.646
Oh, well,
at least you have free HBO.

07:09.690 --> 07:13.694
Again, we're not guests
at our own motel.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.173
Oh, I get it.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.914
Like my dad
and his restaurant.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.264
Everyone assumes I'm eating
steaks for free every day.You do.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.744
Yeah, but...

07:20.788 --> 07:22.616
You're right.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.357
He always is.
This is my brother, Evan.

07:25.401 --> 07:26.707
I was hoping you could help him
win the spelling bee.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.317
1998. Diphtheria?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.840
Hidden H after the P.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.190
Mama rolled
right through it.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.323
When diphtheria takes
down two of your uncles
at a family reunion,

07:34.366 --> 07:36.630
you learn to spell it.See, Evan?

07:36.673 --> 07:38.370
You're learning already.
Simryn, can't thank you enough.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.197
Take as much time
as you need.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.634
A couple days, even.

07:40.677 --> 07:41.896
I'll be here chilling
by the pool,

07:41.939 --> 07:42.679
sunning my buns.♪ Yeah

07:42.723 --> 07:44.507
Sorry. I can't.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.074
I've got work
around the motel,

07:46.117 --> 07:48.511
and I'm going
to the Mandy Moore concert

07:48.555 --> 07:50.208
and I need to perfect
my "Candy" dance.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.566
Getting there.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.699
Heh.
Anyway,
good luck at the bee, Evan.

08:02.743 --> 08:03.874
When in doubt,

08:03.918 --> 08:06.181
imagine the words
in their underwear.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.314
Well, that was cool.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.402
She's not your friend,

08:10.446 --> 08:11.534
we reminded her
of her sick uncles,

08:11.578 --> 08:12.709
and now we're going home.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.629
Eddie, let's go.

08:19.673 --> 08:20.587
You've already wasted enough
of my spelling time.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.676
Wait, I think I can stillget Simryn to help us.

08:23.807 --> 08:24.895
Come on, Eddie.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.418
I need to get home
and hit the dicks!

08:26.462 --> 08:27.898
Nope.
Tried to shorten "dictionary."

08:27.942 --> 08:29.770
Did not work out.

08:32.773 --> 08:33.817
Here we go, Mina.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.124
Hi.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.429
No.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.605
We don't need
any more magazines.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.041
I'm not getting scammedagain.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.045
I will take two "Rod and Reel"subscriptions, please.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.612
But that's it.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.483
Mom, Dad, room 16 asked
for more soap --

08:47.527 --> 08:49.659
Oh, Eddie,
you're still here?Eddie: Simryn, please,

08:49.703 --> 08:51.618
you gotta help Evanstudy for the spelling bee.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.794
Sorry,
I'm just really busy.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.360
DC: Ah. Busy?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.579
Strong words
coming from the girl

08:56.623 --> 08:58.146
who takes
15-minute showers.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.364
Mina:
Strong words from the man

08:59.408 --> 09:01.845
who takes 45 minutes
to iron his jeans.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.194
Sorry about them.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.677
Simryn, how do you know
these magazine salesmen?

09:07.721 --> 09:08.678
Eddie and I
were classmates.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.810
We never dated.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
But your daughter
is very beautiful.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.988
A beautifulspelling bee legend.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.206
Yeah, that's actually
why we're here.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.686
We need Simryn
to help Evan win.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.383
Of course Simryn can help.

09:18.427 --> 09:21.169
I call her "Hamburger"because she's such a helper.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.041
It's 'cause of
Hamburger Helper.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.739
You know, the...

09:25.782 --> 09:27.305
Yeah, Dad, they know.
So embarrassing.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.437
When I am ever
embarrassing?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.612
Just now?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.745
Yesterday at the market,
when you juggled the lettuce?

09:31.788 --> 09:33.703
Every time the Cleveland Indianscome to town?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.270
Alright, smiles up,
Patels.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.533
We're about to get
on the Jumbotron.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.883
Now the real Indiansare here!

09:41.319 --> 09:45.280
There is nothing embarrassingabout clever wordplay.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.760
Come on, Hamburger.
Help us.

09:46.803 --> 09:47.978
DC: You'll be great.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.763
You spent weeks studying
for those spelling bees.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.504
Yeah. I-I did.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.028
But the thing is,

09:54.071 --> 09:57.553
I have all these
motel chores, so...

09:57.597 --> 09:59.511
I'll do your chores.
Love chores.DC: Great.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.991
He loves chores.

10:01.035 --> 10:01.992
You can start tomorrow.

10:02.036 --> 10:02.863
Everybody's happy.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.647
So happy.
Cool.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.827
Want to trade
shoulder massages?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.133
I do you, you do me?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.438
No, I like
my shoulders tight.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.919
Okay.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.660
Guess who got a job

10:17.704 --> 10:19.923
as the newest associate
at Abernathy & Fitz?

10:19.967 --> 10:21.359
Wow.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.709
Isn't that amazing,
Louis?

10:22.752 --> 10:24.275
Yeah.You know what's amazing?

10:24.319 --> 10:25.799
The Brazilian rainforest.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.757
We don't even know
what's in there.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.716
Emery, you can have
your party dresses back.

10:29.759 --> 10:30.717
Thanks for the push, Mom.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.937
Abernathy & Fitz.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.157
Not only did I get Emery
to pick a job,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.115
but he picked one
at a law firm.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.901
Looks like I earned myself
some ice cream.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.776
You still in for tradesies
on massages?

10:46.820 --> 10:49.953
These new bra straps
are killing my shoulders.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.956
No, Ma.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.828
Trent:  Hello, this is Trish.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.046
No scores yet?Nope.

10:56.090 --> 10:59.049
But Brian got his,and ooh, buddy, it was bad.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.834
Like,single-digit-hundies.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.705
Oh, God.
It's gonna be bad.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.186
I gotta make sure Evan gets all
the training here he can get.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.408
Brobdingnagian.Please use it
in a sentence.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.541
The blue whale is a mammal
of brobdingnagian proportions.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.586
Eddie: Damn.

11:14.630 --> 11:17.938
This is the biggest washing
machine I've ever used.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.940
The biggest washing machineI ever used growing up?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.768
The Ganges.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.857
We need a new movie quote.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.947
Eddie:"Luke...I Am Your Motel."

11:26.990 --> 11:28.122
It's from "Star Wars."

11:29.645 --> 11:30.777
Celerity.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.865
Please use it
in a sentence.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.564
Okay.
Got to work fast.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.740
Only 10 minutes beforethe next guest checks in.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.002
DC:
"You know what they call

11:39.046 --> 11:40.569
a Quarter Pounder With Cheese
in Paris?

11:40.612 --> 11:41.962
A Motel With Cheese."

11:42.005 --> 11:43.572
I don't get it.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.748
It's from "Pulp Fiction."Mm.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.881
You still don't get it,do you?
No.

11:47.924 --> 11:51.145
Celerity of movement is vital
in the 100-meter dash.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.973
♪ Who's down with OPP?

11:53.016 --> 11:55.018
♪ This whole party ♪ Break it down

11:55.062 --> 11:55.976
Eddie: I got it.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.630
Wait. Mr. Patel?
I'm stuck!

11:58.674 --> 12:01.024
"Austin Powers."

12:01.068 --> 12:03.984
Yeah, baby.

12:04.027 --> 12:07.030
Pterodactyl.Evan: P-T-E-R-O--

12:07.074 --> 12:08.249
That was Trent.

12:08.292 --> 12:12.209
My SAT scores came in,
and it's, uh...wow.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.821
Ooh, that's not good.

12:14.864 --> 12:18.215
Hey, man, it's been proven
standardized testing is racist.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.826
Not racist enough.
I got a 1500.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.001
Whoa! Congrats!

12:21.044 --> 12:22.176
Evan: What?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.395
But you said
you blacked out.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.832
I guess your boy's
just a natural.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.616
Let's steal some of these tasty
pillow mints and head home.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.704
But I'm not done yet.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.924
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm safe.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.142
Plus, you studied a bunch.
Let's go.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.144
You're safe?

12:34.188 --> 12:35.972
So, this was
all about you.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.844
You never cared
about helping me.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.062
I should have known better.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.717
I did mean what I said
about the guest house.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.023
Sorry to jump in,

12:43.066 --> 12:44.938
but we don't have
pillow mints.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.374
What have you been eating?

12:50.987 --> 12:52.946
I want you to know,

12:52.989 --> 12:54.861
when Eddie bombs the SAT
and mysteriously vanishes,

12:54.904 --> 12:56.601
you can have his room.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.168
Mm.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.691
Your law firm
is next to the mall?

12:59.735 --> 13:00.692
Law firm?

13:00.736 --> 13:02.651
Abernathy & Fitzis a clothing store.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.044
For lawyers?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.220
No.
Oh.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.917
Well, not as prestigious,
but still a job.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.484
Yeah.Turns out "my thing" was

13:09.527 --> 13:11.529
whatever got me to mynew wardrobe the quickest.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.140
Let me just get
my uniform on.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.970
There.
Ready for work.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.710
What is happening?

13:18.754 --> 13:20.321
It's store policy to haveshirtless male greeters.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.062
I guessit brings in customers.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.759
I get my torso oil today.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.760
Wish me luck.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.898
Oh, God.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.422
I've turned my teenage son
into a stripper.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.903
A maleone.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.210
I can't believe you,
Eddie.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.082
This is worse than when
Emery stretched out

13:42.125 --> 13:43.866
my favorite
checkered polo.Eddie: Dude, I'm sorry.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.086
Spring break was on the lineand I got carried away,

13:46.129 --> 13:47.914
but if you have more to do,we can stay.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.350
Um,I think he's got it.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.092
Really?
I'm ready for the bee?

13:52.135 --> 13:53.702
You think I can win?

13:53.745 --> 13:57.445
Uh, well,there's no guarantees.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.099
But I mastered your
spelling system, right?

13:59.142 --> 14:02.102
Uh...w-well...

14:02.145 --> 14:04.539
t-to be honest,I don't really have a system.

14:04.582 --> 14:05.540
I never really studied.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.150
What?

14:07.194 --> 14:09.457
I said I'd help you to stayon my parents' good side.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.676
I mean, the Mandy concert'son the line.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.113
Mandy friggin' Moore.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.462
She cute.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.506
If you didn't study,

14:15.550 --> 14:17.030
then how did you win
three times?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.074
I don't know.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.381
I hear a word,
close my eyes,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.600
see some colors,
and spell it?

14:22.644 --> 14:24.124
Seriously?

14:24.167 --> 14:26.256
So, you black out
and get a 1500,

14:26.300 --> 14:28.084
and you're a Mandy-head
with synesthesia?

14:28.128 --> 14:29.085
Synesthesia.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.348
Purple S, green Y...

14:32.306 --> 14:34.569
Sorry, can't turn it off.This isn't fair.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.918
You're both naturals,

14:35.962 --> 14:38.051
and I'm a sucker
who has to put in the work.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.748
Dude,
you're a straight-A student.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.010
Who cares?

14:41.054 --> 14:42.490
I care because
I have to earn it.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.318
You guys just wake up
and it's there.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.059
No effort. Voilà.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.625
Come on, Evan.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.062
I mean, why even bother
with the spelling bee?

14:49.105 --> 14:50.977
Some natural's just gonna
swoop in and beat me anyway.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.282
It's pointless.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.023
I quit.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.070
Not to belittle his outrage,

14:57.113 --> 14:58.985
but he is so cute
when he storms off.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.342
Man,I really messed him up.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.649
He didn't even sanitizethe chair before he landed.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.216
Oh, no.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.349
Is your brother crying?

15:15.392 --> 15:16.350
In public?

15:16.393 --> 15:18.221
Don't let him do that
in the pool.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.744
It messes up the PH
of the water.

15:19.788 --> 15:24.184
He's frustrated I got a 1500on my SATs without studying.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.099
I take it fitted sheets
weren't on the test.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.840
I think he's jealous'cause I'm a natural.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.104
Man, I don't understand
this obsession

15:31.147 --> 15:33.106
with "being a natural."

15:33.149 --> 15:34.977
I mean,it's kind of awesome.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.674
I crushed the SATs.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.807
Don't even rememberfilling in the ovals.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.982
Hmm. Congrats.

15:40.026 --> 15:40.983
You're a natural
at something useless

15:41.027 --> 15:42.811
that makes no money.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.247
Did you switch bodieswith my mom?

15:44.291 --> 15:46.162
Look around.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.382
If we hadn't
put in the work,

15:48.425 --> 15:50.036
the Magic Motor Inn
would never have made it

15:50.079 --> 15:52.212
to AAA's list of most
affordable motor lodges

15:52.255 --> 15:53.996
off the I-4
in East Orlando.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.999
Did you switch bodieswith my dad?

15:57.043 --> 15:59.262
The point is...

15:59.306 --> 16:01.786
natural talent
only takes you so far.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.919
Key to success --
hard work.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.052
Look at Simryn.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.141
She wouldn't have won
all those spelling bees

16:08.184 --> 16:09.925
if she didn't
put in the work.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.319
She said she didn't studyfor any of those.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.455
You never studied
for the spelling bee?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.719
You lied to us
about being at the library.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.417
No, I was at the library,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.723
reading magazines
on microfiche.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.421
Did you know
there's a "Vogue"

16:27.464 --> 16:29.162
for Amish girls?What?

16:29.205 --> 16:30.467
The quizzes are great.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.860
You know I'm a sucker

16:31.903 --> 16:33.253
for limited circulation
magazines.

16:33.296 --> 16:36.430
Simryn, why would you not
just tell us?

16:36.473 --> 16:39.302
I didn't want you to feel likeI didn't earn it.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.739
I know how much you valuehard work.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.959
We all do.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.265
How many times
have you heard

16:45.308 --> 16:47.615
how he wouldn't have
gotten out of the village

16:47.658 --> 16:48.920
without pulling himself up
by his bootstraps?

16:48.964 --> 16:50.661
I had to share my bootstraps
with, like, uh...

16:50.705 --> 16:51.401
All 30 cousins.All 30 cousins.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.099
Okay, fine.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.275
But we still don't want you
to lie to us.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.233
Yes.
I agree with your father.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.322
Unless you're dating
that tall dummy out there.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.671
In which case,
please lie.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.550
Oh, hello, my wife.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
I'm not in the mood,

17:11.160 --> 17:12.509
and why are there so many?

17:12.553 --> 17:13.989
It's Lactaid.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.295
You were right about Emery.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.123
You deserve ice cream,but not just home ice cream.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.342
The kind high-schoolersget on an innocent date

17:19.386 --> 17:21.083
before they ravage
each other.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.258
It's fine.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.782
Emery working
is reward enough.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.263
No, I found a new spotat the mall that's so fancy

17:27.307 --> 17:29.135
they spell "shop"with two Ps and an E.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.962
Shop-puh-pee.
Shop-pee.

17:31.006 --> 17:34.879
Shop-- Shop-pay -- Shop--Shop-pee-pee -- puh-pee.

17:34.923 --> 17:35.663
Shop-puh-pee.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.151
Wandering eyes, Jessica.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.152
There a good-looking man
over there?

17:48.023 --> 17:49.285
Yes.

17:49.329 --> 17:52.549
A good-looking adult manwe definitely don't know.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.117
Wow.
You're really looking.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.250
He must be sexy.
Oh!

17:57.293 --> 17:58.164
Thank you for this,
Louis.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.817
Thank you.I've really enjoyed it.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.776
Let's go.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.344
No, not before I tell you
that you are an amazing mother

18:04.387 --> 18:06.389
and a great role model
for our children.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.957
The way you knew Emery
needed consequences --

18:09.000 --> 18:10.306
Mom? Dad? Hey!

18:13.179 --> 18:16.356
Jessica, why am I at the mall
looking at my son's nipples?

18:22.797 --> 18:23.711
Hey, buddy.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.365
Pro tip --

18:25.408 --> 18:27.715
bun tans only workif you pull your shorts down.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.326
I'm mad at you --
and myself.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.416
I really wish I had sanitized
this chair before I laid down.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.419
I'm sorry if I made you feellike you're not awesome.

18:36.463 --> 18:39.292
Because there's no oneawesomer.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.945
"Awesomer"
is not a word.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.860
Or maybe it is.
Who knows?

18:42.904 --> 18:44.427
I'm no natural.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.169
Whoa.it looks like you were grilled.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.432
Oh, I guess I'm not
a natural tanner, either.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.826
Evan, being a naturaldoesn't matter.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.219
Really?

18:53.262 --> 18:54.350
Please black out
and enlighten me.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.614
You have the greatestnatural talent of all --

18:57.658 --> 18:59.181
your work ethic.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.009
That's what makes youso special.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.967
And how is that special?

19:03.011 --> 19:05.231
Anyone can get luckyevery now and then,

19:05.274 --> 19:06.754
but your focuswill help you succeed

19:06.797 --> 19:08.669
in anything you want.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.454
That's why you got to getback in that spelling bee

19:11.498 --> 19:12.977
and bring home
the Iron Man.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.110
Deal.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.418
But if you do wind up
in my guest house,

19:18.461 --> 19:19.767
I'm not splurging on permits,

19:19.810 --> 19:21.377
so if the plumbing
breaks down,

19:21.421 --> 19:22.204
you're on your own.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.470
Better head
to the shower.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.429
Gonna take extra soap
to get all this oil off.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.474
Uhp, I don't think
the Lactaid worked.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.562
I got to go, too.

19:32.606 --> 19:33.650
Oh, please.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.261
You took a double dose.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.566
Why didn't you tell me

19:36.610 --> 19:38.829
Emery's working at
a half-nude clothing outlet?

19:38.873 --> 19:42.224
You knew pushing Emery too hardwould lead to a bad choice.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.225
But you did it anyway,

19:43.269 --> 19:44.444
and now our son
is selling his body.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.010
Well,just from the waist up.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.230
Fine.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.232
I was wrong.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.147
I just wanted to help himfigure it out.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.583
Well, I was wrong, too.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.107
Emery's older now
and needs to learn

19:56.151 --> 19:58.284
the real world
has consequences.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.590
When you think about it,we were both half-right.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.463
And I admitted it first,so I was first half-right.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.116
Sure.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.294
Here's a tiffin
for your ride home.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.904
Some rice, vegetables,
and a samosa

20:09.947 --> 20:12.472
for each one of you.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.038
It's likea triangle hot pocket.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.475
Do you want
this nice container back?

20:15.518 --> 20:17.259
'Cause I guarantee
my mom's gonna steal it.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.392
Smart mom.

20:19.435 --> 20:20.436
Hey,
if you guys are available,

20:20.480 --> 20:21.698
you should come
to the spelling bee.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.700
You got it.
Bring it in, Evan.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.963
Dad, what are you doing?We don't hug.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.443
Mina: He's frisking him
for stolen shampoos.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.924
Okay.Have a safe trip, boys.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.534
He's clean.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.448
Thank you.
It was delicious.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.190
Mm.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.337
Hello, Evan.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.947
Guetapens.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.644
Please use it
in a sentence.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.559
I still can't believeyou haven't told Mom

20:56.603 --> 20:58.300
about your 1500.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.563
Um, I figured
it was Evan's day.
Oh.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.435
That's so nice of you.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.437
Also, I'm saving it
just in case

21:04.480 --> 21:07.004
things get out of hand
at South Padre.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.791
G-U-E-T-A-P-E-N-S.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.096
Guetapens.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.446
Man: That is correct.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.230
Yes, Evan!

21:16.536 --> 21:18.233
Does he get a trophy?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.495
You get a ribbon
and a certificate

21:19.539 --> 21:21.410
that won't fitin a standard frame.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.543
These kids think
they're so smart.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.196
Good luck
in the apocalypse.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.981
They'll bethe first ones eaten.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.374
Think that's a good idea.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.549
Hmm.
