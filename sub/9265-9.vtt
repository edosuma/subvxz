He's a cowboy.
He's gonna do the rodeo circuit.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.731
- <i>Are you gonna be faithful to me?</i>
- I'm gonna try.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.063
- What's all this?
- I'm going with you.

00:27.188 --> 00:28.219
Really?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.946
Let Matt play on
wide receiver this year.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.657
He thinks like a QB,
you should at least give him a shot.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.493
I'm gonna take a little trip to New York
and get a job in a sports agency

00:36.662 --> 00:39.523
with my friend Grant that I met,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.915
Texas forever?

00:41.590 --> 00:42.763
Texas forever.

00:43.121 --> 00:44.126
All right.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.920
You're always gonna be
my best friend.

00:50.164 --> 00:52.092
- This is perfect, right here.
- Right.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.077
- Thank you, sir, it's all yours.
- Thank you, sir.

01:00.299 --> 01:01.370
Thank you.

01:12.453 --> 01:13.527
My God!

01:30.629 --> 01:32.382
Guess who's paying for my truck?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.227
Whatever it takes, Billy,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.550
you're paying for it, to get it back to
better condition than where I left it.

01:37.675 --> 01:40.182
Three days!
I leave for three days, Billy!

01:40.765 --> 01:42.888
You're a write-off, too.
Look at you!

01:43.013 --> 01:45.061
- What I am...
- She dumped me.

01:46.543 --> 01:48.440
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.

01:49.197 --> 01:50.449
Mindy dumped me.

01:52.716 --> 01:54.256
The wedding's off.

01:55.453 --> 01:56.796
Sorry to hear that.

01:59.006 --> 02:00.377
You, uh...

02:01.481 --> 02:02.871
You wanna talk about it?

02:08.612 --> 02:10.151
Sorry about your truck.

02:13.664 --> 02:16.052
Throw it, throw it.
Good arm.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.651
Now that you've got that,
I've got Mr. Bear.

02:18.776 --> 02:20.624
- Good morning.
- Morning.

02:21.795 --> 02:24.118
Who put the milk away all empty?

02:24.897 --> 02:27.229
What? Gracie is trying
to tell me something.

02:27.354 --> 02:30.190
Gracie and Mr. Bear inform me
someone's birthday is coming up.

02:31.299 --> 02:33.234
I don't know
whose birthday that would be.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.336
- It certainly isn't mine.
- Yes, it is!

02:35.461 --> 02:37.909
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna have my birthday this year.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.082
I think I've decided against it.

02:40.671 --> 02:42.520
- You what?
- Against your birthday?

02:42.645 --> 02:43.953
Yeah, you know what?

02:44.122 --> 02:46.772
It's just, I think,
better not to have it.

02:47.827 --> 02:48.907
I feel old.

02:49.209 --> 02:52.193
I feel like if I have a birthday,
Gracie Belle is gonna have a birthday,

02:52.318 --> 02:55.035
and you're gonna have a birthday.
I think it's just better not to.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.708
It'd be the best present
you can give me.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.552
Agreed?

03:00.971 --> 03:02.821
We gotta leave in 5 minutes.

03:03.155 --> 03:06.768
All right, listen up! It's the playoffs,
gentlemen. This is where the fun begins.

03:06.938 --> 03:10.376
For those of you who've been out here
before, you know what I'm talking about.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.565
For those of you who haven't...

03:13.231 --> 03:14.315
you will.

03:15.245 --> 03:18.202
I want y'all to think back to September
when we played Arnett Mead.

03:18.327 --> 03:20.531
I'll tell y'all something.
We were a good team back then,

03:20.656 --> 03:22.604
but we are a better team now.

03:23.243 --> 03:25.398
Y'all look at each player
around you.

03:25.523 --> 03:28.218
You take a close look, you think about
what you've been through this year.

03:28.343 --> 03:31.536
You think about the good, about the bad,
you just think about that, gentlemen,

03:31.661 --> 03:34.212
and then you ask yourselves
this one question:

03:34.887 --> 03:37.507
how much are you willing to sacrifice
of yourselves out on this field?

03:39.118 --> 03:41.177
I guarantee
the answer to that question

03:41.728 --> 03:43.555
will determine the outcome
of this game.

03:46.738 --> 03:49.088
Let's have a good practice,
let's go!

03:52.236 --> 03:54.233
Blue, 80, set, hut!

03:54.651 --> 03:55.693
Get off the line!

03:58.531 --> 04:01.789
Hey, Ned, what are you doing?
Put a body on him, let's go!

04:01.914 --> 04:04.450
That's my fault. I told 'em not to
touch him so he doesn't get hurt.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.191
If he's gonna be a receiver, he's
gonna have to take some hits.

04:07.316 --> 04:09.998
Matt, you wanna take some hits there,
or you wanna take it real easy like?

04:10.208 --> 04:12.210
Blue, 80, set, hut!

04:25.922 --> 04:27.516
Coach! Eric!

04:28.226 --> 04:30.393
- Eric! One minute.
- Get back here!

04:30.563 --> 04:33.062
You're gonna want to hear this,
I promise. Hey, boys!

04:33.231 --> 04:36.716
- Everyone should hear this.
- Guys, we didn't wanna say anything,

04:36.841 --> 04:40.236
because we weren't sure what was
gonna happen, but we just got the call,

04:40.800 --> 04:44.783
the TV people have picked
the Dillon Panthers to be

04:44.951 --> 04:48.202
the High School Game of the Week.
Now, what that means is, Friday night,

04:48.371 --> 04:51.206
you're gonna be playing
on national television, baby!

04:57.579 --> 04:59.464
Are you ready for some football?

05:03.304 --> 05:06.554
3x09: GAME OF THE WEEK

05:08.351 --> 05:11.601

05:11.770 --> 05:15.022
benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb,
Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac, TVnut

05:57.950 --> 05:59.715
You got an idea what this is?

06:00.183 --> 06:02.820
<i>... to receive a full credit
for community service,</i>

06:02.988 --> 06:05.863
<i>you may sign up for that

06:06.248 --> 06:08.157
<i>outside of Mr. Conahan's class.</i>

06:09.207 --> 06:12.495
I'm sure y'all have probably noticed
this morning we've got some interesting

06:12.664 --> 06:16.306
<i>visitors around the school,
and I am pleased to announce</i>

06:16.877 --> 06:19.585
that, on behalf of Coach Taylor
and the football team,

06:20.220 --> 06:23.956
our game against Arnett Mead
on Friday night

06:24.081 --> 06:26.510
is going to be
on national television.

06:29.182 --> 06:32.016
<i>So that's real exciting news
for all of us,</i>

06:32.184 --> 06:34.684
<i>it's gonna be a great opportunity
for the school and for Dillon,</i>

06:34.962 --> 06:37.730
<i>and I know y'all are gonna

06:38.302 --> 06:39.981
<i>so everybody,
each and everyone of you,</i>

06:40.151 --> 06:41.983
get out there and make me proud.

06:42.623 --> 06:44.135
<i>Have a great day, today.</i>

06:46.947 --> 06:48.197
All right, smile, y'all.

06:48.836 --> 06:52.201
Thanks, folks. Enjoy the rodeo.
I'll just check out the board.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.416
- Yes! I'm riding Estop!
- Good.

06:57.914 --> 06:59.857
- That's money, baby.
- Steak dinner tonight?

06:59.982 --> 07:01.086
{\- Hey, Cash!
- }Hey, buddy.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.882
- Might I have your autograph, please?
- Yes, you can.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.553
Sit on up there, man.

07:05.678 --> 07:07.550
Let my girl get a good look at you.

07:08.953 --> 07:12.347
- Hey, I saw you ride at Nashville.
- I appreciate your support.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.971
All right, enjoy the rodeo.

07:14.096 --> 07:16.735
- Thanks, Cash.
- No problem, buddy, see ya.

07:16.860 --> 07:19.292
- That was me a long time ago.
- I'm sure it was.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.938
Hey, Cash!
Come over here.

07:21.226 --> 07:23.775
This is Brooke, right here.
Hey, Brooke, how you been?

07:24.029 --> 07:26.480
- Who's this pretty girl?
- This is my girlfriend, Tyra.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.988
Hi, Tyra. What are you doing
without boots and a hat?

07:29.563 --> 07:31.699
Well, <i>real</i> boots and a hat.
Come over here.

07:32.059 --> 07:34.660
You guys have some fun girl time,
I'll see you in a bit. 

07:35.214 --> 07:37.366
You go do your thing,
I've got her under control. 

07:37.491 --> 07:39.749
OK, let's get you a hat.
Come over here.

07:39.919 --> 07:42.436
So, how long have you two
been going out?

07:42.561 --> 07:45.426
- A while, I guess.
- Well, you're a very lucky girl

07:45.586 --> 07:48.217
'cause he is quite a catch.

07:49.854 --> 07:51.803
So, what do you do?
Barrel racing, roping?

07:52.308 --> 07:54.306
I'm a waitress, actually.

07:55.797 --> 07:58.083
Good for you.
All right, so...

07:58.250 --> 07:59.535
What do you think?

08:00.655 --> 08:02.317
I love it, but...

08:02.484 --> 08:04.023
I can't afford any of this stuff.

08:05.225 --> 08:06.442
We'll lie them on Cash.

08:06.746 --> 08:09.695
The money I win from this,
I will pay you, calm down.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.741
- Does your mom still pack your lunch?
- No. How're your steak fingers?

08:12.866 --> 08:14.075
So where is Tyra?

08:15.882 --> 08:17.912
I don't know,
am I supposed to know where Tyra is?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.446
She's been missing for a week,
I need to talk to her.

08:20.571 --> 08:22.845
Well, if you want,
you could probably give her a call,

08:22.970 --> 08:26.099
- I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.
- She picked a bad week to be ditching.

08:26.224 --> 08:28.589
Winter formal is in 3 weeks
and we don't have a theme.

08:29.511 --> 08:32.260
What are y'all gonna do...
without a theme?

08:32.429 --> 08:35.847
She's president of the student council
and she keeps blowing off our meetings.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.356
If you talk to her,
tell her to give me a call.

08:38.481 --> 08:40.393
Otherwise, we're gonna pick
a theme without her.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.903
You don't wanna do that.

08:46.451 --> 08:48.901
They're gonna pick
a theme without her.

08:49.527 --> 08:53.424
Have you seen Tyra? I mean, she has
been gone for a while, it seems like.

08:53.851 --> 08:55.992
I think she said her aunt was sick.

09:00.316 --> 09:02.582
Well, I'm sure that
she's fine wherever she is...

09:03.048 --> 09:04.119
you know.

09:06.334 --> 09:09.084
- He has a girlfriend, now?
- Mental note!

09:10.384 --> 09:11.621
- Tim!
- Yeah.

09:11.746 --> 09:12.947
Mr. Riggins.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.766
- Scotty Simms, San Antonio State.
- How you doing?

09:15.891 --> 09:17.611
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

09:18.147 --> 09:20.492
I'm the one who's been sending
those recruiting letters.

09:20.617 --> 09:22.119
You're a hard man to track down.

09:22.244 --> 09:24.530
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I meant to call you.

09:24.655 --> 09:26.981
We've been, like, there's practice
and State coming...

09:27.150 --> 09:30.318
Don't worry about it, I know
what it's like, you got a lot going on.

09:30.955 --> 09:33.153
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- I'm Lyla.

09:33.278 --> 09:34.696
{\- Sorry. Lyla, Scotty Simms.
- }Nice to meet you.

09:34.821 --> 09:36.972
So, listen, I don't mean
to blindside you like this,

09:37.097 --> 09:40.703
but like I said in my letters, we're
graduating our entire backfield in June.

09:41.554 --> 09:44.457
We really feel like you'd be
a great fit for our team next year.

09:44.746 --> 09:46.918
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the Marriott next few days.

09:47.489 --> 09:50.463
Come by tomorrow night. We'll have
a sit-down, talk about our program?

09:50.780 --> 09:53.740
- Tomorrow night isn't a good...
- They make a hell of a rib eye.

09:53.865 --> 09:56.882
Tomorrow night's not really good, sir.
My truck's in the shop, right now...

09:57.007 --> 09:58.930
I'll give you a ride.
I'll give him a ride.

09:59.958 --> 10:01.637
Great.
Eight o'clock?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.518
Yeah, sounds good.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.912
{\- All right, see you then.
- }See you then.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.216
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

10:08.836 --> 10:10.241
Scotty Simms...

10:21.036 --> 10:23.885
Hey, Jen.
Can I see Jules for a second, please?

10:25.415 --> 10:26.415
Come here.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.917
Thanks.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.992
If l could just be a second...
Come on, hurry up.

10:32.117 --> 10:34.065
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

10:35.345 --> 10:36.369
Listen,

10:36.697 --> 10:39.195
Friday night, all right,
after the game...

10:39.885 --> 10:42.139
I've set up a reservation at a hotel
for your mother and I.

10:42.553 --> 10:44.446
It's a little surprise for her,
all right?

10:44.571 --> 10:47.812
I'm gonna get some champagne, flowers,
chocolate, so we can spend some time...

10:47.981 --> 10:50.439
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Here's what I need from you.

10:50.649 --> 10:54.201
While mom's not looking, set up
an overnight bag for her, all right?

10:54.538 --> 10:56.737
The other thing is, I need
for you to look after Gracie.

10:56.862 --> 10:59.277
- Can you do that?
- I can set up the bag and watch Gracie,

10:59.402 --> 11:02.528
but dad, I'm pretty sure mom didn't want
her birthday being celebrated at all.

11:02.653 --> 11:04.102
That's her problem.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.901
- You're good with Gracie?
- I'm good with Gracie.

11:07.026 --> 11:08.277
Thanks, thanks.

11:08.759 --> 11:11.091
- Get back to your Shakespeare.
- Dad, it's math class.

11:11.216 --> 11:14.396
- Tell Mr. Newton I say hello.
- Dad, Mr. Newton's not...

11:24.236 --> 11:25.260
Yeah, baby!

11:26.102 --> 11:27.060
Go, Cash!

11:38.551 --> 11:40.712
That's it, baby, that's it!

11:47.474 --> 11:51.245
<i>7-9, 79!
Cash Waller takes second place!</i>

11:54.810 --> 11:57.172
- Baby, that was so good.
- Stow that, all right, honey?

11:57.297 --> 12:01.076
Second place is the first loser.
That's not good enough at all!

12:14.068 --> 12:16.192
- You should eat that in the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

12:17.478 --> 12:19.769
- I was too tired to get a plate.
- I'll get you one.

12:19.894 --> 12:22.531
This is my house and Matthew can eat
wherever he wants to.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.326
Grandma, that's OK.
I should probably eat in there anyway.

12:25.496 --> 12:28.619
- You can eat wherever you want to.
- Maybe I should use a plate.

12:28.744 --> 12:29.872
This is just dirty.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.168
- Here's a plate.
- Thank you.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.606
And when are you leaving?

12:35.578 --> 12:37.052
- Excuse me?
- I mean it.

12:37.177 --> 12:39.256
How much longer is she planning
on being around here?

12:42.144 --> 12:45.888
Well, since you brought it up...
I think it's OK, we should discuss it.

12:46.404 --> 12:49.058
- What?
- Matthew might go to college next year.

12:49.475 --> 12:51.894
And I think that's so great,
and I told him that

12:52.064 --> 12:54.026
if he did get into college,
that I could help

12:54.151 --> 12:56.691
take care of you, and I'd probably
be staying here a lot longer, then.

12:59.462 --> 13:00.611
Maybe, just maybe.

13:01.946 --> 13:02.947
You two...

13:03.855 --> 13:06.569
have been talking about me,
in my house...

13:06.694 --> 13:07.887
No, not like...

13:08.012 --> 13:09.090
Haven't you?

13:11.032 --> 13:13.833
Well, you know what?
That's just about the worst idea

13:14.003 --> 13:16.878
- I ever heard and I'm not having it.
- Lorraine, calm down.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.755
I'm not gonna calm down, missy.
Not at all.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.583
Matthew is not going anywhere,
he wouldn't do that.

13:23.198 --> 13:25.761
I think that's a little bit selfish,
you know,

13:25.931 --> 13:28.397
after everything
that Matthew's done for you...

13:28.808 --> 13:32.197
Me? Selfish?
We wanna talk about who's selfish?

13:32.322 --> 13:34.537
You can't expect him
to stay here forever.

13:34.662 --> 13:37.523
- He's a kid with a whole life to live.
- You know what? You're the devil.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.801
No, no... Really.

13:39.926 --> 13:42.278
The first day I met her, I knew.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.236
She ruined your daddy.

13:44.361 --> 13:46.228
That's a horrible thing to say.

13:46.353 --> 13:48.743
She would have ruined you
if I hadn't been here!

13:48.913 --> 13:51.625
- That's enough.
- No! Get away from me, both of you!

13:51.750 --> 13:54.290
Now, let me tell you something
right now.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.750
You can get rid of me,
but don't leave me with her.

13:57.549 --> 13:58.756
You promise me,

13:58.881 --> 14:02.605
if you really want to, get rid of me,
but don't leave me with her.

14:08.463 --> 14:10.665
You can't listen to her
when she talks like this.

14:10.790 --> 14:13.848
She doesn't... even know
what she's talking about.

14:26.705 --> 14:29.002
So the angle that I'm gonna go for

14:29.127 --> 14:31.368
is that it's really
about climate change.

14:32.412 --> 14:33.746
Am I boring you?

14:33.916 --> 14:36.665
It's my shoulder, it's killing me,
so I just kinda...

14:36.835 --> 14:39.382
It's from getting hit all the time
at practice?

14:39.542 --> 14:42.647
I kinda hope we lose on Friday
so your daddy gets off my back and

14:42.772 --> 14:45.633
- stops having everyone beat up on me.
- You know what he's doing, right?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.415
- Being a jerk?
- No.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.993
He's trying to motivate you.
It's like basic psychology.

14:50.118 --> 14:52.139
- He probably read it in a book.
- It's not working.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.144
Hey, Matt, you're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.424
Some lady just asked me

14:57.549 --> 15:01.398
to do an interview for her tomorrow.
I guess she's some sort of

15:01.568 --> 15:03.234
- producer or director.
- For what?

15:03.404 --> 15:06.295
For the profile on the Panthers team,
the pre-game stuff.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.802
Apparently, I'm gonna speak
as a scholar-athlete.

15:08.927 --> 15:11.283
- You're a scholar-athlete?
- I never thought about it, but...

15:11.453 --> 15:14.081
- They want to interview <i>you</i> ?
- I gotta go rehearse

15:14.206 --> 15:16.556
or figure out
what I'm gonna talk about,

15:17.077 --> 15:19.792
- you know? Ain't that cool, Matt?
- Yeah.

15:22.719 --> 15:24.243
I gotta get to class.

15:33.368 --> 15:35.791
I was gonna name
my first-born after you.

15:35.916 --> 15:38.812
I was gonna name it Timmy.
Seriously, man, even if it was...

15:39.023 --> 15:40.023
a girl.

15:40.726 --> 15:41.777
I mean that.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.766
That's sweet of you.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.068
- Cheers.
- Cheers, no regrets.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.278
No regrets.

15:49.077 --> 15:51.616
- That one hurt.
- Didn't sit right.

15:52.137 --> 15:54.034
Beer me right now.
Beer it.

15:58.869 --> 16:01.458
I've been honking
and screaming outside

16:01.628 --> 16:04.253
- for about 5 minutes.
- Sorry, I lost track of time.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.880
Just been...
tending to Billy and his broken heart.

16:08.446 --> 16:10.507
- I'm ready.
- You want a drink?

16:10.790 --> 16:13.278
You have an appointment
in about 15 minutes.

16:13.529 --> 16:15.723
You know, when you talk
close to me like that,

16:16.457 --> 16:18.267
we should just go have a shower.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.768
You have an appointment in 15 minutes.
This is important.

16:20.893 --> 16:22.771
- I'm ready.
- I can't believe you're drinking.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.566
I'm not drinking.
I had a shot and half a beer.

16:25.736 --> 16:28.824
Riggins is in his game face.
Putting my game face on.

16:30.246 --> 16:31.405
I'm serious.
I'm good.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.045
- I'll be in the car.
- I was gonna tell him, you know,

16:35.170 --> 16:37.161
"you need to get ready
'cause you got your meeting"

16:37.606 --> 16:39.659
- and everything, but...
- Well done, Billy.

16:40.105 --> 16:42.917
He's gonna do fine.
I mean, it's gonna be awesome.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.599
- So you knew about the meeting?
- I forgot, but...

16:45.724 --> 16:47.197
- You forgot?
- I knew.

16:47.364 --> 16:48.364
You knew...

16:49.430 --> 16:50.632
You're a mess.

16:52.638 --> 16:54.345
Sorry about Mindy, too, by the way.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.155
A few things are
that it was founded in 1917

17:02.329 --> 17:06.106
and their big thing is
small classroom sizes,

17:06.276 --> 17:08.892
- and student-faculty ratio...
- You're absolutely right, but I...

17:09.017 --> 17:12.529
I  think he's just gonna want to talk
about football. That's probably just it.

17:12.843 --> 17:14.730
- But it doesn't...
- Keep it simple, you know?

17:14.855 --> 17:16.950
hurt to be informed
about the school, so that maybe...

17:17.445 --> 17:20.500
Well, yeah, I just...
It's not really a job interview, so...

17:20.877 --> 17:23.595
Actually, that's exactly what it is.

17:26.736 --> 17:28.990
- I know what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

17:29.115 --> 17:33.022
With avoiding all the meetings,
and the drinking with your brother...

17:33.423 --> 17:35.270
- You're afraid.
- Afraid?

17:35.395 --> 17:38.514
You're afraid that, you know,
if it doesn't work out

17:38.684 --> 17:41.322
for some reason,
that you'll feel like a failure, but...

17:42.137 --> 17:45.474
To be honest with you, what I'm really
afraid of is that if it does work out,

17:45.599 --> 17:47.401
then I have to go to college.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.525
You have a shot at being
the only Riggins

17:49.953 --> 17:52.278
to go to college.
That's huge!

17:53.862 --> 17:55.614
What are you laughing at?
At me?

17:55.784 --> 17:58.706
OK, kinda, sorta.
Because these meetings are crap.

17:59.242 --> 18:03.038
They get you alone, they hot-box you,
fill you up with empty promises,

18:03.248 --> 18:05.207
and that's about it,
it's a waste of time.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.097
- Waste of time?
- I can't wait.

18:07.222 --> 18:09.186
I'm excited for my free steak.

18:09.674 --> 18:11.677
- I have nothing to be scared of.
- I'm an idiot.

18:13.298 --> 18:15.083
No, I am! I'm an idiot

18:15.208 --> 18:17.177
because I thought
that you actually cared

18:17.347 --> 18:18.938
and you don't care about any of it.

18:19.063 --> 18:22.380
You don't care about the meeting,
or about your future. None of it!

18:22.505 --> 18:24.648
I'm trying to do some research
before my big meeting.

18:24.773 --> 18:26.082
Get out of my car.

18:27.512 --> 18:29.586
- Seriously?
- This is not a joke.

18:29.887 --> 18:32.061
Get out of my car.
Out...

18:32.997 --> 18:33.997
of my car.

18:35.693 --> 18:38.634
I don't appreciate being laughed at.
I was just trying to help.

18:38.759 --> 18:39.950
Get out of my car.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.103
OK, but...

18:43.083 --> 18:45.275
- I don't have my coat.
- Get out of my car, Tim!

18:45.400 --> 18:48.125
- So if I get a cold... 
- You're drunk, so you'll be warm.

18:48.382 --> 18:50.586
I got the playoffs.
I might get sick!

18:51.507 --> 18:52.695
Shut the door!

18:56.699 --> 18:58.372
You actually gonna leave?

19:00.269 --> 19:01.269
For real?

19:06.705 --> 19:08.455
OK, seriously, it's cold.

19:08.871 --> 19:11.398
I don't understand.
You're still going to Houston...

19:11.854 --> 19:14.099
Houston's in three weeks.
Screw Houston.

19:16.178 --> 19:17.290
OK, you know what?

19:17.415 --> 19:19.178
We need to get out
of this hotel room.

19:19.303 --> 19:21.360
Let's go get something to eat,
I'm starving.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.914
We're not going to get
something to eat.

19:25.615 --> 19:27.915
- You're acting like a little baby!
- I'm acting like a baby?

19:28.085 --> 19:30.959
- Yes, 2 grand is a lot of money!
- Two grand's not enough money!

19:32.737 --> 19:34.129
Look, I'm sorry, but...

19:34.396 --> 19:36.717
you know that guy I was getting
heated with the other day?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.495
That's 'cause I owe him
a lot of money.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.780
And if I don't pay him back, guess
what's gonna happen. Can you guess?

19:41.905 --> 19:43.357
Can you fathom all that?

19:44.122 --> 19:45.122
Thank you.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.646
- How much money?
- A lot more than 2 grand, all right?

19:51.648 --> 19:54.441
This isn't high school.
This is the real world, Tyra!

19:54.797 --> 19:57.111
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- What am I gonna say?

19:57.281 --> 20:01.044
You want me to sugarcoat this?
'Cause this is what's really happening!

20:02.385 --> 20:03.500
You know what?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.897
Don't worry about it,
I'll figure it out...

20:06.022 --> 20:08.179
- Where're you going?
- I'm gonna get some fresh air.

20:08.304 --> 20:09.315
Dammit!

20:09.440 --> 20:11.668
Should I turn my chair?
Is this gonna be...

20:11.793 --> 20:14.455
No, you just look at me. OK,
associate editor of the school paper,

20:14.580 --> 20:18.048
volunteer tutor, and you're also
in the Physics Club, right?

20:19.054 --> 20:20.384
Technically, not anymore,

20:20.554 --> 20:22.965
'cause there was only two of us,
me and one other person.

20:23.187 --> 20:25.575
- But I did start the Physics Club.
- All right, great, great!

20:26.184 --> 20:28.141
- What's your GPA?
- It's actually a 4.6,

20:28.266 --> 20:30.349
but are we gonna talk
about football, 'cause I'm on...

20:30.474 --> 20:32.520
Oh yeah, but this is good stuff,

20:32.756 --> 20:35.198
this whole student athlete angle
is very inspiring.

20:35.323 --> 20:37.234
Sorry, can I take this for one second?
Hello?

20:37.404 --> 20:39.152
- It'll be just one second.
- Sure.

20:40.029 --> 20:41.310
It's... It's me.

20:44.545 --> 20:46.118
What are you doing?

20:48.068 --> 20:51.253
I'm just getting ready to do
this interview... thing, here.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.417
Really? You're gonna do an interview?

20:56.050 --> 20:59.840
They're doing this thing for the
Panthers, so they asked me to do it.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.521
<i>So that's what I'm doing.</i>

21:01.646 --> 21:04.177
<i>What are you doing?
Where are you at?</i>

21:04.302 --> 21:05.534
Well...

21:06.742 --> 21:08.094
I'm actually in Dallas.

21:11.507 --> 21:13.825
<i>Cash had a rodeo,
so I came with him.</i>

21:15.281 --> 21:16.281
It's, um...

21:18.132 --> 21:19.582
It's raining, here.

21:20.386 --> 21:22.687
- <i>Is everything all right or...</i>
- Yeah!

21:22.812 --> 21:24.948
Everything's fine.
I just...

21:27.100 --> 21:30.287
- I wanted to hear a familiar voice.
- <i>You know,</i>

21:30.457 --> 21:33.457
April Keegan is
frantically searching for you.

21:34.315 --> 21:37.665
<i>She wants to get a theme
straightened out for the dance,</i>

21:37.978 --> 21:39.338
<i>she keeps bugging me about it,</i>

21:39.680 --> 21:42.257
- so it'd be nice if you talked to her.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:43.271 --> 21:45.821
I know. I'll get on that,
I'll call her.

21:46.401 --> 21:48.263
It'll be my next priority.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.098
- 'Cause I know...
- Mr. Clarke?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.006
<i>Can I get one more second? I'll be
right over. We're about to start?</i>

21:53.131 --> 21:55.562
- Do you need to go?
- It's OK. I think it's fine.

21:56.236 --> 21:58.690
I don't want you to miss
your big interview. You should go.

21:59.588 --> 22:00.588
You sure?

22:01.027 --> 22:03.695
I'm fine. Everything's fine.
I just, you know...

22:05.105 --> 22:06.212
Break a leg!

22:07.128 --> 22:08.278
All right, bye.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.175
What up, Garrity?

22:33.931 --> 22:34.971
Hey, Mindy.

22:38.348 --> 22:40.291
I heard about you and Billy.

22:41.331 --> 22:42.397
I'm sorry.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.242
What happened?

22:47.483 --> 22:49.401
He's a dumbass,
that's what happened.

22:49.526 --> 22:51.618
- Right.
- Wanted me to quit working.

22:52.950 --> 22:53.745
Really?

22:54.029 --> 22:56.572
And I'm like, all right, genius,
so you're gonna support us now?

22:56.697 --> 22:59.361
That boy hasn't held a job for more
than a month since I've known him.

22:59.486 --> 23:01.617
Yeah, well, they're both idiots.

23:02.028 --> 23:05.674
Big plan in the future for them is like,
what kind of beer they want on Sunday.

23:07.508 --> 23:10.203
- Trouble in paradise with Wonderboy?
- Yeah, we're in a fight.

23:10.328 --> 23:11.753
We're in a fight, because...

23:11.878 --> 23:15.302
he had this recruiter interested in him,
he kept blowing him off and just...

23:15.427 --> 23:17.392
He's just... being typical Riggins.

23:18.207 --> 23:20.499
- So you're not going to the game?
- No.

23:20.894 --> 23:21.917
No game.

23:26.704 --> 23:28.238
Feel like hanging out?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.679
<i>Tonight, only one team survives.</i>

23:38.804 --> 23:40.710
<i>It's win, or go home.</i>

23:40.835 --> 23:43.712
<i>With four victories needed
to reach the ultimate dream,</i>

23:44.034 --> 23:46.340
<i>the Texas state football title.</i>

23:46.766 --> 23:49.384
<i>It's the SHSC High School
Football Game of the Week,</i>

23:49.698 --> 23:53.638
<i>and tonight, the Dillon Panthers
host the Arnett Mead Tigers.</i>

24:08.600 --> 24:10.781
<i>It appears the glare
of this national spotlight</i>

24:10.951 --> 24:13.992
<i>has these Dillon receivers
dazed and confused.</i>

24:18.126 --> 24:20.290
<i>Incomplete on a busted route,</i>

24:20.460 --> 24:22.959
<i>and the Panthers are forced to punt.</i>

24:23.129 --> 24:26.784
<i>Todd Jenkins is really struggling
with this spread offense tonight, folks.</i>

24:26.909 --> 24:28.799
<i>Arnett Mead over the ball...</i>

24:30.637 --> 24:33.534
<i>Inside hand-off,
he cuts to the outside, he's got a lane!</i>

24:33.659 --> 24:36.848
<i>He's got a cut in, touchdown!
Reservation for six,</i>

24:37.228 --> 24:39.351
<i>Arnett Mead, touchdown.</i>

24:40.438 --> 24:41.853
Let's go now, let's go!

24:42.459 --> 24:44.309
<i>Panthers back on offense.</i>

24:44.803 --> 24:47.192
<i>J.D. McCoy takes the snap,
he steps back...</i>

24:48.480 --> 24:51.238
<i>he's got Bird
on the dig route, fires...</i>

24:52.166 --> 24:53.378
<i>Oh, my!</i>

24:53.910 --> 24:57.035
- What the hell is he doing?
- What are you doing? Get over here!

24:57.544 --> 24:58.728
Get outta there!

24:58.853 --> 25:00.681
Get him outta there,
give Riggins the ball!

25:00.806 --> 25:03.667
- Run the damn ball!
- How many times did you run this play?

25:03.837 --> 25:07.337
Just step around, just clear.
All you gotta do is clear!

25:08.102 --> 25:09.949
<i>McCoy opens right.
It's a drive to Riggins,</i>

25:10.074 --> 25:12.175
<i>cuts through the hole,
he's got a lane!</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:14.460
<i>Panthers down inside the 30.</i>

25:14.585 --> 25:16.254
<i>McCoy on the pitch,</i>

25:16.476 --> 25:18.682
<i>it's Riggins going wide right,
powers through...</i>

25:19.097 --> 25:22.627
<i>Down he goes, and Riggins
has the Panthers in the red zone.</i>

25:22.752 --> 25:23.770
Take it.

25:26.130 --> 25:28.483
<i>It's up, and it's right through
the middle, folks.</i>

25:28.653 --> 25:32.217
<i>That makes the score
7 to 3, Arnett Mead, at the half.</i>

25:32.342 --> 25:35.983
<i>And thank goodness for Tim Riggins,
because the Panther aerial attack</i>

25:36.108 --> 25:38.076
<i>has been completely MIA tonight.</i>

25:38.427 --> 25:40.745
You're blowing your cover,
letting them get all over you,

25:40.915 --> 25:43.331
you're like this. Just sweep off,
that's all you had to do!

25:43.501 --> 25:46.067
We do that block, defense will bunch up,
we'll shut down, OK?

25:46.192 --> 25:49.135
You understand?
All right, we go no huddle?

25:49.260 --> 25:51.310
... mistakes, you understand?
We're losing right now!

25:51.435 --> 25:53.075
Listen up, listen up!

25:57.404 --> 25:58.972
Two minutes till we go out.

26:02.897 --> 26:04.563
Y'all wanna end this season?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.399
Pack your bags, just go home,
you know where the door is.

26:09.216 --> 26:12.569
Otherwise, I suggest you wake up
and get your heads in this game.

26:14.399 --> 26:16.781
This defense is not gonna carry
this team all night long.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.117
The offense has got to execute.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.943
Or else, I guarantee you...

26:22.302 --> 26:24.915
our season ends tonight.
Understood?

26:25.362 --> 26:26.783
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

26:26.908 --> 26:28.168
Yes, sir!

26:29.339 --> 26:31.523
Let's go show me something then!

26:35.722 --> 26:37.177
Matt! Come here!

26:43.969 --> 26:46.769
<i>And here come the Panthers,
and this is interesting...</i>

26:47.066 --> 26:49.424
<i>Looks like backup quarterback
Matt Saracen</i>

26:49.549 --> 26:51.525
<i>is in the game at wide receiver.</i>

26:51.650 --> 26:53.991
<i>Now we talked about this
in the open votes. Maybe...</i>

26:55.470 --> 26:58.907
- Are you seeing this?
- Oh yes, there's Matt, look at him!

26:59.313 --> 27:01.034
It is! We gotta go!

27:01.779 --> 27:03.161
I'm gonna get my coat.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.879
- Can you get that blanket?
- Yeah. This is so great!

27:06.004 --> 27:08.875
- He didn't think he was gonna play.
- You know what? Tickets.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.595
Doesn't matter. Jerry's in my
Sunday school class, he'll let us in.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.547
- We have no problem for the tickets.
- Get your coat on right now!

27:15.026 --> 27:17.275
Wait a minute! I can handle it.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.871
- Heavens to Betsie!
- I know...

27:18.996 --> 27:21.513
I can do this myself.
Let's go.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.348
Come on!

27:25.991 --> 27:27.621
Here we go!
7, up!

27:28.434 --> 27:29.480
Go, Saracen!

27:30.568 --> 27:32.482
<i>Third quarter,
Panthers with the ball.</i>

27:33.810 --> 27:35.026
<i>McCoy steps back,</i>

27:35.905 --> 27:38.905
<i>he fires across the middle, he's got...
Saracen has the ball!</i>

27:40.034 --> 27:41.091
<i>Big hit!</i>

27:41.536 --> 27:43.910
<i>Oh, he held on!
That boy held on</i>

27:44.080 --> 27:46.413
<i>like he was holding on to his mama!
First down, Panthers.</i>

27:47.396 --> 27:49.672
<i>McCoy back to pass,
he's looking deep.</i>

27:49.797 --> 27:51.590
<i>No, it's a shovel pass to Riggins!</i>

27:51.750 --> 27:54.337
<i>He's got some open field,
one man to beat!</i>

27:54.815 --> 27:56.678
<i>Saracen makes a huge block!</i>

27:57.058 --> 27:58.660
<i>Touchdown, Panthers!</i>

27:59.110 --> 28:01.303
<i>The Panthers are scoring here
in the second half</i>

28:01.473 --> 28:04.598
<i>and Matt Saracen is making
the difference out there, folks.</i>

28:07.080 --> 28:10.478
<i>We're late in the 4th quarter,
time is running out for Arnett Mead.</i>

28:10.952 --> 28:14.529
<i>The Panthers have to get a first down
and this game is in the bag.</i>

28:16.195 --> 28:18.283
<i>It's a hand-off to Riggins
up the middle.</i>

28:18.443 --> 28:20.064
<i>Chris Cagen makes the stop.</i>

28:20.189 --> 28:23.435
<i>And that's gonna bring up
fourth down and a long seven</i>

28:23.560 --> 28:25.995
<i>as Arnett Mead
calls its last time-out.</i>

28:26.120 --> 28:29.372
Coach, let's just punt it, we're way out
of field-goal range. Good job, good try.

28:30.237 --> 28:31.499
<i>It's decision time</i>

28:31.669 --> 28:34.663
<i>for Coach Taylor and these Panthers.
They have to get this first down,</i>

28:34.788 --> 28:38.521
<i>or Arnett Mead will get the ball back
in great field position.</i>

28:39.562 --> 28:42.260
Coach Olep, let's go for it.
Let's go.

28:42.622 --> 28:45.472
- Coach, that's quite risky!
- Let's go for it.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.767
- Side right, 44, fire.
- Side right, 44, fire?

28:49.368 --> 28:50.643
That's you, 7!

28:50.813 --> 28:53.707
- Side right, 44, fire.
- All right, you heard him, let's go!

28:53.832 --> 28:55.644
You catch and we're done!

28:56.337 --> 28:57.561
<i>And here we go!</i>

28:57.686 --> 29:01.196
<i>It is white-knuckle time
as Dillon is going for it, fourth down</i>

29:01.366 --> 29:03.620
<i>and the game
hanging in the balance.</i>

29:06.471 --> 29:08.386
<i>Saracen has the ball.</i>

29:08.742 --> 29:11.039
<i>He shakes the tackler,
stays on his feet!</i>

29:11.402 --> 29:14.564
<i>He stretches out!
I don't know if he made it, folks!</i>

29:14.689 --> 29:16.315
<i>He might be short!</i>

29:22.308 --> 29:24.803
<i>First down!
Panthers have it, folks!</i>

29:24.973 --> 29:27.376
<i>They will not have
to run another play.</i>

29:27.501 --> 29:29.974
<i>Panthers win, Panthers win!</i>

29:33.311 --> 29:35.435
It was the right call.
Good call.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.017
There you go, baby.

29:39.365 --> 29:40.402
There you go.

29:54.886 --> 29:56.920
I didn't know ya'll were coming.

29:58.533 --> 30:01.178
- You were so great, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

30:01.303 --> 30:03.133
- When did y'all get here?
- A long time ago.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.039
You guys came together?

30:14.464 --> 30:18.296
Count five, Queen bets, round.

30:19.062 --> 30:21.756
Last card, gentlemen.
Pair of tens.

30:21.881 --> 30:23.138
All right, call.

30:24.254 --> 30:25.905
- Aces win.
- I'm busted, damn.

30:26.414 --> 30:27.615
Look, I need more.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.826
- You're into us kind of deep...
- Gimme more!

30:29.996 --> 30:31.828
- You know I'm good for it.
- I can't do it.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.205
Really?
This is how it's gonna be.

30:34.682 --> 30:35.834
Afraid so.

30:36.294 --> 30:37.547
The hell with you all!

30:37.707 --> 30:41.085
- I'll get some cash and I'll be back.
- You get some cash, come on back.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.757
- Are we going?
- No. Sit down! I didn't say, "get up."

30:45.033 --> 30:47.350
Sit down in that chair
and I'll be back.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.026
Why are we rushing out so fast?

31:34.691 --> 31:36.768
They wanna interview you in there.

31:36.893 --> 31:39.338
- What are you up to?
- Just get in the car...

31:39.463 --> 31:42.357
- You're very sneaky.
- You're being very suspicious.

31:43.382 --> 31:45.061
If you're not taking me
to the party,

31:45.186 --> 31:48.209
that would be the best birthday present
I could ever ask for.

31:48.334 --> 31:49.886
- Get in the car.
- OK.

31:50.011 --> 31:53.117
- That, and a clicker for the lock.
- You think a clicker is a good thing?

31:53.513 --> 31:56.568
I don't want you to weasel booze,
this time. Bring your own, you know?

31:56.693 --> 31:59.249
- Can we go get something first?
- We're not getting food right now.

31:59.544 --> 32:01.489
- Tim!
- It doesn't matter, I was just saying.

32:01.614 --> 32:03.265
- Congratulations.
- How're you doing?

32:03.390 --> 32:05.255
- You played a heck of a game.
- Thank you.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.375
- They kept it pretty interesting.
- Yeah, they did.

32:09.113 --> 32:11.728
Look, about last night,
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

32:11.915 --> 32:14.132
- Something just...
- Don't even worry about it.

32:14.257 --> 32:15.536
Here's the deal.

32:15.766 --> 32:17.976
Coach Powers called me
about you again today.

32:18.398 --> 32:21.096
He said you are
number one priority right now.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.226
- Really?
- Yeah, quote unquote.

32:24.937 --> 32:29.028
How about you let me buy you a quick pop
and you keep me from losing my job?

32:34.682 --> 32:38.162
I love that. You are...
I love you, honey. Look at...

32:38.332 --> 32:40.248
Thank you.
Look at this beautiful...

32:40.418 --> 32:42.625
Everything with the rose petals...

32:42.795 --> 32:43.957
Honey, look!

32:45.125 --> 32:46.502
Hotel robes.

32:46.627 --> 32:48.131
- Something to steal!
- I love it.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.679
We can steal 'em.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.601
How exciting.

32:51.916 --> 32:52.975
Thank you.

32:55.078 --> 32:56.420
Happy birthday.

32:59.919 --> 33:03.339
This is the only birthday party
I could have ever wanted.

33:08.018 --> 33:10.031
Maybe we should take a shower,

33:10.156 --> 33:11.983
wash some of that game dirt off...

33:12.376 --> 33:13.820
put the robes on...

33:20.918 --> 33:23.745
Hold on, let me just get that
in case it's Jules.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.671
Or Tyra.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.856
I don't know, I better...
I just...

33:29.877 --> 33:31.567
- Mrs. Taylor?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

33:31.692 --> 33:33.440
- It's Tyra.
- <i>Hey, Tyra.</i>

33:33.662 --> 33:34.761
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:35.426 --> 33:37.476
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

33:37.933 --> 33:38.933
but, um...

33:40.948 --> 33:42.769
I'm in a little bit of trouble.

33:42.939 --> 33:44.520
What's going on?
What's the matter?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.897
- Please don't be mad, but...
- <i>I won't be mad. What's happening?</i>

33:48.022 --> 33:50.940
- I'm in Dallas right now.
- What are you doing there?

33:51.110 --> 33:53.223
I came here with Cash,
but now he's gone.

33:53.348 --> 33:55.973
I don't know where he's at,
and I don't have any money.

33:56.098 --> 33:58.322
<i>And my mama's out of town,
and I can't get ahold of Mindy,</i>

33:58.447 --> 34:01.091
- <i>and I didn't know who else to call...</i>
- I don't like that look.

34:01.216 --> 34:03.364
OK. Well, you know what?
Listen.

34:03.687 --> 34:04.958
What do you need from me?

34:05.942 --> 34:07.794
Sorry, can you come and pick me up?

34:09.415 --> 34:10.683
Yeah, I mean...

34:11.353 --> 34:14.759
Yeah, hon. Where are you right now?
Are you some place safe?

34:16.184 --> 34:18.100
I'm at the Econo Lodge

34:18.418 --> 34:19.847
at LBJ and Central.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.808
Can you stay there?
Can you lock the door?

34:21.978 --> 34:24.518
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>All right. You just stay put, OK?</i>

34:24.688 --> 34:26.521
We'll jump in the car
and come get you.

34:26.905 --> 34:29.607
<i>And you just stay there,
and keep your cell phone right by you</i>

34:29.777 --> 34:31.442
'cause I'll need to call you, OK?

34:31.797 --> 34:33.841
OK. I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

34:33.966 --> 34:36.617
<i>You just stay tight. Don't move,
all right? I'll see you soon.</i>

34:37.193 --> 34:38.199
<i>OK, bye.</i>

34:41.187 --> 34:43.837
- Maybe we can still take a shower.
- Honey...

34:44.750 --> 34:46.469
I'm so sorry. What else can we do?

34:46.594 --> 34:49.752
Honey, I'm taking the champagne,
I'm taking every bit...

34:49.922 --> 34:51.998
- of this chocolate.
- Gotta get some coffee.

34:52.123 --> 34:55.304
- Get the chocolate, that's important.
- I'm taking all of these things.

34:55.465 --> 34:58.280
I read this article in Cosmo.

34:58.716 --> 35:02.515
"More pearls, less swine." It's about
bad dating habits and how to break 'em.

35:02.779 --> 35:04.517
- I've read that one.
- Shut up! That list

35:04.732 --> 35:07.395
of toxic signs?
I swear to God, Billy's ten for ten.

35:07.671 --> 35:09.605
"Does he put his happiness
before yours?" Check.

35:10.293 --> 35:11.941
It's true, maybe you gotta...

35:12.632 --> 35:13.735
let the loser go.

35:14.868 --> 35:15.987
That's a great idea.

35:16.332 --> 35:17.999
I think that you should...

35:18.436 --> 35:20.301
I think that you should move on!

35:20.426 --> 35:23.411
I mean, do you know
how much time I have wasted

35:23.581 --> 35:25.093
on Tim Riggins?

35:25.286 --> 35:27.165
But I have to focus on me.

35:27.335 --> 35:30.835
- I'm going to Vanderbilt next year...
- Shut up! You got in?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.170
No...

35:32.340 --> 35:33.376
but I will.

35:34.456 --> 35:36.716
OK. Well,
I don't know where that is,

35:36.886 --> 35:39.469
but it sounds fancy pants
and I have a little present for you.

35:39.639 --> 35:42.013
- You know that I really like this song?
- This is...

35:42.183 --> 35:44.182
mom's favorite
man-hater breakup music.

35:44.352 --> 35:45.683
It makes me wanna dance.

35:45.974 --> 35:47.894
Yeah, it gets a lot of playing time
around here.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.646
- To man hating. Ready?
- OK.

35:53.798 --> 35:55.007
I love this!

35:55.177 --> 35:56.592
It's so good.

35:59.817 --> 36:02.167
You know this, right here,
what this is?

36:02.364 --> 36:03.951
An anti-Riggins force field.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.038
There ain't no...

36:06.168 --> 36:08.998
- Billy in my chili, yo.
- No Billy in your chili.

36:09.949 --> 36:12.995
- What was that move you were doing?
- Thought I'd, like...

36:14.773 --> 36:15.773
Mindy!

36:18.403 --> 36:19.953
Oh, God!
Now, shake it!

36:20.980 --> 36:23.030
Shake it up!
Shake it! Shake it!

36:27.709 --> 36:29.504
What is that?
What are you doing?

36:29.772 --> 36:30.791
No, no!

36:31.046 --> 36:32.939
- Mindy, come on, open up.
- I gotta go pee.

36:33.241 --> 36:35.900
- I can totally see you.
- Go away, Billy! Nobody likes you!

36:36.209 --> 36:37.512
Come on, open up!

36:37.637 --> 36:40.571
- It's a Riggins brother.
- Come on, baby. I'm sorry.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.698
You can go back to your job,
I don't care.

36:44.552 --> 36:47.077
I just want you back.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.087
I love you.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.624
Give me one more chance, please.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.259
I love you.

36:54.227 --> 36:55.127
No, no!

36:55.920 --> 36:57.220
Mindy, no!

36:58.887 --> 37:00.967
- Oh, Mindy.
- Shut up, shut up!

37:02.691 --> 37:05.532
- Don't ever leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.423
- What's that tape?
- Love that music,

37:09.548 --> 37:11.894
- you still don't like it.
- No, that music is awful, honey.

37:12.385 --> 37:14.405
... I said the Hilton,
I didn't say the Woodson.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.390
- Wait, slow down.
- Why? I got the money.

37:18.515 --> 37:20.185
- I don't care.
- I'll pay 'em back.

37:20.310 --> 37:22.420
I don't care.
You left me with all those men.

37:22.545 --> 37:24.740
- I said I was coming back!
- I don't care!

37:25.627 --> 37:27.801
Damn it! Tyra!
We're talking about this!

37:28.398 --> 37:30.079
You're not leaving.
Damn it, Tyra!

37:30.204 --> 37:31.885
Tyra, sit down!

37:32.201 --> 37:34.964
- Help me, please!
- No, I'm not letting you leave.

37:36.392 --> 37:37.295
Easy.

37:37.932 --> 37:39.964
- Damn it, Tyra!
- Get in the car, get in.

37:40.536 --> 37:42.466
Tyra, please!
Baby, I'm sorry.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.886
- Calm down a second.
- I'm not calming down.

37:45.315 --> 37:46.846
Tyra, please, come on!

37:47.016 --> 37:48.598
- Get in the car.
- Let me explain.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.184
I'm sorry.
Come on, babe.

37:52.141 --> 37:54.362
- Damn it, Tyra. I'm sorry.
- All right? Easy now.

37:54.615 --> 37:55.615
Damn it!

37:59.057 --> 38:00.067
Tyra, come on.

38:00.791 --> 38:02.199
Son of a bitch!

38:35.031 --> 38:36.308
You all right?

38:38.092 --> 38:39.125
Yes, ma'am.

38:43.077 --> 38:44.077
Really?

38:52.600 --> 38:53.614
Thank you.

39:04.312 --> 39:07.593
7 = 5x + 4...

39:11.490 --> 39:13.543
- What are you doing?
- Calculus.

39:14.998 --> 39:16.397
I got you something.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.565
I did a little research
and found out that most of the colleges

39:21.735 --> 39:25.278
have January 15th
as the deadline for fall admission.

39:26.033 --> 39:29.095
Yeah, I think... I think Mr. Shea
said something about that.

39:29.220 --> 39:31.409
You can fill out
your application online

39:31.579 --> 39:34.662
and that still gives you a whole month
to get transcripts, write the essay...

39:35.253 --> 39:36.622
You can still do it, Matt.

39:37.076 --> 39:39.517
Yeah, but what am I gonna do
about grandma?

39:41.378 --> 39:43.340
I'm sure we could work
something out.

39:44.569 --> 39:46.424
OK, but then, how am I supposed
to pay for it?

39:48.214 --> 39:49.782
We could rob a bank.

39:50.434 --> 39:52.680
I drive the getaway car, you go in,
grandma covers the door.

39:55.179 --> 39:56.597
There's an image!

39:56.722 --> 39:58.769
I don't know,
we'll figure out the money thing, too.

39:59.361 --> 40:01.925
There's still scholarships
for children of the military.

40:02.050 --> 40:03.295
That's an option.

40:03.831 --> 40:06.777
It's gotta be good
to get the ball rolling, you know.

40:08.537 --> 40:10.387
Yeah, you're probably right.

40:11.291 --> 40:12.783
There was one of them that had...

40:13.234 --> 40:15.571
this really great
Fine Art Department.

40:16.276 --> 40:18.080
This one, in San Francisco.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.835
Come on, catch the football.

40:23.554 --> 40:24.643
There you go.

40:26.175 --> 40:27.215
It's alive!

40:27.525 --> 40:30.300
I thought I was gonna have
to send in Search and Rescue.

40:30.425 --> 40:32.303
- Dad, you don't have to yell...
- It's already

40:32.473 --> 40:35.702
beer thirty in here. What are you
doing, with sleeping so late?

40:37.904 --> 40:40.571
Let's see.
It's not your mother,

40:40.740 --> 40:43.233
I don't have any friends...
Who could that be?

40:43.358 --> 40:44.403
I got it.

40:45.267 --> 40:46.484
I'll bet I know.

40:55.665 --> 40:56.827
What are you doing?

40:57.282 --> 40:59.478
- What do you want?
- Wanna come outside and play with me?

40:59.603 --> 41:02.145
- Why don't you wanna play?
- Tim, I'm not in the mood for this.

41:02.270 --> 41:03.545
OK, I got in.

41:04.315 --> 41:06.428
- You got in what?
- I'm in. College, in.

41:06.553 --> 41:07.925
I'm in college.

41:08.676 --> 41:10.226
I'm going to college.

41:12.535 --> 41:15.403
I met with the recruiter, I sat down,
we filled out some paperwork,

41:15.528 --> 41:18.808
he said I'm in. There's more paperwork
to be done, but apparently,

41:18.978 --> 41:22.254
even some half-scholarship,
or even more, I don't even know yet.

41:22.379 --> 41:23.628
But I'm in.

41:25.448 --> 41:26.607
Still nothing.

41:26.777 --> 41:30.027
Do you need me to say you were right
and I was wrong? Cause you were right.

41:33.124 --> 41:36.158
It's not working yet, is it?
Let me cover my bases here.

41:36.786 --> 41:37.786
One,

41:38.241 --> 41:39.241
I'm sorry.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.539
Two, I mean it,
I'm really sorry.

41:42.251 --> 41:45.636
Three, thank you.
Four, I wanna go celebrate.

41:46.158 --> 41:48.838
I only want to celebrate with you,
'cause I wouldn't be here without you.

41:49.655 --> 41:52.758
Five, say yes. At this point,
come on. I'll keep going.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.691
- Did you really get in?
- Yes.

41:54.816 --> 41:57.263
Only Riggins to get in, yet.
Probably the last.

41:57.388 --> 41:58.719
I knew you would.

41:59.426 --> 42:00.433
I told you.

42:02.089 --> 42:03.112
Kinda crazy.

42:04.097 --> 42:05.187
That's great.

42:05.769 --> 42:07.168
Hey, because of you.

42:08.197 --> 42:09.483
I'm in because of you.

42:09.809 --> 42:11.259
So, yeah, you can...

42:13.115 --> 42:14.530
Are you on a bender right now?

42:15.020 --> 42:17.848
I almost got a buzz
off your breath, there.

42:17.973 --> 42:20.244
That's, like, I don't think
it's safe for me to drive strong

42:20.414 --> 42:24.081
right now, and for me to say that,
that's a lot, you know.

42:24.251 --> 42:26.863
- Sorry.
- Don't be, it's fantastic.

42:30.713 --> 42:34.163
Let me get drunk then.
I'll come with you, I'm on board.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.208
I'm on board.

43:20.921 --> 43:24.211
I found Matt and Julie
in bed together this afternoon.

43:28.847 --> 43:29.897
You're, like,

43:30.067 --> 43:32.441
this young, wholesome,
milk-drinking quarterback.

43:33.575 --> 43:34.575
There we go.

43:34.821 --> 43:37.280
I took the savings money
and made a risky investment,

43:37.449 --> 43:39.281
- and I lost the money.
- So I'll get a job

43:39.451 --> 43:41.951
and I'll help out
until I go to college.

43:42.678 --> 43:44.286
Lyla, I used the college money.
