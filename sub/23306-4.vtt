Mike.

<i>- Doesn't really scream out</i>
<i>multiple different styles.</i>

30:31.204 --> 30:32.539
<i>Look how far the hairline</i>
<i>is from the brow.</i>

30:32.622 --> 30:35.041
<i>It's a tall head.</i>

30:35.124 --> 30:36.918
It's beautifully done, but
the design element gets away.

30:38.836 --> 30:41.589
- Amanda.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.509
I definitely do see the two
styles that are in this tattoo.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.094
<i>Your shining moments</i>
<i>for me are the bees.</i>

30:46.177 --> 30:49.305
<i>- You get a little bit</i>
<i>risky putting that bee</i>

30:49.389 --> 30:51.391
<i>in the center in</i>
<i>the black-on-black,</i>

30:51.474 --> 30:52.934
<i>where it just gets lost.</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:55.311
Thinking for ingenuity you've
got to think of a way to make

30:55.395 --> 30:58.398
this design come together
where everything is legible.

30:58.481 --> 31:01.818
These are decisions
that you made.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.820
- Jason.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.281
- I think
the cat got away from you.

31:06.364 --> 31:10.368
The inferred fur patterns
give it more of a cover-up feel

31:10.451 --> 31:12.787
than a soft, flowing fur feel.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.330
- I was just afraid
of going too light with it.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.541
<i>- Between the black areas</i>
<i>that have a washy feel to 'em</i>

31:16.624 --> 31:20.128
<i>and then the very light tones</i>
<i>in the center of the flowers,</i>

31:20.211 --> 31:21.671
it gives the tattoo not such a

31:21.754 --> 31:24.048
strong, vibrant effect
against such pale skin.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.844

31:29.554 --> 31:31.055
- I love it.

<i>The outline on</i>
<i>this thing is perfect.</i>

31:36.978 --> 31:38.187
I think it's tough, man.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.647

different distinct styles.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.901
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>realism in this tattoo.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:45.278
<i>I do like the flowers.</i>

31:45.361 --> 31:46.529
<i>I just don't think that you</i>

31:46.613 --> 31:49.407
really nailed that part
of the challenge.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.327
- Daniel.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.204
- I think ingenuity here
was at the drawing table.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.291
<i>You figured out a way to show</i>
<i>geometric dots,</i>

31:58.374 --> 31:59.500
<i>bold line work,</i>

31:59.584 --> 32:02.337
<i>solid color saturation,</i>
<i>and shading.</i>

32:02.420 --> 32:05.673
- But was it a mistake to
color green in the bottom fin

32:05.757 --> 32:07.300
inside the area
where it's dot work?

32:07.383 --> 32:08.593
<i>- It did not look cool</i>

32:08.676 --> 32:11.095
with just little pieces,
so I did it on purpose.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.930

looks like a mistake.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.182
<i>- I'm with</i>
<i>Ollie on this one.</i>

32:14.265 --> 32:15.224

32:15.308 --> 32:17.352
"Oops. Oh, [bleep]."

32:17.435 --> 32:18.645
That's just a bad choice.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.190

<i>He said that's</i>
<i>the way he does it.</i>

34:19.181 --> 34:20.600
But obviously, you
can't argue with the result.

34:20.683 --> 34:21.934
- You could argue
with that hair, though.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.270
<i>That hair is</i>
<i>arguing with itself.</i>

34:24.353 --> 34:25.730
D had a crazy, shaky canvas,

34:25.813 --> 34:28.649
<i>and he pulled off cleaner</i>
<i>lines than spaghetti hair.</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:30.818
- If she didn't move, Lil' D
would still be at the bottom.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.029
<i>It's not designed well.</i>

34:33.112 --> 34:34.989
<i>The whole face alone is bad.</i>

34:35.072 --> 34:37.784

this one to Matt's.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.161
<i>The haze around the majority</i>

34:40.244 --> 34:42.413
<i>of the tattoo is a big</i>
<i>sign he had a rough time.</i>

34:42.496 --> 34:46.626
That's where the inexperience
comes into play, and it showed.

34:46.708 --> 34:47.752
- Did my team put this out?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.420
- I'm not saying
it's not a bad tattoo.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.670
- If he was not on your
team, and he was on mine...

34:50.755 --> 34:51.880
both: Gone.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.507
- That's
all I needed to know.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.177
- What?

34:56.260 --> 34:59.388
- Today we're
testing ingenuity, taking

34:59.472 --> 35:01.974
two opposing styles
and mashing them together.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.518
Who would you
say is on the bottom?

35:03.601 --> 35:06.521
- Lil' D had one of the
toughest outings today, and he

35:06.604 --> 35:07.688
<i>was struggling in the room,</i>

35:07.772 --> 35:08.523
<i>and he struggled</i>
<i>with his canvas,</i>

35:08.606 --> 35:09.857
<i>struggling with this idea.</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:12.860
- Not only do I not see
two styles mashed together...

35:12.944 --> 35:14.111
- There's no cohesion.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.404
- Nothing works
together about this.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.864
- It's really rough.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.866
- Shockingly enough, I
think this is probably tattooed

35:18.950 --> 35:20.326
better than Matt's tattoo.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.453
- If you just zoom
in closely to any one of these

35:22.537 --> 35:24.914
<i>three roses, technically</i>
<i>they are not well done.</i>

35:24.997 --> 35:25.915

35:25.998 --> 35:27.208
<i>There's shading problems.</i>

35:27.291 --> 35:29.418
<i>There's color</i>
<i>saturation problems.</i>

35:29.502 --> 35:31.254
Lack of experience plays
a big role in this tattoo.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.298
- I had a lot of problems
with Katie's tattoo.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.591
<i>When you look at the flower,</i>

35:35.675 --> 35:37.677
<i>that thing is</i>
<i>so poorly saturated.</i>

35:37.760 --> 35:40.304
<i>- It looks like she did the</i>
<i>flower, then did the skulls,</i>

35:40.388 --> 35:42.223
<i>and then wiped all</i>
<i>the black all over the red,</i>

35:42.306 --> 35:43.307
<i>just smeared it</i>
<i>and muddied it.</i>

35:43.391 --> 35:46.811
{\an3}It should look
like it was done today.
