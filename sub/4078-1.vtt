01:35.000 --> 01:36.672
You want a ride?

01:52.520 --> 01:55.637
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.798
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Mr Charles Eastman.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.117
So would l. I expect to
if I work another five years!

02:16.320 --> 02:20.279
- How do I get to his office?
- Go to the administration building.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.273
Just a moment.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.752
- Mr Eastman?
- Yes.

02:49.960 --> 02:54.397
I'm sorry. our Mr Eastman is
at home today. He won't be in.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.033
He won't?

02:56.240 --> 02:58.993
- Are you a relative?
- He's my uncle.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.352
I'm sure he'll want to see you.
Let me give him a ring.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.956
Yes, one moment, please.

03:09.240 --> 03:15.110
Paris can dictate to women what to
wear at a cocktail party or to bed.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.279
Paris is not going to tell American
women what bathing suits to wear!

03:19.480 --> 03:21.675
- Miss ottinger.
- Hello.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.193
Who?

03:26.320 --> 03:30.950
Yes, of course. All right, let me
have a word with the young man.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.311
- Thank you.
- It's on number two.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.309
- Hello.
- Hello, my boy.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.354
- I hope you remember, sir.
- of course. How are you?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.630
You certainly got here fast.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.435
I wanted to. But I didn't want
to bother you at home.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.030
Drop by to the house
at about seven o'clock.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.471
Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.077
My tie on crooked?

04:27.280 --> 04:34.038
No, it's just that I was thinking...
George Eastman's dropping in tonight.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.360
George Eastman...?
You mean Asa's son?

04:39.560 --> 04:44.554
- Right. I ran into him in Chicago.
- Will he lead us in a prayer?

04:44.760 --> 04:48.912
He's not at all like Asa or his wife.
He's very quiet and pleasant.

04:49.120 --> 04:54.797
Not much education, but ambitious.
And he looks amazingly like Earl.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.195
- What's he do?
- Hotel bellhop.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.595
I always wanted
to look like a bellhop!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.950
Why bring him on here?

05:02.160 --> 05:04.355
There's always a place at the plant.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.872
- What do we do about him socially?
- Easy. Leave town.

05:09.080 --> 05:13.790
You don't have to take him up
socially. He just wants to work.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.632
- A man by the name of Eastman.
- Show him in, William.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.595
Charles, sometimes I think
you're in your second childhood.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.958
- Good evening, sir.
- Hi, George.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.358
This is my wife.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.109
My daughter, Marcia.
My son, Earl. George Eastman.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.796
Sit down, George.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.039
- Like a cocktail, a drink?
- No, thank you.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.836
My husband says he met you
in Chicago at a hotel.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.874
- That's right.
- You must have left very suddenly.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.436
Well, you see, I quit my job.

06:07.480 --> 06:12.429
Mr Eastman was good enough to say
that if I came through here,

06:12.640 --> 06:15.518
he might find some place for me.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.632
I think we can work something out.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.628
- What do you think, Earl?
- Done any bookkeeping?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.195
- Typewriting? Stenography?
- No.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.834
You see Earl in the morning.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.555
Thank you, sir.
That's very kind of you.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.833
And your mother? I trust she's well.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.952
We've never met,
but I've heard her mentioned.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.233
She wrote Charles a moving letter
at the time of your father's death.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.398
Is she still active
in her religious work?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.558
- Yes, ma'am, she is.
- Church work?

06:56.760 --> 07:02.630
Not exactly. It's more like
social work. It's a mission.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.796
Like the Salvation Army?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.959
No, it's not like the Salvation Army.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.072
- It's more...
- More intimate, maybe?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.794
Did I hear you say intimate, darling?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.275
- You're late.
- I'm always late.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.950
It's part of my charm. Good evening,
Mr Eastman, Mrs Eastman.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.752
You know Tom Tipton.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.235
Don't drink. We haven't got time.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.115
- Thanks.
- Well, I'm ready.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.356
Men are so disgustingly prompt!

07:32.560 --> 07:35.711
They do it to put us women
in a bad light.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.990
I hear your place is
coming along fine.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.716
- It's a dream palace.
- Will it be ready for summer?

07:42.920 --> 07:47.471
- Even if I have to whip everyone!
- All right, Simone Legree. Let's go.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.956
- Goodnight, Eastman.
- Good night.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.713
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.955
Have you anywhere to stay?

07:59.160 --> 08:01.674
I can recommend a quiet
rooming house.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.555
- My secretary used to stay there.
- Thanks. I found a place.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.354
That was fortunate, wasn't it?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.950
Sorry we're not home for dinner.
Another time perhaps.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.470
Yes. You see Earl in the morning.
Good night.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.468
- Good night, sir. Good night.
- Good night.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.273
Charles Eastman!

08:23.480 --> 08:26.836
Be aware every minute
that you're an Eastman.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.716
- You must act accordingly.
- I understand that.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.114
Another thing.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.552
As you noticed, nine out of ten
Eastman employees are women.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.753
There's a company rule against
mixing with the girls here.

08:45.960 --> 08:51.796
My father asked me to call this
to your attention. That is a must.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.673
This is George Eastman.
Take George to Mr Whiting, please.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.398
Mrs Kovak, this is George Eastman.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.795
- He's here for a while.
- oK.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.274
This is it.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.751
Now you're in business.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.592
- Hello, Angela.
- Hi, Angela.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.471
Look, this room could be your study.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.116
There's even an old cupboard
for your books.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.869
Whatever else is in it,
it isn't books!

11:52.000 --> 11:55.356
- Who lived here?
- A pirate in search of his soul.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.994
Think he found it?

11:58.200 --> 11:59.792
- Vicky...
- What?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.958
Could we be happy here,
never seeing anyone again?

12:03.160 --> 12:07.358
- Small world.
- That's what you think.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.518
Put your arms around me.
Imagine the sea at night.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.678
Who's your friend?

12:13.880 --> 12:16.758
Hold me, Ray.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.274
When I feel you close,
all our lies come true.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.870
Nothing can ever spoil them again.

12:43.400 --> 12:51.114
If the girls saw me, they'd say
I was making up to the boss's nephew.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.995
That's silly.
I'm in the same boat as you.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.873
An Eastman isn't in the same boat
with anyone.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.117
- I work along with you, don't l?
- Sure.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.598
They'll move you to a better job,
and you'll be in the front office.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.758
That's the last we'll see
of Mr George Eastman.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.234
Who says that?

13:10.440 --> 13:13.671
We know they put you
in with us to learn the business.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.599
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.633
...Lord's divine command,

13:19.840 --> 13:24.755
when you find a brother struggling,

13:24.960 --> 13:30.717
Iend a willing, helping hand.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.879
Bear ye one another's burdens...

13:46.000 --> 13:49.788
- You lonely all the time?
- Not on week days.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.276
How come?

13:53.520 --> 13:57.274
Remember I put swimsuits
in boxes six days a week?

13:57.480 --> 14:01.917
Yeah. What about Sundays? Maybe
then you put yourself in a swimsuit.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.513
Not me.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.708
Why? You don't look good
in a swimsuit?

14:09.920 --> 14:15.438
- Sure I do. I can't swim.
- You're kidding!

14:16.520 --> 14:18.476
I never learned.

14:19.520 --> 14:24.469
I was even scared of the duck pond
when I was a kid.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.594
We lived on a farm, a small one.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.956
How come you came here?

14:36.520 --> 14:39.478
We were poor. We needed the money.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.318
I came down here and got a job.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.832
- I'm glad.
- Me, too.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.956
This is it, where I live.

14:58.960 --> 15:04.318
- It's 4433½ Elm Avenue.
- I'll walk you to the door.

15:05.520 --> 15:09.559
I can manage from here.
I have my own private entrance.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.273
Good night.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.956
My landlady is fierce.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.640
I've wanted to do that for so long.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.354
I did, too.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.193
Will we see each other again
like this?

15:35.400 --> 15:38.312
- If you want.
- When?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.159
It's up to you. You gotta be careful.

15:41.360 --> 15:46.229
We can meet like tonight.
Tonight has been wonderful!

16:11.080 --> 16:13.036
I'd better go in now.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.753
Don't go.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.072
Please don't go.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.953
Good night.

16:44.320 --> 16:48.074
- I was looking over at you today.
- I was looking over at you.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.555
Not as much as usual.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.788
- I was thinking about my plan.
- Don't we work fast enough as it is?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.275
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hello, Angela.

17:08.839 --> 17:12.594
George, I'm glad you're still
in the packaging room.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.519
Not just for my sake, honest.

17:15.720 --> 17:20.031
It's better for you than running
around with those Eastmans

17:20.240 --> 17:23.277
and all those rich girls
with nothing to do.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.632
I've only been out to the house
once since I got here.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.593
I used to think you went every night.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.870
Don't be silly, honey.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.468
George, remember when I said

17:36.680 --> 17:41.629
if you're an Eastman, you're not
in the same boat with anybody?

17:41.840 --> 17:43.273
Yeah.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.352
I take it back.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.196
Let's find a quieter place.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.116
You don't know any other place
we can go, do you?

18:09.320 --> 18:13.757
There's a soda fountain
where all the high school kids go.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.632
They're noisy.

18:17.320 --> 18:20.278
I don't care as long as I'm with you.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.479
- What are you doing here?
- Talking.

18:46.520 --> 18:50.479
They've invented the house.
It's a very good place to talk in.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.070
You'd better get back to yours.
Come on.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.714
Come on.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.272
- Good night.
- Come on.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.437
I wish I could ask you in,
but Mrs Roberts is so strict.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.598
I don't want to make things
difficult for you.

19:58.080 --> 20:03.154
I wish I could ask you in, but we'd
have to keep the music awful low.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.797
This is nice.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.753
Mrs Roberts is right next door.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.433
This is the way it should have been.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.957
This is the way...

21:14.520 --> 21:16.192
oh, George.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.879
George.

21:50.520 --> 21:54.069
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.116
Who's that? Is that George?

22:09.320 --> 22:11.390
- Yeah.
- What's he doing here?

22:11.600 --> 22:14.637
It was the only place to put him
without firing somebody.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.956
This is no place for him.

22:17.160 --> 22:20.596
- How's he getting along?
- Fine.

22:21.360 --> 22:26.115
It wouldn't hurt to give him
a position. Well, George.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.073
You thought I'd forgotten
all about you.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.716
- No, sir.
- I've been keeping an eye on you.

22:32.920 --> 22:38.233
- That's very good of you, sir.
- Getting along all right?

22:38.440 --> 22:42.115
- I know the work pretty well.
- I suppose you do.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.756
Do you know it well enough
to take on responsibility?

22:45.960 --> 22:49.589
- Yes, sir.
- Good. I'm going to move you up.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.236
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You've earned it.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.431
Sir, I was wondering...

22:56.520 --> 23:01.548
Have you by any chance seen
the production report I submitted?

23:02.520 --> 23:08.231
Mrs Eastman is having a party at
the house on the 1 5th of next month.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.637
- We'd like to have you drop in.
- I'd love to come.

23:11.840 --> 23:16.595
Good. Then you and I can have
a nice little talk.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.514
Next month on the 1 5th?

23:26.720 --> 23:30.633
That's your birthday.
I was planning on our little party.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.796
Sure, honey.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.276
I'll just be at the old man's
to pay my respects.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.914
- Then I'll be over.
- You better be!

24:15.840 --> 24:18.593
- Hello, darling!
- Nice to see you again.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.074
Hello, there.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.634
Later.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.674
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:52.520 --> 25:56.433
- I see you had a misspent youth.
- Yes, it was.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.118
Why all alone? Being exclusive?

26:06.320 --> 26:08.276
Being dramatic?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.479
Being blue?

26:15.520 --> 26:18.796
I'm just fooling around.
Maybe you'd like to play.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.515
No, I'll just watch you. Go ahead.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.034
Do I make you nervous?

26:35.920 --> 26:37.194
Yes.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.756
You look like an Eastman.
Are you one of them?

26:41.960 --> 26:44.315
I'm a nephew. My name's George.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.954
- I'm Angela.
- Vickers.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.357
- I saw you here last spring.
- I don't remember seeing you.

26:52.560 --> 26:58.317
No. You've been away, haven't you?
You took a trip with your parents.

26:58.520 --> 27:02.149
- How did you know?
- I read about you in the papers.

27:04.400 --> 27:08.473
- What else do you do?
- The usual things.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.194
You look unusual.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.272
That's the first time
anybody ever said that!

27:14.480 --> 27:19.429
- You keep pretty much to yourself.
- Yes, sometimes.

27:20.520 --> 27:24.069
Blue...or exclusive?

27:25.520 --> 27:28.512
- Neither, right now.
- Here you are, George!

27:28.720 --> 27:30.039
Well, Angela.

27:30.240 --> 27:34.916
- I was thinking how's your mother?
- Fine, last time I heard.

27:35.120 --> 27:40.638
Have you written to her about your
promotion? I kicked him up a notch.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.910
I'll write in a day or two.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.954
Never neglect your mother.
Telephone to her right away.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.675
Tell her the good news.
You can use this phone.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.668
Long distance? What's the number,
George? Just a minute.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.272
I don't know.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.114
Hello.

28:01.320 --> 28:06.838
I want to place a call to the Bethel
lndependent Mission in Kansas City.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.274
- The Bethel Mission.
- Hello, Mama.

28:16.480 --> 28:20.996
George! God bless you, my son.
Are you sick?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.156
No, I'm not sick.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.635
Are you're coming home?

28:25.840 --> 28:29.515
Listen, Mama. I got a promotion.

28:30.320 --> 28:35.269
Yeah, I can send you money
every month now.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.073
Happy birthday. Today's your
birthday and I've prayed for you.

28:40.280 --> 28:45.308
I've been praying you'll come home
and carry on your father's work.

28:45.520 --> 28:51.868
I'm keeping your room for you, just
as you left it, like I always do.

28:53.320 --> 28:59.031
I'm getting on pretty well here.
I'm happy here, too.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.113
- Who's there with you?
- It's me, Mama!

29:05.320 --> 29:08.630
- Who was that?
- Just a girl, Mama.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.594
No, Mama.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.471
I don't... Mama, I just met her!

29:19.080 --> 29:21.958
Yes, Mama. I will, Mama.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.232
I know you'll be a good son.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.912
I promise.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.554
- Goodbye, my son.
- Goodbye, Mama.

29:34.680 --> 29:40.789
Did you promise to be a good boy?
Not to waste your time on girls?

29:41.840 --> 29:46.470
- I don't waste my time.
- Will she let you go out tonight?

29:46.680 --> 29:49.831
Will she let you go dancing? Come on.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.874
I'll take you dancing...
on your birthday, blue boy.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.510
Gee, Al, isn't it the limit?

31:29.560 --> 31:32.279
The party just broke up
a few minutes ago.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.276
I'm sorry, honey.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.073
I couldn't get away for three hours.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.711
Four hours. You must have paid him
an awful lot of respects.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.273
He's really gonna do things for me.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.270
He said, "l got my eye on you."
I think he really means it, too.

32:00.160 --> 32:04.199
That's fine.
But you could have phoned me.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.195
- Yeah, I know, I could have phoned.
- Never mind.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.953
Your present's waiting for you
on your plate.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.435
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

32:27.520 --> 32:33.117
Hey, that's wonderful! I can sure
use that on my new job, huh?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.957
Were there many young people
there tonight?

32:39.160 --> 32:42.118
- A few. Why?
- oh, it's melted.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.758
Was your cousin Marcia there?

32:50.320 --> 32:52.788
All those pretty girls in the papers?

32:53.000 --> 32:57.073
Some of them were, yes.
They're not all pretty.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.675
- Was Angela Vickers?
- What?

33:03.160 --> 33:06.197
Pretty. Did you like her very much?

33:07.240 --> 33:10.630
I liked her some.
Sure, she's a pretty girl.

33:10.840 --> 33:15.960
- She wears nice clothes.
- Why shouldn't she, with that money?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.754
Why do you keep needling me?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.916
I can't help it.

33:23.840 --> 33:27.435
Why couldn't you tell them
you had an appointment?

33:27.640 --> 33:33.158
You know I can't tell them about you.
You understand the fix we're in.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.513
Yeah, I know.

33:36.600 --> 33:41.549
If my family ever found out about us,
we'd both be out of a job.

33:42.680 --> 33:48.437
George, maybe you don't want to see
me so much any more. Is that it?

33:51.080 --> 33:54.959
Maybe you don't want
to see me at all.

33:55.160 --> 34:00.314
- Now you're head of the department.
- You know I didn't say that.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.476
Honey, don't cry.

34:04.520 --> 34:09.958
Look, you dance just as pretty
as anybody. You look just as pretty.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.833
Stop crying, will you?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.958
George, it's awful.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.038
I can't tell you.

34:20.239 --> 34:23.676
- What is it?
- I'm so afraid.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.114
Honey, what's the matter?

34:29.520 --> 34:33.228
George...we're in trouble.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.989
Real trouble, I think.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.875
How do you mean?

34:43.920 --> 34:49.472
Remember the first night
you came here?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.275
I'm so worried.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.358
Hello, Al. It's me. How do you feel?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.834
Just the same, huh?

36:16.240 --> 36:20.199
No, I haven't found the name
of any doctor yet.

36:25.520 --> 36:30.469
Yes, don't you worry. Everything's
gonna turn out all right.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.274
Yeah.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.676
Yeah, first thing.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.794
Good night.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.794
Hello?

37:04.320 --> 37:05.673
Speaking.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.954
Who?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.192
oh, hello!

37:13.760 --> 37:19.517
Yes, of course I remember you. I just
didn't recognise your voice at first.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.391
Friday night? Yeah.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.356
I think I can.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.957
No, I'd like to. Yes.

37:34.680 --> 37:35.954
Where?

37:37.520 --> 37:40.193
All right. I'll meet you there.

37:42.080 --> 37:45.516
Yeah. Goodbye, Miss Vickers.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.874
Huh?

37:52.320 --> 37:54.151
Goodbye, Angela.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.560
- A penny.
- For what?

38:26.760 --> 38:29.991
For your thoughts.
Highest prices paid.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.876
I was wondering
why you invited me tonight.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.958
Because of my reasons.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.753
Good evening, Miss Vickers.
Good evening, Mr Eastman.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.353
Good evening.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.319
- Angela, darling, hello.
- Hello, Marcia.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.671
- Hello, George. Having fun?
- I just got here.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.871
Come on in and join the party.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.311
It's going to be
such a wonderful summer.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.876
- Do you ride?
- I'm just taking it up.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.595
Hello, Mother, Dad.
We keep several horses.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.873
There'll be lots of parties
and dances and things like that.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.355
And who, may I ask, is he?

39:23.560 --> 39:28.759
If she weren't my daughter,
I'd ask her the same question.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.836
Aren't you happy with me?

39:46.040 --> 39:49.476
Happy? The trouble is
I'm too happy tonight.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.471
You seem so strange,
so deep and far away.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.518
As though you were
holding something back.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.870
- I am.
- Don't.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.435
I'd better.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.956
This is nice.
I don't want to spoil it.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.435
You'd better tell me.

40:23.400 --> 40:29.191
I love you. I've loved you
since the first moment I saw you.

40:29.400 --> 40:33.359
I guess maybe I even loved you
before I saw you.

40:35.520 --> 40:40.116
And you're the fellow that wondered
why I invited you here tonight.

40:40.320 --> 40:45.633
I tell you why. I love...
Are they watching us?

40:49.520 --> 40:53.149
I love you, too! It scares me.

40:55.960 --> 40:59.555
- But it is a wonderful feeling.
- It's wonderful when you're here.

40:59.760 --> 41:04.117
I can hold you, I can see you.
I can hold you next to me.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.630
But what's it going to be like
next week?

41:07.840 --> 41:11.435
I'll still be as much in love
with you. You'll be gone!

41:11.640 --> 41:15.189
But I'll be at the lake!
You'll come and see me.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.755
It's so beautiful. You must come.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.076
I know my parents will be a problem.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.875
But you can come the weekends
when the kids are there.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.755
You don't have to work weekends.
That's the best time.

41:27.960 --> 41:32.033
If you don't come,
I'll drive down here to see you.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.754
I'll pick you up outside the factory.

41:37.680 --> 41:44.392
You'll be my pick-up! We'll arrange
it somehow, whatever way we can.

41:44.600 --> 41:49.310
We'll have such wonderful times
together, just the two of us.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.956
- I'd be the happiest person alive.
- The second happiest.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.119
Angela, if I could only tell you
how much I love you.

41:57.320 --> 42:02.474
- If I could only tell you all.
- Tell Mama.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.316
Tell Mama all.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.438
- Your age, Mrs Hamilton?
- Twenty-two.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.715
How long married?

42:55.760 --> 42:57.557
Three months.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.635
Well, now... Sit down.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.869
What seems to be the trouble,
Mrs Hamilton?

43:14.240 --> 43:16.356
You needn't be afraid to tell me.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.519
That's my business,
listening to other people's troubles.

43:26.680 --> 43:29.319
It's like this.

43:31.760 --> 43:35.196
My husband hasn't much money.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.188
I have to work
to help pay the expenses.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.279
Yes?

43:53.240 --> 43:58.268
When I found out I was going
to have a baby...

43:59.120 --> 44:01.395
...we didn't see...

44:06.240 --> 44:09.357
We didn't know any doctors.

44:09.560 --> 44:12.199
What business is your husband in?

44:14.600 --> 44:16.033
Electrician.

44:16.240 --> 44:20.518
That's not such a bad business.
At least they charge enough!

44:24.320 --> 44:28.598
- We can't afford to...
- There are free hospitals, you know?

44:32.600 --> 44:34.272
I know.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.152
Free hospitals
don't solve everything.

44:42.360 --> 44:47.354
Tell me, how did you happen
to come to me, anyhow?

44:50.240 --> 44:53.630
I heard people say
you were a good doctor.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.398
I see.

44:56.680 --> 45:01.117
Mrs Hamilton, when you went
to the altar three months ago,

45:01.320 --> 45:06.952
you must have realised you might
have to face a situation like this.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.709
once you make up your mind
to face this bravely,

45:10.920 --> 45:16.313
you'll find all the problems
have a way of sorting themselves out.

45:16.520 --> 45:21.878
Medical bills, clothes. I know.

45:24.520 --> 45:28.069
I know my wife and l
worried at first.

45:30.400 --> 45:34.154
- But now we can look back...
- It's not like that!

45:35.840 --> 45:37.796
I'm not married.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.833
I haven't got a husband.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.675
All right, that won't do any good.

46:07.320 --> 46:12.599
- Where's the young man?
- He deserted me. What'll I do?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.594
Somebody's gotta help me.

46:16.800 --> 46:22.750
Miss Hamilton, my advice is go home
and see your parents and tell them.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.069
It'll be much better that way,
I assure you.

46:28.680 --> 46:32.639
If you've come to place yourself
under my care during your pregnancy,

46:32.840 --> 46:37.470
I'll do everything to ensure
your health and that of your child.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.274
on the other hand,
if you've just come for free advice

46:42.480 --> 46:46.359
on material and financial problems...

46:48.800 --> 46:51.633
...with which I can't help you...

46:52.760 --> 46:55.513
No, I cannot help you.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.231
What did he say?

47:14.440 --> 47:19.309
He said he thought I ought
to make a very healthy mother.

47:19.520 --> 47:20.794
Gee, Al.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.434
That's all you've said for weeks.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.676
I'm trying to think.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.276
You just gotta marry me.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.916
Family or no family.
This future of yours or no future.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.948
Just looking at it that way
settles everything.

47:38.160 --> 47:42.597
But we haven't got any money.
This thing comes out, I'm through.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.870
I won't even have the job I got now.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.789
- You're just stalling.
- I'm not! I'm trying to think.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.956
I want to figure out some way.

47:55.680 --> 48:00.959
I was thinking maybe when I get
my vacation, first week of September.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.435
All right, that's when we'll do it.

48:03.640 --> 48:08.316
When you get your vacation,
we'll go out of town and get married.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.911
- You understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.675
Now back again to the news.

48:34.880 --> 48:39.715
It seems the fine weather has been
too fine in parts of the country.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.435
In New York City, seven persons
are reported as having succumbed

48:43.640 --> 48:45.676
from the high temperature.

48:45.880 --> 48:49.509
Nearer home, fine weather
had its darker aspects, too.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.838
The State Highway Patrol says that
fatalities from weekend accidents

48:54.040 --> 48:57.999
exceeded by four the figure for the
corresponding weekend last summer.

48:58.200 --> 49:03.320
Some 1 4 persons lost their lives.
At least five were drowned.

49:03.520 --> 49:07.479
Several others received emergency
first aid at crowded lake resorts.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.113
So be careful.

49:09.320 --> 49:13.518
It may be your turn next or
the turn of those dearest to you.

49:13.720 --> 49:19.477
Drive carefully, and don't swim
from unpatrolled beaches.

49:19.680 --> 49:23.355
Make your holiday
death's holiday, too.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.473
George!

50:06.640 --> 50:07.993
Hello, you.

50:15.320 --> 50:20.952
- I've missed you so!
- Me, too. I can't tell you how much.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.352
I've wonderful news.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.949
I had to drive down to tell you.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.109
Mother and Dad want you to spend
your vacation with us up at the lake.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.389
- You'll come, won't you?
- I don't think I can.

50:36.600 --> 50:42.869
George, no! This is my one chance
to show you off to Mother and Dad.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.469
Take my word for it, I've got to!

50:45.680 --> 50:49.116
I promised my uncle
I'd spend some time with him.

50:49.320 --> 50:55.634
That's perfect! Your aunt and uncle
are both coming up on 3rd September.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.149
That's when you're coming.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.469
Darling, I love you so much,
so very much.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.036
Just think of it.

51:09.240 --> 51:12.516
We'll go swimming together,
lie in the sun together,

51:13.600 --> 51:16.717
go horseback riding
through the pine woods.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.879
I'll make breakfast for you every
morning, and you can sleep late.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.038
I'll bring it in to you in your room.

51:28.080 --> 51:32.710
- And you love me.
- Yes.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.199
- Hello?
- I've gotta ask you a favour.

51:53.400 --> 51:58.315
Don't get angry at me.
I've gotta ask you for an extra week.

51:58.520 --> 52:03.310
- I don't have to give you anything.
- You just got to!

52:03.520 --> 52:08.310
I talked to my uncle and
he wants me to come up to the lake

52:08.520 --> 52:12.308
and spend the first week
of my vacation with them.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.795
- It's important to both of us.
- Why?

52:15.000 --> 52:19.312
I figure from the way he's been
talking that if I go up there

52:19.520 --> 52:21.636
he's gonna give me a bonus.

52:21.840 --> 52:25.799
It might be a lot of money,
I don't know, $300.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.956
We could sure use that.

52:28.160 --> 52:32.551
All right, you go up there
for a week. I'll wait here.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.753
I want to talk to you about that.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.349
I'm not sure I approve
of young Mr Eastman.

52:49.560 --> 52:54.554
- I don't know what he's doing here.
- He's here because I invited him.

52:54.760 --> 52:57.115
Why do you encourage this?

52:57.320 --> 52:59.788
You can be very unperceptive
at times.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.356
opposition only makes a boy
of that type more attractive.

53:03.560 --> 53:06.677
I invited him,
because I wanted to see him

53:06.880 --> 53:09.838
among people Angela really knows.

53:10.400 --> 53:13.358
She'll see whether he belongs or not.

53:50.320 --> 53:54.632
Come on! It's freezing!
It's just like ice!

53:57.880 --> 53:59.438
Hurry up!

54:01.520 --> 54:04.512
I've never been so cold in my life!

54:04.720 --> 54:07.188
- Aren't you going in?
- Sure.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.988
George, put me down!

54:24.840 --> 54:28.355
- It happens every single time!
- What does?

54:28.560 --> 54:31.472
I freeze to death.
It's the coldest lake ever!

54:31.680 --> 54:36.310
- What did you go in for, then?
- 'Cause it's my lake.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.750
- Yours?
- Uh-huh.

54:38.960 --> 54:41.190
I found this trail when I was 1 4.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.949
Nobody lives here,
not on this part of it.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.709
It's in two parts
with a little channel in between.

54:48.920 --> 54:54.278
There's a crumbly old lodge down at
the end and some crumbly old boats.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.513
Come closer.

55:00.160 --> 55:04.312
- What do they call this lake?
- Loon Lake. It's nice now.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.956
But sometimes it's weird,
especially at sundown.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.356
I've never been able to feel
the same about it since the drowning.

55:12.560 --> 55:16.792
- What drowning?
- A man and a girl last summer.

55:17.000 --> 55:24.509
Nobody knows what happened. It was
five days before they found the girl.

55:24.720 --> 55:28.918
- And the man?
- They never found him.

55:37.760 --> 55:40.718
- What was that?
- A loon.

55:45.720 --> 55:51.078
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.636
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:56.920 --> 56:01.311
And I used to think
I was complicated!

56:01.520 --> 56:05.798
- Are you worried about my family?
- I suppose I am.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.949
Don't. I've known them intimately
for years, and they're quite nice.

56:12.240 --> 56:17.189
Perhaps they are a little unused
to you, but that'll come in time.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.356
Suppose it doesn't?

56:21.840 --> 56:28.075
- I'd go anywhere with you.
- You mean that? You'd marry me?

56:28.280 --> 56:31.875
Haven't I told you? I intend to.

57:44.520 --> 57:47.956
...I've had a millstone named
Eastman round my neck.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.799
I know just how you feel.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.073
- What's golf got that a hike hasn't?
- A spirit of competition.

57:55.280 --> 57:58.636
I've hardly exchanged five words
with your elusive nephew.

57:58.840 --> 58:03.709
Pity, I'm told he's charming. I've
put him here so he won't run away.

58:03.920 --> 58:07.356
I'm proud of the way
you've been getting on.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.552
I've wanted to justify
your confidence in me.

58:10.760 --> 58:15.197
A man who can meet people:
that's an asset we can use.

58:15.400 --> 58:19.598
I've been thinking about a place
in administration perhaps,

58:19.800 --> 58:22.439
where I can keep an eye on you.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.598
We ought to take George
with us tomorrow.

58:25.800 --> 58:28.360
- People at the club...
- No.

58:28.560 --> 58:32.155
There's the Ski Race tomorrow
and George is my pilot.

58:32.360 --> 58:34.794
- Which Mr Eastman?
- Mr George Eastman.

58:35.000 --> 58:41.633
Call for you, George. You'd better
bend an ear, Angela, it's a woman.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.114
Hello?

58:49.160 --> 58:53.915
- Yes.
- I'm here at the bus station.

59:01.800 --> 59:07.113
You lied to me for the last time.
Now I want you to come and get me.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.596
- It's not too easy right now.
- Now!

59:12.080 --> 59:16.631
- I'll do it tomorrow morning?
- I said now!

59:16.840 --> 59:22.039
If you're not here in half an hour,
I'll come and tell them everything!

59:23.400 --> 59:26.676
Yes, I'll leave right away.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.909
Let's not go to Florida this winter.
Let's stay here.

59:32.840 --> 59:38.472
It was a friend of my mother's.
She's not well.

59:38.680 --> 59:42.593
- I hope it's not serious.
- I don't know.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.118
I ought to get home.
I ought get a plane tonight.

59:48.320 --> 59:52.598
- If it's not serious, do come back.
- I will, thank you.

59:52.800 --> 59:56.839
- If you'll excuse me, I'll go pack.
- Certainly. Goodbye, George.

59:57.040 --> 59:59.508
Goodbye, George.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.716
George, how long will you be gone?

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:16.276
I don't know, darling.
I just don't know.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.438
You will come back
as soon as you can?

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.315
- As soon as I can.
- You promise?

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.033
I promise.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.320
Are you crazy, coming up here?

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.717
Phoning me like that
with my whole family listening in?

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.516
You weren't staying with your family.
You were staying with Angela Vickers.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.718
I'm through waiting for you.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.434
You're gonna marry me tomorrow,

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.760
or I'll tell the newspapers
everything, then I'll kill myself!

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.476
- Don't talk like that.
- You make me talk like that.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.639
We'll go to Warsaw in the morning
and get married.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.517
Let's get out of here.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.555
I won't get out of here until
you say that you're gonna do it!

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.716
All right. Come on.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.954
It's a holiday.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.434
Look, Al.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.555
Look, it's not my fault!

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.709
Besides, one day more is
not gonna make any difference.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.630
There's a wonderful lake
near here, Loon Lake,

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.276
just the place you've always
wanted to go for a honeymoon.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.836
We could go there.
There's a lodge on it, too.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.998
If you like, we could spend
the day there,

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.636
and tomorrow
we can come back here.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.799
- Al, are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.197
Tell you what, let's make a holiday
of it. Everybody else is.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.190
Why don't we get some sandwiches
and have a picnic on the lake?

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.791
- How's that?
- That sounds pretty good.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.348
Look, Al, let's not quarrel any more.
Let's try and make the best of it.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.472
All right, let's make the best of it.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.152
I should have stopped at that
last station. Yep, bone dry!

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.196
- Stupid!
- Is the lodge far from here?

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.358
No, it's only just around the bend.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:07.279
Tell you what, why don't we take
our lunch and go down to the landing?

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.995
We can rent a boat
and have our picnic now.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.716
I can pick up the gas later
and come back for the car.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.232
- How does it sound?
- It sounds wonderful!

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.198
- It is beautiful!
- Yeah.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.110
- How much to rent a boat?
- 25 cents an hour. $2 all day.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.796
Are there many people
out on the lake today?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.753
You've got it all to yourself.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.879
- Are you people at the lodge?
- Yeah. That is, we will be tonight.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.915
- Spend a couple of days there.
- You'll have to sign for it.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.838
Sure.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.636
Thanks a lot.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.310
- That's funny.
- What?

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.640
I know another guy named Gilbert
Edwards. Lives over at Westbrook.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.318
Pretty common name.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.078
only two times I ever heard.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.553
- It doesn't leak, does it?
- I don't rent leaky boats!

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.514
Don't worry, my husband's
a very good swimmer.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.276
It's so lonely here.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.037
It's like we were the only
two people left in the world.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.753
Maybe we are.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.748
Maybe when we get back to shore,
everybody will have disappeared.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.555
I'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.031
Then we could go anywhere.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.676
We could live
in the biggest house in the world.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.874
I'd like to live in a little house,
just big enough for the two of us.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.276
only there's gonna be
more than two of us.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.555
What's the matter? You look sick.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.354
Nothing! I'm out of breath.
I'm not used to rowing.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.680
Rest for a while, dear.
We can just drift.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.877
After all, we're not going anywhere.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:43.158
Look behind you.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.636
"Star light, star bright,"

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.390
"wish me luck, wish me light,
make my wish come true tonight."

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.069
Did you make a wish?

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.755
What did you wish?

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.791
Nothing.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.709
Afraid it won't come true
if you tell?

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.631
I'm sorry that I've been
so nasty to you.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.116
I didn't mean it.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.272
It's just things happen,
and you just don't stay the same.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.198
I will make it up to you.
I'll stick by you.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:37.358
I do love you, George.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:46.356
- We ought to get back. It's dark.
- That old man'll think we drowned!

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.112
Let's drift for a while. I'm not
afraid of the dark. It's so nice.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.953
I'll tell you what I wished.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.118
I wished that you loved me again.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.629
You'll see, we'll make a go of it
if we give ourselves the chance.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:23.153
We'll go where nobody knows us.
We'll get jobs, maybe together.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.480
We'll do things together and go out
together, like any married couple.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.511
After a while, you'll settle down
and be content with what you've got,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.757
instead of working yourself up
over things.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.396
It's the little things in life
that count.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.673
We'll have to scrimp and save,
but we'll have each other.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.634
- I'm not afraid of being poor.
- Stop it, Al!

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.032
- Why? What's the matter?
- Just stop it!

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.919
George?

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.279
What did you think of
when you saw the star?

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.399
You wished that you weren't here
with me, didn't you?

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.991
You wished I was where
you'd never have to see me again.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.676
Maybe you wished that I was dead.
Do you wish that I was dead?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.634
No, I didn't! Just leave me alone.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.350
Poor George. I know it isn't easy
for you. I shouldn't have said that.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.628
Stay where you are.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.516
Who's there?

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.914
I'm trying to find the road.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.512
I got lost.
You know where the road is?

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.190
It's down the trail
about a quarter of a mile.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.110
Quiet, boy, quiet. Now stay there.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.792
- Good morning, Mr Marlowe.
- Good morning, Mack.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.116
It's for you. The coroner.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.476
Yes, Doctor?

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.593
oh? Just wait a minute, will you?
Bob, get these facts.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.592
All right now.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.273
Yes. Young couple drowned.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.956
Give me all the facts.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.319
- Is Miss Vickers around?
- No, she's playing tennis.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.114
Everybody's gone somewhere.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.958
Thank you.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.192
Mr Eastman?

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.153
- Do you feel well?
- Yeah, fine.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.036
Hello, George. It's been centuries!

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.915
- She said you were playing tennis.
- I was watching them.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.478
I haven't eaten anything since you've
been away. Well, hardly anything.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.433
Don't go away again, George.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.511
Here, come and sit with me.
How is your mother?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.274
She's much better. It wasn't
as serious as they thought.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.596
I'm glad of that.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.875
You look very tired.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:16.199
I didn't get much sleep. I was even
a little airsick on the plane.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.512
Poor George.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:26.597
Anyway, I've got good news.
Mother and Dad are beginning to melt.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.792
You're winning them over
with your boyish charm.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.152
They'll let us announce it when l
come home from school at Christmas.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.514
- At Christmas? Let's run away.
- Run away?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.837
- Right now.
- But we don't have to.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.749
Not the way things are going.
Mother will want a big wedding.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:52.910
I've always dreamed of having one as
long as I can remember. All girls do.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.915
Now don't start getting moody again!

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.671
Come on, you change
and I'll meet you on the terrace.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.550
- Any identification on the girl?
- Yeah, this employment card.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.228
From the Eastman lndustries.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.034
Alice Tripp or something.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.273
The man gave his name
as Gilbert Edwards?

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.754
Yeah.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.635
You can drag that lake,
you won't find him.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.789
- How do you figure that, Bear Bait?
- I figure he left here in an auto.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.276
When I went up to my cabin
around suppertime,

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.597
there was a Coupé
parked in the woods up there.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.030
About nine o'clock,

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.755
somebody started up that auto
and drove off awfully fast.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.076
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:04.389
George, where you been? Got another
woman stashed around someplace?

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.991
- You've been gone so long.
- Can't we be alone somewhere?

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.956
- We could take the speedboat.
- Yeah.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.915
So they wanna be alone. We can't
have that. Come on, Lazy Bones!

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.954
Go!

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.594
How about some company?
Come on, everybody!

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.510
- There's no room for you!
- We'll fix that.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.515
District Attorney Frank Marlowe's
officers investigate further.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.678
An hour ago,
the coroner informed the press

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.838
that although the girl's death
was caused by drowning,

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.476
bruises would indicate
that a struggle took place.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.035
The District Attorney has evidence

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.198
that the girl's male companion
may still be alive.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.949
Three Boy Scouts have reported
that a young man, visibly upset...

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.476
You look tired, George.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.354
- That's what I told him.
- Take a rest.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.111
I think maybe that's a good idea.
Excuse me, won't you?

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.950
- Any news on the drowning?
- The papers see it as a murder.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.676
- He's alive and he's drowned her.
- You read too many mysteries.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.189
She was probably a chatterbox,

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.188
and he picked her up
and threw her overboard!

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.630
- I've been looking for you, sir.
- What is it?

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.595
Mr Vickers would like to see you
alone. He's in the living room, sir.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.796
Sit down, will you?

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.118
I thought that you and I might
have a chat before dinner.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.278
- Care for a drink?
- Please.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:33.352
I'm gonna make it a double. I'm gonna
be a little bit personal, George.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.518
It's about you and Angela and
this talk about your getting married.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.278
I don't know whether
I'm for you or against you.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:50.077
- I don't know you well enough.
- I know how you feel, Mr Vickers.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.990
Who am I to think of marrying Angela?
Angela has everything.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.149
Talk of marriage aside, we know
almost nothing about your background.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:06.993
There's not much to know. What there
is, I've wanted to tell you myself.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.436
My family is...
We were very poor people.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.869
My family devoted their lives
to a kind of religious work.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.757
Conducting sidewalk services,
street singing.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.875
I was part of all that,

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.790
until the law came along and said
I ought to go to school.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.315
I only went to school
till I was 1 3 years old.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.877
We didn't ever have any money
for anything, so I left home.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:50.278
I was gonna do something about it.
I took any job.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.519
Busboy, elevator operator, caddie.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.678
I had no training, no education.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.279
Then I came here,
went to work for my uncle.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.628
That's my background, Mr Vickers.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:19.197
There's nothing very much
to recommend any approval.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.037
But I love Angela more than
anything in the world.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.198
I'd do anything to make her happy.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:34.235
Even if it's right that
I shouldn't see her any more.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.038
Easy, boy.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.118
Forthrightness is a prime virtue.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.958
I admire your frankness.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.950
I should apologise for eavesdropping,
but I'm glad I listened.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.552
Does that answer all your questions?

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.673
All I ask is that you two
don't do anything hasty.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.673
- Let's get out.
- A drive.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.192
- I just wanna be alone with you.
- Let's go.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.993
I can't believe that this horrible
thing could happen to Alice.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.638
- She was such a sweet, quiet girl.
- Ever meet any of her boyfriends?

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:41.516
There was a young man, but he hasn't
been around in a few weeks.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.790
And who was he?

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.155
It's a small town. Any scandal would
hurt my business something awful.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.478
There will be a scandal
if you don't cooperate.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:24:01.199
I never met him, mind you,
but the girls said he was an Eastman.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.439
But it couldn't be...
Not one of the Eastmans!

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.638
Get me the District Attorney's office
in Warsaw.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.278
Here we go!

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.040
Look, he's gaining.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.554
Safe! Safe and sound!

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.676
Calling car 41.
Man believed in your vicinity...

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.237
- The third time this summer.
- I can't understand it!

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.230
Height 5'10", hair dark,
complexion fair, build light.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:21.353
- What's your name?
- George Eastman.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:39.270
I'd hate to some day be picking up
the pieces of a pretty girl like you.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.234
- Take it easy, will you?
- Anything you say.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.753
I just love that officer.
He's so bloodcurdling.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:58.073
And he writes such a nice hand.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.876
Darling, what is it?

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.630
I'm tired, very tired.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.593
Yes, you must be.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.589
Darling, let's never leave this
place. Let's just stay here alone.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.755
Don't let father upset you.
I'm the one who counts.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.434
You're the only one.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.076
The only one.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.278
People are gonna say things, I know.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.871
Things about me. About me, I know.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.518
- It's gonna make you stop loving me.
- Don't talk like that!

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.708
- I was asleep.
- You were dreaming.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.994
You were talking.
You said, "Not my fault."

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.476
Then you said something
I couldn't make out.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.276
Then you said,
"Angela, don't hate me."

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:47.349
That was a bad dream, a false dream,
because I'll always love you.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.391
We'd better go now. Mother's liable
to send out a posse for us.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.758
You go in. I'll be along in a minute.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.518
Every time you leave me for a minute,
it's like goodbye.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.755
I like to believe it means
you can't live without me.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.313
Is your name George Eastman?

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.434
Yes.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:31:00.314
- You're under arrest.
- Why? What for?

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:07.312
Start walking back down the road and
you'll find out. Go on, get going.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.592
And no monkey business, either.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.556
That's him all right.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.193
Mr Marlowe, here's your baby.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:29.797
You're George Eastman? I suppose
you know what you're charged with?

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.672
No.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:36.634
You don't know anything
about the murder of Alice Tripp?

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.559
- I'm not guilty.
- We've evidence.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.276
- You're not going to deny it?
- Yes, I deny it.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.915
Let's take you to the Vickers' and
see what your friends say about you.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.193
Please don't take me back there!
I'll tell you all I can.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.119
Don't take me back there.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:05.437
I didn't intend to. I just wanted
to see what you'd have to say.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.876
Take him to Warsaw, boys,
and lock him up.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:24.308
We'll go to the Vickers' and
see what they have to say.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:28.752
Say he's a relative,
came to the house once. Got that?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.713
And have Hollister take his name off.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.479
You had no inkling of his relations
with that girl?

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.794
No.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.596
None of you knew
of this boy's double life?

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.074
No.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:02.713
Mr Marlowe, if you've no further
questions for my daughter and me...

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.878
-...will you excuse us?
- of course.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:13.470
Mr Vickers, I have no desire
to harass an innocent person.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.117
I'd like to keep your daughter free
of scandal, but if the papers...

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.279
I'll keep her out of the papers.
You keep her out of the trial.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.109
That may not be possible.
The defence would have to agree.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.357
The defence will agree to it.
I'll see to that.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.636
I'll engage the boy's lawyers.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.992
If it appears he's innocent,
I'll spend $1 00,000 to defend him.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.509
And if he's guilty?

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:44.669
I won't spend a cent to save him
from the electric chair.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.358
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Lulu.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.956
The boy's tired.
I think that's enough for today.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.116
I guess you're right.

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.077
Mr Bellows, has there been
any word from...?

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.912
From Miss Vickers?

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.553
No, George.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.718
When Mr Eastman engaged us
to defend you,

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:35.199
we made an agreement not to drag
Miss Vickers into the case.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.875
- of course.
- It's in your interest, too.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.038
Her appearance on the stand
would be irrelevant.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:46.677
I feel it might be damaging
for you, too. We'll be back.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.069
"After I got her on the lake,
I couldn't go through with it."

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.714
"Then the boat turned over."

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.751
You know, Art, he sold me.
I believe his story.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.959
No more newspapers, Lulu.
Remember, I told you.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.474
The people of this state charge
that murder in the first degree

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.639
has been committed by the prisoner
at the bar, George Eastman.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.673
They charge that George Eastman

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.954
wilfully, and with malice
and cruelty and deception,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.798
murdered,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.835
then sought to conceal from justice
the body of Alice Tripp.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.230
It will be for you,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.878
to decide what shall be done
with this man,

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.675
who has flouted every moral law,
broken every commandment...

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.677
...who has crowned his infamy
with murder.

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.959
- What were Alice's feelings for him?
- Everybody knew she was in love.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.720
What was this rule exactly?

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.516
It was to keep the foreman and staff
from fooling around with the girls.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:18.395
one night last August,
I called Alice to the telephone.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.390
It was him calling.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.479
Doctor, you never saw
this young man?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.797
No, but after she left my office,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.878
she sat talking
with a man in a Coupé.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.036
- objection!
- Sustained.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.913
Along about nine o'clock,
he stumbled into my camp.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.270
He was wet and looked scared.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.793
This man was at the bus station
with this girl.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.956
They were quarrelling.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.391
She said she wouldn't leave
unless he promised.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.594
Had violence been done to Miss
Tripp prior to her death by drowning?

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.476
She'd been struck by an instrument
with sufficient force to stun her.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.389
I told him there wasn't
nobody else on the lake.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.194
Then he signed Gilbert Edwards.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.471
Having signed a false name,
he then proceeded to make sure

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.752
what took place would be
observed by no one?

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.997
No one except the person
who'd be unable to testify,

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.555
the girl he drowned?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.594
- The prosecution must not...
- I withdraw the question.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.950
The people rest.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.037
This boy is on trial
for the act of murder,

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.549
not for the thought of murder.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.832
Between the idea and deed
there's a difference.

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.876
If you find this boy guilty in desire
but not guilty in deed...

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.074
...then he must walk out of this
courtroom as free as you or l.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:02.868
However, since the prosecutor lacked
evidence, he's given you prejudice.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.390
Lacking facts,
he's given you fantasy.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.795
of all the witnesses before you,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.958
not one actually saw what happened.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.796
I will now call to the stand
an eyewitness, the only eyewitness.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.949
The only one who knows the truth,
the whole truth.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.678
George Eastman,
please take the stand.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.394
When we got to the lake, I suggested
we go rowing before it got dark.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:44.196
Tell me, why did you give
a false name to the boat keeper?

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.632
We were going to stay at the lodge,
and we weren't married,

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.628
so I thought it better
not to give our real names.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.517
Why did you engage the boat
to row the girl out onto the lake?

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.469
In the back of my mind
was the thought of drowning her.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.436
But I didn't want to think
such things!

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.478
I couldn't help myself, I couldn't!

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:28.673
What happened after you rowed out?

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.634
I knew that I couldn't
go through with it.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.834
- Then you had a change of heart.
- I object. He's leading the witness.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.476
objection sustained. Counsel will
refrain from leading the witness.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.636
Yes, your honour.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.239
What happened then?

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.392
That was when we decided
we ought to get back to the lodge.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.275
She started talking
about getting married

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.109
and what our life together
would be like.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:07.312
What was your reaction
to her talking that way?

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.593
She just looked at me.
She knew it was hopeless.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.949
She accused me of wishing her dead.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.276
Did you wish she were dead?

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:23.109
No, I didn't!
I wasn't thinking of that any more!

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.278
What were you thinking of
at that moment?

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.878
I was thinking of somebody else.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.512
Another girl.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.639
You were thinking that this other
girl and her world were lost forever.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.958
What did you say
to Alice's accusation?

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:55.709
I told her it wasn't true,
I didn't want her to die.

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.673
Wasn't she alarmed or frightened?

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.513
- She even said, "Poor George!"
- Go on.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.791
Then she started toward me
from the back of the boat.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.390
I told her to stay where she was,
but she didn't.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.229
She kept coming toward me,
then she started to fall.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.512
I started to get up.
Then everything turned over.

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.951
In a second, we were in the water.
I was stunned.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.993
Something must have
hit me as I fell in.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.670
It all happened so fast,
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.271
George, was Alice conscious
when she fell into the water?

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.916
Yes, I heard her scream
but couldn't see her,

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.190
'cause she was on the other side.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.960
So I swam around to the other side.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.269
She was... When I got there,
she'd gone down.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.476
I never saw her again.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:02.435
Do you solemnly swear
that you did not strike her?

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.073
I swear it!

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.874
- That you did not push her in?
- I did not!

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.390
That it was an accident
undesired by you?

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.230
I do. I do. I do.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.636
That's all, your honour.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.075
That night when you left the party
at the house at Bride's Lake

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.590
to meet Alice Tripp
in the bus station...

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.557
...do you remember leaving
anything behind you?

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.548
No, I don't. I don't remember
leaving anything.

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.788
I'm referring to your heart!
Did you leave that behind you?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.313
Did you, Eastman? out there
on that terrace in the moonlight?

01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:59.715
You left behind the girl you loved,

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.198
and with her your hopes,
your ambitions, your dreams.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:06.470
Didn't you, Eastman?

01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.639
You left behind everything you
wanted, including the girl you loved.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.276
But you planned to return to it,
didn't you?

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.436
Answer me!

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.558
Yes.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:27.469
When you told them all that night
you were going to visit your mother,

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:30.478
you were lying, weren't you?

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.151
When you gave the boat keeper
a false name, you were lying again?

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.634
Yes.

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.515
When you drove up to Loon Lake,
what reason did you give Alice Tripp

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:43.553
for parking so far away
from the lodge?

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.435
- We were out of gas.
- Weren't you lying again?

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.312
- Yes.
- Lies!

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.637
Every move you made
was built on lies.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.914
Yet now you're facing death, you
can't tell anything but the truth!

01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.475
All the same, it's true!

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.832
I didn't kill her.

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.478
So you persist in lying
about that, too. We'll see.

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.511
Step down into the boat

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.669
and show the jury what happened
when the boat overturned.

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.916
Take the same position you had
at the time of the drowning.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.074
When the girl rose in the boat
to come towards you,

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.033
did she stumble about there?

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:45.956
- Speak up.
- Yes.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.832
And then?

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.759
She fell sideways into the water.

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.635
- Then what?
- The boat turned over on top of us.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:59.152
- What happened then?
- I couldn't see very clearly.

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:03.319
There was a thud,
as if the edge of the boat hit her.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.794
Very likely!

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.438
After this accidental blow, how far
apart were you when you came up?

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.953
I don't know exactly.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.630
You couldn't have been
more than a yard apart!

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.637
It was further.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.469
From there to the jury box
or halfway or what?

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.796
From here to the jury box.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.235
Not really. When you and she
came up, you're nearly 20 feet apart!

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.319
- Why couldn't you swim toward her?
- I don't know.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.590
Step over here.

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.639
Was the boat as far as from here
to the bailiff?

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.114
I don't know.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.154
You're telling me
you couldn't swim to this weak girl

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:01.432
and buoy her up
till you could reach this boat?

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.155
You're lying! She was drowning,
and you just let her drown!

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:11.390
She was defenceless, you picked up
this oar and crashed it on her head!

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.237
You pushed that poor girl into
the lake. You watched her drown.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.073
- lsn't that the truth?
- No.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.631
That's all, your honour.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.834
By the premature adoption
of an extreme belief and creed,

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.113
it is well to understand this in
looking to the duties of adult life,

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.276
in particular, the married state,

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:56.555
when you will emerge into a world of
grown-up problems for the first time.

01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.514
Then he or she will view
the enthusiasms of youth...

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:08.879
...problems which are the frequent
products of a sheltered immaturity.

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:15.030
It is when the hastily adopted
beliefs of youth are insufficient...

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.469
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, your honour.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.876
The defendant will rise.

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.273
The clerk will read the verdict.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.833
We find the defendant,
George Eastman,

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.191
guilty of murder in the first degree.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.276
order in the court!

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.478
- Hello, Mrs Eastman.
- Mama.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.436
- My boy.
- Did you see the governor?

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.031
It's no use.
The governor couldn't be moved.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.350
Your mother's done everything
a mother could do. That I know.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.030
Death is a little thing.
You mustn't be afraid of it.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:21.471
You must fear now
only for your immortal soul.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:27.630
If that sin is on your soul, my son,
you must make your peace with God.

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.389
I don't believe
I'm guilty of all this.

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.389
They don't know. I wish I knew!

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.593
If you are guilty, then I am guilty.
I must share your guilt.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.394
Mama, don't blame yourself.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:50.870
They say only God and ourselves
know what our sins and sorrows are.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.311
Perhaps in this case, only God knows.

01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.473
George, perhaps you've hidden
the full truth even from yourself.

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:04.798
I don't wanna hide anything.
I wanna know.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.437
There's one thing you've never told
anyone, even yourself.

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:15.838
There's one point in your story that
holds the answer you're looking for.

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.678
Yes...

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:24.479
When you were on the lake with that
poor girl, and the boat capsized...

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:30.555
...and there was a moment
when you might have saved her.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.035
I wanted to save her.

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.590
But I just couldn't.

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.038
Whom were you thinking of?

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:46.199
Whom were you thinking of
just at that moment?

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:54.033
Were you thinking of Alice?
Were you thinking of the other girl?

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.519
Then...in your heart was murder,
George.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.154
God bless you, my boy.
God forgive me if I've failed you.

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.273
I came to see you.

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.478
I've thought lots about you, George.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.956
All the time.

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.273
I went away to school...to learn.

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.673
I don't think I learned very much.

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:46.832
I love you, George.
I wanted you to know that.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.478
I guess there's nothing more to say.

01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:21.719
I know something now
that I didn't know before.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.233
I am guilty of a lot of things,
most of what they say of me.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:35.074
All the same,
I'll go on loving you...

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.031
...for as long as I live.

01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:45.031
Love me for the time I have left,
then forget me.

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.918
Goodbye, George.

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:28.999
It seems like we always spend the
best part of our time saying goodbye.

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.673
"ln my Father's house
of many mansions,"

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.838
"l go to prepare a place for you."

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:59.319
"And I will receive you unto myself
that where I am ye may be also."

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.238
You'll have to go now.

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.629
"l am the resurrection and the life.
He who believeth in me..."

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:10.434
Come on, son.

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.878
"And whosoever liveth and
believeth in me...shall never die."

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.911
So long, kid.

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.478
You're going to a better world
than this.

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.435
Goodbye, George. I'll be seein' you.
