WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:11.645
AUNT RACHEL,
COULD YOU PLEASE HURRY UP?

00:11.712 --> 00:14.048
SOMEBODY MIGHT SEE ME
LIKE THIS.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.483
STAND STILL.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.119
BESIDES, YOU LOOK
KIND OF CUTE.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.555
THAT'S IT.
I'M TAKING THIS THING OFF.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.092
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO WEAR THIS
TONIGHT. I'LL BE DONE.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.761
THE DRESS IS BAD ENOUGH. BUT
THIS PUSH UP BRA IS KILLING ME.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.431
OWW!

00:30.498 --> 00:32.600
OH. SORRY.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PIN.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.302
DARN. THAT WAS
THE LAST ONE.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.804
DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.553
EDWARD.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.655
DAD.

00:54.722 --> 00:59.660
SON, I THINK IT'S TIME
WE HAD A LITTLE TALK.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.941
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:14.007 --> 01:15.476
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:15.543 --> 01:18.746
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:18.812 --> 01:22.250
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:22.316 --> 01:26.787
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:26.854 --> 01:29.957
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:30.023 --> 01:33.961
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:34.027 --> 01:37.498
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:37.565 --> 01:41.135
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:42.370 --> 01:45.539
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:45.606 --> 01:49.443
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:49.510 --> 01:52.446
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:52.513 --> 01:56.217
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

01:56.284 --> 01:59.720
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:59.787 --> 02:02.923
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,
ROOM FOR ME *

02:02.990 --> 02:07.261
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:07.328 --> 02:10.598
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:10.664 --> 02:14.668
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:29.417 --> 02:30.484
MOM, WE GOT TO TALK.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.486
CLEAN YOUR ROOM.
TALK LATER.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.191
I WANT MY ROOM
AS I LIKE IT.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.860
THAT ROOM BELONGS
TO YOUR FATHER AND ME.

02:39.927 --> 02:43.664
WE'RE LETTING YOU USE IT
TILL YOU GO TO COLLEGE.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.900
IF I CLEAN IT,
CAN I GO TO THE DANCE?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.536
I TOLD YOU NO.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.404
IS THAT
YOUR FINAL WORD?

02:50.471 --> 02:53.574
IT WAS MY FINAL WORD
LAST MONTH, LAST WEEK,

02:53.641 --> 02:56.677
AND UNTIL YOU'RE 15,
AND THAT'S FINAL.

03:01.081 --> 03:05.018
AUNT RACHEL, HOW OLD
WERE YOU WHEN YOU
STARTED DATING?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.321
OH, GOSH, HONEY.
I WAITED A LONG TIME.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.358
I DIDN'T HAVE MY FIRST DATE
UNTIL 10 OR 11.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.528
MOM.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.629
NO.

03:16.997 --> 03:17.698
HI.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.766
HI, BABY.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.368
DADDY'S HOME!

03:20.434 --> 03:23.003
I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH TODAY.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.306
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.345
BY THE WAY, CAN I GO
TO A PARTY SATURDAY?

03:31.412 --> 03:33.381
SOUNDS GREAT.
HAVE FUN.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.784
CARL, SHE'S 13.
SHE'S TOO YOUNG TO DATE.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.951
WHEN EDDIE WAS 13,

03:38.018 --> 03:40.354
YOU LET HIM TAKE
BRENDA JACKSON
ROLLER-SKATING.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.722
THAT WAS A DATE.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.923
THAT'S TRUE.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.694
YEAH, AND EDDIE
HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.629
THAT'S ALSO TRUE.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.431
YOU KNOW, MOM,
IN SOME COUNTRIES,

03:50.498 --> 03:52.266
GIRLS GET MARRIED
AT 13.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.168
SURE...AND THEY DIE
AT 30.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.905
YOU WANT TO DIE YOUNG?
GO TO THE DANCE.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.175
WAS THAT A YES?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.612
NO. I THINK THAT WAS
A THREAT ON YOUR LIFE.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.115
MOM JUST DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ME,

04:08.181 --> 04:09.450
BUT YOU DO.

04:09.517 --> 04:13.020
YOU'RE THE GREATEST DAD
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.889
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.857
IT'S WORKING?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.426
YEAH.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.528
I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

04:22.896 --> 04:23.597
HONEY.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.698
UH-HUH?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.000
WE OUGHT TO LET LAURA
GO TO THE PARTY.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.669
CARL, SHE'S 13.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.837
IF SHE'S STARTS
DATING NOW,

04:29.903 --> 04:32.473
SHE'LL GET SERIOUS,
HE'LL GET SERIOUS,

04:32.540 --> 04:35.409
AND THEN THEY BOTH GET SERIOUS
AND THAT'S SERIOUS.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.713
HARRIETTE, WILL YOU
GET SERIOUS?

04:39.780 --> 04:40.614
THIS IS A DANCE.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.816
SHE'S GOT TO BE HOME
BY 10:00.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.518
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.488
HONEY, HER FRIENDS
ARE GOING. LET HER GO.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.956
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,

04:49.022 --> 04:53.394
I'LL HAVE THE SQUAD CAR
CHECK ON HER EVERY HOUR.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.796
CARL, IF YOU WANT
HER TO GO, FINE.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.898
REMEMBER, I'M DEAD SET
AGAINST IT.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.767
AW, THANK YOU, HONEY.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.370
I'M GLAD WE AGREE
ON THIS.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.576
* EVERY STEP I TAKE *

05:08.642 --> 05:10.978
* YOU WILL BE THERE *

05:11.044 --> 05:13.246
* EVERY STEP I MAKE *

05:13.313 --> 05:15.115
* WE'LL BE TOGETHER.. *

05:15.182 --> 05:17.651
LAURA,
CLOSE THAT BOOK.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.219
THE DANCE
IS TOMORROW.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.188
LET'S GET
YOU A DATE.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.090
FORGET IT.
IT'S TOO LATE.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.359
THE GOOD GUYS ARE TAKEN.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.928
HEY, THERE'S
YOUR BROTHER.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.330
HE'S SO COOL.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.367
MY BROTHER...COOL?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.803
YOU ARE
A SICK PERSON.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.270
HEY, SIS.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.040
WANT TO SIT
WITH US, EDDIE?

05:40.107 --> 05:42.776
PENNY, PENNY,
PENNY.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.046
I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.617
I CAN'T BE SEEN SITTING
WITH SEVENTH GRADERS.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.320
I WAS JUST KIDDING.
I'M A GREAT KIDDER.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.389
I THOUGHT
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.491
STEVE URKEL'S OUTSIDE.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.960
HE'S GOING TO ASK YOU
TO THE DANCE.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.595
HEY,
THAT'S GREAT.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.032
YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD GO OUT
WITH STEVE URKEL,

06:05.098 --> 06:07.701
THE MOUSE EATER?

06:07.768 --> 06:10.971
THE KID EATS ONE MOUSE,
AND HE'S BRANDED FOR LIFE.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.974
YOU'RE JUST
BUILDING YOUR REPUTATION.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.144
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DATE GUYS
WITH MICE ON THEIR BREATH.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.815
WOW. YOUR BROTHER'S
GOOD-LOOKING AND SMART.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.486
WHY DO WANT ME
TO GO WITH URKEL?

06:25.553 --> 06:27.555
YOU WOULDN'T.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.123
TRUE,
BUT I HAVE A DATE.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.626
YOU WAITED TOO LONG
TO PUT YOURSELF
ON THE MARKET.

06:32.693 --> 06:36.063
FACE IT, GIRL.
YOU'RE AT
THE SALE TABLE.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.634
NOT URKEL,
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.335
WELL,
DON'T LOOK NOW,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.605
BUT HE'S COMING
THIS WAY.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.586
HI, LAURA.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.791
I HEAR YOU CAN'T
GET A DATE FOR THE DANCE,

07:03.857 --> 07:06.527
SO YOU WANT
TO GO WITH ME?

07:06.594 --> 07:09.763
TAKE A HIKE, URKEL.
SHE'D RATHER EAT WORMS.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.633
OKAY. SOME OTHER
TIME THEN.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.905
LOOK. THERE'S
MARK NEWHOUSE.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.007
DON'T LOOK.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.276
YOU CAN FORGET MARK.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.613
HE'LL ASK
JO BETH HENSLEY.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.047
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.517
IF YOU PAID
MORE ATTENTION
IN STUDY HALL

07:29.583 --> 07:30.718
INSTEAD OF STUDYING,

07:30.784 --> 07:34.588
YOU'D KNOW
THESE THINGS.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
I DON'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.625
IF I DON'T
GET A DATE,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.627
I'LL BE HUMILIATED.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.596
DON'T GET UPSET.
WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.673
DID I MENTION MY DAD
KNOWS WAYNE NEWTON?

07:55.743 --> 07:57.611
MAKE HIM GO AWAY.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.847
GET OUT OF HERE, GOAT-FACE.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.253
EXCUSE ME.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.966
FINISH YOUR
BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.570
BRUSSELS SPROUTS
MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.107
AT MY TABLE,
EAT THEM.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.544
WHAT YOU DO
ON YOUR TIME
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.248
I KNOW THIS DANCE
IS A BIG MOMENT
IN YOUR LIFE,

08:35.315 --> 08:36.817
SO I'LL MAKE
YOUR DRESS,

08:36.884 --> 08:39.653
SOMETHING WITH PUFFY SLEEVES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.955
I THINK YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF
THE TROUBLE.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.124
NOBODY'S ASKED ME
TO THE DANCE.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.694
WELL, HONEY, I'M SURE
SOMEBODY WILL.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.663
RACHEL'S RIGHT. THERE'S
PLENTY OF BOYS OUT THERE

08:49.730 --> 08:51.699
TRYING TO GET
THE COURAGE TO CALL YOU.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.768
THAT PHONE WILL
RING ANY MINUTE.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.070
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.115
ARE WE GOING
TO WAIT LONG?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.619
NOBODY'S
EVER GOING TO CALL.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.021
I GO THROUGH THIS
EVERY DANCE.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.056
I KNOW WHEN
A DANCE IS COMING UP.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.959
THE PHONE GOES DEAD.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.165
SEE, CARL,
I TOLD YOU

09:25.232 --> 09:27.901
SHE'S JUST TOO YOUNG
FOR THIS DATING THING.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.303
RACHEL, YOU MAKE
THAT DRESS.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.674
LAURA WILL GET A DATE.
I GUARANTEE IT.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.482
HELLO. MR. URKEL?

09:42.549 --> 09:44.952
YES. CARL WINSLOW.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.354
RIGHT. REMEMBER,
WE MET AT THE PET SHOP.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.023
YOU WERE BUYING MICE.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.259
RIGHT.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.495
WELL, LISTEN,
I NEED A LITTLE FAVOR.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.265
DOES YOUR SON STEVE,

09:58.331 --> 09:59.967
BY ANY CHANCE,
HAPPEN TO HAVE A DATE

10:00.033 --> 10:02.870
TO THE PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.004
OH, NO?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.839
WELL, LISTEN...

10:16.083 --> 10:17.617
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:17.685 --> 10:20.654
NOT REALLY.
I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.690
I UNDERSTAND.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.131
YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.702
SO WHAT IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A DATE FOR THE DANCE?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.170
I CAN TELL YOU
FROM YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

10:37.237 --> 10:39.172
DATING'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.875
SAY WHAT?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.544
WELL, IT'S VERY OVERRATED.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.280
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS A DATE?

10:47.347 --> 10:48.581
TWO VERY NERVOUS PEOPLE

10:48.648 --> 10:50.283
TRYING TO THINK
OF COOL THINGS TO SAY

10:50.350 --> 10:53.420
SO ONE DOESN'T THINK
THE OTHER ONE'S STUPID.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.790
BE THANKFUL
NOBODY CALLED.

10:56.857 --> 10:57.958
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CROCK

10:58.025 --> 11:00.427
I'VE EVER HEARD
IN MY LIFE.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.564
OKAY, LOOK.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.701
I KNOW YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON MARK NEWHOUSE.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.737
IF YOU WANT HIM
TO TAKE YOU,

11:09.803 --> 11:12.139
CALL HIM
AND ASK HIM.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.541
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T WANNA
GO WITH ME?

11:14.607 --> 11:17.410
THEN YOU'LL LOOK
LIKE A FOOL.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.350
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T CALL HIM.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.685
NO GUTS, NO GLORY.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.221
I'M GOING
TO SHOOT SOME HOOPS.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.994
LAURA...

11:34.061 --> 11:35.763
ANY GUY WHO WOULDN'T
GO OUT WITH YOU

11:35.829 --> 11:38.398
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.200
THANKS, EDDIE.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.568
HELLO, MARK?

12:15.635 --> 12:18.071
THIS IS LAURA WINSLOW.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.740
LOOK, I MAY BE RISKING
HUMILIATION HERE,

12:20.808 --> 12:23.143
BUT...

12:23.210 --> 12:26.479
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO
THE DANCE WITH ME OR WHAT?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.491
OKAY.
HERE'S THE PARTY GIRL.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.231
OHH!

12:45.465 --> 12:47.567
LAURA, YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL!

12:47.634 --> 12:49.837
WHAT ABOUT THE DRESS?

12:49.903 --> 12:52.339
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.573
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.944
DIDN'T YOU MAKE
THAT FOR YOUR
BETSY-WETSY DOLL?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.278
YEAH.
TO PUT THIS ON,

12:58.345 --> 13:01.648
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE
LAURA'S ARMS OFF.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.151
A LOOSE THREAD.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.987
MOM!

13:12.092 --> 13:14.294
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

13:14.361 --> 13:18.031
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
A TEAR-AWAY DRESS.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.968
WHAT AM I GONNA DO? I CAN'T GO
TO THE DANCE LIKE THIS.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.670
I CAN FIX IT.
GET ME SOME THREAD.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.739
HURRY. SHE DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.243
SHE WOULD IF SOMEONE
DIDN'T PULL THE THREADS.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.413
YOU DON'T SEE ME YANKING
OTHER PEOPLE'S THREADS.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.849
I KNOW WHY
THREADS ARE THERE--

13:35.916 --> 13:36.917
TO KEEP THE DRESS ON.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.452
GET UPSTAIRS!

13:44.691 --> 13:45.893
HI, HONEY.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.827
HI, BABE.
DINNER'S GOING TO BE LATE.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.897
I'M HELPING LAURA
GET READY.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.866
OH, SHE GOT A DATE.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.902
I HAD A FEELING
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

13:54.968 --> 13:58.671
SO DID STEVE--
UH...A BOY CALL?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.007
YES. SHE'S
GETTING READY NOW.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.008
[DOORBELL RINGS]

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
GET THAT.
I'LL HELP RACHEL.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.650
HI, MR. WINSLOW.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.420
I'M STEVE URKEL.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.926
IS LAURA READY
FOR THE DANCE?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.997
YEAH, STEVE.
COME RIGHT ON IN.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.301
SHE'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.403
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
MR. WINSLOW,

14:30.470 --> 14:33.006
WHEN DAD SAID
YOU'D FIXED ME UP
WITH LAURA,

14:33.073 --> 14:35.408
WHY, I THOUGHT
I'D WET MY PANTS.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.683
I'VE BEEN
CRAZY ABOUT HER

14:43.750 --> 14:45.285
SINCE THE FIRST GRADE,

14:45.352 --> 14:47.955
BUT SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT
I WAS A FREAK.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.123
GO FIGURE.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.564
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE FELT THAT WAY.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.366
NICE FLOWERS.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.400
YEAH, THANKS.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.104
ON THE WAY OVER, I
STOPPED BY THE CEMETERY.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.045
WHY NOT GO
IN THE KITCHEN

15:12.112 --> 15:14.081
AND WASH THE ROOTS?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.383
GOOD IDEA, MR. WINSLOW.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.388
NICE HOUSE FOR A COP.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.557
THANKS.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.164
EXCUSE ME.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.604
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.507
LAURA?

15:40.573 --> 15:41.941
SWEETHEART?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.743
YOU'RE, UH...

15:43.810 --> 15:46.179
DATE IS HERE.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.348
HE'S HERE?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.550
STALL HIM. I GOTTA
PUT THIS DRESS BACK TOGETHER.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.087
I CAN'T WORK
UNDER THIS KIND OF PRESSURE.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.927
HEY, DAD.
THIS IS TYRONE.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.929
NICE TO MEET
YOU, TYRONE.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.697
HE'S TAKING LAURA
TO THE DANCE.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.634
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.701
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.537
HE'S TAKING LAURA
TO THE DANCE?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.139
I FELT SORRY FOR HER.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.974
I GAVE TYRONE
10 BUCKS TO TAKE HER.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.710
I SET HER UP
WITH URKEL.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.546
THE MOUSE EATER?

16:21.114 --> 16:22.882
HE EATS MICE?

16:22.949 --> 16:23.983
WELL,
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A RUMOR.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.119
DOES SHE KNOW
HE'S TAKING HER?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.887
OF COURSE SHE DOES.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.557
HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY
SEEN HIM EAT A MOUSE?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.793
I'VE BETTER THINGS
TO DO THAN WATCH
STEVE URKEL EAT.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.530
WHAT ABOUT TYRONE?
I ALREADY GAVE HIM
THE 10 BUCKS.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.037
NOW, THAT DRESS
LOOKS EVEN BETTER.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.772
YOU LOOK
WONDERFUL, HONEY.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.773
THANKS, MOM.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.808
HEY, LAURA.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.477

16:50.543 --> 16:52.312
OH, HI, TYRONE.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.714
HE'S YOUR DATE
FOR THE NIGHT.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.784
NO, HE'S NOT.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.488
YES, HE IS.
I GAVE HIM 10 BUCKS.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.992
YOU HIRED TYRONE
TO TAKE ME
TO THE DANCE?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.560
OH, EDDIE.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.562
OH, EDDIE!

17:11.498 --> 17:13.266
EDDIE, I DON'T
NEED CHARITY.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.834
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.704
YOUR SISTER WAS RIGHT.
SHE CAN FIND HER OWN DATES.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.072
BUT, DAD--

17:19.139 --> 17:21.441
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.677
EDDIE WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING NICE.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.447
[DOORBELL RINGS]

17:29.616 --> 17:31.251
HI. I'M MARK NEWHOUSE.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.320
MARK, COME ON IN.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.855
WELL, WHAT
IS HE DOING HERE?

17:35.922 --> 17:38.091
DAD, MARK IS MY DATE.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.427
YOUR DATE?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.664
YES, CARL.
HER DATE.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.467
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S BEEN GETTING
ALL DRESSED UP?

17:47.534 --> 17:50.002
WELL, BETTER
GET GOING, KIDS.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.571
DON'T WANT TO MISS
THE BIG DANCE.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.772
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.342
HI, LAURA.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.944
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.080
WOW! ARE YOU
WEARING A BRA?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.587
WHO ARE YOU,

18:07.654 --> 18:10.457
AND WHY ARE THOSE FLOWERS
DRIPPING ON MY FLOOR?

18:12.892 --> 18:14.394
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.764
YOU CALLED LAURA
TO ASK HER OUT, RIGHT?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.432
WHY SHOULD I?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.868
MY DAD SAID YOU
SET IT ALL UP.

18:25.805 --> 18:26.539
YOU DID WHAT?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.840
WELL, HONEY--

18:27.907 --> 18:31.878
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO EMBARRASSED.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.681
BUT, LAURA, I...

18:36.183 --> 18:39.118
THANK YOU,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SUGAR?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.421
STEVE.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.990
STEVE AND TYRONE,

18:44.056 --> 18:45.558
WE WON'T BE
NEEDING YOU TONIGHT.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.395
COME ON, TYRONE.
LET'S BAIL. DATE'S OVER.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.913
LAURA, WANT TO TALK?

19:08.781 --> 19:12.519
MOM, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
HUMILIATING THIS IS?

19:12.585 --> 19:16.155
LAURA, YOUR FATHER
AND EDDIE ACTED
LIKE FOOLS,

19:16.223 --> 19:17.290
BUT THEY MEANT WELL.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.660
THEY PAID GUYS
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.496
I'M SURE YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T PAY STEVE A CENT.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.734
THIS IS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

19:28.868 --> 19:33.072
LAURA, YOU
SHOULD BE HAPPY.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.508
A VERY NICE BOY
ASKED YOU TO THE DANCE.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.678
MARK DIDN'T ASK ME.
I ASKED HIM.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.480
YOU DID?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.782
OH.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.552
WELL, HE SAID YES.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.720
THAT SHOULD
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.089
MOM, HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
HAD A FIGHT.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.791
HE WAS ON THE REBOUND.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.428
HE PROBABLY WOULD'VE
GONE WITH ANYBODY.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.465
MOM, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ME?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.368
NOTHING. THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.869
YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'RE FUNNY.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.771
YOU HAVE
A GREAT PERSONALITY.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.839
GREAT PERSONALITY?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.641
OH, I GET IT.
I'M UGLY.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.078
YOU'RE NOT UGLY.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.181
THEN WHY DIDN'T MARK
ASK ME OUT HIMSELF?

20:15.248 --> 20:17.216
BOYS ARE
SCARED TO DEATH,

20:17.284 --> 20:19.151
JUST LIKE YOU.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
BUT THAT
WILL CHANGE.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.956
MOM, DATING IS HARD.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.194
HONEY, IT'S HARD
FOR EVERYONE.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.362
IT TOOK YOUR FATHER
SIX WEEKS

20:29.429 --> 20:32.231
TO GET THE COURAGE
TO ASK ME OUT,

20:32.299 --> 20:35.067
BUT I'M GLAD HE DID.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.936
NOW COME ON.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.908
YOU GO IN THERE
AND GO WITH MARK.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.710
I THINK
HE LIKES YOU.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.944
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

20:45.011 --> 20:46.346
I'M A MOTHER.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.215
I HAVE A FEELING
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.784
THANKS, MOM.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.628
DEAR LORD, PLEASE,
LET THIS BOY LIKE HER.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.574
YOU STILL WANT TO GO
TO THE DANCE WITH ME?

21:14.641 --> 21:16.709
SURE.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.712
YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.715
I'VE LIKED YOU
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.319
GOODNIGHT, MOM.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.521
GOODNIGHT, KIDS.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.793
AHEM.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.995
DON'T BE LATE.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.968
LAURA, LAURA,
I GOT IT!

21:42.034 --> 21:44.203
RACHEL, RACHEL!
WHAT?

21:44.270 --> 21:45.372
SHE'S GONE.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.974
SHE CAN WEAR THAT
ON HER NEXT DATE.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.043
[HUMMING]

21:54.881 --> 21:57.316
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I STAY A WHILE.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.420
MY PARENTS TOLD ME
TO STAY OUT
TILL 10:00.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.559
GOT ANY CHEESE?

22:20.473 --> 22:23.976
SO, HOW WAS MY
LITTLE GIRL'S FIRST DATE?

22:24.043 --> 22:25.712
IT WAS OKAY.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.482
WELL, NOW, THAT'S IT,
JUST OKAY?

22:30.450 --> 22:32.619
WELL, FOR ABOUT
THREE HOURS,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.353
GUYS STOOD ON ONE
SIDE OF THE ROOM,

22:34.421 --> 22:35.755
GIRLS ON THE OTHER.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.924
MOSTLY, I
TALKED TO PENNY.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.926
WHICH I COULD HAVE
DONE HERE.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.360
DIDN'T YOU DANCE AT ALL?

22:41.428 --> 22:44.397
A LITTLE. WITH
15 MINUTES LEFT,

22:44.464 --> 22:47.299
MARK FINALLY GOT
ENOUGH NERVE
TO ASK ME.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.901
THEN WE HAD FUN.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.202
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING OLDER

22:50.269 --> 22:53.172
WHEN BOYS
ARE BRAVER.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.374
WELL, SWEETHEART...

22:55.442 --> 22:57.810
IF THEY GET TOO BRAVE,
YOU LET ME KNOW.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.381
OKAY, DAD.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.817
AND, SWEETHEART...

23:04.884 --> 23:08.721
I AM REAL SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I DID TONIGHT.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.157
THAT'S
ALRIGHT, DAD,

23:11.223 --> 23:13.426
BUT THE NEXT TIME
YOU FEEL LIKE
FIXING ME UP,

23:13.493 --> 23:16.162
DO ME A FAVOR,
PICTURE STEVE URKEL.
