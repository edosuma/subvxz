WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:06.807
It's been six months,
three weeks,

00:06.840 --> 00:08.509
14 hours...

00:08.542 --> 00:11.545
18 minutes since I last saw
Tina's cute little...

00:12.213 --> 00:14.115
What are you doing?

00:14.148 --> 00:16.784
Got to go.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.752
You can't hold it
for 20 minutes?

00:18.786 --> 00:22.156
I'm not going to tell Marci
I got to hit the head first.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.358
( gate rattling )

00:24.392 --> 00:26.094
( groans )

00:26.127 --> 00:28.096
Aw, come on, Tom.

00:28.129 --> 00:31.031
I promise not to shake it
more than once.

00:32.166 --> 00:35.536
( urinating )

00:35.569 --> 00:38.139
( gasps )

00:40.374 --> 00:44.345
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:44.378 --> 00:49.150
and CBS

01:19.213 --> 01:21.582
I'd have returned
the money.
A buck eighty-five.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.484
It's the principle,
not the amount.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.818
I didn't notice
at the drive-thru.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.787
I dropped the change
in the ashtray and we left.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.457
You didn't notice because you
were too busy leering

01:29.490 --> 01:30.858
at the blonde
working the window.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.460
I wasn't leering.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.495
Drooling a little, maybe.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.629
The point is,

01:35.663 --> 01:36.597
I didn't notice her mistake

01:36.630 --> 01:38.666
until after we parked

01:38.699 --> 01:41.435
and I took the change
out of the ashtray.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.503
The point is,
you did notice,

01:42.536 --> 01:44.805
which makes not returning
the money a conscious act.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.740
Well, I'd burn more than
a buck eighty-five in gas

01:46.774 --> 01:47.908
driving back there.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.343
It's going
to come back to haunt you.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.778
What is?

01:50.811 --> 01:53.381
Karma. What goes around,
comes around like a boomerang.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.383
And when yours
comes back around

01:55.416 --> 01:56.517
you better duck really low.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.187
Mm, well, you don't have to duck
if you don't believe.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.053
Believe what?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.655
Kind of a private conversation,
McGee.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.890
KATE:
With all the bad karma

02:02.923 --> 02:04.492
you've built up
with women alone,

02:04.525 --> 02:07.361
I am surprised that something
hasn't just fallen off.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.630
Missing something, DiNozzo?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.432
( phone ringing )

02:11.465 --> 02:12.266
( chuckles )

02:12.300 --> 02:13.901
Yes. Gibbs.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.869
MAN:
Agent Gibbs, this is dispatch.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.371
Have a DOA in Norfolk.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.706
We've got a body at Norfolk.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.274
Get Ducky.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.709
I thought he was
flying to London.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.611
Plane doesn't leave
for a few hours.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.546
Do you believe
in karma, boss?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.681
I've had three wives, DiNozzo.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.357
Should have driven back.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.292
Driven back where?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.627
( angry grunt )

02:46.667 --> 02:48.369
Who found the body,
Commander?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.704
Those two seamen off
the George Washington.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.306
She docked yesterday,
after a six-month

02:52.340 --> 02:53.674
deployment in the Gulf.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.377
They were driving off station
for two weeks leave.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.611
Stopped to use the head.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.513
That what they call
bleachers in Norfolk?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.715
The one over there
was locked.

03:02.783 --> 03:07.488
Yeah, well, I guess I'd go
out behind the bleachers, too.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.525
After discovering the body,

03:11.559 --> 03:12.960
they flagged down
Petty Officer Cluxton,

03:12.993 --> 03:15.729
who was passing by
on patrol.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.298
You do all this,
Petty Officer?

03:17.331 --> 03:18.266
Yes, ma'am.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.000
After ascertaining
the Lieutenant was deceased

03:20.033 --> 03:21.001
I searched for I.D.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.236
You touched the body?

03:22.270 --> 03:24.238
I was wearing gloves, sir.

03:24.272 --> 03:24.838
Go on.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.839
Finding no I.D.,

03:25.873 --> 03:26.740
I radioed in the report,

03:26.774 --> 03:29.343
retraced my steps,
marked my footprints

03:29.377 --> 03:31.579
for exclusionary purposes,
and taped off

03:31.612 --> 03:32.746
a 20-yard perimeter.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.548
How often did your patrol

03:34.582 --> 03:36.250
take you past this area
last night?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.685
Every hour on the 30, sir.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.586
From?

03:38.619 --> 03:39.820
20-hundred hours when I
came on duty, sir.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.989
Saw nothing unusual

03:42.022 --> 03:44.425
until Seamen Jennings
and Wilkens

03:44.458 --> 03:46.927
flagged me down at 0132.
DiNozzo, get
their statements.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.729
On it, boss.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.365
I took their statements, sir.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.500
You mind if we take them, too?

03:52.533 --> 03:54.468
No, sir. Of course not.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
You did a good job,
Petty Officer.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.772
Thank you, ma'am.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.608
Petty Officer Cluxton.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.477
Agent McGee.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.978
Hey, how... how...
how have you been?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.347
I've been good.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.515
You?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.417
Uh, McGee?
Good, good...

04:09.450 --> 04:10.651
Sorry, Kate.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.985
Yeah, good.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.987
Uh, um... yeah, I've been
assigned

04:14.021 --> 04:16.490
to NCIS headquarters
at the Navy Yard.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.326
So I heard.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.793
It was kind
of a surprise transfer.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.729
Uh, you know, one minute
I'm in Norfolk,

04:21.762 --> 04:22.630
the next...

04:22.663 --> 04:24.298
You're back at Norfolk--

04:24.332 --> 04:25.933
maybe even permanently, McGee.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.969
Yeah, uh...
sorry, sorry, boss.

04:29.002 --> 04:29.970
The Petty Officer

04:30.003 --> 04:30.971
and I, we... vetted

04:31.004 --> 04:32.540
civilian job
applicants back...

04:34.041 --> 04:36.344
I'm going to start
measuring and sketching now.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.811
Yeah, McGee, you do that.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.814
That will be all for now,
Petty Officer.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.683
Yes, sir.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.852
If you need me,
Special Agent Gibbs,

04:44.885 --> 04:46.587
I'll be in my office.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.821
Okay.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.025
You could have told her, Gibbs.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.727
Told who what?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.563
Petty Officer Cluxton.
She did a good job.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.697
Did she now?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.333
She wore gloves,
marked her footprints,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.435
cordoned of the crime scene...

05:01.469 --> 05:02.736
Searched the body for I.D.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.540
How do you do that
without disturbing
the body, Agent Todd?

05:07.975 --> 05:11.579
She could have... should have
waited for the M.E.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.747
That would have been
doing a good job.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.383
Keep shooting.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.586
( sighs )

05:22.523 --> 05:24.925
Dr. Gutterman will be filling in
in my absence.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.894
I should warn you,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.896
the old boy does love
to hear himself talk.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.831
I'll do my best
to handle, Doctor.

05:30.864 --> 05:34.034
Yes, I suspect the good doctor
will be a tad grumpy as well.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.068
Why is that?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.904
He lost the coin toss.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.406
What coin toss, Ducky?

05:38.439 --> 05:39.740
( chuckles )

05:39.773 --> 05:43.477
The one that, in two hours,
will send me to London,

05:43.511 --> 05:44.712
to the assembly of

05:44.745 --> 05:46.747
the Collegium
Mortum Scrutinium.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.782
Of course.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.518
The Society
of Medical Examiners.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.485
Very good, Kate.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.854
Four years of Latin
has finally paid off.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.723
Do you know who
founded the society?

05:55.756 --> 05:56.890
Not a clue.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.826
Leonardo Da Vinci himself.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.927
Wow!

05:59.960 --> 06:00.861
Wow, indeed.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.431
Yes, we can trace
the roots of our society,

06:03.464 --> 06:06.734
dedicated to the history
of forensic sciences,

06:06.767 --> 06:09.537
to one formed by Leonardo
in the same year

06:09.570 --> 06:10.671
that he began the Mona Lisa.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.973
In fact, that transcendent
painting is the symbol...

06:13.006 --> 06:15.776
GIBBS:
Duck, you want to meet
with your society in London,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.045
or give us a lecture?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.780
Ooh, quite right.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.882
I do have a plane to catch.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.617
Thank you, Jethro.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.652
De nada.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.920
Now, what story do you

06:26.954 --> 06:29.557
have to tell us, my dear?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.761
You know, Ducky, someday,
one of them will talk back.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.895
The language
of silence

06:34.928 --> 06:36.464
may be hard to hear, Caitlin,

06:36.497 --> 06:38.131
but, unlike the living,

06:38.165 --> 06:41.201
when the dead speak,
they do not lie.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.770
Small abrasions

06:42.803 --> 06:45.939
and visible bruising
of the neck.

06:45.973 --> 06:46.940
Strangled?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.175
Most likely.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.843
Dr. Gutterman
can confirm that

06:49.877 --> 06:51.545
when he examines
the soft tissues.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.582
Bruises on the thighs.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.083
She could
have been raped.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.785
Gutterman can confirm that, too.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.919
Liver probe.

06:58.952 --> 06:59.987
Ready.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.926
Usually, you ask, Jethro.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.695
Master-Of-Arms

07:07.728 --> 07:09.196
already searched the body, Duck.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.531
I'm double-checking.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.132
I do wish they'd wait
until I arrive.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.567
Hey, boss,
got statements

07:13.601 --> 07:15.102
from Seamen Jennings
and Wilkens.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.103
Can I cut them loose?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.204
They've been at sea
a long time.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.472
Know where to find them?

07:18.506 --> 07:19.573
Motel at Virginia Beach.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.709
Girlfriends are waiting.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.844
Yeah. Let 'em go.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.713
( whistles )

07:25.746 --> 07:28.682
Haven't been with
their women in...

07:28.716 --> 07:31.184
six months, three weeks,

07:31.218 --> 07:32.486
18 hours.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.654
( shudders )

07:33.687 --> 07:35.589
The longest I went was

07:35.623 --> 07:36.957
11 days, six hours.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.127
I can't believe you actually
know these things.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.862
It's a gift.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.935
Liver temp: 81.6.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.938
Ambient temperature:
73.1.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.939
Time of death?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.575
Uh, somewhere
between 2300

07:54.608 --> 07:56.109
and 0100.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.278
Well, my children,

07:58.311 --> 07:59.179
I have a plane to catch.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.914
How long are you
in London for, Ducky?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.950
Only three days.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.885
Actually, I won't be in London.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.654
I'll be in
the city of London.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.855
There's a difference?

08:07.888 --> 08:09.623
DUCKY:
There's a little known fact

08:09.657 --> 08:12.826
that the city of London
isn't actually London at all.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.028
How can it not be London?

08:15.062 --> 08:16.096
( chuckles )

08:16.129 --> 08:17.965
GIBBS:
No, I.D.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.567
We've got a Lieutenant Jane Doe.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.916
The moment Special Agent Gibbs
is done processing the scene,

08:35.949 --> 08:37.918
we get her back to the morgue.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.853
Of course, Doctor.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.057
Ducky, if it's not London,
what is it?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.964
Shouldn't you be on
a plane by now, Doctor?

08:50.998 --> 08:54.234
One of the modern marvels
of air travel, Mr. Palmer--

08:54.267 --> 08:57.004
miss one flight,
there are numerous others

08:57.037 --> 08:58.105
from which to choose.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.740
You started without me.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.042
I believe, as you are
my assistant,

09:02.075 --> 09:04.845
as opposed to the
other way around,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.915
it is my prerogative
to start without you.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.117
( phone ringing )

09:12.019 --> 09:12.953
Abby here.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.087
You're on the air.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.956
Abby, it's Ducky.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.659
Oh, Ducky on the AirFone.
How cool.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.727
I'm in Autopsy.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.095
Then you're going to be way late
for afternoon tea.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.065
I'm sending Mr. Palmer up
with the victim's fingerprints,

09:25.098 --> 09:27.100
semen and blood,
for DNA analysis.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.069
Ooh. Raped and murdered.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.772
Be sure to sign
the evidence exchange forms.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.906
I will check.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.107
Okay.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.010
As soon as I'm finished with
this explosive swab analysis

09:37.044 --> 09:38.111
I will get all over it.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.081
No, you will get
all over it now.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.616
Whoa.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.987
Why are you still here?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.189
I-I'm not.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.944
You're back, aren't you?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.013
You bastard.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.921
That good for you?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.990
Trust me, Mr. Goodwrench,
I'm smiling.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.725
I'm not.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.926
Hey, Gibbs.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.327
( head bangs on desk )

10:29.930 --> 10:31.064
Hey, boss.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.400
Special Agent Goodwrench?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.937
McGee is rewiring my hot box.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.675
That's a nickname for
a bundle of receptors
in the firewall

10:41.709 --> 10:43.043
that regulates

10:43.076 --> 10:44.945
the flow of energy
throughout the system.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.413
See, when stimulated correctly

10:46.446 --> 10:49.082
it sends out waves and waves
of rhythmic pulses.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.818
Waves that, uh...

10:50.851 --> 10:52.252
that hyper-crank

10:52.285 --> 10:56.256
the transfer speed
of digitized infor...

10:56.289 --> 10:58.325
Abby.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.193
McGee is helping me
speed up the search

11:00.227 --> 11:01.995
for Lieutenant Jane Doe's
fingerprints

11:02.029 --> 11:03.063
in the AFIS database.

11:03.096 --> 11:06.466
I got to I.D. her fast,
to keep their hound at bay.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.201
I'm more
Jack Russell Terrier.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.170
No, not you, Gibbs. Ducky.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.105
He's barking at my heels
like a dog with the mange.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.173
He's still here?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.274
He's in autopsy.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.075
And he's so grouchy

11:15.108 --> 11:17.277
he'll give you
a run for your money.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.448
If I said that to Gibbs,
I would be seeing stars.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.151
Well, that's the
advantage of being me.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.452
Now get back down there.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.094
Dr. Mallard?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.796
Jimmy Palmer.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.198
Oh... how stupid is that?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.167
I know that you know
I'm not Dr. Mallard.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.302
I just...
because he... uh...

11:42.335 --> 11:45.138
He's not here, sir.

11:45.172 --> 11:45.973
He catch a flight to England?

11:46.006 --> 11:48.108
No, he said he was going
to Norfolk.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.142
I think he drove.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.043
Why?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.044
Why'd he drive?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.045
Go to Norfolk.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.814
Oh. Uh...
he didn't say.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.750
He just finished the autopsy,
told me to put her to bed

11:56.784 --> 11:58.886
and then he said
he was going to Norfolk.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.520
Anything unusual in the autopsy?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.189
I don't know, sir.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.024
Dr. Mallard wouldn't even
let me assist him.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.458
He did everything by himself.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.961
He ever do that before?

12:07.995 --> 12:08.996
No, sir.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.997
He took quite a while, too.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.099
He wanted to check
everything over and over.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.234
I thought he only made
me do that 'cause I'm...

12:15.468 --> 12:17.170
...inexperienced.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.239
Sheesh!
I've seen that look before.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.908
You went to the men's room
45 minutes ago.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.209
You clocked me?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.244
What could take you
so long?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.478
Don't answer that.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.479
Actually, Kate, I was...

12:59.512 --> 13:00.613
I don't want to hear it!

13:00.647 --> 13:03.216
...returning the buck
eighty-five to the drive-thru.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.519
You returned the money?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.856
See, the whole hands over
the ears thing doesn't work.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.957
I used to do that
when I was a kid

13:09.990 --> 13:11.091
I could hear everything
my parents said.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.160
They had some interesting words.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.195
I can't believe
you gave it back.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.430
Well, she was off duty.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.365
You didn't give it back.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.367
The pimply-faced mall rat
at the drive-thru

13:20.400 --> 13:22.269
would've just pocketed it.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.904
You brought
the teacher coffee?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.105
Thinking ahead, Kate.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.406
Thinking ahead.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.075
After you tell Gibbs
we've got nothing,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.143
a cup of his favorite brew
will tame the beast.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.912
After I tell Gibbs?

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
Tell me what?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.882
Hey, boss.
I got you a little...

13:34.915 --> 13:36.249
Hot, hot, hot, hot...

13:36.283 --> 13:38.585
Aah...!

13:38.618 --> 13:40.253
( chuckling )

13:40.287 --> 13:42.422
What are the odds
of that happening

13:42.455 --> 13:43.991
twice in one day?

13:44.024 --> 13:44.958
GIBBS:
The same as me

13:44.992 --> 13:48.195
firing the two of you
if I don't get a report.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.196
( clears throat )

13:49.229 --> 13:50.197
The victim's picture

13:50.230 --> 13:51.398
is on the Navy Intranet

13:51.431 --> 13:54.367
to department heads of every
in-station vessel and base unit.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.602
Nothing yet.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.371
PSA?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.140
No missing females.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.242
Officers or enlisted.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.245
PSA is
Personnel Support Activity.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.047
I've been here a year, Tony.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.215
I know the acronyms.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.216
Ah, a year.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.284
Seems like only yesterday
you were mixing up

14:11.318 --> 14:13.053
NAV-SOCs with NAV-SUPs.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.087
( groans )

14:14.121 --> 14:16.990
Our little girl's growing up
fast, isn't she, boss?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.060
What was that for?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.061
Not growing up.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.062
What else you got?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.230
Nothing.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.331
Nothing.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.366
ABBY:
Hey, guys.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.235
But it looks like Abby does.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.169
Who is our victim?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.238
We do not know.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.240
Then what are you doing here?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.575
We're... we're...
we're through, boss.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.478
We ran the entire
AFIS data bank,

14:38.511 --> 14:39.646
we didn't get a match.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.381
How can AFIS
not find a match?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.549
She's a Navy lieutenant.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.551
DUCKY:
No, she isn't, Jethro.

14:44.584 --> 14:48.922
Lieutenant Jane Doe
is a misnomer.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.093
The poor woman was never
in the Navy.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.096
Match this sperm

14:56.129 --> 14:58.898
against the sample
I removed from our victim.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.170
Please.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.677
You've been holding out
on me, Doctor.

15:10.710 --> 15:16.316
Yes, Agent Gibbs...

15:16.349 --> 15:18.285
I have.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.308
Tell my family
what happened to me.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.144
Please.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.113
GIBBS:
Dr. Mallard.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.468
That's not the first
trident you've seen

16:08.501 --> 16:10.337
carved in the neck
of a victim, is it?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.039
No.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.706
I shouldn't have
held out on you,

16:13.740 --> 16:17.310
but I wasn't sure it was the
same until I did the autopsy.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.280
You weren't sure when you saw
the trident on her neck

16:20.313 --> 16:22.415
at the crime scene?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.216
Unlike you, Agent Gibbs,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.618
I prefer to rely
on forensic evidence

16:25.652 --> 16:26.719
and not my gut.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.455
We're a team, Doctor.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.024
Team members don't hold out.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.394
Yes, you're right.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.429
It was... unprofessional.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.765
I'm still hoping that
Abby doesn't get a match

16:38.798 --> 16:42.502
and all this is just
some macabre coincidence.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.374
Forgive me, Jethro.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.214
Tell me about
that other case.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.249
Well, it was
ten years ago...

16:56.283 --> 16:58.385
A Navy corpsman, out jogging,

16:58.418 --> 16:59.686
found a body in a culvert

16:59.719 --> 17:02.189
beside an athletic field
at Norfolk--

17:02.222 --> 17:06.326
a Navy lieutenant who'd been
raped and strangled.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.062
She had a trident carved
on the side of her neck.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.399
We ran her prints through AFIS
and got nothing.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.567
She wasn't in the Navy.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.637
Our profiler believed
that the murderer

17:17.670 --> 17:19.706
had dressed his victim
as a Navy lieutenant

17:19.739 --> 17:23.376
to fulfill some
revenge fantasy.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.746
'94 was the first year women
were deployed on combat ships.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.449
Yes, Special Agent Dawes and I
assumed that the killer

17:29.482 --> 17:31.518
had served under
a female officer.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.620
Dawes?

17:33.653 --> 17:35.855
I don't know him.
He retire?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.825
Uh-uh. He passed on,
oh... seven years ago.

17:38.858 --> 17:42.162
He investigated every Navy unit
with a trident insignia.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.863
Especially those
with female officers.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.665
He didn't come up
with a single suspect.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.135
The trident symbol may have
nothing to do with the Navy.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.370
That's the conclusion
we came to. But...

17:50.403 --> 17:54.374
this note was found
at the scene of the crime,

17:54.407 --> 17:57.744
three days after the body
was discovered.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.412
Missed it on
the initial search?

17:59.446 --> 18:00.213
No.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.216
It was found where
the body had been.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.219
But he didn't come back.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.788
Not until now.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.525
I've got one question
for you, Ducky.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.494
Why is this case so personal?

18:19.366 --> 18:21.501
Did you know that
Leonardo Da Vinci

18:21.534 --> 18:23.503
never gave the Mona Lisa

18:23.536 --> 18:26.339
to the patron
who commissioned it?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.640
Nope.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.644
Instead... he carried
the painting with him

18:31.678 --> 18:35.282
for the rest of his life.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.751
She's been with me
for ten years, Jethro.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.854
She was the only Jane Doe
I never identified.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.725
The only one whose family
has no closure.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.929
The only one
who never went home.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.166
( phone ringing )

18:59.606 --> 19:00.773
Autopsy.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.509
ABBY:
Ducky?
Do I sound like Ducky?

19:02.542 --> 19:05.778
No. Actually, these days
he sounds more like you, Gibbs.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.913
I'm not in the mood, Abbs.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.781
Well, maybe this will brighten

19:08.815 --> 19:09.916
your spirits.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.619
The semen sample
from Jane Doe's murderer

19:12.652 --> 19:15.488
matches the sample
that Ducky gave me.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.459
This is good news, right?

19:19.492 --> 19:22.762
Abbs, that semen is from
a ten-year-old cold case.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.702
He's back, isn't he?

19:29.736 --> 19:32.639
Not again, Jethro.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.442
We can't let him
escape again.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.283
DUCKY:
I saw this trident

19:43.316 --> 19:45.418
carved into the neck
of the victim

19:45.452 --> 19:49.289
at the crime scene
and told no one.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.558
Not even Gibbs.

19:51.591 --> 19:55.528
All I can do is apologize
and assure you

19:55.562 --> 19:58.431
that such an inexcusable lapse
of forensic protocol

19:58.465 --> 20:01.000
will never happen again.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.436
Right.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.839
Ten years ago, another Jane Doe

20:06.873 --> 20:09.409
was found raped and strangled
in a culvert

20:09.442 --> 20:11.478
beside an athletic field
at Norfolk.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.746
She, too, was a civilian,

20:13.780 --> 20:16.649
dressed in the uniform
of a naval lieutenant.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.918
She had a high
blood-alcohol level

20:18.951 --> 20:22.489
and a trident carved
into the side of her neck.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.590
Abby has confirmed

20:23.623 --> 20:28.661
that sperm from both victims
came from the same man,

20:28.695 --> 20:32.965
so we are pursuing
a serial rapist and murderer.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.869
GIBBS:
This note was found three days

20:36.903 --> 20:38.805
after the crime scene
had been processed.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.340
A challenge
to investigators.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.441
You think, Kate?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.909
I've asked Commander Reynolds

20:42.942 --> 20:45.778
to place our crime scene
under discreet surveillance.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.614
Since '94 was the first year

20:47.647 --> 20:48.848
we deployed women on warships,

20:48.881 --> 20:51.384
this wacko may be
an enlisted man

20:51.418 --> 20:52.852
acting out a revenge fantasy.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.355
They investigate units with
tridents on their patches?

20:55.388 --> 20:58.825
Gee, I don't think
they thought about that, Tony.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.393
Yeah.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.462
They investigated every
ship and shore division

21:02.495 --> 21:03.796
with female officers.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.398
Nada.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.036
Abbs, you need to go
to the head?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.638
No. I have a question.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.307
Isn't ten years a long time
between murders?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.675
Absolutely.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.545
This doesn't fit
a serial killer's profile.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.947
Ducky, could pull the headshots
up for me again, please?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.983
Now if he goes
through the trouble

21:24.016 --> 21:26.553
of dressing two civilians
like a lieutenant he hates,

21:26.586 --> 21:27.887
why is one blonde

21:27.920 --> 21:29.088
the other brunette?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.023
One Anglo, one Hispanic?

21:31.057 --> 21:32.925
They're both cute
for being dead.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.461
GIBBS:
He's a wacko!

21:34.494 --> 21:35.762
Maybe just being female

21:35.795 --> 21:37.797
and intoxicated was good enough.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.932
Unless Abby blew
the sperm match...

21:39.966 --> 21:41.067
No way.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.769
...the same man killed
both of them.

21:42.802 --> 21:47.740
Which means he didn't rape and
murder for ten years because...

21:47.774 --> 21:50.042
He was in prison!
He was in prison!

21:50.076 --> 21:51.378
GIBBS:
Hey...

21:52.879 --> 21:54.947
Okay, homework assignments:
McGee--

21:54.981 --> 21:56.082
Boss.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.884
Search JAG records
for sailors incarcerated

21:57.917 --> 21:59.919
after October of '94.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.853
And recently released.
On it.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.855
Kate, suspect interviews
from ten years ago.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.991
If any of these men
still live

22:05.024 --> 22:06.893
in Norfolk,
question them.

22:06.926 --> 22:07.827
Okay.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.695
DiNozzo,

22:08.728 --> 22:09.962
flash this Jane Doe

22:09.996 --> 22:11.431
at every bar, club
and strip joint

22:11.464 --> 22:13.400
within a mile
of the Norfolk Gate.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.867
Given the victim's
blood-alcohol level,

22:14.901 --> 22:16.068
maybe he picked her up
at one of them.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.870
No problema.

22:17.904 --> 22:18.771
Abby, forensics
may have

22:18.805 --> 22:20.607
missed something in '94.
Go over it again.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.874
Yes, Professor.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.576
Come on, people.
Let's go! Let's go!

22:23.610 --> 22:24.944
Hey, wait.
Come here.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.713
You'll need Ducky's help.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.115
No, I won't.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.918
Abbs...

22:35.622 --> 22:37.690
Yes, I will.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.692
Hey, uh, Duckman...

22:39.726 --> 22:40.727
Yeah.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.729
The cross polars

22:42.762 --> 22:45.632
in my polarizing
light microscope
won't center.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.899
You may have a problem.

22:46.933 --> 22:47.700
Yeah.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.602
However, I think
I have the solution.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.642
Hey.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.478
How's NCIS doing?

22:58.511 --> 22:59.879
Well, according
to my friends,

22:59.912 --> 23:01.013
I'm having some bad karma.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.783
Not that I really believe in
that stuff, but... you know.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.118
You really should, you know.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.987
That right?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.989
Yeah.
See, I used to reject

23:10.022 --> 23:13.726
all things spiritual,
mystical and existential

23:13.760 --> 23:15.695
But once I began
to embrace them,

23:15.728 --> 23:18.865
my whole life
started to blossom.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.067
She been in recently?

23:21.100 --> 23:24.737
No. What'd she do?

23:24.771 --> 23:26.773
Got herself raped
and killed.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.677
Such a sweet countenance.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.745
"Sweet countenance..."

23:32.779 --> 23:35.147
Yeah, that radiant look
on her face.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.750
She doesn't look
radiant-- she's dead.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.951
In that picture?

23:38.985 --> 23:39.986
Yeah, she's dead.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.053
She's dead?

23:41.087 --> 23:41.854
She's dead.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.856
Why do you think
her eyes are closed?

23:43.890 --> 23:46.192
I thought she was meditating.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.164
Okay, thanks.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.736
Guess he doesn't believe
in that, either.

24:03.075 --> 24:06.479
GIBBS:
Well, have Petty Officer
Cluxton deliver it ASAP.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.947
MAN:
I'll put it in the overnight
for you.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.217
No. The evening pouch
will not do, Commander!

24:11.250 --> 24:12.752
He didn't wait three days.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.953
ABBY:
Hello.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.988
Abbs, Norfolk got a note
from our wacko.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.023
Ooh, did you catch him?

24:17.056 --> 24:18.124
He made the drop before

24:18.157 --> 24:19.091
surveillance was in place.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.993
You-/////!ll have it
in a couple of hours.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.730
Listen. Compare the ink,
the paper,

24:23.763 --> 24:24.597
the handwriting.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.598
Did you get DNA?

24:25.632 --> 24:27.099
You get DNA off the first note?

24:27.133 --> 24:30.269
Yep. DNA testing was in
the caveman era in '94.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.838
I'm good.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.208
I'm really good.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.513
Gas pain?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.749
What?

24:42.782 --> 24:43.315
No!

24:43.349 --> 24:44.884
Well, then stop grinning

24:44.917 --> 24:46.152
and tell me what you got.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.788
When he found the first
Jane Doe while jogging,

24:48.821 --> 24:50.690
Petty Officer Goetz was in port
on a carrier,

24:50.723 --> 24:51.824
the Teddy Roosevelt.

24:51.858 --> 24:56.996
Really? Agent Dawes interrogated
him a number of times

24:57.029 --> 24:58.998
on the Big Stick and here.

24:59.031 --> 24:59.999
Big Stick?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.167
Teddy Roosevelt.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.169
"Talk softly, carry a...

25:03.202 --> 25:04.971
Carry a big stick. Cute.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.041
Goetz stayed in the
Navy, is a chief

25:09.075 --> 25:10.843
and arrived in Norfolk
on the same carrier

25:10.877 --> 25:12.244
as the seamen
who found our Jane Doe.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.647
Uh, the "Honest Abe."

25:14.681 --> 25:15.982
"Shall Not Perish."

25:16.015 --> 25:17.650
What?

25:17.684 --> 25:19.552
The Lincoln not
the "Honest Abe."

25:19.586 --> 25:20.920
It's "Shall Not Perish."

25:20.953 --> 25:23.189
What kind of a nickname
is "Shall Not Perish"?

25:23.222 --> 25:26.693
Ask Chief Goetz when you
pull him in for questioning.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.293
Okay.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.795
The Emancipator.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.766
That, that would be a good
name for the Abraham Lincoln.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.267
Since he, uh,

25:35.301 --> 25:39.338
he signed the
Emancipation Proclamation.

25:39.371 --> 25:43.142
Uh, the... Sorry.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.644
This have to do with the body

25:44.677 --> 25:45.945
I found ten years ago, sir?

25:45.978 --> 25:46.813
Yeah.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.181
Isn't there a statute
of limitations

25:49.215 --> 25:51.150
on questioning a suspect?

25:51.183 --> 25:52.785
Didn't say you
were a suspect.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.787
Why else would I be here, sir?

25:54.821 --> 25:57.056
Another body was found
two nights ago.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.591
Same MO.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.996
She have a trident... here?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.700
He said he'd be back.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.101
Now, how did you know that?

26:09.135 --> 26:11.704
Agent Dawes never told you.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.571
No, sir.

26:12.605 --> 26:15.174
But he had me write out
"I'll be back"

26:15.207 --> 26:17.076
with my right and left hand.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.011
Not too hard to figure out why.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.285
You arrived two days ago
on the Abraham Lincoln?

26:26.318 --> 26:27.286
Yes, sir.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.288
First night back,
where'd you go?

26:30.857 --> 26:32.625
You think I raped
and murdered her?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.160
Never said she was raped.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.361
You said the same MO.

26:35.394 --> 26:38.898
Where'd you spend
your first night ashore?

26:43.836 --> 26:44.871
Clubbing?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.305
I didn't leave the station.

26:46.338 --> 26:50.943
Six months at sea,
your first night in port

26:50.977 --> 26:54.280
you spend it
aboard ship?

26:55.682 --> 26:56.683
No, sir.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.284
I said I didn't leave
the station.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.155
I stayed with a friend.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.356
Stationed here
at Norfolk?

27:04.390 --> 27:05.925
Yes, sir.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.194
Hey.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.896
Hey! Whoa. Whoa!

27:09.929 --> 27:11.230
Where's the five-alarm?

27:11.263 --> 27:12.699
I think I have a suspect.

27:12.732 --> 27:13.966
Machinist Mate Harlan Wilson.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.201
He was there in October '94.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.368
Discharged that December.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.304
Arrested two months
later in Toronto

27:18.337 --> 27:19.038
for sexually assaulting

27:19.071 --> 27:20.973
a female Canadian
naval officer.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.875
Got 15 years.
Paroled two months ago

27:22.909 --> 27:24.276
and is now living
in Norfolk.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.145
I didn't know
there were women
in the Canadian Navy.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.780
I gotta tell Gibbs.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.348
Whoa, probie, first, you report
to your immediate superior.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.283
I just did.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.185
"Blah-blah-blah-blah,
female Canadian naval officer."

27:33.219 --> 27:34.253
That's not reporting.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.755
Yeah, that would be
all you heard.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.156
Again, start
with the name.
Can't do that, sir.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.159
Your friend married?

27:40.192 --> 27:42.061
No, sir.
An officer?

27:44.363 --> 27:45.798
Yes, sir.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.266
So, you see how
I can't give you
the name.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.334
Chief,

27:48.367 --> 27:51.337
I'm not interested
in ruining careers.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.204
I need to know

27:52.238 --> 27:56.208
where you spent
the night of the murder.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.217
Can we speak
off the record, sir?

28:05.251 --> 28:07.086
Just you and me?

28:10.289 --> 28:12.324
Kate...

28:12.358 --> 28:13.826
stop the tape.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.264
Stop the tape.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.298
Yes, ma'am.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.503
TONY:
No sound?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.437
Gibbs is having

28:25.471 --> 28:27.740
a private interrogation:
no sound, no video.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.009
McGee needs to talk to him.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.344
I'm not going
to interrupt him.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.246
Kate...

28:34.280 --> 28:35.447
( wry laugh )

28:35.481 --> 28:36.849
No.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.384
Okay. Fill her in, McGee.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.119
Tell her about
Harlan Wilson.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.788
Meet me in the
garage in five.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.157
I'm waiting, Chief.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.392
How do I know
they stopped taping?

28:46.425 --> 28:48.427
Because I told them to.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.896
The name.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.069
Lieutenant Commander...

28:59.438 --> 29:01.808
William McDougal.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.548
Hey, Starsky, check

29:09.581 --> 29:11.350
the sweet '70's ride.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.152
Nice.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.821
All right, you be
the Avon Lady.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.255
I'll cover the rear.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.124
Yah.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.901
What's the peekie, probie?

29:28.935 --> 29:30.336
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.403
I'd love to get
a look inside

29:31.437 --> 29:32.371
while he's away.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.340
I told you we should get
search authorization.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.008
No time.
Besides it's a Catch-22.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.209
It is?

29:37.243 --> 29:38.410
Yeah. We go inside
and get something

29:38.444 --> 29:39.545
we shouldn't,
we're screwed.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.313
We don't go inside and don't get
something we could've,

29:41.347 --> 29:43.515
we're more screwed.
I'm not following.

29:43.549 --> 29:47.453
That's because I'm a highly
seasoned senior field agent

29:47.486 --> 29:50.222
and you're a pathetic...
Probie. Yeah.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.091
You're a fast study, McGee.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.994
15 seconds--
personal best.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.967
Harlan's no Martha Stewart.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.379
Well, he's gonna be home soon.

30:13.412 --> 30:13.946
How can you tell?

30:13.980 --> 30:16.515
Hungry Man in the oven.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.155
Buck eighty-freakin'-five.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.330
( car approaching )

30:33.299 --> 30:34.533
Pickup's pulling up!

30:35.601 --> 30:36.936
( grunts )

30:47.279 --> 30:48.514
( dog barking in distance )

30:52.118 --> 30:53.920
Yeah?
NCIS.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.657
Harlan Wilson?

30:58.690 --> 31:02.094
Tom Wilson-- his big brother.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.329
Your kid brother
around, Tom?

31:04.496 --> 31:05.864
No.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.502
He listed this address
on his parole release.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.272
He wa here.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.473
You know where he is now?

31:14.506 --> 31:16.408
Yeah.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.377
Well, we need to talk to him.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.212
Well, that's gonna be hard
to do.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.448
He's been dead for six weeks.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.395
Chief Goetz's alibi checks out.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.164
Where was he?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.465
With a friend.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.167
You're taking the word
of a friend?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.468
No,

31:42.501 --> 31:44.336
a saliva swab

31:44.370 --> 31:45.704
to compare his DNA with sperm

31:45.737 --> 31:48.374
taken from the victim's.
Any other questions?

31:48.407 --> 31:49.375
Good. My turn.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.176
Where's McGee?

31:50.209 --> 31:52.044
He took Harlan's hairbrush
to Abby

31:52.078 --> 31:53.379
to compare his DNA
to the sperm.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.214
Probie won't give up
on the obvious.

31:55.247 --> 31:55.948
Harlan Wilson was dead

31:55.982 --> 31:57.216
when the
second murder occurred,

31:57.249 --> 31:58.617
wasn't he, DiNozzo?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.619
Very dead, boss.
Big mother heart attack.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.254
Fax of the death certificate.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.024
How many bars and clubs
did you canvass?

32:05.057 --> 32:06.425
Uh, 24, 25.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.493
Which was it?

32:07.526 --> 32:08.527
24 or 25?!

32:08.560 --> 32:09.395
You in a bad mood, Boss?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.262
No!

32:10.296 --> 32:10.963
Didn't think so.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.298
Covered every one within a mile

32:12.331 --> 32:13.499
of the Norfolk main gate--

32:13.532 --> 32:14.500
like you said.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.402
What about the other gates?

32:16.435 --> 32:19.338
You didn't ask me
to look at...

32:19.371 --> 32:22.174
I'm gonna... I'm on that.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.475
Kate, you go with him.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.977
You want me to go bar-hopping
with Tony?!

32:30.249 --> 32:32.251
You've never been in a bar,
have you?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.120
Not the kind sailors hang at.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.225
Agent Gibbs?

32:39.258 --> 32:41.093
You can catch him
at the rear elevator.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.263
Agent Gibbs.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.565
You have the note,
Petty Officer?

32:46.598 --> 32:48.000
I do, sir.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.769
Knowing how important
the note is forensically,

32:50.802 --> 32:53.772
I jumped a ride with a CH-53
that was headed to Quantico,

32:53.805 --> 32:58.010
caught the Amtrak to D.C.,
then hailed a cab.

32:58.044 --> 33:00.512
Well, that's creative thinking,
Petty Officer Cluxton.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.348
Thank you, sir.
Are you taking

33:02.381 --> 33:03.549
the note to the lab now?

33:03.582 --> 33:05.484
I'm...

33:05.517 --> 33:07.719
pretty interested
in forensics, sir.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.628
KATE:
Tell me you're not serious
about the last place.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.664
Completely serious, Kate.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.666
I mean, strip clubs
are good for more than

33:20.699 --> 33:23.669
just fraternity bashes
and bachelor parties.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.172
You honestly think
bar mitzvahs are appropriate.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.439
Oh, trust me.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.408
Nothing says
"welcome to manhood"

33:29.441 --> 33:32.111
as perfectly as
a skillful lap dance.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.445
Speaking of...

33:33.479 --> 33:34.480
Hello.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.415
We don't open until 6:00.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.817
And you're working here
instead of catching rays

33:38.850 --> 33:41.220
at the beach in a thong.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.322
I know it's cold out,

33:43.355 --> 33:44.390
probably too cold.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.691
You do wear a thong,
don't you?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.393
Tony...

33:47.426 --> 33:49.395
Sorry.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.829
It's my humor.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.098
Not for everyone.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.365
NCIS.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.333
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service...

33:54.366 --> 33:56.402
Yeah, I know what it means.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.603
What do you want?

33:57.636 --> 33:58.604
Tony...

33:58.637 --> 33:59.605
Well...

33:59.638 --> 34:00.739
Tony.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.475
What?!

34:03.509 --> 34:06.445
This is the girl playing
the drums, isn't it?

34:07.379 --> 34:10.216
Yeah, she hasn't been here
the last three nights.

34:10.249 --> 34:10.849
What happened to her?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.384
Can you tell us her name?

34:13.385 --> 34:16.155
Janice Santos.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.292
She isn't sleeping,
is she?

34:20.326 --> 34:22.328
Not sleeping.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.296
Oh, my God.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.798
( stifled sob )

34:26.832 --> 34:27.866
We need an address.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.503
What happened to her?

34:33.405 --> 34:35.441
She was raped
and murdered.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.445
Some man

34:39.478 --> 34:41.180
raped and murdered her?

34:41.213 --> 34:42.781
Yeah. It wasn't me.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.450
I'm trying to catch
the bastard.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.152
Sorry.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.487
It's just a shock.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.622
Any ideas who
could've done this?

34:50.656 --> 34:54.726
No. God, no.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.565
Do you have the address?

34:59.598 --> 35:03.135
Yeah, of course.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.470
I'll get it for you.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.174
She took that hard.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.876
Yeah. She sure did.

35:10.909 --> 35:14.513
The writing looks the same
to me, Special Agent McGee.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.550
It's pretty similar,
Petty Officer Cluxton.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.352
There are
slight discrepancies,

35:20.386 --> 35:21.887
within the range that
a person's handwriting

35:21.920 --> 35:23.522
would change in ten years...

35:23.555 --> 35:25.757
Special Agent McGee.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.271
What's this?

35:39.305 --> 35:42.374
Oh, that's a polarizing
light microscope.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.442
Let me show you
how to use it.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.545
You touch that, McGee,
you'll be singing soprano.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.283
Yeah, Abby's under
a lot of pressure.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.720
What are you doing
to the note?

35:54.753 --> 35:57.256
Are you writing a book?

35:57.289 --> 35:58.657
No, I'm just...

35:58.690 --> 36:01.893
interested, ma'am.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.296
Looking for prints.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.301
McGEE:
The fumes are from
heated super glue.

36:09.335 --> 36:12.438
In its gaseous form,
its bonding capabilities

36:12.471 --> 36:15.874
enable us to obtain
fingerprints.

36:15.907 --> 36:16.842
( machine beeps )

36:23.582 --> 36:26.418
( sighs ):
Nothing.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.888
Well...

36:29.921 --> 36:32.224
I'd better get
back to Norfolk.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.925
Thanks for letting
me observe, ma'am.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.961
Anytime. Well...

36:35.994 --> 36:38.564
not anytime... sometime.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.731
Maybe.

36:42.934 --> 36:46.238
Good seeing you again,
Special Agent McGee.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.440
Likewise,
Petty Officer Cluxton.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.680
( machine beeping )

36:55.614 --> 36:56.715
So, are you two that formal

36:56.748 --> 36:58.884
when you're exchanging
bodily fluids?

37:02.020 --> 37:03.422
TONY:
Stay outside, sir.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.913
Did Janice Santos
always keep the place so empty?

37:27.946 --> 37:28.980
I don't know.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.550
No clothes.
No personal effects.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.885
This place has been cleaned.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.554
We better call Gibbs.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.788
( telephone rings )

37:36.822 --> 37:40.559
At least I can tell Duck you've
I.D.'d Jane Doe Number Two.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.328
If her apartment's that clean,

37:42.361 --> 37:44.830
this Janice Santos
probably knew her killer.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.598
When you're finished
with the crime scene,

37:46.632 --> 37:47.766
bring everything back here.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.369
I'll see you at Abby's
in the morning.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.671
ABBY:
DNA processing
can take several days,

37:52.704 --> 37:55.006
but knowing the hyper-urgency
of the case, I processed

37:55.040 --> 37:57.843
all of the sperm samples
in just 37 hours.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.846
Gonna be another 37
before we get some results?

38:00.879 --> 38:02.548
Okay, um...

38:02.581 --> 38:04.716
DNA off the first note
matched the sperm.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.917
The killer wrote it.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.487
The second note?
No prints. No DNA.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.521
What about the handwriting?

38:09.555 --> 38:10.589
It could be a match.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.590
I sent a copy

38:11.623 --> 38:13.659
to an expert I met
at a forensics conference

38:13.692 --> 38:14.693
at the Greenbriar.

38:14.726 --> 38:15.761
It is such a sweet place.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.795
They have golf,
tennis,

38:16.828 --> 38:18.464
falconry...

38:18.497 --> 38:19.431
Falconry!

38:19.465 --> 38:22.501
I hunted with a falcon
in Scotland in my youth.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.403
It's so cool. Yeah.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.372
It's almost a lost art,
I'm afraid.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.474
Like forensics reporting?

38:28.507 --> 38:29.475
( chuckles )

38:29.508 --> 38:30.909
Okay... moving on to saliva,

38:30.942 --> 38:32.644
always a crowd pleaser.

38:32.678 --> 38:36.582
There is no way
Chief Goetz's DNA comes close

38:36.615 --> 38:37.949
to matching the sperm.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.685
I guess you
were right, boss.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.719
You guess?

38:40.752 --> 38:41.553
I know.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.489
Abby, why do you
call us all in here

38:43.522 --> 38:44.790
when you have nothing?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.358
But I do!

38:47.626 --> 38:51.062
I matched the DNA off the hair
from the brush McGee gave me.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.798
Hello, Mr. Wilson?

38:52.831 --> 38:55.767
The DNA matches the sperm
found in both victims.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.038
That's impossible.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.540
Wilson had been
dead weeks

39:01.573 --> 39:02.841
when Janice Santos
was raped.

39:03.909 --> 39:07.112
DNA does not lie.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.747
Hey.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.017
Hey, he died before she did,
boss, I swear.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.084
Boss, what if...

39:13.118 --> 39:14.586
what if Wilson's semen was

39:14.620 --> 39:15.687
inserted in Janice Santos

39:15.721 --> 39:17.055
after she was murdered?

39:17.088 --> 39:18.690
Ew!

39:18.724 --> 39:20.692
How'd the murderer
get the semen?

39:20.726 --> 39:21.727
DUCKY:
Same way I did.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.869
Looking at the time code,

39:30.902 --> 39:32.704
this is the day
before the murder.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.415
What is it, McGee?

39:43.449 --> 39:44.850
She's the one.

39:44.883 --> 39:45.684
Well, how
can you tell?

39:45.717 --> 39:46.752
She's not even near
the refrigerator.

39:46.785 --> 39:47.619
His gut.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.822
No, no, no,
it's not just my gut, boss.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.158
When I was back
at Norfolk, Cynthia...

39:53.191 --> 39:55.727
Petty Officer Cluxton
and I, we were friendly.

39:55.761 --> 39:56.728
Really!

39:56.762 --> 39:57.829
Abby...

39:57.863 --> 39:58.897
She liked me,

39:58.930 --> 40:00.198
but not that way.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.769
What way would
that be, probie?

40:03.802 --> 40:06.838
I didn't ask, Tony,
and she didn't tell.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.575
Cluxton's gay?

40:09.608 --> 40:11.142
Boss, we I.D.'d
Janice Santos

40:11.176 --> 40:12.511
in a lesbian bar.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.045
There's more.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.747
Petty Officer Cluxton used

40:15.781 --> 40:16.682
her mother's name.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.651
Her father was an NCIS Agent
before he died.

40:19.685 --> 40:20.652
Special Agent Dawes.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.721
TONY:
Boss, I didn't think
about this until...

40:22.754 --> 40:24.656
I think that's her.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.225
That's okay.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.494
Run the tape.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.012
Janice Santos was your lover.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.549
You met her at Flip Side...

40:50.582 --> 40:52.183
a lesbian bar.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.253
Which is why the bartender
didn't respond to me.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.022
CLUXTON:
You accusing me
of being gay, sir?

40:57.055 --> 40:59.157
No. No, I'm accusing you
of murder.

40:59.190 --> 41:02.928
Murder?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.530
I didn't murder anyone, sir.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.765
She jilt you, Petty Officer?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.835
I have no idea what
you're talking about, sir.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.103
It doesn't matter.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.841
We have you on tape removing
semen from a Jane Doe case

41:15.874 --> 41:17.843
your father worked
ten years ago.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.946
Can you identify on that tape
what I'm removing

41:20.979 --> 41:22.748
in the evidence locker, sir?

41:22.781 --> 41:26.752
I can't.

41:26.785 --> 41:27.886
You copied
the killer's M.O.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.521
from your father's
case file.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.990
I'm not sure where my father's
case files are, sir.

41:33.759 --> 41:36.628
You strangled
Janice Santos,

41:36.662 --> 41:37.796
put her in a Navy uniform.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.231
carved a trident
in her neck,

41:40.265 --> 41:42.133
inserted semen
from the first murder

41:42.167 --> 41:43.168
in her vagina.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.704
Not true.

41:45.737 --> 41:46.938
None of it, sir.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.140
Even left a note like the one
found at the first crime scene.

41:49.174 --> 41:52.177
I didn't leave that note,
I found it.

41:52.210 --> 41:57.916
So, who killed Janice Santos?

41:57.949 --> 42:03.321
Obviously, whoever murdered
the Jane Doe ten years ago, sir.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.791
No, not whoever.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.926
His name is Harlan Wilson.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.562
A former machinist's mate
stationed at Norfolk.

42:10.596 --> 42:13.098
You caught him, sir.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.299
No.

42:14.332 --> 42:19.004
No, but we matched his DNA
to semen found in both victims.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.740
Why are you accusing me?

42:22.641 --> 42:24.943
Harlan Wilson died five weeks

42:24.976 --> 42:27.212
before you killed Janice.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.721
Damn...

42:35.754 --> 42:36.988
damn...

42:37.022 --> 42:38.957
damn!

42:50.001 --> 42:54.005
It's time for our relationship
to change, my dear.

42:54.039 --> 42:55.907
It's time for you to go home,

42:55.941 --> 43:01.613
but it's not the home
you knew in this life.

43:01.647 --> 43:03.849
But I think
you'll find peace here.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.926
And the way things turned out,
so will I.
