WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.551
Korvo, how do you like
living with the boss?

00:09.551 --> 00:11.052
I bet it's like living with a king!

00:11.052 --> 00:14.014
Shut up, Doug. Terry's hashtag
not my boss hashtag.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.306
Let's get that trending.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.766
This is so exciting!

00:16.766 --> 00:17.892
I wonder how he's going to enter.

00:17.892 --> 00:18.977
He's in the box.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.729
Yo, what if he copters in?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.188
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.732
Terry's just gonna jump out from the box,

00:23.732 --> 00:25.025
with the element of surprise being

00:25.025 --> 00:26.401
that he was here the whole time.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.863
Ta-dee!

00:29.863 --> 00:31.031
- Woo!
- Ya!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.782
He didn't even get ta-da right.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.701
Hear ye, hear ye. I called you today

00:34.701 --> 00:36.786
as I haveth a giant annoucement-eth.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.414
As we know, my predecessor Colin Sarner,

00:39.414 --> 00:42.375
may he rest in power, was a total dipshit.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.294
He ran Davenport Rakes into the ground.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.713
We've got, like, 50,000 rakes
just sittin' in the warehouse

00:46.713 --> 00:47.839
sucking their own tits.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.132
If we don't sell them,

00:49.132 --> 00:50.508
this company's fooked.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.260
Come on, Pim!

00:52.260 --> 00:53.678
No breaking the fourth wall.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.889
We can't afford to pay Krasinski
the spoof royalties.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.558
But I have a plan to save us all.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.851
We are gonna get

00:59.851 --> 01:01.811
the Wooden City contract!

01:01.811 --> 01:03.646
- Alright.
- So exciting.

01:03.646 --> 01:04.898
The Wooden City is

01:04.898 --> 01:07.692
the most raked city in the world.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.652
Everybody who lives there
is all trees and shit.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.113
All I have to do is charm
their comptroller,

01:12.113 --> 01:13.656
the man who makes all the big decisions,

01:13.656 --> 01:15.158
and fuckin' boom,

01:15.158 --> 01:16.576
Davenport Rakes becomes

01:16.576 --> 01:18.703
the city's exclusive rake provider.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.122
- Ooh.
- Now look, this is a work trip, people.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.833
I'll need a trusted team
to come with, <i>mi familia.</i>

01:23.833 --> 01:26.377
Pim, Jam, Janice, and...

01:26.377 --> 01:27.796
- Korvo.
- Obviously.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.130
- Can you get us Chinese food?
- What?

01:29.130 --> 01:30.256
I'm not getting lunch.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.966
Yeah, that's probably a good call.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.552
You only ordered wonton soup last time.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.970
Doug, can you get us some Chinese food?

01:35.970 --> 01:38.014
- Yes!
- I call a vote to remove Doug.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.058
- All in favor?
- You can't remove Doug, bro,

01:40.058 --> 01:42.352
he's getting us lunch.
Doug, Doug.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.563
Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.023
Yeah, Dougie!

01:47.857 --> 01:50.235
<i>Planet Shlorp was
a perfect utopia,</i>

01:50.235 --> 01:52.487
<i>until the asteroid hit.</i>

01:52.987 --> 01:55.448
<i>One hundred adults and their
replicants were issued a Pupa,</i>

01:55.448 --> 01:57.200
<i>and escaped into the... Space,</i>

01:57.200 --> 01:59.536
<i>searching for new homes
on uninhabited worlds.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:01.329
<i>We crashed on Earth,</i>

02:01.329 --> 02:03.623
<i>stranding us on an already
overpopulated planet.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:05.333
<i>That's right, I've been talking
this whole time.</i>

02:05.333 --> 02:06.459
<i>I'm the one holding the Pupa.</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:08.128
<i>My name is Korvo. This is my show.</i>

02:08.128 --> 02:09.462
<i>Bollocks, I just dropped the Pupa.</i>

02:09.462 --> 02:11.339
<i>Ugh. This is ridiculous. I hate Earth.</i>

02:11.339 --> 02:12.549
<i>It's a horrible home.</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:14.217
<i>People are stupid and confusing.</i>

02:14.217 --> 02:15.844
<i>It's disgusting how they treat bananas.</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:17.929
<i>They just strip their peels
and throw them away.</i>

02:17.929 --> 02:19.973
<i>That's the banana's house, you assholes!</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:27.397
Ugh!

02:27.397 --> 02:28.940
Being grounded sucks.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.233
We don't deserve this.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.860
Well, we ruined the school dance

02:31.860 --> 02:33.319
by smashing someone with logs

02:33.319 --> 02:34.946
and then put tiny penises

02:34.946 --> 02:37.198
all over one of the Staci's bodies.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.617
Yeah, but I'm bored, which is way worse.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.827
Oh, I know what we can do!

02:40.827 --> 02:41.911
Let's listen to the latest

02:41.911 --> 02:44.289
Daft Trunk album again! Aah!

02:44.289 --> 02:46.166
<i>♪ This shit's fire,
this shit is fire ♪</i>

02:46.166 --> 02:47.292
I hate Daft Trunk.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.626
They're just the Wooden City knock-off

02:48.626 --> 02:49.919
of The Chemical Brothers.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.254
Just take me to the Wooden City, Terry.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.380
Take me, take me.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.464
Korvo, this is a high-level

02:53.464 --> 02:54.549
professional business trip.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.633
Essential personnel only.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.926
You're taking fucking Janice.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.469
She gets three ear infections a year

02:58.469 --> 03:00.180
from holding her nose when she sneezes.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.599
She scored very high on her peer reviews,

03:02.599 --> 03:03.933
and she said her only weakness is

03:03.933 --> 03:05.143
Cheesecake Factory cheesecake.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.227
That's so likable.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.687
Ooh, Wooden City! Can I go?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.147
Daft Trunk is doing a super-secret

03:09.147 --> 03:11.024
album-release party this week.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.318
Oh, cool, so you can meet up
with their other fan?

03:13.318 --> 03:14.861
Obviously not, you're grounded.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.322
But they're my favorite band of all time.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.365
They're my Harry Styles.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.825
Sorry, Jesse, we have to stay normal,

03:20.825 --> 03:22.744
so the Pupa doesn't turn into steam again.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.412
That's why Terry and I have
to keep these jobs

03:24.412 --> 03:26.080
and you have to be punished.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.541
Don't make me say pwease.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.543
Pwease!

03:30.543 --> 03:32.253
J-friend, you're naturally turning to me

03:32.253 --> 03:34.339
because I have giant
boss energy. I get it.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.883
But I'm an adult, and my word
is my bond. You're grounded.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.259
Oh, that's my

03:38.259 --> 03:39.427
<i>Fraggle Rock</i>-themed Hummer limo.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.595
I made the driver dress up

03:40.595 --> 03:42.096
like a Doozer. Bye!

03:43.640 --> 03:45.141
Shitty-shit-shit, Excel.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.434
Damn your shitty VLOOKUPs

03:46.434 --> 03:48.394
and rudimentary rectangular cells.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.646
Hey, big Korvy.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.730
You like Mars bars, dude?

03:50.730 --> 03:51.814
Our proximity does not

03:51.814 --> 03:53.399
make us friends, leave me alone.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.693
- How about Milky Way?
- Of course, I like Milky Way bars.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.111
They happen to taste exactly like

03:57.111 --> 03:58.279
the background radiation

03:58.279 --> 03:59.656
from the actual Milky Way.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.241
Ha! Outside the US,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.368
the Milky Way recipe is a Mars bar.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.536
Jesus Christ, Doug,
enough with the candy trivia.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.581
Every fucking conversation,
you contort back to candy.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.124
If I hear another goddamn candy fact,

04:10.124 --> 04:11.209
I'm gonna hurt you.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.211
Alright, yeah, got it, huh.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.297
You know the nougat is--

04:21.177 --> 04:22.428
Yo, put Doug on.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.305
The man who was once Doug
is now a stapler.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.891
Korvs, you can't turn my
employees into office supplies.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.268
How was I supposed to know that?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.436
I've never done it before.
This was my first one.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.231
I needed Doug for a specific
Doug-task only Doug can do.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.775
- He's the Doug dog.
- What? I love specificity.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.568
Ehh, I doubt it, but fine.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.903
Go to my house and get the Pupa.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.780
Why the hell did you think
I couldn't do that?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.323
It's my house and my Pupa.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.908
Eh, it just felt like a Doug gig.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.494
The Pupa's a very important part
of my presentation

04:46.494 --> 04:49.205
to the comptroller. I need him A-S-A-Piss.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.999
Is that what you think the P stands for?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.166
Hello?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.584
Swish!

04:54.252 --> 04:56.421
Nice shot, nothing but net.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.006
Would you stop playing Pupa-shot?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.841
He's not an arcade game, for fuck's sake.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.718
- Why aren't you at work?
- I have to bring the Pupa

05:01.718 --> 05:03.177
to the Wooden City. Terry's already

05:03.177 --> 05:05.138
screwing up his presentation
for the comptroller.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.514
Ooh, comptroller is

05:06.514 --> 05:08.224
the second-fanciest political job

05:08.224 --> 05:10.143
right after procurement clerk.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.437
Get your balls
out of the Pupa while I change.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.481
This is our chance
to sneak out to the Wooden City

05:15.481 --> 05:17.025
and see Daft Trunk.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.526
Nah-uh, we gotta be normal.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.610
What's more normal than

05:19.610 --> 05:21.154
sneaking out while you're grounded?

05:21.154 --> 05:24.198
Plus, there will be a lot
of Wooden City street food.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.035
Ooh, Shrub-Ka-Bobs! Okay, I'm sold.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.370
Now we just gotta figure out
a way to sneak out of here,

05:29.370 --> 05:31.164
so Korvo doesn't see us.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.707
Three-pointer!

05:36.711 --> 05:38.588
Shut up!

05:38.588 --> 05:40.048
You shut up!

05:48.097 --> 05:49.515
Oh!

05:49.515 --> 05:50.892
Don't exercise in the daytime!

05:50.892 --> 05:52.060
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.228
Fuck you, you stupid wooden piece of shit.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.106
Thanks, Pupes.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.484
Why am I even paying for Hulu insurance

05:59.484 --> 06:01.652
if it doesn't cover me
for zoning out behind the wheel?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.780
I'm switching to Disney+ insurance.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.323
What do you mean it's the same company?

06:05.323 --> 06:06.491
How does that make any sense?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.575
Put me on with Ramy.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.910
I demand to talk to Ramy.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.537
Alright, listen up.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.705
This is how we get into

06:12.705 --> 06:14.540
Daft Trunk's VIP album-release party.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.209
Two tacos el pa-STONE,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.336
and do you have any fa-LEAF-el pockets?

06:18.336 --> 06:20.213
The only way to get
into the concert tonight,

06:20.213 --> 06:21.798
is with a Golden Beet.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.132
Daft Trunk hid them around the city

06:23.132 --> 06:24.592
and put clues in their music.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.511
It's like a scavenger hunt.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.347
<i>♪ This shit's fire, this shit is fire ♪</i>

06:29.347 --> 06:32.058
- This isn't music.
- Fire, burn.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.394
They're singing about
the Great Fire Memorial site.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.853
The fire we started back in the day?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.564
Why, it was good, but I don't
know if I'd call it great.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.150
Wait, I want some barbecue-pulled bark.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.780
Thanks, Doug.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.198
You know I'm not Doug.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.158
Mm. Mm. Hmm!

06:52.578 --> 06:53.830
This is how you're prepping

06:53.830 --> 06:55.581
for the biggest presentation
of your career?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.125
With a vanity ice luge?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.918
Pff, this doesn't even look like you.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.003
Your luge trough isn't anywhere
near this narrow.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.672
Alright, here we go.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.965
Why did you even need the Pupa?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.842
I don't like him exposed
to all this stupidity.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.635
Next thing you know,
he'll be rooting for the Astros

07:07.635 --> 07:08.803
and chugging Five Loko.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.346
His faccia unlocks my briefcase.

07:11.889 --> 07:12.974
What the hell?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.517
Woodchuck E. Trees tokens?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.894
I'm gonna take the comptroller
to Woodchuck E. Trees

07:16.894 --> 07:18.938
and show him a good time
so that we can close this deal.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
That's a casino for children!

07:20.481 --> 07:22.066
Comptroller is a professional.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.444
He needs to be wined and dined
with adult business-y things,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.695
like 50-year-old bottles of Scotch

07:25.695 --> 07:27.196
and discussions about the economy.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.365
We're gonna play Skee-Ball
and talk about my new invention,

07:29.365 --> 07:30.450
the Earth Rake.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.618
All rakes rake the Earth.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.036
You're going to tank the company.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.289
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead
and pull rake rank on you

07:36.289 --> 07:37.707
and send you back to the office.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.417
Your energy's really bringing
my shit down.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.961
I just drove three hours
so you could open a briefcase.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.046
Your boss hath spoken!

07:47.133 --> 07:49.093
We take a moment of silence

07:49.093 --> 07:51.596
to honor those that we lost
in the Great Fire.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.847
If you listen closely,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.932
you can hear the dead speaking to us,

07:54.932 --> 07:56.267
perhaps giving us hope

07:56.267 --> 07:58.144
for what awaits on the other side.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.729
There's nothing fucking here.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.898
Ugh, I hate touching

08:01.898 --> 08:03.274
people's failed wet wishes.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.402
We have to be missing something.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.489
Burn burn burn, behind
the Alba Rock.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.949
We need to find
a Jessica Alba-shaped rock.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.034
Look!

08:13.576 --> 08:14.577
Yay!

08:15.161 --> 08:16.704
Shit, I know there aren't

08:16.704 --> 08:18.748
two aliens in my town right now.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.832
Nah-uh, son.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.167
Oh, sorry, bullies, we're just--

08:21.167 --> 08:22.793
Go back where you came from.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.421
Wood City for wood citizens.
Build the wall!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.507
Focus your message already.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.468
No, they took the Beet!

08:30.468 --> 08:33.095
Hey, do you think if we smashed
their heads together,

08:33.095 --> 08:35.556
- they'd look better?
- Hey, stumps! Leave them alone.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.184
Don't make me show you
my Timothée Chalamet moves.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.477
Whatever, Pinecone.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.521
Just doing our civic duty.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.357
You two should not be wandering
around the city alone.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.108
We were just looking for Hot Beets.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.986
For the Daft Trunk
VIP release party?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.613
Me too, I'm obsessed.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.697
- Trunk buddies.
- Ugh. Gross.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.907
According to their Stick Tok,

08:52.907 --> 08:54.784
there are only a few Beets left.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.119
Maybe we team up and find them together?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.372
I know this city like the back of my cone,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.249
and I have a motorcycle.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.252
Wow, a way to get somewhere
that's less safe than a car?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.378
Shotgun!

09:08.756 --> 09:10.174
I need you to chill here and be the most

09:10.174 --> 09:11.717
entertained you've ever been.
I know you love

09:11.717 --> 09:13.511
the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,

09:13.511 --> 09:16.305
so here's a pop-it shaped like
the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.598
Ooh!

09:17.598 --> 09:18.891
Hey, Janice, you big dummy.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.601
Do a shot from my floppy slot.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.728
Class of 2023 forever!

09:22.728 --> 09:25.606
What the fuck are you doing back?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.024
Terry, you keep bossing me around,

09:27.024 --> 09:28.776
and it's extremely sexy.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.695
I wanna do fun, kinky hotel stuff with you

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
and destroy a bed
we'll never have to see again.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.700
Uh, uh, phew, we need the room.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.619
Janice, clear my schedule
for the next 15, no, 16 minutes.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.329
Actually, wait, 15, 15 was right.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
So, you like it when I'm the boss, huh?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.839
It makes me want to lick
your spacious teeth

09:49.839 --> 09:51.424
and tie these delicate wrists down.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.800
Oh!

09:53.134 --> 09:55.595
Oh, shit, that's so tight
on my fragile wrists.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.138
Oh, hey, where are you going?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.806
Oh, fuck, are you <i>Gerald's Gaming</i> me?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.099
You're the one who taught me to use

10:00.099 --> 10:02.143
mid-tier Stephen King plots to get my way.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.687
But why? You said I was the sexy boss.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.814
I can't let you tank
the Wooden City contract.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.316
The stakes are way too high.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.985
Korvo, don't <i>Gerald's Game</i> me! Wait!

10:10.985 --> 10:13.946
I fell asleep in that movie,
and I don't know how it ends.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.201
Nothing like swingin' the old golf ball

10:19.201 --> 10:21.162
after a week of comptrolling, am I right?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.873
What happened to that Terry fellow?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.000
He was gonna show me an Earth Rake.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.752
Look, I can tell you're disappointed,

10:27.752 --> 10:29.712
or maybe you just have
a resting birch face,

10:29.712 --> 10:32.214
but I'm prepared to play
the most boring round of golf,

10:32.214 --> 10:34.467
just to show you
how serious Davenport Rakes is

10:34.467 --> 10:35.718
about getting your business.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.802
Wanna make this interesting?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.054
I'll bet you a thousand bucks

10:38.054 --> 10:39.805
you can't make your shot behind that tree.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.850
I have a name. It's Chris Pine.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.019
Uh, sure, if you need me to impress you,

10:45.019 --> 10:46.729
I-I-I can sink that.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.573
Holy Shiv Roy.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.116
Okay, double or nothing.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.413
Ugh, triple or nothing.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.375
Quadruple or nothing.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.211
Duo-nipple or nothing.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.048
We had a similar game on the home world,

11:14.048 --> 11:15.257
except if you lost,

11:15.257 --> 11:17.009
your eyeballs were used
on the driving ranges.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.636
I used to have a third eye in my armpit.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.807
<i>Front desk.</i>

11:22.807 --> 11:24.392
Help, I've been <i>Gerald's Gamed.</i>

11:24.392 --> 11:25.851
<i>If we sent help to everyone</i>

11:25.851 --> 11:27.061
<i>who was being</i> Gerald's Gamed,

11:27.061 --> 11:28.771
<i>we'd have no time to sniff your boxers.</i>

11:28.771 --> 11:30.272
I'm a major Rake Executive

11:30.272 --> 11:31.982
at a Fortune five billion company.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.694
Sorry the elevator is out,

11:34.694 --> 11:35.861
so I had to take the stairs,

11:35.861 --> 11:37.405
and I forgot to take my heart meds.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.823
But luckily,

11:38.823 --> 11:40.616
I was able eat this Philly Treesteak

11:40.616 --> 11:42.493
on the way up. Mm-mmm.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.869
Not loving this pattern.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.330
Let me just--

11:46.330 --> 11:48.457
Okay, now this is exactly like the poster

11:48.457 --> 11:49.542
from <i>Gerald's Game.</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:50.626
No!

11:51.919 --> 11:53.879
I don't understand
why the Beet wasn't in there.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.840
The lyrics were,
"Bigger, faster, stronger.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.925
Bigger, faster, Apple store stronger."

11:57.925 --> 11:59.218
Oh, shit!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.389
Hey, yo, stop that.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.933
I just built that apple tower, come on!

12:05.933 --> 12:08.060
Hang on. The apple store lyrics are

12:08.060 --> 12:09.395
from the song <i>Take A Bite.</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:10.688
What if--

12:11.772 --> 12:14.275
- Mm-hmm.
- Good idea, the girl.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.152
Nut up and take a bite, bitch.

12:16.485 --> 12:20.614
Gonna have to pay for that.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.866
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.118
The Beet!

12:24.618 --> 12:26.746
And there's a map
to the venue on the back.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.038
Wow, great work kid.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.707
Come on, let's jump on the old chopper.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.083
I know a shortcut.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.546
Now, drop that Beet.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.173
Pinecone, what are you doing?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.425
This VIP pass can admit all of us.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.885
I don't give a shit about that.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.344
I fucking hate Daft Trunk.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.597
I'm not even a lovable pinecone.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.017
- You're a rotten peach.
- Ew!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.393
You're damn right, I am.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.686
Now gimme that Beet.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.854
But why?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.856
I needed gas money for my trip to Atlanta,

12:53.856 --> 12:56.150
because this thing only gets
five mpg on the highway

12:56.150 --> 12:58.319
because of the sidecar, which I only have

12:58.319 --> 13:00.446
because my girlfriend
is going to sit in it

13:00.446 --> 13:01.530
when I pick her up.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.782
I gotta see my girlfriend

13:02.782 --> 13:04.158
A-S-A-Piss,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.910
because she's stuck with
a couple of male roommates

13:05.910 --> 13:07.411
who give her massages all the time.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.371
Aww, she must be so stressed out.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.166
Oh, buddy, I don't think
she's your girlfriend anymore.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.250
Shut the fuck up!

13:13.250 --> 13:14.835
That's what everyone always says.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.754
No one ever accepted me
in this shitty town

13:16.754 --> 13:19.465
because peaches aren't native
to the woods.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.593
I was a lonely peach,
left as trash from a tiki drink,

13:22.593 --> 13:24.929
<i>when this entire city was created.</i>

13:24.929 --> 13:26.013
<i>I never really fit in.</i>

13:26.013 --> 13:27.181
My whole life has been

13:27.181 --> 13:28.474
proving my worth to everyone.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.809
So I'm gettin' outta here

13:29.809 --> 13:31.936
and meeting up with my girlfriend

13:31.936 --> 13:34.021
in Atlanta, Georgia.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.606
And when I show up, it's gonna be

13:35.606 --> 13:37.566
a big surprise to my girlfriend,

13:37.566 --> 13:40.110
because she's not
returning my calls right now.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.071
I'm sure her phone is probably broken.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.198
One of her muscular, platonic friends

13:44.198 --> 13:45.616
probably stepped on it.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.785
Gimme that shit
and don't you dare follow me.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.453
You're pussies.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.247
Can you believe that?

13:51.247 --> 13:54.416
No, those guys are definitely
nailing his girlfriend.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.335
I-I need you to send someone else.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.170
You keep sending a bunch of silly gooses

13:58.170 --> 13:59.964
who all end up dying on me by tripping

13:59.964 --> 14:01.632
and heart-attacking and peanut-allerging.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.971
You're being <i>Gerald's Gamed</i> too?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.848
Ah, we're Bachman buddies.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.558
Oh God,

14:10.558 --> 14:12.560
I gotta win my money back.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.144
Let's bet on something else.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.604
How about we shift gears,
forget about the fact

14:15.604 --> 14:18.607
that you owe me $250K,
and talk about Davenport Rakes?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.944
I can't focus on a fucking
landscaping presentation

14:21.944 --> 14:23.404
until I win my money back.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.656
Ooh, the spicy owl wing challenge.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.575
If I beat it, I don't owe you shit,

14:27.575 --> 14:30.160
but if I lose, I'll listen
to your presentation.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.872
Sir, those are extremely spicy
and you might die,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.874
but I'd be an idiot not to
take that bet. You're on.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.260
You took advantage of my obsession

14:46.260 --> 14:48.095
with fucking in a fun vacation setting.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.556
This is something I should have done

14:50.556 --> 14:53.309
a long time ago.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.060
Or at the very least, like,
a few hours ago,

14:55.060 --> 14:56.645
and we would've avoided all of this.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.276
Rake fight!

15:19.960 --> 15:22.588
This is exactly why you
could never be a real boss.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.007
Real leadership takes embracing
boring, grown-up stuff.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.884
It's more than just parties
with ice sculptures,

15:26.884 --> 15:28.385
and coming up with dumb inventions.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.220
That's it, my Earth Rake.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.064
Oh, fuck!

15:49.448 --> 15:52.409
Ooh, very clean, they did a nice job.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.334
Why does a town even need this much honey?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.544
Shit damn, this is delicious!

16:02.544 --> 16:05.881
Aw, I've loved Daft Trunk
since I discovered them on <i>SNL.</i>

16:05.881 --> 16:07.967
And now I'll probably never meet them.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.552
Why don't we just break in
to the party <i>Ocean's 8</i> style,

16:10.552 --> 16:12.221
the only <i>Ocean</i> movie I recognize?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.681
We don't know where it is.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.058
The map was on the back of the Beet.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.352
That rotten peach took my stuff.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.646
We'll never find another clue.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.273
We'd have to know all their
amazing lyrics by heart.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.858
Wait a minute.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.151
I know all the lyrics to every

16:26.151 --> 16:27.569
Daft Trunk song ever made,

16:27.569 --> 16:29.822
because I, Yumyulack Opposites,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.157
am a huge Daft Trunk fan.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.951
But why did you pretend to hate

16:33.951 --> 16:35.577
the raddest band of all time?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.122
I have an anarchist reputation
to protect, yo.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.457
Anyway, there are some lyrics
that I've been thinking about

16:40.457 --> 16:41.542
that might help us.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.210
<i>♪ Party in the sky ♪</i>

16:43.210 --> 16:45.045
<i>♪ Party like you're dying of pink eye ♪</i>

16:45.045 --> 16:47.089
I don't even remember that song.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.341
I paid $10,000 for a bonus track they made

16:49.341 --> 16:50.718
for a friend who died of pink eye.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.219
- Bless up.
- Wow, Yum,

16:52.219 --> 16:53.804
you are a real fan.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.889
"Party in the sk--"

16:55.889 --> 16:57.266
There!

17:00.602 --> 17:01.687
This is all your fault.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.439
Oh, I unleashed a space rake

17:03.439 --> 17:06.025
that hit a giant beehive tower
that flooded us in honey?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.068
None of this would've happened
if you just believed in me.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.361
You were gonna take the comptroller

17:09.361 --> 17:10.654
to Woodchuck E. Trees.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.031
I did my research.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.824
That comptroller is a degenerate gambler.

17:13.824 --> 17:17.369
Woodchuck E Trees is basically
just a very winnable casino.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.204
Oh, my God, you're right.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.956
All day, he was just trying to win.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.917
Terry, I'm sorry.
I should've believed in you.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.669
From now on, I see you as a leader.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.756
And we're equal leaders,
you at work, and me at home.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
Oh God, w-w-we're sinking.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.927
We only have time for one call
before we're totally dipped.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.637
- Give it to me.
- No fucking way.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.222
Believe in me as a leader.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.436
<i>Hello, Leaf Malnati's Pizza.</i>

17:42.436 --> 17:44.646
Goddamn it, Terry,
why would you order a pizza?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.482
<i>Hello, I got a lot
of customers, man. Hello?</i>

17:46.482 --> 17:47.775
Can I get a large pepperoni...

17:49.610 --> 17:51.111
with garlic, green peppers...

17:52.154 --> 17:53.405
artichoke hearts and

17:54.615 --> 17:56.408
fresh tomatoes, please?

18:04.458 --> 18:05.751
Got your pie, man.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.877
Tracked your phone to your location.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.337
That'll be 27 bucks.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.049
Uh, it tastes so good though.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.258
How did you know that would work?

18:13.258 --> 18:14.635
If they don't complete a delivery,

18:14.635 --> 18:15.886
it comes out of their paycheck.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.097
They get placed faster
than emergency services.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.598
I'm, I'm impressed, Terry.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.018
Yeah, I don't have any cash on me.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.728
Korvo, can you pay the man?

18:24.728 --> 18:27.314
Did you really need to order
the most expensive toppings

18:27.314 --> 18:28.440
for a rescue pizza?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.275
Boo, once you have pizza with artichokes,

18:30.275 --> 18:32.569
you will never fuck with choke-less again.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.368
Wowie!

18:40.077 --> 18:41.161
We're gonna have to sneak in

18:41.161 --> 18:42.496
through that "Winnie The Pooh" hole.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.289
I'll climb on your shoulders
to get in there,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.125
then I'll open the side door
and you can come in.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.293
Wait, why don't I climb on your shoulders?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.837
Because you're stronger than me

18:49.837 --> 18:51.255
from carrying all the character work.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.506
- I'm just a cipher.
- Yeah.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.924
Your stories are pretty thin.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.093
Alright, get your
two-dimensional ass up there.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.224
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God,

19:02.224 --> 19:03.350
I'm a huge fan.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.685
I bought every one of your albums.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.894
Can you sign something for me?

19:05.894 --> 19:08.147
My bounty belt? No, my face!

19:09.148 --> 19:11.191
Oh, the bullies from earlier?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.860
Look, it's that alien trash.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.403
I thought we blocked your sorry ass

19:14.403 --> 19:17.030
- so you couldn't find any Beets.
- Yet here you are,

19:17.030 --> 19:19.741
crawling around like a wormy
bitch where you're not wanted.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.368
This is just like your second album,

19:21.368 --> 19:22.536
<i>Never Meet Your Heroes,</i>

19:22.536 --> 19:23.871
<i>Because They Turn Out to be Bullies.</i>

19:23.871 --> 19:26.957
I think he wants an autograph on his face.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.714
Yay, let's go!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.549
Whoa, what happened?

19:35.549 --> 19:37.217
Jesse, there's something you should know.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.761
- I met Daft Trunk.
- Shut your face, shut it.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.889
Oh, my God, open your face
and tell me what they were like.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.973
They were...

19:45.517 --> 19:48.353
amazing, like,
better than you could imagine.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.688
I frigging knew it.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.315
Oh gosh, I gotta get in there.
How do I look?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.649
You just missed them.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.775
I saw them on their way out.

19:53.775 --> 19:54.985
They think they're doing the

19:54.985 --> 19:56.486
<i>Smartless</i> podcast in the morning, so,

19:56.486 --> 19:57.696
party's over.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.114
Oh, geez.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.949
But I did get you one of their helmets.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.701
Ah, no way. Get outta here!

20:02.701 --> 20:04.703
Being grounded with you is the best thing

20:04.828 --> 20:06.288
that's ever happened to me.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.041
Seven wings.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.335
I did it, I ate all seven.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.711
Korvo...

20:12.711 --> 20:14.004
I'm so happy right now,

20:14.004 --> 20:15.797
I'll say yes to anything
you have to pitch.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.382
I would love to close this deal,

20:17.382 --> 20:19.009
but this win belongs to Terry.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.510
He's the real boss of our company

20:20.510 --> 20:21.887
and deserves all of the credit.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.971
Thank you, Korvo.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.515
- Mr. Comptroller, I quit.
- What?

20:25.515 --> 20:27.226
I can just be an equal boss at home.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.102
Zero commute time and no Doug.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.479
But home is my castle.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.730
Plus, you gotta keep this job

20:31.730 --> 20:33.357
or the Pupa will turn into steam again.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.944
As the Pupa specialist,
let me say, he's fucking fine.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.321
We just had a whole sci-fi rake
fight in a Wooden City,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.531
and the Pupa hasn't done anything crazy.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.200
Wait, where is he?

20:43.533 --> 20:44.868
- Ah!
- Ah, he's dead!

20:44.868 --> 20:46.954
Shit, we left him in the car
with the windows up.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.121
Holy shit!

20:48.121 --> 20:49.998
Oh, thank God, he was just sleeping.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.042
Forgot how he looks super ugly
when he sleeps.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.126
Fuck, that was scary.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.753
Terry, that was our wake-up call.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.464
We will never leave the Pupa
in the car alone again.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.967
Oh, they have a
Displaced Aboriginal Steakhouse!

20:59.967 --> 21:01.426
Let's get some Uluru Poppers.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.848
Damn it, Terry, I've nearly detangled

21:06.974 --> 21:08.225
the entire wiring of the ship myself,

21:08.225 --> 21:09.434
and you haven't done a damn thing.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.602
And we wouldn't even be

21:10.602 --> 21:11.937
in this situation if you had combed

21:11.937 --> 21:13.772
leave-in conditioner
through the wires like I asked.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.649
As an equal leader, I get an equal vote

21:15.649 --> 21:17.067
in whether or not I work on the ship.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.485
And my vote went to watching videos

21:18.485 --> 21:20.070
of this hamster try to eat a watermelon.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.321
Terry, you lazy motherf--

21:21.321 --> 21:22.739
What is that horrible sound?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.409
Where did she even get that stupid helmet?

21:26.702 --> 21:29.413
I'm gonna rip you apart, alien scumnut.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.623
Aw, Daft shrunk.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.840
The fuck?

21:48.473 --> 21:50.934
Greetings, newcomer, and congratulations.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.228
Congratulations for what? This sucks.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.148
For being chosen by Jesse, of course.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.607
Ha, fuck that little freak.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.068
Do you not pledge
your heart and soul to Jesse,

22:00.068 --> 22:01.320
our one and only savior?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.779
She and her stupid brother are the ones

22:02.779 --> 22:04.448
who put us in here. We hate them.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.742
Nobody speaks of Jesse that way.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.745
Get your hands fucking off my guy!

22:15.250 --> 22:19.421
There is no room
for heathens in bowed heaven.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.173
No, no, no, no, no.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.842
Please, no!
