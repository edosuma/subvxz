01:36.297 --> 01:37.429
Hey!

01:45.673 --> 01:47.806
Stop the fucking car, man.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.646
Yo, man, you better be
glad you stopped, dipshit.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.382
Sorry, man. I didn't
see you, man.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.617
Move your ass.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.152
Let's go.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.858
So where are you
headed anyways, man?

02:05.860 --> 02:07.659
Just cruising, man.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.195
I got to down and see
my asshole parole officer.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.864
I got some chicks
lined up for tonight.

02:11.866 --> 02:14.399
No shit?

02:14.401 --> 02:16.268
No shit.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.374
Crump's brother? Don't lie.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.742
Guy's still in jail, man.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.711
Naw, man. They let him out.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.614
He was telling me about these
full-on radical chicks

02:28.616 --> 02:30.883
he's got down by
the Frankie avalon place.

02:30.885 --> 02:33.552
They're from up north.
They're all hot to party.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.721
Hear that? Crump's
brother's got some chicks.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.356
No shit.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.259
It's been a while since I
seen chicks around here.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.627
What's the ratio, man?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.328
I heard there's only two.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.231
Bunk. Crump's brother's
a fucking psycho.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.566
I ain't worming his chicks.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.867
Not even, man.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.769
I don't want to end up
like that samoan dude.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.540
No, shit. You'd have to be
a crazy, hard-up bastard

02:54.542 --> 02:56.175
to worm
crump's brother's chicks.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.277
Not even, man.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.312
No way, man.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.690
Hey, tack, where are you going?

03:24.205 --> 03:25.938
<i>¶ Finished with my woman ¶</i>

03:25.940 --> 03:28.340
<i>¶ 'cause she couldn't help me ¶</i>

03:28.342 --> 03:29.675
<i>¶ with my mind ¶</i>

03:29.677 --> 03:31.944
<i>¶ people think I'm insane ¶</i>

03:31.946 --> 03:35.681
<i>¶ because I am frowning</i>
<i>all the time ¶</i>

03:47.528 --> 03:50.429
<i>¶ all day long</i>
<i>I think of things ¶</i>

03:50.431 --> 03:53.232
<i>¶ but nothing seems</i>
<i>to satisfy ¶</i>

03:53.234 --> 03:55.567
<i>¶ think I'll lose my mind</i>
<i>if I ¶</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:59.438
<i>¶ don't find something</i>
<i>to gratify ¶</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:00.906
oh! Oh!

04:00.908 --> 04:03.575
<i>¶ Can you help me? ¶</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:06.712
<i>¶ won't you find my brain? ¶</i>

04:06.714 --> 04:10.315
<i>¶ whoa, yeah ¶</i>

04:22.730 --> 04:25.530
<i>¶ I need someone to show me ¶</i>

04:25.532 --> 04:28.700
<i>¶ the things in life</i>
<i>that I can't find ¶</i>

04:28.702 --> 04:30.669
<i>¶ I can't see the things ¶</i>

04:30.671 --> 04:33.005
<i>¶ that make true happiness ¶</i>

04:33.007 --> 04:34.873
<i>¶ I must be blind ¶</i>

04:40.481 --> 04:43.548
<i>¶ make a joke and I will sigh ¶</i>

04:43.550 --> 04:46.385
<i>¶ and you will laugh</i>
<i>and I will cry ¶</i>

04:46.387 --> 04:48.920
<i>¶ happiness I cannot feel ¶</i>

04:48.922 --> 04:52.758
<i>¶ and love to me</i>
<i>is so unreal... ¶</i>

05:08.442 --> 05:10.309
so you got a plan tonight
or what?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.311
Fuck, yeah, I got a plan, man.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.313
I got a radically
hellacious plan.

05:14.315 --> 05:17.683
First we get a shitload
of tall cans, right,

05:17.685 --> 05:20.652
then an eight-ball...
no! A quarter o.Z.,

05:20.654 --> 05:23.422
a fifth of Jack just
to take the edge off.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.824
Then we spark up the thick
verlacious ganga bud,

05:25.826 --> 05:27.726
get those chicks
all horn dogged out.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.495
We're just going to do
what we always do...

05:30.497 --> 05:32.397
drive around like dumb fucks

05:32.399 --> 05:35.901
then end up at stop-n-go, eating
those reynaldo's burritos.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.737
Shut up, Joe fag!

05:38.739 --> 05:41.440
You got an attitude
problem, man.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.342
I'm sick of always
doing the same shit.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.776
What else we going to do?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.778
I don't know, there's got
to be something more

05:46.780 --> 05:48.480
than driving around torrance

05:48.482 --> 05:50.449
trying to get drunk,
stoned, and laid.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.984
Joe, you're been
weirding out on me.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.553
I'm not weirding out
on you, man.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.789
Yeah, you are.
Ever since blue oyster cult.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.358
You got hit by that laser, man,

05:59.360 --> 06:00.959
you've been acting
like a pussy.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.029
Why don't you take an inventory
what we got going for us.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.131
Shit, man.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.834
It's all dusted.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.106
Except for this beef
and potato burrito, bud.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.074
That's it?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.946
Always got the crock.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.481
The schnappster.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.882
Shit makes me whork.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.818
What about that skank weed
your brother sold you?

06:26.820 --> 06:31.123
Got about half a joint's worth. But
this shit gives me a headache.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.459
Schnappster, half a joint of some ragweed.
That's decent.

06:34.461 --> 06:37.596
Now all we got to do
is find us some chicks.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.031
<i>¶ S.O.S. You hear these words ¶</i>

06:40.033 --> 06:43.135
<i>¶ telling you now</i>
<i>about my state ¶</i>

06:43.137 --> 06:45.871
<i>¶ I tell you to enjoy life ¶</i>

06:45.873 --> 06:49.541
<i>¶ I wish I could,</i>
<i>but it's too late ¶</i>

06:49.543 --> 06:51.710
what the fuck, man?

06:51.712 --> 06:53.478
You want to party with
the buffalo chicks?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.781
And I want to pork
their grandmas, too, man.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.816
They know about some parties.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.690
What's up, <i>mamacitas?</i>

07:05.692 --> 07:07.058
Just hanging.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.528
Anything going on?

07:09.530 --> 07:12.564
Guzzlers have a case of ox
up at petrol park.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.099
What else is new?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.067
Where's the party?

07:16.069 --> 07:19.438
There's a kegger up at muldoon's
parents' place in p.V.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.541
You don't want to party with
them palos verdes queebies, man.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.743
Hey, it's a party.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.445
Who's it going to be,
just you guys?

07:26.447 --> 07:30.916
Yeah. We could play submarine.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.221
Actually, ladies, we're running
a little bit behind schedule.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.156
We got to haul ass.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.192
Where you guys going?

07:40.194 --> 07:43.195
Just cruising, man.
You know how it is.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.464
Have fun.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.641
What the fuck is submarine
anyway, man?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.110
I don't want to know, man.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.118
Shit! My tape.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.621
This fucking machine
just scarfed my tape.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.090
Big shit, man. Put in another.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.506
What the fuck is that?
<i>Don't fear the reaper,</i> man.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.509
You're not playing that pussy shit in
the blue torpedo, man. I told you.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.245
Blue oyster cult.
I don't give a fuck.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.681
It's a pussy song. It's b.O.C.
How can it be pussy?

08:36.683 --> 08:39.951
Let me tell you something. Every band
puts out at least one pussy song

08:39.953 --> 08:42.587
so they can find out who the faggots are.
Now take it out.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.190
Fuck you, man.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.259
Fuck me?

08:47.261 --> 08:50.028
It's a pussy song.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.998
Pussy song, huh, faggot?
Say it! Say it!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.967
O.K., man! All right!
It's a pussy song.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.008
Told you it's a pussy song.

09:19.293 --> 09:22.294
Check it out, man. It's tack.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.296
The tackmeister.
That fucking pud.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.031
Hang a loogie on him.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.866
All right.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.807
Tack, you fag!

09:35.809 --> 09:39.010
Hey, man!
I got some chicks, man!

09:41.181 --> 09:43.281
Tack's got some chicks?

09:49.056 --> 09:51.056
Man, why'd you guys spit at me?

09:51.058 --> 09:54.893
Joe fag. You spit at
my buddy tack, man.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.095
You fucking told me to.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.899
Hubbs, give me a ride
down to the beach, man.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.200
What's going on
down at the beach?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.969
There's some chicks down there.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.171
Yeah? What kind of
chicks we talking?

10:06.173 --> 10:08.640
They're from up north.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.942
They said they want to party.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.778
No shit, man? Up north?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.080
How many chicks?

10:15.082 --> 10:18.283
There's, like,
a shitload of them, man.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.351
You talked to them?

10:19.353 --> 10:22.687
Well, yeah, I talked to them.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.123
What kind of chicks
are gonna talk to tack, man?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.759
I don't know, man. They
must want it real bad.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.394
What, they got, like,
big buffalo butts?

10:29.396 --> 10:31.863
No way. These chicks are fine.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.267
Hey, tack,

10:36.269 --> 10:39.838
we'll trade you this half
joint for the chicks.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.374
It's fucking skank weed, man.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.142
Okay.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.245
We'll give you this entire
bottle of schnappster,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.914
you tell us
where the chicks are.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.850
This shit makes me whork.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.419
This shit'll get six fat chicks
all William holden-style

10:54.421 --> 10:56.054
fucked up.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.989
Fuck that.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.725
Look, I'll tell you
where the chicks are, okay.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.293
Just give me a ride down there.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.095
Where are they?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.131
Let me in the car first.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.333
Why are you trying to worm me
out of the deal for?

11:08.335 --> 11:11.302
Fuck. Let him in.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.178
<i>¶ Feelin' good ¶</i>

11:20.180 --> 11:22.180
<i>¶ can't be real... ¶</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:25.216
tack, where are these
chicks at anyway, man?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.985
Down by torrance beach.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.121
In the stone house across from
the old Frankie avalon place.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.723
Torrance beach?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.926
If I'm going down there,

11:34.928 --> 11:37.262
I'm going to need gas money.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.264
Shit, man, I only got 6 bucks.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.732
So? Give it over.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.933
No way.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.969
That's beer money
for the whole weekend.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.371
Fuck.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.239
Hubbs, man,
we do got half a tank.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.943
No, man, me and you got half a tank.
Tack ain't got shit.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.946
I'm the one who knows
where the chicks are.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.381
Why should I have to pay?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.384
Information without
transportation equals dick.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.952
If it wasn't for us, man,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.887
you'd still be sitting
in the road jerking off.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.723
Get the bucks, Joe.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.991
Come on, tack, pay up.
Ah, shit!

12:06.993 --> 12:08.860
Hey, tack.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.230
Don't you fuck with
my buddy Joe, man.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.033
Now fork, dick.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.736
You bogards, man.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.148
Stay there, tack.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.384
What's up, crump?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.455
Just working, man. You?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.124
Just cruising.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.359
Give us 6 bucks
worth of dinosaur juice.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.095
5 bucks and a pack of reds.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.965
You guys hear about them
chicks my brother's got?

12:46.967 --> 12:50.902
Chicks? No, man. We heard
nothing about no chicks.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.205
My brother's got us
some rad chicks.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.776
I thought your brother got popped
for thrashing that samoan guy.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.246
He got out last week.
The guy lived.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.516
So, crump, where are
these chicks at anyway?

13:04.518 --> 13:06.518
Down by that
Frankie avalon place.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.553
By torrance beach. Oh, yeah?

13:08.555 --> 13:11.389
It's a closed party.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.124
There's only two of them.

13:16.163 --> 13:19.164
Fuck, man. I bet he's talking
about them same chicks.

13:19.166 --> 13:23.434
No shit, dumb fuck.
Tack lied to us.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.936
There's only two of them.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.337
Not even tack's chicks, man.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.339
They're crump's brother's.
Shut up.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.146
It's too bad, man.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.881
What?

13:36.883 --> 13:38.883
Nothing, it's just that
desiree Gibson chick's

13:38.885 --> 13:41.219
doing amateur night
down at dirty Doug's.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.354
You remember her. She was homecoming
queen a couple years back.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.257
Oh, yeah. My brother
digs that chick.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.259
Yeah, man. She's going
to be getting crazy.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.395
There's going to be, like,
this rad party with babes.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.963
No shit?

13:51.965 --> 13:55.099
But you guys got plans.
We got to book.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.202
Hey, no, don't be
cold-blooded, man.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.071
Can you get
me and my brother in?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.206
Yeah, sure.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.341
You got to get there
by 11:00, man.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.876
Remember where it is?
Down the coast.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.279
Yeah, sure. Hey, man, thanks.
I owe you one.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.414
No problem.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.353
Now all we got to do
is ditch tack

14:15.355 --> 14:17.322
and haul ass down there.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.157
We can't worm crump's
brother's chicks.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.159
You saw what he did
to that samoan guy.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.528
Don't worry about it, man. By the
time they get back from dirty Doug's,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.096
we'll be long gone.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.332
We're gonna run
into him sometime, man.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.300
Fuck, Joe,
it doesn't matter anyway.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.569
We heard about the
chicks from tack, right?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.239
As far as we're concerned,
they're tack's chicks.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.140
We ain't worming
crump's brother.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.076
We're worming tack, man.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.078
I can kick tack's ass.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.080
If it wasn't for tack,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.215
we wouldn't even know
about the chicks.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.984
What did I tell you, man?
You're thinking too much.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.185
You just got to go for it.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.393
What's up with crump?
Nothing, man.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.634
Hey, tack, get out and
wash the windows, man.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.335
I bought the gas.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.970
Tack, don't be a dick.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.973
I'm going to haul your
ass down there, man.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.975
I'm going to need
clean windows.

15:10.977 --> 15:14.279
All right, all right. Shit.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.622
Let's go, bro.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.631
Hold up, assholes!

15:33.633 --> 15:35.566
Damn it! Hold up!

15:35.568 --> 15:37.568
Joe, let me in!

15:37.570 --> 15:38.970
Sorry, dude.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.371
Don't be no worm, man.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.240
Damn it, Joe! You mother queer!

15:47.681 --> 15:50.214
Fuck you! Fucking worms!

15:50.216 --> 15:54.519
Whoa, man! It's bobo
night all night tonight.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
What the fuck, man?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.961
What the fuck was that
back there?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.662
You almost blew it.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.664
I don't want to be
no worm, man.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.433
Fuck, man,
don't worry about it.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.301
You know tack,
he's got no class.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.503
He's going to talk shit
and gross the chicks out.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.706
Still ain't cool to worm
his chicks, though.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.075
What the fuck, Joe?

16:17.077 --> 16:20.712
Was that eyeball looking at you again, man?
He'd do the same shit to you.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.014
Still ain't cool.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.717
Fuck, man! We got chicks!

16:25.719 --> 16:27.418
We're going to fuck them
doggie style

16:27.420 --> 16:30.221
and shit on their parents' bed.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.269
There's that
Frankie avalon place.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.347
What are you doing with
that schnappster shit?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.516
Can't show up empty-handed.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.520
Which one is it?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.556
I don't know, man. I don't
hear any party noises.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.258
Whoa!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.498
Looks like there's something
going on over there.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.536
Let's go.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.310
Remember what I told you, man.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.647
Just don't blow it.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.766
Whoa.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.103
Who the fuck are you?

17:52.105 --> 17:56.507
I'm hubbs and this
is my buddy Joe.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
Hey.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.548
We heard you guys
wanted to party.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.451
Oh, yeah?
Where'd you hear that?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.553
From tack.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.822
Who's tack?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.657
Just some dude.

18:12.659 --> 18:17.095
He heard it from crump's
brother, down at the beach.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.165
You guys got any blow?

18:21.167 --> 18:23.868
Uh... No.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.305
You guys got any crank?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.109
No.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.811
Got any 'ludes?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.515
No.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.251
Well, what kind of party
is this going to be?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.819
We got alcohol, man.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.588
What? Like, some
Annie green Springs?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.390
We got the schnappster.
Check it out.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.659
Bitchin'.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.129
You don't dig schnappster?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.231
Yeah, when I was in
seventh grade.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.267
So what do you drink
these days?

18:56.269 --> 18:58.469
151.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.605
Can't you guys
score something like that?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.375
Sure, babe. Whatever you want.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.910
Oh, yeah?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.646
That stuff makes me crazy...

19:08.648 --> 19:11.582
If you know what I mean.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.153
Know what you mean. Yeah,
I know what you mean.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.855
Don't let me down now, boys.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.625
Don't worry about it.

19:22.595 --> 19:27.598
<i>¶ You're rock candy, baby ¶</i>

19:27.600 --> 19:31.202
<i>¶ hot, sweet, and sticky... ¶</i>

19:31.204 --> 19:33.204
where can we score that 151?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.906
I don't know, man, but we
got to score but quick.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.875
Tack and every other dick's
will be all over that place.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.580
<i>¶ Hot, sweet, and sticky ¶</i>

19:42.582 --> 19:43.915
come on, snotrag.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.416
<i>Don't call me that.</i>

19:45.418 --> 19:48.319
O.K., I meant hankey.
Give me a ride.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.488
<i>No, man. I'm watching Dukes of Hazzard.
Leave me alone.</i>

19:50.490 --> 19:53.658
Fuck, man! You want to watch
TV instead of getting laid?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.560
<i>Yeah, man,</i>
<i>it's my favorite show.</i>

19:55.562 --> 19:57.528
I don't care, man.
I'm coming over, then.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.530
<i>I'm tired. Leave me alone.</i>

19:59.532 --> 20:02.533
No, now you pissed me off.
I'm coming over.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.402
<i>No, tack...</i>

20:04.404 --> 20:05.636
man!

20:32.565 --> 20:34.565
Oh, man, check it out.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.335
The samoan dude who tangled
with crump's brother.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.272
Oh, shit!

20:41.274 --> 20:42.907
Whoa!

20:51.884 --> 20:54.318
What's up, superfreak?

21:02.996 --> 21:04.662
Go for it, man.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.931
That disco dude's
going to card me, man.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.000
He makes 2.75 an hour.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.968
You think he gives a shit?
Come on.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.305
Fuck.

21:14.307 --> 21:17.341
<i>¶ Burn, baby, burn ¶</i>

21:18.578 --> 21:21.412
<i>¶ burn, baby, burn... ¶</i>

21:21.414 --> 21:23.848
151.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.384
Are you going to boogie
with the foxes tonight?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.319
You know how it is, bro.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.021
Do a little Annie
green Springs.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.323
The sexies love it.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.758
No, thanks, man.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.761
Your loss. 'Cause I'm
having a special.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.896
If you want to get
these chicks in the mood,

21:38.898 --> 21:42.033
make them move,
put them on the floor,

21:42.035 --> 21:45.770
do the hustle. Put a little
insanity on your potato.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.339
Shake it, man.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.742
<i>It'll make them melt</i>
<i>like a popsicle.</i>

21:55.682 --> 21:57.782
What the fuck you doing, man.
Hey, hubbs.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.356
I need some I.D.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.958
It's cool, man. I'm 25.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.394
Sure. You must have left
your wallet

22:10.396 --> 22:12.363
in your sports coat.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.002
Oh, shit.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.504
Thanks anyway, man.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.642
Michael hubbs. Yo, red.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.078
Back here.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.613
Hey, officer Dean,
how's it going, man?

22:29.615 --> 22:33.451
You two minors wouldn't be trying
to purchase alcohol, would you?

22:33.453 --> 22:36.921
Come on, man, you know
us better than that.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.589
Yeah, I do.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.124
We're still looking
for the punks

22:40.126 --> 22:42.626
who knocked over the liquor
warehouse on crenshaw.

22:42.628 --> 22:43.861
Know anything?

22:43.863 --> 22:47.131
We don't know nothing
about no stolen ox-45.

22:47.133 --> 22:51.135
Just because we got long hair
you think we're criminals.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.839
You guys probably think
I'm a real butthead.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.743
You think I didn't want
to taste a beer

22:58.745 --> 23:01.846
when I was your age?

23:01.848 --> 23:06.851
Hell, they used to call
me "Dixie cup Dean."

23:09.689 --> 23:10.955
Wow!

23:12.492 --> 23:14.859
That's... Cool.

23:14.861 --> 23:19.029
Anyhow, you guys
stay out of trouble.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.664
<i>All right?</i>

23:20.666 --> 23:22.833
O.K., officer.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.404
O.K. You get the twinkies.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.439
I'll get the chocolate milk.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.609
We were totally whipped.
What are we going to do?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.811
Well, you can go home
and spank the monkey

23:33.813 --> 23:35.780
with your greasy grand pappy,

23:35.782 --> 23:37.615
but I'm getting laid, dude.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.017
No way, hubbs, man.
You rule, dude!

23:40.019 --> 23:42.420
Whoo! Whoo!

23:52.432 --> 23:55.099
Tack, what are you
doing here, man?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.735
Fuck you, snotrag. Let's book.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.571
Don't call me that.
My last name's hankey.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.707
All right, hankey.
Don't have a spaz.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.843
Come on, bro,
let's get us some poontang.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.012
Look, I already told you,
I don't want to go there.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.947
Besides, my mom
wouldn't even let me.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.650
What's your mom going to do?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.620
Oh, hello, Mrs. Snot...

24:16.622 --> 24:18.756
<i>Mrs. Hankey.</i>

24:18.758 --> 24:20.858
I was just wondering
if Norman here

24:20.860 --> 24:23.594
might want to go out
and be with some friends.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.697
Oh, that sounds like fun.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.199
I was watching TV.

24:28.201 --> 24:31.735
You really should
get out more, norm.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.837
Come on, mom.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.939
Don't be such a poopy doodle.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.909
Have fun, boys.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.779
Don't eat too many hot dogs.

24:46.219 --> 24:49.753
Um, tack, just be careful
with it, all right?

24:49.755 --> 24:51.722
I've been working on it
all summer.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.190
Don't worry, man.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.230
Tack, watch it!

25:20.553 --> 25:22.219
Who the fuck are you?

25:22.221 --> 25:25.756
You must be looking
for the homo sponge bath party.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.258
It's two doors down.

25:27.260 --> 25:30.060
No, it's cool, man.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.996
We were looking for that girl

25:31.998 --> 25:33.264
with the long blond hair.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.566
<i>She invited us over.</i> Lanie.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.535
We won't thrash.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.303
What took you guys so long?

25:39.305 --> 25:42.039
We just ran into a
few complications.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.842
I don't like waiting
around for high boys.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.911
Too bad you're leaving so soon.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.879
Well, I guess that means

25:48.881 --> 25:52.182
I'm going to have to power
this whole bad Oscar myself.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.928
<i>¶ You're dirty and sweet,</i>
<i>oh, yeah... ¶</i>

26:10.937 --> 26:12.069
wow.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.646
Here you go, babe.

26:22.648 --> 26:26.016
<i>¶ Get it on, bang a gong ¶</i>

26:26.018 --> 26:28.619
<i>¶ get it on ¶</i>

26:30.790 --> 26:33.724
<i>¶ get it on, bang a gong... ¶</i>

26:33.726 --> 26:36.727
this is cool.
You guys got your own pad.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.096
It's not like we own the place.
It's Jill's dad's.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We heard
you guys are from up north.

26:42.735 --> 26:46.070
Yeah, we are. We're just hanging
out at Jill's dad's for a week.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.939
And you better not be
here when he gets back.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.741
Mellow out, Jill.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.776
He'll be back in a
couple of hours.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.879
That's cool.
Gives us enough time.

26:55.881 --> 27:00.017
Oh, yeah? Enough time for what?

27:00.019 --> 27:02.753
Whatever.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.755
God, lanie.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.124
Hey.

27:07.126 --> 27:11.228
You look like that chick
on that virgin killers album.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.163
Yeah, I know.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.002
It's a rad shirt, man.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.803
I was at that concert.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.338
I got all fucked up.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.240
Oh, yeah.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.976
Well, I was backstage
at the Oakland show.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.845
No shit?

27:27.847 --> 27:29.813
We saw b.O.C. At long beach.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.650
They shined one of those
lasers right on me.

27:32.652 --> 27:35.085
Big whoop.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.222
It was rad. It picked
me out of the crowd.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.291
It was when they were doing
<i>don't fear the reaper.</i>

27:41.293 --> 27:42.860
It was a rush.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.029
Yeah, it was verlacious.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.197
Lit his head up like a
fucking Christmas tree.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.932
Enough about you, Joe.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.401
No, no, no, man.

27:50.403 --> 27:54.104
Then everything
just got kind of weird.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.074
Kind of like,<i> 2001,</i> like.

27:57.076 --> 28:02.846
Then there was this huge,
gnarly eyeball out there, man.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.782
Just... just floating.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.786
It was kind of like that
big pig at the Floyd show,

28:08.788 --> 28:11.855
but, I mean...
I mean, this was real.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.026
Guy reminds me of mondo man.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.361
Yeah, kind of.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.464
Who's mondo man?

28:20.466 --> 28:22.399
He's just some dude.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.705
Jill, come here.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.306
Uh-oh.

28:29.308 --> 28:32.076
Conference time.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.111
Mention my name.
You'll get a good seat.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.947
Oh, my God.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.952
Hubbs, who the fuck
is mondo man?

28:41.954 --> 28:43.954
Who the fuck cares, man?

28:43.956 --> 28:46.957
What I tell you, Joe?
You're blowing it.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.727
Man, that chick lanie,
she's so cherry, man.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.195
It hurts.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.730
She's hot for me, man.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.064
Then you woke up.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.199
It's so obvious.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.266
When did this happen?

28:56.268 --> 28:58.736
Don't worry about it.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.038
That chick, she's the
queen of my dreams.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
Hey, you snooze you lose, pud.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.842
Deal with the situation.

29:07.747 --> 29:08.979
Don't you think that hubbs guy

29:08.981 --> 29:11.749
looks like Richie blackmore?

29:11.751 --> 29:13.150
Yeah, I guess.

29:13.152 --> 29:16.086
So, Jill, that other dude
seems pretty cool, huh?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.021
Yeah, right, lanie.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.523
He's a total whacker.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.258
Can't we just tell
those guys to split?

29:21.260 --> 29:25.129
Come on. It's our last day in
L.A., let's have some fun.

29:25.131 --> 29:29.133
What's fun about watching those
burnouts get totally wasted

29:29.135 --> 29:30.968
and thrash my dad's place?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.269
They won't do that.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.538
I'll have them
take us somewhere.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.340
Tell me about it.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.876
They're probably out there
pissing in the ice tray.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.245
Don't be so paranoid.
They're not that lame.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.485
Shit, man, stash it.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.061
What are you guys doing?

29:58.063 --> 29:59.563
Grabbing some munchies, babe.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.331
Who said you could
eat my dad's food?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.066
Don't worry about it.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.536
I'll have to deal with him.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.371
Don't worry.
We won't be around.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.574
God, what a brain trust.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.810
Why is she such a rag, man?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.511
She just needs to get laid.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.848
That's all right, Joe likes 'em feisty.
Ain't that right, Joe?

30:17.850 --> 30:19.216
Shut up, man.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.525
Hey, babe. I heard there
was a party going on here.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.427
Well, just come right in.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.238
Can I get you guys anything?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.873
This is cool.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.144
Hey, are there
any other chicks here,

30:47.146 --> 30:49.880
or are you the only one?

30:49.882 --> 30:51.481
Hey, tack!

30:51.483 --> 30:52.883
Man, this is a closed party.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.384
Fuck you, worm!

30:54.386 --> 30:56.153
So you know these guys?

30:56.155 --> 30:58.222
Sort of. I'll deal with this.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.556
Joe, how's it going?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.024
You and what army, connoly?

31:01.026 --> 31:04.161
Come on, tack. Split.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.296
Hey, bring on the bitches!

31:08.567 --> 31:11.435
Oh, shit, man. I'm going
to scorch my shorts.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.136
Fucking tack, man.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.005
Fuck you, worm.

31:15.007 --> 31:18.108
Would you ladies
excuse me a sec?

31:19.511 --> 31:21.311
Come on, tack. Let's go.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.146
What the fuck is
snotrag doing here?

31:23.148 --> 31:26.016
Hey, man, don't call me that.
I needed a ride.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.618
We been here a while, pud.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.153
Things were going
pretty good for us.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.589
You're messing up
the ratio, man.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.158
It's casual. There's
enough to go around.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.394
You never fuckin' listen, tack.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.230
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with you, man?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.465
Yeah, tack, just be cool.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.233
I'm not going to
forget this, connoly.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.436
Joe, grab snotrag.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.006
Come on, man.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.374
Easy!

31:50.376 --> 31:52.442
Come on. Spaz.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.011
Look at this shit.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.313
Hey, babe, get naked or shut up.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.216
Would you cool it?

31:59.218 --> 32:00.617
You hear that?

32:00.619 --> 32:02.953
These ladies
don't want you around, man.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.221
Big shit.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.691
Is this what you guys do down here?
Weak.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.427
Aren't there any
parties or anything?

32:10.429 --> 32:11.962
There's one in p.V.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.196
Shut up, tack.

32:13.198 --> 32:15.198
No shit? Come on, babe.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.201
You don't want to go to some
bullshit rich boy party.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.539
<i>¶ Nobody gonna beat my car ¶</i>

32:22.541 --> 32:25.709
<i>¶ I'm gonna race it</i>
<i>to the ground ¶</i>

32:25.711 --> 32:28.412
<i>¶ nobody gonna beat my car ¶</i>

32:28.414 --> 32:31.415
<i>¶ I'm gonna break</i>
<i>the speed of sound... ¶</i>

32:39.725 --> 32:41.525
party!

32:43.062 --> 32:45.729
I hate palos verdes.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.464
Hey, what's your name?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.199
Aw, man.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.436
Hey, guys, wait up.

32:52.438 --> 32:56.740
Tack, you going to leave the
monster parked like that?

32:56.742 --> 32:58.342
It's cool. It's a party.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.345
Maybe they'll valet it, hankey.
What a dork.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.047
It's not going to get towed?
Out of the way.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.416
Joe, don't mess around. Don't
make me hurt you, tack.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.719
They're better be a keg here.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.121
All right, get you some.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.123
I hate this disco shit.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.591
I heard that.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.596
Ladies.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.101
Hey, sorry, space case.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.036
Hey, muldoon, it's cool, man.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.105
No, it ain't cool, connoly.

33:28.107 --> 33:31.742
I didn't buy beer
for you burnouts to drink.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.677
Go party with your own kind.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.113
You just let our chicks in.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.583
Hey, that's ladies' night.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.286
We won't drink nothing.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.621
We just want to party.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.690
Yeah, assholes. Let us in.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.361
Later on, losers.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.499
Fuck you, muldoon!

34:00.272 --> 34:02.172
Fucking, tack, man.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.707
Me? It's muldoon.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.143
Let's kick his rich-boy ass.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.812
Fuck, man, I would if he didn't have
such massive upper body strength.

34:08.813 --> 34:12.215
Why did you have to spew to the chicks?
We were styling at the pad.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.751
You dicked me back there.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.719
If it wasn't for you
and this fag,

34:16.722 --> 34:18.822
we'd be having
a titty fest now.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.556
They're my chicks anyway.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.757
Don't talk.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.060
Fuck you.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.293
Fuck me?

34:24.295 --> 34:25.762
Can't we just get along?

34:25.764 --> 34:27.431
Fuck this.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.201
Fucking puds.

34:33.539 --> 34:36.339
Tack, come on, man. I already
missed my favorite show.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.442
Can we just go home already?

34:38.444 --> 34:41.344
I got to take a leak.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.618
Wait up, bro.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.458
Hey, man,
what's biting your ass?

34:55.460 --> 34:58.495
That chick ain't getting away.
She's too rad.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.464
Hey, man, check it out.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.799
Gorge!

35:02.801 --> 35:05.602
Gorge!

35:05.604 --> 35:07.337
What's up, butt benders?

35:07.339 --> 35:09.206
Just guzzling, man.
Just guzzling.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.675
How's it hanging, hubbs?
Here's a beer.

35:13.846 --> 35:17.347
Jesus Christ!
What is this, horse piss?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.816
St. Helen's malted ale.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.685
Pussy rich-boy beer.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.520
Stuff makes you want to puke.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.888
Did you hear
about crump's brother?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.157
He's got these fine chicks.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.359
I didn't hear
nothing like that.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.863
What's the ratio here, man?

35:32.865 --> 35:35.599
It's like 35 to 3 out here.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.168
Inside might be
some better numbers.

35:41.707 --> 35:44.374
Man, there's a buttload
of fine Bettys in there.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.279
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

35:57.489 --> 35:59.489
Bummer.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.159
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

36:05.831 --> 36:08.431
Let's party.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.304
Fuck, man, back
where we started.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.840
What's the problem, guys?

36:16.842 --> 36:18.808
You're here with all
your buddies.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.278
There's plenty of lawn
ornaments to break.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.613
There's another keg, man,
ain't even been tapped yet.

36:23.615 --> 36:27.317
Whoo! Whoo!

37:05.357 --> 37:07.457
Lanie, what's going on?

37:07.459 --> 37:08.959
What a waste.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.994
What's a person got to do

37:10.996 --> 37:13.363
to get any drugs in this city?

37:13.365 --> 37:15.865
I got some loco
back in the torpedo.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.934
Oh, yeah? Why didn't
you say anything?

37:17.936 --> 37:20.303
It's not enough to go around.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.671
Let's bail, man.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.006
Let me get hubbs.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.874
Why?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.676
I hope we get a ride.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.545
Yeah.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.388
Oh, shit.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.857
Oh, damn it. Shit.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.492
Just be cool. Just be cool.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.394
Just lookin' around. Maintain.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.800
What's the problem, officer?

37:50.802 --> 37:53.436
Mmm, party's over.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.606
We have reports of minors
drinking alcohol

37:56.608 --> 37:58.608
and illegal urination

37:58.610 --> 38:01.278
in your neighbor's pool.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.424
Where the fuck are those guys, man?
I got to book.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.293
Lanie ditched me a while ago.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.694
Maybe she left
with your friend.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.029
Joe? Nah.

38:19.031 --> 38:20.497
Well, they're not around.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.999
Fucking Joe.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.936
Move your ass, queebie!

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
Wait up, God damn it.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.615
I got to get back there, man.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.050
I got to kick some ass.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.951
I've got the key.
They can't get inside.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.787
Move your ass, then.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.558
Thanks, but no thanks, fucko.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.096
Bet you got to deal
with that a lot, huh?

38:53.098 --> 38:55.065
Tell me about it. Every day.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.499
Hey...

38:56.501 --> 38:59.102
Let's smoke that joint
in that guy's jacuzzi.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.004
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't wanna get busted.</i>

39:01.006 --> 39:03.907
Don't you want to see me
in my new bikini?

39:09.481 --> 39:11.014
Here. Go for it.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.549
Unh!

39:12.551 --> 39:13.650
Ah!

39:13.652 --> 39:15.018
Sorry.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.866
Check this out.

39:30.902 --> 39:31.868
Whoa.

39:34.373 --> 39:37.107
A-are those, um...
Real puka shells?

39:37.109 --> 39:40.377
Yeah. Jill's dad got it for me.
Pretty cool, huh?

39:41.446 --> 39:43.513
He's kinda got a crush on me.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.815
Her old man? Really?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.123
Come on.
Aren't you gonna get in?

39:53.125 --> 39:55.525
Yeah.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.473
This is the life, huh?

40:10.475 --> 40:11.574
Heard that.

40:13.445 --> 40:18.148
I love getting stoned and
partying all night. Yeah.

40:18.150 --> 40:20.517
I could get into
some b.O.C. Now.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.051
You should.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.988
<i>Agents of fortune</i>
is a total fuck album.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.157
Yeah.

40:27.159 --> 40:29.626
I...Know what you mean.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.094
So, that's lumbo you got?

40:31.096 --> 40:32.629
Yeah.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.432
I mean, it's not, you
know, gold, but...

40:35.434 --> 40:36.900
<i>It's pretty good lumbo.</i>

40:36.902 --> 40:39.869
It's not as good as the stuff
I usually get, though.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.504
Yeah.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.840
You know, I had a feeling
about you tonight...

40:43.842 --> 40:45.542
When I first saw you.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.477
I just knew we were
gonna hang out.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.711
What the fuck is this?

40:48.713 --> 40:50.013
What, man?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.681
It's fucking skankweed.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.517
So? You'll still catch a buzz.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.486
Give me a break.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.588
Oh, Jesus!

40:58.590 --> 41:00.657
Well, well, well.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.193
There you are,
you fucking worm.

41:03.195 --> 41:05.228
Been looking all over for you.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.529
Hubs, man, it's cool.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.831
No, it ain't cool!

41:07.833 --> 41:09.499
Come here.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.070
Let me tell you somethin'.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.738
Joe does not ditch hubbs

41:15.740 --> 41:17.707
or hubbs might have
to kick Joe's ass.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.843
What could I do, man?

41:19.845 --> 41:21.010
She was all over me.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.246
Yeah, I can see that.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.948
You're blowing it!
She ain't even naked.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.250
Hubbs, man, you don't
just jump right in there.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.219
You gotta get to know
a chick a little bit.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.254
What did I tell you, man?
You're thinkin' too much.

41:31.256 --> 41:34.157
Let me show you how it's done.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.603
Come here.

41:46.605 --> 41:47.670
Ha ha. What?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.906
I want to tell you somethin'.

41:51.243 --> 41:52.876
Ha ha ha ha!

41:54.112 --> 41:56.513
Damn it, you asshole.

42:24.976 --> 42:25.975
Whoo!

42:25.977 --> 42:27.277
Hey, what you doin'?

42:27.279 --> 42:29.279
Ooh ooh hah hah.

42:29.281 --> 42:31.781
What's his problem?

42:31.783 --> 42:34.183
Don't fuck around, Joe.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.652
Ooh ooh hah hah.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.887
Whoo! Waa!

42:37.889 --> 42:40.590
Whoo! Ooh ooh hah hah.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.859
Ooh ooh ooh hah.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.295
Ooh ooh ooh ooh!

42:45.297 --> 42:48.565
Whoo! Whoo!

42:51.269 --> 42:54.270
Whoo! Whoo! Hey!

42:54.272 --> 42:57.240
Shit, man, we're busted.
Let's book.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.308
What about our stuff?

42:58.310 --> 43:00.109
I'll get it.

43:02.347 --> 43:03.813
Punks!

43:09.821 --> 43:12.322
Come on, punk!

43:12.324 --> 43:14.357
Whoa!

43:14.359 --> 43:16.092
Banzai, motherfucker!

43:16.094 --> 43:17.660
Whoo!

43:22.167 --> 43:23.800
Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!

43:23.802 --> 43:25.335
Get in here, Joe!

43:25.337 --> 43:26.302
Ha ha!

43:29.674 --> 43:32.375
Man, you're gonna add, Joe.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.011
Lanie, what did you guys do?

43:35.013 --> 43:36.079
Nothing.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.618
That was wild.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.186
What can I say?

43:43.188 --> 43:44.887
Thanks.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.374
Hey, babe.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.075
What are you doing?

44:06.077 --> 44:07.377
What's goin' on?

44:07.379 --> 44:10.079
I'm going to change, all right?

44:10.081 --> 44:11.381
Hey, that's cool.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.049
Uh, do you want something?

44:13.051 --> 44:15.051
Well, yeah. Let's go for it.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.352
I don't think so.

44:16.354 --> 44:19.389
I thought we had somethin'
goin' back there.

44:19.391 --> 44:21.090
Yeah? When was that?

44:21.092 --> 44:22.392
You know, back there.

44:22.394 --> 44:24.093
Oh, yeah, and then what?

44:24.095 --> 44:25.395
You know. Come on.

44:25.397 --> 44:26.396
Lay off!

44:26.398 --> 44:27.664
What did I do?

44:27.666 --> 44:29.098
Keep your hands off me.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.800
All right! Shit!

44:30.802 --> 44:32.702
Aw, shit, man! Ow!

44:32.704 --> 44:34.771
Don't touch me again,
all right?

44:34.773 --> 44:37.206
All right, all right.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.676
What's going on?

44:39.678 --> 44:42.045
Damn. You kicked his ass.

44:42.047 --> 44:43.846
Wouldn't keep his hands off me.

44:45.417 --> 44:47.316
All right, Joe.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.397
You all probably think
I'm a real butthead.

45:01.399 --> 45:05.968
<i>Listen, you think I didn't want</i>
<i>to drink a bunch of beer</i>

45:05.970 --> 45:08.471
<i>and piss in somebody's pool</i>
<i>when I was your age?</i>

45:08.473 --> 45:11.107
Hell...

45:11.109 --> 45:15.845
They used to call me
"quick-dick Dean."

45:15.847 --> 45:19.482
Anyhow, I'm gonna let
you guys slide this time...

45:19.484 --> 45:21.951
But you guys
stay out of trouble...

45:23.188 --> 45:25.822
Yeah.

45:25.824 --> 45:29.092
We're all clear here. Let's go.

45:29.094 --> 45:31.761
Pigs are rippin'
the keg we scammed.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.863
They never have to buy
their own beer.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.431
They just rob us blind.

45:35.433 --> 45:36.799
Pigs.

45:36.801 --> 45:38.968
Fuck you.

45:38.970 --> 45:40.436
Hey, dudes,

45:40.438 --> 45:43.906
hubbs and connoly are at
that house with them chicks.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.308
We gotta head down there.

45:45.310 --> 45:47.443
Crump's brother's chicks?

45:47.445 --> 45:48.811
Trippin', tack?

45:48.813 --> 45:50.113
He ain't even around.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.881
All we need is some ox-45

45:51.883 --> 45:53.850
and that chick is ours.

45:53.852 --> 45:54.817
Chick?

45:54.819 --> 45:56.152
Hey, is she fine?

45:56.154 --> 45:57.153
Oh, yeah.

45:57.155 --> 45:58.821
Looks like that chick

45:58.823 --> 46:00.857
from the virgin killers album.

46:00.859 --> 46:02.325
Yeah!

46:16.407 --> 46:17.406
<i>Hey!</i>

46:18.409 --> 46:19.776
<i>Uhh!</i>

46:29.053 --> 46:30.820
I swear.

46:30.822 --> 46:33.256
I heard desiree Gibson
was doin' amateur night.

46:33.258 --> 46:35.491
Who the fuck told you
that shit again?

46:39.130 --> 46:40.096
Hey...

46:40.098 --> 46:42.398
Get off those, dude.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.800
Ha ha ha ha.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.369
Give me that thing.

46:48.540 --> 46:51.073
Don't flightless
seabirds turn you on?

46:51.075 --> 46:53.109
Not really.

46:56.514 --> 46:59.382
Whoa.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.537
<i>I'm so sick of this bullshit.</i>

47:21.539 --> 47:25.041
Why don't you go get your
butt buddy and split?

47:25.043 --> 47:28.144
No. I'm gonna wait it out, man.

47:29.581 --> 47:31.547
God damn it, I'm serious.

47:31.549 --> 47:34.383
I'm gonna tell my dad's
neighbor to kick you out.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.018
You wouldn't do that.

47:38.022 --> 47:39.121
Try me.

47:56.140 --> 47:57.640
Ahem.

47:57.642 --> 48:00.943
Oh, yeah... Ooh.

48:08.987 --> 48:10.253
Hubbs?

48:15.059 --> 48:16.125
Hubbs...

48:16.127 --> 48:18.027
Fuck, Joe.

48:18.029 --> 48:19.562
What's he doing here?

48:19.564 --> 48:21.330
He was just splittin', man.

48:25.637 --> 48:27.270
The guy's a perv.

48:27.272 --> 48:29.138
<i>Fuck.</i>

48:32.243 --> 48:34.277
So, what's goin' on, Joe?

48:34.279 --> 48:37.113
That other chick,
she wants us to split.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.547
So?

48:38.549 --> 48:41.017
So, she's really pissed.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.520
Look, man, you had your chance.

48:44.522 --> 48:47.523
You blew it.
Now you gotta pay the price.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.358
You gotta jump on the grenade.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.127
She's all over my case.

48:51.129 --> 48:53.162
Deal with it, man. Come on.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.363
I thought you were my bro.

48:54.365 --> 48:56.632
<i>I'd do the same for you, man.</i>

48:58.937 --> 49:00.369
This'll take the edge off.

49:02.674 --> 49:05.141
Come on, Joe,
I won't say nothin'.

49:05.143 --> 49:07.343
You're just a victim
of circumstance, man.

49:07.345 --> 49:08.544
Yeah, whatever.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.513
Bye.

49:11.683 --> 49:13.215
Yeah...

49:13.217 --> 49:14.550
Later.

49:23.261 --> 49:24.493
Shit.

49:29.701 --> 49:32.501
<i>Hey, Jill! Wait up!</i>

49:35.239 --> 49:36.672
Jill.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.279
Come on, tack, man.

49:43.281 --> 49:44.480
<i>I'm scared.</i>

49:44.482 --> 49:46.582
It's a long way down.

49:46.584 --> 49:49.385
Shut up and go for it, snotrag.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.587
Yeah, snotrag! Yeah, snotrag!

49:51.589 --> 49:53.656
Hey, don't call me that.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.324
Go! Go! Go!

49:56.661 --> 49:59.161
No contact, please, tack!

50:00.298 --> 50:01.297
Aah!

50:05.536 --> 50:08.337
Move your ass, snotrag!

50:11.409 --> 50:13.743
All right!

50:13.745 --> 50:14.744
Hey, man.

50:14.746 --> 50:16.278
These ain't talls.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.180
No shit!

50:18.182 --> 50:21.450
What the fuck!
Get us some talls!

50:21.452 --> 50:22.785
All right!

50:22.787 --> 50:25.154
He doesn't get out much,
does he?

50:25.156 --> 50:26.455
No shit.

50:26.457 --> 50:29.025
That's more like it.

50:42.073 --> 50:44.106
Hey, Jill, wait up.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.045
What do you want?

50:49.047 --> 50:52.615
Just thought
you might want this.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.617
No, thanks.

50:55.820 --> 50:56.819
Hey, come on.

50:56.821 --> 50:58.187
Shit!

50:58.189 --> 51:00.423
Oh! Leave me alone.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.065
Oh.

51:11.836 --> 51:13.502
You gonna be all right?

51:13.504 --> 51:16.839
I really didn't need
my nards anyway.

51:16.841 --> 51:19.542
Why don't you lighten up?

51:19.544 --> 51:22.311
What, so you can try
to get me drunk

51:22.313 --> 51:23.846
and jump my bones?

51:23.848 --> 51:25.815
Give me a break, stud boy.

51:25.817 --> 51:28.084
You're really not my type.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.559
Hey.

51:36.561 --> 51:38.461
I'm not tryin'
to pick up on you.

51:38.463 --> 51:41.163
I'm just doin' what I gotta do.

51:41.165 --> 51:42.465
Yeah, I get it.

51:42.467 --> 51:44.500
Just jumpin' on
the grenade, right?

51:44.502 --> 51:46.869
Man, I always get stuck

51:46.871 --> 51:49.238
with lanie's sorry-ass rejects.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.807
What did hubbs do

51:51.809 --> 51:54.143
that was so brilliant
that he should get laid?

51:54.145 --> 51:55.544
I don't know.

51:55.546 --> 51:58.147
Lanie kind of goes
for the dangerous type.

51:58.149 --> 52:00.483
What... I'm not dangerous?

52:00.485 --> 52:01.617
Shit!

52:04.155 --> 52:05.421
Shit!

52:05.423 --> 52:06.822
<i>I don't know about dangerous.</i>

52:06.824 --> 52:09.425
I think you're more
the hazardous type.

52:20.371 --> 52:23.506
So you think hubbs
is dangerous?

52:23.508 --> 52:26.208
I mean, you'd go for him?

52:26.210 --> 52:27.676
Hell, no.

52:27.678 --> 52:30.146
The guy's so obnoxious.

52:31.182 --> 52:33.315
Why do you like lanie anyway?

52:33.317 --> 52:34.650
I think...

52:34.652 --> 52:37.319
She's got, like,
a great personality.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.688
Oh, that's a new one.

52:39.690 --> 52:41.857
You're just jealous.

52:41.859 --> 52:43.726
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

52:43.728 --> 52:48.297
Like I want a bunch of
burnouts wantin' to pork me.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.266
It's just so lame.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.901
I mean, you went for it.

52:51.903 --> 52:53.903
You snooze, you lose.

52:53.905 --> 52:55.437
If I didn't go for it,

52:55.439 --> 52:57.339
hubbs would be all over her...

52:57.341 --> 52:58.908
like he isn't already.

52:58.910 --> 53:01.710
Or tack or some other dude.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.646
That's a good excuse.

53:03.648 --> 53:05.481
<i>Do it 'cause</i>
<i>everybody else does.</i>

53:05.483 --> 53:08.250
How typical.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.962
<i>Alcohol!</i>

53:52.964 --> 53:56.632
Alcohol! Alcohol!

53:56.634 --> 54:00.402
Alcohol! Alcohol!

54:00.404 --> 54:02.638
<i>Alcohol! Alcohol!</i>

54:02.640 --> 54:04.306
What's goin' on?

54:04.308 --> 54:07.009
Alcohol! Alcohol!

54:07.011 --> 54:09.278
Alcohol! Alcohol!

54:09.280 --> 54:10.879
Who <i> are</i> those guys?

54:10.881 --> 54:11.880
<i>Alcohol! Alcohol!</i>

54:11.882 --> 54:13.015
Just some dudes.

54:13.017 --> 54:15.384
Hey, you chicks, let us in!

54:15.386 --> 54:17.519
Alcohol! Alcohol!

54:17.521 --> 54:19.255
They'll split soon.

54:19.257 --> 54:21.657
Right.

54:21.659 --> 54:24.927
Alcohol! Alcohol!

54:24.929 --> 54:26.462
Alc... alc...

54:26.464 --> 54:28.297

54:28.299 --> 54:30.032
Hey, bitch!

54:30.034 --> 54:31.600
Ow!

54:32.737 --> 54:34.003
What do you want?

54:34.005 --> 54:35.971
We came back to party.

54:35.973 --> 54:39.642
Here are my buds, Mike
dick and Mike New York.

54:39.644 --> 54:40.843
You from New York?

54:44.048 --> 54:45.831
No.

54:45.832 --> 54:47.615
What is this, a meeting
of the mentally gifted minors?

54:47.618 --> 54:48.917
Huh? Huh?

54:48.919 --> 54:50.819
What?

54:50.821 --> 54:52.321
We got alcohol, man.

54:52.323 --> 54:53.322
Yeah!

54:53.324 --> 54:54.890
Must be my birthday.

54:54.892 --> 54:57.459
She doesn't look like
that chick

54:57.461 --> 54:58.794
on the virgin killers album.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.062
<i>Yeah, tack.</i>

55:00.064 --> 55:02.598
Yeah, this one's hogly.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.866
Yeah! Yeah!

55:05.069 --> 55:07.469
Hey, man, the other one's
the foxy one.

55:07.471 --> 55:09.571
Huh?

55:09.573 --> 55:11.540
Hey, so where's your friend?

55:11.542 --> 55:13.375
What, you guys want
to take a number?

55:13.377 --> 55:14.610
Yeah. Yeah.

55:14.612 --> 55:15.611
Yeah! Yeah!

55:15.613 --> 55:16.979
Whoo! Whoo!

55:21.619 --> 55:23.385
Hey! Ow!

55:23.387 --> 55:25.688
Watch it, man! Watch it!

55:25.690 --> 55:28.724
Fuckin' tack, man.
Shut up, dude!

55:28.726 --> 55:31.093
Hey, worm, I was hopin'
I'd run into you.

55:31.095 --> 55:32.761
Why you gotta be
such a dick, man?

55:32.763 --> 55:35.497
You can have the oinker.

55:35.499 --> 55:37.366
Where's the other one?

55:37.368 --> 55:40.469
Don't say that.
I mean, she's pretty fine.

55:40.471 --> 55:41.970
Not even, man.

55:41.972 --> 55:43.605
She's a fuckin' fat-ass.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.342
Come on, man.

55:46.344 --> 55:49.345
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

55:49.347 --> 55:51.480
<i>I don't know, man.</i>

55:51.482 --> 55:52.915
Fuckin' Joe, man.

55:52.917 --> 55:55.751
You wormed me out of my chicks.

55:55.753 --> 55:58.087
I'm sorry about that, dude,

55:58.089 --> 55:59.822
but you guys are fucking dicks.

55:59.824 --> 56:01.924
You think the chick's
gonna go for it

56:01.926 --> 56:03.625
because you got some ox-45?

56:03.627 --> 56:06.829
These are talls, man.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.097
Yeah!

56:08.099 --> 56:09.732
Big shit.

56:09.734 --> 56:12.101
Why don't you asswipes
go back to orange county?

56:12.103 --> 56:14.436
Hey, fuck you!

56:14.438 --> 56:16.004
<i>We come all the way here...</i>

56:16.006 --> 56:19.541
Looks like connoly doesn't have

56:19.543 --> 56:22.578
his butt buddy house friend
anymore to save his ass.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.980
Tack, man, don't fuck around.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.449
I hate worms.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.689
Fuck, man!

56:37.795 --> 56:39.461
I hate worms!

56:39.463 --> 56:41.530
No shit, man!
Kick his ass, tack!

56:41.532 --> 56:44.166
Let's see you
talk big now, connoly.

56:44.168 --> 56:46.402
Fuck you, man!

56:52.143 --> 56:54.443
Fuckin', tack!
What's your problem?

56:54.445 --> 56:56.545
Like you're the one
to talk, Joe.

56:56.547 --> 56:57.813
You're the worm.

56:57.815 --> 56:59.715
They ain't your chicks anyway.

56:59.717 --> 57:01.150
You don't have
to talk shit to 'em.

57:01.152 --> 57:04.453
Fuck you, man. I gotta get
laid like any other dude.

57:04.455 --> 57:06.688
You don't have to be
such a dick, man.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.457
What happened to you, tack?

57:08.459 --> 57:09.825
You used to be
an all-right dude.

57:09.827 --> 57:13.462
Fine chicks
don't even talk to me.

57:13.464 --> 57:16.565
They all think I'm gross.

57:16.567 --> 57:19.802
You think fine chicks
wanna talk to a crater face?

57:19.804 --> 57:21.837
Hey, man,

57:21.839 --> 57:23.705
your face'll clear up after a
while.

57:23.707 --> 57:27.075
What, am I supposed to wait
till I'm 30 to get laid?

57:27.077 --> 57:28.510
Well...

57:28.512 --> 57:30.179
Maybe you can meet a chick

57:30.181 --> 57:31.880
with an acne problem, too.

57:31.882 --> 57:33.449
You guys will have something in
common.

57:33.451 --> 57:36.185
Fuck you, man! I don't
want no chick with zits.

57:36.187 --> 57:37.453
I want fine chicks.

57:37.455 --> 57:38.854
Shit!

57:38.856 --> 57:40.055
Oh!

57:40.057 --> 57:41.723
Jill, let me in!

57:41.725 --> 57:43.025
Get him!

57:46.864 --> 57:48.997
You gotta come out
sometime, worm.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.678
Looks like those shitheads
messed you up pretty good.

58:04.548 --> 58:06.215
Want some ice for that?

58:06.217 --> 58:07.816
No. No.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.051
No, I'm fine.

58:27.171 --> 58:29.204
I told you, deck him, snotrag.

58:29.206 --> 58:31.707
Hey, don't call me that.

58:31.709 --> 58:34.776
Looks like those dicks
are plannin' to stay a while.

58:58.035 --> 59:00.702
So you wouldn't throw me
out of bed, huh?

59:00.704 --> 59:02.271
Am I supposed to be flattered?

59:02.273 --> 59:06.275
I was sayin' that to get
those dicks to shut up.

59:06.277 --> 59:08.277
Well...

59:08.279 --> 59:12.114
I guess you can hang
out till they split.

59:12.116 --> 59:14.683
Cool.

59:14.685 --> 59:19.288
I wouldn't mix that with
that peppermint schnapps.

59:19.290 --> 59:20.589
I can handle it.

59:26.297 --> 59:27.829
Oh!

59:27.831 --> 59:28.830
Yes.

59:28.832 --> 59:29.831
Ohh!

59:29.833 --> 59:30.832
Ohh!

59:30.834 --> 59:32.968
Ohh! Aah!

59:32.970 --> 59:35.103
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

59:36.807 --> 59:38.807
Shit. I wish we had
some dope or something.

59:38.809 --> 59:40.576
I got some lumbo.

59:40.578 --> 59:44.713
Actually, it's, uh, skankweed,

59:44.715 --> 59:46.315
but if you want
to fire it up...

59:46.317 --> 59:48.317
Sure.

59:48.319 --> 59:51.987
So, where you guys from
up north?

59:51.989 --> 59:53.655
San Jose.

59:53.657 --> 59:55.090
Go for it.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:04.600
Tastes like shit.

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:14.209
Damn brother sold me this shit.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.879
He told me it was lumbo.

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:20.215
So what do you do up there?

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.384
Just party... School.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:24.953
It's pretty boring, actually.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.359
What about you?
You go to school?

01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:32.394
Mm-hmm.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.963
I'll be a senior next year.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.632
Yeah, me, too.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:38.700
I'll be out of that zoo.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.973
What are you gonna do?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.375
I want to go to england

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:48.043
on an exchange student thing.

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.980
They have a cool lit program
I want to check out.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.882
I would have gone this summer,

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.350
but my dad wouldn't let me.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.152
He thinks I'm a failure

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:01.056
ever since I didn't make
cheerleader team in seventh grade.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.025
Cheerleaders...

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:05.761
I don't even think we have
cheerleaders at my school.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:08.263
Everybody's too busy
gettin' stoned.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:11.033
That's true at my school, too.

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:15.070
So, you, uh, catchin' a
buzz off of that thing?

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:18.073
Yeah... I think so.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.675
You?

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.744
My head hurts.

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:26.982
I gotta take a dump.

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:04.786
It's worm!

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.875
Hold on!

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:00.235
I dig this song.

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:03.205
Same here.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:06.241
Hubbs says it's a pussy song.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.509
Well...

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.211
It is, kinda.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.913
I mean, it's a love song,

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.115
and it doesn't even have
the word poontang in it.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.584
Yeah.

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:17.319
But I mean...

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.487
It's, like, there's something
more to it, you know?

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:24.226
Hey, Joe. Hmm?

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.961
What's all that bullshit
you talk

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:28.463
about gettin' hit by a laser

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.298
at that blue oyster cult show

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.468
and then...
Seeing that big eyeball?

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:37.239
What can I say? It really...
it really happened.

01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:38.640
Oh, yeah?

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:40.342
Maybe you should
lay off the dope.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:44.145
I don't know, man. It's
just when I saw that thing,

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:45.614
it made me start to think

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:48.917
that maybe there's
something more out there.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.352
And, you know,

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:53.488
that maybe there's
somethin' watchin' me.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.258
You are such a weirdo...

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.961
But at least you got
something going on upstairs.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:01.329
Sorry I can't say the same

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.598
for those dicks you
hang around with.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.634
Yeah.

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:08.536
You're a pretty smart chick.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:18.346
Eww! What's that smell?

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:21.182
Don't ask me, man.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:25.320
Who's mondo man?

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.988
Oh...

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.991
He's just this
weird dude up north.

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:31.927
He's kind of cool, actually.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.998
Hey, Joe? Hmm?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.001
Do you think I have a fat ass?

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:42.003
No, man.

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:44.506
Don't worry about it.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.175
<i>Joe!</i>

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:49.344
<i>Joe, come here, dude.</i>

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:51.346
Come here, dude.

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:52.647
What?

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.382
Get your ass up here, man!

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:07.429
Get up here, man.

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:09.464
I feel bad about what happened,

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.100
so I talked to lanie.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.368
Yeah?

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.437
I told her it was
your birthday, man,

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.139
and she's gonna
give you a blow job.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.674
She went for that bullshit?

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:22.143
Not really, but I told
her you're fucked up

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.446
'cause your dad used to
kick your ass all the time,

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.481
and she went for it.
Fuck, right on.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.450
What's goin' on out here?

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.085
Nothin'. We're just
hangin' out.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.420
<i>You don't even have</i>
<i>her shirt off.</i>

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.089
<i>We're just talkin', man.</i>

01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:36.591
You put on that pussy shit?

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.094
What the fuck is this?
Don't worry.

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.096
You're blowin' it out here.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:43.665
Get in there. She's killer.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.191
<i>B.O.C. B.O.C.</i>

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.393
<i>B.O.C. B.O.C.</i>

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.761
<i>B.O.C. B.O.C.</i>

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:14.095
<i>B.O.C.</i>

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.296
<i>B.O.C.</i>

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:16.464
<i>B.O.C.</i>

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.299
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:20.301
<i>Whoo-ooo-ooo!</i>

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:28.610
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.512
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:23.685
Fuck, man. Hubbs.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:26.621
Hey, man.

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:30.592
Uh, really, you won't
say nothin', will you?

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:32.727
Lay off of her, man.
She's not like that.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.964
What are you
talkin' about, man?

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.899
She was all over me.

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:45.974
Mmm.

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.976
<i>Hey!</i>

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:52.313
<i>Get back! Look out. He's here.</i>

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:56.584
What are you lookin' at?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.019
Oh, hey, bro.

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.321
Joe and hubbs, they're up
there with them chicks.

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:02.790
Hubbs! Shit, man,
it's crump's brother!

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:05.260
No way, dude.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:07.262
<i>What the fuck you been?</i>

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.363
Fuckin' party?

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:09.497
Get that...

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:10.865
shit. Who's crump's brother?

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.433
He's just some dude.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.736
I knew we shouldn't
have wormed his chicks.

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.771
What do you mean, "his chicks"?

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.740
Well, he saw you first,

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.508
so technically,
you're his chicks.

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:21.476
What?

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:24.712
...crack ass, motherfucker.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:27.048
I've never seen
that guy before in my life.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.783
Doesn't matter. <i>He</i> saw you.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.452
What are you worried about?
We were here first.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.388
<i>Hey!</i> These are our chicks.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:35.723
This is bullshit.

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.292
Hey!

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:39.394
Hey, you fuckin' worms,
let me have my chicks!

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:40.461
Get back!

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.863
<i>Hey!</i>

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.932
He's totally thrashing the door.
Tell him to leave.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.567
Won't be that easy.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:49.037
Let's book.

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.938
What? You're can't
just leave us here?

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.507
Sorry, babe,
you know how it is.

01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:53.975
Man, we gotta hang.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.843
You want to get
your ass kicked?

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.346
We can't leave these
chicks to crump's brother.

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.547
<i>Fuckin' door!</i>

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.050
Hey!

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.985
<i>Hey!</i>

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.320
Shit!

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.424
Fuck.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:11.592
Ow! Aah! Damn it!

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:14.829
<i>Fuckin' assholes!</i>

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.331
Whoa!

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.598
Aah!

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.535
Fuckin' worms!
Let me have my chicks!

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.337
Shit, man!

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:24.339
Come on, you fuckin' assholes!

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.374
God damn it! Come here!

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:29.811
Let go! No chicks in here, bro!

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:31.679
I ain't your fuckin'
bro, asswipe!

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.348
Aah! J-Joe!

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.016
Yaaah!

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.351
Aah!

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:43.725
Now you've fuckin'
pissed me off!

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:47.362
<i>Hey, you worms, I'm gonna
kick your fuckin' ass!</i>

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:49.831
Oh, fuck, man. <i>You hear me?</i>

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.866
Crump's brother's
gonna kick our ass.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.868
This is bullshit.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.837
<i>Worms!</i>

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:58.539
Guess we kinda
got it comin', man.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.842
I guess that's where it is.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:05.546
It was worth it,
though, huh, dude?

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.882
That chick was killer.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.922
Uh, yeah. What?

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.596
Oh, don't tell me, man.

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:23.898
You blew it?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.900
You didn't go for it?

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:32.440
Wasn't like that, man.

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:35.443
I should kick your ass myself.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.713
Don't worry about it.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.719
<i>Ohhh! Ooh!</i>

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:46.421
What's going on, man?

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:47.588
<i>Oh!</i>

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.063
<i>Aah!</i>

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:58.933
<i>Ooh!</i>

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.469
<i>Aah!</i>

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.671
Whoa! Some old dude's
out there kickin' ass!

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.139
Uuh! Oh!

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.140
Oh! Ahh!

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:08.743
He's floored crump's brother.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:10.645
Oh!

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:11.646
Oh!

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:14.182
He's going for tack!

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:16.150
He's gonna pound his nards!

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:20.087
Oh! Oh!

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.589
Whoo! Whoo!

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.692
Oh, shit.

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.029
Daddy.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:31.032
What the hell is
going on around here?

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:34.168
What are you doing
with my daughter?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.970
Hey, man, these are our chicks.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.572
Your chicks?

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:39.574
Daddy... Nothing happened.

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.609
We were about to split, man.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:47.215
What's going on?

01:14:47.217 --> 01:14:48.716
Nothing happened, huh?

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:50.585
Lanie, what did these
guys do to you?

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.687
Nothing...

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:55.223
Nothing happened. She
didn't even give me head.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.592
What?

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:58.926
Let's book, Joe. Shit!

01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:00.094
Whoa!

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:03.664
Daddy, let him go! Daddy!

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.666
Ow! Ow! Man, ow!

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.869
Lay off! Whoa!

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.978
Ohhh... Uh! Ooh!

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.814
Get up, you little punk. Shit.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:22.650
<i>Let go, man! Let me go!</i>
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:25.653
<i>Come on, man!</i> Fuckin' Joe.

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.021
Oh!

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.222
Shit, man!

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:30.992
What'd I do, man?

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:33.694
How about you tell
me, huh, buddy?

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.696
Shit, man.
Nothin' happened, man!

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.298
Nothin' happened,
you lying fink?

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.034
You ought to learn not to mess
with another guy's girls!

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.704
Come on, let me go, man!

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.673
You're not goin' nowhere, kid.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.279
Whoa!

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:53.915
Ooh!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.786
Ohhh...

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.922
Get up!

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.694
Unh!

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:08.262
Oh, man. Unh...

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:16.103
Operator, give me the police.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:18.005
Daddy, you don't have
to call the cops.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:20.241
Shut up. Just shut your mouth!

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.009
<i>You're in enough trouble as is.</i>

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:25.279
Should've known better
than to trust you.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:28.716
Officer, I'm in the corner
house on ocean and rose.

01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:31.852
I got a young punk
I caught trespassing.

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:33.955
We might get him
on a sex offense.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:36.090
I didn't do nothin'.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.693
<i>Daddy, it wasn't his fault. He
kept those guys out of the house.</i>

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:41.195
Yes, I'll keep him here
until you arrive.

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:43.898
There's a bunch of other
hoodlums hangin' around.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.232
What's your buddy's name?

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:46.634
I'm not gonna narc.

01:16:46.636 --> 01:16:48.769
He's not talking.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:52.640
I'm sure he'll crack once
you get him downtown.

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:56.844
Yeah, it's across the way from
that Frankie avalon place?

01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:58.245
Right.

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:04.185
Just stay put.

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:44.759
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:54.835
Jill, I'm very
disappointed in you.

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.837
<i>What is it with you kids?</i>

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.599
<i>What do you see in punks
like that, anyway?</i>

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:02.677
So you're not the prettiest
girl around town.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.779
<i>You should be able to
attract something better</i>

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.114
<i>than trash like this.</i>

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:09.183
And you, lanie...

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:12.353
<i>Oh, you can have it all.</i>

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:14.188
It just breaks my heart

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.991
to see you give it away
like some... Tramp.

01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:19.093
Shut up, Warren.

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:20.428
What about that bikini?

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.130
What? What was that?

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.066
I said what about that
bikini you bought her

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:27.802
so you could watch her by the
pool and sport wood, man.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:29.770
Yeah, Warren.

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:31.439
Hey, those were real
puka shells!

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:32.973
That was the only reason I...

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:37.078
better stay out of this,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.813
<i>you longhaired punk.</i>

01:18:38.815 --> 01:18:41.415
Somebody ought to teach you
respect for your elders.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.451
Respect?

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:45.386
This is all bullshit, man!

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:48.055
You think Jill should be some
airheaded cheerleader, man!

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:51.158
Fuck, the chick's smart.
You treat her like shit.

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:54.462
You're worse than
fuckin' tack, man.

01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:56.263
Who the hell is tack?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.034
Just some dude.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:02.303
Hey, don't turn this
around on me!

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:04.472
Where do you kids get it
in your head to this way?

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:06.474
Where do you get your values?

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:09.410
From that stinking heavy metal
music you're always playing.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:11.979
That's it, man. It's the music.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:14.849
Everything's just fine until we
listen to some heavy metal albums.

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:16.350
Then we get all fucked up.

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:18.819
I've had enough of you.

01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:21.756
You'll have a lot of
time to think about that

01:19:21.758 --> 01:19:23.958
when you're locked away
in juvenile hall.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.194
Whatever, man. Send me to juvie.
I don't give a fuck.

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:28.829
Just leave these chicks alone.

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:30.898
They're just tryin'
to have a good time.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.933
Right on! Ow!

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:36.904
Let go, man! Let... Me...

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:39.306
Aah!

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:42.309
All right, hubbs!
Go for it, dude!

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:43.944
Later, bro.

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:48.482
Waaaohh! Wahhh-ho!

01:19:55.525 --> 01:19:57.558
Good night.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.426
Tack, you kack.

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:02.196
Fuck you, you fuckin' worm.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:30.825
Hey. Hey, Joe. Joe.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.961
What the hell you doin' here?

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:36.096
I don't know. I didn't
want you to split.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:38.065
Couldn't stick around
and get popped.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.901
I told you my dad's
such an asshole.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:43.037
<i>Wretched hooligans...</i>

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.339
Assume the prone position.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.574
Do not attempt to run.

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:48.342
<i>Repeat...</i>

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.444
I should probably go.
Hey, you know, I...

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.847
I might come back
down here sometime.

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:55.115
I thought maybe we could
party or something?

01:20:55.117 --> 01:20:57.551
Yeah. Um...

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:00.454
Could... I'll call you.
What's your last name.

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:03.157
Wazukwakwicz. It's in the book.

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:06.093
Wazukwakwicz. Cool, man.

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:10.397
Joe? Why didn't you
fuckin' go for me?

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:11.999
I was workin' up to it.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:14.869
You snooze, you lose, huh?

01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:32.653
Hey, Joe...

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:35.990
what the fuck, man, you want
to get busted? Let's go!

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.359
Later, Joe.

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:43.297
Joe! Move your ass!

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:57.044
You kids probably think
I'm a real butthead.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:22:00.047
You think I didn't want to
sneak into some girl's house

01:22:00.049 --> 01:22:02.416
when I was your age?

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.652
Hell, they used to call me

01:22:04.654 --> 01:22:06.220
<i>"doggie-door Dean."</i>

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:10.491
<i>I was a good</i>
<i>second-floor man, too.</i>

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:13.494
Let's book, man, before
those pigs nab us.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:15.930
Hey, you guys.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:18.666
Where's the party?

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:21.235
Just over there, man.

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.537
You walk straight ahead,
you can't miss it.

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:25.539
Well...

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.374
Where's the other one?

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:30.044
You know how it is.

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:32.947
She was messing up the ratio.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:53.968
Check it out, man.
Excuse me, guys...

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:55.703
Could you tell me
where the, uh...

01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:58.172
Frankie avalon house is?

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:03.310
Uh, yeah. It's about two
blocks down there on the left.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:04.712
Great.

01:23:04.714 --> 01:23:08.716
I hear there's a shitload
of fine chicks down there.

01:23:08.718 --> 01:23:11.051
Go for it, dude.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.301
Oh, man.

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:31.271
Fuck.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.440
That was a perfect night, man.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:36.410
I got drunk and laid
by a rad chick.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.384
What was that back there, man?

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:44.752
What?

01:23:44.754 --> 01:23:48.756
How come you ain't jumpin'
on the grenade no more?

01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:51.658
Don't worry about it, man.

01:23:57.466 --> 01:24:01.702
Fuck. I got to get that
chick's phone number, man.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.608
How'd you spell
wazukwakwicz, anyway?

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:10.577
What, are you gonna
fucking call her, man?

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:12.780
That's the whole point.
She's from up north.

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:15.416
You don't have to
deal with her again.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.451
You didn't even
pork her, thank God.

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:20.387
Hubbs, man,

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.189
you just don't get it,
do you, man?

01:24:22.191 --> 01:24:24.258
Man, I was diggin'
on that chick.

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.694
What, does she have,
like, a good personality, man?

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:29.530
<i>Give me a break.</i>

01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:32.533
Ahh, you're thinkin'
too much, pussy.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.303
Hey, fuck you, man.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:39.573
Fuck me? Yeah! Fuck you!

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:42.543
Ow! Shit!

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:48.782
You want to get your ass kicked
over some fat-ass chick, man?

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:53.587
She's cool, man. Say it!
Say it! She's cool!

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:54.855
She's cool, man! Say it!

01:24:54.857 --> 01:24:56.557
Whatever, dude!

01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:58.659
Come on, say it,
man, she's cool!

01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:00.327
Fine! She's cool!

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:08.602
Damn, Joe.

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:12.372
You're weirdin' out on me, man.

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:40.400
<i>¶ All the times have gone ¶</i>
