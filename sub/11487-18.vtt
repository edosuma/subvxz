00:01.359 --> 00:04.352
Alan, l forgot my toothbrush.
Can l use yours?

00:04.520 --> 00:06.431
Oh, dear Lord, no.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.591
Do you have any idea
how many bacteria. . .

00:08.760 --> 00:10.637
. . .can be transferred
on a toothbrush?

00:10.800 --> 00:11.994
l don't know. How many?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.469
Okay, l don't know
the actual amount.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.756
Then why did you bring it up?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.473
Poor judgment.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.473
The point is, sharing these things
is a bad idea.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.677
Are you saying you don't want
your toothbrush in my mouth--?

00:25.840 --> 00:30.311
l know, l know.
l get the hypocrisy. Just humor me.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.519
Okay, l have hard,
medium or soft bristles.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.432
l have straight or curved handles.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.431
And for your flossing needs. . .

00:38.600 --> 00:41.797
. . .l have waxed, mint-waxed,
un-waxed.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.589
lf you're feeling especially adventurous,
may l suggest the cinnamon?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.077
Maybe l'll just wait till l get home.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.959
No, no. One day you skip brushing
and before you know it. . .

00:51.120 --> 00:54.430
. . .your teeth rot away and you're
begging strangers to start your apple.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.315
Fine. l'll take the pink one.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.712
l always wondered, what's
the rubber thing at the end for?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.074
lt's to massage your gums.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.710
Oh, l thought it might be an eraser.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.189
But who writes
when they're brushing their teeth?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.399
l don't know.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.189
What's the matter?

01:15.360 --> 01:18.033
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Well, l kind of have to pee.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.919
-Go ahead.
-Oh, no, l'll wait till you're finished.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.878
Are you shy about peeing
in front of me? Because, Alan--

01:24.040 --> 01:26.110
Again, l get the hypocrisy.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.951
l think it's important to keep
a little mystery in a relationship.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.348
lt's just peeing, Alan.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.999
Not necessarily.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.754
Sometimes when a man urinates. . .

01:35.920 --> 01:39.390
. . .other muscles see that
as a green light to relax.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.357
So you've never peed
in front of a girl?

01:41.520 --> 01:44.432
Well, my ex-wife, but after six,
seven years of marriage. . .

01:44.600 --> 01:46.033
. . .who gives a damn anymore?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.435
-Okay, l'll brush out here.
-Thank you.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.158
-What?
-One of my teeth hurts when l brush it.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.311
When was the last time
you saw a dentist?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.232
Alan, l see people all the time.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.039
They don't always tell you
what they do.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.868
Hey, are you done?
Because l gotta rinse.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.589
No, l can't go
when l know you're listening.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.513
Would it help if l sang
the pee-pee song?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.560
-The what?
-My mom used to sing it to me.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.794
Tinkle, tinkle, little star
In the potty not the car

02:24.960 --> 02:29.556
Up above the bowl so high
Like the raindrops in the sky

02:29.720 --> 02:32.029
Hey, hey, it's working.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.199
Green light.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.360 --> 02:50.794
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.155
-Should l try it again?
-Not yet.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.038
Okay, now.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.236
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.549
Morning.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.870
-Morning.
-Morning, Charlie.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.029
Need any help?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.434
Do you know how to get
a 1 981 Plymouth Duster moving?

03:05.600 --> 03:09.115
Yeah, yank out the eight track
and push it off a cliff.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.313
You're useless.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.112
Sorry.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.238
-You got a little grease on your face.
-Where?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.628
Cheek.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.669
Did l get it?

03:20.840 --> 03:21.875
No, other side.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.630
-Now?
-Little on your forehead.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.831
-Yeah?
-Perfect.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.991
Now sing ''Swanee River. ''

03:32.000 --> 03:33.956
Alan, should l try it again?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.599
No. l'm gonna call AAA.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.196
Good. No sense drinking over this.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.389
You must be so proud.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.552
Hey, she may not be sophisticated,
but she's street-smart.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.029
Sesame Street-smart.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.189
Just leave it alone.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.318
Let me ask you something.
Have you stopped to consider. . .

03:59.480 --> 04:02.438
. . .the long-term cost of a relationship
with a girl that young?

04:02.600 --> 04:03.874
Charlie, it's a free tow.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.032
Oh, sure. That's how it always starts,
with a free tow.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.589
But who's gonna pay to fix the car
after it's towed?

04:11.280 --> 04:14.750
''Um'' is right, my dim-witted friend.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.433
And that's just the beginning.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.591
Girls like Kandi need
all kinds of stuff. . .

04:18.760 --> 04:22.548
. . .the only way they can pay for it
is through horny morons like you.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.836
Her car breaks down
and l should just dump her?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.309
-This is a short-term relationship?
-l don't know.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.357
Trust me,
it's a short-term relationship.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.875
Kandi's not the brightest bulb
in the chandelier. . .

04:32.040 --> 04:33.632
. . .but even she's gonna wake up. . .

04:33.800 --> 04:36.633
. . .wonder what she's doing
shacked up with a penniless putz. . .

04:36.800 --> 04:37.869
. . .who's twice her age.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.075
Kandi's not like that.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.389
Just wait.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.632
Your first minor stroke and she'll be
boinking the cardiologist. . .

04:43.800 --> 04:46.872
. . .before you can scrawl
''What happened?'' on your note pad.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.632
Okay, for the sake of argument. . .

04:52.800 --> 04:55.030
. . .let's say you're right,
what's your point?

04:55.760 --> 04:58.957
My point is, you don't dry-clean
a rented tuxedo.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.792
You don't redecorate a hotel room.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.315
You don't order cable
for a port-a-potty. . .

05:03.480 --> 05:05.516
. . .unless you're really, really drunk.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.750
And you don't take
on the bills of a girl. . .

05:07.920 --> 05:11.390
. . .that's got the attention span of
a monkey chewing on a fly swatter.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.275
Okay, l appreciate your. . .

05:14.440 --> 05:17.989
. . .how shall l describe it,
compassionate advice. . .

05:18.160 --> 05:21.630
. . .but all l'm doing here
is arranging a free tow for a friend.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.955
Alan, l don't think
the engine's flooded anymore.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.349
-Fire extinguisher?
-Under the sink.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.476
Hey, if you don't hurry up,
you'll be late.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.629
l don't mind.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.631
Okay, well, that takes
the pressure off.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.950
How come my dad's not bringing me?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.953
-He's helping Kandi get her car fixed.
-Oh, jeez.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.317
And him already broker
than a headless hooker.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.391
Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.637
What gave you the idea
she hates her?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.791
Because she says so.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.229
A lot.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.031
All right. Why do you think?

06:08.680 --> 06:10.511
l don't know.
She's pretty, she's fun. . .

06:10.680 --> 06:12.636
. . .and Dad seems real happy with her.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.758
Well, little man, you just answered
your own question.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.433
l did? What'd l say?

06:19.160 --> 06:21.594
lt's like this.
You ever see a kid at school. . .

06:21.760 --> 06:24.558
. . .who doesn't like his lunch
but he won't let you have it?

06:24.720 --> 06:26.392
Oh, yeah, Russell Beasley.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.870
He'll spit on his apple cobbler
before he'll let anybody else eat it.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.396
This is pretty much the same deal,
except your mom is Russell Beasley. . .

06:33.560 --> 06:36.393
. . .and your dad
is the spit-covered cobbler.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.315
l don't understand.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.637
Though your mom
doesn't want your dad. . .

06:40.800 --> 06:43.109
. . .she doesn't want Kandi
to eat him either.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.758
You know,
l like cobbler with ice cream.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.436
Way to follow a train of thought.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.358
Thanks.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.351
Well, l guess we should go
to school now.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.317
Couldn't hurt.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.153
l'll see if l can find my books.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.349
Sweet kid.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.313
Yeah.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.552
Shame he'll never be anything
more than a burden to society.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.672
Do you know a good lawyer, Alan?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.035
No, but my ex-wife does.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.317
-Why?
-Because l wanna sue the guy. . .

07:20.480 --> 07:21.833
. . .who sold me that lemming.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.316
-You mean lemon.
-l do?

07:26.920 --> 07:28.433
Okay.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.510
Did you get any kind of a written
guarantee when you bought it?

07:32.680 --> 07:36.036
No, it was more of an oral agreement.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.559
All right, Mr. Harper,
l looked at your daughter's vehicle.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.438
She's not my daughter.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.109
Good for you.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.911
Anyway,
the prognosis looks rather bleak.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.674
-l understand.
-l mean, the vehicle was on fire.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.518
l know.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.795
What, is she like 21 ?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.276
-Twenty-two.
-And a half.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.239
Good for you.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.996
-Yeah, what about the car?
-Oh, the car?

08:09.160 --> 08:11.435
The cars gotta be 25, 26 years old.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.708
-l mean, can it be fixed?
-Anything can be fixed.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.599
Hell, they put a pig's heart
in my Uncle Vinnie.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.869
-How much?
-All of it.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.230
My Aunt Phyllis likes to call him
the other white meat now.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.230
No, l mean how much to fix the car?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.313
For you, three grand.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.794
What?

08:33.960 --> 08:36.918
Once again, the car was on fire.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.839
l had to wait an hour
before l could even touch it.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.831
But l only paid 800 for it.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.876
Eight hundred dollars?

08:44.039 --> 08:48.033
l hate to be the bearer of sad tidings,
but some business person. . .

08:48.200 --> 08:50.668
. . .has taken advantage
of your good nature.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.110
Boy, that happens a lot.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.957
Well, 3000 is out of the question.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.315
lt'd make more sense
just to get her a new car.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.879
Oh, Alan, thank you.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.396
That's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.878
Good for you.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.228
-Hi.
-Hey.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.398
Why isn't your car in the garage?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.630
l loaned it to Kandi.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.510
And how much are you paying
to fix hers?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.154
For your information, nothing.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.355
Nothing?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.589
Not a cent.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.269
l'm leasing her a Saturn.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.314
Tell me again about the free tow,
Alan.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.913
Come on, she needs a car. . .

09:35.080 --> 09:37.799
. . .and the lease terms
are surprisingly reasonable.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.996
They're practically giving them away.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.273
Excuse me.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.034
Where are you going?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.997
l'm gonna solve all your problems.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.908
Wanna see it coming
or should l surprise you?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.712
You're not funny.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.953
Hello?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.152
Hang on a second.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.235
lt's your dentist, he wants to talk
to you about Kandi's teeth.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.195
Thank you.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.675
Hi, Dr. Weinberger.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.876
Thanks for seeing her
on such short notice.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.998
Can l have some privacy, please?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.839
Sure, get your own place.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.111
No, she's not covered
under my dental plan.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.196
Twenty-two and a half.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.831
Yeah, yeah, good for me.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.271
Did you get a chance
to look at her tooth?

10:40.280 --> 10:43.158
Oh, a root canal.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.038
Well, how much is that?

10:48.880 --> 10:51.269
What do you mean there's more?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.439
Who told you
to look at her wisdom teeth?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.394
That girl's got wisdom teeth?

10:58.560 --> 11:00.835
Okay, what's the worst thing
that could happen. . .

11:01.000 --> 11:02.592
. . . if you don't take them out?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.631
How infected?

11:06.800 --> 11:10.839
All right, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.589
Yeah, send me the bill.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.237
Okay, bye-bye.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.429
Here.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.756
Aim for the cheap seats.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.516
Alan, what are you doing?

11:51.200 --> 11:53.998
You know,
a little bit of a cash-flow crunch. . .

11:54.160 --> 11:56.390
. . .and l thought l'd use this
to pay some bills.

11:56.960 --> 11:57.949
l see.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.718
Mind helping me out?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.469
Sure.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.274
Promise me you'll spend it on food,
not whiskey.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.271
My pain brings you
a lot of pleasure, huh?

12:18.440 --> 12:20.556
l'm a simple man.

12:26.840 --> 12:27.989
lt's your ex-wife.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.628
Oh, perfect. Get the bat.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.069
This is the bat.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.352
Hello?

12:37.520 --> 12:40.876
Oh, good. l was hoping it'd be you.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.072
Of course l remember the Alamo.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.752
Oh, you mean alimony.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.516
l was thinking Davy Crockett,
Jim Bowie.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.392
Oh, come on, Judith,
why can't we share a few chuckles?

12:59.160 --> 13:00.593
Oh, no, no, l agree.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.035
There's nothing chuckle-worthy
about a subpoena.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.512
Well, you know, l will tell you what.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.194
l will bring you the check
when l pick up Jake.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.799
l promise.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.678
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.512
You gotta pick up Jake.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.871
-Why?
-Because l don't have her money.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.634
lt's in Kandi's mouth and Kandi's car.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.360
What about The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre over there?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.233
This? This is nothing.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.675
One car payment
and maybe a bikini wax.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.956
-Bikini wax?
-A girl's gotta keep those up.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.917
lt's a landscaping issue.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.791
You just gotta buy me some time
with Judith.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.951
What are you gonna do
with more time?

13:39.120 --> 13:42.351
You can't sell your blood,
your ex-wife already took that.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.990
And if you sell your sperm,
what's the point in dating Kandi?

13:46.160 --> 13:49.197
Well, for your information,
l do have other options.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.238
-Like what?
-l've been looking at part-time work.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.789
And l have some very promising
auctions on eBay.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.394
Oh, really? What are you auctioning?

13:57.560 --> 14:01.030
Well, a few rare books,
a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.872
Since when do you play golf?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.355
Well, technically, they're your clubs.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.714
You're stealing from me?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.598
Oh, come on, you only bought them. . .

14:11.760 --> 14:14.593
. . .so you could go to Palm Springs
and pick up lesbians.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.669
This is ridiculous.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.070
Why don't you just ask me
to lend you some money?

14:21.240 --> 14:23.310
-Would you lend me money?
-Absolutely.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.914
lf l hadn't taken a bath
on the Super Bowl.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.154
Well, l need to do this by myself
anyway.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.992
You know, l still have my pride.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.593
Wow, you really think that, huh?

14:34.760 --> 14:38.753
Well, it doesn't matter
as long as l have Kandi.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.669
She looks up to me,
she thinks l'm special.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.829
She thinks l'm smart.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.152
She thinks gazpacho
is Pinocchio's father.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.232
What can l say, Charlie?
l'm crazy about her.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.477
All right, l certainly don't wanna
stand in the way of your happiness.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.517
Thank you.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.238
-One question though.
-Yeah?

15:02.440 --> 15:03.873
What are you gonna tell Jake. . .

15:04.040 --> 15:06.474
. . .when he notices
his change jug is gone?

15:06.880 --> 15:10.589
Oh, it'll be okay.
l left him a post-dated check.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.873
lt'll be good
by the time he goes to college.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.430
Yeah, like that kid's going to college.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.278
-Perfect, just perfect.
-Judith, l know what you're thinking--

15:29.440 --> 15:31.829
l'll tell you what,
your brother's a little coward. . .

15:32.000 --> 15:34.514
. . .who don't have guts
to face his responsibilities--

15:34.680 --> 15:36.750
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.751
l suppose you're gonna explain it
to me.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.992
l'm gonna try if you'll calm down
for a minute and listen.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.116
-All right, l'm listening.
-Are you calm?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.998
l'm listening.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.595
Okay. You know why Alan's not here?
Because he's ashamed.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.797
-Well, he should be.
-Judith, that's not listening.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.155
He's ashamed because
no matter how hard he works. . .

15:57.320 --> 15:59.788
. . .he just can't seem to get ahead.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.911
You know,
his business is falling apart.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.559
Really? He hasn't said anything.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.039
Because he's too proud.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.270
Poor guy lost all his chiropractic
walk-ins. . .

16:07.440 --> 16:09.192
. . .to an unlicensed massage parlor. . .

16:09.360 --> 16:11.999
. . .that opened up right between him
and the Jamba Juice.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.832
-You're kidding.
-l'm deadly serious.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.116
Who's gonna pay
to have their spine adjusted. . .

16:16.280 --> 16:20.114
. . .when for half the price
they can get their dingus dusted?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.158
Well, l wouldn't know about that.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.357
As it turns out,
l'm a bit of an expert.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.831
And l'm telling you,
he's going under.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.228
Oh, my God.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.072
-You know he took a part-time job?
-No.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.673
But you didn't hear it from me.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.195
And please,
please don't say anything to Jake.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.634
The last thing Alan wants. . .

16:37.800 --> 16:41.952
. . .is to look like a failure in the eyes
of that little boy in there.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.276
Of course not.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.074
-l won't say a word.
-Thank you.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.111
Hey, where's Dad?

16:50.080 --> 16:51.559
Just go with Uncle Charlie.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.639
Okay.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.673
Why is Mom crying?

16:58.080 --> 16:59.991
Because l'm good.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.154
l'm very, very good.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.356
l'm really getting tired of pizza.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.358
Well, l'm off to work.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.638
Get used to it.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.795
Enjoy your pizza.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.234
Alan, Alan, what are you doing?

17:26.400 --> 17:29.153
l swear to God, l'll get your alimony
as soon as possible.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.357
-No, please, don't worry about it.
-Really?

17:32.520 --> 17:34.078
Charlie told me what's going on.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.516
-l don't need the money right now.
-Really?

17:37.680 --> 17:40.353
l haven't mentioned it.
When my grandmother passed away. . .

17:40.520 --> 17:43.193
. . .she left me
a pretty substantial inheritance.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.873
Really?

17:45.040 --> 17:47.315
ln fact, l want you to have this.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.915
-Really?
-Pay me when you can.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.389
The important thing is
you get back on your feet.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.599
l'm so happy.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.079
Hi, Huggy Bear.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.510
Boy, l love the new car you got me.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.434
Hi, Mrs. Harper,
doesn't he look cute in a mustache?

18:12.160 --> 18:14.355
l'm so sad.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.472
How's that pride doing?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.836
Nice, they let you take a few home.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.037
lt's in lieu of health insurance.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.749
Did you know they actually have
a little machine. . .

18:46.920 --> 18:48.831
. . .that shoots the cheese
into the crust?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.353
-ls that so?
-Yep.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.909
lt's a little high-pressure gun.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.634
You can't kill yourself with it,
though.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.358
l tried.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.439
l gotta tell you something, Alan,
this is from the bottom of my heart.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.310
l think that you are the stupidest man
on the face of the Earth. . .

19:07.480 --> 19:09.789
. . .but l admire your perseverance.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.759
You're gonna have
to talk into the other ear.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.672
This one's full of cheese.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.157
ls that my Huggy Bear?

19:27.320 --> 19:29.436
Yeah, it's him.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.189
Hey, guess what.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.157
You know my roommates Ellie
and Emmett?

19:33.320 --> 19:34.753
Yeah.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.229
Turns out they're not really
brother and sister. . .

19:37.400 --> 19:39.356
. . .so they started sleeping together.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.395
Oh, that's lovely.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.835
Anyway, now they're gonna get
their own place. . .

19:44.000 --> 19:47.390
. . .and l don't know how
l'm gonna pay the rent by myself.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.273
Oh, God, Kandi, l can't. l can't.
l'm all tapped out.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.069
All l have left to put on eBay
is a kidney or a lung.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.357
lf l were you, l'd sell the kidney
because lungs don't grow back.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.669
l'm sorry, honey. . .

20:03.840 --> 20:07.037
. . .you're just gonna have to handle
your living situation on your own.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.953
Okay. Hey, guess what else.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.875
You've got a loved one who needs
either an operation or bail?

20:15.720 --> 20:19.429
No, silly. l'm finished with the dentist
and my mouth is all better.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.079
See?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.038
Hey, l've got an idea.
Why don't you move in with me?

20:25.240 --> 20:26.832
Okay.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.754
l'm so screwed.
