I'm really glad
that you told me how you felt.

00:04.743 --> 00:07.137

I still gave him up.

Lucifer's the reason

00:14.753 --> 00:15.885
that I said yes to Pierce.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.713
He's also the reason
that I said no.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.845
Okay, you could kill me, sure.

you would run away.

00:33.511 --> 00:34.730
this may be
the closest

to Heaven that I'll ever get.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.109

01:06.153 --> 01:07.763
I still can't believe it.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.113
[chuckles softly]

01:10.157 --> 01:12.072
Well, at least you'll get
to see her, Detective.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.771
Eventually. In Heaven.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.949
But I-- well, sadly,
she's gone somewhere

01:19.992 --> 01:22.256

How's poor Daniel?

01:35.269 --> 01:39.099
Hmm, about as good
as you could expect.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.752
He's throwing himself
into work,

01:40.796 --> 01:42.972

01:58.466 --> 02:00.859
Uh, bullets are

02:18.964 --> 02:20.009

02:20.052 --> 02:21.663
I will grieve...

02:21.706 --> 02:23.186
when it's done.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.449
We're gonna find
who did this.

I'm on it, Lieutenant.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.281
Uh, Lucifer, hold
back a second.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.631
Have you spoken
to Amenadiel?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.111
Why?Well, I know

02:35.155 --> 02:38.027
he and Charlotte were close.
He might know something.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.290
I can talk to him myself
if you have an idea where he is.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.292
Well, I think I know
exactly where he is.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.467
You do?

02:43.511 --> 02:45.991
Yes.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.951
I'm-I'm not following.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.780
Well, it appears

02:51.823 --> 02:53.390
that my brother
got his wings back.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.826
How is that possible?

02:54.870 --> 02:58.569
[chuckles softly]
Amenadiel had a crazy theory--

02:58.613 --> 03:00.136
or so I thought--

03:00.180 --> 03:01.659
that everything
that's happened to us,

03:01.703 --> 03:03.487
him losing his wings,
me gaining mine,

03:03.531 --> 03:04.619
even my lost Devil face...

03:04.662 --> 03:06.316
And you believe that?Well, I didn't.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.059
But I'm fairly certain
he's up in Heaven now

03:10.102 --> 03:12.104
and took dear Charlotte
with him,

03:12.148 --> 03:14.803
so perhaps
there's something to it.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.500
You think Amenadiel's
gone forever?Well, who knows

03:16.544 --> 03:17.762
if he'll ever return,

03:17.806 --> 03:19.634
now he's finally home
in the Silver City.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.998
maybe!

that we do.

I will break him.Dan.

a hold of your anger.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.433
I know
it's not easy.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.522
It's the only way
that we can bring him down.

Can you do that?

10:11.698 --> 10:14.396
Yeah.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.615
I can.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.660
I have no choice.Yeah, she's right.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.662
Pierce is more formidable
than either of you realize.

first killer, after all.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.667
And you.
No more of your metaphors.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.626
They're not metaphors.We need to focus
on Pierce.

you and I are gonna talk

10:28.497 --> 10:30.281

been keeping from me.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.283
Very well.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.937
Great.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.070
What's our first move?

10:36.113 --> 10:38.376
Well, Pierce still needs
to cover his tracks,

10:38.420 --> 10:41.466
so if I were him,
I'd be looking for a fall guy.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.251
This was just found
at the crime scene.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.339
I totally missed
the little bugger

10:44.382 --> 10:45.383
in the first couple
of canvasses.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.995
I mean, thank God
Pierce held off

10:48.038 --> 10:50.040
on releasing the scene
until we did a third sweep.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.215
We may have never found it.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.390
Oh, I guarantee
you wouldn't have.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.783
Did you find any DNA on it?

10:53.827 --> 10:55.698
Yeah and we got a match.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.309
A guy named Steve Chamberlain.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.224
That's one of the men that
Charlotte was gonna prosecute.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.357
A hedge fund manager
that was using a charity

11:02.400 --> 11:03.706
to embezzle money.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.316
Sounds exactly like
the kind of dirtbag

11:05.360 --> 11:07.231
who would do something
this terrible.CHLOE: Hey, Ella,

11:07.275 --> 11:10.713
there's something
that I need you to...

11:10.757 --> 11:12.106
[clears throat]There's something
that you should do.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.542
Okay, so if they found this,

11:13.585 --> 11:14.848
at the scene, there's probably
more evidence,

11:14.891 --> 11:16.719
so have the team
do another sweep.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
You got it.We have a lead?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.680
Yeah.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.552
Uh, DNA at the scene points
to one of the criminals

11:23.595 --> 11:25.032
that Charlotte
was gonna prosecute.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.469
That's great.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.862
Well, keep me posted.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.385
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.734
Yeah, will do.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.302
Espinoza.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.999
Uh, yeah, Lieutenant?

11:36.043 --> 11:37.435
Thought I told you to go home.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.395
Yes, sir, you did.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.834
Well, if I were you,
I would still be here, too.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.401
If there's anything
you need...

11:46.444 --> 11:50.144
I need... to catch the bastard
that killed Charlotte.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.276
Good luck.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.324
The improv's paying off.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.848
Admirable work, Daniel.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.154
DAN:
For whatever good it does.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.590
If we don't arrest
Pierce's fall guy,

12:01.633 --> 12:03.418
he's gonna know we're onto him.

12:03.461 --> 12:07.204
But if we do, then we lose
the time that we need

12:07.248 --> 12:09.467
to prove that Pierce is really
the one who did it.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.686
Maybe not.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.747
Think Pierce has gone back
to his Sinnerman network?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.792
LUCIFER:
It makes sense. Pierce
needs to move quickly,

12:29.836 --> 12:31.272
and there are thousands
of people in Los Angeles

12:31.315 --> 12:32.926
that owe him a favor.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.405
Well, maybe one of them is
in Chamberlain's orbit.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.277
If we can figure out
who owes Pierce the favor,

12:36.320 --> 12:37.669
maybe we can get him
to flip on him.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.019
It's a long shot, but...

12:39.062 --> 12:41.412
Yeah, but it's the best
one we got so far, so...

12:41.456 --> 12:43.066
[sighs]
Yeah.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.081
I told you not to park
under that tree.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.822
You need to
clean this crap.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.911
LAPD.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.174
Want to ask you some questions
about Charlotte Richards.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.567
Yeah, sure.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.264
Can we take this inside?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.788
Nosy neighbors and all that.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.836
CHAMBERLAIN: Not sure
why you came all this way.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.230
I'm not answering any questions
without my lawyer.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.667
We're not here about
the embezzling case.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.235
Charlotte Richards
was murdered.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.759
What?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.022
Yeah. And your DNA was found
at the scene of the crime.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.895
I didn't murder her.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.548
We know.You got to listen to me.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.812
I... You do?

13:32.855 --> 13:34.552
You see, we think
you're being framed.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.858
And we'd like your help
in trying

13:35.902 --> 13:37.164
to find out who framed you.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.774
Is this some weird
reverse psychology?

13:38.818 --> 13:39.862
What's your angle?

13:39.906 --> 13:42.517
Never mind.
I'm calling my lawyer.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.388
If you do that,
we can't help you.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.391
Sorry, but this good cop,
bad cop, sad cop thing

13:47.435 --> 13:48.871
isn't working on me.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.873
Besides, a cigarette butt
is pretty flimsy evidence.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.528
He's right. A good frame job
would need more.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.095
Like the murder weapon.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.661
Where would you hide it?CHAMBERLAIN: Nowhere,

13:56.705 --> 13:58.098
because I didn't murder her.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.056
If you did,
where would you hide the gun?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.884
In my desk.What, that one?

14:01.928 --> 14:04.060
I don't-- yes.
That one.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.976
You know, it's not gonna
be there, because I'm not a...

14:09.109 --> 14:12.460
...murderer. W-Whoa.
That is not mine.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.418
For the last time, we know.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.855
CHLOE: Someone planted
this gun here.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.247
We need to know who had access

14:17.291 --> 14:18.814
to this area
in the last 12 hours.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.033
Oh, no.LUCIFER: What?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.035
Had a few friends over today,
have you?

14:22.078 --> 14:24.559
Oh, just a hundred or so.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.213
[indistinct chatter]

14:30.347 --> 14:32.828
I think we made a real
breakthrough today, Simon.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.960
[stammers] Thanks.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.049
A-And I know you're right,
Linda.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.225
Not everyone's
out to get me.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.401
Yeah. Okay. Good.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.098
[door opens]

14:42.142 --> 14:43.708
[gasping]

14:43.752 --> 14:46.668
Are you here
to kill her?
No, no!

14:46.711 --> 14:49.671
That's exactly what someone
trying to kill her would say.

14:49.714 --> 14:50.933
[crying]:
No. No, I...

14:50.977 --> 14:52.065
Maze, he's a patient.

14:54.371 --> 14:57.026
[gasping]

14:57.070 --> 14:58.288
See you next week?

15:00.116 --> 15:01.422
What the hell happened?!

15:01.465 --> 15:03.206
Are you okay?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.121
Yes! I'm fine.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.775
Good.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.478
All right, we need to figure out

15:14.522 --> 15:15.958
who would get a favor
from The Sinnerman.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.003
Well, you did bring along
your own master of favors.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.308
I could suss out
who needed one the most.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.745
Dude, we don't have time
to go person to person.

15:20.789 --> 15:23.705
Pierce is gonna start wondering
where we are soon.

15:23.748 --> 15:24.836
CHLOE:
Yeah, you're right.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.229
We need to narrow down
the list fast.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.448
You know everybody here.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.493
I mean, who would
have a dark secret

15:29.537 --> 15:30.581
that they would
want erased?

15:30.625 --> 15:32.496
Uh, everyone.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.845
What? It's a charity event.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.717
LUCIFER: Ah, charity
is the perfect way

15:35.760 --> 15:36.979
for criminals to launder
their images.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.067
Donate a thousand dollars
to distract

15:38.111 --> 15:39.068
from the million
you just filched.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.983
CHAMBERLAIN:
He's not wrong.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.507
That guy.
Sweatshop abuse.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.771
Him? Insider trading.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.600
Her? Stole the idea for
a company from her own sister.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.211
So it could be anyone.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.995
Everyone here is guilty.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.736
Which means The Sinnerman's
not very good at what he does.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.652
Should've left it to
the professionals, namely moi.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.523
Y-You're right.Well, thank you.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.395
No, I mean he is good
at what he does.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.744
If somebody made a deal
with The Sinnerman,

16:02.787 --> 16:04.311
he's gonna make
their skeletons vanish.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.965
And no one would know
about their crimes at all.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.097
Which means we're not
looking for a criminal.

16:08.141 --> 16:11.448
We're looking for somebody
as clean as can be.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.974
Dan.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.411
Dan.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.283
Who hired you
to frame your boss?

16:20.327 --> 16:21.850
What? What are you
talking about?

16:21.893 --> 16:23.156
Dan.You are innocent.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.679
And that's a bad thing?

16:24.722 --> 16:26.855
You're the only one who has
access to Chamberlain's office

16:26.898 --> 16:28.509
and the only one
with no dirty laundry.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.728
Now, the woman I loved is dead,
so if you don't start talking...

16:30.772 --> 16:31.729
Daniel, Daniel!
Daniel, Daniel.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.775
I understand your anger,

16:33.818 --> 16:34.863
but perhaps a lighter touch

16:34.906 --> 16:36.908
might help reveal
the truth faster.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.910
I mean, after all, this
young man did ask for a favor

16:38.954 --> 16:40.390
from The Sinnerman,

16:40.434 --> 16:43.219
so you must've wanted something
very badly, didn't you?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.134
Yeah. Tell me.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.962
What is it you desired?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.618
I wished I never sneezed.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.968
You interrupted me
for a stupid parlor trick?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
Dan, it's not a trick.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.972
I-I don't know what
it is, but it works.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.496
Calm down.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.802
What happened
when you sneezed?

17:00.845 --> 17:04.066
I...

17:04.110 --> 17:06.590
I took my eyes off the road
for a second.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.680
And... this...

17:09.724 --> 17:11.117
this motorcycle
pulled in front of me

17:11.160 --> 17:12.248
at just the wrong time.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.033
So you killed a biker

17:14.076 --> 17:16.078
and then found somebody
who could make it all disappear.

17:16.122 --> 17:20.039
[stammers] I heard about a guy
who gave out favors,

17:20.082 --> 17:21.301
so I called him.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.042
And the next morning I...

17:23.085 --> 17:24.826
it was like it
never happened.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.175
But it did happen.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.698
No matter how much time
has passed,

17:27.742 --> 17:29.831
every time I look in the mirror,
all I see is...

17:29.874 --> 17:31.180
A monster.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.922
DAN:
And then this morning

17:33.965 --> 17:35.315
he called in his favor.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.100
How'd he contact you?
Would you recognize him?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.536
I never saw anybody.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.104
A burner phone showed up
at my doorstep this morning

17:42.148 --> 17:44.802
and everything after was handled
through dead drops.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.369
All right.
We're gonna need that phone.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.197
Okay.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.418
We're running out of time.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.550
Okay, so then we buy more.
We bring Chamberlain in.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.900
We let him lawyer up
so he doesn't talk.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.728
CHLOE: And then what?
Pierce works with the pros.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.600
There's a good chance there's
no evidence on the burner phone.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.081
Well, perhaps it's time
we asked for some help.

18:10.393 --> 18:13.657
Hey. I got your
text. What's up?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.705
I need something from you.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.447
Of course you do.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.883
I do, too, actually.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.537
That's not what I meant. I...

18:23.580 --> 18:25.365
Hey. Hey.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.541
You have been
through so much.

18:27.584 --> 18:30.413
Okay?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.546
You need to go home.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.243
You need to take
care of you.

18:35.853 --> 18:36.811
We got the guy.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.205
That's just it.
I need you...

18:39.248 --> 18:41.685
[clears throat]
What's up?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.692
I need you
to do me a favor.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.305
Something you can't tell
anyone about.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.184
Lopez, you want to
come in or what?

19:02.228 --> 19:04.882
Uh...

19:04.926 --> 19:06.188
Hey, boss.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.190
What is it?

19:08.234 --> 19:11.541
Dan gave something to me.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.240
Asked me to examine it,

19:14.283 --> 19:16.633
but told me not to tell anyone.

19:16.677 --> 19:17.982
What is it?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.811
A phone?

19:20.855 --> 19:22.378
That's it?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.989
Yeah. I mean, he...
honestly, he sounded

19:25.033 --> 19:26.121
kind of crazy.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.818
He was going on and on

19:27.862 --> 19:30.691
about some frame job
or something.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.084
Huh. Well, what all did he say?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
Uh, not much more than that.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.219
He-he claimed that
"people might be listening."
