What do you see?

14:49.426 --> 14:51.028
That's the sign of the king.

14:51.295 --> 14:53.864
The symbol for the kingdom
of Dal Riata?

14:54.198 --> 14:55.934
The sign of the king.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.300
Exactly.

14:57.602 --> 15:00.170
Now there's a story
behind that sign.

15:00.505 --> 15:02.407
The legend of King Conall,
