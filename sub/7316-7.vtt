00:10.699 --> 00:12.399
It's too dark.

00:12.401 --> 00:14.001
I can't see.

00:14.003 --> 00:16.436
Move over.

00:16.438 --> 00:17.971
Are you crazy?

00:17.973 --> 00:20.874
Old Man Hawkins sees the
light through the garage,

00:20.876 --> 00:23.710
he'll call the cops,
and we'll have records.

00:23.712 --> 00:25.846
How is he gonna see
a light through the wall?

00:25.848 --> 00:27.881
Besides, you know
how many video games

00:27.883 --> 00:30.417
one coin from
a treasure chest can buy?

00:34.023 --> 00:35.088
Whoa.

00:35.090 --> 00:37.991
War stuff.

00:40.129 --> 00:41.194
Don't touch that!

00:41.196 --> 00:42.563
You could get lice!

00:48.871 --> 00:50.904
What is that?

He kills people in here.

01:03.018 --> 01:05.185
No, that's him.

01:05.187 --> 01:08.221
That's Old Man Hawkins.

He followed me for,
like, two blocks.

01:42.625 --> 01:44.224
I couldn't just
shut the door on him.

01:44.226 --> 01:46.126
I didn't think
you liked cats.

01:46.128 --> 01:47.327
I don't.

01:47.329 --> 01:49.162
I gave the landlord
48 hours,

01:49.164 --> 01:50.530
find him another
place to live,

01:50.532 --> 01:52.432
or his furry ass is
out on the street.

01:52.434 --> 01:53.800
Good, that's good.

01:53.802 --> 01:56.336
Got to say something
about that cat, though.

01:56.338 --> 01:58.338
There's something...

01:58.340 --> 02:00.073
He's thoughtful.

02:00.075 --> 02:02.476
Yesterday, he spent an hour
grooming my arm.

02:02.478 --> 02:03.977
Hey, what about your fish?

02:03.979 --> 02:06.079
Ah, that was tricky.

02:06.081 --> 02:07.914
Kate and Ziva are
now in the bathroom,

02:07.916 --> 02:09.716
on the counter, door closed.

02:09.717 --> 02:10.684
Problem solved.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.085
Nice.

02:14.323 --> 02:15.522
Bishop.

02:15.524 --> 02:17.457
What's happening?

02:17.459 --> 02:20.460
My overall field training
evaluation from Gibbs.

02:20.462 --> 02:21.862
Ah...

02:21.864 --> 02:23.497
The probie eval.

02:23.499 --> 02:24.798
Nine months of training,

02:24.800 --> 02:26.967
culminating in one
debilitating document.

02:26.969 --> 02:28.769
Yeah.
What'd you get?

02:28.771 --> 02:31.338
No idea, I'm afraid to open it.

02:31.340 --> 02:34.474
It's just a matter of managing
your expectations.

02:34.476 --> 02:36.643
Might help you to know
that I got a 63.

02:36.645 --> 02:38.111
Out of 100?

02:38.113 --> 02:39.579
Yeah, it's par
for the course.

02:39.581 --> 02:41.882
Kate, who was the girl
before the girl...

02:41.884 --> 02:43.550
What'd she get,
like, a 60?

02:43.552 --> 02:45.619
And then Ziva had a...

02:45.621 --> 02:46.687
She refused to tell us.

02:46.689 --> 02:48.755
Well, what about you, Tony?

02:48.757 --> 02:50.090
Ah, big fat 58.

02:50.092 --> 02:52.192
I wore that score
like a badge of honor.

02:52.194 --> 02:53.593
Okay.

02:53.595 --> 02:55.696
Expectations managed.

02:59.735 --> 03:01.735
Holy crap.

03:01.737 --> 03:02.803
Single digits?

03:02.805 --> 03:04.304
No.

03:04.306 --> 03:05.806
No, I got an 82.

03:06.608 --> 03:07.541
What?

03:07.543 --> 03:10.110
Wow.
Yeah, wow.

03:10.112 --> 03:11.445
I can't believe it.

03:11.447 --> 03:13.447
I mean, an 82,
this is incredible.

03:14.149 --> 03:16.283
What?

03:16.285 --> 03:18.051
Grab your gear, that's what.

03:18.053 --> 03:19.619
Where we headed
to, boss?

03:19.621 --> 03:21.521
Body at Norfolk.

03:21.523 --> 03:24.357
Base PPV housing.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.033
I got the outside taped off.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.335
Neighborhood watch is starting
to assemble.

03:35.337 --> 03:36.703
Anything worth writing down?

03:36.705 --> 03:38.105
Hmm...

03:38.107 --> 03:39.873
They all said the same thing.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.341
Victim kept to himself,

03:41.343 --> 03:43.710
spent a lot of time
out here in his garage.

03:43.712 --> 03:44.845
What do we know?

03:44.847 --> 03:46.313
Well, the victim
is George Hawkins.

03:46.315 --> 03:49.116
65 years old, retired
master sergeant.

03:49.118 --> 03:51.518
27 years
in the Corps.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.320
Clocked out
as an operations chief.

03:53.322 --> 03:55.655
Career Marine.

03:55.657 --> 03:57.057
He's been living here in
Public/Private Venture Housing

03:57.059 --> 03:59.292
ever since DoD opened
it up to retirees.

03:59.294 --> 04:01.461
Got a blood trail.

04:01.463 --> 04:04.731
Yeah, looks like
he could have been dragged.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.767
Two gunshot wounds to the chest.

04:06.769 --> 04:08.769
Where's Ducky?

04:08.771 --> 04:10.170
He's on his way.

04:12.674 --> 04:13.907
He's got something in his hand.

04:13.909 --> 04:15.075
DiNozzo.

04:15.077 --> 04:17.344
Yeah, boss.
Get his hand.

04:27.389 --> 04:28.722
Dog tag?

04:29.892 --> 04:31.057
CJ Kent.

04:33.061 --> 04:34.661
- Could be our killer.
- Not a bad thought.

04:34.663 --> 04:36.396
There's a scuffle
before he's shot,

04:36.398 --> 04:38.865
the master sergeant rips the tag
off his killer, CJ Kent.

04:38.867 --> 04:41.034
I don't think so.

04:41.036 --> 04:42.502
Why not?

04:42.504 --> 04:43.904
Because Sergeant
Charles J. Kent's been dead

04:43.906 --> 04:45.305
for 45 years.

04:45.307 --> 04:47.307
He was killed in action
in the Vietnam War.

04:49.711 --> 04:53.046
So then how did his dog tag end
up in the hand of our victim?

05:04.578 --> 05:06.345
Gibbs should be here
any minute.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.013
Tony's not back yet?

05:08.015 --> 05:09.982
No, he's still processing
Hawkins' garage.

05:09.984 --> 05:11.750
Can't believe
he volunteered to do that.

05:11.752 --> 05:13.686
Yeah, he said he needed
some alone time

05:13.688 --> 05:15.187
to think about cat issues.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.655
Yeah, like that's not weird.

05:16.657 --> 05:19.158
Okay, so we will count Tony out.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.027
You want to give the stats on
Hawkins, and then I'll chime in?

05:22.029 --> 05:24.196
What, are you writing a script
for the update?

05:24.198 --> 05:26.465
I just want to be prepared.

05:26.467 --> 05:28.400
Getting an 82 on my eval,

05:28.402 --> 05:30.302
I feel like I need
to keep earning it.

05:30.304 --> 05:32.905
And I don't even know how I got
it in the first place.

05:32.907 --> 05:34.740
Yeah.

05:35.476 --> 05:37.142
Okay, update. Let's go.

05:37.144 --> 05:39.411
Okay.

05:39.413 --> 05:42.381
Retired Master Sergeant George
Hawkins, murdered yesterday,

05:42.383 --> 05:44.850
discovered holding the dog
tag of Charles J. Kent.

05:44.852 --> 05:48.420
Sergeant Kent was KIA
in Vietnam in 1969.

05:48.422 --> 05:49.755
Connection?

05:49.757 --> 05:50.757
They served together.

05:50.758 --> 05:52.191
Boot camp to Vietnam.

05:52.193 --> 05:54.193
Sergeant Kent had
Hawkins by one rank.

05:54.195 --> 05:55.461
He was actually
Hawkins' squad leader.

05:55.463 --> 05:57.196
On July 17, 1969,

05:57.198 --> 06:00.332
they were on a reconnaissance
mission in Quang Tri Province.

06:00.334 --> 06:03.168
The patrol was ambushed
by the Vietcong.

06:03.170 --> 06:06.338
Sergeant Kent was one of four
Marines killed in the fight.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.840
Following day,
all bodies were recovered,

06:07.842 --> 06:09.341
except for Sergeant Kent's.

06:09.343 --> 06:11.777
JPAC, which stands for

06:11.779 --> 06:13.579
the Joint P.O.W./M.I.A.
Accounting Command,

06:13.581 --> 06:15.481
and you already know that.

06:15.483 --> 06:18.517
Uh, JPAC recently did an
excavation of the ambush site.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.252
Turned up nothing.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.955
To date, Sergeant Kent's
remains are unaccounted for.

06:22.957 --> 06:24.323
JPAC find
his dog tags?

06:24.325 --> 06:26.091
There's no record
of Sergeant Kent's dog tags

06:26.093 --> 06:27.760
being recovered
by anyone.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.795
We don't know where Hawkins got
the one he was holding.

06:29.797 --> 06:31.997
But we did find someone
who might have an idea.

06:31.999 --> 06:34.666
Phone records show a
large number of calls

06:34.668 --> 06:36.402
between Hawkins
and Kent's daughter.

06:36.404 --> 06:38.437
Daughter's name is
Alice Kent Staley.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.105
Bring her in.
Already did.

06:40.107 --> 06:41.136
She's waiting in the
conference room for you.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.042
That's good work.

06:42.043 --> 06:43.642
McGee, give DiNozzo a hand.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.811
Bishop, go check in with Ducky.

06:47.915 --> 06:50.849
You were a Marine.

06:50.851 --> 06:52.384
I can see it
all over you.

06:52.386 --> 06:53.886
Yeah, well...

06:53.888 --> 06:56.955
I joined because of
guys like your dad.

06:56.957 --> 07:00.125
Couple years older than me.

07:00.127 --> 07:03.495
I saw them run straight
into the fire.

07:03.497 --> 07:06.498
Hawk would have liked you.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.134
Master Sergeant Hawkins?

07:09.136 --> 07:10.769
Yes, Hawk.

07:10.771 --> 07:13.072
Anyone who knew him
called him that.

07:13.074 --> 07:16.141
How long have you known him?

07:16.143 --> 07:20.345
Um, when he came home from
the war, I was just a baby.

07:20.347 --> 07:24.283
He felt it was his duty
to watch over me.

07:24.285 --> 07:28.220
Every toothache, holiday,

07:28.222 --> 07:30.456
the birth of my daughter--

07:30.458 --> 07:32.458
Hawk was there.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.128
Do you know where he got
your father's dog tag?

07:37.565 --> 07:40.265
Uh, I-I didn't know he had it.

07:42.303 --> 07:45.003
He never wanted to get my hopes
up about his research, so...

07:45.005 --> 07:47.172
Research?

07:47.174 --> 07:50.976
My father's remains
were never recovered.

07:50.978 --> 07:54.446
He was looking
for Sergeant Kent.

07:54.448 --> 07:56.448
He always talked about
what it would mean

07:56.450 --> 07:58.383
to bring my father home.

07:58.385 --> 08:02.187
As he got older,
it consumed him.

08:02.189 --> 08:05.390
Hawk saw my father get hit.

08:07.194 --> 08:09.795
He held the body.

08:09.797 --> 08:13.799
To not be able to find it
the next day was devastating.

08:13.801 --> 08:15.968
Hawk loved him.

08:19.206 --> 08:22.207
I know by the way he loved me.

08:22.209 --> 08:25.410
We're not gonna stop
until we know who killed him.

08:25.412 --> 08:28.380
How am I gonna tell my daughter?

08:28.382 --> 08:31.750
I mean, Greta's...
she's only eight.

08:31.752 --> 08:35.687
And she adored Hawk.

08:35.688 --> 08:39.291
He was, uh, making
these videos for her.

08:39.293 --> 08:41.860
Stories about her granddad.

08:41.861 --> 08:46.431
He wanted her to know
who he was.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.767
Master Sergeant Hawkins
knew the end was near.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.602
He knew he was
gonna get shot?

08:50.604 --> 08:53.572
No, Eleanor, he knew
he was going to die.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.141
Ductal adenocarcinoma.

08:56.143 --> 08:57.309
Pancreatic cancer.

08:57.311 --> 08:58.911
Patient records show

08:58.913 --> 09:02.748
that Master Sergeant Hawkins was
diagnosed last month.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.118
The cancer was too advanced
for any treatment.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.120
Hmm.

09:07.121 --> 09:09.087
So, had he not been shot...

09:09.089 --> 09:13.125
Well, he would have had
only a few months to live.

09:14.862 --> 09:16.962
Can't imagine knowing
you're gonna die.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.464
We sent the slugs
up to Abby.

09:19.466 --> 09:21.967
She confirmed that
they're .38 Specials.

09:21.969 --> 09:24.536
A bullet commonly used
in revolvers.

09:24.538 --> 09:25.704
Hmm, okay.

09:25.706 --> 09:27.706
Thanks, Ducky, I'll follow up.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.609
Eleanor, can I have a word
with you before you go?

09:30.611 --> 09:33.145
Uh, sure, what's up?

09:33.147 --> 09:35.347
Well, today is
a difficult day.

09:35.349 --> 09:37.015
It is?

09:37.017 --> 09:38.917
You've been training
for nine months now.

09:38.919 --> 09:41.386
Nine months, such a magical
time frame, isn't it?

09:41.388 --> 09:42.988
But think,
in three months,

09:42.990 --> 09:45.490
Breena and I are gonna have
our own little human,

09:45.492 --> 09:48.393
who hopefully enjoys
long walks...

09:48.395 --> 09:51.196
Sorry, this is about you.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.600
Your field training
evaluation.

09:54.602 --> 09:56.668
Oh, right.
Well, actually I...

09:56.670 --> 09:59.371
Allow me to impart
a little bit of wisdom

09:59.373 --> 10:03.408
that I have given to each and
every aspiring agent before you,

10:03.410 --> 10:07.546
on this,
your Probie Eval Day.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.550
Don't fret your number.

10:11.552 --> 10:15.387
Jethro gives low scores,
well, to push you.

10:17.191 --> 10:18.991
Wait, what?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.993
The lower your score,

10:20.995 --> 10:23.428
the more potential
Gibbs thinks you have.

10:25.232 --> 10:27.599
Uh, so if you got a high score?

10:29.069 --> 10:31.603
Well, then I would advise you
to turn in your badge.

10:33.173 --> 10:37.242
<i>I thought I had this working.</i>

10:37.244 --> 10:40.212
Oh, there we go.

10:40.214 --> 10:43.448
Greta, hi, honey.

10:43.450 --> 10:46.551
Your old pal Hawk here.

10:46.553 --> 10:50.789
Uh, I'm gonna be telling you
everything I can

10:50.791 --> 10:54.126
about your granddad.

10:54.128 --> 10:55.961
So you have it.

10:55.963 --> 10:58.530
Uh, as you know,

10:58.532 --> 11:01.066
his name was
Sergeant Charles Kent.

11:01.068 --> 11:04.269
And, um...

11:07.541 --> 11:11.076
He was a hell of a Marine.

11:11.078 --> 11:13.779
Hell of a man.

11:14.615 --> 11:16.381
There's a bunch
of video files on here.

11:16.383 --> 11:19.184
There's a whole bunch of pretty
much everything in this place.

11:25.259 --> 11:28.393
You know,
being in here,

11:28.395 --> 11:30.228
surrounded by one man's
quest to find his friend

11:30.230 --> 11:31.763
and give him a
proper burial,

11:31.765 --> 11:34.166
it's really made
me think about...

11:34.168 --> 11:35.801
the importance of friendship.

11:35.803 --> 11:38.737
Wow, thanks, Tony.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.939
Oh, not you.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.742
This is the cat you found.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.744
Yeah.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.712
Rick Blaine, I named him...

11:46.714 --> 11:49.281
after Humphrey Bogart's
character in <i> Casablanca,</i>

11:49.283 --> 11:51.550
'cause of the fur tuxedo.

11:51.552 --> 11:54.519
You named him?

11:54.521 --> 11:57.022
Yeah, I'm gonna keep him.

11:57.024 --> 11:59.958
“I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.”

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
Well, I don't know.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.027
You sure about
that, Tony?

12:02.029 --> 12:04.196
Look around, Tim.

12:04.198 --> 12:06.598
You can't fight the male bond.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.467
It's epic.

12:08.469 --> 12:09.868
Yeah, epic
and expensive.

12:09.870 --> 12:11.203
Hawkins invested
a lot of money

12:11.205 --> 12:12.738
in his search
for Kent's remains.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.706
Who was he paying?

12:14.708 --> 12:16.508
Well, these are all receipts
from private organizations,

12:16.510 --> 12:19.277
PIs, anyone who said
they could help.

12:19.279 --> 12:21.747
Money, the root of all evil.

12:21.749 --> 12:22.881
Yeah, problem is--

12:22.883 --> 12:24.883
I'm not finding
any kind of motive.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.321
What are you doing?

12:29.323 --> 12:31.990
I think we should get all
this stuff to the master.

12:31.992 --> 12:33.492
If anyone ever breathed
on these papers

12:33.494 --> 12:35.227
while thinking about
killing Hawkins,

12:35.229 --> 12:36.695
Abby will know it.

12:36.697 --> 12:38.463
<i> Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,</i>
<i>Gibbs, Gibbs.</i>

12:38.465 --> 12:40.399
I have news, I have lots
of news, I have big news.

12:40.401 --> 12:42.134
The edge
of my seat, Abbs.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.002
Okay, first of all,

12:44.004 --> 12:46.037
this is not Sergeant
Kent's dog tag.

12:46.039 --> 12:47.072
Whose is it?

12:47.074 --> 12:48.507
It's nobody's.

12:48.509 --> 12:51.009
It was made on an old
graphotype machine,

12:51.011 --> 12:52.744
but the stainless
steel is new.

12:52.746 --> 12:55.213
It was artificially
weathered

12:55.215 --> 12:57.482
using hydrochloric
acid and steel wool,

12:57.484 --> 12:59.017
which left little particles
that rusted.

12:59.019 --> 13:00.452
It's a fake.

13:00.454 --> 13:01.420
Exactly.

13:01.422 --> 13:02.454
There's more--

13:02.456 --> 13:04.089
look at the blood type.

13:04.091 --> 13:05.690
B positive?

13:05.692 --> 13:08.493
Sergeant Kent was B negative.

13:08.495 --> 13:11.296
Now, after all the effort that
Hawkins has put into the search,

13:11.298 --> 13:14.099
there is no way he doesn't know
Sergeant Kent's blood type.

13:14.101 --> 13:15.867
Hawkins knew the tag was fake.

13:15.869 --> 13:16.869
Yep.

13:16.870 --> 13:17.969
The blood trail.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.238
Originally, I thought

13:20.240 --> 13:21.473
that Hawkins had
been dragged

13:21.475 --> 13:22.974
under the table
after he was shot.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.242
But then I saw this.

13:25.412 --> 13:26.711
That's a handprint.

13:26.713 --> 13:28.246
Very good.

13:28.248 --> 13:30.382
Hawkins dragged himself
across the floor

13:30.384 --> 13:32.384
so he could reach
for something on the table.

13:32.386 --> 13:34.286
Now, if we look at
the void in the blood,

13:34.288 --> 13:37.489
we can see the approximate shape
of what he was reaching for.

13:39.993 --> 13:40.959
Dog tag.

13:40.961 --> 13:42.828
A fake dog tag?

13:42.830 --> 13:45.564
I mean, why would
Hawkins' final act

13:45.566 --> 13:47.933
be picking up a dog tag
that he knew wasn't real?

13:47.935 --> 13:50.135
To send us a message.

14:07.879 --> 14:09.378
I know I'm late.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.914
Rick Blaine sat on my alarm
clock, turned it off.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.316
What did I miss?

14:13.318 --> 14:15.451
Looking for the source
of the fake dog tag.

14:15.453 --> 14:16.819
So, whoever gave Hawkins the tag

14:16.821 --> 14:18.487
might have something
to do with his murder.

14:18.489 --> 14:20.589
That makes sense.
All right, I sent both of you

14:20.591 --> 14:21.991
a compiled list
from Hawkins' records.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.293
He contacted five PIs
to help him search

14:24.295 --> 14:27.463
for Kent's remains,
four of whom he paid.

14:27.465 --> 14:30.266
So, the rest are what,
charities?

14:30.268 --> 14:32.134
Yep, and a handful
of for-profits.

14:32.136 --> 14:34.170
Fake tag could've come
from any of them.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.805
Let's split up the list,
start digging.

14:35.807 --> 14:37.206
All right, I'll take the PIs.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.474
McGee.

14:38.476 --> 14:40.443
Okay, you take the PIs.

14:40.445 --> 14:41.944
Magnum and I thank you.

14:41.946 --> 14:43.679
Bishop, you want the charities?

14:45.917 --> 14:47.983
It's the earbuds.

14:48.453 --> 14:51.087
What?

14:51.089 --> 14:52.488
You don't have the earbuds in?

14:52.490 --> 14:53.756
You're ignoring us?

14:53.758 --> 14:55.024
No. No...

14:55.026 --> 14:56.492
I'm not ignoring you,

14:56.494 --> 14:59.995
I'm... silently agonizing.

14:59.997 --> 15:01.897
Why didn't you tell me
a good score wasn't good?

15:01.899 --> 15:02.899
Probie eval.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.266
Oh, right.

15:04.268 --> 15:05.935
Really wasn't our place
to tell you.

15:05.937 --> 15:08.204
Only a fool would knowingly
interfere with Gibbs' methods.

15:08.206 --> 15:10.740
Our job, Ellie B., is
to follow his lead.

15:10.742 --> 15:12.341
Your turn to lead--
what do you got?

15:12.343 --> 15:15.911
Running with the fake
dog tag, boss.

15:15.913 --> 15:17.580
You look like you're
in agony, Bishop.

15:17.582 --> 15:19.882
What? No, all's well.

15:19.884 --> 15:22.918
Good, I want you to look
into Sergeant Kent's remains.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.488
You mean what Hawkins knew?

15:25.490 --> 15:27.757
Hawkins, JPAC, reports.

15:27.759 --> 15:30.092
Anything that can tell us
where to look.

15:30.094 --> 15:33.062
But this is
about Hawkins' murder.

15:33.064 --> 15:35.998
The location of
Sergeant Kent's remains is

15:36.000 --> 15:37.133
irrelevant to the case.

15:37.135 --> 15:40.603
Missing Marine's
always relevant.

15:42.874 --> 15:45.508
Our search for Sergeant Kent's
remains has been harrowing

15:45.510 --> 15:46.909
to say the least.

15:46.911 --> 15:49.445
You conducted a dig
two years ago, Colonel?

15:49.447 --> 15:50.646
Affirmative.

15:50.648 --> 15:52.448
Large grid encompassing the area

15:52.450 --> 15:54.350
where Sergeant Kent's body
was last seen.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.118
And that turned up nothing.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.187
No, actually,
it turned up plenty.

15:58.189 --> 15:59.688
I sent you a series of photos.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.424
You said you wanted
everything we have, correct?

16:01.426 --> 16:02.825
That's right.

16:02.827 --> 16:04.927
Well, let's start...

16:04.929 --> 16:08.164
with Group One, Item A.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.632
Standard-issue canteen.

16:09.634 --> 16:13.836
ID'd as belonging
to Marine Private Raymond Smith.

16:13.838 --> 16:16.172
Item B, unidentified necklace.

16:16.174 --> 16:17.540
No known connection
to the mission.

16:17.542 --> 16:20.476
Item C, plastic water bottle.

16:20.478 --> 16:22.244
No known connection
to the mission.

16:22.246 --> 16:24.079
Excuse me, Colonel.

16:24.081 --> 16:26.849
I-I was hoping to focus on items
linked to Sergeant Kent.

16:26.851 --> 16:29.418
None of the items we recovered
were linked to Kent.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.054
But Hawkins said
he saw Kent's body,

16:32.056 --> 16:33.522
held it even.

16:33.524 --> 16:35.691
The recovery chopper was there
the next day.

16:35.693 --> 16:38.561
How could every trace
of him just disappear?

16:38.563 --> 16:41.897
Vietcong was well aware of
“No Marine left behind.”

16:41.899 --> 16:44.733
We've encountered several cases
of the VC moving bodies

16:44.735 --> 16:45.768
to use as bait.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.670
Could be what happened here.

16:47.672 --> 16:50.773
So, Sergeant Kent's remains
could've ended up anywhere.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.008
That's the frustrating part.

16:53.010 --> 16:56.979
But we don't give up until
they come home, Agent Bishop.

16:59.951 --> 17:00.883
Abby.

17:00.885 --> 17:02.151
Down here, Gibbs.

17:04.555 --> 17:05.721
What are you doing?

17:05.723 --> 17:08.790
I'm reversing a
terrible mistake.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.493
Hawkins made me realize
that saving something

17:11.496 --> 17:13.963
that you might have thrown
away could be useful.

17:16.133 --> 17:17.900
It's my favorite pen.

17:17.902 --> 17:20.269
It ran out of
ink this morning,

17:20.271 --> 17:22.938
but that doesn't mean that
it can't come in handy someday.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.306
What did Hawkins save?

17:24.308 --> 17:26.742
Oh, well, basically everything,

17:26.743 --> 17:30.312
but this is what came in handy.

17:31.382 --> 17:32.314
It was empty?

17:32.316 --> 17:34.550
Not entirely.

17:34.552 --> 17:36.819
There's tiny particles of rust
inside that match our dog tag.

17:36.821 --> 17:37.920
Tag was in the envelope.

17:37.922 --> 17:39.755
And the next question is--

17:39.757 --> 17:42.091
where did the envelope
come from?

17:42.093 --> 17:43.626
It wasn't mailed.

17:43.628 --> 17:44.960
George Hawkins' name is

17:44.962 --> 17:46.395
the only thing written
on the envelope.

17:46.397 --> 17:48.397
The “H” is
very distinctive,

17:48.399 --> 17:49.630
but it's just not
enough to go on.

17:49.654 --> 17:50.634
DNA?

17:50.635 --> 17:52.902
No, this baby
was self-sealed.

17:52.904 --> 17:54.637
Now, the edge of
the envelope was ripped

17:54.639 --> 17:55.905
when Hawkins opened it,

17:55.907 --> 17:58.440
But there was
something left behind.

17:59.577 --> 18:01.443
Logo.

18:01.445 --> 18:02.711
A fourth of a logo.

18:02.713 --> 18:04.380
But never fear,

18:04.382 --> 18:06.482
I searched, and I recovered
the other three quarters.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.018
BST.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.085
It's a travel agency.

18:10.087 --> 18:11.153
Blue Summit Travel.

18:11.155 --> 18:12.454
I already sent
you the address.

18:12.456 --> 18:14.423
To DiNozzo and McGee.
The envelope, too.

18:14.425 --> 18:15.925
Wait, Gibbs, I have an itch,
right here

18:15.927 --> 18:18.360
in the middle of my
back, that I haven't

18:18.362 --> 18:21.163
been able to reach.
I need you...

18:22.466 --> 18:24.700
See?!

18:27.371 --> 18:29.338
Sure it's one of ours?

18:29.340 --> 18:30.573
Can't really make out the logo.

18:30.575 --> 18:31.640
Yeah, we're sure.

18:31.642 --> 18:32.775
“George Hawkins.”

18:32.777 --> 18:33.809
Never heard of him.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.511
Who else uses these envelopes?

18:35.513 --> 18:38.113
Uh, look, I got three employees,
but they're all at lunch.

18:38.115 --> 18:39.582
Somebody's birthday
or something.

18:39.584 --> 18:41.984
And they all have access
to office supplies?

18:41.986 --> 18:43.152
What is this about?

18:43.154 --> 18:44.353
Who's Henry?

18:44.355 --> 18:46.622
What?

18:46.624 --> 18:47.990
Messages here,

18:47.992 --> 18:49.558
all taken by Henry.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.828
Same distinctive “H”
as the one in “Hawkins.”

18:52.830 --> 18:55.297
Guy's name is
Henry Caldwell.

18:55.299 --> 18:56.699
What'd he get himself
into this time?

18:56.701 --> 18:58.634
He get into something before?

18:58.636 --> 19:00.135
Well, I fired
him last week.

19:00.137 --> 19:01.704
Caught him stealing
from petty cash.

19:01.706 --> 19:03.472
Got a home address?

19:03.474 --> 19:06.542
Yeah, uh...
give me a second.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.878
Hey, listen.

19:11.482 --> 19:14.049
I got a question--
you got a cat?

19:14.051 --> 19:16.752
No.

19:16.754 --> 19:18.420
You ever traveled with one?

19:18.422 --> 19:20.189
Well, I don't...

19:20.191 --> 19:21.390
I don't have a cat.

19:21.392 --> 19:22.558
So...

19:22.560 --> 19:23.926
Should think about getting one.

19:23.928 --> 19:25.327
Why?

19:25.329 --> 19:26.562
Hey.
They...

19:26.564 --> 19:27.730
All right, let's go.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.500
Abby already got
the home address?

19:31.502 --> 19:32.901
Yep, she also said

19:32.903 --> 19:34.370
that Caldwell's been arrested
twice for fraud,

19:34.372 --> 19:35.771
has type 1 diabetes,

19:35.773 --> 19:37.106
and plays the banjo.

19:37.108 --> 19:38.774
She got all that,
that fast?

19:38.776 --> 19:40.709
Like you said, she's the master.

19:50.721 --> 19:51.987
Which one is it?

19:51.989 --> 19:54.056
Apartment above the pizza place.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.991
Huh.

19:56.727 --> 19:58.627
That's Caldwell's plate.

19:58.629 --> 19:59.962
Must be home.

20:01.232 --> 20:03.265
Thought Tony and McGee
were meeting us.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.634
Well, they're coming
from the other side of town.

20:05.636 --> 20:08.037
Hey.

20:08.039 --> 20:09.271
What are you doing to my car?

20:09.273 --> 20:10.439
NCIS.

20:10.441 --> 20:11.940
We need to talk.

20:13.077 --> 20:14.443
Cover the back.

20:22.553 --> 20:24.186
Hey, where?

20:41.338 --> 20:42.504
Gibbs?

21:01.726 --> 21:03.625
Freeze!

21:03.627 --> 21:04.927
Gibbs.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.228
I told you to cover the back.

21:06.230 --> 21:07.730
I heard a crash.

21:09.667 --> 21:10.999
Distraction.

21:39.227 --> 21:40.860
Thanks.

21:40.862 --> 21:43.095
No one's had eyes
on Caldwell since we...

21:43.865 --> 21:46.599
Since he got away.

21:46.601 --> 21:47.833
What do we know?

21:47.835 --> 21:49.068
No sign of the
murder weapon

21:49.070 --> 21:50.269
at Caldwell's
apartment

21:50.271 --> 21:51.704
or in his car.

21:51.706 --> 21:53.439
But we did find his laptop,
it's giving me

21:53.441 --> 21:55.241
a pretty good handle on
the scam he was running here.

21:55.243 --> 21:56.308
Let's have it.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.077
He got a hold of a list

21:58.079 --> 21:59.478
from a charity called
Lost Heroes Alliance.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.946
I've heard of them.

22:00.948 --> 22:03.015
They collect info on P.O.W.
and M.I.A. cases.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.618
List consisted of people who
contacted Lost Heroes Alliance

22:05.620 --> 22:07.253
for help with a missing person.

22:07.255 --> 22:09.555
Caldwell turned that
into his target list.

22:09.557 --> 22:12.024
Yep, he made initial contact,

22:12.026 --> 22:14.026
saying he'd found a dog tag
belonging to their loved one.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.661
<i>Fake</i> dog tag.

22:15.663 --> 22:16.762
Then he would ask for the money

22:16.764 --> 22:17.796
to continue his search.

22:17.798 --> 22:18.797
He's got it all
broken down

22:18.799 --> 22:20.032
in a spreadsheet
here.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.268
There was no record
on Hawkins' end.

22:22.270 --> 22:24.637
Well, that's because Caldwell
contacted his targets via phone.

22:24.639 --> 22:26.205
Where is Caldwell?

22:26.207 --> 22:27.506
The BOLO...

22:27.508 --> 22:29.041
I'm not asking
about the BOLO, McGee.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.276
I'm asking where he is.

22:30.278 --> 22:31.577
Uh, I've got something.

22:31.579 --> 22:34.280
So, we know Caldwell had
type 1 diabetes.

22:34.282 --> 22:35.748
He can't go without insulin.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.450
He called in a prescription
two days ago,

22:38.452 --> 22:39.552
hasn't picked it up yet.

22:39.554 --> 22:40.986
He has to go to the pharmacy.

22:40.988 --> 22:42.288
If not, coma city.

22:42.290 --> 22:44.056
You two, go.

22:44.959 --> 22:46.525
Sending you the address.

22:51.465 --> 22:53.165
Gibbs, about Caldwell,

22:53.167 --> 22:54.567
I know I shouldn't have gone in,

22:54.569 --> 22:56.468
and I know it's my fault
he got away...

22:56.470 --> 22:57.836
It's fine.

23:00.308 --> 23:02.841
Where are you with
Sergeant Kent's remains?

23:02.843 --> 23:06.078
I spoke to JPAC in Vietnam,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.680
but I haven't found
anything new.

23:07.682 --> 23:10.049
Keep looking.

23:13.221 --> 23:15.854
There is your granddad.

23:15.856 --> 23:18.757
It's one of the first pictures
I took over there.

23:18.759 --> 23:22.328
Now, this one.

23:22.330 --> 23:25.664
We were sweeping through a vil.

23:25.666 --> 23:30.069
A-And we saw this boy,
couldn't have been more than 15,

23:30.071 --> 23:34.840
eyes as red as tomatoes.

23:34.842 --> 23:37.243
Vietcong had come through
the night before

23:37.245 --> 23:39.378
and killed his parents.

23:39.380 --> 23:42.114
Slit their throats.

23:42.116 --> 23:46.719
Your granddad gave us an order.

23:46.721 --> 23:52.558
Said we would halt and help
this boy bury his parents.

23:54.528 --> 23:58.564
I-I took this of your granddad
and the boy after we were done.

24:00.735 --> 24:02.968
I'll never forget that.

24:07.408 --> 24:09.708
Eleanor, you're still here.

24:09.710 --> 24:13.912
Yeah, uh, thanks again
for letting me work in here.

24:13.914 --> 24:15.247
The quiet helps.

24:20.488 --> 24:24.990
It's amazing how
a single image can...

24:24.992 --> 24:27.459
take you back in time
in an instant.

24:27.461 --> 24:31.030
You were in Vietnam?

24:31.032 --> 24:33.332
I didn't think the Royal Army
Medical Corps was there.

24:33.334 --> 24:36.869
It was an exchange posting
with the U.S. military.

24:38.706 --> 24:42.541
What comes to mind is
the smell of the heat.

24:45.079 --> 24:49.081
When our field hospital
came under fire,

24:49.083 --> 24:50.582
we took the patients
off their bunks

24:50.584 --> 24:54.787
and covered them
with their mattresses.

24:54.789 --> 24:58.023
If only saving them
were that simple.

25:01.329 --> 25:04.563
I think I hear
my pillow calling.

25:05.833 --> 25:09.535
Unless, of course,
you'd like to talk

25:09.537 --> 25:13.305
about the real reason
you're down here.

25:16.243 --> 25:19.678
A suspect got away
because of me.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.948
I completely
screwed up, Ducky.

25:22.950 --> 25:26.652
And I went to Gibbs to explain,
but he said it was fine,

25:26.654 --> 25:29.688
which I know it's not.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.357
The end.

25:31.359 --> 25:34.026
Eleanor,

25:34.028 --> 25:37.629
when the world overwhelms,

25:37.631 --> 25:41.667
I find the best thing to do is
to start by accomplishing

25:41.669 --> 25:44.103
just one little thing.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.507
I don't even think
I can do that anymore.

25:48.509 --> 25:51.276
Well, if you believe that,

25:51.278 --> 25:53.946
why are you sitting
on a frigid floor

25:53.948 --> 25:56.181
in the middle of the night?

26:18.806 --> 26:21.540
Just did two walks
around the block.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.642
No sign of Caldwell.

26:23.644 --> 26:26.445
What, you couldn't have
got me the apple one?

26:26.447 --> 26:29.348
Eat your breakfast, McGee.

26:29.350 --> 26:31.483
What's wrong with you?

26:31.485 --> 26:35.220
I just pulled an all-nighter
in a 24-hour pharmacy.

26:35.222 --> 26:36.822
What more do you want from me?

26:36.824 --> 26:38.924
Well, you were fine
two minutes ago.

26:38.926 --> 26:39.926
Drop it.

26:39.927 --> 26:40.893
Tony, what...

26:40.895 --> 26:43.195
Rick Blaine's gone, okay?

26:43.197 --> 26:45.397
What?

26:45.399 --> 26:47.032
Just got a call from
the cleaning lady.

26:47.034 --> 26:48.467
She was taking out
the trash, and he,

26:48.469 --> 26:52.204
he just went...
right out the door.

26:52.206 --> 26:53.872
He escaped.

26:53.874 --> 26:55.707
He ran down all those stairs?

26:55.709 --> 26:58.777
No, he took the elevator.

26:58.779 --> 26:59.912
Huh.

26:59.914 --> 27:00.914
Why, I ask myself,

27:00.915 --> 27:03.282
why would he
want to go?

27:03.284 --> 27:05.717
We were connected, he...

27:05.719 --> 27:08.887
He was like the feline version
of me, you know?

27:08.889 --> 27:12.458
Maybe he just needed to be free.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.426
Yeah.

27:14.428 --> 27:16.295
Yeah, I get that.

27:16.297 --> 27:18.997
Maybe he was in heat?

27:18.999 --> 27:21.233
Can male cats
be in heat?

27:25.940 --> 27:27.906
Caldwell, freeze.

27:27.908 --> 27:30.309
NCIS, hands
in the air.

27:30.311 --> 27:31.844
I need my meds.

27:39.253 --> 27:41.954
Caldwell.

27:41.956 --> 27:43.489
Insulin kicking in?

27:43.491 --> 27:45.290
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

27:45.292 --> 27:47.793
Hey, listen, l-let me
save you some time.

27:47.795 --> 27:49.828
I ran from you, and I'm sorry.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.830
Yesterday was
a horrible day for me,

27:51.832 --> 27:53.365
I'm sure it was
a bad day for you.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.800
And I was
a huge part of that.

27:54.802 --> 27:56.835
Apologies to you, sincerely.

27:56.837 --> 27:59.805
You sorry about Hawkins, too?

27:59.807 --> 28:02.307
The Vietnam guy, the vet?

28:02.309 --> 28:05.477
Yeah. I really am.

28:05.479 --> 28:08.413
Tell me about it.

28:08.415 --> 28:11.316
Well, if you know the vet,
you know the con, right?

28:11.318 --> 28:12.784
I brought him a dog tag.

28:12.786 --> 28:14.720
He said
it was the wrong blood type,

28:14.722 --> 28:17.189
and he said
he was gonna go to the cops.

28:17.191 --> 28:20.192
So, you-you killed
him before he could.

28:20.194 --> 28:22.494
What?

28:22.496 --> 28:24.696
Ah, come on.

28:24.698 --> 28:28.166
Come on, don't go getting
all shy on me now.

28:28.168 --> 28:29.902
No, no, seriously.

28:29.904 --> 28:32.004
The vet is dead?

28:34.174 --> 28:37.376
Aw, man. Aw, man.

28:37.378 --> 28:39.845
Listen, sir,
I've been straight with you

28:39.847 --> 28:41.847
since you walked
through that door.

28:41.849 --> 28:44.116
Straight as a con.

28:44.118 --> 28:47.185
I don't run this thing
by myself, okay?

28:47.187 --> 28:49.187
I'm a people person, okay?

28:49.189 --> 28:50.822
I work with clients.

28:50.824 --> 28:53.625
My partner-- he gets the tags,

28:53.627 --> 28:56.495
works behind the scenes.

28:56.497 --> 28:57.930
Oh. So, let me guess.

28:57.932 --> 28:59.765
Your partner killed Hawkins.

28:59.767 --> 29:02.100
I don't know.
I don't know what he did.

29:02.102 --> 29:04.836
I told him the vet was
gonna talk, and I'm done.

29:04.838 --> 29:09.408
I was trying to get some money
together to leave town, and

29:09.410 --> 29:10.842
T didn't want to run.

29:10.844 --> 29:12.411
Said he was gonna go over there,

29:12.413 --> 29:13.979
scare the guy
into keeping him quiet.

29:13.981 --> 29:16.481
Partner called “T.”

29:16.483 --> 29:18.917
It's really convenient.

29:18.919 --> 29:21.587
Could be anyone.

29:21.589 --> 29:24.456
He calls himself “T”
to protect himself.

29:24.458 --> 29:28.293
I don't know anything else
about him.

29:28.295 --> 29:30.329
Why would I chase down a letter?

29:30.331 --> 29:33.432
Everything I got points to you.

29:36.503 --> 29:38.570
All right,
his name's Todd Price.

29:38.572 --> 29:40.472
I worked out of his shop.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.408
Place called Blue Summit Travel.

29:46.113 --> 29:48.413
<i>Hey, Price wasn't at</i>

29:48.415 --> 29:49.681
the travel agency.

29:49.683 --> 29:51.249
Wasn't at
home, either.

29:51.251 --> 29:53.285
Roommate told us
that Price owns a revolver.

29:53.287 --> 29:54.820
Smith & Wesson
.38 Special.

29:54.822 --> 29:56.922
We trust the roommate?
Don't have to.

29:56.924 --> 29:59.758
We searched the place, found
the revolver in a crawl space.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.059
Abby's running ballistics.

30:01.061 --> 30:03.729
Come on, McGee.
Where is he?

30:03.731 --> 30:06.665
Phone's still off.

30:06.667 --> 30:07.599
Ah, damn.

30:07.601 --> 30:08.467
What?

30:08.469 --> 30:09.534
Flight manifest.

30:09.536 --> 30:11.803
Right after we paid him a visit,

30:11.805 --> 30:13.105
he hopped a flight to Da Nang.

30:13.107 --> 30:15.040
Bought his ticket
at the airport in cash.

30:15.042 --> 30:16.274
Landed two hours ago.

30:16.276 --> 30:17.876
Gear up for Vietnam?
Nah.

30:17.878 --> 30:19.711
Give me something solid first.

30:19.713 --> 30:23.081
Well, I've got bank records.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.583
Ah. So, whenever
Caldwell deposits

30:24.585 --> 30:26.985
a check from a target,
there's a corresponding

30:26.987 --> 30:28.754
transaction in Price's account.

30:28.756 --> 30:30.055
Caldwell was giving him half.

30:30.057 --> 30:31.456
He was being straight with you.

30:31.458 --> 30:32.991
Price was his partner.
Proves motive.

30:32.993 --> 30:35.894
Abby says we got ourselves
a murder weapon.

30:35.896 --> 30:37.562
Price's fingerprints
are all over it.

30:37.564 --> 30:40.465
DiNozzo.
'Nam go-bag, check.

30:40.467 --> 30:42.100
McGee, get us a flight.

30:42.102 --> 30:45.437
Gibbs, I have a lead on
Sergeant Kent's remains.

30:45.439 --> 30:46.938
Good. Give it to JPAC.

30:46.940 --> 30:49.374
This is Kent.
Look at the necklace

30:49.376 --> 30:52.044
on the boy next to him.
The medallion has

30:52.046 --> 30:54.546
three flowers
on it. This...

30:54.548 --> 30:55.881
is the same necklace.

30:55.883 --> 30:57.516
JPAC found it
in the ambush site.

30:57.518 --> 31:00.519
I think the boy might have moved
Kent's body.

31:00.521 --> 31:01.987
We have to find him.

31:01.989 --> 31:03.755
If you're going to
Vietnam, I'm coming.

31:03.757 --> 31:07.359
Bishop, get your lead to JPAC,
let them do their job. McGee?

31:07.361 --> 31:09.428
Uh, Dulles.
Flight leaves in 45.

31:09.430 --> 31:12.264
An My village-- that's
where the photo was taken.

31:12.266 --> 31:14.766
I spent all night
researching it.

31:14.768 --> 31:18.370
Just give me the chance,
let me prove myself.

31:19.373 --> 31:21.406
That why you went in
after Caldwell?

31:22.701 --> 31:24.601
Prove yourself?

31:24.604 --> 31:28.172
What else am I supposed to do
when you don't believe in me?

31:30.076 --> 31:33.011
Yeah, I know what an
82 on the eval means.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.515
Oh. Yeah, I got to get a thing
for my thing.

31:37.517 --> 31:40.184
I'm gonna help him
with that thing.

31:41.788 --> 31:43.721
I'm doing things
different now.

31:43.723 --> 31:45.757
High score means
you did good, that's it.

31:45.758 --> 31:47.290
You pushed all
the other probies.

31:47.292 --> 31:48.309
Enough.
Why would you change things for me?

31:48.309 --> 31:49.466
Why?
Bishop.

31:49.467 --> 31:51.033
Why are you treating me
different?

31:51.036 --> 31:53.203
You know what
I want to say to you

31:53.205 --> 31:54.504
for letting Caldwell
get away?

31:54.506 --> 31:56.473
Something other
than “It's fine”"

31:56.475 --> 31:59.676
You're damn right!
Then say it!

32:01.447 --> 32:04.481
You're going easy on me.

32:04.483 --> 32:08.685
For Caldwell, for the eval.

32:08.687 --> 32:12.656
You've been going easy on me
since day one, haven't you?

32:45.206 --> 32:47.273
Agent Gibbs.

32:47.275 --> 32:48.541
Agent DiNozzo.

32:48.543 --> 32:51.244
Welcome to Da Nang.

32:51.246 --> 32:52.478
Thanks for meeting us, Colonel.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.914
Was just a quick chopper
over from An My.

32:54.916 --> 32:56.582
We haven't turned up
anything yet,

32:56.584 --> 32:57.984
but my team is hopeful

32:57.986 --> 32:59.552
about Agent
Bishop's lead.

32:59.554 --> 33:01.120
Here's a few of Hawkins'
original photos.

33:01.122 --> 33:03.356
Bishop thought they might be
clearer than the scans.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.759
I was looking forward
to thanking her for her work.

33:06.761 --> 33:08.995
Yeah, yeah, she
couldn't make the trip.

33:08.997 --> 33:11.297
Well, pass along
my gratitude?

33:11.299 --> 33:12.832
Yep.
Over here.

33:12.834 --> 33:14.534
So, the man
you're looking for,

33:14.536 --> 33:16.969
you said he's pushing
fake dog tags?

33:16.971 --> 33:19.405
Yeah. Todd Price.

33:19.407 --> 33:20.506
You know him?
No.

33:20.508 --> 33:22.008
Just this market?

33:22.010 --> 33:23.376
They're everywhere.

33:23.378 --> 33:25.545
Tourists feel compelled
to buy them, return them

33:25.547 --> 33:28.147
to the next of kin.
Most times, the tags

33:28.149 --> 33:30.349
belong to a vet
who survived the war,

33:30.351 --> 33:32.251
just got lost somewhere
along the way.

33:32.253 --> 33:33.653
Or they're fake.

33:34.456 --> 33:35.621
Yes.

33:35.623 --> 33:36.956
<i>Cam on.</i>

33:36.958 --> 33:39.425
When Saigon fell
at the end of the war,

33:39.427 --> 33:40.693
the U.S. pulled out fast.

33:40.695 --> 33:41.994
Left a lot behind,

33:41.996 --> 33:43.963
including graphotype machines.

33:43.965 --> 33:47.133
People get their hands on them,
use them to make fakes.

33:47.135 --> 33:48.868
Price has specific targets.

33:48.870 --> 33:51.504
He's got to be making
his own tags.

33:51.506 --> 33:52.905
Can we trace
the machines?

33:52.907 --> 33:55.141
Ah, they've had almost
40 years to change hands.

33:55.143 --> 33:56.976
Could be anywhere by now.

33:56.978 --> 33:58.578
This way.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.113
Jump! Jump! Jump!

34:00.115 --> 34:02.115
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

34:02.117 --> 34:04.750
Okay, okay, that's it, I'm done.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.720
No, McGee, we have to get
your adrenaline up. I need you.

34:07.722 --> 34:10.123
Abbs, I have pulled
two all-nighters in a row.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.991
I have nothing left to give.

34:11.993 --> 34:14.527
I have two things left to give,
and they're both Caf-POWs!

34:14.529 --> 34:16.795
POW! POW!
Jimmy, you are a lifesaver.

34:16.797 --> 34:17.897
You, drink.

34:17.899 --> 34:20.166
Can I get you guys
anything else?

34:21.002 --> 34:23.436
Yes. A fresh set of ears.

34:23.438 --> 34:26.806
Okay, I can... see what
I can find down in Autopsy.

34:26.808 --> 34:28.206
No, Jimmy, Jimmy. Jimmy.

34:28.208 --> 34:30.309
I meant <i> living...</i> ears.

34:30.311 --> 34:32.245
Like, listen to
what we have

34:32.246 --> 34:34.147
and... give us the take

34:34.149 --> 34:36.516
of a non-exhausted,
logical person.

34:36.518 --> 34:38.885
That's way easier.

34:38.887 --> 34:40.219
That I can do.

34:40.221 --> 34:41.786
Okay...

34:41.789 --> 34:43.822
so, travel
records show

34:43.824 --> 34:45.591
that Price went
to Vietnam often,

34:45.592 --> 34:48.728
but there's no trace
of where he stays.

34:48.730 --> 34:51.030
I questioned Caldwell again--
he said that Price bought

34:51.032 --> 34:52.732
a graphotype machine
in Da Nang.

34:52.734 --> 34:54.900
He goes there
to make the tags.

34:54.902 --> 34:56.735
Whew!

34:56.737 --> 34:58.346
Wow.
Wow what?

34:58.347 --> 34:59.625
I think that Caf-POW!
is starting to hit me.

34:59.649 --> 35:02.064
I'm getting a lot
of swirling ideas in my head.

35:02.065 --> 35:03.431
Okay, harness it,
harness it-- use it,

35:03.433 --> 35:04.766
use it, McGee,
don't fight this.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.668
Question: why wouldn't Price

35:06.670 --> 35:08.736
just ship the machine back here?

35:08.738 --> 35:10.772
Good, Jimmy.
It's far more convenient

35:10.774 --> 35:12.807
to swindle people from home.

35:12.809 --> 35:16.711
Unless he had to go back
to Vietnam anyways.

35:16.713 --> 35:19.547
He had other business
in Da Nang.

35:20.951 --> 35:22.584
This is so great. This...

35:22.971 --> 35:25.071
What are we looking for?
If Price

35:25.073 --> 35:26.672
has a business
we don't know about,

35:26.674 --> 35:28.140
he's got to be
hiding it.

35:30.812 --> 35:33.093
Hidden account
through Blue Summit Travel.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.494
Travel.

35:37.118 --> 35:39.151
- Are you seeing this?
- Yep.

35:39.153 --> 35:42.088
Hundreds of e-mails between
Price and a woman named...

35:42.090 --> 35:44.056
Phan Thi Kim.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.992
They're <i> love</i> letters.

35:45.994 --> 35:49.128
His other business in Da Nang
is his <i> girlfriend.</i>

35:49.130 --> 35:50.363
Yep.

35:50.365 --> 35:53.232
Tracking the IP address
to find a location.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.667
Da Nang!

35:54.669 --> 35:56.836
Got it!

36:05.780 --> 36:07.013
NCIS! Hands on your head,

36:07.015 --> 36:09.181
Price.
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

36:09.183 --> 36:10.850
Your girlfriend here?

36:10.852 --> 36:12.552
No, no, she went out.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.288
Get on your feet.

36:15.290 --> 36:18.057
Look, I don't know what
it is you think I did...

36:19.561 --> 36:21.027
Place is clear.

36:21.029 --> 36:22.528
Oh, look at that.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.196
A dog tag-making machine.

36:24.198 --> 36:26.666
Did you tell him we have
the murder weapon, too?

36:28.436 --> 36:29.635
It was self-defense.

36:29.637 --> 36:31.304
I went there, just to scare him.

36:31.306 --> 36:32.939
He came at me--
I'm telling you,

36:32.941 --> 36:34.440
it was self-defense.
You used people's hope.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.641
Wait, no, no,
listen, listen, I...

36:35.643 --> 36:37.543
You murdered a United
States Marine.

36:37.545 --> 36:39.779
There is no
defense for that.

36:40.882 --> 36:44.050
Get him dressed
and back to DC.

36:44.052 --> 36:46.319
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

36:47.555 --> 36:49.755
Where, Leland?

36:51.960 --> 36:55.494
His name is Ky Van Tu.

36:55.496 --> 36:57.530
He left his necklace
at the ambush site,

36:57.532 --> 36:59.665
because the lotus flower
is a sacred symbol.

36:59.667 --> 37:02.668
He wanted to bless the place
where Kent died.

37:02.670 --> 37:04.837
Why did he move
the body?

37:04.839 --> 37:07.306
He'll tell you himself.
He asked to speak

37:07.308 --> 37:09.875
to someone who would see
the family in person.

37:18.853 --> 37:21.053
I will try in English.

37:21.055 --> 37:22.588
<i>Chao.</i>

37:22.590 --> 37:24.624
<i>Chao.</i>

37:26.794 --> 37:28.861
This is, uh, me.

37:28.863 --> 37:30.763
This man...

37:30.765 --> 37:34.300
he help me bury
my mother...

37:34.302 --> 37:36.335
my father.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.070
I want to thank him,

37:38.072 --> 37:41.040
but I do not know how.

37:41.042 --> 37:42.842
So I follow.

37:42.844 --> 37:46.646
I follow far behind.

37:46.648 --> 37:48.814
Soon I hear gun,

37:48.816 --> 37:50.850
and I hide.

37:51.719 --> 37:53.686
After...

37:53.688 --> 37:56.889
I see my friend dead.

37:56.891 --> 37:59.458
You saw his body?

37:59.460 --> 38:01.293
Yes.

38:01.295 --> 38:03.529
I, uh...

38:03.531 --> 38:06.298
I run home for my cart,

38:06.300 --> 38:09.001
and I bring my friend here.

38:10.238 --> 38:12.204
Why?

38:14.542 --> 38:16.442
I bury him...

38:16.444 --> 38:19.412
next to my parents.

38:21.015 --> 38:24.884
I do not know that...
his family look for him.

38:32.660 --> 38:35.261
This is how I honor him.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.365
This is how I thank him.

38:43.104 --> 38:46.939
<i>When I got home, people</i>
<i>were angry about the war.</i>

38:47.809 --> 38:51.243
Little girl, about your age...

38:51.245 --> 38:54.914
she saw my uniform,
threw a rock at me.

38:58.653 --> 39:00.586
Big, tough Marine,

39:00.588 --> 39:05.391
and there I was, getting my
heart broken by a little girl.

39:07.328 --> 39:09.295
<i>I was...</i>

39:09.297 --> 39:11.464
<i>ashamed to wear the uniform</i>

39:11.466 --> 39:14.300
<i>that I had been</i>
<i>so proud of before.</i>

39:15.636 --> 39:17.636
<i>But then...</i>

39:17.638 --> 39:19.805
<i>I thought about Kent.</i>

39:19.807 --> 39:23.876
<i>Your granddad,</i>
<i>he would have told me</i>

39:23.878 --> 39:26.045
<i>to wear my blues proud...</i>

39:26.047 --> 39:29.615
<i>and to keep fighting</i>
<i>for what was right...</i>

39:30.685 --> 39:34.587
<i>...no matter what people say.</i>

39:34.589 --> 39:36.489
<i>That's...</i>

39:36.491 --> 39:39.525
<i>what I tried to do, Greta--</i>

39:39.527 --> 39:41.093
<i>keep fighting...</i>

39:41.095 --> 39:43.763
<i>for what matters.</i>

39:43.765 --> 39:47.500
<i>Bringing your granddad home,</i>
<i>it matters.</i>

39:55.443 --> 39:57.743
Thank you.

39:59.714 --> 40:03.582
He was the best friend
I ever had.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.020
He mattered.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.524
We all matter.

40:37.451 --> 40:39.685
DiNozzo? McGee?

40:39.687 --> 40:42.087
Just left a few minutes ago.

40:42.089 --> 40:44.356
You?

40:44.358 --> 40:48.194
Just finishing up my stuff
for a JPAC's report.

40:49.363 --> 40:52.531
Sergeant Kent's
family is grateful.

40:56.103 --> 40:58.470
You did good work.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.308
Thanks.

41:07.982 --> 41:09.582
Bishop.

41:10.785 --> 41:13.085
You were right.

41:14.455 --> 41:16.222
I was?

41:16.224 --> 41:20.092
I <i> have</i> been going easy on you.

41:20.094 --> 41:23.662
But it's got nothing
to do with you.

41:23.664 --> 41:26.932
Well, I don't understand.

41:31.706 --> 41:34.773
It's about that desk.

41:41.716 --> 41:44.550
Lost two people off that desk.

41:47.121 --> 41:49.955
Good people.

41:53.527 --> 41:56.228
That's on me.

41:56.230 --> 41:59.365
I was doing something wrong.

41:59.367 --> 42:02.601
When something's wrong...

42:02.603 --> 42:04.870
you change it.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.907
This job is hard.

42:07.909 --> 42:10.075
I know that.

42:10.077 --> 42:12.878
No, it's hard, Gibbs.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.348
It's inevitable you'd
lose people along the way.

42:16.350 --> 42:20.286
It doesn't mean
your way of teaching is wrong.

42:21.522 --> 42:24.990
Look at Tony and McGee--
they're amazing.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.061
Yeah.

42:29.063 --> 42:31.530
I want to be like them.

42:31.532 --> 42:34.900
I want to be like you, Gibbs.

42:36.737 --> 42:40.906
I'm asking you to push me
to be like you.

42:44.912 --> 42:47.446
Okay.

42:48.282 --> 42:50.282
Okay?

42:50.284 --> 42:52.918
Yeah. Okay.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.421
Back to the old way.

42:55.423 --> 42:57.589
Thank you.

42:57.591 --> 42:59.291
This floor...

42:59.293 --> 43:02.027
is for standing and walking.

43:02.897 --> 43:04.496
What?

43:04.498 --> 43:07.433
Sit in your damn chair, Bishop.
