01:31.825 --> 01:34.393
mayor Koch vowed to put
more police on the street

01:34.395 --> 01:36.261
as the city's murder rate soars.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.263
- Last year the city
set a new record. -

01:38.265 --> 01:39.765
a felony every four minutes.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.744
Boy.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.314
Don't come sneaking in here
in the middle of the night.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.716
- Hey, what's going on?
- Just go back to sleep.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.850
Who's that?

01:58.852 --> 02:01.286
None of your business.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.289
Oh, and the TV is in the shop.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.724
Go and pick it up
this afternoon.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.902
I got to go to class.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.449
I got to go.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.428
Don't let my mother
see you leave.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.544
Let's work together,
let's work together. All right.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.414
I'm telling you,
it was a real thing.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.915
I call it bullshit, dread.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.751
It was called
the black star line.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.386
What I going to Africa for?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.421
Me come from the west indies
just like you.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.657
No, man.
That's where we ended up.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.026
But we all came over
on slave ships.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.595
Imagine if all the policemen,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.030
all the politicians

03:18.032 --> 03:20.065
and all the businessmen
were your people.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.533
What are you talking about?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.536
Marcus Garvey.
I can't get the man to go to Harlem,

03:24.538 --> 03:26.438
and he want to go back
to Africa.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.674
Hey! None of you

03:28.676 --> 03:31.677
are gonna be graduating
if you keep fucking up!

03:32.680 --> 03:34.346
Hey.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.348
Your man still paying for cars?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.523
Yeah. Same as always.

03:37.548 --> 03:41.010
Just bring anything off the
street to the back. -All right.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.731
Yo!

03:52.733 --> 03:54.900
That's my car!
Where you going!

03:58.938 --> 04:00.939
I'm gonna kill this fool.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.094
Yo! I'm gonna break your face!

04:49.155 --> 04:52.891
Hey, Antoinette.
Let me help you.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.693
Hey, Colin. Thank you.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.862
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen you in a while.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.597
How's your mom doing?

04:58.599 --> 05:01.066
She's good. I had to get
this TV fixed for her.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.869
Oh. Well, say hi for me.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.074
Um, right there is fine.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.584
Can I help you with something?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.119
Will you go out with me
sometime?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.755
Antoinette, is that you?

05:31.697 --> 05:32.998
Colin.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.167
Thanks.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.837
Tomorrow?

05:40.773 --> 05:43.442
I'll think about it.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.932
- Colin Warner?
- Nothing funny!

06:06.934 --> 06:09.568
- Watch him. There we go.
- Whoa, what are you doing?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.970
- Get him to the car!
- Come on! -Hey!

06:11.972 --> 06:13.538
- Get off me, man.
- Cuff this guy.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.006
What are you doing?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.675
They always think
they're gonna get away.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.143
Okay. There we go.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.845
Nice and easy.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.146
There.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.016
All the way in.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.837
Look, the best thing
you could possibly do

06:45.839 --> 06:47.138
for yourself right now

06:47.140 --> 06:48.974
is tell me what happened.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.843
This is not gonna go away.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.278
It was in the middle
of the fucking afternoon,

06:53.280 --> 06:54.546
for Christ's sake.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.047
So go ahead.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.949
Why did you shoot Marvin?

06:57.951 --> 07:00.151
- Excuse me?
- Did he owe you money?

07:00.153 --> 07:01.820
Is that why you shot him?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.222
I didn't shoot anybody.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.592
We have an eyewitness who
picked you out of a photo I.D.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.994
I'm sorry, sir,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.195
you guys have made a mistake.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.930
Do you know
what's gonna happen to you

07:11.932 --> 07:13.172
if you don't start cooperating?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.535
This is a statement

07:16.537 --> 07:18.036
acknowledging your involvement

07:18.038 --> 07:19.638
in the shooting of Marvin Grant.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.106
Everything in here
has been corroborated

07:21.108 --> 07:22.541
by an eyewitness.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.709
You understand what that means?

07:33.019 --> 07:35.120
I'm not signing that.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.988
I ain't no killer.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.795
All right, let's go!

08:32.812 --> 08:34.712
- You real cute!
- Put your hands...

08:34.715 --> 08:35.746
St-stand back!

08:41.386 --> 08:42.953
Let's go. Come on.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.799
Kc, phone for you.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.401
I'll call them back, please.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.269
It's something about Colin.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.305
They said it's urgent.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.309
- What's the prisoner's name?
- Colin Warner.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.410
All right.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.948
Uh, nope.
He's been denied bail.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.851
For how long?

09:12.853 --> 09:16.087
Till he goes to trial, unless
the judge rules otherwise.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.791
- All right, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.794
I'm sorry, dread.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.763
So, where's my mother?

09:26.198 --> 09:29.434
She had to go to work.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.770
Something with her boss.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.243
You all right, man?

09:39.845 --> 09:42.714
It's fucked up in here.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.917
And no matter what I say,
nobody want to listen to me.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.287
Not even my own mother.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.857
Brethren, the truth
is going to come out.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.827
All right?

09:55.829 --> 09:59.197
Just hang in there
until the trial start.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.104
Them whitey have
killed enough people out there.

10:06.106 --> 10:06.963
Yo, pass that shit!

10:06.988 --> 10:09.307
Y-you're worried about those
shooters in flatbush?

10:09.309 --> 10:10.975
I heard they grabbed some dread

10:10.977 --> 10:12.477
that had nothing to do with it.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.145
Yeah, man,
them cats are harassing them.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.147
Yo! It's me
you're talking about!

10:16.149 --> 10:19.184
Hey! Shut the fuck up in there!

10:31.931 --> 10:33.331
Hey, uh...

10:33.333 --> 10:35.166
Did you hear that guy

10:35.168 --> 10:37.769
that was talking about
those shootings in flatbush?

10:37.771 --> 10:40.238
- Nah.
- What about you?

10:44.510 --> 10:47.479
I heard your wife, she
came in to see you yesterday.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.084
Hey, uh...

10:53.086 --> 10:56.287
Do you know a guy
named Marvin Grant?

10:57.957 --> 11:00.492
He used to live in my building.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.794
The police are saying
I killed him.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.963
They're saying I shot him.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.233
He shot a guy named Spangler

11:08.235 --> 11:10.468
couple days
before he was murdered.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.072
<i>So Spangler cousin
was out for revenge.</i>

11:14.074 --> 11:16.040
<i>Seven, eight, nine.</i>

11:16.042 --> 11:17.308
<i>Two up to three, four,</i>

11:17.310 --> 11:19.844
- five, six, seven, eight...

11:40.432 --> 11:41.566
Hello.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.234
This is a collect call

11:43.236 --> 11:44.803
from the department
of corrections.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.205
- Do you accept the charges?
- Yeah, I accept.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.507
- Hello?
- Colin: Kc, listen, there's a guy

11:49.509 --> 11:51.176
named Anthony Gibson
killed Marvin.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.211
There's a guy in here
who knows what happened.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.580
I need you to go down
to the 67th precinct.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.482
Tell them this guy
is willing to talk.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.284
- I got to go.
- -All right. -

11:59.286 --> 12:01.152
- who was that?
- It was Colin.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.922
He found out about the shooting.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.958
I got to go to the precinct.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.263
Excuse me.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.065
I-I need to speak
to a detective

12:14.067 --> 12:16.134
about the Marvin Grant homicide.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.069
You got to come back tomorrow.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.171
- No one's here right now.
- No, I have information

12:20.173 --> 12:21.906
about a homicide.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.942
It can't wait till tomorrow.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.544
I'm telling you
no one's here now.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.114
A first place tie.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.183
That's your badge number there?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.352
You want to make the call,

12:34.354 --> 12:36.354
or you want me
to file a complaint?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.023
I have all night
to fill out paperwork.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.359
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Damn straight.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.470
- How you doing?
- What's up, Jimmy?

13:00.313 --> 13:03.414
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:07.018
You're saying this guy Anthony
was the shooter and not Colin?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.586
That's right.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.189
- So, Colin was the driver?
- No.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.658
Colin had nothing to do with it.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.593
Who told you this?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.562
Some people.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.064
Some people?

13:20.066 --> 13:22.066
They're not going to talk
to the police.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.568
They know the people involved.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.671
The whole neighborhood

13:26.673 --> 13:29.040
know what happened.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.911
The whole neighborhood know
you grabbed the wrong guy.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.946
Well, unless the whole
neighborhood wants to testify,

13:34.948 --> 13:38.249
you're wasting my time.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.351
Let's go.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.677
Where you going?

14:05.679 --> 14:08.680
To get a piece of cake
from the store.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.550
Get me one, too.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.139
Please don't let it be a cell.

15:32.531 --> 15:35.533
Let's go! On your gate!
On your count!

15:40.472 --> 15:42.740
This is docket 7442.

15:42.742 --> 15:46.044
Your honor, the people
are going to try Colin Warner

15:46.046 --> 15:49.280
and Anthony Gibson together
for the murder of Marvin Grant.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.316
I'm requesting that these cases
be consolidated

15:52.318 --> 15:54.385
under the original indictment.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.187
Request is granted.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.622
Are you the guy
that killed Marvin?

15:57.624 --> 15:58.823
Don't be asking me that.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.224
Ain't no concern of yours.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.294
But they're saying
I did it, man.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.595
You got to tell them
I'm innocent.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.696
I ain't saying
nothing like that.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.432
If they want to say
that I did it,

16:07.434 --> 16:08.533
they're gonna have to prove it.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.269
But they got me in here
for it, man.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.403
I don't know why you're here,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.138
but it ain't got nothing
to do with me.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.640
Come on, let's go!

16:37.597 --> 16:40.331
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:41.799
Happy new year!

16:45.371 --> 16:47.305
<i>Crime today is</i>

16:47.307 --> 16:48.873
an American epidemic.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.741
<i>The American people
are reasserting</i>

16:50.743 --> 16:53.377
<i>the belief that
right and wrong do matter</i>

16:53.379 --> 16:56.681
<i>and that retribution must be
swift and sure for those</i>

16:56.683 --> 16:58.549
who decide to make a career

16:58.551 --> 16:59.631
of preying on the innocent.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.888
<i>We move to adjourn for a month.</i>

17:04.891 --> 17:07.692
Where are the attorneys
for the defense?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.294
They're never here, your honor.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.863
What's going on with this case?

17:11.865 --> 17:13.631
We're preparing for trial.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.233
We've been unable
to locate the witness.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.234
You're referring
to Clarence Lewis?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.836
Yes, your honor.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.506
When was the last contact
with Mr. Lewis?

17:21.508 --> 17:22.772
18 months ago.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.208
18 months?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.019
That's correct.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.444
Well, you have two weeks
to be ready for trial,

17:27.446 --> 17:30.214
or I'm giving the defendants
a drastically low bail.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.516
Yes, your honor.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.811
Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.652
Open the fucking cash register!

18:07.654 --> 18:10.321
Open the fucking register!

18:10.323 --> 18:11.722
- Open...

18:31.276 --> 18:32.710
Colin?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.879
Bruce Regenstreich.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.951
The court appointed me
to represent you at trial.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.787
So they have the, uh,
the eyewitness in custody,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.356
and they want to move quickly
'cause of this judge.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.992
So the first hearing
is gonna be set for next week.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.527
They found our witness?

18:49.529 --> 18:51.295
Yeah. Yeah,
he was, uh, picked up

18:51.297 --> 18:52.730
on a robbery charge last night.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.966
Any idea why
he's implicating you?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.401
Nah. I don't even know him.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.836
And they got the guy who did it.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.439
- Oh, you mean Anthony?
- Yeah.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.641
- And you didn't know him?
- No.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.509
I don't know any of these guys.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.313
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with this.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.983
All right, look, um...

19:11.985 --> 19:15.853
These guys, they're stuck with
an impossible number of cases,

19:15.855 --> 19:17.922
and they just want convictions.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.358
And they'll throw
whatever they can at you.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.760
But right now they don't have
a lot to work with.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.462
Other than the eyewitness,
there's nothing.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.697
There's no motive, no weapon,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.799
there's no physical evidence.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.802
So this is a case
we can actually win.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.339
You've done murder cases before?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.375
I used to be a homicide D.A.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.544
That's all I did,
just for the other side.

19:51.691 --> 19:55.026
How old are you, Clarence?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.295
- 15.
- How old do you want to be

19:57.297 --> 19:59.463
when you get sent back to Haiti?

19:59.465 --> 20:02.300
You understand what he means?

20:02.302 --> 20:04.568
You're getting deported
when you get out of prison.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.337
You're not going back
to Brooklyn.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.506
Want to start your life over

20:08.508 --> 20:10.975
when you're 18
or when you're 40?

20:10.977 --> 20:14.045
We can make either of those
happen, but you got to pick.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.615
<i>Your honor,
the people call Clarence Lewis</i>

20:17.617 --> 20:19.784
to the stand.

20:29.361 --> 20:33.564
Clarence,
who was driving the car?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.934
- Colin.
- And who else was in the car?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.036
Anthony was
in the passenger seat.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.439
And what happened
when they stopped the car?

20:46.478 --> 20:48.512
Anthony shot him.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.014
You mean Colin?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.082
No.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.650
Anthony.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.886
Are you sure about that?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.055
Yes.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.829
No further questions.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.098
Uh, presently, Mr. Lewis,

21:07.100 --> 21:10.701
you're being charged with
armed robbery, is that correct?

21:11.737 --> 21:13.003
Yes.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.005
And did you know you can receive

21:15.007 --> 21:17.608
up to 25 years in prison
if you're convicted?

21:18.643 --> 21:20.811
- Yes.
- And, Mr. Lewis,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.813
did anybody from
the district attorney's office

21:22.815 --> 21:24.982
advise you that
if you testified in this case,

21:24.984 --> 21:26.517
that you'd receive
only two years?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.818
Were you ever advised of that?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.387
- Yes.
- Objection!

21:29.389 --> 21:30.855
So, by testifying
against Mr. Warner,

21:30.857 --> 21:32.957
you're receiving a dramatically
lower jail sentence.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.727
- Objection, your honor!
- Sustained.

21:36.729 --> 21:40.664
Mr. Lewis, when you first
spoke to detective Cassel,

21:40.666 --> 21:43.834
did you tell him that
Colin Warner shot Marvin Grant?

21:45.036 --> 21:46.604
Yes.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.606
But that wasn't true, was it?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.942
- No.
- You lied to detective Cassel?

21:51.944 --> 21:54.078
- Yes.
- And when you went before the grand jury,

21:54.080 --> 21:55.780
you knew in your mind,

21:55.782 --> 21:58.449
did you not, that Colin Warner
never shot Marvin Grant?

21:58.451 --> 21:59.650
Is that right?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.552
Yes.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.087
So you lied to the grand jury?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.791
- Yes.

22:08.927 --> 22:10.127
No further questions.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.929
<i>They're willing</i>

22:11.931 --> 22:14.031
to offer you two to five years.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.800
If you take this deal,

22:15.802 --> 22:17.735
they'll drop all the charges
against Colin.

22:17.737 --> 22:21.038
You understand?
You can't possibly get

22:21.040 --> 22:23.073
a lighter sentence
for second-degree murder.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.210
And Colin will walk free
right now.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.813
You want time to think about it?

22:28.815 --> 22:30.681
Yeah.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.155
Counsel,
have you made a decision?

22:38.157 --> 22:40.791
Your honor, my client
has refused the offer

22:40.793 --> 22:43.194
and maintains his plea
of not guilty before the court.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.709
I should be
going home right now!

22:58.711 --> 23:01.245
That kid didn't see nothing.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.481
He don't know shit!

23:03.483 --> 23:05.082
If you have the guts
to take a man's life,

23:05.084 --> 23:07.885
have the guts
to pay the penalty for it!

23:16.862 --> 23:18.929
<i>What's your relationship</i>

23:18.931 --> 23:20.865
to the victim?

23:20.867 --> 23:22.766
He was my brother.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.169
And were you close?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.238
Very. Yes.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.772
So it's safe to say you knew

23:28.774 --> 23:30.674
who your brother
was hanging around with?

23:30.676 --> 23:32.743
- Yes.
- Did you know Colin Warner

23:32.745 --> 23:37.147
and Anthony Gibson
before your brother was killed?

23:37.149 --> 23:38.883
Yes.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.286
Did you ever see them
with your brother Marvin?

23:42.288 --> 23:44.655
Yes, yes,
I had seen them around.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.757
And do you have reason
to believe

23:46.759 --> 23:50.027
they wanted to kill
your brother?

23:52.531 --> 23:54.798
- Yes.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.934
<i>Colin Warner</i>

23:56.936 --> 24:00.037
and Anthony Gibson set out,

24:00.039 --> 24:03.107
on April 10, 1980,
to kill Marvin Grant.

24:03.109 --> 24:07.111
It doesn't matter
who was driving the car.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.179
This was not
a random act of violence,

24:09.181 --> 24:11.282
this was premeditated murder.

24:12.817 --> 24:15.920
The defendants
were out for revenge,

24:15.922 --> 24:21.125
and when they gunned down
Marvin Grant in broad daylight,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.127
people saw them do it.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.972
<i>Has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

24:34.974 --> 24:37.174
Yes, your honor.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.944
The parties will please rise.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.881
And what is your finding?

24:43.883 --> 24:45.716
We find the defendant,
Anthony Gibson,

24:45.718 --> 24:47.685
guilty of murder
in the second degree.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.054
We find the defendant,
Colin Warner,

24:50.056 --> 24:52.590
guilty of murder
in the second degree.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.769
Is this verdict true?

25:07.906 --> 25:10.240
I don't pretend to know.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.078
I don't have the capacity

25:14.080 --> 25:16.313
to actually know.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.954
A life has been taken.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.057
The jury has spoken.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.393
In the case of Anthony Gibson,

25:29.395 --> 25:34.231
the court will give
the maximum juvenile sentence

25:34.233 --> 25:37.201
of nine years to life.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.170
In the case of Colin Warner,

25:40.172 --> 25:45.275
the court will give
the minimum allowable sentence

25:45.277 --> 25:47.911
of 15 years to life.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.149
You are hereby sentenced.

26:32.323 --> 26:34.324
Stop.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.962
Next!

26:41.132 --> 26:44.068
Arms out.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.374
Turn around.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.044
Next!

26:57.015 --> 26:58.482
Arms out.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.418
Arms out!

27:05.323 --> 27:07.324
Turn around!

27:10.829 --> 27:13.130
Next!

27:23.808 --> 27:26.477
Please don't let it be a cell.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.172
Ah, shit.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.908
Who's down? Who's down?
Need a medic up here. E-block.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.917
E-block. Get a stretcher
up here, please.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.352
<i>You never know</i>

28:08.354 --> 28:12.422
how sacred your freedom is
until it's jeopardized.

28:12.424 --> 28:17.060
<i>It feels like
I wasn't even a person.</i>

28:17.062 --> 28:19.062
<i>You feel unloved.</i>

28:21.833 --> 28:23.834
<i>You want it to stop,</i>

28:23.836 --> 28:26.837
<i>but my life
was not in my hands anymore.</i>

28:39.484 --> 28:43.353
Kc dropped off some money
for your commissary.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.123
I'll make sure
you don't run out.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.926
You okay?

28:48.928 --> 28:51.595
I just thought
they would be fair.

28:51.597 --> 28:55.199
I never thought they would do
this if you didn't do anything.

28:58.102 --> 29:01.905
I don't know you the way
a mother should know her son.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.474
I wanted to know you better,
I really wanted that.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.612
It's not your fault.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.480
It's okay.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.026
Come on, come on, come on.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.229
Listen.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.531
You and I are friends,

29:27.533 --> 29:30.334
but if something happens,
I can't protect you.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.536
Understand?

29:32.538 --> 29:36.073
You got to be with the other
west Indians for that.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.944
They eat out in the courts.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.578
You from Brooklyn?

30:14.580 --> 30:17.414
Yeah, from crown heights.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.583
We from Brownsville.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.357
You ain't taste anything
like that in a while?

30:27.359 --> 30:28.959
Mm-mm.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.261
Not since my grandmother
cook it.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.031
She come over with you?

30:34.033 --> 30:36.166
She never flew on a airplane.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.535
She never ride a bike.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.704
She never even wore pants.

30:43.107 --> 30:45.075
But she raised me like her son.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.178
Thank you.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.180
<i>Uh, Colin, I, uh,</i>

30:50.182 --> 30:51.715
I filed the initial appeal.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.952
I just, uh, wanted to let
you know that it went in.

30:54.954 --> 30:58.088
When will they notify us?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.290
Unfortunately,
it-it could take years.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.283
Let's pick up the pace, guys.

31:29.654 --> 31:32.322
Come on, man, keep it going.
Come on.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.324
Hey, I told you, keep moving.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.326
Come on.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.695
I said fucking go!

31:38.697 --> 31:40.397
Hey, hey, hey!

31:40.399 --> 31:42.032
Hey, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.166
Stay the fuck off me!

31:43.168 --> 31:44.568
- Calm down!
- You understand me?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.036
I'm not one
of your prisoners, man!

31:46.038 --> 31:47.704
You got to go back
to your cell right now.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.206
Go back to your cell right now.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.574
No, I'm an innocent man!

31:50.576 --> 31:52.509
Mr. Warner,
got to go back to your cell.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.211
- I'm an innocent man!
- If you don't start walking,

31:54.213 --> 31:55.579
he's gonna make your life hell
right now,

31:55.581 --> 31:57.314
and I don't want to see
nothing bad happen.

32:01.452 --> 32:04.321
<i>Got
to be careful with the guards.</i>

32:04.323 --> 32:07.124
They're small-minded.

32:07.126 --> 32:10.293
They'll never cut you no slack,
especially no killer like you.

32:10.295 --> 32:13.230
- I'm not no killer, man.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.565
I'm serious.
I never killed nobody.

32:17.168 --> 32:21.038
You had everyone saying
you did something.

32:23.341 --> 32:27.077
After a while,
you start to question yourself.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.551
Shit.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.725
- He's a fucking...
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:41.727 --> 32:42.727
Hey! Let go!

32:44.430 --> 32:46.263
Shut the fuck up.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.299
Yeah, try to catch me
in the shower, motherfucker.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.401
- Fucking faggot.
- Motherfucker!

32:51.403 --> 32:54.204
- Yo, what the fuck was that?
- That shit, man,

32:54.206 --> 32:56.206
don't pay it no mind.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.556
Trini <i> Maricón</i> gonna fucking die.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.558
It's payback time, motherfucker.

33:36.314 --> 33:37.848
Who did that to you?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.850
You don't know?

33:47.692 --> 33:50.527
You got something
you want to say to me?

33:50.529 --> 33:53.296
Look, I can't be associated
with the things you do.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.432
I could get killed for that.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.836
Then go inside and eat.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.239
You ain't have no more friends
in the courts.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.759
Brethren.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.695
It's a girl.

34:25.697 --> 34:29.466
I wish you could see her, man.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.405
She gonna know her uncle Colin,
all right?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.942
I promise you that.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.782
Congratulations, brethren.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.918
Thanks, man.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.223
Shh.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.876
<i>What's up, man?</i>

35:12.878 --> 35:15.312
I wanted to tell you this
in person, that, uh...

35:16.581 --> 35:19.583
the appeal was denied.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.551
They admitted
the evidence was weak.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.487
"Far from overwhelming."
That's the way they put it.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.723
But they still ruled against us.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.793
Well, there's potentially
other grounds for appeal,

35:29.795 --> 35:31.861
but you should find
an appellate attorney

35:31.863 --> 35:34.497
who does this
on a regular basis.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.742
<i>Sorry to bother you,</i>

35:45.744 --> 35:48.311
- but we're raising money for Colin's appeal.
- Oh.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.381
So anything you
could contribute would help.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.749
Here you are. Good luck.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.883
Thank you so much.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.885
Here, take this.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.529
- Kc!
- Antoinette.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.531
When'd you get back?

36:08.533 --> 36:11.001
I just got off active duty
last month.

36:11.003 --> 36:16.006
Hi. This is my daughter, Sasha.
Nice to meet you.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.008
What are you doing here?

36:18.010 --> 36:20.644
Uh, you remember Colin?

36:20.646 --> 36:22.746
Yeah, of course.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.048
He got arrested
for a murder he didn't do,

36:25.050 --> 36:26.916
and he's been upstate since.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.918
How long has he been in jail?

36:29.954 --> 36:31.821
Going on six years now.

36:32.412 --> 36:33.491
And he's innocent?

36:33.492 --> 36:38.728
They found the guy that did it,
but they still sent Colin away.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.349
You remember Antoinette?

37:01.018 --> 37:03.620
It's nice to see you.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.955
Been a long time.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.994
When the police arrested me
that night, that was it,

37:10.996 --> 37:13.496
I haven't been back home since.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.465
My life...

37:15.467 --> 37:17.567
Ended right there.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.570
You know, my family in Trinidad,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.972
I haven't seen any of them.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.042
<i>Most of these prisoners,</i>

37:26.044 --> 37:28.411
<i>they know deep down
they put themselves here.</i>

37:29.447 --> 37:32.782
<i>But I don't have that comfort.</i>

37:40.459 --> 37:41.591
<i>Yes?</i>

37:41.593 --> 37:44.627
- Hello?
- Hi, grandma. It's Colin.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.830
Oh, my god, Colin.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.898
I miss you so much.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.401
Yeah, I miss you, too.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.970
I called to, uh,
wish you a happy birthday.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.572
Another year older.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.641
Not sure I feel like
celebrating it.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.110
How is everyone?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.811
Everyone is doing fine.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.813
Your father's been working
at the school,

38:03.815 --> 38:05.682
coaching the teams and all that.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.884
- He talk about you all the time.
- Come on, you're done.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.120
- Let's go. Time's up. Come on, let's go.
- Hello?

38:10.122 --> 38:11.955
Please, I...
I just need one moment.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.623
- Colin?
- That's a direct order.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.625
Get off the fucking phone,
or you're getting written up.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.027
Are you still there?

38:18.029 --> 38:19.829
Is everything okay?

38:19.831 --> 38:22.699
Yeah, everything is fine,
grandma.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.867
But... but...

38:23.869 --> 38:25.869
What's that noise?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.604
I got to go.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.672
But, um, I just want you to know

38:29.674 --> 38:31.541
that I love you and I miss you.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.876
I love you, too.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.778
I'll tell your father
that you called.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.880
Any holdup?
Come on.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.992
Fuck you!

38:58.637 --> 39:01.104
Stand up.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.641
Remove your clothes.

39:07.211 --> 39:11.181
I said,
remove your fucking clothes.

39:38.742 --> 39:41.044
Mr. Warner, we will not
tolerate attacks on the staff.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.681
You're being sentenced to two
years in solitary confinement.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.870
<i>Colin...</i>

40:06.872 --> 40:10.540
<i>I want you to know that
I believe in your innocence.</i>

40:10.542 --> 40:13.243
<i>It's hard to accept
that I don't have the power</i>

40:13.245 --> 40:15.278
<i>to take you out of there,</i>

40:15.280 --> 40:18.681
<i>that the best thing
I can hope for</i>

40:18.683 --> 40:21.084
<i>is peace of mind.</i>

40:22.686 --> 40:25.154
<i>If you focus on your breathing,</i>

40:25.156 --> 40:29.926
<i>it'll bring you out of your
mind and back into your body.</i>

40:29.928 --> 40:33.263
<i>Just know
that you are not alone.</i>

40:43.240 --> 40:45.608
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

40:45.610 --> 40:48.077
Okay, let's go. Come on.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.913
Come on.

41:02.327 --> 41:05.695
<i>I will keep
America moving forward,</i>

41:05.697 --> 41:07.564
<i>always forward,</i>

41:07.566 --> 41:10.199
<i>for a better America,</i>

41:10.201 --> 41:12.669
<i>for an endless enduring dream</i>

41:12.671 --> 41:14.871
and a thousand points of light.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.873
This is my mission,

41:16.875 --> 41:19.108
and I will complete it.

42:42.259 --> 42:44.260
<i>I get to realize now</i>

42:44.262 --> 42:48.197
<i>that prison
is more mental than physical.</i>

42:48.199 --> 42:50.967
<i>I have the power
to at least control</i>

42:50.969 --> 42:53.102
<i>certain little things.</i>

42:53.104 --> 42:57.173
<i>I refuse to become
what they label me.</i>

42:57.175 --> 43:00.943
<i>That wasn't part of me.</i>

43:00.945 --> 43:03.179
<i>I tell myself,
go back and fight,</i>

43:03.181 --> 43:05.081
<i>get out.</i>

43:06.884 --> 43:08.985
I need to go to the law library.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.120
Okay. I'll put you down.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.424
Thanks.

43:17.161 --> 43:20.163
<i>The truth
cannot be hidden forever.</i>

43:20.165 --> 43:23.466
<i>My goal was: Clear my name.</i>

43:23.468 --> 43:27.270
<i>And I know I have to live
to clear my name.</i>

43:39.983 --> 43:41.984
<i>I was looking through</i>

43:41.986 --> 43:44.921
<i>these old photo albums, and...</i>

43:44.923 --> 43:46.355
I found these.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.026
Oh, my god.

43:51.028 --> 43:52.762
Look at this.

43:58.203 --> 44:01.070
Do you remember that day, um,

44:01.072 --> 44:03.473
I fell off my bike?

44:03.475 --> 44:06.209
It was right by Kingston park,
and I was lying there

44:06.211 --> 44:08.878
all banged up, and you saw me,

44:08.880 --> 44:11.180
and you took me by the arm,

44:11.182 --> 44:14.484
and you carried my bike
all the way home.

44:16.520 --> 44:20.022
I always knew
you were a good kid.

44:28.866 --> 44:31.033
<i>I spoke to the lawyer,</i>

44:31.035 --> 44:33.336
but they're
not gonna take the case.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.538
They read over
the brief you wrote,

44:35.540 --> 44:38.541
but they don't think
there's enough for an appeal.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.176
But listen, man,
I got another lawyer

44:40.178 --> 44:42.845
who gonna take a look at it,
all right?

44:42.847 --> 44:44.280
Thanks.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.460
<i>Colin, I know in my heart</i>

44:57.462 --> 44:59.529
<i>there's justice for you.</i>

44:59.531 --> 45:01.998
<i>There is good in this world.</i>

45:02.000 --> 45:05.134
<i>And there are people out here
who love you.</i>

45:05.136 --> 45:08.304
<i>If nothing else,
have faith in us.</i>

45:08.306 --> 45:11.140
<i>And when you walk
out of those prison gates,</i>

45:11.142 --> 45:13.109
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

45:13.111 --> 45:15.444
<i>Yours, Antoinette.</i>

45:18.148 --> 45:20.249
People in Colin's situation

45:20.251 --> 45:22.418
rarely get a competent defense
at trial.

45:22.420 --> 45:25.021
The system doesn't work
for people who can't afford

45:25.023 --> 45:26.255
to defend themselves.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.157
- Right.
- So what we do is

45:28.159 --> 45:30.159
look for mistakes
that were made at trial

45:30.161 --> 45:32.228
that could invalidate
a conviction.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.064
And what if you don't find
any mistakes?

45:35.066 --> 45:37.366
We already found several
in our preliminary review.

45:37.368 --> 45:39.936
There's more than enough
to work with here.

45:39.938 --> 45:41.314
All right.

45:41.339 --> 45:45.441
Well, I'm gonna need some time
to put the money together.

45:45.443 --> 45:48.377
Here's $2,000
from the church groups.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.450
That just puts us

45:54.452 --> 45:56.319
over $10,000.

45:57.621 --> 46:00.423
We're still five short.

46:00.425 --> 46:03.259
I can float the rest.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.127
Are you sure about that?

46:06.163 --> 46:08.030
Yeah.

46:08.032 --> 46:11.200
<i>Lead story:
Today president Clinton signed</i>

46:11.202 --> 46:13.870
<i>the crime bill into law,
closing the chapter</i>

46:13.872 --> 46:16.472
<i>on his largest
legislative victory to date.</i>

46:16.474 --> 46:17.874
<i>Longer sentences,</i>

46:17.876 --> 46:19.876
<i>three strikes and you're out,</i>

46:19.878 --> 46:22.912
<i>60 new capital punishment

46:22.914 --> 46:25.381
more prisons, more prevention,

46:25.383 --> 46:27.483
a hundred thousand more police.

46:27.485 --> 46:28.985
Baby.

46:28.987 --> 46:33.089
What's this
$5,000 line of credit?

46:34.091 --> 46:36.225
We didn't take this out?

46:44.034 --> 46:46.636
I had to pull some funds
for the appeal.

46:46.638 --> 46:48.971
How are we gonna afford this?

46:48.973 --> 46:51.107
There's about to be
four of us soon,

46:51.109 --> 46:53.476
and we're already behind
on everything as it is.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.411
I picked up extra hours at work.

46:55.413 --> 46:58.281
And I'm gonna work weekends
at the other garage.

46:58.283 --> 46:59.949
When were you gonna tell me
about this?

46:59.951 --> 47:01.918
Babe, I didn't want you
to worry.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.121
You have enough to think about.

47:10.295 --> 47:12.461
It's this one right here.

49:28.565 --> 49:31.200
Congratulations, son.

49:41.478 --> 49:46.449
Your honor, uh,
the, uh, first lawyer

49:46.451 --> 49:48.551
made several motions.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.556
I-if you'll just,
uh, bear with me.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.592
Your honor, we-we did find,
uh, two instances

49:56.594 --> 49:58.861
in which the trial lawyer,

49:58.863 --> 50:02.832
appropriately, uh,
called for a mistrial. Um...

50:02.834 --> 50:05.167
Mr. Logan,
would you please proceed?

50:05.169 --> 50:06.335
Sorry.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.536
I think, uh...

50:07.538 --> 50:10.106
I think I might have it.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.574
I'm sorry.

50:11.576 --> 50:14.276
I don't... think we'll get
any traction with this judge.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.611
How do you expect him to listen

50:15.613 --> 50:18.247
when you don't have
the facts of the case down?

50:18.249 --> 50:20.382
This is a man's life
you're dealing with.

50:20.384 --> 50:23.185
We presented the strongest
grounds for appeal.

50:23.187 --> 50:26.689
If you don't agree, feel free
to seek other counsel.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.691
With what money?

50:28.693 --> 50:32.194
I'll let you know
when I receive a formal ruling.

50:54.352 --> 50:55.784
Hello?

50:55.786 --> 50:57.887
Hey. How'd it go?

51:03.293 --> 51:06.195
They ain't hearing it.

51:09.933 --> 51:12.334
I'm sorry, dread.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.571
We're gonna keep fighting
for you.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.741
Whatever it takes.

51:18.743 --> 51:21.210
I should get going.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.612
Thank you, brethren.

51:44.768 --> 51:46.769
<i>I will be putting before</i>

51:46.771 --> 51:49.505
the legislature measures
to eliminate work release

51:49.507 --> 51:51.707
and abolish parole
for violent felons.

51:51.709 --> 51:55.711
- Violent felons belong in jail.

51:57.414 --> 51:59.415
Let me also note,

51:59.417 --> 52:01.684
I will ask
the legislature to pass

52:01.686 --> 52:04.954
and I will sign and enforce
the death penalty.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.400
Hey, kc!

52:19.936 --> 52:22.738

- All right.

52:24.408 --> 52:25.874
All right.

52:25.876 --> 52:29.912
Got to go to the courthouse
by Cadman Plaza.

52:29.914 --> 52:32.648
Got a case?

Nah, man. Not for me.

Sure.

We'll be finding a real office

53:48.459 --> 53:49.825
- once we're a little more up
and running. -

53:49.827 --> 53:51.760
got it. Thanks.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.462
Thank you.

54:24.461 --> 54:27.463
It's over now.

54:28.865 --> 54:31.066
As soon as you go
before that parole board,

54:31.068 --> 54:33.736
you're gonna be a free man.

54:33.738 --> 54:36.605
And I'm gonna take you home.

54:44.514 --> 54:47.850
It's just a matter of time.

54:49.419 --> 54:51.754
<i>Do you take this man</i>

54:51.756 --> 54:55.090
to be your husband, to have and
to hold from this day forward,

54:55.092 --> 54:57.960
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

54:57.962 --> 55:01.497
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

55:01.499 --> 55:03.799
I do.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.809
By virtue of the authority
vested in me

55:13.811 --> 55:15.477
under the laws
of the state of New York,

55:15.479 --> 55:18.947
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

55:29.192 --> 55:31.660
It's time.

56:53.743 --> 56:56.678
Morning. You're Colin Warner?

56:56.680 --> 56:58.680
Yes, sir.

57:00.149 --> 57:03.519
You were found guilty
of murder, second degree,

57:03.521 --> 57:04.920
by a jury verdict,
is that right?

57:04.922 --> 57:06.622
Yes, sir.

57:06.624 --> 57:09.224
You've now done 15 years?

57:09.226 --> 57:10.826
Yes.

57:12.829 --> 57:16.031
Why the shooting, Mr. Warner?

57:16.033 --> 57:18.567
Mr. Rafello,
I didn't commit this crime.

57:18.569 --> 57:21.069
I've been wrongfully
incarcerated for 15 years,

57:21.071 --> 57:22.938
and all I want is my freedom...

57:22.940 --> 57:25.207
But... I'm sorry
to interrupt you...

57:25.209 --> 57:30.746
Your criminal record
goes back to 1979.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.814
And in your disciplinary record,

57:32.816 --> 57:34.750
you've been written up
for assaults

57:34.752 --> 57:37.920
on both inmates and staff,
possession of weapons,

57:37.922 --> 57:40.589
and a host of other charges,
all of which would indicate

57:40.591 --> 57:44.927
that you are, in fact,
a very violent person.

57:44.929 --> 57:47.930
I was arrested
when I was 18 years old.

57:47.932 --> 57:50.933
And being that I was innocent,
it was just very difficult

57:50.935 --> 57:54.002
for me to adjust to...
Prison life.

57:54.004 --> 57:56.872
But I've since addressed
that issue.

57:56.874 --> 58:00.075
I got my ged. I got two years
of community college.

58:00.077 --> 58:03.011
I'm helping guys get
their geds down.

58:03.013 --> 58:04.613
I'm a teacher's aide.

58:04.615 --> 58:08.150
You've addressed a problem
by accumulating

58:08.152 --> 58:11.954
1,284 days
in solitary confinement,

58:11.956 --> 58:14.823
where it was recommended
that you lose

58:14.825 --> 58:16.625
two years of good time.

58:16.627 --> 58:18.627
Sir, I didn't ask to be here.

58:18.629 --> 58:20.629
I didn't even commit a crime
to put me here.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.064
Mr. Warner,

58:22.066 --> 58:24.333
a jury in a court
of competent jurisdiction

58:24.335 --> 58:25.734
says you did,

58:25.736 --> 58:29.071
and that's what we follow.

58:29.073 --> 58:31.740
You want to continue
to fight this issue,

58:31.742 --> 58:33.909
by all means,
get yourself an attorney,

58:33.911 --> 58:35.310
take it to the court of appeals,

58:35.312 --> 58:37.079
take it
to the U.S. supreme court,

58:37.081 --> 58:38.981
take it to wherever you will.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.749
But until a court
of higher jurisdiction says

58:40.751 --> 58:42.684
that you are innocent,
as far as we're concerned,

58:42.686 --> 58:45.020
you are guilty of murder.

58:45.022 --> 58:48.957
So I need you to be aware that
your protestations of innocence

58:48.959 --> 58:50.892
fall on deaf ears.

58:50.894 --> 58:54.696
Now, can you explain
your violent behavior

58:54.698 --> 58:56.398
while you were in prison?

58:56.400 --> 58:58.100
You don't accept my reasons?

58:58.102 --> 58:59.301
That's quite right.

58:59.303 --> 59:01.303
I don't accept those reasons.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.672
They may be excuses...
Damn poor ones, at that...

59:03.674 --> 59:05.340
But they're
certainly not reasons.

59:05.342 --> 59:07.409
And if you don't know
the difference between a reason

59:07.411 --> 59:10.078
and an excuse, then, sir,
I suggest you look it up

59:10.080 --> 59:11.413
in a dictionary.

59:11.415 --> 59:15.384
For this panel
to Grant parole now would

59:15.386 --> 59:17.185
so diminish the gravity
of the crime

59:17.187 --> 59:19.788
as to undermine respect
for the law.

59:19.790 --> 59:23.191
Mr. Warner is denied parole.

59:30.066 --> 59:32.834
- You know, we can find another way.
- No.

59:32.836 --> 59:35.971
- We can. We're gonna...
- They're not gonna let me out.

59:35.973 --> 59:36.938
I won't accept it.

59:36.940 --> 59:39.174
You have to accept it.

59:39.176 --> 59:42.878
You got to stop coming up here.

59:42.880 --> 59:46.281
You asked me to be your wife.

59:47.684 --> 59:50.686
You don't just give up on that.

59:50.688 --> 59:52.154
What do I have to give up on?

59:52.156 --> 59:55.157
They took everything from me!
Everything!

59:55.159 --> 59:58.293
And they gonna keep me in here
until I say I killed that man.

59:58.295 --> 01:00:01.363
You know I will die
before I do that!

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.413
Hello?

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:21.083
Brethren,
you have to stop all of this.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:23.285
You got to stop trying
to get me out.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.454
- You need to just forget about this.
- Listen...

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.789
We got to stop it, all right?
I cannot keep stringing

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.257
Antoinette along in this either.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.859
Just stop coming up here.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:33.195
You're never gonna get me out.
All right?

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.197
- Brethren...
- Do you understand me?!

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.265
I said stop! Just stop this!

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:39.267
- Brethren, listen...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:27.449
<i>I'm gonna do
the next appeal myself.</i>

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:30.986
Brethren, I know what to do now.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.488
If we keep reaching
for legal technicalities,

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.957
we ain't gonna get no rhythm.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.492
There's not a judge in Brooklyn

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:39.895
who's gonna let you out
on murder charges

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:41.930
unless he thinks
you're innocent.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:44.466
But we have to do
our own investigation

01:01:44.468 --> 01:01:47.402
and show them
what really happened.

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:52.073
Brethren,
you didn't kill that man.

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.576
We should be able to prove it.

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:57.112
Why you still at this, man?

01:01:57.114 --> 01:02:00.148
You got your family,
you got your job,

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.217
you got your life.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:06.054
You know? Why you... why you
keep wasting your time on me?

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.057
It's not just about you.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.061
It's bigger than that.

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:21.603
It could be me in here.

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:30.979
Sometimes I feel like it is me.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.285
I need to talk to you.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.287
Come on in.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:47.095
I have a friend who's in jail
for a murder he didn't commit.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.065
He's been locked up
for more than 15 years now,

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.535
and we can't get no justice
for him.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:56.538
Everything we do comes up short.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.208
And he's got no fight left
in him.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:04.079
I'll work for free
if you take a look at his case.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.414
Do you have his court records?

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.216
Yeah.

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:12.254
Okay.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.589
Bring everything you have
next time you come.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:17.425
I got it all in my car
right now.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.996
Look here.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:23.131
The witness mentioned Anthony
again.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.934
Anthony actually told people
he was going to kill Marvin.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:28.470
There's no murder weapon,

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.171
no forensics.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:34.109
The autopsy report
doesn't make any sense.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:36.978
How could the bullet have
a downward trajectory

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.147
if it was a drive-by shooting?

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.150
If this is all they had, the
prosecution's work is sloppy

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.453
to the point of being unethical.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.457
<i>I found a release record</i>

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.459
for Anthony Gibson.

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:55.063
First time he was up
for parole, they let him out.

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:57.599
The eyewitness,
Clarence Lewis, was deported

01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:02.270
back to Haiti after serving
six years for armed robbery.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.507
We have a statement from
the victim's brother, Leon,

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:10.211
who says he was on the scene
moments after the shooting.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.213
Now, the other potential
witness who stands out,

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:15.617
Clayton Benton,
goes by "massup,"

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.619
told the police he was there

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:21.089
when Marvin was shot,
but he didn't see anything.

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:22.090
Hmm.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.559
Whatever the truth is,

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.594
these kids know it.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.469
Come on.

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:40.475
You gonna be good today?

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.211
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.146
All right.

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.451
So serious.

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.453
Could I have a kiss?

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.323
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.492
I'll pick you up after school.

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:02.063
Jim,

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.733
I need you to pull
someone's record.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:14.242
I pulled his criminal record.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.643
Ins, DMV.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.579
It's all in there.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.048
He's got a warrant on a grand
larceny charge in Brooklyn,

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.185
and ins has an open
deportation order against him.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.254
He didn't show for any of
his court dates, and he skipped

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.622
on his bond.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.609
Hold the door, please.

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:43.231
Where you been all day?

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:48.470
Working.

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:50.472
Working?

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.845
What's wrong with you?

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:58.379
What you talking about?

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:01.382
Your daughter waited outside
for an hour

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:03.718
before the school called me
at work.

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:08.790
You think that's safe?

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.792
Our little girl standing outside

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:13.294
on the street like that?

01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:17.265
You can't tell me
you care more about Colin

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.267
- than you do your own children.
- You know that ain't true.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:22.604
Then why you do things
like this?

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.806
You know what my mother thinks?

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:28.810
She thinks you killed that guy
and Colin get caught for it.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.812
She can't think
of any other reason

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:32.580
why you would keep this up
for so long.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.583
What you want me to do, Briana?
You want me to leave him?

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:42.357
I can't just pretend
this situation doesn't exist.

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:45.160
Yeah, well,
this situation exists, too.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:48.696
You better hurry up
and figure that out.

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:05.346
I'm sorry.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.237
Hello. You have reached the law
offices of William S. Robedee.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.904
- Please leave a message

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:05.673
- and we'll return your call.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.009
Uh, hey, this is,
uh, Leon Grant.

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:10.778
Look, I'm not gonna be able
to help you with your case.

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:13.381
Uh... I just wanted to...

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:15.817
Reach out and respond
to your letter.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.685
Leon, don't hang up.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.889
Leon, are you there?

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:24.658
Yeah.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.527
Thank you so much for calling.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.464
Look, look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not gonna be able to help you.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.566
I wouldn't remember anything
anyway, that was so long ago.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.568
Please, just hear me out.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.471
I'm very sorry
about your brother,

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:40.742
and I don't want to drudge
this up for you, but...

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:43.411
They have the wrong guy
in prison.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.747
Colin Warner didn't do it.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.750
If you look
at the autopsy report,

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.386
this wasn't a drive-by;
It couldn't have been.

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:54.422
It didn't happen
the way the police said it did.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.357
Clarence Lewis lied,

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.960
and an innocent man
is doing a life sentence.

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:01.529
I can't imagine what you and
your family have gone through,

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.531
but this doesn't help
your brother.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.533
<i>I was around the corner</i>

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:06.634
<i>from my high school...</i>

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:11.072
when, um, Clarence Lewis
came up on his bike,

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:13.007
and he said,

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:14.642
"your brother got shot!

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.611
Your brother Marvin,
he got shot!"

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:20.014
He said, "I saw what happened."

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:25.386
<i>I thought I was outside
of my body, 'cause...</i>

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:29.057
<i>I couldn't believe that
my brother had got shot.</i>

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:32.460
<i>Police asked me
if I knew anybody</i>

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:34.495
who might want
to kill my brother,

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:36.497
and I said,
"no, but my friend here said

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.565
he saw what happened."

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.334
From that moment on,

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.602
they held on to Clarence Lewis
as a witness.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:44.405
Were you present
when they interviewed him?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.741
<i>Yeah. They took us
down to the precinct, and...</i>

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:49.477
<i>I sat in the hallway
while they interviewed him.</i>

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.846
They showed him mug shots
for hours.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.724
<i>Eventually, he just...</i>

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:05.460
<i>Pointed at somebody's picture.</i>

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:07.061
You mean Colin Warner?

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.098
Yeah.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:13.534
<i>I remember detective Cassel</i>

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:16.404
<i>raising his voice at Clarence.</i>

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.139
"Did you see him with a gun?!"

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:21.576
Clarence said,
"no, I... I don't see no gun."

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.980
And he said...
"What do you mean

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:28.015
<i>"you don't see a gun?!</i>

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.817
<i>"If he killed him,
he had to have a gun!</i>

01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:31.486
<i>Did you see a gun?!"</i>

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:35.089
Clarence, you could hear his...

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.525
Voice quivering.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.993
"I-i-i guess.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.595
"I-i guess, yeah.

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:42.530
Yeah, I-i guess he had a gun."

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:45.400
But I think at that point
he just wanted to go home.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.770
- Were you ever questioned by detective Cassel?
- Yeah.

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:50.738
He came by my house
the next day,

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.674
<i>and he laid out four photos
on the table,</i>

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:57.678
<i>and he said, "do you know
any of these guys?"</i>

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.015
<i>And I said, "no, I don't know
any of these guys."</i>

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:03.618
And then he pushed
Colin Warner's photo

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.454
<i>out of the lineup.</i>

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.423
"You don't know this guy?

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:10.191
You never seen
this guy before?"

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:12.460
And I said...

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:14.162
"I might have."

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:16.731
You know,
"I might have seen him before."

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.467
I... the only reason

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:22.570
I said that was
'cause he was badgering me.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:25.573
I wanted him to stop, so I told
him what he wanted to hear.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.210
And then he said,

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:32.079
"well, that's the guy
who shot your brother."

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:37.618
And then he...

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.955
Took up the photos
and walked out the house.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:51.666
<i>I need to track
down a Haitian citizen.</i>

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:53.668
His name is Clarence Lewis.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:56.070
This is his deportation record.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:58.606
He was sent back to Haiti
in 1988

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:00.141
when he was released from jail.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.009
Are you a relative?

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:05.580
No, but I'm investigating
a case he's involved with.

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.014
I'm sorry.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:10.218
We cannot give that information
out to non-relative

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.753
- without authorization.
- This is incredibly important.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:15.556
Can you please just see
if there's an address for him?

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.992
- I'm sorry, I really can't.
- Listen, this man lied

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:20.561
and put my husband in jail
for 20 years,

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.564
and I need him to come forward.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.132
Please.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:41.048
He's listed as deceased.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:45.887
It says he was murdered
in port-au-prince in 1994.

01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:47.955
I'm so sorry.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.294
Thank you.

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.702
- Hello?
- This is Anthony Gibson.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:03.704
I got your letter
about Colin Warner.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:05.806
Could you hang on one second?

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.675
Bill?

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.710
- Bill!
- Yeah?

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:12.313
It's Anthony.

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:14.949
Do you remember
the events of April 10, 1980?

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.587
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:22.156
And my cousin had been shot
a few days before.

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:24.258
When you left the house
with a gun,

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:28.062
what were you intending to do?

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.131
I had every intention
of killing Marvin.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.899
Or anybody else who was involved

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.668
with killing my cousin.

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.340
- Yo, Marvin, wait up.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:41.676
Yo, Marvin!

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:45.880
I heard Spangler's dead, man.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.848
You know who did it?

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:52.119
<i>Can you show us
how you shot him?</i>

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.767
<i>I touched the back
of Marvin's head with the gun.</i>

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.793
And that was that.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.933
Was Clarence Lewis present?

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:40.701
No, he was not.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.004
He lied at the trial.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:45.006
What about his testimony
was a lie?

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.140
Everything.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.009
He wasn't there.

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:52.046
You know, the real witnesses,
they never took the stand.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.282
When was it you first heard
of Colin Warner?

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.821
You know, right after my arrest,

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:03.758
they showed me his picture
at the precinct...

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.127
And asked me if I knew him.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:09.263
And I tell them I never seen
this man before in my life.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.979
I want to talk to you
about the case.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.748
- Anthony show up?
- Yeah, he came in today.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.750
Then that's it, then, right?
You got everything you need.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:33.688
That's... that's what
I want to talk to you about.

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.223
We need a witness
to come forward.

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.959
You really need to keep
dragging people into this?

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.828
No, it's not that simple.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.098
You see, Anthony's statement
doesn't have any legal merit.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.134
You can't try someone twice
for the same crime.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:49.303
A judge will just look at it
and say...

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.939
He's just trying to get
his friend out of jail.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:54.208
You got to understand.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:56.410
We're asking the state to admit
that they were wrong.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:58.979
If they can find a way out,
they're gonna take it.

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:01.315
Look, this was 20 years ago.

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.819
I lost touch with those guys.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.887
I don't know none of them guys
no more.

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:08.422
What about massup?

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:10.424
Oh.

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:17.465
I haven't seen that guy
since my brother died.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:20.201
I mean, I saw him
in the street one time.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:22.369
H-he wouldn't even look at me.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:24.772
I wouldn't know
where to find him.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.440
He lives in the Bronx.

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:28.042
I know his apartment.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:29.977
<i>Okay, give me a kiss.</i>

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:35.816
No, no, Hoppy stays with me.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.919
I'll pick you up at 3:00, okay?

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.221
Okay.

01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:52.032
There he go, right there.

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.387
Yo, massup.

01:18:14.422 --> 01:18:16.357
Who are you?

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:18.259
You not remember me?

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:20.895
Nah.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:22.463
Me Marvin brother.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:25.065
You not remember Marvin?

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.278
Me can't forget Marvin, man.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.446
Marvin me brethren.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:44.285
Marvin was the first man me walk
with when me come to New York.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:48.022
He was the first man I see
get killed in front of me.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:49.356
If you was there,
why you do nothin'?!

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.258
Brethren,
what could I have done, huh?

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.527
I live amongst them.

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:56.230
And they'd come after me, too.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:19:00.000
You got to remember, man,
back then we were young.

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:04.004
We thought we were men,
but we were just kids.

01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:06.073
Why you here, man?

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:10.845
That man Colin is still in jail.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:11.939
Aw, man...

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:15.216
I got too many problems to be
getting involved with that.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.617
Now, you know he had nothing
to do with it!

01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:18.586
Do not come back here!

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.637
Briana?

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:02.229
Hello. You've reached Briana
at the right number

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:03.597
but the wrong time.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.538
Hello. You've reached Briana
at the right number

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.673
but the wrong time.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.108
Leave a message.

01:20:19.547 --> 01:20:22.683
Nine, eight, seven,

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:25.119
six, five, four,

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:26.687
three, two...

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:30.257
Happy new year, 2001!

01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.332
<i>I wanted to tell you that</i>

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.968
<i>I didn't know your brother,
but there were nights</i>

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.605
where I would just stay up
thinking about him.

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:49.977
I don't know what I did
to put me here,

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:52.212
but...

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:55.683
I would pray to him
at night, man...

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:59.353
And hope that he was at peace.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:40.127
Hello. -Yeah,
I'm sorry to call you so late,

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:41.628
but I found something.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.599
Have you ever come across
a witness named Hassan Wilton?

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.434
No. Who's that?

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:50.270
I found a transcript
from his grand jury testimony

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.639
that says
he was with Clarence Lewis

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:56.210
at the time of the shooting.

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:59.446
- So that means he...
- He saw whatever Clarence saw.

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:01.148
That's right.

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.020
Nope.

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:09.523
I got no records
for Hassan Wilton.

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:12.226
- You sure?
- There's nothing there.

01:22:21.905 --> 01:22:22.804
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:26.373
I'm trying to track down
someone you might know.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:32.813
Brethren.

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:41.188
This is a friend
of Colin Warner's.

01:22:45.693 --> 01:22:48.395
Whatever you're
gonna do to me, do it.

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:51.698
I'll go with you, but...

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.371
I want you to tell Colin
I'm sorry.

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.308
Those cops, they used me.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.178
I'm 15 years old.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.180
I didn't have the brains
to analyze shit,

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:07.648
and it fucked me up, now.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.316
Brethren, brethren...

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.685
He's not here to hurt you.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.788
We're gonna get him out.

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:19.159
That man's still in jail?

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:21.495
20 years now.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.341
Can you walk me through

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.177
what happened on April 10, 1980?

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.179
Yeah. I was, um...

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.215
Hanging around
Erasmus high school.

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:42.649
<i>I was with Clarence Lewis</i>

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:45.352
<i>and a couple other kids
from the neighborhood.</i>

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.635
Six, seven, eight, nine.
Two up to three, four, five...

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.228
<i>Were you close enough</i>

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:56.630
<i>to see where the shot was fired?</i>

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.901
<i>No, we were not.</i>

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.238
<i>We were around the corner.</i>

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.539
<i>Did the police</i>

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.542
ever come to talk to you?

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:12.246
Two weeks after the shooting,
they came to my house.

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:14.781
They gave me, uh...

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:19.186
Orange juice and a candy bar.

01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:21.421
Then they showed me a photo
of Colin Warner

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.925
and said that he was the one
that shot Marvin Grant.

01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:28.162
Then they said we had to go
down to the precinct, but...

01:24:28.164 --> 01:24:30.297
We never made it
to the precinct.

01:24:30.299 --> 01:24:32.399
The next thing I knew,
I was being questioned

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.201
in front of a grand jury.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.336
<i>Do you remember
what you testified to</i>

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:38.405
<i>in front of the grand jury?</i>

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:41.375
<i>I said what they told me to say.</i>

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:44.278
What does that mean, exactly?

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.749
It means I said
that Colin was the shooter.

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:51.418
That I saw him do it.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.587
And, you know,
I never seen Colin.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.222
I-I don't know Colin.

01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:58.725
And the way they
was questioning me, like...

01:24:58.727 --> 01:25:01.895
Like I was the shooter,
like I did something wrong.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.334
They told me what to say.

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:11.838
So that's what I said.

01:25:17.478 --> 01:25:20.981
It's all in there, brethren.

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:23.650
There's no way
anyone could look at this

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:26.687
and deny your innocence now.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.423
We finally have
everything we need.

01:25:31.427 --> 01:25:33.360
Listen, we got to take a picture

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:34.428
for the press real quick.

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:35.629
For who?

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.864
I have a media strategy.

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.471
Yo, stop looking
like you killed someone.

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:53.714
<i>Hello. New York 1 news.</i>

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:55.282
<i>Yeah,
I have some new information</i>

01:25:55.284 --> 01:25:56.550
<i>about a murder case,
and I would like</i>

01:25:56.552 --> 01:25:58.552
to speak to a reporter, please.

01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:02.856
Thank you.

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.862
Uh, let me call you back.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.371
Kings county.

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:19.406
Yes, this is Diane Cardwell
from the <i> New York times.</i>

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:21.041
Can you connect me
to the Brooklyn D.A.'S office?

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:23.844
- Ten seconds. Scene center?
- Scene center, go.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:26.647
Four, three, two, one.

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:29.449
Joining us now by phone from
Clinton correctional facility

01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:30.851
is Colin Warner.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:33.487
Now, I understand
you were arrested in 1980.

01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:35.289
Once you're convicted,
there's no longer

01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:38.425
a presumption of innocence,
if there ever was.

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:40.394
There's a presumption of guilt,

01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:42.963
and the state will try to knock
you down until you give up.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:44.765
So you have
to have a strong foundation

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:46.767
to stand firm and fight.

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:49.569
I was arrested
when I was 18 years old...

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.571
Brooklyn D.A.'S office.

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:53.373
- Yeah, Barry paged me.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.309
Bob, uh, we've got an appeal

01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.810
I want you to investigate.

01:26:56.812 --> 01:26:58.011
Colin Warner?

01:26:58.013 --> 01:26:59.479
You got to be kidding me.

01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:00.847
He's on New York 1 right now.

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:02.516
I've been
wrongfully incarcerated

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:04.451
for over 21 years now.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:06.987
My life was taken
from me unjustly,

01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:09.589
and we're finally able
to prove it.

01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:11.858
Now, I understand
you were denied parole.

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.927
They won't let me out
unless I express remorse

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:16.363
for a crime
that I did not commit.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:18.098
And I'm not willing to do that.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.100
So I remain in prison.

01:27:20.102 --> 01:27:21.902
<i>"In the spring of 1980,</i>

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:24.471
<i>"Leon Grant's brother
was murdered in the flatbush</i>

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.340
"section of Brooklyn.
Years later,

01:27:26.342 --> 01:27:29.509
"Grant now says he helped put
an innocent man in jail.

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:31.845
"Mr. Warner's codefendant,
Anthony Gibson,

"has also come forward
with the startling admission

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:36.650
"that he acted alone.

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:38.852
<i>The Brooklyn D.A.'S office
is reviewing the case."</i>

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:41.388
You had your blood
pressure taken before, right?

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.523
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Same thing.

01:27:43.525 --> 01:27:46.860
Now, you know, if you lie to me,

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:49.863
your buddy's gonna stay
in prison.

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.400
You understand?

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:55.569
Okay.

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:58.572
Were you with Clarence Lewis
at the time of the shooting?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:00.474
Yes.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:02.843
Did you see the shooting
take place?

01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:06.713
No, we were, uh,
several blocks away.

01:28:06.715 --> 01:28:09.583
Let me ask this another way.

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:13.053
Is there any way that

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:16.890
Clarence Lewis could have
witnessed the shooting?

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.065
Hello.

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:28.068
We've been called back
to the court tomorrow.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.139
I thought we were set for may.

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:34.674
We were.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:58.064
The court is in session.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.066
Please rise.

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.440
Counsel is present.

01:29:06.442 --> 01:29:07.808
Go ahead, Mr. Snyder.

01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:10.677
Your honor,
based on our findings,

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:13.747
the people join in application
with the defense

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:17.451
to dismiss the indictment
and vacate the conviction

01:29:17.453 --> 01:29:18.852
- of Colin Warner.

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:26.193
Thank you.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:48.548
<i>After 21 years in prison</i>

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.550
for a crime he did not commit,

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.986
Colin Warner
will now be a free man.

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:55.188
<i>There's some things
we might not be able</i>

01:29:55.190 --> 01:29:58.191
to correct in life, but as far
as leaving an innocent man

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:00.961
in jail,
we can't let that stand.

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:02.195
This never should have happened.

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:03.663
<i>If Colin Warner</i>

01:30:03.665 --> 01:30:05.198
had lived in Texas

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.901
or Florida or Louisiana,

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:11.171
he would have been executed
long ago.

01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:13.707
Congratulations, dread.

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:16.009
Just saw the news.

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:22.709
Peace be, brethren.

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.812
Sign here.

01:32:09.256 --> 01:32:11.791
I knew it.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:27.774
I love you so much.

01:32:56.070 --> 01:33:00.874
<i>Please don't let it be a cell.</i>

01:33:15.157 --> 01:33:17.857
- Daddy, wake up.

<i>I'm not angry at nobody.</i>

01:33:34.710 --> 01:33:36.376
Everybody has a burden to bear.

01:33:36.378 --> 01:33:37.977
This is my burden.

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.780
And, hopefully,
I can become strong from this

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.115
and move on with my life.

<i>And I would like to tell</i>

01:33:55.263 --> 01:33:57.939
All those guys who are in
prison, who are claiming

01:33:57.964 --> 01:34:00.324
that they're innocent
not to stop fighting.
