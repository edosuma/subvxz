WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.903
-GILES: Previously.
-I think we screwed it up.

00:02.936 --> 00:07.240
She's just disoriented
from being tormented
in some hell dimension.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.210
Is that the kind of demon
you are, love?

00:09.243 --> 00:12.413
I don't know why
you can hit me,
but I'm not a demon.

00:12.445 --> 00:16.550
So you three have, what--
banded together
to be pains in my ass?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.818
We're your arch-nemesises.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.588
-Dawn, you need
to eat something.
-Thanks for your concern.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.423
Why is she
taking it out on you?

00:24.524 --> 00:26.227
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.995
WILLOW:
Are you saying
you're gonna leave me?

00:28.027 --> 00:29.730
BUFFY:
Willow has a problem.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.200
No more spells.
I'm finished.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.868
-I'm in love with you.
-You're in love with pain.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.436
You're afraid I'm gonna--

00:36.469 --> 00:38.271
-Things have changed.
-The only thing
that's different...

00:38.305 --> 00:40.274
is that I'm disgusted
with myself.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.845
(Banging)
(Objects Rattling)

00:45.878 --> 00:49.116
(Passionate Moaning)

00:59.226 --> 01:02.229
(Objects Smashing)
(Panting Continues)

01:12.772 --> 01:15.275
We missed the bed again.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.245
Lucky for the bed.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.783
Is this a new rug?

01:23.817 --> 01:27.787
No. Just looks different
when you're under it.
(Chuckles)

01:27.820 --> 01:31.591
(Sighs)
You know, this place is okay
for a hole in the ground.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.760
You fixed it up.

01:33.793 --> 01:38.632
Well, I ate a decorator once.
Maybe something stuck.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.968
I've been thinking about
doing something to my room.
Yeah?

01:42.002 --> 01:45.239
Yeah. I think the New Kids
on the Block posters
are starting to date me.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.875
(Chuckles)
Well, if you want, I can--

01:51.311 --> 01:53.281
Are we having a conversation?

01:53.313 --> 01:57.218
What? No. No.

01:58.951 --> 02:00.987
Maybe.
Hmm.

02:02.555 --> 02:04.692
What?

02:04.724 --> 02:08.627
Isn't this usually the part
where you kick me in the head
and run out, virtue fluttering?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.798
That's the plan,

02:10.830 --> 02:14.668
as soon as my legs
start working.
(Laughs)

02:17.704 --> 02:20.007
You were amazing.

02:22.509 --> 02:27.681
You got the job done yourself.
I was just trying to keep up.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.617
The things you do.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.853
The way you make it hurt
in all the wrong places.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.358
-I've never been
with such an animal.
-(Scoffs)

02:37.390 --> 02:39.992
I'm not an animal.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.861
You wanna see the bite marks?

02:43.764 --> 02:47.134
You know, it's late.
I should get home
before Dawn goes to sleep.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.704
And she's off.
Have you seen my underwear?

02:53.441 --> 02:56.877
What is this to you--
this thing we have?

02:56.909 --> 02:58.878
We don't have a thing.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.748
We have "this."
That's all.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.721
Do you even like me?

03:11.558 --> 03:13.126
Sometimes.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.365
But you like
what I do to you.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.079
Do you trust me?

03:35.483 --> 03:37.550
Never.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.889
How can I trust you
not to touch my stuff?

03:41.921 --> 03:46.192
Actually, living
with super villains
was not part of the deal.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.728
We're on the lam, moron.
It's not like we have a choice.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.633
This sucks.
Couldn't we have at least
gotten a lair with a view?

03:52.665 --> 03:57.538
Stop whining. Get your
sissy crap out of the way!
Hey, quit it!

03:57.570 --> 04:01.641
-Don't you curse me.
-Hey! Give me my bone!

04:01.675 --> 04:03.477
Andrew:
Ow. Ow. Ow.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.747
Hey!

04:06.780 --> 04:09.817
When you girls are done touching
each other, the cerebral
dampener is ready to be charged.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.151
Cool.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.290
Got the thing?

04:16.324 --> 04:18.425
Musk gland
of a Homja-Maleev demon.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.127
Oh! Ew! Fresh.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.632
All right. Stand back.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.206
(Speaking Foreign Language)

04:36.677 --> 04:38.512
(Continues)

04:44.451 --> 04:46.687
Okay.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.622
Ow.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.591
Gentlemen,
the cerebral dampener
is online.

04:51.625 --> 04:56.163
Now with this baby, we can
make any woman we desire
our willing sex slave.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.002
I know just where to start.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.141
(theme music plays)

06:00.127 --> 06:02.696
Doublemeat
is double sweet. Enjoy.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.031
Thank you.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.266
Just somethin' I'm tryin'.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.538
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Oh, time has no meaning here.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.273
Gina, I'm taking a break.

06:20.613 --> 06:24.250
I have this sudden urge
to dedicate
my productive cooperation.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.519
Well, if you
close your eyes...

06:26.553 --> 06:30.023
and repeatedly smash yourself
in the head with frozen meat,
it'll go away.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.292
Eventually.

06:32.324 --> 06:36.129
I'm hoping.
Thanks for coming by.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.899
Is it bad?

06:39.932 --> 06:42.069
I was sort of hoping
you could tell me.

06:42.101 --> 06:45.137
I knew this was gonna happen.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.908
What did Willow do now?
Did she-- she hurt anyone?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.978
What? Uh, no, no.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.680
Um, Tara, this isn't
about Willow.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.750
I thought that's why
you didn't wanna meet
at the house.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.420
Uh, sorry. It's, um--

07:01.454 --> 07:04.992
Willow's fine. She's been
doing really well.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.961
You'd be proud of her.

07:07.995 --> 07:11.098
Good. That's-- That's good.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.065
So, what do you wanna
talk about?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.901
(Sighs)

07:14.935 --> 07:17.771
It's Spike.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.706
He can hurt me...

07:23.110 --> 07:25.444
without his head exploding.

07:25.478 --> 07:29.348
Oh, my God.
His chip stopped working?
No.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.918
It still works.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.987
Just not on me.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.257
I need to know
about the spell--

07:37.290 --> 07:39.726
the one that
brought me back.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.630
I'd ask Willow, but--

07:43.663 --> 07:46.033
You think it's you.

07:47.199 --> 07:49.069
I don't know.

07:50.704 --> 07:54.206
I feel... different.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.143
There are things that--

07:59.579 --> 08:03.283
I think maybe
I came back wrong.

08:03.315 --> 08:07.153
No, Buffy, that's not-- No!

08:07.187 --> 08:10.189
You didn't.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.360
Can you check out
the spell? Just see
if there's something that--

08:15.062 --> 08:17.730
Could you just check,
please?

08:21.901 --> 08:24.538
JONATHAN:
Right there.
That's got it.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.139
Mad Dog Two to Mad Dog One.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.442
I thought I was Mad Dog Two.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.081
Mad Dog Three
to Mad Dog One.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.383
Signal's coming in
strong and clear. Over.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.418
Roger that.
Beginning preliminary sweep.

08:50.462 --> 08:54.934
Keep your potatoes peeled
for the Slayer.
I don't want any surprises.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.236
We can really have
anyone we want.

08:57.269 --> 09:01.207
-It's like candy.
-Juicy, pulsating candy.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.943
Oh! The one with the neck.
Put the whammy on the neck!

09:03.976 --> 09:06.513
No. The redhead.
I want the redhead.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.448
JONATHAN:
The redhead's too tall.
So get a stepladder.

09:09.481 --> 09:12.184
ANDREW: Get off of me, jerk!
JONATHAN: Take it back!

09:12.219 --> 09:15.554
-Target acquired.
-What?

09:15.589 --> 09:18.390
-Initiating contact.
-JONATHAN:
The brunette?

09:18.424 --> 09:21.761
She's kinda cute. Ow!
Oh, no.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.931
Go for the leather skirt.
Oh, bazoombas!

09:23.963 --> 09:26.899
-JONATHAN: Go for the one
with the bazoombas.
-Go for the bazoombas.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.036
-(Both Chanting)
Bazoombas! Bazoombas!
-(Loud Feedback)

09:29.068 --> 09:30.671
(Both Screaming)

09:32.572 --> 09:36.076
So how did you get
so beautiful?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.510
Okay, does that line
usually work?

09:40.179 --> 09:42.282
What the hell
are you doing here?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.417
It's nice to see you
again too, Katrina.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.886
It's the seeing
you part that's
throwing me here, Warren,

09:46.919 --> 09:50.557
because I thought I was pretty
clear with the never wanting
that to happen again.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.760
Never's a long time, baby.
Apparently,
not long enough.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.629
Oh, you're not still
sore about that thing,
are you?

09:56.663 --> 09:59.732
What thing would that be,
exactly?

09:59.767 --> 10:02.802
What, the wind-up slut
you tinkered together,

10:02.836 --> 10:05.773
or when little
Miss Nuts and Bolts tried
to choke me to death?

10:05.806 --> 10:09.241
Okay, so I've made
a few mistakes.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.745
No. No, I did...

10:11.778 --> 10:15.115
for ever lowering myself
to be with a jerk like you.

10:15.148 --> 10:19.919
No, don't say that.
Well, what did you expect,
to just waltz in here...

10:19.952 --> 10:22.990
and sweep me off my feet
with your cheesy lines
and fancy suit?

10:23.023 --> 10:25.692
No, I-- I just...
thought we could talk.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.028
I thought maybe
we could work things out.

10:28.061 --> 10:32.365
There is nothing
to work out.
What you did was sick.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.868
And just looking at you
makes me wanna vomit.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.205
-Are you sure about that?
-Yes. God, yes, I'm sure.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.812
I love you, master.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.048
I love you too, baby.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.318
(Sighs)
I'm home.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.788
Who wants to help scrape
the grease off my--

10:54.822 --> 10:56.889
(Waltz playing)
Is there singing?

10:56.923 --> 10:59.625
Are we singing again?
Nope.
Just the dancing.

10:59.658 --> 11:03.831
We're teaching Dawn perfectly
synchronized dance steps
for the wedding reception.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.133
Wanna go for a spin?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.634
I think I'm heading
more towards
an ungainly collapse.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.404
Oh. Rough day?
Kinda.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.542
You've been going at it
too hard, Buffy.
We hardly ever see you.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.345
What with slingin'
the Doublemeat
and poundin' the big evil.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.380
You are looking
a little pounded.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.384
Just around the eyes.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.986
We're thinking of heading
to The Bronze later.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.188
Wanna come,
get all unwindy?

11:29.221 --> 11:33.225
Tall glasses
of frosty relaxation on me.
Nectar of the working man.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.163
No, thanks. I think
I'll stay here with Dawn.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.165
-Curl up on the couch with
a big bowl of popcorn and--
-(Horn Honking)

11:39.198 --> 11:43.036
Listen to the cars honk?
Where are you going?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.238
Um, sleeping over
at Janice's.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.775
And I'm falling
for that again because
of the surprise lobotomy?

11:48.808 --> 11:51.211
It's okay.
I checked it out.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.245
Janice's mom
is picking her up.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.048
Oh.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.184
I didn't think you'd care.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.253
You're never home, so--

12:02.621 --> 12:04.724
I know.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.293
I'm sorry, you know.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.429
But I'm here now,
all visible and everything.

12:10.462 --> 12:13.066
Couldn't you just stay
at Janice's another night?

12:13.100 --> 12:17.570
Her mom's cooking Mexican.
She's gonna teach me
how to make real tortillas.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.809
Not like I knew
you'd be around.
(Horn Honking)

12:29.649 --> 12:31.918
(Door closes)

12:33.086 --> 12:35.989
Frosty nectar, now, please.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.061
Thank you, baby.
My pleasure, master.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.230
That is so cool.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.399
I really could've used
one of these in high school.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.768
Gentlemen, to crime.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.669
(Both)
Crime.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.142
(Coughs)
Crime tastes funny.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.844
Wow!

12:58.946 --> 13:01.815
I still think
I would've gone
with the bazoombas, but--

13:04.683 --> 13:06.485
Wow!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.687
Yeah.
She's really cute.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.389
Cute?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.294
Look at her, man.

13:16.528 --> 13:19.499
The shape of her lips.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.533
Smooth, silky skin.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.436
The way her--
(Chuckles)

13:23.470 --> 13:25.672
The way her nose crinkles
when she laughs.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.774
She's perfect.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.945
(Both Laughing)

13:31.979 --> 13:33.980
Yeah.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.448
She's totally hot.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.452
-So are you, master.
-You think so?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.222
Oh, yes, master.

13:43.255 --> 13:47.527
Okay, so, how do we--

13:47.559 --> 13:49.562
You know?
Who gets to?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.730
I do.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.799
That's not fair.
Dude, you didn't call it.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.336
Oh, I don't have
to call it, Sparky.
She's mine.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.873
But don't worry. You can
play with her all you want...

14:01.107 --> 14:03.009
after I'm done with her.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.384
(Door Opens, Closes)
(Coughs)

14:19.359 --> 14:22.394
I missed you so much.
You never should've
left me.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.700
Say it.
I never should've
left you, master.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.874
Tell me you love me.
I love you, master.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.879
Again.
I love you, master.

14:42.881 --> 14:46.119
I love you too, baby.
Get on your knees.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.087
Yes, Warren.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.459
Wait.
What'd you just say?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.594
I said, "Yes, War-- "

14:58.630 --> 15:00.600
(Gasps)
What the--

15:00.633 --> 15:03.135
What did you do to me?

15:03.169 --> 15:05.138
WARREN:
Get the dampener!

15:05.172 --> 15:08.274
-Who the hell are you?
-Um, your masters?

15:08.307 --> 15:10.110
-My what?
-Where'd you put it?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.711
Are you kidding me?
Get the dampener.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.081
You were gonna share me
with these two dorks?

15:15.115 --> 15:18.051
Hey, we're super villains.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.851
Call us master.
Wait!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.058
Aw, crap.
It's outta juice.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.561
Is that what
you used on me?

15:28.595 --> 15:32.264
Oh, my God.
First a skankbot, and now this?

15:32.298 --> 15:35.402
What is wrong with you?
I wanted us to be together.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.138
There is no us, Warren.
Get that through
your big, meaty head.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.506
I am not
your girlfriend anymore.

15:40.539 --> 15:43.342
-She's your ex?
-Dude, that is messed up.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.479
Oh, you think,
you bunch of little boys,
playing at being men?

15:46.513 --> 15:51.584
Well, this is not some fantasy!
It's not a game, you freaks!
It's rape.

15:51.618 --> 15:55.322
-What?
-No, we didn't--

15:55.355 --> 15:58.524
You're all sick,
and I'm gonna make sure
you get locked up for this.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.994
And then we'll see
how you like getting raped.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.197
Stop her.
Get off me!

16:22.081 --> 16:23.982
Charge
the cerebral dampener.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.956
Warren--
Charge the dampener.
Andrew,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.892
get her up.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.796
We'll give her another dose.

16:36.828 --> 16:40.067
A strong one.
Everything's all right.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.900
Everything is gonna
be all right.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.238
I don't think so.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.277
She's dead.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.556
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.525
Her neck. It-- It just--

17:05.557 --> 17:08.627
No. That's not--

17:11.131 --> 17:13.566
This isn't happening.
I just-- I gotta--

17:13.598 --> 17:16.403
Let me think.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.239
What'd you do?
Oh, God.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.740
What the hell did you do?

17:21.772 --> 17:26.246
We did this.
Me and Andrew and you.
It's on all of us!

17:26.278 --> 17:28.815
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-Shut up!

17:32.118 --> 17:34.787
We have to get--
We have to
get rid of it.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.257
JONATHAN:
How?

17:37.289 --> 17:40.058
Maybe a spell.
Can you teleport it
out of here?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.663
No. She's--

17:45.832 --> 17:49.435
It's too big.
Andrew.

17:49.469 --> 17:53.740
Andrew!
What?

17:53.772 --> 17:56.776
Is there anything
that you can summon?

17:56.808 --> 17:59.412
Something that--

17:59.445 --> 18:02.281
Something that can
devour that much?

18:04.416 --> 18:08.221
Maybe a Jarvlen flesh-eater,
but they're hard to control.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.690
It'd go for us too.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.929
Oh, well, that's it, man.
We're screwed.
We just have to stay calm.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.065
Tell that to your girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend.

18:19.097 --> 18:22.402
It doesn't matter!
There's a link.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.938
You knew her, so there's a link.
You don't think Buffy will
be able to put that together?

18:25.971 --> 18:28.641
That's what she does.
She'll figure it out!

18:28.674 --> 18:31.443
It was an accident.
Maybe we could
turn ourselves in.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.945
No.
He's right. If we go
to the police now--

18:33.980 --> 18:36.915
-No. I am not going to jail.
-We can't hide this!

18:36.949 --> 18:40.019
Sooner or later, the Slayer's
gonna find out she's dead.

18:40.051 --> 18:43.190
Well, then, maybe
it should be sooner.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.595
Are you insane? No!
Listen to me. Listen!

18:48.627 --> 18:52.699
We have two problems--
the body and the Slayer.

18:52.731 --> 18:56.035
What if there was a way
that we could take
care of them both...

18:56.067 --> 18:58.003
with one big stone?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.510
WILLOW:
What are they doing?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.878
(Swing music playing)

19:10.016 --> 19:13.819
We're not gonna
have to do that
at the wedding, are we?

19:13.853 --> 19:17.022
'Cause there's this last thread
of dignity I've been
desperately clinging to.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.726
You're still
doing okay, right?

19:19.759 --> 19:22.828
Yeah. You know,
some days are harder...

19:22.862 --> 19:25.131
than the really hard days.

19:25.163 --> 19:29.201
It's easier like this, though,
when I'm not alone.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.503
I'm sorry I haven't
been around that much.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.840
Oh, no. That's not--
It's okay. We know
you've been all tied up.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.742
What?

19:36.776 --> 19:40.011
With your job
and the slaying.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.249
Hey, I see sitting
where there should
be dancing.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.317
Come share in the joy
of our groove thang.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.519
And despite that,
I succumb to the beat.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.056
I think I'll catch
the next soul train out.

19:50.088 --> 19:53.192
You sure?
Oh, yeah. You know.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.528
Glass all the way empty.
More nectar required.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.598
Cool. Well, shimmy on out
when you're done lubricatin'.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.994

20:48.347 --> 20:51.317
SPIKE:
You see,

20:51.351 --> 20:53.353
you try to
be with them,

20:54.953 --> 20:57.189
but you always end
up in the dark...

20:59.291 --> 21:01.259
with me.

21:06.164 --> 21:09.402
What would they think of you
if they found out...

21:09.435 --> 21:12.038
all the things
you've done?

21:16.107 --> 21:18.510
If they knew...

21:18.545 --> 21:20.880
who you really were?

21:26.184 --> 21:28.019
Don't.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.557
Stop me.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.002
(Moans Softly)

21:50.643 --> 21:53.179
No. Don't close your eyes.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.016
Look at them.

21:57.048 --> 21:59.018
That's not your world.

22:00.251 --> 22:02.221
You belong
in the shadows...

22:04.022 --> 22:05.924
with me.

22:08.059 --> 22:10.863
Look at your friends
and tell me...

22:10.896 --> 22:15.201
you don't love
getting away with this...

22:15.233 --> 22:17.503
right under their noses.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.713
Ugh. I think I pulled
a jive muscle last night.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.949
The funky monkey
claims another victim.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.153
Tara.
What are you doin' here?

22:34.185 --> 22:38.023
I mean, uh,
it's okay for you
to be here...

22:38.057 --> 22:40.992
if you have things
that you have to
be here for.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.063
I'm gonna go bring
Anya up to speed...

22:44.096 --> 22:45.865
on that monkey situation.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.572
There's a monkey problem?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.874
Only if you don't
stretch first.

22:56.442 --> 22:59.077
The Brekenkrieg Grimoire?

22:59.111 --> 23:01.180
Light reading?

23:01.212 --> 23:05.617
Yeah. I was just--
No, it's okay.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.720
I didn't expect you...

23:07.753 --> 23:10.757
to stop doing magic
just because--

23:10.789 --> 23:12.759
You don't have
to hide it.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.462
I'm not--
I'm doing better.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.397
No spells for 32 days.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.801
I can even go to
the Magic Shop now,

23:22.835 --> 23:26.638
as long as someone's
with me at all times.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.541
But, uh--
But it's better now.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.611
It really is.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.579
You know, if you were
checking on me.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.515
No. I wouldn't--

23:36.749 --> 23:38.951
I was just looking for Buffy.

23:38.984 --> 23:42.822
Oh. Well, I haven't
seen her since last night.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.824
She's not around
much these days.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.160
We kinda miss her.

23:48.193 --> 23:51.329
I'm sure she feels
the same way.

23:51.363 --> 23:55.634
If you see her, can you tell her
that I need to talk to her?
It's important.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.671
Yeah.
Of course I will.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.707
Thanks.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.544
Wil?

24:05.944 --> 24:09.848

you're doing better.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.723

 of the choices *

25:30.362 --> 25:32.463
* That we make

25:33.766 --> 25:37.936
* And the barriers

25:41.941 --> 25:43.742
* That's so retrograde *

Don't think about the evil
bloodsucking fiend.

but the evil
bloodsucking fiend.

Spike, what's happening?

26:45.136 --> 26:47.973
So, you thought you could
just slip away then?

26:48.007 --> 26:50.041
Vampire, remember?

26:51.677 --> 26:54.012
I could feel you.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.520

Do you mind?

Buffy.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.951
She's dead.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.953
I killed her.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.038
We have to go.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.240
What happened?

28:29.275 --> 28:32.111
There's nothing
you can do now.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.046
We have to go before
someone sees you.

We have to go now.

28:43.789 --> 28:48.094
All right.
Listen to me, Buffy. Buffy!
She's dead.

28:48.126 --> 28:51.596
It was an accident.
I killed her.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.099
I'm gonna get you home.
No.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.567
I'm gonna get you home,
and you're gonna crawl
in your warm, comfy bed...

28:56.602 --> 28:59.238
and stay there.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.851
Is she all right?

32:32.884 --> 32:35.221
No.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.790
I'm sorry.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.134
There's something
I have to do.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.337
I have to tell
what I did.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.842
I have to go to the police.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.743
The police?

33:00.078 --> 33:02.614
Dawnie, I have to.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.152
But...

33:06.184 --> 33:08.253
what's going to happen?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.356
I don't know.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.362
They'll take you away,
won't they?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.799
I'm sorry.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.803
No, you're not.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.506
You're never here.

33:27.538 --> 33:30.008
You can't even stand
to be around me.

33:30.041 --> 33:33.144
That is not true.
You don't wanna
be here with me.

33:33.179 --> 33:36.013
You didn't
wanna come back.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.217
I know that.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.853
You were happier
where you were.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.990
You wanna
go away again.

33:45.022 --> 33:47.058
Dawn.
Then go.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.895
You're not really
here anyway.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.867
(Siren Wails)

34:05.211 --> 34:07.546
SPIKE:
What do you think
you're doing?

34:07.578 --> 34:09.815
The right thing for once.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.623
Sorry, love.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.891
Can't let you do that.

34:20.925 --> 34:23.161
I have to tell them
what happened.
Nothing happened.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.264
I killed that girl.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.034
Demons in the woods?
Time going wonky?

34:29.067 --> 34:31.402
They won't believe you.
I'll show them.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.838
Show them what?

34:35.940 --> 34:37.909
What did you do?

34:37.943 --> 34:40.710
I took care of it.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.081
What did you do?

34:43.114 --> 34:46.117
What I had to.
I went back
and I took care of it.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.487
It doesn't matter now.
No one will ever find her.

34:48.518 --> 34:51.422
POLICEMAN:
Where'd they find her?

34:51.456 --> 34:54.925
The river. She washed up
half a mile from the cemetery.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.862
Oh, balls.

35:05.936 --> 35:08.306
There still isn't anything
to connect this to you.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.076
-It doesn't matter.
-It wasn't your fault.

35:11.108 --> 35:14.746
-I killed her.
-It was an accident.
It just happened.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.815
Nothing just happens.

35:16.847 --> 35:19.351
You are not going in there.

35:19.385 --> 35:23.355
I have to do this.
Just let me go.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.056
I can't. I love you.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.195
No, you don't.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.731
You think
I haven't tried not to?

35:37.135 --> 35:39.371
Try harder.

35:46.143 --> 35:49.181
You are not throwing
your life away over this.

35:49.215 --> 35:53.050
-It's not your choice.
-Why are you doing
this to yourself?

35:53.083 --> 35:56.054
A girl is dead because of me.

35:56.086 --> 35:59.324
And how many people are
alive because of you?
How many have you saved?

35:59.358 --> 36:01.960
One dead girl
doesn't tip the scale.

36:01.992 --> 36:05.530
That's all it is to you,
isn't it? Just another body.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.065
Buffy.

36:09.434 --> 36:12.070
You can't understand why
this is killing me, can you?

36:12.103 --> 36:13.905
Why don't you explain it?

36:15.773 --> 36:19.077
That's it. Put it on me.
Put it all on me.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.248
-That's my girl.
-I am not your girl!

36:26.016 --> 36:28.920
You don't have a soul!

36:28.954 --> 36:32.657
There is nothing good
or clean in you!

36:32.690 --> 36:34.726
You are dead inside!

36:34.760 --> 36:38.230
You can't feel anything real.

36:38.264 --> 36:41.432
I could never be your girl!

36:56.648 --> 37:00.217
You always hurt
the one you love, pet.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.487
(Whimpers)

37:04.489 --> 37:06.625
Buffy?

37:13.664 --> 37:15.567
Buffy.

37:25.943 --> 37:28.414
(Phones Ringing)

37:28.447 --> 37:32.751
No. No statements,
not until
I get confirmation.

37:32.784 --> 37:36.322
Excuse me. I need--
I'll be with you in a sec.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.423
Sunnydale P.D.

37:38.456 --> 37:40.891
Yeah. The phone's
ringing off the hook here.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.461
Listen, you got an I.D.
on that body yet?

37:43.494 --> 37:46.431
Yeah?
Okay, shoot.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.967
Katrina Silber.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.170
S-I-L-B-E-R.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.773
KATRINA:
Just tell her to go away.
WARREN: I can't.

37:55.806 --> 37:58.577
You're keeping secrets
from me-- other girls
and who knows what else?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.780
Trina, shut up.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.949
Warren.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.385
Thanks. Now, what's
the problem, miss?

38:10.356 --> 38:14.592
-ANYA:
Is this what you saw?
-Yeah, that's it.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.827
The Rwasundi. Very rare.

38:16.862 --> 38:21.166
Its presence
in our dimension
causes a sort of...

38:21.199 --> 38:23.702
localized temporal
disturbance.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.605
So, that's why time
went all David Lynch?
Right.

38:26.637 --> 38:30.141
Human perception is based
on a linear chronology.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.277
Being exposed to the Rwasundi
for more than a few seconds...

38:33.311 --> 38:38.148
can cause
vivid hallucinations
and a slight tingly scalp.

38:38.182 --> 38:41.219
So, that's it. These things
just made you think
you killed her.

38:41.251 --> 38:44.590
She was probably dead long
before you stumbled across her.

38:45.891 --> 38:49.126
It wasn't the demon.
It was Warren.

38:49.159 --> 38:52.197
He knew Katrina.
He had something
to do with it. I know it.

38:52.230 --> 38:56.402
-How can you be sure?
-You always hurt
the one you love.

38:58.536 --> 39:00.237
Does this mean
you're not going away?

39:02.239 --> 39:05.543
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.585
We need to find Warren
and the others.

39:14.619 --> 39:17.255
Whatever they've done,
they're not gonna
get away with it.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.925
We're gonna get away with it.
"Injuries consistent
with a fall."

39:19.958 --> 39:21.960
The coroner's
ruling it a suicide.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.597
What about Buffy?

39:25.630 --> 39:28.333
It wasn't that hard
messing her game up.
If she figures it out,

39:28.365 --> 39:30.300
we'll take care of her.

39:32.237 --> 39:35.072
We really got away
with murder.

39:35.106 --> 39:39.376
That's... kinda cool.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.882
Yeah.

39:46.418 --> 39:49.588
Cool.
BUFFY:
Are you sure?

39:49.621 --> 39:53.925
I've double-checked everything.
There's nothing wrong with you.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.762
Then why can Spike hurt me?

39:56.795 --> 39:59.230
Well, I said that
there was nothing
wrong with you,

39:59.264 --> 40:01.699
but you are different.

40:01.733 --> 40:06.204
Shifting you out of--
from where you were--

40:06.237 --> 40:09.608
funneling your essence
back into your body,

40:09.641 --> 40:12.643
it altered you on
a basic, molecular level,

40:12.677 --> 40:17.882
probably just enough to confuse
the sensors or whatever
in Spike's chip,

40:17.916 --> 40:20.452
but it's all just surfacey,
physical stuff.

40:20.485 --> 40:24.755
It wouldn't have
any more effect
than a bad sunburn.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.496
I didn't come back wrong?

40:30.528 --> 40:32.797
No. You're
the same Buffy--

40:32.831 --> 40:35.900
with a deep,
tropical cellular tan.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.771
You must've missed something.
Will you check again?

40:39.804 --> 40:43.108
Buffy, I promise.
There's nothing
wrong with you.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.143
There has to be.

40:46.512 --> 40:49.514
This just can't be me.
It isn't me.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.652
Why do I feel like this?

40:53.684 --> 40:56.153
Why do I let Spike
do those things to me?

40:57.489 --> 41:00.025
You mean hit you?

41:04.563 --> 41:06.396
Oh.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.570
Oh... really.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.474
He's everything I hate.

41:17.509 --> 41:21.579
He's everything that
I'm supposed to be against,

41:23.248 --> 41:26.416
but the only time that
I ever feel anything is when--

41:30.021 --> 41:34.391
-Don't tell anyone, please.
-I won't.

41:34.425 --> 41:37.161
Oh, the way
they would look at me.
I just couldn't--

41:37.195 --> 41:39.164
I won't tell anyone.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.431
I wouldn't do that.

41:44.034 --> 41:46.371
Why can't I stop?

41:46.403 --> 41:48.706
Why do I keep letting him in?

41:51.242 --> 41:53.043
Do you love him?

41:54.512 --> 41:57.382
It's okay if you do.
He's done a lot of good,

41:57.414 --> 42:00.251
and he does love you.

42:00.284 --> 42:04.422
And, Buffy,
it's okay if you don't.

42:04.454 --> 42:08.492
You're going through
a really hard time,
and you're--

42:08.525 --> 42:12.030
What? Using him?

42:12.063 --> 42:14.231
What's okay about that?

42:14.264 --> 42:16.201
It's not that simple.

42:16.233 --> 42:19.269
It is. It's wrong.

42:19.304 --> 42:23.440
I'm wrong. Tell me
that I'm wrong, please.

42:23.474 --> 42:28.179
Please don't forgive me.
Please!

42:28.213 --> 42:30.782
God, please don't.
(Sobbing)

42:32.050 --> 42:34.786
Please don't forgive me!

42:39.757 --> 42:41.960
Please don't!

42:51.568 --> 42:54.472
(theme music plays)

43:16.827 --> 43:18.697
Grr! Arrgh!
