WEBVTT

00:21.730 --> 00:24.232
- Ooh!
- Oh, oh, gosh, gosh.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.859
I've got it.
It's all right.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.861
What a mess.

00:27.944 --> 00:31.531
Oh, it's a day of all this.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.284
It's scrambled
this morning, darling.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.036
It's just
the advance team today.

00:36.119 --> 00:40.040
We have plenty of time
to prepare.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.708
Nervous?

00:41.791 --> 00:43.251
Well, with you by my side,

00:43.335 --> 00:46.921
I know I can't screw this up
too badly.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.131
Thank you for being here.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.467
I imagine Blanche
isn't too pleased.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.345
As pleased as Blanche
gets about anything.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.055
I'm your editor,

00:55.138 --> 00:58.058
and "Life" magazine
interviewing you

00:58.141 --> 00:59.851
is as big as it gets--

00:59.934 --> 01:03.188
four million copies per week!

01:03.271 --> 01:05.272
I'm supposed to be here.

01:05.357 --> 01:08.902
It's my job, and besides that,
I-I want to support you.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.321
Well, I appreciate it, but...

01:11.404 --> 01:15.283
that numerical detail
has made me even more nervous.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.576
Four million copies?

01:16.658 --> 01:19.079
A great place to
mention "Mastering" part two.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.331
Here you are.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.750
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Paul.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.919
Well, uh...

01:26.002 --> 01:30.256
you look exquisite today.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.844
And you are exhausting.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.142
- Fuck, they're early.
- Oof.

01:50.985 --> 01:51.945
Cha--

01:54.239 --> 01:56.032
What are you doing here?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.741
Captain...

01:57.826 --> 02:00.161
you look spiffy.

02:03.164 --> 02:07.127
Hello, Ju-u-lia.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.128
Charles...

02:09.211 --> 02:10.880
To what do we owe the pleasure?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.132
Well, I was in the area,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.301
and I thought I'd drop in
on my baby brother.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.722
Still counting
those 90 seconds?

02:18.805 --> 02:21.725
You do know it's polite
to call first, Charles.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.019
We have quite a bit going on
in the house right now.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.146
Are you planning on staying?

02:26.228 --> 02:28.231
Uh, Charlie Child,
and you are?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.983
Judith Jones.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.403
Allies in alliteration.

02:33.486 --> 02:37.198
Judith is a dear friend,
brilliant editor,

02:37.281 --> 02:39.117
and current houseguest.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.286
Oh. Mm.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.164
- It's so good to see you.
- Been too long.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.208
- Do I smell coffee?
- Uh, uh, the finest.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.585
I thought I'd surprise you.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.670
See, my wife needed
a break from me.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.506
- Again?
- Oh, I can't imagine why.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.597
Little help with the coffee,
please, Paul!

03:00.680 --> 03:04.184
Cream and sugar, Ju-u-lia!

03:04.267 --> 03:07.020
He can't stay with us.
It's not possible.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.565
With "Life" magazine and Judith
here and filming the show...

03:10.648 --> 03:14.402
The timing is terrible,
I know, but it's family.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.071
After all, he's my big brother.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.907
Oh, for God's sakes,
you're the same age.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.828
She can't even do
a little interview

03:23.912 --> 03:25.163
without you, huh?

03:25.246 --> 03:28.041
"Little interview"?
It's "Life" magazine.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.501
Everyone reads it.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.962
Ooh, not I.
It's a bit plebeian.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.344
Oh, this house...

03:39.427 --> 03:43.055
It seems smaller
than I remembered it.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.850
Shall we bunk together?

03:45.934 --> 03:48.978
I've decided I'm going
to check myself into a hotel.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.357
"A hotel"?
No, I won't hear of it.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.650
Oh, no, you must stay.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.194
You're here to keep me
from bungling this whole thing.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.114
I'll be here every day
and at GBH for rehearsals.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.240
I promise.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.117
There'll be no bungling
on my watch.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.202
- But the cost is--
- Julia is right.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.246
Don't leave on my account.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.289
Not on your account,
on Knopf's account.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.041
I want to, really.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.294
I suppose it's settled, then.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.963
Oh, it's settled.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.841
Where are they?

04:18.925 --> 04:21.052
I have a meeting with Hunter
about Season 2

04:21.136 --> 04:22.595
that I need to get to.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.763
Go.

04:23.847 --> 04:28.476
Paul and I will man the fort,
get "Life" magazine set up.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.271
I have plenty to read
while we wait for them.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.274
Can you expense the room
for Charlie instead?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.752
And voilà.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.547
Oh, sunshine,
that looks perfect.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.008
You look perfect.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.302
- Mm.
- Mm.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.561
I'm starving.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.313
Me too.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.564
This morning was...

05:14.647 --> 05:16.941
Spectacular.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.027
We really earned this.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.403
Mm-hmm.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.038
- Good morning, Benny.
- Morning, Julia.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.757
Excuse me.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.966
What is that?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.719
This is
the GE TCF Spacemaker 2000.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.972
Ah!
You beat me to the good news.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.519
Product placement.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.815
Companies will pay to see
their merchandise on TV.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.692
You mean
on "The French Chef"?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.402
Of course
on "The French Chef."

06:00.485 --> 06:02.028
No one's watching
anything else.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.031
We can fund all our new
programming this way.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.576
GE has already covered
Alice's pilot.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.995
But I've never even
used these before.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.415
Well, they're cutting edge.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.419
Oh, Hunter,
I'm not sure about this.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.755
I'm not a salesman.
I'm a teacher.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.008
But that's all
you have to do.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.801
- What?
- Teach.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.554
Do exactly what
you've been doing.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.847
Nothing will change.

06:28.930 --> 06:33.560
Just use those,
also these and...

06:33.643 --> 06:35.812
this.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.940
You know, uh, you won't even
notice a difference.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.233
I promise.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.818
Don't worry about it.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
Oh, Alice.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.989
- Oh, those are lovely.
- Thank you, Julia.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.323
Hunter, sorry to interrupt.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.616
They are waiting for you

06:48.700 --> 06:50.409
at the
"By Women, For Women" taping.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.911
Oh, right.
Uh, coming, coming.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.039
Yes, break a leg.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.042
After Russell's show,
this has to work.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.835
It's going to.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.059
- Right. There she is.
- Oh, okay.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.187
- Who?
- Kathleen, our host.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.813
It's progressive...

07:20.357 --> 07:22.275
Okay...

07:22.359 --> 07:24.444
just a little final touch.
Okay.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.281
- Hey.
- Wow.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.949
Look at this.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.409
Okay, people, it's go time.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.457
Um, hi, everyone.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.087
I just wanted to say thank you

07:42.170 --> 07:43.797
for all of your hard work.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.840
Thank you to our host,
Ms. Gordon,

07:45.924 --> 07:50.053
and to our panelists
for believing in this.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.724
There are so many conversations
that happen between women

07:54.808 --> 07:57.352
in this country secretly--

07:57.435 --> 08:01.981
in office hallways,
in women's bathrooms,

08:02.065 --> 08:05.610
whispered behind closed doors.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.364
We are going to bring these
discussions to the forefront

08:09.447 --> 08:12.492
to help us all
feel less alone out there,

08:12.575 --> 08:14.411
or at least that's my hope--

08:14.494 --> 08:17.080
that it will bring us
all together.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.707
It is something
that I learned was possible

08:19.791 --> 08:21.334
from watching Julia Child.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.005
Television is a bridge...

08:25.088 --> 08:28.049
Especially
if you can make it joyful.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.177
Anyway, I am just--

08:31.261 --> 08:33.138
I am just so thrilled
that we are all here,

08:33.221 --> 08:36.725
and I will stop talking now.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.059
So break a leg everybody.

08:43.815 --> 08:48.236
Okay, and 3, 2...

08:49.612 --> 08:50.947
I am a married woman,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.868
and I was denied contraception
by my doctor.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.037
I'm a married woman
with four children,

08:57.120 --> 09:00.290
and I believe I have a right to
choose whether I have another.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.628
Can state law
prohibit married women

09:05.712 --> 09:07.339
from using contraception?

09:07.422 --> 09:09.549
That's the question facing
the Supreme Court

09:09.632 --> 09:11.634
in Griswold vs. Connecticut.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.553
We'll take a close look
at that today

09:13.636 --> 09:16.306
when we discuss
birth control in America.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.101
It's a tough pill to swallow.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.354
But we're going to have
a good time here today.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.772
I promise.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.899
I'm your host,
Kathleen Gordon,

09:25.982 --> 09:28.735
and this is
"By Women, For Women."

09:37.077 --> 09:40.663
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why are you moving that? I--

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
Come on.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.042
I-I don't think this
so-called art director

09:44.125 --> 09:45.418
has any understanding--

09:45.502 --> 09:48.088
Hunter wants to do something
called product placement

09:48.171 --> 09:50.006
on "The French Chef."

09:50.090 --> 09:53.301
Companies will pay to have me
hawk their wares on the show.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.553
Hmm.
That's an interesting idea.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.973
They have changed
"The French Chef" set.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.936
A new icebox--
the GE Space-whatever 3000.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.522
Well, now, is a new fridge
so terrible?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.815
Really, Paul?

10:06.898 --> 10:09.234
Are you enjoying having
your artwork rearranged?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.443
No, no, I--

10:10.527 --> 10:12.195
Where is she going with that?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.802
Steak au poivre.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.097
It was Freddie who taught me
how to make the sauce.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.474
Oh, shouldn't bring him up.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.309
Oh, God!

10:43.393 --> 10:47.313
Oh, darling,
it's wonderful. Mmm.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.442
Might have taken it off
a bit earlier, though.

10:50.525 --> 10:53.862
Mm, Charlie Bones approved
the blueprints for France.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.488
I had some thoughts.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.783
You can critique it
once it's finished.

10:58.867 --> 10:59.826
Come visit us.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.995
Oh, the French--
not my people.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.789
Always there
when they need you.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.666
The house will be quaint,
though,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.710
once you fix
those design issues.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.670
Charlie is
a talented architect.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.630
Amateur architect.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.091
Mm, I designed and built
my vacation home in Maine.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.427
- Mm.
- I wrote a book about it.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.638
It's very beautiful--
the book, too.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.223
Charlie did all
the illustrations.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.767
Captain, you're
making me blush.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.101
Okay. I got to ask--

11:25.185 --> 11:26.853
why do you keep
calling Paul "Captain"?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.521
Oh...

11:28.605 --> 11:30.357
funny story.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.318
- When we were five, six...
- Seven.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.112
I blinded Paul
in the left eye with a needle.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.531
Hilarious story, isn't it?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.408
- Permanently?
- It was an accident.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.077
Of course it was,

11:42.160 --> 11:44.537
but Paul had to wear
an eye patch for months.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.414
He looked like a little pirate.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.042
We were obsessed
with "Treasure Island" as boys.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.587
So I called him
Captain One Eye.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.714
- Charlie was Charlie Bones.
- Aye.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.509
Yes, and then eventually
he just became Captain.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.844
You know, it actually
made me feel better,

11:59.928 --> 12:01.513
turning it into a game.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.390
I had no idea, Paul.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.684
You're such
a gifted visual artist,

12:05.767 --> 12:08.144
painter, photographer.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.147
That's remarkable.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.732
Yes, he is a marvel.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.151
Would you pass
the pepper, please?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.153
Doesn't let anything
get in his way.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.449
He was scared of heights, and
he decided to conquer his fear

12:21.533 --> 12:23.868
by repairing stained glass

12:23.952 --> 12:26.746
in the upper reaches
of great cathedrals.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.582
They dubbed him
Tarzan of the Apse.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.834
Oh.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.796
Julia, tell me, why is it
you and Paul left Europe?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.925
Why are you asking?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.176
It must have been jarring

12:40.260 --> 12:44.139
going from such an exciting
life to settling in Cambridge.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.599
Why would you do that?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.102
Where's this coming from?

12:49.185 --> 12:53.064
Those are some questions
you should have answers to.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.784
The interview questions?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.494
Well, how did you get them?

13:06.578 --> 13:08.621
I chatted up
the art director.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.415
She had very good taste.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.001
Managed to grab them
while she wasn't looking.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.296
Does he want it raw?

13:16.379 --> 13:19.007
It was steak au poivre,
not steak tartare.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.051
I took it off
at the decisive moment.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.969
I don't know why you
let him get to you, Julie.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.138
Thinks the sun
shines out of his ass.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.891
Well, that's not his fault.
Mother thought that, too.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.684
He's always been the favorite.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.645
Oh, sure, blame the mother.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.565
- And he stole the questions.
- It's useful having them.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.442
Well, he could have
given them earlier.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.527
And the questions themselves,
they're intrusive.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.904
Don't you think?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.614
It's nobody's business
why we left Europe,

13:42.697 --> 13:44.657
and we can't just
tell the truth now, can we?

13:44.741 --> 13:46.284
Not the whole bald truth.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.454
People could use it
against us and twist it.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.122
My, that's dark.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.833
Is it really is
serious as all that?

13:53.917 --> 13:58.171
Well, no, I only mean if we
don't figure out our story,

13:58.254 --> 13:59.714
they'll tell it for us.

13:59.798 --> 14:03.093
Right.
And we can't whisk it.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.844
No, Paul.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.846
- No.
- All right.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.433
All right,
let's figure this out.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.354
How do we want
to approach "Life"?

14:16.606 --> 14:19.984
What if I killed Charlie
during the interview?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.821
You'd sell
a lot of magazines.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.365
Thank you for watching
"By Women, For Women."

14:25.448 --> 14:27.409
Let's keep
the conversation going.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.910
Till next time.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.124
Ooh.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.126
It's very good. Isn't it?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.670
Yes, very, very good.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.296
She did it.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.133
I-I-I mean, this could
really be something.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.052
- There's nothing else like it.
- It could be big.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.263
Certain parts
were a little explicit--

14:48.346 --> 14:50.306
the diagram, for instance--

14:50.390 --> 14:53.560
but, yes, she did it!

14:53.643 --> 14:56.604
- Whoa, man.
- Hey, grab lunch?

14:56.688 --> 14:59.691
Um, I have to go meet
the sales reps

14:59.774 --> 15:01.109
and then rehearsal.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.819
Don't you have somewhere to be?

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
No.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.073
No meetings, calendar is clear.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.700
- Hmm.
- It's all right.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.744
Marian wants me
to watch Vicki

15:10.827 --> 15:13.371
while she goes to Filene's--
there's a big sale, you know?

15:13.455 --> 15:14.789
I-I should go home.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.332
Okay, then.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.127
Hey.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.796
- So?
- Nice work.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.089
It's fantastic.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.634
You made something
special, truly.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.346
- Russ loved it.
- And Hunter?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.681
Well, we didn't really get
into it, but he seemed happy,

15:31.765 --> 15:34.309
and all of the women
in the office loved it, too.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.269
Elaine, it is good.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.022
No, really, it is good.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.233
We did it.
We fucking did it.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.945
I hope you're cooking up
something salty today.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.324
Well, we're making
a lovely dessert.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.410
There is a pinch.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.496
Salt is always there
for you in a pinch.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.500
Morton's is always
there for you in a pinch.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.627
Say, that's pretty good.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.046
- Can you fit that in there?
- Yes, of course.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.967
Oh, uh, you must be
our man from--

16:08.051 --> 16:10.762
"Life" magazine,
actually, Noel Winton.

16:10.845 --> 16:15.225
Uh, "Life" magazine,
oh, oh, "Life" magazine.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.394
Well, I'll leave
you to it, then.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.270
Let me show you gents
where the magic--

16:19.354 --> 16:21.356
- Julia Child.
- Noel Winton.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.899
I'm only here to observe today,
Mrs. Child,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.192
if that's okay with you.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.986
The interviews start tomorrow,
but I want to watch you work

16:27.070 --> 16:28.279
and see how the sausage
gets made.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.614
It'll be great for the piece.

16:29.698 --> 16:30.949
Certainly.

16:31.032 --> 16:34.828
Although, this episode
is buche de Noel,

16:34.911 --> 16:37.580
and there's no sausage
in this buche.

16:37.664 --> 16:42.502
But how perfect--
buche de Noel with Noel.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.424
Perhaps you'd like
to see the kitchen.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.636
Well, I took your advice.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.721
Oh?

16:52.804 --> 16:56.016
I let him in--Stanley.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.684
And?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.937
And it was very good advice
you gave.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.359
Julia, hello.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.819
When you open the container,

17:08.903 --> 17:12.949
can you please say
that it locks in freshness?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.035
Yes, I'll do my best.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.545
And these, too.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.478
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.104
Judith Jones?

17:43.188 --> 17:45.273
Yes.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.275
Uh, Noel Winton.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.401
Oh, hello.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.031
And you're here to...?

17:53.114 --> 17:56.076
I'm the person
interviewing Julia Child

17:56.159 --> 17:58.078
for "Life" magazine.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.579
- Oh, great.
- That's right.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.081
I work there now.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.918
"The New Yorker" let me go
after I took a year off

18:05.001 --> 18:08.254
to write my novel,
"The Odor of Longing."

18:10.048 --> 18:11.341
You don't remember?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.679
You found it that forgettable.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.973
Well, naturally,
since you turned it down

18:19.057 --> 18:23.228
and, in the process,
gave me a life sentence.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.816
Bad news, ladies.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.567
The Tupperware guy, right?

18:29.651 --> 18:32.320
The reporter
from "Life," Noel--

18:32.404 --> 18:34.572
he's got a bone
to pick with me.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.955
Oh, fuck.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.541
And you want to cut at an angle

18:44.624 --> 18:47.544
to get a more tree-like visual.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.548
Now, my miniature chain saw
makes me feel

18:51.631 --> 18:54.134
like a true lumberjack,

18:54.217 --> 18:57.762
the Paul Bunyan of yule logs.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.774
Uh, how much do you stand
to make from all this?

19:09.858 --> 19:11.735
- Quite a lot, actually.
- Hmm.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.531
May not be the best episode
for that knife, though.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.785
Gosh, that's...

19:22.829 --> 19:26.833
And now it's time
to dress our naked buche

19:26.916 --> 19:29.836
in festive Noel clothing.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.798
Mm-hmm.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.467
Julia, could you do that again,

19:35.550 --> 19:38.678
but, uh, open the fridge
a little slower, please?

19:54.194 --> 19:55.904
All right,
everybody, hold, pause.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.113
Pause, everyone.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.199
Julia, that was great.
We just have a sound issue.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.495
Elaine, a moment.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.832
You are the director.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.626
You have to control
these people.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.336
- I hear you.
- I hear the fridge.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.380
I will fix it.
I promise.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.882
Russ wouldn't let
this happen.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.429
It's all going
to hell in a handbasket.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.848
Calm down. This is
what rehearsals are for.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.142
Yes.
You're right.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.646
I wish I could shrink you
and keep you in my pocket

20:29.729 --> 20:32.565
to deliver advice all day long.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.442
Do you think
you could be there tomorrow

20:34.526 --> 20:35.694
for the interview, please?

20:35.777 --> 20:38.446
Oh, uh, tomorrow, gosh, um--

20:38.530 --> 20:40.699
I need support,
someone to lean on,

20:40.782 --> 20:44.244
and it's always you,
Avis, please.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.288
Um, I have plans
tomorrow with Stanley.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.501
Well, bring him.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.961
Oh.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.465
Okay.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.801
Okay.
We'll be there.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.600
Uh, Julia wanted me to tell
you she'll be right down--

21:07.684 --> 21:09.144
wardrobe issue.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.563
Too busy for the little folk?

21:21.990 --> 21:24.951
Form rejection letter--

21:25.035 --> 21:26.953
you couldn't even name it.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.665
You know, it took months
of my life to write that book,

21:30.749 --> 21:32.709
and then I pulled
every string I had

21:32.792 --> 21:34.169
to get it to Alfred Knopf,

21:34.252 --> 21:36.296
but the manuscript
ended up with you.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.214
What were you, even, then--
an assistant?

21:38.298 --> 21:40.925
I've been senior editor
for years.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.512
The book is about the trials
of masculinity.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.139
It is not a woman's book.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.726
No.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.021
99% of my job is saying no
to men just like you.

21:53.104 --> 21:56.316
If you can't handle it,
that's your problem.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.360
Also...

21:58.443 --> 22:01.154
I haven't seen
"The Odor of Longing"

22:01.237 --> 22:02.322
on any shelves.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.324
I can't have been the only
editor to turn it down.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.409
The rejection
tainted it, obviously.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.083
Have you written anything new?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.626
Lost my confidence.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.294
Rather, it was taken from me.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.837
Oh, come on, Noel.

22:17.921 --> 22:20.215
Who puts "odor"
in a title anyway?

22:20.298 --> 22:23.802
It automatically makes
you think it stinks.

22:23.885 --> 22:24.886
Avis.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.265
Ah, Julia.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.642
Have you seen Avis?

22:30.725 --> 22:32.435
I think she was upstairs
with Stanley.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.770
- Oh.
- Shall we?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.605
Hmm?

22:44.447 --> 22:46.700
I think I'll sit with you
for the interview,

22:46.783 --> 22:49.327
if that's okay, Julia.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.079
Oh, good.

22:52.664 --> 22:55.250
Okay, first question...

22:56.751 --> 22:58.586
You spent half
your life traveling.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.506
The wife of a diplomat,
you worked for the OSS.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.216
Spent the war in Asia,

23:03.299 --> 23:05.135
and then you traded in
all that excitement

23:05.218 --> 23:06.469
for a sleepy college town.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.931
You went from James Bond
to Mr. Chips.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.684
Why?

23:12.767 --> 23:14.894
Life happens, Noel.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.024
You came to television,

23:19.107 --> 23:21.401
something it seems you were
born to do,

23:21.484 --> 23:23.403
rather late in life.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.905
Why?

23:25.989 --> 23:28.908
Well, in the Dark Ages,
when I was born,

23:28.992 --> 23:30.994
TV hadn't been invented yet.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.996
I had no choice but to wait.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.834
Well, don't you wish
you'd started earlier,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.919
when you were a young woman?

23:41.796 --> 23:44.841
Life doesn't come to you...

23:44.924 --> 23:47.635
when you're 6' 2"
and look like me.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.055
I'm sure
I don't have to tell you

23:50.138 --> 23:52.265
that I wasn't an obvious choice
for television

23:52.349 --> 23:56.478
or even culinary school,
for that matter.

23:56.561 --> 23:57.645
No.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.648
I had to find what I love.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.860
But I'm glad
it came to me later.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.279
I wouldn't have been able
to handle all this

24:06.363 --> 24:07.280
when I was young.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.283
I had already learned a lot
about the world

24:10.367 --> 24:13.078
before Simca and I wrote
"Mastering,"

24:13.161 --> 24:15.288
and I needed those lessons
to get me through the book.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.581
But writing is difficult,

24:16.664 --> 24:19.918
which I'm sure I don't have
to tell you, Noel.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.671
But thank goodness our
cookbook landed on the desk

24:22.754 --> 24:25.757
of the brilliant Judith Jones.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.301
Now we're working
on a new book,

24:28.385 --> 24:31.680
Simca, my co-author, and I--

24:31.763 --> 24:36.476
"Mastering the Art
of French Cooking," part 2.

24:46.403 --> 24:49.572
- How did it go?
- It was okay, I think.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.491
Oh, I'm sure
you were incredible.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.785
Now help me.
Hmm?

24:53.868 --> 24:56.287
I want it to read
confident but humble.

24:56.371 --> 24:59.541
Dear, has an ascot
ever read humble?

25:00.959 --> 25:02.460
Maybe a different color.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.462
Yes.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.926
Avis.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.928
Where have you been?

25:12.012 --> 25:15.682
Uh, um...

25:15.765 --> 25:18.143
Your sweater's on inside out.

25:18.226 --> 25:19.728
Thank you for allowing me

25:19.811 --> 25:21.771
into your beautiful home,
Mr. Child.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.648
Please, call me Paul.

25:23.732 --> 25:26.901
I was just admiring
your kitchen.

25:26.985 --> 25:27.902
Hmm.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.696
Julia told me
that you designed the layout?

25:29.779 --> 25:30.613
Mm-hmm.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.407
Can you tell me
a little about that?

25:32.490 --> 25:34.534
Well, uh,
I had to make adjustments

25:34.617 --> 25:36.077
for Julia's height.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.704
She's--she's vertically gifted.

25:37.787 --> 25:42.542
Thank God I had my brilliant
brother, Charlie, to help.

25:42.625 --> 25:46.963
He taught me everything I know
about, well, everything.

25:47.047 --> 25:50.800
See, Charlie is really
the brains of the operation.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.511
Charlie.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.804
Oops.

25:54.888 --> 25:57.057
For heaven's sake.

25:59.976 --> 26:03.063
I apologize for my brother.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.398
He just can't help himself.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.026
Paul Child.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.402
Could you tell me
a little bit

26:09.486 --> 26:10.987
about how you and Julia met?

26:11.071 --> 26:13.782
Well, um,
Julia and I were friends

26:13.865 --> 26:15.575
before it became romantic.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.410
Uh, we met during the war,

26:17.494 --> 26:19.954
and though
that was not a fun time,

26:20.038 --> 26:23.416
I was most struck
by how much fun

26:23.500 --> 26:24.959
we had together

26:25.043 --> 26:27.796
and how much I wanted
to talk to her,

26:27.879 --> 26:29.839
to hear what she had to say.

26:29.923 --> 26:33.134
We--we really--we really...

26:33.218 --> 26:35.303
did fall into love,

26:35.387 --> 26:38.431
and it wasn't long ago
that she supported me

26:38.515 --> 26:39.599
throughout my career.

26:39.683 --> 26:42.102
Which leads me
to my next question.

26:42.185 --> 26:45.855
You had an impressive career
as a diplomat,

26:45.939 --> 26:50.110
but you stepped back from it
and just gave it all up...

26:51.695 --> 26:54.614
To do nothing
while your wife worked?

26:59.160 --> 27:01.121
I look at it this way.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.375
Julia is the tip
of the iceberg--

27:05.458 --> 27:08.294
exposed, shining,

27:08.378 --> 27:10.463
making her mark on the world.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.216
And I am down below,

27:13.299 --> 27:17.262
holding her up,
anchoring her...

27:17.345 --> 27:19.973
supporting her.

27:20.056 --> 27:23.643
And in that way,
we are partners,

27:23.727 --> 27:26.855
connected.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.606
I like it.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.114
Drinking alone?

27:36.197 --> 27:38.241
Someone's driven me to it.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.952
Oh, Paul wouldn't want me
to drink that.

27:41.036 --> 27:44.289
No, you're probably right.
He wouldn't.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.584
He wants you
to have the very best.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.252
He adores you.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.886
Why do you treat Paul
the way you do,

27:57.969 --> 28:01.556
belittling him,
undermining him?

28:01.639 --> 28:02.891
We're twins.

28:02.974 --> 28:05.185
We have a certain dynamic
you wouldn't understand.

28:05.268 --> 28:07.771
Wouldn't I?

28:07.854 --> 28:10.440
You want to keep Paul
in your shadow all the time.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.150
That's how he likes it.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.152
He seeks out the shadows.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.115
It isn't generous,

28:19.199 --> 28:20.950
and it isn't kind.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.119
Some people grow.

28:23.203 --> 28:26.915
Paul prefers to shrink.

28:26.998 --> 28:30.543
And that has worked out
very well for you,

28:30.627 --> 28:32.045
now, hasn't it?

29:19.843 --> 29:23.221
Life is just
a bowl of cherries

29:23.304 --> 29:27.517
So live and laugh at it all

29:27.600 --> 29:30.729
Keep repeating,
it's the berries

29:30.812 --> 29:34.315
You know, the strongest
oak has got to fall

29:34.399 --> 29:35.650
Nice.

29:35.734 --> 29:38.903
The best things in life
to you are just loaned

29:38.987 --> 29:43.283
- So how can you lose
- What you've never owned?

29:43.366 --> 29:46.411
Life is just
a bowl of cherries

29:46.494 --> 29:48.913
So live it

29:48.997 --> 29:51.207
- Love it
- Here we go.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.834
Wiggle your ears

29:52.917 --> 29:55.003
Think nothing of it

29:55.086 --> 29:57.422
- Can't do without it
- There's no doubt about it

29:57.505 --> 29:59.215
There's no two ways
about it

29:59.299 --> 30:00.800
You live

30:00.884 --> 30:05.096
And you laugh at it all

30:06.598 --> 30:09.976
Life's a bowl of cherries,
just look out for the pits

30:16.107 --> 30:18.818
- You wanted to see me, Hunter?
- Yes. Come in.

30:18.902 --> 30:20.111
Sit down.

30:24.657 --> 30:27.827
"By Women, For Women"--

30:27.911 --> 30:31.289
it's really something.

30:31.373 --> 30:32.290
I'm so proud of you.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.459
And that--
that Kathleen Gordon--

30:34.542 --> 30:36.670
- she's dynamite.
- Oh, she's the best.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.171
The panelists too--all great.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.132
Oh, you really think so?
That is such a relief.

30:41.216 --> 30:44.052
It's what I asked for...

30:44.135 --> 30:46.262
Totally ahead of its time.

30:46.346 --> 30:49.349
- It's groundbreaking.
- Hmm.

30:50.934 --> 30:53.478
But sometimes ground

30:53.561 --> 30:55.897
is better left intact.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.857
I mean that...

30:57.941 --> 31:01.403
sometimes we aren't ready
to lose the ground.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.863
You know,
ground is a good thing.

31:03.947 --> 31:06.282
Oh, you mean we should
keep the show grounded?

31:06.366 --> 31:07.826
because I-I completely agree.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.244
The whole focus is on issues

31:09.327 --> 31:11.079
that women deal with
every single day--

31:11.162 --> 31:13.498
divorce, sexism, abortion.

31:13.581 --> 31:14.874
We're working on an episode

31:14.958 --> 31:16.376
on inequality
in higher education.

31:16.459 --> 31:19.295
Uh, no,
what I actually mean is,

31:19.379 --> 31:23.550
uh, "By Women, For Women"
is far ahead of its time, yes--

31:25.176 --> 31:26.886
Too far ahead.

31:28.555 --> 31:30.890
"Too far ahead"?

31:30.974 --> 31:35.061
I was going to show
the pilot to Tilly

31:35.145 --> 31:36.521
to see what she thought,

31:36.604 --> 31:39.524
and then I realized
I already knew what she'd say.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.902
She won't watch something
like "By Women, For Women."

31:42.986 --> 31:45.030
Her friends won't either.

31:45.113 --> 31:48.825
The material with that host--

31:48.908 --> 31:51.536
it's too much.

31:51.619 --> 31:55.915
Maybe in San Francisco
or Los Angeles.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.543
I mean, Hal and the board
won't go for it.

31:58.626 --> 32:02.297
WGBH, our audience...

32:02.380 --> 32:05.383
they aren't ready for it...

32:05.467 --> 32:06.926
not yet.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.470
I'm sorry.

32:10.638 --> 32:13.933
You did great work...

32:14.017 --> 32:16.811
but we can't air it.

32:16.895 --> 32:19.898
I mean, this is still Boston.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.235
It certainly is...

32:25.862 --> 32:27.739
As long as we let it be.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.889
- Oh.
- Thank you.

32:57.102 --> 32:58.978
So...

32:59.062 --> 33:01.189
tell me the story
of "The French Chef."

33:01.272 --> 33:02.482
How did it happen?

33:02.565 --> 33:04.901
How did you come up
with the idea?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.028
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.447
You give me
far too much credit.

33:09.531 --> 33:12.492
Alice, Russ, we need you.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.411
No, the people
who make the show

33:14.494 --> 33:16.830
must tell the story with me.

33:16.913 --> 33:20.125
It was Alice Naman here,
a magnificent producer,

33:20.208 --> 33:22.836
who first booked me
on "I've Been Reading,"

33:22.919 --> 33:27.424
Albert Duhamel's hit show,
isn't that right?

33:27.507 --> 33:31.052
Yes. Yes, I did book you
on that hit series.

33:31.136 --> 33:35.015
And then Russ Morash,
our gifted director,

33:35.098 --> 33:38.226
came up with this wild idea
for a cooking show,

33:38.309 --> 33:40.979
isn't that right, Russ?

33:43.481 --> 33:47.027
Russ, you saw something
in the first episode

33:47.110 --> 33:50.155
of "I've Been Reading,"
perhaps.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.034
That's true.
I did.

33:54.117 --> 33:57.120
Julia's talent was undeniable,
right off the bat.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.875
Uh, and her chemistry
with--with Albert was palpable.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.543
I knew we had something.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.795
He encouraged me
to make a pilot.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.255
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.632
Ha ha.
Yeah, exactly.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.719
I-it just all made sense.

34:12.802 --> 34:16.264
"The French Chef," the TV show,
you could see it clear as day.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.933
- Isn't that right, Al?
- Oh, yep.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.351
Yep, that's right. He, um--

34:20.435 --> 34:22.437
You wouldn't take no
for an answer.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.688
Oh, I was unsure at first,

34:24.773 --> 34:28.068
but their belief
made me believe.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.737
And so, with the support of our
intrepid leader, Hunter Fox,

34:31.821 --> 34:33.489
we tried it out,

34:33.572 --> 34:38.244
and our little experiment
brought us here.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.580
You really seem
like a family.

34:40.663 --> 34:42.916
Except we all
like each other.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.085
You're exactly right, Noel.

34:45.168 --> 34:46.378
We are a family.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.295
I'm Roland, by the way.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.505
Hmm.

34:49.589 --> 34:52.717
So what is the secret
to the show's success?

34:52.801 --> 34:55.136
- You know--
- It's Julia.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.596
It's all Julia.

35:06.398 --> 35:10.777
Well, that was sticky,
indeed...

35:10.860 --> 35:13.947
and the good thing
about this yule log

35:14.030 --> 35:18.034
is that after decorating
and trimming it,

35:18.118 --> 35:20.537
you can sit and eat it, too,

35:20.620 --> 35:23.957
which is more than you can say
for a Christmas tree.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.543
Now, this is
an economy-size log

35:26.626 --> 35:28.128
meant for a festive party.

35:28.211 --> 35:30.964
But if you're not having
that many guests,

35:31.047 --> 35:35.468
then you can always tuck some
of your cake into one of these

35:35.552 --> 35:38.138
- and save a slice for later.
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.643
Well, that's all for today
on "The French Chef."

35:43.727 --> 35:46.604
This is Julia Child.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.273
Bon appétit.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.608
And cut.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.195
Dig in, everyone.

35:57.073 --> 35:59.409
Thank you, Danny.
Thank you, Lloyd.

35:59.492 --> 36:00.702
Where's Terry?

36:00.785 --> 36:03.997
Well done, Terry, as usual.
My thanks.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.791
Come forward.
Don't be polite.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.002
So much to go around.

36:23.308 --> 36:27.228
Julia, can I ask
you something?

36:27.312 --> 36:29.022
Yes.

36:29.105 --> 36:32.275
Why did you lie
about "The French Chef"?

36:32.359 --> 36:34.361
It was entirely your idea.

36:34.444 --> 36:37.072
In fact, you single-handedly
made it happen.

36:37.155 --> 36:40.992
Well, you helped quite a bit.

36:41.076 --> 36:43.870
I did what I could,
but, really, it was all you.

36:43.953 --> 36:48.416
Russ didn't even want to try.
He tried to stop it.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.045
It's so hard to get credit
for anything as a woman.

36:52.128 --> 36:54.047
I guess what I want to know is,

36:54.130 --> 36:56.925
why did you give
your own credit away?

36:57.008 --> 36:59.511
Well, Alice, no one
likes an ambitious woman.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.638
It isn't ladylike.

37:01.721 --> 37:05.225
There are games
we have to play to be heard.

37:05.308 --> 37:07.560
That's just how it is.

37:09.938 --> 37:10.897
Very good.

37:10.980 --> 37:14.192
I love what we have--
long artichokes.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.152
I love the table.
I love the light.

37:16.236 --> 37:18.071
Julia, you may do the chicken.

37:18.154 --> 37:20.865
You may pull it out of the
oven, and you just assist.

37:20.949 --> 37:21.783
Yes.

37:21.866 --> 37:23.910
Actually, move in
a little closer.

37:23.993 --> 37:28.164
All right, good, and a smile
from Julia and a smile.

37:28.248 --> 37:30.083
She looks like a linebacker
next to him.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.085
Smile, or whatever that is.

37:32.168 --> 37:35.255
Very good. Good.
Very good, natural.

37:35.338 --> 37:39.384
You see that out there?
That is a very pretty picture.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.886
That's it, there.
Perfect.

37:41.970 --> 37:44.639
Do not mess with it.

37:44.723 --> 37:48.393
If your article has even
a hint of a hit piece,

37:48.476 --> 37:50.687
I'll make sure you spend
the rest of your days

37:50.770 --> 37:54.190
in the "Reader's Digest"
holiday section.

37:54.274 --> 37:55.525
Got it?

37:55.608 --> 37:58.570
Paul, maybe a little salt
on those potatoes.

37:58.653 --> 38:01.531
Let me do this, and you salt
the--maybe the chicken--

38:01.614 --> 38:03.116
Very good.

38:03.199 --> 38:05.493
Now, if you would sprinkle
the salt, but go high.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.287
Start low and go high,
because--

38:07.370 --> 38:10.582
Careful, sunshine.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.169
It's her fault.
She tickled me.

38:14.252 --> 38:16.129
- I--
- You did.

38:16.212 --> 38:18.715
Unbelievable.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.718
Avis, we need you here.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.724
Can you smell that?

38:27.807 --> 38:30.852
Isn't that wonderful?

38:30.935 --> 38:33.438
Hold the back.

38:33.521 --> 38:35.648
Oh, goodness.

38:38.526 --> 38:40.695
Like this?
Yeah.

38:40.779 --> 38:42.405
That's nice.

38:42.489 --> 38:44.616
Hold on. Hold on.
Here you go.

38:44.699 --> 38:45.700
Take this.

38:45.784 --> 38:48.161
Two, three, cheers.

38:49.412 --> 38:51.915
Fabulous, just like that.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.671
"Life" magazine!
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?

39:03.718 --> 39:05.553
- Should we do another toast?
- Yes.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.305
Here we go.

39:25.907 --> 39:27.784
You know, you
might not believe me,

39:27.867 --> 39:29.577
but I know something
about fiction.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.996
We tell stories
about our lives,

39:32.080 --> 39:36.001
and over time, our lives
become those stories.

39:36.084 --> 39:38.712
You've been telling
yourself a story--

39:38.795 --> 39:41.089
that I'm the reason
you stopped writing.

39:41.172 --> 39:42.674
Stop doing that.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.885
If you want to be a novelist,
you have to keep going.

39:45.969 --> 39:48.596
It took Julia a decade
to write "Mastering."

39:48.680 --> 39:52.017
Just get out of your own way.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.311
If you do write something,
send it to me.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.816
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

39:59.899 --> 40:01.026
Thank you.

40:01.109 --> 40:03.570
My question is, what is
the ratio between wattage

40:03.653 --> 40:06.614
that you would need and area
that you would have?

40:06.698 --> 40:09.325
Is there a formula
that you use?

40:11.244 --> 40:14.497
I think Stanley enjoyed
this more than anyone.

40:14.581 --> 40:17.208
He can't get enough
of the glitz and the glamour.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.378
So sweet, my little sunshine.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.839
Oh, I feel like
a teenager again.

40:24.424 --> 40:26.134
- Mmm.
- Yes.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.888
What?

40:33.058 --> 40:35.352
Oh, please.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.270
You're one to talk.

40:37.354 --> 40:40.815
You and Paul wrote the book on
public displays of affection.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.609
There's a time and a place.

40:42.692 --> 40:45.904
Holiday cards?
Restaurants?

40:45.987 --> 40:49.115
You were here
to support me as my friend,

40:49.199 --> 40:53.370
and you spent
the whole time canoodling.

40:56.122 --> 40:59.459
I came here today
because you asked me to,

40:59.542 --> 41:03.254
even though I already had plans
with Stanley.

41:03.338 --> 41:07.926
And if I wasn't by your side
every moment, I'm sorry,

41:08.009 --> 41:11.054
but I almost always am.

41:11.137 --> 41:14.891
Besides, Judith
is here and Paul.

41:14.974 --> 41:18.478
But in front of the crew,
Avis, the writer,

41:18.561 --> 41:21.022
it's embarrassing.

41:25.777 --> 41:28.697
You know...

41:28.780 --> 41:30.949
friendship is a two-way street.

41:31.032 --> 41:33.118
Put up with me.

41:33.201 --> 41:35.620
I put up with you.

41:41.334 --> 41:43.211
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

41:43.294 --> 41:45.171
Thank you.
Thank you for all the photos.

41:49.801 --> 41:52.387
- What are you doing?
- I'm off.

41:52.470 --> 41:53.930
Now?

41:54.014 --> 41:55.724
At least wait till tomorrow.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.517
I was hoping
for another jam session.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.436
No, no.
I spoke with Freddie.

41:59.519 --> 42:01.521
All seems forgiven.

42:01.604 --> 42:04.733
I don't want to miss
her window of goodwill.

42:04.816 --> 42:08.361
It was--that was quite
a photo back there.

42:08.445 --> 42:09.487
Thank you.

42:09.571 --> 42:11.072
Very skilled lighting crew.

42:11.156 --> 42:13.450
You weren't in Julia's shadow,
for once.

42:15.452 --> 42:16.953
Of course I was.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.830
It's a lovely place to be.

42:20.457 --> 42:22.667
I know it's not easy
being my twin.

42:22.751 --> 42:26.046
Oh, I thought
it was the other way around.

42:29.049 --> 42:32.427
I don't measure myself
by you,

42:32.510 --> 42:36.723
but I play your game
because it matters to you

42:36.806 --> 42:38.391
and I love you.

42:42.354 --> 42:44.773
I've always wondered...

42:44.856 --> 42:46.691
whether Mother favored you

42:46.775 --> 42:50.070
because she knew
you needed it more,

42:50.153 --> 42:53.990
or maybe she was just sadistic.

42:54.074 --> 42:57.952
Well, I thought it was
just because I'm older.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.788
Either way...

42:59.871 --> 43:02.791
here we are.

43:02.874 --> 43:04.334
I'm glad you came.

43:08.296 --> 43:10.799
I love you, too, brother,

43:10.882 --> 43:14.094
and so does your wife,
for what it's worth.

43:18.223 --> 43:21.309
I look forward to reading
your article on the crapper.

43:21.393 --> 43:22.811
That's nice.

43:24.771 --> 43:27.023
Oh, and please say goodbye

43:27.107 --> 43:31.695
to Ju-u-u-u-lia.

43:43.581 --> 43:45.041
Delicious.

43:49.796 --> 43:53.591
People don't really know us,
do they?

43:53.675 --> 43:56.636
They don't,
and they don't need to.

44:06.563 --> 44:08.857
They said they wanted
female programming--

44:08.940 --> 44:10.900
nothing else like it on TV.

44:10.984 --> 44:12.485
Yeah, it's terrible.

44:12.569 --> 44:15.864
Yeah, it's goddamn terrible.

44:15.947 --> 44:18.324
I mean, aren't you angry?

44:18.408 --> 44:20.869
Of course I'm upset.
I'm just as upset as you are.

44:20.952 --> 44:23.663
I'm just not as surprised.

44:26.958 --> 44:29.252
Oh, that makes sense.

44:29.336 --> 44:32.714
Too far ahead
of its time, he said.

44:32.797 --> 44:34.299
With that host?

44:36.760 --> 44:38.345
Still Boston, he said.

44:38.428 --> 44:40.930
So fucking racist.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.515
Cowards.

44:46.603 --> 44:48.605
Mmm.

44:52.192 --> 44:53.234
Good morning.

44:53.318 --> 44:54.694
Julia.

44:56.071 --> 44:58.782
- You were great yesterday.
- Oh.

44:58.865 --> 45:01.368
GE is pleased as punch.

45:01.451 --> 45:04.454
Uh, Tupperware already called
to do another spot.

45:07.707 --> 45:09.542
Hunter...

45:09.626 --> 45:13.630
people watch our show
because the audience trusts me.

45:14.881 --> 45:16.549
I'm not selling
them something,

45:16.633 --> 45:17.884
if you see my meaning.

45:17.967 --> 45:20.428
We're all selling
something, Julia.

45:20.512 --> 45:22.639
Well, I'm not.

45:22.722 --> 45:25.892
No more product placements.
I'm covering all the labels.

45:25.975 --> 45:28.395
From now on,
we go back to how it was.

45:28.478 --> 45:30.188
We can't do that.

45:30.271 --> 45:31.898
There's too much money
at stake.

45:31.981 --> 45:35.026
I-i-it's not just about you
and "The French Chef."

45:35.110 --> 45:39.155
Product placement saves
the station, funds new shows.

45:39.239 --> 45:41.866
Like Alice's?

45:41.950 --> 45:43.785
Yes, I heard about that.

45:43.868 --> 45:45.745
My neck is on the line here.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.372
"The French Chef"
is the one show

45:47.455 --> 45:48.623
at this station that works.

45:48.707 --> 45:50.417
You won't save your job
by changing it,

45:50.500 --> 45:52.627
and besides, I won't do it--
it's that simple.

45:52.711 --> 45:53.920
Am I clear?

45:54.004 --> 45:57.424
The only brand I'm selling on
"The French Chef" is honesty.

45:58.925 --> 46:02.971
Now, if you'll excuse me...

46:03.054 --> 46:04.806
I have a show to make.
