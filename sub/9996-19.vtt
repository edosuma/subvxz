00:38.239 --> 00:40.708
(beeping)

00:45.679 --> 00:47.615
(doorbell rings)

00:49.483 --> 00:51.585
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.020
Happened to be in
the neighborhood.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.122
Thought I'd
bring dinner by.

00:54.122 --> 00:57.658
Real dinner, not
that microwave stuff.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.662
Hmm, you just happened to be
in the neighborhood, huh?

01:03.664 --> 01:07.268
(door closes)

01:07.268 --> 01:11.572
Maybe I didn't think
you should be alone tonight.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.073
You remembered.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.443
Of course I remembered.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.245
Today's the anniversary.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.614
One year ago today, your
entire family was slaughtered.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.617
(gasps)

01:24.718 --> 01:27.188

ALLISON:
Marie.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.111
Turn it down,
Marie.

02:24.111 --> 02:24.945
But because it was so sweet

02:24.945 --> 02:26.680
and pointless of you
to offer to come...

02:26.680 --> 02:28.916
Marie, damn it.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.850
(turns television off)

02:30.951 --> 02:33.020
Don't get me wrong,

02:33.020 --> 02:34.455
but you seem
a little, uh,

02:34.455 --> 02:35.556
tightly wound
this morning.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.325
Yeah, well, I feel a
little tightly wound.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.659
My head is killing me.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.561
That dream keeps rattling
around in my head.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.231
Al, come on now, we stayed up
over an hour talking about that.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.966
Yeah, I know.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.169
Wouldn't want to miss out on the
cell phones and the gift bags.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.306
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
listen to me.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.309
It was a bad dream,
a bad dream

02:55.309 --> 02:57.010
about losing your kids,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.913
and that's a dream that every
parent has at some point.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.015
Yeah, I know, I was there
the first time you said it.

03:02.015 --> 03:02.816
Then just think
about it, Al.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.185
Everything you told me
about this dream--

03:05.185 --> 03:06.420
all the places,
all the people--

03:06.420 --> 03:08.989
you said yourself you didn't
recognize any of 'em.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.625
Okay, so maybe, maybe,
don't you think that maybe

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
that just might mean
that it wasn't real?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.795
And until you--
wait, hold on--

03:14.795 --> 03:16.029
until you see something
that is real,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.199
that makes it real, that's
the way we have to think.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.769
'Cause we can't start
living our lives

03:21.769 --> 03:24.204
like this is,
this is our last year.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.340
We can't do that
to our kids.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.243
I love you, too,

03:29.243 --> 03:31.011
Mommy.
Marie,

03:31.011 --> 03:33.080
Mom doesn't want you to read
the notes until lunchtime.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.349
Otherwise, she'd just hand 'em
to you with your cereal

03:35.349 --> 03:38.118
in the morning.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.219
It's all right, Marie.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.454
I'll write you a new note.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.022
Hey, uh, don't forget.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.725
I don't have Dad's car today,
so I'm going to need a ride

03:44.725 --> 03:46.694
to the Art Institute
after school.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.462
They're, uh,
having dance tryouts

03:48.462 --> 03:50.163
for this summer's
dance program.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.132
Uh, check your bag.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.268
Oh, Mom, you didn't.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.476
Okay, you do know
that I'm 16, right?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.916
I don't think it's going
to fit me.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.784
(laughs)

04:10.784 --> 04:13.587
There are some onesies in here,
and I think some dresses.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.989
Some of the stuff goes
all the way back to Ariel,

04:15.989 --> 04:18.426
so feel free to toss
whatever you don't want.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.296
Scanlon.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.032
MAN:
Oh, my God!

04:25.032 --> 04:26.900
Please, don't hurt me.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.807
I beg you, no! Please!

04:33.807 --> 04:35.476
Don't!
(thud, man yells)

04:41.081 --> 04:43.283
I don't understand.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.486
I know you're going to kill me.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.488
Why not just kill me?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.323
'Cause this is more fun.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.097
(screaming)

04:57.097 --> 04:59.600
SCANLON:
Allison?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.968
You need something else?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.103
Uh... who sits at this desk?

05:03.103 --> 05:06.540
Uh, most of the time,
a detective named Luis Ruiz.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.342
But, uh, he's been
out on assignment

05:08.342 --> 05:09.643
for about two months.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.111
Cloak and dagger stuff.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.814
I actually have no idea
what he's doing. Why?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.752
Everything I'm about
to tell you

05:18.752 --> 05:20.320
is highly classified
information.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.555
I'm sure you two
have heard about

05:21.555 --> 05:23.991
what's going on down in Mexico.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.493
The carnage, it's...

05:25.493 --> 05:28.195
like nothing they've
ever seen before.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.296
Gunfights in
the streets,

05:29.296 --> 05:30.664
wholesale murder,
body count's

05:30.664 --> 05:32.232
well into the thousands.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
It's a drug war.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.603
Two rival cartels
are fighting over

05:35.603 --> 05:37.337
territories and distribution.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.106
And now,
some of that fighting is

05:39.106 --> 05:41.041
spilling over the border.
Seen a rash

05:41.041 --> 05:43.043
of kidnappings and homicides
across Arizona

05:43.043 --> 05:45.345
that we believe is connected
to what's going on down south.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.550
Allison, that detective that you
think might be in danger,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.485
he's actually been
working undercover

05:51.485 --> 05:52.953
as a part of a joint
investigation

05:52.953 --> 05:54.187
between us
and the Drug Enforcement Agency.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.357
Miraculously, he's
managed to get inside

05:57.357 --> 05:59.460
one of the cartel's operations
right here in Phoenix.

05:59.460 --> 06:03.363
No law enforcement agency has
ever had a man in so deep

06:03.363 --> 06:04.398
with one of these
organizations.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.699
Well, that's great.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.367
When's the last time anyone
actually heard from him?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.170
Well, when a man is working
that deep undercover,

06:10.170 --> 06:13.173
he can't be expected to check in
with any regularity...

06:13.173 --> 06:16.744
Now that man that you
saw torturing him...

06:16.744 --> 06:19.547
Yeah, the one with the burn
scar on his face.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.951
Oh, my God.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.118
This is him.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.153
I was afraid of that.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.287
Oswaldo Castillo.

06:27.287 --> 06:30.591
He's, uh, he's been the cartel's
top enforcer for years.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.760
Now, he specializes
in the assassination

06:32.760 --> 06:34.428
of Mexican politicians

06:34.428 --> 06:35.596
and judges.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.097
We've suspected
for a long while

06:37.097 --> 06:39.933
that the cartel has stationed
him here in Arizona.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.804
But, um, no one's been able
to lay eyes on him.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.606
His presence here would
certainly explain

06:45.606 --> 06:48.075
this rash of violence.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.146
Hey, you.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.351
Okay, I'll ask.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.253
Why are you looking
at me like that?

07:00.253 --> 07:03.290
Allison, everybody's been trying
to reach you for two hours.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.193
3:00, Ariel?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.528
Dance tryouts?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.929
Art Institute?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.465
Oh, my God, I...

07:11.465 --> 07:14.635
I was supposed
to go get her.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.436
I completely forgot.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.706
It's okay.
She called me.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.208
I postponed a conference call
and I got her there.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.409
I don't understand.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.844
How could she not get
ahold of me?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.012
Well, she called your office

07:25.012 --> 07:26.446
and they said you were
behind closed doors.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.447
And we both tried your cell,

07:27.447 --> 07:29.717
and it just went
straight to voice mail.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.586
I don't even remember
turning this off.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.989
(sighs):
Oh, God...

07:35.989 --> 07:36.990
Al, you okay?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.859
Yeah, it's nothing,
I just have this headache

07:38.859 --> 07:40.828
and I just can't seem
to shake it.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.730
Do you want me
to call Dr. Berman,

07:42.730 --> 07:44.998
see if he can squeeze
you in first thing
in the morning?

07:44.998 --> 07:47.968
Joe, It's a headache.
I know,

07:47.968 --> 07:50.203
but I'm leaving
for San Diego tomorrow,

07:50.203 --> 07:51.839
so if you're coming
down with something...

07:51.839 --> 07:53.373
I'm not coming down with
something; it's a headache.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.543
It'll pass.
Promise you.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.010
You know, I can,
I can make it

07:57.010 --> 07:59.880
through three
days without you.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.482
If you really
want to help me,

08:02.482 --> 08:05.018
why don't you get the girls
dinner and put them to bed,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
so I can just crawl
under the covers

08:07.020 --> 08:08.956
and try to sleep
this thing off?

08:14.227 --> 08:15.262
Okay, go ahead.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.197
Crawl away.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.301
Hey.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.903
By the way, she got in.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.705
Ariel.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.173
She nailed the tryout.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.178
Excellent.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.287
ALLISON:
Sorry I'm late.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.453
That's okay.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.155
You said it was important.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.892
Oswaldo Castillo.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.126
I think I might
have found someone

08:46.126 --> 08:48.662
who knows where he is.
Who?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.397
His doctor.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.732
His name's Hector Cruz.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.934
He's in Guadalajara, Mexico.
Wait a second.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.569
Where'd you
come up with this?

08:55.569 --> 08:59.139
I hired another
private detective.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.608
You're telling me you hired
another private eye

09:00.608 --> 09:02.710
to hunt for Oswaldo Castillo
after the last one

09:02.710 --> 09:04.211
took all your money
and disappeared?

09:04.211 --> 09:07.314
Do you not understand that I
do this for a living?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.016
Well, according to him,

09:09.016 --> 09:11.551
this Cruz is
some kind of mob doctor.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.320
He treats wounded
cartel soldiers

09:13.320 --> 09:14.655
after-hours in his clinic.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.523
If we could just
get in there,

09:16.523 --> 09:18.091
if we could
get into his files.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.693
He's got to have
some kind of a way

09:19.693 --> 09:22.095
to contact his patients.
Not necessarily,

09:22.095 --> 09:24.331
if in fact, he's even really
Castillo's doctor.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.234
If in fact, he's even gone
to see him in the last year.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.535
Or ten years or whatever.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.471
Not to mention the fact that
you're talking about Mexico.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.306
I have no jurisdiction
in Mexico.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.608
You know that.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.043
And even if I did,

09:36.043 --> 09:38.145
we don't know that
any of this is true.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.080
I'm sorry.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.683
The best I can do is to pass
this doctor's name along

09:42.683 --> 09:43.784
to the Mexican authorities.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.253
That's the best
you can do?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.023
Look into his eyes
and you tell me

09:50.023 --> 09:51.458
that you give a damn
about jurisdiction.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.761
Look at him!

09:53.761 --> 09:56.096
This is the man
who murdered your wife.

09:56.096 --> 10:00.267
This is the man
who massacred my family!

10:00.267 --> 10:01.935
No!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.336
(cries)

10:04.604 --> 10:06.740
(phone ringing)

10:09.342 --> 10:12.112
Hello?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.614
No, you didn't wake me.
It's only 8:30.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.416
(door opens)

10:16.416 --> 10:19.286
Yes, Mr. District Attorney.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.157
Wherever you need me to go.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.558
(sirens whooping,
indistinct radio transmission)

10:25.558 --> 10:26.994
ALLISON:
What am I looking at?

10:28.561 --> 10:29.963
Do you remember
the police officer

10:29.963 --> 10:31.098
who was working
undercover?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.466
The one you were
so concerned about?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.168
That's him.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.771
In the coolers in
about a dozen pieces.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.075
This is, uh, this is his house.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.414
Oh, my God, that poor woman.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.382
Unfortunately, this is
pretty standard stuff

10:49.382 --> 10:50.918
for these cartels.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.753
Targeting the families
of their enemies,

10:52.753 --> 10:53.987
of law enforcement agents.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.390
Makes people think twice
about investigating them.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.059
The DEA's going to be

10:59.059 --> 11:00.961
setting up a task force
in our offices

11:00.961 --> 11:01.962
until this is solved.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.363
If it's all right with you,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.632
I'd like to introduce you to my
colleague on the federal side.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.201
He is the guy who's going
to be running their whole show.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.939
Believe it or not, he lost
his wife to a cartel car bomb

11:11.939 --> 11:13.273
just a few weeks ago.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.042
They murdered his wife?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.549
Agent Muñoz.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.853
Special Agent
Daniel Muñoz,

11:25.853 --> 11:28.155
I'd like you to meet
Allison Dubois.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.998
Daniel Muñoz-- that's his name,
Special Agent Daniel Muñoz.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.167
He's completely real.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.969
I know, I hear you, I hear you,
I hear you.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.703
He's real, Joe.
I didn't make him up.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.005
He worked for the DEA.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.573
Not only that,
they murdered his wife.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.541
Who-who murdered
this guy's wife?

11:48.541 --> 11:49.977
Oswaldo Castillo.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.845
He did it with a car bomb.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.213
He's a professional killer.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.515
He works for this drug cartel.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.950
He's the one that I saw

11:56.950 --> 11:58.285
torturing that detective.
Okay.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.420
This is it--
this is what he does.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.390
He kills people.
He kills people's families.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.427
Well, say something.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.197
And we're next, right?
Me and the kids, we're next?

12:10.197 --> 12:11.799
That's where you're
going, right?

12:11.799 --> 12:14.601
Why do you say this
like it's a question?
I'm sorry, Allison,

12:14.601 --> 12:16.503
I don't know how to continue
this conversation

12:16.503 --> 12:17.404
unless it's a question.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.172
How do you want
me to continue?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.573
Like it's a certainty--

12:20.573 --> 12:23.576
my death, my children's deaths,
they're absolutely certain?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.846
Well, hey, let's just
go get the cyanide

12:25.846 --> 12:27.214
and end it all
right now.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.982
What the hell do you want me
to do, Allison? Come on.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.650
Isn't it enough that
my life is over,

12:30.650 --> 12:32.052
but now you're upset with me

12:32.052 --> 12:33.253
because I'm not reacting to it
properly?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.055
What is it you want me to do?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.656
What is it I want
you to do?

12:36.656 --> 12:39.226
What is it I want
you to do?!

12:39.226 --> 12:41.862
I want you to get your ass
out of that damn bed,

12:41.862 --> 12:43.363
and I want you
to keep us safe!

12:43.363 --> 12:45.799
I want you to act
like you give a damn!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.567
Like what I'm saying
matters to you!

12:47.567 --> 12:49.402
Of course it matters to me,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.571
It completely matters.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.241
But I don't know what to tell
you to do about it

12:54.241 --> 12:56.509
if you're already convinced
that doing anything is useless.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.946
And I don't think that
waking the kids

12:58.946 --> 13:01.414
by yelling at each other
is the answer either.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.426
There were five ice chests.

13:13.426 --> 13:17.898
Each with a different piece
of that police detective in it.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.266
I understand.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.634
And I believe
you, I do--

13:21.634 --> 13:22.735
I absolutely believe you.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.272
But I also believe that standing
out in the sun too long

13:25.272 --> 13:27.274
is going to give me cancer,
but I'll be damned

13:27.274 --> 13:30.077
if the kids and I are are going
to spend the rest of our lives

13:30.077 --> 13:30.944
hiding in the dark.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.280
What kind of an answer is that?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.282
That's the only answer
I have, Allison.

13:35.282 --> 13:39.486
I can't believe that
our fate is sealed, I can't.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.353
Life is about choices.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.489
You've just got to make
the right ones.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.291
Well, what are they?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.625
Okay, let's
say you're right.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.928
Let's say that we're a target
for these cartel people

13:47.928 --> 13:49.296
because you work
in law enforcement, okay?

13:49.296 --> 13:50.297
Then the answer's pretty simple.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.500
You got to stop working
in law enforcement.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.102
You're right.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.536
Of course I'm right.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.305
I got to quit.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.507
I mean, I know Devalos
is counting on me,

14:00.507 --> 14:01.608
but I have to quit,

14:01.608 --> 14:04.077
and I have to make sure
that they know that I did.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.113
That's right, for the sake
of your family,

14:06.113 --> 14:07.347
that's what you have to do,
absolutely.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.316
I mean, there's no other choice,
is there?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.351
I mean, if you're
convinced that
we're in danger,

14:11.351 --> 14:12.685
if you're absolutely
certain of it,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
no, yeah, you-you got to go
into work tomorrow,

14:15.655 --> 14:17.657
you got to knock
on Devalos' door

14:17.657 --> 14:19.326
and you got
to say, "I resign--

14:19.326 --> 14:21.328
for the safety
of my family."

14:21.328 --> 14:24.697
Of course, if you're
convinced that we're
all going to die anyway,

14:24.697 --> 14:25.966
what's the point?

14:27.667 --> 14:32.039
Which is why the choice
that I would advocate

14:32.039 --> 14:33.240
involves two things.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.408
First, that you embrace
the possibility

14:35.408 --> 14:37.344
that these things that
you're dreaming about

14:37.344 --> 14:39.079
might not be set in stone.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.647
And secondly, secondly,

14:40.647 --> 14:42.182
that you do your job,

14:42.182 --> 14:44.351
you do your job as if
your life depended on it.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.254
As if your family's life
depended on it.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.389
And then-then you might be able
to find this guy, this...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.191
Oswaldo Castillo.
Oswaldo Castillo.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.193
You find him
and you put him away.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.262
You put the people
that he works for away.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.364
And then, there's no reason

14:57.364 --> 14:59.232
for anyone to kill
your family anymore.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.501
And there's no one left
around to do it.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.588
MAN:
You sleep here?

15:21.588 --> 15:24.191
It's Allison, right?

15:24.191 --> 15:25.492
Well, I'm impressed, Allison.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.161
None of my agents ever beat me
into the office.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.232
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.236
Don't be.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.338
My wife's murder
is part of this case.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.408
So is this
how it works?

15:41.408 --> 15:44.611
Your thing-- you look at a file,
hope something comes to you?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.413
(chuckles)

15:46.413 --> 15:49.416
To be perfectly honest, I have
no idea how this thing works.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.352
Or even if it's going to work
on any given day.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.388
But, uh...

15:55.388 --> 15:59.626
yeah, sometimes looking
at pictures, at a file--

15:59.626 --> 16:01.094
sometimes it helps.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.698
Please, I want to show
you something.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.636
This is everything
we've got.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.039
Had it expressed over

16:12.039 --> 16:15.675
from my El Paso field
office last night.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.876
Look at whatever you like.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.578
My files are your files.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.714
MAN (on television):
Hello, everybody!

16:21.714 --> 16:23.583
Welcome to the...
Ariel, come on, hurry up.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.452
Taxi's here to take me
to the airport.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.420
The girls are going
to be late for school

16:27.420 --> 16:29.789
if you don't leave soon.
I'm on it, Dad.
Don't worry.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.259
Uh-oh, Marie's
doing it again.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.894
Marie, you're supposed
to wait until lunchtime
to read Mommy's messages.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.363
Hey, come on,
it's all right.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.331
She doesn't have to wait
if she doesn't want to.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.533
Come on, come on,
you guys got to get going.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.303
Daddy, I can't read this.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.004
Could you please read it to me?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.607
"Marie, have a..."

16:50.443 --> 16:52.612
Let me see yours,
sweetie, can I...?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.617
There.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.705
(sighs)

17:35.688 --> 17:38.091
(doorbell ringing)

17:40.727 --> 17:42.595
(doorbell ringing)

17:45.798 --> 17:48.235
(doorbell ringing)

17:52.405 --> 17:54.374
Hi. Is this 220 Dekalb?

17:54.374 --> 17:57.244
I couldn't find any
number on your house.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.179
Thanks.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.187
Oswaldo.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.559
Tu almuerzo.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.373
I think I know
where we can find him.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.278
I think I know where
Oswaldo Castillo's hiding.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.280
Allison, you don't look well.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.482
Maybe you and I should go
talk about this outside.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.283
No, no.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.218
I saw him.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.119
I just saw Oswaldo Castillo.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
He's at 220 Dekalb.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.291
He's at an old lady's house.

18:44.291 --> 18:48.295
I think her son
was a friend of his.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
Why are you all

18:50.297 --> 18:52.199
just sitting there?

18:52.199 --> 18:54.234
Allison, your nose.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.626
(man speaking Spanish
indistinctly)

19:20.660 --> 19:22.462
(footsteps)

19:33.340 --> 19:35.875
Mrs. Dubois.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.244
Dr. Cruz.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.778
Sorry to keep
you waiting, huh?

19:38.778 --> 19:39.612
Not at all, Doctor.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.980
Thanks for squeezing me in.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.782
Please...

19:42.782 --> 19:43.750
be patient with me.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.152
My English is
a little weak.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.955
We don't get too many tourists
from your country

19:48.955 --> 19:51.090
in these parts of Guadalajara.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.861
(speaking Spanish)

19:54.861 --> 19:59.799
It says that you were hoping
to get a prescription today?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.634
For pain medication?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.869
Mm-hmm.

20:02.869 --> 20:07.374
According to this, you are still
experiencing some pain

20:07.374 --> 20:10.310
from a surgery
that you had a year ago?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.444
A brain surgery.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.547
I had a tumor growing
on my brain stem.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.850
Usually I would just contact
my own doctor for the pills,

20:17.850 --> 20:20.253
but since I wasn't
planning on being back

20:20.253 --> 20:21.888
in the States
for a few days...

20:21.888 --> 20:24.857
You thought you would visit
my humble clinic, huh?

20:30.029 --> 20:34.967
You do realize, Mrs. Dubois,
you are not the first American

20:34.967 --> 20:39.205
to cross the border in search
of narcotic pain medication.

20:39.205 --> 20:42.775
I don't suppose you would have
some documentation

20:42.775 --> 20:44.877
of your surgery.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.813
A MRI perhaps.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.515
Thank you, Doctor.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.783
I understand.

20:50.783 --> 20:54.120
I was just hoping not to cut
my vacation short,

20:54.120 --> 20:56.889
but actually I feel like I got
everything I wanted.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.859
Mrs. Dubois,

20:59.859 --> 21:02.795
do you mind letting me
see your scar?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.397
Pardon me?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.598
Your scar.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.233
I mean, if you did undergo
the procedure

21:07.233 --> 21:10.202
you are describing to me,
it should not be a problem.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.605
Who knows?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.675
It might convince me to give you
the prescription you are after.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.877
For the right price,
of course.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.658
(gasps)

21:31.658 --> 21:34.894
JOE:
Allison, hey, hey,
Allison, hey.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.329
You're awake.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.297
How you feeling? You okay?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.200
My head hurts.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.002
How long have I been here?

21:43.002 --> 21:45.104
Just a few hours.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.138
Listen, Al,

21:46.138 --> 21:50.743
um, they ran some tests
while you were unconscious.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.080
And I need to talk to you
about what they found.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.748
The brain tumor. I know.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.452
I know.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.090
As you can see, you have
a sizable tumor growing

22:04.090 --> 22:05.858
in the region of the medulla.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.327
The medulla's part
of the brain stem.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.562
It regulates
motor functions,

22:09.562 --> 22:12.499
breathing,
heartbeat,

22:12.499 --> 22:13.700
R.E.M. sleep.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.002
The medulla's in charge
of all of that.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.073
These headaches
you've been having?

22:21.073 --> 22:24.076
They're a symptom
of your condition.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.246
As the tumor grows,
there's less space

22:27.246 --> 22:28.815
in your skull for your brain.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.483
And that can cause something
called

22:30.483 --> 22:32.819
elevated intracranial pressure.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.354
And that can lead to all kinds
of side effects,

22:35.354 --> 22:38.090
including difficulty
understanding

22:38.090 --> 22:39.759
and expressing language.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.862
Which might explain the garbled
notes you told me about.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.532
So this tumor,

22:45.532 --> 22:48.501
this thing inside
of her brain,

22:48.501 --> 22:50.269
are we talking cancer?

22:50.269 --> 22:52.872
We have no way of knowing
until we examine the tissue.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.974
And we can't do that without
performing a surgical procedure.

22:54.974 --> 22:59.111
A procedure that we need
to do in any event

22:59.111 --> 23:00.379
to remove the tumor

23:00.379 --> 23:02.915
and relieve the pressure
on the brain.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.052
No, the tumor is benign.
I already know that.

23:06.052 --> 23:06.919
That's good,
Mrs. Dubois.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.121
It's important
to think positively.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.523
No, you don't understand.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.092
I know it's benign.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.562
I heard you,
Mrs. Dubois.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.930
And I'm aware
of your reputation.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.568
But even if you're right,
it changes nothing.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.471
We need to get in there.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.839
The tumor is
growing quickly.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.875
If we do not do
something soon,
very soon,

23:28.875 --> 23:32.411
it can lead
to something

23:32.411 --> 23:34.647
we call "herniation
of the brain."

23:34.647 --> 23:38.384
And that can
cause paralysis,

23:38.384 --> 23:42.088
coma... and even death.

23:42.088 --> 23:42.955
It's okay.

23:42.955 --> 23:47.093
None of those things
are gonna happen to me.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.530
When do we do this?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.831
As soon as
possible.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.166
I'd like to schedule it
for tomorrow morning.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.703
(gasps)

23:56.703 --> 24:00.106
You want to open up my skull
tomorrow morning?

24:02.241 --> 24:06.178
Okay, I'm fine
with that.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.614
That's excellent.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.421
Girls will be getting out
of school soon.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.856
I want to bring them here

24:16.856 --> 24:18.457
so we that can tell them
both together.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.759
No.
What?

24:19.759 --> 24:21.994
I want you to take the girls
and get out of Phoenix.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.330
I don't care where you
guys go, just stay away.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.765
What? Whoa-whoa-whoa.
What are you talking about?

24:25.765 --> 24:28.200
You are in danger, Joe.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.003
You, the girls.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.205
Everything I've been
dreaming lately,

24:33.205 --> 24:34.206
it's all coming true.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.007
Allison...

24:35.007 --> 24:37.677
And I know if you
and the girls stay here,

24:37.677 --> 24:38.778
you're gonna die.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.013
Allison...
you're ill.

24:41.013 --> 24:44.016
Yeah, now,
but in the future,

24:44.016 --> 24:45.585
in the future,
I am better.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.219
I survive all this.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.321
No! This is serious, Al.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.024
You have a brain tumor!

24:52.024 --> 24:54.594
You're asking me
on the eve of a surgery

24:54.594 --> 24:57.029
that you might not survive,
to-to pack up our kids

24:57.029 --> 25:00.166
and take them as far away
as I possibly can? No!

25:00.166 --> 25:04.070
I'm not listening to your
dreams, not this time.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.271
No!
Yes!

25:05.271 --> 25:06.438
Hey, look at this!

25:06.438 --> 25:07.940
Take a good, long look

25:07.940 --> 25:09.842
'cause this is what
that tumor's doing to you

25:09.842 --> 25:11.043
when you try to write.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.146
Now imagine what it is doing
to you when you try to dream.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.882
I don't care!
No!

25:15.882 --> 25:19.451
Your dreams cannot be trusted
right now. No.

25:19.451 --> 25:26.525
Hey... what if I'm right?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.728
I know I'm sick.

25:28.728 --> 25:32.799
And I know you're worried
about me.

25:32.799 --> 25:37.870
(voice breaking): but please,
I beg of you, please?

25:37.870 --> 25:42.241
(sobbing)
I don't want to survive this
if I can't have my family.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.378
Okay. All right.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.781
Okay, fine. You win.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.816
Okay, I'll go home.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.083
I'll take them to my sister's.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.085
I'll tell them we want them
to stay there

25:53.085 --> 25:55.121
so that I can stay here
in the hospital with you.

25:55.121 --> 25:55.922
Joe!

25:55.922 --> 25:58.625
No! That is the best
that I can do.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.092
Because I need to be here

26:00.092 --> 26:01.794
when you wake up
in the morning.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.730
And I need to be here
every morning

26:03.730 --> 26:05.665
until you're better.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.134
And that is just the way
that it's gonna be.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.906
(knocking)

26:14.607 --> 26:16.075
Allison?

26:23.983 --> 26:26.152
I, uh, I heard
about your illness.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.921
I'm so sorry.

26:42.568 --> 26:43.670
I won't stay long.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.971
I just wanted
to let you know

26:44.971 --> 26:46.973
that we went to that address
you gave us.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.475
Found a bunch of weapons
hidden on the property,

26:49.475 --> 26:50.576
men's clothes,

26:50.576 --> 26:53.680
some fake I.D.s that belonged
to Oswald Castillo.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.381
But not him?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.716
Not him.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.050
We must have just missed him.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.719
He must have known
we were coming

26:59.719 --> 27:00.987
because he left in a hurry.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.722
Left behind his money,
his weapons.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.191
This is a good thing.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.626
We will find him.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.897
I wish I could believe you.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.499
I've dreamt about him, you know.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.102
He wants to hurt my family.

27:16.102 --> 27:20.506
I don't know when,
I don't know where...

27:20.506 --> 27:22.441
but it's coming.

27:22.441 --> 27:27.747
Ma'am, I know we don't know
each other very well,

27:27.747 --> 27:33.853
but today you very nearly led me
to the man who murdered my wife.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.922
These things you've been seeing?

27:35.922 --> 27:38.024
I'm not gonna let 'em happen.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.926
You're not gonna let them
happen.

27:39.926 --> 27:42.628
That's why we're here.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.663
That's why we're in this
together.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.235
Good luck, Allison.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.914
(doorbell rings)

28:08.654 --> 28:10.056
Hey.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.423
Sir, what are you
doing here?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.860
I got the voicemail message
you left me this afternoon.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.595
And you said some very
nice things, Allison,

28:16.595 --> 28:20.032
but I have to admit
the message alarmed me.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.069
All that talk about how glad
you are to have known me.

28:23.069 --> 28:27.239
how appreciative you are of
everything I've done for you.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.408
To be honest, Allison,
it sounded like a good-bye.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.845
I was just depressed.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.613
I guess I just called to say hi.

28:34.613 --> 28:38.684
I got your voicemail
and I just... talked too much.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.952
I'm sorry.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.189
Can I come in?

28:44.623 --> 28:46.826
Oh, sure.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.594
You know, I know
we've been out

28:48.594 --> 28:49.796
of touch for a while,

28:49.796 --> 28:51.798
but I still consider you
a friend, and it's...

28:51.798 --> 28:53.532
Listen, I just have
to ask you this.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.936
You're not considering doing
anything drastic, are you?

28:56.936 --> 28:59.939
No! No, I'm fine.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.842
I mean, some days are
better than others,

29:02.842 --> 29:05.978
but... no, I'm
not planning

29:05.978 --> 29:08.380
on doing anything drastic.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.515
Please.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.524
You, uh...

29:18.524 --> 29:19.959
you going somewhere?

29:21.060 --> 29:24.663
I'm just going out of town
for a couple days.

29:24.663 --> 29:28.067
I see.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.668
Can you put it off?

29:29.668 --> 29:31.871
What for?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.039
Because I'd like you to come

29:33.039 --> 29:34.874
to work for me again
starting right now.

29:34.874 --> 29:38.310
What would I do?
I haven't had a dream in a year.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.879
I don't care.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.814
I'll hire you right now
as a paralegal.

29:41.814 --> 29:42.882
You go back to school.

29:42.882 --> 29:43.950
You finish getting
your law degree.

29:43.950 --> 29:48.020
Look, as long as I have
a job, you have a job.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.692
I don't think so.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.895
Allison...

29:55.895 --> 29:57.363
you have got to move on.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.698
You owe it to the memory
of your family.

29:59.698 --> 30:04.103
I owe it to the memory of my
family to do what I'm doing now.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.472
I could have saved them...

30:06.472 --> 30:07.907
Joe and the girls.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.909
Allison...

30:09.909 --> 30:12.744
Before that operation...

30:12.744 --> 30:14.313
I was dreaming about Castillo.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.115
I was on the path
to finding him.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.117
And I would have found him,
I know it.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.120
But after that surgery,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.957
when I woke up,
it was just gone.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.995
No more visions,
no more dreams.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.597
It was like when they cut
that tumor out,

30:31.597 --> 30:33.565
they cut out my gift, too.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.173
If I'd just put off
that surgery,

30:43.075 --> 30:45.377
my family would still be alive.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.879
(gasping)

30:51.550 --> 30:52.551
Hey. I'm back.

30:52.551 --> 30:53.419
(TV playing)

30:53.419 --> 30:54.987
Um,it's good that you're up.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.356
The nurse said that they're
gonna take you in for surgery

30:57.356 --> 31:04.096
in ten minutes, so I brought
you some stuff from home.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.565
Um, the girls
all wrote you notes.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.200
on paper napkins.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.435
They're hidden in here.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.370
Um, I wasn't supposed
to tell you.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.039
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.590
(moaning)

31:31.590 --> 31:33.525
(cell phone ringing)

31:41.633 --> 31:42.801
Hello?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.270
JOE:
Where the hell are you?

31:44.270 --> 31:45.671
It's... It's okay, Joe.

31:45.671 --> 31:46.838
Really, it's going to be okay.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.274
No, it is not okay.

31:48.274 --> 31:51.643
You ripped out your IV and you
snuck out of your hospital room.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.279
You're supposed
to be in surgery right now.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.913
Yeah, I know.
I can't have that surgery.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.348
What did you say?

31:56.348 --> 31:59.318
I can't have it.
At least not now.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.420
It's going to take away
my dreams, Joe.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.289
It's going to take away my gift.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.624
Allison, what the hell
are you talking about?

32:05.624 --> 32:07.893
Look, I had another dream
last night about the future.

32:07.893 --> 32:10.662
And now... Ow.

32:12.798 --> 32:15.434
And now I know
that if I let them operate,

32:15.434 --> 32:17.636
it's going to be the last dream
that I ever have.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.438
Allison, you're delirious.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.772
You're not making any sense.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.442
I need to keep dreaming.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.445
I need to find out
how I'm supposed to save you.

32:26.445 --> 32:30.182
After that, I swear, I will
come back to the hospital.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.418
I will come back to you.

32:32.418 --> 32:36.422
With any luck, it'll just be
a couple of days.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.491
You could be dead
in a couple of days.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.693
Tell Lee.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.564
T-Tell Lee that he shouldn't
bother checking my credit cards

32:45.564 --> 32:48.467
because I just used the cash
that I have in my purse.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.402
I found a nice place to dream.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.838
No, no, no, no. Allison.
Allison, listen to me. Listen.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.806
I love you, Joe.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.177
Whatever happens, you know that.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.479
I love you more than anything.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.182
(phone beeping off and closing)

33:04.983 --> 33:07.119
(groaning softly)

33:10.589 --> 33:12.524
(groaning)

33:34.146 --> 33:36.282
* *

33:59.371 --> 34:01.507
(Allison laughing)

34:21.993 --> 34:24.130
* *

34:47.418 --> 34:50.556
I heard about
your close call in Guadalajara.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.259
Didn't expect to see you
back in the States so soon.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.362
What can I say? I had
a very good doctor.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.929
There's an extra $20,000 here.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.598
Cabrera family.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.600
They want to make sure
you know they appreciate

35:01.600 --> 35:03.735
the level of cooperation
that you offer them.

35:05.804 --> 35:09.107
(garage door opening)

35:09.107 --> 35:10.809
What is that?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.744
The garage door.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.351
Who are you?

35:19.351 --> 35:21.220
What are you doing here?

35:21.220 --> 35:23.222
Her name's
Allison Dubois.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.625
You killed her family
a little over a year ago.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.761
Doctor's office
in Guadalajara.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.298
You went there on
your own, didn't you?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.633
You left a cell number
with the doctor.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.636
He needed to contact you to give
you the results of a blood test,

35:37.636 --> 35:39.638
see if your gunshot
wound had gone septic.

35:39.638 --> 35:44.710
The investigator I hired tracked
the cell number this address.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.578
That's how I got here.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.247
Now, what are you
doing here, Daniel?

35:51.417 --> 35:52.584
Well, I guess we know.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.085
All right,
that's enough talk.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.421
Wait a second.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.855
What's that smell?

35:56.855 --> 35:57.856
Don't worry about it.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.225
Pull the trigger.

35:59.225 --> 36:02.194
We can all go together.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.529
I cut the gas line

36:03.529 --> 36:05.831
before I closed
the garage door.

36:05.831 --> 36:10.836
I figure, by now, all it will
take is one little spark.

36:12.371 --> 36:16.174
You pull your trigger.
I'll pull mine.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.344
Any spark will do.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.612
Daniel.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.014
Explain to me
how you can take money

36:23.014 --> 36:26.285
from these people after
they did that to your wife.

36:26.285 --> 36:31.823
Oh, see? You're not so psychic.

36:33.559 --> 36:38.063
He didn't start taking money
after I killed his bride.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.165
He was taking money for years.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.167
You allowed them to murder her?

36:42.167 --> 36:44.503
She figured out
what I was doing.

36:44.503 --> 36:45.671
I didn't like it, but...

36:45.671 --> 36:49.241
Hey, the past is the past.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.844
Point is, nobody has to die now.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.113
We can all walk away.

36:55.113 --> 37:00.252
And you can walk away a very
wealthy woman, Miss Dubois.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.488
I don't want that.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.123
I don't want money.

37:05.123 --> 37:07.593
I want to see my family again.

37:07.593 --> 37:12.864
And we all know there's only
one way that I can do that now.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.936
So, what is it going to be?

37:20.138 --> 37:22.974
You're right.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.276
Ladies first.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.380
(gasping)

37:29.581 --> 37:31.717
(elevator bell dings)

37:36.221 --> 37:37.789
Agent Muñoz.

37:37.789 --> 37:38.957
You're here.

37:38.957 --> 37:39.891
Mr. District Attorney.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.093
It's awfully early in the
morning to be seeing you.

37:42.093 --> 37:42.894
Something up?

37:42.894 --> 37:44.963
Well, we just received
an anonymous tip.

37:44.963 --> 37:45.897
A citizen spotted someone

37:45.897 --> 37:47.366
matching Oswaldo
Castillo's description.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.469
Apparently, he's meeting with
two other men in a parking lot

37:50.469 --> 37:52.571
outside a check cashing
facility in Point Breeze.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.073
Right now?
We believe so.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.743
Squad cars are on the way. You
can ride with me if you'd like.

37:57.743 --> 38:01.647
Sure. Let me just stick this
in here and I'll be right down.

38:15.361 --> 38:18.830
Did you warn him?

38:18.830 --> 38:21.166
Allison, my God.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.301
I thought you were having
surgery this morning.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.636
What are you doing here?

38:24.636 --> 38:25.871
I had to put it off.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.374
I had to tell
the District Attorney about a...

38:28.374 --> 38:30.409
dream that I just had.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.644
What are you talking about?

38:32.644 --> 38:35.046
Allison, no offense,
but you look terrible.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.382
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.150
Sir! You can come in now.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.786
(door opening)

38:46.291 --> 38:48.960
What's going on? I thought we
were going after Castillo.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.596
There was no tip.
We just told you that

38:50.596 --> 38:52.598
so you would be compelled
to contact Oswaldo.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.932
May I see your
phone, please?

38:55.567 --> 38:58.336
Absolutely not. This is my
private phone. I just can't...

38:58.336 --> 39:01.907
That cop you gave up,
Luis Ruiz.

39:01.907 --> 39:06.512
He sat five feet from me
for the past three years.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.415
I know his kid.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.650
Give me that phone now
or I'll arrest you

39:11.650 --> 39:13.585
for obstruction of justice
and then I'll take it from you.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.487
This is insane.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.823
I'm a Federal Agent.
You just can't bully me.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.526
That really doesn't
matter much, Agent Muñoz.

39:20.526 --> 39:21.760
Either you give
me the phone

39:21.760 --> 39:23.161
or I go to the trouble
of getting a subpoena

39:23.161 --> 39:24.963
and getting the records
from your carrier.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.766
They'll give me every
call, every text,

39:27.766 --> 39:30.602
and as I'm sure you're
aware, all I need to do

39:30.602 --> 39:32.571
is prove that you
forwarded information

39:32.571 --> 39:35.441
about Detective Ruiz
to the Cabrera cartel.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.576
And that would make
you an accessory

39:37.576 --> 39:38.844
to the murder of
a police officer.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.847
You'd be looking at
the death penalty.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.550
Or you can give
me your phone.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.917
Tell me where Oswaldo
Castillo's hiding,

39:45.917 --> 39:48.554
and I might just be
willing to settle

39:48.554 --> 39:50.889
for putting you in jail
for the rest of your life.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.331
Okay. We did it your way.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.367
Now let's get you
to the hospital.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.969
Allison?!

40:03.969 --> 40:06.938
WOMAN (over PA):
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.207
Hey. Joe.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.509
Any news?

40:10.509 --> 40:12.878
I haven't heard a thing.
She's still in surgery.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.045
(sighing)

40:14.045 --> 40:15.581
Well, I would have
been here sooner,

40:15.581 --> 40:18.884
but your wife left me
a very busy man.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.620
Daniel Muñoz
gave us the address

40:21.620 --> 40:23.054
where Oswaldo Castillo
was hiding.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.256
We arrested him
about two hours ago.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.893
(whispering):
Oh.

40:27.893 --> 40:32.097
Joe, I know that Allison
delayed her surgery

40:32.097 --> 40:34.633
because she was afraid

40:34.633 --> 40:36.835
that the cartel posed
a threat to your family.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.639
You should know that they're
not a threat anymore.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.608
You're wife's a hero, Joe.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.776
I know that.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.379
I've always known that.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.915
Mr. Dubois.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.917
Hi.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.852
Maybe we should
speak in my office.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.187
No. What's going on.
Just...

40:56.187 --> 40:57.956
Tell me.
How's my wife?

40:57.956 --> 41:00.726
The procedure
itself went well.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.761
The tumor was benign.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.563
And we were able
to excise it

41:04.563 --> 41:06.364
almost entirely.
Okay.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.465
There was a small portion

41:07.465 --> 41:11.803
that had grown deeply into
the tissue of the brainstem.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.004
If it continues to grow,

41:13.004 --> 41:16.141
we think we'll be able to
eliminate it with radiation.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.510
That's... Okay.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.979
So, how long
before she's awake?

41:23.915 --> 41:26.518
Your wife had a stroke
shortly before surgery.

41:26.518 --> 41:30.889
The pressure in her skull,
it just got to be too much.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.324
We went ahead with
the procedure anyway.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.061
But now she is
completely non-responsive

41:36.061 --> 41:38.730
and she's showing no
signs of consciousness.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.668
And so far, we've been
unable to wake her.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.002
I'm sorry, Mr. Dubois.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.305
But until we can determine
the severity of the stroke,

41:47.305 --> 41:49.340
it is impossible to predict

41:49.340 --> 41:55.513
when or even if she will ever
come out of her comatose state.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.619
* *

42:15.366 --> 42:18.536
