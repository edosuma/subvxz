And what are your margins
on this?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.458
When we sell it,
it's about 40%.

25:26.458 --> 25:30.095
Each box costs us $12,000
to build.

25:30.095 --> 25:34.199
Most people are leasing them
for between $800-$1,000 a month.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.635
Do many of the people who lease
from you do it short term

25:36.635 --> 25:38.804
and convert
to a customer who buys?

25:38.804 --> 25:42.474
The average lease term right now
is about eight months,

25:42.474 --> 25:45.677
and about 60%
of our clients

25:45.677 --> 25:49.148
have renewed their lease,
gotten an additional box,

25:49.148 --> 25:52.518
or requested to purchase
the box that they have.

25:52.518 --> 25:56.722
To me, it seems like a clever
idea, fit with COVID perfectly,

25:56.722 --> 26:00.526
but I don't think that this is
the right investment.

26:00.526 --> 26:05.197

that I would be excited about.

Why are you trying to raise
$300,000?

26:14.173 --> 26:15.674
Why do you need
that money?

26:15.674 --> 26:18.777
Right now, our capacity
is about five boxes a month

26:18.777 --> 26:19.845
that we're doing.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.447
We need more space.

26:21.447 --> 26:24.583
We see the potential
to grow exponentially,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.152
and that's what we need
this money for.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.587
But that's a challenge,
guys, right?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.523
You're constrained
by your capital and your time

26:31.523 --> 26:33.725
and the availability
of the boxes.

26:33.725 --> 26:36.595
What I look to invest in
are hockey stick businesses,

26:36.595 --> 26:39.731
where they kind of feed on
themselves and grow themselves,

26:39.731 --> 26:42.134
and they're not necessarily
fully capital-constrained

26:42.134 --> 26:43.602
and time-constrained.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.804
It's not the right kind of
business for me to invest in,

26:45.804 --> 26:48.440
so for those reasons,
I'm out.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.245

portion of the momentum

26:53.245 --> 26:55.848
that you have
is connected to COVID.

26:55.848 --> 27:00.419
It's not clear to me that
it's not connected to COVID,

27:00.419 --> 27:05.190
and the valuation
seems to not factor that in.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.292

with this business,

due to
its capital requirements,

27:13.932 --> 27:16.635
the capital goes in,
the more successful you are,

27:16.635 --> 27:18.370
it's impossible
to get it back out.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.707
I hate doing deals
where I kiss my money goodbye

27:21.707 --> 27:23.609
and then I never see
it again.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.544
I like it where there's a way
for me to get it back,

27:25.544 --> 27:27.246
and I'm not greedy,
and I'm very creative,

27:27.246 --> 27:29.081

I'm a partner in the business,

What happens
if they lease it?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.375
-Yeah.
-Right.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.277
It's an amortized payback
on the lease.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.912
I'm getting a portion
of the lease.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.446
It's a way for me
to get my capital back,

$600,000

28:03.949 --> 28:05.617

goes to zero.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.882
Like, when I was younger,
my family and I moved to India,

34:10.882 --> 34:14.185
and we were walking to school
one day and we saw a large crowd

34:14.185 --> 34:16.321
gathered around a lady
that was crying.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.890
The little boy was laying
in his mom's arms,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.259
and he had died
from the bad <i>paanee,</i>

34:21.259 --> 34:23.428
or the bad water
that he and his family

34:23.428 --> 34:25.463
had to drink
every single day.

34:25.463 --> 34:28.800
And this image has stayed in
my head for a really long time.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.268
Later, as an engineer,

34:30.268 --> 34:32.437
I went to work
in the middle of nowhere

34:32.437 --> 34:34.773
to help drill oil wells,
and very quickly,

34:34.773 --> 34:38.109
I learned it takes weeks
and weeks to get to oil,

34:38.109 --> 34:40.478
but you hit water
within minutes.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.581
This bothered me because
there are literally people

34:42.581 --> 34:45.283
and children dying
from not having clean water

34:45.283 --> 34:49.387
when the clean water
is 100 yards beneath their feet.

34:49.387 --> 34:53.024
Around the same time, I was
shopping for engagement rings

34:53.024 --> 34:55.894
and I was really troubled
that these symbols of love

34:55.894 --> 34:58.930
came with questions of ethics,
so I thought when I proposed,

34:58.930 --> 35:00.131
what if I could do it
with a ring

35:00.131 --> 35:02.434
that didn't just not hurt
the world,

35:02.434 --> 35:04.102
but actually helped the world?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.504
How do you source
the diamonds ethically?

35:06.504 --> 35:08.506
So all of
our natural diamonds,

35:08.506 --> 35:11.610
we're only sourcing them
if we're 100% sure

35:11.610 --> 35:13.111
they're from
an ethical mine.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.615
And by that, you mean
that the labor is treated well,

35:16.615 --> 35:18.750
that the conditions of mining
are good?

35:18.750 --> 35:21.486
Correct.
Or we do lab-created diamonds.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.455
The lab-created market
is booming.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.090
Even the rings
you're seeing,

35:25.090 --> 35:26.791
they're made from recycled
precious metal,

35:26.791 --> 35:28.827
recycled gold,
recycled platinum.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.195
So how long --
how long ago was this?

35:30.195 --> 35:31.630
When did you
start the company?

35:31.630 --> 35:34.265
So I left my job in 2013.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.900
I had saved up $18,000.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.237
I put every single dollar
into starting the company.

35:39.237 --> 35:42.974
2014 was my first year
working on this full time.

we did $8.3 million in sales.

What are you gonna make
this year on the $11 million?

35:56.187 --> 35:58.657
So we've already done
$5.2 million this year

35:58.657 --> 36:01.559

Okay, and what about --
And did you make money

36:04.562 --> 36:06.398
on the $8.3 million last year?
We did.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.500
It was a little bit less
than $100,000.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.636
What do you charge for,
let's say, a 2-carat solitaire?

36:11.636 --> 36:13.972
Sure. So yours is very close
to 2 carat.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.807
It's about 2.5.
Okay, right.
