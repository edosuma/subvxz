00:02.127 --> 00:03.674
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.213 --> 00:05.339
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:09.101
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.136
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.689
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:15.774
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:17.943
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:20.612
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:22.985
Previously on Arrow...

00:23.232 --> 00:24.575
How long are you gonna be
staying here, man?

00:24.733 --> 00:27.361
I'm a fugitive, Rene. I live here.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.783
Why didn't you tell me

00:28.946 --> 00:30.948
that Kovar was making a move
against the Bratva?

00:31.114 --> 00:33.867
<i>Well, Pakhan is going to be here
any moment. He'll explain everything.</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:36.165
You're going to blow his new casino up.

00:37.579 --> 00:41.334
Hello, Oliver Queen.
My name is Konstantin Kovar.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.093
Is there something you wanna tell me?

00:43.335 --> 00:45.303
If that's code for
"are you still drinking,"

00:45.462 --> 00:48.682
<i>then my answer hasn't changed
since the last 50 times you asked me.</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:52.936
<i>Oliver, I think we have
a real lead on who Prometheus is.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:55.977
<i>He's</i> a <i>member of the SCPD.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:11.997
What's with the music?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.452
It keeps the girls mellow.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.244
She'll do. 5k.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.288
Come on, man. Look at her. Seven.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.499
Well, that's the Green Arrow.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.418
Turning off the lights.
I heard he does that.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.533
Run!

02:25.979 --> 02:29.153
Come on, hoss. Ease up.
What's gotten into you today?

02:29.483 --> 02:33.204
For the past three weeks,
I've either been living here or at HIVE.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.786
Call it cabin fever.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.951
Well, how about
you don't take it out on me?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.413
I don't even know why you're teaching us
how to use these things.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.082
What good is a wooden stick
if the other guy's got a gun?

02:45.248 --> 02:47.421
You ever heard of Slade Wilson?

02:47.584 --> 02:50.007
He could take you down
in about two seconds with a wooden stick.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.758
Actually, they're more than
just wooden sticks.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.552
They're from the Philippines,
and their technical name is...

02:59.721 --> 03:00.768
Baston.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.948
"All that most maddens and torments,

03:10.107 --> 03:13.281
"all that cracks the sinews
and cakes the brain."

03:14.528 --> 03:16.246
Rory, is that from the Torah?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.823
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

03:18.115 --> 03:20.664
Oh. Does that make me Ahab?

03:20.826 --> 03:24.046
Well, if the obsessive
and really intense look fits...

03:25.622 --> 03:27.499
Prometheus has stopped killing randoms.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.089
You'd have to be as crazy
as he is to think he's stopped.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.425
This guy's deliberate.
I mean, he has a very specific plan,

03:32.587 --> 03:35.636
and we need to find him
before he executes the next phase of it.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.184
But for now, we have a new problem,

03:41.346 --> 03:43.940
or should I say another new problem?

03:44.391 --> 03:47.895
Nathan Sierra and Pablo Estevez,
but I prefer douche bags one and two,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.187
just showed up at SCPD.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.355
Doing what?

03:50.647 --> 03:52.149
I don't know. Just hanging around.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.277
Damn.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.072
What is it with this city
and serial killers lately?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.497
Who says it's a new one?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.159
Yeah. Look at the "V" on their faces.
That's not Prometheus' M.O.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.577
Victimology doesn't fit either.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.838
Sierra and Estevez both have rap sheets
for human trafficking.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.671
SCPD thinks that these murders might
be the works of a different vigilante.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.126
How do you already know that?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.717
I have an inside man at SCPD.

04:15.172 --> 04:19.017
You mean your boyfriend,
or whatever he is. Who needs labels?

04:19.384 --> 04:23.389
So either we're dealing with Prometheus
or another multiple murderer.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.852
Either way, he has to be stopped.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.525
Uh... Does he though?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.025
Blondie's got a point.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.187
Two less scumbags on the street.
What's the downside?

04:30.479 --> 04:34.200
The downside is that we already have
one psycho loose in this city.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.368
We can't afford to have another.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.704
Who gets to decide who's a psycho
and who's a vigilante?

04:59.341 --> 05:02.811
Mr. Queen, <i>dobry den.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:07.437
I thought you might enjoy
a break in my men's questioning.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.234
I trust you'll show the proper manners.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.991
Go ahead. Go ahead.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.986
Please eat.

05:23.782 --> 05:28.583
I must confess you've become
something of a fascination with me.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.498
Oliver Queen.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.422
Starling City's favorite son.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.715
Presumed dead
after a maritime accident four years ago.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.100
What do you want from me?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.722
Answers.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.430
You tried to blow up my casino.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.775
Now my sources tell me
you've become Bratva.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.440
I have many enemies,
but you're quite unique.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.443
A week of questioning,

06:01.570 --> 06:05.291
a week of torture,
and you've told my men nothing.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.745
Except the occasional screaming
for a woman, to avenge her.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.330
What was her name?

06:12.998 --> 06:15.717
Taiana. Taiana.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.597
Mmm.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.510
Galina.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.311
Mmm.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.934
Galina.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.163
Okay.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.576
Lovely lady.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.130
I believe you knew her daughter.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.880
Taiana.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.725
Yes. Yes. She came to me.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.267
Galina came to me a year ago.

07:09.429 --> 07:14.777
She said both her children,
Taiana, Vlad, had disappeared.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.608
I said, "Do not worry.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.070
"I'll get you a job so you can get by
while you wait for them to return."

07:23.526 --> 07:25.244
And she's been here ever since.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.336
- Sorry for the wait.
- No worries.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.672
Gives me time
for this Twitter war I'm having

07:35.830 --> 07:37.753
with an investigative journalist
from Russia.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.381
What can I help you with?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.467
So formal. That's not fun.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.677
Susan, I've got
a million things to do today.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.761
Including dealing with whoever dropped
two bodies on the SCPD's doorstep?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.804
How do you know about that?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.265
I believe it's called
being good at my job.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.561
Susan, the city is still reeling
from the throwing star killings last week.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.900
I'm not looking to rile people up
if that's what you're implying.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.317
I'm not implying anything.
I'm gonna ask you nicely

08:05.902 --> 08:08.781
to please leave this alone
for the time being.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.246
Okay. Fair enough.

08:12.951 --> 08:13.998
Thank you.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.425
- Okay...
- I know being mayor's a hard job, but

08:21.042 --> 08:24.012
you look more in need
of a drink than anyone I've ever met.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.299
You know, are you really surprised?

08:27.757 --> 08:31.557
The police force is filled
with these corrupt officers,

08:31.720 --> 08:35.770
the city has not gotten over
the serial murders last week,

08:35.932 --> 08:38.434
and now there is
another psychotic in town.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.030
Yeah, that does sound like
a whole lot of suck.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.611
It just makes me wonder if what I'm doing
is having any positive effect.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.913
Tonight, McGuire's, 9:00 p.m.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.457
I'm gonna buy you
that drink you so desperately need.

08:57.454 --> 09:01.334
I appreciate that,
but I don't, uh, need a date.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.549
No, but you need a friend,
maybe even more than you need that drink.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.637
See you tonight.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.773
- Hey.
- Um..

09:22.645 --> 09:23.646
Do you have a minute?

09:24.230 --> 09:27.655
Branson's got a new poll
in the field as of last week,

09:27.817 --> 09:33.290
and our approval ratings are up
but not as much as I would like.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.493
Are you okay?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.169
No, not even close.

09:39.370 --> 09:43.750
Did you fall off the wagon?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.586
Well, to do that I'd have to be on it.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.803
You went to a meeting.
I took you there myself.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.137
And I'm sorry.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.201
Ready.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.165
Let's roll.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.671
Go! Go!

10:36.219 --> 10:38.096
- Set.
- Ready...

10:40.348 --> 10:41.895
Go! Go! Go!

10:47.272 --> 10:48.740
Guys, we have incoming!

10:56.030 --> 10:58.032
Guys! Hello!

11:02.745 --> 11:04.463
Star City National Bank
robbery in progress.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.748
We haven't had one of those in a while.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.919
Suit up.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.966
Felicity... Star City... No? Okay.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.728
Tango spotted. Cover me.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.224
- Clear.
- Clear.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.434
Clear.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.229
Overwatch, robbery's over. Suspect down.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.069
We need immediate medical attention.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.241
Vigilante.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.160
Yeah, genius. That's what we are.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.784
Vigilante did this.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.124
These guys
are definitely my favorite crooks,

11:48.291 --> 11:50.885
not that I'm condoning their actions,
just their choice in disguise.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.056
I could totally see Paul and I's
next Halloween costumes.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.466
That's almost a year from now.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.601
Okay, back to things that actually matter.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.638
The spooky crew's
been on a bit of a spree.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.896
Yeah, more than a bit.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.354
They've hit up seven banks in three states
over the past two weeks.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.642
Who's running point?

12:06.976 --> 12:10.150
Eric Dunn. It's not the first time
he's tried these scare tactics.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.066
SCPD collared him in 2011
for multiple armed robberies.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.032
He should be in Iron Heights for another
eight years trading cigarettes.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.787
- So how'd he get out?
- Parole.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.323
Our justice system at work.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.994
Dunn must have formed a new crew.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.082
So Dunn and this new crew hit the bank,
but Vigilante got there before you did.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.872
Yeah, looks like he and his crew booked.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.839
The guy they left in the bank,
however, did not make it.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.877
The bank's CCTV coverage
got a glimpse at our new friend.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.508
Okay, we are fighting a war on two fronts.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.675
At least.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.468
So we're stopping other vigilantes now?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.015
I think what Evelyn's suggesting

12:42.178 --> 12:44.897
is we're on the same side
as this Vigilante fella.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.228
Really?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.146
Because last week, all of you were pissed

12:48.309 --> 12:51.358
when you found out that The Hood
used to play judge, jury, and executioner.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.563
We can't have this both ways.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.698
We're gonna find Dunn,
we're gonna find Vigilante

12:54.857 --> 12:57.952
before any more banks get knocked over
or people get killed.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.161
You don't believe me.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.710
I believe Taiana.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.709
She said you were a monster.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.090
World is a complex place.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.724
Who's to say who is the monster,
and who is the hero?

13:21.509 --> 13:22.806
For example...

13:34.772 --> 13:37.776
How does an American
become this Bratva devil?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.117
<i>KOVAR". Recognize this man?</i>

13:42.947 --> 13:44.073
Never seen him before.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.413
Except in jail

13:47.994 --> 13:51.248
where you snapped his neck
because the Bratva told you to do it,

13:51.706 --> 13:53.253
because they told you
it would help to get to me.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.421
A convenient lie
so they could steal his business.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.928
And you killed this man,

14:01.466 --> 14:03.434
and you gave the IP address

14:04.052 --> 14:07.101
of a black market site
on the dark web to the Bratva.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.940
It's a site the Bratva now controls,

14:15.730 --> 14:17.528
like how they control you.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.325
Good, evil, hero, monster.

14:23.905 --> 14:28.035
My friend, truth is a matter
of perspective.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.085
No more games.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.250
You are gonna get me out of here.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.836
You're late.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.930
You didn't even know I was coming.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.807
I dropped a resignation letter
on your desk.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.718
You didn't think I'd expect you to show up
and try and talk me out of it?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.353
And you can't, by the way.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.311
And what makes you think
that I even want to, huh?

14:50.807 --> 14:54.107
You lied to us, Quentin, repeatedly.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.896
So what are you doing here then?

14:56.604 --> 14:57.651
Look, you“.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.531
You are like family to us, okay?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.821
And I'm worried about you.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.744
Well, I'm not sure I deserve your worry.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.582
Yeah, neither am I, but I...

15:10.576 --> 15:13.671
lam still here, aren't I?

15:15.206 --> 15:17.174
Yeah, but that's not what I mean.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.755
Listen, when I drink like this,

15:23.172 --> 15:25.049
I black out,

15:25.216 --> 15:26.468
I lose time,

15:26.634 --> 15:28.011
and it's been happening a lot lately.

15:29.804 --> 15:34.856
And last week, I woke up,
and I had blood on my hands and...

15:39.856 --> 15:40.857
And this.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.750
Uh, sorry, pal. We're just closing up.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.707
Really? I was hoping
you could help me out.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.042
It's kind of an emergency.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.502
"Emergency"?

15:56.914 --> 15:59.087
I'm going duck hunting tomorrow,
and I'm totally out of ammo.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.843
Friend of mine said
that you might have the kind I need?

16:01.002 --> 16:03.346
5.56-mil armor-piercing hollow points?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.053
Big bullets for ducks.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.056
Anyways, I'm closing up, so if you, uh...

16:11.679 --> 16:13.681
Dude said it was an emergency, yo.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.063
This is a nice shop.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.646
Heard you're the only guy in town
selling 5.56-mil hollow points.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.064
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.614
Hey!

16:22.940 --> 16:26.160
Every week, you get a shipment
of 5.56-mil hollow points.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.320
You sell to one customer!

16:27.487 --> 16:28.488
Hey, we had this handled.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.701
I want a name!

16:29.864 --> 16:32.583
I don't know who he is.
I haven't even seen his face.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.079
He's always got the mask on.
Scary as hell, man.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.246
Worse than you.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.931
Hey, baby. Where you goin'?
My house is the other way.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.174
Huh?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.598
I said you're going the wrong way.
Oh, baby, don't be like that.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.482
What's the matter, baby?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.779
He's not a ghost.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.316
We have a few questions for you.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.912
What the hell was that?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.294
I thought I was supposed
to be the wild animal.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.500
Wild Dog.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.252
You totally lost it on that guy.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.212
Hey, listen, if I lose it, you'll know it.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.470
Rene's right. You were kind of unhinged,
which isn't your style.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.096
- What's up?
- Nothing, man, forget about it.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.177
Try us. We're empathetic.
Well, one of us.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.442
Today's my son's second birthday.
I missed the party.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.900
It's not because I've been
chasing down vigilantes either.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.738
It's because the US Marshals
have my home under surveillance.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.444
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.825
Feel stupid even talking about this, man.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.038
It's not like J.J. will ever have
another second birthday,

17:57.118 --> 17:59.041
it's not like I'll ever stop
being a fugitive.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.794
Tell us where to find Dunn.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.800
Please. I don't know
what Eric's been up to.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.344
I lost touch with him when he went inside.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.926
Sorry. My friend and I don't believe you.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.431
How far could you throw him?

18:15.678 --> 18:18.272
Oh, it depends on how many bones
you want broken.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.734
Eric Dunn's out of prison
and robbing banks again.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.441
Give us a line on him,
and we'll go harass him instead of you.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.655
I told you. I haven't seen him in a while.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.320
Three bones. Better yet, make it four.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.530
But I know how he operates.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.993
He picks banks based on
proximity to police stations.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.207
Furthest first and works his way inwards.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.044
It shouldn't take you too long to figure
out which place his crew will hit next.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.799
Please.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.550
Hurry, hurry!

18:51.005 --> 18:52.552
We got a minute or two
before the blues get here.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.467
It's not them I'm worried about.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.011
Hey!

19:03.726 --> 19:04.727
Get down!

19:06.437 --> 19:07.905
You're right to worry.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.144
I'm not here for you.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.855
Then stop trying to kill us!

19:44.975 --> 19:45.976
Dunn.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.271
I'm going after him.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.512
Hey! Keep your guns down.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.975
So then you can just shoot me?
We're on the same side.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.510
You're out of control.

20:19.218 --> 20:24.566
This city is out of control,
and you haven't been able to save it.

20:26.142 --> 20:30.693
Take one more step,
and one of you isn't going home tonight.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.823
If you're not with me,
then you're against me.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.203
Then I'm against you.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.990
Then you're a dead man.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.371
I think we scared him off.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.507
He'll be back.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.918
Kind of reminds me of you,
don't you think?

20:58.924 --> 21:02.428
- Where are we?
- We got two bags of bones in ACU custody.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.847
- And Dunn?
- In the wind.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.390
The recruits are still out
looking for him.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.895
Send them home. It's been a long night.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.856
If we don't find Dunn
before Vigilante does, he's a dead man.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.238
Look, you said that I inspired
this new wave of vigilantes,

21:13.397 --> 21:14.774
but I don't think that's true.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.410
I think that Vigilante
is out there right now

21:17.568 --> 21:19.366
because we haven't been getting
the job done.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.872
It's been four years,
and things have only gotten worse.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.704
Oliver, you saved this city
10 times over.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.038
At least.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.919
And I've been trying
to be a legitimate hero,

21:27.077 --> 21:29.705
which means that I lean on the courts
and the justice system.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.545
The fact that someone like Eric Dunn

21:31.707 --> 21:33.209
is out there right now
should tell us something.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.467
Like what?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.595
Maybe none of it's working.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.726
Twitch and I will open your throat.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.187
Now you tell your men
to put their guns down.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.107
Do it!

21:55.940 --> 21:58.739
All right. Let's go.
Come on. Move!

22:02.780 --> 22:06.705
Go. Go.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.081
I need a vehicle.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.747
Mr. Queen, think about what you are doing.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.007
I know exactly what I am doing.
Keep moving!

22:13.165 --> 22:15.793
And your partner will be very displeased
by this course of action.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.255
Oh, really?
Tell me, does his mom work here, too?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.340
Actually, we've reached an accord.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.433
The Bratva will lay off hostilities

22:23.759 --> 22:26.888
as exchange for a percentage
of my casino's profits.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.102
Your first two lies were more believable.

22:29.515 --> 22:33.065
I told you,
truth is a matter of perspective.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.480
Ask yourself which is more likely,

22:35.646 --> 22:39.571
that the Bratva will let an American
into their brotherhood?

22:39.859 --> 22:44.410
Or that they're using you
for whatever little value you can provide?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.368
Or option three.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.130
You're too weak
to know the difference.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.337
Okay, so tell me what happened again.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.346
We've been over this 100 times already.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.349
Okay, so you must be getting really good
at telling it then.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.974
Okay, the last few weeks,
I've been blacking out.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.975
Last week, I woke up with, uh...
I don't know, all bloody,

23:12.141 --> 23:14.064
and my arm's cut with that.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.149
So I had a friend on the force run
forensics on it,

23:16.312 --> 23:17.814
and it turns out that
that thing is consistent

23:17.980 --> 23:20.324
with the Throwing Star Killer
and his victims.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.619
Okay, so... So, what? You...

23:24.153 --> 23:28.033
You think you're him, you're that guy?
I mean...

23:28.365 --> 23:29.992
I don't know what to think anymore, Thea.

23:31.660 --> 23:36.291
But, no, I don't think even my drinking
could turn me into a psychopath.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.793
So why did you even resign then?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.220
Because I lied to you

23:41.921 --> 23:43.764
about going to the meetings, the drinking.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.345
And now, this psycho, whoever he is,

23:48.594 --> 23:50.346
he's messing with me.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.355
He's targeting me.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.977
I'm damaged goods, Thea.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.156
I shouldn't be anywhere near close to you

24:02.024 --> 24:03.196
or the mayor of our city.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.539
This is a nice mask.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.542
Do you prefer Bonesy,
or can I call you Laura?

24:17.206 --> 24:18.253
Go to hell.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.463
Okay, Laura it is then.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.174
So, Laura,

24:23.837 --> 24:26.215
it actually turns out that
I'm a lot more interested

24:26.382 --> 24:27.975
in Eric Dunn than I am in you,

24:28.133 --> 24:30.511
which makes this your lucky day. So...

24:32.638 --> 24:34.982
Come on.
How about you just tell me where Eric is,

24:35.140 --> 24:36.892
and I'll let you walk out of here.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.359
I said, "Go to hell."

24:43.399 --> 24:46.653
What? Do you need directions or somethin'?

24:48.112 --> 24:49.238
No.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.450
I've been to hell,

24:54.535 --> 24:59.917
and that makes me somebody
that you do not want to screw with.

25:07.548 --> 25:08.765
Try the Papp Motel.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.316
That was impressive.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.103
It got results at least.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.732
I'm gonna reach out to Judge Balderrama,
get a warrant to move on the Papp Motel.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.533
Should take about an hour, maybe two.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.445
Quick as you can. I don't think
this Vigilante waits on warrants.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.869
No, I bet he doesn't.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.147
Do not reach for that gun.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.814
I'm already dead.
The other masked crazy has me marked.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.527
You know what's funny?

26:03.312 --> 26:06.407
<i>The first time I got arrested,
I wasn't even guilty.</i>

26:07.149 --> 26:11.655
They got the wrong guy,
but the D.A., they didn't care.

26:12.154 --> 26:13.781
<i>They had to pin the crime on someone.</i>

26:14.156 --> 26:15.624
I was a good kid.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.495
I spent two years in Iron Heights.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.293
I wasn't a good kid after that.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.199
Door! Now!

27:03.497 --> 27:06.171
<i>When Star City firefighters
responded late tonight,</i>

27:06.333 --> 27:10.383
<i>they found three as yet to be identified
victims dead inside the adjacent...</i>

27:10.546 --> 27:13.095
Anyone still think that Vigilante
doesn't need to be stopped?

27:13.257 --> 27:15.225
To be fair,
the story Dunn laid out is legit.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.604
His conviction in '07 could be the basis
for <i>Making</i> a Murderer Season 2.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.184
Eric Dunn
might not be a choir boy,

27:20.347 --> 27:21.724
but he doesn't deserve a death sentence.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.104
Point made.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.315
The question being,
how do we stop Vigilante?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.024
Better yet, how do we find him?

27:27.271 --> 27:28.898
Well, we have Dunn
in protective custody downstairs.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.737
I guess we can't just leave him
hog-tied on Main Street

27:30.899 --> 27:32.401
and then wait for Ski Goggles to show up.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.036
Let's assume that's not Plan A.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.409
We work the problem.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.119
All right. I have to go see someone.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.454
At this time of night?

27:39.616 --> 27:40.913
Who are you meeting?
'Cause we're all here.

27:42.870 --> 27:48.297
I'm meeting Susan Williams
at a bar for mayor's office stuff.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.254
"Mayor's office"? Sounds like a date.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.757
If you get anything new, please call me.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.933
He's totally going on a date.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.177
Yep.

28:02.764 --> 28:06.109
All right. So we're here. Where's here?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.987
It's a place called New Oasis.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.944
- Rehab?
- You need it, Quentin.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.108
I don't think so, not with everything
that's going on right now.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.199
- It's just not the time.
- This is exactly the right time,

28:16.361 --> 28:18.989
and you know it.
Everything has just been an excuse

28:19.156 --> 28:22.205
keeping you away
from feeling what you need to.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.495
I suppose you're gonna tell me
exactly what that is.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.417
I don't have to.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.511
Laurel.

28:37.591 --> 28:41.346
I know you think that you have dealt
with your grief on this

28:42.679 --> 28:45.649
but all of this drinking
is saying otherwise.

28:45.974 --> 28:50.150
It just hurts, you know? It just hurts
so much. It just hurts so much.

28:50.479 --> 28:54.359
I know. I know. I know.

28:54.942 --> 28:58.947
And the worst thing is knowing
how ashamed she'd be of me right now.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.123
She wouldn't be ashamed of you, Quentin.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.375
She would be concerned, okay?
Just like I am.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.677
You know,
I used to get shot at for a living.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.337
I don't know what it is
about this building

29:15.504 --> 29:17.472
that's got me so scared.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.597
We're afraid of things we don't know,

29:22.261 --> 29:26.482
especially when we've been living
in pain this long.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.111
It's hard to even accept
the idea of being happy.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.488
Yeah.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.159
When'd you become so wise, huh?

29:37.776 --> 29:42.498
I've been through a lot,
in the last four years.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.370
Yeah.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.870
Your mother would be proud of you.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.091
Why don't you go in there
and make Laurel proud of you?

29:53.375 --> 29:54.718
What about being deputy mayor?

29:55.210 --> 29:58.384
It will be waiting for you
right when you get back.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.715
I promise.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.555
Thanks.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.514
For everything.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.899
Thank me by getting better.

30:38.420 --> 30:41.720
That's what you get
for leaving the corner pocket open, pal.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.258
Good game.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.225
- Hi.
- Ah, you are here.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.851
You play pool?

30:49.431 --> 30:52.981
Well, if by "play" you mean "win,"
then yeah.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.734
- One drink as promised.
- Oh.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.489
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.028
Oh.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.082
Okay, the friend part...

31:07.949 --> 31:09.075
Try me.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.796
I'd say that this is off the record,
but I'm pretty sure it's public knowledge.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.331
- Um...
- Okay.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.754
This job...

31:18.627 --> 31:22.222
This job has proven to be a little bit
more difficult than I expected.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.514
What's occasioning
the dark night of the soul?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.388
It's tough to explain.

31:30.722 --> 31:34.568
Let's say, that there
was someone else in my position,

31:35.977 --> 31:37.854
but they were more extreme than I am.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.986
And you don't want to go there.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.320
I don't want to go there.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.734
Okay.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.327
But they've gone there,

31:45.237 --> 31:49.367
which makes me question
if what I'm doing is actually effective.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.377
I'm trying to come at things differently.

31:52.536 --> 31:56.166
I'm trying to be more optimistic, for me.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.668
Nah, but it just feels like...

31:59.835 --> 32:02.714
It's one step forward, two steps back?

32:03.171 --> 32:04.263
That's it.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.551
I think that's what's called
"being in charge."

32:09.177 --> 32:11.600
Look, the truth is,
you're all this city has.

32:12.848 --> 32:17.854
So, however you go about your business,
just keep doing it the right way.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.481
Even if it takes longer
to get the job done,

32:20.647 --> 32:23.617
you'll know, and so will the city.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.576
Will they?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.116
Really.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.579
So, stop being so hard on yourself.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.464
Technically, that is your job.

32:38.665 --> 32:39.837
Damn right.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.391
You work very late hours, Mr. Queen.

32:48.550 --> 32:52.555
You've no idea,
and, Susan, call me Oliver.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.567
Hey. We can't find Vigilante,

32:57.726 --> 32:59.728
but I think we figured out a way
to draw him out.

32:59.895 --> 33:00.942
Talk to me.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.739
How do you feel about us robbing a bank?

33:21.875 --> 33:22.967
God, it's so hot in that mask!

33:24.252 --> 33:26.095
- I'm used to it.
- Security cameras.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.927
<i>- I'm on it.
- Maybe I wasn't paying attention</i>

33:28.089 --> 33:29.682
during the briefing,
but isn't the point to get caught?

33:29.841 --> 33:30.842
Yeah, not by the cops.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.553
That's why I'm only cutting lines to SCPD.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.392
You two take the safe upstairs.
I'll cover Felicity.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.602
Okay, isn't that taking
the method acting a little far?

33:36.765 --> 33:37.891
We have to make this look legit.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.605
I can't wait to explain
that at my arraignment.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.442
Terrific, Artemis, we're on the move.
Anything going on outside?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.696
Negative. All quiet out here.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.337
This was easy.
Maybe we're in the wrong line of work.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.679
You had to say it was easy.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.637
Call your boss.
We need to have a chat.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.592
- Don't listen to him!
- Shut up!

34:16.388 --> 34:18.186
Call him. Do it now.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.983
They don't have to. I'm right here.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.940
Tell your friends to beat it.
This is between us.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.741
Do it, or I'll waste him and then you.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.460
Go. I've got this.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.917
There was a girl outside.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.340
She's still breathing.
She'll wake up with a headache, though.

34:48.628 --> 34:49.971
What do you want?

34:50.170 --> 34:52.172
To operate without interference.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.804
- So you can keep killing people?
- Criminals.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.686
Like the people at the motel?

34:56.886 --> 34:58.684
Collateral damage.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.399
You don't seem to know that this is a war.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.644
Maybe that's why you're losing.

35:04.853 --> 35:05.854
<i>We have to move!</i>

35:06.021 --> 35:07.398
We can't just leave him there
with that nut job!

35:07.564 --> 35:09.692
The guy's got a gun right
to Curtis' head, Blondie.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.201
But there's no way
we can be faster than a bullet.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.993
What is he doing just standing there?

35:15.363 --> 35:16.364
Don't worry. He's got this.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.208
You got a lot of faith, man.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.418
- Green Arrow...
- Shut up!

35:22.621 --> 35:24.544
You're not getting the job done

35:24.706 --> 35:26.583
because you don't take it
seriously enough,

35:28.084 --> 35:31.213
maybe because you haven't lost anyone.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.726
You don't have a full understanding
of what's out there.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.355
Oh, I've lost people,
almost more than I can bear.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.983
Then it hasn't been
more than you can bear.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.818
Maybe you need a push!

36:26.810 --> 36:28.027
You're right.

36:28.561 --> 36:32.156
This is a war,
but I'm gonna fight it the right way

36:34.234 --> 36:36.202
because I am all this city has.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.172
Curtis!

36:51.167 --> 36:52.214
Come on.

36:55.839 --> 36:59.969
In the field, I prefer Mr. Terrific,
if you don't mind.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.304
Where's Ski Goggles?

37:03.805 --> 37:04.931
Gone.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.290
Hey. Heard about the Vigilante.
I'm sorry he got away.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.001
He will be back, and I'll get him.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.791
You always do.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.297
But, uh, I...

37:34.002 --> 37:35.879
- I need to talk to you about Quentin.
- Okay.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.511
He found this in his apartment last week.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.762
Somebody is going
through a lot of trouble

37:43.928 --> 37:46.226
to make it look like
he's behind the throwing star killings.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.351
Why would Quentin believe that?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.687
Because he's been blacking out.

37:53.772 --> 37:58.528
Look, he's in a rehab.
He's just taking some time.

37:59.360 --> 38:04.457
But I've been wondering why would
somebody be targeting him, and...

38:05.533 --> 38:06.750
The only thing I can think of...

38:07.243 --> 38:09.371
What if Prometheus
knows I'm the Green Arrow?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.881
I've killed men for less than this.

38:21.382 --> 38:25.307
So try, or are you gonna turn down
a challenge in front of your men?

38:26.471 --> 38:28.894
Maybe that means
you're too weak to know the difference.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.728
You will not interfere.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.431
What madness is this, huh?
Kovar, we had a deal.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.594
Your man did not believe me.
I was trying to convince him.

39:06.719 --> 39:10.144
If he dies, it's coming out of your cut.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.736
You believe me now, Mr. Queen?

39:15.311 --> 39:17.780
Your precious Bratva
and I have made a deal.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.278
Truth

39:21.192 --> 39:24.571
is a matter of perspective.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.926
Jeez! Do you ever not work out?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.097
I have a few things
to get off my chest, remember?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.472
I do, but I got a better solution.

39:55.977 --> 39:59.857
Little man, look at you! Come here.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.190
Oh.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.658
How are you doing?

40:02.817 --> 40:04.911
- Am I sweaty? What do you say?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.821
- You're sweaty.
- I'm what?

40:06.988 --> 40:08.205
You're sweaty.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.662
Yes, I am a little sweaty.
Did you plan this?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.957
You couldn't make it to the party, so...

40:13.119 --> 40:14.996
We could bring the party to you.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.335
What about the US Marshals?

40:16.497 --> 40:20.047
We did three SDRs.
Marshals are halfway to Hub City by now.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.961
Hey, you want some cake?

40:22.128 --> 40:23.175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.510
- Go get some cake.
- Let's get some cake.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.549
Hey, you. I love you.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.976
Go get some cake, man.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.353
Thanks for doing this, brother.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.022
What are friends for?

40:44.525 --> 40:45.572
<i>Hey, come here. Come here.</i>

40:51.616 --> 40:53.493
Fellas, can you give us a minute, please?

40:55.203 --> 40:56.500
I was just headed out for the night.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.206
I know.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.880
I, uh, may or may not
have had one of the guys

41:02.043 --> 41:04.216
on your detail text me
when you were headed out.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.848
Wow.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.225
Thank you for the other night.
That was, um...

41:14.931 --> 41:17.935
That was some good advice
and a good drink.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.233
Well, now you owe me the drink.

41:24.774 --> 41:25.946
Should we go now?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.620
- Really?
- Let's go.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.722
Don't worry. Nobody followed me.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.597
They don't suspect a thing.
