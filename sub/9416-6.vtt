00:03.333 --> 00:04.375
Hey, Mom,

00:04.458 --> 00:06.625
loving this new post on your Mommy Blog.

00:06.709 --> 00:08.458
- Oh, thanks, Sweetie.
- Yeah.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.667
According to this,

00:09.750 --> 00:11.625
"Every morning at the breakfast table,

00:11.709 --> 00:15.083
the Duncan family takes turns
saying what we're grateful for."

00:16.875 --> 00:17.875
One problem...

00:17.959 --> 00:19.125
We don't do that.

00:20.709 --> 00:21.667
Well,

00:21.750 --> 00:23.166
maybe we should, right?

00:23.250 --> 00:24.083
That way,

00:24.166 --> 00:25.834
one thing that I write about is truthful.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.834
I'll go first. I'm grateful
Gabe's still asleep.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.667
Might be some Circle O's left.

00:34.542 --> 00:36.667
"We need more Circle O's. Gabe".

00:38.375 --> 00:40.542
Okay, Charlie, what
are you thankful for?

00:40.625 --> 00:43.083
That Toby's gonna live with grandma.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.166
Yeah, honey, he's not.

00:46.417 --> 00:47.458
Nuts!

00:48.250 --> 00:50.875
- Okay, Bob, your turn.
- Ah.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.542
Do we have to do this every morning?

00:53.625 --> 00:55.792
- No.
- Well then, I'm thankful for that.

00:57.709 --> 01:01.125
Okay, if no one else is gonna
take this seriously then I will.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.041
I'm thankful for

01:03.542 --> 01:04.750
good health,

01:04.834 --> 01:06.083
family...

01:06.166 --> 01:08.166
- and food on this table.
- Aww.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.583
"We also need milk. Gabe".

Ivy, look at this note.
I just found it on my windshield.

02:16.458 --> 02:17.750
Is it about the way you park?

02:17.875 --> 02:19.875
'Cause I've been thinking about
leaving you a note myself.

02:20.542 --> 02:21.417
No.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.333
It says, "watch your back".

02:23.750 --> 02:25.709
It still could be about the way you park.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.792
You know, those white lines
are not a suggestion.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.583
Ivy, I think someone is threatening me.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.041
Oh, T, relax.

02:35.417 --> 02:37.709
It's probably nothing.
I wouldn't even worry about it.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.208
"You have been warned".

02:51.166 --> 02:52.625
Someone is out to get you.

02:53.667 --> 02:54.917
Are you backing away from me?

02:55.333 --> 02:57.041
Nope, just being supportive
from a distance.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.458
- Amy: Well, thanks for coming.
- Oh.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.834
Bye, Debbie, bye, Deedee.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.583
Debbie: Bye, Amy, bye, Charlie.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.542
Okay.

03:12.458 --> 03:16.333
All right, Charlie, little Princess,
sweetheart, please clean up your toys.

03:16.417 --> 03:17.291
No!

03:17.375 --> 03:18.709
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

03:18.792 --> 03:20.291
You can't tell me what to do.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.250
Wha...

03:21.333 --> 03:23.458
You pick up your toys
right now, young lady.

03:23.542 --> 03:24.834
No. You're not the boss of me.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.417
Well...

03:29.458 --> 03:30.875
Did you hear what she just said?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.333
She just looked me in the eye
and said "you're not the boss of me".

03:34.417 --> 03:35.625
What?

03:35.709 --> 03:38.125
Honey, everybody knows
you're the boss of everybody.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.375
You know what? She acted up last week
after her playdate with Deedee.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Oh...

03:46.083 --> 03:48.583
That's where she's getting it from.
That kid has problems.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.417
I'm gonna need to talk with Debbie.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you sure
that's the best idea?

03:53.458 --> 03:55.000
Yes. Honey, it will be fine.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.208
I will simply sit her down and explain
that Deedee has some behavioral problems

03:58.291 --> 03:59.542
she needs to address.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.709
Yeah.

04:00.792 --> 04:03.959
People love getting unsolicited advice
on how to raise their kids.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.250
I know, right?

04:13.583 --> 04:14.375
Gabe!

04:15.375 --> 04:16.583
What are you doing here?

04:16.667 --> 04:17.750
I was just thinking, we...

04:18.583 --> 04:19.917
we don't ever hang out.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.125
We did spend 13 years
in the same room together.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.792
Yeah, but did we ever really talk?

04:29.083 --> 04:30.417
So what do you wanna do?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.917
You know, what brothers do...

04:33.375 --> 04:34.583
Watch some TV,

04:35.375 --> 04:37.542
play some video games...
Oh, check the mail.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.583
I already checked the mail today,

04:40.667 --> 04:42.041
and there was something weird in it.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.875
A letter from the Hamilton Middle School

04:45.000 --> 04:46.750
addressed to the parents of Gabe Duncan?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:49.917 --> 04:50.959
You wanna tell me about this?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.375
It's, uh, it's a citizenship award.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.000
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.500
I had them send it here, I didn't want
mom and dad to make a fuss.

04:57.583 --> 04:58.458
Hmm.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.542
Gabe, I may be the dumb brother
who gets everything wrong,

05:03.625 --> 05:04.792
but I think you're lying here.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.709
Unless you're not
and I'm getting this wrong too.

05:10.250 --> 05:13.500
No, you're right. That's my report card.
And it's not very good.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.166
What happened?

05:15.291 --> 05:16.583
I'm in middle school now.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.583
The girls got prettier
and the grades got uglier.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.375
Ooh!

05:21.667 --> 05:24.709
I changed my address with the school
so all the stuff would be sent here.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.667
Told them you were my legal guardian.

05:28.709 --> 05:29.583
Wow!

05:30.792 --> 05:32.750
That's a huge honor.
I don't know what to say.

05:32.834 --> 05:37.500
It's not an honor at all, it's a trick.

05:37.625 --> 05:42.417
It's still an honor to be part
of the trick.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.625
Okay, I just have to sign
your name to this.

05:45.709 --> 05:46.792
Shouldn't I do it?

05:46.875 --> 05:48.625
Oh no, this isn't the
first thing you've signed.

05:52.875 --> 05:53.750
Wow,

05:53.834 --> 05:55.041
I've got a great signature.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.083
Oh look at that, on the tail
of the "N" you put a little heart.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.250
Yeah, it seemed like you.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.458
Thanks for coming over, Debbie.

06:06.542 --> 06:09.041
I'm actually glad you called.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.625
There's something I've been wanting
to discuss with you...

06:12.333 --> 06:13.417
About Charlie.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.667
About Charlie?

06:14.750 --> 06:15.625
Yeah.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.959
Every time my Deedee comes home
from a play date with your Charlie...

06:19.041 --> 06:20.625
She has got a 'tude.

06:23.834 --> 06:27.166
And the Dooley house is a 'tude-free zone.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.166
Wait a minute.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.667
You think Charlie's the problem.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.333
Oh, no, no, no. Deedee's the problem.

06:36.083 --> 06:39.041
Yeah. That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:39.125 --> 06:43.542
Well, it seems convenient you came
up with that right after I said it.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.417
I didn't just come up with it.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.166
I was just talking to my husband
the other day

06:48.250 --> 06:50.000
about how we were gonna have this talk.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.333
Bob, honey, could you come down here?

06:53.375 --> 06:54.917
- He's at work.
- Oh.

06:55.834 --> 06:56.667
Again,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.458
convenient.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.917
"You're not the boss of me!" Hmm?

07:04.125 --> 07:05.542
Charlie had to get that from someone...

07:05.959 --> 07:07.500
as in Deedee.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.875
Deedee got it from Charlie.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.667
And where Charlie got it from, well...

07:13.208 --> 07:15.417
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.208
- Did you just call me a tree?
- Oh, you betcha.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.375
Well,

07:29.458 --> 07:32.208
if I'm an apple tree, you are...

07:33.041 --> 07:34.625
a lemon tree!

07:35.375 --> 07:37.375
Yes, you are a lemon tree.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.458
You are nice on the outside
and sour on the inside.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.000
That would be the fruit, not the tree.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.834
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

07:48.333 --> 07:52.583
Yes yes, the Duncan house is now
a Dooley-free zone.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.583
Well,

07:56.667 --> 07:58.875
now you sound more like a crabapple.

07:59.333 --> 08:02.417
Ooh, well, you sound like a...

08:02.500 --> 08:04.083
Like a...

08:05.542 --> 08:08.834
Whoa, these fruit-tree
insults are hard to come by.

08:15.375 --> 08:20.250
So, I was doing my homework at lunch,
and the equation was two pi, r-squared.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.375
Then I dropped my apple pie, and
it became two apple pie, r-squared.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.458
Teddy, what's wrong?

08:31.542 --> 08:32.792
You always laugh at my Math jokes.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.750
I guess I'm a little out of it.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.792
Somebody at school is out to get me.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.458
Wow. That's the motto of the Chess Club.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.583
The motto of the Chess Club is
"someone at school is out to get me"?

08:47.333 --> 08:48.750
It sounds better in Latin.

08:50.750 --> 08:54.208
So, someone left a note on my
windshield that said "watch your back".

08:54.458 --> 08:57.750
Then I got a bunch of dead flowers,
and then today...

08:58.250 --> 08:59.834
someone put this in my bag!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.625
Who would do something like this?

09:03.166 --> 09:04.375
I don't know.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.792
I have no idea. How would I know?

09:06.375 --> 09:07.375
Well, gotta go.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.500
Wait a minute. You know something.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.959
I know almost everything,
but nothing about this.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.792
Victor, you are a terrible liar.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.417
Now, I want you to look me in the eyes

09:16.500 --> 09:18.417
and tell me you don't know
anything about this.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.083
I don't know anything about this.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.250
That's my chin.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.208
- I don't know anything about this.
- That's my forehead.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.959
I don't know--

09:27.041 --> 09:29.959
Victor, look me in the eye!
It's right above my nose!

09:30.041 --> 09:31.208
Don't yell at me!

09:31.291 --> 09:33.125
When people yell at me, I tend to...

09:37.625 --> 09:39.959
Someday he's gonna come
over here and not faint.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.583
But today is not that day.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.917
Victor, come on, who's out to get me?

09:53.333 --> 09:54.875
It's my girlfriend Victoria.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.709
Victoria? Why?

09:57.041 --> 09:58.500
She thinks you're in love with me.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.083
What? Why would she think that?

10:01.166 --> 10:03.917
Well, because I told her
you were in love with me.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.500
Excuse me?

10:06.041 --> 10:09.000
The other night Victoria and I
were having a fun night,

10:09.625 --> 10:11.083
doing what young couples do...

10:11.166 --> 10:12.792
Quizzing each other on state birds...

10:14.709 --> 10:17.000
when I sensed her interest in me waning.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.542
I had to do something
to re-kindle her passion.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.625
So, to make her jealous, I told
her you were in love with me.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.125
Oh, Victor!

10:24.208 --> 10:25.458
Well hey, it worked.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.333
She's fighting for her territory.

10:27.750 --> 10:28.959
And I'm her territory.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.917
I've never been someone's territory!

10:32.417 --> 10:34.375
Victor, you're going to
have to tell her the truth.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.834
The truth has no part in our relationship!

10:38.333 --> 10:40.375
Okay fine, I'll figure something out.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.250
On one condition...

10:42.583 --> 10:45.792
You do our entire science
project by yourself.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.041
Deal.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.041
Boy, that was easy.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.458
Oh, Teddy,

10:52.917 --> 10:54.250
it was gonna happen that way anyway.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.250
Bob: Hey.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.583
Hello.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.625
I thought I'd take the kids to the park.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.709
- Oh great, that sounds like fun.
- Can Deedee come?

11:07.792 --> 11:08.834
No.

11:09.875 --> 11:10.917
Why not?

11:11.000 --> 11:15.667
Because Deedee's mommy said
some very mean things about your mommy.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.792
Did Charlie's mommy...

11:19.250 --> 11:21.375
fire back with some
choice words of her own?

11:23.417 --> 11:24.625
Charlie's mommy defended herself.

11:26.709 --> 11:30.083
Charlie's daddy said the whole idea
of talking to Deedee's mommy

11:30.166 --> 11:31.834
was a bad idea to begin with.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.500
Is Charlie's daddy saying "I told you so"?

11:36.583 --> 11:37.542
Are you kidding?

11:37.625 --> 11:40.709
Does Charlie's mommy know how long
Charlie's daddy's been married to her?

11:47.750 --> 11:48.625
PJ,

11:49.417 --> 11:50.500
we have a problem.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.000
Oh, nothing you and your legal guardian
can't handle.

11:53.834 --> 11:55.917
Have a seat, little buddy,
let's hash this out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.750
You're not really my guardian.
It is just pretend!

12:00.000 --> 12:01.959
Gabe, you've been my
brother for a long time now.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.542
You should know I take pretend
very seriously.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.458
My counselor wants to come over
and talk to you about my grades.

12:08.542 --> 12:09.917
Great.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.625
I've been working on my Swedish accent.

12:13.709 --> 12:14.625
What?

12:14.709 --> 12:17.458
Yeah, I've been thinking about
this legal guardian...

12:17.542 --> 12:20.917
and I see him as someone who
spent some time in Sweden.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.542
PJ,

12:23.917 --> 12:25.041
it's Mr. Rose.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.208
He knows you! He was your counselor too.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.709
Okay, how about this, what if...

12:30.750 --> 12:34.375
I moved to Sweden right after high school,
picked up the accent,

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
and now I can't shake it?

12:36.917 --> 12:37.959
No.

12:38.041 --> 12:39.166
No Swedish accent.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.917
Well, then why did I learn how to make
Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte ?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.208
Victoria, we need to talk.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.750
Okay.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.000
You win.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.000
It's over.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.875
- Is that what you wanted to hear?
- What are you talking about?

13:01.959 --> 13:03.000
Victor.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.667
The finest specimen of manhood
to ever walk the halls of South High.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.375
And sadly,

13:08.750 --> 13:09.875
in this battle,

13:10.500 --> 13:12.000
you're the victor, Victoria.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.291
I was never worried.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.667
I mean, sure, you're pretty,

13:17.792 --> 13:20.250
have good hair and a nice smile,

13:20.375 --> 13:22.083
but beneath all that,

13:22.375 --> 13:24.000
there's an under-performing brain.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.458
Under-performing?

13:28.166 --> 13:32.250
Synonyms would include
lackluster, sub par, inferior...

13:33.583 --> 13:34.959
Nod when you understand.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.917
The point is you're gonna stop
threatening me, right?

13:40.792 --> 13:41.917
Threatening you?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.542
Yeah, the notes,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.458
the dead flowers in my locker?

13:46.041 --> 13:47.208
I never did any of that.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.583
I don't have to.

13:49.041 --> 13:50.750
I have Victor wrapped around my finger

13:50.834 --> 13:53.000
like a double peptide
wrapped around a protein.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.583
If you were smart you'd be laughing too.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.250
Then who's been leaving me the notes?

14:02.166 --> 14:03.417
Ivy: I think I know.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.834
Start talking, whatever-your-name-is.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.166
It's Petey.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.333
We've been in the same class for 12 years.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.750
Just start talking.

14:13.875 --> 14:16.667
I may have told my girlfriend
you were in love with me.

14:17.333 --> 14:20.208
Unbelievable.
Did you get this idea from Victor?

14:20.542 --> 14:22.333
No. I got it from Myron.

14:22.417 --> 14:23.834
We're in Chess Club together.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.917
Chess Club, it's always Chess Club.

14:26.709 --> 14:27.959
Come on, Paulie.

14:29.709 --> 14:30.792
Okay.

14:31.166 --> 14:34.750
How many of you told your girlfriend
I was in love with you?

14:39.625 --> 14:42.625
All right, now how many of you
told a girl you were interested in,

14:42.709 --> 14:44.208
that I was in love with you?

14:47.333 --> 14:48.375
Right.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.333
Now, how many of you...

14:50.917 --> 14:52.959
don't have anyone
interested in you whatsoever,

14:53.041 --> 14:54.667
you barely know what a girl is,

14:54.750 --> 14:57.917
but you still told someone
I was in love with you?

15:01.166 --> 15:02.125
Yes.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.709
Are moms included in this?

15:04.792 --> 15:06.291
Yes, moms too.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.625
Your hand should be up, Leon.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.625
Has anyone not told a girl
I'm in love with you?

15:18.917 --> 15:21.208
That's what happens
when you miss a meeting, Ollie.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.917
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Deputy Doug.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.250
Thanks for coming by.
You know what? Let's...

15:35.542 --> 15:36.625
Let's talk outside,

15:37.125 --> 15:38.500
away from the lady folk.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.041
Right.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.000
So...

15:41.500 --> 15:43.750
It seems like our wives
are having a problem.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.166
Bet you've been getting an earful of that.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.250
You betcha.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.875
Anyway, I figured you and I could get
together and work things out.

15:54.542 --> 15:56.750
The gals get so emotional, don't they?

15:56.834 --> 15:58.250
- Hey, but not us men.
- Eh.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.500
We're problem solvers, it's what we do.

16:00.583 --> 16:04.083
It's not all we do. We also have the two
best lawns on the street.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.458
Curb appeal. Up top.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.083
All right, so let's settle this.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.500
Just have Debbie come on over,
apologize to Amy

16:13.583 --> 16:15.250
and then the whole thing
will just go away.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.417
Hold up.

16:19.709 --> 16:22.166
Shouldn't Amy be apologizing to Debbie?

16:22.250 --> 16:24.458
And how do you get that?

16:26.667 --> 16:29.875
The wrongdoer apologizes
to the wrongdo-ee.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.583
Wrongdo-ee is not even a word.

16:34.125 --> 16:37.250
- Who went to the Academy here?
- What, the word academy?

16:42.375 --> 16:45.500
Mr. Rose, I wanna assure you
I'm gonna ride herd, on this little guy

16:45.583 --> 16:47.041
to get those grades up. Right, Gabe?

16:47.583 --> 16:49.083
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

16:49.458 --> 16:50.792
Oh, yes, guardian.

16:50.875 --> 16:51.792
Hmm.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.542
I also would have accepted yes, sir.

16:55.417 --> 16:56.417
Well,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.375
I guess everything is in order.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.041
PJ, it was really nice seeing you again.

17:00.125 --> 17:01.834
Yeah. You too, Mr. Rose.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.500
So, what have you been up to lately?

17:03.583 --> 17:06.667
Well, after high school,
I spent a year in Sweden.

17:08.667 --> 17:09.709
Really?

17:09.959 --> 17:11.625
I'm surprised you didn't
pick up the accent.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.917
I am too.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.667
Oh, and one more thing.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.834
I just need you to sign a form
saying we had this home visit.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.083
- But I left it in the car.
- Ah.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.125
- Be right back.
- Sure.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.458
Well, that went well.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
No, it didn't! You can't sign that form!

17:35.083 --> 17:35.959
Why not?

17:36.041 --> 17:38.250
Because your signature won't match
the one I've been signing!

17:39.083 --> 17:41.667
Oh, ja , dat's a problem.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.500
Let go of me, ya big goon!

17:54.583 --> 17:56.542
Just as soon as you un-cuff me, you...

17:57.000 --> 17:58.166
smaller goon!

18:00.208 --> 18:03.834
- What are you two goons doing?
- He's assaulting a Deputy!

18:03.959 --> 18:06.917
Yeah, well, he's assaulting
an Exterminator!

18:07.917 --> 18:09.875
Pretty sure that's different!

18:09.959 --> 18:12.166
Debbie: Oh my! What is this?

18:12.458 --> 18:14.917
- Stay out of it, Dooley!
- Dial it down, Duncan!

18:16.250 --> 18:17.959
Mrs. Dabney: Hey, keep it down over there!

18:18.250 --> 18:20.375
Mind your own business, Mrs. Dabney!

18:20.834 --> 18:23.917
Mrs. Dabney: You can't tell me what to do!
You're not the boss of me!

18:26.291 --> 18:29.709
Did she just say
"you're not the boss of me"?

18:30.667 --> 18:31.792
She did.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.750
That's what Deedee said the other day.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.709
Charlie too.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.041
Well, this is awkward.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.667
Uh...

18:45.166 --> 18:46.834
in a scissor-hold here!

18:46.917 --> 18:48.125
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:48.959 --> 18:49.792
You know,

18:50.417 --> 18:51.750
Deedee's not a problem.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.667
Mrs. Dabney's a problem.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.500
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.208
I'll tell you what I'm sorry about...

19:01.875 --> 19:04.709
I have no idea where I put
the key to those handcuffs.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.291
No, seriously.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.083
Okay. He's almost here. Are you ready?

19:16.208 --> 19:17.500
- Gabe: Ready.
- All right.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.750
I'm back.

19:19.834 --> 19:20.917
Hello.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.792
Come on in.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.917
Where did Gabe go?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.375
Uh...

19:32.166 --> 19:33.583
Oh, I remember now.

19:33.917 --> 19:34.792
I remember.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.208
He went to visit a friend...

19:37.250 --> 19:39.417
upstairs.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.792
Okay, um...

19:42.250 --> 19:43.458
here's the form.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.792
- And here's a pen.
- Thank you.

19:46.875 --> 19:51.208
I'm gonna take my pen from my
left hand and put it in my right hand.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.542
That's my signing hand.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.667
Why are you talking like that?

19:57.208 --> 19:58.542
I don't know.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Now, let's get to signing.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.625
Um, it's just right on the dotted line.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.417
Right... right there!

20:06.500 --> 20:08.542
Right... no, right here. Perfect, yes.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.667
Right there.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.291
Or...

20:11.375 --> 20:12.583
Ah, all over the form.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.583
Good. And a little on the table too.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.500
There you go.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.667
- Thanks, PJ.
- And thank you very much.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.250
I'm gona shake your hand now.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.208
I'm sorry, sorry sorry. It's just...

20:32.583 --> 20:35.500
After so much time in Sweden,
I've forgotten the American customs.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.625
I'll just bow.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.667
Uh, well, bye-bye now.

20:47.417 --> 20:50.083
- Oh, you know, there is one more thing.
- What's that?

20:50.750 --> 20:54.000
Gabe, you want a ride home?
I'm on my way to talk to your parents.

21:02.875 --> 21:03.875
Well, Charlie,

21:03.959 --> 21:06.166
the mysterious warnings have stopped.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.083
Although I'm not exactly sure who did it.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.709
I've narrowed it down to...

21:11.166 --> 21:13.667
Petey's girlfriend, Myron's girlfriend,

21:14.166 --> 21:15.291
or...

21:15.375 --> 21:16.583
Leon's mother.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.375
The point is,

21:19.458 --> 21:23.375
no nerds are using me
as a romantic pawn, as it were.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.417
That's a chess joke.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.208
And therefore...

21:28.291 --> 21:29.542
not funny.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.417
Oh, I wanna show you something.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.375
Oh, this might be it.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.458
Not this one.

21:40.375 --> 21:41.333
Ah,

21:41.917 --> 21:43.125
not this one.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.750
Dad's been handcuffed to this bench
for six hours.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.375
Hey, Bob.

21:50.583 --> 21:53.333
Can we take a break?
I need to use the bathroom.

21:54.542 --> 21:55.792
So do I, Doug.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.250
Oh, sugar-hooey!

22:00.375 --> 22:02.041
Now, I have to start all over.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.417
Better wish dad some good luck, Charlie.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.750
Okay, Charlie, that's enough TV.

22:15.041 --> 22:17.000
You did not just turn that off!

22:18.333 --> 22:19.750
Um,

22:20.166 --> 22:21.250
I'm sorry, what?

22:21.333 --> 22:23.375
I was trying to watch The Gurgles!

22:24.458 --> 22:26.667
PJ, did you let her play in the backyard?

22:26.750 --> 22:27.959
Yeah, what's the problem?

22:28.333 --> 22:31.125
Whenever she stays out there too long,
she starts talking like Mrs. Dabney.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.333
Someone gonna get me a juice box or what?

22:35.917 --> 22:36.750
See?

22:37.125 --> 22:39.208
Oh, relax, Mom. We weren't back there
for very long.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.959
We went over to the Dooleys'
for a little while too, right, Charlie?

22:42.083 --> 22:43.583
Oh, you betcha.
