[students chattering]

00:38.204 --> 00:39.501
(man) Numbers count!

00:44.511 --> 00:47.708
I'm sick of only seeing you
in between classes.

00:47.814 --> 00:52.012
I am this close to cracking open
a book and taking Honors English.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.445
Let's not waste these two minutes
talking about what can never be.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.522
Hey, you two!

00:56.656 --> 00:59.557
You know the school policy.
No violence, no affection.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.294
[birds chirping]

01:09.702 --> 01:12.535
Dammit, Dale.
Are you stealing shingles again?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.572
No. I got a pirate-radio set
at the swap meet.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.540
So I will bring to this neighborhood
a non-stop talk alternative.

01:19.646 --> 01:24.174
A constant barrage of eye-opening
conspiracies and ad-libbed innuendi.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.185
Too bad there's only 24 hours in a day...

01:27.821 --> 01:29.015
or is there?

01:29.789 --> 01:32.883
Tune in to 84.372 to find out!

01:33.059 --> 01:35.050
Put that crap on your own roof!

01:35.161 --> 01:38.289
Ha! I played you like a set of spoons!

01:38.598 --> 01:42.864
I only pretended to put it on your roof
so you'd be okay with it being on my roof.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.263
Sucker!

01:44.571 --> 01:45.629
[snickering]

01:52.045 --> 01:56.482
Left-brain workout over.

Bobby, you better go.
If my dad catches you here...

02:10.597 --> 02:12.997
he'll make me play that song
he wrote about you.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.426
Fat White Lump's about me?

02:16.836 --> 02:18.736
Connie, you need to relax.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.534
I brought my Game Boy.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.607
[groans]

02:21.741 --> 02:23.174
I have to practice.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.302
There's this new kid from Archer City
who's gunning for first chair.

02:26.412 --> 02:28.039
And they say he really knows
how to bring it.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.981

02:52.939 --> 02:55.169
A nefarious government plot to...

02:55.275 --> 02:58.369
store our nation's silver supply
in our mouths.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.442
Children, I implore you.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.681

03:02.949 --> 03:07.648
(Dale) This is 24-hour Gribble Talk
serviig the eitire tri-house area,

03:08.288 --> 03:10.950
Dale is a terrible radio personality.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.158
Hey, we're listening to him.
He must be doing something right.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.353
[Bobby panting]

03:18.231 --> 03:20.665
If he ran that fast at baseball tryouts....

03:21.167 --> 03:23.533
Nah, he still can't hit for beans.

03:24.003 --> 03:27.200
Where you hiding Jethro?
Under haystack in living room?

03:27.307 --> 03:28.331
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.535
I wouldn't allow that
non-conforming putter on the golf course.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.374
And I certainly won't let you
beat my son with it.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.447
[shouting in Laotian]

03:36.849 --> 03:39.875
Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm a broiled ox penis.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.649
You can't just order her
to break up with him, Kahn.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.685
Teenagers very rebellious.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.818
Big reason I started dating you
was to rebel against Papa.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.362
I thought the General liked me.

03:51.497 --> 03:55.866
No. He never think you're good enough.
For my sister maybe, but not me.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.000
We leave Laos
to make better life for Connie.

03:59.105 --> 04:01.938
And Bobby Hill ruin everything!

04:02.508 --> 04:05.944
I am gonna find a way to pry
our truffle out of that pig's snout.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.681
Hey, neighbor.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.445
It's the Bobby-Mobile Express to school.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.316
[mimics train whistle]

04:15.421 --> 04:16.387
Hop in.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.116
No, thanks. I'd rather walk.
And I don't much care for walking.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.621
So you can imagine how I feel
about you right now.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.831
Bobby, I'm reaching out.
Don't leave me hanging, big guy.

04:30.670 --> 04:35.130
You and I may have many differences.
But we do have one thing in common.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.175
We both want what's best
for my little girl.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.406
That's true.

04:40.513 --> 04:43.209
I am glad to see we are on the same page.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.315
So here's $300 to break up with Connie.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.053
Save that money for our wedding.
That's right!

04:52.158 --> 04:55.286
Steve Harvey isn't gonna fly himself
in from L.A.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.229
Bobby, deep inside those folds...

04:58.431 --> 05:01.696
you must know that you and Connie
do not belong together.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.598
She is destined for Harvard.

05:03.703 --> 05:07.434
You are destined for something less.
Maybe retail.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.667
I will not end up behind a counter!
I will be a prop comic.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.272
Connie will be a concert violinist.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.178
And we will find a way
to be on the road together.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.210
That is the future!

05:19.352 --> 05:22.651
I suggest you get used to it, Dad!

05:25.558 --> 05:26.684
You think about it!

05:26.793 --> 05:30.126
$300 buy a lot of
fake vomit for comedy act.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.891
I can't believe my dad tried to bribe you.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.999
Someday I'm gonna put him
in such a second-tier nursing home.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.036
Hey, lovebirds. No PDAs!

05:39.405 --> 05:42.135
This is torture!
We can't hold hands in school.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.975
We can't hold hands at home.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.103
If we don't hold hands soon,
I'm gonna lose it!

05:51.818 --> 05:55.618
[crying] Mom! Dad!
Bobby broke up with me!

05:55.988 --> 05:59.185
Wow! You have taught me
the meaning of total surprise.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.624
He said he liked me,
but he wasn't ""in like"" with me.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.089
[sobbing]

06:05.031 --> 06:08.000
I don't know about this.
It's one thing to bribe a judge. But--

06:08.101 --> 06:09.534
Don't you go soft on me!

06:09.635 --> 06:12.798
Better she cry now for 10 minutes,
than spend 45 years crying...

06:12.905 --> 06:16.466
that Bobby Hill still not get promotion
at dirt factory.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.042
[whistling]

06:26.953 --> 06:27.920
[both gasp]

06:28.721 --> 06:31.451
-Sorry, sir.
-Not at all.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.496
(Connie) Bobby!

06:37.730 --> 06:39.698
He bought it, Connie! We're free!

06:39.866 --> 06:41.026
Gun it!

06:41.434 --> 06:42.662
[Bobby grunting]

06:57.417 --> 07:00.011
Finally we can be alone.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.028
Connie, will you hold my hand?

07:11.664 --> 07:13.029
I'd love to.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.338
[yawns]

07:19.872 --> 07:23.433
If your dad knew he paid us $300
to hold hands...

07:23.543 --> 07:26.979
and look at ourselves in a mirror,
he'd go crazy!

07:27.180 --> 07:29.580
Good. He doesn't care about me at all.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.912
All he cares about are my stupid grades.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.846
Let's see how my dad likes it when
I'm too sad because you dumped me...

07:35.955 --> 07:37.513
to pass my bio midterm.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.622
You're gonna fail a test on purpose?

07:41.928 --> 07:46.365
You have never been more beautiful
to me than you are right now.

07:47.099 --> 07:51.229
After 60 hours on the air, folks,
I have to apologize.

07:51.337 --> 07:54.135
That last caller
was not the real Spiro Agnew.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.141
Although he did make some cogent points.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.971
It's live talk radio, people,
Workiig without a iet here,

08:01.681 --> 08:05.276
Okay, our iext caller
from iearby McMayierbury,,,

08:05.618 --> 08:07.017
oh, it must be a wiidy day,,,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.347
is, aid this is quite ai hoior,,,

08:09.455 --> 08:12.424
former Soviet Premier Leoiid Brezhiev,

08:13.192 --> 08:15.990
C, C-plus, two B-minuses.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.118
[sighs]

08:18.231 --> 08:20.358
You really did it this time, Son.

08:21.634 --> 08:25.161
You set realistic goals and
you reached them. Way to go!

08:25.438 --> 08:26.496
(Peggy) With grades like that...

08:26.739 --> 08:29.970
you could become governor
and then president someday.

08:30.309 --> 08:31.276
[Kahn screaming]

08:32.445 --> 08:36.107
An F?
A-minus is unacceptable in this house.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.183
Even regular A, we're not so crazy about.
What's going on?

08:40.419 --> 08:43.513
I'm so upset. I can't concentrate.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.520
The frog I had to dissect was looking
at me just like Bobby used to.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.394
[grunts]

08:51.163 --> 08:52.221
But don't worry.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.424
Pretty soon I'll be getting
much better grades.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.163
They're taking me out of Honors Bio
and putting me in life-skills class.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.371
[screaming]

09:00.773 --> 09:01.865
There it is again.

09:02.341 --> 09:07.278
Now, the proper way to clean your ears
is to gently swab around the rim.

09:08.147 --> 09:13.016
Puncture the eardrum and you'll hear
a pop, followed by a lifetime of silence.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.786
-ls this it?
-(Peterson) Now, people....

09:14.887 --> 09:18.323
Is he gonna say anything about
the anatomical structure of the ear?

09:18.858 --> 09:22.760
No. Just the cleaning.
This is actually a review from yesterday.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.054
Got that? Cotton swabs.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.765
Passing notes, Connie?
""I'm so bored I could kill myself?""

09:33.739 --> 09:34.706
[gasps]

09:34.874 --> 09:36.000
Oh, my God!

09:38.177 --> 09:40.907
I ain't seen you folks
since Connie won the science fair.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.311
Yeah. Well, things have gone downhill
since then.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.077
We think she's suicidal.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.575
No!

09:46.686 --> 09:48.586
I caught her passing this note to Bobby.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.883
I gotta make sure
your kids aren't planning some kind of...

09:50.990 --> 09:53.754
I jump, you jump,
Dungeons and Dragons crap.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.691
This isn't a suicide note.
Connie's just bored.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.332
I hope this is just a harmless note.

10:02.001 --> 10:05.232
It's possible that Connie, for some reason,
just wasn't interested...

10:05.338 --> 10:07.169
in my ear-hygiene lecture.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.369
But isn't it more likely
that she is a deeply troubled little girl...

10:11.477 --> 10:12.739
and this is her cry for help?

10:12.912 --> 10:16.814
Connie don't need help. She perfect.
That's why we love her.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.817
Perfect, huh? I notice Connie's grades
have been slipping.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.386
That's often a warning sign.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.847
Kahn, you know what this is about.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.284
[speaking Laotian]

10:26.258 --> 10:27.350
[speaking Laotian]

10:27.560 --> 10:28.584
Bobby....

10:28.894 --> 10:30.020
[speaking Laotian]

10:30.429 --> 10:31.396
Bobby....

10:32.064 --> 10:33.793
[both speaking Laotian]

10:33.899 --> 10:37.130
Okay, okay!
It's because Bobby dumped Connie!

10:37.570 --> 10:40.801
What? They broke up?
Did you know about this?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.907
Hank, I am not on trial here.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.101
Kahn and Minh are, and possibly
Bobby and Connie, but not me.

10:47.713 --> 10:50.181
-Can I have some water?
-It's all my fault!

10:50.282 --> 10:52.477
I never think he good enough for my girl!

10:52.585 --> 10:57.079
Now I realize Bobby Hill
only thing keeping her alive.

10:57.523 --> 11:01.015
Of all the kids you march in here,
Peterson, you finally got one right.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.352
We're gonna have to give back that $300.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.954
We've only got $280 left.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.193
Where are we gonna get $20?

11:10.803 --> 11:12.634
(Hank) Well, thank you, Carl.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.838
Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.204
No, no, no, no.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.117
All your mother and I ever want for you
is to be happy.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.477
That's why we push you so hard.

11:27.586 --> 11:30.487
And now you're not happy being away
from Bobby Hill.

11:30.589 --> 11:33.456
So we push you right back together
with him.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.523
Oh, yeah!
If I'm back together with Bobby...

11:36.629 --> 11:37.891
I won't want to kill myself.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.021
Perfect!

11:39.131 --> 11:43.830
Tonight, I take everyone out to fancy
ltalian dinner at That's Amore.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.337
I always have very strong feelings
about Hill family.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.065
Now those feelings are of love.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.908
(Dale) All right, let's see,,,

11:53.479 --> 11:56.277
I told you about
the sperm-couit-loweriig soft driiks,

11:56.382 --> 12:01.012
Told you about SuperCuts catalogiig DNA,
I'm ruiiiig dry here, Wait!

12:01.821 --> 12:05.780
Is there aiy coicrete evideice
that Hawaii actually exists,,,,

12:06.092 --> 12:08.356
No, I already covered that,

12:10.996 --> 12:13.396
Does aiyoie remember The Drifters?

12:17.269 --> 12:19.703
[Uider The Boardwalk
by The Drifters playing on radio]

12:22.641 --> 12:25.235
All these years, Bobby wasn't
good enough for Connie.

12:25.344 --> 12:29.508
Now suddenly Kahn's kissing our asses
like the paperboy at Christmas time.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.977
I am not even sure
Bobby should take her back.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.979
As a person who has worked
with children for many years...

12:35.154 --> 12:38.646
I can tell you this:
the suicidal ones are trouble.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.522
Connie's not suicidal, she was just upset.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.019
It's not like when we were kids, Peggy.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.621
Teenagers in love today
can get very emotional.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.594
Which novelty tie
goes better with this suit?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.566
Piano or fish?

12:52.538 --> 12:53.596

-Piano.

12:55.741 --> 12:56.730
[piano playing]

12:56.842 --> 12:57.831
[glass clinking]

12:57.943 --> 13:00.503
They call this place That's Amore!

13:00.646 --> 13:02.546
Ah, Amore!

13:02.648 --> 13:05.378
Love. So perfect.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.543
It is in the air tonight.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.415
Now let us drink to this young couple...

13:10.523 --> 13:12.855
while they kiss and make up.

13:19.965 --> 13:24.231
I don't know if all parents are biased when
they watch their kids kiss other kids.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.930
But Bobby really is the better kisser.

13:30.709 --> 13:34.611
Hey, it's Reuiitedby Peaches and Herb.
Come on, you two.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.545
Get out on dance floor.
Hand on shoulders. Stare in eyes.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.776
All that jazz.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.422
It's so creepy the way
they keep staring at us.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.985
On the plus side, now that
he thinks you want to kill yourself...

13:52.131 --> 13:53.962
he hasn't tried to kill me.

13:56.635 --> 13:57.795
[groaning]

13:57.903 --> 14:01.930
I must say Bobby is very light on his feet
for a boy of his shape.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.468
Like a young Jackie Gleason.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.906
What Bobby doing tomorrow at 6:00?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.940
I schedule Connie for a Bobby-block
every night this week.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.014
Let's see.... Yeah. Tomorrow at 6:00 it is.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.314
Monday was the roller rink.
Tonight we see Bathtub ofBlood Two,,,

14:20.593 --> 14:22.220
starring Julia Roberts' brother.

14:25.030 --> 14:29.194

14:40.446 --> 14:41.504
(Kahn) Hey, Hank.

14:41.914 --> 14:46.544
How about you and I mosey over
to refreshment stand for long time?

14:46.919 --> 14:48.944
Leave the lovebirds all alone.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.481
Kissy-kissy.

14:50.856 --> 14:51.823
[laughing]

14:55.127 --> 14:56.617
I thought they'd never leave.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.825
[mai chatteriig]

15:00.199 --> 15:01.496
What are you doing?

15:02.935 --> 15:06.166
First time all week we've been alone
and you're doing homework?

15:06.272 --> 15:09.605
I'm not gonna get into Harvard
watching slasher films.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.409
You always hated
when your dad made you study.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.911
And now you're doing it behind his back?

15:15.347 --> 15:19.647
Bobby, I don't overachieve because
my dad makes me. I do it because....

15:20.419 --> 15:23.946
Well, there are some very complicated
psychological reasons that I don't...

15:24.056 --> 15:26.923
quite understand,
because you keep talking!

15:28.694 --> 15:31.993
Is it me?
Or is it getting a little nerdy in here?

15:33.565 --> 15:35.192
(Kahn) Thanks for paying for Milk Duds.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.997
Well, just getting you back
for the steak and lobster.

15:38.237 --> 15:41.638
Hey, try putting some of those Duds
in your popcorn. It's wild.

15:42.942 --> 15:47.003
Can't you stop talking about school?
I wish Joseph was here.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.509
Now there's a guy who enjoys
watching a good stabbing.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.380
Well, I wish my violin was here.
At least I'd have something...

15:53.485 --> 15:55.715
to carry on
an intelligent conversation with.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.948
I wish it was here,
so I could throw it out the window!

15:58.057 --> 16:01.823
I'd like to see you try.
It would be Bobby Hill's last movement!

16:02.962 --> 16:06.625
[scoffs] You don't even get it.
It's a music joke! ""Movement?""

16:07.132 --> 16:09.430
My mind went right to poop.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.662
[groans] It's always poop with you!

16:13.339 --> 16:15.330
Why aren't windows all fogged up?

16:15.441 --> 16:18.501
My God! What happened to
the Mrs. I.P. Daley...

16:18.610 --> 16:20.703
I checked into the Jolly Roger with?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.542
She doesn't want to have to pick
a medical school...

16:22.648 --> 16:25.617
based on what clown college you get into!

16:25.718 --> 16:26.980
[Kahn exclaims]

16:29.221 --> 16:32.588
Do something! You're killing her!

16:35.594 --> 16:38.290
(Dale) Cock-a-doodle-doo!
It's the moriiig zoo!

16:39.698 --> 16:41.165
Morning, baby!

16:42.368 --> 16:45.826
You look sad.
You must be upset about fight with Bobby.

16:45.938 --> 16:46.962
But that okay.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.098
I schedule hot-air balloon ride
for two of you.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.540
I'm not sure I want to do
anything with Bobby.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.545
What? No, no, no, no! Come on!

16:55.748 --> 16:58.842
We go deep-fry some peanut butter
and banana sandwiches.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.448
The fun we'll have.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.982
Yeah, Kahn. You go fry your bananas.
Knock yourself out.

17:09.494 --> 17:12.055
He can fry a banana sandwich pretty quick.
So, spill it!

17:12.231 --> 17:16.565
Mom, I was never suicidal.
And Bobby and I never broke up.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.567
We were only pretending
so we could spend more time together.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.104
You lied to us?

17:21.205 --> 17:24.073
Yeah. But now that we've spent
all this time together...

17:24.542 --> 17:26.135
I don't know if he's right for me.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.345
Oh.

17:27.913 --> 17:32.316
You know, honey, back in Laos,

17:32.651 --> 17:36.018

17:36.321 --> 17:39.950

17:42.528 --> 17:44.792

17:48.834 --> 17:50.665

18:10.389 --> 18:12.118

18:12.291 --> 18:15.749
The corporate boy or the bad boy,

18:19.264 --> 18:20.390
[motorcycle revving]

18:22.167 --> 18:25.432
Okay. You picked Dad
because Grandpa hated him.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.105
So I should stay with Bobby?

18:28.340 --> 18:32.436
No. I picked your Dad because
even though we very different...

18:32.778 --> 18:34.507
I knew he was right for me.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.471
I can't tell you if Bobby
right for you or not.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.382
Your Dad can't tell you either.
Only you can decide.

18:45.757 --> 18:49.557

commeits that were deemed iiseisitive,,,

So I have been forced to sell
the station to Mexican interests.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.643
[speaking Spanish]

19:09.381 --> 19:10.643

19:11.550 --> 19:12.812

19:19.391 --> 19:20.688
[music playiig]

19:23.495 --> 19:24.484
[switch clicks]

19:24.596 --> 19:26.530
You look like you're thinking, Son.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.226
There something you want
to talk to your mother about?

19:29.468 --> 19:32.062
Dad, I'm thinking of calling it quits
with Connie.

19:32.304 --> 19:33.396
Again?

19:33.572 --> 19:37.008
Bobby, ladies don't like
mind games and drama...

19:37.376 --> 19:39.241
they like predictability.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.345
I don't want to hurt her.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.914
But I've never broken up
with anyone before.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.749
How do I do it?

19:45.851 --> 19:49.981
Well, I've only been with your Mom,
and we never broke up.

19:50.556 --> 19:54.788
But I have fired people at
Strickland Propane. You got to be honest.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.687
Tell them how they didn't meet your...

19:56.795 --> 19:59.093
expectations and promise them
a good recommendation.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.706
Hey, Connie. You up for a game?

20:11.176 --> 20:12.404
Sure.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.502
I'll be Lu Manchu. You be Daisy Wah.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.817
(Bobby) You're terrible at this.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.584
I know. I hate video games.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.189
I know.

20:24.990 --> 20:29.120
Connie, I didn't just call you over here
because check-out's at 1 1 :00.

20:32.698 --> 20:36.862
Well, you've been a valuable part
of the organization for two years now.

20:37.002 --> 20:37.969
But....

20:38.337 --> 20:39.895
Are you firing me?

20:40.138 --> 20:41.105
[mumbling]

20:41.740 --> 20:44.504
I think we should break up.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.909
What? But I came here
to break up with you.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.880
You're just saying that.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.279
No. I mean it.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.715
I composed a break-up letter
and everything.

20:55.354 --> 20:59.450
""Bobby, there are some fundamental
differences that suggest....""

20:59.591 --> 21:02.219
My God! You are such a nerd!

21:02.561 --> 21:05.462
I know!
And all you care about is having fun.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.464
I know! And you don't!

21:07.699 --> 21:08.859
I know!

21:12.137 --> 21:16.801
I guess it's gonna be kind of weird not
being boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.870
Maybe a little.
But it's not like we hate each other.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.909
No, no. We're still friends, right?

21:24.316 --> 21:25.806
Right. Friends.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.282
And still neighbors.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.554
Sure. Unless you're moving.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.288
I'm not going anywhere.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.516
Neither am l.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.920
We've still got 20 minutes left
on the room.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.393
Maybe we could hold hands one last time?

22:29.614 --> 22:31.104
(Kahi) Fat white lump!
