WEBVTT

00:04.730 --> 00:06.338
How long has the pursuit
been going?

00:06.565 --> 00:07.489
Six minutes, high speed.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.657
Armed suspect
and his girlfriend.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.251
<i>-MAN: Shots fired, shots fired.</i>
-Copy that, shots fired.

00:11.403 --> 00:13.495
This thing's gonna start
generating other calls.

00:13.572 --> 00:15.222
It's gonna be a day.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.091
911. What's your emergency?

00:18.244 --> 00:20.552
<i> WOMAN:</i>
<i> Yeah, my boyfriend's driving</i>
<i> the car you guys are chasing.</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:22.412
<i> -MAN: What the hell</i>
<i> are you doing?</i>
<i> -Making sure these people know</i>

00:22.431 --> 00:24.414
<i> -that I got no part of this.</i>
<i> -Hang up, now!</i>

00:24.433 --> 00:26.191
-Are you hurt, ma'am?
<i> -No, but</i>
<i> he's gonna get me killed.</i>

00:26.343 --> 00:27.860
<i> MAN:</i>
<i> Put that phone down now,</i>
<i> you crazy bitch.</i>

00:28.087 --> 00:29.361
Doreen, you need to tell him
to pull over

00:29.588 --> 00:31.697
-and surrender peacefully.
<i> -He won't listen.</i>

00:31.848 --> 00:33.014
Okay, stay on the line with me.

00:33.108 --> 00:34.199
I've got his girlfriend
on the line.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.517
Tell her to get him to stop.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.902
I tried that.
He's not interested.

00:37.054 --> 00:38.612
Try again.

00:38.764 --> 00:41.189
-Do you have any idea
where he's headed?
<i> -Probably to his mama.</i>

00:41.358 --> 00:43.024
<i> She's over on Wetherly.</i>

00:43.193 --> 00:44.710
<i> Always runs to her</i>
<i> when he has a problem.</i>

00:44.879 --> 00:46.378
<i> MAN: Are you crazy? Don't</i>
<i> tell them that. Give me that!</i>

00:46.530 --> 00:48.213
Okay, suspect's mother
lives on Wetherly.

00:48.365 --> 00:50.698
-He might be heading her way.
-Dispatching additional units.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.700
-What about spike strips?
-They're not in position
for that.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.294
How we doing, Doreen?

00:54.446 --> 00:55.962
<i> He's slowing down!</i>
<i> He's slowing down!</i>

00:56.115 --> 00:57.447
Girlfriend says car's
slowing down.

00:57.541 --> 00:59.374
<i> -Whatever, mama's boy!</i>
-All units, all units be advised

00:59.393 --> 01:00.559
suspect is abandoning
his vehicle.

01:00.786 --> 01:02.953
Suspect is about to be on foot.

01:03.046 --> 01:05.213
-Airship's up, en route now.
-Finally.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.957
<i> DOREEN:</i>
<i> He's running. What do I do?</i>

01:06.975 --> 01:08.883
Okay, stay in the vehicle
and await police instructions.

01:08.977 --> 01:10.885
Did he leave the weapon
or take it with him?

01:10.905 --> 01:12.796
<i> DOREEN:</i>
<i> He's got it with him.</i>

01:12.815 --> 01:14.631
All units,
suspect remains armed.

01:14.724 --> 01:16.742
Girlfriend is in vehicle,
unarmed, awaiting instruction.

01:16.893 --> 01:19.469
Name is Doreen.

01:20.155 --> 01:22.322
Claudette, I had a pursuit
here last week.

01:22.474 --> 01:23.248
The suspects fled down the alley

01:23.475 --> 01:24.975
between Armadale
and York Street.

01:24.993 --> 01:26.326
Behind the burger place.
Just have them

01:26.478 --> 01:28.478
take the alley cutout:
Armadale and York.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.980
Not now.
Linda, give me something.

01:30.073 --> 01:32.833
-Airship's on the scene,
joining pursuit.
-Okay.

01:32.985 --> 01:34.075
Mom's house is six blocks away.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.319
Units are on the way
to intercept.

01:35.321 --> 01:36.670
And here I thought for once

01:36.822 --> 01:39.247
we'd go through a whole shift
without a pursuit.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.507
Josh, you knew better
than to make that bet.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.101
<i> OFFICER: 44. We are now</i>
<i> in foot pursuit,</i>

01:42.252 --> 01:44.603
<i> -approaching Armadale.</i>
-Copy. In foot pursuit.

01:44.754 --> 01:47.180
Units, if you take the alley
between Armadale and York,

01:47.333 --> 01:49.591
you should be able
to cut the suspect off.

01:49.685 --> 01:51.259
<i> OFFICER 2: 41 copy,</i>
<i> taking Armadale alley.</i>

01:51.353 --> 01:52.836
<i> OFFICER 3:</i>
<i> Adam 33 in the area.</i>

01:52.929 --> 01:54.262
<i> We'll cover the</i>
<i> York Street side.</i>

01:54.356 --> 01:57.524
<i> -Stop! Show me your hands.</i>
<i> -On the ground, now.</i>

01:57.676 --> 01:59.509
<i> OFFICER:</i>
<i> Dispatch, we're Code 4.</i>

01:59.528 --> 02:00.435
Copy.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.621
-Code 4.
<i> -Suspect in custody.</i>

02:02.772 --> 02:03.789
JOSH:
Nice job.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.016
The alley cutoff was inspired.

02:06.034 --> 02:08.085
Yeah, it seemed like
the obvious call.

02:14.284 --> 02:18.119
"Obvious call"? Yeah, obvious,
because I told her to do it.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.363
So, you want the credit.

02:19.381 --> 02:20.714
I just want an acknowledgement

02:20.883 --> 02:22.641
that other people exist
in her world.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.885
-You don't know what she's like.
-Oh, no, I know the type.

02:24.961 --> 02:27.795
I had more than a few sergeants
just like her coming up.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.706
Yeah, that sort of behavior
went out a long time ago.

02:29.799 --> 02:31.799
She's a dinosaur, a bully.

02:31.894 --> 02:33.635
I just need to
stand up to her, I know.

02:33.729 --> 02:35.136
Yeah, stand up for yourself.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.822
Talk to her. Work it out.

02:36.899 --> 02:39.716
Well, I thought we had,
but with Claudette it's always

02:39.735 --> 02:41.660
two steps forward, and then
get stabbed in the back.

02:41.811 --> 02:46.056
If anything's pushing me
to go to college, it's her.

02:46.225 --> 02:47.833
No, you do that because
you want to go,

02:48.026 --> 02:50.894
not because you were
chased there.

02:50.987 --> 02:52.504
Well, thank you, guys,

02:52.656 --> 02:56.066
-and thank you for breakfast.
-Mm-hmm.

02:56.084 --> 02:57.734
Have a wonderful day,
sweetheart.

02:57.827 --> 02:59.569
Thank you.
I have another shift.

02:59.588 --> 03:01.597
All right. Go get 'em.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.093
Hey. Maybe you should talk
to the dinosaur.

03:07.246 --> 03:09.413
No, no, no.
I promised May I wouldn't.

03:09.431 --> 03:11.506
What about Sue? Did you promise
not to talk to her, too?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.841
So you think I should ask
to speak to the manager?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.861
Yes. And if you don't,
I will.

03:16.012 --> 03:17.921
Don't you think that's
a little extreme?

03:18.014 --> 03:19.847
The fire captain
showing up at Dispatch

03:19.867 --> 03:21.091
to file a complaint?

03:21.109 --> 03:22.993
Mess with my kid,
you mess with me.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.704
You know what I mean.

03:25.931 --> 03:28.373
Oh, I do, and it's sweet.

03:28.525 --> 03:30.709
But don't you go down there,
Papa Bear.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.545
(takes deep breath)

03:33.697 --> 03:36.131
Understood.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.253
<i> CHIMNEY:</i>
<i> That was the nicest leasing</i>
<i> office I've been in.</i>

03:41.480 --> 03:43.871
I think that was eucalyptus
in that diffuser, huh?

03:43.966 --> 03:47.017
Okay, Orrington Plaza.

03:48.954 --> 03:52.472
Oh, this place is great.
Huge pool, spa.

03:52.624 --> 03:54.291
And the gym has
a Narcissus machine.

03:54.309 --> 03:57.602
Wow. You know, this is historic.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.238
It is?

03:59.389 --> 04:02.148
Albert, there comes a time
in every big brother's life

04:02.301 --> 04:03.575
when he is set free.

04:03.802 --> 04:05.893
Free to stop worrying about
the fate of his little bro.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.139
-Oh, God.
-Look at you.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.641
Your days of couch surfing,
guest room haunting

04:11.660 --> 04:13.585
and general freeloading are
coming to an end.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.905
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I'm not sure I even like it.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.074
And besides, the leasing office
already said

04:20.094 --> 04:21.501
they're not gonna go
month-to-month.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.262
What if I don't have a job
in six months?

04:23.413 --> 04:24.671
Why wouldn't you have a job?

04:24.823 --> 04:26.990
You're not getting fired
or something, are you?

04:27.009 --> 04:30.677
I just think that maybe
the job's harder

04:30.771 --> 04:32.679
than I thought it would be.

04:32.831 --> 04:34.697
The first year's always hard.

04:34.758 --> 04:37.667
It just takes some time
to find your sea legs.

04:37.761 --> 04:38.944
You just gotta hang in there.

04:39.095 --> 04:40.779
My probationary year
is almost over.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.365
Shouldn't I have
found them by now?

04:44.526 --> 04:48.695
Maybe... I'm just not
cut out for this.

04:48.847 --> 04:51.606
Come on. You're my brother.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.252
You were born to do this,
just like me.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.204
Still don't like the place.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.591
Then we'll keep looking,
all right, little brother?

05:08.291 --> 05:10.309
(beeps)

05:10.460 --> 05:11.793
(sighs)

05:11.887 --> 05:14.796
Terry? (sighs)

05:14.890 --> 05:16.056
Must we commit
to going paperless

05:16.208 --> 05:17.482
on a day
when my tablet is acting up?

05:17.709 --> 05:20.134
-Again?
-It's probably user error.
Again.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.728
I'll take a look
when I'm done moving these,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.897
and you guys wanted
to go paperless.

05:24.049 --> 05:25.139
Correction. He did.

05:25.233 --> 05:26.842
I didn't realize
it was going to be a parade.

05:26.844 --> 05:28.327
Scanner's on two, so we have

05:28.478 --> 05:30.162
to bring paperwork
from high and low, literally.

05:30.313 --> 05:31.479
It's more like a ballet.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.557
How about more Twyla
and less Fosse?

05:33.575 --> 05:34.666
I'll try.

05:34.893 --> 05:36.001
After I google what that means.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.244
-How's your coffee?
-(chuckles)

05:38.397 --> 05:41.840
I have to say, I never thought--
not in a million years--

05:42.067 --> 05:45.177
that I would love
a superfood creamer made

05:45.404 --> 05:46.845
from coconut milk
and marine algae.

05:46.996 --> 05:48.572
The algae's where
they get the calcium.

05:48.665 --> 05:51.591
(laughing):
You truly have become one of us.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.909
Yeah.

05:53.670 --> 05:57.022
But maybe you're not planning
on being one of us forever?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.265
Uh...

05:59.418 --> 06:01.509
the whole desk thing is still
a little new to me.

06:01.603 --> 06:03.269
I'm used to being out there,
riding the rig,

06:03.364 --> 06:05.697
-slinging the hoses,
working up a sweat.
-You don't work up

06:05.924 --> 06:07.757
-a sweat slinging tweets?
-Different kind of sweat.

06:07.776 --> 06:10.035
(laughs)
When I was in my 20s,

06:10.186 --> 06:11.703
my mother liked
to say, repeatedly,

06:11.930 --> 06:14.114
"Linda, you can tie yourself
in knots

06:14.266 --> 06:15.874
"trying to find a career
that suits you,

06:16.025 --> 06:18.952
"but at the end of the day,
God will tell you where you need

06:19.104 --> 06:20.695
-to be in this world."
-Mm.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.939
-Well, I hope
he gives me a shout soon.
-Yeah.

06:22.958 --> 06:25.675
You took my ambulance?!

06:26.553 --> 06:27.869
Excuse you?

06:27.963 --> 06:29.446
-You redirected my ambulance.
-That unit

06:29.539 --> 06:30.964
was closer to a higher priority

06:31.058 --> 06:33.040
emergency,
a bigger casualty risk.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.451
But I'd already told my caller
that...

06:34.469 --> 06:37.062
-Did you get a unit there?
-Yes.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.972
And was your victim alive
when you disconnected?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.974
(scoffs)
That's not the point.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.050
But it is, sweetie.
That's exactly the point.

06:43.145 --> 06:46.129
We're not children here
competing for the best LEGOs

06:46.148 --> 06:48.465
to build our pretend
skyscrapers with.

06:48.483 --> 06:51.243
-We are a team.
-Is that what we are?

06:51.394 --> 06:54.654
-We're a team?
Why didn't I think of that?
-I don't know.

06:54.806 --> 06:56.081
Youth? Inexperience?

06:56.232 --> 06:57.641
-Indifference? You tell me.
-No.

06:57.734 --> 06:59.418
The rest of us are a team,
but you're not.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.086
-Sweetie...
-I'm not your sweetie!

07:01.237 --> 07:02.662
Enough! Come with me.

07:02.831 --> 07:06.174
-Get your girl, Sue.
-SUE: Both of you. Let's go.

07:09.504 --> 07:13.915
Terry, it's not even lunch yet,
and I am having a day.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.011
My tablet won't work, I've got
boxes all over my call center.

07:18.163 --> 07:21.106
How else are you going to turn
my world upside down?

07:22.684 --> 07:24.668
Can I help you?

07:24.761 --> 07:27.003
-You're not Terry.
-No.

07:27.096 --> 07:29.448
-He just took off.
-Okay.

07:29.599 --> 07:31.508
I'll just, uh...

07:31.526 --> 07:32.951
Who are you?

07:33.102 --> 07:36.771
Carson. I'm installing
the new clean agent system.

07:36.865 --> 07:38.439
Oh. Clean agents.

07:38.533 --> 07:42.043
Much better than
the dirty agent, am I right?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.204
Right.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.132
(metallic clacking nearby)

07:48.635 --> 07:51.118
It's a fire suppression system.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.288
Oh, I'm aware. Dispatchers know
all about this stuff.

07:54.457 --> 07:57.809
It uses the inert gas to suck
all the oxygen out of the room.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.978
Thought only my mother
could do that.

08:00.205 --> 08:01.204
It would suffocate her
pretty quick.

08:01.223 --> 08:03.556
Yeah, leaves you breathless
I guess.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.967
Always wondered
what that felt like.

08:06.135 --> 08:08.636
(clears throat)
Oh, I should introduce myself.

08:08.714 --> 08:10.638
-I'm...
-Josh.

08:10.732 --> 08:12.306
Wait. You know my name?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.809
Terry was giving me
the grand tour yesterday,

08:14.828 --> 08:17.621
and, um, I asked about you.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.958
-You seem really good
at what you do.
-Thanks.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.990
I, uh... I'm gonna go down
to the basement

08:29.067 --> 08:31.009
-and connect power
to this thing.
-Yeah, I'll go with you.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.678
Uh, to the elevator.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.755
Isn't Dispatch upstairs?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.407
Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.668
-(chuckles)
-Nice meeting you,
clean agent, uh...

08:40.762 --> 08:42.003
-Carson.
-Yeah.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.172
I'm much nicer
than that other agent.

08:45.267 --> 08:48.109
-Oh. Yeah.
-(laughs)

08:54.201 --> 08:57.035
Nice. You got us sent
to the principal's office.

08:57.262 --> 08:58.537
Shouldn't have stolen
my ambulance.

08:58.764 --> 09:01.022
Oh, are you feeling nostalgic
for middle school again?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.449
You only graduated,
what, last week?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.752
Give it a rest.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.551
(Claudette chuckles)

09:12.702 --> 09:13.943
Well, this is tragic.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.962
Oh, you want
to know what's tragic?

09:16.114 --> 09:17.722
The fact
that you're still talking.

09:17.949 --> 09:19.707
-(scoffs) Finally.
-And you.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.560
I expected more from you.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.288
So, welcome to the quiet room.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.380
Designed for dispatchers
who need

09:26.400 --> 09:27.882
a little time off the floor,

09:27.901 --> 09:31.319
or in this case, a time-out.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.580
(buzzing)

09:59.600 --> 10:01.224
(beeps)

10:02.828 --> 10:04.102
Carson,

10:04.253 --> 10:06.587
I just got an alert about
the fire suppression system.

10:06.681 --> 10:09.666
(rhythmic beeping)

10:09.684 --> 10:11.592
What the hell?

10:11.686 --> 10:13.320
(rhythmic beeping continues)

10:17.509 --> 10:18.617
Oh!

10:19.602 --> 10:21.511
(electrical hissing)

10:21.529 --> 10:24.331
(screaming)

10:26.743 --> 10:28.627
What is that?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.613
(electrical buzzing)

10:32.633 --> 10:34.023
(sighs)

10:34.117 --> 10:36.951
Well, I need to go and check
on whatever that was.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.028
Try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

10:39.122 --> 10:42.682
We can't spare the resources.

10:45.036 --> 10:47.537
(hissing)

10:47.630 --> 10:49.147
No! No!

10:51.209 --> 10:52.542
-(knocking)
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.878
-Did you get it, too?
-Yeah, power surge.

10:55.046 --> 10:57.822
-No, this alert.
-"Fire suppression system."

10:57.974 --> 10:59.324
Is that the sprinklers
or the new CAS?

10:59.475 --> 11:00.825
It's that, uh, waterless system.

11:01.052 --> 11:02.827
Yeah, sucks all the oxygen
out of a room.

11:03.054 --> 11:05.071
I met the guy
who was installing it.

11:05.148 --> 11:07.924
Hmm. If you met him,
you should go talk to him.

11:07.926 --> 11:09.742
Oh, uh, I-I can't.

11:09.895 --> 11:14.080
I've-I've got the floor,
and Sue is dealing with, um...

11:14.232 --> 11:17.083
-Oh. Yeah, I heard it.
-Everyone heard.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.402
All right, I'm on it.

11:19.495 --> 11:21.638
Great.

11:24.426 --> 11:27.268
(gasping)

11:29.505 --> 11:31.915

11:31.933 --> 11:34.150

12:14.717 --> 12:16.459
Terry? Hey, there we go.

12:16.552 --> 12:18.628
-Terry, can you hear me?
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:18.721 --> 12:20.387
System shorted out.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.315
Couldn't make it to the door.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.616
Hmm.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.203
Okay.

12:33.979 --> 12:36.755
All right. (panting)

12:36.831 --> 12:38.982
-Can you hold yourself up?
-Yeah.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.650
All right.

12:40.743 --> 12:42.485

12:42.504 --> 12:44.679

Metro Dispatch is on fire.

13:40.303 --> 13:42.211
Why is this even in here?

13:42.213 --> 13:44.564
Okay. How long before you think
we can head back there

13:44.658 --> 13:46.566
and just tell them
we worked it all out?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.067
I have no idea.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.828
Okay, you know what?
We need a plan.

13:49.979 --> 13:52.831
Let me see if I can figure out
how to save the day again.

13:52.982 --> 13:55.316
And don't worry. You can take
all the credit again, too.

13:55.410 --> 13:58.986
Are you really seriously about
to throw another temper tantrum?

13:59.005 --> 14:02.715
-I did not throw a tantrum!
-Rockabye baby.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.253
Listen, we are now
in the quiet room,

14:07.405 --> 14:09.013
so you might want
to use this time

14:09.165 --> 14:10.849
to be alone
with your thoughts.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.910
So allow me
to provide you with one.

14:14.003 --> 14:15.745
You stood in the middle
of the floor

14:15.763 --> 14:18.247
yelling and lecturing me

14:18.266 --> 14:20.083
about not being a team player.

14:20.176 --> 14:22.360
And yet,
your panties are all in a bunch

14:22.529 --> 14:24.437
because you didn't get
the credit.

14:24.606 --> 14:26.772
Let me tell you something,
baby girl.

14:26.925 --> 14:29.534
There's no "I" in "team."

14:29.761 --> 14:31.619
Think about that.

14:40.105 --> 14:43.047
(sirens wailing)

14:52.117 --> 14:54.100
All right, guys,
let's get ready to go.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.879
Captain Shore.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.182
Captain Nash.
You're first on the scene.

15:01.217 --> 15:03.459
-BOBBY: Eddie.
-Records room
on the second floor

15:03.478 --> 15:04.977
is fully involved.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.072
Fire could spread to the third
floor. That's the main floor.

15:08.299 --> 15:11.968
Hen. The clean agent system
knocked him out for a second.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.319
He took in a lot of gas, but

15:13.413 --> 15:14.746
there could be
a lingering narcotic effect.

15:14.897 --> 15:16.305
-Okay, I got him.
-Okay, Hen, I want you

15:16.399 --> 15:17.916
to set up a triage area
in the parking garage next door.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.918
Copy that, Cap.
I'm gonna need a hand.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.753
It is Monday.

15:22.664 --> 15:23.996
Fine. You'll do.

15:24.165 --> 15:25.982
-Happy to help.
-HEN: All right, let's go.

15:26.075 --> 15:27.592
Jonah, take Meyers
and Ortiz with you.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.094
Okay. Come on, guys.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.492
What do you think?
Triage over there,

15:36.585 --> 15:38.344
so they could put
the command center here?

15:38.496 --> 15:40.438
-Yeah, works for me.
I'll get it rolling.
-Okay. Come on.

15:40.665 --> 15:42.515
So let's get these vehicles
removed.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.609
I want immediate,
minor and delayed over here,

15:44.760 --> 15:47.111
command post officers
and assistants over there.

15:47.263 --> 15:48.595
There's going to be a lot
of smoke inhalation,

15:48.690 --> 15:51.265
so stack up the O2 bottles
as the rescues respond in.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.434
And give me plenty of room
to work.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.495
I need my space.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.623
I want crews
at the Delta side, as well.

15:58.774 --> 16:01.459
Chimney, put together a team
from the 133, raise the ladders

16:01.536 --> 16:03.444
and start hitting
that corner window.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.687
Copy that.
Han, you're with me.

16:04.706 --> 16:06.280
Guess we're working together.
Should be fun.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.191
-Rookie, do everything
I tell you to do.
-Or not.

16:08.209 --> 16:10.468
Buck, Lucy, suit up.
You're going inside.

16:10.695 --> 16:12.470
You're gonna hit the fire
at the source on two.

16:12.547 --> 16:14.347
-Go.
-Go.

16:16.534 --> 16:19.227
(sighs)

16:24.058 --> 16:25.316
You're right.

16:25.468 --> 16:27.409
I wanted the credit.
The validation, I guess.

16:27.470 --> 16:31.138
And maybe it was me
being all Gen-Z, but

16:31.157 --> 16:34.050
I was trying
to stand up for everybody.

16:34.143 --> 16:37.144
You know, we don't do enough
of that in this world.

16:37.313 --> 16:39.622
That's kind of deep.

16:40.558 --> 16:41.390
For real.

16:41.409 --> 16:42.725
Hmm.

16:42.744 --> 16:44.651
-You should have read
my college essay.
-Wait.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.338
Why aren't you in college?

16:47.490 --> 16:48.673
Why do you care?

16:49.584 --> 16:50.758
Girl.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.419
I wasn't ready to go.

16:53.513 --> 16:58.741
I just needed more time,
but now I'm out of time,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.410
and USC sent me this letter,
and they want me to make

17:01.412 --> 17:06.065
my decision, and I'm still
trying to figure out what to do.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.584
(sighs)

17:08.603 --> 17:09.843
You should quit.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.454
Yeah, you would love that.

17:12.456 --> 17:14.681
No, I wouldn't.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.610
I told you once

17:17.762 --> 17:19.929
that I saw greatness in you.

17:20.022 --> 17:23.449
And you know I don't say
anything I don't mean.

17:23.601 --> 17:26.285
But maybe your greatness
is meant for something else.

17:26.437 --> 17:28.880
-Like what?
-I don't know.

17:29.031 --> 17:31.440
And you don't know, either.

17:31.534 --> 17:33.776
'Cause you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

17:33.795 --> 17:35.945
Get the hell out of here
and go to college.

17:35.963 --> 17:38.539
Hang around with some people
your own age.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.951
Fill your head
with some knowledge,

17:41.969 --> 17:45.730
and do some things.
Some crazy things,

17:45.957 --> 17:47.732
some courageous things,

17:47.959 --> 17:50.401
and maybe even
some naughty things.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.154
(both chuckle)

17:53.815 --> 17:58.484
Because... this job,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.486
it comes with a price,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.729
and it's a heavy one.

18:02.824 --> 18:08.402
And it's also one I never want
to see you have to pay.

18:08.496 --> 18:10.646
You know I'm right.

18:10.665 --> 18:12.406
Because you're always right.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.318
Yeah, and because
if you were sure

18:15.320 --> 18:18.487
you wanted to be a dispatcher
for the rest of your life,

18:18.506 --> 18:21.307
you'd have already thrown
that letter away.

18:23.995 --> 18:25.845
Captain Nash,
my people are initializing

18:25.939 --> 18:28.514
our disaster protocols, which
means they're gonna need help

18:28.666 --> 18:30.424
turning a sizable part
of that parking garage

18:30.518 --> 18:32.944
into a mobile dispatch center
so we can keep taking calls.

18:33.095 --> 18:35.688
-How's the volume?
-Oh, it's unusually high.

18:35.764 --> 18:39.008
There's no way that Valley can
handle all the traffic. (coughs)

18:39.026 --> 18:41.602
Contact Paramedic Greenway
from the 133 and coordinate

18:41.696 --> 18:44.013
-with him.
-Any of my people can
help you set up.

18:44.031 --> 18:45.681
Well, thank you.
Oh, I also have

18:45.700 --> 18:48.534
five of my senior dispatchers
still taking calls upstairs.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.187
Unless the fire's encroaching,
they won't stand down till

18:51.205 --> 18:52.279
we get the trunk line
connected.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.356
You said senior dispatchers.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.967
So May has been evacuated?

18:56.118 --> 18:57.376
She's still up there?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.195
I put her in the quiet room
with Claudette.

18:59.213 --> 19:01.973
I am so sorry. With all
this craziness, I forgot.

19:02.124 --> 19:04.049
-Where is this quiet room?
-It's on the third floor.

19:04.202 --> 19:05.810
-It's behind main dispatch.
-That's just above the source

19:05.961 --> 19:08.037
-of the fire.
-SUE: What?!
-Eddie, get some turnouts.

19:08.055 --> 19:09.872
Now. Go. Captain Shore,
I'm passing the baton.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.316
You're the new IC.
I'm going in.

19:16.805 --> 19:19.198
Why is Cap going in?

19:20.309 --> 19:22.535
May's still up there.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.554
Feels like
I'm missing something.

19:25.573 --> 19:27.239
Family history.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.167
Let's go.

19:30.395 --> 19:32.336
BOBBY: Donato, you're with me.
Eddie, you're with Buck.

19:32.563 --> 19:34.630
Let's hit it.

19:37.326 --> 19:39.719
Why it so hot in here?

19:40.663 --> 19:42.663
Yeah.

19:42.831 --> 19:45.099
-It's hotter on this side.
-Yeah.

19:46.577 --> 19:50.605
It feels like it's coming
from someplace over here.

19:55.010 --> 19:59.113
Something's wrong.
Something's very wrong.

20:06.764 --> 20:07.763
MAY:
Claudette, get back.

20:07.782 --> 20:10.023
(echoes):
Claudette, get back.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.210
Get back!

20:13.195 --> 20:14.453
(muttering):
I don't like fire.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.731
I don't like it.
I don't like fire.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.133
I don't like fire.

20:27.134 --> 20:28.375
TAYLOR:
If you're just joining us,

20:28.544 --> 20:29.802
the Downtown
Metro Dispatch Center

20:29.954 --> 20:32.045
has suffered some kind
of power surge

20:32.065 --> 20:33.880
which, as you can see,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.141
has sparked a fire
inside the building.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.051
Evacuations are in progress,

20:38.071 --> 20:39.628
although I'm hearing
that the danger

20:39.630 --> 20:43.315
has not spread to the
actual dispatch floor yet.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.968
(coughing) There's no way out
the other direction.

20:46.061 --> 20:47.470
(panting)

20:47.563 --> 20:49.655
Both hallways
are fully involved.

20:49.807 --> 20:51.807
But somebody's got
to be coming for us.

20:51.826 --> 20:54.977
Nobody's coming.
They can't save us.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.479
Claudette, we're in
the 911 call center.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.481
Someone should be
coming to find us.

20:58.574 --> 21:00.716
Okay, give me your jacket
so I can wet it.

21:01.819 --> 21:02.985
Come on! Give me your jacket.

21:03.078 --> 21:05.245
(coughing)

21:05.339 --> 21:07.348
Oh, my God. Claudette.

21:08.843 --> 21:11.560
I don't like fire.
(sniffles)

21:22.523 --> 21:24.840
-Sue, I'm fine now. I can help.
-Oh, good.

21:24.933 --> 21:27.451
So, I've reconciled the duty
roster and the visitor log.

21:27.603 --> 21:29.361
Everybody in the building
is accounted for

21:29.514 --> 21:31.196
except for May and Claudette.

21:31.349 --> 21:33.349
I know they're gonna
get them out of there.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.534
So, this is the only other name.
He signed in this morning.

21:35.703 --> 21:38.445
Carson. Yeah, he was installing
the clean agent system.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.856
When was the last time
you saw him?

21:40.949 --> 21:43.692
I don't remember.

21:43.861 --> 21:45.361
Okay, let's go.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.363
<i> SHORE:</i>
<i> This is Captain Shore.</i>

21:47.381 --> 21:49.048
<i> I need two firefighters</i>
<i> for search and rescue.</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:51.475
<i> Worker named Carson Hayes,</i>

21:51.702 --> 21:54.294
<i> last seen on level two,</i>
<i>could still be in the building.</i>

21:54.388 --> 21:56.205
This is Diaz.
Buckley and I<i> are</i> on two.

21:56.374 --> 21:57.815
We swept the whole floor.

21:57.966 --> 21:59.375
This is dispatcher Russo.

21:59.544 --> 22:00.893
<i> -I think I know where he is.</i>
-Go ahead, Josh.

22:01.045 --> 22:03.062
<i> He told me he was going</i>
<i> to the basement</i>

22:03.156 --> 22:04.380
to connect power to the system.

22:04.398 --> 22:06.157
It's probably
the electrical vault.

22:06.308 --> 22:07.900
I can meet you on two
and take you down there.

22:08.069 --> 22:09.994
Negative, we got this. Buck!

22:11.164 --> 22:12.404
-Take this for me.
-I got it.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.314
But I-I'm right
by the fire stairs.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.741
I-I could be
down there right away.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.835
Josh, you're a dispatcher,
not a firefighter.

22:17.986 --> 22:20.412
Today, you're a guest
in this house.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.989
He's been waiting months
to say that.

22:23.084 --> 22:24.842
SUE:
Captain Shore, good news.

22:24.993 --> 22:27.178
Mobile dispatch
is almost ready to go live.

22:27.405 --> 22:28.571
SHORE:
Maybe not that ready.

22:28.664 --> 22:30.089
Fire's broke through
to the third floor.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.590
That roof might be compromised.

22:31.759 --> 22:33.166
Along with that radio tower.

22:33.260 --> 22:34.743
SUE:
Well, that's our only connection

22:34.762 --> 22:36.929
to every truck, ladder
and ambulance in the city.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.414
And not just downtown.

22:38.432 --> 22:40.099
-Valley, too?
-All of it.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.842
SUE:
If that tower goes,
it doesn't matter

22:41.861 --> 22:43.194
how many calls we take.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.679
We can't send anyone
to rescue anyone anywhere.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.348
Han brothers, take this ladder,
reposition it to the roof.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.701
Take a team up there
and start venting it.

22:50.928 --> 22:53.186
-And secure that tower.
-Copy that.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.497
Albert.

23:01.455 --> 23:03.939
All right, Albert,
once I clear this area,

23:03.958 --> 23:06.592
-you're good to go!
-ALBERT: Copy that.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.612
CHIMNEY:
All right.

23:09.630 --> 23:13.707
Get me ventilation
here to there. Move!

23:13.726 --> 23:15.375
How we doing up there, Han?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.803
If we bind the straps
to the base of this tower,

23:17.955 --> 23:18.954
think we'll be golden.

23:19.047 --> 23:20.139
What do you think
about over there?

23:20.266 --> 23:22.791
CHIMNEY:
Sounds like a plan.

23:22.810 --> 23:24.960
Albert!

23:24.979 --> 23:26.311
-Albert.
-(grunts)

23:26.464 --> 23:28.239
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

23:28.390 --> 23:30.390
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

23:30.468 --> 23:33.469
You're not dizzy? Can you see?
How many of me are there?

23:33.487 --> 23:36.372
Thankfully just the one.
I couldn't handle more of you.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.417
(Claudette coughing)

23:39.585 --> 23:41.660
I don't know why
the sprinklers aren't on.

23:41.829 --> 23:45.314
-It's getting closer.
-You think it's gonna knock?

23:45.407 --> 23:49.760
It goes everywhere,
eats everything.

23:49.912 --> 23:52.078
-Claudette.
-Smells like meat.

23:52.173 --> 23:54.006
When it cooks you,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.583
and your-your blood burns, too.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.994
-That smells like copper.
-Claudette.

23:59.087 --> 24:01.830
Can't forget that smell.

24:01.849 --> 24:04.442
Sometimes I remember,

24:04.593 --> 24:07.111
comes out of nowhere.

24:07.262 --> 24:09.572
-Hits like a...
-(fire whooshes)

24:13.786 --> 24:15.077
(Claudette grunts)

24:16.180 --> 24:17.771
Claudette, listen to me.

24:17.865 --> 24:20.683
You didn't die then,
and you're not gonna die now.

24:20.701 --> 24:23.109
Don't worry, don't worry.
It only hurts for a sec.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.628
Then it takes
your nerve endings out.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.538
You won't feel a thing.
You won't--

24:26.632 --> 24:28.357
You won't feel a thing, o-okay?

24:28.526 --> 24:30.876
No, you won't feel it.
We won't feel it.

24:31.028 --> 24:32.386
We won't feel...

24:37.125 --> 24:39.393
LUCY:
Cap, we can't
get to them this way.

24:40.054 --> 24:41.562
(echoing):
Cap.

24:42.965 --> 24:46.400
Cap? What's the plan?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.217
EDDIE:
This way, this way, this way.

24:55.310 --> 24:57.369
Josh said he's
in the electrical vault.

24:58.222 --> 25:00.331
Okay. Here we are.

25:06.914 --> 25:09.048
Got him.

25:11.068 --> 25:13.919
-Carson?
-Yeah. How'd you know?

25:14.071 --> 25:15.738
Josh let us know
you're down here.

25:15.756 --> 25:18.182
-CARSON: Josh?
I'm glad he remembered.
-Let me guess.

25:18.409 --> 25:22.411
-Arc blast?
-Yeah. The suppression blanket
took the hit.

25:22.429 --> 25:23.854
I got too close.

25:24.006 --> 25:25.430
I crawled over here
to get my phone.

25:25.583 --> 25:26.840
Well, we're on no signal
down here.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.085
(screams)
My leg really hurts.

25:30.104 --> 25:31.770
BP is 130/80.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.863
Little high.
We're gonna give you

25:33.090 --> 25:34.106
something for the pain, Carson.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.200
-Should kick in soon.
-Oh, please.

25:36.277 --> 25:38.110
EDDIE:
I'm also gonna need to cut
through this pant leg.

25:38.262 --> 25:39.995
Do what you got to do.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.447
I gave up trying
to yell for help.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.266
-What's going on up there?
-BUCK: Uh, well,

25:44.359 --> 25:45.960
the building's on fire.

25:46.862 --> 25:47.936
Well, that's not embarrassing.

25:48.030 --> 25:49.213
Arc blast is not your fault.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.789
This is a very old building.

25:50.866 --> 25:53.717
Who knows what kind of faulty
wiring was down here?

25:53.944 --> 25:56.369
(grunts) Oh!

25:56.389 --> 25:57.721
Why did I tell you to do that?

25:57.873 --> 25:59.723
Hey, I know it looks bad,
but not a lot of blood.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.450
That's a good thing.

26:01.468 --> 26:02.801
Oh, isn't that always
a good thing?

26:02.895 --> 26:05.637
EDDIE:
(chuckles) You got me there.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.982
How's that morphine?

26:08.976 --> 26:10.359
Good.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.903
Okay, we're gonna splint this

26:13.130 --> 26:14.238
and we're gonna get you
out of here.

26:14.389 --> 26:16.073
Can they fix it,
or am I gonna be

26:16.300 --> 26:17.557
the next contestant

an entire fire truck

26:19.653 --> 26:22.228
fall on my leg,
and hey, look at me now.

26:22.356 --> 26:24.064
That sounds horrible.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.491
No, horrible was
the blood clots you get after.

26:26.644 --> 26:28.752
Mine was in my lung.
I was coughing up blood.

26:28.904 --> 26:31.980
-And they put you on
these blood thinners and...
-Buck.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.573

27:33.711 --> 27:35.727
Elderly man went out on a walk

27:35.880 --> 27:37.637
Wandered into Will Rogers Park,
can't find his way back.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.472
Any luck on a location?

27:39.492 --> 27:41.307

I'm gonna take you up on that.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.155
Oh, wait.

36:16.175 --> 36:19.551
Do we do background checks
when we hire contractors?

36:20.420 --> 36:22.512
Yes. They're quite extensive.

36:22.739 --> 36:24.764
Great.

36:30.430 --> 36:31.229
Hey.

36:32.599 --> 36:33.748
How are you feeling?

36:33.767 --> 36:35.692
Terrible at my job?

36:37.421 --> 36:40.438
-I think this whole thing
is my fault.
-Oh...

36:40.590 --> 36:41.423
Are you kidding?

36:41.441 --> 36:45.777
This building is... was ancient.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.038
We were due for an upgrade.

36:48.949 --> 36:50.932
Upgrades used to be
my specialty.

36:50.951 --> 36:53.293
There's no reason
why they still can't be.

36:59.367 --> 37:00.608
Hey.

37:00.702 --> 37:01.960
How you doing?

37:02.054 --> 37:04.462
Thought I lost you there
for a second.

37:04.614 --> 37:06.348
Me, too.

37:08.042 --> 37:10.785
You know how they say
your, uh, whole life

37:10.878 --> 37:13.288
flashes before your eyes?

37:13.306 --> 37:14.789
Mine kind of sucked.

37:14.882 --> 37:17.400
(laughs softly)

37:17.569 --> 37:18.735
Albert, I'm sorry.

37:18.962 --> 37:20.720
-Oh, it's not your fault.
-No, it was.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.314
-You never should've
been on that roof.
-Howard, it...

37:23.467 --> 37:26.726
You were trying to tell me
something the other day,

37:26.820 --> 37:29.037
and I wasn't ready to hear it.

37:31.733 --> 37:33.583
(sighs)
You know, me and Pop

37:33.693 --> 37:35.568
have never really had
a great relationship,

37:35.587 --> 37:38.255
and I know that he thinks me
being a firefighter

37:38.331 --> 37:41.149
is the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.409
It's not stupid.

37:43.503 --> 37:45.262
You're a hero.

37:48.325 --> 37:51.309
And you're my brother, so...

37:52.846 --> 37:57.065
...you looking up to me, wanting
to follow in my footsteps...

37:59.093 --> 38:01.111
...it meant the world to me,
you know?

38:04.932 --> 38:09.577
That's actually why I didn't
want to disappoint you so badly.

38:11.606 --> 38:14.516
Just wish I could be half
as good at this as you are.

38:14.576 --> 38:15.959
Hey, listen.

38:16.186 --> 38:19.779
Don't settle for being
half of anything, okay?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.631
Go out there and be something
that allows you

38:21.858 --> 38:23.341
to be a hundred percent you.

38:25.195 --> 38:27.012
What are you saying?

38:28.140 --> 38:32.050
I'm saying I love you.

38:32.202 --> 38:34.627
And I want you to quit.

38:34.721 --> 38:37.022
If that's what you want.

38:43.563 --> 38:45.563
(laughs)

38:45.715 --> 38:47.115
(exhales)

38:49.402 --> 38:51.069
This is silly. I feel
like I just pulled something.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.571
We will let
the MRI confirm that.

38:53.740 --> 38:55.314
Don't need an MRI,
just need some ibuprofen.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.225
-Is he kidding right now?
-No.

38:57.243 --> 38:59.410
He is a terrible patient.

38:59.563 --> 39:02.154
Look, you are getting that MRI,
even if I have to throw you

39:02.174 --> 39:04.399
in the machine
kicking and screaming.

39:04.492 --> 39:05.825
Listen, Sergeant...
(grunts)

39:05.844 --> 39:07.677
All right, all right.
I won't be doing any kicking.

39:07.904 --> 39:09.328
Exactly. A roof fell on you.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.680
I am fine.
This is not a big deal.

39:10.832 --> 39:12.665
It was to me.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.092
You saved my life.

39:14.186 --> 39:16.603
So please, get the damn MRI.

39:20.508 --> 39:22.250
Okay.

39:22.268 --> 39:24.435
Well, this is what I get
for disobeying your orders.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.679
You did tell me
not to go down there.

39:26.773 --> 39:30.116
I'm so glad you did, Papa Bear.

39:38.693 --> 39:40.359
Lucy Donato.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.361
-I'm Taylor...
-Taylor Kelly.

39:42.381 --> 39:45.364
Yeah. Heard a lot about you.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.092
Same.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.180
Uh, did you want a comment?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.059
You don't know
what the 118 means to him.

39:56.286 --> 39:57.710
I know all firefighters,

39:57.804 --> 40:00.713
they live together
and work together and...

40:00.732 --> 40:04.475
probably do feel like a family
some of the time.

40:04.628 --> 40:09.555
But for Buck,
that firehouse is his family.

40:10.558 --> 40:13.660
When things gets messy
at the 118, he falls apart.

40:14.988 --> 40:17.414
I'd hate for things
to get messy again.

40:26.149 --> 40:27.907
She's a peach.

40:28.001 --> 40:30.668
Hey, so, uh, he-he--
he's good, right?

40:30.820 --> 40:33.004
He had some pain
in his leg on the way in.

40:33.156 --> 40:34.914
-Might be a pinched nerve.
-Mm.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.824
Well, with all
that he's been through,

40:36.843 --> 40:38.159
he's lucky
that's all that it is.

40:38.178 --> 40:39.827
Yeah, I think a lot of people
got lucky today.

40:39.846 --> 40:41.679

40:41.831 --> 40:44.774

40:45.001 --> 40:46.776
-Give me something.
-Decompressions.

40:46.928 --> 40:48.169
-Wh...
-JONAH: I got her.

40:48.188 --> 40:49.337
HEN:
Jonah!

40:49.430 --> 40:51.281
-You're gonna make it!
-Jonah.

40:51.508 --> 40:53.191
-She coded in the ambulance.
-DOCTOR: What happened?

40:53.343 --> 40:56.119
Patient suffered cardiac arrest
en route. No pulse.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.529
-How long has she been down?
-12 minutes.

40:58.682 --> 41:01.365
DOCTOR:
Let's call it.

41:01.442 --> 41:03.376
(panting)

41:15.790 --> 41:18.549
Jonah, what happened?

41:18.643 --> 41:20.793
She was fine when I left triage.

41:20.870 --> 41:22.870
Pressure bottomed out.

41:22.964 --> 41:25.106
Couldn't get her rhythm back.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.392
It's weird.

41:28.545 --> 41:30.728
I should've been able
to save her.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.655
I usually save them.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.476
Hen.

41:37.570 --> 41:40.663
She was fine.
I-I don't understand.

41:44.894 --> 41:46.503
Neither do I.

41:46.654 --> 41:48.320
<i> It was weird.</i>

41:48.340 --> 41:51.966
It was weird, or he was weird?

41:53.512 --> 41:55.661
"I should have
been able to save her."

41:55.722 --> 41:57.013
That's what he said.

41:57.164 --> 42:00.350
Like she was
a math problem or...

42:00.501 --> 42:04.354
a missed point in a tennis match
and-and not a human being.

42:04.505 --> 42:07.598
Well, maybe that's just
how he packs it away.

42:07.751 --> 42:12.987
There's packing away
and there's throwing away.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.701
Look, you always say
that when you're out there,

42:18.928 --> 42:21.037
all you've got
is your instincts.

42:21.188 --> 42:24.958
And truth is,
you've never liked the guy.

42:25.860 --> 42:28.211
So maybe there's a reason why.

42:29.530 --> 42:31.589
I think there is.
