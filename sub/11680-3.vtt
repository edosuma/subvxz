<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>

00:02.127 --> 00:04.387
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:06.959
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

00:07.822 --> 00:10.026
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing...</i>

00:10.151 --> 00:12.333
<i>no cash, no credit, no job history.</i>

00:12.604 --> 00:14.979
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:15.104 --> 00:16.347
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.132 --> 00:19.248
<i>You do whatever work comes your way.</i>

00:20.146 --> 00:22.655
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.291 --> 00:25.648
- <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i>
- Should we shoot them?

00:25.926 --> 00:28.526
<i>An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.904
You know spies, a bunch of bitchy
little girls.

00:31.245 --> 00:33.323
- <i>Family, too</i>
- Is that your mom again?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.533
<i>- if you're desperate.</i>
- Someone needs your help.

00:35.974 --> 00:38.161
<i>Bottom line...
as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.547 --> 00:40.038
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

01:16.661 --> 01:18.285
Nate.
What are you doing here?

01:18.505 --> 01:21.205
Just giving you a little taste
of what I woke up to this morning.

01:21.575 --> 01:24.917
I was dragged out of bed by someone
very interested in you.

01:26.685 --> 01:28.825
Mr. Westen.
You mind if I come in?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.575
By all means.

01:33.783 --> 01:35.810
You know, if these visits
become a habit,

01:35.935 --> 01:37.817
I'm gonna start thinking
you like me.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.518
Remember my partner, Detective Lopez.
I'm not sure you two formally met.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.000
I'm glad you're here.
I got a gift for you.

01:48.125 --> 01:49.650
My daily activity log.

01:51.034 --> 01:52.538
We were just dropping Nate off.

01:52.663 --> 01:55.823
Just a way to say thank you for chatting
to us about his big brother.

01:56.091 --> 01:59.285
And I thought it wouldn't hurt to see if
you were free to answer some questions.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.494
I'm crazy busy.

02:00.715 --> 02:03.380
I need to finish my yogurt.
Then I was planning on working out.

02:03.505 --> 02:05.420
Well, until your calendar clears up,

02:05.545 --> 02:08.727
just know I'm gonna make my way
through every friend,

02:08.852 --> 02:10.920
relative, and associate you have.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.520
Let me save you some time. My friends
and family don't know anything.

02:14.645 --> 02:16.645
Sooner or later, someone will.

02:17.675 --> 02:19.555
When you want this to stop.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.245
How long you been in town?

02:27.605 --> 02:31.078
About 6 hours, 5 of which were spent
listening to your girlfriend over there

02:31.203 --> 02:34.278
tell me that I'd fled to Vegas
to avoid some unpaid parking tickets.

02:34.505 --> 02:37.323
She was just trying to soften you up,
trying to get you to flip on me.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.577
Yeah, I figured that out
after she said

02:39.702 --> 02:42.077
it would go easier
if I flipped on my brother.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.606
Jesus, bro,
I didn't say anything, all right?

02:45.731 --> 02:49.735
Do you know how hard it is not to talk
about your extracurricular activities?

02:50.656 --> 02:53.255
Drive me to mom's. My car is there.
I need to get to my meeting.

02:53.585 --> 02:55.320
- Meeting?
- Limos, bro.

02:55.445 --> 02:59.178
I came back to talk with investors
about expanding my company.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.705
This is real.

03:01.835 --> 03:04.360
Okay? Things are finally
breaking my way.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.559
Help me out?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.535
So, Nate didn't give her anything?

03:22.805 --> 03:25.704
If there's one thing Nate knows
how to do, it's avoid telling the truth.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.375
Well, that's good news for now.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.150
But how long before Paxson finds
someone you know that she can flip,

03:31.275 --> 03:34.755
- like a gun runner named Seymour?
- Or a money launder named Barry?

03:34.995 --> 03:36.757
Or a washed-up Navy Seal named Sam?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.802
- Or how about an unstable, jealous...
- Guys.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.132
If Paxson's going after
everyone I know,

03:42.257 --> 03:44.598
I need to get to know someone
she'll regret going after.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.310
Not a bad idea. Make it look like
you're mixed up with someone with clout,

03:48.478 --> 03:50.396
maybe somebody
from the mayor's office.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.649
I'm thinking
a financial relationship,

03:52.774 --> 03:56.574
something that looks very suspicious,
but isn't actually illegal.

03:56.865 --> 03:57.915
Sounds fun.

03:58.435 --> 03:59.535
Thanks, Sam.

03:59.755 --> 04:02.241
<i>The lone spy who always
works solo is a myth.</i>

04:02.755 --> 04:06.620
<i>The truth is, you don't last long
without keeping a few friends around,</i>

04:06.745 --> 04:09.123
<i>because your enemies
will find you on their own.</i>

04:10.470 --> 04:13.294
You wouldn't happen to know where
I could find a burned spy, would you?

04:13.462 --> 04:14.295
Brennen.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.719
That's my way of saying thank you
for the last time I saw you.

04:22.255 --> 04:24.105
Well, nice to see you, too.

04:24.405 --> 04:27.391
Although I thought you'd still be
running from those South Americans.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.150
You know, I would be,

04:29.275 --> 04:31.656
but it seems that a rival cartel

04:31.875 --> 04:35.357
got an anonymous shipment
of AK-47s and rocket launchers,

04:35.785 --> 04:37.935
so those angry South Americans
were a little busy,

04:38.060 --> 04:40.905
what with all the killing and dying.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.074
You financed a private war
so you could get back to Miami? Why?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.201
An exciting business opportunity.

04:46.690 --> 04:47.690
A limo company.

04:47.815 --> 04:50.789
Actually, I think
you might know the owner.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.292
Nate.
You're Nate's investor.

04:53.515 --> 04:55.377
But not just me. I have a partner.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.213
Nate's with him now.
Doesn't Nate look happy?

04:58.519 --> 04:59.798
Closing his little deal.

04:59.966 --> 05:04.094
But he doesn't realize that his investor
is an enforcer called "The Butcher".

05:04.262 --> 05:07.222
- Brought him over special for this.
- Brennen, if you...

05:08.105 --> 05:10.434
Michael, no.
It's not up to me.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.852
Whether Nate's meeting ends
in a bullet or a handshake

05:14.225 --> 05:15.731
is entirely up to you.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.146
You're gonna be running
some errands for me today.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.918
Just think of me as...

05:21.115 --> 05:22.315
your new boss.

05:35.155 --> 05:38.003
Cellphone, keys, wallet,
and your sunglasses.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.475
I want to see those pretty eyes.

05:42.515 --> 05:43.515
Let's go.

05:43.875 --> 05:47.120
You're certainly in a hurry.
Is this job of yours time-sensitive?

05:47.245 --> 05:48.600
Listen to you.

05:49.196 --> 05:52.889
Probing for intel from the get-go.
You are a sly one, aren't you?

05:53.014 --> 05:55.620
You could save me some time.
You could tell me what we're doing.

05:56.434 --> 05:58.270
Pass.
You're just a key, Michael.

05:58.395 --> 06:00.970
Keys don't need to know
what's behind the doors they unlock.

06:01.095 --> 06:04.280
Now, rules for the superspy.
I give orders, you obey.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.198
You try to escape, Nate dies.

06:06.555 --> 06:08.805
Fail to complete a task, Nate dies.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.050
- Refuse an order...
- I get it.

06:11.175 --> 06:13.510
But I'm not playing fetch
until I know Nate's okay.

06:13.635 --> 06:15.791
Michael, we covered this.
The picture?

06:16.135 --> 06:19.837
That could have been taken hours ago.
Prove Nate's alive, or this ends here.

06:20.045 --> 06:23.716
Well, how about this? You stop
making demands, or your life ends here.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.843
<i>Your first priority
when you're captured</i>

06:26.085 --> 06:28.595
<i>is to make it clear
that your cooperation isn't free.</i>

06:28.895 --> 06:31.890
<i>Your captor gets what he wants
if you get what you want.</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:34.430
- Get in the car.
- You're the one stopping me.

06:34.555 --> 06:36.353
Prove to me I'm not wasting my time.

06:37.705 --> 06:41.442
<i>In any healthy relationship,
there needs to be some give and take.</i>

06:41.825 --> 06:43.648
- One word...
- And Nate dies.

06:44.185 --> 06:45.529
Not right away, of course.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.490
My partner is a man
who really enjoys his work.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.028
Yeah, it's me.
Put our friend on.

06:55.475 --> 06:56.625
It's for you.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.793
- This is Nate.
- <i>Nate Westen, Simon Davis.</i>

06:59.961 --> 07:01.793
Simon, my man.
Hey, you heading over?

07:02.215 --> 07:05.674
I have errands to run, but you can work
out the broad strokes with my partner.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.011
Be careful, though, he can be ruthless
once he starts to work you over.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.935
Yeah, no, I'm looking forward
to the challenge.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.370
- Good, buddy. I'll see you soon.
- <i>All right.</i>

07:14.495 --> 07:16.310
Happy? Now, get in the damn car.

07:23.415 --> 07:26.445
This is the house where
the Michael Westen grew up, huh?

07:27.235 --> 07:29.448
And now you're living here.
With his mom?

07:29.616 --> 07:32.913
I'm just crashing here for a while.
I'm just helping out with some repairs.

07:33.038 --> 07:34.488
It's not like that.

07:34.956 --> 07:38.320
- You got here fast, Barry.
- My salon's in the neighborhood, so...

07:38.445 --> 07:40.250
Anyway, so Michael's got
a cop problem?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.711
Yeah, it's making life unpleasant
for all of us.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.530
- We need help to make it go away.
- Okay, well, tiny issue, all right?

07:46.655 --> 07:48.876
My life coach has strongly suggested

07:49.001 --> 07:51.095
that I try and avoid
stressful situations.

07:51.435 --> 07:53.678
Barry, we're not asking you
to storm the station.

07:53.803 --> 07:56.018
Just open a joint bank account
with Mike...

07:56.435 --> 07:58.143
And a mayor's aide.

08:00.285 --> 08:02.957
Great. Why don't we just throw
a judge in there while we're at it?

08:03.082 --> 08:05.067
We called because
she isn't just our problem.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.610
She's interrogating
everybody in Mike's life.

08:07.735 --> 08:11.406
You wanna find out the questions she has
for his money-laundering pal Barry?

08:13.995 --> 08:15.892
Here's what you're gonna do.

08:16.505 --> 08:18.839
Go here and tell Fabian

08:19.355 --> 08:21.959
that I'm giving you
the portable skimmer.

08:23.105 --> 08:24.105
Fabian?

08:24.895 --> 08:26.295
I hired an intern.

08:27.255 --> 08:29.341
Once your pretty little hands
swipe that card...

08:30.695 --> 08:33.261
my pretty little hands are gonna do
some financial magic.

08:35.275 --> 08:38.020
Say, Barry,
before you and your hands get too busy,

08:38.145 --> 08:40.977
I thought you could help me out
with a little home-improvement project.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.865
- So who's the guy with the purse?
- That's Barry.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.535
What does he do?

08:50.055 --> 08:52.555
He's Sam's financial consultant.

08:55.315 --> 08:57.703
Now you got to hold it up.
Hold it in position.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.455
I got to put this thing up.
Hold that down.

09:08.124 --> 09:09.750
- We're here.
- Where's "here"?

09:09.875 --> 09:13.770
See the building? There's a hardware key
in a desk in office 237.

09:13.895 --> 09:16.305
In about a half an hour,
it's gonna be in my pocket.

09:18.813 --> 09:20.225
This gets you past security.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.645
Besides the guards, there should be
nobody in the building on a Sunday.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.565
I hope you know more
about the building than my jacket size.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.319
Superspy, you got bigger things
to worry about than how pretty you look.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.613
The offices are wired
to the building's alarms.

09:33.635 --> 09:35.616
- You ready?
- How long do I have inside?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.578
If you're not gonna tell me
what we're doing here...

09:40.955 --> 09:43.457
Just eat what's on your plate.

09:45.305 --> 09:46.555
One more thing.

09:46.925 --> 09:48.230
While you're in there,

09:48.355 --> 09:51.100
phone a friend, write an e-mail,
update your facebook status.

09:51.225 --> 09:52.825
I honestly don't care.

09:52.950 --> 09:55.093
As long as you remember
what really matters here.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.661
I don't get what I want,
and your brother dies.

09:58.785 --> 09:59.806
Now, run along.

10:31.265 --> 10:34.591
<i>Spies are trained to use
whatever resources are available.</i>

10:34.759 --> 10:37.370
<i>In the hills of Afghanistan,
the best you can hope for</i>

10:37.495 --> 10:39.388
<i>are rocks and some scrub brush.</i>

10:40.025 --> 10:43.016
<i>In an office building,
you may have more options.</i>

10:45.235 --> 10:47.885
<i>Technology that makes
communication easier</i>

10:48.795 --> 10:51.245
<i>also tends to make it
more vulnerable.</i>

10:51.715 --> 10:54.194
<i>The bluetooth on a cellphone,
for example,</i>

10:54.362 --> 10:58.721
<i>is an easy way to send information
wirelessly over short distances.</i>

11:03.204 --> 11:07.208
<i>Use an antenna, and you can get that
same information over longer distances.</i>

11:07.545 --> 11:10.168
<i>If you don't have an antenna,
you can build your own.</i>

11:10.655 --> 11:13.990
<i>A combination of metal washers
and a bent coat hanger</i>

11:14.115 --> 11:18.010
<i>connected to a cylindrical chip scan

11:18.135 --> 11:21.722
<i>A USB cable transmits

11:22.115 --> 11:23.598
<i>Add a few pencils for legs,</i>

11:23.766 --> 11:26.822
<i>and you've got a cute
little improvised hacking device.</i>

11:48.485 --> 11:50.253
- What?
- Hey, watch that window.

11:50.378 --> 11:51.630
If anything goes wrong,

11:51.755 --> 11:54.170
I'll knock it out and throw
the hardware key down to you.

11:54.295 --> 11:56.245
Fine.
Just hurry up, Westen.

12:13.655 --> 12:16.855
- What was that?
- Nothing, just part of the process.

12:17.073 --> 12:20.030
You're gonna have to start bringing
the second man to this two-man job.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.199
Sam! What, did you break it?

12:22.367 --> 12:25.410
No, no, no, it's fine.
Very sturdy wood and glass.

12:30.205 --> 12:32.310
I don't have a lot of time.
Remember Brennen?

12:32.435 --> 12:35.130
Yeah, the arms dealer.
Liked to strap bombs to kids.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.602
Yeah, he's back,
and he's threatening to kill Nate

12:37.727 --> 12:40.425
unless I steal something for him,
some kind of high-tech equipment.

12:41.355 --> 12:43.929
Why don't you show Maddie our progress,
and I'll be right back?

12:46.365 --> 12:49.807
- Are you okay? Is Nate okay?
- I'm fine. Nate was 35 minutes ago.

12:49.932 --> 12:51.660
- That's all I know.
- What can I do?

12:51.785 --> 12:54.800
I just hacked Brennen's cell.
I e-mailed you everything on it.

12:54.925 --> 12:57.943
You need to comb through the addresses,
text messages, and phone calls.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.585
- You wanna know what he's after?
- I wanna know everything.

13:00.710 --> 13:03.087
I wanna know who his buyer is,
where he's got Nate,

13:03.212 --> 13:05.194
what orange juice
he drinks in the morning.

13:05.319 --> 13:06.886
- <i>I'm on it.</i>
- You better hurry,

13:07.011 --> 13:10.664
'cause I get the feeling Brennen's got
the Westen  fitted for body bags.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.570
<i>Nothing sells innocence
like an injury.</i>

13:45.695 --> 13:49.045
<i>People naturally sympathize
with someone who's bleeding.</i>

13:50.345 --> 13:53.620
<i>If you're in a situation where
you need the benefit of the doubt,</i>

13:53.745 --> 13:55.495
<i>it's worth a flesh wound.</i>

14:11.445 --> 14:12.923
What the hell did you do?

14:14.225 --> 14:16.521
I was moving the rack,
and it fell into the window.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.523
- It just tipped over.
- Yeah, I was...

14:18.648 --> 14:22.652
The squeegee blade fell, and I went
to get it, and I hit it, and it fell.

14:23.125 --> 14:26.458
- Are you trying to pull something?
- No. Come on, man, I...

14:26.583 --> 14:28.742
The blade came off, and it fell.

14:29.605 --> 14:31.155
Rick, kill the alarm.

14:31.665 --> 14:34.987
- Did you go into that office?
- No, I only do the hallways, so I...

14:36.915 --> 14:38.460
What the hell is this?

14:38.585 --> 14:40.504
I was picking up glass,
and I cut myself.

14:40.865 --> 14:43.490
- Okay, what's your name?
- Johnny. John Dickson.

14:43.615 --> 14:46.927
And I do the windows. And I'm gonna get
a vacuum and I'm gonna clean this up.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.340
Johnny, no.
You're gonna stay right here.

14:49.465 --> 14:52.470
Whenever there's an alarm, we have
to call the police. Building procedure.

14:52.595 --> 14:55.349
You don't have to do that.
No, listen, you don't have to do that!

14:55.474 --> 14:58.324
- It's simple glass! It fell!
- Are you drunk?

15:01.018 --> 15:03.026
Don't lie to me.
I can smell it on you.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.262
Wait. Just hold on, please?

15:06.079 --> 15:07.447
This job is all I got,

15:07.734 --> 15:09.990
and if I miss
a child-support payment,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.878
my ex will take the kids
to Flagstaff with her boyfriend.

15:13.003 --> 15:14.027
I messed up.

15:16.459 --> 15:17.709
And I am sorry.

15:17.935 --> 15:21.393
But I'll make it right
if you just let this one slide.

15:21.518 --> 15:23.672
Look,
you call somebody to pick you up.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
Thank you.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.270
Thank you.

15:39.004 --> 15:39.854
So?

15:46.371 --> 15:47.404
What's next?

15:54.486 --> 15:57.580
<i>In the adrenaline rush
of a high-stress situation,</i>

15:57.750 --> 15:59.158
<i>you tend to miss details.</i>

15:59.375 --> 16:02.249
<i>But it's the little things
that make all the difference.</i>

16:02.374 --> 16:04.960
You keep looking at me that way,
you'll have to buy me dinner.

16:05.085 --> 16:05.846
Sig 226.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.208
That's an impressive
piece of hardware.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.234
It is.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.841
What's that tell you about me?

16:10.966 --> 16:13.346
That I feel the need
to appear powerful

16:13.514 --> 16:15.984
and intimidating?
I see you're still a sharp dresser.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.475
Is that Brioni?

16:17.643 --> 16:20.221
Come on. Now,
what is that gonna tell you about me?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.521
It's already well established
I like nice things.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.782
And pretty things.

16:23.907 --> 16:25.891
Who gave you the tie pin?
Your wife?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.368
Married? Please.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.413
And enough with the digging.
You're boring me.

16:40.851 --> 16:42.459
Here's how this is gonna work.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.755
The guy in that house has a voice.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.061
You have a voice recorder.
You're gonna put the two together.

16:48.186 --> 16:49.863
You want to be more specific?

16:49.988 --> 16:52.761
Do you want his favorite bible verses,
freestyle rap?

16:52.929 --> 16:56.389
- Full name, every number, 0 through 9.
- Someone's making a voice key.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.642
Ding, ding, Michael Westen.

16:58.831 --> 17:00.681
His name's Jonathan Carver, a man

17:00.853 --> 17:03.188
with the right clearance
at the right company, a employee

17:03.356 --> 17:05.607
who doesn't have a family, a dog,
or an ADT account.

17:05.928 --> 17:07.525
Thanks for making it easy on me.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.861
Actually,
I understand he's a bit of a gun nut,

17:10.030 --> 17:12.018
which means he's less likely
to call the cops

17:12.143 --> 17:14.449
and more likely to just shoot you.

17:15.019 --> 17:16.669
So good luck with that.

17:17.034 --> 17:18.632
Do you have a car-repair kit?

17:23.093 --> 17:25.843
<i>A tire iron is great
if you need a new tire.</i>

17:26.462 --> 17:28.182
<i>It's also great if you need a car,</i>

17:28.307 --> 17:31.049
<i>because a tire iron
can be used to break a window</i>

17:37.051 --> 17:40.707
<i>and pry open the steering column
to expose the ignition leads.</i>

17:40.832 --> 17:43.082
<i>It's the ultimate all-purpose tool.</i>

18:09.945 --> 18:11.647
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.971
This cat ran right in front of me.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.723
The cat cost you 2 grand.

18:20.082 --> 18:22.282
At least.
Look at this damage.

18:23.206 --> 18:24.216
Oh, man.

18:24.898 --> 18:28.523
I left my wallet in my jacket at home,
and the insurance card is in my wallet.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.094
- Are you trying to get out of this?
- No, man.

18:31.219 --> 18:33.773
I'll call my insurance company,
and they'll totally have my...

18:34.348 --> 18:35.171
my info...

18:35.296 --> 18:37.072
And I left my cellphone
in my jacket.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.086
- Can I use...
- You can use mine.

18:40.332 --> 18:41.882
That's great, thanks.

18:42.962 --> 18:44.481
Do you have pen and paper?

18:52.394 --> 18:53.744
Phone's in there.

18:54.835 --> 18:57.264
You sure do buy a lot of guns, Mr...

18:57.708 --> 19:00.013
I don't buy guns.
I make them.

19:00.313 --> 19:03.182
What's this one here, a .357?
You make this one?

19:03.351 --> 19:04.801
It's a .45, and no.

19:06.831 --> 19:09.881
- What about this little tiny one?
- It's a Ruger.

19:10.219 --> 19:13.509
- But what kind of bullets does it use?
- I thought you wanted to use the phone.

19:14.259 --> 19:16.696
You're an engineer of guns?
Where'd you go? M.I.T.?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.198
State.

19:18.675 --> 19:20.867
I was at the U of M.
I graduated

19:21.035 --> 19:22.020
1.9 GPA.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.204
- What'd you have, like a 4.0?
- 3 something.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.930
- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3?
- 3.9. What does it matter?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.244
Do you want me to get the phone?

19:29.653 --> 19:32.957
Let me get your name first,
and then before I call them...

19:33.082 --> 19:34.382
Jonathan Carver.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.207
What's that, Mr. Carpenter?

19:36.332 --> 19:38.732
It's Carver,
and it's three-oh-five...

19:38.857 --> 19:40.157
Three-zero-five?

19:40.848 --> 19:41.805
Three-oh-five.

19:42.105 --> 19:43.793
You mean three-zero-five?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.690
Yes, three-zero-five!

19:45.815 --> 19:47.393
Will you stop interrupting me?

19:47.561 --> 19:48.978
Sure. Thanks.

19:51.667 --> 19:52.793
So what's that?

19:52.918 --> 19:54.935
That is
an international transfer charge.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.278
- That means Brennen's moved money...
- Wait.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.531
- It's me.
<i>- What's Brennen got you doing?</i>

19:59.701 --> 20:03.437
I just finished stealing a hardware key
with an agency routing code.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.453
And now?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.327
Now, I'm hanging out with a gun designer
named Jonathan Carver,

20:08.452 --> 20:10.083
collecting numbers for a voice key.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.794
Sounds like Brennen's after
some government-funded weapon.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.838
How are we doing
with Brennen's phone?

20:15.006 --> 20:18.107
Could be better.
I mean, it's less than a week old.

20:18.232 --> 20:20.046
I mean,
this weasel's pretty careful.

20:20.171 --> 20:22.846
Deletes his text messages.
There's no contacts list, either.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.961
- What about his call log?
- Call log.

20:25.086 --> 20:27.840
So, there, I think we got
a little bit of good news.

20:27.965 --> 20:32.047
Brennen placed a bunch of calls to
Hamstead Bank and Trust.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.650
- <i>He used his phone to enter his pin.</i>
- So Barry got into his account?

20:36.543 --> 20:39.064
Brennen's moving a lot of money,
mostly to

20:39.189 --> 20:42.880
other banks, some numbered accounts,
and a company called...

20:43.422 --> 20:44.732
Onyx International.

20:44.857 --> 20:46.106
Barry's working on it.

20:46.231 --> 20:48.371
<i>Look for any rent
or mortgage payments.</i>

20:48.539 --> 20:51.670
If Brennen's got a place in Miami,
there's a good bet Nate's there.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.731
What are you trying to pull?

20:53.856 --> 20:56.706
That sure as hell ain't
your insurance company.

21:01.368 --> 21:03.359
<i>One great thing
about stealing information</i>

21:03.484 --> 21:05.274
<i>is that nobody knows it's gone.</i>

21:05.399 --> 21:07.840
<i>Steal someone's purse,
and you're probably in</i>

21:07.965 --> 21:09.231
<i>for a lot of screaming.</i>

21:09.356 --> 21:11.207
<i>But steal
someone's credit-card number,</i>

21:11.332 --> 21:13.240
<i>and half the time they thank you.</i>

21:13.365 --> 21:14.883
How was your meal?

21:17.234 --> 21:18.792
Let me take this for you.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.071
I'm sorry.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.933
I know you're not our waitress,

21:24.058 --> 21:25.908
but my friend's in a hurry.

21:26.033 --> 21:27.583
Can I give it to you?

21:32.795 --> 21:34.045
Fi, where you been?

21:34.251 --> 21:35.251
Skimming.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.254
- I got the debit card info from...
- I need you to meet me right now.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.422
What? Why?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.927
We got a situation.
Mike's in trouble.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.408
How soon can you meet me
at 115 Island?

21:49.059 --> 21:50.336
I'll be there in 10.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.423
I don't know who you are.

22:05.548 --> 22:08.034
I don't know what you're doing.
But you're done lying to me.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.620
<i>Involving civilians
in operations is dangerous,</i>

22:10.788 --> 22:12.163
<i>but sometimes necessary.</i>

22:12.331 --> 22:13.708
I want 2 grand in cash,

22:13.833 --> 22:15.917
and your car stays right here
until I get it.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.085
Hang on!

22:17.503 --> 22:20.587
<i>When it happens, you do what you can
to keep the civilian out of harm's way.</i>

22:21.100 --> 22:24.884
You know, this is your fault
just as much as it is mine.

22:25.052 --> 22:28.469
<i>That said, you try a little harder
with some civilians than others.</i>

22:28.594 --> 22:29.944
Look at your car!

22:30.156 --> 22:32.488
That car is 8 inches from the curb,

22:32.613 --> 22:34.956
and it's supposed to only be
6 inches from the curb!

22:35.081 --> 22:36.886
What are you talking about?
6 inches?

22:37.011 --> 22:39.217
Look at your car!
It's in the middle of the street!

22:39.342 --> 22:41.317
Look at it!
And you're getting in my face?

22:41.782 --> 22:44.060
It is supposed to only be 6 inches
from the curb!

22:44.185 --> 22:46.114
Say it's 8 inches from the curb!
Say it!

22:50.494 --> 22:51.789
- Get off me!
- I will!

22:51.914 --> 22:54.195
I'll get off of you when you admit it!
Just admit it.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.249
Your car is 8 inches from the curb.
Say it.

22:57.257 --> 22:58.743
I'll let you go if you say it.

22:58.868 --> 23:00.795
Your car is 8 inches from the curb.
Say it!

23:00.963 --> 23:02.903
All right!
It's 8 inches, all right?

23:03.028 --> 23:04.802
- What?
- It's 8 inches from the curb,

23:04.927 --> 23:07.477
- you crazy son of a bitch!
- Thank you.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.506
<i>It's 8 inches from the curb,
you crazy son of a bitch!</i>

23:14.077 --> 23:15.844
Quite the performance.
How'd we do?

23:15.969 --> 23:17.538
Great, but we need to go.

23:17.897 --> 23:18.897
Now.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.858
JLA Industries?

23:31.535 --> 23:34.037
You're forcing me to break
into a weapons manufacturer.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.105
Forcing.
Such an ugly word.

23:36.232 --> 23:37.332
Encouraging?

23:37.608 --> 23:38.750
Incentivizing?

23:39.329 --> 23:41.425
No, you're right,
let's go with forcing.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.465
Anyway, there's a box

23:43.590 --> 23:46.111
in R&D lab 422.

23:46.236 --> 23:47.736
Gray, about yea big.

23:48.691 --> 23:50.470
- Go fetch.
- What's in the box?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.532
For our purposes,
it couldn't matter less.

23:52.657 --> 23:54.675
If you want me to go,
it couldn't matter more.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.726
Anything could be in that box.
I'm not handing over a nuke

23:58.069 --> 23:59.352
to save one life,

23:59.521 --> 24:01.029
even if it is my brother's.

24:01.296 --> 24:02.496
You want me to fetch,

24:02.621 --> 24:05.108
you'll tell me what's in the box
and where it's headed.

24:05.233 --> 24:06.755
I'm pretty sure I can get you

24:06.880 --> 24:08.905
to go get it
without telling you a damn thing.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.227
- Yeah, what's up?
- Put him on.

24:17.921 --> 24:19.797
Hey, Mr. Davis.
How's it going?

24:19.922 --> 24:21.732
Hey, Nate. Good, good.

24:21.857 --> 24:24.298
Listen, I had a question for you.

24:24.641 --> 24:27.339
Are you one of those people
who agrees to see a job through

24:27.508 --> 24:29.420
- and then reneges?
<i>- Of course not.</i>

24:29.545 --> 24:30.735
Is there a problem?

24:30.921 --> 24:34.077
No. It's just I hate working
with people like that.

24:34.202 --> 24:36.349
It makes me crazy.
It's just one of those things.

24:37.146 --> 24:38.888
It makes me want to kill someone.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.625
Mr. Davis, trust me,
I wouldn't waste your time. Or mine.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.748
Good, good.

24:44.873 --> 24:47.125
Because I take my agreements
very seriously,

24:47.681 --> 24:50.779
and I like working with people
who do the same. Life is too short.

24:52.104 --> 24:54.017
Life is too short.

24:55.436 --> 24:57.336
Could you put my partner on?

25:00.972 --> 25:03.219
- What do you want me to do?
- Stay on the line.

25:03.344 --> 25:06.446
We're deciding whether little brother
lives through the phone call.

25:08.593 --> 25:09.549
Mr. Westen?

25:10.999 --> 25:12.849
I love my brother, Brennen.

25:13.689 --> 25:15.972
But there's one thing
that gets me into that building.

25:16.360 --> 25:19.880
<i>The problem with blackmail is that
it's like a gun with only one bullet.</i>

25:20.005 --> 25:22.662
<i>You can't waste that bullet
on every little problem.</i>

25:22.787 --> 25:25.022
<i>And the closer you get
to your goal, </i>

25:25.190 --> 25:27.540
<i>the harder it is
to pull the trigger.</i>

25:34.347 --> 25:37.160
- Keep him busy. I'll call you later.
- Right.

25:40.481 --> 25:43.416
Don't flatter yourself, Westen.
It's not a nuke.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.684
It's a biometric lock
for advanced infantry weapons.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.094
People will go on killing each other
in little wars all around the globe

25:51.219 --> 25:52.876
whether or not you steal it.

25:53.001 --> 25:55.636
The only difference is
how much money I make while they do it.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.531
Fine. I do this,

25:58.028 --> 26:01.517
Nate is released unhurt,
and I never see you again.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.501
Done.

26:02.626 --> 26:06.105
An hour from now, I'm a guy who sends
you mean-spirited Christmas cards.

26:06.580 --> 26:09.141
- What am I looking at in there?
- A two-man security team.

26:09.266 --> 26:11.622
You can't go around them.
You've got to go through them.

26:11.746 --> 26:14.128
Looks like I'll need
that tire iron again.

26:14.253 --> 26:16.603
I like where your head is at,
Westen.

26:26.510 --> 26:29.795
<i>If you had to choose
an ideal environment for guerilla war,</i>

26:30.310 --> 26:33.874
<i>it would probably look a lot like
an urban parking structure.</i>

26:36.251 --> 26:38.260
<i>It's an easy place
to create a distraction</i>

26:38.430 --> 26:40.056
<i>and draw out opposing forces.</i>

26:40.405 --> 26:41.432
Check that out.

26:51.903 --> 26:55.029
<i>A parking garage is also
a great place to control visibility</i>

26:56.573 --> 26:58.623
<i>and give yourself an advantage.</i>

27:00.754 --> 27:02.089
<i>And once you do that,</i>

27:02.214 --> 27:04.789
<i>you can find cover
and stage an effective ambush.</i>

27:06.127 --> 27:08.292
Don't struggle.
I don't want to hurt you.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.095
Hello?

27:19.528 --> 27:22.067
- <i>Security. Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah, I work on the third floor,

27:22.192 --> 27:25.230
and I'm trying to get to my car
in the garage, but the power is out.

27:25.355 --> 27:28.145
One guard went into the electrical room,
but it's been a while,

27:28.313 --> 27:29.855
<i>and it's still dark down here.</i>

27:30.115 --> 27:32.415
- I'll be right there.
- Thank you.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.738
Yeah, just got here.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.074
362, Burton Drive.

27:41.895 --> 27:43.452
Well, fingers crossed.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.623
Nate better be here.
Barry has run out of addresses to check.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.534
Second story, back door.
That's our way in.

27:59.955 --> 28:00.955
Charlie?

28:03.235 --> 28:04.335
You in here?

28:13.485 --> 28:14.885
Charlie, you in...

28:18.345 --> 28:20.718
Yeah, that move only works
before you're in a choke hold.

28:20.843 --> 28:21.893
Just relax.

28:22.018 --> 28:23.743
Just relax.
Go to sleep.

28:24.705 --> 28:25.805
Night-night.

28:37.785 --> 28:38.935
Ladies first.

28:44.245 --> 28:45.945
Someone's been shopping.

29:16.935 --> 29:18.335
Nate was here, Fi.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.426
We just missed him.
This beer is still cold.

29:27.375 --> 29:28.882
- Yeah, Mike?
- Where are you?

29:29.007 --> 29:31.190
- <i>We're at Brennen's.</i>
- Did you find Nate?

29:31.315 --> 29:32.554
Bad news, Mike.

29:32.679 --> 29:35.192
- Nate was here, but he's gone now.
- We're out of time, Sam.

29:35.317 --> 29:37.506
Look, this is not over.
I'll call Barry again.

29:37.631 --> 29:40.629
<i>We'll check for any addresses we might
have missed. We're gonna find him.</i>

29:40.754 --> 29:41.654
Nate!

29:44.205 --> 29:45.908
Don't bother, Sam. I just did.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.974
Doing deals over the phone
is so impersonal.

29:51.099 --> 29:53.624
Seriously, it's not a problem.
You know, I feel the same way.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.794
If we're gonna be business partners,
we got to get to know each other.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.980
You know what I mean?
We got to be...

29:59.105 --> 30:01.955
Like brothers?
Is that what you were thinking?

30:03.055 --> 30:04.719
- What's he doing here?
- You know,

30:04.844 --> 30:07.721
I'll bet Michael's thinking
the same thing about you.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.392
- What?
- You see, it's always at the end,

30:11.560 --> 30:14.645
when everything's coming together, that
people start making desperate moves.

30:14.925 --> 30:17.875
Nate, you're here to discourage
stupid decisions

30:18.195 --> 30:20.901
and to show that
I don't make idle threats.

30:22.105 --> 30:24.071
- You're good right there.
- My arm.

30:25.715 --> 30:27.700
- Stay still. Stay still.
- Calm down.

30:27.955 --> 30:30.130
I used one of those
nifty frangible rounds.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.880
A lot of soft-tissue damage,
but it doesn't usually kill.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.560
- You didn't need to do that.
- Actually, I did.

30:35.685 --> 30:37.485
It's called a countermove.

30:37.955 --> 30:40.171
You just had to know
what was in the box,

30:40.339 --> 30:43.089
so I just had to show you
who was in charge.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.136
Now, assuming you can read a map,

30:47.475 --> 30:50.431
just follow that red line
right to my new beach house.

30:50.795 --> 30:53.142
Hardware key gets you
into the R&D area.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.429
Carver's voice recognition
gets you into the lab.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.438
I cut it 
while you were with the guards.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.107
He needs to get to a hospital.
You nicked an artery.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.537
His needs will be met
just as soon as mine are.

31:02.685 --> 31:03.685
I promise.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.451
Oh, and, Westen, don't dawdle.
Otherwise, I'm switching to lead.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.655
<i>Jonathan Carver.
Seven-One-Three-Four-Eight.</i>

31:43.695 --> 31:46.403
- Mike, what happened?
- Brennen brought Nate and shot him.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.446
Shot him?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.269
- Jesus, is he...
- No, he's hurt bad.

31:50.394 --> 31:53.144
It was just Brennen's version
of a pep talk.

31:53.847 --> 31:56.874
If we don't find something against him,
I'll have to give him what he wants.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.250
You give him what he wants,
he'll kill you both.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.186
I'm running out of options, Sam.
Is there anything that we missed?

32:02.311 --> 32:03.961
Nothing good. You know,

32:04.775 --> 32:07.513
most of Brennen's bank records
point to some North African buyer,

32:07.638 --> 32:09.810
so, unless you're planning
a trip to Cairo...

32:09.935 --> 32:10.935
What else?

32:11.060 --> 32:13.180
<i>A few LLCs,
haven't been touched in years.</i>

32:13.585 --> 32:15.099
This Onyx International,

32:15.267 --> 32:17.617
<i>some S Corp,
looks like a tax shelter.</i>

32:17.742 --> 32:19.311
Tell me about Onyx International.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.171
Well, it's more like a Russian
nesting doll than a company.

32:22.296 --> 32:25.374
You know, I dug through
nine subsidiaries in six countries.

32:25.499 --> 32:28.670
All I got was "Belle Anna Holding"
out of Zurich.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.200
- He sends 40k every 6 months.
- A lot of work to hide 80 grand a year.

32:33.369 --> 32:36.020
No kidding. There's no business records,
either, for Belle Anna.

32:36.145 --> 32:38.545
<i>Mike, that's it.
That's all there is.</i>

32:39.515 --> 32:41.115
<i>Mike, you still there?</i>

32:49.555 --> 32:51.660
He had a tie clip.
Looked like a gift.

32:51.785 --> 32:54.179
Didn't want to talk
about his family.

32:54.635 --> 32:56.085
Belle Anna Holding?

32:56.623 --> 32:59.059
- I think I might know what it is.
- You think or you know?

32:59.345 --> 33:00.614
Somewhere in between.

33:00.739 --> 33:02.104
Does Fi have any C-4?

33:02.428 --> 33:03.897
It's Fi, Mike. You got to ask?

33:04.065 --> 33:06.525
Can you walk Barry through
intercepting a call in 10 minutes?

33:07.085 --> 33:09.585
That's gonna be tight,
but, yeah, sure.

33:10.025 --> 33:12.615
Sounds like you've got
something good, Mike.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.760
This is just outside
of my comfort zone, okay?

33:36.885 --> 33:39.183
I'm just saying, I'm not great
with British dialects!

33:39.351 --> 33:41.977
There's no other way, Barry.
Mike's counting on you.

33:43.624 --> 33:45.898
Just breathe, Barry.
It'll all be fine.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.861
How big do we want this?

33:51.345 --> 33:53.238
Well, enough to make a point.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.906
- But not kill the neighbors.
- Really?

33:58.453 --> 34:00.003
Should be good, then.

34:03.835 --> 34:05.485
Tell me this is a joke.

34:05.775 --> 34:08.199
Was I unclear
about the situation here?

34:08.324 --> 34:10.672
No, you were very clear.
I had the box in my hands,

34:10.841 --> 34:11.840
then I decided

34:12.114 --> 34:13.592
you never will. Ever.

34:18.614 --> 34:21.237
Jesus, Fi!
I told you not to kill the neighbors!

34:21.362 --> 34:22.860
You told me to make a point.

34:22.985 --> 34:24.385
Take your picture.

34:26.804 --> 34:27.955
We should go.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.905
Get it now.

34:35.516 --> 34:37.117
Oh, god, please don't.

34:37.835 --> 34:40.034
I'm through playing games, Westen.

34:40.864 --> 34:42.679
I think you got a text message.

34:42.804 --> 34:44.956
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

34:52.534 --> 34:55.134
- What the hell is this?
- It's your house, I believe.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.330
You did this?

34:56.455 --> 34:59.430
You found my place in Miami
and blew it up?

35:01.295 --> 35:04.395
- If that's all you've got...
- Oh, that's not all.

35:04.735 --> 35:08.035
Since we last met,
I became an expert on Tyler Brennen.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.540
I know all about you, where you clean
your teeth, where you do your banking.

35:11.665 --> 35:13.569
Did your banking.
I drained the accounts.

35:15.395 --> 35:17.492
That is a desperate bluff.

35:17.975 --> 35:20.980
- "A" for effort, but...
- I probably wouldn't believe me either.

35:21.105 --> 35:23.420
Hamstead Bank and Trust
has some fine security.

35:23.545 --> 35:26.707
But if you want to make a quick call,
put your mind at ease, I'll wait.

35:37.225 --> 35:39.260
Hamstead.
Are you currently banking with us?

35:39.385 --> 35:41.485
<i>Yes, I need to check my balance.</i>

35:41.665 --> 35:46.311
Account number 06101966.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.062
- Pin 1208.
- <i>1208.</i>

35:49.230 --> 35:50.189
<i>One moment.</i>

35:50.357 --> 35:51.457
Mr. Brennen.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.817
Are you calling about
this morning's transfer?

35:54.165 --> 35:56.737
- Transfer?
- <i>Yes, at 11:00AM local time,</i>

35:57.055 --> 36:00.655
261,000£ was transferred
out of this account.

36:00.780 --> 36:04.365
<i>Your current balance is 4£.
If you like...</i>

36:07.625 --> 36:09.030
You're not this good.

36:09.155 --> 36:10.626
Nobody is this good.

36:10.825 --> 36:11.825
Yes, I am.

36:12.303 --> 36:15.666
I am so good, in fact,
that I can put it all back, right now,

36:15.791 --> 36:16.840
if you let us go.

36:18.815 --> 36:20.715
You know what? I don't care.

36:21.665 --> 36:22.715
Just stuff.

36:22.935 --> 36:24.285
Burn it all down.

36:24.915 --> 36:26.265
I can start over.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.353
But you and your brother
are finished.

36:34.185 --> 36:35.776
What about Belle Anna?

36:38.475 --> 36:40.030
I mean, Annabelle?

36:40.905 --> 36:43.909
- Annabelle?
- Annabelle. Your daughter.

36:44.077 --> 36:46.703
The one who gave you
that nifty tie pin,

36:47.115 --> 36:49.569
the one you're sending
to private school in Switzerland

36:49.694 --> 36:52.417
- for $40,000 a semester.
- You son of a bitch.

36:57.995 --> 37:00.177
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Sweetie, it's daddy.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.490
Are you okay?

37:02.615 --> 37:04.215
<i>Daddy? Yeah.</i>

37:05.155 --> 37:07.933
- <i>Why are you calling so late?</i>
- Honey, I'm sorry.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.844
I forgot...
I forgot what time it was.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.439
You go back to sleep, okay, pumpkin?

37:14.607 --> 37:16.257
I'll call you tomorrow.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.552
This isn't you, Westen.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.489
You're capable of a lot,
but not hurting a child.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.307
But you would, Brennen.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.180
This is your game.
We're playing by your rules.

37:27.305 --> 37:29.162
Why go through all this?
Why not just...

37:29.330 --> 37:32.791
Took some time to get an assassin
into place, halfway around the world.

37:33.095 --> 37:35.878
- You're lying.
- You wanna find out? Shoot me.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.308
If you go near her,

37:40.655 --> 37:42.005
if you touch her,

37:44.035 --> 37:47.135
If she so much as skins her knee
on the playground,

37:48.690 --> 37:50.180
I swear to God, Westen,

37:50.305 --> 37:53.770
I will spend the rest of my life
destroying you...

37:56.483 --> 37:58.333
... and everything you love.

37:58.745 --> 38:00.350
Of course you will, Brennen.

38:00.475 --> 38:01.862
She's your family.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.293
You'll hear from me again.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.046
Yeah, you owe me a Christmas card.

38:39.715 --> 38:40.715
Hey, Nate.

38:41.855 --> 38:43.055
How's the arm?

38:43.945 --> 38:44.945
It's okay.

38:45.085 --> 38:46.735
It's a little bit sore.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.995
- What'd you tell mom?
- I told her I was attacked by a mugger.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.916
I didn't want her to get scared.

38:56.914 --> 38:58.550
You thinking about sticking around?

38:58.675 --> 38:59.825
I don't know.

39:00.268 --> 39:01.931
Feels a little weird being back now.

39:02.056 --> 39:05.056
You know, I thought I was here
to land this big deal, and...

39:05.431 --> 39:08.220
- And instead...
- You were being used by a sociopath?

39:10.955 --> 39:13.555
You know, I really thought
I had something this time.

39:16.065 --> 39:19.115
Nate, I know it's hard sometimes
being my brother.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.608
It's okay, bro.
I'm getting used to it.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.120
Michael. I didn't hear you come in.

39:26.245 --> 39:27.870
Here, honey, drink this.

39:27.995 --> 39:31.895
Hey, mom. I just came by to see
how Nate was feeling, after his mugging.

39:33.455 --> 39:34.855
You know, Michael,

39:35.445 --> 39:36.600
it seems like...

39:36.725 --> 39:39.376
I don't know, such a big coincidence

39:40.925 --> 39:44.725
that Sam, Fi, and Barry
were all mysteriously busy

39:45.095 --> 39:48.995
at the exact same time that Nate
was being beaten up by his mugger.

39:49.465 --> 39:52.465
- Well, maybe it's because...
- Michael, please.

39:53.105 --> 39:55.225
I'd rather you not lie
right to my face.

39:56.165 --> 39:59.619
I'm just glad both of my boys are home.
And that I got to know Barry.

39:59.744 --> 40:02.994
He's coming over later with some new
eucalyptus-infused hair gel.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.052
We're gonna have a product party.

40:12.295 --> 40:14.345
- How's Nate doing?
- Healing.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.405
You know, I'm starting to think...

40:18.835 --> 40:21.168
I screw up his life
better than he does.

40:21.605 --> 40:23.540
Don't be so hard on yourself.

40:23.665 --> 40:25.743
He wouldn't be breathing
if it weren't for you.

40:25.868 --> 40:27.368
I had a little help.

40:28.445 --> 40:29.495
Thanks, Fi.

40:30.625 --> 40:31.725
He's family.

40:35.075 --> 40:36.475
Expecting someone?

40:39.805 --> 40:41.605
Mr. Westen.
May I have a word?

40:42.475 --> 40:44.375
Detective, you look unhappy.

40:44.555 --> 40:45.605
Come on in.

40:45.895 --> 40:48.195
Is your friend coming?

40:49.225 --> 40:51.406
Detective Lopez?
No. He's been suspended.

40:52.405 --> 40:55.570
- Has he been naughty?
- He's been doing his job, actually.

40:55.695 --> 40:57.555
He grilled a mayor's aide
for three hours

40:57.680 --> 41:00.832
about some mysterious bank account
she opened with a Michael Westen.

41:01.265 --> 41:03.264
Turned out to be a bank error,
but not before

41:03.389 --> 41:05.712
the mayor got upset enough
to have his badge yanked.

41:06.095 --> 41:07.130
That's too bad.

41:07.255 --> 41:09.620
I assume you were trying
to get to me.

41:09.745 --> 41:12.427
You'll be glad to know I didn't come by
to ask you questions.

41:13.225 --> 41:14.471
I came by to say this.

41:14.685 --> 41:16.060
You want to play rough,

41:16.185 --> 41:18.244
I can give as good as I get.
