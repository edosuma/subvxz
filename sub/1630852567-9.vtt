how did stig end up outside

into the shelters.

a city directive.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.771

the reason why he's dead

11:12.773 --> 11:16.507
Is because he had nowhere safe

32:19.238 --> 32:20.971

So what was the plan?

34:38.844 --> 34:40.243
You were gonna use the people

To get the city to fund
your housing project

34:42.514 --> 34:45.181

34:48.220 --> 34:50.320
- You picked your poster boy,
but he let you down.

- I'd be very careful about
making accusations

34:52.458 --> 34:55.158
With no evidence, detective.

In front of some
very influential people.

36:02.161 --> 36:05.929

36:08.333 --> 36:10.066
(jug thunks)

36:10.202 --> 36:12.134

from the memorial

36:12.171 --> 36:14.537
And you set his hut on fire.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.139
Of course, no one noticed you

36:16.141 --> 36:19.375
Because you're a regular face
around the encampment.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.079

you used

36:23.148 --> 36:25.949
To confiscate this trash,

36:26.018 --> 36:27.617

36:27.619 --> 36:29.652
