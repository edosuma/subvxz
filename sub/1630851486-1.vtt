[Mr. Tang] The thing you need
to understand

00:38.791 --> 00:40.125
about the old legends
is that the story

00:40.208 --> 00:43.416
is never finished.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.708
There may be
no pages left to turn,

[Mr. Tang]The Monkey King used
his magical Staff

02:54.583 --> 02:56.875
to pick up a nearby mountain.

02:56.958 --> 03:00.333
He trapped the Demon Bull King
underneath it.

03:00.416 --> 03:03.041
The Monkey King sealed
the mountain with The Staff

03:03.125 --> 03:05.291
that no other being could wield,

all the Monkey King stories.

Oh, but I do!

Only those deemed
worthy can wield it.

this is the right mountain?

15:39.083 --> 15:41.916
at least one
complex transformation?

15:43.958 --> 15:45.708
[blasting]

15:48.041 --> 15:49.083
Whoa.

15:53.666 --> 15:57.083
Phew! Huh?
[MK screams]

15:59.250 --> 16:04.541
[screaming continues]

16:11.250 --> 16:13.458
You've gotta be kidding me!

16:19.375 --> 16:21.708
[screaming]

16:21.791 --> 16:23.125
[crashes]

16:24.666 --> 16:25.833
[loud thud]

16:25.916 --> 16:27.750
Noodle boy!

16:27.833 --> 16:31.875
When I find you, I'm gonna
bust you into little bits!

16:43.333 --> 16:44.500
Nailed it!

16:44.583 --> 16:46.375
-Mei!
-[giggles]

16:46.458 --> 16:48.375
That was an intense game of tag.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.041
You guys looked like you
were having so much fun,

16:50.125 --> 16:51.708
I wanted to join in, too!

16:51.791 --> 16:55.000
Actually, I almost died
back there.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.333
But you didn't!

16:56.416 --> 16:58.000
So let's celebrate
with a round of...

16:58.083 --> 17:00.166
Monkey Mech!

17:00.250 --> 17:02.125
You should invite
your new edgy friend, too.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.750
Yeah, he was trying to kill me.

17:04.833 --> 17:08.916
Well, in that case,
where does he live?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.916
MK! Where are you, you punk!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.333
You mind telling me
why some bozo left

17:13.416 --> 17:16.458
a zero star review
on Pigsy's Noodles?

17:16.541 --> 17:18.208
Oh. Uhh, yeah, so, uh...

17:18.291 --> 17:19.500
Here's what
I think happened with that...

17:19.583 --> 17:22.791
Whoa, zero stars! Congrats!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.291
That's better
than nothing, Right?

17:24.375 --> 17:25.958
-That's not how it works, Mei!
-[giggling]

17:26.041 --> 17:27.500
And you, I...

17:28.625 --> 17:30.083
Where'd he go?

17:30.833 --> 17:32.041
[MK] Mr. Tang!

17:32.125 --> 17:33.625
[Pigsy] Hey, hey!

17:33.708 --> 17:35.875
Don't you run away
when I'm trying to scold you!

17:35.958 --> 17:37.291
Get back...

17:38.250 --> 17:40.083
Hmm...

17:40.166 --> 17:42.083
Aww, man! Not again!

17:44.083 --> 17:45.750
[whirring]

17:46.958 --> 17:50.791
[clanking]

17:57.791 --> 18:00.708
[electricity crackling]

18:04.000 --> 18:06.750
And that should about do it.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.500
It's... heavy.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.333
Uh, that's because
it's not powered up. Yet.

18:17.416 --> 18:20.666
The suit absorbs energy
to create energy.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.750
And what better source
than the magic Staff

18:22.833 --> 18:24.666
that kept you underground.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.458
You mean the Staff
that you lost?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.375
Ah, yeah. It was the noodle boy!

18:30.458 --> 18:32.541
-I...
-[Princess Iron Fan laughing]

18:32.625 --> 18:35.791
Oh, don't toy with him, my love.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.041
We will get it back.

18:38.125 --> 18:41.125
I have bull clone
scouring the city.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.500
It's only a matter of time.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.375
And while we wait,
the furnace can convert

18:47.458 --> 18:49.500
other things into energy.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.166
[growling]

18:57.250 --> 18:58.666
The more rare the item,

18:58.750 --> 19:01.458
the more powerful Father
will become.

19:01.541 --> 19:06.250
And once we have that staff,
he will be unstoppable!

19:10.208 --> 19:14.625
Now to find something rare
and expensive.

19:14.708 --> 19:19.041
Something that will give me
the power I deserve.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.083
Mr. Tang!

19:24.166 --> 19:25.916
-Mm?
-Ah!

19:26.000 --> 19:27.541
Remember the story you told me
this morning

19:27.625 --> 19:29.041
about the Demon Bull King?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.000
Ah! Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it??

19:31.083 --> 19:33.500
Ah! There it is!
The Demon Bull King!

19:33.583 --> 19:34.666
See?

19:34.750 --> 19:36.000
Ugh, kid!

19:36.083 --> 19:37.541
What are you doing to me--

19:37.625 --> 19:39.083
Yes?
[slurps]

19:39.166 --> 19:40.500
-What about him?
-Oh, Piggy.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.708
The Demon Bull King is back!

19:42.791 --> 19:44.041
The Legend is real!

19:44.125 --> 19:45.625
The Monkey King's Staff
is removed!

19:45.708 --> 19:46.833
We have to find him.

19:46.916 --> 19:47.833
It's the only way
to save everyone

19:47.916 --> 19:49.125
before the world is destroy.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.708
Ugh. Boy, relax.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.250
You're getting spittle
in my soup.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.416
Besides, you're delusional.
It's just a story.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.000
Delusional, huh?

19:56.083 --> 19:59.041
Would you call THIS delusional!?

20:01.125 --> 20:03.750
Wow, MK, you found a stick.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.333
No! It's Monkey King's Staff!

20:07.166 --> 20:09.291
[all laugh]

20:09.375 --> 20:11.375
You aren't listening!
Demon Bull King is out there!

20:11.458 --> 20:13.458
We have to get this Staff back
to the Monkey King!

20:13.541 --> 20:16.125
It's the real deal!
I'll prove it!

20:16.208 --> 20:18.041
Oh, yeah? How?

20:19.083 --> 20:20.250
Uhh...

20:26.083 --> 20:28.541
Ooh, Monkey King's Staff!

20:28.625 --> 20:29.875
I knew it all along!

20:29.958 --> 20:31.208
The legendary weapon
that only he could wield

20:31.291 --> 20:32.625
to seal away evil!

20:33.916 --> 20:35.375
Wait a minute,
why do you have it?

20:35.458 --> 20:37.041
All right, I'll bite.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.666
If the staff is here,

20:38.750 --> 20:40.916
then where is
the demon punk now?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.125
He's at a shoe store.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.416
What?

20:43.500 --> 20:44.875
This had better not be
another one

20:44.958 --> 20:47.583
-of your puppy videos, Mei.
-[chuckles]

20:47.666 --> 20:50.500
There's always time
for a puppy video.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.000
But, no.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.500
Look what just started trending.
#DemonBullKing.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.333
[Red Son clears throat]

21:11.416 --> 21:13.708
We're here for
the new Yeelzabub shoes.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.791
Yeah. You and everyone else.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.125
Head to the back of the line.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.208
Yeah, yes!

21:23.291 --> 21:26.000
Do you know who he is?

21:26.083 --> 21:30.166
That's the DBK
you're talking to!

21:30.250 --> 21:32.291
Oh, yeah. That's cool.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.083
Why don't you tell the people
at the back of the line?

21:37.125 --> 21:40.708
I am Demon Bull King,

21:40.791 --> 21:43.000
scourge of the netherworld,

21:43.083 --> 21:47.500
and I will be taking
those shoes.

21:47.583 --> 21:51.333
Uh! You still have
to wait in line.

21:51.416 --> 21:52.500
I'm sorry?

21:52.583 --> 21:54.416
You will be!

21:56.416 --> 21:57.833
[gasps]

22:02.750 --> 22:06.250
[growling]

22:16.791 --> 22:18.583
[tinkling]

22:20.083 --> 22:23.291
Do you know what's better
than limited edition?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.166
One of a kind!

22:26.250 --> 22:30.458
[evil laughter]

22:36.708 --> 22:40.708
[crashing]

22:40.791 --> 22:44.625
[growling]

22:52.375 --> 22:54.291
[growling continues]

22:54.375 --> 22:56.416
[laughing]

22:56.500 --> 23:01.541
Yes! With every item absorbed,
my family comes one step closer

23:01.625 --> 23:03.833
to total domination!

23:03.916 --> 23:06.000
Once we get
the Monkey King's Staff,

23:06.083 --> 23:08.291
we will be unstoppable!

23:08.375 --> 23:10.750
Eh, Very tight!

23:13.833 --> 23:15.541
Pigsy! Watch where you're going!

23:15.625 --> 23:17.083
You're going to kill us!

23:17.166 --> 23:18.500
Yeah! We've got to get
to Flower Fruit Mountain

23:18.583 --> 23:20.750
without getting smooshed
in a car crash.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.791
All we need to do is drive
through an entire ocean.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.208
-Simple!
-[Mei] Guys!

23:25.291 --> 23:26.708
Demon Bull King's
moved on to downtown!

23:26.791 --> 23:28.916
He's destroying
the cheese tea stalls!

23:29.000 --> 23:31.083
[MK] All the more reason to get
this Staff to Monkey King.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.916
Flower Fruit Mountain.
It's the only place he could be.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.041
Right, Mr. Tang?

23:35.125 --> 23:36.833
Hmm. Indeed.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.083
However, Flower Fruit mountain
is hidden away,

23:40.166 --> 23:43.291
deep in dangerous
and unknown territory.

23:43.375 --> 23:45.291
So, I guess we better turn back!

23:45.375 --> 23:46.375
-[nervous laugh]
-[both] What?

23:46.458 --> 23:48.291
Ah, shut it, ya big baby!

23:48.375 --> 23:50.375
I know a guy
that can take us there.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.958
The most dangerous. Deadly.

23:53.041 --> 23:56.333
Rage-filled warrior
I've ever known.

23:56.416 --> 23:58.125
[brake screeching]

24:00.500 --> 24:02.791
[Pigsy] Sandy.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.375
[door creaks]

24:04.458 --> 24:05.666
[both quivering]

24:08.500 --> 24:10.458
That's a lot to take in.

24:10.541 --> 24:14.125
You know what I do to people
who disrupt the peace?

24:14.208 --> 24:16.625
Serve 'em tea!
You guys want some?

24:16.708 --> 24:18.750
You? How about
that guy over there? Eh? Eh?

24:18.833 --> 24:20.458
[Mr. Tang] Oh, yes!
[Mr. Tang giggles]

24:20.541 --> 24:21.958
Don't mind if I do!

24:22.041 --> 24:24.083
Certain noodle shop owners
could learn a lot

24:24.166 --> 24:26.500
from your hospitality, Sandy.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.750
Oh, you're right, Piggy,
this guy is dangerous!

24:29.833 --> 24:31.750
He'll kill us with cuteness!

24:31.833 --> 24:34.541
It's my own blend
of anti-stress fruits.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.250
[Sandy] It really brings
the heart rate down.

24:36.333 --> 24:41.166
Ugh! Sandy?
What happened to you?

24:41.250 --> 24:42.916
Where's the angry,
glass-chewing,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.291
fist-throwing buddy
I used to know!?

24:45.375 --> 24:48.791
Oh, well, my therapist said
I really needed to calm down.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.125
That's why I started
drinking tea, doing yoga.

24:52.208 --> 24:55.458
Investing in therapy cats.
Really helps.

24:55.541 --> 24:57.625
Aw, don't you, Mo?
[chuckles]

24:57.708 --> 25:01.666
Oh, Mister Sandy, sir?
We could really use your help.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.416
We've gotta get
to Flower Fruit Mountain.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.750
Please? The fate of the world
is at stake.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.708
-Okay.
-Really?

25:11.791 --> 25:13.333
Anything for Pigsy.

25:13.416 --> 25:15.916
I can get you there,
but it ain't a pleasant trip.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.958
-Yes, yes, yes!
-[Mei snickering]

25:18.041 --> 25:20.000
-All right! Let's get moving.
-Whoo!

25:20.083 --> 25:23.250
But I'm telling you now,
old friend, if things get hairy,

25:23.333 --> 25:24.583
I've changed,

25:24.666 --> 25:27.000
I don't go round
picking fights no more.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.375
-[grunts]
-Mo!

25:29.458 --> 25:31.416
Initiate the launch sequence!

25:31.500 --> 25:32.541
[meows]

25:32.625 --> 25:34.041
Launch sequence?

25:35.375 --> 25:37.291
[meowing]

25:38.833 --> 25:40.541
[alarm blaring]

25:40.625 --> 25:42.041
-[rumbles]
-[whimpers]

25:48.333 --> 25:51.375
Onwards,
to Flower Fruit Mountain!

25:56.208 --> 25:58.833
[MK] Oh, yeah!

26:00.833 --> 26:02.250
Hmm...

26:07.875 --> 26:10.041
[clears throat]

26:10.125 --> 26:11.416
[grunts]

26:15.625 --> 26:19.041
What? You let them get away?

26:19.125 --> 26:23.583
Oh, so your plan didn't go
"according to plan," hmm?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.500
Oh, don't worry,
my sweet, useless boy.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.791
Mother will get the Staff.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.583
I'm not about
to let anyone stop us.

26:35.666 --> 26:36.875
Not this time.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.333
[calm music]

26:48.750 --> 26:51.750
Halt, evil monster,
I must thwart thee!

26:51.833 --> 26:56.041
For I am...
the Monkey King... Ugh!

26:57.916 --> 26:59.000
[thuds]

26:59.083 --> 27:00.541
Whoo! That was awesome!

27:00.625 --> 27:02.041
Ahh! Sorry, Mei!

27:02.583 --> 27:03.958
[grunting]

27:06.166 --> 27:08.333
[groans]
Oh...

27:09.000 --> 27:10.083
Huh?

27:12.916 --> 27:15.666
We're here!
Flower Fruit Mountain!

27:15.750 --> 27:16.791
[yells]

27:17.666 --> 27:19.583
[both screaming]

27:20.208 --> 27:21.791
[splashes]

27:23.500 --> 27:24.541
Huh?

27:26.416 --> 27:28.708
[MK] Whoa!

27:28.791 --> 27:31.041
Welcome to the
flaming mountains, gang!

27:31.125 --> 27:32.750
A volcanic ring surrounds
the mountain

27:32.833 --> 27:35.416
making it virtually impassable.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.166
[Sandy] This path is the only
safe way through.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.750
That's as close
as the boat can get.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.208
Just... be careful.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.916
Stupid Sandy, stupid Tang,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.416
staying cozy
in their stupid boat.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.375
What did I do to deserve this,
noodle gods?

27:51.458 --> 27:52.625
[shouts]

27:53.541 --> 27:55.541
Careful, Piggy. Yhee!

27:55.625 --> 27:57.041
You gotta wonder
why Monkey King decided

27:57.125 --> 27:58.583
to live here of all places.

27:58.666 --> 28:00.000
-[gasps]
-You know, when Monkey King

28:00.083 --> 28:01.583
had to get through
the flaming mountains,

28:01.666 --> 28:04.291
he actually used

28:27.250 --> 28:30.166
I'll be taking that Staff now.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.333
This belongs to the monkey king.

28:32.416 --> 28:34.416
There's no way
I'm letting you take it!

28:34.500 --> 28:36.291
[Princess Iron Fan] Oh,
you're just a little noodle boy

28:36.375 --> 28:38.708

28:38.791 --> 28:40.458
Sorry to disappoint.

[thunder rumbling]

29:31.625 --> 29:34.625
[Pigsy] He can't be gone.
He can't.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.875
[Sandy] I'm sorry, Pigsy.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.041
[Mr. Tang] There was nothing
we could do.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.708
"Nothing"? "Nothing!"

29:42.791 --> 29:45.375
I could'a done something!
I could'a...

29:45.458 --> 29:48.416
I should've protected MK.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.541
[sighs]
[Pigsy] It's over.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.833
[Mr. Tang] It's not over.

29:53.916 --> 29:55.666
We can't help MK.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.375
But we can make sure
no more lives are lost,

29:58.458 --> 30:01.458
make sure his sacrifice
wasn't in vain.

30:04.166 --> 30:06.375

32:59.833 --> 33:02.000
That's Monkey King being born
from a stone!

33:02.083 --> 33:04.291
And when he got his Staff
from the Dragon of the East!

33:08.166 --> 33:09.583

33:46.500 --> 33:49.166
Ugh. What was I thinking?

33:49.250 --> 33:51.458
For a moment there, I thought...

33:51.541 --> 33:54.250
[sighs]
Mr. Tang was right,

33:54.333 --> 33:56.041
I really am delusional.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.916
-Sup?

Is it dead?

34:19.041 --> 34:20.958
Mo... Monkey King?

34:21.041 --> 34:23.208
Yeah. The one and only.

34:23.291 --> 34:25.375
So, where's my Staff?

34:27.500 --> 34:29.708
I'm so sorry!
I tried to bring it to you,

34:29.791 --> 34:31.416
but Princess Iron Fan came
and took it!

34:31.500 --> 34:32.916
She's got this glove and--

34:33.000 --> 34:35.958
I know, I know.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.458
Um, I've been
kinda watching you.

[squawks]

34:42.416 --> 34:44.666
Wait, what? That was you!?

34:44.750 --> 34:50.166
Ha! The look on your face!
You're perfect!

34:50.250 --> 34:51.583
Perfect for what?

34:52.666 --> 34:56.625
To be... my successor.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.291
Uhh, are you sure
you're the Monkey King?

34:59.375 --> 35:01.208
You been cooped up
in here way too long!

35:01.291 --> 35:04.083
I think you're brain
went mushed up.

35:04.166 --> 35:07.791
Listen, kid. You fought demons.
And you didn't die.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.375
And you made it here.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.666
Not just anyone
can lift my Staff.

35:11.750 --> 35:12.958
But you did.

35:13.958 --> 35:15.375
But what about DBK?

35:15.458 --> 35:18.958
Pfft, ha! What about DBK?
You can handle it.

35:19.041 --> 35:21.458
[munching]
Consider it a trial.

But I...

you can use it.

Just believe in yourself.

35:32.166 --> 35:34.958
Even a smidge makes
all the difference.

35:36.875 --> 35:41.125
The Staff was taken from you.
Take it back.

I... I thought you were all,
like, pew! Ah!

38:04.333 --> 38:05.708
But... But you're not!

38:05.791 --> 38:08.166
Where'd you get a jet?
Way to trash it already.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.666
Wait, Monkey King,
did you find him?

38:10.750 --> 38:13.000
Yeah. I did!

38:13.083 --> 38:15.416
So, where is he?

38:15.500 --> 38:19.125
He said it's up to me. To us.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.083
Well, that's anti-climactic.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.791

And how are we meant
to fight that?

You clean the streets.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.541
[Demon Bull King] You might have
that old fool's Staff,

41:44.625 --> 41:48.875

Why don't you get out
of that dorky mech

43:04.875 --> 43:07.208
and fight me, you coward?

Yeah.

-[gasps]
-You did it, little man.

Isn't it obvious?

Yeah.

Bust up more bad guys!
