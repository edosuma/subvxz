WEBVTT

00:07.926 --> 00:10.666
A little known sporting
contest, the Olympics,

00:10.667 --> 00:12.732
is coming to America for the first time.

00:12.802 --> 00:16.136
As a Bavarian, I am most excited
for the archery competition.

00:16.204 --> 00:17.837
<i>In fact, my nephew Adolf</i>

00:17.907 --> 00:19.906
<i>is coming from Austria to observe.</i>

00:20.367 --> 00:22.046
Bull's-eye!

00:22.246 --> 00:23.654
Adolf, did you see that?

00:24.341 --> 00:25.216
Uncle Victor,

00:26.259 --> 00:28.526
do you ever feel like
the beauty of the world

00:28.528 --> 00:30.802
is so intense that your heart may just

00:30.803 --> 00:32.366
explode in your chest?

00:33.641 --> 00:34.875
Oh, my God.

00:34.876 --> 00:37.418
<i>I know he's my nephew, but I must admit,</i>

00:37.745 --> 00:39.879
I do not care for Adolf Hitler.

00:40.722 --> 00:43.530
And that concludes
men's archery for today!

00:43.812 --> 00:45.350
Huh. That's queer.

00:45.351 --> 00:47.460
The way he said "men's archery,"

00:47.461 --> 00:49.144
as though there could be any other kind.

00:49.146 --> 00:51.239
And now may I present the competitors

00:51.240 --> 00:54.453
for the first-ever
Olympic women's archery team.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.541
What... did he say "women's"?

01:00.181 --> 01:02.574
Women? In Archery?

01:02.644 --> 01:03.953
Women in archery!

01:08.852 --> 01:11.752
No!

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:29.617 --> 01:30.949
Absolutely disgusting!

01:31.026 --> 01:32.801
God hates you! You!

01:33.066 --> 01:35.170
And since all women are disabled
when it comes to sport,

01:35.171 --> 01:36.958
here to usher in this
momentous new occasion,

01:36.959 --> 01:39.980
my good friend, the one
and only, Helen Keller.

01:41.150 --> 01:42.687
Save your cheers and taunts.

01:42.688 --> 01:44.580
She doesn't know where she is.

01:44.603 --> 01:47.683
Of course they choose Helen Keller
to be the ladies' sports ambassador.

01:47.684 --> 01:49.096
She can't even compete!

01:49.097 --> 01:51.539
I never let my circumstance

01:51.540 --> 01:52.950
determine my destiny.

01:52.966 --> 01:55.353
And neither do the inspiring women here.

01:56.509 --> 01:58.639
By the tits of Medusa, don't clap.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.766
She doesn't know
you're clapping for her!

02:00.767 --> 02:03.232
Keller or not,
I'm joining this archery team.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.703
Prep the sports corset.

02:04.704 --> 02:06.304
Make ready my field gown.

02:06.590 --> 02:09.586
If anyone's going to be famous
for sports, it's going to be me.

02:10.157 --> 02:11.179
Help me down.

02:18.753 --> 02:22.220
Freddy, that is not how
an adult unpacks.

02:22.290 --> 02:24.874
What are you doing
with the Constitution?

02:24.875 --> 02:27.126
- Oh, I signed that.
- You should not have done that.

02:27.195 --> 02:28.594
Yeah, there's some tricky stuff

02:28.662 --> 02:30.295
about black people in there.

02:30.364 --> 02:32.798
Just find somewhere safe to keep it.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.201
Freddy.

02:36.202 --> 02:38.003
This is your birth certificate.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.219
Says that you're adopted.

02:42.844 --> 02:43.809
What?

02:44.657 --> 02:48.097
That means your mother and father
aren't your mother and father.

02:49.562 --> 02:51.053
Mumu and Pupu?

02:51.518 --> 02:55.189
That means that Lillian and
Hortense aren't your sisters.

02:55.256 --> 02:57.122
Oh, no.

02:57.191 --> 02:58.624
Oh, no.

02:58.694 --> 03:00.827
Wait, who's Hortense?

03:00.895 --> 03:03.362
Neither is Beatrice.

03:04.700 --> 03:08.034
I've been... having sex with
a stranger my whole life?

03:08.102 --> 03:10.034
No, if Beatrice isn't your sister,

03:10.106 --> 03:12.204
that means you didn't commit incest.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.739
Yes, I understand what it means!

03:13.809 --> 03:14.946
You don't have to rub it in.

03:14.947 --> 03:16.275
No, it's a good thing.

03:16.345 --> 03:18.178
There is no scandal.

03:18.244 --> 03:20.545
You're just... a regular adulterer.

03:20.613 --> 03:21.813
It's a good thing?

03:21.882 --> 03:23.381
Yes, everyone in Washington

03:23.451 --> 03:25.284
cheats on their wives and vice versa.

03:25.353 --> 03:26.265
What?

03:26.266 --> 03:29.330
We'll announce the good news
right after the Olympics.

03:31.827 --> 03:34.159
I cannot believe they're
allowing female archers

03:34.228 --> 03:35.896
into the Olympics!

03:35.963 --> 03:38.664
I mean, archery was our final refuge.

03:38.732 --> 03:41.099
Yes, we have our clubs
and our corporations,

03:41.168 --> 03:42.567
and the entire Congress, but

03:42.636 --> 03:45.203
what does any of it
mean without archery?

03:45.273 --> 03:48.526
Why can't women be happy
with traditional ladies' sports,

03:48.527 --> 03:50.909
like giving me a backrub or...

03:50.980 --> 03:52.779
no sports at all?

03:52.846 --> 03:55.079
It's not even the fact
that they're women.

03:55.149 --> 03:58.985
It's just that archery
was good as it was.

03:59.603 --> 04:02.093
And do you know what burns me?

04:02.224 --> 04:04.670
When you're courting a woman
and you think you have a...

04:04.671 --> 04:06.359
a very good conversation

04:06.427 --> 04:08.726
about the value of her father's horses,

04:08.797 --> 04:11.196
and so you give your
calling card to her butler.

04:11.266 --> 04:13.731
And then she takes two weeks

04:13.802 --> 04:17.803
to have her servant deliver
her calling card to your butler.

04:17.872 --> 04:20.939
- I mean, what are we even doing?
- What are we doing?

04:21.009 --> 04:23.610
Honestly, women's archery
is but the first step

04:23.679 --> 04:25.611
towards a world none
of us would recognize.

04:25.679 --> 04:28.306
Gentlemen, it is time to take action.

04:28.307 --> 04:29.757
Excuse me, Uncle Victor,

04:30.328 --> 04:33.326
but this conversation's
a bit too barbaric for my taste.

04:34.122 --> 04:36.220
Could I please go to
the garden and draw?

04:36.290 --> 04:38.123
Yes, go.

04:40.696 --> 04:42.328
What was that?

04:43.864 --> 04:46.176
Timothy, I have great news.

04:46.177 --> 04:48.008
You're a princess.

04:48.847 --> 04:51.110
Beatrice, I have great news.

04:51.172 --> 04:51.990
What is it?

04:51.991 --> 04:54.807
You and I are not brother and sister.

04:54.882 --> 04:57.153
But... we have all the same servants.

04:57.154 --> 05:00.412
I know, but Celery found my gift
certificate, and I'm adopted.

05:00.482 --> 05:01.814
Do you know what this means?

05:01.884 --> 05:02.851
No.

05:02.852 --> 05:05.251
It means that we can
finally be together.

05:05.319 --> 05:08.153
- Oh, Frederick.
- Oh.

05:14.595 --> 05:16.761
What? Is it my breath?

05:16.831 --> 05:18.061
Because I've been playing this game

05:18.131 --> 05:19.752
where I brush my teeth never.

05:19.912 --> 05:21.846
No, that's not it.

05:22.271 --> 05:24.588
It feels like something's missing.

05:25.273 --> 05:26.430
With us.

05:27.454 --> 05:29.172
Well, then, we have to go find it.

05:40.155 --> 05:42.355
All wealthy women learn
archery when they're young.

05:42.424 --> 05:43.890
It's the only sport that teaches

05:43.960 --> 05:45.759
the three basic tenets of womanhood:

05:45.826 --> 05:48.559
silence, standing still,
and crushing boredom.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.700
Hear ye! Hear ye!

05:51.781 --> 05:54.557
We are the WNBA!

05:55.471 --> 05:58.608
The Worried Nationalists
on Behalf of Archery.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.807
And we are here to claim

06:00.876 --> 06:04.143
archery as a sport for gentlemen!

06:05.413 --> 06:08.646
So get your fat, bloated pig face

06:08.715 --> 06:10.482
off of my archery range!

06:11.070 --> 06:12.258
I'll tell you what, Victor.

06:12.259 --> 06:14.762
We'll leave if
you can hit the bull's-eye.

06:15.349 --> 06:17.332
Hell, we'll leave if you
can even hit the target.

06:18.947 --> 06:20.676
Please.

06:20.745 --> 06:23.212
This is so easy.

06:35.110 --> 06:35.664
Ow.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.926
No, no, no, this is...

06:37.997 --> 06:39.329
this is a bow for women.

06:39.397 --> 06:40.897
It's not regulation.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.432
- Yeah.
- Stop laughing.

06:42.516 --> 06:45.227
No, no, actually... keep laughing.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.903
As a man, I command
you to keep laughing.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.906
- That's it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

06:51.139 --> 06:52.236
<i>This isn't over.</i>

06:52.267 --> 06:54.784
I've got quite a few
more arrows in my...

06:56.505 --> 06:58.947
uh, what's the thing
they keep the arrows in?

06:59.988 --> 07:02.604
My arrow... holder.

07:04.253 --> 07:06.552
Beatrice and I lost our love somewhere,

07:06.771 --> 07:09.000
so we decided to retrace our steps

07:09.032 --> 07:10.399
and see where we left it.

07:10.832 --> 07:12.098
And hopefully it's in the house,

07:12.099 --> 07:14.078
because I once lost a
teddy bear in the woods

07:14.079 --> 07:15.505
and I never...

07:19.839 --> 07:20.927
I never...

07:24.357 --> 07:25.992
still out there.

07:26.824 --> 07:28.638
Remember when we were babies,

07:28.724 --> 07:31.136
and also last year when
we used to take baths together?

07:31.137 --> 07:32.147
Mm-hmm.

07:32.148 --> 07:34.202
Maybe this is where we lost our love.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.214
Oh, Frederick.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.812
I don't think we left
our love in the tub.

07:43.382 --> 07:44.857
Remember this place,

07:45.161 --> 07:47.396
where I lost my virginity to you...

07:47.801 --> 07:50.040
and you're pretty sure
you lost it to me?

07:50.041 --> 07:52.057
Maybe this is where we lost our love.

07:52.434 --> 07:53.898
Oh, Frederick.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.411
I'm sorry.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.218
I don't think we left it here either.

08:00.238 --> 08:01.614
Remember this place?

08:03.289 --> 08:04.335
No.

08:04.723 --> 08:05.598
Not at all.

08:06.322 --> 08:09.318
Me neither. I don't think I've even
ever been in this room before.

08:09.319 --> 08:10.740
Why did I bring you here?

08:12.071 --> 08:14.156
Frederick. Did you ever think...

08:14.157 --> 08:16.669
Don't say it.
Don't say that I would have lost

08:16.671 --> 08:18.255
that foot race to
Chucky Addleston if I hadn't

08:18.256 --> 08:20.798
told him his mother died
of an exploding brain.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.653
I wasn't.

08:21.952 --> 08:22.550
Oh.

08:23.338 --> 08:24.557
I was going to say,

08:24.995 --> 08:26.775
do you think maybe
our love is gone because

08:26.776 --> 08:28.657
we're no longer brother and sister?

08:29.220 --> 08:31.046
Well, maybe we can just pretend.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.309
You mean, like role play?

08:32.379 --> 08:34.013
Ooh! I call Beatrice.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.265
You always get to be Beatrice.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.770
Well, maybe because
I'm better at it than you.

08:39.469 --> 08:42.436
"Grr. I'm Beatrice. And I'm your sister.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.724
And I'll poison the nanny if she
tries to teach us the alphabet."

08:45.792 --> 08:49.493
"Ooh, I'm Frederick.
And I'm your brother.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.162
We share the same toilet."

08:51.233 --> 08:51.918
Oh.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.109
And we share the same...

08:55.802 --> 08:57.047
Parents.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.701
- Oh, Beatrice.
- Oh, Frederick.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.576
Oh, oh, oh, be gentle.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.710
Ah!

09:08.215 --> 09:10.049
Wait, wait.

09:14.654 --> 09:15.535
It's no use.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.705
I think, maybe,

09:18.323 --> 09:21.358
being twins was the only thing
keeping us together.

09:21.529 --> 09:24.463
Guess I'll just have to
go find my real parents.

09:24.532 --> 09:27.314
Maybe I have a real sister
who I can have sex with.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.344
She's a lucky girl.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.744
I know.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.333
Words didn't seem to deter them,

09:44.334 --> 09:47.367
so the WNBA is taking things up a notch.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.250
Why, Judith,

09:50.251 --> 09:52.405
these are your private boudoir drawings.

09:55.946 --> 09:57.845
Ah!

09:57.913 --> 09:59.579
Smile less!

09:59.649 --> 10:01.381
What do you have to be so happy about?

10:01.448 --> 10:03.248
I'm going back to Iowa.

10:06.922 --> 10:07.648
Telegram.

10:08.558 --> 10:10.957
"I'm going to [bleep]... stop...
your face... stop."

10:11.026 --> 10:11.803
I quit!

10:15.947 --> 10:17.962
Oh, my God.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.568
"Next time, this goes into your uterus."

10:26.308 --> 10:27.675
Well done, gentlemen.

10:27.744 --> 10:29.077
Well done.

10:29.810 --> 10:32.010
This one?

10:32.079 --> 10:33.613
I'll take care of her.

10:43.891 --> 10:45.834
What is that wonderful aroma?

11:09.385 --> 11:11.450
Good Shabbos, Hamish.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.552
Good Shabbos, Doctor.

11:13.622 --> 11:14.540
Oh.

11:15.790 --> 11:16.821
Hello.

11:17.294 --> 11:18.491
Can we help you?

11:18.560 --> 11:20.293
Yeah. What is this table of delights?

11:20.361 --> 11:22.062
Why, this is Shabbat.

11:22.130 --> 11:24.663
It's the centerpiece
of the entire Jewish faith.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.932
Oh. Where are our manners?

11:27.001 --> 11:29.068
Take a seat. Huh? Join us.

11:29.139 --> 11:30.904
All are welcome here.

11:32.006 --> 11:34.741
Are you not going
to the women's archery event?

11:34.809 --> 11:36.342
The women's archery event?

11:38.447 --> 11:39.827
What will they think of next?

11:39.828 --> 11:41.549
Women's shoes?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.749
Medicine, but for women?

11:46.656 --> 11:50.156
Ah, smells like the hallah's ready.

11:52.621 --> 11:54.595
Damn it, Lillian. Listen to reason.

11:54.663 --> 11:56.996
A woman has no place
in an archery competition.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.299
Listen to me, you festering boil,

11:59.369 --> 12:00.567
women aren't good at anything.

12:00.635 --> 12:02.102
We're not smart enough to vote.

12:02.172 --> 12:03.838
We're not stable enough to own property.

12:03.905 --> 12:05.539
We can't be trusted with a bank account.

12:05.608 --> 12:07.174
And on top of that, we're not funny.

12:07.242 --> 12:08.236
That's true.

12:08.237 --> 12:09.909
But we can shoot a [bleep] arrow

12:09.977 --> 12:11.201
into a goddamn target,

12:11.202 --> 12:12.777
so just give me that one little thing.

12:12.847 --> 12:14.112
God, why won't you drop out

12:14.183 --> 12:15.313
like your pathetic little friends?

12:15.384 --> 12:16.435
I don't know if you've heard,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.853
but your little archery whores
are proving to be cowards

12:18.920 --> 12:20.786
in the face of very real
threats of violence

12:20.856 --> 12:21.922
from me.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.075
Yes, well, now that you've
eliminated my competition,

12:24.076 --> 12:25.661
the gold will be all mine.

12:25.727 --> 12:26.991
I wanted to thank you for that.

12:27.062 --> 12:29.294
You're so thoughtful.

12:30.265 --> 12:31.899
So then the farmer goes to Heaven,

12:31.967 --> 12:32.766
and he says to God...

12:34.737 --> 12:36.002
And then God says to the farmer...

12:43.779 --> 12:46.045
We are having so much fun
with you, little boy.

12:46.115 --> 12:47.714
- You know, I've got an idea.
- Yes?

12:47.784 --> 12:49.384
Why don't we go round the table

12:49.451 --> 12:52.685
and engage in that
ancient Jewish ritual,

12:52.755 --> 12:55.956
where we say whom,
if we could travel back in time,

12:56.024 --> 12:57.557
each of us would kill.

12:57.626 --> 12:59.626
Oh, good, good. I love this game.

12:59.693 --> 13:01.294
- Go, go, go, go.
- Okay.

13:01.362 --> 13:02.714
I would choose Marco Polo

13:02.715 --> 13:04.964
for stealing pasta from the Chinese.

13:05.033 --> 13:06.767
Let's see. Who would I choose?

13:06.837 --> 13:08.501
I think that I would choose

13:08.569 --> 13:10.369
my ex-lover, Louise.

13:10.439 --> 13:12.433
Oh, wait! No, she's still alive.

13:12.434 --> 13:14.373
So, technically, I could kill her now.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.443
So, um, uh, Marco Polo as well.

13:16.510 --> 13:19.060
- Marco Polo.
- What about you, little Adolf?

13:19.061 --> 13:21.179
Yes, Hitler, who would you kill

13:21.250 --> 13:22.983
if you could go back in time?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.642
Oh, I...

13:27.643 --> 13:29.303
I don't like to think about violence.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.491
It makes my tummy queasy.

13:31.559 --> 13:33.791
- Ah.
- Oh, well.

13:33.862 --> 13:36.295
You're a better man than I.

13:36.366 --> 13:37.731
To Adolf Hitler!

13:37.799 --> 13:39.799
To Adolf "Peaceful" Hitler!

13:39.870 --> 13:41.602
Shabbat shalom, young man.

13:41.669 --> 13:43.469
- Yes.
- Sha... bbat shalom.

13:43.539 --> 13:44.605
Mm.

13:47.108 --> 13:48.305
And... bite

13:48.376 --> 13:50.924
and chew and chew and bite

13:50.925 --> 13:53.246
and chew and chew and chew

13:53.314 --> 13:54.712
and bite.

13:54.779 --> 13:57.844
And chew and chew and chew and chew...

13:58.086 --> 13:59.720
I saw my birth certificate.

13:59.788 --> 14:01.154
I know that I am adopted,

14:01.222 --> 14:03.154
and that Beatrice is not my sister.

14:03.223 --> 14:05.123
So you don't have to
lie to me anymore, Mother.

14:05.193 --> 14:06.445
If that is your real name.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.694
Don't be ridiculous, Frederick.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.297
Keep chewing, Garfield.

14:10.366 --> 14:13.133
You and Beatrice are both my children.

14:13.202 --> 14:15.711
I gave birth to you, remember?

14:18.169 --> 14:19.740
I don't remember.

14:19.808 --> 14:22.174
Frederick, you're not adopted.

14:22.245 --> 14:23.498
Now, please leave.

14:23.499 --> 14:25.845
I've just started a new health regimen.

14:27.939 --> 14:29.437
And... bite

14:29.637 --> 14:32.170
and chew and chew and chew

14:32.288 --> 14:34.621
and bite and chew and chew.

14:34.691 --> 14:35.734
New apple.

14:36.953 --> 14:37.977
Goddamn Dodo.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.026
Of course I forged that
birth certificate.

14:40.095 --> 14:41.109
But don't worry,

14:41.522 --> 14:44.352
I'll find a way to get Frederick
into the White House.

14:44.919 --> 14:45.597
And now,

14:46.339 --> 14:48.317
the moment you have all
been waiting for:

14:48.450 --> 14:51.950
the Women's Lady-Archery Finals.

14:52.073 --> 14:53.573
Get off the field!

14:55.510 --> 14:57.876
Unfortunately, all of
the other competitors

14:57.946 --> 15:00.366
have dropped out, other
than Lillian Bellacourt.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.115
- Which means...
- I win.

15:02.183 --> 15:03.749
I win the gold!

15:03.818 --> 15:05.452
The event is cancelled.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.175
Of course, you can't have a
competition without competitors, so.

15:08.176 --> 15:10.356
Well, that's not fair.
I've already had my neck girded

15:10.425 --> 15:12.258
to support the weight
of the heavy gold medal.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.860
If life were fair, Lillian,
then lemons would be sweet

15:14.861 --> 15:17.194
and my wife would be her brother, Gary.

15:17.265 --> 15:20.033
You shall not play archery today.

15:22.469 --> 15:26.281
Ladies, are you going to let
these sniveling half-men

15:26.282 --> 15:28.606
intimidate you into giving up the chance

15:28.677 --> 15:30.795
to lose a competition to me?

15:31.503 --> 15:32.524
Who's with me?

15:33.201 --> 15:33.880
Wait!

15:34.221 --> 15:35.816
I will compete.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.151
May the woman with
the most functioning senses win.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.958
Beatrice, there are you.

15:45.025 --> 15:46.693
I have wonderful news.

15:46.761 --> 15:49.160
I spoke with Mother, and she is positive

15:49.231 --> 15:50.361
that we both came out of her.

15:50.432 --> 15:52.298
We are brother and sister.

15:52.367 --> 15:53.834
Oh, Frederick!

15:53.901 --> 15:54.967
Mmm.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.856
- Wait.
- Mm?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.058
- Wait.
- What?

16:02.478 --> 16:04.417
I just remembered
where we lost our love.

16:04.418 --> 16:07.234
- It was here, in this room.
- Ah.

16:07.235 --> 16:08.948
When you blamed me for our relationship

16:09.018 --> 16:10.804
and sent me to live in a nunnery.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.681
How does that have
anything to do with this?

16:14.057 --> 16:15.589
Well, you were mean to me.

16:15.656 --> 16:18.139
And for reasons I don't understand,

16:18.459 --> 16:21.383
that makes me not want to
have sex with you anymore.

16:21.996 --> 16:24.395
I just don't understand how my behavior

16:24.466 --> 16:27.166
and your desire to have sex
with me are at all related.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.428
I don't know either.

16:29.038 --> 16:30.538
But it's over, Frederick.

16:30.606 --> 16:32.472
No. It can't be over.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.972
No, Beatrice, wait... don't leave me.

16:35.043 --> 16:36.409
Where are you going?

16:36.477 --> 16:38.145
I'm going to watch women's archery.

16:39.747 --> 16:41.313
Women's archery?

16:41.381 --> 16:42.982
Don't laugh. It's not funny!

16:43.052 --> 16:44.452
It's pretty funny.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.986
No, no! Beatrice, please don't leave me.

16:47.648 --> 16:48.951
Adolf, I just gotta say,

16:48.952 --> 16:50.369
I can't get it out of my mind.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.114
Why wouldn't you kill somebody

16:53.115 --> 16:54.945
if you knew that you
could get away with it hum?

16:54.946 --> 16:58.262
Yes, even I, who have taken
an oath to preserve life,

16:58.263 --> 16:59.833
other than those lives that I've taken

16:59.835 --> 17:01.702
through medical malpractice, would

17:01.796 --> 17:04.353
love to kill a man from time to time.

17:04.354 --> 17:06.292
Destroying life is destroying art.

17:07.021 --> 17:08.567
Und I am an artist.

17:09.255 --> 17:10.720
You're an artist?

17:10.753 --> 17:13.194
Keeping secrets, Hitler. We love art.

17:13.194 --> 17:14.724
- We love art... show us some.
- Show us.

17:14.726 --> 17:16.037
You want to see my art?

17:16.038 --> 17:17.132
- Yes!
- Yes, of course.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.218
We'd love to.

17:18.219 --> 17:19.529
Hitler, please.

17:22.431 --> 17:22.997
Oh.

17:23.137 --> 17:26.577
It is a boy who is eating the
jelly, butter, and peanut sandwich.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.260
Well, Hitler,

17:28.444 --> 17:32.581
I must say, this art...

17:34.299 --> 17:34.847
Stinks!

17:36.485 --> 17:38.785
Oh, it does. You are a bad artist.

17:38.786 --> 17:40.970
Were you using shit for ink?

17:40.971 --> 17:42.813
Because pee-yew.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.418
Mother says I show great promise.

17:45.419 --> 17:47.405
Oh, Mother is an idiot.

17:47.406 --> 17:50.396
Your mother should only
make one great promise.

17:50.397 --> 17:53.383
And that's to keep you
away from the art supplies.

17:58.384 --> 17:59.411
I hate you!

17:59.873 --> 18:00.908
I'm sorry,

18:00.909 --> 18:03.268
did you just say, "I hate Jew"?

18:03.269 --> 18:05.642
No. I said I hate you.

18:05.955 --> 18:07.299
You are terrible people!

18:07.300 --> 18:08.471
Just terrible!

18:09.264 --> 18:11.590
Now I know who I'd kill

18:11.591 --> 18:12.902
if I went back in time.

18:13.794 --> 18:15.027
Myself!

18:17.253 --> 18:19.512
Well, that was dramatic.

18:19.513 --> 18:22.341
I got it.

18:24.918 --> 18:27.921
And so, Helen Keller's final arrow,

18:27.922 --> 18:30.657
like the previous two, has failed

18:30.658 --> 18:32.350
to make not only the target,

18:32.351 --> 18:33.815
but that end of the field completely.

18:33.816 --> 18:35.504
I think this is perhaps because

18:35.739 --> 18:38.018
she is not a trained archer

18:38.019 --> 18:39.741
and, of course, she is as blind

18:39.742 --> 18:41.704
as a Louisiana bluesman.

18:41.899 --> 18:43.261
Which means all

18:43.519 --> 18:46.160
that Lillian Bellacourt must do now is

18:46.161 --> 18:49.476
simply hit the target at all to win.

18:52.691 --> 18:54.990
Stand down!

18:56.099 --> 18:57.331
Not today, Victor.

18:57.332 --> 18:58.636
It is verboten!

18:58.964 --> 19:01.917
Which is German for
"don't [bleep] do it!"

19:02.229 --> 19:04.109
Well, I don't speak German
because I'm a woman

19:04.110 --> 19:06.183
and no one ever bothered
to send me to school.

19:06.184 --> 19:07.490
Now, get out of the way.

19:07.943 --> 19:09.306
I won't get out of the way

19:09.634 --> 19:11.833
for you or any other woman.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.863
For you have made men the target.

19:14.282 --> 19:17.016
Do it, Lillian! End him!

19:20.710 --> 19:21.841
Get out of the way!

19:21.842 --> 19:23.542
You'll have to kill me first.

19:27.381 --> 19:29.515
Well, this isn't a hard decision at all.

19:36.224 --> 19:37.255
I won!

19:37.324 --> 19:39.025
I won! Where's my gold?

19:39.092 --> 19:40.659
Where's my gold?

19:40.727 --> 19:42.393
Oh, no. No, no, no.

19:42.463 --> 19:44.463
No, you see, you haven't
actually won anything yet.

19:44.532 --> 19:45.831
There's no gold?

19:45.900 --> 19:48.032
Well, no, no, but you have won

19:48.101 --> 19:51.602
the chance to compete
in the actual Olympics,

19:51.672 --> 19:53.153
which are, of course, in the far future.

19:53.154 --> 19:54.499
This isn't the Olympics?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.140
We're in Newport.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.710
These were the trials.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.380
But you have won the chance

20:00.448 --> 20:02.484
to represent women everywhere.

20:02.485 --> 20:04.250
But I don't care about women anywhere.

20:04.319 --> 20:05.283
Sorry, girls.

20:05.352 --> 20:06.418
Next stop,

20:06.487 --> 20:08.586
a no-expenses-paid trip

20:08.656 --> 20:10.955
to St. Louis, Missouri.

20:11.025 --> 20:13.056
That's right, opal of the Mississippi.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.961
Which happens to have
three two-star hotels,

20:15.028 --> 20:16.894
one of which is a riverboat.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.897
- Hm?
- St. Louis?

20:18.966 --> 20:20.265
Think of the catfish.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.400
- I could get scalped!
- Mm-hmm.

20:22.469 --> 20:24.868
I wouldn't be caught dead
in a rail-over state.

20:24.938 --> 20:26.237
Hm.

20:26.306 --> 20:27.640
I supposed Helen Keller wins.

20:27.707 --> 20:28.906
Tell her she won.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.332
_

21:01.975 --> 21:03.309
Oh. I'm sorry.

21:03.377 --> 21:05.476
I don't think we left it here either.

21:05.546 --> 21:07.579
Blanche, finish me off!

21:09.716 --> 21:11.315
Oh, [bleep], [bleep]!

21:13.823 --> 21:15.256
Thank you.
