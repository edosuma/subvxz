00:16.459 --> 00:18.908
Fear not, Kal-El.

00:18.908 --> 00:20.461
Who are you?

00:20.461 --> 00:23.161
I am Jor-El...

00:23.161 --> 00:24.847
your father.

00:24.847 --> 00:26.456
I thought you died!

00:26.456 --> 00:30.753
I am his memory, his will.

00:30.753 --> 00:36.479
I am to fulfill his promise and
guide you all the days of your life.

00:36.479 --> 00:39.584
You are the last son of Krypton.

00:39.584 --> 00:41.875
When you traveled through the cosmos,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.924
you carried the hopes and
dreams of your people.

00:44.924 --> 00:48.174
They now live through you, Kal-El.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.862
It is time.

00:49.862 --> 00:50.959
Time for what?

00:50.959 --> 00:54.585
Time to accept your destiny.

00:55.228 --> 00:58.065
I don't know what you have
in mind for me, but I--

00:58.065 --> 01:01.332
By the setting of the sun Sol,

01:01.332 --> 01:03.474
you will return to me.

01:03.474 --> 01:09.010
Your destiny will be fulfilled.

01:09.010 --> 01:12.914
Your thoughts are not
a mystery to me, Kal-El.

01:12.914 --> 01:16.815
These people have served their purpose.

01:16.815 --> 01:21.597
It is time to leave them.

01:26.656 --> 01:28.614
Please!

01:28.614 --> 01:32.532
Everything and everyone
I love is here! In Smallville!

01:32.532 --> 01:35.376
You must let go of your past.

01:35.376 --> 01:38.314
I will guide you to your future.

01:38.314 --> 01:41.954
No, I don't want your guidance!

01:41.954 --> 01:44.411
I want to create my own future!

01:44.411 --> 01:49.249
You have no choice, Kal-El.

02:57.989 --> 03:00.516
Well, you're up early.

03:00.516 --> 03:02.561
I never went to sleep.

03:02.561 --> 03:04.237
Clark?

03:04.237 --> 03:06.948
What's wrong?

03:08.465 --> 03:13.712
I kind of met my biological father last night.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.783
When I heard his voice,
it was coming from the ship.

03:24.783 --> 03:27.886
But it sounded like
it was from my own head.

03:27.886 --> 03:29.564
He said it was time.

03:29.564 --> 03:31.080
Said it was time for what?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.977
To leave Smallville and fulfill my destiny.

03:33.977 --> 03:36.910
He said that?

03:36.910 --> 03:38.620
I have until sundown today.

03:42.471 --> 03:45.161
He said I didn't have a choice.

03:45.161 --> 03:48.435
Why is it happening now when
my life is just coming together?

03:48.435 --> 03:52.064
The farm's out of debt,
I'm gonna be a big brother...

03:52.064 --> 03:54.547
Lana and I are finally getting together.

03:54.547 --> 03:59.288
Whatever your biological father
may have had in mind for you,

03:59.288 --> 04:03.990
they're his hopes and dreams,
not yours.

04:03.990 --> 04:08.368
Clark, you choose your own destiny.

04:08.368 --> 04:13.555
Nobody can decide that for you, son.

04:20.599 --> 04:23.585
This is my home.

04:23.585 --> 04:26.528
And you're my parents.

04:27.237 --> 04:32.741
It's where I belong, and
I'm not going anywhere.

05:03.669 --> 05:06.980
I haven't seen you two
together since, um,

05:06.980 --> 05:10.127
well Dad, since you tried to
bribe Helen into dumping me.

05:10.127 --> 05:15.847
And now Dr. Bryce refuses to accept this,
my wedding gift to her.

05:15.847 --> 05:22.678
If you two, uh, star-crossed
lovers will excuse me.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.427
You, uh, you want to tell me
what that was all about?

05:26.427 --> 05:29.473
Exactly what your father said.

05:29.473 --> 05:35.943
You know what? I'm tired of being
a pawn in this never-ending struggle.

05:35.943 --> 05:39.683
We both said some things last night.

05:39.683 --> 05:44.062
I don't want to go into this marriage
with any secrets between us.

05:44.062 --> 05:48.808
I haven't held anything back.

06:00.897 --> 06:02.701
I have.

06:02.701 --> 06:05.277
Look inside.

06:12.261 --> 06:15.217
I did break into your office,

06:15.217 --> 06:19.529
and that's what I was after.

06:19.529 --> 06:22.764
I told you because
I'm trying to break the cycle.

06:22.764 --> 06:25.729
I don't want to be the person
who did this anymore.

06:25.729 --> 06:30.065
But you did do it, Lex.
You committed a crime.

06:30.065 --> 06:33.074
You violated my privacy
and that of my patients.

06:33.074 --> 06:34.073
I know.

06:34.073 --> 06:35.555
What did you think would happen?

06:35.555 --> 06:37.969
That you'd give it back,
tell me what you did, and

06:37.969 --> 06:42.136
I'd just forgive you and
we would live happily ever after?

06:42.136 --> 06:45.025
I don't know what I expected.

06:45.025 --> 06:48.068
All I know is that I love you.

06:48.355 --> 06:53.682
I'm sure in some part of
that twisted mind you do.

06:53.682 --> 06:57.984
I didn't have it analyzed.

07:01.985 --> 07:07.061
What was so important
about this blood, anyway?

07:07.061 --> 07:11.296
I thought it would give me
the answers I've been looking for.

07:11.296 --> 07:18.382
All it did was end this relationship.

07:33.392 --> 07:35.759
Are you okay?

07:38.146 --> 07:41.825
Yeah, I'm great.

07:43.894 --> 07:50.710
You know, I can always tell when
you're being less than truthful.

07:52.390 --> 07:55.121
It's just that...

07:55.121 --> 08:01.321
I've waited for this
for so long, for us.

08:01.699 --> 08:04.706
I just don't want it to go away.

08:04.706 --> 08:07.657
I'm not going anywhere.

08:09.483 --> 08:13.713
Neither am I.

08:26.721 --> 08:34.116
So, uh, does this mean you're
officially my date to Lex's wedding?

08:34.582 --> 08:41.524
Only after we officially tell Chloe
about our change in status.

08:42.033 --> 08:47.538
Clark, I've been avoiding her all day.

08:50.273 --> 08:53.266
All right, just let me tell her.

08:53.266 --> 08:59.070
Chloe and I agreed that we'd be
upfront about things like this.

08:59.690 --> 09:06.498
Well, I'm sure if we're
honest, she'll be fine.

09:18.566 --> 09:22.298
I never realized the small town
press could be so pithy.

09:22.298 --> 09:24.550
What do you think your father's up to?

09:24.550 --> 09:29.723
Apparently he's already got a team working overtime
installing some pretty sophisticated machinery down there.

09:29.723 --> 09:31.843
What for?

09:31.843 --> 09:36.840
I wish I could tell you, but I'm the last person
he'd ever let back into those caves.

09:36.840 --> 09:42.427
He's tightened security.
I doubt even you'll be able to get past.

09:43.638 --> 09:48.123
Uh, where's this tailor?
I'm kind of pressed for time today.

09:48.123 --> 09:50.492
I canceled him.

09:50.816 --> 09:52.378
Why?

09:52.378 --> 09:56.366
Because Helen's not walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

09:57.167 --> 10:00.761
I saw her last night.
She seemed really happy.

10:00.761 --> 10:02.286
Yeah, well,

10:02.286 --> 10:04.738
a lot can change in 24 hours.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.978
Why'd she break it off?

10:09.189 --> 10:12.339
I've always been fighting my destiny,

10:12.339 --> 10:14.923
trying to avoid becoming my father.

10:14.923 --> 10:21.481
But we all have certain genes that, no matter
how much we want to change, dominate us.

10:21.481 --> 10:24.558
What'd you do?

10:24.558 --> 10:27.509
I betrayed Helen's trust.

10:28.967 --> 10:34.314
Then I fought my own nature and
did something very unLuthor-like.

10:34.314 --> 10:40.351
I confessed my sin,
hoping she'd forgive me.

10:40.351 --> 10:44.991
My guess is she didn't.

10:45.268 --> 10:47.710
Don't tell anyone, Clark.

10:47.710 --> 10:54.220
I want to hold onto my romantic
notions for one more day.

11:20.859 --> 11:24.502
I'm gonna have to put a stop
to these unauthorized visits.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.697
Mr. Luthor.

11:26.697 --> 11:29.232
What are you doing here?

11:29.232 --> 11:31.557
I was just curious.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.585
I suppose so.

11:35.585 --> 11:41.180
According to poor Dr. Walden, you're
talked about quite a bit on these walls.

11:41.180 --> 11:45.220
Apparently you are going to rule us all.

11:45.220 --> 11:49.432
I'm surprised someone like you, Mr. Luthor,
would put stock in anything he had to say.

11:49.432 --> 11:52.602
I know you worked closely
with the man, Clark.

11:52.602 --> 11:59.517
I'm sure there are insights you could give me.
It would be extremely helpful.

11:59.517 --> 12:04.125
- He didn't tell me anything.
- Hmm.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.613
What's with all the machinery?

12:10.330 --> 12:18.236
I'm going to unlock the secrets
hidden in these walls.

12:19.011 --> 12:22.193
Didn't you see what happened
to Dr. Walden? It's dangerous.

12:22.193 --> 12:26.329
Yes, but I have something
he didn't. The key.

12:26.329 --> 12:32.005
Once I insert that key into the slot,

12:32.005 --> 12:37.479
I'm convinced the answers
will be revealed to me.

12:37.479 --> 12:40.152
I don't understand. I thought the
key was stolen from your vault.

12:40.152 --> 12:46.185
It was, but before it mysteriously
disappeared, I had it analyzed.

12:46.185 --> 12:50.524
The composition was unique.

12:50.524 --> 12:56.137
There's nothing like it on Earth,
with one exception.

12:57.306 --> 13:02.540
The meteor rocks
found here in Smallville.

13:02.540 --> 13:09.234
So I have fashioned my own key.

13:10.075 --> 13:16.336
It's identical in every detail.

13:16.336 --> 13:21.839
Isn't it beautiful?
Look.

13:22.074 --> 13:23.718
Clark?

13:23.718 --> 13:27.736
You don't look well.
Are you all right?

13:27.736 --> 13:29.750
I'm fine.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.625
Just...

13:32.625 --> 13:34.852
be careful.

13:34.852 --> 13:39.723
Lionel Luthor's never gotten
anywhere in life playing it safe.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.743
I'm sure you'll render Clark speechless.

13:53.743 --> 13:54.892
Chloe, hi.

13:54.892 --> 13:58.566
Be careful you two don't upstage
the bride and groom.

13:58.566 --> 13:59.731
What do you mean?

13:59.731 --> 14:02.525
You two are going together,
I assume.

14:02.525 --> 14:05.828
Yeah, yeah.
As friends.

14:05.828 --> 14:10.004
Right. Friends.

14:10.730 --> 14:13.697
Have you seen Clark?
He's been looking for you.

14:13.697 --> 14:16.057
No. Uh, I've been trying to
track him down all day,

14:16.057 --> 14:21.337
but his parents said that he
was mired in best man duties.

14:21.337 --> 14:25.037
Uh, when did you see him last?

14:25.037 --> 14:28.404
Oh, um, I ran into him
at the Talon. He, uh,

14:28.404 --> 14:30.619
wanted to talk to you,
said it was important.

14:30.619 --> 14:34.055
Well, I guess it couldn't be
as important as you thought.

14:34.055 --> 14:37.027
Have fun tomorrow.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.944
I figured this is where I'd find you.

14:57.353 --> 15:00.254
Just watching the sunset.

15:00.563 --> 15:03.515
I hope it's not the last one
I see from up here.

15:03.515 --> 15:06.362
It won't be, Clark.

15:06.563 --> 15:10.811
Son, it's just another sundown.

15:31.395 --> 15:34.360
Come on. Your mother's
got dinner ready.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.443
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.543
Dad?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.794
Yeah.

15:46.619 --> 15:51.032
Thanks for always believing in me.

15:51.795 --> 15:56.142
You're welcome, son.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.234
It is time, Kal-El.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.472
Come to me.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.110
You will obey me, Kal-El.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.920
You're not my father.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.918
I won't let you control me.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.496
This is the mark of your ancestors.

16:47.496 --> 16:50.758
You cannot fight it, Kal-El.

16:50.758 --> 16:57.095
At the zenith of the star Sol,
you will begin your journey.

17:01.427 --> 17:03.473
If you do not,

17:03.473 --> 17:08.030
you will hurt the ones
you love most.

17:24.338 --> 17:28.537
Clark! Why aren't you ready?

17:28.537 --> 17:31.081
The wedding doesn't start for a few hours.

17:31.081 --> 17:32.593
Your mother wants to get a good seat, son.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.104
I promised Helen I'd go
early and check the flowers.

17:36.104 --> 17:38.647
Well, I gotta pick up Lana,
so I'll meet you there.

17:38.647 --> 17:44.145
We obviously have to get used
to the fact that you have a girlfriend now.

17:47.412 --> 17:49.686
Clark.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.374
How's it going today, son?

17:52.374 --> 17:53.817
Good.

17:53.817 --> 17:56.254
No voice?

17:56.254 --> 17:57.066
No voice.

17:57.066 --> 17:59.834
Looks like you're just gonna have to
face the future the old-fashioned way.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.470
I guess so. It's pretty scary.

18:02.470 --> 18:05.265
Yeah.

18:05.446 --> 18:06.754
Mom?

18:06.754 --> 18:08.836
Yes.

18:09.215 --> 18:12.184
You look beautiful today.

18:12.184 --> 18:15.948
Thank you, sweetheart.

18:36.598 --> 18:38.303
Helen.

18:39.707 --> 18:40.683
You're here.

18:40.683 --> 18:43.512
I am so angry at you.

18:43.512 --> 18:46.296
What you did was unforgivable.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.228
You're right.

18:47.228 --> 18:51.773
But the farther I got
from you and this town...

18:51.773 --> 18:57.049
I realized that while any sane
person would've kept driving,

18:57.049 --> 18:59.670
I needed to turn around.

18:59.670 --> 19:06.405
I started to look at myself and the
mistakes that I've made in my life.

19:06.731 --> 19:08.942
I hope I'm not one of them.

19:08.942 --> 19:13.943
No, Lex, you're not.

19:13.943 --> 19:17.043
That's the thing.

19:17.433 --> 19:22.630
I still love you.

19:25.836 --> 19:28.393
Oh, man.

19:29.578 --> 19:30.749
Does it hurt?

19:30.749 --> 19:33.238
No. Not now.

19:33.403 --> 19:36.503
You got any idea what it means?

19:37.021 --> 19:41.096
It's my biological father's way of telling me I have to do what he wants.

19:41.096 --> 19:45.295
I'm afraid by noon, it'll control me.

19:45.295 --> 19:49.360
Your parents must be freaked out.

19:50.784 --> 19:53.849
I didn't tell them.

19:53.849 --> 19:55.575
Why wouldn't you tell them, Clark?

19:55.575 --> 19:58.556
Because, Pete,
I know what I have to do.

19:58.556 --> 20:02.829
They'll never agree with me
in a million years.

20:02.829 --> 20:05.194
I have to destroy the ship.

20:05.194 --> 20:06.654
What?

20:06.654 --> 20:08.659
Clark, no.

20:08.659 --> 20:10.857
This thing traveled millions
of miles through space.

20:10.857 --> 20:13.123
I don't think we can dent it,
much less destroy it.

20:13.123 --> 20:15.382
What if we had a Kryptonite key?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.386
Clark, this is whacked!

20:17.386 --> 20:19.109
Pete...

20:19.109 --> 20:20.686
do you remember Lana's necklace?

20:20.686 --> 20:22.535
Yeah, but what's that have to
do with destroying the ship?

20:22.535 --> 20:26.236
Everything, Pete. When Tina Grier tied
me up down here, it nearly killed me.

20:26.236 --> 20:30.000
But before it could,
the ship neutralized it.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.862
You said the ship was protecting you

20:31.862 --> 20:34.961
What if it's actually protecting itself?

20:34.961 --> 20:36.783
Think about it, Pete.

20:36.783 --> 20:41.779
I'm from Krypton and so is this ship and
what's the one thing that can kill me?

20:41.779 --> 20:46.487
So you're thinking that Kryptonite
can destroy the ship.

20:47.832 --> 20:50.846
Clark, it's too dangerous.

20:50.846 --> 20:54.910
Do you hear me? You've never done
this before. You don't know what'll happen.

20:54.910 --> 20:59.576
It could kill you.

21:01.364 --> 21:07.208
Besides, where are we gonna
get a Kryptonite key?

21:15.516 --> 21:16.794
How much longer now?

21:16.794 --> 21:19.285
- Another ten minutes.
- Another ten minutes.

21:19.285 --> 21:21.492
Hey, Luthor!

21:21.492 --> 21:23.153
I got something to say to you!

21:23.153 --> 21:26.768
Security, get him out of here.

21:26.768 --> 21:28.540
Get off me!

21:28.540 --> 21:32.438
If these guys don't let me go I'm gonna lay a lawsuit
on you so fast it's gonna make your head spin.

21:32.438 --> 21:34.462
All right, all right, I'll talk him.

21:34.462 --> 21:35.618
Do I know you?

21:35.618 --> 21:36.921
Name's Pete Ross.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.736
Ross, Ross, Ross.

21:38.736 --> 21:42.011
As in Ross Creamed Corn.
You stole my family's business.

21:42.011 --> 21:45.291
Yes. I overpaid for that
ramshackle old factory.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.321
Nobody in this town likes you!

21:47.321 --> 21:48.680
Don't touch me.
You know you hate him.

21:48.680 --> 21:53.900
I know that, but I value their hatred.
I find it very useful.

21:53.900 --> 21:59.917
You see, people are always
at their weakest when they're angry.

21:59.917 --> 22:03.332
Ask you father.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.528
I'll do that.

22:08.528 --> 22:12.880
Get him out.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.729
No...

22:20.729 --> 22:23.033
no...

22:23.033 --> 22:26.624
NOOO!!!

22:26.624 --> 22:28.348
You--

22:28.348 --> 22:30.667
Search him. Search him.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.465
Search me?
What are you doing?

22:32.465 --> 22:35.689
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

22:35.689 --> 22:38.532
Careful, Mr. Luthor.

22:38.737 --> 22:43.233
You wouldn't want to look weak.

22:48.724 --> 22:50.625
Lex.

22:51.881 --> 22:54.169
Mr. and Mrs. Kent.

22:54.169 --> 22:55.938
Where's the, uh, best man?

22:55.938 --> 23:01.543
Well, you know Clark and punctuality have
never been on the best terms, but he'll be here.

23:01.543 --> 23:03.988
I got you something.

23:10.443 --> 23:11.721
A compass.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.501
Yeah, it's a Kent family tradition.

23:13.501 --> 23:15.742
My father gave me one on our wedding day,

23:15.742 --> 23:19.708
just in case I got lost going down the aisle.

23:19.708 --> 23:22.690
Thank you, Mr. Kent.

23:29.467 --> 23:32.741
Why aren't you dressed?

23:32.921 --> 23:35.948
Wow.

23:58.929 --> 24:01.519
Um,

24:02.340 --> 24:04.502
there's something I have to do first.

24:04.502 --> 24:06.606
What?

24:07.423 --> 24:10.322
I can't tell you.

24:10.322 --> 24:14.791
Just know it's for us
and our future.

24:15.667 --> 24:22.558
Last time a guy said that to me,
um, he went off to war.

24:27.777 --> 24:30.280
You should go.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.826
I'll meet you there.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.598
Are you sure you're all right?

24:46.598 --> 24:48.579
Yeah.

24:50.332 --> 24:52.654
Go.

24:52.654 --> 24:55.337
Okay.

25:00.335 --> 25:01.669
Lana, I--

25:01.669 --> 25:04.116
Yeah?

25:04.116 --> 25:08.053
I just wanted to remember this moment.

25:45.927 --> 25:47.373
Any word on Clark?

25:47.373 --> 25:49.469
Helen's already circled
the church five times.

25:49.469 --> 25:52.240
He was coming with Lana.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.206
Lana, where's Clark?

25:58.206 --> 25:59.873
He said he had something to do.

25:59.873 --> 26:03.437
It seemed important.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.296
- Mr. Kent.
- I'm sorry, Lex.

26:06.296 --> 26:08.582
It looks like you're gonna have to start
your wedding without your best man.

26:08.582 --> 26:09.486
We can wait.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.712
Hey, don't worry about Clark.

26:11.712 --> 26:17.534
You have far more important
things to do here. Good luck.

26:29.732 --> 26:35.672
Hey, Clark, I'm glad I caught
you before the wedding.

26:35.672 --> 26:36.979
Chloe, what are you doing here?

26:36.979 --> 26:39.455
Is everything okay? I mean,
I heard you were looking for me.

26:39.455 --> 26:43.047
Yeah, um, I was, but...

26:43.047 --> 26:44.779
I can't talk to you right now.

26:44.779 --> 26:46.738
- What are you doing?
- Look, I promise I'll find you later.

26:46.738 --> 26:50.681
- Clark, I--
- Don't worry. I'll find you, okay?

26:51.061 --> 26:53.382
So how'd you decide?

26:53.382 --> 26:57.266
Rock-paper-scissors, coin toss, or did
you just happen to draw the short straw?

26:57.266 --> 26:58.532
Decide?

26:58.532 --> 27:03.423
Who was gonna tell me that
you and Lana are together.

27:03.511 --> 27:04.942
You know?

27:04.942 --> 27:09.162
Yeah. I came over to the barn the other
night to warn you about something.

27:09.162 --> 27:11.008
About what?

27:11.008 --> 27:12.431
You know, it doesn't matter now.

27:12.431 --> 27:16.063
The point is I saw you and
Lana in a major lip lock.

27:16.063 --> 27:19.377
- I-I didn't mean--
- Didn't what, Clark?

27:19.377 --> 27:24.117
Newsflash. You've always
been in love with Lana.

27:24.117 --> 27:28.011
I tried to deny it, thinking that maybe
we could work something out, but

27:28.011 --> 27:29.847
it's like fate, Clark.

27:29.847 --> 27:32.379
Inevitable, but always surprising
when it actually happens.

27:32.379 --> 27:34.363
- I was gonna tell you.
- Really?

27:34.363 --> 27:38.388
Because obviously it was
on the top of your to-do list.

27:38.884 --> 27:41.578
You know, I can deal with the fact
that you guys are together.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.523
It hurts, but I was prepared for it.

27:43.523 --> 27:46.970
But we just made a promise
to be honest with each other,

27:46.970 --> 27:49.907
and you didn't have the
guts to keep you word!

27:49.907 --> 27:50.311
Chloe--

27:50.311 --> 27:55.260
Or was it just that it was too much fun making a
fool of me that you couldn't reveal your secret?

27:55.260 --> 27:58.685
Have a nice life, Clark.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.096
Mr. and Mrs. Luthor, welcome aboard.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.711
It'll be a couple of minutes
before we can take off.

30:32.711 --> 30:34.725
The tower's generator just kicked in.

30:34.725 --> 30:37.047
Seems the whole county suffered
some sort of power failure.

30:37.047 --> 30:41.444
Good. It'll mask our get away.

31:45.119 --> 31:48.644
To our new life.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.821
What's the matter?

31:53.821 --> 31:55.677
Nothing.

31:55.677 --> 31:58.971
Everything's perfect.

32:16.199 --> 32:17.816
How is she?

32:17.816 --> 32:20.817
Doctors don't know yet.

32:23.132 --> 32:26.430
What did you do, Clark?

32:29.264 --> 32:32.006
I stole Lionel's Kryptonite key.

32:32.006 --> 32:35.530
I put it in the ship.

32:37.819 --> 32:41.957
And why did you do that?

32:42.761 --> 32:46.290
Dad, I lied about the voice.

32:46.290 --> 32:53.678
It did come back. It told me
I had to leave by noon.

32:53.678 --> 32:56.538
I didn't have a choice, Dad.

32:56.538 --> 32:58.591
I had to destroy the ship.

32:58.591 --> 33:02.871
Why didn't you tell us?

33:02.871 --> 33:07.810
I knew you wouldn't
agree with what I did.

33:09.988 --> 33:15.079
Dad, I didn't want it to
take me away from you.

33:15.366 --> 33:17.258
I'm so sorry for what I did.

33:17.258 --> 33:20.267
Your actions have consequences, Clark.

33:20.267 --> 33:22.029
Didn't your mother and I
ever teach you that?

33:22.029 --> 33:25.678
- Yes, but--
- There's no time for excuses, Clark.

33:25.678 --> 33:27.650
It's too late.

33:27.650 --> 33:30.388
You didn't think this thing through.

33:30.388 --> 33:33.928
You had no idea what was
gonna happen, and now...

33:33.928 --> 33:39.434
Now your mother is lying
in a hospital bed.

33:40.256 --> 33:43.627
Mr. Kent?

33:50.677 --> 33:53.100
Doctor, how is my wife?

33:53.100 --> 33:58.674
She has a mild concussion,
but she'll be fine.

33:59.315 --> 34:03.021
And how is our baby?

34:03.021 --> 34:06.852
I'm sorry.

34:13.771 --> 34:17.040
Dad....

34:43.937 --> 34:46.902
Clark, what happened?

34:46.902 --> 34:50.679
Looks like a bomb went off.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.261
Where are your parents?

34:53.261 --> 34:56.822
Hospital.

34:57.080 --> 35:00.755
They're fine.

35:00.755 --> 35:03.957
My mom lost the baby.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.950
The baby?

35:06.950 --> 35:10.798
This is all my fault, Lana.
I did this.

35:10.798 --> 35:12.967
How could you do this?

35:12.967 --> 35:15.959
The same way I always do.

35:15.959 --> 35:18.624
I bring pain and suffering
to everyone's lives.

35:18.624 --> 35:19.713
Clark, that's not true.

35:19.713 --> 35:21.892
Yes, Lana, it is.

35:21.892 --> 35:24.608
Lana, I've kept so much from you.

35:24.608 --> 35:28.515
If you knew the truth,
you'd never talk to me again.

35:28.515 --> 35:31.915
I don't believe that.

35:32.924 --> 35:37.675
I tried to cover up my past
and push it away.

35:37.675 --> 35:42.229
I-I couldn't.

35:45.443 --> 35:50.982
He said if I didn't go,
everyone I love would be hurt.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.619
He was right.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.447
Clark, you're in shock.

35:56.447 --> 36:00.901
- You're not making any--
- No, Lana, stay from me.

36:00.901 --> 36:04.933
Stay away from me
before I hurt you too.

36:19.573 --> 36:24.052
I'm glad you finally decided
to accept my offer.

36:24.052 --> 36:30.351
You know, don't you, you have a very
exciting future ahead of you, Miss Sullivan.

36:30.351 --> 36:33.922
Well, opportunities like this aren't
dropped on your doorstep every day.

36:33.922 --> 36:36.962
Why the sudden change of heart?

36:36.962 --> 36:39.157
You were right about Clark.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.097
He wasn't who I thought he was.

36:41.097 --> 36:42.494
Oh.

36:42.494 --> 36:44.649
I'm surprised I hadn't noticed earlier.

36:44.649 --> 36:47.294
So much for my crack journalistic instinct.

36:47.294 --> 36:51.810
No, no, love has a way of blinding
even the sharpest minds.

36:51.810 --> 36:55.255
We don't look because
we don't want to see.

36:55.255 --> 36:58.360
But once love has been stripped away,

36:58.360 --> 37:01.467
then we see the real person clearly.

37:01.467 --> 37:07.628
They're revealed to us with
all their flaws, their foibles,

37:07.628 --> 37:11.791
and their secrets.

37:12.159 --> 37:15.324
Oh, I've got a meeting.

37:15.324 --> 37:19.650
- I'm sorry to rush you out like this.
- It's fine.

37:19.650 --> 37:21.303
Mr. Luthor?

37:21.303 --> 37:23.873
Why are you so interested in Clark?

37:23.873 --> 37:29.015
You don't expect me to show
you all my cards, now do you?

37:29.015 --> 37:33.086
No, I guess not.

37:33.737 --> 37:36.551
All will be revealed in good time, Miss Sullivan.

37:36.551 --> 37:39.389
Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

37:56.822 --> 37:59.606
I'm here, sweetheart.

37:59.980 --> 38:02.896
I'm here.

38:32.573 --> 38:36.427
Clark. I've been looking all over for you.
I heard what happened.

38:36.427 --> 38:38.598
What, are you here to tell me
I screwed up in some major way?

38:38.598 --> 38:41.583
No. Hey, listen, I'm sorry
and I want to help.

38:41.583 --> 38:46.477
It's too late for that, Pete.
No one can help me now.

38:48.169 --> 38:50.048
Clark, what are you looking for?

38:50.048 --> 38:52.694
I know Chloe kept one of those red
Kryptonite rings around here somewhere.

38:52.694 --> 38:54.520
Yeah, well, what do you want it for?
You know what it does to you.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.636
Yeah. It makes me feel better.

38:56.636 --> 38:59.646
That's not the answer, Clark.

39:00.359 --> 39:01.877
I saw Lana.

39:01.877 --> 39:05.616
I heard what happened
to your mom's baby.

39:05.616 --> 39:07.031
Clark, you need to talk to your folks.

39:07.031 --> 39:10.142
I did talk to my parents, Pete!

39:10.142 --> 39:12.540
You should have seen
the way my dad looked at me.

39:12.540 --> 39:14.093
It was like I was an alien.

39:14.093 --> 39:19.872
If I'd have done what I should've in the
beginning, none of this would have happened.

39:30.395 --> 39:33.989
Clark, don't do it. When you put
that ring on, you're not yourself.

39:33.989 --> 39:38.179
Exactly what I don't want
to be right now, Pete.

39:42.791 --> 39:45.782
Clark!

39:52.402 --> 39:55.244
Clark, where are you going?

39:56.619 --> 39:59.326
Away from here.

39:59.619 --> 40:01.745
The Clark Kent I know wouldn't
run away from his problems.

40:01.745 --> 40:04.817
The Clark Kent you know is a lie.

40:04.817 --> 40:06.415
Why won't you let me in?

40:06.415 --> 40:10.343
Because, Lana, you
won't like what you see.

40:13.404 --> 40:17.284
- I am not giving up on you.
- No on can save me.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.176
Not even you.

40:18.176 --> 40:20.697
Your parents need you.

40:20.697 --> 40:23.910
I need you.

40:28.456 --> 40:32.974
I love you, Clark.

40:33.389 --> 40:38.097
I love you, too...

40:39.339 --> 40:43.161
more than you'll ever know.

40:43.161 --> 40:48.517
That's why I have to leave.

41:06.303 --> 41:09.401
Come with me.

41:09.401 --> 41:13.892
Smallville's my home.
It's your home too.
