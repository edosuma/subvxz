WEBVTT

00:32.409 --> 00:34.990
Looking good, Santa.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.990
Hey, Santa. Here we go.

00:49.370 --> 00:51.330
Rosy cheeks.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.990
Rosy nose.
Oh, that's rosy, okay.

01:32.620 --> 01:36.080
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.660
Hey, not bad, Santa.

01:45.990 --> 01:49.660
What can I bring
you for Christmas?

01:49.660 --> 01:51.830
[voices chattering]

01:58.540 --> 02:02.290
That puppy will be
there Christmas morning.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.660
So get up early or it'll
poop under the tree okay?

02:04.660 --> 02:07.910
Now grab your candy cane
and have a great Christmas.

02:08.620 --> 02:11.990
Come here, little girl.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.790
[groans]

02:13.790 --> 02:15.080
Whoa, it's not
New Year's Eve yet.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.990
Whew!

02:16.990 --> 02:18.500
Okay, so I have written
some things down.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.990
[sighs]

02:22.990 --> 02:24.120
I want a mansion in Cali,

02:24.120 --> 02:25.990
but not the ones in the city.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.990
I want one on the mountainside,
maybe with a pool,
palm trees around it.

02:27.990 --> 02:31.540
And a three-car garage.

02:31.540 --> 02:32.870
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.830
Whoa!

02:40.990 --> 02:44.580
- Man.
- [girl] What?

02:44.580 --> 02:46.990
Come on, you know,
you suck at baseball.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.790
Shut up, Zoe.

02:49.790 --> 02:50.910
You know that I got
all the brains

02:50.910 --> 02:52.160
and athletic ability
in this family.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.000
You just got hit
with the ugly stick.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.290
Okay, no you don't,
and do you want to get
hit with this instead?

02:56.290 --> 02:58.990
- No. You must be adopted.
- Adopted? I'm not adopted.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.290
- I'm not adopted!
- Mother, look at those
two children fighting.

03:05.290 --> 03:08.500
- Adopted, really?
- I see that, Cedric.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.450
- I would never do that.
- Of course you wouldn't, honey.

03:11.450 --> 03:14.290
I'm not adopted.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.580
Yes, you are, by circus freaks.

03:15.580 --> 03:17.910
Those parents need to
control their children better.

03:17.910 --> 03:20.660
Clearly they don't provide
the type of parental guidance

03:20.660 --> 03:23.120
needed to raise
a child properly.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.080
Wow, wow, wow, circus freaks.
Shut up!

03:25.080 --> 03:27.200
Circus elephants.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.910
Shut up, is that a fat joke?

03:28.910 --> 03:30.620
Yes!

03:30.620 --> 03:31.830
- You guys.
- Oh, my God!

03:31.830 --> 03:32.870
Zoe, Eric please stop, okay.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.580
Otherwise, we're not
going to see Santa.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.000
Alright, come on.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.410
Eric this is all your fault.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.700
Ho, ho, ho and off
you go young lady.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.990
I'll see what I can
do Christmas morning. Next!

03:44.990 --> 03:47.040
Hello, young man.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.790
You're a little too tall
for this line,
but let's talk about it.

03:48.790 --> 03:51.620
Oh, I want a monkey
that can speak Spanish.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.410
- Okay, what's your name?
- Justin.

03:54.410 --> 03:56.790
The problem with monkeys,

03:56.790 --> 03:57.990
they don't really speak
a language that we know.

03:57.990 --> 04:01.000
They speak Monkey.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.040
I thought they
could do anything.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.870
No, they can only
speak Monkey and climb.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.990
But I'll tell ya what I'll do.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.910
I'll bring ya a monkey
who speaks Monkey.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.410
- Oh, for real?
- It'll be there
Christmas morning.

04:10.410 --> 04:13.290
- Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
- Thank you.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.910
Grab your candy cane.
Come on, young lady.

04:15.910 --> 04:18.790
I am so excited to see Santa!

04:18.790 --> 04:20.450
[chuckling]

04:20.450 --> 04:21.700
That's fantastic,
I'm so glad we came.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.990
This is so lame.
I don't want to be here.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.660
I don't want to sit
on that bozo's lap

04:26.660 --> 04:29.040
with his fake beard
and polyester suit.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.790
Not fake, not polyester.
Come on, Sarah.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.870
Come on, Drake,
this is lame, man.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.990
What, you afraid you're gonna
be on Santa's naughty list?

04:37.990 --> 04:40.160
No, shut up.
I'm sayin' I got better
things to do with my time.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.500
- Yeah, like what?
- Yeah, like what?

04:44.620 --> 04:48.370
But, sweetheart,
you've always liked Santa.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.120
News flash, kiddos,
Santa isn't real!

04:51.120 --> 04:54.450
Oh, really?

04:54.450 --> 04:56.200
But you're gonna sit on his
lap and you're gonna love it.

04:56.410 --> 04:59.990
Alright, whatever, dude.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.410
Look, man, just because
you don't have a life
doesn't mean I don't.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.160
Then leave.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.250
- Look, man,
I was just tryin' to--
- No, leave.

05:09.250 --> 05:12.370
No one's stopping you.

05:12.370 --> 05:13.990
Why did you even
drag us here, mother?

05:15.540 --> 05:18.700
He's a little old
for Santa, okay?

05:18.700 --> 05:22.540
I could be doing so
much more with my time.

05:29.660 --> 05:33.540
And, what would you like
for Christmas, Victoria?

05:33.540 --> 05:37.540
A pony with a
diamond-lined saddle.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.750
The problem with animals
is we have to check
with the parents.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.620
And what can I do for you?

05:43.620 --> 05:44.950
I want a swimming pool
for Christmas.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.830
A swimming pool? We have a
problem with a swimming pool,

05:46.830 --> 05:50.250
I can't fit it in the sleigh.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.080
I really, really
want a baby brother.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.910
You really want a baby brother.
Well, the thing about that,
you gotta talk to mom and dad.

05:55.990 --> 05:59.330
Santa can't help.

05:59.330 --> 06:00.990
I would like to
understand women.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.370
You'd like to
understand women.

06:02.370 --> 06:03.950
I will bring you a book.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.330
I really want a
palace on a cloud.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.870
The problem with
a palace on a cloud,

06:07.870 --> 06:09.540
I can't get it in the sleigh.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.450
A gigantic pink limo
with a mini mall inside.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.660
- It won't fit in the sleigh.
- [girl] A pet dinosaur.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.830
The problem with dinosaurs
is they're extinct.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.990
- I would like a time machine.
- A private jet.

06:20.990 --> 06:23.990
Private islands
don't fit in sleighs.

06:23.990 --> 06:26.990
You're such an idiot!

06:26.990 --> 06:28.790
I better get what
I want this year, Santa.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.750
- I hate Christmas.
- You let me down last year!

06:30.750 --> 06:33.870
I'm so done.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.160
If I don't get what I want,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.750
All I can promise you is,
I'll see what I can do.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.990
- Thank you, Santa.
- Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.410
- Come on, young lady.
- Hi, Santa.

06:50.990 --> 06:53.450
- What's your name?
- I'm Cacie.

06:53.450 --> 06:55.500
- Cacie, lovely name.
- Thanks.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.080
What would you like
for Christmas, Cacie?

06:57.080 --> 06:58.500
Well, I really wanna
get my braces off.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.290
[farting noise]

07:00.290 --> 07:02.990
No, no, that was not me.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.870
I don't, that's not--

07:04.870 --> 07:06.660
Everyone does it,
Cacie, it's okay. What else?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.580
- Well, I also--
- [farting noise]

07:10.410 --> 07:11.990
Cacie, are you
serious right now?

07:14.040 --> 07:17.160
He's not even real.

07:18.040 --> 07:18.990
I...

07:21.250 --> 07:22.580
It's a fake Santa, get him!

07:23.700 --> 07:25.370
I'm real, I just don't have a--

07:25.370 --> 07:27.990
[all yelling]

07:27.990 --> 07:30.540
Everybody settle down!

07:30.790 --> 07:32.830
This is Christmas,
not a wrestling match!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.910
Okay, that's it!

07:41.990 --> 07:43.700
[beeping]

07:46.000 --> 07:46.990
Good Gobstoppers.

07:49.450 --> 07:51.160
- What, what is it, Tiny?
- Uh, nothing Diva.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.910
It's not from Corky.

07:53.910 --> 07:56.870
Guys, Tiny's got
a video from Corky!

07:58.330 --> 08:00.040
You do realize that
this is it, right?

08:02.040 --> 08:05.160
[all] Yeah.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.160
If we pull the trigger
on this, right here, right now,

08:07.160 --> 08:10.830
we could go on strike!

08:10.830 --> 08:12.950
Junior, send out the code!

08:12.950 --> 08:14.370
Code 33, I repeat, it's code 33!

08:14.370 --> 08:17.290
[yelling]

08:22.410 --> 08:25.750
Bye, bye.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.250
[chatter and yelling]

08:38.659 --> 08:41.990
I'm so sorry, Santa.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.910
Diva, no!

08:55.910 --> 08:57.330
Are you guys really just
going to leave Santa

08:59.250 --> 09:01.620
in his most critical
time of need?

09:01.620 --> 09:03.500
That's how it's done, Tiny.
Otherwise, we lose our leverage!

09:03.950 --> 09:07.790
I'm not striking.
I'm gonna stay with Santa.

09:07.790 --> 09:10.450
Typical Santa sympathizer.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.000
Are you guys just gonna leave?

09:13.990 --> 09:18.000
What about all the nice kids?
What about Christmas?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.500
It's nothing personal!

09:21.990 --> 09:24.330
Where's Junior? Do we have
notice to old jelly-belly ready?

09:30.910 --> 09:34.160
Put Saint Fuzzy Pants
on the screen.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.120
[beeping]
[line ringing]

09:43.990 --> 09:47.990
Why am I not surprised
to hear from you, Diva?

09:47.990 --> 09:51.540
You always seem
to make your demands
at the most critical time.

09:51.990 --> 09:55.790
I gave you a Vision
and Dental last year.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.660
I can't imagine what
it's gonna be this time.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.080
This is more than
just a demand, Santa.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.120
- Shut up.
- She's right,
it's bigger this time.

10:04.790 --> 10:08.080
It's different!

10:08.080 --> 10:09.540
The elves,
have decided, to strike.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.910
What!

10:12.910 --> 10:14.120
You heard her!

10:14.120 --> 10:15.750
We're walking off
the job on this one, Santa.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.410
We want equal credit
for Christmas from the public.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.990
Yeah, we're the ones that
have to check the list twice
to see who's naughty or nice.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.580
Not you.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.250
And we want better
working conditions,

10:29.250 --> 10:33.120
which includes the
kids that aren't brats.

10:33.540 --> 10:37.450
- I can't control that.- Well, you need to!

10:37.450 --> 10:40.870
We've been slaving around,
making these monsters
toys for years upon years

10:42.910 --> 10:46.910
and guess who gets
all the credit? You!

10:46.910 --> 10:49.990
And we're the ones working
and you're just the face.

10:50.540 --> 10:54.370
As of now,
the elves are striking.

10:54.370 --> 10:57.910
Junior, send out
the signal, Code 33.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.990
I'm on it.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.080
This is ridiculous,
you can't do this!

11:03.080 --> 11:05.910
Watch me, Nicky.

11:05.910 --> 11:08.500
Bye, bye.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.000
Now, where was Corky working?
Atlanta! Atlanta.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.660
Atlanta. Atlanta, ah...

11:15.660 --> 11:18.830
- [kids shouting]
- [sighs]

11:18.830 --> 11:21.370
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

11:23.990 --> 11:26.500
Drake. Cacie.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.620
Sarah. Johnny.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.990
Zoe.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.790
Cedric.

11:42.580 --> 11:46.200
Welcome, my little friends.
Welcome.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.450
You have been hand-picked
by me to save Christmas.

11:49.450 --> 11:53.540
You see, my elves
went on strike today
because of kids like you,

11:54.200 --> 11:58.330
so I figured it's only fair
to recruit you to do their work.

11:59.330 --> 12:02.910
Welcome to my boot camp!

12:02.910 --> 12:04.990
- Oh, my God, you're real?
- Yeah, oh, my God.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.370
Santa, I for one always
knew that you were real.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.990
However, there has to be
some kind of mistake

12:12.990 --> 12:15.040
because I am a good kid and the
elves would not go on strike

12:15.040 --> 12:17.910
because of someone like me.

12:17.910 --> 12:19.990
Yes, Mr. Clause, sir.
I assure you that while I
only have the utmost respect

12:19.990 --> 12:23.990
for you and your
decision-making abilities,

12:23.990 --> 12:26.370
that I too have
been miscategorized.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.990
You see, I'm the kid that
lets teachers know about kids

12:28.990 --> 12:32.160
like, like him.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.290
Dude, I don't know what
you're talking about,

12:34.290 --> 12:35.830
but you better shut
your mouth, now!

12:35.830 --> 12:38.750
There are no mistakes.
You are all meant to be here.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.620
You are standing in the
middle of the training ground
for our elves.

12:43.620 --> 12:47.580
When an elf is chosen
to be one of my helpers,

12:47.580 --> 12:50.080
a very special honor by the way,

12:50.080 --> 12:52.160
he or she is brought here
to learn how to
make the toys and...

12:54.200 --> 12:56.990
...well be Santa's
little helper.

12:57.990 --> 13:00.700
Where is here?

13:00.700 --> 13:01.990
That Johnny is only
for me to know.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.120
But what about our parents?

13:06.990 --> 13:08.250
You know that they're
going to be worried

13:08.250 --> 13:10.040
and they're gonna look for us.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.620
Ho, ho, ho!
I'm not worried about that!

13:11.620 --> 13:14.990
Sir, again, if I may speak,
I'm so sure that my mother

13:14.990 --> 13:18.750
is worried sick
about me not being with her.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.990
She won't even let me use the
men's restroom at the airport.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.830
I have to go in with her.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.330
And I am certain that my
father will be on the phone

13:25.330 --> 13:27.000
with the cops looking
for me and my sister.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.080
He'll be looking for me.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.290
I'm pretty sure he'll
be glad you're gone.

13:30.290 --> 13:31.990
- I would be.
- Shut up, Sarah.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.950
- You shut up, Cacie!
- Children, enough!

13:33.950 --> 13:37.500
The point is you are here now,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.080
and it's your responsibility
to take care of the grounds

13:40.080 --> 13:42.410
and perhaps make some toys.

13:42.410 --> 13:44.200
Dude, I'm not making any toys!

13:44.200 --> 13:45.990
Yeah, I don't
even know how to.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.990
That's why you're
at my boot camp!

13:52.410 --> 13:56.040
Hello, brats,
welcome to boot camp.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.750
While you're here,
you listen to us. We own you.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.990
First, we're going
to take a quick tour.

14:03.990 --> 14:07.290
And then you'll get
started with the basics,

14:07.290 --> 14:10.500
shoveling reindeer poop.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.040
Ew.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.080
Welcome to boot camp.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.250
Here's your boots.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.540
Yup, this sucks.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.990
Wait a sec,
I was just at the mall.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.580
You, this is your fault!

14:23.580 --> 14:25.410
My fault, she's the pushy one.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.330
Oh, me, I'm the only one
that deserves to see Santa.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.410
- Really?
- Y'all are stupid.

14:30.410 --> 14:33.040
Okay, face the front. Line up.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.450
Follow us.
And march.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.990
Hup, two, three, four.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.660
Get your hands off me.

14:42.990 --> 14:45.000
Where the heck are we?

14:46.450 --> 14:49.000
We have our work
cut out for us.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.580
Look, I don't know
who you guys are,

14:51.580 --> 14:53.700
but you have some
serious explaining to do,

14:53.700 --> 14:55.990
right now, or else.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.990
- Or else what?
- Or else we'll report you.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.660
Then you're late. You've been
reported and transported.

15:00.950 --> 15:04.040
[laughing]

15:04.040 --> 15:05.790
I demand to know
what's going on here.

15:05.790 --> 15:07.370
Unfortunately, brats, you have
no position to demand anything.

15:08.990 --> 15:12.250
So come along.

15:18.790 --> 15:22.040
[computers beeping]

15:30.370 --> 15:33.790
[alarm ringing]

15:33.790 --> 15:36.870
[boy elf]
A kid just got away!

15:36.870 --> 15:38.290
Ugh, humans.

15:38.290 --> 15:39.990
That's why we don't let
humans do an elf's job.

15:41.450 --> 15:44.990
I feel so bad for Santa.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.410
I wish we could
all just get along.

15:47.410 --> 15:48.990
- [boy elf]
Yeah. What do we do?
- [boy elf 2] Let's call Skippy!

15:48.990 --> 15:52.750
[girl elf] Yeah, Skippy,
loves this sort of stuff.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.330
Yeah!

15:57.330 --> 15:58.700
[Drake]How the heck
am I gonna get out of here

16:01.540 --> 16:03.700
if I don't know where I am?

16:03.700 --> 16:06.990
How did that crazy old
man get us here anyway?

16:07.160 --> 16:10.990
Who knew Santa was a psycho?

16:10.990 --> 16:13.870
Take that back!
Santa is not a psycho!

16:13.870 --> 16:16.990
[laughs]
What are you gonna do,
little man?

16:16.990 --> 16:18.990
- Beat me up?
- You need to take that back.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.370
Dude, the old dude brought
us to some slave labor camp.

16:22.370 --> 16:25.040
- How isn't he a psycho?
- This is boot camp.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.160
Boot camps are voluntary.
This is a slave labor camp.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.870
I didn't sign up for this.

16:31.870 --> 16:33.290
[yelling]

16:33.290 --> 16:35.870
What the?
You little twerp!

16:36.990 --> 16:39.990
[chuckling]

16:39.990 --> 16:41.660
Santa's not the only one
with magic powers around here.

16:41.950 --> 16:45.200
That's impossible.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.750
Quit your moaning,
you're coming with me.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.540
I guess Santa isn't the
only one who's a psycho.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.450
[speech muffled]

16:52.450 --> 16:54.040
Don't make me tie
up your legs, too.

17:06.990 --> 17:10.160
Oh, my gosh!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.329
[chuckling]

17:13.450 --> 17:13.990
One got away.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.619
[chuckling]

17:18.619 --> 17:19.990
Kids, meet Skippy. He may
look small, but he's got skills.

17:20.290 --> 17:24.329
He was in the Elf Special
Forces on their strike team.

17:24.329 --> 17:27.290
Don't mess with Skippy.

17:27.290 --> 17:30.620
Oh, that's what I
forgot to tell you guys.

17:30.620 --> 17:33.040
Don't try anything.
We see everything.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.700
How do you think we see who's
naughty and nice in this world?

17:36.700 --> 17:39.750
If we can do that,
don't you think
we'll see if you try to escape?

17:39.750 --> 17:43.990
Who knew old St. Nick ran his
operations like Big Brother?

17:43.990 --> 17:47.000
- What was that, kid?
- What, nothing! I--

17:47.000 --> 17:48.990
He said Santa runs his
business like Big Brother.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.700
Personally, I can't imagine
how someone could accomplish
such a great feat,

17:51.700 --> 17:55.660
year after year, without
some type of surveillance.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.700
- Can it, Cedric.
- Yeah, Cedric, can it.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.990
So, listen.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.290
I've got a mani-pedi
appointment at 4:30.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.500
So if we could move this
boot camp thing along,
that'd be fantastic.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.410
Oh, my God, Sarah,
you are so self-absorbed.

18:11.410 --> 18:13.990
You know, the entire world
doesn't revolve around you
and your mani-pedis.

18:14.250 --> 18:18.450
Mr. Tiny I would like to go home
and I would like to go home now.

18:18.450 --> 18:21.990
So can we just get this going?

18:21.990 --> 18:23.410
You know, help save Christmas
and then we can go home.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.160
Elves are happy, we're happy.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.990
Alright, so your first chore
is to shovel reindeer poop.

18:28.990 --> 18:32.370
Now everybody grab a shovel.

18:32.370 --> 18:34.990
- Uh, let's not and say we did.
- Go!

18:48.500 --> 18:51.830
Not so fast.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.620
Now, grab a shovel.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.500
[laughing]

19:01.620 --> 19:05.540
- What's so funny?
- Oh, this is a joke, right?

19:05.540 --> 19:08.660
Oh, I know,
we're being punked.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.410
No.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.790
Oh, this must be a
new reality show then.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.580
No, why is this
so hard to understand?

19:13.580 --> 19:16.450
Well, look, I didn't exactly
come dressed to clean
reindeer stalls.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.990
I wanted to look nice
for my photo with Santa.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.540
Yeah, I didn't have time
to change into my black shirt

19:23.540 --> 19:26.950
before I was kidnapped.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.410
We didn't kidnap you.

19:28.410 --> 19:29.620
This is boot camp,
now get to work.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.330
Work.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.750
Hey, does anyone know
how to work this thing?

19:38.700 --> 19:39.990
Let them try it.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.750
I don't like this.

19:44.540 --> 19:47.250
They'll figure it out.
Eventually.

19:47.750 --> 19:51.290
You guys wanna
go get some chow?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.290
Yeah.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.660
It's so dirty!

19:56.500 --> 19:58.370
No, no.

19:58.370 --> 19:59.990
- Do you think they'll run?
- Oh, most definitely.

20:00.450 --> 20:04.290
That's the part about
their spirits I do like.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.990
They all seem to have
that fight in them.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.750
- Hey, don't make me!
- Make you what, Cacie?

20:15.750 --> 20:18.660
This is your fault,
you had to see Santa.

20:18.660 --> 20:21.990
How does reindeer poop have
anything to do with making toys?

20:21.990 --> 20:25.790
- I just don't get it.
- This is insane.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.200
More importantly,
how do we get out of here?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.540
I say we break
out of this place.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.200
- I'm in.
- Me too.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.040
Yeah, and I'm still ticked
about missing my appointment.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.120
I am not going to
be left alone in here.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.250
I'm in too.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.750
Well, I don't think
this is a good idea.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.500
I think we'll get caught
and then who knows
what they'll do to us.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.000
I don't care if you come
with us, but don't rat us out.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.450
I have an idea.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.750
Alright, what's
your name, elf boy?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.540
- Johnny.
- Okay, elf boy Johnny,
I'm Drake.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.910
And I'm in charge here.
So shut up and listen.

21:00.910 --> 21:03.700
Both of you shut up.
And especially you, mall elf.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.290
I saw you with that
whoopie cushion.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.910
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:07.910 --> 21:09.040
What whoopie cushion?

21:09.040 --> 21:10.580
You people are all
a bunch of losers.

21:10.580 --> 21:12.120
I don't know how I got
stuck with this group.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.830
You shut up.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.160
I never should have gone
to that dumb Santa thing.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.080
Yeah, I wish it
was New Year's.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.750
- Can everybody just be quiet?
- No, you be quiet!

21:18.750 --> 21:22.200
Who put him in charge anyways?

21:22.200 --> 21:23.990
What, would you rather be
led by a guy in an elf suit?

21:23.990 --> 21:26.990
- I don't know, maybe.
- Uh, I would rather him.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.750
Exactly, I'm leaving.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.370
I just wanna go home!

21:35.040 --> 21:38.120
Ridiculous.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.950
Okay, let's go.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.990
Guys.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.410
Alright, here's the plan.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.200
Why are we whispering?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.410
No one's around here.
No one can hear us.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.790
- Hello!
- Shut up!

22:03.790 --> 22:05.910
Okay, so we're gonna run
to the edge of the field

22:07.990 --> 22:11.540
and then look for help.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.160
Oh, that's a very
impressive plan.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.410
Thanks, I know it is.

22:14.410 --> 22:15.500
Guys, shut up and please go.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.660
I don't like this behavior.

22:17.660 --> 22:18.990
I think we should follow
the elves' orders.

22:18.990 --> 22:20.540
Shut up!

22:20.540 --> 22:21.990
Alright, go!

22:22.990 --> 22:24.660
Go, go, go!

22:41.410 --> 22:45.160
Oh, my gosh,
we're in the Twilight Zone!

22:46.000 --> 22:49.330
[screaming]

22:49.330 --> 22:51.910
Stop screaming!
It's so annoying.

22:51.910 --> 22:55.200
Finally,
we agree on something.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.830
Well, clearly you
don't know what to do

22:56.830 --> 22:58.540
or where to go fearless leader.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.290
Oh, oh and you do elf boy?

23:00.290 --> 23:02.290
Yeah, yeah I do!

23:02.290 --> 23:03.620
When we were cutting
across the field,

23:03.620 --> 23:05.500
- I saw the gates opening up.
- Uh, who'd you see?

23:05.500 --> 23:08.120
No one, but the gates
keep opening and closing.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.830
Obviously they lead somewhere.

23:10.830 --> 23:12.200
Hopefully,
somewhere far from here.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.700
Come on.

23:21.370 --> 23:24.870
What are they up to?

23:37.370 --> 23:40.870
Wait, wait, wait!

23:40.870 --> 23:43.200
I don't think rushing
in is a good idea.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.990
No kidding, it didn't seem
to work too well last time.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.910
But maybe, if we hurry, I can
still make my appointment.

23:47.910 --> 23:50.990
Enough with the
appointment already!

23:50.990 --> 23:52.990
When the elves
find out about this,
we're gonna be in big trouble.

23:52.990 --> 23:55.950
We shouldn't be doing this.
Guys come on, let's go back.

23:55.950 --> 23:58.450
Dude, can it!

23:58.450 --> 23:59.790
On three.

23:59.790 --> 24:01.250
One, two ...three!

24:03.750 --> 24:04.990
[whistle blowing]

24:10.580 --> 24:13.910
We're back.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.040
I'm pretty sure whatever
this place is, it's violating
some serious workforce laws.

24:17.580 --> 24:21.580
This has got to be some
weird nightmare or something.

24:22.450 --> 24:26.080
You guys just
don't seem to get it.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.450
So let me try to explain
this to ya one more time.

24:28.450 --> 24:32.120
You were brought here
to help with the grounds,

24:32.120 --> 24:35.000
to free up more
elves to make toys.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.750
You may be assisting them
with toy making in the future,
if needed.

24:38.790 --> 24:42.500
We can see what
you're doing, ya know!

24:42.500 --> 24:46.040
I told them not to do it,
but they wouldn't listen to me.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.160
I said it was a really bad idea,

24:48.160 --> 24:49.990
but they were being
so disrespectful.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.950
It's because of
bratty children like you
that my elves are on strike!

24:51.950 --> 24:55.830
You were brought here
to fix what you've done.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.660
Sir, again, regarding me,
I implore you to reconsider.

24:58.660 --> 25:02.250
This is a big misunderstanding.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.990
- I'm a good child, not a brat.
- Can it, Cedric!

25:04.580 --> 25:08.120
Look, you're all
here on purpose.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.540
There are no accidents.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.660
You are here to clean up
the mess that you created.

25:13.450 --> 25:16.830
Get to work.

25:16.830 --> 25:18.540
And we always
have our eyes on you.

25:21.830 --> 25:24.080
Back to the stalls, kids.
There's more poop to scoop.

25:41.370 --> 25:44.750
Diva, ma'am.

25:44.750 --> 25:45.910
Um... I was thinking that

25:45.910 --> 25:47.790
in order to promote
the good will

25:47.790 --> 25:49.120
of elves worldwide,
and reach more people,

25:49.120 --> 25:51.790
we should include Jewish
kids in the holiday.

25:51.790 --> 25:54.500
You know, figure out how
to combine Hanukkah more

25:54.500 --> 25:56.990
into Christmas and
Mr. Claus more out of it.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.990
You're telling me
you're changing your name

25:59.990 --> 26:01.580
from Murray to Hanukkah Elf?

26:01.580 --> 26:03.370
If that's what you
think would be best.

26:03.370 --> 26:05.250
Sure, I'll do it!

26:05.250 --> 26:06.790
I'll be the face of Christmas

26:06.790 --> 26:07.990
for all the Jewish kids
around the globe.

26:07.990 --> 26:09.990
I'm not sure how
that's going to work.

26:09.990 --> 26:11.580
Christmas is a
Christian holiday.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.620
That's a great idea Murray,
I mean Hanukkah Elf.

26:13.870 --> 26:17.580
Why should Christians
have all the fun?

26:17.580 --> 26:19.870
Logistically, ma'am,
that would be a bit difficult.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.790
Junior, we're looking
to expand our elf brand,
so why not?

26:22.990 --> 26:26.990
Well, we do need a broader
plan to present to Santa

26:26.990 --> 26:29.990
when we meet him in mediation.
This could help.

26:29.990 --> 26:33.450
I think it's a great idea.

26:33.450 --> 26:35.200
But if we're going
to make more toys,

26:35.200 --> 26:36.990
we're gonna need more elves.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.790
That's a great idea!

26:39.790 --> 26:41.000
Get marketing to run the
numbers and get back to me ASAP!

26:41.000 --> 26:44.450
I'm on it, Diva.

26:50.700 --> 26:54.750
Okay guys, how are we
gonna get out of here?

26:54.750 --> 26:57.000
Dude, there's a camera.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.450
Another one over there, too.

26:59.450 --> 27:02.580
No wonder they know
what we're doing.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.500
Yeah, I saw some
on the grounds too.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.160
Maybe if we broke them?

27:07.160 --> 27:08.750
We'd have a better
chance of runnin'.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.040
I say we try after dark.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.790
- I think we're all in.
- Guys, this better work.

27:13.790 --> 27:16.790
I'm not going along
with this, this time!

27:16.790 --> 27:18.620
You guys are going
to get caught, again,

27:18.620 --> 27:20.660
and then who knows
what they'll do to us?

27:20.660 --> 27:22.370
I don't want any
part of this okay?

27:22.370 --> 27:24.120
Dude, if you're not
with us, shut your mouth!

27:24.870 --> 27:27.990
[scoffs]

27:27.990 --> 27:29.450
Alright, it's time
for a dinner break.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.120
Make sure you wash your hands.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.990
Oh, how wonderful. Mr. Tiny,
you are such a great man... elf.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.580
Well, what my fellow associates

27:42.580 --> 27:44.000
don't seem to
understand is that--

27:44.000 --> 27:45.500
Can it, Cedric!

27:45.500 --> 27:48.370
Alright, line up.
We're going to the cafeteria.

28:05.540 --> 28:09.200
So if we can
keep his mouth shut...

28:10.160 --> 28:12.200
...we would be able to escape.

28:13.910 --> 28:15.120
I don't trust Cedric
to keep his mouth shut.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.990
Would you two
like some cookies?

28:16.990 --> 28:18.620
Oh, sure, I guess if
there's one good thing

28:18.620 --> 28:20.160
about being here is that we
don't have parents going,

28:20.160 --> 28:22.540
"Eat your spinach,
eat your broccoli."

28:22.540 --> 28:24.450
Cookies!

28:24.450 --> 28:25.950
Actually, dear,
our cookies are very nutritious

28:25.950 --> 28:28.500
and taste delicious.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.990
They have as many vitamins as
a whole serving of vegetables.

28:29.990 --> 28:34.000
Well, I was supposed to have
my mother's lasagna tonight,
and I really want it.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.990
Well, dear, this one
is flavored like lasagna.

28:37.990 --> 28:40.990
We also have a whole
turkey dinner cookie.

28:40.990 --> 28:43.990
I'll take one of each!

28:49.200 --> 28:52.580
Oh, my gosh!

28:52.580 --> 28:53.870
Guys, this is the best lasagna,

28:53.870 --> 28:56.160
lasagna cookie
that I've ever had!

28:56.160 --> 28:58.330
And what about
that turkey dinner?

28:59.540 --> 29:01.700
My mom only wishes
she could cook like this!

29:03.410 --> 29:06.450
Let me try one.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.080
Oh, ew, ew, ew.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.500
That's disgusting.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.990
I wish you would have asked

29:14.990 --> 29:16.370
before you just grabbed
it off the plate.

29:16.370 --> 29:18.450
That's a liver and onion cookie.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.160
Maybe next time, you might
want to use your manners.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.120
"Maybe next time, you might
want to use your manners."

29:24.990 --> 29:28.250
This place is lame.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.660
I cannot get
out of here fast enough.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.660
Aw, are you still whining
about your mani-pedi?

29:31.660 --> 29:35.080
How about you help
us plan something?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.250
Look, I just wanna
get out of here.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.660
So, whatever plan you two
come up with, count me in.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.870
We have a plan that
does not involve Cedric.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.000
We can't trust him.

29:47.330 --> 29:49.700
[Cacie] Well, is it
gonna get us out of here?

29:49.950 --> 29:51.990
Well, yeah.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.620
So, did anyone see the
sleigh in the reindeer barn?

29:57.290 --> 29:59.990
We saw it when we were
scooping reindeer poop.

30:01.370 --> 30:03.750
We lifted up the dusty
tarp and there it was.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.660
It was really cool,
it had these rockets attached--

30:08.910 --> 30:10.410
- Rockets?
- Rockets.

30:10.410 --> 30:12.160
Rockets? I thought his sleigh
was powered by reindeer.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.580
Oh, hey Cedric how's it goin'?

30:15.580 --> 30:19.250
Rockets? No we just have
a very vivid imagination.

30:19.790 --> 30:23.830
So but these cookies yeah,
they are great aren't they?

30:23.830 --> 30:26.910
Wait, no,
you just yacked on one.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.080
I obviously just
chose a bad one.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.000
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, children.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.200
Time to go to the dorms.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.990
As a reminder, the elves
sleep right next to your door,

30:34.990 --> 30:38.370
so no silly business.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.370
Right next to our door.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.990
[elf] Go down the path,
first door on the right.

30:48.200 --> 30:52.160
[Zoe] I know this may
sound a little bit corny,

30:52.160 --> 30:54.620
but this place does have
a little bit of magic to it.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.790
Gee, ya think?

30:57.790 --> 30:59.290
We keep on running
through a field,

30:59.290 --> 31:01.080
and then, poof,
we're back inside a building.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.290
The first time
I tried to escape,

31:04.290 --> 31:05.990
there was a little elf
who threw magic dust on me

31:05.990 --> 31:08.080
and all of a sudden,
I was wrapped up in rope,

31:08.080 --> 31:10.700
and he didn't even touch me!

31:10.700 --> 31:12.870
You know, we could get
our hands on the magic dust.

31:12.990 --> 31:16.790
The elves are sleeping
right next to us.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.990
Maybe we could go in there
and see where they hide it?

31:18.990 --> 31:21.450
Magic dust.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.370
Come on, guys, like, really?

31:23.370 --> 31:25.790
You know what? Whatever,
just get me out of here.

31:25.790 --> 31:28.620
I for one am a firm believer
in their magical abilities.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.990
However,
I do not condone stealing
any of their belongings.

31:32.990 --> 31:36.250
[chuckling]

31:36.250 --> 31:38.660
Whatever, man.

31:49.990 --> 31:53.750
This is where
you'll be sleeping.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.200
I have avoided sleeping
on the floor my entire life.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.200
And now it's come down to this.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.750
Come on Sarah, get a grip.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.160
You guys should be happy we
even have somewhere to sleep

32:02.160 --> 32:04.000
after your lame
excuse of an escape.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.500
Shut up.

32:08.990 --> 32:12.620
This is awful, just awful.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.750
Do you guys think they
have any more cookies left?

32:15.990 --> 32:17.160
Elf boy. Do you think
you can get in that room?

32:19.990 --> 32:23.250
Of course I can.
We need that stuff.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.540
I'll take a few of
them out if I have to.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.450
Wait, are you serious?

32:28.450 --> 32:29.990
Because I could get in and out
of that room without a peep.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.990
I do it all the time
with my sister's stuff.

32:31.990 --> 32:33.660
You know in her diary, she says
she has a crush on Max Falcon.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.330
Really, I would have thought
someone more like Russell--

32:36.330 --> 32:38.000
Shh. Girls, please keep it
down and stay focused.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.540
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.290
Alright, so you can
get into that room?

32:44.290 --> 32:47.200
Oh yeah, absolutely.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.410
I mean, really,
I'm the best at it.

32:48.990 --> 32:50.990
Alright, sounds like a plan.

32:52.410 --> 32:53.990
We should wait 'til
they're asleep though.

32:53.990 --> 32:56.080
Yeah.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.500
[beeping]

33:04.500 --> 33:06.330
Our production was down today.
But, that is to be expected

33:07.620 --> 33:11.450
since over half of the
elves went on strike.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.990
Well, we got our new
recruits up here workin'.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.910
How are the new recruits
doing with their new roles?

33:16.910 --> 33:20.120
Well, to be honest with you,
they're having a rough time.

33:20.870 --> 33:25.040
To be fair, it's tough
moving from groundskeeping
and stall-cleaning

33:25.950 --> 33:29.870
to working with highly sensitive
computer devices.

33:29.870 --> 33:32.660
I'm well aware. Dare I ask
how the kids are doing?

33:33.990 --> 33:37.910
They seem to have
done their jobs well,

33:37.910 --> 33:39.990
after their attempt
to escape, that is.

33:39.990 --> 33:43.290
Mmm. Do we need to worry
about that tonight?

33:43.290 --> 33:46.700
No, sir, the magic
gates are locked.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.620
If they try to get out,
it's gonna be a long night.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.990
[all laughing]

33:51.990 --> 33:54.200
Do we have any hope for better
production numbers tomorrow?

33:54.200 --> 33:57.700
Well, a little, but--

33:57.700 --> 33:59.080
But at the rate we're going,
we are way behind schedule.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.700
Can't you reason with
Diva and the strikers?

34:05.700 --> 34:09.250
Well, I'll give her
a call tomorrow
and see what can happen.

34:10.409 --> 34:14.409
I'm gonna get some rest.
Keep an eye on those kids.

34:14.409 --> 34:18.370
We need their help if Christmas
is ever going to happen.

34:18.370 --> 34:21.699
Good night, Santa.

34:21.699 --> 34:22.750
[all] Good night.

34:35.580 --> 34:38.989
Alright, you ready?

35:08.990 --> 35:12.080
Get off me.

35:59.410 --> 36:03.080
- Wow, she's good.
- Yeah, I know.

36:11.080 --> 36:15.250
Look what I got. The magic dust
and the diagram of the sleigh.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.000
- We're set.
- Yes, we're goin' home, man.

36:23.790 --> 36:27.450
Junior, where's
the data that we need

36:27.450 --> 36:29.410
for the number of
elves that we need

36:29.410 --> 36:31.000
if we are expanding Christmas
for the other religions?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Oh, let me get
Marketing in here.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.540
Diva, in order to keep
this a relaxing environment,

36:36.540 --> 36:39.990
we need to manage your stress.
So, deep breaths.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.660
[breathing deeply]

36:44.330 --> 36:45.830
Oh, I'm sorry this is
taking so long, ma'am.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.200
We certainly weren't expecting
this kind of request.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.120
I assure you, however,
that our data is accurate.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.830
My team is working
overtime on this.

36:55.830 --> 36:57.790
So, how much is it gonna cost,
Mr. Fancy Pants?

36:57.990 --> 37:01.450
Ma'am, according to our data,

37:01.450 --> 37:03.120
it will cost Santa Claus
twice as much.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.580
[chuckling]

37:06.580 --> 37:08.290
Fantastic, we can
advertise in new markets

37:08.290 --> 37:10.750
and show everyone who
really runs Christmas.

37:10.990 --> 37:14.290
All on Santa's dime!

37:14.290 --> 37:16.540
Who made up that rule?

37:16.540 --> 37:18.200
Murray, now known
as the Hanukkah elf.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.750
Ah, Murray, I love that guy.

37:21.750 --> 37:24.080
[breathes deeply]

37:24.080 --> 37:27.330
My life keeps getting
better and better.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.080
I can't seem to get the cameras
in the kids' dorm room to focus.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.990
It's really blurry.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.250
Do you think we should
call the electrician?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.790
Do you mean, Junior? He went
to the other side, remember?

37:42.160 --> 37:46.000
Knowing him, he has this
whole place hot-wired.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.830
So they can see and hear
everything we're doing.

37:49.250 --> 37:52.910
Isn't that against policy?

37:52.910 --> 37:54.250
I know there
are some big fines

37:54.250 --> 37:55.910
for violations on
that type of stuff.

37:55.910 --> 37:58.750
Do other holiday icons have
as many rules as we do?

37:58.750 --> 38:01.290
I know the Easter Bunny
has some major restrictions.

38:01.290 --> 38:04.830
We think we have it bad?

38:04.830 --> 38:06.250
The home entry rules he has
to follow are ridiculous.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.790
But, if you think about it,

38:09.790 --> 38:11.450
imagine what would happen
if the kids woke up

38:11.450 --> 38:13.790
to a giant rabbit
hopping through their house.

38:13.790 --> 38:16.160
[laughing]

38:16.160 --> 38:17.990
That would freak me out!

38:17.990 --> 38:20.200
[ringing]

38:20.200 --> 38:21.790
Uh-oh.
Santa, Diva's calling!

38:26.200 --> 38:29.370
What's the matter,
Big Daddy Claus?

38:29.370 --> 38:31.410
- Not so jolly today? - What do you want, Diva?

38:31.410 --> 38:34.990
Oh, I'm just checking in
to see how your scab elves

38:34.990 --> 38:37.830
and your recruits
are getting along.

38:37.830 --> 38:40.450
You really think those six
nit wits can save Christmas?

38:40.990 --> 38:44.500
Well, they're doing their part

38:44.500 --> 38:46.370
so that the elves who
haven't lost their minds

38:46.370 --> 38:48.580
and joined your side
can actually make the toys!

38:48.580 --> 38:51.580
You've kidnapped six kids,
St. Nick.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.330
You've gone over the top.

38:54.330 --> 38:55.990
I'm pretty sure that's
breaking some official

38:55.990 --> 38:58.040
Council of International
Holiday Personality rules.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.700
And not so saintly either.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.040
I've just about
had it with you, Diva.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.290
I'm at the end of my rope.
What's the reason for this call?

39:06.500 --> 39:10.500
I wanna add to the
list of demands, Santa.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.040
Not only do we want
to be equal as you

39:13.040 --> 39:15.370
in the eyes of the public
and better working conditions,

39:15.370 --> 39:18.580
but we also want to
deliver toys to the Jewish
and the Hindu kids.

39:18.580 --> 39:22.990
Which will require a
substantial increase
in our work force.

39:23.790 --> 39:27.830
You do realize that your
demands are unreasonable, right?

39:28.120 --> 39:31.660
How can I possibly--

39:31.660 --> 39:32.990
I don't need excuses,
your royal Clausness,

39:32.990 --> 39:35.080
I need results!

39:35.080 --> 39:36.660
[grunting]

39:38.790 --> 39:40.790
Here you go, dear.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.120
How can I be responsible for how
the public views the elves?

39:44.990 --> 39:48.450
Or, control bratty kids!

39:48.450 --> 39:50.910
Or, get other religious faiths
interested in participating

39:50.910 --> 39:54.620
in a Christian holiday?
This is ridiculous!

39:56.750 --> 39:58.990
- Oh! Have some milk.
- Thanks, hon.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.870
I need something stronger.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.200
Why don't you bring me some...
[clears throat]

40:09.200 --> 40:11.990
...chocolate milk.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.290
Good choice, Santa.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.080
[snoring]

41:12.250 --> 41:15.660
Yes, we made it!

41:15.660 --> 41:17.290
We made it out the building.

41:18.250 --> 41:20.540
We're a long way out of here.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.870
This had better work,
because I'm really tired.

41:22.870 --> 41:26.290
And if I don't get my sleep,
you do not want to be around me.

41:26.290 --> 41:29.330
[Cacie] We don't want
to be around you anyways.

41:29.330 --> 41:31.040
Guys, shh!

41:31.040 --> 41:33.290
I think I found
the way out, come on!

41:33.290 --> 41:36.290
Let's go.

41:51.830 --> 41:54.990
Come on.

41:56.290 --> 41:59.580
Are you sure it's a
good idea to go in there?

41:59.580 --> 42:02.120
I don't know guys, I don't
like the look of this place.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.990
What, you got
any other options?

42:04.990 --> 42:07.370
Hey, hey, guys, guys!

42:07.370 --> 42:08.990
There's a light on the other
side. Come on, follow me!

42:13.750 --> 42:17.910
Oh, oh, no, I'm all by myself,
I'm not going back in there.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.250
- I'm going back to--
- Hey, guys this way, let's go!

42:24.080 --> 42:27.290
Johnny, you're an idiot. This is
exactly where we started.

42:27.290 --> 42:30.990
We just went in a big circle.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.500
Guys, I knew we
should have went right.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.200
This time, follow me and hurry!

42:47.580 --> 42:50.790
Ugh!

42:50.790 --> 42:51.990
Again, some leaders you are.

42:52.910 --> 42:55.540
Come on, Zoe, let's show
the boys how it's done.

43:09.160 --> 43:12.410
Oh, no!

43:12.410 --> 43:14.450
Well, clearly your girl power
is not superior to us men.

43:15.830 --> 43:19.500
Guys, this place
has to be magical.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.700
We went in three different ways.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.950
I know, but at least we didn't
end up in another building.

43:23.950 --> 43:26.790
So, maybe it was the magic!

43:26.790 --> 43:28.990
"So, maybe it was the magic."

43:28.990 --> 43:30.540
- That's so stupid Cacie.
- Shut up, Sarah.

43:30.540 --> 43:33.830
If you haven't noticed,
there's some really weird
things going on here.

43:34.410 --> 43:37.990
Guys, I'm going it alone.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.950
If I don't come back,
it means I made it.

43:44.450 --> 43:48.330
Well, we finally
got rid of him!

43:51.750 --> 43:55.540
Well, I didn't make it,
but guess who I found?

43:55.540 --> 43:59.160
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, no, it's Mr. Blabbermouth.

43:59.160 --> 44:02.990
Yeah, but he's out here with us.
We left you behind on purpose.

44:03.250 --> 44:07.250
Yeah, man, you're just as
guilty as all of us now.

44:07.250 --> 44:10.540
You can't rat us out.

44:10.540 --> 44:11.910
Can't we just try
for Santa's sleigh?

44:11.910 --> 44:13.990
I mean, I have the diagram

44:13.990 --> 44:15.990
and it, it looks like
the reindeer are just props!

44:16.700 --> 44:20.250
They're stealing
Santa's sleigh.

44:20.250 --> 44:23.000
How are they
gonna pull that off?

44:23.000 --> 44:24.910
They're not, they're
gonna get caught like that!

44:24.990 --> 44:28.750
I mean it's worth a shot.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.540
How hard could
flying a sleigh be?

44:30.540 --> 44:32.990
Driving it is
different than flying it.

44:32.990 --> 44:34.990
Flying seems kinda hard.

44:34.990 --> 44:36.910
Well, the diagram
says that the wheel,

44:36.910 --> 44:39.620
you like, pull it
up and it goes up

44:39.620 --> 44:41.370
then you push it down
and it goes down,

44:41.370 --> 44:43.580
so it can't be that hard, right?

44:43.580 --> 44:44.950
Yeah, yeah,
it seems easy enough.

44:44.950 --> 44:47.990
All right,
let's get to the barn.

44:47.990 --> 44:50.660
Cedric, you ready?

44:50.660 --> 44:52.910
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

44:52.910 --> 44:55.200
Flying the sleigh
does not seem safe!

45:03.450 --> 45:06.990
[Sarah] There it is!

45:06.990 --> 45:08.160
You've got to be kidding me.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.990
Oh, no, oh, no this
doesn't seem safe.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.200
This would not pass
the FAA guidelines!

45:15.200 --> 45:17.500
Shut up!

45:17.500 --> 45:18.660
There's a barn door open!

45:18.660 --> 45:19.990
It's probably just the wind.

45:19.990 --> 45:21.620
- Check the kids' dorm room.
- They're in the barn!

45:21.620 --> 45:24.040
Oh, Gobstoppers,
they're in Santa's sleigh.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.160
- [alarm blaring]
- Code stray sleigh!

45:27.160 --> 45:28.830
- I repeat, code stray sleigh!
- Claus, we got a runner.

45:28.830 --> 45:31.990
Claus, we got a runner!

45:31.990 --> 45:33.750
- This looks rickety!
- Dude, shut up.

45:33.750 --> 45:36.990
I think I can hotwire it.

45:36.990 --> 45:38.000
I did it to my
dad's car one time.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.540
I'm not surprised.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.750
Oh, no, look, it's right here!

45:40.750 --> 45:42.200
[engine starts]

45:42.200 --> 45:45.540
Whoo-hoo, this is
gonna be crazy fun!

45:45.540 --> 45:48.580
What, no, we're all gonna die!

45:48.580 --> 45:50.000
I don't wanna
be on this thing!

45:50.000 --> 45:51.990
Oh, just shut up and strap in.

45:51.990 --> 45:53.910
My hair does not do
well in the open air.

45:53.910 --> 45:55.660
Guys, how are we gonna
get this thing outta here?

45:55.660 --> 45:57.990
I know!

45:57.990 --> 45:59.830
Would you stop crying?

46:04.040 --> 46:07.620
- Oh, no, oh no!
- Go!

46:08.580 --> 46:10.620
[all yelling]

46:14.330 --> 46:17.660
[yelling]

46:18.950 --> 46:20.000
What in the name of Jiminy
Christmas is going on here?

46:23.750 --> 46:27.700
What do you think you're doing?
You could be killed!

46:28.990 --> 46:31.450
The sleigh cannot fly,
but on Christmas Eve.

46:33.120 --> 46:36.620
That's the rules!

46:36.620 --> 46:38.250
I have had enough of you brats.

46:38.250 --> 46:40.950
You're the reason that I'm in
this mess in the first place.

46:40.950 --> 46:43.910
Little snot-nosed kids like you,

46:43.910 --> 46:46.290
always picking on my
hard working elves.

46:46.290 --> 46:49.200
No wonder they don't
wanna go to work anymore.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.540
Don't you get it?

46:54.580 --> 46:56.040
Christmas cannot happen
unless you get back to work.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.990
I gave you a pretty
easy task yesterday,

47:01.990 --> 47:05.450
but today,
we'll step it up a notch

47:05.450 --> 47:08.990
since you don't
want to cooperate.

47:08.990 --> 47:11.700
Tiny? Get them set up
to watch the videos!

47:11.990 --> 47:16.000
- Yes, sir.
- Get them started
on it right away,

47:16.000 --> 47:19.910
since it appears
that they're not too tired.

47:22.410 --> 47:23.950
Come on, you hooligans. Get out!
Get in a line and march!

47:27.500 --> 47:31.000
We're going to watch the videos.

47:31.790 --> 47:33.990
A little bit faster!

47:49.620 --> 47:53.120
Sit right there and don't move.

47:53.410 --> 47:56.750
Come on in.

47:56.750 --> 47:58.120
I'll go to the front, excuse me.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.500
Stupid humans,
always getting into trouble.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.660
This is where we watch
clips of kids' lives

48:06.990 --> 48:09.040
to determine if they're
naughty or nice.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.500
- Dude, this could be fun.
- Alright, sure, dude.

48:11.990 --> 48:15.990
You think this will be fun,
but pay attention.

48:16.950 --> 48:20.370
Because by the 100th kid,

48:20.370 --> 48:22.120
they'll all start
to run together.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.540
All you have to do is press
the red button for naughty,

48:25.990 --> 48:29.620
and the green button for nice.

48:29.620 --> 48:32.160
Got it?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.790
- Yeah, got it,
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

48:33.790 --> 48:36.450
And I'll be
staying with y'all.

48:36.450 --> 48:37.990
So no sleeping on the job.

48:37.990 --> 48:40.370
I'm not stickin'
around here, have fun.

48:53.040 --> 48:57.080
Anna's spying on me again.
I have to go.

48:57.080 --> 49:00.990
I wouldn't want to spy
on your stupid phone
conversations anyway.

49:00.990 --> 49:04.700
"He's totally hot, like,
oh, my God, whatever."

49:04.700 --> 49:07.290
[Sadie]Shut up!

49:07.290 --> 49:09.000
You don't wanna hear
what I heard about your
boyfriend today?

49:09.000 --> 49:12.790
Dude, you didn't hear
anything about Jason.

49:12.790 --> 49:14.950
You don't even know him.

49:14.950 --> 49:16.910
Okay, I'll just go.

49:17.370 --> 49:20.040
Wait, tell me.

49:22.790 --> 49:22.990
Alright.

49:25.990 --> 49:27.870
He was kissing Julie Sampson

49:28.830 --> 49:31.120
by the courtyard
outside of the school.

49:32.410 --> 49:34.540
What?
Oh, my God, he is such a jerk!

49:38.700 --> 49:41.450
I knew it.

49:41.990 --> 49:43.620
Oh, my God,
who does he think he is?

49:56.790 --> 49:59.990
[beeping]

49:59.990 --> 50:02.000
I didn't ask you to
do my project for me.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.330
No, you blackmailed me!

50:04.330 --> 50:06.450
[chuckles] Yeah, a guy'sgotta do what a guy's gotta do.

50:06.450 --> 50:09.950
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, I was just--

50:09.950 --> 50:12.500
Turn around
and do your homework.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.620
I'm so nervous I could puke.

50:14.620 --> 50:16.620
You're going to
be fine, I promise.

50:16.620 --> 50:19.990
No, you won't,
you suck at everything.

50:19.990 --> 50:22.990
Whoa.

50:22.990 --> 50:24.620
- Thanks.
- No problem, are you new?

50:26.500 --> 50:29.830
Uh, yeah today's my first day.

50:30.750 --> 50:32.700
Goodie-two-shoes.

50:33.990 --> 50:35.950
- Can I look off your test?
- What?

50:37.830 --> 50:39.990
Itching powder?

50:39.990 --> 50:41.000
I found this underneath my bed.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.910
All I wanted
was you out of my room!

50:42.910 --> 50:45.120
Oh, nice!

50:45.120 --> 50:47.410
- Shut up or I'll tell mom!
- Tell her what?

50:48.790 --> 50:52.620
Hey, punk,
where's my cigarettes?

50:52.870 --> 50:56.200
What a horrible person.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.580
So why are you
inviting her to your party?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.990
I don't know,
maybe I should uninvite her.

51:01.990 --> 51:04.990
[laughing]

51:04.990 --> 51:06.200
You do realize
you're not going to last

51:06.200 --> 51:08.450
one day in this school, right?

51:16.540 --> 51:19.950
[bell ringing]

51:19.950 --> 51:21.790
So how do you think
you did on the math test?

51:21.790 --> 51:23.500
I don't think
I did very well.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.200
Really, I though
it was really easy.

51:25.200 --> 51:26.370
Hey, guys,
look who we got here,

51:26.370 --> 51:28.200
a couple of dorks.

51:28.580 --> 51:30.330
Just leave us alone, Drake.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.910
Oh, or what,
you gonna tell mommy?

51:33.910 --> 51:37.330
Guys, I'm feelin'
a little hungry.

51:37.330 --> 51:39.750
- Really? Yeah, me too.
- You got any change?

51:39.990 --> 51:43.500
I only have enough for myself.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.290
Nah, nah, that's perfect.
Give it up.

51:45.290 --> 51:48.580
You think you're so cool,
Drake, but you're not.

51:50.700 --> 51:52.990
Give me the change.

51:53.990 --> 51:56.830
Some day, Drake,
you're gonna be sorry.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.200
[guys chuckling]

52:01.910 --> 52:02.830
Guys, I'm gonna be sorry!

52:02.830 --> 52:04.790
[boy] You better
watch your back, man!

52:10.540 --> 52:13.990
I know, red button.

52:38.790 --> 52:41.990
Hmm...

53:05.870 --> 53:09.870
- Hey, Zo, how are you?
- Hello, mother, I'm good.

53:09.870 --> 53:12.290
Good.

53:12.450 --> 53:13.750
[groans]

53:15.700 --> 53:18.250
Eric, come out!
You have some explaining to do!

53:19.870 --> 53:22.370
What explaining
do I have to do?

53:23.410 --> 53:24.990
Did you eat the
pie in the fridge?

53:24.990 --> 53:26.540
- No.
- Yes you did, I saw you!

53:26.540 --> 53:30.200
- Mom, she's lying!
- Then what is this?

53:30.200 --> 53:34.250
- I mean, whipped cream, but--
- Busted, you know it.

53:34.250 --> 53:37.250
- Grounded, get in your room.
- Mom.

53:45.990 --> 53:49.990
What? It was a mistake,
I did not see the note, okay?

53:51.750 --> 53:55.990
You blamed your brother.
Speaking from experience,
that's not fair.

53:58.870 --> 54:00.950
Yeah, I know.

54:17.330 --> 54:21.250
I'll be right back.
You guys keep it down, okay?

54:29.950 --> 54:33.040
Hey, loser.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.450
That's not very nice, Johnny.

54:35.450 --> 54:37.500
I call it like I see it.

54:38.910 --> 54:39.790
So do you have any friends?

54:42.330 --> 54:44.950
Yeah, I have
friends of course I do.

54:45.790 --> 54:49.500
I'll tell you what.
I'll be your friend if you
just let me get a look.

54:49.990 --> 54:53.450
Let you see the test, no.

54:59.950 --> 55:02.990
[spits]

55:02.990 --> 55:05.290
[chuckles]
Direct hit.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.290
[sighs]

55:14.990 --> 55:18.080
[grunts]

55:18.080 --> 55:19.500
[all laughing]

55:19.500 --> 55:22.000
What is going on in here?

55:23.000 --> 55:24.950
He was looking at
my paper and he fell.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.580
Johnny, that was Eugene.
What did he do to you?

55:31.000 --> 55:34.620
- Nothing!
- You were a jerk!

55:35.500 --> 55:37.370
Yeah, yeah, I was.

55:52.950 --> 55:56.040
[humming]

56:03.040 --> 56:06.620
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

56:06.620 --> 56:08.950
It looks like you've
mistakenly assumed

56:08.950 --> 56:10.990
that Michael, here,
is interested in

56:10.990 --> 56:12.950
anything you have to say.

56:12.950 --> 56:15.250
I don't think
it's a mistake, Sarah.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.700
Whoa, girls, girls.
Please don't be silly we can--

56:17.700 --> 56:21.660
Michael, can I talk to
Jennifer alone for a minute?

56:21.990 --> 56:25.290
- Alone?
- Yeah.

56:25.290 --> 56:27.990
- Are you sure?
- Just, just give us a minute.

56:27.990 --> 56:30.620
Okay, okay.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.120
- See ya.
- Bye.

56:35.410 --> 56:38.990
Perhaps you don't understand

56:38.990 --> 56:40.620
that when a man is
dating another woman,

56:40.620 --> 56:42.830
you leave him alone.

56:42.830 --> 56:44.990
Even a ditz like you
should understand that.

56:44.990 --> 56:48.120
Oh, yeah, what are
you gonna do about it?

56:50.950 --> 56:51.990
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do about it.

57:01.370 --> 57:04.870
That should work.

57:10.540 --> 57:13.990
Not my finest moment.

57:14.990 --> 57:15.990
You're a cyber bully?

57:20.580 --> 57:23.990
Yeah, I guess I am.

57:25.410 --> 57:26.990
Sorry.

57:35.990 --> 57:40.120
I am better than every
other girl in this room.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.990
I don't understand why
I didn't get the lead.

57:42.990 --> 57:45.290
Because Brianna has
been very strong lately
and she deserves it.

57:45.290 --> 57:48.990
Brianna doesn't
deserve anything!

57:48.990 --> 57:50.540
Enough, now go and warm up

57:50.540 --> 57:52.830
before I take you out
of the show completely.

57:52.830 --> 57:55.450
Ladies!
Places, please, let us rehearse.

57:55.620 --> 57:58.950
Come, come!

58:00.290 --> 58:03.620
[chuckling]

58:03.620 --> 58:04.990
Places and,
five, six, seven, eight.

58:05.910 --> 58:09.250
One, two, three, four,

58:09.250 --> 58:11.830
five and six and seven, eight.

58:11.830 --> 58:13.910
And one, two, three, four,
five and six and seven.

58:14.660 --> 58:17.990
[screaming]

58:17.990 --> 58:19.330
Oh, my gosh,
I stepped on a tack!

58:19.330 --> 58:21.660
Why is there a
tack in the studio?

58:21.660 --> 58:23.990
Who put it here?

58:23.990 --> 58:25.990
Cacie, you put it here,
didn't you!

58:25.990 --> 58:28.580
Why would I put a
tack in the studio?

58:28.580 --> 58:31.290
Come, Brianna darling,
let's go and get you cleaned up.

58:31.290 --> 58:34.330
Here we go.

58:34.330 --> 58:35.870
Why would you
do that to me, Cacie?

58:43.330 --> 58:46.990
Wow, I thought mine was bad.

58:49.620 --> 58:50.500
Yeah, that's
really embarrassing.

59:06.540 --> 59:09.990
[girl] Can I trust you?

59:09.990 --> 59:11.080
Of course you can,
we're friends.

59:11.370 --> 59:15.370
Well, you know how I always
make straight A's, right?

59:15.370 --> 59:18.500
Yes, that's why we're friends
because we both excel in school.

59:18.700 --> 59:22.500
I've been cheating
in Chemistry this year.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.700
- Cheating?
- I feel horrible.

59:25.120 --> 59:28.870
But I just don't understand it.

59:28.870 --> 59:31.000
But how could you cheat?

59:31.000 --> 59:32.660
I mean, even if I didn't
know the material,

59:32.660 --> 59:34.330
I wouldn't cheat.

59:34.330 --> 59:36.200
That's so disgusting.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.750
I shouldn't have told you.

59:37.750 --> 59:39.870
What, wait hold on.

59:39.870 --> 59:41.990
I can't believe you!

59:41.990 --> 59:44.540
- What happened?
- She's probably
going home to study.

59:44.540 --> 59:47.620
Study, wow, on a Saturday.

59:47.620 --> 59:50.700
Tandy's mom told me she
never gets less than A's.

59:51.080 --> 59:54.830
It's amazing, what a smart girl.

59:54.830 --> 59:56.910
Oh, she's not that smart.

59:56.910 --> 59:58.330
She's been cheating
on her Chemistry tests.

59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.160
I bet her mother would
love to hear about this.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.160
Dude, you ratted out
your best friend. Not cool.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.990
She always acts like
she's better than me.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.870
Clearly she isn't.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.410
Cedric, she confided in you.

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.870
You posted a pic of someone
to embarrass them, that's bad.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.370
Telling the truth isn't bad.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.410
Well, what about gossiping
to make yourself sound better?

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.910
It wasn't gossiping!

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.910
Alright, that's
enough for tonight.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.660
You guys go get rested up.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.120
We have more work to
do in a few hours.

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:50.910
I cannot believe what
an awful sister I was.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.990
I was so insecure.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:58.700
I can't believe
I acted like that.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.990
Yeah, I wouldn't put
either of you on the nice list.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.290
Whatever, Johnny. You were
being just as bad bullying.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.990
Yeah, I know.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.200
No wonder our parents
aren't looking for us.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.990
Dude, I don't even
blame my parents.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.990
I'm just a pain in
the butt to them.

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:20.990
You know, those videos made
me look like a complete jerk.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
You know, man,
I don't think so.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.080
I mean, those videos were
us at our worst moment.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.990
I just think we couldn't
have almost escaped

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.080
if it wasn't for you.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.500
Yeah, almost.
But we didn't.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.990
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.870
but I think you did a great job.

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:48.370
You had better ideas
than any of us.

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.990
And you had enough guts
to try and fly the sleigh.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.500
Out of my way you scoundrels!

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.990
[Cedric]
This is completely unfair.
I don't belong here.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.990
And these stupid kids with me.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.410
Who do they think they are?

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.120
Trying to keep me out of
their secret escape plans.

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:39.450
I'll show them an escape plan.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:48.620
[groans]

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.410
Alright! Today's gotta be
a better day, huh?

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:56.370
I can't take much more of this.

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.290
All of the elves are
ready to start, sir.

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.370
They're just waking up now.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.950
Hello, Claus Almighty.
Top of the mornin' to ya.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:07.500
Ah, Diva, you were on
my list to call today.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.200
You've been thinking about me?

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.750
- Aw, isn't that sweet.- [grunts]

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.160
My marketing group
has estimated about
10,000 additional elves

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.580
to help with the toy production

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.990
for the Jewish
and the Hindu kids.

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.990
Diva, let's be rational here.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:29.160
How can I get non-Christian kids

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.080
to buy into a Christian
holiday tradition?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.990
I'll tell you what,
I'm feeling generous today.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:38.000
I'll cut you a break.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.870
You won't have to worry
about that until next year,

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.990
but this will be
in our agreement.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.990
Your demands are ludicrous,
all of them.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.250
You want me to change
your public image,
get naughty kids to behave

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:54.250
and convince other religions
to buy into the idea
of me and Christmas.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.660
I'm Santa, not God!

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.990
So we're clear, I want you
to get the other religions

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:05.580
to buy into the Elf Christmas.

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.830
Not the Santa Christmas.

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.910
- Ludicrous!
- It is!

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.620
Figure it out fuzz-face.

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:14.700
There's no Christmas
without us.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.370
Your scab elves
can't get the job done.

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.990
You're running out of time.

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.450
Who does she think she is?

01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:24.540
[groans] She's right,
we're running out of time.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.990
But there's no way
that I can get kids

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.910
to behave or their parents
to respect the elves.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:35.580
This is just not possible.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.790
Santa, you can't give up.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.500
Christmas has to happen.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.540
There's gotta be a way.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.700
Well, let's see how it
goes today with production.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.370
I'll make sure that
all the elves know
it's crunch-time, sir.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.830
I'll get all
the elves started.

01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:55.990
I love you guys.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.700
Wake up, wake up.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.990
Hey, hey, hey, stop squirming.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.790
If you don't stop squirming,
I'm gonna use this.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:02.410
You don't know how to use it.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:04.200
Exactly, that makes it
all the more dangerous.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.990
Now, you're gonna start talking.

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.990
About what?

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.160
Where are we and how
do we get out of here?

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.620
I don't know, I'm just an elf.
I make toys!

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.790
You have to know!

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.660
You have to know.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.120
You come here to make toys
and then after Christmas

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.450
you go home to your,
to your little elf village
or wherever you people live.

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.990
- Who you callin' people?
- Where are we?

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:31.830
- Cedric, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to get us home!

01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:35.990
But unlike you guys,
I'm actually going to succeed.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.500
Now, come on!

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.990
Where are we and how
do we get out of here?

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:43.620
It depends on
where you wanna go.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.700
Home, I want to go home!

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.910
- Dude, chill.
- If someone else
tells me to chill,

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.990
I'm gonna chill on you!

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:53.620
Now, this little elf is gonna
tell us how to get home.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.660
Come on!

01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.620
Move.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.080
Santa, I know you can hear me.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.500
You can see me when I'm sleepin'
so this shouldn't
be too hard for you.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.500
We are tired of being here.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.990
We are tired of
being your slaves!

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:14.450
And I got your little
demon elf here, too.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:17.200
Move.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.700
Move!

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.370
I know you can hear me, Santa!

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.040
Now, son, you don't really
want to do that.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.620
Elves don't do
well in your world.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.990
They have to be
specially trained.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.160
Cedric, are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.750
It's too late for that!

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.200
Can it, Drake!

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.870
Send us home,
or the elf comes with us.

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.450
You know what?

01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:45.120
This isn't worth it,
none of this is!

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.990
Officially,
Christmas is canceled!

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:51.750
[gasping]

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.410
Half my staff is gone.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.990
My loyal elves are
workin' their tails off.

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:58.120
We constantly have to
monitor these bozos

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.620
and we're still not
gettin' the job done.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.200
I'm tired. I've had it.
I quit!

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.990
Cancel Christmas?
What, how can this be?

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:12.330
But, Santa,
what will we do for work?

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:16.330
It's always been my dream
to make toys for you.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:18.990
I've let my family down.

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:20.790
My family will be so
disappointed about this news.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:24.290
- Mine too!
- I'll probably be disowned!

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:27.990
They'll all be
disappointed in us.

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:30.080
Think about all the kids!

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.330
They can't cancel Christmas.

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.250
I've done everything
that I can do.

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.660
I'm going on vacation.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.000
Maybe, Waikiki.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.990
Mrs. Claus has
always wanted to go,

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:46.200
it's about time
she got a nice present.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.700
Now, you kids, you take
a little bit of that dust,

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.620
toss it in the air,
over year heads

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.450
and think about the
mall where you were

01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:57.370
and you'll be back
there right away.

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:00.290
To my loyal, wonderful elves,

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.290
Make sure you ring
Diva and tell her

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:08.990
there is no more
Christmas this year.

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.990
So, her position and those
of the striking elves
no longer needed.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.990
Uh... and you can go home
to your families

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.040
and enjoy your extra time off.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.950
Maybe we can get this
all straightened out
before next year.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.540
Wow, I feel better already!

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:36.080
Ho, ho, ho!

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.200
I just have one more thing
to say to all of you.

01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:49.080
Aloha!

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.660
Now you see what you've done?

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.040
What did I do?

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.700
There has to be
a way to fix this.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.580
Guys, let's just go home.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.330
This isn't our problem.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:28.830
How is this not our problem?

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:30.990
We were the ones that were
supposed to save Christmas.

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:33.950
Guys, why don't we talk
to the striking elves?

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.450
If there's any time
to leave, it's now.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:49.290
I need to talk to Santa.

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.080
I can't be the reason why
Christmas is canceled.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.080
This can't be on me.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.540
Come on, guys! If anyone
can save Christmas, it's us.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.450
Who's in?

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:06.990
- I'm in.
- Okay.

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:08.700
I'm in.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.990
All right,
let's go talk to the elves.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.990
[Johnny] Tiny, Tiny, Tiny!
We need your help!

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:26.370
Why should I help you?

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.040
You're the reason
all this happened.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.870
Well, we came here to fix it.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.950
Half the elves are
striking because of you.

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:35.950
And the other half
are on their way home

01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:37.870
because Christmas is canceled.
Because of you!

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:41.500
Give me one good reason.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:48.000
I have an idea.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.660
Well, actually
it's, it's Zoe's idea.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.250
We were just wondering
if we could talk
to the striking elves.

01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:55.990
Yeah, we thought that we
could convince these to stay

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:57.950
and maybe convince the
other ones to come back.

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.990
I'll talk to Santa,
I'll make it right.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.700
Well, it might work.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.790
No, it had better work.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.410
It will, it will.

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:17.500
Talk to the elves.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.410
Hi, I'm Drake, and...

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.080
...my friends and I,
we'd like to say

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.750
we're really sorry
for what we've done.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.120
- I'll say!
- Santa was jolly.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.080
Did you see his
face when he quit?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.830
Those weren't rosy cheeks.

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah, I know, and we
feel really bad about that.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.990
You should!

01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:40.120
Because of you,
none of the children

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.750
are going to have a
Christmas this year.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:43.660
- Where are we supposed to go?
- What are we supposed to do?

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:47.160
I know, we're trying
to make it right.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.200
Make it right?
It's a little too late for that.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.830
Please, listen,
we've got an idea.

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:57.410
I want to talk to
the striking elves.

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.410
I think I can convince
them to come back.

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.990
All I'm asking is for you guys
to keep doing what you're doing.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:07.120
If we keep making presents,
Santa will come back.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.000
He never promised that!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.330
He's Santa, of course
he'll come back.

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:13.120
Yeah.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.410
Alright, let's go back to work.

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:22.330
- Are you ready?
- I guess so.

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:26.000
Good luck.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.990
Thanks.

01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:38.870
What is it?

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.250
Oh, who do we have here?

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:46.160
Zoe, is it?

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.990
Wait a minute,
how do you know my name?

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:51.200
Oh, you haven't figured out
we've been watching you, too?

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:54.700
Well, then I guess you
know that Santa's quit.

01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.500
Santa quit?

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.160
Junior, why did I
not know Santa quit?

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.370
He just quit.

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.080
He got all upset that
we tried to kidnap...

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.120
...you know what, actually no,

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.500
Cedric tried to kidnap
one of his elves.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.950
And I've never seen
anything like it.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:13.620
What about Christmas?

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.290
He said he's canceling
Christmas and going to Waikiki.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:18.990
But he can't cancel Christmas.

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:21.450
Christmas has to happen!

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.990
Well, no he didn't
seem to think so.

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:26.040
I mean, he was really upset.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.160
I just heard the news.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.540
You realize this means
that our union has nothing,

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.500
no leg to stand on?

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.700
Do you realize you're
telling the enemy that?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.910
What? We're not your enemy.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.540
In fact, that's exactly
why I'm calling.

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.990
You see, we came to ask,

01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:45.990
no, actually beg you to come
back and help us make the toys.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:49.950
You like being an elf, right?

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:51.790
You like making
all of these toys.

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:54.040
You like making sure
all the little boys

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.080
and girls all over
the world are happy

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.990
because Santa's little helpers
are making toys for them.

01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:01.250
Right?

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:02.750
Wait boys and girls
think we make the toys?

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:08.290
Of course! Santa, well,
he's just the delivery system.

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.990
Everyone knows that
the elves do all the work.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.160
Really? We thought they gave
credit to Santa.

01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:21.990
No, we know that
Santa is just the one
who relays the messages.

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:26.500
And we only ask him because
he's the one who keeps the list.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.990
- Wow, that changes everything.- Wow.

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:34.700
So, will you come back?
Will you help us?

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.120
We really need you.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.990
I'll go check with
the other elves.

01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:41.040
I'm pretty sure I can get
the other elves to come.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.120
I mean, after all, Christmas
cannot be canceled.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.700
Not on my watch.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.950
[both] Yes.

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.370
Hurry back, we're
already behind schedule.

01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:54.830
We will, we will.

01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:57.410
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:59.290
I'm shocked.
I didn't think you could do it.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.830
Well, I guess, being nice
and saying what you mean
goes a long way.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.290
You know what,
I guess it does.

01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:19.700
[bell ringing]

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.700
I'm back everyone!

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.870
So, you came back, did you?

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.990
I'm back, Twink.

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:28.950
I don't think you should
have ever left, Diva.

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:31.200
I had to make a
point for us elves.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.330
But the things you were
asking for, Santa can't help.

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.500
I appreciate last year's push
to get vision and dental

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.700
added to our insurance plan,

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.950
but this year's demands
were over the top.

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:44.330
You aren't on the front-lines!

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:45.990
Oh, I've been on
the front-lines, Diva!

01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:48.620
I meant with the kids.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.910
You haven't been sneezed,
coughed on, poked, kicked.

01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:52.990
You haven't had the disrespect
all the other elves have had.

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:56.750
This is not an easy job, Diva.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.580
All the elves that are
Santa's little helpers

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.330
are the best of the best.

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:03.370
They know what they're
signing up for,

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.000
and that comes
with the territory.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.160
I wanted to make a difference.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:11.040
You do make a difference.

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.990
You make a difference when
you convince the elves

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:15.990
to make toys and do their best.

01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:19.080
You make a difference
when you support Santa
and get the job done.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.990
You make a huge difference.
You're a leader.

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:28.200
Thanks, Twink.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.910
[train whistle blowing]

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:39.120
[rock version
of "Deck the Halls" plays]

01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.700
Alright, everyone.
It's time for a break.

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:08.830
I don't know how long
I can keep up this pace.

01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:11.450
I know,
it's like double-speed.

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:14.080
How are we going
to get this done?

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.290
I don't think we can.

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:19.000
Guys, what if they're right?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.080
Yeah, this is like
light-speed fast.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.580
What if we got
some of our friends?

01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:29.990
Yeah, but how will
we get 'em here?

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:32.500
Same way we got you guys here.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.000
How exactly was that?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.370
I'll show you, come on.

01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:45.200
Okay, type your friends'
names in and let me know
when you're done.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.580
- Alright, I'm done.
- Okay.

01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:52.990
I could really go for
something to drink right now.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.000
Where are we?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.120
Drake?

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.580
- Dude, what's goin' on?
- Dude, this is so cool.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.580
Hey, you look different.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.990
Yeah, man, you look... nice.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.000
Alright, look.

01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:17.910
Santa canceled Christmas,

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:19.200
and right now we're
at Santa's boot camp.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.580
I need you guys to help
me build all the toys

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.990
for all the little girls
and little boys
all across the world.

01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:26.830
[laughing]

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:31.950
Dude, you've seriously
lost it, my man.

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:34.660
Yeah, dude, you've gone crazy.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.990
No, I'm serious.
I need you guys' help.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:39.250
- And so do the elves.
- Alright, the elves!

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:42.660
- The elves need our help!
- The elves need our help.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.080
Yeah, we got you!

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.450
I'm an elf.
And we need your help.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.620
- Yeah, man, okay.
- Let's go, come on.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.750
- Let's go.
- Alright, follow me.

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.000
- Alright, yeah sure.
- Let's go.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.870
- Alright, Johnny.
- Who would you like to bring?

01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:03.580
I know someone
who needs a friend.

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:15.990
This is what I'm talkin' about.

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:21.950
- Hey, Cedric.
- Hey, Eugene.

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:25.330
Hey, aren't you the
one who tells on us?

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.500
Hey, yeah, you are!

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.990
I used to be,
things have changed.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.410
We don't have time
for that right now.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.830
We gotta make toys.

01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:33.990
Come on, guys.

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:40.990
This is my favorite,
this is where we make the toys.

01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:44.910
- I love it!
- Wow.

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:47.500
Well, come on,
I've got more to show you!

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.540
Alright, alright.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:06.000
Good job, guys!
We're finished!

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.750
The warehouse is full of toys!

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:11.990
We did it!
Oh, my gosh, it's over.

01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:15.040
We made all those toys
for the little boys

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.790
and girls all over the world.

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:18.580
It's not over yet.
We have one more thing to do.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.990
We'll come with you. We were
all pretty horrible to him.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.660
Yeah, I need to go, too.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.290
This is about cooperation and
creating for the greater good.

01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:31.250
Alright, let's go ring
him up on the video phone.

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:35.200
[holiday rock music]

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:42.580
Tiny, give me your phone.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.000
Code 99, guys!
We're callin' Santa!

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:48.950
Come on, elves.

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:50.160
Well, look who it is.

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.790
Hey, hon, it's Diva!

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:55.500
Hold that thing steady now.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.990
Well, Diva, did you get
the kids to come over

01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:02.120
to your side now, too?

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.080
- No, Santa I--
- Santa, I'm really sorry,
I lost it!

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:08.580
I don't want you
to cancel Christmas.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.660
You can't cancel Christmas.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.580
Johnny thought we could do
something, so he called Tiny,

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.990
Drake convinced all
the elves to stay,

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:16.830
then Zoe called Diva and she
brought all the elves back.

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:19.700
Cacie and I have been
working really hard

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.040
to get all the
toys ready, Santa.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.750
You've been making toys?

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:25.330
We all have.

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:26.990
They're all made, sir.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:28.290
Now we just need you.

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.950
Will you come back and help
us deliver all the toys?

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:32.370
They're all made?
The toys are ready?

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:35.370
Yes, sir!
With help from the extra kids,
we're ready for Christmas!

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:40.580
I'm amazed!
I'm dumbfounded!

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:43.990
I'm flabbergasted!
I don't know what to say!

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:48.990
Well, say you'll come back
and deliver all the toys!

01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:51.700
[bells ringing]

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.290
[all] Whoa!

01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:55.910
Well, you've shown so much
heart, how could I refuse?

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.830
[cheering]

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:02.370
There's still work to do!

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:06.080
Go, go get the sleigh
and the reindeer ready!

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.290
Santa, I'm sorry.

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.120
We're all really sorry.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.540
Yeah, after
watching those videos,

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.910
we realized we were all bad.

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:22.160
Yeah, especially me.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.830
We were all on
the naughty list.

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:27.200
We're all just so
happy that you came back.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.990
Well, you should be
very proud of yourselves.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:35.120
Not only did you save Christmas,

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.790
but you brought all
my elves together, too!

01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:41.540
That's something
I wasn't able to do.

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.540
You've shown what was in your
hearts and you worked together

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:48.870
to make it happen.

01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:51.080
That's some true
Christmas spirit.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.200
Oh, well, now it's time
for you guys to get home!

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:58.160
Wait, we have a gift for you.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.290
- For me?
- Yep.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:07.990
To show you that
bad kids can be nice.

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:11.870
Oh, thanks, guys.

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:14.910
[all laughing]

01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:30.000
I saw this and well,
I thought of you.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.910
Aw, I made you something, too!

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:35.410
Hey, I got you something.

01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:37.540
Man, I got you something, too.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.990
A magic set, that's awesome!

01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:42.750
Legwarmers, thank you so much!

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.870
Oh? A book!

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.990
A mani-pedi gift certificate?

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:52.000
You are the best sister ever.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.370
Oh, my gosh,
it's so much smaller!

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:58.540
- A bow tie!
- [Drake] Yes.

01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:01.750
- You know I like spiffy ties!
- I know, I know!

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:04.200
It's to add to your collection.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:06.990
Kids, I thank you.

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:12.910
No, really.
You've been great.

01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.410
This Christmas couldn't
have happened without you.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:18.250
But now, I am bootin'
you out of boot camp.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.950
In other words,
I'm sendin' you back.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.910
Merry Christmas!

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:28.330
Hasta la vista, kiddos!

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.370
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!

01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:35.700
- We have a gift for you.
- To show you that
bad kids can be nice.

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.700
- I'm sorry.
- We're all really sorry.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.830
We were all on
the naughty list.

01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:42.990
Look who we've got here,
a couple of dorks.

01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:45.200
He was looking at
my paper and he fell!

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.160
Yes you did, I saw you!

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.990
I am better than
every other girl.

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:50.990
She's not that smart,

01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:52.410
she's been cheating
on her chemistry test.

01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:53.750
You people are all
a bunch of losers.

01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:55.160
I don't know how I got
stuck with this group.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.540
I've got a mani-pedi
appointment at 4:30,

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.290
so, if we could move this
boot camp thing along.

01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:00.910
I'm a good child, not a brat!

01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:02.450
You know I got all the brains

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:03.870
and athletic ability
in this family.

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:05.120
Newsflash, kiddos,
Santa isn't real!

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.080
- I'm sorry.
- We're all really sorry.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.290
We were all on
the naughty list.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.990
To show you that
bad kids can be nice.

01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:23.700
[muted dialogue]

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:35.790
So, what do you
want for Christmas?

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.290
[chuckles]

01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:41.990
Ho, ho, ho!

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.990
Just try to get along
and be helpful to all.

01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:06.330
Being bratty and self-centered
just makes you small.

01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:10.990
No matter if you believe
in Santa or his elves,

01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:14.290
The important thing is
to believe in yourselves.

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:23.870
[soft rock music]

01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:30.040
Hello, there, Mr. Claus.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.870
And what can we get
you for Christmas?

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:33.790
Well, first of all,
what's your name?

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.160
My name is Cedric, sir.

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.620
- Cedric, good name.
- Yes, thank you.

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.990
And what can I get you
for Christmas, Cedric?

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:39.660
I would like the
Harvard Classics.

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:42.160
The Harvard Classics.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.330
- Yes, sir.
- I can do that!

01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.990
- Thank you.
- In fact, done!

01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:46.950
Have a seat right here.

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:48.750
And what can I...
what's your name?

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.910
I'm Zoe.

01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:51.990
Zoe, great name.

01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:53.410
And what can I get you
for Christmas, Zoe?

01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:55.750
I'd like a red bow.

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:57.000
- A red bow.
- Yes.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.160
Zoe, done!

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.250
You'll see it Christmas morning.

01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:03.000
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.330
- What's your name, young lady?
- My name is Sarah.

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:06.910
Sarah, and what can I get
you for Christmas, Sarah?

01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:09.080
Can I get my own nail salon?

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.990
- Please?
- Here's the thing about that.

01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:17.120
What I can do, is I can
bring you all 64 colors

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.370
of all the nail polish you want.

01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:20.990
I can bring you
nail polish remover,

01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:22.990
I can bring you brushes,

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.990
I can bring you
hand-cleansing brushes,

01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:25.990
hand-cleansing soap,
I can bring you bowls

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:27.790
for soaking your fingernails.

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:29.410
But then you have to
develop it into a business,

01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:31.990
but I'll bring you all
the things to start, okay?

01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:34.410
Okay, thank you!

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:35.700
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.370
- You too.
- I just don't know sometimes.

01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:39.830
Come here, young man!

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:40.990
Have a seat right here
since you're a big boy.

01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:42.660
And tell me your name.

01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:44.500
- Drake.
- Drake!

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.080
Yeah.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.450
- Drake.
- Drake.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.660
Great men have
been named Drake.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:50.990
Yeah, like me.

01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.250
What do you want for Christmas?

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:53.290
A bunny.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:54.790
A bunny?

01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:57.830
Yeah, a bunny.

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:58.990
Uh-huh, I can do that!

01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:01.120
- But here's the
thing about bunnies.
- Okay.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.370
They fall in the
category of girlfriends.

01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:06.580
We have to get mom's okay.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.410

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:10.200
Cacie, what can I get
you for Christmas, Cacie?

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.830
Well, I would say
number three on my list

01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:16.120
is my own reality TV show.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.700
Okay here's the
thing about reality TV.

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.990
- I don't know anybody
at the networks.
- [sighs]

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:24.660
- So here's what
I'm going to have to do.
- Okay.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.450
I'm gonna have to let you
leave your phone number
with my elves.

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:29.540
- Will do.
- If we meet anybody with
one of the four majors.

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:33.120
- Perfect.
- We'll bring you up.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.200
- Awesome.
- But that's all we
can offer you then.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.500
- Okay, well.
- Is that enough?

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.160
- Help Santa out,
what's a narwhal?
- A narwhal?

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.120
It's like, it's kinda
like one of those things

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.990

swim around and it has like,

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:47.330
a big like, horn
sticking out of its head.

01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:49.580
- It's pretty cool.
- Alright, animals?

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.990
Animals, animals,
animals, I love animals.

01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:54.660
Whew, it's rough this year.
Come on, young man!

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.950
You're a little too
tall for this line,

01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:59.540
so squat down right there.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.990
