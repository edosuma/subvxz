I drove to Pennsylvania

14 convenience stores.

for over an hour.

and I took one look
at those evil eyes,

I knew she was up to no good.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.710

out the register,

out the Give A Penny,

does that?

04:43.920 --> 04:45.750

decided to bust Bernice out

04:48.620 --> 04:51.960
all on your own,
and then let her escape
all on your own?

04:51.960 --> 04:53.670
And then disguise
your best friend

04:53.670 --> 04:56.580
and put her in jail
all on your own?

04:56.580 --> 04:59.960

who robbed you, okay?

in the corner somewhere.

beef jerky.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.380
What was that for?!

05:52.380 --> 05:53.790
That was for coming with me

05:53.790 --> 05:55.170
when I clearly told you
I didn't need any help.

go scan the parking lot
for clues.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.040
five minutes ago.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.670
KC, the cops could be here
any second,

10:05.670 --> 10:06.920
and you've been identified.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.120
So we'll go in and talk
to the store clerk.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.580
Well, then, what am I
supposed to do?

10:10.580 --> 10:13.330
You just sit here, all alone,
and don't of anything.

10:13.330 --> 10:16.000
You know, pretend
it's one of your regular
Saturday nights.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.500

10:17.500 --> 10:19.380
Ha ha ha ha.
I don't know why
you're laughing.

KC Cooper,

10:29.330 --> 10:30.960
the Inconvenience Store Robber,

10:30.960 --> 10:32.000
has just been seen
heading east

10:32.000 --> 10:33.120
on Route 78.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.040
Ernie, Judy,
I've located Bernice.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.540
I'm gonna go get her.

10:39.540 --> 10:42.670
No! Don't go alone!
Wait for us!

10:42.670 --> 10:44.420
Guys, I got this, okay?

10:44.420 --> 10:46.080
I do not need your help.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.380

10:47.380 --> 10:49.000
I'm in pursuit.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.920

10:55.920 --> 10:57.460

10:58.830 --> 10:59.920
Hmm.

11:03.170 --> 11:05.170

11:16.580 --> 11:18.540
[Marisa's voice]
Hello, Mother.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.790
I am a teenage runaway,
and it is all your fault.

11:23.330 --> 11:26.540
Look, Marisa,
I know I did that thing

11:26.540 --> 11:28.420
that made you mad
and stuff,

11:28.420 --> 11:29.960
but enough is enough.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.210
It's time to come home now.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.120
I am not coming home,
Mother,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.580
and I honestly don't know
when I will be ready
to come home.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.710
So until then,
I bid you...adieu.

11:38.710 --> 11:42.580
Don't you sass me with
your fancy Cooper words.

11:42.580 --> 11:44.750
You're coming home with me
right now.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.000
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.290
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!

11:47.290 --> 11:49.710
No, I'm not!
What if I take you shopping?

11:49.710 --> 11:51.120
Can we buy Kira
something expensive

11:51.120 --> 11:53.000
to thank her for
her hospitality?
Sure!

11:53.000 --> 11:55.330
What are we waiting for, Mommy?
Let's go!

12:02.540 --> 12:07.580
Aha, there you are,
you beautiful-on-the-outside,
ugly-on-the-inside maniac.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.460
Okay. Ernie, Judy,
I got eyes on Bernice.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.250
Good teamwork, KC.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.170
We were supposed to be
doing this mission together.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.830
A big part of backing you up
is not being left back here.

12:22.580 --> 12:27.920
Well, if it isn't
ugly-on-the-outide,
ugly-on-the-inside KC.

psychopath!

12:44.580 --> 12:46.960
Go read a dictionary,
book worm!

12:48.670 --> 12:51.250
Having a fortitude
of loquaciousness

12:51.250 --> 12:52.790
is nothing to be ashamed of.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.380
In other words, having
a good vocabulary is cool!

KC Cooper,

13:02.080 --> 13:04.250
we recognize
your face of danger.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.210
Exit your vehicle
with your hands up.

13:07.210 --> 13:10.290
[Bernice revs engine]

13:11.830 --> 13:14.120
[sighs]

13:14.120 --> 13:15.620
Hey, uh, Ernie?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.290
Judy? Ha ha.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.620
Something kind of funny happened

13:18.620 --> 13:20.080
while I was trying
to track down Bernice.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.620
We know.
You're getting arrested.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.290
How'd you guys know that?

13:24.290 --> 13:26.080
Uh, we're watching it
on the news.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.290
But hey, on the bright side,

13:30.290 --> 13:32.830
you did it all on your own.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.710
Hey, guys.

13:41.290 --> 13:42.710
Why are we raising suspicions

13:42.710 --> 13:45.330
by having an 11-year-old
behind the wheel?

13:45.330 --> 13:47.620
Hey, when your feet are long
enough to reach the pedals,

13:47.620 --> 13:50.080
you can drive.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.250
Why are we even bothering
to help KC at this point?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.620
Based on Bernice's
pattern of robbery,

13:55.620 --> 13:57.210
she's heading
north-by-northeast,

13:57.210 --> 13:59.620
which means she can only
be heading to one place:

13:59.620 --> 14:02.920
Iceland! She's gonna hide
in the Land of Fire and Ice!

14:05.250 --> 14:08.830
Hey, look at that,
I grabbed a car that has
more than one dipstick.

14:10.170 --> 14:13.170
Bernice is heading
to Park Avenue
in New York City.

14:13.170 --> 14:15.500
Where there are rich people,
there are plastic surgeons,

14:15.500 --> 14:18.710
and Bernice wants nothing more
than to get her old face back.

14:18.710 --> 14:22.290
So she's been robbing
the convenience stores
to pay for her surgery!

14:22.290 --> 14:25.380
What if we're already too late
and she has a new face?

14:25.380 --> 14:28.000
Then we'll just beat it down
till it looks like KC again.

14:32.290 --> 14:36.000
So, what do you
feel like ordering?

14:36.000 --> 14:40.120
I'm wondering if they have
that shrimp pasta special?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.500
Marisa! You're allergic
to shrimp!

14:43.750 --> 14:45.620
Yeah, I know, I know.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.330
I was just making sure that--

14:47.330 --> 14:49.170
that they didn't have it

14:49.170 --> 14:51.210
in anything I order.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.330
You know, Mom,
thank you so much for
taking me shopping today.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.960
I know Kira is gonna love
those expensive, fancy shoes
we got her.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.080
You put so much thought
into that gift

15:04.080 --> 15:06.420
you'd think you were
buying 'em for yourself.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.250
[forced laughter]

15:08.250 --> 15:11.210
Well, you always taught me
to be generous, so...

15:11.210 --> 15:13.580
No... No, I didn't.

15:15.210 --> 15:16.830
I did have fun with you today.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.830
You are really growing up.

15:18.830 --> 15:22.790
You know, Lucy--
uh, I mean, Mom...

15:22.790 --> 15:24.750
I had fun too.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.330
I'm really lucky
I have you.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.210
Tell me about it.

15:28.210 --> 15:31.880
Can you imagine
if you'd be stuck with
that Kira as a mother?

15:31.880 --> 15:34.460
Excuse me?

15:35.960 --> 15:38.000
Well, I mean, I--I don't mean
to talk out of turn,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.120
but that Kira is a real mess.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.580
[fake laughter]
Well, I don't know
about that.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.250
KC's a straight-A student.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.790
Well, of course she is.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.040
She spends all of her time
at the library

15:48.040 --> 15:49.880
away from that mother of hers.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.420
She's...

15:51.420 --> 15:53.290
sketchy, that Kira.

15:55.210 --> 15:58.460
If by "sketchy"
you mean loving,
dedicated

15:58.460 --> 16:00.000
and still got it goin' on.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.830
Well, I'll tell ya,
something's goin' on,

16:01.830 --> 16:04.290
because I once saw her
at two-thirty in the morning

16:04.290 --> 16:07.040
getting into a van
with a strange man--

16:07.040 --> 16:09.170
who was tied up!

16:11.250 --> 16:13.250
Well, you know what, maybe
you should be worrying about

16:13.250 --> 16:15.290
where your own daughter is
at night.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.380
Where are you at night?

16:18.380 --> 16:21.290
[stammers] In my room,
praying,

16:21.290 --> 16:24.380
and thinking about how grateful
I am to have you as a mom.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.330
Now, we weren't
talking about me,

16:26.330 --> 16:28.250
we were talking about
that hot mess Kira.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.540
She's awful, isn't she?

16:31.620 --> 16:33.920
Okay, let's find Bernice.

From Paris?

16:38.120 --> 16:40.120
Uh, yes.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.080
Uh, I mean, oui.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.500
Arent you a little young
to be a plastic surgeon?

16:45.500 --> 16:48.750
[French accent]
Well, that ees because,
I was, how you say it,

16:48.750 --> 16:50.330
child prodigy.

16:50.330 --> 16:53.330
I graduated medical school
at fourteen.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.830
Oh, impressive.
And you are?

16:55.830 --> 16:58.250
Uh, these is my surgical nurse.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.500

17:03.330 --> 17:05.330
Is this some kind of joke?

17:05.330 --> 17:07.380
This is obviously a child.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.210
Ha! Ha!

17:09.210 --> 17:11.380

How flattering.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.620
I'm actually a patient
of Dr. Depardieu's,

17:13.620 --> 17:16.040
and I'm sixty-two years young!

17:16.040 --> 17:18.330
But shhh.
Don't tell my boyfriend.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.210
Wow! You are good.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.420
Your patient is waiting for you
in operating room A.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.120
Is this patient's name
Bernice?

17:26.120 --> 17:28.040
No, it's Harold.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.830
In that case,
we need to consult
with Dr. Tuckfeld.

17:30.830 --> 17:34.380
Dr. Tuckfeld
is about to start surgery
in operating room B.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.380
Well, B is where we'll be.
Right, Dr. Depardieu?

17:37.380 --> 17:39.880
Oui, oui. B-B.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.420
Bye-bye!

17:42.420 --> 17:44.420
Hurry it up, doc,
I can't wait to get rid of

17:44.420 --> 17:46.420

excuse for a face.

17:46.420 --> 17:48.380
Not that I mind the business,

17:48.380 --> 17:51.750
but I'm not a proponent of
unnecessary plastic surgery.

with a backpack

21:08.540 --> 21:11.420
Oh, KC, look,
you're on TV.

21:11.420 --> 21:13.620
...in a case
of mistaken identity,

21:13.620 --> 21:18.040
the Inconvenience Store Robber
was falsely identified
as KC Cooper.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.830
The real KC Cooper,
who had nothing to do
with the robberies,

21:21.830 --> 21:24.460
is a straight-A student,
a model citizen,

21:24.460 --> 21:27.120
and a lover of all animals.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.670
Wow. You guys
really think of everything.

21:30.670 --> 21:33.330
I didn't call that in.
Neither did I.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.210
What? Some stuff

21:36.210 --> 21:38.330
you still gotta do
all on your own.

21:41.580 --> 21:42.960
[woman] Rob,
your name's on TV!

21:42.960 --> 21:44.250
[boing]
