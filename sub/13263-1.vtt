So how old are you?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.166
Thirty-two, sir.

01:41.202 --> 01:45.370
Thirty-two,
good for you.

01:45.439 --> 01:49.641
Did you know
there are 365 steps

01:49.643 --> 01:52.310
leading up
to the Capitol Building?

01:52.379 --> 01:54.646
One for each day
of the year.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.182
I didn't
know that, sir.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.451
Hm.

01:59.586 --> 02:04.122
Now, I understand you're good
at getting the job done.

02:04.158 --> 02:08.060
This ain't
the kids' table.

02:08.062 --> 02:11.463
So I'm sure
you'll understand

02:11.598 --> 02:13.599
when I ask you
the question,

02:13.734 --> 02:17.736
why, Noah McManus,

02:17.871 --> 02:20.606
do you want this job?

02:23.610 --> 02:26.145
When I was 8 years old,

02:26.280 --> 02:28.013
my parents took me
to see the Liberty Bell.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.484
On July 8, 1776,

02:32.486 --> 02:34.219
people gathered to hear
the first reading

02:34.221 --> 02:36.020
of the Declaration
of Independence,

02:36.056 --> 02:40.225
spoke of the injuries,
the deprivations,

02:40.227 --> 02:42.494
the neglect
people had suffered

02:42.496 --> 02:45.430
under
a corrupt system.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.366
And the men
who forged it,

02:47.501 --> 02:51.637
they put everything on the line
to defend their fellow man.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.307
They fought for
a better way of life.

02:58.913 --> 03:02.313
Senator Hayden,

03:02.349 --> 03:04.582
I've seen you fight too.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.119
I've seen you fight
for the disenfranchised,

03:07.254 --> 03:10.522
the forgotten,
the destitute.

03:10.524 --> 03:15.193
I know that you strive
to make the difference.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.996
And as the current chief
of staff to the mayor of Boston,

03:18.065 --> 03:22.000
I strive too,
every single day.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.804
But I know, senator,
that it is your office

03:25.939 --> 03:29.540
that has the power to affect
lives throughout the country.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.943
And I believe
that every person

03:31.979 --> 03:34.679
has the right
to be served,

03:34.748 --> 03:37.882
no matter
who they are.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.352
And I believe that
you feel the same way.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.287
And that--

03:42.356 --> 03:45.691
That is why I want
to work for you, sir.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.926
(Phone ringing)

03:51.198 --> 03:52.197
Yeah?

03:54.535 --> 03:55.500
We'll be right down.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.702
Senator,

03:57.738 --> 03:58.837
they're ready
for the vote.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.510
Pleasure
to meet you, Noah.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.745
And you, sir.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.316
We appreciate
you coming in.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.651
We'll be
in touch, okay?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.753
Sure, thanks.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.735
The senator had
one more question.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.037
Can you start
next Thursday?

04:33.807 --> 04:34.873
Of course.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.676
All right.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.544
(Mouthing words)

04:39.613 --> 04:41.612
Yes!

04:41.649 --> 04:43.415
(Ringing)

04:43.484 --> 04:44.416
So?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.150
NOAH:
<i>Schedule the movers.</i>

04:46.186 --> 04:48.220
What?
You got it?

04:48.222 --> 04:49.955
Wendy, it was crazy.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.623
I was sitting there
and I don't know

04:51.758 --> 04:52.691
what came over
me, you know?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.158
but all of a sudden--
When do you start?

04:54.194 --> 04:55.293
<i>Next week.</i>

04:55.296 --> 04:57.295
I still can't
believe it.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.231
Anyway, if we
leave Monday,

04:59.366 --> 05:00.899
drive down and start looking
for a place we could--

05:00.968 --> 05:01.967
<i>We?</i>

05:04.171 --> 05:07.639
Noah, I thought you understood
the ramifications of this, Noah.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.441
Ramifications?

05:09.443 --> 05:11.309
And could you not say my
name twice in a sentence?

05:11.378 --> 05:12.311
<i>It kind
of freaks me out.</i>

05:12.412 --> 05:13.578
Noah, listen to me.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.580
Live-in girlfriend is
not a prestigious title.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.315
And by the way,
I already own it.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.117
Moving requires more.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.120
Fiancé, wife,
those are titles, Noah.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.921
Wendy--
<i>Noah, my parents are expecting</i>

05:23.957 --> 05:27.192
an announcement soon,
and quite frankly, so am I.

05:27.194 --> 05:31.062
Can't I just enjoy this moment,
you know, without this moment?

05:31.065 --> 05:33.131
<i>Sweetie, enjoy it all you want,
but while you're in it,</i>

05:33.266 --> 05:34.465
<i>celebrating all alone,</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:36.134
just know that if we
are not married,

05:36.203 --> 05:39.271
that is what you're
entire life will be like.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.072
Nice, Wendy.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.208
I'll see you tonight.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.111
Can't wait.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.322
I got to go.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.663
(Sighing)

06:08.368 --> 06:09.434
No way.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.768
You want to bet?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.304
Congratulations!

06:13.340 --> 06:14.839
I can't believe this!
What was it like?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.174
Well--
What am I asking what it was like for?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.175
You got the job.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.310
It was amazing.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.578
God, this is crazy.
Yeah, yeah.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.514
And you know what else is crazy?
What's that?

06:22.649 --> 06:24.416
I think I'm going
to propose to Wendy.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.118
Now?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.186
Yeah.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.587
Now?
Now.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.657
Noah, you're about to start
the job of a lifetime,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.859
a job you've
wanted forever,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.194
move to a city
you've never lived in,

06:36.263 --> 06:38.062
and simultaneously you want
to start planning a wedding?

06:38.132 --> 06:39.064
You're going
to ask her now?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.599
This is not sounding
like a good idea.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.268
I just want you to know that
as a friend, your best friend.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.602
You're being negative.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.605
No, I'm just stating
the facts and my opinion,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.340
which is that
you're totally nuts.

06:48.342 --> 06:51.076
Come on, just support me even
though you don't agree with me.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.877
Best friends do that
for each other sometimes.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.347
Yeah, I know, and I've
never understood that.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.950
(Sighing)

06:58.986 --> 07:00.819
You going to be able to survive
around here without me?

07:00.954 --> 07:03.355
The Red Sox might
missy you, but I won't.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.291
All right.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.360
No, no, no, wait.
I was just joking.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.294
I was just joking.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.962
It was crazy, man.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.502
"Mayor Grantt and District
Attorney Perkins in dead heat."

07:17.538 --> 07:19.838
"Grantt's lead vanishes."

07:19.840 --> 07:22.106
If everyone isn't aware by now,
I'm an incumbent mayor.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.709
The election is in three weeks,
and I've lost my lead.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.244
Mayor Grantt,
looking at the polls,

07:26.313 --> 07:27.712
it seems that
the voters feel

07:27.714 --> 07:29.180
that you're out of touch
with their daily lives.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.181
Therefore?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.516
You and Mr. Grantt enjoy

07:31.552 --> 07:33.784
two lovely
multi-million-dollar homes,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.854
one in Beacon Hill
and one in Nantucket.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.655
Wave your salary
for the term,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.190
and in exchange
for your services,

07:39.259 --> 07:41.259
you will accept
a fee of $1.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.460
I should work for nothing?

07:42.496 --> 07:44.729
It's a buck.
Better be something else.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.198
Offer discounted
transportation

07:46.333 --> 07:47.999
to all city residents
on election day.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.668
That way we encourage
every registered voter

07:49.803 --> 07:50.935

polling place.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.003

actions, not words.

Randal's family has been

23:48.127 --> 23:50.760
Randall managed to build
himself a small fortune

23:50.797 --> 23:53.497
by buying up real
estate in different places

23:53.499 --> 23:55.632
and turning it
into strip malls.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.034

the same thing here.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.904
Randall wants to build
an outlet shopping center

24:00.940 --> 24:02.373
and a movie complex.

24:02.508 --> 24:03.440
We're all in bed by 9:00.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.976
Who's going to go
there, anyway?

get why Harpswell

things to all people.

24:12.518 --> 24:16.520
What's wrong with being
a small town in a big world?

24:16.655 --> 24:19.656
Anyway, in a few weeks,

24:19.725 --> 24:21.792
someone's going
to be elected.

24:21.861 --> 24:26.130
So who's
the other candidate?

24:27.733 --> 24:28.866
Me.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.068
Wow.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.004
I guess when you're old,
people think you really know,

24:34.139 --> 24:38.008
plus nobody else wanted
to go up against him.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.109
Well, look at that.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.545
Cupcake?

24:41.547 --> 24:43.880
Randall, is nothing
sacred to you?

24:43.916 --> 24:46.083
This is our
Preservation dinner.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.818
We are having some
community time here.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.620
You agreed
not to campaign.

24:49.755 --> 24:53.290
Lillian's right. We're just here
for a nice neighborly dinner.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.226
You can't buy our
votes, Randall.

24:55.361 --> 24:57.027
And no one wants your
shopping center either.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.095
Well, I think some
people do, right?

24:59.131 --> 25:01.899
And in a short time,
we'll know just how many.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.368
Now, look, can
we just calm down?

25:04.370 --> 25:05.836
He's right.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.906
Randall's plan will open a lot
of doors for a town like this.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.507
Now, lay off
of him.

25:10.576 --> 25:11.842
Yeah.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.244
Well, maybe some of us
don't want to calm down.

25:13.379 --> 25:14.645
Am I right?
Yeah.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.046
I mean, let's hear
from everyone.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.981
Am I right?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.116
Me?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.784
Why not?

25:20.853 --> 25:21.852
Um...

25:21.854 --> 25:23.521
Okay.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.992
Well, I hear you.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.928
You know, I understand
your concerns.

25:30.930 --> 25:35.198
Shopping center
would probably mean,

25:35.268 --> 25:38.669
you know,
more attention, you know?

25:38.738 --> 25:40.671
Which would mean
more traffic.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.540
You know, crowded roads

25:43.576 --> 25:46.143
and littering.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.678
Littering could
be a concern.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.881
But on the other
hand, you know,

25:51.016 --> 25:54.284
this project could mean
more spending, you know?

25:54.287 --> 25:55.419
Which could mean
more income,

25:55.554 --> 25:57.354
which in turn could benefit
the housing sector

25:57.356 --> 25:58.889
and the employment sector

25:59.024 --> 26:00.958
and eventually increasing
teachers' salaries.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.628
You know, thereby allowing you
to attract better teachers

26:04.763 --> 26:05.829
and therefore,
more families.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.899
You know,
before you know it, this--

26:09.034 --> 26:13.404

really blossom.

26:16.175 --> 26:20.243
Look, Arlo and I
have only been here

26:20.279 --> 26:24.915
for 2 hours
and 14 minutes, you know?

26:25.050 --> 26:27.051
And Harpswell seems like
a pretty incredible place.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.852
I mean, you have a really
special hotel here,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.588
Sam, Lillian.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.591
And really great food.

really sure

I just think you'd
be very helpful to me.

is a fisherman.

44:49.821 --> 44:51.554

The thing is, I always
wanted to go with him.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.561
For as long as I can remember,
I would go on Dad's boat,

44:58.696 --> 45:00.430
and I would never
want to leave.

45:00.565 --> 45:03.699
And when I finished school and I
was finally old enough to go,

45:03.702 --> 45:05.101
my mom wasn't well.

45:05.236 --> 45:07.770

to stay here.

45:07.905 --> 45:09.505
And then she passed away,

45:09.640 --> 45:14.042
and I told my dad that I was
ready to go and work with him.

45:14.079 --> 45:15.711

like, the only way

45:15.780 --> 45:17.180
that I could really
get to know him better.

45:17.182 --> 45:19.248
But he thought that
it was too dangerous.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.919

and bought me a present.

45:24.122 --> 45:25.454

was leaving, and I did.

46:58.283 --> 47:02.485

just too busy to realize

thought about me either.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.694
that people come out
and vote for you.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.629
You know, maybe you
should take the day off.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.765
Go talk
to people, you know?

50:36.801 --> 50:38.767
Gather support.

50:38.803 --> 50:40.836
The inn will be fine.

50:40.838 --> 50:42.905
I'm like the only
person left here.

50:43.040 --> 50:47.176
Noah, I'm not the kind
of guy to do the hard sell.

50:47.311 --> 50:48.577
I'm just not
that good at it.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.179
Oh, come on.

50:50.248 --> 50:52.581
Heck, I don't even like
talking out loud that much.

50:52.650 --> 50:55.183
I just don't
get why Randall

50:55.219 --> 50:56.986
wants this job
in the first place.

50:56.988 --> 50:58.254
He's got
a business to run.

50:58.389 --> 51:02.258
He's always flying off
to some faraway place.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.593
He doesn't
want this job.

51:04.595 --> 51:06.996
Just a big
joke to him.

51:06.998 --> 51:09.198
Also he's on
the Preservation Council,

51:09.333 --> 51:11.733
and he's always tried to ensure
that no roads or beaches

51:11.769 --> 51:12.868
in front of his house

51:12.870 --> 51:15.938
should be accessible
to the general public.

51:15.940 --> 51:19.341
Apparently, he has no regard
for anyone or anything else.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.942
Yeah.

51:20.978 --> 51:24.213
I just want this town
to live on as it always has.

51:24.282 --> 51:25.681
I hear you, Sam.

51:25.683 --> 51:26.949
I better get going.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.685
Lillian's going to wonder
what happened to me.

51:29.754 --> 51:39.762
♪

51:54.445 --> 51:55.578
Good morning, Doug.

51:55.580 --> 51:58.247
Yup.

51:58.316 --> 52:00.316
Hm.

52:08.993 --> 52:11.259
Oh, nice.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.129
Don't touch.

52:13.264 --> 52:14.263
What are you
doing today?

52:14.332 --> 52:18.067
I'm not
doing anything.

52:18.202 --> 52:19.335
You better brush up.

52:19.337 --> 52:21.137
They're going
to be here any minute.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.871
Who?

52:22.907 --> 52:25.207
NOAH:
It all started

52:25.276 --> 52:26.741
with Christopher
Columbus, okay?

52:26.777 --> 52:29.811
Christopher Columbus
was an adventurous,

52:29.847 --> 52:31.614
young Italian,
you know?

52:31.616 --> 52:34.350
And he wanted to go
and visit India.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.418
So he goes
to Princess Isabella. He says,

52:36.420 --> 52:40.222
(Italian accent) "Hey, Princess
Isabella, I need a couple ships."

52:40.357 --> 52:41.957
You know,
and Princess Isabella says,

52:41.993 --> 52:44.626
(High-pitch voice) "Oh, Columbus,
I will give you three ships,

52:44.662 --> 52:48.564
the Niña, the Pinta
and the Santa Maria."

52:48.633 --> 52:50.132
"Oh, thank you
very much, my queen."

52:52.236 --> 52:54.769
"Oh, you're very
welcome, Christopher."

52:54.805 --> 52:57.139
(Cheering)

53:00.178 --> 53:02.378
Who here has
been on a boat?

CHILDREN:
Me!

53:06.851 --> 53:08.250
All of you?

53:08.286 --> 53:09.185
Yup.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.252
Let's play
hide-and-seek.

53:10.288 --> 53:12.588
GIRL:
Sure.

53:13.991 --> 53:14.924
They loved you.

53:15.059 --> 53:17.293
Aw, go on.

53:19.330 --> 53:20.329
Hey, that's mine.

53:20.398 --> 53:21.596
But I don't have anymore.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.465
Tough.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.000
Trade you some
of my milk.

53:25.002 --> 53:26.335
I don't want your milk.
I want my cookie.

53:26.404 --> 53:28.537
"I don't want your milk.
I want my cookie."

53:28.672 --> 53:32.408
Oh, oh, here, fine.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.676
There you go.

53:33.678 --> 53:37.580
Thank you.
That's very generous of you.

(Arlo whimpering)

53:47.358 --> 53:49.425
I know, I know.

53:49.427 --> 53:52.828
You want to take your romantic
walk on the beach with me.

53:55.266 --> 53:57.232
Hang on, buddy.

WENDY: So they go on a beach
walking hand in hand, huh?

54:25.129 --> 54:28.063
Stay.

I mean it.
Stay.

LILLIAN:
Enjoying it?

Yes, it's delicious.

SAM:
Lillian is a genius at making cocoa.

54:39.744 --> 54:41.210
Always has been.

54:41.212 --> 54:42.745
I can tell.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.381
Noah, you're back.

54:47.218 --> 54:50.519
Lillian, would you mind bringing
Arlo up to the room, please?

54:51.822 --> 54:53.956
Not at all.

Thank you
for the cocoa.

54:56.027 --> 54:58.494
Mm.

So delicious.

Boy, is there anything
around here I don't do?

Good night, Sam.

I will.

Noah.

55:15.746 --> 55:20.248
You were right.

55:20.284 --> 55:23.718
We would have loved
being here together.

55:23.754 --> 55:28.390
Look, Noah,
I am so hoping

55:28.426 --> 55:30.726
that now that we've
had some time apart,

55:30.728 --> 55:34.396
that we can move on.

55:34.432 --> 55:37.333
Move past
this hiccup.

55:37.468 --> 55:40.668
This hiccup?

55:40.705 --> 55:44.406
We can even go to counseling
if you feel you need it.

Or we can
just start over.

55:46.477 --> 55:49.411
Noah, I don't even care
that you lost the job in DC.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.880
Let me be perfectly
clear with you.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.149
I didn't lose
anything.

55:57.154 --> 55:58.287
You're not going
to believe this,

55:58.422 --> 56:01.489
but my parents
called this morning.

56:01.525 --> 56:05.627
They will buy us the house
in Cambridge that we love.

You forgot
your jacket.

Could you
excuse us, please?

56:36.860 --> 56:38.193
I'd like some
time with my fiancé.

56:38.229 --> 56:41.330
I am not your fiancé!

I'm sorry
to bother you.

Look, I don't know if
there's anything here for me,

nothing here for you.

No.

No, no, no,

57:29.446 --> 57:34.316
no, no, no, no!

Did you do this?

You did, didn't you?

Where is it, Arlo?

Tell me!

What did I
tell you, Arlo?

57:45.129 --> 57:46.328
Huh?

57:46.330 --> 57:47.662
Sticks, rocks, bones:

57:47.731 --> 57:49.798
these are the things
that you bury!

All right, bye.

It sucks.
We're out of the playoffs.

back to normal.

Hey, hey,
Jesse, remember me?

58:09.086 --> 58:12.087
I'm Noah, you know,
Hailey's friend, the good kid?

58:12.089 --> 58:13.155
Yeah.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.156
Yeah, well, look,
I got a situation,

58:15.226 --> 58:16.691
and I really need
your help, okay?

58:16.727 --> 58:19.027
Look, I bought this ring,
this engagement ring.

58:19.096 --> 58:20.028
I was going
to propose.

58:20.163 --> 58:21.096
That's why I came
to Harpswell.

58:21.231 --> 58:23.232
Anyway, I'm
at the Landing Inn,

58:23.367 --> 58:24.766
and I was up in my
room last night,

58:24.835 --> 58:26.501
and I was about
to take the dog for a walk.

58:26.570 --> 58:27.970
And, you know,
he likes the walks on the beach.

58:27.972 --> 58:29.705
And I think he had
the ring in his mouth.

58:29.707 --> 58:31.840
And, you know,
he likes to bury things,

58:31.842 --> 58:34.175
so I think he was, like,
digging in the sand.

58:34.211 --> 58:35.577

You ready for
this town meeting?

59:54.791 --> 59:56.058
I think.

59:56.060 --> 59:59.460

making speeches and such.

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.395
I know you'll do well.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.597
You just state your case.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:02.864
That's all
you need to do.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:06.000
And when someone asks
you a question, be direct.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:08.870
When someone asks
me a question?

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.873
Yeah, you know,
about the town.

01:00:12.009 --> 01:00:13.208

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:16.812
There's a big old pothole
in front of my shop.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.881
Visit or call
the Public Works office,

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.416
and if there's any
concern for safety,

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:22.951
it will be addressed
immediately.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.887
My grandmother needs
care that I can't give her.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.622
Work with
the Council on Aging.

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:29.558

I can't afford
a fishing permit this year.

Can you help me out?

01:00:32.563 --> 01:00:33.895
That's easy.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.631
Go to the Coast Resources
Permit Department,

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:36.898
and they'll
give you a map

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.966
of where permits aren't
required for fishing.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.035
Why should
I vote for you?

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.104
Because I am
going to make sure

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.175
that this town
retains its heart

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.376
and its soul.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:49.378
But don't you think
there's an opportunity

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:51.646
for growth under
the Randall plan?

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:55.250
Excellent question
but I have an answer.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:57.919
Look at all small towns that
have welcomed big business.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:59.788
All the stores
look the same.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:01.857
Nobody has time
to know your name

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:03.258
or ask you
how you're doing.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.594
They're all too busy
restocking the shelves.

01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:07.596
You know,
and then the highway

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:09.731
is going
to overflow with cars.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.265
And you're not going to want
to go to Main Street

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.669
because you're not going to be
able to find a place to park.

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:17.138
You know, so, yeah, you know,
I see it as an opportunity,

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:21.443
an opportunity to change
everything for the worse.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.283
How was that?

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:29.484
You're it!

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.353
What?

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.420
No.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:35.556
You are it.
You should be town manager.

01:01:35.592 --> 01:01:36.624
You're joking.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.026
You're just a natural.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:42.297
Really, I'm flattered,
really, but that's nuts.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:43.498
You're the one running.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.269
I'm just here
supporting you.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:50.906
Okay?

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.509
If you say so.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:02:04.619
♪

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.140
Hi.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:28.076
Hi.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.078
Look, I'm really
sorry, okay?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.880
I had no idea Wendy
was coming here.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:33.148
Noah, you don't
owe me anything.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.349
In fact, I don't even
want to know anything,

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:35.817
so let's just
forget it, okay?

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:36.951
Wait.

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:38.286
You owe me something.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:39.821
Excuse me?

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.423
I've been waiting here
for you for four hours, okay?

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:43.625
Right here.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.693
So the least
you could do

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:45.827
is just give me a little
bit of your time.

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:47.562
All right?

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:48.630
Okay.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:51.767
I came here
to tell you

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:55.436
that I don't know
what I'm doing here

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:58.439
in this town,
at this point.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:01.843
I mean, I could absolutely
leave right this minute.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:03.178
You know, but this
is the first time in my life

01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.779
where I have
no purpose.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:07.915
And I'm actually
okay with it.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.850
You know?

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.952
Just existing.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.256
I mean, yeah,
you know,

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.726
I got to figure out
what's next and I will.

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:19.861
But for right now,

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:22.063
I'm totally
comfortable

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:25.801
just being
here with you.

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:33.074
And I'm grateful

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.409
for that.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.845
Okay?

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:42.417
So you-- You have
any thoughts on that?

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.489
Anything at all?

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:50.959
I caught a fish.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.460
You did?

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:54.963
Let me see.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.431
You don't
believe me.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.700
I just want
to see the fish.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.704
Ugh, that's horrible!

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.172
It's a grouper.
It's disgusting.

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:06.574
It's delicious.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:08.643
You know, you really should
throw this thing back.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.710
I'm going
to eat it.

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:10.645
Bury it.
Tonight.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.247
I think it deserves
a proper burial.

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:13.314
I'm going
to fry it up.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.349
It's going to be delicious.
Ugh.

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.290
Have you seen this?

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.861
Yeah, I talked
to the reporter about that.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:27.863
She didn't get
the story straight.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:28.863
Yeah, well,
straight or not,

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:30.398
people believe
what they read.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:32.867
And they're saying that
my campaign is suffering,

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:36.271
that voters are uncertain
about my effectiveness,

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:37.672
that I may not be
"of the people" enough

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:38.673
to represent them.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:42.610
So what now, Elliot, hm?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:45.280
Noah had plans for my
campaign. What do you have?

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:46.814
We're doing
everything we can.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.616
No, that's not
good enough.

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:49.618
I don't think
you have what it takes

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.419
to put me over the top.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.621
I need a new line-up.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:56.290
I'm sorry, Elliot,
but that's it.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:05:01.029
What if I can get
Noah to come back?

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:02.230
What?

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.764
You don't have time
to bring in a new team.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.634
Please, let me
just get Noah.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.569
I can do that.

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:10.238
You and I both know
that's what you want.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.606
You just won't say it.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:15.443
Then do it.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.185
RANDALL:
And as I've indicated,

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:27.656
the flow of traffic
will in no way interfere

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:30.658
with the school buses during
afternoon dismissal, okay?

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.061
I don't want those people
parking in front of my property.

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.396
Now, Mrs. Potiker,

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:36.731
I can guarantee that
that's not going to happen.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:39.600
Yeah, right.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.535
Sam, aren't you
going to say anything?

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.071
Of course her property is going
to be impacted by this project.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:46.407
RANDALL: Look, we're going to
have arcades for the kids.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:48.943
We're going to have reasonably
priced restaurants.

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:51.012
He's just trying to distract
people from the issues.

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.682
What about
the restaurants in town?

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.216
Aren't those good
enough for him?

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:59.020
Come on, Sam,
say something.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:01.089
What about Sole's
Hobby Shop?

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.757
If that scrapbook store,

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.759
that sports store
and that candle shop move in,

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:05.894
what is he left with?

01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:07.161
Yeah.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.496
MAN:
Yeah, what about that?

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.631
These stores are going
to bring in more people,

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:13.635
more customers
and more money for everybody.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:14.702
It's a win-win.

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.971
This guy is unbelievable.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.973
Are you just going
to sit there, Sam?

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.442
Me?

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:21.977
When are you going to stop
telling everybody else

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.145
what to do
and just do it yourself?

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.181
Great, well, to conclude,

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.116
I'd just like to reiterate--

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:29.851
NOAH:
I can't let you go on.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.454
It's not true
and you know it.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.189
Noah, sit down, okay?

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:35.523
Of course the stores
on Main Street

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.858
are going to be affected.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.860
I mean, this mall is going
to affect every business.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.062
But, Randall,

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:44.999
you're running for town
manager, not developer.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.868
Does anyone
have a question

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:50.805
about how to acquire
fishing permits?

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:53.607
Or where to go if you need help
with an elderly family member?

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:56.811
Or what to do if you have a
pothole in front of your house?

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.613
And tell us, Randall,

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.482
what would you suggest
to your fellow neighbors

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:04.552
who are experiencing
these situations, huh?

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:07.822
Well, uh, since
you know so much,

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.524
why don't you run
for town manager?

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:16.197
What in the world?

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.198
Hey.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:19.634
Could I just-- ?

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.639
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.374
Sorry.

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:27.575
What's going on?

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:28.643
Why'd you come all
the way out here?

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:29.911
I need you.
I'm desperate.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.246
Grantt is about
to fire me,

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.447
and you're the only thing
that's going to save me.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:33.647
Please come back.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.715
Elliot.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:35.917
If you don't come
back, I'm out.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.386
Please, don't make me
work for my father-in-law.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:39.454
Please, I'm begging you.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:40.655
Look, I'm on my knees.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.190
What?
W-w-what are you doing?

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:45.927
Would you-- ?
Get up.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.595
Look, Elliot,
she'd never let me.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:48.796
Let you?

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.331
She needs you.
She wants you.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:51.932
Look, she'll even
tell you herself.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:55.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no,
I don't want to talk to her.

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:56.271
It's all right.
Don't worry.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:57.938
Elliot.
Hey, it's Elliot.

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:59.340
Would you put Grantt
on the line?

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.009
This will be good.
Yeah.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:04.079
Yeah, hang on.
He's right here.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:09.751
(Mouthing words)

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:11.952
Mayor Grantt.

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:14.355
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:15.390
(Mouthing words)

01:08:17.094 --> 01:08:18.158
Right.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:19.828
Guys, come on.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.962
Give them some
privacy. Go, go, go.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.433
Who's watching the store?

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:28.903
I got the best friend
in the whole world right here!

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:30.772
Yeah, you do.

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:33.508
All right.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.243
You know I don't
want to go.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:39.314
Right now I just think we
should be supporting Sam.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.416
Right.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.060
Well, I guess
I should get going.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.862
Now, if there's
anything you forgot,

01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:57.332
you just call us,
and we'll get it to you.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.399
Thanks, Lillian.

01:08:58.435 --> 01:08:59.801
Thanks for everything.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:05.273
And we're going
to miss you, little guy.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.474
I'm going to be
checking in.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:10.544
I know you're going
to do well, Sam.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.081
Well, we'll see.

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.582
You take care, Noah.

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:21.356
You too.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.761
Come on, Arlo.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.032
Arlo, you got
to get in.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.033
Don't look
at me like that.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.234
Come on, go.

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:36.237
(Lillian chuckling)

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:41.542
(Engine starting)

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:10.204
Hey.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.140
Hey.

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:14.342
I wanted to see you
before I left.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:17.011
Yeah, I was just
about to come to you.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:22.616
Um, baked you cookies.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:23.618
I was going
to take one of those,

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.286
didn't want you
yelling at me.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.954
But they're for you.

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:28.022
For me?
Yeah.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:30.024
You made these?

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:31.960
Wow, well, that's--

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:35.029
That's, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.431
And these are for Arlo.

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:39.700
You made those too?

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.369
But save them for the road.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.905
Will do but I think

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.572
Arlo's probably going
to eat his immediately.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:47.609
I know.
He's allowed.

religious persecution.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.025
You know, he wants
to shepherd this town

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.427
through
the times ahead,

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:38.365
but he can only do
that with your votes.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.500
Look, I've been
in politics for a long time.

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.836
I've worked
for a mayor.

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:44.305
I've worked
for council people,

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.373
lawyers,
clerked for a judge

01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:50.110
and I nearly
worked for a senator.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.845
Now, I've seen
them all.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:54.848
And not one of those people
is as trustworthy

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:57.117
as the man standing
right here before you.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:21:00.854
Sam's one of the best
things about this town.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.188
Too little,
too late for this.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:03.457
We've already
heard the speeches.

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.726
I'm prepared
to vote for Randall.

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:06.660
Oh, my God.

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.395
MAN:
Who here is with me?

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:11.532
Hey, it's not a speech!
It's from his heart!

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:13.133
Let the kid talk!

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:14.200
(Mouthing words)

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:16.136
NOAH:
Thank you, Pete.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:21.208
You need a town manager that
will ensure that your family,

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.745
your business,
your dreams are possible

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.413
here in Harpswell.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.616
Yeah, Randall can bring
a few stores here.

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:32.486
But at what cost
to you and your families?

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:35.089
All of us,
as a community,

01:21:35.091 --> 01:21:37.491
have got to tell him that
he can't use this land

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.094
as a foundation
for his own bank account!

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.696
What?

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:45.099
You've got to really
think about this.

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:49.636
Who do you want
to be your town manager.

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:51.571
Huh?

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.240
Who?

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:57.444
I vote for him!

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:00.180
Huh?

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:01.115
PETE: Yeah!
MAN 3: Yeah.

01:22:01.117 --> 01:22:02.782
What?

01:22:02.818 --> 01:22:04.184
Do it, Noah.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.318
Stay here.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:06.720
Work for these people.

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:08.588
These are the people
who need you.

01:22:08.658 --> 01:22:11.392
Okay, personally,
I've had about enough of this.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:14.594
Noah, you've got
what it takes.

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:15.996
You've got experience.

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:17.264
You've got drive.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.465
You've got time.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:21.335
Look at me.
I'm not spring chicken.

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:22.602
I only got
into this thing

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:23.604
because I wanted
to make sure

01:22:23.739 --> 01:22:25.339
that the town
was in safe hands.

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:27.942
But with you,
I know it will be.

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:33.880
Sam, I don't know if I'm
prepared to do this.

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.682
You are.

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:37.751
You just didn't
expect it.

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:41.621
Noah, you love being
in the middle of things.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:44.557
You like figuring out why
things work or why they don't.

01:22:44.593 --> 01:22:46.159
You like helping people.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:49.095
You like figuring out
what people need.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.366
You're tireless
and you're dedicated

01:22:52.435 --> 01:22:53.834
to things
that you believe.

01:22:53.903 --> 01:22:57.237
And I think that you are
the perfect candidate.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.707
Are you out
of your mind?

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:02.176
This guys doesn't
even live here.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.378
He's not even
registered to vote.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.512
I don't want
him to vote.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.914
I want
him to win.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:10.583
That he can do.

01:23:10.619 --> 01:23:13.587
Okay, everybody,
there are two candidates here.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:14.855
There's Sam
and there's me.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.657
And that's it, okay?

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:20.060
Actually, Randall,

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.663
no person serving
in a council position--

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.064
I mean, you are on the
Preservation Council,

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:25.199
aren't you?

01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:26.199
Yeah.

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:27.267
No person shall challenge

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:28.268
a run for office

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.003
of this town's
administration

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:33.540
without abdicating their former
officer position first,

01:23:33.576 --> 01:23:36.143
which means, Randall,

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:38.812
you're not allowed
to run for town manager,

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:41.114
because you're already
holding another job here.

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:44.484
What?
That's bogus.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.819
Oh, really?

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.388
Maybe.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:51.091
Sir.

01:23:51.093 --> 01:23:54.628

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.496
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:57.431
Touching.

01:23:57.566 --> 01:23:58.565
Look, even
if that's true,

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.501
and I'm not even
sure that it is--

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:01.768
It is.

01:24:01.771 --> 01:24:04.771
don't you people want
a representative?

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:07.774
You know, someone
who actually lives here?

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:09.076
