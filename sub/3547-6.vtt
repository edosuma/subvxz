00:00.125 --> 00:02.166
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.250 --> 00:03.834
<i>Gabrielle got even.</i>

00:03.917 --> 00:05.875
So did I hurt you,
or should I keep trying?

00:05.959 --> 00:07.375
<i>Tom got an idea.</i>

00:07.458 --> 00:09.166
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlour!

00:09.250 --> 00:10.417
<i>Bree got a warning.</i>

00:10.500 --> 00:12.458
He's a cold-blooded killer.

00:12.542 --> 00:14.041
<i>The police got a clue.</i>

00:14.125 --> 00:16.750
Those blue marks,
I think it's a phone number.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.250
<i>You've reached Mike Delfino.</i>

00:19.333 --> 00:21.041
This should never have happened!

00:21.125 --> 00:23.917
<i>And the battle for Mike's affection</i>
<i>got ugly.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.750
How do you sleep at night?

00:25.834 --> 00:28.208
Soon, with Mike on top of me.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
<i>It is often said that confession</i>
<i>is good for the soul.</i>

00:37.083 --> 00:40.166
<i>No one knew this better</i>
<i>than a certain blonde</i>

00:40.250 --> 00:43.709
<i>who had been confessing her sins</i>
<i>to Father O'Malley</i>

00:43.792 --> 00:46.500
<i>once a week since she was a child.</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:50.875
<i>As the years had passed,</i>
<i>much to Father O'Malley's dismay,</i>

00:50.959 --> 00:53.375
<i>a theme began to emerge.</i>

00:54.792 --> 00:56.959
I seduced the cable guy again.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.959
I'm having an affair
with a folk-singing duo.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.458
Last week I let Rabbi Littman
get to third base.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.458
<i>And once she had been forgiven,</i>

01:10.542 --> 01:13.500
<i>Father O'Malley would tell Edie Britt</i>

01:13.583 --> 01:16.917
<i>to go out into the world</i>
<i>and sin no more.</i>

01:18.834 --> 01:20.959
<i>Unfortunately for Edie,</i>

01:21.041 --> 01:23.166
<i>temptation seemed to be...</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:24.834
Hello, there.

01:26.542 --> 01:27.834
<i>...everywhere.</i>

01:31.625 --> 01:35.333
Edie, what were we like together

01:36.458 --> 01:38.041
before the accident?

01:38.125 --> 01:39.667
What do you mean?

01:39.750 --> 01:42.458
You know, were we close?

01:44.458 --> 01:45.667
Honestly?

01:46.750 --> 01:52.667
We lived about 50 feet from each other,
and you barely knew that I existed.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.709
- Seriously?
- It's true.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.625
I mean, you weren't rude or anything.

01:57.709 --> 02:00.875
We'd wave or exchange hellos
as we went to get our mail,

02:00.959 --> 02:03.583
but you never really looked at me.

02:03.667 --> 02:07.417
Not really.
I was just another neighbour to you.

02:08.291 --> 02:13.250
Well, if we weren't friends, why
are you here every day helping me?

02:14.542 --> 02:18.875
Because from the first moment
I laid eyes on you,

02:21.041 --> 02:23.458
I sort of fell in love with you.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.500
Oh.

02:27.583 --> 02:30.208
I'm not telling you this
because I expect anything,

02:30.291 --> 02:32.458
so you can just relax, okay?

02:33.917 --> 02:35.291
Okay.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.166
But when you do come back home,

02:37.250 --> 02:41.208
and we do run into each other
when we're getting our mail,

02:41.792 --> 02:44.041
I'd really appreciate it if you'd

02:45.750 --> 02:47.291
just look at me.

02:49.208 --> 02:50.625
That's all.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.625
I'm looking at you now.

03:08.291 --> 03:14.458
<i>Yes. It is often said</i>
<i>confession is good for the soul.</i>

03:15.041 --> 03:18.875
Mike Delfino and I made out today.
And it was great!

03:20.125 --> 03:26.041
<i>But some confessions</i>
<i>are just bragging in disguise.</i>

04:10.041 --> 04:13.041
<i>There was nothing Bree Hodge</i>
<i>hated more</i>

04:13.125 --> 04:17.041
<i>than an unexpected knock at the door.</i>

04:17.750 --> 04:22.500
<i>She was always certain it would</i>
<i>lead to a disagreeable surprise.</i>

04:23.667 --> 04:27.333
<i>Whether it be in the form</i>
<i>of a cosmetics saleswoman,</i>

04:27.417 --> 04:29.542
<i>religious zealots,</i>

04:29.625 --> 04:31.750
<i>or extended family.</i>

04:32.458 --> 04:35.333
<i>But on this day,</i>
<i>the surprise awaiting Bree</i>

04:35.417 --> 04:39.959
<i>was far more disagreeable</i>
<i>than she ever could have imagined.</i>

04:41.500 --> 04:43.417
- Hello, Bree.
- Carolyn.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.250
This isn't a very good time.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.208
- I'm baking.
- Bree.

04:48.291 --> 04:51.375
Oh, hi. We haven't met.
I'm Harvey Bigsby.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.458
And I brought my wife here
to apologise.

04:56.542 --> 04:59.709
It's a soufflÃ©, and timing is everything.

04:59.792 --> 05:02.125
Please, please.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.542
She's been under a great deal of stress
since Alma's disappearance,

05:05.625 --> 05:08.041
and she really hasn't been herself.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.583
Much of that was due
to the Mexican painkillers

05:10.667 --> 05:13.917
that she was purchasing online,
but I put a stop to that.

05:15.917 --> 05:19.458
Well, Orson tells me
that the two of you were very close,

05:19.542 --> 05:23.000
and out of respect for that friendship,
I'm all ears.

05:24.875 --> 05:28.375
After thinking it over, I realised
that maybe I was out of line...

05:28.458 --> 05:32.583
Definitely out of line with the
terrible accusations that I made.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.041
I'm deeply sorry
for the pain that I caused.

05:35.125 --> 05:38.458
I hope that you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

05:40.041 --> 05:44.250
Well, I can appreciate how difficult
that must have been for you.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.333
Apology accepted.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.125
- I'm so relieved.
- As am I.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.542
Well, you don't know how rusty
my golf game's gotten

05:54.625 --> 05:56.667
without this one
keeping me on my toes.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.875
Well, perhaps we can all get together
for dinner at the club sometime.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.709
- That sounds lovely.
- Great.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.208
Darling, you are amazing,
you know that?

06:07.291 --> 06:10.959
To rise above all that unpleasantness
with such dignity.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.583
Oh, thank you, darling.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.875
But if you think for one second

06:14.959 --> 06:18.291
that I'm gonna break bread with
that malicious, pill-popping shrew,

06:18.375 --> 06:20.250
you're out of your mind.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.041
Hey, Susan. What you doing?

06:46.959 --> 06:49.291
I just dropped my trowel. Thanks.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.125
All righty, then. You have a nice day.

06:54.417 --> 06:55.834
Bye-bye.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.041
Susan?

06:59.125 --> 07:01.542
Ian. What a surprise.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.542
Were you... Were you hiding from me?

07:05.625 --> 07:07.583
A little. I...

07:07.917 --> 07:12.542
Just the last time we saw each other
it was so awkward and complicated.

07:12.625 --> 07:14.166
Water under the bridge.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.500
Besides, this is strictly business.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.917
I'm throwing a party
for an editor friend in from London.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.709
I thought you two should meet.

07:20.792 --> 07:23.041
You can bring a date if you want.

07:23.125 --> 07:26.542
Speaking of which,
how are things with Mike?

07:26.625 --> 07:30.166
Oh, they're moving along.

07:31.458 --> 07:32.959
It's a process.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.875
And the blonde woman
who's been visiting him every day?

07:35.959 --> 07:38.625
- Is she part of the process?
- Edie?

07:38.709 --> 07:42.250
Oh, she's just a neighbour.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.750
She visits Mike
after her hepatitis C treatments.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.166
Oh.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.542
Well, I do hope
you can come to the party

07:50.625 --> 07:52.959
so you can meet my editor friend.

07:53.041 --> 07:56.333
I just...
I just don't think that's a good idea.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.709
Right.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.250
Well, at least I got to see you.

08:02.542 --> 08:03.917
You have...

08:12.875 --> 08:16.000
This is ludicrous.
The Biedermeier armoire.

08:16.083 --> 08:20.333
It's my understanding that your client
doesn't even like antiques.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.375
Totally immaterial. It's a valuable asset.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.875
Fine. Let's discuss
the Kosta Boda vase.

08:26.959 --> 08:30.208
Nope. It's a premarital acquisition.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.709
We can verify that with receipts.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.750
It was a gift to Mr Solis.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.875
Maybe you were sick that day
at law school, Myron,

08:37.959 --> 08:39.709
but it's called community property.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.208
Don't patronise me, Kenny.

08:41.291 --> 08:42.750
We're prepared
to go to the mat on this one.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.250
Oh, enough.
Just give her what she wants.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.500
Look, I'm sick of fighting.
It's just stuff.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.250
I'd like a moment alone with my client.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.458
This has been going on for months.
I'm done.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.834
Draw up the papers. I'll sign whatever.

08:53.917 --> 08:56.750
You're giving me everything I want,
just like that?

08:56.834 --> 08:58.458
Just like that.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.834
We expect to see the paperwork
by the end of business.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.500
How sweet is that?

09:07.542 --> 09:09.583
We nailed their asses.

09:11.166 --> 09:15.125
Mrs Solis, they completely folded.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.625
That's the thing. Carlos doesn't fold.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.500
That son of a bitch is up to something.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.250
Before you come in, cover your eyes.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.458
- Tom!
- Do it.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.917
Okay, now,

09:35.583 --> 09:38.583
when I say open,
don't look with your eyes,

09:38.667 --> 09:41.041
look with your imagination.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.750
Okay.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.625
Okay, open.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.750
- Oh, dear God.
- Damn it, you looked with your eyes.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.125
It's a dump. What were you thinking?

09:52.208 --> 09:54.417
Well, I'll grant you it's a fixer-upper.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.291
It's a burner-downer.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.125
Come on, honey. Go with me.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.834
We can put in booths
with chequered tablecloths.

10:00.917 --> 10:04.458
A jukebox.
A big screen to watch sports on.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.083
How could you not see the potential
in this place?

10:07.166 --> 10:09.041
Well, I just don't.

10:09.125 --> 10:12.625
It's a little... You know
how I feel about this pizza thing.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.917
Well, hopefully it'll grow on you.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.709
Tom, tell me you didn't sign a lease!

10:22.667 --> 10:24.959
There's gonna be a dartboard.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.959
Tom! No!

10:27.041 --> 10:29.667
There were multiple offers.
I had to move fast.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.709
You leased a building
without telling me?

10:31.792 --> 10:33.458
Well, maybe I didn't tell you
because I knew

10:33.542 --> 10:36.917
you'd try and talk me out of
the best opportunity in my life.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.500
Okay. Okay.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.291
Here's what we're going to do.
You said there were multiple offers.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.125
So we can sub-lease.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.917
Now, let's get the hell out of here.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.792
You said you'd support my dream.

10:51.875 --> 10:55.375
My mistake. I assumed
you'd have a dream worth supporting.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.625
- I'm gonna stay here tonight.
- Fine.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.083
Two lemonades for the victors.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.667
We keep playing like this, Bree,
and we are a cinch for the finals.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.375
- Hello, Tish.
- Hello, Rebecca.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.291
Did you see that?
She just deliberately snubbed me.

11:30.375 --> 11:34.083
- Maybe she didn't notice you.
- Rebecca, I just spoke to her.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.500
And call me paranoid,

11:35.583 --> 11:39.375
but Amy Griswald did the same thing
to me on the golf course last week.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.625
What is going on?

11:41.709 --> 11:44.750
- You really don't know?
- No, I have no idea. What?

11:44.834 --> 11:48.417
Tish is very good friends
with Carolyn Bigsby.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.542
- Carolyn knows Tish?
- She knows everyone.

11:51.625 --> 11:54.875
Anyway, Tish won't talk to you
because you married Orson

11:54.959 --> 11:57.834
even after Carolyn told you
that he killed his wife.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.583
That is ridiculous.
Orson did not kill Alma.

12:00.667 --> 12:04.542
And besides, Carolyn just
apologised to me for that yesterday.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.792
Well, maybe that hasn't
gotten back to Tish.

12:06.875 --> 12:10.083
Well, you don't believe
any of that nonsense, do you?

12:11.625 --> 12:13.500
Do you?

12:13.583 --> 12:15.750
Bree, you're the best doubles partner
I've ever had.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.709
Can we talk about this
after the tournament?

12:28.250 --> 12:31.250
Hello. I'd like to make a reservation
for this evening

12:31.333 --> 12:33.792
under the names Hodge and Bigsby.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.333
And we'll be needing a table
in the centre of the room.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.583
Of course, ma'am.

12:38.667 --> 12:42.583
- How long will Daddy be gone?
- Well, that sort of depends on Daddy.

12:42.667 --> 12:46.917
- Are you two mad at each other?
- Yeah, a little.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.709
But that's okay. That's okay.
We still love each other very much.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.041
But just like kids,

12:51.125 --> 12:54.208
sometimes grownups throw tantrums
and need a time-out.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.333
Why can't he take a time-out
in his room?

12:56.417 --> 12:59.083
'Cause he decided to take it
in his pizza place.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.166
No fair. That sounds fun.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.375
Not this pizza place. It's a rat hole.

13:04.458 --> 13:09.333
But once your dad comes to his senses
and stops being petulant,

13:09.417 --> 13:11.667
- he'll come home.
- What's "petulant"?

13:11.750 --> 13:14.792
It means childish, stubborn,

13:14.875 --> 13:18.709
careless with my money
and your futures.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.834
- Huh?
- It's a grown-up word.

13:20.917 --> 13:24.166
And when Daddy comes home,
you'll learn a new one.

13:26.625 --> 13:27.792
"Grovel."

13:29.959 --> 13:33.291
They got in a really big fight.
Daddy's sleeping at the restaurant.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.333
No, no, it's good
that you told me, sweet pea.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.625
You keep those little ears open.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.542
- Okay?
<i>- Okay. Bye, Mom.</i>

13:40.625 --> 13:41.792
Bye.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.583
Oh, hey, that's for me. I'll take that.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.000
Okay.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.500
Well, I'm beat. I'm gonna take a nap.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.166
Hold it. You're a sweaty mess.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.458
So? I was working out.

14:07.542 --> 14:11.458
So you're not laying on anything
in this house until you take a shower.

14:11.542 --> 14:14.333
Fair enough. It's all yours now, right?

14:38.125 --> 14:40.625
I don't know, Myron,
it's a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.917
Just read it and call me back.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.458
Crap!

15:07.250 --> 15:08.959
What?

15:09.041 --> 15:12.208
Why did you put those shorts back on?

15:12.291 --> 15:14.000
Why do you care?

15:14.083 --> 15:18.125
It's just that they're filthy,
and I was gonna wash them for you.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.500
- You wanna wash my shorts?
- I don't want to,

15:21.583 --> 15:25.375
but if you wear them one more time,
they're gonna ask me themselves.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.834
Wait a minute.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.291
I forgot something in the pocket.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.792
No bleach.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.166
Got it.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.542
<i>So, it's a job contract?</i>

15:49.625 --> 15:50.834
<i>At Welch and Simon.</i>

15:50.917 --> 15:53.792
<i>They're offering him $2 million</i>
<i>over three years plus stock options.</i>

15:53.875 --> 15:55.458
Well, that's fantastic.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.875
- I get half, right?
<i>- Hell, no.</i>

15:57.959 --> 16:00.333
If you're legally divorced
when he signs the contract,

16:00.417 --> 16:02.000
then you don't see a dime.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.792
That conniving, underhanded snake.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.500
Thank God I broke into his desk.

16:06.583 --> 16:10.917
At least now we know why he was
so quick to fold on your settlement.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.083
All right, well, let's just say something
happened to postpone the divorce.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.208
I would still get my share
of that $2 million, right?

16:16.291 --> 16:17.834
<i>Well, in theory.</i>

16:17.917 --> 16:20.667
But how would you manage that?

16:20.750 --> 16:24.500
I know how Carlos thinks.
More importantly, what he thinks with.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.375
- Was that Susan Mayer?
- Yeah, why?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.834
Mr Delfino asked not to be disturbed.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.834
Mike, it's me.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.125
Are you decent?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.542
- Hey, Susan.
- Hey, you.

17:12.542 --> 17:13.959
What you doing?

17:14.041 --> 17:16.667
I suckered McCluskey
into taking the kids for a while

17:16.750 --> 17:20.667
so I could kick back
and catch up with my old friend,

17:20.750 --> 17:22.875
margarita.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.500
- You care to join us?
- Believe me, I would love to.

17:25.583 --> 17:29.375
But I gotta get dinner started for Julie.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.959
Okay.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.417
Oh, you know, what the hell. She's 16.

17:37.500 --> 17:41.208
If she hasn't figured out
how to feed herself by now, I've failed.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.375
That's nice.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.208
So, where were we?

17:51.291 --> 17:54.792
You were trying to figure out
how to kill Edie without doing time.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.417
Oh, right.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.709
I wish Paul Young was still around.
He'd know what to do.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.125
Fine, Gabby, don't say hi.

18:06.417 --> 18:10.583
- Hey. Cocktails? Nobody called me?
- It was spur of the moment.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.166
We're numbing the pain
of our miserable lives.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.792
Oh. Well, I was
trying to do that with exercise,

18:15.875 --> 18:18.500
but why risk a heart attack?

18:18.583 --> 18:20.458
Make mine a double.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.792
I don't recognise her.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.250
Who is she?

18:27.166 --> 18:28.709
That's what we're trying to figure out.

18:28.792 --> 18:31.917
Your phone number
was written on her hand.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.375
I'm sorry I can't help you.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.792
He's had a bit of memory loss.

18:36.875 --> 18:40.208
After 2004, things are fuzzy.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.375
No memory, huh?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.250
That's convenient.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.542
Well, thank you for your time,
Mr Delfino.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.083
You killed a cop once, didn't you?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.709
That was self-defence.

18:57.792 --> 19:00.500
I hope it wasn't just beginner's luck.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.834
You want to charge me with something,
go ahead.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.458
Otherwise, get the hell out of my room!

19:08.959 --> 19:12.291
Were you always this angry,
Mr Delfino?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.500
Or can't you remember?

19:28.375 --> 19:31.792
So, do you sell by the slice
or do I gotta buy a whole pie?

19:33.166 --> 19:36.041
- What are you doing here?
- I knew how hard you were working.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.333
So I figured I'd bring you
a little something to eat

19:42.000 --> 19:43.375
and drink.

19:45.959 --> 19:48.166
You know, I can't pronounce this wine,

19:48.250 --> 19:51.542
which means
it's either really expensive

19:51.625 --> 19:54.000
or I have had too much.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.542
I can't believe that Lynette
doesn't just love this place.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.750
If you ask me,

20:01.125 --> 20:03.709
- she's just a negative Nelly.
- She's just being realistic.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.750
I mean, the restaurant business
is brutal. It's...

20:05.834 --> 20:11.375
Tom. Listen to me, okay?
'Cause I'm a very intuitive person.

20:11.458 --> 20:15.875
Hey, you have a real aura
of success about you.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.333
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

20:23.208 --> 20:27.041
I believe in you, Tom Scavo.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.709
Thank you.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.458
Hey. What just happened?

20:34.542 --> 20:36.542
- We kissed.
- No, you kissed me.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.834
- Now, you know you wanted me to.
- No, no, no, no, no, I didn't.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.834
Really?

20:42.917 --> 20:44.417
'Cause this is you.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.375
"My wife doesn't get me.
Hey, let's have some more wine.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.583
"Alone, in a deserted building."

20:49.667 --> 20:52.583
I was just looking to vent.
I wasn't looking for anything more.

20:52.667 --> 20:56.041
- Okay, but when opportunity knocks...
- Nora, please!

20:57.709 --> 20:59.375
I love my wife.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.166
Really?

21:02.875 --> 21:06.250
You mean the one who thinks
that you're a loser?

21:06.333 --> 21:10.417
No, the one that loves me enough
to keep me from screwing up.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.083
And I think it's about time
I got back home to her.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.625
You led me on.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.250
You shouldn't have done that.

21:29.709 --> 21:33.291
I'm just gonna say it.
Tequila makes me happy.

21:34.834 --> 21:38.166
Yeah, we're drinking on the porch.
You got a problem with that?

21:38.250 --> 21:41.375
Oh, I know them. They live on Cypress.

21:41.458 --> 21:44.917
They just celebrated
their 53rd wedding anniversary.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.500
- Show-offs.
- Don't worry. It won't last.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.834
You're just fooling yourselves!

21:49.917 --> 21:51.458
Hey, I know them.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.834
Oh, 53 years.

21:53.917 --> 21:57.291
- What do you think their secret is?
- I'll take a wild guess.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.709
The man never opened a pizza place.

21:59.792 --> 22:02.333
Oh, I just thought of something.

22:02.417 --> 22:06.166
I'm never gonna celebrate
a 53rd wedding anniversary.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.542
I'd have to live into my 90s.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.166
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.792
Bite on this.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.542
Can I tell you guys something?

22:18.625 --> 22:20.500
Something that I can
only tell you guys?

22:20.583 --> 22:24.125
Oh, God, here she goes again.
What grade is he in?

22:24.208 --> 22:27.166
Not what I was gonna say.
What I was gonna say

22:27.250 --> 22:30.417
is with all his conniving and trickery,

22:30.500 --> 22:32.166
I still love Carlos.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.875
Yeah, he's hot.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.834
Anyway,

22:37.917 --> 22:41.125
what if I never find that passion
with anybody else?

22:41.208 --> 22:45.542
Well, maybe you should try
to patch things up with him.

22:45.625 --> 22:49.542
Nah. I already paid a lawyer.
I'm taking him down.

22:49.625 --> 22:50.750
I brought this on myself.

22:50.834 --> 22:53.041
I tell Tom,
"I want you to be your own man."

22:53.125 --> 22:55.750
But the truth is, I don't.

22:55.834 --> 23:00.625
I want him to have what he wants
if it's what I want.

23:02.667 --> 23:05.250
I'm a bitch with a capital "C."

23:05.333 --> 23:08.792
No! No, you're not. You're a great wife.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.542
And a great mother.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.959
Although, don't you have children?

23:16.041 --> 23:18.000
I had passion with Mike.

23:19.667 --> 23:23.583
And drama. Lots of drama.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.083
Love isn't supposed to be that hard.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.709
Oh. Oh, sweetie.

23:30.250 --> 23:34.333
But, you know, with Ian
everything was always easy.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.125
You know, that's the kind of guy

23:36.208 --> 23:39.041
I could see myself
living into my 90s with.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.041
So go to Ian!

23:41.125 --> 23:44.083
Tell him you made the wrong choice,
and he's the one you want to be with.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.208
What have you got to lose?

23:46.291 --> 23:47.959
Excuse me, ladies?

23:49.250 --> 23:51.792
Look, Susan, God called you a cab.

23:51.875 --> 23:56.333
I'm looking for 4347. Ida Greenberg?

24:02.792 --> 24:04.500
I'm Ida Greenberg.

24:05.291 --> 24:06.875
Yeah, you are.

24:06.959 --> 24:09.083
- See you later.
- Go, Ida!

24:09.166 --> 24:10.750
Go, Ida!

24:30.792 --> 24:32.333
Susan.

24:32.417 --> 24:35.542
- You came.
- Of course I came.

24:37.583 --> 24:41.625
Oh, I just love your house.
It always smells like you.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.875
Oh, my gosh.

24:43.959 --> 24:46.417
It's the thing? Is that tonight?

24:46.500 --> 24:49.291
- Well, yes. Isn't that why you're here?
- No.

24:49.375 --> 24:53.834
No, no. Actually, I just...
I just had something to tell you.

24:53.917 --> 24:55.208
Well, of course.

24:55.291 --> 24:58.083
Doug, see if you can find Judith for me.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.417
Thank you.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.542
Well, as long as you're here,

25:01.625 --> 25:03.709
I want you to meet that editor
I was telling you about.

25:03.792 --> 25:08.125
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea
'cause I didn't really bring my A-game.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.667
Is it hot?

25:10.291 --> 25:11.959
Are you sloshed?

25:13.166 --> 25:15.458
- Susan!
- Oh.

25:15.542 --> 25:18.041
Is this the Susan
you've been telling us all about?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.000
Yes. This is she.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.166
- Could you give us a moment?
- Oh, of course.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.709
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

25:29.792 --> 25:31.875
I just had a few drinks
with my girlfriends,

25:31.959 --> 25:35.583
and thank God, because it gave me
the courage to come over here

25:35.667 --> 25:38.208
and tell you what's really in my heart.

25:40.125 --> 25:41.458
Go on.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.000
But first I think I should use
the powder room.

25:46.083 --> 25:49.041
Of course. It's... It's over there.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.250
She seems nice, Ian.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.834
Oh, yes. She's...
She's absolutely delightful.

26:08.750 --> 26:12.333
Oh, I'm so sorry
that you had to see that.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.458
I see you've met Judith.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.750
So with 100 bucks riding on it,
the pressure's on me now.

26:23.834 --> 26:29.709
I reach into my bag, I grab my four iron,
and bada-bing, hole in one.

26:29.792 --> 26:33.083
And there's been no living with him
ever since.

26:33.166 --> 26:35.792
Did I not tell you how hilarious
these two are together?

26:35.875 --> 26:39.208
Oh, they are a regular barrel of... Tish!

26:39.291 --> 26:41.959
Why, hello, Bree. Carolyn.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.667
Oh, do you two know each other?

26:44.750 --> 26:47.041
Well, that saves me an introduction.

26:47.125 --> 26:50.750
Tish, you know, I was wondering if you
need any help with the Christmas gala.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.834
Last year I was on
the decorations committee.

26:52.917 --> 26:56.542
Oh, my God, I forgot to call you.
What an idiot.

26:56.625 --> 26:59.667
- We'll talk first thing tomorrow.
- That would be lovely. Thanks.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.291
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to be seen.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.208
Well, I need to powder my nose.
Care to join me?

27:07.291 --> 27:08.750
Oh, I'd love to.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.834
- I'm so happy we did this.
- Yes, me, too.

27:13.917 --> 27:17.125
- It's been a delightful evening.
- So, so fun.

27:17.709 --> 27:21.417
Could you get us some extra tissues?
Thank you.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.458
You know, I realised something
just the other day.

27:25.542 --> 27:28.959
You've never seen a picture of Alma,
have you?

27:29.041 --> 27:30.500
No. Why?

27:41.834 --> 27:44.083
Granted, it's not her best look.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.667
What is all this?

27:48.750 --> 27:52.625
That's the police report
that Alma filed after Orson hit her.

27:53.542 --> 27:57.792
It's all in there, the bruises,
contusions, the broken wrist.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.041
This is not possible.

28:01.458 --> 28:03.917
Photos don't lie, Bree.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.250
- Is this why you apologised?
- Yes.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.000
I wanted you to spend time with me

28:09.083 --> 28:13.333
so you can see
I'm not some crazy nut out to get you.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.250
I'm sorry, but if something like that
happened again,

28:15.333 --> 28:17.500
I could never forgive myself.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.583
Thank you.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.125
I had a feeling you might need these.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.667
Bring me another one.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.667
Hey, buddy.

28:33.750 --> 28:36.583
You want to slow it down
a little bit, huh?

28:37.625 --> 28:41.041
- Harvey?
- Look, I'm going through something.

28:41.125 --> 28:44.417
And I don't have anyone else
to talk to about it.

28:45.709 --> 28:47.375
I had an affair.

28:49.458 --> 28:52.291
- Does Carolyn know?
- She has no idea.

28:52.375 --> 28:57.542
I met this girl on a flight from Paris,
and we just connected.

28:57.625 --> 29:02.125
I know it sounds crazy,
but it was love at first sight.

29:03.125 --> 29:06.000
- Are you still seeing her?
- No, that's the thing.

29:06.083 --> 29:08.709
A few months ago
she stopped returning my calls.

29:08.792 --> 29:11.750
And then I went by her place,
and I've looked for her everywhere,

29:11.834 --> 29:14.709
and she's just disappeared.

29:15.583 --> 29:18.458
No, I'll tell you, now I know
what you went through with Alma.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.375
It's brutal.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.834
It gets better, trust me.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.583
I just can't get past it.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.542
I can't get Monique out of my mind.

29:27.625 --> 29:31.166
- Monique?
- That's her name.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.875
Monique Polier.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.667
Isn't she beautiful?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.083
She's very pretty.

29:49.583 --> 29:50.875
They're back.

29:50.959 --> 29:54.458
Wow. You two girls
were gone a long time.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.125
- Everything okay?
- Absolutely.

29:58.667 --> 30:01.709
So, who wants dessert?

30:13.667 --> 30:15.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.125
- What have you been up to?
- Oh.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.083
Just a quiet night with the girls.

30:27.667 --> 30:31.709
Listen, something happened tonight,
and it got me thinking, and...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.542
You mean more to me
than any restaurant ever could.

30:36.625 --> 30:40.208
Oh, stop right there.
I am the one who should apologise.

30:40.291 --> 30:43.625
- I have been a bad wife.
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.166
You were just trying to keep me
from doing something reckless.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.125
Yeah, well, any wife can support
a husband who never takes risks.

30:49.208 --> 30:50.458
And I don't want that kind of husband.

30:50.542 --> 30:52.959
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna be that kind of wife.

30:53.041 --> 30:56.667
So you open your pizza place.

30:56.750 --> 30:59.542
And we will find a way to make it work.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.709
You don't know how much
it means to me to hear that.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.834
I love you!

31:10.917 --> 31:13.166
So, what happened tonight?

31:13.834 --> 31:16.750
Okay, but don't react
until I've told you the whole story.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.750
And remember,
it's actually a good thing,

31:18.834 --> 31:21.000
because it brought us back together.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.083
Ding-dong.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.959
I don't know what Tom told you,
but he came on to me.

31:33.041 --> 31:36.291
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

31:36.375 --> 31:39.792
Why don't you just come on over here
and say that to me again?

31:39.875 --> 31:41.000
Stay away from me.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.625
I have been trying
to stay away from you.

31:42.709 --> 31:43.959
Mom?

31:50.583 --> 31:52.000
Everything's all right.

31:52.083 --> 31:55.291
So you can just go back
into your room and play.

31:55.375 --> 31:58.709
Kayla, don't move.

32:07.208 --> 32:09.750
Okay. Never mind.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.500
I'm leaving.

32:16.041 --> 32:19.125
First, I'm just gonna give
your mom a hug.

32:19.208 --> 32:22.041
Your association with my family is over.

32:22.125 --> 32:24.875
When Kayla comes to visit, you
will drop her at the end of the block.

32:24.959 --> 32:26.917
You will never again see my husband.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.500
And if you try to, I will do to your spine

32:30.583 --> 32:34.166
what I just did to your front door.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.417
Nod if you understand.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.834
And you, I'm gonna see you
on Saturday, right?

32:48.917 --> 32:50.917
Don't forget your swimsuit.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.792
Good morning!

33:03.875 --> 33:07.333
You're looking bright-eyed and bushy.

33:09.792 --> 33:13.125
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah, I slept on the sofa.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.542
When I brought you home
you were still, as you Americans say,

33:16.625 --> 33:18.041
tossing your tacos.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.125
Oh, please.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.500
Keep the food references
to a minimum.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.291
Bless you.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.583
So, what else happened?

33:33.667 --> 33:35.542
You don't remember?

33:35.625 --> 33:38.291
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'll repeat what you said last night,

33:38.375 --> 33:42.959
and you say whether it was you
or the booze talking. Are you ready?

33:43.041 --> 33:46.667
You said you missed me.
Susan or booze?

33:46.750 --> 33:47.834
Susan.

33:47.917 --> 33:50.333
You said it was a mistake
breaking up with me

33:50.417 --> 33:55.291
and that you wanted to start again.
Susan or booze?

33:55.375 --> 33:56.625
Susan.

33:56.709 --> 34:00.959
Then you said that you wanted to
dress me up like a schoolboy

34:01.041 --> 34:03.917
and spank my naughty bottom.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.667
Susan or booze?

34:09.542 --> 34:11.375
I didn't say that!

34:12.417 --> 34:17.500
Yeah, all right, then. But if you had,
Susan or booze?

34:20.750 --> 34:23.875
A little of both, so Booze-an.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.208
Detective Ridley.

34:48.291 --> 34:52.667
<i>Your Jane Doe in the morgue</i>
<i>is named Monique Polier.</i>

34:52.750 --> 34:54.959
- Who's this?
<i>- Just before she died,</i>

34:55.041 --> 34:58.542
<i>she was having an affair</i>
<i>with a man named Harvey Bigsby.</i>

34:58.625 --> 35:00.166
<i>- You got that?</i>
- Yeah.

35:00.250 --> 35:03.875
Can I get your name?
I'll need to bring you in for a statement.

35:17.166 --> 35:21.166
- Carlos, could you come help me?
- I'm watching the game.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.875
It'll just take a second. Please.

35:29.959 --> 35:32.250
What, Gabby?

35:32.333 --> 35:33.500
Whoa.

35:34.709 --> 35:38.333
- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.125
I'm gonna go meet
some new friends for dinner.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.583
But my zipper's stuck.
Can you help me?

35:49.375 --> 35:51.750
Man, this is really stuck.

35:51.834 --> 35:55.000
It's like somebody
put Super Glue on it or something.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.041
Weird.

35:57.583 --> 36:01.792
Well, you know what, I don't want
to be late, so I should probably change.

36:02.667 --> 36:03.792
Wow.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.166
Oh, Carlos, this old thing.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.208
You've seen it all before.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.208
I'm just gonna wear
the little blue number.

36:12.291 --> 36:14.417
Will you hand me those stockings?

36:16.083 --> 36:18.917
Oh, I've got a raggedy nail.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.208
You're gonna have to help me
put those on.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.583
Are you sure about that?

36:28.667 --> 36:32.041
Well, I'd do it myself,
but I don't want to get a snag.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.375
It's been a long time.

36:43.458 --> 36:46.542
Really? It seems like yesterday to me.

36:52.875 --> 36:56.750
- You want me to help you hook that?
- Sure.

36:56.834 --> 37:00.000
Why not, for old times' sake?

37:13.834 --> 37:15.709
What about your new friends?

37:16.834 --> 37:19.625
I decided I'd rather catch up
with an old one.

37:45.709 --> 37:49.083
Mr Bigsby, Detective Ridley, homicide.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.959
I understand you know her.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.250
All right, yes,
we were sleeping together.

38:08.709 --> 38:11.667
- Can we do this somewhere else?
- Sure.

38:19.875 --> 38:23.083
Carlos, you think
we're making a mistake?

38:23.166 --> 38:26.458
- What do you mean?
- The whole divorce thing.

38:26.542 --> 38:28.875
Maybe we shouldn't go through with it.

38:28.959 --> 38:33.000
It's not like we're gonna find
this kind of passion with anyone else.

38:35.458 --> 38:37.625
Are you saying
you want to stay together?

38:37.709 --> 38:39.542
Yeah.

38:39.625 --> 38:41.375
Yeah, I guess I am.

38:41.458 --> 38:44.542
Why don't we just put all of this
behind us and stay together?

38:44.625 --> 38:47.208
- What do you say?
- Oh, baby.

38:47.291 --> 38:50.625
If you knew how long
I've waited to hear you say...

38:56.458 --> 38:58.500
What? What's so funny?

38:58.583 --> 39:00.291
Oh, man.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.750
I thought I'd be able to
get through this without cracking up,

39:02.834 --> 39:05.083
but you are just too funny.

39:09.125 --> 39:12.834
There's a little something
that I need to own up to.

39:12.917 --> 39:15.625
I know that the only reason
you slept with me

39:15.709 --> 39:17.834
was because I got a new job.

39:17.917 --> 39:21.542
You got a new job?
Honey, that's wonderful!

39:21.625 --> 39:25.542
Gabby, please. You're a model.
Not a model/actress.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.417
There is no job.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.959
The contracts in my desk are fake.
I mailed them to myself.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.834
What?

39:34.667 --> 39:36.834
Why would you do that?

39:36.917 --> 39:39.291
Well, let's see.

39:42.083 --> 39:46.875
- You did this just to get me in bed?
- No.

39:46.959 --> 39:50.750
I did it because I knew you'd
smell money and come crawling back.

39:50.834 --> 39:53.583
Then I could turn you down
and walk out on my own terms.

39:53.667 --> 39:54.834
Your terms?

39:54.917 --> 39:56.792
You don't get to screw around on me,

39:56.875 --> 40:00.166
take my money,
and then walk away without a scratch.

40:00.250 --> 40:01.667
I want you hurting, baby.

40:01.750 --> 40:03.750
And judging by the look on your face,

40:03.834 --> 40:07.291
when you saw 2 million
imaginary dollars disappear,

40:07.375 --> 40:09.500
I succeeded.

40:09.583 --> 40:13.500
- You are a bastard!
- Better a bastard than a whore.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.917
Oh, God!

40:25.750 --> 40:29.000
Hello? There's been an accident.
My husband, he...

40:34.542 --> 40:36.709
I'm gonna have to call you back.

40:40.375 --> 40:41.667
Carlos?

40:43.458 --> 40:44.750
Honey?

40:47.041 --> 40:48.500
Carlos?

40:53.458 --> 40:54.667
Oh, yeah.

40:56.542 --> 40:58.000
It's on.

41:04.875 --> 41:07.250
<i>There's a place in St Timothy's Church</i>

41:07.333 --> 41:10.792
<i>where sinners go to confess their sins.</i>

41:10.875 --> 41:15.125
<i>And once they're done,</i>
<i>they expect absolution.</i>

41:15.208 --> 41:21.083
<i>But the truth is not all confessions</i>
<i>are worthy of such forgiveness.</i>

41:21.166 --> 41:23.542
<i>Most who unveil hidden agendas</i>

41:23.625 --> 41:26.375
<i>deserve the condemnation</i>
<i>they receive.</i>

41:27.834 --> 41:33.417
<i>Most who disclose vengeful motives</i>
<i>merit the punishment that follows.</i>

41:34.125 --> 41:36.333
<i>Only the truly repentant</i>

41:36.417 --> 41:40.417
<i>have any right at all</i>
<i>to expect a second chance.</i>

41:42.542 --> 41:44.834
Come on, what's my surprise?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.333
I thought you'd never get here.

42:02.625 --> 42:07.208
<i>Which is why it's best to think twice</i>
<i>before you confess.</i>

42:07.291 --> 42:08.500
Mike?

42:09.709 --> 42:11.208
What's wrong?

42:13.208 --> 42:16.333
The... The girl who died.

42:16.417 --> 42:21.875
<i>Especially if you don't know</i>
<i>what it is you're confessing to.</i>

42:21.959 --> 42:23.792
I think I knew her.
