00:07.011 --> 00:08.412
NARRATOR:
In the First World War

00:08.412 --> 00:10.414
and for the first time
in the history of man,

00:10.414 --> 00:13.517
nations combined
to fight against nations,

00:13.517 --> 00:15.987
using the crude weapons
of those days.

00:15.987 --> 00:17.421
The Second World War

00:17.421 --> 00:19.623
involved every continent
on the globe,

00:19.623 --> 00:23.294
and men turned to science
for new devices of warfare,

00:23.294 --> 00:25.063
which reached
an unparalleled peak

00:25.063 --> 00:26.764
in their capacity
for destruction.

00:26.764 --> 00:28.366
And now,

00:28.366 --> 00:30.701
fought with the terrible
weapons of superscience,

00:30.701 --> 00:34.138
menacing all mankind
and every creature on Earth,

00:34.138 --> 00:35.639
comes...

00:35.639 --> 00:37.541
The War of the Worlds.

00:42.413 --> 00:45.616
( stirring, adventurous theme
playing )

01:41.939 --> 01:43.774
No one would have believed

01:43.774 --> 01:45.709
in the middle
of the 20th century

01:45.709 --> 01:48.846
that human affairs were being
watched keenly and closely

01:48.846 --> 01:51.349
by intelligences
greater than man's.

01:51.349 --> 01:55.919
Yet across the gulf of space,
on the planet Mars,

01:55.919 --> 01:59.490
intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic

01:59.490 --> 02:02.360
regarded our Earth
with envious eyes,

02:02.360 --> 02:06.830
slowly and surely
drawing their plans against us.

02:06.830 --> 02:10.834
Mars is more than
140 million miles from the sun,

02:10.834 --> 02:12.236
and for centuries

02:12.236 --> 02:15.406
it has been in the last stages
of exhaustion.

02:15.406 --> 02:19.310
At night, temperatures drop
far below zero,

02:19.310 --> 02:21.079
even at its equator.

02:21.079 --> 02:23.347
The inhabitants
of this dying planet

02:23.347 --> 02:24.715
looked across space

02:24.715 --> 02:26.384
with instruments
and intelligences

02:26.384 --> 02:28.952
of which
we have scarcely dreamed,

02:28.952 --> 02:33.457
searching for another world
to which they could migrate.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.860
They could not go to Pluto,
outermost of all planets,

02:36.860 --> 02:42.500
and so cold that its atmosphere
lies frozen on its surface.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.002
They couldn't go
to Neptune or Uranus,

02:45.002 --> 02:48.972
twin worlds in eternal night
and perpetual cold,

02:48.972 --> 02:52.243
both surrounded
by an unbreathable atmosphere

02:52.243 --> 02:54.745
of methane gas
and ammonia vapor.

02:54.745 --> 02:56.147
( wind gusting )

02:56.147 --> 02:59.650
The Martians considered Saturn,
an attractive world,

02:59.650 --> 03:03.487
with its many moons
and beautiful rings
of cosmic dust.

03:03.487 --> 03:08.592
But its temperature is close
to 270 degrees below zero,

03:08.592 --> 03:13.731
and ice lies 15,000 miles deep
on its surface.

03:13.731 --> 03:16.434
Their nearest world
was giant Jupiter,

03:16.434 --> 03:19.437
where there are titanic cliffs
of lava and ice

03:19.437 --> 03:21.839
with hydrogen flaming
at the tops,

03:21.839 --> 03:24.608
where the atmospheric pressure
is terrible,

03:24.608 --> 03:27.811
thousands of pounds
to the square-inch.

03:27.811 --> 03:29.613
They couldn't go there.

03:29.613 --> 03:33.317
Nor could they go to Mercury,
nearest planet to the sun.

03:33.317 --> 03:34.718
It has no air,

03:34.718 --> 03:36.987
and the temperature
at its equator

03:36.987 --> 03:39.990
is that of molten lead.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.559
Of all the worlds

03:41.559 --> 03:45.896
that the intelligences on Mars
could see and study,

03:45.896 --> 03:48.366
only our own warm Earth

03:48.366 --> 03:52.336
was green with vegetation,
bright with water

03:52.336 --> 03:55.406
and possessed
a cloudy atmosphere

03:55.406 --> 03:58.209
eloquent of fertility.

03:58.209 --> 03:59.910
It did not occur to mankind

03:59.910 --> 04:02.880
that a swift fate
might be hanging over us

04:02.880 --> 04:05.916
or that from the blackness
of outer space

04:05.916 --> 04:09.253
we were being scrutinized
and studied,

04:09.253 --> 04:13.857
until the time of our nearest
approach to the orbit of Mars

04:13.857 --> 04:15.759
during a pleasant
summer season...

04:15.759 --> 04:17.795
( whooshing )

04:24.302 --> 04:26.904
( bustle & chatter )

04:29.173 --> 04:30.774
MAN:
Is that a fireball or something?

04:30.774 --> 04:32.009
Boy, that's big!

04:32.009 --> 04:34.312
Maybe it's
a comet.

04:35.246 --> 04:36.580
( explosion )

04:36.580 --> 04:39.082
Boy, that had me scared.
Wonder where it lit.

04:39.082 --> 04:41.385
Miles away, I'll bet you.
Hey, let's go find it.

04:41.385 --> 04:43.120
That probably dropped
halfway to Pomona.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.355
Oh, it was nearer
than that.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.490
I'm gonna see.
Who's coming?

04:46.490 --> 04:49.693
This is Pine Summit.
I got a smoke.

04:49.693 --> 04:50.761
One-sixty, 30.

04:50.761 --> 04:54.798
Azimuth reading:
160 degrees, 30 minutes.

04:54.798 --> 04:56.467
Big?

04:56.467 --> 05:00.371
I'll bet it's as big
as anything that ever
lit in California.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.805
You better get something
over there.

05:01.805 --> 05:03.607
It's started
a blaze already.

05:03.607 --> 05:06.810
( thrilling violin theme
playing )

05:06.810 --> 05:09.480
( siren wailing)

05:09.480 --> 05:10.714
MAN 1:
Over here, man!

05:10.714 --> 05:12.182
MAN 2:
It's burning this way.

05:12.182 --> 05:14.117
MAN 3:
You there,
with the shovel!

05:14.117 --> 05:15.919
MAN 4:
Quick! Fire over there!

05:15.919 --> 05:18.589
MAN 1:
All right. Come over here
and give us a hand!

05:18.589 --> 05:20.224
MAN 2:
Anyone have a flashlight?

05:20.224 --> 05:22.926
( tense theme playing )

05:22.926 --> 05:24.595
Quick!
Come on over here!

05:26.464 --> 05:28.632
MAN 3:
Let me get in there!

05:28.632 --> 05:30.368
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

05:30.368 --> 05:32.169
MAN 4:
Which way are
you going? Left?

05:32.169 --> 05:34.572
MAN 3:
Bring that hose over here.

05:34.572 --> 05:36.774
MAN 1:
We're getting it
licked, fellas.

05:36.774 --> 05:38.008
Keep at it.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.943
MAN 2:
Hey, grab this!

05:39.943 --> 05:43.581
MAN 3:
Joe! Joe! Lend
a hand over here!

05:43.581 --> 05:46.884
Number three to D.O.
Number three to D.O.

05:46.884 --> 05:48.786
MAN:
D.O. to number
three. Come in.

05:48.786 --> 05:50.321
We're getting this
under control.

05:50.321 --> 05:52.155
We won't need
any more help. Over.

05:52.155 --> 05:53.924
Okay. Send
the tanker in,

05:53.924 --> 05:57.528
but you can stand by until
that thing cools off. Over.

05:57.528 --> 05:59.730
I think somebody ought
to check on it. Over.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.232
Well, there's some fellas
fishing at Pine Summit.

06:02.232 --> 06:05.469
I think they're scientists.
They probably saw it come down.

06:05.469 --> 06:07.638
I'll let them know.
What's it look like?

06:07.638 --> 06:10.508
Can't get near enough
to see it very well.

06:10.508 --> 06:13.877
It's too hot.
But it's a whale of a size.

06:16.414 --> 06:18.516
( high-pitched drone )

06:22.286 --> 06:24.988
I got a message
for you.

06:24.988 --> 06:27.157
You're the guys
from Pacific Tech, ain't you?

06:27.157 --> 06:29.560
Right.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.261
Looks like the fishing
was good.

06:31.261 --> 06:33.163
Have some?

06:33.163 --> 06:35.833
Well, I might
just do that.

06:37.535 --> 06:40.003
It's about that meteor.

06:41.204 --> 06:43.674
They say it's a whopper.

06:45.709 --> 06:46.944
The district officer phoned us

06:46.944 --> 06:48.746
at the lookout
up on the summit.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.147
I thought you might
be interested.

06:50.147 --> 06:51.882
It's about ten or 12 miles
from here,

06:51.882 --> 06:53.083
over by Linda Rosa.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.352
Are they sure it's a meteor?

06:54.352 --> 06:56.019
It didn't come down like one.

06:56.019 --> 06:57.355
That's right.

06:57.355 --> 07:00.524
Came down in kind of
spurts, didn't it?

07:00.524 --> 07:02.259
Well, you fellas will have
to figure it out.

07:02.259 --> 07:03.761
You're scientists.

07:03.761 --> 07:05.963
All I know is,
they say it's as big as a house

07:05.963 --> 07:06.964
and practically red-hot.

07:06.964 --> 07:08.732
I'd like to borrow
your car

07:08.732 --> 07:10.233
and take a look at it
in the morning.

07:10.233 --> 07:11.469
Well, we ought
to get back.

07:11.469 --> 07:13.571
I can fly Bilderbeck down
in your plane.

07:13.571 --> 07:16.206
Okay. The insurance
is paid up.

07:16.206 --> 07:18.041
Light?

07:18.041 --> 07:19.443
No, I'll smoke it later.

07:19.443 --> 07:21.211
( laughs )

07:21.211 --> 07:24.648
( distant murmuring )

07:24.648 --> 07:27.685
( slow, suspenseful theme
playing )

07:35.292 --> 07:36.627
Did you watch it
come down?

07:36.627 --> 07:37.895
I seen it
from our window.

07:37.895 --> 07:39.563
WOMAN:
Not just from the window.

07:39.563 --> 07:41.532
The whole house
lit right up.

07:41.532 --> 07:43.701
Harold. Harold.
Look here a minute.

07:43.701 --> 07:45.235
And step over
to your left,

07:45.235 --> 07:47.037
just a little.
And hold it.

07:47.037 --> 07:48.238
Smile.

07:48.238 --> 07:49.907
It must've hit
way up there

07:49.907 --> 07:51.442
and then skidded
along the gully.

07:51.442 --> 07:52.876
After it stopped,

07:52.876 --> 07:54.812
all that loose earth
and stuff shook down over it.

07:54.812 --> 07:57.180
Excuse me.
I guess most of it's buried.

07:57.180 --> 07:59.683
That's 12 feet thick,
easy. Maybe more.

07:59.683 --> 08:01.351
Meteors always
run heavy.

08:01.351 --> 08:05.122
They won't be able to haul
this one away to no museum.

08:05.122 --> 08:07.991
It'll be a real good attraction
for Sunday drivers.

08:07.991 --> 08:10.794
Better than a lion farm
or a snake pit.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.329
We won't have to feed it.

08:12.329 --> 08:13.997
Sure. We can sell
the tamales

08:13.997 --> 08:15.666
and the enchiladas
and the hot dogs too.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.568
Yeah! Ice cream,
cold drinks, souvenirs.

08:17.568 --> 08:19.870
I think we should put up
a few picnic tables.

08:19.870 --> 08:22.640
No, no. Then they'd bring
their own lunches.

08:23.741 --> 08:25.342
What's the idea,
Buck?

08:25.342 --> 08:26.844
Gonna dig for gold?

08:26.844 --> 08:28.612
You think you're
kidding?

08:28.612 --> 08:32.015
It's gonna be like
having a gold mine
in our own backyard.

08:32.015 --> 08:33.283
( all laughing )

08:33.283 --> 08:35.118
I'm gonna get
a closer look at it.

08:35.118 --> 08:36.854
Yes.

08:41.124 --> 08:43.393
MAN 1:
Reckon this is solid
all through here?

08:43.393 --> 08:45.996
MAN 2:
Lucky it didn't come down
in the middle of town.

08:45.996 --> 08:47.965
MAN 3:
I wonder who owns
this property.

08:47.965 --> 08:50.233
You might be able
to make a dime out of this.

08:50.233 --> 08:52.202
That's it over there.

08:52.202 --> 08:54.772
Feels pretty darn hot!

08:54.772 --> 08:56.574
MAN:
What's the idea
of the shovel?

08:56.574 --> 08:59.076
MAN 2: Be careful, Buck.
MAN 3: Yeah. Watch it, Buck.

08:59.076 --> 09:00.511
MAN 4:
Easy, Buck, man.

09:00.511 --> 09:01.712
Hey!

09:01.712 --> 09:02.980
MAN 5:
That's pretty hot there.

09:02.980 --> 09:05.115
Boy, you can feel
the heat from here.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.617
Did you see it come down?

09:06.617 --> 09:08.385
Yes, I was fishing
up in the hills.

09:08.385 --> 09:10.654
Well, you must've caught
plenty with all that tackle.

09:10.654 --> 09:11.855
Well, there were
three of us.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.657
The others flew back
in my plane.

09:13.657 --> 09:14.992
( shovel clanging )

09:14.992 --> 09:16.927
I don't understand
why a meteor that size

09:16.927 --> 09:18.361
didn't make a bigger crater.

09:18.361 --> 09:20.397
Oh, it hit sideways
and skidded in.

09:20.397 --> 09:23.166
At least that's what I think.
I don't really know.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.069
But the ranger said a scientist
is coming from Pacific Tech.

09:26.069 --> 09:28.939
He'll tell us. Clayton
Forrester. Ever hear of him?

09:28.939 --> 09:31.675
What's that fella trying
to do, dig it out?

09:31.675 --> 09:34.177
He's top man in astro-
and nuclear physics.

09:34.177 --> 09:35.879
He knows all about meteors.

09:36.780 --> 09:38.549
You seem to know all about him.

09:38.549 --> 09:41.351
Well, I did a thesis
on modern scientists,

09:41.351 --> 09:43.120
working for my master's degree.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.688
Did it do you any good?

09:44.688 --> 09:48.659
Why, sure. I got it.

09:48.659 --> 09:49.927
Say, do you have a match?

09:49.927 --> 09:52.930
No, I'm sorry,
I don't smoke.

09:52.930 --> 09:55.465
Forrester's the man
behind the new atomic engines.

09:55.465 --> 09:57.167
They had him on
the cover of Time.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.902
You know, you've got
to rate to get that.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.571
Yeah. He isn't that good.

10:00.571 --> 10:03.607
Well, now, how can you say that
when you don't even know him?

10:03.607 --> 10:05.643
Well, I do know him.
Slightly.

10:05.643 --> 10:07.578
Oh, what's he like?

10:07.578 --> 10:09.680
Well, he's like, uh...

10:09.680 --> 10:13.016
Like, uh...

10:14.251 --> 10:15.786
Oh!

10:15.786 --> 10:17.655
Well, you certainly
don't look like yourself

10:17.655 --> 10:19.122
in that getup, Dr. Forrester.

10:19.122 --> 10:20.858
But I'm happy
to meet you anyway.

10:20.858 --> 10:22.459
I'm Sylvia Van Buren.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.762
I teach Library Science
over at USC.

10:24.762 --> 10:26.196
I didn't know
how to stop you.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.265
Well, I might've recognized you
without the beard.

10:28.265 --> 10:30.801
And you didn't wear glasses
on the Time cover.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.536
Well, they're really
for long distance.

10:32.536 --> 10:36.073
When I want to look
at something close,
I take them off.

10:41.244 --> 10:42.980
( clang )

10:42.980 --> 10:44.447
( hissing )

10:44.447 --> 10:45.883
Come on, get out!
Get up out of there!

10:45.883 --> 10:47.985
( crowd yelling indistinctly )

10:51.188 --> 10:53.957
Boy, you could fry eggs
on that thing!

10:53.957 --> 10:56.760
All that sand will keep
the heat in for a long time.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.396
Oh, Uncle Matthew,
this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.

10:59.396 --> 11:02.800
My uncle, Dr. Matthew Collins,
pastor of the community church.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.135
Well, I... How do you do,
Dr. Forrester?

11:05.135 --> 11:06.436
How do you do, sir?

11:06.436 --> 11:08.706
MAN:
Hey, you!

11:08.706 --> 11:10.674
( device clicking )

11:14.978 --> 11:16.513
What you got in here, fella?

11:16.513 --> 11:19.016
Ticking like a bomb.

11:21.284 --> 11:24.554
This is a Geiger counter
for detecting radioactivity.

11:24.554 --> 11:29.426
We did a little bit of surveying
while we were up in the hills.

11:29.426 --> 11:33.396
( rapid clicking )

11:33.396 --> 11:36.634
( slow clicking )

11:36.634 --> 11:39.202
( rapid clicking )

11:39.202 --> 11:40.570
It's that meteor.

11:40.570 --> 11:42.372
It's radioactive?

11:42.372 --> 11:46.810
Yes. Difficult to account
for a reaction like that.

11:51.314 --> 11:53.851
Look at this thing.
It's going crazy.

11:53.851 --> 11:55.819
Maybe we ought to keep
people away from it, huh?

11:55.819 --> 11:57.087
Might be a good idea.

11:57.087 --> 11:58.756
I'll post two or three
deputies.

11:58.756 --> 12:01.959
They can make sure it doesn't
start any more fires too.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.894
You know, that meteor's
either very light,

12:03.894 --> 12:05.095
which is unheard of,

12:05.095 --> 12:07.497
or else it's hollow somehow.

12:07.497 --> 12:08.966
If it were heavy and solid,

12:08.966 --> 12:12.836
it would have made a tremendous
crater when it landed.

12:12.836 --> 12:15.806
I think I'll wait around
until it cools off.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.440
If you tell me of a place
in town,

12:17.440 --> 12:19.142
I-- I could clean up.

12:19.142 --> 12:22.079
I'd be delighted if you'd stay
at my house, Dr. Forrester.

12:22.079 --> 12:23.413
Thank you.

12:23.413 --> 12:26.884
Probably won't be cool
for another 24 hours.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.786
What do people do
around here on a Saturday?

12:28.786 --> 12:30.353
They don't do much
of anything.

12:30.353 --> 12:32.956
There's a square dance
at the social hall this evening.

12:32.956 --> 12:34.658
( band playing lively
square dance music )

12:34.658 --> 12:37.027
CALLER:
* Allemande left
And the ladies star *

12:37.027 --> 12:38.862
* Gents walk around
But not too far *

12:38.862 --> 12:40.530
* Allemande left
And the gentlemen star *

12:40.530 --> 12:44.001
* Ladies walk around
But not too far *

12:44.001 --> 12:46.770
* First and third
You balance and swing *

12:46.770 --> 12:48.672
* Promenade the outside ring *

12:48.672 --> 12:51.208
* Three-quarter
Round the outside ring *

12:51.208 --> 12:52.943
* Through that couple
And not too far *

12:52.943 --> 12:54.544
* Meet in the center
With a right-hand star *

12:54.544 --> 12:56.446
* Swing your corner
With the left hand round *

12:56.446 --> 12:58.648
* It's once and a half
On the merry-go-round... *

12:58.648 --> 13:00.851
( bird caws )

13:05.288 --> 13:08.959
Well, let's take
another look at it.

13:13.831 --> 13:17.034
( ominous theme playing )

13:35.118 --> 13:36.653
Almost cold now,
ain't it?

13:36.653 --> 13:38.055
It won't start
any more fires.

13:38.055 --> 13:39.289
We might
as well go home.

13:39.289 --> 13:42.192
Yeah, no sense
staying out here.

13:42.192 --> 13:44.161
Let's go.

13:45.362 --> 13:48.265
( grinding & sizzling )

13:48.265 --> 13:49.466
Hey,

13:49.466 --> 13:52.369
it's moving!

13:56.306 --> 14:00.110
( scraping )

14:09.386 --> 14:11.021
It's a bomb.

14:11.021 --> 14:13.156
It don't go off
last night.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.958
Maybe it's gonna
go off now, huh?

14:14.958 --> 14:17.828
It's an enemy sneak attack.
Let's get out of here.

14:17.828 --> 14:19.362
Wait a minute.

14:19.362 --> 14:21.498
Wait a minute.

14:21.498 --> 14:25.302
Bombs don't unscrew.

14:25.302 --> 14:28.806
It's no meteor,
that's for sure.

14:29.907 --> 14:33.076
Darnedest thing
I ever saw...

14:33.076 --> 14:35.045
the way that's
unscrewing.

14:38.916 --> 14:42.019
( laughter & chattering )

14:43.821 --> 14:46.223
Thank you, Dr. Forrester.
You having fun?

14:46.223 --> 14:49.292
Yup. And you want to know
what I was thinking?

14:49.292 --> 14:51.161
If we could gather
all the energy expended

14:51.161 --> 14:52.662
in just one square dance,

14:52.662 --> 14:54.898
we could send that meteor
back to where it came from.

14:54.898 --> 14:56.399
( all laughing )

14:56.399 --> 14:59.069
( hissing )

14:59.069 --> 15:02.339
( high-pitched droning )

15:14.784 --> 15:17.387
( eerie pulsing )

15:43.146 --> 15:45.315
Must be somebody in there.

15:45.315 --> 15:46.449
Who?

15:46.449 --> 15:47.918
Where do you think
they come from?

15:47.918 --> 15:49.352
How would I know?

15:49.352 --> 15:52.289
I read someplace Mars is
near the Earth right now.

15:52.289 --> 15:55.893
Happens every 18,
20 years, they say.

15:55.893 --> 15:58.595
Men from Mars.

15:58.595 --> 16:00.363
What do you think?

16:00.363 --> 16:03.500
Maybe these are not men.
Not like us.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.370
Everything human doesn't have
to look like you and me.

16:11.174 --> 16:13.610
If it's men
from Mars,

16:13.610 --> 16:15.545
we ought to let them know
we're friendly.

16:15.545 --> 16:18.581
Don't fool around with something
when you don't know what it is.

16:18.581 --> 16:21.218
We'd be the first
to make contact with them, see?

16:21.218 --> 16:23.753
We'd be in all
the papers.

16:23.753 --> 16:25.122
How about that?

16:25.122 --> 16:26.556
We could show them
we're friendly, huh?

16:26.556 --> 16:29.226
Uh, walk out there
with a white flag.

16:29.226 --> 16:33.030
Here, I-I've got
an old sugar sack in my car.

16:35.966 --> 16:38.568
( pulsing continues )

16:41.004 --> 16:44.041
What are we going
to say to them?

16:45.508 --> 16:48.545
Welcome to California.

16:48.545 --> 16:51.481
Come on.

16:54.251 --> 16:57.988
( pulsing intensifies )

17:21.044 --> 17:22.479
We're friends!

17:22.479 --> 17:25.115
Yeah!

17:25.115 --> 17:27.050
Hey, there. Open up.

17:27.050 --> 17:29.086
How they gonna
understand us?

17:29.086 --> 17:31.088
We'll talk
in sign language.

17:31.088 --> 17:32.990
They'll understand
us, all right.

17:32.990 --> 17:35.292
Sure. Sure.

17:35.292 --> 17:36.793
Everybody understands

17:36.793 --> 17:39.462
when you wave the white flag,
you want to be friends.

17:39.462 --> 17:40.697
Hey, there.

17:40.697 --> 17:41.898
Open up.

17:41.898 --> 17:43.500
Come on out.
We're friends.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.869
That's right.
We welcome you.

17:46.869 --> 17:48.438
We're friends.
Yeah.

17:48.438 --> 17:51.408
( zapping )

17:51.408 --> 17:52.842
( upbeat folk music playing )

17:52.842 --> 17:54.044
( music stops )

17:54.044 --> 17:55.245
Hey!
The lights!

17:55.245 --> 17:58.215
( crowd yelling indistinctly )

18:01.884 --> 18:03.653
Where's the fuse box?

18:03.653 --> 18:06.723
No smooching in the dark,
folks.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.659
MAN 1:
Any candles around?

18:09.659 --> 18:12.429
Hey, look, look. All the lights
in town have gone out.

18:16.566 --> 18:19.536
MAN 2:
Somebody's found
some candles.

18:19.536 --> 18:22.639
Zippy, call the electric company
and see what happened.

18:22.639 --> 18:24.241
Okay.

18:34.617 --> 18:37.554
ZIPPY:
Hey, the phone's
gone dead!

18:37.554 --> 18:39.156
That's funny.
The phone's

18:39.156 --> 18:41.091
not on the same circuit
as the lights.

18:41.091 --> 18:42.625
What are they saying,
honey?

18:42.625 --> 18:45.662
Something's wrong
with my hearing aid.

18:45.662 --> 18:49.266
Well, we always play
"Good Night, Ladies"
at 12:00 anyway.

18:49.266 --> 18:50.833
It must be nearly that now.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.036
( creeping, ominous theme
playing )

18:53.036 --> 18:54.704
My watch has stopped.

18:54.704 --> 18:57.140
Oh, I've got the time.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.043
Huh, mine's stopped too.

19:00.043 --> 19:01.344
So has mine.

19:01.344 --> 19:03.380
Jeepers, mine ain't working.
What is this?

19:03.380 --> 19:06.183
( all talking at once )

19:07.750 --> 19:10.687
Why, they've all stopped
at the same time.

19:10.687 --> 19:14.224
There's only one explanation
for a thing like this.

19:14.224 --> 19:17.094
Do you have a pin?

19:27.003 --> 19:28.238
WOMAN:
Oh, look!

19:28.238 --> 19:29.639
MAN:
Look!

19:29.639 --> 19:31.208
You see that?

19:31.208 --> 19:32.842
My watch is magnetized.

19:32.842 --> 19:36.513
That's what knocked
the phones out too.

19:36.513 --> 19:38.815
How could it happen to
everybody's watch all together?

19:38.815 --> 19:40.016
Do you have a pocket compass?

19:40.016 --> 19:42.319
Yeah.

19:43.386 --> 19:46.089
( theme intensifying )

19:46.089 --> 19:48.525
Hey, that needle
isn't pointing north.

19:48.525 --> 19:51.027
It's pointing to the gully
where that meteor came down.

19:51.027 --> 19:52.362
( siren blaring )

19:52.362 --> 19:55.465
All right, folks, let me
through. Let me through.

20:05.475 --> 20:06.943
MAN:
Sheriff, what's going on?

20:06.943 --> 20:10.113
I don't know any more
than you do, Joe.

20:10.113 --> 20:11.848
Look at the fire
out there!

20:14.083 --> 20:17.554
MAN: Boy, is that something!
SHERIFF: Let's go see!

20:27.029 --> 20:30.233
( siren blaring )

20:44.481 --> 20:46.516
CLAYTON:
The power lines are down.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.618
That explains why
the lights went out.

20:51.588 --> 20:52.922
What--?

20:52.922 --> 20:54.457
Hey, look at the car.

20:54.457 --> 20:58.328
CLAYTON:
Where are the three men
you left out here?

21:01.698 --> 21:03.266
OFFICER: Look there!

21:09.606 --> 21:11.841
People in town
started to follow us.

21:11.841 --> 21:14.043
Don't let them come
anywhere near here.

21:14.043 --> 21:17.247
( electronic whirring )

21:19.048 --> 21:21.884
( suspenseful theme playing )

21:27.890 --> 21:31.361
Jump! Get under cover!

21:38.735 --> 21:41.938
( ominous theme playing )

21:46.008 --> 21:48.345
What is that gizmo?

21:48.345 --> 21:52.649
I think that gizmo is
a machine from another planet.

21:52.649 --> 21:56.118
We better get word
to the authorities.

21:56.118 --> 21:59.389
Look!

22:01.558 --> 22:05.762
Sheriff, you'd better
get word to the military.

22:05.762 --> 22:08.298
You're going
to need them out here.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.686
OFFICER:
Get moving, on the double.

22:30.820 --> 22:32.522
OFFICER 2: Take cover
along the riverbed!

22:32.522 --> 22:35.625
Get those 30s
over here.

22:37.994 --> 22:40.663
The area is under control
of Marines from El Toro Base,

22:40.663 --> 22:41.998
and the gully is surrounded.

22:41.998 --> 22:43.666
Oh, and here's
Professor McPherson

22:43.666 --> 22:45.802
of the Canadian Meteorological
Research Council.

22:45.802 --> 22:48.104
Is it true, professor,
you've had reports of landings

22:48.104 --> 22:50.139
in other places? In Canada?

22:50.139 --> 22:51.874
Not in Canada yet,

22:51.874 --> 22:53.276
but in Bordeaux, France,

22:53.276 --> 22:54.944
some in Spain.

22:54.944 --> 22:58.481
There's supposed to be one down
near the Gulf of Taranto, Italy.

22:58.481 --> 23:00.817
We're trying to locate
the second meteor

23:00.817 --> 23:03.586
that landed in this vicinity
just about midnight.

23:03.586 --> 23:06.088
Well, do you think
they come from Mars?

23:06.088 --> 23:08.291
What do you think,
Dr. Forrester?

23:08.291 --> 23:09.826
Oh, it's possible.

23:09.826 --> 23:12.028
At least it seems certain
they're from some planet

23:12.028 --> 23:14.497
other than our own.

23:14.497 --> 23:16.132
Suppose they are
Martians, professor.

23:16.132 --> 23:17.367
What would they look like?

23:17.367 --> 23:19.168
Bigger than us?
Smaller?

23:19.168 --> 23:20.770
McPHERSON:
Well, as to Martians,

23:20.770 --> 23:22.939
our gravitational pull
would weigh them down.

23:22.939 --> 23:25.207
Our heavier air
would oppress them.

23:25.207 --> 23:27.910
REPORTER:
Then you think they'd be
breathing creatures, like us.

23:27.910 --> 23:30.413
What about the heart
and blood and all that?

23:30.413 --> 23:32.048
McPHERSON:
Well, if they are Martians,

23:32.048 --> 23:33.583
and if they do have hearts,

23:33.583 --> 23:35.918
they'd almost certainly
beat at a slower rate.

23:35.918 --> 23:37.954
Their veins
might be distended.

23:37.954 --> 23:40.723
CLAYTON:
Their senses could be quite
different from ours.

23:40.723 --> 23:45.161
They may, for instance,
be able to smell colors.

23:45.161 --> 23:48.030
Precedent in our own evolution
makes it possible

23:48.030 --> 23:50.333
that they have
more than one brain.

23:50.333 --> 23:51.868
REPORTER:
You mean two? Three?

23:51.868 --> 23:53.403
Just think of that,
folks.

23:53.403 --> 23:55.237
CLAYTON:
It's only speculation.

23:55.237 --> 23:58.140
REPORTER:
Now, Dr. Forrester, what about
these meteor machines?

23:58.140 --> 24:00.276
CLAYTON:
They're probably
controlled by jets

24:00.276 --> 24:01.911
after they enter
our atmosphere

24:01.911 --> 24:05.114
and navigated by some form
of gyroscopic mechanism.

24:05.114 --> 24:07.283
Thank you,
Dr. Forrester.

24:07.283 --> 24:09.586
Oh, colonel, can you
tell us anything

24:09.586 --> 24:11.153
about this plane
that's coming over?

24:11.153 --> 24:12.689
It will drop a flare.

24:12.689 --> 24:14.524
That's the only way we dare
put a light on them.

24:14.524 --> 24:16.292
Then Air Force cameramen
will get pictures.

24:16.292 --> 24:18.761
That was Marine Colonel
Ralph Heffner.

24:18.761 --> 24:21.631
There's been a lot of mysterious
activity around the machine.

24:21.631 --> 24:24.734
Lights and dust, as if they're
digging themselves out.

24:24.734 --> 24:26.202
And there it comes again!

24:26.202 --> 24:28.104
( eerie pulsing )

24:28.104 --> 24:29.572
If this keeps up,

24:29.572 --> 24:31.941
it'll be a guide for
the plane when it comes over.

24:31.941 --> 24:35.111
( airplane approaching )

24:37.747 --> 24:39.616
( airplane engine stutters )

24:39.616 --> 24:41.451
Is that the plane now?
Yes. He's signaling.

24:41.451 --> 24:42.819
The pilot has just
blipped his motor.

24:42.819 --> 24:44.554
That means he's
dropped the flare.

24:44.554 --> 24:47.123
He's flying high, so it'll
take a few seconds to come down.

24:47.123 --> 24:48.357
When it does burst,

24:48.357 --> 24:49.826
we shall be
the first men on Earth

24:49.826 --> 24:52.061
to get a real look
at these invaders from space.

24:52.061 --> 24:53.362
( flare bursting )

24:53.362 --> 24:55.598
( eerie pulsing )

24:55.598 --> 24:59.035
( pulsing intensifies )

25:00.369 --> 25:03.840
( high-pitched screeching )

25:07.610 --> 25:10.647
They're after the plane
with their ray!

25:12.181 --> 25:13.416
( men shouting )

25:13.416 --> 25:14.951
Take cover!
Jump for it!

25:21.591 --> 25:23.059
Here we are in--

25:24.360 --> 25:27.196
Hey! They cut me off!

25:27.196 --> 25:28.998
They got my truck!

25:28.998 --> 25:31.468
( pulsing ceases )

25:31.468 --> 25:34.003
It looks like they're gonna come
out of that gully pretty soon.

25:34.003 --> 25:36.939
We'll have to rush our defenses
to be ready when they do.

25:36.939 --> 25:39.075
You're going to need plenty
of reinforcements.

25:39.075 --> 25:40.510
We'll get them.

26:24.487 --> 26:26.589
OFFICER:
They got the fire road blocked.

26:26.589 --> 26:29.025
A truck turned over.

26:29.025 --> 26:30.993
The troops are certainly
moving in here.

26:30.993 --> 26:33.262
I know you sent word
to the Sixth Army Command.

26:33.262 --> 26:35.297
No, I just told them
the local situation.

26:35.297 --> 26:36.666
Colonel Heffner's in charge.

26:36.666 --> 26:38.635
( mechanical screeching )

26:39.869 --> 26:41.604
Never know where you're
going to wind up

26:41.604 --> 26:43.072
when you go to
a square dance, do you?

26:43.072 --> 26:44.807
OFFICER:
Runner? Where's a runner?

26:44.807 --> 26:46.242
That's D-24.

26:46.242 --> 26:48.845
MAN:
Correct.

26:48.845 --> 26:51.981
Now, locate your observation
post on this hill.

26:51.981 --> 26:54.751
Position your recoilless 75s
back here.

26:54.751 --> 26:56.185
Carbon Canyon.

26:56.185 --> 26:57.386
Yes, sir.

26:57.386 --> 26:58.821
I want your battery here.

26:58.821 --> 27:00.890
You may find, at daylight,
you're too exposed,

27:00.890 --> 27:02.992
so keep your prime movers
ready to pull you out fast.

27:02.992 --> 27:04.393
But you'll get
first crack at them.

27:04.393 --> 27:06.428
Suits me. Will that be all?
Colonel Heffner?

27:06.428 --> 27:09.031
Yes, report when
you're set up.

27:11.534 --> 27:13.670
Heffner.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.772
Half-tracks? Okay.

27:15.772 --> 27:18.407
Get in back of hill three.

27:18.407 --> 27:20.442
Repeat, hill three.

27:20.442 --> 27:23.846
If it's a moving target,
follow up from there.

27:23.846 --> 27:25.848
MAN 1: Number six,
do you hear me?
Right.

27:25.848 --> 27:28.585
MAN 2: Anybody get a look
at the Martians yet?

27:28.585 --> 27:31.788
They've located
that second meteor.

27:31.788 --> 27:34.156
MAN 3:
What's your range?

27:34.156 --> 27:35.858
Mark it up.

27:35.858 --> 27:37.694
MAN 4:
Weapons truck turned
over on the road.

27:37.694 --> 27:38.928
Take action and report.

27:38.928 --> 27:41.330
Company tactical net
out of action.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.765
No radio.

27:42.765 --> 27:45.234
MAN 3:
Three. One. Eight. Zero.

27:45.234 --> 27:47.236
There's one,
there's the other.

27:47.236 --> 27:48.905
Here we are
right between them.

27:48.905 --> 27:51.240
So is the town,
I notice.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.309
I warned them to be ready
if they have to evacuate.

27:53.309 --> 27:55.845
I just came to tell you
everyone has been alerted.

27:55.845 --> 27:57.714
Hup!
OFFICER: As you were.

27:57.714 --> 27:59.348
General Mann. I was told
to expect you, sir.

27:59.348 --> 28:01.918
I'm Colonel Heffner.
I'm here to make up a report,

28:01.918 --> 28:03.920
not to interfere with
the operations you've set up.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.855
You're still in command.
Clayton Forrester.

28:05.855 --> 28:07.456
I haven't seen you
since Oak Ridge.

28:07.456 --> 28:08.725
Good to see you, general.

28:08.725 --> 28:10.259
Oh, this is Pastor Collins.
Hi, sir.

28:10.259 --> 28:12.595
Sheriff Bogany,
head of local control.
Sure.

28:12.595 --> 28:13.963
Miss Van Buren.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.598
Miss Van Buren.
How do you do, general?

28:15.598 --> 28:17.199
Would you care for some coffee?
Thank you.

28:17.199 --> 28:19.268
General Mann is
in charge of Intelligence

28:19.268 --> 28:21.704
for the Pacific area.

28:21.704 --> 28:23.272
That's their position.

28:23.272 --> 28:25.642
Well, you've certainly
got them surrounded.

28:25.642 --> 28:28.310
I suppose they've neutralized
all communications here.

28:28.310 --> 28:29.812
Not all, sir.

28:29.812 --> 28:31.513
Radio's out but our field
phones are okay so far.

28:31.513 --> 28:34.150
Well, they'll go the minute
there's another heat ray.

28:34.150 --> 28:36.518
"Cylinder reported
down by Huntington Beach."

28:36.518 --> 28:37.787
Well, that's a job
for the Navy.

28:37.787 --> 28:39.421
Any news from abroad?

28:39.421 --> 28:40.823
Washington is
in constant touch

28:40.823 --> 28:42.992
with the military
of other nations.

28:42.992 --> 28:45.194
Apparently, they're
coming down all over.

28:45.194 --> 28:48.865
South America.
Santiago has two cylinders.

28:48.865 --> 28:51.300
They're outside London.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.202
They're in Naples.

28:53.202 --> 28:55.672
We've got them
between here and Fresno,

28:55.672 --> 28:57.239
outside Sacramento,

28:57.239 --> 28:58.240
two on Long Island.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.276
They're just
coming down at random.

29:00.276 --> 29:01.944
No.

29:01.944 --> 29:04.346
According to information
from foreign sources,

29:04.346 --> 29:07.116
they're working
to some kind of a plan.

29:07.116 --> 29:09.018
Now, what it may be
isn't clear yet,

29:09.018 --> 29:11.788
simply because
once they begin to move,

29:11.788 --> 29:15.357
no more news
comes out of that area.

29:17.359 --> 29:20.897
GENERAL MANN:
We've been getting reports
of destruction, massacre.

29:20.897 --> 29:22.298
Here's an instance:

29:22.298 --> 29:24.233
"Town of Saint-Julien,
south of Bordeaux,

29:24.233 --> 29:26.402
"wiped out by ray
of undetermined nature.

29:26.402 --> 29:29.205
Local reports say
nothing remains."

29:29.205 --> 29:30.940
Nothing remains.
What do you make of that?

29:30.940 --> 29:32.942
All we've seen is
the heat ray they use.

29:32.942 --> 29:34.744
Well, some of our
newest weapons are in here.

29:34.744 --> 29:36.212
We want to be
sure to stop them.

29:36.212 --> 29:37.346
We will, sir.

29:37.346 --> 29:39.615
Now, from the data
from that picture

29:39.615 --> 29:41.684
the Air Force took
earlier tonight,

29:41.684 --> 29:45.587
what we've got out there
is the original pilot ship.

29:45.587 --> 29:46.923
On the basis
of its observations,

29:46.923 --> 29:48.958
the others were guided down.

29:48.958 --> 29:52.328
Pattern-wise,
one lands, then two,

29:52.328 --> 29:54.831
making groups of threes,
joined magnetically.

29:54.831 --> 29:56.866
Is that possible?
If they do it, it is.

29:56.866 --> 29:58.234
My orders are not
to go into action

29:58.234 --> 30:00.169
unless they move out of
the shelter of that gully.

30:00.169 --> 30:02.671
Meanwhile, we'll have
a chance to observe them.

30:02.671 --> 30:05.041
Now, this is the only place
we've had time to surround them

30:05.041 --> 30:06.608
with sufficient force
to contain them.

30:06.608 --> 30:09.912
What happens here will be
a guide to all other operations.

30:09.912 --> 30:11.147
Now, the minute action begins

30:11.147 --> 30:13.049
and a pattern of defense
develops,

30:13.049 --> 30:16.252
I'll get my report
to Washington.

30:16.252 --> 30:17.920
You've deployed
your forces well.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.022
Thank you, sir.
If they start anything,

30:20.022 --> 30:21.958
we can blast them
right off the Earth.

30:21.958 --> 30:26.863
OFFICER: Mortar company,
all units set and ready.

30:26.863 --> 30:31.267
Seventy-five,
all units set and ready.

30:31.267 --> 30:34.737
They'll probably
move at dawn.

30:38.307 --> 30:41.710
( ominous theme playing )

31:12.608 --> 31:14.911
( eerie pulsing in distance )

31:14.911 --> 31:16.378
There's something moving
in the gully.

31:16.378 --> 31:20.116
( alien craft
whining & pulsing )

31:50.679 --> 31:53.582
Look at it, will you?

31:53.582 --> 31:57.253
Beings from another world.

32:04.526 --> 32:06.628
Is that some kind
of a flying machine?

32:06.628 --> 32:08.965
No, no. It's supported
from the ground by rays,

32:08.965 --> 32:11.433
probably some form
of magnetic flux,

32:11.433 --> 32:13.369
like invisible legs.

32:13.369 --> 32:16.138
This is amazing.

32:16.138 --> 32:18.474
They must keep
the opposing poles in balance

32:18.474 --> 32:20.609
and lift the machine.

32:20.609 --> 32:24.013
Stand by to fire.

32:24.013 --> 32:27.149
All command posts,
stand by to fire.

32:32.388 --> 32:36.192
But, colonel,
shooting's no good.

32:36.192 --> 32:37.659
It's always been
a good persuader.

32:37.659 --> 32:40.096
Shouldn't you try to
communicate with them first

32:40.096 --> 32:43.165
and shoot later
if you have to?

33:08.657 --> 33:09.892
OFFICER 1:
Target as indicated.

33:09.892 --> 33:13.529
Repeat, target as indicated.

33:19.068 --> 33:20.369
OFFICER 2:
The 75s report

33:20.369 --> 33:22.138
they've got them
under open sights, sir.

33:22.138 --> 33:24.640
I think we should try
to make them understand

33:24.640 --> 33:26.408
we mean them no harm.

33:26.408 --> 33:28.477
There's another machine
coming out.

33:28.477 --> 33:31.280
( alien crafts
whining & pulsing )

33:36.418 --> 33:39.555
They are living
creatures out there.

33:39.555 --> 33:40.990
But they're not human.

33:40.990 --> 33:42.324
Dr. Forrester says

33:42.324 --> 33:44.160
they're some kind
of advanced civilization.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.895
If they're
more advanced than us,

33:46.895 --> 33:48.764
they should be nearer
the Creator

33:48.764 --> 33:50.499
for that reason.

33:50.499 --> 33:52.068
OFFICER 3:
It'll be
a moving target.

33:52.068 --> 33:55.404
Prepare to follow up.

33:57.239 --> 34:01.077
No real attempt has been made to
communicate with them, you know?

34:01.077 --> 34:05.047
Let's go back inside,
Uncle Matthew.

34:05.047 --> 34:08.250
I've done all I can
in there. You go back.

34:08.250 --> 34:12.254
Sylvia, I like
that Dr. Forrester.

34:12.254 --> 34:14.590
He's a good man.

34:14.590 --> 34:16.257
OFFICER 3:
Attention, all batteries,

34:16.257 --> 34:18.194
prepare for volley fire.

34:18.194 --> 34:21.563
Repeat,
prepare for volley fire.

34:21.563 --> 34:24.366
( alien crafts
whining & pulsing )

34:40.081 --> 34:42.251
COLONEL:
Who's that?

34:47.389 --> 34:49.558
What does he think
he's doing?

34:52.094 --> 34:53.562
Uncle! Uncle Matthew!

34:53.562 --> 34:55.130
It's too late now.
He's too far away.

34:55.130 --> 34:56.331
Stop him!

34:56.331 --> 34:58.034
Though I walk
through the valley

34:58.034 --> 34:59.635
of the shadow of death,

34:59.635 --> 35:01.237
I will fear no evil.

35:01.237 --> 35:04.073
( screaming hysterically ):
Stop him!

35:04.073 --> 35:06.442
It's seen him.

35:10.212 --> 35:13.715
Thou anointest my head
with oil.

35:13.715 --> 35:16.052
My cup runneth over.

35:19.955 --> 35:25.961
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

35:25.961 --> 35:28.564
( alien craft hums repeatedly )

35:31.633 --> 35:33.001
( screams )

35:33.001 --> 35:34.403
Let 'em have it!

35:34.403 --> 35:36.172
Fire!

35:57.426 --> 35:59.528
Those shells
can't get through to them.

35:59.528 --> 36:02.331
They've put out some sort
of electromagnetic covering,

36:02.331 --> 36:04.032
a protective blister.

36:57.018 --> 36:59.221
( all scream )

37:17.606 --> 37:19.275
That skeleton beam
must be what they used

37:19.275 --> 37:20.476
to wipe out the French city.

37:20.476 --> 37:22.378
It neutralizes mesons
somehow.

37:22.378 --> 37:24.813
They're the atomic glue
holding matter together.

37:24.813 --> 37:26.815
Cut across their lines
of magnetic force,

37:26.815 --> 37:29.351
and any object will
simply cease to exist.

37:29.351 --> 37:31.019
Take my word
for it, general.

37:31.019 --> 37:34.623
This type of defense is useless
against that type of power.

37:34.623 --> 37:37.226
You'd better let
Washington know. Fast!

37:38.427 --> 37:41.597
Hold 'em as long as you can.
Right, sir.

37:54.643 --> 37:57.213
Aarggh!

37:58.980 --> 38:02.484
( men screaming )

38:04.886 --> 38:06.388
Order all command posts.

38:06.388 --> 38:09.225
Everything pulled back north
of highway 60 tunnel bunker!

38:09.225 --> 38:11.159
Right.

38:19.668 --> 38:22.271
Aarrggh!

38:39.655 --> 38:42.558
Everybody out of here!
Everybody out!

38:42.558 --> 38:45.193
The Air Force will take care
of these babies now.

38:45.193 --> 38:47.128
Dr. Forrester,
get out of here!

38:47.128 --> 38:49.798
Everybody, out of here!
Everybody--

38:49.798 --> 38:52.401
Aarggh!

39:19.027 --> 39:21.663
You'll hit something.
Can't you go higher?

39:21.663 --> 39:24.065
No, the air will be
full of jets in a minute.

39:24.065 --> 39:26.435
There they are.

39:38.847 --> 39:40.716
( screams )

39:47.155 --> 39:50.359
( alien crafts
whining & pulsing )

40:03.339 --> 40:05.441
( alien weapons
firing )

40:08.209 --> 40:10.812
( explosions )

40:14.650 --> 40:17.386
WOMAN:
All about the Martian
invasion!

40:17.386 --> 40:19.355
They're in New York and Miama!

40:19.355 --> 40:22.391
Fighting outside
Los Angeles!

40:22.391 --> 40:24.993
All about it!

40:24.993 --> 40:27.596
( sirens wailing )

40:41.577 --> 40:43.845
( indistinct conversations )

40:43.845 --> 40:45.814
Hold it right there,
general, please.

40:45.814 --> 40:47.516
You're the gentlemen
I asked to come here.

40:47.516 --> 40:49.685
Get Washington.
What do you think of this?

40:49.685 --> 40:51.052
MAN:
Clear the way.

40:51.052 --> 40:52.921
Is it your opinion
the Army can hold them?

40:52.921 --> 40:54.390
Sorry, I have no time.

40:54.390 --> 40:56.958
You've got guns and equipment
going out there all night.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.961
Come on. Break it up.

40:59.961 --> 41:02.598
The way he's hedging,
maybe the Army didn't hold them.

41:02.598 --> 41:04.833
I've seen news
off the Pacific cables:

41:04.833 --> 41:07.168
Sydney, Australia. Pinang.
Rangoon, India.

41:07.168 --> 41:09.671
From what's coming through,
nobody's stopped them yet.

41:09.671 --> 41:12.107
I want to know,
if the city must be evacuated--

41:12.107 --> 41:14.876
We're ready. Lots of people
have already moved out.

41:14.876 --> 41:17.513
We've mobilized emergency cars
and buses in the yards.

41:17.513 --> 41:19.180
The Red Cross
is standing by.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.516
Now, for your information,

41:20.516 --> 41:22.751
the enemy is 25 or 30 miles
outside Los Angeles.

41:22.751 --> 41:24.720
Not down in full force yet,
but developing.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.254
It can happen any minute.

41:26.254 --> 41:27.623
The crisis will come

41:27.623 --> 41:29.157
if they move toward
the metropolitan area.

41:29.157 --> 41:32.027
Now, we've got to--
Washington is on the line, sir.

41:32.027 --> 41:33.995
General Mann.

41:35.263 --> 41:36.765
I'd say our effective losses

41:36.765 --> 41:40.001
were nearly 60 percent men,
90 percent materiel.

41:40.001 --> 41:43.004
Well, the jets went in,
but not one of them came out.

41:43.004 --> 41:45.407
High-level bombers dropped
everything they can carry.

41:45.407 --> 41:47.676
They were knocked out
of the sky. Bombs did nothing.

41:47.676 --> 41:49.711
Nothing was effective
against them.

41:49.711 --> 41:52.280
Yes, they have some sort
of electronic umbrella.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.649
It's quite impenetrable.

41:53.649 --> 41:55.684
Dr. Forrester believes
they generate atomic force

41:55.684 --> 41:57.118
without the heavy
screening we use.

41:57.118 --> 42:00.456
That's where they get
the power for their rays.

42:01.957 --> 42:03.759
Very well, sir.
Call Victorville.

42:03.759 --> 42:05.427
Tell them I want
the fastest plane they've got.

42:05.427 --> 42:07.863
You'll get further instructions
from Sixth Army Command.

42:07.863 --> 42:09.765
I'll make a statement
to those reporters.

42:09.765 --> 42:11.567
Right.

42:14.703 --> 42:18.640
All right, fellas.
The general will see you now.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.510
General, we heard that
Dr. Clayton Forrester

42:21.510 --> 42:22.711
was out there
with you.

42:22.711 --> 42:23.945
What's he think
about this?

42:23.945 --> 42:26.081
Ask him. He's back
at Pacific Tech.

42:26.081 --> 42:28.416
No, he's not. We tried
to get him there.

42:28.416 --> 42:30.786
He hasn't shown up.

42:30.786 --> 42:33.054
( horses whinnying )

42:33.054 --> 42:35.657
( distant rumbling )

42:36.992 --> 42:39.928
( dramatic theme playing )

42:42.998 --> 42:46.201
( soft, poignant theme
playing )

42:55.043 --> 42:57.513
( distant explosion )

43:04.653 --> 43:07.222
( distant explosion )

43:29.878 --> 43:31.747
Wake up.

43:36.484 --> 43:39.821
Let's get moving,
huh?

43:44.459 --> 43:47.095
Are you all right?

43:47.095 --> 43:48.764
Is that machine--?
It's gone.

43:48.764 --> 43:51.867
And where are we?
Southwest of Corona somewhere.

43:51.867 --> 43:53.669
There must have been
another cylinder down here.

43:53.669 --> 43:57.505
They've been through this whole
area and cleared everybody out.

43:57.505 --> 43:59.374
There's a farm house
out there.

43:59.374 --> 44:03.178
Let's see if we can find
something to eat, huh?

44:10.719 --> 44:12.721
We're doing all right.

44:12.721 --> 44:15.924
You know, I almost forgot
when I ate last.

44:17.258 --> 44:20.662
Hey, that looks good.

44:20.662 --> 44:22.097
You know, mostly
I get my meals

44:22.097 --> 44:23.799
in coffee shops
and restaurants.

44:23.799 --> 44:25.233
Don't you live at home?

44:25.233 --> 44:26.501
No, on the campus.

44:26.501 --> 44:28.670
I haven't any family.

44:28.670 --> 44:30.538
I come from a big one.

44:30.538 --> 44:35.443
There's nine of us.
All in Minnesota...except me.

44:35.443 --> 44:37.512
I have no close folks.

44:37.512 --> 44:40.248
My parents died
when I was a kid.

44:40.248 --> 44:42.984
A big family must be fun.
I imagine...

44:42.984 --> 44:45.286
I imagine it makes you feel
you belong to something.

44:45.286 --> 44:48.690
Oh, it does. Maybe that's why
I feel kind of lost right now.

44:48.690 --> 44:51.593
We'll get
out of here safely.

44:51.593 --> 44:54.095
Don't worry.

44:54.095 --> 44:56.397
But they seem to murder
everything that moves.

44:56.397 --> 45:00.435
If they're mortal, they must
have mortal weaknesses.

45:00.435 --> 45:03.304
They'll be stopped. Somehow.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.241
I've been as close
to them as anyone,

45:06.241 --> 45:08.243
and never close enough
for any real observation.

45:08.243 --> 45:11.813
I feel like I did one time
when I was small,

45:11.813 --> 45:14.916
awful scared and lonesome.

45:14.916 --> 45:18.353
I'd wandered off.
I've forgotten why.

45:18.353 --> 45:21.522
But the family
and whole crowds of neighbors

45:21.522 --> 45:23.424
were hunting for me.

45:23.424 --> 45:26.695
They found me in a church.

45:26.695 --> 45:30.632
I was afraid to go in
anyplace else.

45:30.632 --> 45:33.068
I stayed right by that door,

45:33.068 --> 45:34.703
praying for
the one who loved me best

45:34.703 --> 45:36.905
to come and find me.

45:41.710 --> 45:43.979
It was Uncle Matthew
who found me.

45:45.413 --> 45:47.649
I liked him.

45:47.649 --> 45:50.786
He liked you.

45:50.786 --> 45:52.487
Oh, I could bawl my head off.

45:52.487 --> 45:55.156
But you're not going to.
You're not the kind.

45:55.156 --> 45:57.859
Look, you're tired.
You've been up all night.

45:57.859 --> 45:59.995
You cracked up in a plane,
slept in a ditch.

45:59.995 --> 46:01.429
( dog barks in distance )

46:01.429 --> 46:02.998
You wanna know something?

46:04.032 --> 46:07.168
It doesn't show
on you at all.

46:08.670 --> 46:11.272
( alien vehicle soaring )

46:13.541 --> 46:16.144
( explosions )

46:19.080 --> 46:21.649
Get down!

46:35.363 --> 46:37.899
( explosion )

46:39.634 --> 46:42.838
( alien craft
whining & pulsing )

46:56.617 --> 46:58.186
How long was I out?
Hours.

46:58.186 --> 46:59.888
Oh, I've been
so scared.

46:59.888 --> 47:01.222
They're right outside.

47:01.222 --> 47:04.192
Several of them
came down together.

47:21.342 --> 47:25.080
There's a machine standing
right alongside of us.

48:14.329 --> 48:17.332
( warbling tone )

48:41.823 --> 48:45.426
( whispering ):
Electronic eye.

48:45.426 --> 48:48.029
Like a television camera.

48:50.431 --> 48:53.134
It's looking for us.

49:18.826 --> 49:22.363
( whispering ):
Maybe they're not
too sure we're here.

49:26.167 --> 49:30.305
They could be as curious
about us as we are about them.

49:30.305 --> 49:33.774
Maybe.

49:33.774 --> 49:36.878
Maybe they want to
take us alive.

49:49.991 --> 49:51.526
It's pulling out.

50:00.902 --> 50:04.039
( suspenseful theme playing )

50:04.039 --> 50:07.242
( alien craft
whining & pulsing )

50:09.310 --> 50:10.878
Can't we get out of here?

50:10.878 --> 50:13.281
Shh...

50:17.018 --> 50:19.187
( gasps )

50:19.187 --> 50:22.357
( dramatic theme playing )

50:22.357 --> 50:25.326
( distressed ):
Something moved out there.

50:26.394 --> 50:27.862
There's nothing there
now.

50:27.862 --> 50:29.764
It was one of them.

50:29.764 --> 50:31.199
What was it like?

50:31.199 --> 50:33.935
I couldn't see much in the dark,
but it was one.

50:33.935 --> 50:35.270
We're right
in a nest of them.

50:35.270 --> 50:38.506
I've got to get
a good look at them.

50:45.513 --> 50:48.016
( dramatic theme playing )

50:48.016 --> 50:49.917
They've blocked it.

50:49.917 --> 50:51.886
It's blocked here too.

50:51.886 --> 50:56.024
They've pushed earth
or something all around outside.

50:56.024 --> 50:57.258
Here. This way.

50:57.258 --> 51:00.195
The stairway
up to the attic.

51:21.582 --> 51:23.551
Look out!

51:40.368 --> 51:43.171
( suspenseful theme playing )

52:13.301 --> 52:14.902
( dramatic theme playing )

52:14.902 --> 52:17.105
( gasps )

52:32.320 --> 52:35.256
( alien screeches )

52:51.839 --> 52:55.143
Your scarf.

52:56.211 --> 52:59.214
It's wet.

53:01.882 --> 53:04.685
Blood.

53:05.820 --> 53:07.155
( whimpers )

53:07.155 --> 53:09.056
( screaming hysterically ):
No! No! No!

53:09.056 --> 53:10.458
Stop it!

53:10.458 --> 53:13.461
Stop it! Stop it!
No, please! No blood!

53:16.164 --> 53:18.032
( crying )

53:18.032 --> 53:21.336
( tender theme playing )

53:42.957 --> 53:46.561
We gotta make
a run for it. Come on.

53:46.561 --> 53:50.365
( dramatic theme playing )

53:52.933 --> 53:55.303
NARRATOR:
The Martians had calculated
their descent

53:55.303 --> 53:56.671
upon our Earth

53:56.671 --> 53:58.973
with amazing perfection
and subtlety.

53:58.973 --> 54:00.408
As more of their cylinders

54:00.408 --> 54:02.777
came from the mysterious depths
of space,

54:02.777 --> 54:04.179
their war machines,

54:04.179 --> 54:07.014
awesome in their power
and complexity,

54:07.014 --> 54:08.783
created a wave of fear

54:08.783 --> 54:10.851
which swept into
all corners of the world.

54:10.851 --> 54:12.420
In every country,

54:12.420 --> 54:14.422
government officials
met in desperate conclave,

54:14.422 --> 54:16.591
seeking ways to coordinate
their defenses

54:16.591 --> 54:19.427
with those of other nations.

54:20.795 --> 54:22.963
The government of India,
driven from New Delhi,

54:22.963 --> 54:24.665
met in a railroad coach,

54:24.665 --> 54:26.867
while massive Hindu populations

54:26.867 --> 54:29.170
streamed for
the imagined safety

54:29.170 --> 54:31.439
of the faraway Himalayas.

54:31.439 --> 54:33.508
The redoubtable
Finnish and Turkish armies,

54:33.508 --> 54:35.643
Chinese battalions
and Bolivians

54:35.643 --> 54:38.513
worked and fought furiously.

54:38.513 --> 54:41.216
Every effort against
the tremendous power

54:41.216 --> 54:42.550
of their other-world
antagonists

54:42.550 --> 54:45.653
ended in the same frantic rout.

54:48.756 --> 54:50.891
As the Martians burnt
fields and forests

54:50.891 --> 54:52.893
and great cities
fell before them,

54:52.893 --> 54:55.896
huge populations
were driven from their homes.

54:55.896 --> 54:59.267
A stream of flight
rose swiftly to a torrent.

54:59.267 --> 55:03.170
It became a giant stampede
without order and without goal.

55:03.170 --> 55:07.141
It was the beginning
of the rout of civilization,

55:07.141 --> 55:09.410
of the massacre of humanity.

55:14.549 --> 55:17.485
A great silence
fell over half of Europe

55:17.485 --> 55:21.789
as all communication
was disrupted.

55:21.789 --> 55:23.791
When the last wire photo
out of Paris

55:23.791 --> 55:26.461
reached the French cabinet,
exiled in Strasbourg,

55:26.461 --> 55:30.298
they hit upon the idea of using
super-speed jets as couriers.

55:30.298 --> 55:33.668
Stripped of armament
and loaded with extra fuel,

55:33.668 --> 55:35.470
these planes maintained
connection

55:35.470 --> 55:36.804
with the Scandinavian
countries,

55:36.804 --> 55:39.039
North Africa,
the United States,

55:39.039 --> 55:41.108
and especially with England.

55:41.108 --> 55:43.244
It was plain
the Martians appreciated

55:43.244 --> 55:47.214
the strategic significance
of the British Isles.

55:47.214 --> 55:50.518
The people of Britain
met the invaders magnificently,

55:50.518 --> 55:53.788
but it was unavailing.

55:53.788 --> 55:55.956
As Martians swept
northward toward London,

55:55.956 --> 55:57.992
the British cabinet
stayed in session,

55:57.992 --> 56:00.995
coordinating every item
of information

56:00.995 --> 56:02.530
that could be gathered,

56:02.530 --> 56:05.700
passing it on to
the United Nations in New York.

56:05.700 --> 56:08.303
From there, the news
was forwarded to Washington,

56:08.303 --> 56:10.638
because here
was the only remaining

56:10.638 --> 56:13.073
unassailed strategic point.

56:13.073 --> 56:14.875
MAN 1:
Forty-eight north, two west.

56:14.875 --> 56:17.478
MAN 2:
Thirty-one east.
Anchored on Cairo.

56:17.478 --> 56:19.580
MAN 1:
Checking.
Dover blanked out.

56:19.580 --> 56:21.549
MAN 2:
Brazil, checking.

56:21.549 --> 56:25.320
MAN ( over PA):
Urgent. Major Bentley Dawson,
report to General Mann.

56:25.320 --> 56:28.523
( man speaking Spanish over PA )

56:29.690 --> 56:31.859
MAN 1:
Eighty west by 38 north.

56:31.859 --> 56:33.828
MAN 2:
Twenty-two south? Okay.

56:33.828 --> 56:36.464
MAN 3:
Make every effort to contact
the civil authorities--

56:36.464 --> 56:38.433
( indistinct chatter )

56:38.433 --> 56:41.769
( man speaking French over PA )

56:41.769 --> 56:45.406
Now, this much
is certain:

56:45.406 --> 56:46.674
It's vital to prevent

56:46.674 --> 56:48.376
the Martian machines
from linking up.

56:48.376 --> 56:52.179
Once they do, they adopt an
extraordinary military tactic.

56:52.179 --> 56:54.749
They form a crescent.

56:54.749 --> 56:58.986
They anchor it at one end
and sweep on,

56:58.986 --> 57:01.088
until they've
cleared a quadrant.

57:01.088 --> 57:04.024
Then they anchor
the opposite end

57:04.024 --> 57:06.727
and reverse direction.

57:06.727 --> 57:09.830
They slash across country
like scythes,

57:09.830 --> 57:12.333
wiping out everything that's
trying to get away from them.

57:12.333 --> 57:13.834
That explains why
communication is cut

57:13.834 --> 57:15.636
the moment their machines
begin moving.

57:15.636 --> 57:17.572
Montreal's blacked out.

57:17.572 --> 57:18.939
Nothing more's come through.

57:18.939 --> 57:20.808
Same thing that happened
on the Pacific coast.

57:20.808 --> 57:22.743
Anything from them yet?
No, Mr. Secretary.

57:22.743 --> 57:25.245
We've had nothing
from San Francisco
for over five hours.

57:25.245 --> 57:28.849
Excuse me, gentlemen. Here's
that Los Angeles picture, sir.

57:28.849 --> 57:31.986
This is a sonic radar picture
taken from extreme altitude.

57:31.986 --> 57:33.454
It shows full details

57:33.454 --> 57:35.523
of the Martian nest
outside Los Angeles.

57:35.523 --> 57:39.394
Their machines
appear as round blobs.

57:39.394 --> 57:41.762
Newly fallen cylinders
are elongated.

57:41.762 --> 57:42.897
Mm-hm.

57:42.897 --> 57:45.666
We know there are three
cylinders to each group

57:45.666 --> 57:47.902
and three machines
to each cylinder.

57:53.207 --> 57:56.577
All right. I've seen enough.

57:57.945 --> 58:00.448
There's only one thing
that'll stop the Martians.

58:00.448 --> 58:02.249
We've held back
because of the danger

58:02.249 --> 58:03.751
of radiation to civilians.

58:03.751 --> 58:06.020
Now there's no choice.

58:06.020 --> 58:09.256
The White House will confirm
an order to use the atom bomb.

58:09.256 --> 58:10.791
Then our first
target will be

58:10.791 --> 58:13.327
the initial landing place
outside Los Angeles.

58:13.327 --> 58:14.929
First thing you get there,

58:14.929 --> 58:17.432
arrange for the Pacific Tech
scientists to monitor the drop.

58:17.432 --> 58:18.699
I'll send wire orders
ahead of you

58:18.699 --> 58:21.402
and have the area
clear all round.

58:23.671 --> 58:26.807
We've still time
to hit them before dark.

58:26.807 --> 58:30.845
Then we'll blast them
all over the world.

58:36.851 --> 58:38.986
Forrester, everybody's
been looking for you.

58:38.986 --> 58:40.855
I know. We've walked
halfway from Corona.

58:40.855 --> 58:43.190
Finally found
an abandoned truck.

58:43.190 --> 58:44.692
This is Miss Van Buren.

58:44.692 --> 58:47.962
Dr. Gratzman, Dr. Pryor.
James, Bilderbeck.

58:47.962 --> 58:49.497
What's this I hear
about the A-bomb?

58:49.497 --> 58:50.965
We've been assigned
as special detail.

58:50.965 --> 58:52.967
We're going in right
afterwards, study its effect.

58:52.967 --> 58:54.502
We're leaving
in half an hour.

58:54.502 --> 58:56.203
What's that?
King-size fish eye?

58:56.203 --> 58:57.938
This is an electronic eye.

58:57.938 --> 59:00.240
The Martians modeled it
after their own eye.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.710
They use it the way
we use a periscope.

59:02.710 --> 59:03.911
It'll tell us a lot

59:03.911 --> 59:05.446
about their metals
and alloys.

59:05.446 --> 59:06.947
If this is
actually a lens,

59:06.947 --> 59:08.649
we can find out about
their optics.

59:08.649 --> 59:10.485
Interesting.
Very interesting.

59:10.485 --> 59:12.520
And this...

59:12.520 --> 59:16.524
The blood of a Martian.

59:16.524 --> 59:19.293
WOMAN:
I don't remember
ever seeing blood crystals

59:19.293 --> 59:21.796
as anemic as these.

59:21.796 --> 59:27.568
They may be mental giants,
but by our standards,

59:27.568 --> 59:31.706
physically
they must be very primitive.

59:31.706 --> 59:34.274
Isn't it curious how
everything about them

59:34.274 --> 59:35.910
seems to be in threes?

59:35.910 --> 59:37.545
Their eyes have
three lenses,

59:37.545 --> 59:40.047
three distinct pupils.
A strong light shocks them.

59:40.047 --> 59:41.549
They're not
accustomed to it.

59:41.549 --> 59:42.983
Sunlight on Mars

59:42.983 --> 59:45.720
is approximately half
as strong as we get it.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.287
Add their clouds and dust,

59:47.287 --> 59:50.991
it amounts to no more
than our twilight.

59:52.192 --> 59:55.730
Now, if you'll step
over here, please.

59:55.730 --> 59:57.665
We've rigged the epidiascope

59:57.665 --> 01:00:01.035
to reflect whatever
the Martian lens picks up.

01:00:04.505 --> 01:00:07.842
Move in a little.
Thank you.

01:00:31.832 --> 01:00:35.069
( gentle whirring )

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.109
There's how the Martians see us.

01:00:55.022 --> 01:00:58.726
Evidently there's
a shift in their spectrum.

01:01:00.227 --> 01:01:04.131
Their color absorption
must be different from ours.

01:01:09.904 --> 01:01:11.739
Let's see why they were
so curious about you,

01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:14.074
Miss Van Buren.

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:24.484
Time to get started,
gentlemen.

01:01:24.484 --> 01:01:26.687
Let's go.

01:01:28.823 --> 01:01:30.557
That Martian blood,

01:01:30.557 --> 01:01:32.893
let them make a quick analysis
of it to see what we've got.

01:01:32.893 --> 01:01:34.128
It might give us something.

01:01:34.128 --> 01:01:35.796
Something we could use.
Oh, let it go.

01:01:35.796 --> 01:01:37.497
If you're interested
in Martian blood,

01:01:37.497 --> 01:01:41.435
you'll get all you want right
after the plane drops the bomb.

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:44.605
The Flying Wing
is gonna carry it.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.882
Hello, tower,

01:01:54.882 --> 01:01:57.652
this is Air Force Flying Wing,
ready for takeoff, over.

01:01:57.652 --> 01:01:59.519
Flying Wing,
this is the tower.

01:01:59.519 --> 01:02:01.221
Clear for take-off, over.

01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:04.859
Wish us luck, roger.

01:02:30.651 --> 01:02:32.152
The target for the A-bomb

01:02:32.152 --> 01:02:35.222
is this nest of Martian
machines in the Puente Hills,

01:02:35.222 --> 01:02:37.057
where more of these
meteor-cylinders

01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:39.126
came down
early last evening.

01:02:39.126 --> 01:02:41.461
A plane will pinpoint
the target for the drop

01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:43.197
from six miles up.

01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:46.566
Now, we've been warned that this
bomb is ten times more powerful

01:02:46.566 --> 01:02:48.502
than anything previously used.

01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:50.938
It's the latest thing
in nuclear fission.

01:02:50.938 --> 01:02:53.841
Nothing like this
has ever been exploded before,

01:02:53.841 --> 01:02:55.810
and we're gonna be
pretty darn close.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:59.246
But there are observers down in
the valley in a forward bunker.

01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:01.816
Well, they'll be
a lot nearer than us.

01:03:01.816 --> 01:03:03.884
The whole world is waiting,

01:03:03.884 --> 01:03:06.787
for this will decide
the fate of civilization

01:03:06.787 --> 01:03:09.089
and all humanity.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:13.060
Whether we live or die may
depend on what happens here.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.029
MAN:
Attention, please.

01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:18.398
Four minutes to bomb time.

01:03:18.398 --> 01:03:21.335
REPORTER:
There must be a couple
of million people back of us

01:03:21.335 --> 01:03:25.072
in the shelter of
the San Gabriel hills, waiting.

01:03:25.072 --> 01:03:28.142
Waiting to find out whether
they can go home again.

01:03:28.142 --> 01:03:30.144
Everywhere,
all around the world,

01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:32.446
people have been driven
from their homes.

01:03:32.446 --> 01:03:33.781
Direct cable communication

01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:35.750
is being maintained
with Washington,

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.684
but there's no radio at all.

01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:41.655
Not even with the bombing plane
that's coming over.

01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:45.025
All radio is dead.

01:03:45.025 --> 01:03:47.995
Which means that these
tape recordings I'm making

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:52.332
are for the sake of
future history...if any.

01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:56.003
"Future history," he said.

01:03:57.738 --> 01:03:59.940
Yes, if any.

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:12.386
Bilderbeck has calculated
how long we have got

01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:14.521
until Martians
take over the entire world.

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:17.291
BILDERBECK:
If the A-bomb fails, that is.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:21.395
The Martians can conquer
the Earth in six days.

01:04:21.395 --> 01:04:24.865
The same number of days
it took to create it.

01:04:31.105 --> 01:04:33.040
MAN ( over PA ):
Attention, please.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.242
Two minutes to bomb time.

01:04:35.242 --> 01:04:37.778
Prepare to take shelter.

01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:41.681
If you have no goggles,
turn away.

01:04:41.681 --> 01:04:44.952
Remember, the heat flash
and compression that follow

01:04:44.952 --> 01:04:46.854
are dangerous.

01:05:01.601 --> 01:05:04.138
Fifty seconds.

01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:08.042
There's the plane.
Right.

01:05:09.343 --> 01:05:12.012
Forty seconds.

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:16.851
We've sighted the plane, sir.
Right.

01:05:16.851 --> 01:05:19.419
( plane soaring )

01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:20.787
Thirty seconds.

01:05:20.787 --> 01:05:23.858
Look. Look!

01:05:23.858 --> 01:05:27.094
CLAYTON:
They're using those
protective blisters again.

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:28.762
Twenty seconds.

01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:31.465
Attention. Stand by.

01:05:31.465 --> 01:05:33.968
Fifteen seconds.

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.872
Ten seconds.

01:05:37.872 --> 01:05:44.744
Nine... Eight... Seven...
Six... Five...

01:05:44.744 --> 01:05:49.816
Four... Three... Two... One...

01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:23.850
Hello!

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:25.953
Hello. Hello, there.
What can you see?

01:06:25.953 --> 01:06:29.156
( wind roaring )

01:06:35.996 --> 01:06:37.431
There's something moving!

01:06:48.775 --> 01:06:51.045
They haven't even been touched!

01:07:00.854 --> 01:07:03.223
It didn't stop them.

01:07:03.223 --> 01:07:06.526
Guns, tanks, bombs,
they're like toys against them!

01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:10.564
It'll end only one way.
We're beaten.

01:07:11.731 --> 01:07:13.767
No.

01:07:13.767 --> 01:07:15.970
Not yet.

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:18.939
Washington issued orders.

01:07:18.939 --> 01:07:20.340
In event the A-bomb failed,

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.109
evacuate all cities
in danger of attack.

01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:24.244
They'll be moving
on Los Angeles now.

01:07:24.244 --> 01:07:25.712
We'll establish a line

01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:29.449
and fight them all the way
back to the mountains.

01:07:29.449 --> 01:07:32.886
Our best hope lies in what you
people can develop to help us.

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:36.023
All right, on the double.
Get me back to Sixth Army
headquarters. Hurry up!

01:07:36.023 --> 01:07:39.059
Six days, you said?

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:41.061
Six days.

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:43.697
They'll stamp the city flat.

01:07:43.697 --> 01:07:46.600
( siren wailing )

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.402
We'll take all
our instruments

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:51.171
and establish a base laboratory
in the Rocky Mountains.

01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:52.439
It'll give us time
to search out

01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:53.707
some weakness
in the Martians.

01:07:53.707 --> 01:07:56.276
Forlorn hope,
but there is a chance.

01:07:56.276 --> 01:07:58.845
We may get a lead
from that anemic blood.

01:07:58.845 --> 01:08:01.248
You mean by some
biological approach?

01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:05.352
We know now that we can't
beat their machines.

01:08:05.352 --> 01:08:07.787
We've got to beat them.

01:08:07.787 --> 01:08:10.991
( sirens wailing )

01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:25.171
MAN ( over PA ):
Everybody, listen carefully.

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:27.874
The Martians
are coming this way.

01:08:27.874 --> 01:08:29.709
We must evacuate the city.

01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:33.279
Take food and water
and extra clothing with you.

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.283
All major highways
have been marked

01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:38.218
to lead you to shelter
and welfare centers

01:08:38.218 --> 01:08:39.419
in the hills.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:43.090
( somber theme playing )

01:08:47.894 --> 01:08:50.830
Come on. Come on.

01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:52.166
Keep going.

01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:55.135
Keep going.
Keep moving.

01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:02.341
Keep them rolling, there.

01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:06.513
Keep going.
Come on. Come on!

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:38.044
( sirens wailing )

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.815
Gratzman,
did you get those biotics?

01:10:15.815 --> 01:10:17.517
No. I thought
you had them.

01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:18.985
Never mind,
I'll get them.

01:10:18.985 --> 01:10:22.822
You get in the school bus.
Sylvia will drive you.

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:47.281
( sirens wailing in distance )

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.870
Let me up.

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:45.138
Get off, buster!

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:47.040
I'll give you
$500 for your place.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.508
I'll make it a thousand.

01:11:48.508 --> 01:11:51.177
Money's no good
anymore, Mac!

01:11:57.684 --> 01:12:00.354
MAN 1:
Here comes another truck!

01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:02.456
MAN 2:
Throw that guy off there!

01:12:02.456 --> 01:12:03.857
Get him out of there!

01:12:03.857 --> 01:12:04.891
( shouting )

01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:08.027
Stop, you fools!
Get over! Butt out!

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:11.231
Come on.
Can't you fools--?

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.311
( meows )

01:12:33.587 --> 01:12:35.188
Quick, help me!
We've got to stop them!

01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:37.223
We can't stop them.
The law's no good here now.

01:12:37.223 --> 01:12:38.825
They're thieves,
robbers, worse.

01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:40.927
Wouldn't leave with the rest.
It's like this all over.

01:12:40.927 --> 01:12:44.431
They've gotta be stopped!
Those instruments!

01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:53.440
Hold it! Hold it a minute!

01:12:54.641 --> 01:12:57.143
We've gotta get
those instruments.

01:12:57.143 --> 01:12:59.479
They're our only chance!

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.072
Did that mob grab
the trucks ahead of me?

01:13:26.072 --> 01:13:28.241
There were Pacific Tech
people with those trucks.

01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:29.609
Did you see them?

01:13:29.609 --> 01:13:31.311
I don't know anything
about other trucks.

01:13:31.311 --> 01:13:32.812
There's been fighting
on all the streets.

01:13:32.812 --> 01:13:34.848
The school bus. A girl was
driving. Did they get that?

01:13:34.848 --> 01:13:37.751
If they saw it, they took it.
They'll grab anything on wheels.

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:40.920
You can't buy a ride
for love or money.

01:13:45.659 --> 01:13:48.862
( frantic, soaring theme
playing )

01:14:12.018 --> 01:14:15.021
( ticking )

01:14:31.538 --> 01:14:34.874
( explosions )

01:14:47.253 --> 01:14:51.157
Gratzman! Bilderbeck!

01:14:51.157 --> 01:14:55.094
( echoes ):
Sylvia!

01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:26.960
Hey, you,
better get out of here!

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.563
I'm looking for some
Pacific Tech professors!

01:15:29.563 --> 01:15:31.665
There's nobody left
around here now!

01:15:31.665 --> 01:15:34.000
We had a chance.
We could've stopped them.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.704
The mob stole all the trucks,
smashed everything up.

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:39.873
The fools!
They cut their own throats!

01:15:39.873 --> 01:15:42.942
He's nuts.
Come on. Jump in.

01:15:55.021 --> 01:15:56.289
Hurry up! Jump in!

01:15:56.289 --> 01:15:58.892
There was a girl with them.
If I could find them...

01:15:58.892 --> 01:16:00.694
Come on.
Jump in, will you?

01:16:00.694 --> 01:16:02.428
She's kind of lost.

01:16:02.428 --> 01:16:05.465
You look kind of
lost yourself.

01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:08.401
But I think I know
where she'll be.

01:16:08.401 --> 01:16:09.836
Come on, come on.

01:16:09.836 --> 01:16:11.971
It's your last chance
to get out of here.

01:16:11.971 --> 01:16:14.974
( explosions )

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.790
( distant singing )

01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:03.590
CONGREGATION:
* Amen *

01:17:05.559 --> 01:17:10.630
MINISTER:
We humbly beseech
thy divine guidance, O Lord.

01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:12.265
Deliver us
from the fear

01:17:12.265 --> 01:17:14.601
which has come upon us...

01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:15.902
( explosions in distance )

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:19.238
...from the evil
that grows ever nearer...

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.810
...from the terror
that soon will knock upon

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.981
the very door of this,
thy house.

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:34.220
O Lord, we pray thee,

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:38.758
grant us the miracle
of thy divine intervention.

01:17:38.758 --> 01:17:41.561
( organ plays )

01:17:44.397 --> 01:17:46.800
Don't go, son.
Stay with us.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.003
No, I...
I'm looking for someone.

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:52.471
She'll be in a church,
near the door.

01:17:52.471 --> 01:17:55.241
( alien weapons firing,
explosions )

01:18:25.404 --> 01:18:28.608
( man praying in Spanish )

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:34.113
( woman praying in Spanish )

01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:47.961
( praying in Spanish )

01:18:58.604 --> 01:19:00.239
Forrester!

01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:02.075
Duprey, Bilderbeck,

01:19:02.075 --> 01:19:04.610
are you...?

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:05.812
Where are the others?

01:19:05.812 --> 01:19:07.981
A mob attacked us.

01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:10.216
We don't know
what happened to the rest.

01:19:10.216 --> 01:19:11.785
I...

01:19:11.785 --> 01:19:12.986
I got...

01:19:12.986 --> 01:19:16.823
I got knocked
under our truck.

01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:20.559
Du-- Duprey pulled me out.

01:19:20.559 --> 01:19:22.829
What happened to Sylvia?

01:19:22.829 --> 01:19:25.999
We never did see her again.

01:20:02.869 --> 01:20:05.004
In our peril, we plead,

01:20:05.004 --> 01:20:08.742
succor and comfort us
in this hour.

01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:11.210
Please, God.

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:13.913
( alien weapons firing,
explosions )

01:20:17.817 --> 01:20:21.020
( congregation sings
mournful hymn )

01:20:23.757 --> 01:20:26.659
( booming explosions )

01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:28.928
Sylvia!

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.466
( explosions, screaming )

01:20:33.466 --> 01:20:36.469
( singing continues )

01:20:39.438 --> 01:20:41.040
Sylvia!

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:49.448
Sylvia!

01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:55.088
Here! Here!

01:20:55.088 --> 01:20:56.990
Sylvia!

01:20:59.658 --> 01:21:03.062
( alien weapons firing )

01:21:06.365 --> 01:21:09.068
Let me through, please!

01:21:19.779 --> 01:21:23.016
( screaming, panicked shouting )

01:21:33.026 --> 01:21:36.229
( engine whirrs wildly )

01:21:46.405 --> 01:21:47.740
( silence )

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.276
MINISTER ( faintly ):
Almighty and most
merciful Father,

01:21:50.276 --> 01:21:52.411
we have erred and strayed
from thy ways like lost sheep.

01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:55.548
We have followed too much
the devices

01:21:55.548 --> 01:21:57.416
and desires
of our own hearts.

01:21:57.416 --> 01:22:00.786
We have offended
against thy holy laws.

01:22:00.786 --> 01:22:05.291
We have left undone those things
which we ought to have done.

01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:07.560
And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.929
CLAYTON ( whispering ):
Maybe they've gone another way.

01:22:09.929 --> 01:22:13.066
( solemn violin theme playing )

01:22:20.039 --> 01:22:22.008
Let's go see.

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:24.677
WOMAN:
Do you see anything outside?

01:22:24.677 --> 01:22:27.213
MAN:
It must be all right.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.508
( crashing )

01:23:34.813 --> 01:23:36.249
Something's happening to them.

01:23:56.035 --> 01:23:58.537
It's dead.

01:24:14.653 --> 01:24:18.357
We were all praying
for a miracle.

01:24:20.726 --> 01:24:23.929
( church bells ringing )

01:24:30.136 --> 01:24:32.038
NARRATOR:
The Martians had no resistance

01:24:32.038 --> 01:24:33.672
to the bacteria
in our atmosphere,

01:24:33.672 --> 01:24:36.209
to which we have
long since become immune.

01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:38.411
Once they had breathed our air,

01:24:38.411 --> 01:24:41.981
germs which no longer affect us
began to kill them.

01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:44.217
The end came swiftly.

01:24:44.217 --> 01:24:45.518
All over the world,

01:24:45.518 --> 01:24:48.754
their machines
began to stop and fall.

01:24:48.754 --> 01:24:51.824
After all that men could do
had failed,

01:24:51.824 --> 01:24:55.728
the Martians were destroyed
and humanity was saved

01:24:55.728 --> 01:24:57.663
by the littlest things,

01:24:57.663 --> 01:25:00.733
which God, in his wisdom,
had put upon this Earth.

01:25:00.733 --> 01:25:08.107
CONGREGATION:
* In this world and the next *

01:25:08.107 --> 01:25:14.413
* Amen *
