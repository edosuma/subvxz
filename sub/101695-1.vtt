WEBVTT

02:51.294 --> 02:52.128
Hey.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.046
Which pump?

02:53.088 --> 02:54.632
Oh, uh.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.467
I'm just messing with you.

02:56.508 --> 02:57.509
There's only one.

02:57.551 --> 02:59.594
Oh.

03:00.596 --> 03:01.472
That's a new one.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.349
Oh yeah, I mean you can't
knock it.

03:03.390 --> 03:05.518
Tourists, love them.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.770
They just go nuts for that crap.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.564
Oh, I'm sure they do.

03:09.604 --> 03:10.522
What's the saying?

03:10.564 --> 03:12.525
There's one born every minute.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.401
Ooh.

03:15.151 --> 03:15.944
Hello.

03:15.986 --> 03:17.780
So where are you headed?

03:17.822 --> 03:21.825
The Gifford Pinchot National
Forest.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.036
Which reminds me,

03:25.121 --> 03:28.207
I've been having a little
difficulty here.

03:28.248 --> 03:29.125
So let me,

03:30.543 --> 03:31.377
wait, no, no.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.670
All right, I thought it went
this way.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.337
All right, I need to go this
way.

03:34.379 --> 03:37.507
Unfortunately, I am not
as good at cartographer

03:37.550 --> 03:40.136
as I am a lepidopterist, uh
okay.

03:40.177 --> 03:41.094
What?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.471
- I'm looking.
- What are we doing?

03:42.513 --> 03:44.390
Bear with me one second,
please.

03:45.765 --> 03:48.227
Okay, because, let's see.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.396
So we be, oh yeah.

03:50.437 --> 03:51.271
Am I here?

03:52.772 --> 03:54.358
You are here.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.110
Ah, okay.

03:56.151 --> 03:59.571
You one of those owl people.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.698
No, no, no, no, no.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.201
I'm actually searching for
new species of butterfly,

04:04.242 --> 04:05.368
Butterflies?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.204
And moths.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.371
In fact, three years ago,

04:07.413 --> 04:09.415
I discovered six new species

04:09.456 --> 04:11.250
and that is a Xerces Society
record,

04:11.292 --> 04:14.420
and I've authored several
books on the subject.

04:14.461 --> 04:15.253
You don't say.

04:15.295 --> 04:17.673
Yeah, that's kind of a big
deal,

04:17.714 --> 04:19.466
just so you know.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.345
And I should be getting there
just in time for the hatch.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.555
Much money in butterflies?

04:24.596 --> 04:25.555
- And moths.
- And, and moths.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.391
Yes, um, normally, no,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.269
but I do have a Guggenheim.

04:32.271 --> 04:33.980
You hunt butterflies with a
gun?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.192
No, it's a grant.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.821
And one doesn't hunt
butterflies, good grief.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.531
Where are you hiking to?

04:42.572 --> 04:44.407
I'm going from Highway 12,

04:44.449 --> 04:47.245
over Mount Adams to the Columbia
Gorge.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.581
On foot?

04:50.622 --> 04:51.748
Yeah.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.877
Jesus, how long does that
take?

04:54.918 --> 04:57.879
Well, I'm anticipating up to a
month.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.049
Didn't Petras brothers do
something like that back in '88?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.759
Yeah, they sure did.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.093
They got their ass kicked.

05:04.011 --> 05:04.804
Well.

05:04.846 --> 05:05.805
Yeah, he's right.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.516
I mean, you should not do this
right now.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.350
That's trail's no joke.

05:10.392 --> 05:12.310
The bears have slept awful
long.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.855
They're gonna be extra hungry.

05:16.815 --> 05:18.775
I think I'll be, I'll be fine.

05:18.817 --> 05:19.818
Thank you though.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.195
I've done several
overnights in the field, so.

05:22.237 --> 05:23.322
Overnights.

05:23.363 --> 05:24.197
Overnights?

05:26.576 --> 05:30.288
Perhaps I should get
another bag of peanuts.

05:30.329 --> 05:31.247
For the, it's a long trip.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.292
It's not the first
time I've ever heard that.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.125
Getting it in right the first
time.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.425
It was so funny.

07:07.759 --> 07:09.762
See you in the rec room.

07:10.762 --> 07:13.139
But you can't have
bees in your walls, Bob,

07:13.182 --> 07:14.934
you're going to have to
spray before summer comes.

07:14.975 --> 07:17.019
They're harmless honeybees.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.562
Nature's pollinators.

07:18.603 --> 07:19.813
Harmless?

07:19.855 --> 07:20.897
When it heats up, you're going
to have

07:20.939 --> 07:23.108
every rat in the county
running around your place.

07:23.149 --> 07:24.901
I didn't realize your PhD in
art history

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
made you an expert on rodents,
Carl.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.073
Who's to say that the
chemicals that we spray

07:30.115 --> 07:31.741
on so-called nuisance species,

07:31.783 --> 07:35.663
aren't affecting other insect
populations.

07:35.704 --> 07:36.496
You know?

07:36.538 --> 07:37.539
And that's another reason why

07:37.581 --> 07:40.250
my Gifford Pinchot
expedition is so critical.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.795
Nobody has amassed a
comprehensive list

07:42.836 --> 07:44.671
of the Lepidoptera in the
region.

07:44.713 --> 07:47.216
And until we catalog all the
species that reside there,

07:47.257 --> 07:50.218
how are we gonna know whether
their numbers are dwindling?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.930
That is a great point.

07:53.973 --> 07:54.848
In fact, tell us a little bit
more

07:54.891 --> 07:57.560
about this proposal of yours.

07:57.601 --> 07:59.728
I assume that you already
have a start date,

07:59.769 --> 08:01.313
you've already planned out.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.399
I don't have a date as of yet.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.402
My, my class schedule is,
is just crazy this semester.

08:07.444 --> 08:08.612
So you're going during the
summer break.

08:08.653 --> 08:09.447
Oh that's terrific.

08:09.487 --> 08:10.322
Summer makes perfect sense.

08:10.363 --> 08:11.448
Yeah.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.617
Not necessarily, I don't
have a date as of yet.

08:13.658 --> 08:16.077
It's really a complicated
endeavor, gentlemen.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.288
Yeah, it must be.

08:17.329 --> 08:19.122
You've been talking
about this for years now.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.124
Yeah.

08:20.165 --> 08:22.293
So Bob, will you bring
your supplies with you

08:22.334 --> 08:24.794
or are you going to have
them drop by helicopter?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.132
Well, I suppose, I suppose
there's a,

08:28.173 --> 08:30.133
you bring some and then others
are dropped

08:30.175 --> 08:31.593
and then one would have.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.721
You have gym membership,
you've been going right?

08:34.764 --> 08:35.681
Checking it out, getting
yourself ready.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.474
I'm, I'm in very good shape.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
My BMI is actually a,

08:39.393 --> 08:40.728
I can't remember if it's a low
or high,

08:40.769 --> 08:41.812
but whatever that number
it's supposed to be

08:41.854 --> 08:43.105
is, it's better.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.357
Bob, you've been camping
before, right?

08:45.524 --> 08:47.985
Yes, of course I've been
camping before.

08:48.027 --> 08:48.985
Cub Scouts, that kind.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.821
I mean, have I done
a, an expedition, no.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.073
but I've been overnight.

08:52.114 --> 08:52.949
What happens if you get sick?

08:52.990 --> 08:53.783
Sprained ankle, something like
that?

08:53.823 --> 08:55.492
What if you broke your leg,
Bob?

08:55.534 --> 08:56.660
What if you lost your glasses?

08:56.701 --> 08:58.287
There are mountain lions out
there too.

08:58.328 --> 08:59.120
Rattlesnakes.

08:59.163 --> 08:59.956
And tigers.

08:59.996 --> 09:01.373
Okay, okay.

09:01.414 --> 09:02.290
Have you ever sucked the venom
out

09:02.332 --> 09:03.541
of a poisonous bite, Bob, ever?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.043
Big rivers you can drown in.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.004
I went to the rental car place

09:07.046 --> 09:11.926
and I see this giant
broken down station wagon

09:11.967 --> 09:13.426
that they're gonna junk,

09:13.469 --> 09:15.596
and I'm like that one.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.348
Give me that one.

09:17.389 --> 09:18.765
And they did.

09:18.807 --> 09:22.562
And I drove it up to 84
and I get it going 105.

09:24.437 --> 09:25.230
No.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.606
And then I come around the
corner

09:26.649 --> 09:27.984
and all of a sudden there it is

09:28.024 --> 09:32.654
that big yellow sign, runaway
truck ramp.

09:33.530 --> 09:34.573
Tell them, tell them.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.744
Oh well, it.

09:38.785 --> 09:41.037
The car bottomed out,
she snapped the front axle,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.581
and Thea broke her nose and
chipped

09:42.623 --> 09:44.750
her two front teeth on the
steering wheel.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.585
Oh goodness.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.543
Yes, those are plastic.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.379
Oh my God.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.381
So, reckless and
irresponsible.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.631
Irresponsible?

09:51.673 --> 09:52.466
Yes.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.466
What are you talking about?

09:53.509 --> 09:57.180
I sprung for the insurance
when I rented it.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.307
Okay, that wasn't what.

09:59.347 --> 10:00.140
You all right?

10:00.182 --> 10:00.975
Mm-hmm.

10:01.017 --> 10:01.809
You okay?

10:01.850 --> 10:02.643
Mm-hmm.

10:02.684 --> 10:03.476
Yeah, yeah.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.729
I just want to tell them about
you.

10:04.769 --> 10:05.730
Are, you all right?

10:05.770 --> 10:06.605
Mm-hmm.

10:08.481 --> 10:11.067
So exciting.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.238
Bob's publisher can't wait
to read the first draft

10:14.279 --> 10:15.906
of his next book.

10:15.947 --> 10:17.199
Mm, yes.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.037
Well, are you going to
be doing the illustrations

10:21.077 --> 10:22.413
for this one as well?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.538
Well, of course.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.249
How are you going to find
another artist who knows

10:25.291 --> 10:26.209
the difference between

10:26.250 --> 10:28.878
an Arabia Magdalena and a common
Alpine?

10:29.921 --> 10:30.713
Can't be done.

10:30.754 --> 10:32.340
You can't, they don't exist.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.424
Well, I can't wait to read it.

10:34.466 --> 10:37.761
And I, for one, can't wait
to get started working on it.

10:37.802 --> 10:42.807
And I mean that quite literally,
I mean, I truly can't wait.

10:44.851 --> 10:46.144
Can I have a water?

10:46.187 --> 10:46.979
Yeah, of course, of
course.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.855
Okay, thanks.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.010
Come on, big fella.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.231
Oh God, sorry, sorry.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.569
Bob, let's dial back on
you being so miserable.

12:59.611 --> 13:02.197
Well, I apologize, but my wife
is.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.075
Alive.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.120
I'm alive.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
I know.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.999
I know.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.417
I know.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.251
I'm okay.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.253
I know.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.127
I know.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.299
Stop, no!

13:21.341 --> 13:23.385
Ow, quit it, don't!

13:24.302 --> 13:25.136
Don't.

13:28.515 --> 13:29.307
Thea.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.225
I'm fine, I'm fine, look.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.476
No, you're not fine.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.394
Yes I am.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.271
Honey.

13:35.605 --> 13:37.232
Grab your girlfriend, Marsha.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.775
Go look for specimens.

13:38.817 --> 13:39.860
No.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.862
And scribble down some of that
poetry

13:40.903 --> 13:42.947
you keep threatening to write.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.240
Just, just get away from me for
awhile.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.576
No.

13:46.616 --> 13:48.660
Thea no, hey, hey, hey.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.703
I'm here right now.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.538
What can I do?

13:50.580 --> 13:51.497
Go.

13:51.538 --> 13:54.542
I already made you a
lunch, it's with Marsha.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.585
Go.

13:56.626 --> 13:58.128
Just go chase something.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.591
Thank you.

14:01.631 --> 14:02.424
You're welcome.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.259
I love you.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.343
I love you more.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.855
Ma'am, don't change your
baby on the air hockey table.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.942
One adult, no children.

15:00.982 --> 15:03.068
I'm joining a birthday party.

15:03.985 --> 15:07.532
Hey Steve, do we have a
birthday party scheduled today?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.598
Don't test me, dude.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.398
Game over.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.592

19:00.765 --> 19:02.975
I'd say bitter, not sour.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.312
I would have said bitter.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.018
Supposed to be one left over.

24:11.741 --> 24:12.617
Did you know that?

24:15.538 --> 24:16.372
Sorry.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.802
Wait, Marsha?

24:30.845 --> 24:33.096
It's bad luck to name it after
me.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.472
You know like a boat.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.100
Wait, you named this after a
boat?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.934
No, it's bad luck.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.313
You don't name a boat after your
wife?

24:40.354 --> 24:41.771
Oh, I didn't, I'm not a
Seafarer.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.691
Wll, I will get you a
captain's hat.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.567
All right, thank you.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.818
And I would like to try this
bad boy.

24:46.861 --> 24:47.653
Bad boy?

24:47.694 --> 24:49.905
Bad girl, bad girl, bye.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.573
I see another bad girl.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.950
Oh, I've got a bad girl.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.451
No!

24:54.492 --> 24:55.285
Bad boy's coming.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.467
Ow, don't.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.343
Sorry.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.014
I've got your electrolytes
and you're water.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.932
I know, I know.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.109
What's gonna happen to you when
I'm gone?

25:33.449 --> 25:35.368
You're gonna be fine.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.579
Do I look like I'm gonna be
fine?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.082
Do I?

25:42.124 --> 25:42.959
Huh, do I?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.219
I don't need an audience!

25:54.135 --> 25:55.930
I don't need an audience, go!

25:57.390 --> 25:58.432
I just want to make sure,

25:58.473 --> 26:00.183
make you feel better.

26:13.530 --> 26:18.536
What have I done to
deserve this?

28:35.088 --> 28:36.631
Oh, hey.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.885
Do you need a painkillers or
water?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.057
When I wrecked that stupid
rental car,

28:47.518 --> 28:49.060
you must've been furious.

28:50.020 --> 28:50.980
Thea.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.398
You were furious, why
didn't you yell at me?

28:55.942 --> 28:56.777
It's fine.

29:00.906 --> 29:01.740
Bob.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.161
We're almost out of the
Dilaudid.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.623
I'll call the pharmacy,

29:10.540 --> 29:11.708
put in another order.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.756
I played one last trick on
you.

29:18.173 --> 29:23.179
And this time you're
gonna be really pissed.

29:23.221 --> 29:24.763
And burdock root.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.432
We are now officially out of
burdock root.

29:29.769 --> 29:33.605
With any luck, you'll get
the punchline in a few weeks.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.278
I guess I can have Ms
Santisa drive me into town.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.241
That'll be Friday, so
I think we have enough.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.619
We have enough until then,
when she can drive it down.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.455
Hey,

29:51.082 --> 29:52.124
just be with me.

29:58.881 --> 29:59.715
Come on.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.020
Hey Bob.

30:14.063 --> 30:14.897
Hm?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.357
Knock knock.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.028
Thea.

30:21.069 --> 30:21.987
Come on.

30:24.115 --> 30:24.949
Knock knock.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.328
Who's there?

30:40.964 --> 30:41.798
Death.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.386
That's not funny.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.514
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.730
It was a little funny.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.158
All right, it's a little
funny.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.382
I mean,

32:04.423 --> 32:06.217
if we're not going to personally
experience biodiversity,

32:06.259 --> 32:08.510
we won't expect it to exist
anywhere.

32:08.553 --> 32:13.558
And really only by observing
and recording what's out there

32:14.432 --> 32:16.434
can we hope to?

32:21.816 --> 32:22.650
Conserve it.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.026
We hope to conserve it.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.241
Okay, well thank you
very much for your time.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.785
Again, I can explain any of
this.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.123
I'm here to sign books if you
want.

33:54.991 --> 33:55.826
Oh wow.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.123
Thea.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.130

44:07.146 --> 44:09.481

don't you?

44:10.690 --> 44:12.984
You think I crapped my own
pants?

44:14.027 --> 44:15.237

44:15.278 --> 44:16.072
Why would I?

44:16.112 --> 44:17.239

crapping monster, yes!

44:25.748 --> 44:26.581
God.

44:31.503 --> 44:34.297
Yes, it does look like a crapped
my pants.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.967
No it doesn't, 'cause it's on
the outside.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.134
If I did that, it would have had

44:37.175 --> 44:39.344

take it back.
