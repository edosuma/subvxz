WEBVTT

00:22.413 --> 00:25.634
[serene music playing]

00:34.643 --> 00:37.428
I am so sorry for your loss,
Mr. Cole.

00:41.998 --> 00:42.868
[gasps]

01:13.073 --> 01:15.684
[jury foreman] On the charge
of vehicular homicide,

01:15.727 --> 01:19.775
we find the defendant,
Phillip Arrington, not guilty.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.386
[crowds murmurs]

01:35.660 --> 01:39.621
[serene music playing]

01:44.887 --> 01:49.413
[Leland Hardt]
People can change,
find their better angels,

01:49.457 --> 01:52.155
but I've done quite well betting that they won't.

01:53.200 --> 01:59.597
My name is Leland Hardt
and I met Lucas Cole,
a young prosecutor

01:59.641 --> 02:02.078
on the afternoon of Good Friday.

02:02.992 --> 02:07.127
Lucas became involved in a case concerning my wife Anna.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.739
An unexpected result...

02:10.782 --> 02:13.307
-Hey.
-[Leland] ... as I suspect
for the other cases

02:13.350 --> 02:14.743
Lucas handled this day.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.398
Eye on the ball.

02:21.576 --> 02:24.231
-[grunts]
-[Lucas] You're not focusing,
Johnny.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.669
Sorry to bother you
so early, Mr. Cole.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.846
-If we could just talk a minute.
-My office.

02:30.889 --> 02:34.719
I was hoping you might speak to
Mr. Sensabaugh away from...

02:34.763 --> 02:36.547
Just for a minute, please.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.593
-If you could just explain.
-Come on, Johnny!
Eye on the ball.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.509
[Johnny grunts]

02:41.552 --> 02:42.901
Yeah, I didn't hurt him.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.340
You know that bank guy is
not being honest, Sir.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.777
-[Lucas] Pick those up.
-I got him off the property.
That's a fact.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.127
-Put your hands on him?
-We're not conceding that.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.825
Yes, I did.
Walked him off the property.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.914
-Threw him to the ground?
-[Peter Sensabaugh] No.

02:55.958 --> 02:59.744
His mom called him.
Some stranger in her yard,
taking photos.

02:59.788 --> 03:02.530
They were trying to foreclose
on her, Mr. Cole. She was upset.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.227
[Lucas] Sounds like motive.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.708
That man wasn't even
allowed to be on the grounds.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.449
That man's in a neck brace.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.928
I didn't hit him.

03:09.972 --> 03:12.061
-Sworn statement.
-I'm telling the truth.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.497
[Lucas] The truth,
Mr. Sensabaugh,

03:13.541 --> 03:15.978
if this case goes to trial,
you will lose.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.981
Something your new attorney
seems reluctant to tell you.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.591
I'm just a working guy,
Mr. Cole.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.072
I'm not looking
for any trouble.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.118
You have until this afternoon
to accept the plea deal
or I have to take this to trial.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.424
[Peter] So, you're asking me
to lie.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.952
I didn't harm that man,
so help me God.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.651
-[Lucas] Come on, let's go.
-[Johnny] Okay.

03:36.694 --> 03:37.913
Let's clean up.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.092
[sighs]

03:45.225 --> 03:49.229
[tranquil music playing]

04:17.082 --> 04:17.952
[car door bangs]

04:28.311 --> 04:32.054
[Leland] If you asked me what sort of man is this Lucas Cole,

04:32.097 --> 04:37.929
well, at first I would have said a lost soul,

04:37.973 --> 04:41.716
no shortage of those,
and I'm glad for it...

04:41.759 --> 04:44.501
They can be led
in any direction.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.070
Later in the day
I would have told you,

04:48.113 --> 04:55.251
"No, this is an ambitious man,
a scheming man."

04:55.295 --> 04:57.645
Then, later still,
I would've said,

04:57.688 --> 05:01.126
"No, this is an
honorable person."

05:01.170 --> 05:06.523
But now, looking back
on this Good Friday, I wonder.

05:08.351 --> 05:11.311
Lucas, what sort of man are you?

05:24.585 --> 05:29.851
[calm music playing]

05:57.531 --> 06:02.971
[Lucas] No. No, no, no,
it's perfectly legal.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.539
Home base of the company becomes
the Cayman Islands,

06:05.582 --> 06:09.281
they treat your income as
passive, half the tax rate
as the average Joe.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.373
Just a sec,
I need to call my wife.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.210
Hey.
You both making home safely?

06:25.254 --> 06:26.908
[Emily] Yeah.
Grandpa was so proud of him.

06:26.951 --> 06:27.996
We're, we're almost home.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.999
-[car horn honks]
-[brake screech]

06:35.438 --> 06:39.355
[police siren wailing
in distance]

06:46.101 --> 06:49.844
[Leland] I sent my wife and bodyguard on a simple task,

06:49.887 --> 06:53.238
a gesture of respect
to the District Attorney.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.762
Lucas, Lucas! Over here.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.722
I'd like you to meet
Leland Hardt's wife, Anna.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.944
Lucas, hi.
Eliot speaks so highly.

07:03.814 --> 07:07.688
Mr. Hardt said you
were only supposed to speak
to Mr. Brennar, ma'am.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.386
So controlling, my husband.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.127
But take away his money
and power,

07:12.170 --> 07:15.522
and all that's left is just...
more.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.964
Ma'am, you dropped something.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.400
[clicks tongue]

07:30.101 --> 07:32.364
[Leland]
I should've been there myself.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.150
Before the matter
got out of hand.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.502
Listen, I need you to help me
make things right.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.591
Hit-and-run.
Still under the radar.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.289
Driver was Mrs. Hardt.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.857
Lawyers?

07:46.901 --> 07:49.730
Leland Hardt asked for a private
word with her as a courtesy,
doesn't want a media circus.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.123
This from a man who owns
a television network.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.344
We live in a world of irony,
don't we, Lucas?
It's our one true religion.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.216
I won't leak to the press,
you know that.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.653
Not where I'm going with this.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.091
Alright, give me the file
and I'll just take a look.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.701
There's nothing to study.
It was just an accident.

08:04.745 --> 08:05.920
Drugs? Alcohol?

08:07.443 --> 08:10.141
She'd had a drink or two,
but blood levels were okay.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.273
Any damage?

08:12.666 --> 08:15.146
Some kid crossing
against the light.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.105
He'll be alright.
Just got released
from the hospital.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.891
I'll work up a plea bargain,
see how much time
she needs to serve.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.720
She thought she hit
a garbage can.
Bad neighborhood.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.201
-Says she was being followed.
-She left a kid on the road.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.420
And she turned herself in,
30 minutes later.

08:28.464 --> 08:31.206
-Still means jail time.
-No, this one we're dropping.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.424
They won't take a plea.
The case won't hold in court.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.168
-Eyewitnesses?
-[Eliot] No.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.389
I'll figure out something,
put her away.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.869
Well, that's very kind of you,
but, no.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.131
I'm not risking our track record
on a lost cause.

08:44.174 --> 08:47.527
Lucas, I need you to break
the news to the boy's mother.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.093
-Absolutely not.
-I'd send someone else,

08:49.137 --> 08:51.574
but they don't have that
Lucas Cole touch.

08:51.618 --> 08:55.360
The ability to alienate everyone
and still get whatever you want.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.058
It's a gift.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.407
[Lucas scoffs]

09:04.674 --> 09:06.328
[knocking]

09:06.371 --> 09:08.286
-What now?
-Your 10 A.M. is here.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.729
A Mr. Jackie Sendell Simms
to see you.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.383
Ah. Send him in, Helene.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.910
In from the city,
back for a visit?
Do you mind if I sit in?

09:24.868 --> 09:27.044
Have a seat, Jackie.

09:27.088 --> 09:30.395
[Eliot] I'd love your client's
autograph for my youngest.
Huge fan.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.527
[sighs]

09:35.923 --> 09:39.970
First of all, my client accepts
full responsibility.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.452
-Oh, that's good to know.
-For any misperceptions.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.847
My client is a role model,

09:46.890 --> 09:49.110
one who can make a
meaningful contribution to
educating the public on the...

09:49.153 --> 09:52.113
Your client is going to jail
for a very long time.

09:52.156 --> 09:55.899
Lucas, if I might-- Okay.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.380
Can I speak frankly,
just among the three of us?

09:59.773 --> 10:02.906
Eliot and I worked here together
before you arrived, Lucas.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.866
I actually sat
right at this table.

10:05.909 --> 10:10.305
And we both understood which
battles were worth fighting
and which weren't.

10:11.523 --> 10:16.050
Eliot's gone on to be
District Attorney for forever.
[laughs]

10:16.093 --> 10:20.315
And I've gone on to enjoy
my share of success
as a defense attorney.

10:21.272 --> 10:25.102
Point is, my client is a highly
respected man,

10:25.146 --> 10:30.630
and this isn't a battle
you want to fight,
don't you think, Eliot?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.240
Well, that is a good point.

10:32.283 --> 10:36.026
And I'm not up to speed
on the case, so, you know,

10:36.070 --> 10:41.684
but, as I understand it, your
highly respected client took
advantage of two teenage girls.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.122
-It's not true.
-[Eliot] Yeah, I kinda think
it is.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.212
And you may think of this
as a battle, Jackie,

10:48.256 --> 10:53.522
but, uh, I have a feeling Lucas
here considers this a crusade.

10:53.565 --> 10:58.658
I mean, you're the reason he
stepped away from the fat money
of corporate law. Hmm?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.050
What does this have
to do with me?

11:00.094 --> 11:01.922
Nothing.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.489
Then what are we talking about?
There isn't even a case here.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.666
The girls withdrew
their complaint.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.972
[Eliot] Yes, your client
paid them off, well done.
Not the first time, is it?

11:09.016 --> 11:13.107
But it is the first time
he's done it in my jurisdiction.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.586
The women won't testify.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.199
-Yes, they will.
-You're going to bully them?

11:18.242 --> 11:20.592
-No.
-[Jackie] They won't tell you
anything.

11:20.636 --> 11:25.206
So, what do you hope to gain?
Explain that to me.

11:26.773 --> 11:30.733
You're not kidding anyone,
Lucas.
You just want the headlines.

11:30.777 --> 11:34.084
If all he wanted was publicity,
Jackie, you wouldn't be having
this meeting.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.608
He'd just take this case
to trial, put your guy away
till the end of days.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.918
-I know you.
-[laughs] Believe me, you don't.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.704
A corporate lawyer
playing as prosecutor.

11:44.747 --> 11:48.011
Cherry-picking the easy cases
so you never lose.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.752
But you don't have
a winner here.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.536
You know,
I'm very fond of you, Jackie,

11:51.580 --> 11:54.148
despite the manner
in which you... took your leave.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.587
-The offer was too good, Eliot.
-Of course.

11:58.630 --> 12:03.810
But your departure left open
a position filled by Lucas,
a godsend, as it were.

12:03.853 --> 12:08.510
So, I would hate to have you go
down the path of those
who've underestimated him.

12:08.553 --> 12:12.949
It's the punch which you don't
see that knocks you out, Jackie.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.822
And I'd prefer that you didn't
spend all that taxpayer money.

12:15.865 --> 12:19.042
Could you at least please
give him a plea offer?
Out of respect.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.653
-Two felonies.
-What?

12:21.697 --> 12:22.829
Minimum seven years.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.179
[laughs] You must be joking.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.746
Chance for parole in half that.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.573
Offer expires at 4 P.M.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.882
This is insanity.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.450
-Eliot, help me out here.
-[Eliot] Okay, Jackie,
here's the thing.

12:35.493 --> 12:39.062
Your client is rich enough to
afford you and your team
and that's peaches for him.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.804
But your client is also
a degenerate sociopath

12:41.848 --> 12:44.938
and if you bring him into court,
my guy here is going to
mop the floor with you.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.983
And that's really not good
for business, is it?

12:47.941 --> 12:48.942
[scoffs]

12:50.465 --> 12:52.206
Could I interest you
in a coffee, Eliot?

12:52.249 --> 12:54.077
That would be wonderful.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.906
Just give me a moment to confer
with my associate, would you?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.256
-I'll be right outside.
-Excellent.

13:07.003 --> 13:10.224
Honestly, I don't think
you can win this one in court.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.269
But I guess it only matters
what he thinks.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.141
You don't take this case
from me, Eliot.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.621
[Eliot] I still think
you don't understand me, Lucas.

13:16.665 --> 13:20.277
I have priorities and my first
one is to settle the
hit-and-run, nice and quiet.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.584
Why?

13:22.627 --> 13:26.240
Because it's a rare thing
when someone powerful
is actually innocent.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.764
There's no moral dilemmas.

13:30.766 --> 13:34.204
In our time together I've stuck
you with cases you didn't want

13:34.248 --> 13:37.294
and taken away some you did,
but have I ever lied to you?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.383
No.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.996
To a hammer,
the whole world's a nail, Lucas.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.781
Put the hit-and-run to bed

13:46.782 --> 13:49.524
and put Jackie's client
where he belongs, okay?

13:49.567 --> 13:51.569
Not that I'm tying
the two together.

13:53.484 --> 13:57.271
Oh, and, um, handle the
hit-and-run in person.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.620
It's much more compassionate.

14:00.187 --> 14:03.059
Alright, just get it done.
But keep the media out of this.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.370
I'll bring you back a coffee.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.285
You're looking a little
under the weather.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.552
[tense music playing]

14:17.595 --> 14:19.510
[Jackie] Be with you
in a second, Eliot.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.122
A quick word, counselor.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.431
[Jackie sighs]

14:27.475 --> 14:31.218
You better come back
with a reasonable offer.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.655
[sighs]

14:35.048 --> 14:38.747
Or I will put your career
in a very dark place.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.753
[thud]

14:52.935 --> 14:56.808
[tense music playing]

15:00.987 --> 15:03.467
You need me to validate
your parking, Jackie?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.435
[tranquil music playing]

15:16.045 --> 15:17.133
[alarm beeps]

16:16.497 --> 16:20.544
[Eliot] We tried, Mr. Cole.
I am sorry.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.547
We gave it our best shot.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.853
No, you didn't.

16:28.465 --> 16:32.121
What your boy did, did not help.

16:32.165 --> 16:35.342
That driver was drunk
and out of control.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.734
That's all
that should've mattered.

16:36.778 --> 16:39.346
It should have.
But we were outgunned.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.956
[Lucas]
But if I got you another--

16:44.351 --> 16:46.744
Well, we don't have
the budget, Mr. Cole.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.051
Won't cost you a thing.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.404
[Eliot]
Sure, I'll talk to him.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.842
You are talking to him.

16:59.670 --> 17:05.720
Mr. Cole, we prosecuted
the case, even though,
I knew we wouldn't win.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.156
What would you have done
differently?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.724
-[Lucas] I would've found a way.
-Really?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.378
-Yes.
-[Eliot] Just like that?

17:12.422 --> 17:13.902
Yes.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.819
Come by my office tomorrow.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.523
The good fight.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.791
[tranquil music playing]

18:17.183 --> 18:19.010
Hey.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.751
-You with the ladies?
-[Christina] Mm-hmm.

18:21.883 --> 18:25.104
[ducks quacking]

18:31.197 --> 18:32.633
[Christina]
Wait with your uncle.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.601
[chickens clucking]

18:48.475 --> 18:49.780
[Christina]
Your dad is here.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.975
-Hey, easy.
-[Johnny] Just wanna go home.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.674
You're supposed to wait
at school, you know.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.894
I got held up at work, okay?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.246
-Just wanna--
-[Lucas] You have your big game.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.858
I don't feel so good. Okay?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.687
Plus, they don't even
want me there.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.472
-[Lucas] That's not true.
-Yeah, right.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.997
Look, maybe you get a hit,
maybe you don't.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.348
But you're going to the game.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.789
[sighs] You drag me out
for one practice all season,

19:41.832 --> 19:44.008
-and now you--
-[Lucas] What did you say?

19:44.052 --> 19:45.445
Nothing.

19:52.669 --> 19:53.801
Wait here, okay?

19:54.758 --> 19:57.370
-Why?
-I have to talk to someone.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.242
-[Johnny] No.
-Just put your uniform on.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.462
[sighs]

20:04.725 --> 20:05.813
I won't be long.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.829
[knocking]

20:26.660 --> 20:29.097
-Mrs. Santiago?
-[Valeria] Who are you?

20:29.140 --> 20:31.795
I'm Lucas Cole
from the D.A.'s Office.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.449
[Valeria]
What do you want?

20:33.493 --> 20:35.277
I need to speak with you
regarding your son.

20:39.847 --> 20:40.935
[sighs]

20:40.978 --> 20:44.982
[speaking in foreign language]

20:48.943 --> 20:52.860
I'm Marisol Santiago. Please.

20:53.730 --> 20:54.949
Thank you.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.223
I have to tell you and I wanted
to tell you in person.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.312
The District Attorney's Office
will not be pursuing

21:10.356 --> 21:12.662
a criminal indictment
regarding your son's accident.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.708
[Valeria] What?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.840
[Lucas]
The Office doesn't believe
it will be successful at trial.

21:16.884 --> 21:20.409
-Why not?
-[Lucas] Many factors.
Mrs. Santiago.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.542
-Like what?
-Many.

21:23.412 --> 21:27.764
Rich woman, poor kid.
What are the other factors
in this case?

21:27.808 --> 21:30.637
I can only discuss
the details of the case
with the boy's mother.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.857
-[Valeria] She's right here.
-I can't. Uh.

21:33.901 --> 21:37.078
Please excuse me,
I'm already late.
Valeria, do you mind?

21:37.121 --> 21:40.081
No, I'll see him out.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.996
I wish I had better news.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.389
A plan for us all.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.565
Thank you for coming, Mr. Cole.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.928
She has such faith.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.670
Lord keep her
from people like you.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.759
What do you gain
protecting a drunk woman?

22:05.802 --> 22:08.544
She wasn't drunk.
If she was, I wouldn't be here.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.286
Well, I was there,
the police station,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.636
when they brought her in.
Where were you?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.421
I wouldn't have known
about the accident then.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.074
[Valeria] And what about her
blood level,

22:17.118 --> 22:18.946
when they tested her
for alcohol?

22:18.989 --> 22:21.557
-Her blood was fine.
-[Valeria] What was the number?

22:23.472 --> 22:26.997
[scoffs] You don't remember?

22:27.041 --> 22:29.260
What the hell kind of a
prosecutor are you?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.919
Your wife must be very proud.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.225
You can go to her now.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.532
Tell her you did
a good day's work.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.316
That's very righteous of you.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.927
Mr. Cole, this is my house
and I want you out of it.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.799
[Lucas] Is-- is that why
you're involved?

22:45.842 --> 22:47.844
-Out.
-Or are you just hoping for a
piece of the civil settlement?

22:47.888 --> 22:51.544
There won't be a settlement,
you think I'm a fool?

22:51.587 --> 22:54.677
Without a criminal conviction,
no attorney will touch
the civil case,

22:54.721 --> 22:57.854
-not on contingency.
-You know your way
around the law.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.291
[Valeria] I've had a lot
to learn since
that boy went to the hospital.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.424
-Did you know he just got out?
-Yes.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.861
Good for you. Two surgeries.

23:04.905 --> 23:08.038
Needs another. No insurance.
You bet I'm involved, Mr. Cole.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.084
Is he your nephew?

23:10.127 --> 23:13.043
I know them from church,
they have no money left,
no place to stay.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.784
[Lucas]
Where's the boy's father?

23:14.828 --> 23:17.308
-Where you people put him.
-[Lucas] What?

23:17.352 --> 23:18.788
[Valeria]
She's visiting him today.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.445
-What's his name?
-[scoffs] Such concern.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.752
The father's name, what is it?

23:25.795 --> 23:28.798
-Mateo.
-It's not my case.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.888
You're telling me you can
remember from almost a year ago?

23:31.932 --> 23:34.064
[Lucas] I remember every case
I ever tried.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.066
You don't even know
the details of this one.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.199
-Here. Now.
-This is not my case.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.375
[sighs]

23:41.985 --> 23:44.901
So, you're just a messenger,
doesn't that clean your hands.

23:46.512 --> 23:49.210
You need to leave now.
I have a three-o'clock class.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.129
[speaking in foreign language]

23:56.086 --> 23:58.654
[speaking in foreign language]

24:06.532 --> 24:08.577
[speaking in foreign language]

24:12.668 --> 24:16.411
[gloomy music playing]

24:18.805 --> 24:22.286
[Mark] I was trying to pull
the ball down the line
to left field.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.463
It just went higher
than I expected.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.769
-How'd you get so good?
-My dad.

24:28.728 --> 24:32.558
-He around?
-No. Away.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.907
What's your dad doing in here?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.911
Talk, I guess.
That's what he does.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.176
Hey, mister,
can you take me to the game?

24:43.090 --> 24:45.396
-Well, I don't think that's--
-[Valeria] Hello.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.661
-[Mark] Can I go with them?
-That's not a good idea.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.489
[Mark] My team's playing
Johnny's.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.360
[Valeria] Your mom wanted to be
there for you, but today--

24:52.403 --> 24:54.231
They could take me.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.756
You can sit in my class
like we discussed.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.932
-What are you studying?
-I teach it.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.237
Do some homework, okay?

25:01.238 --> 25:02.718
But I'm all done.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.374
Let him come with us.

25:07.767 --> 25:08.942
It's alright with me.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.206
Uh...

25:13.163 --> 25:16.602
Listen, about your mother,
I'm sorry--

25:16.645 --> 25:20.083
His grandmother, not my--
Thank you.

25:21.998 --> 25:26.002
I'd like to look into the
boy's father's case.
There maybe grounds for appeal.

25:27.134 --> 25:30.050
You want to do the right thing,
then sure.

25:31.051 --> 25:35.098
[Lucas] I'll try.
It's the best I can do.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.273
Of course.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.928
But the boy's case is over.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.583
A plan for us all.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.933
Maybe I can find you a lawyer
for the civil suit.

25:43.977 --> 25:47.110
Someone willing to work
for nothing upfront.

25:47.154 --> 25:49.112
-[Lucas] Yes.
-I doubt it.

25:52.333 --> 25:56.685
Bring Marcos--
Mark, back by six.

25:56.729 --> 26:02.691
[tranquil music playing]

26:07.217 --> 26:08.567
Alright, guys.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.571
You good, Johnny?

26:13.963 --> 26:17.619
-Be back soon.
-You're not watching?

26:17.663 --> 26:21.667
I'll be there. Just got to do
some things first.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.596
Have a 100 percent attitude,
that's 99 percent of it.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.467
All you need is to keep,
keep the eye on the ball--

26:39.510 --> 26:41.034
[kid 1] Coach, Johnny.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.864
That is one unusual
little fellow.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.735
Alright. You good? Alright.

26:48.389 --> 26:52.611
[tranquil music playing]

27:04.361 --> 27:06.363
[kid 2] [Inaudible]. Whoo!

27:09.062 --> 27:11.238
[Johnny] That's their pitcher?

27:11.281 --> 27:14.328
[speaking in foreign language]

27:18.288 --> 27:19.159
Oh, boy.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.944
[tranquil music playing]

27:34.261 --> 27:35.610
[Umpire] Son, you're out.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.702
[indistinct chatter]

27:53.889 --> 27:56.196
-Strike one.
-[kid 3] This is too easy.

28:00.635 --> 28:03.769
Come on, kiddo,
knock one out! [claps]

28:04.726 --> 28:06.206
[kid 3] Swing.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.511
Strike two!

28:13.648 --> 28:15.476
[kid 3] Get ready.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.176
Strike three. Next batter.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.351
[kid 3] Bye-bye.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.711
It's good to be king.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.888
-[Lucas] Mr. District Attorney.
-Not forever.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.194
Wouldn't worry, no one is
actually challenging you.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.936
[Eliot] And the thrill somehow
wanes.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.721
The heart,
she is a fickle thing.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.853
[scoffs]

28:46.246 --> 28:47.856
Attorney General?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.728
Might test the waters.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.947
Bowing to the will
of the people, as it were.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.644
Their will be done. [knocks]

28:54.776 --> 28:56.865
This defendant got railroaded.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.867
This isn't a courtroom,
spare the melodrama.

28:59.868 --> 29:03.654
[Lucas] One eyewitness at night,
unreliable at best.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.918
-Then why'd you prosecute it?
-I didn't.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.963
[Eliot]
It's not even your case?

29:08.007 --> 29:10.879
Real problem here is
judicial misconduct.
Misuse of hearsay.

29:10.923 --> 29:13.055
-Improper jury instructions.
-Who is the judge?

29:13.099 --> 29:15.449
-[Lucas] Hurzweil.
-Didn't he retire?

29:15.492 --> 29:19.235
I vaguely remember saying
something nice about him
at some function.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.803
Wasn't he always the
one who was always bragging
about his days at Harvard Law?

29:21.847 --> 29:23.283
Yeah.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.372
Dig away,
chew on his bones if you want.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.069
Just tell me this wasn't
a murder case.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.288
Unarmed robbery.

29:29.637 --> 29:30.986
You still haven't told me
why you're involved.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.946
Something I promised.

29:33.989 --> 29:36.122
-Anyone I know?
-Santiago.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.735
-Why is that name familiar?
-[Lucas] It's the boy's father.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.171
From the hit-and-run?

29:42.215 --> 29:44.434
A decent lawyer would crush this
on appeal.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.523
And what are the odds
they'll have a decent lawyer?

29:48.830 --> 29:50.919
Next week. Today, no worries.

29:50.963 --> 29:56.795
As a matter of fact,
Leland Hardt would like us
to stop by later.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.406
-No.
-Not a request.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.365
You got to see this place
to believe it.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.935
Here's the case file,
the hit-and-run.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.719
Now that it's over
it's all yours.

30:08.763 --> 30:12.071
I have a reputation to maintain,
or an image at least.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.942
Can't have anybody insinuating
I did a favor.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.204
But you didn't.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.553
[Eliot] No, of course, not.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.468
But people like to think
the worst of us.

30:18.512 --> 30:19.382
[knocking on door]

30:22.211 --> 30:23.517
You speak to him?

30:23.560 --> 30:25.345
Yes, I did, as a matter of fact,
Jackie.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.956
I told him that your client is
a pillar of the community

30:28.000 --> 30:32.961
and that his multiple and sordid
felonies were mere spasms
of immaturity.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.310
Eliot, this is serious.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.746
Yes, it is.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.313
[Jackie] So like I told you,
you don't have a case.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.749
Talk to that man.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.668
Okay, Lucas, cards on the table.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.804
You drag my guy into court,
I'll make this a nightmare
for you.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.893
-If you try to crucify him--
-I'll take my chances.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.463
Come on, gentlemen,
let's just talk this through.

30:56.506 --> 30:59.031
You talk to the jury,
before they bury him
for his sins.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.076
[Eliot] Not religious,
but very Old Testament.

31:02.034 --> 31:05.080
-We're done here, counselor.
-He's right, Jackie.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.822
You had a plea offer,
you turned it down.
We're going before the people.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.650
-I didn't turn it down.
-[Eliot] I thought you did.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.391
-No.
-Well, it's off the table.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.088
[Jackie] It's not fair.
You said the deal
was good until four.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.221
[Eliot] It's ten after.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.918
Who cares about ten minutes?
We're talking about
justice here!

31:16.962 --> 31:18.920
Well, that's very impressive,
Jackie.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.791
You just get one juror
to buy into that
righteous indignation,

31:20.835 --> 31:22.010
you can force a re-trial.

31:22.054 --> 31:22.924
[Jackie laughs]

31:24.970 --> 31:26.362
Hmm.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.285
I learned more from this man
in my first three months here

31:36.329 --> 31:38.940
than I did in three years
of Ivy League law school.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.115
Like a father to me.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.422
You're a lucky man, Lucas.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.687
You don't mind if I call
the senior partners, do you?

31:46.730 --> 31:47.818
Let them talk with you directly.

31:47.862 --> 31:48.863
[Lucas] No.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.604
-Good.
-[Lucas] No.

31:50.647 --> 31:51.648
What is he saying?

31:51.692 --> 31:53.476
I think he's saying "no."

31:53.520 --> 31:55.304
[Jackie] Eliot, he just doesn't
understand that I need to--

31:55.348 --> 31:57.132
You just touch
one button on that phone,
we go to trial.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.786
-[Jackie] You can't be serious.
-Try me.

31:58.829 --> 32:02.137
Look, I have dinner plans
so, five, four, three--

32:02.181 --> 32:05.401
We take the deal.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.751
-[Eliot] Press conference.
-No.

32:07.795 --> 32:10.232
-[Eliot] Two. One?
-Please, Eliot.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.365
[sighs] You'll recommend
a reduced sentence?

32:12.408 --> 32:14.019
No.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.846
Do I have your word
you'll support early parole?

32:17.413 --> 32:21.156
Eliot, I rely on your
sense of fairness.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.679
Our time together.

32:22.723 --> 32:23.942
Courthouse steps.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.118
[Jackie]
This could damage my--

32:29.034 --> 32:29.991
I rely on your ability--

32:30.035 --> 32:32.124
The steps right soon.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.695
And don't forget that
autograph for my son.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.960
[footsteps retreating]

32:45.920 --> 32:48.096
Did you really want
to go to trial?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.184
I bet you didn't.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.057
Doesn't matter.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.884
Either way, I'm gonna take the
case away from you

32:53.928 --> 32:57.105
because I'm a politically
ambitious son of a gun.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.324
Or haven't you heard?

33:02.893 --> 33:08.551
A press conference
on the courthouse steps,
nice for the image.

33:09.465 --> 33:10.901
And the reputation.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.255
Let's let Jackie
sweat it out a bit, hmm?

33:18.474 --> 33:23.349
â™ª Yes, I was lost

33:23.392 --> 33:27.701
â™ª But now I found

33:27.744 --> 33:28.876
[umpire] Next batter.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.794
[speaking in foreign language]

33:33.837 --> 33:37.537
[indistinct chatter]

33:39.800 --> 33:41.671
[kid 3] Here we go again.

33:47.938 --> 33:51.681
[speaking in foreign language]

33:51.725 --> 33:52.856
[umpire] Strike one.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.774
[kid 3] No batter.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.864
You got nothing.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.823
Strike two.
Come on, Johnny,
at least go down fighting!

34:04.520 --> 34:05.391
[kid 3] Swing.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.697
That's sorta strike three.

34:08.742 --> 34:12.005
[crowd applauding]

34:23.103 --> 34:24.975
[footsteps approaching]

34:30.851 --> 34:35.290
[tranquil music playing]

34:39.989 --> 34:42.341
[birds chirping]

35:01.664 --> 35:02.926
Where is the lady?

35:04.450 --> 35:05.712
Couldn't make it this week.

35:10.543 --> 35:11.587
Okay.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.242
Something new for her?

35:36.525 --> 35:39.224
"Always remember
the power of words.

35:40.529 --> 35:43.880
Words, after all
are more than just heard.

35:44.968 --> 35:48.581
[tranquil music playing]

35:48.624 --> 35:52.106
Down, down beyond
the cloudy and clear..."

35:53.063 --> 35:54.848
Emily.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.329
[Terrence]
"...until your wondering mind's
inner ear,

35:57.372 --> 36:00.070
where goodness and greatness
do battle with fear.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.811
Now a battle--"

36:04.945 --> 36:05.946
That's it.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.303
You write that just this week?

36:15.347 --> 36:16.348
[Terrence]
Yeah.

36:23.485 --> 36:27.968
-You are a poet, Terrence.
-Okay.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.502
Where's the lady?

36:46.073 --> 36:47.335
Couldn't make it this week.

36:51.687 --> 36:52.558
Okay.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.266
-Next Friday?
-[Terrence] Okay.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.231
[Zhao] Can we talk about my
client?

37:15.537 --> 37:20.412
That bank officer is claiming
long-term disability
for a phantom neck injury.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.935
My client's his meal ticket.

37:23.676 --> 37:24.764
I believe in him.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.680
Not the first time for him.

37:27.723 --> 37:28.855
Nothing in the file.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.556
[Lucas] Since this is your
first case, I'll pretend like
you didn't know.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.169
But you don't know why, do you?

37:41.259 --> 37:45.350
That man was four years
a Marine,
two years in harm's way,

37:45.393 --> 37:47.526
a final stint in Germany.

37:47.569 --> 37:51.617
He's walking down the street,
some neo-Nat thugs
get in his face,

37:51.660 --> 37:53.662
and you can guess
what they said.

37:53.706 --> 37:54.794
[Lucas]
No idea.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.713
What the world must
look like to you.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.063
Everyone has a story to tell.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.507
You're still here.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.430
[scoffs] What did you say
to that new public defender?

38:22.474 --> 38:24.911
She looks, what's the word?
Dispirited.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.000
-There's a mistake here.
-No, no, no, no.

38:27.043 --> 38:31.352
There are no mistakes.
Not today.
Today the world is flawless.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.921
-Eliot, I'm gonna need--
-You missed a press conference
for the ages, Lucas.

38:34.964 --> 38:38.054
Tears. Applause.
Ah, it was just embarrassing.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.926
Just absolutely wonderful.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.841
No, no, no, no.
Come on, not today.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.582
-Where's the BAC?
-[sighs]

38:44.844 --> 38:47.586
-What are you talking about?
-The BAC. It's not in the file.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.286
She wasn't drunk,
we already discussed this.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.635
How would you know?

38:54.810 --> 39:00.033
[sighs] She was never tested,
they screwed up.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.818
That's why it's not in the file,
not in the system.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.342
Look, there were
other factors, anyway.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.344
-We could not have won in court.
-We'll see.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.867
-The case is over.
-Like hell it is.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.695
Thanks to you, by the way.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.437
Our office officially dismissed
the charges 20 minutes ago.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.134
The press release went out
under your name.

39:16.441 --> 39:17.964
Anything else gone missing?

39:18.007 --> 39:21.097
[scoffs] It's not missing,
it was never done!

39:23.230 --> 39:24.927
You made the right choice,
Lucas,

39:24.971 --> 39:28.322
and I want you to know
I'm not offended by your tone.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.977
You're going through
a tough time, I know.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.283
We'll just attribute
any nastiness to the booze.

39:35.024 --> 39:37.200
What, you think I don't know?

39:38.854 --> 39:40.160
I'm the District Attorney.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.903
All those investigators
on my payroll,

39:44.773 --> 39:47.472
you don't think I keep track of
what my prosecutors are up to?

39:48.821 --> 39:50.997
So you drink, who cares?

39:51.040 --> 39:54.479
A little during the day,
a little more at night,
I'm not troubled.

39:54.522 --> 39:55.828
You work hard.

39:57.656 --> 40:01.007
Heck, take the rest
of the afternoon.
I'll walk you to your car.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.530
We'll have a drink.
How about that?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.012
Have you seen the kid?

40:07.317 --> 40:11.931
Listen, Lucas, let this one go.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.236
I brought him
to the baseball game.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.108
His team is playing
my son's team.

40:16.675 --> 40:17.806
You should come and meet him.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.157
I'd love to,
but I have a lot of work--

40:21.201 --> 40:22.768
Game was supposed to
be tomorrow,

40:22.811 --> 40:25.074
but they moved it up because of
a storm that's coming.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.164
Right, sure.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.122
[Lucas]
Uh-huh.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.646
Then why are you here?

40:34.606 --> 40:35.737
[chuckles]

40:35.781 --> 40:36.869
Just a game.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.046
[Eliot]
Oh, don't think that.

40:43.615 --> 40:47.140
Run along. Go.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.108
[indistinct chatter]

40:59.152 --> 41:00.545
[shouts]

41:00.588 --> 41:02.416
Take your base!
Take your base!

41:04.505 --> 41:06.725
Hey, hey, hey, you okay, kid?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.248
I'm done.

41:10.946 --> 41:15.255
Okay. Uh, hey, Johnny, listen.
The pitcher's tired.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.649
So, don't swing,
maybe you'll get a walk.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.346
[umpire] Next batter.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.696
Good, good. Okay. Let's go.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.481
Timmy. Where is Timmy?

41:23.524 --> 41:25.483
-Yeah, need you first.
-[Mark] Hey!

41:30.705 --> 41:33.316
-First pitch, you go for it.
-What?

41:33.360 --> 41:35.623
No way he'll walk you,
you're the winning run.

41:35.667 --> 41:39.279
-He won't put you on base.
-Not supposed to swing.

41:40.323 --> 41:42.761
The first pitch will be
right down the middle,

41:42.804 --> 41:44.676
even if he has to throw it
underhand.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.678
-And you have a good swing.
-[Johnny] Really?

41:46.721 --> 41:48.201
Absolutely.

41:48.244 --> 41:49.942
-Just keep your eye--
-Eye on the ball?

41:49.985 --> 41:52.292
[Mark]
No, keep your eye on the bat.

41:52.335 --> 41:54.773
-Huh?
-Swing at the first pitch.

41:54.816 --> 41:57.297
Watch where it hits your bat.
Keep your eyes there.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.907
Next batter.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.692
Go get him.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.781
[crowd cheers and applauds]

42:02.824 --> 42:03.695
[woman 1] Just do it.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.395
[tranquil music playing]

42:08.438 --> 42:12.486
[Paul] Here you go, fellas.
Well, look who bothered
to show up.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.835
What are you doing here, Paul?

42:13.879 --> 42:16.229
I came to see
my grandson's big game.

42:16.272 --> 42:18.579
And what a game, huh, fellas!
You should have seen it.

42:18.623 --> 42:21.843
Last inning, they're down to
their final lap, one run behind.

42:21.887 --> 42:23.497
Man on first.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.632
[indistinct chatter]

42:27.675 --> 42:29.198
[kid 3] Oh, good, it's you.

42:32.245 --> 42:35.988
[suspenseful music playing]

42:37.642 --> 42:38.817
[crowd cheers]

42:38.860 --> 42:42.951
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh!

42:42.995 --> 42:45.475
[all cheering]

42:45.519 --> 42:47.956
That's what I'm talking about,
Johnny!

42:57.226 --> 43:00.142
[cheering continues]

43:02.841 --> 43:06.192
[Paul] Kaboom!
Oh, you should have seen it.

43:06.235 --> 43:09.630
You know when I was your age,
I had a paper route,

43:09.674 --> 43:11.676
delivered papers in the morning
before I went to school.

43:12.764 --> 43:16.637
I was saving my nickels
for bleacher seats
at Yankee Stadium.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.291
It was 1961.

43:18.334 --> 43:20.119
The chase
for the home-run record.

43:20.162 --> 43:21.686
Everybody was cheering
on Mickey Mantle.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.252
Oh, The Mick.

43:23.296 --> 43:25.864
But not me, I was rooting
for Roger Maris.

43:25.907 --> 43:28.649
Number 9, as he wore his hair
in crew-cut,

43:28.693 --> 43:30.259
just like your granddad used to.

43:30.303 --> 43:34.437
Had a sweet swing.
You know, terrific teammate.

43:34.481 --> 43:37.092
-Good man. Responsible.
-[Lucas] We got to get going,
Johnny.

43:37.136 --> 43:43.359
Well, seeing you hit that
made me feel like a kid again,
like I was watching Roger Maris.

43:44.404 --> 43:47.581
Your mother was watching, too.
So proud of you.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.409
Paul, why do you always
have to be such--?

43:49.452 --> 43:51.193
You know I've been watching
baseball for over 50 years.

43:51.237 --> 43:53.805
And I know I've seen
a bigger home run than yours.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.329
But I'll be darned
if I can remember when.

44:00.681 --> 44:01.856
Let's get going, guys.

44:08.733 --> 44:09.908
[Johnny]
Let me help.

44:15.435 --> 44:16.349
Don't need any.

44:16.392 --> 44:18.264
No, I mean I wanna.

44:22.007 --> 44:25.271
[tranquil music playing]

44:25.314 --> 44:27.577
Hey! The ball.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.277
-It hit here.
-Absolutely.

44:46.771 --> 44:47.641
[Johnny]
Whoa.

44:52.559 --> 44:53.560
Nice car.

44:57.651 --> 45:00.654
[tranquil music playing]

45:03.744 --> 45:04.876
Wait here, okay?

45:04.919 --> 45:08.009
[sighs]
Always. Won't be long.

45:08.053 --> 45:09.750
Fine, come in.

45:09.794 --> 45:13.406
-No.
-Johnny, now is not the time.

45:13.449 --> 45:15.060
The game was good,
everything's good, okay?

45:15.103 --> 45:16.409
[cellphone rings]

45:17.758 --> 45:18.803
[sighs]

45:20.413 --> 45:23.285
Yeah? Okay.

45:26.288 --> 45:28.943
Okay. Thanks, Pat.

45:32.338 --> 45:33.469
I won't be long, okay?

45:34.819 --> 45:38.997
-I'm Lucas.
-Chadwick, sir. Dennis.

45:49.790 --> 45:53.359
[Paul] Your mother was watching,
too. I'm so proud of you.

45:53.402 --> 45:55.013
[thunder rumbles]

45:58.494 --> 46:00.496
[Emily] Yeah, Johnny caught
such a big fish,

46:00.540 --> 46:02.411
grandpa was so proud of him.

46:02.455 --> 46:04.283
-We're almost home now.
-[Johnny] Hey!

46:04.326 --> 46:06.676
[thunder crashes]

46:08.417 --> 46:09.592
[crash]

46:11.290 --> 46:15.685
[calm music playing]

46:20.212 --> 46:23.476
Okay. If you would, sir. Lucas.

46:23.519 --> 46:25.217
You're not going in?

46:25.260 --> 46:27.654
Oh, no. Creeps me out.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.839
[Leland]
Lucas Cole.
[laughs]

46:38.883 --> 46:40.623
[Sandrick]
Alert the authorities.

46:40.667 --> 46:43.017
There's another attorney
in our midst!

46:43.061 --> 46:46.455
You know when there is one
lawyer in town
there's no business to be had.

46:46.499 --> 46:50.503
But when there are two lawyers,
there's no end to business.

46:51.547 --> 46:54.812
-Mr. Sandrick.
-Call me Reverend Nat.

46:54.855 --> 46:59.512
Welcome to
my sanctuary, Lucas,
away from prying eyes.

46:59.555 --> 47:01.993
It's the reason
I bought the estate.

47:02.036 --> 47:04.734
Vanity, I'm afraid.

47:04.778 --> 47:06.519
Is that one of the deadly sins,
Reverend?

47:06.562 --> 47:09.087
-Easily forgiven.
-[laughs]

47:10.218 --> 47:11.785
So how'd it go?

47:13.265 --> 47:14.744
Your son's game.

47:16.616 --> 47:18.574
Oh. Fine.

47:18.618 --> 47:23.579
Eliot told me how you left work
early, had to be there.
[laughs]

47:23.623 --> 47:26.495
A man who knows his priorities,
got to respect that.

47:27.453 --> 47:31.196
I have some news,
wanted you to hear it first.

47:31.239 --> 47:35.330
Eliot has decided to pursue
the position
of State Attorney General

47:35.374 --> 47:38.029
and I have chosen
to support his candidacy.

47:38.072 --> 47:38.986
-He's earned it.
-[Leland] Hmm.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.771
That's not why you're here.

47:41.815 --> 47:44.905
I thought we should meet,
face to face.

47:46.472 --> 47:49.605
I believe you should run
for District Attorney,

47:49.649 --> 47:53.827
replace Eliot as he extends
his reach and his grasp.

47:56.961 --> 47:59.398
No answer? [laughs]

48:00.529 --> 48:02.183
Good.

48:02.227 --> 48:04.403
Anyone who agrees too quickly
worries me.

48:04.446 --> 48:07.058
And anyone who says no
is a fool.

48:07.101 --> 48:09.756
Now we know you're no fool

48:10.713 --> 48:13.847
and, standing here with you,
I'm not worried.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.805
You will consider my offer?

48:17.764 --> 48:20.636
-Mm-hmm.
-[Sandrick] A considerate man.

48:20.680 --> 48:22.551
Hmm.

48:22.595 --> 48:25.337
The Reverend came by to offer
Anna some spiritual guidance.

48:25.380 --> 48:29.036
And I had to meet our state's
next Attorney General.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.038
[Leland] Oh, he's on his way.

48:31.082 --> 48:34.128
To say nothing of the
next District Attorney
of this county.

48:34.172 --> 48:36.870
If you so choose.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.395
My boy's waiting in the car,
if you'll excuse me.

48:40.439 --> 48:42.484
Bring him inside, by all means.

48:42.528 --> 48:45.618
[Sandrick] I was saddened,
Lucas, to hear of your loss.

48:45.661 --> 48:51.711
Eliot told me about
the accident, your wife,
terrible tragedy. I'm sorry.

48:53.234 --> 48:56.585
We almost lost Anna,
as you're aware.
A car accident as well.

48:57.499 --> 48:59.458
My wife wasn't under
the influence.

48:59.501 --> 49:01.242
I don't think that's accurate--

49:01.286 --> 49:05.246
Oh, Anna had a few drinks,
a mistake and she knows it.

49:05.290 --> 49:07.161
She hasn't touched a drop since.

49:07.205 --> 49:09.337
Has she seen the boy? Mark?

49:11.470 --> 49:13.428
My wife is devastated.

49:13.472 --> 49:16.127
She is distraught
about the injuries
that young man suffered.

49:19.260 --> 49:20.827
He was crossing
against the light--

49:20.870 --> 49:22.655
That's her version.

49:22.698 --> 49:24.265
-That's the only version.
-[Lucas] Yes, I read the file.

49:24.309 --> 49:26.572
What are we talking about here?

49:26.615 --> 49:29.531
Evidence is missing
from the case files
and from the database as well.

49:29.575 --> 49:32.447
But the police station
keeps hard copies.

49:33.405 --> 49:36.103
Your wife's blood alcohol
content was 0.05.

49:36.147 --> 49:38.323
That's under the legal limit,
Lucas.

49:38.366 --> 49:39.672
I would think
you would know that.

49:39.715 --> 49:41.369
[Lucas]
They also took hair samples.

49:43.415 --> 49:45.243
I thought that might
interest you.

49:47.593 --> 49:50.030
Your wife was high on cocaine.

49:51.118 --> 49:53.164
"High" is an ambiguous term.

49:53.207 --> 49:54.948
High as a kite, is that clearer?

49:54.992 --> 49:57.298
Are you looking to shake down
Mr. Hardt?

49:57.342 --> 49:59.170
[Lucas]
No.

49:59.213 --> 50:00.867
[Sandrick] Then what the hell
is going on here!

50:00.910 --> 50:02.477
It's all right, Reverend.

50:03.957 --> 50:06.438
The case was dismissed,
was it not?

50:07.830 --> 50:09.789
-[Lucas] Yes.
-[scoffs] Resolved.

50:11.791 --> 50:15.795
Mr. Cole is just expressing
Christian concern
for the young man harmed.

50:15.838 --> 50:19.799
And to put us on notice that
he is a prosecutor
to be respected.

50:21.453 --> 50:24.238
Anna and I will
pay the young man a visit
in person.

50:26.110 --> 50:27.502
In due time.

50:29.852 --> 50:34.161
[Eliot] Well, if you're going
to crash, you might as well
aim for something big.

50:34.205 --> 50:36.685
That was a hell of a show.
I just heard.

50:37.077 --> 50:39.993
-You told me to come, here I am.
-Yeah, I wouldn't have if I'd
known you'd be doing that.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.516
-You lied to me, Eliot.
-Not really.

50:43.301 --> 50:46.130
We couldn't have won the case.
Too much firepower
on their side.

50:46.173 --> 50:49.089
Reverend Nat alone would've had
a hundred demonstrators
on the courthouse steps.

50:49.133 --> 50:51.004
He can't play the race card,
not on this one.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.397
[Eliot]
Oh, ye of little faith.

50:53.572 --> 50:55.313
You don't want any part of that.

50:55.356 --> 50:57.445
And drop the wide-eyed-child
routine, doesn't fit you.

50:57.489 --> 50:59.926
Leland Hardt owns a
television network and, brother,

50:59.969 --> 51:02.494
he can bring down the
wrath of God on both of us.

51:02.537 --> 51:04.757
You want to turn your back
on God, fine, I'm with you.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.759
But turn your back on a man
with a TV network? Foolish.

51:06.802 --> 51:09.327
His network is just violence.

51:09.370 --> 51:11.677
-[Eliot]
Save it for the tourists.
-Targeted to kids.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.244
[Eliot]
Not his fault to give them
what they want.

51:13.287 --> 51:15.028
His choice.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.030
If he didn't do it,
someone else would.

51:17.074 --> 51:18.466
And we'd be at their door.

51:19.598 --> 51:21.382
Crazy, insane thing is
that he likes you.

51:21.426 --> 51:23.993
A kindred spirit. Ruthless.

51:24.037 --> 51:26.648
And he wants to support me for
Attorney General, God bless him.

51:26.692 --> 51:27.997
I'll do a hell of a job.

51:29.173 --> 51:30.826
With the occasional favor.

51:33.046 --> 51:34.787
Don't get high and mighty,
not with me.

51:36.745 --> 51:39.966
I've seen you work that
boy-next-door vibe
and your holier than thou manner

51:40.009 --> 51:42.273
and no one sees you coming.
But I knew.

51:43.665 --> 51:46.103
Everybody thought
you wanted to do
something good with your life.

51:46.146 --> 51:47.191
Make things right.

51:48.801 --> 51:52.848
But you wanted blood
and that's why I hired you.

51:52.892 --> 51:54.676
I've seen how you handle cases.

51:54.720 --> 51:58.463
Buddy boy, you would've put the
screws through Christ Almighty.

51:58.506 --> 51:59.551
[groans]

52:05.252 --> 52:06.993
Of course, I could be wrong.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.087
You still hate me for it,
don't you?

52:15.871 --> 52:17.090
Losing that case.

52:19.005 --> 52:21.921
A year to the day, you don't
think I remember? Please.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.185
There you were on my doorstep.

52:26.752 --> 52:29.711
And here you are now, with the
chance to be District Attorney.

52:29.755 --> 52:33.759
But you need those guys.
And they need an answer.

52:35.500 --> 52:38.242
This is the world we're in,
Lucas.

52:39.504 --> 52:43.290
The only question is,
what are you going to do
about it?

52:46.032 --> 52:47.381
I have to go get my kid.

52:50.732 --> 52:52.734
Why don't you stop
or hit off the bottle first?

52:52.778 --> 52:57.217
-You know what--
-We're realists,
you and me, no different.

52:57.261 --> 53:02.527
This is the opportunity, Lucas.
Right here, right now.

53:07.619 --> 53:09.664
Fine, I'll tell them
your answer is no.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.579
Tell them my answer is yes.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.460
[engine starts]

53:23.939 --> 53:27.856
[tense music playing]

53:43.394 --> 53:45.439
Hey, where do you think
you are going, son?

53:45.483 --> 53:46.962
Hey, don't walk away from me
when I'm--

53:47.006 --> 53:47.963
Talking?

53:49.138 --> 53:52.316
Look, I've had a not great day,
alright?

53:52.359 --> 53:55.449
-I don't need this from you.
-Sorry about your day. Dad.

53:55.493 --> 53:58.713
You had to wait in the car
for a few minutes,
what is the big deal?

54:01.803 --> 54:06.025
Hey, I wanted to be
at your game.

54:06.068 --> 54:07.113
Not true.

54:09.333 --> 54:12.727
You don't want me there any way,
I just make you nervous.

54:12.771 --> 54:14.468
Not true.

54:14.512 --> 54:18.298
Well, yeah, you do.

54:18.342 --> 54:19.691
You scared the hell out of me.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.085
Something could have
happened to you.

54:23.129 --> 54:24.304
[Johnny]
You should have been there.

54:25.392 --> 54:27.612
I know, I will. Next time, okay?

54:27.655 --> 54:29.266
-You should have.
-[Lucas] I will.

54:31.137 --> 54:32.573
It wasn't my fault.

54:35.010 --> 54:36.969
-What are you talking about?
-Not my fault.

54:37.012 --> 54:39.319
Johnny, what'd you do?

54:39.363 --> 54:41.408
You drove fast there
this morning.

54:42.670 --> 54:44.150
It wasn't on purpose.

54:44.193 --> 54:46.065
-That's a lie.
-[Lucas] No.

54:48.459 --> 54:49.373
Yes.

54:51.984 --> 54:53.681
I was just messing around
that night.

54:53.725 --> 54:55.422
Look, we don't have to
talk about it, okay?

54:56.510 --> 54:57.990
I don't know why I did it.

54:58.991 --> 55:00.558
It was not your fault, okay?

55:00.601 --> 55:02.299
-How would you know?
-I know.

55:04.257 --> 55:05.302
I know.

55:06.868 --> 55:10.611
I never told, not a soul.

55:10.655 --> 55:16.356
If you hadn't done what you did,
maybe you'd be gone, too.

55:17.531 --> 55:19.446
If I hadn't, maybe--

55:19.490 --> 55:25.583
Hey. Hey. Johnny. Johnny.
Come here.

55:25.626 --> 55:29.717
[tranquil music playing]

55:35.375 --> 55:38.204
[Johnny]
She stopped me. With her arm.

55:41.990 --> 55:45.167
-I miss her.
-[Lucas] Me, too.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.043
It wasn't your fault.

55:55.961 --> 55:57.223
God help me.

55:59.312 --> 56:00.792
Go sit in the front seat,
will you?

56:00.835 --> 56:02.707
I hate that stupid sliding door.

56:09.191 --> 56:10.932
[engine starts]

56:13.065 --> 56:15.372
You know you never told me
what Mark said to you
before you hit your home run.

56:18.592 --> 56:19.680
"Eye on the ball."

56:22.291 --> 56:23.945
You know I don't believe you
for a second.

56:27.688 --> 56:28.820
How would you know?

56:32.084 --> 56:33.259
That's what you said.

56:36.828 --> 56:38.003
How would you know?

56:40.571 --> 56:42.834
-Just leave us alone.
-How would you know?

56:42.877 --> 56:45.402
[Valeria] I must have been
some idiot letting you
take them to the game.

56:45.445 --> 56:46.881
You were there
when they brought her in.

56:46.925 --> 56:48.709
Dumping two ten-year-olds
on their own?

56:48.753 --> 56:52.452
-[Lucas] The lady who hit Mark.
-You think I would have-- What?

56:52.496 --> 56:54.280
Why were you
at the police station?

56:54.323 --> 56:55.934
[Valeria]
What are you talking about?

56:55.977 --> 56:57.936
You said you were there
when they brought Anna Hardt in.

56:59.459 --> 57:01.113
How would you know?

57:01.156 --> 57:04.725
I saw it happen,
reported it to the police.

57:05.987 --> 57:07.467
You witnessed the hit-and-run.

57:07.511 --> 57:09.034
[Valeria]
I gave them the license plate.

57:09.948 --> 57:11.471
Why are you asking now?

57:11.515 --> 57:13.604
Why didn't you ask before?

57:15.606 --> 57:16.824
[door bangs]

57:22.743 --> 57:23.962
You're most welcome.

57:25.006 --> 57:26.965
-How are you, sir?
-Lucas.

57:27.008 --> 57:29.010
[Dennis] I was addressing
the young gentleman.

57:29.054 --> 57:30.490
Fine, sir.

57:30.534 --> 57:31.883
Dennis.

57:32.927 --> 57:34.146
They're in the sanctuary.

57:36.627 --> 57:40.500
"The Civil War"
by Caesar himself.

57:40.544 --> 57:42.154
How does a man read
in this light?

57:43.198 --> 57:46.680
Does he read or just place his
hand on the cover and absorb?

57:49.378 --> 57:52.381
Hey. How you doing, little man?

57:52.425 --> 57:54.166
I need to speak with Mr. Hardt.

57:54.209 --> 57:56.908
Oh, he's, he's checking
in on his wife.

57:56.951 --> 57:59.040
She's feeling a little bit
under the weather.

57:59.084 --> 58:00.694
Let's see if we can find him.

58:00.738 --> 58:03.175
Go ahead,
I'll keep an eye on your boy.

58:03.218 --> 58:05.612
Here in the
Fortress of Solitude.

58:06.613 --> 58:09.007
Makes Hardt feel like
a Roman emperor.

58:09.050 --> 58:11.009
Yeah.
And look what happened to them.

58:15.143 --> 58:19.713
Eliot tells me you have some
concerns about
Hardt's television network?

58:19.757 --> 58:20.714
Don't you?

58:21.933 --> 58:23.369
Are any of us without flaw?

58:24.631 --> 58:27.895
He's a fine man, a man of faith.

58:27.939 --> 58:30.768
What does that mean to you,
"a man of faith"?

58:30.811 --> 58:32.813
Look to Proverbs 3,

58:32.857 --> 58:36.208
"Trust with all your heart
and lean not on your own
understanding."

58:37.252 --> 58:39.037
Nice sentiment.

58:39.080 --> 58:42.083
"Acknowledge Him and He will
make your paths straight."

58:42.127 --> 58:44.608
But for a different world,
don't you think?

58:44.651 --> 58:45.565
Not at all.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.787
What are you looking for, Lucas?

58:49.830 --> 58:53.878
In this world
His hand is everywhere,
and that's the truth of it.

58:53.921 --> 58:55.227
Seek His righteousness.

58:57.098 --> 58:59.100
Are you a righteous man, Nat?

58:59.144 --> 59:01.494
[Sandrick]
I'm a practical man
and in a practical world,

59:01.538 --> 59:03.670
that's the soul of
righteousness.

59:04.628 --> 59:06.281
Are you a practical man, Lucas?

59:08.545 --> 59:12.244
I believe you are. So, let's
talk like practical men and do
away with childish things.

59:12.287 --> 59:13.593
More than one verse.

59:14.725 --> 59:16.161
You're familiar
with Corinthians?

59:17.945 --> 59:20.078
"If I have all faith,
so as to remove mountains,

59:20.121 --> 59:23.037
but do not have love,
I have nothing."

59:23.081 --> 59:24.735
Where did you learn that?

59:24.778 --> 59:26.301
The words or the meaning?

59:27.215 --> 59:28.477
I don't understand.

59:30.349 --> 59:31.568
From someone near to me.

59:37.617 --> 59:39.053
Forgive me for saying this,
Lucas,

59:39.097 --> 59:41.621
but you are so blinded
by what you lost,

59:41.665 --> 59:44.842
you don't appreciate
what you have, and why.

59:44.885 --> 59:46.234
What do you want, Nat?

59:49.020 --> 59:52.110
I need your assurance
that as District Attorney,

59:52.153 --> 59:55.548
you will take a personal
interest in certain cases.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.901
Cases that deserve prosecution.
And conviction.

01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:04.035
And you'll benefit from the
civil settlements that follow?

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.427
As is just.

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.343
Spiritual advisor.

01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:10.737
To the families who sue, yes.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:13.305
-Spiritual?
-The Lord's work.

01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:16.656
Was it the Lord's work,
the tensions you provoked?

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.355
Peoples' passions at time
outrun their reason.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.623
You want to hold me accountable,
Lucas, but you are wrong
to do so.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:30.670
The message, you see,
it takes on a life of its own,

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:33.542
separate from the intentions
of a messenger.

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:34.631
You understand?

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:47.165
Mrs. Hardt.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:50.821
The two-bit lawyer.

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.694
And the other two-bit lawyer.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:57.131
-Anna, please.
-Don't.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.662
[Sandrick]
We are none beyond redemption.

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.577
Though some are close.

01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:17.369
Look at the world, Lucas,
a few lead, the rest follow.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:20.024
A few prosper, most do not.

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:22.200
And you're meant to--

01:01:22.243 --> 01:01:23.897
His will be done.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:29.816
Power and wealth,
for His purpose, and ours.

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:34.255
Your boy back in private school.

01:01:35.909 --> 01:01:38.303
What father doesn't want to do
right by his son?

01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:42.655
-Yes?
-Yes.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.226
[Sandrick]
I think we understand
each other.

01:01:54.188 --> 01:01:57.714
[Eliot] You get that memorized.
Put that bad boy back.

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.541
Okay, now let me ask you
a question.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:06.026
-What's your favorite number?
-Forty-two.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.288
How about a number
less than ten?

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:11.684
Uh, four. Or two.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:12.946
[Eliot]
Two it is.

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:17.734
That is one.

01:02:19.605 --> 01:02:23.174
How much you want to bet
the next card I turn over
is yours?

01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:26.394
-A million bucks.
-You are on.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.276
-Whoa. But you said--
-I said the next card
I turn over.

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:39.799
I didn't say
the next card in the deck.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.235
That's not fair!

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:43.237
Who said the world was fair,
my friend?

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:44.761
-I don't have--
-A million bucks.

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.588
Well, okay,
I won't collect this time.

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:49.417
-But just this once.
-[Lucas] Collect what?

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:53.726
Oh, uh, this young fellow here
owes me a favor, that's all.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:54.771
No, he doesn't.

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:56.642
Okay, he doesn't.

01:02:56.685 --> 01:02:57.991
I've learned not to argue
with him.

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:02.691
Mr. Hardt, you wanted
to meet my son. John.

01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:05.912
A pleasure.
How are you, young man?

01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:07.174
[Johnny] Okay, sir.

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.611
[Leland laughing]

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.135
[Leland] Mr. Cole.

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:14.878
I've come across some new
information that's troubling.

01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:18.142
-[Sandrick] At a cost, I'm sure.
-[Lucas] Yes.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:20.057
[Sandrick]
What's your price this time?

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.710
[Leland]
Reverend, please.

01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:23.408
How can I help you, Lucas?

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:25.932
[Lucas]
You can't.

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:30.197
[Sandrick] Perhaps you
misunderstood me
when we spoke before.

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:33.113
-No.
-If you don't want
my friendship, just say it.

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:35.594
[Lucas]
I don't want your friendship.

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.076
And I don't want your support.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:40.904
[laughing]

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:42.906
Getting a little old to be
all alone, aren't you?

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.256
Not alone.

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.518
[Leland]
What does that mean?

01:03:47.649 --> 01:03:49.347
It means you were right
what you said before.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.004
You know, I couldn't see.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.222
Today I can.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.357
And when I see that boy injured,

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.317
hearing what his mother said
about God's plan,
maybe I'm a part of that.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.451
Hearing those words.
Maybe you're right,

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:09.802
maybe the message can
transcend the messenger.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:15.329
Maybe, this is His way. Here.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.941
Now.

01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:21.248
I think it's time you're heading
back to the office, don't you?

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:25.774
-[Lucas] No.
-[scoffs] Is that right?

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:27.864
I'm resigning. End of day.

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:30.214
[Eliot] Fine, run along.

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.346
My apologies
for bringing him here.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.175
Mr. Hardt, your wife will never
face a criminal trial.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:36.873
And I let that happen.

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:39.832
But I can sue her
for what she did to that boy.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.703
You won't win.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:44.445
Maybe you're right.
But maybe it can be done.

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:49.059
And if you're a betting man,
you best bet it will be done.

01:04:49.102 --> 01:04:50.538
[laughs]

01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:52.845
[Leland]
Please, enlighten us, Lucas.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.499
I'd rather not put the boy
through a trial.

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:56.109
[Sandrick] One in which
you cannot succeed.

01:04:56.153 --> 01:04:59.678
[Lucas] There was an eyewitness.
Don't blame Eliot.

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:01.158
He tried his best.

01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.508
Her testimony wouldn't
hold up on cross.

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:06.337
-[Lucas]
I think you underestimate her.
-This case can't be won, Lucas.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.905
-Come on, Johnny, let's go home.
-[Sandrick] Mr. Cole.

01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:15.302
You have no idea
the pressure I will put on you.

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.956
[Leland]
How much?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.479
Just wait and see, Mr. Hardt.

01:05:18.523 --> 01:05:20.917
I was speaking to Mr. Cole.

01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:29.099
The boy's had two surgeries,
needs a third.
They have no insurance.

01:05:29.142 --> 01:05:30.970
How much money?

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:31.971
[Lucas]
A hundred grand.

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.843
[laughs]

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.716
No.

01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:39.631
[Lucas] And you'll agree to
put your wife in a rehab center.

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.198
Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.026
-Him.
-The man already said no.

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.375
Do you want to offer
a fairer price?

01:05:44.418 --> 01:05:45.985
A hundred twenty thousand.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.160
[laughs]

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:50.207
That's not how you negotiate.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.515
Sixty thousand dollars and Anna
is my concern, thank you.

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:57.779
No, I think Johnny has
got the right idea.

01:05:57.823 --> 01:06:00.434
Hundred twenty thousand.
And I get to pick
the rehab center.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:02.088
Don't want your wife
hitting any more kids.

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:04.395
-Walk away, Mr. Hardt.
-Hundred forty thousand.

01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:06.049
-Well, Lucas,
you'll get your trial.
-[Lucas] One hundred sixty.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:07.702
-But you, you do--
-One hundred eighty thousand.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:09.095
And I'm finished with you,
you won't work in--

01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:10.575
-Two hundred thousand!
-[Lucas] Yes.

01:06:10.618 --> 01:06:13.317
You two, quiet.

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:16.537
You have a deal.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.498
Two hundred thousand dollars.

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:24.067
And you can send Anna to the
Amazon if it will get her clean.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:26.156
You and your wife will go
visit Mark?

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:27.461
-Yes.
-[Lucas] Tomorrow.

01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:30.682
Fine.

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.251
Make out the check.

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:37.515
-What, now!
-[Leland] For the love of God,
Eliot, shut up.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:40.126
[Sandrick] You think you're so
clever, don't you?

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:42.085
No.

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:43.825
Nice payday, though.

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:47.090
Lawyer for the kid,
a third of the settlement.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:48.395
I don't think so.

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:51.833
Oh, I'm very sure.
And so are you.

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.533
You take care now.

01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:57.448
Why don't you let me
handle this, Mr. Hardt?

01:06:57.491 --> 01:07:00.712
Actually, why don't you walk
the Reverend to his car?

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:02.975
And then leave in yours.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:07.066
I cannot imagine I'll be
supporting any candidacy
of yours, Mr. Brennar.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.067
Go ahead.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:13.507
Well, go on. Run along.

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:25.215
Come on, walk with me.

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:32.222
Anna, darling,
have you met Mr. Cole?

01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:34.311
-Yes.
-Excellent.

01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:39.881
Lucas, I do believe you fooled
the good reverend.

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:43.363
But we all see the world
through our own eyes, do we not?

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:46.105
All others a lesser version
of ourselves.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.151
But I hold no illusions.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.850
Although I must confess
to a little bit of envy.

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:55.854
And that, I am quite sure,
is one of the deadly sins.

01:07:57.725 --> 01:08:02.121
A man who finds the freedom
to live his own beliefs.

01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:04.558
A man like that can do wonders.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:08.910
And what about you?

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:13.176
Indeed. What about me?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.050
-You have the power to do
whatever it is you want.
-Hmm.

01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:20.879
But not the freedom.

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:25.231
I'm too far down this path
to find another.

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.495
I think you know
that isn't true.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.542
[chuckles]

01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:36.676
What I know,
what I know I'll do,
two very different things.

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:40.594
But at least I'm honest
about it, that's got to be
worth something.

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:47.906
I spend my time with charlatans
like the Reverend Nat and worse.

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:52.475
As much as I hate to
work with them, I'm not ready
to fight against them.

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:57.437
Not today.
Perhaps tomorrow.

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:02.529
Your son seems like
a very nice young man.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:06.054
-God bless his mother.
-Hmm.

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:08.318
And I wouldn't underestimate
his father.

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:12.538
Are you serious about a run
at District Attorney?

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:14.759
Yes.

01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:17.501
Oh.

01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:20.243
I very much hope you win.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:25.291
But I will do whatever is
necessary to see to it
that you do not.

01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:28.468
I trust you understand.

01:09:30.209 --> 01:09:31.167
[Lucas]
Mm-hmm.

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:38.304
[Leland]
Shall we conclude our business?
To whom shall I write the check?

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.481
Make it out to "Cash."

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:46.573
[tense music playing]

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:47.966
Of course.

01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:57.367
[tranquil music playing]

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.200
[sighs]

01:10:10.815 --> 01:10:14.819
Your trunk was open,
didn't think you'd mind.

01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:19.650
How's my partner in cards?

01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:21.652
Wait in the car.

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:25.221
Car. Please.

01:10:29.616 --> 01:10:31.923
[Eliot]
There by the grace of God.

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.141
[Lucas]
Something like that.

01:10:36.057 --> 01:10:38.277
Well, you certainly sold the man
in there a bill of goods.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.627
[Lucas] Not interested
in the man in there.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:46.807
So, um, why don't you, what,
what's his word, enlighten me,

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:49.419
what it is you're getting at.

01:10:49.462 --> 01:10:51.812
Quote me something profound,
or was that all you knew?

01:10:54.206 --> 01:10:55.816
No, I'm not the one
to blame here.

01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:05.348
If I were Attorney General,
imagine all the good
I could have done?

01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:12.529
I treated you like a son, and--

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:16.881
[sighs]

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:22.147
Don't forget after tomorrow
you're just another lawyer.

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:25.498
-Yeah.
-Hustling out there like
the rest of them.

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:27.544
[Lucas]
Mm-hmm.

01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:35.900
Who knows,
maybe you'll fool everyone,

01:11:35.943 --> 01:11:39.382
[gloomy music playing]

01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:41.297
keep all that money
for yourself.

01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:57.095
One person who could have
ruined this for me

01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:00.185
and I dragged you into it.

01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:06.104
Now why would I do that?

01:12:17.158 --> 01:12:19.465
[car engine starts]

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:29.301
[gloomy music playing]

01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:51.932
So, you still remember
where I live, huh?

01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:54.544
What are doing here?

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.983
I should have been there
that night.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.771
Should have been me driving.

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:07.165
I got held up at work.

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.210
I'm so sorry.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:11.865
[sighs]

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:16.957
-Come in.
-[Lucas] Uh, I can't.

01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:21.179
Johnny's in the car, waiting.

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.620
[sighs]

01:13:27.664 --> 01:13:28.621
Listen.

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:32.277
All those things I said--

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:39.719
Uh, you understand,
a loss like that,
man's got to blame somebody.

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.547
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:50.643
Maybe not.

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:56.910
You wanna join us?

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.481
Next time.

01:14:05.658 --> 01:14:06.703
All right.

01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:11.185
Like to hear that from you.

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:14.450
[scoffs]

01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:20.151
[clears throat]

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:25.678
[car door opens then closes]

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:28.899
What do you want now?

01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:30.466
-[Lucas] Is Mrs. Santiago in?
-No.

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:32.468
-Do you know where she is?
-[Valeria] Yes.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:33.643
He shouldn't be in jail.

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:37.821
-Mark's father.
-What about him?

01:14:37.864 --> 01:14:40.998
He can win on appeal.
He just needs a decent lawyer.

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.348
One who will work for free,
that's all.

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.045
[Lucas]
I can give you a name.

01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:47.221
Why would anyone take the case
for nothing?

01:14:48.135 --> 01:14:49.746
Well, he's a bit of a fool.

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.922
-[Valeria] Who?
-Me.

01:14:51.965 --> 01:14:53.663
-Very funny.
-[Lucas] Is it?

01:14:53.706 --> 01:14:55.447
Mr. Prosecutor.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.275
Not after today.

01:14:57.318 --> 01:14:59.233
-You were fired?
-I quit.

01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:01.584
But I would have been fired,
yeah.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:05.196
Uh, do you know where she is?

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.114
I don't think I believe you.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:20.994
[Lucas]
Have her call me.

01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:24.258
What in God's name
are you talking about?

01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:27.610
It's the settlement
from Mark's civil suit.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:28.741
How is that possible?

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:33.877
I'm Mark's new lawyer.
He just doesn't know it yet.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.879
That check is made out
to "Cash."

01:15:35.922 --> 01:15:39.447
-What does his new lawyer get?
-[Lucas] Everything.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:42.407
You're keeping all the money?

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:44.670
I'm keeping none of it.

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:55.855
I'll take you to Mark.

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.861
[footsteps approaching]

01:16:09.739 --> 01:16:11.175
[cellphone rings]

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:13.003
Make a right
out of the driveway.

01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:17.573
Hello? No, not going back.

01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.314
Uh, where are we going?

01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.928
Are you okay?

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:26.973
12 Prospect Street.

01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:28.366
Did you hear that?

01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:32.152
[tranquil music playing]

01:16:35.503 --> 01:16:37.462
[car rumbles]

01:16:48.995 --> 01:16:51.476
My client accepts your deal.

01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:53.043
You're willing to plead guilty,
Mr. Sensabaugh?

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:54.174
Yes, he is.

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.785
Allow him to answer for himself.

01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:58.483
To confess to what
you swore you didn't do.

01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:01.094
What do you want, Mr. Cole?
He said yes.

01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:03.009
[Lucas]
No. He didn't.

01:17:03.053 --> 01:17:04.663
Sign it?

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.622
He's agreed to.
He'll sign it now.

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:08.406
Did you hurt the man?

01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.930
-Did you?
-[Zhao] Leave him alone,
Mr. Cole.

01:17:10.974 --> 01:17:12.758
Who do you think you are?

01:17:12.802 --> 01:17:14.804
I'm the Assistant District
Attorney of this county.

01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:17.328
For the next few minutes anyway.

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:19.635
Did you hurt the man, Peter?

01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:22.638
No.

01:17:24.727 --> 01:17:26.990
Deal's off.

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:29.035
-You can't do that.
-Yes, I can.

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:30.863
That's not fair.

01:17:30.907 --> 01:17:33.692
It's more than fair. It's just.

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.868
What does that mean?

01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:37.740
It means you just won
your first case, counselor.

01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:43.876
[gasps]

01:17:46.618 --> 01:17:48.881
[laughing]

01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:57.977
-[Valeria] You always this
popular?
-[Lucas] It's an unusual day.

01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.722
[Valeria]
Thank you.

01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:09.206
[tranquil music playing]

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:12.426
Scene one, take one.
[Inaudible] slate.

01:18:20.652 --> 01:18:22.088
Can we do that again?

01:18:23.655 --> 01:18:25.396
[man 2]
Still rolling.

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:49.855
[crowd cheers]

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:10.441
God help me.

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:11.964
Not alone.

01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:14.924
[Valeria] What does his
new lawyer get?

01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:15.968
Everything.

01:19:17.056 --> 01:19:18.405
Alright.

01:19:18.449 --> 01:19:21.147
[all laugh]

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:28.372
[tranquil music playing]

01:19:41.733 --> 01:19:45.824
[music stops playing]

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:56.563
-[man 3] [Inaudible] ready?
-Mm-hmm.

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.523
I'm just in cha--
I'm just getting into character.

01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:00.741
[man 3]
Good.

01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:05.616
[tranquil music
continues playing]
