00:38.338 --> 00:40.431
I respectfully disagree.

00:45.445 --> 00:48.573
Two plus two equals four
because we agreed upon it.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.308
Which doesn't make it true.
It is a concept.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.714
Two plus two equaling four
is a primal equation.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.321
Man didn't create it.
We discovered it.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.949
Like it or not,
there are natural patterns...

00:59.125 --> 01:01.423
...and things will always happen
a certain way.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.628
Oh, be careful with always.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.926
Oh, when I say always, I figure
it's a given 99 percent of the time.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.662
Oh, so you are agreeing
that there are exceptions to your rules.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.068
Of course,
but the virtue of the exception...

01:14.240 --> 01:15.730
...is that it proves the rule.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.803
Let's be thankful
that the greatest artists...

01:19.979 --> 01:21.913
...to ever live would not agree.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.418
They're confined to four rules.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.985
You don't paint past here...

01:28.154 --> 01:30.952
...here, here or here.

01:31.124 --> 01:35.493
You know, I'd be so bold to say
that there can be no art without rules.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.363
Are you gonna put that out
before they put you out?

01:45.538 --> 01:46.664
It's against the law.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.865
- Is it bothering you?
- I hate smoke.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.739
Good enough.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.750
What are you drinking?

01:58.918 --> 02:01.148
Well, I was drinking red wine.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.312
- You like red?
- I do.

02:05.525 --> 02:06.856
I'll make you something red.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.325
What do you do?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.405
I work in the man--

02:20.573 --> 02:22.905
I work in the brand-management
business.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.469
And what would you do
if you didn't do that?

02:27.647 --> 02:29.672
That's a good question.

02:29.849 --> 02:33.012
I don't think the bartender
likes the fact you're doing his job.

02:34.954 --> 02:39.084
Let's see what he says,
if he will act on his unhappiness.

02:49.269 --> 02:52.500
Did anyone ever tell you Michael
is an unusual name for a woman?

02:53.206 --> 02:55.538
Oh, that's a long story.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.006
Let's start with a shorter one.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.907
Okay.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.374
What do you do?

03:04.584 --> 03:06.279
What I want.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.590
Julian.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.629
- Hi, handsome.
- Hey.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.893
Sorry I'm late. Not a good impression
for our first official date.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.469
That's fine. Brenda, this is Michael.

03:25.638 --> 03:26.662
Michael, Brenda.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.137
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.072
Oh, no, please.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.613
I wouldn't be a gentleman if you had
to pay for your own Shirley Temples.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.774
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.044
Thank you.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.417
- It was very nice meeting you, Brenda.
- Oh, take care.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.354
God, she's gorgeous. Where
do you two know each other from?

03:48.528 --> 03:50.462
I don't. We just met.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.789
Well, traffic was a mess.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.299
They're saying that the freeways
are going to be totally gridlocked.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.266
- Who's they?
- What?

03:58.438 --> 04:00.429
You said they. Who's they?

04:00.607 --> 04:02.006
They reported it on the news.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.040
I wouldn't believe
everything they say...

04:04.210 --> 04:06.201
...especially
if you don't know who they is.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.404
- Even the news?
- Especially the news.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.980
- Oh, come on.
- Shall we?

04:10.149 --> 04:11.810
Sure.
What do you wanna do tonight?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.714
I don't know, we'll figure something.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.353
- Well, I have a few ideas.
- Yeah?

04:16.522 --> 04:17.921
And one of them is...

04:18.091 --> 04:22.255
...how about we do
whatever you want me to.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.359
Oh, my God. Julian.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.764
Don't stop. Just like--

04:30.937 --> 04:31.995
Don't stop.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.433
Don't stop. Don't stop.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.630
Don't you stop--

04:44.150 --> 04:46.641
Oh, my God. Julian?

04:46.819 --> 04:47.945
Julian, are you okay?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.679
Me...

04:50.189 --> 04:53.681
Oh, my God. My God.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.488
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

04:56.663 --> 04:59.097
- Just, just...
- Okay, okay.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.191
Fuck.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.661
Oh, fuck.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.604
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.669
What can I do for you?

05:10.843 --> 05:12.708
You should probably go.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.816
I think a lot of people
have been getting the flu.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.149
I hope you don't get really sick.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.700
- Honey, are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

05:36.869 --> 05:37.893
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.868
If you need anything,
will you call me?

05:40.039 --> 05:41.063
Thanks.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.333
- Call me if you need anything--
- Okay, I will.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.875
I'll come right back, okay?

05:46.612 --> 05:47.636
I'm sorry.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.305
No, no, no. It's okay.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.348
I hope you feel better.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.910
Get better.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.758
<i>Hey, it's Lynn Wright.</i>

06:42.935 --> 06:45.529
<i>I'm not here right now,</i>
<i>but I'll get back to you.</i>

07:33.052 --> 07:35.247
- Did E.J. tell you what this is about?
- No idea.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.445
No, me neither.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.487
It's Praylis.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.182
- Bullshit.
- No, it is.

07:40.359 --> 07:42.953
Stand up. You're about to see
what real dicks look like.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.756
- Oh, my God.
- What's with your hand?

07:44.931 --> 07:45.955
Nothing.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.759
- Praylis is here.
- They know, Greg.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.267
That's Mr. Praylis to you, Greg.
Here you go.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.696
- Larry, tie, tie, tie.
- Good luck.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.834
All right, here we go.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.739
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
Larry Green, our firm's top counsel.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.009
Morning.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.244
- Julian Wright, our chief strategist.
- Hello.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.513
Mr. Praylis, you know.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.055
And his representatives
from the Praylis Group...

08:12.225 --> 08:14.318
...Mr. Clark and Mr. Franklin.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.089
Did I get all those names right?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.124
You'd think
I'd be better at that by now.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.359
Okay.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.566
- May I?
- Please.

08:26.372 --> 08:31.332
The Praylis Group is looking
to consolidate its creative premium...

08:31.811 --> 08:35.577
...by absorbing a boutique company
like ourselves into the fold...

08:36.182 --> 08:38.582
...to manage all of their brands.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.852
Now, where we need
the most assistance...

08:44.023 --> 08:46.082
...is with our older brand identity.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.251
Which has been misaligned
in trying to target a different market.

08:49.428 --> 08:51.896
We've lost resonance
in our established market...

08:52.064 --> 08:55.090
...along with brand-equity
in those products in the last year.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.862
- You're referring to your detergents?
- Exactly.

08:58.037 --> 09:02.133
Which are all iconic products
in the American marketplace.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.373
You built those brands
on the strength of American ideals.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.638
On quality and dependability.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.508
Consumers still value those ideals.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.741
How they represent,
experience the product...

09:11.918 --> 09:13.886
...must be more contemporary
and relatable.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.613
Sell the contemporary culture
you already represent.

09:16.789 --> 09:17.949
America has a new face...

09:18.124 --> 09:20.888
...but no specific culture
in which to experience it.

09:21.060 --> 09:25.793
Americans buy ideas that represent
who they want to be, not the product.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.273
I'm only considering two companies
to bring into the Praylis fold.

09:35.441 --> 09:38.342
This one,
and the Innovative Identity Group.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.742
In three weeks, both companies
will come together in the same room.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.973
Pitch against one another
their strategies...

09:44.150 --> 09:46.675
...on how to reposition and rebuild
our older brands...

09:46.852 --> 09:49.582
...as well as how to maintain
our newer brands.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.723
The company
with most appealing strategy...

09:51.891 --> 09:53.859
...will be absorbed
by the Praylis Group...

09:54.026 --> 09:57.018
...and given an account of $5 billion
over the next five years...

09:57.196 --> 09:58.788
...to oversee all marketing.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.226
You have till the end of the day...

10:01.400 --> 10:03.698
...to let us know
if you accept this proposition.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.534
Okay. We'll speak soon.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.977
You're aware I'd like to prepare
a preliminary deal before presentation.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.342
Of course.
We'll wait to hear from you.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.006
- Good day.
- Pleasure to meet you.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.779
- Good to meet you.
- Good to see you.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.394
Oh, my God.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.498
All right, I'm sure we have 5 billion
things to talk about. Call me later.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.571
Never told me
you were thinking of selling.

10:39.739 --> 10:43.800
Well, they offered me
$35 million to buy me out.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.376
And you, as the head
of his Creative Department...

10:46.545 --> 10:50.811
...are gonna be running
a $5 billion account.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.207
Excuse me?

10:57.356 --> 10:59.790
I'm retiring, Julian.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.652
You're gonna be running Creative
at Praylis.

11:02.828 --> 11:06.491
They've already agreed
to give you a 20 percent partnership...

11:06.666 --> 11:08.327
...as soon as you deliver.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.062
And I, of course, will have
a nice little share of that as well.

11:13.205 --> 11:14.900
Oh, my God.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.934
Well, I wasn't expecting this.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.042
You just weren't expecting it
quite so soon.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.407
I don't know how to thank you.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.275
Yes, you do. Win.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.111
Sit down.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.120
Look, I know you know this...

11:34.293 --> 11:37.228
...but the Praylis Group
is an extension of their consumer.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.886
They're a family business.

11:39.065 --> 11:42.592
And they're run
on American family values.

11:42.768 --> 11:47.865
So if we do this, we will be expected
to adopt those same values.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.564
Of course.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.609
You'd have to postpone your divorce
until we settle this deal.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.441
Can you do that?

11:56.615 --> 11:58.105
I could.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.817
Any chance at a reconciliation?

12:02.421 --> 12:03.445
Nope.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.223
Nope. All right.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.950
I didn't think so.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.118
All right, we'll just have to...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.493
We'll go very carefully with this.

12:16.969 --> 12:20.063
So congratulations and yippee...

12:20.239 --> 12:23.003
...and balloons and blow jobs
and confetti and shit.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.837
But what does this mean
for the rest of us, huh? Come on.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.876
Blow job, please.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.641
Look, guys, the reason I brought you
all here tonight...

12:31.817 --> 12:34.479
...is I wanna assure you
that no matter where I go...

12:34.653 --> 12:37.645
...you're all coming with me,
whether you like it or not.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.484
Nice.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.250
Well, I'm gonna be honest.

12:41.427 --> 12:46.023
I am not crazy
about the possibility of Praylis...

12:46.198 --> 12:49.224
...and their soap
being our only client.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.426
- That's boring to me.
- Oh, Cheryl.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.868
The opportunities are endless
with this setup.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.371
- Right? Thank you very much, Larry.
- Yeah.

12:56.542 --> 13:01.036
Oh, and, hey, I have got
an ex-girlfriend from college...

13:01.213 --> 13:04.011
...that's working
at Innovative Identity Group.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.584
- You know, we can just--
- Greg.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.276
- Just kind of--
- Greg.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.580
No.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.724
- So let's say this actually happens.
- Which it will.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.951
- Will there be promotions?
- Of course.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.358
But, Cheryl, I'm sorry.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.159
You get a big raise,
but you're stuck with me.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.365
Can't make it without you.

13:23.769 --> 13:24.997
That's really cute.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.866
- Nice. Thank you.
- Look at that.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.166
Strangely enough,
that's exactly how I want it.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.774
- Call me crazy.
- Yeah, crazy.

13:30.943 --> 13:35.004
Well, here's to good times
we've had.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.580
- Yes.
- And great times to come.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.842
- Yeah. Cheers.
- Thank you.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.315
You can't toast with water, dude.
It's bad luck.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.787
- I'm on the clock, Larry.
- I am too.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.951
Unless anyone else has got anything
to add, it is Friday night after all.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.494
I'll see you all Monday.

13:51.697 --> 13:54.894
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna see
if I can catch anyone at Serenade.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.127
- It's Bobby's birthday. You coming?
- Nope, I'm gonna do some work.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.430
Come on. Come with us.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.072
You've got to celebrate.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.867
I'll be celebrating in my own way.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.509
Julian, let me talk to you.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.871
Yeah.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.471
What happened with Brenda?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.344
Is everything okay?

14:13.452 --> 14:16.444
- What do you mean what happened?
- She called Tracey.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.648
My wife, being who she is,
was chatty about it.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.816
I know Lynn
just sent the paperwork through.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.928
So I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

14:24.096 --> 14:27.259
I'm fine, Larry. I'm fine.
It's been a year.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.599
You're right. I know.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.498
Of course it has. Life goes on.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.639
Well, look, congratulations.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.139
Get some sleep, you look like shit.
See you Monday.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.944
- I will. Okay.
- Okay.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.515
Ma, it's me.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.348
Ma.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.702
Ma?

15:06.572 --> 15:07.903
Fuck.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.684
Ma?

15:32.431 --> 15:33.523
Ma.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.030
Oh, my heavens.

15:38.804 --> 15:43.366
What? Julian, my heavens,
what are you doing?

15:43.943 --> 15:47.037
I was calling you.
You didn't answer me.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.509
Well, I couldn't hear you.

15:48.681 --> 15:52.208
I was listening to the Lord's message
on this little box you gave me.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.148
Well, perhaps you shouldn't
listen to it so loud.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.246
I guess.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.284
You look tired, honey.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.323
You working a lot?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.492
I got a lot of things happening.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.391
That's really great.

16:07.032 --> 16:10.092
So let me show you
what I called you about.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.736
- Okay.
- Come on.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.895
What, you couldn't tell me
on the phone?

16:14.073 --> 16:16.906
I didn't wanna tell you.
I just wanna show you.

16:18.677 --> 16:21.373
Can you believe you slept in here?

16:23.449 --> 16:25.246
Time flies.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.785
I look at you now
and I wonder how you even fit in here.

16:31.223 --> 16:34.659
I remember
you were the sweetest little boy.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.723
I remember you used to love to run
around the neighborhood naked...

16:38.897 --> 16:41.889
...and I couldn't catch you.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.762
You really scared me.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.904
Really scared me.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.732
<i>Mom.</i>

16:48.640 --> 16:50.267
Mom.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.548
Hey, Mom.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.989
<i>Mommy?</i>

17:07.559 --> 17:09.083
<i>Mom.</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:13.490
<i>Oh, my God, Mom.</i>

17:17.236 --> 17:19.761
Anyway, I didn't realize
how many things you left here.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.065
It's almost as if you never did leave.

17:22.241 --> 17:25.368
There are probably some items
you would like to take with you.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.341
Where are my things?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.577
Oh, you weren't listening,
were you?

17:33.752 --> 17:36.846
I told you, Mr. Frank
put everything up in the attic.

17:37.022 --> 17:38.080
Yeah.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.817
You know,
I just want my living room back.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.928
I thought we could turn this
into a playroom for your nephews...

17:44.096 --> 17:47.327
...and paint it colors bright and happy,
you know.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.834
- Well, you know what I think.
- What's that?

17:50.002 --> 17:52.664
I think Rita and the boys
should just move in here, Ma.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.898
- Rita and the boys are here enough.
- Okay.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.110
But I'll call Mr. Frank.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.809
Well, no, this is really your job.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.851
Ma, weren't you listening?
I don't have time to do this.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.080
I think you have to make some time,
son.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.747
Mr. Frank will be much faster.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.626
When did family become such
an inconvenience for you, Julian?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.565
Throwing your money around...

18:25.737 --> 18:28.797
...you think that makes you a man
and keeps a family?

18:29.408 --> 18:33.344
I would have thought that losing
your wife would have taught you that.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.173
Well, I guess not.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.847
You keep your money.

18:40.919 --> 18:44.184
I expect you to start painting this room
as soon as possible.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.483
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Okay.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.456
Preparing dinner.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.059
- What's that?
- It's...

18:58.103 --> 18:59.661
It's nothing.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.004
And stay for dinner, if you want.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.874
Okay.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.508
- Stay down, stay--
- Everything okay, Karami?

20:11.677 --> 20:13.645
Oh, good morning, Mr. Wright.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.804
Saturday morning, sir.
Don't you ever rest?

20:17.482 --> 20:18.813
You crack me up, man.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.010
Yeah, listen, Greg. Can you e-mail me
those Praylis projections again?

20:46.178 --> 20:47.907
Yeah, I wanna go over them.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.275
I don't know.
Just something isn't right.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.781
No.

20:52.951 --> 20:54.976
No, I did read that. Yeah.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.657
I'm gonna call you back.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.884
Don't do it, Victor. Don't do it.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.000
Oh, honey, please, get your own.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.699
This is my bottle.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.349
Can I help you with?

21:58.517 --> 22:00.144
- Julian.
- Oh, my God.

22:01.953 --> 22:03.477
What are you doing here?

22:03.655 --> 22:07.147
I left my cape and teeth at home,
but I wanted to see a movie.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.323
What? You introduce me?

22:14.966 --> 22:15.990
Oh, my--

22:16.168 --> 22:19.934
Okay. Julian, this is everybody.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.436
Everybody, this is Julian.

22:21.606 --> 22:22.971
- Hi, everybody.
- How are you?

22:23.141 --> 22:24.608
Hi.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.971
- Can I sit?
- You wanna stay?

22:27.145 --> 22:28.578
Love to.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.146
She's Thalia.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.709
Nice to meet you.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.377
Yeah, hi. Nice to meet you.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.685
What are we watching?

22:42.728 --> 22:45.060
This is my favorite, <i>Frankenstein</i>.

22:45.230 --> 22:46.857
- <i>Frankenstein</i>.
- Yes.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.131
Would you care for a glass of wine?

22:54.306 --> 22:55.773
I'd love one. Thank you.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.539
Oh, spare.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.055
- Did you like it?
- I did.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.962
I've always loved this movie.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.134
It is hilarious.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.739
So this is your idea of a good night?

23:30.942 --> 23:33.410
You Americans, I mean,
your obsession with goodness.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.806
What?

23:35.514 --> 23:39.780
Goodness is only a requirement
for acceptance, not greatness.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.879
How so?

23:42.687 --> 23:44.917
So take Dr. Frankenstein.

23:46.291 --> 23:51.194
He creates a monster that he rejects,
because the monster mirrors himself.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.457
Therefore, the monster
becomes angry and disruptive...

23:54.633 --> 23:58.501
...until the doctor looks at the monster
and finally sees himself.

23:59.237 --> 24:02.968
Only then is his greatness restored.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.939
I better watch that film again.

24:10.248 --> 24:13.615
We must always be
who we really are...

24:13.785 --> 24:18.950
...even in the chaos,
for that is where we create.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.489
Michelle.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.387
- He's talking to you?
- I'll be right back.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.899
I thought we were done with him.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.509
Hey.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.310
Get your hands off her.

24:45.183 --> 24:48.209
Julian. It's okay.
I just need to talk to him.

24:49.521 --> 24:50.545
Hey.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.182
Jesus Christ.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.849
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Don't hit people.

24:56.027 --> 24:58.928
- Holy shit.
- Good Lord.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.155
He's out cold.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.324
But we're okay. Thank you.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.833
Everyone can go now.

25:05.570 --> 25:08.130
- All right, guys, let's move him.
- No, don't touch him.

25:08.607 --> 25:10.370
He's probably got a concussion.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.909
Just someone call 911,
and get some ice.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.376
- Ice?
- Yes.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.676
Okay, let's go get some fucking ice,
all right?

25:18.850 --> 25:21.284
- Ice. Okay, sure.
- We'll be back.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.689
This is fucking ridiculous.

25:45.777 --> 25:49.110
Just drive slowly. No, it's fine.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.122
Were you a Boy Scout?

26:03.295 --> 26:05.092
That's very funny.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.560
So who is Frenchie?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.363
Joseph.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.298
Well, I got that part.
But who is he to you?

26:13.438 --> 26:14.871
A friend.

26:15.874 --> 26:18.468
A friend you're dating or?

26:19.277 --> 26:20.767
No.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.140
Someone you used to date?

26:23.148 --> 26:26.208
- Something like that.
- Something like that.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.085
You hit him pretty hard.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.983
I did.

26:32.557 --> 26:35.617
I feel like I'm supposed to feel bad.

26:37.228 --> 26:38.889
But I don't.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.335
Where do you live?

26:54.379 --> 26:55.403
Where is your house?

26:55.580 --> 26:57.741
- Where's my house?
- Yeah.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.750
Okay.

27:04.689 --> 27:07.123
Okay, just--

27:08.827 --> 27:11.159
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.491
I wrap it for now,
but you might need stitch too.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.600
Yeah, it's...

27:18.737 --> 27:20.261
Okay.

27:20.605 --> 27:23.335
Can you hold here? Yeah.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.302
Okay.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.203
Perfect.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.882
Okay.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.575
Let me see.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.148
- You want a drink?
- No.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.552
I don't drink alcohol.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.555
Your book collection's impressive.

27:43.728 --> 27:46.026
Have you read all of them?

27:46.197 --> 27:47.926
Most of them.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.199
You looking for anything
in particular?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.373
Did you decorate it yourself?

27:58.410 --> 27:59.968
Interesting.

28:06.217 --> 28:09.584
Oh, no, that's far enough.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.346
What's in there?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.219
All right, give me the key.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.221
Why?

28:16.861 --> 28:18.829
What's in there? What is it?

28:18.997 --> 28:20.794
A dark room.

28:20.965 --> 28:23.433
- Oh, you take pictures.
- I do.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.796
Important ones, I guess.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.195
- Open it.
- No.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.807
- Why?
- Because.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.071
Because what?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.077
Where is your camera?

28:37.248 --> 28:38.408
Why?

28:38.583 --> 28:40.813
You are going to take
pictures of me.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.413
No, I'm not.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.020
Yes, you will.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.598
Get your camera.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.081
I want to know
what kind of pictures you take.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.941
See how you see me.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.771
You ever wonder
what is happening...

29:39.944 --> 29:43.971
...at each one of those shiny
streetlights in the distance?

29:45.884 --> 29:49.752
Who, at that moment,
is standing by that twinkling glow?

29:50.622 --> 29:55.355
And does their life
mirror your life in any way?

29:56.861 --> 29:58.294
Or...

29:59.230 --> 30:01.061
...are we really alone?

30:27.492 --> 30:29.187
What happened?

30:37.168 --> 30:38.829
What do you see?

31:03.795 --> 31:08.357
My mother was a concert pianist
before she got pregnant with me.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.631
A proper married woman
shouldn't have any other focus...

31:12.804 --> 31:17.264
...besides the desires
of her newborn and loving husband.

31:18.943 --> 31:25.439
So her piano-playing went from
having her on the brink of stardom...

31:26.451 --> 31:29.443
...to becoming a pastime
in our living room.

31:33.424 --> 31:38.327
I have wonderful memories
sitting on her lap while she played.

31:40.331 --> 31:44.734
Those are the only moments
I remember feeling close to her.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.403
As the years went on...

31:49.841 --> 31:53.971
...I heard less and less
of the piano...

31:54.145 --> 31:58.775
...and more and more
of her drunken tirades.

32:03.121 --> 32:08.787
For my 13th birthday,
my father gave me piano lessons...

32:08.960 --> 32:12.953
...because I was determined
to learn to play like my mother.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.890
The day I came home
from my first piano lessons...

32:18.369 --> 32:20.394
...my mother was drunk.

32:21.706 --> 32:24.334
As soon as I walked in the door...

32:25.510 --> 32:29.913
...she slapped me to the floor.

32:32.951 --> 32:39.083
I went to the bathroom,
shut the door and picked up a razor.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.025
That was my first cut.

32:45.596 --> 32:49.225
But the last one
was seven years ago.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.863
You don't need to hide from me.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.870
- I better go.
- No, stay.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.669
- No.
- Stay, stay.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.004
Please.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.338
I can't.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.291
- What do most Americans wanna be?
- Would you try--?

33:50.461 --> 33:52.395
Spit it out. What do they wanna be?

33:52.563 --> 33:54.861
- They wanna be rich.
- Rich. Great.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.628
Yeah. What else?

33:56.801 --> 33:58.632
And young, you know--

33:58.803 --> 34:00.737
Young. Of course.

34:00.905 --> 34:03.169
- Strong.
- Strong. Great, yep.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.310
They wanna be respected.
I mean, I wanna be respected.

34:06.477 --> 34:09.071
And successful.
They wanna be successful.

34:09.246 --> 34:10.373
- Jules.
- Yes?

34:10.547 --> 34:11.572
Can I have a word?

34:11.748 --> 34:14.411
Larry, I am getting you those numbers.
As soon as Julian--

34:14.585 --> 34:16.246
Reviews them.
Keep going, here, Greg.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.614
- Well, I--
- Do it.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.552
It's great.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.581
Yes?

34:21.759 --> 34:24.455
Were you in a graveyard
watching a movie recently?

34:24.629 --> 34:25.652
- Yes.
- Yes.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.627
Did you hit someone
in the graveyard?

34:29.867 --> 34:31.630
- I did.
- Yeah.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.495
Can you make it go away?

34:35.440 --> 34:39.103
I found out that Joseph Marcell,
you know, the guy that you hit?

34:39.377 --> 34:41.436
He's trying to become
an American citizen.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.944
- Fantastic.
- So I called him and warned him...

34:44.114 --> 34:47.277
...that pressing charges
could complicate his application.

34:49.053 --> 34:51.418
Seventy-five hundred dollars
will make it go away.

34:51.589 --> 34:54.023
- Send him a check.
- Yeah, I will.

34:54.891 --> 34:59.795
Six years of school,
15 years of corporate and criminal.

35:00.364 --> 35:01.797
We're nearly there, Julian.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.434
You're gonna be rich. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.004
- You're an idiot.
- This is fun.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.041
Sis.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.778
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.046
You need some help?

35:25.890 --> 35:27.448
What's going on?

35:27.625 --> 35:29.354
Nothing.

35:29.527 --> 35:32.496
- Rita, what happened?
- Nothing.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.961
I'm just gonna stay with Mom
for a couple days.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.157
Where is he?

35:37.168 --> 35:39.568
Julian, I just need a little space.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.204
That's it.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.862
How are you? Are you good?

35:44.075 --> 35:45.667
Fine.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.837
You look good.

35:51.749 --> 35:53.740
What are you doing
with all that paint?

35:53.918 --> 35:56.216
What do you think I'm doing
with that paint?

35:56.387 --> 36:00.016
Mom. She asked me
to paint the goddamn room.

37:36.921 --> 37:40.288
- Hello?
- <i>Can you come see me?</i>

37:43.461 --> 37:46.658
- I'm working.
- <i>You work too much.</i>

37:46.831 --> 37:48.628
<i>Meet me.</i>

37:49.533 --> 37:51.535
Well, where are you?

38:02.647 --> 38:04.478
Park your car.

38:04.649 --> 38:05.775
What are you doing?

38:06.350 --> 38:08.545
You got to take pictures of me.

38:08.719 --> 38:12.211
So now it's my turn.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.823
Park.

38:13.991 --> 38:17.119
How about you get in my car
and I take us wherever you wanna go?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.821
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
That doesn't work.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.056
But, Michael, I can't--

38:22.233 --> 38:24.030
Mr. Wright, shut up.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.896
And get in the car.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.140
Welcome, Mr. Wright.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.917
Thank you. Thanks.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.036
- Michael.
- What?

39:01.205 --> 39:03.469
Put the camera away.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.101
Put the camera away.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.339
Okay.

39:12.717 --> 39:14.480
You look beautiful.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.244
So do you.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.053
I think you mean "handsome."

39:19.223 --> 39:20.781
No.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.927
Beautiful would be the way
to describe it.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.495
So, what's this about?

39:26.931 --> 39:28.831
It's about you.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.728
But you have to trust me.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.890
No, that's tight enough.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.391
It won't hurt.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.893
I promise it. It will be fun.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.469
May I please have your hands?

40:05.636 --> 40:07.160
No. No.

40:07.338 --> 40:08.930
- Okay, okay.
- Hands are off-limits.

40:09.106 --> 40:11.973
Just--
Can I just stay like this?

40:12.476 --> 40:13.636
And promise not to touch.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.479
You can't touch.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.205
Really?

40:18.382 --> 40:19.940
You can't touch.

40:20.117 --> 40:22.813
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.788
- Michael?
- Thalia.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.927
What the fuck?

41:37.361 --> 41:39.420
Oh, shit.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.162
Turn the fu--

41:41.332 --> 41:44.199
- Michael, turn the fucking camera off.
- It's Thalia.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.859
I can see who it is, thank you.
Turn the camera off.

41:47.037 --> 41:51.736
- Okay. It's okay.
- Stop the fucking car, okay?

41:51.909 --> 41:55.072
- You had your joke. That's enough.
- Wait, just for fun.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.838
Yeah, funny.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.083
- Thank you very much.
- Julian, come on.

42:01.118 --> 42:02.881
Oh, my gosh.

42:03.053 --> 42:05.681
Julian. Julian.

42:10.294 --> 42:12.592
Hey, wait a minute.

42:13.797 --> 42:15.765
Wait a minute.

42:18.102 --> 42:19.729
I never, l--

42:19.904 --> 42:22.099
I didn't know
you could be so offended.

42:22.273 --> 42:23.570
Where are you going?

42:23.774 --> 42:24.934
I don't fucking know.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.174
Julian, come on.

42:27.344 --> 42:28.811
Is--

42:30.848 --> 42:33.248
I thought it would be fun.

42:33.417 --> 42:34.748
Michael, go home.

42:35.185 --> 42:37.745
Okay, but at least
let me take you back to your car.

42:38.756 --> 42:43.056
I'm not gonna leave you here,
in the middle of nowhere, okay?

42:43.894 --> 42:46.158
Okay, let's go.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.103
- <i>Michael, turn the fucking camera off.</i>
- <i>It's Thalia.</i>

42:56.273 --> 42:58.764
<i>I can see who it is, thank you.</i>
<i>Turn the camera off.</i>

42:58.943 --> 43:03.277
- <i>Okay. It's okay.</i>
- <i>Stop the fucking car, okay?</i>

43:03.447 --> 43:05.779
<i>You had your joke. That's enough.</i>

43:05.950 --> 43:07.781
- <i>Okay, stop the car.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

43:09.119 --> 43:10.950
<i>What's wrong?</i>

43:12.623 --> 43:13.817
Enough, okay?

43:13.991 --> 43:16.323
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>Yeah, funny.</i>

43:16.493 --> 43:18.154
Enough.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.588
Okay?

43:21.765 --> 43:25.428
You wanna play games? Is that it?

43:27.304 --> 43:31.764
You think you wanna play games,
huh?

44:28.565 --> 44:30.499
Does that feel good?

45:06.136 --> 45:07.694
Fuck.

45:48.779 --> 45:50.940
Who is she?

45:53.917 --> 45:56.408
Who? Who is who?

45:58.789 --> 46:00.484
The one you love.

46:00.657 --> 46:03.057
There's no one that I love.

46:05.162 --> 46:07.653
There is always someone.

46:08.532 --> 46:11.262
Did she have the combination?

46:13.504 --> 46:16.029
No, she didn't.

46:16.874 --> 46:18.774
That's too bad.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.706
Is that what you're after?

46:25.649 --> 46:28.140
How can this really matter
without it?

47:19.102 --> 47:21.502
So did you and Larry
have a successful morning...

47:21.672 --> 47:24.664
...pondering the contractual points
of your new future?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.070
We did.

47:26.243 --> 47:28.177
Michael Reed left that for you.

47:30.447 --> 47:32.438
Nice box.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.083
How's Michael Reed's box?

47:34.251 --> 47:35.616
Who is she?

47:36.687 --> 47:37.949
Hi.

47:38.121 --> 47:40.487
- Yeah.
- You...

47:41.592 --> 47:43.719
You better call
Adrienne's florist for me.

47:43.894 --> 47:45.418
Oh, yeah, I'd better. Okay.

47:46.163 --> 47:48.028
Wow, look at you.

47:48.198 --> 47:51.793
- What?
- I've just never seen you like this.

47:52.302 --> 47:53.997
- What?
- Nice.

47:54.171 --> 47:56.162
All right,
the Praylis' dinner's tonight.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.968
- Are you taking Larry?
- No, I'm gonna take a friend.

47:59.142 --> 48:01.736
- Oh, a friend.
- Yes, get the florist on the line.

48:01.912 --> 48:04.437
If the friend has a name,
I need to know to RSVP.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.344
- Winters will be there, okay?
- Great.

48:06.516 --> 48:08.381
- Thank you.
- Just a heads up.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.951
You're welcome, my darling.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.517
"Your camera is old."

49:10.414 --> 49:11.847
Hi.

49:13.350 --> 49:14.374
May I help you?

49:14.551 --> 49:17.384
Yeah, I'm looking for Michael Reed.
Does she work here?

49:18.055 --> 49:19.545
Sometimes.

49:20.757 --> 49:21.849
Is she here today?

49:22.025 --> 49:23.788
No. Probably tomorrow.

49:24.194 --> 49:26.355
She's at the L.A. City Museum
for a showing.

49:26.530 --> 49:29.499
Can I give her a message?

49:29.666 --> 49:30.997
Nope.

49:31.168 --> 49:33.636
I'm going to have to leave something
for her.

49:34.004 --> 49:36.234
Will you help me set it up?

49:54.124 --> 49:56.558
Okay. Thank you for coming.

50:19.149 --> 50:20.514
Everything's beautiful.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.712
- Thank you.
- They're waiting. Come on.

50:27.624 --> 50:30.115
Boyd, we really need to go.

50:32.629 --> 50:34.062
Gotta go.

50:49.279 --> 50:51.406
- Julian.
- Hi.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.481
Oh, my goodness.

50:53.650 --> 50:56.949
What are you doing here?
How do you know?

50:57.587 --> 50:59.145
I went by the gallery.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.627
That's great.

51:07.964 --> 51:09.727
Who was that? Who was that?

51:10.667 --> 51:11.895
What?

51:13.170 --> 51:14.569
That guy you just kissed.

51:15.806 --> 51:18.138
- Excuse me?
- Michael, who is he?

51:21.244 --> 51:22.575
Okay.

51:22.746 --> 51:25.146
- Okay, we need to talk, but--
- Let's talk.

51:25.315 --> 51:26.976
- This is not the place, so...
- Sure.

51:27.150 --> 51:28.447
I wanna talk here.

51:28.618 --> 51:30.950
- I can't. I can't.
- Right now.

51:31.154 --> 51:32.917
Michael, who was he?

51:35.926 --> 51:37.553
- Tell me who he is.
- Julian, please.

51:37.727 --> 51:39.888
- Well, just tell me who he is.
- Come on.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.400
- I don't know why you're here.
- Michael, who is he?

51:46.570 --> 51:49.937
- I can't talk to you now, okay?
- Where are we going?

51:50.107 --> 51:51.597
- I'm working.
- Tell me who he is.

51:51.775 --> 51:52.799
Let's talk tomorrow.

51:52.976 --> 51:54.375
- Just tell me.
- Tomorrow.

51:54.544 --> 51:55.943
Just tell me now, who is he?

51:56.113 --> 51:57.410
- No.
- Just tell me who he is.

51:57.581 --> 51:59.048
- I'm working.
- Tell me who he is.

51:59.216 --> 52:01.912
- I need you to trust me.
- I trust you. Tell me who he is.

52:02.085 --> 52:03.746
My husband.

52:05.355 --> 52:06.879
I'm married.

52:08.425 --> 52:11.087
I'm-- Oh, Julian, I'm sorry.

52:11.261 --> 52:13.388
I just needed time
to find a way to tell you.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.398
But it's not what you think, okay?
It's--

52:19.569 --> 52:22.402
He knows everything.
He knows about you.

52:22.572 --> 52:24.802
He knows about us.

52:24.975 --> 52:28.342
- He knows what you mean to me.
- What the fuck does that mean?

52:28.879 --> 52:30.642
What does that mean?

52:30.814 --> 52:33.146
- Julian, please.
- What I mean to you.

52:33.316 --> 52:35.648
- Don't do this.
- Oh, shit, Michael.

52:35.819 --> 52:38.310
I know this is not easy.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.718
- Stay the fuck away from me, okay?
- But--

52:40.891 --> 52:42.017
Julian.

52:43.593 --> 52:46.187
Julian. Julian, please.

52:47.597 --> 52:49.565
Julian, I'm sorry, just...

52:49.733 --> 52:52.065
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Let's talk now, okay?

52:52.235 --> 52:54.135
Don't go like that.

53:18.295 --> 53:19.728
Yes, Mom.

53:19.896 --> 53:21.727
<i>I need you to get over here now.</i>

53:21.898 --> 53:24.799
<i>Tony might come</i>
<i>and the kids are scared shitless.</i>

53:25.202 --> 53:26.931
- Ma, hang up--
- <i>Don't know what to do.</i>

53:27.103 --> 53:30.106
Hang up, Ma. I'm calling the police.
I'm on the way, okay?

53:34.611 --> 53:36.943
- Go get the kids!
- Tony!

53:38.048 --> 53:39.743
- Don't get out.
- No!

53:39.983 --> 53:42.417
You get in the truck
and nobody gets hurt, all right?

53:42.586 --> 53:45.919
This is my goddamn family.
You stay away, all right?

53:48.625 --> 53:49.922
Asshole.

53:50.327 --> 53:51.726
Go, go, go.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.886
Julian, stop it. You're gonna kill him.

53:54.431 --> 53:55.898
Fucking hero again, huh?

53:57.734 --> 53:59.065
Julian.

54:00.937 --> 54:02.336
Don't move. Stay right there.

54:02.505 --> 54:04.302
Julian, you're gonna kill him.
Stop it.

54:04.474 --> 54:06.840
Kill him! Kill him!

54:07.010 --> 54:09.740
- Julian! Julian!
- Kill him!

54:09.913 --> 54:12.211
- Get back inside.
- No, Rita.

54:13.650 --> 54:14.742
Kill him!

54:16.253 --> 54:17.652
Kill him!

54:18.121 --> 54:20.419
- Kill him!
- I fucking told you.

54:30.233 --> 54:33.293
Mr. Wright,
it's time for your phone call.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.932
I'm not ready.

54:36.606 --> 54:39.769
- Excuse me?
- I said, I'm not ready.

54:41.478 --> 54:43.378
Suit yourself.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.972
Meet me in the office in 30 minutes.

56:05.495 --> 56:08.191
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

56:11.935 --> 56:13.596
Come here.

56:16.506 --> 56:17.996
Come on.

56:25.882 --> 56:27.577
Sit down.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.825
You know when I said
I'd buy you a house?

56:48.638 --> 56:50.902
Then I said
I'd buy you a Barbie house.

56:51.074 --> 56:54.566
- Do you remember?
- We were kids, Julian.

56:55.011 --> 56:56.171
I know, but it's time.

56:56.613 --> 56:58.911
It's time I bought you a house.

56:59.682 --> 57:03.243
- Really?
- I'm serious. Okay?

57:05.922 --> 57:07.389
Yes?

57:08.558 --> 57:10.116
Come on.

57:15.799 --> 57:17.664
You haven't been charged
with anything...

57:17.834 --> 57:19.699
...because Tony's still in a coma.

57:22.439 --> 57:26.034
No investigation can take place
until he wakes up.

57:26.209 --> 57:31.203
So is there a chance
he's gonna spend any jail time?

57:32.482 --> 57:35.610
Look, with Tony's priors and
his history of violence towards Rita--

57:35.785 --> 57:38.720
I mean, he very well could
have charges brought up against him.

57:38.888 --> 57:41.118
So it's possible
this could all go away.

57:41.724 --> 57:43.385
Possibly, yeah. Yeah.

57:43.560 --> 57:45.221
No victim, no case.

57:45.395 --> 57:47.659
But as of now, we're in limbo.

57:49.699 --> 57:50.723
And Praylis?

57:50.900 --> 57:56.065
We told him last night at the party
that you had a family emergency.

57:57.440 --> 58:00.967
But obviously they're gonna find out.
They're gonna find out.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.408
We should tell them
before somebody else does.

58:03.580 --> 58:05.343
I mean, tell them the truth,
you know.

58:05.515 --> 58:08.951
Tell them you were defending
your family and you were, right?

58:14.057 --> 58:17.686
There is one part of this that is
gonna be tricky and that's the brick.

58:18.361 --> 58:22.923
My understanding is that Tony
didn't even have a weapon...

58:23.099 --> 58:24.760
...so the question is gonna be...

58:24.934 --> 58:27.232
...did you really need to use
that much force?

58:29.906 --> 58:33.933
I'm confident that if he lives,
you'll avoid jail time.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.509
But if he dies...

58:37.046 --> 58:39.207
...it's a completely different story.

58:40.316 --> 58:41.943
Hey.

58:43.353 --> 58:47.187
I need to know
that you're gonna pull it together.

58:47.357 --> 58:50.349
And make this deal happen
for chrissake.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.757
You don't ever bring
your personal affairs...

58:52.929 --> 58:54.794
...into your business life, Julian.

58:54.964 --> 58:56.556
Ellison.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.059
- Okay, it won't happen again.
- Good.

58:59.235 --> 59:00.532
Get focused.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.641
Morning.

59:12.248 --> 59:14.512
- Morning, Cheryl.
- Hey.

59:14.684 --> 59:16.242
You okay?

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.629
One second.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.503
Hey, Rita's on Line 1.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.271
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, I found a house.</i>

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.413
- Oh, what, already?
- <i>Yes. It's beautiful.</i>

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.604
- You did?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.045
- Got a picture?
- <i>No, I need you to come see it.</i>

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.241
No, e-mail it.

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.784
<i>Julian, I can't e-mail.</i>
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.451
Rita, hold on.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.486
Yes, Julian?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.629
Cheryl, have Security
remove her immediately.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.491
She's the woman who--

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:39.635
- Cheryl, just do it.
- Yep, yep.

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:44.739
Yeah, I need two guys immediately,
front desk.

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.875
Yeah. Bye.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.012
Rita, I'm sorry. You were--

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.481
We were-- Where were we?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:57.711
- <i>The house?</i>
- Yes?

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:00.788
- <i>Yes, Julian, it's expensive.</i>
- No, don't worry about the money.

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.857
Everything's negotiable.
Leave that to me.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.687
<i>I need you to see it. You have to--</i>

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:07.329
- No, the main thing is that you love it.
- <i>Well, I do--</i>

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.863
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta get back to work.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.866
- I love you, okay?
- <i>I love you. All right.</i>

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:59.138
You need to come up for air.
You've been stuck in here all day.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.351
Have you eaten?

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.749
Okay, I'm gonna get you
some food...

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:10.086
...and if I have to spoon-feed you,
I will.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:25.132
- Anything you wanna talk about?
- Cheryl, please, I need to finish this.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.407
Don't do that.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:36.215
As much as you've been there
for me...

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.649
...it's not fair for you
to treat me like that...

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.482
...because I want to help you.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.691
Okay?

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.151
Don't worry about locking up.
I'll do it.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.763
Cheryl?

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.030
I'm sorry.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.710
Thank you for the flowers.

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.125
What happened to you?

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:22.258
Julian, I know what you think,
but it's not what it seems.

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:25.298
My husband and I
have an understanding.

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.403
I understand if that's something
you can't handle.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.972
But I am not a liar.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.904
And I am not an adulterer, okay?

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.771
Fantastic.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.575
You should meet him.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:41.443
You are un-fucking believable,
you know that?

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.381
We don't have
conventional agreements.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.487
Oh, so that makes it right?

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.517
Right? Right?

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:53.290
What is right? What is right, Julian?

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:56.993
People live right every day
and they still aren't happy.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.994
We get to decide what is right for us.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.693
Lf...

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:06.865
If you make my life better
and I make your life better...

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:09.301
...what is wrong about that?

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:13.271
What else are relationships
supposed to be?

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:18.315
If you don't like this, fine.

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:21.790
But don't base it
in all those arbitrary standards...

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:27.225
...we are forced to believe
are contracts of some kind.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.561
Julian, look at me.

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:38.368
I can love you as hard as you want.

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:43.712
It just won't be in the form
people say it should be.

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:54.522
You deserve to have me.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.387
And anything else you want.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.192
I need you.

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.706
No, I'll stay here.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.177
Yeah.

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.547
When are you coming home?

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.780
No, I haven't forgotten.

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.988
I love you too.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.393
I'll see you Sunday, okay?

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.640
You want to?

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.505
No.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.084
Let's get a Christmas tree today.

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:09.247
I hate Christmas.

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:15.387
I promise,
this Christmas will be different.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.510
Okay.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.448
Enough.

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.718
Let's get dressed.

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.092
Oh, my God.

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:03.893
Keep them closed.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.432
Not yet.

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:15.167
Almost...

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:18.802
And now.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.352
When did you do this?

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.490
A king never asks how or why.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.455
He just sits and enjoys.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:33.492
So please.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:42.895
It's amazing.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.036
There you go.

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.876
What?

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.251
Open.

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:03.991
Your eyes are so beautiful.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.788
They draw me in.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.256
But they won't let me see you.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.467
And I want to see all of you.

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.870
When is your birthday?

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:29.183
September 19.

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.648
Virgo.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.725
Okay.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.260
Do you like what you do, Julian?

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.592
Does it make you happy?

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.530
My job? It's work.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.432
It pays the bills. I'm good at it.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.072
I do what's required.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:55.642
Who determines what's required?

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.711
What do you love?

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.213
What is your passion?

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.251
I love being with you.

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:10.491
What's your passion?

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:17.826
Having you say
you love being with me.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.704
Do you like kids, Michael?

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.066
Yeah, I do very much.

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.404
Do you wanna have children?

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.243
I probably won't have any.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:35.576
Why not?

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:40.154
I think I am a better mom to adults.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.293
My nephews are having
a birthday party...

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.364
...at my mother's tomorrow.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.193
Would you like to come?

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.430
- Yeah.
- You do?

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:58.971
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.299
Kiss me.

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.895
Interesting how it's our job...

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:33.166
...to make people believe in things
that aren't necessarily true.

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:36.607
It's why I stopped doing criminal law
and started corporate law.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:40.408
I didn't wanna protect the guilty
and convict the innocent anymore.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.413
Okay, Larry. What are you saying?

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:46.520
I got a phone call from a Steven Carter
from Innovative Identity Group...

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:49.088
...asking me about you
and a Michael Reed.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.692
- It's none of your business.
- Julian? Yes, Larry?

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.919
Stop seeing her.
Why? Because she's married.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.087
I don't know,
Mr. Praylis doesn't like that?

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.028
Larry, it's none of your business.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.667
Are you trying to sabotage this?

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.360
Because you are doing
a fucking wonderful job.

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.369
Great job.

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:08.267
Are you forgetting who put you here in
your big house with your lovely wife?

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.843
- You wanna jog memories?
- Yeah.

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.206
Remember who you called...

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.042
...when you found your wife
and her boyfriend in your bed?

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.774
- You called me, me.
- You--

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.179
Do you remember that?

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:21.186
You haven't gotten over that.
Now you wanna drag us into this shit?

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.721
- Dude, look--
- You and this whole company...

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:31.161
...have been riding on my back
for five years.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.960
You got a short fucking memory.

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:36.470
- Julian.
- Don't fucking tell me what to do.

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:40.005
I hate to break it to you, Julian,
but this isn't a one-man fucking show.

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.506
Okay? This isn't your show.

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.406
You have a team of people
out there...

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:46.605
...that need you to think
outside your fucking dick.

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:49.444
- You'd better go.
- No, I'm not gonna go.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.308
Tomorrow morning at 10:00...

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.650
...we have the fucking biggest meeting
of our lives.

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.992
I'm gonna pick you up.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:02.558
And you better be fucking focused.

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:05.824
Larry...

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.174
Hey, Uncle Jay.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.438
Hey, we heard there's a birthday party
on here today.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.911
- Is that right?
- Yes.

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.380
- Is it? Well, who's birthday is it?
- Ours.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.041
Oh, it's your birthday.

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.914
- Is it really?
- Yes.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.487
Are those gifts for us?

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.920
Are those gifts for you?
I don't see anybody else.

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:32.117
- Is there some? No?
- Can we open them?

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.888
Right after you've said hello
to my friend Michael.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.963
Michael, this is Daniel.

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.599
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.359
- And Derrick.
- Nice to meet you.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.265
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.904
Yeah?

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.130
What?

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.899
Are you Uncle Jay's girlfriend?

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.678
What?

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.904
I guess you could say that.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.673
But enough about me.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.976
Open your gifts.

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.642
There you go.

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:59.446
All right, give me a kiss, come on.

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.054
Happy birthday.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.691
I like your new girlfriend, Uncle Jay.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.587
They're a handful.

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.890
Rita, this is my friend Michael.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.591
Michael, this is my sister, Rita.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.168
- Hi.
- Very pleased to meet you.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.396
Nice to meet you.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.871
I will help you set it up.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.010
I can't believe they're 10.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.139
What'd you get them?

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.644
We got them a video game.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.042
- Julian.
- What?

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.683
- I don't like video games.
- Come on.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.113
Look at them.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.945
This is awesome.
Look at that game.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.783
Look at that.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.592
You good?

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.356
I am, yeah.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.931
He spoke to me today.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.700
- And?
- And...

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.931
I think everything's gonna be okay.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.700
- I don't think he'll press charges.
- Good, good.

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.570
It's looking good.

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:59.475
And he's gonna be in the hospital
for a while.

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:03.584
Doctor said he's gonna need some
taking care of when he comes home.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.980
So...

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:07.144
Sorry, he's what?

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.460
Julian, don't look at me like that,
please. I just--

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.153
So what?

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.725
- I just--
- It's up to the father...

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.834
...to work things out, not us.
- There's nothing to work out.

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:23.164
- That's not your decision.
- And it's yours?

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:26.899
Okay. Listen, I will buy you
that house tomorrow.

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:28.804
- Julian--
- Tomorrow.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.604
She took an oath, Julian.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.179
Tony is her husband,
she has responsibility to him.

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:34.975
Mom, can you please just?

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.517
And what about his responsibility
to her? To those kids?

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.678
Look at those boys. Look at them.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.016
This is not fair on them.

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.919
Children are resilient.

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:46.253
They're closer to God
than any of us.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:49.295
I wouldn't consider simply surviving
as optimum parenting.

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.455
- Julian, please.
- No. No.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.567
I see. I'm the reason
that Lynn left you.

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:56.568
I'm the reason that your life
has failed like it has.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:18:00.265
Who is responsible for the good things
that have happened to you, Julian?

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.535
I am, okay?

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:04.469
I am.

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:07.442
I'm going to pray for you.

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.277
I'm going to pray to God...

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.783
...that he doesn't knock you off
your high horse.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.183
Yeah, you do that, okay?
You do that.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.449
But this, this is not happening.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:19.116
- This is not happening, okay?
- But, Julian, just...

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:21.285
This is not happening.

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.357
Rita?

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.094
Rita, did I say something wrong?

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.400
No, Ma, you didn't.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.788
Can we talk?

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:51.017
I'm a big girl.

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.821
- I'm not gonna break.
- Look, it's complicated, okay?

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.926
What?

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.794
Talk to me.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.272
Hey, Mom.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.183
<i>Oh, my God. Mom.</i>

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.289
There are blessings in pain, Julian.

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:27.019
You just need the strength
to open those locked doors.

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:30.631
See what it is, know it and move on.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.133
Otherwise...

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:38.364
...it will steal
what makes us beautiful...

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.866
...and feed our monster.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.750
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know.

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.414
<i>Hello?</i>

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.157
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I need to see you.

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.655
Julian?

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:11.355
Yeah, I need to see you right now,
Michael.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.194
Are you okay?

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.499
- Yeah, I just--
- Julian.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.867
Yeah, Michael,
you don't understand.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.839
I need to see you right, right now.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.444
But I can't right now.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.410
I'm having dinner.

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:28.105
Yeah?

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:30.478
Yeah, with him?

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.779
Yes, Boyd.

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:35.155
Well, tell him you gotta go.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.821
It's important, Michael.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.722
<i>I can't.</i>

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.988
This is a planned evening.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:45.064
If you want tomorrow, I can see you,
but not today.

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.692
<i>Jul--</i>

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:55.800
Help me.

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:52.817
<i>This is Julian Wright.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.137
Are you okay?

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:22.872
Julian, have you seen my shoes?

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.753
You should have called.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.083
I did.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:30.390
But you never answer.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.366
Hi, we've met before.

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.469
Give me a call when you're finished,
okay?

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.544
- I will.
- Okay.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:54.542
- Nice to see you again...
- Michael.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.876
Michael.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.925
We should talk.

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.196
What's to talk about?

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:16.997
Now, I thought we were being
free and open.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.662
Listen to me.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.104
I will not be kept.

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.573
By anybody.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:24.775
Well, not by me you won't.

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:28.510
Something keeps you.

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.792
- Open it.
- No!

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.797
Hey, what the fuck, Michael?

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:49.596
What the fuck is this, Michael?
What are you doing?

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:50.795
I know, I know.

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:54.908
What bullshit and what lies did you
tell your husband just to be here?

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.208
This is so fucking stupid.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:01.644
I mean, thinking that anything with you
could possibly work out.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:06.084
I'm sick of your fucking bullshit too,
Michael, your stupid little games.

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:09.155
Making me think you know
more than I do when the fact is...

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:11.724
...you're more fucked up
than I'll ever be.

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:17.157
You are so arrogant.

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:18.458
And small.

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:21.797
But you'll never make me
small enough...

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:25.462
...to fit inside
your little automated world...

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.609
...with your little
programmed beliefs.

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:31.802
Well, when did being decent
become so diminishing?

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.107
You tell me
one successful relationship...

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:40.619
...you have ever had with anybody
to be able to justify what is decent.

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:45.589
My husband and I have the decency
to allow each other the lives we need.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.728
No, but did you ever stop
for one second...

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.954
...and think what I might need?

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.122
- I thought you were a big boy.
- Oh, I am.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.269
- I thought you could be mature.
- Oh, you want me to be mature?

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.165
How about you give us
a separate hole?

01:27:57.338 --> 01:27:59.670
How about I fuck your ass
and he fucks your pussy?

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:03.174
Maybe you'll even learn
to like us both at the same time.

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:16.984
Michael, are you okay?

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.967
Michael.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.741
Oh, shit.

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:43.484
Fuck, Michael.

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.721
Oh, Jesus Christ, Michael.

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:51.290
Oh, fuck. Leave it there.
Leave it there, okay?

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.450
Oh, shit.

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.152
Michael.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.693
Shit. Baby, look.

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:02.233
Come in. Hey, come on.

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:04.303
It's okay.
Somebody's gonna help you soon.

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:08.340
- Jesus Christ, what's going on?
- Larry, call 911. Call 911.

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.771
Yeah...

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:43.771
<i>Dr. Wilcox,</i>
<i>please pick up Extension 1216.</i>

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.958
Cheryl, I can't talk.

<i>Dr. Johnson to 231.</i>

<i>Available physician's assistant</i>
<i>to ER staff.</i>

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:55.011
You will never see Michael again.

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.651
And if you so much as try...

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.456
...I will kill you.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.277
<i>Heather Pent</i>

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:34.353
<i>Heather Pent</i>

I...

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:52.685
I wanna apologize. I wanna
look in her eyes and I want to just...

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.452
Please.

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.689
Hey.

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.466
I'm sorry, Michael.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:53.679
Three, one, four, one, six.

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:52.506
<i>Michael...</i>

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.877
<i>...you're the only person on earth...</i>

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:57.574
<i>...I've ever given the combination</i>

<i>It's a key to my room of secrets.</i>

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.555
<i>And I give it to you.</i>

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.722
<i>All of it.</i>

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.631
<i>My shame.</i>

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:15.128
<i>My loss.</i>

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.528
<i>And lies.</i>

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:23.103
<i>And it all starts with my mother.</i>

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.504
Say something.

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:00.779
Please.

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.494
I came home from school, Mom.

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.257
And I found you in...

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:19.925
<i>Mom.</i>

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:23.400
Hey, Mom?

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.509
Mommy?

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.237
Mom.

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:35.439
Mom. Oh, my God, Mom.

01:37:35.616 --> 01:37:37.641
Mom, get up.

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:39.410
Mommy, wake up.

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.819
<i>Mom, get up.</i>

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.990
Our father...

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:54.563
What did I do
that made you wanna kill yourself?

01:37:58.372 --> 01:37:59.896
Look at me.

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:01.473
Ma, just look at me.

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:06.537
- Who art in heaven.
- Okay.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.942
Hallowed be thy name.

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.374
And then what does it say?

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.575
Thy kingdom come.

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:14.778
"Ten-year-old boy
saves mother from gas leak.

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:18.550
- Julian Wright, a hero.
- Thy will be done.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.559
- Pulled his mother...
- Amen.

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:23.729
...from a..."

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:28.893
Before the police came, you told me
to yank the cord and to lie, so I did.

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:30.434
I did, Ma, I lied.

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:35.940
I lied to the police, to all my friends.

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:37.967
And why did I do it, Ma?

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:40.204
Because you asked me to.

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:43.748
I did it because you asked me to,
and I didn't want it to happen again.

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:46.113
- You shouldn't blame me.
- I shouldn't blame you?

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.379
Who should I blame? God?

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:48.578
Is God gonna save us?

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:49.916
God, what? God is love.

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.614
- God's good.
- God's gonna save us.

01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:53.919
What fucking God
is gonna save us from that?

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:56.494
- Oh, my God.
- What God?

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.495
- Yeah, hit me, hit me.
- Stop, stop.

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:01.635
God don't love you and I.

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:06.433
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to raise you two?

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.040
No, I don't.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:10.438
And then you go off
and you get this degree.

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:13.136
- You think you're better than me.
- It's not about that.

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:16.112
- But you know what? You're nothing.
- It's not about that.

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.511
You're nothing.

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.748
I know I'm not.

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:22.818
Why? Why did you pull me out?

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.617
Why did you pull me out?

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.760
Why did you pull me
out of the oven?

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:30.886
- Why didn't you leave me there?
- Because I need you, Ma. I need you.

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.360
Come on.

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:42.205
Come on, hold me, please, Ma.
Just hold me.

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:43.968
Please.

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.310
Please.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:49.677
Hold me, Ma, hold me.

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:53.449
Oh, God.

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:08.231
<i>I have never believed</i>
<i>I deserved to be loved.</i>

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:17.371
<i>But now I see that everything</i>
<i>I've ever wanted...</i>

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:21.111
<i>...has always been</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:26.444
<i>I've been the only thing</i>
<i>standing in my way.</i>

01:40:28.889 --> 01:40:30.686
<i>But no more.</i>

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:34.458
<i>No more.</i>

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:39.023
<i>I wish you all the best, Michael.</i>

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:41.293
<i>Julian.</i>

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.076
Did you guys do
what I asked you to do?

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.876
You did?
