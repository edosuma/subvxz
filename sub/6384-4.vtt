00:02.416 --> 00:03.339
Sonja.

00:04.227 --> 00:05.216
Awkward.

00:10.508 --> 00:12.149
Nice to see you again.

00:13.134 --> 00:14.975
I'm pregnant.
You didn't notice my bump?

00:15.136 --> 00:17.936
- Julian's a writer, too.
- Really? My condolences.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.731
I like to think of myself
as more of a creative midwife.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.540
You're officially back together?

00:22.660 --> 00:24.818
- Until we fuck it up.
- Could be any second now.

00:27.357 --> 00:29.330
I got this, book deal.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.951
They want to write about
why everything I touch turns to gold.

00:33.112 --> 00:34.078
You write it.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.104
- Beatrice Trixie.
- Hank Moody.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.374
One girl, two cocks:
Ultimate showdown!

00:39.433 --> 00:43.253
I've had both of them, but they forget 
that they both paid for the sex.

00:43.415 --> 00:46.549
Have we met?
You always have some fucking excuse!

00:46.709 --> 00:49.176
Dude, this fucking perv
just tried to mouth-rape me.

00:49.338 --> 00:51.637
- I accidentally went down on her.
- I fucking hate you!

00:52.757 --> 00:54.723
If you sit here,
people will think you're weird.

00:54.885 --> 00:57.309
And here I was, planning to run
for prom queen.

01:00.139 --> 01:01.772
Back to work, assholes!

01:01.994 --> 01:03.732
We're making rock history here!

Woman! What are you doing?
I'm rocking "medium" now.

01:26.982 --> 01:29.091
86th percentile.
Don't shut the "freebird" down.

01:29.372 --> 01:32.564
- What happened to the clearing up?
- I kind of focused on the patio.

01:32.684 --> 01:35.313
And then I was summoned
by the Gods of rock.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.726
- One must take heed of that shit.
- Right.

01:38.308 --> 01:42.213
We're having a dinner party.
So why would you focus on the patio?

01:42.333 --> 01:44.723
God! When you say it out loud
like that, it sounds awful.

01:44.843 --> 01:48.311
- Is it too late to call off?
- Stop it. It's gonna be fun, right?

01:48.431 --> 01:49.403
Really?

01:49.565 --> 01:52.823
'Cause I think it's gonna be like
having a Q-Tip jammed up my urethra.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.617
For three hours.
Without lube.

01:55.870 --> 01:58.162
Which could be fun
if you do it... to me.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.622
- Wanna?
- Come on. Let's get going.

02:01.057 --> 02:03.226
But I think you should
check out the patio.

02:03.346 --> 02:05.836
I think you'll be pleased.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.924
Judas Priest, Hank.

02:11.492 --> 02:12.926
What are you up to?

02:14.621 --> 02:17.306
I was hoping you'd finally make
an honest woman of me.

02:18.106 --> 02:19.332
What is that?

02:19.555 --> 02:21.602
Is it not jaw-droppingly beautiful?

02:21.868 --> 02:24.618
Does it not to make
the love juices to flow?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.068
I thought you gave that
to a homeless woman.

02:30.244 --> 02:32.946
Who gives diamonds to the homeless?
Not I, Rabbi.

02:34.818 --> 02:37.374
- I don't know what to say...
- Okay, well then,

02:37.494 --> 02:39.536
let me relieve you
of your root vegetables...

02:40.410 --> 02:41.706
and allow me.

02:46.619 --> 02:47.969
I love you, Karen.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.507
And I wanna spend the rest of my life
annoying the shit out of you.

02:52.512 --> 02:55.562
And I want the rest of my life
to start right now.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.203
I'm sick and tired
of fighting about the past.

03:02.323 --> 03:04.873
We're not going anywhere.
I get that now.

03:05.574 --> 03:06.924
This is our home.

03:08.385 --> 03:11.363
Because home is wherever you
and Becca are.

03:13.949 --> 03:14.999
I love L.A.

03:15.449 --> 03:16.471
Seriously.

03:17.724 --> 03:20.911
- I love it. I can't get enough of it.
- You are so full of shit.

03:21.139 --> 03:22.889
Will you marry me, Karen?

03:25.762 --> 03:27.042
Queen of my dreams...

03:28.323 --> 03:29.873
mother of my child...

03:31.386 --> 03:32.589
lady of the valley...

03:33.788 --> 03:34.633
Any more?

03:35.324 --> 03:36.674
Fuck, now I'm out.

03:39.474 --> 03:41.139
I'm so wet right now. Are you?

03:43.303 --> 03:45.519
It must be like Niagara falls
down there?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.410
You could always
check it out for yourself.

04:36.940 --> 04:40.299
- Why am I here?
- The question that plagues us all, Mia.

04:40.419 --> 04:41.518
Why are you here?

04:41.638 --> 04:44.015
She's here because
the poor little Wunderkind

04:44.135 --> 04:46.285
is spending too much time alone.

04:46.533 --> 04:50.042
"Wunderkind"? Are we just tossing
that term around now? Really?

04:50.637 --> 04:53.385
I may be alone,
but I am far from lonely.

04:53.505 --> 04:56.273
You wouldn't believe how many Facebook
fucktards wanna be my friends.

04:56.512 --> 04:59.928
Hey, Mia, could you use
your big-girl words right now?

05:02.038 --> 05:05.509
Historically, Bill was always fine
with the creative use of profanity.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.645
- So I recall.
- But I guess you weren't.

05:08.947 --> 05:11.605
Maybe that's why things
didn't work out between you two.

05:14.822 --> 05:16.890
You see, I don't understand
why we invite her.

05:17.010 --> 05:20.156
We already have one sullen,
disrespectful she-devil in our midst.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.117
How is that any better
than the last?

05:24.279 --> 05:26.036
You said to change, I changed.

05:26.198 --> 05:27.120
Change again.

05:27.322 --> 05:28.872
You're making me mad, mother.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.209
Hank, enough!

05:32.622 --> 05:34.628
- I am making you mad?
- Allow me to defuse.

05:36.259 --> 05:37.385
Mrs. Moody?

05:38.269 --> 05:39.202
Ms...

05:39.322 --> 05:40.222
Moody.

05:40.699 --> 05:41.649
Mr. Moody.

05:42.197 --> 05:43.647
- Not so fast.
- What?

05:44.258 --> 05:46.769
- Did you hear me say yes at any point?
- You didn't have to.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.893
Your eyes said it for you.
As did the arching of your back

05:50.013 --> 05:53.312
and the soft,
gentle swell of your flower,

05:53.813 --> 05:55.296
the urgent release of...

06:00.199 --> 06:02.373
- You smell like cigarettes.
- What?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.285
No. It's Mia.

06:04.777 --> 06:06.911
Mia's been smoking. As for Becca...

06:07.072 --> 06:09.077
She'll be back to her sweet, little,

06:09.197 --> 06:11.790
unicorn-loving self in no time.
10 or 12 years, tops.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.089
- You promise?
- I promise.

06:14.932 --> 06:16.889
In the meantime,
let's focus on the good.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.768
We's getting hitched, woman.

06:18.888 --> 06:22.843
And just a few short hours ago, you had
a big, fat orgasm. This is heady stuff.

06:23.004 --> 06:24.952
Yours was pretty rockin', as well.

06:25.537 --> 06:27.453
Yes, I was concerned
for your safety.

06:27.573 --> 06:29.001
You were? How come?

06:29.121 --> 06:32.952
I was afraid that the sheer force
of my ejaculate might do some internal damage.

06:33.072 --> 06:35.772
- You okay down there?
- Don't flatter yourself.

06:36.523 --> 06:38.296
- That's him.
- Him who?

06:38.633 --> 06:39.591
The boy.

06:39.711 --> 06:42.004
What boy? You didn't
say anything about a boy.

06:42.124 --> 06:44.502
Because I didn't want
to do this for days.

06:45.484 --> 06:47.201
Go get the door.
And be nice.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.145
I'm nice. I'm always nice.
I love gentlemen callers.

06:51.014 --> 06:54.208
Fucking kid better watch his ass...
Mia? Load my shotgun.

06:54.517 --> 06:55.981
Come on!
Lipstick!

07:00.511 --> 07:02.175
- Who are you?
- Damien.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.470
What do you want?

07:05.751 --> 07:07.847
I'm here to see Becca Moody.

07:10.157 --> 07:11.476
Do you like the rap music?

07:12.862 --> 07:13.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:14.119 --> 07:15.848
- G's up.
- G's up.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.879
What about Roe V. Wade?

07:21.306 --> 07:23.905
I mean, I think
it's the woman's choice.

07:24.928 --> 07:26.365
Why should I let you in?

07:26.665 --> 07:27.851
Well, 'cause...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.870
I'd kind of really like
to get away from... them.

07:32.047 --> 07:34.582
I don't blame you.
Why are they doing that?

07:34.919 --> 07:35.875
I don't know.

07:36.394 --> 07:39.169
- It's really creeping me out.
- All right. Get inside, quick.

07:39.289 --> 07:41.677
Go play some Guitar Hero.
I'm on "medium" now...

07:41.797 --> 07:43.150
86th percentile.

07:44.377 --> 07:45.669
Hey, assholes...

07:47.406 --> 07:48.513
Break it up.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.099
We dropped some "e".

07:52.195 --> 07:53.684
You guys are fucking retarded!

07:53.844 --> 07:55.396
You're worse than Sid and Nancy.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.542
- Yeah, that's right.
- I never did it before.

07:57.662 --> 07:58.657
Me likey!

07:59.062 --> 08:00.483
Just wait till we get naked.

08:00.643 --> 08:02.325
That's something
I'm looking forward to.

08:02.445 --> 08:04.504
Here's a novel idea:
why don't you get naked

08:04.624 --> 08:07.188
and fuck yourselves goofy
in the privacy of your own home?

08:07.308 --> 08:09.487
No way. We're starving.
Let's eat.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.212
That's a very nice...

08:13.283 --> 08:14.297
shirt.

08:15.449 --> 08:17.497
Where are all
the white bitches at?

08:18.333 --> 08:19.516
There she is.

08:20.121 --> 08:22.010
- I love you so much.
- You do?

08:22.130 --> 08:23.130
Mia...

08:23.409 --> 08:25.383
How are you?
Nice to see you.

08:25.876 --> 08:27.218
Gross!
Is that a hard-on?

08:28.456 --> 08:29.800
Something poked me!

08:30.715 --> 08:33.525
- What's going on? Where are they?
- In her room.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.602
What is up with you, woman? She could be
in her 1st trimester by now.

08:38.421 --> 08:39.605
- Becca.
- Dad?

08:39.765 --> 08:41.107
Door open at all times.

08:41.267 --> 08:42.859
Get it? Got it?
Good.

08:43.097 --> 08:44.139
Damien...

08:44.376 --> 08:46.571
if that is your real name,
and I'm not convinced...

08:47.935 --> 08:50.241
... I'm watching you.
I'm not joking.

08:52.737 --> 08:55.031
Your hair is so gorgeous, Mia.

08:55.510 --> 08:58.166
I want to chop it off
and sleep in it, man.

08:59.482 --> 09:00.557
Oh, boy.

09:02.088 --> 09:03.099
My God!

09:03.497 --> 09:05.723
- I didn't have time to get changed.
- Hello, Dali!

09:05.843 --> 09:07.356
- You look gorgeous!
- Thank you!

09:07.488 --> 09:09.837
- You look gorgeous, too.
- My God.

09:09.957 --> 09:11.715
- Sorry.
- Very friendly.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.778
- You look gorgeous.
- Can I get you...

09:13.898 --> 09:15.748
- Hi, man, how are ya?
- Hi.

09:17.955 --> 09:19.632
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

09:19.752 --> 09:21.750
- You just kissed me on the lips.
- Sorry, friend.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.066
I didn't mean to stir up
any feelings you couldn't handle.

09:24.226 --> 09:26.702
No, I can handle it. I just think
it's well within my rights

09:26.822 --> 09:29.861
to not want the taste of you on my lips.
Or my lady's lips, for that matter.

09:29.981 --> 09:32.583
But thanks for the vino.
Make yourself at home.

09:33.861 --> 09:35.137
That's beautiful.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.032
My father gave her
a ring once, too.

09:38.718 --> 09:39.582
Didn't take.

09:41.002 --> 09:43.462
- Thank you, sweetie.
- So, Karen, when's the wedding?

09:43.969 --> 09:44.837
My God.

09:44.997 --> 09:47.446
He just, like, proposed to me
a couple of hours ago.

09:47.566 --> 09:50.495
You know what? If you want,
Julian can marry you.

09:50.871 --> 09:52.261
He's an ordained minister.

09:52.421 --> 09:56.515
- Why doesn't that surprise me at all?
- It's called church of the Silentdawn.

09:56.675 --> 09:58.392
And he's married so many couples.

09:59.149 --> 10:02.326
Which is odd 'cause, of course,
he sure won't, you know, marry me.

10:02.446 --> 10:05.316
Maybe the baby
is gonna change his mind.

10:06.074 --> 10:08.069
Or maybe he's just not
that into you.

10:11.659 --> 10:12.741
That's rude.

10:13.203 --> 10:14.865
Don't shoot the messenger.

10:20.471 --> 10:23.084
- Star power!
- You should come to one of my workshop.

10:23.352 --> 10:25.461
- Free of charge.
- You do workshops now?

10:25.621 --> 10:28.144
- I am down with that shit.
- See what it's about.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.094
Maybe it'll help you
with your writing.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.469
When you extract the artist within,
does he cut you a check, too?

10:33.629 --> 10:36.347
Well, I suppose you could
mock it if you want,

10:36.507 --> 10:39.533
but it does seem to be striking
a minor chord out there.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.728
He's being very modest.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.357
It's selling like Michael Jackson's
<i>Thriller</i> album. It's a great record.

10:46.764 --> 10:48.901
- Definitely one of my top 10.
- I'm glad I know.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.425
You're just printing money
over there, aren't you?

10:59.119 --> 11:00.871
That's a very nice material.
What is it?

11:01.031 --> 11:02.239
I don't know.

11:02.359 --> 11:04.417
- Is that a linen or...
- No idea.

11:07.395 --> 11:08.428
You done?

11:10.668 --> 11:12.049
You know, I'm not surprised

11:12.704 --> 11:16.049
that you attained best-seller status,
because I think you tapped into

11:16.169 --> 11:20.141
one of the biggest markets there is.
Everybody wants to feel special.

11:20.424 --> 11:21.417
They are.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.561
Even you... Hank Moody.

11:24.227 --> 11:25.995
First a kiss, now the sweet-talk.

11:26.115 --> 11:27.773
What's next, a little hand release?

11:32.424 --> 11:34.311
Will you excuse me a moment?

11:37.259 --> 11:39.944
Hey, guys, move that over.
It's a little tight.

11:43.015 --> 11:44.527
All right, that's good.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.886
- Ashby!
- Moody!

11:49.271 --> 11:50.709
What took you so long, man?

11:50.829 --> 11:52.851
Stopped to pick up some dessert.

11:52.971 --> 11:55.343
- You'll thank me later.
- Music people time.

11:57.846 --> 12:00.063
Destiny, Moody.
Moody, Destiny.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.942
Yes, we haven't been
formally introduced...

12:03.062 --> 12:05.561
You brought me
to the mouth-rapist's house?

12:05.721 --> 12:07.327
Oh, shit, from the party.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.526
I'm a fucking idiot.

12:12.033 --> 12:13.402
- Should I leave?
- Yeah.

12:13.562 --> 12:16.655
No, really. Come on, don't be silly.
What's your old lady's name again?

12:16.815 --> 12:17.865
Karen.

12:18.025 --> 12:19.617
Got it. Karen, Karen,

12:19.777 --> 12:21.542
Karen, Karen, Karen.
You ready?

12:21.721 --> 12:23.079
Come on, let's go deep.

12:33.761 --> 12:36.844
Why don't...
Does somebody want to say grace?

12:37.107 --> 12:39.552
Anybody? Damien?
No grace from you?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.597
- I'll say grace.
- Fantastic.

12:41.757 --> 12:43.196
Take it away, daughter.

12:43.551 --> 12:47.144
Can you choose your words
really carefully? Okay?

12:49.471 --> 12:51.743
I would like to thank
the Lord below

12:52.184 --> 12:55.236
for giving me the strength
to make it through this dinner.

12:55.396 --> 12:56.904
Praise hail Satan.

12:57.064 --> 12:59.067
- That was cool.
- And scary.

12:59.608 --> 13:02.557
- Seriously. I have chills.
- Can you scratch my back, baby?

13:03.036 --> 13:04.313
That's interesting.

13:06.099 --> 13:07.373
That feels amazing.

13:07.533 --> 13:10.315
Becca's going through
a bit of a phase right now.

13:11.018 --> 13:12.898
- It's not a phase, mother.
- I know.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.212
- It's my religion.
- Also she's willing to suffer for it.

13:15.332 --> 13:17.289
She was sent
to the principal's office

13:17.409 --> 13:20.010
the other day
for possessing a Satanic Bible.

13:20.170 --> 13:23.347
Nothing like sending your kid
to a "progressive" private school

13:23.507 --> 13:26.475
- that wants to burn your kid's books.
- Yeah, but, then again,

13:26.794 --> 13:28.796
they might be right
to raise an eyebrow.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.011
After all...

13:30.687 --> 13:32.815
- Where does it end?
- What do you mean?

13:32.975 --> 13:35.408
Well, it's all well and good
to indulge your children,

13:35.528 --> 13:37.027
but to endorse a point of view

13:37.187 --> 13:38.608
that profanes every...

13:38.728 --> 13:42.201
sacrosanct concept
in our culture is wrong, no?

13:42.370 --> 13:45.119
I think it's time to put
Sir Walter Raleigh back in the can.

13:46.363 --> 13:47.746
- Well...
- Honey...

13:47.906 --> 13:49.617
- it's none of our business.
- Chapter 4:

13:49.742 --> 13:51.375
lose your filter, find your way.

13:51.535 --> 13:53.829
- How could I forget?
- Did somebody say "Gefilte"?

13:53.949 --> 13:55.379
Have you read it?

13:56.926 --> 13:59.435
- Excuse me?
- Have you read the book?

13:59.971 --> 14:01.816
I don't think I need to, honey.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.764
Don't "honey" me, mister.

14:04.298 --> 14:07.544
The Satanic Bible is actually
the ultimate self-help book.

14:07.664 --> 14:09.893
It's not about
worshipping the devil.

14:10.161 --> 14:13.123
It's about believing in yourself
first and foremost

14:13.388 --> 14:16.217
and not wasting your time
on psychic vampires.

14:16.902 --> 14:18.998
If you read it,
you might learn a thing or two

14:19.118 --> 14:21.167
because it actually makes
a hell of a lot more sense

14:21.308 --> 14:22.990
than the Gobbledygook
you're passing off

14:23.150 --> 14:25.743
on the average, everyday
Barnes & Noble bottom-feeder.

14:26.103 --> 14:28.287
That's right...
I've read your book.

14:28.898 --> 14:30.467
I want my money back.

14:30.587 --> 14:31.742
O-tay!

14:32.826 --> 14:34.824
I don't know about you guys,
but I think

14:34.944 --> 14:37.254
that deserves a slow handclap.

14:39.925 --> 14:41.967
- That's rude.
- Bravo!

14:42.127 --> 14:43.385
No, no. Stop.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.903
That girl's magic.
What's her name?

14:47.023 --> 14:48.057
Becca.

14:48.507 --> 14:50.809
So when are you due, sweetie?

14:50.969 --> 14:54.355
- You are pregnant, right?
- Oh, no. Yeah. I am pregnant.

14:54.515 --> 14:56.482
- Yes, I am.
- Congratulations!

14:56.642 --> 14:59.041
Thank you. And my due date
is not far enough away.

14:59.161 --> 15:01.111
Did you guys have fun trying,
or did you have

15:01.271 --> 15:03.499
to beat off into a test tube
or something?

15:04.692 --> 15:07.018
I'm just asking.
I mean, people do that shit...

15:07.450 --> 15:09.286
stuff... a lot nowadays.

15:09.737 --> 15:12.706
No, well, this happened
the old-fashioned way.

15:13.816 --> 15:16.534
You gave her a little bit of the
old artist within, didn't you?

15:16.654 --> 15:17.662
Salty dog.

15:18.098 --> 15:20.079
Actually,
I'm not the father.

15:21.709 --> 15:23.968
- Not the father?
- Oh, my God.

15:24.128 --> 15:25.741
I had no idea.
I'm sorry.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.979
I have no secrets.
There is no shame.

15:30.754 --> 15:34.505
But when we met,
Sonja was already pregnant.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.240
I could smell it on her.

15:36.409 --> 15:37.486
Smell it?

15:39.601 --> 15:41.110
Yeah, yeah. Really.

15:41.270 --> 15:43.737
He is serious.
I didn't know and...

15:44.087 --> 15:45.373
That's... possible.

15:46.430 --> 15:48.289
Yeah, yeah.
I know, right?

15:48.819 --> 15:51.245
It was quite
a weird first date, it was.

15:51.482 --> 15:56.172
I'll raise the child as my own.
And I'll love it as my own.

15:56.408 --> 15:58.342
I think that is awesome.

15:58.765 --> 16:02.548
This is a grown man willing to stand up
and take responsibility

16:02.708 --> 16:04.296
for another man's seed.

16:04.835 --> 16:06.291
- Big ups...
- Thank you.

16:06.411 --> 16:07.472
Mad love...

16:07.913 --> 16:10.045
- Much respect.
- Marcy... what is she doing?

16:10.758 --> 16:13.225
So you have no idea
who the father is?

16:13.710 --> 16:15.603
I'm not that big a slut, Karen.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.272
- No! I...
- No one's judging.

16:18.527 --> 16:20.195
No one's judging, baby girl.

16:20.315 --> 16:22.892
- Some of my favorite humans are sluts.
- My wife is a slut.

16:23.012 --> 16:25.559
I personally don't believe in that word.
I think that a woman

16:25.679 --> 16:29.116
who indulges herself sexually should
be celebrated and not condemned.

16:29.276 --> 16:31.603
Hey, chapter seven...
"Let a ho be a ho," right?

16:31.810 --> 16:33.709
- That's right!
- Amen to that, my brother.

16:33.829 --> 16:36.030
That's exactly what
the Satanic Bible would say.

16:36.150 --> 16:37.192
Hail satan!

16:37.471 --> 16:39.418
There was only one guy,
according to Sonja.

16:39.927 --> 16:42.620
And you know, she was lonely.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.320
He was there.

16:44.757 --> 16:47.097
You needed a little positive
reinforcement, didn't you?

16:47.217 --> 16:49.094
And he gave you that.

16:49.546 --> 16:51.802
So, there is nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:51.974 --> 16:53.223
We all do it.

16:53.383 --> 16:57.336
The point is to rise above it
and to love ourselves.

16:57.456 --> 16:58.687
Totally, totally.

16:59.126 --> 17:00.750
You just come up with that shit

17:00.881 --> 17:02.900
or do you have cue cards
written somewhere?

17:05.742 --> 17:08.729
So I'm just doing
a little mental math over here,

17:08.848 --> 17:10.616
and I think

17:10.926 --> 17:12.915
what you're saying, Sonja...

17:13.595 --> 17:15.704
And correct me if I'm wrong...

17:16.637 --> 17:19.700
But that Hank could very well be
the father of the child.

17:19.819 --> 17:22.050
Because you guys
definitely bumped uglies

17:22.170 --> 17:24.483
that one night
at my father's, right?

17:26.415 --> 17:27.675
You wear a cock bag?

17:29.453 --> 17:31.261
Nope.
He hates rubbers.

17:31.421 --> 17:33.347
Yeah. Me too.
I can't feel a damn thing.

17:33.507 --> 17:34.598
I love rubbers.

17:34.758 --> 17:36.934
- Keeps him in the game.
- Keeps me in the game.

17:40.170 --> 17:41.983
God, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

17:42.908 --> 17:44.566
I didn't want it
to come out like this.

17:48.515 --> 17:50.449
I've been trying to find
a way to tell you.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.091
But it doesn't matter.

17:52.609 --> 17:55.202
You know, I mean,
I want this baby no matter what.

17:58.038 --> 18:01.491
Dude, this is my favorite dinner party
ever. I'm so glad I came.

18:02.668 --> 18:04.721
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

18:04.841 --> 18:06.839
but I think a cheers is in order.

18:07.398 --> 18:10.676
To yet another fine mess.
Good job!

18:10.836 --> 18:12.234
I'll drink to that.

18:14.236 --> 18:15.222
Well done.

18:18.094 --> 18:19.093
Let's go.

18:22.806 --> 18:24.250
To fine messes...

18:24.808 --> 18:26.065
and new daddies.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.901
What the fuck?

18:47.623 --> 18:50.716
- This is my daughter's bedroom!
- I know. Chick's got great taste.

18:50.876 --> 18:54.045
Have you no sense of shame?
Get the fuck out of here!

18:54.165 --> 18:57.097
You know better.
Marcy... Jesus Christ, Charlie.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.400
Motherfucker left a floater.

19:25.235 --> 19:27.163
Game on, broheim.
I get it.

19:27.804 --> 19:29.342
I read you, brother.

19:31.332 --> 19:32.925
I hear you talking to me.

19:43.594 --> 19:44.394
Hi.

19:45.383 --> 19:47.481
Hey, you know what?
The fucking

19:47.641 --> 19:50.442
"artist within" left
us a turd within our toilet.

19:50.562 --> 19:52.402
Can you believe that shit?
Literally?

19:52.562 --> 19:54.932
It's like he's taking a dump
on top of my head.

19:55.052 --> 19:58.063
I'm reading him loud and clear.
it's a thing between him and me.

19:58.183 --> 20:00.508
And I think it involves you.
Youinflamed him in some way.

20:00.628 --> 20:03.121
Now it's like "Jaws 3." It's personal.
You want a bump?

20:05.223 --> 20:07.459
Are you ready
to talk about it now?

20:08.238 --> 20:09.419
What was that?

20:13.806 --> 20:16.206
What's he on?
The coke, I know. What else?

20:16.326 --> 20:19.096
Nothing. He did a few lines,
had a few drinks, that's it.

20:19.256 --> 20:20.378
Get the pen.

20:20.863 --> 20:22.014
- The pen.
- The pen.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.338
I got it.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.937
Get the pen! The pen!

20:30.016 --> 20:31.016
Fuck!

20:31.873 --> 20:33.554
My God! What... What...

20:45.516 --> 20:47.288
I hate when that happens.

20:51.896 --> 20:53.612
What the fuck was that?

20:54.085 --> 20:55.382
Food allergies.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.797
Bane of my fucking existence.

20:59.785 --> 21:01.388
Did you eat any of that sashimi?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.808
And then you shoved your tongue
down my throat.

21:05.384 --> 21:06.576
There you go.

21:07.888 --> 21:09.938
Thanks, pal.
You saved my life.

21:11.435 --> 21:13.275
Hey, what'd you do with that coke?

21:15.395 --> 21:17.195
You know you can always crash
at my house.

21:17.355 --> 21:19.730
Thank you, but I don't think
that'll be necessary.

21:19.850 --> 21:23.115
I don't know, man. I know chicks.
This looks like some serious,

21:23.235 --> 21:25.621
extreme doghouse shit
right here.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.447
- Ready, darling?
- Yep.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.879
- Where are you going?
- They're giving me a ride.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.514
- Maybe stop for a drink.
- Works for me. The other room?

21:35.634 --> 21:37.001
- Great.
- Okay.

21:38.449 --> 21:39.885
Good night, Mia.

21:40.393 --> 21:41.471
Good night.

21:45.396 --> 21:46.350
Come here.

21:46.675 --> 21:48.427
You be cool with her because she's...

21:48.547 --> 21:51.513
she doesn't seem like it,
but she's kind of a fragile flower.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.481
All right? So play nice.

21:53.642 --> 21:55.678
Look, I have many vices,
my friend,

21:55.798 --> 21:58.077
but jailbait ain't one of 'em.

21:58.197 --> 22:00.973
Well, I mean, there was that one time
in Salt Lake City,

22:01.093 --> 22:04.124
but that was like a Mormon
mother/daughter thing.

22:04.632 --> 22:06.139
Pretty fucking hot.

22:07.336 --> 22:10.709
I pull that out of the spank bank
every once in a while.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.725
- Mind if I borrow it?
- You know where I live.

22:17.577 --> 22:19.731
- Mr. Moody.
- That sounds weird.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.594
Call me "he who will kill you
if you touch his daughter."

22:23.100 --> 22:23.929
Right.

22:24.616 --> 22:25.616
I get it.

22:25.984 --> 22:27.391
She's pretty awesome.

22:27.765 --> 22:29.977
She is.
But thank you for saying that.

22:30.905 --> 22:32.597
Do you need a ride home
or something?

22:33.484 --> 22:35.611
No, I walked.
I live close-by.

22:36.258 --> 22:37.926
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

22:38.046 --> 22:40.028
So I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other.

22:40.309 --> 22:41.471
Don't push it.

22:41.731 --> 22:43.079
Goodbye forever.

22:52.909 --> 22:55.919
I told you we should have called
the whole thing off.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.700
Then we wouldn't have gotten
the happy news.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.860
The man with the fresh vasectomy

23:01.124 --> 23:02.791
is about to be a daddy.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.432
- You caught me.
- Yeah.

23:12.394 --> 23:14.865
At least you can see
the comedy in all of this.

23:14.985 --> 23:17.732
Oh, right.
I either laugh or I cry, right?

23:18.245 --> 23:19.247
Or both.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.989
Maybe I'm PMS'ing, but I feel
like I could use a good cry.

23:26.414 --> 23:28.481
I'm not...
I'm not mad at you.

23:30.954 --> 23:33.266
How is that
even remotely possible?

23:36.660 --> 23:40.276
'Cause this isn't about anything
you did while we were apart.

23:40.906 --> 23:42.676
This is about what I did.

23:44.181 --> 23:46.318
- I made a huge mistake.
- No.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.972
- Don't say that. You didn't.
- I did.

23:49.133 --> 23:51.445
I jumped in the car with you
that night.

23:51.565 --> 23:53.130
Then we came back here

23:53.549 --> 23:54.808
and we had sex.

23:55.549 --> 23:57.405
And then we just... we just

23:57.750 --> 24:00.012
tried to pick up where
we left off.

24:00.132 --> 24:02.481
I mean, do you have
any idea how...

24:03.199 --> 24:05.155
fucking dysfunctional that is?

24:07.812 --> 24:10.037
You know, silly me, 'cause I'm...

24:10.580 --> 24:13.789
I'm sitting here thinking
that it's like a dream come true.

24:14.524 --> 24:16.556
It was.
It was a dream.

24:17.199 --> 24:18.881
But we were crazy, Hank.

24:19.337 --> 24:21.864
Like thinking we could just
wave a magic wand

24:21.984 --> 24:24.727
and everything would be as it was.
I mean...

24:25.471 --> 24:26.301
If...

24:26.584 --> 24:27.627
It was...

24:28.075 --> 24:30.826
Ever as we think it was,
if you know what I mean.

24:30.946 --> 24:32.490
Right. Because we...

24:33.436 --> 24:35.376
we just imagined everything.

24:36.939 --> 24:39.007
We can't do this to her anymore.

24:39.697 --> 24:42.116
You know, we've been reckless
with her heart.

24:42.236 --> 24:43.922
- Or I have.
- No, no.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.329
It's my fault.
I should've gone away,

24:46.449 --> 24:48.406
- gotten my sh...
- You're a wonderful mother.

24:50.110 --> 24:51.110
Always.

24:54.239 --> 24:56.043
I will never, ever...

24:56.390 --> 24:59.842
Regret getting into the car
with you that night, 'cause...

25:00.161 --> 25:01.700
It was so much fun.

25:02.798 --> 25:05.803
And marrying Bill
was definitely not the answer.

25:09.081 --> 25:10.081
I don't...

25:10.969 --> 25:12.639
Know how to say this, but...

25:12.799 --> 25:13.799
Don't.

25:18.997 --> 25:20.906
... neither is marrying you.

25:26.617 --> 25:28.914
- This isn't the answer either,
- No.

25:29.034 --> 25:30.036
you know?

25:35.733 --> 25:37.981
Angel, I love you so, so much.

25:42.866 --> 25:44.075
I can't stay.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.391
I'm not asking you to.

25:54.044 --> 25:55.056
I can't stay.

26:14.276 --> 26:17.586
- I'm gonna go out for a little while.
- It's okay, dad.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.164
You tried your best.

26:22.693 --> 26:24.637
It was nice while it lasted.

26:25.305 --> 26:31.762
