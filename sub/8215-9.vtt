*

00:14.180 --> 00:15.135
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.078
Excuse me.
Coming through.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.247
MAN 2:
Look out. Look out.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.748
Let's go. Let's go.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.145
Come on, hurry.
Hurry up.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.114
All right,
let's go, cross.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.481
Cut them off.
Cut them off.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.351
All right, come on, come on.
Give me the card.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.618
Give me the clue card.
Excuse me, please.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.649
All right, people,
come on.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.055
Whoops, sorry.
Sorry, sir.

00:30.090 --> 00:30.920
WOMAN: Sorry.
On a scavenger hunt.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.757
MAN :
All right, all right.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.190
We're looking for a...
Hans von Aachen,

00:36.230 --> 00:37.162
16th century,

00:37.200 --> 00:39.134
German painter.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.367
All right. Born 1552.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.298
1550, Paul, right here.
It's an access code.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.659
All right.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.235
1552.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.202
Let's go.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.138
Spread out. Spread out.
Take the left.

00:52.180 --> 00:55.274
The painting's called
"St. George and the Dragon."

00:55.320 --> 00:58.847
So we're looking for
St. George or a dragon.

00:58.890 --> 00:59.811
WOMAN:
Nothing here!

00:59.860 --> 01:01.157
Dragon. Dragon. Dragon.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.622
Over here!
Right here! Look here!

01:03.660 --> 01:05.082
Dragon. Dragon. Dragon...
All right. All right.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.290
What's that
Right there.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.649
MAN 2: He's got it!
It's over here!

01:07.700 --> 01:09.190
Look, the final clue--
right in it's mouth.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.091
Oh, man, that's terrible.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.289
MAN 2: Check that out!
WOMAN: That's awful!

01:14.340 --> 01:15.432
Definitely gonna slow us down.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.804
So, here's the deal.
Okay.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.603
I'm gonna do
some combinations--

01:22.650 --> 01:24.277
Mm-hmm.
kicks, punches, jabs...

01:24.310 --> 01:25.402
some elbows.

01:25.450 --> 01:28.112
You have to repeat it
back to me perfectly.
Oh...

01:28.150 --> 01:29.515
Can't miss a beat.
Okay.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.414
Now, if you do screw up...

01:30.450 --> 01:32.156
you got to drop
and give me ten push-ups.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.316
That's what
we're doing today.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.850
That's a totally one-sided deal
that I would never accept.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.289
How about this?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.627
How about you show me
a combination

01:37.660 --> 01:41.289
and if I repeat it
perfectly,
Mm-hmm.

01:41.330 --> 01:44.595
You drop and give me 50.

01:44.630 --> 01:45.824
50. Yeah, okay.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.758
I'm in the mood for that.
All right, you good?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.199
Let's do it. Deal.
Let's do it.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.368
*

02:17.270 --> 02:18.396
Come on.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.230
VVhack!

02:30.910 --> 02:32.548
Forty-nine...

02:32.580 --> 02:33.774
Fifty.
Very...

02:33.820 --> 02:35.913
Okay.
nice.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.417
I surrender.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.179
Good.
That wa...
that was impressive.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.256
Looks like you got the
workout of your life, huh?

02:41.290 --> 02:43.383
Yeah. And you didn't
miss a single punch.
No.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.419
I guess I underestimated
my opponent.
Well...

02:45.560 --> 02:47.619
Great, great job.
That was...
Yeah, which is a...

02:47.660 --> 02:48.649
dangerous thing to do.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.327
Yeah.
You know?

02:50.370 --> 02:51.860
Well, you know, hey,
maybe I should, um...

02:51.900 --> 02:53.788
maybe I should get to know
my opponent better.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.898
Maybe, some,
some dinner.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.237
Sometime.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.965
Oh, uh...
Whatever, I mean...

02:58.010 --> 02:59.307
Igotta...
Uh...

02:59.340 --> 03:00.329
I'll see you next week.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.870
Hey, Al. What's up?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.340
AL:
The body was found

03:05.380 --> 03:06.415
right under where
the last clue was

03:06.450 --> 03:08.714
in the scavenger hunt
for charity.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.286
Victim is
Jebediah Cosgrove,

03:10.320 --> 03:11.548
of Cosgrove Strategies,

03:11.590 --> 03:13.683
worth over a billion dollars.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.257
His company sponsors
the scavenger hunt.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.427
CARRIE:
Hey, Jo.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.484
What happened?

03:18.530 --> 03:20.350
Victim was shot five times.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.425
Still had his wallet.
Only thing missing is his phone.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.594
What is that?

03:27.640 --> 03:28.664
What, a footprint?

03:28.700 --> 03:30.304
The killers?

03:30.340 --> 03:32.308
Well, based on the
congealing of the blood,

03:32.340 --> 03:34.433
I'd say this footprint was
made way after the killing.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.345
Who called it in?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.644
This jerk over here.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.942
He stepped over the body
to get the clue...

03:39.980 --> 03:41.345
and then he called it in.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.818
Excuse me.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.652
Hey.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.555
You were part of
the scavenger hunt?

03:50.590 --> 03:52.023
Yeah.
Won the scavenger hunt.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.550
You won the scavenger hunt?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.749
Wow! How about that?

03:54.800 --> 03:56.028
He won the scavenger hunt.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.891
Let me see your boots.
My boots?

03:57.930 --> 04:00.763
Yeah, those $2,000
Peruvian suede boots

04:00.800 --> 04:02.961
that you used to
step over a dead body

04:03.010 --> 04:04.466
to win the scavenger hunt.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.637
Take his boots.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.829
Uh... no.
Uh, yeah.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.472
No, no, no, no.
No, you can't take my boots.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.375
Bag 'em.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.274
MAN:
Okay, this is insane.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.571
I came back here to
talk to you guys.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.973
You think I killed Jeb Cosgrove?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.840
Look, I got video to back it up.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.585
I gotta get to work, okay?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.349
My driver's waiting.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.426
Why don't you
have your driver meet you

04:22.460 --> 04:24.428
at One Police Plaza?
Take him.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.853
Guys like that are gonna
run the country's finances,

04:27.900 --> 04:30.562
I'm gonna keep my money
under my mattress.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.022
AL:
A guy as rich as Cosgrove--

04:32.070 --> 04:33.367
we follow the money.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.493
It's all about
the $1 billion.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.885
JAY: We're looking at the
footage of the scavenger hunt.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.626
Cosgrove Strategies donates
a million bucks to charity

04:57.660 --> 04:59.082
in the name of
the wmnlng team.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.028
Every team, by rule,

05:00.060 --> 05:01.823
has to record
every second of the game.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.623
News flash:
Wall Street guys cheat.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.921
I have already combed through

05:04.970 --> 05:07.530
18 hours of footage
from De Klerk's team.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.663
Which clears them as murders,
but not as human beings.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.508
I still have
161 other teams

05:12.540 --> 05:14.508
to scour through
and once I'm done,

05:14.540 --> 05:16.030
I would love to be
considered for detective.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.071
JAY:
I'm 100% in favor of that.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.511
Scour away, Investigator.

05:21.550 --> 05:24.917
When the CEO of a $30 billion
company gets murdered;

05:24.950 --> 05:27.384
it makes this
a three-migraine day for me.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.019
Any news on
Cosgrove's missing phone?

05:30.060 --> 05:31.925
It's got to be turned on
before I can track it.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.359
What do you have
on the family?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.628
Uh, Camille Cosgrove...

05:34.660 --> 05:36.389
second wife.

05:36.430 --> 05:37.988
Second wife?
What's the story with

05:38.030 --> 05:39.019
the first wife?

05:39.070 --> 05:40.697
She died 16 years ago.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.469
Natural causes; not suspicious.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.602
If there wasn't a prenup,

05:43.640 --> 05:45.039
second wife's worth a good part
of the billion dollars.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.708
That's_a ton of motive
right there.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.571
Cosgrove had a son, Marshall,
from his first marriage.

05:48.610 --> 05:49.838
He stands to inherit as well.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.040
ELIOT:
Yeah, but why kill

05:51.080 --> 05:52.718
the golden goose?

05:52.750 --> 05:54.570
You know what's worth more
than a billion?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.019
$30 billion.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.881
Who takes over
Cosgrove Strategies?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.456
That would be me.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.718
So, Mr. Powels--

06:00.760 --> 06:02.625
Cameron, please.
First names and handshakes here.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.025
Aw, that's catchy.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.858
That was Jeb's philosophy;
he taught me a lot.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.652
Sounds like
you were close.

06:08.700 --> 06:09.667
We weren't just close,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.065
he was my best friend.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.988
I loved the man.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.565
In 20 years,
I only saw him mad once--

06:15.600 --> 06:17.602
at a broker he found
bending the rules.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.732
Do you have a name
for that broker?

06:18.770 --> 06:19.930
Yeah.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.936
Me.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.042
Jeb really loved this view.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.115
So, you're the, uh...

06:28.150 --> 06:29.481
controlling partner now, huh?

06:29.520 --> 06:31.738
Reluctantly, but yes.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.655
Can I ask where were
you last night?

06:33.690 --> 06:35.112
You mean,
did I kill the only man

06:35.160 --> 06:36.923
who ever gave me
a second chance?

06:36.960 --> 06:38.188
I was here...

06:38.230 --> 06:39.891
helping to run
the scavenger hunt

06:39.930 --> 06:41.022
all night--

06:41.060 --> 06:42.698
on camera, I'm sure.

06:42.730 --> 06:43.697
We're gonna need that video.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.890
Take whatever you like.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.034
AL:
How about rival firms

06:47.070 --> 06:48.628
or business deals
that went sour?

06:48.670 --> 06:50.206
Jeb didn't make enemies.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.879
$30 billion investment bank
and no enemies?

06:52.910 --> 06:53.831
I don't buy it.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.632
Do you know why
the market fell this morning?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.444
Because everybody
respected Jeb.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.948
How about the much younger
second wife?

07:00.980 --> 07:02.709
Camille? She's lovely.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.115
And they seem to be

07:04.150 --> 07:05.742
happy with their arrangement.

07:05.790 --> 07:06.757
Arrangement?

07:08.260 --> 07:09.625
When it comes to the corporation

07:09.660 --> 07:11.127
or our financial positions...

07:11.160 --> 07:12.696
I'm the guy to speak to.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.749
you'll need to
speak to Camille.

07:16.930 --> 07:18.659
HIBBERT:
He warned us, that the bubble

07:18.700 --> 07:21.533
was about to burst,
but did anybody listen?

07:21.570 --> 07:24.130
No, they called him
Chicken Little.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.706
And then the slq fell.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.970
And afterwards...

07:28.010 --> 07:29.978
did he ever say,
"I told you so"?

07:30.010 --> 07:32.672
No, not Jeb.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.711
If there were more
Jeb Cosgroves,

07:34.750 --> 07:36.843
the financial crisis
would never have happened.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.609
He proved that you
didn't have to be horrible...

07:39.660 --> 07:40.718
I'll interview
the pretty widow.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.216
Of course you will.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.784
I'll take the son.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.684
And he never once
called me "Mr. Hibbert."

07:45.730 --> 07:47.698
It was always "John."
First names...

07:47.730 --> 07:48.697
and handshakes.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.618
To Jeb.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.728
ALL:
To Jeb.

07:51.770 --> 07:54.694
Well, there's your pretty widow.

07:54.740 --> 07:55.729
POWELS :
But about Jeb's

07:55.770 --> 07:56.737
personal life...

07:56.770 --> 07:57.930
you need to speak to Camille.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.801
Remember that arrangement
Powels was telling us about?

08:01.840 --> 08:02.841
Mm-hmm.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.609
That's the guy.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.639
How do you know?

08:08.220 --> 08:09.687
Oh, I just know.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.142
Go get her.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.187
Excuse me.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.255
Hey. Um...

08:15.290 --> 08:16.689
could you tell me
where I'd find

08:16.730 --> 08:17.822
Marshall Cosgrove?

08:17.860 --> 08:19.157
He's on the
rooftop terrace.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.157
There?
Mm-hmm.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.849
Thanks.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.792
Hey, Marshall?

08:25.830 --> 08:27.991
Hey.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.565
I'm Carrie Wells,
I'm, uh...

08:30.610 --> 08:31.759
I'm here to help
find out

08:31.810 --> 08:33.778
what happened
to your dad.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.630
You mind if I sit?

08:35.680 --> 08:38.205
Thanks.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.541
Mrs. Cosgrove?

08:42.590 --> 08:43.648
Camille.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.282
First names, got it.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.787
Lieutenant A! Burns.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.287
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.878
Thank you.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.818
Are you investigating
who killed Jeb?

08:51.860 --> 08:53.054
Yes.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.897
I know this is
a difficult time,

08:54.930 --> 08:56.124
but I do have a few questions,

08:56.160 --> 08:57.229
if that's okay?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.521
Anything to help.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.531
Okay.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.760
I'm sorry. And you are?

09:05.810 --> 09:07.277
Robert Chavez.

09:07.310 --> 09:08.937
Lieutenant A! Burns.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.800
And your relation to the family?

09:10.850 --> 09:12.272
Camille's boyfriend.

09:12.310 --> 09:16.076
I wasn't aware you
and your husband were separated.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.712
We weren't.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.918
Was Mr. Cosgrove-- Jeb--

09:21.960 --> 09:23.780
aware you were
seeing someone else?

09:23.830 --> 09:25.058
Of course.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.853
Jeb and I had an open marriage.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.664
Everyone here
knows about it.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.792
Although...

09:30.830 --> 09:32.320
some are
uncomfortable with it.

09:32.370 --> 09:33.894
I know our lifestyle
seems strange,

09:33.940 --> 09:35.828
especially in this context, Al,

09:35.870 --> 09:37.701
but it has nothing to do
with Jeb's murder.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.937
Were you and Jeb close?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.948
I know where
you're going with this.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.208
But I date Camille.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.810
Jeb had his own girlfriends
through the years,

09:46.850 --> 09:48.772
and Jeb, his girlfriends,
Camille and I, we...

09:48.820 --> 09:50.139
we'd all vacation together.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.839
This isn't _
a new relationship.

09:51.890 --> 09:54.256
We've been together
for seven years.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.315
Seven years.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.022
Excuse me for asking,
but why even be married?

09:59.060 --> 10:01.096
Because I love my husband
very much.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.291
Our marriage meant something.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.366
I also love Robert.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.958
Is this really a good time

10:07.000 --> 10:08.695
to be questioning
a widow?

10:08.740 --> 10:10.207
At her husband's
memorial?

10:10.240 --> 10:12.674
There's never a good time,
Mr. Chavez.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.972
You know,

10:14.010 --> 10:15.329
I understand a couple

10:15.380 --> 10:17.302
trying to spice up
their relationship, but....

10:17.350 --> 10:19.147
what did you
get out of the deal?

10:19.180 --> 10:20.909
I got this
beautiful woman.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.372
I got two best friends.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.183
Comfort.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.380
And love.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.957
And all this.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.720
Look, I'm an educator...

10:30.760 --> 10:32.159
and I know how
this sounds, but yes,

10:32.190 --> 10:34.055
I was able to live a lifestyle
that was...

10:34.100 --> 10:35.658
far beyond my means.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.122
Were you two together
last night?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.388
Yes, Camille and I spent the
night together at the Waldorf.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.365
If everybody was so cool
with the arrangement...

10:42.400 --> 10:44.004
why check into a hotel?

10:44.040 --> 10:45.667
Plenty of room here.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.076
CAMILLE:
We adults all understood
the situation.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.169
But it wasn't as easy
on Marshall.

10:52.180 --> 10:55.445
Camille and Mr. Chavez
called It an open marriage.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.788
Their friends
think it's weird,

10:56.820 --> 10:58.014
but they're all dating
other people

10:58.050 --> 10:59.017
at the same time, too.

10:59.050 --> 11:01.416
Do you think it's weird?

11:01.460 --> 11:04.258
I'm kind of used to it.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.920
You know, but now,

11:06.960 --> 11:09.053
it's like I'm left
with a stepmother

11:09.100 --> 11:11.193
and Mr. Chavez.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.061
Right.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.702
You keep calling
him Mr. Chavez.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.002
That seems kind of formal.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.270
It would weird
to call him Robert at home.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.937
At school,
it has to be Mr. Chavez.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.949
Wait, I'm sorry--
he works at your school?

11:24.980 --> 11:26.914
Yeah, he's the vice principal.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.043
Dad got him the job there.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.081
Let me get this straight:

11:30.120 --> 11:32.247
You, um...

11:32.290 --> 11:34.053
Your dad got

11:34.090 --> 11:36.411
your stepmother's
boyfriend a job

11:36.460 --> 11:38.428
at the school
that you go to?

11:38.460 --> 11:41.327
Wow, they didn't make it
easy on you, did they?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.736
You were with your dad
last night, right?

11:49.770 --> 11:50.930
Sure.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.232
It was just him and me,

11:52.270 --> 11:53.908
until he left for
the scavenger hunt.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.976
Anything happen
before he left?

11:56.010 --> 11:57.477
Anything unusual...?

11:59.280 --> 12:00.872
Well, there was
this thing with Doc.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.944
Doc?

12:01.980 --> 12:04.039
My favorite teacher, Doc Reid.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.284
Or he was my favorite.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.878
What happened?

12:06.920 --> 12:08.808
Uh...

12:08.860 --> 12:10.350
Uh, Doc gave me
a bad recommendation

12:10.390 --> 12:11.823
on my college application.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.090
My dad was angry

12:14.130 --> 12:16.018
and wanted to know
what Doc's deal was.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.493
So... he invited him over.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.122
What happened?

12:19.170 --> 12:21.991
I couldn't hear
anything, but...

12:22.040 --> 12:23.359
my dad seemed
pissed afterwards.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.937
I mean, you don't
think Doc...?

12:26.980 --> 12:29.369
I don't know.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.378
But I'm gonna
find out, okay?

12:40.820 --> 12:42.412
37th Prep.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.849
No, I don't think that
should be a problem.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.426
I see, but...
We're here to
see Dr. Reid.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.529
GUARD:
Uh, just a minute.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.096
Hold on one moment.

12:49.130 --> 12:50.097
You on the list?

12:51.230 --> 12:53.198
Nope, don't look like

12:53.240 --> 12:56.368
Doc Reid has any guests
on the list. Uh...

12:56.400 --> 12:58.038
How about you make
an exception for us?

12:58.070 --> 12:59.799
Down the hall,

12:59.840 --> 13:01.137
to the right.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.533
Thank you.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.969
Hey, Al,
Powels' alibi holds up.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.978
He_ was at the office the whole
night of the scavenger hunt.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.011
He's a rich guy.
Could've hired a hit man.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.312
JAY: He could've,
so I'll keep digging.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.988
Oh, and check this:
the boyfriend,

13:12.020 --> 13:13.510
Chavez, was telling the truth.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.016
Two bartenders, a bar-back

13:15.060 --> 13:17.153
and two waitresses
at the Waldorf all confirm

13:17.190 --> 13:19.078
that Chavez and Camille
were watching the Mets game

13:19.130 --> 13:20.427
at the hotel bar all night long.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.155
All right, thanks.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.497
Mets game?

13:23.530 --> 13:24.929
Thought opening
up your marriage

13:24.970 --> 13:26.494
was supposed to be sew.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.168
You know, for someone
who's never been married,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.839
you have an awful lot of
opinions about open marriages.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.167
Well, I won't
be vacationing

13:32.210 --> 13:33.438
with you and your
Secret Service guy,

13:33.480 --> 13:35.505
I can tell you that.
Well, that's
'cause you know

13:35.540 --> 13:36.871
how those
Secret Service guys

13:36.910 --> 13:38.502
can really
rock a Speedo.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.110
He seems like the type
that would wear a Speedo.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.348
Yeah.

13:48.390 --> 13:49.982
Dr. Reid?

13:54.530 --> 13:55.758
Doctor...

13:59.630 --> 14:01.063
He's dead.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.168
Clear.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.373
Looks like Doc had
a guest after all.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.284
Yes. Of...
Yes, of course, Mr. Mayor.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.548
The-the Cosgrove case

14:20.590 --> 14:24.026
is a priority
over here. It...

14:24.060 --> 14:25.379
No, it is the...
I'm sorry,

14:25.430 --> 14:26.624
it is the priority.

14:26.660 --> 14:27.922
That is what I meant to say.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.025
I... I understand,

14:31.070 --> 14:32.628
which is why I am
personally handling

14:32.670 --> 14:35.935
every facet of
this investigation.

14:35.970 --> 14:36.937
Yes.

14:36.970 --> 14:38.164
At this time, we believe

14:38.210 --> 14:39.438
the killing at 37th Prep

14:39.470 --> 14:40.676
was related.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.405
Uh, the victim, Reid,

14:42.440 --> 14:45.170
seems to have known
Cosgrove's son, uh...

14:45.210 --> 14:47.519
Mare... Marshall.

14:47.550 --> 14:50.610
Uh, he apparently
taught the boy...

14:50.650 --> 14:52.584
uh, in physics.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.612
Well, of course
I realize

14:55.660 --> 14:59.027
how important the-the school
is to the city.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.153
And yes,
I understand

15:01.200 --> 15:04.067
how worried the
parents must be.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.522
Yeah.

15:05.570 --> 15:08.198
As a matter of fact,
I did know

15:08.240 --> 15:09.491
that Jeffrey
Tollison's kids

15:09.540 --> 15:10.700
were at
37th Prep.

15:10.740 --> 15:12.935
They are wonderful boys...
and a girl.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.470
Uh, seventh
and ninth grade.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.603
They are great kids.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.507
Yes. As a matter of fact,

15:19.550 --> 15:23.042
we do have a
person of Interest.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.114
He is an assistant

15:24.150 --> 15:25.447
principal at the school.

15:25.490 --> 15:28.084
Chavez-- his name is
Robert Chavez.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.429
Uh, he's been at
Prep for six years.

15:30.460 --> 15:34.226
He, uh, apparently has had
some sort of relationship

15:34.260 --> 15:38.094
with, uh,
Jeb Cosgrove's wife, Camille.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.960
No... No, I am notjudging, sir.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.230
I would never judge someone

15:44.270 --> 15:45.464
who's been so generous

15:45.510 --> 15:47.102
to your campaign.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.108
Yes.

15:49.140 --> 15:50.471
Yes, I will.

15:50.510 --> 15:53.240
I will keep you informed.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.578
Thank you.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.588
His Honor's_ all over me
on this one.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.485
Ballistics reports indicate

15:59.520 --> 16:02.250
both men were killed
with the same .380 handgun.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.121
Webster puts time of death

16:04.160 --> 16:06.048
at the school
between 5:00 and 5:30.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.092
Big school like that,
students and teachers

16:08.130 --> 16:10.496
are still roaming
the hallways, right?
Mm-hmm.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.395
We have
security VIdeo.

16:12.430 --> 16:16.036
Whoever walked into Doc's
office at that time

16:16.070 --> 16:18.106
is probably
our killer.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.074
Hey, guys, we got
a closed door mystery.

16:20.110 --> 16:23.102
The hall camera recorded back
to two hours before the murder.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.539
No one walked
into Doc Reid's room.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.378
You got any good news?
I do, but there's some more bad.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.047
Which do you want first?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.182
Never do the good
first, please.

16:31.220 --> 16:34.053
Well, the rest of the bad news

16:34.090 --> 16:37.548
is that Doc Reid's hard drive...

16:37.590 --> 16:39.023
completely destroyed.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.550
So the good news is that

16:40.600 --> 16:42.693
you miraculously recovered
all the information?

16:42.730 --> 16:45.062
Not that good. Let's call it
encouraging, though.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.192
So, computer peripherals,

16:46.230 --> 16:47.458
like the keyboard and mouse,

16:47.500 --> 16:48.728
they have their own
data storage.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.135
If the killer used the computer

16:50.170 --> 16:51.398
before he smashed it,

16:51.440 --> 16:52.464
I might be
able to locate

16:52.510 --> 16:53.477
a record of what he was doing

16:53.510 --> 16:54.738
or what he erased.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.202
You know, the killer sure knows

16:56.240 --> 16:57.707
a hell of a lot
about his victims.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.638
He knew exactly where
Cosgrove was going to be

16:59.680 --> 17:01.511
during the scavenger hunt,
and somehow,

17:01.550 --> 17:03.040
he was lying in wait

17:03.090 --> 17:04.148
in Doc Reid's office?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.339
JAY:
And no one noticed him go in?

17:05.390 --> 17:07.187
Or he was noticed,

17:07.220 --> 17:09.313
but it wasn't unusual,
because he works there.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.658
Where is Robert Chavez
right now?

17:11.690 --> 17:13.692
AL:
Jay says the Mets game
ended early enough

17:13.730 --> 17:15.197
for Chavez to
leave the hotel

17:15.230 --> 17:16.822
and make it downtown
to kill Cosgrove.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.499
Okay, let's say
he did kill Cosgrove.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.794
We still don't know
if he killed Doc.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.831
Or how he got in his office

17:23.870 --> 17:25.337
without those security cameras
seeing him.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.838
I'm gonna go check it out, okay?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.075
I'm gonna talk
to Chavez.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.725
*

18:50.190 --> 18:51.657
You think
I killed Doc?

18:51.690 --> 18:53.351
Timeline fits.
You could have killed him

18:53.400 --> 18:55.288
and made it back for
Cosgrove's memorial.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.423
Wait a minute.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.926
Isn't it part of your job
to establish a motive?

18:58.970 --> 19:00.938
He wrote Marshall,
your best friend

19:00.970 --> 19:03.359
and benefactor's son,
a bad recommendation.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.469
Yeah, sure, I was surprised
Doc did that.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.863
Maybe angry?
Yeah, I was angry.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.468
But I wouldn't
kill Doc for that.

19:08.510 --> 19:09.738
Why didn't you just go and write

19:09.780 --> 19:11.372
a glowing recommendation
yourself?

19:11.410 --> 19:12.399
Hey, believe me, I offered to,

19:12.450 --> 19:13.872
but Jeb refused to let me.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.319
He thought that it was
an unfair advantage.

19:15.350 --> 19:16.772
It was... it was
a conflict of interest.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.380
He and his money really pulled
the choke collar, huh?

19:19.420 --> 19:21.183
Must've been frustrating.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.552
Oh, my God. Hold on, Al.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.729
You also think that
I murdered my best friend?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.398
Camille.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.227
You were sick of sharing her.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.794
Wow, I get it.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.263
You're judging me.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.234
I'm gonna look deep
into your life.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.931
I find out you
own a handgun,

19:36.970 --> 19:38.267
you're going away.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.278
You know what?
Please, dig into it.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.278
and I'm a member _of four
anti-handgun organizations.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.403
Now, if you'll
excuse me, Al,

19:46.450 --> 19:49.317
we have grief counselors to hire
and parents to reassure.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.489
It's "Lieutenant Burns."

19:51.520 --> 19:54.318
I've had it with the "first name
and handshakes," all right?

19:59.660 --> 20:01.594
Hey.
Figure out
the mystery?

20:01.630 --> 20:03.291
I'm working on it.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.298
How about
Chavez?
Working on it.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.865
AL:
So, Mr. Powels...
Cameron, please.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.502
First names and
handshakes here.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.235
Al...

20:16.280 --> 20:17.645
I've seen
that girl before.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.307
She was working

20:19.350 --> 20:22.012
at Cosgrove's office
and she goes to this school,

20:22.050 --> 20:24.484
which means she has a connection
to both victims.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.748
Excuse me...

20:26.690 --> 20:27.657
Hey...

20:27.690 --> 20:29.419
Hey! Hey!

20:30.060 --> 20:32.255
I'll cut her off!

20:33.600 --> 20:35.329
CARRIE:
Hey!

20:35.360 --> 20:36.395
M-Move!

20:45.510 --> 20:46.966
Hey! You!

20:47.010 --> 20:48.307
Did you see a girl

20:48.340 --> 20:50.547
come around
that corner?
No one else

20:50.580 --> 20:52.502
is in here
but me and you.
I'm going to
ask you again.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.677
Did you see
a pretty girl,

20:54.720 --> 20:56.676
hair braided to the side,

20:56.720 --> 20:58.915
black-rimmed glasses,
come around that corner?

20:58.950 --> 21:00.588
_ I think the more _
Important question is

21:00.620 --> 21:02.656
who is the pretty lady
standing in front of me?

21:05.030 --> 21:07.396
if you don't
answer my question-- now.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.489
Uh, it sounds
like Kendell Wilson,

21:09.530 --> 21:10.929
but I didn't...
I didn't see her.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.369
You didn't see her?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.594
All right.
Where'd she go?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.892
You didn't see her?
AL:
No.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.305
Okay.

21:17.340 --> 21:18.898
It's like she just...
disappeared.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.373
She was...

21:34.620 --> 21:36.451
Wait a second.

21:36.490 --> 21:37.923
Al, earlier,

21:37.960 --> 21:39.951
a girl passed me
in the hallway, right?

21:39.990 --> 21:41.628
And then a minute later,
she reappeared

21:41.660 --> 21:42.854
from the opposite
direction

21:42.900 --> 21:44.322
without ever _
passmg me by again.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.598
Maybe she took a
different entrance.

21:45.630 --> 21:46.824
There are no
other entrances.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.599
And it's not like
this is Hogwarts.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.108
They're not walking around
wearing cloaks of invisibility.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.767
Somehow, these kids

21:52.810 --> 21:55.608
are passing through
this school undetected.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.505
If you're right,
that's how Doc's killer

21:57.550 --> 21:59.006
got in without
being seen.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.608
We have to check and see

22:00.650 --> 22:02.675
if Kendell Wilson is
the girl from Cosgrove's.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.086
I'm gonna try to figure out
how these students

22:05.120 --> 22:06.712
are just disappearing
into the walls.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.559
I'll track down
Kendell Wilson.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.467
Check this out--
Doc Reid got his PhD from MIT,

22:19.500 --> 22:21.388
and he happens
to be on the board.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.532
that wrote the S.A.T.'s.

22:22.570 --> 22:24.936
According to school records,
he only made $70,000 a year.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.705
Maybe enough that he sold
S.A.T. answer keys.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.004
Well, if he did, he's doing it
wrong, 'cause I can't find

22:31.050 --> 22:32.870
a penny more than his salary
in his financials.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.616
How does Kendell Wilson fit?

22:34.650 --> 22:36.447
Well, she scored
perfect S.A.T.'s.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.141
And get this--

22:38.190 --> 22:39.714
she's not an intern.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.615
At 16 years old, she's
a part-time employee

22:41.660 --> 22:44.458
at Cosgrove Strategies, and she
makes more than enough money

22:44.490 --> 22:47.129
to pay for her own schooling
at over $50,000 a year.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.855
I don't get it.
Cosgrove paid her

22:48.900 --> 22:50.390
a bunch of money
to work part-time,

22:50.430 --> 22:52.569
and she ends up with
perfect scores from Doc?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.739
Could've aced the S.A.T.'s.
It's possible.

22:54.770 --> 22:56.931
Okay, so the connection
between Cosgrove's murder

22:56.970 --> 22:58.164
and Doc is...?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.531
Kendell Wilson.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.979
Who has the keys to this closet?

23:02.010 --> 23:04.399
Uh, the janitors,
the principal and me.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.702
Any of the the students?

23:06.750 --> 23:09.514
Uh, no.
You sure about that?

23:09.550 --> 23:11.541
No.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.468
Clear.

23:32.610 --> 23:33.907
Maintenance tunnels.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.578
They run all over
the school.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.475
I need you to take me
to the storage closet

23:37.510 --> 23:39.444
in Doc Reid's office.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.119
CARRIE:
Let's go.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.199
You want me
to go down there With you?

23:59.230 --> 24:01.460
No, I'm good. Thanks.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.807
Oh, remember me?

24:06.840 --> 24:07.932
I'm one of the cops

24:07.980 --> 24:09.208
you ran from
at school today.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.468
Excuse me, Officer.

24:10.510 --> 24:12.569
Don't you need
a warrant or something

24:12.610 --> 24:13.645
to question a minor?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.511
It's Lieutenant. And no.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.848
It's okay, Aunt Vicki.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.859
I didn't know leaving a public
place was against the law.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.482
VICKI: Kendell,
watch your tone.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.782
I am watching my tone.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.685
I'm going for
sarcastic indifference.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.856
Boy, you're a luclq one, huh?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.219
On most days.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.989
Is Kendell in trouble?

24:31.030 --> 24:32.224
JAY: No, no one's
in trouble, miss.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.635
We just, uh, want to talk.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.831
You're at Cosgrove Strategies?

24:35.870 --> 24:38.168
She's an intern there.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.837
"An intern"

24:39.870 --> 24:41.576
Mr. Cosgrove personally
recruited her.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.704
Found out what a talented
computer programmer she is.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.570
Did he?

24:46.610 --> 24:49.170
I was under the impression
you were an employee.

24:49.220 --> 24:52.087
_ No. No. _
Just-just-just an intern.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.788
Kendell, would you like
to discuss this in private?

24:57.830 --> 25:00.890
Yeah. Yeah, actually that would,
that be great.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.591
Kendell, are you sure?
Your mom and dad

25:02.630 --> 25:03.767
would want me to be with you.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.665
No. No. I-I think it's okay.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.260
She'll be all right.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.719
Excuse me?

25:26.590 --> 25:27.659
Hey!

25:30.120 --> 25:31.519
Stop!

25:32.790 --> 25:34.951
Police!

25:40.030 --> 25:41.668
Oh, come on, don't bust me!

25:41.700 --> 25:43.031
It was just a cigarette!
You can check!

25:43.070 --> 25:44.708
I'm not interested in
busting you for Cigarettes.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.264
Who knows about these tunnels?

25:46.310 --> 25:48.198
Most students, uh, seniors.
You again?

25:48.240 --> 25:51.300
Really? Have you ever seen
any teachers down here?

25:51.350 --> 25:53.045
Are you kidding me?
I only come down here

25:53.080 --> 25:55.116
because they never would,
all right? You skinned my knee.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.118
Oh, don't be such
a baby, Wyatt Stromer,

25:57.150 --> 25:59.345
441 Sutton Place,
apartment 103.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.017
I know where you live.
Yeah, you, uh,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.585
you want to give me a lift home?
My mom's making quinoa.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.358
Maybe she can make you... No?
No.

26:04.390 --> 26:05.880
So, no to dinner?

26:05.930 --> 26:07.921
No to dinner.
Okay.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.191
Go home to your mommy.
This is a crime scene.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.118
So, you're one
of Cosgrove's employees?

26:13.170 --> 26:15.058
Uh, just after-school work.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.192
Whoa, wait a minute, wait.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.605
Cosgrove paid you enough money

26:17.640 --> 26:19.062
to cover your tuition

26:19.110 --> 26:21.237
for just after

26:22.740 --> 26:24.776
So, why are you hiding it
from your aunt?

26:25.850 --> 26:27.647
Kendell,

26:27.680 --> 26:29.113
you're 16.

26:29.150 --> 26:30.708
Even if you loved him...

26:30.750 --> 26:32.945
Oh, God! No, no, no!
Uh, no.

26:32.990 --> 26:36.380
S-Sorry, it's just...
he wasn't like that at all.

26:36.420 --> 26:39.924
He was... r-really cool
and-and respectful.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.393
You need to tell me the truth
about what's gomg on.

26:41.430 --> 26:42.829
Two people are dead.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.624
You're connected
to both of them.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.730
I hacked Mr. Cosgrove's servers

26:48.770 --> 26:51.409
to prove that he needed
a security update.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.738
So you prove you can hack
into Cosgrove's company,

26:53.780 --> 26:55.008
so that he gives you a job?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.405
Exactly.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.807
That's classic white hat
strategy, Kendell.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.148
Problem is you got
to wear a black hat

27:02.180 --> 27:03.886
before you can put on
the white hat...

27:03.920 --> 27:05.410
Hey. What'd you find out?

27:05.450 --> 27:07.782
I knew there was an answer
to this riddle. Listen:

27:07.820 --> 27:09.788
There are steam tunnels running
directly underneath the school.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.923
One of them leads

27:10.960 --> 27:12.257
right into a storage closet

27:12.290 --> 27:13.996
in Doc Reid's office.

27:14.030 --> 27:15.952
So the killer could've used
the tunnels to get

27:16.000 --> 27:17.991
in and out of Reid's_ office
completely unnoticed.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.429
As far as I can tell,
it's mostly used

27:19.470 --> 27:21.267
by students, you know,
trying to hide stuff

27:21.300 --> 27:22.699
they don't want
the faculty to see.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.230
You think a student killed Reid?

27:24.270 --> 27:25.737
CSU's are processing it now.

27:25.770 --> 27:26.839
I'll let you know
what they find.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.076
I'm talking to someone right now

27:28.110 --> 27:29.077
who might be able
to connect the dots.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.077
I'll get back to you.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.771
Okay. Bye.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.713
Kendell?

27:34.750 --> 27:36.411
I need you to come with us.

27:36.450 --> 27:37.917
Come on.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.339
KENDELL:
You seriously think

27:40.390 --> 27:41.709
I could've killed someone?!

27:41.760 --> 27:42.715
I'm going to be sick.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.954
Not in the car.

27:43.990 --> 27:45.753
But you have
to believe me, okay?

27:45.790 --> 27:47.018
All I did was hack
some people's computers.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.197
"People's"?

27:48.230 --> 27:49.720
You hacked more than Cosgrove?

27:49.760 --> 27:52.263
Uh... eh, Mr. Cosgrove asked me

27:52.300 --> 27:54.439
to hack Doc Reid's computer.

27:54.470 --> 27:56.893
He said he did something wrong
at school.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.168
You worked for Cosgrove,

27:58.210 --> 27:59.359
you hacked into
Doc Reid's computer.

27:59.410 --> 28:02.208
You know how to disappear
in those tunnels at the school.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.571
You know about those?
We know about everything!

28:03.610 --> 28:06.704
So you better start
telling us the truth.
I am, I swear, okay?

28:06.750 --> 28:09.116
Why would I kill Mr. Cosgrove?

28:09.150 --> 28:10.811
He was paying
for my education, okay?

28:10.850 --> 28:12.841
I would be ruining
my whole life.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.949
Why did Cosgrove ask you
to hack in the first place?

28:14.990 --> 28:16.150
Was it because of
the bad recommendation

28:16.190 --> 28:18.385
the doc gave Marshall?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.125
He said that Doc Reid
was cheating,

28:20.160 --> 28:21.991
but he wanted solid proof

28:22.030 --> 28:24.863
that he was selling
S.A.T. answers before

28:24.900 --> 28:25.719
he confronted him--

28:25.770 --> 28:27.738
he didn't want
to falsely accuse Doc.

28:27.770 --> 28:29.988
Where were you the night
of the scavenger hunt?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.803
Working at the office.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.831
I'm sure_I'm
on the security tape.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.905
Wouldn't put it past a hacker
like you to doctor the footage.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.873
Hey. How could I get a text
from Mr. Cosgrove?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.512
Oh, my God.
Hand it over.

28:42.550 --> 28:45.189
Oh, my God-- Aunt Vicki...
Get the phone,
get the phone.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.312
What does it say?

28:46.350 --> 28:47.783
JAY:
"Give me everything you stole

28:47.820 --> 28:49.356
"from Doc's computer.

28:49.390 --> 28:50.482
"I have your aunt.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.851
Trade."

28:51.890 --> 28:53.027
Oh, my God-- Aunt Vicki.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.391
"McCarren Park, two hours.

28:54.430 --> 28:55.852
No cops."

29:01.040 --> 29:03.099
McCarren Park, two hours.
I'll try to track down
Cosgrove's phone.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.801
Oh, my God-- Aunt Vicki.
What are we gonna do?

29:04.840 --> 29:05.966
Let's get our undercover people
into place

29:06.010 --> 29:08.774
in McCarren Park.
If the kidnapper's good,

29:08.810 --> 29:11.005
they'll probably give Kendell
a second location when she

29:11.050 --> 29:13.974
gets to the park. They're gonna
want to make sure she's alone.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.818
What did you take
from Doc's computer?

29:16.850 --> 29:17.839
Financial spreadsheets,

29:17.890 --> 29:19.482
account numbers, no names.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.159
And then you sent that
to Cosgrove?

29:22.190 --> 29:24.829
Kind of. I mean, the dude's
really bad with tech--

29:24.860 --> 29:27.488
an old guy, you know?--
so, uh, he likes to have

29:27.530 --> 29:30.226
a hard copy, and I gave it
to him on the day that he died.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.967
Oh, my God, oh, my God, is it
my fault that he got killed,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.797
because I gave him
those files on the clay...

29:34.840 --> 29:36.137
You texted Cosgrove.

29:36.170 --> 29:37.330
That's how the kidnappers know

29:37.370 --> 29:38.928
you have a digital copy.

29:38.970 --> 29:40.870
So, we just give them
my flash drive,

29:40.910 --> 29:42.332
_ and then this
is all over, right?

29:42.380 --> 29:44.871
No, that would put your
aunt in worse danger.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.174
Whoever has her
doesn't want to trade.

29:47.210 --> 29:48.518
Then why did they take her?

29:48.550 --> 29:50.142
They want your copy of the file.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.841
But also they want you.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.518
You looked at the spreadsheets,
that makes you a witness.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.959
They've already killed
two witnesses.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.288
But my aunt saw
the kidnappers' faces!

29:58.330 --> 30:00.025
They could kill her!
Oh, my God, they're gonna...
She's gonna be okay.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.197
She's gonna be okay.
Listen to me.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.857
They need her safe and sound

30:02.900 --> 30:04.367
till they get you.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.958
And they're not getting you.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.467
Can't track the phone.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.889
They put the SIM card in a
burner cell that's untraceable.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.100
All right, so we do it
the hard way.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.960
You give me the flash drive

30:13.010 --> 30:14.534
and we'll use it
as a bargaining chip.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.036
I don't have it.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.947
Kendell, an hour and 58 minutes.
Where is it?!

30:18.980 --> 30:20.208
It's in my locker at school.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.571
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.581
Al, I'm telling you there's
no flash drive here.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.019
Check again.
We need the flash drive

30:30.060 --> 30:31.527
to save Kendell's aunt.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.490
Wait a second...

30:38.530 --> 30:40.589
Marshall? Hey.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.097
I'm Carrie Wells.
I'm here to help

30:42.140 --> 30:43.937
figure out what happened
to your dad.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.165
I know where the flash drive is.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.178
I'm heading
to Marshall Cosgrove's.

30:48.210 --> 30:48.972
Wait. Why Marshall?

30:49.010 --> 30:51.205
(hangs up,
then busy signal beeps)

30:55.120 --> 30:56.519
I didn't know he had it.
You could've at least

30:56.550 --> 30:58.415
mentioned he was a possibility.

30:58.450 --> 31:00.042
So, what

31:00.090 --> 31:01.318
No, I mean,
we're not even dating.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.920
He likes to keep it a secret.
I'm, like,

31:03.960 --> 31:05.382
his side slice or whatever.
It's not a big deal.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.488
"Side slice"?

31:06.530 --> 31:07.519
Really?

31:07.560 --> 31:09.323
Oh, boy.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.191
Look, when this is all done,
we're gonna have

31:11.230 --> 31:13.095
a talk about how you need
to be treated.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.166
Like you even know
anything about it.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.031
Oh, I know, I know.
I was 16 once.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.958
Yeah, a long time ago.
Hey, easy with that.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.068
Okay, you're not my dad.

31:20.110 --> 31:21.475
I am not your dad.
You're right.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.372
Why does Marshall have
the flash drive?

31:25.410 --> 31:27.571
I help him
with his homework sometimes.

31:27.610 --> 31:29.271
Ah, you do

31:29.320 --> 31:31.447
his homework.
You put it on the flash drive.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.219
He takes it from your locker.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.387
You help him cheat.

31:34.420 --> 31:37.457
Sometimes.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.188
We got four teams in place

31:40.230 --> 31:41.993
around McCarren Park.

31:42.030 --> 31:42.951
And two undercover spotters.

31:43.000 --> 31:43.967
Any sign of the victim?

31:45.130 --> 31:46.290
But A! is probably right.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.934
This is just the
initial location.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.063
Kendell arrives,
the kidnappers give her

31:50.100 --> 31:52.432
a second, more secure location
to meet for the exchange.

31:52.470 --> 31:55.200
Or kill them both.
Yeah.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.003
Why doesn't Kendell live
with her parents?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.041
Are

31:58.080 --> 31:59.240
No.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.577
They're in Buffalo.

32:00.610 --> 32:02.043
It's a blue collar couple.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.548
Nurse and bookkeeper
sacrificed everything

32:04.590 --> 32:06.319
to send Kendell
down here so she could

32:06.350 --> 32:07.578
get the best education.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.508
Ah, I feel for them.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.983
They try to do their best
they can for their daughter,

32:12.030 --> 32:15.397
and she ends up over
her head at 37th Prep.

32:15.430 --> 32:18.228
Don't tell me you have
a compassionate side, Eliot.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.091
I understand what she's
going through, that's all.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.129
You do?

32:22.170 --> 32:23.262
Yeah.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.131
I was once the scholarship kid

32:25.170 --> 32:26.637
at the fancy private school.

32:26.670 --> 32:27.978
Come on.
What?

32:28.010 --> 32:29.637
You don't see it?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.978
No. It's just, it's not...

32:32.010 --> 32:34.012
I mean, Eliot Delson.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.472
"Delson," uh, was the name

32:37.520 --> 32:40.614
of a landlord in
Southwest Ireland.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.754
My great-grandfather borrowed it

32:42.790 --> 32:46.123
along with some silverware
when he fled to America.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.582
Uh...

32:47.630 --> 32:49.359
my dad runs a diner

32:49.400 --> 32:52.119
on Sunrise Highway,
out in Suffolk.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.094
My mom is an eighth-grade
English teacher.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.358
I did not know that.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.504
Neither did my prep school
friends, until they did,

32:59.540 --> 33:01.098
and then they weren't
my friends anymore.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.028
So, yeah. Compassion.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.202
We did not share this moment.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.119
CARRIE:
Marshall!

33:11.150 --> 33:12.185
What are you
doing here?

33:12.220 --> 33:13.642
I need Kendell's flash drive.

33:13.690 --> 33:16.011
Kendell?
Marshall, you told me

33:16.060 --> 33:16.981
you weren't hanging out
with her.
I'm sorry,

33:17.020 --> 33:19.523
I'm sorry, what's your name?
Lacey Chambers.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.788
Shut up, Lacey.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.127
For one minute.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.195
I need the flash drive

33:23.230 --> 33:24.458
and I need it now.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.728
Now!
I...

33:29.170 --> 33:30.762
All right.
You'll be safe with her.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.108
Please save my Aunt Vicki.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.061
That's what
we're gonna do.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.179
Thanks.

33:34.210 --> 33:35.472
JAY:
Hey, Al.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.807
Here's what's on
the flash drive.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.070
Offshore bank account
belonging to Doc Reid.

33:39.110 --> 33:41.510
A private school teacher
with an offshore account?
Exactly.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.768
I thought it was a big deal
when my history teacher,

33:43.820 --> 33:45.617
Mr. Cignarella,
bought a used Camaro.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.481
Bet he didn't have
the S.A.T. answer keys, though.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.714
Wait a second.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.387
A million dollar deposit?

33:50.420 --> 33:51.785
Does seem like a lot,

33:51.830 --> 33:53.149
even for perfect
S.A.T. scores, right?

33:53.190 --> 33:54.452
But it's not enough
to buy scores.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.797
You gotta
open up a spot.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.229
Doc's bad recommendation

33:57.260 --> 33:59.228
knocked Marshall out.
Wait a second.

33:59.270 --> 34:00.168
So a single bad recommendation

34:00.200 --> 34:01.235
can get a kid knocked out?

34:01.270 --> 34:03.295
A single bad anything,
for a place like Harvard.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.568
But wait a second.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.168
How did Cosgrove
and Marshall

34:06.210 --> 34:07.609
even find out what
Reid said about him?

34:07.640 --> 34:09.176
That's stuff's private.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.632
No, by law,
you can't restrict that info

34:10.680 --> 34:12.102
from students and parents.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.242
All right. We find out

34:13.280 --> 34:14.474
who made the
million-dollar deposit,

34:14.520 --> 34:16.374
we find out who killed
Cosgrove and Doc Reid.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.217
Well, it's just
a numbered account

34:18.250 --> 34:20.241
from some shell corporation.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.784
Oshanski Industries, LLC.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.183
Oshanski?

34:30.230 --> 34:31.424
JOHN:
To Jeb!

34:32.500 --> 34:33.626
CARRIE: O-Ski.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.399
Jay, can you get images

34:35.440 --> 34:36.566
of all the seniors

34:36.600 --> 34:38.500
who got into Iw League schools?

34:45.650 --> 34:47.140
That one. Right there.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.281
Derrick Hibbert,
middle initial "0."

34:51.320 --> 34:52.844
He was at the
memorial serwce.

34:52.890 --> 34:54.357
And how much do you
want to bet that

34:54.390 --> 34:56.312
that "0" stands for Oshanski?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.157
AL: Jay, check
the gun registry.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.296
JAY:
There's a handgun,

35:01.330 --> 35:02.354
a Walther .380

35:02.400 --> 35:03.697
registered to a John Hibbert.

35:05.730 --> 35:08.369
And he never once called me
"Mr. Hibbert."

35:08.400 --> 35:09.662
I was always "John."

35:09.700 --> 35:11.702
John Hibbert.

35:11.740 --> 35:14.174
He was also _
at Cosgrove's memorial.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.305
JAY:
And he happens to be

35:19.350 --> 35:20.601
Derrick's father,
and he also graduated

35:20.650 --> 35:22.277
from 37th Prep.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.571
Then he knows about the tunnels.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.214
Jay...
I'll get you your warrant.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.285
Police!

35:27.320 --> 35:29.550
Vicki Wilson!

35:31.490 --> 35:33.583
What the hell is going on?
Get your hands off of me.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.257
CARRIE:
Where is she?
Where's who?

35:35.300 --> 35:36.392
Where is she?
OFFICER:
All clear!

35:36.430 --> 35:38.261
No sign of the hostage.
AL:
Where's Vicki Wilson?

35:38.300 --> 35:40.222
Who's Vicki Wilson?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.430
JOHN:
What is going on?

35:41.470 --> 35:44.200
Well, if she's not
here, where is she?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.206
You put a million dollars
into Doc Reid's account,

35:53.250 --> 35:54.547
bribing him to get
your son, Derrick,

35:54.580 --> 35:55.945
into an Iw League school.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.516
Cosgrove found out,

35:57.550 --> 35:59.484
he confronted you
and you killed him.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.782
I didn't shoot Jeb.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.617
This says you did,
and with this gun.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.355
Then you killed
Doc Reid,

36:04.390 --> 36:06.551
because he could tie you
to the Cosgrove murder.

36:06.590 --> 36:09.798
JOHN: If there were
more Jeb Cosgroves,

36:09.830 --> 36:11.866
the financial crisis
would never have happened.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.492
First names and handshakes.
To Jeb!

36:16.540 --> 36:17.564
ALL:
To Jeb.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.842
We've got it all wrong.

36:32.020 --> 36:33.248
Don't we?

36:34.620 --> 36:37.714
Derrick did all of this,
not you.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.385
He tracked

36:38.430 --> 36:39.829
Cosgrove down
the night

36:39.860 --> 36:41.259
of the scavenger hunt

36:41.300 --> 36:42.528
and he killed him

36:42.560 --> 36:44.221
to save you from
a bribery scandal.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.362
And then he
killed Doc

36:45.400 --> 36:46.594
to cover his tracks.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.291
He told you what
he'd done to Cosgrove

36:48.340 --> 36:49.693
the night of the memorial,
didn't he?

36:49.740 --> 36:51.708
Now he's got Vicki Wilson
in his crosshairs,

36:51.740 --> 36:53.708
and we've got 17 minutes
to find her.

36:53.740 --> 36:54.900
CARRIE:
You need to hear me.

36:54.940 --> 36:58.000
This is a hostage situation
with a murderer.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.644
The cops will do

36:59.680 --> 37:01.739
whatever it takes
to save that hostage,

37:01.780 --> 37:04.613
which means using deadly force
on your son.

37:04.650 --> 37:05.582
Shoot first.

37:05.620 --> 37:06.587
That's the order.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.689
CARRIE:
It's your turn

37:07.720 --> 37:09.358
to protect him, John.
Talk to me.

37:12.290 --> 37:13.621
He took my gun.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.924
He used it.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.597
Where is he?

37:18.630 --> 37:19.892
I don't know.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.763
I've been looking for him,
waiting for him to call.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.439
Promise me you'll help Derrick.

37:26.470 --> 37:27.698
Please.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.298
We'll do our best.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.684
You know what to say.

37:50.500 --> 37:51.694
It's okay. Answer it.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.664
Aunt Vicki?

37:54.700 --> 37:55.894
VICKI:
I am fine.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.430
Where

37:57.470 --> 37:59.631
Kendell, are you
at McCarren Park?

38:00.840 --> 38:02.876
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.502
You need to take
a selfie to prove it.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.274
Uh, okay. Hold on.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.674
We cloned your
phone earlier.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.780
Thanks to your photo library,
the cloud

38:13.820 --> 38:15.754
and Google Images,
we've got this.

38:15.790 --> 38:16.916
Ready?
Yeah.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.785
Okay. Uh...
Should I text it to you now?

38:20.830 --> 38:21.819
VICKI:
Yes.

38:27.530 --> 38:30.328
Now...
go to the alley

38:30.370 --> 38:33.032
behind the East River Ferry
with the flash drive.

38:33.070 --> 38:34.799
Alone.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.434
Text another picture
when you get there.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.698
Aunt Vicki

38:39.750 --> 38:41.718
VICKI:
Ken...

38:41.750 --> 38:44.583
Kendell, don't...!

38:44.620 --> 38:45.882
You guys, you get all that?

38:45.920 --> 38:48.957
Carrie's already looking
at a map of the area.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.981
We'll call you back
as soon as we know.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.821
Kayak rentals.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.560
JOHN: First names
and handshakes.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.965
To Jeb!

39:02.000 --> 39:03.433
ALL:
To Jeb!

39:05.710 --> 39:06.961
Derrick's on the crew team.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.375
Right?

39:08.410 --> 39:10.605
What are these buildings
along the shore?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.115
We're here
to see Dr. Reid.

39:15.150 --> 39:16.708
You on the list?

39:16.750 --> 39:18.513
CARRIE: How about you make
an exception for us?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.651
Robinson Boathouse.

39:21.690 --> 39:22.782
That's where the 37th Prep

39:22.820 --> 39:25.857
crew t_eam store
their shells.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.031
KENDELL:
He's really good.

39:40.070 --> 39:41.970
Him?
He's the best.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.830
Don't tell him-- or anyone--
that I said that.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.869
Cross my heart.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.153
CARRIE: Derrick,
drop the gun, right now!

40:02.200 --> 40:04.794
I told your father
you wouldn't die today.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.724
If you don't drop that gun,

40:07.770 --> 40:09.397
there's on one way
this ends, okay?

40:11.100 --> 40:12.465
None of you understand!

40:12.510 --> 40:14.933
My great-grandfather,

40:14.980 --> 40:17.574
grandfather, father...

40:17.610 --> 40:19.908
all went to Ivys.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.838
And I'm supposed
to go to an Ivy, too.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.747
I can't let
my dad down.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.644
Put the gun down, Derrick.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.918
Your father loves you.

40:27.950 --> 40:28.985
He wants you to live.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.152
It's over, Derrick.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.944
Oh, Aunt Vicki...
you're okay.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.446
I'm all right, Kendell.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.498
Do you need anything else
from me, Detective Burns?

41:08.530 --> 41:09.997
Nope.
You've given your report.

41:10.030 --> 41:11.054
You're free to go.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.237
I... I really don't
know how to thank you.

41:16.270 --> 41:18.192
Oh, that's the easy part.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.832
I mean... cure cancer.

41:19.870 --> 41:21.064
Go to Mars.

41:21.110 --> 41:22.873
Do great things
with your big brain.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.071
And stop with the side slice,
will you?

41:25.110 --> 41:26.839
Okay, "Dad," I get it.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.111
Ah, there's that sarcastic
indifference I love.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.698
Who are you thinking about?

41:45.730 --> 41:47.197
You really want to know?

41:47.230 --> 41:48.936
Yeah.
Okay.

41:48.970 --> 41:51.029
If we ever got married...
: Whoa...

41:51.070 --> 41:53.163
Okay, you know, settle down.
It's hypothetical.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.837
Okay, all right.
If we ever
got married,

41:54.880 --> 41:58.031
would you be into
an open marriage?

41:58.080 --> 41:58.944
No.
Aw...

41:58.980 --> 42:00.004
Absolutely not.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.177
Why do
you ask?
No reason.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.812
I know why, because you want...

42:03.850 --> 42:05.681
you want Mr. Secret Service guy
on the side.

42:05.720 --> 42:06.948
You're obsessed with him.

42:06.990 --> 42:07.979
No. You're the one talking

42:08.020 --> 42:09.282
about him wearing a Speedo.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.617
It was not a Speedo,

42:10.660 --> 42:11.684
and you're just jealous.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.480
No, I'm not jealous.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.986
I'm just a little
busier than he is.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.156
Thing is, he's...

42:15.200 --> 42:16.997
he's got time to go to the gym,

42:17.030 --> 42:18.019
that's good for him.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.322
I'm too busy,
all right?

42:19.370 --> 42:21.019
You look great
in a Speedo, too, Al.

42:21.070 --> 42:23.095
I've never had a Speedo on
in my life.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.630
August 23,

42:24.670 --> 42:26.934
1999, we were on
the beach that day.

42:26.970 --> 42:28.801
You came down in your
tiny little Speedo...

42:28.840 --> 42:31.274
It's called a James Bond
square cut, okay?

42:31.310 --> 42:33.574
Listen, you looked...

42:33.610 --> 42:34.872
very sew.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.217
I have it all right up here.

42:36.250 --> 42:38.718
You are buying
the drinks tonight.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.889
Remember that bikini I wore?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.979
It's right here.

42:44.790 --> 42:46.018
What color
was it?

42:46.060 --> 42:47.789
