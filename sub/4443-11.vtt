WEBVTT

00:01.647 --> 00:04.081
Callie, this is Lena. Lena, Callie.

00:04.182 --> 00:06.283
It's just for a few weeks, right?

00:06.385 --> 00:08.052
She's gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

00:08.153 --> 00:10.287
- How are you, honey?
- I'm good, how are you?

00:10.389 --> 00:13.090
- Hi babies!
- What? Nobody told you our mom's a cop?

00:13.191 --> 00:15.092
- Whoa! Hey!
- [gasps]

00:15.193 --> 00:16.126
- What the hell are you doing?
- I just want to talk...

00:16.228 --> 00:19.162
[Brandon] Calm down, man! Ok, ok, ok.

00:19.263 --> 00:23.166
Police, freeze! Freeze!
Get down on your knees now!

00:23.267 --> 00:25.368
[Stef] We are not sending these
kids back into that system.

00:25.469 --> 00:27.671
- You selling my pills?
- I've been talking to Ana.

00:27.772 --> 00:31.608
- [Jesus] Our birth mom?
- Here.

00:31.709 --> 00:34.911
I don't want you dating Wyatt because
I don't want you dating anyone.

00:35.012 --> 00:38.080
Even having this conversation
can get me and Jude kicked out.

00:38.181 --> 00:40.449
- [Callie] That was Liam.
- The foster brother you told me about?

00:40.551 --> 00:41.912
He forced me to have sex with him.

00:42.853 --> 00:44.253
[Mike] 11-99! Officer down!

00:44.354 --> 00:46.022
Will you marry me?

00:46.122 --> 00:48.490
I thought you'd never ask.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.859
- You mean, like, adopt us?
- Is that a yes?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.761
- Yeah.
- Yes!

00:52.862 --> 00:55.129
You deserve to be happy, don't you?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.903
[Stewart] I'm very proud to welcome you

01:02.004 --> 01:04.539
to the marriage of Lena Elizabeth Adams

01:04.638 --> 01:07.575
to Stefanie Marie Foster.

01:07.676 --> 01:11.378
She's gonna be devastated when she
finds out we aren't coming back.

01:11.479 --> 01:14.048
I'm not going to be selfish
anymore, ok? I promise.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.828
- What are you doing here?
- I need a ride.

01:35.836 --> 01:36.469
[both chuckle]

01:38.270 --> 01:40.305
Good morning, Mrs. Adams Foster.

01:40.406 --> 01:42.841
Good morning, Mrs. Adams Foster.

01:42.942 --> 01:44.743
No hyphen, right? We agreed, yes?

01:44.844 --> 01:47.913
No hyphen.

01:48.014 --> 01:49.982
But how much do I love that we
all have the same last names now.

01:50.083 --> 01:53.150
Mm-hmm. I love it, I love it, I love it...

01:53.251 --> 01:55.519
Is that bacon?

01:55.621 --> 01:58.055
- [inhaling]
- Mmm.

01:58.156 --> 01:59.824
Your mom must be making breakfast.

01:59.925 --> 02:02.292
Oh, I love her in this moment
right now... I love her very much.

02:04.562 --> 02:06.497
Does that mean we have to join them?

02:06.598 --> 02:08.632
No. It's our honeymoon, it's our honeymoon.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.166
Do we have to? Please say no.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.570
The only thing you have to do...

02:14.672 --> 02:16.472
Yeah?

02:16.573 --> 02:18.975
Is kiss me.

02:19.076 --> 02:20.476
[groans] Morning breath,
that's not going to happen.

02:20.577 --> 02:22.378
- I don't care.
- [chuckles]

02:22.479 --> 02:24.614
- Come here, woman.
- [gasps]

02:24.714 --> 02:26.114
I love it when you call me "woman."

02:34.958 --> 02:39.461
Well, I thought that that was just the
most beautiful wedding that I'd ever seen.

02:39.562 --> 02:41.863
You know, Stef's dad and
I got married in Las Vegas,

02:41.964 --> 02:44.598
in one of those awful theme chapels.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.268
Good morning, darling. Sit down and eat.

02:47.369 --> 02:49.537
Wow, you've been busy, Grandma.

02:49.638 --> 02:52.239
Well, you know, they don't tell
you when you do a DIY wedding

02:52.340 --> 02:55.109
that you're gonna have
to un-DIY it yourself.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.878
I mean, look at all this stuff.

02:57.979 --> 03:00.260
- Where's Callie?
- She has guitar lessons Sunday morning.

03:02.550 --> 03:07.253
- Wow, Ma! Did you even sleep?
- Sleep is so over-rated.

03:07.354 --> 03:11.892
I wanted to make sure we got everything
done before I fly out tonight.

03:11.993 --> 03:14.560
You know, I don't want to
leave you with any of this.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.162
- Thank you.
- That is so sweet, Sharon, thank you.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.531
I'm loading up the
glasses and the dishes now,

03:19.632 --> 03:22.334
I already got the tables in the SUV.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.905
- You loaded the tables?
- Well, Jesus helped me.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.040
- You did? Good boy.
- That's great because the tables...

03:29.141 --> 03:31.541
That's all I'm doing. It's
Lexi's last day before she leaves,

03:31.610 --> 03:32.877
and I'm spending it with her.

03:32.978 --> 03:35.613
Um, no.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.075
Lexi's coming over and we're
working on our English project.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.451
And we're totally behind because
every time she comes over here,

03:40.552 --> 03:41.920
she ends up hanging out with you.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.755
But that's not due for like a month.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.989
Yeah, and Lexi's going
to be gone for awhile.

03:46.091 --> 03:47.490
We're not saving it until the last minute,

03:47.592 --> 03:49.292
we're supposed work on it all semester.

03:49.393 --> 03:51.628
- Where's she going?
- To Honduras to see family.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.296
Wait, how's that going to work?

03:53.397 --> 03:55.099
Her dad has a way, I guess.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.869
[Sharon] When is she supposed to be back?

03:58.970 --> 04:02.538
- Um, two weeks.
- The way you said it...

04:02.639 --> 04:05.007
I thought she was moving away forever.

04:05.109 --> 04:07.509
God, no. I think I'd die.

04:07.611 --> 04:10.012
Hey, Ma. Thank you so much
for everything you've done.

04:10.114 --> 04:13.750
I can't believe you loaded the tables
in the SUV because unfortunately...

04:13.851 --> 04:15.785
Hey! Why are all the tables in your SUV?

04:15.886 --> 04:16.752
I thought I was supposed to
pick them up to return them?

04:16.853 --> 04:19.353
I'm sorry, my fault.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.975
- It's fine, but the glasses and the dishes...
- And the chairs.

04:22.058 --> 04:24.659
And the chairs... they have
to go back after the glasses.

04:24.761 --> 04:26.201
[Lena] We could do the glasses first

04:26.229 --> 04:28.063
but it makes more sense geographically

04:28.164 --> 04:29.831
if we start with the chairs

04:29.932 --> 04:32.267
and work our way around the
loop ending with the glasses.

04:32.368 --> 04:35.403
A word of advice to the
newly married, we say yes.

04:35.504 --> 04:37.004
It's so much easier.

04:37.105 --> 04:39.507
You never do, so shut up.

04:39.608 --> 04:42.042
All right, well we got
tables to unload and reload...

04:42.144 --> 04:44.044
That means everybody. Let's go, let's go!

04:44.146 --> 04:48.483
- I just got dressed.
- Guys, I'm so sorry.

04:48.584 --> 04:51.851
- Mom, it's fine.
- I was just trying to help.

04:51.952 --> 04:54.621
Yes, and you were a very big
help and we appreciate it.

04:54.722 --> 04:58.525
Listen, I didn't want to say anything
yesterday 'cause the wedding and all,

04:58.626 --> 04:59.893
but...

05:02.963 --> 05:06.666
Adoption? Really?

05:06.767 --> 05:09.127
I mean, I think Jude and Callie
are great kids, I really do,

05:09.169 --> 05:11.236
but they've only been here a little while,

05:11.338 --> 05:14.307
you don't really know
what they have been through

05:14.408 --> 05:16.676
and you've got three other
kids you need to take care of.

05:16.777 --> 05:18.511
Have you thought this through?

05:18.612 --> 05:20.446
Yes, Mom.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.614
Yep.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.026
[engine starts]

05:38.230 --> 05:39.897
Wyatt...

05:39.998 --> 05:40.764
[brakes screech]

05:44.806 --> 05:47.047
I'm not letting you in until
you tell me what's going on.

05:47.072 --> 05:50.141
- Come on, Wyatt.
- No.

05:50.242 --> 05:52.543
I don't think I want to be harboring
a known fugitive unless I know why.

05:54.230 --> 05:55.647
Fine.

05:57.431 --> 05:58.460
Can I please get in?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.361
- I'm not moving.
- Things just weren't working out, ok?

06:15.031 --> 06:18.433
I was probably gonna get sent to
another foster home and I just...

06:18.534 --> 06:19.768
[sighs]

06:19.870 --> 06:23.538
I can't do it anymore.

06:23.639 --> 06:28.309
I want... I need to be in charge
of my own life for once, you know?

06:30.579 --> 06:33.348
What do you mean, things
weren't working out?

06:33.448 --> 06:37.218
- You seemed pretty happy.
- Yeah? Yeah.

06:37.319 --> 06:39.487
Sure, I was.

06:39.588 --> 06:41.922
It's just...

06:42.023 --> 06:44.691
Did you do something? Or something?

06:44.792 --> 06:46.360
Well, it's nothing illegal, no.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.862
No, no, I mean like, like something bad.

06:50.231 --> 06:51.965
Maybe.

07:18.590 --> 07:20.926
So, I didn't get to talk
to Callie last night,

07:23.862 --> 07:28.366
and I know that yesterday was kind of...

07:28.467 --> 07:31.402
weird, what happened and everything,

07:31.502 --> 07:34.371
and I just, you know,

07:34.472 --> 07:39.009
wanted to make sure you're cool.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.611
No, you don't.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.232
You just wanna know if I'm gonna tell.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.751
- What? No, that's...
- So, what?

07:48.852 --> 07:50.886
You think you're gonna
be with my sister now?

07:52.534 --> 07:56.386
You can't be together. They won't adopt us.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.161
Well, we...

08:03.262 --> 08:05.464
we'll figure something out, you know.

08:05.565 --> 08:08.200
We'll talk about it when she
gets back from her guitar lesson.

08:08.301 --> 08:09.968
You're no better than Liam.

08:10.069 --> 08:13.105
Hey! I'm not Liam.

08:13.206 --> 08:15.207
I'm nothing like Liam.

08:15.308 --> 08:17.175
I love Callie.

I know how it works.

Here's a little something. You'll
share that with your friend.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.096
Yeah. Ok, great. Thank you.

09:24.197 --> 09:28.267
You two can see yourselves out, can't you?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.568
[Jude] They're gonna kill you.

09:30.669 --> 09:33.471
They are not. Shh! Come
here and check this out.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.706
They're going to love
it and I know they are,

09:35.807 --> 09:39.810
because I love this bed so much...

09:39.911 --> 09:43.581
I love this bed like...

09:43.682 --> 09:45.982
like Sleeping Beauty loves her Prince.

09:46.084 --> 09:48.118
As a matter of fact,

09:48.219 --> 09:51.188
if Sleeping Beauty had had this bed,

09:51.289 --> 09:54.224
I don't think she would've even
wanted that prince to wake her up.

09:54.325 --> 09:56.759
[chuckles] Back home in
Tampa I have this boyfriend,

09:56.860 --> 10:01.130
and, well, he's kind of a nimrod,

10:01.231 --> 10:03.632
but I'm not gonna break
up with him, you know why?

10:03.733 --> 10:07.603
Because I love his bed.

10:07.704 --> 10:10.206
[laughing] Here, check it out.

10:10.307 --> 10:13.041
You can raise the feet up

10:13.143 --> 10:15.944
or you can raise the
head up if you wanna read.

10:16.045 --> 10:18.713
Yeah, there you go.
You're doing it. All right.

10:18.814 --> 10:21.149
Ok, whoa! Hey cowboy! Ahh!

10:21.250 --> 10:22.350
[both laughing]

10:22.451 --> 10:23.451
- Give me that.
- Whoops.

10:23.552 --> 10:25.052
Jack your own side up there, buddy.

10:25.154 --> 10:27.122
That's better. Yeah.

10:27.223 --> 10:30.225
[sighs]

10:30.326 --> 10:33.427
Wouldn't it be better to get rid of
the nimrod and buy yourself a bed?

10:33.528 --> 10:37.864
You don't pull any punches, do you?

10:37.965 --> 10:39.833
You're just like my daughter.

10:42.103 --> 10:45.172
Ok, here we go. There he goes.

10:45.273 --> 10:47.641
Look, I'm a taco.

10:47.742 --> 10:52.411
[laughs] Look, I'm a corpse.

10:55.115 --> 10:57.250
Can I have some time
with my girlfriend now?

10:57.351 --> 10:58.684
No, we have to get this done, Jesus.

10:58.785 --> 11:00.786
- Leave us alone.
- Can't you take a break?

11:00.887 --> 11:02.655
What part of no don't you understand?

11:04.158 --> 11:06.258
Lexi, come on.

11:06.359 --> 11:09.861
Um, I can use a few minutes.

11:09.962 --> 11:13.131
Ok, fine. We'll finish this later.

11:13.232 --> 11:16.100
Wait, Mariana's right. We
should probably keep working,

11:16.202 --> 11:17.362
but I'll come find you later?

11:20.939 --> 11:23.874
- Go on, it's fine.
- Girl, it's obviously not fine.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.110
What's up?

11:27.212 --> 11:31.482
Look, I'm totally cool with you
dating Jesus, really, it's just...

11:31.583 --> 11:33.717
every time you come over here,

11:33.818 --> 11:36.187
you always end up hanging out
with him and, I don't know.

11:36.288 --> 11:39.189
And I don't pay any
attention to you. I'm sorry.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.524
It's ok.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.771
You'll understand once you fall in love.

11:45.796 --> 11:48.464
It's just what happens.

11:48.566 --> 11:52.101
Ok. So, I don't understand because
I've never really had a boyfriend before?

11:54.404 --> 11:56.738
You know what? I could use a break.

11:56.839 --> 11:58.479
I'm going to get a soda. Do you want one?

12:01.244 --> 12:04.346
So, you actually believe
that all that's real?

12:04.447 --> 12:06.807
That hole in the ground is
where an alien spaceship went in?

12:06.849 --> 12:09.117
No, totally fake.

12:09.218 --> 12:11.919
- Ok, but you think aliens are real.
- One hundred percent.

12:12.020 --> 12:14.422
No, I don't get it. You just
admitted that all this is fake.

12:14.523 --> 12:17.157
That's how you know it is real.

12:17.259 --> 12:19.393
The government is going through such
lengths to make everything seem fake.

12:19.494 --> 12:22.363
- To throw us off.
- [giggles]

12:22.464 --> 12:26.165
- Can we have two, please?
- Right. I see, so...

12:26.267 --> 12:28.068
So, the fakeness itself
is what makes it real?

12:28.102 --> 12:30.437
- Totally.
- You're weird.

12:30.538 --> 12:31.904
It's the best way to be.

12:34.174 --> 12:36.476
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Mm-hm.

12:36.577 --> 12:39.846
- [laughs] And time travel?
- Yeah, 100 percent.

12:39.947 --> 12:43.415
Ok, then why haven't the people in the
future made themselves known here today?

12:43.516 --> 12:46.184
Because it's dangerous they
would mess with the future.

12:46.286 --> 12:48.254
Haven't you seen a movie, like, ever?

12:48.355 --> 12:49.755
All right, when you're a time traveler

12:49.856 --> 12:52.224
you have to stay invisible,

12:52.325 --> 12:56.194
you have to disappear so that
you don't wreak havoc on history.

12:56.296 --> 12:58.263
You'd be a really good time traveler.

12:58.364 --> 13:01.699
No, I wouldn't.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.067
I wreak havoc wherever I go.

13:06.903 --> 13:09.383
Well, if you could travel anywhere
in time, where would you go?

13:09.408 --> 13:12.910
Five years in the future.

13:13.011 --> 13:14.578
Five years? That's it?

13:14.679 --> 13:17.981
Yeah. I'd be 21, living on my own.

13:18.082 --> 13:21.084
Jude would be almost 18.

13:21.185 --> 13:25.789
We wouldn't have to worry about
foster families and CPS and stuff.

13:28.826 --> 13:30.693
What about Jude?

13:35.865 --> 13:38.301
He's better off without me.

13:44.675 --> 13:45.507
[beeps]

13:59.355 --> 14:01.395
Jude, what are you doing?
We're trying to work here.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.725
Everything ok?

14:08.330 --> 14:10.364
Hey, what's going on?

14:10.465 --> 14:12.032
She ran away.

14:19.466 --> 14:20.588
So no one knows anything?

14:20.679 --> 14:23.780
Ok, that's great.

14:23.882 --> 14:25.723
When was the last time
anyone saw her? Mariana?

14:25.816 --> 14:28.185
When we went to bed last night.

14:28.286 --> 14:30.287
- Ok.
- When I woke up this morning she was gone,

14:30.388 --> 14:33.056
but I figured she'd already
left for her guitar lesson.

14:33.157 --> 14:35.425
I don't believe this.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.494
We just told her we wanted to adopt her,

14:37.595 --> 14:38.695
is that what this is
about? Did we freak her out?

14:38.796 --> 14:40.597
I don't know, maybe.

14:40.698 --> 14:43.332
We're going to have to
call her probation officer.

14:43.434 --> 14:45.134
What if she comes back? Maybe
she just needed a day to herself.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.169
With every single item
she owns? Lena, come on.

14:47.271 --> 14:49.105
Won't calling her PO
just make things worse?

14:49.206 --> 14:51.641
She makes things worse for herself, Lena.

14:51.742 --> 14:55.277
And you know as well as I do that we have
to follow procedure so that they don't...

14:55.378 --> 14:57.613
Yes, I know, you're right. Go ahead.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.721
Hey, you ok?

15:05.822 --> 15:08.791
Is Callie going to go back to juvie?

15:08.892 --> 15:12.326
I don't know, honey.

15:12.428 --> 15:14.868
I don't know, but I promise you
that everything's gonna be ok.

15:20.168 --> 15:22.069

Have you heard from her?

Uh, I don't know why I'm waiting for
you to answer, this is your voicemail.

16:23.728 --> 16:27.263
Ok, um... if you know
anything, anything at all,

16:27.365 --> 16:29.165
please call me.

16:29.266 --> 16:30.933

16:40.410 --> 16:42.745

Mom, I really don't need an
"I told you so" talk right now.

16:54.857 --> 16:57.959
Hey, I did not come in
here with a "My God..."

16:58.060 --> 17:01.129
- That's good.
- I just wanted to say,

17:01.230 --> 17:03.130
you know, no matter
what happens with Callie,

17:03.231 --> 17:08.569
I certainly hope that,
well, I hope you keep Jude.

17:08.670 --> 17:12.305
He's... he's a really, really special kid.

17:16.176 --> 17:17.845

17:20.446 --> 17:22.749
he's amazing and so is his sister.

17:22.849 --> 17:24.651
I just don't understand.
I don't understand...

17:24.752 --> 17:28.755
- I don't understand, Mom.
- Shh...

17:28.856 --> 17:31.724
My love...

17:31.825 --> 17:35.894
Teenagers are just,

17:35.995 --> 17:39.264
they're just as confusing
as all get out, you know.

17:39.365 --> 17:43.501
Boy, raising you was like
reading hieroglyphics blindfolded.

17:43.603 --> 17:46.204
- What?
- [chuckles] That's it.

17:46.305 --> 17:47.906
I told your dad, "I'm
shipping her off to Nana."

17:48.007 --> 17:50.442
You have a flight to catch, Mom.

17:50.543 --> 17:51.976
I can stay if you want, you know.

17:52.077 --> 17:55.546
It's fine, Mom. It's fine.

17:55.647 --> 17:57.167
We'll be fine. We have plenty of help.

17:59.851 --> 18:01.719
What happened to our bed, Mom?

18:01.820 --> 18:04.521

18:04.623 --> 18:06.457

[both guffawing]

18:18.168 --> 18:20.604
So...

18:22.306 --> 18:24.673
Are you gonna call them?

18:24.774 --> 18:27.610
Stef and Lena, I mean.

18:27.711 --> 18:29.578
Don't you think you should...

18:29.679 --> 18:32.447
No, I can't just ruin things for Jude.

18:35.284 --> 18:38.186
Besides, I just finally did probation.

18:38.287 --> 18:41.522
So, what's your plan? You coming
all the way to Indy with me?

18:41.624 --> 18:43.858
Maybe.

18:43.959 --> 18:47.962
Would that be so bad?

18:48.063 --> 18:50.364
I'm not sure how my grandparents
are going to feel about me just

18:50.465 --> 18:52.800
bringing someone to live with us.

18:52.901 --> 18:57.237
Right. Yeah. Sure...

18:57.338 --> 19:00.206
No, I just thought...

19:00.307 --> 19:03.376
I could come with you to Indiana,

19:03.477 --> 19:05.979
and I could find a job,

19:06.080 --> 19:09.950
get my GED, find a place to live...

19:10.051 --> 19:11.450
I mean, how hard can it be?

19:11.551 --> 19:14.086
People way dumber than us do it every day.

I know your mom's not around
anymore, but what about your dad?

19:21.194 --> 19:23.729
- Could you maybe stay with him?
- In prison?

19:28.567 --> 19:32.170
Besides, even if he wasn't
in prison, he doesn't want us.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.238
- How do you know that?
- I used to write to him.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.507
He stopped writing a long time ago.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.378
I just don't understand why you're
so sure he just abandoned you.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.947
It's like you automatically assume
that everybody gives up on you.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.217
Maybe he's... maybe he's looking for you.

20:01.832 --> 20:03.499
What are you doing?

20:03.600 --> 20:04.934
I'm going to make a bed on the floor.

20:05.035 --> 20:06.736
You can sleep in the bed with me, fool.

20:06.837 --> 20:09.572

- Yeah.
