28:46.567 --> 28:49.933
CALL THESE MACHO MEN
SENTIMENTAL?

32:30.300 --> 32:32.700
YEAH,
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GO AWAY.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.900
YOU KNEW
YOU DID THIS TO ME?

32:34.933 --> 32:36.533
WELL, I WASN'T DOING IT
ON PURPOSE.

32:36.567 --> 32:39.100
YOU BRUISE EASY.

32:39.133 --> 32:41.300
I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.367
OH, MY GOD!

32:43.400 --> 32:45.133
I LOOK LIKE I'VE BEEN BEATEN.

32:45.167 --> 32:47.067
I HAVE MY INTERVIEW
TODAY.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.333
IT'S RADIO.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.700
I HAVE TO MAKE
AN IMPRESSION.

32:50.733 --> 32:51.700
AND I DON'T?

32:51.733 --> 32:53.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:53.233 --> 32:55.233
I HAVE A PHOTO SHOOT
WITH WOMEN'S FITNESS TODAY.

32:55.267 --> 32:56.467
I'M THE FIRST OUT-LESBIAN

32:56.500 --> 32:59.733
THEY'VE EVER PUT ON THE COVER,
BUT...

32:59.767 --> 33:01.167
WELL, YOU'LL
JUST BE SAYING

33:01.200 --> 33:03.367
YOU CAN BE GAY

33:05.867 --> 33:06.833
IS THERE ANY MORE?

33:06.867 --> 33:07.767
[FLUSHES]

33:07.800 --> 33:09.567

33:20.300 --> 33:23.300
HI! MY GOD,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.400
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU GUYS

33:24.433 --> 33:25.400
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

33:25.433 --> 33:26.700
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?

33:26.733 --> 33:28.600
WORKING.
TRAINING.

33:28.633 --> 33:29.767
[LAUGHS]

33:31.467 --> 33:33.333
THEY'VE BEEN HAVING SEX

33:35.567 --> 33:36.767
HI, EVERYONE.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.367

33:42.067 --> 33:45.100

33:45.133 --> 33:47.500

33:47.533 --> 33:49.067

33:53.133 --> 33:55.067
HI. HELLO.

33:56.867 --> 34:00.267
SO, UM...

34:00.300 --> 34:01.267
TINA WAS JUST SAYING

34:01.300 --> 34:04.133
THAT DANA AND ALICE...

34:04.167 --> 34:05.967
ARE HAVING SEX.

34:06.067 --> 34:07.233
[LAUGHING]

34:07.267 --> 34:09.700
THAT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

34:09.733 --> 34:11.900
THEY'D BE
IN GOOD COMPANY.

34:11.933 --> 34:13.400
[ALICE]: YEAH,
WE HAVEN'T, THOUGH.

34:13.433 --> 34:15.633
I MEAN,
I'VE BEEN BUSY,

34:15.667 --> 34:16.967
AND SHE'S BEEN BUSY...

34:17.067 --> 34:18.400
WORKING.

34:18.433 --> 34:21.500
OH, YEAH,
LET ME SEE.

34:21.533 --> 34:22.700
BUSY!

34:22.733 --> 34:24.200
OH!

34:24.233 --> 34:26.333
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

34:26.367 --> 34:27.333
NO.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.667
WORKING?

34:29.700 --> 34:30.567
OH, MY GOODNESS!

34:30.600 --> 34:31.467
WORKING IT.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.467

34:32.500 --> 34:33.467
UH-HUH.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.867
LET HER SEE IT.
LET HER SEE.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.900
OPEN IT UP.

34:36.933 --> 34:40.167
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE...

34:40.200 --> 34:41.167
OH!

34:41.200 --> 34:43.700
OH, MY GOD.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.133
OH, MY GOD.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.767
I HAVE
MY KCRW AUDITION,

34:47.800 --> 34:49.067
AND I KIND OF DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO,

34:49.067 --> 34:51.233
SO I WAS...

34:51.267 --> 34:53.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,

34:53.067 --> 34:55.500
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THIS?

34:55.533 --> 34:56.833
BECAUSE PASSION

34:56.867 --> 34:59.500
SHOULD NEVER COST YOU
RESPECT.

34:59.533 --> 35:00.567
NO, THAT--

35:00.600 --> 35:02.067
HELENA,
I COULDN'T ACCEPT THIS.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.700
IT'S HERMES.

35:03.733 --> 35:05.233
IT'S VINTAGE,

35:05.267 --> 35:06.467
AND FOR HAVING
SUCH A GOOD EYE,

35:06.500 --> 35:09.067
YOU GET TO KEEP IT.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.700
OH!

35:10.733 --> 35:11.667
WOW.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.733
YOU KNOW,

35:16.767 --> 35:18.533
I THINK I'D BETTER BE
GETTING TO WORK.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.767
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.267
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE MORNING OFF?

35:21.300 --> 35:23.567
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY
AN OPTION FOR ME.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.567
OF COURSE IT IS.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.667
YOU'RE
HAVING BREAKFAST

35:25.700 --> 35:27.067
WITH ONE
OF YOUR BOARD MEMBERS,

35:27.100 --> 35:28.233
AND WE'LL DISCUSS
WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT

35:28.267 --> 35:29.133
WITH ALLYN BARNES
TONIGHT.

35:29.167 --> 35:31.800
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.467
HELENA
HAS JUST JOINED

35:33.500 --> 35:36.533
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
FOR THE CAC.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.800
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE MEETING.

35:40.833 --> 35:41.900
WELL, BETTE,

35:41.933 --> 35:43.233
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER LATER TONIGHT

35:43.267 --> 35:44.867
AFTER THE MEETING?

35:44.900 --> 35:48.067
TINA AND I HAVE FOUND A HOUSE.

35:48.067 --> 35:49.067
OH, NO,

35:49.067 --> 35:51.567
HELENA HAS FOUND A HOUSE.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.567
WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:54.600 --> 35:55.867
WHY DON'T YOU ALL
COME OVER TONIGHT?

35:55.900 --> 35:58.667
WE'LL HAVE
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

36:01.067 --> 36:02.133
[TINA]: YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS HOUSE.

36:02.167 --> 36:03.433
IT'S AMAZING.

36:03.467 --> 36:04.867
IT'S THE ONE
ON BROAD BEACH.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.700
THE ONE IN
ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.

36:06.733 --> 36:07.500
IT'S GORGEOUS.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.933
OF COURSE IT IS.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.067
YOU KNOW,
THAT SOUNDS REALLY NICE, HELENA.

36:15.067 --> 36:17.700
MAYBE, IF I'M
NOT TOO TIRED.

36:19.067 --> 36:20.200
GOOD.

36:23.867 --> 36:24.833
BYE, BETTE.

36:24.867 --> 36:25.833
BYE.
SEE YOU LATER.

36:25.867 --> 36:26.833
GOOD LUCK.

36:26.867 --> 36:29.933
OKAY, THANKS.

36:35.167 --> 36:36.133
HEY.

36:36.167 --> 36:37.600
HEY.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.100
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

36:47.133 --> 36:48.667
NO.

36:48.700 --> 36:49.667
LOOK.

36:49.700 --> 36:53.133
YOU SAVED MY ASS,

36:53.167 --> 36:54.233
AND I'M SORRY

36:54.267 --> 36:56.100
IF I DIDN'T THANK YOU
ADEQUATELY.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.600
SO THANK YOU.

36:59.633 --> 37:03.900
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE SAMURAI CODE?

37:03.933 --> 37:05.567
RONIN?

37:05.600 --> 37:09.067
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
HONG KONG ACTION FLICKS?

37:09.100 --> 37:10.633
NO, IT'S A BOOK, ACTUALLY.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.500
I WAS REALLY INTO THAT SHIT
WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 13 AND 14.

37:13.533 --> 37:16.433
GOT MY FIRST-DEGREE BLACK BELT
IN SHOTOKAN.

37:16.467 --> 37:17.800
LUCKY FOR ME, HUH?

37:17.833 --> 37:18.800
YEAH.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.533
WELL, ACCORDING
TO THE SAMURAI CODE,

37:21.567 --> 37:22.767
IF YOU SAVE
SOMEONE'S ASS,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.567
YOU'RE FOREVER INDEBTED
TO THAT PERSON.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
YOU'RE--

37:25.633 --> 37:27.367
IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR
AND PRIVILEGE

37:27.400 --> 37:29.867
YOU CAN EVER ACHIEVE.

37:29.900 --> 37:32.733
LOOK, I SAID THANK YOU.

37:32.767 --> 37:34.433
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE YOU WANT ME TO DO.

37:34.467 --> 37:37.167
NOT YOU. ME.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.067
I'M INDEBTED TO YOU
FOR GIVING ME THAT OPPORTUNITY.

37:40.067 --> 37:42.633
NO, SO,
IT'S LIKE

37:42.667 --> 37:46.267
BASICALLY,
I'M YOUR SERVANT NOW.

37:46.300 --> 37:47.733
NO, THANK YOU.

37:47.767 --> 37:50.067
IT'S JUST THE WAY
IT'S GOT TO BE.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.200
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

37:52.233 --> 37:53.067
RIGHT.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.067
SIT, PLEASE.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.767
OH, UH, UH.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.600

BE HAVING A BEVERAGE,

38:02.800 --> 38:05.400
MY LORD?

38:05.433 --> 38:07.067
NO.

38:11.233 --> 38:12.067
[BUZZ]

38:12.067 --> 38:13.500
[WOMAN]:
HELLO?

38:13.533 --> 38:17.267
HI. THIS IS JENNY SCHECTER
FOR MR. BURR CONNOR, PLEASE.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.733
YES, MISS SCHECTER,
COME ON IN.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.433
THANK YOU.

38:31.933 --> 38:34.067
IT'S A HARD FEELING
TO DESCRIBE,

38:34.067 --> 38:37.833
BUT I THINK THAT I'VE KNOWN
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

38:37.867 --> 38:39.233
AND I FOUGHT AGAINST IT

38:39.267 --> 38:43.767
BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT MY FAMILY WOULDN'T APPROVE,

38:43.800 --> 38:47.633
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK
THAT I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

38:47.667 --> 38:50.300
YEAH,
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.300
YEAH?

38:51.333 --> 38:53.400
MM-HMM.

38:53.433 --> 38:56.867
FROM THE TIME
I WAS A SMALL BOY,

38:56.900 --> 38:58.933
I ALWAYS KNEW
I WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR.

38:58.967 --> 39:00.500
HOW COOL.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.333
SO...

39:04.367 --> 39:07.233
LIKE, WHAT KIND OF WRITERS

39:07.267 --> 39:10.300
WOULD YOU SAY
YOU MODEL YOURSELF AFTER?

39:10.333 --> 39:11.300
JUDITH KRANTZ?

39:11.333 --> 39:12.067
DANIELLE STEEL?

39:12.067 --> 39:14.567
LIKE THAT?

39:14.600 --> 39:15.800
EW.

39:15.833 --> 39:16.800
YOU'RE KIDDING.
NO, SERIOUSLY.

39:16.833 --> 39:17.800
I'M SORRY.
LET ME GUESS.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.300
LET ME GUESS?

39:19.333 --> 39:20.533
LOOKING AT YOU,

39:20.567 --> 39:22.133

39:22.167 --> 39:23.933

39:29.167 --> 39:30.133
WOW.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.400
THANK YOU.

39:32.433 --> 39:33.633
I DON'T KNOW.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.733
I MEAN, CHARLOTTE'S PUSHING ME
REALLY HARD RIGHT NOW,

39:35.767 --> 39:39.300
SO MY STYLE'S JUST EVOLVING
PRETTY FAST.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.067
WELL, I WON'T BE
PUSHING YOU, OKAY?

39:41.067 --> 39:44.767
I BASICALLY JUST NEED YOU
TO CORRECT MY GRAMMAR...

39:44.800 --> 39:45.967
MM-HMM.

39:46.067 --> 39:47.367
AND ADD AN ADJECTIVE OR TWO
HERE AND THERE.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.233
OKAY, HAVE YOU--

39:49.267 --> 39:52.333
HAVE YOU EVER WRITTEN ANYTHING
BEFORE?

39:52.367 --> 39:53.333
NO, NOT REALLY.

39:53.367 --> 39:55.067
I'VE BEEN TAPE-RECORDING MYSELF.

39:55.067 --> 39:56.200
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

39:56.233 --> 39:57.733
OH, OKAY.

39:57.767 --> 40:01.333
ACTUALLY, I HAVE THIS.

40:01.367 --> 40:03.200
NO, UH...
YOU CAN PUT THAT AWAY.

40:03.233 --> 40:05.267
OKAY, I'LL PUT IT AWAY.

40:06.833 --> 40:10.667
CAN I-- CAN I JUST USE
MY NOTEBOOK?

40:10.700 --> 40:11.900
NO, GO AHEAD.

40:11.933 --> 40:13.967
UM, OKAY, I HAVE
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU

40:14.000 --> 40:14.967
TO BEGIN.

40:15.000 --> 40:15.967
MM-HMM.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.233
ROD SEBRING.

40:20.267 --> 40:23.767
IT APPEARS
AS THOUGH YOU HAVE

40:23.800 --> 40:26.233
A VERY PROFOUND CONNECTION
WITH HIM.

40:26.267 --> 40:27.567
MM-HMM.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.467
YEAH.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.100
WELL,
WE DID THREE PICTURES TOGETHER.

40:31.133 --> 40:32.400
YEAH.

40:32.433 --> 40:36.267
THE SCENE
IN HARD MAN TO KNOW

40:36.300 --> 40:41.200
WHERE YOU CARRY MR. SEBRING
ACROSS TEXAS

40:41.233 --> 40:42.900
AFTER HE'S BEEN SHOT.

40:42.933 --> 40:46.133
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
AND QUITE ROMANTIC.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.067
MM-HMM.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.067
YOU LIKE THAT MOVIE?

40:48.100 --> 40:49.200
I LOVED IT.

40:49.233 --> 40:50.200
I'VE REALLY--

40:50.233 --> 40:51.400
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE--

40:51.433 --> 40:52.167
I LOVED IT.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
REALLY?

40:53.233 --> 40:54.200
YEAH.

40:54.233 --> 40:55.567
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE THE TYPE.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.200
OH, MY GOD,
I'VE SEEN ALL OF YOUR FILMS.

40:58.233 --> 40:59.367
I'M SURE YOU HAVE, YEAH.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.433
YEAH.

41:00.467 --> 41:01.433
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS, RIGHT?

41:01.467 --> 41:04.267
YES, BUT...

41:04.300 --> 41:06.433
OKAY, BUT MY GIRLFRIEND

41:06.467 --> 41:08.600
ACTUALLY HAS SEEN
ALL YOUR FILMS.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.167
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

41:10.200 --> 41:12.500
YEAH, WHEN SHE WAS
A LITTLE KID,

41:12.533 --> 41:13.967
SHE AND HER STEPDAD

41:14.067 --> 41:15.267
USED TO GO
TO ALL YOUR FILMS,

41:15.300 --> 41:17.600
AND NOW SHE CAN RECITE
ALL OF YOUR DIALOGUE.

41:17.633 --> 41:19.367
SO SHE'S A TOMBOY?

41:21.800 --> 41:23.067
GOSH,
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF HER

41:23.067 --> 41:25.533
LIKE THAT.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.667
I THINK SHE'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.

41:31.267 --> 41:33.067
WELL, MISS SCHECTER,

41:33.067 --> 41:35.267
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING ON OVER,

41:35.300 --> 41:36.467
AND I'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU

41:36.500 --> 41:38.200
TO LET YOU KNOW
IF I'LL BE NEEDING YOUR HELP.

41:38.233 --> 41:41.467
OH, OKAY.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.167
OKAY.

41:47.467 --> 41:52.133
UM, ARE YOU FIRING ME, UM...

41:52.167 --> 41:53.467
BECAUSE I'M GAY?

41:53.500 --> 41:56.833
WELL, I WASN'T AWARE
THAT I'D ACTUALLY HIRED YOU,

41:56.867 --> 41:58.167
BUT I DO PREFER

41:58.200 --> 42:00.300
NOT TO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS
FLAUNTED IN MY FACE.

42:10.333 --> 42:11.700
[ALICE]: MY BIG
CATCH PHRASE ENDING

42:11.733 --> 42:12.700
COULD BE,

42:12.733 --> 42:14.333
"SO GO ASK ALICE,

42:14.367 --> 42:15.433
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING ON."

42:19.700 --> 42:20.700
NO, THAT'S GOOD.

42:20.733 --> 42:22.133
THAT'S GOOD.

42:22.167 --> 42:24.567
LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO
TALK TO MY NEW CHEF.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.833
WHAT?
YEAH.

42:25.867 --> 42:27.900
YOU HIRED A NEW CHEF?
THAT'S SO COOL.

42:27.933 --> 42:30.600
GIRL, I STOLE HER
FROM A.O.C.

42:30.633 --> 42:33.067
SHE WAS TRAINING
UNDER SUZANNE GOINS.

42:33.067 --> 42:34.833
MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE
ABOUT THAT.

42:34.867 --> 42:37.567
I MEAN, IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER
THAN WHAT I HAVE.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.833
NO, NO, YOURS
IS REALLY GOOD, ALICE.

43:04.733 --> 43:05.700
I THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE

43:05.733 --> 43:06.733
A MORE
INTERESTING DEMISE

43:06.767 --> 43:07.700
THAN MUTTERING

IT'S LIKE, "AH!"

45:24.067 --> 45:24.967
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S BECAUSE--

45:25.067 --> 45:26.067
WELL,
I HAVE THIS CHART,

45:26.100 --> 45:28.100

45:28.133 --> 45:29.367

ON THE BACK OF A NAPKIN,

I WON'T REGALE YOU

TO LEO.

46:49.833 --> 46:52.733
PLEASE INTRODUCE
ALLYN BARNES.

46:52.767 --> 46:57.167
I REALLY DON'T THINK
ALLYN NEEDS ANY INTRODUCTION.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.733
SHE'S QUITE SIMPLY

46:58.767 --> 47:01.133
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
LIVING ARTISTS OF OUR TIME.

47:01.167 --> 47:02.633
NONSENSE.

47:02.667 --> 47:03.667
STOP IT.

47:03.700 --> 47:05.067
NOBODY OUTSIDE
OF THE ART WORLD

47:05.067 --> 47:07.467
EVEN KNOWS MY WORK.

47:07.500 --> 47:08.567
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.400
HARDLY ANYONE
IN THE ART WORLD

47:09.433 --> 47:10.333
KNOWS YOUR WORK.

47:10.367 --> 47:11.700
OF COURSE WE DO.

47:11.733 --> 47:13.067
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS

47:13.067 --> 47:14.333
ALLYN BARNES'S
TET OFFENSIVE.

47:14.367 --> 47:16.233
WELL, THAT WAS 1972.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.500
I MEAN, ALLYN,
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE

47:17.533 --> 47:18.767
TO SHOW THE WORK
THAT YOU'VE DONE

47:18.800 --> 47:20.167
SINCE YOU STOPPED
SHOWING IN GALLERIES?

47:20.200 --> 47:22.533
BECAUSE THAT'S
30 YEARS OF WORK

47:22.567 --> 47:23.667
THAT'S NEVER BEEN
EXHIBITED.

47:23.700 --> 47:26.667
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
I PROPOSE TO SHOW IT AT ALL.

47:26.700 --> 47:28.167
ALLYN DOESN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

47:28.200 --> 47:31.167
WE'LL DEVOTE THE ENTIRE MUSEUM,
ALL FIVE GALLERIES.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.467
THE CAC
WILL BE THE ALLYN BARNES MUSEUM.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.100
OH, ALLYN.

47:36.133 --> 47:37.433
PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

47:37.467 --> 47:38.367

WITH LEO.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.500

THE EARTH WORKS

47:40.533 --> 47:42.067
IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY?

47:42.100 --> 47:43.367
I MEAN, A SEASON IN HELL

47:43.400 --> 47:45.167
IS ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT
PIECES OF ART

47:45.200 --> 47:46.400
MADE DURING
THE LAST 20 YEARS,

47:46.433 --> 47:48.700
AND IT WAS DESTROYED
DUE TO CLEAR-CUTTING.

47:48.733 --> 47:51.133
BETTE, I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE OUT OF STEP HERE.

47:51.167 --> 47:52.300
ALLYN AND I
HAVE DISCUSSED THIS--

47:52.333 --> 47:53.833
THAT WAS WHAT THE PIECE
WAS ABOUT.

47:53.867 --> 47:55.767
YES, BUT IN
A RETROSPECTIVE,

47:55.800 --> 47:57.333
IT WOULD BE
A GLARING OMISSION.

47:57.367 --> 47:59.700
THERE HAS TO BE
SOME WAY

47:59.733 --> 48:02.333
THAT WE REFERENCE THAT WORK.

48:02.367 --> 48:04.233
I MEAN,
I FEEL INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED

48:04.267 --> 48:05.233
TO HAVE SEEN IT.

48:05.267 --> 48:07.233
YOU SAW
A SEASON IN HELL?

48:07.267 --> 48:09.900
I WROTE MY GRADUATE THESIS
ON IT.

48:09.933 --> 48:11.633
THAT WAS YOU?

48:11.667 --> 48:12.633
THAT PIECE
THAT WAS PUBLISHED

48:12.667 --> 48:13.733
IN ART FORUM?

48:13.767 --> 48:15.100
IT WAS CRUDE.

48:15.133 --> 48:17.100
I THINK THAT I'M A BETTER
CRITICAL WRITER NOW.

48:17.133 --> 48:19.967
I WAS SO FURIOUS.

48:20.067 --> 48:22.433
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
IN 18 YEARS

48:22.467 --> 48:24.233
THAT HAD PENETRATED
MY ANONYMITY.

48:24.267 --> 48:26.100
WELL,
I HAD TO SCALE THREE FENCES

48:26.133 --> 48:27.400
JUST TO GET CLOSE TO IT.

48:27.433 --> 48:28.167
I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING TO GET SHOT AT.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.667
YOU ALMOST
WERE SHOT AT,

48:30.700 --> 48:31.967
BUT IT WAS
THE BEST ARTICLE

48:32.067 --> 48:34.067
THAT'S EVER BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT MY WORK.

48:34.067 --> 48:35.867
I MEAN, YOU REALLY,
REALLY UNDERSTOOD

48:35.900 --> 48:37.100
WHAT I WAS GOING AFTER.

48:37.133 --> 48:38.933
I ATTENDED YOUR LECTURE SERIES

48:38.967 --> 48:40.400
THE SEMESTER
YOU TAUGHT AT YALE.

48:40.433 --> 48:42.900
SO YOU MUST HAVE STUDIED
WITH SI STILLMAN.

48:42.933 --> 48:45.767
OH, MY GOD, HE HATED ME.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.767
DID SI GIVE YOU
THAT EXERCISE

48:46.800 --> 48:48.367
WHERE YOU HAD TO WRITE
ABOUT A VASARELY

48:48.400 --> 48:49.900
AFTER A STORY
BY BORGES?

48:49.933 --> 48:52.067
"TLON, UQBAR, ORBIS TERTIUS."

48:52.067 --> 48:53.900
THAT WAS
THE STORY I CHOSE.

48:53.933 --> 48:55.367
[CHUCKLES]

48:55.400 --> 48:57.167
REALITY AND PERCEPTION,
