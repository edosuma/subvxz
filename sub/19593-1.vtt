00:14.080 --> 00:16.882
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

00:16.884 --> 00:19.818
- Eden's
daily message.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.253
One.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.488
No.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.757
Scratch that.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.992
Eden's daily message.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.896
All right, so, I am
getting married tomorrow.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.768
I'm staying with my
future mother in law.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.436
I just want to remind myself

00:37.438 --> 00:39.238
that I self sabotage

00:40.006 --> 00:42.741
and that I deserve to be happy.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.343
It's okay.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.146
It's okay to have
good shit happen.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.149
It's okay to be happy, you know.

01:36.629 --> 01:37.596
- No.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.205
- Eden, stand up.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.708
Girl, what are you doing?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.310
- Getting
married tomorrow.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.547
- Pull your skirt
down, your ass is showing.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.981
- Do it.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.217
- How
much did you drink?

05:52.219 --> 05:54.453
You in a total black out.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.792
Don't get in that car.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.760
Eden.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.463
Eden.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.366
- Fuck.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.968
- Hey baby, I know I'm not
supposed to talk to you

06:42.970 --> 06:44.336
on the day of the wedding,

06:44.338 --> 06:46.438
but just gimme a call back.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.108
I just wanna see when
you're gonna get here.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.211
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

06:53.213 --> 06:57.015
- Hey
Eden, it's me again.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.152
Remember when i
told you to fake it?

07:00.154 --> 07:01.119
I lied.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.024
This isn't you,
and you're a fraud.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.629
So quit lying to yourself,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.166
and do what you want.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.335
- No, please, stop, no.

12:18.637 --> 12:19.604
No!

13:11.891 --> 13:12.824
- Thank you.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.959
- Thanks a lot.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.742
I think you're
just imaging stuff.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.911
She's probably just really
busy with this wedding.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.613
I wouldn't worry about it, man.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.252
- You really haven't
talked to her?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.487
- Mm-mmm.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.788
- She knew you'd be worried,

13:43.790 --> 13:45.056
and she told me to tell you

13:45.058 --> 13:47.759
that she's focusing on
getting ready today.

13:47.761 --> 13:50.662
- You're the bridesmaid, so
i thought she'd be with you.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.297
Is there anyone else
you can think of

13:52.299 --> 13:55.033
that she may have
gotten in contact with?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.234
- Not really.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.970
She told me she wanted to
go to her own hairdresser,

13:58.972 --> 14:03.274
to focus on myself
today, and not to worry.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.047
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.849
- Hey, Eden, this is

15:52.818 --> 15:55.453
a daily message to yourself.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.555
You're getting married tomorrow,

15:57.557 --> 15:59.524
and you are gonna

15:59.526 --> 16:03.328
stand at the alter
and make a promise

16:03.330 --> 16:06.464
that you don't know
if you can keep.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.070
- Are you all right?

17:20.073 --> 17:21.406
Are you okay?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.010
I'm sorry.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.450
I'm gonna make a
call, don't worry.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.657
Hey.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.393
We got another one of those
meth heads in here again.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.495
This one looks
beat up pretty bad.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.365
I don't wanna bother
you all the time.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.533
Fuck.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.602
But I think you
should come out here.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.608
All right, let's
just go outside.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.549
Go, all right, outside.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.286
I'll come help you
in a minute, okay.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.521
Please, just have a seat.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.426
- My husband lost his job.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.895
- Expecting a lot of people.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.056
Do you want something to drink?

19:05.844 --> 19:08.980
Just sit outside
for a second, okay.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.488
- You been drinkin'?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.360
Oh.

19:59.798 --> 20:02.066
You been drinkin'.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.434
What do you call me for this?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.637
You should've called
pd or an ambulance.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.212
Oh she has a
freakin' head wound.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.884
Oh that's great, you
didn't tell me that.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.787
Technically she's
outside my jurisdiction.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.956
Okay, but since your friend
here has a freakin' head wound,

20:24.958 --> 20:26.657
now I am obligated.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.161
Well, I'm not touchin' her, so,

20:30.163 --> 20:32.730
you gotta put her in the car.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.536
I'm tellin' ya she stinks,
put her in the car.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.504
I am not touchin' her.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.908
Take her and put her in the car.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.776
Come on, boy.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.144
How are you doin' today?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.380
I'm sergeant berg.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.482
- You
wanna do it yourself?

20:51.484 --> 20:54.552
You wanna get there by yourself?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.820
- You have really cute hands.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.623
Where do you have
your nails done?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.258
Thank you so much.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.617
Martha.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.986
- Copy,
sheriff, go ahead.

21:28.988 --> 21:32.356
- Martha, can you tell Pete
to go wait in my office?

21:32.358 --> 21:34.091
I'm gonna be back
around noon, okay.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.526
I got something I gotta do.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.194
- All
right, will do.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.062
- I appreciate it.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.030
Thank you.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.148
Why don't you just relax

21:57.150 --> 21:59.717
and sit back there, all right?

22:00.752 --> 22:01.719
Please.

22:29.414 --> 22:30.614
God, oh shit.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.651
Oh god.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.191
Okay, come on now.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.659
Move your leg in the car now.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.893
That's right.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.666
Okay, all right.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.137
Jesus Christ.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.280
- She still hasn't called.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.916
- You know, everything's okay.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.953
- Do you think
she's with someone?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.221
- Like it's your birthday party

23:10.223 --> 23:11.455
when your mom ripped
her panties off

23:11.457 --> 23:13.224
and tried to sit on
uncle Rick's face?

23:13.226 --> 23:14.058
Like that?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.326
Is that what you mean?

23:15.328 --> 23:16.694
I'm sure everything's fine.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.706
- hey man, I'm
lookin' for my girl.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.041
Was she here today?

23:31.043 --> 23:33.577
- She missed her appointment.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.814
- Seriously?

23:36.816 --> 23:37.748
- She usually
calls me to let me know

23:37.750 --> 23:38.849
that she won't be here,

23:38.851 --> 23:41.385
but I haven't heard anything.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.488
I'm sure she'll call.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.300
- You're sure you want
me to leave you here?

23:56.302 --> 23:57.601
Is that what you want?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.136
Because if you want,
i can stay with you

23:59.138 --> 24:02.006
or I can take you
somewhere else.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.044
You want me to leave you here?

24:08.413 --> 24:12.116
All right, you have the right
to refuse my assistance.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.584
Have a nice day.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.624
- You's a hot mess, ain't you?

24:58.864 --> 25:00.598
Damn, you feel hot.

25:07.639 --> 25:08.606
C'mere.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.876
Oh, come here, girl.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.211
Come on, sweetie,
come on sweetie.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.279
Here we go.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.287
Wee!

25:25.524 --> 25:26.557
Gear shift.

25:26.559 --> 25:27.758
Shift it.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.792
Shift nice.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.397
- Oh, you know, you know it.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.665
You know it.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.066
Oh, I gotta go.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.236
What the hell?

25:39.238 --> 25:42.540
- No one was helping her.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.141
- Seriously?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.176
- It damn skippy.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.980
- Name?

25:53.785 --> 25:54.752
- Eden...

25:57.622 --> 25:58.556
- Oh.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.464
Come on.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.252
Okay, honey, I really need

26:28.254 --> 26:31.055
to get your blood pressure.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.690
Keep still for me.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.272
You know I'm meeting
somebody in the cafeteria.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.306
I'm leaving early today.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.608
You knew that.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.297
- Oh, come on in.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.766
Doctors are back from lunch.

28:57.102 --> 28:59.903
- It's less than six
hours before the wedding.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.905
What is going on here?

29:01.907 --> 29:03.140
- Nothing.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.242
- This does not
look like nothing.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.276
What is it?

29:08.179 --> 29:10.547
Christopher, what happened?

30:36.100 --> 30:37.301
- Mom,
i called her school,

30:37.303 --> 30:38.569
and I called her bff,

30:38.571 --> 30:42.339
and I've called what's
left of her family.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.274
Dad, can you please do
something about mom?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.844
- No, I gotta deal with this.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.290
Went to Eden's house, she
never came home last night.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.792
- So she
started drinking again?

31:01.794 --> 31:03.627
- Dude, are
you fucking kidding me?

31:03.629 --> 31:05.596
Do you think he knows?

31:24.849 --> 31:27.751
- Oh, did you
contact the police?

31:29.053 --> 31:31.221
- Yeah, can't
file a missing person's report

31:31.223 --> 31:32.456
for 24 hours.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.159
- You're
kidding me, right?

31:36.161 --> 31:37.127
- No.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.700
- It's okay, honey.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.503
What can I do to help you, baby?

32:38.323 --> 32:39.556
- Okay, well, it looks like

32:39.558 --> 32:41.058
we couldn't verify
your insurance,

32:41.060 --> 32:44.194
so we're gonna have
to transfer you.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.535
Need you to sign here and here

32:51.537 --> 32:54.338
that you understand and consent.

33:00.979 --> 33:01.945
All right.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.182
Just go through those doors.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.023
Your clothes have
been put in the Van.

33:13.025 --> 33:16.159
Just go ahead, go
through the doors.

35:01.232 --> 35:02.899
- And I've got some
clothes and hats for you.

35:02.901 --> 35:03.767
Come on.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.770
What are you, come
on, you're okay.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.071
What happened?

35:10.208 --> 35:11.775
Somebody hit you?

35:12.743 --> 35:13.977
They hit you?

35:14.679 --> 35:15.912
Yes they did.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.315
Did this like this.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.783
Didn't give you no
fucking clothes,

35:19.785 --> 35:21.785
no shoes, where's the
clothes you came in with?

35:23.255 --> 35:27.624
Why are you carrying this
fucking bag like that?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.126
Hey, if I was you,
i would've already

35:29.128 --> 35:30.594
ripped that shit
out, you hear me?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.329
Wait, let me do it.

35:35.433 --> 35:36.900
K, now get rid of this.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.036
This is fuckin'
absolutely crazy.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.204
- Do you even know if there were

35:41.206 --> 35:42.439
any accidents
reported last night?

35:42.441 --> 35:43.607
Like maybe on the five,

35:43.609 --> 35:46.376
or in the valley
like off lanker shim,

35:46.378 --> 35:48.178
something like that.

35:49.447 --> 35:52.115
Well, how many people have
been admitted to the er today?

35:52.117 --> 35:53.783
No.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.318
No, I just called this morning.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.220
Dude, can you just make
an exception, please?

35:57.222 --> 35:58.822
Just this once.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.959
Please, she is my fiance, i

36:02.961 --> 36:04.427
Don't, ah, fuck!

- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

36:50.776 --> 36:53.476
- Hey Eden.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.011
This is me.

36:55.013 --> 36:55.979
Eden.

36:57.014 --> 37:00.951
And you made a promise,
and it's a lie.

37:00.953 --> 37:03.887
And if you wanna be happy,

37:03.889 --> 37:06.122
if you wanna be happy,

37:06.124 --> 37:08.592
you know what you have to do.

38:15.826 --> 38:18.061
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.768
- Please.

38:27.672 --> 38:28.505
I just need...

38:28.507 --> 38:29.472
- Sorry.

38:31.243 --> 38:32.208
I'm sorry.

38:34.045 --> 38:34.978
You can get help.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.347
There's a shelter on normandy,

38:37.349 --> 38:39.816
and right there near sunset.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.292
- Do you need a ride?

39:24.695 --> 39:26.229
Do you need a ride?

39:26.231 --> 39:28.598
Do you wanna go some place?

39:30.401 --> 39:31.634
Are you okay?

39:36.241 --> 39:38.641
Jesus fucking Christ, lady.

39:39.910 --> 39:40.744
Why don't you get on?

39:40.746 --> 39:41.911
I'll give you a ride.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.514
You can't just
wander around here.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.083
Where you goin'?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.856
You want a ride?

40:20.585 --> 40:24.454
- Are you gonna get
your brakes fixed?

40:24.456 --> 40:25.288
- You can go on in.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.123
Everybody's welcome.

40:32.997 --> 40:33.963
It's okay.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.048
- My brothers and my sisters.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.085
Give us the strength
and the courage

40:56.087 --> 40:58.021
to make the right choices,

40:58.023 --> 41:01.191
to fight the good
fight in your name.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.097
Can I get an amen?

41:08.099 --> 41:10.366
- Amen.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.668
- Are you tired
of the sufferin'?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.436
- Yeah.

41:13.438 --> 41:16.906
- When I was thirsty,
you gave me drink.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.678
When I was a stranger,
you welcomed me.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.680
When I was naked,
you clothed me.

41:23.682 --> 41:27.250
When I was in prison,
you came to me.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.152
- Yeah.

41:29.154 --> 41:29.986
Amen.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.454
Matthew 25:35.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.091
You are your actions.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.665
In this life, you
reap what you sow.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.901
For you are the
salt of the earth,

41:44.903 --> 41:47.670
but a salt has lost its taste,

41:47.672 --> 41:50.673
how shall it gain its saltiness?

41:52.043 --> 41:53.276
It's no longer good for anything

41:53.278 --> 41:54.878
other than being
thrown on the ground

41:54.880 --> 41:57.180
and trampled under
people's feet.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.915
So when you compromise yourself,

41:58.917 --> 42:00.383
you open up the door
for other people

42:00.385 --> 42:02.151
to walk all over you.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.353
- Amen.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.389
- You gotta fight
for you at all costs.

42:21.906 --> 42:24.240
- What's up brother?

42:24.242 --> 42:25.675
Oh, this is the new person.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.977
Maybe we should have
Lila help her out.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.713
Everything's gonna be okay.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.249
You go with my wife Lila here,
and she'll take care of ya.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.984
I know the kind of
trouble you're in.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.119
We can help.

42:54.272 --> 42:58.308
- You can change in the
bathroom down the hall.

43:07.484 --> 43:11.621
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

43:11.623 --> 43:13.957
- Eden's
daily message.

43:13.959 --> 43:17.160
Please have the
strength and Serenity

43:21.265 --> 43:23.633
to be who the fuck you are.

43:26.770 --> 43:27.670
- Hey, let me just wrap this up,

43:27.672 --> 43:29.038
and I'll take you, okay?

43:29.040 --> 43:31.174
The password's forsaken.

45:34.766 --> 45:38.901
I could give you a ride
as far as Chavez ravine.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.837
I'm not sure how long
this is gonna take.

47:52.603 --> 47:55.404
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

47:55.406 --> 47:57.673
- Hey,
Eden, this is me, Eden,

47:57.675 --> 47:58.941
the wedding's tomorrow,

47:58.943 --> 48:02.445
and you just, and you
just need to have a...

48:03.146 --> 48:04.280
Okay, never mind.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.748
Shit.

48:05.750 --> 48:09.719
Hey Eden, this is the
daily message to myself.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.291
It's your day tomorrow,
and you deserve it,

48:16.059 --> 48:18.694
so stay on track, don't rebel,

48:21.265 --> 48:24.400
you're worth it,
you're good enough.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.469
Fake it till you make it.

48:26.471 --> 48:27.937
You hear me?

48:27.939 --> 48:29.005
Oh my fucking god.

48:29.007 --> 48:30.640
This is so stupid.

48:56.733 --> 49:00.303
Look what we got here.

49:05.309 --> 49:06.609
- We got real.

50:33.230 --> 50:36.065
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

50:36.067 --> 50:38.868
- Eden's
daily message.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.336
I'm gettin' married tomorrow,

50:40.338 --> 50:43.806
and I'm gonna stand
up, and I'm gonna...

50:46.076 --> 50:48.444
Tell everybody that I am...

50:50.347 --> 50:53.649
A liar, and I do not
deserve anything.

50:55.252 --> 50:57.253
And I don't deserve it,

50:57.255 --> 50:59.922
because I don't really want it.

51:01.158 --> 51:02.124
And I live

51:03.460 --> 51:04.427
a charade,

51:06.129 --> 51:08.497
and before I did this shit,

51:10.000 --> 51:11.300
I was perfect.

52:01.585 --> 52:03.519
- Can I help you?

52:11.394 --> 52:12.361
Oh.

52:28.945 --> 52:32.314
So we took it way in
here on both sides,

52:32.316 --> 52:34.383
and we covered it with lace,

52:34.385 --> 52:36.852
and so you can't even see it.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.320
So there you go.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.142
- Thank you.

53:00.144 --> 53:02.678
- You're welcome.

53:57.300 --> 53:59.535
- Oh my god.

54:12.616 --> 54:15.050
That man was here
looking for you.

54:15.052 --> 54:16.218
- Christopher.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.086
- Yesterday.

54:17.088 --> 54:18.487
A big, big man.

56:38.528 --> 56:41.663
Yes, I ordered a
cake for a wedding.

56:43.833 --> 56:46.568
Christopher, Christopher parks.

56:47.737 --> 56:48.704
Parks.

56:49.606 --> 56:51.173
Oh.

56:51.175 --> 56:53.642
It's been delivered already.

56:58.548 --> 56:59.982
Doc wyler beach.

57:01.618 --> 57:02.584
Thank you.

57:09.926 --> 57:12.394
- Everybody's been called.

57:12.396 --> 57:16.165
I still have to
call the tent place.

57:23.773 --> 57:24.773
Chris is that your...

57:24.775 --> 57:25.941
Oh my god.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.309
- Hello.

57:27.311 --> 57:28.510
- What?

57:28.512 --> 57:30.179
What is it?

57:30.181 --> 57:32.147
- It's her, she's okay.

57:32.149 --> 57:33.449
What happened?

58:36.112 --> 58:38.180
- Do you need anything?

58:45.188 --> 58:47.356
- Congratulations, man.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.957
She's a good girl.

58:48.959 --> 58:51.026
She's got good heart.

58:51.028 --> 58:51.994
- Thanks.

58:52.962 --> 58:54.263
- You know what, I know you had

58:54.265 --> 58:55.931
a rough ride as a kid, Chris,

58:55.933 --> 58:57.766
but the future is all you, bro.

58:57.768 --> 58:59.601
I wanna see you happy,

58:59.603 --> 59:02.237
and no matter what
happens today,

59:02.239 --> 59:03.438
I love you, man.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.574
I want you to know that.

59:05.576 --> 59:06.842
- Thank you.

59:57.060 --> 59:59.595
- Chris, wait up.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.932
Guys, hey guys.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.667
Okay, you know that brides
sometimes don't show up

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:07.202
because they're shy, right?

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.737
It's an actual thing.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:12.074
I don't know, it's like
stage fright or something.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.977
- God,
you're stupid.

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:19.815
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:22.084
- Hello
Eden, it's Eden,

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.453
leaving you your daily message.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.655
So, I just wanna say
that you're probably

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.057
feeling a little bit crazy,

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:34.396
but I just wanna remind
you that Chris loves you,

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:36.999
and tomorrow's gonna
be an amazing day.

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:38.634
So, you can do it.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.070
Do it!

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:43.038
Woo!

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:46.174
Fake it till ya make it, girl.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.142
Fuck.

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:40.395
- Congratulations!

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.778
- Hello, would
you like to leave a message?

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.348
- Hey
Eden, this is me, Eden.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.454
I'm leaving this
message to myself,

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.192
because I know you're losing it.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.863
Your future mother in law

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:50.665
forced you to stay at her house.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.934
Wedding tomorrow,

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.238
and you needed a drink.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:01.843
Please remember how
sabotage you are

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:03.879
when good shit happens.

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:08.250
Don't fuck this up, Eden.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.319
Please stay on track.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.955
Do not rebel.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.430
Just fake it till you make it.

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.702
That is so fucking stupid.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:40.782
This is me, Eden.

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:46.188
I know you're losing it.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.395
I'm gettin' married tomorrow,

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:54.663
and I'm gonna stand up,

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.264
and I'm gonna tell everybody

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:57.833
that I am a liar.

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.041
Hey Eden.

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:10.212
If you really love yourself,

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:12.614
if you really wanna be happy,

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.917
then do what you
need to do to be you.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.987
Eden, you are

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.725
a fucking maniac.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:28.797
But I love it.

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.099
I love that.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.402
You know who you are,

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:36.705
so just be you regardless.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.309
Yeah, start telling
yourself the truth.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:46.715
Oh yeah, that's it.

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.485
I'm out.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:07.202
- I've never done this
to a bride before.

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.886
I'll be careful.

01:05:57.888 --> 01:05:59.020
- Ow.
