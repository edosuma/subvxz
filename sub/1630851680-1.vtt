Are you okay?

Uh, he's in the bathroom.

what does that, uh, mean?

10:28.012 --> 10:30.016

10:30.018 --> 10:32.021
Do you wanna know?
- Yeah.

10:35.008 --> 10:36.018
Okay. I'll tell him.

10:36.020 --> 10:39.017
Uh, he says that this could get
very ugly for him.

10:39.019 --> 10:41.007
You played a decent move.

10:41.009 --> 10:43.014

10:43.016 --> 10:45.015
and say that you were unwell

10:45.017 --> 10:47.003
then maybe there's a deal here.

10:47.005 --> 10:48.011
You know what?
Tell him, legally,

10:48.013 --> 10:50.002
it's not wise for me
to talk to him,

10:50.004 --> 10:52.000
but that I'm going to be
in contact with the government

10:52.002 --> 10:54.004
and that this would be
a good moment for him
to step down.

10:54.006 --> 10:56.009
- Okay, he heard.

10:57.023 --> 11:00.019
...that I'm gonna
grind his fucking bones

11:00.021 --> 11:02.012
to make my bread.

11:02.014 --> 11:03.018
Uh, he says, in that case,

11:03.020 --> 11:07.018
he's going to grind up
your bones to make his bread.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.008
Okay?

11:09.010 --> 11:12.010
Well, tell him,

11:12.012 --> 11:16.004
that I'm gonna run up off
the fucking beanstalk.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.019
Okay. Logan?
Yeah, he says in that case

11:18.021 --> 11:22.018
he's going to run up
off the, uh, beanstalk?

11:25.009 --> 11:28.016
He's kind of laughing.
But not, like, nice laughing.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.010
Just tell him he should
step back and cooperate.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.023
I don't want to see him
behind bars.

11:32.001 --> 11:33.014
<i>We may no longer be
on the same side,</i>

11:33.016 --> 11:34.018
<i>but I don't want that.</i>

11:34.020 --> 11:36.014

11:41.005 --> 11:42.017
It was a play,
it was a fucking move.

11:42.019 --> 11:44.017
So, don't act like a cunt to me

11:44.019 --> 11:46.009

fucking wash!

11:48.019 --> 11:50.018
Okay, bye.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.017
What--what--what did he say?

11:52.019 --> 11:56.015
- Um...
- Any actual legal or,
or physical threats?

11:56.017 --> 11:58.007
- Uh--
- You know what?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.020
Don't need that in my head.

11:59.022 --> 12:02.010
Just put it in an e-mail
and send it to yourself,
in case it comes up.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.014
Okay. Action stations.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.020
I gave him a chance. Gerri.

12:07.022 --> 12:09.000
Everyone, let's go.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.012
Okay. Great.

12:12.014 --> 12:14.017
So, I suggest I call DOJ

12:14.019 --> 12:16.007
and just right away
let them know

12:16.009 --> 12:20.022
how horrified we were to learn
of these, um, allegations

12:21.000 --> 12:23.010
and that we intend to form
a special committee

12:23.012 --> 12:25.021
and we can tell them
which white shoe law firms--

12:25.023 --> 12:29.001
I have ideas, we are considering
to thoroughly investigate

12:29.003 --> 12:31.017
and promptly report back
their findings.

12:31.019 --> 12:34.000
Right. But do we cooperate?

12:34.002 --> 12:36.020
With the government? Yeah,
I think we have to cooperate.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.006
I mean, we were under
pressure already--

12:38.008 --> 12:39.020
Unless we don't?

12:39.022 --> 12:42.001
Yeah, but real world?

12:42.003 --> 12:44.006
I mean,
this is a public company.

12:44.008 --> 12:46.016
We don't know what they have
or what they might get.

12:46.018 --> 12:48.002
There's only one real play here.

12:48.004 --> 12:50.020
And what if I don't want to pull
down my panties down so fast?

12:50.022 --> 12:52.007
Then you pull up
the draw-bridge.

12:52.009 --> 12:55.000
It's politically motivated.
"Come get us, motherfuckers."

12:55.002 --> 12:56.007
What's our story?

12:56.009 --> 12:59.007
The story is--is that he's
exploiting these poor women.

12:59.009 --> 13:00.019
And that's very sad.

13:00.021 --> 13:02.013
You were grooming him
for the top.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.013
But you know?
He's a junkie and he blew it.

13:05.015 --> 13:07.015
He's a bitter fuck up
that needs psychiatric help.

13:07.017 --> 13:10.019
And of course
you're the big baddie,
so everybody jumped on board.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.002
And what about these papers?

13:12.004 --> 13:14.001
Uh, they're fake. Or stolen,

13:14.003 --> 13:16.016
if they even exist. Are you
worried about the papers?

13:16.018 --> 13:19.012
Hmm? We'll go after him
for corporate theft.

13:19.014 --> 13:21.021
This is, you know, not nice
thing to say about your son

13:21.023 --> 13:25.007
but maybe you chop him
into a million pieces
and toss him in the Hudson?

13:25.009 --> 13:27.006
You destroy Kendall,
it falls apart.

13:27.021 --> 13:29.009
What do we think?

13:30.009 --> 13:31.014
How's the price?

13:32.019 --> 13:35.020
Well, uh, net-net, it's steady.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.013
But institutions are dumping
in case this kills us

13:38.015 --> 13:41.000
and arbs are buying in case
Sandy and Stewy win.

13:41.002 --> 13:42.016
Yeah,
Kendall has changed the game.

13:42.018 --> 13:46.000
Noncooperation now, it's not--
it's too...

13:46.002 --> 13:48.009
It's too hot out there.
I think it's very high risk.

13:48.011 --> 13:50.012
Yeah, well, everything's
high risk if you're a pussy.

13:50.014 --> 13:52.011
- Hey, I eat red meat. Okay?
Well...

13:52.013 --> 13:53.020
I'm just--the repercussions.

13:53.022 --> 13:55.019
Yeah, but I think
you're looking too small.

13:56.012 --> 13:57.012
We do a dance

13:57.014 --> 13:59.022
and we bide our time
'til the election.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.015
ATN anointy-nointy the Raisin
for a second term?

14:03.017 --> 14:06.002
New Attorney General.
And by then,

14:06.004 --> 14:07.009
this has gotten a little stale,

14:07.011 --> 14:10.000
Kendall will self-destruct
because it's his favorite.

14:10.002 --> 14:11.022
And this all fades
the fuck away.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.001
If I stop picking at scabs,

14:15.003 --> 14:17.018
saying, "Sorry,"
who knows where we'll end up.

14:17.020 --> 14:21.008
Class actions from the chancers
and opportunists.

14:21.010 --> 14:23.003
Admissions of wrongdoing...

14:24.005 --> 14:26.007
- Billions out of the door.
- Fuck!

14:26.009 --> 14:28.003
If you were to call the AG
right now and shout at him,

14:28.005 --> 14:30.015
- could we find out
if that'd be okay?
- Hugo, can you find out

14:30.017 --> 14:32.020
what would happen
if Logan called the AG?

14:32.022 --> 14:35.016
Get the Raisin.
Let's go to the top.

14:36.015 --> 14:38.006
Let's get the President.

14:38.008 --> 14:39.023
But gentle. Okay?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.011
Anything else?

14:43.008 --> 14:44.016
Do we want to order some food?

14:44.018 --> 14:47.013
Food? Swallow.
We're on saliva

14:47.015 --> 14:51.011
and adrenaline here,
until we get on a plane.
All right?

14:51.013 --> 14:52.023
No local foods.

14:53.001 --> 14:55.000
I get the shits, we're fucked.

14:55.002 --> 14:58.006
- Hugo! Let's go.
- Okay.

14:58.008 --> 14:59.022
We've lingered
long e-fucking-nough!

15:00.000 --> 15:03.017
Okay, guys, uh,
this way please.
The plane's on the tarmac.

15:03.019 --> 15:06.019
- Let's get going.
I will definitely call you back.

15:08.009 --> 15:09.017
<i>Okay.</i>

15:09.019 --> 15:12.004
<i>Uh, you're the number one
trending topic,</i>

15:12.006 --> 15:13.012
ahead of Tater Tots.

15:14.010 --> 15:17.004
And the Pope followed you.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.015
- Okay... wow!
Uh...

15:19.017 --> 15:22.014
Okay, no, this is not the--
is this the real?

15:22.016 --> 15:26.004
- No, I don't think
this is the Pope.
- Right, great. Thanks Greg.

15:26.006 --> 15:28.022
No, it's, it's a pope.
It's not the Pope.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.016
<i>Frank? Hey.
Listen, you don't need to speak.</i>

15:37.018 --> 15:39.011
I just want to say,

15:39.013 --> 15:42.005
sorry I didn't talk to you
before, but I just want
to let you know

15:42.007 --> 15:44.023
there's a place for you
in the company I'm gonna run.

15:45.001 --> 15:46.015
<i>You just need to tell him
time's up, okay?</i>

15:46.017 --> 15:49.003
<i>He steps back
and we can cool this down.</i>

15:49.005 --> 15:51.010
<i>Someone like you steps in,
a lot of respect.</i>

15:51.012 --> 15:54.005
<i>You know, a lot of folks
would put in a shift for you.</i>

15:54.007 --> 15:55.015
<i>We steady the ship together.</i>

15:55.017 --> 15:57.006
Okay? I did this for you, man.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.007
Did this for us.

15:59.009 --> 16:04.001
<i>For the soul of the company.
This is exciting, Frank. Okay.</i>

16:09.023 --> 16:14.001
- Uh, Gerri. Get me Gerri.
- Okay. Um...

16:16.019 --> 16:18.008
Oh, straight to voicemail.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.020
The vans are here.

16:22.017 --> 16:25.001
So, the President
is basically supportive,

16:25.003 --> 16:26.011
but they think
it might be best for there

16:26.013 --> 16:29.015
not to be a call with you
on the White House log today.

16:29.017 --> 16:32.003
Like he can't make
a fucking private call?

16:32.005 --> 16:33.020
We got offered Michelle-Anne.

16:33.022 --> 16:35.013
Oh, the pantsuit barnacle?

16:36.008 --> 16:37.012
I got her if you wanna.

16:37.014 --> 16:40.003
No. Fuck it. No.
I don't talk to the babysitter.

16:40.005 --> 16:42.001
You fuckin' sound her out.

16:42.003 --> 16:45.006
That'd be great.
Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.

16:50.013 --> 16:54.019
- Where's Karl?
- Yeah. He really feels
he needs a sandwich.

16:54.021 --> 16:56.021
- A sandwich?
- Yeah. I tried to tell him.
But...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.002
Guys, we have another van
for you over here.

17:00.004 --> 17:01.018
Okay? Right this way.

17:04.011 --> 17:06.017
Michelle? Gerri Kellman.
How you doing?

17:06.019 --> 17:09.011
Listen, I just wanted to say
it was all nonsense

17:09.013 --> 17:12.001
and we know the President
will be supportive,

17:12.003 --> 17:13.009
but we just wanted to answer--

17:13.011 --> 17:16.009
to, to offer to answer
any questions he may have.

17:16.011 --> 17:17.021
<i>Hi, yeah,</i>

17:17.023 --> 17:22.004
Gerri, I think he just feels for
Logan at this difficult time.

17:22.006 --> 17:24.001
Great, well, just let him know

17:24.003 --> 17:25.017
that we are not asking
for favors.

17:26.023 --> 17:28.007
<i>We hear you.</i>

17:28.009 --> 17:30.019
We just wouldn't,
simply in terms of resources,

17:30.021 --> 17:32.015
want DOJ to follow Kendall off

17:32.017 --> 17:34.008
down this rabbit hole
of bitterness.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.005
<i>Okay.</i>

17:37.007 --> 17:40.018
<i>Well, you know how much
the President respects Logan.</i>

17:41.017 --> 17:42.019
<i>Okay?</i>

17:42.021 --> 17:46.018
Great. So, off the record, um...

17:46.020 --> 17:48.020
what's the temperature
at Main Justice?

17:48.022 --> 17:50.005
Any danger of them

17:50.007 --> 17:52.023
or Southern District
going Batman on this?

17:53.001 --> 17:56.002
<i>Um, the Attorney General
is very smart.</i>

17:56.004 --> 17:57.009
Oh, we all love Bhavick.

17:57.011 --> 17:59.016
He'll--
he'll see through this, right?

17:59.018 --> 18:01.020
<i>It's just,
the DAG likes to think</i>

18:01.022 --> 18:04.006
<i>she's something
of a straight-shooter.</i>

18:04.008 --> 18:06.002
<i>Marilyn's prickly.</i>

18:06.004 --> 18:09.002
<i>So that's your only issue,
Marilyn.</i>

18:09.004 --> 18:10.016
Well, maybe you should
just fire her!

18:13.010 --> 18:14.022
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

18:15.000 --> 18:17.022
<i>-Justice can't do nothing.</i>
- Well, they could...

18:20.005 --> 18:22.004
<i>It's out of our hands.</i>

18:22.006 --> 18:23.020
Not if you grab it.

18:25.010 --> 18:28.011
Um, but look, we don't want
to fall out with him.

18:28.013 --> 18:30.009
<i>Well no, he's the president.</i>

18:30.011 --> 18:32.019
No, sure, but,
do we want to get the old guys

18:32.021 --> 18:35.017
on the blower
so they can just chat for five?

18:35.019 --> 18:37.008
<i>This will all be great, Gerri.</i>

18:37.010 --> 18:39.022
<i>Just find me whenever,
on anything, okay?</i>

18:40.000 --> 18:43.007
Great, well, I appreciate
getting a read. Um, many thanks.

18:46.005 --> 18:47.009
Yeah. Good?

18:48.006 --> 18:50.010
Good work. Basically supportive.

18:50.012 --> 18:51.014
Good work, Gerri.

18:57.007 --> 18:59.016
Okay, we're, uh,
fueled and tooled.

18:59.018 --> 19:02.007
We all set for New York City and
a fuck fest?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.005
- Gerri, stay.
- Oh.

19:04.007 --> 19:07.016
Excuse me. Sorry.

19:10.022 --> 19:13.011
<i>Oh, Shiv...</i>

19:13.013 --> 19:16.010
Shivy, Shivy, Shivy.

19:17.009 --> 19:19.000
How are you doing over there?

19:19.002 --> 19:22.002
<i>You ready to come over?
I got a spot for you.</i>

19:22.004 --> 19:26.002
Hello, hello?
Okay, Jess, what do we got?

19:26.004 --> 19:28.017
Um, we have
independent directors.

19:28.019 --> 19:30.014
- Boom.
- Opinion shapers, A list.

19:30.016 --> 19:33.009
And then we've got Ewan, Laird.

19:33.011 --> 19:35.008
- Good.
- Your mom, um...

19:35.010 --> 19:38.006
Greg's mom, Josh Arenson,
and Marcia?

19:38.008 --> 19:40.022
<i>Great.</i>
- Oh, Greg. How's, uh...

19:41.000 --> 19:43.005
Um, I mean...

19:44.004 --> 19:46.008
Headline is, uh,

19:46.010 --> 19:50.005
the internet is big,
uh, obviously, uh...

19:50.007 --> 19:53.010
and I haven't--I can't--
I--I couldn't read it all,

19:53.012 --> 19:57.008
but I'm working through,
I guess, um...

19:57.010 --> 20:00.006
Yeah. That's the big picture
over here at Media Monitoring.

20:00.008 --> 20:02.020
- Is it positive, Greg?
It's super positive.

20:02.022 --> 20:04.004
- Super positive?
Yeah.

20:04.006 --> 20:06.021
The negative stuff does tend
to stick in the mind a little

20:06.023 --> 20:10.001
just 'cause it's quite,
uh, visceral.

20:10.003 --> 20:12.003
But yeah. Basically, very good.

20:12.005 --> 20:16.012
Nice memes, good memeage,
and... and, uh, so on.

20:17.017 --> 20:19.011
<i>Hello?</i>
- Nae? Hey.

20:19.013 --> 20:21.023
I got a million calls,
but I wanted to say hi.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.013
- You see it?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:23.015 --> 20:27.016
<i>Yeah, seems like maybe you're
the best man in the world?</i>

20:27.018 --> 20:29.022
- Yeah, fuck you.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
<i>Yeah, but I mean,
maybe you are.</i>

20:32.002 --> 20:33.016
Okay, ha, ha, ha, sure.

20:34.019 --> 20:36.017
- But what if I am?
<i>No, sure.</i>

20:36.019 --> 20:40.022
<i>But, um, seriously, Ken,
just for a second here.</i>

20:41.000 --> 20:42.021
<i>-What if you really are?</i>
- Um, Ken?

20:42.023 --> 20:44.006
- Yeah?
- We're almost there, so...

20:44.008 --> 20:47.012
Uh, Nae, hey, I'm arriving
at Waystar. Can you come see me?

20:48.004 --> 20:50.001
Oh, um, Remi's saying that

20:50.003 --> 20:52.014
maybe they're trying
to cancel your access?

20:52.016 --> 20:55.000
- Later, Nae. Hey, I love you.
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:55.002 --> 20:57.004
Okay, well--well--
well, they can't.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.020
Sure, but, uh, they maybe did?

20:59.022 --> 21:01.016
<i>All right.
Fuck it, keep driving.</i>

21:01.018 --> 21:02.020
<i>There's press at my place, yeah?</i>

21:02.022 --> 21:05.005
<i>Uh, yes.
So, where are we going?</i>

21:05.007 --> 21:07.019
<i>Oh, God. This is crazy.</i>

21:07.021 --> 21:11.007
This is like--this is like O.J.

21:11.009 --> 21:14.003
I--I mean, except if O.J.
never killed anyone.

21:14.005 --> 21:15.021
Who said I never killed anyone?

21:18.008 --> 21:20.010
- What character is that?
- Juice is loose, baby!

21:22.007 --> 21:26.018
Uh, Gerri. Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. All good.

21:26.020 --> 21:28.019
Just gonna go talk to Hugo.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.016
Because now, we're gonna go,
it looks like

21:30.018 --> 21:32.015
in the first instance,
to Sarajevo.

21:32.017 --> 21:34.012
What the fuck. Sarajevo?

21:34.014 --> 21:36.004
I think Michelle-Anne
freaked him out.

21:37.013 --> 21:39.013
Other places to consider.

21:39.015 --> 21:43.015
Bahrain, Bosnia, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Maldives,

21:43.017 --> 21:46.003
Morocco, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the Vatican?

21:46.014 --> 21:48.010
Okay. Fuck.

21:49.022 --> 21:52.002
What do all these countries
have in common?

21:52.004 --> 21:54.017
They're all made up?
They're lands with dragons!

21:54.019 --> 21:58.023
No, I imagine that none of them
have an extradition treaty
with the U.S.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.010
- Okay. Fuck.
- You know, what I thought
we could do,

22:01.012 --> 22:04.014
um, is discreetly dangle
some juicy contributor contracts

22:04.016 --> 22:06.015
to the more
responsible prosecutors?

22:06.017 --> 22:08.015
We're going to Sarajevo.

22:08.017 --> 22:10.020
What? To Sarajevo?
Excuse me, the fuck--

22:10.022 --> 22:14.002
- It's fine. Shut up.
- Hey. Look.

22:16.006 --> 22:18.009
I'm not sure
how much cover I've got.

22:19.010 --> 22:21.023
I need to talk to a lawyer
on my position.

22:22.016 --> 22:23.020
Who's a tough bastard?

22:23.022 --> 22:26.021
What? Like a kind of
Layo Upton type motherfucker?

22:26.023 --> 22:29.018
A woman would be great.
Like a Lisa Arthur?

22:29.020 --> 22:33.018
- She did the hookers, right?
- She repped
the trafficked sex workers, yes.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.005
It'd be great
to have her credibility.

22:35.007 --> 22:37.007
Yeah. There are
three or four good women,

22:37.009 --> 22:40.000
but Lisa has an excellent brain.
She is a winner.

22:40.002 --> 22:41.023
You go with Layo,
people will be like,

22:42.001 --> 22:44.020
"Oh, he's going scorched earth.
Maybe he can fight this."

22:44.022 --> 22:46.021
We get Lisa,
people will be like,

22:46.023 --> 22:48.017
"Gee, maybe this is bullshit."

22:48.019 --> 22:52.013
- Can I get her?
Well, uh, Shiv...

22:52.015 --> 22:53.021
- Uh, yeah! I...
Right?

22:53.023 --> 22:55.018
I mean, you know? I'm...

22:55.020 --> 22:58.013
She's--Yeah, she's a pretty--
She's a friend.

22:58.015 --> 23:00.015
- Could you get her for me?
I don't know. I mean,

23:00.017 --> 23:03.020
she fucking loves winning
and she loves money. So, uh...

23:03.022 --> 23:06.012
- Listen. Listen.
- I don't... know.

23:06.014 --> 23:08.004
Cooperate or not,

23:09.009 --> 23:10.020
to keep the board sweet,

23:12.003 --> 23:13.020
I may need to step back
a little.

23:13.022 --> 23:15.023
Okay. Oh, well then,
who would--

23:16.001 --> 23:19.016
I don't want to go back
right now. Does that play?

23:19.018 --> 23:23.023
Yeah, I mean, I just--
I, I want you safe.

23:24.001 --> 23:26.012
- That's the most
important thing.
- Yeah.

23:27.015 --> 23:29.022
Okay. Okay, okay, uh,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.018
Shiv, Roman, Gerri
are gonna go back

23:32.020 --> 23:34.010
to manage New York.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.013
No need for me
to go running back

23:36.015 --> 23:38.013
like a slapped girl, looks weak.

23:38.015 --> 23:41.008
- Great! Another plane.
- Want me to go?

23:41.010 --> 23:43.023
No, no, no. I don't trust you.

23:44.001 --> 23:47.021
You're gonna stay with me.
Karl can monitor board liaison.

23:47.023 --> 23:50.006
Tom here, across ATN.

23:50.008 --> 23:52.006
I'll make the call
on the lawyer.

23:52.008 --> 23:56.015
I like--I like Layo, but, uh,
I need to think about it.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.023
Council of war on the plane!

23:59.001 --> 24:02.017
Go on, fuck off back there,
Tumbledown Dick.

24:02.019 --> 24:06.002
Logan, uh, this plane has now
been rerouted to Sarajevo.

24:06.004 --> 24:09.000
It's ready to go. And, uh,
I will get another plane.

24:09.002 --> 24:11.019
Uh, Logan?
Do you need...

24:11.021 --> 24:13.016
- Oh, Con?
- This guy? Yeah.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.008
- Con, yes, yes, yes.
Very important.

24:16.010 --> 24:20.007
Can you hold the fort here?
Can you keep this all secure?

24:20.009 --> 24:23.011
You mean hold down the Balkans
with just two divisions?

24:24.013 --> 24:25.021
I can try.

24:28.019 --> 24:31.003
See you guys.
Have a good trip.

24:31.005 --> 24:33.006
- Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

24:33.008 --> 24:36.005
Oh, listen, my guy made contact
and they wanna know

24:36.007 --> 24:39.009
if we wanna do
a marketing push with the play.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.021
- Okay.
- You know?

24:40.023 --> 24:42.018
The whole hate watch angle,

24:42.020 --> 24:45.009
uh, you know, like, pick out
all the worst reviews

24:45.011 --> 24:47.004
like, you know, "Kill yourself
if you got a ticket,"

24:47.006 --> 24:48.011
or the one about brain poison.

24:48.013 --> 24:50.017
Yeah, okay, I know
all of them, Con. Thank you.

24:50.019 --> 24:52.020
- That's so sweet.
- Right. So, jump on
the irono-cycle

24:52.022 --> 24:54.023
and, uh, make it into a thing

24:55.001 --> 24:57.005
for the hipsters
and the dipshits.

24:57.007 --> 25:00.003
Oh.
- We could make
a nice little return.

25:00.005 --> 25:05.009
Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah, I mean.
Yeah. That sounds exciting.

25:05.011 --> 25:06.021
Yeah?

25:06.023 --> 25:10.002
Hey, so,
we'll talk about things...

25:10.004 --> 25:11.020
- when we get back, right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:11.022 --> 25:15.013
Yeah? Okay. Cool.
- Of course. Yeah, okay.
So, yeah.

25:15.015 --> 25:19.010
- You know, 'cause I love you.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thanks.

25:19.022 --> 25:21.005
Thank you.

25:21.007 --> 25:23.013
And, uh... Yeah, don't...

25:25.007 --> 25:26.010
You'll see him again.

25:27.021 --> 25:30.016
Well, yeah, obviously
I'll see him again, Tom.

25:30.018 --> 25:33.009
- Why would you say that?
- I'm being nice, Shiv.

25:33.011 --> 25:34.023
If you're worried
that he won't come home,

25:35.001 --> 25:37.012
I think that's unlikely.
Okay, so...

25:37.014 --> 25:38.021
Well, I know that.

25:38.023 --> 25:41.001
Okay. Great. It's fine.

25:41.003 --> 25:42.021
Okay.
Okay.

25:43.022 --> 25:45.021
Oh, did Ken call you?

25:45.023 --> 25:48.023
Ken? Me? No.
No, no, no.

25:49.001 --> 25:50.021
Not to speak. No.
Why, did he call you?

25:50.023 --> 25:52.007
- No.
No.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.020
No. No, I was just wondering.

25:55.016 --> 25:58.012
- Okay. Well, look after him.
- Okay.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.023
- Keep in touch.
- Okay.

26:13.009 --> 26:16.014
So, just--This is a safe place
to be, yeah.

26:16.016 --> 26:18.000
So just buzz me in.

26:25.013 --> 26:27.010
Don't tweet
from RealKendallRoy.

26:27.012 --> 26:30.001
- I'm not--I'm not
tweeting from your account.
- I'm serious.

26:30.003 --> 26:31.013
I'm not.
I'm tweeting from my account.

26:31.015 --> 26:32.017
- Okay.

26:34.019 --> 26:36.009
- Just chill here for a second.
- Right.

26:37.003 --> 26:38.016
Hello, hello!

26:38.018 --> 26:41.001
- Hey!
- Hey.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.015
- Are you okay?
How are you doing?
- I'm good.

26:44.017 --> 26:46.016
You're good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:51.002 --> 26:53.000
Is it okay if I bring
in the guys?

26:53.002 --> 26:54.019
Sure. Are they vetted?

26:54.021 --> 26:56.011
- Yeah. They're legit,
right, Jess?
Yeah.

26:56.013 --> 26:58.013
- All the Emirati use the firm.
Yeah, vetted. Totally.

26:58.015 --> 27:00.001
Oh, well, amazing.

27:00.003 --> 27:03.003
So, is this okay to,
to do a few calls?

27:03.005 --> 27:04.016
I wouldn't ask if I had options.

27:06.005 --> 27:07.001
Yes, yes.

27:07.003 --> 27:08.007
Thank you.
- Of course.

27:08.009 --> 27:10.011
- Thanks, Rava.
Yeah.

27:10.013 --> 27:12.002
Hey, Greg.
- I'll close it up.

27:12.004 --> 27:14.008
Yeah, good. Wow.

27:15.004 --> 27:16.018
So, hey, wow!

27:16.020 --> 27:19.015
- You really did it, huh?
- I fucking did it.

27:20.012 --> 27:23.011
Yeah, well,
it's been in the mail.

27:25.023 --> 27:27.016
It has been in the mail.

27:27.018 --> 27:29.023
You know, like you always said,
it was either this

27:30.001 --> 27:33.001
or, you know, go to Mount Athos
and become a monk.

27:33.003 --> 27:35.021
- Oh, yeah. This monastery
on Mount Athos.
- Mount Athos.

27:35.023 --> 27:38.010
That, that, that could have been
a more logical choice.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.009
Surprise, surprise.

27:41.005 --> 27:43.000
You came here for what? A, uh...

27:43.002 --> 27:46.016
- pat on the back?
- No, just, uh, the press.
They're, they're swarming mine.

27:46.018 --> 27:49.000
And I, I need a hiding hole
for meetings.

27:49.002 --> 27:53.010
Plus, I actually wanted
to see you and the kids.

27:53.012 --> 27:54.022
You know, I, kind of, like...

27:58.010 --> 27:59.016
It was kind of for you guys.

28:01.005 --> 28:02.006
Yeah, well...

28:04.000 --> 28:05.022
Hey, hey, I, um...

28:06.000 --> 28:07.021
I didn't see it but I've just...

28:07.023 --> 28:10.010
I've been up against it
at work but...

28:10.012 --> 28:12.021
- people were saying
you did great.
Oh. Yeah.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.000
Yeah, it was...
it was fine, whatever.

28:16.023 --> 28:18.005
You might want to watch it.

28:18.007 --> 28:19.014
- No, I...
- You might want to.

28:21.004 --> 28:22.017
Yeah.

28:22.019 --> 28:25.007
You know, I'm, I'm,
I'm talking to Lisa Arthur.

28:25.009 --> 28:28.001
Oh, great.
Well, yeah, she's famous.

28:28.003 --> 28:30.012
She's the best.
So, what you think?

28:32.021 --> 28:34.016
Can I do this?
Can I win?

28:36.015 --> 28:38.022
- I don't know, Ken.
- No. Right.

28:40.015 --> 28:42.014
Right.

28:48.013 --> 28:50.004
How you feeling?

28:50.006 --> 28:52.016
I'm looking forward
to seeing more of the Balkans.

28:52.018 --> 28:53.022
Mm-hmm.

28:56.012 --> 28:57.018
Is this the worst?

29:00.003 --> 29:03.013
Well, there were
the tabloid suicides.

29:05.014 --> 29:07.020
When we nearly went kablooey
because of Argentina.

29:07.022 --> 29:11.002
I know.
- The Tiananmen Accommodations?

29:12.011 --> 29:14.011
The Black Cloud after Sally Ann?

29:14.013 --> 29:17.009
I remember.
- I don't know.

29:17.011 --> 29:18.022
He's the comeback kid.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.015
No, I know,
I know, I know.

29:20.017 --> 29:24.013
But, Senate, FBI.

29:24.015 --> 29:27.002
SEC, Class Actions.

29:27.004 --> 29:28.023
Plus Sandy and Stewy?

29:29.001 --> 29:32.016
I mean, this is a 12-foot sub
of poisonous tree frogs.

29:32.018 --> 29:37.011
This is the full Baskin-Robbins
31 flavors of fucker
right there.

29:38.013 --> 29:39.013
Gentlemen?

29:42.019 --> 29:45.002
Excuse me, do you mind?
Thank you.

29:49.008 --> 29:51.007
So, this is where I'm landing.

29:51.009 --> 29:55.006
For Waystar, three white shoe
firms on retainers.

29:55.008 --> 29:58.022
Then the next best five,
let's play footsie.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.008
See if we can tie them up
with conflicts.

30:01.010 --> 30:05.019
You two, touch base with Senate
and House surrogates,

30:05.021 --> 30:07.017
payroll commentators,
and friends.

30:07.019 --> 30:11.006
I want everyone lawyered up.

30:11.008 --> 30:16.002
Tom, me to see editorial on
anything on this across ATN

30:16.004 --> 30:18.010
and global cable
and print outlets.

30:18.012 --> 30:21.002
We pressure-point other
operations, the line is,

30:21.004 --> 30:23.022
"Don't lean on this,
it's as bendy as fuck.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.008
Play it smart today,
you won't look a cunt tomorrow."

30:27.010 --> 30:30.004
Karl, I need to talk to the top
12 shareholders

30:30.006 --> 30:31.016
in the next 30 minutes.

30:31.018 --> 30:33.011
An emergency board meeting ASAP

30:33.013 --> 30:36.017
and they'll be rolling through
'til next week, okay?

30:36.019 --> 30:40.010
Hugo, I imagine most of that
is obvious and in train, right?

30:40.012 --> 30:42.015
Largely in hand.

30:42.017 --> 30:45.006
Great. And in terms
of cooperation...

30:45.008 --> 30:46.013
It's war!

30:47.020 --> 30:49.001
Fuck off!

30:50.010 --> 30:52.021
It's war. Fuck off.

30:52.023 --> 30:54.005
- Good?
- Good.

30:55.012 --> 30:56.014
- Good?
- Good.

30:56.016 --> 31:02.008
- Yeah.
- But we throw them this.

31:03.019 --> 31:05.022
I'll step back as CEO.

31:08.020 --> 31:10.002
- Wha--
- You sure?

31:10.004 --> 31:12.017
Well, obviously,
on operational matters

31:12.019 --> 31:16.004
I will expect to have,
um, informal input.

31:18.010 --> 31:22.023
So, as I step back,
uh, temporarily,

31:24.003 --> 31:25.022
who do we like as CEO?

31:30.003 --> 31:31.008
I don't give a fuck.

31:32.005 --> 31:33.018
Its name plates.

31:33.020 --> 31:36.008
Come on. Brain dump.

31:36.010 --> 31:39.006
Speak.
Let a hundred flowers bloom!

31:39.008 --> 31:40.011
No come-backs.

31:40.013 --> 31:44.003
Well, I have to say,
uh, I look good.

31:44.005 --> 31:47.005
- What? What? Why not? I like me.

31:47.007 --> 31:50.000
- Just the fresh face
we're looking for.
Oh, fuck off, Frank.

31:50.002 --> 31:52.003
Karl, if your hands are clean

31:52.005 --> 31:55.007
it's only because your
whorehouse also does manicures.

31:55.009 --> 31:58.018
I mean, I imagine you're
looking at a kid. Or Gerri?

31:58.020 --> 32:02.005
But if you want--if you want
someone short term...

32:02.007 --> 32:04.004
- Frank?
...who knows
the place inside out, I--

32:04.006 --> 32:06.013
You're not trusted.

32:06.015 --> 32:09.016
- You're mashed potatoes.
- Okay, mm-hmm. I get it. Yep.

32:09.018 --> 32:15.003
Now, I'd like a kid, obviously.
So, Shiv or Roman.

32:15.005 --> 32:18.002
But we'd love a woman.
So, Shiv or Gerri.

32:18.004 --> 32:21.023
But I'd like experience.
So, Roman...

32:22.016 --> 32:23.022
or Gerri.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.019
- Just gonna run to the bathroom.
Uh-huh.

32:31.009 --> 32:33.006
A woman is--
a woman is good.

32:38.005 --> 32:40.008
- Hello?
- Hey, listen. They're playing

32:40.010 --> 32:42.020
fucking dice
with God next door, okay?

32:42.022 --> 32:45.010
He is picking a new CEO
in real time.

32:45.012 --> 32:48.003
Oh, okay.
Let me just check that.

32:48.015 --> 32:49.017
One second.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.020
- What? Interim?
<i>Sure, sure.</i>

32:54.022 --> 32:58.021
But you know,
who knows how long it will last?
VW took, like, 5 years, right?

32:58.023 --> 33:01.015
- Wal-Mart took a decade.
- And what's the temperature?

33:01.017 --> 33:03.000
Oh, it's, you know,
it's free form.

33:03.002 --> 33:04.012
"Let a hundred flowers bloom."

33:04.014 --> 33:06.018
Oh, yeah, right! Sure!

33:08.006 --> 33:09.007
Uh...

33:10.014 --> 33:12.022
So listen, do you want it?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.004
Me? What?

33:14.006 --> 33:16.007
No. You crazy, Shiv?
I don't think that's even--

33:16.009 --> 33:17.018
I don't think with the hearings
and cruises--

33:17.020 --> 33:20.018
I don't think it's--I don't,
I don't--I think, no, I mean.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.004
<i>-No.</i>
- So, you're okay to push me?

33:22.006 --> 33:23.015
Well, sure.
That's what I wanted to know.

33:23.017 --> 33:26.002
Because he's gonna fight,
he says.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.001
You wanna be the face of that?

33:33.012 --> 33:35.018
Yeah, I mean, you can get
too fucking clever with this,

33:35.020 --> 33:37.009
- can't you?

33:37.011 --> 33:40.014
Have a problem in there,
buddy? Can't find a vein?

33:40.016 --> 33:42.016
Hold on. Watch it, fuckhead!

33:44.017 --> 33:47.009
Okay, I gotta go. But, um,
if it's going, you want it?

33:47.011 --> 33:49.020
I don't wanna be buried
like Miss Haversham
with a fucking bonnet

33:49.022 --> 33:54.001
full of clever stratagems.
So, yeah! Yes. Yes, I want it.

33:54.003 --> 33:56.002
You get in there
and you hustle, baby. Hustle!

33:57.001 --> 33:58.005
Okay.

34:07.005 --> 34:08.019
- Interesting call?
- What?

34:09.019 --> 34:12.004
Ah, no. Just--just bullshit.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.017
Oh. Just bullshit?
That's boring.

34:16.007 --> 34:19.003
Ugh!
I hate boring shit, don't you?

34:19.005 --> 34:21.006
- What?
Just, you know,
boring phone calls

34:21.008 --> 34:24.014
about bullshit. It's just
so boring, right, Shiv?

34:24.016 --> 34:25.018
It's boring?

34:25.020 --> 34:27.018
Because Gerri just heard
from Frank

34:27.020 --> 34:30.020
and Dad is apparently
live picking the new CEO.

34:30.022 --> 34:33.007
Oh, Okay.

34:33.009 --> 34:36.000
Oh. "Oh, okay." So, Tom didn't
just mention that to you?

34:36.002 --> 34:37.018
Oh, yeah,
now that you mention it,

34:37.020 --> 34:41.002
- he, maybe he did, yeah. Mm-hmm.
-"Yeah, okay, maybe."
Fuck you. Fuck you.

34:41.004 --> 34:43.006
So, how come Frank called you
and how come you told him?

34:43.008 --> 34:45.006
I'm just a very straightforward
person, Shiv.

34:45.008 --> 34:47.010
Oh, yeah? So, what'd you hear?

34:47.012 --> 34:50.005
Well, I heard there's a number
of names in contention.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.023
All right!
Care to make it interesting?

34:53.001 --> 34:54.012
Throw a little money
on the table?

34:54.014 --> 34:56.016
Well, I'm already
pretty fucking interested.

34:56.018 --> 34:58.006
So, I think I'm good.

34:59.010 --> 35:00.021
Yeah, a full tally would be--

35:00.023 --> 35:03.015
would be great, thank you.
Yep. I can hold.

35:12.001 --> 35:13.019
Hi, uh...

35:13.021 --> 35:16.019
Kinda just wanna let you know,
I was doing his media monitoring

35:16.021 --> 35:18.013
for a while, but I guess...

35:18.015 --> 35:20.005
Oh...
-...you'll be taking that over?

35:20.007 --> 35:21.020
Yeah, that would be us.

35:21.022 --> 35:24.007
Yeah, I wrote down
a lot of tweets,

35:24.009 --> 35:27.008
like relevant tweets that felt
kind of important so I could--

35:27.010 --> 35:30.009
- Is that useful to pass on? Or--
- We can find them.

35:30.011 --> 35:33.009
- They're on Twitter?
- Yeah. They are all on--
They're all on Twitter.

35:33.011 --> 35:34.020
- Yeah.
- But thank you.

35:34.022 --> 35:36.017
No worries. Here to help.

35:37.013 --> 35:39.001
I'm on hold over here.

35:40.009 --> 35:41.021
Cancelling my mom's credit card.

35:41.023 --> 35:44.003
Okay. Nice.

35:45.012 --> 35:48.008
Yeah, no.
It's pretty stupid actually.

35:48.010 --> 35:51.009
Uh, my grandpa cut her off.

35:51.011 --> 35:53.022
Uh, long story.
I guaranteed her gold card,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.022
just 'cause I thought that'd be,
like, a good son thing to do?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.016
And then just she saw
the press conference,

35:58.018 --> 36:00.007
and she's kind of, like,

36:00.009 --> 36:03.005
under the impression that
Ken's taking the company down.

36:03.007 --> 36:05.022
And so she's over here
panic buying NutriBullets

36:06.000 --> 36:10.012
and buying a lot of Krugerrands.
Like a very particular currency.

36:10.014 --> 36:12.006
And she never even drinks
the smoothies--

36:12.008 --> 36:14.014
Hey!
- So, it's like...

36:14.016 --> 36:18.007
Berry fucking Schneider
in the house!

36:18.009 --> 36:20.002
Thanks for coming.
How you doing?

36:20.004 --> 36:22.015
- Great. Good to see you.
- Yeah? Come on in. Come on in.
Let's sit, let's sit.

36:22.017 --> 36:24.010
- Thanks for having us. Comfry.
Hey, I'm Kendall.

36:24.012 --> 36:26.000
- Is he harassing you?
- No, he's fine.

36:26.002 --> 36:27.014
Greg, stay here.

36:27.016 --> 36:30.021
Welcome to my ex-wife's
living room. Sit, sit.

36:34.013 --> 36:38.007
Can we just say, right off,
some jobs are money jobs,

36:38.009 --> 36:40.006
some are heart jobs.

36:40.008 --> 36:43.007
We would love to work with you.
We love the narrative arc.

36:43.009 --> 36:44.015
We love everything you did.

36:44.017 --> 36:46.003
And I would love
to work with you,

36:46.005 --> 36:49.000
but, uh, if it's cool,
and I know you guys are the best

36:49.002 --> 36:51.010
but is it okay
if this is still a pitch?

36:51.012 --> 36:52.017
- Of course!
Great.

36:52.019 --> 36:55.010
- So, we have a lot of thoughts.
Yeah.

36:55.012 --> 36:58.004
Communication planning
and positioning thoughts.

36:58.006 --> 37:00.004
How we can leverage
our relationships

37:00.006 --> 37:03.014
- with significant writers
at major outlets.
- Yes. Yes.

37:03.016 --> 37:05.011
Prepare to prime and amplify

37:05.013 --> 37:08.017
- some impressive secondaries.
- Great, great. So, shall,
shall I talk, or will you?

37:08.019 --> 37:09.023
Well, we want to hear
your thoughts,

37:10.001 --> 37:11.020
of course,
but you wanna start off

37:11.022 --> 37:14.010
- just hearing our five points?
- Sure. Sure, you go.

37:14.012 --> 37:16.002
<i>Okay. So--</i>
- But I think
the headline needs to be

37:16.004 --> 37:18.013
"Fuck the weather, we're
changing the cultural climate."

37:20.003 --> 37:21.013
- But you go.
- Okay, I mean...

37:21.015 --> 37:25.019
For context, I, I, I'm talking
to the <i>Times</i> <i>about an op-ed.</i>

37:25.021 --> 37:28.001
Draft an alternative corporate
manifesto.

37:28.003 --> 37:32.000
Drop a rapid reaction TEDx.
Shit like that.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.007
Well, that's great.

37:33.009 --> 37:35.000
It's cheesy as fuck
but, you know,

37:35.002 --> 37:37.008
I need people to see this was
part of a coherent philosophy,

37:37.010 --> 37:39.007
not just punching an old guy
in the fucking nose?

37:39.009 --> 37:42.015
- Yeah?
- Right. Right. That's in line
with our thoughts. So--

37:42.017 --> 37:45.009
Well, I just, I may as well say,
on a dumb level,

37:45.011 --> 37:47.005
I'd like my Twitter
to be off the hook.

37:47.007 --> 37:50.008
This could all get
super earnest, so I was thinking
of hitting up some BoJack guys.

37:50.010 --> 37:53.001
You know? Some, some,
some of the Lampoon kids...

37:53.003 --> 37:55.022
to just smash that shit,
make my feed a little powder keg

37:56.000 --> 37:57.003
people need to check-in with?

37:57.005 --> 37:58.020
Like cool tweets
that position you?

37:58.022 --> 38:00.005
Yeah, that would be the...

38:00.007 --> 38:03.002
straight-leg chino way
of putting it. "Cool tweets."

38:03.004 --> 38:05.020
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!

38:05.022 --> 38:08.014
No, it's--I'm kidding.
I know you guys are the best.

38:08.016 --> 38:11.001
Okay, sorry.
I want to work with you

38:11.003 --> 38:13.011
if you can...
if you can work with me?

38:14.008 --> 38:15.013
Sure.

38:15.015 --> 38:20.000
Well, we think you're going
to win this and we like winners!

Hello.
Hi, uh, Waystar Royco?

39:12.005 --> 39:14.022
- Gerri is clean, right?
- Well, I mean. Up to a point?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.019
Oh, she was nowhere near cruises
was she, when... you know?

39:17.021 --> 39:21.011
She was in the UK on all
that regulatory shit, I think,
during the time in question.

39:21.013 --> 39:24.000
I have to say, I like Gerri.

39:26.009 --> 39:30.001
Oh! You like Gerri?

39:30.003 --> 39:32.013
Uh-huh. I do.

39:32.015 --> 39:35.007
Are you playing
the reverse banjo, son?

39:35.009 --> 39:39.023
- Trying to black spot her?
- Nope. No. I do.

39:40.001 --> 39:43.004
She's very stolid.
And I like Roman.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.007
Oh, you like Roman?

39:48.005 --> 39:51.017
- What about yourself, Tom?
- Who, me? What?

39:51.019 --> 39:53.023
Oh, you know.
You're kind of family.

39:54.001 --> 39:55.007
Kind of new blood.

39:55.009 --> 39:57.018
Well, that's very kind.
But I don't--no. I don't...

39:57.020 --> 40:01.008
I think it's a little rich
for my blood just yet. So...

40:02.009 --> 40:04.010
- What about Shiv?
- Well, Shiv's great.

40:04.023 --> 40:06.004
Uh-huh.

40:06.006 --> 40:09.015
I like Shiv. But no experience.
And Roman, great, but...

40:09.017 --> 40:11.020
- You don't think Roman is ready?
- Do you?

40:11.022 --> 40:13.010
Well, is anybody ready?

40:13.012 --> 40:15.013
- Was I ready?
- So...

40:15.015 --> 40:18.002
When he's not all fucking
"meh, meh, meh"...

40:18.004 --> 40:21.002
Plus, I'll be pulling
the strings. Right?

40:23.015 --> 40:25.017
- I like Roman.

40:25.019 --> 40:26.022
Of course I like Roman.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.012
Sure you do! He'll fucking
fire you on day one!

40:35.001 --> 40:36.012
Oh, Romulus.

40:36.014 --> 40:40.003
Hey, Dad. Um... can I just speak
to you for a moment?

40:40.012 --> 40:41.016
Sure.

40:41.018 --> 40:46.004
Well, um, it's already getting
out what you're thinking about

40:46.006 --> 40:49.019
so, um, I just wanted to throw
a couple of things

40:49.021 --> 40:53.011
- in the old, uh, lobster pot.
- Mm-hmm.

40:55.016 --> 40:56.021
I think it should be me.

40:58.021 --> 41:01.019
- Okay.
- It's my time.

41:01.021 --> 41:05.008
I can do it, I want it,
and I think I can do it. So...

41:10.004 --> 41:13.007
- Um... But, I... Sorry, what?
- Okay, um--

41:13.009 --> 41:14.023
No, no. You go.

41:15.001 --> 41:16.008
Yeah, okay. Well...

41:17.010 --> 41:19.000
I think it should be me.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.017
But...

41:21.019 --> 41:25.015
If you don't think I'm ready,
okay, which, um...

41:27.001 --> 41:30.000
<i>um, I would understand.</i>

41:30.002 --> 41:32.006
But--and I'm not saying
that I agree with that,

41:32.008 --> 41:33.013
but, you know, um...

41:34.022 --> 41:39.013
maybe a couple of years under
the wing of an older, uh... hen,

41:39.015 --> 41:43.008
could, you know, see me crack
out of the old egg.

41:43.010 --> 41:45.018
<i>And, um, I gotta, I gotta say,</i>

41:45.020 --> 41:48.014
I know that you've been sweet
on Shiv,

41:48.016 --> 41:51.015
and I love her, like a brother.

41:51.017 --> 41:56.019
But, um, I just don't think
that it's time, you know?

41:56.021 --> 41:58.010
And all bitterness aside,

41:58.012 --> 42:01.012
I do wonder
if maybe it isn't Gerri time.

42:01.014 --> 42:04.018
<i>So I would think just, you know,
let the stone-cold bitch do it.</i>

42:04.020 --> 42:07.023
<i>She's tough,
she's got the good chromosomes.</i>

42:08.001 --> 42:10.020
For whatever reason,
it ain't Romey time, then, uh...

42:10.022 --> 42:12.008
maybe it's crony time.

42:14.012 --> 42:16.007
Mm-hmm.

42:16.009 --> 42:19.011
I hope I haven't, um,
I don't know, overstepped here.

42:20.015 --> 42:23.004
Nope. Thank you, son.

42:25.001 --> 42:29.002
Okay, well, um, I'd love it,
but, you know, I understand.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.007
But I do want it. Okay?

42:31.009 --> 42:34.006
But, you know?
No hard feelings, so, um...

42:35.021 --> 42:38.017
Uh yeah, no, anyway, I'm just...

42:38.019 --> 42:40.020
So, uh, uh yeah, love you, Dad.

42:40.022 --> 42:42.014
- Uh-huh,
<i>Bye.</i>

42:44.008 --> 42:45.010
Roman's out.

42:49.021 --> 42:51.011
He's out. Okay?

43:10.002 --> 43:11.020
- Who is it? Is it him?
- Hey.

43:13.001 --> 43:14.002
Uh-huh.

43:16.016 --> 43:18.003
Yeah, yeah, of course.

43:21.006 --> 43:25.010
Thanks, Dad. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Sure, I can do that.

43:27.015 --> 43:29.000
I can do it.

43:32.017 --> 43:34.007
What? You can do what?

43:35.012 --> 43:39.000
Oh, fuck. Fuck, go on.

43:39.002 --> 43:41.013
- He wants me to go get Lisa.
- You're a fucking bitch.

43:41.015 --> 43:44.000
He told me to tell you
to wait airport adjacent though,

43:44.002 --> 43:45.015
he might need someone
on investors. You might need

43:45.017 --> 43:47.007
to fly to Boston
to meet Arenson.

43:47.009 --> 43:50.013
Or, you know, hijack a plane
and fly him to Cuba.

43:50.015 --> 43:53.023
And he didn't say anything
about CEO?

43:54.001 --> 43:57.009
Oh. Oh, yeah. No, sorry, he did.
It's me.

44:00.006 --> 44:02.011
Oh. Oh! You got me.

44:02.013 --> 44:05.010
Oh, you really fooled me, Shiv.

44:05.019 --> 44:06.021
Hilarious.

44:37.013 --> 44:40.015
We've gone
over that, so now,
what's the solution?

44:42.002 --> 44:44.001
Okay.
Well, when is that happening?

44:44.003 --> 44:46.002
Eminently.
Okay, good.

44:47.006 --> 44:49.000
Can I have the room, please?

44:55.010 --> 44:57.006
Hey.
Hey, Shiv.

44:57.008 --> 44:59.021
Lisa! How are you?

44:59.023 --> 45:01.009
- Good.
- God, look at you!

45:01.011 --> 45:03.008
- It's been so long. This place--
- Sit, sit.

45:03.010 --> 45:04.015
Wow, it's amazing.

45:05.006 --> 45:07.001
Thank you.

45:07.003 --> 45:11.007
So, um... So listen.
I'm just gonna jump right in

45:11.009 --> 45:13.021
because I don't want this
to be difficult with a friend.

45:13.023 --> 45:16.013
Um, and I hope I've not wasted
your time because...

45:16.015 --> 45:18.011
Yeah, no,
the message came through.

45:18.013 --> 45:20.011
- You can't act for my dad.
- Right.

45:21.007 --> 45:23.003
I don't think I fit, so...

45:23.016 --> 45:25.005
Yeah. Uh...

45:25.007 --> 45:27.021
So, cards on the table, I wanted
to talk to you

45:27.023 --> 45:32.015
- about something else.
- Oh. Okay.

45:32.017 --> 45:34.021
Mm-hmm. I'm, uh...

45:36.006 --> 45:38.013
Yeah, I'm thinking about
my own position here.

45:38.015 --> 45:41.022
And to be honest,
I could do with a friend.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.018
A discreet friend
with legal training.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.022
You know, a consigliere.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.009
A smart, savvy woman,
who can help me navigate

45:50.011 --> 45:52.002
the position I find myself in.

45:52.004 --> 45:55.009
Right, that's kind.

45:55.011 --> 45:57.016
But that's not the kind of role
I normally take on.

45:57.018 --> 45:59.004
I know, I know, but, uh,

45:59.006 --> 46:02.002
honestly, Lis, I got
nowhere to fucking turn here.

46:02.004 --> 46:04.000
You know my husband
is a player in this.

46:04.002 --> 46:05.019
And, uh, in one world,

46:05.021 --> 46:08.019
there's, uh, I'm in a position
to come out here as CEO.

46:08.021 --> 46:13.004
Or I might have to leave the
firm to protect my reputation.

46:13.006 --> 46:15.002
You know, I don't know
what my dad did,
and I don't know

46:15.004 --> 46:17.017
what my brother did,
and I don't know
what the firm did.

46:17.019 --> 46:21.005
I'm in a fucking
fuck pie here, Lisa.

46:21.007 --> 46:23.007
Can I clean it up?
I don't know.

46:23.009 --> 46:25.007
I don't know. I have a plan...

46:25.009 --> 46:27.023
but I could easily get crushed
between these two fucking men,

46:28.001 --> 46:30.012
and I need to game things out,
and I need to do that

46:30.014 --> 46:32.009
with someone
who can give me a read
legally and culturally

46:32.011 --> 46:34.012
- and politically and socially,
and, you know, it's a lot.
- Okay, look. Okay, look.

46:34.014 --> 46:36.021
- And I trust you and...
- Look, look, stop. Stop, Shiv.

46:38.015 --> 46:40.001
I can't give you legal advice

46:40.003 --> 46:42.015
and you should not give me
any confidential information.

46:42.017 --> 46:44.007
- Okay?
- Okay.

46:44.009 --> 46:46.015
Uh, fuck. Uh...

46:50.003 --> 46:51.018
I'm sorry. Is that--Does...

46:52.015 --> 46:54.008
Does that mean
what I think it means?

46:55.015 --> 46:57.014
- Are we done?
- Yeah, you know what?

46:57.016 --> 46:59.018
I would, I would just say...

46:59.020 --> 47:01.023
careful who you hitch
your wagon to, honey,

47:02.001 --> 47:04.004
'cause a lot of wagons
are going in the ditch.

47:04.006 --> 47:06.004
Right. Thanks, "honey."

47:06.006 --> 47:07.016
You know, you'd actually
consider working with that

47:07.018 --> 47:10.014
disingenuous little fuck doll?
He's not on the level, Lis.

47:10.016 --> 47:13.005
Shiv,
I am unavailable to help you.

47:13.007 --> 47:16.003
If for some reason that changes,
I'll let you know.

47:16.015 --> 47:18.009
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:18.011 --> 47:21.007
Wow. Well, thanks, pal.

47:48.007 --> 47:50.017
- Any vibes?
- On what?

47:50.019 --> 47:52.009
"On what?" On the whole,

47:52.011 --> 47:54.013
"Is my dad going to jail?"
situation,

47:54.015 --> 47:57.018
who's climbing Mount Olympus
to be the new Dr. Zeus.

48:02.023 --> 48:05.015
Look at us here. Waiting.

48:06.015 --> 48:10.003
So fucking... hot.

48:11.004 --> 48:12.021
If it's you,
you think you're clean?

48:12.023 --> 48:14.021
Yeah, obviously.
There's a bed through here

48:14.023 --> 48:16.011
if you wanna give it a go.

48:16.013 --> 48:18.020
The pipeline was still sending
cruise girls out west

48:18.022 --> 48:20.002
when you were
in L.A. though, right?

48:20.004 --> 48:22.003
Yeah, that was... mostly over.

48:22.005 --> 48:23.018
There's deniability,
Frank thinks.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.011
We essentially
didn't even actually know.

48:25.013 --> 48:28.023
That's all on the...
the little guys and Mo.

48:29.001 --> 48:30.016
Uh-huh.

48:30.018 --> 48:33.022
What about the satellite launch,
accelerating it?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.018
I'd lay you badly,
but I'd lay you gladly.

48:36.020 --> 48:39.005
Can I remind you, Roman,
that so far as I am concerned

48:39.007 --> 48:41.004
nothing has ever happened
between us

48:41.006 --> 48:42.016
other than
of a professional nature.

48:42.018 --> 48:45.008
Mm-hmm. Gotta be curious though,
right?

48:45.010 --> 48:47.004
Young fighter in his prime.

48:47.006 --> 48:49.012
Technically raw,
but, you know, hungry.

48:49.014 --> 48:51.016
I am quite a successful person,
Roman,

48:51.018 --> 48:55.016
and I remain so
by avoiding mess.

48:55.018 --> 49:00.009
Mm-hmm. Well, we're stuck
in this room for...

49:01.011 --> 49:03.011
I don't even know how long.
And, um...

49:04.022 --> 49:06.006
no one would know.

49:09.019 --> 49:12.013
Hey, Logan. Okay.

49:14.014 --> 49:15.014
Great.

49:17.003 --> 49:21.004
Okay, uh, well, um...
Okay. well...

49:22.008 --> 49:24.003
Yes, yes.

49:25.021 --> 49:28.008
Sure, I'll let him know.
I'll tell him.

49:30.009 --> 49:31.012
Thank you.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.007
- So?
- It's me.

49:36.003 --> 49:37.017
- Are you kidding?
- It's me.

49:37.019 --> 49:39.005
- Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding.

49:39.007 --> 49:42.000
- It's actually you?
- It's me.
Shiv blew it with Lisa.

49:42.018 --> 49:44.015
Okay.

49:44.017 --> 49:47.008
Shit a pony. So, what,
you're like the boss of me now?

49:47.010 --> 49:50.023
- Well...
- Congratulations, Gerri.
That's, uh...

49:51.001 --> 49:52.021
Yeah, that's great.
Congratulations.

49:52.023 --> 49:54.002
You fucking bitch.

49:54.004 --> 49:56.019
It's just an administrative
position, largely, so--

49:56.021 --> 49:59.010
You know, I might have swung
this for you, you know that?

49:59.012 --> 50:00.014
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

50:01.014 --> 50:02.015
Does Shiv know?

50:03.020 --> 50:06.001
Can I tell her?
I--I think I should tell her.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.022
I think it'd be nicer
coming from me.

50:11.023 --> 50:13.016
- Yeah?
- Hey, yeah.

50:13.018 --> 50:16.014
So, we lost Lisa?
I guess you fucked it?

50:16.016 --> 50:17.021
Your friend doesn't like you?

50:17.023 --> 50:20.008
<i>Oh, also Gerri got the job.
He wanted me to tell you.</i>

50:20.010 --> 50:22.016
But I got a song for you.
It goes...

50:22.018 --> 50:25.013
♪ <i>Your friend doesn't like you
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo</i> <i>♪</i>

50:25.015 --> 50:28.022
♪ <i>And Dad wants to fire you
woo-hoo, woo...</i> <i>♪</i>

50:29.000 --> 50:30.011
♪ <i>And you hung up!</i> <i>♪</i>

50:34.011 --> 50:36.022
You know what?
Change of plan.

50:48.005 --> 50:50.011
- Hey, Rav? Rav?
Yeah.

50:50.013 --> 50:53.002
- Hey, I got more folks incoming.
- Yeah, yeah.

50:53.004 --> 50:55.007
And, and also just, um...

50:55.009 --> 50:58.019
as an FYI, is it cool if
Naomi Pierce comes up?

50:58.021 --> 51:01.003
- Sure, is she the Pierce...
- She's the...

51:01.005 --> 51:03.003
Yeah, you know, we have
a little thing...

51:03.005 --> 51:05.003
- Yeah, yeah. Fine. I heard.
...going.

51:05.005 --> 51:08.000
It's not weird?
She, she's kind of good for me.

51:08.002 --> 51:11.006
- No, sure. Yeah.
Thank you.

51:12.004 --> 51:14.014
- Look at us, huh? Huh?
- I know.

51:16.010 --> 51:19.005
Also, I saw the razors, so...

51:19.007 --> 51:22.002
- What?
- The razors in your bathroom?

51:22.004 --> 51:24.007
- Whose are those?
- Wait--wh--

51:24.009 --> 51:25.014
Why were you in my bathroom?

51:25.016 --> 51:28.005
Because I don't like to drop
a deuce where the staff go.

51:28.007 --> 51:32.004
Yeah. Oh, God. Ken,
uh, those don't actually mean...

51:32.006 --> 51:35.009
- Oh, no? Male razors?
- What... no!

51:35.011 --> 51:37.014
Uh, they're less expensive.

51:37.016 --> 51:39.009
Oh, so I'm not giving you
enough money

51:39.011 --> 51:41.003
for gender-appropriate razors
now?

51:41.005 --> 51:43.002
Ken, I'm not having this
conversation right now.

51:43.004 --> 51:44.007
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

51:44.009 --> 51:46.000
- This isn't that conversation.
It's funny. Good.

51:46.002 --> 51:47.008
- Hey, Ken.
- Yeah?

51:47.010 --> 51:48.023
Uh, Lisa and Keith are here.

51:49.001 --> 51:51.008
Hey, Ken.
- Hey, hey, Team Genius!

51:51.010 --> 51:53.010
- Thank you for coming.
- My pleasure.

51:53.012 --> 51:56.011
Keith, Kendall.
Please sit.

51:56.013 --> 51:58.004
Uh, can I,
can I get you anything?

51:58.006 --> 52:00.011
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're good? You sure?

52:00.013 --> 52:02.019
Rav, it'll just be
four or five hours.

52:02.021 --> 52:05.020
- Uh, yeah, fine.
- Okay, hey. Here she is.

52:05.022 --> 52:07.010
- Hi.
- Hello.

52:07.012 --> 52:09.005
Look what the Aegean dragged in.

52:11.007 --> 52:13.022
Okay, I'm right in the middle--
So, I want to introduce you.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.006
This is Rava. Rava, Naomi.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.017
Hey. Hi.

52:18.019 --> 52:20.015
So good to meet you.

52:20.017 --> 52:23.001
And thank you for this.

52:23.003 --> 52:25.023
Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, not at all.

52:26.022 --> 52:28.006
I just gotta--I gotta...

52:28.008 --> 52:30.013
Me too. Hey, Greg,
can you help, uh...
Yeah?

52:30.015 --> 52:33.022
-...Naomi, I gotta... Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

52:34.011 --> 52:35.017
So...

52:35.019 --> 52:39.009
He's still in Europe.
He's scared.

52:39.011 --> 52:43.007
And it looks like
my dad's gone to Sarajevo.

52:43.009 --> 52:46.008
Okay. So, I should, um,
make it clear

52:46.010 --> 52:48.008
this is just a preliminary.

52:48.010 --> 52:49.019
So, no confidential information.

52:49.021 --> 52:52.010
Sure. Sure. Well, look,
what can I tell you?

52:52.012 --> 52:55.003
Uh... my dad's the devil.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.017
He runs a crime ring,
and I would love to hire you

52:57.019 --> 52:59.000
because you're a super star

52:59.002 --> 53:00.014
and I think you can take down
my dad,

53:00.016 --> 53:02.002
and this will be the case
of the century

53:02.004 --> 53:05.000
- and the highlight
of your career.
- Okay. Okay.

53:05.002 --> 53:06.018
- Well, that might be--
I'm serious.

53:06.020 --> 53:08.009
They'll make a movie about you.

53:08.011 --> 53:09.016
We should make a movie
about you.

53:09.018 --> 53:11.003
Mm-hmm. And how would that look?

53:11.005 --> 53:13.018
It would look amazing,
because it would be brilliant!

53:13.020 --> 53:17.007
Okay, look, this is quite
a complex situation to progress

53:17.009 --> 53:19.021
because, as I understand it,
you want to take down your dad

53:19.023 --> 53:22.005
- without implicating yourself?
- Correct.

53:22.007 --> 53:23.022
And without damaging
the company to the extent

53:24.000 --> 53:27.002
that you lose control
at your shareholder meeting?

53:27.004 --> 53:31.019
- Correct.
- And you know that Shiv and I
have had a friend relationship?

53:31.021 --> 53:33.019
Yeah, well, that might
work out anyway.

53:33.021 --> 53:36.015
Okay, well, that's for you two,
but first things.

53:36.017 --> 53:39.003
Has the government reached out
to you yet?

53:39.005 --> 53:41.023
Or have you received a subpoena
for the documents yet?

53:42.001 --> 53:43.010
No, no. And look, to be clear,

53:43.012 --> 53:45.016
I will do whatever you tell me
to do.

53:46.012 --> 53:47.019
I am your puppet.

53:47.021 --> 53:49.019
Okay. Well, in the first
instance, we need to make sure

53:49.021 --> 53:52.022
you're in the clear
with your friends
at one, Saint Andrew's.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.014
- Right.
So, first thing is
to make sure

53:54.016 --> 53:57.010
your head isn't on the block,
okay, puppet?

53:57.012 --> 53:59.012
Lisa, I feel like
you're my lawyer!

53:59.014 --> 54:03.015
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Greg! What the fuck?

54:03.017 --> 54:04.020
- Be right back.
- Ken!

54:04.022 --> 54:06.006
- Jess, can you...
- Yep.

54:06.008 --> 54:07.010
Ken!

54:07.012 --> 54:09.022
I'm so sorry.
Yeah. I'm right here.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.011
I'm sorry, did you not
see that there was dust all over
the bottle?

54:12.013 --> 54:13.022
- We okay?
Did you not think to--

54:14.001 --> 54:16.016
- No, it's fine.
- I really had no--
I'm really sorry, Rava.

54:16.018 --> 54:19.014
It is fine.
- What?

54:19.016 --> 54:22.000
That was one
my godfather gave me.

54:22.002 --> 54:23.012
Naomi told me to open it, Ken.

54:23.014 --> 54:24.016
- Oh.
- And so I just...

54:24.018 --> 54:26.017
- Well, I'm very sorry, Rava.
- I'm so sorry.

54:26.019 --> 54:28.000
Greg, that's not...
- Hi.

54:28.002 --> 54:31.001
- Hey.
- Hey, ooh, sorry.

54:31.003 --> 54:33.011
No, no, no.
Guys, drink it, enjoy it.

54:33.013 --> 54:36.001
I don't want any
personally--
- It's fine! It's good.

54:36.003 --> 54:38.015
It's like when someone breaks
something beautiful

54:38.017 --> 54:41.004
and it reminds you
that nothing lasts.

54:42.021 --> 54:43.021
Enjoy it.

54:45.019 --> 54:49.002
I'll get some napkins.

54:54.013 --> 54:56.022
All these brilliant
fucking women, Greg.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.007
- I mean...
- Hey, I must be doing
something right.

55:00.004 --> 55:01.015
- Right? Right?
- You are.

55:01.017 --> 55:03.007
You're doing everything right,
man.

55:03.009 --> 55:05.003
You are on top of the world.

55:05.005 --> 55:07.023
Okay. Uh, I'll be back
in a flash.

55:08.001 --> 55:11.018
All right, baby. Lisa Arthur,
you got my undivided attention.

55:11.020 --> 55:14.005
Where's Shiv?
- I'm trying.

55:14.007 --> 55:16.018
Looks like the Gerri CEO
news might have leaked.

55:17.023 --> 55:21.011
- And I got Simon
on the board lined up.
Uh-huh.

55:21.013 --> 55:24.007
- Do you want a room?
- Yes, I want a fucking room!

55:24.009 --> 55:26.014
I'm about to eat dick for three
hours straight,

55:26.016 --> 55:30.013
so, yes, Hugo,
I would like a fucking room.

55:30.015 --> 55:34.007
Okay...

55:34.009 --> 55:35.013
I don't need that.

55:38.018 --> 55:39.019
Kendall.

55:42.021 --> 55:43.021
Right.

55:46.020 --> 55:48.014
Sure, well, whatever.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.008
- What now?
- Nothing, tell you later.

55:54.010 --> 55:56.023
- Go on, fucking say!
- It's not a big deal.

55:58.013 --> 56:00.014
Lisa Arthur is going
to represent Kendall.

56:02.003 --> 56:03.004
Huh.

56:04.023 --> 56:05.023
Fine.

56:07.009 --> 56:08.009
Fine.

56:09.021 --> 56:10.022
Let's get Layo.

56:12.009 --> 56:14.001
We'll fucking beast 'em.

56:14.003 --> 56:18.002
We'll go full fucking beast!
