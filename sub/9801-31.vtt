00:09.590 --> 00:13.360
NARRATOR: And now, DreamWorks--
The Penguins of Madagascar.

00:52.760 --> 00:57.330
-Gentlemen, we are a go ho ho.

00:57.330 --> 00:58.800
-I can't believe it's here!

01:01.890 --> 01:03.390
-All right, people.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.320
Time to jangle the jingles
and criss the cringles.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.700
We are T minus 14
hours to Kidsmas.

01:12.580 --> 01:16.260
-Mr. Skipper penguin, is
the Kidsmas really here?

01:16.260 --> 01:18.020
-You bet your downy derriere.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.580
-But not till morning.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.660
-So skedaddle those eager
britches on home now.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.860
No peeking.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.870
-Excuse me.

01:26.870 --> 01:27.770
Hi.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.860
So Kidsmas, I'm confused.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.370
This relates to
Christmas how exactly?

01:32.370 --> 01:35.740
-Kowalski, get the
reptile up to speed.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.190
-Well, Roger, every year,
the Central Park Zoo

01:38.190 --> 01:41.340
closes from Christmas Eve to
the morning of December 26th.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.210
-Also known as Boxing Day.

01:43.210 --> 01:46.930
-We're not interested in your
made up holidays, Private.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.470
-We take advantage of this
human-free environmental

01:49.470 --> 01:53.110
to throw a mondo Christmas
fiesta for the animal families

01:53.110 --> 01:57.440
of Central Park, an
event we like to call--

01:57.440 --> 01:58.740
-Kidsmas!

01:58.740 --> 01:59.530
-Kidsmas!

01:59.530 --> 02:01.740
-Tomorrow morning.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.800
You know the drill, people.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.410
Let's open those
assignment cards.

02:11.830 --> 02:15.960
And let's go make this
the best Kidsmas ever.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.820
-Excuse us.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.760
Royalty coming through.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.460
-Hello.

02:18.460 --> 02:22.670
Who do give a talking at if
my job is stupid and lame?

02:22.670 --> 02:23.430
-Lame?

02:23.430 --> 02:25.290
Children love the
gingerbread house.

02:25.290 --> 02:25.990
-Yes.

02:25.990 --> 02:30.730
They also love finding crusty
things in their own noses.

02:30.730 --> 02:32.460
-Mine had a kazoo.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.950
-I am king.

02:36.950 --> 02:41.480
I demand the most important
of all the Kidsmas tasks.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.900
-Demand denied.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.290
Kidsmas is a well-oiled machine
with years of tradition.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.850
Mason always dresses
up as Zoo Santa.

02:48.850 --> 02:51.660
-Ho ho ho ho ho ho.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.350
-Burt makes his
famous peanut nog.

02:53.350 --> 02:56.940
-The secret
ingredient is peanuts.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.730
-And so on, without swapping
assignments the night

02:59.730 --> 03:01.050
before the big event.

03:01.050 --> 03:01.750
End of story.

03:01.750 --> 03:02.790
-Oh, really?

03:02.790 --> 03:05.310
What happened to the
freedom of changing?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.410
What happened to the
right of the peoples?

03:08.410 --> 03:10.160
I thought this was France.

03:10.160 --> 03:10.860
-America.

03:10.860 --> 03:11.750
-No, really.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.520
I seriously thought
this was France.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.980
I've been looking for
some decent crepes

03:14.980 --> 03:16.200
for like three months.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.940
-Yo, hey, the little
guy's got a point.

03:19.940 --> 03:23.080
-Yeah, I'm sick of doing
the same job every year.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.590
-Yes, the pressure of the
lead role is rather brutal.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.440
-We're on an overnight
deadline, people.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.520
There's no time to--

03:32.520 --> 03:33.220
-Yes.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.810
Let's mixy mix the Kidsmas.

03:35.810 --> 03:36.510
-Hey!

03:41.670 --> 03:43.110
-Hey, music.

03:43.110 --> 03:47.090
That's perfect for me.

03:47.090 --> 03:47.840
-All right!

03:47.840 --> 03:48.540
I'm on decorations!

03:48.540 --> 03:53.830
-[MUMBLES]

03:53.830 --> 03:57.490
-Best committee ever.

03:57.490 --> 03:58.610
-Smashing.

03:58.610 --> 03:59.870
I'm the decorations.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.150
-No way.

04:01.150 --> 04:01.880
Me too.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.830
Look!

04:02.830 --> 04:04.780
-Best committee ever.

04:04.780 --> 04:05.550
-No.

04:05.550 --> 04:06.790
Lame.

04:06.790 --> 04:07.490
Blah.

04:07.490 --> 04:08.930
Double blah.

04:08.930 --> 04:10.440
Yes, yes!

04:10.440 --> 04:13.480
I will find the
Christmasty tree!

04:13.480 --> 04:16.740
Truly, there is no job
more important than--

04:16.740 --> 04:17.530
-Santa!

04:17.530 --> 04:18.230
-What?

04:18.230 --> 04:19.300
Who's playing Santa?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.080
-You are, Skipper.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.710
It's the last one left.

04:21.710 --> 04:23.260
You didn't even
pick, and you got

04:23.260 --> 04:24.670
the most important job of all.

04:24.670 --> 04:26.280
How lucky is that?

04:26.280 --> 04:28.600
-Most important?

04:31.340 --> 04:32.040
-Me?

04:32.040 --> 04:34.050
Playing the Big Red himself?

04:34.050 --> 04:35.570
-And I'm your jolly little elf.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.820
I'm little [MUMBLES].

04:37.820 --> 04:39.400
-Negative!

04:39.400 --> 04:41.540
This is a holiday anarchy.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.560
We go down this road, there
won't even be a Kidsmas.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.350
-No Kidsmas?

04:47.350 --> 04:50.180
-Hey, you weren't
supposed to hear that.

04:50.180 --> 04:57.340
I'm just-- you know what
anarchy is, don't you, kids?

04:57.340 --> 05:04.010
We've got one night,
and-- chins up, soldiers.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.260
I've got it covered.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.980
-We should go total
rock and roll this year.

05:10.980 --> 05:15.500
Like sledgums, and flash packs,
and ski punk snowmen, or like,

05:15.500 --> 05:16.270
what's up.

05:16.270 --> 05:17.490
-Yeah!

05:17.490 --> 05:20.060
-We should go completely
Charles Dickens this year.

05:20.060 --> 05:24.000
-Top hats, monacles,
umimpeachable etiquette.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.640
-Kids love etiquette.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.450
-See?

05:27.450 --> 05:29.130
Nothing to worry about.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.590
It's Kidsmas.

05:30.590 --> 05:34.660
Santa magic will take
care of everything.

05:34.660 --> 05:35.730
-Santa magic?

05:39.260 --> 05:42.110
-It is a thrill to be on the
Music Committee with you guys.

05:42.110 --> 05:45.250
So let's warm up a
little bit, shall we?

05:45.250 --> 05:48.700
(SINGING) La la la la la la la.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.590
[SINGING]

05:53.520 --> 05:54.970
-Private.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.110
86 that caterwaul.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.750
-Curse you, Internet.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.980
28,000 cat videos, zero
useful information.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.730
-We wish you a
"meow-y" Christmas.

06:09.730 --> 06:12.240
I'm sorry, Skipper, but
it's just one party.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.050
Do you need the
real Santa magic?

06:14.050 --> 06:18.900
-If Mr. Tub of Jolly has
some sparkly, mystic secret,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.150
I need to find it ASAP.

06:20.150 --> 06:21.430
-Then we should ask Santa.

06:21.430 --> 06:23.660
He'd know.

06:23.660 --> 06:24.360
Don't get up.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.560
I'll do it for you.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.110
-Good thinking, young Private.

06:27.110 --> 06:27.810
Let's slide.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.530
-So I'm thikning the
Eastern White Pine.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.190
Or maybe you're more
of a Douglas Fir guy.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.030
That's cool.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.670
Norway Spruce?

06:42.670 --> 06:46.030
-Must I even louder
for you, Maurice?

06:46.030 --> 06:49.110
It is not the flavour of the
tree that is the problem.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.190
It is the not importance of it.

06:51.190 --> 06:54.770
-I thought tree choosing was
the most importantest job.

06:54.770 --> 06:57.690
-Yeah, it was-- until
the frowny flatted

06:57.690 --> 06:59.710
penguin got the better one.

06:59.710 --> 07:04.980
Now we must find the amazingest
tree in the history of Kidsmas.

07:04.980 --> 07:07.080
-You really think we can
find a tree like that?

07:07.080 --> 07:10.980
-Hey, this is New York City,
baby, the capital of France.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.590
If you can't find it here, you
can not be finding it anywhere.

07:14.590 --> 07:18.440
-I will find the amazing
tree, King Julien.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.510
Is this one amazing?

07:21.510 --> 07:23.720
-Jolly old Saint Nick in sight.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.440
Now show me your
secrets, magic man.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.230
-I don't understand, Skipper.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.070
-Yes.

07:29.070 --> 07:29.960
Why is the bell ringing?

07:29.960 --> 07:31.030
And a tip jar?

07:31.030 --> 07:33.210
That just seems crass.

07:33.210 --> 07:33.960
-No.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.090
I mean, I don't understand
why there are two of them.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.030
-What?

07:37.030 --> 07:38.680
Sweet Secret Service!

07:38.680 --> 07:39.940
He's got a body double.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.870
There must be some primo
magic he's projecting.

07:42.870 --> 07:43.860
-Look.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.090
They're leaving.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.790
-Blast!

07:45.790 --> 07:47.740
No time to ID which
one is the phony.

07:47.740 --> 07:50.320
Private, pin a tail
on the Santa Bravo.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.130
I'm on the Alpha Clause.

08:15.650 --> 08:16.670
-Look, Sweetie.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.410
It's Santa!

08:26.490 --> 08:27.540
-Never mind, Mort.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.360
Your face tried, but the
glass just wanted it more.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.330
-I'm tapped out, Your Majesty.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.410
We've seen real
trees, fake trees--

08:35.410 --> 08:36.580
-Toilet trees!

08:36.580 --> 08:38.640
-And you keep turning up
your nose at all of them.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.420
-Because none is amazing enough
to beat the Santa penguin.

08:42.420 --> 08:46.330
I need a tree that sits up,
smacks you upon the face

08:46.330 --> 08:47.900
and says Christmas!

08:47.900 --> 08:50.450
-This one says it
in 17 languages.

08:50.450 --> 08:52.610
-Merry Christmas.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.240
Feliz Navidad.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.940
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

09:00.350 --> 09:01.900
-I found it!

09:01.900 --> 09:04.870
The amazing tree!

09:04.870 --> 09:07.560
I know it is small and ugly.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.740
But if somebody was
nice to it and loved it,

09:10.740 --> 09:14.350
it could grow up to
be a beautiful swan.

09:14.350 --> 09:18.040
And that is the true
meaning of Chinese New Year.

09:18.040 --> 09:18.750
-Christmas.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.250
-What's a Christmas?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.530
-That tree is perfect.

09:22.530 --> 09:25.660
Now move the puny tree so I
can get a good look at it.

09:28.330 --> 09:29.800
Chopity chopity chopping.

09:47.370 --> 09:48.690
-Oh, minty.

09:54.890 --> 09:55.870
-Private!

09:55.870 --> 09:57.950
I thought I put you on
Santa surveillance duty.

09:57.950 --> 10:01.340
-Oh, well, Skipper,
he went in there.

10:01.340 --> 10:02.040
-Impossible.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.920
My Santa went in there.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.720
Why even have a body
double if you're just

10:05.720 --> 10:07.260
going to hang out
in the same room?

10:07.260 --> 10:09.240
-About that-- isn't
it a bit fishy

10:09.240 --> 10:11.940
that Santa is just
strolling about on Christmas

10:11.940 --> 10:15.280
Eve with no reindeer or sleigh?

10:15.280 --> 10:18.600
And he's using an elevator?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.740
-Both fakes?

10:19.740 --> 10:21.980
Then how are those
two phony Papa Noels

10:21.980 --> 10:23.860
tied into this
mysterious disappearance?

10:23.860 --> 10:24.700
-Wait.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.070
Santa disappeared?

10:26.070 --> 10:27.930
-You haven't seen him, have you?

10:27.930 --> 10:28.840
-Well, no.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.370
But-- you don't think--

10:30.370 --> 10:31.070
-No.

10:31.070 --> 10:35.620
I act with maximum force.

10:35.620 --> 10:38.410
Initiate Takedown
Protocol Foxtrot, Private.

10:38.410 --> 10:46.010
You get the first one, I'll
handle-- oh, sugar plums.

10:49.620 --> 10:50.320
-Skipper?

10:50.320 --> 10:52.150
-Windup Monkey
Misdirect, execute!

11:00.350 --> 11:01.050
-Cute toys.

11:01.050 --> 11:03.680
You know where I could pick
up a couple for my kid?

11:03.680 --> 11:04.380
-OK.

11:04.380 --> 11:09.390
I'll take the lead voice,
you'll take the astonado.

11:09.390 --> 11:11.250
The ding dongs.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.210
[SINGING]

11:14.210 --> 11:17.010
-(SINGING) Here come the
bells, I hear the bells.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.030
That's not the bells.

11:18.030 --> 11:21.120
What is going on here?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.400
Excuse me, fellas.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.010
We're on kind of a tight
schedule here, and I don't--

11:25.010 --> 11:26.230
-So shut it, already.

11:26.230 --> 11:30.040
We're trying to write
a Kidsmas [MUMBLES].

11:30.040 --> 11:31.200
-Hey, yo, Bing.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.060
You got a rhyme for yellow snow?

11:33.060 --> 11:33.760
-OK.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.300
How about-- what?

11:36.300 --> 11:37.000
Backing off.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.830
-Rock and roll, Rico.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.800
Just a few hours till
daylight, and the zoo

11:43.800 --> 11:45.290
is only halfway decorated.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.340
-Pardon me.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.040
I was just--

11:51.690 --> 11:52.390
-Guys?

11:52.390 --> 11:53.770
What are you doing?

11:53.770 --> 11:55.830
-Our jobs, obviously.

11:55.830 --> 12:00.110
-Decorating in 19th-century
Dickensian regalia.

12:00.110 --> 12:00.830
-Woah, woah.

12:00.830 --> 12:03.560
OK, first, we're the
decorations committee.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.130
Second, Dickens?

12:06.130 --> 12:06.830
Yeah.

12:06.830 --> 12:07.980
Did you get a visit
from the ghost

12:07.980 --> 12:10.340
of Christmas Been
There Done That?

12:10.340 --> 12:11.090
-No, no.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.400
We are the
decorations committee.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.280
And at least our
ideas didn't come

12:15.280 --> 12:18.260
from the pages of
Winter Hooligan Monthly.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.110
-Hey.

12:19.110 --> 12:21.510
How did you know that?

12:21.510 --> 12:23.960
-I guess we were all supposed
to work together, huh?

12:23.960 --> 12:24.850
-No problem.

12:24.850 --> 12:27.070
We can clear your
junk out in no time.

12:27.070 --> 12:29.700
[MUMBLES]

12:29.700 --> 12:31.720
-I say humbug to you, sir.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.210
Humbug, humbug, humbug.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.580
-Guys, guys, obviously there's
a difference in styles here.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.300
But come on-- it's Christmas.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.630
There's nothing we can't fix
with a little peace, love,

12:42.630 --> 12:44.270
and togetherness.

12:44.270 --> 12:44.970
-You know what?

12:44.970 --> 12:47.880
I know. [MUMBLES]

12:49.240 --> 12:53.370
-Tut tut, old bean,
think nothing of it.

12:53.370 --> 12:54.750
-OK, great.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.960
So how do we solve this?

12:56.960 --> 13:00.860
-Let's say elephant rules.

13:00.860 --> 13:01.560
-OK.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.700
What are elephant rules?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.970
-(SINGING) Smash and stomp
with Burt's great heinie.

13:06.970 --> 13:10.700
Squash-a squash-a
squash, squash squash.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.830
Cheerio!

13:11.830 --> 13:15.540
-Rico, my man, this otter is
about to join the naughty list.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.610
-Not the sleigh!

13:22.610 --> 13:24.430
-Hey, not a bad
charity haul this year.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.630
-Merry Christmas, guys.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.680
-Merry Christmas.

13:29.090 --> 13:29.790
-Huh?

13:36.220 --> 13:37.260
What?

13:37.260 --> 13:39.240
-Where is Santa Claus?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.670
-What is this,
some kind of joke?

13:40.670 --> 13:42.230
Esposito, is that you?

13:42.230 --> 13:44.590
-Can we really have time
for conspiracies, Skipper?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.840
You promised the children the
zoo would be ready for Kidsmas.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.320
-Santa magic, Private.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.840
We get that, and we're walking
in a winter wonderland.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.890
-Where are you
anti yule radicals

13:53.890 --> 13:56.480
holding Santa and his magic?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.160
-Hey, seriously, where am I?

13:58.160 --> 14:01.770
-You are on the path
to Painsylvania.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.190
Ha ha ha.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.060
-I'm a lumberjack.

14:13.060 --> 14:13.820
Arr, matey.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.360
-Hey, somebody is
stealing the big tree!

14:19.360 --> 14:20.940
Not in my city, pal.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.450
-Look at their faces!

14:25.450 --> 14:26.320
Punch it.

14:29.250 --> 14:34.480
-This is Chuck Charles, and my
van has just been stolen along

14:34.480 --> 14:37.070
with the city's Christmas tree.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.800
-Chuck, without
the van, we're not

14:38.800 --> 14:40.290
really broadcasting anything.

14:40.290 --> 14:43.520
-I know, but I am no longer
able to speak in a normal voice.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.160
-The real Santa
must have escaped.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.420
And the impostors are
trying to haul him back in.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.950
Execute Mobile Rescue Op.

14:56.950 --> 14:59.370
-But Skipper, the zoo, Kidsmas!

14:59.370 --> 15:00.720
-Follow the magic, Private!

15:00.720 --> 15:02.320
Remember the winter
wonderland plan.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.600
-Uh huh.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.300
-Oh, a plan.

15:17.300 --> 15:17.470
Good.

15:17.470 --> 15:18.170
What did he say?

15:22.310 --> 15:23.780
-Pow, pow, pow!

15:32.580 --> 15:34.580
-We are losing more
plywood men by the second.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.520
-Hold your ground!

15:36.520 --> 15:38.280
We all knew there
would be casualties.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.670
They got Tiny Tim!

15:44.670 --> 15:47.840
-You may strike out
decorations, but you shall never

15:47.840 --> 15:50.760
conquer the spirit
of Charles Dickens.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.850
-And his razor-brimmed top hat!

15:56.470 --> 15:58.130
-Actually, I don't
believe Dickens

15:58.130 --> 15:59.960
had a razor-brimmed hat.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.340
-Learn your history, chimp.

16:03.950 --> 16:06.630
-(SINGING) Dashing
through the street,

16:06.630 --> 16:10.640
I think it's pretty neat that we
scored the best Christmas tree,

16:10.640 --> 16:13.080
hey penguins, you can't eat it.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.870
Julien, Julien, you
really are too much.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.690
-(SINGING) It's time
that thing let off

16:18.690 --> 16:22.810
the gas and stepped
on me, the clutch!

16:22.810 --> 16:24.890
-I'm being high speed chasing!

16:24.890 --> 16:26.320
-Quick, pull the clutch.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.850
-Impostors dispatched.

16:58.850 --> 17:03.400
Now let's go rescue the
genuine one and only Santa.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.260
-Santa?

17:04.260 --> 17:04.960
-Ringtail.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.570
-Santa!

17:07.570 --> 17:08.980
-Tree!

17:08.980 --> 17:09.840
-Animals!

17:09.840 --> 17:11.510
-Confused potato!

17:11.510 --> 17:12.350
-Abandon van.

17:12.350 --> 17:13.710
We must save the tree!

17:16.440 --> 17:19.410
-What in the name of good
King Wentz's laws are you--

17:28.740 --> 17:30.150
-Are you sure we're
not too early?

17:35.180 --> 17:38.750
-Welcome to our Kidsmas
winter funderland.

17:38.750 --> 17:43.370
-A'sooth, the last doth mean
our Dickensian celebration of--

17:43.370 --> 17:44.320
-Party!

17:44.320 --> 17:45.390
-You know what?

17:45.390 --> 17:48.270
Maybe we'll just come back
on a different holiday.

17:48.270 --> 17:49.900
-No, no, it's OK, really.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.160
We got big fun ahead.

17:51.160 --> 17:58.970
We got music-- and games!

17:58.970 --> 18:00.130
We've got games!

18:00.130 --> 18:02.660
-Who wants first go
at the Santa pinata?

18:05.900 --> 18:08.010
-Why, you call this
a children's party?

18:08.010 --> 18:08.840
We're leaving.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.550
-Wait!

18:09.550 --> 18:11.640
We haven't even decorated
the Christmas tree yet.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.590
-I'd like to go home now.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.620
-Somebody want to tell
me what in the Jack Frost

18:26.620 --> 18:27.960
is going on here?

18:27.960 --> 18:30.550
-Well, Skipper, it
seems some people don't

18:30.550 --> 18:32.720
appreciate the finer
decorating arts.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.960
-And some people are suffering
from chronic boring disorder.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.750
-And some people wrecked my
completely awesome Christmasy

18:40.750 --> 18:41.450
tree.

18:41.450 --> 18:42.700
-You were one of those people.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.320
-I was deliberately being vague.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.230
-I had a vision.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.310
-Fa la la la la, la boo hoo hoo.

18:51.310 --> 18:53.110
Didn't I want you people?

18:53.110 --> 18:56.940
I can't leave you alone for
one night without a-- huh?

18:56.940 --> 19:00.380
-You said this would
be the best Kidsmas.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.160
You promised.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.140
-Aww, man.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.930
-We-- we ruined Kidsmas.

19:08.930 --> 19:09.620
-No.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.620
I'm the Santa here.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.610
This was on my watch.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.600
What have I done?

19:31.730 --> 19:35.890
-Well, for starters, you roughed
up a dozen of my deputies

19:35.890 --> 19:39.230
and helped wreck the world's
most famous Christmas tree.

19:39.230 --> 19:42.560
And I thought I
had a busy night.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.030
Hey, Julien.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.740
-Sup, baby?

19:45.740 --> 19:46.940
Here we go, [INAUDIBLE].

19:46.940 --> 19:47.640
-Santa?

19:47.640 --> 19:49.070
Real Santa?

19:49.070 --> 19:52.190
Those dime store phony
Clauses work for you?

19:52.190 --> 19:53.630
-They do the charity work.

19:53.630 --> 19:54.960
I deliver the toys.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.230
It works out great when they're
not being karate chopped

19:58.230 --> 20:00.110
off a speeding Christmas tree.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.590
-We're sorry, Santa.

20:01.590 --> 20:03.980
We didn't mean to make
such a mess of things.

20:03.980 --> 20:08.240
-All I wanted was a tiny taste
of that real Santa magic.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.040
-Santa magic?

20:10.040 --> 20:13.550
But Skipper, you had
that from the beginning.

20:13.550 --> 20:14.250
-Really?

20:14.250 --> 20:15.400
Well, then how do I use--

20:15.400 --> 20:18.000
-What am I, your
guidance counsellor?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.950
I got a haul toys to
seven more time zones.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.880
Trust me, you'll figure it out.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.000
-What do you suppose he meant?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.710
You had it from the beginning?

20:29.710 --> 20:32.260
-The beginning-- I
don't-- of course!

20:32.260 --> 20:33.160
-Skipper?

20:33.160 --> 20:36.100
-Santa magic coursing
through veins.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.550
Feels ginerbready.

20:38.550 --> 20:39.930
Follow my lead, people!

20:39.930 --> 20:42.120
And can I get some
holiday music here?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.770
-That would be
perfect, except that we

20:43.770 --> 20:45.100
haven't practised
as much as we--

20:45.100 --> 20:45.960
-Yo, absolutely.

20:49.330 --> 20:54.010
-Santa magic says try it in G.

20:54.010 --> 20:57.610
-(SINGING) It's Christmas day,
but you're feeling low with

20:57.610 --> 21:01.870
the cold grey skies
and the yellow snow.

21:01.870 --> 21:05.470
-Something, something,
something, [MUMBLES]

21:05.470 --> 21:07.450
-(SINGING) But
I'll tell you about

21:07.450 --> 21:12.200
one thing you've got to know.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.310
-(SINGING) It ain't
perfect, but it's Christmas.

21:15.310 --> 21:18.660
So what if you didn't get
all your Christmas wishes?

21:18.660 --> 21:22.060
There ain't another day that's
a better one than this is.

21:22.060 --> 21:26.010
'Cause it ain't perfect, yo,
but it's still Christmas.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.780
-So Santa's got the best
things that were on your list.

21:28.780 --> 21:32.610
-And soldier, tell that
frown to cease and desist.

21:32.610 --> 21:38.480
-If you know where to look,
you'll find Christmas place.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.650
-Oh, that's pretty.

21:39.650 --> 21:41.340
We'll sing it one more time.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.260
Maybe you will catch the jist.

21:47.650 --> 21:52.500
-It ain't perfect,
but it's Christmas.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.930
So if the day's--

21:54.930 --> 21:58.100
-Had a few minor glitches?

21:58.100 --> 22:05.230
-Just clean up the mess and
help your mum with the dishes.

22:05.230 --> 22:06.350
-'Cause kids--

22:06.350 --> 22:11.210
-It ain't perfect, no,
but it's still Christmas,

22:11.210 --> 22:15.090
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas!

22:19.470 --> 22:20.940
Christmas!

22:20.940 --> 22:22.180
-Ho, ho, ho.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.190
-You really did it!

22:23.190 --> 22:24.430
You found the Santa magic?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.750
What was the secret?

22:25.750 --> 22:27.160
-No secret, Private.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.680
Big Red was right.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.220
We had to get back to where
this all started-- trying

22:31.220 --> 22:33.710
to make some kids
happy for Christmas.

22:33.710 --> 22:34.410
-That's it?

22:34.410 --> 22:36.330
Santa magic is just
making people happy?

22:36.330 --> 22:37.030
-Yeah.

22:37.030 --> 22:38.310
Seems to work for that guy.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.050
-Merry Christmas,
Mr. Skipper Penguin.

22:56.050 --> 22:58.870
-And to all a good night.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.420
-Potato.
