WEBVTT

01:04.438 --> 01:05.440
Bailey?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.151
Bailey, we gotta get out of here.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.989
We gotta go. Bailey.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.285
Fuck!

01:19.329 --> 01:20.455
Bailey?

01:33.969 --> 01:34.970
Okay.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.765
Excuse me.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.060
Can you hold the--

01:43.937 --> 01:44.938
Fuck.

02:01.288 --> 02:05.209
Hey. Have you seen a teenage girl?
Sixteen, blonde, pink streaks.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.878
I just got here. I don't see her.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.345
Need a cab, ma'am?

02:23.810 --> 02:24.978
Shit.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.398
Bailey?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.684
Tell me there's orange chicken
in that bag.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.935
Am I new here?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.354
- You're a little new.
- Okay.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.067
Good day at work?

03:12.609 --> 03:13.819
Better now that it's over.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.240
Do I get to stay? Or are you still in it?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.826
I'm still in it, sadly.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.828
It looks great.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.663
It's getting there.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.747
Yeah.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.336
You thinking about tomorrow?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.883
It's just an article.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.306
It's a long article. A feature article.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.309
- Stop.
- Headline on the cover.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.060
You can leave my chicken and go.

03:48.020 --> 03:52.649
Okay. But I may have left a message
on the inter-office voice mail,

03:52.649 --> 03:54.860
you know,
just reminding everyone to pick up a copy.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.778
You are not helping.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.170
I'll wait up.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.048
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't have to go right this second.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.236
So, I was thinking
we should celebrate this weekend.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.572
What I think we should do
is stop talking about the article.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.159
I was talking about our anniversary.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.328
- What?
- Fourteen months.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.249
I don't think 14 months qualifies
as an anniversary.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.834
It does to me.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.632
Do you remember how I lost
my parking ticket on our second date?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.092
That was me.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.593
Sure, but it was my fault.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.012
That I lost my parking ticket?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.597
I distracted you.

05:05.597 --> 05:09.268
Oh, wow. That's true.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.566
I was so surprised
that this was happening.

05:17.359 --> 05:21.405
I got to sit, have dinner and be with you.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.574
I was just--

05:25.409 --> 05:30.706
I thought that part of my life was over,
that I didn't get to have that.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.001
Awfully serious tonight, Mr. Michaels.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.672
Well, it is our 14-month anniversary.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.093
So, what do you say?

05:44.178 --> 05:46.430
Drive out to Sonoma
on Saturday and celebrate?

05:49.725 --> 05:51.685
Do you think Bailey would wanna come?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.022
Absolutely.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.650
Liar.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.407
- I'll ask her.
- You're such a liar.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.464
Liar.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.531
Morning.

06:46.198 --> 06:49.243
Do you think anchovy-garlic dressing
has to involve anchovies?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.537
Probably. Why?

06:52.079 --> 06:57.209
I was thinking of making the dinner
we had at Poggio, the pasta Bailey liked.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.755
- Don't be so surprised.
- No, no.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.299
- I cook. I can cook.
- I know, I know. It--

07:04.299 --> 07:06.593
It just sounds ambitious,

07:06.593 --> 07:10.430
especially when we could, you know,
order in from Poggio.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.640
You're such a wiseass.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.813
Is that Avett again?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.234
It's pretty insistent, even for him.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.236
Yeah. Same old shit.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.825
- Morning, Bailey.
- Can we go?

07:29.825 --> 07:32.202
Well, I think I should get dressed first.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.037
Dad, I'm gonna be late.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.790
Bails, we're all of five minutes
from school.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.793
I know for a fact first period
doesn't start for 20.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.588
How about we start with "Good morning"?

07:46.300 --> 07:47.634
I'll wait out front.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.308
Maybe I'll start running in the morning.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.812
- Just-- Just wait it out.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.652
- You better go.
- All right. I know.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.827
You keep this up,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.330
you're gonna be carrying the worms
next time we go fishing.

08:17.206 --> 08:21.001
Gross. We haven't gone fishing in,
like, three years.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.669
Okay.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.465
I'm gonna get you to go with me again,
and when I do,

08:27.424 --> 08:29.426
you're not gonna wanna carry the worms.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.263
Maybe it's time to try a little harder.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.558
Well, you're always telling me,
"If you don't have anything nice to say"--

08:37.558 --> 08:41.230
Bails, she's making a real effort.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.315
I'm just saying.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.526
Got it.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.362
Can I drive?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.534
How about tomorrow? Huh?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.577
What was the point
of letting me get my permit

08:55.577 --> 08:57.204
if you never even let me practice?

08:57.204 --> 09:00.415
I want you to practice, you know,
just with the ignition off.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.961
On a scale from one to ten,

09:03.961 --> 09:06.380
how offended will you be
if I sit in the back?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.298
- Dad.
- What? Safety first.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.517
Hello.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.143
<i>I'm looking for Owen Michaels.</i>

09:20.143 --> 09:21.937
Owen just left. Can I take a--

10:33.967 --> 10:35.719
Hey, Devaughn. Just the chair.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.024
- Hey.
- <i>Hey. I just saw you called.</i>

10:49.024 --> 10:51.401
I'm in the city.
Wanna grab an early lunch?

10:51.401 --> 10:53.612
Always, but I have a lunch date.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.155
<i>Max must be jealous.</i>

10:55.155 --> 10:57.699
Only 'cause metro reporters
don't get to sit in on profiles

10:57.699 --> 10:59.326
<i>with Gold Glove-winning shortstops.</i>

10:59.326 --> 11:00.911
<i>How about coffee later this afternoon?</i>

11:00.911 --> 11:02.704
Can't. I have a client meeting in Tiburon.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.332
I just stopped by the ferry building
to grab bread for dinner.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.875
They don't have bread in Sausalito?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.043
<i>It's from Acme.</i>

11:08.043 --> 11:09.586
They serve it at Poggio.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.421
We took Bailey there
the other night, and--

11:11.421 --> 11:13.507
<i>And now we're driving 45 minutes</i>

11:13.507 --> 11:14.800
to get bread for Bailey?

11:14.800 --> 11:18.053
No, I was dropping off a couple pieces
with Ash anyway.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.596
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

11:19.596 --> 11:21.849
In my defense, it is delicious bread.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.851
You know,
any therapist worth their salt would say

11:23.851 --> 11:26.645
that trying this hard
for Bailey is not about Bailey.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.023
<i>Oh, right. So, you're a therapist now?</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:32.359
I'd make a great fucking therapist.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.069
I'm just getting off with Jules.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.238
- Hey, love.
- <i>Hi, Ash.</i>

11:36.238 --> 11:38.282
- <i>Hey, Hannah, give me a sec?</i>
- Yeah, of course.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.869
This is stunning.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.496
And it won't last the weekend
now that you're so fancy.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.918
Wow, that's a big photo.

11:50.794 --> 11:51.962
<i>Shit.</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:53.046
What's wrong?

11:54.464 --> 11:55.465
<i>Jules?</i>

11:56.842 --> 11:59.720
I gotta call Max back.
She's freaking out about something.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.723
<i>Who am I to stand in the way of true love?</i>

12:02.723 --> 12:03.932
Not today, it isn't.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.476
- <i>Love you. Bye.</i>
- Love you. Bye.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.979
Is this the famous grandfather?

12:10.272 --> 12:13.192
I think he would've gotten a kick out
of seeing his picture in the magazine,

12:13.901 --> 12:14.902
despite himself.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.446
Are you sure there's nothing of his
that I could show?

12:17.446 --> 12:19.698
Nope. Still not for sale.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.621
<i>Hey, it's Owen. Leave a message.</i>

12:26.163 --> 12:28.415
Hey, it's me. Let me know
when you're heading home.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.836
And just a reminder, if you beat me there,
the rest of the orange chicken is mine.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.838
Love you.

13:19.675 --> 13:20.926
Bailey, can you get that?

13:22.970 --> 13:23.971
Bailey!

13:36.024 --> 13:37.025
Hello?

13:37.693 --> 13:42.823
- Mrs. Michaels?
- Yes. No one calls me that.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.869
- Are you a friend of Bailey's?
- No.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.204
Mr. Michaels asked me to give this to you.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.708
Where did--
Where did you see Mr. Michaels?

13:52.708 --> 13:55.294
- He ran past me in the hall.
- In the hall?

13:55.294 --> 13:58.714
At school. He gave me 20 bucks
to drop this off.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.508
I kinda need to...

14:02.551 --> 14:03.927
Yeah, sure. Of course.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.996
What's that smell?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.040
It's dinner.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.250
I hope not.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.887
Do you know where my dad is?
He said he'd be home by now.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.347
Yeah, I was just gonna call him.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.851
<i>Hey, it's Owen. Leave a message.</i>

14:53.519 --> 14:57.481
Hey, it's me. You're probably
on your way, but give me a call.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.653
I'll just grab a Clif Bar.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.280
I gotta get to rehearsal anyway.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.784
No. I'll take you.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.579
Suz just texted.
She's literally right on the dock.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.581
Just tell my dad I'll catch a ride home.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.502
- Hey, Bailey--
- Thanks for dinner.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.976
<i>Hey, you've reached Jules.
Leave a message.</i>

15:51.869 --> 15:53.245
<i>Hello, this is The Shop.</i>

15:53.245 --> 15:55.497
Hey, Greg. It's Hannah. Is Owen there?

15:55.497 --> 15:59.001
<i>Hey, Hannah. Yeah, I don't think he's--</i>

15:59.960 --> 16:02.171
<i>None of the senior staff
are available at the moment.</i>

16:02.671 --> 16:03.714
- What?
<i>- Yeah--</i>

16:03.714 --> 16:05.424
<i>Sir, you can't be on the phone.</i>

16:05.424 --> 16:07.426
<i>Look, I'm so sorry, Hannah. I have to go.</i>

16:35.871 --> 16:36.872
What is--

16:55.641 --> 16:57.643
Hey. Sorry, ma'am, the building's closed.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.020
My husband works inside.
I'm trying to reach him.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.104
What's his name?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.066
Ma'am?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.068
What's his name?

17:08.529 --> 17:09.695
Who is your husband?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.575
Ma'am. Hey.
Hey, excuse me, who's your husband?

17:15.410 --> 17:16.411
Ma'am?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.237
Let's go, Mr. Thompson. Come on.

17:51.697 --> 17:52.698
Avett.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.408
Oh, shit.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.078
Watch your head.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.944
<i>What's hard is simple</i>

18:31.653 --> 18:35.490
<i>What's natural comes hard</i>

18:37.201 --> 18:42.331
<i>Maybe you could show me how to let go</i>

18:42.331 --> 18:45.083
<i>Lower my guard</i>

18:45.083 --> 18:50.214
<i>Learn to be free</i>

18:50.923 --> 18:54.051
<i>Maybe if you whistle</i>

18:55.052 --> 19:01.892
<i>Whistle for me</i>

19:08.106 --> 19:09.399
Very nice, Bailey.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.527
You're done for the night.
Rest those pipes.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.530
Okay, can we clear these cubes?

19:14.530 --> 19:19.034
And we'll go right into a quick
run-through of "Everybody Says Don't."

19:19.034 --> 19:20.118
Okay?

19:27.918 --> 19:29.127
Bravo.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.588
What are you doing here?

19:36.343 --> 19:39.972
Practice ended early.
Thought I'd come say hi.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.098
Hi.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.225
You done here? Give you a ride home?

19:44.560 --> 19:47.729
I have one, unfortunately.
Maleficent's out there.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.900
I don't even know why she's here.
I told her I had it handled.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.207
<i>Hey, it's Owen. Leave a message.</i>

20:29.479 --> 20:32.524
I'm just saying,
my dad's probably not gonna be psyched

20:32.524 --> 20:34.902
for me to be alone with you
in the wilderness.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.529
It's a yurt with a king bed.

20:37.529 --> 20:41.450
Yeah. I don't think mentioning the bed
is gonna help our cause.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.371
Could just say you're staying at Suz's.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.918
She'd cover for you.
It'd be our little secret?

20:52.211 --> 20:53.962
My dad and I don't have secrets.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.924
Well, you should probably work on that.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.976
I should go before Hannah loses her shit.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.813
Okay. But talk to your dad, will you?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.943
Tell him I'll be a gentleman.

21:17.945 --> 21:19.571
I definitely won't tell him that.

21:25.702 --> 21:26.912
Text me later.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.003
What the...

22:20.883 --> 22:22.050
Hi.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.513
Bailey?

22:33.437 --> 22:34.646
Is that from your dad?

22:51.038 --> 22:52.080
Where is he?

22:54.124 --> 22:55.292
Where's my dad?

22:57.628 --> 22:58.795
I don't know.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.423
There's something happening at The Shop.

23:02.633 --> 23:03.967
Avett's been arrested.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.597
I haven't been able to reach him.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.811
<i>Hey, it's Owen. Leave a me--</i>

23:20.484 --> 23:21.568
What is that?

23:44.299 --> 23:45.342
Hannah?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.126
Are you okay?

24:20.085 --> 24:21.295
Fine.

25:15.182 --> 25:16.892
Is that the <i>Chronicle</i> piece?

25:16.892 --> 25:18.018
What? No.

25:19.603 --> 25:22.356
- There's a <i>Chronicle</i> piece?
- Yeah.

25:22.356 --> 25:23.857
- Does it--
- It doesn't mention your dad.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.275
It's just about Avett.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.365
<i>Daily Beast</i> is tweeting
they're the new Enron.

25:31.365 --> 25:34.243
Lynn Williams keeps sharing their tweets
on her story.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.788
About how The Shop
committed a billion-dollar fraud,

25:37.788 --> 25:39.581
how everyone who works there is in on it.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.458
- That's not true.
- She keeps tagging me.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.086
It's not true.
Lynn Williams should not be tagging you.

25:44.086 --> 25:45.504
So where is he, Hannah?

25:48.507 --> 25:49.716
Why'd he leave me this money?

25:53.470 --> 25:55.430
Let's go inside, okay?

25:55.973 --> 25:59.852
I'm gonna make some calls.
Somebody will know where your father is.

26:00.394 --> 26:03.772
Let's start there.
Let's find out where he is.

26:07.609 --> 26:11.697
Bailey, he's gonna have an explanation.
You know he will.

26:16.618 --> 26:21.707
Okay, but I'm texting Bobby to come over,
unless you want me to go there.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.293
No. He can come here.

26:26.128 --> 26:28.297
Maybe let's keep the money
to ourselves for now.

26:28.297 --> 26:29.965
Oh, you think?

26:41.977 --> 26:43.020
Hey.

26:51.778 --> 26:52.821
Hey.

26:58.202 --> 27:01.038
We need to get inside, okay? Trust me.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.017
How's she holding up?

27:23.101 --> 27:24.520
Okay. Got it.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.855
Where can we talk?

27:26.855 --> 27:29.149
Back deck. I'm just gonna grab a sweater.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.234
Okay.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.114
He didn't pack.

28:18.407 --> 28:19.658
- Okay.
- I'm just saying.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.244
His suitcase,
all his clothes, they're still here.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.166
You know something.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.338
She can't hear you.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.923
Are you sure?

28:42.055 --> 28:43.056
Now I am.

28:52.149 --> 28:55.319
Max got a tip this morning
from a friend of hers at the SEC.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.197
It's why she was trying to reach me.

28:58.197 --> 29:01.366
According to this friend,
The Shop's new software doesn't work.

29:02.034 --> 29:04.328
What? I thought it was selling like crazy.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.747
Owen told you it was selling already?

29:07.873 --> 29:09.124
No, it was Avett.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.462
Okay. What did he say exactly?

29:13.962 --> 29:16.840
He and Belle came for dinner
before the IPO last month.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.677
Avett couldn't stop talking
about how insane the sales were.

29:20.677 --> 29:25.349
Except there were no sales,
just interest in a software demo.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.560
Apparently, anytime a buyer
expressed interest in the demo,

29:28.560 --> 29:30.354
Avett put it down on the books as revenue.

29:30.354 --> 29:31.271
Oh, Jesus.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.482
Max says it's like what they did at Enron.

29:33.482 --> 29:36.610
They inflated the company's valuation
and drove up the stock price

29:36.610 --> 29:37.819
in advance of the IPO.

29:38.862 --> 29:39.863
And there's the fraud.

29:39.863 --> 29:42.157
Stockholders are gonna lose
half a billion dollars.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.369
Max couldn't believe
that Owen was a part of it.

29:45.369 --> 29:47.246
And honestly,
when she told me this morning,

29:47.246 --> 29:49.081
I couldn't believe it either, so I--

29:50.123 --> 29:51.166
You called Owen.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.838
Well, I called you,
but I couldn't reach you.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.174
So then, yeah, I called Owen.

30:02.135 --> 30:04.555
God, Han. I'm so sorry.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.265
I never thought in a million years--

30:06.265 --> 30:07.558
That he'd run.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.483
I can't believe this is happening.

30:17.317 --> 30:18.402
Yeah, I get it.

30:20.445 --> 30:24.283
Yeah. People do crazy things
when they feel trapped.

30:26.660 --> 30:29.454
Trapped? What do you mean?

30:31.748 --> 30:36.044
Isn't your dad, like,
chief coder or something?

30:36.044 --> 30:37.921
You think he's involved in this?

30:37.921 --> 30:39.131
No, I didn't say that.

30:39.131 --> 30:42.176
- That's not my dad. He would never.
- I know. I just--

30:42.176 --> 30:43.760
That's probably why he's MIA.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.930
He knows every opinionated dumbass
is gonna judge him like you are.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.933
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not judging him.

30:49.933 --> 30:54.438
All I'm saying is your dad's--
Your dad's a really smart guy.

30:55.522 --> 30:58.442
It's a little hard to believe
he didn't know what was going on.

31:00.569 --> 31:04.907
There's definitely no way
he didn't discuss things with her.

31:17.544 --> 31:18.545
You okay?

31:19.838 --> 31:24.009
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just trying
to figure out what he's thinking.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.722
I know it doesn't look good...

31:31.767 --> 31:34.061
but I can't believe Owen
would be caught up in this.

31:36.230 --> 31:39.816
You know Owen,
he's straightforward to a fault.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.444
I feel like we're missing something.

31:52.538 --> 31:53.580
Jules, what?

31:57.292 --> 32:00.003
Sources can't hide it
when they know something.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.674
My mother taught me that
when I started at the <i>Globe</i>.

32:03.674 --> 32:05.717
They forget to ask the obvious questions,

32:05.717 --> 32:08.637
the things they would ask
if they were really in the dark.

32:10.138 --> 32:14.393
If Owen didn't know what was going on,
he would've wanted more information.

32:14.393 --> 32:17.563
Why the Feds were indicting Avett,
what exactly he'd done,

32:17.563 --> 32:21.984
how exposed The Shop was.
But he didn't ask any of that.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.903
That's not what he wanted to know.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.074
What did he wanna know?

32:32.244 --> 32:33.453
How long he had to get out.

32:53.724 --> 32:54.725
See ya.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.393
Call you when I get home.

32:57.811 --> 33:00.898
Listen, you still
have your own checking account, right?

33:00.898 --> 33:02.399
Yeah. Why?

33:02.900 --> 33:05.736
Max thinks the FBI
is gonna freeze Owen's assets

33:05.736 --> 33:07.070
if they haven't already.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.031
They always follow the money.

33:13.577 --> 33:14.703
What?

33:18.415 --> 33:21.919
Nothing.
I just wish I knew what to do for Bailey.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.715
When my mom took off,

33:26.715 --> 33:29.301
my grandfather knew exactly
what to say to me.

33:29.301 --> 33:30.928
So, what do you think he'd say now?

33:33.514 --> 33:34.848
That we have each other.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.727
Pretty sure it's not gonna cut it here.

33:46.568 --> 33:49.154
- Hang in there, Julie.
- Yeah, thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.

33:49.154 --> 33:50.572
Tomorrow.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.566
<i>You live in a floating home?</i>

35:07.566 --> 35:10.194
<i>About as far from New York City
as you can get.</i>

35:11.320 --> 35:13.822
<i>I don't know. I do live on an island.</i>

35:13.822 --> 35:17.159
Do you really want a lesson,
or is this just an excuse to walk me home?

35:17.159 --> 35:19.786
No, no, no. I want the lesson.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.456
I wanna learn how you do what you do.

35:30.797 --> 35:31.632
Where do we start?

35:32.299 --> 35:35.719
<i>Just pick a piece of wood
that speaks to you.</i>

35:35.719 --> 35:39.765
I tend to use oak, distressed pine, cedar.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.016
What's your favorite?

35:41.642 --> 35:43.018
I don't play favorites.

35:44.686 --> 35:45.521
Good to know.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.106
<i>They're all great for different reasons.</i>

35:48.106 --> 35:49.191
Is that my first lesson?

35:50.359 --> 35:54.905
No. Your first lesson is that a good piece
of wood always has one thing,

35:54.905 --> 35:58.116
one quality, that defines it.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.495
What defines this piece?

36:04.331 --> 36:06.291
I think this part
could turn out interesting.

36:08.293 --> 36:09.294
I like that.

36:10.754 --> 36:13.590
Well, you could probably
say the same thing about most people.

36:13.590 --> 36:18.095
At the end of the day,
one thing defines them.

36:20.556 --> 36:21.557
What defines you?

36:24.268 --> 36:25.686
What defines you?

36:25.686 --> 36:27.104
I asked first.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.984
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for my daughter.

37:34.588 --> 37:35.589
It's open.

37:38.675 --> 37:39.968
Can I come in?

37:40.469 --> 37:41.470
Yeah, I guess.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.641
Did you get any sleep?

37:46.975 --> 37:48.018
No, not really.

37:53.232 --> 37:57.486
I keep reading it,
and it doesn't make sense.

38:02.491 --> 38:06.662
"You know what matters about me."
What does that even mean?

38:07.663 --> 38:13.377
I think he probably means you know
how much he loves you.

38:13.377 --> 38:17.965
No, that's not it, Hannah.
I know him. He meant something else.

38:18.465 --> 38:21.176
Yeah, like what?

38:21.176 --> 38:24.304
I don't have any idea.
That's why I'm asking you.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.224
Look, Bailey,
I can't tell you exactly what he meant...

38:29.017 --> 38:31.395
but I have to think
there's a good explanation

38:31.395 --> 38:32.980
for what's going on here.

38:34.606 --> 38:37.985
Why? Why do you have to think that?

38:37.985 --> 38:39.403
Did he tell you something?

38:40.153 --> 38:42.030
What? No.

38:43.323 --> 38:45.367
I'm just as in the dark as you are.

38:59.631 --> 39:00.632
Bailey, I--

39:01.842 --> 39:05.387
I don't know what's happening here,
but I do know your dad loves you.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.600
You really think you need to tell me that?

39:17.858 --> 39:19.193
I'm gonna make breakfast.

39:20.235 --> 39:21.945
I think you should probably
get ready for school.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.740
For school? You're joking, right?

39:30.287 --> 39:31.830
I'm trying here, Bailey.

39:33.290 --> 39:36.001
I'm sorry.
I know I keep saying the wrong things.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.085
At least you know.

40:21.505 --> 40:22.506
Hannah Hall?

40:25.384 --> 40:26.426
Who are you?

40:27.219 --> 40:28.387
I'm a US marshal.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.098
What do you want?

40:33.517 --> 40:36.061
Oat milk, right?
The guy at Fred's told me how you take it.

40:36.061 --> 40:37.813
I can get my own coffee, thanks.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.398
Whatever you like.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.733
Right now,
I'd like you to get off my dock.

40:41.733 --> 40:43.026
Fair enough, okay?

40:43.026 --> 40:45.863
If I hadn't heard from my spouse
in 24 hours and a US marshal showed up

40:45.863 --> 40:48.574
at my doorstep,
I'd probably feel the same.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.743
That was the last time
you heard from him, right?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.454
Before he left for work yesterday?

40:57.708 --> 41:00.419
The thing is, if your husband
said something about where he was going,

41:00.419 --> 41:03.005
I need to know.
That's the only way for me to protect him.

41:03.714 --> 41:06.675
Is that why you're here?
To protect my husband?

41:09.511 --> 41:13.891
Okay. Look, you should lay low
till this all sorts itself out,

41:14.683 --> 41:15.684
and get yourself a lawyer.

41:15.684 --> 41:16.852
Why would I need a lawyer?

41:18.020 --> 41:19.146
Well, for starters,

41:19.146 --> 41:21.190
so you don't have to answer questions
you don't wanna answer.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.233
- Like yours?
- Exactly.

41:25.444 --> 41:26.486
That's my cell.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.907
If Owen reaches out, tell him I can help.

41:35.078 --> 41:38.373
Is there-- What do you know that I don't?

41:43.712 --> 41:49.343
Look, Owen hasn't used his credit card
in 24 hours, not his ATM, not a check.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.428
And you can stop calling his phone.
I'm sure he's dumped it.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.930
If he calls you, it'll be from a burner

41:52.930 --> 41:54.890
or some other phone
that isn't readily traceable,

41:54.890 --> 41:57.059
but I think he's too smart
to take that chance either.

41:57.059 --> 42:00.103
Why are you making him sound
like some sort of criminal mastermind?

42:03.273 --> 42:07.402
You have my cell. Call anytime.
I'll help you too, if you let me.

42:11.365 --> 42:14.076
How? How could you possibly help me?

42:17.079 --> 42:21.750
Getting through this.
Course, that'll be the easy part.

42:23.794 --> 42:25.003
What's the hard part?

42:27.965 --> 42:31.426
Owen Michaels is not who you think he is.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.199
<i>Hey, it's Owen. Leave a message.</i>
