WEBVTT

00:10.469 --> 00:12.846
-Arthur, what's up, man?
-Hey, Jason, how you doing?

00:12.930 --> 00:14.223
- Doing all right.
- Pleasure.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.435
Mind if I record?

00:18.519 --> 00:19.770
Oh, yeah, no problem, man.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.773
Cool, cool, cool, cool with that.
Let me get that there.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.857
Boom.

00:23.941 --> 00:24.983
-You gonna get something to eat?
-Yeah.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.069
-There's some good food here, man.
-I'mma get somethin'...

00:27.152 --> 00:29.988
Uh, so, <i>Hoop Dreams.</i>
Twenty years, man.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.407
- Twenty-plus years, man.
- Twenty-plus years?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.701
Yeah.
Can't believe it, man.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.912
Every... Yeah,
everyone's doing great, man.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.580
-I can't complain.
-Yeah?

00:38.664 --> 00:40.123
What you been up to?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.667
Uh, just still out speaking.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.794
Uh, teaching the <i>Hoop Dreams</i>
educational curriculum

00:43.877 --> 00:45.712
to high school students and, uh,

00:45.796 --> 00:48.298
still trying to get my clothing line
a licensing deal,

00:48.382 --> 00:49.424
-you know?
-Yeah.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.843
Have you done any coaching,
high school coaching?

00:51.927 --> 00:53.887
- Oh. Staying away from coaching.
- No?

00:53.971 --> 00:57.224
I think, I... If I ever coached
high school, I'd probably be fired.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.269
-For what?
-For probably hitting a kid in his head.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.980
'Cause kids, nowadays, for real,
they talk back to you, like,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.066
"Oh, I'm not coming to class,
and I still think I'm supposed to play."

01:06.149 --> 01:07.859
-Well, not on this team.
-Yeah.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.778
"Well, yes, I am.
Uh, you need me."

01:09.861 --> 01:11.029
No, no, I don't need you.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.949
I'll play with the last guy at the bench.
You know what I'm saying?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.117
Yeah.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.868
So, what, you know,
a lot of these kids now, they...

01:16.952 --> 01:20.247
Favoritisms, and, you know,
the fundamentals of the game,

01:20.330 --> 01:22.082
they done lost it.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.334
So, coaching?
Me, I stay away from it.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.670
Now, teaching, yes.
I teach the game to kids.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.255
Yeah.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.199
You ever see this?
That logo?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.868
Um...

01:57.951 --> 02:01.413
I don't know this logo,
but it looks like a Don't Fret design.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.624
This artist does some stuff
around the city.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.584
-Cool. Cool.
-Yeah.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.753
So, I was at this party last night,

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
and, uh, some guy
brought that for us to taste,

02:10.756 --> 02:12.591
-and it's pretty good.
-Yeah?

02:12.674 --> 02:16.595
But, uh, what made him interesting to me
was he was telling us that...

02:16.678 --> 02:18.597
apparently it's some kind
of underground brewery,

02:18.680 --> 02:22.059
which is something I've never heard
of before, and that it's illegal.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.810
You wanna bust up their operation?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.730
And then you're gonna start
your own brewery?

02:26.813 --> 02:29.066
- No, you know--
- I work for you. Let's do it.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.152
No, no, the...
You know, I think there's a story,

02:32.235 --> 02:35.322
and, uh, I'd like you to try
to get inside it and tell the story.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.032
Okay. So...

02:38.617 --> 02:41.370
Where is it? Who is it?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.372
- Well--
- When is it happening?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.248
That's the rub.
I don't know.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.459
The, uh, the guy who brought it, though,

02:47.542 --> 02:50.420
I think he said he worked at Dark Matter,
which is some coffee place.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.130
- I'll get on it.
- All right.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.757
Yeah.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.783
-Hey, how's it going?
-It's going all right. How you doing, man?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.743
-Good. I'm Matt.
-Matt, Jason. Nice to meet you.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.953
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.121
Uh, how'd you hear about us?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.455
I heard about it from a friend, man.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.915
-All right, cool, man. Well, come on in.
-Yeah.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.167
We got three beers on tap.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.710
All right, thank you.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.255
And, dude, we're, uh, we're fermenting
this awesome brown ale right now.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.673
Come back in a couple weeks.
Check it out.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.091
-Yeah? All right.
-Thanks. You guys are the best.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.592
-Yes! Enjoy.
-Thank you.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.885
How much do I
owe you for the beer?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.804
Um, you know what?
This one's on the house.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.347
-Appreciate it. Thank you, man.
-Yeah? Absolutely.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.516
So, here's my card.
Just, uh, hit me up some time.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.726
-We'll do a story.
-Yeah.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.811
-Yeah? Bye.
-All right. Take care. Drive safe.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.741
Who was that?

04:00.824 --> 04:03.952
He's actually this, uh...
He's a reporter from... from <i>New City.</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:06.329
That guy's from <i>New City?</i>
What did he want?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.998
Uh, he just wanted
to check out the brewery.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.166
And what did...
what did you say?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.001
-Did... did you tell him anything?
-Relax.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.211
No. Dude, this isn't good
that he knows we exist, man.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.671
That's...

04:14.755 --> 04:17.716
Babe, have you...
have you met Lee and Megan?

04:17.799 --> 04:19.342
- No.
- They're both at Half Acre.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.803
Oh, you guys are at Half Acre?
Hey, Jeff. It's nice to meet you guys.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.597
He's one of the brewers,
and she's the assistant.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.806
I can't believe
we haven't met before.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.059
- Yeah. And you're the assistant tap...
- Tap room manager.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.311
Awesome. Awesome.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.188
-Yeah, awesome.
-Dude, we love your guys' shit.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.482
Like, seriously,
you fucking inspire us.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.066
- That's true.
- He's the one that brews it.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.820
If we don't talk to him,
if we fucking cut this guy out,

04:38.904 --> 04:41.198
he's got no story, right?
What's he gonna say?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.449
Whatever he wants.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.659
Exact... But what, like, what?
"Oh, hey, there's this--"

04:44.743 --> 04:46.745
"There's an illegal brewery
happening down here.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.080
It's all the rage.
Everybody's talking about it.

04:49.164 --> 04:53.084
Um, those growlers
you're seeing with the Don't Fret logo,

04:53.168 --> 04:55.086
that's... that's where it is.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.379
It's so and so."

04:56.463 --> 05:01.510
At least if we play ball with him,
we can kind of control the message.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.346
If we play ball with him, you...
you do realize, like, this is done.

05:04.429 --> 05:08.099
Whatever we have here,
this is, like... no more.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.893
Nothing lasts forever, buddy.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.062
-You know? Like, come on.
-It feels like we just started.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.313
- If we're gonna--
- What do...

05:13.396 --> 05:16.024
Eh, we started a while ago.
It's time.

05:16.107 --> 05:21.780
We could expand to ten times this capacity
in a month if we wanted to.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.366
Can we clean up?
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.326
-Yeah. It's fine, man. Hey. Just, like...
-Okay.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.912
Let's just go look at some spaces, right?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.038
Let's, let's just drop...

05:30.121 --> 05:32.123
Let's just go look at spaces
so we cover our asses, right?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.208
Okay, all right. Let's just...

05:33.291 --> 05:34.334
- Let's just...
- Can you grab the...

05:34.417 --> 05:36.670
Yes, of course.
But, you know...

05:37.587 --> 05:40.298
I just don't wanna see us
get fucked. That's all.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.054
I think... he would be
willing to help us out.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.180
Okay.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.849
All right. I'll take 'em.

05:51.476 --> 05:55.230
Were you guys trying to have a baby,
or did it sort of just happen?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.274
Oh, yeah.
No, we were trying.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.320
We tried for a couple months...

06:02.404 --> 06:05.782
and, you know,
I actually think I know the exact day...

06:05.865 --> 06:07.450
-Really?
-...he was conceived.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.952
Yes, I do.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.996
It was a special moment.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.540
Were you nervous
when you ended up finding out?

06:13.623 --> 06:14.624
Uh, yeah.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.876
But I was also nervous
that I couldn't get pregnant

06:16.960 --> 06:20.338
'cause you don't really know
if you've never had a baby.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.967
-But you wanted to be a mom, then?
-Yeah, I've always wanted to be a mom.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.220
I mean, we'll see how good I do,
but...

06:28.096 --> 06:29.180
I like this guy.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.309
Oh, it's pretty.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.978
And we will be following up with you
as soon as everything arrives

06:35.061 --> 06:36.354
-to set up delivery.
-Great.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.524
And if I could just have you
swipe and follow the prompt.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.696
- Okey-dokey. Perfect.
- Great. Thank you so much.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.324
No problem.
You guys are all set. Congratulations.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.200
Thank you.
Have a good day.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.997
I forgot to tell you I talked to, uh,
that guy Jason from <i>New City</i> today.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.082
-Oh, wow.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.001
-I didn't know you were talking with him.
-Yeah.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.212
He seems to think that there's...
there's a story there...

07:02.088 --> 07:04.174
-which is great.
-Wow. That's amazing.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.302
I didn't think that was gonna happen.
I thought Jeff was totally against it.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.139
Well... you know,
he'll come around.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.099
It's fine.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.435
You haven't talked to him about it?

07:16.895 --> 07:19.397
I mean, initially I did,
but, you know,

07:19.481 --> 07:23.652
he just doesn't see it
for the opportunity it is yet, that's all.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.030
Actually, I think what Jason's
most interested in, obviously,

07:27.113 --> 07:30.367
is, like, the...
the family element to the brewery,

07:30.450 --> 07:34.204
so... you know,
eventually he's gonna wanna talk to Jeff.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.748
I just have to, sort of,
prep him for it.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.169
Yeah, but shouldn't he be
on board to start with?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.462
Or else the article's...

07:42.545 --> 07:44.464
If he wants to focus on the family
and wants to talk to Jeff,

07:44.547 --> 07:47.634
and Jeff doesn't wanna talk to him,
that's kind of a problem, right?

07:47.717 --> 07:48.760
We'll see.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.722
You're just so cool about it.
It'll all work out.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.932
I'm the uptight one.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.687
I just think secrets
aren't very good in family,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.398
as we learned from the beginning
of this little venture.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.359
Oh. I love you.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.152
I love you, too.
I'm not mad.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.071
I... I just think you should talk to him.
That's all.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.406
Okay. I... I will.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.663
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.206
Hey, you okay?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.500
Uh...

08:22.544 --> 08:23.586
Yeah. I'm sorry.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.255
I think I just, like...

08:26.172 --> 08:29.134
I don't know.
Kimmie was doing fireballs,

08:29.217 --> 08:30.844
and I did some, too...

08:31.928 --> 08:34.014
but I didn't think I took this many.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.434
He was getting so far down the line
with... with these ideas and, like...

08:37.517 --> 08:38.643
- Yeah.
- It just...

08:38.727 --> 08:42.981
It made me, you know, it made me anxious.
It made me feel kind of betrayed

08:43.064 --> 08:45.900
that he hadn't talked about
any of this with me before, you know?

08:45.984 --> 08:48.486
If we went any bigger than what
we're doing right now, okay...

08:48.570 --> 08:50.613
-Mmm-hmm.
-...there's just, there's compromise,

08:50.697 --> 08:51.823
you know?
There is. Just...

08:51.906 --> 08:54.409
That's the way it is.
And so, like... like, let's say...

08:54.492 --> 08:56.995
let's say we looked at these spaces
like Matt wants to, right?

08:57.078 --> 08:58.663
-Yeah.
-And we took one over.

08:58.747 --> 09:02.292
Like, to be able to... to maintain that,
you need a lot of money.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.918
-And so, like--
-I don't know, I'm just saying, like...

09:04.002 --> 09:06.713
I feel like... Look, hey,
I don't wanna stress you out. Okay?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.214
No, it's fine. Just...
You know what? Trust me.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.799
-I'm here for you. Like, that's--
-I'm... I know.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.260
And I wanna... I wanna hear
your thoughts. And it's, like...

09:12.343 --> 09:14.971
It's actually very interesting to me
to hear what you're thinking,

09:15.055 --> 09:17.766
and I wanna know because I love you
and I trust you more than anything, so...

09:17.849 --> 09:18.892
Yeah.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.436
I just... I just think,
don't make it a no.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.645
You know what I mean?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.814
-Like, just keep it open, and like--
-Yeah, I will.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.316
I...

09:26.399 --> 09:29.360
I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep an open mind.
I'm not saying no.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.488
-Come here. Come here.
-I just feel...

09:33.281 --> 09:35.575
- I love you. Okay?
- I love you.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.836
It's a two-brother operation,
so if I only talk to...

09:46.920 --> 09:47.962
You know, you're right.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.047
-...one.
-I didn't even think about that.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.173
'Cause he was more like,

09:50.256 --> 09:51.883
you know, you can just
talk for the both of us, but...

09:51.966 --> 09:53.426
-Yeah.
-...that makes a lot of sense,

09:53.510 --> 09:54.844
so... so why don't we do this?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.221
Why don't, uh...

09:56.304 --> 09:58.681
Why don't we set up a phone call,
like, in the next, like,

09:58.765 --> 10:00.350
you know, say,
like, next week sometime?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.976
-Uh...
-Does that sound good? I know--

10:02.060 --> 10:03.186
-No, no.
-Uh, I just--

10:03.269 --> 10:04.437
-No. No.
-No.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.732
Just wanna talk to both of you.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.776
-I know. Yeah, I would love that.
-If I don't--

10:09.859 --> 10:11.319
I'm telling you, I... I wish...

10:11.402 --> 10:13.363
I wish I could sort of force
his hand on the thing,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.115
but he's, uh...

10:15.198 --> 10:16.908
-He's a little difficult sometimes, so...
-Yeah.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.034
So, um...

10:18.118 --> 10:20.411
Can he do a Skype interview
or something like that?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.330
-Yeah. You know what?
-We could Skype or FaceTime?

10:22.413 --> 10:24.582
Why don't we figure that out?
Why don't we just get this part done?

10:24.666 --> 10:26.251
And then after we get in here,
we can chat it out.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.837
And then I'll make sure that,
you know, before you leave,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.797
we'll... we'll try to set something up
on the books, you know?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.298
-All right. All right.
-All right? Sound like a plan?

10:32.382 --> 10:34.425
-That sounds like a flake.
-Let's, uh, let's head in.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.636
Oh, come on.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.887
<i>So, you're the financial guy.</i>

10:37.971 --> 10:41.599
What... what do you forecast for
the company over the next five, ten years?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.143
What's next?

10:43.226 --> 10:49.315
Well, honestly, we just started this
because we loved doing something together,

10:49.399 --> 10:50.608
and we loved, like I said,

10:50.692 --> 10:54.154
watching people enjoy something
that we were able to... to produce.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.657
But I... I would be lying
if I didn't say I...

10:57.740 --> 11:02.036
We've all imagined the company
growing larger, and bigger,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.706
-and becoming something more substantial.
-Hmm.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.667
And we've... I've actually started
looking at some spaces

11:07.750 --> 11:12.547
that we would be able to move
this operation into a larger scale, and...

11:12.630 --> 11:14.549
-Make some big money.
-Well, you know, we'll see.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.928
But we can definitely, uh,
apply what we've learned in this garage...

11:19.012 --> 11:21.598
-Yeah.
-...and expand to, uh,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
the greater Chicago area.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.769
We could definitely, in time, uh...

11:26.853 --> 11:29.480
I don't see why we couldn't
be a national company.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.636
Hey, what's up, Jeff?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.430
What's up, man?
Um, are you... are you busy?

12:02.513 --> 12:05.224
So just, like, as...
as you really grow,

12:05.308 --> 12:09.062
like, how do you... how do you maintain,
like, the quality of everything,

12:09.145 --> 12:11.856
you know, as you're doing this
in the... for the masses?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.191
You know? It's like...

12:13.274 --> 12:15.026
What...
To maintain, like... How...

12:15.109 --> 12:17.028
The reason why
you initially started this.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.405
Right. It used to be
a handful of us saying,

12:19.489 --> 12:20.698
"Hey, this is, like, the best coffee.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.700
This is the best
that this can possibly be."

12:22.784 --> 12:23.826
-Right.
-And then you...

12:23.910 --> 12:24.994
you quickly learn,
as you grow up,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.997
that you're a small fraction
of an opinion or a palate,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.791
so we started creating systems

12:29.874 --> 12:33.336
and, like, having all of our baristas
at our different stores

12:33.419 --> 12:34.796
score these same coffees.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.922
-Right.
-And that way,

12:36.005 --> 12:39.008
we could turn around and actually have
blind assessments of...

12:39.092 --> 12:41.219
Hey, this is, you know... seven...

12:41.302 --> 12:43.596
Seventeen people
said this coffee was terrible.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.014
- Sure, sure.
- And then I said it was great.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
-Right, right.
-Well, maybe I'm, uh...

12:47.183 --> 12:49.560
-Maybe I need to get humbled...
-Yeah.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.814
...and realize that 17 people
are probably more intelligent than me.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.482
That makes sense.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.609
What about, like,
you know, experimentation?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.735
You know, like, do you...

12:57.819 --> 13:00.738
do you feel like you can still kind of
push the boundaries and try new shit?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.574
Or do you feel like you
have to kind of please the masses?

13:03.658 --> 13:07.537
More than ever, I think we can do
weirder shit than we've ever done.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.038
You...
Now more than ever?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.332
Yeah. I mean,
we got more talent on the team.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.168
We've got, you know,
more money to play with things.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.295
But, you know, it's like, um...

13:16.379 --> 13:18.256
some of this, like,
cask conditioning stuff.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.384
We've been doing
pressure infusions of coffees that,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.094
you know, we couldn't have done that

13:23.177 --> 13:25.972
back when we were trying
to make sure everyone got paid.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.391
This thing is huge.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.020
I really hope my baby is not this big.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.814
Ow. Okay.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.024
Yeah.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.318
Just line it up and then...

13:40.737 --> 13:42.071
Perfect.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.365
-You wanna match up the thing?
-I'm sorry. Right. I'm sorry.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.701
You okay?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.456
Yeah, um, I'm just not feeling so good.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.582
Sorry.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.876
Oh, that's okay. Is it tummy?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.377
Yes. Yeah.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.879
If you go into the bathroom,

13:57.962 --> 13:59.172
-right there...
-Uh-huh.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.090
...under the sink,
I have anti-nausea medication.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.258
-Okay. Can I...
-Yeah, yeah.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.426
-Yeah? Okay.
-Just take a little.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.720
-I'm gonna be right... You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.013
Okay.
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.473
I'm fine.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.144
I'm... not fine.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.125
Well, we would be able to put
a water filtration system

14:36.209 --> 14:37.502
- in here, and be able to...
- Yeah. It's...

14:37.585 --> 14:39.128
- build-to-suit. So, yeah.
- Great.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.588
Definitely, for sure.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.007
Um, just... thanks a lot.
Just give me one second.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.217
- Yeah.
- I need to check with him, okay?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.468
-Mmm-hmm.
-Thanks.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.345
What's up, man?
What are you doing?

14:47.428 --> 14:49.639
Uh, texting.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.225
Well, do you wanna, uh...

14:53.434 --> 14:55.103
You wanna come take part
in the conversation?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.106
Seems, uh, seems like you got it covered.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.318
Okay. Uh, you got any questions
or anything? Like...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.612
Yes.
What are we doing here, man?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.491
- We're just looking at spaces.
- I know, but...

15:10.660 --> 15:11.953
What? Are you gonna be like this all day?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.955
You're just gonna, like,
lean against walls and be mopey?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.540
Dude, come on, man.
I'm here.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.125
You asked me to be here.
I'm here.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
Could you try a little bit?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.465
Attaboy. There you go.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.592
Uh, Sylvia? I think we're ready
to go see another space.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.388
So we are coming in at about half
the square footage of the last place.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.598
So this is 10,000 square feet.

15:32.682 --> 15:36.769
A... fixer-upper,
but it's got tons of personality.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.605
It fits within the parameters
we talked about for sure.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.485
Okay. Thank you. This is, uh...

15:44.569 --> 15:46.737
Dude...

15:48.072 --> 15:49.115
I like it.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.616
Fuck, man, I didn't think
I was gonna say that,

15:50.700 --> 15:54.036
but I could actually wrap
my head around this, man.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.331
This would just take way too much work.
This is... this is...

15:57.415 --> 15:58.458
Dude.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.501
It's a money pit, man. We're not...
This isn't a real option.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.212
Dude, listen. I'm saying
what you've been wanting me to say.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.506
I can... I can get behind this,
all right?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.008
That's good. That's great, man.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.218
No. Yeah, we'll find the right place.
But that's...

16:09.302 --> 16:10.803
Sylvia, thank you so much.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.139
This is, uh, very cool, but...

16:13.222 --> 16:14.348
- Okay.
- Uh, unfortunately...

16:14.432 --> 16:16.392
I just don't think this one's gonna work.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.311
Hey, sweetie,
you doing okay in there?

16:21.814 --> 16:22.857
Noelle?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.276
Hey, hey, hey.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.944
What's wrong?
What happened?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.655
Nothing. I'm sorry.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.741
It's okay. Come here.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.666
You know how many fucking garages
we could fit in this space?

16:40.750 --> 16:41.918
-Let's just take...
-A lot.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.419
...a little leap.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.296
That's hard enough for me as is,

16:45.379 --> 16:47.757
you know that,
to take this small leap.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.885
This is fucking beyond
anything I can comprehend.

16:50.968 --> 16:55.056
I... I know it looks corporate
because of the size of the place

16:55.139 --> 16:58.059
-and the fluorescent lighting, but--
-'Cause it's next to a fucking mall?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.269
Is that part of the reason
it looks corporate?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.314
Is that what we wanna do?
We wanna be the brewery next to the mall?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.857
There's a lot of foot traffic.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.609
It's not a bad thing
that it's next to a mall.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.402
That's the
foot traffic we want?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.905
The guys who are going to fucking Kohl's?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.908
We want them to go from Kohl's
and just mosey on over here, and--

17:13.991 --> 17:15.701
Oh, don't be pretentious
about your...

17:15.785 --> 17:17.662
you know,
what your clientele is, okay?

17:17.745 --> 17:19.789
-You just want people to buy your beer...
-See, I don't.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.332
-...so--
-That... that's not how I feel.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.001
That's not how I feel, okay?
I don't want just anyone to buy our beer.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.295
I don't wanna just have anyone
in here, okay?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.465
That's... All right, we're just...
We're not gonna solve anything. I just...

17:29.549 --> 17:32.093
-Could we sleep on it?
-Yeah. Let's sleep on it, okay?

17:33.261 --> 17:35.346
- Don't do that, man.
- Don't...

17:35.429 --> 17:38.266
We can kind of see
if there's any possibility

17:38.349 --> 17:42.019
of a story that we might do when
the Beard Awards are in the city,

17:42.103 --> 17:45.231
with a title like,
"Who Cares About the Beard Awards?"

17:45.314 --> 17:47.108
or, "Does Anybody Care
About the Beard Awards?"

17:47.191 --> 17:50.278
or, "What Awards...
Do Awards Really Matter to People?"

17:50.361 --> 17:53.114
I think that's an idea that it could be...

17:53.197 --> 17:54.740
- Well, see--
- ...pardon the pun, very meaty?

17:54.824 --> 17:58.494
- Or it could be, you know...
- Vegetabley.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.371
-Or it could be thin, thin gruel.
-Thin gruel.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.831
I've been trying
to get in touch with Jeff.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.957
Matt keeps talking to me,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.209
but Jeff has been impossible
to get in touch with.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.129
I've hit him up online,
I've stopped by his job,

18:08.212 --> 18:09.255
I hit up his...

18:09.338 --> 18:11.340
ex on Facebook.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.633
It's just, I don't know,

18:12.717 --> 18:14.260
and I don't think he wants
to talk to me for the story.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.137
All right, well, keep at it.
You gotta get 'em both.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.264
I know, it just helps the story
to have both of 'em,

18:18.347 --> 18:20.016
but it's just been...

18:20.099 --> 18:21.809
I don't think
he wants to be a part of it.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.227
-Yeah. Well, we need 'em both.
-Yeah.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.062
'Cause that's the story, right?
It's the family thing, so...

18:25.146 --> 18:26.272
-All right. I'm on it.
-All right. Keep at it.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.107
-All right. Later.
-Let me know. Bye. Take care.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.900
Let's just drink our beers.
Let's not talk about it.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.235
-I didn't even say anything yet.
-Is that okay?

18:31.319 --> 18:34.363
I know, I know, I just...
Let's just not go down that road, please.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.491
I was just gonna say that, like...

18:38.367 --> 18:41.037
Like, look at this fucking place.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.163
It's...

18:42.246 --> 18:44.624
Tell me... tell me you couldn't
see us in a place like this.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.334
This place is fuckin' cool, yes.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.627
-Yeah, it is.
-Yeah, I know, I know.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.878
-And it's big.
-Yes.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.004
That's all I was saying.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.881
I get it for you, man,
it's like you have this...

18:51.964 --> 18:53.758
You have a boring job that you hate,

18:53.841 --> 18:55.760
you know, and, like,
making the transition to,

18:55.843 --> 18:59.096
like, running a fucking brewery,
that's a no-brainer. All right?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.181
But, like...

19:00.264 --> 19:02.516
And I don't want this to come across
the wrong way, all right?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.478
But for me, it's like, I love my life.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.188
And I know I'm very fortunate
to be able to say that,

19:07.271 --> 19:10.650
but, like, I... I love...
I love working at Dark Matter, man.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.195
I love...
I love my shitty garage brewery,

19:14.278 --> 19:15.780
and I... I love my girlfriend, man.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.407
And I love that I get to fucking
spend time with her.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.534
And I'm not... I'm not trying to
throw that in your face, okay?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.036
-No... you're right. No...
-But I just, I...

19:22.119 --> 19:24.330
When I think about all that,
I don't know why I would...

19:24.413 --> 19:26.374
I would give that up to, like...

19:26.457 --> 19:28.709
to work more
and to fucking stress more.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.378
-I hear all that.
-Okay.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.505
And you're right. My job fucking sucks.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.839
-And you're absolutely right.
-Right, I...

19:33.923 --> 19:35.716
Look, man, I just...

19:35.800 --> 19:38.678
I just know that you have
so much fucking potential.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.804
That's all.

19:39.887 --> 19:43.015
And even if you try
to stay in the same place,

19:43.099 --> 19:45.267
everything around you
is gonna change,

19:45.351 --> 19:48.104
and everything you think is cool now
isn't gonna be cool in...

19:48.187 --> 19:49.730
whenever it's not cool.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.984
And I just wanna watch you grow
while everyone else around you grows.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.445
That's all. That's all it is, man.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.406
I just wanna see you
finally get rewarded.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.033
You're fucking good
at everything you do,

20:01.117 --> 20:04.036
and you have great people around you,
and that's not an accident.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.539
And I just want to see you
fucking get rewarded for it. That's it.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.207
-Okay. Okay. And you've said it, man.
-And I've had it--

20:08.290 --> 20:10.292
- I did. I said it, and now...
- I'm processing it.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.711
You've said it and I've heard it,
and let's--

20:11.794 --> 20:13.087
-I'm gonna piss my pants...
-You do that.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.339
-...if I don't get up right now.
-Please, get the fuck out of here.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.549
- All right.
- Go. Go.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.800
Jesus.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.785
- Can I get you something?
- Uh, yes.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.037
- I will have another TV Party, please.
- Okay.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.247
Thank you.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.466
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.472
What the fuck?

21:08.642 --> 21:10.227
Fucking asshole.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.607
Fuck.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.153
Nah. Come on. One more.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.239
Hey, your, uh, your buddy
from <i>New City</i> texted you.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.699
You're unbelievable, man.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.662
You needed the push.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.666
You're welcome.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.134
- Babe.
- Hey, babe.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.179
You won't fucking believe my night.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.516
Matt fucked the brewery.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.730
Whoa.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.901
What's going on?

22:03.531 --> 22:05.407
You okay?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.285
Talk to me.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.873
I'm pregnant.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.795
What?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.589
I took a test today.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.029
Hey. No. Okay.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.322
Jeff!

24:08.405 --> 24:09.573
It's cold as fuck out there.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.825
-How you doing, man?
-I'm, uh, I'm okay.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.161
-Jason from <i>New City.</i>
-Yeah. I know.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.871
-Been talking with your brother.
-Yeah.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.498
-Been trying to get a hold of you.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.375
-It's been very tough.
-Here I am.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.085
You're a hard person
to get a hold of.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.045
Yeah. Um...

24:23.128 --> 24:24.922
-Do you want a beer?
-I would love a beer.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.131
Yeah?

24:26.715 --> 24:27.925
Look, can we talk?

24:28.926 --> 24:30.469
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.305
Your brother keeps talking to me.
Why won't you talk to me?

24:36.517 --> 24:38.435
I don't know, man, um...

24:38.519 --> 24:41.563
My brother and I
are very different people.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.149
Mmm, give me some of that.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.069
Mmm.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.282
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.618
Hi.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.078
- Hey.
- Welcome.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.330
-Hi, beautiful.
-Hi. How are you?

24:58.414 --> 24:59.456
Mmm...

24:59.540 --> 25:00.582
Hey, man.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.334
Oh, have a seat.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.919
I will if I can.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.172
-Looks really good.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.716
You're gonna be
a great fucking dad.

25:08.799 --> 25:09.800
How you doing?

25:09.883 --> 25:10.884
Yeah, we'll see.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.969
I'm okay.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.053
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.388
Listen, dude.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.806
We just kinda
sat and talked through...

25:15.889 --> 25:18.559
If, uh, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it together.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.186
All right? No more... no more
bullshit behind my back, okay?

25:21.270 --> 25:22.312
- Yeah.
- Good.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.690
So I feel kinda crazy, but...

25:24.773 --> 25:26.400
- That's totally normal...
- I promise, man.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.777
Okay. All right.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.195
Hey, I'm excited.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.363
Yeah.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.948
Uh, who, uh, who wants a beer?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.451
- That's my cue.
- I do.
