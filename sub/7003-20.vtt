WEBVTT

00:00.733 --> 00:02.300
All right.

00:02.301 --> 00:05.303
I'm gonna show you
how to do a reversal
from the down position.

00:05.304 --> 00:07.872
I'm gonna pin you
in about three seconds.

00:07.873 --> 00:11.977
That's real fair, dad.
You weigh like a ton
more than me.

00:11.978 --> 00:16.047
A ton? Ok, if that's not fair,
why don't I just take on
all three of you?

00:16.047 --> 00:17.348
All right!

00:19.351 --> 00:21.720
Come on, you bunch
of little girls.

00:24.590 --> 00:27.425
1, 2, 3! You're pinned!
You lose!

00:27.426 --> 00:29.427
Yeah, but...

00:29.428 --> 00:33.064
Not the second round!
No!

00:33.065 --> 00:37.135
Dad, it smells under here!
Seriously!

00:37.136 --> 00:39.671
It's the tim taylor
half-smelly-nelson!

00:41.206 --> 00:44.242
Yeah, dad. Your pits
are the pits!

00:44.243 --> 00:48.312
Hi, guys. I see he's got you
in that half-smelly-nelson.

00:49.649 --> 00:52.050
How'd you know?

00:52.051 --> 00:54.886
He perfected it on me.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.155
Boys, aren't you supposed
to be doing homework?

00:57.156 --> 00:59.791
I was until dad
called us down to wrestle.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.793
Tim...

01:01.794 --> 01:04.729
You won't wrestle with me
anymore, iguana woman.
Come on.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.032
Hey, just put
the groceries away,
ape man.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.667
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:12.304 --> 01:14.539
Bite-size pretzels...

01:14.540 --> 01:18.276
Bite-size quiche. Darling.

01:18.277 --> 01:21.279
Bite-size pizza.
Who's coming over,
the bite-size family?

01:21.280 --> 01:25.950
I told you, I'm
giving a baby shower
for linda from work.

01:25.951 --> 01:28.019
Linda. Her husband's
the crook?

01:28.020 --> 01:30.955
He's not a crook.
He's a cook.

01:30.956 --> 01:33.158
We went to his restaurant.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.994
That's right. I paid
the bill. He's a crook.

01:35.995 --> 01:38.063
Anyway,
it's at 2:00 on Saturday,

01:38.064 --> 01:40.899
And a lot of people from work
are gonna be there.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.601
You mean
a lot of people people
or a lot of women people?

01:43.602 --> 01:45.770
Women people.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.506
They're just like men people,
only they have longer hair,
and they're smarter.

01:50.475 --> 01:52.476
Bunch of women
at a baby shower,

01:52.477 --> 01:57.716
Yakking about stretch marks,
bloating, labor pains...

01:57.717 --> 02:02.286
I wanna discuss labor pains,
I'll talk to a union man.

02:02.287 --> 02:04.422
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

02:04.423 --> 02:07.325
Why don't you pop your head in
and say hi for a second?

02:07.326 --> 02:10.061
I really want you to meet
my women friends from work.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.130
Can't this Saturday.
Why not?

02:12.131 --> 02:15.333
I'm busy on Saturday.
We're doing that <i>tool time</i>
till 2:00.

02:15.334 --> 02:17.769
And I told the boys
I'd rush back here

02:17.770 --> 02:19.771
And take them
to the demolition derby
at four.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.940
Well, there's two hours
in between there.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.341
Well, then I go upstairs.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.576
To do what?

02:25.577 --> 02:27.311
Upstairs stuff.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.484
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:43.055 --> 03:45.423
Does everybody know
what time it is?

03:45.424 --> 03:47.358
<i>(all)</i> tool time!

03:47.359 --> 03:49.393
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

03:49.394 --> 03:51.329
Tim "the tool man" taylor.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.202
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

03:57.203 --> 03:59.603
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor.

03:59.604 --> 04:03.174
Thank you, heidi.
Poor little al's out sick today.

04:03.175 --> 04:05.543
But don't have
a flannel meltdown.

04:05.544 --> 04:09.314
He's gonna
be helping us out by phone.
Heidi, my al phone, please.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.919
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.589
He's looking
pretty sprightly,
isn't he?

04:18.589 --> 04:21.759
Al, you there?
<i>Ahchoo!</i>

04:21.760 --> 04:25.196
Use a tissue, fella.
Come on!

04:25.197 --> 04:28.199
<i>I would like</i>
<i>the audience to know</i>
<i>that I used a hanky.</i>

04:31.136 --> 04:33.838
This is the first time
you've been out sick,
isn't it?

04:33.839 --> 04:35.340
<i>Which is amazing,</i>

04:35.341 --> 04:38.943
<i>Considering all the injuries</i>
<i>you've inflicted on me.</i>

04:38.944 --> 04:40.879
<i>Put your hand down, tim.</i>

04:42.681 --> 04:45.416
Anyway, today we continue
our week-long salute...

04:45.417 --> 04:48.019
<i>(drain gurgling)</i>

04:48.020 --> 04:50.621
...To plumbing.

04:50.622 --> 04:53.291
And joining us today
is master plumber felix myman.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.659
Let's give him a big
<i>tool time</i> welcome.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.733
Good to have you aboard,
felix.
Nice to be here, tim.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.136
Felix and I
go way back, right?

05:05.137 --> 05:09.807
That's right. I've been
to your house for all of
your plumbing disasters.

05:09.808 --> 05:13.211
The water heater,
the dishwasher,
jill's bathtub...

05:13.212 --> 05:14.812
I think we get the point.

05:14.813 --> 05:18.383
Anyway, we'll try to get...
<i>(al snorts and snickers)</i>

05:24.924 --> 05:26.891
Being a master plumber,

05:26.892 --> 05:29.627
Felix is experienced
with all sorts
of bathroom problems -

05:29.628 --> 05:31.629
Sinks, showers...

05:31.630 --> 05:34.165
Speaking of showers,
what do you think
of baby showers?

05:34.166 --> 05:37.969
I'm against them. I think
babies should take baths.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.071
No, it's a different
sort of shower.

05:40.072 --> 05:42.140
It's like when
women get together

05:42.141 --> 05:45.243
And yap about what to do
when their water breaks.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.345
With any kind
of water breakage,

05:47.346 --> 05:50.114
You wanna call
a licensed plumber.

05:58.790 --> 06:02.060
The first segment
of our plumbing show
will start in the bathroom,

06:02.061 --> 06:04.429
Where all the
action takes place,
right on the throne.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.298
We're talking about
a sweaty toilet. Heidi,
my sweaty toilet, please.

06:10.635 --> 06:12.636
Here you are, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

06:12.637 --> 06:13.704
You're welcome.

06:13.705 --> 06:16.307
Now, what is
a sweaty toilet?

06:16.308 --> 06:19.444
Is it a toilet
that's just overstressed
from too many seat-ups?

06:19.445 --> 06:22.981
Oh! Oh! Oh!

06:22.982 --> 06:24.548
<i>I don't think so, tim.</i>

06:26.051 --> 06:28.052
Actually, tim,
this problem occurs

06:28.053 --> 06:30.621
When the cold water in the tank
cools the porcelain,

06:30.622 --> 06:33.524
And the warm, moist air
condenses on the sides.

06:33.525 --> 06:35.659
<i>Well said, felix.</i>

06:35.660 --> 06:37.895
<i>I'm glad there's</i>
<i>somebody there who knows</i>
<i>what he's talking about.</i>

06:37.896 --> 06:40.431
<i>I'm usually the one</i>
<i>that has to step in</i>
<i>and tell tim...</i>

06:40.432 --> 06:42.433
Talk to you later,
al.

06:42.434 --> 06:44.969
<i>(dial tone)</i>

06:44.970 --> 06:47.472
Ok, felix. What do we do
about a sweaty toilet?

06:47.473 --> 06:50.908
You
can install a tempering valve
to mix the hot and cold water

06:50.909 --> 06:52.877
Before it enters the tank.

06:52.878 --> 06:55.079
But that's for professional
installation only.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.415
For that,
hire a licensed plumber
like felix.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.083
For the do-it-yourselfer,

06:59.084 --> 07:03.221
You can just cement
foam liners inside the tank.

07:03.222 --> 07:06.024
You'll wanna drain the water
from the tank first

07:06.025 --> 07:08.626
And use an epoxy resin cement,

07:08.627 --> 07:11.062
Which will take
a couple of hours to dry.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.298
Yeah, but, felix,
when you gotta go,
you got to go.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.235
That's why I recommend

07:17.236 --> 07:20.304
Binford's
ultra-fast-drying
urethane adhesive.

07:20.305 --> 07:22.373
I'm not sure you wanna use
that kind of glue.

07:22.374 --> 07:26.744
I know what I'm doing here, ok?
Just wait till it's tacky...

07:26.745 --> 07:30.314
Tim, I'd be careful.
That's instant glue
you're using.

07:30.315 --> 07:34.519
It's not like instant instant.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.421
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

07:40.625 --> 07:43.461
Would you get that for me?
Oh, sure.

07:45.297 --> 07:47.698
Hello? Oh, hi, al.

07:47.699 --> 07:49.300
What does he want?

07:49.301 --> 07:53.003
He wants to know
if you've got your hands
glued to the toilet yet.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.141
Come on!

07:59.978 --> 08:05.483
<i>(all)</i> aw!

08:05.484 --> 08:08.986
I love these bootees.
They're darling.

08:08.987 --> 08:12.590
Ok. Anybody ready for cake?
<i>(all)</i> ohh!

08:12.591 --> 08:14.158
I'll help you.

08:14.159 --> 08:17.562
Ok. Hi, sweetie.
When did you get home?
I'm not home.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.763
Jill, is that
your husband?

08:19.764 --> 08:23.601
Tell 'em
I'm your latin lover miguel,
and I don't speak english.

08:23.602 --> 08:27.938
Yes, it is my husband.
Come and say hi.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.273
<i>Ihola!</i>

08:29.274 --> 08:33.611
Come and say hi
and don't act stupid.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.580
This is my husband tim.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.548
<i>(all)</i> hi.
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to our house.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.183
Um... Shower power!

08:40.184 --> 08:44.188
So, I finally get to meet
"the tool man."
yeah.

08:44.188 --> 08:46.790
You know, I watch your show
all the time.
Really?

08:46.791 --> 08:48.058
Yeah.
Who are you?

08:48.059 --> 08:51.729
Nora. I loved the one
on squeaky floors.

08:51.730 --> 08:54.232
"a squeak, a creak
or a... Ohhh!"

08:54.233 --> 08:56.234
A lot of people
liked that show.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.636
Yeah. Two letters
have already poured in.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.574
Jill, I hope you don't
mind me saying this,

09:03.575 --> 09:06.076
But I think tim
is even more handsome
in person

09:06.077 --> 09:08.146
Than he is on television.

09:08.147 --> 09:11.415
Well... Excuse me.
I don't mind.

09:11.416 --> 09:12.916
You are...?
Eve.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.053
Can I get you a cold drink,
some dip or a condominium?

09:18.023 --> 09:20.824
And - I'm just taking a shot -
you must be the guest of honor.

09:20.825 --> 09:23.727
Hi. I'm linda.
Can you join us, tim?

09:23.728 --> 09:27.632
Oh... I'm not
a big baby-shower guy.
I'm a big baby guy.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.568
Oh. I hope my husband
turns out to be a big baby guy.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.736
He's really nervous
right now.

09:32.737 --> 09:34.238
Here. I'll take these.
Thank you.

09:34.239 --> 09:36.274
Guys are generally
nervous about babies.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.909
You women do all the work,
and then we have to
sit back and think,

09:38.910 --> 09:41.912
"will I be
a good father to him?
Will he relate to me?"

09:41.913 --> 09:44.782
Or even worse, what if he
turns out to be a she?

09:44.783 --> 09:47.518
Then I have to protect she
from all the he's.

09:47.519 --> 09:51.822
You sound like
you've given this
a lot of thought.

09:51.823 --> 09:56.194
We had three boys.
They were babies once, and
they were really cool babies.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.396
I think men have
a lot in common with babies.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.666
We both get real cranky
if we don't get fed on time.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.801
We like to take naps
in the afternoon.

10:03.802 --> 10:07.171
And I don't know a guy
in the world that doesn't like
a good game of peek-a-boo.

10:09.641 --> 10:13.311
<i>(women)</i> ohh!

10:13.312 --> 10:15.346
This is a lot of fun.
I wish I could stay around.

10:15.347 --> 10:18.516
Have a nice shower
and have fun here.
Bye.

10:19.651 --> 10:21.252
What a doll.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.787
Jill, you are so lucky.

10:23.788 --> 10:27.024
That is exactly the kind of man
I've been looking for.

10:27.025 --> 10:28.759
He is fabulous.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.596
He is fabulous.
Who was that?

10:34.199 --> 10:36.567
This was a great shower,
jill. Thank you so much.

10:36.568 --> 10:39.303
You're welcome.
Here, I'll do that.

10:39.304 --> 10:43.073
I've put all your gifts
in the trunk. Where'd you get
that bib with the trough?

10:43.074 --> 10:45.075
It'd be perfect
for ball games.

10:45.076 --> 10:48.646
"that last beer
was a little too much
for me."

10:48.647 --> 10:50.948
I'm gonna take the boys
on an educational trip.

10:50.949 --> 10:52.383
Museum? Library?

10:52.384 --> 10:56.053
Actually, demolition derby.
Vroom-bam!

10:56.054 --> 10:58.789
He is so funny.
You must laugh all the time.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.658
All the time.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.562
Thanks again.
You be well.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.196
Bye.
Bye-bye.

11:06.197 --> 11:10.534
Here you go,
here you go.

11:10.535 --> 11:13.971
Thanks, mom.
Bye-bye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

11:13.972 --> 11:15.973
Yes!
See you later, honey.

11:15.974 --> 11:18.409
You! Wait.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.610
What?

11:19.611 --> 11:21.845
You were incredible
at that shower.

11:21.846 --> 11:25.249
You were funny
and charming and sexy.

11:25.250 --> 11:29.153
All the women wanted to be
married to you.

11:29.154 --> 11:31.822
I wanted to be married
to them, too.

11:33.692 --> 11:38.195
Maybe we could
work out some kind of
time-share arrangement.

11:38.196 --> 11:42.933
You know, sometimes
I just forget what an amazing
hunk of man you are.

11:42.934 --> 11:43.867
Ohh.

11:46.305 --> 11:51.074
Well, I'd love to stick around
and give you a little reminder,
but... The boys need me.

11:51.075 --> 11:52.276
I need you.

11:52.277 --> 11:55.012
<i>(car horn honks)</i>
ah!

11:55.013 --> 11:57.815
Demolition derby...
Sexy wife.

11:59.284 --> 12:02.219
Demolition derby...
Ooh, sexy wife.

12:03.588 --> 12:06.023
Could you hold that thought
till about 10:00 tonight?

12:06.024 --> 12:07.958
This thought here?

12:13.298 --> 12:15.899
That would...
That would be the one.
<i>(car horn honks)</i>

12:17.569 --> 12:18.902
Hurry back, mister.

12:20.806 --> 12:25.108
Every time I see two heaps
slam into one another tonight,
I'll be thinking about us.

12:36.388 --> 12:40.057
Honey, what a demolition derby.
I wish you'd been there.

12:40.058 --> 12:43.761
We were so close to the action,
you could taste the exhaust.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.830
I'm glad you're back.
Where are the boys?

12:45.831 --> 12:48.766
They're in their rooms.
Proud of those little guys.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.969
They each had one of those
52-ounce root beers.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.204
Randy let out a burp so loud,

12:54.205 --> 12:57.040
One of the drivers
thought he blew a tire.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.512
I always knew that
that boy was special.

13:01.513 --> 13:03.947
<i>(whistles)</i>
are you looking good.

13:03.948 --> 13:06.450
Let me get out of these
cruddy clothes.

13:06.451 --> 13:09.086
Don't take too long.
I won't.

13:10.555 --> 13:12.956
What a great night
with the boys, though.

13:12.957 --> 13:16.260
A lot of good food... Oh!

13:16.261 --> 13:17.595
Ah!

13:19.264 --> 13:23.534
Ohh! I got some
double-cheese nachos
sitting right here.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.470
<i>(burps)</i> ohh!

13:28.973 --> 13:30.140
Tim!

13:30.141 --> 13:32.042
Got a little gas ball
moving, moving...

13:32.043 --> 13:33.143
<i>(burps)</i>

13:34.913 --> 13:35.946
Ah!

13:35.947 --> 13:38.816
This is real attractive.

13:40.251 --> 13:42.953
So...

13:42.954 --> 13:44.855
Where were we?

13:47.726 --> 13:50.694
It's kinda hard
to remember.

13:51.863 --> 13:54.364
This'll refresh your memory.

13:54.365 --> 13:56.066
<i>(stifles burp)</i>

14:00.439 --> 14:01.939
Sorry.

14:06.177 --> 14:09.880
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Mark was right. Ohh.

14:09.881 --> 14:12.783
You shouldn't
have double onions
on those chili dogs.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.219
Hello...

14:25.497 --> 14:27.698
Where are you going?

14:27.699 --> 14:29.600
I've had enough.

14:29.601 --> 14:31.301
I thought we were gonna,
you know...

14:31.302 --> 14:34.271
Are you insane?

14:34.272 --> 14:36.574
You were drooling all over me
when I left.

14:36.575 --> 14:39.042
Yeah, well, that was
a different guy.

14:39.043 --> 14:44.682
What happened to the man
who was debonair and attractive
and oozing charm?

14:46.117 --> 14:49.854
That's me. I'm him.

14:49.855 --> 14:54.792
No, you're the guy that
burps and oozes something,
but it isn't charm.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.160
You were charming the pants
off those women today.

14:57.161 --> 14:59.563
Why don't you do that
with me anymore?

14:59.564 --> 15:01.799
I was just trying
to make a good impression.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.434
It really ticks me off that
just because we're married,

15:04.435 --> 15:08.138
Everybody else gets
the best part of you,
and I just get the rest.

15:08.139 --> 15:10.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:10.575 --> 15:13.076
Back the trolley up here
a minute.

15:13.077 --> 15:15.412
It's not like I get
the best o' jill.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.716
That morning breath could take
the paint off my hot rod.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.553
And how about this
little ratty robe?

15:22.554 --> 15:24.922
Like that says,
"come and take me,
big fella."

15:26.290 --> 15:29.827
The point is that tonight,
I really tried.

15:29.828 --> 15:33.163
When was the last time
that you put on something
like this for me?

15:34.599 --> 15:37.300
I put that on,
I'd be arrested, honey.

15:37.301 --> 15:39.236
Come on.

15:39.237 --> 15:41.939
All I wanted
was one night of romance,

15:41.940 --> 15:44.441
And you turn it
into a big argument.

15:44.442 --> 15:49.379
So let's not argue. I, for one,
am still in the mood.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.182
I'm taking a wild shot
that you're not.

15:55.020 --> 15:59.256
Ohh! Drat, drat, drat,
drat, drat.

15:59.257 --> 16:01.491
Problem, wilson?

16:01.492 --> 16:06.030
Well, tim, I am attempting
to balance an egg,

16:06.031 --> 16:08.265
But it's not easy.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.601
But if it falls,
it's overeasy.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:13.838 --> 16:15.839
You are quite the yolkster.

16:18.376 --> 16:22.546
Actually, tim, some people
believe that an egg
will stand on its end

16:22.547 --> 16:24.715
During the vernal equinox.

16:24.716 --> 16:26.784
The vernal what-nox?

16:26.785 --> 16:28.118
The vernal equinox, tim.

16:28.119 --> 16:30.353
It signifies
the first day of spring,

16:30.354 --> 16:32.656
It's when the sun
is directly over the equator

16:32.657 --> 16:35.793
And gravitational pull
is at its strongest.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.729
That's probably
what's affecting jill.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.731
What'd you do
this time, tim?

16:40.732 --> 16:44.301
I didn't do anything.
She's bent out of shape
because I'm too charming.

16:44.302 --> 16:49.707
You are quite the dazzler.
I don't see why that would
upset jill, though.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.843
She thinks I'm only charming
for other people and not her.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.345
Oh. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:55.346 --> 16:59.583
I think she wants things
to be like they were
when we first met.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.518
But I like the way
things are now.

17:01.519 --> 17:04.989
I like not always having
to impress the other person
or get dressed up.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.625
Mm-hmm. So you
would tend to agree
with j.B. Priestley,

17:07.626 --> 17:11.729
Who said that, "marriage
is like an endless visit
in your worst clothes."

17:11.730 --> 17:13.463
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:13.464 --> 17:15.799
That guy really knew
about marriage.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.969
And divorce, too.
He was married three times.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.137
Oh, no!

17:21.138 --> 17:23.507
Three mother-in-laws.
<i>(clucks)</i>

17:23.508 --> 17:25.474
<i>(laughs)</i>

17:25.476 --> 17:27.911
When jill and I
first got married,

17:27.912 --> 17:30.848
In order win her, I really
had to pour on the charm.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.583
Then she wanted to
see through the charm and
see if I really loved her.

17:33.584 --> 17:37.154
And now that she knows
I really love her,
she wants the charm back.

17:37.155 --> 17:41.391
Hmm. Well, tim,
maybe after 15 years
of marriage,

17:41.392 --> 17:46.363
Making an effort
to be more charming
has more meaning.

17:46.364 --> 17:48.398
Hmm. Yeah.

17:48.399 --> 17:51.969
It's too bad.
I like being comfortable
in my own house.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.539
If I've got a little gas,
I don't want to have to run out
to the backyard.

17:57.308 --> 17:59.543
I don't want that, either.

18:08.186 --> 18:10.420
Jill?
Hi.

18:11.823 --> 18:14.391
Hi. I was laying under
the hot rod,

18:14.392 --> 18:16.526
And I got to thinking
about you.

18:16.527 --> 18:19.563
Really? Usually
you're laying with me

18:19.564 --> 18:22.299
And get to thinking
about the hot rod.

18:24.602 --> 18:26.636
I think you're right.

18:26.637 --> 18:30.040
I don't really work on
charming you like I used to.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.809
Well, that's true.

18:31.810 --> 18:36.146
I don't think
you wore coveralls to bed
until the fifth anniversary.

18:36.147 --> 18:40.383
I just don't wanna
be one of those priests that
drops eggs on his three wives.

18:44.655 --> 18:45.923
What?

18:49.060 --> 18:53.296
Sometimes in a marriage,
you can get too comfortable.

18:53.297 --> 18:56.166
Well, we're both
getting lazy.

18:56.167 --> 18:59.770
I guess after 15 years
and three kids,
it's kinda natural.

18:59.771 --> 19:03.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I don't wanna get so lazy
that we stop trying.

19:03.341 --> 19:05.642
Me neither.

19:05.643 --> 19:08.078
Do you remember
when I asked you to marry me?

19:08.079 --> 19:11.281
I was so nervous, my hands
were as sweaty as toilets.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.189
Why were you nervous?

19:19.190 --> 19:22.159
I was afraid you'd say no
and I'd have to spend
the rest of my life without you.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.094
I knew I couldn't
return that ring.

19:26.430 --> 19:28.766
You still make me laugh.

19:28.767 --> 19:32.435
That's good.
It's the best 15 years
I've ever had.

19:39.844 --> 19:43.247
Got a little gift for you.
Stay right there.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.382
Oh...

19:47.752 --> 19:50.087
You still have
some charm left.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.355
I still have some tricks
up my sleeve.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.470
Whoa!

20:07.471 --> 20:09.873
Bond. James bond.

20:13.744 --> 20:17.214
<i>(♪ "the way you look tonight")</i>

20:21.485 --> 20:24.521
I wish that I had
a beautiful gown on
underneath my robe.

20:24.522 --> 20:27.424
What do you have on
under there?
Nothing.

20:27.425 --> 20:28.792
Ohh-ho.

20:31.095 --> 20:33.063
That's better than any gown.

20:58.323 --> 21:02.125
Are mom and dad up yet?
No. And quit bugging us!

21:02.126 --> 21:04.728
It's late. When are they
gonna get up?

21:04.729 --> 21:06.529
Don't you know anything?

21:06.530 --> 21:08.565
Whenever mom and dad
have a fight,

21:08.566 --> 21:12.336
Dad apologizes,
and then, the next morning,
they sleep late.

21:14.038 --> 21:17.174
I don't think
they're sleeping.

21:17.175 --> 21:21.011
You don't? Why not?

21:21.012 --> 21:24.647
Because I heard them
jumping up and down
on their bed.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.518
Oh... Well, you know,

21:28.519 --> 21:32.522
They're probably
just having one of their,
um... Somersault contests.

21:34.492 --> 21:37.427
Yeah. It's a lot like
the olympics.

21:38.729 --> 21:41.698
Sounds like fun.
Why don't they ask us to play?

21:44.468 --> 21:47.905
Trust me, mark.
You don't wanna play.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.676
Oh. Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

21:53.677 --> 21:57.714
Hi, sweetie.
What a great day.

21:57.715 --> 22:00.250
Yeah, what a great day.
Yeah.

22:01.719 --> 22:04.021
Brad and randy told me
what you were doing upstairs.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.227
They did?

22:10.228 --> 22:14.864
Yeah. Having one of those
somersault contests. Who won?

22:15.934 --> 22:19.036
Your mom won.
She always wins.

22:25.476 --> 22:28.178
You did win, didn't you?
Twice.

22:28.179 --> 22:29.646
<i>(grunts)</i>

22:33.751 --> 22:36.420
Does everybody know
what time it is?

22:39.424 --> 22:42.960
Ok, there's a little thing
we do here. We yell "tool time."

22:44.528 --> 22:46.930
It sounds like
you've given this
a lot of thought.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.865
Well, we had three...
Three babies...

22:48.866 --> 22:51.368
When the boys were babies,
and I... You know...

22:53.771 --> 22:56.039
Men are actually
a lot like babies.
