00:01.662 --> 00:03.129
<i>I'm afraid you are.</i>

00:03.146 --> 00:04.779
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:04.863 --> 00:06.864
Our universe
is starting to break down.

00:06.931 --> 00:09.066
What we've seen happening
on the other side

00:09.134 --> 00:10.567
<i>is starting</i>
<i>to happen here.</i>

00:12.237 --> 00:14.905
I destroyed their world
to save ours.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.007
May God have mercy
on us.

00:17.075 --> 00:18.742
<i>The machine came on</i>
<i>by itself.</i>

00:18.810 --> 00:19.810
<i>Without Peter.</i>

00:19.878 --> 00:21.178
You think that Walternate

00:21.246 --> 00:22.346
turned the machine on
over there?

00:22.414 --> 00:23.547
It's triggered

00:23.615 --> 00:24.915
on a sympathetic response

00:24.983 --> 00:26.483
<i>from the one over here;</i>
<i>Yes, it makes sense.</i>

00:26.551 --> 00:27.851
How could he do that
without Peter?

00:27.919 --> 00:29.753
We all thought

00:29.821 --> 00:31.155
that I could turn
the machine on.

00:31.222 --> 00:33.390
Maybe I can turn it off.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.259
Dear God.

00:37.695 --> 00:39.430
All civilians proceed

00:39.497 --> 00:42.099
to evacuation route
immediately.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.901
Agent Bishop,
take cover!

00:45.069 --> 00:47.738

01:02.220 --> 01:04.188
Peter, you were injured
in a fringe event.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.756
You're in good hands.
It's okay, I'm right here.

01:05.824 --> 01:07.458
Lie back.
Just relax.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.159
<i>He's bleeding</i>
<i>pretty bad here.</i>

01:09.227 --> 01:10.561
Get me some units
of his reserve blood.

01:10.628 --> 01:13.263
Start transfusion now.

01:13.331 --> 01:15.732
Agent Bishop,
please just lie still.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.335
<i>Get me the U.V. cauterizer.</i>

01:18.403 --> 01:20.337
It's all right, Peter.
You're going to be fine.

01:31.416 --> 01:33.817
I'd like to find out
how Peter Bishop is doing.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.152
May I see your badge?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.688
I don't have a badge...
Yet.

01:37.755 --> 01:40.123
I was just promoted
last week.

01:40.191 --> 01:42.526
I have a temporary barcode.
Can I show you that?

01:42.594 --> 01:44.428
Sure.

01:48.199 --> 01:49.633
Thank you, Agent Dunham.

01:49.701 --> 01:51.935
Agent Bishop has been
in recovery for an hour now.

01:52.003 --> 01:53.604
He should be out soon.

01:53.671 --> 01:54.638
<i>Ella.</i>

01:54.706 --> 01:56.974
Peter's fine,
Aunt Liv.

01:57.041 --> 01:58.509
He's in recovery.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.178
I mean, uh,
Agent Dunham, ma'am.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.680
You can just call me boss
like everybody else.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.649
Now, how are you?

02:05.717 --> 02:06.650
I'm fine.

02:06.718 --> 02:08.685
I remember
being in my SUV.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.053
And the next thing I knew,
I was on the ground

02:10.121 --> 02:12.122
and there was vortex
shrapnel everywhere.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.891
People are saying that
it's the end-of-dayers.

02:13.958 --> 02:15.692
That's what we think,
yeah.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.561
We think it's Moreau.

02:17.629 --> 02:18.662
<i>Hey.</i>

02:18.730 --> 02:20.497
Peter.

02:20.565 --> 02:23.467
How are you feeling?

02:23.535 --> 02:25.669
Ah...Just like new.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.173
- So what'd the doctor say?
- Doctor says I'm fine.

02:30.241 --> 02:32.175
No. They said to stay
off his feet for a few days.

02:32.243 --> 02:33.944
See? You're pushing
yourself.

02:34.012 --> 02:35.612
Moreau's out there.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.381
Peter, you got to
stay off your feet.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.549
This is gonna be
one of those times

02:38.616 --> 02:39.583
when you say,
"you were right."

02:39.651 --> 02:41.485
I'm not gonna say
that you were right

02:41.553 --> 02:45.322
because I got state-of-the-art
science on my side.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.891
I feel fine, hon.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.661
Do you remember what
you were saying in the field

02:50.728 --> 02:54.898
about the machine
and being from the past?

02:54.966 --> 02:56.700
Well, I didn't say
I didn't get my bell rung,

02:56.768 --> 02:58.035
but I'm doing better now.

02:58.102 --> 03:00.203
Two eggs over-easy,

03:00.271 --> 03:02.172
bacon, and grapefruit juice.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.409
That's what I made you
for breakfast on Sunday.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.744

05:19.744 --> 05:23.046
The security firm

05:24.682 --> 05:28.819
We think they gained entrance
from the side fire door.

05:28.886 --> 05:30.387
Okay, so how come they didn't
trigger the alarm?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.723
It was disabled.
But that's not all.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.959
We think we found

05:38.796 --> 05:41.832

<i>"The End of Days."</i>
<i>Ha.</i>

05:52.243 --> 05:54.144
That's one of my father's
favorite sermons.

05:54.212 --> 05:56.580
When the world dies
and a savior arrives

05:56.647 --> 05:58.682
to end the suffering
and usher all the worthy

05:58.750 --> 05:59.716
into heaven.

05:59.784 --> 06:01.184
Pass me those
alligator clips?

06:01.252 --> 06:03.253
Of course, if my father
ever met one of the kooks

06:03.321 --> 06:05.188
who's actually attempting
to end the world,

06:05.256 --> 06:06.890
he'd probably
kill them himself.

06:06.958 --> 06:08.158
<i>Agent.</i>

06:08.226 --> 06:10.894
Eyewitness

06:10.962 --> 06:13.930
I'll let you know if
any of this is worthwhile.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.268
- Anything?
- No.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.571
Not only can I not
tell you how the thing works,

06:21.639 --> 06:25.008
according to all the readings,
it shouldn't be working at all.

06:25.076 --> 06:27.644
You know, there's probably
only one person on Earth

06:27.712 --> 06:30.580
<i>who can tell us</i>
<i>how this thing functions.</i>

06:30.648 --> 06:32.282
Walter.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.484
Got any markers
you can call in?

06:34.552 --> 06:36.553
You think now's the time?

06:36.621 --> 06:39.956
I think it might be
past time.

07:13.002 --> 07:14.603
Hello, Walter.

07:16.973 --> 07:20.575
Must be bad if they're
letting you see me.

07:20.643 --> 07:22.477
It is.

07:24.847 --> 07:28.884
I heard a rumor
that the Sun was burning out.

07:28.951 --> 07:31.219
They don't
tell me much in here.

07:33.155 --> 07:35.023
The Sun is still shining.

07:35.091 --> 07:36.524
I also hear

07:36.592 --> 07:40.195
there's been a massive
increase in Kappa radiation.

07:40.263 --> 07:43.031
That one's true.

07:43.099 --> 07:45.734
A wormhole opened
in Central Park,

07:45.801 --> 07:47.402
right in the center
of Sheep's Meadow.

07:47.470 --> 07:49.571
Took us months but...

07:49.639 --> 07:51.439
We were finally able
to <i>amber</i> it over.

07:51.507 --> 07:57.112
A wormhole shouldn't emit
that type of radiation.

07:57.179 --> 07:59.915
Not unless it's a wormhole
through time.

07:59.982 --> 08:01.216
<i>Exactly right.</i>

08:01.284 --> 08:03.385
The carbon levels
were consistent

08:03.452 --> 08:05.120
with the late Paleozoic era.

08:05.187 --> 08:07.555
250 million years ago.

08:07.623 --> 08:09.758
Paleozoic.

08:09.825 --> 08:12.193
Theropods!

08:15.865 --> 08:18.867
My old self would have been
fascinated with that.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.309
How's Olivia?

08:27.376 --> 08:28.843
She's fine.
Thank you.

08:32.214 --> 08:34.381
I need your help.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.660
What is it?

08:45.728 --> 08:47.629
We're not exactly sure.

08:47.697 --> 08:49.497
Some kind of light bomb.

08:49.565 --> 08:51.032
It's made by
a terrorist group.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.134
They call themselves
the end-of-dayers.

08:53.202 --> 08:54.402
They use them on soft spots,

08:54.470 --> 08:56.905
trying to rip holes
in the fabric of the universe.

08:56.973 --> 08:59.474
Trying to accelerate
the end of days.

08:59.542 --> 09:01.843
I'm hoping if we can
figure out how it's made

09:01.911 --> 09:03.645
and maybe trace the parts...

09:03.713 --> 09:06.514
We can stop them
before it's too late.

09:11.253 --> 09:14.622
Even if I could help you...

09:14.690 --> 09:20.128
I can't do it from here.
I...would need my tools.

09:20.196 --> 09:23.198
My special instruments.

09:26.202 --> 09:28.870
We both know
that's not going to happen.

09:44.186 --> 09:45.620
Senator.
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

09:45.688 --> 09:46.888
Thank you for your time.

09:46.956 --> 09:48.656
No need for formality
in here.

09:48.724 --> 09:50.091
It's good to see you.

09:50.159 --> 09:52.027
Have a seat.

09:53.929 --> 09:55.797
You said it was urgent.

09:55.865 --> 09:57.232
It is.

09:57.299 --> 09:58.500
I assume you've been
briefed

09:58.567 --> 10:00.035
about the end of days
organization?

10:00.102 --> 10:02.337
I'm well aware
of the situation, yes.

10:02.405 --> 10:03.571
We recovered this device

10:03.639 --> 10:06.741
from what's left of
the opera house.

10:06.809 --> 10:09.711
Science Division's been
trying to crack the technology,

10:09.779 --> 10:11.246
but without much luck.

10:11.313 --> 10:12.814
What do you need?

10:14.650 --> 10:17.218
I need Walter.

10:17.286 --> 10:19.220
I want you to grant him
a temporary furlough

10:19.288 --> 10:20.622
so he can help us
on the case.

10:20.689 --> 10:22.390
That's out of the question.
I'm sorry.

10:22.458 --> 10:23.691
If we can understand
this technology,

10:23.759 --> 10:25.193
we might be able
to prevent future attacks.

10:25.261 --> 10:27.228
Consult with him
in prison if you need to.

10:27.296 --> 10:29.297
That's all I can offer.

10:29.365 --> 10:31.733
Why? You worried about
your reelection prospects?

10:34.303 --> 10:37.105
You know me better
than that.

10:37.173 --> 10:39.007
I'm worried about that.

10:39.075 --> 10:40.742
<i>The entire globe</i>
<i>is disintegrating.</i>

10:40.810 --> 10:42.844
We're running around
putting on band-aids,

10:42.912 --> 10:45.246
<i>and every day more people</i>
<i>are lost because of it,</i>

10:45.314 --> 10:48.149
<i>and Walter is responsible.</i>

10:54.924 --> 10:56.691
I know him.

10:56.759 --> 10:59.794
And I know his intentions
weren't this.

10:59.862 --> 11:01.729
But there's not
a single person out there

11:01.797 --> 11:03.798
who hasn't lost someone
they love because of him.

11:03.866 --> 11:05.834
You can't begrudge the anger
they feel towards him.

11:05.901 --> 11:08.269
I don't.

11:08.337 --> 11:10.271
I'm out there in the streets
with them every day.

11:10.339 --> 11:11.706
And, yeah, maybe I am
running around

11:11.774 --> 11:14.242
putting band-aids on it
until we can figure out

11:14.310 --> 11:15.910
<i>how to reverse the damage</i>
<i>that's already been done.</i>

11:15.978 --> 11:17.045
<i>But at least it's something.</i>

11:17.113 --> 11:18.813
And if we can figure out
this technology,

11:18.881 --> 11:22.617
I guarantee you we will
prevent future casualties.

11:26.622 --> 11:27.989
Phillip.

11:30.392 --> 11:36.030
If what we lost in Detroit
still means anything to you...

11:36.098 --> 11:38.833
Just give me one chance.

11:38.901 --> 11:40.635
That's all I'm asking.

11:52.648 --> 11:55.283
Where are my things?

11:55.351 --> 11:57.752
They're all still
in evidence, Walter.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.721
Don't worry.
Olivia's on it.

11:59.788 --> 12:01.723
Your equipment
will be here shortly.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.291
Mm.

12:03.359 --> 12:05.160
Will Astrid be here?

12:06.462 --> 12:08.563
No. Astrid's
a Fringe Agent now.

12:08.631 --> 12:10.732
- We need her out in the field.
- Oh.

12:10.799 --> 12:13.101
I suppose since she's
no longer caring for me,

12:13.169 --> 12:15.003
she's able to--

12:17.540 --> 12:18.973
spread her wings.

12:24.513 --> 12:27.448
May I take
a look out back?

12:27.516 --> 12:29.083
My old office.

12:42.498 --> 12:44.766
<i>Just leave him there for now.</i>

12:44.833 --> 12:46.401
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>where he wants him.</i>

12:48.103 --> 12:49.537
Walter.

12:49.605 --> 12:53.775
I didn't realize how much
I've missed swivel chairs.

12:56.779 --> 12:58.746
I've also missed swiveling.

12:58.814 --> 13:02.116
There's someone here
to see you.

13:02.184 --> 13:04.385
A visitor?

13:17.399 --> 13:19.033
Walter.

13:21.804 --> 13:23.338
Olivia!

13:33.582 --> 13:36.351
Congratulations
are in order, my dear.

13:36.418 --> 13:37.652
What for?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.721
The wedding, of course.

13:39.788 --> 13:40.989
Oh.

13:41.056 --> 13:43.124
That was a while ago now.

13:43.192 --> 13:45.126
This is the first
opportunity I've had

13:45.194 --> 13:48.796
to give you an appropriate
welcome to our family.

13:48.864 --> 13:51.799
I always did want
a daughter.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.668
Thank you, Walter.

13:53.736 --> 13:55.837
For goodness' sake!

13:55.904 --> 13:58.406
Doesn't the word fragile
mean anything to you?

14:08.417 --> 14:10.618
Was that you?

14:10.686 --> 14:15.657
I learned to control it
a few years ago.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.159
I'm impressed.

14:23.799 --> 14:26.000
So...What's the next
target?

14:26.068 --> 14:28.369
The wormhole
in Central Park.

14:28.437 --> 14:32.373
Considering your world
was destroyed by a wormhole,

14:32.441 --> 14:34.475
I suppose it's fitting.

14:34.543 --> 14:35.677
<i>Is this it?</i>

14:35.744 --> 14:39.347
Followed your specifications
to the letter.

14:39.415 --> 14:41.182
More than twice the yield

14:41.250 --> 14:44.018
of the device
we used last night.

14:52.061 --> 14:53.995
It won't be long...

14:54.063 --> 14:57.365
Till this world joins mine.

15:12.407 --> 15:13.807
Boys.

15:21.182 --> 15:22.783
Any luck?

15:22.850 --> 15:24.284
<i>Afraid not.</i>

15:24.352 --> 15:26.453
Can't make any sense
of this technology.

15:26.521 --> 15:30.023
I'll continue to run
diagnostics on the canister,

15:30.091 --> 15:33.693
but even if I am successful,
our world is still ending.

15:33.761 --> 15:35.796
You may stop this group,

15:35.863 --> 15:38.064
but you cannot
stop the inevitable.

15:38.132 --> 15:43.570
Our destiny was set the day
we triggered the machine.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.573
I didn't understand
until it was too late

15:46.641 --> 15:50.710
that our...two worlds
were inextricably linked.

15:50.778 --> 15:54.214
<i>Without one, the other</i>
<i>simply cannot exist.</i>

15:54.282 --> 15:56.883
When their world
was destroyed,

15:56.951 --> 16:00.220
that was the day
we sealed our fate.

16:00.288 --> 16:03.223
For all intent
and purposes...

16:03.291 --> 16:06.193
that was the day we died.

16:10.331 --> 16:12.966
We don't know that
for sure.

16:14.402 --> 16:17.170
Have you seen him?

16:18.973 --> 16:20.407
Walternate?

16:24.178 --> 16:25.679
No.

16:25.746 --> 16:28.582
Nobody has.
He's become a recluse.

16:28.649 --> 16:33.119
Imagine coming over here
to try to save the world...

16:33.187 --> 16:37.123
Only to be stuck here
when your world was destroyed.

16:38.426 --> 16:40.160
Not to mention
having the same face

16:40.228 --> 16:43.196
as the most reviled man
in the universe.

16:45.199 --> 16:48.768
I just wanted to say...

16:48.836 --> 16:52.305
At the trial,
you spoke on my behalf--

16:52.373 --> 16:55.308
Walter, I'm the one
who got in the machine.

16:57.211 --> 16:59.145
I'm the one who destroyed
the other universe.

16:59.213 --> 17:02.148
The courts perceived
that you did it...

17:02.216 --> 17:03.617
to defend our universe.

17:03.684 --> 17:05.986
And so do I.

17:06.053 --> 17:09.723
This all began with me,
my...hubris.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.156
Walter--

17:11.224 --> 17:13.326
and I just wanted
to say thank you.

17:16.230 --> 17:19.900
No matter who's at fault,
you are my dad.

17:53.334 --> 17:55.268
That smells
insanely good.

17:55.336 --> 17:56.670
After the day we had,

17:56.737 --> 17:58.872
I figured we deserved
better than takeout.

18:01.042 --> 18:03.843
Hey.
How you holding up?

18:03.911 --> 18:05.979
Ha. I'm doing fine.
Why?

18:06.047 --> 18:09.215
Well...you know Walter
would always cook

18:09.283 --> 18:12.052
when he was worried
about you, so...

18:12.119 --> 18:15.188
Well, of all the bad habits
I could pick up from him,

18:15.256 --> 18:17.624
that's the least of them.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.634
Amanda from across the street
gave it to us.

18:27.702 --> 18:29.803
That's you and me

18:29.870 --> 18:32.238
<i>and the little baby</i>
<i>that we're gonna have</i>

18:32.306 --> 18:34.474
that she is planning on
babysitting.

18:34.542 --> 18:37.010
Oh...

18:37.078 --> 18:39.846
Well, I think we should
get started on that right away.

18:39.914 --> 18:42.082
You're really gonna use
a drawing from a little girl

18:42.149 --> 18:43.149
to get lucky?

18:43.217 --> 18:46.920
It sounds so dirty
when you say it like that.

18:46.988 --> 18:49.756
She's a sweet
little girl.

18:55.129 --> 18:58.331
You know, hon, if you
wanted to reconsider...

19:01.102 --> 19:05.639
I can't say that I don't
think about it.

19:05.706 --> 19:08.842
And that I don't wish
things were different.

19:11.912 --> 19:14.981
Honey, people still
have families.

19:15.049 --> 19:17.283
Look at Amanda.

19:17.351 --> 19:19.886
She was born
into this world,

19:19.954 --> 19:22.088
and she's still happy.

19:22.156 --> 19:25.525
<i>And the world</i>
<i>could get better.</i>

19:25.593 --> 19:27.002
So I still think
we're gonna have a kid.

19:27.462 --> 19:28.369
I hope you're right.

19:28.394 --> 19:30.237
In fact, I think
we're gonna have several.

19:30.498 --> 19:32.766
Two, maybe three.
Little tribe of Bishops.

19:47.214 --> 19:49.749
Hello?
<i>I understand now.</i>

19:49.817 --> 19:52.819
They're splitting atoms...
not as an outcome goal

19:52.887 --> 19:54.354
but as a means to an end.

19:54.422 --> 19:55.689
Slow down, Walter.

19:55.756 --> 19:57.123
The diagnostics
on the canister--

19:57.191 --> 20:00.093
they show residual traces
of strontium 90.

20:00.161 --> 20:01.995
That's a radioactive
isotope.

20:02.063 --> 20:03.897
<i>That's how they're making</i>
<i>the electrilights.</i>

20:03.964 --> 20:05.465
Which means
it would leave a signature.

20:05.533 --> 20:08.368
Yes! Like radioactive
breadcrumbs.

20:08.436 --> 20:09.969
<i>They'll lead us</i>
<i>to whoever's doing this.</i>

20:10.037 --> 20:11.304
We need Science Division

20:11.372 --> 20:12.872
to monitor current
radiation tracking maps.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.507
It'll be faster
if you exclude

20:14.575 --> 20:16.976
readings inconsistent
with strontium 90.

20:17.044 --> 20:19.946
Look for spikes
in the remaining data.

20:30.491 --> 20:33.026
This is a campground.

20:33.094 --> 20:35.195
Do you think it's even possible
to split atoms here?

20:35.262 --> 20:37.197
I can see 'em making s'mores,
maybe,

20:37.264 --> 20:39.733
but weapons
of mass destruction? No.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.768
Is this the right
place?

20:41.836 --> 20:43.236
The tracking system
is detecting

20:43.304 --> 20:45.672
the same radioactive signature
that registered on the canister.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.140
So then where's the lab?

20:47.208 --> 20:49.375
Okay.
You keep searching.

20:49.443 --> 20:50.643
I'm gonna call this in.

20:50.711 --> 20:52.245
If you find anything
out of the ordinary,

20:52.313 --> 20:54.080
I want to know.
Yes, ma'am.

20:55.549 --> 20:58.384
Sir. We found this
sitting on top of a rock.

20:58.452 --> 21:00.487
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if it means anything.</i>

21:00.554 --> 21:03.356
- Thank you, Agent.
- Sure.

21:11.465 --> 21:12.565
<i>Peter.</i>

21:12.633 --> 21:13.900
<i>Maybe Walter was wrong</i>

21:13.968 --> 21:15.969
<i>about the radioactive signature.</i>
Yeah.

21:16.036 --> 21:17.403
I'll go back
to Science Division,

21:17.471 --> 21:18.805
see if maybe
something's wrong

21:18.873 --> 21:20.373
with the radiation
detection sensors.

21:20.441 --> 21:22.142
Okay, well, let me know
if you find anything.

21:22.209 --> 21:23.943
Yeah. Will do.

22:14.011 --> 22:16.312
How come no one
respects my desk?

22:16.380 --> 22:20.917
You're too nice.

22:20.984 --> 22:23.085
Team one, get ready to deploy.

22:23.153 --> 22:24.153
Perimeter breach.

22:24.221 --> 22:26.188
Sector eight.

22:26.256 --> 22:29.959
This technology's 10,

22:30.027 --> 22:31.494
maybe 15 years
ahead of its time.

22:31.562 --> 22:32.862
I don't mind saying

22:32.930 --> 22:36.198
it's something I would like
to have invented.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.868
I mean for peaceful
purposes,

22:38.936 --> 22:41.437
mining, maybe.

22:41.505 --> 22:43.873
Walter. What about
the components?

22:43.941 --> 22:46.008
Where were these parts
made?

22:46.076 --> 22:47.710
I haven't the foggiest.

22:50.948 --> 22:52.715
Dunham.

22:52.783 --> 22:55.618
I'm on my way.
What's wrong?

22:55.686 --> 22:57.219
There's been a security
breach at the wormhole.

22:57.287 --> 22:59.555
Someone in the park
I.D.'d Moreau.

22:59.623 --> 23:01.190
Come on.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.315
Hello?

23:26.383 --> 23:28.117
Hello?

24:21.772 --> 24:24.106
Hello, Peter.

24:38.555 --> 24:40.489
Why'd you leave me
the key, Walter?

24:40.557 --> 24:42.858
I knew you'd recognize it.

24:45.128 --> 24:46.762
I couldn't just call you.

24:46.830 --> 24:49.598
Yes, you could have.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.734
No, no, no, no.

24:51.802 --> 24:54.070
Not if I wanted
the proper reunion

24:54.137 --> 24:56.839
that we both
so richly deserve.

24:56.907 --> 24:59.842
So letting me know
that Moreau works for you--

24:59.910 --> 25:02.011
that was your way
of getting my attention?

25:02.079 --> 25:04.747
Among other things.

25:04.815 --> 25:09.719
I should have known that
the electrilight came from you.

25:09.786 --> 25:11.754
After all, Walter was
the only one brilliant enough

25:11.822 --> 25:13.489
to figure out how it worked.

25:13.557 --> 25:16.092
Stands to reason
that you were the only one

25:16.159 --> 25:18.894
brilliant enough
to invent it.

25:18.962 --> 25:21.864
Yin and Yang.
That's interesting.

25:21.932 --> 25:25.468
Interesting
that you should say that--

25:25.535 --> 25:26.869
Yin and Yang.

25:26.937 --> 25:29.505
Why are you doing this?
Yin and Yang.

25:29.573 --> 25:34.143
One man broke the universe.
The other man did nothing....

25:34.211 --> 25:38.147
But have his son stolen,
his life stolen, ruined.

25:41.651 --> 25:43.753
I came over here
at the end

25:43.820 --> 25:46.555
on a mission of mercy

25:46.623 --> 25:49.458
to ask for help
for my side.

25:49.526 --> 25:53.696
The race was lost,
a race I didn't initiate.

25:53.764 --> 25:55.631
But still, I came.

25:55.699 --> 25:58.167
And you destroyed us,
Peter...

25:58.235 --> 25:59.969
My son.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.704
You destroyed
your own--

26:01.772 --> 26:04.607
you activated the machine
on your side.

26:04.674 --> 26:08.677
You were going to use it
to destroy this universe.

26:08.745 --> 26:11.313
I only acted
in self-defense.

26:14.184 --> 26:17.586
Do you know what
it's like...

26:17.654 --> 26:21.657
to wake up and just
for a moment...

26:21.725 --> 26:25.461
Think that everything
is as it was?

26:25.529 --> 26:28.597
And then to realize
it's not...

26:28.665 --> 26:32.201
That the nightmare you had
was real.

26:32.269 --> 26:35.070
Soon everyone here
will experience loss

26:35.138 --> 26:39.041
the way that all those
over there did.

26:39.109 --> 26:42.178
Air, water...

26:42.245 --> 26:44.980
Light, even.

26:45.048 --> 26:47.783
But you...

26:47.851 --> 26:50.853
You will experience loss
the way I did.

26:52.656 --> 26:54.056
What does that mean?

26:54.124 --> 26:56.826
You destroyed
my universe, son,

26:56.893 --> 26:59.562
and I'm going to
destroy yours.

26:59.629 --> 27:01.864
And not all at once.

27:11.474 --> 27:14.043
Peter's still not
picking up.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.511
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

27:17.113 --> 27:19.181
We spotted a vehicle parked
near the perimeter breach.

27:19.249 --> 27:21.083
- What kind of vehicle?
- A bus.

27:21.151 --> 27:23.185
Okay. I want
all tactical teams

27:23.253 --> 27:24.820
to enter
the restricted area--

27:49.880 --> 27:53.015
I came here alone,
Walter.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.551
To make a personal plea
to you.

27:57.988 --> 28:01.857
I'm sorry for the suffering
that I've caused you.

28:05.228 --> 28:07.930
I'm sorry...

28:07.998 --> 28:11.867
For destroying your people.

28:11.935 --> 28:15.971
Our people.

28:16.039 --> 28:21.377
I'm sorry
for destroying our world.

28:21.444 --> 28:25.214
And if I could
take back that choice...

28:25.282 --> 28:27.216
I would.

28:31.755 --> 28:37.092
But it's no excuse
for what you're doing now.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.995
And it has to stop.

28:44.334 --> 28:48.103
I don't want to have
to use these.

28:53.076 --> 28:55.644
But you're going to
come with me now, father.

28:59.049 --> 29:00.482
You know, Peter,
if I was really there,

29:00.550 --> 29:03.452
I might not be able
to resist killing you.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.653
I think this is
the better way,

29:04.721 --> 29:06.855
so you can learn
about loss.

29:06.923 --> 29:09.425
Let's start by killing
someone you love.

29:21.271 --> 29:22.871
We're gonna evacuate
the area,

29:22.939 --> 29:24.773
try and contain
the wormhole.

29:24.841 --> 29:27.276
So can you move everyone
back to sector three?

29:53.831 --> 29:56.533
Olivia Dunham...

30:01.787 --> 30:05.991
My wife...

30:06.058 --> 30:09.227
was everything to me.

32:37.176 --> 32:38.810
Why have we stopped?

32:38.878 --> 32:41.613
What is this,
some kind of protest?

32:41.681 --> 32:43.948
No. It's the wormhole.

32:44.016 --> 32:46.584
They're still trying
to seal it up.

32:46.652 --> 32:48.420
Sergeant, when we start
moving again,

32:48.487 --> 32:50.689
can we cut over
and take Columbus, then we can--

32:50.756 --> 32:51.690
<i>Wait. No.</i>

32:51.757 --> 32:55.293
Turn the car around.

32:55.361 --> 32:57.028
Please...

32:57.096 --> 33:00.231
I need to get back
to my lab.

33:57.390 --> 34:00.158
Diagnostics
are almost complete.

34:06.165 --> 34:08.032
You used to call me
"Uncle Walter"

34:08.100 --> 34:10.301
do you remember?

34:10.369 --> 34:13.004
I don't remember much
from before it got bad.

34:16.942 --> 34:18.409
<i>I'm so sorry...</i>

34:18.476 --> 34:21.880
Ella.

34:21.947 --> 34:23.882
I understand...

34:23.949 --> 34:27.619
Words can't come close
to mitigating your loss.

34:27.686 --> 34:32.223
Truly, if I could go back
in time and change things,

34:32.291 --> 34:34.092
I would.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.226
I would give anything
to be able to go back

34:36.295 --> 34:37.829
and make different choices.

34:37.897 --> 34:40.264
But you can't.

34:40.331 --> 34:43.701
There aren't any happy endings
nowadays, are there?

34:49.007 --> 34:51.909
No. I suppose not.

35:05.791 --> 35:08.927
I remember the cow
that stayed over there.

35:12.531 --> 35:14.666
She had kind eyes.

35:15.968 --> 35:18.536
She did, didn't she?

35:20.673 --> 35:22.974
My gene.

35:23.042 --> 35:25.610
I do miss her.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.715
Oh...

35:30.783 --> 35:33.518
<i>That's it.</i>

35:47.900 --> 35:49.434
Peter, I was wrong.

35:49.502 --> 35:51.436
It's not too late.

35:54.139 --> 35:57.742
You can save both worlds.
We can do it all over again.

35:57.810 --> 36:01.646
This time, you--you simply need
to make a different choice,

36:01.714 --> 36:03.248
and should
something go wrong,

36:03.315 --> 36:05.550
then Olivia will be
our fail-safe.

36:05.618 --> 36:07.952
Walter, stop.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.355
Olivia is dead.

36:10.422 --> 36:13.024
But she won't be...

36:13.092 --> 36:14.659
Not then.

36:23.035 --> 36:24.602
The machine?

36:26.272 --> 36:28.339
I turned that on
15 years ago.

36:28.407 --> 36:30.041
And all the time
I sat in prison,

36:30.109 --> 36:33.378
I-I-I couldn't figure out
where it came from.

36:33.445 --> 36:36.614
I knew the pieces were buried
millions of years ago,

36:36.682 --> 36:38.616
but how did they get there,

36:38.684 --> 36:41.219
so deep in the past?

36:41.287 --> 36:43.721
But now I understand.

36:43.789 --> 36:46.424
I sent them there.

36:46.492 --> 36:49.494
The wormhole
in Central Park--

36:49.562 --> 36:52.597
I sent them back
through time.

36:52.665 --> 36:55.934
Peter, you can stop
the destruction

36:56.001 --> 36:58.336
before it occurs!

36:58.404 --> 37:01.072
If that's the case, just
don't send the machine back.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.507
Then we'll never
discover it,

37:02.575 --> 37:04.208
and I'll never destroy
the other universe.

37:04.276 --> 37:06.744
No, no, no.
It doesn't work that way.

37:06.812 --> 37:08.780
I have already done it.

37:08.847 --> 37:11.015
Therefore, I have no choice
but to do it again.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.451
Walter, that doesn't make
any sense.

37:13.519 --> 37:14.953
It does.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.088
It's a paradox.

37:17.156 --> 37:20.692
I can't change
what happens

37:20.759 --> 37:23.328
because
it's already happened.

37:23.395 --> 37:26.698
But you can make
a different choice

37:26.765 --> 37:29.267
within what happened.

37:29.335 --> 37:31.936
I simply need to find a way
to bring your consciousness

37:32.004 --> 37:33.204
forward to now

37:33.272 --> 37:35.840
so that you can witness
what will happen

37:35.908 --> 37:38.810
if you make
the same choice.

37:38.877 --> 37:41.679
Peter, for all I know,
it could be happening already.

37:41.747 --> 37:45.350
Don't you see?
We can fix everything.

37:45.417 --> 37:48.486
We can cheat
the rules of time.

37:51.557 --> 37:55.026
Imagine the repercussions.

38:03.302 --> 38:06.704
There's no way of telling
what the cost might be.

38:11.010 --> 38:13.411
But it can't be
worse than this.

38:15.481 --> 38:18.116
It can't be
worse than this.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.155
What would I need to do?

38:34.466 --> 38:36.200
Walter?
What's happening to him?

38:36.268 --> 38:37.769
His heart rate's
going up--

38:37.836 --> 38:41.539
156 and climbing!

38:41.607 --> 38:43.274
What's it doing to him?
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:43.342 --> 38:44.676
It's been 60 seconds now.

38:44.743 --> 38:46.678
How much longer are we gonna let
him stay inside that thing?

38:46.745 --> 38:48.546
Peter has interfaced
with the machine

38:48.614 --> 38:50.214
at a biological level.

38:50.282 --> 38:52.417
If we take him out
prematurely,

38:52.484 --> 38:55.486
I'm afraid we'll harm him.

39:00.823 --> 39:01.756
<i>What is it?</i>

39:01.824 --> 39:04.259
Sir, it just started
60 seconds ago.

39:04.305 --> 39:05.439
What started exactly?

39:05.477 --> 39:07.377
<i>The machine--</i>
<i>something is happening.</i>

39:07.445 --> 39:08.946
The diagnostics
are through the roof.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.715
Look at this--
the soft spots--

39:11.783 --> 39:14.351
they're not closing.
They're getting worse.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.590
Bring me
Olivia Dunham, now.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.530
I don't understand
what you're asking me to do.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.764
The drawing suggests

39:27.832 --> 39:30.634
that you have a connection
with the machine...

39:30.702 --> 39:32.402
That you can stop it,

39:32.470 --> 39:33.971
that you can turn it off.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.778
They outsmarted you,
didn't they?

39:41.846 --> 39:44.882
They know you turned
the machine on.

39:44.949 --> 39:47.818
So they put Peter
in theirs...

39:47.886 --> 39:50.821
And now we're the ones
that are gonna get destroyed.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.296
Something's wrong!
Help me, quick!

39:59.364 --> 40:01.598
Come on,
let's move it!

40:15.213 --> 40:16.780
Peter.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.017
Olivia...
You're alive.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.925
Are you doing that?

41:11.669 --> 41:13.904
I understand now.

41:15.873 --> 41:18.609
<i>Walter? Walter!</i>

41:18.676 --> 41:21.144
<i>I understand now.</i>

41:21.212 --> 41:23.447
I understand
what the machine does.

41:23.514 --> 41:26.149
I know what it's capable of,
and I know where it came from.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.484
The first people?

41:27.552 --> 41:28.819
<i>Yes, the first people,</i>
<i>Walter,</i>

41:28.886 --> 41:30.454
but the first people
are us--

41:30.521 --> 41:31.688
you, most specifically

41:31.756 --> 41:34.191
and maybe Ella and Astrid--
I don't know.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.359
I don't know who it was

41:35.426 --> 41:36.927
that took the machine
back through time.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.695
But I know something else.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.364
I've seen doomsday,

41:40.431 --> 41:43.800
and it is worse than anything
you could possibly imagine.

41:43.868 --> 41:47.871
This isn't a war
that can be won.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.007
<i>Our two worlds</i>
<i>are inextricable.</i>

41:50.074 --> 41:54.444
<i>If one side dies,</i>
<i>we all die.</i>

41:54.512 --> 41:57.714
So I've torn holes
in both the universes

41:57.782 --> 42:01.151
<i>and they lead here,</i>
<i>to this room.</i>

42:01.219 --> 42:05.455
A bridge so that we can
begin to work together to fix--

42:16.701 --> 42:19.670
you shattered my universe.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.906
You have any idea
how many deaths you've caused?

42:22.974 --> 42:25.776
That was an accident.

42:25.843 --> 42:28.645
What you have tried to do
you've done on purpose!

42:28.713 --> 42:30.113
<i>Whatever</i>
<i>you've both done,</i>

42:30.181 --> 42:32.816
we're here now.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.619
So maybe it's time
we start to fix it.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.602
You were right.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.272
They don't remember Peter.

42:55.340 --> 42:59.743
How could they?
He never existed.

42:59.811 --> 43:03.113
He served his purpose.
