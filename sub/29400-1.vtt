01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.522
[CRSA Man] Nothin' I can do.

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:50.826
You can't let that
plane leave.

01:23:50.851 --> 01:23:51.591
You understand me?

01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:52.505
Not an option.

01:23:52.549 --> 01:23:54.072
Sir, that man is wanted for

01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:55.615
a double homicide in the
United States.

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.293
This is not the United States.

01:23:57.336 --> 01:23:59.382
I'm aware of that but we
need to stop that plane.

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:01.210
[CRSA Man] Nothin' I can do.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:03.950
[Number One] Sir?

01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:06.780
[Woman] Yeah it's empty.

01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:07.912
Fuck.

[airplane engine whirring]

01:24:13.657 --> 01:24:14.701
Don't touch me.

01:24:15.746 --> 01:24:17.443
It's okay, it's fine.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.321
You know this guy?

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:29.586
Um, no, I don't think so.

01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:30.629
You sure?

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:33.024
Yeah, I'd remember that face.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:36.071
See I think you do because
he was trailed here yesterday.

01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:39.204
And I know you two met.

01:24:39.248 --> 01:24:42.120
And then a plane leased
by a subsidiary of yours

01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:45.341
left Vancouver this
morning for Cartagena

01:24:45.384 --> 01:24:47.343
and guess who was on the plane.

01:24:48.779 --> 01:24:49.867
I'll play your game.

01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:51.651
Oh God, it's not a game, man.

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:54.263
I know you're behind all this.

01:24:57.309 --> 01:24:59.311
What can you prove, right?

01:25:00.747 --> 01:25:02.445
You got a jet that may or may

01:25:02.488 --> 01:25:05.926
not belong to me went
to Cartagena.

01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:10.888
I mean Colombia is more
popular than Cabo right now.

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.979
It's a big boat you're rockin'.

01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:19.114
There are people like me
and governments,

01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:24.684
all across North America who
loan an awful lotta money

01:25:24.728 --> 01:25:27.339
to our brothers and sisters
in Central and South America

01:25:27.383 --> 01:25:30.429
and they are not repaying
those loans with coffee beans.

01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:35.086
You're dirty.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.785
