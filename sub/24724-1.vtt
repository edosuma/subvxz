02:43.695 --> 02:47.697
"All men
are created equal."

02:47.699 --> 02:49.468
Mm.

03:52.598 --> 03:54.434
Hmm?

07:06.324 --> 07:07.726
Five years?

07:39.158 --> 07:40.793
Hey!

08:13.858 --> 08:16.962
<i>I'm excited,
but scared.</i>

08:18.930 --> 08:24.134
<i>Forgive me, but I feel it is
the best choice for me now.</i>

08:24.136 --> 08:26.937
<i>I'll make a lot of money
for you, Dad,</i>

08:26.939 --> 08:30.707
<i>and when I come home,
you'll be proud,</i>

08:30.709 --> 08:34.044
<i>make up for what
I did to my soul,</i>

08:34.046 --> 08:37.049
<i>the shame
I caused the family."</i>

09:22.061 --> 09:24.994
I could carry
twice as much as both of you.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.100
Speak English!
We're in America.

09:31.102 --> 09:34.873
Where the
hell do you think you're going?

09:39.711 --> 09:42.112
Nowhere.
Passing through.

09:42.114 --> 09:45.848
Yeah, right!
You think we're stupid?

09:45.850 --> 09:49.486
No Chinamen allowed
to mine here!

09:49.488 --> 09:51.591
You're bad luck!

09:55.059 --> 09:56.193
Go on!

10:01.899 --> 10:02.898
What do you care?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.400
This place has been panned
to death!

10:04.402 --> 10:09.875
That may be, but I don't want
these monkeys to know that.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.913
Get your chink asses
out of here!

10:15.913 --> 10:17.149
Uhh!

10:22.153 --> 10:23.286
Shut down!

10:26.325 --> 10:27.893
Oh!

10:29.227 --> 10:31.161
It's okay.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.030
I really have a feeling
about this place.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.132
Maybe we'll
get lucky, huh?

10:43.775 --> 10:45.110
Idiots!

10:54.052 --> 10:56.187
What'd I tell you, huh?

10:58.356 --> 11:01.660
Fool's gold.
You got lucky.

11:02.927 --> 11:06.097
I want you to come with me
to work on the railroad.

11:07.131 --> 11:08.898
Father, we've been
through this.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.901
You think chasing after
a little rock is a living?

11:11.903 --> 11:15.040
The white man throwing
a bottle at you?

11:16.908 --> 11:18.340
The amount of gold
we found today

11:18.342 --> 11:19.975
is more than six months
working on the railroad!

11:19.977 --> 11:22.344
Don't argue with me!

11:22.346 --> 11:24.216
I'm right about this.

11:27.586 --> 11:31.157
Well, well, well.
We meet again.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.899
What do you want?

11:49.975 --> 11:54.276
You Chinamen think
you can fool me, right?

11:54.278 --> 11:56.879
Where's my gold?

11:56.881 --> 12:00.251
What makes you think
we have any gold?

12:06.924 --> 12:09.925
You think you can
buy me off that cheaply?

12:09.927 --> 12:11.996
Where's the rest?

12:15.634 --> 12:16.699
We did not find any more.

12:16.701 --> 12:19.869
We only worked the claims
you abandoned.

12:19.871 --> 12:23.272
Lie to me once,
I can forgive you.

12:23.274 --> 12:28.013
Lie to me twice,
I want half of you.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.914
But if you lie to me
a third time,

12:30.916 --> 12:32.949
I swear to God
you're a dead man.

12:32.951 --> 12:36.956
Now, where is the gold?

12:38.657 --> 12:40.960
What's in that pouch?

12:42.894 --> 12:44.026
Nothing. See?

12:44.028 --> 12:46.028
Thompson, come on!

12:46.030 --> 12:48.098
Go on! Look in that pile
over there!

12:48.100 --> 12:50.367
Get on with it, man!

12:50.369 --> 12:53.670
You think you can make
a fool out of me, Chinaman?

12:53.672 --> 12:55.906
Show me where it is,

12:55.908 --> 12:58.978
or I'll put a bullet
in his brain.

12:59.443 --> 13:02.213
That's all, okay?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.180
No funny business.

13:05.182 --> 13:07.483
Thompson,
we gotta go!

13:07.485 --> 13:08.618
Let's get out of here!

13:08.620 --> 13:13.024
Don't you go anywhere,
because I'll be back.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.359
Because if you do,
I will find you

13:17.361 --> 13:19.331
and I will gut you.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.068
What were you thinking?

13:25.070 --> 13:26.936
More than the both of you.

13:26.938 --> 13:29.940
They could've
taken everything.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.041
Better that
than getting us killed.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.116
My son has a lot to learn.

13:40.118 --> 13:42.218
Are you coming with me
to work on the railroad,

13:42.220 --> 13:44.720
or are you gonna stay on
with this nonsense?

13:44.722 --> 13:47.225
I'm staying here.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.033
Father!

14:37.274 --> 14:40.078
Whoa. Whoa.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.083
That's what he said.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.323
Mm-hmm.

16:39.197 --> 16:40.228
Do you want me
to read it to you?

16:40.230 --> 16:42.297
You speak English?

16:42.299 --> 16:45.568
I was told I was working
at a flower house,

16:45.570 --> 16:46.969
taking care of flowers.

16:46.971 --> 16:51.406
If I had been told the truth,
do you think I would be here?

16:51.408 --> 16:53.642
I'm willing to scrub
the floors.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.557
Li Li! Li Li!

18:04.348 --> 18:05.515
We're hungry!

18:05.517 --> 18:06.716
Feed us!

18:06.718 --> 18:09.221
The kitchen is closed.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.221
Sorry, no more food.

18:12.223 --> 18:13.692
Now it's open.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.677
Where's my food?

18:44.422 --> 18:45.353
What is this?

18:45.355 --> 18:48.359
Special food
from China.

18:55.032 --> 18:57.336
Mm!

18:58.336 --> 19:00.538
What do you chinks
call this?

19:06.377 --> 19:07.543
Chop...

19:07.545 --> 19:08.411
Suey.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.681
Chop suey.

19:14.551 --> 19:15.617
Here.

19:23.394 --> 19:24.730
Chop suey?

21:03.827 --> 21:06.395
Having a good day!

21:06.397 --> 21:07.796
Busy!

21:07.798 --> 21:09.399
Good!

21:09.401 --> 21:11.836
Your chop suey
is getting famous.

21:48.205 --> 21:49.674
Take her order!

21:51.442 --> 21:52.941
Fine.

21:52.943 --> 21:55.510
If you're not going
to talk to her, I will.

21:55.512 --> 21:59.717
Wait! Okay.

23:31.009 --> 23:32.810
Mm!

24:40.178 --> 24:41.913
Whoa.

29:58.362 --> 29:59.964
Oh!

31:29.452 --> 31:31.889
Uh...

32:04.454 --> 32:08.225
Compliments
of T. Wong's Chop Suey.

32:28.144 --> 32:29.478
Tastes like home.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.516
You speak English?

32:32.615 --> 32:36.119
Yes. My father taught me.

32:36.854 --> 32:38.389
And the kung fu?

32:40.156 --> 32:42.356
My father, as well.

32:42.358 --> 32:45.462
And did he come to America
with you?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.333
No.

32:50.335 --> 32:53.971
I ran away with my friend Lily.

32:57.407 --> 33:01.278
And that's how you ended up here
at the Flower House.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.383
I'm not a prostitute.

33:09.252 --> 33:12.389
I thought the world
was going to be different.

33:16.259 --> 33:18.496
Lily's not so lucky.

33:36.913 --> 33:39.549
Ah! Ah!

34:51.655 --> 34:53.621
...study, write English.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.501
Why didn't you marry younger?

35:07.503 --> 35:11.476
Most girls in China get married
when they're 15.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.543
I needed to take care
of my father.

35:15.545 --> 35:17.378
He got sick.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.483
We needed the money.

35:21.318 --> 35:23.418
He was worried about my future,

35:23.420 --> 35:26.423
so he arranged a marriage.

35:27.824 --> 35:29.426
I see.

35:30.293 --> 35:32.362
But I couldn't do it.

35:35.733 --> 35:39.267
How did your husband take it
when you left him?

35:39.269 --> 35:41.436
I don't know.

35:41.438 --> 35:44.438
But seeing him drunk once...

35:44.440 --> 35:46.676
It was enough.

35:51.614 --> 35:53.150
What about you?

35:54.684 --> 35:57.154
What are you
running away from?

36:06.297 --> 36:09.398
My father is very proud.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.432
He works at the railroads.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.869
But when I asked him
to stay with me,

36:13.871 --> 36:18.840
he said, "No. I don't want
to wash dishes for people

36:18.842 --> 36:22.346
who think chop suey
is Chinese food."

36:23.313 --> 36:25.079
Maybe he's proud of you.

36:25.081 --> 36:27.652
When was the last time
you saw him?

36:29.585 --> 36:31.452
He's in Fresno now.

36:31.454 --> 36:33.690
Not much of a chance
to see him.

36:35.592 --> 36:38.362
Why don't you write to him?

36:40.664 --> 36:41.732
Hmm.

36:42.733 --> 36:46.504
I'm sure he's lonely out there.

36:52.108 --> 36:54.511
It's from my grandma.

36:57.481 --> 37:00.882
She said it's supposed
to protect me.

37:00.884 --> 37:02.652
May I?

37:14.697 --> 37:17.534
I must get back to my chores.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.604
On the boat from China,

37:22.606 --> 37:25.740
men kept talking about Jin Shan.

37:25.742 --> 37:27.141
What is it?

37:27.143 --> 37:29.411
It means "gold mountain."

37:29.413 --> 37:31.545
What is Gold Mountain?

37:31.547 --> 37:34.383
It's another name for America.

37:34.385 --> 37:35.851
You mean it's made up?

37:35.853 --> 37:38.856
It's a way
of giving people hope.

37:42.492 --> 37:45.462
We all need Gold Mountain.

38:38.949 --> 38:41.318
The American Dream...

38:42.219 --> 38:44.588
Chinese style.

41:03.059 --> 41:04.124
Hmph!

41:44.635 --> 41:45.700
Huh!

41:54.177 --> 41:57.914
Oh!

42:10.927 --> 42:15.833
Are you having
a little trouble with... this?

42:18.835 --> 42:20.838
I can't seem to get it...

42:21.871 --> 42:23.938
Maybe you're trying it
too hard.

42:23.940 --> 42:27.545
Put this seed
into your mouth like this...

42:29.880 --> 42:32.780
and balance it
between your teeth...

42:32.782 --> 42:34.551
and crack it.

42:39.856 --> 42:41.592
Now you try.

42:51.467 --> 42:53.101
I don't think
I can get it.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.838
You don't know
what you're missing.

43:04.715 --> 43:05.813
Interesting technique...

43:05.815 --> 43:09.284
but I think you need
to show me that again

43:09.286 --> 43:11.121
so I can learn how.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.023
Open your mouth...

43:16.226 --> 43:18.796
and crack it.

43:22.498 --> 43:24.067
Mm-hmm!

45:08.905 --> 45:10.237
Hmm?

45:22.251 --> 45:24.320
Huh?

46:16.338 --> 46:20.974
I don't believe
in this Gold Mountain anymore.

46:20.976 --> 46:23.912
- Let me help.
- How?

46:23.914 --> 46:27.282
I can talk to Madame Pong about
buying out your contract.

46:27.284 --> 46:30.450
And what, will you own me
just like Yu Hing owns Lily?

46:30.452 --> 46:32.452
No, no, no, no, no!

46:32.454 --> 46:34.421
I will tear up
your contract.

46:34.423 --> 46:35.990
You will be a free woman.

47:32.481 --> 47:34.050
I love her!

47:39.222 --> 47:40.457
Love...

47:48.530 --> 47:51.134
Good luck.

49:43.512 --> 49:45.345
You have the address.

49:45.347 --> 49:46.947
It's my family's cottage
in Los Angeles.

49:46.949 --> 49:49.583
You'll be safe there. My
uncles will be around to help.

49:49.585 --> 49:51.520
- Thank you, brother.
- Get down!

50:19.148 --> 50:21.349
I'll get
there soon as I can.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.383
What about
the food stall?

50:22.385 --> 50:24.151
I can get someone
to cover it.

50:24.153 --> 50:25.420
- You sure?
- Of course.

50:25.422 --> 50:28.655
My uncles have wanted me
to come back to Los Angeles.

50:28.657 --> 50:30.423
They belong
to the See Yup Association,

50:30.425 --> 50:34.295
and they need all the help they
can to fight people like Yu Hing.

50:34.297 --> 50:35.563
You promise you are
going to find Lily?

50:35.565 --> 50:38.932
I told you, I'll find her.
You have my word.

50:38.934 --> 50:40.034
Can you get this
to my father?

50:40.036 --> 50:43.273
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

50:44.706 --> 50:46.275
Be safe.

52:33.615 --> 52:36.349
I know you're worried.

52:36.351 --> 52:39.552
Even if Yu Hing finds out
we're in Los Angeles,

52:39.554 --> 52:41.621
we'll be surrounded
by Sam's family.

52:41.623 --> 52:43.791
It is not us
I'm worried about.

52:43.793 --> 52:45.628
It is Lily.

52:46.528 --> 52:49.463
Please.
Sam will find her.

52:49.465 --> 52:51.568
He's like
a brother to me.

52:56.806 --> 52:58.039
Tom...

52:58.041 --> 53:01.644
I did not want to put you
in this kind of danger.

53:03.378 --> 53:06.182
You did not have
to buy my freedom.

53:08.318 --> 53:09.383
Peony...

53:09.385 --> 53:11.651
you are not indebted
to me for anything.

53:11.653 --> 53:15.659
You're free to go anywhere
and do anything you want.

53:17.860 --> 53:19.528
Mm.

53:25.467 --> 53:27.233
I want you to know that...

53:27.235 --> 53:31.740
I have been in love with you ever
since the first time I saw you.

53:33.576 --> 53:35.443
You brought joy to my heart,

53:35.445 --> 53:37.514
and you made me feel alive.

54:33.902 --> 54:35.337
Mm.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.581
Mm.

54:54.456 --> 54:55.692
Huh!

54:58.527 --> 55:02.695
You know, a fortune teller once
said that my life would be cursed.

55:02.697 --> 55:06.735
So, is there anything else
that I should be worried about?

55:07.570 --> 55:09.570
No.

55:09.572 --> 55:12.440
Why, you don't believe me?

55:12.442 --> 55:14.208
Of course
I don't believe you!

55:15.210 --> 55:16.476
Oh, my God!

55:28.523 --> 55:30.224
Oh...

55:30.226 --> 55:31.858
Where's my pendant?

55:31.860 --> 55:33.596
Pendant?

55:34.530 --> 55:35.899
Where's my pendant?

55:36.833 --> 55:38.735
Where is it?

55:39.768 --> 55:40.903
I got it!

55:41.871 --> 55:43.340
Oh!

55:49.612 --> 55:51.845
When my grandma gave me
this jade pendant,

55:51.847 --> 55:54.014
she told me it would
bring me good luck.

55:54.016 --> 55:58.887
I have to believe
that it led me to you.

56:08.697 --> 56:11.634
I will love you
wholeheartedly...

56:12.501 --> 56:14.371
and be a good wife to you.

56:19.275 --> 56:21.610
You're my Jin Shan.

56:22.043 --> 56:23.543
Pinch me.

56:23.545 --> 56:24.912
Pinch you?

56:24.914 --> 56:26.280
Yes, pinch me!

56:26.282 --> 56:27.847
To make sure
I'm not dreaming.

56:27.849 --> 56:30.920
I can do better
than that.

56:34.690 --> 56:35.990
How do you feel?

56:35.992 --> 56:37.023
I'm not sure yet.

56:40.963 --> 56:43.296
You still think
you're dreaming?

56:43.298 --> 56:45.065
I think you need
to do that again.

56:45.067 --> 56:46.936
No problem!

56:49.938 --> 56:51.407
Whew!

57:45.860 --> 57:47.994
It is almost like home!

57:47.996 --> 57:49.630
It is home.

59:18.820 --> 59:20.056
Uh!

59:40.775 --> 59:42.644
I'm so clumsy.

59:45.114 --> 59:46.816
It's okay.

59:52.288 --> 59:53.889
Tom...

01:01:15.804 --> 01:01:18.040
Over here! Come on!

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:42.057
So, how did you
learn all those secrets?

01:02:48.163 --> 01:02:49.298
Peony...

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:53.099
At Madame Pong's, did you...?

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:54.367
Of course not!

01:02:55.436 --> 01:02:57.905
Well...

01:02:57.907 --> 01:03:00.376
Maybe I did see some things.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:02.441
Did you see this?

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.177
No!

01:03:05.179 --> 01:03:06.845
This?

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:10.316
Okay, okay! Remind me to never
get in a real fight with you.

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:12.985
Mm-hmm. Just remember
who's the boss.

01:03:12.987 --> 01:03:15.090
- Mrs. Wong.
- Mm-hmm!

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:18.025
Tom!
Peony!

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.360
I've got Lily!

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:21.864
Tom!

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.271
- Sam! Lily!
- Sam!

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.880
Mm...

01:05:34.429 --> 01:05:35.931
Oh!

01:06:13.367 --> 01:06:15.971
Here, try this.

01:06:25.246 --> 01:06:26.612
That bad?

01:06:26.614 --> 01:06:28.248
Tom...

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.682
I don't feel good.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:34.090
Maybe I ought
to get Dr. Tong.

01:07:39.954 --> 01:07:41.456
Oh!

01:07:56.438 --> 01:07:59.539
<i>"Pa, I hope
you received my first letter.</i>

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:03.677
<i>I've gotten married.
She is wonderful.</i>

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:05.045
<i>From Taisan.</i>

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:07.479
<i>I couldn't have dreamed
of a better wife.</i>

01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:09.615
<i>And I also have
a surprise for you.</i>

01:08:09.617 --> 01:08:11.251
<i>You're going
to be a grandfather!</i>

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.987
<i>I cannot wait for you
to meet our family.</i>

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:17.591
<i>I think that you
will be proud, very proud."</i>

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.536
Oh!

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.225
Tom...

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.229
Tom.

01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:29.398
Okay.

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:56.322
You should
stay with the baby. Let me go.

01:09:56.324 --> 01:09:58.692
I should've forced
him to quit the railroads.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.730
- Tom...
- But he was too stubborn.

01:10:02.596 --> 01:10:04.464
He should've been with us.

01:10:08.603 --> 01:10:10.669
I shouldn't
leave you like this.

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:22.451
Shh, it's okay. Shhh...

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:34.263
Both of us will be here
when you get back.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.765
Promise?

01:10:37.765 --> 01:10:39.567
I promise.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:03.889
Hmm...

01:14:47.148 --> 01:14:49.382
<i>"My son...</i>

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:52.785
<i>this country provides
great opportunity.</i>

01:14:52.787 --> 01:14:54.152
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

01:14:54.154 --> 01:14:58.790
<i>But, most important,
don't give up.</i>

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.226
<i>I want you to know</i>

01:15:00.228 --> 01:15:02.961
<i>I am proud
to call you my son.</i>

01:15:02.963 --> 01:15:07.000
<i>We Chinese can be
the best of friends</i>

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:10.739
<i>or the worst of enemies."</i>

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:51.443
- This month's tea money.
- Little light.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:55.113
This is what my uncles
and I have always paid you.

01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:56.749
Rate's gone up.

01:15:56.751 --> 01:15:58.619
Chop chop, Chinaman,
go get it.

01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:24.579
You want to count it?

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.984
No, I can always
come back for more.

01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:36.022
Thompson, what do you
think of this?

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.894
It's good. Good stuff.

01:16:41.128 --> 01:16:43.228
Oh, fuck.

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:45.164
So, what did you find?

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:47.200
Did you see
any gold nuggets?

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:49.102
Hold on a minute.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:53.609
Man works for me,
so I'll be asking the questions.

01:16:56.978 --> 01:16:58.844
So, what'd you find?

01:16:58.846 --> 01:17:02.115
See any gold nuggets?

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.183
No, sir.

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:05.817
But I did find
a whole lot of gold coins.

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:07.285
What did I tell you?

01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:10.522
They have been poaching my claim
up Sutter's Mill for years.

01:17:10.524 --> 01:17:14.760
A few gold coins
don't prove a damn thing.

01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:16.829
Whose side
are you on, cop?

01:17:16.831 --> 01:17:18.196
If the Chinks
do anything illegal,

01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:20.767
believe me,
I'll be going after them.

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.001
But if you can't prove it,

01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:25.073
I ain't gonna do anything
just because you say so.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.544
Hmph.

01:17:32.546 --> 01:17:35.049
I believe we're done here.

01:17:41.922 --> 01:17:44.925
Enjoy your meal,
Captain.

01:17:54.068 --> 01:17:57.202
The rumor has it the Chinks
from San Francisco

01:17:57.204 --> 01:18:00.071
are trying to muscle in
on the See Yup Association.

01:18:00.073 --> 01:18:04.043
Round up our guys before these yellow
bastards start fighting each other.

01:18:04.045 --> 01:18:07.082
- We'll take care of business.
- All right.

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:11.752
Nice.

01:18:12.886 --> 01:18:15.222
But it won't work
without my help.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.357
Who are you?
What do you want?

01:18:19.359 --> 01:18:22.997
Someone who wants
the same thing you do.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:27.232
These bastards took my girl.

01:18:27.234 --> 01:18:30.738
I want them arrested
for kidnapping.

01:18:32.039 --> 01:18:35.711
You get the gold.
I get the girl.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:40.847
I don't usually do business
with your kind.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:43.051
But we want the same thing.

01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:59.267
How can I help you?

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:06.273
This gentleman says
you kidnapped his girl.

01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:09.040
I'm here to arrest you.

01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:10.209
Really?

01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:12.010
Where's the warrant?

01:19:12.012 --> 01:19:15.015
Hand her over
and I won't put you in jail.

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.287
When did he
become the law?

01:19:22.289 --> 01:19:23.992
Go, quickly!

01:19:25.025 --> 01:19:26.392
He stole my property.

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:28.326
Mine, too.

01:19:28.328 --> 01:19:29.227
You have no proof.

01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:31.332
I'm no one's property.

01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:39.173
I have proof.

01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:41.173
This is fake.

01:19:41.175 --> 01:19:43.174
As if you can read it!

01:19:43.176 --> 01:19:44.910
I wasn't kidnapped.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.321
What the hell
is going on here?

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:59.392
Her husband and I are being
accused of kidnapping her.

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.293
Her husband?

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:01.593
Yes, the father
of her child.

01:20:01.595 --> 01:20:06.065
She put a mark on this
employment agreement with me.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.334
She owes me
four years of work.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:12.240
Whether or not she's
married is irrelevant.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.243
Let me see this contract.

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.717
Ask her if that's
her fingerprint.

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.986
This is not.

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.353
You speak English?

01:20:28.355 --> 01:20:29.423
Yes.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:36.262
Is this
your fingerprint?

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:39.732
Of course not! I wouldn't
put a fingerprint.

01:20:39.734 --> 01:20:40.633
Why not?

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:44.135
Because I can sign
my own name,

01:20:44.137 --> 01:20:45.972
and I can read, too.

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:48.040
And that entire contract
is a fake.

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:49.241
She's lying...

01:20:49.243 --> 01:20:51.847
She needs to prove it.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.248
Go on.

01:20:58.252 --> 01:21:01.086
"I do hereby declare
this contract

01:21:01.088 --> 01:21:03.155
is binding in the State
of California

01:21:03.157 --> 01:21:06.261
in the year
of our Lord 1871..."

01:21:08.162 --> 01:21:09.995
Do you want me to go on?

01:21:09.997 --> 01:21:11.866
No.

01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:24.945
I don't know what the hell's
going on, but I know him...

01:21:27.047 --> 01:21:29.781
and I don't know you.

01:21:29.783 --> 01:21:32.550
So I want you and your men
to get the hell out of here.

01:21:32.552 --> 01:21:35.053
We don't need your kind
of trouble in this town.

01:21:35.055 --> 01:21:37.522
And you,
I want you to crawl back

01:21:37.524 --> 01:21:40.192
in the hole
that you crawled out of.

01:21:40.194 --> 01:21:42.163
Stay away from my men!

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.063
This isn't the Wild West!

01:21:45.065 --> 01:21:47.465
This is Los Angeles!

01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:48.970
Come on.

01:21:49.503 --> 01:21:50.971
Go.

01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:54.208
You.

01:21:55.542 --> 01:22:00.314
Hey, you. I said go.

01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:03.816
Go!

01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:44.190
You are a little man.

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:46.659
You have no vision.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:52.999
How?

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:55.867
By kowtowing
to the white man?

01:22:55.869 --> 01:23:00.371
All these people know
and understand is power.

01:23:00.373 --> 01:23:05.177
I am the one; not
a little man like you.

01:23:05.179 --> 01:23:08.083
Can make them respect us.

01:24:38.305 --> 01:24:39.239
Hey, friends...

01:24:40.474 --> 01:24:43.675
The Chinamen are gonna
go to war.

01:24:43.677 --> 01:24:47.478
<i>Once they are busy
fighting each other,</i>

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.983
we will go down there
and we will clean them out.

01:24:53.287 --> 01:24:59.491
We will send John Chinaman
back to where he came from!

01:24:59.493 --> 01:25:00.759
Am I right?

01:25:00.761 --> 01:25:02.260
Am I right?!

01:25:35.529 --> 01:25:38.696
In 15 minutes,
I will walk down Nigger Alley.

01:25:38.698 --> 01:25:40.165
Policemen will cover me
from behind.

01:25:40.167 --> 01:25:43.369
<i>When I get
to the general store,</i>

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:45.504
I will give you all a sign.

01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:48.574
Then it's every man
for themselves.

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:52.546
Whatever you find
you can keep.

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:43.094
Gentlemen, let us take back
what is ours!

01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:44.429
Yeah!

01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:45.731
Yeah! Come on!

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:48.500
Bust out the door! Come on!

01:26:48.502 --> 01:26:51.472
Let's take back what's ours!

01:26:55.842 --> 01:26:57.612
Come on!

01:26:58.412 --> 01:27:00.345
Come on!

01:27:00.347 --> 01:27:03.318
Where are you going, son?
Get up there!

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:09.120
Take everything!

01:27:09.122 --> 01:27:10.657
Come on!

01:27:13.426 --> 01:27:15.660
They shot him!

01:27:15.662 --> 01:27:18.532
There! There he is!

01:27:41.788 --> 01:27:42.856
Easy, easy.

01:27:46.659 --> 01:27:49.730
Come on, round 'em all up!

01:28:37.511 --> 01:28:38.846
China...

01:28:40.847 --> 01:28:43.583
I'll see you in hell.

01:29:09.643 --> 01:29:11.412
Here we go. Come on!

01:29:19.619 --> 01:29:20.954
Huh?

01:29:27.494 --> 01:29:29.760
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:29.762 --> 01:29:31.897
Hang him!

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:35.869
Hang him! Let's go! Yeah!

01:29:42.909 --> 01:29:44.679
Hmm?

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:29.724
Come on! String him up!

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.137
Yeah!

01:31:19.139 --> 01:31:20.371
Hey!

01:31:20.373 --> 01:31:22.476
Here's another one!

01:31:34.154 --> 01:31:35.790
Tom!

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.090
Tom!

01:31:39.092 --> 01:31:41.496
Peony!

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:49.569
Tom! Tom!

01:31:52.805 --> 01:31:54.406
Go inside!
Take cover!

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.440
Tom, help!

01:31:55.442 --> 01:31:58.578
She needs my help.
I'll find you later!

01:31:59.813 --> 01:32:01.916
Tom! Tom!

01:32:45.792 --> 01:32:47.858
Aah!

01:32:57.837 --> 01:32:59.873
Oh...

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:05.112
Oh, my God! Peony!

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.179
My God!

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.692
Hyah!

01:33:53.793 --> 01:33:55.028
Oh!

01:35:22.381 --> 01:35:24.249
Peony!

01:35:25.985 --> 01:35:28.919
Peony, don't give up.

01:35:28.921 --> 01:35:30.354
I need you.

01:35:30.356 --> 01:35:32.126
Our baby needs you.

01:35:39.632 --> 01:35:41.735
Tom...

01:35:45.404 --> 01:35:48.108
Take me to Jin Shan.

01:35:49.042 --> 01:35:50.778
I promise.

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:53.146
We'll go together.

01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:58.049
I love you.

01:35:58.051 --> 01:35:59.286
Please...

01:36:00.119 --> 01:36:01.889
Stay with me.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.029
I... I promise.

01:36:15.668 --> 01:36:19.303
Peony!
Peony!

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:26.180
Peony...

01:36:36.489 --> 01:36:40.795
- Tom, we have to get out of here.
- No!

01:36:41.994 --> 01:36:44.198
I'm not leaving her behind!

01:37:51.163 --> 01:37:53.531
- Grandpa?
- You should thank Grandma.

01:37:53.533 --> 01:37:56.303
She's the one who brought
your necklace from China.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:04.979
I think we should leave and let
Grandpa have some time alone.

01:38:12.485 --> 01:38:17.522
Grandpa, tell me the story
of the jade pendant again.

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:21.793
Of course, sweetheart,
when we get to the restaurant.

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:25.431
Good! Then you can take me
to my kung fu lesson!

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.034
Yes.

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:32.570
But you have to promise me
you won't hurt me.

01:38:32.572 --> 01:38:35.106
Dad, we should go.

01:38:35.108 --> 01:38:38.212
Give me a minute.
Go ahead.

01:38:45.318 --> 01:38:46.550
Don't stay too long.

01:38:46.552 --> 01:38:50.354
She wouldn't want you
to be late for the opening.

01:38:50.356 --> 01:38:53.625
She's been with me
for the other four, Sam.

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.930
She knows I'll be late.

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.332
Go ahead.

01:39:55.432 --> 01:40:00.432
