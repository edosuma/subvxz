Yo... there's a chicken, right there.

01:26.464 --> 01:28.591
That's a duck.
Learn your fowl.

01:28.674 --> 01:30.009
Ducks are good luck.
It's a sign.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.261
-It's not a sign.
-[chuckles]

01:31.344 --> 01:34.597
It's a sign that dude's
having fresh duck for dinner.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.974
Nope. You think I got a shamrock
tattooed on my ass 'cause I'm Irish?

01:37.057 --> 01:39.101
[Poussey] No, 'cause you a dumbass, man.

01:39.185 --> 01:41.729
It's four-leaf clovers that are lucky,
not shamrocks.

-Oh, my God.

Don't give 'em any time to start in

"Our man was doing his job.
This was not about race.

02:42.415 --> 02:44.750
We can't have our inmates
attacking our COs."

02:44.834 --> 02:47.253
She weighed 92 pounds.

02:47.337 --> 02:49.171
She couldn't attack your shoe.

02:49.255 --> 02:52.342
It's not about size.
I knew a Filipino once who could hoist--

02:57.347 --> 02:58.639
Where are the police?

02:58.723 --> 03:02.435
Oh, I haven't called the police.
That's the last thing on the list.

03:08.107 --> 03:10.651
Phones are cut off, TVs are disabled.

03:10.735 --> 03:14.489
And my guys have been told
to brief the other COs on the story.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.657
What story?

03:16.741 --> 03:19.244
What I was telling you
before you interrupted me.

03:19.327 --> 03:23.331
-She was extremely violent. We start--
-Piscatella, go home.

03:24.332 --> 03:26.334
All due respect...

03:26.417 --> 03:28.586
there was an insurrection
in this prison tonight--

03:28.669 --> 03:32.298
There was a peaceful protest
in this prison tonight

03:32.382 --> 03:37.637
that became fatal when the men
under your command got involved.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.224
Someone died on your watch, Captain.

03:41.307 --> 03:43.518
-[sighs]
-A human being.

03:43.601 --> 03:45.561
You better believe
we're gonna look into it.

03:45.645 --> 03:47.563
And we're gonna be hearing many stories.

03:47.647 --> 03:52.109
Not just the story you're telling,
but many stories,

03:52.192 --> 03:56.489
including the one about why you came
to Litchfield in the first place

03:56.572 --> 03:59.409
from the men's high security facility.

04:00.618 --> 04:03.203
Yeah. I did a little digging.

04:04.330 --> 04:07.542
Like I said, get your things
and go home for the weekend.

04:07.625 --> 04:11.796
And if you try to pull any shit
on your way out,

04:11.879 --> 04:14.549
if you try to undermine me in any way,

04:14.632 --> 04:16.966
oh, I will pull skeletons
from your closet.

04:19.053 --> 04:21.055
And throw the fucking gum out!

04:22.096 --> 04:24.434
There's no gum allowed!
Get the hell out of here.

04:25.476 --> 04:27.437
It's disrespectful.

04:35.486 --> 04:37.405
-Dimaguiaba?
-Yeah?

04:39.114 --> 04:40.908
What's happening with the body?

04:40.991 --> 04:42.452
[Dimaguiaba] Well...

04:42.535 --> 04:45.580
I was sent down here
to take and record vitals.

04:45.663 --> 04:48.499
No vitals.
That's what I wrote down.

04:48.583 --> 04:51.001
I'm also supposed to assess injury,

04:51.085 --> 04:53.713
but I'm not exactly sure
how to approach that.

04:53.796 --> 04:56.507
That's why, uh, Foster is here from Max.

04:56.591 --> 04:59.469
-Hey.
-Hello, Foster.

04:59.552 --> 05:04.807
Oh, Captain Piscatella also told us to get
Bayley some diazepam from the med closet.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.976
Should we still go do that?

05:08.268 --> 05:10.187
Bayley's still here?

05:16.068 --> 05:18.363
-What is it?
-Just take it, son.

05:19.739 --> 05:20.865
Here.

05:22.116 --> 05:24.201
Officer Dixon's gonna drive you home.

05:25.285 --> 05:26.412
Okay.

05:27.872 --> 05:30.124
-Bayley, what happened out there?
-[gulps and sighs]

05:30.207 --> 05:33.753
It's... it's all, like, jumpy in my head.

05:33.836 --> 05:37.382
[stammers] I was in the cafeteria,

05:37.465 --> 05:41.511
and Piscatella was telling us
to pull them down.

05:41.594 --> 05:42.970
[sighs]

05:43.053 --> 05:44.346
So...

05:45.347 --> 05:48.976
so, I grabbed someone,
and I was getting hit.

05:49.059 --> 05:50.352
[sniffles]

05:50.436 --> 05:53.188
And then... [sighs] I don't know.

05:54.524 --> 05:55.983
I don't know.

05:57.359 --> 05:59.695
I... I just wanted to help.

06:00.863 --> 06:01.989
Yeah.

06:03.408 --> 06:04.909
Is she gonna be okay?

06:09.747 --> 06:12.583
Man, what the fuck?
Anyone gonna tell us anything?

06:12.667 --> 06:14.251
-Inmate, back to your bunk.
-Or fucking what?

06:14.334 --> 06:15.878
You're gonna kill me?
You're gonna kill all of us?

06:15.961 --> 06:17.713

-but this--
-[Suzanne] No, I'm not.

07:51.599 --> 07:54.309

to not breathe.

12:35.465 --> 12:37.259
sometimes you just don't realize...

12:39.094 --> 12:42.347
I mean, I've sat in chairs
that have broken right under me.

12:44.224 --> 12:45.559
[sobbing]

12:48.228 --> 12:52.482
Listen... I don't know
if this will help or not, but...

12:52.566 --> 12:54.318
[clears throat] in Afghanistan...

12:54.985 --> 12:56.778
I killed some people.

12:56.862 --> 12:58.322
Some innocent people.

13:00.449 --> 13:01.741
People?

13:03.577 --> 13:06.705
So much time spent chasin' after
the bad guys, and then you don't get 'em,

13:06.788 --> 13:10.000
and then they blow up your friends
or shoot up your convoy,

13:10.084 --> 13:13.462
and you just get so mad, tired and bored.

13:14.629 --> 13:16.340
So you just grab a farm kid
from a grape field,

13:16.423 --> 13:19.634
and you make him juggle
live grenades until one of them blows up.

13:19.718 --> 13:21.261
And then you shoot him...

13:21.345 --> 13:24.431
because you don't want him to grow up
without arms or tell on you.

13:25.599 --> 13:29.519
Or maybe you just strangle a girl that
you've had sex with in a small village

13:29.603 --> 13:32.189
because her family's
gonna kill her anyway, right?

13:32.272 --> 13:34.274
And you just gotta get over it.

13:35.609 --> 13:37.069
You have to get over it.

13:38.904 --> 13:42.199
You got so much of your life to live,
and we're so young.

13:44.368 --> 13:48.080
We can't let things like this fuck up
the rest of our long lives.

13:49.373 --> 13:53.085
Now, I didn't see what happened exactly...
but I know you.

13:54.419 --> 13:55.670
Sort of.

13:56.964 --> 13:58.382
You're a good guy.

13:59.799 --> 14:01.176
I'm a good guy.

14:02.677 --> 14:04.388
It was an accident.

14:07.307 --> 14:10.227
Do you think people will forgive me?

14:10.310 --> 14:11.436
Sure.

14:17.484 --> 14:19.904
It's the fourth one on the right.

14:30.873 --> 14:32.082
Thanks for the ride.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.377
Hey, man, listen.

14:35.460 --> 14:38.088
It can get rough, the dreams.

14:40.049 --> 14:41.633
And also being awake.

14:42.968 --> 14:46.138
You're in for some hard times,
but like I said...

14:47.056 --> 14:48.557
you gotta get over it.

15:10.829 --> 15:14.124
Move quickly, ladies.
Thank you.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.625
[sighs]

15:20.422 --> 15:23.050
-How you feeling, Red?
-[Red] How am I feeling?

15:23.133 --> 15:25.510
Better now that
I've gotten a little sleep,

15:25.594 --> 15:28.931
but my back hurts a lot,
my soul hurts a little...

15:30.640 --> 15:33.310
and I have to make sure
that if they're killing us now,

15:33.393 --> 15:34.937
they don't kill one of mine.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.813
You really think
you can do something about it?

15:36.896 --> 15:39.858
I think I can make them feel safe.

15:39.942 --> 15:42.945
Whether they actually are
is another story.

15:43.028 --> 15:45.405
Well, here's a thought.

15:45.489 --> 15:48.158
We got one of theirs,
they got one of ours. Now we're even.

15:48.242 --> 15:50.910
Ha! Nice thought.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.790
[McCullough] Oh, no.

15:57.001 --> 15:58.793
Uh, we got a problem.

16:00.337 --> 16:01.880
[Red] What now?

16:08.095 --> 16:11.640
Anyone have eyes on Piscatella?
I need him in the cafeteria now.

16:11.723 --> 16:13.392
[in Spanish]
When people come to breakfast,

16:13.475 --> 16:15.019
this will really put them off their food.

16:15.102 --> 16:17.354
[Dayanara in English]
How could they not move it?

16:17.437 --> 16:20.315
-They don't know what to do.
-They need to call the police.

16:20.399 --> 16:22.151
They ain't gonna call the police.
They ain't doin' shit.

16:22.234 --> 16:23.610
Fuck, the girl was murdered.

16:23.693 --> 16:25.070
Leaving her like this,

16:25.154 --> 16:26.655
you'd think they'd have
some humanness in them.

16:26.738 --> 16:28.490
[scoffs] You think?

16:28.573 --> 16:30.367
[in Spanish] Fuck! I stepped in gum.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.619
Who the fuck had gum?

16:32.702 --> 16:35.289
Okay, ladies, go back into the kitchen.

16:35.372 --> 16:37.374
I'll take it from here.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.918
Someone please come
to the cafeteria and wait with me.

16:40.002 --> 16:41.920
Hello?

16:42.004 --> 16:44.048
You've got maybe one more day

16:44.131 --> 16:47.551
before bloat and putrefaction
begin with the corpse.

16:47.634 --> 16:50.887
After that, this room
will smell forever like death.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.431
How do you know that?

16:53.557 --> 16:55.017
Actually, I don't want to know.

16:56.018 --> 16:57.644
Has anyone got eyes on the captain?

16:57.727 --> 17:00.147
[McCullough on radio] <i>Anyone?</i>

17:00.230 --> 17:01.440
<i>Please.</i>

17:05.569 --> 17:07.154
Caputo here.

17:07.237 --> 17:09.031
[clears throat] Caputo here.
What's going on?

17:09.114 --> 17:12.492
Sir, this is McCullough in the dining hall
where breakfast is about to start.

17:12.576 --> 17:15.037
Um... there's still
a certain inmate present,

17:15.119 --> 17:19.208
um, who's sure to cause certain problems
once meal service commences.

17:19.290 --> 17:21.042
[stammers] Wait, what?

17:21.126 --> 17:23.252
Sir, the body is still here.

17:25.922 --> 17:27.507
No one goes in there.
You hear me?

17:27.590 --> 17:29.718
No one goes in there!
I'm coming down!

17:44.691 --> 17:48.278
-Look who's up bright and early.
-It's a new me.

17:48.362 --> 17:49.863
Is it really?

17:49.946 --> 17:52.699
Uh, the kids are callin' it
"lockdown rapid detox."

17:52.782 --> 17:56.245
And then yesterday, I mean...
Jesus.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.955
Talk about sobering.

18:00.249 --> 18:02.251
Well, I hope it sticks.

18:04.253 --> 18:06.213
Should I bring some of these
to the grieving family?

18:06.296 --> 18:08.047
I'll have someone else bring them.

18:08.673 --> 18:12.344
What you can do is tell our family
that we're all meeting after breakfast,

18:12.427 --> 18:14.012
out by the garden.

18:14.096 --> 18:17.099
What was the garden.
As close to the garden as we can.

18:17.182 --> 18:19.601
Okay?
Will you tell everyone?

18:19.684 --> 18:23.272
So, uh, what... you don't...
you don't trust me to bring the juice?

18:23.355 --> 18:25.940
I don't think
you're going to steal it, Nicky.

18:27.025 --> 18:29.194
-This is a situation where--
-What?

18:30.195 --> 18:33.490
Huh? Say it.
I can take it.

18:33.573 --> 18:34.866
Death is uncomfortable.

18:34.949 --> 18:37.869
And when you get uncomfortable,
you talk too much.

18:37.952 --> 18:41.415
I don't want you going over there making
jokes or saying something really stupid

18:41.498 --> 18:44.626
like, "She's in a better place,"
or, "Everything happens for a reason."

18:44.709 --> 18:45.919
You don't mean to,

18:46.002 --> 18:48.880
but you try to fill the space
because that's what you do.

18:48.963 --> 18:51.425
It's not a judgment.
It's only...

18:51.508 --> 18:52.717
I know you.

18:52.801 --> 18:54.093
[scoffs]

18:55.094 --> 18:57.597
You do.
You know me.

18:58.390 --> 19:02.352
All right. I'm gonna go tell everyone
about the after-breakfast thing.

19:02.436 --> 19:03.812
Thank you, honey.

19:07.649 --> 19:09.151
Are you proud of me, Red?

19:09.234 --> 19:13.155
I am cautiously optimistic.

19:17.409 --> 19:20.662
'Cause black lives don't matter.
That's why.

19:20.745 --> 19:22.747
She's still lying in there.

19:22.831 --> 19:25.375
They don't even have the respect
to take her away.

19:26.376 --> 19:28.295
And look at this shit.

19:30.255 --> 19:31.798
Don't mean nothing.

19:34.218 --> 19:35.760
They didn't know her.

19:37.095 --> 19:39.598
Hey, is that a Heath bar?
Hand that over.

19:39.681 --> 19:42.184
Hand it--
What? [scoffs]

19:42.267 --> 19:45.103
You rage, I eat.
We all have our way.

19:45.187 --> 19:48.690
-People are trying to be nice.
-People are full of shit.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.486
Uh, who brought that bubble water maker?

19:52.569 --> 19:56.030
Not her.
The skinny one bought it.

19:56.114 --> 19:58.700
Yeah... people are full of shit.

19:58.783 --> 20:02.161
-How heavy you think this bench is?
-Stop it, Suzanne. Please.

20:02.246 --> 20:03.913
I can't.
Not today.

20:03.997 --> 20:07.209
I find you with this bench upside down
on your titties, I'mma lose it!

20:07.959 --> 20:08.960
I swear.

20:11.630 --> 20:13.882
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:15.384 --> 20:18.637
She was a good kid.
And if you're having a send-off for her,

20:18.720 --> 20:21.306
I'd like to contribute
one of my commissary casseroles.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.267
It looks disgusting, but it tastes good.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.977
I just need a few hours heads-up.

20:26.060 --> 20:29.314
Gotta get some ingredients
and some real time with the microwave.

20:29.398 --> 20:31.566
I wanna do that for you.

20:31.650 --> 20:34.319
You don't know what we're going through.

20:35.404 --> 20:37.781
You don't know what this is like for us.

20:37.864 --> 20:41.451
And now you come around wantin'
to make some ugly-ass casserole?

20:41.535 --> 20:42.702
Yo!

20:42.786 --> 20:44.954
Like that's gonna make
everything all right?

20:46.080 --> 20:50.126
I think what she's trying to say is,
"Thank you. It's very thoughtful."

20:50.209 --> 20:51.795
I get it.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.589
When my cousin Nino got shot
and dumped in the Gowanus Canal,

20:54.673 --> 20:58.510
my brother took a bat and whacked
every bald-headed guy he came across.

20:58.593 --> 21:02.013
Then it turned out
it wasn't even Bald Mario who'd done it.

21:02.096 --> 21:05.725
It was Nino's girlfriend's father,
who had a full head of hair,

21:05.809 --> 21:08.853
and was mad about Nino
not putting his name

21:08.937 --> 21:11.856
on the birth certificate for the baby!

21:11.940 --> 21:13.358
Oy, was that a mess.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.027
Anyhow...

21:17.321 --> 21:18.738
condolences.

21:25.329 --> 21:28.457
I keep thinkin' she gonna come
around that corner any minute now,

21:28.540 --> 21:32.001
-and be all, "Hey, party people!"
-[all chuckle]

21:32.085 --> 21:34.296
That goofy smile.

21:37.173 --> 21:39.551
Man, it still ain't real, you know?

21:39.634 --> 21:40.844
I gotta go to work.

21:42.136 --> 21:44.180
But it's Saturday.

21:44.263 --> 21:47.434
You tell that Caputo
to call the fucking cops!

21:47.517 --> 21:50.061
You tell them to arrest
that murdering guard

21:50.144 --> 21:53.022
and get our girl off the floor, Taystee!

21:53.106 --> 21:54.316
You tell them!

21:54.399 --> 21:56.234
This shit ain't right!

22:00.572 --> 22:02.031
[Josh] <i>She never even had a cold.</i>

22:02.115 --> 22:04.117
Visits to medical, none.
What do you got?

22:04.200 --> 22:05.327
Non-violent offender

22:05.410 --> 22:08.747
picked up in Brooklyn for trespassing
and possession with intent to sell.

22:08.830 --> 22:11.082
Oh. [sighs]

22:11.165 --> 22:13.251
Not even half an ounce.

22:13.335 --> 22:15.211
It's all soft.
Even her intake photo is adorable.

22:15.294 --> 22:16.338
Shit.

22:17.922 --> 22:19.466
Go online.
Facebook, Twitter.

22:19.549 --> 22:22.552
See if anything she posted
could be interpreted as threatening.

22:22.636 --> 22:23.845
I don't see the point in any of this.

22:23.928 --> 22:27.391
I need to call the police,
and I need that body out of my cafeteria.

22:27.474 --> 22:29.601
Yeah, we'll call the police
the second we have an angle.

22:30.894 --> 22:32.270
Okay? We're talking about death here.

22:32.353 --> 22:34.398
And if we can't prove
that it was either motivated

22:34.481 --> 22:37.275
or due to a preexisting condition,
the MCC becomes liable.

22:37.358 --> 22:40.695
Now, we need to be able to guide
our brothers in blue when they get here,

22:40.779 --> 22:42.447
not to mention the press.

22:42.531 --> 22:45.283
So... you wanna have a seat?

22:45.366 --> 22:47.201
Go through some files?
See if we missed anything?

22:47.285 --> 22:50.121
Asthma attack?
A violent outburst? Something?

22:50.204 --> 22:54.083
There was no condition
and it wasn't motivated.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.335
It was an accident.

22:57.128 --> 22:59.255
Better yet... we'll handle it.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.466
Hey! This is my fucking prison.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.843
And you should go run it.

23:03.927 --> 23:06.471
We'll call you when we're ready
and we'll go over everything.

23:06.555 --> 23:08.890
Then we will get
the police over here, pronto.

23:08.973 --> 23:11.059
Phones are still cut off, right?

23:11.142 --> 23:13.520
No one's coming in?
Everyone's locked down?

23:13.603 --> 23:15.522
The phones are off.

23:15.605 --> 23:18.066
And I canceled visitation,
but I lifted the lockdown.

23:18.149 --> 23:19.984
These women shouldn't have
to sit trapped in their bunks.

23:20.068 --> 23:21.235
[scoffs] Okay.

23:21.319 --> 23:25.031
Hey! Nothing happens without my approval.
You hear me?

23:25.114 --> 23:26.991
We'll make sure
you're comfortable with everything.

23:27.075 --> 23:28.326
Okay?

23:29.243 --> 23:30.454
[typing]

23:31.287 --> 23:34.248
Oh, um...
Judy King's being released today.

23:35.542 --> 23:36.585
What?

23:36.668 --> 23:38.878
We can't have her around when this breaks.

23:38.962 --> 23:41.214
In fact, we're trying
to backdate the paperwork.

23:41.297 --> 23:43.382
Yeah, we'll talk to her,
make sure she'll cooperate,

23:43.467 --> 23:45.301
say she was already gone
when all this happened.

23:45.384 --> 23:46.845
I'm sure she doesn't
want the headache either.

23:46.928 --> 23:49.138
Jesus Christ!

23:50.139 --> 23:52.892
Check it!
This picture's pretty thuggy.

23:54.185 --> 23:57.021
Yeah, maybe,
if we photoshop out the bunny ears.

23:57.105 --> 23:58.815
Pull it. We'll see.

24:02.193 --> 24:03.653
[Poussey] You gave me bunny ears?

24:03.737 --> 24:05.697
No. No, wait. No, no, no.
You can't post it!

24:05.780 --> 24:07.323
-[laughing] Too late.
-Ugh.

24:07.406 --> 24:09.242
Man, Ali, you straight killin' my vibe!

24:09.325 --> 24:11.119
Aw, shit.

24:11.202 --> 24:13.622
Wait, am I really baked,
or am I reading that right?

24:13.705 --> 24:17.166
[Poussey] Yo, my weed
don't make "S's" "Z's," man. That's a "Z."

24:17.250 --> 24:19.669
-That's "Rootz" with a "Z"!
-No fuckin' way.

24:19.753 --> 24:21.295
My cousin CeeCee said she seen 'em here.

24:21.379 --> 24:23.006
Even got a drumstick signed
by Questlove to prove it.

24:23.089 --> 24:25.842
-Questlove with a "K" maybe.
-Wait, wait, wait. CeeCee, right?

24:25.925 --> 24:28.762
The one who interned with Jay Z?
That one?

24:28.845 --> 24:31.264
Yeah, they don't call her Fox News
'cause she foxy.

24:31.347 --> 24:34.308
Shit. Lying liar lie person.

24:34.392 --> 24:36.686
-Fuck!
-[Poussey grunts]

24:36.770 --> 24:38.563
-[man] Good evening, New York!
-[crowd cheering]

24:39.939 --> 24:42.400
We are The Rootz!

24:42.483 --> 24:43.735
[crowd cheering]

24:45.153 --> 24:46.445
[music playing]

24:49.282 --> 24:52.118
Man, The Roots all got
some serious vitiligo, man.

24:52.201 --> 24:54.037
-That Michael Jackson thing?
-Oh, no.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.372
I did not pay good money
to see some white Roots cover band.

24:56.455 --> 24:57.666
Where is the manager?

24:57.749 --> 25:00.835
Yeah, you go get him, Aliyah!
And tell him to buy us some damn drinks!

25:00.919 --> 25:03.922
Yeah! Let's pop some Cris in this mo'!

25:04.005 --> 25:05.131
No, no. No, no, no.

25:05.214 --> 25:07.592
You... you can't say that.
That... that is stupid.

25:07.676 --> 25:11.095
You're just mad 'cause this some
American-style bullshit!

25:12.388 --> 25:13.723
Yo, wait, hold up.

25:15.266 --> 25:16.976
[chuckles] You got it?
You got it?

25:17.060 --> 25:20.564
[laughing] Yeah, I got you, man...

25:22.065 --> 25:23.858
Hey, hey!
Man, he got my phone!

25:24.776 --> 25:27.361
She came right at him.
I saw it.

25:27.445 --> 25:29.698
You know, I didn't think
the little potato had it in him.

25:29.781 --> 25:31.490
You should've seen him in the car.
He was a wreck.

25:31.575 --> 25:34.202
Blake said that
she was foaming at the mouth.

25:35.036 --> 25:38.081
-[metal detector beeping]
-Oh, whoa, whoa! Come back.

25:39.332 --> 25:41.585
[metal detector beeping]

25:41.668 --> 25:42.919
Come here.

25:48.257 --> 25:50.594
Dude, I can't...

25:50.677 --> 25:52.762
-I can't let you go in there with that.
-Sure you can.

25:52.846 --> 25:55.724
-I just keep walking.
-No.

25:55.807 --> 25:59.393
It's <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> in there right now.
Not the kind we like to jack off to.

25:59.477 --> 26:01.312
A guy's gotta be able to defend himself.

26:01.395 --> 26:05.191
From what? A five-foot chick
who is probably in for cyber-squattin'?

26:05.274 --> 26:06.317
I heard she had a knife.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.070
-Did you see her foam at the mouth?
-Sure.

26:09.946 --> 26:12.573
Look, we gotta stand behind
our man with a strong story.

26:12.657 --> 26:16.620
Too many contradictions,
and we'll all be open for investigation.

26:16.703 --> 26:18.204
Do you wanna find yourself explaining

26:18.287 --> 26:21.290
why you had a girl standing on a table,
pissing herself?

26:21.374 --> 26:22.416
[clears throat]

26:22.500 --> 26:25.419
Listen, you guys got
this cush assignment here.

26:25.503 --> 26:28.506
I'm headed back into the lady lions' den,
and they're out for blood.

26:28.589 --> 26:31.801
It's actually the female lions
that do the huntin'.

26:31.885 --> 26:33.594
The guys just sit around
lickin' themselves.

26:33.678 --> 26:35.096
Well, there you go then.

26:36.389 --> 26:37.598
I'm gonna keep walking now.

26:41.519 --> 26:43.271
[metal detector beeping]

26:49.360 --> 26:50.862
Oh. Um...

26:52.781 --> 26:55.449
You didn't have to come in today.
It's... it's a weekend--

26:55.533 --> 26:57.994
No. I wanna be here.

26:58.077 --> 27:01.414
See what I can do to help.
[sighs] Keep busy.

27:01.497 --> 27:04.751
Right. Well...
I'm not sure what I got for you.

27:04.834 --> 27:09.172
Um, maybe I can call the police
or the coroner?

27:09.255 --> 27:11.299
Uh, I can pull up their numbers right now.

27:11.382 --> 27:16.137
Right. Well, um... MCC is...
It's just, they're not ready for that yet.

27:17.388 --> 27:21.642
So she lie there alone on the ground
like an old napkin?

27:22.560 --> 27:24.520
That ain't right, Mr. Caputo.

27:24.603 --> 27:27.899
No... it's not.

27:27.982 --> 27:31.027
[sighs]
But it is a crime scene.

27:31.110 --> 27:34.823
So where's the criminal?
He in jail?

27:34.906 --> 27:40.411
[sighs] Taystee, if you want to stay here,
you're gonna have to give me a break.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.914
I'm doing the best I can.

27:42.997 --> 27:45.416
She's not alone.
I posted a guard.

27:45.499 --> 27:48.086
I had inmates put up privacy blankets.

27:49.003 --> 27:51.005
I'm trying to take care of her.

27:51.089 --> 27:52.465
Mr. Caputo?

27:53.507 --> 27:55.509
Is her daddy coming?

27:55.593 --> 27:57.553
Um, he's, uh...

27:58.847 --> 28:00.598
I'm not...

28:00.681 --> 28:03.642
You haven't even called her dad yet?

28:05.269 --> 28:06.479
Are you kidding me?

28:06.562 --> 28:10.859
I'm gonna call him right now.
I will call... now.

28:34.507 --> 28:37.927
I don't have her file.
It's in with the crisis management team.

28:38.011 --> 28:41.765
But as soon as I get it, I will call him.
I promise you.

28:41.848 --> 28:45.727
I'll call Serena in registration
and see if she can track something down.

28:45.810 --> 28:49.814
Great. That's a great idea.
Excellent. Excellent idea.

28:49.898 --> 28:52.025
I will be right back.

28:54.903 --> 28:56.570
It's a terrible day.

29:01.325 --> 29:03.619
[Big Boo and Pennsatucky
conversing indistinctly]

29:03.702 --> 29:05.914
[Big Boo] They're gonna probably
make us clean that.

29:05.997 --> 29:07.456
Whoa. Stop. Stop.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.708
You're gonna run over the...
[sniffles] Stop.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.503
Holy cow.

29:12.586 --> 29:14.088
I have to watch her till the cops come.

29:14.172 --> 29:17.341
How perfect for you.
An inmate you can totally control.

29:17.425 --> 29:18.802
That's not funny.

29:21.554 --> 29:22.555
[Coates sniffles]

29:22.638 --> 29:24.891
We're just here to hang
some stuff up over the grates

29:24.974 --> 29:27.643
so nobody can, like, look in.

29:27.726 --> 29:30.146
-Give her some privacy.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.481
Does it matter at this point? [scoffs]

29:32.565 --> 29:35.819
I mean, I guess the ghost of her
could be hangin' around, right?

29:36.485 --> 29:37.987
I mean, my uncle Kyle...

29:38.071 --> 29:41.657
when he had... when he OD'd
and his body ended up in the river,

29:41.740 --> 29:45.619
he came to my room every night
and he stole all my shit.

29:45.703 --> 29:46.955
[scoffs]

29:48.081 --> 29:49.082
You know what, though?

29:49.165 --> 29:51.625
It could've been Kacey,
his... his brother,

29:51.709 --> 29:54.712
because they looked exactly alike.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.049
Yup, he kyped my entire coin collection.

29:58.132 --> 30:00.301
-Oh, then it was definitely the ghost.
-Yeah.

30:00.384 --> 30:03.762
See, he needed the coins to pay
for passage across the Styx.

30:03.847 --> 30:06.099
I didn't grow up in the sticks.
I grew up in town.

30:06.182 --> 30:09.185
I love playing this game with you.
It really never gets old.

30:10.311 --> 30:12.646
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

30:12.730 --> 30:14.858
-You sure?
-All good.

30:14.941 --> 30:17.151
[sniffles] Damn it. I'm sorry.

30:17.235 --> 30:19.237
-No, no.
-[softly] Damn it.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.030
Do you want to go talk or something?

30:22.240 --> 30:24.450
Go set up the ladder.

30:24.533 --> 30:27.328
Okay... but don't go too far.

30:27.411 --> 30:30.999
-I'll be waiting, if you know what I mean.
-You'll be waiting.

30:31.082 --> 30:33.001
He knows what I mean.

30:37.881 --> 30:40.258
Are you gonna be freaked out in here,
with this body?

30:40.341 --> 30:43.802
Nah. It's only the living
that scare the fuck out of me.

30:48.474 --> 30:52.561
"The garden is one of the two
great metaphors for humanity.

30:52.645 --> 30:58.067
The garden is about life and beauty
and the impermanence of all living things.

30:58.817 --> 31:03.364
The garden is about feeding your children,
providing food for the tribe.

31:03.447 --> 31:06.200
It's part of an urgent territorial drive

31:06.284 --> 31:10.246
that we can probably trace back
to animals storing food.

31:10.329 --> 31:15.043
It's a competitive display mechanism,
like having a prize bull,

31:15.126 --> 31:19.130
this greed for the best tomatoes
and English tea roses.

31:19.213 --> 31:24.510
It's about winning, about providing
society with superior things,

31:24.593 --> 31:30.934
and about proving that you have taste,
and good values and you work hard.

31:31.017 --> 31:35.396
And what a wonderful relief,
every so often, to know who the enemy is.

31:35.479 --> 31:39.150
Because in the garden,
the enemy is everything.

31:39.233 --> 31:42.320
The aphids, the weather, time.

31:42.403 --> 31:47.075
And so you pour yourself into it,
care so much,

31:47.158 --> 31:50.244
and see up close so much birth,
and growth,

31:50.328 --> 31:53.789
and beauty, and danger, and triumph.

31:53.872 --> 31:56.250
And then everything dies anyway, right?"

31:56.334 --> 31:59.087
-[chuckles]
-"But you just keep doing it."

32:01.797 --> 32:05.676
Washington showed me this
when I started the garden.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.470
She thought I'd like it.

32:09.222 --> 32:10.598
I do.

32:10.681 --> 32:13.684
[inhales deeply]
We're going to start again.

32:13.767 --> 32:17.021
For our humanity, for this family,

32:17.105 --> 32:20.399
and for that little girl
on the floor in the cafeteria.

32:20.483 --> 32:23.569
-Where?
-[Gina] The cafeteria. She's still there.

32:23.652 --> 32:25.363
That's why we had breakfast outside.

32:25.446 --> 32:29.117
I know that. I'm saying where
are we gonna redo the garden?

32:29.200 --> 32:32.828
Well, I was thinking by the fence...
where the hole was.

32:32.911 --> 32:37.000
We can dig up some of the grass,
make a patch for ourselves.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.043
Well, they're gonna think
we're trying to split again.

32:39.127 --> 32:41.337
How about, uh, near electrical?
There's sun.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.588
Luschek won't give a shit.

32:42.671 --> 32:45.633
It's too open
and the Latinas like to sunbathe there.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.926
What about, uh,
the make-out alley by the shed?

32:48.011 --> 32:50.929
I mean, all that heavy breathing
should be good for the plants.

32:51.014 --> 32:55.309
Mmm, good. [chuckles]
Nicky, Lorna, you two scout that, hmm?

32:56.602 --> 33:00.273
Gina, Anita, Norma,
I need you to make lists.

33:00.356 --> 33:02.358
What do we need?
Where can we get it?

33:02.441 --> 33:05.444
Who are our allies in the administration
who might help us?

33:05.528 --> 33:09.573
How can we protect ourselves
and the garden? All of that.

33:09.657 --> 33:11.117
Chapman and Vause...

33:11.200 --> 33:14.037
Well, what about
if we poke around the old garden,

33:14.120 --> 33:16.789
and then somehow break
into the greenhouse?

33:16.872 --> 33:18.332
I think that there's a guard posted there.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.251
Yeah, but we'll be stealthy.

33:20.334 --> 33:22.795
And he's the guy who sneaks
his game thingy. I've been watching.

33:26.715 --> 33:29.343
Okay, team, get to work.

33:35.349 --> 33:36.517
[Frieda] No job for me?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.687
I need you to help me up.
I think I'm stuck down here. [chuckles]

33:39.770 --> 33:41.105
[Frieda chuckles]

33:42.565 --> 33:44.733
Ow! Jesus.

33:44.817 --> 33:46.944
What are you really up to, Red?

33:47.986 --> 33:51.032
When my boys were little
and we lived in a shit neighborhood,

33:51.115 --> 33:52.366
I kept them busy.

33:52.450 --> 33:56.162
Busy, busy. Sports, chores,
board games, outings,

33:56.245 --> 33:58.789
music, pillow forts,
anything I could think of.

33:58.872 --> 34:02.960
Because busy boys
don't have the time to get into trouble.

34:03.044 --> 34:06.505
I smell trouble coming.
I want this family busy.

34:06.589 --> 34:09.342
What is that? "Poussey"?

34:10.467 --> 34:12.969
Is that, like, French or somethin'?

34:13.971 --> 34:18.809
I mean, is she... a black French?

34:20.768 --> 34:22.396
-[sighs]
-What?

34:24.273 --> 34:25.774
What?

34:33.366 --> 34:34.824
[moaning] Uh-uh.

34:34.908 --> 34:38.621
No, no, no, no.
No. No. No. No!

34:38.704 --> 34:40.331
-No! No!
-Come on!

34:40.414 --> 34:42.375
I'm clean.

34:42.458 --> 34:44.502
-Oh, what? I'm... I'm your prize?
-Mmm-hmm.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.920
Your prize for gettin' clean?
Is that what I am?

34:47.004 --> 34:50.007
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you? I am married!

34:50.091 --> 34:52.176
We're having a baby!

34:52.260 --> 34:54.969
[scoffing] No, you're not, you know?

34:55.053 --> 34:56.639
I... That's...

34:56.722 --> 34:58.182
You're not! [laughs]

34:59.475 --> 35:02.145
Yes... I am!

35:02.228 --> 35:05.523
[breath trembling] You junkie...

35:05.606 --> 35:08.734
addict... liar!

35:09.902 --> 35:12.113
Yeah, you like that?

35:12.196 --> 35:15.241
How long is it gonna last... this time?

35:16.325 --> 35:20.829
What are you gonna Sweet 'N Low for it?
'Cause it ain't gonna be me. No, sir.

35:22.498 --> 35:24.417
You psycho!

35:24.500 --> 35:28.921
[shouts] What's the truth?
What's the truth, huh? What's going on?

35:29.004 --> 35:30.298
I... I wanna know!

35:30.381 --> 35:34.218
I mean, what kinda contortions
are your brain acrobats

35:34.302 --> 35:36.179
doin' up there
in your fuckin' head circus, huh?

35:36.262 --> 35:37.971
[breathing heavily]

35:39.223 --> 35:40.516
I'm...

35:42.226 --> 35:44.895
I'm fucking everything up, okay?

35:45.979 --> 35:49.066
-[breathing heavily]
-It's happening... again.

35:49.150 --> 35:53.362
I'm watchin' it happening
and I can't stop myself.

35:53.446 --> 35:56.282
[crying] And he's gonna
leave me 'cause of it.

35:56.365 --> 35:59.827
And then what'll it do? I do.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.913
[shouting] What'll I do?

36:02.996 --> 36:04.415
You... you happy now?

36:04.498 --> 36:08.169
-You happy 'cause it's ruined now? Yes?
-[laughs] No, of course not, okay?

36:08.252 --> 36:10.838
Come on. [scoffs]
A junkie addict liar, eh?

36:10.921 --> 36:12.715
Happy people are not that.

36:12.798 --> 36:15.426
[exhales and sniffs]

36:18.346 --> 36:19.555
[sighs]

36:20.639 --> 36:23.184
I wonder if she's got family.

36:23.267 --> 36:24.768
Who?

36:24.852 --> 36:27.980
You know, Washington.
The French black, RIP.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.399
-Oh.
-[scoffs] Hell.

He asked me to tell her friends that
he's sorry and that it was an accident.

37:13.901 --> 37:16.445
Oh, no, no.
You can't do that.

37:16.529 --> 37:20.324

Maybe it would bring them some relief,
just knowing it was an accident.

He's not a bad guy.

-Nothing. I couldn't reach it.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.519
[woman on PA speaking indistinctly]

50:21.396 --> 50:24.357
I'm a fuckin' hero, bitches.

50:25.483 --> 50:28.986
Yeah, I held it together and saved a life.

50:31.364 --> 50:35.202
But now I'm gonna go back
to crying now, so...

50:36.578 --> 50:37.662
Bye.

50:39.539 --> 50:41.666
Holy shit.
She's drunk.

50:41.749 --> 50:45.128
And where there's drunk, there's drink.

50:46.296 --> 50:48.965
-[Leanne] Yes!
-[both chuckling]

50:52.260 --> 50:56.139
We need to call the police.
We need to call the coroner now!

50:56.223 --> 50:58.516
All right. I think I got it.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.603
Okay, we hit a wall
when it came to the inmate.

51:01.686 --> 51:03.062
Father's an army mucky-muck,

51:03.146 --> 51:08.025
nice family, educated, low-level crime,
sweet face, healthy as a fuckin' horse.

51:08.110 --> 51:10.320
-Wasn't happening.
-We'd be smeared.

51:10.403 --> 51:12.364
We're shifting our focus
to Officer Bayley.

51:12.447 --> 51:15.450
-What do you mean?
-A villain.

51:15.533 --> 51:17.244
We got a villain.

51:17.327 --> 51:19.621
He was untrained and a loose cannon,

51:19.704 --> 51:23.333
who, as you will announce,
will be fired, effective immediately.

51:23.416 --> 51:25.627
He wasn't a loose cannon.

51:26.544 --> 51:29.631
He's a kid who got scared.

51:29.714 --> 51:32.467
And killed someone.
How long you been working here?

51:32.550 --> 51:34.177
Thirty years.

51:34.261 --> 51:36.471
Been scared once or twice?
What's your body count?

51:37.680 --> 51:40.142
He is not a villain.

51:40.225 --> 51:42.560
We leave him out there
to twist in the wind,

51:42.644 --> 51:43.895
he will go to jail.

51:44.812 --> 51:46.606
Well, he made his bed
when he did a full nelson

51:46.689 --> 51:48.650
on a girl he had 50 pounds on.

51:48.733 --> 51:50.067
He had his knee on her.

51:51.819 --> 51:55.198
-You said "full nelson."
-I wasn't being literal.

51:55.282 --> 51:56.658
-Yeah.
-[scoffs]

51:56.741 --> 51:59.577
She was unarmed,
and by all reports, non-aggressive.

51:59.661 --> 52:04.374
He was using brawn instead of brain,
and that is not a tactic MCC can stand by.

52:04.457 --> 52:07.627
Ooh, write that down.
Could be useful for the statement.

52:07.710 --> 52:10.547
"Brawn instead of brain.
MCC won't stand for it."

52:10.630 --> 52:14.301
-Plus, he's on antidepressants.
-Who isn't?

52:14.384 --> 52:16.969
[Josh] He went rogue.
It's our only defense.

52:17.053 --> 52:19.181
You can call the cops and the morgue now.

52:19.264 --> 52:21.308
That'll give us a few hours
until the press gets a hold of it,

52:21.391 --> 52:23.810
and then we'll have ourselves
an official conference.

52:23.893 --> 52:25.061
Here we go!

52:35.071 --> 52:36.823
[indistinct chatter]

52:52.088 --> 52:53.465
[all laughing]

53:24.246 --> 53:28.040
[woman on PA] <i>Doors opening.</i>
<i>Step back to allow customers to exit.</i>

53:28.124 --> 53:30.543
<i>When boarding,</i>
<i>please move to the center of the car.</i>

53:30.627 --> 53:32.837
<i>Step back, doors closing.</i>

53:33.880 --> 53:38.426
[in sing-song] Where the fuck am I?
Where the...

53:39.344 --> 53:42.930
-Hey, uh, which way to John Street?
-It's, like, five blocks that way.

53:43.014 --> 53:44.098
That way?

53:45.099 --> 53:47.226
[bicycle bells ringing]

53:49.312 --> 53:50.355
You lost?

53:50.438 --> 53:53.107
No. I'm... like, five blocks away.

53:54.025 --> 53:56.235
About... I think.

53:56.319 --> 53:57.779
Hop on.
We'll get you there.

54:01.366 --> 54:02.742
[chuckling]

54:08.205 --> 54:09.248
[bells ringing]

54:09.332 --> 54:12.502
[laughing] Oh, my God.
Oh, man.

54:14.962 --> 54:16.506
[Poussey] Whoo!

54:18.550 --> 54:20.468
[Poussey laughs and cheers]

54:22.304 --> 54:23.846
[bells chiming]

54:30.562 --> 54:33.147
Breeze feels nice. Mmm.

54:33.230 --> 54:36.318
I gotta replenish my vitamin D
so I don't get dementia.

54:36.401 --> 54:39.446
You ain't gettin' dementia.
You forget nothing.

54:39.529 --> 54:40.863
And don't you forget it.

54:42.990 --> 54:45.242
Things will change now, you know.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.869
That's what's so fucked up.

54:46.953 --> 54:48.996
It takes someone dying
for them to do something.

54:50.540 --> 54:52.166
They ain't gonna do shit.

54:54.461 --> 54:56.170
Shit, now that's a big one.

54:56.253 --> 54:59.382
I haven't seen Mandingirl
around here before.

54:59.466 --> 55:03.135
Heard he-she was in Max.
Beat up a Mexican or something.

55:03.219 --> 55:05.597
Looks like it's all peace
in the valley now. [chuckles]

55:05.680 --> 55:07.056
Maybe they got it sedated.

55:07.139 --> 55:08.224
-[Sankey laughs]
-Fuck.

55:08.307 --> 55:10.518
Can we wake it back up
if the guards go apeshit?

55:10.602 --> 55:13.312
I want that on my side
if they try and squash me.

55:13.396 --> 55:15.690
-Too vivid.
-[Sankey laughing]

55:17.066 --> 55:18.901
I'm sorry for your loss.

55:19.736 --> 55:23.114
Hey, you're the table-standing,
pissed-on-herself lady, right?

55:23.656 --> 55:24.782
Yeah.

55:39.213 --> 55:40.256
Okay.

55:49.181 --> 55:51.684
That bitch can stand
for a hella long time.

55:54.061 --> 55:55.897
We gotta find that hooch.

55:55.980 --> 55:58.315
I mean, ain't much of a wake
without drink.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.817
[scoffs]

55:59.901 --> 56:02.236
China Doll probably know
where she kept it.

56:02.319 --> 56:03.613
-I mean, where she at anyhow?
-Mmm-hmm.

56:03.696 --> 56:06.323
I mean, some of this candy for her,
bein' that she the widow and all.

56:06.408 --> 56:09.619
-Then save her some.
-Fuck off, Shabazz.

56:09.702 --> 56:12.038
Suzanne went to look for her.

56:12.121 --> 56:14.749
Hopefully not dead in the library.

56:14.832 --> 56:17.043
P ain't here to save her ass no more.

56:19.962 --> 56:22.840
Someone should sing.
Don't people sing at these things?

56:22.924 --> 56:25.259
Me and Taystee gonna sing.

56:25.342 --> 56:28.846
A little "Goin' Up Yonder,"
a little "Bye and Bye."

56:28.930 --> 56:33.851
Some Sounds of Blackness, "I'll Fly Away."
Or Hezekiah Walker, "I'll Fly Away."

56:35.227 --> 56:38.147
I mean, I may be a Jew now,
but times like this

56:38.230 --> 56:40.983
call for some black gospel,
no matter what.

56:41.067 --> 56:44.529
[Janae chuckling] P...
P had some pipes.

56:44.612 --> 56:46.322
Oh... hell, yeah.

56:47.740 --> 56:49.909
I mean, that voice would take you places.

56:51.243 --> 56:54.163
But that she-wee thing, though,
was for shit, though.

56:54.246 --> 56:57.374
-[both laughing]
-Yo...

56:58.626 --> 57:00.920
I pissed all over my hands.

57:03.005 --> 57:04.340
[sniffles]

57:06.759 --> 57:08.094
[voice breaking] Fuck, man.

57:10.221 --> 57:11.931
[crying] Man, fuck!

57:16.894 --> 57:19.439
-What'd they say?
-Not much.

57:19.522 --> 57:21.441
[in Spanish]
When we can get back in the kitchen

57:21.524 --> 57:25.236
we should make them
chilaquiles or something.

57:25.319 --> 57:27.279
Should we tell the big one
to save some room?

57:27.363 --> 57:29.699
-People eat when they're sad.
-[Blanca scoffs]

57:29.782 --> 57:31.784
This is so fucked up.

57:31.868 --> 57:34.036
That could have been any one of us.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.455
Still can be.

57:36.288 --> 57:37.414
Look.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.920
[Janae] Check it out. Check it out.
[Alison] Oh, man!

57:43.004 --> 57:44.338
[Black Cindy] I can't look.

57:47.717 --> 57:49.010
[officer 1] Open the gate.

57:57.351 --> 57:58.561
[officer 2] All right.

57:58.645 --> 57:59.896
Shit.

58:00.813 --> 58:02.690
Why bother with an ambulance,
you know?

58:02.774 --> 58:04.567
I mean, it's not like
she's gonna get well.

58:04.651 --> 58:06.528
[laughing]

58:06.611 --> 58:08.655
What the fuck did she say?

58:08.738 --> 58:10.322
[scoffs]

58:11.365 --> 58:13.117
The fuck did you say?

58:14.326 --> 58:15.995
-[gasps]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:16.078 --> 58:17.789
Y'all wanna get dirty?

58:17.872 --> 58:19.957
We can get dirty.

58:20.041 --> 58:22.544
And my friend Jihad here
will share what she's hidin' in her scarf.

58:22.627 --> 58:24.712
[breathing heavily]

58:26.964 --> 58:28.424
Another time.

58:29.509 --> 58:30.927
[indistinct muttering]

58:31.010 --> 58:34.471
Great! All we got is time!

58:36.849 --> 58:39.060
[softly] Hey, man.
It's all right, man, shh.

58:41.353 --> 58:43.105
You might need to load that thing up now.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.693
There's not that much room. [sighs]

58:46.776 --> 58:47.819
What the...

58:47.902 --> 58:49.779
[laughing]

58:49.862 --> 58:51.322
Watson, you see this shit?

58:53.365 --> 58:56.368
-That's some Raggedy Ann nap.
-[both laughing]

58:57.411 --> 59:02.124
Oh, man. It is like
<i>Backdraft</i> up in that shit. [laughing]

59:02.208 --> 59:04.460
-Atomic Fireball.
-[both cackle]

59:04.544 --> 59:08.172
Oh, man.
Yo, Little Red Riding Head.

59:09.465 --> 59:12.259
-Yo, Ariel! Ariel! [laughs]
-Oh!

59:13.052 --> 59:15.179
[Brandy] That's why this whole thing
happened in the first place.

59:15.262 --> 59:18.808
They can't control their tempers.
Did you see her, all wild-eyed?

59:18.891 --> 59:20.685
Her friend did just die.

59:20.768 --> 59:23.896
And that's the only reason I didn't knock
her big Chiclets to the back of her skull.

59:23.980 --> 59:25.022
Out of respect.

59:25.106 --> 59:27.609
We should load up.
Rocks in socks.

59:27.692 --> 59:29.777
Maybe some spray cans.
Shoot in their eyes.

59:29.861 --> 59:32.279
They're feral with emotion.
We gotta be ready!

59:32.363 --> 59:34.531
Not to mention the fucking guards!

59:34.616 --> 59:35.867
I'm gonna get started.

59:38.620 --> 59:41.247
-I've got shivs.
-Aw, fuck.

59:42.498 --> 59:45.376
-I'm so fuckin' tired!
-But better safe.

59:45.459 --> 59:48.295
[sighs] I know, I know.
[sniffles]

59:48.379 --> 59:49.922
[sighs] Shit.

59:54.510 --> 59:57.471
Oh, shit.
The white bitches are loading up.

59:57.554 --> 59:59.682
You think we should say something?

59:59.766 --> 01:00:01.558
Might be good.

01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.519
Maybe Maria will be
a little less pissed at me

01:00:03.603 --> 01:00:06.105
if I can tell her some stuff
that she don't know.

01:00:06.188 --> 01:00:08.024
I don't know.
It can't hurt.

01:00:08.107 --> 01:00:11.110
Is this supposed
to feel all tight and shit?

01:00:11.193 --> 01:00:14.405
Like, it's pulling.
I don't know if that's a good thing.

01:00:14.488 --> 01:00:16.783
No, that's good.
It means it's working.

01:00:16.866 --> 01:00:17.909
[sighs]

01:00:17.992 --> 01:00:19.994
We're gonna look so good
for when the TV cameras

01:00:20.077 --> 01:00:21.495
come to ask about the dead girl.

01:00:21.578 --> 01:00:23.205
Mmm.

01:00:23.289 --> 01:00:24.498
They're gonna wanna interview us for sure.

01:00:24.581 --> 01:00:26.751
-We gotta stand up right in the front...
-Yup.

01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.753
...lookin' all sad and shit.

01:00:28.836 --> 01:00:30.462
I can totally do that.

01:00:31.714 --> 01:00:34.884
[sighing deeply]

01:00:36.302 --> 01:00:38.763
[inhaling deeply and sobbing]

01:00:38.846 --> 01:00:40.932
[snickering]

01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:42.141
[speaking Spanish]

01:00:42.224 --> 01:00:44.601
That's so bad, that's so bad,
that's so bad.

01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:47.188
[sighs] I love the weekend.

01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:49.273
So relaxin'.

01:00:49.356 --> 01:00:52.276
When I was growing up,
we only got Sunday off...

01:00:52.359 --> 01:00:54.779
and most of that time
was spent in church.

01:00:54.862 --> 01:00:56.864
[scoffs] Kinda blew.

01:00:56.948 --> 01:01:02.203
-Lunch was good, though.
-[groans] I think I might blow.

01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:05.372
[sighs] It felt so good going down.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.376
[sighs] We should've taken it slow.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.087
There ain't gonna be more now.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:14.256
We should've toasted her.
[sighs]

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.303
To the best hooch maker!
May she rest in peace.

01:01:19.386 --> 01:01:20.637
Fuck.

01:01:21.555 --> 01:01:23.349
She was just here.

01:01:23.432 --> 01:01:26.978
In the time machine,
dancing with her lezzie yellow girlfriend.

01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:31.065
You know, I think that time machine
is bad luck.

01:01:31.148 --> 01:01:32.483
Think about it.

01:01:33.234 --> 01:01:36.738
That nutty lady went in there
and she's in Psych now.

01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:38.865
Hoochie's dead.

01:01:38.948 --> 01:01:43.577
I think the tall lezzies are still around,
but their days could be numbered.

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:45.955
[sighs]

01:01:47.123 --> 01:01:49.709
Are you thinking what I'm destroyin'?

01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:51.543
-[chuckles]
-Totally.

01:01:51.627 --> 01:01:55.006
It's our duty as citizens of Litchfield.

01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:56.673
[both laughing]

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:01.763
[Angie yelling]

01:02:03.347 --> 01:02:04.932
[Angie] Come on, wreck it!

01:02:09.561 --> 01:02:11.230
[Piper softly] You can't remember
how many there were?

01:02:11.313 --> 01:02:13.274
I told you, I think that's all of them.

01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:14.859
You think or you know?

01:02:14.942 --> 01:02:18.780
[sighs] You can't tell it's my writing.
I wrote them with my left hand.

01:02:19.655 --> 01:02:22.283
Have you never seen
a procedural television show, Al?

01:02:22.366 --> 01:02:24.827
That's... Come on.

01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:28.455
-This was crazy.
-It's the right thing.

01:02:28.539 --> 01:02:30.041
He has a family.

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:34.879
They should be able to mourn him.
Nobody should die without a name.

01:02:34.962 --> 01:02:38.632
Yeah, well, he should have thought of that
before he became a contract killer.

01:02:38.715 --> 01:02:40.802
He was also a henchman.

01:02:40.885 --> 01:02:43.012
And he worked
at a Eurotrash clothing store.

01:02:43.095 --> 01:02:45.056
Oh, okay. Well, then...

01:02:45.139 --> 01:02:50.061
Look, before he tried to kill me, he...
didn't kill me.

01:02:50.144 --> 01:02:52.563
And we spent time together.

01:02:53.522 --> 01:02:56.192
I didn't take the life of a stranger.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.447
He had a cousin who used to run guns
for an Iraqi arms dealer

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:03.324
and they were close.

01:03:03.407 --> 01:03:06.285
And we'd go out...
we'd go out drinking sometimes.

01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:08.329
Me, and Aydin and Haluk.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.000
They were big tippers
and decent dancers...

01:03:13.084 --> 01:03:15.002
and he always smelled good.

01:03:16.295 --> 01:03:19.841
Haluk's gonna have to figure this one out
on his own, Al,

01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:22.468
and hopefully blame Kubra and not you.

01:03:23.594 --> 01:03:28.432
Sweetie... you're guilty
and you're emotional,

01:03:28.515 --> 01:03:30.476
and you haven't had closure

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.979
and someone else
just died in front of you.

01:03:33.855 --> 01:03:36.648
I get it, but I can't let you do this.

01:03:36.732 --> 01:03:39.068
It's too dangerous.

01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:41.695
Okay? I'm sorry.

01:03:43.197 --> 01:03:44.406
[sighs]

01:03:45.449 --> 01:03:47.076
He was a person.

01:03:47.159 --> 01:03:48.577
I know he was.

01:03:53.624 --> 01:03:56.293
There might be two more
in the hall by the chapel.

01:03:57.669 --> 01:03:59.171
Let's go get them.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.470
[Suzanne groaning] Ooh, ow.

01:04:08.764 --> 01:04:11.225
[inhales sharply]

01:04:14.103 --> 01:04:15.354
[scoffs]

01:04:17.106 --> 01:04:18.607
[Suzanne groans softly]

01:04:20.985 --> 01:04:22.528
Everything hurts.

01:04:25.197 --> 01:04:26.282
Yep.

01:04:32.704 --> 01:04:34.331
You got guests.

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:39.711
[Josh] Oh, damn.

01:04:39.795 --> 01:04:41.797
I could have sworn
you were wearing a blue tie.

01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:43.590
-Do you have a blue tie here?
-No.

01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:46.218
Fine. Here.
Pin that on.

01:04:47.219 --> 01:04:49.013
Hey... [snapping fingers]

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:51.598
-Is that necessary?
-Well, you don't wanna be shiny.

01:04:51.682 --> 01:04:54.685
Shiny implies sweat, which implies duress,
which implies culpability.

01:04:54.768 --> 01:04:57.729
Here.
All the news outlets have this.

01:04:57.813 --> 01:04:59.148
It's gonna be part of the piece.

01:05:00.357 --> 01:05:01.858
He's dressed for Halloween.

01:05:01.943 --> 01:05:03.652
Can't know that for sure.

01:05:03.735 --> 01:05:06.697
He's wearing a bullet belt.
He's... Rambo.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.951
Knock, knock! Thought you could use
a little energy boost.

01:05:10.034 --> 01:05:11.535
No! No caffeine.

01:05:11.618 --> 01:05:14.288
He'll appear shaky and nervous.
We want him in complete control.

01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.790
Zach... let's, uh,
triple-check that the prisoners

01:05:16.873 --> 01:05:19.626
don't have access to the press
and vice versa.

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:21.503
See, this is why
I wanted a complete lockdown.

01:05:21.587 --> 01:05:24.340
In fact, you know what?
It's not too late.

01:05:24.423 --> 01:05:26.217
Get on the loudspeaker.
Get everyone back to their dorms.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.760
-Let's do that, okay?
-[Caputo] Okay, fine.

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:30.096
[Josh] Okay.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.848
What are you doing here?

01:05:33.474 --> 01:05:36.018
It's quieter here than I thought.
The prison.

01:05:36.102 --> 01:05:38.812
Yeah... someone died yesterday.

01:05:38.895 --> 01:05:42.441
I know, they're... they're saying
it'll probably make national news.

01:05:42.524 --> 01:05:45.277
MCC is so lucky to have you.

01:05:45.361 --> 01:05:48.364
You are a part of this community.
You will put everyone at ease.

01:05:48.447 --> 01:05:51.951
So, studies show that viewers
like to see paper and ink.

01:05:52.034 --> 01:05:53.327
Gives it an analog feel.

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.412
So I went ahead and wrote out
your statement for you.

01:05:55.496 --> 01:05:57.789
Eye contact is key, however,

01:05:57.873 --> 01:05:59.959
so you're gonna wanna
look up intermittently,

01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.086
and look like you're talking
from the heart.

01:06:03.587 --> 01:06:07.133
-"A low-achieving grifter"?
-[chuckles] Junior college.

01:06:07.216 --> 01:06:11.012
We're trying to paint a picture here,
and the picture has to be very clear.

01:06:11.095 --> 01:06:12.429
He was not a good man.

01:06:12.513 --> 01:06:16.225
Unlawful, immoral, and no longer to be
associated with our corporation.

01:06:17.851 --> 01:06:20.354
[sighs] You got shiny again.
Hey! Makeup?

01:06:20.437 --> 01:06:21.730
[Caputo sighs]

01:06:25.859 --> 01:06:27.153
You'll be great.

01:06:28.904 --> 01:06:32.116
I didn't notice that before.
I'll grab my concealer.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:37.288
Bite marks?
I didn't notice that before either.

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:41.542
-Where are you going?
-I gotta, uh...

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.127
I need a minute.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.464
Eight minutes to the five o'clock news!
Empty that bladder!

01:06:49.258 --> 01:06:51.218
General Washington?

01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:55.014
This is Warden Caputo
of the Litchfield Correctional Facility.

01:06:59.893 --> 01:07:01.145
No, sir.

01:07:02.313 --> 01:07:03.980
She's not okay.

01:07:07.359 --> 01:07:10.487
[Poussey] Yup... taking off in two weeks.

01:07:11.322 --> 01:07:13.782
Dutch smoke can't be
much better than this.

01:07:13.865 --> 01:07:16.993
-You pack some dank here.
-[laughs] It's not for that, man.

01:07:18.954 --> 01:07:21.290
See, I was supposed to go to West Point.

01:07:21.373 --> 01:07:23.542
I lost it over this girl.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:26.212
Damn near killed somebody.
The wrong somebody.

01:07:26.295 --> 01:07:30.382
[sighs] Got blackballed from the academy.

01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:34.261
Huh... I never told anyone that.

01:07:34.345 --> 01:07:35.804
[chuckles] It's the robe.

01:07:35.887 --> 01:07:37.556
-Inspires disclosure.
-[chuckles]

01:07:44.813 --> 01:07:46.565
Do you believe in signs?

01:07:47.566 --> 01:07:50.861
-Like lucky ducks and shit?
-Nah.

01:07:51.945 --> 01:07:53.739
What's your thing then?

01:07:53.822 --> 01:07:59.203
I believe this world's a damaged place,
and if you can find a sliver of happiness,

01:07:59.286 --> 01:08:01.205
stay in it as long as you can.

01:08:02.498 --> 01:08:04.166
-Solid monk wisdom.
-[chuckles]

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:07.836
As long as we're making confessions,
you should know...

01:08:07.919 --> 01:08:10.005
-I'm not a real monk.
-What the fuck?

01:08:11.215 --> 01:08:12.466
Sorry. [inhales]

01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:14.385
Honestly, I kinda thought
you knew already.

01:08:14.468 --> 01:08:18.555
Between the bikes and the pot...
the fact that I'm mostly Irish,

01:08:18.639 --> 01:08:20.474
and we were throwing Toffifays at people.

01:08:20.557 --> 01:08:23.352
[stutters] I thought y'all
was like some new-wave order.

01:08:24.603 --> 01:08:27.648
-What is all this then?
-Improv Everywhere.

01:08:27.731 --> 01:08:29.483
It's a religion piece.

01:08:29.566 --> 01:08:31.568
We're the monks...

01:08:31.652 --> 01:08:34.571
then there's packs of nuns
and packs of rabbis

01:08:34.654 --> 01:08:37.533
going all around the city tonight
doing scenes.

01:08:37.616 --> 01:08:40.493
-We had trouble finding imams, though.
-[chuckles]

01:08:40.577 --> 01:08:43.872
Yeah, see, for those guys,
you need to sweeten the deal, like...

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:47.000
the imams get to give out
cocktails or something.

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.084
[chuckles]

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:50.546
-Carry adorable kittens.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:08:50.629 --> 01:08:53.089
Hey, next month, we got a big dance piece.

01:08:53.174 --> 01:08:56.176
We're gonna be dancing
with live rats at a food festival.

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.970
You wanna join us?
Are you comfortable dancing with rodents?

01:08:59.054 --> 01:09:01.307
Hell, no.
They always try to lead.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.724
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

01:09:02.808 --> 01:09:04.893
-And I'm gonna be in Amsterdam!
-Mmm-hmm.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:06.728
-You know, startin' my new life.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:09:06.812 --> 01:09:08.229
-Figurin' out my shit.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:12.484
I quit my job at Dave and Busters.
Selling off my stash.

01:09:12.568 --> 01:09:14.153
Smokin' off my stash.

01:09:14.236 --> 01:09:15.612
You used to work at Dave and Busters?

01:09:15.696 --> 01:09:17.072
-Mmm-hmm.
-Damn.

01:09:17.156 --> 01:09:19.158
-Can you get me free games?
-Hell, no!

01:09:19.241 --> 01:09:21.827
Yeah, my manager, Carl,
is serious as fuck.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.871
-Man would charge you for a ice cube.
-[chuckles]

01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:26.081
[exhales heavily]

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:30.085
-To one amazing night.
-[chuckles]

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:33.129
To New York City, baby.

01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:35.591
[chuckles and imitates explosion]

01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:40.886
In five, four, three, two...

01:09:42.764 --> 01:09:44.975
As many of you are aware...

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:50.606
we suffered a terrible tragedy here at the
Litchfield Correctional Camp yesterday.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:56.987
As warden, it is my job to ensure that
this prison runs safely and effectively.

01:10:04.119 --> 01:10:06.162
Because we are a women's camp,

01:10:06.247 --> 01:10:08.790
that responsibility
is often underestimated.

01:10:08.874 --> 01:10:11.167
[whispering] Oh, shit.
He's going off-book.

01:10:11.252 --> 01:10:14.463
The assumption being
that minimum-security women

01:10:14.546 --> 01:10:17.299
do not pose a physical threat,

01:10:17.383 --> 01:10:21.595
that as long as they are clothed and fed,
the ship will run smoothly.

01:10:22.513 --> 01:10:27.183
Well... our ship ran off
its course yesterday.

01:10:28.519 --> 01:10:32.273
<i>And because of that,</i>
<i>a young woman lost her life.</i>

01:10:32.981 --> 01:10:37.068
<i>Sadly, there is nothing we can do</i>
<i>to bring her back.</i>

01:10:37.152 --> 01:10:39.863
<i>Now, I understand, in these situations,</i>

01:10:39.946 --> 01:10:43.409
<i>everybody is hungry for blood,</i>
<i>everybody is looking for a scapegoat.</i>

01:10:43.492 --> 01:10:46.662
<i>But in this case,</i>
<i>the officer responsible...</i>

01:10:46.745 --> 01:10:47.954
<i>well, he was set up to fail.</i>

01:10:48.038 --> 01:10:51.166
<i>He was a victim of circumstance.</i>

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:54.336
<i>Every day, my officers deal</i>
<i>with convicted felons.</i>

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.214
<i>Every day, they interact with women</i>
<i>who were sent here to serve their time,</i>

01:10:58.299 --> 01:11:00.509
<i>to repent for their crimes.</i>

01:11:00.592 --> 01:11:06.765
Any allegations coming from them
or any other source are just not credible.

01:11:09.184 --> 01:11:13.272
My officer fulfilled his duty,
and I defend his actions.

01:11:13.355 --> 01:11:15.190
He will take a short leave of absence,

01:11:15.274 --> 01:11:18.360
<i>and be back in uniform,</i>
<i>pending investigation.</i>

01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:21.947
<i>Thank you all. I will not</i>
<i>be answering questions at this time.</i>

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:23.699
[reporters clamoring]

01:11:26.702 --> 01:11:29.413
Man, they ain't gonna fire him!
They're letting him go free!

01:11:29.496 --> 01:11:31.540
They called him the fuckin' victim!

01:11:31.623 --> 01:11:33.249
[screams]

01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:34.960
[Taystee] Yo, they lettin' him off!

01:11:35.043 --> 01:11:37.796
They lettin' him off!
They didn't even say her name, yo!

01:11:37.879 --> 01:11:39.881
They didn't even say her name!

01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.843
[all clamoring]

01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.013
[Rikerson] Come on, pick up.
Pick up!

01:11:47.514 --> 01:11:50.225
-There's no justice! There's no justice!
-[CO] What's going on?

01:11:50.309 --> 01:11:53.437
-[all clamoring]
-They fuckin' defendin' him?

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.688
Fuck this place!

01:11:54.771 --> 01:11:57.441
We are done!
Fuck this place!

01:11:57.524 --> 01:11:59.526
[all shouting]

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:01.862
Yo, some shit's goin' down.
Come on, let's go.

01:12:02.488 --> 01:12:07.993
Hey, this mean we are gonna be on TV
or we're not gonna be on TV?

01:12:08.076 --> 01:12:10.912
-I gotta know these things.
-It means sharpen your fuckin' eye pencil!

01:12:10.996 --> 01:12:12.456
I use liquid liner.

01:12:14.416 --> 01:12:17.836
[Angie and Leanne]
Attica! Attica! Attica!

01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:19.921
You're missin' all the fun!
Come on!

01:12:20.005 --> 01:12:23.174
[laughing] What's Attica again?

01:12:24.092 --> 01:12:26.762
I don't know. [chuckles]
I heard other people sayin' it.

01:12:26.845 --> 01:12:29.014
Oh, maybe it's the dad
from that bird book?

01:12:29.097 --> 01:12:31.433
You mean <i>To Kill a Mockingjay?</i>

01:12:31.517 --> 01:12:33.727
-Yeah! <i>Hungry Games.</i>
-[exclaims]

01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:36.438
-Attica!
-Attica!

01:12:36.522 --> 01:12:40.025
[inmates chanting] Attica! Attica!

01:12:42.778 --> 01:12:44.821
