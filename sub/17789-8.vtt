Wait, that car
looks faster.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.275
Oof!

09:35.308 --> 09:37.678
[ Tires screech ]

09:37.711 --> 09:40.380
[ Doorbell rings ]

09:40.413 --> 09:41.815
Arrgh!

09:41.849 --> 09:43.684
Brydie!
What do you want?

09:43.717 --> 09:46.687
Love.
Upstairs, second on the left.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.723
Ah!
[ Grunting ]

09:49.757 --> 09:51.524
No worries.

09:51.558 --> 09:55.763
[ Pop music plays
in headphones ]

09:55.796 --> 09:57.297
Ahhhh?

09:57.330 --> 09:59.466
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

09:59.499 --> 10:00.901
What are you
doing here?!

10:00.934 --> 10:03.236
He's been chasing you since
you lovingly locked eyes

10:03.270 --> 10:05.272
at the mall, before you
disappeared into the crowd.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.140
He's been on a quest
to find you all day.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.642
He pushed babies
to the floor...

10:08.676 --> 10:10.343
He stole
your medical records...

10:10.377 --> 10:11.845
He jacked a car...

10:11.879 --> 10:13.881
And ran over your dad
when he stood between you.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.016
All in the name of love.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.286
That sounds a little like child
bullying, breach of privacy,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.354
grand theft auto,
battery, and stalking.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.791
Let me rephrase that --
that's exactly what it is!

10:23.824 --> 10:26.593
And for the record, we did not
lock eyes lovingly.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.562
Ahhhh...

10:29.596 --> 10:32.099
Ahhh...

10:32.132 --> 10:34.401
Then why did you hit him up
on Trawlr?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.303
Because the creepy guy
standing

10:36.336 --> 10:38.672
in my bedroom looks
nothing like this!

10:38.706 --> 10:41.775
[ Sighs ]

10:41.809 --> 10:44.311
Wait! Wait.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.279
After everything you've
been through to find me,

10:46.313 --> 10:47.948
I can't just let you
walk away.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.482
Ah?

10:49.516 --> 10:51.852
So...

10:55.355 --> 10:56.757
Rocky: Aw, thanks, man.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.160
It's not the same,
but it'll do for now.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.398
