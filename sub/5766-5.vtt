WEBVTT

00:01.860 --> 00:04.021
Previously on The Good Wife...
I guess you're putting in
a lot of hours with Will.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.367
WILL:
You're right.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.038
I don't have a plan.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.367
Let's just drop this.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.537
Okay?

00:09.570 --> 00:11.106
ALICIA:
He told me to drop it.

00:11.140 --> 00:14.439
Anything said in voicemail
doesn't count.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.345
Tonight I would like
to announce a new candidate

00:16.380 --> 00:17.745
for state's attorney.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.771
Wendy Scott-Carr.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.276
(applause)

00:21.320 --> 00:22.810
WENDY:
Thank you so much.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.684
I-I don't want to take up a lot
of your time. Ijust, um...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.654
I could say that
I was running

00:28.690 --> 00:31.625
because of some
grand ideals,
(dialing cell phone)

00:31.660 --> 00:34.049
but, um, it's really...

00:34.100 --> 00:36.125
It's about a fountain.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.799
I have two daughters, and

00:39.840 --> 00:41.535
there was this fountain
near the courthouse

00:41.570 --> 00:42.764
that I used to love,

00:42.810 --> 00:45.108
so I took them to see it,

00:45.140 --> 00:47.108
and, uh, it
wasn't running.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.072
Who's Wendy Scott-Carr?

00:48.110 --> 00:49.304
So, I went to maintenance...

00:49.350 --> 00:50.806
No, I know that. What else?

00:50.850 --> 00:53.774
...but they said
that the contractor

00:53.820 --> 00:55.640
had_ an exclusive deal
With an alderman,

00:55.680 --> 01:00.219
and he told me that there
were no more funds available...

01:00.260 --> 01:02.125
We need to check on
our endorsements.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.229
WENDY: ...the money
had disappeared...

01:03.260 --> 01:04.386
Who is she?

01:04.430 --> 01:06.557
Civil Action
Bureau, low level.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.125
Oh.
Her grandad was
at Selma.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.263
WENDY: How do you cut through
the layers of corruption?

01:11.300 --> 01:14.133
How do we get the
fountain working again?

01:14.170 --> 01:15.660
Thank you.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.668
(applause)

01:17.710 --> 01:18.859
The Tribune's
over there.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.105
Come on, let's do
a drop-by quote.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.668
DIANE: And now, as
dinner is served,

01:27.720 --> 01:29.881
Steppenwolf Theatre
will entertain us

01:29.920 --> 01:33.515
with scenes from their hit play,
The Cow With No Country.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.187
(murmuring)
(applause)

01:35.220 --> 01:37.222
(dramatic music plays)

01:38.790 --> 01:41.850
TAM MY:
Three-pointer.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.492
Who, Derrick Rose?

01:43.530 --> 01:45.896
Bulls up by eight.

01:45.930 --> 01:49.206
(mooing)

01:49.240 --> 01:50.264
(mooing)

01:50.310 --> 01:51.868
MAN:
Moo-Cow, come back!

01:51.910 --> 01:53.275
(mooing)

01:53.310 --> 01:55.437
You're the best moo-cow
in the whole world,

01:55.480 --> 01:57.505
and I love you.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.903
(mooing)

01:58.950 --> 02:01.748
You're not just a cow.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.384
You're my best
friend, Moo-Cow.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.682
Good stuff.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.517
(laughs)
(mooing)

02:06.560 --> 02:09.427
So how do you
know Will?

02:09.460 --> 02:11.451
My sister.
She used to date him.

02:11.490 --> 02:12.696
Really?

02:12.730 --> 02:14.220
Okay.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.522
He broke her heart.
It was devastating.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.925
We don't really
need to go there.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.767
Now we have
to go there.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.165
She took 20 aspirin.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.599
We had to get
her stomach pumped.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.165
(laughing):
She's making this up.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.872
Will came home from college
and told her it was over.

02:26.910 --> 02:29.549
He'd fallen in love
with somebody else.
Oh.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.639
BOND:
So you're here
for revenge?
Yup.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.648
My sister's avenging angel.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.375
Going to date him
and break his heart.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.546
I'll toy with him first.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.546
Make him think
his jokes are funny.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.251
My jokes aren't funny?

02:40.290 --> 02:41.917
(mooing)

02:41.960 --> 02:44.724
Please don't take Moo-Cow
to the front lines. Please!

02:44.760 --> 02:46.250
(mooing)

02:46.300 --> 02:48.222
I'll find you, Moo.
I'll end this,

02:48.260 --> 02:49.488
and I'll find you.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.259
(onstage gunfire)

02:51.300 --> 02:53.188
Sorry to interrupt.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.332
What is it?

02:54.370 --> 02:56.736
There's someone at the office
who needs to speak to you.

02:56.770 --> 02:57.907
Your phone was off.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.805
Who, a client?
No.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.206
Uh, she says she was
just sexually assaulted.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.808
Did she go to the police?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.203
Yes.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.649
They refused to prosecute.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.216
Did she have a rape
kit administered?

03:08.250 --> 03:09.342
COURTNEY:
No. It's not...

03:09.390 --> 03:11.711
It's inappropriate contact.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.480
Okay, so...

03:14.520 --> 03:17.489
take her name and number,
and I'll phone her tomorrow.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.952
Actually, I really think

03:18.990 --> 03:21.823
you want to come
talk to her now.
Why?

03:21.860 --> 03:24.397
Because of the person
she said did it.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.962
And you believe her?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.706
Enough.

03:30.740 --> 03:32.571
ACTOR:
His leg is broken.
We'll have to put him

03:32.610 --> 03:33.975
out_ of his
misery.
(Moo-Cow moans)

03:34.010 --> 03:35.409
Um, excuse me.
I'm just...

03:35.440 --> 03:36.907
I'm gonna run across
the street for a minute.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.099
Is everything all right?

03:38.150 --> 03:40.539
Oh, yes. Can you just let
Peter know I'll be right back?

03:40.580 --> 03:42.343
ACTOR:
I've been wandering
for weeks.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.585
My ears.

03:44.620 --> 03:45.848
I can't hear.

03:45.890 --> 03:46.982
(Moo-Cow moans)

03:47.020 --> 03:48.715
Where are you, Moo-Cow?

03:48.760 --> 03:50.284
Are you there?

03:50.330 --> 03:51.957
(moaning)

03:51.990 --> 03:53.958
Are you there?!

03:58.300 --> 04:00.291
Hello. Miss White, is it?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.467
Yes. Hi.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.535
Wow, it is you,
isn't it?

04:04.570 --> 04:06.003
They said
that you worked here.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.701
Yes.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.538
Um, so I've been filled
in on your... issue,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.844
and Ijust want
to make sure...

04:12.880 --> 04:15.713
Actually, could you tell me
where this assault took place?

04:15.750 --> 04:17.638
In his hotel room.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.988
Oh. You were
visiting him?

04:20.020 --> 04:21.351
Yes.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.322
Uh, no.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.827
The hotel sent me.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.350
I'm a LMT.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.493
A...?

04:26.530 --> 04:28.691
A licensed massage therapist.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.391
Ah.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.498
Uh, I was giving him
a massage.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.728
Okay, I know
that this sounds nuts.

04:38.770 --> 04:41.000
Um, I like him.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.701
I do.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.377
I mean, what he does
in Africa

04:44.410 --> 04:46.071
on account of women.

04:46.110 --> 04:50.046
And then he does... this.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.887
And you want to
bring charges?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.979
(sighs)
Yeah.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.011
I went to the police,
and they, um...

04:56.060 --> 04:58.028
(laughs)

04:58.060 --> 04:59.891
I guess I sounded nuts, so

04:59.930 --> 05:02.728
I came here...
'cause of you.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.967
What hotel was this at?

05:06.000 --> 05:06.967
The Foreland.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.662
And you happen to
remember what room number?

05:09.710 --> 05:10.904
906...

05:10.940 --> 05:13.079
Though I think
he had two rooms.

05:13.110 --> 05:16.443
Miss White, you do know that
all we can do is bring suit.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.471
We're lawyers.
We're not the police.

05:18.510 --> 05:19.772
But at least...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.118
At least
I don't feel crazy here.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.015
When did this
assault take place?

05:24.050 --> 05:26.587
I got to his room at 1:00.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.781
The session is an hour.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.755
I have the time on the bill,
if that helps.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.950
Can I see it?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.127
Yes, of course.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.525
And what happened
over here?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.994
Um, he...
Uh, he did that.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.439
Here.

05:41.470 --> 05:43.404
(laughs)

05:43.440 --> 05:45.431
$650.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.438
That's how much
a massage costs?

05:47.480 --> 05:50.142
For a VIP? Yes.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.819
And is that a big tip?

05:52.850 --> 05:55.569
Yeah. Very big.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.011
Will you excuse me
for a moment?

06:04.630 --> 06:06.029
He's not there.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.028
There's a Mr. Harbour
in room 906.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.563
Okay. Thanks.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.158
I'm kind of relieved.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.065
It was going to
be a long night.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.068
Yeah. I can deal with her.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.738
No, I got it.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.738
Okay, Miss White,

06:20.780 --> 06:23.408
thank you so much for
coming in, but, um,

06:23.450 --> 06:25.702
we don't handle...
cases like this.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.047
I'm sorry.
What happened?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.411
No. Nothing.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.111
It's just, we
have to be cautious

06:30.150 --> 06:32.141
about what kind
of cases we take.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.487
He got to you, didn't he?

06:33.520 --> 06:35.078
No, but thank you
for coming in.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.456
He's not under his own name
at the hotel.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.422
He's under an alias.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.462
Like a movie star.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.990
What name?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.463
Mr. Harbour.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.961
(lively drum solo playing)

07:06.920 --> 07:09.115
*

07:13.230 --> 07:15.221
Joe Kent?

07:15.260 --> 07:17.922
The Nobel Prize-winning
Joe Kent?

07:17.970 --> 07:20.598
Yes. He's under an assumed name
at the Foreland.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.733
I didn't even know
he was In town.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.237
ALICIA:
He's speaking
at NOW tomorrow.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.101
And the state's attorney
isn't prosecuting?

07:26.140 --> 07:28.529
That's what she says.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.002
I'm still trying
to find out why.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.699
DIANE:
I don't believe it.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.615
He is being awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize

07:33.650 --> 07:35.049
for his work with women.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.947
He's one of the most respected
Americans in the world.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.548
So, what do we do?

07:39.590 --> 07:41.057
Do you believe her?

07:41.090 --> 07:43.251
She seems...

07:43.290 --> 07:46.088
calmer than I would expect,

07:46.130 --> 07:49.520
but this tip she
got-- it's just...

07:51.530 --> 07:53.896
Okay, why don't Derrick
and I go talk to her?

07:53.940 --> 07:55.237
_Just a few
qurck questions.

07:55.270 --> 07:57.261
We'll be
right back.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.528
(drum solo continues)

08:03.810 --> 08:05.539
No. I'm-I'm fine.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.946
Lockhart, Gardner.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.982
Yes.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.181
I already said.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.654
11:00.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.988
Bye.
Do you have
someplace to go?

08:18.030 --> 08:19.258
No, uh...

08:19.290 --> 08:21.019
Well, I mean, yes, but later.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.290
Someone at the police station
phoned these creeps--

08:23.330 --> 08:24.820
uh, Carpton & Greene.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.292
Do you know them?

08:26.330 --> 08:28.537
The law firm. Yes.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.167
We take this and we're wrong--
we lose half our client list.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.609
WILL:
We take this
and we're right--

08:33.640 --> 08:34.834
then it's big.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.279
Financially big.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.079
Is she all right?

08:39.110 --> 08:40.611
Yes.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.618
Carpton & Greene phoned her.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.186
They want her if we don't.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.682
Tread lightly,
gentlemen.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.085
She's meeting them at 11:00.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.020
11:00 tomorrow?

08:51.060 --> 08:51.879
No, tonight.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.591
I'll get Kalinda.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.289
I'll get Blake.

08:54.330 --> 08:55.752
WILL:
Great.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.267
Four hours to decide

08:57.300 --> 09:00.269
if we sue the_most beloved
Democrat In America.

09:16.350 --> 09:18.147
To be honest,
I don't think of myself

09:18.190 --> 09:19.657
as the African-American
candidate

09:19.690 --> 09:21.157
or as the woman candidate.
The question IS

09:21.190 --> 09:23.624
what the Democratic Committee
will think of you.

09:23.660 --> 09:25.127
Well, my guess is,

09:25.160 --> 09:26.957
they'll think of me
as the loose cannon.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.265
I just stood up there and said
they were part of the problem.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.699
(laughter)
Hello, Eli.

09:31.730 --> 09:32.992
Mr. Jordan.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.032
Wendy, this is Mr.
Florrick's campaign manager.

09:36.070 --> 09:38.209
Yes, I know of Mr. Gold.
We've never met.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.366
(laughs)

09:39.410 --> 09:40.877
Well, Peter would love
to say hello.

09:40.910 --> 09:42.775
I'd love that, too.
After dessert?

09:42.810 --> 09:46.644
Perfect. And Peter will see you
for lunch tomorrow, Mr. Jordan.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.977
Oh, is that
this week?

09:48.020 --> 09:50.716
Yes, it's this week.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.149
Uh, my office
called to confirm.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.987
I-I'll give him a call.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.988
(light piano music playing)

09:59.660 --> 10:01.025
We've got endorsement issues.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.119
Vernon Jordan might be in play.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.321
This is the attorney-client
retainer agreement.

10:06.370 --> 10:09.703
When you sign that,
we're your lawyers,

10:09.740 --> 10:11.867
everything we
say is privileged

10:11.910 --> 10:13.400
and cannot be used in court.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.069
But up to that point-- up to
the point you sign this form--

10:17.110 --> 10:21.149
we can be subpoenaed, so,

10:21.180 --> 10:23.410
in order to protect you,
we're not going to take

10:23.450 --> 10:26.658
any notes,
okay?
Okay.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.681
(phone ringing)

10:29.930 --> 10:32.023
Hey. Where are you?

10:32.060 --> 10:34.927
I'm there. You gonna tell me
what the big secret is now?

10:34.960 --> 10:38.020
The masseuse--

10:38.070 --> 10:40.095
the one we're thinking
of representing--

10:40.140 --> 10:42.938
she said she was assaulted
by Joe Kent.

10:42.970 --> 10:45.700
The Joe Kent?
Yes.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.435
So we're trying
to make a quick deal on this,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.108
but as you can
imagine, it's sensitive.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.879
Yeah, accusing the Nobel

10:51.910 --> 10:54.845
Peace Prize winner
of sexual assault, I'd say so.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.246
We're questioning the masseuse
now, but see what you

10:57.290 --> 10:59.212
can find out
on Kent, okay?

10:59.250 --> 11:00.353
Room 906.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.278
You want anything?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.424
Anything that'll
expedite a settlement.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.121
Got it.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.834
Operator,
can I have Housekeeping?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.848
Yeah, I'm in room 906.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.848
My trashcan is pretty full.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.871
Could you send
someone up, please?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.740
(knocking)

11:31.820 --> 11:32.809
Yeah?

11:32.860 --> 11:34.111
What do you need?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.115
Nothing now.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.286
Kalinda's on it.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.151
You sure?

11:38.190 --> 11:40.021
I'm sure.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.388
DIANE:
Blake?

11:46.470 --> 11:47.732
Y
es, ma'am?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.436
I need you to look
into someone

11:55.480 --> 11:57.801
for me, if
you're free.
I am free.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.442
Laura White.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.210
What do you want to know?
If she's lying;

12:02.250 --> 12:04.787
if she's trying to make a
quick buck; if she's trying

12:04.820 --> 12:05.946
to embarrass Mr. Kent;

12:05.990 --> 12:09.118
any ties to the
Republican Party.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.923
Okay.
It needs to
happen fast.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.928
We have until 11:00.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.791
Here's my cell.

12:14.830 --> 12:16.320
Phone me and only me,

12:16.360 --> 12:17.918
whatever you get.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.835
If you're okay with that?

12:19.870 --> 12:21.462
I'm okay with that.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.832
And... if you ever

12:23.870 --> 12:25.838
need anything like this
in the future, Ms. Lockhart,

12:25.870 --> 12:26.973
don't hesitate to call.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.808
He asked me to pay
special attention

12:31.850 --> 12:33.272
to his adductor.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.548
And that's...?

12:34.580 --> 12:37.845
Uh, the inside
thigh. Here.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.812
And that is... restricted?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.487
Well, it usually means

12:41.520 --> 12:43.988
that a customer wants
Inappropriate contact.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.349
Sexual contact?

12:45.390 --> 12:46.482
Yes.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.521
And I was, like...

12:48.560 --> 12:50.164
"I don't do that,

12:50.200 --> 12:53.033
but I can massage the hamstring
and the quadriceps."

12:53.070 --> 12:56.836
Well, that made him
pretty... vexed.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.839
So I was, like,
"I can send up somebody else."

12:59.880 --> 13:01.836
And then what happened?
Well, then I went

13:01.880 --> 13:03.802
into the bathroom
to wash my hands,

13:03.850 --> 13:05.909
and that's when
I saw him behind me.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.815
In the bathroom?
Yes.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.841
And he was...

13:10.890 --> 13:13.279
You know, he had a robe,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.356
but his...

13:15.390 --> 13:17.881
his penis was exposed.

13:17.930 --> 13:18.954
He was erect?

13:18.990 --> 13:20.890
Yes.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.421
And he was like,

13:23.470 --> 13:25.961
"I paid for more."
And I went,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.959
"No, sir, Mr. Kent. You
paid for exactly that amount."

13:30.010 --> 13:32.103
So, then he was like,

13:32.140 --> 13:34.233
"Could you help me with
something in the bedroom?"

13:34.280 --> 13:36.202
His hamstring.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.946
And why didn't you
leave then?

13:37.980 --> 13:40.574
On account of,

13:40.620 --> 13:43.942
I only make money
if the hotel wants me back,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.208
so I need to keep
the VIP customers happy.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.581
From what you're saying,
it doesn't seem

13:47.620 --> 13:51.329
like there was any way
to "make Mr. Kent happy."

13:51.360 --> 13:54.557
But my table was still in the
bedroom, so I needed to get it.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.921
So he took me in there,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.892
and he was struggling
with this remote control.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.568
Um, he wanted
to know how to work it.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.239
I guess you could play video
games, and he wanted to know

14:03.270 --> 14:05.204
how to play
Hedgehog.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.504
And that's
when he threw me

14:07.540 --> 14:08.529
on the bed.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.501
He was on top of me.

14:09.540 --> 14:13.647
He was grabbing me.
He pinched my breasts,

14:13.680 --> 14:16.547
and he stuck
his finger between my legs.

14:16.580 --> 14:17.888
And you stopped him?

14:17.920 --> 14:20.081
No. After about a minute,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.918
the phone rang,
and he was...

14:22.960 --> 14:26.054
I guess it was his wife,
because he just jumped.

14:26.090 --> 14:30.527
Uh, so he grabbed this
towel and he, you know...

14:30.570 --> 14:32.060
I'm sorry.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.091
Did he do that on you or him?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.994
Him. Uh, so anyway,

14:36.040 --> 14:38.668
I just grabbed my table,
and I ran out of there.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.178
DIANE: Miss White,
don't take this

14:41.210 --> 14:44.998
the wrong way, but given that
this happened five hours ago,

14:45.050 --> 14:47.678
you seem remarkably calm.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.508
I'm not sure how I'm supposed
to take that the right way.

14:51.550 --> 14:54.257
Take it as the first of
a long line of hard questions.

14:54.290 --> 14:57.418
Would it make a difference
If I was crying?

14:57.460 --> 14:59.928
You were sexually assaulted.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.929
Wouldn't that make sense?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.621
When I was kicked
out of college,

15:05.670 --> 15:08.969
I cried for an hour,
then I stopped.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.262
And I never cried again.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.039
That's who I am.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.038
But if it helps,

15:14.080 --> 15:18.039
I wish this had happened
to somebody who cried a lot.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.401
*

15:58.220 --> 15:59.380
DIANE:
Seriously?

15:59.420 --> 16:00.717
Hedgehog?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.627
The winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize wants to play Hedgehog?

16:03.660 --> 16:05.252
It's a hotel room.
He's away from home.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.099
It's an oasis from life.
This IS a man

16:07.130 --> 16:09.496
who spent two years in Butembo
to see firsthand

16:09.530 --> 16:10.565
how women
were treated.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.692
And he likes video games.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.130
Great men like video games.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.762
You think she's lying?
I think there is a wealth

16:15.800 --> 16:19.008
of detail of her entering the
room, and the massage itself.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.337
But when she talks
about the assault,

16:20.380 --> 16:21.779
it becomes variable.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.779
The massage table is by the
door, then it's in the bedroom.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.004
She follows him
into the bedroom.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.745
It's about the hamstring.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.270
No, it's about the remote.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.244
I mean, if we take this case,
she'll get better at it,

16:32.290 --> 16:33.780
because we'll make her
better at it.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.685
We'll point out
her inconsistencies,

16:35.720 --> 16:37.688
so she'll make things
more consistent.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.029
But what we're hearing right now
is the unvarnished story.

16:41.060 --> 16:42.493
And I believe
there was a massage.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.624
But I don't believe
there was an assault.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.262
Then why would she do it?

16:47.300 --> 16:48.460
Money?
Yes.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.331
And dirty tricks.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.305
I think some people would like
to see Joe Kent brought low.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.773
Come on, Diane.
Do you know how

16:54.810 --> 16:56.334
hypocritical this is?
(phone buzzes)

16:56.380 --> 16:58.109
Last year, I-I-I didn't
believe-- what's her name,

16:58.150 --> 17:00.038
the rape victim--
for the same reason.
Yes?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.308
She kept changing her story.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.410
And you said, "Shock
does that to a woman."

17:04.450 --> 17:07.055
So which is it?

17:07.090 --> 17:08.682
That was Kalinda.
She found

17:08.720 --> 17:10.722
lipstick on
a champagne glass.

17:13.730 --> 17:14.799
You drank champagne?

17:14.830 --> 17:18.266
Uh, when I was in the bedroom,
he shoved it at me.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.359
And I thought if I just
pretended to drink,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.231
he would be fine
and let me go.

17:22.270 --> 17:23.407
Was he holding you?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.738
No, but he was
in the doorway.

17:25.770 --> 17:28.375
You know,
he was blocking it.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.298
And you said your massage
table was in the living room

17:30.350 --> 17:31.840
and the bedroom.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.075
Do you remember which
it was, actually?

17:34.120 --> 17:35.769
Uh, well, at that point, it
was probably in the bedroom.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.845
When I went to wash up,
I took it with me.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.381
So the bathroom
was adjoining the bedroom?

17:40.420 --> 17:42.217
Yes. Why?

17:42.260 --> 17:44.421
Well, when you were
discussing it before,

17:44.460 --> 17:46.849
it sounded like it was
adjoining the living room.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.552
Well, I th--

17:49.600 --> 17:52.228
Uh, yeah.
There were two bathrooms.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.430
It was a big suite.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.097
And when I went to wash up

17:55.140 --> 17:56.164
the first time...

17:56.200 --> 17:57.406
Before the massage?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.566
Right.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.101
I washed up
in the living room bathroom,

18:01.140 --> 18:02.038
but then after the massage,

18:02.080 --> 18:04.344
I washed my hands
in the bedroom bathroom.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.574
Why?

18:05.610 --> 18:07.714
Why did I use
the other bathroom?

18:07.750 --> 18:10.344
I don't know.
I did.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.851
(sighs)

18:44.390 --> 18:45.709
(clattering)

19:12.950 --> 19:14.440
DIANE: Good.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.617
Good job.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.345
She was checking
Joe Kent's web site

19:17.390 --> 19:19.517
on the exact same day
she accuses him.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.451
Okay, see what you can get
at the hotel.

19:22.490 --> 19:25.288
PETER (on phone):
I found the phone in your purse.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.298
Oh, good, I thought I lost it.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.922
If you need it, I can, uh...

19:28.960 --> 19:31.269
I can run it over to you.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.927
No, don't worry.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.939
Eli and I are, uh...

19:35.970 --> 19:37.801
are working the room.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.932
Okay.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.631
Well, good luck.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.375
Bye.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.298
Can I have
yours, too?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.669
Sure.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.648
Good metabolism, huh?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.489
No.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.817
Ten-mile run
every morning.

19:52.850 --> 19:55.410
(Balinese music playing)

19:59.960 --> 20:01.996
Some of the worst music
I've ever heard.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.361
(laughs)

20:03.400 --> 20:05.664
So...

20:05.700 --> 20:06.997
you and Will, huh?

20:07.030 --> 20:09.362
Yep, me and Will.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.436
I don't know, actually.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.301
He's got issues.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.602
Everybody's got issues.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.005
No, not him.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.746
That's what I always used
to like about him.

20:17.780 --> 20:18.849
He was fun.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.347
A real man.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.517
Now, he's gone
all gushy.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.676
Why?

20:22.720 --> 20:23.982
He's in love.

20:24.020 --> 20:24.987
With you?

20:25.020 --> 20:26.942
No, not me.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.720
Do you think people can change
who they're in love with?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.258
Sure.

20:37.430 --> 20:40.934
People fall out
of love all the time.

20:40.970 --> 20:44.861
And then, uh...

20:44.910 --> 20:47.003
then they fall in love
with somebody else.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.577
Like a change of address?

20:51.510 --> 20:53.341
She was surfing his Web site.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.712
She was checking out
"Kent For America."

20:55.750 --> 20:57.479
Yes, and she explained that.
After the massage, she

20:57.520 --> 20:59.010
went home and checked it
out; that makes sense.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.915
I think we should cut her loose.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.518
You don't believe her?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.653
I worry about how much
she needs to explain.

21:04.690 --> 21:08.023
At a certain point, credulity
has been stretched too far.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.526
Is this a mistake?

21:12.570 --> 21:14.333
It's a process, Lara.

21:14.370 --> 21:15.689
We have to go through it.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.801
Yeah, my friends will be like,

21:19.840 --> 21:22.035
"What're you doing?

21:22.080 --> 21:24.401
"He's helping women. Suck it up.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.010
I thought you were on our side."

21:27.050 --> 21:29.018
(chuckles)

21:29.050 --> 21:31.041
It would make a difference
ifI had evidence,

21:31.090 --> 21:33.581
wouldn't it?
Well, it's difficult
without it.

21:36.390 --> 21:38.858
I still have to decide
whether I want to do this.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.050
I know.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.899
No, I mean, um...

21:41.930 --> 21:44.728
I'm going to show
you something,

21:44.770 --> 21:46.897
but I still have to
decide whether I want

21:46.930 --> 21:48.932
to pursue this.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.675
The towel that he...

21:54.710 --> 21:57.372
used afterwards.

22:03.550 --> 22:05.541
That's the one.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.394
(sighs)
This is unseemly.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.091
It'd take weeks
to get DNA testing.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.563
Even if we got a match,

22:21.600 --> 22:23.568
it still doesn't
necessarily support her story.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.100
That could have come _
from an uncontrolled emissmn

22:25.140 --> 22:27.973
from the massage.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.568
We are the dregs of society.

22:29.610 --> 22:30.804
Okay, we get it, Diane.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.978
You don't think he did it.
No, that's not
getting it, Will.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.011
Believing in something
bigger than yourself...
If she was molested

22:36.050 --> 22:37.745
by Joe Kent,
then Joe Kent should pay

22:37.790 --> 22:39.985
for what...
That's not how it works.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.488
And you know it.
He pays for it either way.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.828
He's innocent, he pays for it.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.384
She's lying, he pays for it.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.648
The 24-hour news cycle
guarantees that.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.669
DERRICK:
I think it's time
we approach Mr. Kent.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.533
His_ best-case scenario--
this goes away qUIetly,

22:53.570 --> 22:55.936
so we try and
settle now.

22:55.970 --> 22:56.959
Shake him down?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.834
No, settle before a trial.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.029
It's what we
do every day.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.640
It's what you
do every day.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.602
Look, I'll go.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.948
I know Mr. Kent's lawyer
through a friend.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.788
(dialing cell phone)

23:20.030 --> 23:21.998
You have anything?

23:22.030 --> 23:24.669
She's behind on her cable, her
phone bills, her credit cards.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.792
She needs the money.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.024
Anything else?

23:27.070 --> 23:29.868
Uh, her roommate also works
as a masseuse at the Foreland.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.869
Um, the hotel staff
is suggesting

23:32.910 --> 23:36.004
that both of 'em do a bit more
than just massage,

23:36.040 --> 23:39.669
so I'm there now
and I'll find out how much more.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.814
More as in sexual release?

23:41.850 --> 23:43.886
That would be my guess.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.518
But we don't want that?

23:48.560 --> 23:52.656
Well, we want the truth,
but that's not the, uh...

23:52.690 --> 23:54.851
preferable truth.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.198
Right, and the preferable truth

23:57.230 --> 23:59.061
is that nothing happened at all?

24:02.200 --> 24:05.431
But you still want to hear
whatever I find out?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.572
Yes.

24:09.910 --> 24:13.141
It's appealing,
running together, Peter.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.647
I respected you

24:14.680 --> 24:16.045
from afar.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.082
Well, you know that
the state's attorney

24:18.120 --> 24:19.644
sets the goals
for the department,

24:19.690 --> 24:22.887
but that it's the deputy
that runs it, so...

24:22.920 --> 24:24.922
That would be quite a
step up from being...

24:24.960 --> 24:26.188
A lowly staff lawyer?

24:26.230 --> 24:27.720
(laughs)

24:27.760 --> 24:29.819
That's all right.
That's what I am.

24:29.860 --> 24:35.560
Like I tell my daughters,
I'm too big for my britches.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.239
And there's all that, um...

24:38.270 --> 24:41.501
patronage
Mr. Gold offered.

24:41.540 --> 24:46.239
I think I don't have that
many friends in Illinois.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.147
Well, in my experience,
friendship follows patronage.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.019
The thing is...

24:53.050 --> 24:54.586
Peter, I can't.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.281
My whole reason
for running

24:56.320 --> 24:58.686
is to stop
this legacy control

24:58.730 --> 25:00.254
of the state's
attorney's office.

25:00.290 --> 25:03.225
And that's no
reflection on you, Peter.

25:03.260 --> 25:07.219
I just want to be able to look
my daughters in the face.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.693
'Cause it's all about
the fountain, right?

25:13.110 --> 25:15.078
It was so nice meeting you.

25:15.110 --> 25:18.204
And it'll be fun
doing battle.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.239
Can't wait.

25:25.590 --> 25:29.082
You know the one thing I hate
more than a backroom deal, Eli,

25:29.120 --> 25:31.554
is a failed
backroom deal.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.059
(cell phone vibrates)

25:54.650 --> 25:56.971
Of course, we'd love
for this to go away.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.180
The last thing
we want to do

25:58.220 --> 26:01.280
is accuse your client on the eve
of his Nobel Prize speech.

26:01.320 --> 26:05.279
We haven't tested the towel
yet for pre-seminal fIUId,

26:05.330 --> 26:07.798
so this is a very good
moment to settle this.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.821
Settle what?

26:09.860 --> 26:12.294
Our suit.

26:12.330 --> 26:13.797
So, what do you think?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.796
What do I think?

26:15.840 --> 26:18.206
I think we can
settle this.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.128
Right now.
Just pull down your pants

26:20.170 --> 26:21.239
and touch your toes.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.269
(chuckles)

26:22.310 --> 26:23.800
Don't make us
take this public.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.148
Why not? Hey, let's take
it public together.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.818
Right now. The Tribune's
around the corner.

26:27.850 --> 26:30.148
Here's my card.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.317
Phone us by 11:00.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.659
What you have,
Mr. Gardner,

26:33.690 --> 26:35.009
is a little bitch.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.927
A little cheerleading
bitch who's tired

26:37.960 --> 26:39.928
of turning tricks
under the bleachers,

26:39.960 --> 26:41.894
and wants
to accuse Joe Kent.

26:41.930 --> 26:44.364
Joe Kent. Say the words
to yourself.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.288
Who comes out
of that fight?

26:46.330 --> 26:47.991
This is legal
malpractice, buddy.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.838
Go to hell, you stupid
son of a bitch.

26:50.870 --> 26:54.033
You two-bit
shakedown leg-breaker.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.877
You come to me
with this scam--

26:55.910 --> 26:58.777
this "two encyclopedias
for one" scam--

26:58.810 --> 27:00.346
and you expect
me to, what?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.268
Roll over? This isn't BP.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.117
Joe Kent is a great man.

27:04.150 --> 27:06.209
I'm a bastard.
That's why he hired me.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.912
You don't deal with him.
You deal with me.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.329
You come to the back door,
you stupid, number-running...

27:14.330 --> 27:15.820
(grunts)

27:21.070 --> 27:22.059
(groans)

27:22.970 --> 27:26.007
(both grunting)

27:26.040 --> 27:28.179
(shouts)

27:33.920 --> 27:35.808
You can take that as a "no."

27:45.290 --> 27:46.826
Really?

27:46.860 --> 27:49.727
Remind me to never
get you angry.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.069
So we get Lara
to sign the retainer,

27:52.100 --> 27:53.328
and we go to the press.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.361
You think he was bluffing?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.334
I don't think it matters.
We have to move forward.

27:57.370 --> 27:59.065
Why?

27:59.110 --> 28:00.975
His methods aside,
he's not wrong.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.329
We go to the press,

28:02.380 --> 28:04.143
we're suddenly the
ambulance-chasers of the Loop.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.045
You're thinking
about backing off?

28:06.080 --> 28:08.412
I'm thinking something
doesn't feel right here.

28:08.450 --> 28:09.872
He's not showing fear.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.218
DERRICK:
It's a tactic.
WILL:
Or it's real.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.310
We jump and we're wrong,
we make ourselves the story.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.157
How's that for a pretty picture?

28:17.190 --> 28:20.421
Diane and I are finally
on the same side of something.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.792
Alicia...

28:22.830 --> 28:25.424
Have Kalinda check into
other hotels where Kent stayed.

28:25.470 --> 28:29.258
If he did it once, he
did it other times.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.460
Okay, I'll say "black,"

28:30.500 --> 28:32.809
so you can say
"white," okay?

28:32.840 --> 28:35.070
I want to know the truth.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.101
Good.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.448
Good. We have two more hours.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.471
Let's use them.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.282
(soft jazz playing)

28:44.320 --> 28:46.083
He wants to endorse Peter?

28:46.120 --> 28:49.908
Yes. I know, Mr. Kent hasn't
endorsed anyone in years,

28:49.960 --> 28:51.757
but he likes Peter's
personal story.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.155
He wants_
to endorse him.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.919
When can we announce?

28:54.960 --> 28:57.793
Well, he has to travel
to Stockholm later this week,

28:57.830 --> 28:59.263
but maybe next week.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.461
Great. Peter
will be...

29:01.500 --> 29:02.831
He loves Mr. Kent.

29:02.870 --> 29:05.361
Oh, so there's
one more thing.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.208
Mr. Kent has
a thorn in his side.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.229
Okay?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.875
I know your law firm is
Lockhart, Gardner & Bond.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.071
And Mr. Florrick's wife's
a key player there?

29:15.120 --> 29:17.372
Well, she's a
second-year associate.

29:17.420 --> 29:21.049
Yeah, but the word is Lockhart,
Gardner is Peter's firm.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.910
We need them
to back off a case.

29:26.290 --> 29:27.518
WOMAN:
Is this too hard?

29:27.560 --> 29:31.428
No. No, it's fine.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.860
Last time I was here,
I had, uh, Lara.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.299
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.932
You know her?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.530
I, uh...

29:40.570 --> 29:43.869
tipped her a bit extra
last time for...

29:43.910 --> 29:45.309
a bit extra.

29:47.450 --> 29:50.044
Is something wrong?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.412
This is a VIP treatment, sir.

29:52.450 --> 29:54.589
The hotel frowns upon...

29:54.620 --> 29:56.383
"something extra."

29:56.420 --> 29:58.081
And Lara?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.427
Well, Lara goes her own way.

29:59.460 --> 30:00.996
I mean, she shouldn't do it,

30:01.030 --> 30:04.488
but I could give
her your number.

30:04.530 --> 30:07.465
Sometimes Lara does full-body
massages outside of work.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.435
LARA:
She's jealous.

30:10.470 --> 30:12.108
That's why she said it.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.402
But she's your roommate.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.568
Yes, but she's
a LMT, too.

30:16.610 --> 30:19.147
And there's only so many
of these VIP jobs.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.978
They... they pay a lot.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.284
And everybody's fighting
for whatever they can get.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.947
Sabrina, too.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.139
ALICIA:
But she was saying it

30:27.190 --> 30:29.488
to a customer who wanted
a sexual massage.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.159
Yeah?
So it seems
she was saying

30:32.190 --> 30:34.124
something good about you,

30:34.160 --> 30:35.422
something the customer
wanted to hear.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.620
No, no, no.
You don't get it.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.959
LMTs call them
"one-handed masseuses."

30:40.000 --> 30:42.434
It hurts their reputations
in the big hotels,

30:42.470 --> 30:44.358
and that's where the money is.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.469
If I'm known
for sexual massages,

30:46.510 --> 30:48.034
I won't get the big jobs.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.514
(light piano jazz playing)

31:05.260 --> 31:06.454
(phone beeps)

31:08.400 --> 31:10.550
WILL (on recording): Hey, I just
wanted to say...

31:10.600 --> 31:12.591
Look, you're right.
I don't have a plan.

31:12.630 --> 31:14.598
Okay, uh,
this is strange.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.359
I don't even know where
this came from, but...

31:17.400 --> 31:19.129
You ready?

31:19.170 --> 31:21.536
Joe Kent wants
to endorse you.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.036
Joe Kent?

31:23.080 --> 31:24.399
Yeah.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.599
The Joe Kent?

31:25.650 --> 31:27.606
Yes. His lavwer
just came up to me.

31:27.650 --> 31:29.049
What's the catch?

31:29.080 --> 31:30.308
The catch?
There is no catch.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.612
The catch is
you say "thank you."

31:31.650 --> 31:34.210
Eli?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.080
Look, nothing that will sully
you. They just want me

31:36.120 --> 31:38.054
to talk to my law firm
about them dropping a suit.

31:38.090 --> 31:40.320
I'm working on it.
Don't worry.
What's the suit?

31:40.360 --> 31:41.497
It's just a nuisance
suit against Kent.

31:41.530 --> 31:42.656
A sexual harassment suit.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.895
Don't worry.

31:47.670 --> 31:50.161
Okay. Let's talk to him.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.565
Who, Kent?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.168
No, his lawyer.

31:53.210 --> 31:56.031
This time, I want to be sure
about the backroom deal.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.542
They're investigating me,
aren't they?

32:01.580 --> 32:04.048
Yes, I think so.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.240
So this is the
way it'll be

32:06.290 --> 32:08.417
if I go through
with this?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.553
Reporters will be
looking at me, not him?

32:10.590 --> 32:13.229
Yes, probably.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.421
Why?
Because they think
they know him,

32:15.460 --> 32:16.529
and they don't know you.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.994
Yeah.

32:19.030 --> 32:21.669
That's what he said at
the state's attorney office.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.065
VVho?

32:23.100 --> 32:24.533
The guy who sent me to you.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.162
Cary.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.700
Cary Agos?

32:28.880 --> 32:31.542
He was the one who questioned me
and gave me your card.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.445
He said you'd be sympathetic.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.554
*

32:44.590 --> 32:46.228
ELI:
Peter.

32:46.260 --> 32:48.251
Peter.

32:49.430 --> 32:50.692
Hello,
Mr. Florrick.

32:50.730 --> 32:52.061
Wilk Hobson.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.035
I'm glad you're
open to this.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.731
I'm sure I don't
need to tell you,

32:56.770 --> 32:58.738
an endorsement
from Mr. Kent,

32:58.770 --> 33:01.671
especially on the heels
of his trip to Stockholm,

33:01.710 --> 33:02.779
would be massive.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.574
So all I have to do is
get my wife to drop her case?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.714
(Eli clears throat)

33:12.190 --> 33:14.488
Yeah, that's the deal.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.351
This _sexual assault
is bogus.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.755
You'd be doing
everybody a favor.

33:17.790 --> 33:20.350
And when the plaintiff goes
to another firm?

33:20.390 --> 33:24.190
She has an 11:00 pm. meeting
with Carpton & Greene.

33:24.230 --> 33:25.458
It's a firm in the family.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.422
I have an agreement
with them to bury it.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.667
You know what?

33:30.700 --> 33:33.066
It was nice talking to you.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.237
What can I tell Mr. Kent?

33:35.280 --> 33:39.398
You can tell him that I hope
my wife rips him apart,

33:39.450 --> 33:41.475
and I think she will,
'cause she's a good lawyer.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.512
Either way I know she'll do
the right thing, but it was

33:44.550 --> 33:46.643
very nice meeting you.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.681
ELI:
Let's discuss this.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.521
(laughter)

33:57.560 --> 34:00.063
Now, I know he's got
another bail hearing

34:00.100 --> 34:02.830
in an hour, so I ask
for a review of the plea.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.235
That's very funny.
Okay?

34:04.270 --> 34:06.602
Hold on, this is going
to be great.
All right.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.800
Well, hello.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.274
Cary, you sent us a
client, didn't you?

34:10.310 --> 34:12.642
I did.

34:12.680 --> 34:14.113
DERRICK:
Derrick Bond.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.744
Oh, that's right,
you guys have been going

34:16.780 --> 34:18.509
through some mergers
over there.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.778
Cary Agos.

34:19.820 --> 34:21.788
I seem to have just
missed your time with us.

34:21.820 --> 34:24.084
WILL:
So what's up
with Lara White?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.085
What's up?

34:25.130 --> 34:26.483
She said
she was assaulted.

34:26.530 --> 34:27.827
And yet state's attorney
booted the case,

34:27.860 --> 34:29.498
and you sent her
right to us.

34:29.530 --> 34:31.327
Right, I suggested
she pursue

34:31.370 --> 34:33.099
a civil path.
Why?

34:33.130 --> 34:35.792
Because I think Lara
was assaulted by Joe Kent,

34:35.840 --> 34:38.809
and I think Mr. Childs made
a mistake booting the case

34:38.840 --> 34:41.274
and I think
I wanted justice done.

34:41.310 --> 34:44.609
And you're just going
to help us out?

34:44.650 --> 34:46.345
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

34:46.380 --> 34:47.347
What makes
you think

34:47.380 --> 34:49.177
Mr. Kent did it?

34:49.220 --> 34:50.471
History.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.509
Get Kalinda on it.
DERRICK:
She is.

34:51.550 --> 34:55.384
CARY:
Good, get her to look up
previous assaults.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.684
DERRICK:
And what might she find?
Meredith Bordinay.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.278
Take the case.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.491
It's a good one.

35:01.530 --> 35:02.656
What do you think?

35:02.700 --> 35:06.227
I think he still wants
to hurt us.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.567
I'll catch up.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.867
(gentle pop music plays)

35:12.910 --> 35:14.798
(murmurs):
I'm very sorry...

35:16.410 --> 35:19.868
* There was only you and me

35:19.910 --> 35:22.242
* We were young
and wild and free... *

35:22.280 --> 35:24.840
What happened to you?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.882
I got in a
fistfight.

35:27.920 --> 35:28.852
That's a turn-on.

35:28.890 --> 35:31.586
I know, that's why I did it.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.921
I like you, Will.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.224
I don't like you
when you're serious.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.569
I know.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.397
You got a little...

35:41.440 --> 35:43.658
Yea_h.
Wait.

35:43.700 --> 35:47.568
* When you're lyin'
here in my arms *

35:47.610 --> 35:52.502
* I'm ﬁndin' it hard to believe
we're in Heaven... *

35:52.550 --> 35:54.347
(sighs)

35:54.380 --> 35:57.417
* Love is all that I need

35:57.450 --> 36:00.419
* And I found it
there in your heart... *

36:00.450 --> 36:02.281
I'll stay with you
as long as it's fun.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.287
(snickers)

36:03.320 --> 36:05.220
As soon as you fall
in love with me, it's over.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.251
Okay?
Okay.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.894
You can do
that again.

36:11.930 --> 36:16.492
* Through
the good times and the bad *

36:16.540 --> 36:18.929
* I'll be standing there
by you... *
(phone blips)

36:20.870 --> 36:21.871
Peter.

36:21.910 --> 36:23.878
Peter.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.707
Excuse me.
All right.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.900
He did it.

36:27.950 --> 36:29.440
I don't believe it.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.448
He sent me an e-mail;
he endorsed you.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.219
VVho?
Kent

36:33.250 --> 36:35.753
He must have overruled
his lawyer or something,

36:35.790 --> 36:36.711
but he endorsed you.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.988
Do you know what a
Kent endorsement means?

36:38.020 --> 36:39.089
It means women.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.849
It means African-American
women, Cauca5ian women.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.253
In one fell swoop,
it takes care

36:43.300 --> 36:44.767
of the Amber
Madison problem.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.267
Oh, God.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.324
What?

36:49.440 --> 36:52.898
He's tying himself to us.

36:52.940 --> 36:56.535
Kent-- he's tying
our fates together.

36:56.580 --> 36:59.003
Right now I'm being endorsed
by a secular saint,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.608
but if the suit goes through,

37:00.650 --> 37:02.971
I'm being endorsed
by a sexual deviant.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.841
Right, right.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.552
He's forcing you
to call Alicia off.

37:08.590 --> 37:10.558
KALINDA: _
Kent was speaking

37:10.590 --> 37:11.818
at UC Santa Cruz.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.294
He stayed at the
Scotts Valley Lodge.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.958
He requested
a VIP massage

37:17.000 --> 37:19.969
and apparently asked
the masseuse,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.968
a Meredith Bordinay,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.729
for some sexual contact.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.738
And you trust
this information?

37:25.770 --> 37:27.931
I spoke to the
masseuse herself.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.676
She had complained
to management,

37:29.710 --> 37:31.940
but when they didn't do anything
about it, she dropped it.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.948
The statute of limitations
have Since passed

37:33.980 --> 37:35.743
so can't bring suit.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.316
Will she testify?

37:37.350 --> 37:39.989
She's fragile,
but I'm working on it.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.510
What's going on?

37:41.560 --> 37:43.016
There's another
masseuse.

37:44.390 --> 37:45.857
The same thing.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.699
Bummer.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.322
ALICIA:
I'll go talk to Lara.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.692
Nqum

37:54.000 --> 37:55.490
Ms. Lockhart,
there's a call for you.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.598
Ask ifI can call back.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.868
No, it's
Ms. Kent.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.401
Joe Kent's wife.

38:08.050 --> 38:09.278
(phone ringing)

38:13.990 --> 38:15.958
Hello, Mrs. Kent?

38:15.990 --> 38:17.457
Yes, is this Diane?

38:17.490 --> 38:18.650
It is.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.954
I... is everything
all right?

38:20.990 --> 38:21.957
I don't know.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.991
I wanted to talk to you

38:24.030 --> 38:26.919
about this suit
you're thinking of bringing.

38:26.970 --> 38:27.959
Okay.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.662
I want to ask you to not.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.831
Mrs. Kent, I'm sorry, but this--

38:34.880 --> 38:36.973
it's a bit unorthodox.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.843
I just wanted to mention
Joe's work in the Congo,

38:39.880 --> 38:41.677
how important it is.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.019
Do you know about it, Diane?

38:45.050 --> 38:46.347
I do.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.085
I hope you do, Diane.

38:48.120 --> 38:52.022
Good work requires money,
and this isn't just good work.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.982
This is essential work.

38:54.030 --> 38:57.852
Women are dying there,
thousands of women.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.960
This is not just a wife pleading
for her husband, Diane.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.537
Joe can survive
the embarrassment.

39:03.570 --> 39:07.028
This suit will destroy
our efforts in Africa.

39:08.840 --> 39:12.401
Mrs. Kent, I'm sorry,
I respect you mightily,

39:12.450 --> 39:15.749
I respect your husband,
but I can't let this sway me.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.919
Why not?

39:17.950 --> 39:22.114
This woman--
what is she, who is she?

39:24.930 --> 39:27.125
Did your husband do it, ma'am?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.791
Mrs. Kent?

39:33.100 --> 39:35.489
My husband moves people.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.566
My husband has made his life
this cause.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.067
Does it matter?
Does it matter if he did it?

39:41.110 --> 39:42.509
Doesn't it matter to you?

39:42.540 --> 39:46.146
No. I can say that
with a clear conscience.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.045
The world needs my husband.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.846
It doesn't matter to me.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.846
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.050
Diane, don't do this.

39:55.090 --> 39:56.910
Please, it's wrong.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.121
Good-bye.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.562
I'll be right back.

40:14.070 --> 40:16.038
That good, huh?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.674
The goal is not to have heroes.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.143
Really?

40:20.180 --> 40:24.071
I thought the goal was to
die with the most money.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.439
ALICIA:
It's almost 11:00.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.640
Where are we?

40:27.690 --> 40:30.659
Diane doesn't have
heroes anymore,

40:30.690 --> 40:32.624
and the firm is going
to be trounced tomorrow

40:32.660 --> 40:34.799
for dragging a saint
into the gutter.

40:34.830 --> 40:37.151
You can tell Lara
we're taking her case.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.020
ALICIA:
Good.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.822
Thanks.

40:49.610 --> 40:52.044
(elevator bell dings)

41:06.760 --> 41:08.079
So... Carpton & Greene?

41:08.130 --> 41:09.995
No, heading home.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.594
We_ tried to_do too much
in one night, Lara.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.995
Get some sleep, then give me
a call in the morning.

41:17.040 --> 41:21.158
Uh, no, I'm done.

41:23.180 --> 41:26.479
We found another
masseuse he molested.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.676
She didn't bring charges?

41:29.720 --> 41:31.142
No, same thing
happened to her.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.115
She was giving him a massage,
and he attacked her.

41:34.150 --> 41:36.983
Why didn't she
bring charges?

41:37.020 --> 41:38.954
She was afraid.

41:39.990 --> 41:43.118
And four years later
this happens to you.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.128
We've only been looking
into this a few hours,

41:45.170 --> 41:49.891
so there could be
more women.

41:51.140 --> 41:55.133
Then they need to do
this, because I can't.

41:58.210 --> 42:01.179
Lara, please just
call me tomorrow.

42:01.210 --> 42:03.519
(sighs)

42:05.290 --> 42:07.315
Everything you
went through--

42:07.350 --> 42:11.309
all the press, all the
people talking about you--

42:11.360 --> 42:13.555
was it hard?

42:14.730 --> 42:16.698
Yes.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.288
And it goes on?

42:19.370 --> 42:21.736
Yes.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.265
They'll look into me--

42:25.310 --> 42:29.076
the reporters
and everyone-- and...

42:29.110 --> 42:31.328
they'll find stuff

42:31.380 --> 42:33.871
because there is stuff.

42:33.910 --> 42:37.778
My parents, my sister.

42:39.090 --> 42:42.651
People really don't want
to believe this about him.

42:42.690 --> 42:47.127
I don't want to believe this
about him, so...

42:47.160 --> 42:49.151
I just won't.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.191
Thanks.
