01:03.523 --> 01:04.523
Good evening,

01:05.424 --> 01:07.350
and welcome to movie corner.

01:07.392 --> 01:09.252
The Halloween special.

01:09.294 --> 01:10.788
I'm cort tomlinson,

01:10.830 --> 01:13.891
and we've got a whopper of a
spook show for you tonight,

01:13.933 --> 01:15.526
but that's not how
it's pronounced.

01:15.568 --> 01:17.994
I'm talking about
the cult classic

01:18.036 --> 01:19.697
in the horror movie genre,

01:19.739 --> 01:24.334
and holy quasimodo, does
it have a back story.

01:24.376 --> 01:29.381
1975, glassgirl magazine
puts out an article

01:30.817 --> 01:34.144
about a young Pennsylvania
mother named Dorothy schepp.

01:34.186 --> 01:37.448
In this piece, she claims
that her and her four children

01:37.490 --> 01:40.718
are being tormented by
something meemaw would call.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.453
"The heebie-geebies."

01:42.495 --> 01:46.156
We're talking spooky
sounds, paranoia,

01:46.198 --> 01:48.124
things being in a way
they ought not be.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.963
And so this terrifying story
goes out into the world,

01:52.005 --> 01:54.130
and who of all people reads it,

01:54.172 --> 01:58.669
but the wife of film
producer Daniel gerby.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.304
Gerby ends up buying
Dorothy's story

02:01.346 --> 02:03.273
for a mere $17,000.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.208
I have more than
that in late fees

02:05.250 --> 02:06.978
at movie gallery right now.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.311
The film starts rolling.

02:08.353 --> 02:10.748
They hire director
George l. Schmidt,

02:10.790 --> 02:12.617
who's credited with the decision

02:12.659 --> 02:16.052
to shoot the film in the
actually schepp family home.

02:16.094 --> 02:19.222
Right where all the terrorizing
took place to begin with.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.826
Fast forward, 1979.

02:21.868 --> 02:24.361
The film premieres to
disappointing reviews,

02:24.403 --> 02:26.430
and is a box office bomb.

02:26.472 --> 02:30.100
But, things turned around
in the video rental market,

02:30.142 --> 02:33.136
as it became a cult classic.

02:33.178 --> 02:34.739
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:34.781 --> 02:37.115
starring Wanda best
and Duncan lund,

02:38.116 --> 02:43.022
it's-

03:39.846 --> 03:41.114
Look at that.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.308
Franky, watch your brothers.

05:07.633 --> 05:11.095
Even the mold in this
hotel ain't safe from ya.

05:11.137 --> 05:12.897
What are you doing?

05:12.939 --> 05:15.533
Was just trying
to get a feel for the place.

05:15.575 --> 05:17.435
It is something, isn't it?

05:17.477 --> 05:18.502
What, the cellar?

05:18.544 --> 05:20.336
Well, the whole thing.

05:20.378 --> 05:21.906
Needs a little work.

05:21.948 --> 05:24.542
Haul this crud out, first thing.

05:24.584 --> 05:26.811
Oh, I kinda like it.

05:26.853 --> 05:29.046
It gives me the creeps.

05:29.088 --> 05:31.148
But, school's a
stone's throw away,

05:31.190 --> 05:33.659
and store's not much further.

05:36.996 --> 05:38.589
How are my odds?

05:38.631 --> 05:40.223
Well, if they were any worse,

05:40.265 --> 05:41.701
I'd probably still be kareck.

06:13.099 --> 06:14.257
Welcome home, Pete.

06:14.299 --> 06:15.299
Clint, is that you?

06:16.102 --> 06:17.528
- You look good.
- Thanks.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.497
17 pounds since August.

06:19.539 --> 06:21.132
Took your advice on the paleo.

06:21.174 --> 06:22.767
Right on, right on.

06:22.809 --> 06:24.001
What are you doing, Pete?

06:24.043 --> 06:25.469
Whole thing's a disaster.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.538
Had to crosscheck the
wiring by the south wall.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.773
Set me back a little,

06:28.815 --> 06:30.273
but we should be
in the green now.

06:30.315 --> 06:32.676
Sure you want to blow
up your mom's house?

06:32.718 --> 06:34.545
Maybe we should talk about this.

06:34.587 --> 06:35.780
Teri's here.

06:35.822 --> 06:37.398
Love to talk, Clint,
but there's no time.

06:37.422 --> 06:38.649
Got an early flight.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.818
Don't suppose you ran
it by the fire marshal.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.795
Does he have a chem e doctorate?

06:44.697 --> 06:46.957
Pete! Let's go in the house.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.225
Hey, ter.

06:48.267 --> 06:49.226
Wow, I didn't think
you two were still-

06:49.268 --> 06:50.427
- we're not.

06:50.469 --> 06:52.263
I brought Clint
here to arrest you.

06:52.305 --> 06:54.297
Oh, I didn't realize
he had the authority.

06:54.339 --> 06:56.000
It's a citizen's arrest.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.282
I know it's none of my business,

06:57.310 --> 07:00.471
but I always thought you
two were good together.

07:00.513 --> 07:02.439
Remember your engagement
party by the lake.

07:02.481 --> 07:03.674
Aside from arson,

07:03.716 --> 07:05.326
this is a crime against
your mother's memory.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.377
Wow, where were you
for the eulogy, Clint?

07:07.419 --> 07:08.779
Cut the crap, Pete.

07:08.821 --> 07:10.080
What a weekend.

07:10.122 --> 07:12.382
Tequila volleyball, jet skis.

07:12.424 --> 07:14.317
What was the name of that song

07:14.359 --> 07:15.719
you two were
singing all weekend?

07:15.761 --> 07:16.954
Was it cyndi lauper?

07:16.996 --> 07:18.339
Think about what
your brothers would say

07:18.363 --> 07:19.790
if they found out about this.

07:19.832 --> 07:20.925
Pat benatar.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.860
"Like a prayer."

07:22.902 --> 07:24.061
Oh yeah.

07:24.103 --> 07:25.581
Can you believe
that was 15 years ago?

07:25.605 --> 07:28.599
Since then, the lake
house has been bulldozed,

07:28.641 --> 07:29.934
you two got divorced,

07:29.976 --> 07:31.936
but we'll always
have the memory.

07:31.978 --> 07:33.604
Isn't that what matters?

07:33.646 --> 07:36.473
I don't want to sell the house
any more than you do, Pete.

07:36.515 --> 07:38.818
But this? This is crazy!

07:40.418 --> 07:42.980
I've got a half pound of c4
by the central foundations,

07:43.022 --> 07:44.915
and then another
by the south wall,

07:44.957 --> 07:46.283
and another by the north.

07:46.325 --> 07:47.818
It'll be like the
fourth of July.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.328
I got sandbags to protect us.

07:52.098 --> 07:53.524
I'll get more sandbags.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.426
Well what are you gonna
do about your nephew?

07:55.468 --> 07:57.194
- Vincent?
- He's living here.

07:57.236 --> 07:58.796
Been here for weeks.

07:58.838 --> 08:00.464
- Why?
- I don't know, Pete!

08:00.506 --> 08:02.233
Why don't you go talk to him?

08:02.275 --> 08:04.168
Or are you just gonna
blow him up, too?

08:04.210 --> 08:06.070
Theo can take care of it.

08:06.112 --> 08:07.713
Is that supposed to be a joke?

09:41.707 --> 09:44.068
Grief works in funny ways.

09:44.110 --> 09:45.311
I see his point, though.

09:46.178 --> 09:48.205
It's the honorable thing to do.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.873
Blowing her into smithereens.

09:49.915 --> 09:50.941
Noted.

09:50.983 --> 09:52.142
Thanks for the lift.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.184
You are welcome.

09:55.721 --> 09:58.450
Maybe I should stay until
this thing diffuses itself.

09:58.492 --> 09:59.516
I got this.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.985
Take it easy on him, ter.

10:01.027 --> 10:02.653
Been through a lot, all of you.

10:02.695 --> 10:04.121
Last thing Dorothy would want

10:04.163 --> 10:05.475
is to have you fighting
with each other.

10:05.499 --> 10:07.157
Happy trails, Clint.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.472
What are you doing?

10:20.514 --> 10:21.271
I don't have time for this.

10:21.313 --> 10:22.407
The kid's a space cadet.

10:22.449 --> 10:23.307
Don't tell me you're calling-

10:23.349 --> 10:24.308
- yeah I am.

10:24.350 --> 10:25.542
Pete!

10:25.584 --> 10:27.177
For all that is
holy, do not call-

10:27.219 --> 10:29.880
- I told him what I
tell all my customers.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.515
I said, I mean, sure,

10:31.557 --> 10:32.701
there's all sorts of variety.

10:32.725 --> 10:35.352
There's spring, there's
foam, there's gel,

10:35.394 --> 10:36.820
there's the hybrids.

10:36.862 --> 10:39.156
And yeah, a waterbed
might be a little heavier,

10:39.198 --> 10:40.591
maybe not as stylish,

10:40.633 --> 10:42.760
but a mattress is
probably is as important

10:42.802 --> 10:44.828
as a mortgage or a car payment.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.730
You gotta be able to
trust your mattress

10:46.772 --> 10:48.332
the way you trust your wife.

10:48.374 --> 10:50.901
He comes home from work,
stretches himself out

10:50.943 --> 10:52.903
on a heated schepp waterbed,

10:52.945 --> 10:55.339
and he knows he's
made the right choice.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.775
And then I say, "it's
like my dad used to say.

10:57.817 --> 11:00.544
Anybody can get a good
night's sleep anywhere,

11:00.586 --> 11:02.813
as long as they've got
a clean conscience."

11:02.855 --> 11:05.883
But in this day in age,
who's got one of those?

11:05.925 --> 11:08.685
That's where your schepp
waterbed will come in.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.087
So did he buy?

11:10.129 --> 11:11.021
No, not yet.

11:11.063 --> 11:12.207
He said he wanted to look online

11:12.231 --> 11:14.291
at some of these
NASA space beds.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.359
But he'll be back.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.727
You ever try memory foam?

11:16.769 --> 11:18.204
Who am I, Kurt cobain?

11:19.105 --> 11:20.498
Only asking.

11:20.540 --> 11:23.100
Nothing but premium schepp
waterbeds in my house.

11:23.142 --> 11:24.802
You in the market?

11:24.844 --> 11:28.672
I'm happy with a waterless
situation at the moment.

11:28.714 --> 11:30.025
Well then what are
you still doing here?

11:30.049 --> 11:31.827
I figured you'd be the
first one at the airport

11:31.851 --> 11:33.377
after the funeral.

11:33.419 --> 11:35.413
Just wanted to give the
house one final goodbye.

11:35.455 --> 11:38.015
He's helping franky and
I get this place settled.

11:38.057 --> 11:40.017
It's a lot of work
for two people.

11:40.059 --> 11:41.453
A lot.

11:41.495 --> 11:42.420
A lot.

11:42.462 --> 11:43.555
You want to help, Theo?

11:43.597 --> 11:44.888
I gotta be at the shop.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.491
I mean, now that
franky's retired.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.192
You know, the
business dad started.

11:48.234 --> 11:51.061
All I meant was there's
nothing around here

11:51.103 --> 11:54.231
you think you can take with you?

11:54.273 --> 11:55.866
While we're on the subject,

11:55.908 --> 11:58.268
who took senior's arm
chair out of the den?

11:58.310 --> 12:00.037
- Beats me.
- Come on.

12:00.079 --> 12:01.823
I know one of you has
been swiping dad's stuff.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.273
Like I don't have enough

12:03.315 --> 12:04.842
of senior's old junk already.

12:04.884 --> 12:07.010
So Vincent, have you
decided on your major yet?

12:07.052 --> 12:08.879
Oh, don't get me started.

12:08.921 --> 12:10.747
Don't get him started.

12:10.789 --> 12:12.216
Go ahead, Vincent.

12:12.258 --> 12:14.293
Tell your uncle Pete what
you're gonna major in.

12:15.961 --> 12:16.987
Viking culture.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.491
Viking culture.

12:19.533 --> 12:21.526
Can you believe
that's even a major?

12:21.568 --> 12:23.394
It's no wonder a
secondary education

12:23.436 --> 12:24.661
isn't worth shit anymore.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.196
Kinda like this house.

12:26.238 --> 12:28.232
Especially this house.

12:28.274 --> 12:30.934
Franky, are you
gonna eat anything?

12:30.976 --> 12:32.369
Don't eat.

12:32.411 --> 12:33.904
He's right, shouldn't
eat this stuff.

12:33.946 --> 12:34.946
This stuff?

12:34.980 --> 12:36.773
This is pizza.

12:36.815 --> 12:40.344
That is gluten,
dairy, and tomato paste.

12:40.386 --> 12:41.712
Will you please give it up

12:41.754 --> 12:43.714
with this gluten free bullshit?

12:43.756 --> 12:45.682
I'm sure there's a couple
of newlyweds out there

12:45.724 --> 12:46.935
that would find this house to be

12:46.959 --> 12:49.219
a perfect place
to start a family.

12:49.261 --> 12:50.455
Like mom and dad.

12:50.497 --> 12:52.823
I would rather go
down to the gas station,

12:52.865 --> 12:55.659
put my lips around
the pump, suck it dry,

12:55.701 --> 12:58.095
and then try to light
matches with my butt cheeks

12:58.137 --> 12:59.497
than have this place turned over

12:59.539 --> 13:01.198
to some bunch of bums.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.467
What bums?

13:02.509 --> 13:03.934
Do you guys even
get that this place

13:03.976 --> 13:06.278
is like a big deal
to some people?

13:07.614 --> 13:08.672
Right.

13:08.714 --> 13:09.907
No, seriously.

13:09.949 --> 13:11.909
There's so many forums
online about this place.

13:11.951 --> 13:13.677
Oh, here we go.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.719
Forums?

13:15.421 --> 13:17.681
Like, about the whooper?

13:17.723 --> 13:21.486
Forums, fan fictions,
cos-plays, you name it.

13:21.528 --> 13:23.655
Wait, you're telling me somebody

13:23.697 --> 13:25.689
has actually seen that
movie in the past 20 years.

13:25.731 --> 13:28.325
Well, they show it at
Halloween in theaters.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.894
Kind of like a retro revival.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.896
Yeah, well, dad had
another word for that.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.299
Maybe so, but everyone knows

13:35.341 --> 13:36.800
that the story is fiction.

13:36.842 --> 13:37.868
Fiction?

13:37.910 --> 13:39.102
Made up.

13:39.144 --> 13:41.838
This house isn't really haunted.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.575
Some might debate that.

13:43.617 --> 13:46.586
- Who, exactly?
- Well, grandma, for one.

13:48.020 --> 13:51.815
Vincent, grandma liked
to tell stories. Loved it.

13:51.857 --> 13:54.351
When she would go down to
the salon on the weekends,

13:54.393 --> 13:56.019
that's all those ladies did.

13:56.061 --> 13:58.755
Once, somebody took
something she said as fact,

13:58.797 --> 13:59.990
and the next thing you know,

14:00.032 --> 14:01.376
a movie studio was
knocking on the door,

14:01.400 --> 14:03.093
promising us this and that.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.063
Ruined my sophomore
year in high school.

14:06.105 --> 14:08.732
None of us were ever
haunted by our toys,

14:08.774 --> 14:11.335
or had exorcisms performed
on our stuffed animals.

14:11.377 --> 14:12.903
All I remember from that time

14:12.945 --> 14:16.173
was bouncing checks
and waterbeds.

14:16.215 --> 14:17.709
Well you can
believe what you want.

14:17.751 --> 14:19.611
And you can go on
those chat rooms,

14:19.653 --> 14:21.412
and tell everyone
that Peter schepp says

14:21.454 --> 14:24.181
that there's no such
thing as a whooper.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.349
What does that prove?

14:25.391 --> 14:27.084
Aren't I a character
in the story?

14:27.126 --> 14:29.319
That doesn't make it yours.

14:29.361 --> 14:32.457
The whooper belongs
to the fans now.

14:32.499 --> 14:34.024
Pete, let it go.

14:34.066 --> 14:36.360
Ticket sales, box
office revenue.

14:36.402 --> 14:38.061
That doesn't make any
sense to this kid.

14:38.103 --> 14:40.607
Reality doesn't make
any sense to this kid.

14:41.807 --> 14:43.242
If you'll please excuse me.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.615
Is that the best you
could do in handling that?

14:57.657 --> 15:00.350
Look, everything's all hookies

15:00.392 --> 15:02.319
and wog-warts with
this kid, alright?

15:02.361 --> 15:04.054
The more time he spends here,

15:04.096 --> 15:06.457
the better it's gonna
be for everybody.

15:06.499 --> 15:07.991
Trust me.

15:13.339 --> 15:14.565
May I help you?

15:14.607 --> 15:16.601
I'm here to see the house.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.368
You talk to the realty company?

15:18.410 --> 15:21.271
I talked to franky on the phone.

15:21.313 --> 15:22.313
It's late.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.084
One sec.

15:31.591 --> 15:32.949
A realtor, get
rid of this place.

15:32.991 --> 15:33.991
Don't you, Teri?

15:35.160 --> 15:36.496
Please, come in.

15:37.497 --> 15:38.997
Cathy, Cathy shingle.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.592
This is my sister.

15:41.634 --> 15:42.769
Teri, I know.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.166
Can I serve you something?

15:49.208 --> 15:51.968
Coffee, tea, water, milk?

15:52.010 --> 15:53.370
Where did you park?

15:53.412 --> 15:56.173
It's even more
beautiful in person.

15:56.215 --> 15:58.409
You kept all of
the original trim.

15:58.451 --> 15:59.651
Our family wasn't too familiar

15:59.686 --> 16:01.111
with the idea of remodeling.

16:01.153 --> 16:03.313
We're selling it as is.

16:03.355 --> 16:04.682
That's perfect.

16:04.724 --> 16:06.950
I can't wait to show
this to my babies.

16:06.992 --> 16:08.018
How many do you have?

16:08.060 --> 16:09.152
Four.

16:09.194 --> 16:10.688
Must be a handful.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.557
My brother told you
it's a three-bedroom?

16:12.599 --> 16:14.032
That's fine, just fine.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.834
What's this, the
friggin' pasta-razzi?

16:22.876 --> 16:24.067
Don't mind them.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.837
They get like this
after you feed them.

16:25.879 --> 16:27.538
No need to apologize.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.374
I remember how hard things
were after I lost daddy.

16:30.416 --> 16:33.343
This must be such a
difficult time for you all.

16:33.385 --> 16:35.979
I can't believe they're
all here, they're all here.

16:36.021 --> 16:37.189
Franky, tour?

16:42.261 --> 16:43.053
What?

16:43.095 --> 16:44.389
Don't be a douche!

16:44.431 --> 16:45.956
To who, the creep?

16:45.998 --> 16:47.625
So she's a little unusual.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.227
She looks like she raided
your high school wardrobe.

16:50.269 --> 16:52.764
She does.

16:53.740 --> 16:54.740
I'm sorry, what's that?

17:03.516 --> 17:05.685
Grownups can't hear you.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.125
Christmas tree.

17:16.128 --> 17:17.755
Rocking horse.

17:17.797 --> 17:19.256
Pipes.

17:19.298 --> 17:20.298
Basket.

17:21.768 --> 17:22.769
More baskets.

17:24.036 --> 17:25.404
Here's the washing machine.

17:46.459 --> 17:49.454
A hunter built this
place after the war.

17:49.496 --> 17:51.789
He used to skin
his game down here.

17:51.831 --> 17:53.458
Coyotes, mostly.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.594
One day, the hunter killed
something else out there.

17:56.636 --> 17:59.196
Something he had
never seen before.

17:59.238 --> 18:01.632
A creature that
resembled the folklore

18:01.674 --> 18:03.935
of the iroquois tribes.

18:03.977 --> 18:07.070
Unknowingly, the hunter
brought his strange kill

18:07.112 --> 18:08.673
back to this cellar.

18:08.715 --> 18:10.741
He disappeared sometime later,

18:10.783 --> 18:12.752
but the Mark of the
creature remained.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.446
The whooper?

18:15.488 --> 18:16.814
Everybody's seen that movie.

18:16.856 --> 18:19.049
My babies and I
watch it all the time.

18:19.091 --> 18:20.551
It's not for babies.

18:20.593 --> 18:21.552
Are these yours?

18:21.594 --> 18:22.787
My grandma's.

18:22.829 --> 18:24.072
Once they weren't
worth anything,

18:24.096 --> 18:25.297
she just boxed them up.

18:26.265 --> 18:27.734
Well, what's it worth to you?

18:29.334 --> 18:31.496
I would sell everything
to get her back.

18:31.538 --> 18:32.930
Oh, there you are.

18:32.972 --> 18:34.398
I've got something to show you.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.834
My favorite bathroom
is down here.

18:36.876 --> 18:37.835
Boy, I hope that lady

18:37.877 --> 18:38.669
doesn't find all
that lead paint.

18:38.711 --> 18:39.770
That'd be a disaster.

18:39.812 --> 18:41.572
Oh, hey guys.

18:41.614 --> 18:43.039
Didn't mean to
interrupt the tour.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.408
Did they say lead paint?

18:44.450 --> 18:45.676
I don't think so.

18:45.718 --> 18:47.979
There's no lead paint
down here, miss shingle.

18:48.021 --> 18:49.379
Same as these pipes.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.147
This house has its quirks,

18:51.189 --> 18:52.450
but we were all raised here,

18:52.492 --> 18:54.150
and look how we turned out.

18:54.192 --> 18:56.219
Wait, maybe that's
not the best example.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.488
What he's trying to say is that

18:57.530 --> 18:59.256
we wouldn't put you or
your family in danger

18:59.298 --> 19:00.525
just to make some money.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.627
They're just jacking
around, miss shingle.

19:02.669 --> 19:04.929
Your kids could probably
eat the paint chips

19:04.971 --> 19:06.464
right off the wall.

19:06.506 --> 19:09.165
See? Latex, non-toxic.

19:09.207 --> 19:12.035
My father repainted this
house back in the 80s.

19:12.077 --> 19:13.236
Franky.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.657
Do you want to see
me eat a chip of paint?

19:14.681 --> 19:16.007
Don't eat paint, franky.

19:16.049 --> 19:18.141
It's that safe.

19:18.183 --> 19:19.652
- Let me try.
- Vincent!

19:23.288 --> 19:26.017
I wanted to thank you all
so much for your hospitality.

19:26.059 --> 19:28.260
I could not be more in
love with this house.

19:30.797 --> 19:32.599
Now, will you take
a personal check?

19:33.533 --> 19:35.158
Is it from a local bank?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.060
Thanks, we'll consider it.

19:37.102 --> 19:38.142
Look, just give my brother

19:38.170 --> 19:39.463
a couple days to think about it.

19:39.505 --> 19:41.231
If there's a problem
with the amount,

19:41.273 --> 19:43.034
I'd be happy to increase it.

19:43.076 --> 19:44.535
I've thought about it.

19:44.577 --> 19:45.888
We'll give you a
call. You got a card?

19:45.912 --> 19:47.805
No, I'm afraid I
can't leave this house

19:47.847 --> 19:49.272
until there's a deal.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.141
See? She can't wait.

19:51.183 --> 19:53.978
Miss, my brother
isn't thinking straight.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.278
We've been through a lot

19:55.320 --> 19:56.881
with the death of
my mother and all.

19:56.923 --> 19:57.923
You'll understand.

19:57.957 --> 19:58.849
Of course.

19:58.891 --> 20:01.052
That's exactly why I'm here.

20:01.094 --> 20:03.020
Your mother meant so much to me.

20:03.062 --> 20:04.855
Please, I have to
have this house.

20:04.897 --> 20:06.323
- Please!
- Alright really?

20:06.365 --> 20:07.491
The house is not for sale.

20:07.533 --> 20:08.693
That's impossible.

20:08.735 --> 20:09.760
We're keeping it.

20:09.802 --> 20:12.162
That's not what she wanted.

20:12.204 --> 20:13.798
Dorothy, your mother,

20:13.840 --> 20:15.499
could not leave
the house to you,

20:15.541 --> 20:16.601
- I'm sorry.
- Frank,

20:16.643 --> 20:17.853
where did you get this lunatic?

20:17.877 --> 20:19.604
No matter what they
say, no matter what,

20:19.646 --> 20:21.338
she made me promise
right before she died,

20:21.380 --> 20:22.707
she made me promise.

20:22.749 --> 20:24.050
That's it, I'm out.

20:25.217 --> 20:27.210
This has been very interesting,

20:27.252 --> 20:30.448
but I'm really sure
that you need to go.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.850
Grandma, a note from grandma.

20:32.892 --> 20:35.686
Whatever it takes, no
matter what my family says,

20:35.728 --> 20:38.456
get this house from them
by any means necessary.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.690
You see?

20:39.732 --> 20:42.493
She wanted us to have the house.

20:42.535 --> 20:45.471
I'm sorry, she loved
you, but she was hurt.

20:47.239 --> 20:49.467
You know, I think I'll
go and take a walk,

20:49.509 --> 20:51.502
and let you guys think
of a suitable amount.

20:51.544 --> 20:53.169
But please, don't
make this harder

20:53.211 --> 20:54.514
than it already is.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.243
What are you talking
about, Dorothy?

21:00.285 --> 21:01.679
It's the kids.

21:01.721 --> 21:02.931
They think that their
critters are coming to life.

21:02.955 --> 21:04.265
Do you know how
you sound right now?

21:04.289 --> 21:05.516
I know, I know it sounds crazy,

21:05.558 --> 21:06.702
but what if it's not
the stuffed animals?

21:06.726 --> 21:07.936
What if it's something
inside of them?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.520
They're kids, they
have imaginations.

21:09.562 --> 21:11.789
We need to leave this house.

21:11.831 --> 21:12.723
I don't feel safe.

21:12.765 --> 21:13.991
Why don't we just go home?

21:14.033 --> 21:15.860
- Isn't this home?
- No.

21:15.902 --> 21:18.396
There is something
in that house.

21:18.438 --> 21:19.748
You don't know it because
you're never there,

21:19.772 --> 21:21.499
but I feel it, and
I am telling you.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.734
Don't you remember
living in the city?

21:23.776 --> 21:25.803
Having the night
shifts, the mill.

21:25.845 --> 21:27.780
I know, but this
is different, frank.

21:32.618 --> 21:34.352
I won't go back
to that, Dorothy.

21:35.455 --> 21:37.490
I worked too damn hard,
and I won't do it.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.860
The schepp family
has never escaped

21:49.902 --> 21:52.129
the shadow of the whooper.

21:52.171 --> 21:54.330
Despite its home video success,

21:54.372 --> 21:56.067
they never received a dime.

21:56.109 --> 21:57.200
In more recent news,

21:57.242 --> 21:59.103
they've even sued the studio

21:59.145 --> 22:00.805
for their lost royalties.

22:00.847 --> 22:02.506
Rumor has it that frank schepp

22:02.548 --> 22:04.875
has even declared bankruptcy.

22:04.917 --> 22:05.843
After this break,

22:05.885 --> 22:08.079
we'll be reading viewer emails.

22:08.121 --> 22:09.121
Stay with us.

22:15.962 --> 22:17.320
Who am I talking to?

22:17.362 --> 22:19.924
Something's a fact
because you saw it online?

22:19.966 --> 22:21.710
It could have been
photoshopped or something.

22:21.734 --> 22:22.860
Right, Vince?

22:22.902 --> 22:24.128
Well if it was real,

22:24.170 --> 22:26.130
it's gotta be the only
fan mail she ever got.

22:26.172 --> 22:27.698
I'm surprised she
didn't adopt her.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.118
She never told me
about any of this.

22:29.142 --> 22:30.434
Oh, you asked?

22:30.476 --> 22:32.603
Look, none of this
is legal material.

22:32.645 --> 22:34.337
It'll never hold up in court.

22:34.379 --> 22:36.140
We can blow her off
as long as it takes.

22:36.182 --> 22:37.742
But if it's what
grandma really wanted.

22:37.784 --> 22:39.375
Vincent, stay out of this.

22:39.417 --> 22:42.012
If mom didn't want
franky to have the house,

22:42.054 --> 22:43.814
she wouldn't have left
it to him in her will.

22:43.856 --> 22:45.049
Right, franky?

22:45.091 --> 22:46.617
Senior left her the
house when he died.

22:46.659 --> 22:49.720
And she couldn't amend
it in her last will.

22:49.762 --> 22:51.039
That's 'cause he didn't
trust her with anything,

22:51.063 --> 22:52.656
not even in death.

22:52.698 --> 22:53.657
Don't tell me you're thinking

22:53.699 --> 22:55.159
about selling it to this woman.

22:55.201 --> 22:57.561
It's my think to think.

22:57.603 --> 22:58.796
Christ!

22:58.838 --> 23:00.397
Mom didn't actually
know this Cathy.

23:00.439 --> 23:03.067
Did Cathy ever visit
mom when she was alive?

23:03.109 --> 23:04.635
Did she ever change the sheets?

23:04.677 --> 23:05.703
Or a bed pan?

23:05.745 --> 23:07.738
The market's bad right now.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.573
Why does it have
to be a price point?

23:09.615 --> 23:11.709
Why can't we just let it go?

23:11.751 --> 23:12.910
Let it be a memory.

23:12.952 --> 23:14.263
What, are you
afraid of something?

23:14.287 --> 23:15.679
Of what, of whooper?

23:15.721 --> 23:18.215
I don't believe
in it as paranormal.

23:18.257 --> 23:20.684
More of a supernatural abstract.

23:20.726 --> 23:24.455
Maybe it's not something
that we can touch or measure,

23:24.497 --> 23:27.057
but it's something
we experience.

23:27.099 --> 23:28.492
Like a thought.

23:28.534 --> 23:29.727
Or a memory.

23:29.769 --> 23:31.462
He's always been afraid.

23:31.504 --> 23:33.164
We used to lock
him in this cellar

23:33.206 --> 23:36.133
until he'd kick and
scream to high heaven.

23:36.175 --> 23:38.135
Well, I was four.

23:38.177 --> 23:40.471
We did it when you were 16, too.

23:40.513 --> 23:43.240
That was before he
became Dr. Peter.

23:43.282 --> 23:44.909
Don't change the subject.

23:44.951 --> 23:46.110
Want to do it again?

23:46.152 --> 23:48.245
What, stay down in the cellar?

23:48.287 --> 23:49.413
I'll go down in the cellar.

23:49.455 --> 23:51.115
- In your dreams.
- Guys.

23:51.157 --> 23:53.217
- Piece of cake.
- Your funeral.

23:53.259 --> 23:55.252
- Want to make a bet?
- Sure.

23:55.294 --> 23:57.588
If you can stay
down in the cellar

23:57.630 --> 23:59.966
long enough to
finish a six pack,

24:01.000 --> 24:02.367
I'll give you 50 bucks.

24:08.007 --> 24:09.007
You're on.

24:16.115 --> 24:17.575
You're leaving?

24:17.617 --> 24:18.627
Well, unless you want
to open the shop tomorrow.

24:18.651 --> 24:20.044
Be my guest.

24:20.086 --> 24:21.395
What about the crazy
lady in the yard?

24:21.419 --> 24:22.780
I wouldn't worry about her.

24:22.822 --> 24:25.082
If she gets out of
hand, call Clint.

24:25.124 --> 24:26.817
He'll know what to do.

24:26.859 --> 24:28.686
Oh hey, if you find
that beef-a-roni recipe,

24:28.728 --> 24:30.329
send me a text, alright?

24:49.048 --> 24:50.373
County is currently

24:50.415 --> 24:53.210
under a winter storm watch.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.276
- Theo, what's the-
- hey hey hey.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.259
Remember that problem we had?

25:42.301 --> 25:43.827
Yeah, well I think I fixed it.

25:43.869 --> 25:45.095
What are you talking about?

25:45.137 --> 25:46.872
Just get out here,
out front, hurry up.

25:54.847 --> 25:56.340
- You think she's-
- I don't know!

25:56.382 --> 25:58.575
She was just standing there
in the middle of the road.

25:58.617 --> 25:59.695
You didn't see
her in the mirror?

25:59.719 --> 26:01.011
We gotta call Clint.

26:01.053 --> 26:02.079
- Clint?
- Yeah.

26:02.121 --> 26:03.514
He'll know what to do.

26:03.556 --> 26:05.549
- Yeah, call an ambulance.
- No, no ambulance.

26:05.591 --> 26:07.051
I'm sorry, what
are you suggesting

26:07.093 --> 26:08.052
Clint knows how to do?

26:08.094 --> 26:09.787
Well you know, clean it up.

26:09.829 --> 26:12.222
You think Clint knows
how to dispose a body?

26:12.264 --> 26:14.558
The man would open a vein
for you, you know that.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.760
Besides, who's gonna
help us with all this?

26:16.802 --> 26:18.228
- Us?
- Yes, us.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.463
You! You, not us!

26:19.505 --> 26:21.433
Look at the big picture.

26:21.475 --> 26:22.718
This could destroy
the whole family.

26:22.742 --> 26:24.068
Ruin everything dad worked for.

26:24.110 --> 26:26.770
This is like the final
nail in the waterbed.

26:26.812 --> 26:28.639
I will take no part in this.

26:28.681 --> 26:31.409
Fine, you don't want
to help me, don't.

26:31.451 --> 26:32.452
Do it for mom.

26:43.529 --> 26:45.222
Son of a bitch.

26:45.264 --> 26:47.392
Hey! Hey!

26:47.434 --> 26:48.759
You want to put
something online,

26:48.801 --> 26:50.828
I'll give you something
to put online!

26:52.238 --> 26:53.238
Theo!

27:55.167 --> 27:56.167
Teri!

28:06.312 --> 28:08.147
This is all his stuff.

28:10.216 --> 28:11.742
Teri!

29:01.066 --> 29:02.066
Look, I,

29:03.269 --> 29:04.703
I know you hate your father.

29:06.138 --> 29:08.140
But he's not so bad.

29:09.275 --> 29:13.270
Your grandfather was much worse.

29:14.747 --> 29:18.142
We only saw him in the
morning on the way to work.

29:18.184 --> 29:19.977
He rarely spoke.

29:28.727 --> 29:29.905
Well, you shouldn't
have left it out

29:29.929 --> 29:31.096
in the first place.

29:35.801 --> 29:38.795
Ugh!

29:38.837 --> 29:41.765
Your dad kicked the
chair under the table.

29:41.807 --> 29:43.867
Now, we were the
only ones to see it,

29:43.909 --> 29:45.302
but for a second,

29:45.344 --> 29:48.406
it was like the whole
rotation of the earth ceased,

29:48.448 --> 29:50.950
and we were all suspended.

29:53.219 --> 29:54.612
The next few weeks,

29:54.654 --> 29:56.255
it was all mom would talk about.

29:59.892 --> 30:01.595
The whole story of the movie,

30:03.262 --> 30:06.566
we reinvented it, by accident.

30:08.834 --> 30:11.003
Well, now you know.

30:15.642 --> 30:16.800
Thanks, uncle franky,

30:16.842 --> 30:18.335
but currently I
don't have any room

30:18.377 --> 30:21.847
for unverifiable verbal
testimony in my research.

31:09.194 --> 31:10.555
Hey, how long does it take

31:10.597 --> 31:12.532
to Polish off a six pack?

31:25.110 --> 31:26.110
Pete, Pete!

31:33.218 --> 31:35.513
Still a lightweight, huh?

31:35.555 --> 31:38.650
Oh, senior would be
so pissed at you.

31:38.692 --> 31:39.692
Come on.

31:41.561 --> 31:42.696
There's something,

31:43.697 --> 31:45.264
something down here.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.392
Oh no, no, this way,
this way, this way.

32:14.259 --> 32:15.259
Almost there.

32:15.961 --> 32:17.821
There you go.

32:17.863 --> 32:20.433
I guess you're gonna have
to reschedule that flight.

32:57.403 --> 32:58.403
Oh yeah.

34:18.685 --> 34:19.685
Franky?

34:21.286 --> 34:22.286
Peter.

38:36.709 --> 38:39.235
Get out of here, move!

38:43.716 --> 38:45.051
God I'm sorry.

38:46.351 --> 38:51.356
What the hell?

39:34.299 --> 39:35.668
It was either him or you.

39:37.570 --> 39:39.230
People can get so disgusting.

39:39.272 --> 39:40.865
What is that thing?

39:40.907 --> 39:42.133
Don't you remember this?

39:42.175 --> 39:42.933
Pete made it, like
in seventh grade,

39:42.975 --> 39:44.835
for some science fair.

39:44.877 --> 39:45.936
Is Teri with you?

39:45.978 --> 39:48.172
No, no no, I haven't seen her.

39:48.214 --> 39:51.374
Maybe we should contact the
authorities, or something.

39:51.416 --> 39:53.177
We're trespassing.

39:53.219 --> 39:54.520
Come on, Vincent, pick up.

40:13.639 --> 40:15.908
One, two, three.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.587
- Get out of here.
- Get him out of there.

40:18.611 --> 40:19.721
- Come on, get him out.
- Come on.

40:19.745 --> 40:21.605
Get him.

40:21.647 --> 40:22.647
Son of a...

40:23.950 --> 40:25.109
It's Vincent's phone!

40:25.151 --> 40:27.211
Must be some kind
of fetish thing.

40:27.253 --> 40:28.712
Well, they came
to the wrong house.

40:28.754 --> 40:31.314
Where's my son? Where's my boy?

40:31.356 --> 40:32.583
Where's Vincent?

40:32.625 --> 40:33.969
Is this a joke to you,
is that what this is?

40:33.993 --> 40:34.919
Is this some kind of joke?

40:34.961 --> 40:36.487
I'll show you a joke.

40:36.529 --> 40:38.923
I will put this ball
bearing right up your ass.

40:38.965 --> 40:41.058
You're gonna waddle out of
here instead of walking.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.325
Now where is my son?

40:42.367 --> 40:43.294
Theo, that's not gonna help us.

40:43.336 --> 40:44.762
When I walked in this room,

40:44.804 --> 40:46.530
one of these things
was about to kill you.

40:46.572 --> 40:48.732
But we've gotta keep our cool.

40:48.774 --> 40:50.366
I am cool!

40:50.408 --> 40:51.468
- Oh Theo.
- I'm cool.

40:51.510 --> 40:52.770
Now what is your plan?

40:52.812 --> 40:55.172
We need to find
Teri and Vincent,

40:55.214 --> 40:57.007
and get the hell out of here.

40:57.049 --> 40:59.176
All that missing stuff
Teri was talking about,

40:59.218 --> 41:00.218
dad's stuff.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.012
I found it out in the woods,

41:02.054 --> 41:03.280
out in the middle of nowhere,

41:03.322 --> 41:04.867
all stacked up like it
was some sort of nest.

41:04.891 --> 41:06.851
I don't know what
these people are up to,

41:06.893 --> 41:09.220
but I don't think they
planned on us holding out.

41:09.262 --> 41:12.523
Yeah, well, this,

41:12.565 --> 41:14.233
this is gonna complicate things.

41:15.801 --> 41:17.761
You know, the second
best way to get a customer

41:17.803 --> 41:19.530
by the balls?

41:19.572 --> 41:21.732
An undeniable markdown.

41:21.774 --> 41:23.033
But you know the first?

41:23.075 --> 41:25.336
- What?
- Insurance.

41:25.378 --> 41:26.804
They've got Vincent.

41:26.846 --> 41:27.771
They're gonna use him to get

41:27.813 --> 41:30.207
whatever it is they want.

41:30.249 --> 41:32.985
But now, we've
got one of theirs.

42:31.811 --> 42:32.811
Clint?

42:33.746 --> 42:34.746
Clint.

42:36.282 --> 42:37.282
Oh hey, ter.

42:39.018 --> 42:40.386
What happened with us, ter?

42:49.962 --> 42:51.455
There's something
you have to know.

42:51.497 --> 42:54.358
In the emails from your
mother, I found something.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.561
One of your brothers, they knew.

42:57.603 --> 42:58.647
They signed off on this deal

42:58.671 --> 43:00.197
before Cathy ever got here.

43:00.239 --> 43:01.239
What? Who?

43:02.408 --> 43:03.968
Oh, this is all a setup.

43:04.010 --> 43:05.502
You gotta get out of here.

43:05.544 --> 43:06.637
Not without you.

43:06.679 --> 43:07.905
I'm gonna slow you down.

43:07.947 --> 43:09.673
You gotta run.

43:09.715 --> 43:11.008
Stay with me, Clint.

43:11.050 --> 43:12.943
Don't quit on me.

43:12.985 --> 43:13.985
I never quit.

43:19.358 --> 43:20.718
You want more Gore?

43:20.760 --> 43:21.919
Subscribe to our newsletter.

43:21.961 --> 43:23.963
We'll be right back
with more movie corner.

43:37.477 --> 43:39.136
Sweet boy.

43:39.178 --> 43:40.480
Sweet, sweet boy.

43:44.617 --> 43:47.177
Mama's so proud of you.

43:47.219 --> 43:48.287
So, so proud.

43:50.923 --> 43:51.815
You know better than to speak

43:51.857 --> 43:53.259
when you're under the spell.

43:57.196 --> 44:01.167
We're finally here where we
belong, in our safe place.

44:02.436 --> 44:05.237
Aren't we happy?
Aren't we having fun?

44:06.639 --> 44:07.898
Aren't we?

44:07.940 --> 44:09.767
We've waited too long for this,

44:09.809 --> 44:11.068
and now we will enjoy it

44:11.110 --> 44:14.071
for the rest of
our days, together.

44:15.414 --> 44:17.616
Guys, guys!

44:19.519 --> 44:21.745
Hand over the teenager!

44:24.123 --> 44:27.827
You got two minutes!

44:31.931 --> 44:33.433
They don't want to play with us.

44:35.601 --> 44:37.094
Fine.

44:37.136 --> 44:39.630
Their time is up, and they
don't belong here anymore.

44:39.672 --> 44:42.232
I was generous because
I felt sorry for them,

44:42.274 --> 44:43.967
and look what that got us.

44:44.009 --> 44:46.136
If they won't give
us what is ours,

44:46.178 --> 44:48.515
then we must take it!

44:56.456 --> 44:58.348
Last chance, guys.

44:58.390 --> 45:00.025
Hand over the teenager.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.162
Or it's off to the
batting cage for this one.

45:13.839 --> 45:16.200
Look, I don't want
to draw this out,

45:16.242 --> 45:19.537
and hopefully we
can resolve this,

45:19.579 --> 45:20.880
for your friend's sake.

45:34.594 --> 45:36.720
You think we're messing around,

45:36.762 --> 45:38.355
you're badly mistaken.

45:38.397 --> 45:39.832
This is all our house,

45:40.900 --> 45:42.168
and you answer to us!

45:53.812 --> 45:55.607
They're moving around.

45:55.649 --> 45:57.007
Where?

45:57.049 --> 45:58.317
They'll be coming down.

45:59.452 --> 46:01.111
Just keep your
eye on the stairs.

46:01.153 --> 46:02.188
Just like we planned.

46:09.629 --> 46:10.896
What are they doing?

46:12.131 --> 46:13.090
I don't know.

46:13.132 --> 46:14.767
You've got two minutes!

46:32.485 --> 46:34.111
This has got to be wired wrong.

46:34.153 --> 46:36.447
It can't be right.

46:36.489 --> 46:38.048
Damn it, Pete!

46:39.225 --> 46:40.083
What are you doing?

46:40.125 --> 46:41.251
Stick with the plan.

46:44.330 --> 46:45.956
Damn it, Pete.

46:45.998 --> 46:48.367
Now is not the time
to fool around-

47:16.362 --> 47:17.362
Damn it, Pete!

47:39.251 --> 47:40.043
Freeze!

47:40.085 --> 47:41.211
Freeze, all of you,

47:41.253 --> 47:44.616
or I blow this
whole place to hell.

47:44.658 --> 47:47.719
I'm holding a remote to
four pounds of c4 wired

47:47.761 --> 47:49.920
to the foundation of the house.

47:49.962 --> 47:51.623
Hi babies, it's mama.

47:51.665 --> 47:54.592
I just want to let you
know everything's fine.

47:54.634 --> 47:56.793
Teri's just a little
rattled right now.

47:56.835 --> 47:57.835
Rattled?

47:57.870 --> 48:00.063
Do I look rattled to you?

48:00.105 --> 48:01.898
Does anybody else here
think I'm rattled?

48:01.940 --> 48:03.133
Show of hands.

48:03.175 --> 48:05.503
It's not funny to
joke like that, Teri.

48:07.046 --> 48:08.640
Teri, Teri, it's franky.

48:08.682 --> 48:09.741
He's not moving.

48:09.783 --> 48:10.992
I think it's his blood pressure.

48:11.016 --> 48:12.456
We gotta get him to
a hospital quick.

48:12.485 --> 48:14.011
No one moves.

48:14.053 --> 48:15.446
What?

48:15.488 --> 48:17.848
No one leaves here
until I get some answers.

48:17.890 --> 48:19.850
Franky is not moving.

48:19.892 --> 48:22.720
Someone down there
is lying to all of us.

48:22.762 --> 48:23.987
I don't understand.

48:24.029 --> 48:26.624
One of you knew about
this caveat long before.

48:26.666 --> 48:29.627
One of you put us
into this mess.

48:29.669 --> 48:33.230
Sure, mom may have been
losing it towards the end.

48:33.272 --> 48:35.098
She may have given
Cathy the house,

48:35.140 --> 48:37.267
and not her own flesh and blood.

48:37.309 --> 48:40.904
But she couldn't have sent
years of emails herself.

48:40.946 --> 48:44.542
Computer illiterate, hands
mangled from arthritis.

48:44.584 --> 48:47.344
And she definitely couldn't
have sent any emails

48:47.386 --> 48:50.013
a week after she died.

48:50.055 --> 48:50.847
I don't follow.

48:50.889 --> 48:51.982
I saw the emails,

48:52.024 --> 48:53.884
and I saw the time stamps.

48:53.926 --> 48:55.218
She had help.

48:55.260 --> 48:56.920
Someone was using her account

48:56.962 --> 48:59.856
to talk to Cathy long
after she passed.

48:59.898 --> 49:01.526
Someone set us up.

49:01.568 --> 49:03.561
I'm sure there's
another explanation.

49:03.603 --> 49:05.862
Really? I would love one.

49:05.904 --> 49:08.198
Teri, listen to
what you're saying!

49:08.240 --> 49:09.752
I mean, look, they're just
trying to get into your head.

49:09.776 --> 49:11.310
This is all part of their plan.

49:12.512 --> 49:13.671
You were always good

49:13.713 --> 49:16.474
at making other people
look guilty, Theo.

49:16.516 --> 49:18.241
You know what, I'm gonna forget

49:18.283 --> 49:19.444
that you even said that.

49:19.486 --> 49:22.447
And then again,
like father like son.

49:22.489 --> 49:25.048
Maybe the fan boy was
in on it all along.

49:25.090 --> 49:26.718
He's been here all this time.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.086
Got along with Cathy so well.

49:29.128 --> 49:30.287
Vincent?

49:30.329 --> 49:31.689
Or is it possible

49:31.731 --> 49:33.558
that the only one
of us who wanted to

49:33.600 --> 49:36.326
give the house to
her is behind this.

49:36.368 --> 49:38.730
He'd sell that place
out in a heartbeat,

49:38.772 --> 49:40.832
as long as it lined his wallet.

49:40.874 --> 49:41.766
Wait a minute, here.

49:41.808 --> 49:44.201
And then there's the psycho,

49:44.243 --> 49:48.171
who rigged our mom's basement
with plastic explosives.

49:48.213 --> 49:49.774
Could it have been him?

49:49.816 --> 49:51.609
Hey Pete, how do I
know this thing works?

49:51.651 --> 49:53.444
Is there a button I press?

49:53.486 --> 49:56.380
Or maybe, it was all of you.

49:56.422 --> 49:59.684
The prodigal sons return
to take back what's theirs.

49:59.726 --> 50:03.153
You four were like leaves in
the breeze while I stayed.

50:03.195 --> 50:05.390
I stayed by her side.

50:05.432 --> 50:07.290
I watched her wither away.

50:07.332 --> 50:10.495
You think you're the
only one that sacrificed?

50:10.537 --> 50:12.028
Franky and I tied ourselves

50:12.070 --> 50:13.464
to that sinking
ship of a business

50:13.506 --> 50:15.500
the day senior passed away.

50:15.542 --> 50:17.367
You don't think I wanted
to just disappear?

50:17.409 --> 50:19.936
Move out west, to some
suburb or something,

50:19.978 --> 50:21.806
and forgot about everything?

50:21.848 --> 50:23.441
Maybe it's you.

50:23.483 --> 50:24.675
Maybe you wanted someone

50:24.717 --> 50:25.960
to take the pressure
off of your shoulders.

50:25.984 --> 50:27.879
Maybe you're looking
for a scapegoat.

50:27.921 --> 50:29.447
You said it yourself.

50:29.489 --> 50:30.699
You were there all by yourself.

50:30.723 --> 50:31.616
No one was around.

50:31.658 --> 50:33.551
You had access to her accounts.

50:33.593 --> 50:34.661
Maybe you're right.

50:36.228 --> 50:38.689
Maybe I am ready to
give this place up.

50:38.731 --> 50:40.991
After all, it was her last wish.

50:41.033 --> 50:43.026
The only difference is

50:43.068 --> 50:46.431
I don't want a
number or a price.

50:46.473 --> 50:48.373
I just want a name.

50:50.810 --> 50:52.068
Give it to me.

50:52.110 --> 50:53.489
I have nothing to
hide from you, Teri.

50:53.513 --> 50:55.582
Give it to me!

50:59.351 --> 51:00.385
Show her.

51:16.970 --> 51:18.496
Come on, franky.

51:18.538 --> 51:19.639
Come on, now, come on.

51:20.473 --> 51:21.364
Teri!

51:21.406 --> 51:22.265
Teri, he is not moving.

51:22.307 --> 51:23.501
He's not reactive.

51:23.543 --> 51:24.903
We've got to get
him to a hospital!

51:24.944 --> 51:27.270
Why did you have
to make this so hard?

51:27.312 --> 51:28.806
Teri, help us!

51:28.848 --> 51:30.058
I don't care what
you think happened,

51:30.082 --> 51:31.551
we've got to get
him to a hospital!

51:45.097 --> 51:46.097
Welcome home.

51:56.108 --> 51:57.702
It's a syncopic episode.

51:57.744 --> 51:59.437
He's stable, but
he needs a doctor.

51:59.479 --> 52:00.638
Teri, get in the truck.

52:00.680 --> 52:01.873
Come on, nobody stays behind.

52:01.915 --> 52:02.840
I'm staying.

52:02.882 --> 52:04.140
I'm rigging those charges.

52:04.182 --> 52:05.476
What? Why?

52:05.518 --> 52:07.612
Because fuck them, that's why.

52:07.654 --> 52:09.814
Teri, you said it yourself.

52:09.856 --> 52:11.314
If this is what mom wanted,

52:11.356 --> 52:12.450
then let 'em have it.

52:12.492 --> 52:14.685
That was our home, Theo!

52:14.727 --> 52:16.754
We slept in those rooms.

52:16.796 --> 52:19.790
She died in those rooms.

52:19.832 --> 52:20.892
I'm not gonna stand by

52:20.934 --> 52:22.894
and let some freaks turn it in

52:22.936 --> 52:25.328
to some kind of fantasy.

52:25.370 --> 52:27.473
That place is our memories.

52:28.908 --> 52:31.702
And now that's all it will be.

52:31.744 --> 52:34.037
I'm only sorry not all my
brothers felt the same.

52:34.079 --> 52:35.473
Oh come on now.

52:35.515 --> 52:37.408
He couldn't have known
this was gonna happen.

52:37.450 --> 52:39.342
This is just franky, you know.

52:39.384 --> 52:41.153
Yeah, I know.

52:50.997 --> 52:51.997
Pete!

52:56.101 --> 52:58.236
Vincent, get in the truck.

53:00.974 --> 53:02.374
Couldn't find any shells.

53:58.798 --> 54:01.134
Hey, cut it out back there!

54:21.286 --> 54:23.014
I'm pretty sure
they're both fractured.

54:23.056 --> 54:24.615
What happened?

54:24.657 --> 54:25.657
Franky.

54:30.596 --> 54:32.131
I just wish...

54:34.266 --> 54:35.559
It's too late.

54:35.601 --> 54:37.193
Cathy was all she
had in the end.

54:37.235 --> 54:39.597
So it's no wonder
any of this happened.

54:39.639 --> 54:41.599
We helped her invent this.

54:41.641 --> 54:43.134
We were kids!

54:43.176 --> 54:44.702
It doesn't make
it any less true.

54:44.744 --> 54:46.269
You want to sit
here and talk about

54:46.311 --> 54:48.606
how this could've
been different, fine.

54:48.648 --> 54:51.174
But that doesn't
change anything.

54:54.687 --> 54:55.687
No.

54:56.656 --> 54:58.049
Not yet.

54:58.091 --> 54:59.315
What?

54:59.357 --> 55:01.652
All my life, I've been
running from this place.

55:01.694 --> 55:04.388
From senior, from
mom and her bullshit.

55:04.430 --> 55:06.230
You're not thinking
about going back in there.

55:06.264 --> 55:07.958
Maybe it's not too late.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.960
We wind the timer,
give us more time.

55:10.002 --> 55:12.163
We can disconnect
the charges by hand.

55:12.205 --> 55:13.329
By your hands.

55:13.371 --> 55:15.475
What happened to
just letting things go?

55:17.210 --> 55:19.979
Some kid told me
memories are an abstract.

55:21.047 --> 55:23.415
That is our house.

56:20.405 --> 56:23.501
Screw you! You little shit!

56:26.078 --> 56:27.872
If anything happens, we get out.

56:27.914 --> 56:29.573
- Sure.
- I mean it.

56:29.615 --> 56:32.308
We abandon the mission, promise.

56:32.350 --> 56:33.544
Teri, we've got 40-

56:33.586 --> 56:35.513
- the only way I go
back in that house

56:35.555 --> 56:37.047
is if you promise you'll get

56:37.089 --> 56:40.484
as far away from their as
possible before it blows.

56:40.526 --> 56:42.318
Alright, I promise.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.621
Okay.

56:43.663 --> 56:45.865
If you're ready, then, let's go.

57:15.728 --> 57:16.728
Which?

57:18.331 --> 57:19.397
One second.

57:21.434 --> 57:22.793
You don't remember?

57:22.835 --> 57:25.062
This shit's from Venezuela.

57:25.104 --> 57:27.106
Rojo, blanco, or azul?

57:29.175 --> 57:30.175
Blanco.

57:32.612 --> 57:33.612
Blanco.

57:45.091 --> 57:45.983
That's it.

57:46.025 --> 57:46.884
Easy enough.

57:46.926 --> 57:48.361
Three more to go.

57:54.901 --> 57:56.760
I'll kill you!

57:56.802 --> 58:00.698
You have no business here!

58:00.740 --> 58:02.233
You don't fuck with
my wife's family,

58:02.275 --> 58:04.635
you don't fuck with me!

58:40.846 --> 58:42.873
Teri!

1:00:21.313 --> 1:00:22.313
Teri.

1:00:23.416 --> 1:00:26.343
Teri, Teri, are you still there?

1:00:26.385 --> 1:00:27.385
Hello?

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:48.941
Where are you?

1:00:50.576 --> 1:00:52.711
Come out here, you coward!

1:01:15.067 --> 1:01:16.794
Don't shoot! Don't
shoot, don't shoot!

1:01:16.836 --> 1:01:18.270
It's me, Vincent!

1:01:19.305 --> 1:01:20.697
Vincent schepp?

1:01:20.739 --> 1:01:22.775
Yeah, we met at the
reunion like four years ago.

1:01:27.379 --> 1:01:28.939
I can't believe you'd,

1:01:28.981 --> 1:01:30.508
you'd treat your own
family like this.

1:01:49.702 --> 1:01:50.702
Dad?

1:02:45.458 --> 1:02:46.350
What was that?

1:02:46.392 --> 1:02:47.985
She's killing you!

1:02:48.027 --> 1:02:49.286
She's killing all of you!

1:02:49.328 --> 1:02:51.755
Why are you letting
her do this to you?

1:02:51.797 --> 1:02:53.257
They can't answer you, Teri.

1:02:53.299 --> 1:02:55.726
Come on, we've got
to get out of here!

1:02:55.768 --> 1:02:58.262
She's killing you!

1:02:58.304 --> 1:02:59.763
Why are you doing this?

1:02:59.805 --> 1:03:01.533
I really hate to see
you this way, Teri.

1:03:01.575 --> 1:03:02.666
Where are the keys?

1:03:02.708 --> 1:03:03.667
What keys?

1:03:03.709 --> 1:03:04.935
Let them out of this shit.

1:03:04.977 --> 1:03:06.177
They're gonna get heat stroke.

1:03:06.212 --> 1:03:08.305
They're not my prisoners.

1:03:08.347 --> 1:03:11.476
This woman is killing you.

1:03:11.518 --> 1:03:13.810
Look, she's already killed you.

1:03:13.852 --> 1:03:16.113
No, you are, Teri.

1:03:16.155 --> 1:03:17.347
You are.

1:03:17.389 --> 1:03:19.349
But it's okay, this
is what they want.

1:03:19.391 --> 1:03:20.402
You've got to get out of here.

1:03:20.426 --> 1:03:21.685
There's no time.

1:03:21.727 --> 1:03:23.663
We can't leave, we
have to celebrate.

1:03:30.736 --> 1:03:33.297
I am so happy that you were able

1:03:33.339 --> 1:03:35.165
to make it back for the end.

1:03:35.207 --> 1:03:36.033
The end of what?

1:03:36.075 --> 1:03:37.076
Of the movie!

1:03:40.112 --> 1:03:42.940
We've been broadcasting
this all over the world,

1:03:42.982 --> 1:03:44.107
for everyone to see.

1:03:44.149 --> 1:03:45.452
Isn't that amazing?

1:03:46.519 --> 1:03:49.614
You mean, it's live streaming?

1:03:49.656 --> 1:03:50.656
Yes.

1:03:53.325 --> 1:03:55.520
But, who's watching?

1:03:55.562 --> 1:03:58.698
People just like us,
all over the world.

1:04:00.799 --> 1:04:03.327
Why didn't they help us?

1:04:03.369 --> 1:04:05.137
Why didn't they do anything?

1:04:06.238 --> 1:04:08.232
Why didn't you do anything?

1:04:08.274 --> 1:04:09.500
Because they've been waiting,

1:04:09.542 --> 1:04:11.034
and it's finally here!

1:04:11.076 --> 1:04:12.302
Waiting for what?

1:04:12.344 --> 1:04:14.972
For the sequel,
and they love it.

1:04:15.014 --> 1:04:17.816
Your mother is smiling
down on us from heaven.

1:04:19.118 --> 1:04:20.386
You're all insane.

1:04:21.521 --> 1:04:22.746
We're leaving.

1:04:22.788 --> 1:04:24.515
We can't go, we
have to celebrate!

1:04:24.557 --> 1:04:25.557
Burn in hell!

1:04:27.661 --> 1:04:28.453
Hey, Teri.

1:04:28.495 --> 1:04:30.029
There's my kid brother.

1:04:31.196 --> 1:04:33.290
I thought I would
miss the party.

1:04:36.670 --> 1:04:39.739
I found this in one of
dad's old hiding places.

1:04:40.873 --> 1:04:43.701
Along with that
beef-a-roni recipe.

1:04:43.743 --> 1:04:44.743
What are you doing here?

1:04:44.778 --> 1:04:46.203
Where's franky?

1:04:46.245 --> 1:04:47.804
He's okay.

1:04:47.846 --> 1:04:49.741
He's with the paramedics.

1:04:49.783 --> 1:04:51.942
Can not wait to see
the look on his face.

1:04:51.984 --> 1:04:52.984
It was you?

1:04:53.753 --> 1:04:55.154
You signed the deal?

1:04:56.121 --> 1:04:57.823
Here, open that.

1:05:00.694 --> 1:05:02.352
Why would you sell us out?

1:05:02.394 --> 1:05:04.121
Sell us out?

1:05:04.163 --> 1:05:05.163
I saved us!

1:05:06.666 --> 1:05:08.292
Think about it.

1:05:08.334 --> 1:05:10.160
Do you have any idea
how many online orders

1:05:10.202 --> 1:05:13.096
have come into schepp
waterbeds just tonight?

1:05:13.138 --> 1:05:16.501
Dad worked himself to the
bone in that shop for nothing,

1:05:16.543 --> 1:05:18.670
nothing but an early grave.

1:05:18.712 --> 1:05:21.171
Now we're in the black.

1:05:21.213 --> 1:05:24.316
And I get to sit back and
relax in my golden years.

1:05:26.218 --> 1:05:28.045
Look, I get it, I get it.

1:05:28.087 --> 1:05:30.314
You're upset at me, I get it.

1:05:30.356 --> 1:05:32.983
Things did not go as
smoothly as I had hoped.

1:05:33.025 --> 1:05:34.585
We were assaulted.

1:05:34.627 --> 1:05:36.253
People died.

1:05:36.295 --> 1:05:38.489
You exploited our inheritance.

1:05:38.531 --> 1:05:42.192
Our inheritance is
the keys to this castle,

1:05:42.234 --> 1:05:43.436
which we have to defend.

1:05:44.738 --> 1:05:46.698
I didn't have a choice!

1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:48.865
This family has more money now

1:05:48.907 --> 1:05:51.134
than it ever has, ever.

1:05:51.176 --> 1:05:52.545
And that's because of me!

1:05:53.946 --> 1:05:57.950
Today, today is the schepp
family's finest hour!

1:05:59.952 --> 1:06:01.286
To new beginnings.

1:06:09.361 --> 1:06:10.822
It's too late.

1:07:06.553 --> 1:07:07.929
Hey, do you have
a phone I could use?

1:07:07.953 --> 1:07:09.823
I just need to call my mom.

1:07:10.924 --> 1:07:11.924
Sure.

1:07:17.162 --> 1:07:18.656
What's this?

1:07:18.698 --> 1:07:20.265
It's just a jacket.

1:07:21.434 --> 1:07:22.635
Like some viking shit.

1:07:25.705 --> 1:07:26.916
I feel like I've seen
your face before.

1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:27.940
Do I know you?

1:07:29.174 --> 1:07:31.268
I don't think so.

1:07:31.310 --> 1:07:34.046
Like a meme one of my
friend's sent me, or something.

1:07:35.849 --> 1:07:38.008
She's probably not up yet.

1:07:38.050 --> 1:07:39.127
Thanks for letting
me use your phone.

1:07:39.151 --> 1:07:40.151
Sure.

1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:41.945
You stay around here?

1:07:41.987 --> 1:07:43.355
I can give you a lift.

1:07:44.356 --> 1:07:45.583
No, that's okay.

1:07:45.625 --> 1:07:47.552
I'll just walk to
the quick-e-mart.

1:07:47.594 --> 1:07:49.821
I don't fuck with
vikings, anyways.
