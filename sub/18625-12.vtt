-[chanting continues]

00:31.657 --> 00:34.243
[growling]

00:52.177 --> 00:54.972
Open the bridge!

00:55.055 --> 00:56.807
[laughs]

00:58.225 --> 01:00.185
It is my honor, Father.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.522
-Where is the young changeling?
-He should be here.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.568
Fragwa, take your brethren
and fetch that vile little beast.

01:09.236 --> 01:13.073
For centuries, Father,
we have awaited your glorious return.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.993
Tonight, we take back the surface lands.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.245
Tonight, we feast!

01:18.328 --> 01:20.163
-[all cheering]
-Waka chaka!

01:20.247 --> 01:22.583
[laughs]

01:34.386 --> 01:39.266
Finally... after centuries
of being in the Darklands...

01:42.894 --> 01:44.354
Something is wrong!

01:47.691 --> 01:50.444
Take out the amulet!
Take it out now!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.112
The portal is closing!

01:52.195 --> 01:53.196
[yells]

01:55.407 --> 01:56.783
-[roars]
-My son...

01:56.867 --> 01:59.786
-Father!
-My son, what have you done?

02:01.913 --> 02:02.831
Father!

02:07.419 --> 02:10.797
"Daylight is <i>his</i> to command." Bular!

02:10.881 --> 02:12.674
You said the amulet would open the bridge!

02:12.758 --> 02:15.052
-Bular, I know what we need.
-What?

02:15.135 --> 02:20.432
The Trollhunter. The amulet won't work
without him. He is the key.

02:20.515 --> 02:24.019
-Bring the Trollhunter to me!
-It will be my pleasure.

02:25.270 --> 02:30.192
Pray that you're right, impure,
or Arcadia will burn in my fury.

02:30.275 --> 02:35.155
He still has the fake amulet.
Nothing will protect him now.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.398
-Let's see, what have we got here? Ooh!
-[mobile playing soft music]

03:09.481 --> 03:13.276
Got some argyle, polka-dots,
extra-long tube, and these--

03:13.360 --> 03:18.031
Oh, now, these have never been washed.
It practically stands up on its own.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.950
[sniffs, gags]

03:20.033 --> 03:23.537
We're talking months of toe sweat
and-- [gags] gym classes.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.038
Whoa! Stop the trolley!

03:25.122 --> 03:28.708
You want me to crawl through the Fetch,
into the Darklands,

03:28.792 --> 03:30.669
and rescue Claire's baby brother

03:30.752 --> 03:35.173
for a few pairs of smelly, stinky,
never been washed--

03:35.257 --> 03:38.135
Oh, come on! You know the Darklands.
You can rescue him!

03:38.218 --> 03:42.389
No! No amount of socks
will get me back into that freak show.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.807
-[man] <i> Good night, Sam!</i>
<i>-See you tomorrow!</i>

03:43.890 --> 03:46.518
-[man] <i> All right.</i>
-I'm tellin' you, Suzy Snooze,

03:46.601 --> 03:50.897
give 'em an inch,
and they want the whole Sunday roast.

03:50.981 --> 03:55.694
Sweat sock edition! [chuckles]
Plaid is back in season.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.320
-[rapid footsteps]
-Huh?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.323

04:03.618 --> 04:05.287
[creature growls]

04:06.413 --> 04:10.625
Fragwa, to what do I owe this pleasure?

04:10.709 --> 04:14.880
[speaking goblin language]

04:14.963 --> 04:17.798
You know I don't understand
that "waka" stuff.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.134
Waka chaka!

04:19.216 --> 04:21.970
Oh, Strickler sent you
to come and get me, eh?

04:22.053 --> 04:25.182
Well, who says I want to go?
Maybe I'm startin' to like it here.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.850
[growling]

04:26.933 --> 04:30.979
You insist? Right, then.
You don't want to see this, Suzy.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.064
Sweat sock edition?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.649
-[grunts]
-[groans]

04:34.733 --> 04:38.904
Sorry to disappoint,
but this baby ain't goin' quietly.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.199
[snarls, yells]

04:42.282 --> 04:43.533

-[groans]

05:05.347 --> 05:06.890

05:06.973 --> 05:09.267
Definitely not childproof.

-[door opens]

[growls]

05:26.701 --> 05:29.579
[growling, yelling]

05:30.539 --> 05:32.749
Waka chaka!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.252
[others growling]

05:35.919 --> 05:37.546
[goblin laughs]

05:40.006 --> 05:42.801
Uh-oh, Suzy. Think I got sis in trouble.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.429
What good is this amulet
if it can't help me with this?

05:46.513 --> 05:49.432
Claire's brother is trapped
somewhere in the Darklands,

05:49.516 --> 05:51.017
and there's nothing I can do about it?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.562
Unfortunately, there is nothing
any one of us can do.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.854
What about the furgolator machine?

05:54.938 --> 05:57.941
-If I can shrink down, maybe--
-I mean, sure, we can go in all fun-size,

05:58.024 --> 06:01.027
but when it wears off and we become
full-size, we'll be stuck in there, too.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.946
And the Darklands
is a black labyrinth, Master Jim.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.783
Simply finding Baby Enrique would be
a nigh impossible task of its own.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.410
Gunmar.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.870
Aaarrrgghh is right. If any of us
were foolish enough to cross over,

06:10.954 --> 06:15.625
under no circumstances could you
be saved, at risk of freeing Gunmar.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.087
-But, what if--?
-Under no circumstances!

06:19.170 --> 06:24.801
Dude, don't be reckless! You almost just
lost a golden tuna roll! Sit down! Relax!

06:25.927 --> 06:29.139
What happened to the Trollhunter
answering every call?

06:29.222 --> 06:32.559
You have a strong heart, Master Jim,
a quality rarely seen in trolls.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.353
I believe, one day,
you will answer that child's call,

06:35.437 --> 06:37.606
but that day cannot be today.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.523
Hmm...

06:38.607 --> 06:42.652
[chattering imploringly]

06:42.736 --> 06:45.363
[chattering angrily]

06:45.614 --> 06:48.700
[chattering assertively]

06:48.783 --> 06:50.577
Chompsky, no! It's too much to ask.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.579
[chattering assertively]

06:58.168 --> 07:00.128
-[chattering]
-Be careful.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.838
It's dangerous in the Darklands.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.131
When you find Claire's brother,

07:03.214 --> 07:05.759
just give us a tug
and we'll get you back, okay?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.510
[chattering confidently]

07:07.594 --> 07:12.807
I have sorely misjudged you.
You are no vermin. You are a "ver-man."

07:12.891 --> 07:16.353
Wait! She has something to say.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.065
[moaning sadly]

07:20.148 --> 07:22.317
[chattering sadly, sighing]

07:22.400 --> 07:23.902
[moaning, kissing]

07:24.945 --> 07:29.032
[humming soft tune]

07:29.866 --> 07:32.452
[chattering assertively]

07:33.620 --> 07:35.121
[growling]

07:41.795 --> 07:42.712
[sighs]

07:42.796 --> 07:45.298
[dramatic music playing]

07:55.183 --> 07:56.685
All we can do is hope.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.563
Okay so far.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.777
-Oh! Hey! Hey, I just felt a tug!
-Quick! Pull him in!

08:06.444 --> 08:08.530
-[grunting]
-Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Grab it! Grab it!

08:08.613 --> 08:09.614
I am!

08:11.533 --> 08:12.534
[groaning]

08:12.617 --> 08:15.787
-Oh, no!
-[gasps] Chompsky! No!

08:15.870 --> 08:16.871
[Toby whimpers]

08:16.955 --> 08:19.416
-Oh, no.
-He's a scrappy creature, Tobias.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.211
If anyone can survive there, it's him.
Still want that furgolator now?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.592
-[tapping] Open up! Let me in!
-What's he doing here?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.138
A goblin came at me.
I made mincemeat out of him,

08:33.221 --> 08:35.849
but now, the rest of 'em
want their pound of flesh.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.601
I'm lucky to have escaped
with only a soiled diaper!

08:38.684 --> 08:42.438
You've drawn the ire of goblin vengeance
and have led them here!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
-Blinky, take it easy!
-Relax!

08:44.607 --> 08:47.193
They think the girl did it.
Now, they're after her.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.031
They think Claire's responsible?
They're gonna go after her!

08:51.114 --> 08:53.158
-I have to save her!
-[door opens]

08:53.241 --> 08:56.786
Ain't no one goin' after him?
Bular's got all the bridge pieces.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.497
[grunts] They've got every piece
of Killahead Bridge?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.208
And now, I hear all they need is the boy.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.002
We mustn't lose sight of Master Jim.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.338
Toby, Aaarrrgghh,
you protect the Trollhunter.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.510
-You are despicable.
-[grunts]

09:13.553 --> 09:15.013
What are you gonna do?

09:15.096 --> 09:19.517
By my six eyes,
I will find the bridge if it kills me.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.188
-And you are going to tell me where it is.
-[whimpering]

09:24.064 --> 09:28.902
[man grunts on TV]
<i>TÃº eres... mi amigo.</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:30.445
[music playing on TV]

09:30.528 --> 09:33.364
[dog barking in distance]

09:38.912 --> 09:40.330
-[sighs]
-[tapping] Claire!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.873
-[screams]
-Claire, open the window!

09:42.791 --> 09:44.167
What are you doing?

09:45.001 --> 09:48.713
-We gotta leave. They're coming for you.
-Who's coming? Why were you on my roof?

09:48.797 --> 09:51.382
I don't have time to explain.
You just have to trust me.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.177
-You're in danger.
-Don't touch me! I don't want you near me!

09:54.260 --> 09:57.222
Okay, how do I say this?
[inhales deeply]

09:57.305 --> 09:58.765
Your brother has been switched
with a changeling,

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
but now, goblins are after you
because of something he did,

10:00.809 --> 10:01.810
and now, I'm here to save you.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.522
I always suspected there was
something different about you.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.565
And now, I know. You're crazy!

10:07.649 --> 10:09.526
[sighs]
I know-- I know-- Look, I--

10:09.609 --> 10:12.612
Stop! I know it sounds insane,
but I can prove it to you.

10:14.572 --> 10:19.577
Okay... I'm the Trollhunter.
This amulet gives me mystical powers.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.871
-Seriously?
-Stand back.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.498
[takes deep breath]

10:23.581 --> 10:28.044
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.340
I'm glad I stood back.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.636
For the glory of Merlin...

10:36.719 --> 10:39.681
Oh, come on! Why isn't it working?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.560
-For the glory of Merlin--
-Shh! Keep your voice down!

10:43.643 --> 10:46.354
I'm not supposed to have boys
in my room, especially you!

10:46.437 --> 10:48.815
-[gasps] Oh, no!
-[rapid footsteps]

10:48.898 --> 10:52.110
-They're here!
-Those are raccoons, Jim.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.489
Your brother! They've taken
your brother! Check his crib!

10:56.573 --> 10:57.824
[grunts]

10:57.907 --> 10:58.825
[gasps]

11:00.535 --> 11:01.494
[gasps]

11:03.580 --> 11:06.374
[gasps]
Enrique! What did you do to my brother?

11:06.457 --> 11:10.086
Ow, ow! Claire, your brother isn't who
you think he is! He's been switched!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.462
-You aren't making any sense!
-Ow!

11:11.546 --> 11:15.425
He's at Toby's house! I mean--
I mean, the changeling is at Toby's house!

11:15.508 --> 11:17.218
[sighs]
You've got a strong right.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.637
-Where is my brother?
-Your real brother is in the Dark--

11:19.721 --> 11:21.222
[gasps]

11:24.309 --> 11:25.935
[snarling]

11:27.437 --> 11:28.271
[gasps]

11:28.897 --> 11:32.567
[grunts] If you want to find your brother,
you have to come with me, now!

11:35.194 --> 11:38.114
-What about my parents?
-They're not after your parents.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.784
[goblins yelling, snarling]

11:42.952 --> 11:46.331
-[growling]
-They're after you. The woods!

11:47.624 --> 11:50.209
[both panting]

11:51.336 --> 11:52.962
[grunting, panting]

11:55.089 --> 11:57.592
[snarling]

11:58.301 --> 12:01.596
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

12:01.679 --> 12:05.350
Stop it! Just stop it! You're scaring me!

12:05.433 --> 12:09.395
You and Strickler are into something deep,
something I-- I don't understand.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.814
I heard you. I heard you!

12:11.898 --> 12:14.734
And what was that in your basement?
I saw something.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.986
I'll explain everything
once I get you safe in Trollmarket.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.280
-Trollmarket?
-We have to keep moving, Claire.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.449
-If they catch us--
-[goblins snarling]

12:21.532 --> 12:23.451
[goblins]
Waka chaka...

12:23.534 --> 12:26.537
-Those aren't raccoons, are they?
-No.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.081
They're goblins.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.625
-Come on.
-[goblins yelling]

12:33.503 --> 12:35.630
There's Claire's house.
Hide, wingman, hide!

12:35.713 --> 12:36.673
Mm...

12:36.756 --> 12:38.675
-[panting]
-[doorbell ringing]

12:38.758 --> 12:42.178
[ringing repeatedly]

12:42.261 --> 12:44.889
-[ringing continues]
-Hm?

12:45.848 --> 12:49.686
[ringing continues]

12:51.229 --> 12:53.606
-[sighs]
-[Aaarrrgghh grunts]

12:56.985 --> 13:00.863
They're gone. I mean--
Hey, you're here! Mr. Nunez, what's up?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.992
You wouldn't happen to be interested
in a magazine subscription, would ya?

13:04.826 --> 13:06.828
[growls, grunts]

13:07.578 --> 13:08.997
[scoffs]
So rude.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.708
[goblins snarling]

13:11.791 --> 13:15.795
Oh, no! Come on! We have to find
Jim and Claire before the goblins do!

13:16.713 --> 13:17.797
[grunting, panting]

13:18.464 --> 13:20.174
[growling, snarling]

13:21.092 --> 13:22.844
[gasps, grunts]

13:22.927 --> 13:24.303
[both panting]

13:24.971 --> 13:26.305
-I'm scared, Jim.
-Shh!

13:26.389 --> 13:29.559
-I need to find a weapon.
-Tell me what's going on!

13:31.769 --> 13:33.896
[faint growling, rustling]

13:35.690 --> 13:38.526
Ooh... Chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka...

13:41.279 --> 13:42.780
-[snarls]
-[screams]

13:42.864 --> 13:44.073
[growling]

13:44.157 --> 13:45.700
-[snarling]
-Oh, Go...

13:45.783 --> 13:46.909
[growling, snarling]

13:48.161 --> 13:50.747
That... is not a raccoon!

13:50.830 --> 13:53.374
-Like I said, goblins.
-You were serious?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.501
-Huh?
-Stay close to me.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.088
[yelling]

14:01.007 --> 14:03.009
Goblins don't exist! They're not real!

14:03.092 --> 14:05.178
Claire, not the time. Whoa!

14:05.261 --> 14:08.264
-Don't worry, I got this.
-[snarling]

14:11.976 --> 14:13.561
-[growling]
-[yelps]

14:13.644 --> 14:15.772
Wow! You've got a great left, too!

14:16.731 --> 14:18.983
[grunts]
For the glory of Mer...

14:19.984 --> 14:22.528
Merlin. It's a fake.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.446
[grunts]

14:24.364 --> 14:29.327
[goblins snarling, yelling]

14:31.120 --> 14:31.954
Huh?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.791
[snarling]

14:34.874 --> 14:35.875
[screams]

14:35.958 --> 14:39.587
-[snarling]
-[grunting]

14:39.670 --> 14:40.546
[grunts]

14:40.630 --> 14:42.048
Uh, Claire?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.050
[goblins groaning]

14:44.133 --> 14:47.053
-[goblins yelling]
-[Claire whimpering]

14:47.136 --> 14:49.972
[goblins snarling]

14:50.056 --> 14:50.973
[gasps]

14:53.393 --> 14:57.146
For the glory of Merlin--
where are you?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.732
-That's strange. Why is it--?
-[gasps]

14:59.816 --> 15:01.275
[grunts, screams]

15:04.612 --> 15:05.446
[grunts]

15:05.905 --> 15:06.739
[grunts]

15:10.743 --> 15:11.619
No!

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
[yelps, screams]

15:40.440 --> 15:42.108
[groans]
My other tooth!

15:44.569 --> 15:45.778
[screams]

15:47.280 --> 15:49.157
-Huh?
-[yelps]

15:49.240 --> 15:51.742
-Whoa. Thanks, wingman, that was--
-Weird.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.912
Come on, man! If it's a weird thing,
then it's a troll thing. After it!

15:54.996 --> 15:57.081
-[snarling]
-Waka chaka...

15:57.165 --> 15:58.416
[grunts]

15:58.499 --> 16:00.626
-[snarling]
-[grunting]

16:04.338 --> 16:05.381
[grunting]

16:06.799 --> 16:10.636
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

16:19.770 --> 16:20.730
[goblins snarling]

16:25.943 --> 16:26.986
[snarling continues]

16:27.069 --> 16:28.863
-Get down!
-[screams]

16:29.071 --> 16:30.406
[grunting]

16:35.328 --> 16:38.039
[grunting]

16:40.500 --> 16:41.959
[grunting continues]

16:43.336 --> 16:46.631
-[breathing heavily]
-[goblin whimpering]

16:49.091 --> 16:51.135
What the--? How the--?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.804
Yeah. That cool thing
I wanted to show you? This is it.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.933
This? This is...

16:57.016 --> 16:59.560
-Wow.
-Pretty much. [chuckles]

17:03.564 --> 17:06.817
-This was never a costume.
-[chuckles]

17:07.777 --> 17:09.444
[gasps, growls]

17:14.032 --> 17:15.617
Ugh, I hate those things.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.788
These things took my brother?
Do you know where he is?

17:18.871 --> 17:23.376
Yes... and no. It's complicated.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.755
The monsters... in your letter!
They were real monsters!

17:27.838 --> 17:32.426
No, not monsters. Trolls.
And some of them are my friends.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.928
-[hyperventilating]
-Breathe.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.555
-This is--
-Take a breath.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.390
-Don't tell me to--
-Claire...

17:37.473 --> 17:39.433
[takes deep breath]

17:39.517 --> 17:41.102
I should've believed you.

17:41.185 --> 17:45.022
Why does something that makes no sense
make so much sense now?

17:45.106 --> 17:48.234
When you destroyed my house,
when you missed so many rehearsals--

17:48.317 --> 17:50.486
You wore that knight suit to tryouts!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.614
Ugh! Like, being in a stupid play
is suddenly some high priority.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.784
No, it is! The play must go on!

17:56.867 --> 17:59.954
We have to make it look
like everything is normal.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.747
If people knew...

18:01.831 --> 18:05.459
I'm-I'm sorry, Claire,
but you can't tell anyone about this.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.753
Not your friends, not your parents.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.714
What am I supposed
to tell my parents about Enrique?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.174
That-That he's a change-thing?

18:12.258 --> 18:13.926
I don't even know what that is!

18:14.010 --> 18:16.929
[sighs]
Am I ever going to see my brother again?

18:18.014 --> 18:21.017
Like I said, it's... it's complicated.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.936
But I can assure you, he is safe.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.732
Who else knows? Toby? Strickler...

18:27.815 --> 18:31.027
I'll explain everything later.
You've been through a lot.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.820
-But right now, we have to--
-[hissing]

18:32.903 --> 18:34.488
[whistling haunting melody]

18:34.572 --> 18:41.287
[whistling continues]

18:41.370 --> 18:44.582
You need to run.
Run home and don't look back.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.125
I'm not leaving!

18:47.084 --> 18:48.878
Who's whistling?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.547
[whistling continues]

19:00.723 --> 19:02.558
How cute.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.601
[chuckles]

19:03.684 --> 19:06.604
And they say chivalry is dead.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.397
[yells, grunts]

19:13.486 --> 19:15.071
Run, Claire!

19:23.537 --> 19:25.706
[snarling, laughing]

19:26.999 --> 19:30.920
Let's see how you handle yourself, boy.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.964
-Hi-yah!
-[grunts]

19:34.048 --> 19:36.300
[both grunting]

19:39.428 --> 19:40.262
[screams]

19:41.138 --> 19:46.185
Impressive. How you've grown.
I'll cut you down to size.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.481
-[yelling]
-[laughs]

19:50.564 --> 19:52.149
[both grunting]

19:52.233 --> 19:53.818
[grunts, panting]

19:53.901 --> 19:55.403
[hissing]

19:55.486 --> 19:57.279
Mom! Dad!

19:58.114 --> 20:00.199
-Claire, what's wrong?
-It's Jim!

20:02.952 --> 20:04.120
-[Jim yells]
-Huh?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
What was that?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.623
-[panting]
-[hissing]

20:07.707 --> 20:09.333
-[screams]
-Hi-yah!

20:09.417 --> 20:12.420
-[panting]
-[yelling, grunting]

20:13.003 --> 20:14.505
-[yelling]
-[grunting]

20:14.588 --> 20:16.382
[both grunting]

20:16.465 --> 20:18.342
-[yelling]
-Hi-yah!

20:18.426 --> 20:21.011
-[grunting, panting]
-[chuckles]

20:22.263 --> 20:24.140
-Hi-yah!
-[gasps, screams]

20:24.223 --> 20:25.224
[groans]

20:25.307 --> 20:26.976
[panting]

20:29.854 --> 20:30.938
[groans]

20:31.021 --> 20:34.358
-The other amulet--
-A fake! Just like you.

20:34.442 --> 20:40.489
A human Trollhunter? [chuckles]
That must've broken Draal's heart.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.283
You had the real one.

20:42.366 --> 20:47.413
We tried to open the bridge,
but, apparently, it needs you to do it.

20:47.496 --> 20:52.877
-So, why are you trying to kill me?
-Not kill. Take.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.051
-[Claire] This way!
-[hissing]

21:02.636 --> 21:04.472
-Huh?
-[Toby] Jim!

21:05.765 --> 21:06.849
Jim!

21:10.186 --> 21:11.520
[growls]

21:12.146 --> 21:14.774
[Claire]
Hurry! He's over here.

21:16.734 --> 21:17.902
Jim...

21:21.489 --> 21:22.698
[Aaarrrgghh growling]

21:22.782 --> 21:24.867
You-- You gotta stay here, wingman.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.076
[whimpers]

21:26.160 --> 21:28.329
Jim, do you hear me?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.498
Dad-- Dad, call an ambulance!

21:33.167 --> 21:34.418
[Toby]
Jim!

21:39.006 --> 21:41.091
-[people breathing heavily]
-[woman on PA] <i>Dr. Johnson...</i>

21:41.175 --> 21:45.888
Hold on, sweetie. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine, I promise.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.973
Jim, hold on.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.730
Great Gronka Morka,
the changeling was right!

21:54.814 --> 21:58.317
The bridge is complete,
and it was here the whole time!

21:59.610 --> 22:01.362
-Oh, dear...
-[growls]

22:01.695 --> 22:03.280
-[grunts]
-[yelps]

22:05.449 --> 22:11.080
If Young Atlas won't open it for us,
maybe he'll open it for you.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.873
[laughs]

22:13.624 --> 22:14.458
Oh...
