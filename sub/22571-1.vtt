WEBVTT

00:05.073 --> 00:06.140
- Chillin'.
- Oh, my God,

00:06.240 --> 00:07.575
look at this setup.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.244
- Hey.
- Ivy, scoot over.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.581
You small, but you
ain't that small.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.216
- Yeah, this is the ticket.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.850
- You got to put your
feet up like this.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.918
Want to test it out
by yourself?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.053
- Yeah, I do.
- All right.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.588
Don't get too comfortable,

00:20.688 --> 00:22.390
because this seat
is not for sale.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.791
- Okay.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.359
= Close your eyes
and get comfy.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.363
- One less buyer
to worry about.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.265
- Ivy, get me out of here!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.337
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:36.437 --> 00:38.706
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.208
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:40.308 --> 00:42.210
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.544
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.878
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:44.978 --> 00:46.580
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:46.680 --> 00:48.116
- You shut your face.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.284
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.452
- We're back, baby!

00:55.456 --> 00:56.657
- Today's gonna be exciting.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.292
We're in canyon country, Danny.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.429
- What's the difference between,
like, a canyon and a valley?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.964
- Canyons are hilly
and valleys are flat.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.101
This is a valley here
surrounded by canyons.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.637
- That doesn't even
make sense.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.706
- Canyon country just sounds
like very rural

01:12.806 --> 01:14.242
and a lot of critters.

01:14.342 --> 01:15.643
- "Coming soon: bail bonds."

01:15.743 --> 01:16.944
That's how you know it's classy,

01:17.044 --> 01:17.945
when they have a lot
of bail bonds places.

01:18.045 --> 01:18.946
- Ooh, that's a distraction.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.414
- Liquor store, bail bonds.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.916
Weed maps.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.084
- Come on, let's go!

01:24.185 --> 01:25.085
- Ivy!

01:28.722 --> 01:31.392
Freakin' Ivy.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.762
Uh-oh, Nevada.

01:34.862 --> 01:35.929
I hope somebody
come from Nevada,

01:36.029 --> 01:37.765
they got a unit here,
or they...

01:37.865 --> 01:38.932
gonna buy units.

01:39.032 --> 01:39.933
- Probably renting
a unit here.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.436
Think with a Range Rover,
you'd be able to buy

01:42.536 --> 01:44.372
a storage unit
or a garage.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.006
- So what--
who are these girls?

01:46.106 --> 01:49.610
- I don't know.
What's with the jean vests?

01:49.710 --> 01:50.911
Did they roll up on their Hogs?

01:51.011 --> 01:51.979
Yeah.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.881
- Got some new buyers in town.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.149
I see you ladies here. Hi.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.284
Laura Dotson.
How are you?

01:56.384 --> 01:57.685
- Shana.
- Shana, nice to meet you.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.420
- Hi, Edwina.
- Hi, Edwina, nice to meet you.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.622
- We're both bosses.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.326
- No. We're happily married.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.060
To different...

02:07.161 --> 02:08.262
- Dan, you got to stop.
- To men, to men.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.830
- I'm sorry.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.600
- We're both coming from Vegas.
We just drove out here.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.702
- Northern California,
they got the best units.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.304
Over here... you should try
northern California.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.107
He's psyching us out.
He knows the good stuff is here.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.609
- Don't listen.
- That's why you're here.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.810
- I just don't want you to make
a trip all the way out here

02:22.910 --> 02:24.111
for nothing.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.145
- Have you guys been
to this one before?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.380
- Not me.
- You just told us

02:26.480 --> 02:28.416
that there ain't nothing here.
- Yes.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.783
- That means you've
been here before.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.685
- I meant there's nothing here
for you two.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.654
- Oh, snap!

02:33.754 --> 02:35.155
- Man, I hate new buyers.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.124
What comes from Vegas
should stay in Vegas.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.226
Shoot.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.860
Oh, just in case...

02:39.960 --> 02:42.996
- Nobody told you--not being
uppity or anything--

02:43.096 --> 02:44.898
but out here, they call me
the king.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.300
- Oh, boy. I can't.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.370
- I mean it.
- I'm done with you.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.838
- Not to be uppity
or anything.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.373
- If nobody tells you,
you just don't know, right?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.107
- All right, welcome
to Private Mini Storage.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.876
Before you go through
these gates,

02:55.976 --> 02:57.511
you need to know how it works.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.979
You're gonna go to the unit,
we're gonna remove the locks,

02:59.079 --> 03:00.381
gonna give you five minutes
to take a look around.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.916
You can't go inside.
You can't open any boxes.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.385
And who's ever got the most
money in their pocket

03:04.485 --> 03:05.653
can own it today.
Are you ready?!

03:05.753 --> 03:07.821
- Yeah!

03:07.921 --> 03:09.457
- Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

03:09.557 --> 03:11.392
- All right, boss!

03:11.492 --> 03:14.027
- Here we go, unit for y'all!

03:14.127 --> 03:15.529
Whoo-hoo!

03:15.629 --> 03:17.130
Folks, this is
kind of an L shape.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.632
You kinda got to bend your neck
to look back

03:18.732 --> 03:20.468
at all those motorcycle parts.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.670
*

03:22.770 --> 03:25.138
- This is, uh, right up
your alley, buddy.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.040
- Right up my alley.
- Get out of the unit.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.376
- Uh-uh, he's in the unit,
you see him?

03:28.476 --> 03:29.577
He trying to be slick.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.211
He trying to be slick.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.346
- All right, go ahead and look.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.714
- Ah, yes you can.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.483
- Yeah, everybody can put
one foot in like that

03:35.583 --> 03:37.751
and lean in.
I'm gonna allow it, all right?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.787
- They're too tall. It's unfair.
- There you go!

03:39.887 --> 03:41.154
- Oh, my God, look at that coat.
- Teamwork.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.990
It's like hung up all nicely.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.625
That's for a crotch rocket,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.427
uh, bike, the ones that
you lean over.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.596
- This is a man's unit
for sure.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.564
Some bike parts, some tennies,

03:50.664 --> 03:52.433
all sorts of stuff for guys.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.134
- Some little shoes in there.
Are we sure that was a man?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.135
Look at those little feet.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.739
- Oh, well, that's why
he had a big bike.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.843
- Got some Kawasaki parts.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.645
Be nice if it was Harley.
Harley sells for more.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.847
This stuff will sell,
but not as high.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.882
Those fairings right there
are about 700 bucks

04:08.982 --> 04:10.284
if you got to order them
for your bike.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.622
I got 2500.
50?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.757
25, 50, 50 bucks.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.991
75 now.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.293
I got 50.
75, ladies?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.396
100 bucks, 125.
- Yup.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.098
150, 175...

04:26.834 --> 04:27.735
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.106
225!

04:33.206 --> 04:36.143
- Tell him!

04:36.243 --> 04:38.946
- 325, 350 and 75...

04:39.046 --> 04:40.113
I got 350 there.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.415
375 where?
I got 350.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.451
375, 375...

04:43.551 --> 04:44.752
375 going once.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.587
350, 375 going twice.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.491
- What the...

04:50.591 --> 04:51.659
400 bucks?

04:51.759 --> 04:53.293
Ladies, right on.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.262
- I feel like they might want it
more than I do.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.600
I got 400 bucks.
425 going once.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.234
Shaking your head no.
425 going twice.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.970
$425?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.939
Sold it your way, Jarrod.
$400 even, 400.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.375
- We got a unit
with motorcycle parts.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.009
- Maybe one of the Vegas broads
will let me

05:09.109 --> 05:10.344
borrow one of their vests.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.912
- All right, let's see
what's in here.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.381
This is a weird unit.
- I know.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.815
Look at this helmet.
helmet.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.016
- Yeah, that's a nice helmet.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.585
- Somebody put these
stupid stickers on it,

05:17.685 --> 05:18.819
but...
- That's okay.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.153
- We'll still get 50 bucks for
this helmet.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.423
I wonder what
these parts are worth.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.724
That looks like the dash.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.258
I don't know if it's still
worth something.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.628
A lot of these, these look like
street bike exhausts.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.662
- Some are used.
- Let's take them somewhere

05:28.762 --> 05:29.930
to get them checked out.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.366
- Some are new.
- Here's a tattoo kit.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.701
- Ooh, that's worth something.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.404
Two motors, grips, everything
you need right here.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.572
Probably a couple hundred bucks.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.941
*

05:41.041 --> 05:42.376
That could be a Rolex.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.482
You think fake or real?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.283
- Well...
- I think that might be real.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.652
- Yeah, I think that
might be real.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.086
- Look at the back.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.790
A lot of the knockoff watches
have a sticker on here

05:56.890 --> 05:58.626
or some  number,
some people trying to make it

05:58.726 --> 05:59.760
look authentic.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.761
This one, they didn't
change anything,

06:00.861 --> 06:01.995
so based on my experience,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.432
this is definitely
a real Rolex face.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.967
And we would get at least
1,500 bucks for it.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.169
*

06:09.269 --> 06:10.471
- More motorcycle parts.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.473
Let's get back to this auction

06:12.573 --> 06:13.474
and then we'll come back

06:13.574 --> 06:14.542
and grab the parts after.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.910
- That sounds great.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.278
- Come on, here we go.
Get a good look.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.980
Do it, do it.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.482
- Ohhh.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.283
*

06:23.383 --> 06:24.785
- You guys gonna get
your feet wet or what?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.219
- You all up in the Kool-Aid.
- All up in our business.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.355
- All up in it.
- Just trying to help.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.757
Trying to help.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.091
- Who do you think you are,
our storage daddy?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.325
- Uh, we might be new.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.794
But we know what
we're doing.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.596
- This is, you know, a thrift
store kind of unit.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.130
Everything, everything sells
in a thrift store,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.265
and that's what this room has.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.100
It's a real nice room.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.702
- Oh, look at that case.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.136
That's like a...

06:43.236 --> 06:44.605
- Those, uh, those traveling,
you know,

06:44.705 --> 06:45.873
like those concerts and stuff/

06:45.973 --> 06:47.274
- Yeah, that's nothing.
That's nothing at all.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.009
- No, no.
I know, right?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.945
- Get over here.
I got to talk to you one sec.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.781
- A lot of potential
treasures in there.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.349
Depends on how much it goes for,
and I think those two

06:56.450 --> 06:58.986
new ladies over there,
they're all about it.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.253
- 8 x 12, folks.
- 8 x 12.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.421
- Big unit, here we go.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.590
- 500, Dan.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.124
- 500 there.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.560
I got 600.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.995
- 650.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.100
- 750.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.440
I've got 900 bucks. 950?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.542
975 to you.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.613
- 1,000, 1,025...

07:25.713 --> 07:26.914
1,050, 1,075...

07:27.014 --> 07:28.782
ladies, 1,075 where?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.618
- We want in.
- 1,100 now.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.052
I got 1,075. 1,100?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.787
1,100 where?
Shaking his head no.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.055
1,100 going once,
1,100 going twice.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.125
Welcome to California, ladies.
$1,075!

07:38.225 --> 07:40.293
- Oh, my God.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.395
Our first locker in LA

07:42.496 --> 07:45.265
- Well, hopefully these Cali
lockers live up to the hype.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.634
*

07:46.734 --> 07:49.703
- 16 x 12, folks.
Get a good look.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.239
*

07:52.339 --> 07:53.707
- That lamp up there,
that's dope.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.142
- All the clothes
in here, though?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.343
These are designer jeans.

07:56.443 --> 07:57.444
- Exactly.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.046
- This is good stuff, actually.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.480
And look at all
the wrapped vases.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.449
- 200 boxes.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.251
Minimum 10 bucks apiece.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.485
2,000 bucks.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.688
- This is huge.
- It's huge.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.723
I could take, like, three days
to get this stuff out.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.725
- There's a nice, giant
black widow up there.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.026
Oh, my God.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.829
And it's a black widow!

08:15.929 --> 08:17.631
Instant death right there.
- Yeah.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.199
I am out and a half.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.834
- They used to call Brandi
the Black Widow.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.803
- Give it time, baby.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.539
Do you see it?
- Oh, my God.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.207
I don't--I don't like spiders.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.943
One black widow in my life
is enough for me.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.712
- Don't do it, Dan!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:33.146 --> 08:34.882
- No!

08:34.982 --> 08:37.350
- Don't do it! Don't--

08:37.450 --> 08:39.286
- Oh, my God.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.954
Arghhhh!

08:41.054 --> 08:42.823
- Dead.
- Don't put that back in there.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.091
- Oh, it's in there.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
- Y'all act like y'all
killed a T-rex.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.928
- All right!

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
500...

08:50.030 --> 08:52.032
$100 bill, $100 for ya.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.033
$100 where?
I'm gonna give you a week.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.736
- That's a deal.
- He's gonna give you a week.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.270
100 bucks, 150...

08:57.370 --> 08:59.006
going twice, all in.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.073
Got to go against what?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.442
You bought it for
a $100 bill.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.844
- Thank you.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.846
- Ooh!
!

09:05.946 --> 09:07.314
On the low

09:07.414 --> 09:08.481
- I love anything that
makes a locker cheaper.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.717
Even spiders.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.620
And now my Spidey sense
is tingling.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.655
- Good, olden treasures.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.690
Come on now. Whoo!

09:16.790 --> 09:18.726
*

09:18.826 --> 09:20.193
- The stainless steel
refrigerator,

09:20.293 --> 09:21.595
300 bucks right there.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.530
So no matter what, I'm in
for at least 300 bucks.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.699
How much money where?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.434
- 100 bucks.
- 600.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.903
- 650.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.339
- Sold it your way, Ivy.
$700, Ivy.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.642
- That's it.
- Come on, man.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.776
- Folks, get a good look.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.646
*

09:38.746 --> 09:40.547
- That looks like a nice
motorcycle bag right there.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.915
I'd love to know
what's in that.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.487
Anyone give me $1 for this unit?
'Cause we want to sell it.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.624
Sold it your way, Ivy. $1.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.192
- I'm getting it in quarters.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.561
- Ivy, yeah!
- See, we can't sleep on him.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.229
He's bidding, and I don't even
know he's bidding!

09:56.329 --> 09:58.666
- I hope everybody learned
an important lesson today.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.500
Never underestimate the king.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.601
- Thank you, folks.
That's the end of selling.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.170
Don't forget to pay the lady.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.273
- Nothing that caught my eye.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.641
These offers had
the right stuff,

10:07.741 --> 10:09.376
but they also had spiders.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.811
No thanks.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.079
- All right, maybe next time.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.180
- Yeah, next time.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.548
*

10:15.649 --> 10:18.118
- Lucky 222.
I'm kind of excited.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.552
We bought this locker because
it's full

10:19.653 --> 10:21.121
of everything we're
looking for:

10:21.221 --> 10:22.622
new vintage.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.424
- You know, the stuff that's
just now coming back into style.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.027
- Oh, my gosh, these sinks--
amazing.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.395
- That'd be 200 bucks.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.496
- Maybe this is like
a camera or something.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.567
It's a Samsung!
Vintage.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.736
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.905
an Icon and a Samsung.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.039
- 200 bucks.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.340
This bench.
- Oh, this bench.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.775
- If we painted this and I
get creative--

10:41.875 --> 10:42.943
- If we distressed it--

10:43.043 --> 10:44.745
- Yeah, I could probably
sell it for 345.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.014
- Easy.
This is the DIY we need.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.216
Oh, my God, all these tools.
Miscellaneous tools

10:49.316 --> 10:50.417
like this old tool bin...

10:50.517 --> 10:57.991
- 50 bucks.
Oh, my goodness. Edwina.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.693
- I don't know!

10:59.793 --> 11:01.729
I need your help.
It's so heavy.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.731
Watch your back.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.098
*

11:05.198 --> 11:06.599
What the crap?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.568
- Damn, it is heavy.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.804
- "Pull handle down once,
let go."

11:10.904 --> 11:12.205
- I'd love to see
how old this is.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.206
Oh, look, there's a date.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.643
both: 1924! What?!

11:16.744 --> 11:18.445
- Oh, my God, this is
where we shine.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.882
When people see unwanted,
we see... must-have.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.084
Take out this.
- This feels like clothes.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.254
Let's see.
Shana, look at this.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.022
This is like a collectible!

11:29.122 --> 11:31.091
- Maybe she was into fire.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.326
This is weird.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.428
"Buddy L Quality Toys."

11:35.528 --> 11:37.564
Look how they spelled Illinois
with two L's.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.532
- Oh, yes.
- I think these two go together.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.034
I'ma put them together.
- Okay.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.635
- Okay, this is something we'll
have to get checked out.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.372
Oh, my gosh, is this
the whole kit, the fire kit?!

11:45.472 --> 11:47.875
"Elkhart Brass, MFG Co."

11:47.975 --> 11:49.276
Manufacturer, Elkhart.
- For fire.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.344
- This is a shabby chic
dream home.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.080
- Yes.
- Girl, we are on fire.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.514
Get it?!

11:54.614 --> 11:56.917
- I said it; I get it.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.019
- Pieces of, like, granite
and stuff.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.320
- We know people use this.
- Yes.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.855
- Yes, and they make tiles and--
- Wow.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.323
- See, and look at.
- Okay.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.692
- Look at, right now we just
made our own tiles right now.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.194
This chair for 50 bucks.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.196
- We thought it was trash.
- But it is not.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.597
- We found something
to do with it.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.565
- And down.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.967
*

12:14.067 --> 12:15.402
Hey, what the hell?

12:15.502 --> 12:18.071
What the hell is this?
- I don't know.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.440
The case alone is, like,
what, 200 bucks?

12:20.540 --> 12:21.608
- At least.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.076
Oh, my gosh, it's vintage.
- It is.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.012
- It's home movies that nobody
wants people to see.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.847
These are fun. People still
collect these, though.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.615
- I know, I know.
- This right here is 10 bucks.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.283
- I think this might be a stove.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.252
Like an outdoor stove.
It's a Coleman.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.720
- Yeah. Yes.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.589
It is a Coleman stove!
- It's a stove.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.325
I would sell it, like,
as a décor piece.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.459
- Done. 150.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.594
- Edwina, look at these
dressers.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.164
- My gosh, they're so cute.
60 bucks each.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.733
- Okay, okay, yeah.
This piece right here...

12:46.834 --> 12:49.036
- I'd say 80 bucks.
- Yeah.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.172
Oh, it's a Shake Weight.
I can't wait to get fit.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.374
- I'm pretty sure she had
a strong arm.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.809
All right, look...
- Okay.

12:55.909 --> 12:56.810
- So we looked through
everything.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.145
Let's wrap this stuff up.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.312
We got to get this stuff
checked out though, girl.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.613
- I'm excited, yeah.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.082
- That fire stuff looks
like the truth.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.354
*

13:07.454 --> 13:09.422
All right, Pops,
set it right here,

13:09.522 --> 13:11.191
I bought three lockers,
packed them up,

13:11.291 --> 13:12.592
and brought them to my store.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.661
Ivy Jr.'s gonna do
the heavy lifting.

13:14.761 --> 13:15.963
What elsare kids good for?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.865
- Recliner chair.
- $60.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.300
- TV, all nice, wrapped up.
- 120 bucks.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.435
Well, pool table
coming together.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.304
Pool table, pool table.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.906
- Two beds and a table.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.274
Oh, this is part
of the pool table.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.909
- Yep, put your pool sticks
in there.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.277
Ooh, these are nice bats.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.179
$40 here, $20 here.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.546
$15 here.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.647
Adding up.
- Right on.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.349
Catch!

13:36.449 --> 13:38.585
- Ooh. Dollar if I
hit that trash can?

13:38.685 --> 13:39.719
- All right, I'll bet you.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.388
*

13:41.488 --> 13:43.390
Uh! Whoo!

13:43.490 --> 13:44.791
- Okay, I'll give you
a dollar.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.193
- Ivy wins a dollar.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.328
Hey, that was the price
of my last locker.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.496
Thanks, son.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.497
- You got the big part
of a drum.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.498
- Oh, yeah.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.334
Little top, yep.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.237
- There're the balls.
- Yes. Ooh, they're nice, too.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.139
You know what, I'd get about
$40 just for those.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.340
- Nice little workbench.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.475
- Put the tools up there.
Work right here.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.977
I could make 150 bucks.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.178
Pops, this would
look good on you.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.613
You got that style.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.948
- That style.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.017
- Looks like 50 bucks.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.519
- Ooh, it's a little small.
This is a little kid hat.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.921
- That is small.
- Mm-hmm.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.389
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.991
Want to have a crystal
.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.692
Give it a flick.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.631
Me-me-me, you-you-you...

14:24.731 --> 14:26.900
- Don't try to break it.
50 bucks.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.968
Ooh, you know what
they call those?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.169
Fixies.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.403
- Oh, 'cause they
only have one gear?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.872
- Yup. $125 in my pocket,
though.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.308
- Got a little TV.
- Oh, that's a thin sucker.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.177
I put this one at 150 easy.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.878
- Heck yeah.
Hey, this one's good.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.081
It has water and ice.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.216
*

14:43.316 --> 14:44.551
Fairly clean.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.154
- Oh, shoot, that's 250 bucks
right there.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.422
- Found the other cymbal.
- Sweet.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.259
That makes a set. $200,
every day of the week.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.027
Wait, this is the last one
we need for the pool table.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.762
How many are there?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.830
- There's a second one.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.466
Or the third one. Sweet.
- And a third one.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.035
- One, two, three, that's what
makes the pool table complete.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.004
- Heck yeah.
- That table went from trash

15:04.104 --> 15:05.338
to 400 bucks.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.240
And it's time to go home.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.708
- Heck yeah.
- It's dinnertime.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.110
- I'm with it.
- Let's go.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.212
Oh, wait a minute.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.446
You got to throw the trash
away first.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.881
Why do I
got to throw it away?

15:14.982 --> 15:18.351
*

15:18.451 --> 15:21.021
- We're meeting my buddy Mikey
over at Dirtbag Baggers

15:21.121 --> 15:23.656
so he can let us know what
our motorcycle parts are worth.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.959
Mike, what's up, man?

15:26.059 --> 15:29.162
- This guy can build, fix,
or customize anything.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.865
*

15:32.966 --> 15:35.135
All right, so, what do we have
here as far as parts?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.603
- We got a bike here that
you're looking at

15:36.703 --> 15:37.971
at a typical cruiser bike/

15:38.071 --> 15:39.539
You got almost all
your stuff right here.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.508
A little banged up, but it's
still valuable to somebody.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.278
You have outer fairing,
inner fairing right here.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.714
This is gonna go in
just like that.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.316
Complete that part.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.517
This is a back fender
right here.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.519
And this is a gas tank
right here.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.387
And then you have--

15:54.487 --> 15:56.323
you have your front fender,
still in decent shape.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.625
You know, some paint will make
this thing look brand new.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.693
This is a front fairing

16:00.793 --> 16:03.363
to a bike that's--
everyone learns off of.

16:03.463 --> 16:08.635
It's a Ninja 250.
- Okay.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.303
- Bucket of mufflers.
- Yeah.
- Bucket of mufflers.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.471
- That's what I call Jarrod.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.841
See what I got to deal with
all the time?

16:14.941 --> 16:18.011
Man, Jesus.
- Bucket of mufflers.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.446
People are pretty much
taking these things off

16:19.546 --> 16:21.248
and putting something to make
their bike louder.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.216
This is what quiets
their bike down.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.252
- Oh, that's the stock one.
- Yeah, this is stock stuff.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.954
*

16:28.055 --> 16:29.356
- Yeah!
- Junk.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.790
- All right, green bike, man,

16:30.890 --> 16:32.425
we got almost the whole thing
here, too.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.127
This bike right here
is a Kawasaki.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.762
People are always breaking
these parts.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.064
These fairings are real flimsy,

16:37.164 --> 16:38.931
so there's a higher market
in this stuff

16:39.032 --> 16:40.667
more than anything else.

16:40.767 --> 16:41.968
- All right, what do you think
we have for all of it?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.836
- So for the black parts
right here,

16:43.936 --> 16:45.905
you're looking about...

16:46.005 --> 16:47.707
200 bucks.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.876
For this outer fairing...

16:49.976 --> 16:51.644
about 50 bucks.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.347
And for the green parts...

16:54.447 --> 16:55.348
about 250.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.284
- Wow.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.818
That's gas money.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.653
*

17:00.753 --> 17:01.754
- Oh, my gosh, Shana,
look at this.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.156
- I know.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.457
- We are getting our
vintage fire stuff

17:04.557 --> 17:05.858
checked out by David Steinitz

17:05.958 --> 17:08.995
at the Los Angeles Fire
Department Historical Society

17:09.096 --> 17:10.863
Museum and Memorial.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.399
- That was a mouthful.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.801
- So let's see what you've
brought for us

17:14.901 --> 17:16.169
to take a look at.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.638
- Oh, my God.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.774
- Okay, well, um,
hopefully, uh...

17:21.874 --> 17:23.610
it's still worth the value.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.845
Oops.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.848
- This particular model is built
by a company called Buddy L.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.384
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
We saw it on the front there.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.520
- They made fire truck toys
for a long time.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.423
This unit's probably 1930s.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.191
These toys are rare

17:38.291 --> 17:39.959
because they were pre-war.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.894
A lot of them were
used to scrap.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.530
And you're very lucky
to have the bell onboard,

17:43.630 --> 17:45.298
because the bells are
usually missing.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.134
It also has steerable wheels.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.169
- Oh, I didn't see that.
So cool.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.403
- Which actually works.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
- I cannot wait to see
what you think

17:51.838 --> 17:52.772
of our other goodies
we brought.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.040
- Let's take a look.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.309
This is a soda acid
fire extinguisher.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.011
If you needed it, you would
turn it upside down.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.013
That mixed the chemicals,

18:01.114 --> 18:02.515
and then you would
fight the fire.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.551
This one feels like steel.
- Yeah.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.918
- It's not like it's a copper.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.820
So if this were cleaned up
or polished,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.623
it's not gonna come out looking
as sexy or as beautiful...

18:10.723 --> 18:12.225
Yeah, that's right.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.926
- As some of the ones
we have here.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.963
So this is a fire pull box.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.432
These were the way you called
for the fire department

18:19.532 --> 18:22.135
in the very, very early years
of this country.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.570
- And where would they
be found?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.305
Like on the street?
- This would be on a street.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.541
It would be on a corner within
a certain range of houses.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.944
The way this works is,
you pull this lever down,

18:32.044 --> 18:34.181
and a gearbox inside.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.883
Yay. You've got the guts.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.185
both: We have the guts!

18:38.285 --> 18:40.153
- This winds up.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.221
It still works?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.689
- What it's doing is,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.557
it's turning a little wheel
that has teeth on it.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.193
- Okay.
- And the teeth are broken off

18:46.293 --> 18:48.595
in such a way as to produce
a number.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.363
The wires that come out of this

18:50.463 --> 18:53.500
would go down into the street,
into a building

18:53.600 --> 18:55.468
that would have tape machines.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.304
So the operator
pulls the paper out

18:57.404 --> 18:58.371
and reads it.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.706
It goes over to a file,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.241
pulls out a card that
matches that number,

19:01.341 --> 19:03.710
and it says, "This box is
located at the corner

19:03.810 --> 19:05.245
of Cahuenga and Sunset."

19:05.345 --> 19:07.113
- Okay, David, what
is everything worth?

19:07.214 --> 19:09.081
- The pull box, which is
in really good shape--

19:09.182 --> 19:10.650
it's got the door,
it's got the glass,

19:10.750 --> 19:11.651
and it's got all the guts...

19:11.751 --> 19:13.586
- All right.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.089
- This is worth $175.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.558
both: Okay.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.293
- The fire extinguisher,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.395
because of its commonality,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.331
because it's a steel body,

19:24.431 --> 19:25.465
$50.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.666
- Okay.
- Not bad.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.435
- Now for the best
and last piece.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.836
- Yeah.
- Toy truck.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.671
An excellent example
of Buddy L product.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.340
It's in really good shape.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.874
This truck is easily worth...

19:34.974 --> 19:37.944
*

19:38.044 --> 19:39.579
$500.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.880
- That's amazing.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.249
- That's a lot more than
I think we thought.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.783
- It's saved by the bell.
- Yup.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.886
both: Us.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.256
- So here are some
of the fire extinguishers

19:49.356 --> 19:50.457
similar to what you have.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.225
- Oh, yes.
I love the brass.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.361
- But tell me about those balls.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.062
- These are called
fire grenades.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.265
They came in different styles,

19:58.365 --> 20:00.433
different colors,
different types of glass.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.501
Very collectible.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.035
- Dave, but your
balls are amazing.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.871
- They are amazing.
- Thank you for noticing.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.940
narrator: Jarrod and Brandi
crotch rocketed

20:08.040 --> 20:09.476
past the competition,

20:09.576 --> 20:12.979
throttling up a profit
of 1,850 bucks.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.415
- Edwina and Shana
went balls-out,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.550
making 1,100 big ones

20:17.650 --> 20:19.586
with their vintage
fire equipment.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.289
Ivy Calvin took home
three lockers

20:22.389 --> 20:24.457
and almost $1,000.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.793
And Mary Padian's locker dreams

20:26.893 --> 20:30.597
were washed out by
an itsy-bitsy spider.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.965
- Picture frame.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.501
- That's a big sucker.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.403
Want to make that thing
worth a lot?

20:36.503 --> 20:38.671
Bam.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.939
- So two bucks.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.641
- No, like 200.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.909
Or wait a minute.
Closeup.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.144
2,000.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.280
Look at this.
The "Mona Ivy."

20:47.380 --> 20:49.682
The eyes see you
wherever you go.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.621
- That'd be a ugly picture
to hang somewhere.
