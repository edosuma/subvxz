TOM SWIFT #104
"...And the Chocolate Cowboys"
Closed Captioned

00:01.418 --> 00:03.962
I'm Tom Swift.
Inventor, billionaire,

00:04.004 --> 00:06.047
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.299
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.218
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn

00:10.260 --> 00:11.886
I could earn his love.

00:11.928 --> 00:15.473
But his mission ended
tragically, or so I thought.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.642
Turns out it was sabotage.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.520
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

00:20.562 --> 00:22.897
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:22.939 --> 00:26.109
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.570
Now I have to find
the pieces of that capsule

00:28.611 --> 00:30.655
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.782
A global conspiracy called
"The Road Back"

00:32.824 --> 00:33.908
is standing in my way,

00:33.950 --> 00:35.452
so I can only trust my squad:

00:35.493 --> 00:38.246
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:38.288 --> 00:41.624
my adopted brother Lino,
and my A.I. Barclay.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.628
Together, we're going to find
my father and bring him home.

Mm. Traditionally,
that's done in a thong.

BARCLAY:
I attempted to triangulate
its location,

01:16.326 --> 01:19.204
but it appears the capsule's
copper alloy signal is fading.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.456
I can't refine the location
to less than five miles.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.084
Okay, so we need to find it
before it loses its signal.

Mm.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.311
Mm. The reaction is causing
a small vibration,

01:43.353 --> 01:44.771
but I will have that
sorted out

Scratched my hand,

10:12.695 --> 10:15.239

like a miracle.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.367
Cured a lot of
other people, too.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.289
It's tree sap.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.249

must have activated

Hmm. Tears from

10:39.597 --> 10:41.974
That's your cowboy plan

10:42.016 --> 10:45.186
Fine. How much
do you want for it?

10:45.227 --> 10:47.647

Hoo!

No, Michelle,

Okay, what happened to
doing what I say?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.194

And that was luck. Hey!

I'm talking to you.

A mission with my ex.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.956
The mission...

13:10.998 --> 13:14.126
ended our relationship.

The Road Back is planning,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.852

13:31.894 --> 13:34.814

hand-delivered.

Hey.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Incoming call from Tom Swift.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.898
Incoming call from Tom Swift.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.485
ISAAC:
Transmit. Copy? I'm coming in.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.321
Incoming call from Tom...

24:08.363 --> 24:10.031
ZENZI (over device):
I didn't mean to pry.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.242
TOM (on phone):
Isaac, Lino's in trouble.
I need backup.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.869
I'll call when
we're en route.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.330
Zenzi, come in.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.832
ZENZI:
This is all a misunderstanding.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.500
Sir, she was going through
your briefcase.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.960
ZENZI:
No, I wasn't.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.462
I was admiring the patina.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.838
On the inside of the bag?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.631
I just wanted to figure out
for myself

24:26.673 --> 24:28.425
about your taste in books.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.635
I mean, when you told me that
Native Son was your favorite,

24:30.677 --> 24:33.513
and what you said
about healing the nation,

24:33.555 --> 24:35.557
it just seemed a little
too good to be true.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.310
I-I'm not used to having dinner
with idealists.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.896
Richard Wright comes from my
mom's hometown in Mississippi.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.565
He writes with a conviction
that I recognize.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.150
Well, if you're into
Mississippi authors,

24:45.192 --> 24:47.027
then maybe you should try
Jesmyn Ward next time.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.404
I mean, she's not as
unrelentingly bleak.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.864
So shall we just
go back to dessert?

24:50.906 --> 24:53.033
She went in there alone.
She was looking for something.

24:53.074 --> 24:57.829
Okay, I was hiding something.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.956
I...

25:01.666 --> 25:04.252
I really like you.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.507
So you felt the need
to go through my belongings?

25:08.548 --> 25:10.050
(footsteps)

25:10.091 --> 25:12.969
Do you need
my assistance?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.387
ESKOL:
I haven't decided yet.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.892
Oh. But you need an entourage

25:18.934 --> 25:20.810
to help you figure it out?

25:27.234 --> 25:30.111
ZENZI:
Where did this man
even come from?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.446
Why do you need his help?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.490
WOMAN:
Help. Isaac. Help.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.951
Isaac. Help.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.748
(breathing unsteadily)
No...

25:41.790 --> 25:44.501
No, no, no.
Stay with me.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.544
Stay with me.
Don't go.

25:45.585 --> 25:48.338
Don't go.
(gasping)

25:48.713 --> 25:51.258
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.719
I'm right here.
(gasping)

25:54.761 --> 25:56.888
(sobs)

25:56.930 --> 25:58.390
Help!

26:00.016 --> 26:02.269
She needs you.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.105
All right.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.816
By the way,
menacing bodyguards

26:07.857 --> 26:09.901
aren't the best
first-date chaperones.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.487
(electricity powering down)

26:16.825 --> 26:19.995
(Isaac breathing unsteadily)

26:25.875 --> 26:28.044
Oh, this happens
from time to time.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.506
Tom's experiments go
on autopilot,

26:31.548 --> 26:34.050
and I've just learned how to
handle these things myself.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.011
So, if you'll follow me...

26:55.155 --> 26:56.781
Given that
the power is out,

26:56.823 --> 27:00.785
and I'm sure it's past these
friendly gentlemen's bedtime,

27:00.827 --> 27:02.287
you should go.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.042
Bring the car around, please.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.097
I'm sorry that our night
got cut short.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.308
Next time, I'll bring
fewer bodyguards

27:23.350 --> 27:24.684
and more desserts.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.562
Assuming there'll be
a next time.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.024
Safe travels, Nathan.

27:47.457 --> 27:50.085
Told you I could handle
a date.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.634
BARCLAY:
Welcome back to Oklahoma.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.885
Tom is on his way
up the tarmac.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.101
(electronic tones)
Oh, hey.

28:06.101 --> 28:10.063
Um, if you're done
giving me the silent treatment,

28:10.105 --> 28:11.648
I got some intel.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.608
Eskol may not have been
targeting the drone in Dallas,

28:13.650 --> 28:15.276
but he's clearly
up to something.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.154
Whatever you think you got

28:18.196 --> 28:19.989
wasn't worth dying for.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.075
I can't protect you

28:22.117 --> 28:25.412
if you don't take
your own life seriously.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.333
Everybody good?

28:30.375 --> 28:34.003
Cool. Let's get started.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.089
We're gonna go get Lino.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.008
♪ Beverly Hills straight
covered in grease ♪

28:39.050 --> 28:41.052
♪ I'm a lone cowboy
stuck in my jeans ♪

28:41.094 --> 28:42.971
♪ Drinking PBR,
got a couple in me ♪

28:43.012 --> 28:44.889
♪ Won't drive no truck
if it's way too clean ♪

28:44.931 --> 28:45.640
Yo!
(laughs)

28:45.640 --> 28:49.185
Whoa, whoa, you are early.
Oh, you gonna get your coat?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.396
Cowboys always on CPT?

28:51.438 --> 28:53.064
Dude, I'm fine.
Let him go.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.233
I wasn't gonna hurt the kid.
He's been killing us in bones

28:55.275 --> 28:56.317
since we grabbed him.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.986
Ah, so you admit
to kidnapping.

28:58.027 --> 29:01.281
I need the thing.
It's our ace in the hole.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.449
ZENZI:
How do you figure that?

29:02.490 --> 29:05.410
Just listen for a second.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.876
My family has been fighting
against land dispossession

29:12.917 --> 29:15.545
and predatory developers
for years.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.714
To protect our legacy.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.967
But if you take
that machine away,

29:21.009 --> 29:24.304
I lose my last chance
at building something

29:24.345 --> 29:26.306
that could carry forward
to my daughter

29:26.347 --> 29:27.640
and future generations.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.310
(vehicle approaching)

29:34.606 --> 29:36.608
Look, I just want
my brother back.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.361
Lino, come on.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.530
ZENZI:
Come on, honey.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.616
Lino, I said let's go!

29:54.959 --> 29:56.252
You think this is a game
you can use

29:56.294 --> 29:57.837
to run away from
your problems.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.090
But getting Dad back
is not a game.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.092
You should have talked to me

30:03.134 --> 30:06.387
instead of hiding away
in a luggage rack.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.097
But instead,
you endangered yourself

30:08.139 --> 30:11.768
and me and our mission because
you wanted to play tagalong.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.311
I tried talking to you,
but you kept

30:13.353 --> 30:14.771
blowing me of at the summit.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.648
I tried to help,
but I should have known

30:16.689 --> 30:18.107
it's Tom's way
or the highway.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.820
It's not my fault you
gave them the capsule piece.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.824
I didn't give it to them.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.909
BARCLAY:
We activated the portable
3-D printer

30:27.951 --> 30:31.913
on the Swift Enterprises jet
to fabricate a duplicate.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.346
You lied to them
to get what you want.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.307
Wow. You learn that at MIT?

30:51.349 --> 30:55.520
I did what I had to do
to keep you safe.

30:55.562 --> 31:00.149
Now let's get out of
this Black cowboy hell.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.901
Come on!

31:20.128 --> 31:22.297
What happened between
you and Lino?

31:22.338 --> 31:25.008
I checked him.
He needs to listen.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.928
But what if he was listening
to himself instead of you?

31:28.970 --> 31:33.182
Because it sounds like he had
his own ideas on how to help,

31:33.224 --> 31:35.101
and you went off on him
for not doing it

31:35.143 --> 31:36.269
the way you would have.

31:38.104 --> 31:41.316
Just like my father did
every day of my life.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.821
I promised myself I would never
be like my father, but...

31:46.863 --> 31:48.615
And how are you going
to do that?

31:48.656 --> 31:50.658
He's your dad.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.870
He's your model for manhood.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.997
I'm more like my dad
than I ever want to admit.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.000
So I have to become him?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.293
No.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.795
No, you can control
your choices,

32:02.837 --> 32:06.007
your action and your character.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.842
My father taught me that
being a man isn't about

32:07.884 --> 32:09.510
never making mistakes.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.722
It's about being vulnerable
enough to admit them,

32:12.764 --> 32:15.391
make amends and do better.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.101
Have you met Barton Swift?

32:17.143 --> 32:20.313
He never admitted
when he made a mistake.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.023
And it didn't matter
what I accomplished

32:22.065 --> 32:24.609
because he couldn't accept
the way that I did it.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.945
That's...

32:28.905 --> 32:32.116
That's not the type of man
I want to be.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.372
Then don't be.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.332
Do it different.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.850
I know Calvin kidnapped me,
or whatever...

32:57.892 --> 33:00.353
"Kidnapped me or whatever"?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.814
Look, hey.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.610
I'm sorry, man.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.612
I shouldn't have yelled
at you back there.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.947
Look... (chuckles wryly)

33:10.989 --> 33:14.075
I was acting like Dad.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.910
I should have let you
be brilliant in your own way

33:15.952 --> 33:19.706
instead of being mad at you
for not being me.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.418
What you did back there
was major.

33:23.459 --> 33:27.463
We couldn't have done
any of this without you.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.965
Hmm?

33:30.967 --> 33:34.679
One more thing.
Why'd you quit the fencing team?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.932
You killed it
at that last match.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.769
Um...

33:41.811 --> 33:44.814
all my teammates called me
a cheating freak.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.899
Cheating? Why?

33:46.941 --> 33:50.069
Because I beat them
12 times in a row.

33:50.111 --> 33:53.072
They said there was no way
someone like me could win.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.700
Oh...

33:55.742 --> 33:58.161
I get it.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.665
Like Venus, Serena,
and Tiger before you,

34:02.707 --> 34:05.001
you are kicking Black ass
in a white sport,

34:05.043 --> 34:08.755
and when you do that,
they're pressed. Okay?

34:08.796 --> 34:10.631
But why is the solution

34:10.673 --> 34:12.091
quitting something
that you love?

34:12.133 --> 34:16.637
Because what if they're
right, that I'm a freak?

34:16.679 --> 34:18.848
I felt something...

34:18.890 --> 34:22.977
strange that day.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.562
What if I'm dangerous,
like my mom,

34:24.604 --> 34:25.772
and you send me away?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.982
That... will never happen.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.192
You can't promise that.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.818
You just turned your
back on Calvin.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.653
No, that's-that's different.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.614
Look, he has nothing
to do with us.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.867
Why do you keep
defending him? Hmm?

34:39.702 --> 34:42.038
I envy him. Okay?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.083
I envy him and his daughter.

34:45.124 --> 34:48.419
They know who they are
and where they came from.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.546
I don't.

34:50.588 --> 34:54.675
They'll always have
a connection to their past.

34:54.717 --> 34:59.055
Well, until their, um,
town disappears.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.731
Barclay,

35:08.773 --> 35:10.233
turn the plane around.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.235
We're going back.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.197
(birds chirping)

35:16.239 --> 35:18.491
Look, I was wrong for giving
you all a fake machine.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.535
But I'm here
to make up for it.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.703
Better be the real one
this time.
(chuckles softly)

35:22.745 --> 35:24.080
You're thinking
too small.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.999
Now, one weeping tree
is cute,

35:27.041 --> 35:28.167
but you need
to make this place

35:28.209 --> 35:30.086
a healing and wellness
destination.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.879
Where people
spend a week,

35:31.921 --> 35:33.673
not just an hour.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.299
And I can make
that happen.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.261
Perpetual power packs.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.762
Working title.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.264
I modified them
to produce

35:41.305 --> 35:43.182
the same microvibrations
and radiation

35:43.224 --> 35:45.476
needed to make
an entire grove weep.

35:45.518 --> 35:46.894
(chuckles)

35:46.936 --> 35:48.896
And no one
will ever know

35:48.938 --> 35:51.107
they're the reason
the trees are weeping.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.068
And you're gonna sell
those tears in the gift shop

35:54.110 --> 35:55.903
of your wellness spa
and resort,

35:55.945 --> 36:00.324
whose construction and design
Swift Enterprises will fund.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.202
(chuckles)

36:03.244 --> 36:04.412
Thank you.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.915
What-what made you come back?

36:09.959 --> 36:12.545
I guess I finally figured out
what kind of cowboy

36:12.587 --> 36:14.672
I want to be.
(chuckles softly)

36:16.382 --> 36:17.550
(chuckling)

36:17.592 --> 36:19.010
Oh.

36:19.051 --> 36:22.054
And call me when you bring back
the Chocolate Cowboys.

36:22.096 --> 36:25.433
I've been looking for an excuse
to bust out my Dior chaps.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.809
(chuckles)
Ah.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.478
Is-is that anything
like Stacy Adams? Huh?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.314
Just like it.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.982
(laughter)

36:33.691 --> 36:35.276
Ah.
(chuckles)

36:35.318 --> 36:37.361
Mmm...

36:37.403 --> 36:38.446
Look, a spa.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.448
Look.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.201
(laughter)

36:49.415 --> 36:51.209
Are you okay?

36:54.003 --> 36:56.047
Just because she broke up
with you and things went wrong

36:56.088 --> 36:58.966
doesn't mean...
She didn't break up with me.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.473
I've been telling people
to keep it a buck.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.892
Guess I should
do the same.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.187
Her name was Marissa.

37:11.562 --> 37:15.274
Specialist Marissa Sanchez.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.904
I was her ghost.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.619
The mission went sideways. I...

37:26.661 --> 37:28.996
I got there too late.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.668
(shudders)

37:33.709 --> 37:36.045
And because I was too late...

37:37.255 --> 37:39.298
...she died.

37:41.300 --> 37:45.721
It's just easier to
say "she dumped me"

37:45.763 --> 37:49.225
than "I'm responsible
for her death."

37:49.267 --> 37:50.351
Isaac.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.353
I'm so sorry.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.563
I had no idea.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.941
If something had
happened to you,

37:56.983 --> 37:59.527
I would have never
forgiven myself.

37:59.568 --> 38:00.611
I made my own choices.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.780
That's not on you.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.700
You can't control
what the world does to people.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.910
But I can try,

38:07.952 --> 38:10.955
when they're people
I care about.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.043
(starts engine)

38:16.085 --> 38:17.628
(sniffles)

38:18.379 --> 38:20.715
(shudders)

38:23.092 --> 38:24.427
BARCLAY:
The deterioration

38:24.468 --> 38:26.554
of the casing did not cause
permanent damage.

38:26.595 --> 38:29.390
It should operate as needed when
joined with the other pieces.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.643
Mm. Won't He do it.
(chuckles softly)

38:32.685 --> 38:36.022
I still can't believe you legit
went through that man's bag.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.398
What's next?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.025
Gonna go through
his phone?

38:39.066 --> 38:40.568
Follow him
from a finsta?

38:40.609 --> 38:42.987
(stammers) It was
not my best work.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.905
But now we have this list.

38:44.947 --> 38:47.992
It's initials with latitude
and longitudes.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.911
And the, uh,
first set of initials

38:50.953 --> 38:53.205
crossed out are B.S.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.375
Barton Swift.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.377
You think it's
a hit list?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.754
I don't-- I don't know.

38:59.795 --> 39:00.838
ISAAC: There's no way
Calvin's men

39:00.880 --> 39:02.089
should've gotten
the jump on you.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.924
How did
they catch you?

39:03.966 --> 39:05.718
I saw these guys walk out.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.389
I just knew
they were gonna see Tom

39:10.431 --> 39:12.767
and stop him from getting
the capsule piece,

39:12.808 --> 39:15.144
so I put myself in their way.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.938
If I'm hallucinating
like my mom,

39:17.980 --> 39:20.232
she's the only person who
can help me figure it out.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.612
My contact came through
in locating your mom.

39:24.653 --> 39:25.613
You still want to meet her?

39:25.654 --> 39:26.655
Yes.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.407
Uh, can we keep this on the low?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.825
Yeah.
Yeah?

39:29.867 --> 39:31.702
Aunt Lorraine would
freak if she finds out.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.037
ZENZI:
Oh, my God.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.998
Uh...

39:36.040 --> 39:38.167
this set of coordinates
on the list

39:38.209 --> 39:38.959
is for San Diego,

39:39.001 --> 39:40.878
with the initials O.A.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.632
Dr. Odi Adesina had a stroke
in San Diego last week.

39:44.673 --> 39:47.385
The physicist that's
pioneering wormhole theories?
Yeah.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.011
Flying too close
to the sun.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.930
What's the next
set of initials?
Um...

39:50.971 --> 39:52.848
It's X.C. But I don't--
I don't know who that is.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.017
Uh, uh, uh,
Dr. Xochitl Castros.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.144
She's working on a
brain-computer interface

39:57.186 --> 39:59.480
that allows astronauts
to operate robots in space

39:59.522 --> 40:00.815
without leaving Earth.
(phone keys clacking)

40:00.856 --> 40:02.483
She had a heart attack
in her lab

40:02.525 --> 40:03.943
in Portland
yesterday morning.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.153
She's in critical
condition.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.697
Eskol was in Portland
yesterday.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.035
The Road Back
isn't targeting tech.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.912
They're targeting
the people behind it.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.957
My father wasn't The
Road Back's only mark.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.960
He was the beginning.
