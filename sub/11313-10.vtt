WEBVTT

00:10.845 --> 00:13.612
A living person who lives here
was horribly abused.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.014
This person has PK.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.487
I think that she's seen it.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.856
So you think whatever's here
is capable of killing your guys?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.691
I think it is.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.726
Is it trying to kill her?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.094
Yeah.

00:29.096 --> 00:32.296
I just see the word death.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.199
I just hear death.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.569
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.671
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:39.673 --> 00:42.174
I see dead people.
Her face was all demonic.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.176
I speak to dead people.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.778
He's like,
"You think you can stop me?

00:45.780 --> 00:46.845
Because you can't."

00:52.720 --> 00:54.620
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.904 --> 01:11.737
But Steve and I never speak.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.307
Until the very end.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.642
This dead guy
doing that to her?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.777
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:22.683 --> 01:25.584
Somebody's gonna
die over there soon, yeah.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.412
He says whatever's in the house
is scaring his family to death.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.519
and said we're
his very last hope.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.160
Before Amy arrives,

02:08.162 --> 02:10.628
I clear the house
of any leading information.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.897
Family photographs

02:11.899 --> 02:15.200
and other personal items
can influence her findings,

02:15.202 --> 02:17.336
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.623
There's a male,
an older male grabbing me.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.460
He's, really not good.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.733
is a big problem here.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.668
They can physically feel him.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.003
He can, like,

02:51.005 --> 02:53.272
you know, touch 'em, grab 'em.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.007
He's grabbing me.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.152
So, Steve, I gotta tell you,
this is one of the few cases

03:22.937 --> 03:24.636
if we didn't get
something done to it.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.205
So you think whatever's here
is capable of killing your guys?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.373
I think it is.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.808
Is it affecting everybody?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.677
I think it's
affecting everybody.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.811
Okay.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.279
Who exactly lives
in the house with you?

03:34.281 --> 03:37.849
Well, this is my wife, Donna.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.994
And then Nikola
is my other step-daughter.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.063
Okay. What exactly are you guys
going through?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.598
What experiences are you having?

03:58.072 --> 04:02.040
um, shadows and some attacks,

04:05.879 --> 04:10.015
it -- it's just hardly
any peace around the house

04:11.986 --> 04:15.487
Lately, we're all separated.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.422
And we -- we never
do anything together.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.091
Everybody stays in their room.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.591
It's really hard to live here.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.794
So which daughter
are you worried about?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.659
And then my son comes to me

04:53.661 --> 04:56.061
and he has a bite.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.462
And that's when we decided

04:57.464 --> 04:59.531
we have to do something
about it.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.266
It's extremely hard

05:01.268 --> 05:04.736
to see your kids
get tortured like this.

05:10.878 --> 05:14.212
A living person
got hit here

05:14.214 --> 05:17.349
by this man.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.489
These living people,
they have a lot of pain.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.859
He's always grabbing someone
at the neck.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.098
that'll make, like,
their ear hurt,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.566
their neck hurt,
their, you know,

05:34.568 --> 05:36.768
all in here, having,

05:36.770 --> 05:42.340
like, major, like,
**** pain.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.655
So why'd you bring me in here?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.824
We're seeing shadows
all the time.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.358
Okay, where are you
seeing them?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.461
They're originating
from the middle of the hall

06:02.463 --> 06:05.097
and they're coming down
through here toward the kitchen.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.799
It seemed like its about
6 to 7 foot tall,

06:07.801 --> 06:09.935
solid black mass.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.269
Is it shaped like a human?

06:11.271 --> 06:13.271
Yes.
This is a quiet block.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.306
Nobody's walking by.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.308
Very quiet.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.111
You don't even have cars
coming by here very often.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.546
Okay.
So anything else?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.315
Well, we're hearing voices.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.858
Never any of 'em.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.859
Okay.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.571
He gets really mad in here.
I don't know why.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.082
I don't know if he,
like, stomps around,

06:57.084 --> 06:58.650
or yelling.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.486
They would hear him go
**** ballistic in here.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.932
I was laying in bed,
early morning.

07:17.671 --> 07:21.540
I get up and then
I got poked again in the bedroom

07:21.542 --> 07:23.475
and it left a big bruise.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.876
All right.
So is it possible

07:24.878 --> 07:26.678
in the middle of the night
you might have poked yourself

07:26.680 --> 07:28.980
or hit yourself against
something, caused that bruise?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.819
If this activity continues,
we're done.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.986
I mean, there's no question.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.922
We can't live like this.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.327
The dude who was, like,
grabbing me, he's just

07:42.329 --> 07:44.396
**** torturing everybody.

07:44.398 --> 07:47.465
The thing is, is,
like, he's hurting people.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.602
Head and neck and upper back
on the right side.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.373
Bad guy.
Torturer, torturer.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.627
And it's very intense.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.230
So I've mostly just
been bedridden,

08:55.168 --> 08:57.702
Have you experienced anything
paranormal in this house,

08:57.704 --> 08:58.937
anything unusual?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.539
I've been scratched recently.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.743
So how deep of a cut
are we talking about?

09:04.745 --> 09:07.979
I -- I took a picture.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.326
I've been having
these nightmares.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.128
Okay.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.980
Ew, aye-yi-yi-yi!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.881
Dear God.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.953
Nah, I hear a woman screaming.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.255
She's gasping.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.958
She's waking up
from a nightmare.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.829
So yeah, they're having a lot --

10:30.831 --> 10:33.264
a **** ton of issues here.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.472
I don't like this bed.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.807
I don't like
this area.

11:08.518 --> 11:10.752
So, Donna, Brittney's gotta
be concerning for you.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.886
She's a beautiful girl.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.363
Breaks my heart.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.499
What kind of experiences
have you had, if any?

11:24.501 --> 11:26.601
I was standing
at the stove, cooking,

11:30.006 --> 11:32.474
and landed right by me.

11:32.476 --> 11:34.909
It's like somebody picked it up
and threw it at me.

11:34.911 --> 11:37.312
I can't see how the hell
that could have happened.

11:44.554 --> 11:46.120
and,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.924
I felt someone come up
and put their arms around me.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.560
Okay, I'm assuming you thought
it was your husband?

11:52.562 --> 11:54.262
Yeah.
So what happened?

11:54.264 --> 11:55.396
You turn around
and there's nobody there?

11:56.533 --> 11:57.699
I think I would
have freaked out.

11:57.701 --> 11:59.067
I did.

11:59.069 --> 12:01.135
After going through everything
that I've gone through,

12:01.137 --> 12:05.874
I don't want my daughter to have
to go through it or my children.

12:08.278 --> 12:12.814
Um, I was molested
when I was 7 years old.

12:12.816 --> 12:16.918
It was traumatizing,
someone I trusted.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.319
Yeah, no doubt.
Well, I'm glad

12:18.321 --> 12:20.855
you, opened up
to me about that.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.226
Okay.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.700
I think that somebody
who is here

12:32.702 --> 12:35.870
was horribly abused as a child.

12:35.872 --> 12:37.005
A living person

12:45.148 --> 12:48.149
This person has PK.

12:48.151 --> 12:51.653
PK manifestations usually come
from a living person.

12:51.655 --> 12:53.087
And when that person gets angry,

12:53.089 --> 12:55.957
it subconsciously sends energy
to that entity.

12:55.959 --> 12:59.027
And that's when all hell
can break loose.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.270
Things disappear.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.639
And, like, literally
they're disappearing.

13:11.641 --> 13:13.741
Like, I mean, like,
into thin air.

13:13.743 --> 13:15.643
I do see, like,
people getting hurt.

13:15.645 --> 13:18.313
So she's essentially
torturing herself.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.555
So I assume
you brought me in here

13:27.557 --> 13:28.723
because you've had experiences.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.724
Yes, I have, several.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.792
Okay, what happened?

13:30.794 --> 13:32.594
Um, my husband was laying here

13:32.596 --> 13:34.462
and I was laying next to him.

13:44.841 --> 13:45.974
that that you could tell?

13:49.112 --> 13:50.812
when I would be about ready
to go to sleep,

13:50.814 --> 13:53.648
I felt like something
just jumped in me.

13:53.650 --> 13:56.751
So now, when Amy talks
about getting jumped,

14:03.760 --> 14:06.861
Okay.
Just queasy feeling all over.

14:09.132 --> 14:10.264
I'm afraid to ask

14:10.266 --> 14:11.766
if anything else
is going on in this room.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.101
Yeah.
I've had something

15:00.083 --> 15:02.016
I think that she's seen it.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.722
throughout this person's life.

15:21.938 --> 15:26.207
It takes your energy from you.

15:26.209 --> 15:28.609
And so then you can't stand up

15:28.611 --> 15:30.578
and you can't walk.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.280
You have to just lay down.

15:32.282 --> 15:35.450
Her and the ****
thing take energy.

15:35.452 --> 15:39.687
And so that's bad for anybody
who, like, lives with her.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.422
Is it
trying to hurt her?

15:41.424 --> 15:42.857
Yeah.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.038
who went after the mob

16:15.040 --> 16:17.107
and may have paid
for it with his life.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.981
So Diane, this guy
you were talking about

16:23.983 --> 16:26.083
on the phone
to me sounds pretty interesting.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.888
This is Robert Bushnell.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.290
When did he wind up
buying my client's property?

16:45.371 --> 16:47.638
and visit often.
Okay.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.179
Okay, so what kind of a guy
was he as an attorney general?

16:56.181 --> 16:58.982
He had a reputation
of being really tough.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.185
He was known to be very
short-tempered as well,

17:02.187 --> 17:04.253
in and out of the court room.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.923
Now, Diane, you mentioned
he went after the mob.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.558
What did you mean by that?

17:33.852 --> 17:36.186
In fact, there was
an article here.

17:36.188 --> 17:41.925
The main owner was put away
for from 12 to 15 years.

17:41.927 --> 17:44.061
Well, the way it sounds,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.395
how this guy went
after the mob,

17:45.397 --> 17:48.732
he might have, 
had some targets on him.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.101
I'm sure he did, yes.

17:54.106 --> 17:58.075
I'm seeing the old guy
who grabbed me again.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.911
You know anything
about him in life?

18:07.686 --> 18:09.653
He's talking about ownership.

18:09.655 --> 18:12.756
He owned, like,
a business, I think.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.993
I feel like he was,
like, established.

18:31.443 --> 18:35.245
I'm getting the fire big time,
big time, again.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.018
They ruled it a heart attack.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.420
Okay.
How old was he at the time.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.689
He was only 53.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.557
Any health issues?
Was he obese?

19:20.559 --> 19:23.326
He was a little bit
overweight for his size,

19:23.328 --> 19:25.796
but nothing that came out,

19:29.234 --> 19:32.402
He had few friends
and many enemies.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.673
60s.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.875
So angry that he died.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.344
Maybe he was looking forward
to moving here.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.382
So far, I've got a family
being terrorized

20:19.384 --> 20:21.585
by bizarre activity
on a property

20:21.587 --> 20:23.553
that was once owned
by an attorney general

20:23.555 --> 20:25.155
who died mysteriously.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.557
But I wanna see
if there's anything else.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.427
Searching through old records,
I find Charles Cessna,

20:30.429 --> 20:31.728
one of the original owners

20:31.730 --> 20:33.730
of the property
and the town's founder.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.003
I don't think Donna
and Steve have a clue

20:40.005 --> 20:42.873
the town founder
owned their property.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.076
who says Charles Cessna's life

20:46.078 --> 20:49.212
was filled with fraud, lies
and violence.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.823
what were you able
to find out about him.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.530
He was a medical doctor
in Chicago.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.773
through newspaper
advertisements.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.042
Okay, so this guy was like
a snake oil salesman basically.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.544
Yes.
Yes, sir.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.045
All right.
How'd that work out for him?

21:22.047 --> 21:24.381
He did get busted twice for that

21:45.671 --> 21:48.605
that shows he is selling
10-acre farmland for people.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.474
And when they get here,
much of looks like this,

21:51.476 --> 21:53.944
which is not good farmland,
like is advertised.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.813
So he tried selling 'em
this crap?

22:09.595 --> 22:13.730
Well, 1917, Mr. Cessna
is a married man

22:16.268 --> 22:18.735
with a young woman
that was working for him,

22:18.737 --> 22:20.303
named Julia Murphy.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.539
Here's a photograph of her.

22:22.541 --> 22:26.543
As they were breaking up,
Cessna flips out, beats her

22:49.167 --> 22:51.601
I'm seeing a young woman.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.737
This dead girl,

22:53.739 --> 22:59.376
she got an impact

23:21.433 --> 23:24.267
She's confused and lost.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.503
But she's really angry.

23:26.505 --> 23:29.873
She's always running
around the house.

23:29.875 --> 23:34.144
She makes people
feel panicky here.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.034
If you need us to investigate

23:58.036 --> 23:59.936
unexplained activity
in your home,

23:59.938 --> 24:02.205
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.707
Click on help me, "Dead Files"
to submit your story,

24:03.709 --> 24:05.175
and we'll help if we can.

24:16.814 --> 24:18.947
So another thing
caught my eye in research:

24:18.949 --> 24:21.516
The original owner
of Steve and Donna's property

24:21.518 --> 24:24.119
seems to have suffered
a lot of tragedy.

24:24.121 --> 24:25.954
I'm heading over
to meet a local historian

24:37.267 --> 24:38.633
So Brenda, I came
across this guy,

24:38.635 --> 24:40.902
Henry Reddick, who lived
on my client's property.

24:40.904 --> 24:42.504
And I know he'd lost a few kids.

24:42.506 --> 24:44.606
But before we get to that,
what do you know about this guy?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.910
Henry Reddick was born
in Macon, Georgia in 1833.

24:48.912 --> 24:52.714
Sometime after that, he moved to
the northwest Florida panhandle

24:52.716 --> 24:54.316
and -- and settled here.
Okay.

24:54.318 --> 24:55.450
What'd he do when he came here?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.352
He was in the mill business,
the timber business.

24:57.354 --> 24:59.621
All right.
So if he's born in 1833,

25:02.192 --> 25:04.726
Yes, he does.
He joins the Confederacy

25:07.531 --> 25:10.532
in his first battle at
what is now Fort Walton Beach.

25:12.436 --> 25:14.436
Doesn't necessarily
go well for him at all.

25:14.438 --> 25:16.338
He ends up in one of the most
horrific battles

25:16.340 --> 25:19.107
of the Civil War
in Franklin, Tennessee.

25:19.109 --> 25:23.245
Over 9,000 are killed and 6,000
of those are Confederates.

25:23.247 --> 25:25.580
He's assigned to burial duty.

25:33.624 --> 25:36.558
this big, fancy graveyard.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.896
I've never seen,
like, so many graves.

25:40.898 --> 25:43.064
It's, like, packed,

25:57.648 --> 25:59.447
All right.
So I know he survives the war.

25:59.449 --> 26:01.283
So does he come back here?

26:01.285 --> 26:02.884
Yes, he does come back
to the area.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.556
Ellen and Etta.

26:07.558 --> 26:10.792
Shortly after Etta was born,
his wife died.

26:10.794 --> 26:13.061
All right.
So I know he remarries again.

26:14.731 --> 26:18.900
In 1874, he marries a widow
whose name is Elizabeth.

26:18.902 --> 26:20.402
Any kids together.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.071
Henry and Elizabeth
have eight children together.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.177
three of them died.

26:44.528 --> 26:46.628
This was back a ways.

26:46.630 --> 26:48.597
And she's, like, freaking out.

26:51.034 --> 26:53.702
She is banging
on a dining room table.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.540
Her child died.

27:13.557 --> 27:17.359
There was a gigantic bed
in the room.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.773
and leg.

27:31.775 --> 27:35.243
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:55.616 --> 27:58.917
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:01.989 --> 28:04.089
for the first time.

28:04.091 --> 28:05.490
Amy, I'd like you to meet Donna.

28:05.492 --> 28:09.060
This is her daughter, Brittney,
and her husband, Steve.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.996
Now everybody's having
a bad time here.

28:10.998 --> 28:14.199
But Steve is convinced
that whatever's here

28:17.004 --> 28:20.672
Now, she may look fine, 
but she's not doing well.

28:33.053 --> 28:35.620
When I first entered the house,

28:39.626 --> 28:42.060
It was packed with bodies.

28:42.062 --> 28:43.428
I kept being told

28:43.430 --> 28:45.864
that this was
extremely important

28:50.804 --> 28:53.772
Then, I was shown this female.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.941
And she was pounding on a table

28:55.943 --> 28:58.844
and screaming that her --
I guess a child

28:58.846 --> 29:01.646
of hers had just died.
All right.

29:01.648 --> 29:04.049
So there's a few things
that you should know about.

29:06.019 --> 29:07.719
I think it's just over a half
a mile from here.

29:07.721 --> 29:10.222
And it was part
of the original property line.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.425
Now one of the original owners
of the property

29:13.427 --> 29:16.795
has a direct connection
to the graveyard here.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.550
And he was older.

29:38.552 --> 29:42.521
And he's kind
of a big issue here.

29:42.523 --> 29:45.156
I saw him attacking
living people,

29:45.158 --> 29:47.225
trying to physically
torture people.

29:50.731 --> 29:52.531
Like, he's holding me.

29:52.533 --> 29:57.402
I think he can possibly
jump people as well.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.873
Yeah, I'm getting
ready for bed.

30:01.875 --> 30:03.808
And I'm just relaxing.

30:03.810 --> 30:06.778
And I feel just
the weirdest feeling.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.281
It's almost like choking,
nausea.

30:09.283 --> 30:12.017
And I just jumped totally
out of bed.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.252
I felt like somebody
just went through me,

30:14.254 --> 30:15.453
just terrorizing me.

30:15.455 --> 30:16.755
It's shocking.

30:16.757 --> 30:20.525
The reason why he does
this is to dominate and control.

30:20.527 --> 30:25.964
I think that the living
would experience this dead guy

30:25.966 --> 30:27.699
in several different ways.

30:33.740 --> 30:36.641
Now, you've also been...

30:55.195 --> 30:57.028
and I notice these scratches

30:57.030 --> 30:58.863
here,

30:58.865 --> 31:00.966
along here and down on my leg.

31:03.070 --> 31:07.339
I didn't have
an explanation for them.

31:07.341 --> 31:10.809
And this is what happened
to Steve's son.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.550
Okay. Any idea who this guy
might be in life.

31:18.552 --> 31:20.952
I think he moved here
at some point

31:20.954 --> 31:22.621
or was about to.

31:22.623 --> 31:24.990
I saw that he had
a business back east.

31:27.394 --> 31:30.195
that played a very important
role in his life.

31:30.197 --> 31:31.396
In fact, my --

31:31.398 --> 31:33.765
my back caught fire
and I --

31:33.767 --> 31:37.168
I could feel it burning.

31:37.170 --> 31:38.203
Why'd you guys
have that reaction

31:38.205 --> 31:39.671
when she told you
about this guy?

31:39.673 --> 31:43.942
'Cause she's always
got burning pain.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.578
I got that he dropped dead
in his 50s or 60s,

31:46.580 --> 31:48.913
I think from a heart attack.

31:52.653 --> 31:55.587
And he's extremely pissed off
about his death

31:55.589 --> 31:59.157
because he was really, really
looking forward to moving here.

31:59.159 --> 32:00.425
There is somebody
that could fit the bill.

32:00.427 --> 32:01.826
There's a previous owner
of the land

32:01.828 --> 32:04.996
that comes to mind, actually,
this guy Robert Bushnell.

32:04.998 --> 32:07.799
He was the attorney general
of Massachusetts.

32:19.079 --> 32:21.713
His biggest case
that caught my attention

32:21.715 --> 32:24.582
that killed over 490 people.

32:24.584 --> 32:26.151
Now, this fire took place

32:26.153 --> 32:29.320
at a nightclub in Boston
called the Cocoanut Grove.

32:34.361 --> 32:35.460
Now the other thing
was, you said

32:35.462 --> 32:37.262
the guy died of a heart attack

32:39.399 --> 32:42.467
In 1949, at the age of 53,
he dies of a heart attack.

32:58.151 --> 33:02.620
The next thing was
down the hall,

33:02.622 --> 33:04.589
and then the right.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.630
I got that the living female

33:12.632 --> 33:14.766
that is in that room,

33:14.768 --> 33:17.469
is dealing with a lot of issues.

33:17.471 --> 33:20.638
And it's many different types
of issues.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.074
I felt extremely sick in there,

33:23.076 --> 33:26.277
stomach pain,
intense stomach pains.

33:26.279 --> 33:29.314
I saw this female screaming,

33:29.316 --> 33:31.750
gasping, waking form nightmares.

33:35.756 --> 33:36.888
That's Brittney's room.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.089
That's your room?

33:38.091 --> 33:40.258
Interesting.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.459
You know, I look fine,

33:41.461 --> 33:44.295
but inside, it's torture.

33:44.297 --> 33:49.868
Um, stomach pains, back pain.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.478
The next thing
that I encountered was

34:33.480 --> 34:34.746
in the master bedroom area.

34:34.748 --> 34:37.114
I got that there was
a living female in there

34:37.117 --> 34:40.284
who was horribly
abused as a child.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.219
I got that she has struggled
with addictions

34:42.222 --> 34:44.989
and possibly struggles with OCD.

34:52.699 --> 34:56.234
But it's kind of important
at this point.

34:56.235 --> 34:58.570
You had some abuse issues
as a child.

34:58.572 --> 35:01.406
Yeah, I was
7, 8 years old.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.946
attempted to molest me.

35:10.417 --> 35:13.918
And I thought that's something
I put behind me.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.221
Obviously you didn't put it
behind you.

35:16.223 --> 35:17.956
Probably not.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.360
So the thing I'm most
concerned about

35:50.323 --> 35:52.790
And I saw a scene
of this thing with the --

35:52.792 --> 35:53.925
with the female in bed.

36:01.101 --> 36:03.401
Well, this ain't good.

36:03.403 --> 36:04.903
My gosh.

36:04.905 --> 36:06.437
Yeah.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.577
That's probably
what I saw hovering over you.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.150
At least I know I'm not nuts.
But I feel nuts.

36:22.856 --> 36:24.856
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:24.858 --> 36:26.424
Looks like it.

36:26.426 --> 36:29.227
That thing
is a PK manifestation.

36:42.575 --> 36:47.011
Because it has somewhat
formed a personality of its own,

36:49.549 --> 36:51.950
to living indi--
individuals.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.622
So the scratch marks
and the bruises,

36:57.624 --> 36:59.390
could that be coming from Donna?

36:59.392 --> 37:02.660
From your subconscious.

37:02.662 --> 37:04.095
And when she gets angry
or upset,

37:04.097 --> 37:07.699
she's able
to make objects disappear.

37:07.701 --> 37:11.803
Yeah, she's always complaining
that something's missing.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.013
So the thing is,
I sat down at the table,

37:22.015 --> 37:25.550
the first thing I got with you
was psychic empath healer.

37:25.552 --> 37:28.987
And the problem
with being a psychic empath

37:28.989 --> 37:31.222
is that you're
in close proximity

37:31.224 --> 37:35.026
with someone
who is a physical medium

37:35.028 --> 37:37.228
who has flaring PK.

37:37.230 --> 37:39.263
And so she's drawing
a lot of energy

37:39.265 --> 37:41.432
from everyone in the house
to the point

37:41.434 --> 37:44.469
where it's draining you
and making you sick.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.870
God.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.973
Like, a lot of people will refer
to it as psychic vampirism.

38:33.736 --> 38:36.237
We know why Brittney's
been so sick,

38:36.239 --> 38:40.074
why everybody's been
so depressed and drained,

38:40.076 --> 38:43.311
and why things have actually
gotten so physical.

38:59.395 --> 39:00.795
that you'll have
to do consistently

39:00.797 --> 39:04.532
for the rest of your life.

39:04.534 --> 39:08.269
Donna, I would like you
to find a psychotherapist.

39:08.271 --> 39:09.537
You need an outlet.

39:09.539 --> 39:12.406
And that's going to be
a really good outlet

39:12.408 --> 39:14.775
for you to feel comfortable
in a space

39:14.777 --> 39:16.177
that you can share
anything and everything

39:16.179 --> 39:17.512
that's bothering you.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.360
I -- I am so grateful, um,

40:09.265 --> 40:10.798
even a little bit better.

40:10.800 --> 40:14.135
That works for me.

40:22.845 --> 40:25.446
remove what doesn't need to be
here anymore and bring in light,

40:25.448 --> 40:27.214
love and positivity

40:27.216 --> 40:30.384
and to set up boundaries
for the dead.

40:36.159 --> 40:39.260
But what they'll do
is also set up boundaries

40:39.262 --> 40:41.996
so that the dead
can't come in anymore.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.222
It's hard to
forgive yourself.

41:08.224 --> 41:09.390
Yeah.
All right.

41:09.392 --> 41:12.493
But you're not doing just
for you now.

41:12.495 --> 41:14.195
You're doing it for your family.

41:14.197 --> 41:16.497
Yes.

41:16.499 --> 41:19.100
That's important to me.

41:20.637 --> 41:23.571
I mean,
my family's too important to me.

41:36.986 --> 41:38.986
But, with the help
of a psychotherapist

41:38.988 --> 41:40.388
and a reiki master,

41:40.390 --> 41:43.691
they can banish the dead
and weaken the PK,

41:43.693 --> 41:46.293
allowing them to lead
a peaceful life.
