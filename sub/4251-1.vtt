00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
<b></b>

01:18.250 --> 01:20.340
<b>Anne.</b>

01:26.990 --> 01:28.580
<b>Mary.</b>

01:29.130 --> 01:30.750
<b>Wait.</b>

01:32.100 --> 01:33.150
<b>Wait for me.</b>

01:33.330 --> 01:36.160
<b><i>I received a request
for marriage today...</i></b>

01:36.330 --> 01:39.630
<b><i>... for Anne from the Carey family.</i></b>

01:39.800 --> 01:42.360
<b><i>William, their eldest son.</i></b>

01:42.540 --> 01:44.100
<b>Oh, that's wonderful.</b>

01:44.270 --> 01:48.540
<b>I turned it down.
Offered them Mary instead.</b>

01:49.780 --> 01:51.410
<b>Mary.</b>

01:52.020 --> 01:55.140
<b><i>Everyone improves the standing
of their family with their daughters.</i></b>

01:55.320 --> 01:58.080
<b>I think Anne can do a lot better
than a merchant's son.</b>

01:59.060 --> 02:00.250
<b>And Mary can't?</b>

02:01.290 --> 02:05.350
<b>- I think you underestimate her.
- No, no, that's not true.</b>

02:05.830 --> 02:10.130
<b>I think she's the kinder of the two,
quite possibly the fairer.</b>

02:10.600 --> 02:13.570
<b>To get ahead in this world,
you need more than fair looks...</b>

02:13.740 --> 02:15.030
<b>...and a kind heart.</b>

02:15.210 --> 02:17.230
<b>I'll beat you, I'll beat you.</b>

02:17.410 --> 02:18.970
<b>Hey.</b>

02:26.720 --> 02:31.020
<b>Well done, Anne.
Well done, children.</b>

03:39.790 --> 03:42.780
<b>You look... You look adequate.</b>

03:42.960 --> 03:47.230
<b>Not too adequate, I hope.
This is our sister's day.</b>

03:47.400 --> 03:49.990
<b>One wouldn't want to outshine her.</b>

03:59.980 --> 04:02.710
<b>Mary, may we come in?</b>

04:06.650 --> 04:07.910
<b>Look at you.</b>

04:09.090 --> 04:13.040
<b>Younger than me.
More beautiful than me.</b>

04:13.220 --> 04:18.180
<b>Married before me. I'm eclipsed.
I'm the other Boleyn girl.</b>

04:18.400 --> 04:19.860
<b>Hardly.</b>

04:20.530 --> 04:24.260
<b>So is this it, Mrs. Carey?</b>

04:24.430 --> 04:26.560
<b>Do we...?
Do we lose you now, forever?</b>

04:26.740 --> 04:30.070
<b>No, never. I'll be married, that's all.</b>

04:30.240 --> 04:32.110
<b>Apart from that,
it won't change a thing.</b>

04:33.910 --> 04:39.210
<b>Come, George, let's leave our sister.
She needs to make herself pretty.</b>

04:57.830 --> 04:59.860
<b>Was it a boy?</b>

05:04.440 --> 05:06.930
<b>Stillborn, Your Majesty.</b>

05:14.180 --> 05:18.450
<b>No brother for you
to make this country safe.</b>

05:21.290 --> 05:23.380
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

05:29.200 --> 05:31.290
<b>Tell His Majesty.</b>

05:43.350 --> 05:45.040
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

05:46.250 --> 05:47.940
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

05:51.760 --> 05:53.780
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

06:41.570 --> 06:42.600
<b>Are you happy?</b>

06:42.940 --> 06:44.130
<b>I am.</b>

06:44.310 --> 06:47.370
<b>You don't wish you'd married
someone grander? With a title?</b>

06:47.810 --> 06:49.570
<b>I want a husband who loves me.</b>

06:49.750 --> 06:52.680
<b>Who thinks it first thing every morning
and last thing at night.</b>

06:52.850 --> 06:54.480
<b>Then you have found the right man.</b>

07:00.890 --> 07:02.920
<b>He continues to stare.</b>

07:03.090 --> 07:04.990
<b>- Who?
- Henry Percy.</b>

07:05.160 --> 07:07.760
<b>Well, why ever
would he interest you?</b>

07:07.930 --> 07:09.800
<b>What could you want
with the sole heir...</b>

07:09.970 --> 07:11.760
<b>...to the richest landowner
in England?</b>

07:11.940 --> 07:14.460
<b>Oh, I had no knowledge of that.
I simply like his face.</b>

07:14.640 --> 07:15.660
<b>Oh, really?</b>

07:17.510 --> 07:21.570
<b>- Well, he's betrothed.
- Betrothed is not married.</b>

07:21.740 --> 07:25.080
<b>It's a long journey
from bended knee to the altar.</b>

07:30.550 --> 07:33.220
<b>- Sister.
- Hello, brother.</b>

07:34.360 --> 07:35.590
<b>Thomas.</b>

07:35.760 --> 07:38.230
<b>- A proud day for you.
- Yes.</b>

07:40.260 --> 07:42.160
<b>How is His Majesty?</b>

07:42.330 --> 07:44.820
<b>These are difficult times, Thomas.</b>

07:46.440 --> 07:48.400
<b>The king and queen,
once happily married...</b>

07:48.570 --> 07:50.300
<b>...now barely speak.</b>

07:50.470 --> 07:53.070
<b>The failure to provide a male heir
has consumed them.</b>

07:54.610 --> 07:58.450
<b>The queen has lost yet another child,
a boy.</b>

07:58.820 --> 08:02.380
<b>I imagine it won't be long before
he seeks solace with a mistress.</b>

08:05.360 --> 08:07.260
<b>I've given it some thought
and wondered...</b>

08:07.420 --> 08:09.820
<b>...which Howard girl
I can place under his nose.</b>

08:10.730 --> 08:14.160
<b>You imagine the riches and influence
that would give us?</b>

08:14.330 --> 08:18.270
<b>If we could help the king
with this delicate matter?</b>

08:20.070 --> 08:21.590
<b>What about Anne?</b>

08:23.610 --> 08:28.040
<b>I realize, as a Boleyn,
she's not officially a Howard...</b>

08:28.210 --> 08:29.800
<b>...but as your sister's daughter.</b>

08:29.980 --> 08:34.350
<b>But, Thomas, she's your first born,
and your favorite.</b>

08:34.750 --> 08:38.480
<b>Wouldn't you prefer her to have
a simple, uncomplicated marriage?</b>

08:38.660 --> 08:39.680
<b>Like Mary?</b>

08:40.390 --> 08:43.290
<b>If Anne were a simple,
uncomplicated girl like Mary...</b>

08:43.460 --> 08:46.590
<b>...l'd say yes. But she's not.</b>

08:47.430 --> 08:49.460
<b>She's anything but.</b>

09:02.310 --> 09:03.870
<b>Are you afraid?</b>

09:07.420 --> 09:08.610
<b>A little.</b>

09:10.650 --> 09:13.710
<b>I should be able to tell you
how it will be tonight.</b>

09:15.330 --> 09:17.120
<b>Give you advice on what to do.</b>

09:18.960 --> 09:21.330
<b>I've failed you as an elder sister.</b>

09:22.430 --> 09:25.160
<b>No one could wish
for a better sister.</b>

09:45.190 --> 09:46.920
<b>And tell me everything
in the morning.</b>

09:47.090 --> 09:51.120
<b>- I promise.
- No details spared.</b>

10:27.000 --> 10:28.550
<b>Lie back.</b>

10:56.190 --> 10:58.420
<b>- Anne.
- Father.</b>

11:00.130 --> 11:01.530
<b>Uncle.</b>

11:02.430 --> 11:03.900
<b>You asked to see me.</b>

11:04.070 --> 11:05.730
<b>An opportunity has arisen.</b>

11:05.900 --> 11:08.030
<b>An opportunity in which,
were you to succeed...</b>

11:08.200 --> 11:10.730
<b>...you could secure for yourself
and for this family...</b>

11:10.910 --> 11:12.600
<b>...incalculable wealth and position.</b>

11:12.780 --> 11:15.370
<b>There is a strain
on the king's marriage.</b>

11:16.510 --> 11:20.240
<b>In such circumstances, a man
sometimes seeks comfort elsewhere.</b>

11:20.420 --> 11:22.910
<b>Because of your uncle's friendship
with His Majesty...</b>

11:23.090 --> 11:25.420
<b>...we're alone in knowing this.
It won't be long...</b>

11:25.590 --> 11:28.080
<b>...before the other families
discover the truth...</b>

11:28.260 --> 11:30.660
<b>...and parade their daughters
under his nose.</b>

11:30.830 --> 11:33.590
<b>Before watching somebody else profit,
we would sooner have...</b>

11:33.760 --> 11:35.160
<b>What?</b>

11:35.330 --> 11:38.390
<b>- Have me bed him instead?
- No, that... That's not...</b>

11:38.570 --> 11:40.000
<b>Yes.</b>

11:41.040 --> 11:42.330
<b>Exactly.</b>

11:44.770 --> 11:50.680
<b>The favor he would bestow upon us...
I mean upon you, if he liked you.</b>

11:50.850 --> 11:55.880
<b>To be mistress of the king of England
is by no means to diminish yourself.</b>

11:56.050 --> 11:57.680
<b>And after he's finished with me?</b>

11:57.850 --> 11:59.820
<b>My reputation and prospects
will be ruined.</b>

11:59.990 --> 12:01.010
<b>On the contrary.</b>

12:01.820 --> 12:03.950
<b>Under such circumstances,
when the time came...</b>

12:04.130 --> 12:07.650
<b>...to find you a husband, it would
be a marquis or a duke at least.</b>

12:11.430 --> 12:13.300
<b>Will you accept the challenge?</b>

12:25.980 --> 12:28.040
<b>Don't resist this.</b>

12:28.250 --> 12:31.550
<b>The king and his retinue
will spend two nights here next month.</b>

12:31.720 --> 12:33.590
<b>Your brother has arranged it.
It's done.</b>

12:33.760 --> 12:36.690
<b>Well, I don't like it.
It'll cost a fortune to get this house...</b>

12:36.860 --> 12:40.350
<b>...ready for a royal visit.
It's money we can't afford.</b>

12:40.530 --> 12:42.000
<b>And what if he doesn't like her?</b>

12:42.170 --> 12:45.570
<b>And what if you were to look
on the bright side, just once?</b>

12:45.740 --> 12:48.300
<b>Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
Anne understands that.</b>

12:48.470 --> 12:52.130
<b>Anne understands nothing.
She's just a child.</b>

12:52.310 --> 12:56.270
<b>Tell me, when was it that people
stopped thinking of ambition as a sin...</b>

12:56.450 --> 12:58.440
<b>...and started thinking of it
as a virtue?</b>

12:59.950 --> 13:01.470
<b>That's easy for you to say.</b>

13:01.650 --> 13:03.920
<b>You've had position
and wealth all your life.</b>

13:04.920 --> 13:10.420
<b>Until I married you, Thomas.
And I was happy to give it up for love.</b>

13:14.800 --> 13:17.930
<b>So how was it, the wedding night?</b>

13:20.000 --> 13:22.530
<b>It was very satisfactory.</b>

13:22.710 --> 13:26.470
<b>Really? William Carey,
a good lover.</b>

13:26.640 --> 13:28.130
<b>Yes.</b>

13:30.410 --> 13:33.510
<b>Oh, God. He was in rather a hurry.</b>

13:33.680 --> 13:35.710
<b>- And he snores.
- No.</b>

13:35.890 --> 13:38.580
<b>He got up in the middle of the night
and used a pisspot...</b>

13:38.750 --> 13:42.320
<b>...by the side of the bed.
It was awful.</b>

13:42.490 --> 13:43.720
<b>No.</b>

13:47.500 --> 13:49.960
<b>I also have something to tell you.</b>

13:50.130 --> 13:52.400
<b>Last night,
our father put his trust in me...</b>

13:52.570 --> 13:55.130
<b>...and gave me a commission.</b>

13:55.300 --> 13:56.330
<b>Tell, tell.</b>

13:57.370 --> 13:59.200
<b>To divert the king.</b>

13:59.380 --> 14:01.840
<b>The king of England himself,
on his visit.</b>

14:02.010 --> 14:03.570
<b>Divert him?</b>

14:03.750 --> 14:08.080
<b>Divert him. Beguile him.
Enchant him.</b>

14:08.650 --> 14:10.410
<b>He has a wife.</b>

14:10.590 --> 14:13.110
<b>I know.
But who knows what could happen?</b>

14:13.290 --> 14:16.550
<b>If he liked me,
I'd be married off to a duke.</b>

14:17.030 --> 14:19.360
<b>I could be a happy duchess.</b>

14:54.960 --> 14:56.800
<b>The king.</b>

14:58.400 --> 14:59.700
<b>The king.</b>

15:01.340 --> 15:02.740
<b>The king will be here betimes.</b>

15:02.910 --> 15:04.570
<b>- The king.
- Look alive.</b>

15:04.740 --> 15:06.440
<b>The king.</b>

15:09.780 --> 15:11.800
<b>To your places.</b>

15:12.550 --> 15:14.710
<b>Come on, set to, everyone.
The king.</b>

15:14.880 --> 15:17.010
<b>Take the horses to the yard
and prepare.</b>

15:19.920 --> 15:21.450
<b>Where's the spit boy?
Where is he?</b>

15:21.620 --> 15:24.060
<b>Get over here.</b>

15:29.430 --> 15:31.560
<b>Do you think he'll like me?</b>

15:32.400 --> 15:34.770
<b>Course he will, sister.</b>

15:35.770 --> 15:37.760
<b>How could he not?</b>

16:48.110 --> 16:49.910
<b>Sir Thomas.</b>

16:50.910 --> 16:53.310
<b>Your Majesty.
You're most welcome.</b>

16:55.990 --> 16:57.180
<b>Lady Elizabeth.</b>

16:59.460 --> 17:02.220
<b>May I present my daughter, Anne.</b>

17:02.390 --> 17:05.420
<b>A daughter?
No one said anything of a daughter.</b>

17:05.590 --> 17:07.990
<b>Had we known,
we might have come sooner.</b>

17:08.630 --> 17:10.360
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

17:42.900 --> 17:47.160
<b>Anne, Anne.
Go to bed, get a good night's rest.</b>

17:47.340 --> 17:51.030
<b>Tomorrow there's the hunt.
You must excel at that.</b>

17:51.210 --> 17:53.730
<b>Everything depends upon it.</b>

18:18.970 --> 18:20.090
<b>Good morning, Anne.</b>

18:20.270 --> 18:21.530
<b>Good morning, Your Grace.</b>

18:22.400 --> 18:26.000
<b>- Who will you ride with?
- On my own, Your Grace.</b>

18:26.180 --> 18:27.440
<b>On your own?</b>

18:27.610 --> 18:29.580
<b>There's a new saddle now
which allows this.</b>

18:33.620 --> 18:35.080
<b>But with no man to hold on to...</b>

18:35.250 --> 18:37.220
<b>...how do you propose
to stay on the horse?</b>

18:37.390 --> 18:38.790
<b>As you do, Your Grace.</b>

18:39.820 --> 18:41.920
<b>With my thighs.</b>

18:44.790 --> 18:46.120
<b>Away.</b>

19:18.560 --> 19:20.390
<b>What's keeping them?</b>

19:29.140 --> 19:30.730
<b>Where are they?</b>

20:07.640 --> 20:08.670
<b>Is someone hurt?</b>

20:11.210 --> 20:12.270
<b>My God, it's the king.</b>

20:12.820 --> 20:16.440
<b>The king? What? What happened?</b>

20:16.950 --> 20:19.650
<b>The stag went into the woods
and led us to the deep ravine.</b>

20:20.320 --> 20:23.380
<b>Everyone was prepared to concede
defeat and let the animal go.</b>

20:24.390 --> 20:25.420
<b>Except Anne.</b>

20:25.590 --> 20:28.890
<b>Oh, no. What?
She knows that ravine.</b>

20:29.060 --> 20:31.560
<b>She must have ridden it
a thousand times.</b>

20:33.940 --> 20:36.700
<b>What, and the king followed,
and then he fell?</b>

20:46.020 --> 20:47.040
<b>Oh, Lord.</b>

20:48.920 --> 20:50.850
<b>- What happened?
- He fell.</b>

20:51.020 --> 20:52.780
<b>He's in some pain.</b>

20:52.960 --> 20:55.820
<b>Although I suspect
his pride is hurting rather more.</b>

20:56.330 --> 20:58.520
<b>It was my fault.</b>

20:58.690 --> 21:00.690
<b>- Anne.
- How could I?</b>

21:00.860 --> 21:02.690
<b>Fetch Mary to me, would you?</b>

21:23.450 --> 21:24.510
<b>And who are you?</b>

21:26.090 --> 21:27.580
<b>Mary, Your Grace.</b>

21:29.060 --> 21:31.050
<b>Anne's sister.</b>

21:36.400 --> 21:38.560
<b>You've been here all the time?</b>

21:39.740 --> 21:42.140
<b>How could I have overlooked you?</b>

21:44.010 --> 21:46.770
<b>Next to Anne, it's easy to do.</b>

21:55.720 --> 21:57.380
<b>And you're married.</b>

21:57.550 --> 22:00.990
<b>Yes, Your Grace, to William Carey.</b>

22:01.960 --> 22:04.320
<b>Then why haven't I seen you at court?</b>

22:05.590 --> 22:08.790
<b>Because I've persuaded him
to spend a year or two here first.</b>

22:09.870 --> 22:11.490
<b>We have a small manor.</b>

22:11.670 --> 22:14.690
<b>Nothing much,
but enough to start a family.</b>

22:15.800 --> 22:19.800
<b>Charmed life in the country,
away from it all.</b>

22:20.540 --> 22:22.070
<b>Yes.</b>

22:23.580 --> 22:27.140
<b>You don't think he'll miss court?
A young ambitious man.</b>

22:27.320 --> 22:29.480
<b>He says not, Your Majesty.</b>

22:29.650 --> 22:31.280
<b>But if he ever changed his mind...</b>

22:31.450 --> 22:34.080
<b>...as his wife, of course,
I would do his bidding.</b>

22:50.610 --> 22:52.160
<b>Lady Elizabeth, thank you.</b>

22:56.080 --> 22:57.740
<b>Sir Thomas.</b>

23:00.520 --> 23:02.850
<b>You will take care of that matter?</b>

23:04.250 --> 23:06.980
<b>Yes, of course.
Of course, Your Majesty, thank you.</b>

23:34.980 --> 23:37.680
<b>Mary, you've obviously made
a deep impression on the king.</b>

23:37.850 --> 23:40.650
<b>He's requested that you come to court
with immediate effect.</b>

23:40.820 --> 23:45.990
<b>The king has secured for you,
a position in the queen's household.</b>

23:47.900 --> 23:51.260
<b>But I don't want to go to court.
Nor does my husband.</b>

23:56.470 --> 23:59.340
<b>The king has also
offered me a position...</b>

23:59.840 --> 24:01.670
<b>...as a gentleman
of the Privy Council.</b>

24:01.840 --> 24:05.580
<b>Do you hear that, Mary?
Privy Council.</b>

24:05.750 --> 24:08.080
<b>Attending upon His Majesty himself.</b>

24:08.580 --> 24:10.380
<b>The inner sanctum.</b>

24:10.550 --> 24:12.380
<b>What about our future
in the country?</b>

24:12.550 --> 24:14.950
<b>Oh, you must put that
out of your mind.</b>

24:15.120 --> 24:16.850
<b>From now on, your future is at court.</b>

24:17.030 --> 24:19.080
<b>William, please.</b>

24:19.330 --> 24:22.320
<b>Don't you understand
what this means? They'll separate us.</b>

24:22.500 --> 24:25.690
<b>Put me in different accommodation,
where the king can always find me.</b>

24:26.500 --> 24:30.770
<b>Happily, your husband understands
the value of such an opportunity.</b>

24:31.440 --> 24:32.630
<b>For us all.</b>

24:37.580 --> 24:40.050
<b>What about Anne?
Couldn't she go instead?</b>

24:40.220 --> 24:41.440
<b>Anne?</b>

24:41.620 --> 24:44.590
<b>The way Anne has behaved,
she's fortunate to be coming at all.</b>

24:54.730 --> 24:56.530
<b>Mother, please, speak to Father.</b>

24:56.700 --> 24:58.530
<b>Do something. I don't want to go.</b>

24:58.700 --> 25:03.930
<b>This is not a request.
We have been summoned.</b>

25:07.140 --> 25:09.240
<b>Please don't be angry with me.</b>

25:09.410 --> 25:11.740
<b>You think I desire to go
for this purpose?</b>

25:11.910 --> 25:14.780
<b>All I know is that a man
that didn't know who you were...</b>

25:14.950 --> 25:17.380
<b>...was with you in that room
for half an hour...</b>

25:17.550 --> 25:18.750
<b>...and came out besotted.</b>

25:19.350 --> 25:21.250
<b>I don't know what you said or did.</b>

25:21.420 --> 25:22.790
<b>Nothing, sister.</b>

25:22.960 --> 25:25.290
<b>Except sing your praises
and talk about my husband.</b>

25:25.460 --> 25:29.020
<b>Really? Well, you must show me
how you did that some time.</b>

26:18.150 --> 26:21.010
<b>- Mary Carey, Your Majesty.
- Who?</b>

26:21.180 --> 26:24.240
<b>Your new lady-in-waiting
and her sister Anne.</b>

26:24.790 --> 26:27.880
<b>Really?
I wasn't aware I was expecting one.</b>

26:28.060 --> 26:32.120
<b>Appointed by His Majesty the king.</b>

26:35.230 --> 26:37.990
<b>By my husband? Really?</b>

26:39.170 --> 26:40.630
<b>Well...</b>

26:41.400 --> 26:45.860
<b>...then she must be some kind of
gift or surprise.</b>

26:46.440 --> 26:50.340
<b>He must have seen in her some talent
he knew would please me.</b>

26:50.750 --> 26:52.210
<b>Tell me.</b>

26:52.380 --> 26:54.850
<b>What special talent is it
that you have...</b>

26:55.020 --> 26:58.510
<b>...apart from your
obvious youth and beauty?</b>

27:01.320 --> 27:02.880
<b>I...</b>

27:06.530 --> 27:09.360
<b>- Poetry, perhaps?
- No.</b>

27:09.530 --> 27:12.130
<b>- Or dressmaking?
- No.</b>

27:12.300 --> 27:15.740
<b>- Singing then, surely?
- No, Your Majesty.</b>

27:15.900 --> 27:19.930
<b>Come, you're too modest.
Sing for us.</b>

27:21.810 --> 27:24.440
<b>- Really, I beg you.
- Sing.</b>

28:07.990 --> 28:09.480
<b>Bravo.</b>

28:11.860 --> 28:13.190
<b>A nightingale.</b>

28:14.860 --> 28:16.850
<b>Welcome at court.</b>

28:23.810 --> 28:24.440
<b>Mary? Stop.</b>

28:24.440 --> 28:26.530
<b>Mary? Stop.</b>

28:27.810 --> 28:29.800
<b>That can't have been easy for you.</b>

28:29.980 --> 28:33.040
<b>But put yourself in the queen's shoes.
She knows the only reason...</b>

28:33.220 --> 28:36.380
<b>...the king has asked you here
is because he desires you.</b>

28:36.550 --> 28:39.020
<b>She's a good woman, trust me.</b>

28:39.620 --> 28:41.590
<b>Jane Parker.</b>

29:15.790 --> 29:18.260
<b>It's embarrassing.</b>

29:18.690 --> 29:20.890
<b>Look, she has her eye on you.</b>

29:21.060 --> 29:23.620
<b>Sweet Jane Parker would be a match
to please our father.</b>

29:23.800 --> 29:25.960
<b>Oh, vile girl.</b>

29:26.130 --> 29:29.040
<b>She's the most ambitious little serpent
at court.</b>

29:30.110 --> 29:31.600
<b>She can't stop watching.</b>

29:45.590 --> 29:47.490
<b>How are you, Stafford?</b>

29:47.660 --> 29:49.390
<b>I'm well, thank you.</b>

29:50.330 --> 29:53.350
<b>I'm not sure I'm one for court life.</b>

29:55.230 --> 29:56.290
<b>I'm a little homesick.</b>

29:58.400 --> 29:59.960
<b>Well, you and I both.</b>

30:00.140 --> 30:03.330
<b>Now, in my view it...
It changes people.</b>

30:04.010 --> 30:06.240
<b>And not necessarily for the better.</b>

30:07.440 --> 30:10.000
<b>Your sister, though, is thriving.</b>

30:10.180 --> 30:12.940
<b>She's truly caught the eye
of Henry Percy.</b>

30:13.110 --> 30:17.070
<b>Why does she do this?
He's already taken.</b>

30:41.610 --> 30:42.630
<b>Tonight.</b>

31:02.660 --> 31:07.360
<b>My little sister.
My little golden sister.</b>

31:08.870 --> 31:11.300
<b>My milk-and-honey sister.</b>

31:11.470 --> 31:12.840
<b>It should be you in my place.</b>

31:13.380 --> 31:15.840
<b>Don't concern yourself with me.</b>

31:18.050 --> 31:20.340
<b>I'll make my own way.</b>

31:25.690 --> 31:26.880
<b>Shall I walk with you?</b>

31:27.060 --> 31:28.580
<b>No need.</b>

31:29.190 --> 31:32.350
<b>Try to please him. If you can.</b>

32:07.960 --> 32:09.690
<b>Your Grace.</b>

32:11.070 --> 32:12.590
<b>Come in.</b>

32:20.780 --> 32:22.270
<b>Can I bring you something?</b>

32:22.440 --> 32:23.930
<b>No.</b>

32:24.750 --> 32:27.720
<b>Anything to ease your comfort
or well-being?</b>

32:29.280 --> 32:33.120
<b>Perhaps you might ask your servants
to bring me some water.</b>

32:36.320 --> 32:37.720
<b>Please.</b>

32:48.970 --> 32:52.370
<b>There. There are no servants.</b>

32:57.110 --> 32:58.940
<b>So this is it?</b>

32:59.310 --> 33:01.680
<b>Where the king of England sleeps.</b>

33:01.850 --> 33:03.370
<b>And reads and writes.</b>

33:03.990 --> 33:06.780
<b>Finds a few moments each day
for himself.</b>

33:07.990 --> 33:10.220
<b>And yet you invite me here?</b>

33:11.660 --> 33:15.100
<b>Because I like you and trust you.</b>

33:16.330 --> 33:18.160
<b>You hardly know me.</b>

33:19.300 --> 33:23.630
<b>I'm lied to a hundred times a day.
Petitioned, lobbied.</b>

33:23.810 --> 33:28.770
<b>One learns how to decipher a face.
And yours is as the sun.</b>

33:28.940 --> 33:31.410
<b>One shouldn't gaze too long.</b>

33:33.350 --> 33:36.250
<b>My flattery,
it makes you uncomfortable.</b>

33:38.150 --> 33:41.090
<b>Because compliments in your family
are usually for someone else.</b>

33:42.890 --> 33:44.880
<b>The elder sister.</b>

33:47.700 --> 33:53.190
<b>That's something I understand.
What it is to be the second child.</b>

33:53.770 --> 33:56.400
<b>Forever in the shadows.</b>

34:00.440 --> 34:02.910
<b>I'm making you uncomfortable
again.</b>

36:02.360 --> 36:03.660
<b>- Morning.
- Stafford.</b>

36:03.830 --> 36:04.860
<b>Morning.</b>

36:05.030 --> 36:06.930
<b>I have orders
to bring you to your father.</b>

36:08.040 --> 36:09.900
<b>Better not keep him waiting.</b>

36:25.020 --> 36:26.540
<b>Well?</b>

36:27.990 --> 36:29.150
<b>Did he have you?</b>

36:36.230 --> 36:37.930
<b>Yes.</b>

36:38.100 --> 36:39.960
<b>More than once?</b>

36:41.740 --> 36:43.670
<b>You better get used
to talking about it.</b>

36:43.840 --> 36:46.770
<b>When you sleep with the king,
it ceases to be a private matter.</b>

36:50.950 --> 36:52.340
<b>Yes, more than once.</b>

36:53.150 --> 36:55.170
<b>And was he satisfied?</b>

36:57.890 --> 37:00.480
<b>- I believe so.
- Did he say so?</b>

37:01.220 --> 37:03.710
<b>He did not need to, uncle.</b>

37:05.630 --> 37:06.860
<b>Well, you may go.</b>

37:16.600 --> 37:18.130
<b>Good.</b>

37:18.840 --> 37:20.900
<b>Now our work begins.</b>

37:21.080 --> 37:24.100
<b>It's one thing to catch a king,
quite another to keep him.</b>

37:24.280 --> 37:27.870
<b>She must be well-read,
know her music, excel in company...</b>

37:28.050 --> 37:30.540
<b>...and she must be clean.</b>

37:30.720 --> 37:33.590
<b>- Anne will see to it.
- See to what?</b>

37:33.760 --> 37:35.920
<b>Mary is already all of these things.</b>

37:36.090 --> 37:38.790
<b>Thanks to the education
I have given her.</b>

37:38.960 --> 37:41.790
<b>And for what?
That she may be traded like cattle...</b>

37:41.960 --> 37:44.430
<b>...for the advancement
and amusement of men?</b>

37:44.600 --> 37:47.500
<b>Sister, you may leave us also.</b>

37:52.940 --> 37:56.380
<b>Katherine of Aragon
will never give Henry Tudor a son.</b>

37:58.550 --> 38:05.180
<b>But if Mary could give him a child,
and that child could be a boy...</b>

39:09.580 --> 39:13.280
<b>If I gave your husband an assignment
that took him away from court...</b>

39:13.450 --> 39:15.720
<b>...would you object?</b>

39:18.860 --> 39:23.260
<b>I would not presume
to interfere in affairs of state.</b>

39:43.150 --> 39:45.520
<b>- Amen.
- Amen.</b>

39:57.570 --> 40:02.030
<b>"My heart and I surrender themselves
into your hands."</b>

40:34.770 --> 40:36.530
<b>It's Anne.</b>

40:37.770 --> 40:39.070
<b>She's married Henry Percy.</b>

40:39.670 --> 40:42.510
<b>Wedded and bedded
without telling anyone.</b>

40:43.010 --> 40:45.170
<b>You... You don't look pleased.</b>

40:45.350 --> 40:46.440
<b>Why would I be pleased?</b>

40:46.610 --> 40:50.020
<b>Well, it will make her the future
Duchess of Northumberland.</b>

40:50.180 --> 40:53.590
<b>- Our sister.
- George, they'll never allow it.</b>

40:53.750 --> 40:55.750
<b>He's already precontracted
to Mary Talbot.</b>

40:55.920 --> 41:01.420
<b>If this gets out, it will damage her.
Her reputation will be ruined.</b>

41:02.100 --> 41:05.620
<b>I have to tell Father.
For her own protection.</b>

41:07.570 --> 41:08.830
<b>What were you thinking?</b>

41:09.000 --> 41:12.300
<b>The marriage of a senior noble
is a matter of the state.</b>

41:12.470 --> 41:14.910
<b>Something only the king can decide.</b>

41:15.510 --> 41:16.940
<b>Who else knows about this?</b>

41:18.050 --> 41:19.480
<b>- No one.
- Good.</b>

41:19.650 --> 41:21.950
<b>Well, that's how it will remain.
Forever.</b>

41:22.120 --> 41:24.950
<b>But you cannot undo
what has been done before God.</b>

41:25.120 --> 41:26.310
<b>And consummated too.</b>

41:28.790 --> 41:32.450
<b>There have been
improper intimacies?</b>

41:33.060 --> 41:34.790
<b>I have lain with my husband.</b>

41:35.630 --> 41:39.930
<b>- There's nothing improper about it.
- By God, if you were my daughter.</b>

41:40.530 --> 41:42.370
<b>The boy will return
to Northumberland...</b>

41:42.540 --> 41:46.470
<b>...where he will marry the Talbot girl,
as arranged.</b>

41:59.150 --> 42:01.210
<b>You will be sent to France
and stay there...</b>

42:01.390 --> 42:04.150
<b>...until you have learned your lesson.
- What?</b>

42:04.330 --> 42:05.690
<b>No.</b>

42:06.130 --> 42:07.150
<b>Father, please.</b>

42:07.330 --> 42:10.490
<b>How can you have done this?
You knew full well...</b>

42:10.670 --> 42:13.860
<b>...Mary's friendship with the king
is at an extremely delicate stage.</b>

42:14.040 --> 42:18.340
<b>Any scandal, any mark upon her name
could be fatal.</b>

42:18.510 --> 42:20.630
<b>You will join the court
of the French queen...</b>

42:20.810 --> 42:23.780
<b>...and stay there
until your father has forgiven you.</b>

42:29.880 --> 42:31.440
<b>You told them, didn't you?</b>

42:31.620 --> 42:34.550
<b>It was for your own good.
You never would have got away with it.</b>

42:34.720 --> 42:36.710
<b>It would have ruined your
prospects forever.</b>

42:36.890 --> 42:38.320
<b>For my good?</b>

42:38.490 --> 42:41.480
<b>Well, I'll try to remind myself of that
while I'm in exile.</b>

42:41.660 --> 42:43.560
<b>And you're here in the king's bed...</b>

42:43.730 --> 42:46.170
<b>...not challenged
for our father's affection...</b>

42:46.330 --> 42:48.600
<b>...that is was for my good
and not yours.</b>

42:48.770 --> 42:50.400
<b>Anne.</b>

42:52.340 --> 42:55.570
<b>You would be wise
to regard this as an opportunity.</b>

42:58.050 --> 43:01.410
<b>You are educated.
It's a chance I never had.</b>

43:02.280 --> 43:06.190
<b>Now go to France.
The queen of France is sophisticated.</b>

43:06.350 --> 43:11.350
<b>Be useful to her, amuse her.
She'll admire your spirit.</b>

43:11.530 --> 43:13.390
<b>Learn from her.</b>

43:13.560 --> 43:16.120
<b>Observe the ladies of the court.
See how they achieve...</b>

43:16.300 --> 43:19.700
<b>...what they want from their men,
not by stamping their little feet...</b>

43:19.870 --> 43:23.230
<b>...but by allowing the men to believe
that they, indeed, are in charge.</b>

43:24.340 --> 43:26.810
<b>That is the art of being a woman.</b>

45:09.310 --> 45:13.210
<b>Still shut, keep them shut.
Careful, careful.</b>

45:15.620 --> 45:18.780
<b>All right, now open.</b>

45:22.890 --> 45:25.480
<b>I am to become an earl,
your brother a viscount.</b>

45:25.660 --> 45:28.750
<b>In addition, we have received
a number of new grants and estates.</b>

45:28.930 --> 45:30.400
<b>So our debts are paid, and more.</b>

45:30.560 --> 45:35.470
<b>George, the king will arrange a match
between you and Jane Parker.</b>

45:38.540 --> 45:40.470
<b>I beg you, Father, no.</b>

45:41.010 --> 45:43.240
<b>I thought you had ambitions
for this family?</b>

45:43.780 --> 45:46.910
<b>The girl's well connected.
Her father is cousin to the king.</b>

45:47.080 --> 45:48.810
<b>Must I actually marry her?</b>

45:48.980 --> 45:51.710
<b>Of course you must marry her.
Have you no pride?</b>

45:51.890 --> 45:54.680
<b>Or would you rather
leave everything to Mary?</b>

45:58.660 --> 46:00.250
<b>No, sir.</b>

46:12.970 --> 46:15.870
<b>It'll be a wedding
attended by the king of England...</b>

46:16.040 --> 46:18.710
<b>...with all the greatest
lords of the land.</b>

46:18.880 --> 46:20.710
<b>Would a smile be too much to ask?</b>

46:20.880 --> 46:23.410
<b>What's there to smile about?</b>

46:23.580 --> 46:26.680
<b>I'm a mother with one child
ordered to marry a girl he hates...</b>

46:26.850 --> 46:28.720
<b>...another banished abroad
in disgrace...</b>

46:28.890 --> 46:33.690
<b>...and a third,
whoring in public with an adulterer.</b>

46:34.460 --> 46:37.290
<b>You say you're concerned
for her happiness.</b>

46:37.460 --> 46:39.800
<b>Will Mary be happy
when he leaves her?</b>

46:39.970 --> 46:42.060
<b>Because you know
that will happen in the end.</b>

46:42.240 --> 46:43.760
<b>Only God knows
how anything will end.</b>

46:43.940 --> 46:47.570
<b>God? He turned his back
on all this a long time ago.</b>

46:47.740 --> 46:51.300
<b>And these rooms, our new position?
Does none of my work please you?</b>

46:51.480 --> 46:57.710
<b>These gifts, this favor
will go as swiftly as it came.</b>

46:57.890 --> 47:00.380
<b>These rooms once belonged
to the duke of Buckingham...</b>

47:00.550 --> 47:05.250
<b>...the king's closest friend.
His head now rots on a spike.</b>

47:05.430 --> 47:06.550
<b>He committed treason.</b>

47:06.730 --> 47:08.130
<b>Treason? What is treason?</b>

47:08.300 --> 47:11.730
<b>Anything the king or his lawyers
decide it to be.</b>

47:12.970 --> 47:14.700
<b>On a whim.</b>

48:02.820 --> 48:04.550
<b>The baby lives.</b>

48:05.090 --> 48:06.920
<b>She's not miscarried.</b>

48:08.160 --> 48:10.350
<b>But for the sake of the child...</b>

48:10.760 --> 48:13.490
<b>...she must begin her lying-in,
immediately.</b>

48:50.030 --> 48:54.160
<b><i>Now that Mary is lying-in,
the king will no longer bed her.</i></b>

48:55.140 --> 48:59.440
<b>Out of compassion, he'll visit her
every day for, what, a week?</b>

48:59.610 --> 49:01.440
<b>The queen
will have his head spinning...</b>

49:01.610 --> 49:03.370
<b>...with pretty little Spanish things.</b>

49:03.540 --> 49:07.610
<b>Not to mention the Seymours
and that milky-faced girl of theirs.</b>

49:08.450 --> 49:12.110
<b>We must influence him in our favor
with whatever means we have.</b>

49:17.830 --> 49:18.850
<b>Yes?</b>

49:19.730 --> 49:20.920
<b>Well, l...</b>

49:21.100 --> 49:25.590
<b>- I was going to suggest Anne.
- You couldn't control that girl last time.</b>

49:25.770 --> 49:27.530
<b>What makes you think
a couple months...</b>

49:27.700 --> 49:30.100
<b>...in France
have made any difference?</b>

49:31.570 --> 49:36.130
<b>I receive regular reports
from the dowager queen.</b>

49:36.840 --> 49:40.440
<b>It seems that she's quite changed.</b>

49:46.020 --> 49:49.460
<b><i>And so you must return
as your uncle bids.</i></b>

49:51.020 --> 49:53.120
<b><i>You are to entertain the king...</i></b>

49:53.290 --> 49:56.420
<b><i>... and keep his mind on Mary
at all times.</i></b>

49:56.600 --> 50:00.120
<b><i>That is your task and no more.</i></b>

50:30.100 --> 50:31.330
<b>What's the noise?</b>

50:33.830 --> 50:37.960
<b>It's Mistress Boleyn, Your Grace.
Her stories of life at the French court.</b>

50:38.540 --> 50:40.340
<b>I'm aware of one Boleyn girl.</b>

50:40.910 --> 50:43.430
<b>But she's lying-in
with a certain child in her belly.</b>

50:45.380 --> 50:47.850
<b>Well, Boleyn girl...</b>

50:48.750 --> 50:49.980
<b>...show your face.</b>

50:58.890 --> 51:00.720
<b>What's so amusing?</b>

51:00.890 --> 51:04.590
<b>I was merely offering my thoughts
on the new French king.</b>

51:04.770 --> 51:09.330
<b>Who has such great power,
yet such meager authority as a man.</b>

51:11.970 --> 51:15.640
<b>- Continue.
- His pettiness is astounding.</b>

51:15.810 --> 51:18.570
<b>He will bear a mortal grudge
over the mildest of slights.</b>

51:18.750 --> 51:23.410
<b>Spoiled cub with a spike in its paw.
Riven with resentment.</b>

51:23.580 --> 51:26.140
<b>Unable to forgive or forget.</b>

51:27.120 --> 51:29.050
<b>A great king...</b>

51:29.790 --> 51:33.750
<b>...a great man,
rises above such things.</b>

51:35.130 --> 51:37.190
<b>And what would you know
of great men?</b>

51:37.730 --> 51:40.890
<b>I've read enough books
and heard enough talk...</b>

51:41.070 --> 51:45.470
<b>...to believe I'd know one
if he were before me.</b>

51:45.640 --> 51:50.870
<b>Then look about you.
I'm curious. Do you see one here?</b>

51:55.350 --> 51:57.210
<b>Looking, my lord.</b>

51:57.380 --> 51:59.610
<b>Still looking, my lord.</b>

52:02.720 --> 52:06.090
<b>There. Found one.</b>

52:09.060 --> 52:14.690
<b>So forgiveness, you say,
makes a man great. What else?</b>

52:15.900 --> 52:17.840
<b>Generosity.</b>

52:18.010 --> 52:19.770
<b>Humility.</b>

52:20.570 --> 52:23.240
<b>The ability to recognize
his match in others...</b>

52:23.410 --> 52:24.970
<b>...and not be threatened by it.</b>

52:25.910 --> 52:29.040
<b>- His match in other men?
- Women too.</b>

52:29.220 --> 52:30.480
<b>You believe that?</b>

52:30.650 --> 52:33.120
<b>That women can be
the match of men?</b>

52:33.290 --> 52:36.380
<b>It's a question women have asked
themselves for some time.</b>

52:36.560 --> 52:39.390
<b>But we concede
men do have some value.</b>

52:39.560 --> 52:41.490
<b>So we accept them as equal.</b>

52:45.130 --> 52:47.730
<b>I find you much changed,
Mistress Anne.</b>

52:48.200 --> 52:50.900
<b>Then my prayers
have been answered.</b>

52:53.340 --> 52:55.740
<b>Welcome back at court.</b>

52:58.080 --> 52:59.840
<b>My lord.</b>

53:02.720 --> 53:04.180
<b>What?</b>

53:04.350 --> 53:07.620
<b>I suppose he felt that
she'd been banished long enough.</b>

53:08.060 --> 53:11.050
<b>But in whose interest
do they imagine she'll act?</b>

53:11.220 --> 53:12.590
<b>Certainly not mine.</b>

53:14.900 --> 53:17.660
<b>Why do they make this room
such a dungeon?</b>

53:18.100 --> 53:20.000
<b>Does it have to be this dark?</b>

53:33.950 --> 53:37.110
<b>- Where were you?
- Just visiting Mary.</b>

53:38.790 --> 53:39.980
<b>As ever.</b>

53:40.450 --> 53:43.550
<b>Well, now that Anne's back,
you can be doubly jealous.</b>

53:44.490 --> 53:46.220
<b>I'm your wife.</b>

53:48.300 --> 53:50.420
<b>You never lie with me.</b>

54:06.210 --> 54:07.870
<b>Yes, it has.</b>

54:08.920 --> 54:11.410
<b>I hope you know what you're doing.</b>

54:11.990 --> 54:14.850
<b>These are vagabonds who'll stop
at nothing to take your money.</b>

54:15.020 --> 54:16.490
<b>We're not gambling, Your Grace.</b>

54:16.660 --> 54:19.420
<b>Mistress Boleyn
is reading our fortunes.</b>

54:21.830 --> 54:22.990
<b>Read mine.</b>

54:28.500 --> 54:30.530
<b>Another talent picked up in France?</b>

54:30.700 --> 54:34.230
<b>The queen offers her ladies
a broad education.</b>

54:34.940 --> 54:37.670
<b>Last I heard, she was entertaining
Lutherans and heretics.</b>

54:38.610 --> 54:42.410
<b>Scholars and philosophers, my lord,
escaping persecution.</b>

54:43.150 --> 54:45.640
<b>- I hope you kept your ears shut.
- I did.</b>

54:45.820 --> 54:49.850
<b>And a cross close to my heart
at all times.</b>

56:32.250 --> 56:36.280
<b>- From the king, Mistress Anne.
- Open it.</b>

56:37.930 --> 56:39.690
<b>Open it.</b>

56:56.980 --> 56:59.040
<b>Now send it back.</b>

57:03.550 --> 57:04.580
<b>You heard me.</b>

57:08.260 --> 57:09.920
<b>She did what?</b>

57:10.560 --> 57:12.960
<b>Sent it back, Your Grace.</b>

57:25.570 --> 57:26.970
<b>Anne.</b>

57:32.450 --> 57:36.540
<b>I meant to come sooner.
I'm sorry I did not.</b>

57:36.720 --> 57:38.910
<b>- I've been kept occupied.
- So I hear.</b>

57:39.450 --> 57:43.020
<b>- Amusing the king.
- Only that, sister. I assure you.</b>

57:43.190 --> 57:46.020
<b>- Despite his best efforts.
- What? And not yours?</b>

57:51.530 --> 57:53.160
<b>How is it?</b>

57:54.100 --> 57:56.300
<b>The child is strong.</b>

57:56.940 --> 58:00.600
<b>It gives me no rest. Like his father.</b>

58:02.880 --> 58:06.310
<b>Do you feel as awful as you look?
You know, in France...</b>

58:06.480 --> 58:09.010
<b>...no woman would allow herself
to get in such a state.</b>

58:09.180 --> 58:12.050
<b>Why did you come, Anne,
if all you desire is to torment me?</b>

58:12.550 --> 58:17.220
<b>Perhaps now you know how it feels
to be deceived by your sister.</b>

58:17.690 --> 58:20.320
<b>- I did nothing.
- You stole the king away.</b>

58:20.500 --> 58:22.690
<b>And then you betrayed me
over Henry Percy.</b>

58:22.860 --> 58:24.960
<b>If that's what you think,
tell yourself that.</b>

58:25.130 --> 58:29.970
<b>I did, sister. Every day
and every night I was in exile.</b>

58:35.240 --> 58:37.910
<b>A gift from the king.</b>

58:39.150 --> 58:41.140
<b>Give it to my sister.</b>

58:42.350 --> 58:44.410
<b>It's for you, Mistress Anne.</b>

58:45.550 --> 58:47.080
<b>Me?</b>

58:47.460 --> 58:50.890
<b>Then send it back. Immediately.</b>

58:54.760 --> 58:56.420
<b>How dare he?</b>

58:58.600 --> 59:00.230
<b>You see...</b>

59:01.000 --> 59:03.300
<b>...I have your interests at heart.</b>

59:03.470 --> 59:04.670
<b>Why?</b>

59:05.970 --> 59:08.240
<b>Why this cruelty?</b>

59:09.380 --> 59:11.170
<b>You know I love him.</b>

59:12.750 --> 59:15.010
<b>Well, perhaps you should stop.</b>

59:42.310 --> 59:44.040
<b>Your Grace.</b>

59:44.750 --> 59:46.410
<b>Your daughter. Where is she?</b>

59:47.950 --> 59:49.310
<b>Leave us.</b>

59:51.220 --> 59:53.080
<b>Where is she?</b>

59:54.160 --> 59:55.820
<b>Which one?</b>

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:02.460
<b>Your Grace, which one?</b>

1:00:04.970 --> 1:00:07.060
<b>- Anne.
- Your Grace?</b>

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.530
<b>- You received my gifts?
- Yes.</b>

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:12.970
<b>- And? They did not please you?
- On the contrary, my lord.</b>

1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:14.440
<b>They pleased me greatly.</b>

1:00:14.610 --> 1:00:16.510
<b>Why do you insult me
by returning them?</b>

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:18.740
<b>Because you insult me
by sending them at all.</b>

1:00:18.910 --> 1:00:21.180
<b>My sister lies in bed with your child.</b>

1:00:21.350 --> 1:00:24.220
<b>If you wish to please me, sir,
send her the gifts you send me.</b>

1:00:24.390 --> 1:00:27.080
<b>I have shown Mary
enough kindness and generosity.</b>

1:00:27.260 --> 1:00:30.050
<b>Now it pleases me
to show you some.</b>

1:00:33.530 --> 1:00:38.190
<b>I beg you, my lord, do not do this.
What has changed so?</b>

1:00:38.370 --> 1:00:40.660
<b>You. You have changed.</b>

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:44.460
<b>How could I forget? You chose Mary
above me when we first met.</b>

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:48.630
<b>No, Anne. Yours was the only face
I saw in the crowd that day.</b>

1:00:48.810 --> 1:00:51.640
<b>And what I wouldn't give
to go back to that day, my lord.</b>

1:00:51.810 --> 1:00:55.810
<b>Have my chance again.
But it's too late.</b>

1:00:55.980 --> 1:01:02.080
<b>And I would never betray my sister.
Now I beg you, leave me.</b>

1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:04.920
<b>- This is too difficult to bear.
- You see?</b>

1:01:05.090 --> 1:01:09.360
<b>The same pain as mine.
Proof you feel the same way.</b>

1:01:09.530 --> 1:01:11.970
<b>Perhaps, but since it can never
come to...</b>

1:01:12.130 --> 1:01:15.970
<b>No, let me decide that.
Allow me hope.</b>

1:01:17.770 --> 1:01:18.860
<b>Leave me.</b>

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:10.120
<b>- Does the king know?
- He's been told.</b>

1:02:18.730 --> 1:02:21.700
<b>- Any moment, Your Grace.
- How is she?</b>

1:02:22.270 --> 1:02:26.470
<b>Brave and strong. All may be well.</b>

1:03:02.710 --> 1:03:07.170
<b>Anne. Have you considered
what I asked? Is there hope?</b>

1:03:07.350 --> 1:03:08.750
<b>How could I ever trust you...</b>

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.480
<b>...when I've seen
how you betrayed first your wife...</b>

1:03:11.650 --> 1:03:13.480
<b>...now my sister?</b>

1:03:47.060 --> 1:03:52.860
<b>I vow I will never lie with my wife,
nor speak to your sister again.</b>

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:55.900
<b>Just allow me to hope.</b>

1:04:01.270 --> 1:04:02.630
<b>A boy.</b>

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:06.000
<b>I will take care of Mary
and the child.</b>

1:04:06.170 --> 1:04:07.770
<b>Your Grace.</b>

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:10.810
<b>A son.</b>

1:04:12.980 --> 1:04:14.510
<b>A son.</b>

1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:29.590
<b>Very well, my lord.</b>

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.570
<b>You may have hope.</b>

1:04:39.810 --> 1:04:41.070
<b>My one true love.</b>

1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:55.250
<b>My lord.</b>

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:04.420
<b>My lord.</b>

1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:21.380
<b>Damn you.
Not a single detail was left to chance.</b>

1:05:21.380 --> 1:05:24.370
<b>Damn you.
Not a single detail was left to chance.</b>

1:05:24.550 --> 1:05:28.780
<b>- In the moment of our greatest glory...
- Glory? What glory?</b>

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.550
<b>A mistress gave a man a bastard.
No more.</b>

1:05:31.730 --> 1:05:33.350
<b>A male bastard. A son.</b>

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:35.620
<b>The queen may yet
give birth to a son.</b>

1:05:35.830 --> 1:05:37.960
<b>The queen no longer bleeds.</b>

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:44.430
<b>- Can you be sure?
- One of her physicians.</b>

1:05:44.610 --> 1:05:46.440
<b>The moment this family
provides a son...</b>

1:05:46.610 --> 1:05:48.580
<b>...he turns his back on it
on your account.</b>

1:05:48.740 --> 1:05:51.230
<b>You better have a plan,
and that plan had better work.</b>

1:05:51.410 --> 1:05:54.070
<b>- Or what, uncle?
- Enough.</b>

1:05:55.450 --> 1:05:57.150
<b>Both of you.</b>

1:05:59.790 --> 1:06:00.850
<b>And what about Mary?</b>

1:06:02.020 --> 1:06:04.580
<b>And her child? Or have we forgotten
about them already?</b>

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:08.020
<b>Mary and her bastard child
will go back to the country.</b>

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:11.630
<b>It is the king's wish, and mine.</b>

1:06:12.530 --> 1:06:14.130
<b>Very well.</b>

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:17.300
<b>And you can be the one to tell her.</b>

1:06:17.710 --> 1:06:19.940
<b>I think you've earned that privilege.</b>

1:06:45.030 --> 1:06:47.370
<b>How can you show your face
in here?</b>

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.060
<b>My own sister.</b>

1:06:57.210 --> 1:06:58.870
<b>Take care.</b>

1:06:59.410 --> 1:07:01.680
<b>Because he'll only do to you
what he's done to me.</b>

1:07:02.380 --> 1:07:04.910
<b>You should not have given yourself
so lightly.</b>

1:07:05.090 --> 1:07:06.880
<b>These are the consequences.</b>

1:07:07.590 --> 1:07:10.750
<b>I gave myself to a man I loved.</b>

1:07:11.530 --> 1:07:15.590
<b>- And he loved me.
- A man's love is worthless.</b>

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:18.430
<b>Our mother succumbed to love.
Look what it got her.</b>

1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:20.330
<b>A feeble husband.</b>

1:07:21.100 --> 1:07:24.230
<b>Love is of no value
without power and position.</b>

1:07:25.210 --> 1:07:28.870
<b>If I give the king a son,
he will not bear the name "bastard."</b>

1:07:34.350 --> 1:07:36.910
<b>What you suggest is treason.</b>

1:07:37.090 --> 1:07:39.920
<b>He cannot marry you.
He has his queen.</b>

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:43.210
<b>Who cannot produce a male heir.</b>

1:07:43.990 --> 1:07:48.930
<b>- You've reached too high, as always.
- The king will deal with Katherine.</b>

1:07:49.100 --> 1:07:52.260
<b>You'll hear about it
from where I'm sending you.</b>

1:07:52.770 --> 1:07:54.960
<b>You are to go back to Rochford.</b>

1:07:56.070 --> 1:07:58.560
<b>Isn't that what you always wanted?</b>

1:07:58.740 --> 1:08:03.700
<b>A life in the country,
alone with your child.</b>

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.370
<b>Peter, over here.
Fetch my lady's leg-warmer.</b>

1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:10.940
<b>Your sister is gone, as you wished.</b>

1:09:11.110 --> 1:09:13.010
<b>Will you give yourself to me now?</b>

1:09:13.180 --> 1:09:16.280
<b>No. When you are loyal to me
above all others.</b>

1:09:16.450 --> 1:09:18.510
<b>- But I am.
- No, you are loyal to the queen...</b>

1:09:18.690 --> 1:09:20.050
<b>...above all others.</b>

1:09:20.220 --> 1:09:23.660
<b>- I barely see Katherine.
- But she sits on a throne beside you.</b>

1:09:23.830 --> 1:09:27.020
<b>- Your right hand in matters of state.
- For appearances' sake only.</b>

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:32.330
<b>Still, she is your queen.
And ever present.</b>

1:09:33.630 --> 1:09:35.970
<b>I feel her eyes on me.</b>

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:39.200
<b>And those of her spies.</b>

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:45.310
<b>Look at us. Forever reduced
to meeting in secret like this...</b>

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.810
<b>...speaking in whispers.
Hardly conducive to passion.</b>

1:09:50.380 --> 1:09:52.350
<b>Well, what would you have me do?</b>

1:09:55.090 --> 1:09:58.790
<b>We must now find a legal way
around this instantly.</b>

1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:01.490
<b>The only way forward
is by legal means.</b>

1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:07.460
<b>I don't care! I need to be rid of her.
Find a reason.</b>

1:10:08.570 --> 1:10:12.510
<b>Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans
to send the queen to a nunnery.</b>

1:10:12.670 --> 1:10:15.040
<b>This will leave you all alone in court.</b>

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:18.180
<b>Queen in all but name.</b>

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:25.610
<b>Is this assurance enough for you?
Will you give yourself to me now?</b>

1:10:26.490 --> 1:10:28.320
<b>My lord.</b>

1:10:28.790 --> 1:10:31.160
<b>I desire nothing more.</b>

1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:34.560
<b>But as long
as we remain unmarried...</b>

1:10:34.730 --> 1:10:37.290
<b>...any child I gave you
would be dubbed "bastard."</b>

1:10:37.470 --> 1:10:40.560
<b>And I a whore.
Do you really wish that for me?</b>

1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:44.540
<b>What alternative is there?
Katherine is my wife.</b>

1:10:44.810 --> 1:10:45.970
<b>I really do not know...</b>

1:10:46.140 --> 1:10:49.340
<b>...why we waste our time
talking of convents...</b>

1:10:49.510 --> 1:10:52.450
<b>...when you could simply
annul the marriage.</b>

1:10:57.250 --> 1:10:59.050
<b>Then you...</b>

1:10:59.690 --> 1:11:01.850
<b>...my sweet lord...</b>

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:04.960
<b>...will be free to remarry.</b>

1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:10.730
<b>And I could give myself to you fully...</b>

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.590
<b>...give you everything you desire.</b>

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:13.180
<b>- Mary Talbot.
- Who?</b>

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:17.060
<b>Mary Talbot, Henry Percy's bride.
Leave us.</b>

1:12:20.300 --> 1:12:21.700
<b>She has petitioned the king...</b>

1:12:21.870 --> 1:12:25.000
<b>...demanding a divorce
from her husband on the grounds...</b>

1:12:25.170 --> 1:12:28.770
<b>...that his prior betrothal to you
was actually consummated.</b>

1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:30.570
<b>I knew this would come to haunt us.</b>

1:12:30.950 --> 1:12:33.350
<b>- I must go to the king.
- He doesn't want to see you.</b>

1:12:33.510 --> 1:12:36.180
<b>He doesn't want to hear a word.
He won't even talk to me.</b>

1:12:36.350 --> 1:12:37.820
<b>The only Boleyn he'll talk to...</b>

1:12:37.990 --> 1:12:41.550
<b>...the only person whose testimony
he will trust, is Mary.</b>

1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.460
<b>Then bring her here. Now.</b>

1:12:54.070 --> 1:12:56.760
<b>You asked to see me, Your Majesty?</b>

1:12:57.740 --> 1:13:01.570
<b>The queen is to be tried
to test the validity of our marriage.</b>

1:13:02.780 --> 1:13:05.870
<b>Before I subject a good woman
to such an ordeal...</b>

1:13:06.050 --> 1:13:07.340
<b>...I need to be satisfied...</b>

1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:11.350
<b>...that the woman I'm replacing
her with is beyond reproach.</b>

1:13:12.190 --> 1:13:15.090
<b>This charge that Anne
and Henry Percy...</b>

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:17.120
<b>...consummated their marriage...</b>

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:22.150
<b>...she denies it ever happened,
but I need to be certain.</b>

1:13:26.300 --> 1:13:28.030
<b>Can I trust her?</b>

1:13:30.070 --> 1:13:31.900
<b>Why would you not?</b>

1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:36.140
<b>Usually, my instincts are sharp.</b>

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.280
<b>But with your sister...</b>

1:13:40.210 --> 1:13:42.440
<b>...she has a power over me.</b>

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:53.220
<b>I'm asking you because I trust you.</b>

1:13:53.460 --> 1:13:55.790
<b>And because I believe,
perhaps mistakenly...</b>

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:57.990
<b>...that you care for me.</b>

1:13:59.170 --> 1:14:01.730
<b>And that you would put a matter
of this importance...</b>

1:14:01.900 --> 1:14:03.770
<b>...before family ambition.</b>

1:14:18.750 --> 1:14:20.910
<b>I want to thank you
for what you did today.</b>

1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:26.750
<b>I am forever in your debt.</b>

1:14:26.990 --> 1:14:28.620
<b>You owe me nothing.</b>

1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.060
<b>I did it as a peace offering
between us...</b>

1:14:33.230 --> 1:14:37.530
<b>...so we may finally draw a line
beneath everything.</b>

1:14:37.710 --> 1:14:40.540
<b>Well, then let it be exactly that.</b>

1:14:41.940 --> 1:14:45.110
<b>A new start between us,
here at court.</b>

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.270
<b>Thank you,
but I must return to the country.</b>

1:14:47.450 --> 1:14:49.440
<b>You would leave me here alone...</b>

1:14:49.950 --> 1:14:52.540
<b>...when the queen is going on trial?</b>

1:14:52.850 --> 1:14:54.010
<b>Out of the question.</b>

1:14:56.590 --> 1:14:57.780
<b>Out of the question?</b>

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:01.990
<b>Stay here with me.</b>

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:04.660
<b>Please.</b>

1:15:05.470 --> 1:15:08.800
<b>I need my sister here by my side.</b>

1:15:24.890 --> 1:15:26.320
<b>Crowds are with her.</b>

1:15:26.490 --> 1:15:28.580
<b>The crowds have no vote...</b>

1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:31.660
<b>...and the bishops that do
are in Wolsey's pocket.</b>

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:35.360
<b>She's coming towards us.</b>

1:15:40.170 --> 1:15:41.260
<b>So...</b>

1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:43.230
<b>...the Boleyn whores.</b>

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.570
<b>Two former ladies of mine.</b>

1:15:46.110 --> 1:15:47.470
<b>What did I do to upset you...</b>

1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:49.700
<b>...that you should turn against me
like this?</b>

1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:53.110
<b>- You failed to give England an heir.
- And that upsets you so?</b>

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:56.270
<b>- What upsets the king upsets me.
- How dare you?</b>

1:15:57.690 --> 1:16:01.250
<b>Katherine, queen of England,
come to court.</b>

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:04.050
<b>You want me to creep away
and become a nun?</b>

1:16:04.230 --> 1:16:06.190
<b>Well, I shall not.</b>

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:07.830
<b>You want me to lie before God...</b>

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.760
<b>...and admit my first marriage
was consummated?</b>

1:16:10.930 --> 1:16:12.490
<b>Well, it was not.</b>

1:16:12.670 --> 1:16:15.460
<b>You want me to retire
and give up my daughter's claim...</b>

1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:17.830
<b>...as sole rightful heir to the throne?</b>

1:16:18.010 --> 1:16:21.170
<b>Well, I shall not.
Not in a thousand years.</b>

1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:24.940
<b>Not if you rack me
to within an inch of my life.</b>

1:16:25.810 --> 1:16:30.580
<b>I am Katherine, queen of England,
the king's one true wife...</b>

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:32.950
<b>...and mother
of the heir to the throne.</b>

1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:36.280
<b>Beloved of the people,
and beloved of a king...</b>

1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:38.950
<b>...you have bewitched.</b>

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:11.690
<b>My lord, how have I offended you?</b>

1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:14.330
<b>I have been a true, obedient wife.</b>

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:18.630
<b>I have loved all those whom you loved
and given you children...</b>

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:21.130
<b>...though it has pleased God
to take them away.</b>

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:25.000
<b>If there is any just cause
against me...</b>

1:17:25.170 --> 1:17:28.870
<b>...I will happily depart to my shame
and dishonor...</b>

1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:33.170
<b>...but I tell you, as God is my witness,
there is none.</b>

1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:39.440
<b>So I beg you, dear husband,
to spare me this humiliation.</b>

1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:43.180
<b>But if you will not...</b>

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:46.550
<b>...and you wish to challenge
the validity of our marriage...</b>

1:17:46.730 --> 1:17:52.220
<b>...then let it be in a proper court
and by the only authority I recognize.</b>

1:17:53.270 --> 1:17:57.600
<b>His Holiness himself, the Pope.</b>

1:18:12.350 --> 1:18:14.340
<b>- It's a disaster.
- Why?</b>

1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:18.150
<b>If the trial continues, the bishops
will still find in the king's favor.</b>

1:18:18.330 --> 1:18:21.690
<b>Yes, but without the endorsement
of the Pope, the result will be hollow.</b>

1:18:21.860 --> 1:18:23.690
<b>The people will never support it.</b>

1:18:23.860 --> 1:18:25.960
<b>Why does the king
give Rome such power?</b>

1:18:26.130 --> 1:18:28.500
<b>He should simply take matters
into his own hands...</b>

1:18:28.670 --> 1:18:30.530
<b>...and annul the marriage.</b>

1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:35.640
<b>No, that would mean breaking
with the Catholic Church.</b>

1:18:35.810 --> 1:18:39.370
<b>- His faith would never allow that.
- Nor his good sense.</b>

1:18:39.550 --> 1:18:42.450
<b>Breaking with Rome
would isolate England politically...</b>

1:18:42.620 --> 1:18:45.020
<b>...and leave us
at the mercy of the Protestants.</b>

1:18:45.190 --> 1:18:48.520
<b>But the alternative is leaving England
without a male heir...</b>

1:18:48.690 --> 1:18:50.450
<b>...and risking civil war.</b>

1:18:50.620 --> 1:18:53.350
<b>The very thing Henry fears most.</b>

1:18:55.430 --> 1:18:57.690
<b>Somehow,
I need to make him understand...</b>

1:18:57.870 --> 1:18:59.590
<b>...that this will be worth it...</b>

1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:03.900
<b>...when I am his queen
and give him a son.</b>

1:19:09.940 --> 1:19:11.840
<b>I know you.</b>

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:16.480
<b>You have decided
but it grieves you.</b>

1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:21.290
<b>Will you destroy your marriage,
your country, your soul before God...</b>

1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:25.360
<b>...on the whim of one girl
because she denies you?</b>

1:19:25.530 --> 1:19:28.090
<b>Because she tortures you
with her refusal?</b>

1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:31.790
<b>You think she doesn't know
exactly what she's doing?</b>

1:19:31.970 --> 1:19:35.160
<b>She wants me to step aside.</b>

1:19:35.340 --> 1:19:37.830
<b>Where is my wise husband?</b>

1:19:38.310 --> 1:19:40.170
<b>Where is he?</b>

1:19:41.310 --> 1:19:43.400
<b>You are a king...</b>

1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:47.740
<b>...so be one.</b>

1:20:27.020 --> 1:20:28.890
<b>Now you will give yourself to me.</b>

1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:33.620
<b>I thought I had made myself clear.
Until we're married, there's no ques...</b>

1:20:33.790 --> 1:20:35.660
<b>Damn you!</b>

1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:39.230
<b>I have torn this country apart
for you!</b>

1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:41.730
<b>For which you should thank me,
not be angry.</b>

1:20:41.900 --> 1:20:42.930
<b>Broken with Rome.</b>

1:20:43.100 --> 1:20:45.770
<b>Freed yourself from the decadence
of a corrupt Church.</b>

1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:48.170
<b>I've got rid of a good woman
in the queen.</b>

1:20:48.340 --> 1:20:51.470
<b>A husk who failed you, whose Spanish
blood shackles you to Rome.</b>

1:20:51.650 --> 1:20:53.370
<b>For which I will be excommunicated.</b>

1:20:53.550 --> 1:20:56.910
<b>And instead,
become head of a new church...</b>

1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:59.350
<b>...the Church of England.
Closer to God.</b>

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:01.990
<b>- Silence! Damn you.
- Let go of me.</b>

1:21:02.460 --> 1:21:04.080
<b>You're hurting me.</b>

1:21:05.890 --> 1:21:08.050
<b>You'll show me
it was worth my while.</b>

1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.000
<b>How was he with you?</b>

1:21:46.370 --> 1:21:50.670
<b>He was tender, surprisingly so.</b>

1:23:00.670 --> 1:23:03.910
<b>Witch! Witch! Witch!</b>

1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:06.010
<b>They're calling me a witch.</b>

1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:09.640
<b>It will all pass
when they see how he adores you.</b>

1:23:09.820 --> 1:23:11.310
<b>Adores me?</b>

1:23:22.730 --> 1:23:25.460
<b>Mary. Mary.</b>

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:28.200
<b>Mary, wait.</b>

1:23:29.300 --> 1:23:32.860
<b>I must tell you. I'm leaving court
and your father's employment.</b>

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.100
<b>I've seen enough.</b>

1:23:36.380 --> 1:23:38.070
<b>You and I both.</b>

1:23:40.010 --> 1:23:42.380
<b>I've saved some money.</b>

1:23:42.550 --> 1:23:47.280
<b>It's not much,
but it's enough to keep you.</b>

1:23:47.690 --> 1:23:49.750
<b>To keep you safe.</b>

1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:53.550
<b>I have my eye on a place in Tatton,
near where I grew up, in the west.</b>

1:23:53.730 --> 1:23:55.850
<b>- Stafford.
- If you came with me...</b>

1:23:56.030 --> 1:23:58.430
<b>...I would never betray you
or take you for granted.</b>

1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:00.230
<b>It's impossible, you know that.</b>

1:24:00.700 --> 1:24:03.330
<b>- My family would never allow it.
- And you would care...</b>

1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:06.370
<b>...what they think,
after everything they've done to you?</b>

1:24:27.690 --> 1:24:32.790
<b>Just one more. Just one more.
Push. One more.</b>

1:24:32.970 --> 1:24:35.900
<b>Come on, Anne. Push, push.</b>

1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:39.930
<b>It's done. It's done, Your Majesty.</b>

1:24:40.110 --> 1:24:42.010
<b>Well done.</b>

1:24:55.420 --> 1:24:57.050
<b>What is it?</b>

1:24:57.620 --> 1:24:59.720
<b>What is it?</b>

1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:17.900
<b>It's a girl.</b>

1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:22.540
<b>A beautiful healthy girl.</b>

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:26.450
<b>A girl?</b>

1:26:16.140 --> 1:26:21.730
<b>She has named her Elizabeth,
after your mother.</b>

1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:28.410
<b>- Is the child healthy?
- Perfectly, sir.</b>

1:26:41.330 --> 1:26:43.890
<b>Well,
if we can have a healthy daughter...</b>

1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:46.260
<b>...we can have a healthy son.</b>

1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:10.780
<b>Who's he with?</b>

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:18.320
<b>- Jane Seymour.
- No.</b>

1:27:22.700 --> 1:27:25.330
<b>- How could he do this to me?
- Anne, you need rest.</b>

1:27:25.510 --> 1:27:28.200
<b>If I do not produce a son,
who will help me?</b>

1:27:28.380 --> 1:27:30.840
<b>Without a boy, he will pass me over.</b>

1:27:31.010 --> 1:27:33.070
<b>I will not let him.</b>

1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.120
<b>Elizabeth.</b>

1:27:43.290 --> 1:27:45.590
<b>- How dare you?
- There now.</b>

1:27:46.190 --> 1:27:48.320
<b>- Humiliate me like this?
- Stop.</b>

1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:50.590
<b>- Why don't you just admit it?
- Enough!</b>

1:27:51.260 --> 1:27:53.230
<b>There's a girl. There now, quiet.</b>

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.370
<b>- I tell you, it's not true.
- Liar.</b>

1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:57.800
<b>- Leave me.
- I can smell the whore on you.</b>

1:27:57.970 --> 1:28:00.410
<b>Get away from me. You disgust me.</b>

1:28:00.570 --> 1:28:02.170
<b>Quiet.</b>

1:28:06.310 --> 1:28:10.080
<b>I struck him today.
What am I doing?</b>

1:28:10.250 --> 1:28:13.880
<b>I'm destroying it all on my own.
I can't sleep.</b>

1:28:14.050 --> 1:28:17.290
<b>- Without sleep, I cannot think.
- Anne.</b>

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:20.830
<b>It's getting more and more difficult
to arouse him.</b>

1:28:21.430 --> 1:28:24.590
<b>Some nights, he cannot do it.</b>

1:28:24.970 --> 1:28:28.870
<b>I have to resort
to evermore degrading...</b>

1:28:29.670 --> 1:28:31.360
<b>He hates himself in the morning.</b>

1:28:32.170 --> 1:28:34.770
<b>He hates me
for what I made him do.</b>

1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:39.810
<b>It's slipping away and it's my fault.</b>

1:28:40.610 --> 1:28:42.100
<b>It's my fault.</b>

1:28:55.130 --> 1:28:56.290
<b>The queen is with child.</b>

1:29:04.940 --> 1:29:07.270
<b>Anne, that's wonderful.</b>

1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:10.230
<b>Take care now.</b>

1:29:17.050 --> 1:29:20.420
<b>The queen is with child
but the situation is delicate.</b>

1:29:20.590 --> 1:29:26.180
<b>So your concern has just cause
but keep your counsel for now.</b>

1:29:26.930 --> 1:29:28.720
<b>This pregnancy is precarious.</b>

1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:32.700
<b>If it is a boy,
then the Boleyns will be untouchable.</b>

1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:37.900
<b>But if it is a girl or a stillborn...</b>

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.240
<b>...then they and everyone
connected with them will perish.</b>

1:29:41.410 --> 1:29:43.040
<b>And that includes you.</b>

1:29:43.210 --> 1:29:46.340
<b>So you and I need to work together,
Jane.</b>

1:30:04.860 --> 1:30:08.300
<b>I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.</b>

1:30:09.100 --> 1:30:10.570
<b>Just a bad dream.</b>

1:30:13.370 --> 1:30:16.000
<b>You fetch my brother and sister,
will you?</b>

1:30:56.180 --> 1:30:57.910
<b>I lost it.</b>

1:31:00.550 --> 1:31:03.020
<b>Almost without pain.</b>

1:31:04.090 --> 1:31:06.220
<b>And so quickly...</b>

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:09.890
<b>...as if it never was.</b>

1:31:15.500 --> 1:31:17.230
<b>Get rid of it.</b>

1:31:17.400 --> 1:31:22.100
<b>Bury it. Get rid of it somehow.
On the fire with it.</b>

1:32:11.260 --> 1:32:13.350
<b><i>I feel his eyes on me.</i></b>

1:32:13.530 --> 1:32:17.520
<b><i>Staring at me,
wondering why I do not show.</i></b>

1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:18.990
<b><i>You haven't told him?</i></b>

1:32:20.770 --> 1:32:24.860
<b>Well, soon the truth will be out,
that I cannot bear children.</b>

1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:29.770
<b>He will have me burned as a witch.</b>

1:32:30.210 --> 1:32:33.200
<b>But there's still time.
You could yet fall pregnant.</b>

1:32:33.380 --> 1:32:35.710
<b>He won't lie with me
and risk damaging the child...</b>

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:38.010
<b>...he believes I'm carrying.</b>

1:32:38.690 --> 1:32:39.880
<b>No.</b>

1:32:45.530 --> 1:32:46.920
<b>Must I spell it out?</b>

1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:51.900
<b>But lying with another man
would be treason.</b>

1:33:04.040 --> 1:33:06.100
<b>Stop it. Anne, it's madness.</b>

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.040
<b>No, don't you see?
You're my only hope.</b>

1:33:08.210 --> 1:33:09.980
<b>- I can't listen, it's monstrous.
- Mary.</b>

1:33:10.150 --> 1:33:13.480
<b>- No. Come, George.
- George, please?</b>

1:33:14.250 --> 1:33:16.690
<b>My life depends on it.</b>

1:33:22.830 --> 1:33:25.530
<b>May God have mercy on you both.</b>

1:34:29.700 --> 1:34:34.100
<b>I can't. I'm so sorry.</b>

1:34:35.170 --> 1:34:37.690
<b>I just can't. I just...</b>

1:34:39.770 --> 1:34:42.430
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

1:34:45.910 --> 1:34:48.280
<b>I'll tell the king in the morning.</b>

1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:52.710
<b>Let's pray he takes pity on me.</b>

1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:01.420
<b>I saw them. The two of them.</b>

1:35:06.130 --> 1:35:07.530
<b>Yes?</b>

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.000
<b>Fetch my belongings
and bring them to Rochford.</b>

1:35:27.850 --> 1:35:32.720
<b>Your Grace.
Lady Rochford is here to see you.</b>

1:35:34.590 --> 1:35:36.030
<b>Not now.</b>

1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:40.600
<b>She has news of her husband,
George Boleyn, and the queen.</b>

1:35:45.100 --> 1:35:46.400
<b>What is it?</b>

1:36:34.750 --> 1:36:36.520
<b>I couldn't help it, my lord.</b>

1:36:37.820 --> 1:36:40.920
<b>- I beg you, have mercy on me.
- You witch.</b>

1:36:41.090 --> 1:36:44.500
<b>- No, my lord.
- You cursed, evil witch.</b>

1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:45.760
<b>Why?</b>

1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:47.990
<b>He came early.</b>

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:50.830
<b>Our son.</b>

1:36:51.900 --> 1:36:54.400
<b>- There's no blame in that.
- No.</b>

1:36:55.310 --> 1:36:57.870
<b>Then what? What else have I done?</b>

1:36:58.040 --> 1:36:59.340
<b>Guards.</b>

1:36:59.510 --> 1:37:01.710
<b>- My lord?
- Guards!</b>

1:37:08.090 --> 1:37:10.180
<b>Please, please.
No, spare me, please.</b>

1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:12.450
<b>Please.
Please, I beg you, spare me.</b>

1:37:12.630 --> 1:37:15.360
<b>I've done nothing wrong.
Please, no.</b>

1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:34.940
<b>My children. My children.</b>

1:37:43.020 --> 1:37:46.360
<b>Look what you have done.</b>

1:38:38.570 --> 1:38:42.170
<b>It's a sad day for England when nobles
do not rise for their queen.</b>

1:38:42.810 --> 1:38:44.900
<b>And even sadder
when that same queen...</b>

1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:48.340
<b>...is charged with adultery
and incest.</b>

1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:55.150
<b>Charged is not convicted, uncle.
Or is it in this court?</b>

1:38:57.530 --> 1:39:01.620
<b>Master Cromwell,
read out the indictment.</b>

1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:07.400
<b>The charge is that in the 28th year
of the reign of our sovereign Henry...</b>

1:39:07.570 --> 1:39:10.830
<b>...king of England, his wife,
the queen...</b>

1:39:11.370 --> 1:39:14.500
<b>...being seduced by the Devil...</b>

1:39:15.910 --> 1:39:20.510
<b>...did knowingly commit incest,
high treason...</b>

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:23.310
<b>...and offenses against God.</b>

1:39:23.820 --> 1:39:25.290
<b>How do you plead?</b>

1:39:26.250 --> 1:39:28.590
<b>Not guilty, my lord.</b>

1:39:31.830 --> 1:39:36.630
<b><i>The love I have for my brother
is the natural love any sister...</i></b>

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:39.230
<b><i>... would have for someone
with whom she's grown up...</i></b>

1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:43.700
<b><i>... nursed when sick,
played with as a child.</i></b>

1:39:45.170 --> 1:39:48.870
<b>Judge me, my lords,
but never forget...</b>

1:39:49.740 --> 1:39:56.210
<b>...your verdicts will be judged by God
in the greatest court of all.</b>

1:39:56.850 --> 1:40:02.310
<b>My lords,
the time has come to pass judgment.</b>

1:40:12.930 --> 1:40:15.370
<b>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</b>

1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:18.470
<b>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</b>

1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:21.270
<b>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</b>

1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:26.610
<b>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</b>

1:40:27.250 --> 1:40:30.220
<b>- Guilty.
- Guilty.</b>

1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:32.550
<b>Guilty.</b>

1:40:37.460 --> 1:40:38.790
<b>Guilty.</b>

1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:03.780
<b>No, no, no.</b>

1:41:03.950 --> 1:41:06.320
<b>No, no, no!</b>

1:41:07.790 --> 1:41:09.880
<b>Please, please,
you must believe me.</b>

1:41:10.060 --> 1:41:11.820
<b>You must believe me.</b>

1:41:11.990 --> 1:41:17.590
<b>I've done nothing, please.
Please, My Grace.</b>

1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:27.060
<b>The Lord is my shepherd.
And thy kingdom will be free...</b>

1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:30.440
<b>...to meet in green pastures and
he leadeth me to a great lord.</b>

1:41:30.610 --> 1:41:32.880
<b>He quicken my soul,
he bringeth me in the path...</b>

1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:49.350
<b>Leave us.</b>

1:41:52.830 --> 1:41:54.800
<b>All of you.</b>

1:42:05.780 --> 1:42:07.650
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

1:42:08.550 --> 1:42:11.610
<b>I'm told I'm too late for my brother,
George.</b>

1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:16.110
<b>I beg you.</b>

1:42:17.090 --> 1:42:19.220
<b>Spare my sister.</b>

1:42:20.090 --> 1:42:23.220
<b>I understand she has offended you.
You wish to replace her as queen.</b>

1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:25.630
<b>But must she die?</b>

1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:28.030
<b>She has been tried
and found guilty.</b>

1:42:29.570 --> 1:42:31.540
<b>You could send her away.
No one would know.</b>

1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:33.670
<b>Why are you here for her?</b>

1:42:34.740 --> 1:42:37.580
<b>You have put yourself at great risk.</b>

1:42:39.350 --> 1:42:41.750
<b>Because she's my sister...</b>

1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:45.050
<b>...and therefore one half of me.</b>

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:49.860
<b>And I would do nothing...</b>

1:42:50.020 --> 1:42:52.220
<b>...to hurt any part of you.</b>

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.490
<b>Go.</b>

1:43:54.890 --> 1:43:56.550
<b>We didn't.</b>

1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:59.420
<b>George and I, we...</b>

1:44:06.700 --> 1:44:08.790
<b>The guards are letting them in.</b>

1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:11.030
<b>You'll be spared.</b>

1:44:11.210 --> 1:44:13.140
<b>The king as good
as gave me his word.</b>

1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:16.780
<b>He saw you?</b>

1:44:22.020 --> 1:44:24.780
<b>They say he's with Jane Seymour
now.</b>

1:44:25.750 --> 1:44:26.780
<b>Is it true?</b>

1:44:28.690 --> 1:44:30.020
<b>No.</b>

1:44:32.390 --> 1:44:34.290
<b>Thank you.</b>

1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:37.100
<b>A generous lie.</b>

1:44:41.670 --> 1:44:43.760
<b>Will you hold me?</b>

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:47.040
<b>You'll look after Elizabeth?</b>

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.800
<b>It won't come to that, I promise.</b>

1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:52.840
<b>I promise.</b>

1:44:53.950 --> 1:44:55.510
<b>He'll keep his word.</b>

1:44:55.680 --> 1:44:57.980
<b>I know he will.</b>

1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:18.260
<b>Masters.</b>

1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:22.470
<b>I here humbly submit to the law...</b>

1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:25.930
<b>...as the law has judged me.</b>

1:46:28.810 --> 1:46:31.070
<b>As for my offenses...</b>

1:46:31.910 --> 1:46:33.850
<b>...God knows them.</b>

1:46:34.110 --> 1:46:36.080
<b>And I remit them to God...</b>

1:46:36.250 --> 1:46:39.480
<b>...beseeching him
to have mercy on my soul.</b>

1:46:41.190 --> 1:46:43.420
<b>I beseech Jesus...</b>

1:46:43.590 --> 1:46:45.080
<b>...save my sovereign...</b>

1:46:45.630 --> 1:46:48.320
<b>...and master, the king.</b>

1:46:48.500 --> 1:46:49.720
<b>The goodli...</b>

1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:52.330
<b>The goodliest...</b>

1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:53.660
<b>...and gentlest master...</b>

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:56.800
<b>...there ever was.</b>

1:47:00.070 --> 1:47:02.040
<b>My lady.</b>

1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:14.350
<b><i>Mary, you risked your life
coming to court...</i></b>

1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:17.180

<b><i>And may God have mercy

1:48:16.580 --> 1:48:19.920
<b>Sweet Jesus,
I commend my soul to thee.</b>

1:49:21.820 --> 1:49:24.700
<b>Mother, hand me the child.</b>
