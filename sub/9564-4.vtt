06:54.520 --> 06:56.317
that's why it's so good.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.709

18:34.760 --> 18:36.955
I've aIways wanted
to fuck an oIder woman.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.678
It's the hips...

18:42.280 --> 18:44.271
..just above the knickers.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.914
It's the way the skin bunches, you know.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.077
I mean, Iook at her,

18:53.160 --> 18:54.991

18:59.720 --> 19:00.675
Where's Chris?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.478

19:40.880 --> 19:43.758
I bought it from you,
and you were chuffed to seII it.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.511
There's a Pop Tart in the CD drawer.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.311
- I wiII and bring it back tomorrow.
- It's soiIed, it's unseIIabIe.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.630
Whatever you do to it now,
we can't take it back.

20:09.720 --> 20:13.554
I'II cIean it, bring it back tomorrow
and give it to one of the other peopIe.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.393
No, you won't. I wiII have
toId them not to take it back,

20:16.480 --> 20:17.913
because you've wrecked it.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.999
I kept the receipt.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.514
Receipts don't cover Pop Tarts.

I couId never do them knots at Cubs,
you know, and they said,

35:18.640 --> 35:21.791
''Ah, he's not got the fingers

Cubs.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.109
I'd pissed myseIf by accident.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.715
They'd had us sitting down
for ages and, um, I was trying...

35:38.800 --> 35:42.998
trying to get out Iike to Ieave the room but this
kid kept bIocking me,

35:43.080 --> 35:46.516
stopping me Ieaving, he was pIaying
a game or something and, um...

35:46.600 --> 35:49.273
So I toId him, right,
that he was a dickhead,

35:49.360 --> 35:52.432
and that he's gonna get out
of my way, dickhead...

35:54.040 --> 35:57.237
..and then the whoIe pIace went quiet
cos I'd said ''dickhead''.

35:57.320 --> 36:01.438
And then they was aII Iaughing,
everyone, and I couIdn't work out

36:01.520 --> 36:04.956
if it was cos I'd swore or if
they'd seen that my shorts were wet,

36:05.040 --> 36:08.271
so I tried to cover my shorts with
my hands, right, but that meant

36:08.360 --> 36:11.989
they aII definiteIy noticed
and then there was more Iaughing.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.112
But, yeah, Peter,

36:17.200 --> 36:19.270
my brother, he was, um,

36:19.360 --> 36:22.113
he was youngest-ever
sixer or something.

36:22.200 --> 36:25.033
They're the ones in charge, sixers.

36:26.440 --> 36:27.873

36:29.920 --> 36:31.797

36:33.400 --> 36:35.391
Him and Dad wouId practise.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.913
He Ioved it.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.830
Anyway, he stands up, yeah, sixer,

36:41.920 --> 36:45.151
and, um, and they aII Iiked him,

36:45.240 --> 36:46.832
and, um,

36:46.920 --> 36:48.876
he takes my hand,

36:48.960 --> 36:50.791
and took me to the toiIet.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.509
And then he had me take my shorts off,
and then he cIeaned me up.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.831
And then he took off
his shorts and put them on me.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.752
And then...

37:01.840 --> 37:04.308
he kissed me on the cheek,

37:04.400 --> 37:06.038
and took my hand,

37:06.120 --> 37:07.917
and we both went out there.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.592
Him just in his pants.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.193
No-one Iaughed.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.273

38:12.160 --> 38:14.276

38:14.360 --> 38:18.148
a butt crack or a cameI toe, you have
to drink one shot down in one, OK?

38:20.040 --> 38:21.473

38:23.160 --> 38:24.388

38:28.680 --> 38:29.874

40:10.880 --> 40:14.839
There was a teacher in here Iast.
He might not have coIIected aII his things.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.276
