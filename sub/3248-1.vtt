01:09.700 --> 01:10.990
Good morning, Adipose Industries.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.380
Donna Noble, Health and Safety.

01:23.510 --> 01:24.720
John Smith, Health and Safety.

01:26.410 --> 01:27.590
Adipose Industries.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.130
The 21st century way to lose weight.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.560
No exercise, no diet, no pain.

01:35.030 --> 01:40.070
Just lifelong freedom from fat, the Holy Grail of the modern age.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.550
And here it is.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.020
You just take one capsule.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.110
One capsule, once a day, for three weeks.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.890
And the fat, as they say...

01:51.920 --> 01:53.910
'The fat just walks away.'

01:54.460 --> 01:56.710
'Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I could?'

01:57.420 --> 01:59.890
I am Penny Carter, Science Correspondent for the Observer.

02:00.820 --> 02:04.640
There are a thousand diet pills in the market,
a thousand conmen stealing people's money.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.900
How do we know the fat isn't going
straight into your bank account?

02:08.100 --> 02:11.980
Oh, Penny.  If cynicism burnt up calories,
we'd all be thin as rakes.

02:13.420 --> 02:16.970
But if you want the science, I can oblige.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.420
'Adipose Industries.

02:21.260 --> 02:28.390
'The Adipose Capsule is composed of a synthesised mobilising lipase,
bound to a large protein molecule.

02:29.220 --> 02:35.280
'The mobilising lipase breaks up the triglycerides
stored in the Adipose cells, which then...'

02:35.950 --> 02:36.770
Health and Safety.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.460
Film department.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.820
100% legal, 100% effective.

02:44.110 --> 02:47.420
But can I just ask, how many people
have taken the pills to date?

02:49.930 --> 02:55.080
We've already got one million customers
within the Greater London area alone.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.160
But from next week, we start rolling out nationwide.

03:00.070 --> 03:02.300
The future starts here.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.410
And Britain will be thin.

03:08.490 --> 03:10.330
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

03:10.330 --> 03:11.060
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.790
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

03:13.220 --> 03:14.540
Good morning, I represent Adipose Industries.

03:18.830 --> 03:22.930
That's a three-week course of pills for
the special price of Â£45.

03:27.590 --> 03:30.750
We deliver within three working days.

03:31.570 --> 03:35.310
The box comes with 21 days' worth of pills,
a full information pack,

03:35.720 --> 03:39.760
and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.420
It's made of 18-carat gold,
and it's yours for free.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.390
No, we don't give away pens. Sorry.

03:47.350 --> 03:49.040
No, I can't make an exception, no.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.350
I'll need to keep this for testing.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.670
And I just need a list of your customers.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.530
Could you print it off?

03:54.920 --> 03:55.640
I suppose so.

03:56.400 --> 03:56.990
Where's the printer?

03:57.640 --> 03:58.790
Just over there, by the plant.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.640
Which plant, that plant?

04:01.430 --> 04:02.200
Yeah, that's the one.

04:02.580 --> 04:03.190
Lovely.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.190
That's the printer there?

04:04.310 --> 04:04.990
- By the plant, yeah.
- Really?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.180
Does it need a code?
Last place I worked, the printer needed a code.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.300
No, I can do it from here.

04:10.220 --> 04:10.960
Has it got paper?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.380
Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.110
Excuse me, everyone.

04:14.510 --> 04:16.050
If I could have your attention.

04:19.070 --> 04:22.160
On average, you're each selling 40 Adipose packs per day.

04:22.550 --> 04:24.050
It's not enough.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.660
I want 100 sales per person, per day.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.870
And if not, you'll be replaced.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.900
Cos if anyone's good at trimming the fat, it's me.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.260
Now.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.120
Back to it.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.290
Anyway, if you could print that off, thanks.

04:44.690 --> 04:46.740
So if you could print off that list,
I'll get out of your way.

04:48.140 --> 04:48.900
Lovely.

04:49.240 --> 04:49.920
Thanks, then.

04:49.920 --> 04:50.940
- See you!
- Thanks, then.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.580
Ooh, what's that?

04:53.090 --> 04:53.990
My telephone number.

04:54.270 --> 04:55.780
- What for?
- Health and Safety.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.060
You be health.  I'll be safety.

05:00.590 --> 05:03.770
But that contravenes paragraph 5, subsection C.

05:04.180 --> 05:04.730
Sorry.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.660
Me again!

05:18.560 --> 05:19.240
Stacy Campbell?

05:19.660 --> 05:20.270
Who wants to know?

05:20.700 --> 05:26.200
My name's Donna.  I represent Adipose Industries,
and you're on the list of our valued customers.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.690
Mr Roger Davey!

05:28.890 --> 05:32.000
I'm calling on behalf of Adipose Industries.
Just need to ask you a few questions.

05:32.230 --> 05:32.930
It's been fantastic.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.610
I started the pills on Thursday.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.180
Five days later, I've lost 11 pounds.

05:38.210 --> 05:41.110
And no side effects or anything?

05:41.480 --> 05:42.740
No, I feel fantastic.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.790
It's a new lease of life.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.200
Now what do you think about these earrings, do they work?

05:46.820 --> 05:47.860
Yeah, lovely.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.010
I've been on the pills two weeks now.
I've lost 14 kilos.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.780
The same amount every day?

05:54.210 --> 05:55.300
One kilo exactly.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.340
You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight.

05:58.110 --> 06:01.490
Well, technically speaking,
it's gone by ten past one in the morning.

06:02.770 --> 06:03.440
What makes you say that?

06:04.290 --> 06:05.840
That's when I get woken up.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.890
Might as well weigh myself at the same time!

06:09.050 --> 06:09.740
Are you going on a date?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.350
I'm doing the opposite.  I'm dumping him!

06:12.700 --> 06:13.520
I can do better than him now.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.050
Right, I won't be long.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.470
If the taxi beeps, give me a shout.

06:18.690 --> 06:19.810
It is driving me mad.

06:20.660 --> 06:27.660
Ten minutes past one, every night, bang on the dot without fail,
the burglar alarm goes off.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.940
I've had experts in, I've had it replaced,
I've even phoned Watchdog.

06:31.940 --> 06:32.480
But no!

06:32.570 --> 06:35.030
Ten past one in the morning, off it goes.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.680
- But with no burglars?
- Nothing!

06:37.040 --> 06:37.770
I've given up looking.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.870
Tell me, Roger.
Have you got a cat flap?

06:42.320 --> 06:43.420
It was here when I bought the house.

06:44.020 --> 06:44.830
I've never bothered with it.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.680
I'm not a cat person.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.550
No, I've met cat people.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.280
You're nothing like them.

06:50.790 --> 06:51.630
Is that what it is?

06:51.740 --> 06:53.010
Cats getting inside the house?

06:54.070 --> 06:59.110
Well, the thing about cat flaps is they don't just let things in,
they let things out as well.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.520
Like what?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.920
The fat just walks away.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.080
Won't be long!

07:08.480 --> 07:09.150
That's all right.

07:48.350 --> 07:49.860
We have unscheduled parthenogenesis.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.210
Well, thanks for your help.

07:52.610 --> 07:55.060
Tell you what, maybe you could lay off
the pills for a week or so.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.690
Gotta go, sorry!

08:02.940 --> 08:03.950
Send out the Collection Squad.

08:05.000 --> 08:05.880
Bring them home.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.930
You all right up there?

08:24.080 --> 08:24.780
Yeah.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.260
The Adipose has been witnessed.

08:32.539 --> 08:35.460
'Activating full parthenogenesisl

08:58.930 --> 08:59.860
What are you?

09:01.410 --> 09:02.350
What are you?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.020
I like what you've done with the hall.

09:06.310 --> 09:06.950
Stacy?

09:10.470 --> 09:11.240
Are you all right?

09:14.570 --> 09:15.760
I wouldn't mind a little visit myself.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.710
Everything all right in there?

09:25.240 --> 09:25.960
It's only me.

09:27.090 --> 09:28.160
Do you mind if I pop to the loo?

09:29.990 --> 09:30.770
Stacy?

09:34.660 --> 09:35.280
Help me!

09:35.700 --> 09:36.810
Oh, my God, help me!

09:37.270 --> 09:37.980
What is it? What's wrong?

09:40.870 --> 09:41.580
Stacy!

11:28.660 --> 11:29.400
Stacy Campbell?

11:29.980 --> 11:31.600
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

11:32.990 --> 11:33.930
She'sjust gone.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.420
Oh, great.  Thanks for nothing.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.920
It seems we have a case of industrial espionage.

12:03.650 --> 12:06.720
One touch and the capsule bio-tunes itself to its owner,

12:06.740 --> 12:10.790
but someone must have introduced a second, raw capsule.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.990
Therefore, one of these people is a thief.

12:16.860 --> 12:17.590
There!

12:19.400 --> 12:20.890
Oh, yes.  There she is.

12:21.830 --> 12:22.590
Now...

12:27.120 --> 12:28.120
What shall we do with her?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.310
And what time's this?

12:40.500 --> 12:41.340
How old am I?

12:42.860 --> 12:44.350
Not old enough to use a phone.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.650
I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks.

12:49.160 --> 12:49.830
Look at you!

12:50.640 --> 12:52.880
You're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the dole.

12:53.600 --> 12:59.760
It's no good sitting there dressed up looking
like you're job-hunting, you've got to do something.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.830
It's not like the 1980s.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.540
No-one's unemployed these days, except you.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.610
How long did that job with Health and Safety last?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.920
Two days, and then you walk out.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.050
'I have other plans.'

13:14.010 --> 13:15.040
Well, I've not seen them.

13:15.750 --> 13:20.860
And it's no good sitting there dreaming, no-one's gonna come along
with a magic wand and make your life all better.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.030
Where's Grandad?

13:24.380 --> 13:25.260
Where d'you think he is?

13:26.060 --> 13:28.610
Up the hill!
He's always up the hill!

13:35.830 --> 13:36.700
Here comes trouble.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.160
Permission to board ship, sir.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.200
Permission granted.

13:41.810 --> 13:42.490
Was she nagging you?

13:43.440 --> 13:43.970
Big time.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.860
Brought you a Thermos.

13:46.220 --> 13:46.880
Oh, ta.

13:48.120 --> 13:48.750
You seen anything?

13:49.340 --> 13:55.010
Yeah, I've got Venus, with an apparent magnitude of minus 3.5.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.170
At least, that's what it says in my little book.

13:57.980 --> 13:58.950
Here, come and see. Come on.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.120
Here you go.

14:01.950 --> 14:02.550
Right?

14:04.750 --> 14:08.750
That's the only planet in the solar system named after a woman.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.180
Good for her.

14:13.460 --> 14:14.310
How far away is that?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.810
It's about 26 million miles.

14:18.940 --> 14:21.140
But we'll get there one day.

14:22.230 --> 14:25.160
100 years' time, we'll be striding out amongst the stars,

14:26.400 --> 14:29.000
jiggling about with all them aliens, just you wait.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.180
You really believe in all that stuff, don't you?

14:34.650 --> 14:35.950
They're all over the place these days.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.930
If I wait here long enough...

14:38.990 --> 14:40.530
Don't suppose you've seen a little blue box?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.300
Is that slang for something?

14:44.060 --> 14:46.450
No, I mean it.

14:47.500 --> 14:53.060
If you ever see a little blue box flying up there in the sky,
you shout for me, Gramps.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.550
Oh, you just shout.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.030
D'you know, I don't understand half the things you say these days.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.800
- Nor me.
- No, fair dos.

15:07.070 --> 15:08.710
You've had a funny old time of it lately.

15:10.030 --> 15:12.640
There was poor old what's-his-name, Lance, bless him.

15:13.930 --> 15:15.250
That barmy old Christmas.

15:17.770 --> 15:19.480
I wish you'd tell us what really happened.

15:20.550 --> 15:21.380
I know.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.100
It's just...

15:24.970 --> 15:25.840
The things I've seen.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.040
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.130
I mean, even tonight, I was in a...

15:33.930 --> 15:34.540
Doesn't matter.

15:35.950 --> 15:37.440
Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that.

15:39.090 --> 15:41.150
You just...You seem to be drifting, sweetheart.

15:42.280 --> 15:42.930
I'm not drifting.

15:45.470 --> 15:46.180
I'm waiting.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.740
- What for?
- The right man.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.850
Same old story.

15:54.490 --> 15:55.420
A man!

15:56.110 --> 15:57.790
No, I don't mean like that.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.210
But he's real.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.870
I've seen him.  I've met him.
Just once.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.920
And then I let him fly away.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.480
Well, there you are.  Go and find him.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.930
I've tried.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.730
He's nowhere.

16:15.310 --> 16:16.280
Not like you to give up.

16:17.850 --> 16:22.550
I remember when you was about six years old,
your mother said, 'No holiday this year.'

16:23.100 --> 16:27.170
So off you toddled all on your own, and you got on a bus to Strathclyde!

16:28.390 --> 16:30.340
We had the police out and everything!

16:32.100 --> 16:33.090
Where's she gone, then?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.020
Where's that girl?

16:37.860 --> 16:38.500
You're right.

16:40.830 --> 16:42.950
Cos he's still out there, somewhere.

16:45.040 --> 16:45.920
And I'll find him, Gramps.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.650
Even if I have to wait 100 years...

16:51.790 --> 16:52.590
I'll find him.

16:57.890 --> 16:59.190
Oh, fascinating.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.840
Seems to be a bioflip digital stitch, specifically for...

17:24.300 --> 17:26.650
It's my turn for the car.
What do you need it for?

17:28.010 --> 17:29.070
A quick get away.

18:10.550 --> 18:11.120
Morning!

18:34.850 --> 18:36.290
Keep an eye out.  She'll come back.

18:37.770 --> 18:40.070
And then she's mine.

18:50.590 --> 18:51.850
See you tomorrow!

19:16.680 --> 19:17.960
Not now!
I need the car.

19:18.130 --> 19:18.880
Where are you?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.130
I can't. I'm busy.

19:21.350 --> 19:22.260
Why are you whispering?

19:22.850 --> 19:23.850
I am in church.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.130
What are you doing in church?

19:28.080 --> 19:28.590
Praying.

19:29.370 --> 19:30.210
Bit late for that, madam.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.020
What is she in church for?

19:32.020 --> 19:33.510
Hush, you!  Go up the hill.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.960
But I need the car.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.040
I'm going out with Suzette.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.040
She's asked all the Wednesday girls.
Apparently she's been on those Adipose pills.
She says she looks marvellous.

19:49.950 --> 19:53.650
We know you're in here, so why don't you make
this nice and easy and show yourself?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.720
I'm waiting.

19:59.710 --> 20:01.410
I warn you, I'm not a patient woman.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.080
Now, out you come.

20:04.410 --> 20:08.550
Right, we'll do it the hard way.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.610
Get her!

20:21.580 --> 20:23.060
There you are.

20:25.230 --> 20:29.090
I've been through the records, Foster,
and all of your results have been faked.

20:29.350 --> 20:31.490
There's something about those pills
you're not telling us.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.780
Oh, I think I'll be conducting this interview, Penny.

21:00.610 --> 21:01.780
You've got no right to do this.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.120
Let me go!

21:18.550 --> 21:20.510
This is ridiculous.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.140
Sit there.

21:25.510 --> 21:26.650
I'm phoning my editor.

21:26.650 --> 21:27.850
I said sit.

21:30.010 --> 21:31.650
'You can't tie me up!'

21:31.650 --> 21:33.420
What sort of a country do you think this is?

21:33.420 --> 21:36.440
Oh, it's a beautifully fat country.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.950
I've travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.960
So come on, then, Miss Foster.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.310
Those pills, what are they?

21:45.310 --> 21:48.860
Well, you might as well have a scoop,
since you'll never see it printed.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.100
This is the spark of life.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.090
And what's that supposed to mean?

21:57.090 --> 22:01.710
Officially, the capsule attracts
all the fat cells and flushes them away.

22:01.710 --> 22:02.860
Well, it certainly attracts them.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.910
That part's true.

22:05.140 --> 22:08.830
But it binds the fat together
and galvanises it to form a body.

22:08.830 --> 22:11.170
Well, what do you mean 'a body'?

22:11.170 --> 22:13.480
I am surprised you never asked about my name.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.230
I chose it well.

22:16.730 --> 22:20.810
Foster, as in foster mother.

22:22.260 --> 22:24.210
And these...

22:26.880 --> 22:28.560
are my children.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.190
You're kidding me.

22:30.590 --> 22:32.450
What the hell is that?

22:32.450 --> 22:34.250
Adipose.

22:35.930 --> 22:40.670
It's called an Adipose.

22:40.670 --> 22:43.760
Made out of living fat.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.920
Are we interrupting you?

24:01.580 --> 24:02.840
Get her!

24:04.870 --> 24:06.350
And him!

24:32.300 --> 24:34.160
What about me?

24:41.770 --> 24:45.910
Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

24:45.910 --> 24:47.690
You've even got the same suit.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.110
Don't you ever change?

24:50.110 --> 24:52.360
Yeah, thanks Donna, not right now.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.090
Just like old times!

25:01.280 --> 25:03.000
Cos I thought, 'How do you find the Doctor?'

25:03.000 --> 25:05.570
Then I thought, 'Look for trouble, and he'll turn up.'

25:05.570 --> 25:11.100
I looked everywhere, you name it - UFO sightings,
crop circles, sea monsters...

25:11.100 --> 25:12.230
I found them all.

25:12.230 --> 25:15.510
Like the bees disappearing,
I thought, 'He's connected.'

25:15.510 --> 25:18.710
Cos the thing is, Doctor,
I believe it all now.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.150
You opened my eyes.

25:20.150 --> 25:22.960
All those amazing things out there,
I believe them all.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.610
Apart from that replica of the Titanic flying over Buckingham Palace.

25:26.610 --> 25:27.910
That's a hoax.

25:27.910 --> 25:29.620
What do you mean, the bees are disappearing?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.780
That's what it says on the internet.

25:31.780 --> 25:36.080
There were conspiracy theories about Adipose Industries,
so I thought I'd look.

25:36.080 --> 25:36.940
In you get!

25:36.940 --> 25:38.030
- What, in that thing?
- Yes, in that thing!

25:38.030 --> 25:41.490
But they'll just call us back up again.

25:41.490 --> 25:43.130
I've locked the controls with a sonic cage.

25:43.130 --> 25:44.750
Only I can control it.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.220
Not unless she's got a sonic device.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.920
Which is very unlikely.

25:48.490 --> 25:50.100
Out of my way.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.390
Oh, I don't think so.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.220
Come on.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.030
We can get in through the window.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.590
Deadlock the building.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.670
Can't get it open!

26:42.960 --> 26:44.630
We'll smash it, then!

26:59.340 --> 27:01.910
She's cutting the cable!

27:06.090 --> 27:07.590
Donna!

27:09.090 --> 27:10.520
Doctor!

27:10.740 --> 27:12.270
Hold on!

27:12.270 --> 27:14.190
I am!

27:21.820 --> 27:23.730
Doctor!

27:27.040 --> 27:29.290
And now for the other one.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.060
I'm going to fall!

28:05.780 --> 28:07.810
What the hell is going on?

28:08.780 --> 28:10.640
This is all your fault.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.390
I should've stayed at home!

28:13.390 --> 28:15.120
I won't be a minute!

28:21.800 --> 28:23.760
Yes, he's slippery, that one.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.120
Time we found out who he is.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.950
Is anyone gonna tell me what's going on?

28:40.950 --> 28:41.900
You a journalist?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.100
Yes.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.580
Well, make it up.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.700
Get off!

28:46.700 --> 28:47.630
I've got you.

28:47.630 --> 28:48.590
I've got you.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.580
Stop kicking!

28:56.520 --> 28:57.920
I was right.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.410
It's always like this with you, innit?

28:59.410 --> 29:00.280
Oh, yes!

29:00.280 --> 29:01.880
And off we go!

29:04.430 --> 29:05.680
- Oi!
- Sorry!

29:07.700 --> 29:10.150
Now do yourself a favour, get out.

29:15.270 --> 29:16.810
Well, then.

29:18.650 --> 29:20.500
At last.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.220
Hello.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.860
Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.

29:22.860 --> 29:23.980
And I'm Donna.

29:23.980 --> 29:25.520
Partners in crime.

29:26.110 --> 29:30.320
And evidently off-worlders, judging by your sonic technology.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.520
Oh, yes!

29:31.520 --> 29:33.880
I've still got your sonic pen.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.190
Nice! I like it.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.990
Sleek, it's kind of sleek.

29:36.990 --> 29:38.280
Oh, it's definitely sleek.

29:38.280 --> 29:41.980
And if you were to sign your real name,
that would be?

29:41.980 --> 29:45.710
Matron Cofelia, of the Five-Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.360
Intergalactic Class.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.010
A wet nurse.

29:49.260 --> 29:51.850
Using humans as surrogates.

29:51.850 --> 29:58.050
I've been employed by the Adiposian first family to foster
a new generation after their breeding planet was lost.

29:58.050 --> 30:00.190
How do you lose a planet?

30:00.190 --> 30:02.370
Oh, the politics are none of my concern.

30:02.370 --> 30:05.850
I'm just here to take care of the
children on behalf of the parents.

30:05.850 --> 30:08.040
What, like an outer space Supernanny?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.760
Yes, if you like.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.740
So.

30:11.740 --> 30:15.520
So those little things,
they're made out of fat, yeah?

30:15.520 --> 30:18.540
But that woman, Stacy Campbell,
there was nothing left of her.

30:18.540 --> 30:23.230
Oh, in a crisis, the Adipose can convert
bone and hair and internal organs.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.410
Makes them a little bit sick, poor things.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.420
What about poor Stacy?

30:29.420 --> 30:33.240
Seeding a level five planet is against galactic law.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.420
Are you threatening me?

30:36.920 --> 30:39.110
I'm trying to help you, Matron.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.770
This is your one chance.

30:41.770 --> 30:46.470
Cos if you don't call this off,
then I'll have to stop you.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.230
I hardly think you can stop bullets.

30:49.230 --> 30:50.790
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:50.790 --> 30:52.930
One more thing - before dying.

30:52.930 --> 30:57.900
Do you know what happens if you hold two
identical sonic devices against each other?

30:59.250 --> 31:00.070
No.

31:00.070 --> 31:00.960
Nor me.  Let's find out.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.190
DEAFENING BLEEPING

31:09.000 --> 31:10.400
Come on!

31:13.600 --> 31:15.650
I'm advancing the birth plan.

31:15.650 --> 31:17.650
We're going into premature labour.

31:19.810 --> 31:21.860
Cellular bossification.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.620
Tie her up.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.600
Oh, you're kidding me.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.240
That's one solution.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.500
Hide in a cupboard.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.980
I like it!

31:43.180 --> 31:44.200
I've been hacking into this all day,

31:44.200 --> 31:48.570
cos the Matron's got a computer core running
through the building, triple-deadlocked.

31:48.570 --> 31:51.680
But now I've got this, I can get into it.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.970
What does that thing do?

31:59.330 --> 32:01.030
It's the inducer.

32:01.890 --> 32:04.010
We had planned to seed millions.

32:04.780 --> 32:08.080
But if that man's an alien and
he's alerted the Shadow Proclamation,

32:08.080 --> 32:11.260
then the first one million humans will have to do.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.720
Find him, and the woman.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.880
Don't waste time, just kill them.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.540
She's wired up the whole building.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.190
And we need a bit of privacy.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.710
Just enough to stun them.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.110
But why's she wired up a tower block?

32:31.110 --> 32:33.150
What's it all for?

32:40.790 --> 32:43.140
'Inducer online.'

32:46.310 --> 32:47.810
You look older.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.250
Thanks.

32:49.980 --> 32:51.140
Still on your own?

32:51.140 --> 32:52.390
Yep.

32:52.750 --> 32:53.930
Well, no.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.210
I had this friend. Martha, she was called.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.300
Martha Jones. She was brilliant.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.700
And I destroyed half her life.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.550
But she's fine, she's good.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.200
She's gone.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.010
What about Rose?

33:11.010 --> 33:12.590
Still lost.

33:13.970 --> 33:16.380
I thought you were gonna travel the world.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.860
Easier said than done.

33:19.610 --> 33:23.150
It's like, I had that one day
with you and I was gonna change.

33:23.150 --> 33:25.450
I was gonna do so much.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.680
And then I woke up the next morning, same old life.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.500
It's like you were never there.

33:35.350 --> 33:38.450
And I tried, I did try.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.630
I went to Egypt.

33:39.630 --> 33:41.820
I was gonna go barefoot and everything.

33:43.110 --> 33:45.810
Then it's all bus trips and guidebooks
and don't drink the water,

33:45.810 --> 33:48.340
and two weeks later, you're back at home.

33:50.190 --> 33:51.850
It's nothing like being with you.

33:53.310 --> 33:55.050
I must've been mad, turning down that offer.

33:55.050 --> 33:56.460
What offer?

33:57.230 --> 33:58.770
To come with you.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.530
You're coming with me?

34:01.970 --> 34:03.680
Oh, yes, please!

34:05.070 --> 34:06.570
Right.

34:06.570 --> 34:08.739
'Inducer activated.'

34:08.739 --> 34:09.870
What's it doing now?

34:09.870 --> 34:11.690
She's started the program.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.300
'Inducer transmitting.'

34:15.300 --> 34:18.030
Mark the date, Miss Carter.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.949
Happy birthday.

34:21.260 --> 34:25.520
One million birthdays.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.620
I swear, that Adipose treatment is fabulous.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.510
Just look at my chin.

34:33.949 --> 34:36.989
And it's very good for back fat.
I'm down two sizes.

34:36.989 --> 34:38.739
It's like a miracle.

34:38.739 --> 34:41.090
All that from just one little pill.

34:41.090 --> 34:42.900
And I've been eating like normal.

34:45.429 --> 34:46.310
You all right, love?

34:46.310 --> 34:49.469
Yeah, I'm just.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.360
Funny sort of feeling, like it's...

34:53.360 --> 34:54.510
What's happened?

34:54.510 --> 34:55.460
I'm not sure.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.840
It just seems to be...

34:56.840 --> 34:59.680
Better pop to the loo.

35:00.850 --> 35:03.110
- Oh, my God, Suzette!
- What?

35:07.970 --> 35:09.040
What is it?

35:09.700 --> 35:11.490
Get it off me!

36:17.450 --> 36:19.580
Come to me, children.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.190
Come to me.

36:22.790 --> 36:25.460
Everyone get back, don't touch them.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.550
So far they're just losing weight,

36:37.550 --> 36:39.800
but the Matron's gone up to emergency parthenogenesis.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.020
And that's when they convert?

36:41.020 --> 36:42.870
Skeletons, organs, everything.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.490
A million people are gonna die!

36:53.310 --> 36:55.030
Gotta cancel the signal.

36:56.230 --> 36:57.850
This contains the primary signal.

36:57.850 --> 37:00.560
If I can switch it off,
the fat goes back to being just fat.

37:01.290 --> 37:02.930
A nice try.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.910
Double strength.

37:05.780 --> 37:08.340
'Inducer increasing.'

37:08.340 --> 37:09.650
No, no, no, no, no, she's doubled it, I need...

37:10.580 --> 37:11.900
Haven't got time.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.870
It's too far.  I can't override it.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.860
They're all gonna die!

37:19.380 --> 37:21.220
Is there anything I can do?

37:21.220 --> 37:22.720
Sorry, this is way beyond you.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.590
Gotta double the base pulse.  I can't...

37:24.590 --> 37:26.890
Doctor, tell me, what do you need?

37:26.890 --> 37:29.890
I need a second capsule to boost the override,
but I've only got the one.

37:29.890 --> 37:31.610
I can't save them!

37:50.740 --> 37:52.490
It's stopped.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.610
They've gone.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.450
What's happened?

38:14.160 --> 38:17.850
I think the Doctor happened.

38:18.650 --> 38:22.180
But we've still given birth to 10,000 Adipose.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.060
And the Nursery is coming.

38:28.010 --> 38:29.700
What the hell was that?

38:29.700 --> 38:33.230
It's my lift home.

38:38.390 --> 38:40.640
You can't just leave me here!

38:41.750 --> 38:43.570
It just stopped.

38:46.820 --> 38:50.020
What on earth is it now?

38:51.020 --> 38:53.420
Oh, my god.

39:19.370 --> 39:20.820
Fine.

39:20.820 --> 39:23.480
When you say 'nursery',
you don't mean a crÃªche in Notting Hill?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.430
Nursery ship.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.470
'Incoming signal.'

39:32.480 --> 39:34.300
Hadn't we better go and stop them?

39:34.840 --> 39:38.220
Instructions from the Adiposian first family.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.900
Children!

39:41.000 --> 39:43.640
Oh, my children, behold.

39:44.210 --> 39:47.780
I am taking you home.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.510
Far across the galaxy, your new mummies
and daddies are waiting.

39:53.510 --> 39:56.120
And you will fly!

40:00.070 --> 40:02.360
Up you go, babies.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.360
Up you go!

40:08.010 --> 40:11.230
That's it, fly away home!

40:11.400 --> 40:14.930
She's wired up the tower block to
convert it into a levitation post.

40:19.450 --> 40:22.220
We're not the ones in trouble now.

40:22.930 --> 40:24.530
She is!

40:28.900 --> 40:30.760
Take me.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.240
The children need me!

40:44.250 --> 40:46.150
What you gonna do, then?

40:46.440 --> 40:47.740
Blow them up?

40:47.740 --> 40:48.420
They're just children.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.410
They can't help where they came from.

40:50.410 --> 40:52.900
That makes a change from last time.

40:53.850 --> 40:56.090
That Martha must've done you good.

40:57.790 --> 40:59.630
Ah, she did.

40:59.630 --> 41:02.720
Yeah, yeah, she did.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.540
She fancied me.

41:05.820 --> 41:07.510
Mad Martha, that one.

41:07.510 --> 41:08.340
Blind Martha.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.930
Charity Martha.

41:15.850 --> 41:18.020
I'm waving at fat.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.920
Actually, as a diet plan, it sort of works.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.360
There she is!

41:27.110 --> 41:29.360
Matron Cofelia, listen to me!

41:29.360 --> 41:31.650
Oh, I don't think so, Doctor.

41:31.650 --> 41:34.480
And if I never see you again, it'll be too soon.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.620
Why does no-one ever listen?

41:35.620 --> 41:36.600
I'm trying to help!

41:36.600 --> 41:37.920
Just get across to the roof.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.340
Can you shift the levitation beam?

41:39.340 --> 41:42.160
What, so that you can arrest me?

41:42.160 --> 41:46.790
I saw the Adiposian instructions -
they know it's a crime, breeding on Earth.

41:46.790 --> 41:48.570
So what's the one thing they want to get rid of?

41:48.570 --> 41:50.170
Their accomplice!

41:50.170 --> 41:52.820
I'm far more than that.

41:52.820 --> 41:57.790
I'm nanny to all these children.

41:57.790 --> 42:02.050
Exactly!  Mum and Dad have got the kids now.
They don't need the nanny anymore.

42:29.250 --> 42:31.170
Oi, you two!

42:31.170 --> 42:32.790
You're just mad.

42:32.790 --> 42:33.930
Do you hear me?

42:33.930 --> 42:34.960
Mad!

42:34.960 --> 42:36.590
And I'm gonna report you for...

42:37.050 --> 42:38.720
madness!

42:42.990 --> 42:46.360
You see, some people just can't take it.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.480
Nope.  And some people can.

42:50.890 --> 42:52.170
So, then...

42:52.170 --> 42:53.780
TARDIS!

42:53.780 --> 42:55.220
Come on!

42:57.160 --> 42:58.810
That's my car!

43:01.060 --> 43:02.660
That is like destiny.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.230
And I've been ready for this.

43:05.230 --> 43:07.560
I packed ages ago, just in case.

43:07.560 --> 43:13.500
Cos I thought, hot weather, cold weather, no weather -

43:13.500 --> 43:17.300
he goes anywhere, I've gotta be prepared.

43:18.310 --> 43:21.590
You've got a hatbox.

43:22.290 --> 43:25.370
Planet of the Hats, I'm ready!

43:26.800 --> 43:27.760
Do I need injections?

43:27.760 --> 43:30.840
Like when you go to Cambodia, is there any of that?

43:30.840 --> 43:33.280
Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain, and...

43:36.020 --> 43:37.850
You're not saying much.

43:38.570 --> 43:40.030
No, it's just...

43:42.650 --> 43:46.770
It's a funny old life, in the TARDIS.

43:46.770 --> 43:48.460
You don't want me.

43:48.460 --> 43:50.270
I'm not saying that.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.690
But you asked me.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.340
Would you rather be on your own?

43:58.340 --> 43:59.880
No.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.290
Actually, no.

44:01.290 --> 44:02.580
But...

44:07.250 --> 44:11.860
The last time, with Martha, like I said...

44:13.470 --> 44:15.270
it got complicated.

44:18.700 --> 44:20.770
And that was all my fault.

44:24.510 --> 44:26.590
I just want a mate.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.780
You just want TO MATE?

44:29.780 --> 44:31.840
I just want A mate!

44:31.840 --> 44:33.670
You're not mating with me, sunshine!

44:33.670 --> 44:36.840
A mate, I want a mate!

44:37.170 --> 44:39.630
Just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense.

44:39.630 --> 44:44.200
I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, alien nothing.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.490
There we are, then.

44:46.230 --> 44:47.560
OK.

44:50.700 --> 44:52.020
I can come?

44:52.020 --> 44:53.270
Yeah.

44:53.270 --> 44:54.710
Course you can, yeah.

44:56.670 --> 44:58.200
I'd love it.

44:58.670 --> 45:00.700
Ohh, that's just...

45:01.220 --> 45:01.990
Car keys!

45:01.990 --> 45:03.100
What?

45:03.100 --> 45:04.720
I've still got my mum's car keys!

45:04.720 --> 45:06.160
I won't be a minute.

45:16.540 --> 45:19.270
I know, Mum, I saw it, little fat people.

45:19.270 --> 45:20.420
I've got to go.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.860
I'm going to stay with Veena for a bit.

45:21.860 --> 45:22.790
'It was in the sky.'

45:22.790 --> 45:24.980
'I know, spaceship.'

45:24.980 --> 45:27.150
But I've still got the car keys.

45:28.220 --> 45:32.280
There's a bin on Brook Street 30 feet from the corner.  I'm going to leave them in there.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.320
'What? A bin?'

45:33.320 --> 45:34.670
Yes, I said 'bin'.

45:34.670 --> 45:35.500
'You can't do that.'

45:35.500 --> 45:37.820
Oh, stop complaining, the car's
just down the road a bit.

45:37.820 --> 45:40.510
Got to go, really got to go.

45:40.510 --> 45:41.180
Bye.

45:41.180 --> 45:42.770
'But Donna, you can't...'

45:44.680 --> 45:49.400
There's this woman that's going to come along, tall blonde woman called Sylvia,

45:49.400 --> 45:51.430
tell her that bin there.

45:51.430 --> 45:52.400
It'll make sense.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.900
That bin there.

46:22.530 --> 46:23.820
Off we go, then!

46:23.820 --> 46:26.150
Here it is, the TARDIS.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.140
Bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

46:28.140 --> 46:29.870
Oh, I know all that bit.

46:30.590 --> 46:33.800
Although frankly, you could turn the heating up.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.460
So, whole wide universe

46:38.600 --> 46:40.130
where do you want to go?

46:40.940 --> 46:42.780
I know exactly the place.

46:42.780 --> 46:44.080
Which is?

46:44.800 --> 46:46.730
Two and a half miles that way.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.320
Donna!

46:58.320 --> 47:00.170
It's the flying blue box!

47:06.220 --> 47:08.260
What?

47:10.690 --> 47:12.080
That's Donna.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.130
That's Donna.

47:14.930 --> 47:16.190
And that's him!

47:16.190 --> 47:17.470
That's him!

47:21.390 --> 47:22.830
Go on, girl!

47:22.830 --> 47:25.570
Go on, get up there!

47:26.040 --> 47:27.660
Hey...

47:32.660 --> 47:33.920
Ancient Rome.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.410
This is fantastic.

47:35.410 --> 47:37.750
It has come, the blue box.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.880
I see the most terrible things.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.390
The prophecies of women are limited and dull.

47:42.390 --> 47:45.470
Only the menfolk have the capacity for true perception.

47:45.470 --> 47:47.410
I tell you where the wind's blowing now.

47:47.410 --> 47:50.320
Doctor, you bring bad luck.

47:50.320 --> 47:53.790
We are building the future as dictated by the gods.

47:53.790 --> 47:56.040
I demand you tell me who you are.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.060
Doctor!

47:57.060 --> 47:59.050
The sky is falling.

47:59.050 --> 48:00.500
We're in Pompeii!

48:01.220 --> 48:02.990
And it's volcano day.
