WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.434
<i>- Previously on</i> The Strain...

00:02.436 --> 00:03.836
- They've broken through our
entire

00:03.838 --> 00:04.937
northern perimeter.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.872
Pull out of the park now.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.675
Withdraw! All units withdraw!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.810
- Sanjay Desai.
- Who are you?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.645
- He's a new associate
of ours, Eldritch.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.215
- I hear that you are
facilitating a very important

00:16.217 --> 00:19.084
shipment for us.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.688
- What is the meaning of this?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.990
You did this!
- No. This is not my doing.

00:24.992 --> 00:28.060
You've invited your own demise.
- This step I take

00:28.062 --> 00:32.131
is more merciful than triumphant.
(suitcase beeping)

00:40.875 --> 00:43.776
(explosion)

00:49.850 --> 00:52.284
(indistinct chatter)

01:00.027 --> 01:02.027
- It isn't pretty, people.

01:02.029 --> 01:06.698
Last night our forces
fell back to 42nd Street.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.035
We're hoping that they can hold the line--
- How?

01:10.037 --> 01:14.373
We're short on ammunition,
food, water, and people.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.876
It's only a matter of time before
this city falls. - I disagree,

01:17.878 --> 01:20.012
Captain.

01:20.014 --> 01:23.682
The problem is that we have been
spreading our forces too thin.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.552
- We need to fall back
to smaller enclaves,

01:26.554 --> 01:30.022
ones that we have the means to defend.
- If we play this right,

01:30.024 --> 01:32.925
we can hold out until
the labs in Atlanta, D.C.,

01:32.927 --> 01:34.893
and Virginia come up
with a cure for this.

01:34.895 --> 01:39.264
- I understand your impulse to
hang on. But the hard truth is,

01:39.266 --> 01:42.868
unless we pull out now,
we're all going to die here.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.703
- And where would we go,
Captain?

01:44.705 --> 01:48.307
- Saratoga Springs,
in the mountains

01:48.309 --> 01:52.377
outside of Albany. They have a
thousand troops. We can hold out there

01:52.379 --> 01:54.980
until D.C. gets their shit together.
(murmurs)

01:57.918 --> 02:00.085
- You want to cut and run,

02:00.087 --> 02:02.955
go ahead.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.925
But I'm not going anywhere.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.829
This is our city.

02:10.831 --> 02:15.000
A city we are sworn to protect.

02:15.002 --> 02:18.737
And I, for one,
am not going to abandon her.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.075
- Who else is with us?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.828
- It's been an honor,
Councilwoman.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.837
(indistinct chatter)

03:03.517 --> 03:07.286
(theme music)

04:12.853 --> 04:15.587
- Good to see you
again, Bob.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.690
It's been too long.
- Mr. Palmer.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.060
- Sorry to barge in
unannounced, but I'm here

04:22.062 --> 04:23.895
about a delicate matter;
one that requires

04:23.897 --> 04:25.931
the utmost discretion.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
- It's not
an imposition, sir.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.402
I-I was just surprised
to see you up and about.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.605
- Why is that?
- Sanjay Desai told us

04:33.607 --> 04:35.941
he had to assume
your responsibilities

04:35.943 --> 04:38.243
because you were incapacitated.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.046
- Well, as you can see,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.782
nothing could be further
from the truth.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.651
Bob, I've come
to you

04:45.653 --> 04:48.420
because I believe you may be one
of the few people in Stoneheart

04:48.422 --> 04:50.422
whom I can still trust.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.257
- Of course you can, sir.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.627
Tell me how I can help.
- May I?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.932
Desai is in league

05:00.934 --> 05:02.668
with certain
unscrupulous parties

05:02.670 --> 05:05.103
that are trying to gain
control of Stoneheart.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.473
I need to know about
a piece of valuable cargo

05:08.475 --> 05:12.678
that arrived in New York aboard
a ship named the Aurora Cutlass.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.814
- Yes, I've heard Mr. Desai
speaking to someone about that.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.949
- He offloaded the cargo
without my permission.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.951
I need to know where.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.621
Time is a critical factor.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.324
- I'll have the information
for you by end of day.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.660
- This my personal number.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.463
Call me as soon as
you know something.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.666
Thank you, Bob.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.873
- I can't believe Mr. Desai thought
he could get away with this.

05:45.279 --> 05:49.014
- He won't.

05:55.122 --> 05:59.658
(cane thumping)

05:59.660 --> 06:01.793
- Can I help you?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.198
- Good afternoon.
Is Mr. O'Neill in?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.867
- Do you have an appointment?
- I do not, but I'm sure--

06:08.869 --> 06:11.336
- I'm sorry, but
Mr. O'Neill is very busy.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.338
You can't just walk in here
and expect to meet with him.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.140
- Tell him his son is here.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.142
- I know Mr. O'Neill's son,

06:17.144 --> 06:19.244
and you're not him.
- Just tell him

06:19.246 --> 06:22.881
Eldritch Palmer is here.
He knows who I am.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.653
- Eldritch!

06:30.591 --> 06:34.159
You grew!
- It's been a long time.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.065
- Why the cane?
You have an accident?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.267
- One of my kidneys gave out,
and I had it removed.

06:42.269 --> 06:46.171
Good news is, I think that might have been
the source of my other health problems.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.076
- Glad to hear it.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.182
I gotta say,

06:57.184 --> 07:00.519
you kind of put me on the spot, showing
up unannounced. - I didn't have a choice.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.889
You failed to respond to my letters.
- What letters?

07:03.891 --> 07:06.391
- I wrote three of them.
(sighing)

07:06.393 --> 07:09.461
- Those kids in the mail room
probably lost them.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.564
So hard to find reliable people.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.233
- Did you know my mother
died last spring?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.102
- Yes.
- I wasn't sure.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.471
You didn't send flowers
to the funeral.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.374
- I thought about it.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.310
But then I thought:
How would that look?

07:25.312 --> 07:28.480
Suddenly, now that
the woman's dead,

07:28.482 --> 07:30.649
I make some sentimental
gesture to show

07:30.651 --> 07:33.452
what a great and
caring guy I am?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.821
You wouldn't have
wanted me to do that.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.957
So what can I
do for you?

07:38.959 --> 07:42.260
- I want to come work for you.
- Work for me?

07:42.262 --> 07:45.263
Doing what?
- I'd like a position

07:45.265 --> 07:48.733
in your investment department.
I've seen the stockholder reports.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.069
They're not handling
your assets well. Frankly,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.672
I think they're playing it
too conservatively.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.141
- Eldritch, that's
just not realistic.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.277
You're asking for a demanding,
high-pressure job

07:59.279 --> 08:03.148
with 80-hour work weeks.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.350
Frankly, I don't think
you have the stamina.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.257
- I may not be in the best
of health, but my mind

08:12.259 --> 08:15.760
is razor sharp and never gets
tired. It's always working,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.929
coming up with new ways
to make money.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.932
I suppose in that regard,
I'm very much like you.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.603
(knocking) - Hello, Lee.
- Just want to let you know

08:24.605 --> 08:27.539
Ken Shaw's in the conference room.
- Thanks, I'll be right there.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.376
Eldritch,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.778
I won't give you a job.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.448
But I am going
to give you this.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.150
Ten thousand dollars.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.152
Do some traveling.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.154
See the world while you can.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.892
Life's too short to spend it
cooped up in some office.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.894
- I don't intend
to have a short life,

08:48.896 --> 08:50.962
and I'm not interested
in traveling.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.540
- Spend it however you like.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.742
But let me be clear.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.711
This is the last check
you'll be getting from me.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.815
It fulfills whatever obligations
you imagine I have to you.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.492
Best of luck.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.215
(distant gunshots, shouting)

09:44.217 --> 09:46.051
- So where is "Nayarit"?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.486
- Nayarit...

10:00.601 --> 10:03.935
Sounds beautiful.
(police siren)

10:03.937 --> 10:08.073
- [Pull over!]

10:08.075 --> 10:11.543
- You're getting the hell out of New
York no matter what happens, all right?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.478
(gasping)
(laughing)

10:48.448 --> 10:51.750
(laughing)

11:14.307 --> 11:17.442
- You here for more silver?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.477
- No. Uh,

11:19.479 --> 11:22.781
I came by to tell you
that it's no longer safe here.

11:22.783 --> 11:27.052
NYPD is pulling out.
- Of Red Hook?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.788
- Red Hook, Manhattan,
Staten Island,

11:29.790 --> 11:32.657
everywhere.
- Jesus Christ.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.293
Well, what about the Master? Did you
find him? - We're working on it.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.896
- And the box?
- The professor finished it.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.965
But we've got a problem.
Quinlan's gone missing,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.234
and we need him to force
the Master into it.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.236
I don't how we're gonna
do it without him.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.807
- Well, we might be able to help with that.
The device we're working on,

11:48.809 --> 11:51.810
it could disorient him or maybe
even interrupt his network.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.914
- Well, it's not fully
operational right now.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.582
We have a few key
components we need--

11:57.584 --> 11:59.851
- Did you not hear
what I just said? Hm?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.753
We don't have any time
for this bullshit.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.588
All right? We've got
one day, maybe two,

12:03.590 --> 12:05.990
before the whole city is overrun. So...
- So what? We just run away

12:05.992 --> 12:08.993
like the cops? That's not gonna happen.
We have a real shot with this.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.931
- You do whatever you want,
Doc. All right?

12:12.933 --> 12:16.434
But you, you should come back
to the club with me.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.504
You know,
if all else fails,

12:19.506 --> 12:22.073
I could get us out of the city.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.244
- I, um...

12:26.246 --> 12:29.114
I appreciate
your concern. I do.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.183
But, just, we are so close.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.820
Th-this could be
a game changer.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.326
- At least I tried.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.929
Hey.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.365
I wish you the best of luck.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.160
(sniffing)

13:15.162 --> 13:18.096
- Not a whiff of spooge.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.932
Thought for sure the feelers
would be down here.

13:20.934 --> 13:24.969
- We better find one soon.
Time's running out.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.479
- Thank you.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.481
- For what?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.984
- For sticking with this.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.587
With me.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.623
- Just protecting
my interests.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.993
- How's that?
- After we slay the Master,

13:48.995 --> 13:51.796
there'll be millions of his
mindless progeny running around.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.866
Our little gadget could
make us a bloody fortune.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.537
(rustling)

13:59.539 --> 14:01.706
(snarling)

14:01.708 --> 14:04.876
- We got company.
- Where?

14:04.878 --> 14:07.111
- Behind us.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.719
(snarling)

14:40.747 --> 14:42.881
(snarling)

14:46.419 --> 14:48.319
(screaming)

14:50.891 --> 14:53.224
(snarling)

14:55.428 --> 14:57.495
(shrieking)

15:02.502 --> 15:05.169
(panting)

15:09.276 --> 15:11.409
It looks so much easier
on the nature shows.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.478
- Yeah, well, they don't
show these bits.

15:25.892 --> 15:29.060
(gunfire)
Gunfire?

15:29.062 --> 15:32.997
In Red Hook? It's been a while since
we've heard that. - In broad daylight.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.435
That's what we have
to look forward to.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.804
Human predators by day,

15:39.806 --> 15:41.806
strigoi by night.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.644
There it is.

15:46.646 --> 15:50.114
- Wow. You were right, Doc.
That's-that's double the size

15:50.116 --> 15:52.617
of the communication lobes
we've found in common strigoi.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.120
- So you think we've got a shot? - If we
can get the playback interface to work.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.122
- Pessimistic?

15:58.124 --> 16:00.124
- Not this girl.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.527
I like a challenge.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.109
- There you are.
Quinlan hasn't shown?

16:18.111 --> 16:22.447
- I gather you didn't
find him with Goodweather?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.182
- No.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.818
- He should've been back by now.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.287
Could be the Ancients
have thrown in

16:29.289 --> 16:31.956
with the Master.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.026
If so, our task grows

16:35.028 --> 16:38.796
exponentially more difficult.
- And then there's the other problem:

16:38.798 --> 16:40.531
finding the Master.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.969
What's got you so
obsessed in there, huh?

16:44.971 --> 16:47.438
- A disturbing number
of references

16:47.440 --> 16:49.607
to an occultation preceding

16:49.609 --> 16:52.944
an apocalypse.
- We had an eclipse a few weeks ago.

16:52.946 --> 16:56.047
- No. I think this refers
to something else. Something

16:56.049 --> 16:58.883
that has not yet happened.
- Professor,

16:58.885 --> 17:02.453
we need to take a step back. Now
think about the big picture.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.790
We've got one day, maybe two,
before the city falls.

17:05.792 --> 17:10.128
We need to get out.
Leave to fight another day!

17:10.130 --> 17:13.698
- For me, there is no other day.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.800
I will either do this now

17:15.802 --> 17:19.370
or die trying.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.383
(honking, sirens blaring)

17:34.320 --> 17:38.389
(people yelling)

17:43.029 --> 17:45.329
- So we gotta find another
way off this island.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.902
Make a U-turn.
Try to get through there.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.248
- So, how many
elected to stay?

18:04.250 --> 18:07.718
- Five.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.755
- Of all the officers in Manhattan
and Brooklyn? - Well, to be fair,

18:10.757 --> 18:14.826
there weren't that many
left to begin with.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.302
- We never should have
left Staten Island.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.704
We owned it.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.607
We could've ridden all of this
out from there. - I know.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.577
- Then Mayor Lyle made
that sales pitch

18:32.579 --> 18:36.013
about how I could be
the hero of New York.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.017
And I took the bait.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.291
- I just got off the phone with the ESU
in Jersey City, right across the Hudson.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.760
They have a safe zone.
Resources.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.762
We can join them.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.732
- If we stay here...

18:54.734 --> 18:57.335
seven of us?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.339
We'd probably die, right?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.513
(phones ringing)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.451
All right, people.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.821
Let's get the hell out of here.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.705
(distant gunfire)

19:34.707 --> 19:37.275
- There's three
in the gatehouse.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.443
According to your man Borgen,
there's more inside.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.612
- Are you sure
you can take it?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.149
- They're rent-a-cops, sir.
This level of security,

19:45.151 --> 19:47.818
it's more than likely that
your cargo is still inside.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.820
- Then what are we waiting for?

19:49.822 --> 19:52.223
- Your final order, sir.
Are we a go?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.292
- Yes, you are.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.294
- All right then.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.296
Let's have some fun, shall we?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.631
All teams. We're hot.
Let's roll.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.970
- Stop right there!

20:05.972 --> 20:10.474
- Intruder!
(screams and gunshots)

20:19.385 --> 20:20.818
- Stay in the vehicle,
Mr. Palmer.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.223
- Go, go!

20:30.930 --> 20:32.330
- All clear!

20:32.332 --> 20:36.067
- Fire in the hole, take cover!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.970
- Move in, move in!

20:40.907 --> 20:43.507
(gunfire)

20:45.345 --> 20:46.777
- Clear! All clear!

20:46.779 --> 20:49.180
- [Facility's secured.]

20:49.182 --> 20:51.849
[We have the cargo. And Desai.]

20:53.620 --> 20:56.087
(indistinct shouting)

20:57.790 --> 21:00.858
- Over here, sir.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.294
- Take it easy.

21:03.296 --> 21:06.797
- Your cargo, Mr. Palmer.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.907
- Mr. Desai.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.310
Nice to see you again. I, uh,

21:19.312 --> 21:22.613
I want to thank you
for handling things for me

21:22.615 --> 21:24.615
while I was incapacitated.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.984
That's what you told
my employees,

21:26.986 --> 21:29.987
wasn't it?
That I was too crippled

21:29.989 --> 21:32.957
to run my own company?
- I... That wasn't my idea,

21:32.959 --> 21:36.727
Mr. Palmer, sir.
That was Eichorst.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.597
I admire you.
I always have.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.165
That's why I wanted
to work for--

21:44.304 --> 21:46.971
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.851
(indistinct chatter)

22:21.007 --> 22:24.442
(door closing)

22:24.444 --> 22:27.812
- Are you looking for Mr. O'Neill?
- Yes, is he--

22:27.814 --> 22:30.081
- He's in the day room.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.286
- Cane.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.825
(men laughing)

22:40.827 --> 22:43.327
- (woman):
Oh, you are disgusting!

22:43.329 --> 22:45.796
- And you love it, too,
don't you?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.299
- Yes.

22:48.301 --> 22:51.402
- Hello, Father.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.407
- You have another son?

22:58.344 --> 23:01.846
- Um... Hey, it's almost lunchtime.
We don't wanna lose our table.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.215
- Nice to meet you.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.253
- I heard you had
a heart attack.

23:09.255 --> 23:12.990
I'm, uh, relieved
to see you seem to be

23:12.992 --> 23:16.527
on the mend. - What do you want?
- To thank you.

23:16.529 --> 23:20.865
- For what?
- Making me everything I am today.

23:20.867 --> 23:24.268
- That supposed to be a joke?
- Quite the contrary.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.438
That, uh, check you gave me
thirty years ago--

23:27.440 --> 23:31.275
I, uh, doubled that 10,000
in the market,

23:31.277 --> 23:35.112
then doubled it again, and
so on and so on. So you see,

23:35.114 --> 23:37.715
all my wealth,
my achievements--

23:37.717 --> 23:40.418
I owe them all to you.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.755
A check for $10,000.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.458
It fulfills whatever obligations

23:47.460 --> 23:50.027
you might imagine I have to you.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.215
- Go to hell.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.554
- By the way,

24:16.556 --> 24:19.423
I took possession of O'Neill
Industries yesterday.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.425
I guess you'd know that.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.427
You want to know what
I'm going to do with it?

24:23.429 --> 24:26.163
- I'm not interested.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.467
- I'm shutting down the mills,
sacking the management,

24:29.469 --> 24:31.802
selling off the assets.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.804
And renaming what's left

24:33.806 --> 24:35.940
Stoneheart--

24:35.942 --> 24:38.175
in honor of you!

24:38.177 --> 24:41.479
Your precious company
that you loved more than me

24:41.481 --> 24:44.315
or my mother or anyone else,

24:44.317 --> 24:47.151
will cease to exist.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.654
(laughing)

24:50.656 --> 24:52.990
What's so funny?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.292
- You.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.461
You wasted your life,

24:57.463 --> 24:59.997
trying to get even with me?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.966
Look at you!

25:01.968 --> 25:04.468
Look what
it's done to you.

25:04.470 --> 25:07.171
Withered, sickly,

25:07.173 --> 25:09.840
barely able to stand.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.043
You look older
than I do.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.348
- (voice cracking):
Good-bye, Father.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.985
- I'll outlive you!

25:20.987 --> 25:23.888
I'll dance
on your grave!

25:41.841 --> 25:45.342
- Unlock it, please.
- Well, I don't have the--

25:45.344 --> 25:48.579
- Open it or I'll blow
your goddamned head off!

25:50.850 --> 25:53.217
- Okay.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.502
- What is this?

26:11.504 --> 26:14.238
- That's a nuclear bomb, sir.

26:16.442 --> 26:19.677
- Where did it come from?
- Russia.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.513
Eichorst brokered a deal
through the black market

26:22.515 --> 26:25.883
and, uh, had it shipped
through Egypt.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.685
- Where's the other one?
- Eichorst took it.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.688
- What did he do with it?
- I don't know.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.358
- There was a massive
explosion yesterday

26:34.360 --> 26:36.860
in South Manhattan.
Is it possible?

26:36.862 --> 26:39.930
- Tactical nuke could do that.
- What did he blow up? - I don't know.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.299
I have no idea.
I swear.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.436
- No matter.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.806
I think I can find

26:48.808 --> 26:50.908
a use for this.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.210
- Use? What use?

26:55.815 --> 26:59.950
- What's your fancy, sir?

26:59.952 --> 27:02.953
- Bring him along.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.809
- Checkpoint George Washington,
Kowalski. Come in. Over.

27:25.811 --> 27:29.313
Is there anyone on
this frequency? Over.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.883
Still won't answer.
- They pulled out, too.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.622
(honking)

27:38.624 --> 27:41.325
- Dammit. (siren)
Attention, drivers.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.327
This is the New York
Police Department.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.296
[Move your vehicles off the
road. This is the New York]

27:46.298 --> 27:49.099
Police Department. Move
your vehicles off the road.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.639
I'm going up. Cat, Nankin, you
check it out; wait for my clear.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.841
- Copy that.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.715
- It's all clear!
- Let's move.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.894
- Crouse, get up top.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.700
It's a long way
back to Brooklyn.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.368
The safest thing is for us

28:24.370 --> 28:25.369
to button up and stay
here for the night.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.237
- Ah! What the--?!

28:28.307 --> 28:30.474
(shrieking hiss)

28:30.476 --> 28:33.477
- Cat, Nankin, you got
strigs on your six.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.182
Cat, Nankin, come in. Over.
(static noise)

28:38.184 --> 28:40.317
(gunfire)
(banging)

28:40.319 --> 28:43.587
- Is that you, Cat?

28:43.589 --> 28:45.756
(banging)

28:48.494 --> 28:50.060
- Open it.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.997
(hissing)

28:53.999 --> 28:57.501
Jesus!
(gunfire)

28:57.503 --> 29:00.337
- Holy shit!

29:00.339 --> 29:03.240
Damn, that's messed up.
Turn around. Let's go.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.510
What are you, crazy?

29:08.614 --> 29:10.547
What are you talking about, man?

29:10.549 --> 29:13.417
They're cops! All right?
They don't give a shit about us.

29:16.589 --> 29:20.190
- We can't wait this out.
(gunfire, hissing)

29:24.296 --> 29:26.296
(banging)

29:26.298 --> 29:29.767
- Yo, come on! Open up! Out!

29:31.036 --> 29:33.337
Come on, I don't got all night!
Come on! Come on!

29:35.875 --> 29:37.775
Come on. Let's go!

29:37.777 --> 29:40.210
- Wait. Do I know you?

29:40.212 --> 29:41.879
- Yeah, we met
on the chain gang.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.647
You wanna sit here and reminisce
or get the hell outta here?

29:43.649 --> 29:45.482
- How we gonna do that?

29:45.484 --> 29:48.986
- We gotta make for the bridge. Strigoi
can't follow us over running water.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.656
We make it past that overturned
van, and we're free. - More coming!

29:52.658 --> 29:54.792
(shrieking and hissing)

29:54.794 --> 29:56.727
- Let's go.

29:56.729 --> 29:59.163
- Let's go. Come on, come on!

29:59.165 --> 30:02.332
Angel, come on!

30:38.270 --> 30:40.103
(loud squeaking)

30:40.105 --> 30:41.605
(screaming)

30:41.607 --> 30:44.374
(shrieking and hissing)

30:48.647 --> 30:51.682
- Move, move! To the car!
Move, move!

31:01.327 --> 31:04.561
We've just gotta get past those four,
and we're free. All right? (snarling)

31:05.998 --> 31:09.867
No! No! No! Don't! Don't!

31:12.504 --> 31:14.972
No...

31:14.974 --> 31:17.374
(shrieking)

31:17.376 --> 31:19.643
SHIT! You're gonna be all right.

31:19.645 --> 31:23.313
You're gonna be all right. All right?
You're gonna be okay. All right?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.683
No! I can't! I can't go!
I'm not going without you, man!

31:26.685 --> 31:28.986
No, I'm not leaving!
I'm not leaving you!

31:29.755 --> 31:32.489
No!

31:34.827 --> 31:37.227
- Run!
- What are you doing?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.164
Why'd you do that?

31:52.211 --> 31:55.245
(screaming in pain)

32:07.960 --> 32:10.594
(shrieking)

32:20.439 --> 32:23.206
(gun runs empty)

32:25.811 --> 32:29.146
(shrieking and hissing)

32:59.278 --> 33:02.412
(screeching)

33:29.341 --> 33:33.510
- You're sure the signal won't affect us?
- Shouldn't do. The memory chip

33:33.512 --> 33:36.179
blasts the Master's signal through
the feeler's communication lobe

33:36.181 --> 33:39.383
and into the brains
of any strigoi in range.

33:39.385 --> 33:43.320
- Sounds less than definitive.
- Well, it's all theory, Doc.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.355
I could be totally wrong.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.858
- Best sales pitch ever.
(panting and grunting)

33:51.196 --> 33:53.897
This might be a good time
to turn that on. (snarling)

33:55.167 --> 33:58.602
(loud static noise)

34:13.352 --> 34:17.487
Hello? Anybody home?

34:17.489 --> 34:20.357
(low growling)

34:20.359 --> 34:23.593
(sizzling sound)

34:36.742 --> 34:39.743
- We did it! Eph!

34:39.745 --> 34:42.112
We did it!

34:42.114 --> 34:44.247
It works!

34:56.929 --> 34:59.029
It was incredible!
They were completely

34:59.031 --> 35:02.532
rudderless.
- Yeah. You, uh...

35:02.534 --> 35:04.734
You realize the Master
saw all this

35:04.736 --> 35:07.471
through the eyes of
those munchers, right?

35:07.473 --> 35:09.806
He's probably already got
a workaround, you know?

35:09.808 --> 35:13.577
- No, no, no, he didn't see
shit. The signal paralyzed

35:13.579 --> 35:15.472
their communication
systems when it paralyzed

35:15.498 --> 35:16.913
them. They just
went off his grid.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.249
- You want to seal him in this,

35:19.251 --> 35:21.084
the device can help you do that.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.953
- It worked on strigoi,

35:22.955 --> 35:26.923
but do you think it could also
incapacitate the Master?

35:26.925 --> 35:28.058
- I do.

35:28.060 --> 35:31.161
- What do you think, Mr. Fet?

35:31.163 --> 35:35.332
- It's worth a try. We could
take the contraption, but...

35:35.334 --> 35:38.235
we don't take him.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.737
- I created
the goddamn thing.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.739
- Oh, you want to take
credit for it all, huh?

35:42.741 --> 35:45.342
Dutch built it! She can run it.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.478
- Fet, why are you doing this?
- 'Cause he's a liar and a thief.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.847
- Oh, for chrissake,
Fet! Get over it!

35:50.849 --> 35:53.016
I made a mistake.
- No, no,

35:53.018 --> 35:55.352
you knew exactly
what you were doing.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.354
Not to mention all

35:57.356 --> 36:00.023
the people that have paid
for your failures.

36:00.025 --> 36:03.994
Like Nora and your wife.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.697
- How about that assault on Central Park.
How'd that work out?

36:07.699 --> 36:09.933
Half the cops
in New York are dead

36:09.935 --> 36:12.536
because of you. You're
responsible for those people!

36:15.641 --> 36:19.910
Oof!
- Hey! Hey, hey, stop it!

36:27.519 --> 36:30.453
- Stay down, Doc.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.695
- Stop this!

36:38.697 --> 36:41.565
You're giving the Master
exactly what he wants.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.368
He would love us to turn
against each other.

36:45.370 --> 36:49.372
Especially now!
- The professor's right.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.909
We've no time for your bickering.
- What happened to you?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.980
- Did you talk to the Ancients?

36:56.982 --> 36:59.583
- The Ancients are dead.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.523
- The bomb?
- Secure, sir.

37:06.525 --> 37:10.026
- Good. No time to waste.
We can expect him at any moment.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.029
- I understand the two of you
have a lot of personal issues,

37:13.031 --> 37:15.832
but you're taking
an unnecessary risk, sir.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.369
My team can handle this.
- No. I appreciate your concern,

37:19.371 --> 37:21.438
but no.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.780
(indistinct chatter)

37:35.454 --> 37:37.520
- Magnificent,

37:37.522 --> 37:39.956
is it not?

37:39.958 --> 37:43.360
- Thank you for agreeing to see me.
- I must say,

37:43.362 --> 37:46.129
I was surprised
to hear from you.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.198
It's been a long time,
and when last we spoke,

37:48.200 --> 37:50.200
you rejected my offer.

37:50.202 --> 37:52.936
- Well, I was young, impulsive.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.305
Frankly, the commitment
seemed too daunting.

37:55.307 --> 37:58.575
And I thought
that, over time,

37:58.577 --> 38:00.644
money would help me

38:00.646 --> 38:02.879
overcome my medical problems.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.215
I realize now that was folly.

38:05.217 --> 38:08.752
So I'm hoping we might

38:08.754 --> 38:10.754
revisit your proposal.

38:10.756 --> 38:14.057
- The door is still open.
- I want you to understand

38:14.059 --> 38:16.159
that there will be
no more hesitation.

38:16.161 --> 38:20.497
I intend to put all my resources
at the Master's disposal.

38:20.499 --> 38:23.233
- Now, if that's true,

38:23.235 --> 38:25.402
your life is about to change

38:25.404 --> 38:28.505
in ways you cannot
imagine.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.408
The Master will
render you immune

38:31.410 --> 38:34.377
to disease and decay.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.748
- You don't know
what that means to me.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.017
Ever since I was a boy,

38:41.019 --> 38:43.019
I dreamt of being free
of infirmity.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.355
Free of this wheelchair.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.691
Of being strong and vital.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.327
- That dream could
soon be a reality.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.098
- Now.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.033
I...

38:57.035 --> 38:59.669
wanted to clarify
the terms of our agreement.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.340
I want an equal partnership.
- The Master

39:03.342 --> 39:06.509
was quite clear.
You shall serve at his side.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.346
- Do I have his word on this?

39:09.348 --> 39:11.348
- Of course.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.017
- Forgive my mistrust.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.153
People have disappointed me
in the past.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.724
- Parents, wives, children--

39:20.726 --> 39:23.293
they all disappoint us,
Eldritch.

39:23.295 --> 39:26.196
How could they not?
They're humans.

39:26.198 --> 39:30.400
But the Master
is different.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.902
He will never let you
down or betray you.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.704
Now,

39:34.706 --> 39:37.407
do we have a deal?

39:49.521 --> 39:52.989
You crossed the line
for the last time, Eldritch.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.991
- You mean my taking possession

39:54.993 --> 39:57.494
of the nuclear bomb I paid for?

39:57.496 --> 39:59.863
- You will return it
immediately.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.065
- Certainly.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.568
Once your Master reveals himself

40:05.570 --> 40:09.739
and fulfills
his promise to-- Ah!

40:09.741 --> 40:12.776
- It's always about you,
Eldritch, isn't it?

40:15.347 --> 40:18.715
Demanding full payment
when you have yet to fulfill

40:18.717 --> 40:23.186
your part of the bargain.
- Take a look out of the window.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.889
You will see my part
of the bargain.

40:25.891 --> 40:30.860
In return, he has
given me nothing.

40:30.862 --> 40:34.130
- The Master gave you the white,

40:34.132 --> 40:36.699
which is why you're still alive.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.569
- Ah...
- And how you repay him,

40:39.571 --> 40:41.938
by plotting

40:41.940 --> 40:44.140
and scheming
to betray him.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.877
But it ends here.

40:47.879 --> 40:51.314
- Then your Master
will never get the nuke.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.450
- Oh, yes.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.623
He will.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.725
After I drink you

41:02.727 --> 41:05.295
and the worms
have had their way,

41:05.297 --> 41:07.797
the Master will have
your memories.

41:07.799 --> 41:11.734
Then, I snap your neck

41:11.736 --> 41:14.504
and silence you
for all eternity.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.674
I have been
looking forward to this

41:17.676 --> 41:21.044
for a long time.
- So have I.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.895
(roaring)

41:49.541 --> 41:52.542
- Taggart, seal the building.
- No, let him go.

41:52.544 --> 41:56.179
His Master already knows what we have done.
- What's our next move, sir?

41:56.181 --> 41:58.681
- Fetch the car.
There's not a moment to lose.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.984
I need to see Setrakian.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.753
Now.
- Yes, sir.
