<i>Nathan: Previously</i>

00:07.547 --> 00:09.463
- Pregnancy test?
- They're ovulation tests.

00:09.463 --> 00:12.047
- I think that it would
be best if I just walk away,

00:12.047 --> 00:15.255
right now, before things
get complicated.

00:15.255 --> 00:16.922
- Sonia I...
(Door slams shut)

00:16.922 --> 00:18.797
- Lionel, will you marry me?

00:18.797 --> 00:20.005
- Anne, when you marry me,

00:20.005 --> 00:22.963
I want it to be because I'm the
most beautiful boy in the room,

00:22.963 --> 00:25.338
not because you're compensating
for some lie you told

00:25.338 --> 00:26.630
about your ex-husband.

00:26.630 --> 00:28.672
Burt: You're clearly bright.
And after a few years,

00:28.672 --> 00:30.963
if your company survives,
which most don't,

00:30.963 --> 00:32.672
we can have another
conversation.

00:32.672 --> 00:34.547
- I got peri-menopause.

00:34.547 --> 00:35.963
- Menopause.
- It means I can still

00:35.963 --> 00:37.547
get pregnant,
but my door is closing.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.255
- Okay, uh Alice, remember,

00:43.255 --> 00:44.922
I need you to warn me
of obstacles,

00:44.922 --> 00:46.422
otherwise I'm gonna
get trust issues.

00:46.422 --> 00:48.463
(Crashes into chair)
- Chair!

00:48.463 --> 00:50.505
- Okay, all right,
that one's a little late but...

00:51.588 --> 00:53.380
Alice: You can take your
blindfold off now.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.047
(Birds chirping)

00:57.338 --> 00:59.838
- Oh my God, something
is happening.

00:59.838 --> 01:01.713
- Alice and I have been
talking,

01:01.713 --> 01:04.838
and we've decided to keep you.

01:06.547 --> 01:09.338
Lionel, you are everything
that I want.

01:12.588 --> 01:14.338
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I can't do that.

01:14.338 --> 01:16.713
I can't do-that is a young
man's game. Ow.

01:16.713 --> 01:17.880
- (Starts crying)

01:18.963 --> 01:22.005
- Lionel, will you continue
to spend

01:22.005 --> 01:23.922
the rest of your life with me?

01:24.922 --> 01:26.838
I don't want another big
wedding,

01:26.838 --> 01:29.630
but if you're into it, we could
do a commitment ceremony.

01:29.630 --> 01:31.922
Just with our close friends.

01:31.922 --> 01:34.255
- (Crying)
We should- hoo!

01:34.255 --> 01:36.213
- It's okay. You just-you can
take your time.

01:36.213 --> 01:38.422
- (Sobbing) Uh...
- Jesus, Dad!

01:38.422 --> 01:40.172
- Wow, okay. Yes!

01:40.172 --> 01:41.922
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
(Chuckles)

01:41.922 --> 01:43.380
<i>- Don't be gross.</i>

01:43.380 --> 01:45.255
<i>Mom, I've got this from here.</i>

01:45.255 --> 01:46.963
I'll get the ball rolling
on the ceremony.

01:46.963 --> 01:49.005
For tonight, I've got a
bachelor-bachelorette party

01:49.005 --> 01:50.713
set up for you guys
in the living room.

01:50.713 --> 01:53.838
- Alice has asked to be the
commitment ceremony planner.

01:53.838 --> 01:56.255
I thought that that would be
a very good outlet for her.

01:57.922 --> 01:59.463

02:09.463 --> 02:11.130
for Anne's big day!

02:11.130 --> 02:13.463
- Thank you for this, Val.
This is very cool of you.

02:13.463 --> 02:15.088
- My pleasure. (Chuckles)

02:15.088 --> 02:17.338
Still a little short,
but that's okay.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.172
- How you feelin' about
round two?

02:20.172 --> 02:22.130
I know my mom couldn't
be more excited.

02:22.130 --> 02:24.088
- Well, my mom didn't
even respond, so.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.297
- How you doin'?
You wanna talk about it?

02:27.297 --> 02:28.880
- Uh uh.

02:31.213 --> 02:34.005
- Hey, can I pick your brain
about something?

02:35.588 --> 02:37.963
I'm thinking of having
another... kid.

02:37.963 --> 02:39.005
- What the hell?

02:39.005 --> 02:40.463
- I know how it sounds,
it's just--

02:40.463 --> 02:42.547
- You have been saying, on
loop, "no more creatures,"

02:42.547 --> 02:44.463
since Charlie's been born.
- I know but--

02:44.463 --> 02:45.922
- And you're opening up
your own business!

02:45.922 --> 02:48.047
- Totally, it's just...

02:48.047 --> 02:51.213
look, my window is kinda...
closing here,

02:51.213 --> 02:53.130
and this could be my last shot.

02:54.172 --> 02:57.672
- Dude, just take a second
and think about it. Okay?

02:57.672 --> 03:00.547
And either way,
know that I got your back.

03:01.797 --> 03:04.380
- Guys, are these too much?

03:04.380 --> 03:06.172
- Did they even do anything
to those?

03:06.172 --> 03:07.463
- It's like being friends
with Little Kim.

03:07.463 --> 03:08.755
- It's Lil'.
- Hm, no,

03:08.755 --> 03:10.963
I think it's Little Kim.
- Lil'. Abbreviated.

03:10.963 --> 03:12.380
- So Ll?
- Yeah.

03:12.380 --> 03:15.422
- L-l-l Kim. Lil'. Lil'.

03:15.422 --> 03:17.047
- Stop that.
- Yeah. Mhm.

03:17.047 --> 03:19.922
Ian: And here's the bright
blue option. Huh?

03:19.922 --> 03:24.005
It says I'm a lot of fun,
but also I've got secrets.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.005
(Knock on door)

03:25.005 --> 03:27.672
Okay, do not go anywhere.
We're not finished here.

03:31.338 --> 03:33.005
Whoa.

03:34.588 --> 03:36.547
- Hi.
- Hi!

03:38.713 --> 03:40.130
What are you doing here?

03:41.172 --> 03:42.547
- I don't know.

03:42.547 --> 03:45.797
Uh, I was on my way to renew
my driver's license,

03:45.797 --> 03:48.505
and that always
stresses me out.

03:48.505 --> 03:50.422
You know, the lines and...

03:50.422 --> 03:51.922
and then I found myself
doing the voice

03:51.922 --> 03:54.880
that you do to make me laugh,
and it did, and...

03:56.130 --> 03:59.713
and it made me feel better...
and then worse.

04:01.213 --> 04:03.422
- Okay.

04:03.422 --> 04:05.630
- I like you a lot, and...

04:07.338 --> 04:09.213
it's like I was so worried
about the end,

04:09.213 --> 04:12.672
I was just afraid
to let it start.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.630
I mean, I don't even know
your favourite colour.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.588
- Come here.
(Sonia cries)

04:20.963 --> 04:22.755
- It's aqua.

04:22.755 --> 04:24.255
(Zoe coos)

04:24.255 --> 04:25.713
- Wow, you've really got it
covered

04:25.713 --> 04:27.338
as far as cocktail attire
is concerned.

04:27.338 --> 04:29.297
- I know. I overdid it.

04:29.297 --> 04:30.963
I didn't know
what was acceptable.

04:30.963 --> 04:33.172
(Zoe coos)
- Okay, you go.

04:34.713 --> 04:36.172
I got this.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.755
- Okay.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.672
(Footsteps thud slowly)

04:46.797 --> 04:48.422
Hi.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.088
(Zoe coos)

04:50.088 --> 04:52.463
So, let's see, Zoe girl,

04:52.463 --> 04:54.588
which one sends the right
message?

04:54.588 --> 04:56.547
Def not this one. Uh...

05:00.130 --> 05:03.130
you know, I never noticed
how beautiful your eyes are.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.380
Yeah.

05:04.380 --> 05:08.338
And do you know what would go
great with those eyes of yours?

05:08.338 --> 05:10.297
This one! See!

05:11.380 --> 05:13.213
Though I'm pretty sure
I saw this exact piece

05:13.213 --> 05:14.630
in "Miss Saigon."

05:15.880 --> 05:17.797
- Little help.

05:17.797 --> 05:19.713
- Oh, what would you do
without me?

05:19.713 --> 05:21.547
- Oh God, what would I do
without you?

05:21.547 --> 05:24.880
Roaming a beach somewhere,
childless and free.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.172
- (Chuckles)
- Sipping a margarita.

05:27.172 --> 05:29.422
- You look good.
Charlie: Daddy! Daddy!

05:29.422 --> 05:31.255
- Oh.
- Oh, I'll go help the sitter.

05:31.255 --> 05:33.547
- Thanks, babe.

05:33.547 --> 05:35.130
(Phone rings) Hm?

05:36.255 --> 05:39.088
Arg... just a second...
come on you...

05:39.088 --> 05:41.922
(Phone rings)

05:41.922 --> 05:43.588
Hello.

05:43.588 --> 05:44.880
Goddamn it.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.838
Burt: This a bad time?
- Uh no, sorry,

05:46.838 --> 05:49.130
it's just this zipper
can be a bit of a bitch.

05:49.130 --> 05:52.047
Wait, who's this?
- It's Burt Namb.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.838
- Oh uh, Mr. ...Mr. Namb.

05:54.838 --> 05:57.297

the profanity.

05:57.297 --> 05:59.005
I'm just desperately trying
to get into this wedding dress.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.755
- Oh, you're getting married.
Congratulations.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.630
- No, I'm already...
it's for a friend's wedding,

06:02.630 --> 06:04.588
I'm just trying
to get dressed for it.

06:04.588 --> 06:06.547
- Gotcha. Well, I-I'll get to
the point.

06:06.547 --> 06:08.213
My partner and I sat down
last night,

06:08.213 --> 06:10.547
we reviewed our options
for PR representation,

06:10.547 --> 06:13.005
and well, I-I don't know if
it's because he's dying or not,

06:13.005 --> 06:15.755
but (sighs) right now he's
a sucker for a good story,

06:15.755 --> 06:17.297
