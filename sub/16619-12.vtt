What was his name?

00:17.084 --> 00:18.016
His name was Elliot.

realized what you are.

- Yes, that's right.
- I'm not a killer.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.624

00:54.619 --> 00:55.819
That means they'll rescue us.

00:55.821 --> 00:57.620
Well, the FBI concluded that everyone

00:57.622 --> 00:58.888
who is still within the perimeter

00:58.890 --> 01:00.890
is a potential terrorist in disguise.

us armed in suicide belts.

It's under the building. It
goes outside the perimeter.

01:14.939 --> 01:16.604
We go there now. We go there together.

01:16.606 --> 01:18.422
Or we stay here and take our chances.

01:18.425 --> 01:20.642
Right, and walk out arm in arm, happily,

01:20.644 --> 01:22.143

01:22.145 --> 01:24.545
No, they tortured me,
and they killed Leigh.

01:24.547 --> 01:27.514
They killed Leigh because she
was a traitor to this country.

party to a conspiracy

01:30.386 --> 01:31.953

out who was an insurgent

you still need to find?

01:45.467 --> 01:47.533
Yes. I don't know who
they are or how many,

01:47.534 --> 01:49.188

01:49.191 --> 01:51.537

You have nothing I want.

09:47.857 --> 09:50.025
The point on misdirection is to control

Access to the NSA.

while you execute your mission.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.070
Your objective... to remove
your digital footprint.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.939
Our objective... To tap the NSA.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.108
Every e-mail and call
you've made at The Farm

10:43.110 --> 10:44.808
has likely been intercepted and recorded

10:44.810 --> 10:46.910
by an NSA listening post.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.980
Send an e-mail that
might compromise you later

10:48.982 --> 10:51.882
or made a phone call that
could tip off a foreign power.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.951
We're giving you a
gift of a clean slate,

10:53.953 --> 10:55.752
but you've got to clean it yourself.

10:55.754 --> 10:57.955
While they're busy
deleting their intercepts,

10:57.957 --> 10:59.790
you'll be planting a sophisticated tap

10:59.792 --> 11:02.125
in the heart of the
facility's data infrastructure.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.995
Now, since you'll be breaking
into a highly guarded,

11:04.997 --> 11:07.297
clandestine facility,
you're gonna need to use

11:07.299 --> 11:10.133
all the tools of
misdirection you can muster.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.268
We want the NSA to know you were there,

11:12.270 --> 11:14.004

11:14.006 --> 11:16.473
If you do your jobs right this time,

19:33.197 --> 19:34.563
We just need to get out right now.

19:34.565 --> 19:35.497
We're almost out.

19:35.499 --> 19:37.298
This was supposed to
be the safe way out.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.199
She was supposed to save us.

19:38.201 --> 19:39.500
We can cast blame later.

19:39.502 --> 19:41.402
For now, let's just stick to the plan.

19:41.404 --> 19:44.738
- Why?
- Just keep calm and keep moving.

19:44.740 --> 19:46.907
[Screaming]

19:46.909 --> 19:49.343
Don't worry. Come on.

19:49.345 --> 19:51.812
Carly!

19:51.814 --> 19:52.746
Ryan!

19:52.748 --> 19:55.682
- Alex!
- Ryan!

19:55.684 --> 19:58.050
We got to get the lights
back on. Come on, let's...

19:58.052 --> 19:59.652
Ryan, stop, stop.

19:59.654 --> 20:00.753
My gun.

20:00.755 --> 20:02.855
I think someone took it.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.966
Parrish has gone dark twice.

20:10.969 --> 20:12.802
Owen: Must be an interference issue.

20:12.804 --> 20:14.703
Let me see if I can
get a fix on her signal,

20:14.705 --> 20:15.671
find out where she is.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.307
Hey. Why did you come back?

20:18.309 --> 20:20.309
I was in town. I swung by.

20:20.311 --> 20:21.277
Not because of Munich,

20:21.279 --> 20:23.545
not because I almost
got myself killed there?

20:23.547 --> 20:25.680
Lydia, I understand now all those years

20:25.682 --> 20:28.316
you lied about how I got
benched was to save me,

20:28.318 --> 20:30.252
because you knew I wasn't
strong enough for the truth,

20:30.254 --> 20:32.888
and I wasn't, and I'm
still not sure I am.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.356
- Dad...
- I used to tell myself

20:35.358 --> 20:37.092
that I had so much, but the truth is,

20:37.094 --> 20:41.162
I have nothing, and once
you leave, I have even less.

20:42.698 --> 20:44.265
[Computer beeps]

20:44.267 --> 20:46.533
Parrish's signal is back on.

20:46.535 --> 20:47.434
Two minutes.

20:47.436 --> 20:49.603
Proceed to primary exit.

20:51.479 --> 20:53.299
[Door handle rattles]

20:54.250 --> 20:56.481
We've got a problem.
Primary door is jammed.

20:56.484 --> 20:58.111
Check the wiring.

20:58.113 --> 20:59.879
<i>Yeah, wiring's fun.</i>

20:59.881 --> 21:01.547
León shorted it.

21:01.549 --> 21:04.050
Primary exit is blown.
Proceed to secondary.

21:04.052 --> 21:06.052
Dayana: <i>In position and standing by.</i>

21:06.054 --> 21:09.055

21:19.700 --> 21:20.598

21:20.600 --> 21:21.599

21:21.601 --> 21:22.808
[Phone receiver clicks]

21:22.811 --> 21:24.944
<i>Parrish, get out.</i>

21:26.606 --> 21:28.440
You promised me that selfie.

21:28.442 --> 21:29.674
[Chuckles] Of course.

21:29.676 --> 21:33.277
<i>Parrish, where are you? Your
exit's been compromised.</i>

21:33.279 --> 21:34.578
- [Camera shutter clicks]
- <i>Alex!</i>

21:34.580 --> 21:36.447
- Thanks.
- Say hi to your husband.

<i>Parrish is clear.</i>

21:40.653 --> 21:42.826
[Clears throat]

21:45.825 --> 21:49.592
So, before I give you what
you asked for, you lied to me.

21:49.594 --> 21:52.229
Well, you're gonna have
to be a bit more specific.

21:52.231 --> 21:55.498
You see, the U.K., Canada,
Australia, New Zealand,

21:55.500 --> 21:58.101
and the U.S. are part of
this thing called Five Eyes.

21:58.103 --> 22:01.104
We share signals
intelligence, which means MI6

22:01.106 --> 22:03.139
didn't need whatever's
on this, and if they did,

22:03.141 --> 22:04.774
they could've asked for it themselves.

22:04.776 --> 22:05.575
So?

22:05.577 --> 22:07.843
So I did a little bit of Googling.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.746
Sir Laurence Bishop
had a son named Elliot,

22:10.748 --> 22:12.915
who died in 2008.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.850
Your Elliot.

22:14.852 --> 22:19.554
Yeah, details of my personal
life were not part of our deal.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.292
I hope you get whatever
you need from that.

22:24.294 --> 22:25.326
So do I.

22:25.328 --> 22:27.628
Owen: León Velez left
himself no other choice

22:27.630 --> 22:29.830
but to present his
endorsement card to the NSA,

22:29.832 --> 22:32.433
thus ending his
training here at The Farm

22:32.435 --> 22:34.035
and his future at the CIA.

22:34.037 --> 22:35.203
It's as simple as that.

22:35.205 --> 22:36.704
Today was a good day.

22:36.706 --> 22:38.472
You completed the op.

22:38.474 --> 22:40.673
Your SIGINT is but a memory to the NSA.

22:40.675 --> 22:44.644
The NSA, National Security
Agency, you beat them.

22:44.646 --> 22:46.213
You won.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.281
So take some pride in the fact

22:47.283 --> 22:50.017
that you're all one step
closer to being ghosts.

22:50.019 --> 22:52.119
What we do here is more than just locks

22:52.121 --> 22:53.653
and scanners and passwords.

22:53.655 --> 22:54.721
It's about people.

22:54.723 --> 22:56.823
So if you can't make
people look the other way,

22:56.825 --> 22:59.325
you don't deserve to be here,
but if you can misdirect someone

22:59.327 --> 23:00.793
for just a second, the right second,

23:00.795 --> 23:03.896
then you can commit an act of treason.

23:03.898 --> 23:06.632
That's exactly what you did today.

23:06.634 --> 23:08.567
Remember that line I told you about

23:08.569 --> 23:10.702
when you first started training here?

23:10.704 --> 23:13.505
You've just crossed it.

23:19.479 --> 23:21.980
[Footsteps approaching]

23:23.417 --> 23:25.150
You could've helped me today.

23:25.152 --> 23:27.552
Uh, yeah. You're right.

23:27.554 --> 23:28.686
I could have.

23:28.688 --> 23:31.255
You almost got me thrown out.

23:31.257 --> 23:33.657
You called him my friend.

23:33.659 --> 23:34.758
Who?

23:34.760 --> 23:36.827
Elliot.

23:36.829 --> 23:39.563
You said you were not
my friend who died.

23:39.565 --> 23:41.165
Yeah, I did.

23:41.167 --> 23:41.865
So what?

23:41.867 --> 23:44.335
Well, he wasn't my friend.

23:44.337 --> 23:46.670
He was my partner.

23:46.672 --> 23:48.338
My lover.

23:48.340 --> 23:51.707
I used to hate those words,
but his father hated them more,

23:51.709 --> 23:54.177
so I grew to love them.

23:54.179 --> 23:57.180
Elliot's father, you
may have heard of him.

23:57.182 --> 23:59.248
Sir Laurence Bishop.

23:59.250 --> 24:02.185
No? He owns just about
everything in the U.K.,

24:02.187 --> 24:04.720
including his family.

24:04.722 --> 24:07.789
When we first met, Elliot
was messing around with boys

24:07.791 --> 24:09.024
in the back rooms of bars,

24:09.026 --> 24:11.193
all the while dating appropriate women.

24:11.195 --> 24:14.463
Appropriate by his father's standards

24:14.465 --> 24:17.432
because they were women.

24:17.434 --> 24:20.768
I didn't mean to fall for him.

24:20.770 --> 24:24.571
I'd never fallen for anyone.

24:24.573 --> 24:27.441
You see, I-I-I'm quite
surprised you haven't heard of

24:27.443 --> 24:29.843
Sir Bishop because he's a
good old fresh and righteous

24:29.845 --> 24:33.514
Anglican who wanted his
only son to be so, too.

24:33.516 --> 24:35.149
It's his... his legacy.

24:35.151 --> 24:36.050
You see, we still believe

24:36.052 --> 24:37.985
in that kind of stuff where I'm from.

24:37.987 --> 24:41.021
But when he found out that Elliot and me

24:41.023 --> 24:43.856
were more than friends, he cut him off.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.358
Closed every door.

24:45.360 --> 24:51.197
Said if he wanted back, he
had to come back a man and...

24:51.199 --> 24:53.099
Well, Elliot hadn't
worked a day in his life,

24:53.101 --> 24:55.768
so he had nothing.

24:55.770 --> 24:59.271
Well, he had nothing but me.

24:59.273 --> 25:03.875
And that lasted about three months,

25:03.877 --> 25:07.112
and then he was gone.

25:07.114 --> 25:09.114
I tried to see him.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.482
But I couldn't find him.

25:10.484 --> 25:11.850
His family wouldn't talk to me.

25:11.852 --> 25:14.718
I reached out to his sister, who tried,

25:14.720 --> 25:16.454
but they got to her, too,

25:16.456 --> 25:18.889
and he stopped returning my calls.

25:18.891 --> 25:23.627
So I stopped calling.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.532
A year goes by.

25:27.534 --> 25:32.135
In the mail, a wedding invitation.

25:32.137 --> 25:34.904
"Sir Laurence Bishop
invites you to attend

25:34.906 --> 25:38.708
the wedding of his son."

25:38.710 --> 25:45.182
And I think, "Is this a joke?

25:45.184 --> 25:49.251
Is s-someone... someone trying
to s... to screw with me?"

25:49.253 --> 25:50.752
Or m-maybe it was him, you know?

25:50.754 --> 25:53.089
Maybe it was a cry for help.

25:53.091 --> 25:58.561
But whatever it was, I didn't answer.

25:58.563 --> 26:01.497
Six months later, I come
home from a night out,

26:01.499 --> 26:05.166
and there he is, in my house,

26:05.168 --> 26:09.003
looking like the wrath
of God had hit him.

26:09.005 --> 26:11.772
He was a strung out or drunk.

26:11.774 --> 26:14.709
Couldn't tell.

26:14.711 --> 26:18.779
Wanted to know if I still loved him.

26:18.781 --> 26:21.681
Wanted to know why I didn't stop him.

26:21.683 --> 26:25.018
Couldn't help him.

26:25.020 --> 26:27.687
But whatever I said,
it didn't matter because

26:27.689 --> 26:33.793
he realized then that he
couldn't have them and me.

26:33.795 --> 26:36.096
He had trapped himself in.

26:36.098 --> 26:38.897
There was no way out.

26:38.899 --> 26:40.699
And before I knew what he was doing,

26:40.701 --> 26:43.369
he grabbed a knife
from the kitchen counter

26:43.371 --> 26:47.640
and ran himself through with it.

26:47.642 --> 26:49.408
Uh...

26:49.410 --> 26:54.313
Well, not once, not twice.

26:54.315 --> 26:56.648
[Voice breaking] Three times.

26:59.650 --> 27:02.387
I tried to save him.

27:02.389 --> 27:04.989
I did.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.025
But there was so much blood.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.929
[Sighs]

27:11.931 --> 27:15.966
Just be true to yourself, Sebastian,

27:15.968 --> 27:18.169
whatever that is.

27:18.171 --> 27:20.504
Yeah, there may be sin inside of you,

27:20.506 --> 27:22.139
and that's what you
treat it, believe it.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.407
It'll be there forever.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.176
If there is, then tell her, okay?

27:25.178 --> 27:28.912
Tell her like you told me

27:28.914 --> 27:34.484
because then you won't
be in prison alone.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.542
Like you haven't figured it out.

28:08.545 --> 28:11.313
Like you didn't bring us
down here to make this happen.

28:11.315 --> 28:14.203
You wanted to draw us
out. Well, it worked.

- Here I am.
- You're AIC.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.360
This is not ending well for me.

AIC. What a stupid nickname.

I prefer CIA operative.

28:23.055 --> 28:25.122
Just like you wanted to be, Alex.

28:25.124 --> 28:28.058
The only difference
is I had what it takes.

28:28.060 --> 28:29.126
And what is that?

28:29.128 --> 28:30.661
To create a hostage crisis?

28:30.663 --> 28:32.863
What we tried to do with the G-20?

28:32.865 --> 28:35.465
Sure, some people would've
died, but in the long run,

28:35.467 --> 28:37.867
we would've saved many
more lives, and instead,

28:37.869 --> 28:39.569
how many of us are dead?

28:39.571 --> 28:43.172

No one needed to die,
and you are not a patriot.

28:49.881 --> 28:52.080
Anyone who thinks they can take the law

28:52.082 --> 28:54.316
into their own hands
is nothing but a terrorist.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.384
Except when it's you, right, Alex?

28:56.386 --> 28:59.087
You can go rogue
whenever you feel like it.

28:59.089 --> 29:03.058
The only difference between
you and us is we're organized,

29:03.060 --> 29:04.860

Olsen out of here alive,

41:06.780 --> 41:09.404
the same person who
kidnapped Will Olsen.

41:09.406 --> 41:11.540
And if they manage
to upload those drives

41:11.542 --> 41:13.375
to whomever's waiting for them,

41:13.377 --> 41:15.410
it'll make a hostage crisis at the G-20

41:15.412 --> 41:17.012
look like the best news all day.

41:17.014 --> 41:20.916
Please, Alex, you're the only one

41:20.918 --> 41:22.885
I can trust to go back in.

41:22.887 --> 41:24.319
Why?

41:24.321 --> 41:25.754
Because the person still inside

41:25.756 --> 41:27.588
is your old roommate...

41:27.590 --> 41:29.589
Dayana Mampasi.
