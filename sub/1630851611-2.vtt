WEBVTT

00:05.918 --> 00:08.138
- Any chance of getting
this thing running again?

00:08.182 --> 00:10.662
- The simplicity
of the thermosiphon cooling

00:10.706 --> 00:12.229
is sheer elegance.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.188
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

00:14.231 --> 00:16.320
often pushes us past
the pinnacle of achievement

00:16.364 --> 00:18.540
into inferior products.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.368
- And this is your brain
off of drugs?

00:20.411 --> 00:22.935
- Hey, don't weed-shame me.
I know stuff.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.415
- Okay, so is that a yes?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.851
Because soon enough,
someone's gonna see

00:25.895 --> 00:27.331
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing

00:27.375 --> 00:28.680
and the timeline's
gonna start changing.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.030
- If I can find some water,
yes.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
- Oh! Uh, Gary,

00:31.770 --> 00:33.337
can you check the back seat
for some water please?

00:33.381 --> 00:34.860
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.341
-
Please don't mention his name.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.691
This guy's giving me
terrible indigestion.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.954
- That's probably
all the cigars. Ugh.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.087
- Or all the bigotry.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.655
- Oh!

00:47.264 --> 00:50.702
Uh, we've got some soda.
Does that work?

00:50.746 --> 00:53.879
- We'll find out.
- Oh, how about this?

00:53.923 --> 00:56.056
A radio.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.059
- Oh, we can pick up
some newscasts.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.715
<i>The lovely and
lethal Bullet Blondes</i>

01:03.759 --> 01:05.587

01:09.634 --> 01:11.723
<i>They are considered

01:11.767 --> 01:13.725
- Huh, I can't believe
the name stuck.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.118
- Yeah, and they didn't
mention Hoover,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
which means they think
he's still alive.

01:17.294 --> 01:19.079
- Yeah. Well, he's not.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.864
- Wha...

01:23.648 --> 01:25.259
Hey. What's up?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.261
We've gotten out
of tighter spots than this.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.784
- Have we?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.786
Mick's gone.
Astra's down for the count.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.919
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

01:33.963 --> 01:36.574
and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.
- And it was an accident.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.620
And it could have happened
to any man of steel.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.012
- That's not funny.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.014
I spent my whole life
studying history

01:42.058 --> 01:43.973
and making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.496
By killing Hoover,

01:45.540 --> 01:47.455
I personally messed up
the entire 20th century.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.804
- Look,
we're gonna fix it, okay?

01:48.847 --> 01:50.153
- Are we?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
Because without Gideon
or the ship,

01:51.676 --> 01:53.243
there's no way you can
guarantee that.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.767
- Nate, you are spinning.
- I murdered a man, Sara.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.422
And for the first time
in our lives,

01:58.466 --> 02:01.121
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.297
- Okay, look--
- Uh, wife? Nate?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.776
We got a big problem.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.169
Hoover was supposed
to be on a train

02:06.213 --> 02:07.866
to New York from Midland
this afternoon.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.347
- If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.610
- No, it won't be.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.178
Nate, history needs saving,

02:15.222 --> 02:17.267
and you are
just the man to do it.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.487
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

02:19.530 --> 02:21.532
then the timeline
remains on track.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.621
- No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.145
No, there's no way
I can impersonate Hoover

02:25.188 --> 02:26.798
all the way to New York.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.583
I could barely do it
in some Podunk Texas town.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.977
- Gary!
- Huh?

02:32.021 --> 02:35.372
- Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

02:35.416 --> 02:37.809
- Uh,

02:37.853 --> 02:40.638
technically, yes.
But, um...

02:40.682 --> 02:43.989
I'd need some of
Hoover's spit or fingernails...

02:49.038 --> 02:52.084
- Or hair.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.871
- We're mobile, people.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
- Well, good.

02:57.438 --> 03:01.311
Because J. Edgar Hoover has
a train to catch.

03:04.358 --> 03:11.365
<i>♪</i>

03:25.248 --> 03:28.251
- I did a spell
to resurrect a machine.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.861
I don't know what this is.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.734
- I'd recognize that smug
little smile anywhere.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.518
It is Gideon.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.346
- She doesn't look
like a machine.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.044
- Well, not a machine
exactly, Mami.

03:39.088 --> 03:42.352
A computer who speaks.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.788
Usually.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.269
- Hello, computer.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.229
- Well, on the upside,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.969
looks like you got
your magic working again.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.929
- My magic is clearly garbage.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.278
Stop that.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.976
- She's still Gideon
though, right?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.108
What's two plus two?

04:01.415 --> 04:04.069
There you go.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.467
Wow, computers are--are
very exciting.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.731
- Uh--sorry.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.566
- Is it ready?
- Not yet.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
It needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.178
- Okay, well,
we need to come up

04:26.222 --> 04:27.571
with some kind of distraction
or something,

04:27.615 --> 04:28.659
because that train leaves
in five minutes,

04:28.703 --> 04:30.270
and Hoover needs to be on it.

04:30.313 --> 04:33.098
- And to the public eye,
he will be.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.970
Look, because they're not
gonna be looking at him.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.624
No. They--
- What are you doing?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.278
- Are going to be looking

04:38.321 --> 04:41.411
at the most wanted women
in America.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.283
- What?

04:43.326 --> 04:45.285
- Oh, I'm not sure about this.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.157
- Just follow my lead. Come on.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.333
- My safe word
is core competency.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.946
- Coming through here.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.644
Look out,
we got the Bullet Blondes.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.123
- This isn't the last
you're gonna hear

04:58.167 --> 04:59.603
of the Bullet Blondes.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.039
- That's right, coppers.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.432
- Who you calling the cops?

05:02.476 --> 05:03.825
We're the Bureau
of Investigation.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.522
- That's right,

05:05.566 --> 05:07.132
and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man. Or woman.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.831
Or gender non-conforming
individual.

05:09.874 --> 05:13.138
- I need four extra tickets
for my associates.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.793
- Are those the Bullet Blondes?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.795
- Well, we're not a pair
of canceled stamps.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.623
- Pleasure.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.017
- Mr. Hoover, let me find some
seats for you and your men.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.504
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

05:34.856 --> 05:38.468
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I'm commandeering this cabin.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.644
- Oh, no.
No need to commandeer.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.342
We don't want to spoil
your honeymoon.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.344
- Spoil? Phonus balonus.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.997
- Well, after them
Palmer raids,

05:46.041 --> 05:48.391
we'd be proud to help out
a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.355
- Squeeze on by here.
- Congratulations.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.357
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.059
- Whew. That was close.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.235
- Can you please
take these off now?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.369
- What are the Palmer raids?

06:09.412 --> 06:10.718
- After World War I,

06:10.761 --> 06:13.373
America was freaking out
about Communism,

06:13.416 --> 06:17.377
so Hoover and the DOJ arrested
thousands of immigrants,

06:17.420 --> 06:20.249
union workers, anything that
smelled like organized labor.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.382
- Real champion
of civil liberties.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.296
- Oh, he pretty much codified
racial bias

06:24.340 --> 06:25.863
into our judicial system.

06:25.907 --> 06:29.127
Okay, look, morally,
he's repulsive.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.521
Historically, however,

06:31.565 --> 06:34.045
he's one of the most important
men of the 20th century.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.700
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.747
- Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys, so.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.055
And that is our cue
to disappear.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.449
Oh, B, key me.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.103
- The key.

06:48.146 --> 06:51.193
Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.761
Say hi to Z for me.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.903
- Capi-tans, hey.

07:05.947 --> 07:09.167
Are we home yet?
How did your bank robbery go?

07:09.211 --> 07:11.561
Did we find out who blew up
the Waverider yet or no?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.955
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

07:13.998 --> 07:16.174
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.002
- We're still in 1925.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.961
- And now, we are on a train.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.442
- What? Where are we going?

07:23.791 --> 07:26.750
But really where is
anybody really going?

07:26.794 --> 07:29.449
- You okay, Z?
I thought you didn't partake.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.102
- No, no, no.

07:31.146 --> 07:34.758
I know, but you see
I found myself on a journey.

07:34.802 --> 07:38.762
And that journey is
with these tiny, little bears.

07:38.806 --> 07:42.244
And I'm going on that journey
a la carte.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.294
A la carte.
"Allah" carte.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.513
- Okay.
Well, we'll be upstairs.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.123
- Yeah, if you need anything,

07:52.167 --> 07:53.821
please don't hesitate
to come and find us.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.997
Actually, hesitate a little.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.304
- Oh, hesitate a lot.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.785
- Ew, that's gross, moms.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.792
- Hey, maybe
we won't even need that potion.

08:08.836 --> 08:09.793
We just hide out in the cabin.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.318
- You in there, Speed?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.407
- Speed?
- That was Hoover's nickname.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.018
Only his closest friends
call him that.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.804
- It's Francis Baker.
Junior, of course.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.415
Oh, the GW boys
are gonna go wild

08:23.459 --> 08:25.026

08:25.069 --> 08:28.246
- Gary, potion.
- Uh, it's frothing and ready.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.510
- All right.
How long does the spell last?

08:30.553 --> 08:32.033
- Uh, it depends
upon your metabolism.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.817
Could be an hour. Could be 24.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.994
- Hey, it sounds like Hoover
was a supreme douche.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.344
You really sure
you want to be him?

08:39.388 --> 08:41.259
- I have to clean up
my mess, B.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.264
- No, but wait. Wait.
Don't drink it in front of us.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.184
- Did it work?
- We don't know.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.838
Since you drank it
in front of us, we'll only know

08:54.882 --> 08:56.231
if the magic works
when someone else sees you.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.668

- Yeah. Sure.
More comfortable.

- Ew.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.434
No thank you.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.088

10:11.132 --> 10:12.786
- I wish the Legends
would just get back already.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.178
They would know exactly
what to do with her

outsider apple art.

They can't find this
Dr. Davies guy soon enough.

Now she's broken.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.859
- Yeah. Why?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.644

Are you mad that we're
honeymooning in your house,

Well, if you ever want to talk

- No, seriously.

11:08.885 --> 11:14.195
I am A-okay.
I am golden.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.893
- You know what?
Just--just hear me out, Z.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.809
No judgment, okay?
I'm just...

11:19.853 --> 11:21.898
I think you and Behrad
are very different people,

11:21.942 --> 11:24.509
and I think that maybe
your coping mechanisms

11:24.553 --> 11:26.642
might not be the same
as his coping mechanisms.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.819
- You know, honestly,
I'm not sure

11:29.863 --> 11:31.560
that I'm doing
this stoned thing correctly,

11:31.603 --> 11:35.825

You're like me.

I love a project.

Let's find you a project.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.837
Ooh, cleaning. Cleaning.
That's a good one.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.447

Clean the John vibes.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.190
- Yes. Yes! That's my girl.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.627
- You know, at minimum,
it will give me an excuse

11:55.671 --> 12:00.110
to leave this room,
because you guys are very loud.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.112
- What?
Come on. We're not loud.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.377
- Core competency.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.465
Boop.

- I don't even know
what you're talking about.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.661

Is there a Mrs. Hoover?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.315
- Oh, no, ma'am.
I'm married to my job.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.057
- Oh, well,
let me give you my card,

ever get divorced.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.761
My purse. It's gone.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.501
- Never fear, madam.

12:43.545 --> 12:47.331
You have the nation's finest
detective at your service.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.988

Well, I must get

They're buying it.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.611

Gary and I are petty thieves,

14:33.655 --> 14:35.178
'cause of our looks.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.353

authentically Hoover

14:36.397 --> 14:38.007

14:38.051 --> 14:39.356

Why don't we go
back to Plan A?

Hunkering.
- You're right.

There's a plot afoot
to kidnap you.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.919
Hoover cosplay or kidnapping--
- Listen.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.225
The real J. Edgar
Hoover was never kidnapped.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.748
So he must have solved this.
- No.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.750
This is getting
way too out of control.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.404

there's no more do-overs?

15:28.449 --> 15:29.798

We owe it
to history to make it right.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.152
Gentlemen,
this sounds like a case

15:36.196 --> 15:37.762
for the Bureau
of Investigation.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.989
- Has she had

anything to drink.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.166
She's not a person.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.779

what a computer is,

15:54.823 --> 15:57.434
but I know a heartbeat.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.132
And you made that, Astra.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.528
You are not only
a very powerful witch.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.791
You're also a mother now.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.969

- Dang.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.623
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.712

Rory's old room.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.976
There's always space
for one more with the Legends.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.021
- And where are
your Legends now, anyway?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.371

to meet this time travel guy.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.765
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.377
- Okay. I'm no expert,

16:27.421 --> 16:31.120
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

16:31.164 --> 16:32.643

go back to right

16:32.687 --> 16:36.343

I mean, unless...

16:36.386 --> 16:38.171

- Not a lot of detail.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.270
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.492
- "Hoover on tren, northbond."

16:55.536 --> 16:57.233
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.367
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.587
- Men in Little Rock
are gonna alert D.C.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.936
Plan to have agents at
every station along the route.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.503
- Good.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.766
- Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.551
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.031
We'll turn this train
upside-down,

17:12.074 --> 17:14.250

17:14.294 --> 17:16.557
- Hoover doesn't run
an investigation from behind.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.602
All right.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.169
All we got to go on
is this telegram,

17:20.213 --> 17:22.432
which doesn't give us
a motive or a means.

17:22.476 --> 17:26.262
But its timing does narrow down
the list of possible suspects.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.742
- Donovan, Rodgers.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.396
Get me a list
of all the passengers

17:29.439 --> 17:32.094

since Midland. Go.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.530
On it, sir.

17:33.574 --> 17:34.705

are gonna start

17:34.749 --> 17:36.098
at the front
of the train,

17:36.142 --> 17:37.273
and we're gonna
work our way back.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.535
We're looking for anyone

17:38.579 --> 17:40.450
who has a reason
to hurt Hoover.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.238
- Who would possibly want
to hurt that guy?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.850
- "Please" would have been
nice.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.376
- Is there anyone on this train

17:53.420 --> 17:56.075
you may suspect of having
anti-government sentiment?

17:56.118 --> 17:57.815
- Anti-government?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.730
The government is the only
thing keeping this country

17:59.774 --> 18:01.384
from going to the dogs.

18:01.428 --> 18:04.518
- Have you heard anyone talk
about anarchy or...

18:06.607 --> 18:07.869
socialism?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.437
- Well, that depends.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.744
Would you call
a working wage socialism?

18:13.788 --> 18:16.617
Then yeah. I'd say
we're all talking about it.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.664
- Lovely to see America
by train car.

18:21.665 --> 18:24.146
- Be a lot lovelier
if I wasn't being spied on

18:24.190 --> 18:26.148
by a bunch of dicks.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.933

- Hmm.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.283
- Well, you think someone

18:30.326 --> 18:32.589

is a ne'er-do-well?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.591
Well,
good luck pulling one over

18:34.635 --> 18:36.637

18:45.907 --> 18:47.343
- Hoover?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.128
Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.305
- Ugh, tell me about it.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.178
- Everybody on this train
loves Hoover.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.137
- Yeah, everybody
with first-class tickets.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.183
The people we talked to would
be happy to kill "Hoover."

19:01.227 --> 19:04.012
- If we're looking for motive,
we got it.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.622
Lots of it.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.450
- Yeah, which is as good
as finding none at all.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.148
We're switching
this investigation away

19:09.191 --> 19:12.716
from the "why"
and onto the "how."

19:12.760 --> 19:15.502
And with agents in every city,
it'll be pretty hard

19:15.545 --> 19:17.460
pulling off a kidnapping
in any of the stations.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.809
They'd get caught immediately.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.681
- Or congratulated.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
- But if you could get
the train off the main route--

19:24.511 --> 19:26.034
- No one would be
guarding the track.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.210
- And if you can redirect
the train,

19:28.254 --> 19:29.211
you have control of the train.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213

19:37.785 --> 19:39.482

to work today,
