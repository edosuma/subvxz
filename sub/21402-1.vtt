00:13.848 --> 00:15.641
( instrumental music )

00:22.773 --> 00:25.484
My name's Chloe.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.361
I'm 20.

00:27.361 --> 00:31.072
I'm an art student at Wells

00:27.361 --> 00:31.072
College in Bradford, New York.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.411
I don't remember the first time

00:36.411 --> 00:39.999
I picked up a brush

00:36.411 --> 00:39.999
and tried to paint.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.500
There's a lot

00:39.999 --> 00:41.500
about being little

00:41.500 --> 00:43.711
that I just can't seem

00:41.500 --> 00:43.711
to remember.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.130
My first day of school.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.634
When I learned to ride a bike.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.595
My eighth birthday.

00:53.595 --> 01:00.019
All things that I know

00:53.595 --> 01:00.019
happened, but I can't

00:53.595 --> 01:00.019
seem to access them.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.603
( instrumental music )

01:11.279 --> 01:13.782
I've lived in this town

01:11.279 --> 01:13.782
my whole life.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.788
I've walked across this bridge

01:16.744 --> 01:19.788
maybe a thousand times.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.836
But...I don't know

01:22.416 --> 01:25.836
many people here.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.718
It's hard to tell who

01:30.340 --> 01:32.718
to trust sometimes.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.141
That all changed when

01:37.639 --> 01:40.141
the dream started.

01:42.895 --> 01:48.650
The dream began to

01:42.895 --> 01:48.650
unlock...everything.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.406
( engine idling )

02:05.751 --> 02:07.461
( tires squeal )

02:16.011 --> 02:17.304
( tires squeal )

02:17.304 --> 02:18.597
( loud gasp )

02:18.597 --> 02:19.890
( panting )

02:30.567 --> 02:32.235
( instrumental music )

02:36.657 --> 02:41.536
What I'm about to tell you is

02:36.657 --> 02:41.536
the story according to me.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.622
And it's tricky when you don't

02:41.536 --> 02:43.622
know if your own story has

02:43.622 --> 02:45.290
a reliable author.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.085
Today we're going to

02:45.290 --> 02:48.085
discuss the works

02:48.085 --> 02:51.296
of post-impressionist painter,

02:48.085 --> 02:51.296
Vincent van Gogh.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.633
The dream was just

02:51.296 --> 02:54.633
the start of it.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.052
It felt like

02:54.633 --> 02:57.052
a warning.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.261
And there was really no one

02:57.052 --> 02:58.261
I could talk to about it

02:58.261 --> 03:00.848
who would understand.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.184
I couldn't trust

03:02.141 --> 03:05.184
anyone with it.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.062
No one except

03:05.184 --> 03:07.062
my friend, Rebecca.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.900
But she didn't

03:09.356 --> 03:11.900
understand everything.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.110
CHLOE: It's happening

03:11.900 --> 03:13.110
more and more.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.820
It's always

03:13.110 --> 03:14.820
the same truck?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.113
I think so.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.367
But this time it was

03:17.698 --> 03:20.367
chasing you?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.952
Maybe it's

03:20.367 --> 03:21.952
a premonition.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.287
Or maybe you're worried

03:21.952 --> 03:24.287
about something.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
Your fall showcase project

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
perhaps?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.918
Right, like

03:26.832 --> 03:29.918
the truck represents

03:26.832 --> 03:29.918
my art professors

03:29.918 --> 03:31.920
just looming in the shadows

03:29.918 --> 03:31.920
waiting to run me down

03:31.920 --> 03:33.130
with their opinions.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.715
Don't laugh.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.674
You do put

03:34.715 --> 03:35.674
a lot of pressure

03:34.715 --> 03:35.674
on yourself.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.591
You're right.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.968
That must be it.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.761
First semester anxiety.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.221
Thanks for

03:39.761 --> 03:41.221
the diagnosis.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.472
Ahh, not so fast.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.933
What else?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.933
What else what?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.018
How've your headaches been?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.519
Headaches are fine.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.104
You'd tell me if they weren't

03:47.519 --> 03:49.104
fine though, right?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.190
Of course, I tell you

03:49.104 --> 03:51.190
everything.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.232
You better.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.484
( instrumental music )

03:59.698 --> 04:04.161
CHLOE:  Like many of you,

03:59.698 --> 04:04.161
I have a few secrets.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.624
And I've become good

04:06.454 --> 04:09.624
at hiding them.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.629
He had secrets too.

04:16.964 --> 04:21.053
There was something about him

04:16.964 --> 04:21.053
that seemed...broken.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.975
The walking wounded can

04:23.764 --> 04:26.975
sense it on each other.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.146
Something happened to him.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.066
His confidence.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.568
His serenity.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.320
Or his faith.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.033
There were definitely scars

04:40.697 --> 04:43.033
under his skin

04:44.325 --> 04:46.578
and they were

04:44.325 --> 04:46.578
leading him to me.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.835
About ten years ago they

04:51.959 --> 04:53.835
started a restoration

04:53.835 --> 04:56.546
but they ran out of money.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.090
You can see a good number

04:56.546 --> 04:58.090
of them have cracks

04:58.090 --> 05:02.136
and are no longer

04:58.090 --> 05:02.136
secured to the floor.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.891
Well,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.891
the wood's fine.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.559
Yeah, there's

05:07.891 --> 05:09.559
some cracks

05:09.559 --> 05:12.938
but, I mean,

05:09.559 --> 05:12.938
the structure's

05:09.559 --> 05:12.938
good overall.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.233
Good, because we don't have

05:12.938 --> 05:16.233
the budget to replace very much.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.567
Nah, I wouldn't do that.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.447
Just get somebody in here to

05:19.236 --> 05:22.447
swap out these angle irons.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.243
Maybe even replace

05:23.615 --> 05:26.243
the cleats too.

05:26.243 --> 05:30.205
As far as the cracks, just throw

05:26.243 --> 05:30.205
some colored epoxy in there.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.873
It's gonna look better

05:30.205 --> 05:31.873
than fresh wood patches.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.375
When do you want to start?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.460
Me?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.755
Nah, you've got to get

05:36.711 --> 05:38.755
yourself a pro.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
Um, thing is

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
I sort of already told

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
the trustees you'd do it.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.218
And that you'd give us

05:41.800 --> 05:43.218
a great deal.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.803
It's not my problem,

05:43.218 --> 05:44.803
big brother.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.680
Josh, you'd be doing me

05:44.803 --> 05:46.680
a huge favor.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.140
We both know you can do it.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.225
Never met a more gifted guy

05:48.140 --> 05:50.225
in my life.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.019
Yeah, nice try.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.478
Look, you got

05:52.019 --> 05:53.478
a church full of people

05:52.019 --> 05:53.478
ready to help you out.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.479
Say the word.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.941
Right.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.904
Okay.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.991
Thank you, Josh.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.828
Oh - almost forgot.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.789
Calls are still

06:09.828 --> 06:12.789
coming for you at

06:09.828 --> 06:12.789
the house.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.042
Got one from the Global

06:12.789 --> 06:15.042
Missions Institute.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.295
They'd love to set up

06:16.877 --> 06:18.295
an interview.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.713
Thanks.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.008
You going to call?

06:24.676 --> 06:25.802
Probably not.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.222
( instrumental music )

06:31.766 --> 06:33.185
Have a nice day.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.185
Thanks.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.022
CHLOE:  I moved out

06:35.103 --> 06:37.022
on my own a few months ago.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.776
With school, it seemed

06:38.523 --> 06:41.776
the right thing to do.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.196
But really, my mom

06:41.776 --> 06:44.196
and I haven't been

06:44.196 --> 06:46.365
on the same page for some time.

06:46.365 --> 06:52.162
Her need for me to need her

06:46.365 --> 06:52.162
and my refusal to do so,

06:52.162 --> 06:54.497
it had us moving in

06:52.162 --> 06:54.497
different directions.

06:56.291 --> 07:00.879
Two strangers living on

06:56.291 --> 07:00.879
different frequencies.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.256
Hey, Chloe.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.050
Mom?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.802
I know, I know, showing up

07:05.050 --> 07:07.802
at work is not cool.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.930
But I've been trying to get

07:07.802 --> 07:09.930
a hold of you

07:09.930 --> 07:14.017
and, well, I get worried about

07:09.930 --> 07:14.017
you when I don't hear from you.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.644
I'm fine, Mom.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.605
See? All in one piece.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.440
How's school?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.609
OK.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.860
Well, maybe we can

07:22.609 --> 07:23.860
grab a bite to eat

07:23.860 --> 07:26.280
once you finish up.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.283
I wish I could

07:26.280 --> 07:29.283
but I really have

07:26.280 --> 07:29.283
to work

07:29.283 --> 07:31.034
on my showcase

07:29.283 --> 07:31.034
project tonight.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.495
Well, I'm glad that

07:32.577 --> 07:34.495
everything is going OK.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.416
Maybe you could come by

07:35.789 --> 07:37.416
this weekend

07:37.416 --> 07:39.084
and we can do

07:37.416 --> 07:39.084
something together.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.378
I miss you.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.796
Miss you too, Mom.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.301

( instrumental music )

08:14.328 --> 08:17.038
( video playback )

08:14.328 --> 08:17.038
Hey Josh, I woke up

08:14.328 --> 08:17.038
this morning

08:17.038 --> 08:19.624
and I just had this song

08:17.038 --> 08:19.624
in my head

08:19.624 --> 08:21.876
and it made me think

08:19.624 --> 08:21.876
of you and me.

08:21.876 --> 08:26.173
So do me a favor and just never

08:21.876 --> 08:26.173
stop seeing with your heart.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.426

08:36.224 --> 08:37.851

08:53.700 --> 08:56.911

08:56.911 --> 09:00.957
My sister died doing

08:56.911 --> 09:00.957
something that she loved...

09:00.957 --> 09:03.543
helping people in a country

09:03.543 --> 09:07.297
where walking three miles

09:03.543 --> 09:07.297
for three gallons of water was

09:07.297 --> 09:09.632
an everyday occurrence.

09:09.632 --> 09:14.929
She had such an amazing spirit;

09:09.632 --> 09:14.929
her infectious smile,

09:14.929 --> 09:19.351
caring personality

09:14.929 --> 09:19.351
and her devotion to God,

09:19.351 --> 09:22.020
impacted all that knew her.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.898
And now, through

09:22.020 --> 09:24.898
this scholarship,

09:24.898 --> 09:29.319
she will impact many more

09:24.898 --> 09:29.319
for years to come.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.405
Thank you.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.572
( applause )

09:32.572 --> 09:33.990
( instrumental music )

09:48.922 --> 09:51.925
I always liked this one.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.135
Your first year at Columbia.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.638
I liked your speech.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.058
It's really difficult

09:57.638 --> 10:00.058
to talk about.

10:02.143 --> 10:07.982
But it honors Hannah

10:02.143 --> 10:07.982
and it will make

10:02.143 --> 10:07.982
a difference,

10:07.982 --> 10:11.611
which is what she

10:07.982 --> 10:11.611
always wanted to do.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.406
Got to keep

10:11.611 --> 10:14.406
looking forward, right?

10:14.406 --> 10:15.574
Yeah.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.080
Did you really

10:18.826 --> 10:22.080
cancel an interview

10:18.826 --> 10:22.080
with Project Hope?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.793
It wasn't

10:25.250 --> 10:26.793
the right timing.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.086
Timing?

10:29.921 --> 10:32.757
You loved interning

10:29.921 --> 10:32.757
with them last year.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.718
I always get the sense

10:35.718 --> 10:38.721
that you're still trying

10:35.718 --> 10:38.721
to figure it all out.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.809
It's not your fault.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.856
Yep, I'm still Hannah's

10:45.728 --> 10:48.856
annoying little sister.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.567
Especially when

10:48.856 --> 10:50.567
it comes to you.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.319
( instrumental music )

11:16.176 --> 11:17.760
(whispering) You saw

11:16.176 --> 11:17.760
what happened.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.845
What's wrong with you?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.308
(whispering) You saw

11:22.182 --> 11:23.308
what happened.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.351
Get off me!

11:25.726 --> 11:27.187
(whispering) You saw...

11:27.187 --> 11:28.313
Get off!

11:28.313 --> 11:29.939
( heartbeats and eerie music )

11:36.363 --> 11:37.197
Aahh!

11:37.197 --> 11:38.239
( panting )

11:43.036 --> 11:45.246
No, no.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.289
Aahh!

11:49.125 --> 11:52.795
♪ Surrender your word ♪

11:55.674 --> 11:58.926
♪ Uncover your heart ♪

11:58.926 --> 12:00.178
( cell phone vibrates )

12:03.056 --> 12:04.265
( phone beeps )

12:04.265 --> 12:05.975
Hey Josh, it's Mark.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.602
Uh, you snuck out before

12:05.975 --> 12:07.602
I could catch you,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.646
but we're having a cookout

12:07.602 --> 12:09.646
on Saturday.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.772
I asked Hannah's sister Brooke

12:09.646 --> 12:11.772
to come by.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.317
Let me know if you can make it.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.528
( tires squeal )

12:26.287 --> 12:27.288
Hey!

12:33.169 --> 12:36.047
Hey... are you okay?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.885
You're shivering.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.220
Look, did somebody

12:40.885 --> 12:42.220
do this to you?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.013
You're freezing.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.807
Listen, my name is Josh.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.976
Look at me. Is there

12:46.807 --> 12:48.976
somebody else out here?

12:48.976 --> 12:51.605
Okay, I'm going to call 911,

12:48.976 --> 12:51.605
everything's going to be okay.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.314
We gotta get you

12:51.605 --> 12:53.314
off this road.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.612
What is your name?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.866
( voice over PA )

13:06.453 --> 13:08.162
We'll need to ask her

13:06.453 --> 13:08.162
a few questions in a minute.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.330
That shouldn't be

13:08.162 --> 13:09.330
a problem.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.542
(PA system)  Dr. Isaac dial zero.

13:12.542 --> 13:16.170
Josh? I'm Sgt. Stanford.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.589
You're the one

13:16.170 --> 13:17.589
that found her?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.215
Yeah.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.884
She's an art student

13:19.215 --> 13:21.884
up at the college.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.720
That's paint all over her,

13:21.884 --> 13:23.720
not blood.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.222
( Josh sighs )

13:26.222 --> 13:28.015
Now the last thing she

13:26.222 --> 13:28.015
remembers is working late

13:28.015 --> 13:29.976
in one of

13:28.015 --> 13:29.976
the studios up there.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.270
So what happened?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.812
If she knows,

13:32.270 --> 13:33.812
she's not saying.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.190
Did she say anything

13:35.064 --> 13:36.190
to you?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.152
No.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.529
Nothing that made any sense.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.781
(phone rings)

13:42.781 --> 13:43.822
Excuse me.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.950
Yeah, Stanford.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.620
Uh huh.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.126
( door opens )

13:56.795 --> 13:59.297
Hey.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.300
So sorry, I tried to get over

13:59.297 --> 14:02.300
as soon as I could.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.968
How did you know I was here?

14:03.968 --> 14:05.512
You called me.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.971
Don't you remember?

14:09.390 --> 14:12.185
You said you'd tell me

14:09.390 --> 14:12.185
if there was ever a problem.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.311
There hasn't been.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.481
I've been OK.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.191
You're OK for

14:16.481 --> 14:18.191
a little while, but it's

14:16.481 --> 14:18.191
getting pretty clear

14:18.191 --> 14:20.610
that these blackouts

14:18.191 --> 14:20.610
aren't just gonna go away.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.948
I think it's time you talked

14:22.403 --> 14:25.948
to your mom about this.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.202
Chloe, it's heartbreaking

14:25.948 --> 14:29.202
to watch this happen to you.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.709
I can see that you're scared

14:31.579 --> 14:35.709
but I won't leave you.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.126
If you talk to someone

14:35.709 --> 14:37.126
about this,

14:37.126 --> 14:38.670
I will stay with you

14:37.126 --> 14:38.670
through all of it.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.754
No.

14:42.173 --> 14:45.343
Well, you're going to have

14:42.173 --> 14:45.343
to think of something

14:45.343 --> 14:47.804
or they're going

14:45.343 --> 14:47.804
to keep you here.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.514
( knocking )

14:52.099 --> 14:53.434
You up for

14:52.099 --> 14:53.434
a few more questions?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.521
I'll be right outside.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.903
Campus security gave me a call.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.531
Said the art room you were in

15:03.903 --> 15:06.531
was pretty messed up.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.700
What happened up there?

15:09.868 --> 15:11.619
I didn't do anything wrong.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.665
Let me ask you something,

15:11.619 --> 15:15.665
if we were to run a drug test,

15:16.916 --> 15:18.752
what's gonna pop up?

15:18.752 --> 15:22.004
I didn't take anything, OK?

15:18.752 --> 15:22.004
I'm not on drugs.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.215
You're gonna have to give me

15:22.004 --> 15:24.215
something.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.719
The docs here want to put you

15:24.215 --> 15:27.719
on mental health arrest.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.640
Chloe, I'm on your side.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.810
Why don't you

15:34.100 --> 15:35.810
let me help you?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.733
I've been working late a lot.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.777
I haven't been getting

15:41.733 --> 15:43.777
much sleep.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.362
So, you're telling me this is

15:43.777 --> 15:46.362
sleep deprivation?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.947
Hmm mm.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.450
Nice try.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.369
This school is just

15:50.450 --> 15:53.369
so competitive

15:53.369 --> 15:57.081
that I need

15:53.369 --> 15:57.081
to be my best all

15:53.369 --> 15:57.081
the time.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.917
Because everyone else

15:57.081 --> 15:58.917
is so perfect.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.503
And, I just, I just

15:58.917 --> 16:02.503
don't think my work

15:58.917 --> 16:02.503
measures up.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.174
You on a scholarship?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.342
I am.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.721
And it was really

16:09.427 --> 16:11.721
hard to get.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.057
And I really don't want

16:13.139 --> 16:15.057
to lose it.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.063
CHLOE:  It's a challenge

16:19.228 --> 16:21.063
finding the right balance

16:21.063 --> 16:23.691
to stay one step ahead

16:21.063 --> 16:23.691
in moments like this.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.614
There is always some real truth

16:26.277 --> 16:29.614
under the truth you tell.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.994
But, even if I could understand

16:31.157 --> 16:34.994
what happened,

16:36.454 --> 16:38.873
even if I had the words

16:36.454 --> 16:38.873
to explain it,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.585
I couldn't trust

16:40.333 --> 16:42.585
anyone with it.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.545
( rattles doorknob )

16:44.545 --> 16:46.631
It's a mess in there.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.719
Campus security talk to you yet?

16:55.723 --> 16:58.309
I really just need to get

16:55.723 --> 16:58.309
my project back.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.769
Your project?

17:00.687 --> 17:01.855
It's ruined.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.640
She went to Bradford.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.641
In your class?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.560
The year after me.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.770
She was always kind of

17:40.560 --> 17:42.770
a loner, by choice.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.231
I mean, she didn't call too much

17:42.770 --> 17:45.231
attention to herself.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.734
I don't remember her...

17:45.231 --> 17:47.734
at all.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.236
Well, bet you won't

17:47.734 --> 17:50.236
forget her now.

17:51.863 --> 17:52.989
How's it looking?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.076
Like I'm stuck doing

17:55.115 --> 17:57.076
all the cooking.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
Sounds like Josh didn't get

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
much attention today.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.873
Mark, you better give

17:59.495 --> 18:01.873
baby brother a hug.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.125
Just got off the phone.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.253
The board gave your quote

18:05.125 --> 18:07.253
a thumbs up.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.255
You can start on

18:07.253 --> 18:09.255
the benches any time.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.342
I know what you're

18:11.799 --> 18:13.342
doing, Mark.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.428
What's that?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.221
The benches.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.017
It's not going to work.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.770
You think with me spending

18:21.017 --> 18:23.770
all this time in the church

18:23.770 --> 18:27.314
that I'm going to start

18:23.770 --> 18:27.314
coming back into things.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.316
Go on.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.985
I don't want to

18:29.316 --> 18:30.985
disappoint you, brother.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.570
You can never disappoint me.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.199
I just don't like seeing you

18:34.280 --> 18:37.199
hurting like this.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.453
I don't care if you don't

18:38.451 --> 18:40.453
like it.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.414
It's not about you.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.794
Josh, you're right.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.754
I'm sorry.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
Dinner's ready!

18:53.507 --> 18:55.426
Lord God, we thank You

18:53.507 --> 18:55.426
for all the gifts

18:55.426 --> 18:58.096
You give us each day.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.849
We thank You even when we

18:58.096 --> 19:01.849
can't understand things,

19:01.849 --> 19:04.477
You are still in control.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.814
Give us faith to hold fast

19:04.477 --> 19:07.814
to what we know is true...

19:09.941 --> 19:12.192
CHLOE:  A lot of people tell you

19:09.941 --> 19:12.192
to let your secrets out

19:12.192 --> 19:14.194
so they don't have

19:12.192 --> 19:14.194
power over you.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.699
I don't know.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.410
Maybe I just never knew anyone

19:18.699 --> 19:21.410
I trusted that much.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.625
More often than not,

19:24.080 --> 19:27.625
when I gave myself away,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.503
it came back to hurt me.

19:32.755 --> 19:36.509
When a secret's out,

19:32.755 --> 19:36.509
then a part of you is out.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.220
It's something that belongs

19:37.927 --> 19:40.220
to others now.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.183
And you don't control

19:41.848 --> 19:44.183
the darkness anymore.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.900
( wind blowing )

20:02.368 --> 20:04.704
(whispering) You saw.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.171
You saw what happened.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.338
( screams )

20:14.338 --> 20:16.674
(whispering) You've seen it.

20:16.674 --> 20:17.675
( eerie music )

20:58.424 --> 20:59.800
( papers rustling )

21:21.822 --> 21:23.950
I think it's a premonition.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.993
Stop.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.120
I think this is saying

21:25.993 --> 21:27.120
that something bad is

21:27.120 --> 21:28.537
going to happen to you.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.497
It's just a bad dream.

21:30.497 --> 21:34.127
Yes, a dream about you!

21:34.127 --> 21:37.213
OK, I'm listening.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.548
I think that these drawings

21:37.213 --> 21:39.548
are saying

21:39.548 --> 21:42.509
that something tragic is

21:39.548 --> 21:42.509
going to happen.

21:42.509 --> 21:46.222
OK, well, then we need

21:42.509 --> 21:46.222
to talk to someone.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.141
Who?

21:48.141 --> 21:52.603
I think I know, and just

21:48.141 --> 21:52.603
hear me out.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.855
He's one of the pastors

21:52.603 --> 21:54.855
at my church.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.690
His name is Mark.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.690
He's a great guy.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.568
He's a great listener.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.568
He's... helpful.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.238
Are you serious?

22:02.238 --> 22:03.697
Like that's who you

22:02.238 --> 22:03.697
came up with?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.449
I get it, but haven't you

22:03.697 --> 22:05.449
ever wondered

22:05.449 --> 22:07.160
what it would be like

22:05.449 --> 22:07.160
to feel safe?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.829
To feel like

22:07.160 --> 22:09.829
you really matter?

22:13.207 --> 22:14.667
Just think about it.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.919
Either it helps or we're back

22:14.667 --> 22:16.919
where we started.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.507
I'll meet you there

22:19.630 --> 22:21.507
after my shift.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.932
MARK:  Living out your faith is

22:27.888 --> 22:29.932
so important.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.102
It's not easy.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.438
Never forget that when you're

22:33.102 --> 22:36.438
going through suffering...

22:36.438 --> 22:40.318
nothing can separate you

22:36.438 --> 22:40.318
from God's love.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.155
Put your hand up if you've

22:42.153 --> 22:44.155
ever been sad before.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.991
Look around.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.536
Everyone's hand is up.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.873
Everyone goes through

22:50.536 --> 22:53.873
hard times.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.959
Know that in each one

22:53.873 --> 22:56.959
of those times

22:56.959 --> 23:00.378
when you went through

22:56.959 --> 23:00.378
difficulty, God was with you.

23:00.378 --> 23:03.007
Each and every one of you.

23:03.007 --> 23:06.927
Always, especially during

23:03.007 --> 23:06.927
the most difficult times.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.388
Remember that.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.388
Know that.

23:10.388 --> 23:13.433
Take confidence in it.

23:10.388 --> 23:13.433
I sure do.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.519

24:41.605 --> 24:42.648
How you doing?

24:45.359 --> 24:46.402
Good.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.239
Everything okay?

24:51.657 --> 24:55.286
Yeah, I'm just waiting

24:51.657 --> 24:55.286
for somebody.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.205
Well, I'm glad you're

24:56.745 --> 24:58.205
feeling better.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.799
Josh?

25:07.047 --> 25:08.799
Yeah.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.511
Do you know Rebecca?

25:14.430 --> 25:16.056
Rebecca?

25:16.056 --> 25:18.017
I don't think so.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.643
We're meeting

25:18.017 --> 25:19.643
with Pastor Mark.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.771
What, tonight?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.940
Well, there's no one left in

25:22.771 --> 25:24.940
the church...

25:24.940 --> 25:26.608
Pastor Mark's not here?

25:26.608 --> 25:27.651
No.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.699
Hey, do you have

25:31.947 --> 25:33.699
a phone?

25:33.699 --> 25:34.700
Maybe you can call her?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.076
N-no, that's fine.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.911
I think I know where

25:36.076 --> 25:37.911
she might be.

25:37.911 --> 25:38.996
But...

25:41.165 --> 25:42.458
( street noises )

25:44.584 --> 25:46.170
( door closes )

26:12.405 --> 26:13.697
Help you, honey?

26:13.697 --> 26:15.282
Yeah uh...is Rebecca here?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.992
Um, I'm not sure.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.576
There's a table of kids

26:16.992 --> 26:18.576
around the corner.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.288
Maybe she's back there.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.633
Uh...did she have

26:31.090 --> 26:33.633
to work late?

26:33.633 --> 26:36.387
Who's that?

26:33.633 --> 26:36.387
Rebecca.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.931
I'm sorry, sweetie,

26:36.387 --> 26:38.931
I don't know who

26:36.387 --> 26:38.931
you're talking about.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.140
Is she not back there

26:38.931 --> 26:40.140
with those kids?

26:40.140 --> 26:42.518
No. She's a waitress here.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.144
Are you sure you have

26:42.518 --> 26:44.144
the right place?

26:44.144 --> 26:46.522
Yes, Rebecca.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.981
Everything OK?

26:47.981 --> 26:50.109
She's looking for someone

26:47.981 --> 26:50.109
named, Rebecca

26:50.109 --> 26:52.319
that she says works here.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.071
Ain't nobody named

26:52.319 --> 26:54.071
Rebecca work here.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.614
OK, did she set

26:54.071 --> 26:56.614
you guys up for this?

26:56.614 --> 26:57.741
Will you tell her

26:56.614 --> 26:57.741
that I went to

26:56.614 --> 26:57.741
the church?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.243
OK? I waited there

26:57.741 --> 26:59.243
for her.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.953
Honey, there is nobody

26:59.243 --> 27:00.953
here named Rebecca.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.342
Will you stop saying that!

27:15.342 --> 27:16.469
Of course, there's

27:15.342 --> 27:16.469
a Rebecca here.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.095
She works here!

27:18.095 --> 27:19.679
I don't know what you want me

27:18.095 --> 27:19.679
to tell you, sweetie.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.390
There's no one here.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.390
Stop calling me "sweetie"!

27:21.390 --> 27:22.600
OK, either you get out

27:21.390 --> 27:22.600
of here or I'm calling

27:21.390 --> 27:22.600
the cops.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.976
You know what?

27:22.600 --> 27:23.976
Go ahead.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.352
Uh look, maybe we better

27:23.976 --> 27:25.352
go outside.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.728
They won't tell me

27:25.352 --> 27:26.728
where Rebecca is.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.063
OK, then I'll help you

27:26.728 --> 27:28.063
find Rebecca.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.565
Lola, do not call

27:28.063 --> 27:29.565
the cops.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.899
Josh, you know her?

27:29.565 --> 27:30.899
JOSH: Yes.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.109
You need to get her

27:30.899 --> 27:32.109
out of here.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.402
You need to relax.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.778
Chloe, Rebecca's not here

27:34.778 --> 27:36.780
and they're going

27:34.778 --> 27:36.780
to call the cops.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.449
and I'll help

27:36.780 --> 27:38.449
you find her but

27:36.780 --> 27:38.449
we need to get out of here.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.749
Chloe!

27:47.749 --> 27:49.418
We don't need any crazy

27:47.749 --> 27:49.418
people in here.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.462
You call the cops.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.756
Hey!

27:54.756 --> 27:56.800
Hey, slow down.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.800
Get away from me!

27:56.800 --> 27:58.469
I'm just trying

27:56.800 --> 27:58.469
to help you.

27:58.469 --> 27:59.761
I don't need your help, OK?

27:58.469 --> 27:59.761
I need to find Rebecca

27:59.761 --> 28:00.887
and something's

27:59.761 --> 28:00.887
happened to her

28:00.887 --> 28:02.473
and they all know it.

28:02.473 --> 28:03.599
I told her that something

28:02.473 --> 28:03.599
was going to happen.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.142
Why don't we try this?

28:05.142 --> 28:06.310
Tell me where she lives

28:05.142 --> 28:06.310
and we'll go to my truck

28:06.310 --> 28:07.603
and I will take you there.

28:09.896 --> 28:13.233
She, um...

28:09.896 --> 28:13.233
Why can't I remember?

28:13.233 --> 28:15.152
OK, look, you're confused,

28:13.233 --> 28:15.152
it's okay to be confused.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.321
I'm not confused, OK?

28:15.152 --> 28:17.321
So stop treating me like a baby!

28:17.321 --> 28:18.447
I'm not treating you

28:17.321 --> 28:18.447
like a baby!

28:18.447 --> 28:19.697
Just tell me.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.241
Does she live in town

28:21.241 --> 28:22.535
because wherever you want

28:21.241 --> 28:22.535
to go, I'll take you.

28:22.535 --> 28:23.577
( siren blasts )

28:25.078 --> 28:26.288
CHLOE: Oh no.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.337
Miss? Hold it right there.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.130
OFFICER: We got a call

28:33.337 --> 28:35.130
that you were a little upset.

28:50.187 --> 28:51.689
( papers rustling )

28:57.736 --> 28:58.862
This is her?

29:02.824 --> 29:06.745
Yeah, I talked to the owner

29:02.824 --> 29:06.745
of the diner.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.499
He said nobody named Rebecca

29:06.745 --> 29:10.499
worked there right now.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.501
She was at the hospital

29:10.499 --> 29:12.501
the other night

29:12.501 --> 29:14.545
when you came in.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.714
She was?

29:16.714 --> 29:18.507
She was in the room when

29:16.714 --> 29:18.507
you came to talk to me.

29:18.507 --> 29:22.886
Chloe, no one was in that

29:18.507 --> 29:22.886
hospital room with you.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.934
( sighs )

29:32.229 --> 29:34.231
How long have you

29:32.229 --> 29:34.231
been seeing these?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.527
I've been seeing them

29:36.442 --> 29:38.527
in pieces for a while now.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.739
What, are you going to put me

29:40.028 --> 29:41.739
under mental health arrest?

29:41.739 --> 29:44.283
That's not up to me.

29:44.283 --> 29:49.455
I'm just here trying

29:44.283 --> 29:49.455
to sort through all this

29:44.283 --> 29:49.455
right now.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.791
I'm going to show you

29:49.455 --> 29:52.791
a picture and I want you

29:49.455 --> 29:52.791
to tell me

29:52.791 --> 29:56.587
if it looks

29:52.791 --> 29:56.587
like your friend,

29:52.791 --> 29:56.587
Rebecca Cole.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.342
That her?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.720
Yes.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.263
Where is she?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.263
Just calm down.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.765
No. What happened to her?

30:07.765 --> 30:10.934
Where did she go?

30:07.765 --> 30:10.934
Just one thing at a time.

30:10.934 --> 30:13.437
How did you meet Rebecca,

30:10.934 --> 30:13.437
do you remember?

30:14.688 --> 30:16.356
At the diner.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.775
My mom and I used to go

30:16.356 --> 30:17.775
and she would wait on us.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.568
The girl in that picture?

30:17.775 --> 30:19.568
Yes.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.528
You're positive.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.528
Yes.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.196
And you became friends?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.196
Where is she?

30:23.196 --> 30:24.323
Chloe, you're right.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.202
Rebecca worked at

30:26.325 --> 30:29.202
the Parkside Diner.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.333
But she went missing

30:32.080 --> 30:34.333
12 years ago.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.265
That can't be true.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.770
You were a little girl.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.648
Maybe you don't remember.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.486
I'm going to

30:59.650 --> 31:02.486
take you over to

30:59.650 --> 31:02.486
the hospital

31:02.486 --> 31:04.613
and some doctors are going

31:02.486 --> 31:04.613
to take a look at you.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.533
You mean the Psych Ward.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.578
You been there before?

31:13.079 --> 31:14.331
Once.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.793
When you were little?

31:19.919 --> 31:20.962
Yeah.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.675
I want you to sit tight.

31:24.675 --> 31:26.092
You can hang on to that

31:24.675 --> 31:26.092
if you want.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.764
( chair scrapes )

31:45.362 --> 31:48.198
( sighs ) Sorry to

31:45.362 --> 31:48.198
keep you waiting.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.036
( deep sigh )

31:53.036 --> 31:55.121
I thought things were

31:53.036 --> 31:55.121
getting better for her.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.419
You kid yourself.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.128
She hasn't been

32:00.419 --> 32:02.128
returning my calls.

32:02.128 --> 32:05.131
I'm thinking she's so busy,

32:02.128 --> 32:05.131
you know, caught up in school.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.132
Hmm.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.135
So this is

32:07.718 --> 32:09.135
the first time

32:09.135 --> 32:10.470
something like this

32:09.135 --> 32:10.470
has happened?

32:15.016 --> 32:18.061
No. This is more progressive.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.065
When she was eight years old,

32:22.065 --> 32:24.526
she started having

32:22.065 --> 32:24.526
these episodes.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.696
She called them blackouts.

32:29.865 --> 32:33.535
And the doctors, they said

32:29.865 --> 32:33.535
it was some kind of amnesia.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.581
Maybe um, maybe stress related,

32:37.581 --> 32:40.959
or triggered by some kind

32:37.581 --> 32:40.959
of food allergy, you know,

32:40.959 --> 32:45.255
something that she eventually

32:40.959 --> 32:45.255
would grow out of.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.302
All the things

32:48.884 --> 32:50.302
the doctors say

32:50.302 --> 32:51.929
when they don't know

32:50.302 --> 32:51.929
what else to say, right?

32:51.929 --> 32:53.179
Hmm.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.640
And you want to believe them

32:54.640 --> 32:56.099
because you don't know

32:54.640 --> 32:56.099
what else to believe.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.521
You don't want to believe that

32:59.269 --> 33:01.521
there's something deeper

33:01.521 --> 33:04.399
and darker going on

33:01.521 --> 33:04.399
with your daughter.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.945
Did she ever get extensive

33:04.399 --> 33:07.945
professional help?

33:07.945 --> 33:09.780
Yeah.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.949
But she didn't want

33:09.780 --> 33:11.949
to open up to him.

33:11.949 --> 33:16.244
She became more and more

33:11.949 --> 33:16.244
guarded over the years.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.122
You attend church

33:16.244 --> 33:19.122
at Riverside?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.792
Yeah.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.044
So Chloe would

33:21.792 --> 33:25.044
know Pastor Mark

33:21.792 --> 33:25.044
from there?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.340
Sure.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.340
Hmm.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.467
When Chloe was

33:28.340 --> 33:30.467
a little girl,

33:32.344 --> 33:35.514
it wasn't a really good

33:32.344 --> 33:35.514
time for me.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.851
There's a lot of things

33:35.514 --> 33:38.851
that I did that, uh,

33:38.851 --> 33:40.143
that I'm not proud of.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.983
And actually, there's a lot

33:43.104 --> 33:45.983
that I really don't remember.

33:49.778 --> 33:50.863
It's okay.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.073
( sniffles )

33:59.371 --> 34:01.540
( jukebox playing

33:59.371 --> 34:01.540
in background )

34:03.667 --> 34:05.168
Hey.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.168
Hey.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.337
My friend Julie works at

34:05.168 --> 34:07.337
the hospital.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.839
She said they took Chloe

34:07.337 --> 34:08.839
over there.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.676
Do you think

34:10.255 --> 34:12.676
she's hallucinating

34:10.255 --> 34:12.676
all this?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.221
I don't know.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.514
Rebecca Cole.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.976
I remember all that like

34:18.514 --> 34:20.976
it was yesterday.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.020
I completely forgot that

34:20.976 --> 34:23.020
she worked at the diner.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.648
( phone ringing )

34:28.650 --> 34:29.943
Oh, it's Julie.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.529
Hey.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.072
What? Wait what?

34:35.072 --> 34:36.909
No, hang on,

34:35.072 --> 34:36.909
you're breaking up.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.831
OK, I didn't do

34:42.330 --> 34:43.831
anything wrong.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.250
I was just trying to find

34:43.831 --> 34:45.250
my friend!

34:45.250 --> 34:46.710
I need you

34:45.250 --> 34:46.710
to stop moving

34:45.250 --> 34:46.710
for me, OK?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.797
Have you taken

34:49.588 --> 34:50.797
anything tonight?

34:50.797 --> 34:52.549
No!

34:50.797 --> 34:52.549
Tell me so I can help you.

34:52.549 --> 34:53.759
Yeah, I just need to find

34:52.549 --> 34:53.759
my friend!

34:53.759 --> 34:55.427
COP: Hey, hey, hey!

34:55.427 --> 34:56.844
JOSH: She's just

34:55.427 --> 34:56.844
a little confused.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.844
COP: Come on, Miss.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.681
JOSH: This isn't necessary.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.681
Hold on.

34:59.681 --> 35:00.807
Please help me.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.439
You're not going

35:05.562 --> 35:07.439
to believe this.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.857
Chloe ran off.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.609
They were

35:08.857 --> 35:10.609
holding her at

35:08.857 --> 35:10.609
the ER

35:10.609 --> 35:12.485
and when no one was looking,

35:10.609 --> 35:12.485
she just slipped out.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.196
The whole

35:12.485 --> 35:15.196
police department is on

35:12.485 --> 35:15.196
the search.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.115
( sighs )

35:28.376 --> 35:33.548
CHLOE:  When I was little,

35:28.376 --> 35:33.548
I used to live this

35:28.376 --> 35:33.548
fantasy story.

35:36.718 --> 35:42.223
I'd play in a field of

35:36.718 --> 35:42.223
wildflowers, feeling free.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.310
Safe.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.482
Imagining I could be

35:47.854 --> 35:50.482
like that someday.

35:55.320 --> 36:01.076
But really...the feeling

35:55.320 --> 36:01.076
never lasted very long.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.790
There was always something

36:04.871 --> 36:06.790
pulling me back.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.644
I know it's crazy.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.605
I can't explain Rebecca.

36:33.316 --> 36:37.946
Even now, it's impossible

36:33.316 --> 36:37.946
for me to understand.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.119
But there was a reason

36:42.117 --> 36:44.119
she came to me.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.249
A reason for all of it.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.005
And I had to find out why.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.551
Before everyone found me.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.917
( drill running )

37:39.966 --> 37:41.009
You OK?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.596
Why wouldn't I be?

37:44.596 --> 37:47.849
After last night,

37:44.596 --> 37:47.849
just thought

37:44.596 --> 37:47.849
I'd check in.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.643
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.813
( drill running )

37:58.902 --> 38:00.153
( sighs )

38:01.320 --> 38:02.655
( crickets chirping )

38:11.330 --> 38:12.958
( drill whirring )

38:28.223 --> 38:29.266
Hey.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.689
A lot of people are

38:35.147 --> 38:36.689
looking for you.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.317
I used to go

38:37.899 --> 38:39.317
to church here.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.360
Yeah?

38:44.322 --> 38:45.406
Me, too.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.575
They told me Rebecca vanished.

38:49.202 --> 38:50.453
Yeah, I know.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.455
I don't get what's

38:50.453 --> 38:52.455
happening to me.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.917
And I don't understand what

38:52.455 --> 38:55.917
happened to Rebecca.

38:57.627 --> 38:58.628
Is it really true?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.715
Yeah.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.467
I don't want to go back

39:02.715 --> 39:04.467
to that hospital.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.178
You don't have to go to

39:04.467 --> 39:06.178
the hospital.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.932
Why don't we just do this?

39:12.976 --> 39:15.353
Can you sit and talk

39:12.976 --> 39:15.353
for awhile?

39:12.976 --> 39:15.353
Can you do that?

39:17.647 --> 39:18.773
I'll stand here.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.693
You can talk.

39:21.693 --> 39:25.822
( chuckles ) OK.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.457
I want to be someone

39:34.206 --> 39:36.457
you can trust, Chloe.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.421
I don't know if

39:40.086 --> 39:42.421
I can do that.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.342
Come on.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.697
Do you know what

40:05.737 --> 40:07.697
happened to her?

40:07.697 --> 40:08.907
No.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.035
Not really.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.663
Nobody does.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.663
She just disappeared.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.917
Don't you remember?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.168
It was a big deal in town

40:18.917 --> 40:20.168
when it happened.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.132
I don't feel very well.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.093
Where's the bathroom?

40:28.093 --> 40:29.177
Oh, it's just downstairs.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.907
( toilet flushes )

41:04.629 --> 41:05.964
( water running )

41:25.524 --> 41:27.485
(whispering) You saw.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.904
( light fixture buzzes )

41:33.325 --> 41:34.826
(whispering) You saw

41:33.325 --> 41:34.826
what happened.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.953
You saw what he did.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.871
( gasps )

41:38.871 --> 41:40.957
( dramatic music )

41:42.417 --> 41:44.169
(whispering) You saw

41:42.417 --> 41:44.169
what he did,

41:44.169 --> 41:47.213
you saw what happened.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.341
You saw.

41:52.469 --> 41:55.763
You saw what he did,

41:52.469 --> 41:55.763
you saw what happened.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.808
( eerie music )

42:02.728 --> 42:05.023
You saw what happened.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.445
( door squeaks )

42:11.821 --> 42:12.947
Rebecca?

42:12.947 --> 42:15.033
(whispering) Chloe.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.784
( eerie music )

42:25.335 --> 42:26.419
Rebecca!

42:31.549 --> 42:34.844
Rebecca...wait!

42:44.937 --> 42:46.105
Rebecca.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.779
CHLOE: Rebecca!

42:56.615 --> 42:58.535
(whispering) You saw

42:56.615 --> 42:58.535
what he did.

42:58.535 --> 43:00.036
MAN:  I'm not done talking.

42:58.535 --> 43:00.036
WOMAN: You just leave me alone!

43:00.036 --> 43:01.704
(whispering) You saw

43:00.036 --> 43:01.704
what he did.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.998
You saw what happened.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.791
I told you!

43:05.791 --> 43:07.835
Get off me!

43:07.835 --> 43:10.296
( screams )

43:14.342 --> 43:15.760
This is the place.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.011
(whispering) You saw

43:15.760 --> 43:17.011
what he did.

43:17.011 --> 43:19.472
You saw what happened.

43:19.472 --> 43:22.225
( eerie music )

43:22.225 --> 43:23.851
( gasps )

43:25.103 --> 43:26.771
You saw.

43:28.064 --> 43:29.232
I saw.

43:32.902 --> 43:33.903
JOSH: Chloe!

43:38.116 --> 43:39.367
Hey.

43:45.081 --> 43:46.499
This is where it happened.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.918
Maybe we should go back.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.753
I saw.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.924
I think I saw it happen

43:52.338 --> 43:54.924
and I just didn't remember.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.217
Well then,

43:54.924 --> 43:56.217
let's go tell them.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.886
They won't listen to me.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.222
Here.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.310
Somebody killed her.

44:06.561 --> 44:07.604
Chloe.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.283
STANFORD:  You should

44:18.114 --> 44:20.283
have called me

44:18.114 --> 44:20.283
the minute you saw her.

44:20.283 --> 44:21.909
Sir, I have

44:20.283 --> 44:21.909
no real excuse

44:21.909 --> 44:24.370
other than I think there's

44:21.909 --> 44:24.370
more going on here.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.830
Maybe she's connected

44:25.830 --> 44:26.872
to Rebecca Cole's

44:25.830 --> 44:26.872
disappearance somehow.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.040
What do you mean?

44:28.040 --> 44:29.083
Maybe she saw

44:28.040 --> 44:29.083
someone kill her.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.335
( scoffs )

44:30.335 --> 44:32.253
Look, Sgt. Stanford,

44:30.335 --> 44:32.253
all I'm saying is

44:32.253 --> 44:34.672
maybe you should get someone to

44:32.253 --> 44:34.672
go to the woods and search them.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.049
The ones along

44:34.672 --> 44:37.049
the river.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.259
Did you know that

44:37.049 --> 44:38.259
Rebecca Cole came

44:38.259 --> 44:40.261
from a pretty tough situation?

44:41.846 --> 44:45.433
No.

44:41.846 --> 44:45.433
Yeah. Foster kid.

44:45.433 --> 44:48.769
Bounced from one place

44:45.433 --> 44:48.769
to another.

44:48.769 --> 44:53.899
Ran away a lot, didn't stay

44:48.769 --> 44:53.899
in one place for too long.

44:53.899 --> 44:58.404
She was arrested a few times,

44:53.899 --> 44:58.404
spent a year in juvie.

44:58.404 --> 45:03.034
The job at the diner, she got

44:58.404 --> 45:03.034
through a work release program

45:03.034 --> 45:04.494
set up by the state.

45:06.996 --> 45:10.041
Sir, don't all runaways

45:06.996 --> 45:10.041
eventually turn up

45:06.996 --> 45:10.041
some place?

45:10.041 --> 45:11.376
Not all the time.

45:12.544 --> 45:16.589
Chloe is

45:12.544 --> 45:16.589
a troubled girl, Josh.

45:16.589 --> 45:18.966
I don't think she knows what

45:16.589 --> 45:18.966
she's saying half the time.

45:20.468 --> 45:23.638
If you see her again,

45:20.468 --> 45:23.638
you call me.

45:24.805 --> 45:25.848
OK.

45:26.683 --> 45:27.850
I'm serious.

46:24.156 --> 46:26.158
(car lock chirp )

46:26.158 --> 46:27.619
Mom?

46:30.787 --> 46:31.830
Chloe?

46:33.458 --> 46:34.500
( gate squeaks )

46:36.669 --> 46:38.963
I think I have some

46:36.669 --> 46:38.963
answers.

46:38.963 --> 46:41.215
I think I know what happened

46:38.963 --> 46:41.215
to Rebecca.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.258
Honey...

46:42.258 --> 46:44.427
No, I think I saw it happen.

46:44.427 --> 46:45.637
I just blacked it out.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.305
OK.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.723
Let me just

46:47.305 --> 46:48.723
take you back to

46:47.305 --> 46:48.723
the hospital, OK?

46:48.723 --> 46:50.849
and we'll get it

46:48.723 --> 46:50.849
all sorted out.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.770
They're not going

46:52.226 --> 46:53.770
to believe me.

46:53.770 --> 46:55.313
You don't even believe me.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.482
Chloe I just...

46:55.313 --> 46:57.482
I just want

46:55.313 --> 46:57.482
to help you.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.484
But I feel like

46:57.482 --> 46:59.484
you don't

46:57.482 --> 46:59.484
want me to.

46:59.484 --> 47:02.903
Anything that I do,

46:59.484 --> 47:02.903
I do because

46:59.484 --> 47:02.903
I love you.

47:02.903 --> 47:06.741
And I just want you

47:02.903 --> 47:06.741
to trust me, that's all,

47:02.903 --> 47:06.741
just trust me.

47:08.825 --> 47:11.912
It hurts me

47:08.825 --> 47:11.912
to see you

47:08.825 --> 47:11.912
hurting, OK?

47:11.912 --> 47:14.248
Let's go home.

47:14.248 --> 47:17.168
No outsiders if

47:14.248 --> 47:17.168
that's what you want.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.170
We can talk about

47:17.168 --> 47:19.170
all of it.

47:21.464 --> 47:23.549
Come on, Chloe.

47:23.549 --> 47:25.884
I can't. I can't.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.012
Chloe, stop!

47:28.012 --> 47:30.222
( footsteps running away )

47:32.600 --> 47:34.851
( sighs )

47:37.730 --> 47:39.357
( birds chirping )

47:55.956 --> 47:59.126
( metal clanging )

48:33.745 --> 48:35.079
( truck engine )

48:37.248 --> 48:39.958
( doorbell chimes )

48:39.958 --> 48:41.878
Hi.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.878
Hi.

48:41.878 --> 48:43.170
Are you from

48:41.878 --> 48:43.170
the cable company?

48:43.170 --> 48:45.423
Mrs. Sutton,

48:43.170 --> 48:45.423
I'm Josh Griffin.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.550
We spoke on

48:45.423 --> 48:47.550
the phone earlier.

48:47.550 --> 48:51.262
I told you, there's not

48:47.550 --> 48:51.262
much I have to say.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.598
Right.

48:53.598 --> 48:56.684
I was just hoping that maybe

48:53.598 --> 48:56.684
if we talked face to face...

48:56.684 --> 49:00.145
I'm waiting for

48:56.684 --> 49:00.145
the man to come

48:56.684 --> 49:00.145
and fix my TV.

49:00.145 --> 49:02.314
Missed half my programs

49:00.145 --> 49:02.314
already today.

49:02.314 --> 49:05.067
Maybe we could talk

49:02.314 --> 49:05.067
while you're waiting.

49:05.067 --> 49:08.112
Do you know anything

49:05.067 --> 49:08.112
about cable?

49:08.112 --> 49:11.407
When Rebecca's caseworker

49:08.112 --> 49:11.407
approached us about her.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.117
She said she'd be

49:11.407 --> 49:13.117
a handful...

49:13.117 --> 49:15.411
She had a lot of trouble

49:13.117 --> 49:15.411
in her other homes.

49:15.411 --> 49:18.581
She never gave us

49:15.411 --> 49:18.581
any trouble though.

49:18.581 --> 49:20.583
She kept

49:18.581 --> 49:20.583
to herself a lot.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.084
You know,

49:20.583 --> 49:22.084
the news articles

49:22.084 --> 49:23.294
never said anything

49:22.084 --> 49:23.294
about her parents.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.837
Well, they wouldn't.

49:24.837 --> 49:26.589
She never really knew them.

49:26.589 --> 49:29.717
I had a lot of kids

49:26.589 --> 49:29.717
through my house

49:26.589 --> 49:29.717
in those days

49:29.717 --> 49:31.761
and they all

49:29.717 --> 49:31.761
had their problems,

49:31.761 --> 49:35.264
but she seemed at peace

49:31.761 --> 49:35.264
with herself.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.810
That run-away business just

49:35.264 --> 49:38.810
never made sense to me.

49:40.686 --> 49:42.104
I kept her stuff.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.606
Do you want to see?

49:45.065 --> 49:49.194
Come on, you're doing

49:45.065 --> 49:49.194
no good back there.

49:49.194 --> 49:50.947
Yeah, I tried.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.576
I never knew what

49:52.197 --> 49:55.576
to do with this.

49:55.576 --> 49:59.121
I never had one of my kids

49:55.576 --> 49:59.121
leave and not come back.

50:13.845 --> 50:16.806
She made friends at work.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.774
They had a Bible study

50:24.229 --> 50:26.774
at school.

50:26.774 --> 50:30.695
One of the girls in her class

50:26.774 --> 50:30.695
invited her to the meetings.

50:30.695 --> 50:32.237
May I?

50:33.322 --> 50:35.867
( vehicle approaches )

50:35.867 --> 50:37.952
There he is.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.119
Excuse me.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.112
CHLOE:  I read somewhere

51:12.236 --> 51:14.112
that your mind protects you

51:14.112 --> 51:17.950
from certain things.

51:17.950 --> 51:21.245
Especially when you're little.

51:21.245 --> 51:24.582
And sometimes it only lets

51:21.245 --> 51:24.582
you know about them

51:24.582 --> 51:27.543
when you're ready.

51:27.543 --> 51:31.672
The curtain drops and memories

51:27.543 --> 51:31.672
can come flooding back.

51:33.758 --> 51:36.761
It was that thought that

51:33.758 --> 51:36.761
led me back here.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.512
( thunder rumbles )

51:40.890 --> 51:42.892
This place and I are

51:40.890 --> 51:42.892
forever connected now.

51:42.892 --> 51:45.978
MAN: Come on, Rebecca,

51:42.892 --> 51:45.978
let me give you a ride.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.396
REBECCA: Are you drunk?

51:47.396 --> 51:48.814
MAN: No.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.190
REBECCA: Yes, you are.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.190
You're drunk again.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.275
MAN: Come on,

51:50.190 --> 51:51.275
you'll get soaked.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.276
Rebecca?

51:52.276 --> 51:53.819
Would you

51:52.276 --> 51:53.819
leave me alone?

51:53.819 --> 51:55.446
What, I'm not good enough

51:53.819 --> 51:55.446
to give you a ride?

51:55.446 --> 51:56.739
REBECCA: I'm not interested.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.739
OK?

51:56.739 --> 51:58.032
I'm not done talking.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.241
Would you just leave me alone?!

51:59.241 --> 52:00.325
Don't talk to me like that.

52:00.325 --> 52:01.535
REBECCA: Get off me!

52:01.535 --> 52:03.037
What's wrong with you?

52:01.535 --> 52:03.037
Get of me!

52:03.037 --> 52:05.121
( screams )

52:34.902 --> 52:36.737
( footsteps )

52:39.281 --> 52:41.283
( labored breathing )

53:27.121 --> 53:28.580
Hey, Josh.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.248
Hi, Lola.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.670
I hear the cops

53:32.417 --> 53:34.670
are looking

53:32.417 --> 53:34.670
for your friend.

53:37.464 --> 53:38.549
Yeah.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.217
You know,

53:38.549 --> 53:41.217
I had no idea

53:41.217 --> 53:43.846
that Rebecca she was talking

53:41.217 --> 53:43.846
about the other night

53:43.846 --> 53:45.097
was Rebecca Cole.

53:46.807 --> 53:47.808
Yeah.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.394
You knew her, huh?

53:50.394 --> 53:51.937
Sure.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.314
Some of us around here

53:51.937 --> 53:54.314
are lifers, you know.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.319
Thanks, Lola.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.319
Yeah.

54:02.322 --> 54:03.991
Hey, you find

54:02.322 --> 54:03.991
your girl yet?

54:04.950 --> 54:07.161
Nope.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.205
Police told us to keep

54:07.161 --> 54:09.205
a look out for her,

54:09.205 --> 54:12.416
but she hadn't

54:09.205 --> 54:12.416
been around.

54:12.416 --> 54:14.459
Hey, what's wrong

54:12.416 --> 54:14.459
with her?

54:17.379 --> 54:18.630
I'm not sure.

54:20.049 --> 54:21.217
Hey, thanks.

54:29.141 --> 54:30.475
Thought that

54:29.141 --> 54:30.475
was your truck.

54:34.230 --> 54:36.440
I understand you've been

54:34.230 --> 54:36.440
searching down by the river.

54:38.316 --> 54:40.194
You'll have

54:38.316 --> 54:40.194
to let this one go,

54:38.316 --> 54:40.194
Josh.

54:40.194 --> 54:41.862
Why?

54:41.862 --> 54:43.488
The police afraid I'm going

54:41.862 --> 54:43.488
to find something?

54:43.488 --> 54:44.907
Easy, brother.

54:44.907 --> 54:47.325
It ain't healthy.

54:47.325 --> 54:49.661
Plus they can't let you dig

54:47.325 --> 54:49.661
out there, it's town land.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.122
Hey, Pastor.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.122
Hi, Lola.

54:51.122 --> 54:52.581
Coffee?

54:51.122 --> 54:52.581
Sure.

54:55.084 --> 54:57.628
I stopped by Rebecca Cole's

54:55.084 --> 54:57.628
foster mom's house.

54:58.921 --> 55:01.548
She still had a box of some

54:58.921 --> 55:01.548
of her old things.

55:01.548 --> 55:06.845
Some pictures,

55:01.548 --> 55:06.845
jewelry, books.

55:01.548 --> 55:06.845
Her Bible.

55:06.845 --> 55:08.889
She said Rebecca

55:06.845 --> 55:08.889
had just joined

55:06.845 --> 55:08.889
the Bible study at school.

55:08.889 --> 55:09.932
OK?

55:11.683 --> 55:14.228
"Faith is

55:11.683 --> 55:14.228
the substance

55:11.683 --> 55:14.228
of things hoped for,

55:14.228 --> 55:17.148
evidence of things

55:14.228 --> 55:17.148
not seen."

55:17.148 --> 55:18.649
That verse was highlighted

55:17.148 --> 55:18.649
in her Bible.

55:20.192 --> 55:23.654
It's a verse of hope,

55:20.192 --> 55:23.654
Mark, you know that.

55:23.654 --> 55:26.157
There were dozens highlighted

55:23.654 --> 55:26.157
just like that.

55:26.157 --> 55:27.699
So, what are you saying?

55:27.699 --> 55:29.868
She was healing,

55:27.699 --> 55:29.868
not hurting.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.411
She was having

55:29.868 --> 55:31.411
the best year

55:29.868 --> 55:31.411
of her life.

55:31.411 --> 55:33.538
Sometimes you don't see

55:31.411 --> 55:33.538
the whole picture, Josh.

55:35.082 --> 55:36.708
You can be

55:35.082 --> 55:36.708
on top of the world

55:35.082 --> 55:36.708
the one minute

55:36.708 --> 55:38.752
and the bottom

55:36.708 --> 55:38.752
can fall out in

55:36.708 --> 55:38.752
the next.

55:39.962 --> 55:41.588
You of all people

55:39.962 --> 55:41.588
should know that.

55:43.381 --> 55:45.050
Don't make this

55:43.381 --> 55:45.050
about Hannah.

55:45.050 --> 55:47.427
Josh, I'm sorry.

55:47.427 --> 55:50.097
But I can't help but wonder

55:47.427 --> 55:50.097
if it is about her.

55:51.307 --> 55:52.432
Here's the truth.

55:53.558 --> 55:55.560
The police

55:53.558 --> 55:55.560
gave up on Rebecca.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.771
They saw her as

55:55.560 --> 55:57.771
a troubled kid

55:55.560 --> 55:57.771
and they filed her away.

55:59.355 --> 56:00.565
Josh, please.

56:00.565 --> 56:02.318
Sit and talk a bit.

56:02.318 --> 56:03.944
What's the point?

56:08.573 --> 56:09.908
( sighs )

56:35.893 --> 56:38.979
CHLOE:  Sometimes when you

56:35.893 --> 56:38.979
decide not to give up

56:35.893 --> 56:38.979
on something,

56:40.605 --> 56:42.482
it drives you to pursue it

56:40.605 --> 56:42.482
obsessively.

56:42.482 --> 56:44.109
( metal clanging )

56:50.074 --> 56:52.159
It makes you risk everything.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.537
( metal clanging )

56:59.624 --> 57:02.253
You look for answers.

57:06.257 --> 57:09.176
You look for hope.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.559
There's probably a million

57:15.682 --> 57:17.559
lost explorers

57:17.559 --> 57:20.104
for every one who

57:17.559 --> 57:20.104
finds an answer.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.274
( water sloshes )

57:26.110 --> 57:28.862
Then something comes along

57:26.110 --> 57:28.862
that you didn't expect.

57:30.739 --> 57:32.574
And suddenly...

57:32.574 --> 57:34.034
( dramatic instrumental music )

57:34.034 --> 57:35.869
( thud )

57:38.580 --> 57:40.332
You realize you're

57:38.580 --> 57:40.332
on the right path.

57:46.213 --> 57:49.883
Josh? Josh?

57:53.678 --> 57:54.679
You OK?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.183
I was up on the bridge

57:55.889 --> 57:58.183
and I saw you.

57:58.183 --> 57:59.601
What happened?

57:59.601 --> 58:02.854
Somebody...somebody

57:59.601 --> 58:02.854
came up behind me.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.898
OK, OK.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.898
Can you stand?

58:04.898 --> 58:06.691
I'm fine.

58:07.943 --> 58:09.361
( grunts )

58:10.612 --> 58:11.655
OK.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.954
OK, sit still

58:17.494 --> 58:18.954
for a sec.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.006
My watch.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.466
Don't move.

58:31.633 --> 58:33.135
All right, just...

58:34.594 --> 58:36.263
You know,

58:34.594 --> 58:36.263
you should go to

58:34.594 --> 58:36.263
the hospital.

58:37.306 --> 58:38.349
No.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.602
What were you

58:40.976 --> 58:42.602
doing down here?

58:48.025 --> 58:49.443
I believe you, Chloe.

59:16.428 --> 59:17.888
It's gotta be the one.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.473
You sure?

59:20.557 --> 59:21.558
It's the same.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.352
What about the guy?

59:27.022 --> 59:28.940
You think you

59:27.022 --> 59:28.940
can recognize him?

59:28.940 --> 59:29.941
I mean, if he was

59:28.940 --> 59:29.941
right in front of you,

59:29.941 --> 59:31.402
could you pick him out?

59:33.111 --> 59:34.905
I don't know.

59:45.957 --> 59:47.292
( horn honks )

59:52.339 --> 59:54.132
Hey.

59:52.339 --> 59:54.132
What's up?

59:54.132 --> 59:56.051
I gotta ask you something.

59:56.051 --> 59:58.303
Are you OK?

59:56.051 --> 59:58.303
Yeah, I'm fine.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.930
Look, I was with

59:58.303 --> 59:59.930
Rebecca's foster mom

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.266
and she gave me

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.266
this old photo

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.266
of you two.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.143
I remember this.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.729
Look at Rebecca.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.314
You see that old truck

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.314
in the background?

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.233
You don't know whose truck

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.233
that is by chance, do you?

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.568
A customer, maybe?

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:14.570
Looks like Matt Barnes'

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:14.570
old truck.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.280
I'm not sure, why you asking?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.822
Who's Matt?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.822
He's the night cook.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.324
He was there yesterday

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.324
when you were in.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.534
I'm pretty sure he had

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.534
a truck like that

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.910
before he bought his bike.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.203
Is he at

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.203
the restaurant?

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.288
No, he's got

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.288
the weekends off.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.414
He's sleeping.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.041
Does he live in town?

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.626
Out on Trimmer Road.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.086
Where on Trimmer?

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.546
Gray house past

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.546
the tracks.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:34.172
Are you sure

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:34.172
everything's OK?

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.591
What do you want with

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.591
an old truck anyway?

01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:36.508
It's a long story.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.343
Thanks, Lola.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:39.928
Josh...

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.620
JOSH: You OK?

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.792
They say God can heal

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.792
your broken heart.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.421
But I've never felt Him.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:18.550
He's always seemed

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:18.550
so far away.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.057
I think someone hurt you

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.057
very much.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:28.768
Is that true?

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.148
You can trust me.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.609
I know.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:40.614
You can trust me, Chloe.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.657
I know!

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.210
I never knew my father.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:02:00.217
As long as I can remember,

01:01:55.629 --> 01:02:00.217
it was just my mom and me.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.720
She dated a few guys.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:06.806
Some of them were very nice.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.103
Some of them

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.103
weren't so nice.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:17.067
( sniffs )

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:21.321
I-I didn't like being around

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:21.321
when they were home.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.323
Especially when my mom

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.323
wasn't there.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:30.747
So I would go and hang

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:30.747
down by the river.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.875
Under the bridge.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.840
Does your mom know?

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.966
( scoffs )

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:45.679
That is not on you.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.264
How do you know?

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.349
It's not on you.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:51.309
( tearfully ) How do you know?

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.396
You did nothing wrong.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.317
It's not on you.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.317
It's not on you.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.860
( sobbing )

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.875
It's OK.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.338
It's OK.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.301
Now I need you

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.301
to listen to me.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.096
I think I know

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.096
who drives

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.096
that truck.

01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:32.309
So I think we need

01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:32.309
to take a ride.

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:34.686
OK?

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.397
Can you do that for me?

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:40.484
( sighs ) Yeah.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.818
OK.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.196
( suspenseful music )

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:55.290
CHLOE:  This probably would not

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:55.290
make sense to most people.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.878
Visiting the house of a man

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.878
you think murdered your friend.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.091
But when you've run

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.091
out of options...

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.221
your choices become

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.221
more desperate.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.060
Are you sure you're OK

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.060
with this?

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.673
If you want to hang back,

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.673
it's OK.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.226
( knocking )

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.151
Let's go see if there's

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.151
anything out back.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.502
( knocking )

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:32.929
( knocking )

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:49.654
( knocking )

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.453
( footsteps approaching )

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.955
I don't think

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.955
anyone's around.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.668
You looking for something?

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.171
Look, I knocked.

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:08.840
JOSH: No one answered.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.218
What are you doing here?

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.177
JOSH: All I wanted

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.177
to do was ask you

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.177
about a photo that I found.

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.011
( screams )

01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.054
What?

01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:19.434
Aren't the cops looking for you?

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:26.775
It was you.

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:27.943
What's she saying?

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:29.736
( scream )

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.904
I saw you.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:31.738
What are you saying?

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.615
You killed her.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:34.616
What?

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:35.533
You killed her!

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.118
( screams )

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.286
Killed who?

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.286
JOSH: She's just

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.286
a little confused...

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:39.871
CHLOE: No, I'm not confused!

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:40.956
What are you saying?

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:40.956
You killed her! I saw it!

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.081
Let's go.

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.081
I saw you!

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:44.292
It was you! It was you!

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:47.504
Get off my property!

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:47.504
I'm going to call the cops!

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.298
( panting )

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.638
MAN: Don't ever come back here!

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.473
( gravel crunching )

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.308
( panting )

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.567
Well, I think it's time

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.567
you told the police.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.654
Think you're ready for that?

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.824
Yeah.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.708
( typing )

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.335
Sarge.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.335
Yeah.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:30.338
This kid Josh Griffin's

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:30.338
on his way in.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.841
Said something about how

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.841
this girl Chloe Morey

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:34.801
just identified a guy named

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:34.801
Matt Barnes,

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:37.261
as someone who killed

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:37.261
Rebecca Cole.

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:40.056
(sighs) I got this.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.644
You got people scratching

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.644
their heads, Josh.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.021
JOSH: Sgt. Stanford,

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.021
I can explain.

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.189
Save it.

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.189
Chloe, out of

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.189
the truck.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.691
Look, this Barnes guy,

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.691
he had something to do

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.275
with Rebecca Cole's

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.275
disappearance.

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.819
You gotta listen

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.819
to what

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:52.819
Chloe's saying.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:55.739
Chloe doesn't know

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:55.739
what she's saying.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.657
That's the problem, Josh.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.617
She doesn't know what

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.617
she seeing either.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:01.285
Don't you get that by now?

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.164
Don't make me ask you again

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:05.164
get out of the truck!

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.458
Come on.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.841
You interfere

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.841
with this again,

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:14.841
I'll arrest you.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.091
Now go home.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:35.569
I heard what happened.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.447
I forgot how fast news

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.447
travels around here.

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.616
Josh.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.372
Josh, I'm not really sure

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.372
what to say anymore.

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.630
I'm trying to understand.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.862
You ever feel like God

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.862
failed you?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.453
If I'm honest, yeah.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.832
Sometimes I feel

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.832
that He has.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.754
Especially when it makes

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.754
no sense.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.801
We're all human, Josh.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.179
It's OK to be angry.

01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:47.350
I am so beyond angry, brother.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:56.651
Hannah wasn't keen

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:56.651
on Tanzania.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.321
But I convinced her

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.321
to go overseas.

01:10:03.407 --> 01:10:05.326
When she got sick, we were...

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:09.580
we were too far from anything

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:09.580
to get her help.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.960
I just don't get it.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:19.966
We were doing good work.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:23.344
God's work.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.310
( sobbing )

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:37.108
I get it.

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:42.739
But I believe that

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:42.739
He'll turn this

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.158
into a greater

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.158
purpose for you.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.289
But not in our time, Josh.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.170
In His time.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.219
His time.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.763
( sniffles )

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:25.865
You hungry?

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.409
Can I get you

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.409
something to eat?

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.960
You want to tell me

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.960
why you ran off?

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.633
All right.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.843
I'm going

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.843
to take you to

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.843
the hospital.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:51.641
Are you sure there's nothing

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:51.641
more you want to say?

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:56.479
There's somebody here

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:56.479
who wants to see you.

01:12:02.277 --> 01:12:03.402
Hey, baby.

01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.704
We don't have to talk about it

01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.704
if you don't want to.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.669
No matter what,

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.669
I'm not going

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.669
to leave you.

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:25.716
OK.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:28.928
CHLOE: Part of me

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:28.928
wanted to tell her

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:28.928
everything I knew.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.680
( box thuds )

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:36.435
I wish I felt safe enough.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.606
It's a powerless feeling

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.358
when you don't trust

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.358
your own thoughts.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:46.529
Even if I could figure out

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.615
the exact mix of fact

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.615
and fiction,

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.077
I wasn't going to tell anyone.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.462
But just when I thought

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.462
I was about to lose it all,

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.550
one more thing happened

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.550
that I can't explain.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:13.472
And it changed everything.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:17.894
It saved my life.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.150
NICOLE: Is everything okay?

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.027
Matt Barnes.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.780
That's a name that

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.780
hasn't popped up

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.742
on my radar in years.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:38.956
But it popped up once back

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:38.956
when he was...younger.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.917
STANFORD:  Before he

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.917
started working

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.917
at the diner.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.713
Sexual assault charge.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:50.343
That was... 14 years ago.

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:56.432
Even then....he had that,

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.601
that 'LOST SOUL' tattoo.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:03.398
( motorcycle revs )

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:07.360
STANFORD:  Why don't we take

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:07.360
a ride to the bridge

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.487
and you can show me

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.487
what you think happened.

01:14:10.487 --> 01:14:11.822
Are you up for that?

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.616
Yeah.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.077
( shoveling dirt )

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:32.302
Whatcha doing?

01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:40.476
Looking for something.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.729
Same thing you were looking

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.729
for on my property earlier?

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.398
Nope.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.442
I found that.

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:50.820
I'm looking for something else.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.990
That girl, she's got you

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.990
all twisted around.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.366
Yet you're here.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.744
You worried

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.744
about something?

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:03.499
Well, maybe I'm worried

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:03.499
about you.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.336
A lot of bad things happen

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.336
in these woods.

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:13.343
People fall down, slip,

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:13.343
hit their head real hard.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:19.182
Real easy

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:19.182
to end up face down

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:19.182
in that river.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.184
Yeah, I'm sure you know

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.184
all about that.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.978
There is nothing

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.978
out here, Josh.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.271
She saw you.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.107
She's an eyewitness.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.360
She's crazy.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.820
And ain't nobody believe

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.820
what she says.

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:37.450
So please, Josh, go home.

01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:39.743
I believe her.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.582
And as soon as I find Rebecca,

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.582
wherever you put her,

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:47.168
a lot of other people

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:47.168
are gonna...

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:48.211

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.016
( groaning )

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.482
Hey! What's going on down there?

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:10.525
( grunts )

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:16.906
( coughs ) You're not

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:16.906
gonna find nothing!

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:19.742
( footsteps )

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:26.665
STANFORD: Was that Barnes?

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:26.665
Yeah.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.712
Yeah, dispatch this is Stanford.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.131
I need a couple of units out at

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.131
the Trimmer Road Bridge.

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:35.799
Need to track down

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:35.799
a possible suspect

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:38.302
who ran off into the woods,

01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:38.302
white male...

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.803
( police radio noises )

01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:00.699
What if they

01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:00.699
don't find her?

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:05.121
They'll find her.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:14.630
Maybe it's time someone

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:14.630
else knew the truth.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.354
Mom.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.650
I need to

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.650

OK.

CHLOE: Josh was right.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.453
I was punishing her

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.453
with my silence.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.206

come sometimes.

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:09.310
This is where I felt safe.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.313
Safe from what?

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.194
Chloe, you can feel

Does this look familiar?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.642
(whispers) It was Rebecca's.

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:56.602

I've got to go find Matt Barnes.

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:11.534
It's a good thing you didn't

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:11.534
give up on her, little brother.

01:21:21.836 --> 01:21:24.254
You're going

arrested Matt Barnes

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:38.935
for the murder of Rebecca Cole.

01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:44.900
Her remains were found just

01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:44.900
a few feet away from her cross.

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:50.447
The psychologist that

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:50.447
interviewed me said

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.032
that I'd probably had been

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:55.160
gathering clues about him

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:55.160
for years.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.913
That while my mind blocked out

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.913
the memory of what happened,

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:03.001
it was also taking inventory

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:03.001
of everything about him.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.881
They said that my testimony

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.881
would make it

01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:08.591
an open and shut case.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:13.053

Hey.

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:16.909
Thought you might want

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:16.909
some company for lunch.

Sure.

Is everything OK?

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.292
Yeah, I'm all caught up

on my school work.

Um, look.

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:36.052

How are you doing, Mom?

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.773
I'll be better once I know

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.773
you are.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.109
I'm not there yet...

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:56.532
and I don't know how long

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:56.532
it's going to take me.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.576
But I'm not going to let this

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.576
own me or define me.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.331
And I don't want it

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.331
to own you

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.331
or define you either.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.418
We need to make this

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.418
a new start for both of us.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.754
I want that too.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.263
Shall we go?

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.059
I think this is going

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.059
to be really good.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:25.519
I think so too.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:31.692
Everybody's loving

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:31.692
your work, Josh.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.865
Really, really nice.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.035
Well, that's good.

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.538
Here's the rest

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.538
of my bill.

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.751
Sticking around for service?

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:51.211
Nah, got a date

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:51.211
with a shower.

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.880
Tomorrow then.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.676
Josh, I was wrong to push you

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:57.676
so hard to open up.

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:01.013
As a pastor, I'm supposed

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:01.013
to take

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.973
the, "I'm here for you if you

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.973
need me" approach,

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:05.851
but it was hard seeing you

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:05.851
hurting like that.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.395
It's okay. I get it.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:10.981
You're my brother.

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:14.735
Same rules don't apply.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.946
Time for you

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.946
to do your thing,

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.946
Pastor.

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:25.161
Josh?

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.792
Thought I might

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.792
find you here.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:30.793
How you doing?

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:32.920
You look good.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.715
I feel good.

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:39.426
Thank you.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:40.510
You're welcome.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:46.892
No, thank you...

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:46.892
for believing in me.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:52.606
You had the eyes to see

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:52.606
the truth when no one else did.

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:55.233
Who was it that taught you to

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:55.233
see with your heart like that?

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.281
I'm beginning

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.281
to understand

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:01.281
that sometimes

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:04.200
you have to hit rock bottom

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:04.200
before you can see the top.

01:26:05.119 --> 01:26:06.161
Yeah.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.840
You really think faith can play

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.840
a part in healing someone?

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:23.679
Yeah.

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:27.724
CHLOE:  My name is Chloe.

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.436
I'm 20.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.481
I still have a hard time

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.274
letting people get

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.274
too close to me.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:40.029
But each day I get better.

01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:46.118
And I'm open to trusting more,

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:50.539
trusting that things will

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:50.539
work out for me.

01:26:51.999 --> 01:26:54.084
That all my scars

01:26:51.999 --> 01:26:54.084
will start to fade.

01:26:57.046 --> 01:27:01.508
And then perhaps as they fade,

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:04.553
I'll be set free.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.974
I'll finally feel free.
