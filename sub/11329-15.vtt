WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:04.700
nager...

00:04.700 --> 00:05.993
What's going on?
I started my period.
I'm not pregnant.

00:06.027 --> 00:07.862
Are you sure you want
to get back with Ben

00:07.896 --> 00:09.663
even after he and Adrian
were together?

00:09.698 --> 00:11.532
We're moving.
Is there any possibility

00:11.566 --> 00:13.834
you could stay with a friend
your senior year of high school?

00:13.869 --> 00:15.469
Ben, Adrian is pregnant,

00:15.504 --> 00:17.104
and if she told you
she isn't, she lied.

00:17.139 --> 00:19.306
I got accepted
into a summer program

00:19.341 --> 00:20.841
at the Nomkomf School
of Music in New York.

00:20.876 --> 00:23.144
Adrian's pregnant,
and it's my baby.

00:23.178 --> 00:25.045
I don't want you and Ricky
to be anywhere near each other.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.380
I am moving.

00:26.414 --> 00:27.615
Maybe I could crash with you.

00:27.649 --> 00:29.784
I can't believe I have
my own apartment in New York.

00:29.818 --> 00:32.353
Tomorrow I'm going
to have the abortion.

00:32.387 --> 00:34.622
We can't, Ashley.
We can if we want.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.659
I changed my mind.
I couldn't do it.

00:38.693 --> 00:39.960
We're having a baby.

00:39.995 --> 00:41.495
I violated my parole.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.998
I have to turn myself in
to county women's prison.

00:44.032 --> 00:46.667
We're gonna go to New York,
and you're gonna see Amy,
and you're gonna tell her.

00:46.701 --> 00:48.502
Amy, Adrian's pregnant,
and it's my baby.

00:49.838 --> 00:52.339
Who's that?
That's my husband.

00:52.374 --> 00:54.341
Maybe you should start
a business of your own.

00:54.376 --> 00:55.342
I would love to.

00:55.377 --> 00:56.677
I hope I get to see you again.

00:56.711 --> 00:57.878
Give me a call.

00:57.913 --> 00:59.880
I want to be a doctor.
I want to be a doctor.

00:59.915 --> 01:02.149
Ricky's flying to New York
to see Amy this weekend.

01:02.184 --> 01:04.385
It's really good
to see you, Amy.

01:04.419 --> 01:07.855
You're not gonna see Jack
anymore, and that is it.

01:07.889 --> 01:09.523
What would happen if Amy
and Ricky thought

01:09.558 --> 01:10.991
that we were gonna
be unavailab to them?

01:11.026 --> 01:13.494
I actually think you may be
ready to make a commitment.

01:13.528 --> 01:16.831
I just said
I slept with another woman
after telling Amy I wouldn't.

01:16.865 --> 01:19.633
I don't think Amy's ever
gonna be able to stop you
from being with other girls,

01:19.668 --> 01:21.168
and you two really
shouldn't be together.

01:21.203 --> 01:22.636
Tell your mom thanks
for inviting me over.

01:22.671 --> 01:24.338
I just can't figure out
why she let you

01:24.372 --> 01:25.840
come over here
in the middle of the night.

01:25.874 --> 01:27.875
Would you and John
like to go out with me tonight?

01:27.909 --> 01:29.310
We would love to.

01:29.344 --> 01:31.545
I don't care if Ben
gives the ring to Adrian

01:31.580 --> 01:34.381
as a friendship ring
or any other kind of ring.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.852
Do you know how much
that thing is worth?
$50,000.

01:37.886 --> 01:40.020
I am not gonna have sex
with you, Ashley.

01:40.055 --> 01:42.523
Why not?
I don't want to be
the first guy you sleep with.

01:42.557 --> 01:43.958
We shouldn't
be married, George.

01:43.992 --> 01:45.826
Well, we'll see how
we can best split up.

01:45.861 --> 01:48.529
Please don't run off
to med camp and have sex.

01:48.563 --> 01:52.032
I think you should know
that I'm thinking
about marrying Adrian.

01:52.067 --> 01:54.501
How would you
like to be vice president?

01:54.536 --> 01:55.536
Of what?

01:55.570 --> 01:56.904
I'm happy to have you home.

01:56.938 --> 01:58.405
And I'm happy to be home.

02:34.442 --> 02:35.876
I'm in charge
of school lunches.

02:35.911 --> 02:37.978
Snacks.
These are just my snacks.

02:38.013 --> 02:39.580
Oh, of course.
Snacks.

02:40.749 --> 02:42.349
For the week?

02:42.384 --> 02:44.018
No. I eat every two hours.

02:44.052 --> 02:46.020
That's how I keep
my weight down.

02:46.054 --> 02:47.588
Except on your fingers.

02:47.622 --> 02:49.790
I'm picking up your ring
that had to be resized.

02:49.824 --> 02:52.092
It's water retention.
It's totally normal.

02:52.127 --> 02:54.695
Of course.
We'll get it resized
as many times as we have to.

02:58.099 --> 02:59.266
Adrian.

02:59.301 --> 03:01.602
Look at you.
You look great.

03:01.636 --> 03:02.603
Hey, Ben.

03:02.637 --> 03:03.938
Doesn't she look great?

03:03.972 --> 03:06.240
She does.
How are you feeling?

03:06.274 --> 03:08.575
Happy.
I'm feeling really happy.

03:08.610 --> 03:11.779
That's good.
You look happy.
You both look happy.

03:11.813 --> 03:12.947
So do you.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.949
Why do you look so happy?
What did you do?

03:15.951 --> 03:18.719
Nothing. Have a good
first day of school.

03:18.753 --> 03:20.554
Bye.

03:27.095 --> 03:29.229
What?
Today's the day.

03:29.264 --> 03:31.932
I know. I can't wait.
I can't wait.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.934
Can't wait for what?
What's going on?

03:33.969 --> 03:35.436
Oh, wow.

03:35.470 --> 03:37.771
Well, I haven't seen you
in a few weeks.

03:37.806 --> 03:41.275
You've gotten--
A glow since we saw you.
You are glowing.

03:41.309 --> 03:42.743
Oh.

03:42.777 --> 03:44.111
You're not having twins,
are you?

03:44.145 --> 03:45.546
No, I'm not.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.481
I'm almost halfway
through the pregnancy,

03:47.515 --> 03:48.949
so I'm supposed
to look like this.

03:48.984 --> 03:51.919
She's supposed
to look like that. Okay?

03:53.000 --> 03:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.329 --> 04:03.230
She's only halfway?

04:03.264 --> 04:05.599
Oh, I know
what that means.

04:07.669 --> 04:09.603
Hi!
Hi!

04:09.637 --> 04:11.605
So good to see you.

04:11.639 --> 04:13.140
How do I look?

04:13.174 --> 04:15.843
You look like
you're having a baby.
Soon.

04:15.877 --> 04:17.577
20 weeks.
I'm halfway there.

04:17.612 --> 04:19.413
Oh, we get to find out
the sex of the baby today.

04:19.447 --> 04:21.315
So it's "we," huh?

04:21.349 --> 04:22.316
Yep.

04:22.350 --> 04:23.484
Nice.

04:23.518 --> 04:24.985
And how's everything
with you?

04:25.020 --> 04:26.487
Or is it "you two"?

04:27.522 --> 04:29.590
Oh, no, no.
I'm still with Grant.

04:29.624 --> 04:31.959
But we had a great summer.
I can't wait to tell you
about it.

04:31.993 --> 04:34.361
You wouldn't tell me.
No, I wouldn't,

04:34.396 --> 04:36.130
but that's because it's really
none of your business.

04:36.164 --> 04:38.332
But I appreciate
your interest in me.

04:44.172 --> 04:46.140
We learned to do that
at med camp this summer--

04:46.174 --> 04:48.709
how to deliver bad news
but end on a good note.

04:49.911 --> 04:52.346
Oh.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.982
What's up, dude?
Hey, dude.

04:57.552 --> 04:59.686
Well, just because Ricky
says he hasn't had sex

04:59.721 --> 05:01.989
doesn't mean that he hasn't
had sex all summer.

05:02.023 --> 05:04.258
And just because Jack
says he hasn't had sex

05:04.292 --> 05:06.894
doesn't mean he hasn't
had sex all summer either.

05:06.928 --> 05:09.029
Same goes for Jesse.
I didn't say anything.

05:09.064 --> 05:10.731
And I haven't even talked
to Jesse yet.

05:11.766 --> 05:13.534
Did you have sex this summer?

05:13.568 --> 05:15.202
With who? No.

05:15.236 --> 05:18.072
Excuse me.
Do you mind?

05:18.106 --> 05:20.007
Good morning.

05:21.342 --> 05:23.544
The three of you talk about
anything other than sex?

05:23.578 --> 05:25.012
Sometimes.

05:25.046 --> 05:26.380
Do they know what
our agreement is?

05:26.414 --> 05:29.049
Of course they do.
They're my best friends.

05:29.084 --> 05:33.220
What they don't know is
I'm ready to have sex with you.

05:34.789 --> 05:36.857
So maybe you should
go get tested.

05:36.891 --> 05:39.359
Oh, come on, Amy.
You know I don't have anything.

05:39.394 --> 05:41.328
You don't even know
if you have anything.

05:41.362 --> 05:42.863
So find out,
and we'll go from there.

Nothing. And I mean that.
Nothing.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.654
I have to ask you something.

06:17.689 --> 06:20.390
You don't have any sexually
transmitted infections

06:20.425 --> 06:22.492
or HIV or anything,
do you?

06:22.527 --> 06:26.163
If I do, I'm sure
it's from being with you.

06:26.197 --> 06:27.631
That was a no, right?

06:29.434 --> 06:31.501
Hey, Candy, wait up.
I gotta ask you something.

06:31.536 --> 06:33.003
I'm not interested.

06:33.037 --> 06:34.171
I'm not interested either.

06:34.205 --> 06:36.173
Yeah. I heard
you're with Amy now.

06:36.207 --> 06:38.175
With? No, I'm not with her.
We're just dating.

06:38.209 --> 06:40.010
Oh, you date now,
do you?

06:40.044 --> 06:41.678
Yeah. What I wanted
to ask you is

06:41.713 --> 06:43.347
have you ever had any STIs?

06:43.381 --> 06:45.716
Nothing permanent,
but thanks for asking.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.351
But you didn't when we--
No, I didn't.

06:47.385 --> 06:48.552
What about--
No.

06:50.588 --> 06:53.223
That's quite a survey
you're taking.

06:53.257 --> 06:57.027
But I think the point is
to ask the question before
and not after.

06:57.061 --> 06:59.830
Yeah, well, since you know
I'm asking...

06:59.864 --> 07:02.566
We used a condom.
You should be fine.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.034
I should be, yeah.

07:04.068 --> 07:06.036
You don't have any symptoms
or anything, do you?

07:06.070 --> 07:07.571
No.

07:07.605 --> 07:09.806
Well, the only way
you're gonna know for sure

07:09.841 --> 07:11.675
is if you actually
go see a doctor.

07:11.709 --> 07:13.443
I realize that.
I'd just like to know

07:13.478 --> 07:15.545
what my chances are
before I go to a doctor.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.681
Well, I would say
the chances are pretty good

07:17.715 --> 07:19.916
that you'd have something.

07:19.951 --> 07:21.651
Even if it's just a minor,

07:21.686 --> 07:24.388
unheard-of sexually
transmitted something,

07:24.422 --> 07:26.390
because you've slept
with everyone,

07:26.424 --> 07:29.760
and that means you've slept with
everyone everyone's slept with,

07:29.794 --> 07:33.630
and that adds up
to hundreds of people.

07:33.664 --> 07:37.234
So...good luck.

07:50.782 --> 07:52.749
I heard Dr. Bink left,

07:52.784 --> 07:55.685
but I have a gift
I wanted to get to her.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.921
She got me into a program
in New York this past summer

07:57.955 --> 07:59.589
that kind of changed my life.

07:59.624 --> 08:01.391
No kidding?

08:01.426 --> 08:03.393
I hope I can
change some lives.

08:03.428 --> 08:05.395
That's really wonderful.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.397
Wait. Is that true?

08:07.432 --> 08:09.733
Changed your life? Wow.

08:09.767 --> 08:13.170
Yeah. It's true.
She changed my life.

08:13.204 --> 08:16.773
Or that program
that she tricked me into
changed my life.

08:16.808 --> 08:18.642
But I just wanted
to say thank you.

08:18.676 --> 08:21.344
I'm really grateful
for everything she did for me.

08:21.379 --> 08:24.281
Could I get an address for her?
Or could you send this to her?

08:24.315 --> 08:27.417
I think I can get you
her new work address.
I think that would be allowed.

08:27.452 --> 08:29.419
All right. Thank you.

08:29.454 --> 08:31.455
Nice to meet you.

08:32.457 --> 08:35.292
You, too, whoever you are.

08:35.326 --> 08:36.793
Oh, that's really no one.

08:36.828 --> 08:38.794
No one you should
be concerned about anyway.

08:38.830 --> 08:41.597
Are you
the new counselor?
Yes. I'm Katelyn O'Malley.

08:41.631 --> 08:43.166
Oh, just
the last name, please.

08:43.201 --> 08:44.601
This is about
actual school business.

08:44.635 --> 08:47.437
All right. I'm Ms. O'Malley.
And you are?

08:47.472 --> 08:49.773
Ashley Juergens.
You mind?

08:53.678 --> 08:56.213
I just need to get some forms
for home schooling.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.748
Oh, I love home schooling.

08:58.783 --> 09:01.051
Do you have someone to act
as your teacher at home?

09:01.085 --> 09:04.054
Oh, I don't need a teacher.
I'm gonna do it myself.

09:04.088 --> 09:06.890
Oh. That's interesting.

09:06.924 --> 09:08.558
Were you enrolled here
last year?

09:08.593 --> 09:09.559
Yes.

09:09.594 --> 09:10.894
It was not
a good experience?

09:10.928 --> 09:12.028
No.

09:12.063 --> 09:14.264
Tell me about it.
Why?

09:14.298 --> 09:16.266
I just thought
that if you told me

09:16.300 --> 09:18.268
what you didn't like
about going to school here,

09:18.302 --> 09:20.270
maybe I could
help fix the problem

09:20.304 --> 09:22.239
or help you deal with it.

09:22.273 --> 09:24.741
I don't like the teachers
or the students.

09:24.775 --> 09:26.910
I don't like the lockers
or the hallways

09:26.944 --> 09:30.046
or the classrooms
or the lunchroom,

09:30.081 --> 09:32.315
and I don't like the rules
or the regulations

09:32.350 --> 09:35.352
or the requirements
or the report cards,

09:35.386 --> 09:37.354
and I hate--

09:37.388 --> 09:39.489
I absolutely hate--

09:39.524 --> 09:41.558
anyone who thinks
she can help me.

09:43.794 --> 09:47.364
Okay. Well, then, um,
here's the form.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.699
Just fill it out
and get it back to me,

09:49.734 --> 09:51.268
and we'll get you
all set up,

09:51.302 --> 09:53.870
if this is really
what you want to do.

09:53.905 --> 09:56.606
This is really
what I want to do.

10:00.478 --> 10:04.381
I have been here 15 minutes,
and I have already lost one.

10:04.415 --> 10:07.083
Yeah, this is going well.

10:08.085 --> 10:11.054
Hi, Ashley.
Good to see you.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.622
How are things at home?

10:12.657 --> 10:14.357
Awesome.

10:15.459 --> 10:17.627
Ashley, wait up.
Come on. We're friends.

10:19.630 --> 10:21.965
Forget it.
She had a tough summer.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.500
And she doesn't think
you're friends.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.302
You couldn't answer
her text messages?

10:25.336 --> 10:27.704
I didn't know her parents
were divorced for real
until you told me,

10:27.738 --> 10:29.706
and then she wouldn't
answer my text messages.

10:29.740 --> 10:31.341
She's not that easy
to be friends with, you know?

10:31.375 --> 10:33.643
Believe me, I know.

10:33.678 --> 10:35.812
So how's Peter?
Peter's great.

10:37.782 --> 10:40.850
Tom is vice president
of human resources?

10:40.885 --> 10:42.485
He hires people?

10:42.520 --> 10:45.155
No, he diminishes
the potential for lawsuits.

10:45.189 --> 10:46.823
His boss says he has
a real talent for it.

10:46.857 --> 10:48.592
What does that mean?
I don't know.

10:48.626 --> 10:50.093
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Griffin.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.996
Grace. Adrian.

10:54.599 --> 10:55.999
Wow.

10:58.502 --> 10:59.836
Hey.
Hey.

10:59.870 --> 11:02.672
Okay, I hope you two know
that if you're having sex,

11:02.707 --> 11:04.507
this is what can happen.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.343
We are well aware.

11:06.377 --> 11:08.144
And we're not.
We're waiting.

11:08.179 --> 11:09.646
We waited, anyway.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.514
I'll see you later.
Yeah.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.317
You want to talk
to your mom tonight?

11:14.352 --> 11:16.820
I mean, we waited,
so technically,

11:16.854 --> 11:18.822
I think we're good to go.

11:18.856 --> 11:20.824
And I feel good
that we kept our promise
this summer.

11:20.858 --> 11:23.760
Me, too.
And I feel even better
that the summer's over.

11:23.794 --> 11:26.296
Yep. Summer's over.

11:34.739 --> 11:36.206
I'm sorry. What?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.108
I met him at work,
and we just clicked.

11:38.142 --> 11:40.010
You clicked how?
You had sex with him?

11:40.044 --> 11:42.479
No, I haven't had sex with him.
I haven't even been out
with him.

11:42.513 --> 11:44.848
But I am gonna go out with him.
I just have to ask my dad.

11:44.882 --> 11:46.549
I didn't do anything all summer.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.485
I didn't go out with anyone.
I didn't do anything.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.954
Well, I didn't
do anything either.
You met someone.

11:50.988 --> 11:52.656
Well, maybe I was destined
to meet someone.

11:52.690 --> 11:54.991
Were you also destined
to have sex with someone?

11:55.026 --> 11:57.127
And by that, I mean some guy
other than me?

11:58.729 --> 12:00.030
Uh-oh.

12:00.064 --> 12:03.800
Yeah.
Doesn't look good.

12:03.834 --> 12:07.270
Well, thivgs happen.

12:07.304 --> 12:08.638
What things?

12:10.207 --> 12:11.975
What is up with you?

12:12.009 --> 12:13.309
And what "things"?

12:13.344 --> 12:16.746
It's just that, you know,

12:16.781 --> 12:20.183
people who meet in high school
don't always stay together,
you know?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.551
What people?

12:21.585 --> 12:25.355
Lauren, it's not that
I did anything this summer,

12:25.389 --> 12:27.357
and it's not that
I met anyone.

12:27.391 --> 12:28.825
But I'm a senior this year,

12:28.859 --> 12:32.028
and then I'll probably be going
away to school next year, and...

12:32.063 --> 12:33.329
And what?

12:36.067 --> 12:37.534
The thing is--

12:37.568 --> 12:39.936
Just stop right there.

12:39.970 --> 12:42.405
I got it.

12:56.754 --> 12:56.786
Shouldn't I
be asking you that?

12:58.456 --> 13:00.156
Probably.

13:06.931 --> 13:09.299
Did I scare you
by asking you to get tested?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.000
Going back to
your old habits instead?

13:11.035 --> 13:14.003
I'm not going back
to my old habits.

13:14.038 --> 13:16.172
I can still talk
to other women, right?

13:16.207 --> 13:19.542
Right. What are you
talking to them about?

13:19.577 --> 13:21.344
What do you think
I'm talking to them about?

13:21.378 --> 13:23.747
I don't know.

13:23.781 --> 13:27.250
I'm not accepting
personal testimony.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.119
I'm gonna need actual proof--

13:29.153 --> 13:31.221
a medical test
from a legitimate source.

13:32.890 --> 13:34.691
And it doesn't have to
be right away.

13:34.725 --> 13:37.894
When you're ready.
When you want to take
that next step with me.

13:37.928 --> 13:39.496
I don't want to get tested,

13:39.530 --> 13:41.664
so maybe we just go back
to the way things were

13:41.699 --> 13:43.099
and forget this
stupid dating thing.

13:43.134 --> 13:45.568
Maybe we shouldn't even
think about having sex.

13:45.603 --> 13:47.103
We don't have to have sex.

13:47.138 --> 13:50.540
But I want to
have sex with you...
at some point.

13:51.909 --> 13:54.477
But it's up to you.

13:54.512 --> 13:57.113
And I don't really want to
go back to how things were.

13:57.148 --> 13:59.149
I don't even think
that's possible.

13:59.183 --> 14:01.117
I think something better
is possible.

14:02.653 --> 14:05.421
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm gonna need a ride home.

14:07.391 --> 14:09.325
Something better is possible.

14:15.633 --> 14:18.601
And by "something better,"
she doesn't just mean sex,

14:18.636 --> 14:19.969
she means marriage.

14:29.004 --> 14:32.507
I can work the counter.
If you want it,
it's all yours.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.475
Today's the day, you know?

14:34.510 --> 14:35.677
What day?

14:35.711 --> 14:37.912
The day you both actually work?

14:37.947 --> 14:39.948
Could this be the day?

14:39.982 --> 14:42.317
We find out the sex
of the baby today.

14:42.351 --> 14:44.385
Oh, do you?
Would you like me to go

14:44.420 --> 14:46.688
and videotape that for you
like you did with Amy?

14:46.722 --> 14:48.823
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

14:48.857 --> 14:52.026
I haven't. I'm gonna have
that videotape for the rest
of John's life.

14:52.061 --> 14:53.995
You might want to
transfer it to DVD.

14:54.029 --> 14:55.530
And I'm sure at some point
you'll thank me.

14:55.564 --> 14:58.032
I doubt it.
Well, John will.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.368
Your son will.
And you seem awfully cranky.

15:00.402 --> 15:02.337
Not having sex
not working out for you?

15:02.371 --> 15:03.705
It's gonna work out for me.

15:03.739 --> 15:05.873
Really? Because
it didn't work out for you

15:05.908 --> 15:07.208
the last time
you had sex with Amy.

15:07.242 --> 15:08.476
Yeah, actually, it did.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.178
Oh, I see.
Then I guess it worked out

15:10.212 --> 15:12.680
for Adrian and me, too,
because we're also
having a baby.

15:12.715 --> 15:15.883
Yeah, anyone can see that.
Even blind people can see that.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.685
Is that a remark
about Adrian's girth?

15:17.720 --> 15:19.187
Her what?

15:19.221 --> 15:22.590
All right.
This is not the day
you're going to work.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.159
That day is yet to come.
Bye, Ben.

15:25.194 --> 15:27.528
It is?
Good-bye!

15:27.563 --> 15:29.864
Fine with me.
I can leave?
Yes, you can leave.

15:29.898 --> 15:33.301
Great. I'll have time
to go by and pick up the camera
and pick up Adrian, and--

15:33.335 --> 15:34.869
I can't wait
to show you the DVD.

15:34.903 --> 15:37.305
Yeah. We can't wait
to see it.

15:38.574 --> 15:40.608
Where were you before
you came in here just now?

15:40.643 --> 15:42.210
Where was I?
Mm-hmm.

15:42.244 --> 15:45.913
I took the trash out.
We take the trash out
at the end of the day.

15:45.948 --> 15:48.650
"We," meaning you.
I had to make a few phone calls.

15:48.684 --> 15:51.386
I know you have a rule
about that, but I had
to talk to some people.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.055
What people are more important
than your job?

15:54.089 --> 15:56.224
Girls I slept with.

15:56.258 --> 15:57.925
I have to get tested.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.561
Amy's not gonna have sex with me
unless I get tested.

16:00.596 --> 16:03.564
Unless you're having sex
during work hours,

16:03.599 --> 16:06.100
I don't really need to know
about that, all right?

16:06.135 --> 16:08.569
Just go.
Go do what you gotta do.

16:08.604 --> 16:11.372
Just get tested.

16:11.407 --> 16:13.808
You can make all
the phone calls you want,

16:13.842 --> 16:15.576
but the only way
you're really gonna know

16:15.611 --> 16:17.745
is if you
actually get tested.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.281
I know that.
I just don't know
if I want to, all right?

16:20.315 --> 16:22.350
Well, I don't know
if anybody wants to.

16:22.384 --> 16:25.286
But if you dance,
you pay the piper.
In English?

16:25.320 --> 16:28.289
If you have sex
with multiple partners,

16:28.323 --> 16:29.957
sooner or later
you're gonna find yourself

16:29.992 --> 16:32.093
in this situation,
unfortunately.

16:33.962 --> 16:37.265
Go. I'm sure
everything's just fine.

16:45.074 --> 16:46.774
Hey, Dad.
Oh, hey, Ames.

16:46.809 --> 16:48.609
Hey, John. Want to help
Grandpa make dinner?

16:48.644 --> 16:52.280
I have homework.
But we can spend
some time with you.

16:52.314 --> 16:54.282
Go spend time with yourself.
Better to do it now

16:54.316 --> 16:55.983
than when you're my age
or your mother's.

16:56.018 --> 16:58.553
You know,
if you want to go out,

16:58.587 --> 17:00.221
go out.

17:00.255 --> 17:02.190
Ashley and I
are perfectly capable

17:02.224 --> 17:04.425
of making a sandwich
or ordering a pizza.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.127
You don't have to cook
every night.

17:06.161 --> 17:08.262
It's a school night.
I promised your mother
I'd stay home

17:08.297 --> 17:10.330
until you and Ashley
graduate high school,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

17:10.365 --> 17:12.266
I don't think she meant
you should never
go out of the house.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.534
I think she did.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.903
Ashley may never even graduate
from high school.

17:15.938 --> 17:17.805
She signed up
for home schooling.
I know that,

17:17.839 --> 17:20.241
and I'm okay
with home schooling if she's
okay with home schooling.

17:20.275 --> 17:23.310
If that's what she wants to do,
and that's what's right for her,
then fine by me.

17:23.345 --> 17:25.179
I'm unflappable.
You can't flap me.

17:26.214 --> 17:27.815
I asked Ricky
to get tested.

17:27.849 --> 17:29.183
For what?

17:29.218 --> 17:30.718
For you know what.

17:30.753 --> 17:31.853
Because?

17:31.887 --> 17:33.654
Because we might have sex.

17:33.689 --> 17:35.490
I might have sex with him
at some point.

17:35.524 --> 17:37.158
You two are gonna have sex?

17:37.192 --> 17:38.526
Eventually. Probably.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.528
Interesting.
"Interesting"?

17:40.562 --> 17:42.363
That's all you have to say
about that, "interesting"?

17:42.397 --> 17:45.867
Well, I guess it's your decision
whether or not to have sex--
yours and Ricky's.

17:45.901 --> 17:48.169
I guess it is.

17:49.605 --> 17:52.073
And suppose he tests positive
for something? What then?

17:52.107 --> 17:54.075
Then we deal with it.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.576
There are treatments
for most everything.

17:55.611 --> 17:56.878
Not herpes, not HIV.

17:56.912 --> 17:59.347
There may not be a cure,
but there are treatments.

17:59.381 --> 18:02.850
Surely to God, you're not
gonna put your life at risk
after having a baby at 15?

18:02.885 --> 18:05.019
No. That's why I'm asking him
to get tested.

18:05.053 --> 18:08.222
What makes you think he will?
I think he will at some point.

18:08.257 --> 18:09.957
The point he wants
to have sex with you.
Yeah.

18:09.992 --> 18:11.726
And I want to
have sex with him.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.361
I don't mean
right away, but--

18:13.395 --> 18:14.796
But you don't mean
when you're married either.

18:14.830 --> 18:16.597
Maybe I do.
You want to get married
in high school?

18:16.632 --> 18:18.199
I have a baby,
and I'm in high school.

18:20.235 --> 18:22.036
All right. Well,

18:22.070 --> 18:24.739
would you have sex with him
if you knew you were never
gonna be married to him?

18:24.773 --> 18:25.907
No, probably not.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.342
Well, he's just not
the marrying type, Ames.

18:28.377 --> 18:30.344
I think you know that.
I do not know that,

18:30.379 --> 18:32.747
and you certainly
don't know that.

18:32.781 --> 18:34.348
All right.

18:34.383 --> 18:36.350
You're probably gonna
get married one day, right?

18:36.385 --> 18:38.719
If not to Ricky,
to some other guy?
Yeah. I hope so.

18:38.754 --> 18:42.056
I mean, it's not
my first concern, but, yeah,
I probably will get married.

18:42.090 --> 18:45.259
Wouldn't it be nice if
the first, last and only guy you
sleep with is the guy you marry?

18:45.294 --> 18:48.896
Yeah, really nice,
which is why I feel comfortable
with my decision to do this.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.932
You forgot that I
already had sex with him,
didn't you?

18:50.966 --> 18:52.633
Yeah.

18:52.668 --> 18:56.304
Sometimes I forget, too.

18:56.338 --> 18:59.607
But you're getting good
at having these conversations.

19:00.976 --> 19:04.045
I mean, if I hadn't already
had sex with Ricky,

19:04.079 --> 19:06.247
you would've made a good point--
a really good point.

19:14.489 --> 19:15.456
Hi.

19:15.490 --> 19:16.624
Hi.

19:18.126 --> 19:20.795
I'm wondering if I
could get a test

19:20.829 --> 19:23.931
for HIV and some other things.

19:23.966 --> 19:26.100
Sure. Not a problem.
Just have a seat over there,

19:26.134 --> 19:28.803
and a counselor
will be right with you.

19:30.839 --> 19:33.474
What is wrong with me?

19:33.508 --> 19:35.142
I hope nothing.

19:45.791 --> 19:48.960
Well, I would've
come with you.

19:48.994 --> 19:50.795
I don't need my mommy
to come with me

19:50.829 --> 19:52.797
to get this kind
of test, all right?

19:52.831 --> 19:54.933
Today's not the day
you work here.

19:54.967 --> 19:58.303
Well, I switched days
with someone this week,
all right?

19:58.337 --> 20:00.672
And you know you could've
gone over to Shakur's office.

20:00.706 --> 20:03.141
He would've had this test.
He's a surgeon.

20:03.175 --> 20:05.910
I'm not having anything
cut off. I hope.

20:05.945 --> 20:09.414
I wasn't planning on telling
my mommy or my daddy.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.849
Geez. Amy.

20:11.884 --> 20:13.351
This was Amy's idea?

20:13.385 --> 20:14.886
Yes, this was Amy's idea.

20:14.920 --> 20:19.324
What's your concern--
that you might have something
or that...

20:19.358 --> 20:21.392
you might share something
with her?

20:21.427 --> 20:23.695
I'm hoping
to share something with her,

20:23.729 --> 20:25.496
but not a STI or HIV.

20:25.531 --> 20:28.866
I see.
So this is preliminary?

20:28.901 --> 20:31.569
Yes.
A preliminary requirement.

20:31.604 --> 20:32.904
How preliminary?

20:32.938 --> 20:35.807
I don't know.
It's just the seco.d step

20:35.841 --> 20:37.742
in what could be
a never-ending process.

20:37.776 --> 20:39.577
Good.
Not good.

20:39.612 --> 20:43.081
You know, in order
for this test to be accurate,

20:43.115 --> 20:44.949
you should not
have had sex for--

20:44.984 --> 20:46.584
I haven't.
That was step one.

20:46.619 --> 20:48.019
No kidding?

20:48.053 --> 20:49.020
No kidding.

20:49.054 --> 20:51.022
I'm happy to hear that.

20:51.056 --> 20:53.291
In fact, I'm happy
that you're here.

20:53.325 --> 20:56.461
I think this is a very
responsible thing to do.

20:56.495 --> 20:59.130
All right.
Well, you can go now.

20:59.164 --> 21:01.032
You don't want me
to wait for you?

21:01.066 --> 21:03.334
Because we could go
and grab some dinner,

21:03.369 --> 21:06.137
just the two of us,
and then maybe you could

21:06.171 --> 21:08.139
stay over tonight
just for old time's sake.

21:08.173 --> 21:09.340
No. I'll be fine, Mom.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.808
All right.

21:10.843 --> 21:12.977
If you change
your mind, you--

21:13.012 --> 21:14.112
I won't.

21:14.146 --> 21:17.949
So, um, Amy's okay?

21:17.983 --> 21:19.517
Yes, Amy's fine.

21:19.551 --> 21:21.019
Look, you work here,

21:21.053 --> 21:23.021
so you're probably comfortable
hanging out here.

21:23.055 --> 21:25.456
I'm kind of in a hurry
to get outta here.
Do you mind?

21:25.491 --> 21:28.660
All right. You're right.

21:28.694 --> 21:31.262
You call me
when you get the results.

21:31.296 --> 21:32.764
Yeah. When will that be?

21:32.798 --> 21:34.599
Um, tomorrow.

21:34.633 --> 21:36.934
Although, it is
a little late in the day,

21:36.969 --> 21:39.671
so it could be
the day after tomorrow.

21:39.705 --> 21:41.673
Whatever. I'm really
not worried about it.

21:41.707 --> 21:43.641
I always use a condom.
Always.

21:43.676 --> 21:45.810
Ricky, you're gonna be fine.

21:45.844 --> 21:48.746
But if you're not,
most problems are treatable.

21:48.781 --> 21:50.081
What?

21:50.115 --> 21:52.650
I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know.

21:52.685 --> 21:54.318
Well, hearing about it
in health class

21:54.353 --> 21:56.020
is different
than sitting here, all right?

21:56.055 --> 21:58.623
So just go. I want
to get this over with.

21:58.657 --> 22:01.125
Call me.

22:15.874 --> 22:18.142
I don't have to
be in the room with you.

22:18.177 --> 22:21.079
I mean, I've never been
in there with you before,
and you've always been fine.

22:21.113 --> 22:23.848
I could just wait out here
with the camera and wait
for you to come out,

22:23.882 --> 22:26.751
and that way, you know,
we don't have anything on film
for posterity

22:26.785 --> 22:28.753
that people shouldn't
be looking at.

22:28.787 --> 22:32.290
You know what I mean?
I want you in there with me
for this one.

22:32.324 --> 22:34.292
This is the big one.

22:34.326 --> 22:36.294
You're not gonna get
anything on camera

22:36.328 --> 22:37.962
that we wouldn't
want to see later.

22:37.996 --> 22:41.365
It's nothing.
They're just gonna rub
some stuff all over my belly

22:41.400 --> 22:44.235
and slide this thing around,
and we can see the baby.

22:44.269 --> 22:46.237
And then we can see
and hear the heartbeat.

22:46.271 --> 22:48.639
Look, it's really cool.
You're gonna love it.

22:48.674 --> 22:52.043
And we're going to find out
if we're having a son
or daughter.

22:52.077 --> 22:54.045
I'm really excited that
you're going in with me.

22:54.079 --> 22:55.980
I don't know, Adrian.

22:56.014 --> 22:58.382
I am a little squeamish
about these things,

22:58.417 --> 23:00.184
and Dr. Attavi hates me.

23:00.219 --> 23:02.120
You'll be fine.

23:02.154 --> 23:03.955
I'll get you through this,

23:03.989 --> 23:06.924
and then you get me
through the birthing process.

23:06.959 --> 23:09.861
I do want to be there
when the baby's born.

23:09.895 --> 23:11.863
I don't want
a front-row seat--

23:11.897 --> 23:14.565
...but I do want to be there.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.603
But I've got a few months
to get ready for that.

23:20.639 --> 23:23.007
It's just
that having a baby

23:23.041 --> 23:25.777
is so...intimate.

23:25.811 --> 23:28.846
We had sex.
Sex is intimate.

23:28.881 --> 23:30.848
I had my eyes closed
most of the time.

23:30.883 --> 23:33.618
Oh, no, you didn't.

23:33.652 --> 23:35.286
All right.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.422
But that wasn't
a medical procedure.

23:38.457 --> 23:40.491
I just-- I feel like maybe
this is something

23:40.526 --> 23:43.060
that you should do with...
your mother?

23:43.095 --> 23:44.962
It's not my mother's baby.

23:46.465 --> 23:48.833
Look, just because Amy
wanted her mother there with her

23:48.867 --> 23:50.968
doesn't mean my mother
should be there with me.

23:51.003 --> 23:53.471
Her mother was there for her
because Ricky
wasn't there for her.

23:53.505 --> 23:55.540
And I really hate that you
were there for Amy

23:55.574 --> 23:57.141
but you don't
want to be here for me.

23:57.176 --> 23:59.911
I didn't go in with Amy.
I wasn't actually
there with her.

23:59.945 --> 24:01.412
I was just out
in the waiting room.

24:01.446 --> 24:04.615
That wasn't your baby, Ben.
This is your baby.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.518
I know, Adrian. I...

24:07.553 --> 24:10.988
I guess I'm just afraid
of doing the wrong thing

24:11.023 --> 24:12.990
or saying the wrong thing

24:13.025 --> 24:16.294
or being embarrassed
or embarrassing you.

24:17.329 --> 24:19.730
We already did
the wrong thing.

24:19.765 --> 24:22.800
There's really
nothing you could say
that would be wrong.

24:24.336 --> 24:26.037
Okay,

24:26.071 --> 24:29.240
if you say something wrong,
you'll know it,

24:29.274 --> 24:32.944
and you can take it back
or apologize for it.

24:32.978 --> 24:34.946
And what is there
to be embarrassed about?

24:34.980 --> 24:37.648
You've seen my stomach.
I show you my stomach
all the time.

24:37.683 --> 24:40.017
Yeah. But we're alone,
and you're otherwise dressed.

24:40.052 --> 24:43.588
I'm gonna be
otherwise dressed for this.

24:43.622 --> 24:46.624
Come on, Ben.
This is a really exciting day.

24:46.658 --> 24:49.527
I can't wait to find out,
and I can't wait
to tell our parents.

24:50.662 --> 24:52.797
You're right.

24:52.831 --> 24:54.765
It is a very exciting day.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.669
But what if it's so exciting
that I pass t?

24:58.704 --> 25:00.972
You're not going
to pass out, okay?

25:01.006 --> 25:04.008
You're gonna sit next to me
and hold my hand.

25:04.042 --> 25:06.277
Okay, you sit next to me,
and I'll hold your hand, okay?

25:06.311 --> 25:08.512
But I want you there, Ben.

25:08.547 --> 25:10.281
I really don't want you
to miss this.

25:14.987 --> 25:17.622
Adrian, Ben,
want to come on back?

25:36.377 --> 25:39.212
There's a guy here for you.
Are you available?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.948
Sorry. I was just leaving.

25:41.982 --> 25:43.516
Want to share
a bus ride home?

25:43.550 --> 25:47.320
No. My husband
is waiting for me.

25:47.354 --> 25:49.922
My husband.
I have a husband!

25:49.957 --> 25:52.392
Please. We have work.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.727
Enough about your personal life.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.567
Hi. Excuse me.
I noticed you haven't
left quite yet.

26:01.602 --> 26:04.137
May I come in?
You are in.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.240
Ah. Are you Tom Bowman?

26:07.274 --> 26:09.809
Are you the vice president
of human resources?

26:09.843 --> 26:10.810
Yes.

26:10.844 --> 26:11.811
No kidding?

26:11.845 --> 26:13.246
No kidding.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.783
All right. Well, uh,
is there anyone else

26:16.817 --> 26:19.118
in human resources
I can talk to?
No. Why?

26:19.153 --> 26:22.455
Well, the thing is, I'm, uh--
I'm having some problems.

26:22.489 --> 26:25.124
Really?
You think you got problems?

26:25.159 --> 26:27.960
Right. Well, I'm actually
having problems with Milton.

26:27.995 --> 26:30.096
Maybe you should
talk to Milton.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.765
Talk to Milton
about problems with Milton?

26:32.800 --> 26:35.234
You've seen Milton.
Okay? He's condescending.

26:35.269 --> 26:36.736
He's arrogant.
He's vindictive.

26:36.770 --> 26:40.173
He's got anger issues.
The guy is insane.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.809
And yet, you don't mind
working for him.

26:42.843 --> 26:45.278
No, no, no.
I do mind working for him.

26:45.312 --> 26:48.614
Okay? I work my butt off
for that man,
and all I get is criticism.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.116
Bad service review?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.418
Something like that. Yeah.

26:52.453 --> 26:54.821
I mean, who is he to give me
a bad service review?

26:54.855 --> 26:57.790
It's his company.
No Milton, no company.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.827
I don't know how that idiot
got to be so successful.

27:00.861 --> 27:03.830
He's got idiots like you
working for him.

27:03.864 --> 27:07.500
You know what? You're right.
You're right. I am the idiot.

27:07.534 --> 27:11.070
And I'm not going to keep
working for that guy and make
him even more successful.

27:11.105 --> 27:12.605
I mean,
why am I doing this?

27:12.639 --> 27:14.807
Why am I spending
40 hours a week
working for Milton?

27:14.842 --> 27:15.975
I don't know.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.678
Well, you know what?
Hmm? I quit.

27:18.712 --> 27:19.912
You quit?

27:19.947 --> 27:22.115
That's right. I quit.

27:22.149 --> 27:23.282
If you quit, you quit.

27:23.317 --> 27:24.951
That's right!

27:35.095 --> 27:38.498
Look at you.
You just saved us
another unemployment claim.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.032
You're a genius,
Tommy boy.

27:40.067 --> 27:43.836
I know. Excuse me.
I have to catch the bus.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.571
Okay.

27:48.342 --> 27:50.009
So I want to go out with him.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.513
He's the guy
you worked with this summer?

27:53.547 --> 27:56.315
You didn't mention
this guy all summer.

27:56.350 --> 27:59.252
You met a guy.
That's good.
I think that's good, Madison.

27:59.286 --> 28:02.155
Why didn't you tell me?
Why haven't you gone out
with him before now?

28:02.189 --> 28:05.858
Well, we couldn't go out this
summer because of company policy
for employees not to date.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.194
But I don't work there anymore,
so I'm free to go out with him.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.996
But he was not
your supervisor

28:10.030 --> 28:12.365
or anything like that,
right?

28:12.399 --> 28:14.167
No, he was.
He was what?

28:14.201 --> 28:16.235
He was my boss.
Your boss?

28:16.270 --> 28:18.905
Please, it's not like
he's an old man.

28:18.939 --> 28:21.207
He's 20, you know?
He's three years older
than me.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.408
But what happened to Jack?

28:22.442 --> 28:24.877
Well, you were right.
Jack and I needed to break up.

28:24.912 --> 28:28.014
Take a break,
not break up altogether,
not entirely.

28:28.048 --> 28:30.116
I said you could go out again
when school starts,

28:30.150 --> 28:32.518
and...school started.

28:32.553 --> 28:35.588
I know.
I think 20's
a little old.

28:35.622 --> 28:37.690
Dad, I can't help
how old he is.

28:37.724 --> 28:40.359
And it's not like
he's trying to get me to do
what Jack and I did.

28:40.394 --> 28:42.995
I don't think
he's interested in that.
No, of course not.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.798
What 20-year-old boss
trying to date their
17-year-old employee

28:45.833 --> 28:48.367
would be interested
in something like that?

28:48.402 --> 28:51.637
Madison, while
you're in high school,

28:51.672 --> 28:54.874
I want you to date someone
in high school, please.

28:54.908 --> 28:57.043
That's the thing, Dad.
He is in high school.

28:58.378 --> 29:01.380
Wellkind of.
He's at a technical high school.

29:01.415 --> 29:04.884
He went back for his diploma.
He had to drop out
because of some family problems,

29:04.918 --> 29:07.653
but he went back,
and I think that's admirable.

29:07.688 --> 29:09.622
Yes.

29:09.656 --> 29:11.123
Admirable.

29:11.158 --> 29:12.992
Family problems?

29:13.026 --> 29:15.027
Oh, yeah.
He got married before
he was out of high school.

29:15.062 --> 29:16.863
But he's divorced now,
so that's completely over.

29:16.897 --> 29:19.065
You're not joking

29:19.099 --> 29:21.500
or anything like that,

29:21.535 --> 29:22.535
are you?

29:22.569 --> 29:24.503
No. I swear.
You're gonna love him.

29:24.538 --> 29:26.706
You just have to
give him a chance.
Or not.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.875
Dad, Sammy is a nice guy.

29:28.909 --> 29:31.744
He is a really nice guy,
and he's a lot more mature
than Jack.

29:38.118 --> 29:41.754
Well? You wanted
to tell me something?

29:43.323 --> 29:45.291
Well, we just wanted
to point out

29:45.325 --> 29:47.860
that we waited,
like you asked,

29:47.895 --> 29:50.229
and we're still together

29:50.264 --> 29:52.899
after all that time.

29:52.933 --> 29:55.268
Yeah. What was it,
six weeks?

29:55.302 --> 29:57.570
Six weeks.

29:57.604 --> 29:59.906
Longer than you waited,
I imagine.

30:00.941 --> 30:02.408
Go on.

30:02.442 --> 30:04.210
Those were six
very long weeks.

30:04.244 --> 30:05.778
But who's complaining?

30:05.812 --> 30:06.913
Not me.

30:06.947 --> 30:09.916
Grace, you're not
complaining, are you?

30:09.950 --> 30:12.051
I'm not pushing her,
if that's what you're thinking.

30:12.085 --> 30:14.053
No, he's not.

30:14.087 --> 30:16.555
No, I mean,
if anything, she's...

30:16.590 --> 30:18.791
All right, you guys.

30:18.825 --> 30:21.327
I appreciate that you waited.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.330
But my reasons for wanting you
to continue to wait

30:24.364 --> 30:26.732
are the same reasons
I had before.

30:26.767 --> 30:29.302
You know the reasons, right?

30:29.336 --> 30:30.970
All right.

30:31.004 --> 30:32.905
Well, you did wait,

30:32.940 --> 30:36.042
and I would like you
to wait a while longer.

30:36.076 --> 30:38.244
Well, we don't want
to wait a while longer.

30:38.278 --> 30:40.646
Then, I guess,
if that's what you want to do,

30:40.681 --> 30:43.049
that's what you want to do.

30:43.083 --> 30:46.085
At least
you've thought about it,
and you're prepared.

30:47.354 --> 30:49.822
But--

30:53.627 --> 30:56.796
I think you both
should get tested.

30:56.830 --> 30:58.965
Since you both have had sex
with other people before.

30:58.999 --> 31:00.933
You don't need
to get tested, Mom.

31:00.968 --> 31:02.868
I mean, when I had sex,
we used a condom,

31:02.903 --> 31:05.171
and when he had sex,
he used a condom, too, right?

31:05.205 --> 31:07.773
Uh, yeah.
But maybe we've reached

31:07.808 --> 31:11.444
the part of the conversation
where it should just
be the two of us.

31:11.478 --> 31:15.114
Yeah, that's fine with me.
And Grace and I
can maybe talk later.

31:15.148 --> 31:17.650
And, Grant, I'm always available
to talk to you as well.

31:22.522 --> 31:23.823
What?

31:23.857 --> 31:25.491
Here's the thing:

31:25.525 --> 31:26.993
The girl I had sex with--

31:27.027 --> 31:28.327
Angie?
Yeah.

31:28.362 --> 31:30.830
Angie hadn't slept with
anyone else and neither had I,

31:30.864 --> 31:32.531
so we used condoms
most of the time,

31:32.566 --> 31:34.000
and the rest of the time
we were lucky.

31:34.034 --> 31:35.134
Careless.

31:35.168 --> 31:36.869
Careless and stupid.

31:36.903 --> 31:38.871
My point was,
I've only had sex with Angie.

31:38.905 --> 31:41.440
But you've had sex with Jack,
and Jack slept with Adrian,

31:41.475 --> 31:42.775
and Adrian slept with Ricky,

31:42.809 --> 31:45.478
and both Adrian and Ricky
really have slept around a lot.

31:45.512 --> 31:48.981
So now, if you and I have sex,
we're having sex with everyone
they had sex with.

31:49.016 --> 31:51.017
And even though you used
a condom with Jack,

31:51.051 --> 31:53.019
I think maybe
you should get tested,

31:53.053 --> 31:55.187
just to be safe.

31:55.222 --> 31:58.024
What do you think?
I'll tell you what I think.

31:58.058 --> 32:00.026
I think Angie's a liar.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.495
You're the first person
she ever had sex with?

32:02.529 --> 32:03.662
Yeah, right.
You don't even know her.

32:03.697 --> 32:06.165
I know her type.

32:06.199 --> 32:08.167
Well, I know Jack.
And for your information,

32:08.201 --> 32:09.869
Jack only had oral sex
with Adrian.

32:09.903 --> 32:12.872
Oh, yeah? I think
your old boyfriend's a liar.

32:12.906 --> 32:14.673
And you can get STIs
from oral sex.

32:14.708 --> 32:17.309
We only had sex one time,
and we used a condom.

32:17.344 --> 32:18.644
The entire time
you used a condom?

32:18.678 --> 32:21.080
What? I don't know.

32:21.114 --> 32:22.882
I don't remember anyway.

32:22.916 --> 32:24.550
I mean,
he took care othat.

32:24.584 --> 32:26.485
I wasn't paying attention
to that.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.988
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
Because you were
enjoying it so much.

32:32.426 --> 32:34.560
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
get tested for anything,

32:34.594 --> 32:37.496
because I don't have anything.

32:37.531 --> 32:41.133
Okay. So, we just
wait a while longer.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.301
Because?

32:42.335 --> 32:44.637
Because now I'm not
that comfortable.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.505
Jack!

32:49.910 --> 32:52.044
I want you to get tested.
I've been tested.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.849
Why?
You said you only
had oral sex with Adrian.

32:56.883 --> 32:58.684
Before me, I mean.
True.

32:58.718 --> 33:00.686
True, you said it,
or true, that's all you did?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.721
Why is my sex life
any of your business?

33:04.891 --> 33:07.026
Oh.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.695
It wouldn't hurt to get tested.
Why do you say that?

33:09.729 --> 33:12.965
I might have come into contact
with an infection at some point.

33:12.999 --> 33:15.267
Nothing that didn't respond
to medication.

33:15.302 --> 33:17.269
I'm clear.
I'm good to go now.

33:17.304 --> 33:19.238
Not that I have
any place to go.

33:19.272 --> 33:20.406
What?

33:20.440 --> 33:22.408
It happens.
It's a fact of life.

33:23.677 --> 33:25.644
And by the way,
I don't know if you've heard,

33:25.679 --> 33:27.513
but Madison broke up with me
for some guy.

33:34.688 --> 33:36.989
I'm sure she's fine.
We used a condom.

33:37.023 --> 33:38.991
And, you being
a would-be doctor,

33:39.025 --> 33:41.026
you'd be using a condom,
too, right?

33:42.729 --> 33:45.264
I'm really not gonna
talk about this with you.

34:04.017 --> 34:06.418
Hi.

34:06.453 --> 34:08.754
I texted you
a couple of times.

34:08.788 --> 34:10.556
Yeah, I know.
I couldn't text you back.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.558
Why is that?
Still busy with your survey?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.693
No, no.
I'm not doing that anymore.

34:14.728 --> 34:16.862
I did what you asked me to do.
I got tested.

34:16.897 --> 34:19.598
Oh.
That's it-- "Oh"?

34:19.632 --> 34:22.534
I would've gone with you
if I had known
you were going to do that.

34:22.569 --> 34:25.571
I didn't want you to go with me.
I didn't want anyone
to go with me.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.639
But getting tested can be scary.

34:27.674 --> 34:30.943
I mean, even if you know
everything's probably fine,
it's still very emotional.

34:30.976 --> 34:33.746
For girls maybe. I'm fine.
I'll let you know
when I hear something.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.380
Uh, will you hear
something tomorrow?

34:35.415 --> 34:36.882
Or the next day or whenever.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.551
I'll talk to you later.
I just got home.

34:38.585 --> 34:40.920
Okay. Uh, thanks, Ricky.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.289
Thank you for doing that. Bye.

34:43.322 --> 34:44.757
Bye.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.463
Oh, my God.

34:51.498 --> 34:55.501
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
What if I have something?

34:57.304 --> 34:59.271
This sucks.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.840
This totally sucks.

35:08.318 --> 35:11.086
Hey, Ashley.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.622
I was hoping you'd call.
How was school today?

35:13.656 --> 35:16.191
Well, I got that application
for home schooling.

35:16.226 --> 35:17.626
Dad said it was okay.

35:17.660 --> 35:20.028
Well, Ashley,
I don't know if it's okay.

35:20.063 --> 35:22.164
Maybe you should just
suck it up and go to school.

35:22.198 --> 35:23.899
You need
to be around people.

35:23.933 --> 35:25.334
Not those people.

35:25.368 --> 35:26.768
Well, I hated
high school, too.

35:26.803 --> 35:28.337
But you went,
so I have to go?

35:28.371 --> 35:30.138
I'n not saying
you have to go.

35:30.173 --> 35:32.708
I'm just saying
do the best thing for yourself.

35:32.742 --> 35:35.711
I really think it is
the best thing for myself and...

35:35.745 --> 35:39.114
<i>You did the best thing for you,
and I'm gonna do
the best thing for me.</i>

35:39.148 --> 35:41.216
And besides,
if I'm home schooled,

35:41.251 --> 35:43.352
I can be at your home sometimes,
if you want.

35:43.386 --> 35:45.187
Of course I want.

35:45.221 --> 35:48.457
I love it
when you come here--
you and Amy and John.

35:48.491 --> 35:51.727
But I doubt
Amy's gonna have time.

35:51.761 --> 35:54.863
I think she and Ricky
are gonna be spending
more time together.

35:54.898 --> 35:56.732
Yeah, I heard.

35:56.766 --> 36:00.168
What am I supposed to say?
She has a baby with him.

36:00.203 --> 36:04.106
And I really do think that
they care about each other,
Ashley.

36:04.140 --> 36:06.208
Of course,
I don't know if it'll last.

36:06.242 --> 36:07.876
No one knows that.

36:07.911 --> 36:09.978
And that is why
I'm never gonna get married.

36:10.013 --> 36:11.847
Maybe you will,
and maybe you won't.

36:11.881 --> 36:14.116
But your chances
of meeting someone are better
if you go to school.

36:14.150 --> 36:16.985
Actually, my chances
are probably better
if I go to a bar.

36:17.020 --> 36:18.453
Funny. No bars.

36:18.488 --> 36:20.389
All right. Well...

36:20.423 --> 36:22.291
I am gonna get my license.

36:22.325 --> 36:24.226
Well, you need driver's ed
if you do that.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.562
And you know where
you can get it for free?
High school.

36:26.596 --> 36:28.931
Mom, I'm gonna
try home school.

36:28.965 --> 36:31.133
And if it doesn't work out--

36:31.167 --> 36:34.636
You can drop out
and work at the furniture store.

36:34.671 --> 36:37.172
I'm joking.
That was actually funny.

36:37.206 --> 36:39.942
Yeah. I'm a lot funnier now
that I'm happy, Ashley.

36:39.976 --> 36:41.577
But I miss you.

36:41.611 --> 36:44.746
Yeah, I miss you, too, Mom.
Good night.

36:44.781 --> 36:47.416
Good night.

36:49.285 --> 36:52.087
Boy. I'd like a boy.

36:52.121 --> 36:54.356
Me, too.
Could be a boy.

36:54.390 --> 36:57.593
But a girl would be nice.
A boy or a girl.

36:57.627 --> 37:00.395
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be
a boy or a girl, Ruben.

37:01.331 --> 37:02.831
I know.

37:02.865 --> 37:04.833
So, are we excited yet?

37:04.867 --> 37:06.902
We're totally supportive
is what we are.

37:06.936 --> 37:09.071
Oh, come on.
Get excited.

37:09.105 --> 37:10.806
I don't want her
to have a baby.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.008
But she's having a baby,
so...

37:13.042 --> 37:16.478
So...I hope everything
goes well.

37:16.512 --> 37:19.715
Get excited.
And if you're not excited,
pretend to be excited.

37:19.749 --> 37:22.818
Maybe if you pretend
to get excited,
you'll actually be excited.

37:22.852 --> 37:25.187
Damn it, Cindy.
Get excited.
Ruben!

37:25.221 --> 37:28.390
I'm tired of being excited
about this baby all by myself.

37:28.424 --> 37:30.726
It's a baby.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.728
The baby doesn't know that
Adrian and Ben aren't married.

37:32.762 --> 37:35.564
No, the baby will
probably be school age
before he figures that out.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.265
Which is why those two
should get married.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.534
Are we actually gonna argue
about this tonight?

37:39.569 --> 37:42.237
Again tonight?

38:02.291 --> 38:03.458
Tell us.

38:13.169 --> 38:14.970
It's a girl.

38:15.004 --> 38:18.140
Oh, it's a girl,
it's a girl, it's a girl!

38:18.174 --> 38:20.308
I knew it, I knew it!

38:20.343 --> 38:21.743
Oh!
You did, Betty.

38:21.778 --> 38:23.378
You said it was
a girl all along.

38:23.413 --> 38:24.346
Right?

38:24.380 --> 38:27.349
I really wanted a girl.
And I still do.

38:27.383 --> 38:28.450
Me, too.

38:28.484 --> 38:30.118
Can't say I cared
either way.

38:30.153 --> 38:33.055
As long as the baby's healthy
and she grows up happy.

38:33.089 --> 38:36.825
How is she not
gonna grow up happy
with Ben as her daddy?

38:36.859 --> 38:39.795
Oh, Ben, you're gonna
make a great dad.
You really are.

38:39.829 --> 38:42.397
I'm gonna try.
I'm seriously gonna try,

38:42.432 --> 38:44.666
but not that I could ever be
as good as my own dad.

38:44.701 --> 38:46.635
Aw.

38:46.669 --> 38:49.905
Well, I'm gonna let
you two talk.

38:49.939 --> 38:52.340
I'm gonna go upstairs
and call Adrian.

38:52.375 --> 38:54.309
Is that all right, Ben?
Sure, Betty.

38:54.343 --> 38:57.379
I'm sure she'll love
to hear from you.
Good night.

39:01.918 --> 39:03.185
Uh, Ben?

39:05.188 --> 39:07.622
Uh, how's that ring?

39:07.657 --> 39:09.391
Is it still good?

39:09.459 --> 39:11.860
Yeah, the ring's
still very good.

39:11.894 --> 39:13.829
Oh.

39:22.071 --> 39:24.039
You would've been proud
of me today.

39:24.073 --> 39:26.441
I got through the sonogram
without passing out,

39:26.476 --> 39:30.712
and I got to see the heartbeat,
and it was amazing.

39:30.747 --> 39:33.148
It was just amazing.

39:33.182 --> 39:36.051
Just swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.

39:36.085 --> 39:41.389
This tiny little heart
in this tiny human being.

39:41.424 --> 39:44.860
This tiny girl.
It's my girl.

39:44.894 --> 39:47.095
We're having a girl.

39:47.130 --> 39:49.998
I can't wait to see her
when she's born, and...

39:50.032 --> 39:52.033
I can't even imagine it--

39:52.068 --> 39:54.369
looking at her face
for the first time.

39:54.403 --> 39:56.471
It's gonna be something.

39:58.207 --> 40:00.609
Um, did you want
to talk to me

40:00.643 --> 40:02.778
about, um, Adrian
and I getting married?

40:02.812 --> 40:05.280
Is that why Betty left?
Not necessarily.

40:05.314 --> 40:07.282
I just wondered
where you are with that--

40:07.316 --> 40:09.751
a day like today,
a night like tonight.

40:09.786 --> 40:11.787
I just wanted to hear
your thoughts on where

40:11.821 --> 40:13.722
you and Adrian
are at this point.

40:16.192 --> 40:19.761
<i>♪ You put your foot
through the door ♪</i>

40:19.796 --> 40:22.531
<i>♪ When you can't come in ♪</i>

40:22.565 --> 40:26.568
<i>♪ Empty glass, shady past ♪
</i>

40:26.602 --> 40:28.937
<i>♪ You'll find sometime ♪</i>

40:28.971 --> 40:33.508
<i>♪ Ain't it strange
how you've changed ♪
</i>

40:33.543 --> 40:37.913
<i>
Hey, let me in!
♪ You're his problem now ♪</i>

40:37.947 --> 40:41.082
Who is it?
What do you mean,
"Who is it?"

40:41.117 --> 40:44.352
<i>♪ You're my problem now ♪</i>

40:44.387 --> 40:46.655
Hi, honey. I'm home.

40:48.724 --> 40:51.893
Well. Mmm.

40:53.162 --> 40:55.730
Thank you.

40:56.799 --> 40:58.900
Thank you, Ricky.

40:58.935 --> 41:02.204
Don't worry. I'm gonna
find a place of my own.
