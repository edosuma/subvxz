WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.020
*

00:22.556 --> 00:25.559
Get out of my bed, fatso.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.996
-(grunts) Oh! Oh...
-(gagging)

00:29.029 --> 00:30.564
Oh, my God.
Oh, my, God, Mickey!

00:30.598 --> 00:31.932
Mickey, help!

00:31.965 --> 00:32.933
-(screams)
-(saw buzzing)

00:32.966 --> 00:35.669
(shrieking)

00:35.703 --> 00:38.772
-(laughs)
-Aah! What the hell's

00:38.806 --> 00:40.708
wrong with you guys?!
You could've killed me!

00:40.741 --> 00:43.711
(sighs) No, no, no. If we wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.446
What's with the Obama mask?

00:45.479 --> 00:48.116
Oh, yeah, that was just
the only mask I could find.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.583
Just a little Halloween fun.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.685
-Oh, I frickin' hate Halloween.
-What?!

00:51.719 --> 00:53.887
-Oh, what are you, a cop? It's
the best day of the year. -Oh...

00:53.921 --> 00:55.889
Yeah, it makes Christmas
look like Hanukkah.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.925
Of course you like it.
It's a holiday based entirely

00:57.958 --> 01:00.060
-on free handouts.
-I'm not sure if you're aware,

01:00.094 --> 01:02.563
but there is a war on fun
in this country.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.064
First they take our nudity,

01:04.098 --> 01:05.799
and then our profanity,
and then our violence.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.402
-Who's they?
-Them! The enemy. You know?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.271
The big dogs,
the... the fat cats.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.972
-Mm, makes me sick.
-Course it makes you sick.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.575
It makes everybody sick.
But not tonight, sir. No way.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.077
Not Halloween. This is
the one night-- the one night--

01:17.111 --> 01:18.612
where authority
means nothing, okay?

01:18.646 --> 01:19.780
Yeah, I'm gonna
transform this place

01:19.813 --> 01:21.715
into a brothel of sin.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.951
-What? -Oh, yeah.
He's really good at it, too.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.586
I think you're gonna
really like it. You should see

01:25.619 --> 01:28.055
-what he does to his apartment
every Halloween. -Yeah.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.624
-Finally, I have a playground
worthy of my talents. -Mmm.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.294
Absolutely not. People already
think this house is haunted.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.928
I refuse to participate.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.898
Um... refusal denied.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.833
Hey, I'm serious.
It's not happening!

01:39.867 --> 01:42.770
Over my dead body!

01:42.803 --> 01:44.572
Where you want this fog machine?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.906
Oh, uh, pop it over by those

01:45.939 --> 01:47.408
buckets of pigs' blood,
right there.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.477
You're really allowing this?

01:49.510 --> 01:50.944
Why wouldn't I?
This party's

01:50.978 --> 01:52.780
the perfect way
to cement my legacy.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.248
What legacy?

01:54.282 --> 01:55.916
Chip, I'm probably
the coolest person

01:55.949 --> 01:58.018
that ever went to Lockwood but,
thanks to our parents,

01:58.051 --> 02:00.288
my reputation's
taken a slight hit.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.122
I just need to make sure
that people remember me

02:02.156 --> 02:03.691
for the right reasons.
And not just now,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.959
but ten years,
20 years from now.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.428
This party's gonna be a monument

02:07.461 --> 02:10.130
to the legend
that is Sabrina Pemberton.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.200
Healthy self-image.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.268
Hey! Halloween, baby.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.438
I got 40 pounds of raw goat meat
and cow intestines,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.873
ooh, and a buttload
of chicken gizzards.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.009
-Stick 'em right there, I'll
go through 'em later. -Okay.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.612
Oh, I got to find
a Halloween costume.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.947
Oh, Jimmy and I got you covered.
You know what we do? We got

02:26.980 --> 02:28.949
this tradition where you got
to choose each other's Halloween

02:28.982 --> 02:31.018
costume, and whatever gets
chosen, you got to go with it.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.187
-You got to commit.
-Oh, okay, do me.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.322
-Yeah, you want in on that?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.389
All right.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.825
Fernando Valenzuela. Right?

02:37.858 --> 02:40.127
-Who the hell is that?
-Who the hell are you?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.896
-Wh... -He's only, like, one of
the best pitchers of all time.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
-I've never heard of him.
-People will love it, trust me.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.336
-My turn. -Randy Johnson.
-You guys making these names up?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.903
Don't do pitcher
just 'cause I did pitcher.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.905
No, I'm not.
You inspired me.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.407
You know, I mean,
you got these...

02:53.441 --> 02:55.809
long, floppy limbs
and this, like...

02:55.843 --> 02:57.545
emaciated face.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.348
Uh... No, like,
in a good way. No...

03:00.381 --> 03:02.350
(quietly): I find Randy Johnson
very attractive.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.418
All right, whatever.
Alba, do Jimmy.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.186
Okay, uh...

03:06.220 --> 03:07.655
Garbage.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.857
-SABRINA: (chuckles) Nice.
-Garbage what?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.393
Like the garbage man
to drive a truck?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.995
No. No man. No truck.
Just garbage.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.697
-Nice. Jimmy's garbage.
-Yeah. Okay.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.666
Hey, what about me?
I want to play.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.435
I don't know. You can't go
throwing one of your bitch fits

03:21.469 --> 03:23.036
if you don't get sexy ladybug.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.005
If I'm wearing it,
it's gonna be sexy.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.741
Well, we'll see about that,
Steve Jobs.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.344
-Oh. That's good.
-(Jimmy chuckles)

03:30.378 --> 03:33.381
-Also a legend.
Makes perfect sense. -Mm.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.118
I don't feel so good.
My butt keeps throwing up.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.054
Oh, no! I can't get butt sick.
Uh... not for the party.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.222
Jimmy, can you quarantine him?

03:42.256 --> 03:44.425
Oh, yeah, on it.
I'm immune.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.927
I can't remember the last time
my butt wasn't throwing up.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.529
But what about Halloween?
I want to be a ghoul

03:48.562 --> 03:50.063
and eat all the candy.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.532
Well, the candy's
not going anywhere.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.133
Once we plug up your pipes,
you can eat it

03:53.166 --> 03:54.902
till your butt starts
throwing up all over again.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.204
-Boom. -Right.
-Aw. Feel better, baby.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.239
(doorbell rings)

04:00.674 --> 04:02.410
Hey there, little guy.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.211
Kind of early to be
trick-or-treating, isn't it?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.213
Wait a second,
I remember this guy.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.316
Didn't I smash you?

04:08.349 --> 04:11.819
Oh! Yeah, that's right.
Man, I would think

04:11.852 --> 04:13.954
that tasing a resident would
be grounds for dismissal.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.423
-Suspension.
-Hmm.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.124
Which, as of tonight,
has been lifted.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.726
I'm back in the field,
where I belong.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.728
Well, everybody loves a good
comeback story.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.797
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Okay. -Not so fast.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.566
I received
an anonymous complaint

04:25.599 --> 04:27.801
about a party here, tonight.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.671
Hmm.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.440
What?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.475
-I told you: no parties.
-Mm-hmm.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.178
Thank you for your concern.
I appreciate it.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.147
But we are not having a party.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.950
All set. Eight kegs, four taps,
200 pounds of ice.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.319
Sign here, please.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.356
(pen scratching on paper)

04:48.389 --> 04:49.990
I enjoy drinking.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.326
I like the escape.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.962
I'm warning you.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.797
-Look, even if we were having
a party-- -Which we are not.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.699
which we are not--
there would be nothing

04:58.732 --> 05:00.468
you could do about it, because
you're weak and insignificant.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.870
And you certainly
wouldn't be invited,

05:02.903 --> 05:05.172
-'cause you would ruin the vibe.
-(scoffs)

05:05.205 --> 05:06.674
See, that's where you're wrong.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.175
It's Halloween tonight.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.977
-The police are stretched thin.
-Mm-hmm?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.846
So within the walls of this
gated community, I am the law.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.783
-Mmm. -And if I hear
so much as one noise complaint,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.785
-Uh-huh.
-by God, I will rain down...

05:17.818 --> 05:19.987
Oh, Chip.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.390
Now, why'd you go
and do something like that?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.558
Very bad idea,
this thing you did.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.860
I warned you guys.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.396
We're not throwing a party.
It's a stupid holiday

05:28.429 --> 05:30.564
for stupid people.
I won't be a part of it.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.500
Why are you walking towards me?
Stop.

05:32.533 --> 05:36.036
Stop! Stand down!
I command you.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.305
Don't make me do something
I'll regret.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.742
Are you insane? Let me out!
This is ridiculous.

05:41.775 --> 05:45.012
Told you you'd be participating.
Happy Halloween.

05:45.045 --> 05:48.048
-(chuckles)
-Release me! Release me now!

05:50.418 --> 05:52.420
*

05:58.091 --> 05:59.560
-CHIP: You gotta let me out,
man. -(cage rattling)

05:59.593 --> 06:01.862
Help me!
Come on, let me out.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.363
Let me out now!

06:03.397 --> 06:05.533
-(cage rattling)
-I don't get his costume,

06:05.566 --> 06:08.702
but cage boy
is really committed.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.270
Just let me out of the cage now!

06:10.303 --> 06:11.605
(shrieks): Come o...

06:11.639 --> 06:14.007
I don't get it.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.009
Randy Jackson
from American Idol?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.878
Randy Johnson.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.448
The Big Unit?
Seattle Mariners?

06:20.481 --> 06:22.382
Dude, I'm just trying
to get a drink.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.951
All right, well, sit tight, guy.
My homegirl's filling up

06:23.984 --> 06:25.919
-her pumpkin.
-Yeah.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.188
All right. (laughs)

06:28.221 --> 06:29.790
-You good?
-Yeah!

06:29.823 --> 06:32.392
-Wow, this party is awesome.
-Oh, yeah.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.863
(laughs) Oh, did you know
that when you flush the toilets,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.264
they fill back up with blood?

06:37.297 --> 06:40.200
(chuckles)
Classic bloody bowl. Yeah.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.102
Hot garbage, coming through.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.204
-Oh. -Ooh!
-Yeah. I went method.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.740
-Yeah. -I've already gone to the
bathroom twice in this thing.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.643
Okay. Normally
that would gross me out,

06:49.677 --> 06:52.813
-but I'm very excited
by this commitment. -Oh, yeah?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.782
-Yeah. -Well, why don't you
get excited about this?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.416
ALBA:
What is that?

06:56.450 --> 06:58.285
-JIMMY: That is Ben.
-ALBA: Ugh.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.421
-Rigged up a baby monitor.
-He looks awful.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.090
Well, I slapped some
ghoulish makeup on him

07:03.123 --> 07:05.826
-once he passed out. -How is he
sleeping through this?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.961
Put, uh, some cold medication
in some candy--

07:07.995 --> 07:09.396
sucked it right down.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.432
Oh. Nice. Good thinking.
What else you got?

07:12.466 --> 07:16.169
Uh, let's see.
I got a lot. Oh.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.772
See that nerd over there
by what he thinks is a speaker?

07:18.806 --> 07:21.174
-Mm-hmm. -Yeah.
-It's not. It's a blood cannon.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.910
-(both giggling)
-Watch this. -Okay.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.479
-See ya, nerd.
-ALBA: What's he doing?

07:25.513 --> 07:27.748
-What? Okay, what's he doing?
-Damn it.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.583
I got a glitch.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.184
Excuse me, gentlemen.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.853
-I got to go fix it.
-Aah!

07:32.886 --> 07:35.589
-Oh.
-(laughs)

07:35.623 --> 07:37.758
I don't remember
Jobs doing shorts.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.459
Think different.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.361
Don't know what that means.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.163
So what do you think?

07:43.196 --> 07:46.834
Is this a party worthy of
the legendary Sabrina Pemberton?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.836
Yeah, but this is just
the opening act.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.370
The main event's
right over there.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.774
Damn, Peter's not a boy anymore.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.175
-Mm.
-Actually, he is.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.476
He's a freshman.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.045
You're gonna nail a freshman?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.780
Not just a freshman.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.650
The freshman-- Matty Pruitt.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.052
After I sink my teeth into him,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.454
he'll be talking about me
for the next four years,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.322
and that is how
you cement a legacy.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.891
Your mind is
a frightening place.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.325
(laughing):
Oh.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.494
It looks like
someone's moving in.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.896
-(Alba and Mickey laugh)
-All right.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.865
That's not part of the plan.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.833
-I like this. That pleases me.
-(laughing): Yes.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.835
Damn it! There's supposed
to be a skeleton

08:21.869 --> 08:24.572
tearing through here
on a zip line, a real one.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.240
Where'd you get a real skeleton?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.476
Oh, a vet clinic
down in Hartford.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.312
It's actually a raccoon, but
it looks just like a little kid.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.649
Jimmy, just let me out
of the cage.

08:35.683 --> 08:39.386
Oh, but Mick would eat me alive
if I did that.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.722
But I'll tell you what I can do.

08:41.755 --> 08:42.823
I can give you this.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.558
What is that?

08:44.592 --> 08:45.693
Well, people will
respect you more

08:45.726 --> 08:48.495
if they think you chose
to be in the cage.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.264
I am not wearing
a monkey costume.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.366
Hmm. Suit yourself.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.502
I got to go fix
a broken breaker board.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.838
This is a disaster.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.406
ALBA:
Come on, bring it!

08:59.439 --> 09:01.241
-(indistinct shouting)
-MICKEY: And the pitch.

09:01.274 --> 09:05.012
-Oh! Not my boob! Aah!
-(people clamoring, groaning)

09:05.045 --> 09:06.947
Lighten up. You're fine.
Put it back up on the head.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.415
Hold still this time.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.550
SECURITY GUARD:
Okay, party's over, everyone!

09:10.584 --> 09:12.886
-Oh, no, no, no. -Every single
one of you, get out!

09:12.920 --> 09:15.188
-Yeah, you heard me.
Let's go! -MICKEY: No, no. No.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.757
Nobody go anywhere, all right?

09:16.790 --> 09:19.559
This man is not to be respected.
He has no authority.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.428
Yes, I am, and I do.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.030
Come on, let's empty these cups!

09:23.063 --> 09:24.865
-Okay.
-(gasps) -(woman laughing)

09:24.898 --> 09:27.200
(gasps, pants)
That is not what I meant.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
-No?
-And you know it!

09:29.102 --> 09:30.470
-Oh.
-Don't push me!

09:30.503 --> 09:32.272
Like that?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.207
I don't like piglets like you.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.143
You know, coming around,
snorting around,

09:36.176 --> 09:37.745
ruining everybody's fun.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.980
And on this...
this holiest of nights?

09:40.013 --> 09:41.949
(in deep voice):
How dare you!

09:41.982 --> 09:44.451
That's it!
I'm taking you in. Hey!

09:44.484 --> 09:46.319
-Give that back to me!
-Come get it, pig.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.421
Give it back. Give...
Hey, hey, hey! Give it!

09:48.455 --> 09:51.458
Give it back. Give...
Hey, someone help me.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.726
-Oh, yeah.
-Come on. I'm an offic...

09:52.760 --> 09:54.127
-Boo, bitch!
-(people gasping)

09:54.161 --> 09:56.930
-Alba!
-Oh, mischief, baby! (laughs)

09:56.964 --> 10:00.567
If that were a real person, that
would be very inappropriate.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.336
-Oh, come on.
-Well, now we got to...

10:03.370 --> 10:05.172
-(grunts)
-We got to move him now?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.641
All right, let's go. Man down.
Everybody out of the way.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.277
-What the hell are you doing?
-Shut up, monkey.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.679
-(groaning)
-Hey, back!

10:11.712 --> 10:13.146
(groans, bars rattle)

10:13.180 --> 10:15.115
Come on. Come on, load him up.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.918
-Okay. There we go, yeah.
-There we go.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.486
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.321
-(panting)
-(whoop)

10:21.354 --> 10:22.856
-And that, my friend...
-Ooh! (laughs)

10:22.890 --> 10:25.358
-...is how you clean up a mess.
-(laughing): Yeah.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.094
-(laughing): Yeah.
-WOMAN (over radio): Unit 37,

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
we've got a receptacle
fire over on Maple.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.764
Need you to extinguish. Copy?

10:30.798 --> 10:34.034
37? You mean there's 36 more
of these losers?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.870
WOMAN (over radio):
Unit 37, please respond. Copy?

10:36.904 --> 10:38.305
Well, if we don't respond,

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
they're gonna send someone
to look for him.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.342
That's not good.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.512
(in deep voice):
Uh, 10-4, Eleanor.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.614
This is unit 37 on it.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.983
Uh, copy-copy.
Roger-dodger. Over.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.153
*

10:53.186 --> 10:54.654
Hey, having fun?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.056
Sabrina, hey!

10:56.089 --> 10:57.858
-Awesome party.
-Mm-hmm.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.326
Do people actually live here?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.061
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.363
What a funny question.
You're so funny.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.700
Oh, my God.
And this costume! So funny.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.535
-Oh, thanks.
-It's, like, Tinker Bell

11:08.568 --> 11:10.237
is such a crazy little psycho,
you know?

11:10.270 --> 11:13.006
-It's perfect for you.
-How is Tinker Bell a psycho?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.808
(laughing):
How is she not a psycho, right?

11:14.842 --> 11:18.045
She's so obsessed with Peter
that she tries to kill herself.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.980
-I don't think
she tries to kill herself. -Mm.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.915
Yeah, she definitely does.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.751
She realizes
that he's more into Wendy,

11:23.784 --> 11:26.253
and then, you know,
she pounds a bunch of poison.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.555
Honestly, what did she think was
gonna happen, right? I mean,

11:28.588 --> 11:30.423
he's a boy, and you're a bug.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.826
It's like, "Get out of here,
bug. Stop bugging everyone."

11:32.860 --> 11:34.494
(laughs)

11:34.527 --> 11:36.329
Do you want me to leave
or something?

11:36.363 --> 11:40.167
Are you crazy? I want you
to stay and have fun, unless

11:40.200 --> 11:42.435
you feel like you want to leave,
in which case,

11:42.469 --> 11:43.837
-you should totally go.
-JIMMY: Pick up your foot,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.572
-or you're gonna get
electrocuted. -Hey, watch it.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.340
Jimmy, do you mind? I'm in
the middle of a conversation.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.776
JIMMY:
Oh, I'm sorry,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.710
you're in the middle
of a conversation,

11:50.744 --> 11:52.379
because I got
a busted compression system

11:52.412 --> 11:53.914
on my number four blood cannon.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.349
That's okay.
I'm gonna go find Matty.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.951
Uh...

11:59.219 --> 12:01.521
See what you did!

12:01.554 --> 12:04.224
Idiot!

12:04.257 --> 12:06.426
* And it lurks inside
of us all *

12:06.459 --> 12:08.195
Ridiculous.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.097
-(electrical pop, buzzing)
-Aah!

12:10.130 --> 12:13.133
* And it's hard to be
the one you want me to... *

12:13.166 --> 12:14.768
(gasps)

12:17.170 --> 12:18.806
Candy.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.915
(siren wailing,
tires squealing)

12:27.948 --> 12:29.249
(both laughing)

12:30.350 --> 12:32.319
(siren stops)

12:32.352 --> 12:34.421
Whoa! Okay.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.457
-For a security car, this lady's
got some balls. -Yeah.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.959
I'm gonna go stomp that out.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.493
-Then we'll get back to the fun.
-Yeah, okay.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.402
-(gasps, shrieks)
BOY: Yeah, man, get him.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.737
Nice.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.306
-(shrieking, groaning)
-Yeah, keep throwing.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.008
Stop! (coughs)
Stop it!

12:55.042 --> 12:56.576
(Mickey shrieks)
Oh!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.511
You better run,
you little bastards!

12:58.545 --> 13:00.613
I will murder you!

13:00.647 --> 13:03.750
I will burn your houses while
your families sleep in them!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.353
I will drink your blood!

13:09.222 --> 13:12.025
Buckle up, Alba!

13:12.059 --> 13:13.827
(tires screech)

13:21.568 --> 13:23.336
You know,
just to play devil's advocate,

13:23.370 --> 13:24.972
they were only having fun.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.506
How about you stop
worrying about the devil

13:26.539 --> 13:27.875
and advocate for my face?!

13:27.908 --> 13:29.609
Okay. There's just
so many costumes.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.511
How are we going to see them?

13:31.544 --> 13:34.481
We just need to see someone
who doesn't want to see us.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.686
Got him.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.398
(tires screech)

13:51.431 --> 13:52.832
(panting)

13:52.866 --> 13:54.534
What's up now, piggy?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.303
Out of your jurisdiction?
(laughs)

13:56.336 --> 13:58.838
(engine revving)

13:58.872 --> 14:00.908
(tires screech)

14:03.576 --> 14:05.245
(panting)

14:05.278 --> 14:07.014
Who the hell are you?

14:07.047 --> 14:09.682
I'm Randy Johnson.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.252
Who?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.221
You've been going about this
all wrong.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.923
Matty's only here
with Tinker Bell

14:15.956 --> 14:17.557
because he thinks
that you're unattainable,

14:17.590 --> 14:19.927
which makes sense.
You are.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.195
Sabrina, come on. This guy's
awake, and it's getting weird.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.663
I agree.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.098
You just need to prove to him

14:25.132 --> 14:26.766
that you're open
to being attained.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.936
(chuckles)
That's good.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.770
Can I at least get a drink?

14:30.803 --> 14:33.273
*

14:33.306 --> 14:34.908
(grunts)

14:37.945 --> 14:39.079
Hey, Peter.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.780
-Hey.
-Find your shadow yet?

14:40.813 --> 14:43.183
I... uh, no, n-not yet.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.386
It's actually, it's kind of hard
with all the lights in here.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.720
-(laughs): Right.
-You know. Yeah.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.223
Uh, I'm pretty sure
I saw it in my bedroom.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.126
-Come on. I'll show you.
-Ah, oh, man...

14:53.160 --> 14:55.262
Oh. Is Matty Pruitt shy?

14:55.295 --> 14:59.032
No. No, it-it's not...
it's not that. Um...

14:59.066 --> 15:01.701
Sabrina, you're...
you're really great.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.604
I just, uh,
I came here with Gretchen.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.240
Uh, Tinker Bell.
You know...

15:07.274 --> 15:09.742
I just, I-I don't want
to disrespect her like that.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.145
(laughs): Oh, whoa, Matty,
slow down, okay?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.414
I'm not trying to hit on you.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.416
You're not? You're...

15:16.449 --> 15:18.151
You're a freshman, you know?
You're just...

15:18.185 --> 15:20.053
you're just a little guy.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.621
-You know?
-Okay.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.156
Oh, don't be embarrassed--
it's just...

15:23.190 --> 15:25.959
you're not... there yet.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.829
Plus, I have a boyfriend.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.898
He lives in the city,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.133
and, um...

15:33.166 --> 15:34.834
he's European.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.238
So it's, like... a whole thing.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.141
I should...
I should probably call him.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.143
It's been... like, a wh...

15:43.176 --> 15:44.377
Bye.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.981
*

15:59.392 --> 16:01.961
All right, so we got,
like, 20 eggs left, so...

16:01.995 --> 16:03.863
what if we soaked them
in lighter fluid

16:03.896 --> 16:06.666
and lit them on fire
so we could throw fire eggs...

16:09.702 --> 16:11.538
Well, well, well.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.006
(grunts)

16:13.040 --> 16:14.707
Who the hell are you guys?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.343
I'm Hernando Lalazoola.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.146
It's Fernando Valenz...
Just forget about it.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.148
-What the hell, Sean?
-What do you want from me?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.215
-These dudes are nuts.
-Okay, fellas,

16:22.249 --> 16:23.683
here's what I'm thinking.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.985
I take you back home
to your parents,

16:26.019 --> 16:28.488
charge you with assault,
probably just toss you in juvie,

16:28.521 --> 16:31.458
-maybe throw you
in the big boy tank. -Oh, no.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.061
Or...

16:34.094 --> 16:36.963
you guys eat every single one
of these eggs and walk away.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.831
Sounds like a good deal.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.034
(chuckles):
Uh, but that's impossible.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.236
Graduating from high school
is impossible!

16:43.270 --> 16:44.904
Eating eggs...

16:44.937 --> 16:46.906
is entirely possible.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.308
Sir, I'm-I'm really sorry...

16:48.341 --> 16:50.710
Open... your mouth.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.481
(faint grunt)

16:54.514 --> 16:55.915
Now bite.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.886
Because I think I'd remember
if I signed for it.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.255
Did you check his I.D.?

17:02.289 --> 17:05.592
Oh, you just hand over
a 50-gallon drum of slime

17:05.625 --> 17:07.360
to any Tom, Dick or Harry
with a pencil?!

17:07.394 --> 17:09.062
Hang on a second.
Sabrina, did you sign

17:09.096 --> 17:11.164
for my slime, or know who did?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.200
-What?!
-Yeah, she doesn't know.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.401
So let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.870
No. Because...
Sabrina, that's tech support!

17:17.904 --> 17:19.606
I've got bigger problems, okay?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.408
Matty Pruitt just rejected me!

17:21.441 --> 17:23.243
And it's fine,
'cause I played it off

17:23.276 --> 17:25.078
and told him I had
a Euro boyfriend.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.879
But seriously, who the hell
does he think he is?

17:26.913 --> 17:29.048
I mean, I'm way hotter
than that Tinker Bell slut.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.418
Oh. He's with Tinker Bell.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.685
Let me tell you something.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.387
I'm the hottest girl
in school, okay?

17:34.421 --> 17:37.224
I could screw all those girls'
boyfriends if I wanted to.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.592
And when they go home
and they cry to their daddies,

17:39.626 --> 17:42.895
I could kick the door down
and screw their daddies, too!

17:43.930 --> 17:46.233
Okay, even if that is true,

17:46.266 --> 17:48.468
I recommend we not do that.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.470
*

17:50.503 --> 17:54.941
I can do whatever
the hell I want, you fool.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.976
(whispers):
I'm unstoppable.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.816
JIMMY (on monitor):
Yah. Yah. I know it. I know.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.985
Yah, because I did it myself.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.654
Do not put me on hold!

18:07.687 --> 18:09.322
(Jimmy groans in frustration)

18:09.356 --> 18:12.058
(pants)
You guys, I was kidding.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.326
-Honestly, I was kidding.
-BOY: Oh, great.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.963
Oh, my God, it's Halloween--
lighten up.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.499
Let's party, right?

18:19.532 --> 18:20.800
Let's...

18:25.505 --> 18:27.106
All right, so what?

18:27.140 --> 18:29.176
Okay? It's not like
what I said wasn't true.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.111
I am the hottest girl in school,
and you all know that.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.148
It's genetics-- what are you
gonna do, be mad at my genes?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.451
-(scattered laughter)
-Seriously?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.853
Who did that? Huh?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.655
Come on, man up--
who did that?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.225
Oh, you don't know?
Who did it?!

18:47.360 --> 18:49.862
Come on, we were just trying
to have some fun.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.164
That wasn't fun, okay?

18:51.198 --> 18:53.700
I know fun, all right?
I invented fun.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.468
Come on, it's Halloween.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.836
I also invented Halloween.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.038
But you said if we ate the eggs,
you'd let us go.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.773
-Well, you did say that.
-I know what I said.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.142
I lied. It was a trick. That's
what Halloween's all about.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.644
Right? Tricks and treats.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.946
Not assaulting people
with unborn chickens.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.782
Now, you sit here and reflect
on your poor choices, while me

19:09.816 --> 19:12.385
and should-be Hall of Famer
Fernando Valenzuela

19:12.419 --> 19:15.555
go tear the ass off this place.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.156
(laughs): Oh, yeah,
you think that's funny?

19:17.190 --> 19:19.326
I'll tell you what's funny--
how irrelevant

19:19.359 --> 19:20.993
you all are!

19:21.027 --> 19:22.495
You're just a bunch of maggots

19:22.529 --> 19:25.232
I've been carrying
on my back for years!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.733
But not anymore.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.501
No, no, no, no, no.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.870
Soon I'll be gone,
and you'll all be adrift

19:30.903 --> 19:33.973
in a sea of mediocrity

19:34.006 --> 19:36.509
just dreaming of sunnier days
when I was your queen

19:36.543 --> 19:39.546
and you were just jesters
in my court!

19:39.579 --> 19:42.415
-And you'll remember this day,
because your lives -Come on.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.183
will never be the same--
but me,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.519
me, I'm never gonna think
about it again.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.855
I made you
and I can destroy you,

19:48.888 --> 19:53.360
and you will never forget me!
You will remember me!

19:53.393 --> 19:55.295
Aah...!

19:56.963 --> 20:01.167
-(explosion)
-(shouts)

20:01.200 --> 20:02.769
(high-pitched tone drones)

20:02.802 --> 20:05.572
(muted, distorted voices)

20:05.605 --> 20:08.341
JIMMY (muted):
Oh, man! oh, my God!

20:08.375 --> 20:12.078
-(voice muted)
-(high-pitched tone continues)

20:12.111 --> 20:13.713
(muted)

20:13.746 --> 20:15.114
(high-pitched tone drones)

20:15.147 --> 20:16.516
(muted)

20:16.549 --> 20:18.951
(high-pitched tone drones)

20:27.126 --> 20:29.296
Dude. She's a witch.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.469
No, don't eat that, Benito.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.705
But Mickey said
I could have as much as I want.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.107
Yeah, I know, but this
is covered in pig's blood. No.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.710
Oh, well, well.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.412
Don't talk to me.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.813
(mock crying):
"Don't talk to me."

20:46.846 --> 20:48.114
Hey, lady! You're crazy.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.582
You could've killed someone!

20:49.616 --> 20:50.983
Hey, pipe down, security man.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.119
The way I see it
you got two options.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.387
You can either be the zero

20:54.421 --> 20:56.389
who was locked in a cage
all night naked

20:56.423 --> 20:59.826
with a 13-year-old boy,
or you could be the hero

20:59.859 --> 21:01.661
who rounded up and captured
a bunch of vandals

21:01.694 --> 21:03.262
who were terrorizing
the neighborhood.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.432
They are sitting
in your car out front.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.199
Fine. Give me the keys.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.102
Can I have my clothes back?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.571
No.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.306
(groans):
Oh...

21:15.642 --> 21:19.312
(chuckles) Oh, Mick,
I wish you could've seen it.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.147
I don't think anyone's
ever gonna forget this night

21:21.180 --> 21:23.916
-as long as they live.
-Oh, God. -Yeah. No kidding.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.418
Why did you do it without me?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.786
Well, next time's gonna be nuts.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.155
I know a guy who works
at a morgue down in Providence.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.791
Now, he said if nobody claims
a John Doe after 30 days,

21:31.824 --> 21:33.493
they just toss it
in the furnace.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.295
He said he could easily
set one aside for me.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.964
-Oh! That's awesome!
-Oh-ho-ho-ho!

21:37.997 --> 21:42.034
Oh, no, no, no, come on,
can't we just be done with this?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.436
-(shrieks)
-Aah!

21:43.470 --> 21:45.271
(laughter)

21:45.304 --> 21:46.973
I frickin' hate Halloween!

21:47.006 --> 21:48.875
(laughter continues)

21:48.908 --> 21:51.077
-Jimmy!
-That was really good.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.014
MICKEY:
I will drink your blood!

enjoyed
kickin' it

Now here are a few more shows
