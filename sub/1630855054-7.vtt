- Why are--
- So, okay, there's a, um, thing

08:16.914 --> 08:19.833
which is that the Hayes' workshop
sold out in, like, two seconds.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.502
So, um, there's a loophole,

08:21.502 --> 08:23.420
which is that we take
the Abandonment workshop,

08:23.420 --> 08:25.255

one piece of art a year.

CLARE:
Mm. No, not-- not like this.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.831

is practically handmade by her.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.500

to law school with you next year?

09:21.270 --> 09:23.063
Would you die? [laughs]

09:26.984 --> 09:28.235
Well, actually, I was, uh...

09:28.944 --> 09:30.654
I was thinking--
Well, we were thinking...

09:31.572 --> 09:34.408
that I might, uh, defer a year

09:34.408 --> 09:35.701
to do some traveling abroad.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.662
I'm sorry?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.956
Clare's applying
to a semester in Dublin,

09:40.956 --> 09:42.249
so we-- we thought it might be fun

09:42.249 --> 09:45.127
if we both stayed on
a bit longer, right? Yeah.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.753
Huh.

09:47.713 --> 09:48.714
I'm just gonna use the,

09:49.256 --> 09:52.092
uh, bathroom.
JESS: Oh, the bathroom?
It's-- Just go out to the left.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.927
Welcome, writers.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.473
Take a look at this chair.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.392

10:00.392 --> 10:01.768

10:01.768 --> 10:03.228
WOMAN:
How does it make you feel?

10:05.981 --> 10:09.318
What memories does it call up in you?

10:10.694 --> 10:12.321
In this writing workshop,

10:12.321 --> 10:14.323
we'll explore abandonment

10:14.323 --> 10:17.743
as it relates to ourselves
and our characters.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.203
And we'll do it safely,

10:20.204 --> 10:21.371
in a circle of trust.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.290
[softly] We're just gonna stay
for one minute,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.917
and then we can bail and go to Hayes.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.335
- Okay? Yeah.
- [softly] We can't do this.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.670
Oh, but also,
he's with Random House too.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.048
So I wanna ask him about an editor.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.425
Ladies, everyone...

10:33.425 --> 10:34.468
Sorry.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.512
WOMAN:
Maybe we weren't held...

10:36.512 --> 10:38.222
[softly]
We can't just leave after a minute.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.057
We have to stay a little bit longer
or it would be rude.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.978
...maybe you weren't invited
to that birthday party because...

10:45.979 --> 10:49.358
everybody knew that you always wore
a T-shirt over your bathing suit.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.528
- Fuck it. Let's go now.
- No, we can't--

10:52.528 --> 10:55.113
- Let's go. Come on. Let's go.
- Stop. You're not gonna leave me--

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
Come on. I'm not staying. Come on.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.617
Amy!

11:01.203 --> 11:02.371
[door opens]

11:02.371 --> 11:03.705
I'm sorry.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.706
[door closes]

11:05.541 --> 11:08.627
Let's begin by closing our eyes

11:08.627 --> 11:13.841
and remembering a time
we emotionally abandoned ourselves.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.433
JESS: [chuckling]
I should've known.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.104
[softly] I love this room.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.940
All these... books!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.066
Oh, you should take that one.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.611
Hayes MacKeown.
Oh, my mom reads everything he writes.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.991
CLARE: And this ladder.
I've only seen them in the movies.

11:38.991 --> 11:42.703
I didn't know normal people
had bookcases with ladders!

11:42.703 --> 11:44.121
JESS:
You think my parents are normal?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.122
Yes.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.958
They think you're just with some...

11:49.376 --> 11:51.336
- backwoods...
- What?

11:51.336 --> 11:53.338
- Why did I wear this dress?
- Stop.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.339
You're perfect.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.177
When...

11:58.594 --> 11:59.845
do you think we should tell them?

12:00.429 --> 12:01.430
Tell them what?

12:01.430 --> 12:02.806
JESS:
That we're engaged.

12:05.934 --> 12:06.935
What?

12:09.688 --> 12:10.689
We should get married.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.274
No.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.818
Well, we've only been together, like--

12:15.903 --> 12:17.696
We've only been together,
like, three months.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.697
JESS:
I-- I don't care.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.576
I don't. I want us to...

12:24.661 --> 12:27.247
I want us to spend our lives together.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.583
And then one day, we'll...

12:31.502 --> 12:32.503
We'll have our own house,

12:32.503 --> 12:34.129
and-- and it'll be full of...

12:35.339 --> 12:38.383
- art and so many books...
- Books.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.427
...and as many ladders
as you want.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.557
Are you being serious?

12:48.310 --> 12:49.728
Uh...

12:49.728 --> 12:50.938
- If you say yes, yeah.
- Yeah, right.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.151
[indistinct chatter]

12:58.904 --> 13:01.532
MAN: You kinda-- You wanna unlive that.
You know what I mean?

13:02.199 --> 13:04.576
However, it does beg the question,

13:04.576 --> 13:07.955
this is-- this is probably
gonna be a plotline for the next one,

13:07.955 --> 13:10.207
if I ever do a next one
'cause why the fuck would I bother?

13:10.207 --> 13:11.959
But that being said...

13:12.876 --> 13:13.877
Excuse me?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.716
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry,
but I'm just gonna sneak in there.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.635
No. You-- You can't. It's full.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.597
No one's gonna know if I go in there.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.892
I tried my workshop, but it's just--
It's not a great fit for me.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.436
So I'm-- I think
I could just slip into that.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.146
I can't let you join that one,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.482
but I-- I can get you into, uh,

13:35.482 --> 13:38.527
"Kooks, Crazies, and Nut Jobs:
Writing About Mental Illness"

13:38.527 --> 13:40.028
with Jan Barnes-Jablonski.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.573
I don't think
any of those words are okay to say.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.449
It's literally the name of the workshop.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.325
AMY:
Clare. Clare.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.493
CLARE:
Oh.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.166
AMY: Uh-huh, okay.
Can you hold on one second?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.168
Amy! [scoffs]

13:54.168 --> 13:55.961
Oh, my God,
I'm dealing with this book stuff.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.963
My agent wants
this book to come out in--

13:57.963 --> 13:59.631
Why did you just leave me?

14:01.175 --> 14:03.051
- Are you being serious right now?
- Yeah!

14:03.051 --> 14:06.722
I didn't leave you, Clare. You <i>stayed.</i>

14:08.015 --> 14:09.016
CLARE:
Ugh.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.643
Hi. Yeah, I'm here.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.522
I-- I don't know,
I've never been to London before.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.068
Wow.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.654
This-- This is incredible.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.490
Yeah, well, don't expect a home library.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.409
Hi!

14:27.409 --> 14:29.036
Hi, Mom.
JESS: Hi!

14:29.036 --> 14:30.537
- We meet again!
- Whoa!

14:30.537 --> 14:32.998
CLARE: Jess didn't believe me
when I said, "Middle of nowhere."

14:33.498 --> 14:34.833
- Hi, honey.
- I missed you.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.210
How was the drive?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.213
I hope no one rear-ended you.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.923
[laughing] No. No.

14:40.923 --> 14:41.924
FRANKIE:
This time.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.429
Is this--

14:48.514 --> 14:49.890
Is this, um...

14:49.890 --> 14:51.141
Yeah.

14:51.642 --> 14:54.895
Yeah. Yeah, we-- we wanted it
to be a-- a surprise.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.855
It's Jess' grandma's engagement ring.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.149
I am surprised.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.779
DANNY: [on voice mail]
<i>Hey, it's Danny. You know what to do.</i>

15:03.779 --> 15:05.405
Hey, it's me. I'm just checking in

15:05.405 --> 15:07.991
because I-- I just hate
how we left things, and I just--

15:08.575 --> 15:10.327
This place is so awful.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.790
People are so weird,
and-- and everyone is vegan,

15:14.790 --> 15:15.999
and there's, like, no bar,

15:15.999 --> 15:18.293
and I just-- I'm, like-- Just wanna--

15:22.756 --> 15:26.009
Uh, anyway,
so I'll just see you tomorrow night.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.387
And, um, uh-- Okay. All right. Bye.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.779
Ooh, my God!

15:47.239 --> 15:49.366
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's hotter than I--

15:49.366 --> 15:50.450
Ooh!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.827
- HAYES: You'll get used to it.
- Yeah.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.207
I'm Clare.

15:58.417 --> 15:59.960
P-- Pierce.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.961
Oh, yeah?

16:01.712 --> 16:03.547
CLARE:
You probably don't remember my name.

16:05.757 --> 16:09.845
Oh, look, if I-- If I did
anything, uh, inappropriate,

16:09.845 --> 16:11.471
it was entirely my fault.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.932
I was a whiskey sodden wanker

16:13.932 --> 16:15.350
- with the manners of a fuckin'--
- Oh, my God. No!

16:15.350 --> 16:17.227
- No?
- Yeah. No.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.770
All right, that's a fucking relief.

16:18.770 --> 16:23.150
Actually,
I sent you a letter, uh, once

16:23.150 --> 16:25.652
- with a short story...
- Oh, yeah?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.653
...that I'd written.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.740
It's called
"The House with the Blue Canoe."

16:30.240 --> 16:32.201
Right.
CLARE: It was a long time ago.

16:32.201 --> 16:34.286
It was, like,
18 years ago that I wrote it.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.038
It was on the back of a menu.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.373
I was a waitress.
Had a lot of doodles on it.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.374
Nice.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.336
The menu had a lot of stuff on it,
like, "Surf, Surf, and Surf."

16:42.336 --> 16:43.337
HAYES:
[chuckling] Okay.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.839
He was a very irreverent chef.
HAYES: Right.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.510
Um, anyway, the-- the point is,
is that I wrote to you about my story

16:49.510 --> 16:50.928
and then you answered me back.

16:52.429 --> 16:53.430
What did I say?

16:54.014 --> 16:58.435
"Dear Clare, thank you so much
for sharing your beautiful short story.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.395
"I was deep in the throes of writing,

17:00.395 --> 17:03.774
"but I just had to stop to tell you
to keep up the good work and keep going.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.194
There's something special there.
Much love, H.M."

17:07.194 --> 17:08.987
[exhales] Or something like that.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.864
Yeah. That's nice.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.699
Anyway...

17:15.494 --> 17:20.499
You told me to--
You... told me to keep going.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.376
- HAYES: Good.
- So I did.

17:22.376 --> 17:23.836
- Okay, good!
- Yeah.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.963
Then... I didn't.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.173
I didn't. I--

17:29.842 --> 17:31.635
Oh, I thought
that if I just, like, saw you,

17:31.635 --> 17:34.137
like... saw you, saw you--

17:34.137 --> 17:37.766
Like, it-- it would
just jar something loose in me

17:37.766 --> 17:41.979
or just, like, dislodge something
that's, like, kept me from--

17:43.647 --> 17:46.316
[sighs] Do you remember
what you saw in me?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.279
I didn't read your story.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.700
And I-- I didn't write to you,
for that matter.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.701
You did.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.661
I have, like-- I have it right up there.
You definitely did.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.414
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't me.
That would've been Morag.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.583
Is-- Morag is a person?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.626
Morag. Yes. That was my first wife.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.671
She used to answer
all my fan mail, you know?

18:07.671 --> 18:09.548
And, um, she was a poet.

18:09.548 --> 18:13.635
She definitely--
She would've used the word "throes."

18:13.635 --> 18:15.846
I mean, she had a tendency
towards the dramatic,

18:15.846 --> 18:17.431
which was unfortunate.

18:17.431 --> 18:20.434
But she had really good taste
in other people's work.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.229
And she loved fish. Shellfish.

18:25.439 --> 18:29.401
So "Surf, Surf, and Surf"
would've been right up her alley.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.404
[inhales] Well, okay.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.366
Jess, please sit.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.951
Oh, no, it's okay.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.578
I actually...

18:40.954 --> 18:43.582
I need to use the, uh, outhouse.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.460
Then I will tackle the dishes.
You stay right there.

18:47.711 --> 18:48.545
[door closes]

18:48.545 --> 18:51.048
He's a really good guy, Mom.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.549
FRANKIE:
He seems wonderful.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.552
And he obviously adores you.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.347
But you are both just so young.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.974
I just don't want you
to make the same mistakes I did.

19:01.475 --> 19:02.476
CLARE:
Okay, well...

19:05.020 --> 19:07.147
Jess isn't Dad, and I'm not you.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.820
I don't wanna live like this forever.

19:14.571 --> 19:19.993
There's a whole world out there
of art and... culture

19:19.993 --> 19:22.412
and-- and rooms full of books.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.539
And I want that.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.750
You should have whatever you want.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.753
Okay. Well, I want more than this.

19:35.968 --> 19:36.969
[door opens]

19:36.969 --> 19:39.388
Whoo! Hello!

19:40.264 --> 19:45.060
So, there's, like, a fire-pit jamboree
or something tonight, if you wanna--

19:45.060 --> 19:46.562
What are you doing?

19:46.562 --> 19:47.938
I-- I think I'm gonna head out.

19:48.897 --> 19:49.898
[Amy sighs]

19:52.526 --> 19:54.027
I'm sorry if this...

19:55.612 --> 19:57.406
feels hard for you.

19:57.406 --> 20:00.075
Who said anything
about anything being hard?

20:00.075 --> 20:02.327
Why can't you even pretend
to be happy for me?

20:02.911 --> 20:05.664
What?
Amy, I am so happy for you.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.834
Okay. You're happy for me?
CLARE: I am.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.669
I mean,
you got a book deal 20 years ago,

20:10.669 --> 20:13.505
and I've been busting my ass
trying to catch up ever since.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.506
16 years ago.

20:15.591 --> 20:16.800
And then I had Rae.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.302
Okay, so...

20:19.428 --> 20:21.763
you-- you got the thing
that you chose to do,

20:21.763 --> 20:23.724
but yet, you're
not really that happy for me

20:23.724 --> 20:26.268
when I get the thing that I <i>chose</i> to do.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.978
That's not fair.
AMY: It's not?

20:27.978 --> 20:31.231
I've been with you,
side by side, neck and neck,

20:31.231 --> 20:35.319
for every single little and big event
in your entire life.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.821
I've been there for your wedding to Danny,

20:37.821 --> 20:39.656
all the kid's birthday parties,

20:39.656 --> 20:42.284
the snot noses, the discolored shits.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.871
Your joys were my joys.
Your bummers were my bummers.

20:45.871 --> 20:49.708
And you can't even,
I don't know, be happy for me!

20:49.708 --> 20:51.585
Because I was happy for you

20:51.585 --> 20:55.339
when you got <i>all</i> the things
that you wanted that I didn't get.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.883
That's different. That's, like--
You didn't want those things!

20:57.883 --> 20:59.927
AMY:
How do you know what I want?

20:59.927 --> 21:01.094
It's, like, you just--

21:02.930 --> 21:04.389
I'm sorry, but you just act like

21:04.389 --> 21:06.517
you're the only fucking person
in the entire world

that didn't get your heart's desire.

21:08.769 --> 21:09.770
You didn't write a book.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.940
You didn't... write... the book.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.942
You didn't become the writer

21:14.942 --> 21:17.528
that you imagined
that you were going to become.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.821

And it's not Danny's fault.

And it's <i>definitely</i> not Rae's fault.

I did betray your trust.

I, uh...

29:32.648 --> 29:33.649
I disappeared.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.486
I emotionally bailed

29:38.362 --> 29:39.738

29:40.447 --> 29:42.616

people think it's really good.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.006
And I'm gonna do it.

29:58.006 --> 30:00.425
I'm gonna work on it. Full time.

30:00.425 --> 30:04.096
So don't be mad,
but I-- I wanna quit my job, okay?

30:04.096 --> 30:06.098
And I-- I-- I know I just took it on,

30:06.098 --> 30:07.683

that's what has to happen.

30:07.683 --> 30:08.559

at the outlets, and that's it.
