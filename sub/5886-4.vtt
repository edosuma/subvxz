WEBVTT

00:00.532 --> 00:01.962
I want to stop doing this.

00:02.342 --> 00:04.006
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:04.367 --> 00:07.546
It's been my privilege
to be treated like a protégé

00:07.651 --> 00:09.297
and for you to be my mentor.

00:09.451 --> 00:11.217
We're going to
lose Jaguar unless

00:11.324 --> 00:12.843
an arrangement is made...

00:12.905 --> 00:14.437
Tell them I want a partnership.

00:14.751 --> 00:16.681
My wife's a big TV star.

00:17.924 --> 00:18.919
Break a leg.

00:19.730 --> 00:20.722
<i>Beans came in today.</i>

00:20.805 --> 00:22.670
And he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself

00:22.776 --> 00:24.600
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.522
I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz ketchup.

01:08.711 --> 01:10.479
So you haven't
officially told anyone

01:10.547 --> 01:12.147
you're looking to change
your life?

01:12.215 --> 01:14.115
Yes.

01:14.184 --> 01:16.251
Why put Doyle Dane
into hysterics

01:16.319 --> 01:18.887
when all I want to do
is have what NASA calls

01:18.954 --> 01:21.656
an "exploratory mission"
with your agency?

01:21.723 --> 01:25.926
Still, Timmy, Don has
some anxiety about--

01:25.994 --> 01:28.496
well, obviously about Raymond.

01:29.998 --> 01:31.632
Heinz Baked Beans has given us

01:31.700 --> 01:34.335
national recognition
and Raymond's a friend.

01:34.403 --> 01:37.003
I'm not used to telling people
what my account is worth.

01:37.071 --> 01:38.438
Not just in billings,

01:38.506 --> 01:40.540
but in the prestige
that comes with ketchup.

01:40.608 --> 01:42.342
Don knows that
or he wouldn't be here.

01:42.410 --> 01:43.476
He's not that polite.

01:44.912 --> 01:46.446
Just relax.

01:46.514 --> 01:48.381
If you do the work
and I like it,

01:48.449 --> 01:50.250
I guarantee that Raymond
will fall in line.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.783
I have that power.

01:51.851 --> 01:53.385
And if you don't like our work?

01:53.453 --> 01:55.654
Raymond never has to know.

01:55.722 --> 01:57.456
I don't know if that
solves my problem.

01:57.524 --> 01:59.958
Look, I understand your risk.

02:00.026 --> 02:01.660
Or we could have met
in your office again.

02:01.728 --> 02:04.896
In fact, we can have
the presentation here, too.

02:04.964 --> 02:06.398
No, we'll get a hotel.

02:08.032 --> 02:10.901
I am supposed to be meeting
someone in about 20 minutes

02:10.969 --> 02:12.570
and she likes me
to wait for her.

02:15.574 --> 02:17.609
Well, take your time.

02:17.676 --> 02:19.744
And remember,

02:19.811 --> 02:21.546
I don't need much of an
excuse to come to Manhattan.

02:36.561 --> 02:39.095
When I say a small team,
I mean Stan.

02:39.163 --> 02:40.963
Just the three of us.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.865
We bill it under Project K.

02:44.401 --> 02:46.335
Nice place.

02:46.403 --> 02:49.004
Well, it's available to you.

02:49.072 --> 02:52.308
You know, if you ever have to
spend the night in the city.

02:52.376 --> 02:53.976
I live here, Pete.

03:02.017 --> 03:04.152
It's been 7:00
for 20 minutes.

03:04.219 --> 03:06.120
I'm starving.

03:06.188 --> 03:08.623
I'm sorry I'm late,
but I have a job.

03:08.691 --> 03:10.958
You know what, Dawn?
You have another job,

03:11.026 --> 03:12.526
which is being
my maid of honor.

03:12.594 --> 03:15.028
Well, I can't lose
that one, can I?

03:15.096 --> 03:18.131
Well, I have some bad news.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.100
Al called me

03:20.168 --> 03:22.469
and he said both the caterer
and your date fell through.

03:22.537 --> 03:25.005
William?
What happened?

03:25.072 --> 03:27.207
Al doesn't think
he's ready to settle down.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.309
And he didn't want you to spend
the night defending yourself.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.143
You tell Al to keep looking

03:31.211 --> 03:33.145
because I'm never gonna meet
someone at that office.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.380
Al and I met at church.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.148
Church is impossible.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.584
You can't stand out
in that crowd of harlots.

03:38.652 --> 03:42.288
You stand out.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.723
You must run into
somebody downtown.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.559
I get on the train
and it's just us...

03:47.627 --> 03:50.529
and then it gets thinner
and thinner until about 72nd.

03:50.596 --> 03:52.931
Sometimes it's just me
and this old shoeshine--

03:52.998 --> 03:54.800
and he won't even look at me.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.202
Bea Carter says her son
Anthony ran into you.

03:57.269 --> 03:59.637
But that's what
you don't understand.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.639
We were walking
through the plaza

04:01.707 --> 04:03.708
and we passed each other
and we just nodded.

04:03.775 --> 04:05.776
Someone told me he said that,

04:05.844 --> 04:07.911
but he didn't talk to me.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.613
And I didn't talk
to him, either.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.284
Well, I'll keep looking.

04:17.855 --> 04:19.288
That might be too much blush.

04:19.357 --> 04:22.191
If you look a little rusty,
it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.

04:22.259 --> 04:24.327
I need all the help I can get.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.896
The makeup's
not the important part.

04:26.964 --> 04:30.132
Mary Kay always says it's really
about making yourself feel better,

04:30.200 --> 04:33.702
and that starts with
doing something for you.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.303
Well, that'll be a first.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.376
- Kate!
- Shh, I just put the baby down.

04:43.747 --> 04:46.314
- You have not changed.
- Well, you have.

04:46.383 --> 04:48.416
How did you suddenly
get younger than me?

04:48.484 --> 04:49.884
Because she's in
the beauty business.

04:49.951 --> 04:51.753
What do you think?

04:51.820 --> 04:54.154
- How much did she spend?
- It's free.

04:54.222 --> 04:56.724
This is my old stuff.
I'm a sales director now.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.626
- How are your boys?
- Good.

04:58.694 --> 05:00.561
- Did you see Kevin?
- She looked in.

05:00.629 --> 05:03.163
Why don't we let him sleep
while we eat dinner?

05:03.231 --> 05:04.631
I made a pork roast.

05:04.699 --> 05:07.233
And I made reservations
at Le Cirque for two.

05:07.301 --> 05:10.336
Well, I want to catch up.
And, more importantly,

05:10.405 --> 05:13.172
Kate has a job interview tomorrow
and I don't want her tying one on.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.375
- Who are you meeting with?
- The competition.

05:15.443 --> 05:17.343
Can we take a raincheck?

05:17.412 --> 05:19.478
Splendid.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.747
She hasn't changed.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.991
Why are you getting on
the elevator going up?

05:33.059 --> 05:35.327
Because the door opened
and you were standing there.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.030
I pressed down.

05:46.806 --> 05:48.840
Where have you been?

05:48.908 --> 05:51.075
I missed you.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.076
Working all the time.
Don't tell anyone.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.712
Like who?

05:55.780 --> 05:58.348
Arnie's on call
Thursday or Friday.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.551
I'll leave a penny under the
mat when he's flown the coop.

06:10.461 --> 06:11.994
I have to go.

06:15.699 --> 06:17.333
Can you be more specific?

06:19.069 --> 06:20.703
Nope.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.572
Good night.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.517
Dennis must be doing well.

06:35.585 --> 06:37.953
- That's from the company.
- My goodness.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.553
What do you have to do
to get this?

06:39.621 --> 06:41.889
Just have a lot of my recruits
sell a lot of Mary Kay.

06:41.957 --> 06:43.724
How much?
Those are diamonds.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.425
Just has to be the most.

06:45.494 --> 06:47.060
They know what they're doing.

06:47.128 --> 06:48.929
I know.
They do.

06:48.997 --> 06:51.131
But there's no way
for me to move up there.

06:51.199 --> 06:52.700
So is that why
you're going to Avon?

06:52.767 --> 06:54.401
There's women
above me at Mary Kay,

06:54.469 --> 06:56.536
It's just working
out of Spokane,

06:56.604 --> 06:59.205
there's only so far I can go.

06:59.272 --> 07:01.641
Well, Joanie's a partner
and I don't know if anyone

07:01.709 --> 07:03.510
would want all that
extra responsibility.

07:03.577 --> 07:05.678
You should visit more often.

07:05.746 --> 07:07.413
Turns out
someone's proud of me.

07:07.481 --> 07:09.382
I'm a monster.

07:09.449 --> 07:12.384
Believe it or not,
"My daughter is a partner

07:12.451 --> 07:14.720
at a Madison Avenue
advertising firm"

07:14.787 --> 07:17.155
is something I enjoy saying.

07:17.223 --> 07:18.557
It does sound pretty good.

07:22.762 --> 07:26.464
Well, so much for keeping
my wits about me.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.866
I should be getting
back to the Waldorf.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.768
Well, I wish you
the best of luck tomorrow.

07:30.836 --> 07:32.069
But if worse come to worse,

07:32.137 --> 07:33.838
you're appreciated somewhere.

07:38.544 --> 07:41.111
What are the "Life" magazine
closing dates for Birds Eye?

07:41.179 --> 07:43.980
Ken, it's Monday.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.182
I got a perfect cup of coffee
and a Danish on the way.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.284
You want to start with "Good morning?
How was your weekend?"

07:48.352 --> 07:51.821
I spent it with my in-laws
listening to Ed complain

07:51.889 --> 07:54.490
about how much the world
hates Dow Chemical.

07:54.559 --> 07:57.260
And I know that every gripe he has
is directed at me and this company.

07:57.327 --> 08:00.429
Is it possible that this has turned
Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?

08:00.496 --> 08:02.264
If he wants people
to stop hating him,

08:02.331 --> 08:05.868
he should stop dropping
napalm on children.

08:07.537 --> 08:09.271
I know you just came
here to complain,

08:09.338 --> 08:11.106
but I actually think
that I can help you.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.442
God, that's really true.

08:13.509 --> 08:15.477
I just came in here
to complain.

08:15.545 --> 08:17.344
How hard would it be to meet
with Ed, just you and me?

08:17.412 --> 08:19.814
If I have a good reason?

08:19.882 --> 08:21.749
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove,
but it's the last one.

08:21.817 --> 08:23.184
- Did you find your keys?
- I did.

08:23.251 --> 08:25.152
Can you get Pierre
Cossette on the line?

08:25.220 --> 08:26.754
I have an idea.
Let's see what happens.

08:26.822 --> 08:28.355
Harry has great ideas.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.642
I saw this thing on a spy show.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.177
It's a clock
with a tiny camera in it.

08:52.245 --> 08:55.114
All we have to do
is get it in there.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.116
If you can get in,
you don't need a clock.

08:58.551 --> 09:00.586
I would guess
it's a military account.

09:00.654 --> 09:02.622
And I would guess
they picked Stan

09:02.689 --> 09:04.255
because he has no conscience.

09:04.323 --> 09:08.159
So Project K stands for what?

09:08.227 --> 09:10.428
Project Kill Machine!

09:10.496 --> 09:11.963
That's not what it stands for.

09:12.031 --> 09:15.433
So what does
it stand for, Bobby?

09:15.501 --> 09:17.335
I don't know what it is.

09:17.402 --> 09:19.137
Are you saying that because
you <i>do</i> know what it is?

09:19.204 --> 09:20.671
No.

09:20.772 --> 09:23.340
- Stan come through?
- Stan who?

09:23.407 --> 09:26.309
I know one thing-- he's not in
a room with tinfoil on the windows.

09:26.377 --> 09:28.178
How are things, Don?

09:39.356 --> 09:41.024
There's nothing in here.

09:41.091 --> 09:42.825
'Cause you're gonna
fill it with work.

09:42.893 --> 09:44.994
- If you don't fall asleep.
- Mmm.

09:46.796 --> 09:49.131
I'm telling you,
it clears the cobwebs.

10:04.012 --> 10:06.246
I think a hot dog and a
hamburger are too similar.

10:07.916 --> 10:10.217
Plus, a hot dog
cries out for mustard.

10:10.285 --> 10:13.587
No, I think a hot dog
cries out for ketchup.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.224
A squiggly line.

10:20.261 --> 10:22.496
Hmm.

10:22.564 --> 10:24.531
I think we should order lunch.

10:31.406 --> 10:33.373
Mmm.

10:33.441 --> 10:36.141
My goodness. Someone's having
a party and didn't invite us.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.544
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:38.612 --> 10:41.214
Is Clara's birthday today?

10:41.281 --> 10:43.916
It's tomorrow
and it's $2 a head.

10:43.983 --> 10:45.951
And, actually, I don't know
what I'm going to get.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.221
- Do you want to come?
- I can't.

10:48.288 --> 10:50.255
Mr. Draper
always needs me.

10:50.323 --> 10:52.757
Could you punch me out
when you leave?

10:52.825 --> 10:54.526
Really?

10:55.994 --> 10:57.962
How long are you
going to be gone?

10:58.030 --> 10:59.797
Well, if you punch me out...

11:01.100 --> 11:03.101
Okay.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.537
I heard Mr. Draper's
in there.

11:07.071 --> 11:09.273
No.

11:12.510 --> 11:15.078
- Did you get the pages?
- No.

11:15.146 --> 11:16.714
Are you two rehearsing already?

11:16.781 --> 11:18.582
Call me when you see them.

11:18.650 --> 11:20.217
Arlene, are you sad
it's not you?

11:20.285 --> 11:22.018
You know Mel is my husband.

11:22.086 --> 11:23.919
I could have him write you
into a hospital bed

11:23.987 --> 11:25.388
or a grave.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.729
I'm sorry.

11:37.268 --> 11:38.667
What's going on?

11:38.735 --> 11:42.638
Well, you're going to have
a love scene with Rod.

11:42.705 --> 11:45.407
And between you, me, and
soon a national audience,

11:45.475 --> 11:46.742
it's more of a love affair.

11:46.809 --> 11:49.344
Oh, my goodness.

11:49.412 --> 11:51.112
That's so exciting.

11:51.180 --> 11:53.014
Thank you for telling me.

11:53.082 --> 11:54.282
Oh, I did more than tell you.

11:54.349 --> 11:56.317
Mel's been on the fence,

11:56.385 --> 11:58.986
but I think he really
believes in you.

11:59.053 --> 12:00.688
Now, don't embarrass me.

12:00.756 --> 12:02.189
You've done this
before, haven't you?

12:02.257 --> 12:04.825
Um, well, of course.

12:06.395 --> 12:07.828
Does a high school play count?

12:07.896 --> 12:09.196
No.

12:10.631 --> 12:12.231
It's gonna be exciting at first

12:12.300 --> 12:13.433
and then it'll be
part of the job.

12:13.501 --> 12:16.169
It's pretty exciting.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.906
The hard part is how "James
Garner" there will deal with it.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.875
Some people think it's better to
wait till after it's happened

12:22.943 --> 12:26.078
or not tell them at all, but I
think it's best to be up front.

12:27.847 --> 12:31.383
Well, obviously
he's not going to like it.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.352
Would you be upset if he did?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.355
I don't know.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.291
Why don't Mel and I take
you two out to dinner?

12:39.359 --> 12:42.027
You know, to make
him comfortable.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.295
And, honestly, all of us
should be better acquainted.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.864
I mean, Mel has
big plans for you.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.939
I'm gonna leave
you alone with these.

13:05.182 --> 13:07.684
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere?
- No, Meredith.

13:07.752 --> 13:10.587
Well, it's just I can't
find her or Mr. Crane

13:10.655 --> 13:11.888
and there's someone to see him.

13:11.956 --> 13:13.156
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.

13:17.126 --> 13:19.061
How are you?

13:19.128 --> 13:20.730
Busy.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.633
Have Scarlett see me
when you find her.

13:30.973 --> 13:33.908
Oh, good.
You're home on time.

13:33.976 --> 13:36.344
I am. It's only because
I have a lot of work

13:36.412 --> 13:38.246
and I don't want to do
it in a windowless room.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.885
So why don't you have a seat?

13:43.952 --> 13:45.286
I'm gonna get you a drink.

13:45.354 --> 13:48.054
And then I'm gonna
stuff you with coq au vin.

13:49.858 --> 13:51.692
I know you're very busy,

13:51.760 --> 13:55.629
but I want us to have,
I don't know--

13:55.697 --> 13:58.665
I want us to be able to talk
about things other than work.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.501
Megan, what happened?

14:00.568 --> 14:02.869
Just once I'd like
to be that wife

14:02.936 --> 14:05.838
that lays a trap and has her
husband walk right into it.

14:05.906 --> 14:08.841
Okay, first of all, Arlene,

14:08.909 --> 14:10.777
you know, she plays
Penelope Aldridge.

14:10.844 --> 14:12.912
She basically owns
"Berkshire Falls."

14:12.979 --> 14:15.281
She's married to Mel
the head writer

14:15.348 --> 14:17.316
and they want to have
dinner with us.

14:17.384 --> 14:18.650
Does it get worse?

14:21.153 --> 14:24.756
Well, my storyline
is getting more developed

14:24.824 --> 14:27.025
and that means

14:27.092 --> 14:29.227
I'm gonna have
a series of love scenes.

14:29.295 --> 14:31.596
- With whom?
- With Rod Holly.

14:31.664 --> 14:33.932
He plays Rafe Jackson.
He's Arlene's nephew.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.900
Megan, I don't care.

14:35.967 --> 14:38.636
What's a "love scene"
consist of?

14:38.703 --> 14:41.305
It's just kissing and hugging.

14:41.372 --> 14:44.308
It's TV. We can't
really do anything.

14:46.812 --> 14:48.546
What am I supposed to say?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.848
That you trust me.

14:51.915 --> 14:55.517
And that you know
it's part of my job.

14:55.585 --> 14:59.188
And maybe that it was bound to
happen if things went well.

14:59.256 --> 15:01.090
Keep going. I'm dying to
hear what I say next.

15:01.158 --> 15:02.325
Should I have
hidden it from you?

15:05.929 --> 15:07.729
I don't know, Megan.
I need to think about it.

15:09.298 --> 15:11.799
Look, I know
I wouldn't like it,

15:11.868 --> 15:14.402
but I'd look
on the bright side.

15:14.470 --> 15:17.638
Okay, I guess if I
wasn't your husband,

15:17.706 --> 15:19.107
I would be happy for you.

15:19.175 --> 15:21.009
It does mean they like you.

15:21.077 --> 15:23.410
Do you like me?

15:23.478 --> 15:26.513
Honey, I can tolerate this,
but I can't encourage it.

15:28.049 --> 15:29.616
You're perfect.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.927
And, honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken
who's been losing sleep about this.

15:38.995 --> 15:40.563
<i>I mean, last week when half of
Colombia got into your lobby--</i>

15:40.630 --> 15:43.098
It was 15 people.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.867
Look, you've been in
the news every other day

15:45.935 --> 15:47.602
and a couple of articles
placed in business journals

15:47.670 --> 15:49.003
are not going
to make that stop.

15:49.071 --> 15:51.539
They acted like they
were storming the Bastille.

15:51.607 --> 15:53.341
This is their country, too.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.511
What exactly is your point?

15:56.579 --> 15:58.446
Pierre.

15:58.514 --> 16:01.882
A one-hour prime-time TV
special sponsored by Dow,

16:01.950 --> 16:04.318
starring Joe Namath and 15
or so of his best friends

16:04.385 --> 16:07.521
putting on a show drawing from
America's most beloved musicals.

16:07.589 --> 16:09.923
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

16:09.990 --> 16:11.191
Joe Namath sings?

16:11.258 --> 16:13.760
Don't you want to watch
it just to find out?

16:13.828 --> 16:16.863
And who are his "friends"?

16:16.931 --> 16:18.998
I have access to the
greatest talent available.

16:19.066 --> 16:21.567
There'll be sex appeal. Joey
Heatherton, for example.

16:21.635 --> 16:24.170
Pipes, Julie Andrews.
And punch.

16:24.238 --> 16:27.339
How about John Wayne in a
sketch version of "Camelot"?

16:27.406 --> 16:29.842
We're mostly
household products.

16:29.909 --> 16:31.143
Women don't like football.

16:31.211 --> 16:33.078
Have you ever asked them
about Joe Namath?

16:33.146 --> 16:34.880
Forget demographics.

16:34.948 --> 16:37.750
How would you like Dow to be
responsible for making people smile?

16:39.418 --> 16:41.220
And is there anything
that makes people smile

16:41.287 --> 16:42.987
more than Broadway
and football?

16:43.055 --> 16:44.822
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" and
the Notre Dame fight song

16:44.890 --> 16:46.657
playing at the same time.

16:46.725 --> 16:49.393
♪ I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy... ♪

16:49.461 --> 16:51.528
♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪

16:51.596 --> 16:53.965
Okay, okay.

16:54.032 --> 16:56.700
Kenny, did you tell them
I went to Notre Dame?

16:56.769 --> 16:59.002
No, I told them
about Joey Heatherton.

17:01.572 --> 17:03.573
So it's tailor-made
for us?

17:05.209 --> 17:06.342
What's our commitment?

17:06.410 --> 17:07.978
Well, you'd be a corner tenant.

17:08.045 --> 17:10.046
There's six minutes
of commercials in the hour,

17:10.114 --> 17:12.816
you'd get three and then
two 10-second billboards

17:12.884 --> 17:15.151
at the beginning
and end of the show.

17:15.218 --> 17:16.919
"Brought to you
by Dow Chemical,

17:16.987 --> 17:19.021
family products
for the American family."

17:22.492 --> 17:25.761
Just imagine
Joe Namath in a straw hat.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.039
I'm sorry
to bother you, Scarlett,

17:38.107 --> 17:40.275
but is Mr. Crane in?

17:40.342 --> 17:43.311
Okay.
No, he's in a meeting.

17:43.378 --> 17:44.745
Is there something
I can help you with?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.480
Well, if he's expecting
any special guests,

17:47.548 --> 17:50.383
you should let us know because he had someone
come yesterday and you weren't here.

17:50.451 --> 17:52.752
I must have been
in the ladies' room.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.723
No, and it's strange because
you didn't leave until 6:47.

17:56.791 --> 17:58.926
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's
birthday today

17:58.993 --> 18:01.261
and I tried to go at lunch,
but I got stuck at my desk.

18:01.329 --> 18:03.595
So I left Mr. Crane
on his own

18:03.663 --> 18:05.331
while I attended
to this company business.

18:07.567 --> 18:10.536
We got her a Givenchy
scarf from Gimbels.

18:10.603 --> 18:13.339
I have the card here
for you to sign.

18:13.406 --> 18:15.975
But you never came back and you
had Dawn punch your time card.

18:16.043 --> 18:17.743
No, Dawn and I
were working together.

18:17.811 --> 18:19.811
But we were all over the place.

18:19.879 --> 18:22.981
But mostly in accounting.

18:23.049 --> 18:25.250
Thank you for clearing that up.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.960
Dawn.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.028
Have you spoken
to Scarlett this morning?

18:38.096 --> 18:40.898
We're missing the big hole punch and I
think you were the last one to see her.

18:40.966 --> 18:43.067
The hole punch
is in the creative lounge.

18:43.134 --> 18:45.535
Dawn, Scarlett
told me everything.

18:48.907 --> 18:50.174
Scarlett, you're fired.

18:52.877 --> 18:55.945
Joan, please.
It won't happen again.

18:56.013 --> 18:58.814
Not here it won't.
Go get your things.

18:58.883 --> 19:00.516
<i>Dawn, could you get Stan in here</i>

19:00.584 --> 19:02.718
- <i>before the partners meeting?</i>
- I'll deal with you later.

19:06.257 --> 19:08.323
Girls do it all the time.

19:08.391 --> 19:10.392
Just go before you really
embarrass yourself.

19:15.999 --> 19:18.367
I hope you realize this means
now you're on Ed's radar.

19:18.434 --> 19:20.369
So will I be invited
to Sunday dinner?

19:20.436 --> 19:21.937
Something like that.

19:23.939 --> 19:26.374
I don't know where you're going, but
I want you to bring back champagne.

19:26.441 --> 19:29.777
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.

19:29.844 --> 19:31.112
What are you talking about?

19:34.049 --> 19:36.483
Joan, you owe
Scarlett an apology.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.552
Harry, please don't
involve yourself in this.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.720
I'm tired of your
petty dictatorship.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.790
So whatever capital crime or treason
she committed, she's in my department.

19:43.857 --> 19:46.226
I didn't realize you were
that attached to Scarlett.

19:46.294 --> 19:48.895
- We're not attached.
- We are attached!

19:48.963 --> 19:50.931
I have something
more important to do.

19:50.998 --> 19:52.799
I would hope you do, too.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.369
Scarlett, do whatever
you think is best.

19:57.437 --> 19:59.704
You are to do
whatever <i>I</i> think is best.

20:10.283 --> 20:11.849
Let's go.
Back to work.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.717
Everything's fine.

20:21.293 --> 20:23.061
I understand
the confidentiality,

20:23.128 --> 20:24.562
but I need to know
how to bill Project K.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.134
Don't.

20:31.202 --> 20:32.769
Meredith, why
don't you step out?

20:35.440 --> 20:38.442
I don't know what she said because I'm
not privy to these conversations,

20:38.509 --> 20:39.809
but I would like the chance
to defend myself.

20:39.877 --> 20:42.045
- Mr. Crane, I haven't--
- No, please.

20:42.113 --> 20:44.213
<i>Let him go on.</i>

20:46.749 --> 20:49.685
Well, it's this simple-- Scarlett works
for me and Joan tried to fire her.

20:49.752 --> 20:51.854
She left work early and had
Dawn punch her time card.

20:51.921 --> 20:53.822
It's pay for a minimum
of five hours of work

20:53.890 --> 20:56.625
that she didn't do
that we are paying for.

20:56.693 --> 20:58.594
Well, it's either me or her.

20:58.661 --> 21:01.062
- Joan?
- Scarlett.

21:01.130 --> 21:04.632
I think you mean,
"If she goes, I go."

21:04.700 --> 21:06.634
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

21:06.702 --> 21:09.604
Is there anybody in here
who thought of that?

21:09.671 --> 21:12.240
- I did.
- What the hell is that?

21:12.308 --> 21:15.275
It's $150,000 worth
of incremental business

21:15.343 --> 21:18.178
I generated while solving a problem.
For what?

21:18.246 --> 21:20.814
So I can stand outside that glass
and watch you all in here?

21:20.882 --> 21:23.083
- What did Dawn do?
- Well, I'm almost positive--

21:23.151 --> 21:25.252
Just keep talking to her
because she's a partner.

21:26.521 --> 21:28.055
You know what?

21:28.123 --> 21:30.057
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happened in broad daylight

21:30.125 --> 21:32.525
and I can't be given
the same rewards.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.160
What is that supposed to mean?

21:34.194 --> 21:36.662
You know damn well.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.963
The next time this group
is called to order,

21:38.032 --> 21:39.798
I expect to be sitting
at this table.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.168
I've actually earned it.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.450
Don't worry, dear.
That's not going to happen.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.553
Joan, I don't want to put myself
in the same camp as Harry,

22:01.620 --> 22:03.620
but I might remind you
and everyone

22:03.688 --> 22:06.390
the Commission on Human Rights
is continuing to investigate

22:06.458 --> 22:09.026
our industry regarding
the employment of Negroes.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.062
She's a good secretary.

22:11.129 --> 22:12.896
Of course.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.932
What about Scarlett?

22:14.999 --> 22:18.102
I think this humiliation
will suffice.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.869
Can we continue
with the billings?

22:19.937 --> 22:21.837
Yes.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.339
Where were we?

22:25.809 --> 22:28.211
"Meredith, why don't you
step out?"

22:28.279 --> 22:30.080
Well?

22:30.147 --> 22:32.082
Oh.

22:40.038 --> 22:42.607
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't leave.

22:42.674 --> 22:45.343
I don't care as long as you
brought those bridal magazines.

22:45.411 --> 22:47.178
What is wrong with you?

22:47.246 --> 22:49.647
I had a day today that
pushed your stupid wedding

22:49.715 --> 22:51.048
to the bottom of the list.

22:51.117 --> 22:53.017
- Did you get fired?
- No.

22:53.085 --> 22:54.985
I don't think so.

22:55.052 --> 22:56.920
Who can tell at that place?

22:56.988 --> 22:58.888
What happened?

22:58.956 --> 23:00.857
One of the girls
asked me to punch out

23:00.925 --> 23:02.726
her time card
and we got caught.

23:02.793 --> 23:04.894
I told you, those girls
aren't your friends.

23:04.962 --> 23:07.030
Yes, they are. She got
in more trouble than me.

23:07.098 --> 23:09.132
Why do you think she asked you?

23:09.199 --> 23:11.367
You can't say no
'cause you're too scared.

23:11.435 --> 23:12.868
All they see is,
"Yes, sir."

23:12.936 --> 23:14.470
Everybody's scared there.

23:14.538 --> 23:16.939
Women crying
in the ladies' room.

23:17.007 --> 23:18.608
Men crying in the elevator.

23:18.675 --> 23:21.210
It sounds like New Year's Eve
when they empty the garbage,

23:21.278 --> 23:23.078
<i>there are so many bottles.</i>

23:23.147 --> 23:26.114
And I told you about that poor man
hanging himself in his office.

23:26.182 --> 23:27.982
Oh, they got it so bad,

23:28.050 --> 23:30.084
they must all
be jealous of you.

23:30.153 --> 23:32.887
What am I gonna do? Throw a
brick through their window?

23:34.657 --> 23:36.958
I want to keep my job,

23:37.026 --> 23:39.027
so I'm gonna keep my head down.

23:39.094 --> 23:41.562
Well, I couldn't do it.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.864
Well, you don't have to.

23:43.931 --> 23:45.132
You're getting married.

23:46.734 --> 23:48.569
And dinner.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.939
<i>I should have brought Dennis.</i>

23:53.007 --> 23:55.142
You're not even
listening to me.

23:55.210 --> 23:57.110
I'm sorry.
I need a drink

23:57.178 --> 23:58.811
and this place
is a soda fountain.

23:58.879 --> 24:01.681
I feel like I'm in high school
right down to the clientele.

24:04.285 --> 24:06.085
Hello?

24:07.521 --> 24:09.322
We're sitting here waiting
for a phone to ring.

24:09.390 --> 24:10.523
This actually is high school.

24:10.591 --> 24:12.192
So what do you do to have fun?

24:12.259 --> 24:13.292
I don't look in a guidebook.

24:13.359 --> 24:15.394
This wasn't in
a guidebook, okay?

24:15.461 --> 24:17.028
My friend told me about it.

24:17.096 --> 24:19.931
Is she a nun or just the
right age for this place?

24:19.999 --> 24:23.902
Apparently there are
quite a few men here

24:23.969 --> 24:25.671
who go for a certain type.

24:26.839 --> 24:28.307
Oh.

24:28.374 --> 24:30.741
Joanie, don't judge me.
I'm in New York.

24:38.049 --> 24:39.783
Good evening, ladies.

24:39.851 --> 24:41.652
If there's anything you need,
I'll be over there.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.721
Catherine's got a lot
of tables, so don't hesitate.

24:43.788 --> 24:45.655
I'm Leo.

24:45.723 --> 24:48.391
I'm Kate.
And this is Joan.

24:52.029 --> 24:55.232
Actually, I don't think
our phone is working.

24:55.299 --> 24:58.101
- Can you test it?
- I'll see what I can do.

25:00.904 --> 25:03.805
How many girls come in here and
complain that their phones are broken?

25:03.873 --> 25:06.609
He's cute.
Reminds me of Scotty.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.310
Well, don't marry him.

25:08.378 --> 25:10.212
That was the worst
six months of my life.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.047
You always did
everything first.

25:12.115 --> 25:14.383
But you did everything smart.

25:14.451 --> 25:17.553
Well, tonight we're just
a couple of young secretaries.

25:20.790 --> 25:21.823
Answer it.

25:23.893 --> 25:25.693
Ahem.
Hello?

25:25.762 --> 25:27.295
How did you do that?

25:27.363 --> 25:28.897
I didn't do anything.
He likes you.

25:28.965 --> 25:30.899
What?

25:32.034 --> 25:33.601
Oh.

25:33.669 --> 25:35.570
Just a minute.
Let me ask my girlfriend.

25:35.638 --> 25:37.438
He wants us to meet him
after his shift.

25:37.506 --> 25:38.973
Well, tell him
you know a place.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.175
But I don't.
Do you?

25:41.243 --> 25:43.444
- Should I invite him to my room?
- No.

25:43.512 --> 25:45.813
We were just trying
to think of a place.

25:45.881 --> 25:47.114
Tell him to think of a place.

25:47.182 --> 25:48.849
Do you know of a place?

25:48.917 --> 25:50.550
Oh, good.

25:50.618 --> 25:53.320
- Hang up.
- Till then.

25:55.323 --> 25:56.923
Okay, now I need a drink.

25:59.594 --> 26:01.828
Do you honestly believe
a few jokes

26:01.896 --> 26:04.564
on the "Smothers Brothers"
are really upsetting people?

26:04.632 --> 26:06.599
<i>I think it's the sponsors</i>
<i>and the network</i>

26:06.667 --> 26:08.867
don't want to have
a conversation about the war.

26:08.935 --> 26:12.070
I'd like to have an evening without
a conversation about the war.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.540
<i>Darling, you</i>
<i>shouldn't smoke so much.</i>

26:14.608 --> 26:16.475
The weight you lose
isn't worth the wrinkles.

26:16.543 --> 26:18.644
<i>See, I think the sponsors</i>
<i>are for the war.</i>

26:18.712 --> 26:20.713
They don't want to have
any dissent.

26:20.781 --> 26:23.748
Don, you're a writer.
You know this is censorship.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.418
I am a writer
and I'm against the war,

26:26.485 --> 26:29.721
but when you buy a commercial,

26:29.789 --> 26:31.323
you're hoping that the consumer

26:31.390 --> 26:32.990
is in a good mood when
they hear your message.

26:33.058 --> 26:36.127
So if you agree on
a wholesome variety show

26:36.195 --> 26:38.062
and all of a sudden
it's filled with satire--

26:38.130 --> 26:40.364
the most threatening
humor there is--

26:40.432 --> 26:43.066
you're worried about people
hating what you're selling.

26:44.769 --> 26:48.305
Megan, let's talk about you

26:48.373 --> 26:51.375
and how you found this man.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.477
I could cast
you, you know that.

26:54.545 --> 26:57.747
Yes, I'm sure he is a man
who plays many roles.

26:57.815 --> 27:01.050
Luckily you don't have
to worry about censorship

27:01.117 --> 27:04.019
with the show
because it's so tame.

27:04.087 --> 27:06.155
<i>Of course it's for
daytime entertainment.</i>

27:06.223 --> 27:07.990
It's for housewives.

27:08.058 --> 27:10.826
It has to be
a little titillating.

27:10.893 --> 27:12.828
<i>We have our own standards.</i>

27:12.895 --> 27:14.596
Although they've been
very liberal with us.

27:15.931 --> 27:17.833
But, you know,

27:17.900 --> 27:19.868
when we do things on the show,

27:19.935 --> 27:22.036
it's all very tasteful.

27:22.104 --> 27:23.705
Well, it's not real life.

27:26.641 --> 27:29.276
Why don't you let me
get the check?

27:29.344 --> 27:32.012
We go back to our pad,
smoke some grass,

27:32.080 --> 27:34.782
and... see
what happens.

27:34.850 --> 27:37.317
Sounds like fun.

27:37.386 --> 27:39.687
I don't know.
It's late.

27:39.755 --> 27:41.689
It's not.

27:41.757 --> 27:43.757
Look, if you don't
smoke grass, that's fine.

27:43.824 --> 27:46.659
It's not everything
we had in mind.

27:46.727 --> 27:48.428
I'm not sure if I understand.

27:50.297 --> 27:51.931
We like Megan.

27:51.999 --> 27:54.133
And we like <i>you.</i>

27:54.201 --> 27:56.770
And we'd like to be friends.

27:56.837 --> 27:58.570
Us, too.

28:01.508 --> 28:03.275
Well, then...

28:05.244 --> 28:08.013
I guess it's not impossible
under the right circumstances

28:08.080 --> 28:11.049
for us to become
better acquainted.

28:13.019 --> 28:16.554
Hey, it may not work.
It's a chemistry experiment.

28:16.622 --> 28:19.324
I have a big day tomorrow.
You both know that.

28:19.392 --> 28:21.960
That's work.
This is play.

28:22.028 --> 28:23.728
I have to get up very early.

28:23.796 --> 28:25.430
That's what
black coffee is for.

28:25.497 --> 28:27.198
I make it delicious.

28:27.266 --> 28:29.667
Uh...

28:29.735 --> 28:31.568
maybe another time.

28:31.636 --> 28:34.805
Arlene, we've heard
"no" before.

28:34.872 --> 28:37.107
I guess there's no reason
to skip dessert.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.180
What?

28:44.882 --> 28:46.850
This is the best seat.

28:46.918 --> 28:49.018
St. Marks between
2nd and 3rd, please.

28:52.089 --> 28:53.856
Have you been to
the Electric Circus?

28:53.924 --> 28:56.025
- All the time.
- We're from out of town.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.963
Let's see who kisses better.

29:01.832 --> 29:03.198
I'm not playing this game.

29:03.266 --> 29:04.599
Because she'll lose.

29:24.052 --> 29:26.153
What the hell was that?

29:26.221 --> 29:27.921
What? They like you
and they like me.

29:27.990 --> 29:30.024
They'd like us to be friends.

29:30.092 --> 29:32.426
They were so out in the open.

29:32.494 --> 29:34.828
It was a good strategy.
I kept thinking

29:34.896 --> 29:37.330
he was going to ask me for a
job directing commercials.

29:37.398 --> 29:39.399
Maybe he was waiting
for tomorrow morning

29:39.467 --> 29:41.701
- when we were basking in the afterglow.
- Don't.

29:41.768 --> 29:44.304
Just a pile of arms and legs.

29:44.372 --> 29:47.007
I don't know whether
to laugh or be sick

29:47.074 --> 29:49.109
because now I think

29:49.176 --> 29:51.110
that's the reason
they gave me the scene.

29:51.177 --> 29:52.511
I'm sure they've tried that

29:52.578 --> 29:54.480
with plenty of people
who haven't gotten scenes.

29:54.547 --> 29:58.417
Don, I have to go
back to work with them.

29:58.485 --> 30:01.387
It'll be better than ever.
How long have they been married?

30:01.454 --> 30:03.955
18 years.

30:19.771 --> 30:21.739
I'm busy.

30:21.806 --> 30:24.374
Come up for air.

30:24.442 --> 30:26.576
Oh, hey.

30:28.146 --> 30:29.446
Would you mind?

30:35.619 --> 30:37.521
This is my friend.

30:37.588 --> 30:39.922
I'm Johnny.

30:39.989 --> 30:42.724
Joan. Pleased to meet you.

30:42.792 --> 30:45.027
Johnny and Joan.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.996
Bonnie and Clyde.

30:49.933 --> 30:52.368
- Do you want a drink?
- I have one.

30:54.171 --> 30:57.004
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

30:59.542 --> 31:01.642
What'd I say?

31:03.912 --> 31:06.081
What did he say?

31:06.148 --> 31:08.683
He said I'd want you.

31:18.393 --> 31:21.128
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

31:23.164 --> 31:26.633
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

31:26.701 --> 31:29.034
Well, war or no war,

31:29.069 --> 31:31.804
Nixon doesn't think he's
running against Johnson.

31:31.871 --> 31:34.607
He thinks he's running against
the ghost of Kennedy.

31:34.674 --> 31:36.976
So does Johnson.

31:37.043 --> 31:39.178
I don't know where Helen is.

31:39.246 --> 31:40.513
How are you both this morning?

31:40.581 --> 31:43.082
Frankly, we're a little
embarrassed.

31:43.149 --> 31:46.684
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize.
That was not my intention.

31:46.752 --> 31:48.653
How are Jennifer,
Bea, and the twins?

31:48.721 --> 31:50.088
It's Nathan and Steven, right?

31:51.690 --> 31:53.725
Yes.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.260
They're well, thank you.

31:56.895 --> 31:58.930
That display
yesterday of--

31:58.998 --> 32:01.332
well, of initiative

32:01.399 --> 32:02.466
really caught our attention.

32:04.035 --> 32:08.005
This is a check for $23,500.

32:08.072 --> 32:10.574
That's the full commission
on "Broadway Joe."

32:10.642 --> 32:13.644
Well, thank you.

32:13.711 --> 32:16.045
That's a lot of money.

32:18.882 --> 32:21.651
So, anything else to say?

32:21.718 --> 32:25.087
I'm puzzled. What do you
make a year, Mr. Crane?

32:25.155 --> 32:27.422
22. So what about
the partnership?

32:27.490 --> 32:29.959
You want some of the spoils.
Well, there you go.

32:30.027 --> 32:31.994
We have to get bigger
before we get bigger.

32:32.062 --> 32:34.096
What a load of crap.

32:34.164 --> 32:36.265
- You know, Joan's not even in yet.
- Leave her out of this.

32:36.332 --> 32:38.133
Bert, you know
how important I am

32:38.200 --> 32:39.634
to this company.
You were me.

32:39.702 --> 32:43.938
I was different than you,
Mr. Crane, in every way.

32:45.841 --> 32:48.677
- So you don't want the money?
- No, I've earned the money.

32:48.744 --> 32:52.047
But I've also earned
a partnership.

32:52.114 --> 32:54.815
I really hope some other firm
doesn't figure that out first.

32:57.518 --> 33:00.688
That was the most
impressive thing he's done.

33:00.755 --> 33:02.723
Should we fire him
before he cashes that check?

33:09.865 --> 33:12.167
- Aren't you gonna be late?
- Aren't <i>you?</i>

33:19.874 --> 33:21.943
I love you.

33:22.010 --> 33:23.344
Wish me luck.

33:32.987 --> 33:34.720
Good luck.

33:48.668 --> 33:51.070
I'm really waking
you this time.

33:51.137 --> 33:53.172
Kate.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.440
Honey, wake up.

33:54.507 --> 33:56.875
Now you two layabouts
have to bathe him.

33:56.943 --> 33:58.243
I have an appointment.

33:58.311 --> 34:00.079
Mom, I'm still going to work.

34:00.146 --> 34:02.014
Do you need to throw up?

34:02.082 --> 34:04.082
Mother, can you
give us a minute?

34:11.889 --> 34:13.724
Why did I do that?

34:13.792 --> 34:16.360
You had some fun.

34:16.428 --> 34:18.896
I just wanted to try it.

34:18.964 --> 34:21.898
Now you'll go home and you'll find
everything right where it belongs.

34:23.234 --> 34:25.735
I'm really not you, am I?

34:27.237 --> 34:28.405
Why would you want to be?

34:28.473 --> 34:30.440
Are you kidding?

34:30.507 --> 34:33.409
Look what you did.

34:33.478 --> 34:35.478
You came out here,

34:35.545 --> 34:38.514
you staked this out
on your own.

34:38.581 --> 34:40.849
I always had Dennis
to fall back on.

34:40.917 --> 34:43.619
Even when I went to Mary Kay.

34:43.686 --> 34:45.554
You didn't.

34:47.157 --> 34:49.091
And I never will.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.927
How'd that happen?

34:52.995 --> 34:55.862
The whole reason
I even talked to Avon

34:55.931 --> 34:58.500
is because I wanted...

34:59.701 --> 35:02.003
I don't know,

35:02.071 --> 35:04.406
what you have.

35:04.473 --> 35:06.474
It's not what you think.

35:06.509 --> 35:07.742
You're an executive.

35:07.809 --> 35:09.543
It's a title.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.278
And money.

35:11.312 --> 35:13.980
I've been working there
for 15 years

35:14.015 --> 35:16.550
and they still treat
me like a secretary.

35:16.651 --> 35:18.919
What's it have to do with them?

35:19.020 --> 35:21.021
You're there, Joan.

35:21.089 --> 35:24.424
And from where I'm sitting,
it's damn impressive.

35:24.491 --> 35:26.292
I don't care
how they make you feel,

35:26.360 --> 35:28.561
it's right in front
of you for the taking.

35:35.169 --> 35:37.236
I'll be back in an hour.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.174
There you go.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.276
Oh.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.744
Okay, I'll draw the bath.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.216
It's clean, it's simple,

35:51.284 --> 35:53.885
and it's tantalizingly
incomplete.

35:53.953 --> 35:56.787
What's missing?
One thing.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.659
"Pass the Heinz."

36:02.727 --> 36:04.228
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.598
It's Heinz.
It only means one thing.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.999
It feels like half an ad.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.335
The greatest thing
you have working for you

36:12.403 --> 36:15.004
is not the photo you take
or the picture you paint.

36:15.072 --> 36:17.107
It's the imagination
of the consumer.

36:17.174 --> 36:20.510
They have no budget.
They have no time limit.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.512
And if you can get
into that space,

36:22.580 --> 36:25.047
your ad can run all day.

36:26.950 --> 36:29.251
Well, Pete,
you said I'd say it.

36:29.319 --> 36:31.086
<i>It's pretty bold work.</i>

36:31.154 --> 36:32.421
I think I still
want to see our bottle.

36:32.489 --> 36:34.523
I thought that
at first, too, but--

36:34.591 --> 36:37.659
We will test it both ways.

36:37.727 --> 36:39.328
It's a testament to ketchup

36:39.395 --> 36:42.030
that there can be no confusion.

36:42.098 --> 36:43.565
Let me chew on it, fellas.

36:49.904 --> 36:51.772
You're going to be thinking
of ketchup all day

36:51.840 --> 36:53.508
and you didn't even see it.

36:53.575 --> 36:55.543
Thank you.

36:55.611 --> 36:57.311
We'll be in touch.

37:05.486 --> 37:07.787
Well, hello.

37:07.855 --> 37:09.789
Hello.

37:19.432 --> 37:21.233
Ted, you want to come in?

37:23.303 --> 37:25.003
I hope you left us something.

37:26.139 --> 37:27.906
Good to see you.

37:32.678 --> 37:34.912
It's a bake-off?
Since when?

37:38.950 --> 37:40.685
- Come on, Don.
- Go wait by the elevator.

37:43.088 --> 37:44.755
Peggy.

37:46.758 --> 37:50.894
So, what's the difference
between ketchup and catsup?

37:50.961 --> 37:53.263
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,

37:53.331 --> 37:55.065
comes in a bigger bottle,

37:55.132 --> 37:57.434
is cheaper, but tastes
just like ketchup.

37:59.237 --> 38:01.104
Now, we know that's not true,

38:01.172 --> 38:03.039
but that's what
your competitors are saying.

38:03.107 --> 38:05.040
<i>Over and over.</i>

38:05.108 --> 38:09.312
And they're selling their
watered-down, flavorless sauce

38:09.379 --> 38:10.913
by pretending that they're you.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.682
<i>Makes you angry, doesn't it?</i>

38:13.750 --> 38:15.450
Me, too.

38:15.518 --> 38:18.320
But I always say

38:18.387 --> 38:20.288
if you don't like
what they're saying,

38:20.356 --> 38:21.824
change the conversation.

38:27.996 --> 38:31.432
"Heinz.
The only ketchup."

38:33.168 --> 38:35.937
Imagine this 40 feet tall

38:36.004 --> 38:37.404
in Times Square.

38:38.841 --> 38:41.642
Ketchup versus catsup--

38:41.710 --> 38:43.845
end of conversation.

38:52.153 --> 38:54.288
- Good morning.
- Good afternoon.

38:57.559 --> 38:59.226
Thank you.

39:11.238 --> 39:13.139
Joan, may I have a word?

39:26.586 --> 39:29.321
I'm sorry I was not
more forthright with you.

39:29.389 --> 39:32.290
I think it would only be
fair if you docked my pay

39:32.357 --> 39:34.425
to cover the hours
Scarlett did not work.

39:34.493 --> 39:36.794
Fair to whom?
Scarlett?

39:36.861 --> 39:39.764
I don't know.
Fair to the company?

39:46.971 --> 39:48.971
This is the key
to the supply closet

39:49.039 --> 39:51.508
and this is the key
to the time cards.

39:51.575 --> 39:54.577
You will be responsible
for monitoring both.

39:54.645 --> 39:56.078
What?

39:58.282 --> 40:00.116
Okay.

40:01.619 --> 40:04.020
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

40:04.087 --> 40:06.288
You don't understand
that this is punishment.

40:11.294 --> 40:13.395
Well, I don't care
if everybody hates me here

40:13.463 --> 40:15.297
as long as you don't.

40:15.365 --> 40:17.800
We'll see.

40:21.806 --> 40:23.772
So there's two of us.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.941
We're both
the same size agency.

40:26.009 --> 40:28.777
You're not afraid of
a little heads-up baseball.

40:28.845 --> 40:31.113
I only did it because no one
else was supposed to know.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.281
I think everything
should be done in secret.

40:33.349 --> 40:36.451
Lock me in that Project K room,
I'll work on anything, Don.

40:36.519 --> 40:38.754
I miss it already.

40:41.757 --> 40:44.058
Mind if we join
the Lonely Hearts Club?

40:45.260 --> 40:47.294
Who says we're not celebrating?

40:47.362 --> 40:50.131
J. Walter Thompson.
They bought it in the room.

40:50.198 --> 40:53.868
Are you kidding me?
We paid for that room.

40:53.936 --> 40:56.069
What do you know?

40:56.137 --> 40:58.672
The biggest agency
in the world.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.373
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

41:00.441 --> 41:03.309
See, I just got off
the phone with Raymond Geiger

41:03.377 --> 41:05.045
and he said that you
were at the Roosevelt

41:05.113 --> 41:07.080
giving a presentation
to the ketchup brand manager.

41:07.148 --> 41:09.683
But I said that was impossible
because how could that happen

41:09.751 --> 41:11.351
at my firm without me knowing?

41:11.418 --> 41:13.119
Because no one
was supposed to know.

41:14.955 --> 41:17.556
Let me get a rye rocks
and an Old Spanish.

41:17.624 --> 41:19.591
I'm sorry, Ken.
Damn it.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.193
I'll call him.
I'll work it out.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.795
Don't bother.

41:22.863 --> 41:25.497
He doesn't even want
to give us 90 days.

41:25.565 --> 41:26.999
There's nothing better than
being known for your loyalty.

41:34.574 --> 41:36.575
You hear that, Ted?

41:36.643 --> 41:39.077
Vinegars, sauces,
and beans is available.

41:39.145 --> 41:40.979
Help yourself.
It's a gold mine.

41:41.047 --> 41:42.947
<i>They'd love that.</i>

41:43.015 --> 41:45.883
There's a pie and they
slice it into pieces

41:45.950 --> 41:48.052
and they throw the tiniest
piece into the yard

41:48.119 --> 41:50.120
and let all the small
agencies fight over it.

41:50.189 --> 41:52.290
Speak for yourself.

41:56.361 --> 41:58.095
It was worth the risk.

42:01.699 --> 42:03.099
I think I see a friend.

42:13.777 --> 42:16.579
Please, Rafe,
you have a family.

42:16.646 --> 42:18.314
I have a family
that ignores me,

42:18.381 --> 42:20.482
that treats me like
I've never been there.

42:20.550 --> 42:24.019
But you, you make me
feel new again.

42:24.087 --> 42:26.154
I work for you.

42:26.223 --> 42:28.090
And for her.

42:29.426 --> 42:30.759
She's good to me.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.560
Stop fighting.

42:32.628 --> 42:33.861
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

42:35.397 --> 42:36.964
This is your bed
you share with her.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.366
I can't.

42:47.142 --> 42:49.343
Rafe, we can't.

42:49.410 --> 42:52.412
<i>Corinne, don't deny this,</i>
<i>what's between us.</i>

42:52.480 --> 42:55.115
<i>Don't deny me when</i>
<i>I know you feel it too.</i>

42:55.182 --> 42:57.284
I do.

43:02.223 --> 43:05.124
Rafe.

43:05.191 --> 43:07.560
You like to watch, do you?

43:07.628 --> 43:10.829
<i>Oh, Rafe.</i>

43:10.897 --> 43:12.398
<i>And we're clear.</i>

43:12.466 --> 43:15.534
<i>Everyone to</i>
<i>the conservatory set.</i>

43:15.602 --> 43:17.670
- <i>Very nice, everyone.</i>
- You did great.

43:17.738 --> 43:19.672
Thank you.

43:23.075 --> 43:25.209
Megan, your agent's here.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.520
That was steamy.

43:38.123 --> 43:41.425
So I should go change
and we can go.

43:41.493 --> 43:42.893
I'll keep you company.

43:53.737 --> 43:55.438
What are you doing here?

43:55.506 --> 43:57.307
Because you didn't
want me to see that?

43:57.374 --> 44:00.409
No, and I don't understand why
you'd do that to yourself.

44:00.476 --> 44:03.045
It's a hell of a lot better than
letting my imagination run wild.

44:05.782 --> 44:08.017
The first time you come
to set is for this?

44:08.084 --> 44:10.652
I've been here for months. What did
you think was going to happen?

44:10.720 --> 44:12.021
I didn't expect you
to enjoy it.

44:12.088 --> 44:13.655
It's acting, Don.

44:13.723 --> 44:16.124
Were you gonna brush your teeth
at least before you came home?

44:16.192 --> 44:19.427
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every
time something good happens to me.

44:19.494 --> 44:21.729
This is my job.
No, my career.

44:21.797 --> 44:25.066
You kiss people for money.
You know who does that?

44:25.134 --> 44:28.669
You couldn't stop it, so I guess
ruining it was enough for you.

44:28.737 --> 44:30.571
Would you rather
have not known?

44:30.639 --> 44:33.040
You never watch the show. It'd
be like it never happened.

44:33.107 --> 44:35.742
Why don't you have dinner
with Arlene and Mel tonight?

44:35.810 --> 44:37.610
They're much more
open-minded.

45:07.806 --> 45:09.440
That's been out there all day.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.113
Was it going to be
out there all night?

45:15.181 --> 45:17.415
Yes.

45:36.133 --> 45:38.868
- Take that off.
- Why?

45:38.936 --> 45:40.603
It doesn't mean
anything to you.

45:40.670 --> 45:42.138
It does to you.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.973
It does.

45:44.041 --> 45:48.111
So what do you do
when I leave here?

45:48.178 --> 45:50.446
Get on your knees
and pray for absolution?

45:53.849 --> 45:56.751
I pray for you.

45:56.819 --> 45:58.520
For me to come back?

45:58.587 --> 46:00.722
No.

46:04.093 --> 46:06.761
For you to find peace.
