00:09.259 --> 00:11.386
-Anything?
-DIANA: <i>Nothing.</i>

00:12.971 --> 00:15.140
It's 20 after. You want to call it?

00:15.224 --> 00:16.767
No, not yet.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.228
Fowler was willing to pull a gun on you

00:19.311 --> 00:21.438
to make sure we didn't know
about this meeting.

00:22.397 --> 00:26.693
<i>Whoever shows up, I'm betting they know</i>
<i>why that plane exploded.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:27.778

-PETER: <i>Diana, you see him?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:32.908
<i>Can't make a face.</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:38.747
Excuse me. FBI.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.250
Hold it right there.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.378
He's heading around the stone arches.
Cut him off!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.181
DIANA: FBI. Freeze!

01:08.110 --> 01:10.487
He knows how to slip a tail.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.239
Yeah. This guy's no civilian.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.702
All right, I want you to pull tape
from every surveillance camera in the area

01:16.785 --> 01:19.204
plus our cameras, ATM cameras.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.665
-Everything in this area.
-Yeah.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.625
I want to know who this guy is.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.680
Morning.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.348
You look exhausted.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.851
Oh, I don't sleep well
when Elizabeth's out of town.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.520
Well, if her company keeps
taking off the way it is

01:43.604 --> 01:46.023
you can retire early
and become a house husband.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.775
Because when you look at me,
you see soap operas and light housework.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.570
-What are we watching?
-Our new case.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.530
Potentially corrupt politician.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.908
-Need a moment to recover?
-I might, actually.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.826
NEAL: Gary Jennings, state senator.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.245
-You've heard of him?
-I am politically aware.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.372
He's popular. Even Mozzie voted for him.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.834
-Mozzie votes?
-More often than you'd think.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.336
Or would approve of.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.546
REPORTER: <i>Why did you</i>
<i>get into politics, Mr. Jennings?</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:13.050
<i>Well, I… You know, I didn't plan to.</i>
<i>I wanted to be a carpenter.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:15.886
-Jesus was a carpenter.
-Yeah, he's subtle.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.181
<i>But then I… I realized</i>
<i>that my talents</i><i>were better suited</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:20.807
<i>to helping build America's future</i>

02:20.891 --> 02:23.143

<i>rather than brick and mortar.</i>

02:23.227 --> 02:25.270
<i>That's where I find my inspiration.</i>

02:25.354 --> 02:27.856
-(INAUDIBLE)
-Well, his assistant

02:27.940 --> 02:30.984
thinks that he's illegally funneling money
into his campaign.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.236
Don't tell Mozzie.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.987
We've had our eye on Jennings for a while.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.823
So far nothing's stuck,
but this could be our in.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.537
-You want to join a political campaign?
-What do I have to do?

02:41.620 --> 02:43.288
Let's figure that out.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.707
I was a true believer.
I believed in Jennings.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.751
I still believe in what he stands for.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.253
What changed your mind?

02:49.336 --> 02:52.381
Gary started having
these mystery meetings.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.718
Right after, our campaign started getting
an increasing number of donations.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.887
Gary started keeping two sets of books.

02:58.971 --> 03:02.516
I'm in charge of one, none of the
regular staff sees the other one.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.393
What do you think is inside that book?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.522
I think he set up a straw donor scam.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.149
It's an end run
around campaign funding rules

03:11.233 --> 03:12.901
that limit donations from individuals.

03:12.985 --> 03:16.154
Oh, I know what it is.
Politicians were the original conmen.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.657
Instead of cutting
one big check to himself

03:18.740 --> 03:20.075
from a questionable source,

03:20.158 --> 03:22.369
Jennings gets regular people
to write him smaller checks.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.830
Then reimburses them under the table
for their contributions.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.749
I think the second book
has a list of the straw donors

03:27.833 --> 03:29.668
and the source of the illegal money.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.837
-Well, who has access?
-His inner circle.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.965
Reggie, our head of opposition research,
maybe a few others.

03:35.048 --> 03:39.052
We have to find a way
to get you inside Jennings' inner circle.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.144
NEAL: I got it.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.730
-Bad cop, good criminal.
-No such thing.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.608
Listen. It's a variation
on a con that I…

03:52.691 --> 03:54.234
thought about running before.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.821
The bad guy, the cop, that's you,
creates a problem for Jennings.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.281
-And the good guy…
-That's you?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.033
-Right. I provide the solution.
-Oh.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.744
Listen, if I make Jennings
think that the FBI's on to him,

04:03.827 --> 04:05.412
it will spook him. He'll burn his books.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.664
Not if he thinks Bureau's
barking up the wrong tree.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.167
Here's an old loan scandal
he was wrapped up in.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.336
Yeah. He walked away clean
from that years ago.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.131
But it might make him worried
if he thinks that the digging around…

04:16.215 --> 04:18.634
Could uncover whatever he's really doing.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.844
And make him nervous enough
to hire a fixer.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.472
Who does he normally use
to cover up his problems?

04:23.555 --> 04:25.682
Jennings' usual guy quit a few months ago,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.101
the same time he started
his mystery meetings.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.437
-This could work.
-All we need's a bad cop.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.732
-I can do bad cop.
-I've seen you do mildly irritated cop.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.068
Wow.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.199
I hate these glad-handing events.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.910
You picked the wrong job
if you don't want to shake hands.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.204
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-What?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.791
-Sorry to interrupt, sir.
-Dylan, I said no more appointments.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.043
Peter Burke, FBI.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.507
Well, what can I do for you, Agent Burke?

04:58.590 --> 05:01.844
-I came to say thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.763
-What did I do?
-Nothing yet.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.140
But I'm gonna make
my career taking you down.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.894
I'm sorry. Um…

05:10.978 --> 05:13.397
Am I actually being accused of something?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.649
The Michelson loan scandal.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.152
The FBI looked into that scandal
years ago. They found nothing.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.072
You really want to waste taxpayers' money
with another witch hunt?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.407
I do.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.494
I know if I start kicking over rocks,
something will crawl out.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.456
And when it does,
it's gonna get your name, my name,

05:31.540 --> 05:34.543
and the word "scandal"
on the same headline.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.670
And then you figure
you can have any job you want?

05:36.753 --> 05:40.174
Yeah. Maybe I'll take this office.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.842
Why me?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.761
Because I can tell you're dirty
just by looking at you.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.185
So I'll keep digging
until I find something that will bury you.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.645
You've got my word on that.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.865
-How did I do?
-Nice acting.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.992
-Who said I was acting?

-Yep. Whatever you said,

-Jennings is freaked out.

Oh, you do it in pen. I'm impressed.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.956
I'm looking for inspiration, you know?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.334
And I think I just found it.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.087
What was the fallout
from your meeting with Jennings?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.965
He called in some favors,
tried to get me fired.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.260
Hughes is protecting me, which should
frustrate Jennings even further.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.344
Excellent.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.515
According to Dylan,
he's looking for a new fixer as we speak.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.600
I didn't doubt you for a second.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.060
Dylan put your name on the list,

07:15.143 --> 07:18.063
but Jennings is still looking
at other people too.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.232
So we need to make sure you get that job.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.150
Well, I don't have an alias
with this type of background.

07:22.234 --> 07:26.154
Hmm. You're about to get one,
courtesy of the FBI.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.367
What do you need to know
about creating a background?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.245
Nothing. We're the FBI.
You're good but we're better.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.748
-You're now Benjamin Cooper.
-Wow, high school yearbook.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.375
-You're definitely thorough.
-PETER: They're thorough.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.752
Jennings doesn't mess around
with this stuff.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.462
That means no anklet when you're with him.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.549
-Yeah. Nice Photoshop work.
-We'll add the yearbook

07:45.632 --> 07:47.176

-You weren't valedictorian?
-You have to graduate for that.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.391
DIANA: We're giving you
a 4.0 from Harvard Law.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.934
Harvard is so pedestrian.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.145
Don't let Jones hear you say that.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.815
After graduating, you did a stint at
the firm Brextan and Miller in Delaware.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.734
Very exclusive and Grisham-esque.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.737
This is perfect.

-Benjamin Cooper?
-That would be me.

Thank you so much.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.013
Well, if you called me,

08:33.722 --> 08:35.724
means you've got a problem
on your hands, right?

08:37.559 --> 08:40.103
We've got a fed on steroids
who's going after Gary

08:40.187 --> 08:41.855
-about the Michelson…
-Details don't matter.

08:41.939 --> 08:45.484
-Oh, I think they do. This FBI agent is…
-Don't worry about the agent.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.152
Your constituents
aren't going to care about him.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.529
Why won't they?

08:48.612 --> 08:52.115
Because they'll be far more concerned
with your position on the new stadium.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.245
What's he talking about?
Do you know anything about a new stadium?

08:56.328 --> 08:57.371
No, nothing.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.832
-What new stadium?
-That's exactly what you're gonna say.

09:00.916 --> 09:01.917
"What new stadium?"

09:02.000 --> 09:04.336
And when the reporter asks
what you're talking about,

09:04.419 --> 09:06.630
deny you're in any way involved
with the talks to build it.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.299
-There isn't going to be a new stadium.
-Now you're getting it.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.094
Look, if there were
a new stadium being built,

09:12.177 --> 09:13.595
which there isn't, why would I oppose it?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.264
-Oh, you don't oppose it.
-I don't?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.015
Course not. You just don't want them

09:17.099 --> 09:18.976
building the stadium
in that particular location,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.727
because that's where
you want them to build

09:20.811 --> 09:22.062
the new children's park.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.524
-May I, uh…
-Yeah.

09:26.692 --> 09:27.693
There we go.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.995
We're talking to several people
about this job…

09:38.078 --> 09:39.246
All right.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.416
Go on.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.710
-Are you following any of this?
-Nope.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.838
That's the point.
It's all a giant distraction.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.507
Who's gonna care about
an old loan scandal of yours

09:50.591 --> 09:52.217
when you're fighting against the system?

09:52.301 --> 09:55.304
Against the corporate fat cats
who think overpaid athletes

09:55.387 --> 09:57.639
are more important
than our city's children.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.391
But the story won't hold up.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.435
You've got less than a month
before the election.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.521
It doesn't have to hold up.
We just have to distract, right?

10:06.023 --> 10:08.233
You've got a problem.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.776
I'm your solution, Senator.

-You don't get to "shh" me.
-Oh, okay.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.301
Next time I'll let Jennings
hear your voice in the background.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.846
-You're hired?
-Like I said, bad cop, good cop.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.932
-Good criminal.
-Consultant.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.475
Mmm.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.268
So the stadium thing worked, huh?

10:43.352 --> 10:45.437
In today's world, rumor is truth.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.106
But you told him to deny
that there were any talks.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.317
Exactly. Which means there must be talks.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.194
This is why I hate politics.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.532
Oh, uh, Elizabeth's still out of town,
right? You wanna grab a drink?

10:56.615 --> 11:00.160
Can't. Uh, I owe Captain Shadduck a favor.

-Oh, it's just you and Satchmo tonight?
-Yeah, just the dog and me.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.573
-Elizabeth's still in San Francisco?
-She is. Can I get you a beer?

11:37.656 --> 11:38.949
-Sure.
-All right.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.706
So how was your dinner with Chrissy?

11:45.789 --> 11:46.790
Hmm.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.335
Oh, she's still having a tough time
adjusting to New York?

11:50.419 --> 11:52.045
-We'll get through it.
-Hmm.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.922
Yeah, you will. You will.

11:54.006 --> 11:57.050
All right. Any luck
putting a face on our mystery man?

11:57.134 --> 11:59.136
He was good. He avoided our cameras

11:59.219 --> 12:00.888
and the surveillance cameras
on the street.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.264
PETER: Hmm.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.102
Ooh. Just bits and pieces of a face.

12:07.186 --> 12:10.272
Well, put the pieces together
and we get this.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.151

in a horror movie.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.277
Heh. Our patchwork man.

I'm running it through the facial
recognition database discreetly.

-What about the location of the music box?

12:21.825 --> 12:22.993
Anybody poking around?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.495
Couple of feelers,
but no one knows where it is.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.373
-Except you?
-Just like you asked, boss.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.584
Are you sure you don't wanna know
where I'm keeping it?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.587
Oh, it's safer
for the both of us if I don't.

you want to keep all this from him?

with any sort of false hope.

-Good.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.518

Well, the, uh, the door's locked,

13:31.812 --> 13:34.273
and Jennings and Reggie
are the only ones with keys

13:34.356 --> 13:35.649
but they'll be here any minute.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.693
So distract them.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.112
-Can you do that?
-Um…

13:40.195 --> 13:41.864
-I'm a terrible liar.
-Good.

I was gonna go grab a smoke
before we jump in. Do you have a light?

-Smoking makes you look weak.
-I'll remember that.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.913
Oh, uh, we should discuss my fee.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.541
Now, I was hoping
we could do it off the books.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.335
I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.

The symbol is the flower of Aphrodite.
Ran it through the ACS database.

15:43.402 --> 15:47.239
It came up with two coffee shops,
a bakery, a winery,

We may have found a solution
to our problem with our FBI agent.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.270
That's not Mrs. Burke.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.523
-When were these taken?
-Last night.

18:26.607 --> 18:29.109
If Burke's having an affair,
we can use that.

-We know who the girl is yet?
-Not yet.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.988

-How do you figure?
-This Burke is an FBI guy.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.498
He's a control freak.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.251
He's not gonna have an affair.
It's too sloppy.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.295
He may be right.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.925
We can use her.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.302
These pictures aren't enough
to take Burke out.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.304
But if we can get her
to meet with him again

18:57.387 --> 18:59.097
and she's under our thumb…

19:02.559 --> 19:05.229
We might have someone
who can help us with that.

You told them Diana was a hooker?

-I hope that's true.

-I've never lied to you.
-Oh, come on, Neal.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.669
-You lie for a living.
-Not to you.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.587
I may have let you draw
certain conclusions

19:30.671 --> 19:32.756
that weren't correct
but never an actual lie.

19:38.762 --> 19:43.267
All right. So one of Jennings' guys
was standing in my backyard taking these.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.645
Yeah, you got to them.
They think you're having an affair.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.439
Took a risk and told them
Diana was a prostitute,

19:49.523 --> 19:50.691
and they took the bait.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.735
Told me to find her and put her in touch
with a guy they know named Barrow.

19:53.819 --> 19:58.031
Ah, your mystery man Jennings called
to get you paid off the books.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.617
-Mmm.
-So maybe the Aphrodite Escort Service

20:00.701 --> 20:02.870
is where the cash is coming from
to pay the straw donors.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.831
That's what I think. Can you set Diana up
with an alias as good as mine?

20:05.914 --> 20:08.083
As an escort? Sure.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.086
Diana. Can you come here a minute?

20:11.170 --> 20:13.172
-You gonna tell her?
-I'm not telling her.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.883
-You're the one who made her a hooker.
-You're the one who's sleeping with her.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.426
-You got a point.
-Yeah?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.804
Neal told Jennings you're a hooker.
You and I are having an affair.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.222
You're gonna go meet
with an escort service.

20:22.306 --> 20:25.100
-Okay, anything else?
-No.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.727
(EXHALES)

20:26.810 --> 20:28.353
It's good to have her back.

about the pictures?

20:32.524 --> 20:35.444
Yeah, I did.
He said it was a misunderstanding.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.821
Oh, right. So was the Bay of Pigs.

20:37.905 --> 20:41.950
So you think he's looking
into who killed Kate in his off hours?

20:42.034 --> 20:43.702
I suppose that's a good thing.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.913
I want to know what he's found.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.456
He's trying to protect you.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.291
Oh, come on, Moz, I don't need protecting.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.586
It's only fair. We keep secrets
from the suits all the time.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.546
Now they have their own.

There's a letter campaign?

in the world around you.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.856
Yeah.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.359

21:16.401 --> 21:18.570

23:09.431 --> 23:11.099
Ten thousand in cash.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.481
Guys, I was not prepared for an audition.

23:17.564 --> 23:21.235
I'm either walking out of here
or taking some guy up to the penthouse.

23:22.778 --> 23:23.987
So, what's the plan?

23:25.864 --> 23:27.366
Where'd Caffrey go?

23:30.911 --> 23:33.413
(CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

23:40.420 --> 23:41.964

All right, let's make the best of this.
We have three hours.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.265
If we can get $10,000,

23:51.348 --> 23:54.059
we can follow the money trail,
see if it leads back to Jennings.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.687
Peter, we can't get a cash request
out of the Bureau that fast.

Peter, if you're wondering
where to get $10,000

24:13.412 --> 24:15.664

-You've come to the right place.
-Cut the crap, Mozzie.

24:31.263 --> 24:33.140
Can you get us the ten grand or not?

24:33.223 --> 24:35.100
Yes. But first, some ground rules.

24:35.184 --> 24:38.395
I want full immunity about anything
you may see or hear tonight.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.938
Let's just say I'll owe you one.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.402
I accept your counter offer.
I need your shoelace.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.530
My shoelaces are gonna get us the $10,000?

24:48.614 --> 24:50.949
Rule number two, no further questions.

24:54.203 --> 24:58.290
I'm doing this more out
of a morbid curiosity than anything else.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.043
I'll also need a magnet
and a <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

taken him up to my room,

27:02.581 --> 27:04.374

<i>for their own profit</i>

36:46.123 --> 36:49.251

<i>of this city have a place to play.</i>

36:49.334 --> 36:50.627
<i>Well, I'll tell you this.</i>

36:50.711 --> 36:52.171
<i>They can come at me</i>
<i>with whatever they want,</i>

36:52.254 --> 36:54.089

36:55.674 --> 36:58.427
-(CROWD APPLAUDING)
-All right. Yeah.

37:02.264 --> 37:04.600
Good work.
Good job on Timmy Nolan, my friend.

37:04.683 --> 37:05.767
Cooper.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.313
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

37:11.356 --> 37:13.859
-Thanks, I'll check in later.
-Nice job.

37:13.942 --> 37:16.570
Look, I need to know what's going on,
or I can't fix it.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.657
-If you can't trust me…
-You believe in Gary Jennings, right?

37:20.741 --> 37:22.868
Yeah. I wouldn't have
done this if I didn't.

37:22.951 --> 37:24.578
He's gonna be governor
in the next five years.

37:24.661 --> 37:27.122
He's got his sights set even higher.

37:27.206 --> 37:31.210
To make it there,
we need to take out this FBI agent.

37:33.045 --> 37:36.965
Didn't you just watch the news?
This story's buried. I took care of it.

37:37.049 --> 37:40.010
For now, yeah.
But I've seen guys like Burke.

37:40.719 --> 37:43.472
You buried him now.
But that's just gonna heat him up.

37:44.723 --> 37:45.849
What's your plan?

37:46.600 --> 37:49.269
This prostitute, Lana…

37:49.353 --> 37:52.064
I think she knows a lot more
about Burke than she's letting on.

37:52.147 --> 37:55.442
-You want to talk to her?
-Not me. I've got a guy.

37:55.526 --> 37:57.861
-Barrow?
-Yeah. He'll get it out of her.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.655
What's he gonna do to the girl?

37:59.738 --> 38:01.031
He'll scare her.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.699
-Maybe rough her up a little.
-Uh-huh.

38:03.367 --> 38:06.119
-And what if he gets out of control?
-Is that so bad?

38:07.412 --> 38:11.458
When's Barrow gonna have
this discussion with the girl?

38:11.542 --> 38:13.001
Any time now.

38:20.217 --> 38:21.426
Here we go.

38:22.052 --> 38:24.304
Diana's entering Barrow's hotel room.

38:24.388 --> 38:26.223
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

38:29.643 --> 38:33.355
Diana's in trouble. You two come with me.
Jones, call for backup.

38:33.438 --> 38:34.982
Move away from the door.

38:36.441 --> 38:37.943
What's going on?

38:38.026 --> 38:39.987
Just sit down and you won't get hurt.

38:40.654 --> 38:41.989
I promise.

38:42.072 --> 38:44.616
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.285
We're just gonna have a chat.

38:46.368 --> 38:49.413
You should know you're threatening
an undercover FBI agent.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.623
That's even more reason
for me to pull the trigger.

38:51.707 --> 38:54.001
Put the gun down
and you'll walk out of here.

38:54.084 --> 38:55.460
Really?

38:55.544 --> 38:57.087
Really.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.382
Draw and I'll put a bullet
through your shoulder.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.518
-(GUNSHOT)
-(YELLS)

39:12.644 --> 39:13.645
(GRUNTING)

39:19.818 --> 39:21.904
-Told you.
-(DOOR CRASHES)

39:24.823 --> 39:27.117
Aw. You were worried.

39:27.201 --> 39:29.703
Well, not about you.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.747
I was worried what you'd do to him.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.916
Think we've got enough
to arrest Jennings now.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.584
Yeah.

39:35.667 --> 39:36.960
I think we do.

39:42.049 --> 39:44.927
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

39:50.057 --> 39:53.143
-You get what you need?
-Barrow rolled on Jennings.

39:53.227 --> 39:56.188
He figured a confession
was better for the soul.

39:56.813 --> 39:59.066
Jones just finished arresting Reggie.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.110
And he found a copy
of the second set of books on him.

40:02.194 --> 40:04.363
-Now for the big guy.
-Oh, wait for it.

40:05.822 --> 40:07.282
NEAL: Yeah. (LAUGHING)

40:07.783 --> 40:09.368
Picture perfect.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.387
Ah, I don't think
this is the kind of headline

40:28.470 --> 40:29.763
you're looking for, Agent Burke.

40:29.847 --> 40:32.683
"Rogue FBI agent arrests innocent man."

40:32.766 --> 40:35.894
(CHUCKLES) You're a saint. Isn't he?

40:35.978 --> 40:40.023
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I can almost see the halo. Yeah.

40:40.107 --> 40:43.485
Hey, what do you think? Uh…
Hang the dogs playing poker on that wall?

40:43.569 --> 40:45.028
That would really bring
this room together.

40:45.112 --> 40:47.281
Senator Jennings, you're under arrest.

40:47.364 --> 40:49.116
This is ridiculous. On what charge?

40:49.199 --> 40:50.576
Oh, a bunch of them.

40:50.659 --> 40:54.121
Campaign finance fraud
and as an accessory to murder.

40:54.204 --> 40:57.124
-He also knows about Barrow.
-I also know about Barrow.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.877
Nothing to say to that?

41:00.377 --> 41:01.795
I want my lawyer.

41:02.629 --> 41:03.964
Good choice.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.591
(WINCES)

41:09.928 --> 41:11.346
-Oh, Peter.
-Hmm?

41:13.265 --> 41:16.768
<i>A new bond measure has been placed</i>

41:28.697 --> 41:30.949
<i>and an old-fashioned game of stickball.</i>

41:32.284 --> 41:34.620
Look at you. You got a park built.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.384
Peter, how could you keep this from me?

41:50.928 --> 41:53.263
I'm sorry, boss. He needed to know.

41:54.097 --> 41:56.767
-Neal…
-I expected more <i>Magnum, P.I.</i>

41:57.935 --> 41:59.478
And less <i>Super Mario.</i>

41:59.561 --> 42:01.271
-I burned all of those.
-(LAUGHING)

42:01.355 --> 42:02.773
-How did… Give me that.
-No, no.

42:02.856 --> 42:04.358
-Come on.
-It's more Burt Reynolds, no?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.610
-I'm gonna take a poll.
-No, you're not gonna take a poll.

42:06.693 --> 42:07.903
NEAL: (IMITATING MARIO) I'm Mario.

42:07.986 --> 42:10.072
Oh, that's funny. You look good in orange.

42:10.155 --> 42:11.323
(DIANA LAUGHS)

42:11.406 --> 42:12.950
That's for making me flirt with Caffrey.

42:13.033 --> 42:15.118
All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.

42:15.202 --> 42:18.038
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Free. Who wants it?
Who wants it? Take it, you guys.

-And?
-Nothing on our mystery man.
