00:00.344 --> 00:02.000
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.033 --> 00:03.987
[Judge] I'd like Callie to spend
one day a week with her father.

00:04.107 --> 00:06.430
I will see Robert, but
I won't see anyone else.

00:06.458 --> 00:08.210
<i>[Callie] There's nothing you can
say that will make me forgive you.</i>

00:08.229 --> 00:10.917
If you don't forgive me, I'll kill myself.

00:10.937 --> 00:12.178
<i>[Daphne] I've done
everything I'm supposed to,</i>

00:12.194 --> 00:13.431
they still won't give me visitation.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.380
Take this with you

00:14.436 --> 00:16.563
- and you go up to the door and you knock.
- [Tasha whimpering]

00:16.683 --> 00:18.315
[Jude] That's a little over my budget.

00:18.335 --> 00:20.650
This bracelet just went
on sale. Sixty percent off.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.144
Why don't you just move
in until the baby's born?

00:23.196 --> 00:24.614
<i>[Mariana] You didn't
tell me Ana's pregnant.</i>

00:24.626 --> 00:25.499
Mom told me not to.

00:25.534 --> 00:27.347
She can't take care of a baby, Mom.

00:27.502 --> 00:28.571
Even with Mike's help.

00:28.597 --> 00:30.291
I can't believe you told your mom... again.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.499
I can't be friends with a little bitch

00:31.502 --> 00:33.129
that tells his mom every
time something happens.

00:33.574 --> 00:37.562
Idyllwild would like to offer you a
full ride to their summer music program.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.945
It's not gonna be some kind of
crazy, drug-fueled, you know,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.417
trashing hotels kind of tour.

00:42.537 --> 00:45.746
We'll set aside enough money to
make sure we're staying in motels.

00:45.894 --> 00:48.853
Oh, my God. That is huge.
Why would you do this?!

00:49.005 --> 00:49.860
'Cause I wanted to show Hayley

00:49.860 --> 00:50.946
- how much I liked her.
- [scoffs]

00:52.147 --> 00:53.035
[man] Hayley, huh?

00:53.188 --> 00:54.336
Sounds like a real heartbreaker.

00:54.915 --> 00:55.871
Can it be removed?

00:56.167 --> 00:57.586
Well, luckily it's just black ink.

00:57.598 --> 00:59.405
- That's the easiest to break down.
- Break down?

00:59.626 --> 01:02.535
We zap it with a laser and the
body eventually absorbs the ink.

01:02.547 --> 01:03.470
Does the zap hurt?

01:03.846 --> 01:04.846
Did it hurt when you got it?

01:04.881 --> 01:05.616
Hell, yeah.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.849
Unfortunately, it hurts
more to get rid of it.

01:07.969 --> 01:10.305
Feels like the snap of a hot
rubber band against your skin.

01:10.425 --> 01:12.368
- How long does it take?
- Five minutes.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.998
- [Jesus] That's not bad.
- Per session.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.173
I'm guessing you're looking at about ten.

01:16.454 --> 01:17.518
- Ten?
- Minimum.

01:17.553 --> 01:19.194
With seven weeks healing time in between.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.277
Seven weeks to heal?

01:20.312 --> 01:22.660
Is there scarring or risk of infection?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.313
Not if he follows all
the care instructions.

01:24.508 --> 01:26.085
- Should we get started today?
- Today?

01:26.205 --> 01:27.391
[Lena] Sure, why not?

01:27.447 --> 01:29.006
Please, Mom. Do I have to do this?

01:29.028 --> 01:31.307
Do you want Hayley's name on your
body for the rest of your life?

01:31.337 --> 01:33.992
No. Can't I just, like,
cover it with a dragon?

01:34.631 --> 01:36.728
Everything you do has consequences, Jesus.

01:36.749 --> 01:38.701
I'm sorry that this one has to be painful.

01:38.821 --> 01:41.084
Now is the time I need
you to put on the glasses.

01:44.541 --> 01:46.159
If you'll just lie back.

01:46.435 --> 01:48.115
I need you to roll over onto your side.

01:49.955 --> 01:50.955
All right.

01:51.485 --> 01:52.670
Just try and relax.

01:52.683 --> 01:55.263
- Here we go.
- [electricity zapping]

01:55.603 --> 01:58.149
- [groaning]
- [doctor] I know, right?

01:59.020 --> 02:00.130
[groans]

02:00.165 --> 02:03.113
- Is it gone yet?
- No, it takes months.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.457
- And it's torture.
- Sounds like your relationship with Hayley.

02:05.517 --> 02:08.038
Yeah, but the tattoo will last longer.

02:08.072 --> 02:10.122
You know, if you add a few extra letters

02:10.136 --> 02:12.484
you could turn it into "Epic Fail... y."

02:12.518 --> 02:14.086
Ha-ha, very funny. I get it.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.308
- OK? I'm an idiot.
- [Stef] You're not an idiot.

02:16.364 --> 02:18.394
- [Jesus] That's what everyone thinks.
- That's not true.

02:18.433 --> 02:19.816
Everyone stop teasing him.

02:19.851 --> 02:21.604
Yeah, before we go around this

02:21.824 --> 02:25.115
table and call you out on all
the mistakes you guys have made.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.890
So, uh, any idea

02:28.010 --> 02:30.307
when you guys might decide if
I can go on tour this summer?

02:31.062 --> 02:33.082
Just the band really needs to know.

02:33.202 --> 02:35.647
Yes, we have actually decided.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.169
We've discussed it at great
length with your father

02:39.289 --> 02:41.246
and we all agree

02:42.375 --> 02:43.612
that you can go.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.059
What? I can?

02:47.770 --> 02:48.873
Are you insane?!

02:48.911 --> 02:50.529
After all the dumb stuff he's done?

02:50.553 --> 02:51.919
He sold fake IDs at school!

02:51.950 --> 02:53.587
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

02:53.638 --> 02:56.223
You really think that you can
trust him to spend all summer

02:56.271 --> 02:59.295
driving around in a van with a bunch
of kids playing dive bars and raves?

02:59.330 --> 03:01.152
There's not gonna be any raves.

03:01.272 --> 03:02.587
What's with the sabotage?

03:02.617 --> 03:05.706
Listen, we are well aware of the
potential for misadventure here.

03:05.749 --> 03:08.834

03:59.790 --> 04:01.841
you know, that we'll be checking in

04:02.056 --> 04:03.812
a couple times a day.

And, uh, you know, that we have a plan.

- [scoffs] We're not going on a cruise.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.837

on gigs that might come up.

It's more of like an
overall, kind of general idea.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.124
Uh, and there's another thing.

04:20.141 --> 04:22.548
They want us to stay in motels.

04:23.324 --> 04:24.405
But I did the math,

04:24.435 --> 04:28.339
and, you know, if we all stay in one
room at one of those $99-a-night places,

04:28.377 --> 04:31.704
- then it's only $25 bucks each.
- Times 20 nights.

No way.

04:55.956 --> 04:57.141
It's my bandage.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.138

Hey, look, I just don't think that he
should be out on the road all summer.

You don't think Mat should
be out on the road all summer.

- Shut up.

And stop leaving your
hazardous waste around.

It's disgusting and rude.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.929
You narc'ed to Moms about my tattoo.

05:15.955 --> 05:18.398
Because I had to hear
about Ana from Epic Fail-y.

05:18.437 --> 05:20.152
Because you freaked the hell
out any time I mention her.

05:20.177 --> 05:21.517
Will you please throw that away?

05:22.237 --> 05:23.577
And I'm done freaking out about Ana

05:23.611 --> 05:25.546
because I'm never having
a relationship with her.

05:25.666 --> 05:26.653
What about her baby?

05:27.489 --> 05:29.591
It's gonna be our brother or our sister.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.084
What about it?

06:11.855 --> 06:14.139
He said he just wants a
relationship with you, right?

06:14.949 --> 06:16.583
I mean, if that's all he wants,

06:16.617 --> 06:17.702
why can't you just

06:17.822 --> 06:19.145
call him "Dad," or whatever.

You know, play along.

You don't have to drive me.

09:16.849 --> 09:17.964
I want to.

09:21.252 --> 09:24.329
I was thinking of calling her Isabella.

09:25.215 --> 09:26.789
What do you think?

09:29.170 --> 09:31.136
I think that's a beautiful name.

09:45.346 --> 09:46.625
Hey, Bryan?

09:46.745 --> 09:49.839
Bryan, hi. I'm Stef Adams-Foster.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.290
We met a few months ago when
Mike got his 90-day chip.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.897
The first one.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.388
Right. You're the ex-wife.

09:57.405 --> 09:58.693
Yeah.

09:58.727 --> 10:01.074
And you are his sponsor, yes?

10:03.018 --> 10:05.412
[school bell rings]

10:09.894 --> 10:10.654
Hey,

10:10.939 --> 10:13.072
- I was looking for you.
- You were?

10:13.192 --> 10:15.651
Yeah, uh, can we switch lab partners?

10:16.379 --> 10:17.489
Um...

10:18.280 --> 10:21.700
It's just, uh, Daria asked
me to be her partner, so...

10:25.757 --> 10:28.888
Yeah. Uh, it's cool.

10:33.576 --> 10:36.084
- [Connor] Oh, uh, Jude?
- Yeah.

10:36.204 --> 10:37.849
The potato?

10:38.566 --> 10:40.645
Taylor has yours.

10:46.704 --> 10:49.077
Sucks getting sexiled.

10:49.835 --> 10:51.442
"Sexiled?"

10:51.635 --> 10:54.623
When your friend leaves you
hangin' for their new boo.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.113
When did they become...

10:57.492 --> 11:00.092
- boos?
- [Taylor] Like, five minutes ago.

11:00.134 --> 11:02.477
But if you ask Daria, they're "OTP."

11:03.479 --> 11:06.140
But, hey, I'm down with being partners

11:06.630 --> 11:08.542
- if you are?
- Yeah...

11:08.768 --> 11:10.104
totally down.

11:15.727 --> 11:18.990
- We just have to take everything out.
- Yeah.

11:20.364 --> 11:21.748
You ready for the Algebra midterm?

11:21.797 --> 11:22.529
Yeah.

11:23.218 --> 11:24.554
No. Why?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.515
Coach wanted me to ask.

11:26.558 --> 11:30.070
He's trying to make sure the star of the
team doesn't go on academic probation.

11:30.081 --> 11:33.824
- "Star of the team."
- Never been a fan of false modesty, Foster.

11:34.376 --> 11:36.656
Well I've been studying... a little.

11:37.847 --> 11:40.599
I will because I broke up with Hayley.

11:40.648 --> 11:41.746
Oh.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.516
- You broke up with her?
- Yeah.

11:45.683 --> 11:48.222
So now I'll be completely
focused on the midterm, I swear.

11:48.714 --> 11:50.599
Well, you should probably get a tutor.

11:50.653 --> 11:51.902
Yeah. That's a good idea.

11:52.430 --> 11:54.773
Could you tell Coach that
I won't let the team down?

11:55.031 --> 11:56.103
I promise.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.102
[mid-tempo music]

12:03.665 --> 12:05.255
Hey, Jude!

12:05.567 --> 12:06.854
Come here.

12:08.638 --> 12:13.249
Oh, my God, Taylor was just telling us
how funny you were in science class today.

12:13.369 --> 12:15.901
Sit. Come have lunch with us.

12:16.021 --> 12:17.920
Um...

12:19.334 --> 12:21.110
OK.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.410
- Did you guys get your bulb lit?
- Uh, yeah.

12:25.452 --> 12:27.934
Creepy to think there's
electricity in your french fries.

12:27.968 --> 12:29.348
- [Daria laughs]
- [Connor] Right?

12:29.895 --> 12:33.067
<i>So, who's dying to see Bright Lights?</i>

12:33.109 --> 12:36.299
We read the book last summer
and we are totally obsessed.

12:36.419 --> 12:39.041
- What's the movie about?
- It's a chick flick.

12:39.161 --> 12:42.483
Hey, why don't we all go
see it tonight as a group?

12:43.135 --> 12:45.197
- Yeah, sure. Sounds good.
- Yeah.

12:45.525 --> 12:47.978
Uh, I have to make sure I can.

12:48.098 --> 12:50.755
There's a 7:00 and my
mom can totally drive us.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.776
Here, just put your number in my phone.

12:58.106 --> 12:58.707
Awesome.

12:59.317 --> 13:01.217
We have to go to the bathroom before class.

13:01.919 --> 13:03.888
I guess I have to pee.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.020
See you later.

13:10.387 --> 13:11.702
If you want, I can...

13:12.384 --> 13:14.043
- ... I can say my moms won't let me go.
- No.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.679
No, it's fine. I don't mind if you go.

13:19.204 --> 13:21.057
So is Daria your girlfriend?

13:22.039 --> 13:23.263
I guess.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.335
Yeah.

13:25.146 --> 13:26.245
I didn't know you...

13:26.555 --> 13:27.416
liked her.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.360
Well, she's hot.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.927
Uh... do you like Taylor?

13:32.983 --> 13:33.707
Yeah.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.073
She's nice.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.355
We're probably gonna be the
only dudes in the movie theater.

13:41.419 --> 13:43.277
- [both laugh]
- Yeah, probably.

13:43.729 --> 13:47.149
[mid-tempo music continues]

13:52.890 --> 13:54.668
Hey, braniac. Lunch?

13:55.389 --> 13:58.060
How about: Yo shorty, wanna eat?

13:59.057 --> 14:01.329
I can't. I'm having lunch with Tia.

14:01.366 --> 14:02.901
We've gotta talk about
dance team auditions.

14:02.950 --> 14:05.153
Aw, come on. There's a...

14:05.273 --> 14:06.887
There's a half PB&J in it for you.

14:07.007 --> 14:10.291
The organic kind where the peanuts
were sung to every night by the farmers.

14:10.668 --> 14:12.332
OK, look,

14:12.694 --> 14:15.231
I know you don't think that my dance
team is as important as your band,

14:15.351 --> 14:17.892
but I have to have something to do
all summer while you're off on tour.

14:19.029 --> 14:20.796
OK. Um...

14:21.464 --> 14:22.987
Sorry, I...

14:23.494 --> 14:25.971
But I'll see you later
tonight after practice?

14:26.462 --> 14:28.309
I don't know. I have to study.

14:28.429 --> 14:31.265
Midterms are coming up and I've got
tons of coding to do for STEM Club.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.874
Is everything cool with us?

14:35.203 --> 14:37.184
I'm just really busy.

14:37.841 --> 14:38.999
What does that mean?

14:39.031 --> 14:40.275
Busy, like, tonight or...

14:40.302 --> 14:42.629
I just don't think that I have
time for a relationship right now.

14:43.554 --> 14:45.355
[students chattering indistinctly]

14:52.862 --> 14:54.745
- So, um...
- Can we

14:54.865 --> 14:56.453
talk about this later?

14:56.658 --> 14:58.036
Tia's waiting on me.

15:04.763 --> 15:06.351
[Mike] You talked to my sponsor?

15:06.471 --> 15:07.983
Do you know how inappropriate that was?!

15:08.021 --> 15:10.369
- As inappropriate as your relationship with Ana?
- What?

15:10.660 --> 15:12.098
That's none of your business!

15:12.405 --> 15:14.268
And none of your sponsor's
either, apparently.

15:14.306 --> 15:15.679
You had no right, Stef.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.844
What, to tell him about Ana?
He had no idea who she was.

15:17.871 --> 15:19.406
It was an invasion of my
privacy and the program.

15:19.438 --> 15:21.151
The program? You're not
working the program, Mike.

15:21.199 --> 15:22.096
- You're not even being honest
- You don't get to

15:22.121 --> 15:23.199
- with your own sponsor.
- take my inventory.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.229
No, but I do get to protect my children.

15:25.275 --> 15:26.861
From the woman who abused them

15:26.916 --> 15:28.444
and then wormed her way
back into their lives.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.250
- She's not that person anymore.
- And took advantage of them.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.995
Just like she's taking advantage of you.

15:32.051 --> 15:34.171
Because you're so afraid
that you can't save yourself

15:34.188 --> 15:35.356
without saving someone else.

15:35.373 --> 15:36.704
You don't what the hell
you're talking about!

15:36.734 --> 15:38.074
She almost destroyed your life, Mike!

15:38.130 --> 15:40.013
Maybe that's what you want.
Maybe you want to self-destruct.

15:40.034 --> 15:42.159
- Maybe that's easier than staying sober.
- Shut up.

15:42.444 --> 15:44.986
You can steamroll over everybody
in your life, but not me.

15:45.249 --> 15:47.735
So why don't you mind your own business
and get the hell out of my life.

15:48.036 --> 15:48.971
You got that?

16:02.392 --> 16:03.943
- [sighs]
- [line ringing]

16:05.554 --> 16:06.153
<i>[Ana] Hello?</i>

16:06.187 --> 16:08.971
Hey, uh, it's me. I got
hung up. I'm on my way.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.134
It's OK. I'll call the doctor.

16:11.159 --> 16:14.710
<i>- I'm sure we can reschedule.
- [sighs] I'm really sorry.</i>

16:15.943 --> 16:18.345
Do we need anything from
the store for dinner?

16:18.399 --> 16:19.869
<i>No. We're fine.</i>

16:20.483 --> 16:21.565
Don't rush.

16:21.759 --> 16:23.019
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

16:26.945 --> 16:28.162
Sorry.

16:34.534 --> 16:35.761
So where's he taking you?

16:36.478 --> 16:38.174
Don't know. Don't care.

16:38.433 --> 16:40.205
You just have to spend
a few hours with the man.

16:40.410 --> 16:42.774
Yeah, a few awful awkward hours.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.370
Cut him a break. He just
wants to see his kid.

16:48.777 --> 16:51.645
So, um, have you heard
anything about Tasha?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.714
I get my first supervised
visit on Saturday.

16:53.748 --> 16:54.805
What?

16:55.118 --> 16:57.837
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't wanna jinx it.

16:59.156 --> 17:00.697
Aren't you excited?

17:01.256 --> 17:02.269
Yeah, but...

17:03.142 --> 17:05.328
- last time I seen her...
- She won't remember that.

17:05.517 --> 17:07.327
What if she remembers being scared

17:07.332 --> 17:08.727
'cause some stranger took her?

17:08.847 --> 17:10.972
You're not a stranger. You're her mother.

17:11.176 --> 17:13.310
At some level she's gotta
feel that connection.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.317
Do your moms know you're here?

17:21.625 --> 17:22.713
No.

17:23.758 --> 17:27.431
They don't want you to see me unsupervised.

17:28.804 --> 17:30.791
I'm not really here to see you.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.191
I mean,

17:32.606 --> 17:34.211
I came here because

17:35.062 --> 17:36.705
the baby is my...

17:37.604 --> 17:39.565
- ... is gonna be my...
- [Ana] Sister.

17:43.303 --> 17:44.509
It's a girl.

17:47.514 --> 17:48.494
[Mariana] I just...

17:50.142 --> 17:51.650
I don't want her

17:52.728 --> 17:54.284
to go through what we did.

17:59.522 --> 18:02.500
I don't want her to feel
like she isn't enough.

18:03.334 --> 18:05.252
And to spend her whole life

18:05.572 --> 18:08.744
scared that people are gonna leave her.

18:12.809 --> 18:15.392
And I just don't think
that you can be a mother.

18:16.469 --> 18:19.726
I don't think that you
can take care of a baby.

18:20.871 --> 18:22.806
And maybe...

18:23.058 --> 18:25.171
maybe you can't help it, but...

18:27.796 --> 18:29.984
I don't want another
little girl to get hurt...

18:30.707 --> 18:32.306
... like I did.

18:44.315 --> 18:46.604
- Hot date?
- No.

18:46.878 --> 18:49.224
Connor and I are going to
a movie with some girls.

18:49.256 --> 18:50.404
As a group.

18:50.791 --> 18:53.043
As a group? [laughs]

18:53.163 --> 18:54.717
That's what people tell their parents

18:54.734 --> 18:56.764
when they don't want them to
know what they're really doing.

18:57.394 --> 19:00.000
- What are we really doing?
- [Jesus] "Going to the movies."

19:00.120 --> 19:03.234
A dark place you can do things with
a girl that you can't do in the light.

19:04.457 --> 19:05.681
Hooking up?

19:07.929 --> 19:08.774
Here.

19:08.998 --> 19:10.976
- Walk into this.
- Why?

19:11.045 --> 19:12.932
Girls love a guy who smells good.

19:14.061 --> 19:15.513
[coughing]

19:17.249 --> 19:19.589
- Hi, Mrs. Adams-Foster.
- Emma, hi.

19:20.257 --> 19:21.432
[stammers] What are you...

19:21.631 --> 19:22.992
- Are you here for...
- Me.

19:23.669 --> 19:24.414
Hey.

19:25.284 --> 19:28.072
- OK. Are you two... ?
- No.

19:28.192 --> 19:30.885
- She's tutoring me.
- Oh, good!

19:31.109 --> 19:33.077
Great, actually. It's
nice to see you, Emma.

19:33.111 --> 19:36.160
- Wanna get started? Go up?
- Why don't you two use the dining room?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.492
Sounds good.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.416
Mm. You smell awfully nice.

19:41.536 --> 19:43.349
- I just showered.
- [Lena] Hmm.

19:43.689 --> 19:45.856
[doorbell rings]

19:49.259 --> 19:50.244
Hey.

19:50.293 --> 19:51.946
Hello. Come on in.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.328
Hey, Callie? Robert's here.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.159
You have a beautiful home.

19:58.775 --> 19:59.938
We like it.

20:00.423 --> 20:01.549
So does Callie.

20:05.185 --> 20:07.618
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

20:08.788 --> 20:11.261
So, have her home by, uh, what, ten?

20:11.497 --> 20:13.607
- Sounds good.
- Do you need a sweater, honey?

20:13.727 --> 20:14.644
No, it's OK.

20:14.705 --> 20:16.085
- I'll see you soon.
- Mm-hm.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.909
- [Stef] I love you.
- [Callie] Love you.

20:18.205 --> 20:19.477
Bye.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.688
Thanks.

20:39.089 --> 20:41.822
Don't forget to apply
the distributive property.

20:42.262 --> 20:44.105
OK. Then multiply.

20:44.354 --> 20:46.866
And express as a rational function.

20:48.670 --> 20:49.902
Boom!

20:53.363 --> 20:54.386
You got it.

20:54.844 --> 20:57.025
You're the only one who gets
me to understand this crap.

20:57.145 --> 20:58.809
"F times "G" times "X"?

20:58.929 --> 21:01.072
Without you, it looks like
somebody barfed up alphabet soup.

21:01.112 --> 21:02.358
[laughs]

21:02.438 --> 21:04.101
Thanks for doing this.

21:04.573 --> 21:07.379
Yeah, just takin' one for the team.

21:07.499 --> 21:08.941
So... you're miserable?

21:09.183 --> 21:11.312
- Completely.
- [both laugh]

21:11.347 --> 21:13.021
I'm really sorry.

21:13.715 --> 21:15.283
For what?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.385
I should've been honest
about hooking up with Hayley.

21:17.419 --> 21:19.579
I mean, technically we were broken up...

21:20.055 --> 21:23.200
So "technically" this doesn't
sound like a real apology.

21:23.584 --> 21:26.654
It is. Last few months, I
made some stupid decisions.

21:26.774 --> 21:28.196
Really stupid decisions.

21:28.230 --> 21:29.508
It's OK.

21:30.065 --> 21:31.299
I forgive you.

21:32.140 --> 21:33.049
And...

21:33.560 --> 21:35.136
I've missed you.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.384
I miss you, too.

21:39.148 --> 21:41.080
Wh... What're you doing?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.743
You need to get a new tutor.

21:42.776 --> 21:43.848
- [Jesus] Wait!
- Maybe a guy.

21:43.875 --> 21:44.837
No, no. I need you.

21:44.878 --> 21:46.238
We can be friends, I swear.

21:46.285 --> 21:47.941
Look! I'll prove it to you.

21:54.243 --> 21:56.504
That picture there was
taken with a Hasselblad.

21:56.624 --> 22:00.093
It has that... that, like,
look-down-style viewing screen, you know,

22:00.140 --> 22:01.661
and a hand crank to advance the film.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.654
You ever shot with film?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.175
No, just digital.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.452
I'd like to, it just
costs too much to develop.

22:07.486 --> 22:09.420
Hm. Well, you could always
set up your own dark room,

22:09.454 --> 22:12.224
- learn how to develop yourself.
- Yeah well, there's, uh...

22:12.257 --> 22:14.616
... there's not really a lot of
extra space where I live, so...

22:17.190 --> 22:18.973
Well, anyway,

22:19.205 --> 22:20.820
the Hasselblad is responsible

22:20.863 --> 22:22.947
for that beautiful blur
you see in the photograph.

22:23.235 --> 22:24.902
They call it "bokeh."

22:25.022 --> 22:28.591
You can't get that kind of effect
with a digital camera really.

22:29.868 --> 22:32.130
- Hm.
- [Callie] How do you know so much about photography?

22:33.418 --> 22:35.770
Well, it's, uh... It's
always been a hobby that I

22:35.890 --> 22:37.332
share with Sophia.

22:37.634 --> 22:40.569
You know, actually, you both
have a better eye than I do.

22:43.504 --> 22:44.840
How's she doing?

22:48.286 --> 22:49.369
Well, uh...

22:49.956 --> 22:51.976
... her doctors think it's some kind of

22:53.172 --> 22:54.911
personality disorder.

22:56.268 --> 22:58.998
I'm not entirely sure what that
means, to be honest with you.

22:59.322 --> 23:00.043
Um...

23:00.657 --> 23:03.184
she's on medication, which is helping.

23:03.733 --> 23:05.258
But they want her to stay at the

23:05.285 --> 23:07.811
treatment center a little while
longer, just so they can...

23:08.958 --> 23:10.514
... you know, keep an eye on her.

23:12.518 --> 23:15.566
I'm really sorry I didn't
realize how sad she was.

23:16.503 --> 23:18.641
Yeah... yeah.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.924
We didn't either, and we're her parents.

23:25.233 --> 23:27.155
I got her a gift.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.152
A pair of hair pins with horses on them.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.247
- I don't know if she'll like it.
- Are you kidding me?

23:33.367 --> 23:35.466
She'll love them. Especially
since they're from you.

23:35.708 --> 23:37.733
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

23:40.355 --> 23:42.165
[laughs] What, are you
not a fan of cilantro?

23:42.456 --> 23:44.158
Yeah, I don't really like it.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.342
- It kind of tastes like...
- Soap?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.574
Mm-hm.

23:49.097 --> 23:51.612
[Robert laughs]

23:52.503 --> 23:53.404
Hold on.

23:54.279 --> 23:57.695
You think that showing me you got the
name of the girl who you hooked up with

23:57.730 --> 23:59.182
a hot minute after we broke up,

23:59.225 --> 24:01.013
tattooed over half your torso,

24:01.013 --> 24:02.482
is proof that we can be friends?

24:02.913 --> 24:06.187
Because... knowing you
did something that stupid

24:06.261 --> 24:08.100
means that I won't ever
be attracted to you again.

24:08.118 --> 24:10.673
And if you know that I won't ever
be attracted to you again, then...

24:11.146 --> 24:12.939
... you won't try to get
back together with me?

24:13.960 --> 24:15.973
- Yes.
- That is some strange logic.

24:16.007 --> 24:17.351
But it kind of makes sense, right?

24:17.471 --> 24:19.850
Well, I definitely never want
to see you shirtless ever again.

24:19.970 --> 24:21.819
Please, Emma. Wrestling's all I have.

24:21.979 --> 24:23.538
Everything else I screw up.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.812
If I fail Algebra I'll just be
a loser with a stupid tattoo.

24:30.126 --> 24:31.022
OK.

24:31.509 --> 24:34.163
- I'm getting the tattoo removed, though.
- Jesus,

24:34.504 --> 24:36.378
just quit while you're ahead.

24:37.523 --> 24:38.286
[Robert] Mm!

24:39.579 --> 24:41.139
I never get to order this.

24:41.259 --> 24:43.708
Jill and Sophia are always
insisting on something chocolate.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.379
No, chocolate's too obvious.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.409
- [laughs] Cheers to that.
- [spoons clink]

24:47.706 --> 24:48.848
[both laugh]

24:50.636 --> 24:51.550
So...

24:52.299 --> 24:53.575
have you ever seen

24:53.850 --> 24:55.785
the "Ashes and Snow" exhibit?

24:56.246 --> 24:57.677
- No, I've never heard of it.
- Oh!

24:59.042 --> 25:01.157
They're these unbelievable photographs

25:01.204 --> 25:03.833
of humans and animals in
nature. I mean, they're.. T

25:03.915 --> 25:05.637
here's just no words
that describe it. It's...

25:05.689 --> 25:06.775
It is breathtaking.

25:06.991 --> 25:08.624
Wow, I'd love to see it.

25:09.106 --> 25:10.963
Well, It's in La Jolla right now.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.491
It closes this weekend, but if
you're interested and willing,

25:15.038 --> 25:17.464
you know, maybe we could
drive up for the day on Sunday.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.789
I mean, it's... You know, it's not a...

25:21.194 --> 25:25.183
- Court-mandated?
- Yeah. It's elective, as they say.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.441
I'll ask Stef and Lena.

25:29.587 --> 25:30.376
Right.

25:34.014 --> 25:36.182
You know, you don't have to
get custody of me to hang out.

25:37.518 --> 25:39.492
If what you want is a relationship,

25:39.522 --> 25:40.781
we can have that,

25:41.599 --> 25:43.314
even if I get adopted by the Fosters.

25:43.684 --> 25:46.424
I don't just want to hang out, Callie.

25:47.648 --> 25:48.475
I want to be your dad.

25:48.492 --> 25:50.543
Well, you are my dad. Genetically.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.012
That's not gonna change if I get adopted.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.859
I guess I mean, parent.
I want to be your parent.

25:55.924 --> 25:56.962
And what about Jude?

25:57.639 --> 25:59.953
You think it's OK to separate us
because you want to "parent" me?

25:59.996 --> 26:02.470
- No, look, that's not what I want.
- But that's what would happen.

26:02.745 --> 26:04.524
Jude can come over whenever he wants.

26:04.550 --> 26:06.502
- I mean, he can have his own room.
- That's not what I want.

26:07.445 --> 26:09.660
- Does that not matter to you at all?
- Callie,

26:09.703 --> 26:10.841
if I had known about you earlier,

26:10.862 --> 26:12.827
- I would have adopted him.
- Well, it's too late.

26:12.947 --> 26:16.351
That's because Jude's dad
couldn't take care of him or you.

26:16.635 --> 26:19.441
- But I can.
- Why? Because we both hate cilantro and you're rich?

26:24.099 --> 26:25.120
Drive me home, please?

26:26.818 --> 26:28.149
And I'll pass on Sunday.

26:37.553 --> 26:39.903
- Where should we sit?
- Wherever you want.

26:41.301 --> 26:42.693
Oh, actually...

26:42.861 --> 26:44.223
why don't we sit in the back?

26:45.985 --> 26:48.436
Or we could just sit right there.

26:49.847 --> 26:52.788
Yeah, but if people are
talking during the movie,

26:53.132 --> 26:54.964
it's quieter in the back.

- Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.

33:34.124 --> 33:38.370
So... what's going on? Are you OK?

33:40.612 --> 33:42.966
Is it the tour? Because

33:42.977 --> 33:47.162
I'll be away for three weeks
of our first summer together?

33:50.648 --> 33:53.424
Do you want to add anything here, or...

33:54.699 --> 33:59.059
- No, that's pretty much it.

I'm just... gonna miss you.

I'm gonna... I'm gonna miss you, too.

34:15.059 --> 34:17.178
I want to go on tour, but it's not like I'm

34:17.197 --> 34:19.646
looking forward to the
part where you're not there.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.418
And you know,

34:45.688 --> 34:47.340
we wouldn't have to miss each other at all

34:47.347 --> 34:49.078
if I went on tour with you.

34:49.927 --> 34:52.349
But... would your moms let you?

34:52.469 --> 34:54.217
Well, they're letting
Brandon, they have to let me.

34:54.271 --> 34:56.067
Yeah, but he's in the band.

34:56.436 --> 34:58.741
Well... I could be your manager.

34:58.775 --> 35:01.175

I don't have a life.

Oh. Well.

36:51.978 --> 36:53.394
I just moved to San Diego.

So I'm still making friends, I guess.

- Do you remember buying this?

[low-tempo music]
