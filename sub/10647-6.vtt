WEBVTT

00:07.482 --> 00:08.925
Slow it down, punk.

00:08.950 --> 00:11.137
What are you trying to do?
Throw me out of the plane?

00:11.530 --> 00:14.697
Yeah. I know I'm not usually your
friendly neighborhood speed-demon.

00:14.731 --> 00:16.312
But we're on an important mission.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.227
<i>It turns out our fellow S.H.I.E.L.D.
student, Rhino, was a spy for Doc Ock,</i>

00:20.252 --> 00:22.664
<i>which I only figured out
after Rhino sprung Ock</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.198
<i>from a S.H.I.E.L.D. holding
cell and nabbed Agent Venom.</i>

00:25.223 --> 00:28.291
Because I trusted Rhino,
Doc Ock has Flash.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.161
So it's up to me and Mr.
Sunshine here to bring him back.

00:31.311 --> 00:33.224
Not sure what we're even looking for.

00:33.249 --> 00:35.660
Energy signatures.
Cephalopod-based crimes.

00:35.685 --> 00:37.676
Anything that could lead us
to Agent Venom.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.344
How long before we give up on this?

00:39.534 --> 00:41.549
Iron Spider and Miles aren't even here.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.223
Because they're following up
on another lead.

00:43.248 --> 00:45.210
I don't leave friends behind, Scarlet.

00:45.235 --> 00:46.789
It's kind of the point of friends.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.793
Friends.

00:47.818 --> 00:50.687
Yeah, friends run away
the second things get hard.

00:50.712 --> 00:53.131
Is that how you wound up
trapped by Doc Ock?

00:53.282 --> 00:54.537
Someone left you behind?

00:54.571 --> 00:56.113
You wanna talk about my past?

00:56.138 --> 00:58.420
Or do you wanna check out
the energy signature

00:58.445 --> 01:00.930
that just popped up at one
of Doc Ock's old labs?

01:01.103 --> 01:03.285
Your friend might be there.

01:03.310 --> 01:04.200
Good catch.

01:04.224 --> 01:06.244
Let's see who forgot
to turn out the lights.

01:18.315 --> 01:21.461
This lab's deserted. I'm guessing
no one's been here in months.

01:21.489 --> 01:23.243
I'm still
getting the energy reading.

01:27.682 --> 01:29.688
Hold on. Bingo!

01:29.841 --> 01:32.541
- They must be inside.
- Then let's get this over with.

01:39.539 --> 01:41.363
A door trap?
An evil laugh?

01:41.418 --> 01:42.616
Oh, don't tell me.

01:42.668 --> 01:44.779
That's right, Spider-Man.

01:46.648 --> 01:51.865
Where you have been hunting for your 
comrade... Kraven has been hunting you.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.378
Just once I want
someone to step out of the shadows

01:54.403 --> 01:56.161
who doesn't want to destroy me.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.162
What is it, open season on spiders?

02:10.197 --> 02:12.131
I hope you have an up-to-date
hero hunting license.

02:12.999 --> 02:17.601
I shall earn not one trophy, but two.
You have no hope of me.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.071
Does it look like I'm running, punk?

02:28.215 --> 02:29.315
A word of advice.

02:29.349 --> 02:32.151
When fighting Kraven,
the extreme mustache king,

02:32.185 --> 02:33.986
distance is your friend.

02:34.020 --> 02:34.831
Watch out!

02:39.680 --> 02:41.528
Trip wire, poison darts.

02:41.553 --> 02:44.117
Really? What's next?
A pit trap full of spikes?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.068
Hot tub! I meant to say hot tub!

02:50.564 --> 02:52.620
You won't escape me, Spider.

02:52.645 --> 02:57.209
The Octopus promised me a place on the 
Sinister Six when I bring you to him.

02:57.244 --> 03:00.654
And I, Kraven, will have my reward.

03:00.679 --> 03:03.601
Oh, good. Because I was starting
to worry that this was personal.

03:05.662 --> 03:06.952
Bear traps?

03:08.803 --> 03:11.819
Ow! Watch it! I'm a spider.

03:12.081 --> 03:14.989
For a guy named the Hunter, you
don't know your animals that well.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.331
Can't we stop all this attacking
and talk about this?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.169
I think you made your point.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.876
And that's called wordplay, kids.

03:24.513 --> 03:26.960
If these traps don't kill
me, your jokes will.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.180
Come on, we need to
get to higher ground.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.424
Fleeing already? I'm
only getting warmed up.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.453
You booby trapped the roof, too?

03:41.488 --> 03:43.122
How much free time do you have?

03:43.156 --> 03:46.394
The desperate lowing of wounded prey.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.299
Couldn't have booby
trapped all of Manhattan.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.616
Let's move this party.

04:02.989 --> 04:05.682
Okay, maybe he did booby
trap all of Manhattan.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.767
Great. Trapped by a nut case.

04:15.021 --> 04:18.190
This stuff is un-breakable. What's it
made of? Kraven's hair tonic?

04:18.214 --> 04:19.911
And this is your cue to bail.

04:19.937 --> 04:22.973
That's what so-called "friends"
do when things get too tough.

04:22.998 --> 04:24.580
There's no way I'm leaving you.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.102
Like Scarlet wasn't
already having trust issues.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.137
Now Kraven tries to make me a liar.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.834
Yeah, I'm gonna rescue Scarlet.

04:45.999 --> 04:49.592
But if Kraven's heading to Ock, that means
he's also heading to Agent Venom.

04:49.698 --> 04:51.599
Two teammates, one rescue.

04:51.642 --> 04:53.538
Plus, I get to air dry on the way.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.611
Is it just me, or is the
air getting a little thin?

05:05.661 --> 05:08.148
And why are we pulling so many Gs?

05:09.342 --> 05:12.326
Space. Uh, spiders don't do space.

05:12.636 --> 05:14.947
Except for the ones
that work for S.H.I.E.L.D.

05:18.712 --> 05:22.169
But I'm betting it's more
comfortable inside the ship.

05:30.342 --> 05:33.468
Space isn't Kraven's normal hunting
grounds. Where would he...

05:34.033 --> 05:35.134
Hydra Island?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.700
The giant fortress
we shot into deep space?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.838
Guess we didn't shoot it deep enough.

05:41.241 --> 05:45.468
When I'm outta this, I'll take
you on your last hunt, punk.

05:46.436 --> 05:51.695
The instant Spider-Man comes to get
you, he'll face both Kraven and Hydra.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.096
His downfall is certain.

05:55.348 --> 05:58.561
You think Spider-Man's gonna
storm a space fortress for me?

05:58.899 --> 06:02.928
No. I'm nothing to him. No
one's ever risked anything for me.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.613
And they're not gonna start now.

06:06.479 --> 06:09.001
Either Scarlet's taken
some serious acting classes,

06:09.035 --> 06:10.860
or he really thinks
I'd leave him behind.

06:11.423 --> 06:13.339
And I don't think
he's the theater type.

06:16.343 --> 06:19.244
Let me out of here, Dr. Psycho-pants.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.845
Do not worry.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.720
I'll soon have you free of that parasite.

06:23.838 --> 06:28.120
Then you will be welcomed
into the reborn Sinister Six.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.122
I'll never betray Spidey.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.999
And the Venom symbiote isn't a parasite.
It helps me.

06:34.024 --> 06:38.728
I wasn't talking to you, dolt.
You are the parasite.

06:38.753 --> 06:43.154
Without you, the symbiote can achieve
what it was always meant to.

06:43.242 --> 06:45.882
The destruction of Spider-Man.

06:48.839 --> 06:52.593
It is only matter of locating
the right frequency.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.466
Unconsciousness is only
a brief escape for you.

06:56.673 --> 07:01.013
- Soon you will be my greatest success.
- Success?

07:01.927 --> 07:05.879
Do you even know the meaning
of the word, Octavius?

07:06.101 --> 07:09.070
I brought this fortress
back from beyond Saturn.

07:09.195 --> 07:12.331
But did I discover
that you, my brilliant ally,

07:12.365 --> 07:15.436
have tracked down Nick Fury's
secret location?

07:15.542 --> 07:16.340
<i>Nein.</i>

07:16.598 --> 07:21.749
Because you continue to obsess over
Spider-Man, and these child heroes.

07:21.773 --> 07:25.368
Our attack on S.H.I.E.L.D.
failed because of Spider-Man.

07:25.393 --> 07:27.662
Destroying him is key.

07:27.687 --> 07:30.551
You are a guest on my island.

07:30.578 --> 07:36.719
I expect progress immediately,
or you will answer to Hydra.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.146
Keep moving. I don't have all day.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.487
Okay, superhero checklist.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.354
One, save Scarlet Spider.

08:01.379 --> 08:03.214
Two, rescue Agent Venom.

08:03.239 --> 08:05.112
Three, get back to Earth.

08:05.557 --> 08:06.777
What was four again?

08:09.564 --> 08:11.697
Oh, yeah. Don't get caught.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.095
Not even a "Hail Hydra" first?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.963
Well, at least you guys can't hit
the broad side of a Tri-Carrier.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.887
Move, fools. Kraven will down this prey.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.351
I'll just show myself out.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.344
Watch your back.

08:32.130 --> 08:33.010
Whoops!

08:38.789 --> 08:39.952
You came after me.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.676
You make that sound like a bad thing.

08:41.701 --> 08:44.319
- Friends rescue friends, remember?
- Great.

08:44.344 --> 08:46.307
Here comes the important life lesson.

08:47.850 --> 08:50.156
Did I mention friends keep
each other alive, too?

08:50.181 --> 08:52.122
Yeah. I can't promise that.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.383
This is the part where I
do the "stick around" gag.

09:03.408 --> 09:04.267
Get it?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.814
Keep 'em busy.
I'll get some cover.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.915
Okay, guys,

09:09.949 --> 09:12.437
let's try some extracurricular
web activities.

09:19.444 --> 09:21.333
How does starting up
a Hydra ship give us cover?

09:21.358 --> 09:22.146
Whoa!

09:27.539 --> 09:28.972
Oh, never mind.

09:31.871 --> 09:32.971
<i>Fire detected.</i>

09:33.006 --> 09:35.741
<i>Atmosphere ejection
countdown commencing.</i>

09:35.775 --> 09:36.742
Retreat!

09:39.032 --> 09:41.665
- Let's move it, Spider. 
- Not that way. I've got a plan.

09:41.690 --> 09:45.082
- Does it involve breathing in space?
- Actually, yeah.

09:46.103 --> 09:47.100
Huh?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.343
And you didn't wanna wear the
S.H.I.E.L.D.-authorized uniform.

09:51.495 --> 09:54.424
I was hoping I wouldn't be able
to hear you with this thing on.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.846
See how I'm just letting that go?

09:56.200 --> 09:56.962
Friendship.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.357
<i>Atmosphere ejection initiated.</i>

10:05.552 --> 10:07.773
And how is this
better than being in air vents?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.259
Which have air in them?

10:09.330 --> 10:11.037
Because now I can see the whole island.

10:11.298 --> 10:13.607
Hydra Island was built from
the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier,

10:13.632 --> 10:15.994
which yours truly knows
like the back of my webs.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.916
If I was gonna hold Agent Venom
anywhere on the carrier, it'd be there.

10:21.591 --> 10:22.661
Whoa!

10:22.805 --> 10:24.745
It's called weightlessness.

10:24.868 --> 10:27.296
Aren't you supposed to be
some kind of science nerd?

10:27.311 --> 10:28.507
Cut me some slack.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.378
I'm only in space
a couple times a year.

10:30.418 --> 10:31.340
Let's go.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.425
Whoa! Web jets!

10:35.287 --> 10:36.477
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

10:36.502 --> 10:38.518
- We should do this more often. 
- No.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.147
- Flash?
- Spider...

10:43.375 --> 10:45.086
Man!

10:48.298 --> 10:49.564
Hang on, Flash.

10:54.743 --> 10:57.330
That's not Flash anymore.
It's a wounded creature.

10:57.355 --> 10:59.958
- We can't release him.
- He's my friend, Scarlet.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.655
And if we can keep him alive, I bet
he'll become your friend, too.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.428
No!

11:08.935 --> 11:11.677
Leave us alone!

11:14.332 --> 11:15.688
That's some friend.

11:15.713 --> 11:18.151
Ock must've been trying
to remove the Venom symbiote.

11:18.308 --> 11:20.399
But he's only
driven it crazy with pain.

11:20.736 --> 11:23.234
I am Venom!

11:23.363 --> 11:25.250
Maybe more pain will help.

11:32.892 --> 11:33.984
Sorry, Flash.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.947
If you were trying to convince me
about the value of friendship,

11:55.982 --> 11:57.315
you totally failed.

11:57.429 --> 11:59.520
Geez, what did
your old buddies do to you?

11:59.545 --> 12:01.138
Everybody values friendship.

12:01.284 --> 12:02.884
Wait. That's it!

12:03.695 --> 12:05.306
Flash, listen to me.

12:05.449 --> 12:06.406
Calm down.

12:07.782 --> 12:09.233
What are you doing?

12:09.417 --> 12:11.776
Trying to hug it out?
That thing will crush you.

12:14.913 --> 12:16.159
Scarlet, I got this.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.376
Flash, it's me.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.107
Spi...

12:22.560 --> 12:23.870
Spidey?

12:29.015 --> 12:31.171
Yeah. Now, let's get you home.

12:31.196 --> 12:33.725
The symbiote is home!

12:33.920 --> 12:37.442
- Restrain them.
- Rhino! Why did you betray us?

12:37.507 --> 12:38.729
We trusted you.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.057
Do you want that cure or not?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.302
Sorry, Spider-Man.

13:06.209 --> 13:09.147
Doc, stop! You're hurting him.

13:09.499 --> 13:12.630
The host's survival is not my concern.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.800
Or yours!

13:13.860 --> 13:15.994
Rhino, we need your help.

13:16.028 --> 13:22.193
You're asking for help from the traitor
who's trying to crush us?

13:25.972 --> 13:31.362
I betrayed my friends for a cure.
But I won't destroy them for one.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.120
Go, go!

13:41.806 --> 13:46.032
All that effort and those fools
rescued the wrong subject.

13:48.608 --> 13:50.167
Flash, you okay?

13:50.192 --> 13:51.369
Can you hear me?

13:51.723 --> 13:55.934
Can't go.
No one left behind.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.924
Don't worry, we're not leaving you.

13:57.937 --> 13:58.765
We should.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.435
He's just gonna slow us down.

14:00.460 --> 14:01.979
We wouldn't have made it
out of that room

14:02.004 --> 14:04.404
if Rhino wasn't
stupid enough to help us.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.911
It wasn't stupidity.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.281
It was a change of heart.

14:07.552 --> 14:08.766
I knew he had it in him.

14:08.791 --> 14:11.528
Look, he betrayed the academy
and abducted Venom.

14:11.648 --> 14:13.731
Those aren't things
I'm ready to forget.

14:15.262 --> 14:16.526
We better get out of sight.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.227
Spider-Man.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.410
He was ejected into space.

14:24.435 --> 14:25.954
Another trick.

14:25.979 --> 14:28.634
Just like he tricked you
into bringing him here.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.829
The destruction of my lab
is your fault, Kraven.

14:31.904 --> 14:35.006
You demanded I bring you
Spider-Man and I did.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.875
Now give me what was promised.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.729
A place on the Sinister Six.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.176
And then, I'll consider
helping you further.

14:41.201 --> 14:43.630
You want a place on the Six?

14:44.558 --> 14:47.640
Then you can be our Venom.

14:50.403 --> 14:51.216
No!

14:57.166 --> 14:59.347
Strap Flash in, I'll start the jet.

15:00.617 --> 15:01.740
Spidey.

15:01.765 --> 15:04.240
Can't leave a teammate.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.122
- We've got you, Flash.
- Not me.

15:08.416 --> 15:09.991
The symbiote.

15:10.253 --> 15:11.746
There's no way we can...

15:15.670 --> 15:17.949
Don't think that
symbiote's feeling really friendly.

15:22.207 --> 15:24.230
Then you two should get along great.

15:25.608 --> 15:28.472
There's out you, Kraven.
New haircut?

15:31.954 --> 15:33.693
Kraven hates your jokes, too.

15:35.557 --> 15:38.753
Why does working with you always
involve jumping out of a plane?

15:38.788 --> 15:41.242
Not true. Sometimes we
jump out of spaceships.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.995
If Cho asks who ruined his plane,

15:47.029 --> 15:48.387
I'm blaming you.

15:51.734 --> 15:52.632
Wait!

15:53.131 --> 15:54.541
Flash, come back!

15:54.737 --> 15:56.871
It's me, your buddy.

16:01.866 --> 16:03.678
I think the feeling
might be a bit one-sided.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.614
Time to do things my way...

16:05.648 --> 16:06.648
In shadow.

16:12.243 --> 16:13.755
Did he just jump that?

16:13.789 --> 16:15.346
Who cares?
Send him back down.

16:15.371 --> 16:17.108
Next stop, ground floor.

16:22.869 --> 16:26.118
The hunt begins.

16:32.545 --> 16:34.743
You're lucky.
This place is empty.

16:34.777 --> 16:37.753
Oh, so is that what this
slightly nauseating feeling is?

16:37.778 --> 16:40.256
- Luck?
- Do you ever stop joking?

16:40.716 --> 16:44.953
Your buddy Flash just tried to handshake
that Venom-Kraven-lion thing.

16:44.987 --> 16:47.978
I'm going with Kravenom,
but it's just a working name.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.824
Flash is going to get himself hurt.

16:49.859 --> 16:53.026
- We can't leave him alone for...
- That's exactly what we have to do.

16:53.051 --> 16:56.002
We got to cut this guy loose
before he gets us obliterated.

16:56.034 --> 16:58.522
I know you're not into humor
but that better be a joke.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.136
Let's just find a way off this
rock, before it's too late.

17:07.308 --> 17:09.173
What, Hydra doesn't know
how to clean vents?

17:09.198 --> 17:11.416
Try living in a sewer for a few years.

17:11.442 --> 17:12.874
The landing base through there.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.742
- We'll make it if...
- No, you won't!

17:24.423 --> 17:25.808
Kraven, hey!

17:25.828 --> 17:29.056
Now that you're all Venomed up,
any interest in joining the Web-Warriors?

17:33.491 --> 17:34.938
Guess it can hurt to ask.

17:58.441 --> 17:59.761
Flash, stay down.

17:59.795 --> 18:01.665
We've got to work together.

18:01.897 --> 18:05.517
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you
can't fight without your powers.

18:18.042 --> 18:21.060
I told you Flash
would be the end of us.

18:22.058 --> 18:23.856
Always save yourself first.

18:27.050 --> 18:28.932
I want my friend back.

18:38.953 --> 18:39.674
What?

18:39.781 --> 18:40.664
No!

18:41.771 --> 18:42.787
What is this?

18:43.334 --> 18:44.217
Oh!

18:48.241 --> 18:49.686
Check it out!

18:51.638 --> 18:54.767
Yes! Agent Venom is back!

18:54.792 --> 18:56.354
And better than ever.

18:56.364 --> 18:57.619
Great to have you back.

18:57.653 --> 18:59.554
At least I don't have to carry you.

18:59.588 --> 19:01.656
That's Scarlet-speak for,
"Glad you're okay."

19:01.690 --> 19:03.877
Thanks for the rescue.
Both of you.

19:05.940 --> 19:06.940
It could just be me,

19:06.965 --> 19:09.799
but I'm getting a run-for-our-lives
kind of vibe right now.

19:12.768 --> 19:14.194
Landing base this way.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.330
Leaving my island so soon?

19:17.442 --> 19:22.152
You must stay, enjoy our hospitality.

19:30.619 --> 19:32.754
Scarlet, where are you going?

19:32.788 --> 19:35.104
You guys got some
loyalty issues, Spidey.

19:35.147 --> 19:36.933
It's kind of a thing with him.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.100
Goodbye, Spider-Man...

19:45.768 --> 19:48.314
I thought you guys
stopped being dead weight.

19:50.157 --> 19:51.806
Look at that,
you weren't running away.

19:51.841 --> 19:54.444
You were circling around
to save your friends.

19:54.469 --> 19:56.329
Less talking, more running.

20:05.821 --> 20:08.336
The jet's trash, but I can
probably fly one of these.

20:08.757 --> 20:10.356
Wait, "probably"?

20:23.178 --> 20:24.523
<i>He's gone?</i>

20:24.548 --> 20:27.981
<i>Once again, your incompetence has
permitted Spider-Man to win.</i>

20:28.024 --> 20:29.651
<i>Hydra has no...</i>

20:31.091 --> 20:35.697
Your loyalty to your old friends allowed
them to escape with the symbiote, Rhino.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.569
But like your condition,

20:37.820 --> 20:40.215
loyalty can be cured.

20:49.765 --> 20:51.313
Nice landing, Scarlet.

20:52.768 --> 20:54.294
Even without my symbiote,

20:54.319 --> 20:57.547
I'm sure Ock won't stop until
he has his Sinister Six.

20:57.572 --> 20:59.675
Then we'll have to get his
future recruits before he can.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.058
- Hey, look who's back!
- How'd you escape?

21:02.083 --> 21:03.275
'Sup, peeps?

21:04.503 --> 21:08.273
Anyone who wants to hear the story
buys me an extra-large chili dog.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.273
I like the brooding, looks great on you.

21:12.476 --> 21:13.777
But I bet you'd still
look cool enjoying

21:13.802 --> 21:15.706
an extra-large chili dog
with everyone else.

21:15.925 --> 21:18.177
You know, maybe
friendship's got some perks,

21:18.202 --> 21:20.444
but it's not really my... Whoa!

21:20.552 --> 21:23.307
Hey, wuss.
You up for some sparring?

21:23.394 --> 21:25.744
I want to see what my upgrade
can do before dinner.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.094
You're on, punk.

21:28.971 --> 21:31.292
Well, that's kinda progress.
