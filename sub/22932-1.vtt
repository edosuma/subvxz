00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:05.710 --> 00:08.250
Christmas is a magical
time of year in the Diaz house,

00:08.250 --> 00:10.330
full of holiday traditions--

00:10.330 --> 00:12.460
the fight over who gets to
hang the star on the tree,

00:12.460 --> 00:14.330
the fight over
who gets the biggest stocking,

00:14.330 --> 00:16.080
the fight over...

00:16.080 --> 00:18.620
I'm realizing
it's a lot of fighting.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.170
But one thing
we can all agree on

00:20.170 --> 00:22.250
is making our pasteles.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.620
I'm going to pretend
you didn't use those

00:25.620 --> 00:27.080
to dig for worms.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.250
Wait, how long do you
steam these pasteles?

00:36.960 --> 00:38.710
Rachel, of course,
chose the one job

00:38.710 --> 00:40.670
she could do without
looking up from her phone--

00:40.670 --> 00:42.500
setting the timer
for the steamer.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.380
She also chose to go
to France this Christmas

00:44.380 --> 00:45.750
with her friend's family,

00:45.750 --> 00:48.670
so the pastele train
is cut short.

00:48.670 --> 00:50.670
I'll ask Mom.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.330
Never mind.
You're busy.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.880
I guess somebody
has to call abuela.
Who wants to...

01:04.380 --> 01:06.420
This time of year,

01:06.420 --> 01:08.710
no one wants
to call abuela.

01:08.710 --> 01:10.380
Not because
we don't love her.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.540
We have the best abuela
in the world.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.120
She even has
a T-shirt to prove it.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.420
Will you come to Florida
for Christmas?

01:17.420 --> 01:19.540
Seeing you all would be
the best gift I could get.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.250
We always mean to,
but we never do,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.330
which leads to our least
favorite holiday tradition--

01:25.330 --> 01:26.540
disappointing abuela.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.330
I try to make up for it.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.290
Every year, I make her
a special ornament

01:30.290 --> 01:32.580
of our family
for her tree.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.500
But a special ornament
of her family on her tree

01:35.500 --> 01:38.540
isn't the same as our actual
family around her tree.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.380
Safer, but not the same.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.210
Steam them for one hour.

01:42.210 --> 01:43.670
I'm making mine tomorrow.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.500
Nobody makes pasteles
like your abuela.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.540
I know.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.460
They're the pastel-iest.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.620
So Harley...

01:49.620 --> 01:51.920
Here it comes.
The ask.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.420
Are you as cringe-y
as I am right now?

01:54.420 --> 01:57.420
Hot yoga's starting,
mijita, gotta run.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.460
She didn't even ask.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.960
Abuela's giving up on us.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.620
We have to go
to Florida!

02:08.750 --> 02:11.380
Right after urgent care.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.380
Abuela's the only person
who actually wants
our family to visit.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.420
She didn't even ask?

02:19.420 --> 02:21.170
That's bad.

02:21.170 --> 02:22.460
Next year, Florida.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.170
We've been promising
that for so long,

02:24.170 --> 02:25.580
even I'm not buying it.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.290
Now abuela's lost
faith in us.

02:27.290 --> 02:29.460
We have to show her
we still have our act together.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.210
You mean lie?

02:31.210 --> 02:34.080
You always say Christmas
is the season of believing.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.670
I believe we can do this.

02:35.670 --> 02:37.080
You must also believe

02:37.080 --> 02:38.960
that a giant money tree
just sprouted in the yard,

02:38.960 --> 02:41.790
because last-minute
plane tickets will be
a fortune, Harley.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.250
Hey, Rachel ditched us
for France.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.580
That's one less
plane ticket to buy.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.670
I know how we can
pay for the trip.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.420
Don't buy us kids the big
family gift we picked out.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.620
Huh. I guess
if you all want to...

02:55.620 --> 02:57.040
Yes!

02:59.790 --> 03:02.040
Start decking
those halls, abuela.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.080
We're coming for Christmas,
and this year, we mean it.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.500
Promise.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.420
The other kids
are good with this?

03:08.420 --> 03:11.290
You want us to give up
our pool table?!

03:14.380 --> 03:17.880
That is a ho-ho-
horrible idea.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.920
It took four months for us
to agree on the pool table

04:14.920 --> 04:17.750
as our big gift,
and now you want
us to give it up?

04:17.750 --> 04:21.580
If anyone would like
to be my new BFTF,
there's an opening.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.580
I knew we should've
went with crocodile moat.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.500
This wouldn't be
a problem.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.580
It'd be half dug by now.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.880
Classic Diaz family
over-think.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.580
I can't go to Florida.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.920
I've spent months collecting
toys for the toy drive here.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.750
Just drop them off
before we leave.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.540
Drop off.
Listen to you.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.620
The best part of the drive
is matching gift to receiver.

04:39.620 --> 04:43.420
And I don't wanna brag,
but finding the perfect
gift for each person

04:43.420 --> 04:45.210
is kind of
my super power.

04:45.210 --> 04:47.670
It's true. How do you think
we came up with the pool table?

04:49.170 --> 04:50.790
Are you eating pasteles?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.420
You gave back
our perfect gift.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.540
Maybe lose the judge-y.

04:56.540 --> 05:00.170
I feel bad we can't go,
but abuela will understand.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.880
She loves us,
even though we're us.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.500
Okay, I didn't wanna
have to tell you guys this,

05:05.500 --> 05:07.420
but when I called
her earlier,

05:09.670 --> 05:12.380
she didn't even ask

05:12.380 --> 05:14.710
if we were coming
to visit her for Christmas.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.790
What?!
No guilt trip?

05:18.790 --> 05:22.580
No "seeing you all
would be the best
gift I could get"?

05:22.580 --> 05:25.670
- 'Fraid not.
- We broke abuela.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.710
This all feels
so wrong now.

05:30.170 --> 05:33.250
Guys, no one does
the holidays like abuela.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.290
Plus, a beach Christmas?

05:35.290 --> 05:37.960
That's the best of
two seasons jammed into one.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.880
So who's with me?

05:46.170 --> 05:49.540
Beach Christmas!

05:58.830 --> 06:01.380
I made abuela
my most special ornament ever.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.750
Cool, huh?
Press the button,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.540
and let it snow.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.120
And best of all,

06:07.120 --> 06:09.830
none of these little Diazes
have to shovel it.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.790
Just gotta store it
somewhere safe.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.920
We found
the sleeper seats.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.920
Is that
the flight attendant?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.710
Order me
a cranberry juice.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.330
Guys, that's where
the luggage goes.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.080
We didn't bring luggage.
Georgie's using it.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.460
Beach vacation.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.670
Harley, all you need
is a bathing suit.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.750
You're not supposed
to be up there.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.460
Santa knows when
you're sleeping,
he knows when you're awake,

06:39.460 --> 06:41.670
and he knows when you're
annoying the entire
coach section of an airplane.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.710
Eh. We've been
so bad this year,

06:43.710 --> 06:45.750
we've already
blown it.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.170
We're usually on the coal list
by Valentine's Day.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.380
Santa's super old.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.250
He's lucky if he remembers
to put his pants on

06:52.250 --> 06:54.540
before he gets
in the sleigh.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.290
These last few days
are the only thing
he's gonna remember.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.960
Lewie, we got a do-over.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.710
We're back in the gift game.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.120
We gotta get outta here
before Santa sees.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.960
Or Dad sees. You're punished.
Get outta there.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.920
Excuse me, sir.
Don't be alarmed.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.920
I'm just using
your left shoulder as a step.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.580
He's not.
You're not.

07:13.580 --> 07:14.880
Sorry.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.830
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.880
Merry Christmas,
or whatever holiday

07:19.880 --> 07:22.750
is meaningful to
you and your family.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.880
Excuse me, miss.
You're gonna have
to check that.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.830
I can't. I already checked
five bags of toys.

07:36.830 --> 07:39.880
He's for a very special
yet-to-be determined
underprivileged child,

07:39.880 --> 07:41.920
and he can't be damaged.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.580
I'll just put him
under the seat.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.170
He looks bigger
than he is.

07:45.170 --> 07:47.500
Oh! Piece of cake.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.540
Do you like cake?
I love it.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.170
Chocolate, vanilla,
marble, black forest,
Bundt.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.380
You know what? You go ahead
and do your thing,

07:55.380 --> 07:57.580
I'll make us a list, okay?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.830
Why are you wearing my seat?

08:06.830 --> 08:10.500
It said these can
be used as flotation devices.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.170
I'm taking this
body surfing.

08:13.170 --> 08:15.170
Why don't you use
your own?

08:15.170 --> 08:18.210
We need those
in case of emergency.

08:18.210 --> 08:21.920
They're your brothers,
it's Christmas.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.460
Your brothers.
It's Christmas.

08:32.290 --> 08:35.170
Whoever's assigned to
that seat isn't going to
let Deathnee sit there.

08:35.170 --> 08:37.920
That's the point.
There's always

08:37.920 --> 08:39.790
an extra seat
on a plane.

08:39.790 --> 08:42.960
So we need to make
whoever's sitting here
want to sit over there.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.000
No one changes seats
to avoid a doll with
a bad haircut.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.040
She's the first
line of attack.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.170
Me and you are the second.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.210
Sick or crying.
Which one do you want?

08:52.210 --> 08:53.960
I'm not pretending
to be...

09:11.750 --> 09:14.290
It's too bad we couldn't
all get seats together.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.000
Yeah, but, you know,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.080
last-minute tickets,
kids can't sit in exit rows.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.620
You didn't even try,
did you?

09:20.620 --> 09:23.040
The kids are locked
in a tube with paid babysitters.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.000
We got aisle seats,
and you're gonna question this?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.920
Oh, here you go, sir.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.500
This seat is empty.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
"Welcome aboard
Where To Air.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.040
Generic greeting
welcoming passengers."

09:50.040 --> 09:51.880
Oh, shoot, I'm supposed
to fill that in.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.920
Anyway, we'll be
dashing through the skies,

09:54.920 --> 09:56.920
and reaching Florida in
two hours and 15 minutes.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.120
Look at all those
other dummies,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.540
squished together,
sharing arm rests.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.380
We are so
the smartest Diaz kids.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.080
Hello, fellow travelers,

10:14.080 --> 10:16.380
and Santa,
who might be listening.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.710
As a special gift
for this holiday season,

10:18.710 --> 10:22.120
please enjoy arm fart
"Jingle Bells,"

10:22.120 --> 10:26.880
brought to you by the one
and only Lewie and Beast Diaz.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.080
Yeah, maybe we keep
that Diaz thing to ourselves.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.080
Yeah.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.830
Feel free to sing along.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.830
Don't call
the flight attendant.

10:58.830 --> 11:00.830
Keep this between
the three of us,

11:00.830 --> 11:03.620
and these are yours.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.210
And there's more
where that came from.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.330
I'm watching
Heather's Cottage,

11:12.330 --> 11:14.330
and Lord Dalliwag
just died of consumption.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.000
Do you have a tissue?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.330
Please give me
a real challenge.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.960
The parent pouch holds all.
Harley made it.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.710
This puppy is
completely waterproof,

11:23.710 --> 11:25.920
fireproof,
and thief-proof.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.920
Thief There's
a dollar bill hanging
out of it.

11:32.330 --> 11:33.920
Stop, thief, stop, thief.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.210
Harley didn't explain
this feature.

11:36.210 --> 11:39.710
[alarm and Harley's
voice continue]

11:39.710 --> 11:41.000
Uh, do you have an eight?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.710
Hit the bricks, loser.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.500
You're supposed to say
go fish.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.960
I know.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.380
Party's over.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.040
Nice try, but I know
that routine.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.210
Even the plane's
telling you to leave.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.080
- Put your seatbelt on.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.330
"We're very sorry
to inform you,

12:05.330 --> 12:07.000
but due to storms
in our flight path,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.580
our plane is being
diverted to Columbus, Ohio."

12:09.580 --> 12:11.250
!

12:11.250 --> 12:14.040
That's nowhere near abuela.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.620
"We'll be landing soon.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.380
Express sympathy and final
pass through cabin."

12:17.380 --> 12:18.880
Shoot. Did it again.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.580
Excuse me, miss.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.500
My family has Christmas
plans in Florida.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.170
How soon till we can
get another flight?

12:28.170 --> 12:29.710
How many of you
are there?

12:29.710 --> 12:32.080
- Eight.
- We can cut
this guy loose.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.830
Well, based on
the storm and re-booking,

12:34.830 --> 12:36.620
we should probably have you
there by New Year.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.210
But we'll miss Christmas.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.040
You won't miss Christmas.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.670
You'll be having it
at the airport.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.380
Okay, we need
a plan.

12:51.380 --> 12:53.460
We are not "Christmas
at the airport" people.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.250
Exactly. Our water wings
will do us no good here.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.210
Unless they have
a fountain.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.000
Does a fountain of bad
ideas count, 'cause that's you.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Leave it to us to travel
two hours to get

13:03.000 --> 13:05.080
further away from abuela
than where we started.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.290
We'll have to wait it out
here for a few days.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.670
If we're lucky, the airport
won't run out of cinnamon buns.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.710
But we made a promise
to be there for Christmas.

13:11.710 --> 13:14.620
Abuela's going to think
this is one more time
we didn't try.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.120
And last year, we claimed
we were on our way,

13:17.120 --> 13:19.710
and got diverted,
so we used that bullet.

13:19.710 --> 13:23.460
We did? Darn.
There goes my big idea.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.420
Look, I know we're
all disappointed,

13:25.420 --> 13:27.210
but what can we do?

13:27.210 --> 13:29.120
I know one thing
you can do.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.960
Get off the plane.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.120
We landed
20 minutes ago.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.580
This isn't over, guys.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.460
Flying's not
the only way to travel.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.960
Keep your hands
to yourself.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.080
Just 20 hours to Florida.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.210
Start the car, Dad.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.250
There go the keys.
I'm just gonna
scoot the seat back.

13:55.250 --> 13:59.750
Ow! That's
my favorite leg.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.620
Sir, you must have
something bigger.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.710
Sorry. These are the last
two cars I have to rent.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.830
Holiday rush and all.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.000
We're gonna have to take
turns breathing.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.620
When I inhale,
someone exhale.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.380
What about that?
That's the perfect size for us.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.500
Some rock group
was supposed to
come pick it up,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.330
but their flight
got re-routed.

14:18.330 --> 14:21.960
You ever hear of
Pants Inferno
Me neither.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.330
But that's not
for regular drivers.
It requires a Class B license.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.210
I have one.

14:26.210 --> 14:28.380
With seven kids,
I'm always one kid away

14:28.380 --> 14:30.620
from needing a bus for
basic family transportation.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.330
I'll give you a deal on it.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.120
But if you see Pants Inferno,
play dumb.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.580
Rock star tour bus.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.250

I can't believe
I'm saying this,

16:16.250 --> 16:18.460
but I'm glad
our plane got diverted.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.500
Forget Pants Inferno.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.460
The Diaz family is rolling
like jingle bell rock stars.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.210
And we're still on track
to be at abuela's by Christmas.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.120
Stop the bus!
Deathnee's missing!

16:33.330 --> 16:36.670
Deathnee's missing?
I know you had her
at the airport.

16:36.670 --> 16:39.540
I saw the other passengers
recoiling as you walked
off the plane.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.750
And I got stuck with Lewie
and Beast in my rental car,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.120
'cause Deathnee needed
room to spread.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.460
I can track her
on my phone.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.120
I planted a microchip
after that day we spent

16:48.120 --> 16:50.040
digging up the backyard
because Daphne forgot

16:50.040 --> 16:53.120
where she buried
her alive.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.880
So, where is she?

16:54.880 --> 16:58.250
Relax. She's only...

16:58.250 --> 17:00.330
sixty miles away.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.710
Moving in
the opposite direction?

17:03.710 --> 17:05.500
We left her in
the rental car.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.000
- Oh!
!

17:08.000 --> 17:11.120
All right, everyone,
just like we practiced.

17:11.120 --> 17:14.750
No sudden movements.
Back away slowly.

17:14.750 --> 17:18.380
Don't panic. We lost
Deathnee, but we have eyes on.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.420
My chip has an RF signal

17:20.420 --> 17:22.040
that will pinpoint
her exact location.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.960
I've never been so glad
you're a nerd.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.420
How on earth did we
leave her in the rental car?

17:32.420 --> 17:35.170
Oh, this happened because
you were all too distracted.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.540
That's it.
Devices here.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.170
- Come on.
- Nope.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.380
- But--
- Nope.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.120
Put these in
your man-purse.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.460
It's called
a parent pouch.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.920
I'll also accept
dad bag.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.960
Call it what you want.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.540
Deathnee's on the loose.
Let's go.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.580
I don't wanna make
another stop.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.420
I've been holding in
my pee since we left,

17:56.420 --> 17:58.620
just so I can
go in the ocean.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.710
Me, too.
Press on.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.460
Great. I'll let Santa know
you chose ocean pee

18:03.460 --> 18:05.120
over your sister's
favorite doll.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.040
Dad, turn
this thing around.

18:10.040 --> 18:14.380
What kind of lunatic
would drive 30 miles
on unpaved road?

18:14.380 --> 18:17.170
Maybe Deathnee ditched
the family and she's
at the wheel.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.880
I picked the wrong year
to make abuela a glass ornament.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.210
We're approaching
a campground.

18:22.210 --> 18:24.420
According to this,
Deathnee should be right here.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.460
Tom, stop the bus.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.000
Okay, kids, let me
and your mom go over there.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.080
Uh, too late.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.670
Play time's over.
Give it, girl.

18:42.670 --> 18:46.500
Her name is Joya,
and she doesn't want
to give you the doll.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.580
You've got two seconds
before I get all up
in that.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.460
Sorry. It's just that
Deathnee's more than a doll.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.750
She's my daughter's
best friend.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.460
Her only friend.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.620
She's not that nice.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.290
I don't know who you are,
or how you found us,

19:03.290 --> 19:06.460
or what strange family band
you're fronting.

19:09.210 --> 19:11.790
We are trying to enjoy
our annual holiday trip,

19:11.790 --> 19:13.920
and frankly,
this feels aggressive.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.120
Oh, I'll show you
aggressive.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.710
Whoa, whoa.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.250
Merry Christmas.
I just saved you
a tetanus shot.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.250
Hang on. What if Joya
gets a different doll?

19:24.250 --> 19:25.670
I've got a whole bunch
for the toy drive.

19:25.670 --> 19:26.830
She could just pick one.

19:26.830 --> 19:30.120
No. She's mine!
I love her.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.620
It's the only doll
she's ever liked.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.500
She's the only doll
I ever liked.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.330
He's got two seconds before
I'm all up in that.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.880
I'll give you three
suitcases of toys for Deathnee.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.170
But, Georgie, that's
your entire toy drive.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.920
You've been collecting
that for months.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.670
Yeah, but, what I love
most about the toy drive

19:58.670 --> 20:01.290
is matching people
to the perfect gift.

20:05.710 --> 20:09.500
And Deathnee
is your perfect gift.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.880
Yay!

20:16.500 --> 20:18.290
Campfire smoke?

20:18.290 --> 20:20.880
It's called
emotion, Harley.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.960
Did you not see
what just happened here?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.540
You're a good
big sister.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.710
But what about
your toy drive?

20:34.710 --> 20:37.080
I'll have to get
more toys.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.750
Not sure how,

20:38.750 --> 20:41.170
but Christmas is
the season of believing, right?

20:41.170 --> 20:43.080
Hey, look, a penny.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.830
Face up.
It's good luck.

20:44.830 --> 20:48.250
And we could use some...

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
...luck.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.500
It's possible I forgot
to zip the pouch.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.580
Ironically, the only thing
that didn't slip out of
Dad's hand was this.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.460
This is what I put on
the parent pouch

21:15.460 --> 21:17.210
to keep thieves
from bragging it.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.750
Yeah, my whoopsy daisy
slippery spray-sies.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.790
Yeah, that's more fun to say
when I'm not this upset.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.460
I just hope Santa
doesn't think this
was our fault.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.750
Yeah. This has Lewie
and Beast written
all over it.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.960
No, even you guys haven't
destroyed this much

21:32.960 --> 21:34.710
this fast.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.580
Guys, enough with
the faces.

21:39.580 --> 21:42.790
I got Deathnee back.
This is all that matters.

21:42.790 --> 21:45.580
And I thought
you and that doll

21:45.580 --> 21:48.710
- couldn't get
any weirder.

21:48.710 --> 21:51.290
Daphne was right.
What matters at the holidays

21:51.290 --> 21:53.080
is being with
the ones you love.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.460
All our valuables were
melted into a doorstop,

21:55.460 --> 21:57.460
but there was
just enough gas

21:57.460 --> 21:59.120
to make it to abuela's
like we promised.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.380
Who's ready for
the best beach Christmas ever?

22:01.380 --> 22:05.080
Road trip, road trip,
road trip!

22:05.080 --> 22:07.250
And then it happened.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.790
My worst nightmare.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.500
I'm gonna need to update
my worst nightmare list.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.290
Okay, so we have no food,
no money,

22:47.290 --> 22:48.830
no credit cards,
and no phones.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.210
But at least we made it
to a repair shop

22:51.210 --> 22:52.790
before the bus broke down.

22:52.790 --> 22:54.250
That's pretty lucky.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.670
I'd feel luckier
if I wasn't carrying

22:56.670 --> 22:58.080
the transmission
in a beach bag.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.830
I know Christmas
is about believing,

23:00.830 --> 23:02.790
but right now, it's
kinda hard to believe

23:02.790 --> 23:04.250
we have any chance
to make it to abuela's.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.790
If we can get
the repairs done by tonight,

23:06.790 --> 23:09.080
we can drive straight
through and still make it
for Christmas Eve.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.670
Buddy Burtz.
Saw you pull up.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.830
Your rock and roll bus
is a whole lotta rock,

23:14.830 --> 23:16.420
and very little roll.

23:16.420 --> 23:19.750
Buddy, can you be a buddy
and fix it by Christmas?

23:19.750 --> 23:21.330
Sure.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.920
Just not this Christmas.

23:27.580 --> 23:31.380
I think I've established myself
as the expert on giving up,

23:31.380 --> 23:34.460
and in my expert opinion,
it's time to call it.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.250
Hey, this family
does not give up.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.290
Mess up, yes.
Give up, no.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.460
Harley, let's be honest.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.290
We could've already
called this game on
account of storm.

23:43.290 --> 23:46.790
Fire, doll-napping.
Wow, this has been
a terrible trip.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.920
I mean, it's not like
abuela will be alone.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.040
Uncle Jake's family
goes every year.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.460
We all want abuela to think
we have it together,

23:53.460 --> 23:57.250
but this scorched ball
of everything we own
says otherwise.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.830
- Yeah. And my video game...

23:59.830 --> 24:01.960
is way less fun
this way.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.580
One of the phones
is working.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.250
Probably a telemarketer.
Don't answer.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.790
It's abuela.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.540
What do we do? I...

24:13.540 --> 24:14.880
Tell her we can't make it.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.750
I'll lean away
so I'm not part of that.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.210
Me

24:18.210 --> 24:20.420
You've established yourself
as the leader,

24:20.420 --> 24:23.330
so lead abuela
to disappointment.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.920
Abuela, hi.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.330
My Harley.
I just realized

24:32.330 --> 24:35.330
this is the first year
I'll get my special ornament

24:35.330 --> 24:38.420
delivered by you,
not the mailman.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.580
Well, that...

24:41.580 --> 24:43.330
I'm really sorry--

24:43.330 --> 24:44.920
Don't apologize.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.710
Your timing is perfect.
Uncle Jake just called.

24:47.710 --> 24:49.790
His whole family
is down with the flu.

24:49.790 --> 24:54.120
Without you all, I'd be
spending Christmas alone.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.920
So when do I see
mis preciosos?

24:55.920 --> 24:57.790
Hang on. Ethan has
something he wants to say.

24:57.790 --> 25:00.500
Abuela!

25:00.500 --> 25:03.460
Papi! I hope
you brought your guitar.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.790
I told my aqua aerobics
class you would play.

25:05.790 --> 25:07.420
Acoustic, though.
We are in the water.

25:07.420 --> 25:10.040
Oops. Georgie's
grabbing the phone.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.830
My athlete.
Exciting news.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.920
I signed us up for
a pickle ball tournament.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.380
How's your smack talk?

25:16.380 --> 25:18.580
I... I, um...

25:18.580 --> 25:21.080
Needs some work. I'll coach
you when you get here.

25:23.210 --> 25:24.500
My babies!

25:24.500 --> 25:26.170
When do you arrive?

25:26.170 --> 25:27.790
Uh...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.420
Abuela, we can't...

25:33.420 --> 25:36.580
- tell you when.
- Oh!

25:36.580 --> 25:38.580
We want it to be
a surprise when we get there.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.880
Can't wait.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.500
A surprise
if we get there.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.040
And then our plane
got diverted,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.580
and our stuff
fell in the fire,

25:50.580 --> 25:52.080
and the ornament I made
got smashed.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.420
You ever try squeezing
nine figurines

25:54.420 --> 25:56.420
into an ornament that...
never mind.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.420
Let's just say
this trip hasn't been great.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.210
But you can turn it around,
so what do you say?

26:05.670 --> 26:07.750
Buddy, you can lie there
and ignore me,

26:07.750 --> 26:09.500
but I'm not leaving
till you fix this bus.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.710
Hey, thanks.
You found my boots.

26:15.330 --> 26:17.380
I've been sportin'
my spiffy Christmas socks.

26:17.380 --> 26:20.000
I gotta show 'em off.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.040
Hey, I found your boots,
you fix our bus.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.420
Look at us,
working together.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.920
Wish I could.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.120
We're full up.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.920
Vehicles break down
left and right
this time of year.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.920
Know why Santa
uses a sleigh?

26:36.920 --> 26:39.420
Car's in the shop.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.500
I find humor helps
when I'm stressed.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.460
An elf, a reindeer,
and a snowman

26:44.460 --> 26:46.380
walk into
Santa's workshop.

26:46.380 --> 26:49.580
Funny. So, about the bus.

26:49.580 --> 26:51.170
I don't know if
you're familiar with jokes,

26:51.170 --> 26:53.170
but that's what we
call the set-up.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.620
Good to know.

26:55.620 --> 26:57.330
Like I was saying,
we're trying to get to
our abuela's for the holiday,

26:57.330 --> 26:58.580
and you're
our only hope.

26:58.580 --> 27:01.040
You folks seem
like nice people.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.920
Problem is, it's just
yours truly on duty.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.000
My brothers
are training for the Iron Elf.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.330
Iron Elf.

27:10.330 --> 27:13.120
Uh, that one
wasn't a joke.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.000
You really don't
get comedy, do you?

27:17.750 --> 27:19.710
The Iron Elf
is a Christmas
relay race

27:19.710 --> 27:21.710
that's been run
in this town for years.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.040
My whole family does it.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.790
And you don't want to?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.420
Oh, I do.
More than anything.

27:28.420 --> 27:30.330
And they let me once,
years ago,

27:30.330 --> 27:32.040
but I messed up.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.460
After that,
they gave my spot

27:33.460 --> 27:34.960
to someone
they could count on.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.790
He may be
outside the family,

27:36.790 --> 27:40.330
but Mailman Frank
does show up every day.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.000
Guy's rain or shine.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.960
Uh, no ding on the awesomeness
of Mailman Frank,

27:45.960 --> 27:47.580
but your brothers
seem like jerks.

27:47.580 --> 27:50.210
Nah. Just competitive.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.620
It's fine.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.960
I'm good.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.330
Big family.

27:55.330 --> 27:57.920
Used to bein' overlooked.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.330
You know.

27:59.330 --> 28:02.330
Actually, yeah.
I do.

28:03.710 --> 28:05.620
Middle kid of seven.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.960
Sometimes I feel like
the Wednesday of the family.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.500
You know, that day
no one really notices.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.920
I like that.
Wednesday.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.250
I'm a Wednesday
in a family of Fridays.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.880
I will pay you double
if you fix our bus first.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.500
My family is at
the bank right now.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.210
I guess I could do that
for a fellow Wednesday.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.460
Oh!

28:35.120 --> 28:37.830
Well, consider yourselves
lucky.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.620
You squeaked in
just before I locked up.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.000
If you'll just slide
your card through the reader.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.170
Of course.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.460
We had a little mishap.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.420
Makes it easier to find
the card in my purse though.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.380
Looks like
the card reader's broken.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.120
It's okay though.
You can just give us the money.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.210
Look, you have no ID,

29:14.210 --> 29:16.710
no functioning bank card,

29:16.710 --> 29:20.920
and you expect me to
just hand over some cash?

29:20.920 --> 29:24.420
I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to
come back after the holidays

29:24.420 --> 29:27.420
with proper ID.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.460
Please don't forget
your blob.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.540
Ma'am, if I may.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.790
What are your plans
for the holidays?

29:35.790 --> 29:38.540
You mean after
this conversation?

29:38.540 --> 29:41.210
My family is coming
over tomorrow night.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.120
I'm cooking a ham.

29:43.120 --> 29:48.170
Have you ever been on
a disastrous holiday
road trip?

29:48.170 --> 29:51.830
The kind that's
so emotionally trying,

29:51.830 --> 29:53.500
it eats your soul.

29:53.500 --> 29:57.040
Makes you wonder
if Santa himself
is testing you,

29:57.040 --> 29:59.330
but... you keep going,

29:59.330 --> 30:02.290
because you know that
somewhere, your loved one

30:02.290 --> 30:05.880
is waiting with
open arms.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.120
Yes.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.540
My brother Ted.
He lives in Abilene,

30:11.540 --> 30:14.210
and I haven't seen him
in over three years.

30:14.210 --> 30:17.330
Christmas just
isn't the same.

30:17.330 --> 30:19.380
You know what?

30:19.380 --> 30:22.250
I'm gonna call Corporate.
We're gonna work this out.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.120
Here's a withdrawal slip.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.120
Just write in
what you need, okay?

30:27.120 --> 30:29.830
Freeze! Nobody move!

30:29.830 --> 30:32.920
Hey, they said the magazines
from the airplane
were complimentary.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.830
Somebody triggered
the silent alarm.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.120
Well, it wasn't me.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.250
How would I know?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.040
I see a button,
I push it.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.670
It's who I am.

30:50.670 --> 30:53.120
We'll just take the cash
and get outta your hair.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.460
Twenties are fine.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.790
Sorry, but without money,
it's no can do.

31:03.790 --> 31:05.380
My brothers have
this crazy rule

31:05.380 --> 31:07.580
about workin' for free--
don't do it.

31:07.580 --> 31:10.000
Better being ignored
than yelled at.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.750
We'll work off
the bill.

31:11.750 --> 31:14.170
Wash the floors,
organize the tools.

31:14.170 --> 31:16.170
I once alphabetized
all the food in our kitchen.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.210
I could do
your box of donuts.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.000
Chocolate, cruller,
crumb.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.830
Wait.

31:21.830 --> 31:25.170
He said he'd rather
be ignored than yelled at.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.000
That's middle-kid speak.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.460
And being one myself,

31:28.460 --> 31:31.920
I know what every
overlooked middle kid wants.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.670
- To be appreciated.
- Maple claw...

31:34.670 --> 31:37.330
What if we helped you
prove yourself to your family?

31:37.330 --> 31:40.330
You can't help me
find a girlfriend.

31:40.330 --> 31:43.330
Not this time of year.
People have shopping to do.

31:43.330 --> 31:45.380
By running that race
your brothers won't let you do.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.790
That'll be tough
without a team.

31:49.290 --> 31:52.120
You've got one.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.710
We win that race,
you fix our bus.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.540
You know
my sweet spot, Wednesday.

32:14.380 --> 32:16.210
Um... Buddy.

32:16.210 --> 32:19.380
Maybe you could've mentioned
that the Iron Elf

32:19.380 --> 32:21.380
is more circus act
than race.

32:21.380 --> 32:23.710
What? No.
It's a race.

32:23.710 --> 32:26.790
With a high wire
and a trapeze and...

32:26.790 --> 32:31.330
Huh. How did I not
see that before?

32:31.330 --> 32:33.620
Uh, speaking of circus,

32:33.620 --> 32:37.460
here come the clowns.
My brothers.

32:37.460 --> 32:41.250
It's not as bad
as it sounds;
I like clowns.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.790
What brings
you here, Buddy?

32:42.790 --> 32:44.960
Oh, did you lock
yourself out again?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.210
At least this time,
you've got your boots.

32:47.210 --> 32:50.250
I'm here for the same
reason you are, Benny.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.290
To win the Iron Elf.

32:52.290 --> 32:54.210
Well, with what team?

32:54.210 --> 32:56.000
My family.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.460
They asked me.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.380
Really?

32:59.380 --> 33:00.460
Well, all right then.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.880
Good luck.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.750
You're gonna need it
after what he did

33:04.750 --> 33:06.290
last time
on this course.

33:06.290 --> 33:09.040
We know what he did,
and we don't care.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.920
What did you do?
Not that we care.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.880
It's not what I did;
it's what I didn't do.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.460
Finish my event.
It was called...

33:17.460 --> 33:19.750
the leap of faith.

33:19.750 --> 33:23.460
All I had to do
was jump from a platform

33:23.460 --> 33:25.540
to a trapeze bar.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.080
Don't be a loser, Buddy.
Jump!

33:28.080 --> 33:29.750
My knees
turned to jelly.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.330
The only thing that kept me
from peeing myself

33:32.330 --> 33:34.380
was the folks
standing below.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.290
We lost the race

33:37.330 --> 33:38.920
Hey, do we have
to win this thing,

33:38.920 --> 33:41.000
or does
participation count?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.040
If we get
points for injuries,
we might stand a chance.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.330
Okay, yes,
the course is high.

33:45.330 --> 33:47.330
And yes, the others
are more prepared.

33:47.330 --> 33:50.830
But the Diazes
never prepare for anything.

33:50.830 --> 33:53.540
Flying by the seat of our pants
is what we do best,

33:53.540 --> 33:56.540
and here, we're literally
flying by the seat of our pants.

33:56.540 --> 33:59.620
Winning this is the only thing
standing between us

33:59.620 --> 34:01.750
and our family Christmas.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.790
So let's do this,
because our name isn't Di-no.

34:04.790 --> 34:07.040
It's Di-yes!

34:07.040 --> 34:11.330
Di-yes, Di-yes,
Di-yes, Di-yes.

34:11.330 --> 34:14.420
I'm not technically a Diaz,

34:14.420 --> 34:16.750
but the speech
really got me.

34:16.750 --> 34:23.170
Welcome to the 23rd
annual Iron Elf competition.

34:23.170 --> 34:25.750
So nice to see
everyone here.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.710
Well, almost everyone.

34:30.040 --> 34:34.500
We have four teams
of Santa's helpers competing.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.380
One team member
must complete each event

34:38.380 --> 34:42.120
in order to get a gift
to put in Santa's sleigh.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.460
When all three gifts
are wrapped,

34:44.460 --> 34:45.830
and put in the sleigh,

34:45.830 --> 34:49.380
the first team to get
from the starting line

34:49.380 --> 34:53.210
to the finish line
will be crowned

34:53.210 --> 34:57.750
Iron Elf champions!

34:59.580 --> 35:03.460
So the race begins
at sundown, teams.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.000
Enjoy a complimentary
glass of eggnog,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.420
and a slice of Kringle,
and then suit up,

35:09.420 --> 35:14.710
because you're about to begin
the race of your life!

35:17.000 --> 35:20.290
Okay, Kringle!

35:20.290 --> 35:23.420
Okay, Buddy, you're
doing the leap of faith.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.880
- But that's the one
I couldn't--
- I know.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.750
But today's the day you show
your family who you really are.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.580
I have faith in you.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.500
Christmas is the season
of believing.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.250
Thanks, kid.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.170
Champions,
take your sleighs.

35:43.170 --> 35:46.960
Iron Elves,
are you ready?

35:46.960 --> 35:50.250
Hey. May the best elves win.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.500
Oh, we will.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.580
I didn't squeeze into
this reindeer suit to lose.

35:55.790 --> 35:57.670
Speaking of which.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.420
What?!

36:05.120 --> 36:08.380
So it's easy for
everyone to see the winners.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.880
On your marks.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.540
Get set.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.750
- Yeah!

36:20.540 --> 36:23.620
Yes, Lewie.
Go, Ethan, to the swing.

36:23.620 --> 36:25.880
Let's go.
Come on.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.620
Lewie and Beast,
come on, guys.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.290
Three Santas
in the chimney,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.580
then we grab our gift
for Santa's sleigh.

36:33.580 --> 36:37.080
It's okay, Beast.
He knows it's part of the game.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.960
- Okay.
- Throw it.

36:41.750 --> 36:44.040
- Come on!

36:44.040 --> 36:46.380
You're gonna box out
a kid with Santa on Christmas?

36:46.380 --> 36:49.500
Beast, go around them like
you're going for the last
piece of bacon.

36:51.500 --> 36:55.170
I know you can
do it, Beast.
- Yes!

36:59.830 --> 37:04.210
Yeah! Stuck
the landing, Santa!

37:04.210 --> 37:06.500
Get ready, Georgie.
Those challenge gifts
are coming your way.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
You wrap them,
I'll put 'em in here.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.710
I've been coached by
a lot of people.
Never a reindeer.

37:11.710 --> 37:13.540
We have to win this thing
if we want our bus fixed,

37:13.540 --> 37:15.330
so stay on your toes.

37:15.330 --> 37:18.330
Come on, Ethan, swing.
It's a swing.

37:18.330 --> 37:21.620
You have to get
three ornaments
on the tree.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.790
It's okay,
it's okay.

37:22.790 --> 37:25.540
You can do it, Ethan.

37:25.540 --> 37:28.040
Yes! Yes!
Whoo hoo!

37:28.040 --> 37:31.250
You got this.
Come on, Ethan.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.620
Oh! Oh!
It's okay.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.790
- Just one more.
- Ethan's blowing it.

37:36.790 --> 37:41.420
Come on, Ethan.
Do you wanna be stuck
in this Podunk town forever?

37:44.790 --> 37:46.210
Yes! Yes!

37:47.710 --> 37:49.580
Whoo hoo, we won!
We won.

37:49.580 --> 37:51.750
We won, Ethan. Go!

37:51.750 --> 37:54.710
The Diazes have claimed
their first victory,

37:54.710 --> 37:57.420
although clearly, they
have never experienced

37:57.420 --> 38:00.250
the joy of our Thursdays
farmers market.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.790
Sorry. Had to motivate him.

38:02.790 --> 38:04.250
Sounds adorable.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.540
- Here's the first gift. Hurry.
- Go, go, go.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.460
What are you doing?

38:10.460 --> 38:12.080
Do you want it done quick
or do you want it done right?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.620
- Quick, quick.
- Okay, going into
toy drive mode.

38:16.620 --> 38:17.960
Come on, Beast,
just one more.

38:21.670 --> 38:23.420
- Go, Beast!
- Come on, Beast,
you got this.

38:23.420 --> 38:28.960
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

38:28.960 --> 38:31.750
- Yeah!
- Oh!

38:31.750 --> 38:35.420
That's three. Thank you,
delicious crispy bacon.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.620
And you always say
don't fight over food.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.330
Thank you for
not listening.

38:39.330 --> 38:41.580
Oh, I gotta run this
over to Georgie.

38:43.670 --> 38:44.880
Here's the second gift.

38:44.880 --> 38:48.080
Stand back.
You might get a paper cut.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.620
Go, go, go!

38:49.620 --> 38:52.620
Yeah!
The winner!

38:55.620 --> 38:57.580
One gift left
before the reindeer run.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.210
Who are we waiting on?

39:00.750 --> 39:02.620
Buddy.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.830
I can't.

39:11.830 --> 39:13.920
That's what I love
about Christmas.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.580
Tradition.

39:20.830 --> 39:22.330
I can't.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.710
Don't be a loser, Buddy.

39:25.710 --> 39:27.080
Jump!

39:29.710 --> 39:32.880
Buddy, show them
who you are.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.710
I have faith in you.

39:34.710 --> 39:37.170
Christmas is
the season of believing.

39:45.750 --> 39:46.880
Whoo!

39:46.880 --> 39:48.210
Yes!

39:54.540 --> 39:55.750
Well...

39:57.000 --> 40:01.170
The first elves
have all three gifts.

40:01.170 --> 40:03.920
They are off to
the Reindeer Run.

40:03.920 --> 40:07.880
You have cleats on your shoes
to help you push.
That's cheating.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.750
Hey, check it out.
First timer's trying to
tell us what's what.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.880
May I quote from
the Iron Elf rule book?

40:13.880 --> 40:16.750
First sleigh over
the finish line wins.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.920
Doesn't say how.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.210
Fa-la-later.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.790
Go, go, go.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.000
Oh, they're a lot
stronger than us.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.710
There's no way
we can catch 'em.

40:28.710 --> 40:31.500
Inventors can do anything,
including repurpose.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.710
Dad, hand me
my slippery spray.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.750
Let's go, let's go!

40:40.750 --> 40:44.120
- Come on.
- Go, go, go!

40:44.120 --> 40:47.330
Looks like the Burtzes
are out in front.

40:47.330 --> 40:48.750
Who is gonna
get to Santa first?

40:48.750 --> 40:50.750
Go, go, go.
Come on, come on.

40:52.330 --> 40:53.540
Come on, come on.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.830
Fa-la-later

41:18.080 --> 41:20.960
Diaz, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz!

41:20.960 --> 41:23.380
Diaz family wins

41:23.380 --> 41:27.580
the Iron Elf!

41:29.540 --> 41:32.830
The winners get all the gifts
in Santa's village.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.420
Hang on.
That's a lot of gifts.

41:35.420 --> 41:38.750
More than I had for
my original toy drive.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.750
You know, the one for
really needy kids.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.830
Oh. This is awkward.

41:54.830 --> 41:56.710
As team captain,

41:56.710 --> 41:58.920
I'm giving this
to the MVP.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.080
Oh, ho ho ho!

42:01.080 --> 42:03.830
This is the best Christmas
gift I ever got.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.000
Normally, I like to match
the person to the gift,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.670
but I can't stay.
You've got this.

42:13.670 --> 42:15.790
If you're gonna get to
Florida by Christmas Eve,

42:15.790 --> 42:17.080
we better get
that bus fixed.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.580
It's gonna take me
all night.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.790
Not if you have
some help.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.380
These people
gave you a chance.

42:24.380 --> 42:27.250
We should have, too.

42:27.250 --> 42:29.750
You were great out there.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.580
Thanks.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.580
We better skedaddle.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.960
This family has
an abuela to get to.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.540
Okay.

42:39.540 --> 42:42.120
Thanks for
believin' in me.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.670
Merry Christmas, Buddy.

42:43.670 --> 42:45.170
Merry Christmas, Harley.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.420
'Twas the day
before Christmas,

42:50.420 --> 42:52.380
when all through
the bus,

42:52.380 --> 42:54.670
not a Diaz was stirring,
not even--

42:54.670 --> 42:56.250
Wake up, kids.
We're here.

42:56.250 --> 43:00.000
Shake those sugarplums
out of your heads.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.170
Abuela's waiting,
and no one does Christmas

43:02.170 --> 43:04.540
- like she does.
- Whoo!

43:06.880 --> 43:08.420
Harley.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.920
Thanks.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.670
For what?

43:11.670 --> 43:13.670
For always pushing us
to try harder,

43:13.670 --> 43:16.120
do more, be better.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.750
And for always
being Di-yes!

43:52.500 --> 43:55.540
I'm so happy you made it.

43:55.540 --> 43:59.040
I've spent the whole week
getting ready.

44:00.750 --> 44:02.500
Totally.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.290
I see some red and green
in that dish towel.

44:04.290 --> 44:05.920
Super festive.

44:10.420 --> 44:12.960
You came all this way.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.500
You think I'm gonna
celebrate in a tiny condo?

44:15.500 --> 44:18.170
There's a reason I got
an extra storage shed

44:18.170 --> 44:19.960
for Christmas decorations.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.210
It wasn't the trip
we planned.

44:54.210 --> 44:56.830
It was better.

44:56.830 --> 45:00.080
Abuela believes
in us again.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.290
But to get here,

45:02.290 --> 45:06.250
we needed to believe
in ourselves.
