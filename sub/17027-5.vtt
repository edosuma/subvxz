00:01.502 --> 00:04.705
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.738 --> 00:08.309
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
and by the time I got here,

00:11.779 --> 00:16.050
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.486
I hid who I really was

00:18.519 --> 00:22.656
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.127
To most people
I'm a reporter
at Catco Worldwide Media.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.563
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.597 --> 00:31.532
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.565 --> 00:34.235
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.206
I am Supergirl.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.808
KARA: Previously on Supergirl.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.743
So our mystery alien
is from Daxam.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.844
It's a sister world
to Krypton.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.346
My name is Mon-El.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.149
I asked the DEO
to release you
into my custody.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.583
I'm in your hands, Kara.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.822
It's your first day of work!

00:54.855 --> 00:56.257
-No.
-Yes!

00:58.159 --> 01:00.194
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

01:07.568 --> 01:08.569
Thank you.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.106
Do you want syrup...

01:19.747 --> 01:21.549
-Uh...
-Looks good.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.488
Mm-mm.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.459
How is it?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.328
It fits! That's perfect.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.629
-Yeah?
-Yes, now you just
need glasses.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.266
No. I...
I have got that covered,
thank you.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.201
No, no, no, no.
Like real glasses,
like mine.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.403
Well, they're not real.
But, they keep it

01:42.436 --> 01:44.205
so that no one knows
I'm Supergirl.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.340
I'm pretty sure
no one's gonna mistake me
for Supergirl.

01:46.374 --> 01:50.544
No, no, but maybe someday
you will want to help people
the way I do.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.314
In which case,
these will come in handy.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.583
So no one knows
Mon-El is Mike.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.486
-And who's Mike?
-You are, Mike Matthews.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.354
Uh, Winn got you
a birth certificate,

02:00.388 --> 02:01.889
Social Security card
and everything.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.725
Oh, four-nine-eight,
zero-zero,
three-one-four-five.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.561
And oh...
Oh, soon you will get
your FICO score.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.698
Oh. I don't know
what any of those words mean.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.900
It's okay.
You'll learn about it
working at Catco.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.602
-Um... Great?
-(SIGHS)

02:14.635 --> 02:19.207
-Thank you for helping me
be more... Human.
-Yeah.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.275
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.877
These definitely say
"Mike" to me.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.279
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.548
So, when I first started
working here,

02:27.581 --> 02:29.250
I found it helpful
to bring coffee

02:29.283 --> 02:31.452
to the other assistants
to make new friends.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.721
Ah, bribery, got it.
We have that on Daxam.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.390
No, it's not bribery,
it's just niceness.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.791
-Hi.
-Good morning.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.627
-Good morning. Good morning.
-(TELEPHONES RINGING)

02:39.660 --> 02:41.529
What... Wait,
what are those alarms for?

02:41.562 --> 02:44.198
No, no.
They're not alarms, come here.
That's a phone.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.768
You pick it up and you say,
"Hello, this is Catco,
how may I help you?"

02:47.801 --> 02:50.604
Oh, you definitely
want to give
Eve Teschmacher a coffee.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.441
She is James' assistant,
the big boss.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.444
Eve,
have you met our new intern?

02:58.512 --> 03:01.782
-Uh, thank you so much!
-Sure.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.785
-What's your name?
-Mike. Number 49800...

03:04.818 --> 03:08.422
(LAUGHS) No, no, Mike.
You don't need to give her
your social security number.

03:08.456 --> 03:11.792
-So I memorized that fake ID
for nothing?
-You mean your real ID?

03:14.562 --> 03:15.963
Yes.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.798
Hi... Mike...

03:17.831 --> 03:22.703
Oh, James.
I want to introduce you
to our new intern... Mike.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.607
Right, Mike.
Welcome to Catco.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.477
-You're...
You're the big boss?
-That I am.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.979
Huh.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.916
-I kind of expected someone
a little more intimidating.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

03:35.949 --> 03:38.386
I had Miss Teschmacher
put some reports on your desk

03:38.419 --> 03:39.853
that should be put in order
and filed.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.290
So, if you have any questions,
my doors are always open.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.691
Oh, thanks.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.627
And hey,
sorry I ran out of
bribery coffees.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.799
That's okay,
I'm actually about to go
get one myself. So...

03:51.832 --> 03:54.335
-Can I go with you?
-Of course you can.
I'll be at the elevator.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.305
-Okay.
-Bye, now.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.441
Why would you take
the elevator?

04:00.474 --> 04:01.842
-It'd be so much quicker to
just fly from floor to floor.
-Mon-El!

04:01.875 --> 04:03.977
-"Mike."
-Mike.

04:04.011 --> 04:08.015
Mike, I told you a million
times, you are never to show
your powers to anyone else.

04:08.048 --> 04:11.419
That's the whole point
of the clothes
and the glasses.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
This is your desk.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.323
Wait, so you're saying
I can't use my powers

04:15.356 --> 04:19.560
-to go through this giant pile
of boring paper?
-No, of course not.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.331
And you're telling me that
you've never used your powers
to do these menial tasks?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.799
(SCOFFS) Never.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.369
No. Not once.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.072
You know you get this
little... This little crinkle
right up there when you lie?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.741
I don't have a crinkle.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.643
-Yeah, you're crinkling
right now.
-I don't have a crinkle.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.511
-You're crinkling
at the moment.
-(TELEPHONE RINGS)

04:37.545 --> 04:40.280
It's your first phone call.
Think you can handle it?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.282
Yeah.

04:42.316 --> 04:46.620
-Hello, this is Catco.
How may I help you?
-(TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

04:53.627 --> 04:54.928
Oh!

04:54.962 --> 04:56.764
I don't get the chance
to win my money back?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.833
Uh, with the rate
that you play,
we'd be here for hours.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.403
Your girlfriend would have to
put out an APB.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.572
Not likely.
We broke up.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.475
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
What... What happened?

05:07.508 --> 05:10.644
-She dumped me.
-She dumped you?

05:10.678 --> 05:14.382
-Who would do that?
-She did. Convincingly.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.116
Maybe it was just a fight?

05:16.149 --> 05:20.788
Well, she said I was
hard-headed, insensitive,
obsessed with work...

05:20.821 --> 05:22.189
That's not so bad.

05:22.222 --> 05:26.527
Also borderline sociopathic,
and she never wants
to see me again.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.362
So, I'm pretty sure it's over.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.131
Well, her loss.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.702
I just thought...
You know, she was...
(SIGHS)

05:35.569 --> 05:37.104
Thought she was what?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.006
Look, I appreciate
the beer and pool,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.575
but I think I need to go home
and drink something
a little harder

05:41.609 --> 05:43.711
and lose my cool.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.747
See you later.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.816
Okay. Feel better.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.824
Hey, thanks again
for taking in Mon-El.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.626
You make him sound
like some sort of stray puppy.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.128
He is.
He's an outer space
stray puppy.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.663
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

06:02.696 --> 06:04.598
I gotta admit,
I'm a little jealous of him.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.634
You know,
everything is so brand new
and exciting.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.502
I mean, yeah,
he's got a lot
to learn though.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.704
But he does have me
to guide him.

06:10.738 --> 06:14.174
He will be an Earthling
in no time.
Way faster than I was.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.677
-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-Whoa!

06:17.911 --> 06:20.648
-That was close.
-Yeah, for their car.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.955
Seriously?
Right in front of Supergirl?
I almost feel bad for them.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.524
(ALARM RINGING)

06:37.631 --> 06:40.868
You do know those bullets
aren't going to work on me,
right?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.170
I'm glad
I didn't bring any bullets.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.872
(GUN WHIRRING)

06:54.548 --> 06:57.518

-(CAMERA SMASHES)

07:36.724 --> 07:39.727
-James! James, are you okay?
-Yeah.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.632
-(SIRENS WAILING)
-Oh, no. Your dad's camera.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.933
Who were those guys?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.545
-Any of these look familiar?
-That one.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.946
That's the gun
he was carrying.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.849
Okay. That is
an Anndrannian
Photon Cannon.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.852
How'd these guys get their
hands on alien technology?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.987
Are you sure
they weren't Anndrannian?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.956
Well,
they weren't purple with fins,

08:08.989 --> 08:09.823
so yeah, I'm sure.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.258
Oh, you are lucky
this thing hit you

08:11.291 --> 08:12.860
before it was fully charged.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.528
There's no telling what this
might've done to you.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.996
We've got to find a way
to track these weapons.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.031
So it emits
phased muon particles.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.534
I could maybe come up
with a way to detect it.

08:21.935 --> 08:22.903
You were warned.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.839
The alien invaders
are dangerous.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.875
Their intentions, malicious.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.277
They possess power
we cannot hope to match.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.280
And their technology,
brought from other worlds,

08:33.313 --> 08:35.683
is falling into
the wrong hands.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.785
We should not be opening
our arms to them.

08:37.818 --> 08:41.321
We should be locking them up
and taking their weapons away.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.690
You did not heed us,

08:42.723 --> 08:46.894
but you will heed the chaos
that amnesty has brought.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.897
You will pay the price
in fear and blood.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.332
And you will beg us
to save you.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.802
We are Cadmus.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.170
Kind of a coincidence that
Cadmus releases a new video

08:57.204 --> 09:00.941
just as criminals get their
hands on alien weapons.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.743
Not a coincidence
if Cadmus is the one

09:02.776 --> 09:04.444
giving them the guns.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.847
FEMALE REPORTER ON TV:
In another case of humans
using alien weaponry,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.617
the National City Children's
Hospital has been damaged.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.051
I don't know
about the rest of you,

09:11.084 --> 09:13.053
but I sure as hell would feel
a lot safer

09:13.086 --> 09:15.188
if I had one of those
super-powered weapons on me

09:15.222 --> 09:16.757
to defend myself.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.926
-That's not the solution.
-Well then, what is?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.761
The bad guys
are running around everywhere

09:20.794 --> 09:22.863
with these high-tech weapons.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.064
I just think it's about time

09:24.097 --> 09:25.799
the good guys got
some of our own.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.768
Alien guns are bad
no matter who controls them.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.069
The Second Amendment
gives us

09:29.102 --> 09:30.337
the right to bear arms.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.072
Even if those arms
are ray guns.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.040
That's what Cadmus wants.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.875
They're the ones
handing out these weapons,

09:34.908 --> 09:36.677
They want us to be
afraid of each other.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.646
to not trust each other
anymore.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.180
Well how do you know
what Cadmus wants?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.683
I... I just do.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.652
JAMES: Okay, guys,
that's enough.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.819
We all know our assignments.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.154
We've got a magazine
to put out.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.588
Let's get it together.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.725
James,
I don't know what to do.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.161
Anndrannian cannons,
Pytharian magma bombs.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.096
These are weapons
that are far more advanced

09:56.129 --> 09:58.866
than anything
we had on Krypton.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.233
Cadmus doesn't care
who gets hurt

10:00.267 --> 10:02.836
in trying to make sure
all aliens get a bad name.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.273
Yeah, well, I'm sure
you and the DEO
will figure something out.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.676
Don't sound so defeatist
or anything.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.077
I'm sorry. I just...

10:10.110 --> 10:11.311
I just don't feel like
there's a lot that I can do

10:11.344 --> 10:12.646
to help behind Cat's desk.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.947
You help.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.283
I couldn't even save
my dad's camera.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.686
Oh, oh... It's okay.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.120
Are you turning into
Miss Grant?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.722
How much work
did you give that girl?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.156
I didn't give her anything.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.126
Eve... Hey, hey,
Eve, let me help you.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.661
Oh, thanks, Kara.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.430
And those were
the yearly quarterly reports
that Mike was supposed to do.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.132
Oh, Mike.
He is so nice.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.434
He was really struggling
with his work
and it's his first day.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.071
So I was just trying
to help him out.
He's so nice.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.640
-You want to get this
or you want me to get it?
-Oh, I want to.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.744
What are you doing?

10:43.777 --> 10:47.147
Eating these red tubes.
They're amazing.
Like pure joy in food form.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.918
No, Mon-El,
there's a time and a place
for eating candy.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.920
Yeah, and it's this time
and this place.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.023
No, this...
This is your place of work.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.292
So when James
gives you a task,

10:59.326 --> 11:02.395
you should be the one
to complete it.
Not Miss Teschmacher.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.964
She wanted to please me.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.733

to please a man...

11:05.766 --> 11:07.968

with that, just don't.

-No, I'm here
to see you, actually.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.953
-You are?
-Yeah.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.288
L-Corp is hosting a party
this weekend.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.924
It's for a gala fundraiser
for the Children's Hospital

11:30.958 --> 11:33.226
after that horrific attack
on their new building.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.963
I was hoping you'd come.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.933
-"Gala"?
Is that like a party?
-No. No, it's not.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.103
You are literally
my only friend
in National City.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.839
Most people
wouldn't touch a Luthor
with a 10-foot pole.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.876
It would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.277
Of course I'll come.
I'm honored.

11:52.112 --> 11:56.316
-I love parties. (CHUCKLES)
Can I come, too?
-No.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.852

your friend can come.

-Mike.

12:01.989 --> 12:05.392

-Well, Mike of the interns,

12:05.425 --> 12:08.195
find yourself a nice suit,
and I'll see you there.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.197

12:15.335 --> 12:17.170
(CHUCKLES) Yes!

12:17.204 --> 12:20.207
Okay,
because the photon cannon is
powered by electromagnetism,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.110
it left a radiation signature
on Supergirl's suit
after the blast,

12:23.143 --> 12:27.014
so we might be able to put
a tracking algorithm...

Maggie is such a terrible
pool player.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.027
I mean,
I even tried to let her win
and she couldn't keep up.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.930
Ma... Maggie,
the NCPD officer?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.898
Yeah. You know she's been
kinda down.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.900
Her... Her girlfriend broke up
with her.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.002
-Ooh. That's too bad.
-Yeah.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.237
I don't know,
lately she just hasn't

12:50.270 --> 12:52.505
really been acting like...
Maggie.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.975
You know?
She's normally so tough,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.444
but now she just seems
so vulnerable.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.146
I just wish I could help her.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
Yeah, I try to stay out of
other people's relationships.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.384
Mm-hmm.
Like you stayed out of
Kara's relationships?

13:04.417 --> 13:07.287
Okay, now, that was different.
I was into Kara.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.923

into this Maggie person.

Whoa. Uh, yup.
I would say so...

13:25.205 --> 13:27.240

there's been another attack.

are too high-profile.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.513

think smaller.

small again.
From now on, it's all big.

My interest is in molding
public perception

14:50.490 --> 14:53.560
through the use
of these weapons.
To sow fear and discontent.

-No, I get it. You're not gay.

you were angling

I don't think so.

on the lookout on the more
probable attack vectors.

No! I can't do it.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.478
-You helped Kara.
-There's a difference, okay.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.548
She can fly.
You're just tall.

23:04.183 --> 23:08.054
You know,
watching my dad's camera
get destroyed...

23:08.087 --> 23:09.556
It reminded me of something.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.560
He gave his life
protecting this country.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.565
And if I do this,
I can honor him.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.667
Or you can end up
just like him.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.640
-Winn.
-What?

23:27.674 --> 23:30.710
I'm gonna continue
to be that crazy guy

23:30.743 --> 23:35.014
with the baseball bat
and the ski mask,
with or without you.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.985
James, guys like us,

23:39.018 --> 23:43.923
we are here
to give people information,

23:43.956 --> 23:46.158
right?
To fight with knowledge.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.695
There is no shame in that,
man.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.431
You gotta think this through.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.469
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.212
A donut? You never eat sugar
in the middle of the day.
What's wrong?

24:06.245 --> 24:08.648
I'm feeling confused
about something.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.818
Your steps were exceptionally
stompy just now.
You all right?

24:11.851 --> 24:13.520
Where do I start?

24:14.521 --> 24:16.556
Mark almost got fired today.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.892
-Who?
-Mark, uh... Mike. Mon-El.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.629
He doesn't take his job
seriously, at all.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.665
It's really like
he's never worked a day
in his life.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.734
Well,
he's from a different planet.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.702
I'm from a different planet,
and I had to deal
with the awkwardness

24:29.736 --> 24:32.004
of seventh grade
when I first got here.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.608
I helped him get
a new identity.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.846
I helped him get
an internship.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.949
I even got him
a new pair of glasses
for a disguise

24:42.982 --> 24:44.250
in case he wants to
put on a cape

24:44.283 --> 24:46.118
and help people
the way I do.

24:46.152 --> 24:50.289
He has everything he needs,
and yet, he's still
a disaster.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.758
Well, that's the problem.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.693
What, the glasses?
I can take those back

24:53.726 --> 24:55.562
but I don't think
it's gonna make
any difference.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.030
Sit.

24:59.732 --> 25:02.234
When you first arrived
at our house,

25:02.268 --> 25:04.270
I thought,
"Finally, I have a sister."

25:04.303 --> 25:06.839
-An alien sister.
-Even better.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.809
But I still wanted you
to be just like me.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.678
To do everything
that I did.

25:11.711 --> 25:15.047
-So I dragged you out
to science fairs.
-Those were so boring.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.749
Made you watch scary movies.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.285
What do you have
against a good old
romantic comedy?

25:19.318 --> 25:21.688
Forced you to listen
to the music
that I liked.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.890
Yeah, your punk-rock phase
was very strange.

25:23.923 --> 25:27.159
But finally, I let it go.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.295
Let you do your own thing,
find your own hobbies,

25:29.328 --> 25:31.898
listen to your own
weird music.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.634
Uh, NSync, first of all,
is not weird.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.069
And second of all,
they are amazing.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.840
Mon-El is not you.
Just like you're not me.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.310
So what works for you
might not work for him.

25:44.343 --> 25:49.782
You know, people
just have to figure out
what works for them.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.718
Know who they are inside.

25:52.819 --> 25:53.820
What they're meant to be.

25:55.988 --> 26:00.627
So you're saying, the job,
the sweater and the glasses
are a bit too much?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.129
Not everyone can rock argyle
like you do.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.131
Huh. (SIGHS)

26:05.164 --> 26:08.868
Oh, God. You came here
wanting to talk to me
about something

26:08.901 --> 26:12.071
and I haven't shut my mouth.
I'm sorry. What is it?
What's wrong?

-I...
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

26:21.113 --> 26:23.582

-Who?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.689
Lena, hi.
Come on in.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.725
I'm sorry to keep dropping in
on you. It's...

26:33.726 --> 26:35.194
Hey, I know you.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.896
You saved my life.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.366
-Special Agent
Alex Danvers, FBI.
-She's my sister.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.769
This city's smaller
than I thought.

26:42.802 --> 26:43.870
Hmm.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.105
Well, actually, maybe you can
both help me. Um...

26:46.138 --> 26:48.708
You remember,
I told you about that stupid
fight club last week?

26:48.741 --> 26:50.910
Now it's my turn
to ask for a favor.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.311
Anything. Shoot.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.246
I need to get in touch
with Supergirl.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.121
WOMAN: I'm not used
to being summoned.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.323
MINER: I held up my end
of the bargain.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.793
People are afraid
of these weapons.

27:06.826 --> 27:10.730
-You got what you wanted.
-And what is it
you now want, Mr. Miner?

27:10.763 --> 27:12.431
One last score.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.101
You wanna take on
Lena Luthor?

27:15.134 --> 27:16.402
She's holding an event.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.671
National City's wealthiest
will all be there,

27:18.705 --> 27:22.742
decked out in their
finest diamonds and gold.
It'll be the mother lode.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.845
Plus you'll get
that public dazzle
you're looking for.

27:25.878 --> 27:29.315
The Luthors are smart
and dangerous.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.317
You don't wanna go up
against them.

27:31.350 --> 27:36.422
I took down Supergirl.
I'm not afraid of some
spoiled, rich brat.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.290
It's a mistake
to underestimate her.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.694
You wanna attack
that fundraiser,
you do it with what you have.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.766
Your cause is pure greed,
Mr. Miner.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.769
Which is fine.
I don't hold it against you.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.271
But my cause
is something far nobler.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.341
I'm fighting for my children.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.177
My son, my daughter.

27:58.210 --> 28:02.348
Their lives depend
on the successful attainment
of my goal.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.417
To end alien influence
over our planet.

28:07.086 --> 28:10.923
I'm trying
to save the world
from an alien apocalypse.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.225
Do you really think
I'm afraid of you?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.966
Take on Lena Luthor,
and you do it at your peril.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.469
We're taking down that party.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.714
Supergirl.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.483
You wanted to see me?

28:37.516 --> 28:41.087
Yeah, thank you for coming.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.089
I wanted to invited you
to my party.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.992
Kara Danvers told me
you were going on
with the fundraiser.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.060
You can't.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.329
It's definitely
going to be a target
for this gang.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.231
Well, that's why
I need you there
to protect it.

28:52.264 --> 28:56.068
With Supergirl in attendance,
I know my guests
and I will be safe.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.404
You like to take risks,
don't you?

28:58.437 --> 29:01.507
When Corben was after you
and now this. Why?

29:01.540 --> 29:03.442
Well, you can't live in fear.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.114
You, more than anyone,
must understand that.

29:08.147 --> 29:11.217
Time and again,
you risk everything
to see justice done.

29:11.250 --> 29:15.121
Is it so hard to believe
that I feel the same way?

29:15.154 --> 29:19.225
Are you one of those people
that thinks there's no such
thing as a good Luthor?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.928
I believe everyone
should be judged
on their own merits.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.129
Then judge me on mine.

29:23.162 --> 29:27.399
This party must happen,
and I am asking you
for your help.

29:27.433 --> 29:31.170
-I guess I have no choice.
-Thank you.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.373
-So Kara and I will see you
tomorrow night?
-Right.

29:34.406 --> 29:38.044
Yes, Kara and I
will both be
at your party.

to see you.
I'm glad you could come.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.442
Um, have you seen Supergirl?

30:10.476 --> 30:13.145
I'm sure she's on her way.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.581
Oh, I am so...
Did I spill this on you?

30:15.614 --> 30:17.884
Does anybody have
some seltzer?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.453
Supergirl,
I'm glad you could make it.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.222

this might be a bad idea.

Well, why don't we
wait and see
how the evening pans out.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.059
I'll check the perimeter
for any activity,

that would be suicide.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.882
I spent so many years
sitting at that little desk
out there,

35:50.916 --> 35:53.785
just creating firewalls,
you know, and just...

35:53.819 --> 35:56.722
Keep people from finding out
the newest
celebrity baby names

35:56.755 --> 35:58.924
or how much money
Cat spent at Barney's,

35:58.957 --> 36:02.928
which is a lot more
than you think.
Like... (SCOFFS)

36:02.961 --> 36:06.598
I wasn't really
doing important work.
Not really.

36:06.632 --> 36:09.868
And you're right,
now, I'm working at the DEO,

36:09.901 --> 36:14.573
I am, and it's amazing.
I get it.

36:16.308 --> 36:20.812
Being a hero, it's...
It's addictive.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.215
(BOTH LAUGH)

36:23.249 --> 36:26.752
Plus, you know,
I would feel bad if you went
and got yourself killed

36:26.785 --> 36:28.520
when I could've helped you.
Blah blah...

36:32.591 --> 36:34.560
-I've been thinking about
my suit.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.962
Oh, please. I already have
something in the works.
Just trust me, okay?

36:36.995 --> 36:41.433
Do me a favor,
do not run into the line
of fire until it is ready.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.435
-Deal?
-Deal.

36:43.469 --> 36:47.373
And, have you thought
of a superhero name?
Every superhero needs a name.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.309
-I got one.
-Are you gonna tell me?

36:52.744 --> 36:57.215
When we're ready...
Everybody's gonna know it.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.590
-KARA: Good morning.
-(GRUNTS)

37:06.492 --> 37:07.659
Am I late for work?

37:07.693 --> 37:09.761
KARA: Oh, no.
You were fired.

37:12.364 --> 37:16.602
Yeah, I'm not sure
it was my destiny
to be an intern.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.804
Yeah, I'm not so sure either.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.973
-So, you're not mad at me?
-I get the feeling I'm always
gonna be a little mad at you.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.010
Yeah, I get that feeling too.

37:27.379 --> 37:32.751
When I was younger,
I had no idea what I wanted
to be here on Earth.

37:32.784 --> 37:37.723
I had a family to help me
and guide me, but...

37:37.756 --> 37:40.392
Ultimately I had to make
my own choices.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.028
And I was trying to impose
those choices on you

37:43.061 --> 37:45.697
because when you landed
I was just so excited

37:45.731 --> 37:49.535
to have someone
to take under my wing...
To look after.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.937
I never got to do that
with my cousin.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.343
But you are your own man.

37:57.376 --> 38:02.514
And your life here on Earth
is going to be very different
from mine,

38:02.548 --> 38:05.351
and that's fine.
That's great.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.054
So, does this mean
I don't need to get a job?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.889
-You still need to get a job.
-Right.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.892
But just pick something
that you like.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.795
And I'll be here to help you,
however you need me to.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.864
That's what
a real mentor does.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.934
I got you something.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.672
-It's a guide
to National City.
-Hmm.

38:26.705 --> 38:30.108
-Thank you, Kara.
-Mm-hmm.

38:30.141 --> 38:34.045
-What's a "strip club"?
-You know, let's just take
that page out.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.524
I heard what happened.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.626
You okay?

38:47.659 --> 38:50.128
I've seen some crazy stuff
since I joined
the Science Force,

38:50.161 --> 38:51.897
but that was...

38:53.164 --> 38:54.633
That was...

38:56.402 --> 38:58.770
What are you doing here?

38:58.804 --> 39:03.375
-I was worried about you.
-Look, I'm sorry if I was
too forward the other day.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.710
That wasn't my place.

39:13.419 --> 39:17.856
My whole life has been about
being perfect.

39:17.889 --> 39:24.463
Perfect grades, perfect job
and the perfect sister
taking care of Kara.

39:24.496 --> 39:28.634
But the one part of my life
that I've never been able
to make perfect

39:30.168 --> 39:32.003
was dating.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.773
I just never really liked it.
I... I...

39:34.806 --> 39:39.110
And, you know, I mean,
I tried. I got asked out.
I just...

39:40.446 --> 39:41.780
I never liked...

39:44.049 --> 39:45.383
Being intimate.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.421
I just...

39:49.455 --> 39:52.624
I don't know.
I thought maybe that's
just not the way I was built.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.160
You know,
it's just not my thing.

39:55.193 --> 39:58.630
I never thought
that it was because of...

39:58.664 --> 39:59.765
The other.

39:59.798 --> 40:03.401
That... (LAUGHS)
Maybe I...

40:05.604 --> 40:07.606
I mean... I don't...

40:07.639 --> 40:12.578
I don't know. Now, I just...
I can't stop thinking about...

40:12.611 --> 40:13.779
About what?

40:21.119 --> 40:24.122
That maybe...

40:24.155 --> 40:28.093
There's some truth
to what you said.

40:29.695 --> 40:30.862
About?

40:32.197 --> 40:33.699
What you said.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.867
About me.

40:37.235 --> 40:38.436
Hmm.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.141
I have to go.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.446
I'm glad you're okay.

40:53.251 --> 40:56.221
You took a great risk,
Miss Luthor.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.924
Why didn't you tell me
what you were up to?

40:58.957 --> 41:03.529
I doubt you would've believed
that a Luthor just wanted
to see justice done.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.931
Well, I couldn't have
stopped them without you.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.833
Thank you.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.603
Who would've believed it.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.640
-A Luthor
and a Super working together?
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

41:14.673 --> 41:17.943
-I hope we can work together
more in the future.
-Me too.

41:17.976 --> 41:23.148
Oh! I didn't realize
you had company.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.084
Would you excuse me,
Supergirl?
I have to take this.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.118
Of course.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.022
Sorry I missed your party.

41:32.658 --> 41:33.825
What else is new?

41:35.861 --> 41:37.162
What can I do for you,

41:38.229 --> 41:39.164
Mom?
