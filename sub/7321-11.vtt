00:03.103 --> 00:06.072
<i>We all get at least</i>
<i>one good wish a year...</i>

00:06.106 --> 00:08.506
<i>...over the candles on our birthday.</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:11.802
<i>Some of us throw in more.</i>

00:12.045 --> 00:14.013
<i>On eyelashes...</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:18.079
<i>...fountains...</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.816
<i>...lucky stars.</i>

00:22.389 --> 00:24.482
<i>And every now and then...</i>

00:25.792 --> 00:27.726
<i>...one of those wishes comes true.</i>

00:32.932 --> 00:35.958
I don't wanna go to work.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.334
It's warm in here. It's a cocoon.

00:39.305 --> 00:43.366
- No Cristina with the mean face.
- No lives to save.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.909
A quickie?

00:45.945 --> 00:48.345
A quickie will make me feel better.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.442
You definitely need a quickie.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.044
<i>So what then?</i>

00:55.088 --> 00:57.283
<i>Is it as good as we hoped?</i>

00:57.323 --> 01:00.292
<i>Do we bask in the warm glow</i>
<i>of our happiness?</i>

01:00.860 --> 01:02.725
<i>Or</i>...

01:04.129 --> 01:07.065
<i>...do we just notice we've got</i>
<i>a long list of other wishes</i>

01:07.100 --> 01:09.125
<i>waiting to be wished?</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:17.032
- Happy birthday.
- What? Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.705
OK, we gotta move fast,
people, so focus.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.613
O'Malley, the pit. Karev, you're
with me. We got a surgery.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.116
Stevens, clinic budget is due.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.084
Yang, Grey, wait for the Chief
at the trauma bay.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.882
- What? Why?
- Both of us?

01:27.921 --> 01:31.914
Yes, both of you. I don't know what,
I don't know why. Just go.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.553
They're all silent rage-y.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.656
- What do you got?
- Take a look.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.360
So, what do we have?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.168
- Caldwell, as in the prison?
- Yeah.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.907
- You read up on our VIP?
- Yes.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.935
Multiple stab wounds, badly beaten.
He'll have guards with him at all times.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.776
Cuffs stay on, leg irons stay on.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.011
Watch your syringes, sharps and pens.
I don't want any accidents.

02:00.987 --> 02:03.751
And he's here.
You four are my team. No interns.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.417
Keep this as quiet as possible.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.393
Get him in and out quickly.
Patch him up, get him on his way.

02:08.428 --> 02:09.554
What's PDR?

02:09.596 --> 02:11.393
Get him out of trauma
as fast as you can.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.160
Those guards attract attention.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.662
Sir, it's stamped PDR. What is PDR?

02:16.703 --> 02:17.931
Prisoner...

02:19.506 --> 02:20.837
Death Row.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.815
How's everybody
doing this morning?

02:42.228 --> 02:45.823
- Mr. Dunn, can you hear me?
- You have a lovely voice.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.696
We need a trauma series.

02:50.036 --> 02:54.405
I hate to be a bother,
but my legs really, really hurt.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.341
- Was I stabbed in the leg?
- We didn't find anything.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.709
- Add T-spine, L-spine films.
- We're getting a CT,

02:59.746 --> 03:02.374
- extra films are a waste.
- More shots can't hurt.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.145
If I wasn't stabbed,
why does it feel like I was?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.880
The less you talk
the more we can work.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.547
- Derek.
- That's OK.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.579
He'll warm up
as we get to know each other.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.990
- I don't think so.
- You'll see. We're not that different.

03:14.027 --> 03:19.590
People are alive when they meet us,
and then it all changes somehow.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.035
Hi there.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.242
What are you doing?

03:33.279 --> 03:34.576
I'm saying hello.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.047
Listen.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.210
My best friend
made one simple request,

03:39.252 --> 03:41.880
that I not get anywhere near you,
and I slipped.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.788
It was fantastic. You're fantastic.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.758
But it's not gonna happen again, ever.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.395
OK.

03:58.638 --> 03:59.866
Damn it!

04:00.540 --> 04:02.872
Yep. I think you broke your hip.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.343
Are you kidding me?!

04:05.979 --> 04:08.072
Come on!

04:08.114 --> 04:10.173
- Who are you talking to?
- Last month,

04:10.250 --> 04:14.414
I tripped and I cracked a rib. In April,
I fell in the shower and I broke my arm.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.753
January, broke two fingers
doing yoga. Yoga!

04:17.790 --> 04:20.656
This is my sixth break in a year.
So I stare at the heavens

04:20.692 --> 04:23.992
and without belief in a higher power
but a need to blame someone,

04:24.030 --> 04:26.089
I yell "Come freaking on!"

04:26.132 --> 04:29.465
how about we call ortho,
have them run tests.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.130
More satisfying than
shouting at the heavens.

04:32.839 --> 04:33.863
Thank you.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.503
Ow.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.674
Jackson Prescott, you shot up again!

04:43.716 --> 04:46.048
- No, I didn't.
- Then why do you look so big?

04:46.085 --> 04:49.145
- You're short.
- I've always been short, you grew.

04:49.188 --> 04:53.022
While I check Jackson, why don't you
take Melinda through today's procedure.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.651
Yeah, no problem. Come on.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.963
Did you see he looks more yellow?

04:57.997 --> 05:01.524
OK, Dr. Kenley's going to check
his liver function test.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.330
Before we start, let me explain.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.929
Jackson's had 12 bowel resections.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.440
Dr. Kenley calls me
any time Jackson's here.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.601
Now, Melinda is a single mom.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.340
She works like a maniac to make sure
that beautiful boy has coverage.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.439
- Miranda...
- Don't even start.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.043
This is a special family.
We do whatever we can to help.

05:20.086 --> 05:24.648
- It's really not necessary...
- It is necessary.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.018
We'll take good care of your kid.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.790
Thank you.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.461
Now let's talk about the surgery.

05:36.602 --> 05:39.162
Are you gonna let me have
a lollipop this time?

05:39.205 --> 05:41.639
- My stomach's not bad right now.
- It's not?

05:41.674 --> 05:43.938
So how come I'm about
to cut a piece out of it?

05:43.976 --> 05:46.638
Give me one of the lollipops,
and if I keep it down

05:46.679 --> 05:48.442
we don't have to do the operation.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.642
I'm not sure that's gonna...

05:50.683 --> 05:52.548
I'm not...

05:52.819 --> 05:54.377
- I'm...
- Dr. Kenley?

05:55.888 --> 05:59.324
Jackson, hit the blue button.
Behind you. The blue button!

06:00.626 --> 06:02.491
- <i>Code blue, second floor.</i>
- What...?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.359
<i>Code blue, second floor.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:06.730
Oh, my God!

06:06.766 --> 06:08.757
- What happened?
- He just fell over.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.104
Sir...

06:18.945 --> 06:20.708
...I have some bad news.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.944
It looks like Jordan Kenley
just had a massive coronary.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.746
He was gone before he hit the deck.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.345
His wife's on the way.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.620
She'll probably want to speak to you,
the wife. Hear something reassuring.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.821
He'll be missed. Honored colleague.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.057
Decades of service.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.530
Sir, you in there?

06:48.174 --> 06:49.732
Sir?

06:52.078 --> 06:55.013
I have to tell Alex. About us.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.775
"Us" us? No. That's a bad idea.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.948
- That is monumentally bad.
- It's not fair. You know about him.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.753
Yeah. I don't like it.
And if I could off him I would,

07:05.792 --> 07:09.057
but he's the moody, broody one,
whereas I am mature and...

07:09.095 --> 07:10.119
Dead.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.721
You're dead.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.726
I'm alive, and he's alive,

07:14.767 --> 07:18.134
I'm happy when I'm with him.
Don't you want me to be happy?

07:18.771 --> 07:21.899
Yes, there isn't anything
in this universe that I want more.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.603
Why can't I have you both?
That's what makes me happy.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.746
He's gonna think you're a whackjob.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.813
He told me that he loves me.

07:34.854 --> 07:39.120
That's a huge deal for him.
The least I can do is be honest.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.928
Sorry about your doc.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.194
Whatever.

07:50.069 --> 07:53.971
Dr. Kenley was gonna sign this,
before he died and everything.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.497
- Can you?
- What is it?

07:56.542 --> 07:59.067
I want to get a wish
from the wish people.

07:59.111 --> 08:03.207
- You have to have a doctor sign it.
- No. I'm not signing that.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.350
Don't look at her,
she's not gonna sign it either.

08:07.386 --> 08:11.083
Come on. Look, if you sign,
you can help me pick my wish.

08:11.123 --> 08:15.389
These are the ones kids have already
done, like go on a circus trapeze,

08:15.428 --> 08:18.886
or be in the rodeo. Put stars
by the ones you think would be cool,

08:18.931 --> 08:22.526
- X's by the ones you think are lame.
- No way Kenley was gonna sign that.

08:22.568 --> 08:26.664
It's for kids with life-threatening
diseases. You're not dying, just sick.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.667
Dude...

08:29.709 --> 08:32.940
The rodeo smells like horse crap.
You're not missing anything.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.448
I think we've got a parathyroid tumor
for you to remove.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.386
- Really.
- Did I just hear tumor removal?

08:43.422 --> 08:46.084
My resident abandoned me.
Do you need any help?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.353
- Sure.
- No!

08:47.393 --> 08:50.385
Or... Fine, but you'll watch.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.921
You're not touching anything.
Get it? No touching.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.830
Uh, she's up in ultrasound.
Call and see if they took her yet.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.867
- You slept with her?
- Absolutely not!

09:07.380 --> 09:09.211
Only once.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.945
She came to my hotel room, took off
all her clothes and said teach me.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.011
I had no control.
She violated me with her nakedness.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.682
Derek's gonna kill me.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.022
- Shouldn't have been alone with her.
- Never gonna happen again,

09:21.060 --> 09:25.053
- mind-blowingly fantastic as it was.
- Hey, you are a professional.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.463
Hi! Oh, hold on.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.200
Hold tight.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.697
Just a bit of lint.
Ultrasound's backed up,

09:33.739 --> 09:36.299
but they'll have results
in half an hour.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.539
All right. Well, tell Grey.

09:40.646 --> 09:44.548
And let George...
Dr. George...

09:44.584 --> 09:48.179
Dr. O'Malley know when...
Let him know when you know, OK?

09:50.456 --> 09:53.619
You were saying something
about professionalism.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.560
Did you see that?
That was not in my head, right?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.826
These interns are out of control.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.890
- Stalkers.
- Sexed-up stalkers.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.903
Dr. Bailey? Arizona Robbins.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.430
- I'm taking over Dr. Kenley's patients.
- You're the peds surgeon?

10:09.475 --> 10:11.500
You're assisting with
Jackson Prescott.

10:11.544 --> 10:15.412
All due respect to Dr. Kenley,
he was a wonderful physician.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.678
I'm surprised he followed
this treatment

10:17.717 --> 10:20.447
when it wasn't, you know, working.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.148
I'm not criticizing you.
You didn't make the call.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.626
But I supported the call.
We hadn't turned the corner yet,

10:27.660 --> 10:31.096
but Kenley was sure that if
we kept doing what we were doing...

10:31.130 --> 10:33.496
- Jack's case is quite severe...
- Jackson.

10:33.532 --> 10:36.092
- Excuse me?
- Jackson is his name.

10:36.135 --> 10:40.265
And if you're suggesting we were
torturing him with useless procedures...

10:40.306 --> 10:44.037
A lot of senior peds surgeons
believe that strictureplasty works,

10:44.076 --> 10:46.943
and sometimes they're right.
So we'll go with it today,

10:46.979 --> 10:50.312
but we should start exploring
other options.

10:50.349 --> 10:54.649
I gotta run. Dr. Kenley had a big
case load. See you in the OR.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.551
He's still in a lot of pain,
I'm not sure why.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.495
It'll help if we get him
off this backboard.

11:04.530 --> 11:08.159
Shouldn't we wait for X-rays? Decreased
sensation in his lower extremity.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.600
According to him.
He could tell you anything.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.161
We pushed morphine.
He shouldn't be in this much pain.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.537
Maybe we could push a teeny bit more?

11:15.574 --> 11:17.235
Not here to feed your drug habit.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.437
I've been behind bars for 11 years.

11:19.478 --> 11:22.709
The drug trade in solitary
isn't what one would hope.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.649
- Let's just wait for the films.
- This is a waste of time.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.984
I hate to agree with Yang,
but I agree with Yang.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.319
Dr. Grey?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.061
Dr. Shepherd?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.094
What's that?

11:42.134 --> 11:44.227
Whatever they stabbed him with
is in there.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.295
- In his back?
- Spine.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.239
Does that mean I'm paralyzed?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.574
My execution date is in a week.

11:55.614 --> 11:59.311
I've exhausted all my appeals.
But if I'm paralyzed,

11:59.351 --> 12:03.287
my lawyer might be able to make
a case for staying my execution.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.620
Do you think you could
let me be a gimp?

12:06.859 --> 12:08.258
No.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.628
Is the Chief in there?
I need to see him.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.640
So do I.
We're going to be disappointed.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.768
What exactly is he doing in there?

12:24.810 --> 12:26.937
Ever since he heard about Jordan Kenley,

12:26.979 --> 12:29.607
he's been in there
and he wants to be alone.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.147
I need to see...!

12:35.354 --> 12:39.586
It's impinging on the spinal cord.
Can't tell if it's going through or not.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.321
We'll get a better picture
once we get the CTs back.

12:42.361 --> 12:45.728
I ordered an MRl. The CT may not
give us a clear view of the cord.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.756
We'll look at all the images.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.927
Everything by the book. I don't
want some lawyer keeping him alive

12:50.970 --> 12:53.461
on the basis we did not
give him the standard of care.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.667
- You're pro-death penalty?
- Pro-punishment.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.108
Good people do bad things.
People screw up.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.739
He's still a person. We don't know
what crime he committed.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.806
Maybe he killed a cop.
Feel all warm for the cop killer.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.818
We don't know what he did.
We can't judge.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.844
No, but a jury can. Death row.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.449
We're wasting time debating this.
Do a repeat crit,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.356
let me know if he needs blood.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.497
- I thought they were friends.
- They were.

13:20.533 --> 13:24.799
- And now?
- You and I are in for a very long day.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.805
The annoying twins got a mass murderer.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.138
Think one will pay the guy
to off the other?

13:30.176 --> 13:33.043
No. If they're gonna get violent,
they'll do it themselves.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.979
- It's weird, right? Them fighting?
- Um...

13:37.049 --> 13:41.850
There's something that I need to talk
to you about, it's gonna sound weird.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.321
And I want you to know
I know it sounds weird,

13:44.356 --> 13:47.223
- so just don't freak out.
- Are you breaking up with me?

13:47.259 --> 13:49.955
- No, not at all.
- Though that's not a bad idea.

13:49.995 --> 13:54.125
I see Denny. A lot, lately.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.000
Around here, and at the house.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.029
Are you OK? 'Cause that sounds
kind of whacked.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.301
What did I tell you?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.901
You never saw your grandmother
after she died?

14:04.944 --> 14:09.404
Yeah, she showed up in a dream
and told me not to play with the parts.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.376
Well, it's kind of like that.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.387
- Excuse me?
- All right. Whatever.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.979
That's it?

14:17.022 --> 14:20.480
I don't know. Tell him I said hi.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.454
Kind of like his grandmother
telling him not to...

14:25.497 --> 14:27.397
OK, so I panicked!

14:28.567 --> 14:31.229
Mr. Dunn, are you feeling any better?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.534
Everybody's been so attentive.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.268
I'm still in a lot of pain.

14:36.308 --> 14:39.641
We're gonna get that thing out
of your back as soon as we can.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.441
You're on the cord.

14:43.782 --> 14:47.445
She's kind of a bitch.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.887
Not to use coarse language,
but she is.

14:51.257 --> 14:55.057
- Well, she's my friend.
- Really?

14:55.094 --> 14:57.187
We had a fight.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.299
Mr. Dunn, it will really help us
when we take it out

15:01.333 --> 15:03.460
if we know what that thing
in your back is.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.697
I'm pretty sure it was a toothbrush.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.366
Somebody snapped the head off
and melted it down

15:08.407 --> 15:11.570
till it was less toothbrush
and more knife.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.473
How did it end up in your spine?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.482
Got in a fight with a friend.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.918
Hey, lady!

15:27.826 --> 15:30.920
- Can you help me?
- Sure.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.555
- You feeling OK?
- Yeah.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.396
You see, I'm gonna get a wish
from the wish people,

15:35.434 --> 15:38.426
but I'm having trouble
deciding which wish to pick.

15:38.470 --> 15:42.099
I'm getting people's opinions.
Put stars by the ones you like

15:42.141 --> 15:46.237
and X's by the ones you think are lame.
Then you have to sign something.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.839
OK. How about a trip to China?
That sounds cool.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.009
- I get airsick.
- Hmm.

15:52.051 --> 15:55.179
- How about the rodeo?
- Some guy said it smells like poo.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.085
What the hell are you doing?

15:57.122 --> 15:59.420
Stars and X's.
We're picking wishes.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.256
He's not even eligible.
You're a little scammer.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.888
- You're fake dying?
- I want to go to the rodeo!

16:04.930 --> 16:07.421
You just told me it smells like poo!

16:07.466 --> 16:09.434
Nice try.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.164
Come on, let's get you prepped
for surgery.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.937
You told him. He knows.
Stop worrying.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.348
You've got a tumor
on a little gland in your neck.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.913
Come on!

16:31.090 --> 16:34.582
She does that.
Margaret, the tumor is benign

16:34.626 --> 16:37.026
and it's not hard to remove.
Dr. Harris?

16:37.062 --> 16:40.793
A parathyroid tumor tells your body
to leech calcium out of your bones.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.528
That's why you've had fractures.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.695
Once the tumor's out,
you'll be back to normal.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.901
Come on!

16:50.943 --> 16:53.741
- This is good news.
- I've been living like an old lady.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.408
I don't take the stairs,
I gave up running, skiing.

16:57.449 --> 17:00.612
I sit and knit and hope
the knitting doesn't break a finger.

17:00.652 --> 17:04.679
- All because of a tumor?
- Tumor that's benign, easy to remove.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.722
Come on!

17:09.094 --> 17:10.425
There was a guy.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.028
I fell in love
with the most amazing guy.

17:16.068 --> 17:19.162
He was sweet, kind,
best sex of my life

17:19.204 --> 17:20.762
and he had to move to Denver.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.740
And he wanted me to move with him.

17:22.775 --> 17:27.769
And I didn't because Denver is icy.
Too many ways for me to slip and fall.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.806
So I lose my guy and I break all these
bones from a bone-sucking tumor?!

17:31.850 --> 17:33.909
Are you kidding me?!

17:33.952 --> 17:36.284
Sorry. From the lab, Dr. Sloan.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.188
Did you need something else?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.729
- This is torture.
- Focus.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.935
OK. Karev, can you pull
the retractor more?

17:50.969 --> 17:53.267
- Like that?
- Yeah. Great.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.903
Damn. Look at this. It's a mess.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.242
He'll have maybe 10 centimeters
of bowel when we're done.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.340
Can't we try a Bianchi procedure,
see if we can save more of it?

18:04.383 --> 18:07.546
Bowel's dead and the liver's
cirrhotic. No saving anything.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.746
- But...
- Dr. Bailey.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.812
He should have been
on a transplant list a year ago.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.756
It's a miracle he's still alive.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.499
What are...

18:27.005 --> 18:28.199
What are you doing?

18:28.240 --> 18:32.836
- I'm not seeing anyone today, Bailey.
- I know that, but this is important.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.312
Every conversation I have
is important.

18:35.347 --> 18:39.511
Kenley has been replaced with an infant
on roller skates named Arizona,

18:39.551 --> 18:42.418
who didn't have sense enough
to change her name,

18:42.454 --> 18:45.582
which shows poor judgment,
as does her diagnosis of a patient

18:45.624 --> 18:47.990
that I've been working with
for three years.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.927
She's changing
Kenley's treatment protocol

18:50.963 --> 18:53.932
based on half an hour
of experience with the child.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.457
We just took out most of his bowel,

18:56.502 --> 18:59.062
and instead of trying to salvage
what he has left,

18:59.104 --> 19:02.369
she wants to throw up her hands
and pray for a transplant.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.967
The child hasn't eaten solid food
in months.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.843
He hasn't grown in years.
His liver is shot.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.814
It is a serious case!

19:09.848 --> 19:12.316
Now we need someone
who can handle it.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.419
Dr. Bailey...

19:16.188 --> 19:19.351
...you thought Shepherd
was just a haircut.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.382
You didn't like Hahn,

19:21.426 --> 19:25.453
and you think Dr. Sloan is a hussy.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.499
Can you name any attending
that you thought was good?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.865
I've always been a fan of your work.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.369
Arizona Robbins
was top of her class, like you.

19:40.412 --> 19:43.074
And she was chief resident, like you.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.642
And she's the best anyone's seen
in a long time, just like you.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.917
She is who we have, we don't have
anyone else. Deal with it.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.066
What's that for?

20:09.107 --> 20:12.338
You're short of a friend today.
So I thought I'd fill in.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.175
Colleagues aren't friends,
they're competitors.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.183
Oh. So does that mean
you're not gonna drink this coffee?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.708
No. I'll drink the coffee.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.880
MRl. He's got brain contusions
on top of everything else.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.357
Mr. Dunn is still
in a huge amount of pain.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.389
Can I give him more morphine
or will that cause problems?

20:35.467 --> 20:40.234
- Mr. Dunn has had enough morphine.
- He's got a foreign body in his spine.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.763
- It's inhumane.
- Killing people is inhumane.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.436
Denying them painkillers
is a judgment call.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.615
Derek, what's wrong with you?

20:51.783 --> 20:54.081
I watch people die all the time.

20:54.152 --> 20:58.384
I go to families and tell them their
world's been ripped apart all the time.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.358
I fight to make sure
I don't have to deliver that message

21:01.393 --> 21:03.623
and I lose that fight all the time.

21:04.630 --> 21:08.794
Then some guy like Dunn comes along
and simply throws it away. Life.

21:09.868 --> 21:14.430
Then he's got the nerve to tell me
he and I are two sides of the same coin?

21:14.473 --> 21:16.270
You're not.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.936
He doesn't need morphine.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.607
But she's exquisite.

21:22.648 --> 21:27.415
And it's not just the sex.
We talked for hours, and laughed.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.646
It's just the sex.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.588
You're gonna tell me
you're not thinking about Sadie?

21:33.558 --> 21:34.957
Nope. No.

21:34.993 --> 21:39.123
I cannot have another stupid
romantic disaster in this hospital.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.327
- It's embarrassing.
- You do have quite a track record.

21:42.367 --> 21:46.394
You know what? We need to find
something else to think about.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.129
Worth a try.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.707
Nope, not working.

21:56.748 --> 21:57.908
Nope.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.974
OK. Ooh, OK!

22:00.018 --> 22:03.784
We're like addicts, right?
We need a 12-step program.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.222
I'm not going to a meeting
to discuss my obsession

22:06.258 --> 22:08.385
with my friend's
girlfriend's half sister.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.021
It'll just be us.
We'll be each other's sponsors.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.692
- Make sure we stay on the program.
- What are the steps?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.529
Don't get naked with an intern.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.432
It's more of a one-step program.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.671
- Maybe I should write this down.
- Yeah.

22:27.713 --> 22:32.514
Hey, Cristina, can you mention
that it's Izzie's birthday today?

22:32.551 --> 22:34.610
Someone should do something about it.

22:34.653 --> 22:38.521
I myself am planning a party
with balloons, streamers,

22:38.557 --> 22:40.923
- and a bouncy house.
- You know what?

22:40.959 --> 22:44.486
- Alex should do something.
- I know. I got it under control.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.656
Bouncy house?

22:50.836 --> 22:52.804
Is he here?

22:52.838 --> 22:54.169
Who?

22:55.006 --> 22:56.769
Your friend.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.833
No. He's not here.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.108
If he shows up, tell him I'll share
my girl, but not my sandwich.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.172
This thing cost four bucks.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.954
Oh, I'm done here.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.859
Dude from MRl was all freaked out
about death row guy.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.957
Couldn't put his cuffs in the machine,
They had to Velcro him.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.969
Tech thought he was gonna
tear it off and storm the booth

23:25.003 --> 23:27.631
- like the Hulk or something.
- What did he do?

23:27.672 --> 23:29.469
He laid there and had that MRl.

23:29.508 --> 23:33.740
No. What did he do
to get on death row,

23:33.779 --> 23:35.770
mow down people with a machine gun?

23:35.814 --> 23:38.305
Probably found his wife
with a hooker and a handyman.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.284
They don't give the death penalty
for crimes of passion.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.786
- People understand that.
- All crimes are crimes of passion.

23:42.821 --> 23:46.917
People don't do stuff like that
because they forget it's illegal.

23:51.797 --> 23:55.528
When you kill her, is it gonna be
a crime of passion?

23:56.802 --> 23:59.498
- That still hasn't blown over?
- It's not a big deal.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.301
We had a fight.
She took it too far.

24:01.339 --> 24:04.206
- You want to know what I think?
- Not really.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.179
Hey.

24:09.214 --> 24:12.479
I need to scream or kill someone.
I'm leaning towards killing.

24:12.517 --> 24:13.882
Working.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.782
I'm feeling much better, thanks.

24:20.826 --> 24:24.489
Thank you for whatever it was
you gave me.

24:26.431 --> 24:30.026
Is there family or someone who
should know you're having surgery?

24:30.068 --> 24:34.368
We can't call your family.
I think what she's trying to ask is,

24:34.406 --> 24:37.671
- what did you do to get death row?
- You don't have to answer that.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.939
- That was not what I was asking.
- I don't mind.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.776
It's an obvious question.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.013
One Monday,
I slit this woman's throat.

24:50.388 --> 24:55.189
I'd been thinking about it
for a while, dreaming about it.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.128
And one Monday, I just...

24:59.097 --> 25:01.122
I had to do it.

25:01.166 --> 25:06.502
I just... really wanted
to draw a knife across her neck.

25:07.539 --> 25:11.532
And I thought it would be terrifying

25:11.576 --> 25:14.909
or sad or something,

25:14.946 --> 25:17.608
but it wasn't, it was just...

25:19.518 --> 25:21.418
...kind of fun.

25:24.055 --> 25:28.287
So I did two more on Tuesday
and another two on Wednesday.

25:28.326 --> 25:31.784
I was gonna go for three on Thursday,
I liked the alliteration,

25:31.830 --> 25:34.162
but I got caught so I didn't.

25:38.336 --> 25:39.928
Can I get some Jell-O?

25:39.971 --> 25:44.203
Or is that bad, before surgery?

25:54.619 --> 25:57.554
- Read the sign!
- I was told to ignore the sign.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.819
- Well, don't!
- Bailey told me.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.390
I'm gonna kill that woman.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.995
Look, I didn't know Kenley
all that well,

26:12.037 --> 26:14.062
but it's gotta be tough.

26:14.105 --> 26:16.403
Losing a co-worker you've
worked with for a long time.

26:16.441 --> 26:17.965
Jordan Kenley was a son of a bitch.

26:18.543 --> 26:22.377
Great with kids, good with a scalpel.
Horrible to his colleagues.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.214
Competitive, insecure, aggressive.
I won't miss him for a minute.

26:26.785 --> 26:30.152
So... is this about your mortality?

26:37.262 --> 26:40.857
I'm not worried about me dying
or Jordan Kenley dying.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.663
I'm worried about my hospital dying.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.337
I made some calls to replace Kenley.

26:51.376 --> 26:53.276
No one wants to come here.

26:53.311 --> 26:58.271
I can't keep a cardiac surgeon on staff.
Burke quit, Hahn quit, Dixon's autistic.

26:58.316 --> 27:01.513
My OR roof collapsed,
the whole place flooded.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.488
The interns are literally chopping
each other into pieces.

27:04.522 --> 27:07.286
No wonder we're number 12.
Twelve!

27:10.695 --> 27:14.290
I've failed at the one thing
I spent my whole life doing.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.595
Failed!

27:19.437 --> 27:21.905
So I'm going to stay right here
on this table

27:21.940 --> 27:25.671
until I find a way to walk the halls
without cringing.

27:35.086 --> 27:38.920
Aren't you supposed to give me that
"get back on the horse" lecture?

27:38.990 --> 27:42.551
I have got to stitch a serial killer
back together today.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.690
I don't have a rousing lecture in me.

28:05.784 --> 28:09.982
We're gonna need a strategy. Their
hot little eyes tracking our every move.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.479
OK. No casual glances
over the shoulder.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.016
No "this is interesting,
can everybody see?"

28:16.061 --> 28:17.756
Soon as Margaret's tumor's out,

28:17.829 --> 28:20.730
we'll have them take it
to pathology to get it analyzed.

28:20.765 --> 28:22.733
- Go team.
- Break.

28:30.075 --> 28:33.101
- They still not speaking?
- Doesn't look like it.

28:33.144 --> 28:37.012
- Wow. Two hours in an ice cave.
- Working on Seattle's man of the year.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.175
At least we got each other.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.414
We can pretend not to notice,
talk about the Seahawks.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.912
Or we could take off, go grab a beer,
let them pull out the shiv.

28:45.957 --> 28:47.891
Onward and upward.

28:53.565 --> 28:57.194
I don't think I was clear earlier.
It is not like a dream.

28:57.235 --> 29:00.693
I see Denny when I'm awake.
We hang out.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.606
This is because I said I loved you.
You're freaked out.

29:03.641 --> 29:06.041
- I'm not.
- You're a little freaked out.

29:06.778 --> 29:11.772
Um, we still do stuff together.

29:13.518 --> 29:17.716
Sex stuff. I see him, and we have sex.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.384
There's nothing wrong
with a good fantasy.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.954
I'd rather you fantasize about me,
or chicks.

29:25.997 --> 29:29.763
- But whatever.
- You really don't care?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.928
You're trying to work something out.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.098
People die, and then
the other people, you know...

29:35.573 --> 29:36.972
...get messed up about it.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.100
- Yeah, but...
- Iz.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.738
I've been competing with that tool
for a long time,

29:41.780 --> 29:44.476
but I'd say he's kinda got
the handicap now.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.781
I mean, is he here?
Can he see me do this?

29:48.787 --> 29:51.153
Yeah, dude, I can see you!

29:52.123 --> 29:54.023
And this?

29:58.296 --> 29:59.923
Is he still here?

30:00.565 --> 30:03.659
- I think you should go.
- Yeah, I got things to do.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.870
Do you see him now?

30:07.906 --> 30:11.603
No. No, he's gone.
Don't stop.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.668
- Don't stop!
- What about now?

30:13.711 --> 30:14.769
No, don't stop!

30:22.353 --> 30:24.446
Wow. Sharp.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.650
No wonder he was
complaining so much.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.285
He wasn't complaining after
he got 10 extra of morphine.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.626
- He got an extra 10 of morphine?
- It made him much more comfortable.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.531
Doesn't bother you this guy
probably hacked a family with a machete?

30:35.600 --> 30:40.503
A knife. And women, not a family.
Five women. It's what he likes.

30:40.538 --> 30:42.870
You shouldn't be on this case,
either of you.

30:42.907 --> 30:46.707
What's he gonna do, jump off the table
and get us? You're holding the knife.

30:49.414 --> 30:53.646
We'll be doing a nephrectomy. Either
of you ever mobilized the renal hilum?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.516
Never done one, but I'd love to try.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.987
I've practiced on cadavers
hundreds of times.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.252
It wouldn't be my first try.

31:00.291 --> 31:03.658
To some of us surgery comes naturally.
Others have to practice.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.428
You see the Seahawks game last week?

31:18.309 --> 31:22.803
- You know, I am the jealous type.
- I know. I'm sorry.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.943
I can't choose.
Please don't make me choose.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.848
Are you gonna make me?

31:31.422 --> 31:35.017
I can't do anything
that would make you unhappy.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.924
You know that.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.462
I love you.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.293
That's what you tell all the guys.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.234
You know today is my birthday?

31:53.044 --> 31:55.535
I do know that.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.208
You gonna get me a present?

32:01.819 --> 32:03.878
I think I just did.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.899
- Why is she shaking her head?
- Jackson's post-op LFTs.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.429
This kid needs to be put
on the transplant list today.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.304
- Just the intestine...?
- Liver too.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.139
We should get another opinion.

32:34.085 --> 32:37.077
Norman McCale at Hopkins.
Head of Pediatric Surgery.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.454
Tell him Arizona sent you. When he
tells you Jackson needs a transplant,

32:40.491 --> 32:43.824
which he'll do two minutes
into the call, put him on the list.

32:43.861 --> 32:46.853
- There's no need to snap at me.
- There is, actually.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.458
You've been second-guessing me.
I get it.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.492
You liked Dr. Kenley.
And I'm a stranger with a ponytail.

32:52.537 --> 32:55.199
But I'm not the problem, the patient is.

32:55.239 --> 32:58.208
So stop thinking about me
and start focusing on him.

32:58.242 --> 33:03.202
Jackson needs a transplant. If we keep
wasting time, he's not going to make it.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.814
You OK? Want to get a drink
or something?

33:37.849 --> 33:41.512
Oh, now we're on again,
'cause the mood suits you?

33:41.552 --> 33:43.918
I'm the sad little girl with no friend?

33:43.955 --> 33:46.253
I tripped your savior complex
into action?

33:46.290 --> 33:50.021
Usually, I can deal with the hot
and cold thing, but not today.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.130
Just leave me the hell alone.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.512
Is that him?

34:15.553 --> 34:19.455
- You ever find out what he did?
- It doesn't matter what he did.

34:19.489 --> 34:23.755
He did something really bad,
and he's gonna pay for it.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.556
- You want to get a drink?
- I'm not in the mood.

34:34.438 --> 34:36.873
You know, you and I
had a fight like this once.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.706
- What?
- Amsterdam.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.376
We used to be as close as you and
Cristina, then Amsterdam happened.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.976
You shut me down.
We never got past it.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.987
We still hung out, but not like before.

34:51.022 --> 34:54.321
We'd go dancing. Go someplace
loud, where we don't have to talk.

34:54.358 --> 34:57.987
That's OK.
I'm a rolling stone, I bounce.

34:58.029 --> 35:02.398
But you're about to do the same thing to
Cristina, and that girl mates for life.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.804
If you don't make it right,
she'll never talk to you again.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.833
I apologized. To Cristina.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.673
Like you meant it?

35:16.547 --> 35:19.209
Like you could imagine she had a point?

35:24.589 --> 35:26.284
I miss you.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.586
As my friend, I miss you.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.895
Now transplants aren't easy,
that's the bad news.

35:36.934 --> 35:38.731
But the good news is,

35:38.769 --> 35:43.263
you've got a crackerjack new doctor.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.674
I spoke to one of the most respected
kid surgeons in the country,

35:46.711 --> 35:48.679
and he thinks she's the best there is.

35:48.713 --> 35:51.807
So she's gonna take good care
of you. We all are.

35:59.357 --> 36:04.454
Why don't we go out and sign
some of the transplant consent forms?

36:34.592 --> 36:35.957
Stars and X's.

36:51.642 --> 36:55.476
Looking good. The surgery
couldn't have been smoother.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.505
- When could I get out of here?
- Soon.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.484
- You're young, you'll heal fast.
- Eager to get home?

37:04.155 --> 37:06.589
I'm going to Denver.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.967
- We did good work today.
- If we stay strong...

37:21.038 --> 37:24.439
- And don't get drunk...
- Keep staring at Joe, we'll be fine.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.975
Hi! Get you anything?

37:36.687 --> 37:39.986
- OK, you're weirding me out.
- You only live once.

37:40.024 --> 37:41.719
You can't waste it.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.296
No! No, Mark. No!

37:47.331 --> 37:49.299
Look at Joe. Look at me.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.233
Look at me. No!

37:51.269 --> 37:56.070
- Sorry, kid. I'm going to Denver.
- No! Mark, come back here!

37:56.107 --> 37:58.405
No, Mark, no!

38:13.324 --> 38:16.350
Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it!

38:20.498 --> 38:22.557
- You need another drink?
- Yes!

38:32.276 --> 38:36.212
She's all right. Arizona Robbins.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.080
Mm-hmm.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.316
I don't know if the patient's
going to make it, though.

38:54.699 --> 38:57.395
<i>We don't wish</i>
<i>for the easy stuff.</i>

38:58.736 --> 39:00.704
<i>We wish for big things.</i>

39:02.606 --> 39:04.938
<i>Things that are ambitious...</i>

39:06.410 --> 39:08.071
<i>...out of reach.</i>

39:16.987 --> 39:18.420
Let's take a look.

39:22.326 --> 39:26.023
He's got 10...

39:43.748 --> 39:48.708
Two guys shot my dad for his watch.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.744
My mom saved up for it.

39:51.689 --> 39:55.955
Two guys came into his store and
shot him 'cause he wouldn't give it up.

39:57.928 --> 40:00.226
That's how my dad died.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.993
We are supposed
to treat everybody the same.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.329
But they're not all the same.

40:11.275 --> 40:15.143
I'm sorry. It's a bad day
all around, I guess.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.949
I wish I could make things better
with you and Cristina.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.113
I wish you could, too.

40:25.122 --> 40:28.285
I try to think what she would do,
in a situation like this.

40:28.325 --> 40:30.350
I don't know.

40:31.362 --> 40:34.559
Well, she would turn
the music up pretty loud

40:34.598 --> 40:38.432
and she would dance it out with me,
but I don't think you want to go there.

40:38.469 --> 40:39.834
Well...

40:41.405 --> 40:43.202
...let's see what we got here.

40:47.178 --> 40:50.944
Whoo! Yeah! Look out!

40:50.981 --> 40:52.642
Hey! Come on, get up!

40:53.851 --> 40:56.752
Get your ass over here.
I'm not doing this by myself.

41:12.736 --> 41:13.794
There you go.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.772
<i>We wish because</i>
<i>we need help...</i>

41:24.882 --> 41:26.679
<i>...and we're scared...</i>

41:28.219 --> 41:31.586
<i>...and we know we may be</i>
<i>asking too much.</i>

41:31.622 --> 41:34.921
Oh, my God! You made it.

41:34.959 --> 41:39.089
Well, the cake tastes kind of funny,
but the frosting's pretty good.

41:39.129 --> 41:40.221
It's beautiful.

41:44.068 --> 41:47.333
It's a nice gesture,
him baking for you.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.236
Make a wish.

41:52.643 --> 41:55.043
What if I don't have anything
to wish for?

41:55.079 --> 41:58.640
What if I have everything
I could ever want?

41:58.682 --> 42:00.582
<i>We still wish, though.</i>

42:00.618 --> 42:03.519
Then wish that nothing changes.

42:03.554 --> 42:07.081
<i>Because... sometimes...</i>

42:08.025 --> 42:09.788
<i>...they come true.</i>
