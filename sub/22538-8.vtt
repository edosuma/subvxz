00:18.000 --> 00:21.200
DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THAT
"I'M OKAY, YOU'RE OKAY" CRAP!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.100
NOTHING'S OKAY, OKAY?!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.000
COPY THAT, CHIEF.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
THE FIRE CHIEF SAYS
THE OFFICE DOOR IS BARRICADED,

00:27.500 --> 00:30.000
AND THEY NEED TIME.
HEAR THAT, TYLER?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.900
BUY US SOME TIME.
OKAY.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.300
(amplified voice)
I HEAR YOU, RUBEN.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.800
WHY DON'T YOU CLIMB
BACK IN THE WINDOW

00:35.800 --> 00:38.000
AND TELL ME
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
WHAT'S ON MY MIND?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.800
PERSONAL PORTABLE PHONES...

00:43.800 --> 00:46.100
SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
IN A LARGE BRIEFCASE.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.500
I LOST EVERY PENNY I HAD
ON THAT DAMN COMPANY.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.500
WHAT AN IDIOT. WHO WANTS
TO CARRY AROUND A TELEPHONE?

00:54.500 --> 00:56.600
NO, RUBEN.
YOU'RE AHEAD OF YOUR TIME.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.800
ONE DAY EVERYBODY WILL HAVE

00:57.800 --> 01:00.700
ONE OF THESE... PORTABLE PHONES
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:00.700 --> 01:04.000
DON'T PATRONIZE ME!
DON'T YOU DO THAT!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.800
RUBEN, WAIT.
I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.700
I'VE LOST A LOT OF THINGS,
TOO.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.300
I KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TO FACE,
BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.400
THAT'S GOOD, TYLER.
TALK TO HIM LIKE A WOMAN.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.400
AH, NO.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.800
WHAT'S THE MATTER, EUGENE?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.100
YOU CAN'T GET THE KITTY
OUT OF THE TREE? (laughs)

01:29.800 --> 01:33.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
NUNZIO?
WE JUST GOT CAME BACK

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
WE HEARD THE CIRCUS
ON THE AIR,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.800
AND WE FIGURED WE'D COME
OVER HERE AND LEND A HAND.
WE DON'T NEED ANY HELP

01:39.800 --> 01:42.300
WHAT'S NEW, CARLING?
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.400
YOU MIGHT NEED IT
TO BLOW UP YOUR DATE TONIGHT.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.800
OH!
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, CARBONE.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.100
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR WIFE
SAID TO ME AFTER SHE HOPPED OFF.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.300
HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

01:54.500 --> 01:56.500
I CAN'T GO BACK TO WHAT I HAD.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.700
MY BANK ACCOUNT SAYS ZERO.
I'M WORTH ZERO.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.400
(Ruben) NOW <i>I'M</i> A ZERO!
HEY, EUGENE,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL, UH,

02:03.400 --> 02:04.700
YOUR WEBELO TO GIVE ME THE HORN
OVER THERE?

02:04.700 --> 02:10.300
I'LL TALK THIS LOSER DOWN
BEFORE HAPPY HOUR.
SAM, WE DON'T HAVE TIME

02:10.300 --> 02:12.500
THIS GUY IS SUICIDAL.
I GOT IT.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.700
THIS ISN'T THE TIME
FOR SOME STUPID COP STUNT.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.200
THIS GUY IS SUICIDAL.
WHO'S YOUR, UH,
NEW CENTER FIELDER, EUGENE?

02:18.200 --> 02:22.200
SAM TYLER, TRANSFER.
TYLER, ANTHONY NUNZIO,

02:22.200 --> 02:24.500
THE HARVESTER OF SORROW.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.900
THIS IS NO STUNT,
SAM TYLER.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.200
I HAVE A PROVEN
PERSUASION TECHNIQUE.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.700
IT'S A NEW FORM
OF REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.500
WHICH, WHEN, UH, USED
WITH HIGH-RISK NEGOTIATING,

02:33.500 --> 02:37.200
IS PROVING VERY EFFECTIVE.
WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
LIEUTENANT,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.200
THERE'S NO WAY I'M LETTING YOU
TALK TO HIM.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.800
(Ruben) WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN THERE? I'M GONNA JUMP.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.000
THIS IS IT!
WELL, YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING
REAL SOON, SAM TYLER,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
OR THIS GUY IS GONNA TURN
INTO GROUND GOO, TOUT SUITE.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.000
LET HIM HAVE A WHACK.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.200
AH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.800
RUBEN. WIFE LEFT HIM...

02:57.800 --> 03:00.000
AFTER HE LOST HIS SHIRT
IN THE STOCK MARKET...

03:00.000 --> 03:02.400
ON A PORTABLE PHONE COMPANY.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.100
WHO WANTS TO CARRY AROUND
A PHONE?
(scoffs)

03:05.400 --> 03:08.400
(Ruben) WHO ARE YOU?
(amplified voice)
HEY, RUBEN. HOW YOU DOING?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.400
GO AHEAD AND JUMP,

03:11.400 --> 03:14.500
YOU THINK WE GIVE A DAMN?
WHAT?!

03:14.500 --> 03:16.700
OH, BOSS.
NUNZIO.

03:16.700 --> 03:20.000
HEY, UH, YOUR WIFE CALLED...
ON THE PORTABLE PHONE.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.800
SHE CALLED TO TELL YOU
SHE SHACKED UP

03:21.800 --> 03:24.700
WITH THE GUY WHO INVENTED
THE PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER,

03:24.700 --> 03:27.100
AND SHE THINKS
YOU SHOULD JUMP, TOO.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.400
JUMP!
JUMP, YOU LOSER! JUMP!

03:29.400 --> 03:31.500
NUNZIO.
NO, DON'T DO IT, RUBEN!

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500

IS GOING ON THE STATS
OF THE 1-2-5,

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
ON THE LOOT'S SHEET.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.400
YOU MIND EXPLAINING THIS THING
BETWEEN NUNZIO AND HUNT?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.400
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS
HOW IT STARTED,

04:37.400 --> 04:40.600
BUT THOSE GUYS HAVE A RIVALRY
THAT'S AS LEGENDARY

04:40.600 --> 04:44.200

05:05.900 --> 05:08.400
AND THAT CRIME,
NO MATTER WHAT IT MAY BE,

05:08.400 --> 05:12.000
WILL BECOME A CONTEST
BETWEEN OUR TWO HOUSES.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.300
(Ray) THAT CRIME
WILL BE THE FIELD

05:14.300 --> 05:16.700
UPON WHICH A BATTLE
WILL BE WAGED.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.500
IT HAPPENS
ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.000
THE MEETING OF WARRIORS,

05:23.000 --> 05:27.700
LIKE "BEN-HUR" OR "SPARTACUS"
OR ANYONE IN THE MOVIES,

05:27.700 --> 05:30.000
WHERE DESPITE WEARING DRESSES
AND SANDALS,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.600

05:59.500 --> 06:01.400
BANK ROBBERY.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.200

06:39.300 --> 06:40.900
NO, YOU'RE NOT,

THE 1-2-5's CALLING SHOT

06:58.200 --> 07:03.000
AND ON ACCOUNT OF WHY?
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT JUMPER DYING
ON MY SHEET, COURTESY OF YOU.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
THAT JUMPER WAS ENDING UP
PAVEMENT PORRIDGE

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
NO MATTER WHO WAS
THE PRIMARY GABBER.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.600

TO EXPEDITE IT A BIT.
I'M CALLING SHOT.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.800
MAYBE WE TAKE THE MATTER UP

07:11.800 --> 07:13.900
WITH THE CHIEF OF D's FIRST,
HUH, EUGENE?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.100
I THINK WE JUST STEPPED
INTO THE STALINGRAD BRANCH

07:23.100 --> 07:25.700
OF THIS BANK.
WE'LL NEED SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS
NOW, BOSS.

07:25.700 --> 07:29.000
EVERY EYEWIT IN THE PLACE HAS
A CASE OF SPONTANEOUS BLINDNESS.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.600
THE SECURITY GUARD--
HE GOT PISTOL-WHIPPED

07:30.600 --> 07:34.300
AND WENT ON QUEER STREET.
THEY WERE THREATENED NOT
TO COOPERATE WITH THE COPS.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.100
PROBABLY ORGANIZED CRIME.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.000
KEEP TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE,
SIZEABLE.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.900
LET THEM KNOW
 <i>WE'RE</i> THE BIGGER THREAT.
A UNI FOUND THIS

07:42.900 --> 07:44.400
THREE ROUNDS RECENTLY FIRED.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.200
OUR PERP MAY HAVE TOSSED IT
ON HIS WAY OUT.
GOOD.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.400
LET'S RUN IT DOWN TO THE LAB,
SEE IF THEY CAN PULL D.N.A...

07:50.900 --> 07:53.100
LIFT SOME PRINTS.
I'M GONNA START A CANVASS.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.200
EVERYONE HERE
ONLY SPEAKS RUSSKI

07:58.200 --> 07:59.700
EXCEPT FOR THAT KID THERE.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.900
HE'S A REGULAR
WALTER CRONKITE.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.000
HIS MA DON'T SEEM TOO HAPPY.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.500
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE SAW THE WHOLE THING

08:05.500 --> 08:07.200
AND JUST TOLD ME SO,
AND ACCORDING TO HIM,

08:07.200 --> 08:10.200
THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROBBER.
(lowers voice) HUSTLE THE KID
BACK TO THE PRECINCT.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.500
WHAT ABOUT MOTHER RUSSIA THERE?
TAKE HER WITH YOU, BUT KEEP IT
ON THE HUSH-HUSH. GO. GO.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.300

08:22.500 --> 08:24.800
RAY'S TAKING 'EM OUT
FOR BANANA SPLITS.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.600
THE GUY GOT A BIG HEART.
HEY, LOOT. SAM SAYS
HE NEEDS YOU OUTSIDE.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.600
THE POOR LADY WAS
JUST WAITING FOR THE BUS.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.799
NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT HER.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.900
THE ROUND CAME
FROM INSIDE THE BANK, BOSS.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.600
LOOK AT THAT HOLE
IN THE WINDOW THERE.
STRAY BULLET.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.000
UNLUCKY.
I DOUBT THE SHOOTER EVEN KNOWS
HE DROPPED A BODY.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
HER NAME'S OLGA ARSHAVIN.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.800
GREEN CARD SAYS
SHE'S UKRAINIAN.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.000
WE GOT A FELONY MURDER HERE.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.100
 <i>WE</i> GOT A HOMICIDE HERE,
EUGENE.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.700
NOPE. NOW, WELL,
IT MAY BE TRUE

08:55.700 --> 08:59.500
THAT THE BANK IS WITHIN
THE JURISDICTION OF THE 1-4-4,

08:59.500 --> 09:03.600
THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, SEEING
AS HOW SHE IS ON THE SIDEWALK,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.300
PUTS US SQUARE IN THE 1-2-5.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.100
HUNTLANDIA.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.000
THIS IS OUR HOMICIDE.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.900
WELL, I GUESS WE GOT SOMETHING
WORTH FIGHTING FOR NOW, EUGENE.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.800

IF I TALK TO THE POLICE,

10:59.700 --> 11:01.100
I'LL BE IN TROUBLE.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.500
OH, YOUR MOM WAS JUST A LITTLE
BIT SCARED AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.400

11:28.200 --> 11:29.800
DON'T CLAM UP ON ME.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.800
TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW,

11:30.800 --> 11:33.800
AND I'LL BUY YOU
A BOWL OF BORSCHT.
LIEUTENANT...

11:36.900 --> 11:39.300
YOU'RE THE SOCIAL WORKER.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.600
GET THE KID TO SOCIALIZE.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.100
LEXI, YOU WON'T
GET IN TROUBLE.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.300
THEY JUST WANNA CATCH
THE MAN WITH THE GUN.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.600
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.900
HEY, LEXI...

11:55.700 --> 11:57.000
YOU WATCH "THE FLINTSTONES"?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.600
SEE THIS GUY?

12:00.100 --> 12:03.500
THEY BASED FRED FLINTSTONE
ON HIM.
NO, THEY DID NOT.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.400
(Sam) YES, THEY DID, LEXI.
I'M TELLING YOU.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.300
WHEN THEY WERE THINKING

12:06.300 --> 12:08.500
OF THE PERFECT CAVEMAN
FROM THE STONE AGE...

12:10.600 --> 12:14.700
GO AHEAD. SAY IT, GENE.
SAY IT FOR LEXI.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.300
OH, COME ON, GENE.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.200
JUST SAY IT.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.800
YABBA-DABBA-DOO!

12:31.700 --> 12:32.800
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.100
UH, LEXI,
DO YOU WANT A SODA POP?

12:35.100 --> 12:37.600
I'LL GET YOU ONE.
WAIT.

12:39.600 --> 12:43.000
HE SAID A BAD MAN WOULD KILL US
IF WE TALKED.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.500
YEAH? DID HE SAY
THE BAD MAN'S NAME?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.500
VASILLI LUKIN.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.600
THANK YOU, LEXI.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.000
(Maria) YEAH.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.800
THAT'S ONE HOT LITTLE MOUSE,
AIN'T IT?

13:07.800 --> 13:10.600
YOU SHOULD DRIZZLE SOME BUTTER
ON THEM TATERS.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.500
SHE'S NICE.
MM-HMM.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.300
WHAT'S HER STORY?
HER STORY IS
SHE'D LOOK PRETTY GOOD

13:17.300 --> 13:19.000
WITH HER TOES EXTENDED
TO THE CEILING.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.500
THAT'S HER STORY.
OH.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.700
OH.
RAY.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.700
WHAT?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.300
YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON THE ROBBERY?

13:25.300 --> 13:29.000
I RAN VASILLI LUKIN'S NAME BY
ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL BUREAU.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.900
THE GUY'S A RUSSKI MOBSTER THAT
JUST POPPED UP ON THEIR RADAR.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.300
RIGHT. RIGHT.

13:33.300 --> 13:38.300
IT'S 1973, SO THE RUSSIAN MOB IS
JUST STARTING TO ASSERT ITSELF.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.600
BUT ROBBING 10 GRAND
FROM A BANK--

13:39.600 --> 13:41.000
KINDA SMALL-TIME, ISN'T IT?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.600
10 GRAND BUYS
A LOT OF CHICKEN KIEV.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
I'M GUESSING LUKIN
IS HOOKED IN

13:45.600 --> 13:47.700
WITH THE SOVIETS
AND THE K.G.B.,

13:47.700 --> 13:48.600
KNOWING THESE SHIFTY REDS,

13:48.600 --> 13:53.800
WHICH MEANS THE KREMLIN
IS MAKING MOVE ON MANHATTAN.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.200
(chuckles)
A MOVE ON MANHATTAN?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.100
THERE'S A COLD WAR GOING ON,
SPACEMAN.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.400
AND I TELL YOU WHAT.
THIS IS ONE AMERICAN THAT

14:00.400 --> 14:03.500
AIN'T GONNA ROLL OVER AND START
FARMING ON NO VODKA COLLECTIVE.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.500
RIGHT.
SO YOU THINK THE SOVIETS

14:05.500 --> 14:08.000
ARE PLOTTING
TO TAKE OVER THE U.S.
YOU DON'T?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.300
OH.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.800
DID O.C.C.B. HAPPEN TO MENTION
WHERE WE COULD FIND LUKIN?

14:13.800 --> 14:15.200
YES, THEY DID.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.600
VASILLI LUKIN?
(mouths word)

14:32.400 --> 14:34.800
WONDERFUL. MORE POLICE.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MORE?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.900
OH! IF IT ISN'T
GENIE-COME-LATELY.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.100
YOU'RE ONE STEP AHEAD
OF NOBODY.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.800
I INTERVIEWED MR. LUKIN
PERSONALLY, LIEUTENANT HUNT.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.700
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ROBBERY.
AN ENTIRE PLANET

14:55.700 --> 14:57.600
AND THIS BANK ROBBER
JUST HAPPENS TO MENTION

14:57.600 --> 14:59.700
THE NAME "VASILLI LUKIN"?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.800
I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS CRIMINAL
WOULD SAY MY NAME

15:01.800 --> 15:06.800
DURING ROBBERY.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CRIME.
MAYBE ONE OF YOUR GOONS WAS

15:06.800 --> 15:11.200
YOU ARE RUDE. WHAT YOU SAY WOULD
SUGGEST MR. LUKIN KEEPS GOONS?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.900
I APOLOGIZE
FOR DETECTIVE TYLER.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.400
HE'S SORT OF AN IMMIGRANT
TO THIS TOWN HIMSELF.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.600
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.600
WE ARE ALL IN MELTING POT.
SO I ACCEPT THE APOLOGY.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.000
LOOK AT HIM.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.800
IT'S CAPTAIN AMERICA.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.200
YOU LIKE APPLE PIE,
CAPTAIN AMERICA?

15:27.200 --> 15:31.300
YOU HAVE FACE OF APPLE PIE.
NOW WHO'S BEING RUDE?

15:33.100 --> 15:34.400
DO US A FAVOR.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.900
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.800
THOSE SHOES--IT'S A KIEV DOG
WHO DRESS LIKE THAT.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.500
SOUNDS LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE HIM.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.200
NO, NO. IT'S... THOSE SHOES.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.000
ONLY RUSSIAN
OFF THE BOAT FROM KIEV

15:55.000 --> 15:56.900
WOULD WEAR SOMETHING
SO SILLY.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.200
NO ONE WHO WORK FOR ME.
OH.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.100
 <i>IF</i> YOU'RE TIED
INTO THIS ROBBERY,

16:04.100 --> 16:07.000
YOU CAN KISS "FREE"
GOOD-BYE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.900
YOU MAKE THREAT,
DETECTIVE?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.300
LIEUTENANT, COMRADE.

16:10.300 --> 16:14.000
LIEUTENANT HUNT ISN'T USED
TO SAYING GOOD-BYE HIMSELF.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.400
MAYBE HE'LL BE ON HIS WAY.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.500
 <i>DA.</i>
THAT IS GOOD IDEA FOR HIM.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.300
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.800
ENJOY THE <i>SCHVITZ.</i>

16:26.000 --> 16:27.600
 <i>DO SVIDANIYA...</i>

16:27.800 --> 16:29.200
APPLE PIE.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.700
OH. THANKS, ANNIE.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.200
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MARIA?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.400
OH, YOU KNOW...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.900
DOING MY BEST TO KEEP
ALL THE CHILDREN SINGIN'.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.600
I HEARD YOU AND GARY
SPLIT UP.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
WE DID.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.200
GARY TURNED OUT TO BE LESS GARY
THAN I SIGNED UP FOR.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.000
I'M SORRY.
HOW'S WORKING
WITH DETECTIVE TYLER?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.400
SAM? OH, HE'S NICE.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.500
GOOD GUY.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.700
(coins jingle)
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
MADE A MOVE YET, ANNIE?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.099
(liquid pours)
A MOVE?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
ON SAM?

17:17.400 --> 17:19.599
WELL, NO, I...

17:19.599 --> 17:21.599
THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.700
AND WE WORK TOGETHER.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.300
AND BESIDES,
I AM SEEING SOMEONE.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.100
UH, LEE CROCKER.
YOU KNOW HIM?

17:29.100 --> 17:31.500
YEAH, I KNOW LEE.
NICE MAN.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.400
YES.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.800
AND WHY ARE YOU BLUSHING?

17:34.800 --> 17:38.000
BLUSHING?
I'M NOT BLUSHING, MARIA.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.300
I'M... NATURALLY PINKISH.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.500
IS SAM INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.800
HE DOES, UH,
MENTION A GIRLFRIEND,

17:47.800 --> 17:50.700
BUT SHE'S FAR, FAR AWAY.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.600
MAYA.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.300
FAR AWAY MAYA.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.700
SO HE'S FAIR GAME?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.100
FREE AND CLEAR,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.300
THE WAY LUKIN AND HIS BODYGUARD
LOOKED AT THIS PHOTO,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.700
THEY KNEW
WHO WAS UNDER THE MASK.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.600
THEY KNOW
WHO PULLED OFF THIS ROBBERY.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.900
ALL YOU GOTTA KNOW, TYLER, IS
THAT HE'S A RUSSKI, ALL RIGHT?

18:16.900 --> 18:19.000
THEY WANT EVERYTHING TO BE FREE,
EVEN MONEY.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.400
TURNS OUT THAT THE GUN
FOUND AT THE SEWER SEARCH

18:21.400 --> 18:23.500
HAS AN OWNER.
HIS NAME IS YURI DEMIDOV.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.600
HE PURCHASED THE GUN
AT FRED'S HUNTING EMPORIUM

18:25.600 --> 18:28.900
IN BAY RIDGE TWO WEEKS AGO.
YURI, HUH?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.500
WELL, AS THE GRAY-HAIRED
GRANNIES DOWN AT CHURCH SAY,

18:31.500 --> 18:33.600
"BINGO."
YOU GOT A HOME ADDRESS?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.900
(lowered voice)
HO! COME HERE. GET DOWN.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.000
NUNZIO BEAT US TO IT.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.400
THAT'S HIS BOAT.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.000
OH, I KNOW HIM LIKE
THE BACK OF MY "GOOLIES."

18:56.000 --> 18:59.600
HE'S GETTING YURI READY FOR SOME
PRE-INTERROGATION TENDERIZING.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.800
SO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
WE INTERVENE, BOSS?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.900
OPERATION: BLUE CONDOR.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.500
WHAT'S OPERATION: BLUE CONDOR?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.800
PICTURE YOU'RE ON A CHOO-CHOO.
WE'RE THE LAST STOP.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
YOU'RE UP TO YOUR ASS
IN ALLIGATORS.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.300
I WOULDN'T EAT SPAGHETTI
OFF YOUR HEAD.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.600
AFTER TONIGHT, DR. ZHIVAGO,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.300
YOU'LL WISH YOU WERE MAKING
PICKAX ICE CUBES

19:21.300 --> 19:23.300
IN A SIBERIAN GULAG.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.100
COME IN.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.300
WHAT IS IT?
SOMEONE'S MESSING
WITH YOUR CAR DOWNSTAIRS.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.900
(scoffs)
MAKE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.600
"P.A.B."?

20:03.100 --> 20:05.200
PITTSBURGH ASSOCIATION
OF BROADCAST.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.900
REALLY? THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.700
PEANUT ADVISORY BOARD.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.000
HOW ABOUT
"PLEASE AVOID BREATHING"?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.200
(chuckles)
OPERATION: BLUE CONDOR.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.600
WHAT'S THAT?
HUNT.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
"P.A.B."--

20:37.000 --> 20:38.700
PAYBACK'S A BITCH.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.700
WE JUST WALKED THEM
OUT THE BACK

20:43.700 --> 20:47.100
LIKE WE WAS TAKING THEM
TO THE PROM. (chuckles)
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
WHY IT'S CALLED
OPERATION: BLUE CONDOR.

20:49.100 --> 20:53.600
I AGREE. WE SHOULD CALL IT
OPERATION: UP YOUR ASS, NUNZIO.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.400
YOU'RE STILL HERE.
I HAD TO FILE MY REPORT.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.300
RIGHT.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.500
WHY THE AWKWARD DISPLAY
OF EUPHORIA?

21:04.500 --> 21:08.400
WELL, THE--THE 1-4-4 NABBED OUR
SUSPECT IN THE BANK MURDER...

21:08.400 --> 21:11.700
AND WE NABBED HIM BACK.
THAT'S GREAT.
MAYBE NEXT TIME

21:11.700 --> 21:14.000
YOU CAN CHALLENGE THEM
TO A WATER BALLOON FIGHT.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.600
I MEAN, HOW MUCH OF THIS IS
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS CITY

21:16.600 --> 21:20.600
AND HOW MUCH OF THIS IS
ABOUT WILLIE SIZE?
IT'S ABOUT

21:20.600 --> 21:21.400
OUR WILLIES ARE--

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
OUR WILLIES ARE GOOD WILLIES.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.800
YES, IT'S TRUE.
WE HAVE GOOD WILLIES.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.800
YEAH, VERY GOOD WILLIES.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.200
GOOD-BYE, GENTLEMEN.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.300
GOOD-BYE, DETECTIVE TYLER.
GOOD-BYE.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.300
"GOOD-BYE, DETECTIVE TYLER."

21:42.700 --> 21:43.900
WHAT?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.700
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU,
SPACEMAN.

21:45.700 --> 21:50.000
WHAT, HER? NO.
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.
COME ON.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.900
I WOULD CRAWL ACROSS
HALF A MILE OF BROKEN GLASS

21:52.900 --> 21:56.000
JUST TO KISS THE LAST GUY
WHO SUCKED HER TOES.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.600
WH-WHAT?
NO.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.000
WHERE'S KING FAROUQ?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.500
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THICKHEADED ENOUGH

22:08.500 --> 22:11.200
TO STEAL A SUSPECT, EUGENE.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.300
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE MOPE ENOUGH

22:13.300 --> 22:18.000
TO LET ONE GET STOLEN.
YOU PUG-FACED,
LITTLE SISSY MARY.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.500
I WILL TURN THIS PRECINCT
INTO A PARKING LOT.

22:21.500 --> 22:25.700
WHO? YOU? YOU COULDN'T FIND SAND
IF YOU SLID OFF A CAMEL.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.600
I DON'T HAVE MY ABACUS HANDY,
NUNZIO,

22:29.600 --> 22:32.900
BUT I DON'T THINK THE NUMBERS
ARE IN YOUR FAVOR FOR A RUMBLE.

22:32.900 --> 22:36.900
LOOK AT YOU, ALL SWELLED UP
LIKE A POISON PUP.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.800
I'M GLAD I'M OFF THIS CASE.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.000
GIVES THE 1-2-5
A CHANCE TO BLOW IT.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.700
COME ON, BOYS.
LET'S BEAT IT.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.600
THIS THING BETWEEN YOU AND HIM
GOES WAY BEYOND SQUAD RIVALRY.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
WHAT'S--WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.300
GET BACK TO WORK, TYLER.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.400
IT'LL BE IN MY OFFICE.
(telephone rings)

23:12.300 --> 23:14.000
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL,
WASN'T IT?

23:14.800 --> 23:16.300
(liquid pours)
TELL ME A STORY THAT WASN'T.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.500
COME ON. A 30-YEAR BEEF?

23:18.500 --> 23:21.000
(chuckles)
RAISING FISTS EVERY TIME
YOU SNIFF EACH OTHER?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.800
OVER A WOMAN?
YEAH, FINE.
YOU COULD FRAME IT THAT WAY,

23:24.800 --> 23:28.200
IF YOU WERE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO THINKS WORLD WAR II STARTED

23:28.200 --> 23:30.900
OVER A-A PARCEL OF LAND
FULL OF POLISH PEOPLE.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.600
I-I DON'T FOLLOW.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.600
ANGELA VENEZZIA.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.900
ITALIAN GIRL.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.900
SHE WASN'T A WOMAN.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.800
SHE WAS <i>BEYOND</i> A WOMAN.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.300
I'M PRETTY SURE GOD INVENTED HER
WHEN MRS. GOD WASN'T LOOKING.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.700
I WENT TO A KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
DANCE, ME AND NUNZ.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.900
WE WERE TIGHT BACK THEN.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.000
BOTH SAW HER
AT THE SAME TIME.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.100
PART GYPSY...

24:01.900 --> 24:03.800
(chuckles) PART WEREWOLF.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.200
ONLY HE CALLED SHOT ON HER.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.600
IN THOSE DAYS, HE'D CALL SHOT
ON A FIRE HYDRANT.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.200
AND ANGELA CHOSE YOU?

24:15.800 --> 24:18.600
HEY. DON'T--
DON'T LOOK SO SURPRISED.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.700
I HAVE
SOME LOVABLE QUALITIES.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.900
DEEPLY SUBLIMATED,
THOUGH THEY MAY BE...

24:22.900 --> 24:24.100
AH...

24:29.500 --> 24:31.900
THE THING ABOUT THIS...

24:31.900 --> 24:34.900
THERE ARE WOMEN YOU LOVE
AND THEY LOVE YOU BACK.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.500
SOMETIMES THERE ARE
WOMEN YOU LOVE...

24:38.600 --> 24:40.300
THEY DON'T FEEL THE SAME.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.600
I NEVER HAD ANGELA...

24:45.900 --> 24:47.700
NOT THE WAY YOU'D WANT...

24:48.300 --> 24:50.000
AND I ALWAYS KNEW IT.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
SHE NEVER BURNED FOR ME,

24:56.400 --> 24:59.700
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
I SET MYSELF ON FIRE FOR HER.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.900
SHE NEVER BURNED FOR ME.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.100
SHE LEFT ME A FEW YEARS
AFTER WE GOT MARRIED.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.400
I'M SORRY, GENE.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.800
NO, IT'S NOT ALL TEARDROPS
AND VIOLINS.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.200
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.400
WE HAD THREE GREAT KIDS.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.500
GET OUTTA HERE, TYLER.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.500
GET OUT.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.500
ARE YOU GOING TO BEAT ME

25:53.500 --> 25:56.300
LIKE OTHER POLICE OF AMERICA?

25:57.400 --> 26:00.800
IF YOU TRY TO HUSTLE US,
I WON'T STOP HIM.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.300
HE THINKS THE RUSSIANS ARE
POISONING OUR WATER SUPPLY.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.800
THEY ARE NOT,
BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.800
(slams table)
OLGA ARSHAVIN DIED,
HERRING FACE,

26:10.800 --> 26:14.200
'CAUSE <i>YOU</i> PLAYED COWBOY
BANK ROBBER THIS MORNING.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.400
NOT ME.
"NOT ME"?

26:17.700 --> 26:19.600
WE CAN PLACE YOU AT THE BANK,
YURI,

26:21.200 --> 26:23.000
WITH THESE SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.400
THIS MAN IN PHOTO WEARS MASK.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.100
UH, H-HOW ARE YOU
TO SAY THAT'S ME?

26:28.100 --> 26:31.800
ALL THE MASKS IN THE WORLD
CAN'T HIDE THEM UGLY SHOES, RED.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.800
EVEN STALIN HAD THE DECENCY
TO WEAR A NICE TASSEL LOAFER.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.300
THE GUY IN THIS PICTURE
DOESN'T ROB BANKS

26:45.300 --> 26:47.900
OR MURDER SOMEONE
WITHOUT A GOOD REASON.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.800
SO WHY'D YOU DO IT?

26:52.300 --> 26:55.300
WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUDGE,
JUST TO LISTEN.

26:56.700 --> 26:57.500
OKAY.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
SO COME ON, YURI.
TALK TO US.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.500
I DEFECT, UH, TO AMERICA
ONE MONTH AGO.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.500
I WAS ENGINEER IN KIEV.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.900
I ARRIVE HERE
TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS

27:12.900 --> 27:16.500
TO BRING MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER
TO AMERICA.

27:16.500 --> 27:21.200
KIEV POLICE AND K.G.B. WATCH
MY FAMILY SO THEY CAN'T LEAVE.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.700
GETTING THEM HERE TO THE U.S.
IS DIFFICULT TASK.

27:24.700 --> 27:28.100
I TURN TO NOT-SO-NICE MAN
FOR HELP.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.400
VASILLI LUKIN.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.600
I PAID HIM $10,000.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
WHEN THEY ARRIVE HERE,
HE ASK FOR ANOTHER $10,000.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.100
ANOTHER $10,000 FOR WHAT?

27:36.100 --> 27:40.400
EXCHANGE FOR MY FAMILY,
MARINA AND DASHA.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.900
SO I...

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
I...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.700
I ROB THE BANK.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.000
WHERE'S LUKIN
KEEPING YOUR FAMILY NOW?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.700
I DO NOT KNOW,
BUT HE SAID HE WILL KILL THEM...

28:00.000 --> 28:05.200
IF I DO NOT BRING $10,000 MORE
BY SATURDAY.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.800
WE'RE NARROWING DOWN
POSSIBILITIES

28:13.800 --> 28:15.800
ON WHERE LUKIN'S
HOLDING YOUR FAMILY.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.500
I HOPE YOU LIKE ROAST BEEF.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.100
I NEVER MEANT
TO SHOOT THAT WOMAN.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.300
BUT YOU DID, YURI.
(handcuffs unlock)

28:27.900 --> 28:29.500
AND YOU HAVE
TO ANSWER FOR THAT.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.400
IT WAS FIRST TIME
I EVER HELD A GUN.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.500
I WAS...

28:34.500 --> 28:38.100
I WAS ENGINEER
FOR SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.000
IN RUSSIA, I AM SCIENTIST.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.100
IN AMERICA, I ROB BANKS.

28:42.100 --> 28:45.000
SAD IMMIGRANT TALE.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.100
YEAH.

28:46.100 --> 28:49.200
I CONSIDER MYSELF
THE ULTIMATE IMMIGRANT.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.700
HOW CAN THIS BE?
YOU LOOK TRUE BLUE.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.100
(chuckles)
WHERE YOU FROM?

28:53.100 --> 28:55.600
OH, FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.400
WHY <i>DID</i> YOU LEAVE?

29:02.500 --> 29:05.500
MY WORK INVOLVED
PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS,

29:05.500 --> 29:08.200

OF BRAIN ALPHA WAVES,

29:08.700 --> 29:10.700
THE MATERIAL OF MEMORY.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.800

FOR PROJECT ARIES.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.900
WE SEND MINIATURE ROBOT

THE EXISTENCE OF A...
HUMAN SOUL.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
HUMAN SOUL?

29:32.500 --> 29:33.600
HUMAN SOUL.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.100
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

29:36.900 --> 29:38.900
RESULTS INCONCLUSIVE.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.100
I CAN SEE YOU ARE SAD
AT BEING IMMIGRANT.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.200
 <i>(whirring and radio static</i>
 <i>continues)</i>
THERE IS ADVANTAGE.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.500
A NEW LIFE
CAN SET YOU FREE.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.200
DO THE THINGS YOU WOULD NOT DO
IN YOUR OLD LIFE.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.300
EMBRACE
YOUR IMMIGRANT STATUS.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.500
YOU CAN BE
ANYTHING YOU WANT HERE.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.800
 <i>THIS</i> IS TRUE GIFT

30:19.400 --> 30:21.600
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE
ASKING FOR HELP

30:21.600 --> 30:24.100
AFTER THAT SHINE
YOU PULLED ON US TODAY, EUGENE.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.900
WHY YOU GOTTA ALWAYS
WITH THE "EUGENE"?

30:26.900 --> 30:29.000
NOW YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE THAT, ANTHONY.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.300
I WOULDN'T DO IT
IF I DIDN'T THINK

30:30.300 --> 30:32.400
IT STUCK UP IN YOUR THROAT
LIKE A SORE.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.700
THIS GUY, THE BANK ROBBER--
HE WAS TRYING TO PAY

30:37.700 --> 30:40.000
THE RUSSIAN GANGSTER LUKIN
A DEBT.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.900
LUKIN SMUGGLED THE GUY'S FAMILY
INTO NEW YORK,

30:41.900 --> 30:43.500
AND NOW
HE'S HOLDING THEM HOSTAGE.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.200
AND WHY IS THIS DILEMMA?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.200
WELL, LUKIN'S IN YOUR PRECINCT.
YOU KNOW HIS HAUNTS.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.600
WHERE WOULD HE HIDE
THE GUY'S FAMILY?
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON

30:51.600 --> 30:55.300
"GIVE ME" DIED.
I'M HIS BROTHER "TAKE."

30:55.300 --> 30:57.900
THIS FAMILY NEEDS OUR HELP.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.200
MY WHOLE CAREER

30:59.200 --> 31:01.300
YOU'VE BEEN RAMRODDING ME,
EUGENE.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.600
AH.
THAT BANK HEIST A FEW YEARS AGO?
THAT WAS MY CASE.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.000
 <i>MY</i> CASE. YOU STOLE IT.
I STOLE IT BECAUSE
AT THE POLICEMAN'S BALL

31:07.000 --> 31:10.100
YOU TOLD THE CHIEF
MY SQUAD COULDN'T CLEAR PIMPLES.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.900
YOU SWIPED
THE BROWNSTONE ROBBERY--

31:12.900 --> 31:14.700
THE PUERTO RICANS?
AND BEFORE THAT,

31:14.700 --> 31:17.200
YOU SNATCHED THE RAPE
AND THE GANG STABBING ON 3rd.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.500
HOW FAR DO YOU WANT
TO GO BACK?

31:18.500 --> 31:23.400
ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS? 1943.
I SAW HER FIRST. <i>I</i> CALLED SHOT.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.800
ANGELA WAS AN ADULT.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.600
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
I'M SORRY SHE PICKED ME?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.800
YOU GOT A BETTER SHOT

31:29.800 --> 31:32.600
AT GROWING BEETS
ON A TULIP FARM.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.100
I DON'T WANT AN APOLOGY.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.600
SEE, THE WAY I FIGURE IT,
I GOT ONE LESS BROKEN HEART

31:38.600 --> 31:41.500
BECAUSE OF YOU
SHUTTIN' OFF THOSE LIGHTS.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.600
THERE'S A FAMILY'S LIFE
AT STAKE HERE, ANTHONY.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
YEAH, THEY'RE RUSSKIES,

31:48.600 --> 31:52.400
BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THEY SHOULD
BE DENIED SOME FUN IN THE SUN.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.100
NOT ON OUR ACCOUNT, ANYWAYS.

32:03.700 --> 32:06.700
LUKIN OWNS THE APARTMENTS
ABOVE THE BATHHOUSE.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.300
I'D START THERE.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.100
LOOK AT YOU,
ACTING LIKE A GROWN-UP.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.300
DON'T GET USED TO IT...

32:18.700 --> 32:20.100
 <i>EUGENE.</i>

32:24.700 --> 32:26.100
DETECTIVE TYLER.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.700
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:28.700 --> 32:30.900
I WAS LOOKING
FOR LIEUTENANT HUNT.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.800
OH, I THINK HE'S OUT, UM,
ON A CASE.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.000
OH.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.600
YEP.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.800
HEY, NICE JOB TODAY.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.600
IT WAS CUTE.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.500
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.300
OH, YEAH. I'M EMBRACING
MY IMMIGRANT STATUS.
OKAY.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.900
SAFETY FIRST.
RIGHT.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.100

33:21.100 --> 33:22.800
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.700
YOU'RE NICE, SAM TYLER.

33:30.700 --> 33:33.000
YES. I MEAN, YOU ARE...

33:33.500 --> 33:34.500

33:38.200 --> 33:39.200

33:43.700 --> 33:45.600
HI.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.900

33:48.500 --> 33:49.700
HMM? OH.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
YEAH. THANKS, I HAD, UH--
FRENCH FRIES.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.400
FRENCH FRIES. YES.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
I SHOULD, UM...
GO. THERE.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.900
YEAH.
GO.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.600
THERE YOU ARE, SPACEMAN.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.000
WE WERE ABOUT TO SEND OUT
THE BLOODHOUNDS.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.400
WELL, I STEPPED OUT
FOR SOME AIR.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
 <i>YEAH.</i>

34:13.900 --> 34:15.800

34:16.900 --> 34:18.800
WHERE THE RUSSIANS
WERE KEEPING YURI'S FAMILY.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.300
THERE'S A, UH, APARTMENT
ABOVE THE <i>SCHVITZ.</i>

34:21.300 --> 34:23.300

A CLOSE EYE ON 'EM.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.500
WHAT NOW... LIEUTENANT?

34:34.800 --> 34:38.300

JUST CAME TO GIVE YOU SOME NEWS.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.699

34:45.000 --> 34:48.500
MURDER?
THE DEAD WOMAN
FROM THE BANK ROBBERY?

34:48.500 --> 34:49.800
SEE, THE WAY
THE LAW WORKS IS,

34:49.800 --> 34:52.500
WHEN YOU THREATEN A GUY TO PAY
MONEY, AND THAT GUY ROBS A BANK

34:52.500 --> 34:56.800
AND SHOOTS SOMEONE,
THE BODY COMES BACK TO YOU.
NO PROOF.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.000
LIKE K.G.B.,
YOU FALSIFY STATEMENTS.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.600
ARE YOU GONNA
COME ALONG QUIETLY OR RESIST?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.500
I'M <i>HOPING</i> YOU RESIST.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.100
I HAVEN'T SMACKED AROUND
A COMMIE SINCE THE McCARTHY ERA.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.900
RESIST?

35:09.900 --> 35:13.600
IN MOSCOW, REAL POLICE
NEVER POINT GUNS.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.800
YOU WOULDN'T TALK SO MUCH,
BIG MOUTH,

35:18.900 --> 35:21.300
I DON'T NEED MY GUN
TO TAKE YOU IN.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.300
YOU NEED YOUR GUN?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

NOT WHEN I GOT
ALL TEN SOLDIERS.

VODKA IS FOR SISSIES.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.500

35:44.000 --> 35:45.500

35:46.300 --> 35:49.500
I THINK MAYBE
WE OVERPLAYED THIS ONE, BOSS.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.800
IT HAPPENS.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.000
OOH! EUGENE!

35:56.000 --> 35:58.800
I FIGURED I'D FIND YOU
CHOMPIN' ON A PASTRAMI SANDWICH

35:58.800 --> 36:00.900

36:53.000 --> 36:56.500

36:56.500 --> 37:00.500
* AND HIS MONEY
HE WAS COUNTIN' *

37:00.500 --> 37:04.200
* I FIRST PRODUCED MY PISTOL 

37:04.200 --> 37:07.800
* AND THEN PRODUCED MY RAPIER 

37:07.800 --> 37:11.500
* I SAID,
"STAND O'ER AND DELIVER *

37:11.500 --> 37:15.400
* OR THE DEVIL,
HE MAY TAKE YA" *

37:15.400 --> 37:20.200

37:28.000 --> 37:29.900
HOW'D YOU LIKE <i>THAT</i>
FOR APPLE PIE?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.300
* I TOOK ALL OF HIS MONEY 

37:41.300 --> 37:45.100
* AND IT WAS A PRETTY PENNY 

37:45.100 --> 37:49.000
* I TOOK ALL OF HIS MONEY 

37:49.000 --> 37:52.700
* AND I BROUGHT IT HOME
TO MOLLY *

37:53.500 --> 37:54.700
THEY'LL BE SAFE NOW.

37:54.700 --> 37:57.900
I JUST TOLD MY DAUGHTER SHE CAN
BE ANYTHING SHE WANTS HERE.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.700
IT'S A NEW LIFE.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.300
IT'S A NEW AMERICA.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.400
HEY, I GOT IT. MM-HMM.

38:12.500 --> 38:19.400

38:37.600 --> 38:38.600

38:41.900 --> 38:43.600
WELL, I'VE BEEN...

38:44.000 --> 38:45.500
WANTING TO TALK TO YOU.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.900
AS A FRIEND, BUT...

38:48.500 --> 38:49.500
WELL, I DIDN'T...

38:49.500 --> 38:52.400
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK THAT I WAS--
COME HERE, NO-NUTS.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.600
DANCE WITH THE MAN
THAT BEATS UP RUSSIAN.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.800
THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE
MORE THAN YOU, NUNZ,

39:02.800 --> 39:05.000
ARE THE BAD GUYS.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.800

39:21.600 --> 39:22.600

39:35.800 --> 39:38.500
AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH...
(sighs)

39:38.500 --> 39:40.600
LOSING YOUR MA
TO THAT MANIAC.

39:40.600 --> 39:44.900
 <i>YOU</i> HAD TO GROW UP TO BE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING?

39:44.900 --> 39:46.500
WELL, LOOK AT THIS WAY, NUNZ.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.700
IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN MY DAD
INSTEAD OF GENE,

39:48.700 --> 39:51.300
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
TURNED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.400
 <i>* MY MARIA </i>

39:57.400 --> 40:03.600
 <i>* DON'T YOU KNOW</i>

40:03.600 --> 40:05.700
 <i>* I'VE BEEN LONGIN'</i>
 <i>TO SEE HER *</i>

40:05.700 --> 40:10.200

THE BOSS' DAUGHTER, SPACEMAN.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.500

TO GET AHEAD IN AMERICA.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.400
GOD BLESS.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.400
 <i>* I'M A LONELY DREAMER</i>
