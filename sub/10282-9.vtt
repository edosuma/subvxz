00:05.673 --> 00:07.741
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.775 --> 00:08.642
How's your dad doing?

00:08.676 --> 00:10.111
Okay.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.779
Got a nurse for him
16 hours a day,

00:11.812 --> 00:13.714
and then from 11:00 to 7:00
it's just me.

00:13.747 --> 00:14.615
What happened
there, doctor?

00:14.648 --> 00:15.483
That was your patient.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.650
No, it's a trauma.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.319
No medical record number yet,
thanks.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.088
Don't say please
and thank you to
the blood bank,

00:20.121 --> 00:21.322
and don't let
the boys bully you.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.124
I wa... I wasn't
letting the boys...

00:23.157 --> 00:24.358
You play with
your hair when
you're nervous.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.160
Want to get
some dinner?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.096
Thanks. I have
plans already.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.130
Okay.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.231
Not with anyone,
if that's

00:30.264 --> 00:30.831
what you're
wondering.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.832
Not a problem.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.167
You abandoned
that kid.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.168
My shift was over.

00:34.202 --> 00:34.835
He was counting on you.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.404
I had a gig.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.739
Screw your gig!
Medicine isn't
a day job!

00:44.578 --> 00:47.181
DR. CHEN:
Jing-Mei!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.185
Jing-Mei!

00:51.219 --> 00:54.322
( speaks Chinese )

00:54.355 --> 00:56.490
( speaks Chinese )

00:56.524 --> 00:57.491
( glass shatters )

00:57.525 --> 00:59.260
Papa?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.129
Papa?!

01:01.129 --> 01:03.464
( panting )

01:03.497 --> 01:05.366
Come when I call you.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.568
Why do you do this?

01:07.601 --> 01:08.636
( speaks Chinese )

01:12.273 --> 01:15.809
( speaks Chinese )

01:15.843 --> 01:18.446
( speaks Chinese )

01:26.454 --> 01:28.456
Please?

01:28.489 --> 01:33.161
Papa, I can't.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.395
( speaks Chinese )

01:34.428 --> 01:40.434
( speaks Chinese )

01:44.372 --> 01:46.807
Jing-Mei.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.180
Okay.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.216
Okay.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.517
I promise.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.288
So how come your brother's
staying with you?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.322
Your parents
live in Winnetka.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.556
Ben's in the Peace Corps.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.591
My parents are always
bugging him

02:03.624 --> 02:04.658
to get a real job.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.327
That sounds familiar.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.295
If I can just get
the sofa bed.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.863
They're checking
to see if we have
it in stock.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.732
All right. Thanks.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.201
You the youngest?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.368
No, oldest.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.836
Ben and my
little sister Tess.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.206
She's a junior partner
in my dad's firm.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.673
I wonder who
the favorite is.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.409
Hmm. Do you have
siblings?

02:21.442 --> 02:22.910
My brother died
when I was 11.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.312
I'm sorry.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.314
We have the sofa bed
in stock,

02:26.347 --> 02:28.416
but only in moss green,
not black.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.483
All right,
green's fine.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.818
Can you deliver it
today?

02:30.851 --> 02:31.885
On Christmas Eve?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.521
Mm-hmm.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.822
I could probably tie that
to the roof of the car.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.590
You think?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.226
( scoffs ):
It's why you brought me along,

02:38.259 --> 02:39.493
isn't it? A little brawn?

02:39.527 --> 02:42.296
We'll take it.
I'll go pay.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.731
I'll go find some rope.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.798
Meet you at the checkout.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.834
All right, thanks.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.942
Can you say anything?
Can you talk?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.346
Okay, you're choking,

02:58.379 --> 02:59.813
so I'm going to do this
really hard, okay?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.851
( gasping ):
Mom!

03:03.884 --> 03:05.886
( speaking Farsi )

03:05.919 --> 03:07.455
No, no, it's okay.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.423
I was actually
helping her.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.625
She was choking
on the little piece....
I'm a doc...

03:11.659 --> 03:13.861
I think we should
get out of here.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.429
What happened?

03:15.463 --> 03:17.265
I saved that
little girl's life.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.266
What's he saying?

03:18.266 --> 03:18.932
Uh, "thanks"?

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:11.585 --> 04:13.487
We did it
when I was a kid.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.324
No way. Gifts get opened
on Christmas morning.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.858
( chatter )

04:18.892 --> 04:20.761
I did it
when I was a kid.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.464
No way.
Gifts get opened
on Christmas morning.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.765
Tell Dr. Lewis
we'll be back

04:24.798 --> 04:25.733
for more as soon
as we can.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.335
Where are you taking them?

04:27.335 --> 04:28.502
Harold Washington Library
on State Street.

04:28.536 --> 04:29.970
The library?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.605
They keep opening up
public buildings

04:31.639 --> 04:32.673
until everybody's in.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.675
If Alex opens
a gift tonight...

04:34.708 --> 04:37.345
No, it's cheating
if you open a gift
the night before.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.813
Then he won't be
so desperate to get up,

04:39.847 --> 04:40.981
which means
he'll sleep in,

04:41.014 --> 04:42.783
which means
we get to sleep in.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.917
Oh, okay.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.753
Plus it's just fun.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.921
Is that a trick
so you can open
your gift tonight?

04:47.955 --> 04:48.922
( chuckles )

04:48.956 --> 04:50.090
Robert Sanders, 42.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.892
Syncopal episode at home.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.561
Hit his head on a chair
on the way down.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.663
Mr. Sanders,
I'm Dr. Kovac.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.864
190/100.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.065
110 and 130.
Glucose 125.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.367
I can't get a sat.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.634
It's too cold to read.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.869
You guys
need some help?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.037
So it seems.
Increased work breathing,

05:04.071 --> 05:05.406
crackles bilaterally.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.574
Wife's a few minutes
behind us.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.875
Gonna be below ten degrees
tonight.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.842
Merry Christmas.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.110
Excuse us, please.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.780
You have to keep
this pathway clear.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.382
Medical history?
Read it and weep.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.584
Get out of the way now.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.552
Okay. "Systemic lupus
erythematosis."

05:18.586 --> 05:19.953
Diagnosed 20 years ago.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.855
"Dialysis-dependent
renal failure."

05:21.889 --> 05:23.424
I dialyzed yesterday,
two hours.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.592
"Coronary artery
disease."

05:24.625 --> 05:26.660
Yeah, come on.
Okay, let's go.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.095
"Hypertension,
Hepatitis "C."

05:28.128 --> 05:30.030
And a partridge
in a pear tree.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.064
Sorry.
I'm a handful.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.600
Hey, Morris, stop eating.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.734
We got a hundred people
in the waiting area.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.503
Louis already
loaded me up.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.838
Pratt, is your CVA
out of trauma one?

05:37.871 --> 05:39.006
ICU just called
for him.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.007
Sats correlating at 89.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.409
Okay. Crank up the O2.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.743
Abby, I have six charts
for you.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.612
I haven't even
taken my coat off yet.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.915
Oh, Carter, stay
on with DHS.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.817
You have to pound them
to pick up the homeless.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.118
Right.
Squeaky wheel.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.953
Yeah, it'll calm down
soon enough.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.655
If they're not in by midnight,
they'll be frozen.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.590
Susan, you guys going
to be around tomorrow?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.726
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm on at 3:00,
but we'll be hanging till then.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.428
You should bring Henry by.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.063
Oh, I will. I got something
for Cosmo and I want

06:03.096 --> 06:04.632
you to see Henry
in his Santa suit.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.566
You got a headache?

06:05.599 --> 06:06.900
No, I got a backache.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.436
I was helping a friend
move a couch.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.837
Who else is on with me?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.005
Uh, Chen, but she's
running a little late.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.774
It's becoming a habit.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.875
Merry Christmas.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.444
Oh, my God.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.911
Did you just re-gift this
right in front of me?

06:17.945 --> 06:21.148
Yep. I'm your
Secret Santa. Enjoy.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.619
He's an established
rheumatology patient,

06:25.653 --> 06:26.887
followed by Dr. Scheer.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.122
Spear, not Scheer.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.459
I'm the wife--
Carol Shoup-Sanders.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.693
It's Jared Spear.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.127
Sorry, that's Spear--
Dr. Spear.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.128
Can you touch
your chin to
your chest?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.597
I have a complete file

06:36.630 --> 06:37.731
of Robert's medical
history right here.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.866
Yeah, and his pulse ox
is borderline.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.634
We can order
his records.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.102
Believe me,
you'll prefer mine,
more concise.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.671
Honey, let them work.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.639
Tilt your head
all the way back.

06:45.673 --> 06:46.707
You need my help.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.576
You just don't
know it yet.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.710
Uh, no, he needs
to be admitted.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.479
Let's sit him up.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.481
We're gonna make you
more comfortable,
Mr. Sanders.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.682
Robert.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.683
Okay, how long
was he unconscious?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.184
47 seconds.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.720
What happened
before that?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.089
I stood up from
the dinner table...

07:02.122 --> 07:03.824
He felt short of breath
and dizzy.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.758
Any chest pain?

07:04.792 --> 07:05.659
No.
No.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.927
Rheum's not coming in.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.496
Dr. Spear?
He was
unavailable.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.698
They said the primary complaint
sounded cardiac

07:10.731 --> 07:13.501
so we have to give him
nitrates and call Cardiology.

07:13.501 --> 07:17.170
We have a great cardiologist,
Dr. Knauth. K-N-A-U-T-H.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.575
Shouldn't somebody
be writing this down?

07:21.609 --> 07:24.512
Another shelter van's here.
Let's go.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.846
I'll take the first 20 people.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.247
62-year-old male.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.082
Lives under a bridge
says he's having chest pain.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.718
Get him registered
and check a 12 lead
pulse ox

07:30.751 --> 07:32.052
and take a
chest film.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.523
Diagnosis: hunger, cold
aftercare, food, warmth.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.057
Hey, Jake Scanlon,
fourth year.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.527
Transferred from Creighton.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.795
Hey, Jake.
This guy knows
if he says "chest pain"

07:41.829 --> 07:43.130
he'll be here
for 16 hours

07:43.163 --> 07:44.264
and he'll get
a tray of food.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.265
So let me do
you a favor.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.634
Listen up, everyone.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.536
The vans are here
to take you all

07:48.569 --> 07:49.670
to the Holiday Inn.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.104
That is right.
Thank the Mayor.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.173
There'll be plenty of food,
and remember,

07:53.206 --> 07:54.808
it's all good
at the Holiday Inn.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.610
Liar.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.145
It's working.
Only the sick ones
are staying

07:58.178 --> 07:59.279
Don't give him
any credit.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.948
Very good.
Trick the needy.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.783
What? It's a holiday,
and they're going

08:02.816 --> 08:04.251
someplace that's
like an inn.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.686
All right, man,
get in the van.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.954
You about ready?
We got to pick up

08:06.987 --> 08:08.856
Alex in about
20 minutes.
Yeah.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.691
Hey, Abby,
is that a cardiology
on Mr. Sanders?

08:10.724 --> 08:11.925
Yeah. I'm on hold.
But you guys go.

08:11.959 --> 08:12.893
I'll present
to Carter or Chen.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.961
Thanks, Abby.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.862
Sure?

08:14.895 --> 08:15.863
Well, you've been on

08:15.896 --> 08:16.897
since 7:00 this morning.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.566
Somebody should have
Christmas.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.033
Yeah, Alex is pretty excited.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.735
Alex or you?

08:21.769 --> 08:23.637
Go ahead.
We're fine.
We're fine.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.072
Thanks.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.775
Hi, I'm calling
about patient Robert Sanders.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.909
Abby, is Kovac
still here?

08:28.942 --> 08:30.210
Admit.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.712
Yeah, cardiomegaly
and pulmonary edema.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.847
Luka.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.683
Hey, I have a lupus
patient for you

08:35.716 --> 08:36.650
in trauma one.
Sanders.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.217
No, no, I can't stay.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.721
I'm just here
to pick up meds
for my dad.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.823
Look, I know
it's a lot to ask,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.825
but can you cover
my shift?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.661
It's Christmas Eve.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.163
I know. I'll do New Years.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.065
Ready, Freddy?

08:54.602 --> 08:56.303
I'm sorry.
I can't cover for you.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.337
It's a family emergency.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.639
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.775
Are you serious?
For tonight?

09:01.809 --> 09:02.776
Come on.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.612
It's my first

09:04.612 --> 09:06.013
Christmas with Sam and Alex.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.949
I can't help you this time.
I'm sorry.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.987
Dr. Chen, this is Margaret.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.757
She'll be temp
clerking this evening.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.258
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.360
Not a big fan
of the yuletide.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.829
Oh, is Lewis still here?

09:21.862 --> 09:23.631
Headed towards
the exit as am I.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.665
Merry Christmas.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.899
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.935
What does that mean
exactly?

09:27.968 --> 09:31.271
What, Merry Christmas?

09:31.304 --> 09:35.075
You could at least examine him
before you blow me o...

09:35.108 --> 09:37.044
Okay, BNP, fine.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.046
Happy Holidays to you, too.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.080
Never get sick on Christmas.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.015
Hey, did you call Psych?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.817
Yes. I suggested
they bring Kibble.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.318
Okay. And you
can go home.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.654
Med students don't
have to work holidays.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.188
I volunteered.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.389
That's twisted.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.191
Next year I'm inventing
a family

09:51.224 --> 09:52.860
so I don't have
to work on Christmas.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.861
( chuckles )

09:53.894 --> 09:56.329
What did Dr. Knauth say?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.666
Cardiology thinks
it's a kidney problem.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.001
How's the breathing,
Mr. Sanders?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.637
Hanging... in there.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.338
Dr. MacPherson's
our kidney guy.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.841
Right, he's on call tonight.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.710
I thought I told
you to go home?

10:09.743 --> 10:14.748
BP 195/105, heart rate 115,
resps 30, sats 93.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.384
CBC, troponin, chem seven
and Cards suggested BNP...

10:17.417 --> 10:19.052
What the hell is that?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.254
B-type
natriuretic peptide.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.790
I will double-check
the dosage on that.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.157
Can you get me started
on the other stuff

10:24.191 --> 10:25.292
and get me a suture kit
for the head lac.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.393
You got it.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.260
What'd you say your name was?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.962
Jake.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.067
Jing-Mei, I am sorry
about your dad,
I really am,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.769
but I've been cutting
you breaks for weeks.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.037
I know and
I appreciate it.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.238
This'll be
the last time.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.207
Oh, man. There is no way
I can get anyone

10:40.240 --> 10:41.842
to cover tonight.
It's impossible.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.678
Susan, please.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.680
I hate to be hardcore,
but I can't.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.748
Can you stay?

10:47.781 --> 10:48.982
I have a baby

10:49.016 --> 10:52.052
and a guy who's been
watching him 24/7.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.454
And I just worked
a 14-hour shift.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.156
No, I can't.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.458
Maybe Carter can handle it,
He's got Abby and Morris.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.993
We are inundated
with homeless

11:00.027 --> 11:01.261
from the city roundup.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.462
I know.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.431
We're already
understaffed.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.968
Jing-Mei, please,
you have to understand.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.302
I do. It's okay.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.239
Good. Thank you.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.275
I'm sorry, Susan.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.977
I quit.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.187
* ...Merry Christmas
and a happy new year... *
And so the holiday begins.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.189
Happy, happy,
joy, joy, everyone.
* ...to you and your kin

11:29.222 --> 11:31.191
* Good tidings
for Christmas... *

11:31.224 --> 11:32.993
Nine-year-old auto versus ped.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.995
Thrown ten feet to the pavement,
transient LOC, hit and run.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.363
Mom?
Right here,
honey.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.865
Confused and agitated.

11:37.898 --> 11:38.932
What's his name?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.000
Harry.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.802
Hey, Harry,
I'm Dr. Carter.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.336
We're going to take good care
of you., all right? Hey, Ray.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.838
I'll get Neela.
My shift's over.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.473
Neela's backed up.
I got a plane to catch.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.407
I'm not asking!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.942
One, two, three.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.344
Large bore IV
and 500 of saline wide open.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.445
What happened?
Car hit him.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.181
Came out of nowhere.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.382
He's got a weak
femoral-- was
he thrown?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.084
Diffuse ecchymosis
on the chest.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.118
He was outside.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.386
I parked the car
and Harry was

11:59.419 --> 12:00.420
getting out
when we got hit.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.421
Harry flew up in the air.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.956
Mattie!
Systolic's 77.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.224
You guys are okay,
though, right?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.192
You're not hurt?
We're okay.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.860
Paramedics checked us.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.796
Tenderness and crepitus over
the chest wall bilaterally.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.263
What's that mean?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.464
That means he
has multiple
rib fractures.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.000
Mom, it hurts.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.401
Baby, I'm here.
Okay, CBC.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.269
Type and cross
for four,

12:16.303 --> 12:17.938
head, chest
and belly CT,

12:17.971 --> 12:19.539
trauma panel and
a femoral line.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.908
Pulse is up to 138.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.209
Okay, rush the blood bank.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.811
He could be anxious
or bleeding out.

12:23.811 --> 12:24.878
Bleeding out?

12:24.912 --> 12:27.047
It's okay, Mattie.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.982
We'll take care
of your brother, okay?

12:29.016 --> 12:31.418
Why don't we take Mattie
for a little walk?
I want to stay here.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.519
Can I stay here?
I'll set her up

12:32.552 --> 12:33.887
in the family room.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.523
Come on, Mattie.
Let's go, hon.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.161
Dr. MacPherson, this is Lockhart
again in the E.R.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.830
I'm calling
about Robert Sanders.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.431
I know his wife can
be a pain in the ass,

12:44.464 --> 12:45.933
but tonight I think
he has a real...

12:45.966 --> 12:49.469
problem, and he, uh,
he needs dialysis

12:49.502 --> 12:51.138
and call me back.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.274
Abby, take this
thyromegally and be well.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.309
As you can see, I have
a par-tay to attend.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.477
Where you going?

12:57.510 --> 12:59.279
Well, not that you
would know about it,

12:59.312 --> 13:00.948
but I'm going to
the Player's Ball
at the Peninsula.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.382
Kanye West is performing,

13:02.415 --> 13:04.117
Twister, the whole
Rockefeller...

13:04.151 --> 13:05.452
Hello.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.553
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for a doctor.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.554
Well, that
would be me.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.889
How can I help you?

13:08.922 --> 13:11.291
I'm looking
for Dr. Morris.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.160
Morris. No, see,
what you need is...

13:13.193 --> 13:14.427
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, hey!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.996
...somebody who
has experience and...

13:16.029 --> 13:17.965
Hi, hi, glad you
could make it.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.432
Come on, I'll
show you around.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.600
Bye.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.969
Bye.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.303
She's with Morris?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.272
Chen just quit.
Where's Carter?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.439
Quit what?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.075
The hospital.
Where's Carter?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.609
I think he's
in Trauma Two.
Quit for good?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.544
Who?
Is she all right?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.446
Oh, I don't know.
She's burned out,
and we're screwed.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.581
I can't believe it.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.582
Chen.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.451
Your, uh,
Secret Santa gift.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.453
From you?
No. Found it
in the doctors' lounge

13:40.487 --> 13:42.122
with your name on it.
What's up with Chen?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.991
I don't know, she's
not answering.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.458
Rats, Lice and History?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.260
Ooh, that's
a good one.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.129
Someone really likes you.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.364
I got a Pez dispenser.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.332
Hey, I'll see
y'all later.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.466
Happy Christmas.
Bye.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.102
Hey, I got
a 39-year-old IDU.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.336
Narcotic withdrawal.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.338
I'm dying.
This guy
needs detox.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.140
Exam Two.
Point one of clonidine.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.909
Hey, what are you doing?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.610
This is a publicly
funded hospital,

14:03.643 --> 14:05.913
and this is a, an illegal
religious artifact.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.947
Well, it's Christmas.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.115
So?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.282
So...

14:11.284 --> 14:12.552
Put it back.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.055
Sharps back.
Pericardiocentesis needle.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.489
Systolic's 82
on one liter.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.191
Carter,
Chen just quit.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.660
Harry, you're going to feel
a little pressure.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.295
She quit?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.931
RAY:
Heart rate's
trending up.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.599
Yeah, that's the tamponade
limiting contractions.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.168
You got to up the rate
to compensate.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.502
What's that mean?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.971
Uh, there's blood
around his heart.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.039
Dr. Carter
will relieve it.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.473
PVC's.
Yeah, I know.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.574
I'm in, but I'm not
getting anything.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.043
Lift up his head
a little bit.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.244
Chuny, close
to trauma and refuse

14:37.277 --> 14:38.979
to board
any more homeless.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.513
Good idea-- did
you get a whiff
of triage?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.049
How can people
stink so much

14:42.082 --> 14:43.516
in cold weather?
Oil of wintergreen
on a mask,

14:43.550 --> 14:44.551
or breathe through your mouth.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.287
You're not staying?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.525
There's blood's in there,
but it's either clotted

14:52.559 --> 14:54.027
or it's collecting
posteriorly.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.262
I can't get it
with a needle.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.563
Page CT Surge.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.065
Oh, I'll get Neela.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.699
If I leave now,
I can still make my plane.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.700
You can forget about your plane.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.235
I promised my mother.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.236
Your mother?

15:04.537 --> 15:05.538
Look, somebody's got to stay.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.074
I'll page Surgery.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.641
Ask for an
echo-guided

15:08.675 --> 15:10.110
pericardial window.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.280
Hey, Carter,
do you have a minute?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.481
Yeah.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.516
Titrate the dopamine
to a systolic of 90.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.584
Keep paging CT Surge.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.120
All right, Harry's stable,

15:20.153 --> 15:21.621
and Dr. Barnett
is here.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.192
Apparently.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.595
My lupus patient--

15:28.628 --> 15:30.597
pulmonary edema's worse,
and his pressure sucks.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.565
Can you take a look?
Sure.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.600
So, Chen quit?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.102
What was it, her dad?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.669
Yeah. I'll go home,
have dinner with Chuck

15:36.703 --> 15:38.405
and Cosmo, sing a couple
of carols, come back.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.207
Chuck's been cooking
a turkey all day.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.708
My dad's there...
All right, all
right, go home.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.710
If we get busy, I'll
call you, otherwise,
stay home.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.013
Thank you, thank you.
You're amazing. Thank you.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.047
Come be amazing over here.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.248
I'll check in later.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.749
Did you, uh, call
his primaries?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.751
Rheum says he's too sick
for them, call Cardiology.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.586
Cards says it's not
his heart, call Renal.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.288
Renal says he's
just had dialysis,

15:55.322 --> 15:56.289
it's not their problem.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.593
BP's dropping, 88/59.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.562
Stop that BNP drip
and lower his head.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.031
Yeah, I tried that--
he desats.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.599
Hard to breathe.
Carol?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.701
She's going to
come right back.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.471
Abby, you give
nitro paste and BNP drip?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.341
Give two vasodilators,
and his pressure'll bottom out.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.742
Well, you try getting
three specialists

16:15.775 --> 16:17.044
on the phone
on Christmas Eve.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.146
You're his doctor.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.781
Ah, he's got crackles
in the apices.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.616
You have Renal coming in
to take off the fluid?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.617
No.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.553
What do you mean, no?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.421
He was dialyzed yesterday,
so Renal thinks

16:28.455 --> 16:30.323
there's another explanation
for the edema.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.059
What do you think it is?

16:32.059 --> 16:34.561
I think he got
half his usual
dialysis time

16:34.594 --> 16:36.063
because they
were jammed

16:36.063 --> 16:37.330
for the holidays,
ate a salty dinner

16:37.364 --> 16:39.399
and flooded
his lungs.
So...?

16:39.432 --> 16:40.700
So I'm waiting to hear

16:40.733 --> 16:42.669
from MacPherson,
the Renal attending.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.172
Dr. Agbo
from Surgery's here.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.640
Agbo? I've never
heard of him.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.476
You know, junior fellow,
sweaty palms.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.178
Nobody wants to
be here tonight.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.312
Including me.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.513
Okay, why don't you call

16:53.546 --> 16:55.082
Dr. Renal Mac
Whatshisname again,

16:55.082 --> 16:56.483
and remember
that nobody knows

16:56.516 --> 16:58.685
what your patient needs
right now better than you do.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.819
Sats only 88.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.654
Uh, put him on a non-rebreather.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.256
That should help.
I'll be right back.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.391
Okay?

17:06.693 --> 17:09.695
These are Robert's
medical records.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.199
Listen, um, about
today on the phone...

17:12.232 --> 17:13.566
Pain-in-the-ass
that I am,

17:13.599 --> 17:15.202
I walked them down
from Records myself.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.769
Otherwise, you would've
received them tomorrow.

17:16.803 --> 17:20.173
Now, will you look
at my file?

17:35.722 --> 17:36.823
Hey.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.425
What are you doing here?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.393
Heard a crazy story
about you quitting.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.694
Can I come in?

17:41.728 --> 17:45.265
Uh, you know, thanks,
Greg, but I'm fine.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.299
Thanks for coming by.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.268
( man speaking Chinese )

17:50.670 --> 17:52.605
( Chen speaking Chinese )

17:55.342 --> 17:57.644
Hey, you need
some help?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.779
Yeah, give me some
Ativan, please.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.181
How much?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.315
Two milligrams.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.151
Papa.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.220
What happened at work today?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.656
Sometimes he's
cooperative and lucid.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.658
Sometimes he's like this.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.860
Sundowning.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.495
Sundowning?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.164
It's too nice
a word for it.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.768
( Chen speaking Chinese )

18:23.370 --> 18:25.672
Give me my pants, please.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.174
PRATT:
You know you got

18:27.174 --> 18:28.675
a lot of Ativan here.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.310
Potassium, too.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.350
Jing-mei, what are you doing?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.286
Talk to me! What's going on?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.823
MOTHER:
What's he doing?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.392
He's going to try
and relieve

18:45.425 --> 18:46.526
the blood accumulating
around the heart.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.860
Is that the pericardium?
Yep.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.562
Ten blade and
pickups to me.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.863
Watch over my boy.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.532
Let's give them a little
more room to work.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.203
McAlpin catheter and a
60cc syringe, quickly.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.370
Whoa, a hundred
ccs right there.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.606
Keep him safe, Lord, I beg you.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.707
Another 60cc
syringe, quickly.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.541
Hey, man.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.542
Uh, Dr. Agbo?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.311
Maybe I nicked a vessel.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.213
CARTER:
All right, give me
some sterile eights.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.214
BARNETT:
PVCs...

19:07.214 --> 19:08.381
Bigeminy.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.249
Pull the catheter back.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.850
AGBO:
I can get it.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.619
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.620
( shrieking ):
Shut up, Mattie!

19:13.653 --> 19:14.354
Hey!

19:14.387 --> 19:15.622
Mrs. Price,

19:15.655 --> 19:16.723
take your daughter
outside right now.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.258
No, no, I want
to stay with my son.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.726
I said pull that
catheter back.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.394
AGBO:
The blood will
just reaccumulate...

19:21.428 --> 19:22.962
Get out of the way,
get out of the way.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.431
V-tach! Crash cart.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.567
CARTER:
Catheter is out.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.802
Charged to 100. Clear.
Just wait, just wait.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.405
Normal sinus.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.307
All right, 3-O on
a needle driver.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.509
That's good, right?

19:36.543 --> 19:37.610
That's good?

19:37.644 --> 19:38.811
Dr. Carter...

19:38.845 --> 19:40.347
Neela, can you take
this little girl

19:40.380 --> 19:41.548
to the family room,
page Social Services

19:41.581 --> 19:42.682
and then stay
with her

19:42.715 --> 19:44.617
until they
get here.
No.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.590
( sobbing )

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
( sniffles )

19:57.630 --> 19:59.732
Feeling better?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.735
A little.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.937
Don't lie, Robert.
He's not better.
Look at him.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.573
BP's stabilized.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.974
119/85.
Pulse down to 115.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.609
He's had lupus
cerebritis?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.311
Two years ago.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.012
It calmed down
after a steroid burst.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.581
Okay, I'd like to
get a head scan

20:14.614 --> 20:16.416
to make sure the
cerebritis isn't back

20:16.449 --> 20:17.684
and that there's no
internal bleeding

20:17.717 --> 20:19.452
from the fall--
I have a discharge,

20:19.486 --> 20:21.654
and then I'll
take you.
I can take him.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.792
Do you know where it is?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.627
Mm-hmm. Can his wife come
with us?

20:27.660 --> 20:28.961
Sure.
Thanks.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.630
Put him on a portable
monitor and O2

20:30.663 --> 20:32.699
and call me if you
have questions.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.566
Okay?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.702
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.307
RASGOTRA:
Would you
like to color?

20:41.808 --> 20:45.345
You excited
about Santa coming tonight?

20:46.446 --> 20:48.348
Why not?

20:48.381 --> 20:50.717
Santa's not coming for me.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.320
Mattie, that's not true.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.589
Hey.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.591
I thought you had a plane
to catch.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.798
Hey, Mattie,
how you doing?

21:07.534 --> 21:09.502
You know,
when I was a kid,

21:09.536 --> 21:11.571
I used to fight with my brother
all the time.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.406
Did he get hurt?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.676
Yeah, he got hurt. I got hurt.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.445
Kids get hurt sometimes

21:18.478 --> 21:19.646
by accident.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.014
I was mad at him
for not playing with me,

21:22.048 --> 21:26.619
so I threw his book out, and
he went to get it and got hit.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.755
Mattie, it's not your fault
that Harry got hurt.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.691
It is. I tried to help him,
but I couldn't.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.660
I had to go get my mom.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.495
Your mom wasn't there?

21:35.528 --> 21:38.064
She was at work.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.700
You and Harry were alone
in the car?

21:40.733 --> 21:43.370
We live in the car.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.408
Don't tell my mom.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.710
I'm not supposed to say that.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.481
My father's a doctor.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.749
He knows
what he's asking.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.586
( sighs ):
Without the G-tube and IV,
he would've died weeks ago.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.621
Oh, so now life-saving
technology is bad?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.590
If someone doesn't want it.

22:03.623 --> 22:04.757
How do you know he
doesn't want it?

22:04.791 --> 22:05.892
He's not even in
his right mind.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.561
After he sleeps, he's lucid.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.764
Each time, every day,
he begs me to help him.

22:11.798 --> 22:15.535
Removing the support's
not enough.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.437
I-It would take him days
to die of dehydration,

22:17.470 --> 22:20.573
and he'd be in misery.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.074
Put him in a
nursing home.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.910
What, so he could be
somebody else's problem,

22:23.943 --> 22:25.678
someone who doesn't know him
or love him?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.580
He won't even know
that he's there.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.750
( sighs )

22:30.783 --> 22:32.619
You're not Chinese.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.755
Oh, so it's Chinese

22:35.788 --> 22:37.490
to euthanize
your elders?

22:37.524 --> 22:40.427
It's Chinese to respect them.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.575
There you go.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.577
You should go.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.111
I don't want you here.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.147
You've been through a hell
of a lot this last year.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.015
You need a break.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.118
Put him in a home for a month
so you can catch your breath.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.687
I can't.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.824
We fight to save
lives every day.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.860
You know, we literally
bust our asses

23:13.893 --> 23:16.496
to give people a few
more hours of living.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.130
You're a doctor.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.999
You can't just cross that
line like it's nothing.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.636
Quality of life is the only
measure that matters.

23:23.670 --> 23:26.906
My proud father is lying
in his own feces,

23:26.939 --> 23:31.077
he can't eat without
vomiting, can't sleep.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.580
He knows what he's asking for

23:33.613 --> 23:35.682
and he knows he can
get that from me.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.850
If you weren't a physician,
you couldn't do this.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.753
But I am, and I can.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.189
Why haven't you
done it up till now?

23:44.891 --> 23:48.661
If he's been asking
so much?

23:48.695 --> 23:50.763
Because you know deep
down inside,

23:50.797 --> 23:54.734
it would haunt you for
the rest of your life.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.503
Why haven't you done it yet?

23:59.639 --> 24:02.609
Maybe I don't have the courage.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.212
It's over.
Christ is born.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.714
It's only midnight?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.148
Feels like 4:00
in the morning.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.851
Margaret, if you turn off
these lights one more time,

24:11.884 --> 24:13.520
I'm going to beat you
to death with a fruitcake.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.254
This is totally
Loser's Christmas.

24:15.287 --> 24:19.692
Give that back
you little minx...

24:19.726 --> 24:22.529
Okay, Rudolfo, can you blow

24:22.562 --> 24:25.031
like you're blowing out
candles on a birthday cake?

24:25.064 --> 24:26.165
Too many cold.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.100
Does it hurt
to breathe in?

24:28.134 --> 24:31.170
MARGARET:
Lockhart, your lupus patient's
coding in the scanner.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.939
All right. Uh, Neela,
chest film and O2.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.607
Got it.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.008
Hey.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.611
Hey. It was cool what you
did with that little girl,

24:38.645 --> 24:39.912
telling her about
your brother.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.581
Yeah, I think it helped...

24:41.614 --> 24:43.883
although I don't actually
have any siblings.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.552
Why does that
not surprise me?

24:45.585 --> 24:46.819
So Social Work's
got Mattie.

24:46.853 --> 24:47.954
Carter says I can go.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.188
Can I sign out
Harry to you?

24:49.221 --> 24:50.857
I thought you already
missed your flight.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.158
I'll go standby.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.760
Don't want to disappoint
Mom on Christmas.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.729
CAROL:
Do something!

24:56.763 --> 24:58.264
CT TECH:
BP's 83 over 50.
Cycle the dynamap.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.566
What happened?

24:59.599 --> 25:00.800
Central line got caught

25:00.833 --> 25:02.201
when we moved him
and it pulled out.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.736
Bleeding won't stop.

25:03.770 --> 25:04.737
Not with lupus-associated
coagulopathy.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.005
Heart rate's dropping.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.840
ABBY:
Okay. 8-O and a Mac two. Now.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.610
Ma'am, please step back and
let us help your husband.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.078
Put pressure right here.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.079
Don't check it,
don't let go.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.581
Sats 68.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.649
Yeah, he's hypoxic, I get it,
thanks.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.184
Oh, God. Please don't
let it be tonight.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.986
I'm sorry.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.220
Tube.
( alarms )

25:21.253 --> 25:22.922
Pulse 64.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.692
I'm not ready for him to die.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.593
I'm in.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.662
Sats coming up.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.930
Run, don't walk,
to the blood bank,

25:30.963 --> 25:32.164
get four units of oh-neg,

25:32.198 --> 25:33.933
have them start working
on type specific.

25:33.966 --> 25:34.834
I'll meet you
in the trauma room.

25:34.867 --> 25:35.768
He's stable?

25:35.802 --> 25:37.169
He needs blood and fluids.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.905
We're gonna have
to start another central line.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.339
Can we get an attending
to do it?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.941
I put in lines all the time.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.109
He's been put through enough.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.644
I want a surgical attending.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.348
He's moving
in the right direction.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.651
He's gonna spend
the night in here tonight

25:51.684 --> 25:52.985
until an ICU bed opens up.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.787
You were at work
when this happened?

25:54.821 --> 25:57.890
We've been living in the car

25:57.924 --> 26:00.893
since I left my husband
three weeks ago.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.362
It wasn't bad
when the kids were

26:03.395 --> 26:08.034
in school, but since
Christmas vacation started...

26:08.067 --> 26:09.936
You left them in the car?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.638
I got to work.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.106
It's okay, Mama.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.646
Can their dad help?

26:19.679 --> 26:21.648
He's a violent guy.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.751
I could take it,
but he was starting

26:24.784 --> 26:27.754
in on Harry,
so, I...

26:27.787 --> 26:29.121
CARTER:
Yeah, we're a little

26:29.155 --> 26:30.723
concerned
about the amount of strain

26:30.757 --> 26:31.758
that you've been under.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.195
I didn't want Mattie
saying how it was

26:36.228 --> 26:39.398
'cause I don't want
anyone taking my kids.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.968
We're not
homeless people.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.369
I got a job.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.871
This is just
temporary.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.305
I can help you
find a place

26:46.338 --> 26:48.240
to stay until you get
on your feet.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.909
We tried the shelter.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.410
It isn't safe
for the kids.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.212
No, this isn't a shelter.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.948
It's a house for families
fleeing domestic violence.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.186
It's safe.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.121
( crying ):
Thank you.

27:05.692 --> 27:08.394
I'm sorry that I
yelled at you, honey.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.964
Don't be scared of me, okay?

27:11.998 --> 27:13.933
I'm sorry, Ma.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.435
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.705
( crying ):
Come here.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.711
( crying )

27:28.848 --> 27:30.316
So, what do you think?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.051
I think the bad guy's
the hit and run driver,

27:32.084 --> 27:33.185
not the mother,

27:33.219 --> 27:34.887
and this lady
needs a break.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.155
Cafeteria's serving up
a holiday feast.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.457
Better get up there.
Hey, Morris...

27:38.490 --> 27:39.992
Ooh.
( Raphaella giggling )

27:40.026 --> 27:41.260
Burgers probably would have
been safer.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.361
Oh.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.395
Speaking of
which, though,

27:43.429 --> 27:44.831
I'm a little hungry.

27:44.864 --> 27:45.932
You want to get
something to eat?

27:45.965 --> 27:46.933
Just lost my appetite.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.100
Dr. Carter,

27:48.134 --> 27:50.102
phone call from Africa.
Kim somebody.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.103
Catch you later.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.206
Hello.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.775
Hi.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.310
Um, I'm not doing anything.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.079
I'm just working.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.049
No, it's too cold to snow here.
Maybe tomorrow.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.317
( Mr. Chen groaning )

28:13.525 --> 28:14.961
( sighs )

28:14.994 --> 28:16.128
Shh.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.296
It's okay.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.765
Huh?

28:18.798 --> 28:19.932
Huh?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.100
It's okay.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.268
( speaking Chinese )

28:22.301 --> 28:24.236
No, no, it's okay. No.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.805
Calm down.
No, don't worry.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.039
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.107
( speaking Chinese )

28:28.140 --> 28:29.108
No, no, no, no.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.509
Four of Ativan?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.478
I add five of Haldol
when he's like this.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.180
( grunts )

28:34.213 --> 28:36.082
( speaking Chinese, weeping )
Okay, calm down.

28:36.115 --> 28:39.085
( speaking excitedly
in Chinese )

28:39.118 --> 28:40.186
What is he saying?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.154
To let him go.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.456
( crying )

28:44.490 --> 28:45.958
( speaking Chinese )

28:45.992 --> 28:48.294
Shh, shh.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.528
( speaking Chinese )

28:49.561 --> 28:51.798
I'm sorry.

28:51.798 --> 28:52.965
( Mr. Chen crying )

28:52.999 --> 28:54.801
JING-MEI:
I'm sorry, Papa.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.035
( both crying )

28:56.068 --> 28:57.503
MORRIS:
Okay. Now, squeeze.
Hmm.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.205
Hold on.
RAPHAELLA:
Uh. No wait.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.940
MORRIS:
Hold on.
Both hands, both hands.

29:00.973 --> 29:01.908
MORRIS:
Let go of my hand.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.175
( Raphaella giggling )

29:03.209 --> 29:04.176
MORRIS:
Let go...
( both laugh )

29:04.210 --> 29:05.544
And squeeze the trigger.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.946
( giggling ):
My hands are shaking.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.014
MORRIS:
Hey!

29:08.047 --> 29:09.015
RASGOTRA:
Hi.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.182
Hi.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.219
Um, Neela,
Raphaella Greenberg.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.121
Are you a medical student?

29:15.154 --> 29:17.990
Um, I-I'm his girlfriend.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.025
HIPPA?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.827
Patient privacy?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.028
Stapling is nothing.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.162
This guy's totally out of it.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.430
This is so wrong.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.032
( sighs )

29:26.065 --> 29:28.100
I'll staple,
you watch.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.135
Hmm.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.037
MALIK:
Security!
Security!

29:31.070 --> 29:33.005
Somebody get
Security!

29:33.039 --> 29:34.974
MARGARET:
Give me a reason.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.375
Give me a reason,
you, give...

29:36.408 --> 29:38.144
Whoa, whoa, stop it, stop it.
Whose patient is this?

29:38.177 --> 29:39.378
RAGGOTRA:
Mine. Hi, Mr.
Beidermeier.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.947
BEIDERMEIER:
I need help.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.849
All right, get Security
to cuff him to a bed, huh?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.217
And get him on a monitor until
we can figure out what he took.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.218
Okay.
Should have let him OD.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.887
Come on,
up, up.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.988
That's the
Christmas spirit.
Yeah.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.089
Back to bed,
Mr. Beidermeier.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.091
At least have him arrested.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.092
What's your
name again?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.260
Margaret.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.895
Margaret, we're
good here.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.864
( breathing heavily )

29:57.864 --> 29:59.431
Crap!

29:59.465 --> 30:00.867
LOCKHART:
Got a flash.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.968
Guidewire.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.269
Didn't you come in

30:03.302 --> 30:04.536
because the wife
wants you to do this?

30:04.570 --> 30:06.172
Not her call.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.207
I like to make a small nick
with an 11 blade.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.376
She's afraid
Abby might kill her husband.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.178
I don't think she will.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.345
( sighs )

30:13.379 --> 30:14.847
Okay. Catheter.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.250
Tachy at 110,
B.P. 94/79,

30:18.284 --> 30:19.185
sats 86.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.853
Yeah, and that's

30:20.887 --> 30:23.089
as good as he's gonna get
until he's dialyzed.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.124
His lungs are
swimming in fluid.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.192
DUBENKO:
Nice.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.259
Threading
easily. Good.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.627
Thank you
for coming in.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.196
It's my job.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.498
Yeah. Well, you want
to admit him to your service?

30:32.531 --> 30:34.233
All his other docs
are blowing me off.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.634
Ah, Santa Claus
is coming to town.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.204
Okay, removing the introducer,
10cc syringe.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.406
You know, legally and morally,
they have to come when you call,

30:40.439 --> 30:41.440
or they can lose
staff privileges.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.975
Oh, really. I don't think

30:43.009 --> 30:44.543
they've heard the news
about all my power.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.245
Oh, they're aware,
they're aware, all right.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.014
They like to take advantage
of submissive interns.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.115
I'm not submissive.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.582
Nice return.
I know.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.119
DUBENKO:
Like many interns, and,

30:53.152 --> 30:55.287
well, many
females, you
incline yourself

30:55.321 --> 30:57.990
toward popularity
and equate it
with success.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.591
Well, when an ER
doc is popular,

30:59.625 --> 31:00.960
someone's
losing out,

31:00.993 --> 31:02.661
and it's usually
the patient.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.931
All this guy has is you.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.098
Infusing well.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.299
Needle driver.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.634
All right, well, good job.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.202
Really good job, Abby.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.971
I'll-I'll finish up.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.305
Yeah, go.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.241
Go out there
and do what you have to do.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.378
And by the by, did you,
um, get the book?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.150
Rats, Lice and History?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.486
You're my Secret Santa?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.355
Yeah, I'm quite excited
to discuss it with you.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.690
The chapter on the influence
of louse and vermin epidemics

31:31.723 --> 31:33.292
on political
and military history

31:33.325 --> 31:35.594
and the relative
unimportance

31:35.627 --> 31:37.997
of generals is outrageous.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.201
Uh, 4-oh silk.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.440
Submissive.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.077
Not a word I would
use to describe you.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.711
Okay.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.014
Time to get unpopular.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.183
Look, uh, I take
full responsibility

31:57.216 --> 31:59.251
for what happened
with Sanders.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.220
You didn't do it, the Tech did.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.222
And I should not have sent
a student to CT.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.291
I want you to
send me, okay?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.059
It won't happen again.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.095
So, what'd you learn
from all this?

32:09.128 --> 32:12.031
Always go home
when you tell me.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.235
Hi, is this the dialysis tech?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.237
Yeah, I know it's 2:00 a.m.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.705
I'm sorry to wake you.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.707
MR. CHEN:
Jing-Mei...

32:21.740 --> 32:24.143
( speaking Chinese )

32:39.125 --> 32:41.360
Mm.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.329
( continues speaking
Chinese )

32:50.036 --> 32:52.038
Hmm?

33:06.252 --> 33:08.087
( soft groaning )

33:11.157 --> 33:12.558
What did he say?

33:14.760 --> 33:18.064
He thanked me.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.066
Said I was a good daughter.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.205
You are.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.218
You want me to do it?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.562
( sighs )

33:52.498 --> 33:54.633
( soft moaning )

33:58.404 --> 34:00.272
( breathes in deeply )

34:00.306 --> 34:02.474
( exhales )

34:05.377 --> 34:06.812
( groans )

34:06.845 --> 34:09.447
( soft groaning )

34:09.481 --> 34:13.119
( inhales, groans )

34:17.356 --> 34:19.658
( shallow breathing )

34:41.413 --> 34:44.783
Ba ba, wo ai ne.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.513
( quiet crying )

35:17.449 --> 35:18.384
Lab called on
Vivadee Sanito.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.818
The coags were QNS.

35:19.851 --> 35:24.190
Okay. And, uh, Betty Muldoon
was admitted to Medicine.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.526
Can I get a cab voucher? Huh?

35:27.559 --> 35:30.596
I don't think we're quite ready
to discharge you, Mr. Claus.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.466
Dialysis for patient Sanders.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.634
You want me to...?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.336
No, no, I got it.
Thank you.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.205
Hi. Thanks for coming in.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.639
Double overtime
on holidays.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.474
But I just did Robert
Sanders yesterday.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.810
Yeah, he's, um,
he's fluid overloaded.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.345
MacPherson
call in orders?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.479
Well, I spoke to him
on the phone.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.647
What did he want?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.516
Usual...
the standard... run.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.819
2K bath, 35 bicarb,
pull off a couple liters.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.221
Two or four hours?

35:55.221 --> 35:56.322
Uh, I'm not sure
about that.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.523
I'll give him a call.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.291
Well, actually,
you know, Dr. MacPherson

35:59.325 --> 36:01.527
very specifically said he did
not want to be disturbed, so...

36:01.560 --> 36:02.828
He wouldn't come in?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.530
( sighs )

36:04.563 --> 36:05.797
He wouldn't come in.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.233
( chuckles )

36:07.233 --> 36:09.235
What a ...,
but I need orders.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.502
(sighs):
Okay.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.838
Okay, well, do you think
you could get started,

36:12.871 --> 36:14.673
and then call him?

36:14.706 --> 36:15.674
Sure.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.276
Thank you.
All right.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.478
Thank you.
You're welcome.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.681
MacPherson ordered dialysis?

36:22.714 --> 36:24.683
Uh...

36:24.716 --> 36:27.619
No... I did.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.555
You? You can't order...

36:32.724 --> 36:34.760
Thank you.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.363
Merry Christmas.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.565
Hmm.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.533
MARQUEZ:
Tetanus up to date.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.335
I was putting a
sled together,

36:43.369 --> 36:45.404
and I sliced myself
on the metal runners.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.807
Well, it doesn't look too bad
to me, Mr. Rotolo.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.443
Santa's got to get home,
Doc, know what I mean?

36:51.477 --> 36:53.545
Me and Mrs. Claus have
things to take care of

36:53.579 --> 36:55.447
before the kids wake up.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.748
Won't take long.

36:56.782 --> 36:57.916
You feel that?
Yeah.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.285
Feel that?
Yeah.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.452
Excuse me, Dr. Carter,

37:00.486 --> 37:02.288
uh, when you
have a minute?

37:02.321 --> 37:05.724
Sure. Um, irrigate,
open up a suture kit.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.826
I'll be right back.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.498
I have something for you.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.900
Um, but I haven't wrapped
it, and it's at home...

37:14.933 --> 37:17.469
Liar. But my birthday's
in two weeks.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.505
"Mildred"?

37:19.538 --> 37:21.473
Ooh, sorry.
Mildred didn't show.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.842
I was giving out
a bunch of these.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.478
Just a little something.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.913
So, how was your phone call?

37:29.014 --> 37:31.483
It was good.
She's good.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.819
Oh, yeah, very handy.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.054
For, uh, hooking
up the VCR.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.590
Right, yeah.

37:38.624 --> 37:39.958
Oh...

37:39.991 --> 37:42.594
Yeah. You look like
an old-fashioned doctor.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.631
Well... I am an old-
fashioned doctor.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.604
Okay.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.341
Okay.
Okay.
Merry Christmas.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.743
Merry Christmas.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.044
Ho, Ho, Ho.
Merry Christmas.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.846
RAPHAELLA:
We got sliders.
Yes.

38:00.879 --> 38:04.350
You will never be more loved
than you are at this moment.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.518
Oh, I could eat about
three dozen of these.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.653
Hi.
Hi.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.655
So is this the
little homeless boy?

38:09.688 --> 38:11.523
Should we treat
as inpatient?

38:11.557 --> 38:12.491
Is he hypoxic?

38:12.524 --> 38:13.659
No.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.826
Tolerating POs?

38:14.860 --> 38:16.061
Yeah.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.664
Then he only needs
PO antibiotics.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.832
And a warm bed.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.668
I'll call
the Pedes team.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.003
Hi, Rudolfo.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.639
Hello, doctoras.

38:27.673 --> 38:28.774
Hi.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.041
You got a chimney?

38:30.075 --> 38:32.110
I'm sorry, honey, what?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.712
How's Santa Claus
going to find me

38:33.745 --> 38:35.013
if you don't
got a chimney?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.082
LOCKHART:
You don't need a chimney.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.850
Santa sees everything--
he'll find you.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.086
But you'll have to go to sleep
before he comes, all right?

38:41.119 --> 38:43.689
LOCKHART:
Good night.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.724
Thank you.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.759
Do you think Dad has
a present for his son?

38:47.793 --> 38:50.562
Doubt Dad's got enough
for their breakfast
in the morning.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.531
I guess Santa Claus better
come up with something.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.400
Jumbo mart?
Do you have any
cash on you?

38:54.433 --> 38:56.101
No.
No.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.541
Jing-Mei?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.676
It's been over an hour.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.983
You okay?

39:13.752 --> 39:16.855
I'll call the mortuary
in the morning.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.891
What are you going to do
after that?

39:19.925 --> 39:22.594
( sighs heavily )

39:22.628 --> 39:24.996
Well, I have to go to China

39:25.030 --> 39:28.434
and bury my father
next to my mom.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.736
Deal with his estate.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.604
Bum around,

39:32.638 --> 39:34.573
maybe visit the village
where they were born.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.741
Meet some relatives.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.743
I don't know.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.447
I'm pretty tired.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.681
Well, you know,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.584
if there's anything
I could do.

39:45.617 --> 39:46.918
I mean it-- anything.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.454
Thank you.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.458
Thank you.
Thank you for...

39:52.491 --> 39:55.093
( crying )
It's okay.
Come here.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.463
Come here.

40:01.132 --> 40:05.704
( crying )

40:05.737 --> 40:07.105
Where are we going?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.707
Ho, Ho, Ho, and
a jolly old soul.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.108
Sikhs don't
have Christmas.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.477
I grew up in England

40:11.510 --> 40:13.078
with Old King Wenceslas,
Boxing Day,

40:13.111 --> 40:16.615
and a family tradition
of anonymous kindness.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.183
Where'd you
get that key?

40:18.216 --> 40:19.618
Wendall from Social Work.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.488
( whispers ):
I have a plan.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.122
A sly and cunning plan?

40:24.155 --> 40:26.592
Give these toys and books to
the homeless kids in the ER.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.126
Oh...

40:28.159 --> 40:31.663
Stealing from the bad-off
to give to the worse-off.

40:31.697 --> 40:34.099
And we buy new stuff tomorrow
in the after-Christmas sales.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.134
A belated gift
for the Child Life Department.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.803
Do we have ribbons
or-or paper?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.137
We can steal bows

40:39.170 --> 40:42.040
from the decorations
in the cafeteria.

40:43.542 --> 40:47.979
WOMAN:
* O holy night

40:48.013 --> 40:52.784
* The stars
are brightly shining *

40:52.818 --> 40:56.154
* It is the night

40:56.187 --> 41:01.993
* Of our dear Savior's birth

41:02.027 --> 41:06.532
* Long lay the world

41:06.565 --> 41:11.703
* In sin and error pining

41:11.737 --> 41:15.941
* Till He appeared

41:15.974 --> 41:21.813
* And the soul felt its worth

41:21.847 --> 41:26.718
* A thrill of hope

41:26.752 --> 41:31.690
* The weary world rejoices

41:31.723 --> 41:35.694
* For yonder breaks

41:35.727 --> 41:42.033
* A new and glorious morn

41:42.067 --> 41:48.740
* Fall on your knees

41:48.774 --> 41:53.044
* O hear

41:53.078 --> 41:57.082
* Hear the angels singing

41:57.115 --> 42:02.654
* O night divine

42:04.756 --> 42:09.127
* O night

42:09.160 --> 42:12.864
* O holy night

42:16.935 --> 42:22.974
* O night divine.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.843
What's up?
Hey, I thought you'd
be in Miami by now.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.178
O'Hare's a mess.
No seats until tomorrow.

42:27.212 --> 42:29.948
Miami? I thought your mother
was in Philadelphia.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.783
Hey, it's snowing.
Come on.

42:31.817 --> 42:34.252
Hey, if it's snowing,
that means it's warming up.

42:34.285 --> 42:35.854
You knew
he was in Miami?

42:35.887 --> 42:38.189
He's got a girlfriend
that lives there.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.158
I worked his shift
because he gave me

42:40.191 --> 42:41.860
some sob story
about his mother.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.863
Barnett, you back already?

42:44.896 --> 42:47.198
I can't stay away.
( grunts )

42:47.232 --> 42:49.034
Ah... I love it.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.335
Does snow get polluted?

42:50.368 --> 42:51.903
MacPHERSON:
Where's Lockhart?

42:51.937 --> 42:53.371
Dr. MacPherson.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.674
I didn't
authorize dialysis

42:55.707 --> 42:58.243
for Sanders and you started
it without my approval.

42:58.276 --> 43:00.045
I want to speak
to your attending.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.680
Uh...

43:01.713 --> 43:02.714
your patient was drowning.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.049
He needed emergent dialysis.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.250
You're an attending,
on call,

43:05.283 --> 43:06.718
I covered your ass.

43:06.752 --> 43:08.019
You can't just
deceive attendings

43:08.053 --> 43:09.354
when you don't
agree with them.

43:09.387 --> 43:11.389
Well, if you report me
for working the system,

43:11.422 --> 43:13.324
I'll report you
for abandoning your patient.

43:13.358 --> 43:15.360
Go, Abby.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.328
See you inside.

43:20.398 --> 43:22.233
Ouch!
Miami?

43:22.267 --> 43:24.335
CARTER:
Come on,
let's get back to work.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.239
This is Jing-Mei Chen.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.941
I woke up this morning

43:29.975 --> 43:32.377
and found my father had
passed away in the night.

43:32.410 --> 43:35.814
Yes, he's been very ill.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.085
Well, actually his
physician is here.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.120
He can sign the
death certificate.

43:43.221 --> 43:44.823
Mm-hmm.

43:45.924 --> 43:48.093
Thank you.

43:48.126 --> 43:53.031
It's 2753 West Cedar Drive.
