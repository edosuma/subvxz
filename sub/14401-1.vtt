00:41.342 --> 00:43.168
<i>Will you hark to what they've said?</i>

00:43.260 --> 00:46.594
<i>Or will you move your beeves</i>
<i>from Texas across the river red?</i>

00:47.097 --> 00:50.929
<i>They're betting you can't make it,</i>
<i>but you bet your life they're wrong.</i>

00:51.018 --> 00:54.268
<i>So keep riding toward the Pecos</i>
<i>to find where you belong.</i>

02:22.026 --> 02:24.777
<i>Can you still keep going on?</i>

02:48.427 --> 02:52.756
<i>Well, you've crossed beyond the Brazos,</i>
<i>fought Comanches, rain, and sand.</i>

02:52.973 --> 02:56.888
<i>You brought your cattle westward,</i>
<i>but is this your promised land?</i>

02:57.019 --> 03:00.388
<i>You made it to the Pecos,</i>
<i>carved your empire 'neath the sun.</i>

03:00.481 --> 03:03.766
<i>You won a hundred battles,</i>
<i>but the fight keeps going on.</i>

03:23.921 --> 03:26.791
<i>Can you still keep going on?</i>

04:35.826 --> 04:38.115
You two go ahead.
I'll ride up and fetch him.

04:38.203 --> 04:41.537
He's been up there over an hour.
What's he do on that hill?

04:42.291 --> 04:44.616
I don't think you'd understand.

05:02.686 --> 05:04.560
Thinking about the beginning?

05:04.813 --> 05:06.189
And before.

05:07.358 --> 05:09.481
Everything's different now.

05:12.404 --> 05:13.946
Not everything.

05:15.908 --> 05:17.283
Most everything.

05:18.535 --> 05:23.032
Comanches all penned up. <i>Buscaderos</i>
staying on their side of the Rio Grande.

05:23.207 --> 05:26.291
Yankee Army prodding around,
people crowding in.

05:26.752 --> 05:28.376
Too many changes.

05:29.421 --> 05:32.043
Things usually change for the better.

05:33.384 --> 05:35.376
Let's go meet the stage.

05:50.943 --> 05:54.691
Just what we don't need around here,
some scrawny, milk-drinking...

05:54.780 --> 05:57.567
- What are you mumbling about, Pepper?
- You heard me.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.236
I didn't hear you.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.900
There's an old Comanche saying
about females.

06:01.996 --> 06:03.988
This female's no Comanche.

06:04.456 --> 06:07.078
I guess she doesn't have
nowhere else to go.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.122
- She does.
- Then what's she coming here for?

06:10.462 --> 06:12.953
Because she wrote and said she was.

06:55.466 --> 06:57.873
It has been a long ride, you know.

07:05.517 --> 07:09.467
- All of this belongs to Chisum.
- All this and much more.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.648
Much land, much horses, and much cattle.

07:13.525 --> 07:14.984
Too much. No?

07:16.195 --> 07:18.650
Neemo, here's your pay.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.735
And now I collect a bonus...

07:24.870 --> 07:26.151
from Chisum.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.924
He thinks he's going to a picnic.

07:47.142 --> 07:48.934
He ain't met Chisum yet.

07:49.812 --> 07:52.516
- I wanna be elsewhere when he does.
- We will be.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.015
Come on. Giddyup.

09:24.573 --> 09:25.604
Come on.

09:31.121 --> 09:33.114
"L.G. Murphy and Company."

09:43.967 --> 09:46.459
I told you Murphy was throwing
a wide loop.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.471
There's no law against a man
going into business...

09:49.556 --> 09:51.051
or businesses.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.263
There's more of it.

09:56.855 --> 09:58.480
One day he's gonna take over...

09:58.565 --> 10:01.021
Quit picking on him.
He hasn't bothered us.

10:01.235 --> 10:03.904
Wait and see. He'll rue the day.

10:11.704 --> 10:14.195
Why the hell they call it the noon stage?

10:14.331 --> 10:17.000
Half the time it don't get in
before sundown.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.077
Had to call it something.

10:19.837 --> 10:21.664
Might as well wet our windpipes.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.590
That's the most sensible thing
I've heard all day.

10:39.523 --> 10:43.437
- Amos, what's going on here?
- Pulling out, John.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.985
I hadn't heard you'd sold the place.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.564
Didn't sell. Lost it. New owner.

10:52.036 --> 10:54.112
If you needed money, I'm sure...

10:54.329 --> 10:56.618
All the credit you've given around here.

10:56.707 --> 10:59.624
No, John, it's not just the money.
It's, well...

11:00.336 --> 11:01.534
I don't know.

11:02.254 --> 11:04.626
Lincoln just ain't the same no more.

11:04.882 --> 11:06.542
I'm heading for Yuma.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.655
Mr. Chisum!

11:31.909 --> 11:34.447
Jim and Tyke's been shot.
They took the remuda.

11:34.536 --> 11:35.912
How many are there?

11:35.996 --> 11:38.452
A dozen, heading south,
over at the Tunstall spread.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.118
Let's go get 'em back.

11:49.468 --> 11:51.591
Chisum's again. Another jinglebob, sir.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.256
- Turn him loose.
- Yes, sir.

11:53.430 --> 11:56.301
Another jinglebob. Big old calf on her.
No brand.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.847
He belongs with his mother.
Turn him loose.

11:58.936 --> 12:00.596
Turn him loose, Charlie.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.023
I don't see why we can't keep the calf.
Probably born on your land.

12:06.276 --> 12:08.898
William, "Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's property."

12:08.988 --> 12:10.980
That calf's out of a Chisum cow.

12:11.448 --> 12:14.283
Yeah, but she's probably sired
by a Tunstall bull.

12:26.588 --> 12:29.625
- You know 'em, sir?
- Yes, William, I do.

12:30.259 --> 12:33.094
As a matter of fact,
it's the owner of those cows.

12:35.431 --> 12:36.711
- Henry.
- John.

12:36.849 --> 12:38.640
Thought you were meeting
your niece today.

12:38.726 --> 12:41.430
I aim to.
First I gotta get some horses back.

12:41.645 --> 12:43.685
- Trouble?
- Horse thieves.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.769
- Could you use some help, Mr. Chisum?
- William.

12:47.985 --> 12:49.728
See you later, Henry.

13:00.581 --> 13:03.747
Mr. Tunstall,
I know you don't believe in guns...

13:04.293 --> 13:07.496
but I got a feeling
Mr. Chisum's gonna have need of his.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.671
- Well...
- Well, what?

13:12.301 --> 13:13.878
He didn't say no.

13:34.365 --> 13:37.200
- How do we work this?
- I'm going down there.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.822
The rest of you cover me
with your long guns.

13:42.331 --> 13:44.537
- I said...
- I heard you, Mr. Chisum...

13:44.625 --> 13:46.202
but I ain't the rest of 'em.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.044
Welcome, my friend.

13:55.761 --> 13:59.379
My name's Chisum.
Those animals are mine.

14:00.265 --> 14:03.219
- There must be some mistake here.
- You made it.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.721
No, Chisum. You make the mistake.

14:09.525 --> 14:12.063
You don't bring enough men with you.

14:12.903 --> 14:16.402
Mr. Chisum said to stay here
and cover him with our long guns.

14:16.490 --> 14:18.981
Never was much good with a long gun.

14:21.245 --> 14:22.739
But I tell you what.

14:23.038 --> 14:26.454
We have a long way to go,
and a horse is a lot of trouble.

14:27.209 --> 14:30.910
So if you want these horses,
I sell them to you.

14:32.131 --> 14:34.704
Did you bring some gold with you?

14:36.427 --> 14:37.458
No.

14:38.679 --> 14:39.877
Silver?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.468
Just lead.

14:44.226 --> 14:47.595
No. You can't buy anything with lead.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.773
I guess I have to kill you
and take your horses, too.

15:23.682 --> 15:26.885
Let 'em go, mister.
We got what we came after.

15:32.149 --> 15:33.809
Pretty good shooting, young fella.

15:33.901 --> 15:37.317
- You three all right?
- You bet we're all right. American.

15:39.782 --> 15:42.866
You go and meet your niece.
We'll take care of things around here.

15:42.951 --> 15:44.196
Thanks, Henry.

15:45.955 --> 15:49.489
About that reception for Sallie,
bring this young fella along.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.335
I will, and it's about time
you two were introduced.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.997
This is William Bonney.

15:54.838 --> 15:57.127
- Bonney?
- Came to work for me last month.

15:57.341 --> 15:59.749
William Bonney from up Silver City way?

16:00.177 --> 16:01.340
Sometimes.

16:02.638 --> 16:05.473
You also called Billy the Kid?

16:06.058 --> 16:07.386
Sometimes.

16:13.065 --> 16:15.104
Does that change your mind, Mr. Chisum?

16:18.279 --> 16:20.188
An invitation's an invitation.

16:20.698 --> 16:21.943
Thanks, John.

16:25.703 --> 16:28.194
Letting the fox into the henhouse,
that's what it is.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.862
- Pepper, what are you mumbling about?
- Nothing.

16:30.958 --> 16:32.832
It didn't sound like nothing.

16:32.918 --> 16:34.543
You invited him.

16:35.587 --> 16:37.876
Yeah, I did.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.601
But, <i>señor,</i> we have always watered
our herds at Muddy Creek.

16:58.819 --> 17:01.986
As I explained to your friends,
Muddy Creek's private now.

17:02.072 --> 17:03.235
Bourbon.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.233
But, <i>señor,</i> our herds are small.

17:05.326 --> 17:08.611
There is more than enough water
at Muddy Creek, and yesterday...

17:08.704 --> 17:10.328
I know all about yesterday.

17:10.414 --> 17:13.913
Now listen, Delgado.
I told them then, and I'm telling you now.

17:14.042 --> 17:16.580
And if you don't understand plain English...

17:16.795 --> 17:18.954
maybe there's something else
you will understand.

17:19.048 --> 17:20.839
Dolan, just a minute.

17:22.259 --> 17:25.094
I'm sorry, <i>Señor</i> Delgado?

17:25.179 --> 17:26.507
<i>Sí, Señor Murphy.</i>

17:26.597 --> 17:30.808
I'm gonna be running a lot of beef,
and I need every drop of water I can get.

17:30.935 --> 17:32.263
I'm sorry.

17:34.313 --> 17:36.602
- Juan.
- <i>Sí, Señor Chisum.</i>

17:36.940 --> 17:40.724
You and your <i>compadres</i>
can water your herds along the Jicarilla.

17:40.819 --> 17:43.571
It's not much farther,
and it's a whole lot cleaner.

17:43.656 --> 17:44.936
<i>Gracias.</i>

17:46.033 --> 17:48.571
- What are you waiting for?
- <i>Gracias, señor.</i>

17:50.329 --> 17:53.246
John, that's very generous of you.
Buy you a drink?

17:54.124 --> 17:56.615
You've been buying a lot of things
around here lately.

17:56.710 --> 18:00.210
Yeah, I just acquired some land
that's contiguous to your spread.

18:00.297 --> 18:01.626
But, what the hell?

18:01.924 --> 18:05.174
Half of New Mexico territory
is contiguous to your spread.

18:05.344 --> 18:08.131
Let me have my bottle.
John and I are gonna have a drink.

18:08.222 --> 18:09.882
- Nope.
- Why not?

18:10.724 --> 18:13.476
- I don't like you.
- You don't know me.

18:13.644 --> 18:15.387
I know Amos Patton.

18:16.397 --> 18:18.804
We may have to be neighbors...

18:19.441 --> 18:21.351
but I don't have to be neighborly.

18:26.282 --> 18:30.196
I heard you ran into some trouble today.
Can I do anything for you?

18:30.285 --> 18:33.619
Brady, aren't you standing
on the wrong side of that badge?

18:35.249 --> 18:37.491
I'm the new sheriff, duly appointed.

18:38.877 --> 18:40.953
Noon stage got in, Mr. Chisum.

18:41.630 --> 18:44.002
What do you think, Pete? 4:30 p.m.

18:44.091 --> 18:46.878
Old Jeb made good time. Whiskey.

18:47.928 --> 18:51.379
- Mr. Chisum, if I can do anything for you...
- Not likely.

18:53.517 --> 18:54.762
Sheriff.

19:06.155 --> 19:08.028
Your name John Chisum?

19:09.033 --> 19:12.366
- That's right.
- I thought so. My name's Alex McSween.

19:12.661 --> 19:15.366
My wife and I came in on the stage
with Sallie.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.697
That's very nice. Where...

19:17.791 --> 19:20.199
She went over to that stable over there.

19:20.669 --> 19:22.876
Much obliged. Pepper. Pardon.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.879
- What's she doing in there?
- How should I know?

19:30.220 --> 19:33.221
- Uncle John. You got $50 on you?
- $50?

19:36.560 --> 19:37.758
Thanks.

19:38.854 --> 19:41.559
- You're welcome, and hello!
- Hello!

19:43.609 --> 19:45.566
- She's your niece.
- Yeah.

19:48.906 --> 19:50.898
Uncle John, meet Bernard.

19:52.076 --> 19:53.274
Bernard?

19:53.702 --> 19:56.905
- You gave $50 for this horse?
- Meet Pepper.

19:57.665 --> 20:00.037
No, $100. I had $50 on me.

20:00.626 --> 20:04.920
I've been thinking about having
my own horse again since I left Baltimore.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.966
You know,
we have a few horses at the ranch.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.589
But those are yours. This one's mine.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.341
- Half yours.
- I'll pay you back the $50.

20:15.140 --> 20:17.382
How about just paying me back?

20:19.937 --> 20:22.606
Cass'll take care of your bags.
Which are yours?

20:22.690 --> 20:25.311
- First one there.
- I see you found her.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.102
- Yes.
- Uncle John...

20:27.194 --> 20:29.103
- We've met.
- That's good.

20:29.196 --> 20:32.150
I've invited the McSweens
to that party you wrote me about.

20:32.241 --> 20:34.317
You did? How about you folks?

20:34.410 --> 20:36.817
Have you a place to stay
until you get settled?

20:36.912 --> 20:38.739
That's very nice of you, but...

20:38.831 --> 20:40.455
Sue and I are staying in town.

20:40.541 --> 20:43.162
I'm going to work
for L.G. Murphy and Company.

20:44.878 --> 20:46.836
Yes, I know the company.

20:47.798 --> 20:50.123
If you'll pardon us,
we'd better get underway.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.625
- Goodbye.
- We'll see you Friday.

20:53.095 --> 20:56.464
There sure is gonna be
some interesting people at that party.

21:13.157 --> 21:15.149
There's Mr. Murphy, honey.

21:41.518 --> 21:42.763
Dominoes?

21:55.157 --> 21:58.028
It's quiet. Takes some getting used to.

21:58.327 --> 22:00.818
It beats Aunt Martha and Baltimore.

22:02.164 --> 22:04.370
I had no idea your ranch was so big.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.037
Fair size.

22:06.418 --> 22:09.253
Take a man on a good horse
all summer to cover it.

22:10.547 --> 22:12.090
It's beautiful.

22:12.549 --> 22:14.957
No place on God's earth more beautiful.

22:15.594 --> 22:18.132
I can see why you left Texas
and came here.

22:19.139 --> 22:21.891
- That wasn't exactly the reason.
- I know.

22:22.017 --> 22:23.844
Mother told me all about it.

22:24.186 --> 22:27.021
About how hard things were in Texas
after the war.

22:27.106 --> 22:28.897
She talked about you a lot.

22:29.358 --> 22:31.683
How you gambled everything
on a cattle drive...

22:31.777 --> 22:34.350
to some wild, faraway place
called New Mexico.

22:34.446 --> 22:38.029
It was a gamble, all right. And it was wild.

22:39.159 --> 22:42.160
But there was land here
for the taking and keeping...

22:42.997 --> 22:44.906
if you were willing to fight.

22:45.541 --> 22:48.032
Rustlers, disease...

22:49.211 --> 22:51.417
the land itself, the Indians...

22:52.047 --> 22:53.921
One Indian in particular.

22:54.049 --> 22:57.050
Comanche chief named White Buffalo.

22:58.512 --> 23:00.469
He was the bravest man I ever knew.

23:00.556 --> 23:03.094
- Is he dead now?
- Might as well be.

23:03.183 --> 23:07.513
He's penned up on a piece of desert
the government calls a reservation.

23:09.315 --> 23:11.473
That was the end of his way of life.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.692
Pretty good way, too.

23:13.819 --> 23:16.606
You sound as if you're sorry for him,
your enemy.

23:16.947 --> 23:19.865
I respect him. We're brothers.

23:20.326 --> 23:22.532
As close as your father and I were.

23:22.995 --> 23:24.489
Maybe even closer.

23:25.164 --> 23:27.951
- I don't understand.
- I didn't expect you to.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.618
I wonder what's keeping supper?

23:31.295 --> 23:34.130
- That's Mother and Dad's wedding picture.
- Yeah.

23:37.176 --> 23:38.551
North wind.

23:39.053 --> 23:41.970
<i>Tahnimara</i> the Comanches call it.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.344
- Lonely wind.
- Lonely wind.

23:46.977 --> 23:49.647
You had to be Ionely out here
all these years.

23:50.064 --> 23:51.724
You never married.

23:52.107 --> 23:55.559
It wasn't because there weren't women
that stirred my blood.

23:55.944 --> 23:57.320
There were.

23:57.905 --> 24:01.155
This was no place to bring a woman
in those days...

24:01.992 --> 24:03.486
raise a family...

24:05.329 --> 24:07.321
Things are different now.

24:08.290 --> 24:09.749
Uncle John...

24:12.503 --> 24:15.207
thanks for asking me
to come and stay with you.

24:15.965 --> 24:17.589
I didn't ask you.

24:25.099 --> 24:28.598
$12 for a suit of clothes.
That's robbery, Mr. Tunstall.

24:28.685 --> 24:32.185
You've got to be properly dressed
for the reception tonight.

24:32.481 --> 24:35.233
- I'll pay you back at the end of the month.
- No, you won't.

24:35.317 --> 24:38.022
That's just part of your raise
as line foreman.

24:38.112 --> 24:40.863
- Line foreman?
- Laddie, you've earned it.

24:52.751 --> 24:54.708
Thank you, Mr. Tunstall.

25:07.808 --> 25:10.133
Billy? Hey, Billy!

25:19.361 --> 25:21.852
Now ain't this just like old times?

25:23.532 --> 25:26.568
Billy, you do remember the boys now,
don't you?

25:29.079 --> 25:30.194
Yeah.

25:32.833 --> 25:36.036
- How you been, Billy?
- Clean and forward, all the way.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.745
Are you two friends, William?

25:39.423 --> 25:42.756
Mister, a couple of years ago,
William here and me...

25:42.843 --> 25:45.334
rode together both sides of the border.

25:45.763 --> 25:48.929
We sure had some real good times,
didn't we, Billy?

25:49.349 --> 25:51.757
Some good, some not as good.

25:52.686 --> 25:55.771
- What are you doing now, Billy?
- I work for Mr. Tunstall here.

25:56.523 --> 25:58.481
- You nursing cows?
- Yeah.

25:59.401 --> 26:00.860
Our own cows.

26:01.987 --> 26:04.443
Now, just what is that supposed to mean?

26:04.990 --> 26:07.695
It means it ain't like old times, Jess.

26:09.703 --> 26:12.657
That's interesting, William.

26:35.854 --> 26:37.977
- Jess Evans?
- Yeah.

26:38.107 --> 26:39.435
I'm Riker.

26:39.817 --> 26:42.983
- We've been waiting for you.
- You don't have to wait anymore.

26:43.070 --> 26:45.228
- How's things in Dodge?
- Dead.

28:18.749 --> 28:20.872
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

28:23.337 --> 28:26.207
- Here's your bourbon.
- On the inside.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.255
- Confusion to the enemy.
- Sure.

28:33.555 --> 28:36.722
Mr. McSween, how long have you known
Lawrence G. Murphy?

28:36.892 --> 28:41.435
Not long. I was here on business recently,
and he offered me a proposition.

28:42.189 --> 28:44.347
So I went on back to Kansas...

28:44.525 --> 28:46.932
and wound things up,
and came on back to Sioux.

28:47.027 --> 28:50.776
- What are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna handle his legal affairs.

28:52.199 --> 28:54.357
Are you looking for your niece?

28:54.952 --> 28:58.617
Isn't that her dancing with
that nice-Iooking young fellow over there?

28:58.706 --> 29:01.493
- Yeah.
- Fine-Iooking couple, John.

29:28.819 --> 29:31.773
- Give me another cup of that tar, Ben?
- Sure, Jeff.

29:46.295 --> 29:47.872
Hello, the camp!

30:03.896 --> 30:05.390
Stranger, ain't you?

30:05.481 --> 30:08.102
Around here. Not other places.

30:10.986 --> 30:14.355
It's a fair-sized gathering of beeves
you've got out there.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.940
- Lose your horse?
- Some miles back.

30:18.827 --> 30:22.113
- Whose brand's on 'em?
- Tonight it's John Chisum's.

30:22.623 --> 30:24.829
Tomorrow it'll be the U.S. Army's.

30:25.501 --> 30:29.249
- Buffalo hunter?
- Was, till there was no more buffalo.

30:31.757 --> 30:33.500
The coffee smells good.

30:33.884 --> 30:36.589
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

30:40.265 --> 30:42.057
Garrett. Pat Garrett.

30:49.942 --> 30:51.851
You know they've got company.

30:51.944 --> 30:53.936
- Who?
- Mr. Chisum's beeves.

30:54.822 --> 30:56.613
What kind of company?

30:57.700 --> 30:59.242
It's good coffee.

30:59.326 --> 31:02.113
About 12, 14 riders moving slow and quiet.

31:04.164 --> 31:07.580
- You want some company?
- How do we know you're not with them?

31:07.960 --> 31:10.877
- I'll stay and finish the coffee.
- No. You come along with us.

31:11.005 --> 31:12.415
I'll need a horse.

31:12.715 --> 31:15.003
Take the buckskin. Let's go!

31:43.162 --> 31:44.537
Take cover!

31:47.458 --> 31:50.209
Bring 'em on! Now pour it to 'em!

31:50.919 --> 31:52.829
Scare up them beeves!

32:30.918 --> 32:32.163
Let's go.

32:45.974 --> 32:47.255
This one's just creased.

32:47.351 --> 32:49.509
We'll take him back to Mr. Chisum.

32:54.858 --> 32:58.274
Lock him up in the smokehouse.
We'll take him to town in the morning.

32:58.362 --> 32:59.607
What about the herd?

32:59.697 --> 33:02.651
All them beeves are scattered
from here to next week.

33:02.741 --> 33:05.197
Sure ain't gonna deliver 'em
to the Army tomorrow.

33:05.285 --> 33:07.029
Gather as many as you can.

33:08.038 --> 33:10.446
He'll probably be your first legal affair.

33:10.541 --> 33:12.747
What do you mean by that?

33:12.835 --> 33:15.041
I don't know what I mean yet.

33:16.130 --> 33:18.336
Thank you for the help,
Mr. Garrett, was it?

33:18.424 --> 33:19.799
Pat Garrett.

33:19.883 --> 33:21.342
- Texas?
- Texas.

33:21.969 --> 33:23.000
Looking for a job?

33:23.220 --> 33:26.803
Not just now. I saved a small poke.
I thought I'd try my hand at gambling.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.428
- Good.
- I'd appreciate the loan of a horse, though.

33:29.518 --> 33:31.392
Take your choice and keep it.

33:31.478 --> 33:33.352
- Thank you.
- You hungry?

33:33.605 --> 33:36.357
No, but I didn't get a chance
to finish that cup of coffee.

33:36.567 --> 33:39.437
Coffee? I think we can do better than that.

33:49.246 --> 33:51.369
- That girl.
- What about her?

33:51.457 --> 33:53.912
She's pretty enough to be from Texas.

33:54.001 --> 33:56.753
She is from Texas. You ought to meet her.

33:59.465 --> 34:01.920
Sallie, I want you to meet Pat Garrett.

34:02.009 --> 34:04.714
- This is my niece, Miss Chisum.
- How do you do?

34:06.597 --> 34:08.672
Pat Garrett, meet Billy Bonney.

34:09.934 --> 34:11.096
Hello.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.857
I've heard of you.

34:21.737 --> 34:23.315
Wasn't rustling.

34:24.322 --> 34:27.110
Just out riding,
and his men started shooting at us.

34:27.284 --> 34:30.652
Just out for a moonlight ride on my land.
Who was with you?

34:31.830 --> 34:33.241
I got nothing more to say.

34:33.331 --> 34:36.167
Don't worry, Mr. Chisum.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.377
Yes, Sheriff,
we will get to the bottom of this.

34:39.545 --> 34:43.626
One of my men is dead.
I've sent for Judge Wilson over in Mesilla.

34:43.801 --> 34:45.793
There's gonna be a murder trial.

34:45.886 --> 34:47.795
I ought to have a doctor.

34:47.971 --> 34:50.130
- I bled some.
- Not enough.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.967
The Sheriff's charming.

34:53.185 --> 34:56.636
There's a lot of charming people
hereabouts, Pat.

34:57.439 --> 34:59.811
If you change your mind about that job,
let me know.

34:59.900 --> 35:02.605
Sounds good enough.
You got time for a drink?

35:03.820 --> 35:05.647
- Bourbon?
- Just one.

35:08.909 --> 35:10.700
It's a big move for Sue and me.

35:10.786 --> 35:12.743
You don't have any idea how big.

35:12.913 --> 35:15.036
I've only been out here for a short time.

35:15.666 --> 35:19.533
But I'm putting together an organization
bigger than anything the West has seen:

35:19.878 --> 35:23.081
Land, mining, cattle,
freighting, speculation.

35:23.173 --> 35:26.839
That does sound big.
And it sounds like it'll take a lot of doing.

35:26.927 --> 35:30.426
You'll find I'm pretty well-connected here.
Here, look at this.

35:30.681 --> 35:33.801
I can show you a shortcut
to the whole proposition. Chisum.

35:33.893 --> 35:37.261
The King of the Pecos.
He got here first. He holds the key.

35:37.354 --> 35:39.928
The Pecos River
runs through the middle of his land.

35:40.024 --> 35:41.138
So?

35:41.233 --> 35:44.234
He lets the water flow to all the ranches,
big and small.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.187
If another man, with more appetite,
owned that land...

35:48.824 --> 35:52.952
he'd control a territory bigger
than most states and some countries.

35:53.579 --> 35:56.248
- Yeah, but another man doesn't.
- I know. Not yet.

35:56.331 --> 36:00.459
But that's not just a map.
That's a chessboard.

36:01.045 --> 36:03.796
And if another man
makes the right moves...

36:04.965 --> 36:07.883
there might just be
a new King of the Pecos.

36:08.343 --> 36:10.051
Gentlemen, come in.

36:11.847 --> 36:14.883
Sheriff Brady, Jess Evans,
this is Alex McSween.

36:15.559 --> 36:17.018
He's part of the family.

36:17.102 --> 36:18.727
- Howdy.
- What does he do?

36:18.812 --> 36:21.730
He used to be a storekeeper,
and now he's my lawyer.

36:22.107 --> 36:23.518
I prefer storekeepers.

36:23.901 --> 36:25.810
Then don't ever get arrested.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.566
I don't intend to.

36:28.071 --> 36:29.447
Neither did Riker.

36:30.115 --> 36:31.230
- Lawrence...
- Okay.

36:31.325 --> 36:32.570
All right, Sheriff.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.744
Listen, Alex,
would you excuse us for a minute?

36:36.330 --> 36:37.658
Certainly.

36:43.128 --> 36:46.580
First it was Neemo, then Riker.
Now Chisum's sent for Judge Wilson.

36:46.674 --> 36:50.007
- What do we do?
- Have some wanted posters printed up.

36:50.469 --> 36:51.928
- On who?
- Riker.

36:52.346 --> 36:55.263
- What for?
- Your prisoner's going to escape.

36:56.433 --> 36:57.927
- He is?
- He is.

36:58.644 --> 37:01.217
Tell him to wait in the line shack
on Bony Ridge...

37:01.313 --> 37:03.472
till the judge gets tired of waiting around.

37:03.899 --> 37:05.939
- How much?
- How much what?

37:06.068 --> 37:08.606
- How much reward? $100, or...
- No.

37:08.696 --> 37:12.645
Don't be a piker, man. $200...
Nobody's gonna collect it.

37:14.451 --> 37:17.820
Why get in a frazzle over Chisum?
You turn me loose on him...

37:17.913 --> 37:20.487
there'll be a sudden funeral
right here in Lincoln.

37:22.584 --> 37:23.747
Yours.

37:25.796 --> 37:26.959
How's that?

37:27.047 --> 37:29.040
- Do you play chess?
- Chess?

37:30.217 --> 37:32.790
What the hell has that got to do
with Chisum?

37:32.928 --> 37:36.344
Everything. You just leave him alone.
I'll take care of him.

37:36.682 --> 37:39.054
- That ain't gonna be easy.
- You're right.

37:39.310 --> 37:42.560
But there's a fundamental difference
between Mr. Chisum and me.

37:42.646 --> 37:43.726
What's that?

37:43.814 --> 37:46.519
Mr. Chisum is a man
who respects the law.

37:46.984 --> 37:49.605
Around here, I'm the man who owns it.

37:51.238 --> 37:54.405
Get out of here! You miserable...

37:56.827 --> 37:58.487
Next one goes in your gut.

37:58.954 --> 38:00.828
Put the gun away, William.

38:14.511 --> 38:16.884
- What's the trouble, Juan?
- No trouble.

38:17.264 --> 38:20.349
This greaser was just trying to tell me
how to run my business.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.510
And just how did he go about that?

38:22.603 --> 38:25.687
They have nearly doubled the prices.
We can't pay what they ask.

38:25.773 --> 38:27.682
You don't like it, go elsewhere.

38:27.983 --> 38:29.358
Maybe they will.

38:29.777 --> 38:32.184
There is no place within 100 miles.

38:32.654 --> 38:34.943
About those prices, Mr. Murphy.

38:36.867 --> 38:39.702
Prices are always going up.
Sign of a healthy economy.

38:39.787 --> 38:41.245
Or a healthier profit.

38:42.372 --> 38:44.994
If he needs money,
he can arrange a loan at the bank.

38:45.209 --> 38:47.616
The bank'd be happy
to mortgage his spread.

38:47.711 --> 38:50.665
Maybe that's what we need around here.
Another bank.

38:51.632 --> 38:53.790
You plan on starting one, Mr. Chisum?

38:53.884 --> 38:56.173
Why not? All it takes is money.

38:57.221 --> 38:59.712
Yes, we might even start up a store, too.

38:59.807 --> 39:02.724
Just in the spirit of healthy competition,
of course.

39:03.394 --> 39:05.267
Talk to you later, Henry.

39:05.562 --> 39:06.973
Right, John.

39:09.775 --> 39:11.768
- <i>¿Qué tal, Juan?</i>
- <i>Regular.</i>

39:12.695 --> 39:15.399
- <i>Billy, gracias.</i>
- <i>De nada.</i>

39:18.867 --> 39:20.030
Billy.

39:23.664 --> 39:27.033
I see you're still pretty handy
with that six-killer.

39:27.459 --> 39:29.119
I hit where I aim.

39:44.393 --> 39:45.591
Company, halt!

39:46.937 --> 39:49.854
- What else?
- Nothing else, Colonel.

39:49.940 --> 39:53.523
We brought enough beef
for White Buffalo's people to get by.

39:53.777 --> 39:57.727
I'll deliver the rest at the weekend,
if it's all right with you and White Buffalo.

39:57.823 --> 39:58.854
Chisum's word.

39:58.949 --> 40:01.903
I am not interested in your opinion
of Mr. Chisum's word.

40:02.536 --> 40:05.786
Sir, I understand your problem,
but you have to understand mine.

40:05.998 --> 40:07.457
Would you mind explaining?

40:07.791 --> 40:11.291
There are many problems attendant
to running such a large territory.

40:11.378 --> 40:13.750
I don't propose to dwell on them
here and now.

40:13.839 --> 40:16.460
What do you propose to do here and now?

40:16.550 --> 40:17.831
I've already done it.

40:18.135 --> 40:20.258
When I heard what happened
to your cattle...

40:20.345 --> 40:24.130
I made arrangements for the delivery
of another herd at a very good price.

40:24.225 --> 40:25.635
Didn't take you very long.

40:25.726 --> 40:28.727
I have to do what is right
for the Army and the territory.

40:28.812 --> 40:31.849
You don't have to put it in triplicate.
I get the idea.

40:33.150 --> 40:34.348
White Buffalo.

40:34.818 --> 40:37.654
Sgt. Braddock will escort you
back to the reservation.

40:37.738 --> 40:39.529
That is all, White Buffalo.

40:39.615 --> 40:40.813
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

40:40.908 --> 40:43.446
- Straightaway.
- All right, follow me.

40:46.497 --> 40:47.659
Chisum.

40:49.833 --> 40:51.625
Into the wagon.

40:53.253 --> 40:54.664
Hey, Indian!

40:55.339 --> 40:57.877
Chisum, this change nothing between us.

40:57.966 --> 41:00.422
You heard the Colonel, blanket-head.
Straightaway.

41:00.511 --> 41:02.005
Just a minute, Sergeant.

41:02.095 --> 41:05.050
- You know who you're talking to?
- Looks like an Indian to me.

41:05.140 --> 41:09.055
- He's a prince of the Comanche nation.
- I don't care if he's the king of Romania.

41:09.144 --> 41:11.351
The Colonel said, "Straightaway."
Let's move it.

41:11.438 --> 41:13.763
Hold on, Sergeant. Have a cigar.

41:15.359 --> 41:17.398
- Have a cigar.
- Don't mind.

41:22.991 --> 41:25.862
One other thing you ought to know.

41:26.328 --> 41:29.412
You touch White Buffalo again
and I'll kill you.

41:38.382 --> 41:40.837
Sergeant, we go now.

41:54.481 --> 41:57.316
Trace, you and Cass take care of the beef.

42:02.531 --> 42:05.900
Count 'em at fours. Forward, ho!

42:09.079 --> 42:10.573
Forward, ho!

42:29.099 --> 42:31.175
Nathan, looks like we're in business.

42:31.643 --> 42:34.763
Are you sure you can provide
that much beef?

42:34.855 --> 42:38.438
Don't worry. Army'll get its beef,
and a lot cheaper than from Chisum.

42:38.817 --> 42:41.190
You're in charge of this territory, not him.

42:41.278 --> 42:43.318
After you've served your tour of duty...

42:43.405 --> 42:45.362
you'll be an officer
in the L.G. Murphy bank.

42:45.449 --> 42:48.900
- Your family will like that.
- Your bank has nothing to do with this.

42:48.994 --> 42:51.319
I'm in the Army. I wouldn't do anything...

42:51.413 --> 42:53.489
And I wouldn't ask you to.

42:53.582 --> 42:55.491
I'll take care of the details.

42:55.918 --> 42:59.203
And I wouldn't do anything
to insult your integrity.

43:09.181 --> 43:10.426
Pepper, look.

43:10.683 --> 43:12.722
Yup. That's ol' Tropadero.

43:12.935 --> 43:15.426
He's led us on many a cattle drive.

43:16.188 --> 43:19.023
He brought your uncle's herd here,
all the way from Texas.

43:19.108 --> 43:22.192
You and Uncle John have come
a long way together, haven't you?

43:23.404 --> 43:24.779
A long way.

43:26.824 --> 43:29.030
Over there's
an old Comanche burying ground.

43:35.207 --> 43:39.419
"The Lord said unto Cain,
'Why art thou wroth?

43:40.671 --> 43:44.669
"'And why is thy countenance fallen?

43:45.384 --> 43:49.547
"'Lf thou doest well,
shalt thou not be accepted?

43:52.307 --> 43:55.392
"'And if thou doest not well...

43:56.145 --> 43:59.514
"'sin lieth at the door.'

44:01.775 --> 44:04.527
"And Cain talked with Abel, his brother.

44:05.154 --> 44:08.439
"And it came to pass,
when they were in the field...

44:09.366 --> 44:12.782
"that Cain rose up
against his brother and...

44:16.874 --> 44:18.249
"slew him."

44:22.379 --> 44:23.542
Howdy.

44:24.339 --> 44:26.877
Do you always greet people
with so much fanfare?

44:26.967 --> 44:28.247
No, ma'am.

44:29.219 --> 44:31.508
Truth is, I was just...

44:32.848 --> 44:34.046
Just what?

44:34.433 --> 44:38.133
Mr. Tunstall loaned me his Bible here
so I could practice my reading.

44:38.228 --> 44:40.517
Looks like that ain't all
you were practicing.

44:40.606 --> 44:43.607
- Which part were you reading?
- About how Cain killed Abel.

44:43.984 --> 44:46.392
You know that was the very first killing?

44:46.487 --> 44:47.862
Yes, I know.

44:49.531 --> 44:51.857
Sure has been a passel of 'em since then.

44:51.950 --> 44:53.445
There sure has.

44:54.036 --> 44:55.613
So long, Bonney.

44:57.539 --> 45:00.077
- Keep practicing, Billy.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:35.828 --> 45:38.070
So they're all in it together.

45:38.664 --> 45:40.870
It may be a chess game to Murphy...

45:40.958 --> 45:44.291
but I don't like his methods,
and I can't go along with him.

45:44.753 --> 45:47.540
It's very kind of you to tell me, Alex...

45:47.798 --> 45:50.336
but I'm a pretty good chess player myself.

45:50.425 --> 45:53.545
If I were you,
I'd cut off the water to his property.

45:53.637 --> 45:57.587
I can't do that without affecting Henry
and a lot of other outfits.

45:57.892 --> 46:00.014
What are you figuring on doing?

46:00.436 --> 46:03.769
Sue's packing,
and we're gonna go on back to Kansas.

46:04.189 --> 46:06.099
Why don't you stay out here?

46:06.191 --> 46:09.276
New Mexico could use
another good man and woman.

46:09.445 --> 46:11.105
Yes, by all means.

46:12.072 --> 46:14.065
What would I do out here?

46:14.324 --> 46:16.994
You ran a store back in Kansas,
didn't you?

46:17.077 --> 46:19.912
We're opening a store and a bank,
aren't we, John?

46:19.997 --> 46:21.325
Rumor has it.

46:21.415 --> 46:25.792
But we need a partner to manage them
and oversee our legal affairs, don't we?

46:25.878 --> 46:28.665
I don't think so. Not any longer.

46:30.424 --> 46:31.966
Just one thing.

46:32.342 --> 46:35.260
You are gonna keep your affairs legal,
aren't you?

46:35.346 --> 46:36.544
Hell, yes.

46:37.681 --> 46:39.674
The three musketeers, eh?

47:26.605 --> 47:28.099
All set, Mr. Chisum.

47:28.190 --> 47:31.357
Two hitched to horses, the rest to mules.
Just like you said.

47:31.443 --> 47:34.065
Here's the letter of credit
for the merchandise.

47:34.154 --> 47:36.443
- The bank in Santa Fe is expecting you.
- Right.

47:36.532 --> 47:38.026
What about Garrett?

47:39.034 --> 47:41.525
- I'll go see.
- Mind if I come along?

47:43.288 --> 47:44.533
Come on.

47:56.677 --> 47:58.468
The size of the pot.

47:59.346 --> 48:00.888
What about you?

48:02.307 --> 48:04.300
- Fold.
- You staying?

48:05.894 --> 48:08.516
- Me, too.
- What about you, Mr. Garrett?

48:10.316 --> 48:11.975
I'll stick around.

48:15.946 --> 48:20.110
You better look out, Mr. Garrett.
I'm hotter than hell on a holiday.

48:21.034 --> 48:23.323
Hi, Mr. Chisum. Care to sit in?

48:23.454 --> 48:26.739
You figure to find that escaped prisoner
in that deck of cards?

48:26.832 --> 48:29.240
Don't worry,
me and the boys will round him up.

48:29.335 --> 48:32.335
Yeah, about the time
you get your third set of teeth.

48:33.338 --> 48:36.090
How about it, Pat?
You made up your mind?

48:37.426 --> 48:39.964
This next card will make up my mind.

48:51.773 --> 48:53.434
I'm playing these.

48:58.864 --> 49:00.193
Big Casino.

49:01.867 --> 49:03.195
I'm going.

49:06.872 --> 49:09.445
Glad to have you with us, Big Casino.

49:10.167 --> 49:12.041
Thanks, Little Casino.

49:20.052 --> 49:22.887
I sure left that Garrett with a short bit.

49:24.723 --> 49:26.846
I'm not so sure you won that hand.

49:26.934 --> 49:29.389
Sure I did. I'm Big Casino.

49:31.438 --> 49:33.182
Yeah, sure you did.

49:55.087 --> 49:56.581
Giddyup!

50:43.677 --> 50:45.136
What do you think?

50:45.220 --> 50:47.794
I think it's a long way
to Santa Fe and back.

50:53.479 --> 50:55.934
You sure you know how to run
one of these things?

50:56.023 --> 50:57.565
All it takes is money.

50:58.776 --> 51:01.611
Yeah. Mine.

51:06.742 --> 51:08.201
Giddyup!

51:41.568 --> 51:44.273
How long before the men get back
from Santa Fe?

51:45.030 --> 51:48.945
They better get here sooner than later.
We're running low on grub.

51:49.368 --> 51:52.535
We're short on sugar, flour, airtights
and everything else.

51:53.747 --> 51:57.911
If they don't get here pretty soon,
we'll be doing business with L.G. Murphy.

51:58.085 --> 52:00.706
They'll be back in two or three days.

52:02.298 --> 52:04.041
I heard the men talking about him...

52:04.133 --> 52:05.841
- and they said that he...
- Who?

52:06.969 --> 52:08.427
Billy Bonney.

52:15.310 --> 52:18.228
They say he killed a man
when he was 12 years old.

52:18.313 --> 52:20.436
He's killed over a dozen men since.

52:20.524 --> 52:22.315
That's what they say.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.400
He's got such gentle eyes.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.997
I don't believe all those stories are true.

52:41.503 --> 52:43.295
It's time for supper.

52:49.386 --> 52:50.465
Well?

52:51.805 --> 52:54.557
- Well, what?
- Well, what are we gonna do?

52:56.018 --> 52:57.975
We're gonna have supper.

53:11.116 --> 53:12.694
One of you the Sheriff?

53:12.785 --> 53:15.738
Nope. Deputies Morton and Baker.
Sheriff's inside.

53:17.748 --> 53:18.946
Get him.

53:20.292 --> 53:21.537
Sheriff?

53:24.254 --> 53:26.211
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.

53:26.507 --> 53:29.377
There's a dodger on him.
I'll collect the bounty.

53:29.510 --> 53:30.755
Who is it?

53:31.387 --> 53:34.091
It's Riker.
Deader than a can of corned beef.

53:36.308 --> 53:39.759
- You just had to kill him.
- No. Less trouble that way.

53:41.313 --> 53:43.519
Get that mess off the street.

53:44.483 --> 53:46.060
You know that gimp?

53:46.151 --> 53:50.398
I know of him. His name's Dan Nodeen.
Half-crazy bounty hunter.

53:51.156 --> 53:53.612
He gimps because of Billy the Kid.

53:54.118 --> 53:56.953
Bonney put a bullet in him
about two years back.

54:03.502 --> 54:05.744
Mr. Nodeen, my name is Murphy.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.998
You wouldn't be looking for a job?

54:11.385 --> 54:13.508
My job's collecting rewards.

54:44.585 --> 54:47.254
- Pat, can you read?
- Yup.

54:48.255 --> 54:50.164
How far did you get in school?

54:50.257 --> 54:52.926
Got through the grades,
then the war broke out.

54:53.010 --> 54:54.883
I never got to school much.

54:55.346 --> 54:57.137
Much? Hardly at all.

54:57.973 --> 55:00.215
But I can read now and do my sums.

55:00.434 --> 55:02.759
Mr. Tunstall's been teaching me.

55:03.187 --> 55:05.678
- He's a good man.
- Yeah, seems like.

55:08.859 --> 55:10.899
What do you hear about me?

55:11.695 --> 55:14.696
Billy, just to hear tell it
made my ears bleed.

55:15.199 --> 55:17.820
I reckon I've run with the worst of 'em.

55:18.243 --> 55:20.236
Jess Evans, Clay Allison.

55:21.538 --> 55:24.076
I'd say you're running
with the best of 'em now.

55:24.166 --> 55:26.704
- Chisum and Tunstall are good company.
- Yeah.

55:29.255 --> 55:33.715
- You ever think on getting married?
- I been three years a buffalo hunter.

55:34.426 --> 55:36.715
What's that got to do
with getting married?

55:36.804 --> 55:37.883
The smell.

55:38.639 --> 55:40.596
- What smell?
- Death.

55:41.517 --> 55:44.434
Buffalo hunters smell like old guts
all the time.

55:44.520 --> 55:47.011
I'm downwind of you, and I don't smell it.

55:47.439 --> 55:49.847
I'm upwind and I smell it on you, Billy.

55:50.317 --> 55:52.642
- What, old guts?
- Death.

55:57.032 --> 55:58.776
Yeah, I see what you mean.

55:59.994 --> 56:02.449
Can it ever go away, that smell?

56:03.372 --> 56:04.996
Sure it can, Billy...

56:05.624 --> 56:07.949
with time, good company, and patience.

56:09.628 --> 56:11.917
- You a patient man?
- Me?

56:13.424 --> 56:15.749
I got the patience of an oyster.

56:25.602 --> 56:27.761
- Take 'em across.
- Let's go!

56:45.789 --> 56:48.161
All right, let's go shopping.

57:05.476 --> 57:06.851
Horse wagon!

57:35.965 --> 57:38.752
Get that horse wagon up there. Get on it!

58:49.955 --> 58:51.414
Well, Doctor, how is he?

58:51.498 --> 58:54.416
Considering he suffered a concussion,
some broken ribs...

58:54.501 --> 58:56.992
swallowed a barrelful of water,
he's all right.

58:57.087 --> 58:59.376
- He's to stay in bed for a few weeks.
- Thanks.

58:59.465 --> 59:01.706
Don't worry. I'll be by this evening.

59:02.134 --> 59:05.301
Pepper, have Cass saddle my horse.

59:05.471 --> 59:08.092
- He's already saddled.
- What do you intend to do?

59:08.182 --> 59:10.720
- See a man about an ambush.
- That's not the way.

59:10.809 --> 59:12.636
- It's my way.
- But your plan worked.

59:12.728 --> 59:14.970
- We got the merchandise.
- And we got Murphy.

59:15.063 --> 59:17.685
Murphy was in town during the raid
with 100 witnesses.

59:17.775 --> 59:20.526
He's surrounded by the law
and by gunmen like Evans.

59:20.611 --> 59:23.481
Henry's right. You're doing
just what they want you to do.

59:23.572 --> 59:25.897
What would you want me to do?
Stand and watch...

59:25.991 --> 59:29.692
I don't propose we stand around.
I'm going to Santa Fe to see the Governor.

59:29.787 --> 59:31.945
Axtell? He's a gutless wonder.

59:32.039 --> 59:35.538
But he'll act under pressure.
I'll tell him everything that's going on.

59:35.626 --> 59:37.499
Justice Wilson will be here soon.

59:37.586 --> 59:39.745
- You said he was a good man.
- Yes, he is.

59:39.838 --> 59:42.164
Don't do anything
to make it harder for him.

59:42.257 --> 59:45.543
True, we wouldn't want him
to have to try you for shooting somebody.

59:45.636 --> 59:46.881
Might be a pleasure.

59:46.970 --> 59:49.010
We'll open up the store and the bank...

59:49.098 --> 59:52.716
and we'll hit Murphy where it hurts.
Legally, without any more gunfire.

59:52.810 --> 59:55.051
Right will prevail. I know it will.

59:55.145 --> 59:58.395
Yes, Henry, right will prevail,
one way or another.

59:59.274 --> 01:00:01.646
But I guess we'll try your way first.

01:00:02.027 --> 01:00:05.147
I'll leave as soon as we put
the store in order.

01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:06.982
Give me that scattergun.

01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:09.447
- You mean, you're gonna...
- Not gonna.

01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:12.320
- Not gonna.
- Not gonna.

01:00:17.459 --> 01:00:19.333
Get us all killed is what'll happen...

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.132
Lawrence!

01:00:39.982 --> 01:00:42.555
- I was just coming to talk to you.
- Talk.

01:00:43.068 --> 01:00:45.773
- Know what I've been doing lately?
- No, what?

01:00:45.863 --> 01:00:47.855
Playing solitaire, that's what.

01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:50.273
Ever since they opened that store.
Look at it.

01:00:50.367 --> 01:00:52.490
The banking hasn't been too good, either.

01:00:52.578 --> 01:00:56.445
Look at those people. Pouring in and out
like they're giving away free whiskey.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.915
Yeah, I can see.

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.453
You know what I think?

01:01:00.544 --> 01:01:03.878
You go back and play solitaire.
I'll do the thinking.

01:01:05.215 --> 01:01:06.294
Jess!

01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:20.645
I finished it, Billy.

01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:29.019
Thinks he's some kind of a war hero,
or something like Davy Crockett.

01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:31.990
- What?
- Nothing.

01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:36.950
Talking to himself more every day.

01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:39.824
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:44.331
Nothing? I heard you say something.
You wasn't talking to yourself, was you?

01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:48.586
It's a sign your saddles are starting to slip
when a man starts talking to himself.

01:01:48.675 --> 01:01:51.083
I said, "Why don't you answer the door?"

01:01:52.346 --> 01:01:54.753
I know you said something. I ain't deaf.

01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:59.804
- Well, Mr. Peaceful himself.
- Hello, Pepper.

01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:02.479
- John.
- Henry.

01:02:02.773 --> 01:02:04.647
- All set to go?
- All set.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.984
Thought I'd pop by and say cheerio,
and see how William's doing.

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.146
- Good.
- He's doing his best.

01:02:10.238 --> 01:02:13.442
- What did you say?
- I said he's getting plenty of rest.

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:16.489
- He's awake now. You can go on in.
- Thank you.

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:25.375
- How's the patient, Sallie?
- A little impatient, I'm afraid.

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.502
- He's getting bored.
- I'm just fine.

01:02:29.216 --> 01:02:32.217
A little buzzing in my head,
but other than that...

01:02:36.265 --> 01:02:40.393
- There is a little hurt when I move.
- Other than that, he's just fine.

01:02:44.439 --> 01:02:46.563
I stopped by to say goodbye.

01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:48.397
Goodbye?

01:02:48.485 --> 01:02:52.234
Yes, I'm going to Santa Fe for a bit,
to take care of some business.

01:02:54.032 --> 01:02:57.567
As soon as I'm able, I got some business
to take care of in Lincoln...

01:02:57.661 --> 01:02:59.239
with Murphy and Evans.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.164
William, you are not going to do anything.

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:05.333
From now on,
we do everything according to the law.

01:03:05.711 --> 01:03:08.202
- Mr. Chisum go along with that?
- He does.

01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:11.874
You've made a fresh start here,
and you've got a good future.

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:16.012
I want you to promise me that
you won't do anything to jeopardize it.

01:03:18.891 --> 01:03:21.263
You're gonna make me swear
on the Bible?

01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:25.221
No, lad. Your word's
always been good enough for me.

01:03:26.231 --> 01:03:30.146
I thought perhaps you'd like to practice
your reading some more while I'm gone.

01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:31.860
Well, thanks. I would.

01:03:32.946 --> 01:03:34.939
I'll see you soon, laddie.

01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:37.782
- Mr. Tunstall.
- Yeah?

01:03:38.452 --> 01:03:39.531
I promise.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.120
I've written a little inscription
on the inside.

01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.766
"To William Bonney.

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:05.551
"February 18, 1878.

01:04:07.356 --> 01:04:10.559
"Prepare your heart
to seek the law of the Lord...

01:04:11.443 --> 01:04:13.151
"and to live by it.

01:04:13.737 --> 01:04:15.481
"J. Henry Tunstall."

01:04:24.873 --> 01:04:27.661
- Good trip, Mr. Tunstall.
- Thank you, Pepper.

01:04:28.126 --> 01:04:30.452
I want to thank you
for taking care of William.

01:04:30.546 --> 01:04:31.826
Not me, Sallie.

01:04:31.922 --> 01:04:34.627
She's a wonderful girl.
And he's a worthwhile lad.

01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:37.290
According to you, everybody's worthwhile.

01:04:37.386 --> 01:04:39.046
God's children, John.

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:41.219
But William reminds me of someone.

01:04:41.306 --> 01:04:45.684
- A black sheep in the family, no doubt.
- No, a young chap I never even talked to.

01:04:45.936 --> 01:04:48.688
Years ago in England,
this young man, like William...

01:04:48.772 --> 01:04:51.097
killed a man in some senseless brawl.

01:04:52.318 --> 01:04:55.104
And I watched that young man
walk to the gallows.

01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:57.821
And I saw him hanged.

01:04:58.365 --> 01:04:59.859
Ghastly sight.

01:05:01.577 --> 01:05:04.862
There was nothing I could do
to help that young lad.

01:05:05.539 --> 01:05:08.990
- I hope your way works, Henry.
- It will, John. It will.

01:05:21.305 --> 01:05:24.756
Would you like to listen to my opinion,
Mr. John Simpson Chisum?

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:25.965
Nope.

01:05:26.185 --> 01:05:29.850
My opinion is all this speechifying,
store-keeping, prayer-meeting...

01:05:29.938 --> 01:05:32.145
don't amount to a spit in the river.

01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:36.729
Only one thing's gonna make this territory
know who's the bull of the woods.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.154
And sometime or sooner,
it's gonna happen. And you know it.

01:05:40.324 --> 01:05:41.818
- Do I?
- You do.

01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:46.489
It's just gonna be you and Murphy,
head to head, and horn to horn.

01:05:46.955 --> 01:05:48.913
And one hell of a fight.

01:05:49.374 --> 01:05:51.581
But one of you has got to lose.

01:05:52.336 --> 01:05:56.084
So, the other one walks away
with the herd and the whole shebang.

01:05:56.423 --> 01:05:58.297
Now, that's my opinion.

01:06:27.162 --> 01:06:28.787
What's so funny?

01:06:30.249 --> 01:06:34.578
That's the first time I ever put
somebody else's brand on our own cows.

01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:45.552
There's your proof, Sheriff.

01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:48.807
No-good cow thief
putting his brand on my cattle.

01:06:49.143 --> 01:06:51.349
I expect we ought to do something
about that.

01:06:51.437 --> 01:06:53.429
Yeah, I expect we ought to.

01:06:53.772 --> 01:06:56.263
And you'd better hurry. He's leaving town.

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.773
All right, you two, go fetch him.

01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:04.688
Hold Tunstall in jail until I get back.

01:07:04.783 --> 01:07:07.072
- Where are you going?
- Santa Fe.

01:07:08.787 --> 01:07:10.661
I've got to see a friend.

01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:24.917
Hello.

01:07:25.012 --> 01:07:28.013
Say, Tunstall,
you're a hard man to track down.

01:07:28.098 --> 01:07:30.885
- Thought you could get away?
- Get away with what?

01:07:31.185 --> 01:07:33.510
We're deputy sheriffs, you know?
Duly appointed.

01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:36.521
My congratulations.
But what's that got to do with me?

01:07:36.607 --> 01:07:39.180
Got to do with your rustling
Mr. Murphy's cattle.

01:07:39.276 --> 01:07:41.019
Gentlemen, in the first place...

01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:45.358
the origin of Mr. Murphy's magic herd
is a bit dubious. In the second place...

01:07:45.449 --> 01:07:49.660
In the second place, don't give us
that fancy foreign talk, Mr. Fancy-pants.

01:07:50.162 --> 01:07:52.700
The law says you're going back to Lincoln.

01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:56.455
Look here, I'm going to Roswell.
I've got a stage to catch.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.224
- He didn't even have a gun.
- He had a gun...

01:08:20.651 --> 01:08:22.228
and he tried to use it.

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:32.697
"And he opened his mouth,
and taught them, saying:

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.779
"'Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:40.161
"'Blessed are they that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

01:08:40.254 --> 01:08:43.337
"'Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:47.042
"'Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness...

01:08:47.135 --> 01:08:48.926
"'for they shall be filled.

01:08:49.263 --> 01:08:52.513
"'Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall experience mercy.

01:08:52.599 --> 01:08:55.635
"'Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.349
"'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
shall be called the children of the Lord.

01:09:00.441 --> 01:09:03.477
"'Blessed are the persecuted
for righteousness' sake...

01:09:03.611 --> 01:09:05.603
"'for they shall inherit heaven.

01:09:06.738 --> 01:09:09.408
"'Rejoice and be doubly blessed...

01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:13.073
"'for your reward in heaven is great.'

01:09:13.412 --> 01:09:16.162
"The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.

01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:18.740
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."

01:09:19.126 --> 01:09:20.323
Amen.

01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:26.715
- John.
- J.B.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:29.999
- How'd it happen?
- It happened.

01:09:31.305 --> 01:09:33.926
- Judge, my name is Alex McSween.
- Yes?

01:09:34.099 --> 01:09:37.265
- I think we should go to the courthouse.
- Mr. McSween...

01:09:38.687 --> 01:09:40.929
I think we'd better go with him.

01:10:24.316 --> 01:10:26.807
I made you a promise, Mr. Tunstall.

01:10:28.279 --> 01:10:30.437
Now I'm making myself a promise.

01:10:31.823 --> 01:10:33.615
It says in the Bible:

01:10:35.577 --> 01:10:38.115
"The candle of the wicked
shall be put out."

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:43.830
Sheriff, I'm gonna ask you just once more.

01:10:43.919 --> 01:10:45.497
- South.
- Chew it finer.

01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:47.373
Valverde, I think.

01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:51.883
Now, let's just hold up a minute.
As a Federal Justice...

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:54.969
I'm issuing warrants
for the arrests of both of those men.

01:10:55.055 --> 01:10:58.139
- Sheriff, are you going after them?
- My own men?

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.349
All right. John, I'm empowering you
and your men to bring back those two...

01:11:02.438 --> 01:11:04.893
- What are their names?
- Morton and Baker.

01:11:04.982 --> 01:11:06.891
Deputies Morton and Baker...

01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:10.230
dead or alive.

01:11:15.409 --> 01:11:19.537
- I'm afraid of what he might do.
- Whatever he does, it'll be legal.

01:11:22.624 --> 01:11:24.498
That's hard to believe.

01:11:24.752 --> 01:11:26.828
Jess Evans rode up
right after the shooting.

01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:30.788
The man is a thief. He stole my cattle.
We have the hides to prove it.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.173
It's hard to believe about Henry Tunstall.

01:11:34.261 --> 01:11:37.178
Yes, and it's hard to believe
he carried a gun. But he did.

01:11:37.347 --> 01:11:39.257
He pulled one. Resisted arrest.

01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:42.724
The deputies were defending themselves.
They had no choice.

01:11:43.854 --> 01:11:45.396
That's too bad.

01:11:46.774 --> 01:11:48.932
- It's just too bad.
- Yes, it is.

01:11:49.026 --> 01:11:51.813
We have more important things
to think about, all of us.

01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:53.813
Would you excuse us, Jess?

01:11:54.156 --> 01:11:57.442
- I'll see you at the hotel.
- Sure. Governor.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.325
All right, Lawrence.
Let's get to our business.

01:12:12.591 --> 01:12:14.667
Howdy. Looks like you rode far.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.010
Haven't seen two men
that look like they'd rode just as far...

01:12:18.097 --> 01:12:19.924
a day or two ahead of us, have you?

01:12:20.015 --> 01:12:23.051
- Fed up their horses here yesterday.
- Where'd they go?

01:12:23.518 --> 01:12:24.633
Where else?

01:12:26.397 --> 01:12:27.594
Thanks.

01:13:03.058 --> 01:13:04.303
Draw.

01:13:06.061 --> 01:13:07.436
Please draw.

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:10.938
- Mr. Chisum, I ain't trying to...
- Where's Morton?

01:13:11.901 --> 01:13:13.311
Second room.

01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:48.930
Bring him along.

01:14:12.211 --> 01:14:13.586
Hold it up.

01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:27.349
- I didn't do it, Mr. Chisum, he did.
- Shut up, Baker.

01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:28.466
Pat.

01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:33.306
You're gonna shoot us, ain't you?

01:14:33.982 --> 01:14:35.643
I thought about it.

01:14:35.984 --> 01:14:39.484
Then I thought about something
Henry Tunstall once said.

01:14:39.863 --> 01:14:43.030
He watched a man walk to the gallows.
Saw him hang.

01:14:43.575 --> 01:14:45.235
Said it was ghastly.

01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:47.327
I've seen men hang.

01:14:48.038 --> 01:14:50.078
And that's the word: Ghastly.

01:14:50.499 --> 01:14:52.159
You two are gonna hang.

01:14:54.378 --> 01:14:56.170
Pat, take 'em on in to Lincoln.

01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:59.007
We'll swing by the ranch
and pick up the judge.

01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:05.503
Let's go.

01:15:38.965 --> 01:15:41.123
Hello, Pat, Charlie, Tom.

01:15:41.716 --> 01:15:45.086
- You shouldn't be up and around, Billy.
- Neither should they.

01:15:45.179 --> 01:15:47.052
They won't be for long.

01:15:47.139 --> 01:15:51.007
- What's gonna happen to 'em?
- They're gonna be tried and hanged.

01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:55.062
- And you believe that?
- John Chisum does.

01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:57.065
We'll see.

01:15:57.983 --> 01:16:01.352
Pat, I never did thank you
for hauling me out of that river.

01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:06.397
- You ought to go back and rest, Billy.
- I will, Big Casino.

01:16:07.117 --> 01:16:10.118
- First I gotta keep my promise.
- What promise?

01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:15.664
So long, Charlie, Tom!

01:16:51.203 --> 01:16:52.745
It was the Kid.

01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:55.996
He rode up smiling and talking,
and whopped me on the head.

01:17:02.006 --> 01:17:03.998
All right, cut 'em loose.

01:17:05.509 --> 01:17:08.344
And gather up some artillery.
I'm forming a posse.

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:14.260
Hey, Sheriff Brady!

01:17:37.499 --> 01:17:38.578
Damn.

01:17:40.002 --> 01:17:43.869
- The Governor is not to be disturbed.
- He'll be disturbed, all right.

01:17:43.964 --> 01:17:46.170
Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.

01:17:46.258 --> 01:17:48.085
- But, sir...
- Be quiet, will you?

01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:50.253
Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.

01:17:50.346 --> 01:17:53.014
Good God! Lawrence! What happened?

01:17:53.557 --> 01:17:57.056
Just got a telegram from Lincoln.
Get rid of that damn fool, will you?

01:17:57.144 --> 01:17:58.554
- What?
- Him!

01:17:59.021 --> 01:18:02.604
It's all right, George.
Now, what in heaven's name happened?

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.023
The Kid just killed Brady,
Morton, and Baker...

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:08.526
and escaped while Chisum and
Justice Wilson stood and watched him.

01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:09.854
I can't believe it.

01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:14.076
Sam, Brady, Morton, and Baker believe it.
Believe me, you're in the firing line.

01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:15.536
You better do something...

01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:19.535
before President Hayes decides
you can't handle this territory.

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.582
What do you suggest that I do?

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:24.041
First, Justice Wilson is Chisum's friend.

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:27.047
So revoke his powers.
You've got plenty of grounds.

01:18:29.009 --> 01:18:30.338
All right.

01:18:31.553 --> 01:18:33.048
I'll do that.

01:18:35.265 --> 01:18:36.594
What else?

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.888
You good people witnessed
the cowardly and cold-blooded murder...

01:18:42.982 --> 01:18:47.026
of our beloved Sheriff Brady
by Billy "the Kid" Bonney, right there.

01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:51.980
Governor Axtell has appointed
a new Sheriff: Dan Nodeen.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.904
He's offered a $200 reward for the Kid.

01:18:56.745 --> 01:18:59.153
And I'm adding a further reward...

01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:02.249
of $1,000, dead or alive.

01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:08.580
The Sheriff has formed his posse.

01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:13.253
Have you got anything
you want to add to that, Sheriff?

01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:15.883
Just this.

01:19:16.056 --> 01:19:18.096
I'm gonna bring Bonney in.

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:22.050
You people can either help me,
or stay the hell out of my way.

01:20:11.195 --> 01:20:13.816
John, since Governor Axtell
hung me out to dry...

01:20:13.905 --> 01:20:15.815
there's nothing I can help you with.

01:20:15.907 --> 01:20:19.241
- I'll head back to Mesilla in the morning.
- All right, J.B.

01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:22.987
I'm writing President Hayes a letter
asking for an impartial investigation...

01:20:23.082 --> 01:20:27.411
By that time, Murphy'll have his name
on everything between Arizona and Texas.

01:20:29.379 --> 01:20:30.839
Mr. Murphy...

01:20:30.923 --> 01:20:33.544
just how much of Lincoln County
are you after?

01:20:33.842 --> 01:20:36.334
Mr. Chisum came out here
several years ago...

01:20:36.428 --> 01:20:38.670
put his name on everything he could.

01:20:38.931 --> 01:20:42.134
I've only been here a little while.
Just getting started.

01:20:42.976 --> 01:20:45.514
You have anything to say to that,
Mr. Chisum?

01:20:45.854 --> 01:20:50.397
I don't favor talking to vermin,
but I'll talk to you just this once.

01:20:50.568 --> 01:20:54.019
You're not just getting started.
The line's been drawn.

01:20:54.446 --> 01:20:57.020
What Billy did balanced the books so far.

01:20:57.616 --> 01:21:01.863
But if one of your men cross my land,
or even touch one of my cows...

01:21:01.954 --> 01:21:04.195
or do anything to that store...

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:08.703
I'm not going to the Sheriff, the Governor,
or the President of the United States.

01:21:08.794 --> 01:21:10.668
I'm coming to see you.

01:21:12.214 --> 01:21:14.883
Mr. Chisum, that sounds like a threat.

01:21:17.803 --> 01:21:19.760
Wrong word: Fact.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.449
Billy, why did you come back?
All of Lincoln County's looking for you.

01:21:48.542 --> 01:21:50.036
They ain't gonna find me.

01:21:50.127 --> 01:21:52.832
Leastways till I find Murphy and Evans.

01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:54.921
You killed those men.

01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:58.758
Mr. Tunstall was the first man ever
to treat me decent.

01:21:58.844 --> 01:22:00.587
He never hurt nobody.

01:22:01.096 --> 01:22:03.717
I'm gonna get anybody
who had anything to do with it.

01:22:03.807 --> 01:22:06.096
- They'll kill you.
- They'll try.

01:22:09.104 --> 01:22:12.438
- Pat, what're you doing?
- Maybe he wants the reward.

01:22:12.566 --> 01:22:15.187
You know Pat Garrett better than that.

01:22:16.612 --> 01:22:19.068
Look, Pat, you saved my life...

01:22:19.948 --> 01:22:22.025
and I'm sorry I had to clout you.

01:22:22.117 --> 01:22:24.489
But don't go pulling a gun on me.

01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:27.529
Get Mr. Chisum, Sallie.

01:22:27.873 --> 01:22:29.498
Put it down, Pat.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.660
You two walk away.

01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:36.080
Come on in here, Billy.

01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:39.464
I know how you feel, but...

01:22:40.636 --> 01:22:42.593
you've gone about it the wrong way.

01:22:42.679 --> 01:22:47.175
- It's what you'd have done 25 years ago.
- Billy, all you've done is bollix things up.

01:22:47.267 --> 01:22:49.805
The Governor's appointed
another Murphy man sheriff.

01:22:49.895 --> 01:22:50.926
So?

01:22:51.438 --> 01:22:54.973
- You can't go around killing all the sheriffs.
- I can't?

01:22:56.652 --> 01:22:59.937
- You know how this thing's gonna end.
- It's my life.

01:23:00.781 --> 01:23:04.066
But you're affecting the lives
of a lot of other people.

01:23:04.159 --> 01:23:07.030
Are you talking about a lot of people,
or Sallie?

01:23:09.164 --> 01:23:12.699
Maybe it funnels down to her, too.
She reminds me of...

01:23:15.462 --> 01:23:17.371
There was a girl once...

01:23:17.464 --> 01:23:18.959
back in Texas.

01:23:19.341 --> 01:23:20.966
A long time ago.

01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:26.254
I knew that the best thing for me to do
was to turn my back.

01:23:26.848 --> 01:23:29.635
Let her marry a man
that'd make her happy.

01:23:31.812 --> 01:23:33.804
You're talking about Garrett now.

01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:36.852
I'm talking about a man
that could make her happy.

01:23:39.403 --> 01:23:41.692
I get your meaning, Mr. Chisum.

01:23:43.699 --> 01:23:46.024
I'm not gonna turn you in, Billy.

01:23:46.827 --> 01:23:48.866
But I'm telling you this:

01:23:49.371 --> 01:23:51.909
Don't ever show up on my land again.

01:23:59.465 --> 01:24:01.339
All right, Mr. Chisum.

01:24:02.217 --> 01:24:03.546
I'll ride.

01:24:20.569 --> 01:24:23.060
I didn't intend that you should hear that.

01:24:23.155 --> 01:24:26.405
I'm glad I did.
Helps me understand a lot of things.

01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:30.744
- Your father was a good man.
- Yes, he was.

01:24:30.871 --> 01:24:34.157
I know you did what you thought
was right for all of you...

01:24:34.249 --> 01:24:36.408
and that's what you're doing now.

01:24:36.501 --> 01:24:39.337
Maybe you should have let Mother
make her own choice.

01:24:39.421 --> 01:24:40.619
She did.

01:24:40.839 --> 01:24:42.879
She made the right choice.

01:24:48.222 --> 01:24:49.550
So will I.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.097
I know you will, Sallie.

01:24:56.855 --> 01:24:58.813
Don't lie to me, you pepper gut.

01:24:59.316 --> 01:25:02.317
But I swear to you, <i>señor,</i>
we haven't seen him.

01:25:02.403 --> 01:25:04.062
He hasn't been here at all.

01:25:04.154 --> 01:25:07.939
If he comes here, or rides by,
you get to town and tell me.

01:25:09.201 --> 01:25:12.819
'Cause if I hear he even passed this way
without you telling me about it...

01:25:12.955 --> 01:25:14.746
you're going to jail.

01:25:14.832 --> 01:25:16.207
You understand?

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:18.331
<i>Sí, Señor</i> Sheriff.

01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:42.984
Knock a lot of horseshoes loose
in them rocks...

01:25:43.068 --> 01:25:44.812
and all for nothing.

01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:47.852
That Nodeen.

01:25:47.948 --> 01:25:50.404
Sure is hell-bent on catching you, Billy.

01:25:50.492 --> 01:25:53.778
I should've killed him
when I had the chance down in Guadalupe.

01:25:53.871 --> 01:25:57.121
Murphy must want you pretty bad
to put up $1,000 for your hide.

01:25:57.374 --> 01:25:59.865
It's gonna cost him more than that.

01:26:00.002 --> 01:26:02.493
He ain't gonna get my hide.

01:26:02.588 --> 01:26:05.161
- I'm gonna get his.
- Let's get started.

01:26:05.257 --> 01:26:06.668
All right.

01:26:06.758 --> 01:26:09.925
First off, we're gonna hit Murphy's bank
and take his money.

01:26:10.929 --> 01:26:13.172
He's got a safe as big as a barn.

01:26:13.265 --> 01:26:15.388
- We'll blow it open.
- We'll need dynamite.

01:26:15.476 --> 01:26:16.851
We'll get it.

01:26:16.935 --> 01:26:18.346
We'll need some more men.

01:26:18.437 --> 01:26:19.682
How many?

01:26:19.771 --> 01:26:21.515
About half a dozen.

01:26:21.732 --> 01:26:25.681
Men who know the layout of the bank,
and can shoot their way out of town.

01:26:25.778 --> 01:26:29.194
There's Brown, Scurlock.
Middleton's all right.

01:26:29.281 --> 01:26:31.855
And while you're visiting the bank...

01:26:32.034 --> 01:26:33.907
I'll be visiting Mr. Murphy.

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:38.907
I got 500 head of prime cattle
penned up at the corral.

01:26:38.999 --> 01:26:41.870
I want you and some of the boys
to deliver 'em to Tucson.

01:26:41.961 --> 01:26:43.455
You can leave...

01:26:51.052 --> 01:26:53.046
- Did you find him?
- No.

01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:55.640
What did you come back for?

01:26:55.724 --> 01:26:58.559
Some of the horses went lame.
We'll start again tomorrow.

01:26:58.644 --> 01:27:00.553
If you needed horses,
you could've sent for 'em.

01:27:00.646 --> 01:27:02.555
Listen, Murphy, I know my job.

01:27:03.065 --> 01:27:04.939
Nobody said you don't.

01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:08.192
Every time I take a step,
I think of Bill Bonney.

01:27:08.779 --> 01:27:11.234
I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna see him dead.

01:27:11.948 --> 01:27:13.740
Yeah, sure, Sheriff.

01:27:13.992 --> 01:27:17.527
Want to come to the saloon?
I'll buy all of you a drink.

01:27:17.621 --> 01:27:20.408
I prefer my own bottle
and my own company.

01:27:30.509 --> 01:27:33.795
That man there,
he's meaner than a gut-shot grizzly.

01:27:34.096 --> 01:27:35.803
Well, that's what we need.

01:27:36.265 --> 01:27:39.515
You men got your own bottles,
or do you want to come in the saloon?

01:27:39.601 --> 01:27:42.223
Hell, you know we're going
in the saloon with you.

01:27:53.032 --> 01:27:54.111
Fifty.

01:28:09.798 --> 01:28:11.127
Whose move?

01:28:12.342 --> 01:28:13.457
His.

01:28:16.221 --> 01:28:17.929
It's turning cold.

01:28:18.015 --> 01:28:19.639
Wind's from the north.

01:28:19.725 --> 01:28:21.848
Comanches call it <i>Tahnimara.</i>

01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:23.972
Lonely wind.

01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:27.389
I wonder where you heard that.

01:28:28.984 --> 01:28:30.395
You know, Pat...

01:28:30.652 --> 01:28:33.440
there have been a lot of stories
about John Chisum.

01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:35.357
About how wild he was.

01:28:36.283 --> 01:28:38.157
Those were wild times.

01:28:38.827 --> 01:28:41.497
I think, in some ways,
the two of them are a lot alike.

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.659
Who?

01:28:43.206 --> 01:28:45.199
Uncle John, Billy Bonney.

01:28:47.086 --> 01:28:49.078
Don't you think they are?

01:28:51.382 --> 01:28:52.710
Don't you?

01:28:53.967 --> 01:28:56.090
Not in the important things.

01:28:56.178 --> 01:28:57.507
Like what?

01:28:58.388 --> 01:29:00.926
Mr. Chisum's changed with the times.

01:29:01.475 --> 01:29:04.180
He doesn't like to let on, but he cares.

01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:07.522
About the people here and in town.

01:29:08.524 --> 01:29:11.062
About the Indians and the territory.

01:29:12.486 --> 01:29:13.897
He's independent...

01:29:13.987 --> 01:29:16.692
and he likes to do things his own way,
but he cares.

01:29:16.782 --> 01:29:18.406
And Billy doesn't?

01:29:19.785 --> 01:29:21.908
I guess he can't help it.

01:29:22.871 --> 01:29:26.038
But you heard him,
all he cares about is getting those men.

01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:28.413
In a way, doesn't it amount
to the same thing?

01:29:28.502 --> 01:29:29.533
No.

01:29:29.795 --> 01:29:32.796
Billy wants revenge.
Mr. Chisum wants justice.

01:29:32.882 --> 01:29:34.541
There's a big difference.

01:29:37.135 --> 01:29:40.220
And there's a big difference
between love and infatuation.

01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:44.264
What about Pat Garrett?

01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:50.601
Pat Garrett hasn't talked so much
since Sunday School recitation.

01:29:51.734 --> 01:29:53.525
I better get you in.

01:30:26.727 --> 01:30:27.925
Johnny!

01:30:29.313 --> 01:30:33.061
The rest of you take the horses
around the side, and leave ours here.

01:30:46.371 --> 01:30:47.782
Who's there?

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.865
Who is it? Who's down there?

01:30:54.422 --> 01:30:56.248
It's me, Mr. McSween.

01:30:56.882 --> 01:30:58.045
Billy?

01:30:59.217 --> 01:31:02.005
What are you doing now,
stealing from your friends?

01:31:02.095 --> 01:31:03.887
No, sir. Not exactly.

01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:06.970
We just need the loan of a little dynamite.

01:31:07.059 --> 01:31:08.802
- Dynamite?
- Yeah.

01:31:09.645 --> 01:31:12.480
- Don't you think you've done enough?
- No, sir.

01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:14.642
But I'm going to.

01:31:30.999 --> 01:31:32.197
Bonney.

01:31:33.168 --> 01:31:34.579
Billy, listen to me.

01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:38.418
I've written a letter to the President.
There will be an investigation.

01:31:38.507 --> 01:31:40.832
This whole thing is a travesty.
I promise you...

01:31:40.926 --> 01:31:44.876
I don't know what travesty means,
but I made a promise, too.

01:31:51.478 --> 01:31:52.641
Evans.

01:31:54.273 --> 01:31:56.265
- What do you want?
- Get up!

01:31:56.358 --> 01:31:57.936
Come on, get up!

01:31:59.612 --> 01:32:02.981
Alex, is everything all right? I heard...
Billy.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.154
Honey, everything is all right.
You go on back upstairs.

01:32:07.244 --> 01:32:10.280
It's okay, ma'am.
We just need some supplies.

01:32:11.248 --> 01:32:12.493
At this hour?

01:32:12.583 --> 01:32:14.409
Sue, go back upstairs.

01:32:22.092 --> 01:32:23.421
Get inside!

01:32:36.899 --> 01:32:38.690
There's a mess of 'em out there.

01:32:38.775 --> 01:32:41.860
Hold your fire!

01:32:46.616 --> 01:32:48.111
Bonney, can you hear me?

01:32:48.243 --> 01:32:49.737
Sheriff Nodeen!

01:32:49.828 --> 01:32:51.655
Good morning, Sheriff!

01:32:51.747 --> 01:32:54.154
No, it ain't, Bonney. Not for you.

01:32:54.833 --> 01:32:56.625
There are 100 guns out here.

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.628
Hey, Nodeen,
the McSweens have got no part of this.

01:33:00.839 --> 01:33:03.793
They ain't done nothing,
so let 'em come out!

01:33:04.259 --> 01:33:07.296
Anybody that comes out of there
while it's still dark...

01:33:07.388 --> 01:33:09.048
gets cut in half!

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.095
You ain't got no place to go, Bonney.

01:33:12.184 --> 01:33:13.927
What do we do, Billy?

01:33:14.019 --> 01:33:17.602
Pile something up against the windows.
Nothing else we can do right now.

01:33:17.773 --> 01:33:20.346
Nothing's gonna happen till daylight.

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.617
Bonney!

01:33:41.255 --> 01:33:43.046
Sheriff Nodeen again!

01:33:43.632 --> 01:33:45.007
Time's up!

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.041
He's mad.

01:33:48.178 --> 01:33:50.171
Must not have had any breakfast.

01:33:50.263 --> 01:33:53.099
You know what's gonna happen to you
if you don't surrender!

01:33:53.183 --> 01:33:55.175
I know what'll happen if I do!

01:33:55.269 --> 01:33:57.676
I'll get a bullet in the back
trying to escape!

01:33:57.771 --> 01:34:00.558
Here's what you're gonna get
if you stay in there!

01:34:19.877 --> 01:34:22.083
Damn place is built like a fort.

01:34:22.171 --> 01:34:24.044
What'll it be, Bonney?

01:34:27.259 --> 01:34:30.047
Billy, we've got to get Sue out of here.

01:34:33.515 --> 01:34:35.841
Sheriff, this is McSween.

01:34:38.854 --> 01:34:40.977
Is Lawrence Murphy out there?

01:34:41.899 --> 01:34:43.179
I'm here.

01:34:44.777 --> 01:34:47.065
Lawrence, let my wife come out.

01:34:47.571 --> 01:34:51.236
Then we can talk.
I give you my word, there'll be no tricks.

01:34:53.202 --> 01:34:54.779
All right, Alex.

01:34:55.245 --> 01:34:56.905
She can come out.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.578
It'll look better this way, Sheriff.

01:35:00.918 --> 01:35:03.539
We don't want any women getting killed.

01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:04.909
No, Alex.

01:35:05.297 --> 01:35:07.254
Not unless you come, too.

01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:10.544
I want to speak on behalf of these men,
then I'll be right out.

01:35:10.635 --> 01:35:12.675
You go on ahead, Sue.

01:35:14.556 --> 01:35:16.679
All right, she's coming out!

01:35:52.094 --> 01:35:53.339
Lawrence?

01:35:54.262 --> 01:35:58.474
Will you send word to Fort Stanton
and let these men surrender to the Army?

01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:00.475
Look, Mr. McSween...

01:36:00.644 --> 01:36:02.387
you're not talking for us.

01:36:02.479 --> 01:36:04.471
I'm trying to help you...

01:36:04.648 --> 01:36:06.308
to keep you alive.

01:36:06.483 --> 01:36:08.891
The Army has no jurisdiction here.

01:36:09.069 --> 01:36:11.062
This is a civil matter...

01:36:11.154 --> 01:36:13.824
and if anyone surrenders, it's to me.

01:36:14.616 --> 01:36:16.027
Better get out of here...

01:36:16.118 --> 01:36:18.360
'cause I ain't ever gonna surrender
to Nodeen.

01:36:18.495 --> 01:36:20.987
- Billy!
- Go out there with your wife.

01:36:26.504 --> 01:36:27.784
Sheriff...

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.453
I'm unarmed, and I'm coming out alone!

01:36:30.549 --> 01:36:32.625
No, you ain't! Not alone.

01:36:33.552 --> 01:36:35.924
Not till everybody
throws down their guns...

01:36:36.012 --> 01:36:38.052
and you all come out together...

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.429
with Bonney in the lead!
Them's my terms.

01:36:40.517 --> 01:36:42.640
Sheriff, my husband's done nothing wrong.

01:36:42.728 --> 01:36:45.184
Your husband is harboring a killer.

01:36:45.314 --> 01:36:48.848
- Mr. Murphy...
- I'm sorry. I can't interfere with the law.

01:36:54.948 --> 01:36:58.282
- What about it, Bonney?
- I'm not coming out, Nodeen.

01:37:10.547 --> 01:37:13.548
- Please!
- Get out of here before you get hurt.

01:37:39.576 --> 01:37:41.699
Mr. McSween, it's your wife.

01:37:44.123 --> 01:37:46.080
She's going for Chisum!

01:37:48.419 --> 01:37:50.826
Exactly, we'll fight him
on our own ground.

01:37:50.921 --> 01:37:53.756
Get some men by the river
in case they come in that way...

01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:56.592
and throw a barricade across that street.

01:38:07.438 --> 01:38:09.561
We're running short of lead.

01:38:09.648 --> 01:38:11.023
Mr. McSween.

01:38:12.943 --> 01:38:14.272
All right.

01:38:15.612 --> 01:38:17.652
Here's the key to the room.

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:21.113
Upstairs!

01:38:25.748 --> 01:38:27.787
Women and children off the street!

01:38:31.587 --> 01:38:32.749
Hold it!

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.881
- Damn it! Where are you going?
- Going to warn the noon stage.

01:38:36.008 --> 01:38:37.550
Noon stage, my...

01:38:53.984 --> 01:38:56.819
There's enough ammunition there
to fight a war.

01:38:57.029 --> 01:38:58.986
That's what we're doing.

01:38:59.656 --> 01:39:00.985
Mr. Chisum!

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.678
You have to get Alex.
They're gonna kill him.

01:39:23.764 --> 01:39:26.337
Murphy and Nodeen's men
have the store surrounded.

01:39:26.433 --> 01:39:28.057
Billy's in there.

01:39:28.352 --> 01:39:30.677
- Please, Mr. Chisum.
- Take care of her, Sallie.

01:39:30.771 --> 01:39:33.558
- What're you gonna do?
- What I'd have done 25 years ago.

01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:35.476
Pat, get the men out of South Camp.

01:39:35.567 --> 01:39:38.936
Trace, you round up everybody
that can ride a horse or pull a trigger.

01:39:39.029 --> 01:39:41.900
- Let's break out some Winchesters.
- You bet.

01:40:22.406 --> 01:40:24.066
Come on, hurry up.

01:40:31.415 --> 01:40:32.874
It's my arm.

01:40:38.047 --> 01:40:39.589
Give up, Billy.

01:40:55.689 --> 01:40:57.598
We're ready for him now.

01:41:02.571 --> 01:41:05.406
Billy, they've got the street blocked off!

01:41:05.949 --> 01:41:07.609
It ain't to keep us in.

01:41:07.701 --> 01:41:10.192
- It's to keep somebody out.
- Chisum.

01:41:18.712 --> 01:41:20.206
We'll be slaughtered.

01:41:20.297 --> 01:41:24.544
- I'm going out there and talk to Murphy.
- No! Don't do it, Mr. McSween!

01:41:24.635 --> 01:41:26.177
Don't go out there!

01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:28.301
Sheriff, Murphy...

01:41:28.889 --> 01:41:30.466
hold your fire!

01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:33.890
I've got to talk to you...

01:41:34.103 --> 01:41:35.976
and I'm coming out alone.

01:41:36.063 --> 01:41:37.771
Don't, Mr. McSween!

01:41:38.315 --> 01:41:40.107
You heard my terms!

01:42:13.267 --> 01:42:14.891
Get some torches!

01:42:15.519 --> 01:42:17.476
I'll burn the son of a bitch out.

01:42:29.741 --> 01:42:32.363
<i>Señor</i> Chisum, they built a barricade.

01:42:32.786 --> 01:42:34.945
We could go around
and come in from behind.

01:42:35.039 --> 01:42:38.288
We'd have to cross that river.
We'd be sitting ducks.

01:42:39.168 --> 01:42:41.493
Then what do we do, Mr. Chisum?

01:42:42.379 --> 01:42:46.163
We do exactly what we started out to do,
Mr. Pepper.

01:43:49.529 --> 01:43:50.941
It's Chisum!

01:43:53.533 --> 01:43:55.360
Let's pour it in him.

01:44:03.293 --> 01:44:04.953
To hell with this.

01:44:48.506 --> 01:44:51.590
You wanted him on your own ground.
You got him.

01:46:03.956 --> 01:46:06.447
- Good to see you, Big Casino.
- Yeah.

01:46:22.015 --> 01:46:23.557
Cover me, Pat.

01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:36.733
Billy.

01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:52.119
Ain't like old times...

01:46:53.631 --> 01:46:54.828
Billy.

01:47:50.938 --> 01:47:52.396
Can you make it?

01:47:52.523 --> 01:47:54.349
What? Where's...

01:48:00.405 --> 01:48:02.197
Where are you going?

01:48:02.699 --> 01:48:03.980
I resign.

01:48:04.159 --> 01:48:06.282
No more paydays around here.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.958
I know.

01:48:23.053 --> 01:48:24.547
It's my fault.

01:48:25.222 --> 01:48:27.677
You were the primer, Billy...

01:48:28.392 --> 01:48:31.595
but I guess, sooner or later,
the lid had to blow off.

01:48:32.062 --> 01:48:33.770
Sheriff left town.

01:48:35.316 --> 01:48:37.438
He won't be hard to follow.

01:48:38.903 --> 01:48:41.607
- So long, Mr. Chisum.
- Let it go, Billy.

01:48:42.906 --> 01:48:44.733
That smell of death.

01:48:45.408 --> 01:48:46.737
Remember?

01:48:47.077 --> 01:48:49.117
Be seeing you, Big Casino.

01:48:55.753 --> 01:48:57.246
Are you coming?

01:49:15.063 --> 01:49:19.310
"General Lew Wallace takes oath
as new governor of territory.

01:49:20.194 --> 01:49:23.278
"Garrett appointed
Sheriff of Lincoln County.

01:49:24.406 --> 01:49:26.482
"Governor declares A-M..."

01:49:27.617 --> 01:49:28.863
Amnesty.

01:49:29.119 --> 01:49:30.282
Yeah.

01:49:30.954 --> 01:49:32.947
Do that mean the war is over?

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.997
- It do.
- I hope so.

01:49:35.834 --> 01:49:39.666
I wouldn't be too sure.
There's an old saying, Miss Sallie:

01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:43.831
"There's no law west of Dodge,
and no God west of the Pecos."

01:49:44.968 --> 01:49:46.297
Right, Mr. Chisum?

01:49:46.386 --> 01:49:48.130
Wrong, Mr. Pepper.

01:49:48.263 --> 01:49:52.391
'Cause no matter where people go,
sooner or later, there's the law.

01:49:52.642 --> 01:49:56.391
And, sooner or later,
they find that God's already been there.

01:50:01.527 --> 01:50:03.270
Now, where's he going?

01:50:03.362 --> 01:50:05.485
Don't worry. He'll be back.

01:50:05.864 --> 01:50:08.948
I better get going.
Got some things in Lincoln to take care of.

01:50:09.034 --> 01:50:12.284
Lincoln can take care of itself
until after the dishes are done.

01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:16.321
- Doesn't this badge give me any authority?
- Not in this house.
