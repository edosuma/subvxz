13:17.697 --> 13:20.431
I don't remember any reckless
driving.

13:24.403 --> 13:27.839
Right.
Well, i think i just won't pay
the fines and wait for this to

13:27.841 --> 13:30.008
all blow over.
Bye!
>> Anais: Whoa, whoa, whoa,

13:30.010 --> 13:32.544
whoa, whoa.
If you don't pay, they could
send you to jail.

13:32.546 --> 13:36.447
>> Dad: That's exactly what he
said, but don't worry.
I've been in prison heaps of

13:36.449 --> 13:39.184
times.
They put you in, then, straight
away, you're just not in there

13:39.186 --> 13:43.188
anymore.
>> Mom: This bill is $800,000.
It says if we don't pay by

13:43.190 --> 13:46.891
tomorrow, then they can take our
house away.
What is going on today?

13:46.893 --> 13:50.461
>> Anais: It seems the results
of all our reckless actions are
finally catching up with us.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.464
>> Both: We should do something!
>> Anais: You're right!
But this time, instead of diving

13:53.466 --> 13:57.468
headfirst into whatever stupid
idea, we should --
and...They're gone.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.405
>> Gumball: [ Panting ]
So, the plan is we have to do
all the schoolwork we haven't

14:00.407 --> 14:03.374
done in one shot.
>> Dad: Yeah, but first we need
to get the money for that greedy

14:03.376 --> 14:06.244
troll woman.
>> Darwin: But how do we do all
of this in one day?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.546
>> Dad: We need transportation.

14:09.648 --> 14:14.152
Stop the bus!
>> Aaah!
[ Tires screech ]

14:14.154 --> 14:19.157
[ Thud ]
[ Grunts ]
That's my bus!

14:19.159 --> 14:25.730
[ Tires squeal ]
[ Screaming ]
>> I'm sorry, Mrs. watterson,

14:25.732 --> 14:29.434
but this is the justice
department, not the "I'm sure
everything will be okay if we

14:29.436 --> 14:33.137
just sweep it under the carpet
and forget about it" department.
You're gonna have to pay the

14:33.139 --> 14:35.406
money.
>> Mom: This is ridiculous!
You can't take our house!

14:35.408 --> 14:37.909
We're nice people.
>> Interesting you should think
so.

14:37.911 --> 14:42.847
Maybe we should consult your
files.
[ Crank! Crank! Crank! Crank! ]

14:42.849 --> 14:44.983
[ Thud! ]
>> Mom: Oh --
>> that's January.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.752
[ Crank! Crank! Crank! Crank! ]
>> Dad: Okay, okay, fine.
You're right.

14:47.754 --> 14:51.189
The front door wasn't wide
enough for a bus, but --
>> you!

14:51.191 --> 14:54.993
I should have known when i saw a
bus driving into my living room
that a watterson would be at the

14:54.995 --> 14:58.096
wheel!
>> Dad: Stand back!
I've got a weapon, too.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.731
[ Whip! ]
Uh...
[ Whip! ]

14:59.733 --> 15:01.900
[ Grunts ]
>> [ Gasps ]
>> Gumball: Dad, what are you

15:01.902 --> 15:09.574
doing?!
>> Dad fight!
>> [ Chanting "dad fight" ]

15:09.576 --> 15:12.510
>> This has escalated a little
too far.
Do you really want to have a

15:12.512 --> 15:15.346
fight?
>> Dad: [ Sighs ]
[ Creak! ]

15:15.348 --> 15:21.319
[ Grunting ]
[ Gags ]
Definitely not.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.789
>> Look, just pretend to hit me
with the handle, and I'll go
down.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.425
>> Dad: Good plan.
>> On three.
One, two --

15:27.427 --> 15:31.162
[ smack! ]
Ugh!
[ Crowd groans ]

15:31.164 --> 15:34.198
>> Dad: Good acting.
>> [ Gurgles ]
>> December 24th -- car

15:34.200 --> 15:38.369
collision with Santa claus.
February 5th -- willful
destruction of a mobility

15:38.371 --> 15:40.305
scooter.
April 2nd --
[ Cellphone rings ]

15:40.307 --> 15:44.642
Oh.
Oh, i see. Thanks.
>> Mom: Uh, sorry -- what are

15:44.644 --> 15:47.478
you doing?
>> Apparently, your husband
crashed a hijacked bus into a

15:47.480 --> 15:51.950
house and assaulted a man with a
rake.
>> Mom: [ Groaning ]

15:51.952 --> 15:57.155
[ Chuckling ] Oh, you.
>> Mm-hmm.
Assault on a municipal officer.

15:57.157 --> 16:01.526
>> Mom: Oh, come on! Please!
You have to help us!
Isn't there something we can do

16:01.528 --> 16:05.530
to fix this?
>> Well...I suppose you could go
and apologize to everyone on

16:05.532 --> 16:09.067
this list to get them to drop
the charges and forget about the
millions of dollars you owe

16:09.069 --> 16:12.203
them.
>> Mom: Great!
>> [ Sighs ]

16:12.205 --> 16:15.974
The problem with having a
sarcastic voice is that no one
can tell when you're actually

16:15.976 --> 16:19.644
being sarcastic.
>> Gumball: Okay, we got off to
a shaky start, but if we just

16:19.646 --> 16:22.780
pull together and stick to this
new plan, I'm sure things are
gonna go our way.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.984
>> Darwin: So, to recap --
gumball and i will sneak into
the hospital and give each other

16:25.986 --> 16:29.921
facial reconstructive surgery to
make us look like the two
highest achievers at school --

16:29.923 --> 16:32.290
bobert and Alan.
>> Gumball: Meanwhile, dad will
pose as

16:32.292 --> 16:34.559
dame prunella big-red-bus.
>> Dad: [ British accent ] Fish
and chips.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.895
>> Gumball: And he'll convince
Alan and bobert's parents to pay
him the entrance fee for a

16:37.897 --> 16:42.166
made-up British boarding school
called something really English
like, uh...Scotland,

16:42.168 --> 16:45.003
simultaneously paying off our
debts and allowing us to replace
them at school.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.372
>> Dad: Ah! Perfect and simple.
What could go wrong?

16:47.573 --> 16:54.479
[ Birds chirping ]
[ All panting ]
[ Sirens wailing ]

16:54.481 --> 16:58.182
>> Mom: Come on, Larry.
Just let me in!
I'm sure we can talk this

16:58.184 --> 17:00.351
through.
>> No!
Every time i so much as look at

17:00.353 --> 17:02.754
a watterson, something terrible
happens.
[ Clattering ]

17:02.756 --> 17:06.057
Okay, i take that back.
Seems just talking to a
watterson's enough.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.927
>> Anais: But don't you think a
class-action lawsuit is a slight
overreaction for repeatedly

17:09.929 --> 17:13.765
scaring off your fiancée?
>> Every time you guys mess
something up, i have to pay for

17:13.767 --> 17:17.201
it out of my own wages.
Why else do you think i have so
many jobs?

17:17.203 --> 17:20.371
>> Anais: Hmm.
Never thought about that before.
>> Mom: Look, I'm tired of your

17:20.373 --> 17:23.408
attitude, mister.
I'm coming in there, and we're
going to shake hands and make up

17:23.410 --> 17:25.610
like adults.
>> Anais: Mom, you can't do
that!

17:25.612 --> 17:28.246
>> Mom: Yes...
[ Deep voice ] I can!
>> Anais: No!

17:28.248 --> 17:31.282
I mean, you can't do that
because he's got a...
[ Sighs ]

17:31.284 --> 17:32.750
...restraining order on us.

17:35.687 --> 17:39.824
>> Dad: Now, what you do when
you arrive in prison is you
punch the biggest guy in the

17:39.826 --> 17:41.793
room.
Then, no one will --
ow!

17:41.795 --> 17:44.495
>> Gumball: He said punch the
biggest, not the fattest.
>> Darwin: Sorry.

17:44.497 --> 17:49.200
>> Dad: Now it hurts here<i> and</i>
here.
[ Door opens ]

17:49.202 --> 17:52.370
>> Dad: Ah! Thank goodness!
Your mother's here to bail us
out!

17:52.372 --> 17:54.906
>> Anais: [ Sighs ]
Not this time.
>> Gumball: What?!

17:54.908 --> 17:58.843
You're in here, too?!
Hold on. That's all right.
I'm sure some unforeseen detail

17:58.845 --> 18:03.681
that usually gets us off the
hook is gonna pop up right...
Now.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.051
>> Wattersons, you're free.
>> Together: Yes!
>> To remain silent.

18:07.053 --> 18:11.489
Otherwise, no dinner tonight.
[ Slam! ]
>> Gumball: [ Crying ] Where's

18:11.491 --> 18:16.761
my happy ending?
>> Anais: This is the end, guys.
Show's over.

18:25.904 --> 18:29.107
>> Gumball: No.
>> Dad: What?
>> Gumball: I said no!

18:29.109 --> 18:34.078
It doesn't end like this -- not
on my watch!
They say we've gone too far, but

18:34.080 --> 18:37.849
i say we haven't gone far
enough!
We're busting out of here.

18:37.851 --> 18:42.920
Hey, punk, my dad said that if
his dog was as ugly as you, he'd
shave its butt and teach it to

18:42.922 --> 18:47.158
walk backwards!
>> Dad: [ Chuckles ]
[ Smash! ]

18:47.160 --> 18:51.762
[ Pop! ]
>> Together: Dad!
>> Mom: Oh, thank you.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.798
Thank you.
This is for breaking us out of
here.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.867
[ Smooches ]
And this is for punching my
husband.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.703
[ Crack! ]
>> Aah!
>> Mom: Okay. What now?

18:58.705 --> 19:01.806
>> Anais: I think gumball was
on to something.
Up until now, every bad

19:01.808 --> 19:05.409
situation has gotten worse and
worse until it somehow just
fixed itself.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.447
There's only one solution left.
>> Dad: [ Muffled ] What is it?
>> Anais: Everyone take a

19:09.449 --> 19:13.084
problem, part ways, and produce
a problem more problematic than
a problem of that proportion

19:13.086 --> 19:15.753
should probably be.
>> Together: Huh?
>> Anais: Just do what you do

19:15.755 --> 19:21.425
best -- make things worse.
>> Gumball: It says here that
Mr. small is suing us for giving

19:21.427 --> 19:25.530
him claustrophobia that time we
got him stuck in a filing
cabinet.

19:25.532 --> 19:29.233
>> Oh, I'm sorry, but i don't
see any kind of surprise for me
inside this en--

19:29.235 --> 19:33.204
[ muffled screaming ]
>> Gumball: Sorry.
Sorry, Mr. small.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.974
>> Darwin: Do you think we made
things bad enough?
>> [ Muffled screaming ]

19:36.976 --> 19:41.712
>> Gumball: There.
Now let's go and post him to the
smallest country in the world.

19:41.714 --> 19:47.018
[ Whap! ]
>> Dad: [ Gasps ]
Kenneth -- the gross jar

19:47.020 --> 19:52.156
creature.
Are you sure this is a good
idea?

19:52.158 --> 19:56.060
>> [ Roars ]
>> Anais: Yep.
This is exactly what we need.

20:01.266 --> 20:05.870
[ Shink! ]
>> Hi, Mrs. watterson.
Did you come to give us the

20:05.872 --> 20:10.341
money you owe us?
>> Mom: Uh, no.
I just need you to give your mom

20:10.343 --> 20:14.979
a message.
Tell your mom that she's so
short, she needs shoes for her

20:14.981 --> 20:19.083
chin.
>> [ Growls ]
>> Mom: Uh, also, tell your mom

20:19.085 --> 20:22.153
she's so fat that her
high-school photo was a
double-page spread.

20:22.155 --> 20:28.392
>> [ Growls ]
>> Mom: And finally, tell your
mom that she has so many warts

20:28.394 --> 20:32.096
that her face spells "ugly" in
braille.
[ Rumbling ]

20:32.098 --> 20:34.899
>> [ Roaring ]
>> Aah!
[ Cellphone dialing ]

20:34.901 --> 20:40.638
>> Mom: Okay.
The plan worked pretty well.
How are you guys doing?

20:40.640 --> 20:46.110
Is Kenneth in good spirits?
>> Dad: Yep.
It's pretty bad.

20:46.112 --> 20:51.148
[ Screaming ]
He's eaten everyone on the bus
and the bus.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.986
Aah!
[ All gasp ]

20:58.056 --> 21:00.524
[ Both roaring ]

21:03.262 --> 21:05.196
>> Dad: How do we get out of
here?
>> Gumball: [ Whistles ]

21:05.198 --> 21:06.530
Quick, jump on!

21:10.736 --> 21:14.338
>> Hey!
Come back with my scooter before
i forget why I'm running after

21:14.340 --> 21:18.709
you!
>> Dad: [ Gasps ]
Well, i think we've pretty much

21:18.711 --> 21:22.880
ticked off the whole town.
>> They dropped our baby!
>> They blew up my head!

21:22.882 --> 21:24.749
>> They ran me over!
[ Pounding on door ]
[ Crash! ]

21:24.751 --> 21:28.686
>> Dad: [ Gasps ]
>> Darwin: What do we do now?
>> Gumball: Mom, they're getting

21:28.688 --> 21:32.490
in!
[ Indistinct shouting ]
>> Dad: Somebody think of

21:32.492 --> 21:35.726
something.
I can't hold them off forever.
>> Mom: No! This is it!

21:35.728 --> 21:39.797
It's all over!
The end of the wattersons!
>> Gumball: The only thing that

21:39.799 --> 21:43.534
can save us is reality being
completely reset by some kind of
magic device!
