00:04.437 --> 00:07.315
STELLA: So how many
rooms do you have here?
ARCHIE: Oh, er, 67.

00:07.399 --> 00:11.360
STELLA: 67 rooms to heat,
light and maintain?
No wonder you're broke.

00:11.443 --> 00:15.822
Never needed to. Believe me,
Stella, we've already cut our
overheads to the bone.

00:15.905 --> 00:19.617
If you can find one example
of inefficiency, I will be the
first to swing the hatchet.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.701
HECTOR: Fore!

00:23.912 --> 00:26.123
(UPBEAT
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.416 --> 00:30.376
Ah, morning.

00:30.459 --> 00:33.461
Er, driving through the
French windows does wonders
for one's accuracy.

00:33.545 --> 00:36.339
Providing you remember
to open them, of course.

00:36.423 --> 00:38.299
Fore!

00:39.883 --> 00:42.469
How do you get the balls back?

00:42.553 --> 00:46.180
Well, I've tried training
the dogs, but they're hopeless
at holding their breath.

00:46.264 --> 00:50.059
No, a rather nice chap from
Paisley sends me a fresh
supply every week.

00:50.143 --> 00:52.102
Fore!

00:57.773 --> 01:00.651
(SOFT
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:03.361 --> 01:06.281
-So this is your studio?
-Oh, hardly.

01:06.364 --> 01:09.700
-Just a wee place
where I can dabble.
-It's so wonderfully bright.

01:09.783 --> 01:12.953
Oh! And warm.

01:13.036 --> 01:15.122
Don't you find
the view inspiring?

01:15.205 --> 01:19.417
Oh, yes, I'm getting
this lovely vivid picture
in my mind.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.173
I think it's time
for that hatchet.

02:05.246 --> 02:08.375
So how do you
budget for food exactly?

02:09.375 --> 02:11.501
We work to a set routine.

02:11.585 --> 02:15.838
A big breakfast, a light lunch
and no more than eight
courses at dinner time.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.259
Eight courses?

02:20.343 --> 02:24.346
Seven. That's if
they're feeling informal.

02:27.473 --> 02:29.850
-And we do use a lot
of our own produce.
-Oh, aye.

02:29.934 --> 02:32.353
We, we grow our own veg
and we catch our own fish.

02:32.436 --> 02:35.647
Vintage Burgundy, two cases.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.650
Pity you don't
tread your own grapes.
Oh, biscuits from Harrods.

02:39.733 --> 02:43.195
-Well,
a few luxuries never hurt.
-Half a hundredweight a week.

02:43.278 --> 02:45.571
Actually, they're for
the dogs.

02:45.655 --> 02:47.198
Well, they are working
animals.

02:47.281 --> 02:49.409
-They do earn their keep.
-How, exactly?

02:51.493 --> 02:54.413
Um, well, they hunt.

02:54.496 --> 02:56.498
(DOGS BARKING)

02:58.416 --> 03:04.003
Oh, yes. They've just
hunted down my Filofax.

03:05.755 --> 03:07.298
You must be so proud.

03:10.926 --> 03:13.387
Stella will be giving
her pep talk shortly.

03:13.470 --> 03:16.055
I don't think she
was too impressed
by my bookkeeping.

03:16.139 --> 03:18.725
Oh, forget it. I'm the laird,
I'll take the rap.

03:18.808 --> 03:20.393
It won't be so bad anyway.

03:20.476 --> 03:23.186
Though she might make Father
dive for his golf balls.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.021
I'd pay good money
to see that.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.398
Well, there you are,we're
in profit already.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.404
Who painted this?

03:34.487 --> 03:37.157
Oh, just some
nine-year-old delinquent.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.994
"Alexandra." Oh, that
nine-year-old delinquent.

03:42.077 --> 03:46.122
-I thought it was
a picture of Glenbogle.
-Well, it is, sort of.

03:46.205 --> 03:49.459
I used to dream
about being a princess
and living in a big castle.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.336
Suppose I'm halfway there.

03:53.420 --> 03:57.007
-You'll always be
my princess, Lexie.
-Cinderella, you mean.

03:58.758 --> 04:01.886
So who was Katrina?
The ugly sister?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.138
Best not keep Stella waiting.

04:07.349 --> 04:09.433
His mistress's voice.

04:12.811 --> 04:15.646
-Stella.
-This stupid thing is jammed.

04:15.730 --> 04:18.232
These chairs are only
held together with cobwebs.

04:18.315 --> 04:19.567
STELLA: Oh!

04:19.649 --> 04:22.486
Is this what they mean
by hands-on management?

04:26.990 --> 04:32.953
Estate income over
the last 12 months, Â£42,000.

04:34.871 --> 04:39.249
Expenditure over
the same period,

04:39.333 --> 04:43.796
Â£137,000.

04:43.879 --> 04:45.797
Anyone here good at maths?

04:45.880 --> 04:48.049
No, I thought not.

04:48.132 --> 04:52.678
And here we have
outgoings broken down
by percentage.

04:52.761 --> 04:56.014
This big cheese is heating.

04:56.098 --> 04:58.848
This big cheese is catering.

04:58.933 --> 05:02.978
And this one, oh,
yes, biscuits from Harrods.

05:03.062 --> 05:05.188
Cheese and biscuits?
What's she talking about?

05:05.271 --> 05:08.358
And this is the projection
from the next quarter.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.318
Note the income. Zero.

05:15.697 --> 05:18.616
It'll take three months
to rebuild the bridge.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.993
During that time,
Glenbogle will be
run on a shoestring.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.829
These are my proposals.

05:23.912 --> 05:27.373
First, nonessential
rooms will be closed off.

05:27.456 --> 05:32.628
Most households in this
country get by with two living
rooms, now it's your turn.

05:32.712 --> 05:37.507
Second,
strict control of outlay
on groceries and petrol.

05:37.590 --> 05:42.261
Anything that
needs to be bought,
I sign the cheque.

05:42.344 --> 05:44.972
Third, the dogs have to go.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.597
Go? Go where?

05:46.681 --> 05:50.184
When you say proposals,
I take it these are
open for discussion.

05:50.268 --> 05:53.395
Did I say proposals?
I meant decisions.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.230
Staff pay and conditions
will be reviewed separately.

05:57.314 --> 05:58.649
Any questions?

06:05.905 --> 06:08.783
You're not
seriously suggesting
we get rid of the dogs?

06:08.867 --> 06:10.909
Well,
they're a drain on resources.

06:10.993 --> 06:14.955
They live here rent free and
they consume their own weight
in food every week.

06:15.038 --> 06:18.958
Yeah, well so do Golly,
Lexie and Duncan.
We're not getting rid of them.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.251
(SIGHING) Actually,
I was coming to that.

06:21.335 --> 06:25.922
Archie, I know how
fond you are of the staff
and how loyal they've been.

06:26.006 --> 06:27.423
-But...
-But what?

06:27.506 --> 06:29.216
Well,
I have to explain to my bank

06:29.300 --> 06:32.303
why we're paying
for your family
to be waited on hand and foot.

06:32.386 --> 06:33.595
You think that's all
the staff do?

06:33.678 --> 06:35.847
It really doesn't matter
what they do,

06:35.930 --> 06:38.808
we can't afford to have them
do it. We'll just have
to let them go.

06:38.892 --> 06:40.351
No way.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.102
We'll keep their jobs open
till the bridge is repaired.

06:42.186 --> 06:43.854
Forget it. Absolutely not.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.980
You said you were
going to help me
manage this place.

06:46.064 --> 06:48.941
Yeah, and I will, as long
as it doesn't involve
sacking the workforce.

06:49.025 --> 06:51.610
Archie, either they
go or Glenbogle does.

06:51.693 --> 06:53.820
I'm sorry,
I wish there was another way.

06:55.405 --> 06:56.573
Hold on.

06:58.866 --> 07:00.951
Just wait a minute.

07:01.035 --> 07:03.912
-She wanted to fire us?
-I told her to forget it.
It's not gonna happen.

07:03.995 --> 07:05.872
Good on you, Arch.

07:05.955 --> 07:09.541
-So what did she say?
-Ah, well,
this was the clever bit.

07:09.625 --> 07:13.003
I had to seize the initiative,
come back with
a counterproposal.

07:14.797 --> 07:17.548
-Go on.
-Nobody gets fired.

07:17.632 --> 07:22.427
What we do is adjust the
salary levels, on a temporary
basis, over three months.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.221
Ah, right.

07:24.304 --> 07:27.473
-Sounds good.
-He means a pay cut, Duncan.

07:27.556 --> 07:30.142
-Oh, I know it
sounds like that, but...
-How much?

07:30.226 --> 07:33.561
Well,
taking into account cash flow
and ongoing overheads and...

07:33.645 --> 07:35.397
How much, Archie?

07:37.816 --> 07:39.024
Fifty percent.

07:41.944 --> 07:44.946
-Did I miss the clever bit?
-GOLLY: Fifty percent?

07:45.029 --> 07:48.324
Well, I take it you're not
bothered about wee things like
the minimum wage, then?

07:48.408 --> 07:51.076
Well,
no, accommodation would, er,
count towards that.

07:51.159 --> 07:53.495
You'd only be paying
for food and bills.

07:53.578 --> 07:57.540
-You're charging
us for our food?
-Only till Glenbogle reopens.

07:57.623 --> 07:59.792
Stella has to sell
something to the bank.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.128
-So you're selling us.
-It's not like that.

08:02.211 --> 08:05.797
What happened to,
"I'm the Laird,
I'll take the rap"?

08:05.880 --> 08:08.800
We stood by you when Stella
was gonna dump you.

08:08.883 --> 08:11.802
-This is how you repay us?
-We're all in this together.

08:11.885 --> 08:16.139
Are we? So why not ask us
how the estate can save money?

08:16.222 --> 08:19.142
-Or does what we
have to say not count?
-Of course it does, but...

08:19.225 --> 08:21.727
But not as much as
what whatshername says.

08:21.810 --> 08:27.023
-Oh, for Pete's sake.
-Well,
you can shove your pay cut.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.734
Lexie, it's either
that or we fire everyone.

08:29.817 --> 08:32.611
We?
Whose side are you on, Arch?

08:35.238 --> 08:39.158
Fine. Until you've
made up your mind,
I'm out of here.

08:39.241 --> 08:41.452
-Lexie...
-I'm on strike.

08:41.534 --> 08:43.620
And she can sell
that to the bank.

08:47.415 --> 08:49.167
Talk to her, will you, Golly?

08:50.460 --> 08:52.669
Seems to me she's
said it all, son.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.011
Duncan?

09:15.688 --> 09:17.440
That went well.

09:17.523 --> 09:21.026
Oh, well. Never mind, Archie,
it's all part of
the learning curve.

09:21.109 --> 09:23.236
This way we won't
have to pay them at all.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.365
-You knew this would happen,
didn't you?
-I anticipated it, yeah.

09:26.448 --> 09:28.908
Well, maybe you've anticipated
how we can run this place

09:28.991 --> 09:31.118
with no housekeeper
and no grounds staff.

09:31.202 --> 09:34.329
It's called multi-skilling.
Management steps in
and keeps the show going.

09:34.412 --> 09:37.165
-Management?
Meaning you and me?
-Meaning you.

09:37.248 --> 09:39.541
I'm going to be negotiating
with the workforce.

09:39.625 --> 09:42.127
After all, they're not
gonna listen to you any more,
are they?

09:42.211 --> 09:44.171
If you want my advice...

09:44.254 --> 09:46.756
Thanks, Arch, but I've
taken on some pretty heavy
unions in my time.

09:46.839 --> 09:49.509
I think I can manage
two yokels and a cook.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.808
(GRUNTING)

10:01.644 --> 10:05.814
Economy drive, eh?
My late wife
was fond of those.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.733
She once sold all my cigars
and cancelled my
club memberships.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.819
Turned out she
was spending the lot
on her tango instructor.

10:13.153 --> 10:15.947
-I really am grateful,
Kilwillie.
-Oh, nonsense.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.616
Pleasure's all mine.
I can always use good dogs.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.201
Come on, chaps.

10:21.284 --> 10:24.121
I don't suppose
you've got any other assets
going spare, have you?

10:24.204 --> 10:26.081
I'm rather
short of a good chef
just at the moment.

10:26.164 --> 10:28.541
-No, sorry.
-No, of course not.

10:30.876 --> 10:35.255
Don't worry, Archie.
They'll be feted like kings.
Promise.

10:43.304 --> 10:45.221
(DOGS WHINING)

10:54.896 --> 10:57.815
What on earth?
Have the clocks
gone back or something?

10:57.898 --> 10:59.400
Good morning.
What can I get you?

10:59.483 --> 11:01.152
Some breakfast
would be a start.

11:02.153 --> 11:04.279
Lexie's not ill, is she?

11:04.362 --> 11:06.615
Help yourself to cereal.

11:09.241 --> 11:12.703
-It's a variety pack.
-I know that.
What do I do with it?

11:12.786 --> 11:15.913
Look, I could cook you
something, providing I have
the ingredients.

11:15.997 --> 11:18.416
-Porridge,
please, plenty of salt.
-Porridge, right.

11:18.499 --> 11:21.627
Eggs,
bacon, sausage, black pudding
and fried bread.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.504
Oh, just some fruit
salad for me, dear.

11:24.588 --> 11:28.466
-Look, what are you up to?
Where is Lexie?
-Lexie...

11:28.549 --> 11:31.052
-Lexie's on strike.
-Strike?

11:31.135 --> 11:34.971
Good grief. The Red
Menace reaches Glenbogle.

11:35.055 --> 11:36.848
Just give me 20 minutes,
all right?

11:36.931 --> 11:38.807
Oh, never mind, forget it.
I'm going for a walk.

11:38.891 --> 11:40.976
-Monty! Rommel!
-Er, they've gone.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.980
The dogs, they've gone.
I've already taken
them to Kilwillie's.

11:46.064 --> 11:47.607
I see.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.943
-I know I should've let
you say goodbye, but...
-Goodbye?

11:50.026 --> 11:52.611
My dear boy,
Monty and Rommel
had many talents,

11:52.694 --> 11:54.488
but conversation
wasn't one of them.

11:54.571 --> 11:58.616
-I'm sorry.
-For heaven's sake.
They're only dogs.

11:58.699 --> 12:01.243
I think I can find my
way around my own grounds.

12:02.578 --> 12:05.246
I'll, um, I think I'll
make myself something.

12:06.039 --> 12:07.207
Right.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.420
That was magnificent, Lexie.

13:03.503 --> 13:05.714
I should have got myself
a housekeeper years ago.

13:05.797 --> 13:10.634
Ha! You should have moved
in with me. I've got
a better CD collection.

13:10.718 --> 13:12.720
I feel safer
with Golly somehow.

13:14.929 --> 13:17.390
Um, where are you going?

13:17.473 --> 13:22.352
I'm going up to feed the
pheasants and take some
fodder up to the...

13:22.436 --> 13:25.022
...up to the deer. Except
I'm on strike, am I not?

13:25.105 --> 13:28.065
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

like, pretend it's a day off.

-I've never had
a day off in my life.
-Don't worry.

and set up picket lines,
list our demands.

Right. So...

13:51.835 --> 13:53.962
What are our demands?

13:56.881 --> 13:58.883
Blast!

13:58.966 --> 14:02.677

you mind, er, awfully if we
change the music?

14:02.761 --> 14:04.930
Mmm? Sorry, what?

14:05.013 --> 14:08.224
You see, I can't concentrate
on my swing with this flowery
nonsense on the gramophone.

er, try this for a change.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.400
(UPBEAT
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

14:26.281 --> 14:28.449
(SQUEAKING)

14:41.794 --> 14:44.046
Bad idea. I'm all
you've got at the moment.

14:46.839 --> 14:51.301
-Archie, tell me something.
-Are you planning
a pre-emptive strike?

14:51.385 --> 14:54.346
Now, who owns these tracks
leading into
Kilwillie's estate?

14:54.429 --> 14:56.889
-Well, we do of course.
-So who uses them?

14:56.973 --> 15:00.935
Kilwillie's forestry people.
Otherwise he'd have to
airlift out his timber.

15:01.018 --> 15:03.395
And how much do we charge him?

15:03.478 --> 15:05.188
Look,
he's a neighbour, a friend.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.524
I'm not gonna ask him
to pay for access
to his own land.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.484
No.

15:10.567 --> 15:13.070
I noticed some dodgy
guttering just outside.

15:13.153 --> 15:16.197
-What?
-Guttering, Archie.
A stitch in time.

15:31.335 --> 15:35.630
Rights for workers!
No compulsory pay cuts.

15:35.714 --> 15:39.091
-Duncan,
I am one of the workers.
-No, you're not.

15:39.174 --> 15:42.386
You're a scab.
You're a back leg.

15:43.679 --> 15:45.805
Blackleg.

15:45.888 --> 15:50.143
-Aye, that and all.
-Look, I'm just fixing
some guttering, that's all.

15:50.226 --> 15:52.644
Well, you shouldn't!

15:52.728 --> 15:57.231
And you should be
using weatherproof mastic,
not the bathroom stuff.

15:57.315 --> 16:01.235
-Do you wanna do this?
-Rights for workers.

16:01.319 --> 16:06.197
A fair day's pay for
a fair day's...work.

16:06.281 --> 16:08.199
I can't hear you, sorry.

16:09.658 --> 16:10.868
Scab.

16:13.746 --> 16:18.207
Scab. Scab! Scab! Scab!

16:18.291 --> 16:20.918
Do you wanna put your foot
on the bottom rung, please?

16:22.544 --> 16:25.255
Thanks. Carry on.

16:25.339 --> 16:30.134
Archie out! Archie out!
Archie, Archie, Archie!

16:30.217 --> 16:33.011
Duncan. So you're back?

16:33.094 --> 16:35.138
No, I'm not.

16:35.221 --> 16:37.140
This is an official picket.

16:37.224 --> 16:39.433
You know, I still
haven't heard your demands.

16:39.516 --> 16:42.436
Perhaps you'd
like to present them
over a cup of tea?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.438
You can bring your banner.

16:53.737 --> 16:56.781
It's all right, don't mind me.
I'll just carry on, shall I?

17:07.499 --> 17:09.124
Hector!

17:09.208 --> 17:11.961
Oh. Sorry, old girl,
I'm afraid you're
rather in the way.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.878
Why do you have to
be in here at all?

17:13.963 --> 17:15.964
Why do you have to be in here?

17:17.048 --> 17:18.424
It's warm, and
you know

17:18.508 --> 17:20.384
perfectly well that the
heating is turned
off upstairs.

17:20.467 --> 17:23.136
I can't paint
with frozen fingers.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.556
Well,
hypothermia is not exactly
going to improve my golf.

17:25.638 --> 17:27.265
It certainly
couldn't make it any worse.

17:27.348 --> 17:30.017
And why do we have to listen
to that dreadful racket?

17:30.101 --> 17:32.727
Racket?
That is John Philip Sousa.

17:32.811 --> 17:35.939
Oh, it sounds like a
herd of elephants rampaging
through a steel mill.

17:36.022 --> 17:40.025
-No, no, no, let's just
hear the, the last side.
-No, Hector. Sorry, no!

17:40.109 --> 17:41.944
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Ah!

17:46.698 --> 17:50.993
-You've scratched it.
-Really? What a tragic
loss to the world of music.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.043
(RECORD LOOPING)

18:12.428 --> 18:13.637
Biscuit?

18:18.558 --> 18:21.018
Oops, sorry. Crumbs.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.689
So what you're saying is,
you'd like your old jobs back?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.399
Aye.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.693
And proper wages, too.

18:30.776 --> 18:36.531
Well,
I'd love to help, Duncan,
but we can't afford it.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.657
Oh.

18:38.741 --> 18:42.953
But, if you return to
work now, it'll stand you in
good stead for the future.

18:43.037 --> 18:45.038
Eh?

18:45.121 --> 18:50.168
Well, when we reopen, there'll
be positions available for
a field sports manager,

18:50.251 --> 18:53.128
and a domestic supervisor,
and a...

18:54.796 --> 18:56.297
head ranger.

18:58.841 --> 19:00.593
A head ranger?

19:22.569 --> 19:26.156
These radiators haven't
been turned off for years.
You must have upset it.

19:26.239 --> 19:28.157
What do you suggest?
Counselling?

19:28.241 --> 19:30.993
Well, Lexie's
the only person who knows
how to keep it working.

19:31.077 --> 19:33.453
Well,
you'd better learn quick.

19:33.537 --> 19:36.915
Oh, certainly. Just pass
me that instruction manual
and I'll get right onto it.

19:36.998 --> 19:39.458
What manual? There... Fine.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.794
So it's a job for
the Yellow Pages.

19:41.877 --> 19:45.255
Been there, done it.
The callout charge
at Glenbogle is Â£300.

19:45.338 --> 19:47.757
All we have to do is ask
Lexie to have a look at it.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.260
No, all we have to do
is keep our coats on.

19:57.974 --> 20:00.560
Okay, the clothes go in here,
the soap goes in here.

20:00.643 --> 20:04.729
Really, I've tried being
reasonable, but I might
as well speak to Big Eric.

20:04.813 --> 20:07.190
I know, Mother.
Now, in order to
organise a wash...

20:07.274 --> 20:11.151
All I need is
a little private space
to pursue my own interests.

20:11.235 --> 20:12.945
And the programmes
are listed here.

20:13.028 --> 20:15.530
I'm not married
to a human being,
I'm married to a set of clubs.

20:15.613 --> 20:18.908
Mother, please, I can't do
everything. I need to show
you how this works.

20:18.992 --> 20:24.413
Archie, darling, if I run
out of smalls, I'll get on the
phone and order some more.

20:24.496 --> 20:27.999
Now you must excuse me,
your father is
wreaking havoc in my studio.

20:33.753 --> 20:35.297
(LEXIE CLEARING THROAT)

20:35.380 --> 20:37.382
Is this you
picketing the main gate?

20:37.465 --> 20:39.133
Not much point while
the bridge is down.

20:39.216 --> 20:42.094
The point is to try and win
some solidarity.

20:42.177 --> 20:44.096
Let the outside world know
what's going on.

20:44.178 --> 20:46.764
I thought that was your job.
Where's the massed
ranks of the media?

20:46.848 --> 20:48.349
Where's your television
helicopters?

20:48.433 --> 20:50.350
Well, what we need
is an angle.

20:50.434 --> 20:54.354
I mean, something that the
public can really get
worked up about.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.189
What are you
doing up here anyway?

20:56.272 --> 20:58.733
Pheasants, they haven't
been fed since yesterday.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.819
That's it!

21:01.903 --> 21:05.572
"Callous management lays off
workers while the livestock
starve." It's perfect.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.574
Look.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.450
LEXIE: Archie, you creep.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.994
I knew he wouldn't let
the beasts go hungry.

21:12.077 --> 21:14.662
Oh, but it's all right for
us to starve, is that it?

21:14.746 --> 21:16.706
You're taking this
awful personal, Lexie.

21:16.789 --> 21:18.291
It is personal.

21:18.374 --> 21:21.585
He's supposed to
stand up for us,
not lay down for Stella.

21:21.668 --> 21:24.004
I could do with
some help down here.

21:24.087 --> 21:25.380
Come on.

21:27.548 --> 21:28.799
Come on.

21:55.656 --> 21:57.740
What do you mean that
you're not gonna picket?

21:57.823 --> 21:59.617
It might
jeopardise my prospects.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.495
Stella says that
when Glenbogle reopens,
I could get to be head ranger.

22:03.578 --> 22:06.873
And what else
did she offer you?
A wee hat with a badge on it?

22:06.957 --> 22:10.501
-A whistling signet ring?
-It's just...

22:10.584 --> 22:13.212
I don't know what
we're trying to achieve.

22:13.295 --> 22:16.673
We are trying to achieve
parity with the livestock.

22:16.756 --> 22:20.801
-She says we're not
even a proper union.
-Duncan...

22:20.884 --> 22:23.595
Why are you listening
to that conniving cow?

22:23.679 --> 22:28.015
I suppose she gave you the
little-girl-lost look, asked
for your advice, did she?

22:30.017 --> 22:31.686
Oh, Duncan.

22:31.769 --> 22:33.895
Can't you see?

22:33.979 --> 22:35.981
She's manipulating you.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.732
Stick with your friends.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.527
Stick with
the people you can trust.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.863
I'd never treat you that way.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.613
Oh, crumbs.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.284
Now, this is a microwave.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.785
Can't a chap
play a round of golf
in his own living room

22:51.869 --> 22:54.121
without being
branded a war criminal?

22:54.204 --> 22:59.250
Remember, no metal. You simply
decant the food, pop her
in here, close the door...

22:59.333 --> 23:02.711
If a chap can't practise,
he exposes
himself to ridicule.

23:02.794 --> 23:05.714
These days all I've
got left is my dignity.

23:07.716 --> 23:10.801
Why don't you have a go?

23:10.885 --> 23:13.387
-What do I do with this?
-I thought you
were in the army.

23:13.470 --> 23:18.516
I was, that's why I can
strip down a machine gun
and defuse a live torpedo.

23:18.600 --> 23:22.019
You don't learn that
in the Catering Corps.
When is Lexie coming back?

23:22.811 --> 23:24.897
I don't know.

23:24.980 --> 23:28.733
You'll have to stand in
for her, then. And none of
that nouvelle cuisine muck.

23:28.816 --> 23:31.819
-Where are going?
-I'm going to
practise my swing.

23:31.903 --> 23:35.238
It's so cold in this house,
I'm gonna try my luck outside.

23:45.622 --> 23:46.956
Has the heating packed up?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.500
It's freezing in
the Big House.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.709
I thought it was
kind of bracing.

23:50.792 --> 23:54.505
Well, not that you would know.
Nice and cosy in here.

23:54.588 --> 23:59.509
How's the strike going, Lexie?
Need any help with
pickets or publicity?

23:59.592 --> 24:04.054
Thanks, but we can manage
without you, better than you
can manage without us.

24:04.137 --> 24:07.349
Oh, we'll get by.
Though Archie's
having a hard time of it.

24:07.432 --> 24:09.975
Oh, no. Is he?

24:10.059 --> 24:13.020
You know,
for a girl with big bones,
you really are transparent.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.313
Dangling the head ranger's job
in front of Duncan,

24:15.396 --> 24:18.775
expecting me to take pity on
the poor wee laird.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.776
Archie's made his own bed.

24:20.859 --> 24:24.279
-You can lie in it.
-Funny way to put it.

24:24.363 --> 24:28.699
And when you begin to wise up,
you can come and speak
to me, okay? Not Duncan.

24:28.783 --> 24:31.369
-Duncan can think for himself.
-Aye, right.

24:31.452 --> 24:33.745
Until you work your
feminine charms on him.

24:33.829 --> 24:36.540
Well, two can play
at that game, darling.

24:36.623 --> 24:39.166
Archie's not my weakness.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.626
He's yours.

24:58.641 --> 25:00.935
Oh, no soup?

25:01.018 --> 25:03.103
I haven't had time to
prepare soup, I'm sorry.

25:03.186 --> 25:06.648
It would help to warm us up.
Lexie always has
a big pot on the go.

25:06.731 --> 25:08.357
Yes, well, Lexie is not here,
is she?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.860
I'm well aware of that,
darling.

25:12.862 --> 25:16.489
Look at this. Look at it.
That is sheer
unmitigated vandalism.

25:16.573 --> 25:19.992
No, dear,
vandalism's when you punch
holes in paintings.

25:20.075 --> 25:23.453
That was an accident, damn it.
What am I
supposed to do with this?

25:23.537 --> 25:26.914
-Take up billiards?
-Will you please sit
down and eat your lunch?

25:26.998 --> 25:30.209
If you go anywhere near my
clubs again, I will not be
responsible for my actions.

25:30.293 --> 25:32.335
-Have you ever been?
-I...

25:34.087 --> 25:36.339
What's this? Where's the soup?

25:43.012 --> 25:46.473
-What on earth's
got into the boy?
-You're his father.

25:46.556 --> 25:50.309
How dare you?
I had nothing to do
with his upbringing.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.898
-Lexie.
-You look wrecked.

25:56.981 --> 25:59.525
-Do you want me to
run you a hot bath?
-We've no hot water.

25:59.609 --> 26:01.652
I could warm it up for you.
Oh.

26:01.736 --> 26:05.739
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I'm on strike.

26:05.822 --> 26:08.741
If you've come here to gloat,
you can go somewhere else.

26:08.824 --> 26:11.410
In fact, Kilwillie's
looking for a new cook.
I'm sure he pays well.

26:11.494 --> 26:13.662
This is not about the money.

26:13.746 --> 26:17.248
No, it's about making me feel
sorry for being the laird, for
having a duty to Glenbogle.

26:17.332 --> 26:21.293
The laird's first
duty is to his people,
not to his stately home.

26:21.376 --> 26:23.212
And which people are those?

26:23.295 --> 26:25.547
The ones up on
the hillside having a laugh
while I put my back out?

26:25.631 --> 26:27.423
I am the only people
I've got at the moment.

26:27.507 --> 26:30.134
You decided to
cosy up to Stella.

26:32.719 --> 26:37.390
I don't believe it.
You're stirring things
up because you're jealous.

26:37.474 --> 26:41.018
You think Katrina's gone,
Lexie's next. Wahey!

26:41.101 --> 26:44.229
What am I, a fringe benefit?
Wouldn't you
rather a company car?

26:44.312 --> 26:45.939
Dream on, MacDonald.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.067
That's why you come round here
sticking your
bosom in my face.

26:49.150 --> 26:52.444
You think, "Archie's a bloke,
that'll get his attention."

26:52.528 --> 26:54.321
It might have worked if
I wasn't so knackered.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.448
You're not knackered yet,
your Lairdship.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.953
Rights for workers!

27:06.665 --> 27:08.624
Rights for wo...

27:08.707 --> 27:12.336
Duncan, I'm disappointed.

27:12.419 --> 27:15.213
A fair day's work
for a fair day's work.

27:15.296 --> 27:18.842
-No...
-It's all right.
I know what you're after.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.890
Rights for workers!

28:06.047 --> 28:08.466
How did we get
into this mess, Golly?

28:08.549 --> 28:12.178
-Leadership.
-Oh, right,
of course, it's my fault.

28:12.261 --> 28:15.597
-This isn't easy for me.
-And do you think
it's easy for us?

28:15.680 --> 28:20.267
Look, Archie, I want to work,
but I'm not gonna
be taken for a mug.

28:20.350 --> 28:23.353
Why have I become the only
person who cares about
keeping Glenbogle going?

28:23.437 --> 28:26.481
You're not. That is why you
should have asked us for help

28:26.564 --> 28:28.107
instead of trying to
impose a solution.

28:28.191 --> 28:29.859
It was either pay cuts
or layoffs.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.194
Ah, that was
Stella's strategy.

28:32.277 --> 28:36.239
-You didn't have to accept it.
-Golly,
I didn't have any choice.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.574
You always have a choice, son.

29:22.277 --> 29:26.155
So tell me about Golly.
Was he born on the estate?

29:26.239 --> 29:30.535
Not exactly.
He was hewn out of
the same rock as this house.

29:30.618 --> 29:32.285
You won't budge him so easily.

29:32.369 --> 29:35.705
But he's one of these guys
that lives to work, isn't he?

29:35.789 --> 29:39.250
-You're looking
for his weak point.
-It's standard procedure.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.252
According to whom?

29:41.335 --> 29:44.295
Thatcher's Bumper
Book of Strike Busting?

29:44.379 --> 29:46.381
You still think this place is
just another business.

29:46.464 --> 29:49.633
Some clapped-out factory in
hock to the unions.

29:49.716 --> 29:54.179
-The principle's the same.
-I hadn't noticed
principle coming into it.

29:54.263 --> 29:56.597
Oh,
don't go soft on me, Archie.

29:56.681 --> 30:00.476
I give them 24 hours
before they're back here
asking for a meeting.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.227
You think we can
last that long?

30:02.310 --> 30:06.231
Why not?
We have food,
we have light, we have power.

30:09.984 --> 30:12.111
Well, we have food anyway.

30:20.659 --> 30:23.287
-Genny's gone down.
-Good.

30:23.370 --> 30:26.080
Maybe Archie'll
fall down the stairs
and land on Stella.

30:26.164 --> 30:29.375
Oh, maybe now they'll
be willing to negotiate.

30:29.459 --> 30:32.252
Forget it.
We're not negotiating.

30:32.335 --> 30:35.046
So what are we gonna do,
just sit around in the dark?

30:35.130 --> 30:37.048
Look,
Stella wants to settle this.

30:37.132 --> 30:41.886
Not you as well.
She flutters her eyelashes
and you're blown away.

30:41.969 --> 30:44.679
Why not?
It's always worked for you.

30:44.763 --> 30:46.806
GOLLY: Okay, okay.

30:46.890 --> 30:51.560
-Lexie, what do you propose?
-I propose that we
talk to Kilwillie.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.188
-I'm not
working for Kilwillie.
-Oh, no?

30:54.271 --> 30:58.983
You were the one who wanted to
be senior chief executive
in charge of ranging.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.319
Are we in this
together or not?

31:01.402 --> 31:05.572
Maybe it's just a wee bit
too soon to be giving up.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.365
I'm not the one
talking about giving up.

31:07.449 --> 31:10.117
Look, Stella can't run
that place without Archie.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.496
Maybe if we talk to him.

31:13.578 --> 31:17.082
Oh,
I've tried talking to Archie
and he wouldn't listen.

31:17.165 --> 31:20.667
Aye, right.
That's what's bugging you.

31:20.751 --> 31:25.089
I'm not gonna settle
for a few chocolate
biscuits and a job title.

31:25.172 --> 31:27.131
Oh, no.

31:27.215 --> 31:30.843
Unless, of course,
it's Katrina's job title.

31:30.927 --> 31:32.761
Lexie.

31:32.844 --> 31:36.306
You can go back with your
tails between your legs.
Go ahead.

31:38.015 --> 31:39.475
Mind and wear brown, though.

31:39.558 --> 31:43.229
That way when she
wipes her boots on you,
it won't show.

31:48.066 --> 31:49.775
What's the matter with it?

31:49.858 --> 31:52.528
Apart from anything else,
it belongs in a museum.

31:52.611 --> 31:56.322
-I thought it was in a museum.
-Duncan usually
keeps it going.

31:56.406 --> 31:59.700
Oh, no, not again.
What are you for exactly?

31:59.784 --> 32:02.953
I mean, I know you're
the laird, but do you
actually serve a purpose?

32:03.036 --> 32:08.332
Yes, I do, actually. Running
around plugging holes in
your brilliant strategy.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.709
Since you started
playing your power games,

32:10.793 --> 32:15.004
my home has been
falling apart, my parents are
headed for a divorce,

32:15.088 --> 32:17.132
I'm in line for a hernia.

32:17.215 --> 32:20.300
If you really wanna
cut overheads, you should
consider firing yourself

32:20.384 --> 32:24.555
because all your
so-called economies
are costing us a fortune.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.139
(CLEARING THROAT)

32:26.222 --> 32:28.808
To think I let you sucker me
into dumping on my friends.

32:28.891 --> 32:30.935
Where are you going?

32:31.018 --> 32:34.980
I've reached the end of
my learning curve, Stella,
and I'm taking off.

32:55.705 --> 32:56.789
Hi.

33:01.960 --> 33:05.922
I was looking for
a hotbed of sedition
and conspiracy.

33:06.006 --> 33:07.840
Very subtle, Archie.

33:07.923 --> 33:10.176
You should belong to the MI5.

33:12.261 --> 33:15.513
-Look, I'm really sorry.
-Ach.

33:15.597 --> 33:17.932
Should never
have come to this.

33:19.433 --> 33:23.520
Er, you tell Stella
that we're willing to meet.

33:23.604 --> 33:28.524
Er, no, hold on minute. You
can't give in. I'm the one
person Stella can do without.

33:28.608 --> 33:33.361
If you guys go back now, I'm
stuffed. No, no, no,
I came up here to join you.

33:35.322 --> 33:37.365
Welcome to the union.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.910
Well, as it happens,
we are short a member.

33:42.661 --> 33:44.621
Well, where's Lexie?

33:44.704 --> 33:49.416
Och,
there's just a...wee bit of
a dispute about our motives.

33:53.253 --> 33:55.838
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:55.922 --> 33:57.632
Oh, no.

34:00.468 --> 34:03.387
Stella.
I thought you'd gone home.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.224
Well, I would have but
my bike's stopped working.
It's no problem, I'll walk.

34:07.307 --> 34:10.016
Och, in this weather?
Oh, don't be so silly.

34:10.101 --> 34:13.103
You must stay the night.
Come along. Come on.

34:22.319 --> 34:26.489
I hope you don't mind salad.
I'm afraid it's all we
can offer at the moment.

34:26.572 --> 34:28.658
I'm not eating that.
I'm not a blasted cow.

34:28.741 --> 34:32.953
No, dear, cows are very
useful. They give us milk
and meat and leather.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.830
-Whereas you...
-Ah!

34:36.706 --> 34:40.668
The hunter-gatherer
brings forth his trophy.

34:40.751 --> 34:43.628
Now you just have
to wait 12 hours
for it to defrost.

34:43.712 --> 34:45.714
That's what you think.

34:45.797 --> 34:47.841
Archie showed me
a few tricks of the trade
before you drove him off.

34:55.429 --> 34:58.516
-Hector, it's a microwave.
-I know that.

35:00.435 --> 35:01.935
It's electric.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.062
Well, of course it's elec...

35:05.647 --> 35:08.315
Ah.

35:08.399 --> 35:12.778
Yeah, but that is
all this is to Stella.
It's just a job.

35:12.862 --> 35:15.071
And we push her too far,
she'll just flog the place

35:15.155 --> 35:17.532
and head off back to
the big smoke, end of story.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.825
No, she could have
done that weeks ago.

35:19.908 --> 35:22.995
She's got
something else going on.

35:23.078 --> 35:24.955
I wish Katrina was around.

35:25.039 --> 35:27.290
Am I not cute
enough for you, no?

35:27.373 --> 35:30.626
Yeah, but you don't
have her head for strategy.

35:30.710 --> 35:34.963
Katrina would never
take Stella head-on.
She'd redefine the problem.

35:35.047 --> 35:37.049
How do you mean?

35:37.132 --> 35:40.926
Well, she'd dream up some
proposal allowing the workers
a say in the management,

35:41.009 --> 35:43.344
and present it as some kind
of alternative approach.

35:43.428 --> 35:47.848
And that way, you guys get
to keep your jobs and Stella
wouldn't lose face.

35:48.516 --> 35:49.683
Go on.

35:56.646 --> 35:58.858
Do you play golf, Stella?

35:58.941 --> 36:02.069
I'm sure she has much
more useful things to do
with her time.

36:02.152 --> 36:04.028
Like painting, you mean.

36:04.112 --> 36:07.448
If you want to be useful,
why don't you give
the ceiling a couple of coats?

36:07.531 --> 36:09.325
I paint to express myself.

36:09.408 --> 36:12.078
I never knew you had a problem
expressing yourself.

36:12.161 --> 36:14.411
This looks wonderful.

36:14.496 --> 36:18.166
-What is it?
-Venison omelette.

36:18.249 --> 36:20.000
I'm sorry,
I'm not much of a cook.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.710
On the contrary,
you're a very
capable young woman.

36:22.794 --> 36:25.630
One sometimes gets a bit bored
with the purely
decorative sort.

36:25.713 --> 36:28.841
Oh, I don't think
anyone could ever accuse you
of being decorative, Hector.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.510
What do you mean?

36:30.593 --> 36:33.929
Tell me, did you two
ever try living together
after you got married?

36:34.012 --> 36:36.098
What?

36:36.181 --> 36:39.475
Well, you seem incapable of
getting on unless you have
an entire wing to yourselves.

36:39.558 --> 36:44.229
I suppose you're used
to sharing a bathroom.

36:44.312 --> 36:47.732
Yes, I am, actually.
I've got four
brothers and two sisters

36:47.816 --> 36:49.775
and we grew up in
a three-bedroom council house.

36:49.858 --> 36:51.652
Sometimes we didn't have
anything to eat at all,

36:51.735 --> 36:54.530
let alone venison and
quail's eggs.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.572
And we still managed
to like each other.

36:57.949 --> 37:01.119
-I'll get the plates.
-Oh.

37:01.201 --> 37:03.161
Spare your nice soft hands.

37:10.209 --> 37:11.711
(RATTLING)

37:20.259 --> 37:22.010
(PIPES GURGLING)

37:32.811 --> 37:34.187
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

37:34.271 --> 37:37.024
If you want to use my
bathroom, Hector, forget it.

37:37.107 --> 37:39.483
There's no water
in here, either.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.611
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

37:51.994 --> 37:56.205
Ah, there you are. I, er...

37:56.289 --> 38:01.334
Just wanted to say that
I wouldn't be
happy living in my wing

38:01.418 --> 38:04.629
if you weren't knocking
about in the other one.

38:05.630 --> 38:08.883
That's all really. Good night.

38:08.966 --> 38:12.219
-Hector, are you
going to be warm enough?
-I doubt it.

38:12.303 --> 38:15.472
Because there's
a rather effective,
if old-fashioned way,

38:15.555 --> 38:17.557
that we could both keep warm.

38:28.566 --> 38:30.193
(MOUSE SQUEAKS)

38:47.624 --> 38:50.417
Now, is this what you wanted?

38:50.501 --> 38:53.212
-Yes, dear, get mopping.
-Oh, really.

38:53.295 --> 38:55.922
-Why can't we
just wear wellies?
-What are you doing?

38:56.005 --> 38:59.759
Pigeon in the water tank,
I think. Archie's always
dealt with them before.

38:59.842 --> 39:03.720
Shouldn't cost much to repair.
Unless the whole
ceiling comes down, of course.

39:03.804 --> 39:06.598
Stella, darling,
I know you're the expert,

39:06.682 --> 39:10.267
but three
people to run a house
the size of Glenbogle,

39:10.351 --> 39:12.728
it's hardly over-manning,
is it?

39:28.032 --> 39:31.159
This'll be you
bringing us up the bill
for our coffee, then?

39:31.243 --> 39:33.662
Actually,
I'm here to discuss staffing
on the estate.

39:33.745 --> 39:36.498
Sorry,
but we're not available.

39:36.581 --> 39:40.251
We're now employees
of the Glenbogle
Workers' Cooperative.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.128
Mmm, catchy.

39:42.211 --> 39:46.089
Well, it's certainly
more of a ring to it
than "two yokels and a cook".

39:46.172 --> 39:50.926
So would this, er, Cooperative
be interested in
a long-term contract?

39:52.761 --> 39:55.471
I don't know.
What do you think?

39:55.555 --> 39:58.766
Oh, I think
she'll need to speak to
our area organiser, Duncan.

40:00.018 --> 40:03.103
You'll need to speak
to our area organiser.

40:03.186 --> 40:05.856
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

40:05.939 --> 40:08.524
We supply the labour,
the fodder for the animals,

40:08.607 --> 40:11.360
the fuel for the vehicles,
for a fixed monthly figure.

40:11.444 --> 40:16.114
That way you get to control
expenditure and cut back on
your overheads.

40:16.197 --> 40:20.409
Okay. Make me an offer and
I'll see how it
compares to the other tenders.

40:20.492 --> 40:22.870
Well, you know you
won't get a better deal
anywhere else.

40:22.953 --> 40:26.331
And Glenbogle will fall to
bits while you're looking.

40:26.414 --> 40:29.959
If I really wanted
to save on overheads,
I'd sell the place.

40:30.043 --> 40:32.544
What, go back to
London and admit defeat?

40:32.627 --> 40:35.047
Write off all those debts?

40:35.130 --> 40:38.966
-That's not why you
came up here, is it?
-So...

40:39.050 --> 40:43.094
-You'd supply the gillie,
the ranger...
-Head ranger.

40:43.178 --> 40:46.473
The head ranger
and the housekeeper?

40:47.599 --> 40:50.059
Ah, yes, the housekeeper.

40:50.142 --> 40:54.146
Um, I might need a bit
of time to work on that.

40:54.229 --> 40:56.272
She's defected to Kilwillie.

40:56.356 --> 40:58.483
I've got some
business with Kilwillie.

41:10.117 --> 41:13.703
(LOVE IS
THE SWEETEST THING PLAYING)

41:15.246 --> 41:16.456
Right.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.250
Fore.

41:23.295 --> 41:25.672
Yes, dear! Hole in one!

41:39.475 --> 41:41.227
KILWILLIE: Oh, dear.

41:41.310 --> 41:44.062
She assured me
that you'd
dispensed with her services.

41:44.145 --> 41:45.563
I wouldn't have
taken her on otherwise.

41:45.647 --> 41:48.316
I know. I'm sorry,
I've put you in
a very awkward position.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.695
No, no, no. But the thing is,
she does seem
rather set in her ways.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.863
When I simply
suggested that breakfast
might be slightly overcooked,

41:55.947 --> 41:57.907
I thought she was
gonna run me through
with a sausage.

41:57.991 --> 42:00.493
Yeah,
she does take some handling.

42:03.912 --> 42:09.375
Have you seen that?
It's a twelve ring hob
with fan assisted ovens.

42:09.458 --> 42:14.546
I've got an infrared
split-level toaster.

42:14.629 --> 42:19.800
Although,
well, all I cook is, um,
boiled cabbage and roly-poly.

42:19.883 --> 42:22.177
The man lives
off school dinners.

42:22.261 --> 42:26.514
But,
um, you should see my room.
Satellite TV, power shower.

42:26.597 --> 42:29.642
Though I can't grow mushrooms
like I did at Glenbogle.

42:29.726 --> 42:32.561
Lexie, I've been an idiot.

42:32.644 --> 42:35.605
I couldn't see what
was under my nose.

42:35.689 --> 42:39.608
That was my bosom.
I'm sorry if it offended you.

42:39.692 --> 42:43.069
No, I didn't find your
bosom offensive, I found it...

42:43.153 --> 42:46.906
I mean, I was tired,
I was angry. I didn't know
what I was saying.

42:46.990 --> 42:50.075
It's okay. I know.

42:51.243 --> 42:54.871
Look, I'm sorry.

42:54.954 --> 43:00.418
-Do you want me to grovel?
-Go ahead if it makes
you feel any better.

43:00.501 --> 43:02.586
There's nothing going
on between me and Stella.

43:02.669 --> 43:06.632
You can grab her
gaskins all you want, Arch,
it's no skin off my nose.

43:06.715 --> 43:09.175
I wasn't. I wouldn't.
For goodness sake,
Katrina's just left.

43:09.258 --> 43:13.219
I'm hardly gonna throw myself
at Stella, even if she did
wanna catch me.

43:14.638 --> 43:16.931
Lexie, come back, please.

43:17.849 --> 43:20.100
And what for?

43:20.184 --> 43:22.519
What is there for
me at Glenbogle?

43:24.854 --> 43:27.357
Glenbogle's your home,
you've always said so.

43:28.650 --> 43:31.360
Well, maybe it's
time I flew the nest.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.994
I'll send your
stuff over, then.

43:46.498 --> 43:49.667
Thanks. That'd be great.

44:02.010 --> 44:05.806
But that's blackmail.
We've used those forest
tracks for generations.

44:05.889 --> 44:08.015
Look, you're running
commercial traffic up there.

44:08.099 --> 44:11.978
It's for your benefit as much
as ours that we make it
a formal arrangement.

44:12.061 --> 44:15.188
I'm really not used to
dealing with my neighbours
in these terms.

44:15.271 --> 44:18.650
On businesslike terms,
you mean.

44:18.732 --> 44:21.610
Well, what sort of
figures are we talking?

44:23.362 --> 44:27.323
-Aren't those...
-Hector's? Yeah.

44:27.407 --> 44:29.993
He's always
banging on about what
wonderful hunters they were,

44:30.076 --> 44:34.121
but so far the only vermin
they've managed to tackle have
been my Jermyn Street brogues.

44:34.204 --> 44:36.123
Chewed them to pieces.

44:36.206 --> 44:39.709
I can't even let them
run loose. The other dogs
just bully them.

44:39.792 --> 44:43.169
-I might be able to
take them off your hands.
-Really?

44:43.253 --> 44:46.298
Depends what
you're willing to pay
for access to your land.

44:46.381 --> 44:49.133
Well, of all the nerve.

44:49.216 --> 44:51.593
3,000 a year.

44:51.677 --> 44:53.971
Five.

44:54.054 --> 44:57.515
3,500, and I'm
being very charitable.

44:57.598 --> 45:01.143
Oh, it's a shame to
see them like this.

45:01.226 --> 45:03.729
Hector's going
to be heartbroken.

45:05.147 --> 45:07.732
-3,700.
-Four.

45:09.191 --> 45:10.401
Done.

45:10.484 --> 45:12.403
(DOGS BARKING)

45:19.867 --> 45:21.243
Try it now.

45:54.438 --> 45:57.774
Well, I've turned all the
radiators back on upstairs.

45:57.857 --> 45:59.984
Well, there must be
something you can do.

46:00.068 --> 46:03.695
I could always
sacrifice an animal.
A sheep or a goat maybe.

46:03.779 --> 46:08.199
Well, you could sacrifice me
if it brought Lexie back.

46:08.282 --> 46:11.077
Have you all got
nits or something?

46:11.160 --> 46:13.912
The way you're
all standing there
scratching your heads.

46:13.995 --> 46:17.374
Honestly. Three grown men.

46:17.457 --> 46:21.585
All that wisdom and
experience and education,

46:21.669 --> 46:25.588
and you can't even handle
a cranky old
boiler like this one.

46:27.966 --> 46:29.801
(WHIRRING)

46:36.098 --> 46:37.848
Yes, brilliant.

46:40.726 --> 46:42.520
So you're back, then?

46:42.602 --> 46:45.522
I heard you'd a pool
installed upstairs.
Thought I might give it a go.

46:45.605 --> 46:48.941
You mean, Archie worked
his masculine charms on you.

46:52.778 --> 46:55.405
I'll tell you about Archie.

46:55.488 --> 46:58.741
It takes him awhile to get
there, but in the end,
he's loyal to his friends.

46:58.825 --> 47:04.371
That's why I came back.
Loyalty. The only thing you're
loyal to is your money.

47:04.454 --> 47:08.916
Some day you'll find out
that your money doesn't
give a damn about you.

47:24.846 --> 47:27.765
Shall we walk around the loch
and feed the midges?

47:27.849 --> 47:29.475
Yeah, let's do that.

47:29.559 --> 47:32.686
Or we could go up
to the fallen tree
and misbehave.

47:32.769 --> 47:34.605
Whatever you say, darling.

47:34.688 --> 47:39.150
You do miss having
Monty and Rommel around
to lead you about, don't you?

47:39.233 --> 47:41.694
Yes, they always used to know
where they were going.

47:41.777 --> 47:44.821
Happy to get there,
even happier to get back.

47:46.072 --> 47:48.408
I do miss them rather, yes.

47:48.491 --> 47:51.201
Perhaps I can
stand in for them.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.412
Of course you can, darling.

47:54.413 --> 47:55.705
Fetch.

47:55.788 --> 47:57.373
(DOGS BARKING)

47:57.457 --> 47:59.584
-Oh, Kilwillie.
-Hello!

47:59.667 --> 48:03.128
-Were they completely useless?
-HECTOR:
Rommel, there's a good boy.

48:03.211 --> 48:05.213
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks, I'm afraid.

48:05.297 --> 48:08.549
Oh, I don't know.
You should see
Hector handle a mop.

48:09.675 --> 48:11.928
A mop? You traitor.

48:15.931 --> 48:18.016
(MOUSE SQUEAKS)

48:36.781 --> 48:39.283
-You brought them back.
-Who?

48:39.367 --> 48:42.328
Those useless mutts
that were eating us
out of house and home.

48:42.411 --> 48:46.581
From now on, they sleep
in kennels, and they eat
leftovers like the rest of us.

48:46.665 --> 48:49.124
-You felt sorry
for them, didn't you?
-Not at all.

48:49.208 --> 48:52.795
Kilwillie paid me good money
to take them off his hands.

48:52.878 --> 48:55.213
I've come to
invite you to a feast.

48:55.296 --> 48:58.258
-Show you there
are no hard feelings.
-A feast?

48:58.341 --> 49:00.343
Who's paying for it?

49:00.426 --> 49:02.427
When the power went,
the freezer thawed out.

49:02.511 --> 49:05.180
We have venison, trout
and a side of
beef to get rid of.

49:06.472 --> 49:09.433
And it's not good
enough for the dogs?

49:09.517 --> 49:12.477
-Eight o'clock,
dress informal.
-I have a prior engagement.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.729
Like what? A mug of
cocoa with Duncan's aunt?

49:14.813 --> 49:18.732
Ah, Stella. Brought you
a present from the dogs.

49:18.816 --> 49:22.653
-That really won't
be necessary, Hector.
-A token of their esteem.

49:22.736 --> 49:27.824
A splendid example of
Apodemus sylvaticus,
the common field mouse.

49:27.907 --> 49:32.244
Er, shall I get rid of it
or start charging him rent?
Eh?

49:34.663 --> 49:36.581
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

49:36.664 --> 49:38.291
MOLLY: Come on, Duncan.

49:40.918 --> 49:43.753
HECTOR:
(LAUGHING) Ah, well done.

49:52.303 --> 49:53.762
Welcome home, Lex.

49:53.846 --> 49:56.222
You've still got
some grovelling to do.

50:13.987 --> 50:16.448
HECTOR:
(LAUGHING) Ah, well done.
