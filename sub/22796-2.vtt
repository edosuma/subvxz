doesn't leave

00:48.883 --> 00:50.592
till this

00:48.883 --> 00:50.592
afternoon, man.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.592
Correct.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.219
It does not leave

00:50.676 --> 00:52.219
till this afternoon,

00:52.302 --> 00:54.555
but guess what?

00:52.302 --> 00:54.555
Look at this.

00:54.638 --> 00:55.973
On the way to the

00:54.638 --> 00:55.973
airport, Ricky,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.099
there's a big cat

00:56.056 --> 00:58.099
rescue we can go to!

00:58.183 --> 01:01.020
(Sigh)

00:58.183 --> 01:01.020
It's got all

00:58.183 --> 01:01.020
kinds of<i> big cats</i>

01:01.102 --> 01:02.270
and we're going to

01:01.102 --> 01:02.270
go see them all.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.856
We can cram it in

01:02.354 --> 01:03.856
if we leave right now.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.608
Big cats can suck

01:03.939 --> 01:06.608
my cock right now.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.110
And why in the fuck is

01:06.692 --> 01:09.110
this stuck to my face?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.404
Oh, my God, Ricky,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
it's stuck

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
with man glue.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
Ah!

01:14.033 --> 01:16.201
I told you not to

01:14.033 --> 01:16.201
sleep face down.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.954
Well, I'm going

01:16.284 --> 01:18.954
to have a fucking shower

01:16.284 --> 01:18.954
then, before we go!

01:19.038 --> 01:20.497
Well, get the fuck

01:19.038 --> 01:20.497
moving,

01:20.581 --> 01:21.832
'cause we're leaving.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.832
Let's go.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.083
Bubs, tell me

01:21.916 --> 01:23.083
something.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.334
Why is this

01:23.166 --> 01:24.334
another day

01:24.418 --> 01:25.920
of doing shit

01:24.418 --> 01:25.920
you want to do?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.713
Well, it's not,

01:26.003 --> 01:27.713
but...

01:27.796 --> 01:28.964
it's on the way

01:27.796 --> 01:28.964
to the airport.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.549
These guys want

01:29.048 --> 01:30.549
to shoot it.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.217
I'm just doing

01:30.632 --> 01:32.217
what they say.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.553
Look, if you want

01:32.300 --> 01:34.553
to get out your big,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.553
fancy credit card

01:34.636 --> 01:36.889
and fucking book your

01:34.636 --> 01:36.889
own big, expensive limo

01:36.972 --> 01:38.891
to the airport,

01:36.972 --> 01:38.891
be my guest.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.810
But the Bubbles fun train

01:38.974 --> 01:41.810
is leaving right now.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.604
And you want to be

01:41.894 --> 01:43.604
on it. Let's go.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.065
What the fuck

01:43.687 --> 01:46.065
happened last night?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.482
Come on.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.482
Just let me wash

01:47.566 --> 01:50.110
this fucking cock

01:47.566 --> 01:50.110
yogurt off my face.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.779

01:51.862 --> 01:54.448

01:51.862 --> 01:54.448

01:55.991 --> 01:58.410
(Roaring)

02:00.704 --> 02:02.623
Bubbles:

02:00.704 --> 02:02.623
Decent! There's another one.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.207
Julian:

02:02.706 --> 02:04.207
Holy fuck, Bubs.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.251
Why did we have to come

02:04.291 --> 02:06.251
out here so fucking early?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.378
Bubbles:

02:06.334 --> 02:08.378
Because it's feeding

02:06.334 --> 02:08.378
time in the morning

02:08.462 --> 02:10.130
and I wanted to

02:08.462 --> 02:10.130
see the feeding.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.715
Julian: (Scoffing)

02:10.213 --> 02:11.715
It's feeding time.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.050
Ricky:

02:11.799 --> 02:13.050
They're pretty cool,

02:11.799 --> 02:13.050
but we can't...

02:13.133 --> 02:14.551
we can't look at

02:13.133 --> 02:14.551
all these cats, Bubs.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.803
There's over

02:14.635 --> 02:15.803
a hundred.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.471
We can look

02:15.886 --> 02:17.471
at all of them.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.264
We can look at every

02:17.554 --> 02:19.264
single one of them.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.683
They deserve it.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.683
It's going to take all

02:19.347 --> 02:21.683
fucking day, man.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.977
I'm not...

02:21.767 --> 02:22.977
Well, if it

02:21.767 --> 02:22.977
takes all day,

02:23.060 --> 02:24.812
it takes all day.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.812
I'm going to see

02:24.895 --> 02:26.563
every one

02:24.895 --> 02:26.563
of the kitties.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.148
Pss-pss-pss.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.441
Hey there.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.359
I know. I know.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.611
See, he wants

02:31.443 --> 02:32.611
belly work.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.071
He wants belly work.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.991
See him exposing his

02:34.154 --> 02:36.991
belly? He wanted me to...

02:37.074 --> 02:39.034
do belly work.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.034
I think he wanted to

02:37.074 --> 02:39.034
fucking jump on you

02:39.118 --> 02:40.661
and grab you

02:39.118 --> 02:40.661
by the throat,

02:39.118 --> 02:40.661
No...

02:40.744 --> 02:42.454
rip your fucking...

02:40.744 --> 02:42.454
He was saying, "Hey,

02:42.537 --> 02:45.332
I can tell that you

02:42.537 --> 02:45.332
do good belly work."

02:45.415 --> 02:47.292
"Meeko Lestat Ward".

02:48.376 --> 02:50.129
"Whiskers DiLuigi".

02:53.882 --> 02:56.384

02:56.468 --> 02:58.219

02:58.303 --> 03:00.514
"Gizmo Nas Romadi".

03:00.597 --> 03:02.057
There's a lizard

03:00.597 --> 03:02.057
under there, Bubs.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.308
"Benway Dulaney".

03:03.391 --> 03:04.601
Julian:

03:03.391 --> 03:04.601
Bubs, do we have to read off

03:04.685 --> 03:06.145
every fucking

03:04.685 --> 03:06.145
memorial plaque

03:06.227 --> 03:07.729
of kitties here, man?

03:06.227 --> 03:07.729
Yes.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.148
Come on!

03:07.813 --> 03:09.148
'Cause all

03:07.813 --> 03:09.148
these kitties,

03:09.230 --> 03:10.398
when they passed away,

03:10.482 --> 03:11.650
donations were made

03:11.733 --> 03:12.901
and that's what

03:11.733 --> 03:12.901
they're for.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.319
You know, cats are kind of cool

03:14.402 --> 03:15.863
and, you know, they're

03:14.402 --> 03:15.863
a little neat-looking,

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
but once you've seen

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
fucking ten of them,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.740
they all look the same,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.740
like snowflakes

03:18.824 --> 03:20.159
or rocks or tomatoes.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.409
It's fucked!

03:21.493 --> 03:22.870
Okay. Let's go.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.122
"Leo, Mr. Snudge,

03:22.953 --> 03:25.122
Smunny,

03:25.204 --> 03:27.248

03:27.332 --> 03:28.667
All right, we're done.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.753
(Whispering)

03:30.418 --> 03:31.753
Look.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.463
Decent, they're

03:31.837 --> 03:33.463
feeding 'em.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.132
Look at that, boys.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.134
Oh, yeah.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.134
Look, he's shaking him.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.011
Getting the flavour.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.011
He's got a lot of

03:37.217 --> 03:39.011
flavours on him.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.221
Sometimes they dip

03:39.094 --> 03:41.221
those kitties in...

03:41.304 --> 03:42.848
you know, they'll dip

03:41.304 --> 03:42.848
them in, like, a nice...

03:42.931 --> 03:45.517
flavoured sauce

03:42.931 --> 03:45.517
and put them in,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.144
so he's probably

03:45.600 --> 03:47.144
licking that off.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.854
They don't do

03:47.227 --> 03:48.854
that, do they?

03:48.937 --> 03:51.940
Oh, they dip them in,

03:48.937 --> 03:51.940
like, a barbecue sauce

03:48.937 --> 03:51.940
or whatever...

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
Oh, that's...

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
that's what they do

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
out in the wild, eh?

03:54.068 --> 03:55.861
Julian:

03:54.068 --> 03:55.861
Bubs, we've fucking seen

03:55.944 --> 03:57.404
almost every goddamn

03:55.944 --> 03:57.404
animal in here, man.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.074
I know.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.074
When's enough, huh?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.159
Right now is enough.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.159
Fuck, just wait.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.412
What?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.412
It's a feeding

04:02.242 --> 04:05.412
bucket, boys.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.247
That's a feeding bucket

04:05.495 --> 04:07.247
and a feeding stick.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.665
You're not going to

04:07.330 --> 04:08.665
fucking feed them!

04:08.749 --> 04:10.417
Why not?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.127
Why not?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.127
Well, it's dangerous.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.589
No, it's not, Ricky.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.589
I know how to feed kitties.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.882
Anybody around?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.882
There's nobody around.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.800
Nobody's around.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.800
Just feed 'em.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.428
Hurry up.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.428
I'm just going to

04:18.884 --> 04:21.428
pick up the stick.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.304
Not doing anything.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.182
Not doing anything,

04:23.388 --> 04:25.182
just... reach in

04:25.265 --> 04:27.517
and get myself

04:25.265 --> 04:27.517
a piece of meat.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.811
Here, who wants a

04:27.601 --> 04:29.811
nice piece of steak?

04:29.895 --> 04:32.147
Who wants a nice

04:29.895 --> 04:32.147
piece of steak?

04:32.231 --> 04:34.357
Yeah? Come on.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.357
Up! Up!

04:32.231 --> 04:34.357
(Groaning)

04:34.441 --> 04:37.111
See how high

04:34.441 --> 04:37.111
he can go.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.361
Ricky:

04:37.194 --> 04:38.361
Holy shit, man!

04:38.445 --> 04:40.114
Bubbles:

04:38.445 --> 04:40.114
(Laughing)

04:40.197 --> 04:42.199
Would he ever fuck

04:40.197 --> 04:42.199
you over, man.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.491
No, he wouldn't.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.119
I could walk in

04:43.575 --> 04:45.119
there right now

04:45.202 --> 04:47.162
and do belly

04:45.202 --> 04:47.162
work on him.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.162
You'd do that?

04:47.246 --> 04:48.413
Oh, there's someone

04:47.246 --> 04:48.413
coming down there.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.664
Hurry up.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.664
What? Oh, here.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.625
Come on, one more.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.625
Quick, quick.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.960
Twist 'er.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.960
All right.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.920
Pull it out.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.920
Trying.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.713
Wow, he's strong.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.713
Put it down.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.713
Let's go, let's go.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.465
His teeth are

04:56.797 --> 04:58.465
fucking strong.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.716
How was that?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.760
Holy fuck,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.760
I just fed a tiger!

05:01.843 --> 05:04.304
Holy fuck, that

05:01.843 --> 05:04.304
was awesome, boys!

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
You got to admit

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
that was awesome,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
come on.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.225
It was actually...

05:06.514 --> 05:08.225
Did you see me

05:06.514 --> 05:08.225
feeding him?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.269
it was pretty

05:08.308 --> 05:10.269
fucking cool.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.269
It was pretty cool, Bubs.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.479
Well, boys,

05:10.351 --> 05:12.479
I am proud to say

05:12.562 --> 05:15.190
I doled out maximum love

05:12.562 --> 05:15.190
to all those kitties.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.192
I feel great.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.027
Can we get something to

05:17.276 --> 05:19.027
fucking eat now, please?

05:19.111 --> 05:20.988
I feel like I have

05:19.111 --> 05:20.988
eat exhaust, for

05:19.111 --> 05:20.988
fuck's sakes.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.282
No time, Ricky.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.282
We got to get

05:21.071 --> 05:23.282
to the airport

05:23.364 --> 05:25.284
and get to Charlotte.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.284
So what does Swearnet

05:25.366 --> 05:26.910
have planned for us

05:25.366 --> 05:26.910
in Charlotte now?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.121
We won't know until

05:26.994 --> 05:29.121
we get to the hotel.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.538
All we got are

05:29.204 --> 05:30.538
the plane tickets.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.626
Wait, now.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.626
Bubs, what the fuck?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.377
This is a

05:34.709 --> 05:36.377
domestic flight.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.588
Why the fuck are

05:36.461 --> 05:38.588
we going there

05:36.461 --> 05:38.588
three hours early?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.048
'Cause I don't

05:38.672 --> 05:40.048
like to be rushed.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.300
You don't like

05:40.132 --> 05:41.300
to be rushed?

05:41.382 --> 05:43.468
Three fucking

05:41.382 --> 05:43.468
hours, man?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.220
Well, I like to

05:43.551 --> 05:45.220
take my time.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.680
We got to go

05:45.304 --> 05:46.680
through security.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.931
We get to the gate

05:46.763 --> 05:47.931
good and early

05:48.015 --> 05:49.183
and we get a good seat,

05:49.266 --> 05:50.517
and then we relax

05:49.266 --> 05:50.517
for a few hours,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.644
play solitaire.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.644
Hey, Dicky Nuts.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.644
Driver!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.313
Pull into the next

05:52.727 --> 05:54.313
fucking bar.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.939
Driver:

05:54.395 --> 05:55.939
I was told straight

05:54.395 --> 05:55.939
to the airport.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.149
I'm in charge right now!

05:57.232 --> 05:59.651
Pull into the

05:57.232 --> 05:59.651
next fucking bar!

05:59.734 --> 06:02.070
Fucking three

05:59.734 --> 06:02.070
fucking hours.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.947
We're going to be

06:02.154 --> 06:03.947
fucking late, you watch.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.199
We're not going to

06:04.031 --> 06:05.199
be fucking late.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.449
You watch.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.449
Yeah,<i> you</i> watch.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.993
We'll be rushing

06:06.533 --> 06:07.993
through security,

06:08.076 --> 06:09.911
running to the gate.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.206
Woman:

06:09.995 --> 06:12.206
Can I get you guys

06:09.995 --> 06:12.206
anything else?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.541
Do you have any,

06:12.289 --> 06:14.541
uh, weed or hash

06:14.624 --> 06:15.834
or oil or anything

06:14.624 --> 06:15.834
like that, do ya?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.294
Huh! No, sorry.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.795
Fuck!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.339
We're good. We're cool.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.339
Woman:

06:18.879 --> 06:20.339
Okay.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.590
(Whispering)

06:20.421 --> 06:22.590
Ricky, don't

06:20.421 --> 06:22.590
ask the lady

06:22.674 --> 06:23.842
if they've got

06:22.674 --> 06:23.842
weed or hash

06:23.925 --> 06:25.219
or oil,

06:23.925 --> 06:25.219
for fuck's sakes.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.304
How am I supposed

06:25.302 --> 06:27.304
to find it?

06:27.386 --> 06:29.223
Well...

06:27.386 --> 06:29.223
Guys, from this point on,

06:29.306 --> 06:31.099
we're all going to decide

06:29.306 --> 06:31.099
together, as a team,

06:31.183 --> 06:32.684
what the fuck

06:31.183 --> 06:32.684
we're going to do, okay?

06:32.767 --> 06:34.019
Julian, I've been

06:32.767 --> 06:34.019
dealing with Swearnet.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.896
Let's just leave it

06:34.102 --> 06:35.896
that way and I'll...

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
Bubs, bubs...

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
Just because you negotiated

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
some shit deal with

06:38.815 --> 06:41.860
Swearnet doesn't mean

06:38.815 --> 06:41.860
you get to dictate what

06:38.815 --> 06:41.860
we're all going to fucking do.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.362
I'm not dictating anything!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.364
Fucking right,

06:43.444 --> 06:45.364
you're dictating!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.364
I'm not!

06:45.446 --> 06:47.032
I'm just trying to

06:45.446 --> 06:47.032
keep us organized

06:47.115 --> 06:48.742
and get us to fucking

06:47.115 --> 06:48.742
Charlotte on time.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.577
Is that a crime?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.577
You know what?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.954
Fuck Charlotte,

06:50.660 --> 06:52.954
because I'm staying

06:50.660 --> 06:52.954
right here.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.040
What?

06:53.038 --> 06:55.040
It's going to be the

06:53.038 --> 06:55.040
same old bullshit.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.624
They're going to give

06:55.123 --> 06:56.624
us these stupid tasks

06:55.123 --> 06:56.624
we can't do.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.377
We're not going to

06:56.708 --> 06:58.377
get paid anyway.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.503
I'm staying right

06:58.459 --> 07:00.503
the fuck here and

06:58.459 --> 07:00.503
having a good time.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.297
You know what? Fuck it.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.297
I'm staying here, too.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.258
Right on, buddy. Here.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.258
You pick something.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.467
Guess what? I'll go

07:04.341 --> 07:06.467
to fucking Charlotte on my

07:04.341 --> 07:06.467
own. How do you like that?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.553
Be my guest. You're

07:06.551 --> 07:08.553
more than welcome

07:08.636 --> 07:11.723
to stay with us, but if you

07:08.636 --> 07:11.723
want to go to Charlotte by

07:08.636 --> 07:11.723
yourself, go for it.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.892
What do you want to do,

07:11.806 --> 07:13.892
Rick? Start time to have

07:11.806 --> 07:13.892
some fun, man.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.643
Oh my fuck!

07:15.727 --> 07:17.145
Check it out, boys!

07:17.229 --> 07:19.981
I've been getting dreamt

07:17.229 --> 07:19.981
my whole fucking life...

07:20.065 --> 07:22.192
fighting a shark

07:20.065 --> 07:22.192
or beating the tits

07:20.065 --> 07:22.192
off a bear...

07:22.276 --> 07:24.403
or wrestling a fucking

07:22.276 --> 07:24.403
al-i-ga-tor...

07:24.485 --> 07:26.196
And look,

07:24.485 --> 07:26.196
al-i-ga-tor wrestling.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.697
Yeah, here we go.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.697
Right on.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.949
Here we fucking go.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.949
I'll kick the fuck

07:29.032 --> 07:30.533
outta one of

07:29.032 --> 07:30.533
these things!

07:30.617 --> 07:32.160
You're wrestling

07:30.617 --> 07:32.160
an alligator, buddy.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.160
Yes!

07:32.244 --> 07:34.037
And you know what?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.037
This is what

07:32.244 --> 07:34.037
I'm going to do.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.248
And like I said, Bubs,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.248
you're more than welcome

07:34.121 --> 07:36.248
to stay with us,

07:36.331 --> 07:38.583
but if you got to

07:36.331 --> 07:38.583
go to Charlotte,

07:36.331 --> 07:38.583
on your own,

07:38.666 --> 07:41.002
go for it, buddy.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.002
You, just two

07:38.666 --> 07:41.002
seconds ago said

07:41.086 --> 07:42.837
we're all going to

07:41.086 --> 07:42.837
decide, as a team,

07:42.921 --> 07:44.923
what we're going to do, and

07:42.921 --> 07:44.923
now you just fucking decided...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.258
Yeah, well, I'm deciding

07:46.341 --> 07:47.884
we're going to

07:46.341 --> 07:47.884
have fun, okay?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.344
All right, let's go

07:47.968 --> 07:49.344
wrestle an alligator, man.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.804
Yeah!

07:50.887 --> 07:53.181
Well, just hang

07:50.887 --> 07:53.181
the fuck on here.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
You're really

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
going to just take off

07:55.434 --> 07:56.601
and leave me here

07:55.434 --> 07:56.601
just like that?

07:56.684 --> 07:57.894
You're not going

07:56.684 --> 07:57.894
to eat that?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.729
Bubs, we're not

07:57.978 --> 07:59.729
taking off on you.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.606
You're taking off

07:59.813 --> 08:01.606
on us.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.109
We want to stay.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.109
Have fun, buddy.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.486
Just hang on.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.486
I can't miss this, Bubs.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.029
Love you, buddy.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.948
Julian, are you going to

08:08.113 --> 08:09.948
fucking supervise him

08:10.031 --> 08:11.825
or are you just going to

08:10.031 --> 08:11.825
let him fucking run wild

08:11.908 --> 08:14.369
into an alligator park

08:11.908 --> 08:14.369
and get himself eaten?

08:14.453 --> 08:17.080
Bubs, this is something

08:14.453 --> 08:17.080
he's wanted to do

08:14.453 --> 08:17.080
his whole life, okay?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.873
If he wants to do it,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.873
he's going to do it.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.708
He's a grown man.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.708
Take her easy, man.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.876
Just...

08:20.792 --> 08:21.876
(Frustrated sigh)

08:21.960 --> 08:24.879
You're such

08:21.960 --> 08:24.879
a fucking asshole.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.714
I'm staying and

08:24.963 --> 08:26.714
I have no choice now.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.258
You'll just

08:26.798 --> 08:28.258
let Ricky die.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.968
I'm not going

08:28.342 --> 08:29.968
to let him die.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.511
I'm going to let him

08:30.051 --> 08:31.511
have some fun.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.930
That's what I'm doing.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.432
You're an asshole,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.432
Julian.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.683
Julian:

08:35.515 --> 08:36.683
You're a bigger

08:35.515 --> 08:36.683
asshole.

08:38.435 --> 08:39.853
Ricky:

08:38.435 --> 08:39.853
(Excited exhalation)

08:39.936 --> 08:41.396
This is going to be

08:39.936 --> 08:41.396
fucking awesome, boys.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.439
I'm fighting the biggest,

08:41.480 --> 08:42.439
ugliest fucking

08:42.563 --> 08:44.149
al-i-ga-tor they got.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.943
Ricky, why don't

08:44.232 --> 08:46.943
you start off,

08:44.232 --> 08:46.943
maybe, with a tiny...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.945
Start off with some

08:47.027 --> 08:48.945
little pussy and

08:47.027 --> 08:48.945
tire myself out?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.655
And he'll go back

08:49.029 --> 08:50.655
and tell all

08:49.029 --> 08:50.655
the other 'gators

08:50.738 --> 08:52.199
my fucking moves.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.199
It's just like being

08:50.738 --> 08:52.199
in jail, Bubs.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.741
You want respect?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.327
Go after the biggest

08:53.825 --> 08:55.327
fucking asshole

08:53.825 --> 08:55.327
you can find.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.245
That's what you do

08:55.410 --> 08:57.245
in jail, is it?

08:57.329 --> 08:58.955
Look for the biggest asshole?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.748
That's the son

08:59.039 --> 09:00.748
of a bitch I'm

08:59.039 --> 09:00.748
fighting right there.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.626
You're going down,

09:00.832 --> 09:03.626
you little scaly fuck!

09:03.710 --> 09:06.921
Bubbles:

09:03.710 --> 09:06.921
Ricky, that fucking

09:03.710 --> 09:06.921
thing's 15 feet long.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.299
You can't fight that.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.299
No, you sucker-punch 'em.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.302
That's how you

09:09.383 --> 09:12.302
fucking start an

09:09.383 --> 09:12.302
al-i-ga-tor fight.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.429
He's going to get

09:12.386 --> 09:14.429
fucking killed.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.429
He's fucked.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.351
Pretty.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.351
Are you my good boy?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.144
(Exhalation)

09:21.228 --> 09:23.188
Jesus, look at the size

09:21.228 --> 09:23.188
of those fucking things.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.772
These little pussies.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.067
Man:

09:24.856 --> 09:27.067
Well, g'day, mates!

09:27.150 --> 09:30.653
You ready for some

09:27.150 --> 09:30.653
danger, danger, danger?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
How's it going,

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
Alligator Dundee?

09:32.364 --> 09:34.032
Man:

09:32.364 --> 09:34.032
Good, good. Wait,

09:32.364 --> 09:34.032
what are you doing?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.200
Ricky!

09:34.115 --> 09:35.200
Stop! You can't...

09:35.283 --> 09:36.701
There's alligators

09:35.283 --> 09:36.701
out here!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.161
How do I get in

09:36.784 --> 09:38.161
the pen over there

09:38.245 --> 09:39.579
with big bastard?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.579
I want to fight him.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.456
Ha! Mr. Chopper?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.456
Yeah.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.124
Mr. Chopper has killed

09:43.208 --> 09:45.585
17 other alligators.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.836
You will die.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.713
You won't... you

09:46.920 --> 09:48.713
won't just get hurt,

09:48.796 --> 09:50.006
you will die.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.299
Your buddies will be

09:50.090 --> 09:51.299
bringing you back

09:51.383 --> 09:53.218
in a body bag.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.218
There you go, Ricky.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.054
That's enough of

09:53.301 --> 09:56.054
that. You're not

09:53.301 --> 09:56.054
fighting that big one.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.515
I can't fight one

09:56.137 --> 09:58.515
of these little guys

09:56.137 --> 09:58.515
like a fucking kid would fight.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.268
I want to fight a big bastard

09:58.598 --> 10:01.268
like Tarzlan would fight

09:58.598 --> 10:01.268
in the foreverglades.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.186
Rick, is this going to

10:01.351 --> 10:03.186
happen or what?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.812
Boys, this wasn't my dream.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.981
I may as well fight a salmon

10:04.896 --> 10:06.981
or a trout back home.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.400
Just as exciting

10:07.065 --> 10:08.400
as this shit.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.151
Ricky, fighting a salmon

10:08.483 --> 10:10.151
is not the same

10:10.235 --> 10:11.694
as fighting one of those!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.154
If you're going to fight it,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.154
fight it.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.406
If not, let's get

10:13.238 --> 10:14.406
the fuck outta here.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.656
I don't even like it here.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.034
Boys, I'm not a bully.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.912
This would be like

10:18.118 --> 10:20.912
fighting fucking Cory.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.789
Maybe if I fight five

10:20.995 --> 10:22.789
of them at once, like...

10:22.872 --> 10:24.207
Okay, you five, right here.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.207
Let's go.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.750
C'mon up.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.377
Sucker bite me, I don't care.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.377
Come on up.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.712
Bubbles:

10:27.461 --> 10:29.712
Ricky!

10:29.796 --> 10:32.257
Okay, look, they

10:29.796 --> 10:32.257
don't want any

10:29.796 --> 10:32.257
piece of you.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.633
They don't

10:32.340 --> 10:33.633
want it, Ricky.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
They're backing down.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
Let's go.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.887
Ricky:

10:35.802 --> 10:37.887
Any of you.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.847
Bubbles:

10:37.971 --> 10:39.847
They don't want it, Ricky,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.847
they're scared of you.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.349
Come on, you,

10:39.931 --> 10:41.349
you're pretty big.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.143
I'll let you sucker

10:41.433 --> 10:43.143
bite me, come on up.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.313
Bubbles:

10:45.103 --> 10:46.313
Come on, get

10:45.103 --> 10:46.313
out of there.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.357
My fucking dream

10:46.396 --> 10:49.357
my whole life.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.650
I can't fight these

10:49.441 --> 10:50.650
little pussies.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.487
Fuck you. Fuck you.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.487
Fuck off.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.405
This fucking sucks, boys.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.656
Bubbles:

10:55.489 --> 10:56.656
Come on, Ricky.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.159
Life long dreamt,

10:56.739 --> 10:59.159
fucking gone.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.410
Okay, well, you

10:59.242 --> 11:00.410
had your chance.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.661
Let's go.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.539
Ricky, why are

11:03.163 --> 11:04.539
you looking at

11:03.163 --> 11:04.539
it like that?

11:04.623 --> 11:05.999
Think about it.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.960
You just challenged

11:06.082 --> 11:08.960
a whole gang of 'gators,

11:09.043 --> 11:11.296
called them on and

11:09.043 --> 11:11.296
they fucking didn't

11:09.043 --> 11:11.296
go at you.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.589
You're right, Bubs.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.923
They're fucking

11:12.671 --> 11:13.923
ascared of me!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.842
Big time.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.842
Fucking al-i-ga-tors

11:15.925 --> 11:17.760
are fucking

11:15.925 --> 11:17.760
ascared of me.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.555
Exactly. So that's

11:17.844 --> 11:20.555
better bragging rights

11:20.639 --> 11:21.806
than saying you

11:20.639 --> 11:21.806
fought a big one.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.308
You challenged

11:21.889 --> 11:23.308
a whole gang.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.725
That's right.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.725
Fuck all of you!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.978
Let's go have

11:24.809 --> 11:26.978
some fun. Come on.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.939
Come on. I think it's

11:27.061 --> 11:29.939
way better this way.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.274
You know,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.274
they back down

11:31.358 --> 11:32.526
and you don't get bit.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.196
Julian:

11:34.819 --> 11:36.196
We're almost there, boys.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.780
Holy fuck, this is

11:36.279 --> 11:37.780
going to be awesome!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.407
Where the fuck

11:37.864 --> 11:39.407
are we headed?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.826
I'm not telling you,

11:39.491 --> 11:41.826
man, it's a surprise.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.287
Just tell us, Julian.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.287
What's the big deal?

11:41.909 --> 11:44.287
Nope.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.373
It's probably

11:44.371 --> 11:46.373
going to suck donkey

11:44.371 --> 11:46.373
tits, anyway.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.291
It's definitely not

11:46.456 --> 11:48.291
going to suck, man.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.418
I've been wanting

11:48.375 --> 11:50.418
to do this my

11:48.375 --> 11:50.418
entire fucking life.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.710
Oh yeah?

11:50.502 --> 11:51.710
Where we going?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.672
To a fucking...

11:51.794 --> 11:53.672
all-male nude gym?

11:53.754 --> 11:54.922
(Mixed laughter)

11:53.754 --> 11:54.922
Ha, ha, ha,

11:55.006 --> 11:56.508
real funny.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.301
Oh, wait, I know where

11:56.591 --> 11:58.301
you're going, Julian.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.636
I know where

11:58.385 --> 11:59.636
you're going.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.095
You're going to be

11:59.718 --> 12:01.095
Patrick Swayze

12:01.179 --> 12:02.972
in a Roadhouse virtual

12:01.179 --> 12:02.972
reality experience.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.307
Fuck you, Bubs.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.307
(Laughing)

12:04.391 --> 12:05.642
We're going to the

12:04.391 --> 12:05.642
muscle bump factory!

12:05.724 --> 12:07.268
Yeah, that's

12:05.724 --> 12:07.268
where we're going.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.937
No! No, we're going to

12:07.352 --> 12:09.937
Arnold Schwarzenegger's house

12:10.021 --> 12:11.523
and he's going to get

12:10.021 --> 12:11.523
to oil him up

12:11.606 --> 12:13.525
and play with his tits.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.525
(Laughing)

12:13.608 --> 12:15.943
What the fuck is wrong

12:13.608 --> 12:15.943
with your brain?

12:16.027 --> 12:17.487
I don't want to

12:16.027 --> 12:17.487
fucking do that.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.779
Well, I'm not going

12:17.571 --> 12:18.779
unless you tell us.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.240
All right, no problem.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.200
Driver, pull over and

12:20.323 --> 12:22.200
let these dicks out.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
No, no, no,

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
keep going.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.953
We've come this far,

12:26.037 --> 12:28.206
I want to see

12:26.037 --> 12:28.206
what it is you

12:26.037 --> 12:28.206
want to do now.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.381
Fuck. We need to...

12:33.545 --> 12:36.381
we got to pull over to

12:33.545 --> 12:36.381
a fucking gas station

12:36.464 --> 12:37.798
or a convenience

12:36.464 --> 12:37.798
store, like,<i> now.</i>

12:37.882 --> 12:39.467
We're not pulling over.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.219
We're fucking

12:39.551 --> 12:41.219
running late here.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.219
We have to.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.638
Ricky, what's wrong?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.638
You look like

12:41.302 --> 12:43.638
you saw a ghost.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.015
I... I got this

12:43.722 --> 12:46.015
fucking cold

12:43.722 --> 12:46.015
coming on.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.475
If I don't blow

12:46.099 --> 12:47.475
my nose now,

12:47.559 --> 12:49.310
it's going to spray it

12:47.559 --> 12:49.310
all over the place.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.730
Blow your nose?

12:49.394 --> 12:51.730
Ricky, blow your

12:49.394 --> 12:51.730
nose on the carpet,

12:51.812 --> 12:54.232
scuff it in with

12:51.812 --> 12:54.232
your foot like

12:51.812 --> 12:54.232
you'd normally do.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.110
Well, I do have to do that,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.110
but I have to also piss.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.154
Bubbles:

12:58.528 --> 13:00.154
You don't have to piss.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
I can tell by looking at you,

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
you don't have to piss.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.324
Okay, I'm going to shit myself!

13:03.408 --> 13:04.576
Is that what you

13:03.408 --> 13:04.576
want me to say?

13:04.659 --> 13:05.993
I just need to

13:04.659 --> 13:05.993
fucking pull over

13:06.077 --> 13:07.245
to a gas station or

13:06.077 --> 13:07.245
a convenience store!

13:07.328 --> 13:08.496
I got pressure here!

13:08.580 --> 13:10.498
It's going to fucking

13:08.580 --> 13:10.498
explode and...

13:10.582 --> 13:13.084
shit's going to fly around.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.084
Are you serious

13:10.582 --> 13:13.084
right now?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
What do you think?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
Do you want to

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
take a chance?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.880
Driver, pull over.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.880
Pull over to this fucking

13:15.253 --> 13:17.880
gas station up here.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.091
Pull over, Ricky's

13:17.964 --> 13:20.091
going to shit hisself.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.676
Thanks, Julian.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.676
Just hold on.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
Let's go, Julian.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
I need your fucking

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
credit card, man.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.389
What do you need

13:25.221 --> 13:26.389
my credit card for?

13:26.473 --> 13:27.806
I want to buy some

13:26.473 --> 13:27.806
lighter fluid.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.058
I got a lighter

13:27.890 --> 13:29.058
in the bag.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.851
Julian, I really,

13:29.142 --> 13:30.851
really, need to buy

13:30.935 --> 13:33.020
some fucking

13:30.935 --> 13:33.020
lighter fluid here.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.020
(Scoffing)

13:33.104 --> 13:34.397
Ricky, what's

13:33.104 --> 13:34.397
going on here?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.649
Why are you digging

13:34.481 --> 13:35.649
at your unit?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.900
I'm not really, am I?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.111
Yes, you are. And your

13:37.984 --> 13:40.111
eyes are fucking blinking

13:40.194 --> 13:41.904
and darting around

13:40.194 --> 13:41.904
100 miles an hour.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.281
I don't know what

13:41.988 --> 13:43.281
is causing all that...

13:43.364 --> 13:45.908
Ricky, what is going on?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.619
Fuck! Okay.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.579
I didn't want to

13:47.702 --> 13:49.579
make a big deal

13:47.702 --> 13:49.579
about it, all right?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.623
(Sigh)

13:49.663 --> 13:51.623
You guys are probably

13:49.663 --> 13:51.623
going to tease me,

13:51.706 --> 13:53.916
but I've got fucking

13:51.706 --> 13:53.916
alligator fleas.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.669
Alligator fleas?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.420
Ricky, alligators

13:55.752 --> 13:57.420
don't have fleas,

13:57.504 --> 13:58.963
they're fucking

13:57.504 --> 13:58.963
dinosaurs.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.465
Well, I must have got 'em

13:59.046 --> 14:00.465
from the fucking tigers,

14:00.548 --> 14:02.883
I don't know! I've got

14:00.548 --> 14:02.883
fucking fleas! Look!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.761
What the fuck is that?

14:04.843 --> 14:06.680
Oh my fuck.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.680
What? What is it?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.931
Look at it, Ricky.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.931
It's got little pinchers.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.475
Oh, no, no, no.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.475
He's got crabs.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.310
(Loud whisper)

14:10.558 --> 14:12.310
You got crabs!

14:12.393 --> 14:14.646
Only got a few of

14:12.393 --> 14:14.646
them... Did we go to

14:12.393 --> 14:14.646
fucking the beach

14:14.729 --> 14:16.897
without me knowing

14:14.729 --> 14:16.897
about it or something?

14:14.729 --> 14:16.897
You must have got it

14:16.981 --> 14:18.608
from that dirty old

14:16.981 --> 14:18.608
load bed you slept in.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.943
Fuck. That

14:18.692 --> 14:20.943
fucking asshole!

14:18.692 --> 14:20.943
Okay, boys,

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
we're going to a pharmacy

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
right the fuck now.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.280
Let's go.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.280
Oh, yeah?

14:22.903 --> 14:24.280
Who's going to buy it?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
I'm not, it's a fucking

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
embarrassing.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.241
Well, somebody's

14:25.615 --> 14:27.241
buying it!

14:27.325 --> 14:29.160
'Cause I'm not travelling

14:27.325 --> 14:29.160
around in a confined

14:27.325 --> 14:29.160
space with you

14:29.243 --> 14:30.995
as those things

14:29.243 --> 14:30.995
are multiplying.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.995
Fuck.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.331
You won't have to. Why

14:31.078 --> 14:33.331
the fuck do you think

14:31.078 --> 14:33.331
I need lighter fluid?

14:33.414 --> 14:35.291
Lighter... What

14:33.414 --> 14:35.291
the fuck do you need

14:33.414 --> 14:35.291
lighter fluid for?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
No one had fucking

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
crabs more times

14:37.293 --> 14:39.045
in the fucking history of

14:37.293 --> 14:39.045
the world than my old man.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.714
He never bought the shampoo,

14:39.128 --> 14:40.714
he always used lighter fluid.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.382
He said it works great.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.967
Give me your

14:42.465 --> 14:44.967
fucking credit card!

14:42.465 --> 14:44.967
I'm dying here!

14:45.051 --> 14:46.594
Give it to him.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.594
Hurry up! Hurry up!

14:46.678 --> 14:49.514
Fuck's sakes.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.514
Come on, Ricky.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.516
Julian, I am not

14:49.597 --> 14:51.516
travelling around

14:51.599 --> 14:53.560
with a bunch of dirty little

14:51.599 --> 14:53.560
fucking cock-pinching...

14:53.643 --> 14:55.019
You think I want to?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.771
...fucking bird-hitchhikers.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.981
Is there any on me?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.981
I don't...

14:59.065 --> 15:01.108
What do I got, fucking

14:59.065 --> 15:01.108
crab laser vision?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.861
I can just spot them

15:01.192 --> 15:02.861
from 15 feet?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.861
Well... Here, look.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.279
Okay, you're clear,

15:02.943 --> 15:05.279
I'm clear. We're good.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.657
It's almost impossible

15:05.363 --> 15:07.657
to rationalize with someone

15:07.741 --> 15:10.076
that thinks that fucking

15:07.741 --> 15:10.076
alligators can get fleas,

15:07.741 --> 15:10.076
for fuck's sakes.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.619
Well, it's impossible

15:10.159 --> 15:11.619
to rationalize with him

15:11.703 --> 15:13.037
because he's got

15:11.703 --> 15:13.037
Ray as a father.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.622
Ray is the problem.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.041
Ray is like Ivory soap,

15:14.706 --> 15:17.041
except the opposite.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.127
He's, like, 99 and 3/4 %

15:17.124 --> 15:20.127
bullshit,

15:20.211 --> 15:23.089
1/4 % sort of makes

15:20.211 --> 15:23.089
sense some of the time.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.299
Sometimes.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.299
So let's just hope

15:23.172 --> 15:25.299
that, you know,

15:25.383 --> 15:27.468
this whole lighter

15:25.383 --> 15:27.468
fluid on the package

15:27.552 --> 15:30.221
fits into the

15:27.552 --> 15:30.221
1/4 % category.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.682
Fuck, I hate crabs!

15:30.304 --> 15:32.682
Fuck.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
Julian, I'm not fucking

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
happy about this.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.310
Like, what are

15:34.809 --> 15:36.310
we going to do here?

15:36.394 --> 15:38.396
I'm not going to be

15:36.394 --> 15:38.396
able to sleep,

15:36.394 --> 15:38.396
first of all.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
I'm going to... every

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
minute I'm going to think

15:40.440 --> 15:41.733
Just, just...

15:40.440 --> 15:41.733
there's something

15:40.440 --> 15:41.733
crawling on me.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.276
I already feel weird.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.276
Just check yourself out.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.152
Have a few drinks tonight.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.152
I'm already feeling...

15:45.236 --> 15:47.196
What the... Did you buy

15:45.236 --> 15:47.196
half the fucking store?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
How much did you spend

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
on my credit card?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.700
Who gives a fuck?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.700
It's basically free money.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.620
It's not free,

15:50.784 --> 15:53.620
you dummy, I got to

15:50.784 --> 15:53.620
pay it back!

15:53.703 --> 15:54.913
I want to beg

15:53.703 --> 15:54.913
to be different.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.956
Julian:

15:54.995 --> 15:56.956
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.459
Ricky, so you're

15:57.039 --> 15:59.459
just putting a raw

15:57.039 --> 15:59.459
petroleum product

15:59.542 --> 16:02.796
right directly on

15:59.542 --> 16:02.796
your wiener skin?

15:59.542 --> 16:02.796
Yep.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.672
Sorry about that,

16:02.879 --> 16:04.672
he's just...

16:04.756 --> 16:06.006
He's not right

16:04.756 --> 16:06.006
in the head.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.300
Doesn't that burn?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.760
No, it actually

16:07.383 --> 16:08.760
feels really good.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.428
It's kinda cooly.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.428
And then like magic,

16:10.511 --> 16:12.597
it just evacuates

16:10.511 --> 16:12.597
into thick air.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.891
(Liquid squirting)

16:12.680 --> 16:14.891
Bye-bye,

16:12.680 --> 16:14.891
you little fuckers.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.184
Fuck you!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.184
And fuck you!

16:17.268 --> 16:19.270
All right,

16:17.268 --> 16:19.270
are we done?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.270
For now.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.688
Okay, everybody in the

16:19.353 --> 16:20.688
van. Let's go before

16:20.772 --> 16:22.022
this fucking place closes.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.441
I got some cool

16:22.106 --> 16:23.441
stuff, eh, Bubs?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.192
What did you get?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.192
It's pretty nice.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.069
Holy fuck!

16:27.153 --> 16:28.863
Jumbo bowl

16:27.153 --> 16:28.863
of peanuts!

16:31.031 --> 16:32.241
Ja-lapenos!

16:32.325 --> 16:35.995
(Engines revving)

16:36.078 --> 16:37.622
Oh, my fuck, Julian!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.499
How fucking hard

16:37.705 --> 16:39.499
are you right now?

16:39.582 --> 16:40.750
I'm not going to lie, bud.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.502
I'm fully erect.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.086
Let's go throw

16:42.585 --> 16:44.086
my credit card down

16:44.170 --> 16:46.046
and see what the fuck

16:44.170 --> 16:46.046
these things can do.

16:48.466 --> 16:49.634
Bubbles:

16:48.466 --> 16:49.634
He's got a troner.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.678
A what?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.678
A truck boner.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.554
(Laughing)

16:53.638 --> 16:55.222
Right on!

16:53.638 --> 16:55.222
Here you go.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.391
Let's get this

16:55.306 --> 16:57.391
fucking going!

16:55.306 --> 16:57.391
All right.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.852
Let's go,

16:57.475 --> 16:58.852
commander.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.852
Holy fuck!

16:58.935 --> 17:00.520
Bubbles: (Whispering)

16:58.935 --> 17:00.520
Astronaut.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.188
Boys, this is going to

17:00.603 --> 17:02.188
be fucking awesome!

17:02.271 --> 17:03.773
Bubbles:

17:02.271 --> 17:03.773
Watch you don't

17:02.271 --> 17:03.773
bend your troner

17:03.857 --> 17:05.692
on the wheel there.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.692
Just get the fuck in, man!

17:08.194 --> 17:12.573
(Truck rattling)

17:15.284 --> 17:16.452
Right, Julian,

17:15.284 --> 17:16.452
right on!

17:16.536 --> 17:17.745
Yeah!

17:20.748 --> 17:21.916
Christ!

17:25.003 --> 17:27.005
Boys, this is

17:25.003 --> 17:27.005
fucking incredible.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.048
Bubbles:

17:27.087 --> 17:29.048
That ain't the trail.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.675
I don't fucking

17:29.131 --> 17:30.675
know, man.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.011
This thing doesn't

17:30.758 --> 17:33.011
need a trail.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.137
Jesus Murphy!

17:35.221 --> 17:37.139
I got to fucking get

17:35.221 --> 17:37.139
one of these, Julian.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.892
Julian:

17:37.223 --> 17:38.892
Fucking right.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.977
You don't need

17:38.975 --> 17:40.977
one of these, Ricky.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.772
Hang on, boys.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.772
This is a fucking

17:41.060 --> 17:44.772
good one here, boys.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.691
(Crashing)

17:44.856 --> 17:46.691
Holy fuck, boys!

17:46.774 --> 17:47.775
Hang on.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.486
Julian & Ricky:

17:47.859 --> 17:50.486
(Laughter)

17:50.570 --> 17:52.154
Whoo!

17:50.570 --> 17:52.154
Okay.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.823
Bubbles:

17:52.238 --> 17:53.823
Julian's out there,

17:53.907 --> 17:55.491
wrecking around

17:53.907 --> 17:55.491
in that big, goofy truck

17:55.575 --> 17:56.951
thinking he's some kind of

17:55.575 --> 17:56.951
muscular Evel Knievel,

17:57.035 --> 17:58.661
but he's not.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.581
He's just some fucking

17:58.745 --> 18:01.581
drunk guy with no skills.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.958
So, yes, I might have

18:01.664 --> 18:03.958
been a little bit scared.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.588
Right on, Ricky!

18:05.752 --> 18:08.588
This is awesome, boys!

18:08.671 --> 18:10.882
(Truck rattling)

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
Julian:

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
Right on, buddy!

18:19.223 --> 18:21.392
Hold it fucking

18:19.223 --> 18:21.392
steady, Ricky!

18:21.475 --> 18:22.810
Ricky:

18:21.475 --> 18:22.810
You got it man, you got it.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
Jesus Murphy!

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
This is awesome!

18:25.145 --> 18:27.398
Bubbles:

18:25.145 --> 18:27.398
Ricky, you're all

18:25.145 --> 18:27.398
over the fucking road.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.612
Nice one, buddy.

18:32.695 --> 18:33.905
Yeah-h-h!

18:33.988 --> 18:35.782
Julian:

18:33.988 --> 18:35.782
Okay, Bubs, you're next, bud!

18:35.865 --> 18:37.116
Bubbles:

18:35.865 --> 18:37.116
Yeah, you fucking...

18:37.199 --> 18:39.702
You wait and see

18:37.199 --> 18:39.702
what I do, baby.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.958
Okay, boys, do you have

18:42.371 --> 18:44.958
your seat belts on?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.251
Yeah, we're good, Bubs.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.251
We're on... we're on.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.087
You got this, buddy.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.087
Make sure they're...

18:49.420 --> 18:50.964
Oh no, I can...

18:49.420 --> 18:50.964
Don't worry, I've got her.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.715
Rev the piss

18:51.047 --> 18:52.715
outta this, man.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.341
I'm going to.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.341
Scare the fuck

18:52.799 --> 18:54.341
out of us, Bubs!

18:54.425 --> 18:56.260
I'm going to,

18:54.425 --> 18:56.260
you fucking wait.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.889
Okay, so...

18:56.343 --> 18:59.889
Here we go.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.224
Come on, Bubs, give it!

18:59.973 --> 19:02.224
That's pretty good.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.935
Give it to her!

19:02.308 --> 19:03.935
I'm giving it to her.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.813
Pretty good...

19:04.685 --> 19:06.813
Give her more

19:04.685 --> 19:06.813
gas, buddy.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.107
Well, Julian, I need

19:06.896 --> 19:09.107
to see what's coming.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.860
I'm just very careful.

19:12.944 --> 19:16.489
Bubs, you can go a

19:12.944 --> 19:16.489
lot faster than this.

19:12.944 --> 19:16.489
Just very careful there.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.074
Okay, there.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.451
Where's it go? Left?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.451
Left.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.451
Left, Bubs.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.495
Okay, well,

19:20.534 --> 19:22.495
it's hard to see, boys.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.455
Bubs, you don't

19:22.578 --> 19:24.455
got to put on your

19:22.578 --> 19:24.455
blinker, man.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.667
(Turn signal clicking)

19:24.538 --> 19:27.667
I want to use

19:24.538 --> 19:27.667
my blinker.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.251
Okay, now, is

19:27.750 --> 19:29.251
this the track?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.920
Julian:

19:29.335 --> 19:30.920
Yeah, you're good.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.755
Bubbles:

19:31.004 --> 19:32.755
Just like that?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.799
Bubs, this thing's made to go

19:32.839 --> 19:34.799
way faster than this, man.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.843
Well, the track

19:34.882 --> 19:36.843
is all one colour.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.136
It's hard to tell.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.553
Boys, I flew a fucking

19:38.218 --> 19:39.553
space shuttle.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.930
I think I can...

19:41.014 --> 19:43.683
drive a fucking Hummer

19:41.014 --> 19:43.683
just perfectly fine.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.893
Julian:

19:43.766 --> 19:45.893
Who the fuck gets behind

19:43.766 --> 19:45.893
the wheel of a Hummer,

19:45.977 --> 19:47.269
goes to 20 km an hour,

19:47.353 --> 19:49.271
using blinkers and

19:47.353 --> 19:49.271
shit, on a track?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.690
I know, it's ridiculous.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.690
I mean, those things

19:50.773 --> 19:52.108
are built to have their

19:50.773 --> 19:52.108
fucking bag blown off

19:52.191 --> 19:53.359
and he's driving around

19:52.191 --> 19:53.359
like a little pussy.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.319
And he wants

19:53.442 --> 19:55.319
to go to space.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.319
Yeah.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.072
I mean, a fucking rocket's

19:55.402 --> 19:58.072
going to be way scarier

19:55.402 --> 19:58.072
than a goddamn Hummer.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.199
Fucking right

19:58.156 --> 20:00.199
it is, man.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.199
Fuck.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.742
Bubbles:

20:00.282 --> 20:01.742
Where's the track?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.119
Ricky:

20:01.826 --> 20:03.119
You're doing great, man.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.578
Bubbles:

20:03.202 --> 20:04.578
Is this the track I'm on?

20:04.662 --> 20:05.872
Ricky:

20:04.662 --> 20:05.872
You're off the track.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.331
Bubbles:

20:05.955 --> 20:07.331
Okay. Holy fuck, I hit some...

20:07.414 --> 20:08.833
Keep it out of the

20:07.414 --> 20:08.833
fucking bushes, man.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.918
I'm sorry, I...

20:08.916 --> 20:10.918
I'm trying to see.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.962
Okay, now...

20:11.002 --> 20:12.962
You don't got to stop.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.297
Is there anything

20:13.046 --> 20:15.297
coming? Where do I go?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.297
Here...

20:15.381 --> 20:16.883
Bubbles:

20:15.381 --> 20:16.883
Cross here, maybe?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.342
Here we go.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.887
Oh, I can see this

20:18.425 --> 20:20.887
road much better.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.221
Julian:

20:20.970 --> 20:22.221
This road's not

20:20.970 --> 20:22.221
part of the track.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.723
It's a road.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.474
Bubbles:

20:23.806 --> 20:25.474
Is anything coming

20:23.806 --> 20:25.474
there, boys?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.185
No?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.185
Where's my blinker at?

20:27.267 --> 20:28.561
Here we go.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.561
(Mixed chatter)

20:28.644 --> 20:30.104
You don't need a fucking

20:28.644 --> 20:30.104
blinker, Bubs.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.772
Just take a right.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.772
Bubbles:

20:30.188 --> 20:31.772
Down here?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.524
Where am I going?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.524
Down here.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.777
Bubbles:

20:33.607 --> 20:36.777
Down this way?

20:33.607 --> 20:36.777
Nothing coming?

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
Julian:

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
No, there's nothing coming.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.490
Here, I got to

20:38.946 --> 20:41.490
check my mirrors.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.450
Where's my mirror at?

20:43.534 --> 20:45.745
You don't need

20:43.534 --> 20:45.745
a fucking mirror, Bubs.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.247
Bubbles:

20:45.828 --> 20:48.247
I think that's...

20:48.330 --> 20:51.792
Pretty good right there,

20:48.330 --> 20:51.792
wouldn't you say?

20:51.876 --> 20:52.877
Julian:

20:51.876 --> 20:52.877
Yeah.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.088
Ricky:

20:53.586 --> 20:55.088
That was fucking

20:53.586 --> 20:55.088
awesome, Julian.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.798
Boys, that was the

20:55.171 --> 20:57.798
best time of my life.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.009
Thank you.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.009
That was pretty fucking

20:57.882 --> 21:00.009
crazy, I must say.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.844
That was crazier than

21:00.093 --> 21:01.844
I thought it would be.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.055
Fuck, we were

21:01.928 --> 21:04.055
flying!

21:04.138 --> 21:06.306
Well, me and

21:04.138 --> 21:06.306
Julian were.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.306
You weren't really.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.392
You were like

21:06.390 --> 21:08.392
a scaredy-scaredy

21:06.390 --> 21:08.392
bawk bawk chicken.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.727
Peck! Peck!

21:09.810 --> 21:11.395
Peck! Peck! Peck!

21:11.478 --> 21:12.688
Peck! Peck! Peck!

21:11.478 --> 21:12.688
You were a bit

21:11.478 --> 21:12.688
scared, man.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.232
I wasn't scared.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.232
Scared!

21:14.356 --> 21:16.776
What are you

21:14.356 --> 21:16.776
talking about?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.776
I was doing it fast.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.237
I just like to be

21:16.859 --> 21:19.237
safe, that's all.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.530
If you pussy out

21:19.319 --> 21:21.530
like that in a

21:19.319 --> 21:21.530
space ship, man,

21:21.614 --> 21:22.865
you're going to

21:21.614 --> 21:22.865
fucking die. Okay?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.283
Just remember that.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.993
Like, you wouldn't

21:24.366 --> 21:25.993
floor this...

21:26.077 --> 21:28.454
You got to floor a rocket

21:26.077 --> 21:28.454
or fucking people get hurt.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.415
(Sigh) Okay, boys,

21:28.537 --> 21:31.415
for fuck's sakes.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.751
All right, maybe I need

21:31.498 --> 21:33.751
to do more training

21:33.834 --> 21:36.087
before I'm an

21:33.834 --> 21:36.087
astronaut, okay?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.047
Fucking thanks for

21:36.170 --> 21:38.047
pointing it out!

21:38.131 --> 21:40.258
(Whimpering)

21:38.131 --> 21:40.258
That's all right, man.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.258
You did good.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.218
You were going

21:40.340 --> 21:42.218
pretty fast.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.428
I don't think you

21:42.301 --> 21:44.428
could be really an

21:42.301 --> 21:44.428
astronaut anyways.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.139
He said you couldn't

21:44.511 --> 21:46.139
be... you know, you're

21:44.511 --> 21:46.139
pretty much blind,

21:46.222 --> 21:48.390
and you're

21:46.222 --> 21:48.390
a pussy and...

21:48.474 --> 21:50.184
Ricky, come on.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.184
Fuck's sakes.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.685
You're a fucking

21:50.268 --> 21:51.685
good musician, man,

21:51.769 --> 21:53.187
and a good

21:51.769 --> 21:53.187
singer, okay?

21:53.271 --> 21:55.481
That's one thing

21:53.271 --> 21:55.481
you can do that's

21:53.271 --> 21:55.481
really good.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.151
That's right. Why do you want

21:55.564 --> 21:58.151
to go to space? Space is

21:55.564 --> 21:58.151
kinda fucking dumb anyway.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.278
Just stay on planet

21:58.234 --> 22:00.278
Earth and be a...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.155
Well, I'm still

22:00.360 --> 22:02.155
going to train to

22:00.360 --> 22:02.155
be an astronaut,

22:02.238 --> 22:05.574
but maybe I should

22:02.238 --> 22:05.574
focus more on

22:02.238 --> 22:05.574
my music career.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.993
Ricky:

22:05.658 --> 22:06.993
Fuck yeah.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.327
For the time being,

22:08.410 --> 22:09.829
until I can get

22:08.410 --> 22:09.829
better training and...

22:09.912 --> 22:11.998
That's right.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.998
build myself

22:09.912 --> 22:11.998
a centrifuge

22:12.081 --> 22:15.584
and get some high speed

22:12.081 --> 22:15.584
things... worked out.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.879
So what the fuck's

22:15.668 --> 22:18.879
the plan here, boys?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.879
Are we heading home?

22:18.963 --> 22:22.091
We've got no money left so...

22:18.963 --> 22:22.091
I don't know, maybe we should

22:18.963 --> 22:22.091
get back on track

22:22.175 --> 22:23.801
with the Swearnet thing,

22:22.175 --> 22:23.801
go to Charlotte,

22:23.884 --> 22:25.469
try to win some

22:23.884 --> 22:25.469
money back from that.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.097
Okay.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.097
Get drunk.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.097
Let's do it.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.598
Let's do that.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.598
I love you guys.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.017
I love you,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.017
too, man.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.268
Don't fucking call me

22:31.100 --> 22:32.268
blind though, Ricky,

22:32.350 --> 22:33.727
or I'll fucking

22:32.350 --> 22:33.727
sucker you!

22:33.811 --> 22:36.063
I didn't say that.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.063
Julian:

22:33.811 --> 22:36.063
All right.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.899
That was awesome.
