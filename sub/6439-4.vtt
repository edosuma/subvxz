WEBVTT

00:22.564 --> 00:24.649
- Up on your end.
- Back this way.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.943
Keep in line.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.696
Mommy, help me!

00:31.448 --> 00:34.033
Can't catch me.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.203
This way.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.021
Net and trident?

01:04.188 --> 01:07.066
The man appears more common
fisherman than gladiator.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.778
The style is called retiarius,
carried from the outer regions.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.197
They should carry it back.
I favor the murmillo.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.246
The crowd is of the opposite opinion.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.089
Aah!

01:35.012 --> 01:39.348
Soon there will be a retiarius
in the sands in every game.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.894
And the Ludus absent them
tragically lacking.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.479
Very well.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.732
Yet place net and trident in the hands
of one of our lesser men.

01:54.865 --> 01:55.865
Oh!

02:16.720 --> 02:18.679
Did I not tell you?
Listen to them.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.223
A spectacle to be sure.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.810
All the more thrilling if viewed
from the pulvinus.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.396
- Invitation was extended.
- And refused?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.440
The pulvinus is too far removed.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.859
I would witness the games here
among the people

02:32.027 --> 02:34.946
with son beside me.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.542
Your hour is upon you.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.174
A fine blade.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.594
To be wielded with deadly purpose.

02:58.762 --> 03:02.056
Reform my words in manner
Dagan understands.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.518
You bear the mark
of the brotherhood.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.189
An honor you have not earned.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.651
Your true test awaits you.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.529
Live and count yourself
among us.

03:17.698 --> 03:22.076
Die and prove yourselves
as unworthy as I suspect.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.879
Dagan says he will honor the House
of Batiatus with gifts of blood.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.299
As will the mighty Ashur.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.968
Then do not die too quickly.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.195
Go on, Ashur!

04:08.957 --> 04:10.791
Come on. Yes!

04:20.510 --> 04:22.011
Yes!

04:37.235 --> 04:39.278
Come on!

04:39.446 --> 04:42.073
No!

04:45.202 --> 04:46.869
Fucking yes!

04:49.373 --> 04:51.958
Show them no mercy!

05:06.682 --> 05:08.599
Yes!

05:12.104 --> 05:14.522
Hasdrubal falls!

05:14.690 --> 05:18.859
As all men who face Ashur!

05:19.027 --> 05:21.779
The man assumes credit
owed his betters.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.198
He is but swollen by the moment.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.326
Perhaps he will turn
greater performance next time.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.705
You speak of what
may never pass.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.583
Now the lesser matches
have passed,

05:34.751 --> 05:37.253
let us see something of note.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.589
Vettius, make presentation.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.634
I give the good people
of Capua this day

05:43.802 --> 05:45.803
my latest acquisition,

05:45.971 --> 05:48.055
certain to inflame passion

05:48.223 --> 05:50.891
and ignite fear in all who oppose him.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.644
From the darkest lands
east of the Rhine,

05:53.812 --> 05:57.857
behold Caburus Murmillo.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.699
The crowd favors Vettius' offering.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.870
They greet Gannicus with louder voice,
yet he stands removed from the games.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.622
Enter Drappes Thraex.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.085
Crixus shows promise,
yet again the same fate.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.796
Our men see victory
only to be awarded exclusion.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.592
The fruits reaped when you offend a man
beyond our station.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.260
Begin.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.435
I but stood ground to protect
our house as any Lanista would.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.897
Yet ambition beyond the title
clouds your judgment.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.694
We must be humble
if I am to repair relations

06:43.862 --> 06:45.780
with Tullius and see all our
men returned to the sands.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.907
Quickly I pray if we are
to place our men

06:48.075 --> 06:49.617
in the opening games
of the new arena.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.265
Reaching for such heights is what
sent you tumbling from favor.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.290
Strike it from your thoughts.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.460
Place mind and effort towards
more reasonable pursuits.

07:00.462 --> 07:04.298
Caburus! Caburus!

07:04.466 --> 07:08.427
Perhaps the procuring of a man
as worthy as Caburus.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.767
Fleeting opportunity
to enjoy the old arena

07:14.935 --> 07:18.270
and yet we're swept aside,
absent even casual regard.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.314
I consider it a blessing

07:20.482 --> 07:22.942
to be so reprieved
from condemning presence.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.445
The manner Titus glares at us, it is
a shock we do not burst into flame.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.615
He is but an old man
set upon his ways.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.035
He is a gorgon with a cock
turning all around him to stone.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.123
Titus does not fare well
in the dust and the heat.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.168
His health will prompt return
to the coast of Sicilia very soon.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.339
Until such glorious event, I would fade
from beneath his oppressive roof.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.467
You would leave me?

07:50.137 --> 07:53.180
You are with husband.

07:53.348 --> 07:57.101
A man who would never see you
harmed by whim or circumstance.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.937
I stand alone,

08:00.105 --> 08:02.857
severed from such protection.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.277
A perilous condition
that must be attended.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.822
You are never alone
while I draw breath.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.993
Words of much comfort.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.997
Though a husband with heavy purse
would be more so.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.041
Then we must find one
suitable to cause.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.629
A possibility presents itself
in most pleasing form.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.923
You know the man?

08:28.091 --> 08:31.177
I've seen him about in Rome
absent encumbrance of a wife.

08:31.344 --> 08:35.306
Well, how fortunate that we should come
upon him at this time and place.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.519
In desperate times fortune must
give way to more assertive hands.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.692
Petronius.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.112
Would the gods have me so blessed?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.700
Gaia. We were introduced
at one of Varus's affairs.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.994
Oh yes.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.997
- Yes yes, of course. Apologies.
- None required.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.833
Seeing you so unexpected
has lifted questionable spirits.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.627
Oh.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.129
- Lucretia can attest...
- You're Lucretia?

09:07.297 --> 09:10.925
Wife to the Lanista Batiatus?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.260
I do call him husband, yes.

09:13.428 --> 09:17.139
I have heard
your house spoken of

09:17.307 --> 09:20.851
and the, um, pleasures
contained within.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.296
Barca has lost form
since Auctus fell.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.215
His cock will find
another hole to fuck.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.554
Ah, we return anointed
in the blood

09:57.722 --> 09:59.390
of our enemies.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.642
Hasdrubal and Kleitos
met their end.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.312
The first of many to fall
beneath our swords in the arena.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.150
See yourselves to the baths.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.074
Gannicus. Pair with Rhaskos.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.784
To what end?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.620
If I am not to fight in the arena
I'll remain here in the shade.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.623
Doctore.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.377
Send the man up.
I would have words.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.839
Magnetius.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.550
One of the finest champions
this house has ever forged.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.347
He stood a titan.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.641
As all my champions.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.352
The culmination
of years of training,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.022
dedication, sacrifice.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.029
You would hold
yourself their equal?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.406
In the arena
I am every man's equal.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.867
Hmm.

11:00.035 --> 11:03.495
The champion is more than
his victories upon the sands.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.083
He is the sum of his actions.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.170
Every decision, no matter how small,
speaks to the man

11:11.338 --> 11:13.088
in the balance of his heart.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.632
In his breast beats the heart of a lion.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.889
And what does it beat for?

11:22.057 --> 11:25.100
The House of Batiatus.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.066
Return him to the Ludus.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.531
See? The man fights for the honor
of this house

11:39.699 --> 11:41.219
as all your champions
have in the past.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.204
Gannicus speaks but words
he knows I seek to hear.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.665
He is no champion of my house.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.799
I stand before Petronius
with obvious charms

11:56.966 --> 12:00.094
and all he can do is prattle
about the House of Batiatus.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.722
I fear I've lost delicate touch.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.934
Your touch is many things,
delicate not among them.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.144
You're of a mood.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.773
If word of what we have offered
has spread to Petronius,

12:12.941 --> 12:14.942
how long before it lights
on Titus' ear?

12:15.110 --> 12:17.027
Perhaps it should.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.862
The shock would no doubt
end the old goat.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.949
You jest while all around us
threatens to fucking crumble.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.952
The only threat is of you and Quintus
becoming favored among the elite.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.746
As a whore is favored
by the man atop her.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.125
It is not as if all of Rome knows.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.920
Only the most privileged tongues

12:35.088 --> 12:37.714
whisper of the delights
offered within these walls.

12:37.882 --> 12:42.010
Delights Petronius and his friends
long to witness for themselves.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.639
To even consider it
is beyond reason.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.766
If Titus were to...

12:47.934 --> 12:50.102
What joys does my father
prevent now?

12:51.521 --> 12:54.231
None of note.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.862
We came across Petronius
in the market.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.780
You are familiar with the name?

13:01.948 --> 13:05.284
As any man with their mind towards
business and the procuring of it.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.932
He is familiar with yours as well
and spoke with great interest

13:08.037 --> 13:10.539
of sampling of your more
exotic offerings

13:10.707 --> 13:13.500
with acquaintances
of equal position.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.003
And how did good Petronius
come to hear of such things?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.213
Varus and Cossutius.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.507
Their tongues are looser
than their cocks.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.801
Petronius departs for Rome
the day after next.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.597
Decision must be given quick birth
or see opportunity aborted.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.767
With the support of Petronius
we may yet find position

13:30.935 --> 13:32.519
in the opening games
of the new arena.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.354
- Quintus, your father...
- Make the arrangements.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.981
I'll attend to my father.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.378
Melitta. A word.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.922
I have none to give.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.633
It is a matter of some importance.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.010
A moment.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.186
You avoid my gaze.

14:14.354 --> 14:18.732
As you should mine
lest suspicions be aroused.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.984
Should they not also be aroused

14:21.152 --> 14:24.238
if two friends are no longer
seen to speak?

14:24.405 --> 14:26.865
What happened between us...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.784
Was not of our choosing.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.579
We must turn it from thought
and never give it voice.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.500
My tongue, it bends
to such warning.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.711
Yet the thought of you,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.964
it proves troublesome.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.050
The memory will fade with time,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.469
as do all things born
of misfortune.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.851
We were as brothers once
but no more.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.982
The men no longer accept me
as a gladiator

15:00.149 --> 15:02.901
and do not yet give respect
as doctore.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.822
Even Gannicus refuses
to heed my instruction.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.536
Gannicus heeds nothing
but his own desires

15:12.704 --> 15:14.913
beyond all reason.

15:15.081 --> 15:19.835
You must teach him that you alone
are in command.

15:20.003 --> 15:24.089
And by firm hand erase all doubts.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.511
Show them all the man
that I've given my heart to.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.845
Gnaeus.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.431
Your mastery of the sword
falls to question.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.184
The net and trident
are your weapons now.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.853
A fucking net, Oenomaus?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.911
You will do as commanded
absent complaint

16:36.079 --> 16:38.664
or see flesh stripped from bone.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.626
Yes, Doctore.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.674
Return to training.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.929
You speak as Jupiter hurling bolts
from the heavens.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.808
Raised there by words
and touch of loving wife.

16:59.018 --> 17:03.689
Now pair with Barca
and remain far from the shade.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.825
Barca.
Bring fucking spear to purpose.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.369
Again.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.794
Your man shows fire today.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.963
Ignited by your words I'm sure.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.801
- Honeyed wine, quickly.
- I'm fine.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.637
Sound and pallor
threaten disagreement.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.765
You are too long
from the salt air of the coast.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.934
And shall remain
from Sicilia longer still.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.187
- Do not waste breath on the matter.
- I would not see you so far removed.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.982
But a day or more
by the waters of Neapolis?

17:47.150 --> 17:48.859
- Oh.
- Yes, to revive color.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.947
My concern lies only
with this Ludus

17:54.115 --> 17:56.074
and seeing it to former glories.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.452
Well, then let our journey
serve dual cause.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.079
We can review the latest
shipment of slaves

18:01.247 --> 18:04.374
with mind towards procuring
a champion favored by us both.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.418
Someone to rival
Vettius' new man.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.506
Drink.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.058
You conspire against an old man.

18:24.145 --> 18:27.355
To your advantage.
Make preparation.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.983
We leave for Neapolis.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.070
See to my father.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.825
He is attended to as promised.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.703
Have Gaia send word to Petronius.
You entertain tonight.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.080
If he and his circle overreach?

18:44.248 --> 18:47.709
The appetites of men are not easily
set aside by the words of a woman.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.586
We'll send message to Solonius.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.074
He can stand in my place,
speak for the house if so needed.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.133
- Quintus.
- The risk outweighs concern.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.594
See to Petronius and his guests.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.348
And with their satisfaction our position
in the opening games is secured.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.071
Snare any fish today
in your little net?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.451
Reward for victory in the arena.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.704
Continue and see more weigh palm.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.336
Dagan questions receiving
the greater sum.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.880
We stood equally upon the sands.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.758
Tell him he receives twice the coin

19:36.926 --> 19:38.385
because you are half the man.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.057
I am a gladiator as he is.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.477
If we did not need you to exchange
our words for his,

19:47.645 --> 19:51.356
you would never have been given
chance to take up sword.

20:10.585 --> 20:13.712
Bread for your pets.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.974
Doiros was the brother
I held closest to me.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.894
He was a fierce warrior,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.271
as was my father
and all before us.

20:31.439 --> 20:35.692
I would sit at their feet and listen
to their many stories of battle,

20:35.860 --> 20:38.194
longing for the day
when I could pick up arms

20:38.362 --> 20:40.113
and stand beside them in glory.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.366
My father, my brothers,

20:43.534 --> 20:47.704
Doiros... I watched as they all fell
beneath the spears of the Arverni.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.459
My hand yet too small
to pick up sword,

20:52.627 --> 20:56.755
I was forced to serve,
to bow and scrape.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.215
First of all to the shits
who took my family

20:59.383 --> 21:02.260
and then to the Romans
they sold me to.

21:02.428 --> 21:07.057
Not a day passes where I do not dream
of honoring the dead,

21:07.224 --> 21:10.060
of proving myself worthy to them

21:10.227 --> 21:12.771
in blood and victory.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.399
Auctus is the first life
I've ever taken in battle.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.029
He will not be forgotten.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.951
They were Auctus' pets.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.164
I never favored them.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.755
Now they are all that's left.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.940
Line 'em up.
Make 'em stand up straight.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.402
What of this one?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.947
See how his form is carved with each
muscle building on to the next?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.658
A worthy addition to any Ludus.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.369
A fine offering, is he not?

22:09.537 --> 22:11.121
I would not waste coin.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.290
The man favors his left
revealing injury to the leg.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.544
Unsuitable for men of discerning eye.

22:17.712 --> 22:21.339
Let us turn to something
of rarer quality.

22:21.507 --> 22:25.343
I have a Thracian of the Maedi tribe,

22:25.511 --> 22:27.387
the likes of which you have...

22:27.555 --> 22:30.682
Thracians are too difficult to control
and aggravate the Gauls beyond reason.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.059
My son speaks truth.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.688
You offer us piss
and claim it wine.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.024
You'll find none better in Neapolis.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.943
I would hope your city's drink
holds higher standard.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.362
Come, let us seek libation

22:44.530 --> 22:46.698
to wash the taste of shit
from mouth.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.546
- Diona.
- It does not hurt.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.925
Wait. We haven't spoken
or laughed as we usually do.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.927
I have no time for childish things.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.182
Domina wishes me bathed
for tonight.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.104
Take this to Oenomaus. These men
are to be brought to the villa

23:18.272 --> 23:20.774
- properly oiled and scented.
- Yes, Domina.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.611
There is much I will need
attended to tonight.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.988
I would have you by my side,

23:27.156 --> 23:29.824
not be dislodged by any request.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.743
Gratitude.

23:31.911 --> 23:36.414
There is one thing
that I would ask you in return.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.336
It is well known that your husband's
allegiance lies with Titus.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.964
Sway him to keep what we do here
confined to shadow,

23:45.132 --> 23:48.051
or I fear that other secrets

23:48.219 --> 23:49.803
will find their way into the light.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.015
Am I understood?

23:54.183 --> 23:56.309
Yes, Domina.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.228
See it done.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.158
Venus blushes in her garden,

24:12.326 --> 24:14.577
shamed by such beauty.

24:14.745 --> 24:18.665
Would that she stood in my place
and I among the roots and leaves.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.294
These hands were not meant
for common earth.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.506
They have held me close
as dearest friend,

24:26.674 --> 24:28.466
as sister.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.303
Tonight mine shall return favor

24:32.471 --> 24:36.349
and aid yours in seizing position
so richly deserved.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.061
Oh.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.530
Solonius arrives.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.491
Let us greet him

24:53.659 --> 24:57.036
and forge memory of a night
not soon forgotten.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.439
The man is no Gannicus,

25:24.607 --> 25:27.483
yet he surpasses in enthusiasm.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.944
They are well received.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.530
As are all things born of base desire.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.534
Apologies.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.953
We ask too much of you in this.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.831
But your presence is of great comfort.

25:41.999 --> 25:45.543
Situation forces us all to actions
otherwise never considered.

25:45.711 --> 25:49.964
Blame lies in the Fates
absolving weighted heart.

26:01.852 --> 26:04.604
See this to the pantry

26:04.772 --> 26:08.483
and remain there until I call upon you
after all have left.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.825
We dishonor this house.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.328
We but do as commanded.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.413
Cause does not alter result.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.626
No, yet me must move beyond it
or be driven to madness.

26:32.549 --> 26:37.345
The man fucks as a
bull horns to purpose.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.603
Gratitude for gracing
the House of Batiatus

26:45.771 --> 26:49.232
with esteemed presence,
one which my husband

26:49.400 --> 26:52.235
regrets he cannot share
due to pressing business.

26:52.403 --> 26:55.905
Oh, I had not noticed his absence.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.324
What you have seen
is but a taste of the pleasures

26:58.492 --> 27:00.285
afforded you beneath humble roof.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.289
Our gladiators, our slaves,

27:04.456 --> 27:08.376
everything within these walls I place
at the whims of your desire.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.380
For a single night
you are the masters of this house.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.507
An enticing offer.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.429
One I would see to full advantage.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.850
Tullius.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.696
I have never cared for surprises.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.533
And you have provided many
in your day.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.328
Your disappointment
has often been given a voice.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.330
A loud and clear one.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.708
Disappointment can only exist
upon expectation.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.793
You proved from tender age

27:50.961 --> 27:54.005
that you would listen to no one's
counsel save your own.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.676
When did I ever turn from iron advice?

27:58.844 --> 28:02.013
A desire to gain military experience
raised your objection,

28:02.181 --> 28:03.765
I turned from it.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.932
You commanded that I run
the Ludus in your absence,

28:05.934 --> 28:09.020
I obeyed abandoning my own desires
long since forgotten.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.439
When has son
even denied the father?

28:12.608 --> 28:14.692
When he married a woman beneath him.

28:18.614 --> 28:22.283
You were wrong about her
as you have been of many things.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.748
An old man's mistakes
swell in the breast

28:28.916 --> 28:31.876
as remaining days shrink.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.253
You will outlive us all.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.464
You're too stubborn to die.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.633
Do you think me a fool, Quintus?

28:40.302 --> 28:43.054
There are many words I would use
towards your description,

28:43.222 --> 28:45.390
fool lives not amongst them.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.974
No it's not.

28:47.142 --> 28:50.228
You knew those slaves were shit
before we ever set foot to path.

28:50.396 --> 28:54.899
Purchase of men was not the reason
you parted me from the Ludus, was it?

28:59.363 --> 29:02.990
You wish to find common ground

29:03.158 --> 29:07.245
far from the site
of former disagreements.

29:09.748 --> 29:14.502
My deception meant only to strengthen
the bond between father and son.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.342
This surprise is one most welcome.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.887
And long overdue.

29:25.055 --> 29:28.015
Yet we did not need to travel
so far from comfort.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.602
I would return home and continue
in warmer surroundings.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.105
- What, now?
- Yes.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.023
Should we not wait
until the break of day?

29:36.191 --> 29:39.402
A few hours upon the road
and our own beds to fall to.

29:39.570 --> 29:43.322
Come. Let us put this wretched city
behind us

29:43.490 --> 29:45.867
and embrace closer future.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.757
How does that man find himself here?

30:01.925 --> 30:05.178
Petronius or perhaps loose tongue
of his confederates.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.096
His presence changes nothing.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.806
It upends the fucking earth.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.059
I will break words and gauge intent.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.898
To stand with a smile
in our fucking house

30:17.065 --> 30:18.983
after the injury
put to my husband...

30:19.151 --> 30:23.279
Force him from thought or see effort
and risk fall short of reward.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.783
Petronius and his guests
stand erect with expectation.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.870
Let us see them to climax.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.955
Bring them in.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.469
Good Tullius, seeing you here
comes as surprise.

30:46.637 --> 30:49.388
Surely not to you.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.851
I warned you of
Batiatus' maneuverings

30:54.019 --> 30:57.480
not as invitation, but in hopes you
would prevent such foolishness

30:57.648 --> 31:01.108
and the retribution to valued friend
that it would bring.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.612
You warned me to grow favor.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.574
Continue speaking
and see it wither.

31:18.043 --> 31:21.212
You have shared drink, food,

31:21.380 --> 31:25.174
distractions of the eye and ear.

31:25.342 --> 31:28.678
Yet these are common things
enjoyed by men

31:28.845 --> 31:31.931
bound by accusing morality
of their deeds.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.810
I would see you freed
from such human constraints.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.356
Touch these to flesh.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.984
Sever all ties from the mortal world

31:43.151 --> 31:47.446
and rise as gods
in the House of Batiatus.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.120
Oh, Jupiter.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.123
Never in our dealings, Tullius,

31:57.291 --> 31:59.917
have I been so elevated.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.920
This house truly is a marvel.

32:04.089 --> 32:07.925
If I am to assume the mantle of a god,
I would first prove myself

32:08.093 --> 32:09.927
against one.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.179
You would challenge Gannicus?

32:12.347 --> 32:13.931
A harmless exhibition

32:14.099 --> 32:17.435
to measure humble skill
against vaunted prowess.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.313
I would poison my desires
to witness such a thing.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.941
Gather the practice swords.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.401
Wood?

32:25.569 --> 32:29.989
But the clash of steel rings through
the halls of Olympus, does it not?

32:31.533 --> 32:33.326
Give them your swords.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.828
Let us clear space and have contest.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.421
See grin removed.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.507
You are to indulge him,
allow a show of blood.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.594
But level no insult
nor injury in return.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.513
Such action would bear
unfortunate consequence.

32:54.681 --> 32:58.309
- I am to lose?
- And win your life.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.394
Come.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.022
Let us see if I recall what I learned

33:03.190 --> 33:06.734
years ago in service to the Republic.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.778
It begins to return to me.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.668
I stand unscathed.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.420
Perhaps you are not
the champion I believed.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.464
This goes too far.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.460
Tullius!

34:47.627 --> 34:50.838
The man gives the missio.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.759
The match is yours.

34:59.097 --> 35:03.893
God of the arena
saved by a woman.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.480
See him to the medicus.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.191
An excellent diversion.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.528
Gratitude for allowing it.

35:14.696 --> 35:19.033
Ah, I have delayed
proceedings past reason.

35:19.201 --> 35:23.120
Come, let us explore
what other pleasures

35:23.288 --> 35:26.540
may be mined
from the House of Batiatus.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.423
That fucking animal,

35:34.591 --> 35:36.675
to turn simple exhibition
to blood.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.803
I could have ended
the man in half a breath.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.555
Yet you allowed him
to nearly kill you.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.892
I was ordered not to raise hand.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.686
Other commands
have been more pleasurable.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.523
Are you never serious?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.446
On occasion.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.868
I should return to the villa.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.578
You should.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.874
Why are you doing this?

36:09.042 --> 36:10.960
Because to not would be a lie

36:11.127 --> 36:13.128
much deeper than the one
we tell Oenomaus.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.923
I did not want this.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.218
I love that man like a brother.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.096
Yet what I feel for you...

36:24.474 --> 36:27.685
Tell me it does not stir
in your breast as well.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.353
What I feel means nothing.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.355
It holds the world.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.733
What would you do if you were my husband
and you learned of such a thing?

36:34.901 --> 36:36.694
I would kill us both.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.623
You are an imposing brute.

37:30.790 --> 37:34.376
Tell me, giant,
where do your tastes lie?

37:34.544 --> 37:37.087
Toward cock or cunt?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.257
Uh, apologies.
He does not grasp your language.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.760
Are you able to form words
so that he may?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.849
I serve but to do so.

37:49.017 --> 37:53.187
I do not care
for struggle nor complaint.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.481
Will you submit to all I ask for?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.826
- He's agreeable.
- Come then.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.745
I'll have your ass quickly.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.296
He tells me he hopes you're not
of a gentle nature.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.299
A brute such as this
craves rough hands

38:22.467 --> 38:24.510
and cock their equal.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.429
Then he shall be well satisfied.
Come.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.400
How does he fare?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.151
Painfully, yet he lives.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.987
It should not have happened.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.030
To be said
of many things this night.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.957
He does not drink,
he does not fuck.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.127
- Why does he remain?
- The man is a mystery.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.256
One I would have forever solved.
You could gauge nothing of his intent?

39:02.424 --> 39:04.675
He fears your husband
attempts maneuver.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.970
I believe his presence is meant
only to rattle nerves.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.768
Tullius will give voice of this
until the din reaches Titus's ears.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.896
Then we must keep
his tongue occupied.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.524
You believe your charms
will sway him?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.609
You know nothing of women, Solonius.

39:22.777 --> 39:26.030
And even less of their charms.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.783
Oh, I would not ask you to do this.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.619
- That is why I offer.
- The only reason?

39:32.787 --> 39:35.372
The man proves troublesome thorn.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.624
Who better to remove it
than trusted friend?

39:37.792 --> 39:38.959
Gaia...

39:39.127 --> 39:41.503
Keep thoughts
towards elevating this house.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.589
I will see to Tullius.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.717
And in the act secure
elevation of my own

39:46.885 --> 39:49.219
to the benefit of all.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.562
The woman thinks highly of herself.

39:58.730 --> 40:02.316
An estimation deeply shared.

40:02.484 --> 40:05.736
You've become a difficult man
to gain private audience with.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.114
It was not always so.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.868
Much has changed
since our youth.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.706
Not everything, I hope.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.753
I remember a time when it was you

40:22.921 --> 40:25.422
who was impossible to trap alone.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.426
Every man in Capua was at your feet.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.848
Now I would have but one

40:35.016 --> 40:37.434
standing beside me.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.447
I was saddened to hear
of your husband's passing.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.991
Were you?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.664
Only with thoughts toward you

40:58.832 --> 41:02.000
once again
with no family to speak of.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.504
No one to care for you.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.135
It is a difficult thing

41:11.302 --> 41:14.138
to find a man of my standing.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.561
I always favored this color.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.773
I know.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.278
The gods smile upon me

41:29.445 --> 41:32.406
having had word
of this night reach my ears.

41:32.574 --> 41:34.158
The fortune is mine.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.494
Yet I would have word of it
travel no further.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.043
You petition this for yourself?

41:48.047 --> 41:51.466
Or for the House of Batiatus?

41:53.678 --> 41:56.263
Lucretia is as a sister to me.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.849
Mmm.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.269
I would not see her injured
by wagging tongue.

42:03.730 --> 42:06.690
You ask much.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.775
I offer more.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.375
I swear never to speak of what
has happened this night...

42:26.753 --> 42:29.755
if you would deliver
a message to your friend...

42:31.216 --> 42:33.008
and her husband.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.552
One they would take to heart...

42:37.972 --> 42:39.348
coming from you.

43:01.079 --> 43:04.081
Words have not inflated beyond truth.

43:04.249 --> 43:08.961
The offerings of the House of Batiatus
are truly to be admired.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.339
Well, even more so upon the sands.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.217
Imagine the excitement
our wares would cause

43:15.385 --> 43:18.178
if included in the opening celebration
of the new arena.

43:18.346 --> 43:21.181
Capua would be blessed
by such appearance.

43:21.349 --> 43:24.017
I'll send word to your husband
to discuss the matter.

43:29.941 --> 43:33.068
Oh, I thought this night
would never end.

43:33.236 --> 43:37.114
It concludes with this house
soaring to the heavens upon your wings.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.700
A feat aided by your presence.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.244
The evening would have gone
as well had I never known.

43:42.412 --> 43:43.620
Perhaps more so.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.999
The hour is late.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.085
Take to your bed
and carry with you my gratitude.

43:50.253 --> 43:53.588
I would linger until all guests
have departed.

43:53.756 --> 43:57.634
Well, Gaia is a woman
of great appetite.

43:57.802 --> 44:01.179
Dawn will threaten
before she has had her fill.

44:02.932 --> 44:04.641
- Lucretia.
- Hmm?

44:04.809 --> 44:08.687
This house is pale shadow
absent your light.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.749
See everything restored
to proper place.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.918
- Nothing must be suspected.
- Yes, Domina.

44:33.546 --> 44:36.298
I know you feel it's betrayal.

44:36.466 --> 44:40.302
But there are times
when truth is more hurtful.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.304
Titus must never know.

44:42.472 --> 44:43.930
Domina.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.356
Apollo.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.691
God of the sun.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.195
And truth.

45:01.824 --> 45:05.660
Something often obscured
by the masks we wear.

45:07.914 --> 45:10.332
Your guests have abandoned you.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.293
I thought the toad Solonius
would at least remain.

45:13.461 --> 45:16.546
The hour is late.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.007
He believed you occupied
for the night.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.551
They say Apollo brings warmth
and prosperity

45:21.719 --> 45:23.178
to those who would pray to him.

45:23.346 --> 45:27.307
Those who understand their place
on their knees.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.060
Tullius...

45:30.228 --> 45:32.270
You know, I often dreamt
of Gaia's touch

45:32.438 --> 45:34.731
when I was a younger man.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.234
The taste of her lips.

45:37.402 --> 45:40.862
Now they form words in my ear
asking favor for this house

45:41.030 --> 45:43.323
placing me in difficult position.

45:43.491 --> 45:47.160
Gaia's affections for this house
are genuine.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.621
As are her feelings for you.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.957
Returned in kind.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.961
She holds my reply.

45:56.129 --> 45:59.089
Go to her and see it delivered.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.691
Gaia?

46:18.693 --> 46:20.193
Gaia.

46:43.593 --> 46:46.094
Have you lost mind?

46:46.262 --> 46:48.680
Again attempting to maneuver
around Tullius.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.183
I only sought
to elevate our position.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.852
By plunging the good name
of this house into muck and shit?

46:54.020 --> 46:55.812
What would you have me do?

46:55.980 --> 46:58.315
Bow and scrape
to the fucking lunatic?

46:58.483 --> 47:00.317
He is above our station!

47:00.485 --> 47:02.360
I gave warning
not to provoke the man.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.779
You ignore it
and here are the results...

47:04.947 --> 47:07.908
a Roman citizen
dead in my house.

47:08.075 --> 47:11.036
By the hands of the very man
you defend.

47:11.204 --> 47:13.622
You helped set this in motion

47:13.789 --> 47:16.500
and now claim innocence
in the outcome?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.128
I claim vengeance.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.964
His life for hers.

47:23.132 --> 47:26.927
Blood and brains
on the fucking floor.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.262
- Reward well deserved.
- No.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.932
There will be no retribution.

47:32.099 --> 47:35.769
- I will see him dead.
- You will do as fucking commanded.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.525
And what of Gaia?

47:46.781 --> 47:48.949
She partook of too much wine...

47:49.992 --> 47:52.494
as she was often known to do.

47:52.662 --> 47:55.205
In the night she lost footing

47:55.373 --> 47:57.666
and fell to her death
at the bottom of the cliff.

47:59.794 --> 48:03.129
Do not look to him.
I am the dominus of this fucking house.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.799
See it done. Quintus.

48:21.691 --> 48:23.858
So this is why you spirited me
to Neapolis.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.069
Not to find common ground
but to bury your father.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.905
- That was not my intent.
- You knew nothing of this?

48:29.073 --> 48:31.408
It was all that woman's doing?
Huh?

48:31.576 --> 48:34.744
The two of you feed off each other,

48:34.912 --> 48:37.205
fattening yourselves with lies.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.708
Well, I would see the feast at an end.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.711
- What is your meaning?
- You know my fucking meaning.

48:42.878 --> 48:45.797
That ill-bred woman has brought
this family nothing but shame.

48:45.965 --> 48:49.134
- She is my wife!
- Because I foolishly allowed it.

48:50.553 --> 48:53.054
I wanted you to have
something of your own,

48:53.222 --> 48:56.141
something that held meaning to you
even if no one else saw it.

48:56.309 --> 48:58.602
Yet what has she given you?

48:58.769 --> 49:02.647
No dowry to speak of,
no name to elevate status,

49:02.815 --> 49:06.109
and no heir
to carry the name Batiatus.

49:10.406 --> 49:14.826
Every choice you make
shapes your fate, Quintus.

49:14.994 --> 49:17.495
I cannot change
missteps of the past,

49:17.663 --> 49:19.414
but I will see you
on proper path.

49:19.582 --> 49:22.042
And Lucretia
must be swept from it.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.752
You would dissolve my marriage?

49:23.919 --> 49:27.213
No, you will make that choice
for yourself

49:27.381 --> 49:29.591
or be gone from this
house with her.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.496
Wait!
