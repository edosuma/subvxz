My next guest is
the leader of a cause

00:54.911 --> 00:56.979
that I personally didn't
know existed.

00:57.047 --> 00:59.249
It's a fight
against masturbation.

00:59.317 --> 01:02.185
Ellen Favor is the president
and founder of CAM,

01:02.253 --> 01:04.554
or Christians
Against Masturbation.

01:04.622 --> 01:05.889
Ellen, welcome to the program.

01:05.956 --> 01:07.491
Thank you for having me.

01:07.558 --> 01:09.093
It's a pleasure to be here.

01:09.161 --> 01:11.662
Well, "pleasure," I believe
that is the issue here.

01:11.729 --> 01:13.430
Is that what
your group is against?

01:13.497 --> 01:15.031
Of course not.

01:15.099 --> 01:17.633
We believe God put us
on the earth to enjoy life

01:17.701 --> 01:19.668
and enjoy the world
he created for us.

01:19.736 --> 01:22.771
But why form a group against
something like this?

01:22.839 --> 01:24.840
Thank you for asking me that.

01:24.907 --> 01:26.442
I wouldn't be doing this

01:26.510 --> 01:28.044
if I didn't think
it was very important.

01:28.112 --> 01:29.512
But there are some people
who would say,

01:29.580 --> 01:31.448
come on,
it's just masturbation.

01:31.515 --> 01:33.883
I don't think of it
as just masturbation.

01:33.951 --> 01:36.886
Frankly, I think of it
as a tragedy.

01:36.954 --> 01:38.255
A tragedy?

01:38.322 --> 01:40.925
You mean like a tsunami
or Rwanda?

01:40.993 --> 01:42.660
Yes, I think it's that serious,

01:42.728 --> 01:45.430
because those events--
While certainly tragic--

01:45.498 --> 01:48.800
Affected only one region of
people in the world or another,

01:48.868 --> 01:52.937
while masturbation is a crime
against-- Against God

01:53.005 --> 01:55.639
and against the person
who does it to themselves.

01:55.707 --> 01:58.209
Young people all over the world

01:58.276 --> 02:00.310
are depriving themselves
of the greatest gift

02:00.378 --> 02:02.613
that the lord bestowed
upon them at their birth,

02:02.680 --> 02:06.483
their purity and grace
in his eyes.

02:06.551 --> 02:08.586
Well, that's--
That's very compelling.

02:08.653 --> 02:11.556
Let's bring in our next guest,
comedian Louis C.K.,

02:11.624 --> 02:14.726
who some might describe as an
aficionado of masturbation,

02:14.794 --> 02:17.798
a man who is well-known for
being a prolific masturbator,

02:17.865 --> 02:19.399
who even brags about it.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.035
Is that fair to say, Louie?

02:21.103 --> 02:22.303
Yeah, that's fair.

02:22.371 --> 02:24.205
In fact, you're the only
person we could find

02:24.273 --> 02:26.675
who would come here
to defend masturbation.

02:26.743 --> 02:28.144
Well, I like it.

02:28.211 --> 02:29.645
It's-- It's easy
and it's fun

02:29.713 --> 02:31.047
and nobody gets hurt.

02:31.115 --> 02:32.582
Well, isn't that the point
here, Ellen?

02:32.650 --> 02:35.352
With all due respect, why
do you care what a man does

02:35.420 --> 02:38.089
in the privacy of
his own house?

02:38.157 --> 02:39.958
God cares.

02:40.025 --> 02:43.829
The Bible teaches us that lust
in your heart is a sin

02:43.896 --> 02:46.498
when acted upon outside
the context of marriage.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.133
Well, I'm not married,

02:48.201 --> 02:50.736
so anything I do is
outside of that context.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.905
I'm not against having sex.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.208
I believe that the lord
put desire in your heart

02:55.276 --> 02:57.010
as a beacon for love.

02:57.078 --> 03:00.481
It's the way that we can find
someone and marry them

03:00.549 --> 03:03.484
and enjoy each other
under his loving gaze.

03:03.552 --> 03:04.985
Wait a minute,

03:05.053 --> 03:07.521
you mean that God watches
married people have sex.

03:07.589 --> 03:09.290
Well, God watches over
everything.

03:09.358 --> 03:11.292
So we're like porn for God?

03:11.359 --> 03:14.161
He watches us and then
he probably masturbates.

03:14.229 --> 03:15.863
Okay, that is way
out of line, Mr. C.K.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.097
This young lady--

03:17.165 --> 03:18.766
That's all right.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.434
I know you're a comedian,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.269
so this is probably
so funny to you.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.037
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

03:24.105 --> 03:26.306
That's what's so sad.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.642
That you don't know
the darkness that you live in.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.711
Uh, no, I know the darkness.

03:30.779 --> 03:33.214
You don't have to
live this way.

03:33.282 --> 03:36.884
There is a life of joy and
passion waiting for you,

03:36.952 --> 03:38.720
if you just stop
hurting yourself.

03:38.787 --> 03:40.989
How can you tell people
not to masturbate?

03:41.057 --> 03:42.557
I mean, nobody can not do it.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.593
Since there's been people,

03:44.661 --> 03:47.096
all of them--
Every single person, ever--

03:47.164 --> 03:48.597
Has masturbated.

03:48.665 --> 03:52.134
Napoleon masturbated,
Gandhi, Joan Jett,

03:52.202 --> 03:54.170
Shakespeare.

03:54.238 --> 03:55.738
Shakespeare, definitely.

03:55.806 --> 03:57.674
It's like telling people
not to breathe.

03:57.742 --> 04:00.143
It's really--
It's not fair.

04:00.211 --> 04:03.381
I pity you,
that you think that,

04:03.449 --> 04:05.316
that you can't not do it.

04:05.384 --> 04:06.985
Have you ever tried?

04:07.052 --> 04:08.720
Tried not to masturbate?

04:08.788 --> 04:10.121
Yes.

04:10.189 --> 04:12.123
Well, sometimes I won't
do it for, like, a week

04:12.191 --> 04:13.425
but that's just so that
when I do it again,

04:13.492 --> 04:14.993
it'll be way better.

04:15.061 --> 04:17.028
But what if you really stopped?

04:17.063 --> 04:19.063
What if you saved that
urge inside of you

04:19.431 --> 04:22.100
and thought of it
as something sacred?

04:22.168 --> 04:24.269
Until you meet the right
person and you love them

04:24.336 --> 04:26.103
and then you
get married to them,

04:26.171 --> 04:28.206
and then you can give that
to them

04:28.273 --> 04:31.575
as a gift that you've
cherished and you saved.

04:31.643 --> 04:33.010
That's beautiful.

04:33.077 --> 04:34.211
Have you ever been married?

04:34.278 --> 04:35.579
No.

04:35.646 --> 04:37.013
I was married for nine years,

04:37.081 --> 04:38.881
and believe me,
God was not smiling.

04:38.949 --> 04:40.850
And now you're alone.

04:40.917 --> 04:43.485
And you masturbate
and you're alone.

04:43.553 --> 04:46.788
You asked me, Louie,
"Have you ever been married ?"

04:46.856 --> 04:50.191
Now I ask you, have you
ever been happy?

04:50.259 --> 04:51.893
Are you happy now?

05:10.648 --> 05:12.816
So Ellen, how does your
group get the word out?

05:12.883 --> 05:14.217
Are there rallies?

05:14.285 --> 05:15.952
Where is the picket line
for this?

05:16.020 --> 05:17.187
Oh, no.

05:17.255 --> 05:19.222
We have meetings,
it's like a town hall.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.024
We bring people to gather

05:21.092 --> 05:23.360
and inspire them to
walk a path of purity.

05:23.427 --> 05:25.462
You're welcome to come.

05:25.529 --> 05:27.130
I'd be happy if you did.

05:27.197 --> 05:28.498
It sounds like
a lot of bullshit.

05:28.565 --> 05:29.833
Okay, we're ready to
wrap it up here.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.934
You know what really
pisses me off

05:31.002 --> 05:32.402
about people like you?

05:32.470 --> 05:33.604
You think you can
tell other people

05:33.671 --> 05:35.272
like you've got the keys
to how to be happy.

05:35.340 --> 05:37.741
You know,
you don't know me, okay?

05:37.809 --> 05:39.443
And you don't know God.

05:39.511 --> 05:41.211
God probably hates
people like you

05:41.279 --> 05:43.147
that try to tell
other people what to do.

05:43.214 --> 05:44.648
Wow.

05:44.715 --> 05:46.316
Masturbating's really
important to you.

05:46.384 --> 05:47.551
Yeah, it is.

05:47.619 --> 05:49.353
It keeps me sane.

05:49.421 --> 05:51.389
I'm a good citizen,
I'm a good father,

05:51.456 --> 05:54.159
I recycle and I masturbate.

05:54.226 --> 05:55.493
And I'm proud of it.

05:55.561 --> 05:57.462
And God's happy.

05:57.530 --> 05:59.431
And later, I'm gonna masturbate

05:59.499 --> 06:00.932
and I'm gonna think about you

06:01.000 --> 06:02.634
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

06:02.702 --> 06:04.169
I hope you do think about me.
Uh-huh.

06:04.237 --> 06:05.637
I hope you think about
what I said,

06:05.705 --> 06:07.271
that's exactly what I want.
Yeah.

06:07.339 --> 06:09.240
Okay, well, that concludes
our show for today.

06:09.308 --> 06:12.043
Thank you both for coming
and thank you for joining us,

06:12.111 --> 06:13.812
and from our studio
to your home,

06:13.879 --> 06:15.379
we bid you a fond good night.

06:29.327 --> 06:31.362
Hey.
Hey.

06:31.430 --> 06:32.897
Listen, I'm sorry, I--

06:32.964 --> 06:34.531
I meant what I said in there.

06:34.599 --> 06:36.066
You should come to a meeting.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.035
You don't want me there.

06:38.103 --> 06:40.070
No, I really do.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.739
Come on.

06:41.806 --> 06:43.374
You can dismiss it or mock it.

06:43.442 --> 06:45.643
Just give it a try.

06:45.711 --> 06:47.078
Are you being serious?

06:47.146 --> 06:48.479
I'm serious.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.081
I wouldn't kid around
about your soul.

06:52.618 --> 06:55.120
You know,
it's really sad about men

06:55.188 --> 06:59.291
that we can't have a beautiful
thought about a woman

06:59.359 --> 07:02.761
that isn't followed by
a disgusting thought

07:02.829 --> 07:05.164
about that same woman.

07:05.231 --> 07:07.366
We're not capable of it.

07:07.434 --> 07:09.835
We can't do one
without the other.

07:09.903 --> 07:11.804
If you're a woman and
a guy's ever said

07:11.871 --> 07:13.973
anything romantic to you,

07:14.040 --> 07:16.842
he just left off
the second part

07:16.910 --> 07:20.746
that would have made you sick

07:20.814 --> 07:23.883
if you could have heard it.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.151
That's how our brains work.

07:26.219 --> 07:28.587
"She's an angel...

07:28.655 --> 07:30.857
and I want her to
drown in my cum."

07:33.460 --> 07:37.664
That's the closest we can get
to poetry in our hearts.

07:39.967 --> 07:42.302
We love you, we really do.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.404
We think you're angels,

07:44.471 --> 07:47.207
and we want you to
drown in our cum.

07:47.274 --> 07:50.910
We want to drench your angel
wings that carry you to heaven

07:50.978 --> 07:53.880
with our sticky, gooey,
disgusting jism.

07:53.948 --> 07:55.415
That's what we want!

07:55.483 --> 07:57.151
I'm sorr-- It's just
the way we are.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.741
Can you hold that?

08:24.346 --> 08:25.946
Thank you.

08:26.014 --> 08:27.448
It's no problem.

08:30.951 --> 08:32.752
Just had to stick my arm out.

10:03.573 --> 10:04.573
Hi.

10:06.876 --> 10:08.110
Hey.

10:08.178 --> 10:10.279
Um...

10:10.347 --> 10:12.448
Can you, like,
help me out with this?

10:15.652 --> 10:17.119
With that?

10:17.187 --> 10:19.222
Yeah, with this.

10:19.289 --> 10:22.859
What seems to be the problem?

10:22.927 --> 10:25.796
It's just that there's,
like, zero dicks in there.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.068
Zero dicks?

10:31.136 --> 10:32.337
Yeah.

10:32.404 --> 10:34.139
There are, like,
no dicks in there.

10:34.207 --> 10:35.607
Ugh, it's so annoying.

10:35.675 --> 10:37.009
Can you, like, help me out?

10:39.912 --> 10:42.781
Can you, just like, stick a
whole bag of dicks in there?

10:42.849 --> 10:44.650
A bag of dicks?

10:46.419 --> 10:48.988
Yeah, that would be so great.

10:49.056 --> 10:50.690
You have a bag of dicks
right there.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.264
Ugh.

10:57.332 --> 10:58.866
You want me to
put these in there?

10:58.933 --> 11:00.234
Um, yeah.

11:03.004 --> 11:04.672
Should I take each one out
and put it--

11:04.740 --> 11:06.975
Well, can you, just like,
shove the whole bag in there?

11:07.043 --> 11:08.710
Okay, I'll--

11:16.419 --> 11:19.154
Oh, my God...

11:19.221 --> 11:20.855
That's so much better.

11:23.425 --> 11:24.391
Keep going!

11:24.459 --> 11:26.126
I'm trying, I'm trying.

11:43.010 --> 11:46.178
You trying to put the whole
bag of dick in there?

11:46.246 --> 11:48.648
This is the way she likes it.

11:48.715 --> 11:50.783
There is no room.

11:50.851 --> 11:53.052
Hey, screw you.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.723
American women
are very complicated.

12:09.670 --> 12:12.906
Don't be ashamed
to live without shame.

12:12.974 --> 12:15.176
Just remember to keep
your body pure

12:15.244 --> 12:16.878
so that the Lord can enter it.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.290
So...
Hey.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.625
What'd you think?

12:31.693 --> 12:32.993
That was really something.

12:33.061 --> 12:34.394
I think it's great you came.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.862
I'm glad I came.

12:35.930 --> 12:37.397
So do you want to get a drink?

12:37.465 --> 12:38.565
Yeah, sure.

12:53.782 --> 12:55.717
Why are you so nervous?

12:55.785 --> 12:58.086
I don't know.

12:58.154 --> 13:00.923
I mean, this is weird.

13:00.991 --> 13:03.259
This is definitely weird.

13:03.326 --> 13:06.362
You're... a thing
and I'm, you know.

13:06.429 --> 13:08.464
There's things about me
that if you knew them,

13:08.532 --> 13:10.766
you would be very disgusted.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.968
I'm not disgusted with you.

13:13.036 --> 13:15.371
I'm concerned for you, maybe.

13:15.439 --> 13:17.740
But you're a good person.

13:17.807 --> 13:20.142
I can tell.

13:20.209 --> 13:22.444
I'd like to know you.

13:24.815 --> 13:26.048
Come on.

13:26.116 --> 13:27.483
A guy like you
has to know how to

13:27.551 --> 13:29.786
talk to a pretty girl,
doesn't he?

13:29.854 --> 13:32.055
Yeah, but not--

13:32.123 --> 13:34.324
You know, usually,
that's when I'm trying to--

13:36.827 --> 13:39.463
Yeah, so, you kind of
need that incentive

13:39.530 --> 13:41.631
to bring out the charm.

13:41.699 --> 13:45.702
Well, go ahead and pretend
you're trying to...

13:45.770 --> 13:47.271
have me.

13:47.338 --> 13:49.072
It'll be fun to watch.

13:54.679 --> 13:56.046
So are you--

13:56.114 --> 13:57.681
Are you seriously a virgin?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.883
Yes, Louie,
I am very seriously a virgin.

13:59.951 --> 14:01.952
It's very serious.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.688
Well, look, I know it sounds
dumb, but I think it's--

14:04.756 --> 14:06.389
I think it's kind of sad.

14:06.457 --> 14:08.058
Why?

14:08.126 --> 14:10.360
Well, losing your virginity
is supposed to be

14:10.428 --> 14:13.697
just a tragic,
stupid, silly moment

14:13.765 --> 14:15.932
and you only get it once.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.002
For you, it's gonna be
this big, grown-up thing.

14:19.070 --> 14:21.204
What was it like for you?

14:21.272 --> 14:23.005
For me?

14:23.073 --> 14:24.740
My first time with a girl?

14:24.807 --> 14:26.908
Yeah.

14:26.976 --> 14:30.845
Well, I was in high school
and it was my girlfriend.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.048
The first thing
that we did, she--

14:34.116 --> 14:35.449
She jerked me off.

14:35.517 --> 14:36.483
Sorry.

14:36.551 --> 14:38.351
Go ahead, I asked.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.420
Well, she--

14:40.488 --> 14:42.623
She's touching me, and nobody
had ever touched my penis

14:42.690 --> 14:44.491
so it was really a big deal,

14:44.559 --> 14:45.927
and she was being all
high school

14:45.994 --> 14:48.229
and tugging and just awkward

14:48.297 --> 14:52.400
and it was so intense
that when I--

14:52.468 --> 14:55.837
When I came,
it was with such force,

14:55.905 --> 15:00.175
that I-- I started farting.

15:00.243 --> 15:04.180
And I'm coming and farting
and she's laughing.

15:04.248 --> 15:07.718
That was the basis of
my whole life sexually,

15:07.786 --> 15:10.254
was just shame...

15:10.322 --> 15:13.591
and cum and farts.

15:13.659 --> 15:16.528
Yeah, I can see I missed
something there.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.201
Yeah.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.637
Well, do you want to
come up to my suite?

15:24.704 --> 15:28.874
I'm having fun, but I'm
kind of sick of being out.

15:28.941 --> 15:31.409
Yeah, suite?

15:31.477 --> 15:32.944
Sounds-- Sounds nice.

15:33.012 --> 15:34.912
They pay you well to be a
not-coming person, huh?

15:34.980 --> 15:36.247
You get suites?

15:36.314 --> 15:37.948
All right,
let's go to your suite.

15:50.695 --> 15:52.795
Just want to get ready for bed.

15:52.863 --> 15:54.197
Sure.

15:59.903 --> 16:02.505
So how did you get to
be a Christian?

16:02.573 --> 16:05.307
Oh, well, I was born one.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.810
I mean, we all are.

16:07.878 --> 16:10.546
What about Jews?

16:10.614 --> 16:14.550
Well, they're God's children
too and Christ loves them.

16:14.618 --> 16:17.187
I just think we should be
accepting and try to under--

16:17.255 --> 16:18.588
Uh, oh, oh--

16:20.591 --> 16:22.226
Sorry.

16:22.293 --> 16:23.527
Come on.

16:23.595 --> 16:25.162
You couldn't have thought
that one was gonna work.

16:25.230 --> 16:26.397
I know, I just--

16:26.465 --> 16:28.099
I know, you wanted it,
so you went to take it.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.568
That's how you are.

16:29.635 --> 16:31.703
Well, how do you not?

16:31.771 --> 16:33.105
I mean, my odds
were pretty low here,

16:33.173 --> 16:35.875
but if I'd done it,
then I'd be smart.

16:35.943 --> 16:36.909
Maybe if you--

16:36.977 --> 16:39.512
If you want it, it turned out,

16:39.580 --> 16:41.848
it would have been a good idea.

16:41.915 --> 16:43.216
Really?

16:43.283 --> 16:45.852
You mean, if I wanted
you to be with me,

16:45.919 --> 16:47.420
you would want that?

16:47.488 --> 16:50.022
Yeah, why not?

16:50.090 --> 16:52.425
Well...

16:52.493 --> 16:54.160
What if there was
something better

16:54.228 --> 16:56.262
that you'd be missing out on?

16:56.329 --> 16:58.363
Like what?

16:58.431 --> 17:00.265
Like...

17:00.333 --> 17:03.468
What if I liked you
and you could tell

17:03.536 --> 17:05.970
and what if you
didn't try to kiss me

17:06.037 --> 17:09.039
and we just-- We sat here

17:09.106 --> 17:12.642
and we talked and we
got to know each other?

17:12.710 --> 17:15.044
I mean, a kiss would
stop that cold.

17:15.112 --> 17:17.713
But if you
don't try to kiss me,

17:17.781 --> 17:21.618
then, um, we'd talk and talk
and say good night,

17:21.685 --> 17:25.187
and maybe we could
see each other again.

17:25.255 --> 17:28.791
And keep talking, and still,
you don't try to kiss me.

17:28.859 --> 17:31.961
Maybe we could get close.

17:32.029 --> 17:36.232
We could start to--
To really like each other.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.901
But we might kiss,
but we don't make out,

17:38.969 --> 17:43.072
You don't touch any
part of my body,

17:43.140 --> 17:47.077
and maybe love would grow.

17:47.144 --> 17:49.312
We'd--

17:49.380 --> 17:52.649
We'd get excited just to
hear each other's voices.

17:52.717 --> 17:56.286
We'd feel pent-up desire.

17:56.354 --> 17:59.189
Then what if we got married?

17:59.256 --> 18:02.292
And you still haven't--

18:02.360 --> 18:03.894
Haven't seen me
in my undergarments,

18:03.962 --> 18:06.497
you haven't touched
any part of me.

18:06.565 --> 18:09.734
Then, on that first night,

18:09.802 --> 18:12.804
we would be together
for the first time.

18:12.872 --> 18:16.775
We could do anything
and everything

18:16.842 --> 18:20.446
and know that the lord
is with us and blesses us.

18:22.783 --> 18:24.317
And because we waited,

18:24.385 --> 18:25.819
that first time
and every time after

18:25.887 --> 18:29.991
would be so passionate
and so free.

18:30.058 --> 18:31.326
I bet you never had sex

18:31.393 --> 18:33.828
one time in your life
like that,

18:33.896 --> 18:38.233
where-- Where there's
no shame, there's no fear,

18:38.301 --> 18:40.602
where you can put all of
yourself in a woman

18:40.670 --> 18:44.172
and leave nothing behind.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.143
Just you and me,
you and your body,

18:48.210 --> 18:52.781
me and my body,
touching, being close,

18:52.849 --> 18:54.583
before God.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.357
This is British Radio
news headlines.

20:01.392 --> 20:04.829
Today in Mogadishu 40
people were slaughtered

20:04.864 --> 20:06.502
by rebel soldiers as they
tried to escape

20:06.537 --> 20:09.458
genocide that has ramped
into that sole African nation.

20:09.493 --> 20:12.398
The rebels reportedly cut the
heads off of their victims

20:12.433 --> 20:14.896
with machetes and mutilated
their corpses

20:14.931 --> 20:18.193
smearing their entrails all
over the faces of their children.

20:18.228 --> 20:21.564
This has been the 10th day in a row
that such attacks have taken place.

20:21.599 --> 20:24.672
So far 50,000 people have
been brutally murdered...

20:24.707 --> 20:29.831
Into the conflict...
Infested river...

20:29.866 --> 20:34.435
Causing dehydratation and starvation
to millions in the region...
