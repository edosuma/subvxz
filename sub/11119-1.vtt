[easygoing music]

00:10.967 --> 00:13.230
[soft music]

00:30.291 --> 00:33.294
- [Todd] Okay, and how
would you like this shipped?

00:33.337 --> 00:35.513
Standard ground takes
seven to 10 business days,

00:35.557 --> 00:36.862
or if you need it tomorrow,

00:36.906 --> 00:38.125
we can overnight it
for an extra $20.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.388
- [Man] Well, I don't
need it tomorrow.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.085
- [Todd] Well, I'm
the supervisor here.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.435
I can knock it
down to 15 for you.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.698
- [Man] Well,
thanks, I'm tempted.

00:46.742 --> 00:47.917
I'm so impatient.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.223
- [Todd] Oh hey, for me,

00:49.266 --> 00:50.789
instant gratification
isn't soon enough.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.443
[both laughing]

00:52.487 --> 00:55.098
- [Man] All right, what the
hell, ship it overnight.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.534
- [Todd] No problem.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.145
And if you have any other
questions, call anytime.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.450
My name is Todd Anderson.
- Hey, thanks Todd.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.495
- You're very welcome.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.325
- Okay, so that's a go.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.328
All right, fine, I'll do it.

01:07.371 --> 01:10.331
[office chattering]

01:13.247 --> 01:14.335
- I need you in my office.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.212
- [Todd] Is this
gonna take a while?

01:22.256 --> 01:24.258
I just ordered from Thai
Garden, and they're pretty fast.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.650
- So you like spicy food?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.391
That's interesting.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.610
Close the door, please.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.526
- Why is that interesting?

01:33.136 --> 01:35.747
- Todd, we've decided to
restructure order fulfillment.

01:37.662 --> 01:38.881
- Restructure how?

01:38.924 --> 01:40.578
- Offshore the whole department.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.233
[Todd scoffing]

01:43.277 --> 01:44.800
- That's a good one.
- I'm not kidding.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.236
Check out this spreadsheet.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.804
Any American job that's
done on the phone or online,

01:48.847 --> 01:50.066
it's goin' overseas.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.720
The savings are incredible.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.374
- This is some kind of
weird psychological test

01:53.417 --> 01:55.245
you're pulling on
me, right, Dave?

01:55.289 --> 01:57.943
This is like a ritual hazing
for the annual review?

01:57.987 --> 01:59.423
- It's not quite time
for your review, Todd.

01:59.467 --> 02:03.123
You've been working here coming
up on 4 1/2 years, not five.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.342
- You can't outsource
order fulfillment.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.215
Half our catalog is
patriotic knick-knacks.

02:08.258 --> 02:11.305
If a factory worker from
Wisconsin calls the 800 number

02:11.348 --> 02:13.872
to buy this and gets a
person in another country,

02:13.916 --> 02:15.047
he's gonna flip out.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.138
- That's where the
accent training comes in.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.402
- You expect me to walk
in there and tell everyone

02:21.445 --> 02:23.752
I'm sorry but your jobs
have been outsourced?

02:24.970 --> 02:25.754
- I'll do it.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.672
[keyboards clacking]

02:30.715 --> 02:32.064
- So I'm fired, too?

02:32.108 --> 02:33.675
- No, not at all.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.155
- But I manage fulfillment.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.721
Now you don't need me here.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.158
- You're right, we
don't need you here.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.250
We need you in India.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.208
Someone's gotta
train the new guy.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.383
- And after that?

02:46.427 --> 02:47.167
- We'll find something for you.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.646
Company's growing.

02:48.690 --> 02:49.604
- We'll find something for you.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.171
- 'Course, you're free to quit.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.870
But you haven't vested
your stock options yet.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.306
Quit now and you give it up.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.829
Plus your pension and medical,

02:57.873 --> 02:59.918
and you'll be out there
in a bad job market

02:59.962 --> 03:02.007
with no unemployment benefits.

03:02.051 --> 03:05.185
Ask these guys in
about 20 minutes.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.186
- No.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.578
No, no way.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.667
No, I'm not going to India
to train my own replacement.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.192
- All you need to do is
visit the call center,

03:12.235 --> 03:13.584
improve their
minutes per incident,

03:13.628 --> 03:15.673
and make sure the new
guy is up to speed.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.460
- What does this
new guy get paid?

03:19.503 --> 03:20.200
- Half a million

03:22.245 --> 03:23.812
rupees.

03:23.855 --> 03:28.295
[laughing] That's $11,000
a year to do your job.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.558
And it's eight heads
for the price of one.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.648
What are you gonna do?

03:33.691 --> 03:35.867
Come on, just get
their MPI down to six.

03:35.911 --> 03:36.955
- No, I'm not going.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.132
- It's just a short trip,
and you like spicy food.

03:40.176 --> 03:43.135
- Dave, I'm not going to India.

03:43.179 --> 03:48.184

[whistle blowing]

04:32.228 --> 04:36.145
[speaking in foreign language]

04:36.188 --> 04:37.233
- [Todd] No, I'm good.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.147
Thanks, no.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.584
I'm meeting someone.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.896
I need to get to
the train station.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.874
Hi, can you take me
to the train station?

05:09.918 --> 05:10.701
Oh, great.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.317
Oh, crap.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.883
No, sir, sorry, I wanted a taxi.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.190
I want a taxi.
- No problem.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.191
[engine starting]
- Okay, sorry.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.235
Thanks.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.454
Let me just grab my bag.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.629
Thanks.

05:25.673 --> 05:26.891
Ow, jeez!

05:26.935 --> 05:28.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:28.502 --> 05:30.460
No, no, stop, stop, stop!

05:30.504 --> 05:34.334
[men clamoring]
Go, go, go!

07:25.619 --> 07:28.622
[bell dinging]
- Hi.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.406
You are liking it, yes?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.582
- Uh, it's interesting.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.671
- It's the best country.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.499
- Uh-huh.
- No problem.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.587
- Um.
- Hey!

07:38.632 --> 07:40.329
No problem, you just jump!
- What?

07:40.372 --> 07:41.548
- You jump!

07:41.591 --> 07:43.593
You must jump, sir!

07:43.637 --> 07:44.899
- There's no room!
- Jump!

07:48.119 --> 07:49.338
You must jump!

07:49.381 --> 07:50.165
Jump!

07:51.340 --> 07:52.123
Jump!

07:55.736 --> 07:56.519
Bye!

08:18.933 --> 08:21.588
[horn blaring]

08:38.648 --> 08:40.432
- [Man] Platform 8.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.044
The next train will
leave Gharapuri Station

08:43.087 --> 08:45.437
from Platform 1 at 5:53.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.701
[soft music]

08:55.578 --> 08:56.753
- I'll take one of those.

08:56.797 --> 09:00.714
[speaking in foreign language]

09:04.587 --> 09:05.806
- No change, no change.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.330
Impossible, no change.
- Oh, that's okay.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.418
I'm dying of thirst.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.245
Keep the change.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.771
Yeah, it's fine.
[speaking in foreign language]

09:14.815 --> 09:17.687
[wheel grinding]

09:20.777 --> 09:22.692
- Hey, hey, come on.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.581
- Are you Mr. Toad?

09:41.624 --> 09:43.234
- Mm, yes.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.453
No.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.760
I'm Todd, Todd Anderson,
Western Novelty.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.631
- I sent a car, but
you were not there.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.980
- I didn't see it.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.852
I had to take one of those
taxi go kart thingies.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.636
- So sorry for the confusion.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.812
I'm so very pleased
to meet you, Mr. Toad.

09:55.856 --> 10:00.164
I am Purohit N. Virajnarianan,
but you can call me Puro.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.557
- Poro?
- Puro.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.993
Come, I'll take
you to your hotel.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.256
Please come, please come.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.214
- Sir!

10:06.257 --> 10:07.128
[speaking in foreign language]

10:07.171 --> 10:08.695
Please come back, I am here!

10:09.826 --> 10:11.698
I am waiting for you!

10:11.741 --> 10:12.524
Good night, good night!

10:12.568 --> 10:13.830
Good morning!

10:13.874 --> 10:16.746

10:22.709 --> 10:26.887
[cows mooing]
[horn honking]

10:29.541 --> 10:31.718
- Do you like India?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.328
- Bombay was a little crazy.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.113
But Gharapuri looks different.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.288
I don't know, cleaner.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.420
- Bombay is terrible.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.377
Terrible.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.683
Gharapuri is very clean.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.686
[urine splashing]

10:43.730 --> 10:45.732
Do you have a business
card, Mr. Toad?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.777
- Yeah, Todd, you can
just call me Todd.

10:47.821 --> 10:48.560
That's fine.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.130
- Okay.

10:53.174 --> 10:57.352
Executive Vice President of
Marketing and Order Fulfillment.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.570
Very impressive.

10:58.614 --> 10:59.876
- It's not as
impressive as it sounds.

11:01.138 --> 11:04.141
What I really do is
sell kitsch to rednecks.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.969
And now I have to train
some other schmuck to do it.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.711
[horn honking]

11:10.147 --> 11:11.888
- [Puro] May I ask a question?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.542
- Yeah, go ahead.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.153
- Would you kindly be
telling me what is kitsch

11:16.197 --> 11:19.679
and what is redneck
and what is schmuck?

11:20.941 --> 11:25.902
- Uh, uh, kitsch is
garbage that people buy.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.167
And redneck basically
means farmer.

11:30.211 --> 11:30.994
- Farmer.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.476
And schmuck?

11:37.653 --> 11:39.568
- Uh, that means
like a nice guy.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.178
So you're the person
I'm here to train?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.702
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize that.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.921
- I'm so very fortunate
to be learning

11:44.965 --> 11:47.924
the ways of American
business from you, Mr. Toad.

11:47.968 --> 11:48.882
- Todd.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.057
Please, just call me Todd.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.930
- Your first trip to India?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.584
- Yes.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.718
Some foreigners who come here
do not experience it well.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.808
But I can tell, you are
of a different breed.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.418
A very good traveler,

12:03.461 --> 12:05.942
strong and ready for anything
and everything [laughing].

12:06.856 --> 12:08.075
- That's very kind of you.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.424
Why do you say that?

12:09.467 --> 12:11.252
- Most foreigners
cannot eat gulab

12:11.295 --> 12:12.644
without becoming very ill.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
- How far to the hotel?

12:19.869 --> 12:22.219
- Your reservation is for
the Gharapuri Palace Hotel.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.091
But that place is very lonely.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.223
I'll take you to
Aunti Ji's guesthouse.

12:26.267 --> 12:29.444
She will take care of you better
than your own real mother.

12:29.487 --> 12:32.360
- No, actually, I think I'd
like to just go to my hotel.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.622
I'm tired, I've been traveling

12:33.665 --> 12:34.884
for days.
- Please, Mr. Toad, I insist.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.581
We go to Aunti Ji's.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.933
She has a very good garden,
most excellent Indian cook,

12:39.976 --> 12:41.195
very hygienic.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.414
You'll not be lonely
there, I am telling you.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.459
- Okay, fine, I'll check it out.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.982
Just make it quick.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.203
- You're a schmuck [laughing].

12:50.944 --> 12:55.862
[horn honking]
[bright music]

13:22.105 --> 13:23.280
There.

13:23.324 --> 13:27.589
This way, please come.
[bell dinging]

13:31.723 --> 13:34.596
[speaking in foreign language]

13:34.639 --> 13:36.163
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.732
You must be exhausted,
all the way from Bombay.

13:40.776 --> 13:41.951
- Oh, no, we're
just here to look.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.474
Whoa, that's okay.

13:43.518 --> 13:46.173
- Look, look, I have some
snacks and tea freshly made,

13:46.216 --> 13:47.827
waiting for you only [laughing].

13:48.784 --> 13:50.742
What is your good name, please?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.222
- My good name?
- Uh-huh.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.224
- He is Mr. Toad, Aunti Ji.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.182
Fresh from America.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.837
- Oh, Mr. Toad, how sweet!

13:57.880 --> 13:58.881
Come in, please.

13:58.925 --> 13:59.664
Come in!

13:59.708 --> 14:01.057
- Come in, come in.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.497
- [Todd] No thanks.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.982
- So, Mr. Toad, what
does your father do?

14:14.679 --> 14:15.985
What is your salary?

14:16.029 --> 14:17.030
Are you married?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.076
- No, I'm not married.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.253
- Ah. you have a
girlfriend, hmm?

14:24.907 --> 14:27.736
- Uh, I did, but we broke
up a couple of months ago.

14:27.779 --> 14:28.868
- Why break up?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.260
You should be married.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.044
Huh?
- Um,

14:33.960 --> 14:37.441
she wanted to start a family
and I wasn't quite ready yet.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.052
- Not yet?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.837
My god, you are old enough
to be a grandfather!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.012
What are you waiting for, huh?

14:45.928 --> 14:47.625
Uh, just eat.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.062
Very nice, fresh.

14:50.846 --> 14:54.067
[upbeat music]

14:54.110 --> 14:55.285
- That's good.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.421
[throat clearing]

15:07.167 --> 15:07.907
What?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.041
- Sir, you should
not place the hand

15:12.085 --> 15:14.826
that has been in your
mouth back in the food.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.354
And uh, you should not
eat with your left hand.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.051
In India, we eat
with the right hand.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.357
- Right.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.143
- Left hand is considered
to be, uh, unclean.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.320
- Unclean, unclean, yes.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.583
- Why?

15:33.715 --> 15:35.108
- Why, uh.
- Why?

15:48.686 --> 15:49.470
- Okay.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.920
[bells tinkling]

16:50.618 --> 16:51.401
Thank you.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.362
That's great.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.494
Okay, that's good.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.105
Thank you.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.237
Thank you.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.702
[speaking in foreign language]

18:06.128 --> 18:08.913
[dramatic music]

18:11.873 --> 18:13.222
- [Puro] We work from
six in the evening

18:13.266 --> 18:14.876
to six in the morning.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.269
Daytime in America.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.705
- [Todd] Doesn't that screw
up your sleep patterns?

18:17.748 --> 18:19.054
- [Puro] No, no, no, no.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
We are accustomed to
the problems by now.

18:22.231 --> 18:25.321
Is it true that
when I'm manager,

18:25.365 --> 18:28.846
I'm going to earn
500,000 rupees a year?

18:28.890 --> 18:30.283
- If that's what they told you.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.504
- Because of my future salary,

18:34.548 --> 18:37.507
I am now engaged
to Bagshi Sasipuli.

18:37.551 --> 18:38.291
- Baggy who?

18:40.945 --> 18:41.729
Watch the,

18:42.643 --> 18:43.731
oh, she's cute.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.302
- She is more beautiful than
[speaking in foreign language].

18:49.345 --> 18:51.173
I've loved her all my life.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.957
I could never think
of marrying her

18:53.001 --> 18:56.570
until Western Novelty hired
me for 500,000 rupees.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.487
[horn honking]

19:07.842 --> 19:09.496
- [Todd] Oh, you
gotta be kidding me.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.845
This is it?

19:10.888 --> 19:13.108
- There is no office
to rent in Gharapuri,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.501
so we had to build one.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.982
Because of outsourcing, all
the real estate in Bombay,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.550
Madras, Bangor, even
Gharapuri, is taken.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.769
So we had to build one.

19:21.812 --> 19:22.596
Please come.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.904
[crowd clamoring]

19:28.428 --> 19:29.646
Please, this way.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.349
This here is the
supervisor's booth.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.350
- [Man] Mr. Puro, please.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.307
Mr. Puro.
- And here

19:38.351 --> 19:40.222
we have the agents' cubicles.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.876
They're working very hard.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.139
- [Man] Mr. Puro, excuse me.

19:44.183 --> 19:44.835
- It's okay.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.318
And because of America, we
have different times zones.

19:50.798 --> 19:54.193
Seattle, New York,
Chicago, and India, also.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.326
- Puro, what is that?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.111
- Oh.

20:00.155 --> 20:03.027
Oh, this.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.901
This is our MPI monitor,
minutes per incident.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.381
This is gonna go up on the wall.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.731
This is the average
time our agent

20:10.774 --> 20:12.211
takes to solve the call-in.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.169
[cow mooing]

20:14.213 --> 20:15.301
What?

20:15.344 --> 20:16.215
Oh, ha ha ha!

20:16.258 --> 20:17.259
Oh, that, that's just a cow.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.304
It must have wandered in.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.218
One minute.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.525
[speaking in foreign language]

20:22.569 --> 20:25.398
Don't worry, Mr. Todd,
we are fully operational.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.269
We have the
state-of-the-art computers,

20:27.313 --> 20:29.532
digital phone lines,
optical mouses, everything.

20:29.576 --> 20:33.536
[speaking in foreign language]

20:37.323 --> 20:40.108
Mr. Toad, are you okay?

20:40.151 --> 20:42.066
- Just kind of a cramp.

20:42.110 --> 20:42.850
- The gulab.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.246
- Oh, God.
[somber music]

20:53.382 --> 20:54.601
- One rupee, one rupee.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.733
- Not a good time.
- One rupee.

20:56.777 --> 20:57.995
- Tomorrow.
- Only one rupee.

20:58.039 --> 20:58.953
- No, I don't have a rupee.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.302
- Please, only one rupee.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.521
- Is that all you can say?

21:01.564 --> 21:03.523
- Hungry, only one rupee.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.351
One, one.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.917
- All right, all
right, one rupee.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.267
Now leave me alone, all right?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.052
No, no, no, don't touch!

21:13.315 --> 21:15.012
Hey!
[boy screaming]

21:15.056 --> 21:20.061
Hey!

21:24.457 --> 21:25.545
[speaking in foreign language]

21:25.588 --> 21:27.895
downstairs,
bathroom, no problem.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.549
[stomach rumbling]

21:29.592 --> 21:32.552
[suspenseful music]

21:39.863 --> 21:42.562
[door slamming]

21:50.831 --> 21:52.049
- No toilet paper.

22:01.755 --> 22:02.712
[Todd exhaling]

22:02.756 --> 22:05.324
[soft music]

22:08.457 --> 22:09.806
- Hello, everyone.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.114
I'm Todd Anderson
from Western Novelty,

22:13.157 --> 22:16.813
and I'm here to help integrate
you into our business.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.120
Now, I gotta tell you,
this center's numbers

22:19.163 --> 22:21.252
are nowhere near
what they should be,

22:21.296 --> 22:24.081
and based on the customer
complaints we've been having,

22:24.125 --> 22:25.126
it's a culture thing.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.782
Basically, you people need
to learn about America.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.351
Now, it's all about
bringing down the MPI.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.917
Things go faster if
the customer feels

22:33.961 --> 22:36.180
they're talking to a
native English speaker.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.313
- But we are native
English speakers.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.620
English is the official
language of our government.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.578
You got it from the
British, and so did we.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.580
We just speak it differently.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.974
I mean, sometimes our
pronunciation is better.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.672
We say internet, and
you say inner-net.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.806
- Fair enough, but
that's exactly my point.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.069
I'm asking you to say inner-net.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.593
Next time you're on a call,

22:57.637 --> 23:00.117
try to listen carefully to
the customer's pronunciation,

23:00.161 --> 23:01.815
to their slang, small talk.

23:01.858 --> 23:02.903
Try to learn from them.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.079
Learn about America.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.385
- Sir.
- Yes?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.516
You are?

23:07.560 --> 23:08.865
- Manmeet.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.606
- Man meat.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.215
- Uh, no, Manmeet.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.481
What I want to know
is what is small talk?

23:15.524 --> 23:16.656
- Oh.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.833
You know, it's like,
how ya doin' today?

23:19.876 --> 23:21.748
How's the weather in Arizona?

23:21.791 --> 23:23.053
You can talk about sports.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.577
- [Man] Like cricket.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.404
- All right nevermind,
forget sports.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.623
You want to sound American.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.974
If anyone asks where you're
located, just say Chicago.

23:31.018 --> 23:31.758
All right?

23:31.801 --> 23:32.672
Try that.

23:32.715 --> 23:33.412
- [All] Chicago.

23:34.935 --> 23:35.849
- Hmm, okay.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.329
Uh, when you make the ah sound,

23:38.373 --> 23:41.507
hold your nose to flatten
the vowel, like Chi-cah-go.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.554
- [All] Chi-cah-go.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.164
[all laughing]

23:47.208 --> 23:48.601
- That's great.

23:48.644 --> 23:51.778
And if anyone asks how the
weather is, just say windy.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.649
- Yes, you are?

23:53.693 --> 23:54.694
- Asha, sir.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.001
Isn't that a little dishonest?

23:58.045 --> 23:59.481
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

23:59.525 --> 24:03.050
I'm not in Chi-cah-go,
I'm in Gharapuri.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.573
When I was hired to do this job,

24:04.617 --> 24:06.009
I was told that I would
be selling products

24:06.053 --> 24:07.533
to a customer on a telephone.

24:07.576 --> 24:09.622
I did not know we
had to be deceptive.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.408
- Well, a lot of Americans
are upset about outsourcing.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.670
- But, sir, most of the products

24:14.714 --> 24:16.150
they're buying
are made in China.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.460
- Uh, okay, we're almost back.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.636
We'll continue this tomorrow.

24:23.679 --> 24:24.680
Thank you.

24:27.727 --> 24:30.556
- It says made in
China on the box.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
It says so on the packet.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.604
[bright music]

24:35.648 --> 24:36.779
- [Todd] Ow.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.172
Hey, stay away from me.
[kids clamoring]

24:38.215 --> 24:39.695
Don't get, don't touch me.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.044
Don't get,

24:43.786 --> 24:44.526
stay away from me.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.571
I'm serious.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.973
[throat clearing]

24:57.017 --> 24:58.714
- [Aunti Ji] Good
morning, Mr. Toad.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.587
You've had a long night, huh?

25:03.632 --> 25:08.158
But you are looking
like you have no energy.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.682
You must go to sleep.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.727
- Oh, I will.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.556
- What you eat, huh?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.036
You're looking sick.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.907
[speaking in foreign language]

25:17.951 --> 25:19.735
- Oh, no, thank you, I can't.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.216
- Mr. Toad,

25:23.783 --> 25:26.394
you want to meet a
nice Indian girl?

25:27.743 --> 25:28.483
- No.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.397
No, thank you.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.660
I'm just really not interested.

25:31.704 --> 25:35.098
- Um, are you homosexual?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.536
- Excuse me?

25:37.579 --> 25:40.713
- Um, you're liking
boys, not Indian girl?

25:41.583 --> 25:44.630
- No.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.327
No.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.808
[speaking in foreign language]

25:48.851 --> 25:49.765
Oh, God, no, thank you.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.637
Really, I can't eat a thing.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.290
- You must eat!

25:53.334 --> 25:54.553
You'll shrivel up into nothing.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.642
Like the skin and
bones only, ha.

25:56.685 --> 25:57.556
- Maybe tomorrow.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.731
I just, I need to get some air.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.603
- Tomorrow?

26:16.400 --> 26:19.186
[easygoing music]

26:49.695 --> 26:51.044
- When is this glass coming?

26:51.087 --> 26:53.786
- [Puro] It is coming
presently, sir.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.875
- Is the call volume
always this low?

26:56.963 --> 26:58.529
- This is low?

26:58.573 --> 26:59.966
- Yes, they're obviously not
routing all the calls here yet.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.794
Why is the MPI so bad?

27:01.837 --> 27:03.056
At twelve minutes per incident,

27:03.099 --> 27:04.840
we're losing money
on every call.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.408
- Bad?

27:07.451 --> 27:09.671
When I started, it was 15.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.499
I brought it down to 12.
- Puro, this place

27:11.542 --> 27:12.413
is a disaster.

27:12.456 --> 27:13.675
If we don't get it down to six,

27:13.719 --> 27:16.373
I'll be stuck in India
the rest of my life.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.506
- We are getting the MPI down.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.725
No problem.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.814
- Don't say no problem
when there is a problem.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.032
If we don't get it down to six,

27:23.076 --> 27:24.338
you'll never get your promotion,

27:24.381 --> 27:27.080
and you'll never get to
marry what's her face.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.690
- Whose face, sir?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.301
- Your girlfriend. Baggy
swami, whatever her name is.

27:34.043 --> 27:37.656
- Everyone, please
go faster and faster.

27:37.699 --> 27:38.482
Okay?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.401
- Great.

27:44.445 --> 27:45.359
Okay, what else?

27:46.403 --> 27:48.449
Yes, Manmeet?

27:48.492 --> 27:52.018
- I do not understand item H403.

27:52.061 --> 27:52.845
- H403.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.938
Ah, a lot of Americans wear
these to sporting events.

27:58.981 --> 27:59.721
- But why, sir?

28:00.766 --> 28:01.897
- It's hard to explain.

28:01.941 --> 28:02.681
We just do.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.509
Yes?

28:05.553 --> 28:07.555
- I don't understand
the purpose of A221.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.296
- A221.

28:10.427 --> 28:11.690
That's a burger brand.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.780
Americans eat a lot of beef,

28:14.823 --> 28:17.913
and some people like to burn
their initials into their food

28:17.957 --> 28:19.785
with a red hot iron
before they eat it.

28:19.828 --> 28:20.829
- Why?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.048
- It's a cattle brand.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.878
You know, the thing you use
to burn a symbol into a cow?

28:27.270 --> 28:28.794
In America, that's how you
keep track of your cows,

28:28.837 --> 28:30.926
is branding.

28:30.970 --> 28:31.927
- With a red hot iron?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.277
- Yeah.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.150
- But, uh, wouldn't
the cow run away?

28:37.193 --> 28:39.065
- Oh no, we only
do it to baby cows,

28:40.544 --> 28:43.286
when they're small
enough to hold them down.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.336
Yes, Asha?

28:49.379 --> 28:50.816
- A suggestion, Mr. Todd.

28:52.121 --> 28:52.861
- Go ahead.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.472
- You need to learn about India.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.130
[bell dinging]

29:06.745 --> 29:07.920
- [Machine] Hey, it's Todd.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.530
I'll be out of the
country for a few days,

29:09.573 --> 29:10.313
so leave me a message and I'll.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.662
[phone dialing]

29:11.706 --> 29:13.577
- [Machine Voice]
You have no messages.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.192
Are you still there?

29:19.235 --> 29:20.933
You have no messages.

29:23.805 --> 29:27.069
[soft music]

29:27.113 --> 29:29.768
[bell ringing]

30:20.253 --> 30:23.343
- [Woman] I told you it's my
grandson's first day at school.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.910
I want to get him some supplies,

30:24.953 --> 30:27.869
but I'm not sure what
kids need these days.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.653
- [Manmeet] Perhaps
some rubbers, ma'am?

30:29.697 --> 30:31.307
- [Woman] What did you say?

30:31.351 --> 30:32.831
- [Manmeet] I mean,
if you have a pencil,

30:32.874 --> 30:34.223
you need some rubbers, no?

30:36.617 --> 30:37.966
- Okay.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.925
Who can tell me what was
wrong with this call?

30:43.754 --> 30:45.060
It's not a rubber,

30:45.104 --> 30:46.888
it's an eraser.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.455
- No, sir, this is a rubber.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.065
- No, it's an eraser.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.894
A rubber means condom.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.461
- Oh, you mean like a flat.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.463
- No, they call it an apartment.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.160
- No, a condom.

30:59.683 --> 31:00.423
Birth control.

31:01.990 --> 31:02.817
- Does it work?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.866
[upbeat music]

31:48.080 --> 31:50.212
- This is Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.910
- [Dave] I just
saw your numbers.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.215
You do realize you're not
on vacation over there?

31:53.259 --> 31:54.782
- Yeah, like I would
come here for a vacation.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.349
- [Dave] Unless you plan
on taking up residence,

31:56.392 --> 31:57.654
you'd better get
the ball rolling.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.874
- Yeah, that's why
I'm calling, actually.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.008
An MPI in the sixes
is not realistic.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.487
- [Dave] I didn't say
in the sixes, Todd.

32:04.531 --> 32:05.401
I said get it down to six.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.143
6:59 is not six, it's seven.

32:08.187 --> 32:10.276
You need to get it down to 6.0.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.407
- Are you kidding me?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.105
We had a deal.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.715
- [Dave] And our last Seattle
agents go offline on Sunday.

32:14.758 --> 32:15.977
Expect a bump in call volume.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.152
- You know what a six
means in this industry.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.762
It means anything below a seven.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.068
That's the definition.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.896
- [Dave] Don't you
read your contracts?

32:21.940 --> 32:25.030
We said get it down to six,
I'm holding you to six.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.597
- Dave, you're a
corporate slimeball.

32:27.641 --> 32:28.903
- [Dave] Watch it, Todd.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.817
Lose your stock
options and you'll

32:29.860 --> 32:31.297
be living in a cardboard box.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.647
- Dave.
- Gotta go.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.562
[dialtone buzzing]

32:35.605 --> 32:36.998
[phone slamming]

32:37.042 --> 32:39.522
[upbeat music]

32:49.054 --> 32:50.055
[horn honking]

32:50.098 --> 32:53.058
[whistle blowing]

32:53.101 --> 32:54.363
[engine starting]

32:54.407 --> 32:57.149
[Todd coughing]

33:17.299 --> 33:19.040
- Julie?

33:19.084 --> 33:19.910
Hey, it's me.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.784
Yeah.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.916
Uh, how ya doin'?

33:25.960 --> 33:28.093
I just wanted to
check in and say hi.

33:31.705 --> 33:32.793
Oh, nothing.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.708
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.015
I miss you.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.062
Oh, I know.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.324
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

33:47.416 --> 33:48.504
Yeah, I know.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.332
I know.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.209
Is somebody there?

34:02.301 --> 34:05.173
[dialtone buzzing]

34:11.440 --> 34:12.224
- Hey.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.232
[Todd screaming]
[bike crashing]

34:20.275 --> 34:24.235
[speaking in foreign language]

34:27.978 --> 34:29.241
- Cheeseburger.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.639
How much to take me to Bombay?

34:37.684 --> 34:40.252
To, uh, Bagatsingh road.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.079
Right now.
- No, no, sir,

34:41.121 --> 34:42.297
Bombay is too far.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.734
Too much back road,
it will damage my car.

34:44.777 --> 34:45.561
It's impossible.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.261
Okay, 6,000 rupees.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.784
- Don't sweat it,
I'm gonna expense it.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.482
- Okay, sir, 5,000
rupees, not a rupee less.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.744
- Whatever.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.268
- Okay, sir, my children
will starve, sir.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.487
I will take you to
Bombay for 4,000 rupees.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.142
[bright music]

35:09.019 --> 35:11.500
[horn honking]

35:16.592 --> 35:17.332
- Hello, sir.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.594
How may I help you, sir?

35:18.638 --> 35:19.726
- Hi, I'd like
two cheeseburgers,

35:19.769 --> 35:20.944
large fries.
- Oh sorry, sir,

35:20.988 --> 35:23.033
but we don't have
cheeseburger here, sir.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.471
- What?

35:25.514 --> 35:28.430
I thought this was McDonald's.
- Oh, sorry sir.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.780
This is Mac Donnells.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.608
- Get the maharaja
veggie burger.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.394
It's as close as
you're gonna get.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.007
- I came all the way from
Gharapuri for a cheeseburger.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.357
- You know they have a real
McDonald's in Gharapuri.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.012
Still can't get a cheeseburger.

35:47.797 --> 35:48.537
You know what India
stands for, don't you?

35:51.279 --> 35:53.325
I'll never do it again.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.505
Did you hear about the guy
who outsourced his own job?

35:59.548 --> 36:01.550
- Mm mm.
- He writes code

36:01.594 --> 36:03.770
in San Francisco,
makes 70 grand a year,

36:03.813 --> 36:07.077
so he hires a guy in Bangalore
to do his job for 12 grand.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.167
His boss thinks
he's telecommuting.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.559
He's got so much free time,

36:10.603 --> 36:12.822
he's thinking about getting
another job just like it.

36:14.389 --> 36:18.480
We've got Indian doctors
reading American X-rays,

36:18.524 --> 36:20.439
lawyers writing briefs.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.397
I'm in customer service.

36:22.441 --> 36:23.616
- Me, too.

36:23.659 --> 36:25.444
- So how long you here for?

36:25.487 --> 36:28.360
- I have to get my MPI
down to a flat six.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.926
- Not in India.

36:29.970 --> 36:33.713
Unless you hired the accent
neutrals away from me.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.368
All you can hope for
here is an eight.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.413
- I can't go home
till I get a six.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.154
- Better find
yourself a wife, then.

36:41.155 --> 36:43.418
- She'd call me toad.
- What?

36:43.462 --> 36:44.332
- My name is Todd.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.768
Everyone says toad.

36:48.728 --> 36:51.121
- Listen, Todd, just
a word of advice,

36:52.079 --> 36:54.386
I remember feeling like you do.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.735
I was resisting India.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.954
Once I gave in, I
did much better.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.442
[window knocking]

37:19.280 --> 37:20.368
- [Man] I don't understand

37:20.412 --> 37:21.674
what's so difficult
about this order.

37:21.717 --> 37:24.503
[Maduri sobbing]

37:24.546 --> 37:26.287
- [Woman] Go for the blue
and I want to stay away

37:26.331 --> 37:27.897
from the horizontal stripes.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.247
- [Manmeet] And may I
ask you, are you married,

37:29.290 --> 37:30.857
miss?
- Married?

37:30.900 --> 37:32.293
No.
- Oh, really?

37:33.773 --> 37:36.732
- [Operator] Look, buddy, I
assure you I'm in Chicago.

37:36.776 --> 37:37.907
- [Man] Yeah, right.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.434
- [Todd] Oh, God

37:42.477 --> 37:44.262
Puro, where've you been?

37:44.305 --> 37:46.089
Things are going crazy here.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.352
I can't have you wandering off.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.093
You're supposed to be
coaching these people.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.486
Maduri's having a
nervous breakdown.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.575
Manmeet hits on every
woman who calls,

37:53.619 --> 37:57.449
and where is the glass
for this goddamn office?

37:57.492 --> 37:58.580
- Very sorry, sir.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.190
Very sorry.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.018
The glass is coming presently.

38:02.976 --> 38:03.846
- What's all this?

38:06.414 --> 38:07.285
- For you, sir.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.199
You don't look well.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.810
This food helps
with the stomach.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.159
All filtered and clean.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.682
Okay for you to eat, no problem.

38:14.944 --> 38:15.728
- Puro.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.253
- Yes, sir.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.038
- I'm sorry.

38:23.562 --> 38:24.302
Thank you.

38:33.354 --> 38:36.096
[hectic music]

39:01.295 --> 39:03.993
[ducks quacking]

39:17.006 --> 39:20.880
[speaking in foreign language]

39:31.717 --> 39:34.546
[foreboding music]

39:53.565 --> 39:55.523
- [Puro] Mr. Toad, stop!

39:57.133 --> 39:58.483
- Puro?

39:58.526 --> 40:01.181
- I'm very sorry, I should've
told you this earlier!

40:01.224 --> 40:03.313
You should not wear good
clothes on this day!

40:03.357 --> 40:04.532
[dramatic music]

40:04.576 --> 40:05.359
Watch out!

40:06.229 --> 40:07.187
[balloon exploding]

40:07.230 --> 40:08.101
- What the?

40:10.451 --> 40:12.018
- I'm very sorry, Mr. Toad.

40:12.061 --> 40:17.023
You should not have worn good
clothes on the day of holy.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.768
- Holy what?

40:22.811 --> 40:24.073
- Just holy.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.424
Celebration of color,
changing of seasons.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.600
I think we can cross that alley.

40:28.643 --> 40:29.818
Don't worry.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.429
I have this, I'll protect you.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.212
Come with me.

40:32.255 --> 40:33.518
Come, come, come.

40:34.693 --> 40:37.435
[kids yelling]

40:42.657 --> 40:44.311
Come, Mr. Toad, come!

40:49.185 --> 40:51.710
[crowd yelling]

41:04.592 --> 41:07.334
Oh, Mr. Toad, are you okay?

41:07.377 --> 41:10.032
[boys laughing]

41:10.076 --> 41:12.034
- Give me one of those.

41:12.078 --> 41:12.861
- Here.

41:16.604 --> 41:19.738
[balloon exploding]
- Oh, that's a good shot!

41:19.781 --> 41:22.262
- I used to play
baseball in college.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.655
- Like cricket, huh?

41:23.698 --> 41:25.395
Very boring game.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.485
- Give me another.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.529
- Here.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.227
[upbeat music]

41:31.271 --> 41:33.316
[both laughing]

41:33.360 --> 41:34.274
Happy holy!

41:35.536 --> 41:36.581
Come, Mr. Toad.

42:01.606 --> 42:03.042
- [Man] Happy holy.

42:05.218 --> 42:07.699
[soft music]

43:20.641 --> 43:21.686
- Any calls?

43:37.005 --> 43:37.745
Need a pen?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.361
Pick any one you want.

43:45.405 --> 43:46.188
No, not all.

43:52.238 --> 43:53.152
That's pretty good.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.765
- Oh, my God, we
must go, we are late.

43:57.809 --> 43:59.941
- We can't go like this.

43:59.985 --> 44:01.682
- No problem, I'll take
care of it on the way.

44:01.726 --> 44:03.075
Come quickly.

44:03.118 --> 44:05.860
[hectic music]

44:18.003 --> 44:19.526
- Sorry, somebody had to.

44:19.569 --> 44:20.353
- No, thank you.

44:20.396 --> 44:21.789
I'm sorry we're late.

44:21.833 --> 44:22.790
It's holy.

44:25.924 --> 44:29.275
- Sorry, and thank you, Asha.

44:29.318 --> 44:30.406
- Thank you, sir.

44:43.158 --> 44:44.464
- [Maduri] Yes, sir,
thank you very much.

44:44.507 --> 44:46.684
Thank you for shopping
with Western Novelty.

44:59.914 --> 45:01.786
- Uh, before everyone takes off,

45:01.829 --> 45:03.570
I'd like to call
a little meeting.

45:05.006 --> 45:09.054
I want to apologize to all
of you, and especially Asha.

45:09.097 --> 45:10.403
She was right.

45:10.446 --> 45:12.840
I need to learn about India.

45:12.884 --> 45:14.886
- Sir, there's no need to.
- No, no, wait, let me finish.

45:14.929 --> 45:16.191
Please.

45:16.235 --> 45:18.280
Our first mistake has
been trying to run this

45:18.324 --> 45:19.934
like an American office.

45:19.978 --> 45:22.241
So I want to ask you how can
we do things differently?

45:22.284 --> 45:25.374
What would make your work day
a more positive experience?

45:25.418 --> 45:26.767
Yes, Sanji?

45:26.811 --> 45:31.337
- Sir, may I bring in my
family pictures for my desk?

45:31.380 --> 45:32.860
- Yes, bring
pictures of them all.

45:32.904 --> 45:35.080
I want to see the whole family.

45:35.123 --> 45:35.907
What else?

45:37.038 --> 45:38.605
Krishna.

45:38.648 --> 45:41.913
- Sir, may I bring
murties for my desk?

45:41.956 --> 45:42.696
- Murties?

45:42.740 --> 45:43.479
Absolutely.

45:43.523 --> 45:44.785
Whatever those are.

45:44.829 --> 45:45.830
Anyone can bring
whatever they want

45:45.873 --> 45:47.135
to make their space their own,

45:47.179 --> 45:49.137
as long as it doesn't
get in the way of work.

45:49.181 --> 45:49.964
Maduri.

45:50.008 --> 45:50.748
- Uh, sir,

45:52.358 --> 45:54.839
Puro said that, uh, we must
only wear Western clothes

45:54.882 --> 45:56.362
at the Western business.

45:56.405 --> 45:57.711
- Wear whatever you want.

45:59.974 --> 46:00.845
- Uh, yes.

46:00.888 --> 46:02.629
Um, what is your good name?

46:02.672 --> 46:03.891
- I'm Jahnissa.

46:03.935 --> 46:05.806
Sir, would it be possible
to get a discount

46:05.850 --> 46:07.112
on Western Novelty products?

46:08.853 --> 46:10.811
- Is there something
in particular you
were interested in?

46:10.855 --> 46:14.075
- Sir, number D100,
astrology placemats.

46:14.119 --> 46:15.860
- You want those cheesy things?

46:17.687 --> 46:19.820
I'm sure we could get
you a set for free.

46:22.692 --> 46:24.042
Uh, yes?

46:24.085 --> 46:26.653
- What about the ceramic basket?

46:27.697 --> 46:29.395
- Do you guys want this stuff?

46:29.438 --> 46:31.049
You like what
Western is selling?

46:31.092 --> 46:32.441
- [All] Yeah.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.401
- All right, all right.

46:35.444 --> 46:36.924
Here's what we'll do.

46:36.968 --> 46:38.578
I'll call the company
and ask them to ship us

46:38.621 --> 46:41.015
a collection of the most
popular items in the catalog.

46:41.059 --> 46:43.975
Whoever improves their MPI
the most on a given day

46:44.018 --> 46:45.933
can take their pick
of the merchandise.

46:47.456 --> 46:48.327
All right.
[all applauding]

46:48.370 --> 46:49.110
Great job today, everyone.

46:49.154 --> 46:50.372
Thank you.

46:50.416 --> 46:52.853
See you tomorrow.
[bright music]

46:52.897 --> 46:55.421
[cow mooing]

47:04.299 --> 47:05.823
What's that?
- Masala.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.781
Rock salt, cumin, chili pepper.

47:07.825 --> 47:08.738
Makes it better.

47:11.524 --> 47:12.307
Ah!

47:16.094 --> 47:17.965
Nice?
- Oh, wow.

47:19.358 --> 47:20.576
Uh, mm, mm-hmm.

47:22.361 --> 47:23.753
Okay.

47:23.797 --> 47:25.233
Ah.

47:25.277 --> 47:28.019
- When I was young, holy was
the favorite day of the year.

47:28.062 --> 47:29.759
I used to await it eagerly.

47:29.803 --> 47:30.673
- For me it was Halloween.

47:30.717 --> 47:31.892
You know Halloween?

47:31.936 --> 47:33.720
The costumes.
- Oh, yeah.

47:33.763 --> 47:36.070
- My mom used to make us
these great homemade costumes.

47:38.072 --> 47:39.117
It's funny.
- Hmm?

47:39.160 --> 47:40.858
- I keep thinking
about my parents.

47:42.990 --> 47:44.949
- You miss them, of course.

47:44.992 --> 47:46.864
- When I'm home, I
don't miss them at all.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.909
- Because you see them.
- Not much.

47:48.953 --> 47:49.867
Hardly ever.

47:50.955 --> 47:52.913
- You don't live
with your parents?

47:52.957 --> 47:53.958
- No.

47:54.001 --> 47:55.524
[laughing] No.

47:55.568 --> 47:58.701
No, they live in Yakima,
which is about two hours away.

47:58.745 --> 48:00.790
- But you see them every week?

48:00.834 --> 48:03.054
- No, a few times a year.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.707
- But why?

48:04.751 --> 48:06.840
You're so close.

48:06.884 --> 48:07.667
- I don't know.

48:09.103 --> 48:12.541
- Some things I don't
understand about American life.

48:12.585 --> 48:14.108
You don't live
with your parents?

48:14.152 --> 48:14.892
Strange.

48:15.762 --> 48:17.024
Another thing,

48:17.068 --> 48:18.373
you hate your boss.

48:18.417 --> 48:20.071
And you don't like this company.

48:20.114 --> 48:21.115
Hmm?

48:21.159 --> 48:23.074
Why not choose something else?

48:23.117 --> 48:24.684
Hmm?

48:24.727 --> 48:26.251
- I don't know
how to explain it.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.995
In my world, it just makes
sense to work your ass off

48:31.038 --> 48:33.127
and go into credit card debt

48:33.171 --> 48:36.000
just so you can have
that 50 inch plasma.

48:38.089 --> 48:41.092
- You like the SDSI or
digi black, which one?

48:44.704 --> 48:47.446
- Um, they're both good.

48:53.104 --> 48:55.889
[easygoing music]

49:21.784 --> 49:25.092
[operators chattering]

49:56.645 --> 49:58.343
- Todd, that's my family.

49:59.953 --> 50:01.085
- That's impressive.

50:09.267 --> 50:10.877
Asha, could you
come here, please?

50:21.409 --> 50:23.498
Okay, here's the deal.

50:23.542 --> 50:24.804
You're the best we have,

50:24.847 --> 50:27.067
and I've seen you giving
advice to the others.

50:27.111 --> 50:28.373
And after I leave,

50:28.416 --> 50:30.027
Puro's gonna need an
assistant manager.

50:31.332 --> 50:34.770
Now, we have to get
the MPI down to 6.0.

50:35.945 --> 50:36.729
Can you help us?

50:38.861 --> 50:39.558
- Of course.

50:43.823 --> 50:45.912
- You think she can do it?

50:47.522 --> 50:49.133
- I think Asha can do anything.

50:50.482 --> 50:52.266
Congratulations
on your promotion.

50:52.310 --> 50:53.267
You only have to
step in on a call

50:53.311 --> 50:54.355
if someone's really in trouble.

50:54.399 --> 50:56.444
Puro, you wanna get her started?

50:58.098 --> 50:59.056
- Come.

50:59.099 --> 51:00.318
You know about this?

51:00.361 --> 51:01.101
- Yes, sir.

51:05.758 --> 51:07.151
- [Manmeet] You're
welcome, ma'am.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.196
Anytime you call us on
this number, ask for me.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.285
My name is Manmeet.

51:11.329 --> 51:13.809
Have a nice day, ma'am.

51:13.853 --> 51:16.508
[phone ringing]

51:17.857 --> 51:19.554
- Western Novelty, Gharapuri.

51:19.598 --> 51:21.252
- [Dave] What the hell
is wrong with you, Todd?

51:21.295 --> 51:23.167
Are you trying to bankrupt us?

51:23.210 --> 51:25.125
- What are you talking
about, have you seen the MPI?

51:25.169 --> 51:26.561
- [Dave] I'm talking
about this request to ship

51:26.605 --> 51:28.259
hundreds of our
products to India.

51:28.302 --> 51:30.087
The agents can see what
they look like online.

51:30.130 --> 51:31.566
They don't need to fondle them.

51:31.610 --> 51:32.350
- Actually, they do.

51:32.393 --> 51:33.655
It's an incentive.

51:33.699 --> 51:35.266
They need to understand
what they're selling.

51:35.309 --> 51:36.963
- [Dave] So, promise them
the stuff, all right?

51:37.006 --> 51:38.834
Just say it got held
up by a shipping delay.

51:38.878 --> 51:39.792
It's customs.

51:39.835 --> 51:41.141
You gotta think bottom line.

51:41.185 --> 51:42.360
- I am.

51:42.403 --> 51:43.970
That's why I want to
introduce our products

51:44.013 --> 51:45.885
to a potential new market
of a billion people.

51:48.322 --> 51:50.019
Are you there?

51:50.063 --> 51:53.806
- I'll overnight it to you.
[dialtone buzzing]

52:00.595 --> 52:01.292
- It's working.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.819
- Your incentive program
is a very good idea, sir.

52:06.862 --> 52:08.255
I'm learning so much from you.

52:08.299 --> 52:09.822
- I just can't believe
they're so excited

52:09.865 --> 52:11.650
about this tacky stuff.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.217
- Tacky?

52:13.260 --> 52:14.218
What is tacky?

52:15.175 --> 52:17.960
- Oh, uh tacky's like,

52:22.051 --> 52:22.965
no, never mind.

52:31.322 --> 52:32.323
Hey.

52:33.933 --> 52:36.065
Now, I've noticed
that almost everyone

52:36.109 --> 52:38.372
has signed up for the
incentive program except you.

52:38.416 --> 52:39.330
Don't you want anything?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.245
- What would I do with this?

52:41.288 --> 52:42.246
I'm a vegetarian.

52:46.119 --> 52:47.468
- Maybe it works with carrots.

52:49.470 --> 52:53.126
- You Americans have
more choices than
anyone in the world.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.258
Why would you choose this?

52:55.259 --> 52:57.217
- Actually, I got mine in red.

52:58.566 --> 52:59.611
[Asha laughing]

52:59.654 --> 53:02.353
[upbeat music]

53:07.314 --> 53:08.750
- Of all the town.

53:08.794 --> 53:09.577
- Hello.

53:12.537 --> 53:14.321
- You know how to, sorry.

53:14.365 --> 53:16.323
- Of all the gin
joints in all the towns

53:16.367 --> 53:19.283
in all the world, she
had to walk into mine.

53:21.676 --> 53:23.722
- You know how to
whistle, don't you?

53:23.765 --> 53:26.420
Just put your lips
together and blow.

53:26.464 --> 53:27.552
- Shut up, just shut up!

53:27.595 --> 53:29.336
You had me on hello.

53:29.380 --> 53:33.993
- My mama always said life
is like a box of chocolates.

53:34.036 --> 53:36.430
- I have one word
for you, plastics.

53:37.301 --> 53:40.304
[dramatic music]

53:41.435 --> 53:43.350
- Are you talking to me?

53:43.394 --> 53:46.353
- No, okay see, now it's
not are you talking to me,

53:46.397 --> 53:48.225
it's you talkin' to me?

53:48.268 --> 53:49.269
These are called reductions,

53:49.313 --> 53:51.228
and Americans do
them all the time.

53:51.271 --> 53:53.404
Got to go becomes gotta go.

53:53.447 --> 53:55.232
Would he becomes wouldhe.

53:55.275 --> 53:56.624
Jam those words together.

53:56.668 --> 53:57.930
Okay, try it again.

53:57.973 --> 53:59.410
Maybe with a little
more ferocity this time.

54:02.195 --> 54:03.370
- You talking to me?

54:05.372 --> 54:07.113
You talkin' to me!

54:07.983 --> 54:09.550
- Wow, that was very nice.

54:09.594 --> 54:13.119
I believe it.
[audience applauding]

54:13.162 --> 54:14.512
Okay, who else is ready to go?

54:16.165 --> 54:18.037
- Now we have something for you.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.430
- What?

54:19.473 --> 54:20.866
- You will do a dance
from an Indian movie.

54:20.909 --> 54:23.434
You will be Salman Khan.
[audience cheering]

54:23.477 --> 54:24.522
- No, what?

54:24.565 --> 54:25.784
- Go on, sir.

54:25.827 --> 54:27.481
Dance, dance.

54:27.525 --> 54:31.703
[bright music]
- Come, sir.

54:31.746 --> 54:33.008
[audience clapping]

54:33.052 --> 54:34.401
- I can't do that.

54:41.713 --> 54:44.585
- Condor, dance,
don't let us down!

54:45.760 --> 54:46.761
That's nice!

55:27.454 --> 55:28.934
- You iron my underwear?

55:30.065 --> 55:32.372
- Of course,
doesn't your mother?

55:38.291 --> 55:40.337
- Yeah, I'm not sure
what she's referring to

55:40.380 --> 55:42.556
because that product doesn't
actually require batteries.

55:42.600 --> 55:46.125
- Mr. Todd, Mr. Puro,
we have a problem.

55:47.474 --> 55:49.346
The shipment from
Western Novelty

55:49.389 --> 55:51.304
has gone to the wrong city.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.958
- What, where did it go?

55:53.001 --> 55:54.394
- They didn't write
down the pin numbers,

55:54.438 --> 55:56.004
so now they've sent
the entire shipment

55:56.048 --> 55:57.571
to the other Gharapuri.

55:57.615 --> 55:59.007
- Oh, great.

55:59.051 --> 56:00.705
There's another Gharapuri?

56:00.748 --> 56:03.969
- Three hours' drive, maybe
six, depending on traffic.

56:04.012 --> 56:06.928
And you're going to have
to take a ferry from there.

56:06.972 --> 56:07.886
- It's an island?

56:09.496 --> 56:11.846
And there just happens
to be a 114 MG Road

56:11.890 --> 56:13.370
in the other Gharapuri?

56:13.413 --> 56:15.546
- Every town in
India has MG Road.

56:15.589 --> 56:17.156
It stands for Mahatma Gandhi.

56:17.199 --> 56:18.418
He was the father of our nation.

56:18.462 --> 56:19.854
- Right, okay.

56:19.898 --> 56:21.552
Can you take care of this?
- No problem.

56:21.595 --> 56:23.641
But first I must
sleep for two hours.

56:23.684 --> 56:25.338
So that I can come
back for the interviews

56:25.382 --> 56:26.513
of the new agents.

56:26.557 --> 56:28.297
And then I must make
sure that my mother

56:28.341 --> 56:30.430
gets to the hospital.
- Never mind, I'll go.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.606
If we lose the incentives,
everything falls apart.

56:32.650 --> 56:34.652
- But someone
should go with you.

56:34.695 --> 56:37.350
- If we leave now, we
can be back before night.

56:37.394 --> 56:39.396
- You want to go with him?

56:39.439 --> 56:41.267
- I'm the future
assistant manager.

56:41.310 --> 56:42.660
Right?

56:42.703 --> 56:45.489
[upbeat music]

56:51.756 --> 56:53.279
- [Todd] I'm pretty
sure there's a painting

56:53.322 --> 56:54.585
of her in my room.

56:54.628 --> 56:56.456
I feel like she's
following me around.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.721
- That's Kali, the
goddess of destruction.

57:04.508 --> 57:08.337
- Why would you want the goddess
of destruction in your car?

57:08.381 --> 57:10.557
- Sometimes destruction
is a good thing.

57:10.601 --> 57:12.907
She ends one cycle so
a new one can begin.

57:14.474 --> 57:16.171
Why don't you ask
her for something?

57:17.695 --> 57:18.435
- All right.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.613
Destroy something for
me so I'll understand.

57:24.876 --> 57:28.227
[trunk slamming]

57:28.270 --> 57:30.838
[Asha laughing]

57:52.338 --> 57:54.688
[speaking in foreign language]

57:54.732 --> 57:58.518
- We have to, um, get a ferry,
and he will wait here for us.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.216
Come.

58:09.224 --> 58:12.619
[horn bellowing]

58:12.663 --> 58:14.186
- [Todd] Oh my God, look.

58:14.229 --> 58:15.492
Her hat, look at her hat.

58:16.928 --> 58:18.016
That's our product.

58:18.059 --> 58:20.148
Western item D334.
- Yeah.

58:21.149 --> 58:22.455
- Wow, I've never actually seen

58:22.499 --> 58:24.239
one of our customers
in the flesh before.

58:25.719 --> 58:26.720
What's with all the tourists?

58:26.764 --> 58:28.374
- Oh, some famous caves.

58:29.767 --> 58:31.638
- [Todd] I don't think it
feels like India anymore.

58:36.556 --> 58:37.644
- I could do it, you know.

58:39.037 --> 58:39.951
- Do what?

58:39.994 --> 58:41.213
- Your accent.

58:41.256 --> 58:42.693
If I had to, I could do it.

58:45.609 --> 58:47.524
I'll take one of
them cheesehead hats.

58:50.178 --> 58:51.745
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
madam, no problem.

58:51.789 --> 58:53.312
We'll have your cheese hat.

58:53.355 --> 58:55.401
What size did you
wish to purchase?

58:55.444 --> 58:57.751
- You're not one of them
outsourcers, are you?

58:57.795 --> 58:59.274
What's your name?

58:59.318 --> 59:00.841
- Oh, my name is Larry.

59:00.885 --> 59:02.974
May I kindly be having
your credit card number?

59:03.017 --> 59:06.455
- If you're an American,
what's our national bird?

59:06.499 --> 59:09.676
Oh, yeah, yeah, it is a big
vulture with a white head.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.722
- Let me speak to
your supervisor.

59:11.765 --> 59:12.679
- Certainly, sir.

59:12.723 --> 59:14.202
Hello, I'm the supervisor.

59:14.246 --> 59:15.464
How may I be helping you?

59:15.508 --> 59:17.641
- You sound just
like the other guy!

59:17.684 --> 59:19.381
- Now sir, some of
us do sound alike.

59:19.425 --> 59:21.558
There are over one
billion of us, you know.

59:23.647 --> 59:25.039
[Asha laughing]

59:25.083 --> 59:26.650
- That's terrible.

59:30.436 --> 59:31.568
- [Todd] So bad.

59:33.744 --> 59:36.573
[bright music]

01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:17.614
Nice.

01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:19.833
I guess we could let
him keep his table.

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.748
But how do we get it
back to the ferry?

01:00:41.899 --> 01:00:42.856
What's that?

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.640
- [Asha] It's a temple.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:48.993
- [Todd] A temple for what?

01:00:49.036 --> 01:00:50.211
- [Asha] A Shiva Lingam.

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:56.783
- What's a Lingam?

01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:00.482
- Well, you know.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:05.705
The male part.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:08.795
- Huh.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.276
- Hey, Todd, Todd,

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.799
If you're going in,
take off your shoes.

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:25.943
- It's the, uh, the male part?

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:29.381
- It's a symbol of creation.

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.689
- And the The female part?

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.734
- Yes, they go together.

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:35.561
- Mm.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.738
- You see, Shiva was
a very powerful god

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.784
and he grew tired
of the cycle of life

01:01:40.827 --> 01:01:42.786
and death and reincarnation,

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:45.614
so he decided to give up
the pleasures of life,

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:48.139
and he smeared his body in ash.

01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:49.749
- Ash?

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:51.708
- Yes, and he
didn't eat or drink

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.797
or indulge in any
physical pleasure,

01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:58.889
and this created a
terrible fire within him.

01:01:58.932 --> 01:01:59.803
- Well, sure.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.850
- And it transformed him
into a blazing lingam

01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.983
which threatened to
destroy all creation.

01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:10.596
And the other gods
didn't know what to do,

01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:13.817
so a yoni appeared, the
symbol of the goddess.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.429
And she absorbed
this terrible heat,

01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.083
restoring balance to the world

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.476
and saving the universe
from destruction.

01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.613
- Wow, close call.

01:02:28.483 --> 01:02:29.354
- [Woman] Fresh mangoes.

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.572
Good mangoes.

01:02:30.616 --> 01:02:31.965
[speaking in foreign language]

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.097
- Do you want a mango?

01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:34.968
- Sure.

01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.023
- Have you ever
eaten a mango before?

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:47.981
- Mm-mm, first time.

01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:48.895
This is great.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.160
- Eat like this.

01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:00.428
- [Man] Hello, sir.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:04.868
You needing nice room?

01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:06.826
- Need a room?

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:07.958
No, taking the ferry.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:09.916
- The ferries?

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.788
Not happening.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.180
I get you large room.

01:03:13.224 --> 01:03:14.355
Very good price.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.792
- The ferry's not happening?

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.924
- Yeah, ferry's blowing up.

01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:19.926
Everyone will stay here.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.102
I get you really nice room, sir.

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.104
- Right.

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:25.279
Ferry blowing up.

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:32.199
[crowd yelling]
[fire crackling]

01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:38.727
- Sir, I get you
large room on island

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.686
for very special price.

01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:52.829
Come on, sir.

01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.792
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:00.749
Welcome.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:01.968
- Afternoon.

01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:06.364
Uh, I guess we'll take
two standard rooms.

01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.280
- No, sir, standard rooms.

01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:10.498
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:04:11.543 --> 01:04:13.023
- Two deluxe rooms.

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:15.852
- Oh, unfortunately, sir, the
deluxe room's already taken.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:17.679
We have only one
room available, sir.

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:21.988
- The luxury suite?

01:04:22.032 --> 01:04:25.035
- Oh no, luxury suite
are not yet built, sir.

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.514
But we've only one
room available,

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:28.473
and the foreigners
are very happy, sir.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.651
- Oh.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.438
[soft music]

01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:56.066
Okay, that's good.

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:57.937
[speaking in foreign language]

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.112
Yeah, that's great.

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.071
Yeah, thank you, sir,

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:02.594
that's fine.
- Just give him money.

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:07.816
- Uh, sir, that's,
that's enough.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.948
That's good.
- Thank you.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:15.041
- Okay, thank you,
thanks for everything.

01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:25.834
Well, this is
incredibly awkward.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.402
- [Asha] Why are you surprised?

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:31.275
- Oh, this is my fault?

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.624
- Of course it's your fault.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.017
You asked Kali to
destroy something!

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.627
It's not a joke,

01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:36.584
she blew up the ferry
and now we're stuck here!

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:37.846
You told me to.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.196
You said sometimes
destruction can be good.

01:05:39.239 --> 01:05:41.067
- How can this be a good thing?

01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.764
How can I tell my parents
I spent the night with you

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.505
in the Kama Sutra Hotel?

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.943
- Well, I'm not gonna tell them.

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:48.770
- You're standing downstairs
at reception desk,

01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:51.121
sleazy guy, and he's saying
this room is not available

01:05:51.164 --> 01:05:52.905
and that room is not available.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.907
And you just say oh.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.039
Why didn't you say anything?

01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:57.301
- Why didn't you say anything?

01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:58.302
I don't know how
this country works.

01:05:58.345 --> 01:05:59.868
- I can't even talk to you

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:01.348
with that stupid mango
all over your face.

01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:03.089
- I don't have mango
all over my face.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:05.483
- It's all over your face.

01:06:05.526 --> 01:06:07.093
- Is it?
- Yeah!

01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.228
- Did I get it?
- No.

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:14.796
- Well, I can't see it.
[Asha laughing]

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.623
Is it?

01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.539
Help me out, I can't.

01:06:52.486 --> 01:06:54.184
What about the deer in the hair?

01:06:57.187 --> 01:06:59.015
- Look at the coupling
with the swans.

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:00.059
- Wow.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:07.849
Oh my God!

01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:11.505
- No.
- Monkey pulls the turnip.

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:14.421
No, that, that is impossible.

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.814
- Come on, let's try it.

01:07:15.857 --> 01:07:17.120
- No.
- Yeah yeah, let's try it.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:17.903
- No!
- What, you said

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:19.557
I should learn.
- No!

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.384
- Wow.

01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.255
Okay.

01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:28.696
- Todd, no one must
know about this.

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:31.351
It must be a secret.

01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:33.527
We stayed in different
rooms in different hotels,

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:35.312
and nothing happened.
- Of course.

01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:36.095
I understand.

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:38.576
[bright music]

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:42.145
[Todd screeching]

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:46.062
[singing in foreign language]

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:57.551
- Okay, listen to this.

01:07:58.509 --> 01:07:59.771
Press that.

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:03.079
[whimsical music]

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:05.168
So now when I call you,

01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:08.040
you will have your own
official Bollywood ring tone.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.651
It's part of your continuing
education in India.

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:11.565
- Thanks.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.401
Uh, well, have a good
afternoon, Miss Asha.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:23.577
- I'll see you at
work, Mr. Toad.

01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:30.541
[kids clamoring]

01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:36.850
Hey, kid!

01:08:45.077 --> 01:08:47.252
Yeah, that's for
you, to draw, paint.

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:48.559
Yeah, sure, oh.

01:08:55.218 --> 01:08:56.219
- Hello!

01:08:58.438 --> 01:08:59.221
- Hey!

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:02.399
Hey, did you see that?

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:03.487
Unbelievable.

01:09:08.318 --> 01:09:11.147
- [Asha] Mr. Todd, please go
to line 15, we have a problem.

01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:16.152
Hi.

01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:19.154
- Hi.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.853
Is this an empty line?

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:22.680
- Yes.

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:25.291
- Well, hello.

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:26.901
- Very nice to chat with you.

01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.948
- You said there was a problem?

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:31.906
- Yes, sir, the problem
is I have to sit

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:34.430
three feet away from you
and I can't come any closer.

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:38.435
- Yes, that is a problem.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.479
Perhaps we could
solve that after work.

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:43.831
- I'm afraid that
might not be possible.

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:46.051
But perhaps if we leave
separately and go to the market,

01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:47.792
we could meet there.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.837
- Well, ma'am, I have
to say your perfume

01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:51.404
is driving me crazy.

01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:53.841
Is there any way we could
expedite this order?

01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:56.496
- If I may correct you,
sir, it is not perfume.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.802
It is cardamom.

01:09:57.845 --> 01:09:59.020
We live next to
a spice merchant,

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:00.848
and he grinds cardamom all day.

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.328
It gets in all our clothes.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.331
- I like it.

01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:10.467
- I'm glad you like it, sir.

01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:14.166
- You're lucky he
doesn't sell garlic.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.777
[Asha laughing]

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.608
- Yes I am, sir.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:24.176
[soft music]

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.506
Hey, act normal.

01:10:49.549 --> 01:10:51.551
My neighbor's wife is
buying cabbages over there.

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:52.291
Come this way.

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:57.514
[speaking in foreign language]

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.433
I think we're okay now.

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:06.914
Don't touch me, not in public.

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:11.223
But I can help you
down the stairs.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:16.272
- Well, thank you.
[Asha laughing]

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.405
- [Todd] The MPI's
almost down to six.

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:21.189
I'll have to leave soon.

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.279
- [Asha] I know, Puro told me.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:29.372
- [Todd] You ever think
about living in the U.S.?

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.333
- [Asha] I would miss my
parents, it would be too hard.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:36.727
Have you ever thought
of living here?

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.685
- [Todd] Here?

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:43.168
I would, but I I think I'd miss
my hot dog toaster too much.

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.302
We're very close.

01:11:48.086 --> 01:11:49.392
- [Asha] How close?

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:51.524
- [Todd] Oh, I can't
really go into it.

01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.570
- That's not a good thing.

01:11:53.613 --> 01:11:55.398
- Hey, come in for some tea.

01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:58.096
- No, I can't, not
where you're staying.

01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.793
People might talk, no?

01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:01.142
- So what if they talk?

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:03.231
- I should be more careful.

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:06.278
I can't be seen with
you speaking like this.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.584
- Like how?

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:09.150
- Intensely.

01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:11.588
- Oh, come on,
you're a free woman.

01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:13.590
Why can't you speak
intensely if you want?

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:15.766
Why do you worry so
much what people think?

01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:26.951
- Because I'm engaged
to be married.

01:12:29.432 --> 01:12:30.215
- Engaged?

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:32.260
- [Asha] Yes.

01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:39.355
- How long have
you been engaged?

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:41.357
- Since I was four years old.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.447
Our families have known
each other for generations.

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.492
His name is Ashauk.

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:47.493
He has a very good job.

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:48.407
He's very polite.

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:51.279
We'll be married in July.

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:57.460
- Do you love him?

01:12:59.244 --> 01:12:59.984
- Not yet.

01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:04.162
- I can't believe this.

01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:09.994
I just can't believe
that someone as strong

01:13:10.037 --> 01:13:12.997
and smart and as
opinionated as you

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.868
would settle for an
arranged marriage.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.784
- I'll learn to love him.

01:13:17.828 --> 01:13:21.135
- [Todd] What about your
right to choose for yourself?

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:22.920
- My parents met each
other on their wedding day.

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.008
They love each other.

01:13:25.183 --> 01:13:26.880
- To me, that's crazy.

01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:30.318
- Some people would
say America's 50%
divorce rate is crazy.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.411
- Will you tell Ashauk about us?

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.890
- No, of course not.

01:13:36.934 --> 01:13:37.935
No one must know.

01:13:40.677 --> 01:13:43.201
- So what do you call this,
what you and I are doing?

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:46.770
- Holiday in Goa.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:49.947
- What?

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:51.818
- It's something my
friends and I say.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.300
A friend of mine, Prianka,
she fell in love with a boy

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:57.563
one month before she
had to get married.

01:13:57.607 --> 01:13:58.999
He was a boy from her school.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:03.177
So she told her parents she
was under a lot of stress

01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:05.484
and she had to go for
a holiday in Goa alone.

01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:10.315
So she and the boy
went to the beach,

01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:11.751
they had three weeks together,

01:14:13.187 --> 01:14:14.841
then she came back
and got married.

01:14:17.148 --> 01:14:18.715
- Oh.

01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:21.326
So I'm just your holiday in Goa?

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:25.548
- Not just.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.290
My only holiday in Goa.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.428
- [Todd] Sorry.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:37.255
Sorry.

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:47.352
So where can we go to be alone?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.622
- Shake my hand like a
businessperson and go inside.

01:14:56.666 --> 01:14:58.581
- Uh, it was a pleasure
talking with you,

01:14:58.624 --> 01:14:59.625
Miss?
- Batwagaver.

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:03.411
[upbeat music]

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:24.389
- [Man] Hey.

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:28.262
Hey.

01:15:28.306 --> 01:15:29.655
[speaking in foreign language]

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:30.700
- Hi.

01:15:34.007 --> 01:15:35.008
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't know,

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:36.140
I don't have any.

01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:40.144
[speaking in foreign language]

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.582
You want me to come over?

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:44.583
- Aha.

01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:48.500
[speaking in foreign language]

01:15:55.812 --> 01:15:57.857
[water splashing]

01:15:57.901 --> 01:16:01.208
[men clamoring]

01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:03.776
[soft music]

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:14.804
- Namaste.

01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:17.197
- Namaste.

01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:42.396
[bell ringing]

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:55.235
[electricity whirring]

01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:16.430
[happy music]

01:18:58.995 --> 01:19:01.606
[phone ringing]

01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:17.796
- Hello.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.276
- [Dave] It's Dave.

01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:20.538
- Did you see our numbers?

01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:22.061
- [Dave] No, I was traveling.

01:19:22.105 --> 01:19:23.933
- Do you need me to go
through them with you?

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:25.804
- [Dave] No, I need a ride.

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:26.849
- A ride?

01:19:26.892 --> 01:19:28.459
- [Dave] I'm at
the train station.

01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.548
I just got here from Bombay,
it was a damn nightmare.

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:31.854
Get over here and pick me up.

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.770
[dialtone buzzing]

01:19:35.988 --> 01:19:36.815
- Wait one minute.

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.136
Dave.

01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:55.878
What are you doing here?

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.053
- Surprise.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:19:59.925
- Hello sir.

01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:02.754
Hello, hi, you want cola?

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:03.799
I will make.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.466
- [Dave] Looks like
a storage unit.

01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:21.468
- [Todd] You get
what you pay for.

01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:24.820
- What's with the music?
- Probably a wedding.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:27.474
Dave, why are you here?

01:20:27.518 --> 01:20:28.954
- What kind of manager would
I be if I didn't drop in

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:30.477
on the field operations
every now and then?

01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:31.478
- You don't trust me?

01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:33.089
- Of course I trust you.

01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:35.787
I just want to see
it with my own eyes.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.007
All I'm gettin' is a bunch
of numbers, which look good.

01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:41.053
Some might say too good
for three weeks' work.

01:20:41.097 --> 01:20:42.707
- You think I'm rigging the MPI?

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.969
- [Dave] Relax.

01:20:44.013 --> 01:20:45.362
If I walk in and
see two dozen people

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:48.974
generating an MPI in the
sixes, I will be a happy man.

01:20:49.018 --> 01:20:49.975
- [Todd] After you.

01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:53.936
[water splashing]

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:58.157
[speaking in foreign language]

01:20:58.201 --> 01:21:01.204
Puro, what the hell is this?

01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:03.293
- It's the water coming
from the farmer next door

01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:04.642
because of the irrigation.

01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:05.904
- Irrigation?

01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:08.167
- That's when water is
planted on the crops.

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.126
- I know what that means.

01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:12.563
- [Puro] Water is
coming from everywhere.

01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:13.520
Nowhere to go.

01:21:13.564 --> 01:21:15.000
A big problem, what to do?

01:21:15.044 --> 01:21:17.568
We're down to 10
working stations.

01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:21.354
[electricity crackling]

01:21:21.398 --> 01:21:22.921
Now eight, oh my god.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.924
- I am going to
shred your passport.

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.884
- Relax, Dave, it's no problem.

01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:31.364
- [Dave] No problem?

01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:33.018
How can you say no problem?

01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:35.020
What would a problem
look like, Todd?

01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:36.413
- It's no problem.

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:37.675
We're goin' up to the roof.

01:21:37.718 --> 01:21:38.545
- The roof?

01:21:39.764 --> 01:21:42.027
- People, we're
going up to the roof.

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:44.725
We're gonna rewire this whole
place in the next 20 minutes.

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:46.814
It's a nice night,
it's dry up there,

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:48.338
we'll bring up
the work stations,

01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:49.730
run a new main power cable.

01:21:49.774 --> 01:21:51.602
We're going back
online upstairs.

01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:54.126
- That's impossible.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.693
- Maybe back in
the states, it is.

01:21:55.736 --> 01:21:57.042
Anil, get the car.

01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:00.524
I'll be right back
with a consultant.

01:22:01.394 --> 01:22:02.134
- Consultant?

01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:04.049
[hectic music]

01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:07.923
[singing in foreign language]

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:24.069
- Puro, this is my neighbor.

01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:26.463
He's gonna help
with the rewiring.

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:27.768
- Okay.

01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:28.639
- He'll show you.

01:22:33.122 --> 01:22:34.210
- Consultant?

01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:36.429
- Yeah.

01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:51.053
[Todd whistling]

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.451
[electricity crackling]

01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:01.150
[Windows music]

01:23:05.154 --> 01:23:08.026
[all applauding]

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.984
See?

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.115
No problem.

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:14.511
- [Manmeet] Oh
yes, I am sincere.

01:23:14.554 --> 01:23:16.121
Look, I do not care
what you look like.

01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:19.211
You have such a lovely
voice and personality.

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:22.519
- Manmeet, marriage
proposal is not small talk.

01:23:23.781 --> 01:23:25.174
- I think she's the one.

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.044
- Not tonight.

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:28.046
- But Todd, I'm in love.

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.223
- As long as she buys
something every five minutes

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:33.008
and you clock it as
a separate incident,

01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:34.226
you can say whatever you want.

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.532
- [Manmeet] Thanks, Todd.

01:23:36.663 --> 01:23:38.883
Elizabeth, wonderful news.

01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.711
We can speak all night,

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:42.017
I mean all day.

01:23:44.889 --> 01:23:46.195
- Yes, sir.

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:47.631
No, sir.

01:23:47.674 --> 01:23:48.414
Maybe, sir.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:52.070
Quick, quick, quick,
it's a supervisor demand.

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:55.726
- Hey Gaurav.

01:23:55.769 --> 01:23:56.553
Thanks.

01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.078
Hello.

01:24:00.122 --> 01:24:01.601
- [Man] You gotta be kidding me.

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:03.690
I'm buying a freaking
American eagle from a company

01:24:03.734 --> 01:24:06.041
that's supposed to be in
America and I get India?

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:07.694
- I understand that
you're upset, sir.

01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:08.478
- [Man] No, you don't.

01:24:08.521 --> 01:24:10.045
You don't understand.

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:11.437
Last month, I lost my job
at the plant where I worked

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:14.353
for 22 years because the whole
operation moved to Mexico.

01:24:14.397 --> 01:24:16.399
My brother had to leave town
because there are no jobs.

01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:17.791
- I know how you feel, sir.

01:24:17.835 --> 01:24:18.575
- [Man] No, you don't!

01:24:18.618 --> 01:24:19.750
You have a job.

01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:21.056
- Sir, please don't hang up.

01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:22.231
I have a solution for you.

01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:24.146
- What?
- See, we understand

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:26.713
that many Americans are
upset about outsourcing

01:24:26.757 --> 01:24:28.846
so we have located
American-made versions

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:30.630
of all our products.

01:24:30.674 --> 01:24:32.719
If you have a pen, I
will give you the website

01:24:32.763 --> 01:24:35.331
of an American company
that makes an eagle statue

01:24:35.374 --> 01:24:38.116
very similar to ours,
same size, same materials,

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.076
only theirs is made
100% in America.

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:42.947
- [Man] Well, thanks.

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:45.602
I appreciate it, but is
the price about the same?

01:24:45.645 --> 01:24:48.083
- No sir, theirs is $212 more.

01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:51.869
- [Man] 212.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.220
- Sir?

01:24:55.264 --> 01:24:57.353
- [Man] Yeah, all right,
just sell me yours.

01:24:57.396 --> 01:24:58.615
- Thank you, sir.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:24:59.311
May I have your
credit card number?

01:25:01.922 --> 01:25:04.186
[soft music]

01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:08.538
- All right, let me check
that with my supervisor.

01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.193
Okay, this can be shipped
overnight at no extra charge.

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:12.455
Anything else?

01:25:12.498 --> 01:25:14.065
Okay, thank you for
calling Western Novelty.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.979
My name is Gaurav.

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:23.248
- [Todd] That's the day.

01:25:23.292 --> 01:25:24.467
Well done, everyone.

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:25.642
Thank you.

01:25:25.685 --> 01:25:28.297
By the way, we broke six.

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.474
Congratulations.
[all applauding]

01:25:31.517 --> 01:25:33.476
You guys are amazing.

01:25:33.519 --> 01:25:35.130
I want to see you
all at the Lotus.

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.484
Dave?

01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.097
Hey, feelin' okay?

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.664
- Like I swallowed
a live squirrel.

01:25:47.707 --> 01:25:49.796
- Ah, don't worry,
it'll only last a week.

01:25:51.407 --> 01:25:52.277
Look, some of us are goin' over

01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:53.148
to the Lotus Club and celebrate.

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:54.627
Why don't you come with us?

01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:56.281
- What's the Lotus?

01:25:56.325 --> 01:25:57.804
- It's like an after hours
club for call center workers

01:25:57.848 --> 01:25:59.197
who get off at 6:00 a.m.

01:25:59.241 --> 01:26:00.764
Ya know what, it'll be
fun, you wouldn't like it.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:01.982
- I need to talk to you.

01:26:02.026 --> 01:26:03.462
- We can talk tomorrow.

01:26:03.506 --> 01:26:05.421
- No, you're right, there's
another reason I came here.

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.643
I need to wipe our proprietary
data off these hard drives

01:26:10.687 --> 01:26:12.167
before we pull out of India.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.345
- What are you talking about?

01:26:16.388 --> 01:26:17.563
Don't tell me a cheap
bastard like you

01:26:17.607 --> 01:26:19.043
is gonna move fulfillment
back to Seattle?

01:26:19.086 --> 01:26:19.913
- No.

01:26:19.957 --> 01:26:20.740
China.

01:26:22.394 --> 01:26:24.788
We're running an existing
call center there already.

01:26:24.831 --> 01:26:26.572
They go online tomorrow.

01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:27.704
China's the new India.

01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:30.315
20 heads for the price of one.

01:26:33.405 --> 01:26:38.367
What are ya gonna do?

01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:41.935
[water splashing]

01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:51.728
[rooster crowing]

01:26:55.819 --> 01:26:57.386
[bright music]

01:26:57.429 --> 01:27:01.128
[singing in foreign language]

01:27:05.002 --> 01:27:07.657
[all applauding]

01:27:10.312 --> 01:27:13.010
- Make a speech!
- Speech!

01:27:13.053 --> 01:27:14.620
- I do have something to say.

01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:18.363
Unfortunately, it's bad news.

01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:19.538
I just found out.

01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:24.195
I don't know an
easy way to do this.

01:27:25.762 --> 01:27:27.329
Uh, Western Novelty has decided

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:29.418
to move order
fulfillment to China.

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:34.423
All of your jobs
have been outsourced.

01:27:36.512 --> 01:27:38.253
Don't go to work
tomorrow, it's over.

01:27:39.732 --> 01:27:42.431
Mr. Dave is wiping the
hard drives right now.

01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:46.130
You get a month's severance pay.

01:27:46.173 --> 01:27:46.957
That's it.

01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:52.441
- That's not so bad.

01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:54.051
We can go somewhere.

01:27:54.094 --> 01:27:56.532
- Guys, announcement.

01:27:58.185 --> 01:27:58.969
I am,

01:28:00.579 --> 01:28:03.452
I am engaged to Elizabeth
Watson of Orange, New Jersey!

01:28:03.495 --> 01:28:06.193
[all cheering]

01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:18.728
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

01:28:18.771 --> 01:28:19.555
I swear.

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:23.602
Why are they happy about this?

01:28:23.646 --> 01:28:24.603
- They will be.

01:28:25.822 --> 01:28:26.605
It doesn't matter.

01:28:27.519 --> 01:28:28.955
We've trained them to a point

01:28:28.999 --> 01:28:31.349
where they can get
a job anywhere,

01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:33.743
Microsoft, Dell, Office Tiger.

01:28:34.961 --> 01:28:37.442
They will get a job in a week.

01:28:37.486 --> 01:28:41.359
And with severance pay,
they can have some fun.

01:28:41.403 --> 01:28:43.230
- So you can get
another job, too?

01:28:44.101 --> 01:28:45.494
- Management is different.

01:28:46.756 --> 01:28:47.887
I'm not young anymore.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.673
If I'm lucky, I'll get a job.

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:53.937
But that might take a long time.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.635
Bagshi's parents will hear this

01:28:56.679 --> 01:28:59.769
and she will marry someone else.

01:28:59.812 --> 01:29:01.118
- What's the hurry?

01:29:01.161 --> 01:29:02.598
- Astrology.

01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:04.339
Our moons are lined up.

01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:05.992
Auspicious time.

01:29:06.036 --> 01:29:08.081
She must marry this year.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.648
And now, I don't have a job.

01:29:09.692 --> 01:29:11.258
- I'm so sorry.

01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:14.479
- I must leave India.
- What?

01:29:14.523 --> 01:29:16.307
Why?

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.265
- I will die if I
see Bagshi walking

01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:20.050
on the street with
her new husband.

01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:25.795
- If it's any consolation,
I'm probably fired, too.

01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:31.191
- I'm sorry.

01:29:32.671 --> 01:29:33.759
You're a good boss.

01:29:35.718 --> 01:29:37.110
- Asha.

01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:38.460
Sorry.

01:29:38.503 --> 01:29:40.505
- Oh, listen, I'm not
concerned about the job.

01:29:40.549 --> 01:29:42.377
I'm more concerned
about my novel.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:45.554
- Your what?

01:29:45.597 --> 01:29:47.991
- I'm writing a book in
between calls at work,

01:29:48.034 --> 01:29:49.906
and I saved a copy
on my hard drive.

01:29:49.949 --> 01:29:51.516
I don't want Dave to erase it.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.432
So can we go back and save it?

01:29:54.476 --> 01:29:56.042
- Yeah, I guess we should.

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:57.392
- [Asha] I think we should go.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.437
Immediately.

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:03.615
- What's this book
of yours called?

01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:08.315
- Holiday in Goa.
[soft music]

01:30:16.759 --> 01:30:18.238
- That was great, I almost
believed you myself.

01:30:18.282 --> 01:30:19.675
Maybe you should--
- Todd,

01:30:19.718 --> 01:30:20.850
no time for small talk.

01:30:20.893 --> 01:30:22.460
- Where can we go?

01:30:22.504 --> 01:30:25.376
- Gaurav gave us the
key to his place.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.857
It's okay, he's a
friend, I can trust him.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.598
We can be alone together.

01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:30.555
We have two hours.

01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:36.082
[singing in foreign language]

01:30:50.314 --> 01:30:51.968
- Okay, I have to
ask you something.

01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:55.232
What is that?

01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:58.583
- [laughing] It's a bindi.

01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:00.324
It's your third eye.

01:31:00.367 --> 01:31:03.632
It's the eye with which you
see the most important things.

01:31:05.068 --> 01:31:07.984
Sometimes, two eyes aren't
enough and they need help.

01:31:10.943 --> 01:31:12.815
But you have already
been my third eye.

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:15.557
- I have?

01:31:16.558 --> 01:31:17.341
How?

01:31:18.603 --> 01:31:20.736
- Well, my father is
an assistant manager

01:31:20.779 --> 01:31:24.348
in a phone company and my mother
comes from a small village.

01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:25.958
A girl in my position
has her whole life

01:31:26.002 --> 01:31:28.308
mapped out in front of her.

01:31:28.352 --> 01:31:30.572
Everything I've done,
I've had to fight for.

01:31:30.615 --> 01:31:31.921
Asha, you can't
go to university.

01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.705
Asha, you can't work
in a call center.

01:31:33.749 --> 01:31:34.619
What would people say?

01:31:36.447 --> 01:31:37.230
What you said,

01:31:38.797 --> 01:31:41.800
it was the first time I'd
ever heard anything like that.

01:31:46.022 --> 01:31:46.762
- What did I say?

01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:50.679
- Asha can do anything.

01:32:01.385 --> 01:32:02.560
I always wanted to believe that,

01:32:02.604 --> 01:32:04.736
but until you, I didn't
think it was true.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.262
- I hope Ashauk sees it.

01:32:10.786 --> 01:32:12.657
- Well, he'd better,
because if he doesn't,

01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:14.659
then I'll leave him and
I'll come to the U.S.

01:32:14.703 --> 01:32:15.878
and take away your job.

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:21.797
- [Todd] I'm gonna miss you.

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:26.236
- You'll meet someone.

01:32:26.279 --> 01:32:28.717
- [Todd] If I do, she
won't smell like cardamom.

01:32:34.636 --> 01:32:36.463
- Rub some on her
and pretend she's me.

01:32:37.639 --> 01:32:39.728
- [Todd] She won't
have your eyes, either.

01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:44.297
I wish I could meet
someone exactly like you.

01:32:45.951 --> 01:32:46.996
Well, almost exactly.

01:32:51.261 --> 01:32:52.131
- Almost?

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:57.093
- Someone as beautiful
as you and smart as you,

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.026
This hardware's not
worth shipping to China,

01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.940

leave it here.

You don't need me anymore.

gotta train the new guy.

going to outsource

I showed them your
numbers, and they want you.

01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:41.153
It's no joke, it's a great job.

All right.

We'll beat their
offer, whatever it is.

01:35:11.009 --> 01:35:13.795
Did I mention your stock
options will double in value?

01:35:13.838 --> 01:35:14.926
Maybe triple?

01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:17.755
And you don't have
to live in China.

01:35:17.799 --> 01:35:19.888
No, all you have to do is get
the call center up to speed.

01:35:19.931 --> 01:35:21.324
Then you visit every
couple of months.

01:35:21.367 --> 01:35:23.239
You get first-class travel
and a corporate apartment

- [Todd] - It's an expression,
it basically means good luck.

I hope that both
your legs get broken.

you said that.
