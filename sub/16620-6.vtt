00:19.427 --> 00:21.362
You guys are into
rosemary, right?

00:21.363 --> 00:22.763
The lady who had the baby?

00:22.764 --> 00:24.030
No, the herb.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.499
I'm looking for recipes
for Thanksgiving next week.

00:26.534 --> 00:29.737
Uh-oh, somebody's getting
excited about Thanksgiving.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.005
Mm, maybe.

00:31.006 --> 00:32.539
He's freaking out.
Look at him.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.108
Yeah, he's pulling
his hair out.

00:34.109 --> 00:36.210
Oh, wait, no.
That was like that.

00:36.211 --> 00:37.845
Hmm. Bald joke.
Yeah.

00:37.846 --> 00:39.246
What you doing, Tina?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.848
You didn't finish
your homework last night?

00:40.849 --> 00:42.348
Oh, this isn't
homework.

00:42.384 --> 00:44.217
I'm working on
some erotic holiday fiction.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.719
Hmm. Oh, like the one you wrote

00:45.720 --> 00:47.388
where St. Patrick
got his groove back?

00:47.389 --> 00:48.789
Oh, y-you read that?
Yeah.

00:48.790 --> 00:49.957
I loved that one.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.024
Wait, you read it, too?

00:51.059 --> 00:52.258
I mean, I heard about it.

00:52.294 --> 00:54.061
When I-I was reading it
out loud.

00:54.062 --> 00:56.363
I overheard <i> some</i> of it.
I heard it, too.

00:56.364 --> 00:57.897
What's this one
about, Tina?

00:57.932 --> 00:59.300
Well, this one's
for Thanksgiving,

00:59.301 --> 01:00.768
and it's called
"The Quirky Turkey."

01:00.769 --> 01:02.202
It's about a turkey
who wears glasses.

01:02.203 --> 01:03.871
Also, she has skinny legs

01:03.872 --> 01:05.973
that she may or may not hide
with knee-high socks.

01:05.974 --> 01:07.875
And she feels left out
because she doesn't look

01:07.876 --> 01:08.876
like all the other turkeys.

01:08.877 --> 01:10.677
Is that... about... you?

01:10.712 --> 01:13.314
(nervous chuckle):
No. No. What?

01:13.315 --> 01:15.082
All right, fine,
it might have been inspired

01:15.083 --> 01:16.317
by a real-life event where

01:16.318 --> 01:18.184
a certain word was
thrown around.

01:18.219 --> 01:19.653
Hi, guys.
(chuckles)

01:19.654 --> 01:22.188
Tina, you're so quirky.

01:22.223 --> 01:24.424
She's right, you are.
You are.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.225
You are.
Oh, my God, you really are.

01:26.261 --> 01:27.995
Oh, my God, she's,
like, so quirky.

01:27.996 --> 01:30.130
Wait, is quirky
a good thing?

01:30.131 --> 01:32.733
(laughs) That's such
a quirky thing to ask.

01:32.734 --> 01:35.002
So, yeah, I'm taking
back the "Q" bomb

01:35.003 --> 01:36.670
and mixing in a fun
holiday message.

01:36.671 --> 01:38.172
Well, that doesn't sound
very erotic.

01:38.173 --> 01:39.740
Which is totally fine.

01:39.741 --> 01:41.809
No, some stuff happens
with a pig. Oh.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.944
Some suggestive situations,
implied nudity.

01:43.945 --> 01:45.312
Oh, okay, I got it.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.446
So how's it end?

01:46.481 --> 01:48.015
The not-quirky turkeys realize

01:48.016 --> 01:50.284
that they aren't there
for dinner, they <i> are</i> dinner.

01:50.285 --> 01:52.251
And they get their heads
chopped off on Thanksgiving.

01:52.287 --> 01:54.154
Aw, that's nice.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.156
So, you excited?

01:56.157 --> 01:57.858
My little turkeys
get a long weekend.

01:57.859 --> 02:00.593
(sighs) I'm looking forward
to Thanksgiving,

02:00.628 --> 02:03.330
but I am not looking forward
to the day before Thanksgiving.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.133
We have to sit through one of
Mr. Frond's stupid plays again.

02:06.134 --> 02:08.101
I'm still bored
from last year's play.

02:08.136 --> 02:10.371
(flatly):
♪ We're thankful for ♪

02:10.372 --> 02:13.040
♪ These foods we're eating ♪

02:13.041 --> 02:16.844

we're eating ♪

02:16.845 --> 02:18.846
♪ A, apples ♪

02:18.847 --> 02:20.813
♪ A, apple pie... ♪

02:20.849 --> 02:22.483
Yeah, Mr. Frond's
plays aren't great,

02:22.484 --> 02:24.051
but isn't going
to a play better

02:24.052 --> 02:25.552
than going to
actual school?

02:25.553 --> 02:27.621
I mean, do you
guys like school?

02:27.622 --> 02:28.688
I've never
asked you that.

02:28.723 --> 02:29.990
That's the thing!

02:29.991 --> 02:32.659
The day before Thanksgiving
is supposed to be a half day.

02:32.660 --> 02:34.294
It's on
the school schedule.

02:34.295 --> 02:35.662
And in most Bibles.

02:35.663 --> 02:37.296
At least in the
Ving Rhames version.

02:37.332 --> 02:39.466
(chuckles)
King James, Gene.

02:39.467 --> 02:40.633
Ving Rhames!

02:42.137 --> 02:43.803
(microphone feedback hums)

02:43.838 --> 02:45.139
Lunch announcements.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.708
First up,
from the Women's Issues club,

02:47.709 --> 02:49.843
we have Peter and Zeke.

02:49.844 --> 02:51.310
What's up, ladies!

02:51.346 --> 02:53.080
Our main issue right now
is that

02:53.081 --> 02:55.015
no girls signed up
for this club.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.384
And Peter and I wrote a song
about it. Hit it!

02:57.385 --> 03:00.053
♪ I don't have a vagina ♪

03:00.054 --> 03:02.055
♪ But I won't stop try'na ♪

03:02.056 --> 03:03.524
Come on, girls!
♪ Help women with their issues ♪

03:03.525 --> 03:04.725
Okay, okay, okay.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.993
Come on, girls,
sign up right now!

03:05.994 --> 03:08.262
Okay, okay,
shutting it down.

03:08.263 --> 03:09.829
Shutting it down.

03:09.864 --> 03:12.199
Holy moly, that's it!

03:12.200 --> 03:14.401
What's it?
That's how we get our half day.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.903
Join the Women's
Issues club?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.872
No. What if the day-before-
Thanksgiving play is

03:18.873 --> 03:22.009
so offensive that
it gets shut down?

03:22.010 --> 03:23.677
We'd all go home early.

03:23.678 --> 03:26.180
Why would it be offensive?
It's never offensive.

03:26.181 --> 03:28.916
It's just bad and boring,
like avocado toast.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.750
But what if we could
convince Mr. Frond

03:30.785 --> 03:32.553
to let us do the play,

03:32.554 --> 03:35.289
and then we make it so
horrible and inappropriate

03:35.290 --> 03:36.757
that he shuts it down?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.393
Boom, half day.
A <i> real</i> half day!

03:39.394 --> 03:40.961
But where are we
gonna find a play

03:40.962 --> 03:42.463
that's inappropriate,
offensive

03:42.464 --> 03:43.930
and Thanksgiving-themed?

03:43.965 --> 03:45.365
What's the most
erotic temperature

03:45.366 --> 03:46.532
you could cook a turkey at?

03:46.568 --> 03:48.969
375.
Thanks.

03:48.970 --> 03:50.304
Oh, my God, Tina,

03:50.305 --> 03:53.039
did you, uh, hear anything
we were just talking about?

03:53.074 --> 03:54.308
No.
Great.

03:54.309 --> 03:55.442
How's your
Thanksgiving play going?

03:55.443 --> 03:56.577
Oh, it's not a play.

03:56.578 --> 03:57.743
It is now.

03:59.214 --> 04:01.949
♪ Peelin' the potatoes,
tryin' not to fart... ♪

04:01.950 --> 04:03.484
Thank you, Linda.

04:03.485 --> 04:05.719
♪ I'll just let out
a little one ♪

04:05.720 --> 04:07.321
♪ It's my
little secret. ♪

04:07.322 --> 04:08.454
Oh, my God.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.057
(gasps) Oh, my gosh!

04:10.058 --> 04:11.792
I know. I have to live with you.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.726
No, look at this potato.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.496
Yeah?
It looks like a face.

04:15.497 --> 04:16.829
Oh, okay.
(gasps)

04:16.831 --> 04:19.132
It looks exactly
like my grandfather.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.267
Like, exactly.
It does?

04:21.269 --> 04:23.504
Yeah, my mother's
father, Burt.

04:23.505 --> 04:25.204
This is his
spitting image, look.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.242
I mean, don't all old men
kind of look like potatoes?

04:28.243 --> 04:31.245
It's even got the bumpy thing
on its face in the same spot.

04:31.246 --> 04:33.180
He used to put a nickel
on the top of it,

04:33.181 --> 04:34.380
and then I'd
snatch it off.

04:34.415 --> 04:35.782
Hmm, great.

04:35.783 --> 04:37.251
All right,
let's make fries.

04:37.252 --> 04:39.119
No! Not with Grandpa.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.188
Right.
That'd be crazy.

04:41.189 --> 04:43.457
You know what? I'm gonna
keep him for a little while.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.859
It'll be good for the kids
to get to know my grandpa.

04:45.860 --> 04:48.195
Potato.
Grandpa Potato!

04:48.196 --> 04:49.997
Yeah, Grandpa Potato.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.064
I wasn't trying to name...
Forget it.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.501
MR. FROND:
<i>So you want to put on</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:55.835
<i>the Thanksgiving play
this year?</i>

04:55.870 --> 04:57.004
What can we say?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.272
I mean, you inspire us,
Mr. Frond.

04:59.307 --> 05:01.775
And I should probably
just continue to do that.

05:01.776 --> 05:03.677
This year,
everyone will be reading

05:03.678 --> 05:07.480
from an 88-stanza epic poem
called "The Pilgrims' Picnic."

05:07.515 --> 05:09.316
Oh, it sounds great,
Mr. Frond.

05:09.317 --> 05:10.683
Everyone likes stanzas.

05:10.718 --> 05:12.185
I mean, they kind of do.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.753
Right? Right?

05:13.788 --> 05:15.222
You seem pretty confident.

05:15.223 --> 05:17.391
After all, it's just
your reputation... no biggie.

05:17.392 --> 05:19.926
Sounds like you don't need
our play,

05:19.961 --> 05:21.194
so see ya later.
Uh...

05:21.195 --> 05:25.131
W-Well, just out of curiosity,
what is your play?

05:25.166 --> 05:26.567
It's called <i> The Quirky Turkey.</i>

05:26.568 --> 05:28.534
It's based on an original
short story by me.

05:28.570 --> 05:29.969
Oh. Is it erotic?

05:30.004 --> 05:31.405
Suggestive situations.

05:31.406 --> 05:33.307
I'm cutting back
on the implied nudity.

05:33.308 --> 05:35.174
Okay, not a good start.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.178
Picture this: an underdog story
about a turkey.

05:38.179 --> 05:40.247
An under-turkey.
Who wears glasses.

05:40.248 --> 05:43.182
It's a metaphor for self-esteem
and community.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.850
Ooh, I like that.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.253
Yeah, we knew
you would.

05:46.254 --> 05:47.821
What about music?
My plays always have music.

05:47.822 --> 05:49.522
Makes the whole thing
more musical.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.359
And that's why
we brought Gene on

05:52.360 --> 05:53.760
as our musical director.

05:53.761 --> 05:54.861
You did?

05:54.862 --> 05:57.731
Oh. Yes, now I remember.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.332
You absolutely did.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.534
Mm, I'm still not
entirely convinced.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.070
That's because you have
high standards,

06:03.071 --> 06:04.537
and we love that.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.241
And that's why we need you
to be our executive producer.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.545
Oh. What does
an executive producer do?

06:11.546 --> 06:14.080
Basically you accept awards
and give interviews.

06:14.115 --> 06:16.515
I-I can do that.
I-I'd be great at that.

06:16.551 --> 06:18.118
Yeah, you just say things like,

06:18.119 --> 06:20.419
"They said it would never work,
but look at us now."

06:20.455 --> 06:22.055
Oh, that's good.

06:22.056 --> 06:24.890
What if I said, "This is a real
passion project for me"?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.126
Perfect.
Nice.

06:26.127 --> 06:27.361
Super cool.

06:27.362 --> 06:30.496
So, uh, Mr. Frond,
what do you say?

06:30.531 --> 06:33.300
Belcher children,
you have my permission

06:33.301 --> 06:35.135
to put on
<i>The Quirky Turkey.</i>

06:35.136 --> 06:36.370
ALL:
Yeah!

06:36.371 --> 06:38.393
Let's get to quirk!

06:39.747 --> 06:42.472
Welcome to the open casting call
for the first ever

06:42.473 --> 06:44.340
student-produced
Thanksgiving play,

06:44.341 --> 06:45.909
<i>The Quirky Turkey!</i>

06:45.910 --> 06:48.111
This is your moment
and your stage.

06:48.112 --> 06:49.412
And also your
lunchtime,

06:49.413 --> 06:50.980
so remember to
eat afterwards...

06:50.981 --> 06:52.949
or during your auditions,
like I will be doing.

06:52.950 --> 06:54.650
We're looking for
the best of the best.

06:54.685 --> 06:56.419
(quietly):
Or the best at being worst.

06:56.420 --> 06:57.954
Mm-hmm.

06:57.955 --> 06:59.789
I can almost do the splits.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.157
Almost. Ow.

07:01.158 --> 07:03.225
Not quite. Ow. Ow!

07:03.260 --> 07:05.295
Love it! Welcome aboard.

07:05.296 --> 07:06.696
Look at this, look at that.

07:06.697 --> 07:07.764
Look at this,
look at this.

07:07.765 --> 07:09.499
Look at that.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.333
Look at this, look at that,
look at this, look at this.

07:11.368 --> 07:12.401
Okay, you got the part.

07:12.436 --> 07:13.436
Thank you!
LOUISE: Yup.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.271
You were really good.
Thank you, I know.

07:15.272 --> 07:18.307
The lights are too bright!
Can you turn them down?

07:18.342 --> 07:21.210
Your future's even brighter,
'cause you're in the show!

07:21.211 --> 07:23.479
I just came in here to see
what everybody was doing.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.247
Now I'm on stage.
What's going on?

07:25.282 --> 07:27.349
You got the part!
That's what's going on.

07:27.384 --> 07:28.551
Do what?

07:28.552 --> 07:30.186
♪ Ave ♪

07:30.187 --> 07:34.489
♪ Maria. ♪

07:34.525 --> 07:37.160
Thank you. We'll let you know.
Next!

07:37.161 --> 07:38.895
Wait, Louise,
what are you doing?

07:38.896 --> 07:40.997
She's really good.
Maybe she could play the lead.

07:40.998 --> 07:43.199
Nah, nah, nah. She's not really
what we're looking for.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.368
Plus, we already know who's
playing the Quirky Turkey.

07:45.369 --> 07:47.203
It's you.
What? Really?

07:47.204 --> 07:49.906
You're perfect, Tina. And you
know every word by heart.

07:49.907 --> 07:52.341
And you've captured
its dead-eyed stare.

07:52.376 --> 07:53.643
But I'm the writer, too.

07:53.644 --> 07:55.277
And I haven't even
finished the second act.

07:55.312 --> 07:56.412
Oh, we won't get that far.

07:56.413 --> 07:57.413
What?
Nothing, nothing.

07:57.414 --> 07:58.548
You're doing great.

07:58.549 --> 07:59.916
Gene, how's the music coming?

07:59.917 --> 08:02.117
Psh. Man. So good.

08:02.152 --> 08:03.519
TEDDY:
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

08:03.520 --> 08:04.553
Looks just like him.

08:04.588 --> 08:05.588
Same cheekbones.

08:05.589 --> 08:06.823
Same steely look.

08:06.824 --> 08:08.758
You see, Bob?
Teddy sees it, too.

08:08.759 --> 08:09.926
It's spooky.

08:09.927 --> 08:11.361
But also comforting.

08:11.362 --> 08:12.996
I miss Grandpa.

08:12.997 --> 08:14.998
Aw, he never got
to meet the kids.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.265
'Cause he died.

08:16.266 --> 08:18.001
Maybe I should make him
a little blanket.

08:18.002 --> 08:20.703
Oh, and a little cup of Jell-O.
He loved Jell-O.

08:20.704 --> 08:23.472
Hey, you could make him a little
plate of mashed potatoes, too.

08:23.507 --> 08:24.473
What are you talking about?

08:24.508 --> 08:26.342
Uh, it-it was a joke.

08:26.343 --> 08:28.877
Like, you know,
old people and...

08:28.912 --> 08:31.447
mashed potatoes, 'cause
they eat mashed potatoes,

08:31.448 --> 08:33.749
and he's a potato.
It's poor taste, Bob.

08:33.784 --> 08:34.851
Yeah, too soon.

08:34.852 --> 08:36.352
I'm gonna go
into the kitchen.

08:36.352 --> 08:38.453
Teddy, keep an eye on
Grandpa Potato today.

08:38.455 --> 08:40.089
Don't let Bob
fry him up.

08:40.090 --> 08:41.791
I'm not gonna fry up
your grandfather.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.292
You threw away
that piece of toast

08:43.293 --> 08:45.028
that looked like
it said "Wow."

08:45.029 --> 08:46.428
That was a dark day.

08:46.463 --> 08:48.163
LOUISE:
<i>All right, folks!</i>

08:48.198 --> 08:49.865
Just a few days
till curtains up.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.068
Let's give them
a show to remember.

08:52.069 --> 08:54.270
Hey, T. How's my
writer-slash-it-girl doing?

08:54.271 --> 08:55.938
I don't know.
I'm not feeling good

08:55.939 --> 08:57.573
about the second act, but...
All right, fantastic.

08:57.574 --> 08:58.840
I can't wait.
Um, okay.

08:58.876 --> 09:00.543
One more time
from the top, Zeke.

09:00.544 --> 09:02.045
Five, six, seven, eight!

09:02.046 --> 09:03.379
(Jimmy Jr. and Zeke grunting)

09:03.380 --> 09:06.315
I wish... I wish I could be
as graceful as you, J-Ju.

09:06.316 --> 09:08.151
But I can't. Too stiff!

09:08.152 --> 09:11.386
(grunts) Oh, God, I'm
going down! Going down!

09:11.422 --> 09:13.088
How are those harmonies coming,
ladies?

09:13.123 --> 09:14.523

09:18.128 --> 09:19.462

No.

09:19.463 --> 09:21.097
Jocelyn, that's not a harmony.
What?

09:21.098 --> 09:22.331
It's not?
No!

09:22.332 --> 09:24.067
Do you even know
what a harmony is?

09:24.068 --> 09:26.569
A harmony is when
I sing louder than you.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.337
No!
Oh.

09:28.338 --> 09:29.439
I'm dizzy.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.605
Keep up the good work.

09:30.641 --> 09:31.641
So, how's this?

09:31.642 --> 09:32.742
(plays riff)
Good?

09:32.743 --> 09:33.743
I mean, bad?

09:33.744 --> 09:35.144
Bad-good? Good-bad?

09:35.145 --> 09:36.612
I don't know.
I mean, it's bad.

09:36.613 --> 09:38.413
I mean, all of
it's bad, but is it

09:38.449 --> 09:40.516
"shut down" bad?
Is it "get a half day" bad?

09:40.517 --> 09:42.285
I guess something
just happens when you get

09:42.286 --> 09:43.885
in front of the hot lights.

09:43.921 --> 09:45.922
It makes you want to leave
your blood, sweat, tears

09:45.923 --> 09:47.489
and pee out on the stage.

09:47.524 --> 09:50.492
Oh, Gene. My Genie Gene!

09:50.527 --> 09:52.828
You and your words and
your stupid, stupid face.

09:52.863 --> 09:55.798

that we get this play shut down!

10:19.289 --> 10:21.524
of the Thanksgiving play,
which premieres tomorrow.

10:21.525 --> 10:23.626
Which I'm in.
As an actor.

10:23.627 --> 10:25.161
And I am, too, also.

10:25.162 --> 10:27.463
Yes.
I am the executive producer.

10:27.464 --> 10:29.332
This was
a real passion project for...

10:29.333 --> 10:31.701
Have you ever met
the people from <i> Bones?</i>

10:31.702 --> 10:33.136
Um, no...
Do you have a limousine?

10:33.137 --> 10:34.303
No. I drive a hatchback.

10:34.304 --> 10:35.538
Gross.
Do...

10:35.539 --> 10:37.173
Do you guys want to talk
about the play?

10:37.174 --> 10:39.142
What play?
Did you have plastic surgery?

10:39.143 --> 10:40.476
Be real.
No.

10:40.477 --> 10:42.211
Do you want
plastic surgery?

10:42.212 --> 10:43.746
No. What? What?

10:43.747 --> 10:45.548
If I were you,
here's where I'd start.

10:45.549 --> 10:47.016
Face. Back.
What?

10:47.017 --> 10:49.317
Front. Breath. (screams)

10:49.353 --> 10:51.521
Okay, we're all set
for tomorrow.

10:51.522 --> 10:54.423
Our sweet, sweet half day
is so close, I can taste it.

10:54.424 --> 10:56.092
It tastes like
victory, and nachos.

10:56.093 --> 10:57.492
So, what's the
plan again?

10:57.528 --> 10:59.695
Ugh, Gene! It all happens
after the first song

10:59.696 --> 11:01.530
when the turkeys get killed.

11:01.565 --> 11:04.167
<i>Backstage, an air compressor
will be attached to hoses,</i>

11:04.168 --> 11:06.202
<i>which will be attached to
bottles full of giblets</i>

11:06.203 --> 11:09.205
<i>and gizzards, which will be
inside the turkey heads.</i>

11:09.206 --> 11:12.542
<i>When I hit this button, the
turkey heads are gonna blow off</i>

11:12.543 --> 11:15.011
<i>and giblets and gizzards
are gonna go everywhere.</i>

11:15.012 --> 11:17.280
Like <i> Carrie</i> meets Gallagher
meets <i> Top Chef</i>

11:17.281 --> 11:18.647
meets <i> Double Dare!</i>

11:18.682 --> 11:20.449
Exactly. All right,
hands in the middle.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.185
"Get Frond to shut down
Tina's horrible play

11:22.186 --> 11:23.886
and get a half day"
on three!

11:23.887 --> 11:25.755
BOTH:
One, two, three...

11:25.756 --> 11:27.123
Get...
Get Frond to shut down...

11:27.124 --> 11:28.757
Louise! Gene! Oh!
Tina! (screams)

11:28.792 --> 11:30.058
H-How long have you been
standing there?

11:30.093 --> 11:31.059
Long enough!

11:31.094 --> 11:32.595
Why is my hand like this?

11:32.596 --> 11:34.363
We don't even do this
in our family.

11:34.364 --> 11:36.331
Do we play sports now, too?

11:36.366 --> 11:38.267
If the sport is lying
and ruining my play,

11:38.268 --> 11:41.404
yeah, I guess you do!
So, I <i> am</i> an athlete!

11:42.594 --> 11:44.343
So, this was
your plan all along?

11:44.344 --> 11:46.103
You're just using me
and my play?

11:46.138 --> 11:48.272
Tina, I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.075
Gene, when you said, "Tina,
your play's got the goods,"

11:50.076 --> 11:52.244
and you said "goods"
like it had a "Z" at the end,

11:52.245 --> 11:53.544
that was just a bunch of crap?

11:53.579 --> 11:55.647
I never should have put
that "Z" on the end.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.082
That's my biggest regret
in all of this "mezz."

11:58.117 --> 12:00.318
I came in here to tell
you guys that I finally,

12:00.319 --> 12:02.754
maybe, sort of finished the
big heartfelt musical number

12:02.755 --> 12:04.556
in act two, and now you're
saying that none of that

12:04.557 --> 12:06.324
even matters?
Hey.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.431
Save the drama for the stage,
Tina C. Williams!

12:08.461 --> 12:10.428
Yeah, don't get your pubes
in a tube.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.830
I <i> will</i> get my
pubes in a tube.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.632
We should all get
our pubes in a tube.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.600
'Cause Louise and Gene are
gonna ruin the whole play

12:15.601 --> 12:17.502
by dumping gizzards
and giblets all over the stage

12:17.503 --> 12:19.437
so Mr. Frond will
shut down the play!

12:19.438 --> 12:21.071
(all gasp, murmur)

12:21.107 --> 12:23.108
Okay, okay, just calm down.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.511
There is a completely reasonable
explanation for all of this.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.280
Yeah. You don't care
about the play.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.482
All you care about
is if the play gets shut down

12:30.483 --> 12:31.917
and we get a half day!

12:31.918 --> 12:32.918
ALL:
Oh.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.285
A half day?
I'd be into that.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.387
I'm as angry as you are!
Wait, what?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.590
Yeah, a half day
doesn't sound half bad.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.792
Hell yeah! I wouldn't mind
getting home early, too.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.628
And I want to go to the mall
that day to get leggings.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.764
Yeah, for her legs.
Yes.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.766
Well, Tina, looks like
everyone wants to go

12:47.767 --> 12:49.968
to Shutdown Town except for you.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.670
But we've all
worked so hard.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.470
Have we?
And I've worked hard

12:53.506 --> 12:55.340
getting a whole bunch
of giblets and gizzards.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.642
People don't want to sell
that stuff to a nine-year-old.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.344
Look, it'll all be
worth it tomorrow

12:59.345 --> 13:01.546
when you're sitting
on the couch, back in your PJs

13:01.547 --> 13:04.549
at 11:00 a.m., staring down
a four-day weekend.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.749
So, what do you say?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.651
You ready to tank
this turkey?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.187
Um, I guess.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.088
Yeah. If everyone else
wants to do it.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.691
All right,
so it's settled.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.225
The show must go off!

13:14.226 --> 13:15.559
See everyone tomorrow.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.476
What? No!

14:00.906 --> 14:02.674
Wait, make that waffles.
Scratch that.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.676
Make it pancake mix

I can't wait to see your
Thanksgiving play.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.888
Oh, it's gonna be
a real showstopper, Mom.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.190

Are you excited, Tina?

14:20.726 --> 14:22.127
Um, yeah, totally.

Of course she is!

Look at her, she can
barely contain herself.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.066
We're really proud
