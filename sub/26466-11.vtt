[Jefferson]<i> Previously</i>

00:03.520 --> 00:06.104
I inherited a briefcase

of goodies in it...

00:07.641 --> 00:09.541
[automated female voice]
<i> Access granted.</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:12.144
These are the pod kids.

00:12.146 --> 00:15.948
It's where they were giving
the original vaccinations
to the kids of Freeland.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.884
I can't pinpoint exactly where
they are, but they're here.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.953
Khalil is a danger to you
when he's with you.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.388
Because of Tobias?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.556
Yes, because of Tobias.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.658
He has to turn himself in
to the authorities.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.893
Your father's right.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.863
[Inspector Henderson on phone]
<i> Something went wrong</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:34.199
[Jefferson on phone]<i> Khalil?</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:36.201
There's no sign of him.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.202
[Tobias]<i> I wanted you</i>

If you can't walk

00:53.054 --> 00:54.586
Hang on, son.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.988
He's gonna keep you.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.206
[Reverend Holt] I have some
unfortunate news to share

01:14.208 --> 01:17.342
that I was contemplating
whether I should
share it or not

01:17.344 --> 01:20.679
because there's so much
going on in Freeland.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.883
Khalil Payne,
you remember him?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.752
He grew up right here
in the church.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.423
-He is currently
in the fight of his life.
-[congregation assenting]

01:31.425 --> 01:34.593
He's fighting for his life
right over here

01:35.796 --> 01:39.098
<i> Brother Khalil</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:43.335
<i> He needs your prayers,</i>
<i> but God willing,</i>

01:44.438 --> 01:45.804
<i> he will win the battle.</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:52.111
'Cause, you see,
Jesus will help him overcome.

01:52.546 --> 01:56.048
-[all cheering]
-Come on, somebody!
Won't he do it?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.619
All right. Yeah.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.322
[exhales]

02:06.327 --> 02:10.829
Brother Khalil is not the only
person currently in a battle.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.498
[congregation assenting]

02:13.734 --> 02:17.169
See, every second

02:17.738 --> 02:22.608
every man, woman and child
right here in Freeland

02:22.610 --> 02:26.078
are fighting for their lives
whether they
realize it or not.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.514
Freeland is under siege

02:28.516 --> 02:33.352
by enemy forces
seen and unseen,

[Reverend Holt]
<i> The One Hundred</i>

03:13.394 --> 03:14.560
[weakly] Mr. P?

03:16.230 --> 03:19.064
Wait... No.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.602
I need you to do
something for me.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.139
Yeah, okay. Anything.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.476
[coughing]

03:39.920 --> 03:42.387
Easy. Easy.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.337
I need Black Lightning
to kill Tobias.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.344
I can't do that.

04:05.879 --> 04:09.681
I... I'll give you
everything that you need...

04:11.719 --> 04:14.419
to take down his operations.

04:15.289 --> 04:20.959
I know his routes,
his... contacts, everything.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.966
I won't do that.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.771
We have to let
the judicial system
handle Tobias.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.041
The system?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.809
[breathing shakily]

04:38.412 --> 04:41.213
You mean the system
that let Tobias

04:41.215 --> 04:44.783
get away with shooting me
and Reverend Holt?

04:46.153 --> 04:51.657
The same system that let him
rip my spine out of my back?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.660
You mean the system

04:54.662 --> 04:59.031
that let him get away
with murdering your father?

05:02.970 --> 05:06.571
Mr. P, is that the system
that you're talking about?

05:10.577 --> 05:11.643
Huh?

05:14.181 --> 05:19.084
You promise me,
can you make him
suffer like me?

05:20.187 --> 05:21.253
Yes.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.592
I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you...

[Reverend Holt]
<i> Over hundreds of years</i>

<i> the one thing we have</i>
<i> learned as a people</i>

05:50.718 --> 05:54.219
<i> is that we cannot depend</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:02.060

I mean, it was
a brand new car.

out of the hospital

Crazy-ass scientist.

I haven't seen her
in 30 years.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.443
She looks exactly the same.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.081
She's supposed
to be in prison.

Looks like she tried
to do an experiment

They all lost their feet.
One died.

That's what she does.
You see that on her ankle?

12:44.131 --> 12:47.265
Yeah, it looks like an
electronic enclosure device.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.568
Gives you a little shock
if you try to break
a preset perimeter.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.838
Hmm. But why
is she back in Freeland
working on the pod kids?

Okay, now take control
of the power.

Yeah. I'm going to go
spend some time with Khalil.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.709
Okay.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.314
What did you tell her?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.651
What she needed to know.

14:58.999 --> 15:03.201
Dr. Conley. How are you?
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

-Yeah.

exposed to Green Light.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.880
Yes.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.683
So I have experience working
with enhanced individuals.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
I thought I might be
able to offer some help.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.287
Your work is primarily
experimental,

15:22.289 --> 15:24.355
so I wouldn't really be able
to entertain it

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
as a course of treatment
for Khalil.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.859
My work has gotten results.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.596
It's also caused
the deaths of several
of those enhanced people.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.767
Look, Lynn,
everything that can
be done is being done.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.203
The anesthesia
Khalil's body is producing

15:39.205 --> 15:42.040
has gone into overdrive
trying to deal
with his injuries,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.474
making it toxic.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.809
Well, my team could
bring in some treatments

15:44.811 --> 15:46.711
that we've developed
in our research.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.047
Like I said,
that's not going to happen.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.250
We can't allow experimental
procedures on our patients.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.919
Have you tried
removing the glands
that produce the toxins?

15:54.921 --> 15:57.322
You can use a different
class of anesthesia
in the operation.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.823
We've tried that.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.725
Well, can you
replace the implant?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.327
We wouldn't even know how.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.662
Whoever rebuilt his spine

16:04.664 --> 16:06.431
has technology
that no one I know of

16:06.433 --> 16:08.366
has in the United States
or elsewhere.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.691
Hey, Jeff. How you doing?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.327
I've been better.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.499
Look, I hate to
tell you this, but, uh...

16:41.868 --> 16:42.934
What?

16:42.936 --> 16:46.637
[sighs] Reverend Holt
had a heart attack
during his sermon

16:46.639 --> 16:48.506
in front of
his entire congregation.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.074
What?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.780
Wait, are you sure
it was a heart attack?

16:56.616 --> 16:59.817
Tobias has been trying
to get Reverend Holt
to sell the clinic,

16:59.819 --> 17:00.885
but he wouldn't do it,

17:00.887 --> 17:02.820
and Tobias is used to
getting what he wants.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.390
That's why I'm betting
he's behind the bombing
of the clinic.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.226
-Doesn't matter without proof.
-Yeah. [sighs]

17:09.662 --> 17:12.430
If we can't use Khalil's
testimony as evidence,

17:12.966 --> 17:16.567
maybe we can use it
as the information

17:16.569 --> 17:18.636
to help build a case
against Tobias.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.271
We may have something.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.441
Hey, Bill.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.747
I know where Tobias lives now.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.088
Okay, but I can't go in there
without a warrant.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.157
The last time
I arrested Tobias,

17:39.159 --> 17:40.992
he ended up having
a press conference

17:40.994 --> 17:42.827
on the steps
of my police station...

17:44.030 --> 17:45.930
and called me out
for false arrest.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.934
Look, in order
to catch Tobias,

17:50.703 --> 17:52.270
we have to work together.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.105
Isn't that what we're doing?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.043
What?

17:59.045 --> 18:00.178
I have...

18:02.849 --> 18:05.650
resources that can help you.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.420
What does that mean?

18:36.416 --> 18:37.515
Why are we here?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.885
Okay, look, Bill,
you my boy...

18:41.588 --> 18:43.654
and I should have told you
a long time ago

18:43.656 --> 18:45.623
who I really am,
that is on me.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.961
But I just wanna make sure
now that there's no more
secrets between us.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.698
I'm a cop, you're a vigilante.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.501
Are we good?

18:59.105 --> 19:00.471
We're good.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.240
Okay.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.312
[trilling]

19:11.584 --> 19:15.019
Oh, hell no. Really?

19:15.021 --> 19:16.854
Oh, Jesus.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.739
What the hell?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.444
You got any other
dead people around here?

19:40.446 --> 19:44.115
Lady Eve? Joey Toledo?
Jimmy Hoffa?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.018
No, just Gambi.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.721
Is this it, man?
Anything else?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.858
This is everything.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.164
Deputy Chief Henderson...

20:00.165 --> 20:01.798
I faked my death
because there were some
very serious people after me.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.302
And I needed
to smoke them out.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.904
I asked Jefferson
to keep my secret.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.073
Do you know
who tried to kill you?

20:09.075 --> 20:11.209
No, sir. Not yet.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.145
[takes deep breath]

20:14.147 --> 20:16.380
And I'm guessing
you're not really
a tailor, huh?

20:17.383 --> 20:21.252
No, I am a tailor...
That's just not all that I do.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.386
Well, bully for you.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.158
Y'all got all this
fancy tech down here

20:27.160 --> 20:28.759
and the only means
of communication

20:28.761 --> 20:31.162
you provide me with
is this cheap-ass phone?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.198
-We're old-school.
-[Inspector Henderson scoffs]

20:34.200 --> 20:36.100
It's more like cheap school.

20:37.103 --> 20:41.239
I, uh, had a tox screening
done on Reverend Holt's body.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.875
He was poisoned.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.010
But how did you even
get access to the body
to get a tox screen?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.945
It takes us weeks
to get results.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.014
I have people,
and we don't have weeks.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.783
Tobias is up to something
much bigger
than Reverend Holt.

20:52.785 --> 20:56.020
-He just did that for fun.
-Now we just need to prove it.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.923
We need to get him
on more than just one murder.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.625
Yeah, one murder
never sticks with Tobias.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.561
I mean, he always
finds a way to bribe
or intimidate the jury.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.762
Murder a witness.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.699
But if we can get him
for a whole
bunch of murders...

21:10.470 --> 21:12.436
A continuing
criminal enterprise.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.940
If we can get enough evidence
that Tobias is running one,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.475
we could turn it over
to the feds.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.944
They'll RICO him
and put him away forever.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.381
That is the plan.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.719
So... you in?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.864
What y'all got
to eat down here?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.538
[EKG beeping]

22:03.022 --> 22:04.655
[Khalil coughing]

22:35.221 --> 22:36.387
Baby?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.191
Are you okay?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.359
Mom, all people
are made up of millions
of electrical impulses.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.528
Okay.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.099
I can see those sparks.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.935
What do you mean?

22:52.238 --> 22:54.138
I mean,
I can see inside people.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.410
I didn't know
you could do that.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.645
Neither did I, but...

23:03.916 --> 23:04.982
Baby?

23:07.854 --> 23:13.057
On a healthy person,
those impulses pulsate
at a rapid and steady pace,

23:13.059 --> 23:15.259
but the electrical impulses
inside of Khalil

23:15.261 --> 23:18.129
are slowing
and they're getting dimmer.

23:20.533 --> 23:24.101
I can see him dying
and I can feel him dying.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.571
I'm sorry.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.411
But since those synapses
are electrical,

23:34.113 --> 23:36.914
I was thinking maybe I could
help them along.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.783
Help them along?

23:38.785 --> 23:41.519
Yeah,
I can control electricity.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.754
So maybe there's a way
that I could give his
synapses a jump-start.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.057
-You know, like a car?
-I don't think
that's a good idea.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.327
Khalil is not a car,
you can't jump-start him.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.700
What?

23:57.069 --> 23:58.135
Mom, the pods.

23:58.137 --> 24:02.807
We could put Khalil in a pod
in hibernation until we can...

24:02.809 --> 24:04.308
We can figure out
how to help him.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.043
Think about it.
Those vaccine kids,

24:06.045 --> 24:08.212
they've survived in pods
for over 30 years.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.980
We could do the same thing
with Khalil.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.783
He's enhanced,
he's not a meta-human.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.985
I couldn't survive
in one of those pods,

24:14.987 --> 24:17.154
and I'm not sure
he could, either.

24:17.156 --> 24:21.659
Maybe not, but we have to try.
Mom, we have to try.

24:23.396 --> 24:24.462
Please.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.397
[sighs]

24:26.766 --> 24:27.898
Thank you.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.835
Thank you.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.377
[door opens]

24:43.182 --> 24:44.248
Grace?

24:45.585 --> 24:46.650
Hey!

24:47.753 --> 24:48.819
He... Hey.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.355
What are you doing here?

24:53.526 --> 24:56.927
I know what it's like
to be waiting in the hospital
when someone's hurt,

24:56.929 --> 25:00.865
and I thought you
could use some greasy
hamburgers and fries.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.735
[Anissa] Mmm.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.604
-[sniffs] Mmm, my God!
They smell so good.
-It's the onions.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.939
And the grease.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.214
Look...

25:18.017 --> 25:20.684
I'm not going to tell you
that everything happens
for a reason,

25:21.153 --> 25:22.887
because I don't believe that.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.226
I came to tell you
that I care,

25:30.129 --> 25:33.197
and I'm sorry that
you and your family
are going through this.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.367
Thank you.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.079
All right,
let's bless this food,

25:49.081 --> 25:50.414
because I am starving.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.649
Yeah, it's all yours.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.486
[muffled grunting]

25:56.255 --> 25:58.656
I told you what would happen
if you came up short.

26:04.096 --> 26:08.332
You always knew I'd rule.
Knew before I did.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.068
But did you know
I'd have to deal
with such incompetence?

26:13.839 --> 26:18.108
Damn! They don't make these
shiftless Negroes
like they used to.

26:18.778 --> 26:22.346
A little bit of discipline
and they fall apart.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.283
[grunt]

26:28.788 --> 26:30.087
Take care of that for me.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.856
I don't dispose of bodies.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.959
Well, I'm expanding
your job description.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.128
Very good work on that thing
with the reverend.

26:38.631 --> 26:42.766
Poisoned handkerchief.
Hadn't heard that one before.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.369
Good work
on paying me on time.

26:50.443 --> 26:54.044
Look, I know
I never apologized.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.681
You're apologizing?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.384
I was wrong
to end it that way.

27:03.823 --> 27:07.291
It was a long time ago.
What's done is done.

27:07.893 --> 27:12.062
Besides,
what happened helped me
find my true calling.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.501
Good.
Now get rid of that body.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.918
Dr. Conley, I'm here to run
some tests on Khalil

27:34.920 --> 27:37.187
to determine
if he's a candidate
to be put in stasis

27:37.189 --> 27:39.256
until we can find a way
to figure out
if we can help him out.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.026
It's illegal for you
to run any tests

27:42.028 --> 27:44.595
or medical procedures
on a patient in our care.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.196
This is ASA
official business now.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.798
Also signed
by Khalil's mother,

27:47.800 --> 27:49.566
who's giving us authority
to help in his care.

27:50.336 --> 27:54.304
I'm sorry, we will not allow
an outside entity

27:54.306 --> 27:57.007
to perform work
on a patient in our hospital.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.444
If you prevent her son
from getting treatments
that might save his life,

28:00.446 --> 28:03.447
I'm sure she will
sue this hospital,
and I'm sure she'll win.

28:03.949 --> 28:06.050
Then I'm sure she will take
all of that money

28:06.052 --> 28:08.952
and sue you personally
into homelessness.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.739
[jazz music playing]

28:35.915 --> 28:40.317
Deputy Chief Henderson.
I'm always happy
to see a brother come up.

28:40.753 --> 28:44.988
Nice digs.
So this is your
secret hiding place?

28:44.990 --> 28:46.523
No secret, Deputy Chief.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.093
I'm just like
any other citizen of Freeland,

28:49.095 --> 28:50.394
except wealthier.

28:50.930 --> 28:54.732
To what do I owe
this unannounced,
no-warrant visit?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.867
Khalil Payne showed up
at St. Lewis Hospital

28:56.869 --> 28:59.336
-with his spine ripped out.
-I heard about that.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.573
What a shame.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.609
Khalil should have been
more careful
who he pissed off.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.978
Word on the street is
the person
he pissed off is you.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.182
It's true, I was angry.

29:12.184 --> 29:16.186
Angry's not the word.
Disappointed in Khalil.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.923
I had such compassion
for his situation,
a track star losing his legs.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.126
I mean, I tried to mentor him,

29:22.128 --> 29:25.362
but after I saw what he did
to those children at Garfield,

29:26.365 --> 29:27.798
I cut ties with him.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.300
I can't stand by lawlessness
and violence, Deputy Chief.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.869
I'm sure a man like you
can understand.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.238
When was the last time
you saw him, Tobias?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.539
[scoffs]

29:36.776 --> 29:38.308
It's been a while now.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.044
Last I heard,
Khalil tried to abscond

29:41.046 --> 29:43.247
with a bunch of stacks
from The One Hundred.

29:43.249 --> 29:46.817
My opinion? They probably were
making an example out of him.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.628
[on speakers]
<i> You like what you see?</i>

29:57.630 --> 30:00.164
I need you to scan as much
of the room as possible.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.332
Wonder how you can afford it.

30:02.935 --> 30:06.904
It's called good
old-fashioned hard work.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.473
Look, you can arrest me
if you want,

30:09.975 --> 30:12.009
but we both know
how that's going to end up.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.479
I'll lawyer up,
get released in a few hours,

30:15.481 --> 30:17.514
then hold another
press conference about you.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.982
[Gambi]<i> Go back</i>
<i> to the pool cues on the wall.</i>

30:18.984 --> 30:21.084
And the incompetent
Freeland PD.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.588
So you need to arrest me
or get out.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.424
-[Gambi] That's it.
-[Tobias]<i> 'Cause I have</i>
<i> somewhere to be.</i>

30:27.426 --> 30:29.893
-[system chimes]
-[Gambi] Got it.
That's a safe.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.134
I have the make and model.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.268
We have what we need,
Henderson.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.603
<i> You can get out of there.</i>

30:40.539 --> 30:42.105
I'll be seeing you again.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.708
[Tobias laughs]

30:44.710 --> 30:48.045
Aw, don't go away mad,
Deputy Chief.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.446
Just go away.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.448
[laughing]

31:09.001 --> 31:10.234
[beeps]

31:15.140 --> 31:16.573
[door opens]

31:20.746 --> 31:23.747
Hello, Dr. Jace. I'm Todd.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.417
-Who are you?
-I just told you, I'm Todd.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.720
You told me your name,
but who are you?

31:30.589 --> 31:34.558
I'm the person
getting you a one-night
"get out of jail free" card.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.227
I'm wearing an ankle device.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.663
I know.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.910
[device trilling]

32:01.921 --> 32:03.020
[Todd] That should do it.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.124
Please act
like you're reading.

32:12.464 --> 32:13.864
Stand up now, please.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.010
-You have got toys.
-[chuckles]

32:27.713 --> 32:28.779
That's right, mama.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.548
What do you want from me?

32:31.550 --> 32:34.017
Well, it's not really
about what I want.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.219
It's about what Tobias wants.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.058
-Tobias Whale?
-Do you know
of any other Tobiases?

32:53.672 --> 32:54.771
[Todd clears throat]

32:54.773 --> 32:56.373
[soft jazz music playing]

33:00.612 --> 33:01.678
[Tobias] Damn.

33:04.016 --> 33:08.018
I guess orange
is the new black.
Long time no see.

33:08.020 --> 33:11.621
-And yet we both
look the same.
-Indeed.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.257
You never thanked me
for creating
the anti-aging serum

33:14.259 --> 33:17.227
-that's kept us both so young.
-True that.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.196
Maybe that's because
when you gave me the serum,

33:19.198 --> 33:22.332
you didn't know if it would
keep me from aging or kill me.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.268
The day I thank
a crazy scientist

33:25.270 --> 33:28.772
for experimenting on my ass
is the day I die.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.442
Now, why don't you
elucidate me
on what you've been up to?

33:32.444 --> 33:34.778
Big picture and small.

33:36.348 --> 33:40.550
I was the architect
of the original
vaccine program in Freeland.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.953
When it ended,
I went to Markovia

33:42.955 --> 33:44.721
to create a meta program
for them.

33:45.958 --> 33:48.825
News reports of Freeland's
Green Light epidemic

33:48.827 --> 33:50.460
caught my eye,
and I came home.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.897
Except you came home
before that
and got your ass arrested

33:53.899 --> 33:56.566
for resuming
your same old tricks,

33:56.568 --> 33:59.036
illegal experiments on kids.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.806
Lie to me again and I'll rip
your tongue out
with fingernail clippers.

34:05.010 --> 34:08.412
The ASA helped me defect
a few years ago,

34:09.148 --> 34:13.050
hoping to cripple
Markovia's meta program,

34:13.585 --> 34:16.853
but I got in trouble,
as you've described.

34:16.855 --> 34:20.223
Recently, I've been
brought out in ASA custody

34:20.225 --> 34:21.925
to work with the pod kids.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.528
But you killed somebody else
and they threw you
back inside.

34:24.530 --> 34:28.498
-Multiple somebodies, yes.
-Aw, that's a shame.

34:29.334 --> 34:32.869
I have something that might be
of extreme value to you.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.105
I already know there's
meta-humans in the clinic.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.840
But no one but me
knows where they are.

34:38.010 --> 34:42.446
You get these metas
and you will have more power
than you ever imagined.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.250
You have no idea

34:47.252 --> 34:50.187
how much power
I've imagined having.

34:50.622 --> 34:53.190
Well, then this is just
what you're looking for.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.097
[indistinct chatter]

35:15.080 --> 35:16.646
[EKG beeping]

35:29.328 --> 35:30.494
[weakly] J...

35:34.933 --> 35:37.134
J, I'm dying.
[breathing shakily]

35:41.607 --> 35:43.073
I can feel it.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.347
It's okay. [breath trembling]

36:09.535 --> 36:10.600
[computer beeps]

36:15.340 --> 36:16.773
[Gambi]
The briefcase isn't there.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.742
[grunts]

36:21.513 --> 36:22.746
[sighs]

36:27.052 --> 36:30.120
Yeah... makes sense

36:31.623 --> 36:32.689
Makes sense.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.859
I mean, with Khalil
ready to turn
state's evidence.

36:35.861 --> 36:40.130
Then the visit by Henderson?
Tobias is not stupid.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.032
He knows he's being watched.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.535
We tried.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.471
[cell phone vibrating]

36:52.911 --> 36:54.945
Hey.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.980
Jefferson, you need
to come back to the hospital.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.482
I'll be right there.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.453
I gotta go.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.160
I'll be here.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.267
[Jennifer] Mom,
you have gotta get
Khalil into a pod fast.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.669
-He doesn't have
much time left.
-Baby...

37:19.671 --> 37:23.106
The toxins in Khalil's body
is stopping us
from putting him under.

37:23.108 --> 37:25.976
If we can't put him under,
we can't put him in a pod.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.678
I'm sorry.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.414
We can't save him.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.121
Jennifer, sweetheart...

37:39.958 --> 37:41.958
you should go and tell Khalil

37:41.960 --> 37:43.526
anything that you need
to tell him...

37:44.062 --> 37:45.195
[gasps]

37:45.797 --> 37:47.130
...while you still can.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.476
<i> ¶ I don't wanna</i>
<i> Write this down ¶</i>

37:59.478 --> 38:01.845
<i> ¶ I wanna tell you</i>
<i> How I feel right now ¶</i>

38:04.983 --> 38:07.550
-Wait a minute.
-What's wrong?

38:09.888 --> 38:13.223
-Where are we?
-We're at prom.

38:13.225 --> 38:17.227
No... seriously, where are we?

38:23.335 --> 38:24.701
J, am I dead?

38:25.504 --> 38:26.569
No.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.073
Not yet. Almost.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.712
But we're in my head,
in my safe space.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.417
How is that even possible?

38:41.620 --> 38:44.888
[sighs] I mean,
it's a long story,
and we don't have time.

38:46.425 --> 38:50.593
I wanted a little more
time with you
before it was too late.

38:53.265 --> 38:54.631
Oh.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.200
<i> ¶ Put my heart</i>
<i> And soul into this song ¶</i>

39:23.829 --> 39:25.095
I love you, Jen.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.132
I love you, too, Khalil.

39:29.668 --> 39:33.303
