WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:03.903
Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

00:05.038 --> 00:06.106
You'll be starring
in "Wigloose."

00:07.507 --> 00:09.075
all: [singing] There's a queen
that wants to come through

00:09.976 --> 00:12.245
Oh, everybody's
going wigloose

00:12.846 --> 00:15.882
[all cheering]

00:17.017 --> 00:20.353
Who should go home tonight
and why?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.523
Salina has been
in the bottom a lot.

00:24.257 --> 00:25.392
Salina EsTitties.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.494
Okay.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.029
If I had to be honest,
I'm tired of being

00:30.196 --> 00:30.930
at the Sasha Colby
meet and greet.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.298
Loosey's drag

00:33.466 --> 00:33.867
I would have to say,
for lack of better word,

00:35.135 --> 00:36.102
is a little
on the more generic side.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.105
[dramatic music]

00:40.006 --> 00:41.274
Anetra, condragulations.

00:42.642 --> 00:42.876
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.011
Yes.
[applause]

00:46.212 --> 00:48.214
Loosey LaDuca,
shantay, you stay.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.584
Salina EsTitties, sashay away.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.058
[tense music]

01:03.129 --> 01:05.665
My girl Salina has gone.

01:06.399 --> 01:06.699
She fought a good fight.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.601
She's always been a fighter.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.605
Maybe, like, a tearful warrior.
[laughs]

01:13.773 --> 01:14.207
And I hope that she's proud
of herself

01:15.642 --> 01:17.177
'cause I'm very proud of her
and I know LA is proud of her.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.480
"Guess I got
what I 'deserved.'"

01:21.481 --> 01:22.849
- Ooh!
- "Love you hos."

01:23.316 --> 01:24.451
Well--

01:25.885 --> 01:28.021
She's obviously upset we said
that she deserved to go home.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.222
She's pissed. I get it.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.125
My name was said too,
and it sucks.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.062
The mirror message feels
a little bit...

01:37.163 --> 01:39.299
pointed right now
and a little bit salty.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.234
And by a little,
I mean, like, a lot.

01:42.735 --> 01:43.837
In "Untucked," Salina was
a little upset with Loosey

01:44.604 --> 01:45.271
and why she chose her.

01:46.406 --> 01:46.673
I know you had to say a name,
but, like,

01:47.907 --> 01:48.508
I feel like you actually have
people in here

01:49.809 --> 01:50.009
that you don't really care
too much about

01:51.111 --> 01:51.344
that you would love
to see gone.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.746
And why didn't you say
their names?

01:54.380 --> 01:55.014
I understand.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.851
- Well, say their names.
- But the--

01:59.018 --> 01:59.152
- I understand.
- Say their names!

02:00.286 --> 02:00.487
Because there's people
you don't care for

02:01.554 --> 02:01.688
that you would love
to see gone.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.056
And I know it's not me.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.192
[laughing] Oh, my God.

02:07.060 --> 02:07.927
I'm happy to still be here.

02:09.162 --> 02:09.462
You know, I plan on being here
the whole time.

02:10.563 --> 02:11.397
But it's hard
because I feel like

02:12.432 --> 02:14.167
I got nothing
but positive critiques,

02:15.034 --> 02:16.169
especially about the Rusical.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.539
And so it was really surprising
to see myself in the bottom.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.207
Not again.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.143
And I'm really,
really gonna miss her.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.911
Hunty.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.781
Tea has been spilt.
Feelings have been shared.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.417
And it stinks in here, honey.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.521
All right, let's get rowdy.

02:35.121 --> 02:35.588
Here we go.

02:36.322 --> 02:36.723
We had to say someone.

02:37.323 --> 02:37.991
Yes, we did.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.193
I felt like this week,
everyone done well.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.095
So if I said
someone should go home,

02:43.530 --> 02:45.331
it would have been purely
out of my personal thoughts.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.201
If I wanted to be a bitch,
I could have said Loosey.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.970
But I gave
my perfect pageant answer

02:52.105 --> 02:53.406
and said that I would
send Sasha home.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.842
So for once, I'm patting
myself on the back

02:56.743 --> 02:57.844
for being in my congenial era.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.147
Well, I gave
a pretty long explanation.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.149
Everything that I said
on the runway

03:03.883 --> 03:05.518
is 110% how I feel.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.924
I think that I did it in a way
that was not meant to be

03:11.791 --> 03:14.160
disrespectful or demeaning.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.563
Listen, I said it
and I meant it.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.732
Loosey's drag is
more on the generic side.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.834
I understand
that you had to say someone.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.404
But I still, you know,
can obviously

03:25.471 --> 03:26.272
- wholeheartedly disagree with...
- Yeah!

03:27.307 --> 03:27.507
- With what you said.
- Of course.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.242
You know,
because I'm going to.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.511
Luxx seemed to really enjoy
my drag

03:32.879 --> 03:34.347
when I was helping her
during the comedy challenge,

03:35.215 --> 03:37.183
which I find interesting.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.153
I'm cool
because I love what I do.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.188
I think I'm very unique,
and I don't think

03:43.590 --> 03:46.726
it's a bad thing that I'm
very good at a lot of things.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.229
I think
that Loosey is holding back

03:49.963 --> 03:50.897
her temper tantrum.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.233
And I'm low-key hoping
it comes out, baby.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.335
I'm hoping that she shows
her real self.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.671
Like Ru says,
"Reveal yourself."

03:59.539 --> 04:01.274
But now, we're the top five.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.978
Like, we are at that,
like, homestretch.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.080
I'm not focused
on, like, friends.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.349
I'm not focused
on eating, sleeping.

04:10.216 --> 04:10.583
Ooh, bitch, I need to eat.

04:11.184 --> 04:11.718
[laughter]

04:12.852 --> 04:14.554
[singing] Shit's
getting gaggy!

04:15.922 --> 04:17.490
It is crazy how high
the stakes are right now.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.593
Everybody is here to secure
that spot in the top four.

04:21.060 --> 04:21.894
Ow.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.530
And that is a little scary

04:25.398 --> 04:28.801
because someone has to go home.

04:29.936 --> 04:30.270
[whispering]
That fucking hurt.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.940
Who is it gonna be?
You never know.

04:35.742 --> 04:36.743
[whispering] Ow.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.113
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

04:41.114 --> 04:41.314
The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

04:42.181 --> 04:42.749
receives a one-year supply

04:43.950 --> 04:44.851
of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics

04:46.052 --> 04:48.955
and a gag-worthy grand prize
of $200,000,

04:49.689 --> 04:50.456
served by Cash App,

04:51.658 --> 04:53.626
with extra-special guest judge
Hayley Kiyoko.

04:54.494 --> 04:54.927
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

04:55.828 --> 04:56.262
May the best
drag queen win

04:56.996 --> 04:58.231
Best drag queen win

04:59.966 --> 05:02.535
[upbeat music]

05:03.202 --> 05:03.736
- Ooh.
- Oh.

05:04.337 --> 05:04.737
Oh, oh, oh.

05:05.672 --> 05:05.872
It's a new day
in the Werkroom,

05:06.973 --> 05:08.274
and we are officially
at the top five.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.443
And bitch, I am so excited.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.146
I'm gonna be in the top four,
I promise that.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.481
Oh, my God, top five.

05:16.382 --> 05:16.783
- Can you believe?
- Oh, my God.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.284
There's five.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.585
Yes.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.322
It's going to be, like,
a fight to the finish

05:23.189 --> 05:24.957
because we're all so good.

05:26.125 --> 05:26.259
Well, it's gonna come down
to, like,

05:27.126 --> 05:27.727
the tiniest little detail.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.028
- Tiniest.
- Yeah.

05:30.196 --> 05:30.730
But I am gonna win this week,
I promise you.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.333
- Ooh!
- Well, girls, we shall see.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.001
[laughter]

05:35.735 --> 05:36.803
Hello, hello, hello.

05:37.403 --> 05:38.705
[all cheering]

05:39.906 --> 05:41.374
Mother...
[in deep voice] Has arrived.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.710
Ladykins, after spending

05:44.677 --> 05:46.546
these several many weeks together,

05:47.613 --> 05:50.216
you must know each other
inside and out.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.484
Oh.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.521
So the time has come
to put that to the test.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.223
For today's mini challenge,

05:58.424 --> 06:01.260
we're playing everyone's
favorite new game show,

06:01.861 --> 06:02.462
"Spill the T."

06:03.463 --> 06:05.698
- all: Ooh!
- "Spill the T," hon.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.969
Queens, please say hello
to my lovely cohost,

06:11.404 --> 06:14.006
the president of Anastasia
Beverly Hills, Norvina.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.375
- Hi.
- Hi, Ru.

06:15.975 --> 06:16.843
Hi, queens.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.680
Now, Norvina, today is
all about spilling the tea.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.015
So are you ready
to play the game?

06:24.183 --> 06:25.318
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.321
- [laughter]
- Good answer.

06:29.188 --> 06:29.756
Here's how the game works.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.326
I'll ask for the tea, like
who's the prettiest queen?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.095
Then you will all vote
for yourselves

06:37.096 --> 06:38.264
or for one
of your fellow queens.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.834
If your answer matches
the majority of the group,

06:42.435 --> 06:43.269
you get a point.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.006
And in the end, the queen
with the most points wins.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.275
Queens, y'all ready?
all: Yes.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.111
Okay, let's spill the tea.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.280
[children cheering]

06:55.748 --> 06:59.185
First question: which queen
makes you laugh the hardest?

06:59.786 --> 07:01.053
Think about it.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.389
Okay.

07:04.524 --> 07:05.391
I know you laughing
at yourself, huh?

07:06.292 --> 07:06.559
Literally.
[laughter]

07:07.427 --> 07:08.661
The majority vote, Mistress.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.564
Everyone gets a point
except Anetra.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.599
Well, I hope
someone's keeping score.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.935
- Norvina?
- Ru, I have one thing to say.

07:16.569 --> 07:17.370
- Bam.
- Ooh.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.505
Anetra, get your head
in the game, bitch.

07:20.673 --> 07:21.674
- [laughter]
- All right, next question.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.745
Which queen thinks
she's the smartest?

07:26.345 --> 07:27.780
[laughter]

07:28.514 --> 07:29.649
Loosey is the majority.

07:30.516 --> 07:31.584
She thinks she's the smartest.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.921
I know I'm the smartest
because I just got the point.

07:35.521 --> 07:36.689
[laughter]

07:37.557 --> 07:39.192
Which queen is the shadiest?

07:41.561 --> 07:42.528
It's unanimous.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.465
[laughter]

07:46.199 --> 07:46.899
Ru, gather them.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.801
[laughter]

07:49.669 --> 07:51.437
Which queen is the hairiest?

07:52.171 --> 07:52.839
I'm not gonna say where.

07:53.573 --> 07:54.440
That's up to you.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.144
- Luxx got Loosey.
- Oh!

07:59.011 --> 08:00.112
Luxx said I was the hairiest.

08:00.980 --> 08:01.347
I was like, wait, what, girl?

08:02.348 --> 08:03.115
I'm standing
next to Mistress, okay?

08:03.850 --> 08:04.217
The Beast of the East.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.185
Mistress is
the majority answer.

08:07.753 --> 08:10.623
Let's check the scores
with Norvina.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.058
Sickening, no?

08:12.658 --> 08:13.860
Interesting.

08:14.727 --> 08:15.595
Here's our next question.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.431
Which queen is
most likely to steal

08:19.599 --> 08:22.134
your Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics?

08:22.869 --> 08:23.803
Oh, it's unanimous.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.205
[laughter]

08:27.073 --> 08:29.175
Shady, hairy, and a thief.

08:30.042 --> 08:30.977
[laughter]
Next question.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.715
Which queen is most likely
to steal your man?

08:36.749 --> 08:38.117
So I think Sasha wins
on that one.

08:38.584 --> 08:39.519
Girl.

08:40.887 --> 08:44.123
Which queen is most likely
to have a sugar daddy?

08:45.157 --> 08:47.393
Oh!
Luxx, Luxx, Luxx, Luxx, Sasha.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.061
[laughter]

08:49.795 --> 08:51.197
Norvina, what say you?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.332
You better walk
that fucking score.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.234
[laughter]

08:56.402 --> 08:58.304
This last question
is worth five points.

08:58.905 --> 08:59.372
all: Ooh.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.608
Which queen is going home
next?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.710
[dramatic music]

09:05.177 --> 09:05.745
Ready.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.748
- [laughter]
- Girl.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.984
One, two, three.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.421
[laughing]

09:16.022 --> 09:18.190
[laughter]

09:18.925 --> 09:19.792
You did yourself too?

09:20.526 --> 09:21.761
Yes! I know you hos.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.129
I'm smart.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.631
I wanna win this challenge,
so I picked myself.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.469
Okay queens, the winner
of today's mini challenge is...

09:31.771 --> 09:33.172
Loosey LaDuca.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.808
- [applause]
- Look at that.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.177
Lo and behold, who wins?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.546
In the words of Mistress,
I'm in my winning era.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.915
Condragulations, Loosey.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.619
You've won $5,000 worth
of cosmetics

09:47.486 --> 09:48.487
from Anastasia Beverly Hills.

09:49.088 --> 09:49.689
Oh, shit!

09:50.723 --> 09:51.223
Mistress,
don't steal my shit.

09:51.824 --> 09:52.725
[laughter]

09:53.593 --> 09:54.794
Now thank you, Norvina.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.264
You can come back and spill
the tea with us any time.

09:58.864 --> 09:59.665
Thank you, Ru.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.401
And queens, just remember
if you can't love yourself,

10:03.002 --> 10:03.703
use a concealer.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.172
[laughter]

10:07.273 --> 10:09.075
My girls, you know,
a lot of people

10:10.242 --> 10:11.143
have influenced me
over the years,

10:11.877 --> 10:13.613
from David Bowie to Cher

10:14.747 --> 10:16.716
to my high school
drama teacher,

10:17.516 --> 10:18.851
- Bill Pannell.
- Aww.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.388
You know, Mr. Pannell was
the first person to tell me,

10:23.489 --> 10:26.492
"Ru, do not take life
too seriously."

10:27.727 --> 10:30.696
Those simple yet powerful words
made a big impact,

10:32.031 --> 10:33.332
and it just goes to show you
that a good teacher

10:34.100 --> 10:35.735
can change your life.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.372
And today, it's your turn
to change the lives

10:40.806 --> 10:44.310
of some good teachers
with the miracle of drag.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.545
Please give a warm
"Drag Race" welcome

10:47.446 --> 10:49.181
to five hardworking teachers

10:50.249 --> 10:51.884
who are about to become
your students.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.352
Ooh.

10:53.853 --> 10:54.720
Yes!

10:55.521 --> 10:57.256
- Hi!
- Yes, welcome.

10:57.757 --> 10:58.824
Hello.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.160
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.496
Ladies, please
introduce yourselves.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.464
Hi. I'm Mrs. March-Banks.

11:06.632 --> 11:07.199
I teach
middle school humanities.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.568
I'm Ms. Reyes.
I teach first grade.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.938
I'm Mrs. Wallace, and I teach
middle school choir.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.241
I'm Mrs. Mahoney.
I teach kindergarten.

11:16.509 --> 11:16.942
I'm Ms. Tang,
and I teach high school art.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.845
So wonderful
to have you here.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.915
My queens, for this week's
maxi challenge,

11:24.083 --> 11:26.919
you need to transform
these fearless educators

11:27.653 --> 11:29.889
into flawless glamazons.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.992
Loosey LaDuca, since you won
the mini challenge,

11:34.193 --> 11:35.161
you get to choose
your teacher first

11:36.595 --> 11:39.298
and then pair up the rest
of the queens and teachers.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.200
Okay.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.170
[gasps] No.

11:44.670 --> 11:45.504
Fuck.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.774
All right, so, Loosey,
which teacher do you choose?

11:49.408 --> 11:50.076
Mrs. Wallace.

11:50.976 --> 11:51.877
- [applause]
- Hi!

11:53.012 --> 11:54.513
Who do you choose
for Mistress?

11:55.681 --> 11:58.684
Mistress will be
with Ms. Tang.

11:59.618 --> 12:00.619
- Yes.
- All right, Ms. Tang.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.122
Why would you just hand me
someone who is practically

12:03.989 --> 12:04.957
the same person as me almost?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.393
Maybe she really is
in her congeniality era.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.362
Where's your hall pass?
[laughter]

12:11.230 --> 12:12.898
Who do you choose for Anetra?

12:13.666 --> 12:14.967
- Mrs. Mahoney.
- Yay!

12:16.068 --> 12:19.171
- [laughs]
- Who do you choose for Sasha?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.107
Mrs. March-Banks.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.210
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey! Nice to meet you.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.512
Oh!

12:27.847 --> 12:29.181
I think that she is
trying to get revenge on me

12:30.449 --> 12:32.585
by not giving me
the only other Black person

12:33.185 --> 12:34.487
in the room.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.289
Okay, girl, that's fucked up.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.994
That leaves Ms. Reyes
with Luxx Noir London.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.463
- Hi.
- Hello, hello!

12:45.631 --> 12:45.998
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

12:47.399 --> 12:48.300
- You're in good hands.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

12:49.435 --> 12:49.735
All right, queens,
we are looking

12:50.970 --> 12:52.505
for a strong drag
family resemblance

12:53.405 --> 12:55.040
between you and your teacher.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.745
And to help you put some swerve
in your bell curve,

13:01.046 --> 13:04.049
you may use pads
provided by Planet Pepper.

13:04.650 --> 13:05.217
all: Ooh.

13:06.185 --> 13:06.519
- [school bell rings]
- Oh.

13:06.986 --> 13:07.953
Uh-oh.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.189
You know
what that bell means.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.491
It means class is in session.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.127
And this year,
we're gonna rule the school.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.428
[laughter]

13:17.296 --> 13:19.398
Racers, start your engines.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.334
And may the best
drag queen win.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.036
[whispering]
Michelle Visage is PG.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.438
Pass it on.
[laughter]

13:28.174 --> 13:30.242
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sasha.

13:30.843 --> 13:31.443
I'm Layla.

13:32.611 --> 13:33.179
- I can sit here.
- Okay, sounds good.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.447
I'm so freaking out
right now.

13:36.182 --> 13:36.849
Like, I'm so excited.

13:37.917 --> 13:38.617
This week,
we are transforming

13:39.752 --> 13:40.986
fabulous teachers,
the people who educate

13:42.154 --> 13:43.856
our youth and future
into drag queens.

13:44.957 --> 13:45.257
It's, like, literally
my favorite show.

13:46.425 --> 13:46.692
And I'm not even
just saying that.

13:47.693 --> 13:48.227
- [laughs]
- [whispering] Same.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.796
I definitely got the teacher
who I was hoping for.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.801
Mrs. Mahoney is, like, DTD.
Like, down to drag, mama.

13:56.936 --> 13:57.870
- You are so beautiful.
- Aw, thank you.

13:58.771 --> 13:59.004
What is your background?

14:00.072 --> 14:00.773
I'm half Filipino,
half white.

14:00.873 --> 14:01.674
[gasps] No way.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.042
Me too!

14:04.410 --> 14:05.144
Is there anything, like,
you're, like, insecure about?

14:06.312 --> 14:07.446
Like, for me, it's like,
my skin is a big thing

14:08.480 --> 14:08.747
because I have
a lot of textured skin.

14:09.615 --> 14:10.049
Do you have anything like that?

14:11.083 --> 14:11.684
Something I'm the most
nervous about

14:13.052 --> 14:15.487
is just walking on stage
and being in front of people.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.324
Like, I'm naturally just
such a reserved person.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.059
The more drag
I, like, put on her,

14:21.160 --> 14:22.394
I think the more
we're gonna reveal her

14:22.995 --> 14:23.929
or RuVeal her.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.064
One can hope.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.068
I'm so excited
that I got you.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.470
- I'm so excited you picked me.
- Yes.

14:32.838 --> 14:33.839
I picked you because your
energy was just so, like, open,

14:34.940 --> 14:35.541
and you're so smiley,
and just, like--

14:36.709 --> 14:37.209
I feel like we have
a similar energy.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.311
Mrs. Wallace is
a middle school teacher,

14:40.045 --> 14:41.080
and she is sweet as pie.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.483
And it's my job to make
Mrs. Wallace step out

14:45.351 --> 14:45.951
of her comfort zone a little.

14:47.052 --> 14:47.853
We're gonna give you
va-va-va-voom.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.890
My drag aesthetic
is very voluptuous.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.693
Just to give you an idea,
my bra size is a 38H.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.262
I'm a 32HH.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.697
Yes!
You're double H!

14:59.865 --> 15:00.232
Have you ever worn
a corset before?

15:01.233 --> 15:01.734
- No.
- Like, we want--

15:02.334 --> 15:02.835
Mm-hmm.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.504
Obviously,
in the LaDuca dynasty,

15:06.372 --> 15:06.906
you need to be voluptuous.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.910
And Mrs. Wallace is perfect
in all the right places,

15:11.644 --> 15:12.344
if you know what I mean.

15:12.811 --> 15:13.979
Oof!

15:15.180 --> 15:15.314
What grade level
do you work with?

15:16.048 --> 15:16.415
9, 10, 11, and 12.

15:17.549 --> 15:18.350
Those are, like,
really, like,

15:19.451 --> 15:20.352
years where you develop
and find yourself.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.255
Do you ever, like, see, like,
really big changes in people?

15:23.989 --> 15:24.924
I do. I love it.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.460
I love being in those chapters
of their lives.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.130
So right away, we are vibing.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.164
We are both Latina.

15:33.032 --> 15:33.632
She's a first generation.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.868
And I find out about her
being a queer teacher,

15:37.069 --> 15:38.437
so I am, like, already
in love with Ms. Tang.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.139
When I was a teenager, like,

15:41.273 --> 15:42.708
I would have gagged
if I even had a teacher

15:43.575 --> 15:44.376
who was able to be themselves.

15:45.744 --> 15:46.312
I'm sure that even if
your students don't say it,

15:47.446 --> 15:47.680
I'm sure they look up to you
so much.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.582
And, like, they see
someone who is like them,

15:51.984 --> 15:52.384
or maybe they feel that way
and they are not allowed

15:53.118 --> 15:53.652
to be like that at home.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.688
Mistress,
you're gonna make me cry now.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.122
Girl, I've been crying
this whole season.

15:57.856 --> 15:58.590
You have no idea.

16:00.059 --> 16:00.326
That was, like, a big part
for me, like, growing up.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.563
Like, my whole family
is, like, really macho man,

16:05.698 --> 16:06.999
and, like, just being different
was so hard.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.002
I wish I had someone like you
to see that there are

16:11.337 --> 16:12.838
queer people out there
who can have successful lives

16:13.439 --> 16:14.373
and be happy.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.041
She's a high school
art teacher.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.777
And I feel like
for every queer person,

16:19.645 --> 16:20.279
that's kind of a safe space.

16:21.146 --> 16:21.647
So right away, I'm just, like,

16:22.815 --> 16:23.315
just spilling my heart out
to her.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.385
I think when I first
came out, I was afraid.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.322
Yes, I do live in a state
where we are accepted,

16:31.390 --> 16:31.890
and we have
certain protections.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.692
But it's still scary.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.861
But the moment
when a student tells me

16:37.262 --> 16:39.865
that they feel safe in my
classroom, it's all worth it.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.001
Ms. Tang has
a piece of my heart,

16:43.168 --> 16:44.136
and I'm gonna bring
that fierce, ferocious

16:44.870 --> 16:45.771
drag side out of her.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.774
- This is llorar. Ay.
- Wipe your tears.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.143
We gotta get ready to win,
put our game face on.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.378
This is how you gotta do it.

16:53.645 --> 16:53.779
You gotta let
all the emotions out now.

16:54.913 --> 16:55.180
That way, we can just be
cunts to everybody.

16:56.115 --> 16:56.281
- Yes, yes.
- I'm sorry.

16:57.016 --> 16:57.950
Then we can be bitches.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.418
[laughs]

17:00.285 --> 17:00.786
Tell me about yourself.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.057
I have two wonderful sons
and an amazing husband.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.126
- Do you watch "Drag Race"?
- I do.

17:08.060 --> 17:08.560
- Yes.
- I love "Drag Race."

17:09.428 --> 17:09.895
Do you make him watch it?

17:10.996 --> 17:11.196
You know, it's my husband
and I.

17:12.197 --> 17:12.998
- We watch together.
- Yes.

17:14.133 --> 17:14.666
I'm definitely,
like, a sexier girl.

17:15.667 --> 17:15.934
- Ooh, I like that.
- Yeah.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.069
I'm all in.

17:18.037 --> 17:18.270
I'm like,
the bigger, the better.

17:19.138 --> 17:19.471
- Good.
- I'm here.

17:20.606 --> 17:21.573
- Let's just go big.
- All right, perfect.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.476
Mrs. March-Banks is game
for everything.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.180
She's familiar with the padding
and the boob plates.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.284
She wants, like, the full
padded dream right now.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.353
Now, granted,
I myself have never dabbled.

17:35.087 --> 17:35.888
[laughing] Okay.

17:36.488 --> 17:37.990
But, I mean,

17:39.158 --> 17:40.325
there's a first time
for everything, right?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.729
So Mother is taking the lead
of the daughter and decided,

17:44.897 --> 17:45.864
I'm gonna pad on top
of these boobies.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.100
I'm gonna pad
on top of this body.

17:48.967 --> 17:49.902
Bitch, y'all thought already?

17:50.636 --> 17:52.571
How is the body?

17:53.172 --> 17:53.872
Oh, wow.

17:55.074 --> 17:55.974
Oh, my goodness,
what do you think?

17:57.342 --> 17:59.745
So we're gonna give you,
like, the Mae West exclusive.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.181
I'm kind of excited for this.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.416
Work, body.

18:05.717 --> 18:06.518
What are some of the things
that you would like

18:07.386 --> 18:09.521
your drag persona to convey?

18:10.456 --> 18:11.423
I want to be a queen.
[laughs]

18:12.024 --> 18:13.025
Okay, okay.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.294
So you want the full
glitz-glam moment.

18:15.894 --> 18:16.695
Yes, yeah.

18:17.896 --> 18:18.831
Anything you want to do
to me, I'm okay with it.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.099
Okay.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.401
So Ms. Reyes is
open to anything

18:23.268 --> 18:24.403
I feel would look best on her.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.639
She's just giving me
complete control.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.241
There is going to take
some work

18:30.609 --> 18:32.244
to get where we want to be,
but I definitely think

18:33.112 --> 18:34.179
that we are gonna turn it out.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.584
So this is the fabric
that I chose for your look.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.018
Uh-huh.

18:41.320 --> 18:41.987
Luxx is so focused on getting
the garments together

18:43.355 --> 18:44.423
that she's not even taking time
to connect with Ms. Reyes.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.625
Now, is there anything
I can do to help?

18:47.493 --> 18:49.862
Um... I don't really think so.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.299
I think right now,
I kind of just gotta,

18:55.467 --> 18:55.834
like, get started
on making them.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.236
- Okay.
- Child.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.205
I think that Luxx is in
her delusional La La Land

19:01.406 --> 19:01.874
and thinks that she's
about to turn it out.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.077
And I'm rooting for my girl,
but Luxx can give

19:06.211 --> 19:06.778
all the confidence
she wants to,

19:07.646 --> 19:08.614
but I see the panic in her eye

19:09.615 --> 19:10.983
and I hope
she gets it together.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.352
[upbeat music]

19:14.486 --> 19:15.587
"Yes, I do have
a high credit score."

19:16.722 --> 19:17.489
Yes, I do have
a high credit score,

19:18.524 --> 19:19.825
- thank you very much.
- Period!

19:21.026 --> 19:21.527
So tell them that
with the walk now.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.995
Okay.

19:24.429 --> 19:24.897
Loosey, my daughter has
something she wants to say.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.231
What?

19:27.499 --> 19:27.666
I want to challenge you
to a walk-off.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.068
Oh, what?

19:31.203 --> 19:31.837
Wait, we have
a challenge, ladies.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.439
We have a walk-off
challenge already.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.742
Oh, wow. They don't want us.

19:37.943 --> 19:38.076
- They don't want it.
- They don't want us!

19:39.244 --> 19:39.878
- They don't want it.
- Ferocity, tell 'em.

19:40.979 --> 19:41.313
- They don't want us in this.
- Ooh!

19:41.780 --> 19:43.849
Oh!

19:44.583 --> 19:45.117
All right, ready?

19:45.584 --> 19:46.885
Go!

19:47.753 --> 19:48.520
Eat her up. Strut, bitch.

19:49.788 --> 19:49.922
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- Strut. Pose.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.356
Oh, oh!

19:52.191 --> 19:52.991
- Yeah!
- Oh, come on.

19:53.825 --> 19:54.493
- Yes, Lala.
- Yes.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.361
Yes, Ms. Lala.

19:56.962 --> 19:57.563
Mama, she ate.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.231
- No, Madam ate, bitch.
- She ate.

20:00.098 --> 20:00.499
Let's ask the audience.

20:01.366 --> 20:01.700
What do y'all think? Who won?

20:02.301 --> 20:02.868
I don't know.

20:03.735 --> 20:04.069
Loosey's daughter is giving.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.538
[laughter]

20:07.439 --> 20:07.906
She beat her.
She beat her.

20:09.007 --> 20:09.775
I'm sorry, America.
She beat her.

20:10.642 --> 20:10.976
You know what? Let them.

20:12.311 --> 20:12.477
Because when we transform,
bitch, it's over.

20:13.078 --> 20:13.745
It's ours.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.214
We're unbothered.

20:15.681 --> 20:16.215
Hmm.

20:16.949 --> 20:17.683
Loosey swears Lala won,

20:18.750 --> 20:19.551
but I think we all know
the real winner.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.386
[laughter]

20:22.254 --> 20:23.055
- Perfect.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:24.189 --> 20:24.356
I could play dress-up
with you all day.

20:24.957 --> 20:25.357
I love this.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.025
Yes, get into it. Feel it.

20:28.126 --> 20:28.560
- Don't be shy.
- I already see it.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.295
You're gonna be
the next Mistress.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.096
I love it.

20:32.531 --> 20:33.932
This week, we are going
to be transforming teachers

20:34.700 --> 20:35.701
into our drag families.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.003
Are you ready to go,
like, 100% so I can win?

20:38.503 --> 20:39.271
Yes.

20:40.439 --> 20:40.872
Would you be down
to shave your eyebrows?

20:41.373 --> 20:43.609
Oh.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.577
Hey, twirlfriends.

20:46.511 --> 20:46.979
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, mama.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.281
I'm here for the PTA meeting.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.916
[laughter]

20:52.117 --> 20:53.885
All right,
Sasha and Mrs. Marsh-Banks.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.655
Oh, my goodness,
those beautiful flowers.

20:57.823 --> 20:58.490
- Do you have a drag name yet?
- I do.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.192
It's Ferocity Colby.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.360
I love that.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.295
Are there things
that are off-limits

21:04.162 --> 21:04.896
in this challenge for you?

21:05.564 --> 21:06.231
- No.
- No.

21:07.399 --> 21:07.899
Isn't that amazing?
She's, like, go for it.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.268
- I love that.
- Whatever.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.236
I was like, if I'm here,
I'm gonna go big.

21:11.837 --> 21:12.504
That's right.

21:13.905 --> 21:14.039
I've yet to work her up
to, like, the pasties.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.440
[laughter]

21:16.308 --> 21:16.575
What do you have in mind?

21:17.643 --> 21:18.310
- Is that your sketchbook there?
- Yes.

21:19.678 --> 21:20.012
You know, Ru, you know
I'm a snatched kind of gal.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.080
- Yes.
- I love a good pony.

21:23.248 --> 21:23.448
And what a great
head of hair there.

21:23.915 --> 21:24.683
Yes.

21:25.817 --> 21:26.418
That's a great head
of hair to snatch.

21:27.519 --> 21:28.620
So we're gonna be
very tropical.

21:29.221 --> 21:29.688
It's dusk.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.323
The luau music's playing

21:32.491 --> 21:32.824
and she's waiting
for her husband,

21:33.892 --> 21:35.394
who's waiting for her
to ravage him.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.562
[laughter]

21:38.430 --> 21:39.798
We both got booty naturally,

21:41.033 --> 21:41.333
but we gonna really give them
booty on the--

21:42.668 --> 21:43.001
you know, we gonna give Loosey
a run for her money.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.369
[laughter]

21:45.604 --> 21:46.638
This is one of my
favorite challenges

21:48.040 --> 21:49.641
because you really get to see
not only the camaraderie

21:50.809 --> 21:52.277
but the artistry
that the queens have

21:53.178 --> 21:53.645
brought to this competition.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.113
So we can't wait.

21:55.747 --> 21:56.315
both: Yay!

21:57.549 --> 21:57.816
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.484
Mistress, Ms. Tang.

22:00.085 --> 22:00.786
Come on over.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.255
- Hi.
- Mistress and Ms. Tang.

22:03.855 --> 22:04.423
Have you bonded?

22:05.624 --> 22:06.658
Yes, we are like
two peas in a pod.

22:07.859 --> 22:08.560
I feel like we are,
like, really vibing.

22:09.661 --> 22:09.795
Even from when
they were lined up,

22:10.829 --> 22:11.163
I immediately was like,
"I want her."

22:12.197 --> 22:12.964
Wow.
Have you given her a drag name?

22:14.032 --> 22:15.500
So she is gonna be

22:16.101 --> 22:16.768
Madam Thang.

22:17.636 --> 22:17.836
- Yeah.
- I love it.

22:18.970 --> 22:19.204
Is this an outfit
you're making,

22:20.405 --> 22:20.605
or is it something
that you brought?

22:21.707 --> 22:23.175
- I am making both of them.
- Wow.

22:24.576 --> 22:25.811
We're gonna be utilizing
black velvet and white velvet.

22:27.245 --> 22:27.846
I want to make sure that they
have the family resemblance

22:29.014 --> 22:29.448
but they're still
very different.

22:29.548 --> 22:29.948
Sure.

22:30.816 --> 22:30.949
So it's gonna be chef's kiss.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.050
Oh, my goodness.

22:33.151 --> 22:33.318
I'm thinking
about every element

22:34.353 --> 22:34.853
to make sure
that I secure my win.

22:35.921 --> 22:36.588
And of course,
a gown will also help

22:37.789 --> 22:38.557
hide a little kitten heel,
you know.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.393
I guess I might know
from experience.

22:42.561 --> 22:43.462
Now, you both have
Latin backgrounds.

22:44.596 --> 22:45.430
- Is that part of the bond?
- Yes.

22:46.798 --> 22:47.532
I was letting her know, like,
it's so important for us

22:48.767 --> 22:49.267
to be seen
because we haven't really

22:50.635 --> 22:52.504
seen people like us growing up
who are openly queer.

22:53.338 --> 22:53.739
- Are you queer?
- I am.

22:54.673 --> 22:55.307
I love that.
That's fabulous.

22:56.408 --> 22:56.708
What have you learned
about Mistress

22:57.876 --> 22:58.744
in the short time
you've been together?

22:59.878 --> 23:00.746
- Living life authentically.
- Yeah.

23:01.913 --> 23:02.614
Has that always been
something you've done?

23:03.081 --> 23:03.782
No.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.685
I didn't come out
until my late 20s.

23:07.552 --> 23:07.719
- Late 20s?
- Yeah.

23:08.887 --> 23:09.421
So it's only been
a couple years,

23:10.355 --> 23:11.923
and it's taken me a lot
to learn

23:13.258 --> 23:15.227
that it's okay to live
your authentic and true self.

23:16.094 --> 23:16.328
One of the greatest lessons

23:17.462 --> 23:18.663
you'll ever teach
your students.

23:19.865 --> 23:20.432
- To be yourself.
- To be yourself.

23:21.032 --> 23:21.533
Yeah. Exactly.

23:22.467 --> 23:22.968
- I love it.
- Thank you.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.303
Do you think you're gonna be
a shady queen,

23:26.171 --> 23:27.539
a nice queen, a fun queen--

23:28.640 --> 23:28.940
what kind of queen
do you think you'll be?

23:30.342 --> 23:30.509
I think you're gonna
have to wait and find out.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.344
- Okay, all right.
- Ooh!

23:33.211 --> 23:33.578
All right, go get to work.

23:34.479 --> 23:35.046
- Thank you.
- And do good.

23:35.647 --> 23:36.381
Thank you.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.018
All right, Anetra,
Mrs. Mahoney, come on down.

23:40.685 --> 23:41.553
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.989
What an interesting pair.
[laughter]

23:44.856 --> 23:45.490
Honestly, I was asking,

23:46.725 --> 23:47.459
"What do you see yourself as,
like, in drag?"

23:48.560 --> 23:49.428
And she was like,
"Something a little edgy

23:50.162 --> 23:51.129
and, like, a bad bitch."

23:52.431 --> 23:52.964
And oh, my God,
that's exactly what I am.

23:53.865 --> 23:54.199
- [laughs]
- It's true.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.734
When this one gets into drag,

23:56.835 --> 23:57.569
the energy is
completely different.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.206
There's this runway walk
that is killer.

24:02.207 --> 24:02.674
- Okay.
- Absolutely killer.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.109
Have you walked in heels yet?

24:04.976 --> 24:05.477
Yes, we practiced earlier.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.345
I got some work to do on that.

24:08.280 --> 24:08.947
- It's all in the hips.
- Okay.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.515
Are you afraid of your hips?

24:11.550 --> 24:12.818
No, not afraid.
[laughs]

24:13.952 --> 24:14.453
I think they could use
some love, though.

24:15.053 --> 24:15.887
[laughter]

24:16.822 --> 24:18.423
- Can't we all?
- Don't we all?

24:19.424 --> 24:20.025
Now, what,
you teach kindergarten?

24:20.492 --> 24:21.126
Yeah.

24:22.260 --> 24:22.861
What do you hope
your kids will

24:23.728 --> 24:24.896
learn from this experience?

24:25.630 --> 24:26.531
Just, like, be brave.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.334
Don't let your insecurities
get in front of you.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.269
Like, just be willing
to have fun and try.

24:32.437 --> 24:32.671
Are you willing
to have fun and try?

24:33.405 --> 24:33.738
I am willing, yes.

24:34.206 --> 24:34.806
Okay.

24:35.674 --> 24:36.241
You're gonna be fabulous.

24:37.042 --> 24:37.709
- Okay.
- I cannot wait.

24:38.310 --> 24:38.710
Thank you.

24:39.444 --> 24:40.378
All right, thank you.

24:41.112 --> 24:42.214
Luxx and Ms. Reyes.

24:43.081 --> 24:43.548
What do you have planned there?

24:44.950 --> 24:47.185
We have kind of, like,
a gown moment for Ms. Reyes

24:48.053 --> 24:49.654
in this gorgeous aqua blue,

24:50.622 --> 24:52.691
because her drag name is

24:53.291 --> 24:54.259
Asia Azul.

24:54.860 --> 24:55.994
I love that.

24:56.728 --> 24:57.062
What about heels?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.130
Are you opposed
to wearing heels?

25:00.565 --> 25:02.167
I'm gonna try my hardest
because I want Luxx to win.

25:02.901 --> 25:03.235
[laughs] - Yeah.

25:04.236 --> 25:04.369
How long have you been
a teacher?

25:04.970 --> 25:05.737
27 years now.

25:07.105 --> 25:08.940
What do you think your kids
will think of Asia Azul?

25:09.808 --> 25:10.675
"That's my teacher up there.

25:11.543 --> 25:11.910
"She's not gonna judge me.

25:12.978 --> 25:13.211
She's gonna accept me
for who I am."

25:13.678 --> 25:14.312
Yes.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.248
Not only that,
but the kids will

25:17.382 --> 25:18.950
get to experience
this fun part of you,

25:19.818 --> 25:20.519
this adventurous part of you.

25:20.986 --> 25:21.520
Yes.

25:22.387 --> 25:22.754
Knock 'em dead out there.

25:23.655 --> 25:24.256
- We will.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.258
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.760
Loosey, Mrs. Wallace,
come on over.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.795
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.765
So what drag name
have you worked on?

25:34.499 --> 25:35.634
I'm Lala LaDuca.

25:36.234 --> 25:37.402
[laughter]

25:38.136 --> 25:38.904
That's a great name.

25:39.504 --> 25:39.971
It's musical.

25:41.039 --> 25:41.239
And you have
a sketchbook there.

25:42.307 --> 25:43.608
Yes.
We're gonna have two dresses.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.344
Mine will be a little shorter,
hers will be a little longer.

25:47.412 --> 25:48.146
So I thought
that this fabric was

25:49.447 --> 25:51.616
so representative
of rich ladies at the beach.

25:52.517 --> 25:52.651
- Uh-huh.
- You know,

25:53.652 --> 25:53.885
- that kind of a vibe?
- Yeah.

25:55.153 --> 25:55.287
So she is not
old enough to be my mother.

25:56.221 --> 25:56.821
- We've established that.
- Yeah.

25:57.923 --> 25:59.658
- So cool aunt, slutty niece.
- Okay.

26:00.258 --> 26:01.293
[laughter]

26:02.694 --> 26:04.896
So now, Loosey, last week,
two of the contestants

26:06.064 --> 26:06.631
suggested that you should
go home.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.733
Yes.

26:09.768 --> 26:10.635
- What?
- What did that do

26:11.236 --> 26:11.870
to your psyche?

26:12.737 --> 26:13.972
Um, I didn't give a shit.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.542
What?

26:18.777 --> 26:21.413
I was surprised,
but I just took that in stride.

26:22.280 --> 26:22.747
I thought, you know what?

26:24.082 --> 26:25.984
Being angry about it
will not help me in any way.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.554
I think that Loosey is still
very hurt over the comments

26:30.422 --> 26:31.356
that I made on the main stage,

26:32.691 --> 26:34.759
and she kind of set me up
this week to fail.

26:35.493 --> 26:37.529
But it is what it is.

26:38.663 --> 26:40.532
And if you try
to screw me over,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.568
it will never end well.

26:44.669 --> 26:45.637
All right, ladies,
gather round.

26:46.504 --> 26:49.341
Now, tomorrow is draguation day

26:50.742 --> 26:53.578
as you make your drag family
debut on the main stage.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.648
Oh, and one more extra thing.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.985
Queens, you need to prepare
your draguates

27:00.719 --> 27:02.387
for their final exam.

27:03.254 --> 27:06.625
A Lip Sync For Your Life.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.460
Oh, my God.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.128
- Girl.
- Can you split?

27:10.729 --> 27:11.930
[laughter]

27:12.964 --> 27:15.066
Good luck,
and don't flunk it up.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.301
[laughter]

27:18.803 --> 27:21.072
[upbeat music]

27:21.940 --> 27:22.641
All right, Mrs. Wallace.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.111
So this is the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

27:26.578 --> 27:27.345
Wow.

27:28.513 --> 27:28.947
For this challenge,
all of our teachers

27:30.115 --> 27:31.950
are going to do
a lip sync battle.

27:33.351 --> 27:34.986
So now it's time to show
Auntie Lala how to properly

27:35.854 --> 27:37.856
lip sync for her LaDuca life.

27:38.857 --> 27:40.558
You can use
every bit of this stage.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.762
I like to do a slow walk thing
into a pose.

27:44.629 --> 27:45.664
And then when the beat drops,

27:46.965 --> 27:48.633
that's when you want to go
into your dance.

27:49.100 --> 27:49.834
Okay.

27:51.036 --> 27:51.936
I can see
that she's a little scared.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.973
And I let her know,
you gotta find that confidence

27:55.707 --> 27:56.675
because that is key.

27:57.409 --> 27:57.976
And if you don't got it,

27:59.110 --> 27:59.544
fake it 'till you make it, baby.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.781
What's an overexaggerated
version of this?

28:04.716 --> 28:07.318
Yes, ma'am!

28:08.353 --> 28:09.254
Oh, my God,
we're gonna kill this.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.290
A lot of girls will, like,
go really fast on the runway.

28:13.491 --> 28:13.625
I don't feel like
that's your vibe.

28:14.092 --> 28:14.893
No.

28:16.094 --> 28:16.494
Like, who's the biggest diva
that you love?

28:17.095 --> 28:18.396
Leiomy.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.099
[laughs]

28:21.833 --> 28:24.235
You know Leiomy?

28:25.503 --> 28:26.705
You know Leiomy?
Okay, give me Leiomy, then.

28:27.605 --> 28:28.740
Let's do Leiomy.
Mama is on it.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.675
There's no shaky start
for her.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.143
She don't look like no Bambi

28:33.344 --> 28:34.012
who just learned how to use
their legs.

28:35.180 --> 28:35.847
Give the audience
what they want,

28:36.981 --> 28:38.883
what they came for,
what they need, darling.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.553
You just want to really
embody the song, feel it.

28:42.487 --> 28:42.654
And if you don't
know the words,

28:43.521 --> 28:43.855
girl, just have a good time.

28:45.023 --> 28:45.156
- Interact with the judges.
- Okay.

28:46.191 --> 28:46.524
My style's
very Abby Lee Miller.

28:47.258 --> 28:47.726
I'm a strict bitch.

28:48.860 --> 28:49.360
Go slower.
You can go even slower, bitch.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.696
Tiptoe.
You're in a sickening gown.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.432
I would slap her on the hand
with a ruler if I had one.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.701
You're gonna slay
these bitches, period.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.069
I got this.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.405
And if you don't,
I'm giving you detention.

29:01.272 --> 29:02.540
Do you know how to duck walk?

29:03.174 --> 29:04.008
- No.
- Okay.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.146
So if you keep your butt down
and just kick up a leg.

29:08.913 --> 29:09.614
- Lower.
- I'm gonna die.

29:10.448 --> 29:10.715
[both laugh]
Okay.

29:11.316 --> 29:12.751
No, I can't.

29:13.885 --> 29:14.119
I don't think
that my daughter was

29:14.853 --> 29:15.720
gifted my same gifts.

29:16.321 --> 29:16.888
I can do this.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.257
And that's fine.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.926
Today's lesson is,

29:22.861 --> 29:23.995
drag queens are
like snowflakes.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.432
They're all different, and we
have to appreciate them all.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.668
Ahh!
[laughs]

29:31.770 --> 29:32.771
I just want to see you
feel out the song.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.039
Just have a good time
and just live in the moment.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.141
Okay.

29:36.741 --> 29:37.208
Hit it.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.310
[singing] Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

29:40.445 --> 29:40.645
What am I supposed to do?
[laughs]

29:41.513 --> 29:42.180
Just dance to the music.

29:42.914 --> 29:43.681
[singing] A champion

29:44.816 --> 29:46.151
Greatest of 'em all
[music slows to a stop]

29:47.919 --> 29:49.754
She looked like a deer
in headlights,

29:50.855 --> 29:51.823
but I'm trying
to stay optimistic.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.591
[singing] Champion

29:54.192 --> 29:56.127
Standing tall

29:57.295 --> 29:58.363
I definitely do have
my work cut out for me.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.232
We better make sure you're set
to defeat the competition

30:02.400 --> 30:03.334
how I've been doing
this entire time.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.504
We're not expecting her to be
Naomi Campbell on the runway.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.307
But at the end of the day,
my ass is on the line,

30:10.175 --> 30:10.942
so we gotta get this together.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.678
[singing] Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

30:16.915 --> 30:18.316
Here we go, runway day.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.952
Oh, wow.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.954
The girls are already girling.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.325
It is elimination day,
and this challenge is the one

30:28.726 --> 30:31.429
that is going to make or break
girls' top four placement.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.264
Say goodbye.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.867
Goodbye, face.
[both laugh]

30:37.168 --> 30:37.669
I think that everybody is
giving the vibe

30:38.703 --> 30:39.637
that they're going to do
a good job,

30:40.839 --> 30:41.539
but you never know
what can happen

30:42.941 --> 30:43.441
when you're working
with other people's faces

30:44.209 --> 30:44.542
for the first time.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.044
How bitchy
do you want your brow?

30:46.911 --> 30:48.580
Super bitch.
[laughs]

30:49.781 --> 30:51.683
I'm just so proud
that my daughter wants

30:52.884 --> 30:55.386
a resting bitch face
just like her mom.

30:56.554 --> 30:57.488
My drag is kind of bitchy,
I think,

30:58.623 --> 30:59.224
because also I'm not
really bitchy.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.291
Yeah.

31:01.259 --> 31:01.559
Because it's more fun,
you know?

31:02.227 --> 31:02.660
- Like...
- Yeah.

31:03.828 --> 31:04.229
Create something
that, you know,

31:05.096 --> 31:05.864
you can escape the world from.

31:06.331 --> 31:07.298
Yeah.

31:08.733 --> 31:08.867
I have younger brothers,
and I'm a little bit worried

31:10.268 --> 31:11.736
to, like, see, like, what
the world looks like for them

31:12.604 --> 31:13.538
when they're my age, you know?

31:14.906 --> 31:16.007
Do you think, like,
homophobia or transphobia,

31:17.408 --> 31:18.710
do you think that's something
that people could unlearn?

31:19.444 --> 31:19.777
Yeah, definitely.

31:20.645 --> 31:21.045
I think they can unlearn it.

31:22.113 --> 31:22.780
I think they just have
to be willing,

31:23.648 --> 31:24.415
and so that's the hard part.

31:25.617 --> 31:29.020
Kids don't really come
out of the womb hateful.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.521
It's something that they learn.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.425
So if we can, like, instill
love and kindness in kids now,

31:35.293 --> 31:36.227
it'll show up in our future.

31:37.095 --> 31:37.762
People don't really realize

31:38.963 --> 31:39.197
that we can learn so much
from kids.

31:39.664 --> 31:40.298
Yes.

31:41.499 --> 31:42.000
A lot of adults
just dismiss them,

31:43.368 --> 31:44.335
and so giving them, like,
just a few minutes

31:45.737 --> 31:46.838
just to talk about, like,
how they're feeling

31:48.273 --> 31:49.941
and name how they're feeling,
I think, goes a long way.

31:51.342 --> 31:51.910
If I had a teacher
like you when I was young,

31:53.211 --> 31:54.045
I feel like my life would be
a lot different.

31:54.545 --> 31:55.747
Aww.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.082
When did you say
you started drag?

31:59.217 --> 32:01.386
I started doing drag
four years ago.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.454
And did anyone give you
a hard time

32:04.322 --> 32:05.056
because you started doing this?

32:06.190 --> 32:07.125
I mean, my parents
at first were--

32:07.992 --> 32:08.626
like, they just didn't get it.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.295
And are they
really religious?

32:11.696 --> 32:12.597
'Cause it seems like people
who are really religious

32:13.731 --> 32:14.165
really don't tend to accept
as much.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.601
They aren't religious,
really, at all

32:18.069 --> 32:21.606
which was the surprising part
of why I got so much backlash.

32:23.007 --> 32:23.274
It was kind of always
when I was doing something

32:24.142 --> 32:25.743
a little, like, flamboyant.

32:27.178 --> 32:27.679
It would be like, "You're,
like, not gonna go to heaven

32:28.680 --> 32:29.213
if you, like, do things
like that."

32:30.581 --> 32:32.016
Or like, "God made Adam
and Eve, not Adam and Steve."

32:33.184 --> 32:35.053
It seems like they only
really took part in it

32:36.087 --> 32:37.822
when it was to use it
against me.

32:39.023 --> 32:39.557
That's why we kind of
stopped going to church.

32:40.525 --> 32:40.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I'm Catholic.

32:42.093 --> 32:42.927
- Yeah.
- And they're not accepting.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.329
It's like, you know what?

32:45.596 --> 32:46.130
If you can't accept
my children for who they are...

32:46.864 --> 32:47.231
That's really good.

32:48.566 --> 32:48.866
And I haven't gone back
because of that.

32:50.001 --> 32:50.668
So as I'm talking
to my teacher,

32:52.003 --> 32:53.671
I'm discovering that she has
a rainbow family.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.008
All of her kids are
some sort of queer person.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.211
I know a lot of parents,
especially people who are

33:01.312 --> 33:02.747
very religious,
they will put religion

33:04.048 --> 33:05.450
over everything,
even, like, the happiness

33:06.517 --> 33:07.652
or, like, the respect
of their kids.

33:08.252 --> 33:08.820
Oh, yeah.

33:09.821 --> 33:10.621
So, like,
I really can appreciate

33:11.589 --> 33:12.824
the fact that you said,
you know,

33:13.691 --> 33:14.158
"We're not gonna do this."

33:15.226 --> 33:16.594
Ms. Reyes is
just a lovely person

33:17.328 --> 33:17.895
with an amazing soul.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.598
She has an amazing energy,
and I'm happy

33:21.799 --> 33:23.267
that she is giving me
creative freedom here

33:24.669 --> 33:27.605
because I want her to enjoy
her first time in drag.

33:28.973 --> 33:29.407
How are you feeling
about performing and, like,

33:30.274 --> 33:31.009
being in front of the judges?

33:31.743 --> 33:32.744
Nervous, but excited.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.413
I would say, as my daughter,
you better shake it off.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.016
I am a little nervous
about the time restraints,

33:39.017 --> 33:40.151
but this is
right in my wheelhouse.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.619
I went to cosmetology school.

33:42.653 --> 33:43.388
I paint people backstage
for pageants,

33:44.789 --> 33:46.758
and I feel like I can
finally get my second win.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.860
So you guys are in the top.

33:49.727 --> 33:50.995
How many wins do you guys have?

33:52.063 --> 33:52.864
- I have two wins.
- Uh-huh.

33:53.998 --> 33:54.766
I've never been
in the bottom.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.868
Ooh. Okay.

33:57.835 --> 33:58.069
- And Loosey?
- Yes, baby?

33:58.970 --> 33:59.404
How many wins do you have?

34:00.471 --> 34:01.272
I have two
main challenge wins

34:02.140 --> 34:03.808
and three mini challenge wins.

34:04.275 --> 34:05.209
Ooh.

34:06.444 --> 34:07.311
I don't know
if mini challenges count.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.247
This will be my champion win,

34:10.415 --> 34:10.581
and this is the one
that matters the most,

34:11.315 --> 34:11.649
right before the end.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.385
So, bitch,
I've been consistent.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.721
That's what matters the most.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.357
Ooh, she looks
just like Loosey.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.560
I make eyes with Lala LaDuca,

34:23.428 --> 34:24.962
and she looks just like Loosey.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.999
Is that a good thing?
Who knows?

34:28.733 --> 34:31.002
You girls look good.

34:31.936 --> 34:32.236
Uh-huh.
[laughter]

34:33.404 --> 34:34.338
Did you practice
the song, Lala?

34:34.806 --> 34:36.274
Yes.

34:37.141 --> 34:37.975
Did you practice walking?

34:38.576 --> 34:39.310
Oh, wow.

34:40.178 --> 34:40.812
I got my comfy shoes on.

34:41.879 --> 34:42.346
- I think I got this.
- That part.

34:43.247 --> 34:44.015
Gather her.
[laughter]

34:45.450 --> 34:46.484
Has anyone been teaching
their daughters the lingo

34:47.618 --> 34:48.152
and what it means
to be in drag?

34:49.620 --> 34:50.121
She looked really fierce
when she put something on,

34:50.855 --> 34:51.255
and I went, "Bitch!"

34:52.123 --> 34:52.423
She looked very offended.

34:53.658 --> 34:53.825
I was like,
"No, that's a good thing."

34:55.093 --> 34:55.426
When I said
that Mistress looked like

34:56.561 --> 34:57.595
she models Alpo,
that was the truth,

34:58.329 --> 34:59.163
so that would be tea.

35:00.031 --> 35:00.965
But somebody could also say

35:02.133 --> 35:03.835
that I was reading her,
which is kind of like

35:04.569 --> 35:05.169
a playful little, like--

35:05.903 --> 35:06.771
No, shade is playful.

35:07.638 --> 35:08.506
Read is when you're going in.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.642
Shade is, "I don't have
to tell you you're ugly

35:12.677 --> 35:13.511
because you already know
you're ugly."

35:14.112 --> 35:14.846
[laughter]

35:16.147 --> 35:17.682
Now, Ms. Lala,
what did you do yesterday?

35:18.983 --> 35:20.751
When I won my walk-off,
I gathered her.

35:21.652 --> 35:22.253
- [laughter]
- Yeah.

35:23.254 --> 35:23.888
She said
in the mom community,

35:24.989 --> 35:25.957
"gather the girls"
means "put on your bra."

35:27.158 --> 35:27.425
- Gather the girls.
- Gather the girls.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.560
[laughter]

35:31.162 --> 35:33.164
Luxx's daughter,
Miss Asia Azul,

35:34.265 --> 35:36.000
she looks like the heads
on Easter Island.

35:36.734 --> 35:37.368
Mama looked pressed.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.670
She looks like--

35:40.138 --> 35:41.506
[laughs]

35:42.240 --> 35:43.040
I don't know, Luxxy.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.911
You are entering
your champion era.

35:47.512 --> 35:48.646
[drum roll]

35:50.047 --> 35:51.582
Oh.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.619
They're going to gag because
you look just like me, bitch.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.556
Madam Thang's face is
giving me full Disney villain.

35:59.290 --> 35:59.690
[dramatic musical sting]

36:00.424 --> 36:01.359
And you know what?

36:02.760 --> 36:05.129
I guess that does track
with Mistress's personality

36:06.264 --> 36:06.697
or whatever era
she's in right now.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.099
Ooh!

36:11.302 --> 36:14.272
[RuPaul's "Cover Girl"]

36:19.377 --> 36:22.079
[laughs]

36:24.282 --> 36:25.550
Cover girl

36:26.417 --> 36:27.752
Put the bass in your walk

36:28.753 --> 36:30.955
Head to toe,
let your whole body talk

36:31.556 --> 36:32.857
[applause]

36:33.457 --> 36:34.659
Yes, hot mama.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.261
Welcome
to Teacher Appreciation Week

36:37.995 --> 36:39.263
at "RuPaul's Drag Race."

36:40.131 --> 36:41.199
Now, for those of you watching,

36:42.567 --> 36:45.369
feel free to give a shout-out
to your favorite teacher

36:45.970 --> 36:47.605
using #dragrace.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.042
Michelle Visage,
who was your favorite teacher?

36:51.776 --> 36:52.176
This is so easy.

36:53.244 --> 36:54.278
My fourth grade teacher,
Mrs. Brunkwill,

36:55.746 --> 36:58.049
she taught me how to sing out
and sing with your diaphragm.

36:58.783 --> 36:59.450
And little did she know,

37:00.518 --> 37:01.352
I'd soon be needing
a diaphragm.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.087
[laughter]

37:03.955 --> 37:05.690
The sparkling Ross Matthews.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.258
Who was your favorite teacher?

37:08.693 --> 37:09.894
When I graduated high school
and was moving to Hollywood,

37:11.028 --> 37:11.929
my English teacher,
Cathy Clark Smith, said,

37:13.130 --> 37:13.397
"They're gonna think
you're a little fish

37:14.565 --> 37:15.499
"in a big pond,
but they're wrong.

37:16.667 --> 37:17.535
You're a big fish
in a big pond."

37:18.135 --> 37:19.470
[laughter]

37:20.471 --> 37:22.773
And I've been delusional
ever since.

37:24.108 --> 37:27.411
And "Celebrity Drag Race"
alum, Hayley Kiyoko.

37:28.279 --> 37:29.447
Who was your favorite teacher?

37:30.881 --> 37:32.450
My first grade teacher,
Ms. Spear, because I thought

37:33.317 --> 37:34.151
she was gonna be my wife.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.987
[laughter]

37:36.988 --> 37:37.989
This week,
we challenged our queens

37:39.223 --> 37:41.459
to transform
five hardworking teachers

37:42.059 --> 37:43.294
into glamazons.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.597
And tonight on the runway,
category is...

37:47.331 --> 37:49.267
drag family resemblance.

37:50.134 --> 37:51.302
Racers, start your engines.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.504
And may the best
drag queen win.

37:55.239 --> 37:59.710
[singing] The world
is your runway

38:00.845 --> 38:04.482
First up, Sasha Colby
and Ferocity Colby.

38:04.949 --> 38:05.916
Oh!

38:06.784 --> 38:07.318
Jennifer Convertibles called.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.888
They want their ass back.
[laughter]

38:12.023 --> 38:12.490
I'm beaming
like a proud mama.

38:13.691 --> 38:14.225
Ferocity looks great
with a big old rack,

38:14.825 --> 38:15.226
and that booty.

38:16.093 --> 38:16.961
Dolly Parton body, bitch.

38:18.229 --> 38:18.796
She knows she look great.
She loves it.

38:19.764 --> 38:20.865
The family resemblance
is there

38:21.932 --> 38:22.900
and she's soaking up
the judges.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.337
She is smiling at them.
She is presenting herself.

38:27.438 --> 38:28.739
Nobody can hold a candle
to Ferocity Colby.

38:29.874 --> 38:30.441
It shines bright.
It shines far.

38:31.542 --> 38:32.677
It's a what?
It's a superstar.

38:33.544 --> 38:36.314
All Ferocity, all shade.

38:36.914 --> 38:37.615
Oh, my gosh.

38:38.683 --> 38:40.551
They're graduating
with a BFA,

38:41.152 --> 38:41.886
Big Fat Ass.

38:42.753 --> 38:43.888
Hey!
[laughter]

38:44.822 --> 38:47.391
Loosey LaDuca
and Lala LaDuca.

38:48.526 --> 38:51.228
Oh, "Barb and Star Go
to Vista Del Mar."

38:52.430 --> 38:55.032
It feels so incredible
to walk down this runway

38:56.167 --> 38:57.835
with my little drag baby, Lala.

38:58.969 --> 39:02.106
She is giving LaDuca
family resemblance down.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.075
It's a little weird

39:05.142 --> 39:07.111
because I swear
I am looking at myself.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.282
She's got big blonde hair,
big boobs, tiny waist.

39:11.882 --> 39:12.616
She is serving

39:13.751 --> 39:16.854
"I'm the only bitch
on this runway, RuPaul."

39:17.855 --> 39:19.423
Girls' trip to Boca.
Who's in?

39:20.024 --> 39:20.958
[laughter]

39:21.826 --> 39:23.461
I'll see you in detention.

39:25.529 --> 39:29.333
Mistress Isabelle Brooks
and Madam Thang.

39:30.201 --> 39:30.901
- Ooh.
- Mmm-mmm.

39:31.635 --> 39:32.403
Take my breath away.

39:33.571 --> 39:34.472
Now this is a class
that I want to take.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.708
Yeah, why don't you come up
and teach me sometime?

39:38.309 --> 39:39.176
Ow, ow, ow.

39:40.344 --> 39:40.644
We're shimmying
down the runway.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.714
We have these huge tulle boas
and big hair.

39:44.448 --> 39:45.616
Our mug is snatched.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.685
Baby, we look glamorous,
we look plump,

39:49.019 --> 39:50.154
and we're everything you could
ever want in a woman.

39:51.288 --> 39:52.456
Okay?
Madam Thang is feeling it.

39:53.524 --> 39:54.358
This bitch is
stealing my spotlight.

39:55.659 --> 39:58.028
The judges are all in her mug
and she is flawless.

39:59.163 --> 39:59.296
Being up here
with Madam Thang,

40:00.164 --> 40:01.499
I am so happy and I'm so proud

40:02.600 --> 40:03.067
because she's living
in the moment

40:04.468 --> 40:05.703
and having fun, and that's
making this experience

40:06.771 --> 40:07.605
so enjoyable
for the both of us.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.040
They're from the best
little schoolhouse in Texas.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.209
[laughter]

40:13.344 --> 40:16.080
That's Madam Thang
if you're nasty.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.017
Oh, and the train is
definitely still running.

40:20.951 --> 40:21.485
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, hey.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.587
The teacher's lounge
is lit after 6:00.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.824
[laughter]

40:27.958 --> 40:31.028
Luxx Noir London
and Asia Azul.

40:32.396 --> 40:33.998
Asia makes me want to eat
a hot dog real bad.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.733
[laughter]

40:36.634 --> 40:37.501
If Ms. Reyes is the teacher,

40:38.669 --> 40:41.038
Asia Azul is definitely
the one in detention

40:42.473 --> 40:44.809
because she is giving you
this sexy blonde hair moment.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.278
It's so bad, yet so good.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.648
Asia is wearing
a gorgeous mermaid gown

40:51.816 --> 40:54.118
that I have made myself,
thank you very much.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.921
It has
a gorgeous matching cape

40:58.122 --> 41:00.424
with a peach lining
that matches my dress.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.494
Classic Luxx, classic beauty.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.397
Asia is just having
a really good time up there.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.232
Ugh, she just looks
so stunning.

41:09.099 --> 41:09.633
See you at the White Lotus.

41:10.234 --> 41:12.203
[laughter]

41:12.937 --> 41:15.272
Anetra and Alektra.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.107
- Hey!
- Oh.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.044
Anetra, now available
in a travel size.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.612
[laughter]

41:22.947 --> 41:24.348
Me and Alektra are
giving you the yin and yang.

41:25.216 --> 41:26.050
We are the yin-yang twins.

41:27.184 --> 41:28.352
I definitely wanted
to lean into Asian pride

41:29.820 --> 41:32.056
with this Mandarin collar,
the sashes off of the arm

41:32.790 --> 41:33.624
onto the shoulder.

41:34.792 --> 41:35.125
And we're giving
the opposite side

41:35.993 --> 41:36.460
because we are giving what?

41:37.194 --> 41:38.262
Balance in the outfit.

41:39.196 --> 41:39.897
Because as we've
learned before,

41:41.298 --> 41:42.500
just a bodysuit on "Drag Race"
will not get you anywhere.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.535
Alektra is definitely
feeling her oats.

41:45.669 --> 41:46.637
It's like as if
she took out each oat

41:47.538 --> 41:48.572
and felt them individually.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.342
I am a proud drag mother.

41:51.976 --> 41:52.743
My duckling.

41:53.944 --> 41:56.080
Does this one leg
make my ass look fat?

41:56.847 --> 41:57.548
Actually, it does.

41:58.182 --> 41:58.749
Ooh, yay.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.285
[laughter]

42:02.553 --> 42:04.421
Welcome, queens.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.626
You all look
too cool for school.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.828
Absolutely gorgeous.

42:12.096 --> 42:13.631
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.100
First up, Sasha Colby.

42:16.967 --> 42:19.537
And this is Ferocity Colby.

42:20.404 --> 42:20.738
You two are such family,

42:21.872 --> 42:22.006
you're gonna fight
at Christmas.

42:22.606 --> 42:23.307
[laughter]

42:24.408 --> 42:25.009
And you did it
in such smart ways.

42:25.743 --> 42:26.544
Not just the material

42:27.645 --> 42:29.113
and the cutouts
mirroring each other,

42:30.147 --> 42:31.348
but also the proportion
of the padding

42:32.082 --> 42:32.583
is very similar as well.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.286
Like you came out
the same womb.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.955
Your synergy
on stage was connected.

42:38.689 --> 42:39.456
You felt very present.

42:40.591 --> 42:41.358
And that's sometimes
what it's about,

42:42.693 --> 42:43.627
more so than just looking
like one another.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.698
There has to be a chemistry,
and you kids really had it.

42:49.099 --> 42:50.367
Now, we're all used to
padding and things like that.

42:51.535 --> 42:53.571
What's it like for you
to pad like that?

42:54.338 --> 42:55.072
Oh, I'm loving it.

42:55.839 --> 42:56.440
I've never had these.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.342
[laughter]

42:59.109 --> 43:02.212
I am enjoying them.

43:02.947 --> 43:05.049
Up next, Loosey LaDuca

43:05.649 --> 43:07.318
and Lala LaDuca.

43:08.519 --> 43:09.753
[with New York accent]
Loosey and Lala LaDuca.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.722
[laughter]

43:12.856 --> 43:14.558
I thought you kids did
a really cute job

43:15.292 --> 43:16.327
in family resemblance.

43:17.494 --> 43:17.928
What could have been
a little bit stronger

43:18.796 --> 43:19.763
was the fun on the stage.

43:21.231 --> 43:22.066
I felt like you were both
doing something separate,

43:23.133 --> 43:23.801
and you needed
to have that chemistry

43:24.535 --> 43:24.835
to keep you together.

43:25.703 --> 43:27.605
I disagree with Michelle.

43:28.339 --> 43:29.640
Lala, I loved your walk.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.543
There was just so much pride
and, like, excitement

43:33.978 --> 43:34.645
that was oozing out of you,
and I felt the connection

43:35.245 --> 43:36.113
between you two.

43:37.581 --> 43:38.148
The thing is, about this
stage in the competition,

43:39.316 --> 43:40.618
is it's seriously down
to splitting hairs.

43:41.218 --> 43:42.019
Like, the shoes.

43:43.354 --> 43:43.487
If you just would have
stoned them just a little bit

43:44.688 --> 43:45.122
to make me go,
"Oh, yeah, they're the same."

43:45.990 --> 43:46.390
I know it sounds so stupid,

43:47.524 --> 43:49.293
but that's where we are
in this competition.

43:50.327 --> 43:52.830
Lala, so beautiful,
my goodness.

43:53.964 --> 43:54.798
Have you ever worn
makeup before?

43:55.666 --> 43:57.401
Not like this.
[laughter]

43:58.869 --> 44:00.571
Is there anything you wanted
to do but didn't have time?

44:01.939 --> 44:03.240
I really would have liked
to stone on the shoe.

44:04.642 --> 44:05.109
I think it would have brought
the whole thing together.

44:05.709 --> 44:07.845
[laughter]

44:08.812 --> 44:11.682
Up next,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks

44:12.282 --> 44:14.284
and Madam Thang.

44:15.152 --> 44:17.388
You two were a joy to watch.

44:18.555 --> 44:20.324
You had chemistry.
You had connection.

44:21.058 --> 44:21.725
You had choreography.

44:23.127 --> 44:25.295
It was the very best wicked,
wild world of Mae West.

44:26.363 --> 44:27.931
Madam Thang gave me
the attitude.

44:28.666 --> 44:28.932
I was getting the eyes.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.167
I was like, "Ooh!"

44:31.201 --> 44:31.402
It was like,
"You're looking at me?

44:32.136 --> 44:32.670
Good, keep looking."

44:33.771 --> 44:35.906
But my favorite part
is how you left,

44:37.341 --> 44:40.077
because you thought about
every detail, even the exit.

44:41.145 --> 44:42.513
So not for one moment
did I not buy

44:43.580 --> 44:44.748
that you are
absolutely related.

44:45.349 --> 44:45.916
Thank you.

44:46.784 --> 44:48.018
You two are something else.

44:48.886 --> 44:50.788
Tell me about this process.

44:52.189 --> 44:53.791
I did try to pay her off
to shave her eyebrows.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.093
At first, I asked very nicely.

44:56.827 --> 44:58.228
Then I offered her $500.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.064
[laughter]

45:01.098 --> 45:01.231
What were you thinking
when you were

45:01.965 --> 45:02.299
walking down the runway?

45:03.033 --> 45:03.867
Making Mistress proud.

45:04.802 --> 45:05.536
- Aww.
- I did threaten her.

45:06.403 --> 45:06.870
- [laughter]
- You didn't.

45:07.471 --> 45:08.038
Thank you.

45:08.906 --> 45:11.375
Up next, Luxx Noir London.

45:12.109 --> 45:14.845
And this is Asia Azul.

45:15.713 --> 45:15.846
[laughter]
Okay.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.348
Work it, miss thang.

45:19.216 --> 45:20.050
Luxx, Jennifer Coolidge.

45:21.118 --> 45:22.052
Great to see you.
[laughter]

45:22.920 --> 45:25.322
Asia, you look so stunning.

45:26.757 --> 45:29.326
Luxx, what you did with this
makeover is unbelievable.

45:29.927 --> 45:30.728
How do you feel?

45:31.595 --> 45:32.329
I feel like my Tía Lala.

45:33.764 --> 45:34.364
She used to dress like this
because she was so glamorous.

45:35.799 --> 45:37.367
Asia, I was on "Celebrity
Drag Race," and I remember

45:38.435 --> 45:40.804
I was terrified to go
on the stage,

45:41.672 --> 45:43.407
and I could feel your nerves

45:44.608 --> 45:45.442
when you first walked out,
and I saw

45:46.543 --> 45:47.444
this transformation,
like, mid-walk

45:48.445 --> 45:49.012
where you just, like,
let loose.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.547
Performance, fantastic.

45:51.615 --> 45:52.549
I think what happened
for me is that

45:53.417 --> 45:54.218
there's no family resemblance.

45:55.152 --> 45:55.519
I think
what you're trying to do

45:56.687 --> 45:57.721
is tie in the blue
with your eyeshadow,

45:58.589 --> 45:59.256
and that really didn't work.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.059
The hair style, the hair color,
the color palette.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.129
Coral ties it in,
but it's so opposite, Luxx,

46:06.096 --> 46:08.532
that I see
zero family resemblance.

46:09.399 --> 46:10.067
What's your favorite part?

46:11.201 --> 46:12.369
That I get to twirl
and I have a cape.

46:12.970 --> 46:15.239
[laughter]

46:16.373 --> 46:17.674
We're seeing
Jennifer Coolidge.

46:18.408 --> 46:18.909
Are you seeing that?

46:19.777 --> 46:21.278
I don't know who she is.

46:22.379 --> 46:22.679
I'm sorry, guys,
I don't know who she is.

46:23.280 --> 46:23.914
Gay gasp.

46:25.015 --> 46:25.215
We'll go home
and watch some movies.

46:26.116 --> 46:26.250
- It's fine.
- Okay.

46:26.850 --> 46:28.218
[laughter]

46:28.952 --> 46:30.087
Up next, Anetra.

46:30.821 --> 46:33.457
And this is Alektra.

46:34.625 --> 46:35.392
Listen, Barbie and Skipper,
I loved it.

46:36.226 --> 46:37.394
- [laughter]
- Yeah, totally.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.531
This family resemblance,
this is a no-brainer.

46:41.398 --> 46:42.833
That one leg is everything.

46:43.567 --> 46:44.468
It's super elevated.

46:45.335 --> 46:46.503
I love that you have the--

46:47.571 --> 46:47.738
I don't know
what this piece is--

46:48.605 --> 46:49.139
I guess the arm foreskin.

46:50.007 --> 46:50.474
What would you call that?

46:51.875 --> 46:53.210
Whatever that is, I love
that yours is pink, Anetra,

46:54.077 --> 46:54.378
and, Alektra, yours is black.

46:55.512 --> 46:55.646
Because they can't
be identical.

46:56.814 --> 46:57.214
They have to be a little
different but related.

46:58.382 --> 46:59.650
That is the essence
of this challenge.

47:01.051 --> 47:03.187
Your presentation was just
so polished and refined.

47:04.388 --> 47:05.522
The way you choreographed it
was different

47:06.690 --> 47:08.192
to everybody else,
and I love that.

47:08.926 --> 47:09.760
It just made sense.

47:11.094 --> 47:11.695
Tell me, what's your
favorite part of this outfit?

47:12.429 --> 47:14.331
Um, this arm foreskin.

47:14.932 --> 47:16.567
[laughter]

47:17.467 --> 47:18.635
- Trend alert.
- #armforeskin.

47:19.503 --> 47:20.637
- [laughter]
- Yes.

47:21.905 --> 47:23.073
Anetra, what did you learn
from Alektra?

47:24.441 --> 47:26.176
She's so open about
queerness in the classroom.

47:27.277 --> 47:28.111
And it was nice
and refreshing to hear

47:29.413 --> 47:31.481
how simple it is
for, like, kindergartners

47:32.583 --> 47:33.750
to understand, like,
love is love.

47:34.218 --> 47:34.918
Yeah.

47:36.119 --> 47:36.954
The concepts are
not hard to learn,

47:38.422 --> 47:40.591
because they naturally have
that empathy and that love.

47:41.925 --> 47:43.293
And so just tapping
into that magic and that joy

47:43.894 --> 47:44.828
that they have.

47:45.562 --> 47:46.396
All right, thank you.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.199
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

47:49.933 --> 47:52.069
But before you leave,

47:53.203 --> 47:54.905
I want to see
our teacher queens

47:55.639 --> 47:57.274
do one more thing.

47:58.008 --> 47:59.543
[laughs maniacally]

48:00.010 --> 48:00.544
Oh.

48:02.412 --> 48:05.682
Five beautiful queens
stand before me.

48:06.817 --> 48:07.751
Prior to tonight,
you were asked

48:08.752 --> 48:10.254
to prepare
a lip sync performance

48:10.988 --> 48:12.456
of my song, "Champion."

48:13.323 --> 48:14.591
I dedicate this performance

48:15.659 --> 48:17.761
to all the educators everywhere.

48:18.362 --> 48:19.663
[dramatic music]

48:20.764 --> 48:21.531
The time has come...
[thunderclap]

48:22.266 --> 48:24.334
For you to lip-sync

48:24.935 --> 48:27.771
for your life.

48:30.374 --> 48:31.642
Let's go, girls.

48:32.676 --> 48:36.513
Good luck,
and don't flunk it up.

48:37.114 --> 48:38.682
[laughter]

48:39.549 --> 48:40.584
They try to keep you down

48:41.418 --> 48:42.119
- Yes!
- Yes, mama!

48:43.287 --> 48:44.521
[singing] But
there's no denying

48:45.255 --> 48:46.290
You're a champion

48:46.757 --> 48:47.391
Yes!

48:48.258 --> 48:48.892
[singing] Greatest of them all

48:49.626 --> 48:50.928
You're a champion

48:51.528 --> 48:52.462
Never gonna fall

48:53.196 --> 48:54.298
You're a champion

48:55.365 --> 48:55.532
- Still standing tall
- Beautiful.

48:56.600 --> 48:56.967
- Yes!
- [singing] You're a champion

48:57.834 --> 48:58.468
Yeah, that's my daughter!

48:59.636 --> 49:00.304
[singing] You'll
always be a hero

49:01.438 --> 49:02.739
- And when your story's told
- Yes.

49:03.874 --> 49:04.308
Yes. - [singing]
When the truth unfolds

49:05.175 --> 49:05.909
Oh!
[laughter]

49:07.244 --> 49:08.111
[singing] They will sing
your praises loud

49:09.479 --> 49:10.314
'Cause your story's gold,
if the truth be told

49:11.348 --> 49:12.416
- Come on, bitch!
- Yeah!

49:13.617 --> 49:13.750
[singing] With all
the children singing

49:14.351 --> 49:14.985
Clap, hos!

49:16.019 --> 49:16.620
[singing] Oh, oh, oh,
oh-oh, oh, oh

49:17.521 --> 49:18.822
Yeah!
[laughter]

49:19.423 --> 49:22.459
[all cheering]

49:23.327 --> 49:25.896
Yes, honey!
[laughter]

49:26.763 --> 49:29.366
[singing] Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

49:30.534 --> 49:33.036
You're a champion,
greatest of them all

49:34.137 --> 49:35.138
- You're a champion
- Yes, girl!

49:36.006 --> 49:36.773
[singing] Never gonna fall

49:37.841 --> 49:38.675
- You're a champion
- Work it!

49:39.710 --> 49:40.410
- Yes!
- [singing] Still standing tall

49:41.712 --> 49:44.614
You're a champion,
and you'll always be a hero

49:45.615 --> 49:49.619
[cheers and applause]

49:50.387 --> 49:51.355
- Yes!
- Come on, baby.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.156
Yes!

49:53.623 --> 49:55.025
Wow.

49:56.026 --> 49:57.561
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

49:58.161 --> 49:59.396
[dramatic music]

50:00.330 --> 50:02.165
Shantay,
you all get straight As.

50:03.033 --> 50:04.801
- [applause]
- Yes.

50:05.902 --> 50:07.437
Oh, what the heck.
You all get gay A's too.

50:08.038 --> 50:09.706
[all cheering]

50:10.707 --> 50:12.609
Now, while you untuck backstage,

50:13.543 --> 50:16.246
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:17.414 --> 50:19.516
Now, just between
us faculty members,

50:20.384 --> 50:21.685
I want to know what you think.

50:22.552 --> 50:23.420
Starting with Sasha Colby.

50:23.887 --> 50:24.721
Bam.

50:25.889 --> 50:26.656
Drag family resemblance
slapped in your face.

50:27.991 --> 50:28.358
I love the fact
that they padded for this.

50:29.426 --> 50:30.627
- Yes.
- Because they didn't have to.

50:31.094 --> 50:31.828
No.

50:32.863 --> 50:33.497
But that was
the family resemblance.

50:34.831 --> 50:35.866
I think Ferocity
looked like she does this

50:37.200 --> 50:38.635
every single day,
and I think Sasha killed it

50:39.536 --> 50:41.438
from being a supportive mentor

50:42.339 --> 50:43.907
to really expanding her family.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.409
Loosey LaDuca.

50:46.843 --> 50:47.844
So, Hayley, earlier you were
saying that you disagreed.

50:48.945 --> 50:49.846
It wasn't about
the choreography for me.

50:50.981 --> 50:51.648
It was purely about
the chemistry.

50:52.549 --> 50:53.650
I don't know if Lala was afraid

50:54.751 --> 50:56.820
or Loosey was, you know,
afraid for Lala.

50:58.188 --> 50:59.689
It just lacked the chemistry
that you really need

51:01.091 --> 51:03.627
on the main stage when selling
this particular challenge.

51:04.795 --> 51:05.929
My issue was just
with the details.

51:06.797 --> 51:07.264
That shoe should be burned.

51:08.198 --> 51:08.865
It just doesn't
belong anywhere.

51:10.067 --> 51:10.500
- Her feet were small.
- Her feet were small,

51:11.835 --> 51:12.803
but that heel was
about 2 centimeters tall.

51:14.237 --> 51:14.938
Did she do a good job?
Yeah, she did a good job.

51:16.239 --> 51:18.041
But, you know, some
of the other girls did better.

51:18.909 --> 51:19.976
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

51:20.844 --> 51:21.511
It was just very effortless.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.082
I loved watching them together,
and I didn't want it to end.

51:25.682 --> 51:26.683
She was smart.

51:28.151 --> 51:29.853
She did what she does best,
which is this pageant thing,

51:30.720 --> 51:31.755
and she kept it simple, stupid.

51:32.689 --> 51:33.557
And it ended up
being wonderful.

51:34.791 --> 51:36.326
I also love
that she offered to pay her

51:37.327 --> 51:37.761
500 bucks
to shave her eyebrows.

51:38.495 --> 51:39.229
[laughs] - Yes.

51:40.630 --> 51:41.098
Michelle, I'll give you 50
if you shave your back.

51:41.698 --> 51:42.766
[laughter]

51:43.667 --> 51:44.568
You could have had me at 20.

51:45.202 --> 51:47.337
[laughter]

51:48.105 --> 51:48.705
Luxx Noir London.

51:49.940 --> 51:50.373
I thought Asia looked
like Jennifer Coolidge,

51:51.007 --> 51:51.808
because she did.

51:52.976 --> 51:53.443
But when it comes
to family resemblance,

51:54.644 --> 51:55.045
they just weren't
"Best in Show."

51:55.679 --> 51:57.013
[laughter]

51:58.482 --> 52:00.183
Luxx's outfit was a series
of three pieces of fabric

52:01.051 --> 52:02.285
in approximately five knots.

52:02.886 --> 52:03.553
[laughter]

52:04.688 --> 52:06.389
She could have taken
that blue fabric

52:07.424 --> 52:08.859
- and done the same knotted look.
- Yes.

52:09.993 --> 52:10.660
And that is all
they would have needed

52:11.628 --> 52:12.429
to tie in
the family resemblance.

52:13.430 --> 52:13.964
I was very impressed
with Asia

52:15.132 --> 52:15.832
because she was
obviously nervous,

52:17.267 --> 52:19.236
so I do want to give points
that Luxx was able to be there

52:19.836 --> 52:20.604
and support her.

52:21.905 --> 52:23.640
But unfortunately,
that wasn't the assignment.

52:24.808 --> 52:25.775
- Anetra.
- We've heard queens before

52:27.043 --> 52:27.644
in this family resemblance
challenge say,

52:28.812 --> 52:29.479
"Oh, it's so tough
because physically,

52:30.213 --> 52:30.947
we're so different."

52:31.848 --> 52:32.315
- Bullshit.
- Right.

52:33.183 --> 52:33.583
They looked like sisters.

52:34.718 --> 52:36.553
I'm so impressed
that she hand-stitched

52:37.988 --> 52:40.524
and made those outfits,
and they looked identical

52:41.391 --> 52:43.460
but also had their own life.

52:44.561 --> 52:45.996
I couldn't take
my eyes off of Alektra.

52:47.164 --> 52:48.899
Anetra painted her
so beautifully.

52:50.100 --> 52:50.700
And, of course,
the trend alert.

52:51.334 --> 52:52.836
Uncut sleeve.

52:53.737 --> 52:54.638
Finally, bringing uncut back.

52:55.272 --> 52:57.007
[laughter]

52:57.641 --> 52:58.575
Silence.

52:59.309 --> 53:00.043
I've made my decision.

53:00.777 --> 53:02.712
Bring back my girls.

53:03.446 --> 53:03.780
Welcome back, queens.

53:04.648 --> 53:06.116
[squeals] - Oh, my God. Okay.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.618
Made some decisions.

53:09.486 --> 53:10.921
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

53:12.322 --> 53:15.325
Tonight, you understood
the assignment, miss thang.

53:16.226 --> 53:17.861
- You are safe.
- Thank you.

53:18.728 --> 53:19.629
- [applause]
- Yes!

53:20.363 --> 53:22.165
Sasha Colby, tonight,

53:22.766 --> 53:24.968
you got all A's

53:25.835 --> 53:26.903
and a pair of double D's.

53:27.504 --> 53:28.939
[laughter]

53:29.839 --> 53:31.141
- You are safe.
- Thank you.

53:31.608 --> 53:32.175
Aww.

53:32.776 --> 53:35.912
[dramatic music]

53:36.513 --> 53:37.681
Anetra.

53:38.815 --> 53:41.851
Tonight, you were
the head of the class.

53:42.452 --> 53:42.986
Condragulations.

53:44.154 --> 53:44.588
You're the winner
of this week's show.

53:45.455 --> 53:46.623
[squeals] - Oh, my God!

53:47.824 --> 53:50.527
You won a cash prize
of $5,000 for yourself

53:51.394 --> 53:53.964
and a cash prize of $5,000

53:54.831 --> 53:55.699
for your teacher, Alektra.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.336
[screams] [all cheering]

54:00.203 --> 54:01.004
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

54:02.372 --> 54:04.541
And to show our appreciation
to all of our teachers,

54:05.642 --> 54:07.911
each of you will receive
a three-night stay

54:09.212 --> 54:11.715
at Ace Hotel and Swim Club
in Palm Springs.

54:12.315 --> 54:14.884
[all cheering]

54:16.019 --> 54:17.020
Anetra, you may join
the other girls.

54:17.921 --> 54:18.989
Thank you.
[screams]

54:20.090 --> 54:21.291
Two challenge wins,
back-to-back.

54:22.626 --> 54:23.793
It's gonna be a good Christmas
for everybody, y'all.

54:26.596 --> 54:29.599
Loosey LaDuca,
Luxx Noir London.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.703
I'm sorry my dears, but you are
both up for elimination.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.073
Okay.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.610
I'm shocked
to be in the bottom.

54:41.778 --> 54:43.813
I am angry,
but I'm ignoring that for now

54:44.848 --> 54:48.151
because I am going to be
in the finale.

54:50.720 --> 54:53.757
Two queens stand before me.

54:55.091 --> 54:56.092
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

54:57.227 --> 55:00.263
a lip sync performance
of "For the Girls"

55:00.997 --> 55:02.666
by Hayley Kiyoko.

55:03.867 --> 55:06.202
Ladies, this is
your last chance to impress me.

55:07.070 --> 55:10.173
Save yourself from elimination.

55:12.275 --> 55:14.477
The time has come...
[thunderclap]

55:15.078 --> 55:17.147
To lip-sync

55:17.747 --> 55:20.650
for your life.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.455
Come on, Loosey.

55:26.356 --> 55:27.757
Come on, Luxx.
You got this.

55:28.892 --> 55:30.760
For the first time
in "Drag Race" herstory,

55:32.028 --> 55:34.531
Luxx Noir London has fallen
into the bottom.

55:35.932 --> 55:38.601
So, bitch, I am ready
to give the judges a show

55:39.469 --> 55:40.603
like they have not seen before,

55:41.705 --> 55:43.606
and I am ready
to send Loosey home.

55:44.641 --> 55:48.478
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

55:49.412 --> 55:50.213
[Hayley Kiyoko's
"For the Girls"]

55:51.281 --> 55:52.148
- Come on.
- Come on, girls.

55:53.416 --> 55:55.652
[singing] 10 out of 10,
all in a line

55:56.753 --> 55:58.455
The air's sweet
when we're passing by

55:59.055 --> 55:59.723
Yeah, ooh

56:00.724 --> 56:01.124
- It hurts a little
- Yes!

56:01.991 --> 56:02.826
[singing] Don't get whiplash

56:03.560 --> 56:05.962
Don't forget that

56:06.696 --> 56:09.632
Save a kiss for the sun

56:10.700 --> 56:13.103
Don't you wish
you could come undone?

56:13.837 --> 56:16.706
Take a dip, join the fun

56:18.108 --> 56:21.711
Just as long as you know
that summer's for the girls

56:23.146 --> 56:25.148
The girls that like girls,
the girls that like boys

56:26.182 --> 56:27.050
The girls,
the girls, the girls

56:28.184 --> 56:29.753
Summer's for the girls
that run the night

56:30.820 --> 56:31.554
Girls that change
your life

56:32.722 --> 56:34.057
Girls, the girls,
the girls, the girls

56:34.524 --> 56:36.726
Ooh

56:37.327 --> 56:38.027
Don't wipe out

56:39.028 --> 56:39.996
One look
and it's lights out

56:40.864 --> 56:43.633
What's everyone gonna do?

56:44.234 --> 56:44.934
Let's find out

56:45.835 --> 56:46.870
It's not wrong,
it's right now

56:47.470 --> 56:49.906
[all cheering]

56:51.341 --> 56:53.143
Summer's for the girls,
the girls that like girls

56:53.877 --> 56:54.844
The girls that like boys

56:55.879 --> 56:56.613

Girls, the girls,
the girls, the girls

57:04.454 --> 57:07.557
Take a dip, join the fun

57:08.291 --> 57:11.327
Just as long as you know

57:11.928 --> 57:12.629
Come on, girl!

57:13.797 --> 57:13.930
[singing] Girls
that like girls

57:14.664 --> 57:15.732
The girls that like boys

57:16.766 --> 57:17.667
The girls,
the girls, the girls

57:19.002 --> 57:20.904
Surround me with the girls,
I love being a girl

57:21.838 --> 57:24.107
I'm ready for the girls,
are you?

57:25.442 --> 57:27.644
Surround me with the girls,
I love being a girl

57:28.578 --> 57:29.746
I'm ready for the girls,
are you?

57:35.018 --> 57:36.619
Yeah!

57:37.353 --> 57:39.055
That was beautiful.

57:39.522 --> 57:41.124
Whoo!

57:42.125 --> 57:43.393
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

57:43.993 --> 57:46.429
[dramatic music]

57:47.831 --> 57:49.833
Ooh, I can't take this.

57:51.668 --> 57:55.371
Luxx Noir London,
shantay, you stay.

57:56.239 --> 57:57.307
- Yay!
- Oh, yes.

57:58.041 --> 57:58.842
Thank you so much.

57:59.709 --> 58:00.443
You may join the other girls.

58:04.314 --> 58:07.417

58:08.017 --> 58:10.920
LaDiva LaDuca.

58:11.988 --> 58:12.822
- You're a star, baby.
- Thank you.

58:13.556 --> 58:15.692
Now sashay away.

58:16.426 --> 58:17.193
Thank you all so much.

58:17.794 --> 58:20.563
[soft music]

58:21.164 --> 58:24.300
[applause]

58:25.568 --> 58:27.203
Just make sure to tell them

58:28.271 --> 58:29.172
I wasn't just
a great set of boobs.

58:29.772 --> 58:30.206
[laughter]

58:31.374 --> 58:32.909
I'm also
an incredible set of legs.

58:33.776 --> 58:35.912
- [laughter]
- Yes!

58:39.415 --> 58:43.353
I feel...

58:44.087 --> 58:45.855
a little slighted.

58:46.589 --> 58:48.391
I have always delivered,

58:49.492 --> 58:51.861
and I deserve to be
in the finale.

58:52.729 --> 58:53.830
I'm trying not to be angry

58:54.998 --> 58:56.199
that the other girls
get to experience

58:57.200 --> 59:00.069
the rest of this journey
and I don't.

59:01.437 --> 59:02.705
I shouldn't have been in
the bottom of this challenge.

59:03.439 --> 59:04.374
I executed everything.

59:05.542 --> 59:08.177
Mistress put her girl
in a stretch dress.

59:09.045 --> 59:11.114
I know that I'm a superstar,

59:12.549 --> 59:14.984
and I think that I'm one
of the most unique people

59:15.718 --> 59:16.686
in this competition.

59:19.155 --> 59:20.990
I can't say the same
for everyone.

59:24.594 --> 59:27.664
Condragulations,
my top four queens.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.667
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:31.968 --> 59:32.936
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?

59:33.803 --> 59:35.038
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:35.638 --> 59:36.639
all: Amen.

59:37.373 --> 59:38.207
Let the music play.

59:39.375 --> 59:42.879
A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

59:44.013 --> 59:45.381
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

59:46.115 --> 59:47.850
Can you feel the love?

59:50.887 --> 59:52.722
Next time
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

59:53.856 --> 59:56.626
You'll be starring
in the season 15 remix

59:57.627 --> 59:58.695
of my song,
"Blame It on the Edit."

59:59.162 --> 1:00:00.763
Ooh!

1:00:02.031 --> 1:00:02.298
I want this
more than I've ever wanted

1:00:03.032 --> 1:00:03.700
anything in my life.

1:00:04.567 --> 1:00:06.135
I need to be in the finale.

1:00:07.303 --> 1:00:09.639
All that's left for me to win
is the crown.

1:00:10.807 --> 1:00:12.141
But remember,
only three of you

1:00:13.309 --> 1:00:15.645
will be going through
to the grand finale.

1:00:16.379 --> 1:00:17.547
Somebody gotta go.

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:19.649
Baby, all it takes
is one slipup,

1:00:20.383 --> 1:00:20.883
and then you are gone.

1:00:21.484 --> 1:00:23.920
[dramatic music]

1:00:25.488 --> 1:00:30.293
[singing] A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

1:00:31.427 --> 1:00:33.129
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:38.134
A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

1:00:39.268 --> 1:00:40.570
Turn it around
when you up and say

1:00:41.504 --> 1:00:43.439
Everybody say
love, love, love

1:00:44.207 --> 1:00:46.376
Love, oh, love, love

1:00:47.276 --> 1:00:50.780
Love, love, love, oh, love

1:00:51.547 --> 1:00:52.849
Can you feel the love?
