VERNON (V.O)
Previously on Still the King...

00:03.533 --> 00:05.067
You want me to stay
the preacher here?

00:05.167 --> 00:07.333
If it's not too much trouble.
I got your back!

00:07.433 --> 00:10.200
This is Mabel. Mabel, this
is my other X chromosome.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.800
You just made your first child
support payment.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.433
You get visitation rights.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.800
I don't know what the heck
to do with a 15-year-old girl.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.133
Are we having fun? Yeah!

00:17.233 --> 00:18.900
And don't be late!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.967
Seriously... seriously,
don't be late.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.667
You did a great job
bringing her up.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.233
See, that's what I was doing,
while you were off...

00:24.333 --> 00:26.067
flushing your career
down the toilet.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.167
Are you looking at my boobs?

00:28.267 --> 00:32.267
Was I? I reckon some things
were meant to be appreciated.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.167
Come on... with another.

00:45.167 --> 00:46.567
Whoo!

00:47.833 --> 00:49.733
I've never made it with
a preacher before.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.700
Well, honey, then we got
somethin' in common.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.967
Hey, baby, just one second here.
What?

00:58.067 --> 00:59.167
Just push pause.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.167
Don't keep me waiting too long.

01:01.267 --> 01:04.533
Hey, you keep the motor running,
honey. Whoo!

01:06.233 --> 01:08.633
Excuse me here, brother.

01:09.967 --> 01:12.067
Agh!
[TINA] What's wrong, baby?

01:12.133 --> 01:14.367
I think I just saw a ghost.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.633
For real? Should I leave?

01:17.733 --> 01:19.667
Ah, I never let a little thing
like a ghost...

01:19.767 --> 01:23.067
stop me from doin'
what I do best.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.733

Coming!

01:43.233 --> 01:46.133
A blessed morning to you,
Pastor!

01:46.233 --> 01:47.433
You may have seen me scurrying
around here...

01:47.533 --> 01:48.733
like a little church mouse...

01:48.833 --> 01:50.700
but I just wanted to introduce
myself formally.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.100
I'm Laura Beth, head
of the booster committee.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.667
Nice to meet you, Laura Beth.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.067
Uh, scurry around to your
heart's content.

01:57.167 --> 01:58.400
Are you feeling okay, Pastor?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.433
Because you are looking a tad
discombobulated.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.867
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.633
It's just these early mornings,
you know...

02:03.733 --> 02:05.733
getting used to the time change
from Tulsa and all.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.567
But we're in the same time zone
as Tulsa...

02:07.667 --> 02:09.300
and it is already 8:00 A.M.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.900
Don't want to let the day
get away from us, do we?

02:11.067 --> 02:14.067
Exactly, which is why I have a
few things to discuss with you.

02:14.167 --> 02:17.800
Uh, let me finish my morning
devotions, I'll be right back.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.833
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, if that's
the case, you just--

02:19.933 --> 02:21.433
you take a couple of moments.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.367
Okay.
I'll be right out here.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.933
The Lord's work's awaitin'.
Okay, I'll be right here.

02:26.067 --> 02:27.567
I'm just gonna wait right here!

02:29.067 --> 02:32.567
I'm 99.9% sure we got the good
kind of weird last night.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.267
Well, if ya come back to bed...

02:34.367 --> 02:36.067
I would be more than happy
to refresh your memory.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.867
Oh, unfortunately, honey,
there's no rest for the wicked.

02:38.967 --> 02:42.500
Fare thee well, my lady.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.333
Can't I just go out
the front door?

02:44.433 --> 02:46.600
Oh, no, no, no, I figured we'd
do something crazy...

02:46.700 --> 02:48.100
kind of like Romeo and Juliet.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.867
I thought it'd be way
more romantic.

02:50.967 --> 02:52.867
Pastor Joe Johnson...

02:52.967 --> 02:56.400
you are a true gentleman
through and through.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.967

Shoot me your number and remind
me your first and last name...

03:00.433 --> 03:02.367
we'll do it again sometime.

03:03.967 --> 03:07.067
Actually, my girlfriends are
coming into town tonight...

03:07.167 --> 03:08.567
for the yoga convention.

03:08.667 --> 03:12.067
We could all hang out,
say around 7:00?

03:30.367 --> 03:31.700
Were you talking to somebody?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.267
No, no, no, I wasn't talking
to nobody.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.667
I was just doing my morning
prayers...

03:34.767 --> 03:37.267
for starving, orphan...
Nigerian children.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.567
Oh...

03:38.667 --> 03:41.400
Come on in. Welcome to my
humble abode.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.067
Oh, no, don't wanna sit there...

03:44.100 --> 03:46.167
that chair right there has
terrible lumbar support.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.367
Here just sit in this chair
right here.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.933
Oh... thank you.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.567
So... now, where were we?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.233
Well, it is pretty
self-explanatory...

03:54.333 --> 03:55.833
but with you being new
and all...

03:55.933 --> 03:57.933
I just wanted to make sure you
didn't have any questions.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.900
I only have two questions.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.767
What is this and what does
it have to do with me?

04:02.867 --> 04:05.400
Oh, it's a list
of your daily duties.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.133
Duties? I thought this was
a tight one hour...

04:08.233 --> 04:10.100
one-day-a-week type of gig.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.800
No, Pastor Jenkins, he had me
make him a list...

04:13.900 --> 04:15.167
of his pastoral duties
every day...

04:15.267 --> 04:16.700
so that he didn't forget
anything.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.900
You talking about this guy
right here in the painting?

04:19.067 --> 04:22.833
Yes... after his health
deteriorated it was--

04:22.933 --> 04:26.467
It was just time for him
to move on to a better place.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.800
Okay, you got water,
sunscreen, all that?

04:31.900 --> 04:34.267
Mom, do I really have to wear
this jacket?

04:34.367 --> 04:36.533
Of course, you don't have to...
you get to...

04:36.633 --> 04:38.700
because those tastefully studded
rhinestones...

04:38.800 --> 04:40.767
are gonna pay for your college
one day.

04:40.867 --> 04:44.067
Fine, I'll put on the jacket.

04:44.133 --> 04:45.400
Come on, babe, we gotta go.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.200
And where is that?

04:47.300 --> 04:49.433
You know where,
it's the Craft-xpo.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.733
I got us a booth to promote
Debbie Does Dazzles.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.600
Ooh, babe, gonna have to stop
you right there.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.333

is locked and loaded.

day drunk...

04:58.700 --> 05:01.733
and watchin' Tattoo Nightmares
on the Spike Network for men.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.867
Oh, well, that sounds like
a lot of fun.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.667
You know what? That'll give me
plenty of time to rethink...

05:05.767 --> 05:08.233
letting you shoot your show
in my basement.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.900
It's your call, babe.

or may not have reached...

here in a few.

wanna go home with somethin'...

about looks.

to be a nag here...

walk through my door...

05:47.600 --> 05:49.367

I'm gonna have to like--

today, I tell you.

you something to eat.

Okay, 'cause that means you're
gonna be free later!

06:28.567 --> 06:29.867
Because we are having
a program...

06:29.967 --> 06:31.467
to try and attract new
parishioners...

06:31.567 --> 06:33.067
because we sure could use
some more tithing.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.067
Oh, I'm all for drumming up
business, honey...

06:35.167 --> 06:38.067
but some ladies have fallen
from the Lord...

06:38.167 --> 06:40.367
and I'm gonna do my darnedest
to bring 'em back.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.967
Oh, I do not envy you,
Pastor Johnson.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.867

that could take all night.

teenage girl...

06:57.067 --> 06:59.300

of a time getting to like me.

out here?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.300
You missed a scheduled
appointment...

07:11.400 --> 07:14.133
and you forgot to turn
in your court card, you know?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.233
And I'm now obligated
to report this...

07:16.333 --> 07:18.900
and send a really good friend
back to jail.

07:24.100 --> 07:27.867
I guess I got caught up in my
community service out here.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.633
You know, I know this is gonna
sound silly...

07:29.733 --> 07:32.533
but I guess I really just
wanted to prove to you...

07:32.633 --> 07:35.300
and society as a whole,
that I'm a changed man.

this hiccup, okay?

to change here.

What do you got here?

07:50.967 --> 07:52.167
Like a "scared straight"
situation or something?

07:52.267 --> 07:53.267
Something like that.

I bet you do.

and stay in school, okay?

that marriage is forever...

it's not!

here, huh?

08:36.633 --> 08:38.200
Just 'cause he's a celebrity...

08:38.300 --> 08:40.333
don't go givin' him the
celebrity treatment or nothin'.

Hey, while I have you here,
Pastor Johnson...

08:42.633 --> 08:44.533
would you mind signing
my court card?

I'd be happy to,
Convict Vernon Brown.

08:46.733 --> 08:51.067
Right, that's a great idea. We
can get this done right here.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.233
Whoops. You ever sign someone
else's name by accident?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.967
No... never have.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.800
Oh, boy, okay, that's great.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.400

Bottomless mimosas.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.067
Take it easy, Pastor.

Do you think you could
maybe help us?

Hey, Ronnie...

09:10.500 --> 09:11.967
you see they're filming Flea
Market Fortunes here?

09:12.067 --> 09:13.600

your "totally authenti""
boat wheel prop...

09:15.300 --> 09:18.300
but you could be sitting
on a gold mine right now.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.733
Well, if it isn't
Dazzlin' Debbie.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.933
Well, if it isn't
Dania Twang.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.933
Still using your low-rent
Shania impersonation...

09:50.067 --> 09:51.567
to hock your De-Dazzlers?

09:51.667 --> 09:54.067
I figured she would have sued
you out of business by now.

09:54.133 --> 09:57.100
My performance is considered
100 percent legal parody.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.567
Oh, really?
They ruled you a joke?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.767
"Debbie Does Dazzles?"

10:01.867 --> 10:04.133
That don't impress me much.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.233
So, I woke up buck naked on the
back of a flatbed truck.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.300
A half empty bottle of whiskey
on my left...

10:11.400 --> 10:13.867
and two out of three of the
Mandrell sisters on my right.

10:13.967 --> 10:17.367
Oh, wow! Your stories
are the best, man, I swear.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.467
Gimme it all, the who, what,
where, how, when.

10:19.567 --> 10:22.167
Where were you were born,
where'd you lose your virginity?

10:22.267 --> 10:24.100
That kind of thing.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.300
I got this. I got it.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.333
Well, listen, I gotta get
down to the church...

10:30.433 --> 10:32.800
and start chipping away at that
mountain of community service.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.133
One more thing...

10:34.233 --> 10:36.400
You know who's a bigger fan
of yours than me?

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
My mom loves you.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.200
And it would mean the world...

10:40.300 --> 10:42.333
if she had an autograph
or something.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.700
Ah, hell, what's her name?

10:43.800 --> 10:46.133
I'll put it right here
on this napkin.

10:46.233 --> 10:50.700
Well, I was thinking that maybe
you and I could go down to the
nursing home, and you could do
it in person.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.867
Oh, man, you know, I'd love to,
but I got unbreakable plans...

10:54.967 --> 10:59.267
this evening and I'd actually
just be a real bear.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.767
No, I totally get it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.067
Tell you what'd be a bear,
though...

11:04.167 --> 11:05.867
is if I had to tell
the parole board...

11:05.967 --> 11:08.933
that my best friend missed
his appointment today.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.067
That'd be a bear.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.767
Rrr... that kind of thing.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.200
This is a really interesting
piece.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.333
I'm gonna guess it dates
probably early 20th century.

11:20.433 --> 11:21.967
Album? Who gives a hoot?

11:22.067 --> 11:23.467
Oh, my God, lady.

11:23.567 --> 11:28.067
Your halfwit kid make that
coffee mug in ceramics class?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.767
A freakin' leprechaun guitar?
Are you serious, dude?

11:30.867 --> 11:33.633
It's not even tuned.
Rainbow's that a-way.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.300
Oh, all right, dude,
that's cool.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.833
Like I was saying...
you holding, bro?

11:38.933 --> 11:41.100
All right, that's cool.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.567
Well, this place is nice.

11:45.667 --> 11:46.933
Yeah, thanks, thanks.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.867
Oh, hey, they got tango lessons!
We should join up.

11:49.967 --> 11:52.333
You know what, LOL! I'm gonna
go check on my mom.

11:52.433 --> 11:55.867
Harold, no dice.
Please, just one puddin' cup?

11:55.967 --> 11:58.567
Well, no puddin' except on
Puddin' Wednesdays!

11:58.667 --> 12:00.233
You know the rules.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.600
I never was one for rules,
either... outlaw.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.600
Thank you.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.333
Pastor Johnson!

12:41.433 --> 12:42.667
Oh, for hell's sake!

12:42.767 --> 12:44.767
Folks are gonna be
so excited to see you!

12:44.867 --> 12:46.867
There are so many prayer
requests!

12:46.967 --> 12:48.667
You know, honey, I think we
might be able to cover...

12:48.767 --> 12:50.367
more of the Lord's work
if we split up.

12:50.467 --> 12:53.567
I still gotta get back to church
for that Bible study in an hour.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.200
All right, I'll see you!

12:59.367 --> 13:01.767
Whoa! There you are!
Thought you ran off.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.067
I was gonna put out an A.P.B.
for you or something!

13:04.133 --> 13:07.467
Hey, Pastor Johnson,
nice to see you again.

13:07.567 --> 13:10.333
Hey, would you give my mom
a blessing?

13:10.433 --> 13:11.467
She doesn't have a lot
of time left here.

13:11.567 --> 13:12.500
Is she sick?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.933
No, this place is too pricey.

13:15.067 --> 13:18.100
Yes, I'd be happy to-- I'll give
her the Pastor Joe Jackson--

13:18.200 --> 13:19.600
Johnson.

13:19.700 --> 13:23.200
Johnson, ultimate platinum
prayer package, platinum-style.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.333
Oh, wow, thank you very much.
Boy!

13:25.433 --> 13:27.067
Burnin' Vernon and a man of God.

13:27.133 --> 13:29.867
My mom's gonna be so excited,
she's gonna have a heart attack.

13:29.967 --> 13:33.900
Come on, I'll show you!
Hey, Ma!

13:34.067 --> 13:37.633
Go on, boys, fire up
the De-Dazzler!

13:37.733 --> 13:41.067
Ooh, look at those boys firing
up the power.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.800
Who's ready to test
my Shan-aurantee?

13:45.767 --> 13:47.267
Mom, you should do it.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.300
Your Re-Dazzles are impossible
to remove!

13:51.400 --> 13:52.933
Believe me, I've tried.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.067
Really?
Yes.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.900
You think?
Yeah, go!

13:59.500 --> 14:01.633
I'll test your guarantee!

14:01.733 --> 14:05.833
Ooh! Step right up,
Dazzlin' Debbie!

14:05.933 --> 14:08.100
Ooh, I'm going to send these
dazzles...

14:08.200 --> 14:12.267
where they should have gone long
ago... straight to hell!

14:12.367 --> 14:14.333
Then they'll see you there.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.567
( DEVICE RUNNING )

14:32.533 --> 14:33.833
( DEVICE WHIRRING DOWN )

14:33.933 --> 14:36.800
Dazzles are here to stay!

14:38.067 --> 14:41.067
Does that impress you much?
Bitch.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.667
[SHANIA] I'll I need
is a back-up.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.333
So, honey, I dance up to the
edge of the stage...

14:52.433 --> 14:53.800
it's the big finale.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.900
I reach out and grab a hold
of the harness and up I fly!

14:57.067 --> 15:00.867
Over the crowd, like a redneck
Peter Pan!

15:00.967 --> 15:05.567
Well, about two months later,
Garth Brooks stole my trick.

15:05.667 --> 15:09.300
I think I remember seeing you do
that trick.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.833
Remember that night, Mitchell?

15:10.933 --> 15:13.133
Yes, Mother, yes, yes,
Knoxville.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.233
That was the night they gave my
ex-wife Cynthia...

15:15.333 --> 15:16.833
a backstage pass, sure, yeah.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.433
They picked her right
out of the crowd!

15:18.533 --> 15:22.233
Oh, and she stayed out all night
long talking to the band!

15:22.333 --> 15:25.900
And your friendly drummer gave
her a ride home.

15:26.067 --> 15:29.833
God, yeah, she really liked
concerts.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.100
How about that blessing,
huh, Pastor?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.267
Let's do it.
Okay.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.633
Uh... let's all bow our heads.

15:36.733 --> 15:40.567
Dearly-- dearly beloved...

15:40.667 --> 15:43.900
Jesus came down from the
Heavens...

15:44.067 --> 15:47.967
or some refer to it as the outer
bound of our known galaxy.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.700
His maker--
Praise the Lord!

15:51.800 --> 15:53.900
Amen!
That's one theory.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.733
Another is that angels, often
refered to as the Anunaki...

15:56.833 --> 15:58.967
were in fact, an ancient
race of aliens--

15:59.067 --> 16:01.667
Amen!

16:01.767 --> 16:02.900
Amen.
Amen.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.067
Amen.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.600
Pastor Johnson?
Oh, there you are!

16:06.700 --> 16:07.833
Ah... who might this be?

16:07.933 --> 16:09.500
Hi, I'm Laura Beth.
Hi.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.933
You might wanna go grab
that pen...

16:11.067 --> 16:12.733
and let's do that thing
we was talking about.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.067
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.967
Hey, nice to meet you.
Oh, you, too.

16:16.067 --> 16:16.867
Yeah.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.567
And what do you do, young lady?

16:18.667 --> 16:20.133
Oh, I work at the church
with Pastor Johnson.

16:20.233 --> 16:21.833
I'm the chair of the booster
committee.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.800
So I guess you could call me
the booster chair!

16:27.567 --> 16:30.067
You mean Pastor Johnson.

16:30.167 --> 16:34.467
That strapping young man
is the Burnin' Vernon...

16:34.567 --> 16:37.467
one of country music's
biggest stars.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.200
No disrespect, ma'am, but this
man is a convict...

16:42.300 --> 16:44.367
on his way to reform through
church service.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.800
And this man is Pastor
Johnson...

16:46.900 --> 16:49.467
the minister of First Light
Church.

16:49.567 --> 16:50.900
Mitchell! Mitchell!

16:51.067 --> 16:52.200
What, Mother? What, what, what?

16:52.300 --> 16:55.067
This young woman has me all
in a tizzy!

16:55.133 --> 16:58.467
She says that Burnin' Vernon
is a minister...

16:58.567 --> 17:01.700
and Pastor Johnson is a convict!

17:01.800 --> 17:03.467
What?

17:04.867 --> 17:07.833
Oh, yeah, I think I know
what's going on here.

17:07.933 --> 17:10.500
Everybody like to step
in the hallway...

17:10.600 --> 17:11.867
talk to me for a minute?

17:11.967 --> 17:13.500
Excuse me, Mother.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.800
She's a little drunk.

17:23.533 --> 17:24.800
Doily, I can explain.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.200
You know what?
No need to at all.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.267
I knew this day was coming.
I knew it.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.367
It's just sad when the mind
slips...

17:32.467 --> 17:36.933
and one has to give in to
the ravages of old age.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.233
I can't believe she couldn't
tell the difference...

17:39.333 --> 17:42.400
between Burnin' Vernon
and a preacher.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.200
It's the worst.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.167
Well, we'll be praying for her.

17:46.267 --> 17:49.567
Sometimes I even forget
who I'm supposed to be.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.833
On the plus side, hopefully her
dementia will make her forget...

17:52.933 --> 17:55.933
about all my many, many
failings, I don't know.

18:02.933 --> 18:05.900
You see that?
Yeah.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.533
Now this is a really
interesting item...

18:07.633 --> 18:10.700
and you sya that you were told
it's from the S.S. Minnow?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.767
That is correct, sir.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.767
Talked him down to $250.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.767
Okay, well, I will say after
looking it over...

18:16.867 --> 18:18.167
I do have some concerns.

18:18.267 --> 18:19.300
All right.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.833
The first being, I see an
inscription here...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.067
that says, Made in China.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.767
Now we all know, in the
mid-1960's...

18:23.867 --> 18:25.167
when Gilligan's Island
was on the air...

18:25.267 --> 18:28.133
the U.S. actually had no trade
agreement with China.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.167
That didn't come until 1972.

18:30.267 --> 18:32.567
So, I'm also a little concerned,
because I see another...

18:32.667 --> 18:35.700
engraving here that tells me
this is in fact a prop replica.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.500
But not from Gilligan's Island.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.567
Okay, so like The Love Boat
or something?

18:40.667 --> 18:43.067
Ah, no, it's actually from the
beloved fast-casual...

18:43.100 --> 18:45.067
seafood restaurant,
Shrimps-N-Such.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.667
See, it says Shrimps-N-Such?

18:47.767 --> 18:49.067
So how much is it worth?

18:49.100 --> 18:52.100
I would value it at
probably $10.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.900
Sonofabitch!

18:57.067 --> 18:58.367
Well, this is interesting.

18:58.467 --> 19:01.967
That urn you just broke, early
Prussian, valued at $500.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.433
Oh, really?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.167
Next.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.333
Oh, well now what do we have
here? You don't see these a lot.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.600
This is Polly, the first doll
with polio.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.133
Well, this was spiritual,
but I need to get out of here!

19:13.233 --> 19:15.267
I mean, a pastor signing
autographs.

19:15.367 --> 19:19.067
You really do inspire the light
in people, Pastor Johnson.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.667
It's ghost pastor...

19:29.433 --> 19:32.633
Okay, Pastor Johnson,
this is Pastor Jenkins.

19:32.733 --> 19:37.333
Now hold on here, I thought you
said he was in a better--

19:39.400 --> 19:43.200
That just seems
deliberately confusing.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.267
But it was nice ministering
to you good folks...

19:45.367 --> 19:48.233
but I gotta get back to church
for that Bible study.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.733
I took care of that
when I saw you were here.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.267
I called the
Senior's Bible Club...

19:52.367 --> 19:54.067
and they're gonna
step in for you.

19:54.167 --> 19:57.333
And that's how Jonah finally got
out of the whale.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.067
Now if you'll all turn in the
good book to Matthew...

20:00.167 --> 20:02.300
chapter five, in verse 32...

20:02.400 --> 20:08.033
we can discover the true nature
of the Lord's forgiving love.

20:10.033 --> 20:12.367
That's mighty Christian of you.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.633
Well, I'm gonna take you back
to your room, Pastor Jenkins.

20:14.733 --> 20:17.000
You'll get to talk with these
fellas some more next time...

20:17.100 --> 20:18.800
because we're here every week.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.367
Uh, I'm supposed to be here
every week?

20:20.467 --> 20:23.167
Yes, well, it is the best way
to increase attendance.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.900
We just keep coming back
until we can convince them...

20:26.000 --> 20:29.667
that we are the little church
that could!

20:32.033 --> 20:35.033
Okay, let's go. We'll see y'all.

20:36.967 --> 20:39.600
I think I'm getting an idea.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.667
That's right... come on.
( MUSIC PLAYING )

20:46.767 --> 20:48.467
That's right.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.967
* Well here you go
ya grateful geezers *

20:51.067 --> 20:53.233
