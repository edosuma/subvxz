WEBVTT

00:11.001 --> 00:13.568
Well, I removed three
marbles from that kid.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.328
Fourth one's a part of his head now.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.253
Oh, you're all watching college football?

00:18.254 --> 00:21.389
Sorry, Carol, we can't
have it on PBS all the time.

00:22.484 --> 00:23.918
Let me guess: you disapprove.

00:23.919 --> 00:27.055
Guys, you've got me all
wrong. I love college football.

00:27.056 --> 00:30.357
I grew up in the Midwest, so
it's just a part of who I am.

00:30.358 --> 00:33.726
My first crush was a cardboard
cutout of John Madden.

00:35.097 --> 00:38.332
Ooh, Carol likes a man
with some meat on his bones.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.903
Personally, I don't
enjoy college football

00:41.904 --> 00:44.412
because the coaches and
universities make millions

00:44.413 --> 00:47.341
while the players get paid in
dining hall chicken nuggets.

00:47.342 --> 00:49.756
Fun fact: The, uh,
quarterback in the green pants,

00:49.757 --> 00:51.579
Darrin Alexander, is dating Jerrica,

00:51.580 --> 00:54.582
my 13th favorite social media influencer.

00:54.583 --> 00:55.917
Oh, right.

00:55.918 --> 00:58.086
The one who sells the
juice cleanse on Instagram.

00:58.087 --> 00:59.286
Guys, guys, shh.

00:59.287 --> 01:01.028
If they don't convert this third down,

01:01.029 --> 01:04.056
your friend Darrin is
heading back to No-win-diana.

01:05.961 --> 01:08.595
That's what we call Western
Indiana, because they never win.

01:09.864 --> 01:10.998
'Cause they're losers.

01:10.999 --> 01:12.766
Alexander drops back to pass.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.635
- And he is sacked!
- Ooh!

01:14.636 --> 01:16.703
What a hit. Alexander is down.

01:16.704 --> 01:19.039
Ooh, he lost a shoe. That's bad.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.174
He's not getting up.

01:20.175 --> 01:21.791
Wait a second. We're
the nearest hospital

01:21.792 --> 01:24.077
to the stadium, so if he
gets injured, we'll get him.

01:24.078 --> 01:27.274
Oh, my God, how cool
would it be if he came here

01:27.275 --> 01:30.251
and Jerrica visited and
we became best friends?

01:30.252 --> 01:32.586
The trainers are waving the
ambulance onto the field.

01:32.587 --> 01:34.618
Darrin is coming to Loyola Memorial!

01:38.685 --> 01:41.623
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

01:48.302 --> 01:50.627
All right, everyone,

01:50.628 --> 01:52.972
I'm assigning the new patient in 510.

01:52.973 --> 01:54.873
He's a college football player...

01:55.448 --> 01:56.973
Hands down.

01:56.974 --> 01:58.106
This isn't a game show.

01:59.525 --> 02:01.481
The patient suffered
a small pneumothorax

02:01.482 --> 02:03.249
as a result of a rib fracture.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.152
He will be recovering here
until he flies back to Indiana.

02:06.153 --> 02:09.189
I understand the patient
is somewhat of a celebrity,

02:09.190 --> 02:13.326
so whoever I assign needs to
exercise the utmost discretion.

02:13.327 --> 02:16.429
Dr. Jacobs, if I may, it's
only fair that a college athlete

02:16.430 --> 02:19.265
be treated by a former college
athlete, someone who understands

02:19.266 --> 02:21.133
the pressure of being in the spotlight.

02:22.536 --> 02:24.704
You played intramural baseball

02:24.705 --> 02:26.739
and had to pay for your own jerseys.

02:28.209 --> 02:31.711
As a former college student and
current Instagram enthusiast...

02:31.712 --> 02:34.792
- No.
- As the third person to speak...

02:34.793 --> 02:36.626
No.

02:38.585 --> 02:43.088
Dr. Kenney has
miraculously remained quiet

02:43.089 --> 02:45.290
during all of this.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.792
That is the kind of
discretion we are looking for.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.160
He's yours.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.731
But you didn't even say anything.

02:52.732 --> 02:54.898
That's right, No-win-terns.

02:57.036 --> 02:59.471
I played that perfectly and kept quiet.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.140
And keeping quiet is not easy for me.

03:01.141 --> 03:02.407
I mean, you guys know.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.509
I'm not allowed back
into three movie theaters.

03:05.745 --> 03:07.146
Kenney gets the handoff.

03:07.147 --> 03:08.747
Ooh, to the ten.

03:08.748 --> 03:10.282
She's at the five.

03:10.283 --> 03:12.417
She's got one man to beat.

03:12.418 --> 03:14.352
And scores! Touchdown!

03:18.758 --> 03:20.559
Well, I guess that
answers the question of

03:20.560 --> 03:22.693
whether Carol still has her real hips.

03:26.732 --> 03:28.099
Oh, Doctor...

03:28.100 --> 03:30.802
Oh, careful. You don't
want to lose your...

03:30.803 --> 03:32.470
- Copaphil?
- Yeah.

03:32.471 --> 03:35.438
It's my company's new erectile
dysfunction medication.

03:36.558 --> 03:38.677
And yes, that's a horse
jumping over a fence.

03:40.245 --> 03:42.981
I have no idea what it has to
do with erectile dysfunction.

03:42.982 --> 03:44.615
Another E.D. med?

03:44.616 --> 03:46.450
Isn't the market a little oversaturated?

03:46.451 --> 03:48.252
Yeah, but at least this
one has new features.

03:48.253 --> 03:49.453
It has fewer side effects,

03:49.454 --> 03:50.955
you don't have to take it with meals,

03:50.956 --> 03:52.991
and it lasts over four hours.

03:55.427 --> 03:57.162
Over four hours?

03:57.163 --> 03:59.563
Is that a benefit or a punishment?

04:00.666 --> 04:02.466
Either way, sounds
like a long afternoon.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.502
Afternoon?

04:04.503 --> 04:07.538
Well, a lot of the people who
take these drugs are older,

04:07.539 --> 04:09.306
so afternoon is basically their night.

04:11.342 --> 04:15.145
Well, I found your pitch to
be fantastic. I'd prescribe it.

04:15.146 --> 04:17.613
Well, I wish anyone cared
what interns thought.

04:17.615 --> 04:21.017
Because if I can't get other
doctors to prescribe this,

04:21.019 --> 04:22.953
I won't hit my quarterly goal.

04:22.954 --> 04:24.321
You got this, Jenny Kenney.

04:24.322 --> 04:25.322
Thanks.

04:25.323 --> 04:27.734
It's cute how your name rhymes.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.530
Daniel, I know we had some fun
at the bar the other night...

04:33.531 --> 04:36.700
Yeah, I was really charming.

04:36.701 --> 04:39.636
But I should probably
tell you, I have a rule.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.038
I don't date doctors.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.706
Yeah, well, that's perfect,

04:42.707 --> 04:45.142
because, uh, I actually
have a rule, too.

04:45.143 --> 04:46.743
I don't date pharma reps.

04:48.479 --> 04:51.215
Good. Because I think
we should stay friends.

04:51.216 --> 04:53.550
Good. Same.

04:53.551 --> 04:55.552
Friends.

04:55.553 --> 04:58.054
Just try not to stare
at me when I walk away.

04:58.055 --> 05:00.415
For your sake, it's probably
good this coat covers my tushy.

05:16.006 --> 05:18.074
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

05:18.075 --> 05:19.409
I'm Dr. Kenney.

05:19.410 --> 05:22.035
Tom Dean, head coach,
Western Indiana University.

05:22.036 --> 05:23.228
Great to meet you, Coach.

05:23.229 --> 05:24.988
I'm an admirer of your career,

05:24.989 --> 05:26.740
except when you play Michigan State.

05:26.741 --> 05:28.547
- Oh, you went to Michigan State.
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.548 --> 05:31.808
You sure you're a real doctor?

05:31.809 --> 05:34.223
Are you sure you're
a real football team?

05:35.759 --> 05:37.593
- Ooh, feisty Spartan.
- Yeah.

05:37.594 --> 05:39.095
Well, I used to be a teacher.

05:39.096 --> 05:41.097
A lot of my students
were athletes, so...

05:41.098 --> 05:44.600
I am down to clown.

05:44.601 --> 05:46.555
It was eight years
ago. I'm a little rusty.

05:46.556 --> 05:49.538
So, Darrin, are your parents joining us?

05:49.539 --> 05:50.915
My mom's flying in.

05:50.916 --> 05:53.910
So you incurred a collapsed
lung when you got hit.

05:53.911 --> 05:55.778
It'll probably improve on its own,

05:55.779 --> 05:57.533
but we just want to monitor it.

05:57.534 --> 05:58.892
How you feeling right now?

05:58.893 --> 06:00.283
I think he's feeling pretty good.

06:00.284 --> 06:01.450
I'm feeling pretty good.

06:01.451 --> 06:03.119
Uh-huh.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.011
And how do you feel when you breathe?

06:05.012 --> 06:06.051
Oh.

06:06.052 --> 06:08.390
So, a little pain there.

06:08.391 --> 06:09.391
Nope. He's good.

06:10.927 --> 06:12.519
Darrin, what would you say?

06:12.520 --> 06:13.962
Yep, I'm good.

06:13.963 --> 06:16.146
So, Doc, look, can my man go home now

06:16.147 --> 06:17.557
and get ready for next week's game?

06:17.558 --> 06:19.082
I mean, look at him. He's fine.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.436
The hit he took was no big deal.

06:20.437 --> 06:22.003
No big deal?

06:22.004 --> 06:24.839
A 300-pound man fell on his lung.

06:26.142 --> 06:28.276
Yeah, but I'll tell you
what, if my man had

06:28.277 --> 06:29.778
gotten out of the pocket sooner,

06:29.779 --> 06:31.146
he could've scrambled for a first down.

06:31.147 --> 06:33.482
And I would have, but I was out of gas.

06:33.483 --> 06:36.284
Wait, you were fatigued before the hit?

06:36.285 --> 06:38.620
Of course he was fatigued,
Doc. He was playing football.

06:38.621 --> 06:41.789
Not step aerobics.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.659
First of all, step
aerobics is exhausting.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.594
Secondly,

06:46.595 --> 06:48.864
it was only the first quarter
and your third possession

06:48.865 --> 06:50.598
after two lame three-and-out drives.

06:50.599 --> 06:52.000
So he should've been fine.

06:52.001 --> 06:53.835
Oh, snap, Coach.

06:53.836 --> 06:56.104
Did you just get
roasted by a tiny doctor?

06:56.105 --> 06:57.939
Thank you.

06:57.940 --> 06:59.941
I'm gonna order some
tests to work this up,

06:59.942 --> 07:01.642
and I'm not gonna
clear Darrin for travel

07:01.643 --> 07:03.511
unless everything comes back negative.

07:03.512 --> 07:06.481
Okay, you know what, then?
Maybe, uh... maybe I just need

07:06.482 --> 07:08.849
to find another doctor
to discharge Darrin.

07:08.850 --> 07:11.318
Well, you are welcome to try.

07:11.319 --> 07:13.187
But there isn't a
doctor in this hospital

07:13.188 --> 07:14.855
who would release him at this point.

07:14.856 --> 07:17.391
So if you want to spend
more time here, go ahead.

07:17.392 --> 07:19.360
Otherwise, I will run some tests.

07:19.361 --> 07:21.528
Hmm? Does that work for you, Darrin?

07:21.529 --> 07:22.696
That works.

07:22.697 --> 07:23.697
That works.

07:23.698 --> 07:24.999
Great.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.368
You know what doesn't work?

07:27.369 --> 07:28.768
Your red zone offense.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.134
Hey. So I've been thinking about it,

07:36.135 --> 07:38.426
and I'm pretty sure the picture
on the box is meant to represent

07:38.427 --> 07:40.594
a stallion jumping over
the hurdle of impotence.

07:42.717 --> 07:45.019
- How's sales?
- Awful.

07:45.020 --> 07:47.021
I feel like I'm working at Costco.

07:47.022 --> 07:49.556
Everyone just keeps taking
samples and not buying anything.

07:51.059 --> 07:53.293
Well, if it helps, it's
two-for-one burrito day,

07:53.294 --> 07:54.361
and I got you one.

07:54.362 --> 07:56.496
For free, but, you
know, it's the thought.

07:56.497 --> 07:59.533
Okay. Because you remember
what I said earlier?

07:59.534 --> 08:01.401
Yes, you are a professional woman

08:01.402 --> 08:04.203
who won't date a single,
attractive, successful doctor.

08:04.204 --> 08:07.150
Eh, I would, but Dr.
Frost is too old for me.

08:08.843 --> 08:11.244
Look, this is fun,

08:11.245 --> 08:12.946
but I know your type:

08:12.947 --> 08:15.515
handsome, hotshot doctor
who only cares about himself.

08:15.516 --> 08:17.050
Hey, that's not true.

08:17.051 --> 08:18.552
I'm also highly intelligent.

08:20.437 --> 08:22.329
- And so humble.
- Exactly.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.524
So what's the real reason?
Is it because of your mom?

08:24.525 --> 08:25.658
Because I can take her.

08:27.394 --> 08:29.495
Well, maybe. She's scrappy.

08:30.598 --> 08:32.364
Thanks for the burrito, friend.

08:35.594 --> 08:37.236
Do you need a Big Gulp?

08:37.236 --> 08:41.139
'Cause you look pretty thirsty.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.980
Guys, Jenny and I are just friends.

08:44.981 --> 08:46.783
Oh, really? 'Cause we're your friends,

08:46.784 --> 08:49.150
and you've bought us lunch zero times.

08:49.151 --> 08:51.085
One time, you stole my lunch.

08:52.254 --> 08:54.188
In fact, you owe me a burrito.

09:00.797 --> 09:02.464
Dr. Kenney?

09:02.465 --> 09:03.998
We need to talk to you.

09:03.999 --> 09:06.802
Yeah, I-I know, I know. I
was short with the coach.

09:06.803 --> 09:07.936
That's not it.

09:07.937 --> 09:09.904
We got the results of Darrin's echo.

09:09.905 --> 09:13.107
He has hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy.

09:13.108 --> 09:16.812
As an athlete, he runs the
risk of a fatal cardiac event.

09:16.813 --> 09:18.847
Oh, now I have to tell that poor kid

09:18.848 --> 09:21.149
he needs to stop playing football.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.985
I wish his mom was here already;
I can't get through to him

09:23.986 --> 09:26.254
with that jerk-nose coach in the room.

09:26.255 --> 09:27.855
- "Jerk-nose"?
- Yeah, jerk-nose.

09:28.658 --> 09:30.258
He doesn't care about Darrin's health.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.627
He just wants to get that
kid back out onto the field.

09:32.628 --> 09:34.162
Oh, he can't be that callous.

09:34.163 --> 09:35.764
Unfortunately, it's very common.

09:35.765 --> 09:37.466
When I ran track at Stanford,

09:37.467 --> 09:40.335
my coach pushed me to run, even
after I pulled my hamstring.

09:40.336 --> 09:41.703
That's terrible.

09:41.704 --> 09:43.171
I agree with Dr. Kenney.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.706
She should deliver the news
to Darrin and Darrin alone.

09:45.707 --> 09:48.442
But if Coach Dean sees me,
he's not going anywhere.

09:48.443 --> 09:51.779
Well, then let's get him out of there.

09:51.780 --> 09:54.200
Ooh. Subterfuge.

09:56.986 --> 09:58.887
Hey. Oh, sorry to interrupt.

09:58.888 --> 10:01.222
Dr. Stephen Frost, department chair.

10:01.223 --> 10:04.125
One might say I'm the
head coach of the hospital.

10:04.126 --> 10:05.659
Oh, hey. I guess that makes me

10:05.660 --> 10:07.628
head surgeon of the football program.

10:09.365 --> 10:10.365
No.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.068
Coach, I'd like to discuss
Darrin's travel arrangements

10:14.069 --> 10:15.870
to help expedite his discharge.

10:15.871 --> 10:17.162
Oh, fantastic.

10:17.163 --> 10:19.140
Paperwork's in my office.
You want to come with me?

10:19.141 --> 10:20.375
Uh, could you bring the papers in here?

10:20.376 --> 10:21.509
I don't want to leave my guy.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.511
Ah...

10:23.512 --> 10:25.012
there's the rub.

10:26.715 --> 10:28.149
It's an e-document.

10:28.150 --> 10:30.651
Uh, you have to be signed on
to the hospital portal and...

10:30.652 --> 10:31.886
Oh, can I just use my phone, then?

10:31.887 --> 10:35.322
Ah, well, it's not compatible with...
What-what phone do you have?

10:35.323 --> 10:37.022
- iPhone.
- Oh. Definitely not.

10:38.559 --> 10:39.691
- Let's go.
- Okay.

10:51.705 --> 10:55.008
Hi, Darrin.

10:55.009 --> 10:57.877
Um, I wanted to talk to
you about your test results.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.780
You have a condition

11:00.781 --> 11:03.383
called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

11:03.384 --> 11:06.219
Is that bad?

11:06.220 --> 11:07.587
It can be.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.722
But the good news is it's manageable.

11:09.723 --> 11:11.425
Under the care of a cardiologist,

11:11.426 --> 11:12.991
you could live a normal life.

11:14.057 --> 11:15.581
But...

11:15.582 --> 11:19.406
if you keep playing sports,
there's a 10% chance

11:19.407 --> 11:21.534
that your heart could
give out on the field.

11:21.535 --> 11:26.038
And the only way to
significantly reduce the risk

11:26.039 --> 11:28.407
is to stop playing football.

11:28.408 --> 11:31.410
Okay, I understand.

11:31.411 --> 11:33.212
So am I cleared to go home?

11:33.213 --> 11:35.714
Wow.

11:35.715 --> 11:37.549
You are taking this really well.

11:37.550 --> 11:40.119
I know football is a
big part of your life,

11:40.120 --> 11:41.887
but there's a future outside of it.

11:41.888 --> 11:43.722
You know, I wasn't always a doctor.

11:43.723 --> 11:46.758
Not a lot of people know this,
but I used to be an educator.

11:46.759 --> 11:49.252
Oh, no, no. That's not what I meant.

11:49.253 --> 11:51.397
I-I'm gonna keep playing football.

11:51.398 --> 11:53.065
Excuse me?

11:53.066 --> 11:56.068
You said if I keep playing,
there's only a 10% chance

11:56.069 --> 11:57.936
something really bad could happen.

11:57.937 --> 12:02.941
Yes, but are you willing to
risk your life for a game?

12:02.942 --> 12:05.110
Doctors aren't always right.

12:06.413 --> 12:09.948
When I shattered my leg,
doctors told me to stop playing.

12:09.949 --> 12:11.817
I didn't listen.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.953
Now I'm a starter, a captain.

12:14.954 --> 12:18.524
And I have a girlfriend with the
number one selling juice line.

12:18.525 --> 12:19.625
I'm playing.

12:21.127 --> 12:24.195
You know, your girlfriend will
love you no matter what you do.

12:24.196 --> 12:26.430
That's 100% not true.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.103
But if you just give me
some time to explain...

12:32.104 --> 12:33.972
That doctor gave me the runaround.

12:33.973 --> 12:36.141
Of course. It's you.

12:36.142 --> 12:38.543
Well, I'm not thrilled
to see you either.

12:44.635 --> 12:47.353
- All right, that's it, Darrin. We're leaving.
- Great.

12:47.354 --> 12:49.646
Can I take a second to
change into my normal clothes?

12:49.647 --> 12:51.748
This gown doesn't cover my butt.

12:51.749 --> 12:54.884
No. You are keeping
that butt in that bed.

12:54.885 --> 12:57.324
Darrin has a serious condition.

12:57.325 --> 12:58.754
- But I'm good.
- He's good.

12:58.755 --> 13:00.422
He's not good!

13:00.423 --> 13:02.750
All right, somebody
better get me some pants,

13:02.751 --> 13:03.826
'cause I'm about to stand up.

13:03.827 --> 13:04.927
Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait.

13:04.928 --> 13:07.249
Dr. Kenney, face it,
you're out of plays.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.775
Okay? We are leaving this hospital.

13:08.776 --> 13:10.666
Where is my son?

13:10.667 --> 13:12.234
- Darrin.
- Mom.

13:12.235 --> 13:14.737
Mom.

13:14.738 --> 13:16.505
I have been so scared since I heard.

13:16.506 --> 13:18.607
Not to worry, Kathleen. I've
got everything covered, okay?

13:18.608 --> 13:22.512
Coach, thank you so much
for keeping Darrin company,

13:22.513 --> 13:25.447
but if you don't mind, I'd like
to speak to the doctor, alone.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.450
Thank you.

13:29.856 --> 13:31.380
This is better than when you lost

13:31.381 --> 13:32.854
in overtime to Northwestern.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.323
They were holding on that touchdown.

13:35.324 --> 13:36.457
Tell it to the scoreboard.

13:39.295 --> 13:41.163
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

13:41.164 --> 13:43.031
But wouldn't your patients be happier

13:43.032 --> 13:44.632
with fewer negative drug interactions?

13:44.633 --> 13:47.035
I'm sorry, Ms. Kenney, but I
don't need to hear the pitch.

13:47.036 --> 13:49.203
I don't see the point in
switching E.D. medications.

13:52.542 --> 13:53.775
Hey.

13:53.776 --> 13:55.143
Well, that's it.

13:55.144 --> 13:56.778
That was my last shot.

13:56.779 --> 13:58.045
My quarter is screwed.

14:01.650 --> 14:02.951
Excuse me, Dr. Gilbert.

14:02.952 --> 14:04.452
I couldn't help but overhear you.

14:04.453 --> 14:06.445
I'd love to be able to
prescribe an E.D. med

14:06.446 --> 14:08.322
that didn't interfere
with other medications.

14:08.323 --> 14:09.624
Trust me, they're all the same.

14:09.625 --> 14:10.824
Just prescribe what we have.

14:15.330 --> 14:16.898
Actually, sir, they're not the same.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.633
And I'm not speaking as a doctor,

14:18.634 --> 14:19.833
I'm speaking as a patient.

14:22.638 --> 14:24.571
Because...

14:28.143 --> 14:29.910
... I have erectile dysfunction.

14:33.766 --> 14:35.633
And as someone who suffers from E.D.,

14:35.634 --> 14:38.136
I'd love a pill that
had fewer side effects,

14:38.137 --> 14:40.617
could be taken without food, and
lasted longer than four hours.

14:44.235 --> 14:46.203
It's very important to me.

14:46.204 --> 14:47.737
For my E.D.

14:50.876 --> 14:52.275
Thank you, Dr. Kutcher.

14:52.276 --> 14:54.111
It's helpful to hear from someone with

14:54.112 --> 14:56.345
personal experience.

14:58.383 --> 15:00.583
Okay, Ms. Kenney, I'll hear you out.

15:03.254 --> 15:04.854
Thank you.

15:09.227 --> 15:10.893
Just so we're clear...

15:11.930 --> 15:13.497
... I do not have E.D.

15:13.498 --> 15:15.766
So if you don't have E.D.,

15:15.767 --> 15:19.302
you just did that because you
have a massive crush on Jenny?

15:19.303 --> 15:20.303
No.

15:20.304 --> 15:21.938
Oh, so then you do have E.D.

15:23.074 --> 15:24.941
No.

15:24.942 --> 15:27.502
- So if you don't have E.D., you like Jenny.
- It's not a riddle!

15:29.280 --> 15:31.781
Sometimes people just do things.

15:31.782 --> 15:34.284
Hey, we're your friends.

15:34.285 --> 15:36.352
You can stop being ashamed.

15:38.456 --> 15:40.957
It's time to start using your voice,

15:40.958 --> 15:43.959
since you can't use your penis.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.597
I can use my penis.

15:58.042 --> 16:00.810
Oh, they've been in there a while, huh?

16:00.811 --> 16:02.979
Darrin's got a new voice in his ear now.

16:02.980 --> 16:04.647
A mom voice.

16:04.648 --> 16:07.784
Is it like a tiny doctor voice?

16:07.785 --> 16:09.145
'Cause that one's pretty annoying.

16:10.821 --> 16:12.289
Don't be too upset.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.723
You played a good offensive game,

16:13.724 --> 16:15.791
but you just were no
match for my defense.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.659
Okay, please, please stop
talking about football.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.195
Yeah, I'm sick of it, too.

16:19.196 --> 16:21.964
Hey.

16:21.965 --> 16:24.333
Oh. So did you two have a good talk?

16:24.334 --> 16:26.735
- We did.
- Great. I am so glad, because...

16:26.736 --> 16:27.970
Darrin's gonna keep playing.

16:27.971 --> 16:29.805
What?

16:29.806 --> 16:31.307
Yes!

16:31.308 --> 16:33.476
We are out of here.

16:33.477 --> 16:35.344
Uh, hang on, hang on.

16:35.345 --> 16:37.879
So you're just going along with this?

16:37.880 --> 16:39.848
I thought you would be on my side.

16:39.849 --> 16:41.016
Excuse me?

16:41.017 --> 16:42.585
I'm a mother, too.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.643
And I just don't understand
how you could let Darrin

16:44.644 --> 16:46.369
make such a dangerous decision.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.523
Aren't you scared?

16:47.524 --> 16:49.203
He plays football.

16:49.204 --> 16:50.493
I'm never not scared.

16:50.494 --> 16:52.561
Well, it's gonna be a
whole lot scarier for you

16:52.562 --> 16:53.996
after this diagnosis.

16:53.997 --> 16:57.566
Didn't you say that there's a
90% chance that he'll be fine?

16:57.567 --> 17:00.585
- Well, yes, but...
- And, plus, we looked it up.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.912
There are plenty of professional
players with this condition

17:02.913 --> 17:04.172
who continue to play.

17:04.173 --> 17:06.508
I suppose technically that's true.

17:06.509 --> 17:10.545
But as a physician, I have to
strongly advise against this.

17:10.546 --> 17:13.381
He's over 18. His mind is made up.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.950
So what I can do is support his dream.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.952
Football is what he
loves most in the world.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.554
I won't take that away from him.

17:19.555 --> 17:20.855
Even if it keeps him safe?

17:20.856 --> 17:22.423
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:22.424 --> 17:23.958
Can you guarantee my son a life

17:23.959 --> 17:25.627
where nothing bad will
ever happen to him?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.194
Because I can't.

17:27.195 --> 17:28.896
I don't understand.

17:28.897 --> 17:30.730
You don't have to.

17:39.107 --> 17:41.742
Oh. Daniel, I have great news.

17:41.743 --> 17:42.977
I hit my quarterly goal!

17:42.978 --> 17:44.412
I couldn't have done it without you.

17:44.413 --> 17:47.255
- Seriously, thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:47.256 --> 17:49.050
What's most important to
me is that I helped you.

17:49.051 --> 17:50.552
But what's a close second,

17:50.553 --> 17:53.153
and actually first, is that
you know that I was lying.

17:54.589 --> 17:58.258
My bathing suit areas are a go. Okay?

17:58.259 --> 17:59.426
Okay.

17:59.427 --> 18:02.563
Are you free for a thank-you dinner?

18:02.564 --> 18:04.565
Outside the hospital?

18:04.566 --> 18:07.099
But that-that sounds like a...

18:07.902 --> 18:10.003
Oh.

18:10.004 --> 18:11.738
I thought you don't go out with doctors.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.407
I'm not going out with a doctor.

18:13.408 --> 18:15.442
You're going out with me.

18:15.443 --> 18:18.245
Just try not to watch me as I walk away.

18:18.246 --> 18:20.279
It's a good thing my
bag covers my tushy.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.855
Okay, what's the plan
to make this right?

18:28.856 --> 18:31.186
Call the university.
The athletic director.

18:31.187 --> 18:32.526
No, the dean.

18:32.527 --> 18:34.127
Ooh, does Darrin have a grandma?

18:34.128 --> 18:35.995
I understand your frustration.

18:35.996 --> 18:37.931
You can't call his grandma.

18:37.932 --> 18:39.632
You're right. Grandpa.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.967
Dr. Kenney!

18:41.968 --> 18:44.970
How our patients choose
to live their lives

18:44.971 --> 18:47.940
once they leave our care
is ultimately up to them.

18:47.941 --> 18:50.509
It's just...

18:50.510 --> 18:52.878
I busted my butt through
four years of med school

18:52.879 --> 18:54.614
because I wanted to help people.

18:54.615 --> 18:56.982
I mean, why did I put
myself through all of that

18:56.983 --> 18:59.385
just to have patients
disregard my advice?

19:00.621 --> 19:03.054
I didn't have to become
a doctor, you know.

19:03.957 --> 19:05.057
I could've been the...

19:05.058 --> 19:07.323
the sassy local librarian.

19:07.324 --> 19:09.916
I could've sold honey
at the farmers market.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.929
I could've just really
got into drinking.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.535
All noble pursuits.

19:16.536 --> 19:18.571
But I don't think
you'd get the same level

19:18.572 --> 19:21.507
of satisfaction you get
from practicing medicine.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.009
Your commitment to your patients

19:24.010 --> 19:26.511
is what makes you a great doctor.

19:26.512 --> 19:29.347
It's also what makes
it so hard to let go.

19:29.348 --> 19:30.749
Yeah.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.085
Well, letting go isn't my strong suit.

19:33.086 --> 19:35.849
You know, I used to give
my students my phone number

19:35.850 --> 19:37.542
in case they had problems.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.034
Well, I hope you're not

19:39.035 --> 19:40.159
doing that with your patients.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.393
No. Of course not.

19:41.394 --> 19:43.627
Oh. Excuse me.

19:44.998 --> 19:46.798
Hello.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.936
How's your appendectomy scar healing?

19:52.125 --> 19:53.125
Great.

19:56.276 --> 19:58.979
I think our patient in 506
needs a surgery consult.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.618
I couldn't reduce the hernia.

20:00.619 --> 20:04.150
Uh, I concur, but we
should get a second opinion.

20:04.151 --> 20:06.152
What do you think, Dr. Saggy Peen?

20:11.225 --> 20:12.459
Okay, enough.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.227
You've had a good run. It's over.

20:14.228 --> 20:16.829
- I don't want to hear any more about this.
- Fine.

20:16.830 --> 20:19.598
But you should know we
did tell one other person.

20:23.449 --> 20:25.616
Look at this brave boy right here.

20:27.808 --> 20:31.944
Daniel, what you did today
took a lot of courage.

20:31.945 --> 20:33.613
- Carol...
- And I just want to tell you,

20:33.614 --> 20:36.816
you are not less of a man for
sharing, you're more of a man.

20:36.817 --> 20:39.951
Erectile dysfunction is
nothing to be ashamed of.

20:39.952 --> 20:42.488
Carol, I don't have
erectile dysfunction.

20:43.234 --> 20:46.625
Then why did you tell
Dr. Gilbert you did?

20:46.626 --> 20:47.959
Yeah, Daniel.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.095
Why would you say such a
thing if it weren't true?

20:51.096 --> 20:53.296
Because I...

20:56.435 --> 20:58.235
I have erectile dysfunction.
