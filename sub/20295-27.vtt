-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.533 --> 00:36.600
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.167
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.200 --> 00:40.767
in a court of law.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.867
-I've been here 18 years.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.833
I spent about seven or eight
years up in narcotics,

00:46.867 --> 00:50.267
and the other 10, 11 years
I've been on patrol.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.500
Narcotics is fun.

00:51.533 --> 00:53.567
You can actually conduct
a whole thorough investigation

00:53.600 --> 00:54.767
from start to finish.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.233
Patrol is fun too,

00:56.267 --> 00:58.433
'cause you're just dealing with
a variety of different things.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.067
You know, every day
is different.

01:00.100 --> 01:03.067
-(radio chatter)

01:03.100 --> 01:06.067
-There's a unit chasing a guy
who possibly shot off a gun.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.533
They lost him, uh...

01:08.567 --> 01:10.500
in these yards
right around here.

01:10.533 --> 01:13.400
So we're gonna try to get out
and help 'em out

01:13.433 --> 01:14.800
right around here.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.400
-(radio chatter)

01:20.433 --> 01:22.367
-There they are.
Right there. I see cops.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.733
There's cops right there.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.367
Minhaj, where'd you
see him last?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.400
-He walked through here.

01:26.433 --> 01:27.700
-He's in here somewhere?
-Yeah.

01:27.733 --> 01:28.733
He's definitely in here.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.333
There's no way he
made it that far.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.667
-He's gotta be in here?
We got dogs.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.267
This is the guy
with the mohawk?

01:34.300 --> 01:36.900
-Yeah, he has a mohawk,
dark skin, medium brown,

01:36.933 --> 01:38.233
jeans, shorts, tank-top.

01:38.267 --> 01:39.367
-Jean shorts, tank-top.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.767
-Shirtless!
-He's shirtless.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.267
Oh, his shirt's off.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.300
He's gotta be in here, right?

01:44.333 --> 01:45.533
-There's no way
he got that far.

01:46.633 --> 01:49.067
-So he's bedded down somewhere.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.433
Right now we're
going with the K9 unit.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.767
He's probably hiding in this
shrubbery down here somewhere.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.367
We're gonna see if the dog can
hit on anything out here.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.167
He ran over the foot bridge,
you said, right?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.633
-He was going towards
the bridge,

02:03.667 --> 02:05.600
and then he ran
through the baseball field.

02:07.267 --> 02:10.233
-Our suspect bailed out
and he ran into this area.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.533
They're gonna try to backtrack
from where he started running.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.433
I wonder if
he hit the stream, dude?

02:15.467 --> 02:16.833
You think he went in the drink?

02:16.867 --> 02:18.067
-(dogs barking)
-(shouting)

02:18.100 --> 02:19.267
-We got him!

02:19.300 --> 02:22.367
-Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

02:22.400 --> 02:24.200
-Yeah, over here, guys!

02:26.567 --> 02:28.167
-Get on the ground!
-Ack.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.967
-Get on the ground! Arms out!

02:30.067 --> 02:31.767
Get on the ground! Don't move!

02:31.800 --> 02:33.633
Put your hands out!
Put your hands out!

02:33.667 --> 02:35.167
-Put 'em behind your back!

02:35.200 --> 02:38.267
-I told you man!
Please don't hurt me, bro.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.600
Please, don't hurt me.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.100
-You got him?

02:43.133 --> 02:44.400
-What's going on?

02:44.433 --> 02:46.600
What's the problem? All I see
you guys is chasing me.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.600
And I don't know why,
but please, somebody tell me.

02:48.633 --> 02:50.433
-Uh, guys, we got him.
We're still in the woods.

02:50.467 --> 02:51.833
-Please, I'm scared
for my life.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.433
Man, I just want to know
why y'all chasing me.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.833
-Why you running?
-And why are you so wet?

02:55.867 --> 02:57.067
Did you go in the water?

02:57.067 --> 02:58.433
You went for
a swim, didn't you?

02:58.467 --> 03:01.133
-Basically we stopped
by Kennedy High School,

03:01.167 --> 03:03.100
and as we're walking
down the steps,

03:03.133 --> 03:07.233
we see a black male,
no shirt, jean shorts,

03:07.267 --> 03:09.333
fitting the same description
as they gave out.

03:09.367 --> 03:10.900
-What description?
-As we're approaching him,

03:10.933 --> 03:12.167
he takes off running.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.067
We lose him at one point,
now we got him.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.467
-Good job, bud.
Stand up.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.800
-Ahh! Can't move.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.200
-You can't move?
You just ran a mile.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.500
-I don't know why
y'all are chasing me.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.133
-Work with me, cuz.
-I'm trying.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.767
-All right, come on.
One, two, three.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.133
-Ah! These are too tight.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.367
The cuffs are
too tight, bro, please.
-Come on.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.733
-Sir, can you please tell him
to loosen up the cuffs just
a little bit, please?

03:30.767 --> 03:31.967
-No. No.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.267
-Please.
-No.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.067
-I ain't trying to make
your job harder, bro.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.833
-Make our job harder?
You did that already.

03:36.867 --> 03:37.933
-I was scared.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.600
-Now that you're caught
the job's easy.

03:39.633 --> 03:40.933
-I see y'all coming,
I'm scared, bro.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.967
What do you want me to do?

03:43.067 --> 03:45.267
-14, we got him right here.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.667
He's right here.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.133
Uh...
-(dog barking)

03:48.167 --> 03:49.867
-Hey, chief, is there an alley
right up this way?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.133
-Come over here!

03:51.167 --> 03:53.167
-I'm not gonna make it up there.
-You gotta make it.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.900
-All right. Come on. Get up.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.500
-I can't get up there.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.667
-I can't--
I can't get it like this.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.400
-Dude, it's either
you're gonna get up and walk,

04:00.433 --> 04:01.800
or we're gonna have
to drag you.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.067
-Come on.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.333
-You got lucky.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.300
If they had the dog
without the leash,

04:07.333 --> 04:10.200
my god, that dog woulda chewed
your butt to pieces.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.367
-(barking)

04:12.400 --> 04:13.467
-How old are you?

04:13.500 --> 04:14.933
-24.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.067
-24?
-Yeah.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.067
-What's your name, man?

04:18.100 --> 04:20.200
-Aaron...

04:20.233 --> 04:21.367
-What's your name?

04:21.400 --> 04:22.600
-I can barely breathe.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.267
Well, if you're speaking,
you're breathing.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.667
So you're definitely
talking to me.

04:25.700 --> 04:26.700
-It's Aaron.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.300
-Okay, you got him?

04:28.333 --> 04:30.067
Oh, well, I got your wallet.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.433
I guess I don't really need
to know what your name is
right now.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.433
But I tell you,
if you needed to rest,

04:35.467 --> 04:38.400
the time to rest is when two
uniformed guys are chasing you.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.067
That's a good time to lay down
and take a break.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.067
-I ain't sitting, bro.
I was scared.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.800
-(radio chatter)

04:44.833 --> 04:47.067
-He's soaking wet. He was
in the drink at some point.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.067
-Someone tell me why
I'm being chased, please?

04:49.067 --> 04:51.167
-Why'd you run?
-Because I saw y'all chasing me.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.633
I'm not gonna lie, bro.
-We don't chase unless you run.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.133
-Right, but y'all was--
-We can't--

04:55.167 --> 04:56.767
We don't just chase people
unless they run.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.133
-I don't know why
y'all was chasing me.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.600
-No, that's what I'm saying,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.367
yeah, why did you run?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.233
-It was like
an instinct, bro.
-An instinct?

05:03.267 --> 05:04.867
-I just run.
I was scared, bro.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.100
Didn't know what to do.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.700
-Did you drop anything
while you were running?

05:07.733 --> 05:09.967
-I swear to god, I feel like
I'm gonna fall down.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.167
I need to rest.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.900
-Sarge, there was a call
of shots fired.
-Right.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.867
-They go to make contact
with him,

05:14.900 --> 05:16.867
and whew, there he goes.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.133
-Hey, listen. Listen up.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.633
Yo, you listening to me?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.067
Okay? Here's the problem.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.467
If a little kid
finds that gun,

05:22.500 --> 05:24.167
okay, and somebody gets injured,

05:24.200 --> 05:26.333
you're gonna have a major
problem. You understand
what I'm saying?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.933
-(mumbling)
-If a kid gets hurt

05:27.967 --> 05:29.633
because they find a weapon
that you threw,

05:29.667 --> 05:32.300
or you disregarded--
you threw on the ground,
you understand?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.267
So you're better off letting us
know where the weapon is.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.533
-I don't know!

05:35.567 --> 05:36.767
-You don't know
where you dropped it?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.433
-Bro, I don't know where
no weapon is.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.900
I never had a weapon.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.433
I never had a (bleep) weapon.

05:41.467 --> 05:44.133
-You were identified as
a suspect shooting a gun.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.433
-I don't know why.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.300
-You understand what I said
about the kid, right?

05:47.333 --> 05:50.133
If a little child finds
the weapon, you're gonna
have a problem.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.800
You get charged with murder
if the kid gets hurt?
Understand that?

05:52.833 --> 05:54.267
-Yes, sir.
I understand that.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.400
-So you're better off giving us
an idea of where the weapon is.

05:56.433 --> 05:57.567
-I can't talk to that.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.800
-Where you toss it?

05:58.833 --> 06:00.067
-I just want a lawyer, bro.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.067
-Where did you toss the gun?

06:01.100 --> 06:02.600
-I want a lawyer.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.200
-So you're gonna
take that chance?

06:04.233 --> 06:05.233
-A lawyer for what?

06:05.267 --> 06:06.567
-You didn't do nothing
wrong, I thought?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.867
-I know, but I still
need a lawyer.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.633
-Hey, listen, you gotta help us
try to find the weapon.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.633
You understand?
You gotta help us.
-Yeah.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.267
Okay? You're gonna help
yourself by doing this.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.500
Right, we don't want nobody else
to get hurt, you understand?

06:15.533 --> 06:17.100
So far nobody is hurt.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.300
You know?
-Yes.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.367
-Nobody's shot,
nobody's hurt, okay?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.533
-Yes.
-Understand?

06:21.567 --> 06:23.533
You need to let us know
where you put the weapon.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.667
-Why you guys keep saying--
-Where'd you drop it?

06:25.700 --> 06:27.333
-Why you guys keep
saying me?

06:27.367 --> 06:30.067
-People saw you.
They saw you with the gun.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.367
They saw you.
They identified you.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.233
Okay? It's real simple.

06:34.267 --> 06:37.167
We just don't want nobody else
to get hurt. Okay?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.267
-If I have any--
-Where'd you put it,
the back yard?

06:39.300 --> 06:40.467
In the garbage can?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.267
-He was in the water
at some point, he's soaked.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.067
-By the bridge?
-I'm trying! I don't understand.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.433
I didn't see that.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.067
You know where
this happened at?

06:48.067 --> 06:50.233
-Yeah.
-This happened up there.

06:50.267 --> 06:53.867
After this happened,
they shot down this way.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.233
-So the gun
is by the bridge, right?

06:55.267 --> 06:56.933
-So, if I was to go
with a guess,

06:56.967 --> 06:59.067
I would say that the gun
is maybe by the water.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.933
-All right. Good.
-Put him in the car?

07:00.967 --> 07:03.900
-All right. You're gonna be
charged with aggravated assault,

07:03.933 --> 07:05.733
possession of a weapon
for an unlawful purpose,

07:05.767 --> 07:07.767
resisting arrest,
and criminal mischief.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.500
And that should be it.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.300
-So, I got out of the military
in 2001,

07:15.333 --> 07:17.067
moved to Las Vegas.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.933
Joined the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department
in 2007.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.633
I love the job.
Every day is different.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.667
I get to interact
with different people,

07:26.700 --> 07:28.433
different personalities
every day.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.067
I like to be able to just
interact with the public

07:31.067 --> 07:33.167
and be able to assist them

07:33.200 --> 07:35.933
and being able to take some of
these criminals off the street.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.367
I'm showing up on a call

07:39.400 --> 07:42.333
where a victim's found
a suspect

07:42.367 --> 07:44.700
inside his vehicle
attempting to steal it.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.933
Another unit's already
arrived on scene

07:46.967 --> 07:48.567
and he's got him detained.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.300
So we're about to arrive here

07:50.333 --> 07:52.467
and see what we can
do to assist.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.500
Hey, Felix. What you got, bud?

08:05.533 --> 08:08.733
-Got him in custody
and he seems very drunk.

08:08.767 --> 08:11.633
-You know where
the victim's at, Felix?
-Right there.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.233
-Yeah, he broke the lock on it.

08:13.267 --> 08:15.567
-Let me talk to you
over here, sir.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.367
Hi, sir, Officer Anders,
Metro Police.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.167
-How you doing?
-So, what'd you see?

08:19.200 --> 08:22.300
-Me and my daughter
were coming-- Get over here.

08:22.333 --> 08:26.267
And my son.
We were coming down getting
ready to go to dinner.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.967
-Uh-huh.
-I come and hear
the car starting,

08:29.067 --> 08:30.400
I'm like, "what the heck?"

08:30.433 --> 08:32.167
-He's sitting inside--
-You hear the car starting?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.900
-Yeah. He's sitting
inside the car.
-Okay.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.067
-I run over there, it's like,
"Dude, what are you doing?"

08:36.100 --> 08:37.733
-Right.
-And he's like,

08:37.767 --> 08:39.900
"Oh, I thought it was
my girlfriend's car."

08:39.933 --> 08:41.500
-Uh-huh.
-And then,

08:41.533 --> 08:42.967
I had a screwdriver in there

08:43.067 --> 08:45.167
'cause I work on the car
from time to time--

08:45.200 --> 08:47.433
-You have a screwdriver
already in the vehicle?

08:47.467 --> 08:49.567
-Yeah, there was a screwdriver
sitting in there.
-I took it out.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.167
-It's in my pocket.
-Yeah, it's in that pocket.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.267
-That's all right.
-Yeah, but you can see
right where he put it.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.600
-He slammed the screwdriver in
and broke the lock.
-Oh, okay.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.433
'Cause I went to see if
it would lock again.
-Okay.

08:57.467 --> 09:00.233
You don't normally use that
to start your vehicle?

09:00.267 --> 09:01.300
-No, I have the key.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.433
-Okay. All right.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.967
-Now you can turn it
with your fingers,

09:04.067 --> 09:05.333
but it doesn't start.
-Okay.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.133
-But now I can't turn it back--
-And you're...

09:07.167 --> 09:09.067
the registered owner
of the vehicle?
-Yes, sir.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.733
-Okay. So he was in
the driver's side?

09:11.767 --> 09:12.767
-Yeah.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.200
-Sitting inside the vehicle?

09:14.233 --> 09:16.300
Or kinda reaching in?
-No, he was inside the vehicle.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.800
He was getting ready to go.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.167
-And the vehicle
was running already?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.533
-Yeah, it was already running.
-Okay.

09:20.567 --> 09:21.900
All right.

09:21.933 --> 09:24.433
-I swear, it was
my sister's vehicle.

09:24.467 --> 09:25.933
She has one just like it, man.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.467
-Your name's Daniel?
-Yes, sir.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.533
-Okay. Hi, Daniel.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.833
I'm Officer Anders.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.933
-Yes, sir, I went to park
my sister's car,

09:31.967 --> 09:35.400
and I-- actually,
it was her car.

09:35.433 --> 09:38.533
But I must
have taken the wrong car.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.100
'Cause the keys fit it.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.667
-How'd you start the vehicle?

09:42.700 --> 09:47.300
-Ignition. Like, my key
started her ignition.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.067
-The key started the ignition?
-Yes.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.733
-Where's the key at?

09:50.767 --> 09:53.167
-Uh, it's in my pocket.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.467
-It's in your pocket?
-Yeah.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.067
-Okay. You mind if I get that?

09:56.067 --> 09:57.233
-Yes, sir, go ahead.
-Which one?

09:58.833 --> 10:00.433
I don't see no keys
there, buddy.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.967
-No, in this pocket, yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.800
-Well, you don't have a key.
Is it in your back pocket?

10:09.833 --> 10:11.500
-No, it might be.
I don't know.

10:11.533 --> 10:14.100
It's in the ca-- It's in
the hou-- apartment, actually.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.500
-It's in the apartment?
-Yeah.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.200
-So, but I don't understand.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.233
You said you started
the vehicle with the key.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.867
But now the key's
in the apartment.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.867
But you're in the vehicle,
and you said you started
the car with the key.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.300
-Yeah.
-So which is it?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.467
-Well, it had a key with it.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
-It had a key with it?

10:28.533 --> 10:30.367
-Yeah.
-Okay. All right.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.833
Have you ever been arrested
for stealing a car before?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.233
-Never, dude.
-Never?

10:35.267 --> 10:36.733
-I've never done that.
-Okay.

10:36.767 --> 10:39.000
-I thought it was my sister's
car, I swear to god.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.967
-Okay, well, at this time,
you're under arrest.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.467
Grand larceny auto, okay?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.167
-Why?
-Yup.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.833
So, why?

10:46.867 --> 10:49.600
Because you were found inside
another gentleman's vehicle.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.000
-I didn't know it was hers.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.533
-I thought it was
my sister's.
-Screwdriver--

10:52.567 --> 10:54.200
A screwdriver
was in the ignition.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.633
-No, I thought
it was my sister's.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.167
-Vehicle is running.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.733
Your story isn't consistent.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.367
-I thought it was my sister's.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.200
-Okay. Let's go ahead
and stand up for me.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.367
Stand up.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.967
Stand up for me.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.233
-Oww, come on.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.067
-Dude, you gotta stand up.
I'm not gonna pick you up.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.567
-I know.
I know you aren't.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.833
-Come on.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.367
Get your legs under you.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.867
There you go.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.733
All right. Come back over
here to this vehicle.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.633
I'm gonna take some photos
of this ignition

11:22.667 --> 11:24.167
that's been tampered with.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.400
Um, you can see right here

11:26.433 --> 11:28.633
the scratches
on the ignition

11:28.667 --> 11:31.367
where the screwdriver
hit it a few times,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.200
and you can see the damage
to the ignition.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.400
According to the victim,

11:34.433 --> 11:36.300
this damage
was not there before.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.467
Hey, Daniel?

11:40.500 --> 11:43.700
Um, all right. So...

11:43.733 --> 11:46.867
You said you were trying
to start the vehicle with
the key, right?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.233
-No, I didn't.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.367
-I'm sorry?

11:49.400 --> 11:50.833
-I didn't.
-You didn't?

11:50.867 --> 11:52.533
-No.
-You didn't just tell me
a few minutes ago

11:52.567 --> 11:54.700
you were trying to start
the vehicle with the key?

11:54.733 --> 11:56.800
-No, I didn't have the key
in the vehicle.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.400
-Um, I've got a witness

11:58.433 --> 12:01.067
that saw you
in the driver's seat,

12:01.100 --> 12:03.667
and that you had used
a screwdriver

12:03.700 --> 12:05.633
to start the vehicle.

12:05.667 --> 12:06.733
-Oh, no, no.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.133
-No?
-No.

12:08.167 --> 12:09.833
-Okay.
-That's false.

12:09.867 --> 12:13.300
-That's false? But you're
saying you started the vehicle
with the key?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.633
But we can't find that key.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.100
-It's in my pocket, maybe.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.700
-Okay, we checked your pockets.
You don't have a key.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.067
-It's not in the car.
I wasn't driving.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.900
-And whose vehicle
is that again?

12:26.933 --> 12:28.567
-That's my vehicle.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.733
-That's your vehicle?

12:29.767 --> 12:31.933
Earlier you said
it was your sister's vehicle.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.367
Now it's your vehicle?

12:33.400 --> 12:34.600
-No, no, no.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.933
-So, your story's
not making sense,

12:35.967 --> 12:37.867
you're kind of
all over the place.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.567
Right, I just wanna let
you know, Daniel,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.700
you're under arrest for
attempted grand larceny auto.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.067
-Okay?
-Really?

12:45.067 --> 12:46.967
-You'll be booked down at
Clark County Detention Center.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.633
All right? Where you'll probably
spend at least an evening.

12:49.667 --> 12:50.667
All right?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.067
Well, hey, I'm really
glad that you called.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.367
I'm glad it didn't
escalate to violence.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.067
You kept an eye
on the individual,

13:03.067 --> 13:04.567
you didn't engage him in

13:04.600 --> 13:06.533
any kind of physical
confrontation,

13:06.567 --> 13:08.833
and you called us,
we got the bad guy.

13:08.867 --> 13:12.600
He's gonna go to jail today for
attempted grand larceny auto.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.600
And I'm glad we were able
to stop this before

13:15.633 --> 13:18.133
he was able to drive
that vehicle while intoxicated.

13:18.167 --> 13:19.733
Stolen vehicle at that.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.933
'Cause he could have easily
hurt somebody seriously.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.300
-Oh, yeah.
-Thank you so much.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.900
-All right. Thank you sir.
I appreciate it.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.267
-You make my job easier, Frank.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.967
-Thanks. All right.
-All right, thank you.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.967
-Tonight we're going to be
conducting undercover
room operations

13:34.067 --> 13:36.100
at one of the casino properties

13:36.133 --> 13:38.700
where we're going to have
several undercover detectives

13:38.733 --> 13:41.067
work the casino floor

13:41.100 --> 13:43.700
and out in front of
the local casinos.

13:43.733 --> 13:47.600
They're gonna try to get either
the deal downstairs,

13:47.633 --> 13:50.133
or bring the girls
up to the room

13:50.167 --> 13:52.500
and confirm a deal while
inside the room.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.833
Once we get the deal,

13:53.867 --> 13:56.600
we'll have PSU detectives,

13:56.633 --> 14:00.600
who are assigned to the local
area command out here,

14:00.633 --> 14:03.333
enter the room and take
the females into custody.

14:03.367 --> 14:06.733
All right. Supposedly the UCs
gonna be on his way up
right now.

14:06.767 --> 14:11.067
Should be here shortly with--
supposedly got two girls.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.400
Unknown if he got
the deal already.

14:13.433 --> 14:17.433
We'll just wait for him and see
what happens in the room.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.067
-(women chattering)

14:23.133 --> 14:25.100
-Can I just say--
Oh, my gosh!

14:25.133 --> 14:26.233
-Man:
Welcome.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.967
-You haven't even been
drinking the--

14:28.067 --> 14:30.133
Everybody's been drinking
the vodka.

14:30.167 --> 14:31.867
-Wait, listen.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.367
You gotta admit they're a little
suspicious, those guys.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.300
-Okay.
-They like those fruity vodkas.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.833
-She almost looks familiar,
the black female.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.200
-Repeat offender?
-Yeah.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.533
-I come in twos.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.133
-Huh?
-You come in twos, right?

14:45.167 --> 14:46.467
-Look what you did!

14:46.500 --> 14:48.167
-I didn't put my
feet on the bed.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.733
-Now you have to pay for it.
-I did not do that.

14:50.767 --> 14:51.867
-Work your brain.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.767
You kept saying
"drinks at the room."

14:53.800 --> 14:55.100
-Well, I gotta say something.
-Cheers!

14:55.133 --> 14:56.733
-Anything to get
you two up here.

14:56.767 --> 14:57.900
-Cheers!

14:57.933 --> 14:59.567
-Now that we're up here.
-What are we cheering?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.367
-Okay, well, first we're
cheering to a good night.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.600
Now we're cheering to...

15:04.067 --> 15:05.300
Even better night.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.567
-Good sex.
-You read my mind.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.967
-Oh, is that what
you're up to?

15:08.067 --> 15:09.400
-Even better mind.
-I hope so.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.167
-Is that what you're up to?
-An even better night.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.900
-Sometimes the girls--

15:12.933 --> 15:15.100
Some of these girls take
a little longer than others

15:15.133 --> 15:17.533
'cause they'll screen you
while they're in the room.

15:17.567 --> 15:18.967
-You don't think
that we're good?

15:19.067 --> 15:20.500
-Well, I don't know.
I'm gonna find out.

15:20.533 --> 15:21.600
-Yeah, but you gotta--

15:21.633 --> 15:24.767
-You just need to get comfy
with us and relax.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.500
You haven't even
taken a shot.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.233
-How much do I need for this?

15:30.267 --> 15:31.533
-Okay, so what
are you thinking?

15:31.567 --> 15:33.067
-Looking for fun.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.733
-Don't be messing with
my friend's calling cards.
-What fun.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.267
-Are you gonna put
your pajamas on?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.400
-They're just talking.
-You don't like shoes at all.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.067
-That's how
they were downstairs?

15:41.067 --> 15:42.200
-Yes.
-(sighs)

15:42.233 --> 15:44.200
-I'm looking for my money

15:44.233 --> 15:46.267
that I'm worried
my friends took.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.267
-So you don't have payment?

15:48.300 --> 15:49.833
-Well, I don't know.
How much is it gonna be?

15:49.867 --> 15:51.333
I might have to run downstairs.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.600
Can you guys tell me?

15:52.633 --> 15:54.767
-Okay, well, why don't you--
-Is four enough?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.533
-Um, can you do six?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.867
-A piece or total?
-Total.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.900
-600?
-At least, yeah.

16:00.933 --> 16:04.500
'Cause I mean, I want
to say five, but I mean--

16:04.533 --> 16:06.533
-He's like, "six?!"

16:06.567 --> 16:08.933
-I can do 600, but--
-He's like, "six?!"

16:08.967 --> 16:10.167
-You guys wait here, okay?

16:10.200 --> 16:14.200
I mean, 600 is basically
the payment on my Prius.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.233
-Okay. All right.
Let's go in.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.733
-You're making me
feel like 500's not fair.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.733
-He got the deal down, so...

16:19.767 --> 16:21.367
we're gonna send
everybody in now

16:21.400 --> 16:22.633
and grab the two girls.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.200
-So, can you do,
like, four-four?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.300
Or can you do three-three?
-No. We already did three.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.500
You guys can't start talking
to me 'cause I agree on that.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.133
-What's up?
-Hey.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.400
-What you guys doing?

16:32.433 --> 16:33.533
-Nothing, chilling.

16:33.567 --> 16:34.633
-Oh, right. Chilling?

16:34.667 --> 16:36.067
-Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
-Yeah?

16:36.067 --> 16:37.433
-Come on. Why don't you
guys come with me.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.500
-Okay.
-Go and stand up.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.100
-Just put that in there.
-Okay.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.967
-Go and grab your shoes.
-Okay.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.933
-How you ladies doing tonight?
-I'm cool.

16:43.967 --> 16:44.967
-All right.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.467
How long you guys
been out tonight?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.233
Whassup, blondie?

16:48.267 --> 16:50.533
-Hello.
-How you doing?
How old are you, girl?

16:50.567 --> 16:51.967
-Huh?
-How old are you?

16:52.067 --> 16:53.567
-Oh, I know where my--

16:53.600 --> 16:56.100
-Put my Cheetos down!

16:56.133 --> 16:57.933
-No! These are mine now.
-Those are my Cheetos.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.833
-I'm taking these. I'm sorry.
-No, no. No. I left them--

16:59.867 --> 17:01.467
I left those in here
for a reason.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.167
-I'll just take them.
-No, no. One more.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.633
Leave 'em here.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.133
Wait.
-He's got it.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.267
All right.
Let's go ladies.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.433
You guys are
gonna walk this way.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.167
Hey, you got anything
in your bra?
-No.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.133
-You don't? What about you?
You have anything in your bra?

17:12.167 --> 17:13.833
-No.
-Okay, listen. We're gonna
check to make sure.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.200
Double-check you don't
have anything.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.133
Go ahead. Stand right
by that mirror.

17:17.167 --> 17:18.767
Turn and face the mirror.
Go and give me that.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.133
-Oh, yeah. That's mine.
-Let me see that.

17:20.167 --> 17:21.833
Place your hands
behind your back.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.967
You have nothing in
your bra, correct?
-No.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.333
-Okay. What's this?

17:25.367 --> 17:26.433
-Nothing.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.233
-Is that the bra wire?

17:28.267 --> 17:29.667
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.767
All right. I want you guys
to change places for me.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.233
-Okay.
-Step over here.

17:33.267 --> 17:35.300
Hey, you didn't tell me
how old you were, blondie.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.467
-I'm 22.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.633
-22?
-Yes.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.300
-How old are you, young lady?

17:39.333 --> 17:40.333
-27.

17:40.367 --> 17:41.733
-27?
-Mm-hmm.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.633
-What's your first name?
-Cecily.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.267
-Cecily. Where you from, Cecily?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.400
-San Francisco.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.733
-Your first time here in Vegas?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.067
-Second.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.367
-Second time?
How long-- How long
have you known her?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.467
I've known her for a long time,
how you know her?

17:53.500 --> 17:54.767
-Oh, have you?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.933
-(laughing)
-Well, I've talked to--

17:56.967 --> 17:58.967
I've talked to you before.
I take that back.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.800
-Oh, my god.
-I've talked to her
a couple of times.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.267
So how you know her?

18:02.300 --> 18:03.967
-She's my friend.
-She's your friend?

18:04.067 --> 18:06.333
-I just met her.
-Walking down the strip?

18:06.367 --> 18:07.733
-I just met her.
-Oh, uh-huh.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.767
How your know-- Okay, you gonna
talk to my partner.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.233
-(laughing)
-All right.

18:11.267 --> 18:12.600
Come on in here.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.300
-Look at yourself.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.733
-You guys know the deal.

18:16.767 --> 18:21.067
You are both getting arrested
for soliciting prostitution.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.400
We're gonna be going down
to the jail in a second

18:23.433 --> 18:25.300
and transporting all
of you guys down, okay?

18:25.333 --> 18:26.633
So hang tight a second.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.433
I think there's another group
that's coming in here.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.267
So make room.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.767
-I'm going to jail?

18:32.800 --> 18:34.933
-Everybody's going to jail.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.867
-For what?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.800
-For soliciting
prostitution today.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.233
-I ain't solicitating (bleep)!

18:42.267 --> 18:43.700
-Okay, well...

18:43.733 --> 18:45.433
-This-- I cannot be.

18:45.467 --> 18:49.067
Dude, I can't sit in no jail!
-Relax.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.200
-For nothing!

18:50.233 --> 18:52.133
-All right, relax.
-I cannot!

18:52.167 --> 18:55.667
I refuse,
I ain't did (bleep)!

18:55.700 --> 19:00.333
I cannot relax!
I cannot breathe!

19:00.367 --> 19:05.367
I'm not going to jail
for nothing that I did not do!

19:05.400 --> 19:07.200
-Okay, listen. Stop. Stop.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.267
-She's the only one
who's tripping in here.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.867
-Yes, 'cause I
ain't did (bleep)!

19:10.900 --> 19:12.700
(yelling) Bitches!

19:12.733 --> 19:14.200
-Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.100
-Get out my face!
-Oh, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.800
Listen, listen.
-Get out of my face!

19:17.833 --> 19:19.767
-We can do this this way.
-Get out of my face!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.333
-Before we go
any farther, okay,

19:21.367 --> 19:23.267
I've been working
Las Vegas Boulevard
for a long time.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.733
Now my job is here not to judge
you for what's going on.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.900
But you do have
an issue here, okay?

19:27.933 --> 19:30.967
Don't make your issue and blow
it up, make it bigger than
what it is, all right?

19:31.067 --> 19:32.800
Right now, your issue
is very simple.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.067
These girls in here
are in for the same thing.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.333
Go through
the process, all right?

19:37.367 --> 19:40.467
You want to complain,
scream and yell
about the charges?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.433
You do that in court.
This is not the place for it.

19:42.467 --> 19:45.067
Nobody's trying to be
disrespectful to you, all right?

19:45.067 --> 19:46.300
So just give it some time,

19:46.333 --> 19:48.167
we'll try and figure this out
and get you out of here.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
All right?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.567
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.533
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.567 --> 19:55.700
Cover is code three.

19:55.733 --> 19:58.700
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.667 --> 20:06.633
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.833
-(theme music playing)
