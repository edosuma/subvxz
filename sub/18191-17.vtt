WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.667
Please don't interrupt my session.

00:02.727 --> 00:04.761
If we're gonna share this
office, I need some respect too.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.276
Is she crazy?! What's wrong with her?

00:07.074 --> 00:09.609
I take prescription drugs

00:09.643 --> 00:11.943
for anxiety and depression.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.613
I wanted to see what were to happen

00:13.647 --> 00:14.767
if I were to go off of them.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.015
I'm getting the scoop on Richie Miranda.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.718
His contract's up soon.
I'm hearing trade rumors.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.586
Richie's hiding in the V.I.P. area.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.623
You have some more of that stuff?

00:23.657 --> 00:24.724
Don't act like I'm uptight if I'm not cool

00:24.758 --> 00:25.758
with my boyfriend

00:25.792 --> 00:27.493
snorting drugs into his brain!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.662
If we weren't both sick, would
we still even want to together?!

00:29.696 --> 00:30.930
So I went to this club last night

00:30.964 --> 00:33.599
to interview Richie Miranda.
He's doing drugs again.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.468
This is the job you signed up for.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.570
This could really screw up his life.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.438
And his last drug test had come in clean,

00:39.473 --> 00:41.574
but given this new allegation
by the "Boston Post,"

00:41.608 --> 00:43.776
he will be tested again.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.711
- How's it feel to make news?
- It feels...

00:45.746 --> 00:47.380
Fricking great! That's how.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.622
How's it going today, John? The usual?

00:56.657 --> 00:59.425
Here you go.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.660
- Latte, please.
- Coming right up.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.261
Thank you.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.531
"April Carver."

01:05.566 --> 01:07.433
- Do you need I.D.?
- You're the April Carver

01:07.467 --> 01:08.634
that writes for the "Post," huh?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.436
Yeah, wow, I didn't think

01:10.470 --> 01:11.504
people paid attention to names

01:11.538 --> 01:12.538
of writers in newspapers.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.307
Thank you so much for saying something.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.409
You're the one trying to bring
down my man Richie Miranda.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.344
If he fails that drug test,
he's gonna get suspended.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.378
Thanks for nothing.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.080
- Excuse me?
- Fact is,

01:21.114 --> 01:22.515
the guy shouldn't be playing
ball if he's a coke head.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.784
Well, no Richie means no
World Series for the Sox.

01:24.790 --> 01:27.125
You know what that means? No coffee.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.455
I'm... sorry.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.157
You are refusing to serve me

01:31.191 --> 01:32.992
because I wrote an article
reporting the truth?

01:33.026 --> 01:35.895
- I don't serve traitors.
- This is ridiculous.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.964
- I'm filing a complaint.
- Of course you are,

01:37.998 --> 01:39.065
'cause you're a nark.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.099
Next.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.237
- Regular.
- Ugh!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.940
♪ you bet your soul, honey ♪

01:47.975 --> 01:50.343
♪ You bet your soul ♪

02:05.292 --> 02:07.260
I am so jealous you got recognized

02:07.294 --> 02:08.894
as a journalist.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.963
Seriously, do you know how
hard that is these days?

02:10.997 --> 02:12.898
Unless you started Wikileaks...

02:12.933 --> 02:15.001
Yeah, well, I can see why
that guy went into exile.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.202
Persecution sucks.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.903
Uh-oh, backlash from the article?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.205
Mm-hmm.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.173
Oh, I'd stay away from that fake creamer.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.942
That stuff is supposed to like...

02:22.976 --> 02:25.244
Cause cancer? Yeah, already had that.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.079
You're not regretting

02:27.114 --> 02:28.381
writing the article, are you?

02:28.415 --> 02:31.217
No way. I mean, I was doing my job.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.219
And, yeah, part of me feels bad

02:33.253 --> 02:34.920
that Richie might get suspended,

02:34.955 --> 02:36.322
but he did do coke.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.391
And I would've regretted
not writing it way more.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.159
Well, good, just remember that

02:40.193 --> 02:42.194
in about five seconds.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.397
"Boston4eva" writes,

02:44.431 --> 02:46.132
"Bill Buckner and April Carver,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.867
two people in this town that make me think

02:47.868 --> 02:50.236
the Salem witch trials
weren't such a bad idea.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.004
See, I really like how he weaved in

02:52.039 --> 02:53.172
a little bit of local
history, and that's nice.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.341
- Who's Bill Buckner?
- Ugh! No, you didn't.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.343
And for not knowing that,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.211
I'm gonna go ahead and like this comment.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.080
You do that. And since you lost the bet,

03:01.114 --> 03:02.314
you will have plenty more time

03:02.316 --> 03:05.051
to surf blogs and Facebook
pages while you're waiting

03:05.085 --> 03:06.352
in line to get me tacos.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.962
Yeah, you kind of looked
like a "My Little Pony"

03:16.997 --> 03:19.298
- with the purple hair.
- That's what I was going for.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.970
So how are you feeling?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.039
Oh, like a million times better.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.374
And thank God

03:28.408 --> 03:30.309
you and Kieran stopped
me from getting a tattoo.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.978
I have no idea what I was thinking.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.981
Are you like back on your meds now?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.017
- Or...
- No, but I'm fine.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.385
I think it was just a reaction

03:39.419 --> 03:42.154
to going off of them all
of a sudden, you know?

03:42.189 --> 03:44.990
So you're not taking them at all anymore?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.326
I don't know. I'll see how I feel.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.962
Do you think your parents will notice?

03:49.996 --> 03:52.264
Between golf
games and dinner parties,

03:52.299 --> 03:53.366
I highly doubt it.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.969
I have a present for you.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.105
- What?
- I think you're gonna love it.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.279
It's the same one you saw

04:07.314 --> 04:08.981
at that duty-free store in Florida,

04:09.015 --> 04:11.050
the one I had to like drag you away from.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.320
The one that cost like $300.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.089
Who cares?

04:17.124 --> 04:18.124
You like it, right?

04:18.158 --> 04:21.961
Yeah. Yeah, I love it.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.095
You sure?

04:25.298 --> 04:28.000
Full disclosure, I've
been stalking it online

04:28.034 --> 04:29.135
to see if it ever went on sale.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.369
- It didn't.
- I know.

04:34.408 --> 04:37.176
Wow, this place is amazing.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.344
Oh, and the best part

04:38.378 --> 04:40.146
was that when I gave my name at the door,

04:40.180 --> 04:42.148
not a single person seemed to recognize it.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.382
Yeah, I think you're safe here.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.985
I doubt anyone even knows
who Richie Miranda is.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.253
It's all girls and gays.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.321
Ooh, is this your boss's new line?

04:49.356 --> 04:52.091
Actually, this is my boss's dirty laundry.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.193
I'm Jaclyn's personal assistant.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.162
So I handle feeding her,

04:56.196 --> 04:59.331
managing her dry cleaning, walking her dog,

04:59.366 --> 05:00.933
unlike her first assistant.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.835
What's her first assistant do?

05:02.869 --> 05:06.005
Send selfies to her boyfriend.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.842
She only got this job because she claims

05:09.876 --> 05:11.243
to be Vera Wang's niece.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.180
The first assistant gets to
put together this preview party

05:14.214 --> 05:15.781
that we're hosting for some buyers.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.183
And she gets to do all the fun stuff.

05:17.217 --> 05:21.153
While my sole responsibility
is taking care of the food.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.088
So what's new with you?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.957
Have you talked to Leo yet?

05:24.991 --> 05:28.661
No,
not even sure I want to.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.963
I feel like I've just seen this

05:30.997 --> 05:33.766
scary new side of him and
I don't want that right now.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.768
You always knew he had an edge, right?

05:35.802 --> 05:38.037
I guess it just felt different before.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.673
You know, he hasn't really been the same

05:40.707 --> 05:41.841
since the surgery,

05:41.875 --> 05:44.610
and maybe I haven't either.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.748
April...

05:49.783 --> 05:51.984
Could you please pass the traitor...

05:52.018 --> 05:53.652
I mean, the salt?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.822
Thank you. I'll take a little more

05:56.857 --> 05:58.624
of the backstab salad.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.794
- Grandma.
- What is going on?

06:01.828 --> 06:05.664
Pearl and I had a little
wager this week on the Sox.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.765
Now it looks like I'm gonna lose.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.767
Oh, mom, don't make April feel bad.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.736
- No, it's fine.
- Hey, um...

06:10.770 --> 06:12.705
Grandma, do you mind
passing the sore loser?

06:14.641 --> 06:16.308
Hey, so tell us about the reunion.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.576
I've been dying to hear all about it.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.346
Oh, it was fine.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.714
Just fine? It looked
like you were having fun

06:21.748 --> 06:23.349
in the pictures you posted.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.217
I really have to change
my privacy settings.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.519
Come on, tell us.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.387
Mmm... .

06:28.421 --> 06:30.623
I really don't have any stories.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.192
I don't even remember what we did, really.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.494
You don't remember? You just got back.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.397
Mm, oh, good! Brenna's home!

06:38.431 --> 06:39.598
Hi.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.267
Brenna's home late.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.501
I know, I'm sorry.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.303
Kieran called last minute.
They were short-staffed.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.372
- So I filled in.
- Next time, let me know, please.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.340
- Okay, sorry.
- Uh, Brenna.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.076
Come with me. I need
your help on the computer.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.012
You still haven't told
us about the reunion.

06:53.046 --> 06:58.017
How do you change who can
and can't see your photos?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.987
And coming up next in the 8:00 hour,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.923
Red Sox player Richie Miranda

07:03.957 --> 07:06.091
breaks his silence after the "Boston Post"

07:06.126 --> 07:07.860
reported a story yesterday

07:07.894 --> 07:09.214
alleging that he is off the wagon.

07:09.229 --> 07:13.065
We will release that statement
exclusively, after the break.

07:13.099 --> 07:17.102
Good morning, Danny and
"Good Morning America."

07:17.137 --> 07:18.904
Okay.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.774
Can you believe they're talking
about my story on G.M.A.?

07:21.808 --> 07:24.209
I'm like making news. I'm a news-maker.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.045
Good to see you're staying grounded.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.747
Going camping?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.883
Nope. I slept here.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.085
My daily commute's an hour and 47 minutes.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.853
So if I sleep here twice a week,

07:34.888 --> 07:35.955
by the end of the month,

07:35.989 --> 07:37.690
I'll have a two-day lead on everyone else.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.924
Oh, hey, turn it up.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.895
Miranda's statement is as follows,

07:42.929 --> 07:44.063
"I am shocked and saddened

07:44.097 --> 07:45.998
by the inaccurate and slanderous story

07:46.032 --> 07:47.833
published by the 'Boston Post.'

07:47.867 --> 07:49.868
I take my sobriety very seriously

07:49.903 --> 07:52.605
and will do whatever it takes
to set the record straight.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.573
The fact is, I have not used

07:54.574 --> 07:56.808
illegal drugs of any
kind since leaving rehab."

07:58.778 --> 08:01.513
Yeah, you're definitely making news.

08:07.852 --> 08:09.172
Madeline, I need to talk to Aaron.

08:09.187 --> 08:10.754
He's out of the office and unavailable.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.790
I get it, he's busy. He's always busy.

08:12.824 --> 08:13.984
This is about Richie Miranda.

08:13.992 --> 08:15.859
- He's saying that...
- I know, Aaron knows,

08:15.894 --> 08:17.861
and he's really unavailable, okay?

08:22.133 --> 08:23.734
This isn't good, Danny.

08:23.768 --> 08:25.703
It's basically my word against his.

08:25.737 --> 08:28.973
Well, was anyone
else there with you?

08:29.007 --> 08:30.608
To corroborate your story.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.710
- Yes.
- Who?

08:32.744 --> 08:33.744
Why?

08:33.745 --> 08:35.879
To corroborate your story.

08:39.683 --> 08:40.683
I can't say.

08:40.684 --> 08:41.684
If I pull them into this,

08:41.686 --> 08:42.846
they could get in trouble too.

08:42.854 --> 08:45.489
Well, you might get
into even bigger trouble.

08:45.523 --> 08:47.491
It's them or you.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.635
Do you think I
should mention Leo's name?

08:57.669 --> 08:59.470
I mean, if it comes down to it?

08:59.504 --> 09:01.472
Well, isn't a good
reporter supposed to, like,

09:01.506 --> 09:02.573
never reveal her sources?

09:02.607 --> 09:04.742
Even when said source
decided to go all '80s

09:04.776 --> 09:07.444
and do blow at an event
where I was working,

09:07.479 --> 09:09.513
and then have the nerve to get angry at me

09:09.547 --> 09:10.714
- for being pissed?!
- Okay.

09:10.749 --> 09:13.284
First, why don't we
step away from the knife?

09:13.318 --> 09:15.552
Okay, the strawberries
didn't do anything to you.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.421
- Fine,
- I'm gonna cut it.

09:19.424 --> 09:21.191
As much as I want to, I just can't

09:21.226 --> 09:22.359
drag him into this.

09:22.394 --> 09:23.634
Because you're falling for him?

09:25.630 --> 09:28.332
And now George Stephanopoulos
thinks I'm a liar.

09:28.366 --> 09:29.500
Hey, I doubt George Stephanopoulos

09:29.534 --> 09:31.368
has an opinion about you personally.

09:31.403 --> 09:33.370
But he might actually know who you are now.

09:33.405 --> 09:35.205
And he's so hot. That's a big deal.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.275
Right, most people your age
are cleaning their bosses cars,

09:38.310 --> 09:39.410
myself included.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.479
It's actually where I found...

09:42.514 --> 09:44.181
Myself this...

09:44.215 --> 09:45.482
- Ooh.
- Yup.

09:45.517 --> 09:47.351
- Is Jaclyn gonna notice?
- Oh, it was in a gift bag

09:47.385 --> 09:49.053
marked "2009."

09:49.087 --> 09:51.188
Well, I guess we can celebrate

09:51.222 --> 09:53.390
my first appearance on G.M.A.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.160
Actually, it's for me.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.996
Um, Jaclyn fired her first assistant today.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.364
What? You got promoted?

10:00.398 --> 10:02.132
No. No.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.168
Uh, Jaclyn doesn't think
I have enough experience

10:04.202 --> 10:05.969
to do Traci's job, but, see,

10:06.004 --> 10:06.970
I know if I can step up at this event,

10:07.005 --> 10:08.005
I can get her to change her mind.

10:08.039 --> 10:10.107
Well, how're you gonna do that?

10:10.141 --> 10:12.209
Okay, so Traci got fired
because she was meant

10:12.243 --> 10:14.244
to hire these models for the show.

10:14.279 --> 10:17.047
She screwed up the dates. And now
the girls we want aren't available.

10:17.082 --> 10:18.882
Jaclyn doesn't like
any of the other models.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.018
She keeps saying they
don't look like real teens.

10:21.052 --> 10:23.020
What should I do?

10:23.054 --> 10:25.756
Maybe hang out at the local high school

10:25.790 --> 10:27.950
and ask some real teen girls
if they want to be models.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.059
Uh...

10:29.094 --> 10:30.861
Well, it feels like it's just one step

10:30.895 --> 10:32.763
from luring little kids into a van.

10:32.797 --> 10:33.964
- So...
- A little bit.

10:33.998 --> 10:35.165
Mmm.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.802
I live with a real teen.

10:38.837 --> 10:41.638
Um, no.

10:41.673 --> 10:42.806
Come on. Come on.

10:42.841 --> 10:44.108
It's not like real modeling.

10:44.142 --> 10:45.809
There's no runway or anything.

10:45.844 --> 10:47.611
You just have to wear
the clothes for an hour

10:47.645 --> 10:50.848
- while buyers stare at you.
- Oh, yeah, in that case...

10:50.882 --> 10:52.649
Oh, come on, Bren. It'll be easy.

10:52.684 --> 10:54.952
Do I get to keep the clothes?

10:54.986 --> 10:55.986
Yes.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.590
Oh, look, look.

10:59.624 --> 11:01.825
I know I'm not doing like a great job

11:01.860 --> 11:04.595
of selling this, but I'm desperate, okay?

11:04.629 --> 11:05.629
And you'll save my life.

11:07.866 --> 11:09.867
Ugh! Fine, fine.

11:09.901 --> 11:12.603
Yes, do you think Ford'll do it too?

11:12.637 --> 11:14.405
Have you met Ford?

11:14.439 --> 11:17.374
Oh, Rebecca Minkoff? Nice.

11:17.409 --> 11:18.409
Where did you get that?

11:18.443 --> 11:19.610
Goodwill.

11:19.644 --> 11:21.445
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.479 --> 11:23.580
Okay, so Ford is out, but do you have

11:23.615 --> 11:25.549
any other friends that might want to model?

11:25.583 --> 11:27.618
Um, what about Greer?

11:27.652 --> 11:29.486
She's really into that stuff.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.355
Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome.

11:31.389 --> 11:32.556
Uh, wait, I thought mom said

11:32.590 --> 11:34.491
you guys weren't allowed
to see each other anymore.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.693
Can't they see each other just this once?

11:36.728 --> 11:39.196
It's not a big deal.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.198
I mean, we're just hanging out as friends.

11:41.232 --> 11:43.112
Don't tell mom though.
She just wouldn't get it.

11:44.436 --> 11:47.171
Come on, I've kept secrets for you before.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.373
One really big one in particular.

12:00.051 --> 12:03.220
Oh, if someone's parked
in your client-space again,

12:03.254 --> 12:05.355
it's not one of my
patients. No one here but me.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.958
No, they're not.

12:07.992 --> 12:09.993
- I just wanted to...
- Well, what?

12:10.028 --> 12:12.296
Do the plants in the
waiting room need watering?

12:12.330 --> 12:14.097
Is the bathroom out of T.P. again?

12:14.132 --> 12:15.966
Sara, stop.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.968
Everything's fine with the office,

12:18.002 --> 12:19.870
but I'm glad you assume the only reason

12:19.904 --> 12:21.305
I ever open my mouth is to
complain about something.

12:21.339 --> 12:24.308
I'm actually here with some good news.

12:24.342 --> 12:28.912
I got Aditi's visa extended
another three months.

12:28.947 --> 12:30.914
And I'm filing to get her a green card

12:30.949 --> 12:32.916
under the "family preference" category.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.819
Oh, that's great.

12:35.854 --> 12:37.888
Did you know that Malala Yousafzai

12:37.922 --> 12:39.022
is giving a speech at Harvard this week?

12:39.057 --> 12:40.991
Yeah, I did. I tried to get tickets.

12:41.025 --> 12:42.960
- They're sold out.
- Well, I got tickets

12:42.994 --> 12:44.761
with a friend...

12:44.796 --> 12:45.929
And he just bailed on me.

12:45.964 --> 12:48.699
So...

12:48.733 --> 12:49.933
You know...

12:49.968 --> 12:51.068
If you're interested?

12:51.102 --> 12:54.671
Yeah, that's... How much
do you want for them?

12:54.706 --> 12:56.874
No.

12:56.908 --> 13:00.577
I meant if you would want to come with me.

13:00.612 --> 13:02.813
Oh...

13:02.847 --> 13:04.515
'Kay, that... Yeah, that...

13:04.549 --> 13:06.683
I... sure, yes.

13:06.718 --> 13:07.718
That sounds fun.

13:07.719 --> 13:09.753
- Yeah. No.
- No.

13:09.787 --> 13:11.622
I'm sorry. God, no, not fun.

13:11.656 --> 13:14.558
What happened to that
poor girl was horrible.

13:14.592 --> 13:17.528
- Yeah.
- It'll be edifying.

13:17.562 --> 13:19.496
Exactly. It will definitely not be fun.

13:20.498 --> 13:21.498
Uh-uh.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.372
I'm starting to worry

13:28.406 --> 13:29.640
you don't actually have a place to live.

13:29.674 --> 13:31.475
I'm starting to worry

13:31.509 --> 13:33.277
that you're already four
hours behind me this week.

13:33.311 --> 13:34.611
April.

13:34.646 --> 13:37.414
Oh, finally. Can I talk to Aaron now?

13:37.448 --> 13:39.349
Ms. Callahan would like to see you.

13:39.384 --> 13:40.717
Ms. Callahan?

13:40.752 --> 13:42.519
The publisher of the paper?

13:42.554 --> 13:46.623
God, why are you so lucky?

13:46.658 --> 13:48.625
I mean, I know you had cancer and stuff,

13:48.660 --> 13:51.161
but still!

13:51.195 --> 13:53.497
April, she wants to see you now.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.445
Ms. Callahan.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.980
- I'm April...
- Richie Miranda

14:07.714 --> 14:09.582
- passed his drug test.
- What?!

14:09.616 --> 14:12.451
So explain to me why I
shouldn't fire you right now.

14:12.486 --> 14:15.288
Ma'am, if we could just invite
Aaron into this conversation,

14:15.322 --> 14:17.523
- he could...
- Aaron is gone. I fired him.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.326
This article should
never have been published

14:20.360 --> 14:22.361
without my consent!

14:22.396 --> 14:25.131
And now Miranda's people are suing us.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.433
So, again...

14:27.467 --> 14:30.536
Why shouldn't I fire you right now?

14:30.571 --> 14:32.471
I know what I saw.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.674
Richie is lying, I swear.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.468
I love my job and I take it very...

14:36.476 --> 14:38.277
And I love not being sued.

14:39.826 --> 14:42.795
They'll drop everything
if we print a retraction.

14:42.829 --> 14:45.764
And if we print a retraction of this scope,

14:45.799 --> 14:49.435
we fire the writer.

14:49.469 --> 14:50.703
Please don't fire me.

14:50.737 --> 14:53.272
I will... I will write a follow-up piece,

14:53.306 --> 14:55.374
- stand by my story.
- Not enough.

14:55.408 --> 14:57.610
I'll do an interview.

14:57.644 --> 15:00.646
Yeah, like, go on camera, defend myself,

15:00.680 --> 15:03.215
whatever it takes if you think it'll help.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.650
Well, this is on the national radar,

15:04.684 --> 15:08.153
so you'd need a national
on-camera interview.

15:09.522 --> 15:10.522
Asap.

15:13.293 --> 15:14.293
- Thank you.
- Oh, no.

15:14.327 --> 15:15.261
Don't thank me yet.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.463
Just get ready for it.

15:17.497 --> 15:19.365
We can't afford anymore mistakes.

15:25.372 --> 15:27.106
Aaron's gone?

15:28.208 --> 15:30.209
Damn it! He loved me.

15:30.243 --> 15:32.478
I was his D-dog.

15:32.512 --> 15:36.181
Well, focus, D-dog, or
I'm gonna be next to go.

15:36.216 --> 15:38.150
What was I thinking?

15:38.184 --> 15:40.219
I have to, like, speak for the "Post."

15:40.253 --> 15:43.222
I'm sure there's a way
you can get ready for this.

15:43.256 --> 15:45.190
What are you gonna look up?

15:45.225 --> 15:48.160
How to not lose your job and stay calm

15:48.194 --> 15:49.274
during a national interview

15:49.296 --> 15:50.396
where millions of people are watching,

15:50.430 --> 15:51.397
waiting for you to screw up,

15:51.431 --> 15:52.431
so they can post those screwups

15:52.465 --> 15:54.433
on the Internet until the end of time?!

15:54.467 --> 15:57.336
Yeah, it's not coming up in my search.

15:57.370 --> 16:01.073
Hey, what if you hire one
of those political coaches

16:01.107 --> 16:03.275
who help politicians get
ready for debates and stuff?

16:03.310 --> 16:04.350
With what money?

16:04.377 --> 16:06.078
I can barely afford coffee.

16:06.112 --> 16:07.379
Well, since you've been
blacklisted from the coffee cart,

16:07.414 --> 16:09.081
you probably have at
least five bucks saved.

16:09.115 --> 16:11.183
- Hilarious.
- I do know one person

16:11.217 --> 16:12.318
who could help.

16:12.352 --> 16:14.053
She has experience in TV news,

16:14.087 --> 16:15.254
so she'd know what question's they'll ask.

16:15.288 --> 16:18.324
She has the perfect sound
bite for any press situation,

16:18.358 --> 16:21.060
and she never lets her emotions
get in the way of anything.

16:21.094 --> 16:22.328
- You don't mean...
- Yeah.

16:22.362 --> 16:24.029
My future ex-wife.

16:25.965 --> 16:27.866
You busy right now?

16:27.901 --> 16:29.234
Am I asleep?

16:29.269 --> 16:31.070
No.

16:31.104 --> 16:33.305
Then you can assume I'm busy.

16:33.340 --> 16:36.975
Not sure if the news has
made it's way down to you,

16:37.010 --> 16:39.211
- but Aaron...
- Is fired, I know.

16:39.245 --> 16:41.046
Um, Ms. Callahan just told me.

16:41.081 --> 16:42.815
You met Karen Callahan?

16:42.849 --> 16:44.149
Yeah, she wanted to talk to me about

16:44.184 --> 16:45.984
the whole he-said
she-said situation.

16:46.019 --> 16:49.888
I told her I'd go on
camera and do an interview

16:49.923 --> 16:51.890
and I've never done one before.

16:51.925 --> 16:57.029
So I was wondering if maybe
you could help me prepare.

16:57.063 --> 16:59.965
You're really just so good at what you do.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.734
First rule of TV interviews:

17:01.768 --> 17:03.168
People can tell when you're being fake.

17:03.203 --> 17:05.904
I'm not being fake. I'm sucking up

17:05.939 --> 17:07.138
and desperate.

17:07.173 --> 17:09.074
But if you don't have time,

17:09.108 --> 17:10.742
I can always just tell Ms. Callahan

17:10.777 --> 17:12.017
that you were too busy to help.

17:14.848 --> 17:17.883
9:00 A.M. tomorrow, we start coaching.

17:17.916 --> 17:19.685
Thank you.

17:24.656 --> 17:26.892
I changed my mind about
wanting to keep the clothes.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.827
I know, I should win an Oscar

17:28.862 --> 17:30.062
for pretending to like them.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.830
These are awful.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.666
Please, look at you. You
can pull off anything.

17:34.701 --> 17:36.769
Oh, oh!

17:36.803 --> 17:38.837
How exquisite.

17:38.872 --> 17:40.973
I know, right? So gorgeous.

17:41.007 --> 17:42.841
Wait.

17:53.686 --> 17:55.721
Now that is...

17:55.755 --> 17:58.590
Exquisite?

17:58.625 --> 18:00.459
Clever.

18:00.493 --> 18:01.894
You remind me of my friend Gwen.

18:01.928 --> 18:03.729
She's always teasing me.

18:03.763 --> 18:05.697
Stefani.

18:05.732 --> 18:08.534
You are a doll.

18:08.568 --> 18:12.704
You just embody this line.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.574
You look like an angel in my dress.

18:15.608 --> 18:17.743
Now I designed this to represent

18:17.777 --> 18:19.578
the innocence of teens.

18:19.612 --> 18:22.381
So how would you feel

18:22.415 --> 18:24.616
about wearing the signature piece

18:24.651 --> 18:26.752
in my new line? You walk out last.

18:26.786 --> 18:28.787
My big finale.

18:28.822 --> 18:31.757
Okay.

18:31.791 --> 18:33.625
- Beth! Beth, great.
- Yeah.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.794
- Could you get me a soda?
- Sure.

18:35.829 --> 18:38.497
I know they're terrible for you.

18:38.531 --> 18:40.699
Annie is always telling me I need to stop.

18:40.733 --> 18:42.501
Hathaway.

18:42.535 --> 18:44.336
Can you make sure

18:44.370 --> 18:46.338
that there's a healthy option on the menu?

18:46.372 --> 18:47.639
Candace said that she might stop by.

18:47.674 --> 18:49.675
- Bushnell?
- Cameron-Bure.

18:52.278 --> 18:53.445
Right.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.280
Exquisite.

18:57.383 --> 18:58.650
What?

18:58.685 --> 19:01.253
Uh, I forgot the food.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.422
Oh, I have to warn you.

19:03.456 --> 19:05.657
I have trouble telling
some of these women apart.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.593
It's because they're all rich

19:07.627 --> 19:10.229
and have the same guy who does their noses.

19:10.263 --> 19:12.297
They ask for the "Charlize."

19:14.367 --> 19:16.301
I appreciate you
trying to help distract me.

19:16.336 --> 19:18.203
Well, it's really not right

19:18.238 --> 19:19.605
that you're even in this situation at work.

19:19.639 --> 19:22.608
I know, it totally sucks.

19:22.642 --> 19:25.444
You're being called a
liar when he did drugs.

19:25.478 --> 19:26.512
Yup.

19:26.546 --> 19:28.614
Now can we just chill out

19:28.648 --> 19:31.250
and watch grown women stab
each other in the back?

19:31.284 --> 19:33.218
Hmm.

19:33.253 --> 19:34.319
And they have the nerve to make you

19:34.354 --> 19:36.188
go on camera and defend yourself.

19:37.624 --> 19:39.391
Sorry, I'll stop.

19:39.425 --> 19:42.094
- Oh, no, she didn't!
- Hey, why aren't

19:42.128 --> 19:43.495
you out with Leo?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.197
Um...

19:45.231 --> 19:46.565
We, um...

19:46.599 --> 19:49.401
We kinda had a fight. He's
been all over the place.

19:49.435 --> 19:50.536
And I'm just starting to think

19:50.570 --> 19:53.138
that he's not boyfriend material after all.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.173
I'm always doing all the work.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.175
I'm sure it feels that way,

19:57.210 --> 19:58.377
but he is trying.

19:58.411 --> 20:00.112
How do you know?

20:02.215 --> 20:05.083
I don't think it would
be ethical for me to say.

20:05.118 --> 20:06.385
Ethical?

20:06.419 --> 20:08.120
Are you, like, counseling him?

20:08.154 --> 20:10.289
No, not officially, no.

20:10.323 --> 20:13.258
But, April, he's dealing
with a lot right now.

20:13.293 --> 20:16.428
You might just want to be
a little bit compassionate.

20:16.462 --> 20:19.097
Well, he's not making it easy.

20:19.132 --> 20:20.432
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:20.466 --> 20:23.068
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I just...

20:23.102 --> 20:26.071
I should rest up for my
training session tomorrow.

20:26.105 --> 20:29.141
Yeah, it is late. Why isn't grandma home?

20:29.175 --> 20:31.376
Oh, she's probably out
celebrating with Richie Miranda.

20:31.411 --> 20:33.979
Can I ask you something? Do you think...

20:34.013 --> 20:38.183
She has seemed a little off lately?

20:38.217 --> 20:40.919
Like forgetful?

20:40.954 --> 20:43.088
The last time we hung out with grandma,

20:43.122 --> 20:44.389
she was calling out all the answers

20:44.424 --> 20:47.025
to an entire round of Jeopardy, remember?

20:47.060 --> 20:48.393
It was really annoying.

20:48.428 --> 20:51.897
Yeah, you're right. I'm being paranoid.

20:51.931 --> 20:53.899
I'm probably the one who's losing it.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.300
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:01.107 --> 21:04.176
Sara! Are you trying me a heart attack?!

21:04.210 --> 21:06.111
Are you trying to give me one?!

21:06.145 --> 21:07.179
Why are you sneaking in?

21:07.213 --> 21:09.014
I wasn't sneaking in!

21:09.048 --> 21:10.215
Well, what's with the tiptoeing?

21:10.249 --> 21:12.150
Why didn't you turn on a light?

21:13.886 --> 21:15.120
Where were you?

21:15.154 --> 21:17.789
Book club.

21:17.824 --> 21:19.825
Dressed like that?!

21:19.859 --> 21:21.827
It was themed.

21:21.861 --> 21:25.864
We were reading a book
about the 'Roaring '20s'.

21:31.237 --> 21:32.771
What book?

21:32.805 --> 21:34.973
I can't remember.

21:35.008 --> 21:37.743
You know, book clubs,

21:37.777 --> 21:40.112
who even talks about the books?

21:40.146 --> 21:43.682
Mom, I would hope

21:43.716 --> 21:45.751
that if you're starting to feel a little

21:45.785 --> 21:48.053
not like yourself that you would tell me.

21:48.087 --> 21:51.023
Are you asking if I have Alzheimers?

21:51.057 --> 21:53.659
No, I just... I...

21:54.794 --> 21:55.794
I don't know.

21:55.795 --> 21:57.663
Don't you remember two nights ago,

21:57.697 --> 21:59.865
I dominated at Jeopardy.

21:59.899 --> 22:02.000
Yes, but I'm worried.

22:02.035 --> 22:04.569
Something is going on with you.

22:04.604 --> 22:06.838
My memory is fine,

22:06.873 --> 22:07.939
but if you must know,

22:07.974 --> 22:10.842
I'm dating someone.

22:10.877 --> 22:12.811
Goodnight.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.324
Did you have any alcohol the night

22:22.359 --> 22:24.426
you allegedly saw Richie
Miranda do cocaine?

22:24.461 --> 22:25.661
No, Richie was the only one...

22:25.695 --> 22:27.463
Stop! Start over.

22:27.497 --> 22:29.465
Don't call him Richie. He's not your buddy.

22:29.499 --> 22:32.601
Refer to him as "Mr.
Miranda" or use his full name.

22:32.635 --> 22:35.270
Okay, sorry.

22:35.305 --> 22:36.505
You were coherent enough
to say unequivocally that

22:36.539 --> 22:38.374
Richie Miranda was doing cocaine?

22:38.408 --> 22:40.242
- Yes.
- You saw this with your own eyes?

22:40.276 --> 22:41.443
Was anyone with you?

22:41.478 --> 22:43.312
Don't look around the
room and don't hesitate.

22:43.346 --> 22:45.280
You look like you're hiding something.

22:45.315 --> 22:47.383
Why are you looking at me like that?

22:47.417 --> 22:49.518
- Like what?
- You have a look on your face.

22:49.552 --> 22:51.253
You can't have a look on your face.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.122
You have to be relaxed and friendly,

22:53.156 --> 22:55.257
but professional, and don't
let your voice get high-pitched.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.392
Can we take a break?

22:56.426 --> 22:58.060
You can't take a break
during your interview.

22:58.094 --> 22:59.261
I know, okay!

22:59.295 --> 23:00.462
And you definitely can't use that tone

23:00.497 --> 23:03.132
with your interviewer.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.167
I just I wish I didn't have to do this.

23:05.201 --> 23:07.369
I know it's the only way
to prove that I'm right

23:07.404 --> 23:09.338
- and avoid getting fired...
- If you blow this interview,

23:09.372 --> 23:11.106
you're gonna get fired anyway.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.144
Let's not be naive here, April.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.380
You're about to go up on a podium

23:18.415 --> 23:20.215
to defend yourself publicly.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.383
You have to nail this

23:21.418 --> 23:23.318
or the newspaper is gonna look even worse

23:23.353 --> 23:27.055
for keeping you on
after canning the editor.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.991
That was supposed to motivate you.

23:36.132 --> 23:37.366
Hey.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.135
So the talk's at 6:00 tomorrow.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.938
Oh, great, yeah, I'm excited.

23:42.972 --> 23:46.208
I mean, to see Malalala.

23:46.242 --> 23:48.076
Hmm.

23:48.111 --> 23:51.914
It's a rare opportunity to...

23:51.948 --> 23:53.015
There should be lot's to talk about.

23:53.049 --> 23:55.050
Maybe we could go grab
a little dinner after.

23:56.286 --> 23:58.220
If that's okay.

24:01.124 --> 24:03.859
I'm sorry, look, I...

24:03.893 --> 24:06.028
I just got out of something
and it's kind of like

24:06.062 --> 24:08.831
I don't feel ready to
commit to anyone right now.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.966
Part of it... is just that...

24:11.000 --> 24:12.901
Can I ask you, how old are you?

24:12.936 --> 24:14.870
Do you mind... forget
it. It doesn't matter.

24:14.904 --> 24:16.071
That's not the point. The point is...

24:16.105 --> 24:18.207
I feel like right now is not...

24:18.241 --> 24:21.009
- This is just a time that...
- Sara.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.144
It's fine.

24:22.178 --> 24:24.012
We can just go as friends.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.081
- Okay?
- Okay.

24:39.095 --> 24:40.095
Ahh, oh!

24:41.698 --> 24:43.899
Hi.

24:43.933 --> 24:47.069
I'm sorry, sir, did you
walk into the wrong house?

24:47.103 --> 24:49.872
- Are you...
- What? No, I'm Sam.

24:49.906 --> 24:52.007
Oh, good, you're home.

24:52.041 --> 24:53.976
I was hoping I could introduce you

24:54.010 --> 24:55.644
before we had to leave.

24:55.678 --> 24:56.745
Sara, this is Sam.

24:56.779 --> 24:58.981
- Nice to officially meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:59.015 --> 25:01.884
Well, now that you know he's
real, we'll be on our way.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.919
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

25:03.953 --> 25:05.654
Where are you two going?

25:05.688 --> 25:07.856
We're going to the Miley Cyrus concert.

25:07.891 --> 25:09.525
Really?

25:09.559 --> 25:11.860
No, but I figured you'd believe anything.

25:14.998 --> 25:16.632
Yeah.

25:18.968 --> 25:21.603
Hey, you're never gonna guess
what I put on these crackers.

25:21.638 --> 25:23.839
I'm gonna give you a hint,
it's from Southern Finland.

25:23.873 --> 25:25.874
Graham, I love you for
making all of this food,

25:25.909 --> 25:27.776
but I'm in the middle of
something really important.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.645
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
- What?

25:29.679 --> 25:31.813
Did you just say that you love me?

25:31.848 --> 25:33.815
For, like, the first time?

25:33.850 --> 25:36.485
I just meant that...

25:36.519 --> 25:38.787
- So what's on the cracker?
- What? Screw the crackers.

25:38.821 --> 25:39.788
I want to talk about my feelings for me.

25:39.822 --> 25:41.690
Olives? Is it olives?

25:42.926 --> 25:44.626
It's rubber, actually.

25:44.661 --> 25:45.861
There's an edible part to the rubber plant.

25:45.895 --> 25:47.563
You just got to pickle it and roast it.

25:47.597 --> 25:49.598
The thing is, in Helsinki,
it's considered street food,

25:49.632 --> 25:51.333
but you're not supposed
to eat the sap because...

25:51.367 --> 25:52.534
Yeah, tell me at the after party.

25:52.569 --> 25:54.336
- What after party?
- At your place.

25:54.370 --> 25:56.338
A total of two have RSVP'd.

25:59.342 --> 26:00.642
Oh, me and...

26:02.445 --> 26:05.280
Just got told I was loved.

26:05.315 --> 26:06.548
Oh, I am so glad that you're here.

26:06.583 --> 26:07.683
Oh, you look amazing.

26:07.717 --> 26:10.452
Oh, thanks, my goal is actually

26:10.486 --> 26:11.766
for one of Jaclyn's fancy buyers

26:11.788 --> 26:13.355
to compliment my outfit

26:13.389 --> 26:14.456
and then offer me my own deal

26:14.490 --> 26:15.624
to design an affordable

26:15.658 --> 26:17.392
but a fashionable line of my own.

26:17.427 --> 26:19.561
That's realistic, right?

26:19.596 --> 26:21.463
- Totally.
- Oh, good.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.298
- So put me to work.
- Oh, could you check in

26:23.333 --> 26:25.233
with Brenna and Greer and just
make sure they're all right?

26:25.268 --> 26:26.435
I just know they've never done this before

26:26.469 --> 26:27.502
and I'm kind of running around and...

26:27.537 --> 26:29.338
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

26:35.478 --> 26:37.446
Excuse me, have you seen...

26:37.480 --> 26:40.248
Whoa, my God!

26:40.283 --> 26:42.451
I know, it's so me, right?

26:42.485 --> 26:45.253
The theme is "Return to Innocence".

26:45.288 --> 26:47.489
Are teenagers really returning
to innocence these days?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.291
Uh, no, that's like never gonna happen.

26:49.325 --> 26:51.493
How was your interview prep?

26:51.527 --> 26:54.162
I'm probably gonna get fired.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.564
You haven't even done the interview yet.

26:55.598 --> 26:57.165
I'm not even sure if I should.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.400
If I end up looking like an idiot,

26:58.434 --> 27:00.314
they're gonna fire me
anyway. So it's lose-lose.

27:00.336 --> 27:02.537
Why are you assuming
you're gonna screw it up?

27:02.572 --> 27:05.140
Because it's majorly stressing me out.

27:05.174 --> 27:07.442
And I'm like in remission from cancer.

27:07.477 --> 27:09.111
The last thing I should be doing

27:09.145 --> 27:10.312
is stressing myself out.

27:10.346 --> 27:13.015
Maybe I should just try and get out of it.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.084
So that if they fire
me, it's on my own terms.

27:16.119 --> 27:18.053
Hey, where is your lip gloss?

27:18.087 --> 27:19.488
Oh, here, it's in a secret pocket.

27:19.522 --> 27:22.290
Is that Rebecca Minkoff? Love.

27:22.325 --> 27:24.126
- Oh.
- Uh, yeah.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.294
I had to ask them to take
it out of the window display

27:26.329 --> 27:28.163
- at Saks.
- Okay, come on, girls.

27:28.197 --> 27:30.232
You're up.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.303
You look great.

27:38.174 --> 27:40.942
Jeez, sorry. I'll leave you alone.

27:40.977 --> 27:43.211
- Greer. Wait.
- Never mind.

27:55.865 --> 27:57.832
Just 'cause it's rubber
doesn't mean you can't eat it.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.334
All right, just try one.

27:59.335 --> 28:00.669
Try one, and then...

28:06.408 --> 28:08.309
Bren, what's going on?

28:08.310 --> 28:10.311
- What do you mean?
- I don't get

28:10.312 --> 28:11.480
why you're lying to me about Greer.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.616
She bought you that purse, right?

28:15.684 --> 28:17.318
This is why I didn't tell you.

28:17.319 --> 28:18.854
I knew you would make a big deal about it.

28:18.854 --> 28:20.523
It obviously is a big deal

28:20.524 --> 28:22.724
if you're going out of
your way to hide it from me.

28:22.725 --> 28:25.427
Are you guys, like, dating again?

28:25.427 --> 28:28.062
No, I told you. We're just friends.

28:28.063 --> 28:30.698
Then why was she all over you before?

28:30.699 --> 28:33.067
I don't care if you guys are together.

28:33.068 --> 28:34.903
I just want you to tell me the truth.

28:34.904 --> 28:36.405
Hey, have you guys seen Greer?

28:36.505 --> 28:38.640
She's wearing Jaclyn's favorite piece

28:38.641 --> 28:40.542
and we can't find her.

28:48.584 --> 28:50.518
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

28:50.519 --> 28:52.054
I just hate this dress.

28:52.054 --> 28:54.322
I know, but we're almost done.

28:54.323 --> 28:56.291
I just don't even want
to go back out there.

28:56.292 --> 28:58.593
No, please tell me you're not serious.

28:58.594 --> 29:01.829
Okay, you seem mad at me
for what happened earlier.

29:01.830 --> 29:03.431
I'm not.

29:03.432 --> 29:05.400
It's just this stupid collar

29:05.401 --> 29:06.801
is way too high!

29:06.802 --> 29:08.469
And it just needs to be lower.

29:08.470 --> 29:09.671
I wouldn't pull on it like that.

29:09.672 --> 29:11.306
I just need to loosen it a little!

29:11.307 --> 29:13.508
Greer, stop.

29:13.509 --> 29:16.411
No.

29:16.412 --> 29:18.313
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

29:18.314 --> 29:20.348
I can't handle this tonight.

29:22.017 --> 29:23.484
- Oh my God!
- It's okay, it's okay.

29:23.485 --> 29:24.852
We'll fix it. We'll fix it.

29:24.853 --> 29:27.322
Jaclyn, just give me five minutes

29:27.323 --> 29:29.057
and this'll all be taken care of.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.459
I'll meet you out there, okay?

29:31.460 --> 29:32.627
Just five minutes.

29:42.404 --> 29:44.405
Hello, good night.

29:44.406 --> 29:45.473
Hang on, mom.

29:45.474 --> 29:47.809
Can I ask you something?

29:47.810 --> 29:51.613
No, I never joined a book club.

29:53.415 --> 29:56.751
Why didn't you just tell me about Sam?

29:56.752 --> 29:59.387
I didn't want to upset you.

29:59.388 --> 30:00.855
Why would it upset me

30:00.856 --> 30:02.757
seeing you date someone?

30:02.758 --> 30:05.593
I knew that saying good-bye
to George was hard for you.

30:05.594 --> 30:08.363
And I didn't want to be insensitive

30:08.364 --> 30:11.032
flaunting my relationship.

30:11.033 --> 30:13.334
It can't be easy seeing your mother

30:13.335 --> 30:14.736
get more action than you.

30:14.737 --> 30:17.839
And thank you, by the way,

30:17.840 --> 30:21.840
for assuming it was more likely
I'd have Alzheimers than sex.

30:22.311 --> 30:25.913
But I remember when dad died,

30:25.914 --> 30:29.450
you saying you were done with men

30:29.451 --> 30:31.386
because he was the love of your life.

30:31.387 --> 30:33.054
And he was,

30:33.055 --> 30:35.556
but going to my reunion

30:35.557 --> 30:37.992
put things in perspective.

30:37.993 --> 30:41.429
I was so excited to catch
up with all my old friends,

30:41.430 --> 30:43.364
until I realized that most of the people

30:43.365 --> 30:45.466
I was hoping to see weren't coming.

30:45.467 --> 30:47.769
They were dead.

30:47.770 --> 30:50.338
Mom.

30:50.339 --> 30:52.440
But that made me think.

30:54.009 --> 30:55.677
I'm not dead.

30:55.678 --> 30:59.678
So why am I acting like
it's too late to live?

31:00.382 --> 31:02.383
That whole weekend I had kind of

31:02.384 --> 31:04.419
a little crush on Sam,

31:04.420 --> 31:06.287
but I didn't do anything about it.

31:06.288 --> 31:08.022
I kept wanting to say something,

31:08.023 --> 31:11.426
but it was like I was
right back in high school.

31:13.495 --> 31:16.464
And then an hour before my train

31:16.465 --> 31:18.599
I thought...

31:18.600 --> 31:20.368
I'm in my 70s.

31:20.369 --> 31:23.738
If I don't go for it now,

31:23.739 --> 31:25.773
it'll never happen and I'll miss out

31:25.774 --> 31:27.675
on this experience.

31:27.676 --> 31:30.678
So I told him.

31:30.679 --> 31:33.047
That's so sweet.

31:33.048 --> 31:34.716
I kind of wish

31:34.717 --> 31:37.351
I'd lived my whole life like that.

31:37.352 --> 31:38.287
Just...

31:38.288 --> 31:40.321
Acting on my impulses

31:40.322 --> 31:42.056
and seeing where it took me.

31:42.057 --> 31:44.726
Who knows how much more fun

31:44.727 --> 31:46.694
I could have had?

31:49.417 --> 31:51.685
I mean, with all the attention
on the cattle industry,

31:51.686 --> 31:53.954
I think muumuu's are really
gonna be in this season.

31:53.955 --> 31:56.423
Just have your people tweet my people...

31:56.424 --> 31:59.193
How's Greer?

31:59.194 --> 32:01.295
She's fine.

32:01.296 --> 32:04.498
She's just going through
some stuff, lately.

32:04.499 --> 32:07.301
What kind of stuff?

32:07.302 --> 32:10.437
She really seemed... off.

32:10.438 --> 32:13.207
Well, she stopped taking her medication.

32:13.208 --> 32:15.442
So it's probably just that.

32:15.443 --> 32:18.278
Like prescription medication?

32:18.279 --> 32:20.581
Yeah, you know, like for mood stuff.

32:20.582 --> 32:24.284
So what? She like just went off it?

32:24.285 --> 32:26.620
Did she talk to her doctor?

32:26.621 --> 32:28.222
Do her parents know?

32:28.223 --> 32:31.325
You mean the parents that
were going to have me arrested.

32:31.326 --> 32:32.893
You don't get it.

32:32.894 --> 32:34.928
Her family's not like our family.

32:34.929 --> 32:36.363
They're just gonna be super pissed,

32:36.364 --> 32:38.565
and, like, punish her.

32:38.566 --> 32:40.801
But you can't handle this on your own.

32:40.802 --> 32:42.503
You shouldn't let her drag you into

32:42.504 --> 32:43.737
something so complicated.

32:43.738 --> 32:45.739
She's not dragging me into it.

32:45.740 --> 32:46.874
I want to be there for her.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.542
There's nobody else.

32:48.543 --> 32:50.844
- You're a kid.
- So what?!

32:50.845 --> 32:52.646
I'm not just gonna give up on someone

32:52.647 --> 32:54.882
the minute that they
start to have problems.

32:54.883 --> 32:56.517
I'm sorry if you can't understand that.

33:04.745 --> 33:07.847
I can't even see where Greer ripped this.

33:07.848 --> 33:10.716
Since when did you
become so great at sewing?

33:10.717 --> 33:12.852
Hmm, practice makes perfect...

33:12.853 --> 33:15.387
Well, practice and adrenaline.

33:15.388 --> 33:17.323
Oh, Jaclyn, hi.

33:17.324 --> 33:18.858
I am so sorry

33:18.859 --> 33:20.459
about what happened with
that model I recommended.

33:20.460 --> 33:23.395
I take full responsibility
and I really hope...

33:23.396 --> 33:25.297
- do you know how to tweet?
- Yeah.

33:25.298 --> 33:27.233
Good. Can you tweet my followers

33:27.234 --> 33:29.268
that they can look for my designs soon

33:29.269 --> 33:32.505
because all of the buyers wanted them.

33:32.506 --> 33:35.307
Really? I mean, that's fantastic!

33:35.308 --> 33:36.976
Oh, you're promoted to first assistant.

33:36.977 --> 33:39.245
So I did a good job?

33:39.246 --> 33:41.914
You did fine. I just
hate meeting new people.

33:41.915 --> 33:45.317
Oh, you're also gonna need both of these.

33:45.318 --> 33:48.320
And as my first assistant,
you are never to ride the "T"

33:48.321 --> 33:50.289
because I need to be able
to get in touch with you

33:50.290 --> 33:52.391
24-7, and I can't do that
if you're underground.

33:52.392 --> 33:54.994
Okay, I'll see you at 7:00 in the morning.

33:57.864 --> 33:59.965
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

34:02.235 --> 34:03.903
Two Blackberries?

34:03.904 --> 34:07.439
Maybe one's for playing Bejeweled.

34:20.987 --> 34:23.589
♪ Was it all a dream? ♪

34:23.590 --> 34:26.692
♪ How I remember you... ♪

34:26.693 --> 34:29.495
I bet you regret
recommending me for this, huh?

34:31.331 --> 34:33.299
It's fine.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.400
I am worried about you, though.

34:36.953 --> 34:41.456
You've been acting
kinda all over the place.

34:41.456 --> 34:44.159
Sorry, I'm just confused.

34:44.201 --> 34:46.502
About your medication?

34:46.503 --> 34:48.536
Maybe.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.507
I don't know.

34:52.509 --> 34:54.743
I only stopped taking them

34:54.744 --> 34:57.012
as a way to get back at my parents.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.915
They just have so much power over me,

34:59.916 --> 35:02.017
like they control my life.

35:04.588 --> 35:07.790
But being off of them isn't working either.

35:07.791 --> 35:10.693
I thought I'd feel better,

35:10.694 --> 35:14.230
but I just feel out of control.

35:17.167 --> 35:19.201
And, you know, it's hard

35:19.202 --> 35:23.239
being around you and not being with you.

35:26.576 --> 35:28.511
Greer...

35:32.883 --> 35:36.619
You don't want to get
back together, do you?

35:36.620 --> 35:39.088
It's not that. I just...

35:42.259 --> 35:45.494
You're obviously...

35:45.495 --> 35:47.796
Figuring some stuff out right now.

35:50.667 --> 35:54.637
And I feel like I should just
be there for you as a friend.

35:57.474 --> 36:01.474
♪ I don't love, love, love ♪

36:02.512 --> 36:05.548
♪ love, and I don't love... ♪

36:09.186 --> 36:10.653
Want me to plug that in?

36:10.654 --> 36:12.621
No, that's okay.

36:12.622 --> 36:14.657
I don't want to, like, electrocute you.

36:14.658 --> 36:16.559
You sure about that?

36:20.597 --> 36:22.565
I didn't mean to sound condescending

36:22.566 --> 36:23.866
about the Greer stuff.

36:23.867 --> 36:26.602
How is she?

36:26.603 --> 36:28.237
She's okay.

36:28.238 --> 36:30.139
I'm just trying to be there for her

36:30.140 --> 36:32.608
right now as a friend.

36:32.609 --> 36:34.877
She needs me.

36:34.878 --> 36:36.645
That's really cool of you.

36:36.646 --> 36:38.480
I know how hard it is

36:38.481 --> 36:40.216
to be there for someone who's depressed.

36:40.217 --> 36:42.484
Leo can't shake it, ever since surgery.

36:42.485 --> 36:45.821
And it's just making me wonder
if I should even try anymore.

36:45.822 --> 36:47.623
That's how I felt yesterday.

36:47.624 --> 36:50.559
Man, how did we end up
picking such head cases?

36:50.560 --> 36:52.228
No idea.

36:52.229 --> 36:53.896
But I'll have plenty of time to ponder it

36:53.897 --> 36:55.598
while I'm unemployed.

36:57.167 --> 37:00.169
Why are you so afraid of this interview?

37:01.571 --> 37:03.472
Bren, you have no idea

37:03.473 --> 37:05.641
- How hard these questions...
- No, no, I get

37:05.642 --> 37:08.143
that it would be scary for most people,

37:08.144 --> 37:10.846
but you've lived through cancer.

37:10.847 --> 37:14.783
The worst-case scenario
with cancer is dying.

37:14.784 --> 37:18.120
What's the worst-case
scenario with this interview?

37:18.121 --> 37:21.257
It can't be that bad.
It's not gonna kill you.

37:27.631 --> 37:30.065
Knock, knock.

37:30.066 --> 37:32.001
Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you
in the middle of something?

37:32.002 --> 37:34.169
No, I'm just... I'm trying to decide

37:34.170 --> 37:35.771
whether I should take this off my shelf.

37:35.772 --> 37:37.906
Three different patients have told me

37:37.907 --> 37:39.842
this has been giving them nightmares.

37:39.843 --> 37:41.677
Well, I say let 'em have nightmares.

37:41.678 --> 37:42.845
I mean, you're a therapist, right?

37:42.846 --> 37:44.079
It's got to be good for business.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.881
Good point.

37:45.882 --> 37:47.516
Maybe I'll try to make this shelf

37:47.517 --> 37:49.118
a little scarier while I'm at it.

37:49.119 --> 37:52.187
I'll see if I got any
loose teeth lying around.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.789
I'll double my income in no time.

37:53.790 --> 37:54.857
Well, I expect 10%.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.892
I just came by to see what time

37:56.893 --> 37:58.994
you wanted to leave for
the Malala talk tonight.

37:58.995 --> 38:01.163
I don't have any more clients today, so...

38:01.164 --> 38:03.499
Free to go whenever, as friends.

38:05.168 --> 38:08.070
Well, I had a patient,
but, um, he rescheduled.

38:08.071 --> 38:09.538
- So...
- Oh, great.

38:09.539 --> 38:13.509
Okay, well, it's 4:00 now.

38:13.510 --> 38:15.678
Maybe we should leave around 5:00 or so?

38:15.679 --> 38:17.179
Sound good? I'll just come back then?

38:17.180 --> 38:19.515
- Great.
- Okay.

38:19.516 --> 38:22.017
Or...

38:22.018 --> 38:23.552
What?

38:30.226 --> 38:32.661
Sorry, I didn't...

38:32.662 --> 38:34.096
Think I was gonna...

38:39.235 --> 38:42.037
Oh.

38:42.038 --> 38:43.639
This is...

38:43.640 --> 38:46.575
It's... rare,

38:46.576 --> 38:47.676
and I...

38:47.677 --> 38:49.645
From Tanzania and it's just...

39:29.052 --> 39:31.687
April Carver, let's get started.

39:31.688 --> 39:33.055
Why don't you tell me what you were doing

39:33.056 --> 39:34.623
at the Newbury house.

39:34.624 --> 39:35.924
I went to the Newbury house

39:35.925 --> 39:37.226
to get the scoop on whether or not

39:37.227 --> 39:39.528
Richie Miranda was being
traded to another team.

39:39.529 --> 39:40.763
Well, there are ways to pass a drug test

39:40.764 --> 39:42.064
without being clean.

39:42.065 --> 39:43.866
Is that an implication that Mr. Miranda

39:43.867 --> 39:45.667
somehow tampered with the test?

39:45.668 --> 39:48.837
All I know is that I'm telling the truth.

39:48.838 --> 39:50.572
And I don't have to tell you

39:50.573 --> 39:52.708
that my job as a journalist
is to recount the facts

39:52.709 --> 39:54.576
as fairly and accurately as I can.

39:54.577 --> 39:57.613
If you could say anything to him,

39:57.614 --> 39:58.847
what would you say?

39:58.848 --> 40:01.049
I would tell him that

40:01.050 --> 40:03.719
I'm sorry for the way things went down.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.487
He's not a bad guy.

40:05.488 --> 40:07.022
He's sick.

40:07.023 --> 40:08.590
And if I had looked the other way,

40:08.591 --> 40:11.627
I would've only been
enabling his addiction.

40:11.628 --> 40:13.629
And I would tell him that

40:13.630 --> 40:15.230
I know how hard it is

40:15.231 --> 40:17.599
to face an illness head-on.
