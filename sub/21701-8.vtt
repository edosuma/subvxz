WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.233
(Chloe) Ding-dong!

00:10.300 --> 00:11.867
We are back!

00:11.933 --> 00:16.667
This time things are gonna be
pure CRAZY!

00:20.333 --> 00:21.933
Let's get fucking mortal!

00:24.367 --> 00:26.300
Yay!

00:26.367 --> 00:28.533
You can fuck off!
Fucking divvy.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.700
Yes!

00:32.133 --> 00:35.200
We're gonna be the radgiest
we have ever been!

00:36.767 --> 00:39.200
(cheering)
What the hell?!

00:42.667 --> 00:45.133
Ah, fucking yes!

00:45.200 --> 00:46.833
(shouts) Aaron!

00:47.867 --> 00:50.467
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad tings.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.333
Oh, my God!

00:56.867 --> 00:59.700
This is amazing!
(cheering)

00:59.767 --> 01:02.867
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.833
Cheers!
(laughter)

01:07.433 --> 01:10.933
I'm just not ready to... Commit.
Commit to them feelings.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.367
I wish I could tell Marnie

01:12.433 --> 01:16.167
I wanna be girlfriend and
boyfriend,
but I don't want to push her
away.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.767
(cheering)
It's Joel.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.200
I just hope he doesn't
get too drunk tonight

01:20.267 --> 01:23.633
and I can finally get
a bit of action.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.833
Gaz is gonna shag someone else.
That's fine, he can.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.267
I've never had a friend
with benefits, but Abbie is
sound.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.467
Tomorrow we're having
a massive house party.

01:34.533 --> 01:37.367
Marnie, you got any
fit mates coming to this party?

01:38.933 --> 01:41.300
Don't say you'll fuck
one of my mates.

01:41.367 --> 01:44.233
I don't know why she's
fucking annoyed.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.900
I thought he'd changed.
Has he fuck!

01:48.967 --> 01:51.733
I'm gutted.
I've ruined everyone's night.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.067
And worse, I'm going to A and E.
What a dickhead!

01:57.267 --> 01:59.800
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:59.867 --> 02:02.500
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.800
Get me in.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:04.867 --> 02:07.933
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.067
I'm preened to perfection.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.467
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.333
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.300
I can talk the back legs
Off a donkey.

02:18.367 --> 02:21.300
My quiff's pure lethal
and my banter's pure naughty.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.800
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:38.867 --> 02:41.000
Morning.
Hello.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.133
Things got eventful last night.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.633
Last night Aaron got pissed
and he wanted to shag

02:46.700 --> 02:50.200
one of my mates at
his birthday party. What the
hell?

02:50.267 --> 02:51.967
I was really humiliated.

02:52.033 --> 02:56.233
I'm dreading this house party.
I hope everything is resolved.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.067
If not, I don't think I can go.

02:58.133 --> 03:02.000
I do feel sorry for Marnie.
Aaron
should never have said what he
said.

03:02.067 --> 03:05.233
But he loves her and he would
never want to hurt her.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.867
I just hope they sort things out
before tonight.

03:07.933 --> 03:12.533
I will warn you, Gary is
massively,
massively on the pull tonight.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.500
I don't think you'll care,
though,
will you, or not?

03:15.567 --> 03:18.367
Yeah,
obviously I'm not gonna kick
off.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.033
I would never do that.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.533
It would be a bit weird, so then
I'd just go and neck on someone.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.567
My hand is fucking killing.

03:27.633 --> 03:32.800
It wouldn't be your birthday
unless
you spent it in Newcastle A and
E.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.000
Ah, man!

03:34.067 --> 03:36.200
I'm in no mood to celebrate.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.167
I ruined everyone's night
and upset Marnie.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.433
I'm fucking devastated.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.200
Why would I ever say what's
come out my mouth last night?

03:45.267 --> 03:48.933
For one second you kind of
came round and went,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.100
"I forgot where I was
for a second."

03:51.167 --> 03:54.100
After the way Aaron was talking
to Marnie last night,

03:54.167 --> 03:56.100
he is gonna have to apologise.

03:56.167 --> 03:59.333
Aaron is stubborn.
This is gonna kill him.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.633
I'll let you plan
your apology speech.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.933
I'm going for a nice coffee.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.033
Make me one.
I will.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.600
I wake up this morning pissed
off.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.166
Me and Joel still haven't had
sex.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.733
Joel, what you're trying
to say is that

04:25.800 --> 04:28.933
you got too drunk last night

04:29.000 --> 04:31.967
and you couldn't see
let alone get it up.

04:32.033 --> 04:34.033
Fuck sake!

04:44.433 --> 04:47.267
Marnie, I know it went
a bit west last night,

04:47.333 --> 04:49.167
you and Aaron and that, but...

04:49.233 --> 04:52.233
I just hope it's sorted by
tonight.
It will. It will.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.667
Tonight,
it's Aaron's birthday party.

04:54.733 --> 04:57.400
Before I celebrate,
he's got to make things right.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.167
Morning.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.567
Everyone's downstairs
having breakfast,

05:04.633 --> 05:06.733
and I'm more nervous
to walk down there

05:06.800 --> 05:08.600
than I was walking out
to my fight.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.667
I'm fucking shitting myself.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.333
You all right?

05:13.400 --> 05:17.300
I'm looking at Aaron and
thinking,
"Poor kid!" He looks broken.

05:17.367 --> 05:20.767
Erm... I just want to apologise
for last night.

05:20.833 --> 05:23.933
I got fucking... mortal drunk.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.133
Erm... and I hope I didn't
spoil anyone's night.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.233
A simple sorry
doesn't cut it for me.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.167
I need to know what was going on
in his head last night.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.067
Can I have a word with you,
Marns?

05:35.133 --> 05:37.767
Sorry, everyone. All right.
It's all right.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.700
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

05:41.167 --> 05:43.667
Aaron's apology seemed
really sincere.

05:43.733 --> 05:46.667
I just hope that him and Marnie
can get back on track

05:46.733 --> 05:48.500
before tonight.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.367
That's what every lad's excuse
is.
I've been down this road before.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.667
I thought me and Aaron
could have fun.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.633
But last night proved
we're on different pages.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.733
The only person I care about
spending my time with his you.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.467
I don't believe you.
Just what you did last night.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.100
I was left feeling like a mug.
I don't want to do it again.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.933
Me and Marnie have our ups and
downs
in this house,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.033
but recently we've been
getting on absolutely amazing.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.900
I hope I haven't ruined it
with one stupid mistake.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.867
No. Please?
No.

06:28.033 --> 06:31.500
It's your birthday, so I'll
forget
about last night for now.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.567
But it's going to take time
to forget.

06:37.033 --> 06:39.833
The house party has got
to be fancy dress.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.400
Geordie house parties are epic.
Us lads normally get lucky.

06:43.467 --> 06:46.633
I just hope tonight is no
exception,
cos it's been awhile.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.833
There's going to be a lot
of girls here.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.833
There's going to be a lot of
people.
A lot.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.800
Gary seems to be over-excited

06:55.867 --> 06:58.233
about the amount of girls
at the house party,

06:58.300 --> 07:00.800
and he'll definitely
be going on the pull.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.667
I'm fine, cos I will be too.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.333
Is everything all right now?
Are yous OK?

07:05.400 --> 07:08.900
I've got a lot of making up to
do.
The house party has to have a
theme.

07:08.967 --> 07:12.833
Since you acted like a baby,
that's going to be the theme.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.300
So you can walk round in a
diaper
with a dummy in your mouth,

07:16.367 --> 07:19.033
or maybe you can spit it out.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.500
Just walk round going,
"Marnie. Marnie."

07:21.567 --> 07:23.567
That'll teach us.

07:23.633 --> 07:27.333
Fuck it, I'm gonna go with it.
Things are about to get messy.

07:27.400 --> 07:32.433
Joel, Nathan, Chloe and Abbie,
yous go and get some props.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.633
Let's get fucking to it!
Let's have a fucking house
party!

07:36.700 --> 07:38.467
Bye!
Bye, you!

07:38.533 --> 07:40.033
Everyone's got their jobs,

07:40.100 --> 07:43.267
so I hope they're going
to pull out all the stops

07:43.333 --> 07:46.033
and make this house party
one of the best yet.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.833
So fuck off, you lot, make me
proud.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.567
We get to the fancy dress shop
and I'm buzzing.

07:55.633 --> 08:00.400
I can't wait to find a baby
outfit
that'll help me pull tonight.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.633
(squawks)

08:04.767 --> 08:06.667
Aw!
(squeak)

08:06.733 --> 08:08.500
I thought Gaz as had lost it.

08:08.567 --> 08:11.133
But after finding his baby
stash,

08:11.200 --> 08:14.833
it's clear this theme and the
party
are going to be epic.

08:14.900 --> 08:17.300
Mamma, bitty.

08:17.367 --> 08:20.433
Who knew sucking a dummy,
drinking out a baby bottle

08:20.500 --> 08:23.333
and wearing a fucking bib
would be so much fun?!

08:23.400 --> 08:25.733
Nathan,
I think I shit myself again!

08:25.800 --> 08:27.567
I need you to change my nappy!

08:27.633 --> 08:29.833
Joel, why don't you wear the
nappy?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.667
Cos you shit yourself.

08:31.733 --> 08:33.933
We've got the props and
costumes.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.033
Now it's time to get back
to the house and decorate.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.866
Thank you. Ta-ra.

08:49.967 --> 08:51.567
Girls?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.767
I leave Joel for five minutes

08:55.833 --> 08:59.900
and he comes back dressed
as an Elvis impersonator.

08:59.967 --> 09:02.700
This is a baby-themed party,

09:02.767 --> 09:06.133
so why the fuck has he got
an Elvis wig on?

09:07.533 --> 09:09.367
(laughs)

09:09.433 --> 09:12.067
There is so much to do
and so little time.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.067
Everybody needs to muck in.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.500
We need this house
ready for the party.

09:16.567 --> 09:19.067
Yo, what's happening?
Aaron's birthday.

09:19.133 --> 09:22.400
We're having this house party.
It's the biggest one yet.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.833
(laughter)

09:24.900 --> 09:26.633
Put it on.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.900
And there's your outfit.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.467
Cheers.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.533
It's very important
that everyone in this house

09:38.600 --> 09:41.633
knows we're having a party.
We have to let the ducks know.

09:41.700 --> 09:46.200
Squeaky and Skinny, basically,
we are having a house party
tonight.

09:46.267 --> 09:50.000
I've got rules. Stay in your
cage,
don't be drinking,

09:50.067 --> 09:52.700
and don't be shagging.
You'll scare everyone.

09:52.767 --> 09:56.833
Keep it quiet cos no one wants
to
party hearing "Quack, quack,
quack!"

09:56.900 --> 09:59.933
(quacking)
They wanna party with we.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.800
"Keep quiet. Squeaky and Skinny
are sleeping. Quack, quack."

10:04.867 --> 10:08.900
Bye! Remember, don't shit or
shag.

10:20.267 --> 10:22.367
While everyone's getting
changed,

10:22.433 --> 10:25.400
me and Nathan are organising
Aaron's surprise.

10:25.467 --> 10:29.133
A blast from the past.
He's gonna love it.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.367
We all love Aaron
like a brother,

10:43.433 --> 10:47.767
and we are doing everything to
make
sure this is the best birthday
ever.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.800
We're pulling out all the stops.

10:55.933 --> 10:58.633
Here's to being a baby!
Baby!

10:58.700 --> 11:01.833
Baby!
(they mimic crying)

11:01.900 --> 11:03.867
Waaah! Waaah!

11:03.933 --> 11:06.633
Let's get mwaaah-mortal!

11:06.700 --> 11:09.433
(laughter)
(Nathan) Oh, fucking hell!

11:11.300 --> 11:14.500
I think I came out this worse
than both of you.

11:14.567 --> 11:18.933
It's the first house party I've
been to in years where I'm
single.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.533
I can't fucking wait.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.467
Tonight Gary gets back
in the pulling game.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.600
I just hope the girls
don't get put off

11:25.667 --> 11:27.867
by the fact I'm dressed
as a giant baby.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.467
She's coming round.
Technically he's single.

11:33.533 --> 11:36.833
Never.
Mate, cat among the pigeons.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.333
Me and you, rampage.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.100
Gaz, are you fucking mad?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.933
Why would I go on the pull
when I've got Marns?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.633
She's the only girl
I'm interested in pulling.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.167
(laughter)

11:50.567 --> 11:53.967
Everyone will have a good time.
Who would have thought babies

11:54.033 --> 11:55.667
looked this good?
(knocking)

11:55.733 --> 12:00.600
There's a knock at the door.
It's the mystery guest! Shh!

12:00.667 --> 12:02.333
It's a surprise.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.633
I hope everybody
stays in the rooms

12:06.700 --> 12:08.500
so they don't ruin the surprise.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.133
Right, Aaron's surprise guest
has arrived.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.433
The place looks like
a preschool nursery.

12:19.500 --> 12:24.133
There's loads of booze.
All we need now is the birthday
boy.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.467
Everyone!
Girls!

12:25.533 --> 12:27.333
Hi.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.600
Yous look lovely!

12:28.667 --> 12:30.033
(they mimic baby cries)

12:30.100 --> 12:32.033
Before the house party starts,

12:32.100 --> 12:34.900
I want to give Aaron a present
I've had secretly made.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.167
I hope he likes it.

12:36.233 --> 12:40.133
Aaron... you're my best mate
so I've got you a present.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.333
I'll be two seconds.
Gary's got a present for Aaron.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.100
I hope he hurries the fuck up

12:45.167 --> 12:48.933
because I'm not sure
our present is still breathing.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.967
What is it?

12:52.033 --> 12:53.533
(all cheer)

12:53.600 --> 12:57.233
What the fuck, Gary? You'll be
asking Aaron to be your
boyfriend.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.233
Cheers, bro. Thank you.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.567
Gaz, that's one of the most
thoughtful presents I've ever
had

13:03.633 --> 13:05.867
and that's why
you're one of my best mates.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.167
Aw, that is such a nice present.

13:08.233 --> 13:12.033
Gary's got Aaron a present
and it's a fucking good one!

13:12.100 --> 13:15.067
I do feel bad that
I haven't done anything.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.700
We've got another surprise for
you,
Aaron.

13:17.767 --> 13:20.700
Aaron, if you just look over
at the present...

13:20.767 --> 13:22.967
That is a big box.
Please don't tell me

13:23.033 --> 13:25.600
in there is a fucking
roly-poly stripper!

13:25.667 --> 13:27.267
Where's Cindy?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.200
(cheering)

13:32.067 --> 13:36.933
Out pops James. I am so happy
that kid's shown up for my
birthday.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.133
Right, let's get fucking pissed.
(cheering)

13:42.233 --> 13:43.633
Let's fucking have it!

13:43.700 --> 13:45.700
Marnie looks fucking
unbelievable!

13:45.767 --> 13:47.667
Aaron's got a boner!

13:47.733 --> 13:49.333
Ahh...
How do you know Chloe?

13:49.400 --> 13:51.833
Chloe, where you been hiding
her?

13:51.900 --> 13:56.400
Gary is single and he can do
what he wants. And so can I.

13:57.833 --> 13:59.833
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

14:03.000 --> 14:03.200
.

14:05.700 --> 14:05.900
.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.900
I am buzzing to get fucking
mortal!

14:18.967 --> 14:21.333
Cue on the party!

14:24.300 --> 14:26.233
(shrieks)

14:28.367 --> 14:30.767
Aaron's birthday,
we're having a party.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.633
I'm buzzing my best mate Ry
has made it.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.233
Let's fucking have it!

14:41.333 --> 14:43.233
Cheers!

14:45.367 --> 14:48.367
Gary? Come here.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.600
These are my friends.
You all right?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.100
You all right?

14:56.767 --> 14:58.767
Chloe's introducing me to her
mates.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.367
I've got to say Bethan
is looking pretty hot.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.067
Where you been hiding her?

15:03.133 --> 15:04.467
How do you know Chloe?

15:21.333 --> 15:23.167
I'm so happy that James is here.

15:23.233 --> 15:26.067
He's a good listener
when it comes to my problems.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.500
James is right. Me and Marnie
do have ups and downs,

15:40.567 --> 15:42.333
but we always get back together.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.800
I hope this time
we can have a relationship

15:44.867 --> 15:46.433
and give things a proper go.

15:59.933 --> 16:03.167
This is the best fucking party,
like!

16:08.167 --> 16:11.000
Gary? Do a speech!

16:11.067 --> 16:13.800
I hate this, but I've got to do
it.
Aaron's best mate,

16:13.867 --> 16:16.433
I gonna have to make
a fucking speech.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.633
Thank you everyone for coming.
It's
Aaron's birthday. I love him to
bits.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.867
Tonight Gary is pulling it
out of the bag.

16:22.933 --> 16:26.000
He got us an amazing present
and he's in front of everyone

16:26.067 --> 16:28.600
doing a speech
saying how much I mean to him.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.233
I fucking love that kid.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.467
Raise a glass.
Happy birthday, Aaron!

16:32.533 --> 16:34.667
(all) Happy birthday, Aaron!

16:34.733 --> 16:38.833
First it was a fucking canvas,
then it James popping out the
box,

16:38.900 --> 16:42.500
and now a speech! I need
to think of something and quick.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.000
What we're gonna do is,

16:44.067 --> 16:47.833
we're gonna go upstairs and put
the kinkiest fucking outfit on

16:47.900 --> 16:51.400
and then I'm gonna give him
the best lap-dance of his life.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.400
Aaron, forget about
all your birthday presents,

16:54.467 --> 16:57.833
because Marnie's about ready
to give you

16:57.900 --> 17:01.733
the best birthday present
of your fucking life.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.367
Tonight is going great, and it
could be about to get better,

17:17.433 --> 17:21.333
cos I've just spotted a cute lad
talking to James.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.067
I'm Abbie. Nice to meet you.

17:27.067 --> 17:29.233
This guy is even cuter up close.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.833
But I seriously need
to work on my chat.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.567
I know French, uno, dos,
tres, quatre, cinq, six,

17:35.633 --> 17:37.700
sept, huit, neuf, dix.
(laughs)

17:41.800 --> 17:43.933
You can walk and dance in them.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.700
We're ready to go.
Marnie, break a leg.

17:46.767 --> 17:51.500
Right, everyone,
where is the birthday boy?

17:52.567 --> 17:57.100
So, Aaron, we have
one more surprise for you.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.767
Another fucking surprise?

17:58.833 --> 18:01.200
I'm not sure whether
to be excited or scared.

18:01.267 --> 18:03.033
Can you just take a seat,
please.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.167
So, I can hear Sophie
outside the door

18:05.233 --> 18:08.667
introducing us
like some sort of circus act.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.667
I'm so nervous.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.233
What the hell am I even doing?
(groans)

18:13.300 --> 18:16.500
Joel, spin the track!

18:16.567 --> 18:18.467
(sassy pop music plays)

18:18.533 --> 18:20.200
(cheering)

18:25.100 --> 18:28.400
I'm not gonna lie.
Marnie looks fucking
unbelievable!

18:28.467 --> 18:31.367
But I've never been so
embarrassed
in my whole life.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.433
(cheering)

18:35.300 --> 18:37.867
I'm watching Marnie
give Aaron a lap dance.

18:37.933 --> 18:41.300
I'm getting hotter and hotter.
I'm even getting a minge twinge.

18:41.367 --> 18:43.000
(men) Aaron's got a boner!

18:43.067 --> 18:45.300
Aaron's got a boner!

18:45.367 --> 18:48.500
Oh, my God! Aaron is one lucky
lad.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.667
I wasn't expecting this.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.867
Fucking hell, this is fucking
epic!

18:56.933 --> 18:58.767
(cheering)

18:58.833 --> 19:02.367
Oh, my God!

19:02.433 --> 19:04.633
(chanting) Kiss, kiss, kiss!

19:04.700 --> 19:06.533
Nothing makes me more excited

19:06.600 --> 19:09.333
than seeing Marnie and Aaron
all over each other.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.233
Go on, then, fucking kiss!

19:12.300 --> 19:13.733
(cheering)

19:15.967 --> 19:18.900
I can't believe I just did that.

19:18.967 --> 19:22.500
I just hope that Aaron
really liked it.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.933
Shag! Shag! Shag! Shag! Shag!
Shag!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.633
The only way to hide my boner

19:26.700 --> 19:28.733
is to pick Marnie up
and run outside.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.500
Fucking see you later.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.200
My fucking face was on fire.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.033
Was it good?
Aye, it was good.

19:35.433 --> 19:36.900
Gary's present was good,

19:36.967 --> 19:40.200
but my present gave Aaron a
hard-on.
Beat that one, Gary.

19:40.267 --> 19:44.867
You know I'm not a stripper. I
actually don't know what I'm
doing.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.067
Fucking hell, I've paid for
worse.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.533
Joel?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.333
After watching Marnie's
amazing lap dance,

19:57.400 --> 19:59.367
it's got me really horny.

19:59.433 --> 20:02.267
No way am I going another night
without getting it.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.933
On the knees.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.433
OK.
Get down.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.067
And lick the vagina.
OK, I'll do that.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.867
Lick.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.667
Yes! (moans)

20:14.733 --> 20:16.900
Oh, baby!

20:23.733 --> 20:27.833
I'm cracking on with Bethan and
it's
a while since I've been on the
pull,

20:27.900 --> 20:30.000
but some things you don't
forget.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.800
Abbie's single. And Gary's
single.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.033
I've seen this so many times
in the house.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.833
People think they can be friends
with benefits

20:41.900 --> 20:44.600
and it's not gonna
change anything. Wrong!

20:49.733 --> 20:53.467
Even though I'm on the pull I
don't
want to rub it in Abbie's face,

20:53.533 --> 20:56.033
so, "Bethan, you fancy
a look at the ducks?"

21:03.933 --> 21:06.733
It looks like Gary's
pulling Bethan.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.467
He is single and he can do
what he wants.

21:09.533 --> 21:10.767
And so can I.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.433
You better not be doing
what I think you're doing.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.167
You said I'm free to crack on
with whoever I want.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.133
Do not spoil it now.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.200
Do you want to get with Gary?

21:23.267 --> 21:24.700
I don't know.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.600
Maybe.
Maybe.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.767
I've been in his bed the past
two or three nights.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.667
You've been in Gary's bed?

21:32.733 --> 21:34.100
I'm talking to Bethan,

21:34.167 --> 21:37.033
but there's nothing in it,
no cock-blocking.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.100
I just want to see what the deal
is
between them. I'm just curious.

21:41.167 --> 21:44.833
So, would you have an issue
if I got with Gary?

21:44.900 --> 21:47.500
If you wanna get with Gary,
you can get with Gary.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.367
Right.
That's absolutely fine.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.733
Me and Gary have
a great thing going.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.567
We can share each other's bed
but still pull other people.

21:56.633 --> 21:59.400
So I'm giving Bethan
the green light to crack on,

21:59.467 --> 22:01.300
cos I fancy Ryan.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.867
Hi.
Oi-oi. Oi-oi.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.367
(laughter)

22:12.433 --> 22:16.067
Nathan's giving us a lap-dance,
but he is a little bit heavy.

22:16.133 --> 22:18.600
I am getting a little bit
squished.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.567
Me and Chloe have had
our ups and downs.

22:22.633 --> 22:26.200
She's always gonna be my little
sister. I'm always here for her.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.800
I'm here, you're here.

22:32.867 --> 22:35.300
I fancy you, you fancy me.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.367
Do I?
Come on then.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.633
(chuckles)
Do you fancy me?

22:39.700 --> 22:42.633
You're all right.
I'm all right.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.233
I love the attention
Ryan's giving me tonight.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.867
This is not only unexpected,

22:47.933 --> 22:51.167
but it's also fucking nice.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.733
What I love most about
these house parties

22:56.800 --> 22:58.933
is everyone goes hell for
leather.

23:01.267 --> 23:04.067
(cheering)

23:04.133 --> 23:08.700
At first I thought I was sexy,
but now I feel like a baby seal.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.833
But I can't stop.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.500
The people want more.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.000
So I'm taking my top off.
Look at my tits, man.

23:25.633 --> 23:27.733
Tonight has been epic.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.700
But Bethan is so mortal,
she needs a fucking bed.

23:30.767 --> 23:33.533
Bye, love you!
Gary's gonna be gutted about it.

23:36.933 --> 23:40.400
This party has been amazing.
It's been good to see James
again.

23:40.467 --> 23:42.633
It's been like the old times.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.867
Abbie is wasting no time
necking on with Ryan,

23:49.933 --> 23:52.100
but I don't care.
All I care about is,

23:52.167 --> 23:54.033
"Where's Bethan?"

23:55.600 --> 23:59.333
Tonight has been epic. But time
to say goodbye to my mates.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.533
Bye, love you!

24:01.600 --> 24:05.233
I'm pissed out of my head.
I need to go to bed.

24:06.333 --> 24:07.467
Bye.

24:14.100 --> 24:17.767
Bethan's gone home and I'm left
with a big fucking bunch of
babies.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.133
Great. I'm off to bed.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.267
I feel great tonight.

24:23.333 --> 24:25.567
Me and Ryan are off to the shag
pad

24:25.633 --> 24:28.167
for a little grown-up sleepover.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.200
The closest I've got
to having any action

24:35.267 --> 24:37.433
is watching people
have sex in the house.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.200
What the hell is wrong
with my life?!

24:48.867 --> 24:52.333
For fuck sake, Chloe!
Shall I get you some popcorn?

25:04.067 --> 25:06.733
I'm so glad that Joel
hasn't got that pissed,

25:06.800 --> 25:12.133
because tonight is the night
me and him make passionate love.

25:20.567 --> 25:24.400
Tonight the family have done me
proud. I've had an amazing
birthday.

25:24.467 --> 25:27.367
And to top it off,
I get to go to bed with my
Marns.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.833
(laughter)

25:34.900 --> 25:36.800
Guys!
(laughter)

25:38.000 --> 25:40.500
Give us a break, man, come on!

25:40.567 --> 25:43.467
Keep going, then.
Nah, yous have killed the
moment.

25:51.267 --> 25:55.600
Me, Aaron and Marnie...
Oh, no!

25:55.667 --> 25:58.000
You have got to be kidding us!

25:58.067 --> 26:00.933
Daytime drinking!
Waste not, want not. (slurps)

26:01.000 --> 26:02.633
Take us to Spy Bar.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.500
We are Geordies.
We don't work on bank holiday.

26:06.367 --> 26:07.867
Did Abbie shag?
Yeah.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.567
This is awkward.

26:10.633 --> 26:12.633
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

26:15.467 --> 26:15.667
.

26:18.200 --> 26:18.400
.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.600
I'll, erm...
follow you on Twitter.
(chuckles)

26:35.667 --> 26:37.333
Last night was amazing.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.333
Not only was it Aaron's
baby-themed party

26:40.400 --> 26:42.567
but I also pulled a fit guy.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.533
In house party terms,
that was fucking wicked.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.167
I had a really good time.
I did. Really, really good.

26:55.233 --> 26:58.067
Last night was one of the best
house parties we've had

26:58.133 --> 26:59.433
in a very long time.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
And I was a fucking mess.

27:01.567 --> 27:02.833
I heard the sex.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.667
I heard you go, "Ahh!"

27:04.733 --> 27:06.100
(laughs)

27:06.167 --> 27:08.900
I probably forgot that
there was people in the room.

27:08.967 --> 27:11.700
But I didn't make any noise.
You did.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.033
That was Aaron.
Right.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.267
Oh, it was me!

27:14.333 --> 27:16.867
Last night, me and Marnie
well and truly made up

27:16.933 --> 27:19.767
and I hope we can put
the other night behind us.

27:21.067 --> 27:23.133
I'm not answering.
I'll let Marnie.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.700
It's a weird one.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.433
It is. It's very fucked up.

27:28.667 --> 27:31.600
What the hell, Abbie?
So you humped and dumped him?

27:31.667 --> 27:33.833
(chuckles)

27:33.900 --> 27:36.300
You know the boy that you
pulled?
Yeah.

27:36.367 --> 27:38.867
That's Gary's best friend.

27:38.933 --> 27:41.700
I don't know what to say.
This is awkward.

27:41.767 --> 27:45.700
My worst-case scenario would be
if Gary started to ignore us.

27:45.767 --> 27:48.033
I just hope we can
still be friends.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.367
Think it will be
awkward with Gary today?

27:50.433 --> 27:53.500
I feel like it's only going to
be
awkward if he makes it.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.167
This house is a fucking
shithole!

28:00.233 --> 28:03.067
These bottles are going
to take fucking ages, man.

28:04.733 --> 28:07.200
Love you. Love you too.
I'm going to miss you.

28:07.267 --> 28:10.967
I hate saying bye to Joel,
but I'm going to see him very
soon.

28:11.033 --> 28:13.133
It's been so good having him
here,

28:13.200 --> 28:16.933
and finally he was able
to satisfy us.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.567
Right, Joel's going, everyone.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.333
It's a bit of a coincidence
that Joel is leaving now

28:24.400 --> 28:27.400
and we've just started tidying
up.
Go on, then, fuck off.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.533
(whooping)

28:30.600 --> 28:32.033
Oh! Work it!

28:32.100 --> 28:34.267
Work it! Work it! Work it!

28:39.833 --> 28:42.067
Are you having toast?
Not that bread.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.033
You know Avril Lavigne?

28:44.100 --> 28:47.300
She's been dead for ten years
and she's gotten a look-alike

28:47.367 --> 28:49.700
to pretend to be her
for the last ten years.

28:50.533 --> 28:54.267
Eh? Avril Lavigne?
Who the fuck is she?

28:54.333 --> 28:57.200
Marnie, you read
too many magazines.

28:57.267 --> 29:00.300
Actually,
I got that from the Internet.

29:00.367 --> 29:02.033
From Google. (chuckles)

29:02.100 --> 29:03.767
(phone rings)
Oh, telephone!

29:03.833 --> 29:05.133
Oh, fuck off!

29:05.200 --> 29:07.933
The phone rings and
it's obviously going to be Anna.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.200
I hope I'm not at work.

29:11.467 --> 29:13.167
Hello?
(Anna) "Hi, Gary."

29:13.233 --> 29:16.833
"It's a bank holiday and I know
it will be very busy."

29:16.900 --> 29:18.033
OK.

29:18.100 --> 29:19.700
"I want you, Aaron and Marnie

29:19.767 --> 29:22.700
to spend a couple of hours
handing out flyers."

29:22.767 --> 29:24.833
"We need more business."

29:24.900 --> 29:26.133
All right, OK.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.733
Judging by the look on Gary's
face,
it's Anna,

29:28.800 --> 29:30.733
it doesn't look like good news.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.833
Doesn't she have anything
better to do on a bank holiday?

29:33.900 --> 29:36.800
"Don't let me down."
Bye.

29:36.867 --> 29:38.100
"Bye, Gary."

29:38.167 --> 29:41.033
What is wrong?
I don't even want to know.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.667
What is it?

29:42.733 --> 29:44.633
(laughs) It's bad.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.500
It's not me, though, is it?

29:46.567 --> 29:48.400
Work is...

29:48.467 --> 29:50.200
...me...

29:50.267 --> 29:51.700
...Aaron...

29:51.767 --> 29:54.233
...and Marnie.
Oh, no!

29:54.300 --> 29:56.300
Anna, you've got
to be kidding us!

29:56.367 --> 29:59.167
This is so unfair! (groans)

29:59.233 --> 30:02.533
Toon Tours needs work.
We've got to go out there
flyering.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.500
Oh, ill!

30:04.567 --> 30:06.900
The last thing I want to do
on a bank holiday

30:06.967 --> 30:08.967
is stand in town handing out
flyers

30:09.033 --> 30:11.600
when everyone around us
is on the drink.

30:11.667 --> 30:14.200
You know what?
It fucking sucks to be yous.

30:14.267 --> 30:17.000
I'm going to bed. Losers!

30:17.067 --> 30:18.267
Losers!

30:18.333 --> 30:21.633
I'm so happy me Nathan, Sophie
and Abbie are not going to work.

30:21.700 --> 30:24.067
I feel very, very sorry
for the others.

30:24.133 --> 30:26.833
Losers! Chloe, do you want
a sausage sandwich?

30:26.900 --> 30:29.333
Kiss this, bitch!
(laughter)

30:36.533 --> 30:39.133
This is the first time
I've not done work.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.133
Everybody on bank holiday goes
out.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.700
I'm not fucking in.
We're getting pissed.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.200
I want a nice cocktail.

30:45.267 --> 30:47.933
I am glad that Gary is going to
work.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.333
I know that I haven't done
anything wrong,

30:50.400 --> 30:52.700
but I do feel really awkward
around him.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.200
Hiya!
I hate to break it to you,

30:55.267 --> 30:58.033
but we are going drinking!

30:59.533 --> 31:02.633
It's bad enough that we have
to go to fucking work.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.800
And the others
are getting back on it.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.733
Can today get any fucking worse?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.333
Bye!
Bye!

31:08.400 --> 31:10.500
Losers!
Bye!

31:10.567 --> 31:12.167
I hope it pisses down.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.000
Girls, come on,
we're wasting drinking time.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.267
Run, run!

31:23.667 --> 31:25.967
Daytime drinking!
Daytime drinking!

31:35.567 --> 31:38.933
Right, waste not, want not.
(slurps)

31:39.000 --> 31:40.833
We're hanging after last night.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.133
Nothing cures a hangover
than getting back straight on
it.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.800
Geordie style.
Awesome foursome.

31:46.867 --> 31:50.833
Not being at work,
and getting on it till we vomit!

31:50.900 --> 31:52.267
(all) Yeah!

31:52.333 --> 31:53.967
Oh, God, yeah.
Oh, God, yeah.

31:54.033 --> 31:56.533
Abbie, I need to know
what went on last night.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.433
I watched you
for a good half an hour.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.367
I'm getting nervous because
every
time I'm with someone you watch.

32:03.433 --> 32:05.833
She's a pervert.
I'm a bit of a pervert.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.467
I watched the full thing
like I was at the cinema.

32:08.533 --> 32:11.500
All I needed was some 3D
glasses and fucking popcorn.

32:11.567 --> 32:14.067
Abbie, I don't think
you like to tell.

32:14.133 --> 32:17.667
Howay, Abbie.
We want some juicy gossip.

32:17.733 --> 32:20.333
Listen, did the dick go in?
Yeah.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.700
My turn. My turn.

32:22.767 --> 32:25.133
Did you come?
I can't remember.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.667
Stop with all of the questions,
guys.

32:27.733 --> 32:29.933
Last night was just a bit of
fun.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.767
There is nothing more to tell.

32:31.833 --> 32:35.300
Were you glad that Gary didn't
pull and you did?

32:35.367 --> 32:36.900
Yeah.
Ooh.

32:36.967 --> 32:39.467
Gary and Abbie are friends
who like a bit of fun.

32:39.533 --> 32:43.500
But them two pulling other
people
is going to end in disaster.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.533
Why is it called hair of the
dog?

32:45.600 --> 32:48.767
Cos if you're rough, dog's hair
would be rough to eat.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.367
Ah, yeah.

32:50.433 --> 32:54.200
It feels so good that we are
just
sitting back, having a drink,

32:54.267 --> 32:58.233
chilling on bank holiday while
the rest of them are out doing
work.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.667
What a sickener!

32:59.733 --> 33:01.600
I think she's drunk already.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.967
I'm fuming. I don't like
working.
I can't do it.

33:07.033 --> 33:08.833
But flyering's ill, man.

33:08.900 --> 33:11.800
We're on the way to work
and suddenly it's dawned on us.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.533
What the fuck are we doing?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.333
Divert this car?

33:15.400 --> 33:18.967
Shall we go for a drink instead?
Go straight to Spy Bar.

33:19.033 --> 33:21.767
I'd love to do that.
I can take the fucking top off.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.267
Is Anna off her fucking rocker?
We are Geordies.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.567
We don't work on bank holiday.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.167
Mate, can you just take us
to Spy Bar?

33:30.233 --> 33:31.433
Yeah, no bother.

33:40.467 --> 33:42.300
(cheering)
Oh, yeah?

33:42.367 --> 33:43.567
Oh, God!

33:43.633 --> 33:45.167
Are you clocking off, then?

33:45.233 --> 33:48.900
The workers have turned up
to the pub. What the fuck?

33:48.967 --> 33:51.233
Yous are meant to be at work.
Let us guess.

33:51.300 --> 33:52.967
Turned, in the bin, went home.

33:53.033 --> 33:56.200
Didn't even turn up.
If Anna finds out that, whoa!

33:56.267 --> 34:00.233
Well, we're gonna get punished,
but
we'll take the punishment. Fuck
it.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.700
Fuck Anna! Why should we go to
work
on a bank holiday

34:03.767 --> 34:05.967
when she's sitting with her feet
up?

34:06.033 --> 34:08.933
Gary, what's going
to happen tonight?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.233
I'm on the pull. If you don't
pull
before you leave this house,

34:12.300 --> 34:16.400
Abbie would have beat you.
Did they shag? Yeah.

34:16.467 --> 34:19.400
Me and Gary haven't spoke all
day.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.199
This is awkward.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.233
Right, look, right...

34:23.300 --> 34:26.467
Go on, Gary.
I admit it, I got beat.

34:26.533 --> 34:29.699
You might have won the battle
but I'll win the war.

34:29.766 --> 34:33.199
Fair play to Abbie. Even though
my ego is a little bit bruised,

34:33.266 --> 34:36.699
you cannot keep a good man down.
Bring on tonight.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.733
Abbie's shagged, Gary tried.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.600
Chloe, you're going through
a very, very, very dry patch.

34:42.667 --> 34:46.433
Your fanny must be starving. I
don't
want to pull a fucking stinker!

34:46.500 --> 34:50.600
Chloe hasn't pulled yet. Her
vagina
must be covered in cobwebs.

34:50.667 --> 34:54.000
So we need to go on the prowl
and look for some willy for her.

34:54.067 --> 34:57.400
Tonight,
it's all about the pulling!

35:00.700 --> 35:01.833
Let's go!

35:03.167 --> 35:06.533
We've been drinking all day.
I'm feeling a bit tipsy.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.767
So it's time to get ready
for tonight.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.933
I just want to go on the pull.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.133
Are they slippery nipples!

35:19.300 --> 35:21.167
Thank you!

35:21.233 --> 35:23.867
Why have I only just figured out
that I like him?

35:25.533 --> 35:26.700
What?

35:26.767 --> 35:29.800
Fuck! Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

35:29.867 --> 35:31.133
I said I love you.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:35.933 --> 35:36.167
.

35:38.667 --> 35:38.867
.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.467
Whoa!

35:50.533 --> 35:52.767
I'm going to get ready.

35:52.833 --> 35:56.033
Prepare yourself for all the
birds
you're going to pull.

35:56.100 --> 36:00.167
It's time to get glammed up
and get ready for round two.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.533
I need to find an outfit.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.433
I'm gonna put in extra effort
in.
I want to look really pretty.

36:12.567 --> 36:14.833
Let me see.
That actually looks nice.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.967
Got it on back to front, babe.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.433
She looks like my nan's sofa!
Next!

36:19.500 --> 36:22.433
You cannot go wrong
with a little black dress.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.667
Oh, my God, yes!

36:24.733 --> 36:27.567
Chloe, you look bloody stunning.

36:27.633 --> 36:29.467
Fucking love it!

36:29.533 --> 36:32.067
Chloe, how are you gonna
dance like that?

36:32.133 --> 36:34.500
Yeah. That's...
Yeah.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.067
I've got a really good feeling
about tonight.

36:37.133 --> 36:41.333
Hopefully I find my Prince
Charming
and I'll be happy ever after.

36:43.833 --> 36:47.633
Can you imagine if I woke up
in the morning in bed by myself?

36:47.700 --> 36:49.367
(laughs)

36:49.433 --> 36:51.900
In the house,
I've got a reputation

36:51.967 --> 36:53.533
for being the lad about town.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.733
But I haven't pulled anyone
but Abbie.

36:55.800 --> 37:00.233
I'm starting to doubt myself.
I need to prove I've still got
it.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.867
You ready, then?
Born ready. Howay.

37:02.933 --> 37:04.300
Girls!

37:04.367 --> 37:06.267
Oh, there she is!

37:07.333 --> 37:09.667
(whistles)

37:09.733 --> 37:12.533
Gary and Aaron are whistling at
us.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.500
I feel sexy, sassy and I feel
like
I'm ready for the lads.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.867
Howay, let's go.

37:21.233 --> 37:25.033
Let's get to the club,
neck a few shots and get mortal.

37:34.467 --> 37:37.167
We get in the club
and the tunes are banging.

37:37.233 --> 37:38.867
I just want to go on the pull.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.733
What the fuck, Sophie?
Are they slippery nipples?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.400
(cheering)

37:58.367 --> 38:01.400
Me and Abbie have been
getting close and she's sound,

38:01.467 --> 38:04.600
but we're both single and
nothing
is stopping me pulling.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.733
I love how close
I've got with Gary.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.600
He's helped us get over Scott
and
he's helped us come out of my
shell.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.967
And after everything,
we're still really good friends.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.633
Tonight I'm having a wicked
night.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.500
I've got Marns and we're back
to the way we were,

38:51.567 --> 38:55.233
having fun and getting mortal.
I'm fucking buzzing.

39:03.233 --> 39:06.600
I'm in the club and
I bump into my best friend
Bethan.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.533
Gary will be buzzing to see her!

39:10.933 --> 39:13.233
All I can hear is Chloe
screaming my name,

39:13.300 --> 39:15.433
and I see her with Bethan.
(chuckles)

39:15.500 --> 39:16.633
Thank you.

39:18.233 --> 39:19.833
Chloe, cheers.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.233
I can't believe Bethan
has turned up to the club.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.100
I know I can't say anything
after last night,

39:26.167 --> 39:28.633
but deep down I am gutted.

39:31.467 --> 39:36.167
I'm worried for Abbie. She does
look
upset that Gary's pulled.

39:36.233 --> 39:39.400
But she did shag his best
friend.
She needs to remember that.

39:56.200 --> 40:00.067
Gary is necking on with Bethan,
and I know I shouldn't care,

40:00.133 --> 40:01.467
but I do.

40:01.533 --> 40:04.433
Why have I only just figured out
that I like him?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.967
It's only natural
that Abbie feels like this

40:13.033 --> 40:16.333
after spending so much time
with Gary. That makes me believe

40:16.400 --> 40:18.733
she likes Gary more
than she's leading on.

40:31.667 --> 40:33.967
Tonight has been
an absolute disaster.

40:34.033 --> 40:36.133
There's no lads that I fancy
here,

40:36.200 --> 40:39.233
but hey-ho, let's get back
and get some chicken nuggets.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.900
Bethan is coming back to the
house,

40:43.967 --> 40:46.967
and I know I shouldn't have
any right to be bothered,

40:47.033 --> 40:50.800
but I am, this is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

40:59.867 --> 41:01.667
You all right?

41:02.600 --> 41:05.633
We get back to the house
and we're all absolutely mortal.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.700
And the only thing that's
on our minds is scran.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.300
I just want to say thank you.
Go have fun.

41:13.367 --> 41:16.400
Abbie seems fine that
I'm sleeping with another girl.

41:16.467 --> 41:18.733
That is friendship right there.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.833
(burps)
(laughter)

41:20.900 --> 41:22.467
Tonight has been amazing,

41:22.533 --> 41:24.733
but I'm mortal and I'm stuffed.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.333
So it's time for bed.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
(Bethan giggles)

41:34.700 --> 41:38.633
Finally, I am fucking back!

41:38.700 --> 41:40.700
(moaning)

41:45.833 --> 41:47.433
Have a nice sleep.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.800
Aaron's absolutely mortal,

41:51.867 --> 41:54.933
so I'm going to let Aaron
get a good night's sleep.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.433
Goodnight, gorgeous.
Goodnight, babe.

41:58.500 --> 42:02.400
I'm in bed mortal and I just
can't
help say them three little
words.

42:02.467 --> 42:04.500
I love you.
What?

42:04.567 --> 42:07.900
Fuck! Did I just hear
what I think I just heard?

42:07.967 --> 42:09.700
I said I love you.

42:12.367 --> 42:14.533
In what way?
I just said it.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.933
As a friend?

42:16.033 --> 42:20.233
Marnie, take what I've just said
in any way you want. Goodnight.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.533
Aaron, I know you're mortal
but do you actually mean that?

42:25.600 --> 42:29.100
I think it's best we have a chat
in the morning when you're
sober.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.800
Oh, yes.
That was the touch of a shagger.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.533
Hello, sex line.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.767
I don't know why we are not
normal.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.833
# Toon Tours!
# See the sites!

42:52.900 --> 42:54.933
Rihanna has got nowt on us.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.033
I think we're in
for a good one tonight.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.067
I do think we are soul mates.
Fucking hell!

43:01.133 --> 43:02.667
(farts)

43:03.467 --> 43:06.667
Shagging!
He's definitely got a stiffy.

43:06.733 --> 43:08.967
All I can hear is...

43:09.033 --> 43:11.067
Fuck off,
You fuck off! Fucking Divvy!

43:11.133 --> 43:13.700
That went well.
I'll smash his fucking head in!

43:13.767 --> 43:15.333
Best last night ever!

43:15.400 --> 43:17.733
It's going to be a pure belter!

43:17.800 --> 43:20.333
This is everything I've ever
wanted.

43:21.767 --> 43:22.900
I'm a giver.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.433
(chanting) Kebab! Kebab!

43:54.833 --> 43:55.033
.
