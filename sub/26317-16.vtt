WEBVTT

00:00.087 --> 00:01.863
Well, loyal listeners, we've been talking

00:01.887 --> 00:04.803
about it for weeks, and now it's
one day away, the so-called

00:04.827 --> 00:07.272
Love All L.A. Festival.

00:07.296 --> 00:09.224
Well, we gave 'em Pride Day.

00:09.248 --> 00:11.476
They demanded a Pride Month.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.144
They got West Hollywood,

00:13.168 --> 00:15.564
Now they want all of L.A.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.983
Why do they feel the need to-to force

00:18.007 --> 00:19.818
their differences on the rest of us?

00:20.254 --> 00:22.487
Oh, and do you know how much
the city is, uh, spending

00:22.511 --> 00:24.573
so these dandies can run around
with their shirts off?

00:24.597 --> 00:26.958
$1.1 million.

00:26.982 --> 00:28.326
That's taxpayer money.

00:28.350 --> 00:29.744
Now that makes me complicit.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.663
And now I have a problem.

00:31.687 --> 00:34.332
That's why I've been calling out
to all of you Storm Chasers.

00:34.356 --> 00:35.800
Come to L.A.

00:35.824 --> 00:38.503
We need to stand up for our values.

00:38.527 --> 00:41.172
Otherwise, before long, there will be

00:41.196 --> 00:44.676
LGBXYZ Festival in your town,

00:44.700 --> 00:48.430
paid for with money taken
from your pocket.

00:48.454 --> 00:52.089
Someone has to stop
this sickness before it spreads.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.560 --> 01:13.371
- Thanks for coming.
- I picked Chris up on the way.

01:13.395 --> 01:15.123
The rest of the team's at HQ, but
we're ready wherever you need us.

01:15.147 --> 01:16.791
- How are the victims?
- One woke up

01:16.815 --> 01:18.527
an hour ago. Condition's stable.

01:18.551 --> 01:20.045
The other one is still in a coma.

01:20.069 --> 01:21.785
After last night's
attack, SWAT's been put

01:21.809 --> 01:24.182
in charge of security of
today's Love All Festival.

01:24.206 --> 01:26.059
The parade's not
scheduled until this afternoon,

01:26.083 --> 01:28.186
but the streets are closed
and the bars are open early.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.971
Expecting at least 100,000 people.

01:29.995 --> 01:31.022
That's one hell of a party.

01:31.046 --> 01:32.648
What do you got for us, Detective?

01:32.672 --> 01:34.392
No witnesses to the actual crime, but,

01:34.416 --> 01:36.227
the cameras up on the
bar, they got a shot

01:36.251 --> 01:37.479
of the vehicle. It's already

01:37.503 --> 01:38.897
been abandoned a few miles from here,

01:38.921 --> 01:40.859
the VIN number and plates removed.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.368
And those prints we pulled, no hits yet.

01:43.921 --> 01:46.655
Back of the truck's covered
in Storm Forecast stickers.

01:46.679 --> 01:49.074
It's a live-streamed
radio show, podcast thing

01:49.098 --> 01:50.408
from this guy named Mark Storm.

01:50.432 --> 01:52.377
Calls himself a truth-telling patriot.

01:52.401 --> 01:54.079
Storm's been on our radar. He's using

01:54.103 --> 01:56.414
the cost of the festival
to rile up his listeners.

01:56.438 --> 01:57.549
He hasn't encouraged anyone

01:57.573 --> 01:58.774
to do anything violent, but...

01:58.798 --> 02:00.479
Someone ends up doing it anyway.

02:00.503 --> 02:02.554
The crowd's only gonna get
bigger on both sides.

02:02.578 --> 02:04.422
I'll be the bad guy.

02:04.446 --> 02:05.924
Captain, work with Detective Godfrey.

02:05.948 --> 02:07.175
Get RHD whatever they need.

02:07.199 --> 02:09.561
Let's get this guy before it escalates.

02:10.155 --> 02:12.597
I'm sorry, but we have
to keep this area clear.

02:12.621 --> 02:13.884
- It's a crime scene.
- It's okay, guys.

02:13.909 --> 02:15.138
Let's just move to the
other side of the street.

02:15.162 --> 02:16.289
Thank you!

02:19.461 --> 02:20.772
You look good.

02:21.166 --> 02:22.607
I'm alive.

02:22.631 --> 02:24.109
Are you in charge of something here?

02:24.133 --> 02:26.600
Oh, no. Just, uh, just volunteering.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.531
Be careful anyway.

02:29.555 --> 02:30.759
Oh, sure.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.252
See you then.

02:34.276 --> 02:35.620
Yeah.

02:35.644 --> 02:37.455
Hey. Uh...

02:37.924 --> 02:39.068
thanks.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.447
For the concern.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.209
W-Was that... John Paul.

02:55.117 --> 02:56.808
Who's John Paul?

02:57.369 --> 02:59.144
JP Hicks.

02:59.621 --> 03:01.468
Commander's son.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.451
Another blonde beauty.

03:06.475 --> 03:09.154
When are we gonna get one of
these that has my hair color?

03:09.178 --> 03:11.489
Oh, you mean gray?

03:11.513 --> 03:12.957
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Kay.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.659
I'm afraid we can't release
Victoria just yet.

03:14.683 --> 03:16.628
- Why? What's the problem?
- She has a condition

03:16.652 --> 03:18.496
called patent ductus arteriosus.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.165
A small hole in her heart.

03:20.189 --> 03:21.909
Most infants are born
with some form of it,

03:21.933 --> 03:24.335
but it usually closes on its own
in a few days.

03:24.359 --> 03:26.004
In Victoria's case, it hasn't.

03:26.028 --> 03:27.756
Okay, well, what does that mean?

03:27.780 --> 03:29.307
We can observe her for a few weeks

03:29.331 --> 03:31.009
and see if it improves. Or...

03:31.033 --> 03:33.311
- Surgery?
- It's a fairly simple procedure.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.513
If surgery sounds scary,
I've seen dozens of cases

03:35.537 --> 03:37.515
where children have healed on their own.

03:37.539 --> 03:39.851
But Victoria is still developing.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.853
The longer her heart takes
to close, the more prone

03:41.877 --> 03:43.354
she may be to long-term issues.

03:43.378 --> 03:45.042
What do we do?

03:46.543 --> 03:49.337
We do whatever it takes to
make sure our daughter's okay.

03:50.719 --> 03:52.697
I want officers at each
vulnerable point of entry

03:52.721 --> 03:54.199
and snipers covering the roofs

03:54.223 --> 03:56.451
of the most trafficked parts
of the parade route.

03:56.475 --> 03:58.453
But, sir, that'll take most of Metro.

03:58.477 --> 04:00.223
Then that's what it'll take.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.309
Right.

04:03.098 --> 04:04.311
JP looked good.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.078
He did.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.035
Let's hope it's the real deal this time.

04:10.155 --> 04:11.716
How long has he been clean?

04:11.740 --> 04:12.819
Couldn't tell you.

04:13.375 --> 04:16.019
The last time I saw him
was at Barb's service.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.189
I didn't know he moved back to L.A.

04:18.213 --> 04:20.225
Yeah. About a year ago.

04:20.249 --> 04:22.227
JP and I haven't spoken
since the funeral either.

04:22.251 --> 04:24.062
His sister lets me know he's okay.

04:24.086 --> 04:26.064
He and I live separate
lives, so, you know...

04:26.088 --> 04:27.816
it is what it is.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.884
Sir, if I crossed a line...

04:28.908 --> 04:30.401
No, no. You didn't.

04:30.587 --> 04:32.487
You were taken by surprise.

04:33.034 --> 04:34.016
So was I.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.317
I'm glad he's healthy

04:35.341 --> 04:37.653
and close by if he ever needs his father.

04:37.677 --> 04:38.929
Yeah.

04:48.563 --> 04:50.699
Just the man I came to see.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.867
You need a hand with that?

04:51.891 --> 04:54.203
Parole Officer Jankins, hi.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.537
Nah, I'm good.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.206
We're handing out water at Love All.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.741
That's one way to keep people alive.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.297
Mom?

05:05.321 --> 05:07.010
Okay, what's she done now?

05:07.034 --> 05:08.634
It's more like what she hasn't done:

05:08.658 --> 05:10.130
her last two required check-ins with me.

05:10.155 --> 05:11.983
Well, I'm sorry,
I haven't spoken to her in months.

05:12.008 --> 05:13.298
Check-ins are black and white.

05:13.322 --> 05:14.890
If she misses her next one,

05:14.914 --> 05:16.305
I'm gonna have to issue a warrant.

05:16.329 --> 05:18.394
And when they find her,
she's going back to prison.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.396
Like it or not, Jim,
you signed up for this.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.752
You tell her to find me.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.781
How is heart surgery elective?

05:26.806 --> 05:28.150
My daughter has a hole in her heart,

05:28.175 --> 05:29.619
and she needs it closed now.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.907
And the hospital won't schedule
an uninsured surgery

05:31.931 --> 05:33.375
without proof of payment first.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.485
And I don't have $11,000 lying around.

05:37.529 --> 05:40.582
All right, fine. You know what,
I'll just talk to somebody else.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.420
Insurance won't cover it.
They say that we need

05:44.444 --> 05:47.056
to wait two weeks to see if
Victoria's condition improves

05:47.080 --> 05:48.557
and if we want the surgery today,

05:48.581 --> 05:49.925
- we got to pay for it ourselves.
- The doctor said

05:49.949 --> 05:52.561
lots of babies wait and
everything turns out okay.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.847
I want her better as bad as you do,

05:54.871 --> 05:56.565
but we don't have any other options.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.767
The city unfreezes overtime next week.

05:59.176 --> 06:00.936
So if I can get the surgery money today,

06:00.960 --> 06:03.522
if we just hold off
until the O.T. kicks in,

06:03.546 --> 06:05.074
then-then I'll be able
to pay everything back.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.692
Bank loans? Second mortgages?

06:06.716 --> 06:08.110
The money we owe Luca?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.967
I don't want you to worry about this.

06:11.571 --> 06:12.570
Come here.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.441
I'll handle it.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.292
Hey, Street.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.626
We're rolling out in ten.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.295
Boots on the ground all day
at the festival.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.930
I got to talk to you
about something first.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.466
Last time this happened,
I screwed up real bad.

06:30.874 --> 06:34.303
And you know I'm-I'm so grateful
to be back on the team again.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.388
I would just never want
to compromise that

06:36.412 --> 06:37.439
or throw that away

06:37.463 --> 06:39.775
- for anything...
- Street, spit it out.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.560
It's my mom again.

06:41.584 --> 06:43.645
- What happened this time?
- I'm not sure.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.481
Closest we ever come to crossing anymore

06:45.505 --> 06:47.599
is when I slip rent money under the door.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.451
But she's AWOL.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.953
She hasn't checked in with her P.O.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.071
And if she misses one more meeting...

06:52.095 --> 06:54.323
They'll put out a warrant and revoke her.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.563
What do you think's going on?

06:57.442 --> 07:00.162
Last time we were together,
I found drugs.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.330
You think she's out there using?

07:01.354 --> 07:02.831
Maybe. Or maybe she's-she's

07:02.855 --> 07:05.267
just trying to guilt-trip me for
cutting her out of my life.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.668
But I am not taking off

07:06.692 --> 07:08.420
- to find out.
- Being committed to SWAT

07:08.444 --> 07:10.756
does not mean that you need
to stop caring about your mom.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.091
But you were right to come to me.

07:12.115 --> 07:13.425
We are a team.

07:13.449 --> 07:15.177
So let us look into it for you.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.262
We'll make some calls,
see if we can locate her.

07:17.286 --> 07:20.182
But in the meantime,
you focus on your work.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.301
All right.

07:21.900 --> 07:22.985
It's a sad morning,

07:23.009 --> 07:24.269
loyal listeners.

07:24.293 --> 07:25.521
Last night,

07:25.545 --> 07:27.263
there was an accident.

07:28.223 --> 07:30.275
Wildly different accounts
are being reported,

07:30.299 --> 07:33.362
but, uh, some sources say

07:33.386 --> 07:35.948
that two residents tried to coerce

07:35.972 --> 07:38.700
a peaceful protester into an altercation.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.003
The harassment continued, even as the man

07:41.027 --> 07:42.838
attempted to leave in his truck,

07:43.238 --> 07:45.541
causing a-a horrible collision.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.677
We're not even allowed
to watch respectfully

07:48.701 --> 07:50.712
- from the sidelines.
- Hey.

07:50.736 --> 07:51.854
This is private property.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.018
And now this driver's

07:56.042 --> 07:57.386
being tried and convicted

07:57.410 --> 08:00.522
in the media before
all the facts are available.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.891
Hey, how many people are working today?

08:02.915 --> 08:04.623
We all know how intolerant

08:04.647 --> 08:06.228
the other side is.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.646
Love All?

08:07.670 --> 08:09.231
Yeah, right.

08:09.255 --> 08:13.402
Love only those
who think exactly like them.

08:13.935 --> 08:15.770
Why don't we break for commercial?

08:23.853 --> 08:26.937
Time to pay for your crimes.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.523
You have to see this.

08:31.036 --> 08:33.422
My name is Micah Sherlock.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.256
Last night,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.727
an act of violence was committed
against my community.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.429
Two innocent people were attacked

08:40.453 --> 08:42.597
just because of who they loved.

08:42.621 --> 08:43.849
And this...

08:43.873 --> 08:46.685
hate-monger has you convinced
that we're the problem.

08:47.385 --> 08:48.937
We're not.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.856
But you brought the fight to us.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.358
If I receive word of any acts of hate

08:53.382 --> 08:55.194
being committed today at our parade,

08:55.218 --> 08:57.779
I will start killing hostages.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.114
Members of my community,

08:59.138 --> 09:00.699
be vigilant, call in.

09:00.723 --> 09:02.284
To the authorities,

09:02.308 --> 09:04.453
I dare you to disconnect
this transmission.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.954
As long as we all play nice,

09:05.978 --> 09:07.623
no one will get hurt.

09:08.434 --> 09:11.282
We're done being bullied
and pushed around.

09:15.609 --> 09:16.954
Mission's changed.

10:12.535 --> 10:14.910
All right, we got an I.D.
on our gunman. Micah Sherlock.

10:14.934 --> 10:16.398
29-year-old financial advisor.

10:16.422 --> 10:18.183
No prior history of violent behavior.

10:18.207 --> 10:20.402
Photos of him at just about
every rally of last year.

10:20.426 --> 10:22.640
Hold on, this guy's
an LGBTQ Straight Shooter.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.162
- Straight Shooter?
- Yeah, it's a West Hollywood

10:24.187 --> 10:25.254
gun rights group.

10:25.278 --> 10:26.908
They get together and shoot
once a week, run drills.

10:26.932 --> 10:28.076
They're pretty badass.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.277
So, he's got an agenda and he's trained?

10:29.301 --> 10:30.912
All right, so we know he's dangerous.

10:30.936 --> 10:32.747
We'll take our cues from
him on how this goes.

10:32.771 --> 10:34.388
Let's get over to Mobile Command.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.758
Trista, I haven't seen
you since WeHo Dodgeball.

10:43.782 --> 10:45.794
- What are you doing here?
- I know him.

10:45.818 --> 10:48.213
Micah, I mean.
We're in the same shooting club.

10:48.237 --> 10:50.265
- You're a Straight Shooter, too?
- I want to help.

10:50.289 --> 10:51.675
Let me talk to him.

10:51.699 --> 10:53.969
Micah's an angry guy, but he's not bad.

10:53.993 --> 10:55.804
He can be talked down.

10:55.828 --> 10:58.557
Please. Don't let him die for this.

10:58.581 --> 11:01.443
We'll do our best, but
ultimately, it's up to him.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.707
You hear that?

11:06.839 --> 11:08.984
That's my loyal patriots,

11:09.008 --> 11:11.620
circling the studio, waging war

11:11.644 --> 11:14.489
- to reclaim their country.
- Oh!

11:14.513 --> 11:17.125
They would stop calling in a
second if you asked them to.

11:17.149 --> 11:19.294
They'd do anything for you.

11:19.318 --> 11:21.580
Yet you choose to spread hate.

11:21.604 --> 11:23.632
You don't even believe any of this crap.

11:23.656 --> 11:25.133
No, I believe everything I say.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.501
'Cause it's all the truth,

11:26.525 --> 11:28.241
whether you want to hear it or not.

11:29.995 --> 11:31.778
So you believe that couple
should have been run over?

11:35.701 --> 11:36.956
Your followers

11:36.980 --> 11:38.234
are just looking for someone to hate

11:38.258 --> 11:40.315
other than themselves,

11:40.339 --> 11:42.183
and you're pointing the biggest
finger in our direction.

11:42.207 --> 11:44.925
Well, you're the one pointing a gun.

11:46.551 --> 11:48.228
Those doors are locked
with an encrypted key.

11:48.252 --> 11:50.197
There's no way we're getting
inside without breaking in.

11:50.221 --> 11:51.732
Storm is one paranoid piece of work.

11:51.756 --> 11:54.034
The windows are a special
tinted material, too.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.903
Bulletproof and impossible to see inside.

11:55.927 --> 11:57.321
Doesn't surprise me,
a guy who wants to put

11:57.345 --> 11:59.656
a target on half the country's
afraid to have one put on him.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.708
His fear of getting killed is
making it impossible

12:01.732 --> 12:02.709
for us to save his ass.

12:02.733 --> 12:03.911
Cortez is back at HQ working

12:03.935 --> 12:05.245
on a direct connection inside.

12:05.269 --> 12:06.580
Commander, I think I can help.

12:06.604 --> 12:08.041
Let me be the one to negotiate with him.

12:08.065 --> 12:09.917
You don't have the
experience of others here.

12:09.941 --> 12:11.538
This isn't a situation
to cut your teeth on.

12:11.562 --> 12:13.887
He's confused and angry
about what happened last night.

12:13.911 --> 12:15.422
He just needs to talk to somebody

12:15.446 --> 12:17.219
he can connect with,
understand his fears.

12:17.243 --> 12:20.093
We've got a hostage situation
broadcast live. The whole world

12:20.117 --> 12:23.545
will hear everything you say, and
pounce on any mistakes you make.

12:23.569 --> 12:26.121
I get the situation, but I also get him.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.738
Sir, she is our best shot.

12:31.762 --> 12:33.762
And I'll be right here to have her back.

12:37.802 --> 12:39.780
All right, let's get to it then.

12:39.804 --> 12:41.114
I want the rest of your team ready

12:41.138 --> 12:42.325
in case this thing goes sideways.

12:42.349 --> 12:44.201
All right, Luca, Street, get
into position to blow the door.

12:44.225 --> 12:45.586
Have Deacon on standby to cut the power.

12:45.610 --> 12:47.754
- Got it, man.
- Tan?

12:47.778 --> 12:49.028
Prep the drone.

13:10.751 --> 13:13.280
Studio blueprint's coming
into Command now, sir.

13:13.304 --> 13:16.400
Drone signal's strong.
Tan, keep it steady.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.675
All right, we got a line.
Alonzo, you ready?

13:23.598 --> 13:24.658
Micah, my name is

13:24.682 --> 13:26.326
Christina Alonzo with LAPD SWAT.

13:26.350 --> 13:28.161
I said callers reporting crimes only.

13:28.185 --> 13:29.830
- On-Only crimes!
- Micah, please.

13:29.854 --> 13:31.798
We're trying to end this
before anybody gets hurt.

13:31.822 --> 13:33.467
If you leave us alone, no one will.

13:33.491 --> 13:35.002
We both know that's not true.

13:35.026 --> 13:36.503
Some Storm Chaser fan
could retaliate for this,

13:36.527 --> 13:39.107
which means more of us
could be hurt or killed.

13:39.131 --> 13:40.340
Us?

13:40.364 --> 13:42.759
I'm a part of the LGBTQ community, too.

13:42.783 --> 13:45.429
I understand why you're angry.
I really do.

13:45.453 --> 13:47.681
Micah, I need to know how many
people you're holding in there.

13:47.705 --> 13:49.099
Five.

13:49.123 --> 13:51.351
Six if you include the devil himself.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.820
Oh. Now I'm the devil?

13:53.844 --> 13:55.355
You assault my whole team,

13:55.379 --> 13:57.024
you threaten me on a live broadcast.

13:57.048 --> 13:59.039
The police aren't here to rescue you.

13:59.063 --> 14:00.661
Shut up!

14:00.685 --> 14:02.112
He's right.

14:02.136 --> 14:04.531
You're here to protect him.
You're not one of us!

14:04.555 --> 14:06.500
Sir, I got a visual.

14:06.524 --> 14:08.502
- There's seven inside.
- I just got word from Deac.

14:08.526 --> 14:09.870
Water and Power standing by

14:09.894 --> 14:11.288
for a complete shutdown of the facility.

14:11.312 --> 14:13.040
Tan, prep the door for a breach.

14:13.064 --> 14:14.875
We cut the power, we go in hard,
and we isolate Micah

14:14.899 --> 14:16.775
- before he even knows we're there.
- I can talk him down.

14:16.799 --> 14:18.178
We're not gonna make a move
unless we have to.

14:18.202 --> 14:19.618
You're doing great, Chris. Keep going.

14:22.011 --> 14:23.050
Micah,

14:23.074 --> 14:25.852
trust me, I want to punish that
man who ran over those people.

14:25.876 --> 14:27.604
Storm is just as responsible.

14:27.628 --> 14:28.639
The driver is probably long gone,

14:28.663 --> 14:30.927
but Storm is still here spewing out hate.

14:30.951 --> 14:33.360
They insult us. They
attack us in our neighborhood,

14:33.384 --> 14:35.028
protest our events.

14:35.052 --> 14:37.731
But when we band together,
when we stand together,

14:37.755 --> 14:39.700
they call us the problem.

14:39.724 --> 14:41.364
They call us the instigators.

14:42.365 --> 14:44.821
Can't you see you're giving him
what he wants right now?

14:45.137 --> 14:47.604
You're proving his point.

15:00.778 --> 15:03.146
There's another call...

15:03.170 --> 15:05.092
someone claiming to be the driver
from last night.

15:05.116 --> 15:06.999
- You don't want to answer that.
- Hondo, your team ready?

15:09.934 --> 15:12.065
I want to make something clear.

15:12.089 --> 15:14.768
I hit those perverts last night.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.404
My actions were my own.

15:17.428 --> 15:19.606
Of course you would blame Mark Storm.

15:19.630 --> 15:21.608
He's one of the only people

15:21.632 --> 15:24.244
brave enough to speak the truth
and call you out

15:24.268 --> 15:25.746
for your hypocrisy.

15:25.770 --> 15:28.615
You people are so desperate
to be oppressed

15:28.639 --> 15:31.368
because it's the only way
you can get attention.

15:31.392 --> 15:32.619
I'm not the one running away.

15:32.643 --> 15:33.920
I'm not the one hiding from anyone.

15:33.944 --> 15:35.622
Good.

15:35.646 --> 15:38.458
They'll know who to blame
when I take out the next one.

15:38.482 --> 15:42.262
In fact, I'm looking at some
of you freaks right now.

15:42.286 --> 15:44.715
Remember, you put this into motion

15:44.739 --> 15:46.392
when you assaulted an innocent man.

15:49.827 --> 15:51.043
Cut the power.

15:52.163 --> 15:53.774
LAPD SWAT!

15:53.798 --> 15:55.442
Show me your hands!

15:55.466 --> 15:56.476
Down on the ground, now!

15:56.500 --> 15:57.978
LAPD SWAT! On the ground!

15:58.002 --> 15:59.346
Two. Two. Two.

15:59.370 --> 16:01.081
Okay. You're okay.

16:01.105 --> 16:02.816
- Everybody good?
- Good.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.951
This is 20-David to Command.
Turn the power back on.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.623
Hostages are secure.

16:09.647 --> 16:11.324
Suspect in custody.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.629
Get him out of here!

16:15.653 --> 16:17.798
- Get him out of here!
- That's right.

16:17.822 --> 16:19.332
All right, Storm Chasers!

16:19.356 --> 16:21.501
- All right, Storm! Storm!
- Thank you.

16:21.525 --> 16:22.919
Thank you for your support,
Storm Chasers!

16:22.943 --> 16:24.337
Yeah! Yeah, Storm. Go, buddy.

16:24.361 --> 16:25.972
- Fight the good fight!
- Yeah!

16:25.996 --> 16:28.508
Hey! Hey! Hey! You're that SWAT lesbian

16:28.532 --> 16:31.011
who was on the phone.
Look what he did to Storm!

16:31.035 --> 16:32.813
- Why didn't you stop him sooner?
- Watch it, moron!

16:32.837 --> 16:35.515
She will kick your ass and
send you back to Kansas!

16:38.292 --> 16:39.352
All right, go, go, go!

16:54.854 --> 16:57.615
Those shots came from a parking
garage about 100 yards away.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.067
Studio's been secured.

16:59.091 --> 17:01.877
RHD swept the sniper's nest.
Guy was in and out.

17:01.902 --> 17:03.630
They managed to pull a single print

17:03.654 --> 17:04.683
from the ledge he was perched.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.627
Matches the one pulled from the
hit-and-run truck this morning.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.371
So the sniper and the hit-and-run
driver are the same person.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.333
At least that's one less person
we need to be looking for.

17:11.357 --> 17:13.252
Yeah, but he's still out there,
and now he's killed someone.

17:13.276 --> 17:15.170
The Love All Festival's been put
on hold while the city

17:15.194 --> 17:16.919
determines how to handle the situation.

17:16.943 --> 17:18.813
They can't do that. That means he wins.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.842
We got a killer on the loose.

17:19.866 --> 17:21.175
Frankly, we should
cancel the whole thing.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.594
If this guy's a loyal Storm Chaser,

17:22.617 --> 17:24.847
maybe today wasn't the first
time he called into the show.

17:24.871 --> 17:25.981
We're keeping Storm here while

17:26.005 --> 17:27.316
things cool off. It's worth asking.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.152
- Hondo, I want Storm.
- Chris, no.

17:30.176 --> 17:31.687
I want you to reach out to your friend

17:31.711 --> 17:33.355
and find out what's going
with those Straight Shooters.

17:33.379 --> 17:34.773
We're already hearing
they're looking to retaliate

17:34.797 --> 17:36.692
for Micah's death,
and we have to keep the peace.

17:36.716 --> 17:39.027
Just because we tell people
to stay away from Love All

17:39.051 --> 17:40.829
doesn't mean they're gonna listen.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.664
If they do restart the festival,

17:42.688 --> 17:44.666
I want us ready. Let's
get everyone else back

17:44.690 --> 17:46.273
to the parade route, secure the streets.

17:48.227 --> 17:49.831
- Hey, Tan.
- Yo.

17:49.855 --> 17:51.123
On your way, I want you to stop by

17:51.147 --> 17:53.208
Street's old place and check on his mom.

17:53.232 --> 17:54.793
Her P.O. hasn't seen her
and he's worried.

17:54.817 --> 17:56.128
- This is the spare key.
- Damn.

17:56.152 --> 17:57.379
He hasn't mentioned her for a while.

17:57.403 --> 17:59.131
Was hoping that meant
everything was okay.

17:59.155 --> 18:00.883
All right, I'll stop by,
find out what's up.

18:00.907 --> 18:03.051
- Appreciate it.
- My house is worth

18:03.075 --> 18:04.853
way more than that.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.722
All I'm asking for is $11,000.

18:06.746 --> 18:07.912
How can you say no to that?

18:09.832 --> 18:12.728
What? No, I don't have any other
properties to put up as well.

18:12.752 --> 18:13.993
Is that a joke?

18:15.721 --> 18:17.733
Yeah, you know what? Never mind.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.568
Hey, Captain wants us down at the parade.

18:19.592 --> 18:20.903
Yeah.

18:20.927 --> 18:22.237
Everything all right with the baby?

18:22.261 --> 18:23.488
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

18:23.512 --> 18:26.158
Just, you know, paperwork
and... But she's great.

18:26.182 --> 18:28.877
- We're all great.
- Look, If you need more cash,

18:28.901 --> 18:30.379
Street wants a hot tub,

18:30.403 --> 18:32.080
but I'd rather put it to better use, man.

18:32.104 --> 18:34.750
You've done more than enough
and we're eternally grateful.

18:35.264 --> 18:36.418
And-and, in fact,

18:36.442 --> 18:37.920
I'm gonna be able to start
paying you back soon

18:37.944 --> 18:39.171
with OT coming back.

18:39.195 --> 18:41.006
I meant it when I said no rush.

18:41.030 --> 18:43.080
I mean, babies bring bills, right?

18:45.451 --> 18:47.943
Y-Your cash, it...

18:48.454 --> 18:50.432
it got us back on track,

18:51.089 --> 18:52.505
and I thank you.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.940
But... a man's got to carry his family

18:57.964 --> 18:59.163
on his own two feet.

19:00.466 --> 19:02.041
Otherwise he's not a man.

19:03.970 --> 19:06.248
- I don't know, I-I might...
- You know what?

19:06.272 --> 19:07.616
I told Chris that I'd back her

19:07.640 --> 19:09.751
with her Straight Shooter
friends, so, uh...

19:09.775 --> 19:11.119
we'll meet you there.

19:11.143 --> 19:12.476
All right.

19:15.114 --> 19:16.758
Sorry to leave you in here like this,

19:16.782 --> 19:19.795
but, as you can imagine,
we got a lot going on today.

19:19.819 --> 19:21.296
Not at all.

19:21.644 --> 19:23.799
Like to see that crowd
try to come at me in here.

19:23.823 --> 19:26.468
People try to kill you a lot?

19:26.941 --> 19:29.972
- Price of speaking the truth.
- Hmm.

19:29.996 --> 19:32.641
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind sharing
some more of that truth then.

19:32.665 --> 19:33.797
Help us out.

19:35.668 --> 19:37.396
That wacko's dead.

19:37.420 --> 19:38.780
What is there to figure out?

19:38.804 --> 19:41.400
Unless you think I know who shot him.

19:41.424 --> 19:43.986
The man who saved my life?

19:44.010 --> 19:45.988
We actually saved your life.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.827
I have a lot of friends like you.

19:51.851 --> 19:53.300
Cops, I mean.

19:53.853 --> 19:55.247
They call into the show all the time.

19:55.271 --> 19:56.999
Must be tough...

19:57.023 --> 20:00.802
being police in the People's
Republic of Los Angeles.

20:00.826 --> 20:04.006
These people they, they ask
the-the law for protection,

20:04.030 --> 20:07.009
and then they turn around
and call the cops killers.

20:07.033 --> 20:09.311
As if this job wasn't hard enough

20:09.335 --> 20:12.648
for... you know, a guy with your roots.

20:12.672 --> 20:14.470
Hmm.

20:14.494 --> 20:15.817
Well, then why don't you do me a solid...

20:16.198 --> 20:17.819
who is the shooter?

20:17.843 --> 20:19.259
Do you recognize that voice?

20:21.380 --> 20:22.546
I get a lot of calls.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.132
I got nothing that can help you.

20:32.391 --> 20:33.835
Thanks for coming.

20:33.859 --> 20:36.004
We can talk in here away from the crowd.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.840
- Why'd you call me in, Chris?
- We got a report that you were

20:38.864 --> 20:40.876
handing out ammo to members
of the gun club.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.349
Tell me that's not true.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.014
We're going to protect the parade.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.849
There's nothing illegal
about giving away ammo.

20:47.873 --> 20:50.032
It's not your job to
protect the city. It's ours.

20:50.056 --> 20:51.720
Whatever training you
and your friends have,

20:51.744 --> 20:54.690
you're still amateurs. Just let SWAT...

20:54.714 --> 20:56.997
What did SWAT do for Micah?

20:58.617 --> 21:01.596
He was in police custody
and he still got shot.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.982
Or how about those two people
who were run over?

21:04.006 --> 21:07.069
You promised me
you would do your best, Chris.

21:07.093 --> 21:08.876
Is that what this is?

21:10.878 --> 21:13.041
My friend is gone.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.576
I'm sick of waiting

21:14.600 --> 21:17.412
for everyone
to finally give us some respect.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.603
Aren't you?

21:32.483 --> 21:34.151
Place is pretty amazing.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.765
It's changed a lot in four years.

21:37.279 --> 21:38.934
Looks like it's been 40.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.268
It's very, um...

21:40.292 --> 21:41.770
Minority Report.

21:42.326 --> 21:43.605
What are you doing here?

21:43.629 --> 21:44.773
Honestly, Dad,

21:44.797 --> 21:46.108
really didn't want to come down here.

21:46.132 --> 21:47.743
But my friends
that are putting on Love All,

21:47.767 --> 21:49.778
they know that you have the city's ear

21:49.802 --> 21:51.246
and they were hoping I could get you

21:51.270 --> 21:52.864
to convince them to reopen it.

21:52.888 --> 21:54.366
Well, maybe it should stay closed.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.034
A lot of people are in danger.

21:56.058 --> 21:59.037
Dad, that's why
we have events like these.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.756
For Pride.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.125
You know, stand up to hate.

22:03.639 --> 22:05.460
Well, you could get hurt.

22:05.484 --> 22:06.928
Come on, don't hide behind that.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.047
We both know you don't care
about what happens to me.

22:09.071 --> 22:10.215
Oh, don't be dramatic.

22:10.239 --> 22:11.992
Oh, no, your gay son
is being so dramatic.

22:12.016 --> 22:14.302
- I'm so sorry, Dad!
- Enough. Enough.

22:14.326 --> 22:16.221
You know it's never been about that.

22:16.245 --> 22:18.106
Things were rough way
before you came out.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.942
And even that I had to
hear from your mother.

22:20.966 --> 22:23.612
It's not like you were exactly
easy to communicate with.

22:23.636 --> 22:25.280
I was a tough dad.

22:25.304 --> 22:26.648
So what?

22:26.672 --> 22:28.316
You did drugs in my house

22:28.340 --> 22:30.249
when our family was falling apart.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.321
I was falling apart.

22:33.345 --> 22:35.490
Mom was the only thing
holding me together.

22:35.514 --> 22:36.741
She meant everything to me.

22:36.765 --> 22:38.460
And she didn't to me?

22:39.299 --> 22:40.567
Did I fall apart?

22:42.261 --> 22:45.000
Love of my life dead.

22:45.024 --> 22:46.968
My daughter on the other
side of the country.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.600
My son, high as a...

22:51.167 --> 22:52.174
But I kept it together.

22:52.198 --> 22:55.115
That's the man I was
trying to raise you as.

22:56.535 --> 22:59.514
We both know
that I'm not the man you tried

22:59.538 --> 23:01.183
to raise me to be.

23:01.207 --> 23:04.853
But this community, this event
that you're trying to shut down

23:04.877 --> 23:08.607
is what I needed to get myself clean.

23:08.631 --> 23:10.380
To get my life back.

23:11.749 --> 23:13.851
That's who I'm proud to be.

23:18.213 --> 23:19.773
Whatever you'll do, you'll do.

23:26.532 --> 23:27.959
We need to shut down
your friend's operation

23:27.983 --> 23:29.711
- before this turns violent.
- I told the captain,

23:29.735 --> 23:31.296
but they're not actually
breaking any laws.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.631
Why don't we just head
over to the festival

23:32.655 --> 23:33.882
and see what else we can do to help.

23:33.906 --> 23:35.851
This is not the time for politics.

23:35.875 --> 23:38.186
Don't you at least see
where they're coming from?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.021
You heard those protesters
outside of the studio.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.640
Yeah. There's a lot of hate
out there. I get it.

23:41.664 --> 23:43.525
But taking Storm hostage,
that didn't solve anything,

23:43.549 --> 23:45.026
and neither will shooting up the streets.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.811
Your friends need to sit their asses down

23:46.835 --> 23:48.864
- and let us handle this.
- You've never felt unprotected

23:48.888 --> 23:50.565
by the police before. What if some nutjob

23:50.589 --> 23:51.816
threatened to blow up your church?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.068
How would you feel then?

23:53.092 --> 23:54.402
- Hey. Don't bring my faith into this.
- Why not?

23:54.426 --> 23:55.871
What makes you so special?

23:55.895 --> 23:57.539
Why don't we matter, too?

23:57.563 --> 23:59.407
My faith teaches
that we all deserve love.

23:59.922 --> 24:02.210
And Storm will face reckoning
for his hate.

24:02.758 --> 24:04.663
But more lives,

24:04.687 --> 24:06.081
any lives,

24:06.105 --> 24:08.305
they don't have to end because of this.

24:10.776 --> 24:13.171
Chris, you're fed up. I get it.

24:13.894 --> 24:15.507
But don't give in to it.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.031
The stronger side will prevail.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.597
All right, listen,
I'll-I'll meet you down there.

24:22.621 --> 24:24.266
I got a couple of business owners

24:24.290 --> 24:25.850
I want to meet along the parade route.

24:25.874 --> 24:27.201
You sure you don't need backup for that?

24:27.225 --> 24:29.070
No. No, I know a couple of
these guys from back in the day.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.544
It's probably best if I go alone.

24:51.265 --> 24:53.545
They told me there'd be random check-ins.

24:53.569 --> 24:55.630
Wasn't expecting
the guy who arrested me, though.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.133
Officer Kay.

24:58.157 --> 24:59.356
Mickey.

25:00.274 --> 25:01.469
Yeah, just checking the neighborhood

25:01.493 --> 25:03.104
since the attack this morning.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.806
Asking if anyone saw anything suspicious,

25:04.830 --> 25:07.928
handing out cards.
Canvassing a little deep.

25:07.952 --> 25:10.312
The hit-and-run
was half a mile from here.

25:10.659 --> 25:12.035
And I don't want your card.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.007
So, uh, gold and fast loans, huh?

25:19.084 --> 25:21.239
That's basically what
you were doing before.

25:21.263 --> 25:22.838
Only legal now.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.328
That's actually why I'm here.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.330
I need a loan.

25:28.354 --> 25:30.591
Today. Right now. Off the books.

25:30.615 --> 25:31.967
I just told you, I'm aboveboard now.

25:31.991 --> 25:33.635
Good. I don't want dirty money.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.003
Just a straight-up loan.

25:35.559 --> 25:37.088
Have a good day, Officer Kay.

25:37.112 --> 25:38.562
Hey. Hey, look.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.344
No wire. This isn't a setup.

25:42.368 --> 25:43.595
Not interested.

25:43.619 --> 25:45.680
- If you need cash, go to a bank.
- I tried.

25:45.704 --> 25:47.682
Now I can't get a bank to touch me.

25:48.363 --> 25:50.602
And my baby girl doesn't have
time for me to wait for weeks

25:50.626 --> 25:52.409
for my credit union to come through.

25:52.961 --> 25:56.524
$11,000 is all I need.

25:57.164 --> 25:59.099
I'll be back on my feet in a month,

25:59.124 --> 26:00.809
and you'll have it all back
with interest.

26:00.834 --> 26:01.997
There's got to be
somebody else you can ask.

26:02.021 --> 26:03.615
- There isn't.
- Not a single person?

26:03.639 --> 26:05.867
Another cop? Uh, some second cousin?

26:05.891 --> 26:07.702
Already dipped into that well.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.635
That's the problem.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.674
Huh.

26:12.698 --> 26:15.394
No, the problem is, is you
don't want anybody to know

26:15.418 --> 26:17.712
you're having money trouble;
I see it all the time.

26:17.736 --> 26:19.714
- You don't know what I'm going through.
- It's the same story.

26:19.738 --> 26:22.851
You're too embarrassed
to admit that you need help,

26:22.875 --> 26:24.686
to tell your pals
or your wife that you couldn't

26:24.710 --> 26:26.485
solve everything on your own.

26:28.737 --> 26:31.192
But coming to me...

26:31.408 --> 26:32.824
is gonna make it worse.

26:34.336 --> 26:36.481
There's a reason
God made pride a deadly sin.

26:36.505 --> 26:39.373
I don't need a lecture, I need cash.

26:46.129 --> 26:49.411
$11,000 wired into this bank account.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.380
I will pay you back and I accept

26:52.404 --> 26:54.654
all the consequences
that come if I don't.

27:01.561 --> 27:04.843
I know how hard you
worked setting this all up,

27:04.867 --> 27:07.095
but we need to shut it down.

27:07.119 --> 27:08.680
Mrs. Mayor, that's not gonna make

27:08.704 --> 27:10.515
the thousands of LGBTQ people who've come

27:10.539 --> 27:12.350
from all across the country go away.

27:12.374 --> 27:15.103
It's not gonna make
the protestors go away either.

27:15.127 --> 27:16.738
But I don't want to give everyone

27:16.762 --> 27:18.773
an excuse to concentrate

27:18.797 --> 27:21.743
on the same street
with a sniper out there.

27:21.767 --> 27:24.446
- What is SWAT's take on this?
- We're close to identifying

27:24.470 --> 27:26.448
the shooter; we got
every unit working on it.

27:26.472 --> 27:28.783
Whether the festival
is on or not, no one's safe

27:28.807 --> 27:31.453
- until we bring him in.
- Cancelling Love All

27:31.477 --> 27:33.455
is clearly what this nut wants.

27:33.479 --> 27:35.095
Do we really want to give him that?

27:36.281 --> 27:38.960
People don't come to these
events for the party.

27:39.308 --> 27:41.296
They come to feel supported,

27:41.320 --> 27:42.964
maybe for the first time in their lives,

27:42.988 --> 27:45.455
meet someone else just like them.

27:46.575 --> 27:47.886
You know...

27:47.910 --> 27:49.471
you don't cancel the Super Bowl

27:49.495 --> 27:51.940
because of a bomb threat;
you stop the threat.

27:51.964 --> 27:53.975
We'll do whatever we have to.

27:54.917 --> 27:56.644
Okay, we'll reopen it.

27:56.668 --> 27:59.114
But I don't want one casualty.

27:59.138 --> 28:01.116
SWAT's not in the business
of letting this city down.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.622
Then don't.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.962
I'm helping tech listen to Storm's show.

28:13.986 --> 28:16.164
- Guy's on, like, six hours a day.
- Hmm.

28:16.188 --> 28:17.582
You got a sec?

28:17.606 --> 28:18.833
It's about your mom.

28:18.857 --> 28:20.301
Yeah.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.753
Chris checked with your mom's job.

28:22.184 --> 28:23.755
She hasn't been seen in over two weeks.

28:23.779 --> 28:26.007
Tan went to her place, now we
don't know what to make of it,

28:26.031 --> 28:27.926
but there was spoiled food
that hadn't been cleared yet.

28:27.950 --> 28:29.978
There was no forced entry
or any sign of violence.

28:30.002 --> 28:31.908
But Tan did find some
pills next to her bed.

28:31.932 --> 28:33.400
Heart meds. She takes heart meds daily,

28:33.425 --> 28:35.174
she wouldn't have skipped town
without 'em.

28:35.199 --> 28:36.937
I checked with some cop buddies
of mine and local morgues.

28:36.961 --> 28:38.935
Nobody's turned up matching
your mother's description.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.272
So we don't know what's wrong,
just that something's not right.

28:41.296 --> 28:43.525
Street, have you ever considered filing
a missing person's report?

28:43.549 --> 28:44.943
Have people on the ground
looking for her.

28:44.967 --> 28:47.028
- Take it off your plate.
- And then if it turns out

28:47.052 --> 28:49.152
she really is violating her parole?

28:49.176 --> 28:51.115
I'll have basically sent
her back to prison myself.

28:51.139 --> 28:53.117
Even though we may have
butted heads for how

28:53.141 --> 28:55.286
you handled it before,
I always respected you

28:55.310 --> 28:57.172
for doing right by your mom.

28:57.196 --> 28:58.445
Don't ever lose that.

29:02.234 --> 29:05.213
Oh, does this mean it's finally safe

29:05.237 --> 29:07.966
for me to go out into the real world?

29:07.990 --> 29:10.385
There's a lot of people out
there still looking to hurt you.

29:10.409 --> 29:12.220
Always will be when you're not afraid

29:12.244 --> 29:13.402
to speak the truth.

29:14.463 --> 29:15.807
They celebrate bakers

29:15.831 --> 29:17.725
who refuse to make a Swastika cake.

29:17.749 --> 29:20.361
They are a threat to free speech itself.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.147
That was another Dennis Deep State Dive.

29:23.171 --> 29:24.399
Thank you as always, Dennis.

29:24.423 --> 29:26.201
I thought you never heard
that voice before.

29:26.225 --> 29:27.402
All right.

29:27.426 --> 29:30.154
Dennis calls into the show once a week.

29:30.178 --> 29:32.373
He's popular. So what?

29:32.397 --> 29:34.558
- I didn't tell him to do what he did.
- No, of course not.

29:34.582 --> 29:36.744
You never tell anyone to do
anything, not directly.

29:36.768 --> 29:38.162
You know exactly where the line is

29:38.186 --> 29:39.497
and how to fire up your listeners

29:39.521 --> 29:41.249
without crossing it.
But don't you stand here

29:41.273 --> 29:42.667
and try to pretend like you don't know

29:42.691 --> 29:44.669
- what your actions inspire.
- I'm passionate...

29:44.693 --> 29:46.054
all right, but I'm not violent.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.672
Words have meaning.

29:47.696 --> 29:49.173
And you knew exactly what you were doing

29:49.197 --> 29:51.092
when you picked yours
and now someone is dead.

29:51.481 --> 29:54.229
Do you want to be responsible for more?

29:54.985 --> 29:56.403
All right, look.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.905
Off the record, all right?
Dennis is not my buddy.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.406
I've never even met him in person.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.942
I can get you some screen names

30:07.967 --> 30:10.445
and access to private online groups,

30:10.469 --> 30:12.043
that might help you.

30:12.971 --> 30:14.699
Last week, he called me and told me

30:14.723 --> 30:17.418
he was coming to town
and invited me to speak

30:17.442 --> 30:19.454
at a rally of visiting Storm Chasers,

30:19.478 --> 30:22.257
- which I turned down of course...
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.205
You're telling me that he's not alone?

30:24.229 --> 30:26.283
He's got help with
whatever he's planning next?

30:27.786 --> 30:29.430
What next?

30:29.454 --> 30:32.467
No, no, no. No, he-he got what he wanted.

30:32.491 --> 30:34.469
Love All L.A. is... cancelled.

30:34.493 --> 30:36.876
It just reopened 15 minutes ago.

30:41.690 --> 30:43.167
People are showing up in full force.

30:43.191 --> 30:44.886
Well, the second we announced

30:44.910 --> 30:46.254
that Love All Festival was reopened,

30:46.278 --> 30:47.555
they flooded the streets.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.257
They want to march with
a shooter on the loose,

30:49.281 --> 30:50.862
a little rain's not gonna stop 'em now.

30:50.886 --> 30:53.168
HQ is tracking the screen
names Storm gave up.

30:53.192 --> 30:55.278
If Dennis is planning
something, we'll find out.

30:55.303 --> 30:57.432
We've got airships in the
sky, eyes on every roof,

30:57.456 --> 30:58.900
plain clothes in the crowds.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.707
He's not gonna get past us.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.072
Call JP.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.740
- Tell him to stay home.
-

31:05.764 --> 31:07.075
At least you'll know he's safe.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.693
He's never listened to me.

31:08.717 --> 31:10.745
He's probably at
the volunteer tent anyway.

31:10.769 --> 31:12.413
It's off the parade route, it's okay.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.248
I'm not worried about JP,
I'm worried about you.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.867
You need to be focused on this,

31:15.891 --> 31:18.274
- not your son's safety.
- I'm all over it.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.962
JP and I have never seen eye-to-eye,

31:27.986 --> 31:30.431
as far back as I can remember.

31:30.455 --> 31:32.433
I just, um...

31:32.457 --> 31:34.719
I never figured out how
to get through to him.

31:34.743 --> 31:36.888
The harder I pushed, the...

31:36.912 --> 31:39.640
the more he gravitated towards Barb.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.776
You didn't push him into drugs.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.644
And I'm sure you did everything

31:43.668 --> 31:45.218
you could to help him after.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.138
Did I?

31:49.508 --> 31:51.619
When Barb got close to the end,

31:51.643 --> 31:54.271
JP's addiction got worse.

31:55.772 --> 31:57.492
So I cut him off.

31:57.905 --> 32:00.461
He lashed out. He said horrible things.

32:00.902 --> 32:04.465
The last night he was with his
mom, the night before she, uh...

32:05.115 --> 32:08.469
before she passed, he went into her
room, he stole all her jewelry,

32:08.493 --> 32:09.804
and he took off.

32:10.287 --> 32:11.806
I'm so sorry.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.508
Eh.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.177
I was tough, because my
father was tough on me.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.012
And I was glad for it, you know,

32:18.036 --> 32:21.015
because it taught me
hard work and integrity.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.259
The things I tried to teach you.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.358
I'll always be grateful for the
captain you helped me become.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.359
Aw, come on.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.528
I needed you as my commander.

32:33.935 --> 32:37.053
But maybe JP needs something different.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.537
Man, most of these posts

32:42.561 --> 32:44.172
are just keyboard tough guy fantasies

32:44.196 --> 32:45.540
on ways to attack Love All.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.842
Gas leaks, pipe bombs, sniper nests.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.460
Some fantasies.

32:49.484 --> 32:51.462
They're using real street
maps and blueprints.

32:51.486 --> 32:53.347
And there's no way to pick out
which plan is real.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.715
It could be any of 'em.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.551
That address Dennis tried

32:56.575 --> 32:58.719
to get Storm to speak at,
it's a residence.

32:58.743 --> 32:59.720
Owner is a Dave Jansen.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.056
Lives alone,
works construction here in L.A.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.808
I spoke to his supervisor.
Three dump trucks

33:03.832 --> 33:05.526
were just hijacked from the site
that they're working on.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.694
Whoa, look at this post from Dennis,

33:06.718 --> 33:08.479
ten minutes after Love All
announced back open.

33:08.503 --> 33:10.865
"If they still want
to have their fun, then maybe

33:10.889 --> 33:12.233
we can still have ours. Who's with me?"

33:12.257 --> 33:14.202
This all started with a hit-and-run.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.264
They're gonna drive those
trucks straight into the crowd.

33:16.288 --> 33:18.990
Jansen's company has
all its trucks fitted with GPS.

33:19.014 --> 33:20.658
I'm sending you the locations now.

33:20.682 --> 33:22.827
Airships are up and have eyes on them.

33:22.851 --> 33:25.913
They're spread out and waiting
to ram the barricades in unison.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.249
It'll spread our resources
and create chaos.

33:28.273 --> 33:29.584
Well, that's not gonna happen.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.085
Everybody take a truck.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.054
Luca, Tan, you got
truck number one on Highland.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.339
Chris, Street, you got truck
number two on Franklin.

33:35.363 --> 33:36.841
Deacon, I'll meet you
at truck number three.

33:36.865 --> 33:38.509
Now, the roads are slick, y'all.
Stay alert.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.177
Tan, get ready, just in case.

33:43.121 --> 33:44.621
Coming up on truck one!

33:46.708 --> 33:48.214
You need to go now. They know.

33:48.238 --> 33:50.413
We need to all go at once.
I won't get through on my own.

33:50.437 --> 33:53.263
No, it's too late. Move to
Plan B. I'll hold 'em off. Go!

34:05.810 --> 34:07.028
He's gonna try it.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.723
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

34:25.746 --> 34:29.476
- Get out of the car! Go.
- Hands! Now! Hands!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.812
Get out. Down! Down!

34:31.835 --> 34:33.331
Hands behind your back!

34:33.355 --> 34:34.565
Hold.

34:34.589 --> 34:36.317
Hands.

34:36.341 --> 34:37.809
We're coming up on truck two.

34:43.431 --> 34:46.460
LAPD! Everyone drop your weapons! Now!

34:46.484 --> 34:47.828
Trista! Put down your guns!

34:47.851 --> 34:49.130
We got this.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.414
How'd you even find the truck?

34:50.438 --> 34:51.831
Police Scanner App.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.168
- Trista, we got him.
- And he just goes to jail?

34:54.192 --> 34:56.337
What justice is that? Micah was executed.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.756
No one deserves this. Not Micah, not him.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.642
- So you've picked their side?
- Stop thinking in sides.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.178
Micah didn't deserve to die,
but what he did was wrong.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.263
What this man was about to do is wrong,

35:06.287 --> 35:08.516
and he will pay for his crime.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.984
I know it doesn't seem fair,

35:10.008 --> 35:12.320
but if we want real change,

35:12.844 --> 35:14.677
we've got to be better.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.951
- Go.
- Drop it.

35:20.411 --> 35:22.389
Everyone drop your weapons! Now!

35:23.354 --> 35:25.199
Drop it!

35:25.223 --> 35:26.889
Out of the truck.

35:28.977 --> 35:30.810
Up against the wall.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.198
Give me your hand!

35:34.866 --> 35:37.712
Last truck is on the move. He's
headed away from the parade.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.964
He's not gonna break through
the barricades on his own.

35:39.988 --> 35:42.016
He missed his chance
on hitting the crowds.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.885
He can't be running now,
after all of this.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.721
Unless he has a backup target.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.023
Something not on the parade route.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.725
Parade's in the final stretch.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.393
Let's get those tarps over to the stage

35:52.417 --> 35:53.561
for the benefit concert.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.885
Rain or shine, people. Rain or shine.

36:00.431 --> 36:01.819
Even if we intercept, how
are we supposed to sto

36:01.843 --> 36:03.070
a truck going that fast?

36:03.094 --> 36:04.646
Only one way.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.075
- Need anything else?
- Nah, I think we're good.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.482
Awesome.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.855
Chris, Street, check on Deac!

36:37.879 --> 36:38.939
- Deac! Deacon!
- Deacon!

36:38.963 --> 36:40.908
- We're here!
- Deac!

36:41.980 --> 36:43.851
- You okay?
- You okay?

36:45.194 --> 36:46.727
I can't move.

37:04.194 --> 37:06.672
Oh, my God, you're hurt. Let me help.

37:06.697 --> 37:08.226
Dennis, don't move!

37:08.954 --> 37:12.350
Dennis, it's over, man.
We stopped the trucks.

37:12.374 --> 37:14.352
Come on, you're in bad shape. It's done.

37:14.376 --> 37:15.820
The only thing you're gonna do

37:15.844 --> 37:17.522
by not giving up is hurt one more person,

37:17.546 --> 37:20.024
and it can't be worth it just for that.

37:20.048 --> 37:22.573
- Don't even think about it.
- Let her go!

37:31.226 --> 37:32.837
See if she's okay.

37:33.651 --> 37:37.208
Come here. Come here, it's okay.
It's okay. I got you.

37:37.232 --> 37:38.365
You're safe.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.842
I heard what you did
with your friend back there.

37:59.218 --> 38:01.032
I'm sure that was hard.

38:01.721 --> 38:03.401
Where do you think this comes from?

38:04.807 --> 38:06.476
All this hate?

38:07.062 --> 38:08.769
I don't know, Chris.

38:09.431 --> 38:11.814
For some people it's just
the easiest way to feel,

38:12.901 --> 38:14.484
and it's infectious.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.755
All right, listen up. I just
heard from the paramedics.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.840
Deac just got to the hospital
and they're prepping him

38:25.864 --> 38:27.258
for surgery. Now they couldn't say much,

38:27.282 --> 38:29.677
but he was moving his toes
by the time they loaded him in.

38:29.701 --> 38:31.179
We'll know more in the next few hours.

38:31.203 --> 38:32.764
All right, no matter what,
Deac's gonna need us

38:32.788 --> 38:34.695
to help him pull through this.
You know, with the baby and all.

38:34.719 --> 38:37.088
We'll be there for them.
All we can do now is wait.

38:37.088 --> 38:38.566
In the meantime, Love
All is scheduled to resume

38:38.590 --> 38:41.090
for the rest of the night, so we
got a long shift ahead of us.

38:52.354 --> 38:55.800
I, uh, I couldn't find you
over at the, uh, volunteer tent

38:55.824 --> 38:57.610
after the crash. I...

38:58.326 --> 38:59.921
I didn't know if you were there.

38:59.945 --> 39:04.258
Oh, uh, thank you for checking in on me.

39:04.282 --> 39:07.537
Yeah, I mean, you know, your sister...

39:09.664 --> 39:11.681
She's always let me know
how you've been doing.

39:11.705 --> 39:15.925
I mean, I never reached out,
but I always knew you were okay.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.525
I didn't mean what I said earlier.

39:21.165 --> 39:22.227
You know, about you not caring.

39:22.251 --> 39:23.780
- That's, uh...
- I'm sorry.

39:23.804 --> 39:25.446
Let's-let's not start in
on the apologies.

39:25.470 --> 39:27.665
That's-that's too deep of a well.

39:27.689 --> 39:31.307
All right? We've already,
we've already lost enough time.

39:33.896 --> 39:36.813
Mom was the only thing holding
me together, you know that?

39:38.900 --> 39:41.045
- I know.
- And when she got sick,

39:42.905 --> 39:46.450
when I knew that we were gonna lose her,

39:47.429 --> 39:48.453
I spiraled.

39:48.477 --> 39:50.955
I know, I know it.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.993
Because, to me, that...

39:55.017 --> 39:56.669
it felt like I'd have no one.

39:58.337 --> 40:00.798
Yeah, but you-you didn't have to leave.

40:00.822 --> 40:02.341
You could've let me try.

40:04.343 --> 40:08.840
You did try, my whole life.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.142
And I tried, too.

40:11.166 --> 40:13.678
And for whatever reason,
we just, we didn't connect.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.179
- Just...
- But maybe now that we...

40:15.203 --> 40:18.816
It just kills me. It just, it just,

40:18.840 --> 40:20.268
it kills me that you thought

40:20.292 --> 40:22.153
that she was the only one who loved you.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.449
Listen, the truth is,

40:27.132 --> 40:30.703
she just was the only one
that could show it, you know?

40:35.082 --> 40:37.035
I really miss her.

40:37.059 --> 40:38.419
I know.

40:39.361 --> 40:42.479
Me, too. Every day.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.061
No, no, no, no, no, no.

41:03.085 --> 41:06.564
Hi. So a few vertebrae in your spine

41:06.588 --> 41:08.232
were compressed in the accident.

41:08.256 --> 41:10.234
We rushed you into surgery
to relieve the pressure.

41:10.258 --> 41:12.070
You're gonna be fine, Mr. Kay.

41:12.094 --> 41:15.239
You're gonna be fine, and so is Victoria.

41:15.263 --> 41:17.992
They put a shunt in as soon
as you deposited the money

41:18.016 --> 41:21.079
in the account, so we're gonna
get to take her home tomorrow.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.622
Will I be out of here by then?

41:23.646 --> 41:25.717
We'll have you in the chair in
time to take your daughter home.

41:25.741 --> 41:27.919
- The chair?
- Sorry, that sounded worse than it is.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.387
It's while you heal from the surgery.

41:29.411 --> 41:30.588
You'll be back on your feet

41:30.612 --> 41:33.384
in a couple days, and in
two to three months,

41:33.408 --> 41:34.926
you should be at 100%,

41:34.950 --> 41:37.228
- ready to get back in the field.
- 100%, babe.

41:37.252 --> 41:39.514
But, wait, I can't work
for two to three months?

41:39.538 --> 41:40.932
You might be able to cut that time down

41:40.956 --> 41:42.943
if you work hard
at your physical therapy.

41:42.967 --> 41:46.020
It's gonna be a long road
to full recovery,

41:46.044 --> 41:47.355
but there's nothing

41:47.379 --> 41:49.857
stopping you from normal,
low-stress office duties.

41:49.881 --> 41:51.743
No field work? No OT?

41:51.767 --> 41:53.578
Don't sweat the money right now.

41:53.602 --> 41:55.446
Okay? You, uh, you
just stopped an attack,

41:55.470 --> 41:57.615
survived something horrible.

41:57.639 --> 42:00.585
Figured out a way to fix
our daughter's heart.

42:00.609 --> 42:02.286
Today is a blessing.

42:03.087 --> 42:06.758
Hey, everything's gonna
be okay from here on out.

42:06.782 --> 42:08.865
Okay? I promise.
