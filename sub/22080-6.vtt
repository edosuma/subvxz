00:06.464 --> 00:09.676
[Jay grunting] Oh, yeah.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.928
Oh, yeah...

00:12.011 --> 00:14.305
[shouting] Abra-cum-dabra!

00:14.389 --> 00:16.307
Ha! Ta-da!
[chuckles]

00:16.391 --> 00:19.519
-Whoo! That was amazing.
-So good.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.062
Yeah. I really unloaded in you.

00:21.146 --> 00:24.190
-I love you, too.
-All right! [laughs]

00:24.274 --> 00:26.109
I'm gonna go wash my dick off
before school.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.986
Wait, Jay, can I talk to you
about something?

00:28.069 --> 00:32.365
Ugh. Okay, listen, for the last time
I am not gonna take you apple picking.

00:32.449 --> 00:36.161
No, it's not that.
I don't know how to say this, but...

00:36.244 --> 00:38.663
-I'm late.
-Late? You're a pillow.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.416
-You have nowhere to go.
-No, Jay. I'm pregnant.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.251
What?! [laughs]

00:43.334 --> 00:46.004
Nice. I mean, how would that
even be possible?

00:46.087 --> 00:48.882
Come on, don't be naive, Jay.
I told you to use protection.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.468
What? No, I thought
you meant from stains!

00:51.551 --> 00:54.304
-I'm not ready to have a baby!
-Well, you better get ready.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.306
Oh, man! Oh, man! This is--

00:56.389 --> 01:00.226
[mother] Boys, wash your dicks
and get ready for school!

01:00.310 --> 01:02.103
-[brother 1] Okay, Mom!
-[brother 2] Already on it, Ma!

01:02.187 --> 01:03.480
Shit, I'm late to wash my dick.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.056
[clarinet plays]

01:38.139 --> 01:40.517
[hits sour note]

01:41.810 --> 01:44.854
Wow, that was not good.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.357
My whole thing is like,
he's bad at clarinet.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.318
-True, but nobody else auditioned.
-He's wearing a hat.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.694
I also like his hat.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.571
He reminds me of a young Woody Allen

01:53.655 --> 01:55.782
playing a surprise gig
at the Carlyle Hotel.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.367
Woody Allen. Ho-ho.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.036
That guy is 85 pounds of pure sex.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.330
Woody Allen was accused of molestation.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.125
He says he didn't do it,
but he did marry his stepdaughter.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.752
It is both very complicated
and very simple.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.130
-I say we let Andrew in.
-God help us.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.257
Andrew, welcome to Jazz Club.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.051
And on a personal note,
I like your fedora.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.555
It evokes jazz's colorful past
and funky future.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.307
That was the exact vibe
I was trying to summon.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.561
Good banter. Now tell her you want
to wear her ass as a hat.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.272
-Really? Should I?
-No, no, don't do that.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.440
I'm off my game.
The Woody Allen stuff really threw me.

02:29.524 --> 02:33.361
That guy's a hero. Not artistically,
just personally speaking.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.279
[bell ringing]

02:34.362 --> 02:36.739
Remember that girl from camp
I told you about, Roland?

02:36.823 --> 02:40.160
Oh, yeah, Roland. I was picturing
an older man named Roland.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.537
Right. No, I didn't kiss
an older man at camp.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.165
-The heart wants what it wants.
-Anyway, she texted me last night.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.708
Quote, "Come into the city tomorrow.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.419
-We should hang out and whatevs."
-Ooh!

02:49.502 --> 02:52.088
-Do you know what "whatevs" means?
-Short for whatever.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.675
No, I think "whatevs" implies
that she wants to make out.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.552
Making out with a city girl. Wow.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.679
Andrew, we are going to New York.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.224
Me? Or, I'm sorry,
is there a fun person behind me?

03:03.308 --> 03:05.184
Like a dumb idiot, wears a fun shirt?

03:05.268 --> 03:06.978
No, you. You're fun.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.397
Oh, no, Nick. No, no, thank you,
but I am not fun.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.608
-I have many virtues. I'm loyal.
-Uh-huh.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.860
-I have a huge puffy winter coat--
-The biggest.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.237
But fun? No.
I think you should go by yourself.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.031
But I want to go with my best friend.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.450
And Andrew, I didn't want to play
the jazz card,

03:20.533 --> 03:21.701
but what about jazz?

03:21.784 --> 03:26.372
Andrew, jazz is about taking risks.
It's the only way you get better.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.124
-At jazz?
-At life!

03:28.207 --> 03:29.959
Jazz is like life.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.878
It goes on for longer than you think,

03:31.961 --> 03:35.006
and then as soon as you're like,
"I get it," it ends.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.341
-Oh.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.579
Excuse me, has anyone
thought about our parents?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.248
You know, they can track
our cell phones.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.958
That's why we're giving
our phones to Jessi.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.878
Hey, Jessi, what if you went with Nick
and I stayed safe and fine?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.256
I've got bat mitzvah stuff all afternoon.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.341
But I do think this is good for you,
Andrew.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.718
-I am so scared.
-Well, embrace it, girl.

-Get out of your comfort zone.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.764
Yeah, conquer your fears
and do what I want.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.224
How do we even get out of class?

04:26.307 --> 04:29.727
Well, these notes from your parents
were obviously forged...

04:29.811 --> 04:30.937
Oh, my God.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.106
...in the fires of good parenting.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.858
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Your folks understand the value

04:35.942 --> 04:38.027
of an unsupervised field trip
to Manhattan,

04:38.111 --> 04:41.406
which doesn't sound suspicious
to me at all.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.783
I feel guilty exploiting this man.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.786
I think he's really genuinely happy
to have any human contact.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.289
You know, I'll actually be
in the city myself later.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.166
Maybe we should... [blows]
I don't know, hang out. [blows]

04:52.250 --> 04:54.085
-You want to hang out with us?
-In Manhattan?

04:54.168 --> 04:56.504
No, no, deep Queens.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.589

-[laughs] That hat is hilarious!
-It's my jazz hat.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.445
Oh, boy, you're sincerely
wearing that hat.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.573
I bought it with the money
from when my grandfather died.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.702
-Oh, no. How much money?
-$199.

05:27.785 --> 05:32.206
Ah, yes, a fair price
for a marvelous hat. [groans]

-Yeah.

-Thanks for staying home.
-Of course, of course.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.800

what you wanna do?

05:42.884 --> 05:45.428
-About what?
-You know, like, pregnancy-wise.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.222
-Are you suggesting...?
-No, not at all.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.849
-Unless you wanna...
-I'm keeping it.

05:49.932 --> 05:53.478
Of course! I'm keeping it, too, 'cause
that's what we're doing, keeping it.

to have a baby.

-Why would you think that?!

-So, wait, how old are you?
-I'm 13.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.802
What?! You're too young to be a dad.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.555

want you to get rid of it!

-You know The Rock?

-Nick, I'm not getting on a helicopter.
-What do you mean?

09:35.950 --> 09:39.078
We came to the city for an adventure,
now we're gonna meet The Rock.

09:39.161 --> 09:43.749
Right, and as tempting as that is,
I can't fly.

-To Europe?
-To Clearwater, Florida.

between a dolphin and a poodle.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.774
-Andrew, you know him.
-I promise you I don't.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.611
-[trills]
-Oh, dear God in heaven.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.572
-Hi, boy.
-No, don't, my friend.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.992
Kevin eats fingers.
He thinks they're baby corn.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.202
-Who's Kevin?
-The dolphoodle.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.831
-You have amnesia, you know him.
-So, Nick, are you coming?

10:23.914 --> 10:26.751
I genuinely don't care,
but just make a decision.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.796
-Look, I'm not getting on that helicopter.
-[sighs]

10:30.880 --> 10:35.051
The kid I'm with can't fly.
Is there any way we can meet you there?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.638
Yeah, sure, whatever.
It's Dwayne's place, it's on the beach.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.223
Great. We'll see you there, no problem.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.144
[Mint] Andrew, remember
what I never told you,

10:45.227 --> 10:47.104
a scream can be music.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.981
I will, Mint.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.566
Oh, no, no, my hat!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.735
Oh, shit, no! Oh!

10:52.818 --> 10:57.448
[groans] It's gone. I'll never forget
the day I got that hat.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.533
That'll be $199.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.743
-[beeps]
-[Andrew] Um...

11:00.826 --> 11:02.578
It's a chip, man. You gotta stick it in.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.665
-Yeah, it's not working.
-Fuck. Let me see it.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
Oh, fuck me. James?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.878
Tanisha!

11:10.961 --> 11:13.506
-Nick, we have to find my hat.
-We have to go to Montauk.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.801
We're not going anywhere
until we find my hat.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.805
Fine, okay, we will find your jazz hat
and then we will go to Montauk.

11:20.888 --> 11:25.309
And at some point I actually am
going to need that Ezekiel bread.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.229
-Right, for your dandruff vitamin.
-Yeah, it's a twice daily.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.523
Babe! Babe, unlock the door!

11:30.606 --> 11:32.858
What's going on in there?
Are you okay?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.485
[panting]

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
Jay, I felt it kick.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.948
What? Who kicked you?
I'll kick his ass!

11:39.031 --> 11:41.200
-No, the baby. It's moving.
-What?

11:41.283 --> 11:44.620
So just to clarify, that means
the aborsh is completely off the tabes?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.330
-Yeah, Jay.
-Okay, good, yeah, yeah.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.708
'Cause technically you can do it
up until the baby's crowning.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
Stop quoting your dad's law commercials.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.504
Come here and feel it.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.964
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.216
Holy shit, babe, we created a life.

11:57.299 --> 12:01.220
-We did.
-This might be my greatest magic trick.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.597
-We did it together.
-It's like I'm the magician

12:03.681 --> 12:06.809
-and you're my trusted assistant.
-Maybe we're both the magician.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.938
Pam, will you make me
the happiest magician on Earth?

12:11.021 --> 12:11.981
Oh, Jay.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.400
-No.
-What?!

12:14.483 --> 12:18.279
I will throw myself down the stairs
and frame you for the murder!

12:18.362 --> 12:20.448
All right, it's clear what happened here.

12:20.531 --> 12:24.285
The pillow, in a fit of rage,
threw the sexy child magician

12:24.368 --> 12:26.120
down the stairs, he dies.

12:26.203 --> 12:29.206
She took him down. Goose down.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.126
Have you seen my sunglasses?

12:32.209 --> 12:34.086
Are these your sunglasses?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.130
Whoa! The kid's magic.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.467
Um, excuse me,
have you seen this hat?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.178
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen a lame jazz hat

12:42.261 --> 12:44.096
that's keeping me from my ultimate goal?

12:44.180 --> 12:49.018
Sweetie pie, have you tried
looking inside your own butthole?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.769
-Pardon me?
-[Duke's voice] Nick, it's me.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.313
-[Duke laughs]
-Duke?

12:53.772 --> 12:57.568
Did you know I've been inside
11 different people today?

12:57.651 --> 13:00.237
That ties my record
from when I was alive.

Oh.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.683
She saw us. We're gonna be
in oh so very much trouble.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.226
Let's all disappear.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.936
-Nick?
-Oh, my God.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.272
-Andrew?
-Just to be clear,

14:58.355 --> 15:00.733
we didn't see you kissing a lady
who's not your husband.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.068
This is obviously very awkward.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.695
-Is it?
-It is.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.948
-Look, I'm in the midst of something.
-Great.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.076
I met this person
who happens to be a woman.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.496
-No judgment.
-And I've really connected with her.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.707
-And truthfully Greg and I...
-Your husband.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.334
...haven't been happy
in a really long time.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.837
And, you know, he's checked out,
I'm trying to check in.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.049
-Does Jessi know?
-No, and... [sighs]

15:25.132 --> 15:27.551
-I don't want her to know yet.
-I see.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.179
But I also know I can't ask you to lie.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.432
So you need to do
what you think is right.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.186
Oh, honey, your poor tummy.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.604
I'm done. Wait--
[vomits]

15:38.687 --> 15:40.272
He speaks for both of us.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.942
Wait a sec, why aren't you two in school?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.777
-Why are you kissing a lady?
-Yeah.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.238
-Maybe I should just walk away.
-Maybe we will, too.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.990
Let's just be normal

15:50.074 --> 15:52.284
when we see you,
Seder second night.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.333
-Why won't you marry me?
-Honey, you're still a child.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.210
How would you even support us?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.420
I don't know.
I'll do whatever I have to do.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.839
We're in this together, Pam.
I fuckin' love you.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.468
I love you, too, Jayvid Blaine.
[giggles]

16:09.551 --> 16:11.553
-What'd you say?
-Jayvid Blaine.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.681
-Oh, yeah.
-Jay, put it in.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.641
Okay. Damn it.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.434
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. It's just--

16:17.518 --> 16:19.144
It hasn't happened to me before.
Hold on.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.563
I'm just gonna cram it in soft,
hope it gets hard inside.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.608
-You think I'm disgusting, don't you?
-What? No, no, no!

16:24.692 --> 16:26.527
-Of course not.
-I'm huge!

16:26.610 --> 16:30.072
-No, you look beautiful.
-I'm bursting at my seams, Jay!

16:30.155 --> 16:33.909
No, you look gorgeous,
are you kidding, babe?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.745
Honestly, I think I'm just
worried about, you know,

16:36.829 --> 16:38.163
hurting the baby with my huge dick.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.583
Don't worry about the baby.
The baby's fine. I want you inside me.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.961
-Yeah, say that again.
-I said I want you inside me.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.630
-Mm, yeah!
-Oh, now you're hard.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.966
I'm hard as like, ice.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.218
-Jay, put it in.
-Oh! I'm 40!

16:51.301 --> 16:54.763
-Yeah.
-My penis is next to the baby's head.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.390
I'm rich!

16:56.473 --> 16:57.725
That was crazy.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.060
Shannon is having an affair
with a woman.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.771
Poor Greg. God, poor Jessi.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.565
Kinda puts things into perspective, huh?

17:04.648 --> 17:06.942
Remember when your hat was important?
Not that it isn't.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.402
-The jazz hat is gone.
-Yeah.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.571
-So let's just go home.
-To Montauk.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.572
-What?
-What?

17:11.655 --> 17:14.158
-You can't be serious.
-Andrew, I looked for your hat,

17:14.241 --> 17:16.076
so now we go to Montauk.
That was the deal.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.663
Uh, no, I never explicitly agreed
to go to Montauk.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.249
-Oh, my God, you're such a weasel.
-Excuse me?

17:22.332 --> 17:25.169
Yeah, you're a scared weasel
with a bad ear,

17:25.252 --> 17:27.004
dandruff, and the worst hat in America.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.339
-What is with you and the hat?
-It's embarrassing!

17:29.423 --> 17:31.091
It's embarrassing or I'm embarrassing?

17:31.175 --> 17:34.720
-Forget it, just forget it.
-No, no, I want to hear it.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.348
-What do you want to hear?
-You think you're cool and I'm a loser.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.434
-Oh, please.
-Well, I've got news for you.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.144
-You needed me.
-Oh, really?

17:42.227 --> 17:45.355
Yeah, because you were too afraid
to go to the city alone.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.400
Am I out of my mind here?
We could be at The Rock's house,

17:48.484 --> 17:51.528
who you got a boner for,
which I never bring up

17:51.612 --> 17:54.740
-because I'm such a nice guy.
-Look, why don't you go to Montauk.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.326
I have 20 bucks,
I'm gonna take a cab home.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.327
Oh, sorry.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.413
Kid, you made me drop my cocaine.
You're gonna have to pay for that.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.667
Uh, well, I don't understand
what's happening but I apologize.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.088
You gotta pay me
for the cocaine you just spilled.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.173
Please tell me you're the ghost
of Duke Ellington.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.841
Duke who? Fuck you. Gimme that.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.427
-Oh, this is a mugging.
-No, you're being scammed.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.845
Mugging is more like...

18:16.929 --> 18:18.555
Gimme all your money, fucko!

18:18.639 --> 18:19.890
Here you go, sir.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.018
Sir, you forgot your cocaines.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.562
It's cocaine, Andrew, and it's not real.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.272
-[thunder cracks]
-Oh, man.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.027
[sighs] Sorry for farting.
[chuckles]

18:32.111 --> 18:33.695
I'm just so relaxed around you.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.031
No, I like the smell of your farts.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.616
-They turn me on.
-Cool.

18:37.699 --> 18:38.784
[groans]

18:38.867 --> 18:40.619
Ooh, what is this, a delayed orgasm?

18:40.702 --> 18:42.329
-[shouts out]
-Oh, yeah, baby, cum.

18:42.412 --> 18:46.208
No, Jay, it's a contraction.
I'm going into labor.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.960
Wait, wait, okay, where do we go,
the hospital?

18:48.043 --> 18:50.045
A seamstress? Bed Bath & Beyond?
I don't know.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.589
-There's no time, it's coming!
-What?! Already?

18:52.673 --> 18:55.509
How long is the gestation period
of a human-pillow hybrid?

18:55.592 --> 18:56.552
[screams]

18:56.635 --> 18:57.886
[thunder]

18:57.970 --> 19:00.639
This is so bad.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.267
-We have no idea where we are.
-It's getting so late.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.602
Our parents are probably
freaking out right now.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.646
I would've done
so many things differently.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.565
-I would've wiped better.
-What?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.191
It's not like I didn't wipe,

19:11.275 --> 19:14.361
but I should've wet the toilet paper
and just really gotten in there.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.737
You didn't wipe well?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.282
Roland had one of those stupid

19:18.365 --> 19:21.493
-and I didn't know how it flushed.
-Oh, my God, we really are children.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.538
That's what I've been telling you all day.
We're children.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.039
We'll figure it out, okay?

19:26.123 --> 19:30.043
-What are we gonna do?
-Why does that building have kneepads?

19:31.253 --> 19:34.047
[angelic choir sings]

19:35.674 --> 19:39.553
Um, excuse me, we're looking for Steve.
He's a regular.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.221
No, no Steve here.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.973
Hey, boys, over here. Over here.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.185
For some reason everyone here
calls me  pendejo.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.062
Oh, my God, Coach Steve,
you're a bartender?

19:49.146 --> 19:51.523
Oh, you flatter me. No, barback.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.027
My job is to get the egg smell
onto the water glasses.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.696
-Coach Steve, we lied to you.
-There's no field trip.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.240
-We were ditching school.
-And then we got robbed,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.075
and we have no idea how to get home.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.164
You looked me dead in the eye
and you lied to me?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.083
That's a very intimate act
between friends.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.419
-Can you help us get home?
-Please?

20:12.502 --> 20:14.671
You come to me, your mentor...

20:14.755 --> 20:16.924
-"Mentor" is a strong word.
-...in your hour of need

20:17.007 --> 20:19.885
and you think I'm gonna turn you away?
No chance.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.720
Patrick, set my boys up

20:21.803 --> 20:25.474
with some of your Jamaican Me Crazy
jerk chicken wings on the house.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.935
Pendejo,  man, you do not work here.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.853
One more time and I'm calling the cops.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.396
Oh, he'll do it. We should go.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.191
And stop rubbing those damn eggs
on the glasses.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.360
All right, Pat. I'll see you tomorrow.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.362
-I'll bring my own eggs.
-The hell you will.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.489
Oh, God! [shouts]

20:40.572 --> 20:43.075
Just breathe, babe, just breathe.
You're doing great.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.744
-I can't do this!
-Yes, you can. I'm right here.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.037
We're doing it together.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.456
-You and me?
-You and me, always you and me, Pam.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.211
Oh, my God.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.381
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.675
He looks just like you.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.345
Does he? He kinda looks like my brother.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.972
No, he doesn't look like Curt.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.848
Why would you say Curt?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.935
-Just...
-You lying bitch.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.563
-You fucked my brother?
-I thought we had an open relationship.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.898
What would give you that impression?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.693
We have an open relationship.
Oh, yeah.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.779
You can fuck anybody you want,
even my brothers.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.491
Okay, yeah, I might have sent
some mixed signals.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.785
Oh, Jay, Curt meant nothing to me.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.829
With him it was just sex.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.415
But with you, it's magic.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.626
[sighs] You say such good stuff
out of your mouth.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.420
I fucking love you so much.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.630
I don't care if it's not my baby,
I'm gonna raise him.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.841
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

21:40.924 --> 21:44.720
You're just so generous, and you have
the best body in your grade.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.096
-Come here. Yeah.
-Really?

21:46.179 --> 21:49.057
-In front of Scorpion?
-Is that his name?

21:49.141 --> 21:51.893
-I love it.
-Fuck yeah, it's his name and I love you.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.729
I love you. Mm.

I'm 41! Today's my birthday!

22:05.907 --> 22:09.119
Holy stromboli, you guys
had an adventure today, huh?

22:09.202 --> 22:13.332
It reminds me of that classic
The Doors song "Riders on the Storm".

22:13.415 --> 22:16.793
-You mind if I play it?
-Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead, Coach Steve.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.255
-Oh. Oh, okay.
-What a day.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.381
-God.
-I know.

Hey, I've been thinking,
and maybe we should tell Jessi

-I know.

But even more disappointed in myself,
and there's gonna be consequences.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.266
I'm taking away my credit card
and giving it to you. Here you go.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.602

in the city again.

-And you wanted to be the bad cop.
-Yeah, that was my bad cop.

23:19.815 --> 23:24.111
Honey, your punishment
is six weeks, no Netflix.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.278
-[Nick] Six weeks?
-Mm-hm.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.614
[sobs] You're gonna take away
Netflix, Mom?

What am I gonna do without Netflix?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.577
What were you thinking?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.955
You could have been lured
into an electronics store

23:35.038 --> 23:38.166
by a pushy Israeli and forced
to buy a camera you don't want.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.503
Worst of all, why would you go
to Patrick Ewing's Brewing Company?

23:41.586 --> 23:44.881
That bum! All he did was take
fadeaway jumpers and sweat profusely.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.217

[Pam]  My darling Jay,
by the time you read this I'll be gone.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.734
-What?!
- And I've taken Scorpion with me.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.279
You shouldn't have to raise a child
that isn't yours.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.905
Fucking bitch.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.741
And I bet you're calling me
a fucking bitch right now.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.244
That's so you, telling it like it is.

24:14.327 --> 24:15.662
I'll miss that.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.707
But most of all
I'll miss your great dick,

24:18.790 --> 24:20.959
your ripped abs, all of it.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.628
You're the whole package.
Plus you're rich?

24:23.712 --> 24:25.797
What am I doing? You're a king.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.008
No, no, I must go.

-Put a rubber on, junior.

-Hey, guys.
-All right, here she comes.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.949
-We're telling her.
-That her mom is cheating on her dad...

24:53.033 --> 24:56.328
-With a lesbian woman. Right.
-...who is not her father.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.747
So how was your big adventure
in New York City?

Anything crazy happen?

Oh, um... [clears throat]
Do you want to tell her, Andrew, or...?

25:03.793 --> 25:06.630
No, I think you're better at opening
your mouth and saying things.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.381
-Why don't you do the telling?
-Okay.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.717
Well... [clears throat]
Jessi...

25:10.800 --> 25:11.927
-What?
-Um...

-Jessi... [clears throat]
-Guys, what is it?

25:14.512 --> 25:15.805
-Well...
-We saw--

25:15.889 --> 25:19.434
There is someone out there
cross-breeding dolphins with poodles.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.894
-I'm not following.
-A dolphoodle!

25:20.977 --> 25:22.938
-Its name is Kevin.
-And he eats fingers...

-He thinks they're baby corn. Yes.
-They're baby corn.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.859
Eww. People are sick.
I'm glad I didn't go with you.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.903
Yeah, me too,

25:29.986 --> 25:33.531
'cause we saw some things
you wouldn't have wanted to see.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.700
All right, well,  hasta la vista.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.119
I blacked out. Did we tell her?

25:38.203 --> 25:41.706
-Jesus, Andrew, we blew it.
-I'm sorry, I couldn't do it.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.750
-What couldn't you do?
-Oh, nothing.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.961
-What's your problem?
-Whoo!

-No, I do not.
