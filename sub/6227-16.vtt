00:00.959 --> 00:02.336
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.669 --> 00:04.029
There's some writing
on this cloth.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.733
If it is writing, maybe
it tells us what that thing is.

00:06.757 --> 00:07.929
Nobody can know about this.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.911
Look. Rachel looks up at where
the shot was fired that killed Dixon.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.078
She works on
the campaign?

00:36.161 --> 00:37.879
Yeah, media relations.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.298
But watch this,

00:41.625 --> 00:43.878
she doesn't react quickly
enough to the gunshot.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.133
No way she could've
missed that.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.652
That's 'cause she
knew it was coming.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.757
How did you guys
put all this together?

00:48.966 --> 00:50.058
Eve.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.554
She was the one who found the
assassin and put him in the hospital.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.101
And the Captain
killed the assassin,

00:55.180 --> 00:57.899
which made him a hero, and
now he's running for mayor.

00:58.642 --> 01:03.068
You know, I got to say, I never
really completely trusted Renard.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.752
We're still not sure what the
Captain knew and when he knew it.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.946
I'm guessing he knows now.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.195
Eve believes
Rachel is Black Claw.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.199
Eve found campaign posters
for Renard in Rachel's house

01:13.282 --> 01:15.910
that were printed three days
before Dixon was shot.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.959
Well, then this conspiracy
theory ain't no theory.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.667
Eve knew the Captain was going to
announce his candidacy before he did.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.051
Then he's with Black Claw?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.754
Well, whatever side he's on,
I think we have to be careful

01:26.837 --> 01:28.339
with what we tell
him from now on.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.676
Yeah, no kidding! I mean, he already
knows a hell of a lot about us.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.930
All of us.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.346
The one advantage we have,
he doesn't know we know.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.563
So, what do we think?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.100
Are we voting for him?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.109
Well, the devil
you know...

01:42.394 --> 01:44.067
Phew!

01:46.273 --> 01:47.445
Hello?
Monroe?

01:47.524 --> 01:48.616
It's Ian Krieger.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.319
Hey, Ian, thanks
for calling me back.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.904
It's my professor friend.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.413
Oh, your friend you talked
to about the cloth.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.702
Sorry I couldn't get
back to you sooner.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.453
I've been buried in a Mesopotamian project.
You got something for me?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.957
I do. Yeah, hang on.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.335
So, I came across this
artifact, it's really old.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.670
It looks like some kind
of cloth-like material

02:07.753 --> 02:08.993
with some kind
of writing on it,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.390
but it's so faded we
can't make any of it out.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.600
I was hoping you might be
able to take a look at it.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.676
Where'd you find it?

02:15.427 --> 02:16.724
Where did I find it?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.346
Uncle Felix?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.558
Oh, um...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.235
I actually didn't find it,
it was given to me in...

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
Leipzig.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.816
My Uncle Felix had it at
his antiquarian book shop,

02:28.899 --> 02:34.201
and it came along with some other
ancient texts and the like,

02:34.404 --> 02:36.827
I inherited them
after he died.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.597
You think it's
something significant?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.831
I do, yeah.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.630
I mean, we might as well
take a look, right?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.383
I mean, you never know when you might
find the next Shroud of Turin.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.341
We could try
the image analyzer

02:46.416 --> 02:50.637
or an isometric projection, as
well as infrared thermography.

02:51.129 --> 02:55.760
Uh, best time to bring it by the
lab would be Thursday morning,

02:56.051 --> 02:57.098
10:00-ish.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.145
That's great. We'll be
there, thank you so much.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.438
Look, if anybody can figure
this cloth out, it's Krieger.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.681
Can we trust him with this?

03:05.769 --> 03:08.113
Well, whatever we tell him,
it's not going to be the truth.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.236
Somebody's in the shop.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.863
Eve.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.244
Rosalee.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.665
Everything okay?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.083
Some things are.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.291
Others are not.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.173
Do you remember when Adalind
became me and I became her?

03:26.456 --> 03:29.676
I'm pretty sure none of us will
ever be able to unremember that.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.303
You're thinking about
smoking that hat again?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.425
Yes.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.802
Oh, crap. You want to
become Adalind again?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.721
Jul... I mean, Eve,
don't you realize...

03:37.092 --> 03:38.810
Not Adalind.
Then who?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.350
Sean Renard.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.312
What? I'm sorry, is
that even possible?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.691
I mean, you're so...

03:45.934 --> 03:47.151
Like, not as tall.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.821
Not to mention he's
got other anatomical...

03:50.021 --> 03:51.022
It hurts.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.323
You've already done it?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.409
I had to make sure
it would work.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.569
Why?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.322
We need to know
what he knows.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.331
The best way to do that
is for me to be him

04:00.407 --> 04:02.626
so that I can ask
the people who do know.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.578
But to do that, I'm
going to need to know

04:04.661 --> 04:06.880
where he is so that I
can be where he isn't.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.586
Oh, that makes sense.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.468
I mean, face-to-face would
probably be not so good.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.302
I'll need your
help with this.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.255
If we can, we'll help.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.927
I'll call you
when I'm ready.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.815
Whoa! That is definitely
not Juliette.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.693
Not the good one
or the bad one.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.190
I mean, my God,
just thinking about

04:29.269 --> 04:30.942
her little body
turning into Renard's...

04:32.022 --> 04:33.865
I'm gonna have to get
that out of my head.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.527
Yeah. Good luck with that.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.621
He took my sins away

04:39.696 --> 04:42.540
Let's say it again I'm
so glad I'm so glad

04:42.616 --> 04:44.368
He took my sins away

04:44.451 --> 04:46.499
I'm so glad

04:46.578 --> 04:48.455
He took my sins away

04:48.538 --> 04:50.632
I'm so glad

04:50.707 --> 04:56.180
He took my sins away
He took my sins away

05:03.428 --> 05:04.771
Thank you, sisters.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.064
Do you feel the love?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.399
Yes!

05:08.892 --> 05:10.235
Do you feel it
in your hearts?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.524
Yes!

05:11.603 --> 05:13.071
Do you feel it
in your souls?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.780
Yes!

05:14.856 --> 05:16.733
Well, I don't!
CROWD; Oh!

05:17.025 --> 05:18.151
Not yet.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.704
I see a lot of
good here tonight.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.576
But I know that there's
also evil here with us.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.419
Evil that can't be seen.

05:29.079 --> 05:33.255
Because I know that wherever
we go, Satan follows.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.918
- That's right.
- Yeah.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.589
And he is here
with us right now.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
No!

05:39.840 --> 05:40.932
Yep.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.683
He's here right now.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.760
No!

05:44.135 --> 05:45.808
And make no mistake about it,

05:45.971 --> 05:49.396
what he wants is
your immortal soul.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.101
- No!
- He does.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.566
Satan, come on out!
You can't hide!

05:57.399 --> 05:59.822
Come on! Come into me,
I'm not afraid!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.662
You leave
these souls alone.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.700
Their sins,
whatever they were,

06:06.783 --> 06:08.126
are now mine!

06:08.535 --> 06:13.211
Satan, you come
into me right now!

06:13.790 --> 06:17.169
Satan, I command you
to come out of them

06:17.836 --> 06:19.679
and come into me!

06:20.589 --> 06:24.594
Their sins are now my sins!

06:47.991 --> 06:48.992
What the...

07:23.693 --> 07:24.865
Out!

07:27.030 --> 07:28.498
Out with you, Satan!

07:48.718 --> 07:51.392
The evil has
been defeated.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.562
And our sins
have gone with him.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.480
Can you feel
the weight lifted?

07:59.854 --> 08:00.901
Yes!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.490
Were you just
shooting photos?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.863
Can you feel peace
entering your hearts?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.528
Yes!
It's very important...

08:06.611 --> 08:08.705
Hey! There's no shooting
pictures inside.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.902
I wasn't shooting pictures.

08:09.906 --> 08:10.907
Let me see your phone.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.368
Yeah, right.
Get a warrant.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.076
Give me your phone!

08:14.119 --> 08:15.166
All right,
take it easy!

08:15.912 --> 08:17.129
You want to
see my phone?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.540
I'll give you my phone.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.257
I'm so glad He
took my sins away

08:23.336 --> 08:25.179
I'm so glad
I'm so glad

08:25.255 --> 08:27.383
He took my sins away

08:27.465 --> 08:29.513
I'm so glad

08:29.592 --> 08:32.220
He took my sins away...

08:32.470 --> 08:33.596
Hey, Luke!

08:34.764 --> 08:35.765
Luke!

08:38.768 --> 08:39.815
Get him!

08:54.159 --> 08:55.285
Is he okay?

08:55.618 --> 08:56.665
No.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.164
He's dead.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.380
I'm so glad
I'm so glad

09:02.500 --> 09:04.719
He took away

09:05.003 --> 09:09.053
He took my sins away

09:16.431 --> 09:17.978
What is this,
some kind of circus?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.481
I think that depends
on what you believe.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.986
Is this a tent revival?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.238
Dwight Eleazer presiding.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.321
Apparently there was
a meeting earlier tonight.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.735
Somebody was
caught taking pictures

09:27.817 --> 09:29.069
inside the tent,
which is prohibited.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.076
There was an altercation
outside and the victim,

09:32.155 --> 09:35.250
one of the guards employed by
the Eleazer Foundation, died.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.955
Cracked his skull
on a rock.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.545
Who hit who first
is unknown.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.837
Any witnesses?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.415
A couple of the other guards
saw the end of the fight.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.500
That is them.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.085
One ran after
the assailant,

09:45.168 --> 09:48.172
who got into a waiting car which
apparently sped away real fast.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.390
But out of state,
maybe Arizona,

09:50.465 --> 09:52.092
and a possible
make on the car.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.552
Well, let's get a BOLO.
Yeah.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.933
What do you
know about him?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.685
Luke Virkler.
Age 39.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.565
Home address is
St. Louis, Missouri.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.044
Employed as part
of the preacher's

10:01.101 --> 10:03.195
security team for
the last three years.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.900
Does Luke
know his killer?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.982
Not according
to Mark and John.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.368
Mark, Luke
and John, really?

10:10.735 --> 10:13.579
I'm just the messenger.
And not from on high.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.369
Well, I think we
should figure out why

10:15.448 --> 10:17.048
they don't want anybody
to take pictures.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.453
Well, you can find the head
honcho under the big top.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.632
Uh, we're looking
for Dwight Eleazer.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.384
You're going to
get this guy, right?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.549
He killed Luke.
We saw it.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.054
We'll do what we can.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.474
...the courage to
change the things I can

10:37.554 --> 10:39.648
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.894
Sir, the detectives are here.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.896
Thank you all for
your time here.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.188
Our apologies
for interrupting.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.354
I'm Detective Griffin,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.533
Well, I'm devastated
by what happened.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.531
Luke was a fine man.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.738
But evil is always with us.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.535
There's no avoiding it.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.492
I don't have to
tell you two.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.301
There was an altercation
because someone

11:00.326 --> 11:01.953
was taking photographs
of your service?

11:02.245 --> 11:04.213
Yeah. We don't allow that.
Well, why not?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.264
You don't know anything
about me, do you?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.088
I can't say that we do.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.050
Well then, I don't expect
you to understand.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.556
That's why we're here,
for a little understanding.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.516
I'll try, but you
won't believe me.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.350
There can be
no good without evil.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.275
But evil must
first be confronted

11:24.851 --> 11:26.444
before it can
be driven out.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.407
What I do is
take the evil

11:30.607 --> 11:32.780
from those who come
seeking salvation.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.486
Where do you take it?

11:34.777 --> 11:35.994
Into my body.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.244
I let myself be
possessed by Satan.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.452
And then I cast him
out with my faith.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.039
And you don't let people
take pictures of that why?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.799
What I do is dangerous.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.051
It's not a show,
some performance

11:50.126 --> 11:51.969
to be cheapened
on the Internet.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.922
People would just
assume it's a trick.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.928
You think the devil
literally possesses you?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.850
You come and watch.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.641
And then you tell
me Satan isn't real.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.480
So why all
the bodyguards?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.895
People see what happens
to me, they get scared.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.191
Sometimes they attack.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.899
Look, I don't blame them.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.482
The devil's a frightening
beast to confront.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.254
And how long will
you be in Portland?

12:13.650 --> 12:14.902
Two days.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.570
Then we move on.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.947
Luke's death hangs
heavy on my conscience,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.662
he died trying
to protect us.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.206
We'll let you know
if we find anything.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.795
Thank you.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.764
"If you have hope
and faith in Him,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.140
"you shall be delivered
from your enemies.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.269
"Fear nothing
but the devil's treachery."

12:45.515 --> 12:47.313
I have the proof.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.352
Show us.
You were right.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.716
He is the devil and he's stealing
money from the faithful.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.527
He must be
put to death.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.029
Not if
we can help it.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.569
The devil
is inside him.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.997
Then the devil
must be driven out,

13:01.072 --> 13:02.915
for we are his only salvation.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.958
Pretty interesting. All
of Dwight Eleazer's guards

13:12.041 --> 13:13.418
have had issues
with the law.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.471
Car theft, vandalism,
assault, disorderly conduct.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.139
Some did a little time.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.808
But all that seemed to stop when
they started working for him.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.557
Well, maybe they found a little
salvation working for Dwight.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.976
Second chances
inspire loyalty.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.183
I pulled up some
newspaper articles.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.778
Seems like during
Dwight's tent revivals,

13:31.853 --> 13:34.072
he actually gets
possessed by the devil.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.861
This happens a lot?
Apparently.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.825
Eyewitnesses are
quoted as saying

13:37.900 --> 13:39.527
they've seen Dwight
possessed by Satan,

13:39.610 --> 13:40.702
and then casting him out.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.785
But the devil gets thrown
out again and again

13:42.864 --> 13:44.064
and keeps coming
back for more?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.827
It does make you wonder
about Satan's schedule.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.295
If Satan has really
teamed up with Dwight,

13:49.370 --> 13:51.210
I think the devil should
be getting top billing

13:51.247 --> 13:52.840
and he's not even
on the poster.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.168
Oh, this is definitely
something we want to see.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.133
Next show's tomorrow.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.598
Devil, here we come.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.509
Welcome to Portland Tonight.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.936
And welcome to our
two mayoral candidates,

14:05.011 --> 14:07.264
Steven Gallagher
and Sean Renard.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.605
Hello, Brenda,
good to be here.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.881
Thank you for
this opportunity.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.403
The polls show you two in a
dead heat at the moment.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.360
And it's been suggested
that Sean Renard,

14:16.439 --> 14:19.113
having taken Andrew Dixon's
place as the candidate,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.202
is counting on
a sympathy vote.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.450
We're all sympathetic to
the tragic circumstances

14:23.529 --> 14:25.623
that lead to Mr. Renard
becoming the candidate.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.955
But Mr. Renard is
no Andrew Dixon.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.869
In fact, Mr. Renard
has virtually

14:29.952 --> 14:31.625
no political
experience at all.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.706
Well, considering the current
state of city government,

14:33.790 --> 14:36.543
I believe that this city
needs new leadership,

14:36.626 --> 14:38.469
a new direction,
and a new outlook.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.888
Let me ask you both
about gun violence.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.091
Because people in
this city are scared

14:43.174 --> 14:44.847
about the proliferation
of guns,

14:44.926 --> 14:46.724
but they're divided
over gun control.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.980
So where do each of you stand
on this polarizing issue?

14:50.473 --> 14:52.350
Well, I don't carry
a gun on a daily basis.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.148
I've never shot anyone,
unlike my opponent,

14:55.520 --> 14:58.023
and since I don't own a gun,
I don't see how I ever could.

14:58.189 --> 15:02.239
My opponent obviously has much more
experience with deadly weapons.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.409
Now, I'm not saying that we need
to take away anyone's guns,

15:05.488 --> 15:07.786
but we do need
tougher regulation.

15:07.865 --> 15:08.957
Look, Brenda,
the answer is simple.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.580
We need to keep
guns out of the hands

15:10.660 --> 15:13.413
of those who would use them to
harm and kill innocent people.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.498
What is this?
Sort of a debate.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.792
I still can't believe
he's running for mayor.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.799
You were armed when he was shot,
and what good did that do?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.305
Look, this is
not an inquiry...

15:23.381 --> 15:25.008
I'm not sure he'd
make a good mayor.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.844
You know, considering
everything I know about him.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.596
Yeah, that, and
he's a Zauberbiest.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.273
Not really known
for their altruism.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.934
Not really.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.403
Have you told
him where we live?

15:37.687 --> 15:38.734
No.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.024
So you don't
trust him either.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.984
Not always.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.701
And I'd like to know
why he's doing this.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.323
More power.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.289
Zauberbiests and Hexenbiests
find it very appealing.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.296
Well, you don't need to
be a witch to want power.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.922
Probably not.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.465
Can I ask you
a question about Diana?

16:01.878 --> 16:03.221
Of course.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.640
You said you saw her get onto
the helicopter with Juliette,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.717
but Juliette wasn't
actually on the helicopter.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.552
Well, I made an assumption,
and I was wrong.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.387
So maybe Diana
wasn't on it either.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.163
Is there anything you could do
to help find out where she is?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.063
I can try, but it's
not gonna be easy.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.232
Did Sean ever say
anything about her?

16:22.398 --> 16:23.399
Not to me.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.952
What?

16:28.070 --> 16:32.746
It just seems like no matter how
badly we want something to work,

16:32.825 --> 16:35.078
too many things we can't
control are in the way.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.928
I'll find out
what I can.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.435
How bad was I?

16:51.928 --> 16:54.272
For a first debate,
not so bad.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.440
We got our feet wet.
And we didn't drown.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.518
I tell you, the whole
time I was up there,

16:58.601 --> 17:00.228
I kept thinking I was
in the wrong place.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.401
You're wrong.
You're going to win.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.615
Gallagher scored
a few points,

17:04.690 --> 17:07.193
but now we know how he's
going to come after you.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.782
And next time, we know
how to go after him.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.209
I was too nice.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.957
You're at it early.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.623
Adalind wanted me to find out
whatever I can about Diana.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.702
She doesn't have any birth
certificate that I know of.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.428
No social security number.
No paper trail.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.721
It's like she
doesn't exist.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.318
If you're not in
a database somewhere,

17:29.382 --> 17:30.634
you probably don't exist.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.347
Hey, got a hit on
the suspect's car.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.054
Registered to a Benjamin
McCullough of Arizona.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.937
Parked in front of a small
theater in Alberta.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.312
It has to be tonight.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.395
There's only one more service.
They're leaving tomorrow.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.730
We're not ready.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.323
We will be.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.320
Make the contact tonight.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.163
I can try, but I'm not
sure if he'll do it.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.741
It won't be easy
for him.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.213
Don't give him a choice.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.517
Benjamin McCullough?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.353
What the hell?
Are you Benjamin McCullough?

18:23.436 --> 18:24.437
Yes.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.692
We need to see
some identification.

18:25.813 --> 18:26.860
What are you doing?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.067
Stay back,
do not interfere.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.193
It's him.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.950
Any weapons you want to tell
me about before I search you?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.281
I don't like surprises.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.785
I don't have any weapons.
I haven't done anything.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.412
Turn around. Place your hands
on the trunk of the car.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.080
I want to know what
you think he did!

18:39.785 --> 18:40.832
Cell phone.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.757
Sack of
something heavy.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.380
It's coins. That belongs to her.
It's her money.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.991
It's not mine,
you can't take it.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.097
Well, we've yet to
make that determination.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.390
It's ours! We need it.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.013
This is a murder
investigation.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.263
Unless you want to get arrested,
too, I suggest you stay out of it.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.872
Murder? What are
you talking about?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.436
These the car keys?
Yes.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.810
All right,
let's take him in.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.608
I don't know what they're talking about.
Let's go.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.064
Impound the car.
Nobody touches it.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.652
That money belongs to God.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.698
Then all He or She
has to do is prove it.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.421
That's him.
What number?

19:23.579 --> 19:24.751
Number five.
You're sure?

19:24.872 --> 19:25.919
Positive.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.420
- He's one of them.
- One of who?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.426
People like him
trying to destroy Dwight.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.096
Dwight's saving
lives from darkness.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.053
What do you mean
trying to destroy Dwight?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.092
Dwight gets death
threats wherever we go.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.804
Some people fear him,
think he is the devil.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.555
He's not.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.599
He's a prophet.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.440
It's not right.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.281
Luke shouldn't
have died from this.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.493
McCullough was
born in Tempe, Arizona.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.987
Still carrying an Arizona
license, address in Flagstaff.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.287
Been arrested six times.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.416
Got a couple of GTA
arrests in his late teens.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.539
Most recently,
couple of robberies,

20:02.618 --> 20:04.211
then nothing over
the last three years.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.997
Maybe that's when
he got religion.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
I'm all for it if it stops
him from doing bad.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.296
You got anything
on the woman?

20:10.501 --> 20:13.505
Joan Vark, from
Lockhart, Texas.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.759
Has a troubled past, too.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.472
Shoplifting, couple of assaults,
drunk and disorderly,

20:18.676 --> 20:22.522
B and E, but that seems to have
died down about seven years ago.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.044
Driver's license is from Oregon,
address in the Southeast.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.142
Ow!

20:26.225 --> 20:27.226
You all right?

20:27.309 --> 20:30.279
Yeah, just a muscle strain or something.
I'll be fine.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.778
Let's talk to McCullough.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.656
I didn't know he died. How
was I supposed to know that?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.830
He tried to take my cell
phone, he attacked me.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.451
You see this? This is where he hit me.
I was just trying to leave.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.738
What I did was
self-defense.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.041
Why were you taking pictures
of Dwight's service?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.130
He's possessed
by Satan.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.050
You have my cell phone. Just look
at it if you don't believe me.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.047
Dwight Eleazer is tricking people
and he's stealing their money,

20:55.129 --> 20:57.382
in the name of God.
That's the devil's work.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.161
What were you planning on doing
with the pictures you took?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.680
The world needs to see the
danger he is to all of us.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.101
And what about
the gold coins?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.813
Those are worth
more than $12,000.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.024
They belong to the church.
I was taking them to the bank.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.154
You need to
give those back.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.509
What church are
we talking about?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.741
The Church of
the Word of God.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.485
And the woman who came out
and tried to stop us,

21:17.568 --> 21:18.945
she's part of
that church, too?

21:19.028 --> 21:20.325
Yeah, it's hers.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.323
She's a true prophet.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.704
Dwight Eleazer is
a disciple of the devil.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.869
So I don't know what
you're gonna arrest me for.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.392
I hit that bodyguard
in self-defense.

21:28.496 --> 21:32.501
And I'm sorry that he died,
but he chose the wrong path.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.052
If I saw this in person, I'd
believe I was seeing the devil.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.132
Me, too.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.809
Well, let's hope
he's Wesen instead.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.603
Wu, why don't you look a little deeper
into the Church of the Word of God

21:44.678 --> 21:45.725
and see what
you can find.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.057
Roger that.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.435
That's a hell of a
show, but it ain't the devil.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.106
That's a Woge, right?

21:52.228 --> 21:53.650
Oh, yeah,
definitely.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.068
A Furis Rubian.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.667
They've been mistaken for the devil
since the beginning of time.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.280
And what's not so
common knowledge is

21:59.360 --> 22:00.840
the Pope actually
had a couple of them

22:00.903 --> 22:04.373
chained up in the basement of St.
Peter's Basilica in the Dark Ages,

22:04.573 --> 22:05.665
which they would
trot out through

22:05.741 --> 22:06.742
the countryside
every now and then

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
to put the fear of
hell into the populace.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.376
Alms went way up.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.418
Ironically, Furis Rubians?
Not really that violent.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.261
Their look is far
worse than their bite.

22:17.628 --> 22:21.758
But this guy, he's
obviously Woging to, like,

22:21.841 --> 22:25.220
convince people he's dealing with
the devil on a first-person basis.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.504
Dwight's doing it
again today.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.555
We're going.

22:27.888 --> 22:28.889
I think we should
go with you.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.190
Oh, yeah,
this I got to see.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.033
Holy matrimony.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.636
Argh! Damn it.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.810
That's not right.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.186
Wow.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.981
This guy is
really good.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.612
Yeah, this Furis
Rubian is killing it.

23:21.692 --> 23:25.071
I command you,
leave this flesh and blood

23:25.362 --> 23:28.741
and return to hell
where you belong!

23:30.618 --> 23:32.738
If I didn't know what I know,
I'd be on my knees, too.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.970
I'm so glad
He took my sins away

23:46.050 --> 23:48.929
I'm so glad He
took my sins away

23:49.011 --> 23:50.388
I'm so glad

23:50.471 --> 23:51.973
I don't know.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.268
Kind of looks like he might actually
be doing more good than harm.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.444
My sins away

23:57.519 --> 23:59.362
Let's say it again,
I'm so glad

23:59.480 --> 24:00.481
I'm so glad

24:00.564 --> 24:02.566
He took my sins away

24:02.691 --> 24:04.409
I'm so glad

24:04.568 --> 24:06.696
He took my sins away

24:06.779 --> 24:08.031
I'm so glad

24:08.113 --> 24:10.832
I'm so glad
He took my sins away

24:15.329 --> 24:16.376
You got the money?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.291
No. You'll get it after.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.376
No, that wasn't the deal.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.295
I want it now. Right now.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.347
The only way to save
Dwight is through us.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.091
And what if
it goes wrong?

24:28.258 --> 24:29.475
He'll know I betrayed him.

24:30.594 --> 24:35.441
If you don't help us, the
devil will take him forever.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.646
Then get
me the money.

24:40.729 --> 24:41.946
Or it's on you.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.331
So, do you think the people who
work for Dwight know he's Wesen,

24:51.407 --> 24:54.001
or do they actually think he's
possessed by the devil, too?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.829
The bodyguards we interrogated
said that he was a prophet.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.334
I think
they're believers.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.676
If Dwight gave instructions to harm
anyone caught taking photographs,

25:01.750 --> 25:03.468
then he'd be culpable
for what happened.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.351
I think you're going
have to have a little

25:05.379 --> 25:07.381
"Come to Grimm"
talk with this guy.

25:07.756 --> 25:11.135
Well, I'll talk to Mark first, see
what Dwight's instructions were.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.594
Thanks for the help.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.930
Yeah. Anything else,
just let us know.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.607
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
Lord, have mercy.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.269
Mark.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.689
We saw Dwight.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.573
You believe me now?

25:24.815 --> 25:25.987
We do.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.867
So what does
Dwight have you do

25:27.943 --> 25:29.445
if you catch somebody
taking photos?

25:29.820 --> 25:30.912
We stop them.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.288
What if they don't
want to be stopped?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.786
No, no. That's
not an option.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.509
Was that what
happened last night?

25:35.534 --> 25:36.911
Luke tried to
stop McCullough?

25:37.453 --> 25:38.625
Look, I didn't see
what happened,

25:38.704 --> 25:40.047
I only saw what
he did to Luke.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.961
What happened to Luke
could've been self-defense.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.293
We need to
talk to Dwight.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.839
Sir?

25:45.377 --> 25:46.799
You came and saw.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.304
We did.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.842
We need to talk
to you about that.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.685
Well, as you can see, I
have nothing up my sleeve.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.327
We still have a few questions
about what happened last night.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.038
We'd like to talk
to you in private.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.816
Sure.
Sir?

26:00.100 --> 26:02.979
No, it's all right. I've nothing
to hide from the police.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.571
Did they arrest
that guy?

26:12.905 --> 26:14.705
I don't know. You pointed
him out, didn't you?

26:15.532 --> 26:16.579
Yeah.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.626
He killed Luke. Why
didn't they arrest him?

26:18.702 --> 26:19.794
I don't know.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.873
They better not
let him go.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.336
I'll kill him myself.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.133
Would you shut up?
Just shut up.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.007
Go help start
with the take-down.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.550
Must be pretty tiring
what you go through.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.010
Yeah. It takes
a lot out of you.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.846
You seem to have a pretty
intimate relationship with Satan.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.563
Don't be facetious.

26:38.764 --> 26:42.064
I'm not. But you do seem to
have him at your beck and call.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.319
Does make you wonder
who's calling all the shots.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.438
What is it you want?

26:46.647 --> 26:51.027
What possesses a Furis
Rubian to become a preacher?

26:51.902 --> 26:54.371
Is it just to save souls,
or is it about the money?

26:54.988 --> 26:57.332
I don't know what you're talking
about, and I think I'm...

26:57.407 --> 26:58.954
You do know what
I'm talking about.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.921
Unless you haven't heard
of a Decapitare, or a Grimm.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.801
Yeah. I've heard
of a Decapitare,

27:17.219 --> 27:18.721
but I never
thought I'd meet one.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.938
You're supposed to cut
my head off, aren't you?

27:23.225 --> 27:25.478
Do the people that work for
you know that you're Wesen?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.108
No.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.899
So, it's just a show.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.661
I have a gift, and I
use it to help people.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.706
They come to me
beaten down, broken,

27:38.031 --> 27:40.250
full of guilt for the
things they've done wrong.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.168
And I take that
guilt from them.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.168
Am I really possessed
by the devil? No.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.925
But do I relieve them
from their suffering?

27:48.458 --> 27:49.459
Yes, I do.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.071
You've ordered
your people to stop

27:51.086 --> 27:53.009
anyone from taking
photos of what you do.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.674
Yeah. If anyone were
to see it on a screen,

27:54.756 --> 27:56.053
they'd think
what I do is fake.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.602
How far does your order go? Does
it include physical violence?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.262
No, I don't
condone violence.

28:02.806 --> 28:06.606
My bodyguards have had
more difficult lives.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.443
If someone gets physical
with them, they respond.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.196
I don't think you can
arrest me for what I do,

28:13.275 --> 28:16.199
unless you plan to arrest every
minister, priest, or rabbi.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.448
As far as I know, dealing
hope is not illegal, so...

28:21.074 --> 28:24.294
One of your people was killed
last night because of your order.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.538
I saved him from
a life of sin.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.882
Just like the others
who work with me.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.216
Even if I were to tell them I was
Wesen, they'd think it was a lie.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.506
They don't need me to tell
them the devil is real,

28:35.589 --> 28:37.057
they've lived with him.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.563
So if you're gonna kill
me, go ahead and do it.

28:43.764 --> 28:44.890
Get it over with.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.476
I won't stop you.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.485
I accept my fate.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.197
Otherwise,
get out of my trailer.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.200
'Cause I have souls to save
in Salem tomorrow night.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.785
Thank you
for your time.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.246
Wait, that's it?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.834
We try not to judge.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.297
There's no way we can charge
McCullough with anything.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.882
And without motives
or witnesses,

29:17.965 --> 29:19.387
we got nothing
but self-defense.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.934
And Dwight's
got a point.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.480
Who are we to tell somebody what
they can and can't believe in?

29:25.013 --> 29:27.186
Maybe he is doing
more good than harm.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.526
Except for the guy
who died.

29:30.727 --> 29:34.027
Well, none of us
get out of here alive.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.616
Who is it?

30:26.867 --> 30:27.914
It's Mark, sir.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.586
Come on in.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.630
Yes, Mark,
what do you want?

30:40.964 --> 30:42.432
I've come to ask
your forgiveness.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.218
Well, for what?

30:46.094 --> 30:47.641
What I have to
do to save you.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.484
I shouldn't
have done this.

30:56.938 --> 30:57.985
No.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.198
I shouldn't
have helped you.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.403
Calm down, you did the right thing.
You'll get your money.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.541
Oh God, what have I done?

31:12.871 --> 31:13.963
What have I done?

31:15.665 --> 31:17.713
If McCullough and Joan's
Church of the Word of God

31:17.793 --> 31:19.420
don't know that
Dwight is Wesen,

31:19.503 --> 31:22.552
and they really believe he
was possessed by the devil,

31:22.631 --> 31:24.383
wouldn't they be trying
to kill the devil?

31:24.466 --> 31:27.811
And who carries around
$12,000 worth of gold coins?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.222
That's not money you take
to the market for food.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.439
That's blood money.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.395
So, what do we do
with McCullough?

31:33.558 --> 31:35.598
Let's assume they're going
to make a move on Dwight.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.854
I say we give McCullough back his cell
phone and his money, turn him loose.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.905
Yeah, let's follow the money. It always
goes somewhere bad.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.319
It might be Eve.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.362
Burkhardt.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.372
Do you know
where Renard is?

31:48.198 --> 31:49.199
Eve?

31:49.282 --> 31:50.955
Yes. Is he there?

31:51.201 --> 31:52.623
Uh, yeah.
I'm looking at him.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.001
Keep him busy for
a couple of hours.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.665
I'll let you know
what I find out.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.379
That her?

32:02.462 --> 32:04.339
Sort of.
Oh.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.387
Glad you guys got back.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.476
I have a little
tidbit of information.

32:08.552 --> 32:09.599
Took me a while
to corroborate,

32:09.678 --> 32:12.181
but you might
find it interesting.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.228
Dwight Eleazer was married
to Joan Vark seven years ago.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.900
It lasted a
not-so-holy-matrimonious 15 months.

32:23.525 --> 32:24.572
Who dumped whom?

32:25.277 --> 32:28.451
According to the article, he had
affairs with a couple parishioners.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.828
Joan said, I think I'm
quoting her correctly,

32:30.907 --> 32:32.079
"The devil made him do it."

32:33.326 --> 32:34.828
Let's pull the Captain in
on this one.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.212
It'll keep him busy.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.877
Twelve gold coins,
the devil, possession...

32:41.334 --> 32:42.426
This sounds medieval.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.925
And Dwight's Wesen,
a Furis Rubian.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.047
Never seen one.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.428
They look like the devil.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.990
There's not enough evidence
to take McCullough to trial.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.846
But the woman who's running
the church he's involved with

32:52.929 --> 32:54.306
used to be married
to Dwight.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.565
It didn't end well.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.018
We think she truly believes
he's possessed by the devil.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.690
So she doesn't
know he's Wesen.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.192
Probably not.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.318
How do you want
to handle this?

33:02.397 --> 33:04.437
We want to turn McCullough
loose with his gold coins

33:04.441 --> 33:05.693
and see what
the money's for.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.491
And because this is Wesen,
we could use your help.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.116
Well, let's turn him loose,
see where he takes us.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.341
Glad you could come over.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.756
Glad you called.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.516
There are a few things
we need to discuss.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.602
There always is.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.347
We can talk after.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.063
After what?

33:39.559 --> 33:41.402
Very funny.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.952
It's been
a brutal day.

33:49.819 --> 33:50.866
I really need this.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.168
I know
you're in there, Devil.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.131
I know you can hear me.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.472
Joan?
Don't try to trick me.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.050
It won't work.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.891
What are you doing?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.011
Saving you.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.810
No, Joan, please!

34:18.181 --> 34:19.228
You don't know
what you're doing!

34:19.306 --> 34:20.728
Don't listen to
a word he says.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.643
It's the devil's
words. Silence him.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.859
No! The devil
is not in me!

34:24.938 --> 34:25.938
No!

34:26.313 --> 34:27.406
Joan!

34:27.524 --> 34:28.650
Joan!

34:28.900 --> 34:29.992
No!

34:48.085 --> 34:49.884
Yeah, he's heading
for the tent.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.719
Maybe this is where
he's delivering the money.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.927
Why is he delivering money to
Dwight from his ex-wife's church?

34:55.010 --> 34:57.854
Ex-wives don't usually
give money to ex-husbands.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.524
And what's he doing?

35:01.891 --> 35:03.518
Maybe the money
is not for Dwight.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.358
Something's wrong.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.076
Let's check it out.

35:45.393 --> 35:49.569
Um, if I win, I need to know
what they expect of me.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.491
When you win.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.493
Yes, when.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.449
But who's in charge?

35:55.570 --> 35:57.072
I want to know
who's behind all this.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.492
Hey, you getting a little
nervous all of a sudden?

36:01.576 --> 36:04.170
No, I just don't
want any surprises.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.920
Well, a few surprises
can be fun.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.259
You seem a little
tense tonight.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.520
No, I just have
many questions in...

36:22.305 --> 36:23.932
In my mind.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.481
Well, we'll get around
to those in a little while.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.320
Now we drive
the devil back to hell.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.505
We know you are
possessed of evil.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.258
We know, Dwight, you have
no control over this.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.296
We are here to help you
repel the beast inside you.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.927
He's dead.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.758
Who?
Mark.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.139
We gave him the money.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.471
Yes, but the devil
had already taken him.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.063
He made Mark do it!

37:04.305 --> 37:05.648
He made him hang himself!

37:06.015 --> 37:07.392
Get the devil out!

37:15.692 --> 37:19.037
In the name of God, Satan,
I command you, release him!

37:19.696 --> 37:21.118
Leave him, Satan!

37:31.916 --> 37:33.589
- Look out!
- No, no, no!

37:34.252 --> 37:35.629
Oh, my God!

37:38.173 --> 37:39.846
lam not afraid!

37:40.008 --> 37:41.851
You took my husband from me.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.932
Lam not afraid of you.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.789
Dwight! Take it easy.
Take it easy.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.379
Calm down,
Dwight, you're badly hurt.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.340
We're losing him.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.093
Is he gone?

38:23.468 --> 38:24.845
Is he gone?

38:25.220 --> 38:28.565
Dwight, I saw it, Dwight.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.976
You repelled the beast.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.277
Yes.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.900
You saved me.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.784
I love you.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.247
Please, don't leave.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.086
It's over.
Please, don't go.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.088
It's over. He's free.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.637
Dwight might be,
but none of you are.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.729
You're under arrest for the kidnapping
and murder of Dwight Eleazer.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.520
We saved him.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.771
Amen.

39:13.726 --> 39:14.898
You have
the right to remain silent

39:14.978 --> 39:16.178
and refuse to
answer questions.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.565
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

39:18.815 --> 39:22.285
He took my sins away

39:27.115 --> 39:28.617
It's all right.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.374
This has never
happened to me before.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.209
Don't worry about it.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.466
Let's, um...

39:38.376 --> 39:39.798
Let's start with
your questions.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.630
Yes. Okay.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.760
And we can try again.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.642
Like we did last time.

40:02.859 --> 40:03.951
What's happening?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.987
It divides the spectrum
into bands.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.664
If there's anything there,
we should get an image.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.956
Got some Aramaic here,

40:14.787 --> 40:16.915
and some form of Latin.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.170
I think what you got
here is very, very old.

40:21.794 --> 40:22.795
We do, too.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.515
So your uncle had this?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.057
You bet.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.387
Hidden in his attic for, you
know, who knows how long.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.480
Well, I wonder
where he got it from.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.392
Let's up
the thermal sensitivity.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.688
It appears to have been
wrapped around something.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.031
I wonder what it says.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.335
I don't think
it's classical Latin,

40:52.367 --> 40:54.870
it looks more
like archaic Latin.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.830
Spell out the letters of
the most complete word.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.039
Okay.

40:59.499 --> 41:03.345
Ah... "M-I-P..."

41:03.711 --> 41:07.932
Well, "P" in archaic is "R" in
classical, so that would be an "M-I-R."

41:08.049 --> 41:09.892
I can't make
out the next letter.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.144
Maybe an "A" or an

41:12.387 --> 41:13.513
I think that's an "A."

41:13.596 --> 41:14.597
Unless it's a

41:15.264 --> 41:16.982
It can't be a
Not with "M-I-R."

41:17.058 --> 41:20.403
The last three
letters are "L-V-M."

41:20.687 --> 41:21.939
"V" would be "U."

41:22.021 --> 41:26.242
So the closest word to that is

41:27.193 --> 41:29.287
"miraculum, " which means...

41:29.529 --> 41:30.530
Miracle.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.498
That would explain
what happened to your arm.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.665
Sort of.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.541
What's the next most
complete word you've got?

41:38.121 --> 41:41.170
Uh, but it looks
more like a hook.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.755
That is a

41:44.085 --> 41:47.339
The next letter's
and then which is

41:48.548 --> 41:50.016
That's definitely an

41:51.092 --> 41:54.096
"K," something, "L,"

41:54.178 --> 41:57.102
something,

41:58.224 --> 41:59.350
something, "M."

41:59.517 --> 42:01.019
There's only one
word that could be.

42:02.395 --> 42:03.442
"Periculosum."

42:03.688 --> 42:04.780
What does that mean?

42:05.314 --> 42:08.944
Hazardous,
perilous, threatening,

42:10.611 --> 42:11.612
dangerous.
