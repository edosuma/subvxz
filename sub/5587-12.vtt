WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.234
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Back in the '80s before</i>
<i> we could easily text money</i>

00:02.236 --> 00:05.237
<i> to any charity we wished,</i>
<i> we had the world-famous</i>
<i> charity craze</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:07.740
<i> that completely</i>
<i> swept the entire country.</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.776
Hands Across America.
It's happening
this weekend,

00:10.778 --> 00:14.113
and you will not make
coach look bad.

00:14.115 --> 00:14.913
All right, listen up.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.216
This limited-edition,
government-issued visor

00:17.218 --> 00:20.719
means that I have been
personally appointed
regional captain

00:20.721 --> 00:22.021
because I volunteered.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.423
It is my duty to make sure
everybody in this town

00:24.425 --> 00:27.359
forms a human chain
to stop the homeless.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.927
Questions.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.029
Goldberg.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.964
Isn't it kind of mean
to form a chain

00:31.966 --> 00:33.866
and not let
the homeless people
pass through?

00:33.868 --> 00:34.900
That was
my first thought, too,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.969
but it was explained to me
that we would be allowing

00:36.971 --> 00:39.138
the homeless to come
and go as they please.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.305
Goldberg again.

00:40.307 --> 00:40.973
Still confused.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.574
Um, how does holding hands
help anyone?

00:42.576 --> 00:45.277
Hello. Everyone
in America is gonna
hold hands at once

00:45.279 --> 00:46.879
to show we are
symbolically unified

00:46.881 --> 00:48.981
in our fight
to end homelessness.

00:48.983 --> 00:49.748
It's beautiful, really.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.217
Hell, I wish I had
more than two hands.

00:52.219 --> 00:52.985
Yes, we get it.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.154
You're the
socially aware girl.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.657
No reason to showboat
about it, other Goldberg.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.458
I'll stop talking.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.628
Now, in the spirit
of the event,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.663
let's hit the floor
and practice.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.132
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
Let's go! Move it!

01:07.134 --> 01:08.901
Grab and squeeze, people!

01:08.903 --> 01:10.602
Interlace those fingers!

01:10.604 --> 01:11.203
Engage every digit!

01:11.205 --> 01:14.940
I want to see hustle,
and I want
to see determination!

01:14.942 --> 01:17.276
Yeah! Let me feel it!

01:17.411 --> 01:20.512
There it is.
A chain.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.553
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:27.555 --> 01:32.324
<i> ¶ But nonetheless,</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:34.993
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:34.995 --> 01:38.363
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:38.365 --> 01:41.533
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was the</i>
<i> second Wednesday of the month,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:42.634
<i> and the Harvest Hop</i>
<i> was coming up.</i>

01:42.636 --> 01:45.804
<i> It was the first dance</i>
<i> where you had</i>
<i> to ask someone.</i>

01:45.806 --> 01:47.506
I mean, seriously,
why do I have to wait

01:47.508 --> 01:50.275
for some meathead
to ask me
to a lame-ass dance?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.411
Because that's how
society works.

01:52.413 --> 01:52.978
Count me out.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.047
Well, I have it
on good authority

01:55.049 --> 01:57.583
that Adam Abel is going
to ask someone today.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.385
(SCOFFS) I could give
a crap about that nerd.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.154
(GASPS)
He's coming this way.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.355
Go, go, go!

02:03.357 --> 02:04.389
Hey.

02:04.391 --> 02:08.794
Pam, you, um, have a date
to the dance and stuff?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.863
PAM: (CHUCKLES) No.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.432
Are you okay?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.033
(BLOWS RASPBERRIES)

02:15.035 --> 02:16.468
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

02:16.470 --> 02:17.836
Why wouldn't I be?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.438
(SOBBING)

02:19.440 --> 02:22.274
You sure you're okay?
No, genius.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.443
I'm like the only girl
who didn't get asked.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.677
That's
freaking humiliating.

02:25.679 --> 02:30.415
Well, you can always
go with your awesome
best friend.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.150
Ew.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.951
Stop!
It'll be fun.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.386
We can goof on everyone.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.754
Dana can't fly out
to go with me.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.157
This way
we're not total losers
without dates.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.425
Normally, I'd roll my eyes
and punch you,

02:40.427 --> 02:43.162
but honestly,
I'm desperate, so yes.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.730
Dear God, yes.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.031
Get off me, dork.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.100
You're
a complicated person.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.835
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> the only good thing</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.203
<i> about having</i>
<i> a girlfriend in Seattle</i>

02:51.205 --> 02:53.839
<i> was I was completely free</i>
<i> to help out a friend.</i>

02:53.841 --> 02:55.908
(DOORBELL RINGS)
<i> Or not.</i>

02:55.910 --> 02:56.775
Surprise!
What? Why?

02:56.777 --> 03:00.612
My grandma broke her hip,
so my parents
are letting me visit her.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.647
So lucky.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.882
For us.
She's bummed.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.450
So we get to go
to the dance!

03:05.452 --> 03:07.286
Yeah, about the dance.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.254
Oh, my God.
You're not excited.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.891
You're going
with someone else?
Are we not us anymore?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.626
No, of course we're us.

03:14.628 --> 03:18.931
I'm going with you,
my girlfriend,
who I love.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.332
Mmm!

03:20.334 --> 03:21.300
I'm so excited.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.267
Me also excited.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.670
ADULT ADAM: <i> As I was reeling</i>
<i> from my two dates</i>
<i> to the dance,</i>

03:24.672 --> 03:27.773
<i> my mom was reeling</i>
<i> after a visit</i>
<i> with Virginia Kremp.</i>

03:27.775 --> 03:30.842
BEVERLY: Is that
your family at the
flower show again?

03:30.844 --> 03:33.745
<i> The Inquirer</i>
put your picture
in the paper last year.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.648
Oh, well, Charles won
top florist again.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.952
His topiary of Rosa Parks
was the real star.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.353
Well, all I know
is you got another

03:41.355 --> 03:43.322
stunning picture
of your whole family.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.757
You're like the freaking
Kennedys of Jenkintown.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.126
Please, no, we're not.
Do people
really say that?

03:48.128 --> 03:51.964
I'd give anything
to have just one photo
of me and my babies

03:51.966 --> 03:54.566
looking that happy
on the front page
of the paper.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.768
Well, Barry did make
the paper for that time

03:56.770 --> 03:58.403
he got in the fight
with the service horse.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.439
He really thought
it was his apple.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.740
Horses are tricky.
Yeah.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.908
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Little did my mom know</i>

04:02.910 --> 04:05.744
<i> her photo op</i>
<i> was right around the corner.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:06.979
BEVERLY: Oh, my God.

04:06.981 --> 04:10.649
Are you two
crafting together?

04:10.851 --> 04:11.416
By choice?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.352
No, no, no, calm down.
We're not crafting.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.121
We're just making art
with construction paper,

04:16.123 --> 04:18.890
markers, and glitter
for public display.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.058
That's crafting.

04:20.060 --> 04:20.993
Fine, we're crafting.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.528
We need to spread the word
about Hands Across America.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.797
Yeah, I don't know
about that whole thing.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.665
Hands have germs.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.134
Think of all those colds
passing across the country

04:29.136 --> 04:30.669
like a big
bacteria highway. Ugh.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.373
Whatever. I'm doing it
because it'll help
people in real need.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.476
And I'm doing it
for the celebrity contact.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.778
Hoping to hold hands
with Heather Locklear.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.846
No. Alyssa Milano.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.181
No. KITT, the car
from <i> Knight Rider.</i>

04:43.183 --> 04:45.183
You can't hold hands
with a car, idiot.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.319
I'll hold the antenna.
Wait a minute.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.387
Celebrities
are doing this?

04:48.389 --> 04:51.890
Yeah, downtown Philly
actually nabbed Scott Baio.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.159
From <i> Happy Days</i>
and <i> Chachi In Charge?</i>

04:54.161 --> 04:54.893
Don't forget <i> Zapped!</i>

04:54.895 --> 04:58.363
Where he uses
his magic powers
to lift girls' dresses.

04:58.365 --> 04:58.997
Turn that off.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.066
Point is this thing's
gonna be a huge deal.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.669
It's literally going to be
on the front page
of all the papers.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.271
You mean
like newspapers?

05:06.273 --> 05:10.075
Like the kind
that take pictures
of moms and their kids?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.643
What?

05:14.181 --> 05:14.946
What happened?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.449
I want to help
with Hands Across America.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.817
Okay.
And by help, I mean

05:18.819 --> 05:21.086
push you aside
and take over entirely.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.020
I said okay.
Really?

05:22.022 --> 05:25.557
I'm in way over my head.
They want me to organize,
make posters.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.025
They gave me a pen
and a ledger.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.360
I don't know what to do
with them.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.761
To record the donations.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.429
Oh, no, I...

05:30.431 --> 05:32.764
I've been putting
everybody's cash
in a bag.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.832
Well, there must be
thousands there.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.202
I don't know.
I'm a gym teacher,
I'm not a count teacher.

05:37.204 --> 05:37.936
You mean a math teacher?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.805
I don't know.
I'm not an
English teacher, either.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.939
Did you at least get us
a celebrity?

05:40.941 --> 05:44.409
No, th...
We can't compete
with Philly.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.345
Philly is the Paris
of Pennsylvania.

05:46.347 --> 05:49.147
They got Baio.
We got jack squat.

05:49.149 --> 05:49.848
You should go rest.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.450
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom</i>
<i> was saving Coach Mellor,</i>

05:51.452 --> 05:55.087
<i> I was racing for the one man</i>
<i> who always rescued me.</i>

05:55.089 --> 05:55.687
Dad.
Yes.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.155
I need help.
Where's Pops?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.024
There he is.
Thank God.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.293
Pops, I have two dates
to the dance.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.494
Way to go, kiddo!

06:02.496 --> 06:03.862
No, it's a bad thing.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.529
Oh, yeah, it is.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.733
No, I agreed to go
with Emmy Mirsky
to cheer her up

06:07.735 --> 06:08.467
but Dana flew in.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.236
Then just tell Emmy
you're going with Dana.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.471
She'll understand.
No, she won't.

06:12.473 --> 06:16.408
A guy dissed her,
and I saw her cry
for the first time ever.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.076
Then just tell Dana
you can't go with her.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.446
She'll freak out
if I go with
another girl,

06:21.448 --> 06:22.047
even if it is Emmy.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.316
Then take them both.
They never even
have to know.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.084
Like Peter did
on <i> The Brady Bunch?</i>

06:26.086 --> 06:30.622
I Brady-bunched
two ladies at a USO dance
back in '41.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.824
Never felt so alive.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.725
Stop.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.627
Nobody's
Brady-bunching anyone.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.829
You want
some real advice?

06:38.031 --> 06:38.830
Don't be a moron.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.600
Seriously?
That's your advice
for everything.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.968
It applies
to everything.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.470
I think I'm gonna stick
with Pops' advice.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.174
All right, time
for a TV master class

06:49.176 --> 06:51.109
on how to juggle
two dates at once.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
First up,
the gold standard...

06:53.013 --> 06:55.180
<i> The Brady Bunch,</i>
and I'm Peter.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.282
Because your weird voice
cracks just like his?

06:57.284 --> 06:59.384
ADULT ADAM: <i> Despite that shot</i>
<i> at my self-esteem,</i>

06:59.386 --> 07:01.853
<i> I knew with the help</i>
<i> of my trusty TV shows,</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:04.055
<i> I could pull off</i>
<i> two dates at once.</i>

07:04.057 --> 07:06.758
Oh, no!
Peter Brady, you blew it.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.059
ADULT ADAM: <i> Or so I thought.</i>

07:08.061 --> 07:09.795
No!
Alex P. Keaton.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.164
ADULT ADAM: <i> Each one</i>
<i> was worse than the next.</i>

07:12.166 --> 07:13.098
Jack's screwed!

07:13.100 --> 07:14.399
Both women are
at the Regal Beagle.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.669
ADULT ADAM: <i> As we watched</i>
<i> the same plot done</i>
<i> on every show,</i>

07:17.671 --> 07:19.070
<i> it became abundantly clear.</i>

07:19.072 --> 07:21.640
Dude,
it can't be done.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.909
Shut up, Dave Kim!

07:23.911 --> 07:24.576
I see that.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.345
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my universe</i>
<i> as crumbling,</i>
<i> my mom saw a world</i>

07:27.347 --> 07:31.783
<i> where she finally got a photo</i>
<i> in the paper with her kids.</i>

07:31.785 --> 07:32.918
Yo, yo, yo, volunteers.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.620
Who's ready to get
this homeless
party started?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.955
Mom, what are you
doing here?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.391
You're looking at the new
regional captain

07:39.393 --> 07:40.525
for Hands Across America.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.760
What happened
to Coach Mellor?

07:41.762 --> 07:44.763
He cracked under
the pressure, but
don't worry. Mama's here.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.498
I know how important
this is for you.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.501
Yeah, I'm out.
Me too.
Shut it down, people.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.635
(ALL GROAN)

07:50.637 --> 07:51.937
Whoa, hold up.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.138
Now that I'm involved,
you're just gonna bail?

07:53.140 --> 07:56.508
Nothing personal.
You just make
fun things suck.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.075
Well, that...

07:57.077 --> 08:00.378
That is a shame because
this lady right here

08:00.380 --> 08:02.881
just got Scott Baio

08:02.883 --> 08:05.984
to ditch Philly
and come to J-town.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.153
Dude, we got
Fonzie's cousin.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.287
(ALL CHEERING)

08:09.289 --> 08:10.555
No, everyone stop.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.923
Mom, did you
really get Scott Baio?

08:11.925 --> 08:15.527
I literally just got off
the phone with Scotty B.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.195
He told me
to call him Scotty B.

08:17.197 --> 08:21.733
And he agreed to come here
and hold hands with me.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.502
I call the one
available hand.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.402
No way!
The hand is mine!

08:24.404 --> 08:26.805
Okay, this is my
future husband.
Why do you care?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.940
'Cause he's
my future best bro.

08:28.942 --> 08:29.875
And once Scott meets me,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.110
he'll ditch Willie Aames
and fly me to Hollywood

08:32.112 --> 08:33.512
so I never have to talk
to you people again.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.948
This is bullcrap.
Just 'cause your
crazy-hot mom is in charge,

08:36.950 --> 08:37.983
you guys both get dibs?

08:37.985 --> 08:40.151
Please,
Mrs. Goldberg, pick me.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.120
I really need a win.
So bad.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.255
No, I want...
Mom, you have seen...

08:43.257 --> 08:44.689
Scott's hand in my hand.
...his poster in my room.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.658
I bet my hands are cooler
than yours if we held
them together.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.659
Mrs. Goldberg...
(ALL CLAMORING)

08:47.661 --> 08:49.961
Stop fighting.
Stop fighting.
I'll sleep on it, okay?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.796
I'll sleep on it,
all right?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.532
But now I have
to immediately leave...

08:53.534 --> 08:56.401
Not to call Scott Baio
'cause I've done it.

08:56.403 --> 09:00.939
All right, I just...
I have to go
and do a thing.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.508
ADULT ADAM: <i> The dance</i>
<i> was only a day away,</i>

09:03.510 --> 09:05.510
<i> and I realized</i>
<i> my plan was a dead end.</i>

09:05.512 --> 09:09.147
Pops, I watched
all the shows.
Two dates never works.

09:09.149 --> 09:09.848
Not even on <i> Cheers?</i>

09:09.850 --> 09:13.952
Cliff had a date
with Carla and Diane
to the postman's ball.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.819
It was
a total junk show.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.923
See, I'm not a fan
of today's comedy.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.224
Now, <i> The Honeymooners...</i>

09:19.226 --> 09:20.759
I don't need a trip
down memory lane.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.361
I need help,
and you said
you pulled off

09:23.363 --> 09:25.430
the perfect
Brady Bunch. How?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.799
Actually, the women
kind of invited me.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.301
We've got some advice
for you.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.669
Yeah, yeah,
don't be a moron.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.071
If you know the advice,
why aren't you following it?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.774
Don't worry, kiddo.
Pops always has a plan.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.910
With my help,
you'll be the first kid
in history

09:38.912 --> 09:40.579
to juggle two dates
at a dance.

09:40.581 --> 09:43.148
Well, I did juggle
three grapes at camp.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.283
You know
who's not a moron?

09:45.285 --> 09:46.918
You're not a moron.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.186
You're not a moron.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.888
You're not a moron.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.589
No.
(BABBLES)

09:50.591 --> 09:52.857
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Pops</i>
<i> was convincing me</i>
<i> I could pull this off,</i>

09:52.859 --> 09:55.660
<i> Erica and Barry were ready</i>
<i> to convince our mom</i>

09:55.662 --> 09:58.330
<i> that they were worthy</i>
<i> of Baio's hand.</i>

09:58.332 --> 09:59.130
Erica, what's going on?

09:59.132 --> 10:02.100
Bad dream, mama.
Can we do spoonies?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.268
Oh, my god, spoonies?

10:03.270 --> 10:07.305
Get on in the
warm spot, girl.
(CHUCKLES)

10:07.541 --> 10:09.174
Ah.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.308
This is so nice.
Hmm.

10:10.310 --> 10:14.913
Speaking of, um,
any thoughts
about Scott Baio?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.781
Uh, yeah,
about that...

10:16.783 --> 10:18.016
Knock, knock.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.750
Who wants brekky in bed?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.952
(GASPS)
You made mama breakfast?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.854
Nobody cares
because I'm spending

10:22.856 --> 10:24.322
the whole day
with my favorite lady.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.524
You are?
Well, mom and I
are spending

10:26.526 --> 10:28.293
the entire
weekend together.
We are?

10:28.295 --> 10:29.995
Stop doing
what you're doing.
You stop.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.164
You're only giving spoons
so she'll pick you
to hold Baio's hand.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.468
Oh, and you're not?
What's with the
stupid sweater?

10:36.470 --> 10:37.636
My favorite sweater?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.738
Mommy made it
for my 12th birthday.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.839
I feel so handsome,
Mommy.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.675
You look so handsome,
schmoofers.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.442
She's the sun.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.311
I'm the moon.
You're the moon!

10:46.313 --> 10:49.114
Okay, you want
to go to war?
Let's go.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.917
Mommy, I want you
to pick out a guy for me
to date and marry.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.886
That is my dream.
No, no, no! Not so fast.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.989
I've been thinking about it,
and I'm gonna let you
dance with me

10:57.991 --> 11:00.659
before I dance
with my bride
at my wedding.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.662
That is also my dream,
but I also get to wear white.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.630
That's non-negotiable.
Yes!

11:05.632 --> 11:06.398
I'm gonna have five kids,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.967
and I want you to babysit
every night and tell me
what to do.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.168
You will live
with me forever.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.904
I will build a mother suite
off the master bedroom

11:12.906 --> 11:15.073
even if it severely damages
my marriage.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.775
(GASPS)
I'm out.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.343
It's too rich for my blood.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.577
Yes! I win!

11:19.579 --> 11:22.514
Oh, no,
what have I done?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.248
Future Barry's problem.

11:23.250 --> 11:27.052
ADULT ADAM: <i> Despite herself,</i>
<i> my mom loved her kids</i>
<i> fighting over her.</i>

11:27.054 --> 11:27.752
<i> Just one problem...</i>

11:27.754 --> 11:32.891
<i> She was now pulling</i>
<i> a classic bail and switch</i>
<i> and needed a way out.</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:36.294
We need to talk.

11:36.296 --> 11:36.928
Whoa, not so fast.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.064
That was a non-sanctioned
sit-down. On your feet.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.500
Please, I need your help.
This whole thing has
gotten away from me.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.537
No, no, coach has washed his
hands of hands across America.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.773
Look, all I wanted was
one photo op with my kids.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.276
Now, they're fighting
over my love to get to Baio.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.779
That feather-haired man-boy
is making all my dreams
come true.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.481
That's why we need to get him
here instead of Philly.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.451
Give up on your
Baio dreams.
It ain't happening.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.921
It has to happen.
I told the whole school
he's coming here.

12:02.923 --> 12:03.988
What? Why would
you do that?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.524
I thought I could work
my Yenta magic,

12:06.526 --> 12:07.992
but I've been calling
for three days.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.494
Baio's people
are icing me out.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.729
Well, how the hell
can I help?

12:10.731 --> 12:13.765
Come on, you must have
at least one celebrity lead.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.632
No, I'm a gym teacher.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.868
I rotate two pairs
of shorts.

12:16.870 --> 12:17.802
Then I guess it's over.

12:17.804 --> 12:22.107
Unless you got out and you
get yourself a celebrity
that's better than Baio.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.975
Better than Baio?
Is that possible?

12:23.977 --> 12:27.145
It is with one of my patented
game-day pep talks.

12:27.147 --> 12:27.879
Now, listen up.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.547
It's the fourth quarter.
You're down by 1 point.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.751
Who's gonna run the option
and take it to the big house?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.619
Run the what?
(SIGHS)

12:34.621 --> 12:36.321
All right.
It's 11:00 p.m.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.089
You just got off a flight
with your family.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.724
They're crabby.
They're hungry.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.159
You look
in the cupboard.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.794
Oh, all you got
is one can of tuna.

12:42.796 --> 12:46.297
But it doesn't matter
'cause there's only
one person

12:46.299 --> 12:48.066
that can feed
those babies tuna

12:48.068 --> 12:50.969
and make sure they go to
sleep with full tum-tums.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.904
Me!
You're damn right it's you.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.240
Now go out and get yourself
the biggest celebrity

12:55.242 --> 12:58.109
this god-forsaken town's
ever seen.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.978

Oh.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.147
Sorry. My bad, little ones.
You guys okay?

13:02.149 --> 13:05.817
All right,
let's take a breather.
Who wants water?

ADULT ADAM: <i> That night,</i>
<i> I was also on a mission.</i>

13:07.587 --> 13:10.622
<i> Make a foolproof plan</i>
<i> to bring two dates</i>
<i> to the same dance.</i>

13:10.624 --> 13:15.093
All right, boys,
let's run this again.
What are we looking at?

13:15.095 --> 13:16.294
The gym is 94x50 feet.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.297
That leave us with
two large zones to
keep the girls apart.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.799
Check.
Let's talk song list.

13:20.801 --> 13:25.670
We're looking at 16 songs
lasting 2 hours and 6 minutes
including <i> The Time Warp.</i>

13:25.672 --> 13:27.906
Okay, let's do a dry run.
Adam.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.041
The Terrordrome
is our battlefield.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.776
I'm Michelangelo.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.145
Dana is Princess Leia.

Emmy's the Hulk.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.215
Copy! Song 1?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.883
<i> Like A Prayer,</i> Madonna.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.584
Dana and I dance.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.686
Then I say I got to hit
the bathroom and
run to Emmy.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.656
Song 2?
<i> Careless Whisper,</i>
Wham!

13:44.658 --> 13:46.324
I tell Emmy
I'll grab her punch

13:46.326 --> 13:48.426
then run back to Dana
for a slow dance.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.262
I interrupt and pretend
I lost my contact lens.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.465
I leave to help Dave Kim,
then book it back to Emmy.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.602
See that?
Working as a team together.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.605

Hello, my name is Dave Kim.
I lost my contact lens.

14:10.050 --> 14:13.151
Dana, can you help me
find it for 8 to 10 minutes
out of earshot?

14:13.153 --> 14:16.187
Not now, Dave Kim.
It's gone to hell.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.922
We didn't even make it
out of the house.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.825
I know. I know!
Two dates can't be done!

14:20.827 --> 14:24.128
Dude, he's created a whole
nerd world to plot against us.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.797
This is super-creepy,

14:25.799 --> 14:27.699
My God, did you
make me the Hulk?

14:27.701 --> 14:30.435
Yes, but only 'cause I don't
like you when you're angry.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.071
This is so scheming
and disrespectful.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.340
No, please, don't start
doubting my character.

alone, liar.

No, no, no.

in the shadows, okay?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.768
What are you
talking about?

Today is the day
that me and my kids

finally get on the front page
of the newspaper.

No exceptions.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.509
Yes, I'll hide
with you people.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.278
Block my head with
your enormous hair.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.712
I'm so nervous for Baio.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.281
My hands are super-sweaty
but soft.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.483
I've been
moisturizing all day.
So where is he?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.618
Yeah, where's
the Scottster anyway?
Oh, my God, no!

15:20.620 --> 15:24.022
You can't lure Scott
with your off-the-shoulder
crop top and short skirt.

15:24.024 --> 15:28.760
You really think I would use
my young feminine form to get
Scott Baio's attention?

I do look good,
though, right?

15:30.230 --> 15:32.597
Uh, actually, I have
some good news, bad news.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.800
Uh, the bad news
is baio's not coming.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.669
What?
You monster!

15:37.671 --> 15:38.536
No, stop it.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.905
I actually got
a bigger celebrity.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.685
Good morrow,
fellow colonists.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.087
I am founding father,
Benjamin Franklin.

15:56.089 --> 16:00.258
Allow me to gaze upon you
through my bifocals,

16:00.260 --> 16:01.859
which I invented in 1784.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.994
Why is this thing
still talking?

16:02.996 --> 16:06.197
Ooh, the paper's here.
Okay, everybody,
hold hands and sing.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.767
Bev, I don't think the rest of
the country is ready just yet.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.369
You never even had
Scott Baio, did you?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.304
No time to talk.
All right, Adam...

16:13.306 --> 16:14.405
Stop hiding in my hair.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.408
Ooh! Emmy, Dana, come and hold
hands and take a picture.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.577
We'd rather not.
They'd really rather not.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.079
Okay, well,
it's not a choice.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.147
Every hand not held
is another homeless family.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.216
I don't think...
Okay, just do it,
just do it, just do it.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.618
Photographers!
Smile, smile.
Teeth, teeth.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.656
I'd like to, but they're
crushing my bones with
their strong lady hands.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.359
Mine, too.
I'm just a pawn!

16:34.361 --> 16:37.061
(BOTH GROANING)

16:37.063 --> 16:38.196
This is a nightmare!

16:38.198 --> 16:41.299
How are they
stronger than us?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.501
ADULT ADAM:
<i> The moment had come.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:47.005
<i> It was finally time to hold</i>
<i> Hands Across America.</i>

16:47.007 --> 16:48.806
Boys, quick!
Grab mommy's hands!

16:48.808 --> 16:50.141
Holy crap, it's happening.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.843
Okay. Come on, you guys.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.544
You've got to
hold my hand.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.879
Hold my hand, damn it!

16:54.881 --> 16:56.547
No way. You lied to us.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.182
Beverly,
what are you doing?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.051
Come on, it's time.
Hold hands.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.085
Kids, do it.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.854
Never.
Hold my hands.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.088
We will hold no hands.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.057
What is wrong
with you people?!

17:06.059 --> 17:07.225
Please!
No way.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.693
This is for the homeless!

17:08.695 --> 17:09.660
Hold my hands.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.762
No way.
Hold hands!

17:10.764 --> 17:12.997
Please,
just hold my hands.

17:12.999 --> 17:13.898
Never.
No way.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.833
Hold hands!
I shall hold your hand.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.102
Oh, (BLEEP) off,
Ben Franklin.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.904
Mom, no!
Back off, Mom.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.639
I'm not holding
your hand.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

17:21.641 --> 17:24.075
No, no, don't put
that in the paper.

17:24.077 --> 17:27.311
It's gonna look like
the Goldbergs broke
hands across America.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.080
Goldbergs... Got it.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.181
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

17:30.183 --> 17:30.915
Oh, that's a keeper.

17:30.917 --> 17:34.485
ADULT ADAM: <i> And so,</i>
<i> Hands Across America was</i>
<i> single-handedly a bust.</i>

17:34.487 --> 17:38.956
All I wanted was one
nice photo for the wall.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.559
That's all
I ever wanted.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.962
No. No, you're the one
who lied.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.198
You can't make us
feel bad about this.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.803
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom's</i>
<i> spirit was crushed,</i>
<i> so were my hands.</i>

17:51.871 --> 17:53.504
Hey. How you holding up?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.274
Well, I've got no girlfriend,
no best friend,

17:56.276 --> 17:59.944
and no feeling in both hands,
so not good.

17:59.946 --> 18:00.645
You know what I think?

18:00.647 --> 18:03.247
Yes, I'm a moron.
I get it.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.783
No,
I don't think you do.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.387
When I say,
"don't be a moron,"

18:09.389 --> 18:10.421
it really means something.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.890
You mean beyond just
being rude and insulting?

18:12.892 --> 18:14.258
Yeah, that's just
part of it.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.228
But it's my way
of saying

18:17.230 --> 18:18.830
"be honest,
be a good person."

18:18.832 --> 18:23.701
It's how I live my life,
and you know what? It works.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.805
So, how do I make it up
to Emmy and Dana?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.308
That's easy.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.110
Don't be a moron.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.912
ADULT ADAM:
<i> After years of getting</i>
<i> advice on girls from Pops,</i>

18:34.914 --> 18:38.783
<i> I learned my dad</i>
<i> had some wisdom</i>
<i> to offer after all.</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:39.851
What the hell are
you doing, weirdo?

18:39.853 --> 18:44.255
I'm cordially and
blatantly inviting
you both to the dance.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.256
You can't be serious.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.459
Look, I screwed up,
but you have to believe me

18:48.461 --> 18:51.262
all I wanted was to make
both of you feel special.

18:51.264 --> 18:54.932
Emmy, you've been
my best friend since
second grade.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.502
I just couldn't bear
to see you so sad.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.770
And, Dana, the last thing
I'd ever want to do is

18:59.772 --> 19:02.974
to hurt the girl I love more
than anything in this world.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.711
Aww.
Point is I'm a moron.

19:08.281 --> 19:08.980
We'll got get dressed.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.150
ADULT ADAM: <i> As it turns out,</i>
<i> the best plan of all</i>
<i> was honesty.</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:15.486
<i> And because of that,</i>
<i> I was able to do what</i>
<i> Alex P. Keaton,</i>

19:15.488 --> 19:19.123
<i> Jack Tripper, and</i>
<i> Peter Brady never could...</i>

19:19.125 --> 19:22.727
<i> ...take two girls</i>
<i> to the same dance.</i>

19:22.729 --> 19:23.728
<i> And not just any girls...</i>

19:23.730 --> 19:26.597
<i> ...the most important ones</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

19:26.599 --> 19:30.668
<i> And it was a night</i>
<i> I always remember.</i>

19:34.874 --> 19:37.742
Crying at <i> Zapped!</i>
That's a first.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.411
No, I just... (SIGHS)

19:40.580 --> 19:42.113
I feel bad.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.080
I'm a bad mama.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.716
I don't think any of us
were at our best.

19:45.718 --> 19:49.153
Which actually worked
in our favor.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.891
This... is not
what I meant at all.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.060
I know we're not actually
holding hands,

19:56.062 --> 19:59.931
but if this picture isn't us,
(SCOFFS) I don't know what is.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.866
You're right.

20:02.902 --> 20:03.935
I love it.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.837
ADULT ADAM: <i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about the people you love.</i>

20:06.839 --> 20:07.872
<i> It's not always</i>
<i> picture-perfect.</i>

20:07.874 --> 20:11.909
<i> Sometimes you have to</i>
<i> live in the moment</i>
<i> and take it all in.</i>

20:11.911 --> 20:14.612
<i> But side-by-side,</i>
<i> hand-in-hand...</i>

20:14.614 --> 20:16.380
<i> ...you'll find</i>
<i> it's pretty great.</i>

20:16.382 --> 20:19.884
<i> And sure, you may make a lot</i>
<i> of mistakes along the way.</i>

20:19.886 --> 20:21.219
<i> Growing up is a tricky dance,</i>

20:21.221 --> 20:24.155
<i> but occasionally,</i>
<i> you find your groove.</i>

20:24.157 --> 20:26.524
Last dance of the night.
Have fun, dorks.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.927
Actually, I don't think
you should take off just yet.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.896
I talked to Adam Abel.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.598
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna kill you.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.701
He saved you a dance.
I love you.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.269
(GROANS)

20:39.606 --> 20:43.040
<i> ¶ Ooh, heaven is a place</i>
<i> On Earth</i>

20:43.042 --> 20:46.877
<i> ¶ They say in heaven,</i>
<i> Love comes first</i>

20:46.879 --> 20:51.616
<i> ¶ We'll make heaven</i>
<i> A place on earth ¶</i>

20:52.418 --> 20:55.086
¶

20:56.256 --> 20:58.289
(DINGING)

20:59.726 --> 21:02.693
Ugh. I don't understand
how we all got the flu.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.429
I told you...
With all that hand holding,
you'd catch a bug.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.832
Will you stop saying that.
It's not even how it works.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.300
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Ooh, sounds like

21:09.302 --> 21:11.235
we may have
a special visitor.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.838
Wait, did Scott Baio's people
finally get back to you?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.308
No, but, uh,
I still have

21:17.310 --> 21:19.977
Ben Franklin rented
for an hour.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.113
Good morrow,
sick children.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.283
As I so famously said
in 1780-something,

21:25.285 --> 21:27.852
An apple a day
keeps the doctor...

21:27.854 --> 21:29.053
No!
Not again.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.821
I hate this president.
