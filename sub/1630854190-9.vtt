WEBVTT

00:31.877 --> 00:33.966
Down on the ground!

00:40.668 --> 00:43.018
Jane? What the hell
were you going to do?

00:45.238 --> 00:47.153
We can't lose this restaurant.

00:47.284 --> 00:48.807
It's my entire life's work.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.854
Mm. Aah! Aah!

00:54.334 --> 00:55.335
Oh.

00:55.466 --> 00:57.294
- Hey, it's you.
- Yeah, it's me,

00:57.424 --> 00:59.383
your landlord. Were you gonna
binoculars me to death?

00:59.513 --> 01:00.862
No, it's... I don't...

01:00.993 --> 01:03.082
- I'm not awake yet.
- Okay. Whatever.

01:03.213 --> 01:05.127
This is your reminder--
Chuck and I are going to Maui,

01:05.258 --> 01:06.868
leaving right now
for five days.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.044
Oh, right.
I forgot about that.

01:09.175 --> 01:10.959
And we don't want you going
in the house while we're gone.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.961
- What? I live there.
- This is the garage.

01:13.092 --> 01:15.312
- It's a separate unit.
- No. I'm in there all the time.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.357
And you don't go in there
- while we're not here, okay?
- Well,

01:17.488 --> 01:18.445
hold on a second.
Where am I supposed to shower?

01:18.576 --> 01:20.621
- I don't know. The hose.
- The hose? What?

01:20.752 --> 01:21.709
- It's December.
- Or you can go to a gym.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.928
What am I, the family dog?

01:23.058 --> 01:24.364
Okay, okay, can you please?

01:24.495 --> 01:25.800
This is one single boundary

01:25.931 --> 01:27.280
that Chuck and I are attempting
to draw.

01:27.411 --> 01:29.630
A boundary that says
you don't trust me.

01:31.197 --> 01:32.067
Can you please
just do this one thing?

01:32.198 --> 01:33.286
Please? Thank you.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.419
Yes? Okay. Aloha.

01:37.159 --> 01:39.249
Aloha to you, too.

01:39.379 --> 01:41.076
A skiing accident?

01:41.207 --> 01:43.296
Beaman broke his leg
in three places. Oh.

01:43.427 --> 01:45.994
Apparently, the bunny hill is
more dangerous than it seems.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.258
So I'm picking up the slack
and inheriting the case.

01:48.388 --> 01:50.042
And it's a Beaman case, so...

01:50.172 --> 01:51.522
Which means, last minute,

01:51.652 --> 01:54.002
sloppy, and you'll be
the detail-oriented one

01:54.133 --> 01:55.830
cleaning up his mess.

01:55.961 --> 01:57.223
Yeah. What am I even
arguing again?

01:57.354 --> 01:59.138
Motion to dismiss
on a wrongful termination.

01:59.269 --> 02:00.574
Motion to dismiss. Okay.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.967
PDtroniX is the company.

02:02.097 --> 02:03.664
Here's the CEO,
our client.

02:03.795 --> 02:04.883
Graham Tate,

02:05.013 --> 02:07.015
Margaret Wright.
She'll be filling in

02:07.146 --> 02:08.408
for your attorney Nick Beaman.

02:08.539 --> 02:09.844
Pleased to meet you.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.368
Uh, I've been briefed
on the motion,

02:11.498 --> 02:12.760
but I'd love to hear
the details from you.

02:12.891 --> 02:14.196
Thank you, Francey.

02:14.327 --> 02:18.331
So, you and the plaintiff
Jane Lin...

02:18.462 --> 02:20.072
Founded PDtroniX together... Uh-huh.

02:20.202 --> 02:22.161
- ...almost four years ago.
- Okay.

02:22.292 --> 02:24.337
Everything was fine
until about six months ago.

02:24.468 --> 02:26.905
When Jane's behavior
became erratic,

02:27.035 --> 02:28.472
and she became
personally unstable,

02:28.602 --> 02:29.908
and you fired her.

02:30.038 --> 02:31.388
Erratic how?

02:31.518 --> 02:33.694
She was disruptive to the work

02:33.825 --> 02:36.001
and disrespectful
to coworkers.
Mm-hmm.

02:36.131 --> 02:38.438
There were complaints,
and she was, uh, disciplined.

02:38.569 --> 02:39.961
It's all documented.

02:40.092 --> 02:42.094
So, what is the basis
of her suing?

02:42.224 --> 02:44.444
Jane was let go
right before the launch

02:44.575 --> 02:47.012
of our big app
Unexpected Flame.

02:48.013 --> 02:50.798
It's a dating app that
went stratospheric... Oh.

02:50.929 --> 02:52.452
...because of its unique design.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.716
Ah.
Since she was fired
before its release,

02:55.847 --> 02:57.501
she doesn't share
in its profits.

02:57.631 --> 02:59.938
Well, contractually, she got all
the vesting she was entitled to,

03:00.068 --> 03:01.635
up to the day
she was fired.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.159
So I assume she's looking
for a big settlement?

03:04.290 --> 03:06.814
She stopped talking to me.

03:08.512 --> 03:09.861
Last night she broke
into the office

03:09.991 --> 03:11.819
with a knife.
She was arrested

03:11.950 --> 03:14.039
for breaking and entering
and attempted assault.

03:14.169 --> 03:16.258
She's out on bail, and

03:16.389 --> 03:17.782
the judge issued a temporary
restraining order.

03:17.912 --> 03:20.175
She's just proved that
her firing was well-founded.

03:20.306 --> 03:22.177
We'll take that to the judge,

03:22.308 --> 03:24.441
he'll dismiss the case,
and you can

03:24.571 --> 03:26.704
move on
from this difficult time.

03:28.749 --> 03:31.709
I'm just gonna get some water.
Be right back.

03:33.450 --> 03:35.147
She banned me from her house.

03:35.277 --> 03:36.540
I mean, I live there.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.150
Can I sue her?

03:38.280 --> 03:39.891
You live in the garage, Todd.

03:40.021 --> 03:41.632
I wouldn't want you
in my condo alone.

03:41.762 --> 03:44.156
Why? Because I'm some plundering
vandal who can't be trusted?

03:44.286 --> 03:47.986
Well, yes. I understand you ate
all the cereal in their house.

03:48.116 --> 03:49.770
Oh, give me a break.
It's cereal.

03:49.901 --> 03:52.425
Cereal's for everyone, and why
did you call me down here again?

03:52.556 --> 03:55.297
I am subbing in on
a last-minute motion to dismiss.

03:55.428 --> 03:58.213
It should be a slam dunk,
but it's a Nick Beaman case.

03:58.344 --> 04:00.999
So, God only knows what kind
of prep he did or didn't do.

04:01.129 --> 04:03.393
I need you as an extra set
of eyes and ears

04:03.523 --> 04:05.438
to catch anything
he might have missed.

04:05.569 --> 04:07.701
Great. So you trust me
with important work tasks.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.703
Meanwhile, Allison won't
even let me shower?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.880
Uh, trust is earned,
Todd, over time.

04:13.011 --> 04:15.056
And if you want to earn mine,
you will get in there

04:15.187 --> 04:17.755
and pay attention.
Go on, get.

04:20.801 --> 04:23.891
The court will now hear
<i>Jane Lin v. PDtroniX.</i>

04:24.022 --> 04:26.241
Wrongful termination suit.

04:26.372 --> 04:28.679
- You had me arrested?
- What was I supposed to do?

04:28.809 --> 04:29.723
- Tell the truth.
- You brought a knife.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.246
Believe me.

04:33.553 --> 04:34.641
We have counsel?

04:34.772 --> 04:36.643
Yes. Uh, Margaret Wright
for the defense.

04:36.774 --> 04:38.471
Um, and I understand

04:38.602 --> 04:39.864
that Miss Lin is acting

04:39.994 --> 04:41.909
pro se,
so since she is on her own,

04:42.040 --> 04:44.259
then we'll... Apologies, Your Honor. Apologies.

04:44.390 --> 04:46.174
Gus Easton for the plaintiff.

04:46.305 --> 04:47.349
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.134
You're plaintiff's counsel?

04:49.264 --> 04:51.397
No. No, no. Do not
needle me right now, all right?

04:51.528 --> 04:54.531
I'm intermittent fasting
and I can't eat for another

04:54.661 --> 04:56.054
two and a half hours,
so I have no sense of humor

04:56.184 --> 04:58.012
- until 11:45.
- Well,

04:58.143 --> 05:00.754
I'm just fascinated that you
would take on a violent offender

05:00.885 --> 05:04.366
suing her former company for
what-- executing good judgment?

05:04.497 --> 05:05.846
Um, Counsel,

05:05.977 --> 05:07.631
can we...?MARGARET:
Yes, Your Honor.

05:07.761 --> 05:10.721
Defense's motion
to dismiss is only bolstered

05:10.851 --> 05:12.592
by plaintiff's
overnight arrest

05:12.723 --> 05:15.073
for attempted assault
with a deadly weapon.

05:15.203 --> 05:16.683
Your Honor, may I speak?

05:16.814 --> 05:18.468
I'd let your counsel lead.

05:18.598 --> 05:21.558
Oh, no. If-if my client wants
to say something,

05:21.688 --> 05:23.342
that's-that's fine with me.

05:24.604 --> 05:27.085
I went to PDtroniX
last night

05:27.215 --> 05:29.000
to get back
what was stolen from me.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.567
My work,

05:30.697 --> 05:32.743
my dignity and the proof

05:32.873 --> 05:35.397
that I designed
the Unexpected Flame app.

05:36.529 --> 05:37.574
The defendant

05:37.704 --> 05:39.532
knows every accusation
made against me

05:39.663 --> 05:41.839
is a coverup
for when they go public.

05:41.969 --> 05:43.449
And the reason
I brought a knife

05:43.580 --> 05:45.712
last night was because
I feared for my safety.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.975
Plaintiff is amending
its complaint

05:48.106 --> 05:49.977
to include corporate theft
of intellectual property

05:50.108 --> 05:51.631
and stock options.

05:51.762 --> 05:54.112
Oh, we're also
amending our numbers.

05:54.242 --> 05:56.549
Uh, just had it.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.464
Here. Um...

05:58.595 --> 06:01.032
That's... that's you.

06:01.162 --> 06:02.599
- Here.
- Thank you.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.993
Jane Lin is now
suing PDtroniX

06:06.124 --> 06:08.735
for $360 million.

06:19.066 --> 06:20.459
She seemed totally honest.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.503
I mean, that speech was... Was very compelling.

06:21.634 --> 06:23.288
She could be
telling the truth.

06:23.418 --> 06:25.377
I mean, I'd buy it.
I bought it.

06:25.507 --> 06:28.206
Or she was coached
by Gus the shark,

06:28.336 --> 06:32.253
and that whole "PDtroniX
stole my app" story was a ploy.

06:32.384 --> 06:33.689
That Gus Easton
is very sneaky.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.040
Wasn't he that guy in the
Northbrook Aerospace case

06:36.170 --> 06:37.954
from a few months back?

06:38.085 --> 06:39.652
He's all mouth
and no pants.

06:39.782 --> 06:42.002
I don't even know what
he's doing on this case.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.918
But what if that Jane
is telling the truth?

06:45.049 --> 06:47.703
Didn't you tell me once that
if a woman in a workplace says

06:47.834 --> 06:49.792
her ideas have been stolen,
you should listen to her?

06:49.923 --> 06:54.536
I did, but we don't know enough
about her yet, or this case.

06:56.538 --> 06:59.324
I need you to approach her
off the record,

06:59.454 --> 07:01.282
as you do,
and get some more information.

07:01.413 --> 07:04.459
Okay. So you're deploying me as
an agent of truth and freedom?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.245
Chaos, more like.
I need you to tread lightly

07:07.375 --> 07:08.898
and be quiet about it.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.640
And for God's sake,
don't compromise our client.

07:11.771 --> 07:13.686
Okay, I will be discreet and
I will compromise nothing.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.298
I'm deploying Lyle as well.

07:18.430 --> 07:19.779
So you don't trust me?

07:23.435 --> 07:24.436
We didn't start
developing the app

07:24.566 --> 07:25.959
until after Jane was gone.

07:26.090 --> 07:28.004
But you did dump her

07:28.135 --> 07:30.006
and strip her
of her cofounder status

07:30.137 --> 07:32.052
moments before
you were about to go public.

07:32.183 --> 07:33.358
That was the board's decision.

07:33.488 --> 07:34.750
They thought
she was a liability,

07:34.881 --> 07:36.970
and voted four to one
to let her go.

07:37.101 --> 07:38.363
- Who was the holdout?
- Me.

07:38.493 --> 07:40.278
We were best friends.

07:40.408 --> 07:41.888
I thought
she'd pull it together.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.195
I got voted down.

07:44.325 --> 07:46.675
And we don't have $360 million.

07:46.806 --> 07:48.286
Oh, that's just
an inflated number

07:48.416 --> 07:49.896
that attorneys use to scare you.

07:50.026 --> 07:53.595
No, our public offering
is valued at $2 billion.

07:53.726 --> 07:54.553
If she wins,

07:54.683 --> 07:57.251
her share would be $360 million.

07:57.382 --> 07:58.426
So the shark did his homework.

07:58.557 --> 08:00.124
If the public thinks

08:00.254 --> 08:01.995
Jane's telling the truth,
they'll delete our apps,

08:02.126 --> 08:03.997
VCs won't back us,
we'll go under.

08:04.128 --> 08:06.913
Okay,
I need a bulletproof timeline

08:07.043 --> 08:09.350
of the creation of the app
and anything that you have

08:09.481 --> 08:12.571
that says Jane undermined
your ability to do your work.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.485
Okay?

08:14.573 --> 08:16.705
I am sorry
about your friendship,

08:16.836 --> 08:19.230
but I think we can still
rescue your company.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.535
Thank you.

08:24.931 --> 08:27.107
Thank you.

08:27.238 --> 08:28.761
Oh. Oh, sorry.

08:28.891 --> 08:30.719
Oh. Here. Ah.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.982
Can I have a rag
- or something, please?
- Yeah.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.810
Here you go.
Thank you.

08:34.941 --> 08:38.771
Ugh. That thing's
following me around.

08:38.901 --> 08:40.338
Why? Did you have a bad
experience on it or something?

08:40.468 --> 08:41.817
You could say that.

08:41.948 --> 08:43.906
I created that app.

08:44.037 --> 08:45.517
Oh, wow. Seriously?

08:45.647 --> 08:47.954
Here, let me buy you
another coffee.

08:48.084 --> 08:49.782
Can-can I have one more of
whatever she was having, please?

08:49.912 --> 08:53.177
- Sorry. Sorry. I'm Kevin.
- Jane.

08:53.307 --> 08:55.527
- Good to meet you.
- Hi.

08:55.657 --> 08:57.572
So, you, like,
<i>created</i> created it?

08:57.703 --> 08:59.139
- The whole app?
- Yeah.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.533
How does that even work?

09:01.663 --> 09:03.491
Okay, see, it's...

09:03.622 --> 09:05.232
it's different
from other dating apps.

09:05.363 --> 09:06.799
Usually you can say,

09:06.929 --> 09:08.931
"I want someone this height
or this religion.

09:09.062 --> 09:12.805
Um, a dog person, not
a dog person," stuff like that.

09:12.935 --> 09:14.067
But this one won't let you
set any preferences.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.156
Not sexual, not gender.

09:16.287 --> 09:18.289
Instead, it asks questions.

09:18.419 --> 09:21.335
- Do you like horror movies?
- Ah.

09:21.466 --> 09:23.381
More peanut butter
or more jelly.

09:23.511 --> 09:25.383
Peanut butter.
Uh, and this is supposed

09:25.513 --> 09:26.906
to help you find someone...

09:27.036 --> 09:29.387
You might not otherwise
connect with, yes.

09:29.517 --> 09:31.345
It's unexpected.

09:31.476 --> 09:34.000
I-I created a profile for you so
you can research how it works.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.436
Oh. Okay.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.438
Or if you just want to

09:37.569 --> 09:39.614
- look around.
- What?

09:39.745 --> 09:41.007
- Dating?
- Why not?

09:41.137 --> 09:42.791
Me? Francey, no.

09:42.922 --> 09:45.446
I'm married.
I'm-I'm... I'm still married.

09:45.577 --> 09:47.970
What? Are you saying
I should be dating now?

09:49.711 --> 09:52.148
And that Harry's never
coming back?

09:52.279 --> 09:54.368
Do you want him to come back?

09:58.242 --> 09:59.460
Um...

09:59.591 --> 10:01.636
I met my first husband
in college,

10:01.767 --> 10:03.638
and I met Harry through friends.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.597
And this is what
people do now? They just

10:05.727 --> 10:08.600
wipe, wipe, wipe. I mean...
Oh, my God.

10:08.730 --> 10:11.211
- What?
- Oh, Lord. Oh, my.

10:11.342 --> 10:15.215
Is that Gus, the corduroy pants
guy from the aerospace trial?

10:15.346 --> 10:18.131
Gus Easton from Seattle.

10:18.262 --> 10:19.306
He looks good.

10:19.437 --> 10:21.221
Francey!

10:21.352 --> 10:23.049
- Just saying.
- Look at that photo!

10:23.179 --> 10:25.747
This is how he presents himself
to the world.

10:25.878 --> 10:28.010
In that wrinkled shirt.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.099
There is a stain
on his jacket,

10:30.230 --> 10:31.623
right there.

10:31.753 --> 10:32.841
Wait. Did I match it?
Did I match it?

10:32.972 --> 10:34.756
No, no, no, no.

10:34.887 --> 10:36.192
Don't worry. No, no, no.
You have to hit this button

10:36.323 --> 10:37.542
- right here.
- Okay, no!

10:37.672 --> 10:40.414
Don't. Just...

10:40.545 --> 10:43.112
don't. No dating, no dating.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.158
Go on, go back to work.

10:45.289 --> 10:47.116
- No dating.
- No dating.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.030
What about you?

10:48.161 --> 10:49.989
Worst dating experience.

10:50.119 --> 10:52.818
Huh. Uh... well,

10:52.948 --> 10:57.692
I dated this woman
a few years ago.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.303
Uh, we went
into business together,

10:59.433 --> 11:03.568
and... I nearly went to jail
for her crimes.

11:03.698 --> 11:05.526
- Ooh.
- Yeah, bad.

11:05.657 --> 11:07.398
Lost my license and everything.

11:07.528 --> 11:09.313
License for what?

11:09.443 --> 11:11.532
Oh.

11:11.663 --> 11:13.839
Cosmetology.

11:13.969 --> 11:15.754
Hair, skin, nails,
you know, whatever.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.625
Well, the last person

11:17.756 --> 11:19.105
I was involved with was
a vindictive jerk

11:19.235 --> 11:22.151
at the company
that stole my app.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.719
Can you prove
that they stole it?

11:24.850 --> 11:28.114
I pitched a dating app
two years ago

11:28.244 --> 11:30.029
and got shouted down.

11:30.159 --> 11:33.641
So, when I renewed my contract,
I carved out the idea.

11:33.772 --> 11:37.341
I only worked on it at home,
never mentioned it to anyone.

11:37.471 --> 11:39.125
I remember the exact day

11:39.255 --> 11:42.433
I broke the code
because it was my birthday.

11:42.563 --> 11:45.000
March 12 last year.

11:45.131 --> 11:48.787
Everything was fine till
that bastard Mason showed up.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.136
Mason?

11:50.266 --> 11:53.661
The head of digital
marketing and PR.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.317
Oh, I got to go.

11:57.448 --> 11:59.972
Nice meeting you, Kevin.

12:00.102 --> 12:02.801
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Oh, sure.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.151
And good luck
with the cosmetology.

12:05.281 --> 12:07.936
Oh, yeah. Pedicure exams
coming up next week.

12:10.722 --> 12:13.028
Mason, huh?

12:13.159 --> 12:15.466
<i>Are you sure I'm not on there?</i>

12:15.596 --> 12:17.424
I don't have a Johan listed.

12:17.555 --> 12:18.947
Really? Johan Beckler?

12:19.078 --> 12:20.688
Interviewing for
a position here?

12:20.819 --> 12:22.690
I.T. or design?

12:22.821 --> 12:25.127
Uh, I do both, so, uh,
I'm meeting Mason.

12:25.258 --> 12:26.215
Native or PWA?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.261
Well, I'm from here,
so native.

12:29.523 --> 12:31.395
Are you, like, the
pre-interviewer or something?

12:31.525 --> 12:33.222
I'm the person who
fends off folks

12:33.353 --> 12:35.616
who have no tech background,

12:35.747 --> 12:37.531
show up with no plan,
or want to spy on us

12:37.662 --> 12:39.881
from other companies.

12:40.012 --> 12:41.274
Oh, great. Um...
Come on, everybody,

12:41.405 --> 12:42.188
you're gonna miss it.

12:42.318 --> 12:43.885
Aah!
Yeah.

12:44.016 --> 12:46.061
Oh, you know what,
he's at the party.

12:46.192 --> 12:48.107
I forgot. That was
in the email.

12:48.237 --> 12:49.717
Why don't I just
wait here for Mason?

12:49.848 --> 12:52.111
Why don't you come back
when you have

12:52.241 --> 12:53.808
an actual appointment?

12:53.939 --> 12:56.855
Or a much better story.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.117
Uh, you bet.

12:58.247 --> 13:00.859
But bathroom first?

13:00.989 --> 13:02.817
- I think I might throw up.
- Gross.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.211
Yeah, I'm just sensitive
to patterns.

13:05.341 --> 13:07.953
Especially when someone's
wearing all of them.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.911
Thank you.

13:23.185 --> 13:25.231
We're almost there. Just a few
more and we'll hit a million.

13:25.361 --> 13:26.493
Yes!

13:26.624 --> 13:27.886
That's it!
We did it.

13:32.194 --> 13:34.545
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

13:34.675 --> 13:36.895
- Speech! Speech! Speech!
- Well, that's why you hire

13:37.025 --> 13:39.288
a head of digital marketing
and PR.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.334
Mason! Mason!

13:41.465 --> 13:44.685
Mason! Mason! Mason!

13:44.816 --> 13:46.252
- Mason! Mason!
- I can do it. I can do it.

13:46.382 --> 13:47.645
Mason!

13:49.211 --> 13:52.737
One million users
in under six months.

13:55.740 --> 13:59.439
Premium conversions up 36%.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.269
And the beta for our
next big disrupter

14:03.399 --> 14:05.184
FamOnTheWall--

14:05.314 --> 14:07.099
the secure way families
and partners

14:07.229 --> 14:10.015
can track each other 24-7
and keep everyone safe--

14:10.145 --> 14:13.845
has been downloaded
by every single employee!

14:16.412 --> 14:18.066
Next big deal!

14:18.197 --> 14:20.504
Next big deal!
Next big deal!

14:24.464 --> 14:26.292
Next big deal!

15:29.311 --> 15:31.444
Uh, could you actually
get that door for me?

15:31.575 --> 15:33.011
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

15:46.241 --> 15:48.548
Hey I, uh, got another one
for you, man.

15:48.679 --> 15:49.767
Oh, yeah.

15:51.377 --> 15:52.073
Sure.

15:52.204 --> 15:54.467
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

15:54.598 --> 15:57.296
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.127
Now let me get this straight.

16:02.257 --> 16:04.520
You went to our client's office.

16:04.651 --> 16:06.392
Jane told me about this guy
at the company...

16:06.522 --> 16:08.089
- Mason.
- Right.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.961
Who left his own party
to shred documents

16:10.091 --> 16:12.572
the day their motion
to dismiss was denied.

16:12.703 --> 16:15.183
Why else if not to cover
PDtroniX's tracks?

16:15.314 --> 16:18.883
What if Jane was right and
they did steal her app?

16:19.013 --> 16:20.145
- She's not our client.
- Okay.

16:20.275 --> 16:22.626
So what if our client
harmed her? What then?

16:22.756 --> 16:25.454
Then she's still not our client.

16:25.585 --> 16:29.720
And my duty is to zealously
represent my client

16:29.850 --> 16:31.504
- no matter what.
- No matter what.

16:31.635 --> 16:35.160
But we do need to make sure
our case is airtight,

16:35.290 --> 16:39.338
so maybe you should continue
to look into things.

16:39.468 --> 16:42.428
Because if she is sane
and they did manufacture

16:42.558 --> 16:44.299
this bad behavior, then... Right.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.214
I've got something.
Just AirDropped it to you.

16:46.345 --> 16:47.868
- Do I need to hit a button?
- No, it's already on there.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.175
Oh. Impressive.

16:50.305 --> 16:51.829
I tracked Jane,
like you asked,

16:51.959 --> 16:53.569
and I shot this
outside Graham's house

16:53.700 --> 16:55.310
- an hour ago.
- What?

16:57.138 --> 16:58.531
You know PDtroniX

16:58.662 --> 17:00.794
stole my computer code!

17:00.925 --> 17:02.753
Now you'll be sorry...

17:02.883 --> 17:04.450
Well, she's drunk.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.626
Not drunk, she's upset.

17:06.757 --> 17:07.932
She's more than upset.
That's a little...

17:08.062 --> 17:09.760
You coward...!

17:09.890 --> 17:13.024
It goes on like this
- for five more minutes.
- Okay.

17:13.154 --> 17:14.068
Do you have
to take this to court?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.461
And then PDtroniX
will win,

17:15.591 --> 17:17.550
launch their new Big
Brother app, and...

17:17.681 --> 17:19.813
And we put our case to bed.

17:19.944 --> 17:22.207
This is hard evidence

17:22.337 --> 17:24.992
that she's unstable
and was fired for cause.

17:25.950 --> 17:29.257
Our side is justified.
The case is over.

17:29.388 --> 17:31.129
Thank you, Lyle.
Good work.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.218
And now

17:33.348 --> 17:37.178
I can delete this
ridiculous app from my phone.

17:37.309 --> 17:40.878
Where is the delete button?
Hold on.

17:41.008 --> 17:42.444
Oh, my gosh.

17:42.575 --> 17:45.186
Todd, is this Allison?

17:45.317 --> 17:46.753
- What?
- Is that your sister?

17:46.884 --> 17:48.929
On a dating app?

17:53.733 --> 17:55.474
Does Allison really
like rock climbing?

17:55.604 --> 17:56.692
And origami? That doesn't
sound like her, does it?

17:56.823 --> 17:58.477
And this name Claire.

17:58.607 --> 18:00.043
Allison would never
go by Claire.

18:00.174 --> 18:02.176
Although that does look
like my red striped sweater

18:02.307 --> 18:04.047
- she borrowed and never returned.
- Yeah.

18:04.178 --> 18:05.484
Look, that little
hole right there.
Mm-hmm.

18:05.614 --> 18:06.006
Well, at least
she didn't check

18:06.136 --> 18:07.921
"looking for NSA fun."

18:08.051 --> 18:10.532
What does National Security
Agency have to do with it?

18:10.663 --> 18:13.448
Mom, "no strings
attached." NSA.

18:13.579 --> 18:15.624
Are you NSA?
Well, yes.

18:15.755 --> 18:17.147
I've done "no strings
attached" before, yeah.

18:17.278 --> 18:18.627
Wait, was Veronica NSA?

18:18.758 --> 18:19.759
No, there were plenty
of strings there.

18:19.889 --> 18:21.848
Is Lawrence NSA?Mom, Lawrence is married.

18:21.978 --> 18:23.980
- Well, so is she.
- Okay, do you remember Becca?

18:24.111 --> 18:25.591
No.
Exactly, 'cause there were
no strings attached.

18:25.721 --> 18:27.201
Okay, it's time to
close this app.

18:27.332 --> 18:29.551
Okay, but, but,
Todd, do you think

18:29.682 --> 18:32.511
Allison is that unhappy
in her marriage?

18:32.641 --> 18:34.208
I don't know.
I thought they were fine.

18:34.339 --> 18:36.210
Well, find out.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.256
Go to her house...
And what?

18:38.386 --> 18:40.301
I'm barred from
going in, remember?

18:40.432 --> 18:42.434
Well, go find evidence, proof.

18:42.564 --> 18:44.610
Find that sweater.
This is your sister's marriage.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.829
Exactly. Not yours
to meddle in.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.266
It's not meddling.

18:48.396 --> 18:50.442
I'm her mother.
This is what mothers do.

18:50.572 --> 18:52.531
What, they invade
their children's privacy

18:52.661 --> 18:54.794
and don't trust them
to run their own lives?

18:54.924 --> 18:56.186
Wait, ah, ah.

18:56.317 --> 18:58.232
I am going inside,
and since you are now

18:58.363 --> 18:59.189
Kevin the cosmetologist,

18:59.320 --> 19:00.930
you may not join.

19:01.061 --> 19:03.281
I want you to go find out
about this Allison issue.

19:03.411 --> 19:05.544
Go on. Go, go, go. Now. Go.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.069
Come out!

19:09.199 --> 19:11.898
Worst best friend ever!

19:12.028 --> 19:15.641
Don't make me
come after you again.

19:15.771 --> 19:19.993
'Cause I'll keep coming
until you tell the truth!

19:20.123 --> 19:21.516
Your Honor,

19:21.647 --> 19:24.302
defense's new evidence shows
that this case

19:24.432 --> 19:26.826
is a desperate attempt
by the plaintiff

19:26.956 --> 19:30.046
to wring my client dry for money
that she isn't due.

19:30.177 --> 19:31.047
Counselor?

19:31.178 --> 19:32.745
Uh, yes.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.834
Plaintiff is amending
our complaint.

19:35.878 --> 19:39.621
Yeah, again. Uh, affidavits from
the phone company certifying

19:39.752 --> 19:41.841
texts from PDtroniX's
head of digital marketing

19:41.971 --> 19:44.322
Mason Keen to Jane Lin
after she ended their

19:44.452 --> 19:45.584
romantic relationship.

19:45.714 --> 19:49.065
The texts savagely harass
Ms. Lin--

19:49.196 --> 19:51.764
132 texts in all--

19:51.894 --> 19:54.332
trying to force my client
to quit, and creating

19:54.462 --> 19:56.856
a hostile work environment.

19:56.986 --> 20:00.642
Uh, copies of...

20:00.773 --> 20:03.166
Yes. Right here.

20:03.297 --> 20:05.038
Uh... here you go.

20:05.168 --> 20:07.083
Yeah, thank you.

20:07.214 --> 20:08.346
Oh. Oh!

20:08.476 --> 20:09.651
Oh?

20:09.782 --> 20:11.740
Your Honor, if I don't
eat right now,

20:11.871 --> 20:13.481
I don't get any food
for another five hours.

20:14.656 --> 20:16.789
- Bon appétit.
- Yes.

20:18.530 --> 20:21.097
My client knew
about the relationship

20:21.228 --> 20:22.534
between Jane and Mason,

20:22.664 --> 20:24.144
but he didn't know
about the texts.

20:24.274 --> 20:25.406
Bull.

20:25.537 --> 20:28.278
Jane asked Graham for help.

20:28.409 --> 20:30.933
Well, she didn't
disclose the texts.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.066
She only said the
relationship went south.

20:33.196 --> 20:34.415
Went sou...

20:34.546 --> 20:36.243
Did you read those texts?

20:36.374 --> 20:37.592
He tried to crush her.

20:37.723 --> 20:40.595
You are crabby
when you don't eat.

20:41.727 --> 20:43.555
I'll be better
after I digest.

20:43.685 --> 20:46.906
All right, admit you lost
the harassment

20:47.036 --> 20:48.908
and the wrongful termination
parts of the case.

20:49.038 --> 20:52.346
Only if you admit you have
no proof the app was stolen.

20:54.304 --> 20:55.567
I'm pretty good at fighting.

20:55.697 --> 20:57.046
I don't run out of energy.

20:57.177 --> 20:58.483
Oh, I know.

20:58.613 --> 21:00.572
I've seen all
the amended complaints.

21:00.702 --> 21:02.312
You sure you want to keep going?

21:02.443 --> 21:04.271
I have stamina of my own.

21:04.402 --> 21:06.229
Ever been on a dating app?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.970
What? No.

21:08.101 --> 21:12.627
I am a married woman.
I-I am wearing a wedding ring.

21:15.195 --> 21:16.326
People break up,

21:16.457 --> 21:19.199
get dumped,
they do crazy things.

21:19.329 --> 21:21.723
Lie, cheat and steal.

21:21.854 --> 21:24.465
Cover up for people who
lie, cheat and steal.

21:26.206 --> 21:29.427
I'd keep looking into
your client, if I were you.

21:33.648 --> 21:38.218
Oh... you forgot
your muffin.

21:50.665 --> 21:52.841
What did you find out
about Allison?

21:52.972 --> 21:54.408
Nothing.

21:55.365 --> 21:57.542
I am not going to break
into someone's house

21:57.672 --> 21:59.544
after I was told
not to go inside.

21:59.674 --> 22:01.676
Trust needs to be earned, remember?

22:01.807 --> 22:04.853
- Fine, I'll do it myself.
- What?

22:04.984 --> 22:07.987
No, Mom, you are terrible
at covert operations.

22:08.117 --> 22:09.684
Mom! Seriously?

22:09.815 --> 22:13.862
Mom. Mom.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.837
Okay, it's my red
striped sweater.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.970
And if we find it here,
we will know that

22:35.101 --> 22:37.538
that was Allison
on the dating profile.

22:37.669 --> 22:39.018
I don't know why
you're whispering.

22:39.148 --> 22:40.585
Nobody's home.

22:40.715 --> 22:41.977
What are you doing?

22:42.108 --> 22:44.284
Allison?

22:45.285 --> 22:46.460
Is she here?

22:46.591 --> 22:47.461
Yeah, hi, Todd.

22:47.592 --> 22:50.246
I have a security system.

22:50.377 --> 22:51.421
What are you doing in my house?

22:51.552 --> 22:52.814
Uh, can you see me?

22:52.945 --> 22:54.990
No. You tripped
the motion sensors.

22:55.121 --> 22:56.035
And who else would
let themselves into my house

22:56.165 --> 22:57.602
with a key?

22:57.732 --> 23:00.605
Uh, well, uh, I have a reason.

23:00.735 --> 23:03.042
- Okay.
- There's a-a leak.

23:03.172 --> 23:06.045
There's a little bit of a drip
coming from the ceiling.

23:06.175 --> 23:07.394
It's a little quiet.
You have to listen carefully.

23:07.525 --> 23:08.090
Can you hear that?

23:08.221 --> 23:09.309
No.

23:09.439 --> 23:11.398
Okay, well, there's...

23:11.529 --> 23:12.442
Now can you hear it?

23:12.573 --> 23:13.922
No. Still no.

23:14.053 --> 23:15.707
Okay, well, it was really loud yesterday.

23:15.837 --> 23:17.056
I don't know what to tell you.

23:17.186 --> 23:18.405
Oh, my gosh.

23:18.536 --> 23:20.015
Is this her new backsplash?

23:20.146 --> 23:21.451
It's dreadful.

23:21.582 --> 23:23.889
Um, is that Mom?
Is Mom there with you?

23:24.019 --> 23:25.978
No, no, Mom is
definitely not here.

23:26.108 --> 23:29.416
I specifically told her
not White Sand

23:29.547 --> 23:31.157
but Scottish Mist.

23:31.287 --> 23:32.550
This is heinous.

23:32.680 --> 23:33.725
Todd, what is going on?

23:33.855 --> 23:35.248
Well, actually, you know what,

23:35.378 --> 23:37.206
I think the leak is upstairs.

23:37.337 --> 23:40.122
The bathroom near the closet,
where all the clothes are.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.081
- Can you check for me, please?
- Yeah.

23:42.211 --> 23:43.343
Checking.

23:43.473 --> 23:45.084
Okay, so we checked
their bedroom.

23:45.214 --> 23:46.433
This is the last room
- in the house.
- Okay.

23:46.564 --> 23:49.262
Al, you still with me?

23:49.392 --> 23:51.351
I'm at the beach, but, yeah,
I'm still talking to you, Todd.

23:51.481 --> 23:53.832
Sorry.

23:53.962 --> 23:56.530
Um, is there water
on the floor?

23:56.661 --> 23:57.966
What are you seeing?

23:58.097 --> 24:00.229
Uh, you know what,
it's not so much seeing,

24:00.360 --> 24:02.362
it's more hearing,
but I-I think that

24:02.492 --> 24:04.277
the drip has stopped.

24:04.407 --> 24:07.280
Yeah. I'm not hearing anything.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.026
I couldn't hold it.

24:14.156 --> 24:15.288
Oh, my goodness,

24:15.418 --> 24:17.290
what is the plan
for all these pillows?

24:17.420 --> 24:19.031
They don't match at all.

24:19.161 --> 24:21.076
I swear I can hear
- Mom's voice.
- You know what,

24:21.207 --> 24:24.079
my shoes are a little squeaky--
they're new.

24:24.210 --> 24:27.256
But, Al, I actually think
that the leak has stopped.

24:27.387 --> 24:30.477
I think, uh, yeah,
I think that we're...

24:30.608 --> 24:32.784
- all good.
- My goodness,

24:32.914 --> 24:34.307
this doesn't go here.

24:34.437 --> 24:36.439
This is all feng shui...

24:36.570 --> 24:38.224
Okay.

24:38.354 --> 24:42.532
This has to move here,
like so.

24:42.663 --> 24:45.013
Can you just call a plumber?

24:45.144 --> 24:47.712
You know what,
I'll call a plumber right away,

24:47.842 --> 24:49.757
just to be safe, but, uh,

24:49.888 --> 24:52.891
yeah, I-I-I think we're good.

24:53.021 --> 24:55.284
You just go back
to your vacation, okay?

24:55.415 --> 24:58.200
I am leaving.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.550
I'm leaving.

25:01.813 --> 25:03.423
<i>What are you doing in my office?</i>

25:05.512 --> 25:06.382
What are you,
some kind of...

25:06.513 --> 25:08.297
Savant?...freak?

25:08.428 --> 25:09.472
How'd you do this?

25:09.603 --> 25:11.997
Well, I walked
past your office

25:12.127 --> 25:13.476
and couldn't resist a puzzle.

25:13.607 --> 25:17.089
But maybe I found something.

25:17.219 --> 25:18.394
It's computer code,
with a key algorithm.

25:18.525 --> 25:20.396
And a date stamp
of March 12th.

25:20.527 --> 25:22.050
That's Jane's birthday.

25:22.181 --> 25:24.226
Wait, this could be
her breakthrough code.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.575
But how did it get from
her private computer

25:25.706 --> 25:27.055
to PDtroniX's shredder?

25:27.186 --> 25:29.623
Wait, everyone's watching
everyone all the time.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.451
Especially a tech company

25:31.581 --> 25:34.672
that's developing a new app that
connects their employees 24-7.

25:34.802 --> 25:36.935
It's called FamOnTheWall.

25:37.065 --> 25:39.415
It's one of those
inner circle things

25:39.546 --> 25:40.808
that tracks location.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.723
You know, some can
monitor keystrokes,

25:42.854 --> 25:44.856
texts, videos, and maybe even

25:44.986 --> 25:46.248
- steal their documents.
- Steal their documents.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.077
If Jane was there when
FamOnTheWall went into beta,

25:49.208 --> 25:50.426
she would have put it
on her devices, too.

25:50.557 --> 25:52.646
Right.
Which means

25:52.777 --> 25:54.039
anyone at PDtroniX,
including Mason,

25:54.169 --> 25:56.041
could have accessed her code.

25:56.171 --> 25:58.086
We got to go talk
- to my mom.
- Go talk to your mom.

25:58.217 --> 25:59.871
Mom, breakthrough.

26:00.001 --> 26:01.960
Okay, Jane created
her big code

26:02.090 --> 26:03.222
the night of her birthday.

26:03.352 --> 26:04.658
March 12, 2021.

26:04.789 --> 26:07.182
Mason Keen shredded
computer code dated...

26:07.313 --> 26:08.401
March 12, 2021.

26:08.531 --> 26:09.532
Did you really just
bring me in here

26:09.663 --> 26:10.882
to repeat "March 12, 2021"?

26:11.012 --> 26:13.667
And PDtroniX has
a new app in development

26:13.798 --> 26:15.843
that every employee
has signed up for,

26:15.974 --> 26:17.540
which might be spying
on their work.

26:17.671 --> 26:19.760
We need to go to the judge
and get a warrant for

26:19.891 --> 26:21.240
all of Mason Keen's devices.

26:21.370 --> 26:23.372
Intriguing, yes.

26:23.503 --> 26:25.984
But I can't get a warrant
against my own client.

26:26.114 --> 26:29.291
Oh, come on, we all know
who the villain in this case is.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.684
Aren't defense attorneys
supposed to fight

26:30.815 --> 26:31.946
for the little guy?

26:32.077 --> 26:33.774
We're not gonna
let her lose, are we?

26:33.905 --> 26:35.384
Todd, PDtroniX is my client.

26:35.515 --> 26:37.299
I am bound by the rules
of professional conduct.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.084
My hands are tied.

26:39.214 --> 26:40.825
Margaret, you're gonna
want to see this.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.523
Just got an email
from Graham

26:43.653 --> 26:46.526
with a video
from Jane attached.

26:48.180 --> 26:51.313
I know PDtroniX
didn't steal my code.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.228
What?

26:53.359 --> 26:55.361
I didn't create the
Unexpected Flame app.

26:55.491 --> 26:58.799
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused, Graham.

26:58.930 --> 27:00.366
It's all yours.

27:00.496 --> 27:03.151
Did she just apologize?

27:03.282 --> 27:04.805
Throw the case?

27:10.744 --> 27:12.354
So that's it?
It's over? We won?

27:12.485 --> 27:15.226
If you combine Jane's
breaking, entering,

27:15.357 --> 27:18.273
attempted assault charges,
and apology,

27:18.404 --> 27:20.144
Gus won't have a leg
to stand on.

27:20.275 --> 27:23.147
I really believed
Jane wrote that code.

27:23.278 --> 27:26.063
Well, then why would she
apologize if she did?

27:26.194 --> 27:28.457
I don't know.

27:30.111 --> 27:33.027
Why don't I call Gus,
tell him we'll settle

27:33.157 --> 27:35.725
on the harassment
and wrongful termination,

27:35.856 --> 27:39.120
then maybe I can get Graham
to withdraw

27:39.250 --> 27:40.774
the non-compete.

27:40.904 --> 27:43.124
So she'll at least be able
to keep working?

27:43.254 --> 27:45.692
Eh, she can bounce back
from disaster.

27:45.822 --> 27:47.346
I know someone else who did.

27:57.660 --> 27:58.400
Gus.

27:58.531 --> 27:59.793
Jane's parking.

27:59.923 --> 28:01.142
Graham, too.

28:01.272 --> 28:03.797
I thought this room
was empty.

28:03.927 --> 28:05.320
Why aren't you...?In reception?

28:05.451 --> 28:07.583
Waiting among all your
expensive furniture

28:07.714 --> 28:09.890
and Christmas candy,
trying to throw me off?

28:10.020 --> 28:12.109
I asked them to put me
in here instead.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.024
- Trying to throw me off.
- Is it working?

28:14.155 --> 28:16.853
How did you get involved
with this case?

28:16.984 --> 28:19.900
When I joined,
Jane was acting pro se.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.903
Well, I got onto
this dating app,

28:23.033 --> 28:24.905
first one since my divorce.

28:25.035 --> 28:26.559
I, you know, I liked
the idea that you could...

28:27.821 --> 28:29.431
...be surprised by somebody.

28:30.693 --> 28:34.480
Anyway, um, I looked up the app
and saw the lawsuit. You?

28:34.610 --> 28:37.657
Um, one of our partners
broke his leg.

28:37.787 --> 28:39.833
No, I meant Unexpected Flame.

28:39.963 --> 28:42.531
Seeing you on there
was quite a surprise,

28:42.662 --> 28:44.185
especially with
that wedding band.

28:45.665 --> 28:48.798
So, you married or dating?
Or both?

28:48.929 --> 28:51.453
Well, I...

28:51.584 --> 28:53.194
I like peanut butter.

28:55.326 --> 28:57.328
Oh, sorry, I, um... Hi.

28:57.459 --> 28:58.417
Graham, come in.

28:58.547 --> 29:00.810
Come. Sit. Thank you.

29:00.941 --> 29:02.072
All right. Sit down.

29:07.948 --> 29:09.079
Kevin?

29:09.210 --> 29:10.472
Hmm?

29:10.603 --> 29:12.431
- What are you doing here?
- Oh...

29:12.561 --> 29:14.302
Do cosmetologists need lawyers?

29:14.433 --> 29:17.871
No, actually, uh,
my name isn't Kevin.

29:18.001 --> 29:20.700
It's Hector, and...

29:20.830 --> 29:23.267
No, my name is Todd Wright.

29:23.398 --> 29:24.747
My mother is Margaret Wright,

29:24.878 --> 29:25.966
and she's actually
a partner here.

29:26.096 --> 29:28.098
Wait, you're working
with PDtroniX.

29:28.229 --> 29:29.622
No, no, no, I...

29:30.623 --> 29:33.147
Yes. I just...

29:34.278 --> 29:35.671
I believed you.

29:35.802 --> 29:38.065
I believed that
you were wronged,

29:38.195 --> 29:39.936
and I was trying to help
from the inside,

29:40.067 --> 29:41.372
so I just have to ask,

29:41.503 --> 29:43.244
why did you make that video?

29:43.374 --> 29:45.725
- What are you talking about?
- The video that you made.

29:45.855 --> 29:46.943
Here.

29:47.074 --> 29:49.555
JANE [on video]:
I know PDtroniX

29:49.685 --> 29:52.209
didn't steal my code.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.124
Where are you going?
Wait, what about the meeting?

29:54.255 --> 29:55.952
I'm getting proof
of what's mine once and for all.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.085
Wait. No, no, no... Tell them to go to hell.

29:59.782 --> 30:02.611
Todd. What...

30:07.094 --> 30:08.791
Oh, if it isn't Johann.

30:08.922 --> 30:10.314
Oh, hey, hi.

30:10.445 --> 30:12.186
Uh, turns out I got
a callback interview.

30:12.316 --> 30:14.493
- Did you, now?
- Yeah. So I'm just
gonna need you

30:14.623 --> 30:15.711
to let me back there
to see Mason.

30:15.842 --> 30:17.974
Oh, Mason, who's been suspended?

30:18.105 --> 30:19.759
Of course, right.

30:19.889 --> 30:22.022
So, uh, my interview must
be someone else named...

30:22.152 --> 30:23.719
- Security.
- No, no, no, that's not
the name I was thinking.

30:23.850 --> 30:25.547
I am calling... Security.

30:25.678 --> 30:26.809
Uh, Jane, wait,
no, no, no, no, no.

30:26.940 --> 30:27.897
Get out of the way.

30:28.028 --> 30:29.203
Wait, why would you come here

30:29.333 --> 30:30.465
and break your
restraining order?

30:30.596 --> 30:31.988
Risk everything
after you apologized?

30:32.119 --> 30:34.730
I didn't apologize.
I didn't make that video.

30:34.861 --> 30:35.731
You tell those traitors...

30:35.862 --> 30:37.167
It's a fake?

30:37.298 --> 30:39.518
The apology video is
a deepfake. I'll fix this.

30:39.648 --> 30:40.736
I will.

30:46.671 --> 30:47.759
I didn't create
the Unexpected Flame app.

30:47.890 --> 30:49.326
I'm sorry for all
the trouble I've caused, Graham.

30:49.457 --> 30:52.503
Jane didn't make that video.
It's a deepfake.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.679
Look, PDtroniX is
a tech company,

30:54.810 --> 30:58.205
so somebody there took
video footage of Jane

30:58.335 --> 30:59.945
and married it to her voice

31:00.076 --> 31:01.817
to make a fake apology. Here.

31:01.947 --> 31:05.038
PDtroniX stole my computer code!

31:05.168 --> 31:09.912
Now you'll be sorry for
all the trouble you caused!

31:10.043 --> 31:13.089
She's using the same words
- she used in the apology video.
- Exactly.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.613
- Except her voice is different.
- Voice-alteration
technology, Mom.

31:15.744 --> 31:17.267
And she was calm
in the apology video.

31:17.398 --> 31:19.617
Yes, but she's one
of the founders.

31:19.748 --> 31:21.750
So they must have just taken
some old, boring corporate video

31:21.880 --> 31:23.752
they had on file,

31:23.882 --> 31:26.624
and the one person who has
access to every digital file...

31:26.755 --> 31:28.017
Is Mason.

31:28.148 --> 31:29.540
But in order to confirm that,

31:29.671 --> 31:31.368
we need a warrant
for his devices.

31:31.499 --> 31:32.978
Right, which is working
against our client,

31:33.109 --> 31:35.633
and we have to play
by the rules, I know, I know.

31:35.764 --> 31:39.594
Not necessarily so.

31:40.508 --> 31:42.901
If Mason really was
the only one behind this,

31:43.032 --> 31:46.601
there is a way that everyone
- can win, and Jane, too.
- Okay.

31:46.731 --> 31:49.691
I just need to-- Uh, there's
something I have to...

31:49.821 --> 31:51.519
I just need to...
How are we going to...?

31:51.649 --> 31:53.390
Yes, we can do this.

31:53.521 --> 31:55.610
But I'm going to need your help.

31:57.351 --> 31:59.353
When somebody else
is speaking,

31:59.483 --> 32:01.268
get close to them
- for the mic.
- Okay.

32:01.398 --> 32:02.791
And, uh, we have
all the easy words.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.836
You just need to get
- the unique ones.
- Get the unique ones.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.100
- You got this, okay?
- Okay, I got it. Okay.

32:07.230 --> 32:07.926
- Let's go.
- You got it?

32:08.057 --> 32:09.363
- I got it.
- Okay, good.

32:10.581 --> 32:13.541
So, then you and Jane Lin
had a relationship,

32:13.671 --> 32:15.891
- which she broke off.
- Yeah.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.676
And after she broke it off,
you sent her

32:18.807 --> 32:21.505
132 harassing texts.

32:21.636 --> 32:22.941
I texted her.

32:23.072 --> 32:24.117
Did you want her fired?

32:24.247 --> 32:25.988
Yeah. And she went right out

32:26.119 --> 32:27.555
and proved she was crazy.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.732
Right?

32:30.862 --> 32:32.777
Well, she's not the one
who sent the texts

32:32.908 --> 32:34.779
and then organized
the whole company against her.

32:34.910 --> 32:38.043
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

32:38.174 --> 32:40.263
Withdrawn.
Your witness.

32:42.439 --> 32:43.875
Um...

32:44.006 --> 32:45.094
Audio works?
Audio works.

32:45.225 --> 32:46.922
I hear her.
We are a go.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.534
As head of digital marketing,

32:50.665 --> 32:53.320
you were in charge
of all digital content.

32:53.450 --> 32:55.844
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.368
Video.

32:59.152 --> 33:00.718
Did you say "video"?

33:00.849 --> 33:01.980
I didn't say "video."

33:02.111 --> 33:03.808
Ah. Yes.

33:03.939 --> 33:05.810
Yes, Mom.

33:05.941 --> 33:07.203
Yes, that's fine.

33:08.596 --> 33:09.814
Fam. Wall.

33:11.860 --> 33:16.386
Um, would you consider
the other members of your team

33:16.517 --> 33:19.041
like a big fam?
A fam?

33:19.172 --> 33:20.042
As if there were

33:20.173 --> 33:21.522
no walls among you?

33:21.652 --> 33:22.958
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.220
Would you answer

33:24.351 --> 33:25.787
in complete sentences, please?

33:25.917 --> 33:26.918
I don't know
why you're talking about walls.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.355
Wonderful.

33:29.443 --> 33:31.096
Bonus.

33:31.227 --> 33:32.141
Uh, it must have

33:32.272 --> 33:33.969
been a... a bonus,

33:34.099 --> 33:36.667
- having no walls?
- A bonus?

33:36.798 --> 33:38.278
Objection?

33:38.408 --> 33:41.759
Uh, for-- I-I don't
know-- weirdness?

33:41.890 --> 33:43.718
If Your Honor would
give me some leeway...

33:43.848 --> 33:44.719
Okay.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.637
Being accused of stealing
must have felt...

33:49.767 --> 33:51.726
- I didn't steal anything!
- From an ex-flame?

33:51.856 --> 33:53.293
She wasn't a flame.
She was a psycho.

33:54.729 --> 33:55.599
Unexpected.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.471
Was it...

33:57.601 --> 33:58.689
unexpected?

33:58.820 --> 34:00.952
- Again, complete sentences.
- Objection!

34:01.083 --> 34:02.737
What the hell is this?

34:02.867 --> 34:04.434
This whole thing
is unexpected.

34:06.654 --> 34:07.524
Got him!

34:09.047 --> 34:10.658
Your Honor,

34:10.788 --> 34:13.574
I would submit that the
plaintiff is fully justified

34:13.704 --> 34:16.751
in its accusations of my client
and its criminal behavior

34:16.881 --> 34:18.100
inside PDtroniX.

34:18.231 --> 34:21.973
And now we have proof.

34:22.104 --> 34:23.627
I know exactly what I'm doing.

34:23.758 --> 34:25.412
No, don't worry about it,
it's going to be fine.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.588
I'm just gonna get some water.

34:29.938 --> 34:31.461
If you move your finger... How soon?

34:31.592 --> 34:32.810
Really soon.
Uh, we'll text you.

34:32.941 --> 34:34.203
Hurry!

34:35.248 --> 34:36.597
<i>Ms. Wright,</i>

34:36.727 --> 34:38.207
you want to tell us
what that was?

34:38.338 --> 34:39.991
Your Honor, in-in m-matters

34:40.122 --> 34:42.690
of wrongful termination,
the plaintiff must prove

34:42.820 --> 34:44.300
that he or she was fired for...

34:44.431 --> 34:45.867
You did not do all this

34:45.997 --> 34:48.348
so that you can counsel me
on the law, right?

34:48.478 --> 34:50.350
No. Oh.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.221
I'd like to play a recording.

34:52.352 --> 34:54.789
Oh, come on. I object.

34:54.919 --> 34:57.052
If it proves defense has
something actually legal

34:57.182 --> 34:59.141
to do here?

34:59.272 --> 35:01.970
The voice you are about
to hear is that of Mason Keen.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.842
I used our FamOnTheWall app
to steal Jane's code

35:04.973 --> 35:07.367
for Unexpected Flame
and take the bonus.

35:07.497 --> 35:09.238
What? I didn't say that!

35:09.369 --> 35:11.632
Whatever that bitch is doing,
she deserved everything

35:11.762 --> 35:13.111
- that happened to her.
- All right, all right, all right.

35:13.242 --> 35:15.070
Happened to her. You mean after

35:15.200 --> 35:18.421
you harassed her and then used
FamOnTheWall to spy on her?

35:18.552 --> 35:19.944
Ms. Wright, you are

35:20.075 --> 35:22.251
wading dangerously close
to being disbarred

35:22.382 --> 35:23.687
for not protecting
your client.

35:23.818 --> 35:25.341
But I am protecting my client.

35:25.472 --> 35:27.648
My client is PDtroniX,

35:27.778 --> 35:30.172
and I believe
Mason Keen is a bad actor

35:30.303 --> 35:32.000
who created a deepfake
of Jane Lin

35:32.130 --> 35:33.654
to cover his theft

35:33.784 --> 35:36.352
of her work,
and that theft has earned him

35:36.483 --> 35:39.094
multiple bonuses, which means
he is accepting ill-gotten gains

35:39.224 --> 35:40.965
and is participating

35:41.096 --> 35:43.316
in an ongoing fraud
and should be prosecuted

35:43.446 --> 35:44.926
to the fullest extent
of the law.

35:45.056 --> 35:46.667
Defense hereby requests

35:46.797 --> 35:49.234
a warrant for his phone
and computer immediately.

35:49.365 --> 35:50.279
You don't need a warrant.

35:50.410 --> 35:52.237
I'm the boss,
and your phone

35:52.368 --> 35:54.457
is company property.
Hand it over.

35:56.633 --> 35:58.461
Hand it over, Mr. Keen.

36:01.899 --> 36:03.466
Fine.

36:08.515 --> 36:09.733
You swizzled the app to add

36:09.864 --> 36:12.170
spyware on
every employee?

36:13.346 --> 36:15.609
He manipulated it so he could
see what any employee typed,

36:15.739 --> 36:18.351
even on their home computers
or phones,

36:18.481 --> 36:20.222
including Jane's.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.529
You're fired.

36:23.660 --> 36:24.835
And my client
will receive credit

36:24.966 --> 36:28.012
as the creator
of Unexpected Flame.

36:28.143 --> 36:30.014
With all the back pay
and bonuses she deserves.

36:30.145 --> 36:31.755
And restoration

36:31.886 --> 36:34.062
of full equity
- and all charges dropped.
- Yes.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.674
Then... maybe you'll
take your job back?

36:37.805 --> 36:41.852
No. I'm gonna form
my own company.

36:41.983 --> 36:43.941
I'll have corporate papers
drawn up by my new attorney--

36:44.072 --> 36:45.552
Todd Wright.

36:45.682 --> 36:47.815
Oh. [laughs] Well...

36:47.945 --> 36:49.512
we have to talk.

36:50.948 --> 36:53.211
Well, that was
some seriously...

36:53.342 --> 36:54.343
Creative.

36:54.474 --> 36:57.128
...diabolical lawyering.

36:57.259 --> 36:58.956
You're just mad

36:59.087 --> 37:01.742
because I got the best of you
for a second time.

37:01.872 --> 37:03.134
You mean by proving
my client was actually wronged

37:03.265 --> 37:04.397
by your client?

37:06.355 --> 37:09.097
So, new settlement conference
where we all show up?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.316
Just tell me what time of day
you're allowed to eat,

37:11.447 --> 37:12.927
and I'll put out a real spread.

37:13.057 --> 37:15.059
Well,

37:15.190 --> 37:18.585
I look forward to getting
the best of you this time.

37:26.549 --> 37:29.247
- Ah.
- You did it.

37:29.378 --> 37:31.119
- <i>We</i> did it.
- Yes,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.556
but you went to the mat
for Jane and everyone.

37:33.687 --> 37:35.123
- Yes, I did.
- And you'd do

37:35.253 --> 37:36.951
the same for me
and Allison, too.

37:37.081 --> 37:38.387
And the other one.

37:38.518 --> 37:41.172
All your kids.

37:41.303 --> 37:44.175
This whole meddling
and controlling

37:44.306 --> 37:48.832
stuff and snooping is just
for protection, isn't it?

37:48.963 --> 37:50.834
Snooping?

37:50.965 --> 37:54.577
You found my sweater
in Allison's house, didn't you?

37:56.623 --> 37:58.538
It's in my office.

37:58.668 --> 38:00.453
Uh, I don't know.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.150
What do you want to do about it?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.848
Uh...

38:04.979 --> 38:08.330
I think
that no one ever really knows

38:08.461 --> 38:12.290
what goes on inside
of anyone's marriage.

38:12.421 --> 38:13.640
I mean, look at mine.

38:13.770 --> 38:14.902
- Hmm.
- And even though

38:15.032 --> 38:17.600
I think
Chuck is perfect for her,

38:17.731 --> 38:20.429
I guess... put
the sweater back.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.170
And I won't say anything

38:22.300 --> 38:24.868
until she tells me
that she needs me.

38:24.999 --> 38:27.175
Hmm.

38:28.742 --> 38:30.526
I don't have a four-top.

38:30.657 --> 38:32.702
I don't know the specials.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.835
It's your job, Francisco.

38:34.965 --> 38:36.271
How am I supposed to know that?

38:39.274 --> 38:42.799
God. You got to stop doing that.
I could have killed you!

38:42.930 --> 38:46.107
With an old plastic Wiffle
ball bat? I don't think so.

38:46.237 --> 38:47.935
Anyway, we're home.

38:48.065 --> 38:49.893
You can shower
in the house again.

38:50.024 --> 38:51.547
Great.

38:54.681 --> 38:56.204
Are you okay?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.336
Yeah, just, um...

38:58.467 --> 39:00.338
Did you sleep in my guest room?

39:00.469 --> 39:02.079
What? No. Why?

39:02.210 --> 39:04.299
'Cause everything in that room
is, like, nice now.

39:04.429 --> 39:09.696
Like, the pillows and
the dresser got... rearranged.

39:09.826 --> 39:11.306
What were you really
doing in my house?

39:11.436 --> 39:13.090
I know it wasn't a leak.

39:13.221 --> 39:14.614
I was...

39:19.662 --> 39:22.578
Did you put up a dating profile
on Unexpected Flame?

39:24.667 --> 39:27.235
Mom thought she saw it when
she was working on a case.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.064
It looked like you were wearing
her red striped sweater?

39:30.194 --> 39:35.156
So, yeah, I went in
to see if I could... find it.

39:35.286 --> 39:37.680
And did you?

39:52.260 --> 39:56.438
My whole life
has been designed by Mom.

39:56.569 --> 39:59.702
Like, I was always the good girl
and I did what I was told

39:59.833 --> 40:02.879
and I became a doctor,
I married Chuck.

40:05.882 --> 40:08.798
Do you... not love
Chuck anymore?

40:08.929 --> 40:10.670
No, I do.

40:11.714 --> 40:14.587
I-I do. I just, um...

40:19.330 --> 40:23.813
I just never made a choice
for myself, and...

40:26.860 --> 40:29.079
I think maybe I wondered
what it would be like

40:29.210 --> 40:31.255
to have something...

40:31.386 --> 40:34.432
unexpected... happen.

40:34.563 --> 40:37.261
Hey, Al, want me
to unpack your suitcase

40:37.392 --> 40:38.132
and start the laundry?

40:39.916 --> 40:41.309
Al?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.093
Please don't tell him.

40:43.224 --> 40:45.879
One of the nurses mentioned
the app at work,

40:46.009 --> 40:47.532
and I downloaded it on a whim.

40:47.663 --> 40:51.014
I-I never planned to...

40:53.451 --> 40:54.757
We're fine.

40:54.888 --> 40:56.759
I'll delete the app.

40:56.890 --> 40:58.456
I barely even looked at it.
I just...

40:59.501 --> 41:00.676
Please don't tell him.

41:00.807 --> 41:03.592
I won't. I wouldn't.

41:03.723 --> 41:04.767
You could trust me.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.773
Thank you.

41:13.428 --> 41:15.038
Um...

41:16.649 --> 41:19.173
...did you tell Mom
that you found the sweater?

41:19.303 --> 41:20.914
No.

41:21.044 --> 41:22.829
Okay.
