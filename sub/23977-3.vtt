WEBVTT

00:16.520 --> 00:18.752
- Wow look at all that salad!

00:18.752 --> 00:20.449
That's loads.

00:20.449 --> 00:21.840
- Barry, could you move, I can't actually,

00:21.840 --> 00:22.673
- Oh yeah my bad.

00:22.673 --> 00:24.233
- Get the food out.

00:26.350 --> 00:28.893
- I gotta say, I'm so excited to be here.

00:29.993 --> 00:31.850
I can't wait to meet your parents.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.823
I love families, just do.

00:34.986 --> 00:36.059
- Because with Jan and

00:36.059 --> 00:38.830
our two beautiful daughters, I've

00:38.830 --> 00:41.450
I've spent my whole life
surrounded by women.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.100
- What are you complaining about?

00:44.720 --> 00:45.920
- Which means I

00:45.920 --> 00:47.670
- You don't get a word in edgewise?

00:49.130 --> 00:50.950
- I never get a word in edgewise.

00:50.950 --> 00:51.783
- Oh sorry Mike.

00:52.890 --> 00:53.723
- But

00:54.870 --> 00:57.270
I wouldn't change it for the world.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.883
- I love you all so very much.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.017
- Wow.

01:05.017 --> 01:06.790
Wowza, wowza.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.423
I'd like to say a few words.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.720
What a guy, huh, Mike?

01:13.720 --> 01:16.613
Seriously good father, seriously good guy.

01:16.613 --> 01:19.820
I guess you're all
wondering who's this guy.

01:19.820 --> 01:22.660
I'm Logan, Logan Mann, I'm

01:23.550 --> 01:26.130
I'm Samantha's new squeeze Samantha's new

01:26.130 --> 01:27.370
new boyfriend.

01:27.370 --> 01:28.603
We're official, right?

01:30.430 --> 01:31.580
Come up here come on.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.070
I'm nothing without you gal.

01:33.070 --> 01:33.903
I need you here.

01:36.980 --> 01:37.813
Look at her huh?

01:38.720 --> 01:39.920
Isn't she beautiful?

01:39.920 --> 01:44.380
But today isn't about me, or Samantha.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.720
It's about love.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.450
I'm talking about these two,

01:48.450 --> 01:49.283
Jan and Mike.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.680
It hasn't all been plain sailing, hey?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.350
It's had its ups and its downs.

01:54.350 --> 01:57.050
Big down of course 2003,

01:57.050 --> 02:01.483
where Mike hooked up with
Rosemary from the tennis club,

02:02.550 --> 02:05.600
lured by the promise of
more adventurous sex.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.930
But he, he realized the error of his ways.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.800
You know, he wanted to win back his

02:10.800 --> 02:12.250
his little firecracker.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.400
And look at her, there.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.740
Look at her little firecracker.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.400
He got her back, by God he got her back.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.324
I never knew who my parents were,

02:21.157 --> 02:21.990
didn't have much of a family.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.760
So,

02:24.760 --> 02:28.400
thank you for having me here
in this special occasion.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.233
I love you mum.

02:30.769 --> 02:31.998
I love you dad.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.126
- What was that?

02:35.126 --> 02:36.370
What were you thinking?

02:36.370 --> 02:37.454
- I well I was

02:37.454 --> 02:39.750
Was that a wrong thing to do?

02:39.750 --> 02:41.290
- Yes.

02:41.290 --> 02:43.040
It was wrong.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.439
How did you know all
that stuff about my dad?

02:45.439 --> 02:46.272
- Oh god,

02:46.272 --> 02:47.620
are we having our first argument girl?

02:47.620 --> 02:49.130
Oh no I'm freaking out.

02:49.130 --> 02:53.170
- Logan, we've been on
a couple of dates just

02:53.170 --> 02:54.290
slow it down.

02:54.290 --> 02:57.283
- You have my word I swear on my life.

02:57.283 --> 02:58.116
- Okay

03:02.273 --> 03:03.367
- What the hell was that all about?

03:03.367 --> 03:04.740
How did he know all that stuff?

03:04.740 --> 03:06.489
- I honestly haven't
told him anything dad.

03:07.610 --> 03:08.969
He's not what you think.

03:09.802 --> 03:11.323
He's actually really sweet.

03:21.648 --> 03:22.481
- Ah!

03:50.797 --> 03:53.047
- This is not a real clown.

03:54.659 --> 03:57.603
This is a man dressed as a clown.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.273
- That's what clowns are.

04:04.860 --> 04:05.693
- Really?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.300
- Yes.

04:08.300 --> 04:09.520
- Take your clown

04:10.880 --> 04:13.393
and get out of my party.

04:19.090 --> 04:23.120
- Gentlemen as you are aware,

04:23.120 --> 04:26.550
I now have Antelope's Tail in my position.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.753
The world is shitting nickers.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.850
This can only mean good
things for my position in

04:33.850 --> 04:38.260
Interpol's Top Ten Most Wanted Bad Asses.

04:38.260 --> 04:41.898
Sergei pray tell where do I stand.

04:41.898 --> 04:43.383
- You are number five.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.800
- I shit on five!

04:46.731 --> 04:48.354
You know what?

04:48.354 --> 04:51.630
I have brilliant plan
to keep to numero uno.

04:51.630 --> 04:52.713
Sergei take notes.

04:53.610 --> 04:55.040
So here it is,

04:55.040 --> 05:00.040
we invite other ten top
most wanted bad guys

05:00.090 --> 05:04.670
to secret auction using
Antelope's Tail as bait.

05:04.670 --> 05:08.190
But, we play mind games.

05:08.190 --> 05:11.560
So is it a real auction to sell device,

05:11.560 --> 05:14.705
or is it a trap to kill them?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.501
- Okay, but just to be clear

05:16.501 --> 05:19.490
we going to make real
auction or it's a trick?

05:19.490 --> 05:22.067
- Of course we are or are we?

05:23.202 --> 05:25.369
Is it to trap or isn't it?

05:27.116 --> 05:29.265
- No I guess that,
but I think it's important

05:29.265 --> 05:31.109
that at least we know if it's trap

05:31.109 --> 05:32.997
or I cannot organize.

05:32.997 --> 05:37.660
- Rengard can you please inform this bozo

05:37.660 --> 05:40.240
what are mind games, please?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.179
- I'm sorry.

05:42.179 --> 05:44.863
I don't know what is mind games.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.890
Or do I?

05:49.890 --> 05:53.538
- You see Rengard gets it.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.420
- Gentlemen this is Bad News.

05:59.420 --> 06:03.272
I have employed her to pass
on all of the bad news.

06:03.272 --> 06:04.937
Because she is so hot.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.237
The bad news doesn't feel quite so bad.

06:10.712 --> 06:12.633
What is it my trickletart?

06:12.633 --> 06:17.633
- The assassination attempt
on Logan Mann has failed.

06:18.175 --> 06:19.440
- Oh, right?

06:19.440 --> 06:24.440
- And Gavril has
been seized by MI6 operatives.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.737
- Well that is actually some,

06:26.737 --> 06:29.546
that is some really bad news.

06:29.546 --> 06:31.160
- What if Gavril talks?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.520
- Don't worry yourself old mother hen.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.680
He'll keep his mouth shut.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.120
You see all of my Abacus assassins

06:40.120 --> 06:41.933
is issued with one of these,

06:43.130 --> 06:45.490
deadly cyanide pills.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.713
Knowing that each and everyone of you

06:49.153 --> 06:51.527
would rather die than talk.

07:00.433 --> 07:01.760
- Loss of control of the jaw.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.020
Bottom lip starting to shiver.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.810
Pupils dilated, dry mouth.

07:04.810 --> 07:06.320
Don't know what to do with his left hand.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.153
However with the right one,

07:07.153 --> 07:08.420
he's stroking his little pom pom there

07:08.420 --> 07:10.330
with his inner palm for comfort.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.720
- What's wrong with him?

07:11.720 --> 07:14.060
- He's off his fucking swede mate.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.480
- Flipflop!

07:15.480 --> 07:16.820
- Geezer's peaking out

07:16.820 --> 07:18.136
I'll have to get on his
level a little though

07:18.136 --> 07:20.330
to gain his trust, you know?

07:20.330 --> 07:21.990
Now, I reckon some MDMA,

07:21.990 --> 07:23.073
couple of a bombs, little snifter kittens

07:23.073 --> 07:25.540
to take the edge off.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.682
Nice one, got a little bit of weed

07:26.682 --> 07:28.052
leftover from Crimbo.

07:28.052 --> 07:29.370
Now, what I need you to do is get

07:29.370 --> 07:30.560
your ass down to the shops and buy

07:30.560 --> 07:32.970
me a box of menthol cigarettes
and ice cold Stellas.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.370
Must be ice cold, understood?

07:35.370 --> 07:37.310
- I don't agree with
your drinks and drugs.

07:37.310 --> 07:40.070
I think people that
take them are quite sad.

07:40.070 --> 07:42.750
- Look, do you have a problem with me?

07:42.750 --> 07:44.290
- Maybe you've got a
problem with yourself,

07:44.290 --> 07:46.290
so that's why you take
so much drinks and drugs,

07:46.290 --> 07:47.964
so you can run away
from who you really are.

07:47.964 --> 07:52.964
Oh!

07:53.634 --> 07:58.634
- Dick.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.392
- How the hell did you get in here, man?

08:23.392 --> 08:24.430
- I broke a window.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.350
But then I couldn't fit through it

08:26.350 --> 08:27.490
so I smashed your door.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.600
- You smashed my door?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.710
- They tried to kill me, Ruth.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.380
In my home!

08:33.380 --> 08:34.760
Well it wasn't actually my home,

08:34.760 --> 08:35.940
it was my girlfriend's but it

08:35.940 --> 08:38.334
wasn't actually her place
it was her parents' place

08:38.334 --> 08:39.375
- All right stop.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.208
Who tried to kill you?

08:40.208 --> 08:42.090
- A clown assassin attacked me.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.720
How did he know where I was?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.430
I'm telling you now, we got a mole.

08:46.430 --> 08:47.750
A dirty great leak.

08:47.750 --> 08:48.583
- Right.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.290
Well I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.520
- I'll say it a million
times so you believe me.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.704
We got a leak, we got
a leak, we got a leak

08:54.704 --> 08:56.530
- All right just shut up.

08:56.530 --> 08:58.100
- Let me start again, please.

08:58.100 --> 08:58.933
We got a leak, we got a

08:58.933 --> 09:00.210
- No just stop it!

09:00.210 --> 09:02.860
Now, this assassin, do
you think he'll talk?

09:02.860 --> 09:05.510
- You bet your spaghetti
bolognese he'll talk.

09:05.510 --> 09:08.220
Permission to take this
thing brown bananas.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.167
- What what are you talking about?

09:09.167 --> 09:11.140
- Approving to pickle a sticky Thomas

09:11.140 --> 09:12.160
- A what?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.520
- Schevchenko was tipped off in Bulgaria.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.140
I need to take this thing!

09:16.140 --> 09:17.860
Deaf, dumb and blind.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.970
No eyes, no ears.

09:19.970 --> 09:20.803
- Right well,

09:20.803 --> 09:22.370
why didn't you just say
that in the first place?

09:22.370 --> 09:25.603
- Mark my words, someone under that roof

09:25.603 --> 09:28.978
is not who they say they are.

09:33.014 --> 09:34.395
- Hi.

09:34.395 --> 09:35.228
- Hey.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.190
- I just wanted to say Graham,

09:39.190 --> 09:41.510
thank you for dinner last night.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.780
You really are a good cook.

09:42.780 --> 09:45.030
- Nah chili con carn

09:45.976 --> 09:47.993
Yeah, I really enjoyed it, it was great.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.320
- Any joy for the assassins' handset?

09:51.320 --> 09:52.520
- Well, this little guy.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.770
Lovely little key actually.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.983
He's using a dynamic IP aren't you mate?

09:59.158 --> 10:00.130
Yeah, with the new anonymity tool

10:00.130 --> 10:01.800
designed to conceal his user's identity

10:01.800 --> 10:03.810
and heavily encrypt all communication.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.090
My guess is the whole
of the Abacus Network

10:06.090 --> 10:07.920
is using the secure connection.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.460
Now, I've cracked the username.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.230
That was a piece of solid piss.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.940
But I just need the eight-digit passcode

10:12.940 --> 10:13.890
to gain entry so, I

10:15.880 --> 10:17.823
- I like that you're so clever.

10:21.137 --> 10:22.370
- I like the smell of your hair.

10:22.370 --> 10:23.230
- Do you?

10:23.230 --> 10:24.760
- Big time.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.593
- Thank you.

10:25.593 --> 10:26.426
It's um,

10:28.560 --> 10:30.043
It's a medicated shampoo.

10:30.950 --> 10:33.440
- What for the treatment of psoriasis?

10:33.440 --> 10:34.273
- Yes.

10:36.610 --> 10:38.543
I have a flaky scalp.

10:39.750 --> 10:40.583
- Well, well

10:42.030 --> 10:44.400
I believe it contains a coal tar

10:45.320 --> 10:46.860
which relieves itching and also restores

10:46.860 --> 10:48.060
skin structure by slowing down

10:48.060 --> 10:49.610
the process of cell production.

10:51.980 --> 10:55.950
- Oh, I wish I could
just kiss you right now.

10:55.950 --> 10:56.783
- Fair enough.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.233
I am a very thorough lover, FYI.

11:04.050 --> 11:04.883
- Oh yeah?

11:07.509 --> 11:09.092
I will destroy you.

11:16.257 --> 11:19.163
- Before I worked for this Fezzy guy.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.063
I'm like a powerful mountain.

11:23.063 --> 11:24.084
- Yeah.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.487
- All around there were fish swimming.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.921
I don't really like fish.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.500
- But you are the fish,
you know what I'm saying?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.083
You're a fish mate.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.961
Do you think I look like my mum?

11:38.961 --> 11:39.794
How about now?

11:39.794 --> 11:40.703
What about now?

11:41.536 --> 11:42.369
- Fuck off, fuck off.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.202
Fuck!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.035
- What?

11:44.035 --> 11:45.760
- Gav mate the table
man, it's freaking out.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.683
Fucking I don't like the way
it's looking at me Gav man.

11:47.683 --> 11:49.180
- Want me to kill the table?

11:49.180 --> 11:50.065
- Yeah we need to.

11:50.065 --> 11:50.898
- Gavril to table!

11:55.613 --> 11:58.446
When I was little small boy child,

11:59.664 --> 12:01.714
I wanted to be dance.

12:01.714 --> 12:03.150
- Yeah?

12:03.150 --> 12:04.400
- Papa said no,

12:08.765 --> 12:09.598
Oh.

12:13.614 --> 12:14.447
My unicorn

12:15.771 --> 12:18.604
I want to ride you to magic place!

12:33.862 --> 12:35.570
I'm a bad man.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.996
- No, no you're not

12:36.996 --> 12:38.287
- I've been bad man.

12:38.287 --> 12:40.410
- No sh, sh no cause you're a good man.

12:40.410 --> 12:41.507
Really good, you're good.

12:41.507 --> 12:44.010
- Mon?

12:44.010 --> 12:44.843
Monica.

12:46.370 --> 12:47.490
Hey mon.

12:47.490 --> 12:48.323
Mon?

12:49.949 --> 12:50.782
- Grandad?

12:54.660 --> 12:56.040
Grandad is that you?

12:56.040 --> 12:58.573
- No it's me Logan.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.293
Listen,

13:02.520 --> 13:07.120
we need the Abacus passcode
for that email network.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.210
- The passcode just, um, no...

13:11.210 --> 13:12.720
Can I get some water in here, please?

13:12.720 --> 13:13.560
I'm proper dry.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.680
- Oh yeah.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.796
- Gav.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.629
- Huh?

13:16.629 --> 13:20.849
- Babe can I get your web
email thing passcode thing,

13:21.682 --> 13:22.830
please?

13:22.830 --> 13:23.672
What is it Gav?

13:23.672 --> 13:24.755
- Uh

13:26.044 --> 13:27.360
23

13:28.684 --> 13:30.965
04

13:30.965 --> 13:31.798
1974

13:33.688 --> 13:34.521
- I'm in.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.380
The eagle has landed and he's
laid a rather interesting egg.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.270
An email egg sent today.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.103
- Feed me.

13:44.103 --> 13:45.100
Feed me data.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.810
- Sender, Vlad Schevchenko,

13:46.810 --> 13:49.303
Subject, the Antelope's
Tail Auction Location,

13:51.560 --> 13:52.913
Saint Petersburg, Russia.

13:55.746 --> 13:57.573
- We fly east.

13:59.210 --> 14:00.943
Fire up the chopper boys.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.497
- Are guests all present yet?

14:29.130 --> 14:30.540
Does it seem to you Sergei

14:30.540 --> 14:32.843
that the good time in the cards?

14:33.698 --> 14:36.625
- Yes, why are you do anxious?

14:36.625 --> 14:37.542
- Truth is.

14:38.663 --> 14:42.823
When I was a little
gopnik of only ten years.

14:43.990 --> 14:46.593
My mother had a birthday party for me.

14:47.650 --> 14:50.760
She invited all other
children from my school.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.370
She made her famous kolaczki.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.270
- Oh I love kolaczkis.

14:54.270 --> 14:57.270
- Stop thinking of your stomach.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.110
You fat horse.

14:59.110 --> 15:00.710
- Sorry.

15:00.710 --> 15:05.710
- We waited for hours and hours
for what seemed like days.

15:06.411 --> 15:08.270
But no one came.

15:08.270 --> 15:12.450
In my bedroom that eve had I made a vow,

15:12.450 --> 15:14.673
to never ever have another party.

15:16.022 --> 15:16.855
Until now.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.687
- Well it's not really a party, it's a

15:20.270 --> 15:24.036
gathering stratagem with a
mass murder tied to the end.

15:24.036 --> 15:26.652
- I just want people to like me Sergei.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.530
- I like you.

15:28.530 --> 15:32.850
- Very sweet but you're
opinion matters so very little.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.633
Scurry along like menace.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.563
Get started on the plan.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.570
- Sorry I don't speak that.

15:48.570 --> 15:50.240
- Sorry who the fuck are you?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.356
What agency?

15:51.356 --> 15:53.603
- One minute I just found out, yeah?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.640
My name is John-Paul.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.070
I'm 24 years old,

16:00.070 --> 16:00.993
training chef.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.910
I think I was suppose to
read this in a French accent,

16:04.910 --> 16:05.743
can I start again?

16:05.743 --> 16:06.576
- No listen,

16:06.576 --> 16:07.409
- What's your name?

16:07.409 --> 16:08.940
- My name is Head Chef Sam Miguel

16:08.940 --> 16:09.860
- Oh like the beer.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.440
- No, Sam.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.640
Sam Miguel.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.310
- Yeah I know but there's
a beer called that.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.010
- My name is Sam Miguel.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.310
- San Miguel?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.280
- Sam, with an M.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.113
- San Miguel.

16:20.113 --> 16:20.946
- Sam Miguel.

16:20.946 --> 16:21.920
- San Miguel.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.170
- Sam Miguel.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.330
- It still sounds like San Miguel.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.990
- It's not important get back to work.

16:26.990 --> 16:27.823
- San Miguel.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.372
- Take these tablets grind them up.

16:36.372 --> 16:38.951
Put powder in everyone's dessert.

16:38.951 --> 16:39.987
It's poison.

16:39.987 --> 16:41.580
Cyanide.

16:41.580 --> 16:45.240
Everyone that enters the
dining room will die tonight.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.083
Everyone must die.

16:48.150 --> 16:52.830
- I spy with my little eye
something beginning with

16:52.830 --> 16:55.090
the most wanted dangerous
men in the bloody world

16:55.090 --> 16:57.190
hanging around having a chin wag together.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.733
This can only spell trouble.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.208
T-R-O-U

17:02.208 --> 17:03.876
- Yeah all right mate,
all right I get the gist

17:03.876 --> 17:04.808
- Mhm.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.675
- You're not gonna do
this all day are you?

17:10.949 --> 17:13.470
Fucking hate recon, some wankers.

17:13.470 --> 17:14.303
- Huh?

17:16.797 --> 17:18.885
Ah I love it mate.

17:18.885 --> 17:21.700
You know, my favorite part
of the job to be honest.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.070
Just watching people.

17:23.070 --> 17:24.950
Some times I do it when
I'm not even at work.

17:24.950 --> 17:27.600
- That's not fucking weird at all is it?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.020
Who do you watch?

17:29.020 --> 17:29.853
- Business men.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.453
Families in parks.

17:33.690 --> 17:34.963
Keep me sharp.

17:36.650 --> 17:39.660
- You telling me you sit
around in parks watching kids?

17:39.660 --> 17:41.650
- Well it sounds weird
when you say it like that.

17:41.650 --> 17:42.700
- Yeah.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.163
- This man is strictly women only.

17:47.170 --> 17:48.940
I do not fancy kids.

17:48.940 --> 17:50.360
- You need to stop talking Graham.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.970
- I do not like the kid kids.

17:53.970 --> 17:55.470
- All right stop saying kids.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.670
- Except for when I was a kid.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.840
Then I fancied kids but I was a kid.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.563
Lost my virginity when
I was nine in a sauna.

18:03.530 --> 18:04.430
We did everything.

18:05.650 --> 18:10.110
- Welcome other global bad guys.

18:10.110 --> 18:12.283
You fiends you deviants.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.660
You gentlemen have all come here

18:15.660 --> 18:17.823
for auction of Antelope's Tail.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.723
Who would like to start the bidding?

18:21.580 --> 18:23.680
- I will start with, say

18:24.700 --> 18:25.533
million dollars.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.070
- Bueno, two then.

18:29.070 --> 18:29.903
Two millions

18:32.268 --> 18:33.720
- 1.5 billion.

18:35.884 --> 18:38.190
- 1.5 billion?

18:38.190 --> 18:39.060
Are you crazy?

18:39.060 --> 18:42.663
That is a hell of a leap from two million.

18:43.710 --> 18:47.760
It's truly an insane amount of money.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.340
I'm going to guess that nobody

18:49.340 --> 18:51.663
can compete with that amount.

18:53.580 --> 18:57.203
So it seems that the
device has a new owner.

18:58.150 --> 19:02.062
Sorry I forget your name, mister?

19:03.151 --> 19:05.290
- Just call me Mark.

19:05.290 --> 19:08.927
- Well Mark maybe you will like to tell me

19:08.927 --> 19:12.453
and the champs a little
bit about yourself.

19:12.453 --> 19:16.191
Because I'm fascinated to hear your story.

19:16.191 --> 19:18.130
- I'm from a small African Republic

19:18.130 --> 19:20.580
that's so scary no one dare say it's name.

19:20.580 --> 19:23.740
It's night all the time
there, 24 hours a day.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.740
But on the plus side we have
a thriving export business,

19:26.740 --> 19:31.043
selling chili bean sandals and
the surfing, well, excellent.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.053
- Can anybody else smell that?

19:42.310 --> 19:45.590
Smells to me a lot like bullshit!

19:45.590 --> 19:49.700
Looks to me like we have
been infiltrated gentlemen,

19:49.700 --> 19:51.913
by an unwanted guest.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.450
Wouldn't you say Mr. Mann.

19:56.450 --> 19:57.620
- What?

19:57.620 --> 20:00.043
I can assure you you are mistaken sir.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.290
- Oh come on I know you're in there Mann.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.203
- Oh I'm not.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.450
- Are you kidding with me Mr. Mann.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.070
I know it is you in there.

20:16.070 --> 20:18.340
- It isn't me I'm this guy.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.670
- Who the hell is this?

20:19.670 --> 20:22.304
Are you not at least going
to attempt to do a voice?

20:22.304 --> 20:24.030
- Which one am I at the moment?

20:24.030 --> 20:26.030
- I don't know, you have like a mustache

20:26.030 --> 20:27.700
like you're suppose to be Spanish?

20:27.700 --> 20:30.270
- Oh no he's
Greek I think, but I don't

20:30.270 --> 20:32.553
actually know how Greek people sound.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.620
- Oh come on Mann,
you know also you can get

20:38.620 --> 20:41.300
like a voice box it's a voice changer.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.250
- I didn't know that actually.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.793
- This is stupid now.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.605
- There he is.

20:49.605 --> 20:52.523
- Okay, okay, you got me.

20:55.120 --> 20:55.953
- Hello?

20:59.196 --> 21:00.029
- Hello?

21:12.380 --> 21:15.722
- Did you really think you could just

21:15.722 --> 21:20.600
waltz in here and take
Antelope's Tail from me?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.580
- Well that was the plan.

21:22.580 --> 21:27.363
- Only question is, now,
how exactly we kill you?

21:29.345 --> 21:32.120
- Logan don't eat the food
it's got poison in it.

21:32.120 --> 21:32.953
- What?

21:32.953 --> 21:34.739
Did you all hear that?

21:34.739 --> 21:37.994
Vlad intended to kill you
the food was poisoned.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.818
- Let's do this.

21:56.678 --> 21:58.466
- This is some kind of
elaborate mousetrap?

21:58.466 --> 21:59.840
- No, no, no!

22:00.960 --> 22:02.610
It isn't like that.

22:02.610 --> 22:05.379
- I knew we shouldn't have
trusted you Schevchenko.

22:05.379 --> 22:07.055
- You know something
actually El Chito?

22:07.055 --> 22:10.608
That is a very awful thing to say!

22:10.608 --> 22:12.723
Did any of you think that maybe

22:12.723 --> 22:15.760
the reason I might want to kill all of you

22:15.760 --> 22:17.210
is 'cause I don't feel like an

22:17.210 --> 22:19.663
integral member of this friendship group?

22:20.900 --> 22:22.720
Because I'm not as cool as you are.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.813
- No, no way man.

22:25.967 --> 22:28.180
You're like so cool because

22:28.180 --> 22:30.150
you don't think you're so cool.

22:30.150 --> 22:32.940
So you're cool.

22:32.940 --> 22:36.873
- Well that is very nice.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.350
Kind of makes a little bit of sense.

22:41.350 --> 22:43.343
- I really like your beard, man.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.180
I wish I had the confidence to grow one.

22:48.180 --> 22:51.800
- What are you talking about confidence?

22:51.800 --> 22:54.510
You're hair it always looks so good no?

22:54.510 --> 22:56.393
And you always dress so good.

22:58.321 --> 22:59.170
- Thank you very much.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.720
- Hey why don't we put some tunes on, huh?

23:01.720 --> 23:03.803
I feel like I need to dance.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.945
- It is not definitely not cyanide.

23:13.945 --> 23:16.470
- Sorry Vlad, we failed you.

23:16.470 --> 23:21.110
- Oh stop slob don't waste your tears.

23:21.110 --> 23:24.903
This whole thing you've
got way more excited.

23:26.170 --> 23:27.003
Go to plan B!

23:28.290 --> 23:29.270
And plan C!

23:30.492 --> 23:31.409
To B and C!

23:44.122 --> 23:46.789
- No, no please, please God no.
