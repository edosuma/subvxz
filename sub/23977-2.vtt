00:00.833 --> 00:03.666
.

00:15.398 --> 00:19.731
.

00:23.713 --> 00:26.130
.

00:36.095 --> 00:39.178
.

00:46.344 --> 00:48.164
- The antelope's tail.

00:48.164 --> 00:49.664
- It is beautiful.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.705
Oh shit.

01:02.705 --> 01:05.205
I locked the keys in the boot.

01:11.510 --> 01:13.143
- Hello, caller you are through

01:13.143 --> 01:16.130
to Vladimir Schevchenko's main office.

01:16.130 --> 01:17.860
You're on his speaker phone.

01:17.860 --> 01:18.697
Everybody say hello.

01:18.697 --> 01:20.268
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:20.268 --> 01:21.380
- Hello.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.420
- Vladimir, it is me, my love.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.100
- Oh hey baby girl.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.924
How are you?

01:28.820 --> 01:31.273
You'll never guess who I'm with.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.190
Rengard.

01:33.190 --> 01:37.324
He's the toughest guy I know, you know?

01:37.324 --> 01:39.750
He doesn't feel any pain.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.880
In fact, since he was shot in his head,

01:43.880 --> 01:46.467
he doesn't feel anything at all.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.700
- Good to meet you.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.800
Mr. Softy is so in love with you.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.896
I love you.

01:54.896 --> 01:56.726
I am so needy.

01:56.726 --> 01:57.968
LOL.

01:57.968 --> 02:00.271
- Rengard, what you doing?

02:00.271 --> 02:02.700
I'm trying to play cool with this chick.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.540
You fucking...

02:04.540 --> 02:06.120
Baby!

02:06.120 --> 02:08.340
He was just joking, my love.

02:08.340 --> 02:11.430
He was just pranking
around like a pranker.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.797
- My darling, we have successfully seized

02:13.797 --> 02:15.464
the antelope's tail.

02:18.987 --> 02:21.180
- You swear it on your life?

02:21.180 --> 02:22.780
- Double swears, and no returns.

02:24.736 --> 02:27.033
- I completely believe you.

02:31.286 --> 02:32.536
Bring it to me.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.830
- You're such a good listener.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.960
- Well I have to be.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.173
It's part of my job.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.853
- What is it that you do?

02:51.140 --> 02:54.093
- I make those big hats
that Chinese people wear.

02:55.904 --> 02:56.904
- Oh, right.

02:58.754 --> 03:00.560
Don't they call them conicals?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.480
- Oh, I don't know about that.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.030
I think it's fine just to
call them Chinese people.

03:06.292 --> 03:08.510
- No, I meant the hats.

03:14.768 --> 03:17.185
- Oh, sorry, I must get that.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.460
Dammit!

03:24.460 --> 03:25.700
Damn it.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.130
My grandmother.

03:27.130 --> 03:30.710
Her parakeet, John Edward, has escaped.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.153
So I must go to her.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.579
I need you to know that I like you

03:36.579 --> 03:39.793
and you look beautiful tonight.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.173
I don't know, it's the lighting,

03:42.173 --> 03:44.352
and the way you've done your hair.

03:44.352 --> 03:49.226
- You should go find
that parakeet.

03:49.226 --> 03:50.059
- What?

03:53.180 --> 03:55.483
Oh, yes, yeah of course.

03:56.978 --> 03:58.233
Good night, pretty lady.

04:02.084 --> 04:04.930
.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.320
- Right, now, as you know,

04:06.320 --> 04:07.890
we have been working tirelessly

04:07.890 --> 04:10.016
on building a file on Vlad Schevchenko.

04:10.016 --> 04:14.050
Up until now, intel has
been relatively scarce.

04:14.050 --> 04:17.780
But last night, we made a
massive breakthrough, okay?

04:17.780 --> 04:19.100
This is Rebekkah Volk.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.823
Anne, as we've practiced.

04:22.420 --> 04:25.990
- So she is Vlad Schevchenko's girlfriend,

04:25.990 --> 04:28.950
but we believe potentially his number two.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.280
- Right, now we have been
monitoring Volk's phone activity

04:31.280 --> 04:34.680
and we have found some very
interesting information, Anne?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.060
- Well thanks, Ruth.

04:36.060 --> 04:39.220
On Tuesday, she contacted
Schevchenko from Rabat.

04:39.220 --> 04:41.150
Then she called him again
on Wednesday from Zurich--

04:41.150 --> 04:43.110
- Thursday Ljubljana, Slovenia.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.750
Now, we believe she is
taking something to him.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.900
We have also found out that she is having

04:47.900 --> 04:51.730
a birthday party in Sofia, Bulgaria.

04:51.730 --> 04:52.980
I need Volk bugged.

04:52.980 --> 04:54.130
I want her filmed.

04:54.130 --> 04:55.820
Logan, you are gonna have to befriend her,

04:55.820 --> 04:57.590
so you'll have do whatever is necessary.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.390
- Well, I gotta throw this into the mix.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.868
I've just started seeing someone.

05:02.868 --> 05:04.525
- Have ya?

05:04.525 --> 05:07.593
- It's early days but I
really like this girl.

05:07.593 --> 05:08.703
- Congratulations.

05:08.703 --> 05:10.289
- Listen, I'm happy to tap it, I mean

05:10.289 --> 05:12.200
not usually my bag, but you know

05:12.200 --> 05:13.033
when I've had a drink

05:13.033 --> 05:14.500
I've messed about with
mates and stuff you know.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.240
Any hole's a goal, and all that.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.010
- No, Monica, thank you.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.355
Logan, your target.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.740
- Yes, sir?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.020
- I'll have an apple martini

05:43.600 --> 05:45.326
and a cheese toaster.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.153
Thank you.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.920
- A man should watch his back

05:58.920 --> 06:01.280
at a party he's not invited to.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.583
- Back off, knucklehead.

06:04.870 --> 06:05.703
- Well now,

06:07.250 --> 06:11.100
talk about going from scared
to horny in five seconds.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.690
- Oh, you should still be scared, Mr --

06:13.690 --> 06:15.990
- Mann, Logan Mann.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.720
- We know who you are.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.350
No one else would have the balls

06:20.350 --> 06:22.163
to walk into the tiger's den.

06:23.900 --> 06:27.040
- I think you'll find it's
called the lion's den.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.613
- No this place is called The Tiger's Den.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.513
- So it is.

06:34.690 --> 06:38.685
Well, I stand corrected Ms. Volk.

06:49.559 --> 06:53.747
- Monica, what do I do
with this vase again?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.513
- Pop it on the side
there, point it at the bed.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.063
- Where's the camera, though?

06:59.063 --> 07:00.010
I can't even see it.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.430
- Yeah well, you're not
supposed to, are ya?

07:01.430 --> 07:03.193
It's hidden inside, you gunk!

07:13.860 --> 07:14.960
- Hi, Anne.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.730
- Oh, hi Graham.

07:16.730 --> 07:17.583
I was wondering,

07:19.060 --> 07:22.993
when you get back do you
fancy maybe grabbing a drink?

07:24.850 --> 07:25.683
- Yeah!

07:25.683 --> 07:27.523
I mean, no, no, yeah, no, yeah.

07:27.523 --> 07:30.500
I mean, that sounds like the invite

07:30.500 --> 07:32.183
of a lifetime if I'm honest.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.740
Shit, shit, gotta go,
gotta go, Anne, sorry.

07:38.677 --> 07:41.410
Monica, incoming incoming
two bogies, incoming!

07:41.410 --> 07:45.030
- Shit. Fuck!

07:45.030 --> 07:46.613
We need to hide, quick!

07:48.510 --> 07:49.770
- I love hide and seek!

07:49.770 --> 07:50.880
This is my game, you know.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.130
You know, this one time, I was hiding,

07:53.130 --> 07:56.130
and to this very day,
they've never found me!

07:56.130 --> 07:59.472
- Right, don't you think they
just stopped looking for ya?

07:59.472 --> 08:00.323
Now listen, you get under that bed

08:00.323 --> 08:01.800
and you do not fucking breathe

08:01.800 --> 08:04.091
or I swear, Dan, I will
fucking smother you!

08:31.237 --> 08:33.570
- Tonight has been nice, eh?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.283
- It's been a perfect night, just perfect.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.840
But,

08:40.840 --> 08:41.673
Sergei,

08:43.290 --> 08:44.887
I can't do this.

08:44.887 --> 08:46.220
- You can't do what?

08:46.220 --> 08:47.920
- Even when everything is perfect,

08:50.060 --> 08:53.962
being with you just,
it doesn't feel right.

08:53.962 --> 08:55.603
- Did you make this decision?

08:57.380 --> 08:58.520
My whole life,

08:59.390 --> 09:04.390
you have been the most beautiful
person I have ever met!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.313
- Stop.

09:08.696 --> 09:10.647
- I've always loved you!

09:10.647 --> 09:13.384
And you can love me again.

09:13.384 --> 09:14.448
- Sergei, stop.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.000
I love Borisco.

09:18.946 --> 09:19.779
- Borisco?

09:21.933 --> 09:22.766
Borisco?

09:23.878 --> 09:25.128
The bee-keeper?

09:27.180 --> 09:30.223
- Look, I just need some time.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.790
We need to get back to the party.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.658
- Don't touch me!
- Give me a hug.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.933
- Don't touch me, cheating pig!

09:37.933 --> 09:40.516
.

09:43.253 --> 09:45.073
- It's a funny old thing, Miss Volk.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.930
Usually after this amount of flirting

09:47.930 --> 09:50.427
I can usually rustle up at least a kiss.

09:53.643 --> 09:55.260
- There are too many eyes here.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.480
I have an apartment across the road.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.380
Count to a thousand and join me there.

10:08.030 --> 10:13.030
- One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi,

10:13.790 --> 10:18.790
four Mississippi, five
Mississippi, six Mississippi,

10:19.810 --> 10:24.810
seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,

10:25.160 --> 10:27.418
nine Mississippi.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.880
- What took you so long?

10:48.880 --> 10:51.475
- I'm sorry. I was waiting for a toastie.

10:51.475 --> 10:52.548
- How was it?

10:52.548 --> 10:53.733
Cheesy.

10:56.388 --> 10:58.050
- Surprise!

10:58.050 --> 11:00.833
I am not what or who you think I am.

11:05.214 --> 11:06.210
- Whoa, now.

11:06.210 --> 11:10.630
- Looks like a little fly has
landed in the spider's web.

11:11.886 --> 11:14.301
The famous Logan Mann of Action Team.

11:14.301 --> 11:17.030
Secret agent, killer, lover.

11:17.030 --> 11:20.913
- Wow, licking me and biting,
I feel like an ice cream!

11:24.350 --> 11:26.027
- I am a slippery agent, Mr. Mann.

11:26.027 --> 11:27.750
You didn't see that coming, huh?

11:27.750 --> 11:28.717
- Well, you say that

11:28.717 --> 11:30.543
but it's quite common for a lot of people

11:30.543 --> 11:32.910
in this industry not to
be who they say they are.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.480
There's an awful lot of lying.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.660
- I have been deep undercover

11:35.660 --> 11:38.200
in Schevchenko's
organization for many years.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.190
We've become lovers.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.190
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.190 --> 11:41.771
- Originally I was
working for the Russians,

11:41.771 --> 11:43.229
the FSB

11:43.229 --> 11:45.126
but I don't trust them any more.

11:45.126 --> 11:46.534
I don't trust anyone!

11:47.719 --> 11:49.370
- I didn't really need
your whole back story.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.383
I kind of only need the bits
about Vladimir Schevchenko

11:52.383 --> 11:54.350
and what his next move is.

11:54.350 --> 11:56.300
- Enough talking, Mr Mann.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.533
Make love to me.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.370
- Oh, you are deceptively
strong, Miss Volk!

12:01.370 --> 12:02.853
I must commend you on that.

12:02.853 --> 12:04.640
Hey, just slow down!

12:04.640 --> 12:05.900
What if we just chat?

12:05.900 --> 12:07.010
Let's just have a chat.

12:07.010 --> 12:08.550
Or maybe a cuddle?

12:08.550 --> 12:11.067
And just all get to know each other.

12:11.067 --> 12:13.734
.

12:15.390 --> 12:17.493
Hello.

12:19.857 --> 12:21.150
Ah, Jesus!

12:21.150 --> 12:22.370
Ow!

12:22.370 --> 12:23.203
Ah! What are you doing?

12:23.203 --> 12:24.233
That's my nose!

12:26.687 --> 12:29.343
- Agent, you are going to
have to penetrate the target.

12:30.740 --> 12:31.573
- What are you doing?

12:31.573 --> 12:32.500
Just getting a rubber Johnny.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.350
You know, a good agent
always carries protection.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.617
- Oh, yes of course.

12:57.696 --> 12:58.540
- What's the matter?

12:58.540 --> 13:01.190
- The little fellow's just
not standing to attention.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.300
- Hey, slow down, slow down!

13:04.300 --> 13:05.570
You're gonna pull it off.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.518
- Agent, take control of the situation.

13:07.518 --> 13:08.572
- I'm trying.

13:08.572 --> 13:10.590
- You want me to talk dirty to you?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.770
- Yeah, yeah, go for it, go for it.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.025
Push it out. Push it-- Aghh!

13:15.260 --> 13:18.350
You make me sick, you sniveling troll pig!

13:18.350 --> 13:19.670
- Troll pig, that hurts my feelings.

13:19.670 --> 13:21.020
I feel hurt by that.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.174
- Do you want me to lick your armpits?

13:22.174 --> 13:24.820
- Come on, who even are you?

13:24.820 --> 13:26.650
- I'm running out of ideas!

13:26.650 --> 13:27.900
- This has never happened to me before!

13:27.900 --> 13:29.030
- You know what?

13:29.030 --> 13:30.330
Take a chill pill.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.203
Take it down a notch or eight!

13:33.260 --> 13:35.210
- Right, has anybody got any advice?

13:35.210 --> 13:36.630
- Hey how many people
are watching this thing?

13:36.630 --> 13:37.770
- We need this information.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.850
Does anybody have any suggestions at all?

13:39.850 --> 13:41.341
- Could try sticking a finger up his bum.

13:41.341 --> 13:42.850
- What was that?

13:42.850 --> 13:44.129
- It stimulates the prostate.

13:44.129 --> 13:46.270
- Is that my biscuits?

13:46.270 --> 13:47.410
- Logan, did you get that?

13:47.410 --> 13:48.960
Try sticking your finger up your bum.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.940
- I am not doing that.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.020
That's disgusting!

13:52.020 --> 13:53.773
- Stick your finger up your bum, agent.

13:53.773 --> 13:55.873
There must be something I can do, tell me!

13:56.839 --> 14:00.890
There is one thing you could try.

14:02.188 --> 14:03.953
- Is that nice?

14:03.953 --> 14:05.360
- Not so deep.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.287
Pull it out a bit.

14:07.195 --> 14:08.795
You've got long old nails, so --

14:10.394 --> 14:12.700
.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.533
Oh, God.

14:14.710 --> 14:16.453
Oh, yeah, you feel that wood, huh?

14:32.349 --> 14:35.349
- Logan, I have the antelope's tail.

14:36.485 --> 14:38.078
- Antelope's tail?

14:38.078 --> 14:40.060
- It is a mysterious digital device.

14:40.060 --> 14:44.065
They say that owning it is
the key to global power.

14:44.065 --> 14:46.643
And Vlad is using me
on the penultimate leg

14:46.643 --> 14:49.430
as mule to transport
the device into Russia.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.890
I'll be boarding the20
train from Poduyane station.

14:52.890 --> 14:57.030
I will have the device disguised
as a gift for my nephew.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.873
I will be accompanied by
two other close associates.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.480
If you can take care of them,

15:03.545 --> 15:05.910
then you can make the
escape with the device

15:05.910 --> 15:08.437
before the final station
at the Romanian border.

15:09.387 --> 15:13.070
And then you might just save the world.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.150
- Oh, I'll save it, all right.

15:14.150 --> 15:15.004
I will save it!

15:15.004 --> 15:15.837
- Shh!

15:19.608 --> 15:20.470
- You haven't washed your finger

15:20.470 --> 15:22.241
since you stuck it up my ass.

15:22.241 --> 15:23.241
- Oh, sorry.

15:24.693 --> 15:27.063
- Yeah, it's on the end of my nose.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.227
Yeah, go and have a wash.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.550
- Poduyane Station.

15:30.550 --> 15:31.593
- I'll be there.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.427
.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.763
- Let's kick this thing in the dick.

15:45.763 --> 15:48.143
- Roger that preparing to board.

15:56.199 --> 15:57.760
- Whoa!

15:57.760 --> 15:59.350
Is that you on the roof, Guv?

15:59.350 --> 16:01.010
It's fast, it is fast!

16:02.661 --> 16:04.911
.

16:07.544 --> 16:09.843
- Are you going to ignore me all day?

16:09.843 --> 16:12.570
- I'm not ignoring you, baby.

16:12.570 --> 16:13.813
I'm just doing my job.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.543
- Why didn't you just
do your job at breakfast

16:20.543 --> 16:22.053
when I was eating all alone?

16:23.600 --> 16:25.150
- You're going to do this here?

16:26.476 --> 16:28.537
You're kidding me right now.

16:36.350 --> 16:40.517
- You know, I don't even
know who you are anymore.

16:48.810 --> 16:50.727
- You should go to him.

16:56.939 --> 16:58.524
- Monica!

16:58.524 --> 17:01.191
.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.680
- Hi, Rebekkah.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.370
- You need to come now.

17:10.370 --> 17:11.851
You need to come now!

17:11.851 --> 17:13.493
- Monica, it's me.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.790
You need to get to Volk
as soon as you can.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.597
Get to Volk.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.503
Hold on, it's Samantha!

17:21.628 --> 17:22.970
Hey, baby!

17:22.970 --> 17:26.141
- Hi, sorry, is this a bad time?

17:26.141 --> 17:29.220
Oh, no, no it's a perfect time!

17:29.220 --> 17:31.360
- Was everything okay with your grandma?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.998
Did you find her parakeet?

17:35.976 --> 17:38.060
Are you feeling okay?

17:38.060 --> 17:39.900
Are you feeling --

17:39.900 --> 17:41.780
- Oh, um, hello?

17:41.780 --> 17:42.613
- Samantha!

17:47.691 --> 17:48.540
- I'm on my way, boss man.

17:48.540 --> 17:49.490
You in position?

17:49.490 --> 17:51.046
- No that's a negative.

17:51.046 --> 17:55.686
I haven't moved from this spot.

17:56.519 --> 17:57.352
Excuse me.

17:57.352 --> 17:58.580
In a bit of a rush all right step aside.

17:58.580 --> 17:59.413
You have ticket?

17:59.413 --> 18:00.246
- No, no, no.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.830
No ticket I'm a spy.

18:01.830 --> 18:02.663
- No ticket, no train.

18:02.663 --> 18:04.440
- No, you're not listening to me, yeah?

18:04.440 --> 18:06.829
Saving world, world saving?

18:06.829 --> 18:08.617
Penalty, penalty, 400 penalty.

18:08.617 --> 18:09.784
Do me a favor!

18:17.982 --> 18:18.815
Bastard.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.520
- Am I doing all right?

18:26.520 --> 18:28.435
- No, good, no, you're doing okay.

18:28.435 --> 18:31.959
Have you had much experience
in an all-terrain vehicle?

18:31.959 --> 18:34.684
- Uh, well, not exactly but

18:34.684 --> 18:36.810
I've been learning it in a Micro.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.700
Okay okay, well it's pretty
much the same principle.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.260
This obviously has a
little bit more muscle

18:41.260 --> 18:42.990
than your average Micro.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.714
You've got your hands ten to two.

18:44.714 --> 18:46.450
Lovely, well done.

18:46.450 --> 18:47.520
And when the train comes,

18:47.520 --> 18:50.980
we're gonna have to give it
a little bit more gas, okay?

18:50.980 --> 18:51.922
That's the train.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.982
So you need to...

18:55.982 --> 18:56.973
- Shall I go faster now?

18:56.973 --> 18:58.325
- Yeah, foot to the metal please, mate.

19:06.510 --> 19:07.940
- Who are you?

19:07.940 --> 19:09.090
- I'm with Action Team.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.863
Believe I'll be needing this.

19:17.162 --> 19:18.547
Chao.

19:23.261 --> 19:25.511
- Did someone order a hero?

19:28.408 --> 19:30.684
- Nah, nah, we're all right, mate.

19:30.684 --> 19:32.434
Let's crack on, yeah?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.600
- Logan Mann I will always be

19:37.600 --> 19:40.158
in all of the shadows.

19:40.158 --> 19:42.658
- Listen Rebekkah, I gotta go.

19:45.236 --> 19:48.069
.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.330
- What the...

20:14.330 --> 20:15.163
Dammit!

20:15.163 --> 20:15.996
- Why?

20:17.002 --> 20:18.420
- Listen to me.

20:18.420 --> 20:22.670
The only people that knew what we knew,

20:22.670 --> 20:24.770
that we knew what we knew,

20:24.770 --> 20:27.930
are the people watching
me and Volk make love

20:27.930 --> 20:29.407
in that bedroom last night.

20:29.407 --> 20:31.610
- I'm just gonna call it as I see it.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.190
We got ourselves a mole.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.832
- Or Volk double-crossed us.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.963
- Get off me!

20:44.250 --> 20:45.377
- Where is Alesky?

20:47.066 --> 20:48.288
- We broke up.

20:50.363 --> 20:52.360
- Borisco the bee-keeper?

20:52.360 --> 20:53.193
Really?

20:55.466 --> 20:56.840
Where is the package?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.673
- I'm sorry, but we got ambushed.

20:58.673 --> 20:59.853
I don't have package.

21:01.730 --> 21:03.803
- See I am not as stupid

21:05.157 --> 21:07.722
as you like to know.

21:07.722 --> 21:09.942
- My darling, I never think you're stupid.

21:09.942 --> 21:12.100
- Enough!

21:12.100 --> 21:15.353
Stop pissing on my face
and telling me it rains!

21:16.660 --> 21:18.050
- Please I love you!

21:19.016 --> 21:19.849
I love you!

21:19.849 --> 21:20.682
- No.

21:21.707 --> 21:23.207
I know you had sex with Logan.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.263
- How do you think that makes me feel?

21:29.470 --> 21:32.849
When we've been going
steady for two semesters

21:32.849 --> 21:35.684
and I don't even get to second base!

21:35.684 --> 21:38.180
Just a little bit of top half only.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.894
Only touch my boobies.

21:39.894 --> 21:43.000
And then you stick your finger up his ass?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.152
- I like the sound of that!

21:45.152 --> 21:46.913
- No, Rengard, no, not now.

21:49.660 --> 21:51.211
Take her away to Tin mines.

21:51.211 --> 21:52.440
- Oh, no. No, no, no!

21:52.440 --> 21:53.273
Not the Tin mines!

21:53.273 --> 21:54.106
No.

21:54.106 --> 21:57.539
I love you please, no.

21:57.539 --> 21:59.385
Sergei, come.

22:11.218 --> 22:13.885
.
