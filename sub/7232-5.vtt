10:02.393 --> 10:05.021
- WAIT.
"WILL SUBMIT PROJECT LATER"?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.522
- IT IS 1/3 OF MY GRADE.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.816
I MUST STAY
AND REDO MY REPORT

10:08.899 --> 10:10.401
WITH HUMANS THIS TIME.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.694
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D ALLOW AN ALIEN

10:11.777 --> 10:15.197
TO RUN WILLY-NILLY
OVER MY TERRA FIRMA?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.742

10:29.712 --> 10:31.714
- WE'RE BRINGING IN
ANOTHER ALIEN?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.799
- I LIKE TO KEEP
MY FRIENDS CLOSE

10:33.883 --> 10:35.134
AND MY ALIENS CLOSER.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.219

A BEST FRIEND.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.949
I SHOULD KNOW THIS

12:44.597 --> 12:45.473
I MEAN, SOMETIMES
IT JUST DOES STUFF

12:45.556 --> 12:47.850

BAD MOUTH!

12:50.644 --> 12:53.689

12:59.278 --> 13:00.696
OF CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.823
- 100% CHANCE OF DON'T CARE.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.867
- I MERELY WISH
TO RECORD THE RESULTS

13:04.950 --> 13:06.285

15:09.867 --> 15:11.827
- YEAH, MAYBE IT'S
MY EARTH INTELLIGENCE,

15:11.910 --> 15:13.495
BUT ON THIS PLANET,
EDUCATIONAL TV

15:13.579 --> 15:14.997
MEANS PUPPETS
TEACHING THE ALPHABET
