WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:03.046
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.092
KYLE:
"There are things in Careyes

00:05.135 --> 00:07.137
you'd find interesting."

00:07.181 --> 00:09.226
Did Alex ever determine
if Jones was able

00:09.270 --> 00:10.488
to send a transmission

00:10.532 --> 00:11.881
through the Lockhart machine?

00:11.924 --> 00:13.056
TEZCA:
This is what our Triad

00:13.100 --> 00:14.318
is meant to do.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.363
Something we've waited

00:15.406 --> 00:16.973
a long time to reap.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.366
The alighting.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.063
We have been working nonstop

00:20.107 --> 00:22.196
since we crawled out of our pod
six months ago.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.894
MAX:
There's two aliens
terrorizing Roswell right now

00:24.937 --> 00:26.069
and a third
who's God knows where.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.940
I ran into Bonnie at the Pony.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.726
Think she's more lost soul
than evil dictator.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.642
They are pieces
of a larger puzzle.MICHAEL: All that's missing

00:33.685 --> 00:35.818
is that piece from
West Pecos Bank and Trust.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.776
And when you retrieve it
you'll be able to see

00:37.820 --> 00:40.083
what this skilled piece
of engineering can do.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
Oh, my God. Cam! Cam.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.391
Where's Evans?

00:43.434 --> 00:45.175
Cam. You shot?

00:45.219 --> 00:48.135
You got to heal me.
[sharp inhale]

00:48.178 --> 00:50.441
Have you always had blue eyes?

00:50.485 --> 00:53.183
How long you had that tattoo?
You're not Cam, are you?

00:57.100 --> 01:00.103
I'm not.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.326
You can put the gun down, Max.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.676
I want to talk to you.All the same,

01:07.719 --> 01:09.243
I'd feel better keeping it up.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.116
But the control

01:13.160 --> 01:15.336
you think it gives you is
an illusion.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.555
You went through an awful lot
of trouble to steal Jones' body.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.948
So what's the plan?

01:18.991 --> 01:20.515
Gonna use me to
bring him back,

01:20.558 --> 01:21.951
give him a new lease on life?

01:21.994 --> 01:23.953
In order to embrace
a new reality,

01:23.996 --> 01:27.609
it's helpful if a teacher can
assess where a student's level

01:27.652 --> 01:29.524
currently rests.You're no teacher.

01:29.567 --> 01:33.267
But I know so much about
our world and your place in it.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.530
What else would I be to you?

01:35.573 --> 01:38.010
You're not the only one
who knows things.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.187
See, I know that Jones used
the Lockhart machine

01:40.230 --> 01:42.319
to call y'all down here
six months ago.

01:42.363 --> 01:45.409
And I know you're here to finish
what he set in motion.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.498
Clever clone.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.935
Jones set things in motion, yes.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.764
Plans changed
since our savior's dead.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.289
But it doesn't mean
he doesn't serve a purpose.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.122
It's coming along nicely.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.996
[gasps]This flame is
the flame

02:07.039 --> 02:08.998
of the Savior.[choking]

02:09.041 --> 02:10.956
Jones had it and you have it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.002
[choking]:
That didn't come from me.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.091
Oh, I assure you
it did.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.138
Our psychic connection
merely allows me to borrow it.

02:18.181 --> 02:21.663
But today you'll learn
to harness it on your own.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.317
I'll show you

02:23.360 --> 02:26.015
who you were meant to become.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.063
Rest now.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.327
The torch has been passed.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.289
[metallic ringing][groaning]

02:43.337 --> 02:45.382
â™ª

02:50.082 --> 02:51.171
LIZ:
Hey. Oh, my God.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.216
We were worried. I...

02:53.260 --> 02:54.957
I was worried.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.176
I'm so sorry.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.090
I'm okay.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.834
Cam, I'm glad you're here.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.230
Hey.How you holding up?

03:07.274 --> 03:08.536
Oh, I, uh,

03:08.579 --> 03:10.277
feel like a donkey kicked me.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.801
But on the bright side,
I have a pair of blue eyes

03:12.844 --> 03:15.064
that could put Sinatra's
to shame, so...

03:15.107 --> 03:17.632
I thought maybe the
shape-shifter found you, too.She did.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.155
She calls herself Tezca.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.548
When I got away,
I went for a walk

03:20.591 --> 03:23.377
on Old Sutter's property
to clear my head.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.161
She have Jones's body?Yeah. At first,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.989
I thought she was gonna try
and resurrect him, but...

03:27.032 --> 03:28.817
but she conjured fire

03:28.860 --> 03:31.385
and burned his body
right in front of me.Strange.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.125
But good, right?

03:33.169 --> 03:34.126
I-I don't know.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.693
I mean...

03:35.737 --> 03:39.001
when I healed Tezca,
I thought it was Cam.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
LIZ:
Wait. So you're connected

03:40.524 --> 03:42.222
to her through
the handprint?
Mm-hmm.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.180
Okay, we have to break
the tether immediately, Max.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.443
I don't know. I mean, I think
I'll just stay away from her

03:46.487 --> 03:47.662
till the print fades.I'm sorry,

03:47.705 --> 03:49.490
are you not worried about this?

03:49.533 --> 03:51.448
'Cause I'm definitely worried
about this.
No.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.710
I mean, she didn't
want to kill me.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.364
She just wanted to talk.Max...

03:54.408 --> 03:57.237
Look, what I'm worried
about right now is Cam.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.716
All right?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.414
I mean, is there
something you can do?

04:01.415 --> 04:04.461
Yeah, yeah. I will make sure
that the alien DNA

04:04.505 --> 04:06.289
is no longer in Cam's system,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.117
so she has
no dangerous side effects.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.988
MICHAEL: While you're
whipping up that alien remedy,

04:10.032 --> 04:12.730
I think we should extend
the courtesy to Eduardo.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.732
Does that mean you
know where he is?

04:14.776 --> 04:17.822
Because the version I saw was
of the Lost Highway variety.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.695
I found him tied up at
Bonnie and Clyde's last night.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.523
But he told me
he would be able to escape,

04:22.566 --> 04:23.480
so I assume that he did.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.134
You left him there?

04:25.177 --> 04:26.309
He convinced me it was
the right thing to do.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.702
If he's still missing,

04:27.745 --> 04:29.312
then we should go find him.MAX: Agreed.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.661
Why don't you and I
get that squared away?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.228
All right? Liz,
can I leave you here

04:32.272 --> 04:33.751
to science up Cam?

04:33.795 --> 04:34.578
Mm-hmm.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.232
All right.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.026
[sighs]

04:48.070 --> 04:50.028
Dr. Valenti,
you are needed in the O.R.

04:50.072 --> 04:53.118
to perform a solo surgery
on a woman

04:53.162 --> 04:55.512
floating in a pod.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.124
[door unlocking]

05:07.655 --> 05:09.700
I'm sorry,
is that a butter knife?

05:09.744 --> 05:12.834
Uh, it was a... d-dagger.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.184
What are you doing here, Iz?

05:15.227 --> 05:16.577
You know, I couldn't shake
the feeling that, uh,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.187
what we found
in Eduardo's office

05:18.230 --> 05:19.710
might help connect the dots
in Roswell, so...

05:19.754 --> 05:22.583
So you just hopped on a plane
to Mexico?

05:22.626 --> 05:25.368
Yes. And then I mindscaped
a very helpful manager

05:25.412 --> 05:27.065
at your family's distillery.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.719
Speaking of which,
I'm absolutely parched.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.243
I think it might be time
for a little bebida.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.116
We may have to hold off
on the margaritas.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.425
Oh, my God.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.818
Can't drink
before surgery.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.344
And I'm gonna need
you to scrub in.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.432
Um...

05:45.475 --> 05:48.348
Welcome toCareyes.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.699
[creaking nearby]

05:52.700 --> 05:54.919
MARIA:
Shouldn't you have a...

05:54.963 --> 05:57.226
alien spotter
for this kind of exercise?

05:59.446 --> 06:01.012
Ah, thank you.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.624
What type of angry angst
are you working out?

06:03.667 --> 06:06.409
Well, uh, these reps
are less about angst

06:06.453 --> 06:08.411
and more about the reps.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.196
Last time I was flexing
my alien muscles,

06:11.240 --> 06:14.939
I triggered a memory of me
and my father when I was a kid.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.422
He had this necklace on.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.250
It's a triquetra.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.252
The Christians used it
to symbolize the Holy Trinity.

06:23.295 --> 06:24.993
You saying Jesus was an alien?

06:25.036 --> 06:27.430
No, I'm saying that...

06:27.474 --> 06:29.693
I think this memory was
on Earth.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.303
How is that possible?

06:31.347 --> 06:32.827
I don't know.
That's why I-I'm trying

06:32.870 --> 06:34.176
to trigger another memory,

06:34.219 --> 06:35.699
you know,
shed some light, but...

06:35.743 --> 06:36.961
so far no dice.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.136
Let me see.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.097
I've seen this symbol before.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.230
In the abandoned
Revivalist Church

06:45.274 --> 06:47.450
off Range Road 421.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.452
May be worth

06:49.496 --> 06:51.280
a trip.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.022
MICHAEL:
So...

06:54.065 --> 06:56.067
what are you
hiding from Liz?

06:56.111 --> 06:58.287
'Cause I could
feel you humming.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
And you're lucky that
Miss Centrifuge cannot.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.465
Do you tell Alex everything
that's going on with you?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
I was trained in the
art of trust issues

07:04.380 --> 07:06.338
for 20-some years,
Max, so, no...

07:06.382 --> 07:08.776
I do not.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.691
But I regret it

07:10.734 --> 07:13.476
every single time
I don't let him in.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
Well, when I tried
to propose to Liz,

07:15.347 --> 07:17.480
she told me that,
uh, she was worried

07:17.524 --> 07:20.265
about when the next alien threat
would come knocking on her door,

07:20.309 --> 07:22.180
when the next shoe
would drop.

07:22.224 --> 07:25.140
And I don't know how to tell her
that I think I'm the shoe.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.838
Gonna need you to use
more words here.

07:27.882 --> 07:30.798
When my handprint formed on her,
Tezca was able to...

07:30.841 --> 07:32.495
access abilities

07:32.539 --> 07:34.497
I didn't even
know I had.
What abilities?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.195
Was a blue flame--
she used it to burn Jones' body.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.633
Oh, she said I had no choice
but to evolve

07:39.676 --> 07:42.853
and that it was her mission
to make sure that happened.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.247
[sighs]

07:45.290 --> 07:46.466
[choking]

07:47.249 --> 07:49.164
Max. Hey!

07:49.207 --> 07:50.644
[grunts]

07:57.389 --> 07:59.914
Hello again.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.835
This is my mindscape, isn't it?

08:07.878 --> 08:09.880
Well, given our
current bond,

08:09.924 --> 08:12.796
I'd more accurately describe
it as ourmindscape.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.232
Aren't you
curious at all

08:14.276 --> 08:16.365
what else you're capable of?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.062
I'm fine with who I am.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.673
You're not.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.370
How are you enjoying Cam's skin?

08:21.413 --> 08:23.851
I found it fitting
for our lesson.

08:23.894 --> 08:27.376
She was your partner
once, wasn't she?

08:27.419 --> 08:29.683
A trusted confidant?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.989
Someone who could call you
on your lies?

08:32.033 --> 08:33.817
You see, I
don't think

08:33.861 --> 08:36.167
you are fine with who you are.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.039
I can feel it.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.997
Speaking of,

08:40.041 --> 08:41.521
can you feel this?

08:41.564 --> 08:42.739
[high-pitched ringing]

08:42.783 --> 08:44.001
[grunts]

08:44.045 --> 08:45.176
Stop!

08:45.220 --> 08:46.874
[grunting]
I can't breathe.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.440
I'm squeezing
your organs

08:48.484 --> 08:49.964
from the inside.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
Nudging them
to secrete

08:51.618 --> 08:54.011
the enzymes necessary
for your evolution.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.231
[grunting]
I'm forcing
your nerves,

08:56.274 --> 08:58.146
your muscles,

08:58.189 --> 09:02.106
your mind to awaken in ways
you could never imagine.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.499
And you will have

09:03.543 --> 09:05.588
the power to change everything.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.459
MICHAEL:
Max! Hey!

09:07.503 --> 09:08.765
Max, come on! Max!

09:10.071 --> 09:11.855
[relieved exhale]

09:12.813 --> 09:14.423
What happened?

09:14.466 --> 09:16.251
Tezca pulled me
into my mindscape.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.905
Well, you don't even have
that ability.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.341
I've seen you try.
Your face looks...She's claiming

09:19.384 --> 09:20.951
I'm capable of more.

09:20.995 --> 09:24.172
Yeah, she's telling me
that it doesn't matter

09:24.215 --> 09:25.826
what I do to try and evade her.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.479
Liars lie, Max.

09:27.523 --> 09:28.829
Not this time.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.831
No, man, I can feel her
waking things up

09:30.874 --> 09:32.746
that have always
been dormant.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.574
Whatever we thought
we could manage with them,

09:34.617 --> 09:36.271
we can't.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.229
I mean, I-I don't think
you should keep playing

09:38.273 --> 09:40.405
undercover cop.I'm making headway
with Bonnie and Clyde.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.146
Really?
Do you have any idea

09:42.190 --> 09:43.931
what they stole from the
other security deposit boxes?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.629
I'm working on it.So there's no guarantee
that Tezca

09:46.673 --> 09:48.979
won't let me do something
I can't take back before then?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.415
Yeah, but I'm close.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.069
If you give me
the Octahedron,

09:52.113 --> 09:54.028
I know I can convince them
to tell me what it does.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.595
Bad idea.Yes.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.596
It's all a bad idea.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.597
But it's the idea

09:57.640 --> 09:58.946
that we got.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.350
You, though, you need to go
home and talk to your girl.

10:12.394 --> 10:15.658
I'll find Eduardo, figure out
what this glow cube does.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.008
Go team?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.838
Go team.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.580
I'm sorry.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.451
I'm sure this sucks.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.540
And, spoiler alert, I do
not have a lollipop for you

10:28.584 --> 10:30.368
when I am done.[laughs softly]

10:30.412 --> 10:32.675
Oh, I, uh,
don't need a lollipop

10:32.719 --> 10:34.895
when I already feel
like a sucker.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.418
Why do you think

10:36.461 --> 10:37.680
Max is lying to us?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.377
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.901
I don't get it.
You see this path

10:40.944 --> 10:44.078
through all this
complicated alien DNA stuff,

10:44.121 --> 10:45.166
but you're unwilling

10:45.209 --> 10:46.689
to call your boyfriend out

10:46.733 --> 10:48.212
when he's being
a closed-off dumbass?

10:48.256 --> 10:51.694
Max is only going to tell me
when he's ready.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.175
We trust each other.
I'm not gonna ruin that.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.699
I'm not telling you
to read his diary.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.266
And I think that Max

10:58.309 --> 11:01.138
is a mule,
and sometimes you just gotta...

11:01.182 --> 11:03.140
give him a kick to make him go.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.534
Max and I don't kick each other.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.189
He's got to come
to his own decisions.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.975
And if you want that
parasitic alien gone,

11:12.019 --> 11:15.196
then I got to go run this
through the lab at Senovative.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.502
All right.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.549
[door opens]

11:21.768 --> 11:23.421
[door closes]

11:24.422 --> 11:25.859
She should be out for a while.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.035
So that's our, uh, what...

11:28.078 --> 11:30.211
second successful
surgery? Sound right?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.779
[chuckles]
And I'd say
that's two too many.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.302
But...

11:34.345 --> 11:35.912
thank you for your help.

11:35.956 --> 11:39.611
You're just lucky
I had a craving for... menudo.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.483
Quips aside,

11:41.526 --> 11:42.614
tell me,

11:42.658 --> 11:44.051
why are you here?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.402
Yeah. I, uh...

11:47.445 --> 11:50.622
I finally mustered up
the courage to talk to Anatsa,

11:50.666 --> 11:52.624
and...

11:52.668 --> 11:55.627
she didn't really want
to listen.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.021
And honestly, I can't
blame her, 'cause it's

11:58.065 --> 12:00.545
not the first time
that I have...

12:00.589 --> 12:03.897
lied about who I am to someone
that I've claimed to love.

12:03.940 --> 12:07.117
Only, of course, this time I
actually had someone who was...

12:07.161 --> 12:09.076
worthy of my honestly.
[sighs]

12:09.119 --> 12:12.253
But instead of telling
her the truth, I just...

12:12.296 --> 12:15.343
drove the only good relationship
I've ever had right off a cliff.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.128
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Isobel.

12:18.172 --> 12:21.218
Yeah, it's...

12:21.262 --> 12:23.046
Anyway...
[sniffles]

12:23.090 --> 12:24.526
it's good.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.789
Honestly, I just,
I needed to leave Roswell,

12:26.833 --> 12:30.358
uh, just get
a little perspective.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.318
It's a relief being around you.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
[sighs]:
Uh...

12:40.194 --> 12:43.632
I-I wish I could, uh,
get some more perspective

12:43.675 --> 12:45.765
on our pod patient.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.640
I might have an idea.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.907
I think this casita's owned
by your family.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.176
[exhales]

13:12.182 --> 13:14.402
You looking for someone?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.498
I was looking for you.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.282
And then I, uh...

13:25.326 --> 13:26.675
saw the rope.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.590
What happened?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.505
We were holding
a loose end.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.767
Did they get away?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.464
Bonnie was tasked
with making sure

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
he didn't get away
from anything.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.207
Well, why not just...

13:37.251 --> 13:38.774
mind-wipe him?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.863
I wasn't the one
who decided his fate.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.386
But regardless,

13:42.430 --> 13:44.780
Bonnie should have been back
hours ago.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.260
What do you think happened
to them?

13:46.303 --> 13:48.436
As part of her Triad,
I can feel her.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.654
She's...

13:49.698 --> 13:51.482
she's conflicted,

13:51.526 --> 13:53.658
angry, scared.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.835
But I can't tell
if there's a physical cause.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.880
Bonnie is powerful
but unpredictable,

13:57.924 --> 13:59.490
and without guidance,

13:59.534 --> 14:01.318
unpredictable things tend
to happen.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.452
Well, shall we stop wasting
fresh air and go find her?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.718
I don't care whose son you are.

14:09.761 --> 14:13.026
If your little chats with
Bonnie hurt her in any way,

14:13.069 --> 14:14.810
I will destroy you.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.073
[whispers]:
All I want to do is help.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.208
Then come with me.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.908
See, on the night
you crashed,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.562
it says that
otherworldly objects

14:27.605 --> 14:29.216
started falling
from the sky.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.608
So, when they saw
what was happening,

14:30.652 --> 14:31.914
they collected
everything they could

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
and they brought it here,

14:34.047 --> 14:37.006
to a casita they named
after the Aztec word for "star."

14:37.050 --> 14:38.616
Xitlali.Mm-hmm.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.531
And then they
charged themselves

14:40.575 --> 14:42.272
with protecting
the artifacts

14:42.316 --> 14:44.535
until the Sky Gods
came back for it.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.276
Hmm.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.104
Look at this.Hmm?

14:48.148 --> 14:50.977
Alma. That's,
uh, Hector's wife.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.110
This must have been written
after the night of the crash.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.025
Apparently, after what
happened there that night,

14:56.069 --> 14:58.027
the Valentis in Roswell
decided to cut communication

14:58.071 --> 14:59.942
with their family
in Careyes.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.944
They wanted to make
sure to protect

15:01.988 --> 15:03.903
anything
extraterrestrial

15:03.946 --> 15:06.949
from falling
into the wrong hands.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.213
Kyle. Your family

15:10.257 --> 15:13.782
has been protecting my family
for the last 75 years.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.827
You know what this
means, right?

15:16.828 --> 15:18.352
[chuckles]

15:18.395 --> 15:20.093
[awkward chuckle]

15:20.136 --> 15:25.011
Uh, this is a, uh,
log of every Valenti

15:25.054 --> 15:27.143
who's lived
at Xitlali ever since.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.536
Huh.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.407
It says Sonya Valenti

15:30.451 --> 15:32.192
from Santa Fe.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.802
Santa Fe.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.456
Isn't Eduardo from Santa Fe?

15:36.892 --> 15:38.676
Has he ever mentioned
a daughter?
No.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.636
But it's not like my family
doesn't have a history of...

15:41.679 --> 15:43.681
secret daughters, so...

15:43.725 --> 15:45.205
Wh...

15:45.248 --> 15:47.076
[speaks Spanish]

15:47.120 --> 15:49.165
[speaking Spanish]

15:54.649 --> 15:57.217
Hey, can you
light these?

16:05.790 --> 16:06.878
[grunts]

16:06.922 --> 16:08.445
[exhales sharply]

16:08.489 --> 16:10.882
This is where Bonnie
comes to be alone.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.624
Her own little "wonders
of Earth" hideaway.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.148
Have you told Tezca
about this place?

16:15.191 --> 16:17.019
I know I'm hard on Bonnie
sometimes,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.803
but I'm just trying
to protect her

16:18.847 --> 16:21.197
from the worst alternative.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.547
What's the worst alternative?Doesn't matter.

16:23.591 --> 16:26.289
Once we're back on Oasis,
all this will be resolved.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.466
What's that, uh,
human saying?

16:29.510 --> 16:31.599
"The grass is greener
on the other side"?

16:31.642 --> 16:32.992
Mm.This world is

16:33.035 --> 16:35.646
bright and shiny and new.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.388
It's easy for Bonnie
to forget the...

16:38.432 --> 16:41.130
the value of home.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.697
There is plenty
of suffering here, too,

16:42.740 --> 16:45.526
but the pleasures of this world
hide it

16:45.569 --> 16:47.658
behind glamour.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.096
Humans are obsessed
with the illusion

16:50.139 --> 16:53.229
of happiness.I am intimately familiar.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.407
Growing up,
plenty of people passed on me.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.844
Take a look at a troubled kid,

16:59.888 --> 17:02.891
and they decided that
my value wasn't enough.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.678
On the Oasis,
I didn't have a home.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.898
I had to run

17:09.941 --> 17:12.335
and steal and hide.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.076
And then

17:14.120 --> 17:15.121
the, uh...

17:15.164 --> 17:16.818
Savior found me.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.255
Jones gave your life value.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.519
He gave me a
path forward.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.347
Bonnie gave me value.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.480
She never gave up

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
on her dream that
our world could change.

17:28.525 --> 17:32.051
And so, soon I just wanted
to make that dream a reality.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.096
And Oasis is

17:34.140 --> 17:36.446
not perfect.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.405
But it could be.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.453
Hey, Bonnie is enamored
with human food.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.934
MICHAEL:
And she's a big fan of music.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.634
Hmm.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.593
You check the grub trucks.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.856
I'll check
the second-hand instruments.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.031
Yeah.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.256
Hey.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.127
Hey.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.260
Ah, see your eyes
are still blue.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.741
I guess Liz hasn't been able to
get rid of Tezca's DNA yet, huh?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.439
Nope.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.659
But Little Miss Science
went off to the lab

18:15.703 --> 18:18.401
to mix up
my alien-freeing cocktail, so...

18:18.445 --> 18:20.273
And...

18:20.316 --> 18:23.276
now I can ask you why the hell
you showed up this morning

18:23.319 --> 18:25.843
to deliver us all
a bunch of lies?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.671
What?
And I swear
you best not give me

18:27.715 --> 18:29.064
another one.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
I left a few things out.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.766
But Tezca is the
real problem here.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.813
I would actually love
some of your Quantico insight

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
on how to take her down.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.773
Seeing as I technically
put myself

18:42.817 --> 18:46.212
on this whole "E.T. robs a bank"
thing on the sly,

18:46.255 --> 18:50.172
my boss wants my insight back
in the home office tomorrow.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.956
But...

18:52.000 --> 18:55.917
I mean, if we're talking
erasing powers,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.920
how about talking to the world's
only alien scientist...

18:58.963 --> 19:01.227
I don't want to burden Liz.Evans,

19:01.270 --> 19:03.533
we're not talking about
picking up your dry cleaning.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.970
In the history
of our relationship,

19:06.014 --> 19:08.799
Liz has always been trying
to save me.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.150
I need to be able
to save her back.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.502
Then be honest with her, Evans.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.156
What is going on, Cam?

19:17.199 --> 19:19.027
You're supposed to be
on my side.
Yeah.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.724
[groans]

19:21.856 --> 19:23.858
I am on your side.

19:23.901 --> 19:27.949
So much so that at one point...

19:27.992 --> 19:30.256
I was in love with you.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.954
And I was never honest
about that.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.435
I know we're not partners
anymore,

19:35.478 --> 19:37.132
but...

19:37.176 --> 19:40.091
I still need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.618
Don't mess this up with Liz.

19:44.661 --> 19:49.144
And don't let someone else
decide your fate for you.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.894
It feels a little less abandoned
than I thought it would.

19:59.937 --> 20:03.811
Yeah, well, in the interest
of not running into any trouble,

20:03.854 --> 20:07.902
does any of this
look familiar, or...?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.213
I think I've been here before.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.523
[child laughing]

20:20.567 --> 20:22.438
[man and child laughing]

20:26.312 --> 20:28.270
[laughter continues]

20:28.314 --> 20:30.359
MAN:
Come on.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.016
Hey, Dad.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.932
You dropped
the necklace you always wear.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.629
Oh. Thank you, son.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.544
Would have been
terrible to lose this.

20:41.588 --> 20:42.589
Why?

20:42.632 --> 20:43.938
Because this is home.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.679
I thought home was far away.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.336
The idea of home can live
in many places.

20:50.379 --> 20:51.641
Here.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.644
Here.

20:55.645 --> 20:59.040
And sometimes the very ground
beneath your feet.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.783
And I think that you've chosen
an excellent place for this.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.960
You ready?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.836
Now...

21:12.880 --> 21:16.362
with your gifts,
you can help it grow.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.061
Ready?

21:22.933 --> 21:24.283
Good.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.936
Again.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.380
Come on.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.122
You get a memory flash?

21:38.166 --> 21:40.734
I saw my dad and I
dropping seeds into the ground.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.042
DALLAS:
Oh, my God.

21:45.086 --> 21:47.436
MARIA:
It has fruit growing on it.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.661
Me and my dad,

21:54.704 --> 21:56.880
we planted this tree together.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.622
Wait.
What's wrong?[sighs]

21:59.666 --> 22:03.626
This picture was
in my mom's wedding album.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.412
This matches.

22:08.065 --> 22:11.025
I think our stories
are connected.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
How long have you been here?Eight years.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.734
I left my dad to run Deep Sky

22:24.778 --> 22:27.389
and decided to pursue
some of the family businesses.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.783
Wood carving,
distilling,

22:29.826 --> 22:32.307
and waiting for the
sky people to return.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.570
Well, they have returned.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.790
I'm Isobel.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.445
Forgive me, but the last one
I met tried to kill me

22:39.488 --> 22:41.795
and apparently shoved me
in the pod.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.318
Right.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.407
How did that happen?We Valentis

22:45.451 --> 22:49.890
have a myriad of alien items
found or given to us to hold.

22:49.933 --> 22:53.023
The empty pod was one of them.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.677
One day
this woman shows up

22:54.721 --> 22:56.026
covered in runes.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.419
We fought,

22:57.463 --> 22:58.812
and in the pod I went.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.335
You know, she's a shape-shifter.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.771
I'm thinking
that the stasis

23:01.815 --> 23:04.165
of the pod helped her hold
your form.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.473
Explains why she liked
that painting so much.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.041
Tezcatlipoca is a
shape-shifting Aztec god.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.740
She named herself Tezca before
sending me into a pod nap.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.525
[chuckles softly]
Guess she understands irony.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.744
Hmm.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.528
Thanks for patching me up.

23:19.572 --> 23:23.314
Yeah. It's the least
secret family members can do.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.752
Speaking of, um,
did you send your dad

23:25.795 --> 23:27.406
a letter to come
down here?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.016
My dad?

23:29.059 --> 23:30.191
No.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
We haven't talked in years.

23:32.454 --> 23:36.415
His "look at the sky" slant
is a bit granola for me.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.113
He forgets the aliens welcomed
our familia

23:39.156 --> 23:40.723
by lighting one on fire.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.333
No offense.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.467
Some come in peace,
others are better...

23:45.511 --> 23:47.338
cut into pieces.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.514
Oh.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.603
I look forward to your TED Talk.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.214
Uh, seeing as you are the
Valenti Careyes point person,

23:53.257 --> 23:55.695
do you have any idea
who might have sent that letter?

23:56.696 --> 23:59.568
Probably the crazy guÃ¼era
Allie Meyers.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.440
She's a scientist

24:01.483 --> 24:03.659
up and in on all things
alien down here.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.531
You wouldn't happen
to know where she is?

24:05.574 --> 24:08.185
Been in a pod,
and Allie goes

24:08.229 --> 24:10.753
where the science
and mescal take her.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.408
Hey, you're a sky person.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.584
Focus your energy
on the Calaveras.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.544
Now turn them counterclockwise
together.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.461
[whoosh, clack]

24:22.504 --> 24:24.550
[low whirring]

24:24.593 --> 24:26.421
SONYA:
It's empty.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.510
[speaks Spanish]

24:28.554 --> 24:31.165
Tezca took an artifact.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.862
What artifact?

24:32.906 --> 24:35.169
One brought down from Roswell
decades ago

24:35.212 --> 24:37.084
for us to keep safe.

24:37.127 --> 24:40.653
A stone board, etched
to hold alien glass pieces.

24:40.696 --> 24:41.871
What does it do?

24:41.915 --> 24:44.004
[sighs]:
Whatever it does...

24:44.047 --> 24:46.702
it was worth nearly killing me
to get it.

24:47.703 --> 24:52.273
â™ª If I were your lovebird

24:52.316 --> 24:56.320
â™ª Would you keep me in a cage?

24:56.364 --> 24:58.497
â™ª In the corner
of your living room... â™ª

24:58.540 --> 25:00.107
What are you doing here, Bonnie?

25:00.150 --> 25:04.285
â™ª Would you throw the cover
o'er me? â™ª

25:04.328 --> 25:06.287
Look at 'em.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.594
The three blend perfectly
into one.

25:08.637 --> 25:11.640
Clyde told me what you were
tasked to do with Eduardo.

25:11.684 --> 25:14.251
You knew him?

25:14.295 --> 25:16.950
He's really important
to my boyfriend.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.388
You need to tell me where he is.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.303
I can tell you
I didn't hurt him.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.348
I don't want to
do that anymore.
Oasis has always been

25:24.392 --> 25:26.655
Tezca and Clyde's dream,
but my dream is here.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.527
On Earth.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.919
And it's not just in the books

25:29.963 --> 25:31.486
and movies and songs,
it's everywhere.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.966
So I'm gonna run.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.837
Where?

25:34.881 --> 25:36.491
Doesn't matter.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.971
It does if they find you.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.190
The little that I know
about Tezca,

25:40.234 --> 25:42.018
she's not gonna be happy
that you bailed on her.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.501
And we both know
what happens next.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.763
What do you suggest I do,
Michael?

25:47.807 --> 25:49.852
Clyde cares about you.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.115
Maybe if you come back,
we could fight them.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.987
Together. You think
you could figure out

25:54.030 --> 25:55.597
what Tezca's endgame is?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.425
How they plan to get home?

25:57.468 --> 25:59.906
I-I don't know.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.343
Both Clyde and Tezca speak
in half-truths,

26:02.386 --> 26:04.780
even to each other.

26:04.824 --> 26:08.305
I think Tezca wanted to take
the clone back with us.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.656
I... I mean, I think that's
where her focus has been

26:10.699 --> 26:11.874
this whole time.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.615
[sighs]

26:15.704 --> 26:19.447
If we put an end to this...

26:19.490 --> 26:22.319
we'll both be free
to move forward.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.586
Tell me where Eduardo is.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.937
I promise I'll protect you.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.942
Hey.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.727
Uh, did, uh, did Max
come to talk to you?

26:38.771 --> 26:39.859
No.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.905
How about...

26:42.949 --> 26:45.386
I inject you, and we figure out
what he's been up to?

26:45.429 --> 26:47.214
The little things
get a pass,

26:47.257 --> 26:48.911
but this isn't a little thing.

26:48.955 --> 26:51.392
And I get that you want
to respect his space, but...

26:51.435 --> 26:53.699
sometimes you really do need
to kick the mule, Liz.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.310
Max needs you.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.922
[sighs]
It's Tezca, isn't it?
Yes.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.446
Casually dropping that
she lit Jones's body on fire,

27:02.490 --> 27:04.753
the unsettling feeling
he's spoken about

27:04.797 --> 27:07.103
for a year...He's been going to Old Sutter's
farm to clear his head.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.191
He's there.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.584
Okay.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.325
Oh, here.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.114
LIZ:
I'm sorry,
are you not worried about this?

27:18.158 --> 27:20.290
'Cause I'm definitely worried
about this.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.249
MICHAEL:
Maybe you should reconsider
waiting this one out.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.207
TEZCA:
Then you'll have no choice.

27:24.251 --> 27:27.123
MAX:
Where are you, Tezca?
Come to me.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.995
[whoosh]

27:35.305 --> 27:37.046
Figured if
you could use

27:37.090 --> 27:40.484
my powers against me, I
could use my powers against you.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.359
You can't lie in here,
Tezca, so...

27:45.402 --> 27:47.840
I think it's time
for me to ask the questions.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.154
How do I have these powers?

27:58.198 --> 27:59.721
There are things
that all of us can do--

27:59.765 --> 28:01.680
like telekinesis.

28:01.723 --> 28:02.942
Some talents are born

28:02.985 --> 28:04.726
specifically to individuals.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.033
So why are you so interested...

28:07.076 --> 28:08.904
in what I can do?

28:08.948 --> 28:11.472
Jones had a team editing
his genes,

28:11.515 --> 28:13.648
improving himself
with each version,

28:13.692 --> 28:15.171
collecting abilities.

28:15.215 --> 28:16.999
It's what made him
so formidable.

28:17.043 --> 28:17.957
You,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.610
as his clone,

28:19.654 --> 28:22.483
share his capacity to create
the blue flame.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.441
It's what makes you
a giver of life.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.617
Transformative
in many ways.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.576
Pure incitation.

28:28.619 --> 28:31.231
Enough riddles.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.407
Just tell me what it is.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.714
A bird doesn't know it can fly

28:35.757 --> 28:38.064
until it's forced out
of the nest

28:38.107 --> 28:40.370
and its wings burst wide.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.677
Then not only
does it know how,

28:42.721 --> 28:46.115
but it knows
it was always built to do so.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.770
So...

28:48.814 --> 28:52.426
if I can't deny this power...

28:52.469 --> 28:54.820
teach me to control it.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.391
Picture an energy
from within your center.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.396
Hold out your hands.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.269
Feel that energy

29:09.312 --> 29:11.706
travel from within to without.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.536
Now feel that spark ignite
on your fingertips.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.715
Bring your essence forward.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.804
Good. Now...

29:22.848 --> 29:25.938
move forward.

29:32.031 --> 29:35.991
Thank you
for the lesson in control.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.475
I think it's time
I put it into practice...

29:41.518 --> 29:43.607
and break our link.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.654
[grunts]

29:51.877 --> 29:53.443
[chuckles]

29:53.487 --> 29:55.141
[groans softly]

29:55.184 --> 29:57.360
I'd say class is dismissed.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.802
Points on being clever,

30:03.845 --> 30:06.979
but our link told me
where you were.

30:07.022 --> 30:10.112
Every step of the way today,
I've been right behind you.

30:10.156 --> 30:13.594
You know, Jones was right
about you being lost.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.074
Just wrong about your use.

30:15.117 --> 30:16.902
I have a cage.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.382
It held your leader.
It'll hold you.[chuckles]

30:19.426 --> 30:21.428
Cage can't hold me.

30:21.471 --> 30:22.951
Then I'll silence you.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.997
Go ahead and try.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.433
Anger is a great
motivator.

30:26.476 --> 30:27.869
I'll get thingsstarted.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.089
[grunting]

30:32.395 --> 30:35.746
You're wasting your potential
trying to save one small town

30:35.790 --> 30:37.574
when there's a whole planet
that needs saving.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.098
That is not my responsibility.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.621
It's your destiny.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.318
Ophiuchus has foreseen it.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.842
I don't care about Ophiuchus.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.411
[grunting]

30:48.455 --> 30:49.891
[both panting]

30:49.935 --> 30:52.938
Ophiuchus is more
than who leads it.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.332
It's a movement, a path.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.812
Now, you can disagree

30:57.856 --> 30:59.292
with Jones
how to fix it,

30:59.335 --> 31:01.120
but you will fix it.

31:01.163 --> 31:03.122
Earth is my home...

31:03.165 --> 31:04.297
not Oasis!

31:10.085 --> 31:12.174
[thud in distance]

31:13.175 --> 31:14.307
Oh.

31:15.656 --> 31:16.831
Hold up, Ortecho.

31:17.963 --> 31:18.920
[groans]

31:18.964 --> 31:19.921
Oh.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.532
Considering your eyes
are turning green,

31:22.576 --> 31:23.577
I think my serum worked.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.144
I'm glad, but...

31:25.187 --> 31:27.146
this, uh, this isn't exactly

31:27.189 --> 31:29.278
taking an aspirin.Okay, stay put.
I'll come back for you

31:29.322 --> 31:31.367
when I find Max.
Okay.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.121
How is that possible?

31:46.165 --> 31:48.384
I've been called
intrepid.

31:50.473 --> 31:53.520
Of course this is
your handiwork.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.174
Sounds like
you're not a fan.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.871
Jones was.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.526
He was quite impressed
with your intrepidness.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.136
Yeah, well...

32:01.180 --> 32:04.183
hole in his heart speaks
to just how much.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.706
Indeed.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.665
Makes me curious
what other unique outcomes

32:08.709 --> 32:09.971
your talents
might manifest.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.886
You leave her out of this.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.891
Why?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.241
Just as Ophiuchus has a plan
for you, Max,

32:19.285 --> 32:21.940
rest assured it has one for her.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.464
[roars]

32:29.512 --> 32:32.298
Butterflies don't turn back
into caterpillars, Max.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.778
Max...

32:34.822 --> 32:36.867
[gasps]

32:38.043 --> 32:39.914
No.
Oh, my God.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.872
Class dismissed.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.489
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna fix this.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.621
[high-pitched ringing]

32:51.665 --> 32:52.753
[gasps]

32:54.189 --> 32:55.495
[sobbing]

32:55.538 --> 32:57.801
[exhales][stops sobbing]

32:57.845 --> 33:00.021
I am so sorry.
I couldn't control...

33:00.065 --> 33:02.241
It was an
accident.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.288
I should have just told you
everything this morning...

33:06.332 --> 33:07.986
I should have pushed.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.815
I knew you were keeping
something from me
this morning.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.167
I should have been
a better partner.

33:16.168 --> 33:19.998
Let's just agree to...
share the blame for today.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.129
Yeah.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.088
Guess that's all
we can do.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.091
Come here.[exhales]

33:33.663 --> 33:35.361
You brought her back.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.189
I told you I would.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.974
Think she just needed
a minute...

33:40.018 --> 33:42.498
after her task.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.849
First time is hard.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.026
[chuckles]:
Well, whatever
you said to her...

33:48.069 --> 33:49.723
has brought her peace.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.117
I hope so.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.902
Given our talk
in the cave,

33:54.945 --> 33:57.513
I don't think that's been easy
for any of us to find.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.776
In a way...

34:02.475 --> 34:04.129
...still looking for mine.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.260
[chuckles softly]

34:07.567 --> 34:09.525
You want to see home.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.440
And not just a hologram.

34:25.019 --> 34:27.239
[exhales]

34:27.282 --> 34:29.632
Look at this.Yeah.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.287
Now, this is where we are.
Earth.Okay.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.419
[soft whoosh]

34:34.420 --> 34:36.726
This is...

34:37.727 --> 34:39.599
[whispers]:
Oasis.

34:39.642 --> 34:42.080
We're home.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.477
[camera clicking][mid-tempo Latin beat playing]

34:48.521 --> 34:50.566
â™ª

34:53.395 --> 34:54.918
[Kyle clears throat]

34:54.962 --> 34:56.659
[both chuckle]

34:58.096 --> 34:59.706
Okay, look.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.969
I think that you and I
deserve...

35:02.012 --> 35:03.492
a little fun.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.929
We saved a life.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.757
We got stacks
of connective tissue...

35:07.801 --> 35:09.150
Mm-hmm.the 1947 crash.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.109
Well, it feels like
there could be

35:11.152 --> 35:13.154
some real answers
down here for you and I.It does, doesn't it?

35:13.198 --> 35:15.461
Honestly, that is
just what I've needed.

35:15.504 --> 35:16.940
What's that?

35:16.984 --> 35:18.507
Just openness, you know?

35:18.551 --> 35:20.161
Discovery.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.510
Possibility.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.773
â™ª

35:24.774 --> 35:29.170
Anatsa-- she taught me
not to be afraid to love again,

35:29.214 --> 35:31.912
but she wasn't my person.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.786
And I think...

35:36.830 --> 35:39.093
deep down I did know that.

35:45.882 --> 35:48.537
To revelations
about love...

35:48.581 --> 35:50.626
and aliens.

35:50.670 --> 35:51.801
[laughs]

35:51.845 --> 35:53.499
Cheers.Cheers.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.764
Ooh.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.288
It's good.
Yeah.
[chuckles]

36:00.332 --> 36:03.073
[romantic ballad playing]

36:04.466 --> 36:07.426
You know, Valenti...

36:07.469 --> 36:10.037
you do still owe me a dance.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.213
Wha...

36:12.257 --> 36:14.433
Uh, there's some journals
and bandages...

36:14.476 --> 36:17.740
Will you stop it?
It's just a dance.

36:17.784 --> 36:19.525
[both muttering]

36:19.568 --> 36:22.571
â™ª In the shadows of my mind...

36:22.615 --> 36:25.487
You know, it's okay.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.968
You made it very clear
at Planet Seven

36:28.011 --> 36:29.796
how you feel about...

36:29.839 --> 36:31.711
interspecies relations.

36:31.754 --> 36:36.194
Well, it wasn't that I...
found you repulsive.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.804
Oh, you don't find me repulsive.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.762
Oh. Thank you.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.809
Quite the opposite.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.553
What's opposite?

36:47.596 --> 36:51.383
â™ª It's the way that you give
the love that I need... â™ª

36:51.426 --> 36:54.690
Beautiful, actually.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.997
â™ª Oh, it's you...

36:57.040 --> 36:59.304
Inside and out.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.306
â™ª It's just you

37:01.349 --> 37:06.615
â™ª Maybe it's you

37:08.095 --> 37:10.619
â™ª It's just you,
it's just you.â™ª

37:15.233 --> 37:17.452
You look like
you've had a day.

37:17.496 --> 37:20.368
Oh, you know,
the usual.

37:20.412 --> 37:23.719
Using science to untether a
shape-shifter from her victim.

37:23.763 --> 37:27.636
Sounds like I missed a couple
chapters of the Alien Book Club.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.159
Yeah, it's been a minute
since we talked.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.815
Which is why
I come bearing gifts.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.689
You do not need to thank
me for helping you.

37:36.732 --> 37:39.605
First glass is a thank-you.Mm-hmm.

37:39.648 --> 37:43.043
The rest is an apology.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.132
Everything you've
been going through with Mimi...

37:45.175 --> 37:47.526
No, it's...

37:47.569 --> 37:50.442
it's about the cure
that you gave me.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.574
Did it not work?No, it worked.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.968
It did exactly
what it was supposed to do.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.536
No more
brain degeneration.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.931
It also took away the cause.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.283
No more visions.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.198
Wait, that...

38:08.242 --> 38:11.332
You-you can't see Mimi anymore.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.727
[whispers]:
No.

38:15.728 --> 38:16.903
[sighs]

38:16.946 --> 38:18.905
I'm so sorry, Maria.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.907
I should have known

38:20.950 --> 38:22.604
that you needed
my help sooner, okay?

38:22.648 --> 38:23.779
I'm gonna fix this.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.259
There's nothing to fix.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.000
I might not be able
to see

38:27.043 --> 38:30.395
the future anymore, but you
gave me something even better.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.486
You gave me an actual future.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.791
Okay?

38:37.315 --> 38:40.883
So I don't want you to try
and go back on this, all right?

38:40.927 --> 38:43.930
What I need right now
is not a scientist.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.236
It's just a friend.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.151
Okay.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.378
[sighs]:
And, uh...

38:57.422 --> 38:59.902
I need my friend, too.

39:03.689 --> 39:07.954
I think Max and I want things
to be simpler than they can be.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.437
And I didn't see...

39:12.480 --> 39:14.961
I didn't see what was
right underneath my feet.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.618
Well, I think we should...

39:19.661 --> 39:22.360
take this bottle
and put it to good use

39:22.403 --> 39:25.145
and start swapping some stories.

39:25.188 --> 39:28.453
["Mad World" by Michael Andrews

39:28.496 --> 39:30.498
Well, Liz says she's okay,
but, you know,

39:30.542 --> 39:33.196
I can see her...
her wheels spinning.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.982
You got to be smarter
about your partnership.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.462
You got to fix that
before you try

39:37.505 --> 39:39.464
and get on one knee again.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.597
Copy you.

39:42.641 --> 39:46.862
Since you're leaving Roswell,
I think you should know...

look, I, uh...

39:48.473 --> 39:51.693
once really cared for you,
too, Cam.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.782
I just...You love Liz.

40:44.485 --> 40:48.010
me and my dad planted an
alien tree there in '47.

All right, I'm not quite
sure what he was up to yet,

40:50.578 --> 40:52.754
but I'm pretty sure
something bigger

40:52.798 --> 40:54.756
than just interplanetary
gardening.

That's where
the Dark Triad's been hiding.

Wait, what? Yeah.And that tree
that you planted,

40:58.543 --> 41:00.849
the fruit, it's not food.
