09:32.789 --> 09:34.574
Whatever we thought
we could manage with them,

09:34.617 --> 09:36.271
we can't.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.229
I mean, I-I don't think
you should keep playing

09:38.273 --> 09:40.405
undercover cop.I'm making headway
with Bonnie and Clyde.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.146
Really?
Do you have any idea

09:42.190 --> 09:43.931
what they stole from the
other security deposit boxes?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.629
I'm working on it.So there's no guarantee
that Tezca

09:46.673 --> 09:48.979
won't let me do something
I can't take back before then?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.415
Yeah, but I'm close.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.069
If you give me
the Octahedron,

09:52.113 --> 09:54.028
I know I can convince them
to tell me what it does.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.595
Bad idea.Yes.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.596
It's all a bad idea.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.597
But it's the idea

09:57.640 --> 09:58.946
that we got.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.350
You, though, you need to go
home and talk to your girl.

10:12.394 --> 10:15.658
I'll find Eduardo, figure out
what this glow cube does.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.008
Go team?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.838
Go team.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.580
I'm sorry.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.451
I'm sure this sucks.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.540
And, spoiler alert, I do
not have a lollipop for you

10:28.584 --> 10:30.368
when I am done.[laughs softly]

10:30.412 --> 10:32.675
Oh, I, uh,
don't need a lollipop

10:32.719 --> 10:34.895
when I already feel
like a sucker.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.418
Why do you think

10:36.461 --> 10:37.680
Max is lying to us?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.377
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.901
I don't get it.
You see this path

10:40.944 --> 10:44.078
through all this
complicated alien DNA stuff,

10:44.121 --> 10:45.166
but you're unwilling

10:45.209 --> 10:46.689
to call your boyfriend out

10:46.733 --> 10:48.212
when he's being
a closed-off dumbass?

10:48.256 --> 10:51.694
Max is only going to tell me
when he's ready.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.175
We trust each other.
I'm not gonna ruin that.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.699
I'm not telling you
to read his diary.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.266
And I think that Max

10:58.309 --> 11:01.138
is a mule,
and sometimes you just gotta...

11:01.182 --> 11:03.140
give him a kick to make him go.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.534
Max and I don't kick each other.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.189
He's got to come
to his own decisions.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.975
And if you want that
parasitic alien gone,

11:12.019 --> 11:15.196
then I got to go run this
through the lab at Senovative.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.502
All right.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.549
[door opens]

11:21.768 --> 11:23.421
[door closes]

11:24.422 --> 11:25.859
She should be out for a while.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.035
So that's our, uh, what...

11:28.078 --> 11:30.211
second successful
surgery? Sound right?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.779
[chuckles]
And I'd say
that's two too many.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.302
But...

11:34.345 --> 11:35.912
thank you for your help.

11:35.956 --> 11:39.611
You're just lucky
I had a craving for... menudo.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.483
Quips aside,

11:41.526 --> 11:42.614
tell me,

11:42.658 --> 11:44.051
why are you here?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.402
Yeah. I, uh...

11:47.445 --> 11:50.622
I finally mustered up
the courage to talk to Anatsa,

11:50.666 --> 11:52.624
and...

11:52.668 --> 11:55.627
she didn't really want
to listen.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.021
And honestly, I can't
blame her, 'cause it's

11:58.065 --> 12:00.545
not the first time
that I have...

12:00.589 --> 12:03.897
lied about who I am to someone
that I've claimed to love.

12:03.940 --> 12:07.117
Only, of course, this time I
actually had someone who was...

12:07.161 --> 12:09.076
worthy of my honestly.
[sighs]

12:09.119 --> 12:12.253
But instead of telling
her the truth, I just...

12:12.296 --> 12:15.343
drove the only good relationship
I've ever had right off a cliff.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.128
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Isobel.

12:18.172 --> 12:21.218
Yeah, it's...

12:21.262 --> 12:23.046
Anyway...
[sniffles]

12:23.090 --> 12:24.526
it's good.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.789
Honestly, I just,
I needed to leave Roswell,

12:26.833 --> 12:30.358
uh, just get
a little perspective.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.318
It's a relief being around you.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
[sighs]:
Uh...

12:40.194 --> 12:43.632
I-I wish I could, uh,
get some more perspective

12:43.675 --> 12:45.765
on our pod patient.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.640
I might have an idea.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.907
I think this casita's owned
by your family.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.176
[exhales]

13:12.182 --> 13:14.402
You looking for someone?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.498
I was looking for you.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.282
And then I, uh...

13:25.326 --> 13:26.675
saw the rope.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.590
What happened?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.505
We were holding
a loose end.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.767
Did they get away?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.464
Bonnie was tasked
with making sure

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
he didn't get away
from anything.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.207
Well, why not just...

13:37.251 --> 13:38.774
mind-wipe him?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.863
I wasn't the one
who decided his fate.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.386
But regardless,

13:42.430 --> 13:44.780
Bonnie should have been back
hours ago.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.260
What do you think happened
to them?

13:46.303 --> 13:48.436
As part of her Triad,
I can feel her.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.654
She's...

13:49.698 --> 13:51.482
she's conflicted,

13:51.526 --> 13:53.658
angry, scared.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.835
But I can't tell
if there's a physical cause.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.880
Bonnie is powerful
but unpredictable,

13:57.924 --> 13:59.490
and without guidance,

13:59.534 --> 14:01.318
unpredictable things tend
to happen.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.452
Well, shall we stop wasting
fresh air and go find her?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.718
I don't care whose son you are.

14:09.761 --> 14:13.026
If your little chats with
Bonnie hurt her in any way,

14:13.069 --> 14:14.810
I will destroy you.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.073
[whispers]:
All I want to do is help.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.208
Then come with me.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.908
See, on the night
you crashed,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.562
it says that
otherworldly objects

14:27.605 --> 14:29.216
started falling
from the sky.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.608
So, when they saw
what was happening,

14:30.652 --> 14:31.914
they collected
everything they could

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
and they brought it here,

14:34.047 --> 14:37.006
to a casita they named
after the Aztec word for "star."

14:37.050 --> 14:38.616
Xitlali.Mm-hmm.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.531
And then they
charged themselves

14:40.575 --> 14:42.272
with protecting
the artifacts

14:42.316 --> 14:44.535
until the Sky Gods
came back for it.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.276
Hmm.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.104
Look at this.Hmm?

14:48.148 --> 14:50.977
Alma. That's,
uh, Hector's wife.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.110
This must have been written
after the night of the crash.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.025
Apparently, after what
happened there that night,

14:56.069 --> 14:58.027
the Valentis in Roswell
decided to cut communication

14:58.071 --> 14:59.942
with their family
in Careyes.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.944
They wanted to make
sure to protect

15:01.988 --> 15:03.903
anything
extraterrestrial

15:03.946 --> 15:06.949
from falling
into the wrong hands.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.213
Kyle. Your family

15:10.257 --> 15:13.782
has been protecting my family
for the last 75 years.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.827
You know what this
means, right?

15:16.828 --> 15:18.352
[chuckles]

15:18.395 --> 15:20.093
[awkward chuckle]

15:20.136 --> 15:25.011
Uh, this is a, uh,
log of every Valenti

15:25.054 --> 15:27.143
who's lived
at Xitlali ever since.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.536
Huh.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.407
It says Sonya Valenti

15:30.451 --> 15:32.192
from Santa Fe.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.802
Santa Fe.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.456
Isn't Eduardo from Santa Fe?

15:36.892 --> 15:38.676
Has he ever mentioned
a daughter?
No.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.636
But it's not like my family
doesn't have a history of...

15:41.679 --> 15:43.681
secret daughters, so...

15:43.725 --> 15:45.205
Wh...

15:45.248 --> 15:47.076
[speaks Spanish]

15:47.120 --> 15:49.165
[speaking Spanish]

15:54.649 --> 15:57.217
Hey, can you
light these?

16:05.790 --> 16:06.878
[grunts]

16:06.922 --> 16:08.445
[exhales sharply]

16:08.489 --> 16:10.882
This is where Bonnie
comes to be alone.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.624
Her own little "wonders
of Earth" hideaway.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.148
Have you told Tezca
about this place?

16:15.191 --> 16:17.019
I know I'm hard on Bonnie
sometimes,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.803
but I'm just trying
to protect her

16:18.847 --> 16:21.197
from the worst alternative.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.547
What's the worst alternative?Doesn't matter.

16:23.591 --> 16:26.289
Once we're back on Oasis,
all this will be resolved.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.466
What's that, uh,
human saying?

16:29.510 --> 16:31.599
"The grass is greener
on the other side"?

16:31.642 --> 16:32.992
Mm.This world is

16:33.035 --> 16:35.646
bright and shiny and new.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.388
It's easy for Bonnie
to forget the...

16:38.432 --> 16:41.130
the value of home.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.697
There is plenty
of suffering here, too,

16:42.740 --> 16:45.526
but the pleasures of this world
hide it

16:45.569 --> 16:47.658
behind glamour.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.096
Humans are obsessed
with the illusion

16:50.139 --> 16:53.229
of happiness.I am intimately familiar.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.407
Growing up,
plenty of people passed on me.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.844
Take a look at a troubled kid,

16:59.888 --> 17:02.891
and they decided that
my value wasn't enough.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.678
On the Oasis,
I didn't have a home.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.898
I had to run

17:09.941 --> 17:12.335
and steal and hide.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.076
And then

17:14.120 --> 17:15.121
the, uh...

17:15.164 --> 17:16.818
Savior found me.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.255
Jones gave your life value.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.519
He gave me a
path forward.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.347
Bonnie gave me value.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.480
She never gave up

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
on her dream that
our world could change.

17:28.525 --> 17:32.051
And so, soon I just wanted
to make that dream a reality.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.096
And Oasis is

17:34.140 --> 17:36.446
not perfect.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.405
But it could be.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.453
Hey, Bonnie is enamored
with human food.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.934
MICHAEL:
And she's a big fan of music.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.634
Hmm.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.593
You check the grub trucks.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.856
I'll check
the second-hand instruments.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.031
Yeah.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.256
Hey.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.127
Hey.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.260
Ah, see your eyes
are still blue.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.741
I guess Liz hasn't been able to
get rid of Tezca's DNA yet, huh?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.439
Nope.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.659
But Little Miss Science
went off to the lab

18:15.703 --> 18:18.401
to mix up
my alien-freeing cocktail, so...

18:18.445 --> 18:20.273
And...

18:20.316 --> 18:23.276
now I can ask you why the hell
you showed up this morning

18:23.319 --> 18:25.843
to deliver us all
a bunch of lies?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.671
What?
And I swear
you best not give me

18:27.715 --> 18:29.064
another one.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
I left a few things out.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.766
But Tezca is the
real problem here.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.813
I would actually love
some of your Quantico insight

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
on how to take her down.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.773
Seeing as I technically
put myself

18:42.817 --> 18:46.212
on this whole "E.T. robs a bank"
thing on the sly,

18:46.255 --> 18:50.172
my boss wants my insight back
in the home office tomorrow.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.956
But...

18:52.000 --> 18:55.917
I mean, if we're talking
erasing powers,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.920
how about talking to the world's
only alien scientist...

18:58.963 --> 19:01.227
I don't want to burden Liz.Evans,

19:01.270 --> 19:03.533
we're not talking about
picking up your dry cleaning.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.970
In the history
of our relationship,

19:06.014 --> 19:08.799
Liz has always been trying
to save me.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.150
I need to be able
to save her back.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.502
Then be honest with her, Evans.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.156
What is going on, Cam?

19:17.199 --> 19:19.027
You're supposed to be
on my side.
Yeah.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.724
[groans]

19:21.856 --> 19:23.858
I am on your side.

19:23.901 --> 19:27.949
So much so that at one point...

19:27.992 --> 19:30.256
I was in love with you.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.954
And I was never honest
about that.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.435
I know we're not partners
anymore,

19:35.478 --> 19:37.132
but...

19:37.176 --> 19:40.091
I still need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.618
Don't mess this up with Liz.

19:44.661 --> 19:49.144
And don't let someone else
decide your fate for you.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.894
It feels a little less abandoned
than I thought it would.

19:59.937 --> 20:03.811
Yeah, well, in the interest
of not running into any trouble,

20:03.854 --> 20:07.902
does any of this
look familiar, or...?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.213
I think I've been here before.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.523
[child laughing]

20:32.709 --> 20:35.016
Hey, Dad.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.932
You dropped
the necklace you always wear.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.629
Oh. Thank you, son.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.544
Would have been
terrible to lose this.

20:41.588 --> 20:42.589
Why?

20:42.632 --> 20:43.938
Because this is home.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.679
I thought home was far away.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.336
The idea of home can live
in many places.

20:50.379 --> 20:51.641
Here.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.644
Here.

20:55.645 --> 20:59.040
And sometimes the very ground
beneath your feet.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.783
And I think that you've chosen
an excellent place for this.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.960
You ready?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.836
Now...

21:12.880 --> 21:16.362
with your gifts,
you can help it grow.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.061

21:57.925 --> 21:59.622
Wait.
What's wrong?[sighs]

21:59.666 --> 22:03.626
This picture was
in my mom's wedding album.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.412
This matches.

22:08.065 --> 22:11.025
I think our stories
are connected.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
How long have you been here?Eight years.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.734
I left my dad to run Deep Sky

22:24.778 --> 22:27.389
and decided to pursue
some of the family businesses.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.783
Wood carving,
distilling,

22:29.826 --> 22:32.307

sky people to return.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.570
Well, they have returned.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.790
I'm Isobel.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.445
Forgive me, but the last one
I met tried to kill me

22:39.488 --> 22:41.795
and apparently shoved me
in the pod.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.318
Right.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.407
How did that happen?We Valentis

22:45.451 --> 22:49.890

found or given to us to hold.

22:49.933 --> 22:53.023
The empty pod was one of them.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.677
One day
this woman shows up

22:54.721 --> 22:56.026
covered in runes.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.419
We fought,

22:57.463 --> 22:58.812
and in the pod I went.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.335
You know, she's a shape-shifter.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.771
I'm thinking
that the stasis

23:01.815 --> 23:04.165
of the pod helped her hold
your form.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.473
Explains why she liked
that painting so much.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.041
Tezcatlipoca is a
shape-shifting Aztec god.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.740
She named herself Tezca before
sending me into a pod nap.

23:13.783 --> 23:16.525
[chuckles softly]
Guess she understands irony.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.744
Hmm.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.528
Thanks for patching me up.

23:19.572 --> 23:23.314
Yeah. It's the least
secret family members can do.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.752
Speaking of, um,
did you send your dad

23:25.795 --> 23:27.406
a letter to come
down here?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.016
My dad?

23:29.059 --> 23:30.191
No.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411
We haven't talked in years.

23:32.454 --> 23:36.415
His "look at the sky" slant
is a bit granola for me.

who might have sent that letter?

28:40.414 --> 28:42.677

does it know how,

28:42.721 --> 28:46.115
but it knows
it was always built to do so.

So...

28:48.814 --> 28:52.426
if I can't deny this power...
