00:04.172 --> 00:06.413
Mr. Sedlak!

00:08.384 --> 00:09.749
Mr. Sedlak?

00:12.263 --> 00:14.720
You’re eight days late
with the rent.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.763
Just because
I’m the new super,

00:16.851 --> 00:20.389
doesn’t mean I won’t
heave your sorry ass
out the window...

00:20.479 --> 00:21.980
ifl have a mind to.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.148
What a slob!

00:26.235 --> 00:28.692
[Squeaking]

00:31.282 --> 00:34.740
Someone’s not getting
their security deposit back.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.624
How did you complete
your undergraduate degree
in two years...

00:43.711 --> 00:45.747
while confined to
a juvenile detention
facility?

00:45.838 --> 00:47.794
[ Southern Accent]
Some people are born
with a knack for shootin’.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.588
Some singin’. Me?
[Clicks Tongue]

00:49.675 --> 00:51.381
I got a knack for thinkin’.
Simple as that.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.927
[ Chuckles ] You graduated
top of your university class
when you were 16.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.970
You’ll have a doctorate
by the time you’re 20.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.889
There is nothing simple
about that.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.887
And you’re sure
I’m clear to work here?

01:00.978 --> 01:03.469
After such a kindness,
I don’t wanna get no one
in trouble on my account.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.976
I spoke to your parole officer
in North Carolina.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.934
Your record
is officially expunged
and sealed forever.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.312
So it’s no problem.
I cannot thank you enough,
Dr. Saroyan.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.239
Ah, the pleasure’s mine.
I’m the one that’s getting
a brilliant new intern.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.442
Well, I’m just
a simple country boy...

01:17.536 --> 01:19.663
tryin’ to put
one foot in front
of the other, ma’am.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.910
Well, put on this simple lab coat
and you can help me
prep the forensic platform.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.331
All right.

01:26.212 --> 01:28.248
[ Device Beeps ]

01:28.339 --> 01:30.580
[Laughs]

01:30.675 --> 01:33.508
- [ Device Beeps ]
- [Woman ]
Running it right now.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.926
[Squeaking]

01:36.013 --> 01:39.096
There are
multiple lacerations
to the ribs.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.765
Yeah. That’ll happen
when you’re thrown
through a terrarium.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.685
I gotcha.
Skin as smooth
as a baby’s bottom.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.309
Looks like Dr. Evil’s hat.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.356
Yeah. I’ll analyze their scat
back at the lab.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.276
That sounds exciting.
Okay, so, what do
we got here, Bones?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.775
The victim is a female.
Early 30s.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.983
It appears death was caused
by the L1 vertebra being punctured,

01:59.078 --> 02:02.366
severing the posterior
spinal vein and arteries.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.868
Dr. Brennan, you sure
you don’t want a chair?
The way you’re squatting,

02:04.959 --> 02:07.245
I’m worried
that little guy in there
is gonna just drop right out.

02:07.336 --> 02:10.328
Thank you, but my uterus
and cervical plug
are quite healthy.

02:10.423 --> 02:12.709
Also, I’m not having a boy.
It’s a girl.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.337
[ Chuckles ]
Having a girl—
Excuse me?

02:15.428 --> 02:19.637
Well, the— the fetus
growing inside my womb
has female genitalia.

02:19.724 --> 02:22.511
You guys are having a girl?
That is so awesome.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.637
Okay, you know what?
Just wait one second.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.469
Can I just have a little word
with you here?

02:26.564 --> 02:28.225
You’re guessing, right,
what we’re having?

02:28.316 --> 02:31.228
No. I had an ultrasound
at the doctor’s
this morning.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.225
Are you displeased
with the results?
No!

02:33.321 --> 02:37.234
I’m thrilled. But you can’t
just spring something like that
on me in public.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.987
Why didn’t you tell me that
you had a doctor’s appointment?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.989
Ultrasounds
are poorly pixilated
and in black and white.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.991
You only like movies
that are in color.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.573
I would’ve loved this movie.
It would’ve been
my favorite movie of all time.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.377
I’m sorry. I had no idea
that our child’s genitals
were so important to you.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.705
Bones, I am the father,
you see.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.176
All right, you know,
I can’t deal with this
right now.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.670
We’ll talk about it
later.

02:57.762 --> 03:00.845
Okay, so, victim here
is a female. Correct?

03:00.931 --> 03:03.843
Yes. Should I
have told you that
in private as well?

03:03.934 --> 03:06.346
[ Chuckles] That’s good.
Let’s just keep
pressing forward.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.224
Okay, so the registered tenant
was a Mr. Sedlak.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.601
He can’t be located,
so this is definitely
not the tenant.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.479
And why did the rats
only eat half of her?

03:14.612 --> 03:18.525
Well, since they’re hairless,
the rats need to stay warm under
the terrarium’s U.V. lights.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.824
The rats were just food
for the real tenant—

03:21.911 --> 03:23.697
Python reg/us.

03:23.788 --> 03:28.077
It appears that our slithering
friend has found another
warm and cozy hiding spot.

03:28.167 --> 03:31.751
Well, it’s very possible
that the python consumed
some evidence...

03:31.837 --> 03:33.247
which we will need
to retrieve.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.000
Right. Hodgins,
you find the snake.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.707
- Bones, you take the body
back to the Jeffersonian.
- What are you gonna do?

03:37.802 --> 03:42.421
Well, it’s not really important
that we share every detail
of our day, now, is it?

03:42.515 --> 03:45.678
I agree.
For a moment, I thought
you didn’t understand.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.304
[ Scoffs ]

03:56.612 --> 03:59.775
[ Device Beeping ]

03:59.865 --> 04:02.277
Mr. Abernathy,
a few observations...

04:02.368 --> 04:05.610
so that I may judge your ability
with a real set of remains.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.910
Yes, ma’am.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.658
Uh, the victim
is a female.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.206
Normally I would say
late 20s to early 30s.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.705
But in this case,
I would say 30 to 31...

04:13.796 --> 04:17.380
based on the sternal
rib ends— smooth,
only a few pores—

04:17.466 --> 04:20.629
sharp rim edge
irregularly contoured,
zero projections.

04:20.719 --> 04:24.382
That in conjuncture with
a barely discernible fusion line
at the medial clavicle...

04:24.473 --> 04:25.883
gives us precise age.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.138
As for injuries,
cursory examination shows
sharp force trauma...

04:29.228 --> 04:31.685
present on the ribs,
posterior ulna,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.104
humerus
and supraspinous fossa.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.479
It’s all consistent with
being thrown through annealed
rather than tempered glass.

04:37.570 --> 04:40.983
Uh, said glass approximately
six millimeters in thickness,

04:41.073 --> 04:43.485
judging by the shards
protruding from the scapula.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.862
A promising start.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.693
Dr. Saroyan?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.575
Uh, sure. ’Cause who wouldn’t
wanna follow that act?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.160
Well, uh, feeding activity...

04:53.252 --> 04:55.243
on the lower half of the body
was isolated,

04:55.337 --> 04:58.545
leaving this entire portion
almost fully intact,

04:58.632 --> 05:01.624
including much of
the small intestine and—

05:01.719 --> 05:03.675
Whoa! Did you guys see that?

05:03.762 --> 05:07.129
Uh, peristalsis
due to abdominal distention?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.849
Except the victim
has no abdomen.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.562
Oh, God!
Get it out of here!

05:19.695 --> 05:22.061
[Saroyan ]
Oh, God. I hate snakes.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.898
- Dr. Hodgins?
- [ Saroyan ]
Somebody kill that thing.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.449
You can come back to the lab.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.073
We discovered the warm place
where the python was hiding.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.155
Oh, I gotta say, ma’am,

05:32.249 --> 05:34.740
this is the best
damn job ever.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.579
[ Device Beeps ]
So, I hear Finn saved you
from having a heart attack.

06:13.666 --> 06:16.123
Yes, he’s quite handy
with serpents.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.700
Even Dr. Brennan
was impressed.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.126
Really? It’s rare for her...

06:19.213 --> 06:21.078
to trust a new intern
to work solo.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.255
Well, I’ll, uh—
l’ll try to do her proud.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.879
Seriously? “Do her proud”?

06:25.970 --> 06:27.130
Yes, sir.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.052
Okay.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.595
What exactly did you do...

06:30.683 --> 06:32.423
to wind up in juvie
for three years anyway?

06:32.518 --> 06:33.849
Dr. Hodgins,
we have work to do.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.551
Yeah.
It’s an innocent question.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.227
No need to worry, Dr. Hodgins.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.225
A few mistakes when l was a sprout.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.058
But now I’m as honest as the sunshine
on the back of a honey bee.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.767
Why is that honest?

06:43.862 --> 06:47.446
There’s a lot of masticated
food in the teeth. A lot.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.401
Oh, wow. It looks like she
was eating from a trough
just before she died.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.828
Okay. I’ll floss and see if I
find anything interesting.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.622
The victim’s mandibular fossa
is unusually shallow,

06:57.710 --> 06:59.826
allowing for
the condylar process
to slip.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.787
I mean, this lady’sjaw
could unhinge itself,
like a python.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.257
She could swallow
anything.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.127
Excuse me.

07:07.595 --> 07:11.838
Well, I’m confused, Finn.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.516
No one spends
three years in juvie
for hot-wiring a tractor.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.059
Dr. Hodgins.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.309
I reckon he has a right to know.
I did some joyridin’.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.980
Uh, mailbox baseball.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.649
I borrowed a few things
from the grocery
I shouldn’t have.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.352
Look, I ain’t
proud of it, sir.

07:26.447 --> 07:30.656
But now I’m proud
to be able to assist y’all
in whatever way I can.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.483
Okay then.

07:32.578 --> 07:36.821
Well, I reckon
l’d best go look and see
what we found in the teeth.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.531
- [Clicks Tongue]
- [Chuckles]

07:40.628 --> 07:43.961
- I’m so sorry, Finn.
- No problem, ma’am.

07:44.048 --> 07:48.417
But there is something here
that is as odd
as my cousin Bobby.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.968
We have an extra bone,
and it’s the victim’s,

07:52.056 --> 07:55.298
- ’cause it’s covered
in her scar tissue.
- An extra bone?

07:55.392 --> 07:57.883
It must be due to Fibrodysplasia
ossificanus progressiva.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.266
You know, the disorder
that causes muscle
and tissue to ossify.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.064
But I’d sure feel better
if Dr. Brennan took a look-see.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.318
[ Booth ]
So, the original leaseholder,
Gerald Sedlak,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.782
has been living in Cleveland
for four years.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.820
I don’t understand.
Well, the apartment,
it’s rent controlled.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.323
So when he moved out,
he just sold his key
to the next tenant.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.119
Who posed as Sedlak
for the cheap rent.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.993
That’s a good move
in this economy.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.740
Who was it?
We’re not sure.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.666
But there
have been seven tenants
all registered under Sedlak,

08:23.754 --> 08:25.961
the last one being a female,
but she kept to herself.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.835
And you want to see
if I can give a profile
based on her personal effects?

08:28.926 --> 08:32.510
That’s right. I want you
to use your Jedi mind powers.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.212
- I like it when you
call me a Jedi.
- Well, most kids do.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.174
Oh, hey, congratulations,
by the way.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.099
- I hear you’re having a girl.
- How did you know?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.643
I ran into Dr. Brennan
this morning.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.311
She was leaving the doctor.
Why? Is it a secret?

08:43.399 --> 08:44.684
Obviously not.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.767
She’s probably hired
a skywriter to tell the world.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.317
Is there something I should know?

08:49.405 --> 08:51.942
Hmm. Yeah.
Who the victim is.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.569
Well, I mean,

08:54.660 --> 08:56.571
she has virtually
no personal effects,

08:56.662 --> 08:58.402
no— no photos on the wall.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.533
- Was there any mail?
- No, no mail.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.955
There’s not much to go on here.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.452
There’s a couch, a kitchen table.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.750
And the python.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.749
No home would be complete
without a python.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.296
True. Very true.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.294
It says here that the neighbors
who did see the victim...

09:11.385 --> 09:13.592
described her
as extremely attractive.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.136
She was seen multiple times
with very fat men.

09:16.223 --> 09:20.762
Prostitutes sometimes keep
a separate place to conduct
their, you know, business.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.185
And snakes are often
seen as sexual.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.763
Maybe one of the clients
got a little too excited?

09:25.858 --> 09:28.270
[Device Beeps]

09:31.113 --> 09:32.319
Oh, good Lord.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.317
And you wonder why nobody
ever visits you.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.319
Which makes it doubly odd
that you’re here.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.493
I’m here ’cause someone
needs to knock some sense
into you, Cher/e.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.788
What were you thinking,
bringing a criminal
into this lab?

09:42.875 --> 09:45.412
Caroline, I’ve already
had this conversation
once today.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.958
Finn has
no criminal record.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.788
He did, until two days ago
when he turned 18
and it was expunged.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.999
You should have talked to me
before you hired him.

09:53.093 --> 09:57.006
Why should I discuss
with a federal prosecutor
who I hire in my lab?

09:57.097 --> 10:01.466
Tell me, what happens when
a defense attorney questions
the integrity of this lab...

10:01.560 --> 10:04.427
because we have
a teenage miscreant
handling evidence?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.603
So you think
that this young man,

10:06.690 --> 10:08.772
brilliant by even
Dr. Brennan’s standards,

10:08.859 --> 10:11.942
should be condemned forever
because of some youthful
indiscretions?

10:12.029 --> 10:13.644
Sometimes life isn’t fair.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.695
But I don’t have
to help it along.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.820
He deserves a chance,
and I’m gonna
give it to him.

10:18.911 --> 10:21.618
Now, unless you
would like to help,

10:21.705 --> 10:23.821
l have some work to do.

Wow! Oh!
Look at number two go!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.938
He’s amazing!
Oh, he’s using
the Valsalva maneuver.

21:20.029 --> 21:23.396
It increases thoracic pressure
throughout the esophagus,

21:23.491 --> 21:25.231
allowing him
to ingest more food.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.032
You really did
your homework, huh?

21:27.162 --> 21:29.494
Well, it’s an anatomically
fascinating case.

Oh, God.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.411
He took in extra air
because of the speed
with which he ate.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.542
That, coupled with
the digestive process,

23:45.633 --> 23:48.841
made it necessary for his body
to expel the gas he produced.

- [ Burping]
- Wow.

that I killed her.

that you’re notjealous.

She had that freakyjaw.

- God. You’re messing up
my flow here.

that Tina was killed
on Tuesday evening.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.360
Oh, no,

24:53.451 --> 24:56.443
See, since the snake’s
digestive juices are regulated
by body temperature,

24:56.537 --> 25:00.325
I’m cooling our slimy friend
to 26.1 degrees Celsius
to slow down his metabolism.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.668
- That’ll kill him.
- Not in five minutes it won’t.

25:02.752 --> 25:05.585
- We’ll have time
to warm him up after.
- After what?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.539
- After we get out the distal phalanx.
- Without cutting him open?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.043
Yes, sir.

25:10.134 --> 25:13.467
See, here’s a little somethin’
I learned at my fishin’ hole.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.840
Many snakes,
when confronted by
the specter of death,

25:15.932 --> 25:18.389
are known to upchuck what’s
in their stomach contents.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.683
That way,
they may slither away
unencumbered.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.761
And I’ve spooked
a few serpents in my day.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.811
And why didn’t you
bring this up before?

25:24.899 --> 25:27.936

treating me like a piece of scat
and not wantin’ me to speak.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.018
Yeah, well,
I said I’m sorry, so—

25:30.113 --> 25:33.526
Actually, sir, I believe “I’m sorry”
must’ve slipped your mind.

very difficult.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.946
He doesn’t seem like
the kind of person...

32:31.033 --> 32:33.115
who would quit
before we solve the case.

32:33.202 --> 32:36.160
He did have
a questionable past,
Dr. Brennan.

32:38.874 --> 32:41.126
Look at
the victim’s teeth.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.828
Tooth erosion. Due to
increased stomach acid
from overeating?

32:44.922 --> 32:46.708
That’s what I thought as well.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.632
However, based on Booth’s
most recent interview,

32:49.718 --> 32:52.460
vomiting seems
a more accurate cause.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.383
But she was a champion.
I thought they never vomited.
Correct.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.590
So there has to be
another explanation.

32:59.061 --> 33:02.178
Wouldn’t it be
illogical for Finn,
if he were still a danger,

33:02.273 --> 33:05.982
to work where his every move
is observed and documented...

33:06.068 --> 33:08.184
by the most brilliant minds
of the Jeffersonian?

33:08.279 --> 33:10.144
Yes.

33:10.239 --> 33:13.447
But he’s a kid.
He might not be
that reasonable.

33:13.534 --> 33:17.118
I’ve seen his work.
I can assure you that he is.

33:21.250 --> 33:24.583
There is diastasis
of the symphysis pubis.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.127
A very subtle widening.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.330
A widening?
Meaning—

33:29.425 --> 33:33.293
Tina wasn’t vomiting
because of the quantity of food
she was consuming.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.387
She was eight weeks pregnant.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.389
You said before
how grateful you were
to be able to quit your day job.

33:46.483 --> 33:50.726
H was a garbage man.
Wouldn’t you want to quit
if you had the chance?

33:50.821 --> 33:53.654
I don’t know. Because right now
I’m dealing with garbage
that stands about 5 foot 10.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.652
And, uh,
I’m not quittin’ myjob.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.984
[ Scoffs ]
You got no right.
You don’t know me.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.989
Really? ’Cause I interviewed
your neighbors.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.038
And they said the both of you
argued all the way
up till the day she died.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.410
So?

34:04.501 --> 34:06.162
So, what’d you argue about?

34:07.046 --> 34:09.253
We-We argued about
having kids.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.046
She wanted me
to change my mind.

34:11.175 --> 34:14.463
You didn’t want
to have children?
God, no. Not now.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.465
Tina was just starting
to make some good money.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.263
It’s crazy
to throw all that away
for a kid.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.012
We had years for that.
Right?

34:22.102 --> 34:24.013
Right.
So you wouldn’t be happy...

34:24.104 --> 34:27.847
if your wife
quit competitive eating
to start a family.

34:30.194 --> 34:32.856
I don’t have to talk to you.

34:32.947 --> 34:35.029
I don’t have to say
another word.

34:40.204 --> 34:43.571
Her husband admitted
that her career
was more important to him...

34:43.666 --> 34:45.076
than having a baby.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.749
Surprisingly,
I’m a bit horrified
as well.

34:47.836 --> 34:51.670
Although my career will help
provide a fascinating life
for our daughter.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.294
But I think you have to
let Tina’s husband go.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.922
What? Why?
He’s got motive.
He’s got opportunity.

34:57.012 --> 35:00.300
- But he only weighs 183 pounds.
- So what?

35:00.391 --> 35:02.973
Based on a suggestion
from Mr. Abernathy,

35:03.060 --> 35:06.973
Angela calculated
both the mass
and the acceleration...

35:07.064 --> 35:09.851
the killer would need
in order to throw our victim
through the glass terrarium.

35:09.942 --> 35:13.981
- Right.
- The assailant would need
to weigh at least 312 pounds.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.938
Okay. So we’re looking
for someone who is
at least 300 pounds.

35:17.032 --> 35:21.867
Yes. Both Mitch Clancy
and Brian Tobin
would be ideal suspects.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.070
Bones, I can’t arrest someone
because they’re fat.

35:24.206 --> 35:28.245
Well, I’m still compiling evidence,
although my intern
seems to have disappeared.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.621
What, the kid?
What, is he in trouble?

35:30.713 --> 35:33.500
I imagine he will be
if he loses his career.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.047
I’ll re-examine the injuries
that Tina sustained...

35:36.135 --> 35:37.841
when she was thrown
through the glass.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.214
Perhaps I’ll find
something you can use.

But I realized quittin’
was a coward’s way out.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.699
It is.

36:52.795 --> 36:55.628
Please clean
the distal phalanx
you recovered.

37:00.803 --> 37:03.169
I shouldn’t have left it
like that, should I?

37:04.264 --> 37:06.801
I trust that was
a rhetorical question.

37:07.643 --> 37:09.008
Yes, ma’am.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.886
Did your interest
in forensics...

37:12.981 --> 37:15.472
stem from a plan
to murder your stepfather?

37:19.696 --> 37:21.527
Yes, ma’am, it did.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.695
Dr. Saroyan mentioned that
he was physically abusive...

37:25.786 --> 37:27.697
to both you and your mother.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.574
He had a temper.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.701
Probably why
I behaved like I did.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.329
Could never find a way
to make the mad go away.

37:35.629 --> 37:39.918
So, did you murder your stepfather,
Mr. Abernathy?

37:40.008 --> 37:42.385
No, ma’am, I did not.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.344
What stopped you?

37:48.934 --> 37:51.471
“Postmortem Dismemberment,
Recovery and Analysis.”

37:51.562 --> 37:54.645
I knew no matter how careful I was,
I’d never get away with killin’ him.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.346
At least
not with y’all around.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.398
I’d like to think
that’s true.

the straight and narrow.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.152
I haven’t so much as
talked in church since.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.108
What happened
to your stepfather?

38:08.245 --> 38:13.785
Last time I saw him,
I told him he was a dead man
if he ever touched my mama again.

38:13.876 --> 38:16.868
Guess the son of a bitch
didn’t know I was bluffin’.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.630

how it must feel...

38:21.717 --> 38:25.881

are thinking that you
did something like that.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.056

38:45.741 --> 38:48.574
Dr. Brennan,
take a look at this.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.658
Eggs from a parasite?

38:53.749 --> 38:55.285
Good job, Opie.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.206
Dr. Hodgins!

38:57.294 --> 38:59.000
No, I don’t mind,
Dr. Saroyan.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.373
Truth be told,
after walkin’ out,

39:01.465 --> 39:04.047
I deserve whatever Thurston here
chooses to deal out.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.125
- Thurston?
- Yeah.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.711
Opie and l have
a little understanding.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.262
So, our parasite...

39:11.350 --> 39:13.807
is a Paragon/mus westermani.

39:15.312 --> 39:16.392
It’s a lung fluke.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.392
The lung fluke
isn’t found in the US.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.974
Opie, you’re like
the little brother
lneverhad.

39:22.069 --> 39:24.151
Much obliged, Thurston.

39:24.238 --> 39:28.197
In Japan, however,
the lung fluke is endemic to 80%
of their freshwater crabs.

39:28.283 --> 39:32.572
- Had the victim been to Japan?
- No. But she knew
someone who had.

39:32.663 --> 39:35.200
You said you hadn’t seen Tina
in a month, correct?

39:35.290 --> 39:38.248
That’s correct.
Since I got back
from Japan.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.666
I regret that now.

39:39.795 --> 39:42.958
She was so dear to me.
Right. You picked up
a parasite in Japan.

That’s how you
developed the cough.

39:45.467 --> 39:46.923

That’s all.

39:47.010 --> 39:50.047
This is a prescription of yours
for bithionol.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.674
It’s for the parasite,
isn’t it?

39:53.684 --> 39:56.096
Uh, h-how did you get this?

39:56.186 --> 39:57.892
My medical information
is private.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.561
Not during
a murder investigation.

39:59.648 --> 40:02.731
The same parasite
that was found in Tina’s body.

40:02.818 --> 40:05.776
There’s only one way
it could’ve got there, Mitch.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.648
This is crazy.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.902
She was the golden goose.
Why would I kill the golden goose?

40:10.993 --> 40:13.154
Because she was quittin’
to have a baby.

40:13.245 --> 40:16.612
And that contract that you
signed with the Japanese...

40:16.707 --> 40:19.540
was worthless without Tina.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.504
We had a deal.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.133
And I got mad.

40:30.846 --> 40:32.211
And | shoved her.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.921
I’m a big man.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.008
She just flew into that thing.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.522
But all I did
was give her a shove.

40:54.036 --> 40:55.776

40:55.871 --> 41:00.456
I don’t want to see you
wearing that baseball cap
in the lab anymore.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.874
Uh, yes, ma’am.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.462
I’m sorry about that.

41:05.464 --> 41:08.422

wore this one.

41:11.887 --> 41:14.299

has been successful.

put myself in your shoes
