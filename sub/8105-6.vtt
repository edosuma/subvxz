WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:06.089
As the riders
begin Lap Two, Jeff Forster
is leading the pack.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.590
Theyre jockeying
for position, now...

00:11.178 --> 00:12.053
This is so cool.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.346
Did we miss anything?

00:13.472 --> 00:15.473
They've got, like,
11 laps to go.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.518
We gotta find a good place
where we can see the sign
when he goes by.

00:18.644 --> 00:19.602
Wait up, kids!

00:20.896 --> 00:24.232
There is
a strong chase pack forming
led by Vernonski...

00:25.192 --> 00:27.777
At this point in the race,
things are still
too close to call.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.071
It's anybody's race,
but Forster looks...

00:32.157 --> 00:33.825
Turn six. Come on.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.914
Mike Larson has made
a nice break from the pack

00:40.040 --> 00:42.375
and has closed the gap
on Forster and the lead group.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.051
That's it. Up there.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.637
Can you see anything?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.307
Did you bring his inhaler?

00:58.434 --> 00:59.517
Crap!

00:59.643 --> 01:02.478
I think it's in the car.
I'll go get it.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.446
Are you okay?
Your dad's gonna
be right back...

01:11.572 --> 01:12.864
I can see him.
He's right up front.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.198
Honey, you're wheezing.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.909
Here they come.
Go, Jeff! Yeah!

01:17.244 --> 01:18.661
You're number one!

01:19.288 --> 01:20.496
He doesn't look so good.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.594
Ladies and gentlemen,
Forster is down.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.764
Yeah!

02:20.224 --> 02:21.766
We need to talk.

02:22.392 --> 02:26.687
Oh, God. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I
really wanna finish high school.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.106
You have to renew
your credential.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.733
They're good
for two more months.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.693
Three weeks.
And the paperwork
takes forever.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.905
Your application,
your malpractice insurance,

02:36.031 --> 02:38.783
criminal records check and you know
that's gonna take some explaining.

02:38.909 --> 02:42.328
You know, our relationship was way
better when we were sleeping together.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.163
Why did we stop doing that?
Did you get married?

02:44.289 --> 02:47.208
Yeah. Otherwise I'd be on you
like red on rice.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.086
Look, rice isn't...
Oh, I get it.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.921
You're also behind
on your dictations.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.422
I don't do dictations.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.882
Cameron does them,
or somebody.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.051
And you can't have your sole
female employee

02:57.177 --> 02:59.637
doing your clerical work,
which you'd know
if you'd attended

02:59.763 --> 03:01.597
the required
sexual harassment seminars.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.684
Now, I'm gonna pause
so you can make a crack
about harassment.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.810
Joke killer.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.020
House, got a patient.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.525
Sorry. Can't play anymore.
My mom's calling me.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.238
We just admitted
a world-class cyclist.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.866
- You gotta fire Stacy.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.494
Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest
at 30 miles per hour.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.955
She's loading me up
with pointless paperwork.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.249
Well, you're way behind
on your pointless paperwork.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.501
- O2 sats are in the...
- She's hostile.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.754
You know me,
hostility makes me
shrink up like a...

03:34.590 --> 03:36.632
I can't think of
a non-sexual metaphor.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.552
She's gonna stand
over my desk with a ruler,
checking my spelling...

03:39.678 --> 03:41.137
ER checked
for lung infiltrates.
Nothing there.

03:41.263 --> 03:45.182
Professional athletes,
Cuddy. It's like watching
an old movie at 2 a.m.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.893
Reliving all the
classic moments.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.854
The part where
he denies it's drugs.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.106
The part where the good guys
ride in, tests a-blazing,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.774
prove that it is drugs.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.028
Oscar clip. He can't imagine
how they got into his body.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.196
It's so familiar,
so comforting.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.781
She can't handle
working with me.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.366
Oh, right. Yeah.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.286
She's still got a thing for you,
making it impossible for her to deal.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.538
It makes perfect sense,
except for the pronouns.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.916
Anyway, thanks for getting me
out of that meeting.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.711
He's not denying
the drugs.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.800
I'm thinking
he's actually sick.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.473
Jeff Forster, this is...

04:25.599 --> 04:28.309
I'm a doctor.
You're a sick person.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.021
And you are a loved one.
Actually, manager.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.606
We've been together
for 7 years.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.567
So what's the drug du jour
on the bike circuit
these days?

04:36.693 --> 04:39.987
Still erythropoietin,
or are you guys
just chugging battery acid?

04:40.113 --> 04:44.617
There's no way I'd touch EPO.
Too many guys stroking out and dying.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.785
Damn.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.454
10 bucks for the ticket,
six for the popcorn.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.498
I do straight blood doping.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.666
Plot twist.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.044
That's a very daring
confession.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.837
We've got confidentiality,
right?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.256
Assuming I'm more ethical
than your client.

04:59.925 --> 05:04.095
So, injecting yourself
with donor red blood cells
for fun and profit.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.722
Any other tricks
up your sleeve?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.474
Well, nothing much
recently.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.769
I'm in town for a charity ride,
so it didn't matter if I won.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.270
The kids just needed
to see me.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.481
If you go slower,
they see you longer.

05:15.983 --> 05:20.236
Let's say our health could be affected
by things we did before last Friday.

05:21.321 --> 05:26.951
Well, I usually sleep
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.246
I've been pumping up
electrolytes with an IV drip.

05:30.372 --> 05:34.959
Anabolic herbal supplements,
amphetamines and diuretics.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.962
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But why would you be sick?

05:38.088 --> 05:42.216
I know that doping has risks.
I know that it's outside the rules.

05:42.843 --> 05:47.680
But I do what I have to
to kick ass at my job.
Don't you?

05:48.140 --> 05:51.767
Dr. House is a firm believer
in good old-fashioned
hard work.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.690
This guy
doesn't even get sick
like a regular person.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.984
Instead of a list of symptoms
and no cause,

06:00.110 --> 06:03.070
we have a list
of possible causes
for one symptom.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.114
Is the symptom death?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.699
Respiratory distress.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.076
Insanity doesn't cause it.
I looked it up.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.705
It's the doping.
Injecting extra red cells
boosts your endurance level

06:12.831 --> 06:14.373
but it also
thickens your blood.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.834
Thick blood equals clots
equals respiratory distress.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.836
Not with a clean
spiral chest CT.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.713
The guy's sleeping
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.631
Over-oxygenation
can cause cell damage,

06:22.758 --> 06:24.133
and if the cells
in the lungs are damaged...

06:24.259 --> 06:26.260
That'd cause pulmonary edema,
which he doesn't have.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.679
The supplements
he's been taking
contain yohimbe

06:28.805 --> 06:30.473
which can cause
nerve paralysis.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.849
Tox-screen was normal.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.309
All the tests were normal.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.021
There's no clot,
no edema, and yet
he still can't breathe.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.815
So there's something in here
that we can't see.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.445
Air.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.613
Come to Papa.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.074
This guy's been
injecting himself
how many times a day?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.701
All it'd take is
one slip of the needle
to cause an air embolus.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.620
So, air is keeping him
from breathing air.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.288
Well, let's go with that
for the irony.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.166
Get a VQ scan
and check his veins
for bubbles.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.006
Xenon 133.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.635
It's just radioactive enough
for us to track the air
moving through your lungs.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.095
Was my accident
on the news?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.222
Yeah, you made
Plays of the Week.

07:11.348 --> 07:15.309
A few more of those,
and cycling will be
as popular as NASCAR.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.355
We inject similar stuff
into your blood
so we can watch it circulate.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.733
If you accidentally
injected a bubble,

07:22.859 --> 07:25.194
we'll see good air flow
but poor blood flow.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.071
I'm careful, man.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.740
With all due respect, man,

07:30.158 --> 07:33.661
I doubt there's anything
wrong with you that you
didn't do to yourself.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.917
There's this kid in oncology,
she's got a picture of Jeff
above her bed.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.462
Mickey Mantle
was an alcoholic.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.839
At least he hit
his own home runs.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.799
He didn't physically
alter himself.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.552
We take drugs
to help us fall asleep,
to stay awake...

07:49.678 --> 07:52.054
Yeah, but we don't
make careers out of who
can stay awake the longest.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.850
Really? Ever been to, oh,
I don't know, med school?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.686
Guys, he plays a game
for a living. Who cares?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.229
You don't even like sports.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.606
He's making
millions of dollars
ripping off fans.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.900
Anyone who thinks
they should pay a guy money

08:05.026 --> 08:07.778
because he can
throw a ball really far
or pedal really fast

08:07.904 --> 08:10.948
- deserves to be ripped off.
- Yeah, stupid, stupid kids.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.618
I've got an uncle.
He can spit a cherry pit
50 yards.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.037
He's working part-time
at a lube shop.
Life isn't fair.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.750
Maybe it is.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.919
You were right.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.256
Now, there were
three wasted words.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.926
There is a bubble in his lung.
We should do a Swan-Ganz
catheterization.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.512
I love when you do
both sides of the
conversation.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.806
It's like white noise.
It's very peaceful.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.319
Is there a light
somewhere that goes on
when I have food?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.531
Green for food,
orange for beverages,
red for impure thoughts.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.034
That bulb burns out
every two weeks.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.243
How's your biker?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.996
Pumped an air bubble
into a vein in his lung.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.957
The things people do.
Doping, Vicodin...

09:02.083 --> 09:04.585
Hey, you're talking about me,
aren't you?

09:05.962 --> 09:09.215
I'm just trying to function.
He's trying to win himself
some little yellow jerseys.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.717
Oh.

09:11.843 --> 09:12.843
What?

09:12.969 --> 09:15.346
Trouble in paradise.
2 o'clock.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.514
Your 2 o'clock
or my 2 o'clock?

09:17.641 --> 09:18.724
There.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.773
She seems perfectly happy.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.651
Obviously they
huddled in the hall and
worked up this circus act

09:28.777 --> 09:29.985
on the off chance
you'd be in here.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.946
She was unbelievably pissy
three hours ago.

09:32.072 --> 09:32.947
Hmm.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.491
Pissy with you,
happy with her husband.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.993
Yes, there can only be
one possible explanation
for that.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.287
When she's angry
she gets sarcastic.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.956
When she's annoyed
she's funny.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.791
But when she's frustrated
she gets pissy.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.709
Yes, yes,
I'm with you so far.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.712
She's miserable with Mark
because he's not me.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.422
So she's gotta make me
not me,

09:50.548 --> 09:51.966
so she makes
my professional life
miserable.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.302
- If I can't do my job...
- You really, really need to get some...

09:55.428 --> 09:57.596
Oh, I get some
"some" all the time.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.599
It's why I always need
to borrow some money.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.271
Hi, James.
Greg, you gotten
to that paperwork?

10:05.855 --> 10:06.897
I've been pissy.

10:07.023 --> 10:07.856
Pardon me?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.025
I've been busy.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.237
When you save someone's life,
they owe you forever.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.531
You're right. Take Stacy.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.701
Oh, wait, she'd probably
just leave you all over again.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.079
How's your recovery going?
Gotten around to the
small muscles yet?

10:22.205 --> 10:25.666
It's not the size
of the muscle,
it's where you get to put it.

10:25.917 --> 10:30.170
My goodness, it's like
watching Oscar Wilde and Noel
Coward in the third grade.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.547
Excuse us.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.386
How awkward was that?

10:38.221 --> 10:41.557
What's he doing here anyway?
He's got physio
Tuesdays and Fridays.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.102
Mark is in group therapy
for people coping with
disability.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.104
He was thinking about
developing a drug addiction,

10:47.230 --> 10:51.150
- but that would be stupid.
- Hey, you're... You, again.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.447
You're not gonna
make some joke about
Mark being in therapy?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.076
What's there to say? He's
doing the responsible thing.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.039
I'm sure he's got
a lot to deal with.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.874
You're making me nervous.

11:09.544 --> 11:13.922
Every time
an athlete goes down,
you guys assume it's drugs.

11:14.215 --> 11:18.010
Look, the doctors say
it's probably acid reflux.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.680
Yeah, look, call me tomorrow.
There's a good chance
he'll be released.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.265
Okay. Bye-bye.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.434
So, is this fixing him?

11:25.560 --> 11:28.187
If his acid reflux isn't worse
than we thought, yeah.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.898
I gotta be in Spain
in four days.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.816
Shouldn't be a problem.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.068
Great.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.279
If I could just
find the little bugger,
should be able to suck it out.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.870
My legs feel weak.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.832
You're under mild sedation
for the test. It'll wear off.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.085
There it is.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.720
- Got it.
- Fantastic, I'll pack his things.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.890
Not yet. I wanna monitor him
for a couple of hours,
make sure he's okay.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.310
Give him time
to sign a picture for me,
maybe even a jersey.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.604
"To Doctor Chase,
I owe you everything."

12:10.730 --> 12:12.523
It doesn't
have to be that personal.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.818
Not too many eBay shoppers
named Doctor Chase, huh?

12:16.444 --> 12:19.238
Still trying to unload
the Barbara Walters spit cup.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.531
Here you go.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.663
Seriously,
anything's fine.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.291
Jeff!

12:32.961 --> 12:34.044
You all right?

12:35.046 --> 12:36.588
Jeff, can you swallow?

12:38.883 --> 12:41.427
What makes a guy
start drooling?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.305
Chase, were you wearing
your short shorts?

12:45.432 --> 12:47.599
Muscle fatigue
in his neck and jaw.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.685
He's obviously
got something worse
than an air embolus.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.811
Why?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.688
Because you don't
drool from your lungs?

12:52.814 --> 12:56.400
Maybe the problem
is not the embolus itself.
Maybe it's the treatment.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.735
Maybe you hit a nerve,
literally.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.532
The embolectomy was clean.
His legs were tired, too.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.993
I thought it was
from the sedation,
but if not,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.327
it means he's got
something systemic.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.289
Which means it would have
nothing to do with
the stunts he's been pulling.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.460
Lupus or polymyositis.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.295
It explains the progressive
muscle weakness.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.421
It could be ALS.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.505
He's too young for that.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.132
Some type of
muscular dystrophy?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.508
He's too old for that.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.594
So what would be
just right, Goldilocks?

13:24.512 --> 13:27.473
Full blood workup,
including ANA for lupus.

13:27.599 --> 13:31.810
And get a muscle biopsy.
Find out if we're talking
myopathy or neuropathy.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.521
I'm late for my session.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.522
Session?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.525
It's all a part
of the process.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.152
You get angry
and then you get...

13:40.278 --> 13:42.654
Yeah. I'm right on schedule.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.781
So, when am I gonna be done?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.451
No, I need to know,
'cause I got plans to make.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.078
When can I safely
book a game of squash?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.247
When am I gonna
stop being angry?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.540
Not today.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.669
I've come for the healing.

13:58.463 --> 14:03.217
Dr. Harper, as you know,
I have a bum leg.

14:04.135 --> 14:08.472
What you don't know is
I'm upset about it.
I need to talk.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.391
You know House.
You know we have a history.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.852
You've been
telling me for years
that I should come by.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.563
Here I am. Hi, guys.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.024
- I've got a Thursday group.
- Poker night.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.193
- Monday morning?
- Book club.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.781
Well, look, if it's a problem,
I'll just go deal with my rage
privately.

14:25.907 --> 14:26.907
Wait.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.284
If you two could
resolve this tension,

14:29.410 --> 14:31.245
you could really
help each other.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.998
I'm tired of fighting.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.213
So either I say yes
or I'm the jerk?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.465
Oh, God, I know that feeling.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.136
I took the muscle specimen
from Jeff's thigh.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.722
I figured that's where
we'd have the best chance
at finding something.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.808
The most painful place
to cut into.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.562
I assume
that's caffeine-free.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.147
Wouldn't want to be
artificially boosting
your performance.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.566
Don't start her up again.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.984
Caffeine's legal.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.361
All about the rules, eh?

15:04.487 --> 15:06.196
It's a bike race,

15:06.573 --> 15:09.032
a completely
arbitrary set of rules
that everyone complies with

15:09.158 --> 15:11.868
for no other reason than that
some committee says
that they should.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.204
But that's the point.
That's what the game is.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.499
So, if you
break an arbitrary rule,
Cameron damns you to hell.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.459
But if you break a rule
that actually has a reason

15:19.586 --> 15:20.794
that's designed
to protect people,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.921
Cameron develops
a crazy crush on you.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.424
House doesn't pretend
to be some golden boy.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.384
He does it to help people,
not to glorify himself.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.720
So why don't you report Jeff
to the biking authorities?

15:30.722 --> 15:31.722
Ethics.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.849
Well, you
wouldn't be doing it
to glorify yourself.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.601
You'd just be trying
to make a better world.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.105
At least you can
still get around
on your own.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.232
Yeah, I know.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.444
But you're starting to walk.
You're gonna get better.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.572
You have a job,
a way to be productive.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.157
And you have a wife.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.159
Which gives greater meaning?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.496
A wife could
make things harder, too,
I suppose.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.875
This isn't about Stacy.

16:00.877 --> 16:04.338
When it happened to me,
Stacy was great.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.715
She kept telling me
not to rush it.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.760
I never believed her.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.803
She means it.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.431
I know, but...

16:16.017 --> 16:19.019
Stacy. She shouldn't
have to wait, right?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.229
And you know
she feels it, too.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.652
There's more time at work.
There's more satisfaction
from work.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.196
She didn't get married
to be a nursemaid.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.574
She wants a man.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.252
How the hell could she
have loved a manipulative
son of a bitch like you?

16:44.379 --> 16:45.629
That's an interesting
question.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.548
Maybe she was attracted
to different things
in the two of us.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.675
She left you.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.093
But why was she with me
to begin with?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.929
- She made a mistake.
- Maybe it's that simple.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.514
Or maybe she saw
something in me,

16:55.640 --> 16:57.140
something she doesn't get
from you.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.476
- I'm not an ass.
- Maybe she wanted an ass.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.937
- She obviously did once.
- Either he goes or I go.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.605
You think
that's the kind of thing
you can just turn off?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.942
- Get him out of here!
- Dr. House, cancel your book group.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.568
You're coming on Mondays.

17:13.074 --> 17:17.452
Here's my new theory.
The drooling's another
competitive edge.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.705
Nobody can draft behind it.
The road gets slick.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.415
He's the only one
not racing in the rain.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.500
He can barely move
his arms and legs.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.586
- Paralysis?
- No, just general weakness.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.714
Muscle biopsy is negative
for polymyositis.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.258
And ALS
and muscular dystrophy.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.427
ANA for lupus,
also negative.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.303
Maybe his bike shorts
are just on too tight.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.056
So, by your rationale,
House shouldn't use a cane.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.517
He should just drag
his bum leg around
as God intended?

17:40.643 --> 17:43.854
House has a handicap.
All he's aiming for
is normality.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.605
And who decides
what's normal?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.066
What if we find a drug
that makes people live
20 years longer?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.526
Should we ban that
because it's not normal?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.820
Jeff doesn't want normal.
He wants superpowers.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.282
- So why is he normal?
- Oh, God, you too?

17:55.825 --> 17:58.493
He's shooting
for extraordinary.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.870
So why is everything
so ordinary?

17:59.996 --> 18:03.123
I mean, this guy's breathing,
drinking and injecting himself

18:03.249 --> 18:05.459
with everything he can find
to amp up his body chemistry,

18:05.585 --> 18:06.626
and yet every test is normal.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.338
He's artificially raising
his red blood count,
so why isn't it raised?

18:10.465 --> 18:11.798
Maybe his count is raised.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.801
Maybe what's normal for us
is out of whack for him.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.636
Can't slip anything by you.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.764
Well, if that's true,
his white cells are up, too.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.599
Which would point
to some kind of infection.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.102
Muscle weakness, exhaustion.
He could have encephalitis.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.271
- That's kind of a long shot.
- Yeah.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.356
But it's been over an hour
since we've poked the patient

18:28.483 --> 18:31.193
with something sharp.
So, get a lumbar puncture

18:31.360 --> 18:33.361
and order broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.364
No, it's not about judging.

18:36.491 --> 18:40.160
It's just that
on a dating service
you should post a photo.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.537
I have to go.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.291
- I am so sorry to bother you.
- Nope, not a problem.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.919
I was just accounting.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.796
I'm Jeff Forster's manager.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.464
He's been here a whole day,

18:52.590 --> 18:55.300
and it doesn't seem
like we're any closer
to a diagnosis.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.344
Jeff Forster.
A whole day, huh?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.470
Mmm-hmm.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.140
I was just wondering
if I could help
speed things up.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.435
Your client's
had a muscle biopsy,
a full blood workup

19:05.561 --> 19:08.063
and he's scheduled
for a lumbar puncture
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.689
Jeff is in the Lucas Wing.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.400
If Mr. Lucas showed up
needing a lumbar puncture,

19:12.527 --> 19:14.110
would he have to
wait until tomorrow?

19:14.237 --> 19:16.363
- Mr. Lucas is dead.
- Good.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.447
Then there's an opening.

19:19.784 --> 19:23.203
Jeff is used to doing
whatever he has to
to be first, isn't he?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.788
It's been
very lucrative for him.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.791
He feels it's important
that he give something back.

19:28.042 --> 19:31.670
I hear you've been
raising funds for your
nuclear medicine department

19:34.674 --> 19:35.715
or whatever.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.269
Thank you, guys,
for working so late.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.520
Glad to be here.

19:50.314 --> 19:53.316
The lumbar puncture
will tell us what kind of
infection you've got.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.819
In the meantime,
we're administering
antibiotics.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.739
Do you like being a hero?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.451
It's a living.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.412
You don't feel
a sense of responsibility?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.872
There's kids out there
that worship you.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.210
When I was a rookie
on the tour,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.672
I got a letter
from a guy in Wisconsin.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.967
He wanted me
to send a note to his son.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.720
He said he worshipped me.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.265
You know what worship means?
I looked it up.

20:27.143 --> 20:31.563
It means to love
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.860
So the kid
doesn't even know me,
but he loves me

20:37.361 --> 20:39.654
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.532
So you decided
to take advantage of that.

20:43.409 --> 20:48.121
What should I have done?
"Dear sir, I'm just a guy

20:48.539 --> 20:50.415
who rides a bike pretty good.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.543
You and your kid
are out of your minds."

20:56.505 --> 20:57.589
My arms feel funny.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.429
The sats are dropping.
He's in respiratory arrest.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.764
He can't be. We fixed that.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.599
Apparently not.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.574
So glad we cured
his respiratory arrest.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.077
It freed him up to develop
respiratory arrest.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.995
LP was negative
for encephalitis.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.372
The white count's
still the same,

21:30.498 --> 21:32.832
but the red count's
fallen to 29%.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.167
What was my theory yesterday?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.044
That I screwed up
the embolectomy.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.047
We'll get a chest x-ray
to check.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.423
I didn't screw up.
Why would you...

21:40.549 --> 21:42.926
How can you
be so petty, Chase?
He's down a quart.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.679
Either he's losing blood
because you nicked something

21:45.805 --> 21:46.930
or he's just
not producing blood,

21:47.056 --> 21:49.015
in which case,
we're talking acute anemia

21:49.141 --> 21:50.183
combined with
a muscular disorder.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.060
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

21:52.186 --> 21:54.646
Either you screwed up
or he's got cancer.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.780
I think I should
start smoking again.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.992
You want a medical opinion
supporting that decision?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.077
The symptoms started
as soon as I quit.

22:09.203 --> 22:12.664
Symptoms meaning diarrhea.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.084
- A lot of diarrhea.
- 10 or 12 times a day.

22:16.210 --> 22:19.504
It's really embarrassing.
I'm a flight attendant and...

22:22.133 --> 22:23.758
Well, on the up side,
my hiccups are gone.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.176
You went to his group.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.014
Well, you were the one
who was all, "Greg, you need
to confront your feelings".

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
That was five years ago.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.307
Well, I've been pissy.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.102
Fine, you don't want help.
Does that mean
nobody should get it?

22:34.228 --> 22:37.856
Mark's looking for help
because, what, he's
resentful, overwhelmed?

22:37.982 --> 22:40.108
- I'm asking because I care.
- Not about him.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.694
You still wanna jump me,
so you don't care
whose marriage...

22:42.820 --> 22:44.904
Listen,
I can get my rocks off
any time I want.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.781
What I don't seem
to be able to do
is my job

22:46.907 --> 22:48.491
without you hanging over
my shoulder.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.290
How many packs?

22:56.208 --> 22:59.794
A bit over one a day,
but they were lights,
and I quit.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.380
You used to go out with her?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.548
Yeah.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.216
What was I thinking?

23:05.760 --> 23:09.637
I'm talking about the gum
you're chewing to replace
smoking as an oral fixation.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.098
- How many packs?
- Six, maybe seven.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.684
I'm trying to protect you.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.812
Cuddy and I may be
the only people stopping you
from jumping off a cliff...

23:17.938 --> 23:20.398
- You're pissy.
- Oh, I am angry!

23:20.524 --> 23:22.525
- You get pissy when you're frustrated.
- Shut up.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.069
Okay, I'm wrong.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.655
This is unbelievably
difficult for Mark,
which you should know.

23:27.865 --> 23:31.117
Which you should be
able to summon up
some level of empathy for.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.037
Right. The crippled boys.
We should start a band.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.206
I have a good thing with Mark.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.833
We are handling this
the best way we know how.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.668
And none of this has
anything to do with me?

23:40.795 --> 23:44.923
No, nothing, except that
you can't or won't
just let it go.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.885
Let it go.

23:56.685 --> 23:57.977
You're being poisoned.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.313
By gum?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.608
Sugarless gum uses sorbitol
as a sweetener.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.569
We use sorbitol as a laxative.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.662
This will tell you
if he's got cancer
in his blood?

24:16.163 --> 24:18.581
If he does, we'll see
abnormal cells in the marrow.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.668
How long
will the tests take?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.586
I'll get them in
as soon as I can.

24:24.839 --> 24:28.299
And if he
doesn't have cancer,
what else could it be?

24:28.425 --> 24:31.302
It's possible some damage
was done during one of
the tests we gave him.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.180
So either one of your doctors
screwed up a simple procedure

24:34.306 --> 24:35.557
or he's got cancer.

24:36.183 --> 24:39.060
We can't know
anything for sure
until the biopsy comes back.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.189
It stings, I know.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.899
No, he wants the tube out.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.151
I can't do that, Jeff.

24:46.277 --> 24:49.445
If you wanna
say something, you've gotta
write it down. Okay?

24:50.030 --> 24:51.156
Here.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.133
If it's cancer, it's possible.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.218
There's no way
to know for sure.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.642
Phone not working?

25:20.853 --> 25:24.647
One of the morgue attendants
asked me to bring this to you.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.736
Wonder why they're calling me.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.862
Yeah, me too, actually.

25:30.988 --> 25:35.283
I was wondering why the Times
was returning your call.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.995
You a doctor
or the bicycle police?

25:39.246 --> 25:42.832
He's cheating.
He shouldn't get away with it.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.295
Have you actually
told them anything yet?

25:47.421 --> 25:48.421
You worried
about the precedent?

25:48.547 --> 25:49.923
I'm worried about you.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.132
You gonna turn me in?

25:52.509 --> 25:53.593
No.

25:56.180 --> 26:00.058
He's made a mistake.
Revealing the truth
doesn't undo it.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.978
Kids love him, and he's not
who they think he is.
It's not right.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.481
Who cares if he's
what he says he is?
Who the hell is?

26:07.608 --> 26:10.818
If love is based on lies,
does that mean
it's not a real feeling?

26:10.945 --> 26:12.946
It doesn't bring
the same pleasure?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.781
Are we still talking
about the patient?

26:20.037 --> 26:22.664
Have you ever cheated?

26:29.004 --> 26:30.338
Well, I have.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.215
You wanna punish him?
Good for you.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.051
But you can't do it
without punishing
the people who love him.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.011
Is that how you justified
lying to your wives?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.390
I always told them.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.771
Well, he's negative
for bleeds.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.732
Congratulations, Chase.
It's cancer.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.654
Clean him up
and let oncology have him.
It's their party now.

26:54.822 --> 26:58.574
He doesn't have cancer.
Biopsy shows he's got
pure red cell aplasia.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.869
There's no way PRCA
could manifest so suddenly.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.123
Unless it's drug-induced.
He's lying about
not being on EPO.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.791
Why would he lie?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.126
What does it matter?

27:09.420 --> 27:13.131
People lie
for thousands of reasons.
But there's always a reason.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.675
Philosophically interesting,
medically irrelevant.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.176
Unless he's not lying.

27:21.932 --> 27:25.310
You've got a leak.
The press is all over
the Jeff Forster story.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.854
On the off chance
that one of you was
stupid enough to call

27:27.980 --> 27:29.981
from your own office, I'm
pulling your phone records,

27:30.107 --> 27:31.399
including your cell phones.

27:31.525 --> 27:34.777
I assume if I point out
the fact that you have
no right to do that,

27:34.903 --> 27:36.404
you'll interpret that
as a sign of guilt?

27:36.530 --> 27:40.074
Wilson's chatty,
plus he's got
two ex-wives to support.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.326
You want me to tell him
he's fired?

27:41.452 --> 27:44.412
Until we figure out
who's behind this,
I'm sitting in with you guys.

27:44.538 --> 27:47.540
You have the ethics
of a 4-year-old. I'm gonna
treat you like one.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.918
How am I supposed
to practice medicine with a
lawyer sitting on my shoulder?

27:51.045 --> 27:53.296
- Responsibly.
- You know I can't do that.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.132
Cameron.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.091
I'm not the leak.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.802
Somebody once told me
that everybody lies,

27:59.928 --> 28:01.888
and since
you're the only people
who know he has cancer...

28:02.014 --> 28:02.972
He doesn't have cancer.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.016
The point is,
you're his medical team.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.143
He's threatening to sue.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.978
Why would Cameron
leak cancer?

28:10.230 --> 28:12.273
How does cancer
make the guy look bad?

28:18.072 --> 28:19.238
He's on EPO.

28:21.784 --> 28:25.620
Your anemia is caused
by pure red cell aplasia.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.290
This is gonna hurt,
but we gotta talk.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.625
What the hell are you doing?

28:30.751 --> 28:31.834
He'll be fine, sort of.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.671
I just don't have time
to watch him
write out answers.

28:37.049 --> 28:41.010
PRCA comes in two varieties,
chronic and acute.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.055
Since it came on fast,
you have the acute version.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.264
He doesn't have cancer.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.475
Is the good news.
The bad news is

28:48.227 --> 28:49.894
pants are on fire.

28:50.396 --> 28:54.273
Acute PRCA is caused by drugs,
most commonly, EPO.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.235
Ready, and action!

28:57.361 --> 28:59.695
But I haven't used EPO.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.324
Okay, but this time,
with more anger.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.910
Remember, this guy's
accusing you of cheating.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.454
I haven't used that stuff.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.876
I believed it.
It was simple, it was pure.
Did you believe it?

29:14.211 --> 29:17.088
I guess it's silly
to cast someone
after the first audition.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.006
- Why don't you do a reading?
- Give me that.

29:19.133 --> 29:22.176
- He doesn't do EPO.
- What did you think?

29:22.302 --> 29:25.388
It's a different way to go,
but, I don't know,
I just didn't buy it.

29:25.556 --> 29:26.931
Does she handle
any of your injections?

29:27.057 --> 29:29.016
You think
I'm giving it to him?

29:29.143 --> 29:30.560
Test him.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.228
Gee, that's a great idea.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.858
I sure hope that EPO's not
one of those drugs that's
undetectable after six hours.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.111
Hey, you know
what we can test for?
Phone calls.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.030
Take her cell phone.
Push the redial button.

29:43.157 --> 29:45.241
Even money says
you'll be connected
to the newspaper

29:45.367 --> 29:46.451
that leaked your cancer story.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.203
Okay.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.332
Okay, I should have
told you.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.585
It's not just about
the races, Jeff.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.336
It's about your image, okay?

29:57.671 --> 30:02.091
If you come back
from cancer, those sponsors
will be all over you.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.513
Okay, so I messed up. Okay?
But I did not give you EPO.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.932
That stuff could kill me.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.519
Come on,
give her a break.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.855
She was only doing
what she has to
to advance her career.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.940
Don't you have that tattooed
on your tushie?

30:18.358 --> 30:21.319
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.571
Who are you gonna believe,

30:23.822 --> 30:25.781
the manager you've trusted
for years?

30:27.743 --> 30:28.910
I've been to college.

30:37.419 --> 30:38.711
You're fired.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.763
Okay.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.100
You're basing this
whole diagnosis, everything,

30:53.352 --> 30:56.854
on the idea that I was
slipping him illegal drugs.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.362
You're gonna kill him.

31:17.584 --> 31:21.337
If Doctor House is so sure,
why do you need to stay?

31:21.463 --> 31:23.464
He's a very cautious man.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.717
Your breathing's better.
Let the prednisone do its job.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.302
Get some sleep.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.021
Jeff?

31:49.116 --> 31:51.993
His red blood cell count
plummeted to 16%.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.496
He passed out,
had to be resuscitated, and
he still can't move his legs.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.374
That's not possible.
The drugs should be
flushing out of his system.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.418
Can't leave
if they don't exist.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.421
The EPO use explains
every one of his symptoms.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.132
He's been lying and cheating,
and now it's coming back
to bite him.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.968
The only problem
with that theory is
it's based on the assumption

32:09.094 --> 32:10.845
that the universe
is a just place.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.098
If it were, then his
poor manager wouldn't have
been fired for no reason.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.225
- Lambert-Eaton.
- His chest was clear.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.644
So we run
an electromyography test.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.980
You're still not explaining
the PRCA.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.440
What's his red count now?

32:22.566 --> 32:23.774
I had to give him
a blood transfusion.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.359
He's back around 30.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.570
He needed a transfusion?

32:27.738 --> 32:31.240
Well, he was losing blood,
so, I thought maybe
he needed blood.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.871
Go forth and scan his neck.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.080
His neck?

32:38.498 --> 32:41.125
Or repeat everything I say
in question form.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.723
She came into the clinic
and yelled at me.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.144
Then she left, she came back
and yelled some more.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.479
Hmm.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.649
Yelling.
That might be a clue.

33:05.108 --> 33:09.278
I know what the yelling means.
It's the coming and going
I find interesting.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.530
- It's not rational.
- Anger is not rational.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.074
Some anger is.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.077
She could have
pulled me aside,
screamed at me privately.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.497
Her beef is simple
and well founded.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.832
But she was out of control.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.459
You're having fun, aren't you?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.628
She's in my face.
I need to know why.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.171
Professional reasons.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.339
Why else?

33:30.258 --> 33:33.511
Do you really think
this is going to end well
for anyone?

33:38.934 --> 33:42.561
After this,
let's scan some other
totally random body parts.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.480
50 bucks says
we find something.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.191
Find what?

33:47.484 --> 33:49.694
Don't have a clue. We on?

33:49.820 --> 33:50.653
No way.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.617
No. We'll find something.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.709
- We found a thymoma.
- How'd you know to look in his neck?

34:04.835 --> 34:06.502
Thymoma's usually present
in the chest.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.379
I knew it wasn't
in his chest.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.215
All we've done
since he checked in
is look at his chest.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.009
- All the more reason not to think...
- There are two types of PRCA.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.846
Acute comes on suddenly,
chronic takes its time.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.932
We all thought Jeff's
was acute because it happened
right in front of us.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.685
But what if it'd been there
for months, maybe years?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.645
There's no way.
It would have kept him
from racing.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.605
With that kind of anemia,
he would have needed
constant...

34:28.900 --> 34:30.025
Blood transfusions.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.695
Which he was getting
in convenient
blood doping form.

34:32.863 --> 34:34.864
He was treating himself
without even knowing it.

34:34.990 --> 34:38.492
Up to half of patients
with chronic PRCA
have a thymoma.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.120
And up to half of patients
with a thymoma...

34:42.164 --> 34:44.123
I've always
wanted to do this.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.261
I'm not getting any better.
Does that mean I'm...

35:00.098 --> 35:02.767
You are healed. Rise and walk.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.518
Are you insane?

35:04.644 --> 35:06.645
In the Bible,
people just say, "Yes, Lord",

35:06.772 --> 35:08.647
and then start right in
on the praising.

35:09.232 --> 35:12.359
First you tell me
I've got cancer.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.697
And then you tell me
that my manager...

35:30.587 --> 35:31.629
What did you do?

35:31.922 --> 35:34.131
No, "What did you do, Lord?"

35:34.424 --> 35:36.884
Thymoma is a tumor
on the thymus gland.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.845
He's a bit of a wimp,
but he hangs with
the tough guys.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.557
PRCA and an autoimmune disease
called myasthenia gravis.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.018
MG causes muscle fatigue

35:46.144 --> 35:49.063
including respiratory problems
and difficulty swallowing.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.774
And it can hit you
that fast?

35:51.900 --> 35:54.276
The treatment for PRCA
is blood transfusions.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.529
The treatment for MG
is hyperbaria.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.490
You were doing both
as part of your regular
freak show.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.659
When you took a break,
everything went to hell,

36:01.827 --> 36:04.411
which is not
an uncommon reaction
in Jersey.

36:04.538 --> 36:08.624
So, the whole thing
with my manager...

36:09.209 --> 36:12.294
Oops. No, no EPO.

36:12.546 --> 36:15.130
This has nothing to do
with anything you did.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.633
- Let her know she's in the clear.
- I could.

36:18.426 --> 36:21.679
Or 10% of a Nike contract

36:21.805 --> 36:23.639
is a hell of a lot of cash.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.810
You don't need your thymus.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.728
If we take it out,
everything else is manageable.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.438
Manageable?
I thought you just cured me.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.108
Uh-uh.
This is just diagnostic.

36:34.234 --> 36:37.653
Tensilon erases
the symptoms of MG
for five or six minutes.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.664
Sometimes less.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.585
This is exactly
why I created nurses.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.545
Clean up on Aisle Three!

37:05.974 --> 37:08.225
If you've come
to search my office,
you should wait 10 minutes.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.560
I'll be out of your hair.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.897
Here, start with my purse.
Just save me some mints.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.358
What do you wanna know?
My sex life with Mark?

37:16.484 --> 37:18.569
My guilt over
crippling your damn leg?

37:18.695 --> 37:21.322
Or are you just here to gloat
because you weren't the leak?

37:21.656 --> 37:23.115
I want to apologize.

37:28.622 --> 37:29.622
Maybe I've

37:31.625 --> 37:33.834
been punishing you
for a little too long.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.172
And maybe you've been
punishing me.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.843
If we're going to
work together,
I need to know.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.515
Do you hate me
or do you love me?

37:51.061 --> 37:52.728
Either way, I think
we've got a problem.

37:56.066 --> 37:59.151
I hate you and I love you.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.864
And I love Mark.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.369
And you don't hate him.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.578
No.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.708
So what do we do?

38:14.834 --> 38:17.044
We deal with each other.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.547
Right.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.467
That plan's been
working great so far.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.513
It'll get better.
It'll get easier.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.682
- Why?
- I don't know.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.517
That's what my therapist
tells me.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.206
In the
professional cycling world,
we are subject to

38:54.332 --> 38:57.459
what seems like
constant witch-hunts
and finger-pointing.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.839
But I want to thank Dr. House
and the excellent medical team

39:01.965 --> 39:03.632
here at Princeton-Plainsboro.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.635
My hope is that this diagnosis

39:06.761 --> 39:08.429
will put to rest any rumors
that I would ever...

39:08.555 --> 39:10.472
He needs blood transfusions
every two weeks,

39:10.598 --> 39:12.474
which means
he can dope all he wants.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.727
He's got a doctor's pass.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.062
It's medicinal.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.982
He got away with it.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.608
Mmm-hmm.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.361
He cheated and won a game.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.742
Life's more complicated than
who gets to the finish line
first.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.915
I fell in love
with my husband's best friend.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.380
Near the end,
I was at the hospital
every day,

39:45.133 --> 39:47.676
and Joe would come by
after work.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.638
We'd go for walks
and try to talk each other
through it.

39:53.475 --> 39:54.892
We kind of clung on
to each other.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.565
My wife

40:03.610 --> 40:06.528
wasn't dying.
She wasn't even sick.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.489
Everything was fine.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.033
But I met someone who

40:13.870 --> 40:16.580
made me feel funny.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.126
Good.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.713
And I didn't want to
let that feeling go.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.472
What happened to you?

40:34.933 --> 40:37.726
How can anyone
go through that alone?

40:38.561 --> 40:39.978
You can't control
your emotions.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.188
No.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.069
Just your actions.

40:53.535 --> 40:56.370
You didn't do it, did you?
You didn't sleep with him.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.082
I couldn't have
lived with myself.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.050
You'd be surprised
what you can live with.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.401
Hey.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.363
I need you to open a door.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.573
It's not allowed.

41:33.575 --> 41:36.410
Yeah,
I was having therapy
in here today

41:36.953 --> 41:38.078
and I left my cane.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.413
Sorry.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.000
Dude,

41:44.335 --> 41:45.627
I'm crippled.
