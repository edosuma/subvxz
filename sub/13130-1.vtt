03:49.940 --> 03:51.100
Hello.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.220
Breathing pretty heavy
over there.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.300
Just a dream.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.980
You sure you're okay?

04:28.820 --> 04:31.060
Do you want me to leave
or something?

04:34.380 --> 04:37.260
No, stay.
I'm gonna go get some air.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.780
You know you got two
different shoes on, right?

05:57.780 --> 05:59.780
One's a little newer
than the other.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.100
Anything else?

06:04.940 --> 06:06.740
Thanks for stopping by.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.980
What the hell
did you just do?

06:45.300 --> 06:47.180
How did you get up there?

07:13.780 --> 07:16.780
Be strong, fellows.
We going, baby. Come on.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.700
One of us has to move on
some of that. Oh, yeah?

07:23.380 --> 07:25.740
Well, some of us already have.
Hi, Dory.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.420
Hey, Tommy. Hey, Dan!

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500
Looking good,
all right.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.620
Thanks, Trev.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.100
Referring to the endless array
of women, dickhead.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.700
How can they all be in love
with me? Exactly, how can they?

07:37.780 --> 07:39.620
Incoming, gentlemen.

07:40.380 --> 07:43.300
Oh, my sweet mama and papa.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.380
See that smile she gave us?
Yeah. Looked like a toothpaste ad.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.260
Whitest teeth
I've ever come across.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.020
Faster, faster!
Punch hard, punch hard.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.740
Heel! Good!
All right, Jensen.

07:54.820 --> 07:57.740
You work hard and you get
results. That's how it happens.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.100
Nice, Kyle.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.620
Excellent.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.860
Now, who else has some good
stuff to show me today, huh?

08:15.180 --> 08:17.940
All right, Millman. Nice.

08:18.020 --> 08:21.300
Tight. Lower your shoulders.
Good. Keep it tight.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.260
Good, good.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.260
I want to show you something, Coach.
Don't waste energy. Keep that mouth shut.

08:30.980 --> 08:32.340
Good.

08:34.220 --> 08:35.940
Millman. Millman!

08:48.220 --> 08:49.620
Sorry, Coach.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.220
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.460
I can do this.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.820
I've been working on it.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.980
Get over here!

09:02.380 --> 09:05.700
Nobody on this planet can do
what you are trying to do.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.700
You are great up there, Danny.
You're one of the best I've seen.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.740
You're gonna rank even higher
than you did last year,

09:15.820 --> 09:18.860
and you might make it
through all the qualifiers if

09:18.900 --> 09:20.820
you don't
kill yourself first.

09:24.540 --> 09:25.980
Tommy, you're up.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.540
What's he trying to do?

09:31.620 --> 09:34.180
Three consecutive flips
before he dismounts.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.980
Anybody ever done that?
Nope.

09:39.180 --> 09:40.980
That's why
he's trying to do it.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.380
Thinks it's gonna make him
lord of the rings.

09:43.420 --> 09:46.980
Only, with Middleman, it's where he tries
to tear both arms out of their sockets.

09:47.060 --> 09:50.780
All right, the next qualifying
heat is six weeks from today,

09:50.860 --> 09:52.500
and you know what I say.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.060
Don't think
this is gonna happen

09:54.140 --> 09:57.420
just 'cause you're pretty
and can do a handstand.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.660
You think I'm kidding?

09:59.700 --> 10:03.300
And I've got footage of your
competition you need to see again.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.300
Help you with something?

10:48.020 --> 10:50.180
You can tell me
how you did it.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.780
You like things explained.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.580
Don't you?

11:07.380 --> 11:09.060
How we doing tonight?

11:11.260 --> 11:12.740
Look.

11:12.820 --> 11:16.380
That roof's gotta be at
least 10, maybe 12 feet high.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.900
No human can make a vertical
leap over four or five feet, tops.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.580
I know. I'm a gymnast.

11:24.580 --> 11:28.540
Toughest men's sport in the
world. Most people don't know that.

11:28.620 --> 11:32.300
The Spartans of ancient Greece
were gymnasts, too.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.380
They vaulted over bulls.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.900
Trained their elite warriors
that way.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.580
Did you know that?

11:39.980 --> 11:43.700
I know more than you think. And
you think more than you know.

11:44.180 --> 11:46.220
But knowledge is
not the same as wisdom.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.340
Yeah? What's the difference?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.980
You know how to clean a
windshield, right? Yeah.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.740
Wisdom is doing it.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.500
I train seven days a week,
50 weeks out of the year.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.300
Why so much?
Are you serious?

12:08.180 --> 12:10.340
I am a heartbeat away
from qualifying.

12:10.420 --> 12:11.980
Qualifying for what?

12:14.260 --> 12:16.300
You watch the Olympics?
No.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.820
Thanks for stopping by.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.660
Look, even as good as I am,

12:25.580 --> 12:28.940
I gotta do everything I can
to make sure that I qualify.

12:29.460 --> 12:33.580
There's a lot you'd have to know before
you could understand what you saw.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.060
Go. Ask me.
Ask me something.

12:39.180 --> 12:40.700
Ask me anything.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.620
Are you happy?

12:48.900 --> 12:51.220
You said
I could ask you anything.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.420
What does happy
have to do with anything?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.780
Everything.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.740
My dad's got plenty of cash,

12:58.580 --> 13:01.100
school's kind of a breeze,
I get straight A's.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.860
I got great friends,
I'm in great shape,

13:03.940 --> 13:06.860
and I only sleep alone
when I absolutely want to.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.060
So why can't you
sleep at night?

13:11.140 --> 13:14.300
Yesterday, you came here
at 3:00 a. m. Now, tonight.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.580
That's two nights in a row.

13:16.660 --> 13:19.660
What are you? Some kind of a Quickie
Mart philosopher or something like that?

13:19.700 --> 13:20.820
You need some philosophy?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.700
No, thanks, Socrates.
I get enough at school.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.700
Last question.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.780
If you don't make the Olympic
team, what will you do?

13:34.900 --> 13:36.460
If I don't what?

13:36.500 --> 13:38.140
You must have thought
about it.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.860
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:39.940 --> 13:41.620
What's the problem?

13:44.540 --> 13:46.900
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.540
You're a freak. And I don't
need you freaking me out.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.780
Thirteen.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.460
Fourteen.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.780
Your exit sign's lit, Middleman.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.300
Fifteen.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.620
Sixteen.

14:15.700 --> 14:19.180
Hey, there, beautiful thing.
So, this is what you do for fun.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.220
Seventeen.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.900
Eighteen.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.260
Did I pick up that maybe you and
Dory hooked up the other night?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.060
Come on, Dan-o.
It's all you.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.860
Nineteen.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.420
She told you that?
Is it true?

14:45.540 --> 14:47.660
We're supposed to be friends,
man.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.100
What does
that mean, exactly?

14:53.140 --> 14:56.460
It means you're a jerk who
treats his friends like dirt.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.220
Somebody grab my beers.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.660
Somebody grab mine!

15:08.820 --> 15:10.260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:12.660 --> 15:13.820
Come on, guys.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.780
Hey, Dan, what's the matter
with you, man?

15:15.860 --> 15:18.940
With friends like you, who
needs assholes, right, Dan-o?

15:19.020 --> 15:21.020
Calm down. What? You
want to fight Tommy?

15:21.100 --> 15:24.620
Who does he think he is? He's
pissed at you, all right? Is it true?

15:24.660 --> 15:27.340
I thought Dory was old news.
All right?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.340
So, excuse me if she
comes banging on my door.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.380
Why? Why, Dan?

15:31.460 --> 15:33.420
Listen to yourself.
Dory was Tommy's girl.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.980
I said I thought it was over!

15:36.020 --> 15:38.500
Just go back
to your party, man.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.620
Okay. Yeah, I will.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.140
Hey.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.140
You want these?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.820
You're really cute.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.740
Jesus!

16:41.580 --> 16:43.180
Susie, you okay?

16:45.940 --> 16:47.180
Yeah.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.340
Sorry.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.859
What's the matter?

17:16.940 --> 17:18.540
Couldn't sleep again?

17:29.900 --> 17:31.020
What would you say
if I told you

17:31.100 --> 17:33.860
that I keep seeing those shoes
in a dream I keep having?

17:33.940 --> 17:36.100
I'd say maybe
you're still asleep.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.700
You can live a whole lifetime
without ever being awake.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.180
Hey, Socrates.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.420
If you know so much,

17:51.540 --> 17:53.940
how come you're working
at a gas station?

17:53.980 --> 17:57.580
This is a service station.
We offer service.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.540
There's no higher purpose.

18:01.420 --> 18:04.340
Than pumping gas?
Service to others.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.500
How we doing tonight?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.620
Japanese style, huh?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.420
So you know Socrates?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.660
Is that what you call him?

18:55.700 --> 18:58.100
I bet he loves that.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.220
You eat here with him
every night?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.460
Actually,
I think one's for you.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.700
I see you've met Joy.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.900
Hey, big Buddha.
Hi, little Buddha.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.460
Joy, this is Dan.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.860
We met.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.820
Socrates.
Socrates.

19:18.380 --> 19:19.700
Bon appétit.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.260
You look hungry.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.820
Joy do all that?

19:49.540 --> 19:51.260
She live around here?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.580
She related to you
or something?

19:55.660 --> 19:58.380
You need to start asking
better questions.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.500
What?

20:11.580 --> 20:14.100
Slow down.
You might taste something.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.700
You sure got a lot of rules
about stuff, don't you?

20:20.780 --> 20:24.780
Not rules. Things I've learned
from my own life experience.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.380
That's why I'd say
your eating is sloppy.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.540
Who cares?
You do.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.500
That's the difference
between us, Dan.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.700
You practice gymnastics.
I practice everything.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.340
If I was your trainer,
no meat.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.620
Seriously?
None.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.500
I could probably
handle that.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.460
No TV, no alcohol,
no drugs and no sex.

20:52.540 --> 20:55.580
And that's why I'm glad
you're not my trainer.

20:55.660 --> 20:59.660
So, this diet and your training
are making you all you can be?

21:00.420 --> 21:02.260
Absolutely.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.900
So, how long
can you stand like this?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.100
Name it.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.500
Five minutes. On the table.
Done.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.220
You move so much as a muscle,

21:20.300 --> 21:22.700
and I get to call you Jack
for the rest of the night.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.940
Jack?
Short for jackass.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.420
What time is it?

22:15.220 --> 22:16.980
What time is it?

22:22.380 --> 22:24.060
What time

22:24.140 --> 22:25.420
is

22:25.460 --> 22:26.740
it?

22:30.260 --> 22:31.500
What

22:31.540 --> 22:33.180
time

22:33.260 --> 22:34.180
is...

22:38.780 --> 22:40.380
My son, Jack.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.420
Thanks for stopping by.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.420
Everyone tells you what to do
and what's good for you.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.860
They don't want you
to find your own answers.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.100
They want you
to believe theirs.

23:01.620 --> 23:04.340
And let me guess.
You want me to believe yours.

23:04.420 --> 23:05.780
No.

23:05.860 --> 23:09.580
I want you to stop gathering
information from outside yourself

23:09.620 --> 23:12.260
and start gathering it
from the inside.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.300
What are you, part of
some cult or something?

23:16.380 --> 23:19.180
People are afraid
of what's inside,

23:19.220 --> 23:22.620
and that's the only place they're
ever gonna find what they need.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.060
Why can't you sleep?

23:26.100 --> 23:29.100
Is it because,
maybe, late at night,

23:29.180 --> 23:32.300
when all the noise dies down and
you're lying there in the bed,

23:32.380 --> 23:36.340
and there's nobody around but you,
then, maybe, you get a little scared?

23:39.500 --> 23:42.340
Scared because suddenly
everything feels so

23:44.060 --> 23:45.460
empty.

23:49.860 --> 23:54.300
You tell me you want to be more than
just someone who gets up on those rings

23:54.380 --> 23:57.420
and performs
a well-practiced stunt or two.

23:59.620 --> 24:02.300
You tell me
you want to be someone

24:02.380 --> 24:05.580
who uses his mind and his body

24:05.660 --> 24:09.300
in ways that most people would
never have the courage to,

24:11.300 --> 24:13.540
and I will train you, Dan,

24:15.060 --> 24:17.020
to be a real warrior.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.700
Is he all right?

24:56.660 --> 24:58.340
What's going on?

24:58.420 --> 25:00.580
Kyle. He took a bad fall.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.420
It's fine. I'm fine.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.180
It might be broken.
No.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.700
We'll need an x-ray.
No.

25:08.780 --> 25:10.980
It's all right, Kyle. It's
all right. It's all right.

25:11.060 --> 25:12.780
I mean it, Coach.
I know.

25:12.860 --> 25:13.940
It doesn't feel like a break.

25:14.020 --> 25:15.660
They're just gonna have
a look at it, that's all.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.460
I don't need it looked at.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.380
And I said you did.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.260
Let's go.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.940
Put it in a sling.
I don't need a sling.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.100
Rider down, man.
Bad break.

25:38.180 --> 25:41.300
You don't know that.
It could be a sprain.

25:41.380 --> 25:45.220
I mean, he's a casualty,
Tommy-boy. He's our best horse man.

25:46.260 --> 25:48.300
Where do you think
that leaves us, huh?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.620
Trevor, get off that thing.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.420
Or what?
Like you don't want it?

25:51.500 --> 25:53.580
Except you suck
at the pommel horse, Middleman.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.300
I just never focused on it.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.100
That's 'cause you got
one big show and only one.

25:59.180 --> 26:00.580
Lord of the rings.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.220
Yeah? Want to see
what I can do?

26:02.260 --> 26:03.980
Don't embarrass yourself.
Go play, little boy.

26:04.020 --> 26:07.220
Jesus Christ, did you both
just see them take Kyle away?

26:11.060 --> 26:13.420
I mean, Jesus,
what if he's done?

26:13.500 --> 26:17.700
Don't get in my face about it, all right?
Jesus, go hold his hand if you want to.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.740
Sometimes,
I don't like myself very much.

26:36.340 --> 26:40.140
My first thought was about how maybe
Kyle's fall could work out for me.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.100
People are not their thoughts.

26:45.140 --> 26:49.060
They think they are and it
brings them all kinds of sadness.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.380
Toss me that wrench.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.540
I'm not what I think?

26:57.060 --> 26:58.460
Of course not.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.860
The five-eighths.

27:18.740 --> 27:20.780
The mind is just
a reflex organ.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.220
It reacts to everything.

27:23.300 --> 27:27.140
Fills your head with millions
of random thoughts a day.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.620
None of those thoughts
reveal any more about you

27:29.700 --> 27:33.420
than a freckle does
at the end of your nose.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.900
Take a swing at me.
What?

27:46.420 --> 27:47.700
What are you doing?

27:47.780 --> 27:50.700
Come on. 10 bucks if you
can slap me on the cheek.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.620
Come on. Take a shot.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.380
Knock it off, man.
I don't want to hit you.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.060
You don't want to hit me?

28:05.820 --> 28:07.740
I don't want to hurt you.

28:08.860 --> 28:11.780
I guess I'll just have to
keep slapping you then.

28:21.220 --> 28:24.820
Did you notice how the right
leverage can be very effective?

28:32.900 --> 28:34.860
What if I were to tell you

28:36.340 --> 28:39.700
that's what your training,
even your life, is about?

28:40.940 --> 28:44.460
Developing the wisdom
to apply the right leverage

28:44.540 --> 28:47.060
in the right place,
at the right time.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.700
Take out the trash.
You take out the trash.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.220
The trash is up here.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.860
That's the first part
of your training,

28:56.940 --> 29:00.140
learning to throw out everything
you don't need in here.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.340
How?

29:08.140 --> 29:11.300
Meet me tomorrow on campus.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.100
Strawberry Creek bridge.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.580
Where the hell are you going?
Poli-sci. Where are you going?

29:17.660 --> 29:20.460
I'm going to pommel horse
try-outs.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
I forgot.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.140
Less than an hour.
Hey, hey! Wait up.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.820
Tell them to hold up
for me, all right? What?

29:35.380 --> 29:36.460
Soc!

29:38.820 --> 29:39.860
Soc!

29:42.620 --> 29:46.020
Listen.
I totally forgot about this.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.860
Now, I got this thing
at the gym.

29:47.940 --> 29:50.700
It's pretty important.
Can we make this quick?

29:51.700 --> 29:52.780
Sure.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.620
Hey!

30:08.860 --> 30:11.740
Hey! I'm talking to you.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.620
What the hell is wrong with you?
You said you were in a hurry.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.860
So you pushed me off the
bridge? I emptied your mind.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.180
You what?
I emptied...

30:20.260 --> 30:22.500
No, you didn't.
You threw me into the river.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.900
And while you were falling, tell
me, Dan, what were you thinking of?

30:24.980 --> 30:25.980
I don't know!

30:26.060 --> 30:27.380
Were you thinking about school? No!

30:27.460 --> 30:28.620
Grocery shopping?
No!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.940
This thing you had to
hurry off to? No! I was...

30:31.020 --> 30:32.260
The present.

30:32.340 --> 30:35.140
Devoted 100% to the experience
you were having.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.780
You even had a word for it.

30:40.180 --> 30:42.700
You're out of your mind.
You know that?

30:43.140 --> 30:45.500
It's taken
a lifetime of practice.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.580
We want you
out of your mind, too, Dan.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.820
What is that you do?

31:00.900 --> 31:03.060
Some kind of
martial arts move?

31:03.980 --> 31:07.820
I didn't see it coming.
You weren't paying attention.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.780
Even now you're not.
Your mind's filling up again.

31:11.860 --> 31:14.660
You're missing out
on everything that's going on.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.660
There's nothing going on.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.420
There's never
nothing going on.

32:11.540 --> 32:13.460
Take out the trash, Dan.

32:14.420 --> 32:18.700
The trash is anything that is keeping
you from the only thing that matters,

32:19.620 --> 32:20.940
this moment.

32:21.620 --> 32:22.700
Here.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.300
Now.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.460
And when you truly are
in the here and now,

32:32.500 --> 32:36.820
you'll be amazed at what you can
do and how well you can do it.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.380
Until we know more about Kyle,
we need the horse covered, so...

32:46.460 --> 32:49.300
Anybody who wants
a shot at it, gets a shot.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.740
Where's Millman?

33:48.420 --> 33:51.060
All right,
next man up. Trev?

33:51.140 --> 33:53.980
You know I'm superstitious,
Coach. I gotta go last.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.340
I'll go.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.780
All right.

35:42.860 --> 35:46.860
Millman, where the hell
did that come from?

36:01.660 --> 36:02.700
Soc!

36:02.740 --> 36:06.540
Hot damn! I wish you could've
been there. You would've loved it!

36:07.260 --> 36:08.940
I used your trick.

36:09.020 --> 36:12.820
I used your mind trick and it worked.
It totally worked. I was awesome.

36:14.700 --> 36:19.260
It's not a trick. Yeah, well,
whatever it is, I used it.

36:19.980 --> 36:22.460
I took out the trash,
and I mean Trev?

36:22.540 --> 36:24.780
Trev's the one guy
I'm always going up against.

36:24.820 --> 36:27.700
You should have seen me.
I demolished the guy.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.460
You know, I wasn't worried
about what did happen,

36:32.500 --> 36:34.420
or what might happen,
what could happen.

36:34.460 --> 36:38.140
I just got up there
and I cleared my mind.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.660
And I was flawless.

36:46.380 --> 36:49.700
Listen, I'm jumping in
with both feet. All right?

36:49.780 --> 36:54.660
Whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.
No beer, no meat, no girls, no problem.

36:54.740 --> 36:58.020
How long did you stay
that way, clear and flawless?

36:59.340 --> 37:02.260
"I demolished that guy.
You should have seen me. "

37:05.060 --> 37:06.700
You're in the past.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.060
Gloating.

37:10.900 --> 37:13.020
You're not in the now, living.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.100
You haven't learned anything.

37:20.020 --> 37:23.260
Go home.
Training's over for tonight.

37:26.220 --> 37:27.620
Wait a minute.

37:34.580 --> 37:35.980
Wait a minute.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.140
Go home, I said.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.500
Hey, Dan.

39:54.980 --> 39:58.340
Why do we have to be all the way up
here, where we could kill ourselves?

39:58.420 --> 40:00.300
I was hoping
you could tell me.

40:01.460 --> 40:02.580
God!

40:02.660 --> 40:04.460
What do I keep trying for?

40:06.620 --> 40:08.540
I'll never make this cut.

40:11.460 --> 40:13.260
Dad was right.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.780
I'm gonna make him right if
I don't find a way to do this.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.100
Will I ever forgive myself
if I don't make this cut?

40:21.180 --> 40:22.780
Where the hell is Millman?

40:22.860 --> 40:25.740
Too good to show up
for practice, now, I guess.

40:25.820 --> 40:29.060
I don't know how to handle these
kids. What do I say to them?

40:29.140 --> 40:32.340
They're talking,
but their lips aren't moving.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.860
I'm not their mother.
I'm their coach.

40:36.940 --> 40:38.980
Coach thinks
I'm worthless.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.020
I am worthless.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.460
I'm a worthless piece of shit

40:44.500 --> 40:46.900
and Millman's always
gonna be better than me.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.820
Am I reading their minds?

40:48.900 --> 40:52.460
Maybe you just never really
listened to them before.

40:52.500 --> 40:56.100
I've only got four qualifiers
left. I've got to get new mats.

40:56.180 --> 40:59.060
I can't stick this double double.
My line's not straight on the bar.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.500
I'm such a worthless
piece of shit.

41:05.260 --> 41:08.980
You gotta be doing this.
Otherwise I'm losing my mind.

41:09.060 --> 41:13.260
Sometimes you have to lose your
mind before you come to your senses.

41:14.580 --> 41:15.860
Millman!

41:18.220 --> 41:20.140
It's about time you showed up.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.060
Thanks for joining us.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.700
Go home, I said.

42:25.340 --> 42:27.340
What did you just do to me?

42:32.180 --> 42:35.300
You have to be strong
if you're gonna do this, Dan.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.020
What did you do?

42:38.100 --> 42:41.820
Where I'm gonna take you, some
of the things I'm gonna show you,

42:43.300 --> 42:45.300
you're gonna need strength.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.940
And you're gonna need
to trust me.

42:58.340 --> 43:00.300
So it's hot as hell,
and this penguin,

43:00.380 --> 43:03.380
he's pushing his broken-down
car past the 31 flavors.

43:03.460 --> 43:06.060
So, suddenly he's practically
burying his face in a large vanilla

43:06.140 --> 43:07.780
when he sees
a service station.

43:07.860 --> 43:10.540
So he goes over, the mechanic
opens up the hood and says,

43:10.580 --> 43:13.540
"Looks to me
like you've blown a seal. "

43:13.620 --> 43:17.460
The penguin wipes his mouth and says,
"Hey, screw you! It's ice cream. "

43:22.420 --> 43:24.660
What's up, Tommy?
Hey, Trev.

43:25.940 --> 43:28.580
Hey, what's up with
the rabbit chow, Middleman?

43:34.500 --> 43:36.140
All right, I got another one.

43:36.220 --> 43:40.020
A man, a duck and a big-breasted
nun walk into a bar, right?

43:40.100 --> 43:42.460
So, this old guy
did this high jump.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.420
Did this really high jump.

43:48.380 --> 43:49.580
And?

43:51.700 --> 43:54.060
I'm kind of doing
what he tells me

43:55.060 --> 43:57.260
so I can find out
how he did it.

43:57.340 --> 43:58.500
Wait a minute.

43:58.580 --> 44:01.260
You're letting somebody
else coach you? No.

44:02.260 --> 44:05.420
Well, what's he doing to you?
'Cause you look like crap.

44:05.460 --> 44:06.780
I don't know.

44:09.460 --> 44:11.860
I don't know
what he's doing to me.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.700
You better get away from it,
Middleman.

44:21.780 --> 44:26.020
We got qualifiers in four weeks and you're
looking like a worthless piece of shit.

44:39.860 --> 44:40.900
Hey!

44:42.420 --> 44:43.940
Joy, right?
Mmm-hmm.

44:44.780 --> 44:47.300
I need to talk to you
about our mutual friend.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.180
Socrates?

44:50.500 --> 44:53.620
If he didn't tell you his
name, you won't get it from me.

44:53.700 --> 44:56.060
Yeah, why didn't he tell me?

44:56.140 --> 44:58.540
I mean, I don't know anything
about the guy.

45:00.260 --> 45:01.860
I'm serious.

45:01.940 --> 45:05.380
All right? He's supposed to be making
me stronger, making my life better.

45:05.460 --> 45:07.020
It's just the opposite.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.940
What's he doing?

45:10.620 --> 45:12.580
What are you worried about?

45:13.140 --> 45:15.820
I want to know
who I'm dealing with here.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.900
Come on, come on.
Tight. Keep it tight, Danny!

46:25.940 --> 46:28.500
No! No, you're shaking!
You're shaking!

46:29.940 --> 46:32.460
What the hell
are you doing up there?

46:34.580 --> 46:37.580
Yeah, I'm off today.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.020
Oh. You're off, huh?

46:39.100 --> 46:41.340
Well, you've been off for
one hell of a streak, Millman.

46:41.420 --> 46:44.580
First you're a dream on the horse and
now you can barely stand up straight.

46:44.660 --> 46:45.700
Huh?

46:46.820 --> 46:50.780
Next time you're tired, go take a
nap instead of coming to practice.

46:58.540 --> 47:00.460
Ike, your key?
Yep, all right.

47:10.340 --> 47:11.500
Voyeur.

47:12.180 --> 47:13.820
How we doing tonight?

47:13.900 --> 47:15.340
How am I doing?

47:16.100 --> 47:18.860
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and I'm horny.

47:18.940 --> 47:20.540
How are you doing?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.340
I need some answers tonight.

47:27.060 --> 47:28.780
I need to know that this...

47:28.820 --> 47:32.940
That this is all going somewhere,
and I need to know it right now.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.980
I mean, what kind of a warrior trains
by sitting around scrubbing toilets?

47:37.060 --> 47:39.900
When you become a warrior, you
learn to meditate in every action.

47:39.980 --> 47:42.820
Scrubbing toilets?
Letting go of attachments.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.100
Like your pride.

47:45.140 --> 47:47.660
Giving up your addictions. Yeah,
name one thing I'm addicted to.

47:47.740 --> 47:51.060
Talking.
Especially interrupting.

47:51.140 --> 47:53.540
Knowing everything,
when in fact you know nothing.

47:53.620 --> 47:56.980
You really think that this is going
to expand my awareness of anything?

47:57.060 --> 48:00.140
My game is off! My coach
probably thinks that I'm on drugs,

48:00.220 --> 48:01.700
and I'm thinking...

48:04.020 --> 48:06.900
I just don't have any more
time for you right now.

48:07.860 --> 48:10.220
All you have is right now,
Jack.

48:13.300 --> 48:15.420
Did you just call me
a jackass again?

48:17.060 --> 48:20.100
'Cause, you know, I'm really starting
to wonder how someone with the life

48:20.180 --> 48:23.340
that you've managed to put
together can teach me anything.

48:24.300 --> 48:26.380
I mean, are you really happy?

48:27.380 --> 48:30.340
Maybe you're just a case of someone
who, not having made much of themselves,

48:30.420 --> 48:33.300
says that the world is lost and
all these things don't matter.

48:33.380 --> 48:36.980
Be happy with less, right? Less
than what? Less than nothing?

48:37.060 --> 48:40.300
I call you a jackass
when you act like a jackass.

48:40.380 --> 48:43.260
Like now, Dan, when you're
letting your emotions control you.

48:43.340 --> 48:46.060
This isn't emotion!
This is common sense!

48:48.100 --> 48:51.220
You know what?
Let me tell you something,

48:51.300 --> 48:53.420
whatever your name really is.

48:55.180 --> 48:58.020
When I get what I want,
I'll be happy.

48:59.340 --> 49:03.020
For real and forever and
anything else I say it'll be.

49:04.460 --> 49:06.140
'Cause I will make it happen.

49:35.940 --> 49:38.900
Three, two, one!

49:46.420 --> 49:48.820
Drink! Drink! Drink!

49:49.780 --> 49:51.260
Danny, good.

49:52.020 --> 49:53.340
That's it, Danny.

49:53.420 --> 49:54.540
Steady.

49:56.020 --> 49:59.220
Good. All right, come on!
Bring it home!

50:07.020 --> 50:10.060
That's what I remember about
you, Millman! You were good.

50:17.660 --> 50:19.100
I needed this.

50:19.580 --> 50:21.180
Needed to escape.

50:22.180 --> 50:25.620
Lucky me.
Yeah, and lucky me.

50:25.700 --> 50:28.100
You guys
are in such great shape.

50:28.860 --> 50:31.260
So if I wasn't
in such great shape,

50:32.140 --> 50:35.220
wasn't on the gymnastics team,
just had a regular body,

50:35.300 --> 50:36.900
you wouldn't be into me?

50:36.980 --> 50:39.820
If I didn't have this body,
would you be into me?

52:38.780 --> 52:40.300
Hey, Middleman.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.580
I don't know what to say.

52:43.660 --> 52:44.900
Hey.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.780
Got the whole team here.

52:47.860 --> 52:51.220
You ran a red light, man.
Can you believe that?

52:51.300 --> 52:52.820
You gotta get better, man,
'cause...

52:52.900 --> 52:53.980
You ran a red light.

52:54.060 --> 52:55.700
...whose ass
am I gonna kick at practice?

52:55.780 --> 52:58.020
Don't waste your energy.
Keep that mouth shut.

52:58.100 --> 52:59.340
Dan?

53:40.180 --> 53:41.220
Dan?

53:42.305 --> 53:48.581
