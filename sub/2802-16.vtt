NARRATOR: <i>Previously on </i>White Collar...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.463
Sarah, why are you helping out?

00:04.546 --> 00:06.256
-I like the mystery.
-Is that all?

00:07.174 --> 00:08.383
(SARAH LAUGHS)

00:09.051 --> 00:10.802
Moz, I know who's behind everything.

00:10.886 --> 00:14.473
PETER: <i>Vincent Adler.</i>
<i>He's rained hell down on both our lives.</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:17.434
I'm trying to reconcile the Adler I knew
with the man responsible...

00:17.518 --> 00:18.519
PETER: <i>...for Kate?</i>

00:19.311 --> 00:20.312
<i>-For Mozzie?</i>
-NEAL: <i>Yeah.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:21.396
<i>So let's get him.</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:23.941
I caught you when I found out
what you wanted most.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.652
-We know what he wants most.
-NEAL: It's a fractal antenna.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.196
And this shape corresponds
to an emergency beacon.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.115
And you're telling me that
if we build a real one of these...

00:32.199 --> 00:33.951
It's gonna lead us to a boat, or a plane,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.994
or something that disappeared
in the 1940s.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.496
Something worth killing two people?

00:37.579 --> 00:38.830
It's worth it to Adler.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:46.672 --> 00:47.881
(PETER WHISTLING)

00:47.965 --> 00:49.091
Uh, hold on a second.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.678
Isn't there a probie
who would benefit more

00:52.761 --> 00:53.971
from lugging evidence around?

00:54.054 --> 00:57.140
Carrying evidence isn't considered
valuable field experience.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.476
-For anyone.
-I'm sure you never complained

00:59.560 --> 01:02.396
when you were hauling
around plasma cutters and borescopes.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.940
When I'm cracking safes,
I have a sense of purpose.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.234
Had. Had a sense of purpose.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.986
Now you have a new purpose.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.613
Lugging these Rolex knockoffs to evidence.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.035
-We're almost there. Careful.
-Thank you.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.249
Sara.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.418
Did you find something interesting?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.336
On your desk? No.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.424
In the ocean, yes. This is big, guys.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.426
Get the team in the conference room.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.760
Can I talk to Neal first?

01:36.138 --> 01:37.181
Thank you.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.057
-I'll meet you up there.
-All right.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.603
-So--
-Yeah...

01:43.770 --> 01:44.771
You look well.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.065
Thank you.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.360
You, too.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.404
-Did you change your hair?
-No.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.364
I like it. It's got this...

01:55.908 --> 01:56.909
Yeah.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.954
All right, look, before everybody else
gets here, I just wanna say

02:01.038 --> 02:02.748
that if we're gonna continue
working together,

02:02.831 --> 02:05.334
then we really should not ignore
the other night.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.254
-Look, it was...
-...hot.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.672
Hot?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.509
-I mean, I thought so, but...
-No, I know.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.428
Stacks with no A/C,
it was like being back in college.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.805
-You didn't go to college.
-I wasn't enrolled,

02:18.889 --> 02:21.683
but I did spend a lot of time researching.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.893
Uh-huh.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.103
Speaking of research, take a look at this.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.151
-Uh-oh. More faux-lex watches?
-Yeah.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.905
JONES: These are the nice ones.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.367
Our fence in Alphabet City is trying
to move a hundred and twenty boxes.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.077
Each box with 35 of these.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.870
At 600 apiece, that's...

02:41.954 --> 02:44.039
That's $2.5-million street value.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.542
Oh, you've been sitting
too close to Caffrey.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.838
When did that happen?

02:50.921 --> 02:52.256
I don't know.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.759
Diana, round up the Harvard crew.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.594
Jones, take this box to evidence.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.929
Yeah.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.765
(WHISTLING)

03:01.849 --> 03:03.308
Okay, people.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.019
What we have today
is a chance to take down

03:06.103 --> 03:09.565
one of the most notorious
white-collar criminals in New York.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.108
Vincent Adler.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.361
As you know, Adler ran a Ponzi scheme

03:14.444 --> 03:17.447
about a half a decade ago
that rivaled Bernie Madoff's.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.993
When it folded, he disappeared
with a billion dollars.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.452
He's also my former boss.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.499
PETER: Sara Ellis, from Sterling Bosch,
has come up with a fresh lead.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.336
Adler is looking for a sunken
U-boat off the New York coast.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.547
First music boxes, now U-boats.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.925
-Sara?
-This is U-boat 869.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.219
NEAL: It was launched
from Germany in 1945.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.513
-What makes this thing so valuable?
-PETER: We don't know.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.766
Germany sent out a number of U-boats
towards the end of the war.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.476
Their contents were unknown.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.021
Whatever is in this,
one person has been shot,

03:49.104 --> 03:50.939
and at least two people are dead
because of it.

03:51.023 --> 03:55.485
Adler wants this sub.
Which means we can use it to find him.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.113
If he's looking for this thing
off the New York coast,

03:58.197 --> 04:01.533
then he's using boats. H
e's renting sonars and submersibles.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.328
There's a paper trail here.
Let's track him down.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.624
Diana. Jones.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.627
There is another lead I need you to find.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.129
Alex Hunter.
She's an old acquaintance of Neal's.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.341
But you already know that.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.135
We're already familiar with Alex.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.220
How is she involved?

04:21.303 --> 04:24.181
There's a lot she may know
about all of this. Find her.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.438
So... Alex.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.024
Okay. Calling her an acquaintance
may be an understatement.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.734
Neal, you don't owe me anything.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.569
I've lived a life, too.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.738
But if there is anything between us...

04:40.948 --> 04:41.949
...don't lie to me.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.617
-I would never.
-Yes, you would.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.161
So Alex?

04:46.245 --> 04:49.289
Over. A long time ago.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.124
-Was that so hard?
-No.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.709
-Lunch tomorrow?
-My place?

04:52.793 --> 04:53.794
See you at 1:00.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.888
MOZZIE: <i>A sunken U-boat?</i>

05:04.972 --> 05:07.766
-What could be better than this?
-What do you think is in it?

05:07.850 --> 05:11.019
Ah. That is the question, isn't it?

05:11.854 --> 05:13.939
Plutonium would be an educated guess.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.066
You know they had the bomb
years before we did.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.360
Guess I missed that chapter
in world history.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.820
MOZZIE: Yeah, of course you did.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.406
It could also contain Hitler clones.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.867
-Is he serious?
-Unfortunately, yes.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.911
-Mozzie, the antenna.
-Hold on. It's gotta warm up.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.371
Another possibility...

05:29.454 --> 05:30.914
Let it be a surprise.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.170
The Chrysler Building. That's new.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.296
NEAL: Almost finished.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.173
Painting it for your girlfriend?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.424
Are you nine?

05:41.216 --> 05:43.385
I'm keeping up my technique.
It calms the nerves.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.137
You must paint a lot, then.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.889
I've filled a whole storage room.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.557
Ah-ah-ah!

05:50.017 --> 05:51.059
No.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.438
How close do we have to be
for this thing to work?

05:54.521 --> 05:58.942
Oh, the SOS signal on the U-boat
was designed to go into a passive mode,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.361
which means we'd have to be
right on top of it

06:01.445 --> 06:02.446
in order to detect it.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.739
I don't relish hauling you

06:03.822 --> 06:05.991
and this thing up and down
the Eastern seaboard.

06:06.074 --> 06:10.204
If Alex knows as much
as we think she does about this thing,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.539
could she help us narrow down
our search area?

06:12.623 --> 06:13.874
Well, it's worth a shot.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.877
I haven't gotten through on her number,
but I'll try again.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.047
(DIAL TONE)

06:23.300 --> 06:24.843
-Alex?
-ADLER: <i>Hello, Neal.</i>

06:25.344 --> 06:26.428
Adler.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.931
<i>After all this time,</i>
<i>you recognized my voice.</i>

06:29.014 --> 06:30.390
I'm flattered.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.975
NEAL: <i>Where's Alex?</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:33.894
The lady doesn't wanna be disturbed.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.187
I know about the U-boat.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.231
I'd be disappointed if you didn't.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.275
Call off your dog. Let it go.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.027
NEAL: Can't do that.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.947
After all you've lost.
First Kate, now Alex.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.615
Why keep doing this to yourself?

06:46.698 --> 06:48.158
I'm not gonna stop, Vincent.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.576
Neither am I.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.222
Any chance Alex and Adler
are working together?

07:10.305 --> 07:11.932
No. She would never work with him.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.894
We can't make any definitive statement
about their relationship at this point.

07:16.395 --> 07:20.107
We find Alex Hunter,
we find Vincent Adler. Diana.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.067
DIANA: I ran her aliases by Interpol.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.111
-Checking the local fences.
-Neal?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.445
Already on it.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.366
All right, did you find anything on Alex?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.159
She's moved around a lot.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.370
According to Hale,
she was in town two weeks ago

07:33.453 --> 07:37.291
trying to pawn off some more silver,
through Teddy Eames.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.835
What's she doing mixed up with Eames?
He's small time.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.795
Yeah, trying to move up in the world.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.380
Alex isn't known for her altruism.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.925
Oh, look, are you really trying
to understand Alex at this late date?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.969
-I've never understood her.
-Oh, really?

07:49.052 --> 07:51.346
I thought your relationship
made perfect sense.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.016
Mutual respect, convenience.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.268
-Convenience?
-Correct me if I'm wrong.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.562
I wanna talk to Eames.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.319
You positive Alex met with him?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.404
Definitely. Eames was the last person
to see her

08:07.487 --> 08:09.865
before she disappeared.
Might tell us where she was headed.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.659
Ooh. Larceny, possession, robbery.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.329
Got quite a hefty rap sheet.
I can lean on him.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.122
He's not gonna chat up a fed.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.124
What, you're gonna scam info out of him?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.001
Eames likes selling hot merchandise.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.505
Anything from stolen plasma
screens to borrowed jewelry...

08:24.588 --> 08:26.256
Borrowed jewelry, huh?

08:26.340 --> 08:29.259
Now that you mention it,
we do have that box of faux-lexes.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.929
-Look, this better work.
-Relax.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.639
I'm holding five fake Rolexes.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.475
If I get shaken down, I've got
a government stamped bar code

08:36.558 --> 08:37.601
on the back of my neck.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.145
Caffrey. What can I do for you?

08:40.229 --> 08:41.605
I hear you're moving up in the world.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.941
I'd bring this business to Alex

08:44.024 --> 08:46.818
-but I can't find her.
-I'd check the Interpol website.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.738
-Apparently she's all over it.
-Are we gonna do this or what?

08:49.821 --> 08:51.865
-What do you got?
-MOZZIE: High-quality goods.

08:51.949 --> 08:55.786
Micro-etched crystal,
correct second-hand movement.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.247
Last purchaser's credit card slip.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.333
-Hmm. How much?
-Three hundred each.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.501
-Two.
-NEAL: Come on.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.336
You'll flip these for at least six.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.423
All right. If I sell this one today,
I'll buy as many as you got tomorrow.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.467
-Sounds like a square deal.
-PETER: Hey!

09:10.551 --> 09:13.178
-Grab him.
-Oh, nuts.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.514
-Get back here!
-I know a drop when I see one.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.224
You mind emptying your pockets?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.684
You got probable cause?

09:18.767 --> 09:20.769
Yeah, my badge gives me probable cause.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.104
Hands on the table.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.484
What are you doing hassling us?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.361
Shouldn't you be arresting
stockbrokers or something?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.821
I'll arrest who I want.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.829
All right, your turn.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.879
-Happy?
-Yeah.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.882
All right. I want you pack up
and get out of here in five minutes.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.091
You understand?

09:51.550 --> 09:52.551
You?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.098
So I guess I owe you one. Is that right?

09:58.182 --> 10:00.809
I'd say so.
Tell me about the last time you saw Alex.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.773
Hey. Eames said Alex was headed
to the Conservatory Garden

10:06.857 --> 10:07.983
after she met with him.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.277
Jones, check traffic cams for the Garden.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.196
-See if we can spot her.
-You got it.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.491
-Watches?
-Oh.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.578
-Money?
-What money?

10:20.162 --> 10:22.915
-The 300 Eames gave you.
-What 300 Eames gave me?

10:25.709 --> 10:27.961
-Thanks for the help.
-Anytime, Serpico.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.087
Buy Jones lunch.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.172
We'll see.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.141
Security tapes show her arriving
and walking into the garden.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.686
If she came out, it was
on a side not covered by a camera.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.773
-Any idea what she was doing?
-Eames wouldn't say.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.983
It's a good place for a meeting or a drop.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.694
Well, retracing her steps
may tell us something.

10:52.778 --> 10:56.031
You take the left, I'll take the right.
We can meet in the middle.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.344
Neal!

11:21.640 --> 11:22.724
Neal?

11:25.143 --> 11:26.562
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

11:31.024 --> 11:32.150
Who is this?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.528
ADLER: <i>Hello, Agent Burke.</i>
<i>Nice day, isn't it?</i>

11:34.695 --> 11:35.696
Adler.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.406
Where are you?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.366
<i>Holster the gun and get in the car.</i>

11:55.799 --> 11:57.759
ADLER: <i>Hand over your gun, please.</i>

12:03.599 --> 12:05.559
-Nice to meet you, Peter.
-Save it.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.979
And Neal, I can't tell you
how good it is to see you again.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.689
I'd be lying if I said the same.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.025
You killed Kate.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.776
No, Neal. You did.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.696
You changed her.
The Kate I knew would still be alive.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.781
Where is Alex?

12:19.865 --> 12:21.033
You can ask her when you see her.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.076
-What do you want with us?
-I want Neal.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.662
But I'll bring you along
since I can't let you go.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.582
Peter, you've got a key to Neal's anklet.
Give it to him.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.633
Neal, take off your anklet.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.347
A decision.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.726
In those glasses is a combination
of chloral hydrate, ethanol, and iced tea.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.728
It'll put you out
until we get where we're going.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.812
Or?

12:52.147 --> 12:54.858
-Or you can take another route.
-We don't do this.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.443
Have a drink, Neal.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.363
You may wake up to find
all the answers you've been looking for.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.073
We're not playing this game.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.457
Your turn, Agent Burke.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.976
(GROANS)

13:35.899 --> 13:37.025
Alex.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.528
I was looking for you.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.365
-Should I?
-I think it will help.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.868
(GROANS)

13:47.077 --> 13:48.078
Thank you.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.499
Come on.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.750
Come on.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.794
This is part of a plan, right?

13:55.878 --> 13:58.964
You let yourselves get caught,
then the FBI rides to the rescue?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.424
You got the first part right.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.467
NEAL: You have any idea where we are?

14:02.551 --> 14:05.304
It's a warehouse. That's all I know.
They drugged me, too.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.388
(DOOR OPENS)

14:07.723 --> 14:09.975
-Glad you're awake.
-Why are we here?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.519
Better if I show you.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.820
NEAL: My God.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.242
You found it.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.078
Incredible, isn't it?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.502
ADLER: The last days of the war,

14:37.461 --> 14:40.088
this U-boat was supposed
to reach Argentina

14:40.797 --> 14:44.551
but something happened.
The crew had to scuttle it off our coast.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.597
They were gonna retrieve it after the war,
but obviously that never happened.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.765
How do you know this?

14:50.599 --> 14:52.726
Because one of the crewmen survived.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.604
He was my father.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.191
Why do you need me?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.902
ADLER: The crew rigged the interior
with explosives

15:01.985 --> 15:03.320
to prevent enemy access.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.989
I need someone who can open it
without setting the charges off.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.158
Luckily, I already know the best.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.285
That's why you're here, Neal.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.871
-And if I refuse?
-You won't.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.831
Alex will be with me.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.086
You can pretend you're doing it
to protect her and Peter,

15:19.169 --> 15:21.463
but we both know the real reason.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.216
You wanna see what's inside.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.598
I'll need equipment.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.767
Carbide-tipped drill,
fiber optic borescope...

15:33.851 --> 15:35.978
I think you'll find everything you need.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.565
Getting the hatch open is a two-man job.
You gonna help me?

15:40.023 --> 15:43.110
No. I will be behind blast-proof glass.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.028
Agent Burke can help you.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.114
Keep in mind,
you'll be wearing a remote camera.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.532
Don't try and play a hero.

15:51.910 --> 15:52.953
Can you do this?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.543
Neal?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.422
Not Neal.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.717
And you're not a strawberry blond
with a penchant for Voltaire.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.468
I guess we're both disappointed.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.636
Thought you had that up and running.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.054
It is up and running.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.723
I'm trying to boost the reception

16:12.806 --> 16:16.894
because I have yet to receive a signal
or hear from the suit about a boat.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.523
Are you gonna loom there all day?

16:21.607 --> 16:23.942
I'm not looming.
Neal told me to meet him here.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.027
You know...

16:25.861 --> 16:27.696
-...it's not gonna work out.
-What?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.114
Getting involved with a con man.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.075
No, no. I am not involved with anybody.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.703
I get it. We're fascinating creatures.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.038
We live a life of danger.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.290
It's exciting, slightly erotic.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.377
But guys like us, you find yourself
always trying to stay a step ahead.

16:42.461 --> 16:46.590
You relax once, let down your guard,
and it all goes away.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.217
You paint a very tragic picture.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.387
Ah. One person's tragedy
is another person's excitement.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.478
I'm afraid I drank all the Lafite.

16:59.561 --> 17:03.232
Oh, all of it, except for this bottle
you hid behind all the others.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.150
Mm. There might be some hope for you yet.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.276
Mmm-hmm.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.612
Did you say you were meeting Neal here?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.030
Mmm-hmm. At 1:00.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.366
That was, like, half an hour ago.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.951
Oh, sue me, Mozzie. I'm late.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.869
Yeah, Neal's usually not.

17:17.246 --> 17:19.915
-Did you try his cell?
-It went straight to voicemail.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.835
-It's probably nothing.
-Yeah, it's nothing.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.964
-We should call the suit.
-I'm gonna call Peter.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.224
You ever safe-cracked a submarine?

17:37.307 --> 17:39.560
No. But the principle should be the same.

17:47.776 --> 17:50.571
-What do we got?
-Looks like a typewriter.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.738
NEAL: A typewriter?

17:51.822 --> 17:54.157
PETER: Yeah,
but I don't see any explosives.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.742
All right.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.327
Help me get these bolts off.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.754
Is this really a two-man job?

18:07.838 --> 18:09.423
I figured I'd save you from a bullet.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.758
-By putting me in front of a bomb?
-(CHUCKLES)

18:12.217 --> 18:13.510
Stop talking.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.721
If you don't like it, come do it yourself.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.224
That shut him up.

18:21.226 --> 18:22.227
Here we go.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.908
NEAL: <i>It's an Enigma.</i>

18:35.991 --> 18:37.326
PETER: <i>Code-breaking machine.</i>

18:37.409 --> 18:39.828
-Yeah.
-I'm sure it's wired to blow up.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.955
Be careful.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.582
NEAL: Okay.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.547
That would be TNT.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.424
Yeah. A lot of TNT.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.302
DIANA: <i>No answer from Peter or Neal.</i>

18:55.385 --> 18:56.970
This isn't like either of them.

18:57.346 --> 19:00.390
Good thing is your boyfriend
is wearing a tracking anklet.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.017
Will you let it go? He's not my boyfriend.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.311
Strange. Peter took off Neal's anklet.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.687
JONES: Conservatory Garden.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.564
Same place Alex Hunter was last seen.

19:07.648 --> 19:08.649
We'll check it out.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.817
<i>Sarah, you spoke to Neal last,</i>
<i>I want you with us.</i>

19:10.901 --> 19:12.361
Okay. We're still at Neal's,

19:12.444 --> 19:13.570
so you can just pick us up on your way.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.322
Wait. We?

19:17.783 --> 19:20.410
All right, the Enigma uses
a series of pins and rotors

19:20.494 --> 19:21.620
to encode words.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.206
Fifteen billion billion
possible combinations.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.874
Yes. Thank you for that.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.043
-You're good with crosswords.
-Not that good.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.503
You have a favorite color?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.755
Oh, funny.
This is your skill set, not mine.

19:31.839 --> 19:34.550
Beige is usually a neutral or bluff wire.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.759
-Usually?
-I don't know

19:35.843 --> 19:37.553
if they bluffed with wire 60 years ago.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.849
Now, the live one should be
the silver or the black.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.559
El's favorite color is purple.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.893
That doesn't help.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.229
-I think it's the black.
-Okay.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.438
-Or the silver.
-Mmm.

19:48.522 --> 19:49.523
Or both.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.651
All right. If we cut them both,
that would work. Should work.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.071
I'll cut the black, you cut the silver.

19:56.905 --> 19:57.990
Good. Good.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.491
One, two, three, clip.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.826
Okay. Wait, Peter.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.328
In case this doesn't work...

20:03.412 --> 20:05.080
Yeah. Me, too.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.542
All right.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.003
<i>One...</i>

20:11.879 --> 20:13.964
...two, three.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.718
-PETER: <i>What's it doing? </i>
-NEAL: <i>I think it's a timer.</i>

20:17.801 --> 20:19.011
PETER: <i>How much time do we have?</i>

20:19.094 --> 20:20.554
NEAL: <i>I don't know, but it's moving fast.</i>

20:20.637 --> 20:22.014
-How do we stop it?
-I don't know, Peter.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.516
-It's gonna blow.
-ALEX: Oh, my God. Now I get it.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.059
I know what it is.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.728
-What?
-It's a legend.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.229
<i>The Enigma password is a legend.</i>

20:29.313 --> 20:31.315
The story of an ancient king
with a golden touch

20:31.398 --> 20:32.691
that destroyed him.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.234
Midas. Alex, are you sure?

20:34.318 --> 20:37.613
The radio operator
who received the U-boat's final SOS signal

20:37.696 --> 20:38.697
was my grandfather.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.033
You're Gerhardt Vogner's granddaughter.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.618
He told me to remember the story.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.078
-Do it.
-Okay, Midas.

20:45.829 --> 20:50.125
M-I-D-A-S.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.460
(metal clanking)

20:56.882 --> 20:58.967
-That was close.
-We've cut it closer.

20:59.051 --> 21:00.219
I don't think so.

21:01.512 --> 21:02.638
All right.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.142
<i>You got it?</i>

21:15.692 --> 21:17.152
Whoa. Careful.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.279
NEAL: Ah, more TNT. Great.

21:21.490 --> 21:22.699
This better be good.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.379
I should have known you'd be lurking.
Nice gadget, Mr. Wizard.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.589
Yes, it is. If you think I'm getting

21:37.673 --> 21:40.217
into that thing with two feds,
then you're certifiable.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.760
Fine. Then you're not coming.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.556
Remember, I travel delicately.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.099
`DIANA: Perfect.

21:55.274 --> 21:56.358
PETER: Tools.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.621
If I see jars of fetuses
with little black mustaches,

22:09.705 --> 22:11.081
I'm turning around.

22:11.164 --> 22:14.459
NEAL: <i>I don't think this is the one</i>
<i>carrying the Hitler clones.</i>

22:18.463 --> 22:20.007
Here, watch for tripwires.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.510
Yes.

22:26.138 --> 22:27.723
-Give me a hand?
-Yeah.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.445
NEAL: <i>It's a van Dyck.</i>

22:41.945 --> 22:43.530
<i>It's gotta be worth millions.</i>

22:54.082 --> 22:55.125
Look at this.

22:56.335 --> 22:57.920
It's Nazi plunder.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.505
From all over Europe.

23:02.591 --> 23:03.842
(GRUNTS)

23:08.722 --> 23:09.848
Priam's treasure.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.808
Before it turned out
to be Troy's treasure.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.227
Either way, it's here now.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.562
-This has gotta be worth...
-...billions.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.272
Billions of dollars.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.107
This has to be one
of the greatest collections of art

23:19.191 --> 23:20.359
that's ever been found.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.194
How do we get out of here?

23:23.403 --> 23:24.571
Adler, you seeing this?

23:26.031 --> 23:27.074
Yes.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.283
Not anymore.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.501
That bought us some time. You got an idea?

23:37.584 --> 23:41.004
Adler could have only found this sub
if the antenna was still working.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.381
Mozzie's antenna.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.216
Obviously, Adler got his to work.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.676
-I'll check over here.
-All right.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.886
Careful. That nitro is unstable.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.012
NEAL: All right.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.731
PETER: That looks like our fractal.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.069
Bingo.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.492
Germans built things to last.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.120
You think Mozzie can find us?

24:13.203 --> 24:15.956
If we get to the limo,
I can connect it to a power source.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.207
It's a long shot.

24:20.627 --> 24:21.920
Well done, gentlemen.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.636
A treasure for the ages.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.805
I'm glad you lived long enough to see it.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.726
My God, that's a Rembrandt.

24:36.935 --> 24:40.397
We'll take it from here.
You three are going for a ride.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.523
No.

24:41.607 --> 24:42.691
(GRUNTS)

24:43.025 --> 24:44.318
I'm not going back in that limo.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.987
-Alex.
-Go ahead, Vincent. Shoot us.

24:47.988 --> 24:49.198
Okay.

24:49.573 --> 24:51.617
Shoot them. Then get a mop or something.

24:52.743 --> 24:56.413
Hold on. Okay. We'll get in the limo.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.457
There you go. There's a reasonable man.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.584
Get the drinks ready.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.468
I'm not comfortable with this.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.552
-We know.
-We know.

25:10.636 --> 25:11.637
We're not abducting you.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.180
-Can I get out?
-No.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.765
Well, then it feels like an abduction.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.309
Does anyone have anything
for motion sickness?

25:17.392 --> 25:20.270
Hey, hey, hey. I don't know why,
but I do like you.

25:20.354 --> 25:23.607
I don't want them to hurt you,
so just do yourself a favor and shut up.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.194
-Guys.
-She's right. I will hurt you.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.905
All due respect,
I think you should listen to me now.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.114
Really? Why is that?

25:31.198 --> 25:33.075
-I'm getting a signal.
-Is it the sub?

25:33.158 --> 25:34.868
I don't think so because it's moving.

25:34.952 --> 25:36.495
-JONES: Which way?
-East.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.424
-PETER: Everyone all right?
-ALEX: For the moment.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.010
-Where are we?
-NEAL: In a dry dock.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.474
ALEX: What are those guys doing?

26:03.438 --> 26:04.815
I got a pretty good idea.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.068
PETER: Adler is taking the whole
arch-villain thing pretty seriously.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.487
NEAL: He always had a flair
for the theatrical.

26:12.197 --> 26:13.365
Where's the cavalry, Neal?

26:15.909 --> 26:18.620
Moz will be here. I hope.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.622
-Which way?
-Uh, make a left.

26:20.706 --> 26:21.832
No, I... I mean right.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.834
-Okay, you said left.
-This time I mean right.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.378
-I... I think.
-Christ. Left or right?

26:26.461 --> 26:28.547
Uh, diagonal!

26:37.639 --> 26:40.267
We need to find a way
out of these zip ties.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.727
I've got a knife.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.020
Can't say I'm surprised.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.938
The guards searched us.

26:45.022 --> 26:46.440
Not everywhere.

26:47.983 --> 26:49.193
Just like old times.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.491
NEAL: Yup.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.868
Got it.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.127
-Damn.
-Huh.

27:08.587 --> 27:09.838
Get down! Get down!

27:10.464 --> 27:12.132
Get behind me. Go.

27:14.885 --> 27:16.512
-Cover me, all right?
-Yeah.

27:20.349 --> 27:22.559
-FBI, don't move!
-Lower your weapons!

27:22.643 --> 27:24.061
Put your hands on your head!

27:33.237 --> 27:35.989
I don't think we could have
cut it any closer than that.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.630
You saved me again.

27:53.757 --> 27:54.967
ALEX: You saved me.

28:33.547 --> 28:36.300
-Anything?
-PETER: No. Adler's men aren't talking.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.468
It's safe to assume
he knows we've escaped,

28:38.552 --> 28:39.636
and that we're looking for him.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.471
Is he accelerating his escape plan?

28:41.555 --> 28:44.016
No. I overheard him say
he's shipping the art

28:44.099 --> 28:45.184
to Europe by boat.

28:45.267 --> 28:46.810
But he can't until the end of the week.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.687
Good. That gives us some breathing room.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.397
What do you remember about the warehouse?

28:50.480 --> 28:54.693
Wooden beams, prewar architecture,
solid steel roll-up door facing west.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.737
-That would be the loading bay.
-And there was clanging at night.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.113
Some kind of buoy, I think.

28:58.197 --> 28:59.531
Could be a weather buoy.

28:59.615 --> 29:00.657
PETER: Diana, what do you have?

29:00.741 --> 29:01.867
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

29:02.618 --> 29:04.828
DIANA: There are four along
the Brooklyn shoreline

29:04.912 --> 29:06.496
and three near Battery Park.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.081
NEAL: That's a lot of real estate.

29:08.165 --> 29:11.043
Yeah, let's get some building plans,
see if we can narrow it down.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.253
Adler got that sub
out of the water somehow.

29:13.337 --> 29:15.964
Pull satellite. Let's find this thing.

29:16.048 --> 29:17.132
Thank you, everybody.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.969
Right, I'm gonna catch a ride
to the waterfront.

29:21.053 --> 29:23.514
No, you're not. We got good people on it.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.933
You're gonna finish up,
and then get out of here.

29:26.016 --> 29:28.268
I need you rested. That's an order.

29:28.352 --> 29:29.561
You gonna take your own advice?

29:29.645 --> 29:31.396
Yes. I'm gonna go home,

29:31.480 --> 29:34.441
kiss my wife,
and do at least one normal thing today.

29:34.525 --> 29:35.984
Live to fight another day, huh?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.416
Bunch of feds breathing down your neck.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.960
Probably not your idea of fun.

29:53.043 --> 29:56.255
Yeah. Beats being held hostage.
Just barely.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.259
We haven't been officially introduced.
I'm Sara Ellis.

30:00.342 --> 30:01.510
-Alex.
-Hi.

30:02.553 --> 30:03.595
You're not a fed?

30:03.679 --> 30:04.721
No, no.

30:05.097 --> 30:07.057
Um, I work with Sterling Bosch.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.977
Insurance. How did you
get wrapped up in all this?

30:10.060 --> 30:11.979
Psst, psst. (CLEARS THROAT)

Across the room. Danger.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.899
So which one are you going for?

30:16.692 --> 30:18.986
-I'll be your wingman.
-No. I'm good, Jones.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.153
You sure?

30:20.445 --> 30:22.906
If I'm not out in ten minutes,
send backup.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.950
Sara. Alex.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.411
What are you two talking about?

30:29.454 --> 30:30.956
I should let you two catch up.

30:40.048 --> 30:41.300
I think she's great.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.635
It's not like that. It's...

30:43.719 --> 30:45.429
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

30:48.891 --> 30:50.517
How long have you known about the sub?

30:51.185 --> 30:52.436
Changing the subject.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.354
No. Maybe.

30:55.397 --> 30:56.523
I wanna know.

30:57.274 --> 30:59.651
-You know who my grandfather was?
-Yeah, Vogner.

30:59.735 --> 31:02.321
I've known about the sub
since I was a little girl.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.531
Grandpa, he'd take me to Coney Island

31:04.615 --> 31:07.743
when no one else was around
and he'd point out to the water

31:07.826 --> 31:10.996
and tell me that the greatest treasure
in the world was right out there,

31:11.079 --> 31:12.164
just below the waves.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.124
-The U-boat.
-Yes.

31:14.208 --> 31:18.003
He said the Nazis collected
the most beautiful things in the world.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.838
They put those things in a submarine.

31:19.922 --> 31:23.592
When it was crossing the Atlantic,
it went down, and no one could find it.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.345
He received the final SOS signal
from the sub.

31:26.428 --> 31:31.475
Yeah. He encoded the SOS antenna design
into the music box.

31:32.184 --> 31:33.852
He figured he'd come to America,

31:33.936 --> 31:36.522
he'd build a receiver,
and he'd find the sub.

31:36.605 --> 31:41.193
But he fled Germany after the war,
and the box was lost.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.904
But... he kept this.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.405
(ALEX CHUCKLES)

31:46.073 --> 31:48.784
Yeah. I always thought
they were just wonderful stories

31:48.867 --> 31:51.078
about treasure that was just out of reach.

31:51.161 --> 31:53.372
And then on his deathbed, he told me,

31:53.455 --> 31:55.541
"It's all true, Alex."

31:57.125 --> 31:58.836
And then he proved it.

31:59.962 --> 32:01.797
He gave me the key to the music box.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.549
"Find it," he said.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.969
-Your new destiny.
-Yeah.

32:07.928 --> 32:09.263
You remind me of this treasure.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.933
Some wonderful fantasy
that's just out of reach.

Hey, honey. Everything is fine.

32:42.254 --> 32:43.630
No, I'll tell you all about it.

32:45.507 --> 32:47.676
I just gave my statement,
so I'm gonna go home.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.762
Listen. What happened with Alex was not...

32:50.846 --> 32:52.556
Neal, stop it, all right?

32:52.639 --> 32:57.060
I'm a big girl,
and we need to stop kidding ourselves.

those little chickens you like.

-I know what they're called.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.284
Is that an order?

Yeah. Yeah, this will be fun.

the weather-stripping

33:25.297 --> 33:27.007
on the storefront on Monday.

33:27.090 --> 33:30.010
-And?
-And he said the reinforced foam

33:30.093 --> 33:32.262
is much more efficient
than the self-stick plastic.

33:37.976 --> 33:39.353
-Yes.
-Weather-stripping.

It's the latest controversy
rocking the Burke household.

33:42.439 --> 33:43.899
-Imagine that.
-Wow, that's...

-Yes.
-Please.

That's not easy, is it?

33:57.204 --> 34:00.791
Yeah, I would be lying
if I said I didn't worry about him.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.127
But I knew who he was
when I fell in love with him.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.297

No. Why would I?

they're talking about?

between me and Alex. I meant it.

36:17.261 --> 36:20.764
Now remember, Adler's men are armed,
so eyes and ears.

36:21.932 --> 36:22.933
Let's get to work.

36:26.603 --> 36:29.147
Adler is not getting away, Neal.
I won't let him.

36:29.982 --> 36:30.983
I know.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.364
(CLANGING IN DISTANCE)

36:48.208 --> 36:50.002
(CLANGING CONTINUES)

37:08.770 --> 37:10.731
ADLER: You always were persistent, Neal.

37:11.815 --> 37:14.401
One of the many qualities
I admire about you.

37:14.484 --> 37:16.820
-FBI is closing in, Adler.
-I know.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.198
There's an 18-wheeler just inside there

37:19.281 --> 37:21.867
loaded with a collection of art
more valuable than life.

37:21.950 --> 37:25.662
You help me get past the FBI perimeter,
half of it is yours.

37:25.746 --> 37:28.624
Wow, sounds like a really good deal.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.043
You must think I'm an idiot.

37:31.126 --> 37:32.836
I think you're an opportunist.

37:34.046 --> 37:35.506
You took everything from me.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.966
Only after you tried to do the same to me.

37:38.509 --> 37:40.010
All is fair in love and war.

37:40.093 --> 37:41.637
Tell me why Kate had to die.

37:42.513 --> 37:44.640
If you want my help now, tell me.

37:46.850 --> 37:49.061
The explosives on the plane were her idea.

37:49.937 --> 37:52.397
You parachute out over the ocean,
the plane explodes,

37:52.481 --> 37:53.565
you live happily ever after.

37:53.649 --> 37:56.401
But then she called,
said Burke had just arrived.

37:56.485 --> 37:59.947
Then, as now,
he threatened to ruin everything.

38:00.739 --> 38:02.324
So you blew up the plane early.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.868
Could have waited another 30 seconds
and you'd be dead, too.

38:05.744 --> 38:07.079
Am I supposed to be grateful?

38:08.497 --> 38:10.541
You were as close to a son as I ever had.

38:10.624 --> 38:11.792
No.

38:12.709 --> 38:13.919
I'm nothing like you.

38:15.754 --> 38:19.216
There's nothing sadder
than a con man conning himself.

38:19.299 --> 38:23.053
Come on, Neal.
Let's stop hurting the people we love.

38:23.136 --> 38:25.472
Let's bring this thing full circle.
You and me.

38:26.056 --> 38:27.850
Just like old times.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.269
Go to hell.

38:30.352 --> 38:31.353
(EXPLOSION)

38:34.147 --> 38:36.441
-Tell me you got the TNT out!
-ADLER: The thing must have spark...

38:36.525 --> 38:37.901
The art is gonna burn! Come on!

38:39.319 --> 38:40.696
It's clear. Nothing.

38:40.779 --> 38:42.406
(EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE)

38:44.408 --> 38:45.450
DIANA: Boss.

38:45.534 --> 38:46.869
Where the hell is Neal?

38:47.494 --> 38:48.495
Come on!

38:54.001 --> 38:56.003
-Go!
-Get down!

39:04.720 --> 39:06.305
Any more people on site yet?

39:06.388 --> 39:08.015
Fire department is 15 minutes away!

39:17.482 --> 39:18.567
(ADLER GRUNTING)

39:19.151 --> 39:20.611
-No. It's too late.
-Out of my way!

39:20.694 --> 39:22.070
It's too late. It's gone.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.287
-You did this.
-No.

39:30.913 --> 39:32.581
I took from you, now you take from me?

39:32.664 --> 39:34.249
I would never burn that art,
you know that.

39:34.666 --> 39:36.043
You won't get away with this.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.377
Good-bye, Neal.

39:37.878 --> 39:38.962
(GUNSHOT)

39:52.601 --> 39:53.685
He would have killed me.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.815
What did he mean,
"You won't get away with this"?

39:59.733 --> 40:00.984
I don't know.

40:02.361 --> 40:03.695
I'm glad you're all right.

40:09.326 --> 40:10.994
-You okay, Neal?
-Yeah.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.455
Come on. We'll get you back.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.186
Damn it, Neal.

40:38.856 --> 40:39.940
Neal.

40:46.446 --> 40:47.531
You did this.

40:47.948 --> 40:50.826
The fire, all of it. You did it.

40:50.909 --> 40:53.412
Peter, those were masterpieces.
I would never burn them.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.706
-You know that.
-No. But you'd steal them.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.040
You don't know what you're talking about.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.335
That long con on Adler
finally paid off, didn't it?

41:00.419 --> 41:02.212
You saw your chance, and then you took it.

41:02.296 --> 41:04.882
I don't know how
I don't know what game you are playing.

41:04.965 --> 41:06.341
I have no idea, Peter.

41:07.467 --> 41:10.429
I'm not lying to you now.
I didn't steal the art.

41:10.512 --> 41:11.930
I think you did.

41:13.515 --> 41:14.641
Then prove it.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.477
Prove it.

41:49.551 --> 41:50.552
