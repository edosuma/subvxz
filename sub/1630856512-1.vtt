00:21.800 --> 00:24.040
It's almost ten in the morning.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.640
We're heading up the mountain.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.320
It's a beautiful day
here in the Sierra Nevada.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.720
We're here with Carlitos Páez Vilaró,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.800
Vasco Echavarren,

00:34.440 --> 00:36.120
Coco Nicolich,

00:36.640 --> 00:37.840
Enrique Platero,

00:38.360 --> 00:40.920
and the amazing Antonio Vizintín.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.120
- We're happy to be here.
- Day two in the mountains.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.480
Day two in the mountains.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.760
I guess it feels colder today.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.840
Windier. The mountain awaits.
It welcomes us.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.320
It embraces us.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.120
And we embrace it back.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.360
{\an8}SOCIETY OF THE SNOW:
WHO WERE WE ON THE MOUNTAIN?

01:07.120 --> 01:10.560
I came across the book <i>Society of the Snow</i>
while doing research for <i>The Impossible</i>.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.080
DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, SCREENWRITER

01:12.160 --> 01:14.520
<i>The Impossible </i> took a year to film.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
PRODUCER

01:15.680 --> 01:18.200
On the last day of shooting,
Belén was on the phone

01:18.280 --> 01:20.400
with the lawyer
representing the survivors,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.040
ironing out the steps to take

01:25.120 --> 01:28.440
to make this film a reality.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.600
{\an8}On Friday, October 13, 1972,

01:30.680 --> 01:33.040
{\an8}a charter flight
from the Uruguayan Air Force

01:33.120 --> 01:35.040
{\an8}crashed in the middle of the Andes.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.120
{\an8}Sixteen of the 40 passengers
survived 72 days in the wilderness.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.920
{\an8}The event became known
as the Miracle of the Andes.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.440
When we heard about Bayona's film,
we started to get an idea

01:48.520 --> 01:51.080
for how the script
and everything would take shape.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.360
SURVIVOR

01:52.440 --> 01:56.400
We began to feel hopeful
and had a sense of relief and joy

01:56.480 --> 01:59.280
because the story would be told
with everyone included.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.160
We gave J.A. complete freedom

02:01.240 --> 02:04.240
in terms of the script
and just about everything else.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
SURVIVOR

02:05.400 --> 02:06.440
I only said to him,

02:06.520 --> 02:10.360
"Feel free to do whatever you want,
but know my life's at the heart of this."

02:10.440 --> 02:13.480
This was such a terrible tragedy,
at least for me.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.520
SURVIVOR

02:14.600 --> 02:18.880
Imagine losing your mother,
sister, and best friend on the same day

02:18.960 --> 02:21.280
and having to bury them
with your own hands.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.680
Living for 72 days
in the worst conditions possible.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.320
Taking the most epic trek
in the history of mountaineering.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.840
The movie illustrates the majestic…

02:30.920 --> 02:33.080
SISTER OF FERNANDO VÁZQUEZ, DECEASED

02:33.160 --> 02:39.000
…and terrible spirit of that place,
where nature dominates in full force.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.080
SURVIVOR

02:40.160 --> 02:44.560
Unless you see it with your own eyes,
you have no idea what it's like

02:45.080 --> 02:47.240
to set foot
in that enormous mountain range.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.960
Imagine what this is like for us.
It's like being transported back there.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.800
{\an8}October 2021. The team's first trip
to the Valley of Tears (the Andes),

03:00.880 --> 03:03.760
{\an8}the site of the crash.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.360
{\an8}The expedition is led by Benegas Brothers.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.360
{\an8}One of the most striking things
about the Valley of Tears,

03:13.440 --> 03:16.160
where the plane crashed,
is the sound of the place.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.640
Nothing lives there.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.360
There's complete silence.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.280
And then there are these gusts of wind,

03:22.360 --> 03:26.000
which, at a height of 13,000 feet,
are incredibly strong.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.440
The first time we went
to shoot in the Andes,

03:28.520 --> 03:31.280
there had hardly been
any snowfall that year.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.520
We filmed a lot and spent
some time exploring the surroundings,

03:35.600 --> 03:38.960
but we had to return
a year later to get footage.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.240
When shooting was wrapping up,
J.A., the cinematographer,

03:42.320 --> 03:46.040
the special effects supervisor,
and Enzo, our lead,

03:46.120 --> 03:49.600
went to get some footage
in the Valley of Tears.

03:49.680 --> 03:54.560
It turned out to be like something
out of a nature documentary.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.640
It was like the mountain
gave us its blessing.

04:00.480 --> 04:05.440
It snowed a lot, almost
as much as it had the year of the crash,

04:05.520 --> 04:08.440
which was one of the snowiest years
on record for the area.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.480
- What do I do?
- J.A. will tell you.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.560
{\an8}They asked us to get some information.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.440
{\an8}- And to talk to you.
<i>- Okay.</i>

04:29.520 --> 04:31.000
{\an8}SEPTEMBER 2021: ZOOM CALLS.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.280
So, you prefer the window over aisle seat.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.360
Do you prefer the window or the aisle?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.360
<i>Window or aisle?</i>

04:40.640 --> 04:42.560
<i>Uh, wait a second.</i>

04:43.160 --> 04:46.200
{\an8}THEY'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE NEWS
THAT WILL CHANGE THEIR LIVES…

04:47.440 --> 04:49.400
<i>- What?</i>
- Window or aisle?

04:49.480 --> 04:50.760
<i>I'm gonna be in the movie?</i>

04:50.840 --> 04:52.160
<i>Just tell me. Come on.</i>

04:52.240 --> 04:55.280
<i>Don't play around.</i>
<i>Come on. That's enough already.</i>

04:55.360 --> 04:58.200
María Laura Berch
did a spectacular job with casting.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
PRODUCER

04:59.360 --> 05:03.920
She later coached the actors
over six or seven long months.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.800
It really was the right decision
to not go with well-known actors.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.160
The goal was,
like with everything else in the film,

05:11.240 --> 05:13.600
to keep things organic
and close to real life.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.440
Are you on board?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.480
<i>You're the worst.</i>

05:28.120 --> 05:29.920
Why are you doing this?

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
<i>Wow.</i>

05:32.640 --> 05:35.200
<i>Wait, are you being serious?</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:43.240
We certainly were looking for
people who looked the part,

05:43.320 --> 05:48.320
but mostly, we wanted actors who already
had the personalities of their characters.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.640
These similarities, along with the fact
that we spent 140 days filming,

05:53.720 --> 05:56.960
meant that we formed

05:57.040 --> 06:00.360
our own Society of the Snow on set,
a lot like the one in the film.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.960
- You earned it.
- Wow. I can't believe it.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.520
<i>I need to play Roberto Canessa.</i>
<i>I mean, I want it.</i>

06:12.600 --> 06:17.640
<i>I wanted it so bad. I'm obsessed.</i>

06:19.240 --> 06:20.360
<i>No way.</i>

06:22.720 --> 06:24.840
<i>Holy shit.</i>

06:30.960 --> 06:32.080
Are you ready?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.720
<i>Yeah. Let's do this.</i>

06:45.920 --> 06:50.120
<i>Led by Bayona</i>

06:50.200 --> 06:53.200
<i>We're all gonna take a victory lap!</i>

06:53.280 --> 06:57.440
<i>Come on, sing with me…</i>

06:58.480 --> 07:01.520
{\an8}DECEMBER 2021: REHEARSALS
AND TRAINING IN BARCELONA

07:02.040 --> 07:07.160
Today's workout focuses
on the lower body, and it's a tough one.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.160
We have to complete four sets today,
working the entire leg.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.080
You're going to do ten reps,
holding each one for three seconds.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.760
Three, four.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.480
One, two, three.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.320
Nice job. Ease down. Squeeze. Lift.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.720
That's it!

07:30.800 --> 07:33.400
- Come on.
- Push. Keep it up.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.560
- Come on, champ.
- Up. Six. Knees apart.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
Four.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.200
Ten.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.960
Great session today, guys.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.480
A tough one but a good one.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.400
Time to head home, rest up, and eat.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.240
I died on December 11, 1972,
at ten in the morning.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.360
I was the 29th person to depart
from the journey we began 58 days ago,

08:00.440 --> 08:02.440
leaving 16 friends to carry on.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.040
J.A. did an amazing job directing.

08:06.120 --> 08:11.080
I think it's one of the aspects
of the project that he enjoyed the most.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.920
Many of our actors were inexperienced
or had only done theater.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.360
They weren't used to being on camera,
but with J.A. as director,

08:20.440 --> 08:23.120
and under his careful supervision,
they really shined.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.960
Nando wants to venture out now,
but he's scared.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.600
When Roberto says, "Let's fix the radio,"

08:28.680 --> 08:31.240
Nando says,
"That won't work. Let's just go."

08:31.320 --> 08:33.840
So Roberto says,
"Let's try to get it to work."

08:33.919 --> 08:37.159
"If it doesn't,
then we can head up into the mountains."

08:37.240 --> 08:39.559
That works for Nando
because he's scared too.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.240
He thinks, "Fine. At least Roberto's in."

08:42.320 --> 08:43.760
Go. That's it!

08:43.840 --> 08:45.720
- Up!
- Here!

08:45.800 --> 08:46.920
Get down!

08:47.000 --> 08:48.080
Get up!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.280
You're up there!

08:50.360 --> 08:52.200
Get up in four.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.320
You're totally exhausted.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.280
You have to give your actors
what they need.

08:59.360 --> 09:05.280
All the information and help you can.

09:05.360 --> 09:11.480
My approach to working with actors
is to basically give them space.

09:11.560 --> 09:17.720
That means giving them room to experiment,
to make mistakes if they need to.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.240
I tell them, "Make mistakes.
It's fine. We can just do another take."

09:21.320 --> 09:22.720
So they can try things out.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.280
But to do that,
they need to have all the information.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.080
We're leaving for Granada
in four days, and I can't believe it.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.320
It's going to be really intense but great.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.280
We can't wait to get out there
and get started.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.080
Are we gonna say cheese?

09:48.160 --> 09:49.440
Cheese!

10:01.800 --> 10:04.440
We built five fuselages.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.880
The small ones, the one on the gimbal,
and the two here.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.960
PRODUCTION DESIGNER

10:09.040 --> 10:11.160
Each has a specific purpose.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.160
It might seem crazy
to have five, but it isn't really.

10:14.240 --> 10:20.760
They all have different functions,
so they work together as one.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.000
The challenge with the fuselage
on the mountain was getting it there.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.800
We built it here in Madrid
and transported it in one piece

10:31.880 --> 10:35.240
to the Sierra Nevada,
where we dismantled it into three parts

10:35.320 --> 10:40.960
and brought it up the slopes
to the location, which was very high up.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.880
Not as high as Veleta peak,

10:42.960 --> 10:46.600
but it was in the most elevated part
of the Sierra Nevada.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.280
{\an8}DECEMBER 13, 2021:
TRANSPORTING THE FUSELAGE TO GRANADA

11:13.600 --> 11:18.960
While we had that plane there,
we also had one at ground level,

11:19.040 --> 11:21.600
in the middle
of an olive grove in Granada.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.520
That particular one
was able to be lifted up and down.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.240
We built a platform that allowed us
to raise and lower the entire plane.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.440
So, we spread
artificial snow around the plane.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.920
SPECIAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR

11:36.000 --> 11:40.240
And then you could lower it and raise it
to change the level of snow coverage.

11:43.640 --> 11:49.960
SPECIAL EFFECTS SNOW SUPERVISOR

12:08.720 --> 12:12.920
And then we had a third plane,
which was on a set

12:13.000 --> 12:14.400
up in the mountains.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.080
At an altitude of 6,500 feet.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.280
We built a warehouse with LED screens

12:19.360 --> 12:22.480
to recreate the mountains
because we avoid using green screens.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.760
And then, for the crash scene,
we made replicas of the plane.

12:25.840 --> 12:32.840
One of these
was like a fourth plane on a gimbal.

12:32.920 --> 12:39.440
It allowed us to change the angle

12:39.520 --> 12:43.440
and create turbulence similar
to the kind you'd have on a real flight.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.400
And then we used
smaller pieces of the plane

12:46.480 --> 12:51.920
to produce more intense turbulence
for the crash, for specific shots.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.840
Delta, plate one alpha, second.

13:16.440 --> 13:22.320
The day we began filming,
the director and all the actors had COVID.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.200
{\an8}- Where does Pancho Abal go?
- First.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.520
{\an8}He goes first. Let's go.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.920
{\an8}WEEK 1: FILMING BEGINS

13:30.720 --> 13:34.160
So we started the first day
with the director stuck in a booth,

13:34.240 --> 13:36.520
wearing his face mask, alone,

13:36.600 --> 13:38.920
with a microphone,
far away from everyone else,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.080
sending instructions
to the set and directing body doubles.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.240
We could only film from behind.
The real actors were out sick.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.840
Heads up, folks. We're starting.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.400
The first few days,
J.A. wasn't with us since he had COVID.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.840
WRITER, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER

13:58.920 --> 14:03.200
But we heard his voice, and it was
like it came from beyond the grave.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
Action!

14:04.360 --> 14:07.680
You're freezing. Vacant stares.
You're going to die tonight.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.400
I want to see that you're going to die,
that you think you're dying.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.480
- Platero.
- I'm not convinced you're going to die!

14:14.560 --> 14:15.880
It was all very strange.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.680
I couldn't think of a more perfect way

14:18.760 --> 14:22.760
to mirror the '72 incident, which sat
somewhere between reality and surreality,

14:22.840 --> 14:25.760
life and death,
than how we kicked off the shoot.

14:25.840 --> 14:30.160
We've been waiting for this moment
for over a year, since the casting call.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.120
And to be here now, it's like, "Finally."

14:33.200 --> 14:38.720
The first scenes were close-ups of Numa.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.280
It felt like we were starting strong.
It was awesome.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.040
A lot of this is in here.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.880
But yeah, it's really intense.
Really powerful.

14:47.960 --> 14:53.360
Every scene takes a lot out of you.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.600
There are times when we're waiting
for the cameras to roll,

14:56.680 --> 15:01.600
and you can't help but think,
"Wow. This is a true story."

15:01.680 --> 15:05.120
The first few days,
as the actors began to recover,

15:05.200 --> 15:07.000
they started coming in one by one.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.800
We kept trying to figure out
which shots we could film each day.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.840
Let's keep the frame.
Set up the lighting, please.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.400
A little more snow.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.840
More snow on Marcelo.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.400
I'm starting to feel
like I'm getting the hang of it.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.840
J.A. was outside the booth today,
so that made a big difference.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.040
He was there with us.
We tried different things. It was great.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.280
On set, there's a mountain
to climb every single day.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.560
A metaphorical mountain.

15:40.640 --> 15:45.240
Every time we got to a new scene, we'd go,
"Now we have to film the avalanche."

15:45.320 --> 15:48.720
"Now we have to scale
the mountain in the west…"

15:48.800 --> 15:55.680
All the scenes were physically
and technically demanding.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.200
Help!

16:06.840 --> 16:09.920
Numa, are you okay? Numa!

16:10.000 --> 16:12.040
- Help!
- Numa!

16:12.120 --> 16:15.040
- Please!
- Vasco, where are you? Vasco!

16:21.080 --> 16:22.520
Numa, where are you?

16:25.320 --> 16:29.160
- Cut.
- Great job, Juan Diego. Excellent.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.000
- Nicely done, brother.
- We made it.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.800
We survived, man.
We almost got our heads chopped off.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.000
Very intense.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.000
Really cold.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.120
Roberto.

16:40.760 --> 16:41.800
Nando.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.800
{\an8}WEEK 2: THE TEAM GOES UP
TO THE MOUNTAIN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME…

16:49.240 --> 16:51.240
{\an8}AT AN ELEVATION OF ALMOST 9,850 FEET

16:52.000 --> 16:55.480
{\an8}SOME OF THE ACTORS
HAD NEVER SEEN SNOW BEFORE.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.880
Working around the conditions
on the mountain was the hardest part.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.000
You can't control the mountain,
so <i>you </i> have to adapt to it.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.560
And adapting within the time constraints
was the biggest challenge.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.680
Especially with so much of the crew
being away from home,

17:22.760 --> 17:28.680
posted up in a ski resort
right in the middle of peak season.

17:28.760 --> 17:32.520
It was all really complicated.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.840
We set out to do something
that was truly challenging.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.200
CINEMATOGRAPHER

17:37.280 --> 17:41.840
We wanted to reach places
that are really difficult to access

17:41.920 --> 17:44.560
with proper equipment, with good cameras,

17:44.640 --> 17:50.960
with something that would let us capture
the majesty of those places

17:51.040 --> 17:54.200
in the best way possible.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.560
We were filming at an elevation
of 9,842 feet in a snowy location

18:00.640 --> 18:02.320
with safety measures in place.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.680
It was difficult to get around.
We had to do things slowly.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.160
We were trying to get into the rhythm
of the film right away.

18:09.240 --> 18:16.240
So it took us a while
to get into our stride and make progress.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.440
Come on. That's great.
Pull it for another ten feet.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.280
Carlitos, face the camera.
Let us see what you're doing.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.080
Wipe off any blood that's on you.
Stay with Carlitos.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
What happened to your nose today?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.960
- I had a nosebleed.
- Why?

18:29.480 --> 18:30.680
It just happens.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.280
- The altitude, physical exertion…
- What did you do?

18:33.360 --> 18:35.840
- Did you clean yourself up?
- They used it.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.120
{\an8}We're almost done for the day.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.080
{\an8}Time for a nice sunset,
a final scene, and one last shot.

18:43.760 --> 18:47.200
We have to take advantage
of this beautiful light.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.080
- Let's move on to scene 41.
- Action.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.360
- All right.
- Final slate.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
Taking it easy.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.320
Great. Beautiful.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.280
I'll just say this now.
Today we're having paella.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.520
What a strange coincidence it would be
if the nutritionist were to show up.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.040
All the characters, from the day
of the accident until they're rescued,

19:41.120 --> 19:42.840
progressively lose weight.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.840
It's gonna be tough, but we need to do it

19:45.920 --> 19:48.440
to play our characters
and do justice to the story.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.480
It adds to the performance,
and we're all on board.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.960
They have dulce de leche mousse,
and I can't even eat it.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.320
- Where's the dulce de leche?
- Here. It's a mousse.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.800
- This?
- The one without a label.

20:00.880 --> 20:04.400
- Don't worry. I'll eat it for you.
- Wow, thanks.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.320
- It is what it is.
- Check it out. It smells awful.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.080
Son of a… I can't believe this.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.520
SPECIAL EFFECTS AND MAKEUP

20:11.600 --> 20:15.760
As the days go by, makeup is being used
to accentuate their transformations,

20:15.840 --> 20:19.080
and that definitely adds to the film.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.640
The actors were brave enough
to take the plunge

20:22.720 --> 20:26.280
and shoot the film chronologically,
losing weight as time went on.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.480
{\an8}I got a cold sore from not eating enough.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.120
{\an8}- You're not eating, right?
- A cold sore from all the hard work.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.560
{\an8}I'm down 44 pounds.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.000
- Quit bragging about that.
- All right.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.480
When was the last time you ate?

20:38.560 --> 20:41.480
Back in December of last year.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.440
Hang in there!

20:47.160 --> 20:49.440
{\an8}We're filming the avalanche.
March 2, 2022.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.920
{\an8}WEEK 8: THE AVALANCHE SCENE

20:51.000 --> 20:54.520
{\an8}- Silence now, please.
- I'm going to squeeze in here.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.000
They want silence.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.840
Heads up. We're about to roll.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
In this film, silence is everything.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.920
The actors had
a rough time filming the avalanche.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.120
You can see it
on their faces throughout the scene.

21:20.680 --> 21:25.360
For the avalanche, we set up
some snow cannons… air cannons.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.680
We filled them and shot them off

21:27.760 --> 21:31.120
into the plane, causing the suitcases
and everything else to fall.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.320
Rolling.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.480
{\an8}FOR THE ACTORS' SAFETY,
RUBBER SUITCASES WERE USED

22:04.720 --> 22:07.760
The actors had to emerge from the ground.

22:09.080 --> 22:13.600
We had several hollow platforms.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.240
They had to wait for their turn
to come out through a hole,

22:17.320 --> 22:21.960
and they had to break through
a thick layer of real snow.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.120
It was extremely cold and freezing.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.640
It's really distressing.

22:37.720 --> 22:41.160
I don't know how they survived.
It blows my mind.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.560
Even the tiniest bit of snow
starts to sting.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.200
It suffocates you
and makes you feel helpless.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
Hold on!

22:52.880 --> 22:55.320
- It's intense.
- It's incre… I don't know.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.800
We didn't expect
the avalanche to be this tough.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.160
It's a struggle, but it looks awesome.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.920
Up!

23:10.760 --> 23:11.920
Cut.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.440
{\an8}WEEK 12. A THIRD UNIT
HANDLES THE HIGH-ALTITUDE SCENES.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.320
{\an8}The Sierra Nevada
has certainly been a challenge.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.920
Unlike any other set
or outdoor environment

23:26.000 --> 23:29.120
where we usually shoot,
this is a mountain.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.040
It's an inhospitable place.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.800
Working at such a high altitude
really limited us.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.680
It's been a challenge shooting
in the mountains at such an elevation.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.160
{\an8}THE THIRD UNIT IS LED
BY A NORWEGIAN DIRECTOR

23:42.240 --> 23:45.000
{\an8}AND A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
WHO IS AN EXPERT IN SNOWBOARDING.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.840
Three, two, one. Let's start walking.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.720
You're going to climb up
and set up your bivouac,

24:02.800 --> 24:06.000
which is the bed, on top of this rock.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.240
DIRECTOR, MOUNTAIN UNIT

24:07.320 --> 24:10.200
We'll start from below,
then bring the camera up

24:10.280 --> 24:12.280
and begin the dialogue again from above.

24:12.360 --> 24:16.720
If we have time, we'll do it again,
but I'm not sure we will.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.040
That's all.

24:21.480 --> 24:26.720
As you know, the main characters go on
several expeditions

24:26.800 --> 24:29.400
in search of supplies.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.280
Eventually, they try
to make their way to civilization.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.560
That's basically
what we've tried to capture.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.200
{\an8}THEY REACH THE HIGHEST POINTS
OF THE SIERRA NEVADA,

24:38.280 --> 24:40.280
{\an8}AT AN ELEVATION OF ALMOST 10,830 FEET.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.040
Great job, guys.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.800
Nando too. One second.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.880
Look towards the camera a little.

25:05.080 --> 25:11.400
{\an8}WEEK 16: LAST WEEK IN THE SIERRA NEVADA,
FILMING THE RESCUE SCENE.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.320
The last day of shooting
in the Sierra Nevada,

25:14.400 --> 25:17.360
at the exterior fuselage on the mountain,

25:17.440 --> 25:19.200
we were filming the arrival of…

25:19.280 --> 25:23.520
I get emotional talking about it.
The arrival of the rescue helicopters.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.000
The survivors know that Nando
and Canessa have made it to safety,

25:27.080 --> 25:32.760
and they're getting ready to be rescued
and coming to terms with the last 72 days.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.320
They're about to leave
what has been their home

25:35.400 --> 25:37.120
and the society they've created.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.360
They're eager to return home and wondering

25:39.440 --> 25:42.600
how the world will react
to what they've been through.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.240
A wonderful yet intense period
is coming to an end.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.320
The hardest one yet.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.080
It has been very demanding,
both physically and emotionally.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.240
But we're very glad
we got to experience this whole process,

25:54.840 --> 25:56.000
and we're grateful.

25:56.080 --> 26:00.400
My experience in the Sierra Nevada,
Granada, and Spain will stay with me.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.760
When the helicopters arrived,

26:05.840 --> 26:08.520
I believe our entire team…

26:08.600 --> 26:13.600
I won't go as far as to say we felt
what the survivors felt on the mountain,

26:13.680 --> 26:16.200
but we had our own moment of…

26:17.760 --> 26:18.760
"It's finally over."

26:18.840 --> 26:21.480
We still have a lot to film,
but that difficult part,

26:21.560 --> 26:25.640
dealing with the mountain, the fuselage,
the characters, the weight loss,

26:25.720 --> 26:28.920
the struggles of living together,
and COVID on top of that,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.720
as well as having to live
in an isolated mountain village…

26:32.800 --> 26:37.640
That period of intense concentration,
effort, working hours, energy,

26:37.720 --> 26:41.920
suffering, joy, and focus on technique…
had come to an end.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.360
Yeah, I'm done.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.360
That was great. Thanks.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
It's over.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.800
I believe it's one
of the most emotional moments

26:51.880 --> 26:54.280
I've ever experienced on a film set.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.320
It was incredible.

27:05.920 --> 27:11.400
{\an8}WEEK 20: THE TEAM HEADS TO URUGUAY
TO SHOOT THE END OF THE FILM.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.720
CHILEAN AIR FORCE

27:56.200 --> 27:59.560
It's a miracle.

27:59.640 --> 28:05.520
- What do you mean, a miracle, Mom?
- It's a miracle.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.400
Cut. Great job.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.880
WELCOME TO SAN FERNANDO

28:36.960 --> 28:38.000
WELCOME

28:44.520 --> 28:46.440
CHILE AND URUGUAY

29:07.560 --> 29:09.640
Thank you, everybody!

29:09.720 --> 29:12.520
Incredible work! Come on, everyone!

29:18.440 --> 29:22.200
{\an8}Three, two, one. Action.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.600
{\an8}DECEMBER 2022: CRASH SCENE,
NETFLIX STUDIOS, MADRID

29:26.800 --> 29:28.640
Cut.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.120
We asked ourselves
how we were going to film the crash,

29:37.200 --> 29:42.880
knowing that Bayona relies
on realistic practical effects,

29:42.960 --> 29:47.400
using real actors and also stunt doubles.

29:47.480 --> 29:53.280
Also, how could we incorporate one of
the many things that Bayona excels at,

29:53.360 --> 29:58.480
which is making the viewer feel
like they're in the scene,

29:58.560 --> 30:00.480
right in the middle of the action?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.840
Three, two, one. Action.

30:11.120 --> 30:15.200
We mainly have small sets
for specific shots.

30:15.280 --> 30:20.240
Then we have half a fuselage on a gimbal

30:20.320 --> 30:25.320
to get all the movements and real inclines

30:25.400 --> 30:27.280
along with the turbulence.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.080
Then we have a full moving fuselage.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.080
We use this plane to show

30:34.160 --> 30:37.960
normal flying conditions,
when the passengers play cards,

30:38.040 --> 30:40.480
mess around, get rowdy,
and stuff like that.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.480
Real planes can reach this angle,
and it's historically accurate.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.960
A ball is rolling on the floor.
Action! Pancho, look out the window!

30:48.040 --> 30:50.600
You're about to crash!
The plane's right in front!

30:50.680 --> 30:51.880
And then, sun!

30:51.960 --> 30:53.520
And cut.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.120
Stunt-wire work
has become a key part of this film

31:01.200 --> 31:07.640
because it allows us to move
at the speed and in the direction we want.

31:07.720 --> 31:11.320
We had to prepare
the seats in the fuselage

31:11.400 --> 31:13.760
so that the actors could do the stunts.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.880
STUNT SUPERVISOR

31:18.560 --> 31:23.080
We modified all the seats
and added more foam to them.

31:23.160 --> 31:30.040
With the help of the special effects team,
we created rubber trays and armrests

31:30.120 --> 31:35.600
to keep the actors safe
while filming the crash sequences.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.800
All the backdrops used
in the movie are real.

31:44.880 --> 31:49.080
They're footage and photographs
taken in the Andes.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.920
Since it's based on a true story,

31:52.000 --> 31:55.360
the audience doesn't want it
to look digital.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.000
You can sense that it's not real.

31:58.080 --> 32:02.600
I'm really happy
with Félix Bergés's and Ranchito's work.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.560
One, two, three, cut!

32:18.480 --> 32:20.120
Gastón!

32:29.440 --> 32:30.760
We thought they were dead.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.160
Uruguay!

32:32.240 --> 32:34.840
The film gives a voice
to those who didn't return home.

32:34.920 --> 32:40.120
I feel like it has provided answers
to all the lingering questions.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.800
It was an emotional period,
and this is much more than just a movie.

32:45.880 --> 32:50.040
Through this film,
we reach levels of awareness

32:50.120 --> 32:51.720
that we had no idea existed.

32:51.800 --> 32:56.880
It's the movie that has truly
taught me the most, every step of the way.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.360
It was an emotional roller coaster,

32:59.440 --> 33:03.200
but we all agreed
that what really kept us going

33:03.280 --> 33:07.600
was the camaraderie
and the friendships that we forged.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.200
<i>Many times I was locked up…</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:14.040
Even now, it's hard to believe.

33:14.120 --> 33:18.680
I don't know how they survived,
but because they returned home,

33:19.440 --> 33:21.400
we were able to find out what happened.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.800
Instead of just recounting the events,

33:23.880 --> 33:26.200
the film shows what happened to this group

33:26.280 --> 33:29.880
and how they had
to face their own mortality.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.040
Folks, that's a wrap.

33:32.120 --> 33:37.080
{\an8}SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2022:
SHOOTING WRAPS ON SOCIETY OF THE SNOW

33:38.880 --> 33:44.920
The movie obviously stirs up
a lot of emotions.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.480
Bayona has brought us all back together
50 years after the events.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.480
SISTER OF FELIPE MAQUIRRIAIN, DECEASED

33:50.560 --> 33:53.240
The story had never been told
like this until now.

33:53.320 --> 33:57.600
Bayona is the kind of person
who doesn't quit until the scene is right.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.320
He won't stop trying
to get the shot until it moves him

34:02.400 --> 34:04.280
and really makes him feel something.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.720
It totally changed how I see acting.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.199
I believe it has given us tools

34:10.280 --> 34:13.239
to work on other projects
in the future and grow as actors.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.440
Sometimes, you want to wring his neck.
Other times, you want to give him a hug.

34:17.520 --> 34:23.400
But this experience has definitely
helped me grow as a person and an actor.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.600
<i>My dear J.A.</i>

34:26.679 --> 34:30.000
<i>You are the joy</i>

34:30.080 --> 34:34.000
<i>Of my heart in every way</i>

34:34.080 --> 34:38.320
I believe J.A.
has poured his heart into this story,

34:38.400 --> 34:41.280
putting in a lot of work with Pablo,

34:41.360 --> 34:44.040
to perhaps make the best film of his life.

34:44.120 --> 34:51.000
We've all heard the story of the heroes
who crossed the Andes and returned home.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.199
But the story of the anonymous heroes

34:54.280 --> 34:57.400
who allowed the survivors to return
hadn't been told until now.

34:57.480 --> 35:02.320
When you see someone
so invested in a story from day one

35:02.400 --> 35:04.200
and their attention to detail,

35:04.280 --> 35:08.160
that's when you know
there's an unbreakable connection there.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.440
DAUGHTER OF JAVIER AND LILIANA METHOL

35:10.520 --> 35:14.960
In my eyes, J.A. has become almost like
a member of our community of survivors.

35:15.040 --> 35:20.960
The film creates a space
for us to revisit who we were.

35:23.200 --> 35:30.120
{\an8}SOCIETY OF THE SNOW:
WHO WERE WE ON THE MOUNTAIN?

36:12.440 --> 36:17.440
