00:02.577 --> 00:06.037
Fine. Would you care to make
a charitable donation towards...

00:06.084 --> 00:07.244
No, thanks, sorry.

00:07.245 --> 00:08.845
I haven't said what it's for yet.

00:08.885 --> 00:10.185
Yeah, but it will be a no, though.

00:10.212 --> 00:12.372
We're in a bit of a rush.
No, we're not. Are we not?

00:12.412 --> 00:15.012
Oh well, if you're not...
Because you have that audition.

00:15.052 --> 00:17.532
We've got loads of time.
What are you collecting for?

00:17.572 --> 00:19.892
Our injured and retired servicemen,
darling.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.892
Here's 10 denari.

00:21.932 --> 00:23.572
10? That's quite a lot.

00:23.612 --> 00:25.212
Thank you, love.

00:25.252 --> 00:27.252
And you, sir?

00:27.565 --> 00:29.565
Yes, OK, fine.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.845
Here's another 10, then.

00:31.885 --> 00:35.285
Splendid! And here are your
I Helped Conquer Britain badges.

00:37.085 --> 00:39.085
Thanks.

00:40.365 --> 00:42.525
OK, so you're gonna have
to get our money back.

00:42.565 --> 00:44.405
Really, why?

00:44.445 --> 00:48.125
My family are in Britain, I'm not
helping to conquer it. Get it back.

00:48.165 --> 00:50.805
I just don't think that's really
the done thing, though.

00:50.845 --> 00:52.885
Quickly. Please. Before we lose him.

00:54.765 --> 00:56.525
OK. Sorry!

00:56.565 --> 00:58.365
Hello. Sorry, hi.

00:58.405 --> 01:01.245
Hello again. We didn't
realise, she's actually from Britain

01:01.285 --> 01:03.205
so we are gonna need to
get that money back.

01:03.245 --> 01:04.845
It's already in the tin.

01:04.885 --> 01:07.045
Yeah, but you can open
the tin, though, surely?

01:07.085 --> 01:09.605
No. You can. Otherwise
you would be able to bank it.

01:09.645 --> 01:12.085
Oh, so you're the fucking
tin expert suddenly, are you?

01:12.125 --> 01:14.325
No, no.
I just... If I could just have it.

01:14.645 --> 01:17.165
Get your bloody hands off my tin.
I'm sure if I can just.

01:17.205 --> 01:18.805
Get back, you little ponce!

01:18.845 --> 01:20.965
All right, calm down.
What's going on?

01:22.965 --> 01:24.645
Agghh! Oh, my God!

01:24.685 --> 01:26.325
Help, help, help.

01:26.365 --> 01:27.925
Not the face.
Help!

01:27.965 --> 01:29.039
Not the face.

01:29.040 --> 01:44.085

01:46.445 --> 01:49.445
It looks like your eye
is sort of growing a plum.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.045
Right, thanks for that, Grumio.

01:51.085 --> 01:53.085
You know,
you should really report that guy.

01:53.125 --> 01:56.005
Well, I would, but
you know, it's a bit embarrassing,

01:56.045 --> 01:58.645
because, you know,
he was sort of older than me.

01:58.725 --> 02:01.565
Why is that embarrassing?
Because he's much older.

02:01.885 --> 02:04.405
How much older?
Well it's hard to say exactly.

02:05.085 --> 02:09.324
Yeah, but probably
around 50 years...

02:09.365 --> 02:11.245
50 years old or 50 years older?

02:11.285 --> 02:13.605
Hmm, yeah, older.
He was in his seventies?

02:14.165 --> 02:17.365
Well, early seventies and he was
very sprightly, to be fair to him.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.725
Oh, that's not cool.
I'm not saying it's cool, am I?

02:19.765 --> 02:22.285
That's older than my nan
and she needs help out the bath.

02:22.325 --> 02:23.965
Don't compare him to your nan, OK.

02:24.005 --> 02:26.445
This guy was a veteran, you know,
he's a trained killer.

02:26.485 --> 02:28.165
Yeah, but trained when?
Like ages ago?

02:28.205 --> 02:31.485
It doesn't matter, does it?
Once you're trained, you're trained.

02:31.525 --> 02:34.245
What did Cynthia make of it?
Well, she did dab my face.

02:34.285 --> 02:36.765
Hey, result! Yeah, but
then she called me a poor lamb.

02:36.805 --> 02:38.805
Oh, no.
I know. Of all the animals.

02:39.645 --> 02:41.645
No-one wants to fuck a lamb.

02:42.085 --> 02:44.605
I'm not sure I'm really cut out
for this. For what?

02:44.645 --> 02:46.365
I don't know, life.

02:46.405 --> 02:48.005
Oh, come on, man, it will pick up.

02:48.045 --> 02:50.245
You know, one door closes
and another door opens.

02:50.285 --> 02:54.405
You reckon? Because right now
it's more like one door gets
repeatedly slammed into my nuts.

02:54.445 --> 02:56.445
'Ey up.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074

03:06.525 --> 03:09.045
So, this is the
dining room/conference area.

03:09.445 --> 03:12.045
Those tiles may look cracked,
but that's deliberate.

03:12.085 --> 03:13.685
That's actually a mosaic.

03:13.725 --> 03:15.725
Ah, landlord. Sorry!

03:15.965 --> 03:19.525
Oh, hello boys, all right?
Yeah, fine. Sorry, who is this?

03:19.565 --> 03:21.965
Oh, yes. Allow me
to introduce you to Irina.

03:22.165 --> 03:24.005
Lovely to meet you.

03:24.045 --> 03:25.645
Hi, hello, I'm Stylax.

03:25.685 --> 03:27.445
And what are those?

03:27.485 --> 03:29.445
Oh, and allow me to introduce
you to bananae.

03:29.485 --> 03:31.085
It's a fruit.

03:31.125 --> 03:34.125
They're very popular back home.
I'm trying to sell them here.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.005
Oh, amazing. Can I try a bit?

03:36.045 --> 03:38.045
Oh sure, of course.

03:40.285 --> 03:42.285
Hmm, that's gorgeous.

03:46.525 --> 03:48.725
Sorry? Sorry?
What the hell is going on?

03:49.085 --> 03:52.605
So, if you'd just like to step
into the bathroom/study for a sec.

03:54.005 --> 03:55.685
Here, keep it.

03:55.725 --> 03:57.725
I have many.

04:00.205 --> 04:01.565
So what happened to your face, then?

04:01.605 --> 04:03.685
He got beaten up by an old man.
Man! Just say man.

04:03.725 --> 04:05.365
Oh, dear. How old are we talking?

04:05.405 --> 04:07.125
Mid-seventies.
It's not important.

04:07.165 --> 04:09.005
Why is that woman in our bathroom?

04:09.045 --> 04:11.045
Ah, well, Irina's from Thrace,

04:11.445 --> 04:13.925
which you may have heard
we've just conquered.

04:13.965 --> 04:16.084
So now they're all flooding
over here.

04:16.165 --> 04:17.765
To our flat?

04:17.805 --> 04:21.565
Yeah, well she just needs
something temporary until
her banana business gets going.

04:21.605 --> 04:23.165
I was gonna send her packing,

04:23.205 --> 04:25.405
but then I thought,
'Hang on a minute.

04:25.445 --> 04:29.005
The boys might wanna hold onto her.'
Ah, good thinking.

04:29.045 --> 04:30.685
Right, but for nothing?

04:30.725 --> 04:32.805
Oh, absolutely.
It won't cost you a thing.

04:32.845 --> 04:35.925
No, I mean, we pay the same rent
and have another person living here?

04:35.965 --> 04:37.645
Correct.
So what's in it for us?

04:37.685 --> 04:40.885
Well, she is. You know
what they say about Thracian women?

04:40.925 --> 04:42.805
No.
What do they say?

04:42.845 --> 04:44.445
Dirty.
Really?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.485
Oh, yeah, filthy in the bedroom.

04:47.685 --> 04:51.085
So what do you say? You interested?
Yes, we are. No, thank you.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.165
A quick word if I may.

04:57.085 --> 04:59.005
Where would she even stay?
We don't have a spare room.

04:59.045 --> 05:01.325
No, we don't need one,
because, right, hear me out.

05:01.365 --> 05:02.965
I've thought this through.
But how?

05:03.005 --> 05:04.685
We've only just met her.

05:04.725 --> 05:07.565
Yeah, but I've had this exact
fantasy loads, right?

05:07.645 --> 05:10.365
And what we do is we give her
my room and then I come in with you.

05:10.405 --> 05:12.525
Ah, no. No, no, we are not sharing
a bed.

05:12.685 --> 05:14.405
Yeah, but we won't have to,
not for long.

05:14.445 --> 05:16.405
Because, right,
here's the genius bit.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.445
Oh, I'm glad there's a genius bit.
There is.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.005
After, like, one or two nights
me and her get it on

05:21.045 --> 05:22.765
and then
I get my room back anyway.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.565
And what if she doesn't fancy you?

05:24.605 --> 05:26.325
What? One - she's filthy.

05:26.365 --> 05:27.965
Two - she does.

05:28.005 --> 05:29.605
Even you couldn't miss those vibes.

05:29.645 --> 05:32.605
I know you fancy her. She had you
eating out of her hand, literally.

05:32.645 --> 05:34.525
I'm not cleaning up
after someone else.

05:34.565 --> 05:36.325
I've got enough on my plate as it is.

05:36.365 --> 05:38.965
OK, look, look. Both of you,
stop cock blocking me.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.165
I'm not doing that.
I don't know how to do that.

05:41.205 --> 05:43.045
First, Cynthia's out of bounds.

05:43.085 --> 05:45.845
And now her. It's like
you're a human chastity belt, mate.

05:45.885 --> 05:49.245
You won't rest till you've cut off
my wang and locked me in a dungeon.

05:49.285 --> 05:51.685
OK, that is honestly
not my long-term plan.

05:51.725 --> 05:54.565
I just don't wanna live with
a random fruit seller from Thrace.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.205
Yeah, but, you know, she
is exactly what this place needs.

05:57.245 --> 05:59.245
You know, a woman's touch.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.445
And fruit!

06:01.485 --> 06:04.085
And she's nice.
OK, what are you basing that on?

06:06.885 --> 06:08.885
Irina, sorry.
Yes?

06:08.965 --> 06:10.965
You're nice, right?
Yes, very nice.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.805
Yeah.

06:14.685 --> 06:16.365
OK, well that checks out.

06:16.405 --> 06:18.525
Please let me keep
the dirty Thracian.

06:18.805 --> 06:21.525
I'll look after her.
Come on, man. Throw me a bone.

06:29.525 --> 06:31.165
No, I don't want to,
I don't want to.

06:31.205 --> 06:32.805
I don't like the look of it.

06:32.845 --> 06:35.445
Just try a bit. You're
trying to get it on my bloody face.

06:35.485 --> 06:37.285
Come on, just try a bit.
Stay away from me!

06:37.525 --> 06:39.485
All right, chill out.
I said I don't like it.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.965
Why is it penis-shaped anyway?
You're penis shaped.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.645
What? No, I'm not. You are actually.
I'm just standing up.

06:44.685 --> 06:47.165
An erect penis then.
I do not look like an erect penis.

06:47.205 --> 06:49.405
Oh, I don't know, water boy.
You are a bit of a prick!

06:49.445 --> 06:51.725
Water man. Copier,
what's wrong with your face?

06:51.765 --> 06:54.525
Yes, he claims to have slipped.
I did slip, it was an accident.

06:54.565 --> 06:57.885
Right, that sounds suspiciously
like the sort of thing abused
wives say.

06:57.925 --> 07:00.325
Has Shredder been abusing you?
I would never do that.

07:00.365 --> 07:02.685
I clearly wouldn't
be the wife out of me and him, so...

07:02.725 --> 07:05.045
No, you are so the wife.
I'm pretty sure you are, mate.

07:05.085 --> 07:07.605
There's no way I'm the wife.
Yeah, you are, you are, yes.

07:07.645 --> 07:09.965
Put your face away. It's ghastly.
It's worse for me.

07:10.005 --> 07:11.805
Not really, you don't have
to look at it.

07:11.845 --> 07:14.125
Pop it on the table, there's a love.
You want me to?

07:14.165 --> 07:16.525
Pop it. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop. Right, OK.

07:16.565 --> 07:18.765
Oh, my good jove, Shredder,
what are you doing?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.565
I'm eating a banana.
It's a new fruit.

07:20.605 --> 07:22.965
Well now,
that is glorious, isn't it?

07:23.005 --> 07:25.525
Can you get hold of one for me?
Hmm, yeah, sure.

07:27.685 --> 07:31.285
Maybe I got you wrong, Shredder.
Maybe you are the wife after all.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.325
Ha.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.765
It'll be like a slumber party.

07:39.805 --> 07:42.805
Having you in my bed is not a party
and I doubt I'll get to slumber.

07:42.845 --> 07:44.845
Of course you will.
I'll help you slumber.

07:44.885 --> 07:46.605
Just think of me as
a big teddy bear.

07:46.645 --> 07:49.765
A big naked teddy bear with herpes.

07:49.805 --> 07:52.125
Oh, one or two nights?
Max, two nights max.

07:52.565 --> 07:56.485
Wow, that's come up a treat, hasn't
it? I'm not sure it's a treat, but...

07:56.605 --> 07:58.245
Well, it is for me.
I feel awful.

07:58.285 --> 08:00.725
It was my fault you got duffed up
in the first place.

08:00.765 --> 08:03.005
He didn't duff me up.
He just caught me by surprise.

08:03.045 --> 08:06.165
Several times. Yeah, they're pretty
stealthy these 90-year-olds?

08:06.205 --> 08:07.805
What? You said 70.
Cynth said 90.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.925
Yeah, well he wasn't.
Yeah, well we don't know.

08:09.965 --> 08:12.765
All right, Mets, leave him alone,
he's a poor lamb.

08:12.805 --> 08:16.245
I'm really not a poor lamb.
I just feel bad that Cynthia
missed her audition.

08:16.285 --> 08:18.925
Oh, don't worry, I managed
to re-arrange it for tomorrow.

08:18.965 --> 08:20.725
Oh, cool, I'll come with you.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.685
OK, great. Maybe wait outside
just because of the whole...

08:23.725 --> 08:25.725
Yeah, will do.

08:27.285 --> 08:29.285
Oi, oi.

08:33.085 --> 08:35.405
I guess I could make my move
on her tonight.

08:35.804 --> 08:37.765
Just sleepwalk into my old room
and be like,

08:37.804 --> 08:39.804
'Oh, sorry, Irina, force of habit.'

08:39.845 --> 08:43.405
I don't think force of habit is
a valid excuse for sexual assault.

08:43.445 --> 08:47.405
Yeah. She'll probably just
invite me in anyway. Dirty minx.

08:51.805 --> 08:53.485
Where is she? She's here, right?

08:53.525 --> 08:55.205
Oh, yeah. And then some.

08:55.245 --> 08:56.965
How's my breath?

08:57.005 --> 08:58.565
Ooh! Hot and bananary.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.205
Perfect.

09:00.245 --> 09:02.245
Boys! Here she is.
You are home.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.045
Oh, hi.

09:07.085 --> 09:09.085
Wow.

09:09.885 --> 09:11.445
Really?

09:11.485 --> 09:13.205
Hello!

09:13.245 --> 09:14.845
Oh. Yeah.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.925
Erm, what?
This is my husband, Cosmo.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.365
Your... Husband.
Cosmo!

09:21.405 --> 09:23.365
Ah, no.

09:23.405 --> 09:28.605
Great to meet you. We're
going to have such fun time, huh?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.925
Two nights max!

09:40.765 --> 09:42.565
It might take a bit longer.
Oh, you think?

09:42.605 --> 09:44.405
This wasn't part
of your fantasy, then?

09:44.445 --> 09:47.125
The sexy new flatmate has
a massive pony-tailed husband?

09:47.165 --> 09:50.845
Not really. It's bonkers
our landlord
never mentioned him, innit?

09:50.885 --> 09:53.805
Really bonkers, Grumio.
Really battleship mental.

09:54.085 --> 09:56.085
Oh, come on, mate. Hurry up.

10:02.365 --> 10:04.365
Oh, I think
this might be the finale.

10:10.005 --> 10:12.005
Hmm, might be doing an encore.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.125
- Oh, oh!
- Ohhhh!

10:27.024 --> 10:30.764
All right?
Pony tail is in there. Oh, God.

10:30.832 --> 10:32.632
I'm next.
Oh, no, swap with me.

10:32.714 --> 10:35.274
No, thanks. Well, yes, thanks,
Grumio. You're my slave.

10:35.314 --> 10:37.434
I didn't sleep,
so please swap with me.

10:37.754 --> 10:40.154
Why didn't you sleep?
Because of you, mate.

10:40.314 --> 10:42.554
What do you mean?
I'm an ideal bedfellow.

10:42.994 --> 10:44.994
Are you?
Yeah.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.234
Do you know you napsterbate?
I do what now?

10:48.274 --> 10:50.274
You napsterbate. You sleep wank.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.714
Shut up!
No-one's ever mentioned it before.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.874
No-one's ever hung around
to find out.

10:56.754 --> 10:58.514
Did I get to the end?

10:58.554 --> 11:00.154
I didn't watch.

11:00.194 --> 11:02.194
You did, yeah.

11:02.394 --> 11:04.394
Ha, morning!
All right.

11:05.114 --> 11:06.994
I have left anus cloth next to sink.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.034
Right, cool.
What's an anus cloth?

11:09.474 --> 11:11.474
Do you mean my face flannel?

11:11.834 --> 11:14.674
Have a nice day. I'd leave
that for a bit if I were you.

11:16.714 --> 11:18.714
OK, you can go first.

11:21.674 --> 11:24.674
I had no idea there was a husband.
Well, I think you did.

11:24.754 --> 11:26.954
I think you lead us into
a honey trap. How dare you.

11:26.994 --> 11:29.754
I did no such thing.
You said Thracian women were dirty.

11:29.794 --> 11:32.234
They are very dirty, but
also very faithful.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.474
That's a terrible combination.

11:34.514 --> 11:36.714
Not for the Thracian blokes.
They bloody love it.

11:36.754 --> 11:38.394
We want the Thracians
out of our flat.

11:38.434 --> 11:40.834
They're noisy and they leave
their fruit everywhere.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.114
Ah, now you're being Thracist.
What? No, I'm not.

11:43.154 --> 11:45.154
No, I'm not having Thracism
in my building.

11:45.194 --> 11:47.514
Those guys have suffered.
They've been invaded.

11:47.754 --> 11:50.474
And now we've been invaded.
Exactly. Serves us right.

11:50.514 --> 11:53.834
The bottom line is, lads, you
wanted her, you keep her. And him.

11:53.874 --> 11:56.154
Yeah, but for how long?
You said this was temporary.

11:56.194 --> 11:58.314
Well, that depends
on their banana business.

11:58.354 --> 12:00.554
I mean, if it takes off then
so will they.

12:05.074 --> 12:06.794
Off you go, then.

12:06.834 --> 12:10.154
Ahem! Introducing bananae.

12:10.194 --> 12:17.834
The hip new yellow fruit snack
that gives you energy and friends.

12:17.874 --> 12:19.874
Ooh, does it?
Yeah.

12:19.954 --> 12:24.074
This hand-held superfood

12:24.114 --> 12:29.794
is this season's must eat
for all thrillseeking execs.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.754
Ask Stylax for them now.

12:31.794 --> 12:35.394
Ah. You realise I can't put
out an advertisement as a memo.

12:35.434 --> 12:37.274
It's not an advertisement.

12:37.314 --> 12:38.874
I'm afraid it is

12:38.914 --> 12:41.314
if you're telling people to
ask Stylax for them now.

12:41.354 --> 12:44.794
OK. What about if we put
a question mark at the end?

12:44.834 --> 12:49.034
So it was like, 'Ask Stylax
for them now?'

12:49.674 --> 12:52.154
Oh, yes, all right.

12:52.194 --> 12:54.234
Would you not like to
mention their shape?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.274
Ah... no.

12:56.874 --> 12:58.874
No, you're all right.

13:02.794 --> 13:04.794
We meet at last.

13:05.514 --> 13:07.114
Shredder, do you mind?
What's that?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.274
I don't want you looking
at me when I'm eating it.

13:09.314 --> 13:11.914
Oh, right, shall I?
No, stay. Just turn around.

13:18.474 --> 13:21.314
You have to peel it.
I know, I know you have to peel it.

13:27.314 --> 13:30.754
They're high in energy
and, erm, yellow.

13:30.794 --> 13:32.794
Sssh!

13:42.994 --> 13:44.994
Do you like them?
Yes.

13:45.794 --> 13:47.794
Yes, I do.

13:47.954 --> 13:49.954
So, maybe if you order some more in.

13:50.154 --> 13:54.394
Oh, I will. This is exactly what
the workforce need to defeat
the mid-afternoon slump.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.034
Oh, big time.
Shredder?

13:56.074 --> 13:58.074
What?
Can you get me a shed load more?

14:03.194 --> 14:04.994
Don't take it personally.

14:05.034 --> 14:08.114
I don't. It's just dispiriting
that so many auditions are fixed.

14:08.154 --> 14:11.474
By fixed you mean someone
else gets the part? Yeah, exactly.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.194
Help our brave boys.

14:13.234 --> 14:15.234
Oh, Marcus, there he is.
Oh, shit.

14:16.034 --> 14:19.074
Him? What? That frail old man there?
He's deceptive sprightly.

14:19.114 --> 14:20.834
Can we just go please
before he sees us?

14:20.874 --> 14:24.074
He won't see us. He's probably
got cataracts if he's
in his eighties.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.754
He's late sixties tops.
Help our boys, sweetheart?

14:26.794 --> 14:29.514
I think I've already
helped quite enough, thank you.

14:29.554 --> 14:31.754
Do you mind if I ask you
how old you are, please?

14:31.794 --> 14:33.794
I'm too old for you, darling.
I'm 79.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.114
He's basically 80.
Seventies. He's in his seventies.

14:37.154 --> 14:39.994
Help our brave boys abroad, sir?
Just get out my face, yeah.

14:40.034 --> 14:43.234
Oh, it's you. Oh, that's come up
nice and shiny, hasn't it?

14:43.394 --> 14:45.394
Yeah, just piss off, you knob.

14:46.154 --> 14:48.194
Oh, so you're a tough guy now,
are you?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.154
Ignore him, Marcus, just walk away.

14:50.194 --> 14:52.514
Yeah, that's right, Marcus.
Jog on, mate.

14:58.634 --> 15:01.554
You got something to say, have you?
You little pussy.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.114
Ohhh!

15:04.154 --> 15:05.794
What the hell
did you do that for?

15:05.834 --> 15:07.594
He's an old man,
you bloody psychopath.

15:07.634 --> 15:10.234
He called me a pussy and you
were teasing me the whole time.

15:10.274 --> 15:11.874
So it's OK to deck him?

15:11.914 --> 15:15.634
Oh, I'm pathetic for being beaten up
by an old man but I'm
a monster for beating him up?

15:15.674 --> 15:19.074
What am I supposed to do?
Neither. You're meant to do neither.

15:20.394 --> 15:22.394
Ah, come on.

15:26.394 --> 15:29.394
Ah, man, that's even less cool.
I know. It went down really badly.

15:29.434 --> 15:32.234
Clearly the only thing worse
than being attacked by an old man

15:32.274 --> 15:34.034
is attacking an old man.

15:34.074 --> 15:36.754
Well, so what am I meant to do
if he really wants to fight me?

15:36.794 --> 15:38.474
You just wait it out.
Just wait it out?

15:38.514 --> 15:41.314
What, until he dies? Yeah,
that's what you do. You outlive him.

15:41.354 --> 15:44.674
I'm not even sure I would, mate.
He was so fucking sprightly.

15:45.834 --> 15:48.754
Well, tonight why don't
we try sleeping top and tail?

15:48.954 --> 15:51.114
I'm not worried about your
top or your tail.

15:51.154 --> 15:53.154
It's that area there.
Oi!

15:54.154 --> 15:56.154
Hello.
Hiya.

16:09.154 --> 16:11.074
Is this our flat?

16:11.114 --> 16:12.714
Get off me.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.794
Grumio, why does our flat look
like a community centre?

16:15.834 --> 16:17.914
They invited some more
Thracians round.

16:17.954 --> 16:20.954
They were all right at first,
then it all got a bit much.

16:21.194 --> 16:23.194
I'll say. It's bloody heaving.

16:23.554 --> 16:25.794
Stylax, come here.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.834
Come meet my sister Eva.

16:30.434 --> 16:32.194
This is my sister Eva.

16:32.234 --> 16:34.114
Hello.
Hiya. My name's Stylax.

16:34.154 --> 16:35.834
Yeah.

16:35.874 --> 16:37.874
And her husband Gregor.

16:38.994 --> 16:40.994
Right, yeah.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.994
Sorry, Cosmo. Yeah?
What's this?

16:45.034 --> 16:46.674
We have get-together.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.714
Well, can I...
I've got some food I wanna cook.

16:48.754 --> 16:51.194
No, no. No space in kitchen.
But we have food.

16:51.354 --> 16:53.154
What have you got?

16:53.194 --> 16:57.034
Banana fritter, banana cakes, a
Thracian dish called galvinta, hmm.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.234
What's galvinta?
Secret recipe.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.394
Banana-based?
Yes.

17:03.394 --> 17:05.394
This my friend Carlotta.

17:05.434 --> 17:07.434
Hey.
Hi. I'm Stylax.

17:07.954 --> 17:09.513
Pleased to meet you.

17:09.554 --> 17:11.233
And her husband Angelos.

17:11.273 --> 17:13.273
Yep, thought so.

17:15.794 --> 17:17.794
Mushroom. Mushroom, over here.

17:17.874 --> 17:19.714
What does that mean?
For wrestling.

17:19.753 --> 17:22.314
They keep trying to get me
to wrestle that slippery lad.

17:22.354 --> 17:24.354
Come on, Mushroom,
he's only boy.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.314
And calling me Mushroom.

17:26.354 --> 17:29.194
And this is my cousin Petra.
Her husband passed away recently.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.274
OK, cool.
Stylax. Lovely to meet you.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.674
So she cannot touch a man
for one year.

17:33.714 --> 17:35.114
Yep, obviously.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.154
Mushroom, Mushroom, Mushroom!

17:38.034 --> 17:39.874
- Oh, look.
- Mushroom! Mushroom!

17:39.914 --> 17:42.914
Look at the Mushroom.
Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom!

17:44.354 --> 17:50.514
Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom!

18:10.834 --> 18:13.434
You really should be able
to take a 10-year-old boy, Grumio.

18:13.474 --> 18:16.394
There's no way that beast were 10.
He were at least 12.

18:18.234 --> 18:19.994
I can't live like this.

18:20.034 --> 18:21.634
These people are awful.

18:21.674 --> 18:24.434
I'm not being Thracist. I just
really want them out of my flat.

18:24.474 --> 18:26.154
Yeah, they'll be gone soon.

18:26.194 --> 18:29.474
A couple more big banana orders
from work and they're out of
here. Two days.

18:29.514 --> 18:31.354
Don't say it. Don't say anything.

18:31.394 --> 18:34.394
Don't speak to me ever again.
This is a new fucking low.

18:39.154 --> 18:41.154
Oh, bloody hell. What's he doing?

18:42.754 --> 18:44.714
Mate, no! This isn't the toilet.

18:44.754 --> 18:46.754
Hello, Mushroom.

18:49.994 --> 18:51.994
Two days max.

19:06.154 --> 19:08.154
Water?

19:10.234 --> 19:12.074
Water?

19:12.114 --> 19:14.114
Oh, fuck!

19:14.154 --> 19:16.154
Aghh!

19:16.874 --> 19:19.194
The banana jacket
is an accident waiting to happen.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.794
Except it's already happened.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.234
Right. OK, it's an accident
waiting to happen again.

19:23.274 --> 19:25.514
Can you not just
look where you're going, water boy?

19:25.554 --> 19:27.434
Not if I'm carrying
the jug, no. Water man!

19:27.474 --> 19:29.714
These things are a health
and safety nightmare.

19:29.754 --> 19:32.594
He just doesn't like them because
they're shaped like a penis.

19:32.634 --> 19:34.754
It is not that actually.
It isn't that actually.

19:34.794 --> 19:38.914
I insist you ban them or I will tell
head office you're putting
the safety of the staff at risk.

19:38.954 --> 19:40.954
I will.
Fine, have it your way.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.154
No, wait.
As of now, I am banning bananae.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.394
They are bananned.
Do not bring them into the office.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.474
Now get out.

19:49.514 --> 19:51.514
Thank you for your time.

19:52.474 --> 19:54.474
But they're so tasty and hip.

19:54.754 --> 19:56.714
The deal is off, Shredder,
I'm banning them.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.074
Immediately after I've had
this last one.

20:05.314 --> 20:08.314
So that's that, then. We're
basically stuck with these fuckers.

20:08.354 --> 20:10.554
Looks like it. But you know,
it'll get better.

20:10.594 --> 20:12.354
Oh, it won't.
Of course it will.

20:12.394 --> 20:14.874
After a time we'll adapt
to their ways and customs

20:14.914 --> 20:17.514
and maybe even meet
some single Thracian women

20:17.634 --> 20:19.434
who can be filthy and loyal to us.

20:19.474 --> 20:21.474
Make way!

20:22.194 --> 20:23.794
Shit, get down.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.834
Down.
Halt!

20:27.074 --> 20:29.074
On me.

20:39.474 --> 20:41.474
Does Marcus Gallow live here?

20:42.154 --> 20:43.914
What do you want him for?

20:43.954 --> 20:46.994
The evil bastard attacked
a veteran, put him in hospital.

20:47.034 --> 20:49.034
Any idea where he is?

20:49.474 --> 20:51.474
Oh, yeah, he's right in here.

20:52.594 --> 20:54.314
He's that one with the pony tail.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.234
Thank you.

20:56.274 --> 20:58.274
Come on, boys.

21:01.754 --> 21:04.194
These big oldies
all come barrelling in,

21:04.234 --> 21:07.274
then one of them, like, flung him
about by his pony tail.

21:07.994 --> 21:09.594
What was Irina doing?

21:09.634 --> 21:12.074
She was sort of squealing,
but not like before.

21:12.114 --> 21:15.194
This were less sexy, more angry.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.114
And then they just left?

21:17.154 --> 21:19.474
Just packed their bags
and buggered off. Awesome.

21:19.514 --> 21:22.394
Is it awesome, though, that
we had an innocent guy beaten up?

21:22.434 --> 21:24.434
Yeah. He was really annoying.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.114
I'm not sure that's enough.
Yeah, with all the kissing.

21:27.154 --> 21:29.674
And the wrestling.
Did you see the size of his shits?

21:29.714 --> 21:31.354
They were bigger than me.

21:31.394 --> 21:33.234
I suppose it will be nice
to have my bed back

21:33.274 --> 21:35.714
without the herpes-ridden
teddy bear wanking in it.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.754
There you go.
This couldn't be any better.

21:37.794 --> 21:39.834
Oh, they didn't leave any bananae,
did they?

21:39.874 --> 21:43.074
No, sorry. But I did find
this under the bed.

21:45.874 --> 21:48.114
What the hell is that?
