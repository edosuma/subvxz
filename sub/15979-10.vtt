WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:05.039
Hey, Dad, you were in
charge of putting away

00:05.073 --> 00:06.540
the Christmas lights
last year, right?

00:09.077 --> 00:11.679
Don't worry. I put a chocolate
in the middle to motivate you.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.414
Dark or milk?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.516
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna get it.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.151
Relax, everybody.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.420
I found it.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.123
My star for the top of the tree.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.192
Oh, thank goodness.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.095
It just wouldn't be Christmas
without you shining down on us.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.529
Where was it?

00:28.562 --> 00:29.697
You know, Mom, great question.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.698
It was weird.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.367
It wasn't with the rest
of the Christmas stuff.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.503
Oh, gosh, that is weird.
Yeah.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.305
Luckily, I saw that some dust
had been disturbed

00:37.338 --> 00:38.639
behind the water heater.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.108
And when I shimmied
up the crawlspace,

00:40.141 --> 00:41.642
I found it in a box marked
"Dangerous chemicals,

00:41.675 --> 00:44.212
may cause wrinkles."

00:44.245 --> 00:47.181
(laughs)
So weird.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.683
Wow, this is amazing!

00:49.717 --> 00:51.652
I did not know
they had color photography

00:51.685 --> 00:53.221
back when you were a kid.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.856
Don't you have your own family
you could be annoying?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.291
Don't you have some noise hair
that needs trimming?

00:57.325 --> 00:58.626
Rhetorical question.
I can see it from here.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.760
It looks like speaker wire.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.662
And FYI--

01:01.695 --> 01:03.097
my family takes
a cruise every Christmas

01:03.131 --> 01:04.865
and I can't go on account

01:04.898 --> 01:07.568
of my clinically diagnosed
seasickness.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.141
Well, I'm sorry, Kip.
I didn't know.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.110
I'm taking everyone
on a cruise.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.279
Boys, boys, stop it!

01:18.312 --> 01:19.880
If I wanted to see
two grown men fight,

01:19.913 --> 01:23.117
I'd wear my red dress
and go to a bar.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.686
You've been at each other's
throats since the day you met.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.888
So this year, the only gift
I want for Christmas

01:27.921 --> 01:30.524
is for the two of you to stop
fighting until New Year's.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.792
Can you do that for me?

01:31.825 --> 01:33.361
Yes, Mom.
Yes, Carol.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.196
Thank you.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.798
And in case you misunderstood,
I still want real gifts.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.733
There's a Lane Bryant catalog

01:39.767 --> 01:41.869
underneath both your pillows.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.738
(laughs)
I told you I'd get it.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.608
(electrical humming)

01:50.311 --> 01:52.213
Does this mean when
Christmas is over

01:52.246 --> 01:54.648
we can just leave him at
the end of the driveway?

02:23.277 --> 02:25.679
Damn. That's not it either.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.780
What are you doing
over there, Dad?

02:26.814 --> 02:27.815
Trying to remember

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
my e-mail password.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.385
I forgot I even had this account

02:31.419 --> 02:34.488
till the guy at the grocery
store called me a yahoo.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.427
Oh, good,
you're all still here.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.495
As you know, it's
our family's turn this year

02:41.529 --> 02:43.864
to put on the living Nativity
at church.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.233
Last year, the Muellers raised

02:45.266 --> 02:46.467
over a thousand dollars
for charity.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
And in the true sprit
of Christmas,

02:48.536 --> 02:50.471
I want the Millers
to destroy them.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.806
Listen up for your parts.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.208
Debbie, shepherd one.

02:54.242 --> 02:54.975
Adam, shepherd two.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.577
Ha-ha, I'm your boss.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.246
Mikayla, you'll be a sheep.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.847
Ha-ha, I'm your boss.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.916
And I will continue to play
the role of the Virgin Mary.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.718
But now that Tom and I
are divorced,

03:04.752 --> 03:05.953
I no longer have to suffer

03:05.986 --> 03:07.521
through his silent,
but deadly nights

03:07.555 --> 03:11.459
and will have a new man
by my side in the Nativity.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.962
This year's Joseph
will be played by...

03:14.995 --> 03:17.231
Nathan!

03:19.032 --> 03:21.335
Oh, uh, wonderful choice,
wonderful.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.971
That is why I'm standing.
No other reason.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.306
Kip, Kip.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.341
You and Tom will be
the wise men.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.609
Meeting adjourned.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.611
Wait, wait... uh, Mom?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.546
Do I have to be at the Nativity
every night this week?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.448
I mean, Ray and I got invited

03:34.482 --> 03:36.817
to an ugly Christmas sweater
party by this girl Nikki.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.752
Spelled with two K's and an I.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.455
Yes, she's that kind of girl.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.324
No, you don't have to be there.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.259
I'll just tell them
Mary got a divorce

03:45.293 --> 03:48.028
and Joseph's seeing
other virgins.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.298
Fine, I'll be there.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.334
I know the password was
something I used to hear

03:53.367 --> 03:54.435
all the time!

03:54.468 --> 03:55.669
I've tried my pet's name,

03:55.703 --> 03:57.438
all the kids' names,
the street we lived on.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.273
Oh, shut up, Tom.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.674
"Shut up, Tom."

04:00.708 --> 04:01.909
That's it!

04:03.511 --> 04:08.782
16,352 new messages.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.784
Holy Christmas.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.487
I've got mail.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.790
Did you hear how off-key

04:16.824 --> 04:19.560
Mrs. Mueller was
on that last song?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.829
More like "Bark
the Herald Angels Sing."

04:21.862 --> 04:23.864
Heard you the first
three times you said it.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.799
Well, how about
a little courtesy chuckle.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.535
Not every joke is a home run.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.370
Oh, Reverend Fitzgerald, hi!

04:29.403 --> 04:31.939
You remember
my son, Nathan.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.675
The most profitable
baby Jesus in church history.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.610
Oh, yes.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.878
How could I forget

04:37.911 --> 04:40.681
when you so generously
donated a plaque

04:40.714 --> 04:41.649
commemorating the event.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.787
We are just so thrilled
to be doing the Nativity

04:46.820 --> 04:48.856
again this year...
WOMAN: * Hark! the herald

04:48.889 --> 04:50.558
* Angels sing

04:50.591 --> 04:53.761
* Glory to the
newborn king *

04:53.794 --> 04:56.897
* Who is my grandson.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.533
He's such a beautiful boy.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.403
Oh, look at that.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.973
He's got your eyebrow.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.875
Well, Mom, careful.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.976
It's like a school zone.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.111
Sins are doubled in church.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.781
Well, it's just a shame
that it's the Millers' year

05:13.814 --> 05:15.583
to do the Nativity
when we all know

05:15.616 --> 05:18.586
that nothing brings in
the real cash like

05:18.619 --> 05:20.087
a real baby.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.924
It's true. Real babies do
tend to raise more money.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.626
I'm sure I could dig up a baby.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.794
I mean, not "dig up,"
but, you know,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.929
get one from somewhere fast.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.498
Is she talking about kidnapping?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.400
No. Is she?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.435
No. Are you?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.003
No.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.406
Ah. Well...

05:38.439 --> 05:39.873
maybe it would
be best if we let

05:39.907 --> 05:41.475
the Muellers do the
Nativity this year.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.143
(stammering)
But we're the ones...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.446
Ooh, that's probably best.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.148
My little one is too cute

05:48.181 --> 05:51.619
not to be adored this season.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.521
Well, he is cute.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.523
He's got a little
Tom Selleck in him.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.959
Especially that mustache
stretched across his forehead.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.969
Dad, are you still going
through those old e-mails?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.538
I'm not even halfway through.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.772
You would not believe
how many people

06:11.805 --> 06:14.442
think I have
erectile dysfunction.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.810
Well, they're not
too discriminating.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.946
I get those e-mails, too.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.716
I can't believe
Lucille Mueller trumped us

06:22.750 --> 06:24.485
by having a grandbaby.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.953
Or should I say "grand man"?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.721
That thing looks like it's about

06:27.755 --> 06:30.057
to go out and fight Popeye.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.192
It does look like
a caterpillar crawled

06:32.225 --> 06:36.029
across his face and just
gave up halfway through.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.098
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
But on the bright side,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.733
maybe there will be
a baby next year,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.702
because Adam and I have
been doing it a lot.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.970
Like, pretty much every day.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.572
We're really
in a zone right now.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.442
How do you unsay things?

06:48.476 --> 06:50.911
We can't give up.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.013
If we give up on the Nativity,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.115
we might as well
give up on Christmas.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.850
And we can't do that
because I got us

06:56.884 --> 07:00.488
Oprah's favorite frozen
croissants for Christmas morn.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.590
Spoiler alert--
you get a croissant!

07:02.623 --> 07:03.957
And I get a croissant!

07:03.991 --> 07:07.160
And that's it because
they're too expensive.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.897
Oh, it's pointless, Kip.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.933
Reverend Fitzgerald already gave
the Nativity to the Muellers.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.068
Well, then we take
a baseball bat to their knees.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.773
No? All right, I'm just taking
the temperature of the room.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.075
A second option is

07:22.109 --> 07:23.611
we set up our own
rival Nativity scene

07:23.644 --> 07:25.746
in that empty lot
next to the church.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.848
Ooh, going rogue.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.149
Like this spunky Sarah Palin

07:29.182 --> 07:32.085
I just donated
campaign money to.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.021
Come on, one trip
to the hardware store,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.989
and bam-- there's your manger.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.190
And Nativity costumes are easy.

07:37.224 --> 07:40.861
You already have a closet
full of stolen hotel bathrobes.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.863
That's all they wore
in Bible days.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.533
Jerusalem looked
like one big day spa.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.001
Well, thank you, Kip.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.970
Even though it's not wrapped,
I'm guessing your gift

07:50.003 --> 07:53.541
to our family this year is
the worst idea I've ever heard.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.544
Huh, it's almost
like someone thinks

07:56.577 --> 08:00.013
his mother's happiness
isn't worth fighting for.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.716
Huh, it's almost
like someone thinks he's part

08:02.750 --> 08:05.619
of this family and has
a say in what we do.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.888
Huh!

08:07.921 --> 08:08.922
It's almost like
someone's pretending

08:08.956 --> 08:10.824
he doesn't have veneers.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.527
Huh!
Enough!

08:13.561 --> 08:15.829
You guys promised me
you'd stop fighting.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.899
Mom, I'm fine being in
a sanctioned manger by a church,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.669
but I refuse to be some
basically homeless Joseph

08:21.702 --> 08:24.538
wandering around looking
for someplace to stay.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.575
Although, yes, I admit that does
sound like the actual Joseph.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.543
But... the point is
I'm not doing it.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.745
Because, I'm sorry, Kip,
it's a dumb idea.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.146
So, you're just
gonna have to find

08:33.180 --> 08:34.582
someone else to play Joseph.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.688
Well, I might know someone
who would qualify for the job.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.957
You're right.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.860
Kip!

08:46.894 --> 08:48.161
Who's Kip?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.898
I only answer to Joseph!

08:50.931 --> 08:51.899
Ah-ha! This is so exciting.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.568
Ooh! We're gonna make
the best manger ever.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.036
Okay, I'm gonna go
home and shower

08:56.069 --> 08:57.304
before I hit The Home Depot.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.072
There's so many hot guys
there on the weekends,

08:59.106 --> 09:00.808
they should call that
place The Homo Depot.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.076
And before you laugh,
just know I'm the only one

09:03.110 --> 09:05.613
who can make and
laugh at that joke.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.083
Thank you for
understanding.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.924
Ow.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.327
God, my legs are cramping up.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.762
Told you not to choose

09:21.795 --> 09:24.865
such a difficult pose.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.601
Hey, just on our way
to Nikki's party.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.738
Thought you guys might want
some spiked eggnog, but...

09:30.771 --> 09:32.172
Ray drank it all.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.774
That was spiked?

09:33.807 --> 09:36.744
I just thought eggnog made
everyone look prettier.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.245
(smacking)
What's up, Debbie?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.682
Yeah, we, uh, we would've
been here sooner,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.050
but, uh, we got
caught in the crowd

09:43.083 --> 09:44.384
at that Nativity
down the street.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.154
A scalper tried to sell
me seats so close

09:47.187 --> 09:49.222
I could pet a donkey.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.958
But contrary to
popular belief,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.060
I am not an ass man.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
(laughing)

09:57.197 --> 10:00.300
(whoops)

10:00.333 --> 10:02.936
Well, we don't need eggnog

10:02.970 --> 10:04.738
because there was no eggnog

10:04.772 --> 10:07.708
back in biblical times,
and we're being authentic.

10:07.741 --> 10:11.244
Please, you guys look like
you just escaped a motel fire.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.346
Plus, come on,
you've made no money.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.148
Look, Mom, maybe
it's time to admit

10:15.182 --> 10:17.384
that not every idea
Kip has is brilliant, okay?

10:17.417 --> 10:19.887
And until then, tell Dad
to close his robe a little.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.189
Not everyone wants
to see his yule log.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
Maybe Nathan's right.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.829
We can't compete with
the Muellers' Nativity.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.698
Let's just pack it up.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.034
Wha...? So you're
just gonna give up?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.136
It's Christmas!

10:36.169 --> 10:38.672
Did little Kevin give into
the burglars in Home Alone?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.009
Did sweet Ralphie
give up on his dream

10:42.042 --> 10:44.678
of a BB gun
in A Christmas Story.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.280
Did Detective Irwin walk away

10:47.314 --> 10:49.382
from his infected,
but quite an attractive wife

10:49.416 --> 10:51.819
in Silent Night, Zombie Night?

10:51.852 --> 10:53.887
All right.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.288
Apparently I am the only one
who saw that movie.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.724
But I am not leaving!

10:56.757 --> 10:58.692
Yeah, but the Muellers
have all the costumes

10:58.726 --> 10:59.960
and a real baby and props.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.862
We don't have anything.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.064
You know what, Debbie?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.365
You know what we do have?

11:05.398 --> 11:06.399
A little something called razz.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.268
Okay?

11:08.301 --> 11:09.436
You know what else we got?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.138
Matazz.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.405
And you know what you get

11:12.439 --> 11:14.141
when you put
those two things together?

11:14.174 --> 11:17.110
Matazz-arazz?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.146
Razzamatazz!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.447
Come on, you guys.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.648
I promise you,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.484
I will lead us in a performance
that will get us a crowd.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.786
Are you with me?!

11:25.819 --> 11:28.055
Yes!

11:28.088 --> 11:29.489
Sorry, were you
saying something?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.726
I just found out I stand to
inherit a crap load of money

11:32.760 --> 11:34.962
from a very powerful Nigerian.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.971
Okay, guys, let's run the ending
one last time, okay?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.039
Here we go.
Five, six, seven and...

11:46.073 --> 11:49.877
* Sleep in heavenly peace...

11:49.910 --> 11:52.412
Okay, okay, yeah,
somebody's off, and it's not me.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.814
(laughs)

11:53.847 --> 11:56.116
Have you seen
this Elf Yourself thing?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.450
Someone just e-mailed it to me

11:57.484 --> 11:59.787
six years ago.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.898
That's all my old friends
from college dancing.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.432
They can't dance!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.767
They're all dead now.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.235
(chuckles)

12:15.268 --> 12:18.105
(clears throat)
How it be, my ladies?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.173
Oh, look at the two of you.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.408
Ray and I are going

12:21.441 --> 12:23.176
to a Christmas Pimps
and Ho-Ho-Hos party.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.413
Just stopped by to get some
of Dad's cheap cologne.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.949
You're in luck. I just refilled
my jug at the kiosk.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.084
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.786
Dress like a pimp,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.287
walk like a pimp.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.923
There you go.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.892
Walk like your knees
are on backwards.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.962
Mom?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.997
Mom?

12:46.466 --> 12:49.436
Did you buy and decorate a tree
without me?

12:49.469 --> 12:52.572
Sorry, you were at your party,
and I didn't think you'd care.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.207
I was feeling a little down,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.209
and when we drove past
the Christmas tree lot,

12:56.243 --> 12:58.511
Kip suggested buying one
might cheer us all up.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.413
Wait.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.949
Where's my star?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.984
(sighs)
Kip had an accident.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.053
He didn't mean to, Nathan.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.055
He just pulled it
out of the box too fast,

13:08.088 --> 13:10.290
and-and the point
was ripped off.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.325
(gasps)
We did everything

13:12.359 --> 13:14.061
we could to repair it,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.263
but it was old,

13:16.296 --> 13:18.999
and it had lost
a lot of glitter.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.067
But don't worry,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.101
because I made a replacement.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.135
Look. There it is.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.536
Ta-da.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.174
Wait, this-this has everyone
but me in it.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.241
No, no, no, no.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.376
You're in it.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.911
See? Your mom opened her locket

13:30.944 --> 13:32.179
that has your picture.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.546
Oh, wait,
there's a piece of glitter

13:33.580 --> 13:34.915
covering it.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.016
Oh, there you are.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.718
You know what?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.888
We could just take
another one...
Oh, gosh, look at that time!

13:40.921 --> 13:42.022
We got to run!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.523
I made dinner reservations

13:43.556 --> 13:44.591
at Carol's favorite place.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.625
Come on, everybody.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.194
We need to carbo-load

13:47.227 --> 13:49.062
before the big Nativity show
tonight.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.497
(chuckles)

13:50.530 --> 13:52.399
My treat!

13:56.569 --> 13:57.905
Ray, do you see
what's happening here?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.506
That I'm about to sweat
through my mink.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.607
Come on, man!

14:00.640 --> 14:02.075
It's hot in here for a pimp.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.210
(scoffs)

14:03.243 --> 14:04.644
Kip is trying to steal my mom.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.347
I mean, first
he-he-he ruined my star,

14:07.380 --> 14:09.616
the he swooped in and took
Joseph first chance he got.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.152
Now he's taking them to dinner,
and he's paying for it?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.453
That's my thing.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.922
I'm the one who pays for dinner

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
and doesn't make
a big deal out of it.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.125
This year alone
I've already done it, like...

14:18.158 --> 14:20.127
17 times.
Yes, exactly.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.930
This has been Kip's play
all along.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.564
Won't be long
before he's sitting in my place

14:24.597 --> 14:26.399
at the dinner table,
trying to glue his ugly face

14:26.433 --> 14:28.201
over my baby pictures.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.237
I got to stop this guy.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.639
Well, fine!

14:32.672 --> 14:34.874
I guess I'll just walk
to the party.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.650
Ah.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.653
Man, I'm gonna be late.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.925
Okay, places, everyone.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.493
Adam, plug in the lights.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.529
Remember,
tonight is a brand-new night.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.333
Okay, and just like Mary
forgot the excruciating pain

15:00.367 --> 15:03.236
of a drug-free
barnyard childbirth,

15:03.270 --> 15:06.706
we are gonna forget
the excruciating pain

15:06.739 --> 15:09.176
of last night's
low turnout, okay?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.643
Are we all ready?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.012
Here we go.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.313
Happy birthday to me.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.714
(screams)

15:14.747 --> 15:16.716
Nathan, that looks great.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.685
Who's Nathan? I'm Baby J.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.220
Nice to meet you.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.455
Baby J. This is hilarious.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.992
Look exactly like me
when I was a baby.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.527
It's true.
I've seen the pictures.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.597
Nathan, we have a plan,
and you're not part of it.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.067
And you're too sun-damaged
to be a newborn.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.602
Hey, listen,
I'd watch your temper

15:35.635 --> 15:37.304
in front of the crowd, Joseph.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.538
Oh, nice try.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.606
What crowd?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.108
Oh, hark, there is a crowd.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.575
Sweet Jesus.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.444
No, I mean it;
that's a sweet Jesus.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.114
Oh, hey, do you mind if I take
a picture with your funny Jesus?

15:47.147 --> 15:49.049
Actually,
if you make a donation,

15:49.082 --> 15:50.717
we'll take the picture for you.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.020
The line starts right over here.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.588
Oh, Kip, run home
and get my Polaroid camera.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.057
It's in my bathroom.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.992
Never mind why.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.094
But we're supposed
to sing a song.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.362
Who cares about a song?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.696
We'll make a fortune
for the church

16:03.730 --> 16:06.066
selling photos
like mall Santas do.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.200
Why can't Nathan go?

16:07.234 --> 16:08.335
I can't go.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.436
I'm swaddled.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.671
Fine.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.174
Drive safe, Kip.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.643
I'll be praying for you.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.185
(crowd chattering)

16:25.218 --> 16:27.187
Everybody calm down.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.455
Joseph's coming back
with the camera.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.259
You'll all get a turn to take
your official photo with Baby J.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.127
KIP:
Excuse me, excuse me.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.163
Better Baby Jesus
coming through here.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.630
Excuse me.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.466
Better Baby J. Excuse me.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.500
Excuse me. (grunts)

16:40.533 --> 16:41.634
There we are.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.637
Kip, what the hell
are you doing?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.107
Well, the baby's good,
but the song is better,

16:47.140 --> 16:49.309
but since you can't sing,
I made myself a baby costume.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.711
Yeah, well, we've
already got a baby: me.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.813
I'm the big-headed Baby Jesus
that people want.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
Well, you got the
big-headed part right.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.418
Burn. (sizzles)

16:58.451 --> 16:59.652
I'm leaving.
I don't like seeing

16:59.686 --> 17:01.154
my savior arguing
with himself.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.222
No, no, don't go.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.192
These two Jesuses made
a Christmas promise to me,

17:05.225 --> 17:07.660
and they are going
to stop fighting now.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.096
Look, if you don't get
the heck out of here,

17:09.129 --> 17:09.996
I'm gonna kick your ass so hard

17:10.029 --> 17:11.264
you're gonna be wearing
a diaper for real.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.699
Oh, I'm so scared.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.167
Oh.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.335
You don't believe me?

17:15.368 --> 17:16.736
I don't. Hey, back off.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.238
No, you back off.
You back off. Stop it.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.442
Ouch.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.117
I asked for one thing
for Christmas.

17:30.150 --> 17:30.983
One thing.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.320
And now because
of your stupid fighting,

17:33.353 --> 17:37.257
Lucille Mueller is home,
stroking her eyebrow in victory.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.859
It was his fault.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.727
My fault?!
Yeah.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.728
You just couldn't stand
the fact that

17:41.761 --> 17:43.730
I was getting so much attention
as Baby Jesus.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.799
In the manger I busted my
butt to build for Carol.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.601
You think I like
building mangers?

17:48.635 --> 17:52.272
No, but I had to because her son
was too buy going to parties.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.706
You think I like going
to parties?!

17:53.740 --> 17:56.276
No, but I had to if I'm gonna
give her the grandchild

17:56.309 --> 17:58.245
she so desperately wants.
And I lied.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.112
I do like going to parties.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.747
Yeah, well, I like
building mangers.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.282
And I can get her a grandson.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.684
There are a lot of options
for men these days.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.253
No, I'm her son.
It's different.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.487
We share the same blood.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.888
Yeah, well, I'm her roommate.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.022
We share
the same value-sized bottle

18:10.056 --> 18:13.260
of Pantene Damage Detox
Deep Cleanse Purifying Shampoo!

18:13.293 --> 18:14.794
You don't deserve her!
Neither do you!

18:14.827 --> 18:16.196
Boys!

18:16.229 --> 18:17.264
Boys.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.400
Is this what
you've been fighting about?

18:20.433 --> 18:21.901
Me?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.636
You two have been acting
like complete fools

18:23.670 --> 18:25.572
all because of some
silly competition

18:25.605 --> 18:26.739
over me?

18:29.442 --> 18:32.345
Please continue.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.182
You're actually enjoying this?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.216
Are you kidding?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.751
I thought you guys
just didn't like each other,

18:38.785 --> 18:41.221
but now I know that the two
most important men in my life

18:41.254 --> 18:42.755
were fighting for my affection?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.358
That is the greatest gift
a mother/roommate

18:45.392 --> 18:46.926
could ever hope for.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.228
Go ahead!

18:48.261 --> 18:50.697
Mix it up, boys.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.799
Well, this is...

18:52.832 --> 18:54.567
this is just weird now.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.336
I know.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.870
You, uh,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.239
want to go get some eggnog?

18:59.272 --> 19:00.340
Yeah, why not?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.574
Oh, come on!

19:01.608 --> 19:02.842
Don't give up!

19:02.875 --> 19:04.611
Kip, he doesn't
appreciate me enough

19:04.644 --> 19:06.279
after all I've done for him.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.780
Nathan, who does Kip
think he is,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.849
trying to get
in between a mother and her son?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.352
Has she always been
this kooky?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.220
No, it's getting worse.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.688
You picked a great time
to move in, bud.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.357
Oh, come on!

19:17.390 --> 19:19.326
It's Christmas!

19:19.359 --> 19:21.361
Fight.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.669
Why do we have
to do this?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.703
Because we're not quitting

19:30.737 --> 19:33.240
until we get more donations
than the Muellers.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.708
I got the costumes. Let's go.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.409
Well, this better work.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.478
Trust me, I've seen this before.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.513
It's gonna blow people away.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.552
(sleigh bells ringing)

19:45.585 --> 19:46.586
KIP:
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.821
(electronic version
of "Jingle Bells" begins)

20:14.814 --> 20:16.816
*

20:40.072 --> 20:42.275
*

20:46.479 --> 20:48.481
Merry Christmas!
