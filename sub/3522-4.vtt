09:49.021 --> 09:50.022

to worry me.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.524
Not even

09:51.524 --> 09:53.526
That's got

It's horrible.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.529

10:47.079 --> 10:48.581
I'm sad

Eat your monigott'.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.594

i was upstairs,

11:06.098 --> 11:09.101
i heard the door
and then his voice,
"i'm home."

11:09.101 --> 11:12.104
I fucking wanted
to vomit.

11:12.104 --> 11:15.608
After all that worrying
he might be dead,

11:15.608 --> 11:17.610
praying
he was okay.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.613
My heart just sank,
i wished--

11:20.613 --> 11:23.115
he had died.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.117
Oh.

11:25.117 --> 11:30.122
To just come and go
year after year like that.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.124
How dare he!

11:32.124 --> 11:34.126
Have you reached
out to him?

11:34.126 --> 11:36.128
That's a good one.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.632
Listen,

11:39.632 --> 11:42.635
and i don't want
my kids to know this.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.137
They found a lump
under my arm.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.139
Oh my god.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.141

11:51.644 --> 11:55.147
he said,"jesus christ",

11:55.147 --> 11:59.151
Then he went back
to doin' whatever
the fuck he was doin'.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.654
Spraying wd- 40
on his pocket knife.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.156

12:04.156 --> 12:08.661
Touch my face, or something

You know what

24:07.379 --> 24:10.882
Well if the trip

shrimp hors d'oeuvres
on the plane.

Get some immodium.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.439

27:09.561 --> 27:11.563
and really, you're n
ot missing all that much.

27:11.563 --> 27:15.066
The amount
of sexual harassment
that i was subjected to.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.068
I went one tim
e with my friend zane.

27:17.068 --> 27:19.070
Her, they
didn't bother,

27:19.070 --> 27:21.072
me, they couldn't keep
their hands to themselves.

27:21.072 --> 27:24.075
Much less the whistlin
g and the fucking hooting.

27:24.075 --> 27:25.076
It's not italy.

27:25.076 --> 27:28.079
Do you remember
angie bonpensiero?

27:28.079 --> 27:31.082
Angie belfiore

27:31.082 --> 27:33.585
Right, she's thinking
of divorcing him.

27:33.585 --> 27:34.586
Halle- fucking- lujeh!

27:34.586 --> 27:36.588
Do you
know them?

27:36.588 --> 27:38.590
No i don't know them
, but to be married
to a man like that.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.091
A man
like what?

27:40.091 --> 27:42.093
The'tude and the fucking
medieval outlook.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.095
He is such an adoring
father though.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.598
Three beautiful kids
they raised,

27:46.598 --> 27:48.600
who are now from
a broken home.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.102
Ilk
no sons i hope,
three more of his

27:51.603 --> 27:52.604
we don't need.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.605
He's very macho.

27:53.605 --> 27:57.108
Macho, no, try
swaggering mama's boy,

27:57.108 --> 27:58.109
fucking hypocrites,

27:58.109 --> 27:59.110
Hypocrites?

27:59.611 --> 28:01.613
Carm, come on stop.
Just stop.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.114
Is that how you

28:03.114 --> 28:05.617
I thought we wer
e talking about angie.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.120
I mean these o
. c. pricks especially,

28:09.120 --> 28:12.624
with their goomahs
and their prostitutes,
emotional cripples.

28:12.624 --> 28:16.628
And they expec
t their wives to live

28:16.628 --> 28:18.630
like the fucking n
uns at mt. Carmel college.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.131
It's not
that simple.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.633
Of course not.

28:21.633 --> 28:25.136
Madonna/whores is the full
equation i believe.

28:25.637 --> 28:30.642
Clothes,
appliances, houses.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.143
You are
talking about me.

28:32.644 --> 28:33.645
About us.

28:33.645 --> 28:34.646
No.

28:39.150 --> 28:44.155
ce,
that a woman
of your intelligen

28:44.155 --> 28:47.158
is content to ask so littl
e from life and from herself.

28:47.659 --> 28:51.663
I don't know, it's none
of my business.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.165
Marriage is
a holy sacrament.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.667
Ay.
Ok

28:56.167 --> 28:57.669
family is
a sacred institution.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.671
Roger.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.172
And you trying
to fan the flames

29:01.673 --> 29:03.174
with richie aprile,
of all people?

29:03.174 --> 29:04.676
Talk about
old school.

29:05.176 --> 29:08.680
Carm, richie, because of h
is life experience in prison,

29:08.680 --> 29:11.182
he has a sensitivity
to the plight of women.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.684
Oh my god!

29:12.684 --> 29:16.187
I am not even
gonna touch that one.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.190
But you had me going
for a while there,
you really did.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.193
Oh janice honey,
i got to love ya.

30:03.234 --> 30:04.269
Nice shot.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.238
I shank him.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.741
It's
a man's club.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.243
I'll send you
one your size.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.245
Whole set.

30:14.245 --> 30:21.753
So tony, you don't mind
me calling you tony?

30:21.753 --> 30:25.757
What can
i do for you?

30:25.757 --> 30:28.259
Well you can introduce
me to the boss.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.761
You ca
n talk to me.

30:29.761 --> 30:33.264
A fuckin'
woman boss?

30:33.765 --> 30:35.767
So what
do you want?

30:36.267 --> 30:37.769
Never happen
in the states.

30:38.269 --> 30:39.771
Never.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.272
Our men ki
ll each other.

30:41.272 --> 30:47.779
All my brothers, for example,
they all got murdered.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.781
Or they
go to prison.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.783
Rome has a war
against us.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.285
But our men are
in love to their mama.

30:54.285 --> 30:57.789
So being a woman is not--
come se dic',

30:57.789 --> 30:59.290
comes natural.

30:59.290 --> 31:02.794
We'll i'll
be dipped in shit.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.299
You go around like your
father's nursemaid.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.301
I am my father's
nursemaid.

31:10.301 --> 31:14.305
Well if an old man carries
the respect of troops,

31:14.806 --> 31:15.807
you keep
him around.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.809
I did something
like that myself.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.310
We're cousins.

31:23.815 --> 31:24.315
You hungry?

31:24.315 --> 31:27.819
I could eat.

31:38.830 --> 31:42.333
So, you wanted
to talk about business.

31:42.333 --> 31:46.337
Can i ask
you a question?

31:46.838 --> 31:49.841
We not gonna pay
the price on the mercedes.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.844
Why do you save your
toenail clippings?

31:52.844 --> 31:57.849
Why, you
want them?

32:02.854 --> 32:05.857
Il,
if your enemy comes
into possession of your na

32:05.857 --> 32:09.360
or your hair clippings,
they can make the evil on you.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.864
I'm flattered you wouldn't
trust me with your toenails,

32:12.864 --> 32:14.866
but can i pass without
ruining the moment?

32:14.866 --> 32:17.869
I alread
y burned them.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.370
Em.
Nobody gets th

32:43.895 --> 32:45.897
commendatori.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.900
Bon giorno.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.405
Cocksuckers.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.414
A lot of guys today,
they come soft
living in america.

33:03.414 --> 33:05.416
One in five guys,
they're a fucking rat.

33:05.416 --> 33:09.921
You can't find anybody
over there that believes
in the old ways,

33:09.921 --> 33:12.423
keeping silent,
putting the family first.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.926
Ys.
So you want
naples' gu

33:15.426 --> 33:18.429

guys with no ties
to anybody over there

33:22.934 --> 33:25.436
they belong only to me,
110 percent.

33:26.437 --> 33:27.939
What?

33:27.939 --> 33:29.440
What do i get?

33:29.941 --> 33:33.945
Well, you get an obvious
advantage to havin'
your guys in that end.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.446
How much you
pay me for this man?

33:35.446 --> 33:36.447
Pay you?

33:36.447 --> 33:38.950
Your profitability
is gonna go way up.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.453
What are
you thinking?

33:42.453 --> 33:44.956
Furio to start.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.458
Furio!

33:47.458 --> 33:49.460
Back up,
take it easy.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.462
I'm going to give yo
u one of my best men.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.464
And all i get is a bunch
of numbers in air.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.967
With all due
respect,

33:56.467 --> 33:57.468
i think you're being
a little short- sighted
on this.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.971
He's my cousin,
he's one of my best men.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.472
Forget about it,
it's not going
to happen.

34:01.472 --> 34:02.473
I'm asking
you nice.

34:02.974 --> 34:03.975
Or what?

34:03.975 --> 34:06.477
Hey look, i don't even
think you understand.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.478
I want you to talk
to your husband about this.

34:08.980 --> 34:09.981
My husband

36:35.626 --> 36:37.128

36:55.146 --> 36:58.149
Yeah, come

36:58.149 --> 37:00.151
Jesus christ, is that
all your people do?

37:00.151 --> 37:01.652
The lunch we had
would jam a wood chipper.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.654
We need to finish
our business.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.656
I said all
i'm gonna say.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.162
Alright,

38:23.234 --> 38:26.237
My father was born
in this house.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.741
Later we m
ake the new one.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.747
You're born here,
and your kids
are raised next door.

38:38.249 --> 38:42.253
That's
a nice thing.

38:46.257 --> 38:48.259
You take good care
of your father.

39:23.294 --> 39:28.299

with until he goes
to sleep.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.301
I'll take you
back in the morning.

39:38.809 --> 39:40.311
Goodnight.

39:59.330 --> 40:00.831
It was horrible
what he did.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.833
I might as well
have fucking cancer.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.838
So what did
the lawyer say today?

40:07.838 --> 40:09.840

40:09.840 --> 40:12.343
So your gonna take monda

Oh.

40:14.845 --> 40:15.846
I'm finished

40:16.347 --> 40:18.349
Hell, i thought myself
into fuckin' nonexistence.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.351
Well, you ar

40:25.356 --> 40:28.359
God gave me
more years, carmela.

40:28.359 --> 40:31.862
This very morning
god gave me a gift,

40:31.862 --> 40:33.864
and i will
use that gift.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.366
I won't
waste it,

40:35.366 --> 40:38.369
like i wasted
24 fucking years
with this man.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.371
You know wha
t the church say
s about divorce.

40:40.871 --> 40:43.374
Oh please, let
the pope live with him.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.887
Well, what about
the kids?

40:56.887 --> 40:59.390
Up.
They're 19, 21, and 24,
it's time we all grew

40:59.890 --> 41:03.394
kevin is just
starting his sophomore
year at college.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.396
Aren't you worried
he's gonna realize,

41:05.396 --> 41:07.398
the two stayed together
waiting for him to leave?

41:07.398 --> 41:08.899
Long as he don't
loose his privileges

41:08.899 --> 41:09.900
at our house down
the shore,

41:09.900 --> 41:11.402
that's all kevin
cares about.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.904
He's so fond of his father,
that's all i'm saying.

41:14.405 --> 41:18.909
And terry and scott
with the money problems,

41:18.909 --> 41:20.411
and the pregnancy,

41:20.411 --> 41:23.414
this is really the example
you want to set,

41:23.414 --> 41:24.915
when your daughter
is struggling very hard

41:24.915 --> 41:26.417
to keep her new marriage
in one piece?

41:26.917 --> 41:28.419
Why you workin
' this hard, carmela?

41:28.419 --> 41:29.920
Why?

41:29.920 --> 41:31.922
For all of the reasons
i just said.

41:31.922 --> 41:36.427
Because you're my friend,
i'm not even sayin' don't.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.429
I'm just sayin'
at the very least,

41:38.429 --> 41:40.431
you got to ask
yourself these questions.

41:40.431 --> 41:43.934
Terri, they're not even sure
she's gonna be able

41:43.934 --> 41:45.436
to have children
of her own.

41:45.436 --> 41:49.940
Sal began to cry
when he heard that.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.445
Oh, honey.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.952
In the end, i know
you're not gonna leave him.

42:02.453 --> 42:05.956
I know you
won't do that.

42:15.966 --> 42:17.968
Commendatori

mer is always right.

43:39.550 --> 43:42.553

43:48.058 --> 43:53.063
You know my grandfather
was napoletan',
gran- pappa mio.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.566
He went to america
in 1910.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.067
Three thousand
miles.

43:57.568 --> 44:02.072
Un ragazzo, un piccolo bambino,
all by himself.

44:02.072 --> 44:06.076
Yep, i'm napoletan'.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.578

44:25.095 --> 44:28.599
Ariani el pino

44:28.599 --> 44:33.103

44:33.604 --> 44:35.105

44:35.105 --> 44:38.108

44:38.609 --> 44:41.612
Our families probably
knew each other.

44:59.630 --> 45:02.633
The island back there
is called progeda.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.639
Is.
Madonn',

45:12.142 --> 45:13.644

45:19.149 --> 45:22.653
In the olden tim
e the sibylla of cumae

45:22.653 --> 45:25.656
was the second most
important oracle
after delphi.

45:25.656 --> 45:28.158
I thought delphi
was in greece.

45:28.158 --> 45:29.660
The gree
ks were here.

45:29.660 --> 45:33.163
Way before the romans,
and before the greeks

45:33.163 --> 45:37.167
there were somebody else,
and before them somebody else.

45:37.167 --> 45:42.673
"The rulers would
come from across
the ancient world,

45:42.673 --> 45:44.174
"to hear the sibyl's
predictions of the future.

45:44.675 --> 45:47.678
She would sit inside
the cave inhaling gases."

45:47.678 --> 45:50.180
I think
i dated this broad.

45:50.681 --> 45:53.684
"Possibly volcanic
though no longer active,

45:53.684 --> 45:55.686
"and would speak
in a voice not her own,

45:55.686 --> 45:58.689
delivering unto them
their fates."

46:02.192 --> 46:04.695
Let's go
into the cave.

46:20.210 --> 46:23.213
The sibyl sat way back there,
see that shaft of light?

46:23.213 --> 46:26.717
Some
fucking trip.

46:26.717 --> 46:33.724
The sibyl were
very beautiful,
in most case.

46:33.724 --> 46:36.727
Oh yeah, got
a premonition for me?

46:36.727 --> 46:42.733
You, you're no
problem to read.

46:42.733 --> 46:45.235
You are your
own worst enemy.

46:45.235 --> 46:46.236
Oh, is that right?

46:46.236 --> 46:49.740
Tell you right now
you remind me

46:49.740 --> 46:51.742
of somebody
from back home.

46:51.742 --> 46:56.246
Not your wife,
your girlfriend?

46:56.246 --> 46:59.249
Oh, i got one,
to answer your question.

46:59.249 --> 47:03.253
But no,
not her.

47:03.253 --> 47:05.255
But, she's someone
you want to fuck.

47:08.258 --> 47:09.760
I can tell.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.262
Oh really.

47:12.763 --> 47:17.768
You know, everybody's
their own worst enemy.

47:17.768 --> 47:21.271
So maybe your
psychic power has been
overrated a little bit.

47:21.772 --> 47:23.774
You don't want
to fuck her?

47:31.281 --> 47:32.783
You don't want
to fuck me?

47:32.783 --> 47:34.785
Yeah, i do.

47:34.785 --> 47:38.789
But i don't shit
where i eat.

47:38.789 --> 47:43.794
Que cosa?

47:43.794 --> 47:47.297
Non fare
la merdo dove...

47:47.297 --> 47:53.804

ree buying a gift for ade.

district in the world.
