WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:04.171
Got it.
All right.

00:04.304 --> 00:06.273
Okay, let's go in.
I'm freezing.
People, wait, wait, wait.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.638
Come back, come back.
One fun one.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.006
We're gonna do a fun one.
Okay.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.773
One <i>Charlie's Angels.</i>
One. Let's go.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.872
Okay,
this is just a Christmas card
from your paper supplier.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.109
No one's putting
this on their fridge.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.243
I got it, you guys,
how about this.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.547
Michael, what if all the boys
are on one side,

00:20.721 --> 00:21.916
all the girls
are on the other.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.254
The boys are, like,
"Why, I ought to..."

00:24.358 --> 00:26.657
And the girls are, like,
"Let's go shopping."

00:27.461 --> 00:29.157
Let's just jump in the air.
That's it!

00:29.263 --> 00:30.856
That's a picture!
Yes! Jump in the air.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.229
We're gonna jump in the air.
Here we go.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.326
Okay, one, two, three.

00:36.737 --> 00:37.761
Not everyone jumped.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.433
Okay, everybody jump
in the air this time, please.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.565
Here we go.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.270
One, two, three.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.242
Still some people not jumping.
You gotta be kidding me.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.248
Who isn't jumping?
I'll tell you who.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.944
Darryl, Phyllis,
Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.042
I am jumping.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.815
You are?
Let me see you jump.
Yes, I'm jumping.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.286
Oh, my God. This is
a store-bought camera.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.189
This isn't one of those
special military-grade cameras

00:59.259 --> 01:00.420
that would be
able to capture that.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.553
I'm freezing.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.688
Also, Erin is
jumping way too early.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.958
She's on the ground
by "three."

01:05.032 --> 01:06.125
I didn't want to miss it.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.100
Well, if we all jump
really high,

01:08.168 --> 01:09.796
we'll be in the air longer.
Do that.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.361
Here's a question
nobody's asking,

01:11.438 --> 01:12.838
is this worth it?
Don't answer that.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.374
People,
listen up and listen good.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.535
We need to just
get one picture

01:16.610 --> 01:18.636
where we're all in the air
at the same time. Yes?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.010
Why?
I believe in us.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.173
We can do this.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.217
Okay, on three,
everyone in the air.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.746
Three, two, one, zero.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.880
Just say "jump."
Say the word "jump."

01:30.390 --> 01:31.585
We didn't get it.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.751 --> 01:59.549
<i>I'm the office</i>
<i>administrator now,</i>

02:00.053 --> 02:01.954
which means I'm
basically being paid

02:02.022 --> 02:03.991
to be head of the
party planning committee.

02:04.257 --> 02:07.056
The first thing I did
as head, I shut it down.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.723
<i>At its worst it was</i>
<i>a toxic political club</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.996
<i>used to make others feel</i>
<i>miserable and left out.</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:18.033
At its best
it planned parties.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.934
It hardly looks fake.
It's so lush.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.270
Why does it smell real?

02:24.177 --> 02:25.167
JIM: Ah!

02:25.879 --> 02:26.869
Good one.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.809
Ho, ho, ho!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.650
Merry Christmas,
little children!

02:34.721 --> 02:35.780
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

02:35.856 --> 02:38.519
How's everybody doing today?
PAM: Good.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.126
How's the party coming along?
Great.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.460
Are we over budget?
Nope.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.699
No? Good.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.429
Did anyone
get drunk already?

02:48.535 --> 02:50.697
Not yet.
Good for you.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.605
Angela, lay it on me,
what's the problem?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.467
Nothing. Should be fun.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.104
So, Stanley,
how big is the bug
up your butt today?

02:59.212 --> 03:02.011
Pam got those
sugar-free cookies I like.
I'm doing fine.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.744
All right, well,
I will be in my office

03:05.819 --> 03:08.345
making toys for
the good children.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.056
Andy?
Yeah?

03:11.224 --> 03:12.658
What you got?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.253
It's all good, Santa.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.724
Well, that's a relief.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.095
Santa's gonna take
some much-needed free time.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.729
All right. Good!

03:20.801 --> 03:22.736
MICHAEL: <i>My kids</i>
<i>are growing up.</i>

03:22.936 --> 03:25.701
<i>As a boss, I look at that</i>
<i>and I say, "Great."</i>

03:25.772 --> 03:29.607
It is exactly what a boss
would hope would happen

03:29.676 --> 03:31.235
because that's what I want.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.280
That's what
every boss wants,

03:33.346 --> 03:36.908
is a wonderful Christmas
with no drama.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.051
It's present time, you guys.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.262
Happy holidays from
your friends at Sabre.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.456
We just want to say
how grateful we are.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.692
Sabre is actively looking
for ways to involve me

03:52.766 --> 03:54.735
as minority executive trainee.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.099
So I suggested choosing
the annual Christmas gift
to the employees.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.140
And they said,
"Oh, yes. Perfect.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.302
"Thank you, Kelly. Finally,
something for you to do."

04:04.111 --> 04:06.239
It's a Hello Kitty
laptop sleeve.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.679
Hello Kitty's for girls.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.409
Nashua got mp3 players.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.145
Yeah, I don't even
have a laptop.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.881
I wonder if these
presents would be under
as much scrutiny

04:13.954 --> 04:15.388
if I were white.
WOMAN: Wow.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.980
Come on.
I said "I wonder."

04:17.057 --> 04:18.649
I didn't say "I think."

04:18.791 --> 04:21.226
Kelly, I thought we agreed
on fleece blankets.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.054
Blankets?
What am I, five?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.929
Erin and I make
great use of ours.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.625
Yes, Erin and I
are still dating.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.965
Why do you ask me so often
if we're still dating?

04:32.339 --> 04:34.831
I'll take one of
those pink pouches.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.771
I feel good today.
My little girl Jada?

04:37.844 --> 04:40.404
It's my turn to have her
for Christmas this year.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.143
Two years ago I had her,
and we had the best time.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.650
I've TiVoed her
favorite shows,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.253
some things
I've never heard of.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.886
<i>iCarly...</i>

04:48.622 --> 04:50.648
You know who's funny
on that show?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.190
The friend with
the video camera.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.391
He's got a nice
way of talking.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.529
Hey, it's snowing.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.296
DWIGHT: Oh, my God!

05:03.370 --> 05:06.067
It's the first snowfall
of Christmas.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.072
Is that just so magical
for you, little girl?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.804
Can you not wait to
have a hot chocolate,

05:10.877 --> 05:14.439
and cuddle up with Papa
and tell him about all
your Christmas dreams?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.207
It's not even a real snow.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.684
Look, it's a dusting.
It's pitiful.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.128
Hey, Dwight.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.057
MEREDITH: Yes!

05:34.568 --> 05:37.060
Damn it, Jim,
you cannot throw
snowballs in here!

05:37.337 --> 05:40.933
Well, it's not a snowball,
'cause it's only a dusting.
Right?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.533
Look at that.
There's a pebble in there.
You could have killed me!

05:43.610 --> 05:45.010
Don't be such a baby.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.774
Yeah,
who's a little girl now?

05:50.617 --> 05:52.051
You apologize to me
right now.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.313
You've got something
on your nose.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.082
You apologize right now.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.154
No.
Very well,

05:57.457 --> 05:59.688
then I challenge you
to a snowball fight

05:59.893 --> 06:02.124
on the first
real snow of winter.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.027
You got it.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.864
That sounds awesome.
Can we all do it?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.665
No, Andy,
it's a snowball fight.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.203
It's not fun.
Go get your own thing.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.464
Beat it.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.440
Jim, let go.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.378
Angela, are you bringing
your new boyfriend
to the party?

06:28.755 --> 06:30.348
I wouldn't subject
Robert to that.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.415
He's a very busy senator.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.755
State senator.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.728
I would not expect you
to know what it's like

06:36.796 --> 06:38.196
to date someone in
the public arena.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.561
Who are you dating
in the public arena?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.360
The senator.
Oh, right.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.732
The state senator.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.832
We went to a picnic thrown
by the comptroller's wife.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.672
Oh.
That would be impressive

06:51.745 --> 06:55.113
if anyone knew what
a comptroller was.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.678
Well...

06:57.918 --> 07:00.615
Do you have any idea
how many photographers
there are

07:00.687 --> 07:02.519
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.115
I do. Two.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.122
"Angela...
Over here."

07:07.193 --> 07:09.856
"Angela... Here.
Look here!"

07:10.497 --> 07:13.296
Before we kick off the party,
I just want to remind everyone

07:13.366 --> 07:15.358
that an office party
is just that...

07:15.435 --> 07:16.630
Yeah!
A party.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.098
It's not an excuse
to get really drunk

07:19.172 --> 07:22.301
or confront someone
or have a cathartic experience

07:22.375 --> 07:23.707
of any kind.
MICHAEL: Pam?

07:23.810 --> 07:25.301
Pam?
Pam?

07:25.545 --> 07:27.844
Wow, there are questions
to that. Okay.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.940
You know what,
no questions.

07:31.017 --> 07:34.613
Last item on the agenda,
Toby would like to
make an announcement.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.315
Hi, guys.
Hi.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.383
I just wanted to
let you know

07:40.460 --> 07:42.258
that I'll be taking
a leave of absence
starting next week.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.558
Because you've
been on the lam?

07:44.197 --> 07:45.859
Because the boring police
have been after you,

07:45.932 --> 07:46.922
and they finally
caught up with you?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.057
No, the opposite.

07:48.134 --> 07:52.333
I was actually selected
to be a juror on a very
high-profile case.

07:52.405 --> 07:57.002
Yes, the case of the
horrible red-headed sad sack.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.305
And the verdict, it was Toby.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.247
And the sentence, death.
Death to Toby!

08:02.682 --> 08:03.741
DWIGHT: Death to Toby!

08:03.817 --> 08:05.809
Okay, that's hurtful talk.
We've talked about that.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.615
You know, I don't interrupt
your announcements.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.986
You leave these huge pauses
in your sentences.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.115
What do you expect me to do?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.420
What's the case, Toby?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.585
Well, I really can't
talk about it,

08:13.660 --> 08:14.855
but it's a very
high-profile case.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.362
Is it criminal?
Yes.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.997
Have we heard of it?
I don't know.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.726
Is it the middle school
teacher who tried

08:19.799 --> 08:21.700
to turn her foreign exchange
student into a sex slave?

08:21.768 --> 08:23.703
Come on.
Was it the post office guy

08:23.770 --> 08:25.136
who rubbed his penis
all over the mail?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.333
Guys,
it's a really big deal.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.308
He's rubbing his neck.
He's rubbing his neck!

08:29.376 --> 08:30.469
He's rubbing his neck.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.703
Scranton Strangler!

08:33.113 --> 08:34.910
I can neither
confirm nor deny this.

08:34.981 --> 08:38.179
Let's just say
I'll be up to my neck
in jury duty.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.818
That was the worst joke ever.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.689
Corporate will be
sending someone else
to take my place.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.285
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.057
Holly Flax.
She comes from
the Nashua branch.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.428
What? What?
Yeah.

08:51.598 --> 08:52.588
She'll be starting next week.

08:52.665 --> 08:53.792
If you have any
questions about

08:53.867 --> 08:54.926
the transition,
just let me know.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.560
Hold on,
Holly's coming back here?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.332
Yeah.
Guys, who's Holly?

08:58.505 --> 09:00.269
MICHAEL: That is a great
question, Erin.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.368
How do you describe somebody
who is at the same time

09:04.978 --> 09:07.846
an old friend,
and was a lover.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.781
And was a complicated part
of my past,

09:12.852 --> 09:14.787
and maybe, just maybe

09:14.854 --> 09:16.379
a part of my future?
Wow.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.788
She's one sassy black lady.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.157
Holly's coming back,
everybody, and we have to
have a party.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.957
I'm not sure
the temporary replacement

09:23.029 --> 09:24.691
of an HR rep
really warrants a party.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.563
You know what,
we'll postpone this party
until then.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.100
This is too important.
Cancel this one.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.196
Dwight, get rid of the tree.
Okay.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.738
Cancel. We're canceling it.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.797
No, don't throw them out!

09:34.941 --> 09:35.931
No, we have to
cancel the party.

09:36.009 --> 09:36.999
We can save that!
No, no, no.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.909
We're gonna get
fresh for Holly.
Fresh and new.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.207
I know.
These cookies are fine!

09:40.280 --> 09:42.613
It's not. They're not.
Michael, wait.

09:42.682 --> 09:43.843
We don't have...

09:43.917 --> 09:45.909
We don't have the budget
for another party.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.920
Well, then,
everybody will chip in.
It'll be fine.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.855
I honestly think
you're idealizing people
here again, Michael.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.358
I don't think
that's gonna happen.
You know what,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.360
I'll pay for it.
I'll pay for the party.
It doesn't matter.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.158
This is way too important.
People, Holly's coming back,

09:57.297 --> 09:59.596
and this is the most
important Christmas party
of my life.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.430
So back to work.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.097
Man, I worked hard.
I worked so hard for this!

10:05.572 --> 10:07.973
I was after
corporate constantly.

10:08.074 --> 10:11.067
I emailed Jo.
I wrote letters.

10:11.144 --> 10:15.343
And you know who
I end up owing this to,
is the Scranton Strangler.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.874
Thank you. Thank you,
Scranton Strangler.
I love you!

10:19.352 --> 10:22.254
You just took one more
person's breath away.

10:28.194 --> 10:32.131
MICHAEL: <i>We have always had</i>
<i>good Christmas parties here,</i>
<i>as you know,</i>

10:32.198 --> 10:33.962
<i>but they've never been cool.</i>

10:35.235 --> 10:37.261
The name is Bond. Santa Bond.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.898
I'll have an eggnog,
shaken, not stirred.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.439
Classic Brosnan.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.871
Santa. Wonderful tradition.
Everybody loves Santa.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.210
Everybody can't get enough
of the jolly old man.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.408
But that is a myth,
because you know what,

10:50.517 --> 10:53.214
he is not necessarily
a big fat guy with a beard.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.911
He's not
necessarily an old guy.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.753
No one knows what
the real Santa Claus... God!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.453
Could you just stop
moving your calves so much
while you're talking?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.257
Well, this year's
gonna be different.
We're gonna have fun.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.194
It's not gonna be tacky.
It's going to be...

11:04.264 --> 11:07.359
You know what,
the food is
going to be austere.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.166
It is not going to be tacky,
deli platter food.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.796
It's not gonna have a big,
fat, gross Santa Claus.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.932
It's gonna be a cool,
sleek Santa.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.508
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.942
Okay. Sure.
I'll invite him.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.172
I mean,
unless there's any chance

11:19.245 --> 11:20.508
there could be press
at this party.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.843
You never know
about the press.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.248
Well, I only ask
because he's a senator.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.785
Could he help us with
some parking tickets?

11:25.852 --> 11:26.945
I don't think
that's appropriate.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.215
Well,
then he's not a senator.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.813
Yes, he is.
Okay.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.187
Hey.
Hey.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.522
We still doing
the gifts today?

11:35.061 --> 11:36.689
I mean,
it is the Christmas party.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.990
Well,
the classy Christmas party.
Yes.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.567
But don't get too excited,
'cause I didn't have
a lot of time this year.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.728
Me neither.
Okay.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.830
I've been working
forever on Jim's present.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.570
He always gives me
the best Christmas gifts.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.611
He'll take a memory
or a private joke,

11:53.680 --> 11:57.208
and he'll create
something totally unique.
I love them.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.878
So this year
I made him something.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.178
A comic book.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.187
It stars Jimmy Halpert,
a mild-mannered paper salesman

12:05.258 --> 12:06.726
who, while riding his bike
through the forest,

12:06.793 --> 12:08.921
is bitten by
a radioactive bear

12:08.995 --> 12:12.193
and becomes "Bear Man."
Wreaks havoc on the office.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.961
It's really good.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.613
Okay.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.223
No, no, no, no!
Fake tree. No!

12:38.291 --> 12:40.419
No, it has the little...
Pam, no, no.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.984
Holly's coming
from New Hampshire.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.690
Somebody from New Hampshire
looks at that and thinks
it's a burning cross.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.257
No, no. I want you to
go and get a real tree.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.194
Take some money. Thank you.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.761
Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.429
Yes, that's me. Come on in.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.902
There's nothing classier
than boring jazz music,

12:59.979 --> 13:01.379
I am here to tell you.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.075
And I made a bit
of a judgment call.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.277
I hired one musician,
because I thought,

13:05.351 --> 13:08.014
"What's better,
to hire an entire quartet
for half an hour,

13:08.087 --> 13:10.079
"or one bassist
for the entire day?"

13:15.662 --> 13:19.258
Hey, any volunteers
to come with me to
go buy a Christmas tree?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.995
I would, but I don't
want to get dirty.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.032
There might be
girls at the party.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.366
Why do you always
think that girls
are gonna be at the party?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.102
No one invited girls.
It's just us.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.635
I will help.
Although my brid, my hybrid,

13:32.779 --> 13:35.146
my Prius hybrid,
won't fit a tree.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.179
Which is ironic,
considering how
many trees it saves

13:38.384 --> 13:39.977
on a daily basis.
KEVIN: Yeah.

13:40.086 --> 13:44.046
I do, however, have a hookup
with a dude who has a pickup.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.216
Do you mean Darryl?
That's a great idea.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.453
I'll ask him.
You know Darryl?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.655
Yeah. He works here.
We all know him.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.995
I should come along,
just 'cause he's my,
you know, he's my hookup.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.123
Cool.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.896
Come on, now, Justine, look.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.034
Listen, look, I've been
planning this, okay?

13:59.105 --> 14:01.665
You cannot do this, Justine.
<i>I'm not doing it!</i>

14:01.741 --> 14:03.573
<i>She told me she wants</i>
<i>to have Christmas here.</i>

14:03.643 --> 14:04.975
She did?
<i>Yes.</i>

14:05.044 --> 14:07.411
<i>She wants to be around</i>
<i>family for Christmas.</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:08.470
DARRYL: <i>I don't know.</i>

14:09.449 --> 14:12.317
I thought I was enough
family for my daughter.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.555
Don't come in, I'm busy.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.157
It's cool, Darryl,
I'm here, too.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.919
Hey, sorry, I really
didn't want to come in.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.790
It's just that we have to
go buy a new Christmas tree,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.853
and we're hoping
we could borrow your truck.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.323
Uh. No.
Come on, it'll be fun.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.527
We could do donuts
in the snow on the way back.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.196
No. Thank you for your
interest in my truck.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.835
Okay. Sorry.
We'll leave you alone.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.639
Hey.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.309
You know what?
I could use
a breath of fresh air.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.280
Let's do it.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.979
When Holly gets here,
I want you to be
very helpful to her.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.217
I've looked her up online.
There's nothing about her.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.690
She's made no impression
on the Internet.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.853
She doesn't need
an Internet presence.
You just know.

14:56.796 --> 14:57.855
Hey.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.159
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:59.298 --> 15:00.561
You're supposed to
be in the courthouse.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.795
We're on recess.
I came for the party.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.496
Hey, everyone.
KEVIN: Hi, Toby.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.832
What does the Strangler
look like?

15:07.006 --> 15:09.339
Is he gorgeous?
He looks gorgeous
in the drawings.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.502
Yeah.
That scowl.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.876
I can't talk about it
or I'll get removed
from the jury.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.040
And then he will come back
here and replace Holly,

15:16.115 --> 15:17.708
so stop asking him questions.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.878
I know people are only
this excited to talk to me

15:19.952 --> 15:21.580
because of the trial.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.656
But they talk to me
for a while,

15:24.724 --> 15:27.421
and maybe people realize
I have something to say.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.631
And then one day,
we're just talking.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.270
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>of Dwight Kurt Schrute.</i>

15:42.341 --> 15:43.434
<i>Please leave...</i>

15:57.757 --> 15:59.123
Stop!

16:05.832 --> 16:08.028
I have no feeling
in my fingers or penis.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.293
But I think it was worth it.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.042
<i>I was laying on the ground,</i>
<i>defenseless,</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:23.480
and he just kept throwing them
until he exhausted himself.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.744
And, then...

16:26.285 --> 16:29.255
"How about icing it?
LOL. Dwight."

16:36.429 --> 16:38.022
Hi.
ERIN: Hello.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.657
Is there any way I can
get a hand with these, please?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.299
I'm really sorry,
I can't help you.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.337
I'm waiting for my boss's
pretty friend to arrive.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.235
MICHAEL: There she is.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.867
Hey.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.904
Erin, would you help her,
for God's sake?

16:51.444 --> 16:54.573
You're Holly!
Of course. Sorry.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.913
Hello.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.747
Well, well, well,

17:00.820 --> 17:03.619
if it isn't Michael Scott.
You old bastard.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.387
Well, I never thought
I'd see your face

17:07.460 --> 17:09.656
around these parts,
you old bastard!

17:09.729 --> 17:12.255
Well, I did show my face
around these parts,
you old bastard.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.867
Why, you're some
sort of wise guy, huh?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.367
I most certainly am.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.459
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk...

17:18.271 --> 17:20.536
D'oh!
Oh, Homey.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.371
Okay. Holly's back.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.839
Hi. Hi.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.346
Oh, huggy monster!

17:30.416 --> 17:32.408
Oh, not the huggy monster!

17:32.485 --> 17:34.181
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

17:34.253 --> 17:35.846
I don't want to die!

17:37.823 --> 17:40.122
Wow. Well, everybody,

17:40.192 --> 17:41.888
you remember Holly.
Hi.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.725
Did you bring us
anything from Nashua?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.331
Oh, yeah.
I brought some maple candy.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.198
But I have to admit,
I got a little hungry
on the drive,

17:49.268 --> 17:50.327
and I ate some of them.

17:50.469 --> 17:51.528
MICHAEL: That's adorable.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.266
Would you put those out?
To throw out?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.570
Or put out, like,
six pieces for everyone?

17:55.641 --> 17:57.200
Oh, it's so nice to be back.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.802
It looks beautiful in here.
Super-classy.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.971
It's like a party
for limousine drivers.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.950
Well, you came on the day
of our Christmas party.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.418
It's fabulous.
I love what you did!

18:07.486 --> 18:08.784
Isn't it wonderful?

18:08.854 --> 18:11.050
We love it here.
Don't you love it?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.422
All right, let me show you
to your desk.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.552
I show you to your desk!

18:15.628 --> 18:17.893
HOLLY:
Watch out for my guns.
They're both loaded.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.025
What kind of guns
do you have? Six-shooter?

18:22.768 --> 18:25.431
This is weird. I can't
believe you're here.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.904
This feels like you
never left. Doesn't it?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.439
Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.343
Oh, God.
Oh, and you have a Woody.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.048
Oh, I love...
A.J. gave me that.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.616
Well, that's understandable.
Still raw.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.785
Woody your favorite character?
Mmm-hmm.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.758
You know who my
favorite character
in <i>Toy Story</i> is?

18:46.826 --> 18:48.454
Andy's mom.
Why?

18:48.527 --> 18:50.189
Because without Andy's mom,
there's no plot.

18:50.262 --> 18:52.356
And without any plot,
there is no movie.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.965
That is a really good point.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.061
A.J. said he hadn't seen
any of the <i>Toy Story</i> movies.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.729
You're kidding me.
No. I know.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.899
I'm like, "What?
Are you serious?"

19:01.974 --> 19:03.840
What a douche bag!
Get a life!

19:04.076 --> 19:06.204
Get a...
Yeah, good riddance.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.039
We sat down and we
watched them all in one day.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.141
Now he's the biggest
<i>Toy Story</i> fanatic ever.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.446
Good for him.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.282
Next day I found him
in my bed.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.720
Really? That's creepy.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.223
How did A.J.
get in your house?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.859
We live together.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.522
Oh, you do?

19:22.662 --> 19:26.690
He had a little note
pinned to him that said,
"You've got a friend in me."

19:31.270 --> 19:34.240
Yeah,
Randy Newman's the best.
Yeah.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.571
I love him.
Me, too.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.941
<i>Christmas tree, Christmas tree</i>

19:41.047 --> 19:44.074
<i>Won't you be my</i>
<i>Christmas tree?</i>

19:44.150 --> 19:45.618
Hey, how about this one?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.180
Ah! Seems a little
full of itself, right?

19:48.254 --> 19:49.278
Kind of a pretty boy.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.454
What if we got
a really beat up one,
like on <i>Charlie Brown,</i>

19:52.558 --> 19:54.151
and we just loved
it for what it is?

19:54.226 --> 19:55.250
Maybe. I mean...

19:55.327 --> 19:57.796
No, she be talking
to your mom or something.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.889
This is my
daughter too, Justine!

20:00.700 --> 20:02.100
You seem to think...

20:05.471 --> 20:07.531
Pick a damn tree already.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.707
Hey, listen, Darryl,
it's none of my business,

20:10.776 --> 20:14.269
but if I couldn't
have Cece for Christmas,
I'd be really upset, too.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.612
I don't have kids
or anything,

20:18.417 --> 20:21.717
but if my
grandmother ever dies,
I'm going to kill myself.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.589
Jada don't want to
spend Christmas with me.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.317
She told her mom it
wasn't as much fun.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.190
How could she say that?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.197
You know,
I took her to the toy store
to buy her own presents.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.898
Well, Darryl, no kid
wants to buy their own
Christmas presents.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.397
Her mom wants me
to take her to mass.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.665
I guess that's
something to do.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.175
No, you should have
her mom do the boring
Christmas stuff on her time.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.472
You should be associated
with the fun parts
of Christmas.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.110
How do I do that?

20:46.345 --> 20:47.938
Bring her to the party.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.710
Yeah, we'll have Santa,
and we'll play games with her.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.615
It'll be a lot of fun.
Yes!

20:52.718 --> 20:55.517
You'll be Mr. Christmas
by the end of the night.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.749
Hey, guys, the tree's here.
Hey.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.292
Nobody hug me.
I'm covered in tree sap, so...

21:02.361 --> 21:04.523
Why would someone hug you?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.759
Hey there, Jada.
Nice to see you again.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.267
I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.459
Are you serious?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.671
It's a sophisticated take.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.998
He doesn't look
like Santa Claus.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.335
No, he doesn't.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.508
I told her
Santa would be here.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.547
Yeah, well, I was told
that Holly would be here,

21:21.614 --> 21:22.809
single and ready to date.

21:22.882 --> 21:23.941
And we all got misled.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.142
Who told you that?

21:25.284 --> 21:28.914
Nora Ephron,
in every romantic
comedy ever made.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.248
So is it an open relationship?

21:31.590 --> 21:33.115
Oh, God, no.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.488
Well, you're almost 40.
Oh, do you not want kids?

21:35.561 --> 21:38.588
Oh, I want kids.
I really want kids.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.860
But A.J. and I are
practically engaged.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.092
We talk about
spending our lives together.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.228
So where's the ring?

21:44.370 --> 21:45.463
Kelly!

21:45.771 --> 21:47.535
How are you
adjusting to the move?

21:47.606 --> 21:48.733
Nobody cares about that.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.642
Look,
you have to make him commit,
or kick his butt to the curb.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.906
You guys,
I don't think any of us

21:53.979 --> 21:55.948
are really qualified
to be giving Holly

21:56.015 --> 21:57.643
personal advice
about her love life.

21:57.716 --> 22:00.550
Yeah, I mean,
maybe Holly's not
in any position

22:00.619 --> 22:02.713
to be shooing guys away.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.458
I don't get it. I'm sorry.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.460
I just... I don't get it.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.796
Okay, listen,

22:11.864 --> 22:15.596
I'm gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
by the end of this year,

22:15.668 --> 22:16.658
we're over.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.868
Wow, an ultimatum.
Yeah.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.138
It doesn't
really seem like you.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.801
That is a great idea.
Ultimatums are key.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.743
Basically,
nobody does anything
for me anymore

22:26.812 --> 22:28.508
unless I
threaten to kill myself.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.122
Don't... Stop. Dwight!

22:43.495 --> 22:46.693
Dwight, stop!
Oh, no. Oh, no!

22:46.765 --> 22:48.358
Stop!
Oh, no.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.732
Yes, taste my wrath!
Okay. Okay...

22:50.803 --> 22:52.032
You like that?
Seriously!

22:52.638 --> 22:53.867
Okay. Okay.

22:57.343 --> 23:00.108
Yes, I have a wig
for every single
person in the office.

23:02.147 --> 23:06.084
<i>You never know when you're</i>
<i>gonna need to bear a passing</i>
<i>resemblance to someone.</i>

23:06.886 --> 23:08.855
I just want it to stop.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.213
So cool, right?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.792
There's no connection
between the origin
story and the quest.

23:13.859 --> 23:14.849
Okay.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.418
We need to know
who Jimmy Halpert was

23:16.495 --> 23:17.758
before he was
bitten by the bear.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.856
Otherwise it's
the bear's quest.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.567
Okay, well,
I just sort of meant,
like, cute, right?

23:22.701 --> 23:23.794
Well,
did you come here for help,

23:23.869 --> 23:25.599
or did you come here for me
to tell you how great it is?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.466
I mean, help,
if it's something simple,

23:27.539 --> 23:29.667
like add page numbers
or laminate it or...

23:29.742 --> 23:32.371
It sounds like you
know what you want.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.777
It's also a little derivative
of a serial called <i>Bear Man.</i>

23:34.847 --> 23:35.871
Did you look that up?

23:35.948 --> 23:36.938
No.
Okay.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.375
Oh, Jim. Hey.
Hey, Toby.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.854
There's this
female stenographer
at the courthouse...

23:43.923 --> 23:45.357
No way.
Who looks exactly like you.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.120
That's incredible.
Yeah. No, it's uncanny.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.787
You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect
with you right now.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.728
Hold on one second.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.763
Excuse me.

24:12.651 --> 24:15.018
<i>I guess there are</i>
<i>just some people</i>

24:15.087 --> 24:17.181
<i>who you stay together with</i>
<i>when you transfer,</i>

24:17.256 --> 24:18.656
and some people you don't.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.215
And that's just the way it is.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.892
<i>And I can be</i>
<i>mature about that.</i>

24:35.808 --> 24:38.835
It's so cold.
Even with my coat on.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.570
Maybe your senator boyfriend
has a blanket in his car

24:41.714 --> 24:43.182
for screwing Americans.

24:43.282 --> 24:46.650
Yet another opportunity
where a blanket
would have come in handy.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.420
You guys,
this has to stop.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.853
Someone could have
really gotten hurt.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.222
What if Meredith was taking
her smoking break
below that window?

24:53.292 --> 24:54.760
You know what
would have happened?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.989
The shards of glass
would have shaved
her face right off.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.256
And, yes,
it might have been funny,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.630
but it also would have
been incredibly tragic.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.793
I could not agree more.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.667
And I just want to
state for the record that
I am intending to sue Jim

25:05.738 --> 25:07.434
for acute
psychological distress.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.499
What are you talking about?
You're the one terrorizing me.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.603
With snowballs, Jim?
With fluffy little snowballs?

25:13.779 --> 25:15.441
No. I thought we
were just playing.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.573
Dwight's right.

25:16.648 --> 25:19.675
What you did was dangerous
and inappropriate.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.311
I'm really
surprised at you guys.

25:21.453 --> 25:23.786
Last time I was here,
you were both best friends.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.659
All this arguing reminds me
of a very funny story.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.256
You see this on my desk?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.626
You know who gave me this?

25:36.702 --> 25:38.933
My girlfriend Tara,
who lives in New York City.

25:39.004 --> 25:40.267
DWIGHT: Wait,
what girlfriend?

25:40.406 --> 25:41.669
I haven't told you about her.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.841
I find that unlikely.
You email me when
you get a new zit.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.209
I'm a man in my mid-40s
and I still get zits.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.747
I think that's
pretty interesting.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.579
But you know what,
I am not on trial here,
the Scranton Strangler is.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.482
So anyway,
we have this great weekend,

25:53.552 --> 25:55.214
and she drives
me to the airport,

25:55.287 --> 25:59.054
and we get to JFK,
but I'm flying
out of La Guardia.

25:59.124 --> 26:00.820
So we laugh and
laugh and laugh,

26:00.893 --> 26:02.156
and then we spend
the rest of the day

26:02.227 --> 26:04.719
walking around slo-mo
drinking latte.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.665
And at the end of the day,
she gives me this,
and she says,

26:07.733 --> 26:10.703
"Michael, maybe next time,
you should take a cab."

26:12.237 --> 26:13.569
I didn't know you
had a girlfriend.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.540
I do. She is.

26:15.607 --> 26:18.167
Did you see her face?

26:18.977 --> 26:22.505
Well, it seems to me
that there is a person
sitting out there in the annex

26:22.581 --> 26:25.517
that still has feelings
for Michael G. Scott.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.753
And it ain't Tara.

26:29.354 --> 26:30.913
So you went
homemade this year.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.480
Yep.
Yeah.

26:33.158 --> 26:35.286
Money problems.
Is that what this is about?

26:35.694 --> 26:37.925
I mean, oh, dear,
I don't think we
can help you out.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.966
No, no. Jim had
a great year, actually.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.864
I just wanted to
get your opinion.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.801
Are you good at homemade?

26:45.104 --> 26:46.094
Look at this.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.203
Yeah.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.708
Who did this?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.080
It's obvious to me
I'm not welcome here,

26:58.150 --> 27:00.745
but somebody better
tell me who did this,
or else I'm leaving.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.414
Well, I don't think
Erin seems to like you.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.253
That's not true.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.986
I don't know her enough
to make a decision even.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.823
What happened?
What happened?

27:09.361 --> 27:10.659
Toby, what did you do?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.759
I think Toby's very jealous
of all the attention
you've been getting.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.424
No, I would never ever
do anything like that.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.300
But it does seem like
something you would do.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.168
Oh, really? Turn it on me.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.738
Well, isn't that nice?
Thank you very much.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.640
Wait, wait, guys, listen.

27:25.177 --> 27:29.877
<i>Toy Story</i> is all about
toys that come to life
when people aren't looking.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.818
You don't think...
It's not possible

27:33.752 --> 27:36.312
that Woody did
this to himself?

27:36.622 --> 27:37.817
MICHAEL: It is Christmas.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.257
No, it really seems like
something Michael would do.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.796
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
Well, the fact that
you would think that

27:43.862 --> 27:46.627
points to the possibility
that it is probably not me.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.160
And that I have been framed.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.461
Why would anyone
frame you for that?

27:49.535 --> 27:51.265
Okay, I'm sorry,
why are we discounting

27:51.336 --> 27:53.805
this whole
"Woody came to life"
thing so quickly?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.410
Surprise!
It was part of the party.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.647
Pretty funny, huh?

28:03.782 --> 28:05.182
You think this is funny?

28:06.585 --> 28:07.609
I don't.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.156
But someday I think
we will laugh about this.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.158
When we tell our kids...
Yikes.

28:13.659 --> 28:16.527
Oh, my God.
All right! Shh!

28:17.329 --> 28:18.695
Okay. You know what,

28:18.797 --> 28:21.130
Holly, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.535
An accident borne
of jealous feelings.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.973
Michael,
you have to let this go.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.771
I'm with someone else.
I don't feel that way anymore.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.035
Oh, really?

28:32.110 --> 28:34.170
Well,
you certainly seemed jealous

28:34.246 --> 28:36.408
when I told you
about my fake girlfriend.

28:36.481 --> 28:37.813
That's what Jim
and Dwight thought.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.409
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
No, fake girlfriends
are always wrong.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.478
You made up a fake girlfriend
to see if I'd get jealous?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.649
And you destroyed a gift
my boyfriend gave me?

28:45.724 --> 28:46.953
What is the matter with you?

28:48.961 --> 28:52.728
When you got transferred,
and I drove you up to Nashua,

28:52.831 --> 28:56.324
you said,
"Michael, I love you,
but I can't do this."

28:56.902 --> 28:59.736
But then, with this other guy,
you don't have any problem

28:59.805 --> 29:01.467
with a long-distance
relationship, do you?

29:02.441 --> 29:03.773
And you know what,

29:04.409 --> 29:07.072
that is what is
the matter with me.

29:08.213 --> 29:12.514
Michael, I'm sorry...
And we did this whole
stupid party for you.

29:17.522 --> 29:18.581
No.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.594
You guys,
it wasn't my fault.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.096
Nothing is ever your fault.

29:28.634 --> 29:34.198
Just like when you
ate those maple candies
that you brought for us!

29:39.444 --> 29:41.345
I really think
you're better off.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.849
Mmm. Erin, would you do me
a favor and find my street
clothes for me, please?

29:45.917 --> 29:46.976
Yeah.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.755
Is she an amazing cook
or something?

30:03.902 --> 30:06.770
"Hey, Pickles,
Merry Christmas.
Open immediately?

30:07.205 --> 30:09.231
"Love, Swiss cheese."

30:15.514 --> 30:16.607
Damn it, Dwight!

30:17.416 --> 30:19.009
Didn't think your
affectionate nicknames

30:19.084 --> 30:21.417
would be your undoing,
did you, Jim?

30:21.486 --> 30:22.818
Let that be
a lesson to you all.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.789
So do they bring in food,
or do you get to go out?

30:28.860 --> 30:30.226
No, they bring it in.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.990
You lucky son of a bitch.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.431
I have been trying
to get on jury duty

30:35.500 --> 30:38.993
every single year
since I was 18 years old.

30:39.204 --> 30:43.767
To get to go sit in
an air-conditioned room
downtown, judging people

30:43.842 --> 30:45.834
while my lunch is paid for...

30:45.911 --> 30:48.847
 That is the life.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.010
Daddy, I'm bored.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.451
Can I read my book
in your office?

30:54.653 --> 30:56.485
Sure, sweetie.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.362
Jada, Darryl,
I'm so glad I found you guys.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.965
A Grinch stole the star
from on top of
the Christmas tree

31:07.032 --> 31:09.024
and is hiding it in
the warehouse somewhere.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.065
You want to go
help me find him?

31:18.076 --> 31:20.068
Oh, my goodness.

31:29.488 --> 31:33.550
I am the mean old Grinch.

31:33.759 --> 31:38.288
The little girl who wishes
to win back the Christmas star

31:38.563 --> 31:43.627
must first succeed
at these challenges.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.866
That sounds fun
and Christmasy,
you mean old Grinch.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.465
What kind of challenges?

31:50.542 --> 31:53.410
Something like
an obstacle course,
Mr. Grinch?

31:53.478 --> 31:58.815
No. You must answer
topical political questions.

31:59.651 --> 32:04.749
How many congressmen
is the state of
Pennsylvania guaranteed?

32:05.090 --> 32:08.891
And what other state
has the equal number?

32:09.795 --> 32:10.888
I don't know.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.521
Do you know the other state?

32:12.664 --> 32:16.328
Maybe the Grinch hid
the Christmas star,

32:16.802 --> 32:18.862
and we could ask for clues,

32:19.070 --> 32:22.097
and he'll tell us
if we're hot or cold.

32:22.407 --> 32:25.309
The star has been hidden.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.403
Is the little girl
hot or cold?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.312
Well, it turns out
she's burning up

32:30.382 --> 32:34.683
because the star is
right behind her ear!

32:35.320 --> 32:37.687
And the game's
over seconds later.

32:37.756 --> 32:38.815
I'm so glad you could come.

32:38.890 --> 32:39.880
It's nice. I know.

32:40.325 --> 32:44.126
Hey, everybody,
this is my boyfriend,
Senator Robert Lipton.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.390
Hi.
Senator, it's an honor.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.831
I'm Angela's friend Oscar.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.500
Oscar. A pleasure.

32:51.536 --> 32:54.096
Robert seems great.
He's very handsome,

32:54.206 --> 32:56.869
firm handshake, he's gay,
good sense of humor.

33:07.018 --> 33:08.179
Hi.
Hello.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.551
I'm A.J.,
I'm here to see Holly.

33:10.689 --> 33:11.918
It's kind of a surprise.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.460
I know who you are,
and I think you should go.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.458
I bet you didn't even
bring us anything, did you?

33:17.696 --> 33:19.665
Was I supposed to
bring you guys something?

33:19.831 --> 33:23.063
What? A.J.!
Surprise.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.860
What are you doing here?

33:24.936 --> 33:26.461
I wanted to see you.
Oh, my God.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.905
How are you?
Wow! Nice.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.806
Oh, God, you look great.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.276
When did you get here?

33:33.378 --> 33:35.006
Just now. Just now.
Hey.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.809
Hey, Michael.
Good to see you again, A.J.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.543
Welcome.
Pleased to see you.
Thank you.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.313
Good trip down?
Yeah, it was great.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.047
Good, good.
Good to see you.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.390
Have fun. Enjoy the party.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.823
I am dead inside.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.725
What do you want, baby?
We got some granola,

33:53.798 --> 33:55.824
got some cupcakes,
chips, apples, pies.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.299
You have a whole room
of vending machines.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.133
I know. Isn't it something?

34:02.440 --> 34:04.432
I can't decide what I want.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.744
Merry Christmas.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.018
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.455
A Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.092
A Merry Christmas.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.797
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.596
And Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.837
Merry Christmas.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.462
Oh, thank you.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.242
For your feet.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.005
It's amazing.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.911
It's so great. Thank you.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.847
For me?
Yes.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.614
Thank you very much.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.897
I don't know if you
guys have had a chance

35:05.971 --> 35:08.440
to use the new parking meters
that accept credit cards,

35:08.506 --> 35:11.203
but Robert was instrumental
in that legislation.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.776
Wow, that's awesome!

35:14.045 --> 35:15.343
A real David
and Goliath story.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.645
I'm just so touched
that she's so interested
in my work.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.144
ANGELA: I am.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.016
MEREDITH: The real problem
is the teachers' union.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.453
Zip it, Meredith.
No.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.922
You tell me why my kid is 17
and still can't read.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.617
Hey, who's in charge
of making drinks around here?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.591
Is there a bartender?
You are.

35:30.695 --> 35:31.856
You make your own drink.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.093
I'll make it.
What are you drinking?

35:35.166 --> 35:36.794
An F train to Brooklyn.
Extra bitters.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.061
I don't know
how to make that.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.537
Okay, well, I'll just
stick with my Mojito.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.105
And you know
those annoying
geese at the park?

35:43.208 --> 35:45.074
Well, he's helping
eradicate them as well.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.173
I mean, I think
they've really become a pest.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.235
Annoying.
Yes.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.282
I don't think
he's in the ceiling, babe.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.548
Well, I don't think
any of us really know.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.960
All right.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.200
Is it...

36:14.272 --> 36:16.173
Is it pebbles from
that beach in Jamaica?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.071
Go easy with the shaking.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.987
Oh, my God.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.420
You like it?

36:36.795 --> 36:38.320
I love it.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.661
Yep, I do make
great Christmas gifts.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.192
But I couldn't make that.

36:44.335 --> 36:46.031
All right, my turn.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.437
Oh, it's just... I didn't...

36:48.506 --> 36:50.566
I didn't have a lot of time,
so that's just a place holder.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.235
Right. Of course.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.111
<i>"The Adventures</i>
<i>of Jimmy Halpert."</i>

37:00.452 --> 37:02.512
Oh, my God.

37:02.754 --> 37:05.121
This is awesome!

37:05.256 --> 37:06.588
That's my bike.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.118
That's my desk.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.129
And that is my daughter.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.631
I mean...

37:22.707 --> 37:24.039
I don't like
to talk about it.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.142
Better office policy up there.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.377
KEVIN: But it should be
the same policy as us.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.017
Okay.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.754
Michael, wait.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.758
Hey, hey, no, don't run.
You're gonna slip.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.159
That's good advice.
Yep.

37:47.766 --> 37:52.329
I read this story
about a woman who slipped
on some black ice,

37:52.403 --> 37:55.100
and she hit her head
and went into a coma forever.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.804
And then every day,
her husband went

37:57.876 --> 38:00.402
and visited her in
the hospital until she died.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.607
That's a sad story.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.249
Yeah, well,
at least he was married.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.452
Okay, Michael, slow down.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.951
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.382
No, it's not. It's not.

38:11.823 --> 38:16.124
Oh, man,
I can tell you confidently
that it is not gonna be okay.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.324
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

38:23.101 --> 38:24.592
A.J. won't commit to Holly.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.564
And she's gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
to her

38:28.640 --> 38:30.438
by the end of the year,
it's over.

38:31.709 --> 38:32.733
Really?

38:32.877 --> 38:33.936
Really.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.917
And I don't know about you,
but I don't know
a lot of happy marriages

38:38.983 --> 38:41.214
that start off with
an ultimatum. Do you?

38:42.854 --> 38:43.913
No.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.883
So just be patient.

38:49.527 --> 38:52.019
Yeah. I mean,
I can wait till then.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.967
Come here.
I don't want you to fall.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.639
I surrender.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.770
I do not accept
your surrender.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.211
There's only one way
that I would ever relent.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.105
Anything. You got it.

39:10.615 --> 39:14.814
You hit Pam in the face with
a snowball while I watch.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.117
You're a psychopath.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.518
I'll take that as a no.

39:19.557 --> 39:21.753
I was in the mall,
and I saw that,

39:21.826 --> 39:23.658
and I thought it had
your name written all over it.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.925
Michael, this is the gift
that corporate gave us
that I picked out.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.990
You're re-gifting this to me.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.929
No, that's not...

39:32.971 --> 39:35.941
No, I went to the mall
and I picked that out
especially for you.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.033
Oh, yeah?
Well, show me the receipt.

39:39.944 --> 39:41.970
From the mall.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.474
That...

39:44.549 --> 39:46.780
This is a fast food
receipt from April.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.178
That...

39:48.253 --> 39:49.949
God, how many number nines
did you order?

39:51.055 --> 39:53.718
A.J.: Is everyone here
kind of mean?

39:54.626 --> 39:57.858
I think everyone's
on edge because of
the Strangler trial.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.955
Hey, I'm so glad
you came down.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.665
It's been so much
harder than I expected.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.928
Hey, what happened to Woody?

40:05.203 --> 40:08.435
Oh, okay, get ready for this.
You're not gonna believe it.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.409
I was making salad,
and he fell right
into the dressing.

40:12.477 --> 40:15.208
I mean,
there was salad
dressing all over him.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.714
He smells awful.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.282
It was blue cheese dressing.

40:18.516 --> 40:19.779
Great.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.721
Hey, Mike.
Hey.

40:23.788 --> 40:26.019
We wanted to
give you something.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.285
Merry Christmas.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.055
Thank you.
A Hostess apple pie!

40:30.128 --> 40:32.461
This is my favorite breakfast.
How did you know that?

40:32.597 --> 40:33.690
Thank you very much.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.901
What do you say?
You're welcome.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.437
Oh, you know,
I seem to remember

40:39.504 --> 40:41.200
that Santa promised
that he would listen

40:41.272 --> 40:42.934
to all the gifts you
wanted for Christmas.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.031
Didn't he say that?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.098
Yeah.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.106
I think I know where he is.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.742
A trampoline.
Mmm-hmm.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.578
Video games.
Video games.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.777
DSi.
DSi.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.480
A horse.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.815
A pool.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.913
Are you sure you
don't want a pony?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.183
You want a real horse?
Yes.

41:01.259 --> 41:04.161
All right. You have
to pick up after them.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.130
Hey, sorry. I'm ready.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.124
I don't want to go.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.796
Oh. Come on, Bear Man.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.734
Come on.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.079
Have you ever
seen them do that?

41:35.426 --> 41:37.190
I'm sorry.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.524
I had no idea.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.258
No, it's okay.

41:41.699 --> 41:43.668
Okay.
Oh, my God.

41:43.801 --> 41:45.565
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

41:55.313 --> 41:56.611
Okay, this is it.
What?

41:56.681 --> 41:58.274
Go! Go! Go!
What? What is it? What?

41:58.349 --> 41:59.612
Oh, my God!

42:03.054 --> 42:05.546
Honey? Jim?

42:12.430 --> 42:13.921
Jim!

42:17.735 --> 42:21.297
In the end,
the greatest snowball
isn't a snowball at all.

42:21.739 --> 42:22.968
It's fear.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.676
Merry Christmas.
