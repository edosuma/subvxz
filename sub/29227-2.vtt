<i>Previously, on</i>
"The Affair"...

00:05.814 --> 00:07.593
When this job opened up,

00:07.685 --> 00:09.413
I thought to myself,
here's my chance

00:09.501 --> 00:10.872
to actually make a difference

00:10.960 --> 00:12.656
with the kids
nobody else wanted.

00:12.828 --> 00:14.474
We gave your whole
nonnegotiable

00:14.562 --> 00:16.609
discipline policy
a fair shake.

00:16.828 --> 00:18.015
It didn't work.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.434
I'm your boss.

00:19.545 --> 00:21.156
I'm your boss.

00:21.718 --> 00:24.208
"My mother lives and breathes
academic success.

00:24.296 --> 00:26.405
The only thing she hates
more than failure

00:26.493 --> 00:27.826
is my father."

00:28.010 --> 00:29.919
You and Carl,
you got to work

00:30.007 --> 00:31.975
through whatever issues
you got going on.

00:32.218 --> 00:33.963
And you're who the fuck?

00:34.358 --> 00:35.803
People don't really know me,
you know?

00:35.890 --> 00:37.395
They, they, uh,
know my movies,

00:37.483 --> 00:39.270
they see me
as this action hero,

00:39.358 --> 00:41.116
this sort of
modern-day James Bond.

00:41.204 --> 00:42.349
But that's all an act,
of course.

00:42.436 --> 00:43.952
When I picked up
your book,

00:44.225 --> 00:45.749
it just spoke to me, man.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.427
I know it's a real act
of faith,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.786
putting your work in the hands
of another artist

00:49.874 --> 00:51.466
to interpret,
but I want you to know,

00:51.554 --> 00:53.293
I am not going
to let you down.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.960
You're saying you
actually think the producers

00:56.048 --> 00:58.733
of Fun Home would give you
the rights to direct

00:58.821 --> 01:00.593
- a student production?
- Yeah.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.673
So practice your pitch
on me first.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.351
You would do that?

01:04.485 --> 01:05.985
I love you.

01:06.180 --> 01:07.680
I love you.

So, how is it?

03:10.438 --> 03:12.587
How are your classes?
Have you made any friends?

03:12.735 --> 03:14.673
Nah. No one talks to me.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.983
What do you mean?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.462
I'm kidding.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.329
Yeah, I've made friends.

03:20.741 --> 03:23.024
Actually, I'm thinking about
going for student government.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.093
Student government? Wow.

03:26.180 --> 03:27.962
You can do that as a freshman?

03:28.135 --> 03:30.141
Yeah, they set aside
spots for the first-years.

03:30.229 --> 03:32.479
Trying to get people
involved early, I guess.

03:33.954 --> 03:36.204
I don't know,
it kind of sounded fun.

03:37.274 --> 03:38.780
I guess all your years
of, uh,

03:38.868 --> 03:41.102
"Be the change"
finally got through.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.602
Hey, you listening?

03:44.292 --> 03:47.430
Of course. I'm sorry. My bad.

03:47.711 --> 03:48.924
You okay?

03:49.012 --> 03:50.712
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.274
So, have you, uh,
seen your grandparents yet?

03:54.430 --> 03:56.093
Oh, they live,
like, an hour away.

03:56.180 --> 03:57.719
You better get to it.

03:58.188 --> 03:59.383
Yeah.

03:59.883 --> 04:01.293
Hey, Ant.

04:01.704 --> 04:03.235
I'm really proud of you.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.463
Yeah, all right. Bet.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.501
Well, I'll see you later,
Mom. Bye.

04:08.079 --> 04:10.196
Okay, have fun, be safe.

04:10.441 --> 04:12.196
Thank you for calling me.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.837
I love you.

04:28.993 --> 04:30.413
Hey, Noah.

04:31.430 --> 04:32.928
Janelle! Sorry.

04:33.016 --> 04:35.663
Were you, were you waiting?
My phone was on silent.

04:35.751 --> 04:37.639
Not at all.
I just got here. Um...

04:37.727 --> 04:38.944
I didn't want to interrupt,

04:39.040 --> 04:40.670
but I also
wouldn't want to be late.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.196
Oh, no, we... this is Janelle,
my girlfriend.

04:43.313 --> 04:44.507
Very nice to meet you.

04:44.595 --> 04:46.374
Noah won't stop
talking about you.

04:46.462 --> 04:48.274
Really?

04:48.720 --> 04:50.593
The school I was telling you
about, where I work?

04:50.680 --> 04:52.040
Janelle is the principal.

04:52.128 --> 04:53.993
Oh. You're his boss?

04:54.081 --> 04:56.579
I mean, I usually don't
lead with that, but...

04:56.667 --> 04:58.030
She's worked for decades in...

04:58.118 --> 04:59.811
with kids
in Compton and-and Watts

04:59.899 --> 05:01.594
and kids that no one else
cares about.

05:02.024 --> 05:03.608
You two
are doing amazing work,

05:03.696 --> 05:05.389
I mean... and, uh,
I know you have to run,

05:05.477 --> 05:06.590
so I won't keep you.

05:09.691 --> 05:11.086
It was very nice to meet you.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.725
Nice to meet you, too...

05:12.813 --> 05:15.305
I'm sorry, Noah didn't
mention your name.

05:19.383 --> 05:20.572
That's funny.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.251
Yeah.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.243
Sorry, did I miss something?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.280
What? You didn't tell me.
How was I supposed to know?

05:29.391 --> 05:30.673
Noah.

05:30.782 --> 05:32.407
The look on his face.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.024
He's so huge.

05:34.112 --> 05:35.945
He's... have you never
seen the Maze movies?

05:36.321 --> 05:38.321
- Nope. Never did.
- Snake Junction?

05:38.409 --> 05:40.042
Fortitude?

05:40.138 --> 05:42.131
He was in all those?
Wow, he's really big.

05:42.219 --> 05:44.065
Oh, my God.

05:58.712 --> 06:01.899
Oh, and Martin's home
from his ROTC summer program.

06:02.081 --> 06:04.696
- He's the oldest?
- No, that's Whitney.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.063
Got it. So,
it's Whitney,

06:07.204 --> 06:08.555
Trevor, Stacey...

06:08.712 --> 06:11.540
No, no. Martin
then Trevor then Stacey.

06:12.132 --> 06:14.045
- Right. Okay.
- Okay, then there's Pr...

06:14.133 --> 06:16.397
And then there's Vik's parents,
who are Priya and Abdul.

06:16.485 --> 06:18.554
Then there's Helen
and then Helen's parents,

06:18.656 --> 06:20.601
Bruce and Margaret.

06:21.359 --> 06:22.914
Priya...

06:24.320 --> 06:26.250
Abdul, Priya.

06:26.672 --> 06:28.258
Helen's parents,

06:29.211 --> 06:31.633
- Bruce...
- And Margaret.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.811
- Margaret, sorry.
- No, don't be.

06:33.899 --> 06:35.329
I'm just glad you're here.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.454
This is so fucking
weird for me.

06:43.901 --> 06:45.531
Noah.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.343
Jesus. Fuck.

06:49.765 --> 06:51.264
Helen never mentioned

06:51.352 --> 06:52.790
a dress code.

06:54.704 --> 06:56.610
Let's just go inside.

07:05.313 --> 07:08.165
Guys. Hi.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.000
Hi.

07:12.444 --> 07:13.923
Guys, this is Janelle.

07:14.011 --> 07:15.712
Hey, hello.

07:15.979 --> 07:17.812
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.343
You're Janelle?
I had no idea.

07:20.430 --> 07:22.680
- Hi.
- You're gorgeous.

07:23.196 --> 07:25.891
I can't wait for you guys
to get to know each other.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.811
The soul is spoken of

07:28.899 --> 07:31.407
as invisible,

07:31.813 --> 07:33.673
inconceivable,

07:33.970 --> 07:36.407
and unchangeable.

07:48.790 --> 07:51.046
- Excuse us.
- Oh, God.

07:51.134 --> 07:52.293
Sorry...

07:52.657 --> 07:54.891
for your loss.

08:25.126 --> 08:26.618
Hello?

08:27.516 --> 08:31.235
No. No, Joel, I'm not gonna
FaceTime you, I'm at a...

08:36.345 --> 08:37.688
Hello?

08:38.440 --> 08:40.842
Thanks for calling me back,
and for speaking this way.

08:40.929 --> 08:43.053
I-I thought we should
talk face-to-face,

08:43.140 --> 08:44.852
mano a mano, you know?

08:45.548 --> 08:47.626
That's not what
mano a mano means.

08:47.743 --> 08:49.173
Oops, sorry.

08:49.399 --> 08:52.710
Not you.
I ran into somebody.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.126
What is it, Joel?

08:54.214 --> 08:56.928
I know that we have a more
formal commencement meeting,

08:57.016 --> 08:58.978
but I just wanted
to call in advance

08:59.066 --> 09:02.142
and say that I am humbled,
I am honored

09:02.230 --> 09:05.553
- and I am so excited.
- About what?

09:05.964 --> 09:08.713
Obviously, we both know that
I wanted your job, Janelle,

09:08.801 --> 09:11.668
but I think this
is a perfect compromise.

09:11.863 --> 09:13.519
How so?

09:13.863 --> 09:15.463
Co-principals.

09:15.683 --> 09:18.213
You and me,
both bringing our A game.

09:18.301 --> 09:19.672
Look, I know
that you probably have

09:19.760 --> 09:21.053
your reservations,
because you,

09:21.140 --> 09:23.166
you and I had our tensions
in the past,

09:23.254 --> 09:25.947
but I just wanted
to call and tell you

09:26.035 --> 09:28.605
that I am putting
all of that behind me.

09:29.363 --> 09:31.843
I am committed to starting
this position

09:31.949 --> 09:33.575
with a clean slate.
Let bygones be bygones.

09:33.662 --> 09:35.912
I'll be the yin
to your yang...

09:37.514 --> 09:39.081
Uh...

09:40.040 --> 09:43.382
thank you, Joel,
for, uh, calling.

09:43.470 --> 09:46.930
Of course.
We're on the same team now.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.093
I'll let you
get back to, uh...

09:51.180 --> 09:53.795
Funeral, Joel.
I'm at a funeral.

09:54.033 --> 09:55.946
Oh, wow. Okay.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.842
Well, that's not great.

10:00.017 --> 10:03.249
So, who died?

10:21.869 --> 10:23.692
Oh, uh, hey.

10:23.780 --> 10:26.176
I just wanted to say
I think it's so awesome

10:26.264 --> 10:28.173
that you're
my dad's girlfriend.

10:28.538 --> 10:30.090
Dating a woman of color
might be

10:30.178 --> 10:32.428
one of the coolest things
he's ever done.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.590
"Girlfriend" is a strong word.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.602
Who knew wearing white at a
funeral is a Hindu tradition?

11:08.890 --> 11:11.053
It's crazy
Helen didn't tell me.

11:11.477 --> 11:14.045
Her husband just died.
Maybe you weren't top of mind.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.520
Yeah, well, I just didn't want
you to think it was my fault.

11:16.608 --> 11:19.600
Of course not.
It was an honest mistake.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.942
Ugh, God, these movie people.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.093
They think they own you.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.020
Sweetheart, would you
mind grabbing me a drink?

11:26.108 --> 11:27.716
I'll take anything
with scotch in it.

11:27.804 --> 11:31.054
Excuse me? I-I don't think
I'm who you're looking for.

11:31.221 --> 11:33.155
And all these empty glasses...

11:33.258 --> 11:34.397
they could disappear.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.608
It doesn't look very
professional, you know?

11:41.094 --> 11:42.296
If you think that's bad,

11:42.384 --> 11:43.960
you should see the way
he talks to me.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.546
The valet is
being impossible.

11:48.634 --> 11:49.798
I don't know what to do.
I just need them

11:49.885 --> 11:51.248
- to park the cars.
- Uh...

11:51.336 --> 11:53.749
Helen,
do you remember Janelle?

11:54.052 --> 11:55.960
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

11:56.195 --> 11:58.728
Hi, of course.
Um, I'm so sorry for y...

11:58.956 --> 12:02.166
I'm so sorry. Um, if there's
anything we can do to help,

12:02.254 --> 12:03.520
- if...
- Actually,

12:03.608 --> 12:05.546
would you mind going
and talking to the valet?

12:05.634 --> 12:07.674
You might have more luck
than me or Noah.

12:09.933 --> 12:12.773
Of course. Happy to help.

12:20.558 --> 12:22.262
Okay.

12:23.293 --> 12:24.528
You okay?

12:24.676 --> 12:27.192
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, are you?

12:27.331 --> 12:28.829
I think I was sent

12:28.926 --> 12:30.411
out here to help you
with something.

12:30.538 --> 12:32.455
I was just trying to tell
the lady in charge

12:32.543 --> 12:34.215
that someone took
their keys inside.

12:34.364 --> 12:37.247
It's no big deal,
there's just a car double-parked.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.364
Won't matter
till people start to leave.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.981
Right. Got it. Thanks.

12:45.491 --> 12:47.293
Motherfucker.

13:23.717 --> 13:25.747
You know, in many ways,
you've done a great job.

13:26.057 --> 13:27.534
- The kids love you.
- It's true.

13:27.622 --> 13:29.106
You really get them.

13:29.363 --> 13:32.098
As you'll see,
this is not a demotion.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.641
No. Think of it as a chance
to develop your strengths

13:35.729 --> 13:37.450
and work on those weaknesses.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.395
Which are?

13:43.731 --> 13:46.801
Oh, well, uh,
the student walkout,

13:46.889 --> 13:48.830
uh, discontent
from the teachers,

13:48.918 --> 13:50.114
a number of complaints

13:50.202 --> 13:52.050
that you're uninterested
in the opinions of others

13:52.137 --> 13:54.262
and dismissive
of their concerns.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.698
Uh, to be honest,
uh, we'd expected

13:56.786 --> 13:58.627
you to go above and beyond
when it came

13:58.715 --> 14:00.161
to meeting us
and the staff halfway,

14:00.249 --> 14:02.434
particularly as
an outside hire. I-Instead,

14:02.582 --> 14:04.720
many people who worked
with you felt...

14:04.807 --> 14:06.010
- ill at ease.
- Ron.

14:06.442 --> 14:07.720
The important thing is

14:07.808 --> 14:10.582
that this co-principal
arrangement will help

14:10.684 --> 14:13.075
you and Joel play
to your strengths.

14:13.163 --> 14:15.309
Right. Exactly.

14:15.513 --> 14:17.876
Since Joel's so fantastic
with people, we think

14:17.964 --> 14:20.778
he can help ease some of
the school-wide tensions.

14:20.866 --> 14:22.820
Work in some of
the restorative

14:22.908 --> 14:25.582
justice techniques,
handle partnerships

14:25.677 --> 14:29.176
and programs, attend, uh,
district meetings, and...

14:29.309 --> 14:33.903
essentially be more of
a public face for the school.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.293
While you will focus
your energy internally,

14:37.406 --> 14:39.459
continuing the administrative
work you've tackled

14:39.547 --> 14:42.192
so beautifully, and, uh, working
one-on-one with the students,

14:42.280 --> 14:44.177
of course, we love that you have
such high expectations

14:44.264 --> 14:47.262
for them... and sharing
the responsibility

14:47.350 --> 14:49.192
of liaising
with the teachers.

14:49.381 --> 14:50.594
The new contract

14:50.682 --> 14:53.005
for you to review
and sign.

14:53.257 --> 14:55.514
The sooner you get it
back to us, the better.

14:55.706 --> 14:57.616
Only a few weeks
till the new school year.

16:00.545 --> 16:02.088
Always the same knock.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.340
Figured I'd give you a heads-up.

16:04.491 --> 16:06.725
Since you tend to have company.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.530
Come in.

16:15.650 --> 16:17.473
- It's, uh...
- Don't bother.

16:17.653 --> 16:20.389
I know when you're about
to say something you don't mean.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.936
Fine.

16:23.181 --> 16:24.754
Fine.

16:25.616 --> 16:27.553
Could you take a look at this?

16:29.786 --> 16:31.116
What is it?

16:31.478 --> 16:33.600
It's a contract from CA.

16:33.983 --> 16:37.816
They want me to...
co-principal.

16:38.506 --> 16:39.840
With who?

16:39.927 --> 16:42.381
One of the other teachers.
His name is Joel.

16:42.530 --> 16:43.616
Do I know him?

16:43.711 --> 16:47.004
He's only
been there a, a few years.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.241
Before that?

16:50.160 --> 16:53.073
Grad school.
This is his first teaching job.

16:53.161 --> 16:54.324
How old is he?

16:54.412 --> 16:55.593
He's white.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.468
Of course.

16:57.949 --> 16:59.077
They want us to

16:59.165 --> 17:01.077
split responsibilities.

17:01.246 --> 17:03.489
I'd cover internal
administrative stuff,

17:03.577 --> 17:05.577
he'd be the "face"
of the school.

17:18.186 --> 17:20.632
You always drink
before giving legal advice?

17:20.720 --> 17:24.319
Actually...
this is for you.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.546
And my salary gets cut by 15%.

17:35.249 --> 17:37.046
I can see that.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.625
Well...

17:40.843 --> 17:42.720
from what I can tell,
it's standard.

17:42.807 --> 17:44.758
And what you're telling me
matches what they have on paper,

17:44.845 --> 17:46.155
so...

17:48.631 --> 17:50.452
you can go ahead and sign.

17:55.468 --> 17:58.226
Is that all?
Or do you need something else?

18:04.687 --> 18:06.590
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

18:06.804 --> 18:08.710
- You seem upset.
- I don't know

18:08.798 --> 18:11.591
why I keep expecting you
to give a shit about me.

18:11.679 --> 18:13.210
Why'd you come here
tonight, Nell?

18:13.307 --> 18:14.351
I have no idea.

18:14.439 --> 18:15.593
Clearly, it was a mistake.

18:15.681 --> 18:17.023
Oh, I'll tell you why.

18:17.119 --> 18:19.589
You came 'cause you wanted me
to tell you not to sign that.

18:19.677 --> 18:22.288
Well, you know what?
That's not my job anymore.

18:22.376 --> 18:23.437
Excuse me?

18:23.525 --> 18:24.898
If you wanted me
to be your heavy,

18:25.001 --> 18:26.639
you should've never left me.

18:26.913 --> 18:28.882
You're still a motherfucker,
you know that?

18:28.970 --> 18:30.085
I'm a motherfucker?

18:30.173 --> 18:32.765
I left you because you
were having an affair

18:32.887 --> 18:34.444
with your 26-year-old protégé.

18:34.532 --> 18:36.054
Once. That happened once.

18:36.142 --> 18:38.863
And for you to have the gall
to sit there and,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.700
and reframe the narrative so
that you're still the victim?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.030
- Somehow. Always.
- You want to

18:44.118 --> 18:45.164
talk about playing the victim?

18:45.251 --> 18:46.300
You show up on my doorstep

18:46.388 --> 18:48.398
unannounced,
after all these years,

18:48.486 --> 18:49.550
waving a piece of paper

18:49.638 --> 18:51.257
talking about "Poor me!"

18:51.345 --> 18:53.678
How could the terrible
white people do this to me?"

18:54.386 --> 18:55.914
I'll tell you how they can
do it to you.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.211
Because you let them.

18:58.215 --> 18:59.913
You always let them.

19:07.629 --> 19:09.366
And I'll tell you
something else.

19:10.637 --> 19:12.421
I've been seeing a therapist.

19:13.815 --> 19:16.124
- You're what?
- And my therapist

19:16.212 --> 19:17.226
thinks you relied on me

19:17.314 --> 19:19.031
to be the militant ideologue
in our marriage,

19:19.118 --> 19:21.608
so you could go out in the world
and be the compromise.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.608
I don't have
to listen to this.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.229
And you know what gets to me
after all that?

19:27.639 --> 19:28.932
You went out
and told everybody

19:29.020 --> 19:30.399
it was my fault
our marriage failed.

19:30.486 --> 19:32.600
You needed me to behave
a certain way to legitimize you

19:32.687 --> 19:34.148
and then you left me for it.

19:34.243 --> 19:36.459
I left you because you
were having an affair, Carl.

19:36.547 --> 19:37.813
Does your therapist
know about that?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.429
- Once.
- Which is one too many times.

19:40.524 --> 19:42.055
- That's not why you left me.
- Yes, it is.

19:42.142 --> 19:43.171
You're not being honest
with yourself.

19:43.258 --> 19:44.903
- Carl!
- What?

19:44.991 --> 19:46.880
- I'm leaving.
- Fine.

19:47.052 --> 19:48.452
Oh, wait.

19:50.464 --> 19:52.663
Don't forget
your social contract.

19:58.257 --> 19:59.968
Just give me the fucking thing.

20:00.056 --> 20:01.194
Are you gonna sign it?

20:01.335 --> 20:03.788
Probably.
What choice do I have?

20:08.417 --> 20:10.218
Damn!

20:10.895 --> 20:12.228
What is wrong with you?

20:12.316 --> 20:14.140
What's wrong with me?
You're the one hitting things.

20:14.227 --> 20:15.624
You've been in this field
20 years.

20:15.712 --> 20:17.109
You really gonna give up
half your power

20:17.196 --> 20:18.781
to a white kid who's gonna
take all the credit

20:18.868 --> 20:20.621
and let you do all the work?

20:20.709 --> 20:22.003
Maybe they're right.

20:22.152 --> 20:25.565
Maybe I'm not good for this job.
I'm too opinionated.

20:25.653 --> 20:27.719
I'm domineering,
I'm not maternal enough.

20:27.807 --> 20:30.321
- You're not what?
- I don't play well with others, Carl.

20:30.676 --> 20:32.507
That's part of this job, right?

20:32.785 --> 20:34.786
I mean, you can't just be
the visionary,

20:34.874 --> 20:37.903
you have to make everyone
feel good about themselves

20:37.991 --> 20:39.469
- while you're doing it.
- No, you don't.

20:39.556 --> 20:42.139
There must have been
some reason for this.

20:42.385 --> 20:43.918
If I was doing
a good enough job,

20:44.006 --> 20:45.879
they would've just
let me keep doing it.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.874
No, don't you get it?

20:48.637 --> 20:50.220
They don't want you
to do this job,

20:50.307 --> 20:52.655
because they don't want you
to do the job at all.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.207
They don't want you.

20:59.348 --> 21:00.952
Why not?

21:12.062 --> 21:14.366
So you're saying
I never had a chance?

21:15.417 --> 21:17.740
I don't know what you want me
to tell you anymore.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.509
You wanted to change the system
from the inside.

21:20.597 --> 21:22.444
I never thought that would work.

21:25.568 --> 21:27.571
So you must feel pretty good
about yourself

21:27.659 --> 21:29.054
knowing you were right.

21:32.163 --> 21:34.741
I don't feel good about myself.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.194
I have been...

21:44.730 --> 21:47.249
teaching for half my life.
I have three degrees.

21:47.337 --> 21:49.507
When is it gonna be enough?

22:00.712 --> 22:02.569
Janelle, you're brilliant.

22:03.224 --> 22:05.585
And I know you wanted that
to protect you somehow,

22:05.673 --> 22:08.702
to lift you up and carry you
above all this bullshit,

22:08.927 --> 22:10.702
and it should have.

22:12.358 --> 22:14.156
You should've been
the one person in the world

22:14.243 --> 22:16.496
where color just didn't matter.

22:16.675 --> 22:17.710
I never said that.

22:17.798 --> 22:19.291
But, baby...

22:19.726 --> 22:22.840
I've been telling you
the same thing for 25 years.

22:23.062 --> 22:24.874
But you never want to listen.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.380
So I'm gonna tell you
this one last time.

22:28.475 --> 22:30.483
After that, you're on your own.

22:31.936 --> 22:33.577
It's not you.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.069
It's them.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.467
You want a water
or something?

22:52.468 --> 22:54.467
Yeah.

23:01.427 --> 23:02.843
Thank you.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.671
A therapist, huh?

23:07.530 --> 23:09.296
Yeah.

23:09.564 --> 23:12.577
Just... trying new things.

23:12.968 --> 23:14.343
She any good?

23:14.431 --> 23:15.594
Nah.

23:15.682 --> 23:17.175
It's a brother.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.556
Which took a while.

23:19.155 --> 23:20.800
You know how hard it is
to find

23:20.887 --> 23:23.257
a black therapist in L.A.?

23:24.949 --> 23:26.098
Mm.

23:30.257 --> 23:31.598
You need me...?

23:31.686 --> 23:33.544
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

23:36.261 --> 23:38.301
Oh.

23:43.419 --> 23:45.802
You know, someone thought
I was a waiter today.

23:48.996 --> 23:51.270
And this dress cost $1,000.

23:53.887 --> 23:55.505
Go ahead.

23:56.958 --> 23:59.723
You spent $1,000 on a dress?

24:03.389 --> 24:05.544
What am I gonna do, Carl?

24:06.067 --> 24:07.880
Anton's at school.

24:08.223 --> 24:10.473
This job is my whole life.

24:10.967 --> 24:12.970
How am I just gonna
walk away from it?

24:13.057 --> 24:14.770
What am I gonna do instead?

24:33.299 --> 24:34.934
I have one idea.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.460
You know
Compton Academy's coming up

24:37.547 --> 24:40.005
on their district performance
review next year, right?

24:40.824 --> 24:44.126
What if,
instead of signing those papers,

24:44.214 --> 24:46.917
you run for
Unified School District's board?

24:47.348 --> 24:49.520
You'd set policy
for all the charter schools.

24:49.608 --> 24:52.561
Plus, you'd technically be
Joel's boss.

24:52.887 --> 24:56.458
Hell, you'd be Ron's boss.

24:59.519 --> 25:01.309
Don't come from within.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.903
Come from above.

25:05.794 --> 25:07.434
No.

25:08.263 --> 25:09.528
I'd never win.

25:09.616 --> 25:11.372
Not alone.

25:13.403 --> 25:14.831
You know I helped Ava T.

25:14.919 --> 25:17.057
Get elected to the 44th, right?

25:17.799 --> 25:20.552
Ava Tompkins
is gonna be a state senator?

25:21.801 --> 25:23.880
You mean the girl
who used to babysit Anton?

25:23.968 --> 25:25.817
- Mm-hmm.
- How old is she?

25:25.905 --> 25:28.794
Thirty-four, and she's a star.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.278
Defeated 12 candidates,
including the incumbent.

25:32.435 --> 25:34.268
So, you fucking this girl?

25:34.356 --> 25:36.019
Are you serious?

25:36.543 --> 25:38.911
No, I'm not.

25:38.999 --> 25:41.282
Why not, if she's so amazing?

25:41.848 --> 25:44.825
And you obviously make
such a good team.

26:07.057 --> 26:09.307
I'm not fucking Ava Tompkins...

26:11.559 --> 26:14.646
..'cause Ava Tompkins is not
the woman I want to be with.

26:41.941 --> 26:43.005
I was happy.

26:43.093 --> 26:44.724
So was I. But then I wasn't.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.515
I'm in love with someone else.

26:46.603 --> 26:48.966
No. Don't do that, Ellen.

26:49.104 --> 26:50.465
Let's talk.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.458
What is there to talk about?

26:53.068 --> 26:55.740
No. If you want to go,
you should go.

26:55.828 --> 26:57.943
Can't we at least
talk about this?

27:03.747 --> 27:05.177
Was she here?

27:05.658 --> 27:06.981
Did you...

27:07.404 --> 27:08.920
In this house?

27:09.007 --> 27:10.662
In our be...

27:14.967 --> 27:18.260
Um... Th-This is, um...

27:18.451 --> 27:19.630
Hey, this is not right.

27:19.718 --> 27:21.262
I mean, something is...
Can we just cut there

27:21.349 --> 27:22.389
- for a second, please?
- That's a cut.

27:22.476 --> 27:23.553
- Um...
- Really? I thought that was...

27:23.640 --> 27:24.295
- No?
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:24.405 --> 27:26.788
You were devastating.
I'm entirely the problem here.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.921
Um, can I watch playback,
please?

27:29.217 --> 27:30.491
Sure, you got it.

27:49.858 --> 27:51.382
You okay?

27:52.029 --> 27:54.009
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm tired.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.170
Of course she's not okay, Dad.
Look at her.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.655
She's riddled with PTSD.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.196
I'm fine.

27:59.616 --> 28:00.749
They changed the schedule.

28:00.837 --> 28:02.887
It was supposed to be a
family breakfast scene,

28:02.975 --> 28:05.075
but then the kid
playing Martin,

28:05.163 --> 28:07.550
he apparently twisted one
of his balls at the gym,

28:07.637 --> 28:09.038
and they have to switch it.

28:11.365 --> 28:12.710
You sure you're okay?

28:12.798 --> 28:14.838
Will you fucking stop? I'm fine.

28:15.927 --> 28:18.835
Okay, fine. Great.

28:22.011 --> 28:23.874
So, what did you think?

28:26.507 --> 28:28.108
Be honest.

28:28.196 --> 28:29.479
I...

28:29.747 --> 28:31.330
You know, what do I know, Noah?

28:31.637 --> 28:33.760
It was... it was...
it was super.

28:34.077 --> 28:36.046
I'm gonna go get some coffee.

28:45.637 --> 28:47.514
Oh, no.

28:47.730 --> 28:49.303
It was that bad, was it?

28:50.491 --> 28:52.108
We actually put
you to sleep.

28:52.237 --> 28:53.560
Oh, no.

28:53.850 --> 28:55.663
Uh, I had a late night.

28:56.606 --> 28:57.769
Are you with the studio?

28:58.004 --> 28:59.421
No.

28:59.626 --> 29:00.756
S-So, you're...

29:00.999 --> 29:04.171
Uh, so, I'm, uh...

29:05.319 --> 29:06.819
Helen.

29:06.907 --> 29:08.288
Helen?

29:08.780 --> 29:10.069
Helen.

29:11.264 --> 29:13.597
Oh, fuck me.

29:14.546 --> 29:17.522
Noah didn't let on that
you were coming, the tosspot.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.341
I'm so terribly sorry
you had to see that...

29:20.429 --> 29:21.937
Oh, I don't care, really.

29:22.025 --> 29:23.568
But it was shit, wasn't it?

29:23.656 --> 29:26.124
Please, be honest.
J-Just tell me the truth.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.804
I see
y-you've found Helen.

29:29.445 --> 29:31.101
- This is my daughter.
- Whitney.

29:31.242 --> 29:33.599
- Hi.
- Who is very young,

29:33.687 --> 29:34.800
very engaged.

29:34.887 --> 29:36.387
- Jesus, Dad.
- Mazel tov.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.737
You were amazing
in that scene.

29:37.847 --> 29:39.510
- You were so vulnerable.
- Thank you.

29:39.637 --> 29:42.170
I'm just trying to do justice
to your father's words, really.

29:42.257 --> 29:44.010
Aren't we all?

29:44.476 --> 29:47.137
Noah's told me
so much about you.

29:48.057 --> 29:50.630
I'm dying to know
what you thought.

29:50.717 --> 29:52.300
Did that feel just forced now?

29:52.387 --> 29:54.262
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

29:54.465 --> 29:56.220
I... That felt
really right.

29:56.307 --> 29:58.340
I don't know, N...
It seems that the dynamics

29:58.428 --> 30:00.168
are off somehow.
Don't you think?

30:00.293 --> 30:03.481
Um... In what way?

30:03.713 --> 30:06.660
I keep finding myself
trying to comfort her, right?

30:06.755 --> 30:08.128
But that's not the scene,
is it?

30:08.262 --> 30:10.753
Sasha, w-we could talk
about this in the trailer.

30:10.841 --> 30:12.580
- This is kind of weird for Helen.
- Oh, fuck.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.254
- Forgive me. I-I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

30:14.341 --> 30:16.167
It's really not weird at all.
I'm fine.

30:16.255 --> 30:18.214
And you're not the problem,
she is.

30:18.537 --> 30:20.370
You s... I thought
you said it was great.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.407
Look, I don't know
anything about this,

30:23.495 --> 30:25.706
it just seems to me
that the actress

30:25.794 --> 30:28.629
is coming off kind of, I don't
know, broken, or something.

30:28.717 --> 30:30.988
And I think she needs
to be more of a bitch.

30:31.428 --> 30:32.917
Really?

30:33.134 --> 30:34.955
Well, you want to like
your character, right?

30:35.043 --> 30:36.581
What's his name? Daniel?

30:36.685 --> 30:38.082
His hero?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.123
Well, uh, maybe antihero.

30:40.211 --> 30:41.954
Yeah, so she should f...

30:42.257 --> 30:44.159
fight back.
You know, attack.

30:44.347 --> 30:46.400
That's it.
That's good, that's brilliant.

30:46.488 --> 30:48.340
Great. She should
be strong, right?

30:48.427 --> 30:51.050
Be more of a-a powerful foil
in this scene.

30:51.137 --> 30:53.206
You could be stronger, too.

30:53.294 --> 30:54.949
Jesus, Helen.

30:55.060 --> 30:56.393
Uh, sorry, man.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.128
No, it's fine.
I appreciate the candor.

30:58.222 --> 30:59.331
- It's great.
- Hey, dude.

30:59.396 --> 31:00.441
We got to be
done by noon

31:00.529 --> 31:01.456
- if we're gonna get our day.
- Thank you, Lisa.

31:01.544 --> 31:02.870
Thank you.

31:04.395 --> 31:05.745
You're extraordinary.

31:05.930 --> 31:06.986
Um...

31:07.074 --> 31:08.510
We're almost done.
I don't suppose

31:08.597 --> 31:10.831
you'd have lunch with me,
to finish this conversation?

31:11.020 --> 31:13.813
Oh, no, uh... N-No.

31:14.199 --> 31:16.034
This is really Noah's thing.

31:16.495 --> 31:18.925
Uh, so we should
get an Uber... what...

31:19.013 --> 31:20.637
We have to get to
my son's dress rehearsal.

31:20.724 --> 31:23.652
No? Really? That's odd.

31:23.997 --> 31:27.324
Um, well, very nice
meeting both of you.

31:27.464 --> 31:29.128
- You, too.
- You, too.

31:29.216 --> 31:30.667
I'm gonna walk 'em out.

31:31.547 --> 31:32.894
Hey, Helen.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.245
If you change your mind,
Noah knows where to find me.

31:55.511 --> 31:57.456
Hey, so that scene we just saw,

31:57.544 --> 31:59.941
was that really how it went down
with you and Dad?

32:01.675 --> 32:03.260
Pretty close.

32:04.159 --> 32:05.337
I mean, not exactly.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.454
The bra was in
a different drawer.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.128
Jesus.

32:09.358 --> 32:10.691
Was I home?

32:11.393 --> 32:13.066
I don't know.

32:14.229 --> 32:15.777
Yeah, I think...

32:16.042 --> 32:18.433
I think
you must have been home. Yeah.

32:18.639 --> 32:21.027
You shielded us from so much.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.420
Well...

32:23.721 --> 32:25.462
what was I supposed to do,
tell you

32:25.550 --> 32:28.316
your father was screwing
another woman in our bed?

32:28.441 --> 32:29.460
No. But you did more than that.

32:29.547 --> 32:31.355
You never gave up on him.

32:31.443 --> 32:33.566
You didn't let us
give up on him.

32:34.565 --> 32:36.050
He's your father.

32:36.613 --> 32:38.532
Yeah, but when I think
about how painful

32:38.620 --> 32:40.683
that must have been
for you, it's...

32:44.443 --> 32:46.136
Thank you.

32:49.144 --> 32:51.636
How come you and Vik
never got married?

32:52.993 --> 32:55.074
Well, fool me once...

32:58.507 --> 32:59.886
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

32:59.974 --> 33:02.128
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.238
I didn't.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.488
Not all men cheat.

33:12.177 --> 33:13.706
Sorry.

there was a rare moment
of perfect balance

34:08.815 --> 34:10.967
when I soared
above him.

34:15.848 --> 34:17.478
Great job!

34:27.387 --> 34:29.581
Can we bring
the house lights up?

34:30.315 --> 34:32.300
I got to go deal with my face.

34:47.847 --> 34:49.690
- Hey, lady!
- Hey, Lauren.

34:50.346 --> 34:52.556
Oh. Oh, God.

34:52.806 --> 34:55.050
Oh, will you look
at those two?

34:55.137 --> 34:57.182
Yeah.
Thick as thieves.

34:58.547 --> 34:59.970
How are you, sweetie?

35:00.064 --> 35:01.252
I'm fine.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.198
You keeping busy?

35:03.423 --> 35:05.696
I mean, they say that's
the most important thing.

35:05.784 --> 35:08.760
Yeah. Um,
my ex-husband is making a movie.

35:08.847 --> 35:10.159
So we were
on the set

35:10.247 --> 35:11.625
- today and...
- Oh, my God.

35:11.713 --> 35:12.971
Did you see him?

35:13.059 --> 35:14.836
- Noah?
- No, you whore.

35:14.924 --> 35:16.969
- Sasha Mann.
- Did she see him?

35:17.057 --> 35:18.237
- He asked her out.
- What?

35:18.325 --> 35:20.042
- He did not.
- Yes, he did.

35:20.130 --> 35:21.441
He asked her out
and she blew him off.

35:21.528 --> 35:24.344
Oh. Helen, you have to go.

35:24.432 --> 35:26.284
I mean, he is
the perfect man.

35:26.372 --> 35:29.610
No, I'm serious. He donates half
of every paycheck to charity.

35:29.698 --> 35:31.854
He teaches acting in prison.
And I've heard that,

35:31.942 --> 35:33.891
on all of his movies,
he buys the whole crew,

35:33.979 --> 35:36.380
like, super expensive
motorcycles as wrap gifts.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.627
How do you know all this?

35:37.715 --> 35:39.937
I read Us Weekly, Helen.
Oh, my God.

35:40.025 --> 35:41.065
Baby, that was

35:41.153 --> 35:43.875
- so amazing.
- Hi. Hi.

35:43.963 --> 35:45.320
- I'm serious.
- No.

35:45.408 --> 35:46.615
The second act
was a disaster.

35:46.703 --> 35:47.784
- No way. It was genius.
- Total Titanic.

35:47.871 --> 35:49.494
- No, stop. Really.
- No. No, look at us.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.955
We were bawling.
Look at my eyes.

35:51.043 --> 35:52.244
I was bawling the entire time.

35:52.332 --> 35:53.829
- We were both bawling.
- Weren't we, Mom?

35:53.916 --> 35:54.979
What was your, uh...

35:55.067 --> 35:57.166
what was
your favorite part, Mom?

35:58.646 --> 36:00.955
I'm just so proud of you, Trev.

36:02.757 --> 36:04.597
I think Vik would've liked it.

37:40.307 --> 37:42.677
No.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.752
So, do you actually call him
Mr. Mann?

38:30.432 --> 38:32.048
Hi.

38:35.572 --> 38:37.181
Thank you for coming.

38:45.547 --> 38:47.416
I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

38:47.504 --> 38:50.025
Why don't you just start
by coming in?

38:57.118 --> 38:58.673
Did you just move in?

38:58.761 --> 39:01.094
Uh, four years ago.

39:01.791 --> 39:03.220
You need some furniture.

39:03.414 --> 39:06.539
No. I find
I feel healthier with less.

39:06.884 --> 39:09.119
Um, I've made us
some tea.

39:09.207 --> 39:12.120
And the way that I'm preparing
our tea actually dates back

39:12.208 --> 39:15.118
to sixth-century
Buddhist monks.

39:16.611 --> 39:17.806
That's old.

39:17.894 --> 39:19.189
That is old.

39:19.330 --> 39:20.892
Please, sit.

39:22.243 --> 39:24.289
Legend has it
that the Bodhidharma

39:24.377 --> 39:26.369
struggled so badly
to stay awake

39:26.457 --> 39:29.459
during meditation
that he, in a desperate moment,

39:29.547 --> 39:32.541
ripped off his eyelids
to keep his eyes open.

39:32.807 --> 39:37.025
And from the fallen lids
sprung the tea plants.

39:38.884 --> 39:40.380
Huh.

39:41.025 --> 39:42.494
Well, point being

39:42.582 --> 39:44.117
that what began
as a practical thing,

39:44.205 --> 39:46.380
over time,
became its own ritual.

39:46.474 --> 39:49.816
I mean, its own form
of-of meditation.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.003
Thank you for coming
all this way.

39:54.116 --> 39:56.908
I'm up every night agonizing
over this film.

39:56.996 --> 39:59.292
I'm desperate to get it right.

39:59.426 --> 40:01.144
I'm sure you will.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.589
It's a very personal
story for me.

40:03.871 --> 40:05.720
The novel was formative,
and it gave me

40:05.807 --> 40:07.863
tremendous insight
into my own behavior.

40:07.951 --> 40:10.113
Really? Did you leave a wife
and four kids, too?

40:11.732 --> 40:13.485
Sorry. Bad joke.

40:13.813 --> 40:16.300
Noah speaks as if you and he
are the best of friends.

40:16.479 --> 40:18.342
Well, we are friends.

40:18.515 --> 40:21.058
But are you, maybe,
still harboring resentment

40:21.177 --> 40:23.050
after all these years?

40:24.022 --> 40:26.419
Okay, you said you wanted
to talk to me about the movie.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.426
Are there any specific questions
you wanted to ask or...?

40:28.513 --> 40:31.494
Mm-hm. When you said that Ellen
should be more of a bitch...

40:31.582 --> 40:33.167
I didn't s...
I don't think I said that.

40:33.255 --> 40:35.011
- I think you did.
- I don't...

40:36.394 --> 40:37.761
Let's check it.

40:38.355 --> 40:40.644
"Ellen should be more
of a bitch so that...

40:40.732 --> 40:42.548
- "Daniel can be our hero."
- You wrote that down?

40:42.635 --> 40:44.050
Yes, I did.
And it was a great note.

40:44.138 --> 40:45.172
Listen, you should've stayed.

40:45.259 --> 40:47.144
The next take was electric.

40:48.319 --> 40:51.394
But what is it that makes
her character so aggressive?

40:52.808 --> 40:55.010
Childhood?
Issues with her dad?

40:55.097 --> 40:57.460
I mean,
is she lashing out at people

40:57.547 --> 41:00.378
because she's frightened
she will never know love again?

41:02.547 --> 41:04.260
Can I ask you
an honest question?

41:04.347 --> 41:06.785
- Please.
- Do you like the book?

41:06.873 --> 41:08.074
Yes, I do. Do you?

41:08.162 --> 41:09.355
No, I don't.

41:09.443 --> 41:10.917
Because it's
about male ego?

41:11.057 --> 41:12.628
No, because it's not very good.

41:12.716 --> 41:15.089
But... so many people
really like it.

41:15.177 --> 41:17.402
Yes, but I'm not sure
that they're very smart.

41:17.980 --> 41:20.324
Well, um...

41:20.792 --> 41:23.072
Well, I just said
that I really like it.

41:27.011 --> 41:29.425
Are you always this honest?

41:31.103 --> 41:32.806
Uh...

41:32.894 --> 41:34.722
no.

41:35.597 --> 41:36.840
I'm going through something.

41:36.935 --> 41:38.480
It's really strange.

41:38.846 --> 41:40.880
- Um, you haven't touched your tea.
- I don't like green tea.

41:40.967 --> 41:41.949
I think it tastes like mulch.

41:42.037 --> 41:43.240
Have you tasted mulch?

41:43.427 --> 41:46.402
Listen, I know matcha
can be bitter, but, I mean,

41:46.497 --> 41:49.332
properly brewed,
it's actually quite good.

41:55.186 --> 41:56.894
You let it get cold.

42:05.425 --> 42:07.082
Sorry.

42:08.237 --> 42:10.183
This conversation
is not really working, is it?

42:10.271 --> 42:11.863
It's me.

42:12.642 --> 42:14.371
I'm just very tired.

42:14.855 --> 42:16.417
Thank you for the tea.

42:16.677 --> 42:19.939
Hey. Helen, please,
you came all this way.

42:20.027 --> 42:21.670
P-Perhaps something
brought you here today.

42:21.757 --> 42:23.300
- Your Tesla.
- Oh, come on.

42:23.387 --> 42:25.050
Listen, I just want
to get to know you.

42:25.137 --> 42:28.087
Can we just try something else?
I mean, a walk or a swim

42:28.175 --> 42:30.019
or I've got
these amazing yoga hammocks.

42:30.145 --> 42:31.847
- Yoga hammocks?
- Yes.

42:31.935 --> 42:33.082
They're really something.

42:33.170 --> 42:35.163
Um, no. I think
I'm just gonna get an Uber.

42:35.271 --> 42:37.299
No. Please. Basketball.

42:37.387 --> 42:38.917
Come on.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.973
You just want to go home and
keep googling your own demise?

42:45.176 --> 42:47.478
I don't know
why I said yes to basketball.

42:47.566 --> 42:48.671
I really don't know how to play.

42:48.758 --> 42:50.079
I love basketball.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.400
It's such an American game.

42:51.488 --> 42:53.209
And your son Martin
used to play, didn't he?

42:53.308 --> 42:54.920
- Yep.
- And, Helen,

42:55.007 --> 42:56.637
would you go to all his games?

42:57.387 --> 42:58.880
Can we just fucking play?

42:59.316 --> 43:01.007
Oh.

43:06.056 --> 43:07.402
- Ha!
- Hey, I thought

43:07.490 --> 43:08.542
you said you didn't play.

43:08.630 --> 43:10.886
Maybe a little bit
when I was in school.

43:12.061 --> 43:13.474
Aah.

43:13.562 --> 43:14.775
Obviously you didn't.

43:14.863 --> 43:16.097
Well, it's the
shirt, isn't it?

43:16.185 --> 43:17.848
It's too tight.

43:18.674 --> 43:20.894
Let me have
another go.

43:27.677 --> 43:30.057
Whoa!

43:33.464 --> 43:35.334
You're such a baller.

43:36.403 --> 43:37.665
Hey, Helen, think fast.

43:37.753 --> 43:38.996
Ow!

43:39.084 --> 43:40.377
Fuck!

43:40.673 --> 43:42.130
Fuck.

43:42.642 --> 43:44.717
Jesus. What the fuck?!

43:48.907 --> 43:50.858
Hey, I'm truly sorry.

43:50.946 --> 43:52.642
I really thought you saw me.

43:55.243 --> 43:56.880
You like Pinot
Noir, right?

43:56.967 --> 43:58.345
How did you know?

43:58.547 --> 44:00.165
Chapter three.

44:00.927 --> 44:03.306
I really don't
understand my life.

44:03.394 --> 44:05.307
- Can I see it?
- No.

44:05.502 --> 44:07.615
- Do you think it's broken?
- Probably.

44:07.740 --> 44:10.113
- Well, let me just have a look.
- Uh! Don't touch me!

44:10.201 --> 44:11.603
I'm not gonna
touch you.

44:16.183 --> 44:17.346
Oh, no. You're fine.

44:17.923 --> 44:18.949
It's not broken.

44:19.037 --> 44:20.962
- How do you know?
- Well, my nose was broken

44:21.057 --> 44:23.024
a few times. It swells
a lot more than that.

44:23.112 --> 44:24.645
You got lucky.

44:24.793 --> 44:26.118
Sorry.

44:26.241 --> 44:28.383
I got lucky. Yeah.

44:29.384 --> 44:30.938
Listen...

44:31.463 --> 44:35.548
one fine day, we'll look back on
this, and we'll laugh and laugh.

44:53.957 --> 44:55.870
I have to...
I don't... I don't,

44:56.082 --> 44:57.955
uh, know what I'm doing here.

44:58.137 --> 45:00.368
You seem like
a very nice... psychopath.

45:00.456 --> 45:02.337
- Well, I promise you, I'm not.
- I'm just...

45:02.425 --> 45:03.725
I really... I need to go.

45:05.410 --> 45:07.049
- Oh.
- Whoa. Whoa.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:08.526 --> 45:09.729
Hey, you need
something to eat.

45:09.817 --> 45:11.587
- Can I make you something?
- Uh, no. Mm-mm.

45:11.675 --> 45:12.869
What about a
little sugar, then?

45:12.956 --> 45:14.626
I think I'm gonna,
uh, throw up.

45:14.758 --> 45:15.670
- You serious?
- Yeah.

45:15.757 --> 45:16.591
- When?
- Now.

45:16.678 --> 45:18.149
Fuck.

45:18.856 --> 45:21.026
Here. Here you go.
Here you go.

45:30.677 --> 45:32.376
I'll just...

45:32.495 --> 45:34.575
go dispose of this.

45:47.355 --> 45:49.383
Helen?

45:50.307 --> 45:51.923
I'm so sorry.

45:53.823 --> 45:56.033
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

45:59.977 --> 46:01.510
Are you okay?

46:01.648 --> 46:02.916
Oh.

46:03.004 --> 46:04.287
- Ooh.
- Hey, hey.

46:04.576 --> 46:06.706
Sit over here.

46:08.347 --> 46:10.630
Come on. Come on over here
and sit down.

46:10.852 --> 46:12.282
Oh, God.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.282
Just sit down here.

46:14.494 --> 46:16.337
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Don't be.

46:16.427 --> 46:18.128
It's my fault.
I hit you in the head

46:18.216 --> 46:20.509
with a ball. I mean,
we should go to the ER.

46:20.597 --> 46:22.625
- You might have a concussion.
- No.

46:22.713 --> 46:25.166
I don't have...

46:25.387 --> 46:26.630
What?

46:26.717 --> 46:29.008
I don't have
a concussion. I...

46:32.729 --> 46:35.048
Um, I lost my partner.

46:38.885 --> 46:42.032
I lost my partner
a few months ago.

46:44.214 --> 46:46.134
Oh, my God.

46:53.082 --> 46:55.119
Something's just
not right with me.

46:55.207 --> 46:58.037
I can't wake up,
and I fell asleep on the 405...

46:59.224 --> 47:00.807
last week and just now,

47:00.895 --> 47:03.558
I fell asleep at my kid's play,
and I almost fainted.

47:03.837 --> 47:05.528
I just... I don't know
what's wrong with me.

47:05.615 --> 47:07.358
Just breathe. Just-just...

47:07.446 --> 47:08.630
You're okay.

47:08.718 --> 47:10.646
Just breathe.

47:15.779 --> 47:19.630
I-I just wasn't prepared for
how permanent it is, you know?

47:23.538 --> 47:26.279
I get it. He made his point.
He died. Now...

47:27.068 --> 47:29.052
Now when's he coming back?

47:31.931 --> 47:33.849
Death is relentless.

47:37.877 --> 47:39.685
I lost someone,
too, a few years ago.

47:39.971 --> 47:41.404
- I can't. I just can't.
- No.

47:41.492 --> 47:43.575
No, no, no, no,
it's not... No.

47:43.808 --> 47:45.931
All I'm trying
to say is that...

47:46.245 --> 47:50.224
after... after that,
I f... I felt truly lost.

47:50.388 --> 47:52.044
I did.

47:52.512 --> 47:56.200
And then, I started to
study with this Zen master,

47:56.288 --> 47:58.661
and-and he suggested
that I simplify my life,

47:58.807 --> 48:00.435
and-and that's when
I moved up here.

48:01.046 --> 48:05.386
And I gave away most of my
stuff, and it actually worked.

48:09.191 --> 48:11.361
You think that
I'm full of shit.

48:13.233 --> 48:15.483
I... I haven't decided yet.

48:18.137 --> 48:20.388
Before you write me off
completely,

48:20.568 --> 48:22.760
can I show you
just one last thing?

48:23.247 --> 48:24.967
Might help.

48:29.536 --> 48:31.552
How you doing in there?

48:32.587 --> 48:35.776
Admit it. You do
feel better, don't you?

48:38.757 --> 48:41.110
You know there's nothing
actually Buddhist

48:41.198 --> 48:43.380
about this, right, Sasha?

48:43.526 --> 48:45.884
Like, monks in Tibet are
not spending their time

48:45.972 --> 48:48.019
doing aerial yoga?

48:48.370 --> 48:50.097
I know nothing.

50:13.814 --> 50:15.079
Hey.

50:15.167 --> 50:16.892
Hey.

50:18.665 --> 50:20.368
I love you.

50:21.525 --> 50:22.840
And I'm...

50:23.080 --> 50:26.717
I'm so sorry for what
I'm putting you through now.

50:29.693 --> 50:33.228
And if I know you,
you're trying to do this alone.

50:34.361 --> 50:36.590
You don't want
to worry anyone, so

50:36.908 --> 50:39.307
you're hiding your feelings
from everyone.

50:41.236 --> 50:43.800
Maybe you're even
a little bit surprised

50:43.887 --> 50:45.642
by how much you miss me.

50:48.299 --> 50:50.931
But Helen, I need you
to listen to me now.

50:51.019 --> 50:53.109
For once in your life, just...

50:54.808 --> 50:56.884
Would you concentrate
on yourself now?

50:58.791 --> 51:00.951
Be a little selfish.

51:02.763 --> 51:05.096
You've taken care
of everyone else for so long.

51:05.184 --> 51:07.427
I just... I want you
to spend the rest of your life

51:07.552 --> 51:09.092
enjoying yourself.

51:12.478 --> 51:14.353
And... if you can't
do it for you,

51:15.439 --> 51:16.900
then do it for me.

51:19.597 --> 51:22.009
Live now for us both.

51:22.690 --> 51:24.189
Okay?

51:25.341 --> 51:27.002
Okay.

51:29.835 --> 51:31.634
Okay.

51:50.567 --> 51:52.150
Unrecognized deposit.

51:52.431 --> 51:53.670
Cannot compute biome levels.

51:53.757 --> 51:55.322
Shh. Shh. It's fine.

51:55.410 --> 51:57.373
Searching database
for unknown substance.

51:57.463 --> 52:00.217
No. No. Stop. Just-just flush.

52:00.305 --> 52:01.515
- Flush.
- One moment, please.

52:03.478 --> 52:06.101
Stop it, you asshole. Override.

52:06.307 --> 52:08.170
- Override!
- Code?

52:08.334 --> 52:09.791
Two-three-eight-two.

52:30.136 --> 52:32.009
Hmm? Mm. Mm.

52:32.261 --> 52:34.167
I... I just had breakfast
an hour ago,

52:34.255 --> 52:35.713
and I'm already
fucking famished.

52:35.801 --> 52:36.880
Want a cricket?

52:36.967 --> 52:38.402
- No, thanks.
- Mmm.

52:38.490 --> 52:40.199
God, I can't get
enough protein.

52:40.466 --> 52:41.966
How were the Keys?

52:43.316 --> 52:44.800
Bleak.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.988
I hope you were a pinch more
political with the client.

52:48.076 --> 52:49.279
I was honest.

52:49.752 --> 52:51.113
- Oh, boy.
- I told them

52:51.201 --> 52:52.463
mangroves were
the only chance they have

52:52.550 --> 52:53.826
to save the coast
in the long term.

52:53.913 --> 52:55.196
And?

52:55.284 --> 52:56.657
They went
with the swinging gate,

52:56.745 --> 52:58.697
which is barely
even a Band-Aid.

52:58.785 --> 52:59.871
Hmm.

52:59.959 --> 53:01.644
But construction starts
next month,

53:01.757 --> 53:03.605
and now I'm available
for something else.

53:04.603 --> 53:06.980
Joanie, you just got back
from your third trip this month.

53:07.089 --> 53:08.949
You know, chill a little.

53:09.082 --> 53:10.840
Take time with your family.

53:11.566 --> 53:13.817
Laine, I don't judge you for
that carbon bomb in your belly.

53:13.904 --> 53:15.864
Don't judge me
for wanting to do my job.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.136
That was a joke.

53:21.464 --> 53:22.785
Hmm.

53:24.738 --> 53:26.832
Well, you're not gonna
like what I have.

53:26.966 --> 53:29.219
DOD's trying to
save an old base.

53:29.307 --> 53:32.467
Hmm. It'll be an erosion study,
probably a swinging gate.

53:33.467 --> 53:34.970
Where is it?

53:35.777 --> 53:37.199
Montauk.

53:41.189 --> 53:43.302
Well, that's how we stay
in business, right?

53:43.506 --> 53:45.746
Planned obsolescence,
keep 'em coming back

53:45.834 --> 53:47.754
every two years for more?

53:49.372 --> 53:50.972
I'll go.

54:44.434 --> 54:45.381
<i>Our apologies.</i>

54:45.468 --> 54:46.676
<i>The tracks are flooded.</i>

54:46.764 --> 54:48.757
<i>We should be moving shortly.</i>

54:59.575 --> 55:01.223
Hello?

55:01.311 --> 55:02.684
Hey.

55:02.772 --> 55:04.299
Hey. Did you make it?

55:04.387 --> 55:05.800
Almost.

55:06.004 --> 55:07.270
You still in Houston?

55:07.358 --> 55:08.520
We came back early, actually.

55:08.608 --> 55:10.141
They had to cancel the game.

55:10.229 --> 55:12.399
The entrance to the park
flooded again.

55:16.213 --> 55:17.364
How are the girls?

55:17.452 --> 55:19.301
They're, uh, they're great.
They miss you.

55:21.144 --> 55:22.747
Yeah, I know.

55:23.307 --> 55:25.512
Laine was desperate.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.067
She practically begged me

55:28.278 --> 55:30.460

55:30.887 --> 55:32.510
Where are you going to stay?

55:32.887 --> 55:34.380
Dad's place.

55:34.575 --> 55:35.970
Is that a good idea?

55:36.071 --> 55:37.611
It's fine.
