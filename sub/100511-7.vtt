00:00.078 --> 00:02.693
Previously on When <i>Calls the Heart...</i>

00:02.718 --> 00:03.929
I thought you might like these.

00:03.953 --> 00:05.897
<i>It's not every day that you get flowers</i>

00:05.922 --> 00:07.885
<i>from two handsome admirers.</i>

00:07.910 --> 00:10.049
I think it's best we
remain just friends.

00:10.074 --> 00:11.885
<i>I still can't believe I'm the lucky guy</i>

00:11.910 --> 00:12.910
<i>who gets to marry you.</i>

00:12.935 --> 00:16.142
<i>Thank you for loving me more
than I ever thought possible.</i>

00:16.167 --> 00:17.566
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:17.591 --> 00:20.625
<i>may I present to you
Clara and Jesse Flynn.</i>

00:23.793 --> 00:25.488
<i>Love is out there, Elizabeth.</i>

00:25.513 --> 00:28.613
<i>You just have to open yourself up to it.</i>

00:29.634 --> 00:35.971
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

00:35.996 --> 00:37.872
I thought you were leaving.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.250
Don't rush me.

00:41.285 --> 00:44.796
- My turn.
- Get ready, go!

00:45.925 --> 00:47.357
Good morning.

00:47.692 --> 00:49.008
Hi.

00:51.003 --> 00:53.221
For Allie's favourite teacher.

00:53.377 --> 00:55.973
Bribing a public official, Constable?

00:56.030 --> 00:59.230
Well, if you eat the evidence
then nobody finds out.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.857
Well, for the record, Allie
was getting an A anyway.

01:04.474 --> 01:06.276
I just came by to let
you know that Allie

01:06.301 --> 01:08.864
will be going home with
Opal's mother this afternoon.

01:08.889 --> 01:10.861
- Oh.
- I'm heading to Cape Fullerton.

01:10.886 --> 01:12.820
I've been called as a
witness in a trial.

01:12.845 --> 01:14.617
Well, that sounds interesting.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.037
Eh.

01:17.356 --> 01:19.269
I'll be back tomorrow though.

01:19.460 --> 01:22.166
I'll see you around town?

01:22.937 --> 01:24.585
Safe travels.

01:41.082 --> 01:43.316
Don't usually see you up this way.

01:43.515 --> 01:45.315
No, I suppose you don't.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.026
Recess is almost over.

01:49.704 --> 01:51.278
I better hurry then.

02:01.949 --> 02:03.542
Am I interrupting?

02:03.820 --> 02:06.192
Actually, I was just about to
call the children back in.

02:06.217 --> 02:07.795
Then I will be very quick.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.532
Do you have any plans
for Saturday evening?

02:10.726 --> 02:12.217
Tomorrow?

02:12.344 --> 02:14.218
No. Not really.

02:15.591 --> 02:17.264
There's this new English novelist,

02:17.289 --> 02:18.729
have you heard of Virginia Woolf?

02:18.754 --> 02:20.744
Yes. My sister, Viola, lives in England.

02:20.769 --> 02:21.832
She's a fan.

02:21.857 --> 02:23.589
She just sent me some
of her short stories.

02:23.614 --> 02:25.103
Well, Virginia Woolf is doing a reading

02:25.128 --> 02:26.291
in Union City tomorrow night.

02:26.316 --> 02:27.785
I read about that in the paper.

02:30.953 --> 02:32.779
Would you be my guest?

02:35.895 --> 02:37.595
I'm sorry, I really sprung that on you.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.079
No, no. Obviously, I
would love to, I just...

02:41.104 --> 02:43.427
Mrs. Thornton? Shouldn't recess be over?

02:44.406 --> 02:47.059
Yes. Yes, it should.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.094
Um, would you please
do the honours for me?

02:50.119 --> 02:51.285
Sure.

02:52.836 --> 02:55.051
Why don't you think about
it and let me know?

02:55.076 --> 02:56.510
I will.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.124
Thank you, Lucas.

02:59.197 --> 03:01.225
She'll be discussing
women and publishing.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.934
Right up your alley.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.149
Thank you.

03:09.410 --> 03:10.667
Alright, everyone.

03:10.692 --> 03:12.693
Please take out your workbooks.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.362
Turn to page 9.

03:40.585 --> 03:46.329
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:47.832 --> 03:49.376
This is them!

03:53.493 --> 03:56.079
Oh, there they are, the newlyweds.

03:56.104 --> 03:57.988
Welcome home!

04:02.409 --> 04:03.483
Welcome home.

04:03.508 --> 04:04.717
Hey.

04:05.021 --> 04:07.114
- So, how was Los Angeles?
- Yes.

04:07.139 --> 04:08.248
Oh, amazing.

04:08.273 --> 04:09.819
Gotta say, it feels good
to be home, though.

04:09.844 --> 04:11.010
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:11.035 --> 04:14.467
More importantly, did you
see any movie stars?

04:14.566 --> 04:17.154
We weren't really looking for any.

04:17.178 --> 04:19.427
- What?
- This is for you.

04:19.555 --> 04:21.163
Oh, the wedding photos.

04:21.188 --> 04:22.226
I hope you like them.

04:22.251 --> 04:23.750
I'm pretty pleased with
how they turned out.

04:23.775 --> 04:25.187
I am sure we will love them.

04:25.212 --> 04:26.454
Yeah, thanks Carson.

04:26.479 --> 04:28.313
You're welcome. Should we help them?

04:28.338 --> 04:29.794
Right, yes. Luggage. Of course.

04:29.819 --> 04:31.981
Whaddya got in here? A palm tree?

04:34.096 --> 04:35.863
So, what's new here?

04:36.046 --> 04:37.611
Well, let me see.

04:37.636 --> 04:40.044
Fiona had to go to San
Francisco very suddenly.

04:40.069 --> 04:41.854
Oh. Is everything alright?

04:41.879 --> 04:42.885
I think so.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.320
Honestly, she's been very
mysterious about all of it.

04:45.345 --> 04:47.221
- Clara!
- Oh!

04:47.246 --> 04:48.315
Welcome back!

04:48.340 --> 04:49.494
Oh, we missed you, too.

04:49.519 --> 04:50.697
Oh, us too.

04:50.722 --> 04:52.663
Ladies, this luggage isn't
getting any lighter.

04:52.688 --> 04:53.820
Let's get these guys home.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.422
Alright. Come on.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.154
Bye.

04:57.179 --> 04:59.216
<i>I think this is a palm tree.</i>

05:02.314 --> 05:03.431
Elizabeth.

05:03.456 --> 05:04.889
Rosemary.

05:05.050 --> 05:07.984
You know you're going to tell
me whatever it is eventually.

05:08.155 --> 05:10.228
You might as well make it now.

05:10.922 --> 05:13.294
Lucas dropped by the school
earlier with some tickets

05:13.319 --> 05:16.650
to a book reading out of town
in Union City tomorrow night.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.152
Virginia Woolf.

05:18.177 --> 05:20.935
Oh, my goodness. She's all the rage.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.782
What did you tell him?

05:22.897 --> 05:25.617
He's giving me some
time to think about it.

05:26.128 --> 05:28.454
Alright. What are you going to tell him?

05:30.180 --> 05:32.275
No, obviously.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.003
There's Little Jack to consider.

05:34.028 --> 05:35.868
It's an evening event out of town

05:35.893 --> 05:37.134
so I'd have to stay overnight...

05:37.159 --> 05:39.752
Elizabeth. You know
perfectly well Lee and I

05:39.777 --> 05:42.635
would be thrilled to have
Little Jack overnight.

05:42.914 --> 05:46.151
I think there might be something
else holding you back.

05:48.018 --> 05:49.775
I'm worried if I say yes to Lucas

05:49.800 --> 05:51.393
it'll give him the wrong idea.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.348
And then there's Nathan...

05:53.373 --> 05:54.455
Alright.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.548
Never mind about Lucas
and Nathan for a moment.

05:58.029 --> 06:00.363
What do you want to do?

06:02.310 --> 06:03.441
I wanna go.

06:03.466 --> 06:05.699
Well then go!

06:12.976 --> 06:14.296
Am I interrupting?

06:14.321 --> 06:15.988
Oh, no. Not at all.

06:16.013 --> 06:18.170
What can I uh, what can I do for you?

06:18.591 --> 06:21.108
Well, I've gotten used
to you strolling into

06:21.133 --> 06:23.759
the Queen of Hearts at the end
of each month with my cheque.

06:23.995 --> 06:25.031
And?

06:25.056 --> 06:26.855
The end of the month has come and gone.

06:27.077 --> 06:28.243
No cheque.

06:28.268 --> 06:29.796
Well, you're a business man,

06:29.821 --> 06:31.621
you understand how cash flow works.

06:31.668 --> 06:33.393
So there's a cash flow problem?

06:33.418 --> 06:34.917
A temporary one.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.976
I don't know that I'd
even call it a problem.

06:37.001 --> 06:38.868
But if there was a
problem as your partner

06:38.893 --> 06:40.151
I have a right to know.

06:40.186 --> 06:41.815
Minority partner and I'm telling you now

06:41.840 --> 06:43.488
that there isn't a problem.

06:43.846 --> 06:46.210
I can cut you a post-dated
cheque if you'd like,

06:46.235 --> 06:47.794
if it'd make you feel more comfortable.

06:47.819 --> 06:49.495
That won't be necessary, Henry.

06:49.552 --> 06:52.871
But as these issues come up I
would like to be kept informed.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.332
Message received.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.796
Is there anything else I can do for you?

07:01.115 --> 07:02.481
A favour.

07:02.620 --> 07:03.786
Ok.

07:03.811 --> 07:05.100
Can I borrow your car?

07:06.931 --> 07:08.721
Yes, you may.

07:12.568 --> 07:14.187
I could use some coffee.

07:14.212 --> 07:16.046
- How about you guys?
- I've got a patient.

07:16.071 --> 07:17.425
I gotta get back to the office.

07:17.450 --> 07:18.715
Me too.

07:26.064 --> 07:27.885
Welcome to your new home, Mr. Flynn.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.783
Why, thank you, Mrs. Flynn.

07:29.998 --> 07:31.452
Ah.

07:31.769 --> 07:33.135
I'll take that.

07:49.003 --> 07:50.479
I could get used to this.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.139
You better.

07:55.051 --> 07:56.651
Henry?

07:56.750 --> 07:58.651
Why is it that you make appointments

07:58.676 --> 08:00.705
if you're not going to keep them?

08:00.730 --> 08:05.699
Sorry, I just stepped across to
welcome Jesse and Clara home.

08:06.097 --> 08:08.990
So how can I help you?

08:09.139 --> 08:11.940
Well, I have a touch of indigestion.

08:11.965 --> 08:14.376
I wonder if you might
have something for that.

08:14.401 --> 08:15.662
I do.

08:15.859 --> 08:17.643
First, I'd like to examine you.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.557
Is that really necessary?

08:19.615 --> 08:21.127
I'm afraid so.

08:24.024 --> 08:26.690
Let's order a dozen of each of these.

08:28.081 --> 08:29.677
And...

08:31.423 --> 08:33.347
Let's finish this later.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.933
Come. Have a seat.

08:36.121 --> 08:37.267
Can I get you anything?

08:37.294 --> 08:38.927
I'm fine, thank you.

08:43.793 --> 08:45.985
So here you are.

08:46.545 --> 08:48.278
Here I am.

08:50.408 --> 08:52.908
What are your thoughts
on Virginia Woolf?

08:53.462 --> 08:56.162
Her writing is visionary.

08:56.813 --> 08:58.013
No, I meant...

08:58.038 --> 08:59.955
I know what you meant, I
was trying to be funny.

08:59.980 --> 09:01.613
Right.

09:04.838 --> 09:05.871
Lucas-

09:05.896 --> 09:07.619
Elizabeth, if you don't want to go...

09:07.644 --> 09:08.891
Yes.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.217
Yes?

09:11.247 --> 09:14.054
I would love to go with
you to the reading.

09:16.743 --> 09:17.919
That's wonderful.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.003
But...

09:19.242 --> 09:20.385
But?

09:22.348 --> 09:24.353
It was so sweet of you
to invite me and...

09:24.410 --> 09:26.268
and I really don't mean to presume,

09:26.293 --> 09:29.362
but... but if you were
in any way thinking

09:29.387 --> 09:32.031
that this might be a...

09:32.904 --> 09:34.741
Be a...?

09:36.178 --> 09:42.760
A date, then I'm sorry, I just...
I can't.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.472
Elizabeth, it would be my
pleasure to escort you

09:46.497 --> 09:49.298
in whatever way makes
you feel comfortable.

09:50.273 --> 09:52.551
Then I can't wait.

09:53.821 --> 09:55.805
I'll pick you up at 10:00 tomorrow?

09:56.132 --> 09:57.898
10:00 is perfect.

09:58.485 --> 09:59.970
Uh, what do I wear?

10:00.066 --> 10:01.509
Well, it's at the Yorkton

10:01.534 --> 10:03.734
and there's a formal
reception afterwards.

10:03.759 --> 10:04.980
Oh.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.942
Ok, great.

10:09.703 --> 10:11.111
Thank you.

10:27.903 --> 10:29.588
Well, you look happy.

10:30.343 --> 10:32.368
Lucas invited me to see a famous author

10:32.393 --> 10:34.510
in Union City tomorrow night.

10:36.170 --> 10:37.876
We're going strictly as friends.

10:38.062 --> 10:42.100
Elizabeth, you never have
to explain yourself to me.

10:43.655 --> 10:45.187
Thank you.

10:47.093 --> 10:48.900
I should be going.

10:55.395 --> 10:58.659
Well, your blood pressure is quite high,

10:58.949 --> 11:01.119
which often happens with stress.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.914
Well, welcome to working
in the oil business.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.603
When's the last time you took a day off?

11:05.628 --> 11:07.841
Look, I came in about a stomach problem.

11:07.866 --> 11:09.266
It's all connected.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.258
High blood pressure can lead
to stroke and heart disease,

11:12.283 --> 11:14.051
but you know that.

11:14.076 --> 11:16.384
Well, you know, crossing
the street can lead to you

11:16.418 --> 11:19.012
getting hit by a car, so there it is.

11:19.383 --> 11:21.588
Well, I'll give you something
for your indigestion

11:21.613 --> 11:24.518
but I'm also prescribing
time off from your desk.

11:24.793 --> 11:26.437
Ok.

11:38.656 --> 11:42.697
Oh, Carson did an amazing
job on the wedding photos.

11:42.722 --> 11:44.126
- Oh.
- We'll have to have him

11:44.151 --> 11:46.651
- over for dinner to thank him.
- That is a great idea.

11:47.450 --> 11:49.229
Where are the rest of your things?

11:49.416 --> 11:50.928
This is everything.

11:50.953 --> 11:53.338
It doesn't take much
to fill my old place.

11:53.770 --> 11:56.675
What about the easy chair that
Pastor Frank left with you?

11:56.814 --> 11:58.468
You said you loved that.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.542
It's falling apart.

12:00.912 --> 12:02.596
Oh. That's too bad.

12:02.957 --> 12:05.758
Oh, that will easily fit
on the shelves upstairs.

12:05.864 --> 12:07.438
Here, I'm going up.

12:07.463 --> 12:08.730
Thank you.

12:08.755 --> 12:10.925
Have a look at the photos.
I'll be right back.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.650
Ok.

12:31.714 --> 12:33.847
I hear you have big plans this weekend.

12:33.872 --> 12:35.504
Elizabeth told you?

12:35.529 --> 12:36.895
What did she say?

12:37.038 --> 12:39.248
Just that you're taking
her to Union City.

12:39.388 --> 12:40.489
Strictly as...

12:40.524 --> 12:41.951
Friends.

12:42.298 --> 12:43.972
Her words exactly.

12:45.581 --> 12:47.080
Excuse me.

12:47.194 --> 12:48.518
Hello?

12:48.866 --> 12:50.866
- Evening, Hickam.
- I'm starving.

12:50.902 --> 12:52.001
What's the special?

12:52.036 --> 12:53.498
Coq Au Vin.

12:55.147 --> 12:56.246
Chicken stew.

12:56.271 --> 12:57.488
That sounds good.

12:57.513 --> 12:58.913
Coming right up.

13:01.270 --> 13:07.138
Mike, has Henry said anything to
you about a cash flow problem?

13:07.734 --> 13:10.790
No, but I wouldn't really
know about that anymore.

13:10.815 --> 13:12.081
What do you mean?

13:12.106 --> 13:13.975
Well, I used to be
responsible for the accounts

13:14.000 --> 13:16.280
but Henry took that over a while ago.

13:16.885 --> 13:19.752
So nobody sees the books but him?

13:19.812 --> 13:21.718
Not as far as I know.

13:22.561 --> 13:23.693
Thanks.

13:28.940 --> 13:30.940
<i>Will you have a bite of peas?</i>

13:30.965 --> 13:32.771
<i>You love peas.</i>

13:33.955 --> 13:36.631
You know who's hungry? Dog.

13:36.656 --> 13:38.986
Can you feed Dog some peas?

13:42.305 --> 13:44.029
Very good!

13:44.054 --> 13:46.321
Good, Jack. Now you.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.311
Lee said you stopped by.

13:50.336 --> 13:53.404
So, what did you say?

13:54.363 --> 13:56.092
I told Lucas I'd go.

13:56.117 --> 13:57.436
Oh!

13:57.461 --> 13:59.410
Elizabeth, I am so excited.

13:59.435 --> 14:01.258
I need to know everything.
What did you say?

14:01.283 --> 14:02.582
What did he say?

14:02.607 --> 14:05.138
I need all the details.
I need all the details.

14:05.163 --> 14:06.545
The gentleman that he is,

14:06.570 --> 14:09.372
he agreed that we would be going
simply out of a mutual interest.

14:09.397 --> 14:11.248
A mutual interest in...

14:11.626 --> 14:13.271
Virginia Woolf.

14:14.879 --> 14:16.611
Alright.

14:16.836 --> 14:18.525
<i>Oh, Elizabeth.</i>

14:19.478 --> 14:21.615
This is the first time in,
well, this is the first time

14:21.640 --> 14:24.373
in forever that you've
been out on the town.

14:24.576 --> 14:26.110
I am so thrilled for you.

14:26.135 --> 14:27.949
Are you sure you don't mind taking him?

14:27.974 --> 14:29.076
Are you kidding?

14:29.101 --> 14:30.506
It's about time you asked.

14:30.531 --> 14:32.999
Lee and I can't wait to
have this little munchkin

14:33.024 --> 14:35.042
all to ourselves.

14:36.741 --> 14:42.269
Elizabeth, he is going
to be just fine with us.

14:42.294 --> 14:43.560
I know. I know.

14:43.585 --> 14:47.345
It's just... I've never been
away from him overnight before.

14:47.625 --> 14:52.059
Once in a while you are allowed
to do something just for you.

14:53.875 --> 14:57.188
Well, I do have one other favour to ask.

14:57.493 --> 14:59.107
Yes, what is it?

14:59.184 --> 15:00.727
We're going to the Yorkton.

15:00.752 --> 15:03.224
Can I please borrow something to wear?

15:03.261 --> 15:06.080
Oh, only the most elegant theatre

15:06.105 --> 15:07.315
this side of the Rockies.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.702
Oh, I have just the dress.

15:10.890 --> 15:12.892
I can't believe I'm doing this.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.582
Believe it.

15:20.418 --> 15:23.175
Thank you so much for lending
me one of your dress, Rosemary.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.565
They're all lovely.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.309
The one you selected is
absolutely stunning.

15:27.334 --> 15:28.933
Oh, accessories?

15:28.958 --> 15:30.421
I packed my mother's earrings.

15:30.446 --> 15:32.740
- Evening bag?
- A clutch I brought from Hamilton.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.463
- Shoes?
- Peau do soie pumps.

15:34.488 --> 15:35.931
You would think this was a fashion show

15:35.956 --> 15:36.966
and not just a reading.

15:36.991 --> 15:39.437
Oh, Elizabeth. Of course
it's a fashion show.

15:44.138 --> 15:45.626
Should I really be doing this?

15:45.651 --> 15:47.519
Elizabeth, yes.

15:47.679 --> 15:49.657
You owe it to yourself.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.117
Now, hurry.

15:55.386 --> 15:57.957
Mommy's gonna miss you so much.

15:59.932 --> 16:02.963
And he will miss you,
but he will be fine.

16:04.848 --> 16:06.380
Thank you for everything.

16:06.405 --> 16:07.967
It's my pleasure.

16:07.992 --> 16:10.463
Oh, I packed you an extra set
of pyjamas for him just in case

16:10.488 --> 16:12.597
but he likes the blue ones
with the yellow dots best.

16:12.622 --> 16:14.255
Blue ones with the yellow dots.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.503
I'll remember.

16:15.573 --> 16:17.925
And his new favourite song at
nap time is "This Old Man".

16:17.950 --> 16:19.886
Knick-knack, paddy whack. I got it.

16:28.017 --> 16:30.574
Elizabeth, answer the door.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.516
Can you come to Rosie?

16:34.541 --> 16:35.788
Yes.

16:45.279 --> 16:47.011
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:47.036 --> 16:48.644
- Ready?
- Mmmhmm.

16:48.669 --> 16:50.140
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

16:50.165 --> 16:51.511
Mmmhmm.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.827
Thanks, Jesse.

17:04.852 --> 17:06.766
It's got a rip in the back rest there.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.027
I don't know if that matters.

17:08.051 --> 17:09.737
<i>Oh, this? I could fix that.</i>

17:09.762 --> 17:11.751
There's some loose ends
here, if you want.

17:11.776 --> 17:13.115
Thanks.

17:13.140 --> 17:14.367
<i>Alright.</i>

17:19.210 --> 17:22.298
Now, be a good boy for Auntie
Rosemary and Uncle Lee.

17:22.323 --> 17:23.969
Mommy loves you so much.

17:23.993 --> 17:25.636
Awe.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.502
Not to rush you but we should
really-we should be going.

17:28.528 --> 17:30.433
- Of course.
- You drive safe, alright?

17:30.458 --> 17:32.480
- I will.
- Enjoy yourselves.

17:32.505 --> 17:33.605
Thank you.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.429
And don't you worry, I will bring
your mother home safe and sound.

17:36.454 --> 17:37.831
<i>Ma, mummy.</i>

17:37.856 --> 17:39.105
And don't forget to tuck Dog in

17:39.130 --> 17:41.269
beside him when he has his nap.
That's his favourite.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.754
We won't forget. -Mmmhmm.

17:43.225 --> 17:44.394
Bye, sweetheart.

17:44.426 --> 17:46.232
<i>Bye.</i>

17:48.706 --> 17:49.784
Thank you.

17:49.809 --> 17:51.075
You're welcome.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.696
Bye. See you tomorrow.

17:56.721 --> 17:57.725
Have fun.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.370
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:03.031 --> 18:04.864
<i>Have a wonderful trip!</i>

18:04.889 --> 18:06.669
There's only one question left.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.085
- What is that?
- Who's gonna tell Nathan?

18:09.834 --> 18:11.033
Uh-huh.

18:11.263 --> 18:13.551
Goodbye, sweetheart! Mommy loves you!

18:18.665 --> 18:20.513
Yeah, you have that one.

18:32.419 --> 18:34.645
Far be it for me to criticize,

18:34.670 --> 18:38.341
but Elizabeth was a bit of a
nervous Nelly this morning.

18:38.366 --> 18:40.301
I understand leaving your
child for the first time

18:40.326 --> 18:42.489
but it's not like we haven't
looked after him before.

18:42.514 --> 18:44.732
Exactly. I mean, he's one little boy.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.365
- How hard can he be?
- Yeah.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.253
Oh, uh, hmm...

18:51.349 --> 18:52.800
Hey, good morning.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.739
- Hi.
- Good morning.

18:54.764 --> 18:56.647
- Hey.
- Where are you coming from?

18:56.672 --> 18:58.615
Oh, Cape Fullerton. Oh.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.074
- Wonderful.
- Great.

19:00.099 --> 19:01.663
- Yeah.
- Hey there.

19:01.688 --> 19:03.888
You guys just giving
Elizabeth a little break?

19:04.123 --> 19:05.188
Yeah, um...

19:05.213 --> 19:07.356
Well, Elizabeth uh, had an engagement...

19:07.381 --> 19:08.772
A thing.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.407
- She had an engagement thing?
- Exactly.

19:11.432 --> 19:12.686
Right. Engagement thing.

19:12.711 --> 19:13.777
Yes.

19:13.802 --> 19:16.593
- We should be on our way.
- Yeah, we gotta go. Bye.

19:17.774 --> 19:19.075
Ok.

19:20.771 --> 19:23.289
- Oh.
- Oh. Hello.

19:24.784 --> 19:25.858
Hi.

19:25.897 --> 19:26.904
Lovely day.

19:26.929 --> 19:28.990
Yes, lovely.

19:45.372 --> 19:46.671
<i>Weekend work?</i>

19:46.699 --> 19:47.799
Yeah.

19:47.824 --> 19:49.958
So much for following doctor's orders.

19:50.057 --> 19:53.357
Well, I took that as more
of a recommendation, Doc.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.764
I could give you my usual spiel.

19:56.789 --> 19:59.457
Put your health first,
take time for yourself,

19:59.482 --> 20:00.959
don't burn the candle at both ends,

20:00.984 --> 20:04.358
but I got a feeling
that wouldn't sway you.

20:04.522 --> 20:06.290
You know me well.

20:06.386 --> 20:08.286
Well, I'm gonna say it anyway.

20:08.329 --> 20:10.329
You need to take better
care of yourself, Henry.

20:10.405 --> 20:12.402
All the money in the world
won't do you any good

20:12.427 --> 20:13.881
if you're not here to enjoy it.

20:14.229 --> 20:17.216
I'm sure that's sage advice.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.850
Tomorrow.

20:18.959 --> 20:21.304
Tomorrow I will take some time.
How's that?

20:21.964 --> 20:23.266
Sure.

20:25.534 --> 20:28.925
You know, if you ever wanna
talk about anything, Henry,

20:29.037 --> 20:30.824
my door is always open.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.667
Hungry?

20:51.957 --> 20:53.463
A little.

20:55.014 --> 20:57.590
I had the kitchen prepare
some food before we left.

20:57.919 --> 21:00.427
You really do think of everything.

21:01.585 --> 21:02.636
Coffee?

21:02.668 --> 21:04.068
Thank you.

21:10.247 --> 21:12.230
You're thinking of
little Jack, aren't you?

21:12.730 --> 21:16.565
I am. I'm also just
wondering about tonight.

21:16.639 --> 21:18.612
I'm so curious to see what Mrs.
Woolf is like.

21:18.683 --> 21:20.238
I hear she's quite eccentric.

21:20.324 --> 21:22.825
Well, that often comes
along with great talent.

21:23.345 --> 21:24.945
You should know.

21:27.632 --> 21:29.080
How did you get these tickets?

21:29.105 --> 21:30.437
<i>I heard they were sold out.</i>

21:30.462 --> 21:31.827
I asked around.

21:31.852 --> 21:34.087
Turns out the theatre manager and I

21:34.112 --> 21:35.753
have a mutual acquaintance.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.925
You really went to quite
a bit of trouble.

21:39.586 --> 21:41.586
I really thought you would enjoy it.

21:44.695 --> 21:46.724
I appreciate this, Lucas.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.934
Believe me, the pleasure is all mine.

21:53.507 --> 21:54.730
Macaroon?

21:56.501 --> 21:57.834
Thank you.

22:04.062 --> 22:06.909
Hey. I was just about to
come get you at Opal's.

22:07.363 --> 22:08.453
Did you have fun?

22:08.478 --> 22:09.921
- Yeah.
- Good.

22:09.946 --> 22:11.249
It was great.

22:14.275 --> 22:15.628
What's up?

22:16.559 --> 22:17.897
Uncle Nathan,

22:18.588 --> 22:23.801
if you knew something
that might upset someone

22:24.370 --> 22:28.222
would you tell them or would
you keep it to yourself?

22:31.006 --> 22:34.145
Alright, come on. Let me have it.

22:44.605 --> 22:46.738
This reminds me of a
small hotel in Brussels

22:46.774 --> 22:48.440
where my parents and I once stayed.

22:48.475 --> 22:49.674
It has old-world charm.

22:49.742 --> 22:51.409
- Mmmhmm.
- Good afternoon.

22:51.445 --> 22:52.977
I have reservations under Bouchard.

22:53.012 --> 22:54.139
Welcome, Mr. Bouchard.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.850
- Mrs. Bouchard.
- Oh, no, no. I...

22:55.875 --> 22:58.419
This is Mrs. Thornton and I
have booked a suite for her

22:58.517 --> 23:00.499
and a single room for myself.

23:00.524 --> 23:02.798
Of course. My apologies.

23:04.457 --> 23:06.470
An honest mistake.

23:12.888 --> 23:15.093
<i>Auntie Rosie will be right back.</i>

23:15.118 --> 23:16.774
- Lee?
- Mmmhmm?

23:16.921 --> 23:18.454
I need his toy.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.400
Toy? What toy?

23:20.425 --> 23:21.592
Dog.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.640
Dog? Uh, ok.

23:23.665 --> 23:25.432
Uh... not there...

23:25.457 --> 23:26.864
I know he is tired.

23:26.889 --> 23:29.035
He is rubbing his eyes, his
cheeks are flushed, but...

23:29.381 --> 23:31.567
he just will not go down for a nap.

23:31.592 --> 23:32.730
Dog, Dog, Dog.

23:32.755 --> 23:34.308
I can't find the Dog anywhere.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.833
Well, it's not upstairs.

23:35.858 --> 23:37.625
Well, when was the last time we saw it?

23:38.412 --> 23:39.996
I know we had it in town.

23:40.029 --> 23:41.228
In town.

23:41.264 --> 23:43.072
Did we have it on the way home?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.083
Well? I don't know!

23:45.108 --> 23:46.926
Uh... yes.

23:47.078 --> 23:49.304
No. I don't know.

23:53.069 --> 23:54.317
Ok.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.969
I'll go look. I'll go look.

24:02.797 --> 24:04.736
I'm coming.

24:09.598 --> 24:10.684
Jesse.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.035
Hey, Bill.

24:12.215 --> 24:13.414
Getting settled?

24:13.444 --> 24:14.704
I think so.

24:14.729 --> 24:18.119
Yeah. I noticed you didn't move
very much from your old place.

24:18.307 --> 24:20.731
Well, I like to travel light.

24:20.756 --> 24:22.745
There's no need for that,
there's plenty of room.

24:22.770 --> 24:25.270
I know, but Clara likes
to keep a tidy house

24:25.306 --> 24:27.824
and this place is perfect
without any of my stuff.

24:27.849 --> 24:29.428
It would just be in the way.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.132
It takes some getting used to.

24:31.157 --> 24:34.850
Yeah. And I just don't
wanna mess anything up.

24:48.658 --> 24:50.083
Hey, Ned?

24:50.108 --> 24:52.758
You didn't happen to see a little
stuffed toy anywhere, did you?

24:52.783 --> 24:54.594
Not that I can recall.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.281
I was in here earlier with little Jack.

24:56.306 --> 24:58.408
His favourite toy. I've
looked everywhere for it.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.720
Say no more. Kids his
age are particular.

25:00.745 --> 25:02.178
But what does it look like?

25:02.223 --> 25:06.220
Um, it was like this little
fluffy felty purple puppy thing?

25:06.245 --> 25:07.906
- Lee?
- Yeah.

25:07.931 --> 25:09.366
Phone call. It's Rosemary.

25:09.391 --> 25:11.302
Uh, ok. Thank you, Florence. Thank you.

25:14.455 --> 25:17.009
- <i>Rosie?</i>
- Lee! Did you find it?

25:17.034 --> 25:18.071
<i>No.</i>

25:18.096 --> 25:19.884
Did you look in your office?

25:19.909 --> 25:21.931
<i>Yes, of course I tried my office.</i>

25:21.956 --> 25:23.993
<i>And the livery and the
boardwalk, you name it.</i>

25:24.018 --> 25:25.836
Well, keep looking!

25:25.861 --> 25:27.609
Sweetheart, I don't know
where else to look.

25:30.714 --> 25:32.347
<i>Just find it!</i>

25:32.549 --> 25:33.882
I- I will.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.287
I'll see what we have in the back.

25:38.590 --> 25:39.989
Thank you.

25:51.471 --> 25:54.261
Looks like you've chopped
enough wood for two winters.

25:58.493 --> 26:00.660
I guess you heard about
Elizabeth and Lucas.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.751
Yep.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.671
It's just a reading.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.109
I wouldn't bill it up more than that.

26:08.678 --> 26:10.077
I'm not.

26:10.159 --> 26:12.155
You brought it up, not me.

26:12.645 --> 26:13.991
So it doesn't bother you then...

26:14.016 --> 26:15.790
No, of course not. Why
would it bother me?

26:15.844 --> 26:17.355
They're free to do whatever they want

26:17.380 --> 26:18.712
or go wherever they want.

26:19.257 --> 26:21.497
You just suddenly have
the urge to chop wood?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.978
What're you getting at here?

26:23.003 --> 26:24.836
Just making conversation.

26:25.111 --> 26:26.678
Well, I'm a little busy.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.215
Well, fair enough.

26:33.095 --> 26:34.483
What're you doing?

26:34.608 --> 26:35.804
I'm helping you.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.848
Why?

26:38.387 --> 26:40.889
I just suddenly have
the urge to chop wood.

26:43.729 --> 26:45.429
Thank you, but I don't need your help.

26:45.465 --> 26:47.030
Just like I don't need people in town

26:47.055 --> 26:48.796
walking on eggshells around me, ok?

26:48.821 --> 26:50.321
I'm not making a big deal out of this.

26:50.346 --> 26:52.111
Nobody else has to.

26:52.303 --> 26:54.614
Well, I'm gonna help you anyway.

26:54.639 --> 26:56.839
You know, we can talk.

26:57.031 --> 26:59.274
We can talk about, I don't know...

26:59.299 --> 27:01.626
Baseball! You know I love baseball.

27:01.831 --> 27:03.438
You love baseball too, don't you?

27:03.486 --> 27:05.119
I know you do.

27:05.341 --> 27:07.002
What's your favourite team?

27:09.292 --> 27:11.168
- The Tigers.
- Ah.

27:11.193 --> 27:12.732
See, I'm a Yankee fan.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.647
Favourite player?

27:15.769 --> 27:17.012
Ty Cobb.

27:17.096 --> 27:18.679
Great player.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.515
You know what, though?

27:20.908 --> 27:24.144
He just doesn't have enough power.

27:45.950 --> 27:48.167
You look beautiful.

27:48.817 --> 27:50.383
Thank you.

27:50.910 --> 27:52.589
May I?

28:04.113 --> 28:05.769
Shall we?

28:12.433 --> 28:14.998
Alright, well what about some broccoli?

28:15.023 --> 28:17.280
You like broccoli, I think.

28:17.623 --> 28:18.755
No?

28:18.780 --> 28:21.323
Ok, we'll try some peas.
We'll try some peas.

28:21.348 --> 28:23.498
That's right. Your mama
said you love peas.

28:23.523 --> 28:25.056
Shall we try the peas?

28:25.113 --> 28:26.873
Here come the peas.

28:29.549 --> 28:31.516
Alright, no peas. Ok.

28:31.541 --> 28:33.508
Well, what about the apple?

28:33.533 --> 28:34.866
Do you wanna try a piece of apple?

28:38.235 --> 28:40.728
Little Jack, you must be hungry.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.307
You've barely eaten anything.

28:43.907 --> 28:45.996
Alright, I'm really not
supposed to do this,

28:46.021 --> 28:50.273
but would a sugar cookie make you happy?

28:51.489 --> 28:53.370
Oh, Uncle Lee is here!

28:53.395 --> 28:55.729
I think he has something for you.

28:55.831 --> 28:57.354
You have something for him?

28:57.379 --> 28:59.114
Not exactly.

29:00.175 --> 29:01.579
That's a duck.

29:01.604 --> 29:03.285
I know. That's all Ned had.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.443
What do you think?

29:05.468 --> 29:07.101
Hmm? What do you think?

29:07.503 --> 29:08.787
Duck!

29:08.812 --> 29:10.152
Yeah! Duck!

29:10.177 --> 29:12.089
- Yes, it's a duck!
- Quack, quack!

29:12.114 --> 29:14.273
It's a...

29:15.832 --> 29:17.031
Alright.

29:17.069 --> 29:18.143
So...

29:18.168 --> 29:19.634
No duck.

29:19.696 --> 29:20.828
Hmm.

29:20.853 --> 29:22.053
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:29.091 --> 29:30.436
Thank you.

29:33.527 --> 29:35.184
May I show you the wine list, sir?

29:35.209 --> 29:38.028
Let's start with a bottle
of the Chateau De l'Orange.

29:38.301 --> 29:39.700
That sounds lovely.

29:39.797 --> 29:41.531
The '95 if you have it.

29:41.556 --> 29:42.889
Of course, sir.

29:44.005 --> 29:45.270
Champagne?

29:45.295 --> 29:47.661
Well, I figure we have
plenty to celebrate.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.853
I can't believe we just
met Virginia Woolf.

29:49.966 --> 29:51.715
You two had quite the conversation.

29:51.740 --> 29:53.317
I talked her ear off, didn't I?

29:53.342 --> 29:54.607
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

29:54.663 --> 29:56.329
You were as thick as thieves.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.457
I honestly can't remember
what I said to her.

30:00.898 --> 30:02.981
Well, what did you think? Of her book?

30:03.014 --> 30:05.047
Oh, I liked it, very much.

30:05.230 --> 30:07.230
Her writing style is so unique.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.814
I think she has a very bright future.

30:08.839 --> 30:09.888
Me too.

30:09.913 --> 30:12.653
And this book felt very different
from her short stories.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.590
The unusual narrative perspectives,

30:14.615 --> 30:17.559
the dream states, the
excitement of youth,

30:17.612 --> 30:19.545
the fear of death.

30:22.075 --> 30:23.149
Sorry.

30:23.191 --> 30:24.325
No.

30:24.419 --> 30:26.784
What did you think of the ending?

30:27.912 --> 30:30.106
To be honest I haven't gotten that far.

30:30.131 --> 30:33.083
Oh. How far did you get?

30:33.921 --> 30:36.503
Actually, I have only
read the first chapter.

30:36.528 --> 30:38.171
Last night.

30:38.343 --> 30:40.210
Oh.

30:40.253 --> 30:43.426
I take it you're a bigger fan
of her short stories then?

30:43.722 --> 30:44.921
No.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.777
Not particularly.

30:48.515 --> 30:53.184
So you bought the
tickets just because...

30:56.018 --> 30:59.858
Yes. Just because.

31:00.977 --> 31:02.277
Perfect.

31:12.077 --> 31:13.163
Bill.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.166
How are the newlyweds?

31:15.765 --> 31:17.919
Well, that's what I need
to talk to you about.

31:18.151 --> 31:19.585
Problems?

31:19.684 --> 31:21.171
I'm not sure.

31:21.706 --> 31:24.675
When Jesse moved in here he
only brought a box and a bag.

31:25.816 --> 31:27.082
Yeah, I noticed.

31:27.107 --> 31:29.346
Well, I found out he
sold a lot of his stuff.

31:29.371 --> 31:31.504
He even gave away his
favourite leather chair.

31:31.529 --> 31:34.252
Did you notice he didn't
even move his boots inside?

31:34.294 --> 31:36.061
I tripped over them this morning.

31:36.086 --> 31:38.276
It just... it doesn't make sense.

31:38.610 --> 31:40.739
There's plenty of room
for his things here.

31:40.764 --> 31:42.109
Yeah.

31:43.947 --> 31:47.515
You know it's a big step, moving
into someone else's home.

31:47.598 --> 31:52.245
And I think maybe he's put you
and this place on a pedestal.

31:52.486 --> 31:55.220
Maybe he's having just a
little trouble fitting in.

31:55.245 --> 31:56.541
Hmm?

31:58.657 --> 32:00.123
Mmmhmm.

32:00.405 --> 32:02.254
This is so good.

32:02.279 --> 32:04.146
These mushrooms are amazing.

32:04.171 --> 32:05.646
And I don't even like mushrooms.

32:05.671 --> 32:07.104
Me neither.

32:08.893 --> 32:10.425
So do you miss it?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.516
Miss what?

32:11.564 --> 32:12.796
This.

32:14.828 --> 32:17.563
You've said that you've lived
a different life in Hamilton.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.205
I'm guessing that that life included

32:20.230 --> 32:22.942
the theatre and fine dining.

32:24.164 --> 32:26.237
I didn't think I missed it.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.615
But after a night like
this it's hard not to.

32:31.023 --> 32:33.353
And now that I have Jack I
really couldn't imagine

32:33.378 --> 32:35.747
raising him anywhere but Hope Valley.

32:37.334 --> 32:38.832
I know what you mean.

32:39.417 --> 32:43.697
If I'm being honest, that's
partly what drove me

32:43.722 --> 32:45.736
to Hope Valley in the first place.

32:46.356 --> 32:50.093
Growing up, travelling,
moving all around,

32:50.271 --> 32:52.517
I really wanted to
find the perfect place

32:52.542 --> 32:56.198
to stop and start a family.

32:58.379 --> 33:01.244
I don't think I've heard you
mention wanting a family before.

33:01.269 --> 33:03.900
Well, I am in no hurry.

33:04.390 --> 33:07.152
My father used to stress the
importance of patience,

33:07.177 --> 33:10.323
especially when it comes
to finding your soulmate.

33:11.481 --> 33:14.850
He courted my mother for five years

33:14.875 --> 33:16.507
before she finally agreed to marry him.

33:16.532 --> 33:17.792
Five years?

33:17.817 --> 33:18.983
What took them so long?

33:19.008 --> 33:20.875
You know life.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.378
Things get in the way.

33:24.143 --> 33:27.214
My father says he always
knew she was the one.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.622
My mother says she got
tired of turning him down.

33:31.035 --> 33:32.678
But she loved him.

33:33.127 --> 33:35.394
I think she just wanted to be sure.

33:38.597 --> 33:42.767
So you plan to be patient

33:44.712 --> 33:46.984
like your father?

33:47.467 --> 33:49.709
I have always had faith
that I would know

33:49.734 --> 33:52.030
the perfect woman for me when I met her.

33:53.445 --> 33:59.289
And I will wait as long as I
have to, to win her heart.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.514
Lee.

34:18.866 --> 34:21.476
I think I finally got him down.

34:21.676 --> 34:22.886
Really?

34:22.911 --> 34:23.915
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:23.940 --> 34:26.036
You're a magician. How did you do it?

34:26.101 --> 34:28.949
Well, we were just reading
and singing lullabies.

34:28.974 --> 34:32.654
I think he finally just gave up.

34:32.819 --> 34:34.185
The poor thing.

34:34.210 --> 34:37.701
I don't think I've ever seen
him quite this fussy before.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.068
Well, I guess I understand.

34:39.092 --> 34:42.672
I mean, his mom's gone for the
first time and we lost his toy.

34:42.697 --> 34:44.337
Oh, I know.

34:44.362 --> 34:47.637
All I know is I'm exhausted
and I'm starving.

34:47.716 --> 34:48.900
I'm gonna make us some dinner.

34:48.926 --> 34:50.239
- No, Lee.
- What?

34:50.264 --> 34:51.309
It's too loud.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.382
I'm gonna make us some
quiet food, you'll see.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.249
Oh.

35:01.394 --> 35:02.399
Ulgh!

35:02.424 --> 35:05.146
Well, he's awake now.

35:05.384 --> 35:08.565
I'll have a grilled cheese
sandwich and some tomato soup.

35:09.139 --> 35:11.036
Coming right up.

35:16.034 --> 35:17.206
This smells so good.

35:17.231 --> 35:18.465
Oh.

35:18.636 --> 35:19.768
Thank you.

35:19.793 --> 35:21.287
You're welcome.

35:26.540 --> 35:29.792
You know, you can put your boots inside.

35:29.963 --> 35:32.340
They're probably pretty cold by morning.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.010
No, they're all muddy.

35:36.336 --> 35:38.336
It's fine. I don't mind.

35:38.949 --> 35:40.180
Oh.

35:42.734 --> 35:44.623
- Bon apetit.
- Bon apetit.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.401
I saw you with Kevin earlier.

35:51.622 --> 35:53.856
Your chair was up on the wagon.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.466
Yeah. I gave it to him.

35:59.973 --> 36:02.370
But you said you love that chair.

36:02.883 --> 36:08.083
I do, but there's not really
much room here for it.

36:09.195 --> 36:12.029
And besides, you know the
back rest, it's all ripped.

36:12.845 --> 36:14.177
It's fine.

36:25.941 --> 36:27.060
Morning, Kevin.

36:27.288 --> 36:28.488
Morning.

36:28.513 --> 36:30.685
Jesse told me that he gave
you his leather chair.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.701
That's right. I even
offered to buy it from him

36:32.726 --> 36:34.985
but he said he didn't need it anymore.

36:35.619 --> 36:37.488
Did he give you anything else?

36:39.733 --> 36:41.265
Puppy!

36:41.290 --> 36:42.522
I know, sweetheart.

36:42.547 --> 36:44.209
We'll find that sneaky little Dog.

36:44.234 --> 36:46.420
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

36:46.445 --> 36:48.332
Is that enough walking for one day?

36:48.809 --> 36:50.585
There we go.

36:53.175 --> 36:56.685
Oh, it sounds like
Carson's hard at work.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.551
Ma, ma, mummy! Right there!

36:59.613 --> 37:00.913
Yes.

37:00.967 --> 37:03.292
Would you like to say
hello to Doctor Shepherd?

37:03.317 --> 37:05.339
- Let's go.
- Ok, let's go.

37:08.444 --> 37:09.631
Knock, knock.

37:09.656 --> 37:11.670
- Hey.
- Good morning.

37:11.904 --> 37:13.436
How's the little guy?

37:19.393 --> 37:24.506
Uh, can you just keep typing
for one second for me, please?

37:25.018 --> 37:26.216
Yeah.

37:29.197 --> 37:30.957
<i>Mummy!</i>

37:31.682 --> 37:33.628
I think it's the typewriter.

37:33.653 --> 37:35.067
It reminds him of...

37:35.092 --> 37:36.097
Elizabeth!

37:36.122 --> 37:38.475
Yes!

37:38.500 --> 37:39.779
What are you doing?

37:39.850 --> 37:41.343
You've got your work cut out for you.

37:41.368 --> 37:42.462
Why's that?

37:42.487 --> 37:44.216
I made a new fishing lure.

37:44.241 --> 37:46.640
Those fish won't be able to resist.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.598
<i>Really?</i>

37:50.319 --> 37:51.786
What's the hold up?

37:58.531 --> 38:00.821
Come on, Uncle Nathan.

38:07.821 --> 38:09.829
I can't believe this is working.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.204
No, Lee.

38:14.229 --> 38:15.283
Keep going.

38:15.308 --> 38:16.339
My hand is cramping.

38:16.364 --> 38:17.563
Type!

38:23.487 --> 38:25.721
Come in. Please!

38:26.210 --> 38:27.609
Mummy!

38:27.634 --> 38:28.666
Hello!

38:28.691 --> 38:30.056
Welcome home!

38:30.467 --> 38:32.068
Hello!

38:32.093 --> 38:34.297
Thank you so much for watching him.

38:34.322 --> 38:35.328
Oh!

38:35.353 --> 38:36.421
How was he?

38:36.446 --> 38:38.900
Uh... he was a dream.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.462
- <i>Just a dream.</i>
- You were?

38:40.487 --> 38:42.660
Mummy missed you, my sweet little man.

38:42.685 --> 38:44.573
He missed you, too.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.702
One thing.

38:48.438 --> 38:49.971
We lost Dog.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.759
Oh. Well, that's alright.

38:51.784 --> 38:53.184
I'm sure he'll turn up somewhere.

38:53.263 --> 38:56.584
Should we go get a snack?
Would you like that, huh?

38:56.747 --> 38:58.546
Thank you so much
again, I appreciate it.

38:58.571 --> 39:01.172
I owe you one.

39:01.197 --> 39:02.696
Wait. Uh, Lee?

39:02.721 --> 39:03.821
Mmmhmm?

39:03.951 --> 39:05.040
- Just...
- Oh, yeah.

39:05.065 --> 39:07.393
Ok. Sorry. Of course.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.096
Did you have fun?

39:10.135 --> 39:11.758
I wouldn't know where to start.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.405
Oh, no. Not good?

39:13.430 --> 39:15.397
Oh, Rosemary, it was...

39:16.440 --> 39:17.839
It was perfect.

39:20.179 --> 39:22.977
Well, you're going to have
to give me more than that!

39:23.002 --> 39:25.113
We'll talk, later.

39:25.801 --> 39:26.825
<i>Bye, Lee.</i>

39:26.850 --> 39:28.651
- Bye, Elizabeth.
- Bye, bye.

39:28.676 --> 39:30.967
- Bye, Little Jack.
- Bye bye.

39:36.344 --> 39:39.711
Well, we did it.

39:40.146 --> 39:41.340
Did we?

39:46.447 --> 39:49.054
Wait, what is...

39:57.864 --> 39:59.592
What are you up to?

39:59.617 --> 40:00.950
Nothing.

40:03.212 --> 40:04.483
Hey.

40:04.545 --> 40:06.378
That's my chair.

40:07.569 --> 40:09.033
How did you...?

40:09.095 --> 40:15.566
And your clock, your lamp,
and your boot rack.

40:17.410 --> 40:19.744
And there are some
other things upstairs.

40:22.194 --> 40:24.857
I gave all this stuff away.

40:24.882 --> 40:27.551
And I talked everyone
into giving it back.

40:30.496 --> 40:33.592
I didn't realize how
hard it would be for you

40:33.617 --> 40:35.308
to move into this house.

40:35.938 --> 40:40.441
I know that it's only temporary
but while we're here

40:40.807 --> 40:44.025
I want to make it our house.

40:44.787 --> 40:48.388
And that means that
your things belong here

40:48.416 --> 40:50.699
just as much as mine.

40:55.097 --> 40:56.747
Thank you.

41:17.935 --> 41:19.668
It's quiet.

41:23.286 --> 41:24.691
Hmmm.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.116
I miss having him here, too.

41:37.977 --> 41:39.772
What do you think we want today?

41:39.797 --> 41:42.043
Apples or pears?

41:42.441 --> 41:44.627
You want both, don't you?

41:44.780 --> 41:46.170
Don't you?

41:47.577 --> 41:48.965
Hi, Allie.

41:49.224 --> 41:50.657
Hi Nathan.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.342
Hi, Mrs. Thornton.

41:52.434 --> 41:54.067
Hi, Jack.

41:55.264 --> 41:56.803
Come on, Uncle Nathan.

41:56.828 --> 41:59.475
You promised we'd get some ice cream.

42:02.262 --> 42:03.928
Welcome back.
