00:19.019 --> 00:23.357
Oh, you look like you're
coming from a wedding.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.566
Was it a nice one?

00:24.650 --> 00:28.946
Uh, it's a long story,
and I don't mean to be rude,

00:28.946 --> 00:31.532
but I really don't
feel like talking about it.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.745
It all started when the
bride asked to see me...

00:39.206 --> 00:40.707
Wow.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.252
Okay, don't
sugarcoat it, Mosby.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.462
Just give it
to me straight, okay?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.256
How bad is Barney
freaking out right now?

00:47.256 --> 00:48.966
Oh, he's fine.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.843
No, I'm serious.
He's totally fine.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.302
I have a better
tie at home!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.972
It's cornflower blue!

00:54.972 --> 00:58.642
You may rest assured, Barney
Stinson is absolutely 100%

00:58.642 --> 00:59.977
going through
with this wedding.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.312
Okay.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.064
Good news.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.150
Um, just one
small issue, uh...

01:08.193 --> 01:10.404
I can't go through
with this wedding.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.920
Okay, calm down, everyone feels this way
on their wedding day.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.672
- It'll pass.
- No. It's more than that.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.550
I'm having a
serious crisis.

01:32.718 --> 01:36.013
And I wonder if it would be
hard to climb out that window.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.890
Uh, climbing out's easy.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.600
Climbing in's
the real challenge.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.851
Oh, right.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.352
It's the same window,
isn't it?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.478
Yeah.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.815
<i>That story
transpired in May of 2012.</i>

01:46.899 --> 01:50.194
<i>As you may recall, Lily and
Marshall were gloriously happy</i>

01:50.194 --> 01:52.738
<i>having just welcomed
your cousin Marvin.</i>

01:52.738 --> 01:55.157
<i>While Barney and Quinn
were gloriously happy</i>

01:55.157 --> 01:57.201
<i>having just gotten engaged.</i>

01:57.201 --> 02:00.120
<i>And Robin, well...</i>

02:00.204 --> 02:01.747
Ah, got it!

02:01.747 --> 02:05.083
Man, that sum'bitch had
been in there since breakfast!

02:05.167 --> 02:08.337
Robin: one,
poppy seed: zero.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.630
Heck, this calls
for some champagne.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.714
I think there's
some in the fridge.

02:10.714 --> 02:11.882
We'll get it.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.675
We're-We're totally not gonna
go have sex in the kitchen,

02:13.759 --> 02:15.677
- if that's what you're thinking.
- Aw, we're not?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.221
No, no, we are.
I already took off your bra.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.514
Oh!

02:20.390 --> 02:22.643
Hey, are you guys sure
you can handle champagne?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.603
You haven't slept
in like a week.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.771
We should just
call it a night.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.106
Oh, I see what
this is about.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.400
You feel weird
because Barney's engaged.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.485
What?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.903
No. Of course not.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.863
And I will tell you
why it's not weird.

02:34.947 --> 02:35.948
What's not weird?

02:35.948 --> 02:38.200
- The fact that Barney's engaged.
- Barney's engaged?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.868
Heck, this calls
for some champagne.

02:39.952 --> 02:40.953
I think there's
some in the fridge.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.539
Oh, my God, why don't you
both just admit it.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.874
You're deliriously exhausted.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.001
We're fine!
- Really?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.712
We're not gonna be the kind
of people who have a baby

02:50.796 --> 02:53.215
- and become total zombies.
- Yes, Robin.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.633
We're not gonna be
the kind of people

02:54.633 --> 02:57.261
that have a zombie
and become total babies.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.179
Okay, well,
what I was saying is...

03:08.063 --> 03:09.356
Do you understand?

03:09.356 --> 03:10.732
Yes! God, yes!

03:10.816 --> 03:13.944
You are preaching
to the choir, sister.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.821
Whew!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.030
- Hey.
- So...

03:17.114 --> 03:20.242
I am thinking
about my bridal party

03:20.242 --> 03:22.703
and, uh, I don't have
a lot of girlfriends.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.829
I mean,
I have work friends,

03:23.829 --> 03:25.080
but I worked at a strip club

03:25.080 --> 03:26.164
and I know they'll
just complain

03:26.248 --> 03:29.668
about any bridesmaid's dress
that has a front, so...

03:29.668 --> 03:32.171
would you guys
be my bridesmaids?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.255
- I'd be honored.
- Yes!

03:33.255 --> 03:35.424
Of course.
- Not you, Marshall.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.342
- But, yay, thank you!
- Oh.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.844
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.596
It's gonna be
so much fun.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.307
Yeah, now it's weird.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.725
What's weird?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.060
Me being
Quinn's bridesmaid.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.146
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, sweetie.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.647
She probably won't
even ask you.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.940
She just did.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.192
And we both said yes.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.028
Heck, this calls
for some champagne.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.362
I think there's
some in the fridge.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.657
<i>Meanwhile,
I was also gloriously happy,</i>

04:00.741 --> 04:03.035
<i>driving off into the sunset
with Victoria,</i>

04:03.035 --> 04:05.746
<i>who left her fianc√© Klaus
at the altar for me.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:07.331
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

04:07.331 --> 04:09.791
I wonder if Klaus
found your note yet.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.876
My note?

04:10.876 --> 04:14.087
Yeah, you know, the "I'm leaving
you at the altar" note.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.924
Is that a thing?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.968
When you leave someone at the
altar, you always leave a note.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.178
It's common courtesy.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.056
I think common courtesy went
out the window when I did.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.808
Look, when Stella
left me at the altar,

04:26.892 --> 04:28.477
at least I got an explanation.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.313
I mean, that note is
what keeps you sane.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.733
You read it, you re-read it,
you memorize it,

04:34.733 --> 04:37.236
you sleep with it,
you sniff it

04:37.236 --> 04:38.695
because it still
kind of smells like her,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.197
and then, finally...

04:40.197 --> 04:42.074
you let it go...

04:42.074 --> 04:43.951
tied to a brick,
right through her perfect

04:43.951 --> 04:45.661
little suburban bay window.

04:46.912 --> 04:50.165
- I'll just text him.
- You're leaving a note.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.335
So, Barney and I have
already disagreed

04:53.335 --> 04:54.795
on a few
of the wedding details.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.421
I want to go
with a buffet,

04:56.505 --> 04:59.132
and he wants to ride down the
aisle on a grizzly bear.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.177
He'll be wearing a tux.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.596
Fine, fine, I'll settle
for a panda bear,

05:04.680 --> 05:06.181
but you have
to call my tailor.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.267
He'll be furious
about the switch.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.852
Hey, Barney, uh...

05:09.852 --> 05:11.228
we've gotta talk.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.107
Um, Quinn just asked me
to be one of her bridesmaids.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.110
Isn't she even a little weirded
out that you and I used to date?

05:18.110 --> 05:21.196
Quinn doesn't have
a jealous bone in her body.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.282
She rolls with
the punches.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.616
- She...
- Doesn't have a clue.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.243
No, she does not.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.744
Okay.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
Okay.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.207
"Klaus, there is
no easy way to tell you

05:32.291 --> 05:34.209
'why I won't be
marrying you today.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.420
'Have a great
summer, Victoria."

05:38.088 --> 05:39.089
That's it?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.508
No, no, we gotta
do this right.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.177
Well, you can't write it.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.221
One look, it's gonna be obvious
it's a guy's handwri...

05:46.305 --> 05:47.973
Oh no, we're good.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.560
Okay, fine,
you write, I'll advise.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.022
- "Klaus."
- Just "Klaus"?

05:55.022 --> 05:58.108
Come on, give it some heart,
the poor guy.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.319
"Dear sweet Klaus..."

06:00.319 --> 06:01.862
"Sweet?" What, are you still
in love with this jerk?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.655
I'm doing this on my own.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.660
I'm sorry, I just...

06:08.744 --> 06:11.205
you know,
I feel bad for the guy.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.208
I'm stealing the greatest girl
in the world away from him.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.211
You're not stealing me.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.837
I'm choosing you.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.929
Because you are loving...

06:26.929 --> 06:29.139
and you are caring...

06:29.223 --> 06:32.434
and you are going to
go deliver this note.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.144
Wait, you want me
to go in there?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.813
It took everything
I had to climb out

06:36.897 --> 06:38.065
that church window today.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.610
and if I have
to go back in there,

06:42.611 --> 06:44.363
I'm not sure
I can do it again.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.751
It has to smell like you.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.635
So Quinn has no idea
that we used to date?

07:06.635 --> 07:07.928
None whatsoever.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.847
Okay, Barney,
think this through.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.850
Do you really want to spend the
rest of your life with Quinn...

07:12.850 --> 07:14.977
- Oh, God, you have a point.
- Haven't gotten to it yet.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.564
Of course. Continue.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.358
Do you really want to spend the
rest of your life with Quinn

07:21.358 --> 07:23.861
and keep this secret?
I mean, she's gonna find out.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.113
Quinn's not gonna find out
because I've destroyed

07:26.113 --> 07:28.907
every piece of evidence that
you and I were ever a couple.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.367
That's ridiculous.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.244
You couldn't have
gotten rid of all of it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.669
You replaced me with a tiger.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.337
I couldn't completely
get you out of that one.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.505
Had to get creative.

07:43.589 --> 07:47.593
Well, I'm glad that deleting
our entire time together

07:47.593 --> 07:49.052
was so easy for you.

07:49.136 --> 07:52.097
But I guarantee you: Quinn is
gonna find out eventually.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.265
No, she won't.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.558
I just need your help.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.684
Yours, too.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.394
I know you guys are out of it,
but you have to promise

07:57.394 --> 07:58.729
not to tell Quinn, okay?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.189
Tell Quinn what?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.482
- Exactly.
- No, she's really asking.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.859
Tell Quinn what?

08:09.448 --> 08:13.035
Oooh...

08:23.045 --> 08:24.671
- Can't climb the drainpipe.
- What?

08:24.755 --> 08:26.590
When I was in fourth grade,
I couldn't climb the rope

08:26.590 --> 08:28.342
in gym class and all the other
kids made fun of me,

08:28.342 --> 08:29.718
even though
it wasn't my fault.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.887
I had to go after
Efthimios Papajapoulos.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.515
The rope was slick
with lamb grease!

08:34.515 --> 08:37.100
Okay, so just walk
in the front door

08:37.184 --> 08:38.435
and act like you belong.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.479
Here. Here's the key
to the dressing room.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.905
Can I help you?

08:49.905 --> 08:52.324
Hi.
I'm the church handyman.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.160
I'm here to fix
the broken thing.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.620
It's busted.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.372
The bride is
taking a "schnooze."

08:58.372 --> 09:01.333
She asked me to stand watch
so that no one disturbs her.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.584
I'll be quick.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.044
You will be dead.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.963
I used to wrestle
in Leipzig.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.965
You know what?
A note's redundant.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.508
You're not there.
He gets it.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.802
No, you were right,
I have to leave a note.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.095
It's common courtesy.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.638
Well, it's not
gonna be possible

09:14.638 --> 09:17.015
with Andrea the Giant
standing guard up there.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.059
Oh, right, Klaus's sister.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.769
It's too bad
Barney's not here.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.146
Man, he lives
for bridesmaids.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.815
Right, but he's not.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.526
And it's not like he could
seduce Uta over the phone.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.737
Challenge accepted!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.823
Honey, it's not cheating
if it's on the phone, right?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.533
- Say what now?
- Quinn's on board!

09:34.533 --> 09:35.868
Text me her number!

09:35.868 --> 09:39.121
You filthy, disgusting man!

09:39.121 --> 09:43.250
But yes, I will do that to
myself at your instruction.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.669
Let me find a broom closet.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.298
Oh, ja, good.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.520
I did it. I did it!

10:03.604 --> 10:04.730
You're amazing.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.481
Let's get out of here.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.071
I left the car keys
in the dressing room.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.658
Pretty sure the door
locked behind me.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.375
I found it kind of insulting
that Barney doesn't

10:25.459 --> 10:27.127
think we can
keep this secret.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.214
I mean, yeah, Marvin's
keeping us up all night.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.550
But he's still the prettiest
little girl in the city.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.012
Baby, did you
just hear yourself?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.848
You said, "Prettiest
little girl in the city."

10:40.974 --> 10:42.267
I think you meant "country."

10:42.351 --> 10:44.144
Yeah.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.812
I mean, what
does Barney think?

10:45.896 --> 10:47.773
We're just gonna blurt out
that he used to date...

10:47.773 --> 10:48.941
Shh!

10:48.941 --> 10:51.985
Oh... that was close.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.822
Quinn could've heard
us through the...

10:55.906 --> 10:57.282
Good catch!

10:57.366 --> 11:01.119
I almost just blurted out
that Barney used to date Robin!

11:01.203 --> 11:02.204
Barney used
to date Robin?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.376
When did you get in here?

11:07.376 --> 11:09.419
Like, ten minutes ago
when you said,

11:09.503 --> 11:12.422
"Hey Quinn, let's all go hang
out in Marvin's room."

11:12.506 --> 11:15.801
<i>Aufwiedersehen, fraulein.</i>

11:15.801 --> 11:18.387
You know, I hate
to perpetuate the stereotype,

11:18.387 --> 11:22.850
but German female wrestlers from
Saxony are just begging for it.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.101
You dated Robin?

11:25.102 --> 11:26.603
<i>Verdammt!</i>

11:31.108 --> 11:33.402
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I'll tell you everything.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.696
- The whole story.
- Fine. You have one minute

11:35.696 --> 11:37.114
before I walk out that door.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.658
Um, it's, uh, kind
of a long story, Quinn.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.368
Gonna take a bit little
longer than a minute.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.870
52 seconds.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.038
Seven years ago, when Marshall
and Lily got engaged,

11:45.122 --> 11:47.165
Ted saw Robin across a crowded
room, and I said, "Oh, yeah,

11:47.249 --> 11:49.084
"you just know she likes it
dirty," but Ted really liked her

11:49.168 --> 11:50.586
so we played
"Have you met Ted?"

11:50.586 --> 11:52.171
They went to dinner, he walked
her home, shoulda kissed her,

11:52.171 --> 11:53.964
didn't, lame, so he stole
a smurf penis, went back

11:53.964 --> 11:55.257
to her place, should've kissed
her, didn't, lame.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.717
He threw three parties,
they kissed on the roof,

11:56.717 --> 11:58.177
but decided to be friends, lame,

11:58.177 --> 11:59.511
then Ted wanted to
take Robin to a wedding,

11:59.595 --> 12:00.971
she couldn't go, he went alone
and met Victoria,

12:00.971 --> 12:03.056
didn't kiss her either, lame,
not a great closer, Ted,

12:03.140 --> 12:04.516
but he finally kissed her,
they started dating,

12:04.600 --> 12:06.476
she went to Germany, Ted kissed
Robin, lost Victoria,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.478
Ted did a rain dance, got Robin,
Ted and Robin broke up,

12:08.562 --> 12:10.439
Robin moved to Brazil,
came back with a Latin stud,

12:10.439 --> 12:12.482
Ted got jealous, got a tramp
stamp, not really relevant

12:12.566 --> 12:13.567
to the story I just like
mentioning that

12:13.567 --> 12:15.611
as much as possible, I hooked up
with Robin, Ted and I stopped

12:15.611 --> 12:18.363
being friends, Ted got hit
by a bus, we made up...

12:18.447 --> 12:20.449
Robin and I started dating,
I got fat, her hair fell out.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.159
We broke up, Robin dated Don,
I dated Nora,

12:22.159 --> 12:23.660
cheated on her with Robin,
I dumped Nora,

12:23.744 --> 12:24.870
Robin dated Kevin,
but not for long,

12:24.870 --> 12:26.330
and then I met you and you took
my grandpa's watch

12:26.330 --> 12:27.414
but I fell in love
with you anyway,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.291
and you let me fart in front of
you and I asked you to marry me

12:29.291 --> 12:30.918
and you said yes and we came
over here to meet little Marvin

12:30.918 --> 12:32.002
and that's everything!

12:32.002 --> 12:34.046
Also I went on the Price Is
Right and won a dune buggy.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.633
Goodbye, Barney.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.760
Good... I j...

12:41.053 --> 12:42.930
She lets you fart
in front of her?

12:44.223 --> 12:45.516
Barney...

12:45.516 --> 12:47.809
you go get that girl.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.868
Oh, God!

13:04.952 --> 13:06.370
You cannot tell anyone
that you saw me.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.621
I cannot get married today!

13:07.621 --> 13:10.040
- Klaus?
- Oh, I'm a mess.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.001
I threw up in the cloakroom,
I blamed a small child.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.837
I cannot get married.
I left a note.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.338
Good for you.
Not everyone thinks of that.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.298
Who doesn't leave a note?
It's common courtesy.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.925
Thank you!

13:19.925 --> 13:21.677
- Do you have the time?
- Um...

13:21.677 --> 13:23.178
yeah, it's 20 after 7:00.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.263
Ah, <i>sehr gut.</i>

13:24.263 --> 13:26.181
I can still make
the 8:05 back to the city.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.850
<i>Auf wiedersehen!</i>

13:27.850 --> 13:29.476
<i>And suddenly it hit me:</i>

13:29.560 --> 13:32.604
<i>a way to absolve
Victoria of any blame.</i>

13:32.688 --> 13:36.233
<i>All I had to do
was climb that drainpipe.</i>

14:01.049 --> 14:03.677
What? No, Klaus, no.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.275
<i>Mach schnell,</i> sleepyhead,
it's time to...

14:19.568 --> 14:21.028
I know about you and Barney.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.697
Who told her?

14:23.697 --> 14:24.948
You guys did.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.283
God, go to sleep.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.493
Okay, no one is going anywhere

14:28.577 --> 14:31.371
until we find out who told you.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.456
Look...

14:32.456 --> 14:35.000
there is nothing going on
between me and Robin.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.293
And why should I believe that?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.462
Well, for starters, I have a boyfriend.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.089
No, Robin, you don't
have to do this.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.841
There've been enough lies.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.259
I'm not lying.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.636
His name is Nick.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.137
I didn't want to jinx it
by telling everyone,

14:47.221 --> 14:49.473
so I just told Marshall and Lily.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.099
You can tell 'em, guys.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.271
We were just talking
about this earlier today.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.482
Okay, well,
what I was saying is...

15:01.652 --> 15:04.905
I have no desire to get Barney
back because I'm with Nick now

15:04.905 --> 15:07.950
and, well, I don't want to be crude,

15:07.950 --> 15:11.787
but I want to spend
all day licking his abs.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.330
Do you understand?

15:13.330 --> 15:16.875
- Yes! God, yes!
- You are preaching to the choir, sister.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.587
I stand by it.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.089
Guys, it's okay.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.967
You're new parents.
You just need to get some sleep.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.426
We're fine!

15:28.971 --> 15:30.639
This is hard, guys.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.516
Really hard.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.439
Oh, God! Stay with me.
Stay with me.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.570
Go get your baby. Yeah.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.906
Look, it doesn't matter
that you have a boyfriend.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.658
I'm always gonna
be wondering if you secretly

15:49.658 --> 15:51.618
still have feelings for Barney.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.745
I don't care who this guy is.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.041
Okay, we're good.

15:59.334 --> 16:03.172
Okay, well I'm glad I left
work early for this.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.257
Robin, maybe later we can
discuss the meaning

16:05.257 --> 16:07.509
of the word "emergency"
and the phrase

16:07.593 --> 16:08.969
"Trapped under a car."

16:08.969 --> 16:10.846
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.895
You know he has chicken legs.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.772
Little tiny chicken legs.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.649
You guys saw those, right?

16:22.733 --> 16:24.067
Honey, it's not cheating
if I lie down on the bar

16:24.151 --> 16:26.445
and let Nick do a shot
from my belly button, right?

16:26.445 --> 16:28.655
- Say what now?
- Barney's on board!

16:28.739 --> 16:30.199
Nick, hold on!

16:33.785 --> 16:36.371
- Thanks for your help today.
- Yeah, sure.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.376
Although, it, uh, kind of
sucked seeing how easy it was

16:41.460 --> 16:44.963
for you to throw away everything
from our relationship.

16:45.047 --> 16:48.175
I... I could never do that.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.809
622 West 14th Street.

17:02.731 --> 17:06.235
<i>And so, Victoria and I
were back where we started.</i>

17:06.235 --> 17:08.779
<i>But there was something
I couldn't get off my mind...</i>

17:13.158 --> 17:14.660
I'll be right back.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.083
Uh, excuse me.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.001
Oh, hey, it's you.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.462
<i>Ja,</i> okay, I'm not sure
what kind of vibe

17:25.546 --> 17:27.464
I was giving off before,
but I am not interested

17:27.548 --> 17:30.175
- in your schnitzel, okay?
- No, no, no, no, no... God, no.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.511
I-I just have
one quick question:

17:32.511 --> 17:35.556
Victoria seems like a great girl.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.974
Why wouldn't you
want to marry her?

17:36.974 --> 17:40.018
Ach, okay,
Victoria is <i>wunderbar.</i>

17:40.102 --> 17:42.354
I'm sorry, <i>wunderbar</i> is the
German word for wonderful.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.398
- Yeah, no, I know.
- Oh, you speak German?

17:47.818 --> 17:49.778
No... no, no, no...

17:49.862 --> 17:51.321
no, just-just-just the one word.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.824
Oh. Oh.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.701
Ah, okay, Victoria.

17:55.701 --> 17:59.830
There is a word in German:
<i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.</i>

17:59.830 --> 18:02.165
And the closest
translation would be...

18:02.249 --> 18:05.002
"Lifelong Treasure of Destiny."

18:05.002 --> 18:07.379
And Victoria is <i>wunderbar,</i>

18:07.379 --> 18:10.465
but she is not my <i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.</i>

18:10.549 --> 18:12.759
She is my <i>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand,</i>

18:12.843 --> 18:15.179
you know?

18:15.179 --> 18:17.806
You know <i>wunderbar</i> but you don't know
<i>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?</i>

18:17.890 --> 18:20.142
That is something we
learn in kindergarten.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.352
I'm sorry, "kindergarten"
is the German word for...

18:22.436 --> 18:24.396
- No, no, I know that one.
- Oh, okay.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.939
But you don't know
<i>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?</i>

18:26.023 --> 18:29.109
You are maddeningly inconsistent.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.736
It means...

18:30.736 --> 18:33.989
"the thing that is almost
the thing that you want...

18:36.033 --> 18:38.076
"but it's not quite."

18:38.160 --> 18:40.829
<i>Das ist</i> Victoria to me.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.664
How do you know she's not
<i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz?</i>

18:42.748 --> 18:45.834
I mean, maybe as the years
go by, she'll get

18:45.918 --> 18:48.170
<i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz-ier.</i>

18:48.170 --> 18:50.297
Oh, <i>nein, nein, nein.</i>

18:50.297 --> 18:52.841
<i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz is not something</i>

18:52.925 --> 18:55.010
that develops over time.

18:55.010 --> 18:57.763
<i>It is something that
happens instantaneously.</i>

18:59.848 --> 19:01.308
<i>It courses through you</i>

19:01.308 --> 19:04.394
<i>like the water of a river
after a storm...</i>

19:05.479 --> 19:08.565
<i>filling you and emptying
you all at once.</i>

19:17.741 --> 19:19.535
<i>You feel it
throughout your body...</i>

19:21.954 --> 19:23.080
<i>in your hands...</i>

19:23.080 --> 19:25.290
<i>Coming up only</i>

19:25.374 --> 19:26.416
<i>...in your heart...</i>

19:26.500 --> 19:29.503
<i>To show you wrong</i>

19:29.503 --> 19:31.505
<i>...in your stomach...</i>

19:33.507 --> 19:35.008
<i>And to know you is hard</i>

19:35.092 --> 19:38.053
<i>...in your skin...</i>

19:38.053 --> 19:40.889
Of course you feel it in your <i>Schlauchmachendejungen.</i>

19:40.973 --> 19:42.015
Pardon my French.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.893
Have you ever felt
this way about someone?

19:47.271 --> 19:48.856
Yeah, I think so.

19:48.856 --> 19:51.984
If you have to think about it,
you have not felt it.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.820
And you're absolutely sure
you'll find that someday?

19:54.820 --> 19:56.029
Of course.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.323
Everyone does eventually.

19:58.407 --> 20:02.494
You just never
know when or where.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.079
<i>And he was right.</i>

20:04.079 --> 20:06.331
<i>Unfortunately, the "when"
of it was still</i>

20:06.415 --> 20:08.125
<i>a little ways down the road.</i>

20:11.170 --> 20:13.630
<i>But the "where" of it?</i>

20:13.714 --> 20:16.758
<i>Really too late to call</i>

20:17.926 --> 20:20.179
<i>So we wait for</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:25.893
<i>Morning to wake you
is all we got</i>

20:25.893 --> 20:28.103
Yeah, there's your change.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.022
Oh, and don't
forget your guitar.

20:33.025 --> 20:38.655
<i>To know me
as hardly golden</i>

20:42.367 --> 20:47.539
<i>Is to know me all wrong,
they warn</i>

20:51.710 --> 20:55.923
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>
