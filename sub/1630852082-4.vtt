01:43.120 --> 01:45.440
<i>I need to talk to Ellis.
We're goin' to Manchester.</i>

01:45.440 --> 01:46.760

01:56.600 --> 01:58.040
<i>So, as the figures suggest,</i>

01:58.040 --> 02:01.120
<i>this is one of the most potentially

02:01.120 --> 02:04.120

02:08.200 --> 02:10.000
<i>Er, yeah, no,
it's definitely something</i>

02:12.960 --> 02:14.760

03:29.160 --> 03:32.680

03:32.680 --> 03:34.560

04:18.920 --> 04:20.480
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

04:20.480 --> 04:22.000
<i>Did you speak to him?</i>

<i>Couldn't place it.
Was it posh?</i>

04:40.360 --> 04:41.920
<i>Not posh as such.</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:49.640
<i>This has been helpful. Thanks.</i>

04:52.320 --> 04:55.600
<i>You know why I came back later
and wanked on that kid's grave?</i>

04:59.960 --> 05:01.480
<i>Because I was ashamed.</i>

05:02.640 --> 05:04.360
<i>I was ashamed
that I was scared of him.</i>

05:04.360 --> 05:06.000
<i>And I don't fuckin' scare easy,</i>

05:06.000 --> 05:08.400
<i>but there was something about him,
it really shit me up.</i>

05:09.520 --> 05:13.440
<i>So I went back to prove that
I was the baddest bastard around.</i>

05:18.120 --> 05:21.600
<i>You don't get the notion

05:25.000 --> 05:27.320

<i>George, did you care

05:38.480 --> 05:40.040
<i>'Yeah, I did.'
Why didn't you tell me?</i>

05:40.040 --> 05:42.400
<i>I mentioned it
to every fucker in sight,</i>

05:42.400 --> 05:44.160
<i>but nobody would listen.</i>

05:44.160 --> 05:46.480
<i>Have you still got

05:49.960 --> 05:52.120

06:27.360 --> 06:28.840
<i>Look!</i>

06:28.840 --> 06:33.320
<i>This guy here, talking to Ellis,
that is Confectioner.</i>

06:33.320 --> 06:34.720
<i>The confessional urge is strong.</i>

06:34.720 --> 06:37.200
<i>A visit to the victim's grave
often scratches that itch.</i>

06:37.200 --> 06:39.920
<i>You as well?
That's how they caught Robert Ellis.</i>

06:39.920 --> 06:41.680
<i>Aye, wanking over the kid's grave!</i>

06:41.680 --> 06:43.240
<i>And you say he's not guilty!</i>

06:43.240 --> 06:46.600
<i>Masturbating over Nula's grave is
one thing, killing her is another.</i>

06:46.600 --> 06:48.480
<i>The timeline isn't right.
You know the story,</i>

06:48.480 --> 06:51.400
<i>the public's bloodlust
discounts the requirement of logic.</i>

06:51.400 --> 06:54.720
<i>So, you advocate
a massively expensive operation</i>

06:54.720 --> 06:58.640
<i>that snares the passing pervert
instead of the multiple murderer!</i>

06:58.640 --> 07:01.560
<i>Do you not see the flaw
in your own logic?</i>

07:01.560 --> 07:04.480
<i>Ellis crossed paths
with plenty of folk at the grave.</i>

07:04.480 --> 07:05.960
<i>AND he confessed!</i>

07:05.960 --> 07:08.520
<i>Parka Man, there, is Confectioner,
I am telling you.</i>

07:19.560 --> 07:20.720
<i>He spoke to Ellis?</i>

07:20.720 --> 07:23.400
<i>It's in the file.
How did they not follow up on it?</i>

07:23.400 --> 07:24.800
<i>TOAL TUTS</i>

07:26.680 --> 07:30.760
<i>I can't afford to sanction CCTVing

07:34.240 --> 07:35.920
<i>You have to, boss.</i>

07:36.880 --> 07:38.200
<i>You have to.</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:07.960
<i>Gonna get you.</i>

<i>We are gonna go after him

08:36.640 --> 08:39.240
<i>We're setting up surveillance
on Britney's funeral.</i>

08:39.240 --> 08:42.000
<i>The date is gonna be released
in the national press.</i>

08:42.000 --> 08:43.880
<i>Confectioner will come to us.</i>

08:43.880 --> 08:46.320

08:50.080 --> 08:52.120
<i>A favour. Those driving skills.</i>

08:52.120 --> 08:53.920
<i>As you can see, he moves around.</i>

08:53.920 --> 08:56.280
<i>Most recently sighted
in Leeds and Birmingham.</i>

08:56.280 --> 08:59.040
<i>He generally stays off
motorways and tries...</i>

08:59.040 --> 09:00.240
<i>LIFT BELL PINGS</i>

09:13.520 --> 09:16.040
<i>Thanks. If I'd missed this,

09:16.040 --> 09:18.720
<i>I didn't even know you had
a girlfriend till last night.</i>

09:19.760 --> 09:22.040

09:22.040 --> 09:23.920

09:23.920 --> 09:25.640
<i>SHE LAUGHS</i>

09:26.760 --> 09:28.880
<i>I split from Keith 18 months ago.</i>

09:28.880 --> 09:30.360
<i>We were living together.</i>

09:30.360 --> 09:31.920
<i>Could he not have come with you?</i>

09:31.920 --> 09:34.160
<i>He didn't wanna leave Dundee.
HE SCOFFS</i>

<i>SHE LAUGHS,

09:40.280 --> 09:44.920
<i>I was on a low for a while.
Tried to party my way through it.</i>

09:44.920 --> 09:49.200
<i>It didn't work.
So I went to therapy.</i>

09:51.720 --> 09:53.440
<i>Did you find that useful?</i>

09:53.440 --> 09:55.120
<i>It was the best thing

09:56.600 --> 09:58.520
<i>I really lucked out.</i>

09:58.520 --> 10:01.760

10:03.640 --> 10:05.920

10:08.800 --> 10:10.440

10:11.480 --> 10:15.520
<i>Are you serious?</i> <i>Well, unlike

<i>Your friend Estelle?
Yeah.</i>

12:27.480 --> 12:30.200
<i>They're trying to talk her
into having a threesome.</i>

12:31.360 --> 12:33.760
<i>I think there could be
a history of it, though.</i>

12:33.760 --> 12:35.960
<i>I've discovered
there's a few other girls</i>

12:35.960 --> 12:38.360
<i>who've left the company

12:38.360 --> 12:43.760
<i>But management insist on this really
complicated grievance procedure.</i>

12:43.760 --> 12:46.040
<i>And it's traumatic.
But if she doesn't come forward,</i>

<i>then... there's nothing they can do.</i>

12:52.560 --> 12:55.440

15:44.560 --> 15:48.040
<i>FOURNIER SCREAMS WILDLY</i>

15:48.040 --> 15:49.600
<i>GILLMAN ROARS</i>

15:49.600 --> 15:51.400
<i>FOURNIER WAILS</i>

15:51.400 --> 15:53.080
<i>Get in there!</i>

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
<i>GILLMAN GRUNTS</i>

15:56.280 --> 15:57.560
<i>FOURNIER SCREAMS</i>

16:00.560 --> 16:02.280
<i>FOURNIER SOBS</i>

16:05.080 --> 16:07.280
<i>Well, that's got shot
of the tatty water.</i>

16:09.800 --> 16:11.440
<i>SIREN WAILS</i>

16:11.440 --> 16:12.840
<i>LEBLANC GROANS WEAKLY</i>

16:15.520 --> 16:17.080
<i>You were pretty tidy back there.</i>

16:18.840 --> 16:21.760
<i>It was quite exciting.
HE LAUGHS</i>

16:21.760 --> 16:24.600
<i>Gillman, eh?
What the fuck is he up to?</i>

16:24.600 --> 16:27.680
<i>Thankfully, that fossil
remains a mystery to me.</i>

17:11.480 --> 17:13.160
<i>A junior employee has alleged</i>

17:13.160 --> 17:15.680
<i>that Mark and Estelle
have been harassing her.</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:17.160
<i>Sexually.</i>

17:17.160 --> 17:18.920
<i>HE SIGHS</i>

17:18.920 --> 17:20.840
<i>Will she go on the record?</i>

17:22.360 --> 17:25.200
<i>You know I can't investigate
any alleged sexual harassment</i>

17:25.200 --> 17:27.120
<i>unless she comes forward.</i>

17:27.120 --> 17:30.120
<i>Miles, something isn't right here.</i>

17:30.120 --> 17:31.680
<i>You know yourself</i>

17:31.680 --> 17:35.720
<i>we have had more than our fair share
of women leaving the company.</i>

17:35.720 --> 17:37.960
<i>I hate to say it,
but I'm actually starting to think</i>

17:37.960 --> 17:40.360
<i>that there is a culture of silence
at Dunedin Power.</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:41.680
<i>Now, look, Trudi.</i>

17:41.680 --> 17:44.160
<i>We take complaints
like this very seriously,</i>

17:44.160 --> 17:46.520
<i>but this girl, this Carly,</i>

17:46.520 --> 17:49.040
<i>she'll need to follow
the correct grievance procedure.</i>

17:49.040 --> 17:51.680
<i>People's lives and reputations
are at stake here.</i>

17:51.680 --> 17:53.200
<i>Do you wanna ruin people</i>

17:53.200 --> 17:57.000
<i>over something that could
turn out to be a misunderstanding,</i>

17:57.000 --> 17:58.560
<i>or even a joke?</i>

18:22.280 --> 18:25.200
<i>Louis.</i> <i>Hi.
I was worried I'd miss you.</i>

18:25.200 --> 18:26.720
<i>Well, I'm here.</i>

18:26.720 --> 18:30.480
<i>To say goodbye
to a trusted colleague is sad,</i>

18:30.480 --> 18:33.440
<i>but if that person
is also a beautiful woman,</i>

18:33.440 --> 18:37.680
<i>such farewells become deep wounds
etched into the soul of a man.</i>

18:38.920 --> 18:43.840
<i>Well, I'm sure the charms of Paris
will help you get over it.</i>

18:50.360 --> 18:52.920
<i>Goodbye, Louis.</i>

18:52.920 --> 18:54.360
<i>Au revoir, Amanda.</i>

18:57.080 --> 18:58.880
<i>I will miss you.</i>

19:10.880 --> 19:12.600
<i>How's the recovery?</i>

19:12.600 --> 19:15.680
<i>Some pain still,
but he hit nothing serious.</i>

19:15.680 --> 19:17.720
<i>I was lucky, you know.</i>

19:20.240 --> 19:22.040
<i>Georges Fournier.</i>

19:23.600 --> 19:26.440
<i>A young man with such
disfiguring wounds.</i>

19:26.440 --> 19:29.400
<i>No longer handsome, but interesting.</i>

19:29.400 --> 19:31.760
<i>I hope he gets the requisite
romantic attention</i>

19:31.760 --> 19:33.880
<i>in your prison system.</i>

19:33.880 --> 19:35.880
<i>A cold-blooded killer.</i>

19:35.880 --> 19:38.400
<i>True, but not your bon-bon man.</i>

19:39.720 --> 19:41.440
<i>But you'll find him soon.</i>

19:41.440 --> 19:43.400
<i>Optimism is the key, my friend.</i>

19:43.400 --> 19:46.960
<i>I admire your ability
to be so upbeat.</i>

19:46.960 --> 19:48.840
<i>The shit we see.</i>

19:48.840 --> 19:51.360
<i>The evil bastards
that we have to find.</i>

19:51.360 --> 19:53.920
<i>Such bastards, we get to catch them
and lock them away</i>

19:53.920 --> 19:55.560
<i>so they hurt no more.</i>

19:55.560 --> 19:59.840
<i>One day, we create a beautiful
garden where no weeds can flourish!</i>

19:59.840 --> 20:03.280
<i>But until, we can make
the best fertiliser,</i>

20:03.280 --> 20:06.680
<i>we have to pull them up by hands!</i>

20:06.680 --> 20:10.240
<i>Right, le frog, let's get you
down to Waverley Station.</i>

20:10.240 --> 20:11.280
<i>Get you to fuck.</i>

20:15.080 --> 20:17.240
<i>Keep the ladies in your life
happy, Raymond.</i>

20:17.240 --> 20:18.920
<i>That makes for good life!</i>

20:18.920 --> 20:22.200
<i>Is that a French philosophy,
or a specifically LeBlanc one?</i>

20:22.200 --> 20:25.880
<i>Well, in France, we say,
"If your woman's happy,</i>

20:25.880 --> 20:28.640
<i>"then make love to her
and she is for staying happy.</i>

20:28.640 --> 20:32.000
<i>"If she is sad, make love to her
and she will be happy."</i>

20:32.000 --> 20:34.360
<i>See, that's all right
for yous Frenchie bastards!</i>

20:34.360 --> 20:37.240
<i>My missus would think
I was radge if I tried all that!</i>

20:37.240 --> 20:40.280
<i>Well, women are like
other partners, Douglas.</i>

20:40.280 --> 20:41.680
<i>You have to talk to them.</i>

20:41.680 --> 20:43.360
<i>Nah, she won't talk to me!</i>

20:43.360 --> 20:45.880
<i>She thinks I won't open up
and discuss things.</i>

20:49.000 --> 20:51.920
<i>So long, Louis. I need to head off.</i>

20:51.920 --> 20:55.000
<i>Ah. Some poor, unfortunate paedo
needing rescuing</i>

20:55.000 --> 20:57.400
<i>from his cruel incarceration, aye?</i>

21:40.320 --> 21:43.760
<i>Ray, it's a police department,
it's not a one-man crusade.</i>

21:43.760 --> 21:45.720
<i>You stand and fall as a team.</i>

21:45.720 --> 21:47.720
<i>Aye, and what happens
if some of your teammates</i>

21:47.720 --> 21:50.520
<i>are more concerned about their
pensions than catching monsters?</i>

21:50.520 --> 21:51.960
<i>Hang on, you were the one that said</i>

21:51.960 --> 21:53.840
<i>that you have to
think like a system to beat it.</i>

21:53.840 --> 21:55.920
<i>This is different.
How?</i>

21:55.920 --> 21:58.600
<i>How is it different? If people
aren't pulling their weight,</i>

21:58.600 --> 22:01.080
<i>then you have to do something
to expose 'em.</i>

22:01.080 --> 22:03.480
<i>The difference here
is that I'm dealing with coppers</i>

22:03.480 --> 22:06.640
<i>who could teach career criminals
a thing or two about subterfuge.</i>

22:07.600 --> 22:10.280
<i>Ray, baby,</i>

22:10.280 --> 22:14.200
<i>you have got to stop
taking the whole weight of the world</i>

22:14.200 --> 22:15.480
<i>onto your shoulders.</i>

22:17.480 --> 22:19.560
<i>You're a good man.</i>

22:19.560 --> 22:21.160
<i>You care.</i>

22:21.160 --> 22:22.320
<i>But...</i>

22:23.920 --> 22:27.080
<i>..I really need for you
to care about me, too.</i>

23:35.400 --> 23:37.040
<i>It's not natural, is it?</i>

23:40.520 --> 23:42.320
<i>Natural?</i>

23:43.960 --> 23:45.400
<i>What happened to us?</i>

23:46.880 --> 23:50.840
<i>At what point did we go from
killing for survival</i>

23:50.840 --> 23:52.520
<i>to killing for kicks?</i>

24:04.560 --> 24:06.240
<i>This isn't healthy.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:13.400
<i>Ray...</i>

24:15.600 --> 24:17.040
<i>..come back to bed.</i>

24:44.440 --> 24:47.640
<i>DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES</i>

24:50.080 --> 24:51.400
<i>You still here?</i>

24:53.400 --> 24:54.520
<i>What's all this?</i>

24:54.520 --> 24:57.160
<i>Er, well, this is the HS2 route.</i>

24:57.160 --> 24:58.600
<i>You and your trains.</i>

24:58.600 --> 25:02.240
<i>No, Ray. Confectioner.</i>

25:03.480 --> 25:05.120
<i>Everything happens within an hour</i>

25:05.120 --> 25:08.920
<i>of these three HS2 hubs of London,
Birmingham and Leeds.</i>

25:13.160 --> 25:15.120
<i>But why Edinburgh?</i>

25:15.120 --> 25:17.800
<i>The high speed train
isn't going as far as Scotland.</i>

25:24.240 --> 25:26.320
<i>Maybe in his mind it is.</i>

25:30.160 --> 25:33.160
<i>OK, folks. So we've had
a bit of a breakthrough. Stuart.</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:40.560
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:40.560 --> 25:41.960
<i>OK.</i>

25:41.960 --> 25:44.280
<i>I was thinking about trains.</i>

25:44.280 --> 25:46.360
<i>Fucking you and your toy trains!</i>

25:46.360 --> 25:47.920
<i>Wee saddo.</i>

25:49.800 --> 25:54.120
<i>London, Birmingham and Leeds are all
hubs on the HS2 rail development.</i>

25:54.120 --> 25:56.240
<i>These are all the girls
that have gone missing,</i>

25:56.240 --> 25:58.640
<i>or been killed, near the HS2 route.</i>

25:58.640 --> 25:59.840
<i>They could be linked.</i>

25:59.840 --> 26:04.000
<i>Also, prior to this, two girls,
Holly Wolf and Jessica Barnes,</i>

26:04.000 --> 26:07.720
<i>vanished in Ashford and Ebbsfleet.
That's nowhere near the HS2 route.</i>

26:07.720 --> 26:10.560
<i>But it is near the HS1 route,
the Eurostar one.</i>

26:10.560 --> 26:13.240
<i>It could be someone who
previously worked on that project.</i>

26:13.240 --> 26:15.680
<i>Let's get the names
of all the contractors</i>

26:15.680 --> 26:17.760
<i>who worked on the HS projects.</i>

26:17.760 --> 26:21.160
<i>Get onto their HR department
for a list of the mobile employees,</i>

26:21.160 --> 26:23.480
<i>where they live, what they drive.</i>

26:23.480 --> 26:27.560
<i>Maybe a salesman? They get around.
They're always fucking perverts.</i>

26:27.560 --> 26:30.120
<i>Is that right? All salesmen
are perverts, are they?</i>

26:30.120 --> 26:33.520
<i>If Stuart's right, then Confectioner
could be responsible</i>

26:33.520 --> 26:35.400
<i>for even more killings
than we thought.</i>

26:35.400 --> 26:38.200
<i>There's 15 lassies here,
all unsolved cases.</i>

26:38.200 --> 26:41.120
<i>London, Birmingham, Leeds,
with the odd foray up here.</i>

26:41.120 --> 26:43.080
<i>One at the time of Britney's death.</i>

26:44.080 --> 26:45.320
<i>Keep digging.</i>

26:45.320 --> 26:48.800
<i>What, and we're sticking with the
Thomas The Tank Engine angle, aye?</i>

26:52.120 --> 26:53.280
<i>GIRL: Pass it!</i>

26:53.280 --> 26:55.160
<i>Pass the ball.</i>

26:55.160 --> 26:57.080
<i>Shoot! Shoot!</i>

26:58.200 --> 26:59.960
<i>Aw!</i>

27:02.440 --> 27:04.080
<i>Get the ball, then, Kylie.</i>

27:20.160 --> 27:22.920
<i>Ray Lennox?
My 11 o'clock appointment, right?</i>

27:22.920 --> 27:24.200
<i>I'm Sally Hart.</i>

27:24.200 --> 27:26.320
<i>I just popped out
for some milk and stuff.</i>

27:26.320 --> 27:29.040
<i>I live in the upstairs flat
and use this one for work.</i>

27:38.480 --> 27:40.120
<i>Just through here.</i>

27:53.240 --> 27:56.280
<i>Take a seat, or lie out on the couch
if you'd prefer.</i>

28:03.920 --> 28:05.480
<i>So, Ray...</i>

28:08.000 --> 28:10.240
<i>..you're a detective, right?</i>

28:10.240 --> 28:12.400
<i>Aye, in serious crime.</i>

28:14.000 --> 28:15.280
<i>That sounds serious.</i>

28:19.520 --> 28:24.440
<i>So... I'm meant to spill
my darkest, deepest secrets</i>

28:24.440 --> 28:26.200
<i>and we work through them?</i>

28:29.240 --> 28:32.400
<i>No. It's for you to decide
what affects your life</i>

28:32.400 --> 28:35.160
<i>and what you feel comfortable
talking about.</i>

28:44.520 --> 28:46.320
<i>Are you OK with that?</i>

28:46.320 --> 28:50.400
<i>Aye. I mean, there's not a lot makes
me uncomfortable outside of the job.</i>

28:52.560 --> 28:56.600
<i>So how much time do you spend
at work, or thinking about work?</i>

28:58.480 --> 28:59.600
<i>Well...</i>

29:00.840 --> 29:03.120
<i>You never have to stop
picking up the rubbish and...</i>

29:04.480 --> 29:06.800
<i>..it causes considerable pain
to everyone.</i>

29:15.160 --> 29:20.240
<i>So, I'm selling the business
and I'm going with Alfonso to Italy.</i>

29:20.240 --> 29:23.440
<i>If it's true love,
and it is true love,</i>

29:23.440 --> 29:25.760
<i>you cannae waste your life
on games, right?</i>

29:27.040 --> 29:28.320
<i>Right.</i>

29:51.400 --> 29:52.680
<i>SHE TUTS</i>

29:52.680 --> 29:54.320
<i>SHE SIGHS</i>

30:07.600 --> 30:11.000
<i>Gin and bitter lemon. I minded!</i>

30:12.040 --> 30:13.880
<i>Thanks.</i>

30:13.880 --> 30:15.760
<i>Right, I wanted to have
a proper talk with you,</i>

30:15.760 --> 30:18.200
<i>like really open up about
where it is we're going wrong.</i>

30:18.200 --> 30:20.160
<i>I've had a right good think
about things,</i>

30:20.160 --> 30:23.040
<i>and I can see what it is I'm doing
that might be a wee bit off.</i>

30:23.040 --> 30:26.720
<i>I ken I can go off on one without
giving you a word in edgeways.</i>

30:26.720 --> 30:28.320
<i>Well, that's...
I don't want it now.</i>

30:28.320 --> 30:31.240
<i>What I'm trying to say is,
I ken I've got my faults.</i>

30:31.240 --> 30:32.480
<i>I mean, I work funny hours,</i>

30:32.480 --> 30:34.200
<i>so you're bound to be saying
to yourself,</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:36.960
<i>"Is he off pumping
some dirty wee whore,</i>

30:36.960 --> 30:38.960
<i>"or has he got some
daft wee bird in tow?</i>

30:38.960 --> 30:41.680
<i>"Cos he doesn't seem interested
in giving me the message any more."</i>

30:41.680 --> 30:45.080
<i>Well, I ken that women can
go through a crisis of confidence</i>

30:45.080 --> 30:46.440
<i>when they get to a certain age.</i>

30:46.440 --> 30:49.440
<i>I mean, it wasn't that long ago when
you were wearing short skirts,</i>

30:49.440 --> 30:51.560
<i>even though it seems like
fuckin decades.</i>

30:51.560 --> 30:53.480
<i>I, mean, you must look
at younger birds and say,</i>

30:53.480 --> 30:57.200
<i>"They've got it,
I've just no any more."</i>

30:57.200 --> 30:59.640
<i>I...</i> <i>It's the mutton
dressed as lamb syndrome,</i>

30:59.640 --> 31:01.840
<i>it's bound to affect
a woman's confidence,</i>

31:01.840 --> 31:02.960
<i>it stands to reason.</i>

31:02.960 --> 31:06.440
<i>Well, I just want you to ken
that I totally get it.</i>

31:08.800 --> 31:11.760
<i>There. That wisnae as hard
as I thought it was gonna be,</i>

31:11.760 --> 31:14.520
<i>and it seems to have
cleared the air.</i>

31:14.520 --> 31:17.200
<i>So, are you sorted?
You comin' home, darling'?</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:28.960
<i>I want a divorce.</i>

31:31.440 --> 31:34.000
<i>The lawyer's papers are in there.</i>

31:41.000 --> 31:43.240
<i>She's fucking nuts, by the way.</i>

31:43.240 --> 31:45.320
<i>Her ma's side,
radge, the lot of them!</i>

31:45.320 --> 31:46.920
<i>I knew it would come out!</i>

31:48.680 --> 31:50.760
<i>What you looking at?</i>

31:50.760 --> 31:52.040
<i>KNOCK AT DOOR</i>

31:53.080 --> 31:56.440
<i>Carly, er, thanks
for coming to see me.</i>

31:58.600 --> 32:00.240
<i>Do you wanna take a seat?</i>

32:08.000 --> 32:09.600
<i>I need you to come forward.</i>

32:11.000 --> 32:13.200
<i>Look, I have to leave.</i>

32:20.560 --> 32:22.080
<i>You're resigning?</i>

32:22.080 --> 32:23.240
<i>No.</i>

32:24.200 --> 32:25.640
<i>No way.</i>

32:25.640 --> 32:27.280
<i>I've thought about it, and...</i>

32:29.440 --> 32:31.400
<i>..I'm going nowhere here.</i>

32:40.000 --> 32:41.360
<i>DOOR CLOSES</i>

32:50.560 --> 32:53.640
