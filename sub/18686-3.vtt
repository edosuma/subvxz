WEBVTT

00:05.086 --> 00:06.796
Previously on Beyond.

00:06.797 --> 00:09.259
Your son was unconscious
for 12 years.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.471
- You're in the hospital, son.
- You're safe.

00:11.472 --> 00:13.633
I know who you are.
I know what you can do.

00:13.634 --> 00:16.186
I'm not who you think I am!

00:16.187 --> 00:17.517
Can you confirm
where you were last night?

00:17.518 --> 00:20.191
- Is this about Kevin?
- What happened outside the bar?

00:21.312 --> 00:23.103
Discretion is how
this organization

00:23.104 --> 00:24.404
continues to operate.

00:24.405 --> 00:26.236
Frost wanted to see what the
kid can do and now we know.

00:26.237 --> 00:27.647
Who is that?
He looks familiar.

00:27.648 --> 00:29.819
That's Kevin's brother... the
psycho that put you in a coma.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.282
Hi, I'm Jamie.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.116
Holden!

00:36.117 --> 00:37.577
They're coming for you, Holden.

00:37.578 --> 00:40.210
Holden! Holden!

00:40.211 --> 00:42.001
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

00:42.002 --> 00:43.163
What?

00:43.164 --> 00:44.164
The other night

00:44.165 --> 00:45.926
you said we lived
a life together.

00:47.007 --> 00:48.008
Where?

00:54.435 --> 00:56.976
Look, it's not
an easy explanation.

00:56.977 --> 00:58.228
Okay, well...

00:58.229 --> 01:00.520
I've come all this way.

01:00.521 --> 01:01.812
Humor me.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.065
While you were in your coma,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.238
your mind traveled.

01:08.239 --> 01:09.989
"Traveled"?

01:09.990 --> 01:11.781
You left your physical body

01:11.782 --> 01:13.453
here in Fort Reed

01:13.454 --> 01:16.366
and your mind traveled
to another world.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.119
And you're telling me
I did all this

01:19.120 --> 01:21.501
while I was unconscious?

01:21.502 --> 01:23.873
I don't expect
you to understand.

01:23.874 --> 01:25.795
No, I... I understand. I just...

01:25.796 --> 01:27.707
don't believe you.

01:27.708 --> 01:30.049
Well, you're here now,

01:30.050 --> 01:31.971
so there must be
some part of you

01:31.972 --> 01:34.424
- that wants to...
- I want it to stop.

01:34.425 --> 01:35.476
All of it.

01:37.308 --> 01:39.140
Before someone else gets hurt.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.358
Hey, Kevin.
Where have you been?

01:48.359 --> 01:50.320
I can't explain right now, baby.

01:50.321 --> 01:51.861
- I think I'm being followed.
- What?

01:51.862 --> 01:54.444
What? Where are you? Why would
anybody be following you?

01:54.445 --> 01:57.157
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Look, I can't explain right now, okay babe?

01:57.158 --> 01:58.618
I just need you
to pack a bag, okay?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.659
Just pack a bag.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.080
No, Kevin. I'm not
going anywhere

02:01.081 --> 02:02.792
- until you tell me
what's going on.

02:02.793 --> 02:04.295
Kevin?

02:05.586 --> 02:06.837
Kevin?

02:08.048 --> 02:11.511
What you're experiencing are
physical manifestations

02:11.512 --> 02:15.014
of your mind simply trying
to remember those 12 years.

02:15.015 --> 02:17.517
Nothing about that was simple.

02:17.518 --> 02:18.928
More English.

02:18.929 --> 02:21.261
You've heard of PTSD.

02:21.262 --> 02:22.352
Soldiers returning home

02:22.353 --> 02:24.644
feeling the effects
of recent trauma.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.227
Like in your case,
it's brought on by stress.

02:27.228 --> 02:30.360
How many soldiers can burn houses
to the ground with their minds?

02:30.361 --> 02:34.444
Your emotional responses
are a bit more... dramatic.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.155
Yeah.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.448
Your mind wants you to remember.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.041
Your memories are trying
to force their way out.

02:42.122 --> 02:45.205
- But you're stubborn.
- I'm stubborn?

02:45.206 --> 02:48.167
You called me 37 times
over the past 48 hours.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.590
Yeah.

02:53.003 --> 02:54.215
Now you know why.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.928
The key to controlling
these outbursts

02:58.929 --> 03:01.140
is freeing your memory.

03:01.141 --> 03:02.802
At least, that's my best guess.

03:02.803 --> 03:05.145
Your...

03:06.307 --> 03:07.357
We can inject you

03:07.358 --> 03:09.188
with a carefully
synthesized Propranol

03:09.189 --> 03:10.690
and an Anisomycin chaser.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.402
That's funny, it sounded
like you said inject me.

03:12.403 --> 03:14.193
Which will dull the fear
response in your brain

03:14.194 --> 03:16.155
and amplify
your long-term memory.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.407
It's perfectly safe.

03:17.408 --> 03:20.119
No, no way are you
sticking me with that.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.911
I... I don't even know you.

03:21.912 --> 03:24.624
But you do know me.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.955
And until you remember that,

03:25.956 --> 03:27.276
you're still a danger
to yourself.

03:35.135 --> 03:36.136
Shit!

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.441 --> 03:52.231
That's not your call.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.943
You came to me for help.

03:53.944 --> 03:55.945
Because I'm out of my mind.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.117
Because you knew
I could help you.

03:58.118 --> 03:59.949
You just don't understand how

03:59.950 --> 04:01.160
and that's what scares you.

04:01.161 --> 04:03.032
Look, I just need time.

04:03.033 --> 04:05.244
I need to think.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.956
Not too long.

04:06.957 --> 04:09.999
These outbursts,
they could get worse.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.422
What are my options?

04:14.214 --> 04:18.588
Your only option is to trust me.

04:18.589 --> 04:21.220
- I...
- Even though you have no reason to.

04:21.221 --> 04:23.803
Please, just...

04:23.804 --> 04:26.016
don't give me a reason not to.

04:34.855 --> 04:36.697
Hey, um...

04:38.359 --> 04:39.989
Those 12 years,

04:39.990 --> 04:43.784
were they... good?

04:46.327 --> 04:49.329
What you and I had...

04:49.330 --> 04:51.582
was good.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.638
Man, is it good to be back here.

05:08.639 --> 05:11.020
I definitely remember
this place.

05:11.021 --> 05:13.192
I mean, come on.
Look at this. Same table.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.644
Brings back some great
memories, doesn't it?

05:14.645 --> 05:16.646
This was Friday nights for us.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.028
All-you-can-eat pasta,
garlic bread...

05:19.029 --> 05:20.740
- Yeah.
- Then after,

05:20.741 --> 05:23.112
we'd, uh, school Dad
over at the batting cages.

05:23.113 --> 05:24.744
Right. Yeah, I think your memory

05:24.745 --> 05:26.496
of the batting cage is
grossly inaccurate, son.

05:26.497 --> 05:29.659
Your selective memory
is one again second to none.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.001
Slow down there, buddy.

05:32.413 --> 05:34.164
See something you like, Holden?

05:35.165 --> 05:36.716
What? No, I...

05:36.717 --> 05:37.757
For dinner.

05:37.758 --> 05:39.008
What looks good to you?

05:39.009 --> 05:41.260
Right. Uh...

05:41.261 --> 05:45.304
well, it has been 12 years
since my last bacon ravioli.

05:45.305 --> 05:48.177
Dude, that thing was a health
code violation with Parmesan.

05:48.178 --> 05:51.060
They used to pile on
those meatballs. You remember?

05:51.061 --> 05:52.732
Yeah. Oh!

05:52.733 --> 05:54.183
Hey, Dad, tell him about, um...

05:54.184 --> 05:56.025
the meatball grinder
at Sanderson's.

05:56.026 --> 05:57.607
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.860
- Oh, Luke was driving one of those
Drivers Ed cars -Diane, Diane...

06:00.861 --> 06:03.112
And the instructor was
in the front with him

06:03.113 --> 06:04.824
and your dad was in the back,

06:04.825 --> 06:07.787
- you know, as a witness.
- It wasn't just a lesson.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.449
Okay, I was going
for my license...

06:09.450 --> 06:11.491
Okay, it was like
this metamorphosis

06:11.492 --> 06:12.952
- happened within me.
- Oh, yeah.

06:12.953 --> 06:14.203
It was the meatballs.

06:14.204 --> 06:16.295
It was just hanging there

06:16.296 --> 06:18.047
like 90 degree weather.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.338
Like, it's thick.

06:19.339 --> 06:21.130
- Did he pass you?
- Oh, to get some fresh air

06:21.131 --> 06:23.503
back at the DMV.
Hell yeah.

06:23.504 --> 06:25.094
There's a test
you can take, too.

06:25.095 --> 06:27.176
High school equivalency test.

06:27.177 --> 06:28.428
Okay.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.930
He hasn't even passed
the seventh grade yet, Diane.

06:30.931 --> 06:32.512
Which is why he needs
to get back to it.

06:32.513 --> 06:34.474
It's fine. It's a good idea.

06:34.475 --> 06:36.105
Who's he in a race with?

06:36.106 --> 06:37.817
Nobody. It'll be good for him.

06:37.818 --> 06:39.899
I just with you would have
discussed this with me first.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.021
You know, I might have an opinion
as to what's good for him, too.

06:42.022 --> 06:44.113
- Hey, it's okay. Can we order or...
- Why do you question

06:44.114 --> 06:45.985
every single decision?

06:45.986 --> 06:48.027
Because maybe nobody else
ever gets to make one.

06:48.028 --> 06:50.239
Listen, he's gonna get
his diploma, all right?

06:50.240 --> 06:51.831
It's just not gonna
happen before sundown.

06:51.832 --> 06:53.202
Okay, you sit back and watch

06:53.203 --> 06:54.664
while things get done
by somebody else.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.165
This isn't gonna
"get done."

06:56.166 --> 06:57.667
This isn't like a task

06:57.668 --> 06:59.879
like... like picking up
the dry cleaning, all right?

06:59.880 --> 07:01.751
This is gonna take some time.
He's gonna need time...

07:01.752 --> 07:03.042
You don't think
that I don't know this?

07:03.043 --> 07:04.925
Would you both just shut up?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.277
- The hell did you just say?
- Excuse me?

07:12.102 --> 07:14.224
I'm... I'm done.

07:15.816 --> 07:18.018
I'm... I'm done lying.

07:19.059 --> 07:21.111
Lying? About what?

07:27.237 --> 07:30.200
So are you gonna tell him
why you sleep on the couch, Dad?

07:34.374 --> 07:36.496
Holden, your mom and I,
we've been separated.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.708
For over a year.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.379
That doesn't make any sense.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.922
I... I mean, we've all
been home together. I...

07:42.923 --> 07:44.925
I... I know, son, but...

07:46.346 --> 07:48.298
I actually have
my own place now.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.012
We thought it would be best

07:53.013 --> 07:56.305
for you to come home
to a stable family environment

07:56.306 --> 07:57.436
when you woke up.

07:57.437 --> 07:59.859
To make you feel comfortable.

07:59.860 --> 08:02.312
How long were
you all gonna pretend?

08:09.069 --> 08:11.030
Great. Um...

08:11.031 --> 08:13.533
so great job
making me feel comfortable.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.744
I feel right at home.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.375
- Holden. Holden, come on.
- No, I hope this

08:16.376 --> 08:18.578
doctor-prescribed reunion
wasn't too hard for you all.

08:18.579 --> 08:19.999
Holden.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.832
Holden, wait.

08:24.965 --> 08:26.717
The hell were you thinking?

08:46.907 --> 08:48.278
No.

08:56.246 --> 08:58.207
Come on!

08:58.208 --> 09:00.329
Don't do this to me.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.922
Not tonight.

09:46.006 --> 09:47.007
You're losing control.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.299
Fight it.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.927
You should get out
of those clothes.

10:38.518 --> 10:41.261
I mean, you're all wet, so...

10:43.143 --> 10:44.314
I'll get a towel.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.397
Thanks.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.151
Hey, um...

10:52.152 --> 10:55.154
who's that guy I keep seeing
in all the visions?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.078
Your mind is trying to
make sense of a lot of things.

11:05.085 --> 11:06.166
Huh.

11:07.547 --> 11:10.169
The man's getting a habit
of scaring the crap out of me.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.251
Thanks.

11:16.056 --> 11:18.178
I thought having dinner
with my family was bad.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.562
You, uh...

11:23.563 --> 11:26.105
your parents still together?

11:26.106 --> 11:27.858
No.

11:30.110 --> 11:31.230
I... I didn't mean, um...

11:31.231 --> 11:33.572
It's none of my business.

11:33.573 --> 11:35.985
So to control your outbursts,

11:35.986 --> 11:38.367
we need to get you to remember.

11:38.368 --> 11:39.820
You ready?

11:40.871 --> 11:42.701
I'm ready to try.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.916
It seems like Michael
had finally found true love,

11:46.917 --> 11:50.499
but nothing could have prepared
him for true heartbreak.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.171
See? Hear that?

11:52.172 --> 11:54.964
He's been hurt
by past relationships.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.636
You're right. It sounds like
he's done with that now.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.008
No more heartbreak.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.509
Well, he's a software salesman.

12:00.510 --> 12:02.101
He gets paid to sell stuff.

12:02.102 --> 12:03.893
There you go again.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.436
The sales will pick up
soon, honey. I promise.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.521
We got enough for another glass?

12:12.522 --> 12:14.444
Depends how badly you want it.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.890
You could probably use this
more than me, huh?

12:59.990 --> 13:02.862
This bowl represents
the here and now.

13:02.863 --> 13:05.114
The world we currently live in.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.957
That sponge in there is you.

13:07.958 --> 13:11.040
Holden Matthews living
in the here and now.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.042
Did you...

13:13.043 --> 13:14.374
rehearse this?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.126
Of course I did.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.547
When you went into your coma,

13:18.548 --> 13:20.049
the traditional laws
of physics say that

13:20.050 --> 13:22.972
the space, time,
energy, and mass

13:22.973 --> 13:25.184
of Holden Matthews remained

13:25.185 --> 13:28.057
in that bowl for 12 years.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.770
But you're telling me
I... I left that bowl.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.276
The water
in this sponge represents

13:37.277 --> 13:40.529
all the experience you absorbed
from the real world.

13:40.530 --> 13:44.114
Your consciousness,
pain, pleasure.

13:45.495 --> 13:46.616
Love.

13:48.828 --> 13:53.252
Things that the traditional laws
of physics don't account for.

13:53.253 --> 13:56.795
Now your brain, it transferred
all that stored experience

13:56.796 --> 13:57.918
over to here.

14:02.923 --> 14:05.555
This is that other
plane of existence.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.178
Where we met.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.181
I call it the Realm.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.643
"The Realm."

14:14.644 --> 14:17.646
The term came out
of an old medical journal.

14:17.647 --> 14:19.779
Because "Narnia" was taken?

14:21.781 --> 14:24.283
The water I rung
from your sponge swirled

14:24.284 --> 14:26.696
in this muddy pool for 12 years.

14:27.787 --> 14:29.289
Until you woke up.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.583
And your body reclaimed it.

14:39.589 --> 14:41.050
This is you now.

14:41.051 --> 14:43.092
Since you awoke.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.005
Gee, thanks.

14:46.967 --> 14:51.641
What we need to do is isolate
your memories of the Realm...

14:56.016 --> 14:59.688
and once your mind
can make sense

14:59.689 --> 15:01.071
of everything
you've experienced...

15:02.192 --> 15:04.024
I can finally get
a good night's sleep.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.159
Lie on your back.

15:27.547 --> 15:29.049
For luck.

15:43.323 --> 15:45.944
- What is it?
- Nothing. I'm just...

15:45.945 --> 15:49.238
not that crazy about needles.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.912
Would it help
if I count to three?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.996
Actually, yeah. Yeah.

15:58.128 --> 16:01.210
I'm giving you an integrated
stress response inhibitor.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.004
It's been known to boost
memory functions in mice.

16:05.175 --> 16:07.846
But it's been tested
on humans, too, right?

16:07.847 --> 16:09.219
Right.

16:11.051 --> 16:13.142
Just, uh...

16:13.143 --> 16:15.184
just lay back and relax.

16:15.185 --> 16:17.516
And you're gonna count to three?

16:17.517 --> 16:19.058
Yes.

16:19.059 --> 16:20.980
I'll count to three.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.528
Think about the last thing
you remember before your coma.

16:29.529 --> 16:31.660
Just concentrate on that.

16:31.661 --> 16:33.112
The woods.

16:33.113 --> 16:35.324
Good.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.036
Here we go.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.999
One, two...

16:42.292 --> 16:43.963
three.

16:45.175 --> 16:46.295
Follow the light, Holden.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.508
Follow the light.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.218
That was the Realm?

19:42.722 --> 19:44.564
How is that possible?

19:50.109 --> 19:52.271
Try to breathe, Holden.

19:52.272 --> 19:53.693
It's okay.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.076
Drink. It'll help.

19:59.909 --> 20:01.820
Oh, man.

20:01.821 --> 20:04.032
It was like being thrown
into a blender. I...

20:04.033 --> 20:05.664
I saw trees

20:05.665 --> 20:08.997
and this light,
really bright, and then...

20:08.998 --> 20:10.379
and then it'd go away.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.421
You're remembering.

20:12.422 --> 20:14.132
That's good.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.044
That's very good.

20:15.045 --> 20:17.756
If these are memories,
then why am I not younger

20:17.757 --> 20:19.007
like... like a 12-year-old?

20:19.008 --> 20:21.800
Your mind only reflects
the current you.

20:21.801 --> 20:24.052
The current me
feels like I dove headfirst

20:24.053 --> 20:25.685
into an empty swimming pool.

20:26.896 --> 20:29.017
In rare cases, a decreased level

20:29.018 --> 20:31.480
of consciousness
can cause hypothermia.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.112
The bath helps dilate
your blood vessels.

20:34.113 --> 20:37.196
Here I just thought you
wanted to get my shirt off.

20:39.068 --> 20:40.739
Joking.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.453
We'll need a few
additions for next time.

20:48.037 --> 20:50.920
Even sedated,
your body control was...

20:52.251 --> 20:54.834
erratic.

21:00.049 --> 21:01.641
Seriously?

21:05.224 --> 21:07.886
We just didn't know the right
way to go about telling him.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.478
It's okay, Diane.

21:09.479 --> 21:12.060
You knew the split
was gonna hit hard.

21:12.061 --> 21:14.563
I mean, you know,
there isn't a how-to guide

21:14.564 --> 21:16.896
for what you and your
family have been through.

21:19.449 --> 21:22.201
He's home. Thank God.

21:24.704 --> 21:26.205
Oh, it's you.

21:27.747 --> 21:29.869
Warm welcome. Thank you.

21:33.172 --> 21:35.003
Late night for you, Pastor.

21:35.004 --> 21:37.005
I couldn't sleep.

21:37.006 --> 21:40.218
Ian agreed to wait up
for Holden with me.

21:40.219 --> 21:43.301
It's nothing. I offer
my support to the community

21:43.302 --> 21:44.553
in any way I can.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.726
Oh. That's a kind gesture.

21:47.727 --> 21:49.267
Doesn't go unnoticed.

21:49.268 --> 21:52.601
But you'd be wise to remember
that Holden is my son.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.734
And we're perfectly capable
of worrying about him

21:55.735 --> 21:57.736
without your holy blessing.

21:57.737 --> 22:00.109
Of course, Tom.

22:06.536 --> 22:08.116
Hm.

22:08.117 --> 22:11.040
Looks like I was the good luck
charm that brought him home.

22:33.563 --> 22:37.275
What did you do to Holden?

22:37.276 --> 22:39.438
You're referring
to the demonstration

22:39.439 --> 22:41.039
he gave us in the
parking lot that night.

22:44.744 --> 22:46.906
Pretty impressive stuff, right?

22:49.248 --> 22:52.250
First I didn't believe
in my employer's cause.

22:52.251 --> 22:54.913
Another plane of existence,

22:54.914 --> 22:57.205
it sounded like a fairytale

22:57.206 --> 22:59.628
I'd read to my
daughter at bedtime.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.461
But then I forced
your friend's hand.

23:02.462 --> 23:05.174
And wow.

23:06.426 --> 23:09.218
Holden has a gift
and he doesn't even know it.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.101
He will.

23:14.313 --> 23:16.104
Why me?

23:16.105 --> 23:18.146
The misinterpretation
of a command resulted in

23:18.147 --> 23:21.189
you being a witness to something
you should not have seen.

23:21.190 --> 23:24.693
I'm saddled with cleaning it up.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.284
Sorry.

23:26.285 --> 23:28.827
I'm not gonna talk.

23:28.828 --> 23:31.079
I swear.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.121
In that case, I'll be candid.

23:33.122 --> 23:35.243
I hate killing.

23:35.244 --> 23:36.955
Turns my stomach.

23:36.956 --> 23:39.629
Please. My wife.

23:40.630 --> 23:42.090
She's going to give birth

23:42.091 --> 23:44.042
to our first child.

23:44.043 --> 23:46.135
I... I just need to see them.

23:53.553 --> 23:55.433
Only when taken away

23:55.434 --> 23:57.767
does one really know
what he has.

24:03.903 --> 24:06.024
So...

24:06.025 --> 24:07.617
you gonna behave?

24:10.830 --> 24:12.121
Uh-huh.

24:14.123 --> 24:15.745
All right.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.958
Let's take you home.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.608
Hey, Holden.

24:49.609 --> 24:52.030
Jamie! Hey!

24:52.031 --> 24:54.162
What's up?

24:54.163 --> 24:57.205
Sorry about, uh, breaking it off

24:57.206 --> 24:58.246
the other night.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.878
Oh, no.

24:59.879 --> 25:02.000
There were flames.
Wasn't your fault.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.083
Yeah.

25:06.085 --> 25:08.627
So what kind
of a deck do you got?

25:08.628 --> 25:10.759
Uh, I'm looking
for one of the...

25:10.760 --> 25:12.180
A helmet.

25:12.181 --> 25:14.013
These ones too.

25:16.976 --> 25:19.689
Hey, what's your cell?

25:21.230 --> 25:23.642
Um, the phone I have right now

25:23.643 --> 25:25.313
isn't...

25:25.314 --> 25:28.486
Well, look. It's just one
of those temporary ones, so...

25:28.487 --> 25:30.449
Oh, no, here.
Let me.

25:34.153 --> 25:36.244
"You have work to do."

25:36.245 --> 25:37.456
Who's Willa?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.369
My sister.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.123
Oh, I... I didn't know
you and Luke had a sister.

25:45.124 --> 25:49.047
She... likes to be
kept out of the press.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.590
She's shy, so.

25:52.171 --> 25:54.724
She sounds smart.

25:57.436 --> 25:58.977
There.

25:58.978 --> 26:03.182
Now in case this place
spontaneously goes up in flames...

26:04.393 --> 26:06.314
you got my number.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.106
Call me sometime.

26:08.107 --> 26:09.398
I will.

26:12.111 --> 26:14.192
Oh, and, um...

26:14.193 --> 26:17.035
whatever high-flying act
you've got planned,

26:17.036 --> 26:21.000
the ones that actually protect
your skull are just over there.

26:23.042 --> 26:24.292
Right.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.085
Good tip. Thanks.

26:27.296 --> 26:28.467
Yup.

26:32.011 --> 26:33.051
See ya.

26:33.052 --> 26:34.263
Yeah.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.293
He's been asking for you.

27:05.294 --> 27:06.706
Thank you, Daniel.

27:19.308 --> 27:21.100
I'm here.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.023
He's starting to remember.

27:25.024 --> 27:26.935
But it's slow.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.728
Just fragmented memories.

27:29.729 --> 27:31.069
It'll be some time

27:31.070 --> 27:33.151
before he can
make sense of them.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.154
Before he has control.

27:44.043 --> 27:46.044
I'm trying.

27:46.045 --> 27:47.877
So is he.

27:48.998 --> 27:51.961
But I can only go
as fast as he'll let me.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.803
Nothing will distract me
from bringing you home.

28:28.497 --> 28:30.459
How many months is she?

28:32.041 --> 28:34.093
Seven.

28:36.135 --> 28:38.677
Taking you home
to see your family...

28:40.429 --> 28:42.511
seemed like
the right thing to do.

28:48.307 --> 28:50.059
Thank you.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.859
No.

29:03.122 --> 29:04.203
No.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.025
You know, it's
about time, I guess.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.949
No use in pretending anymore.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.281
Gonna leave some tools here

29:43.282 --> 29:45.114
in case your mom needs
help around the house.

29:46.996 --> 29:49.828
Dad, thought
I'd let you know I'm...

29:49.829 --> 29:51.709
I'm heading back.

29:51.710 --> 29:53.962
I got an Econ midterm and...

29:53.963 --> 29:56.175
What happened to
taking the semester off?

29:58.587 --> 30:00.970
School knows what
you're dealing with.

30:02.341 --> 30:04.092
Yeah.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.134
At a certain point,
I need to string together

30:06.135 --> 30:08.977
some life moments
that don't involve the coma.

30:08.978 --> 30:10.889
I know. That's exactly
what Holden's around here doing.

30:10.890 --> 30:12.311
You can help
more than anyone, Luke.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.813
"More than anyone"?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.195
Until a few days ago,

30:17.196 --> 30:19.147
I was just the kid
who visited the hospital,

30:19.148 --> 30:21.740
you know, every week
with you and Mom.

30:24.443 --> 30:26.365
Hand me the impact
wrench, will you?

30:36.085 --> 30:37.625
No, no, not that. Not that.

30:37.626 --> 30:38.836
Come on.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.220
How do you not know
what an impact wrench is?

30:42.171 --> 30:43.632
Holden would know.

30:46.465 --> 30:48.426
He was always pretty good
with this stuff.

30:48.427 --> 30:51.019
Yeah, he never missed chance
to get his hands greasy,

30:51.020 --> 30:52.350
that's for sure.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.562
Look, Luke.

30:54.563 --> 30:58.276
You know, doing projects
and things, that just...

30:58.277 --> 30:59.899
that was never your thing.

31:01.190 --> 31:02.240
That's okay.

31:02.241 --> 31:04.322
Yeah, maybe because
instead of inviting me

31:04.323 --> 31:06.484
in there like him...

31:06.485 --> 31:08.037
you just went in there to hide.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.199
I wasn't trying to hide.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.491
I was trying to keep
this family together.

31:13.492 --> 31:14.993
I was trying to keep
a roof over our heads

31:14.994 --> 31:17.085
- is what I was trying to do.
- You were trying to disappear!

31:17.086 --> 31:20.089
Like... like this was
somehow my fault.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.881
Luke.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.173
Luke!

31:25.174 --> 31:27.265
All I ever heard about
was how destroyed

31:27.266 --> 31:29.177
you and Mom were about Holden.

31:29.178 --> 31:30.639
It's always about Holden!

31:31.931 --> 31:33.142
But you had me.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.276
- I was still here.
- And I'm here now and Holden's here!

31:38.277 --> 31:39.978
Luke, we can try it again!

31:39.979 --> 31:42.191
Hey! Luke!

32:02.751 --> 32:03.882
It's open.

32:05.594 --> 32:07.256
Hey.

32:08.717 --> 32:12.050
Um, got most everything
on your wish list.

32:12.051 --> 32:13.682
Do you reimburse?

32:44.083 --> 32:45.714
I feel like a tool.

32:47.176 --> 32:48.717
You worried about style points?

32:52.051 --> 32:54.223
Why are you so intent
on helping me?

32:56.435 --> 33:00.309
Because I care
about what happens to you.

33:06.105 --> 33:07.946
Oh, I...

33:09.988 --> 33:12.281
Brought good luck
the first time, right?

33:24.383 --> 33:26.004
Thanks.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.109
Think back.

33:51.110 --> 33:54.073
What can you recall
from your last visit?

33:55.494 --> 33:58.577
The woods.
And a light.

34:00.119 --> 34:01.370
Focus on that light.

34:05.624 --> 34:09.088
In one, two...

34:27.235 --> 34:29.237
Come on, Holden.

34:29.237 --> 34:30.859
I'm in there.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.692
Just have to find me.

34:34.693 --> 34:36.284
Just have to remember.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.047
My God.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.318
Holden!

35:50.319 --> 35:51.530
Holden!

35:52.901 --> 35:54.151
Wake up, Holden!
Come back!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.404
Come back!

35:57.196 --> 35:58.237
I'm sorry.

36:02.741 --> 36:04.662
Holden, wake up!

36:04.663 --> 36:06.374
Wake up!

36:06.375 --> 36:08.786
Holden, wake up!

36:08.787 --> 36:11.289
It's okay, it's okay!

36:11.290 --> 36:13.170
It's okay. You're okay.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.002
There's this castle
or something.

36:15.003 --> 36:16.964
It's okay. You're okay.

36:16.965 --> 36:18.796
I never want to feel
like that again.

36:18.797 --> 36:20.678
I never want to feel
like that again.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.180
Okay. Okay.

36:26.975 --> 36:28.227
Thanks.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.189
Could eat for days.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.942
It's a side effect.

36:36.074 --> 36:38.025
I was attacked in there, Willa.

36:38.026 --> 36:40.077
It's because you didn't belong.

36:40.078 --> 36:42.029
I mean, I was
in there for years.

36:42.030 --> 36:44.283
You spent years on the run.

36:46.164 --> 36:49.917
It's a beautiful world.

36:49.918 --> 36:52.039
Filled with more
wonder and magic

36:52.040 --> 36:53.711
than you'll see
in your lifetime.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.834
But it's also
extremely dangerous.

36:56.835 --> 36:58.797
You were in there with me...

37:00.008 --> 37:02.050
and we were on the run together?

37:03.262 --> 37:05.304
Did you go in voluntarily?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.607
Why?

37:11.350 --> 37:14.021
You spent 12 years
in that place.

37:14.022 --> 37:15.614
Nearly half your life.

37:17.526 --> 37:20.158
But that place is my life.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.031
What about your family?

37:25.324 --> 37:28.536
My mom died during childbirth.

37:28.537 --> 37:32.500
And after I was born,
my dad just took off.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.543
I never knew either of them.

37:35.964 --> 37:38.336
My grandfather looked after me.

37:38.337 --> 37:39.588
Raised me.

37:40.799 --> 37:44.592
Read me bedtime stories
by Hawking,

37:44.593 --> 37:46.515
Darwin, Sagan.

37:47.976 --> 37:50.227
After all I missed,

37:50.228 --> 37:52.940
I will always be grateful

37:52.941 --> 37:55.152
for the life he gave me.

37:55.153 --> 37:58.696
Made me feel like
I was a part of something.

37:58.697 --> 38:02.490
To be working alongside him

38:02.491 --> 38:04.072
was important.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.115
Sounds like a great man.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.961
Even after everything
he's done for me, I...

38:13.962 --> 38:16.173
I still wonder sometimes

38:16.174 --> 38:18.086
what it must be like...

38:20.218 --> 38:23.050
to have a mom and a dad.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.923
To know them.

38:25.924 --> 38:27.304
Love them.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.018
It's... it's harder
than you think.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.851
But it's worth it.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.572
I can't do this on my own.

38:47.155 --> 38:48.536
You're gonna
have to eat something.

38:48.537 --> 38:51.078
I mean, a piece of pizza,

38:51.079 --> 38:55.162
burger, I... We're gonna
need a two-front attack.

38:55.163 --> 38:56.834
What do you think?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.166
Come on, seriously. You're
gonna have to help me out.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.218
This is a lot of food.

39:01.219 --> 39:02.421
Thank you.

39:06.174 --> 39:09.968
Might stay for a little bit,
if that's okay.

39:21.189 --> 39:23.401
I'll see ya, big brother.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.242
Take care of things around here

39:25.243 --> 39:26.484
like you're supposed to, huh?

39:26.485 --> 39:29.116
Guess I'll have to get
into trouble on my own.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.158
Don't study too hard.

39:31.159 --> 39:34.042
Yeah, you're the poor schmuck
taking the high school equivalency.

39:37.335 --> 39:38.496
Drive safely.

39:38.497 --> 39:39.998
- I will.
- Okay.

39:50.178 --> 39:52.970
It was so good having
you two under one roof.

39:52.971 --> 39:54.563
Just felt whole.

39:56.184 --> 39:57.605
Dad mentioned the other night

39:57.606 --> 39:59.648
the Pastor?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.780
Of course he did.

40:02.781 --> 40:04.281
You know how he feels
about church.

40:04.282 --> 40:06.734
At the house late
the other night, Mom.

40:06.735 --> 40:09.076
Seems pretty...

40:09.077 --> 40:10.327
dedicated.

40:10.328 --> 40:12.289
I was up waiting for you

40:12.290 --> 40:14.532
and I was upset
about how we parted ways.

40:14.533 --> 40:17.294
Pastor Ian's been counseling
us since the accident

40:17.295 --> 40:20.417
and last night,
he offered to keep me company.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.501
He was worried
about you, Holden.

40:24.252 --> 40:25.844
Good.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.966
I'm glad he was there
for you, Mom.

40:28.967 --> 40:30.218
Thank you.

40:38.607 --> 40:43.151
Students, you may begin
your exam now.

42:07.856 --> 42:08.986
We need to talk.

42:08.987 --> 42:10.237
What do you mean?
About what?

42:10.238 --> 42:11.569
Where's my brother?

42:11.570 --> 42:13.781
- I don't know.
- Whoa.

42:13.782 --> 42:16.153
No, no, no, please!

42:16.154 --> 42:17.415
I don't...
