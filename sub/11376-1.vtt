00:44.161 --> 00:46.529
I don't know where to begin.

00:50.931 --> 00:51.669
Lets see...

00:55.499 --> 00:57.367
This is really embarrassing.

01:03.469 --> 01:05.703
I don't know, I guess
I am pretty boring.

01:14.071 --> 01:18.826
Please, class. Show our new
student a little courtesy.

01:20.009 --> 01:21.704
Just tell us a little
about yourself, Janey.

01:24.478 --> 01:26.344
I hiccup when I get nervous.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.112
So we've learned.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.166
Janey, why don't you tell
us where are you from?

01:30.646 --> 01:34.466
From everywhere.
I mean my dad's in the army.

01:34.496 --> 01:36.309
Or at least he
wasn't really retired.

01:36.626 --> 01:38.164
So we were always moving.

01:39.217 --> 01:41.305
This has the eleventh school
that I've been to.

01:44.587 --> 01:47.230
Eleven different schools,
but uniforms are always the same.

01:47.755 --> 01:49.010
Even on Guam.

01:50.422 --> 01:52.540
Chicago is really going
to after do with fair

01:52.552 --> 01:54.779
share to impresses a
season traveler like you.

01:54.809 --> 01:58.259
Tell us about your hobbies.
Outside interests.

01:59.027 --> 02:00.548
Lets see what I like to do?...

02:04.763 --> 02:06.669
I like listening to the music.

02:08.964 --> 02:10.896
I like doing gymnastics.

02:13.732 --> 02:15.171
And I love to dance.

02:16.898 --> 02:20.327
Army bases are pretty dead,
unless you are in the army.

02:20.636 --> 02:22.771
So I always had a lot of
time to day dream...

02:23.303 --> 02:25.506
And my day dream was always the same:

02:26.039 --> 02:29.674
That some day I was gonna
get to Chicago.

02:30.541 --> 02:33.176
Because that's where
they make Dance TV.

She's gotta 25 inch TV.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.201

07:10.898 --> 07:12.033
I'll be right back.
- OK.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.334

07:16.335 --> 07:18.573
You know, he's birthday is
same as mine as almost.

07:18.603 --> 07:20.707
Do you remember when they
kissed on the music show?

07:20.737 --> 07:22.604
Yes.
- It was french kiss.

07:25.872 --> 07:28.542
Afterward he wiped his mouth.
It was quite clear about it.

07:33.111 --> 07:35.115
<i>That are DTV dancers.</i>

07:35.145 --> 07:37.184
<i>How would you like to
become one of them?</i>

07:37.214 --> 07:38.314
<i>Now is your chance,</i>

07:38.315 --> 07:43.255
<i>because we have a contest
to find a new DTV regular couple.</i>

07:43.285 --> 07:45.284
<i>If you wanna join us,

07:45.417 --> 07:47.586
<i>All you have to do is

I can't believe you missed it.

08:10.498 --> 08:11.102

08:11.132 --> 08:12.569
The big DTV news. That's what.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.066

08:14.433 --> 08:17.069
I wish my personal sources
told be about week ago.

08:18.469 --> 08:19.671
What kind of contest?

08:19.904 --> 08:21.704
For new regular couple
dancers on the Show.

08:21.971 --> 08:23.571
This could be our big break.

08:24.239 --> 08:25.941
Hey, Drew. I told you I won't dance.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.711
Very funny. I am telling you man,

08:27.741 --> 08:31.043

08:32.210 --> 08:34.378
Oh, yeah. I am a definite TV star.

08:34.578 --> 08:35.980
Me and Captain Kangaroo.

08:36.746 --> 08:40.181
Malene, I can't help of your
exceptional thinking. Its a curse.

08:40.182 --> 08:43.783
But I just can't feature, you starting
trade school right after graduation.

08:45.217 --> 08:48.949
"Jeff Malene... machinist."
I don't see it.

08:49.588 --> 08:53.692
"Jeff Malene... regular on DTV."
Oh it's there in neon.

08:53.722 --> 08:56.058
I don't need any dance contest
to tell me I'm a good dancer.

08:59.858 --> 09:00.643
Hey, snork.

09:00.673 --> 09:03.023
- Don't call me snork.
I'm not a little kid.

09:05.430 --> 09:07.097
I can't believe that
you are older then me.

09:07.098 --> 09:08.364
I am older then you.

09:27.008 --> 09:28.879
<i>Let's take a little break from
dancing right now,</i>

09:28.909 --> 09:31.743
<i>for latest music news from Mikey Rocky.</i>

09:31.943 --> 09:33.912
<i>And where is that Ricky?</i>

09:37.448 --> 09:39.448
<i>Lets all hear for steroids.</i>

09:40.115 --> 09:41.616
<i>And now, the news.</i>

09:42.149 --> 09:44.654
Did you see Rick last
time in a dog sled?

09:44.684 --> 09:46.785
Oh, God, she looked coolest.

09:54.323 --> 09:59.058
<i>In other news, Paul McCartney bought up

09:59.559 --> 10:00.426

10:01.426 --> 10:03.095
<i>But does it make him happy?</i>

10:03.195 --> 10:04.095
No habla ingles.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.699
<i>We've almost had a time.</i>

10:05.729 --> 10:06.796
<i>We'll return tomorrow,</i>

<i>Well this is Ricky saying...</i>

10:14.801 --> 10:16.402
<i>No matter how hard you try,</i>

10:16.857 --> 10:19.436
<i>You'll never be as good as me.</i>

10:20.970 --> 10:25.710
<i>And remember! Win the contest and

10:25.740 --> 10:27.375
<i>But until then,

<i>we say great one.</i>

10:33.878 --> 10:37.046
<i>We'll see you tomorrow and
DTV come dancing back.</i>

10:40.881 --> 10:42.149
That is the coolest.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.152
We are gonna be on DTV.

10:45.652 --> 10:47.456
Listen, I'm pretty good dancer

10:47.486 --> 10:49.854
But, when I like an substance
I make up in style.

10:49.855 --> 10:50.554
And you...

10:50.654 --> 10:54.456
This was you today:
"I love to dance."

10:55.908 --> 10:56.990
It was perfect.

10:58.791 --> 11:02.161
Look, I think you're forgetting I have
General Patton as a father.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.729
But you belong on DTV,
and of course so do I.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.197
Let's go audition, OK.

11:07.198 --> 11:09.001
We'll just go onto audition.

11:09.031 --> 11:11.017
Your dad can't find
anything wrong with that.

11:11.999 --> 11:12.633
Lemsky!

11:16.136 --> 11:18.436
Whats going on here?

11:24.774 --> 11:28.178
<i>I'm sorry, baby. I'm middle of the board.
What is all about?</i>

11:28.208 --> 11:32.082
I've already told you. Why don't
you listen me for a change?

11:32.207 --> 11:35.049
<i>Yes, baby, I do listen.. I remember.</i>

11:35.079 --> 11:36.813
<i>You want to be in some
kind of dance show, right?</i>

11:37.280 --> 11:40.583
Yes, daddy, I'm going
to star on dance TV.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.116
Don't you think I deserve at least that?

11:44.585 --> 11:46.997
<i>But, Princess, I thought
we were working on</i>

11:47.009 --> 11:49.488
<i>that 17th magazine
modeling contest for you.</i>

11:49.720 --> 11:52.857
The shrink is right.
I am unloved, unappreciated.

11:52.957 --> 11:54.527
I only have one car.

11:54.557 --> 11:57.258
<i>That crack will say anything that
keeps rolling money out.</i>

11:57.358 --> 11:59.462
<i>Am I giving you a big coming out party?</i>

11:59.492 --> 12:01.627
Do not try to buy my affections.

12:02.695 --> 12:04.399
I am going to be on that show, daddy.

12:04.429 --> 12:06.563
And I don't wanna hear any word about it.

12:07.664 --> 12:08.798
Now you've made me late.

12:18.141 --> 12:20.471
Decisions are the worst.

12:24.525 --> 12:28.342
One phone call.
One phone call? One phone call.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.010
Thanks for the ride.

12:32.536 --> 12:38.043
This is inexcusable.
- Don't forget to ask your dad.

12:40.297 --> 12:41.683
Hi!

12:43.175 --> 12:47.555
Nice doggie...
Benji? Boomer? Sandy?

12:47.805 --> 12:50.155
Oh, God.

12:51.310 --> 12:53.356
I don't like them that much.

13:00.698 --> 13:04.202
Hello.

13:04.327 --> 13:05.896
How was at school?

13:07.063 --> 13:08.031
It was typically.

13:08.899 --> 13:12.173
But I made a new friend.
- You did? That was fast.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.935
Listen, dad, could I talk
to you about something?

13:16.402 --> 13:17.369
Yes, sweetheart?

13:18.904 --> 13:21.349
We have to meet the
enemy, and she has BO.

13:21.379 --> 13:22.416
Zach!

13:22.556 --> 13:26.340
Zach, come here let's wash
backyard off your face.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.280
Listen, I was wondering about something.
- Whats up?

13:37.013 --> 13:39.649
You see, there's a contest
that I really wanna to enter.

13:39.882 --> 13:42.817
Health competition. That's good
for the soul. That is a spirit.

13:43.318 --> 13:46.186
We'll see what I'll do as I go on town
on Friday, and get at the dance.

13:46.286 --> 13:48.087
And if they liked me,
then I'll rehearse every night.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.388
And then if I win, I'm gonna
be on the TV, alright?

13:50.688 --> 13:51.055
Negative!

13:51.589 --> 13:52.859
A: I don't want you to
go alone in this town,

13:52.889 --> 13:54.523
before I have done
any reconnaissance.

13:54.957 --> 13:56.091
Chicago is a tough city.

13:56.592 --> 13:58.725
I've got stolen an alarm
system in this house.

13:59.928 --> 14:01.695
And B: you are too young
to go out at night.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.962
Except for the occasional
supervised school activity.

14:03.963 --> 14:07.131
When you are 18 then you
are entitled to the nightlife.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.832
Now, we had a deal remember?

14:09.199 --> 14:12.600
We made a deal when I was 7 1/2.
Nightlife was the Muppet Show.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.600
Don't sass me.

14:13.794 --> 14:15.568
I'm sorry, sir.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.521
I am doing this for your own good.

14:18.551 --> 14:21.939
Yeah. You forgot to say:
"You'll thank me for this one day".

14:25.775 --> 14:28.080
So I said: "Sister, please,
anybody could've been confused..."

14:28.110 --> 14:30.276
Hell Mary, Proud Mary and besides,

14:30.376 --> 14:32.278
I do very good Tina Turner.

14:33.445 --> 14:35.781
What did you do?
- Maybe wash older blackboard.

14:35.948 --> 14:39.683
But that's OK, because I broke every piece
of chalk in tiny little pieces.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.283
You know you can't ware
that to the audition?

14:42.951 --> 14:45.210
I know.
- Are you backing out?

14:45.211 --> 14:47.023
Lynne, look. The father
won't let me go,

14:47.053 --> 14:49.025
and my mother says that we have
to let it go if we won't battles,

14:49.055 --> 14:51.093
so we can win the war,
whatever that means.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.226
That means you are
not going anywhere.

14:52.256 --> 14:54.457
Lynne, I can't!
They won't let me go!

14:54.848 --> 14:56.959
Do you do everything
you've been told?

14:59.693 --> 15:01.293
Oh, God. You do.

15:02.128 --> 15:03.194
Look, there's your bus.

15:03.485 --> 15:08.492
Good luck, alright? Will you
call me tonight? I'm sorry.

15:08.618 --> 15:10.800

15:34.777 --> 15:39.909
Come on! You can do it!
You can do it! Take a hand!

15:41.035 --> 15:43.217
It's all matter of appearance.

15:43.819 --> 15:47.287
If you show up at audition,
on the motorcycle, you are wild kid.

15:47.553 --> 15:50.655
But if you tool up Mercedes,
you are a man to be reckoned with.

15:52.089 --> 15:54.525
When are you get rid of this thing?
- That's your problem, man.

15:54.526 --> 15:56.993
You don't understand that
this car makes statement.

15:57.308 --> 15:59.660

meets "sound of music".

25:36.107 --> 25:38.879
You're taking a fashion risk.
I like that.

25:39.946 --> 25:41.448
Just don't do it on camera.

28:25.125 --> 28:27.829
You gotta start sooner on later.

28:27.929 --> 28:31.300
Trade school was good enough for my
father and was good enough for me.

28:33.388 --> 28:36.876

Good night, honey.

moves, give me a call.

31:26.049 --> 31:29.747
Drew, can you be quiet for two seconds?
- Yea, sure.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.750
You probably meant more than a few seconds.
I mean two seconds is like nothing...

31:32.781 --> 31:34.645
One, two... there... that's two seconds.

31:38.802 --> 31:41.386
I hate when you are in bad mood.
- I am not in bad mood!

31:41.519 --> 31:45.092
Sweetheart, when you gonna buy

32:07.568 --> 32:09.469

32:09.599 --> 32:12.505
Must of had a rough night breaking

32:12.536 --> 32:13.840
Yeah? That's what you think.

32:13.870 --> 32:16.371
He didn't even see her.
She stood him up.

32:57.680 --> 33:02.585
Day-O... Day, is a day, is a day,
is a day, is a day, is a day-o...

33:02.898 --> 33:07.435
There is a time and a place
for calypso music, young lady.

33:09.046 --> 33:12.036
Open your hymn notes to page 57.

33:13.071 --> 33:17.507
We will now sing "Amazing Grace".
- What page?

33:17.907 --> 33:23.940
Lynne Stone will join us.
And sing it like an American.

33:29.323 --> 33:31.847
So, where were you last night?
I waited for you an hour and half.

33:32.181 --> 33:35.450
I tried to tell you that I couldn't go,
but you hanged-up too fast.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.791
Are you gonna do homework now?
That's terrific!

33:50.591 --> 33:54.894
For your information I wrote up a few
steps, in case something you can't do.

33:55.562 --> 33:57.263
I can do any step you can do.

33:58.263 --> 34:01.698
Really? Because I was thinking
to start with something like this...

34:12.603 --> 34:14.172
Babyish - don't you think?

34:14.938 --> 34:15.639
Babyish?

34:16.440 --> 34:18.777
Look, I've been taking gymnastics
and dance for 10 years.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.074
What do you have in mind?

34:22.275 --> 34:25.645
Well, I thought we can start
out with something like this.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.920
Yea! I saw that in three different
videos on Levi's commercial.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.004
Come here.

34:39.210 --> 34:43.714
Go like this...
Five, six, seven, eight...

34:51.625 --> 34:54.994
That's good. Okay.
Come back to me now.

34:55.628 --> 34:58.363
I am going to spin you out and I want
you to come back to me. Alright?

34:58.812 --> 35:00.155
Out and back.

35:00.436 --> 35:04.463
Oops... Back. Come back to me.
- No, that's not right...

35:05.134 --> 35:06.305
Are you always gonna wear uniform?

35:06.335 --> 35:08.005
Look. I've got news for you.

35:08.035 --> 35:10.239
I had to sneak out a choir
practice to get here, alright?

35:10.269 --> 35:12.174
It wasn't easy and it wasn't fun.

35:12.204 --> 35:16.973
Excuse me. Do one of
you have change for $20?

35:17.574 --> 35:22.443
Gosh, I do not have anything
more than $50. Sorry.

35:23.644 --> 35:26.145
My loss. Have fun.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.047
Look, we are wasting time.
Lets get back to work.

35:33.613 --> 35:37.251
Is this Mr.Glenn? - Yes.
- This is sister Natalie.

35:38.243 --> 35:41.998
Do you know where Janey is?
- No. I thought she is at school.

35:42.123 --> 35:44.255
No, she... she is not here.

35:45.156 --> 35:47.990
Please, tell her if she can't
make regularly to choir...

35:48.657 --> 35:50.392
I gonna to have to replace her.

35:50.799 --> 35:53.936
Well, I'll talk to her this
evening, sister. Thank you.

35:54.294 --> 35:56.696
You are welcome.
Thank you.

36:04.402 --> 36:05.700
Just keep going around.

36:05.874 --> 36:07.053
Will you stop showing off?

36:07.084 --> 36:09.099
Were supposed to be partners.
Or did you forget?

36:09.576 --> 36:10.980
I wish I could forget.

36:11.011 --> 36:14.613
Oh, really? Because, if you
wanna quit, it's okay with me.

36:20.127 --> 36:21.527
What's the matter with him?

36:22.844 --> 36:24.078
I hate him.

36:24.243 --> 36:26.577
He is a guy and he is alive.
What's there to hate?

36:27.012 --> 36:28.113
He's just...

36:28.832 --> 36:30.867
You know... I mean...

36:32.248 --> 36:33.985
Good. I like those qualities in the men.

36:34.016 --> 36:37.318
I've been locked up in room for over an
hour. Let me tell you... it was hideous!

36:38.384 --> 36:40.721
Is he gonna call you tomorrow?
- Yeah. I think so.

36:56.025 --> 36:58.300
I am holding this for ransom.

36:59.127 --> 37:02.150
Aw, did you and Shirley
Temple have a bad rehearsal?

37:02.499 --> 37:05.734
Yeah, it was one of my best
5 afternoons in my life.

37:06.304 --> 37:09.070
I'm not really in the mood to shoot
the breeze, so if you don't mind?

37:09.970 --> 37:13.405
Fine. I don't hold you up.

37:15.332 --> 37:20.439
But I do wanna invite you to biggest
and best debutant ball of the year.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.576
Mine.

37:22.710 --> 37:24.278
You don't have to come.

37:25.712 --> 37:28.514
But I'll save you slow
dance, just in case.

37:44.828 --> 37:46.763
- Any redeeming qualities?
- Hmm.

37:47.725 --> 37:52.261
All he does is talk about himself
and that stupid motorcycle.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.494
Bet he's a good kisser.

37:55.368 --> 37:59.670
That is so grouse.
And I can't even imagine kissing him.

38:01.332 --> 38:03.565
Whenever I'm in the room with guy,

38:03.732 --> 38:06.363
no matter who it is, date my
dentist, anybody, I think...

38:07.197 --> 38:10.960
who were the last two people on Earth,
but I puke if they kiss me.

38:11.728 --> 38:14.726
<i>Zach - Janey. Zach - Janey.</i>

38:16.325 --> 38:17.192
Hey Zach, what's going on?

38:17.293 --> 38:19.525
<i>Sister Natalie called.
You are in big trouble.</i>

38:19.556 --> 38:22.154
<i>Leave small changes
under my door.</i>

38:23.056 --> 38:26.989
Sister Natalie?
- Natalie!

38:28.987 --> 38:31.319
Oh, no. He knows that I
skipped chorus practice.

38:33.318 --> 38:39.450
Alright Lynne, what do we do now?
- Leave to me. Come on.

38:48.081 --> 38:50.760
Ok kiddo you are home,
you're safe, you are alive.

38:50.892 --> 38:52.346
- Oh, my God. What happened?

38:52.377 --> 38:54.716
She over did it. It was
gymnastic tryouts.

38:54.747 --> 38:58.831
She hyperventilated on the uneven
parallel bars. She almost spun to death.

39:00.953 --> 39:03.953
And rip her fingers off.

39:04.954 --> 39:09.671
Okay, bye. Call me later,
if you are not too dizzy.

39:35.967 --> 39:41.468
Welcome DANCE TV'S STAR DANCERS
Autographs today

39:45.023 --> 39:46.490
I want that...

39:47.522 --> 39:49.920
Check it out.
- Oh, my God.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.319
Hi.
- Hi. How are you doing?

39:53.018 --> 39:54.519
You can be here next week.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.056
Yes, but at least she has really good dance
party, do you know what I mean?

39:57.085 --> 39:58.717
Shut up. Come on.
- Bye!

39:59.517 --> 40:01.553
She is so beautiful.
- He looked at you.

40:01.583 --> 40:02.882
When?
- Twice.

40:04.227 --> 40:05.715
Shut up. You embarrass me.

40:08.103 --> 40:09.746
Your dress left or right?

40:14.355 --> 40:18.606
Well, my closets on the left side of
my bed... so I guess I dress left.

40:18.731 --> 40:21.011
Except I have to wear
something under the...

40:21.041 --> 40:22.639
cause that's on the right side of the sink.

40:24.858 --> 40:26.005
Left.

40:29.611 --> 40:32.694
Am I interrupting anything?
- What are you doing here?

40:32.861 --> 40:34.703
This is a free mart, isn't it?

40:36.469 --> 40:37.768
It's great!

40:39.000 --> 40:40.534
Excuse me! Excuse me!

40:40.863 --> 40:45.117
Hey! There is Jeffs partner, a cool girl.
- Where?

40:45.367 --> 40:49.634
Don't lower your arms!
- Janey! Lynne!

40:49.663 --> 40:51.495
Come in, guys, come here!

40:55.960 --> 40:58.326
Hey! Janey!

40:58.493 --> 41:02.625
Look. By day is high school
student, by night is a penguin.

41:02.792 --> 41:06.191
I happen to be personally invited
by Miss Natalie Sands

41:06.191 --> 41:08.189
to a party at a Country Club, tonight.

41:08.374 --> 41:11.787
You wish! She didn't invite him!

41:12.054 --> 41:13.154
She invited Jeff.

41:13.626 --> 41:18.288
He's just tagging on. Sorry. You
always hurt the one you love.

41:18.319 --> 41:21.637
Natalie...
- Be right back.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.554
Hey! Wait!

41:28.131 --> 41:30.878
You move, you bleed.

44:46.203 --> 44:49.700
I am fine. This is a beautiful party.
Must cost a bundle...

44:50.433 --> 44:53.401
Well, I'll probably recover.
- Oh, I know you will.

44:53.431 --> 44:55.330
Natalie's worth every penny of it.

44:55.564 --> 44:58.063

He can't see me like this, alright?

49:33.453 --> 49:36.153
What do you mean? It's suppose to
the glamorous holly grace uniforms?

Alright. Look, go talk to him.
I'll take care sister Sledge.

49:44.362 --> 49:48.839
Sister, would you mind showing me that
routine on horse. You are doing so well.

49:48.902 --> 49:52.316
I am so bad at it.
- Well, I suppose I could.

49:52.347 --> 49:53.347
- Thank you.

50:05.970 --> 50:08.371
Hi.
- Hi.

50:10.339 --> 50:12.173
It was quite party on Saturday, ha?

50:13.901 --> 50:16.576
Yea, well, if you like
that kind of thing.

50:17.310 --> 50:21.513
I tried to call you yesterday. To see if
you wanna on rehearsal with me.

50:24.047 --> 50:26.281

go to the air show.

- 200 people standing
around like this.

50:35.487 --> 50:37.055

50:40.437 --> 50:42.858
Can you rehearse tonight?
- Can you?

50:45.492 --> 50:50.396
Sure. What? So, you'll be there?
- No, not there. At the Court.

50:50.496 --> 50:54.897
I thought that we are gonna rehearse.
- We'll rehearse.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.501
No fraternizing! Stay away from him!
He is a boy!

Princess, you gotta have to start
learning to fend for yourself.

51:26.444 --> 51:28.617
I'm keep telling you that.
It's a cool world out there.

51:29.583 --> 51:35.187
Daddy, I don't wanna win contest
for me. I wanna win for you.

51:38.188 --> 51:42.391
I couldn't stand if those
tacky kids Janey and Jeff won.

51:44.092 --> 51:45.959
After they trashed your party.

51:47.261 --> 51:50.062
And embarrassed you in
front of all your friends.

51:52.656 --> 51:59.967
And on top of everything else, they
ruined your beautiful silver hair.

52:06.871 --> 52:08.409
Are you sure you are feeling alright?

52:08.439 --> 52:11.239
Yea, I am fine, mum.
I'm just tired, that's all.

52:12.274 --> 52:13.676

54:30.951 --> 54:32.752
Will you please let me go!

54:35.120 --> 54:40.291
Hey, pal. She is with me, okay?

54:40.725 --> 54:42.259

Daddy, you are really...
Don't do that.

01:00:18.594 --> 01:00:20.498
Go ahead. Sit down.

01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:24.470
Anyway, why ain't you in your PJ's?
Its after midnight.

01:00:27.307 --> 01:00:30.011
I was dreaming that I was
gonna be late for school.

01:00:30.446 --> 01:00:34.419
So, I woke up and I got dressed
and then I looked at the clock.

01:00:35.753 --> 01:00:38.089
Yea, but you wear uniform at
school. That's not uniform.

01:00:38.957 --> 01:00:40.896
In my dream, I went at public school.

01:00:44.637 --> 01:00:47.141
Janey, your mother and I've been talking...

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:49.641
We thought that this weekend
we send you to St. Louis

01:00:49.642 --> 01:00:50.679
on the plane to see your grandmother.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:51.502
No!

01:00:51.533 --> 01:00:53.910
- I think it's just
what doctor ordered.

01:00:54.481 --> 01:00:56.475
Not this weekend!
- Why not?

01:00:56.506 --> 01:00:59.824
There is a C-130 transport
leaving on Saturday at 0800.

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:04.864
Don't you wanna see your grandmother?
- Yea. Sure I do.

01:01:06.365 --> 01:01:10.339
See, I have to study this weekend.
There's really big Latin test on Monday.

01:01:10.673 --> 01:01:12.208
And I am way, way behind.

01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:14.145
Since when you've taken Latin?

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:16.949
Since last week, which is
why I'm way behind.

01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:20.954
But, thanks anyway, dad.

01:01:22.723 --> 01:01:26.128
I have to get to bed again.
Good night.

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:43.727
What are you? Crazy?

01:01:49.061 --> 01:01:51.097
I hope you were hurt.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:57.566
I am J.P. Sands.
- Yea, I know.

01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:01.028
Well I didn't know if you would recognize
me, without blueberry pie in my hair?

01:02:02.529 --> 01:02:06.134
Are you in a big hurry?
- Yea, a kind of.

01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:11.434
When I was about your age, I
worked in bottling factory.

01:02:12.398 --> 01:02:16.908
I own the factory now.
In the matter fact, a lot of factories,

01:02:16.938 --> 01:02:19.609
and including the one
where your father works.

01:02:20.881 --> 01:02:22.717
I am very happy for you.

01:02:23.327 --> 01:02:25.164
Don't smart mouth me.

01:02:26.021 --> 01:02:30.058
You know... I bet you and I are
lot more alike then you think.

01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:33.631
I bet you don't want your father
won't loose his job, any more then

01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:36.736
I don't want my daughter
to loose that dance contest.

01:02:45.078 --> 01:02:48.084
By the way, if you'd like to come to
my Country Club again, let me know.

01:02:49.301 --> 01:02:51.371
I'd always know how
to use that catty.

01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:20.310
Hi... hi. Hey what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong. What's wrong with you?

01:03:21.524 --> 01:03:24.529
Nothing. I just thought
since you were late.

01:03:25.075 --> 01:03:27.680
Excuse me, I didn't realize we are
punching the clock.

01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:31.060
Well we are. Come on,
today is our last day.

01:03:31.091 --> 01:03:31.990
- Not now. Please.

01:03:34.055 --> 01:03:36.760
Alright. No problem.
Let's get to work. Give a tape?

01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:43.404
No, I forgot it.
- Come on, Jeff. That's not funny.

01:03:43.434 --> 01:03:44.738
Look, I am telling you I forgot the tape.

01:03:44.768 --> 01:03:47.541
But think about things besides
the stupid contest, you know.

01:03:49.009 --> 01:03:50.712
Alright. So we don't need music anyway.

01:03:50.781 --> 01:03:53.681
Let's go through the routine.
You wanna warm up first?

01:03:54.814 --> 01:03:56.867
Would you quit treating
me like you're star dancer?

01:03:56.898 --> 01:03:59.460
And I am some poor little
clad got stuck with?

01:03:59.491 --> 01:04:03.129
Not everyone needs to warm up.
- Yes, they do.

01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:07.003
Excuse me I forgot also that
you're authority I am warming up.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:11.351
Look, I don't know whats bugging you,
but I think we should talk about it.

01:04:11.382 --> 01:04:12.348
I said no.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.646
I am not dancing with you,
until you calm down.

01:04:16.377 --> 01:04:19.809
What do you threaten me now?
I mean, that's what you do it, right?

01:04:20.264 --> 01:04:22.863
Well, forget it! I'm sick of this
whole thing anyway!

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.279
God, you are so naive, Janey!

01:04:25.807 --> 01:04:28.273
You think we gonna win this thing?
We're not gonna win.

01:04:28.373 --> 01:04:31.143
Only to be in that stupid
contest to make look fair.

01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:33.771
But it's rigged. Everything is rigged.

01:04:34.022 --> 01:04:38.154
So, what? You're just gonna quit?
I mean, just like that?

01:04:38.669 --> 01:04:40.203
Yeah, looks that way, doesn't it?

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.678
Get out of here.
You make me sick.

01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:50.541
Thanks. I'll try to return
compliments some day.

01:05:13.698 --> 01:05:16.425
Young lady, you are in big trouble!
- Robert! Robert!

01:05:16.517 --> 01:05:20.056
Now, Janey, we have to know
why you lied about Latin class

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:22.952
and then you skipped your
choir practice, and now,

01:05:22.983 --> 01:05:25.417
you sneak out of the house
without our permission?

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:29.733
Why?
- I do not know.

01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:32.457
Oh, I feel much better now
that you have explained.

01:05:32.676 --> 01:05:35.775
You can't go traipsing all over in strange
city in the middle of the night.

01:05:36.173 --> 01:05:37.754
I am sorry if you
don't understand that.

01:05:37.876 --> 01:05:41.475
Why does everybody think that
I'm not understand anything?

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.038
You are grounded!

01:05:43.202 --> 01:05:46.082
- Yeah, I don't have any
place to go anyway.

01:06:07.233 --> 01:06:09.565
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:06:13.067 --> 01:06:16.266
Dance contest is tonight, isn't it?
Don't be nervous.

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:20.888
I'm not nervous.
I'm not entering.

01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:22.696
Oh, why not?

01:06:23.158 --> 01:06:25.390
Mags said that you and
your partner were...

01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:28.870
"in dimension beyond reality."
I guess that means you're good.

01:06:29.354 --> 01:06:31.221
Look I am not in the contest, alright?

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:35.994
It's for people who are to being No.1
- Oh, and you're not in to be number one?

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:40.916
No.
- Jeff...

01:06:42.483 --> 01:06:46.404
I heard that you came up in the
World, making in Country Club see?

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:50.612
How did you hear about that?
- Bad news travels fast...

01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:53.120
Specially ones that
happens to J.P. Sands.

01:06:53.857 --> 01:06:58.355
I hate him!
- Don't say that.

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:04.163
He is a greedy, stupid, putz, granted,
but... don't hate him.

01:07:04.591 --> 01:07:06.523
I ran into him last night.

01:07:09.105 --> 01:07:11.378
So, what did he say?

01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:14.174
- He said he could put
your job on the line.

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:16.836
Is that true?

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:23.285
So what?
- So, I can't dance in the contest, can I?

01:07:23.479 --> 01:07:29.647
Look, Jeff. Tell me one thing: can you win?
- Yeah. I can win.

01:07:29.998 --> 01:07:34.862
Well, then win it!
I'll worry about Sands.

01:07:36.857 --> 01:07:40.990
Okay?
- Thanks, pop.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:04.468

01:08:04.765 --> 01:08:08.669
Okay. But we didn't even get to
ask you me about the Maggie.

01:08:09.987 --> 01:08:11.003
Maggie Malene?

01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:13.841
- She told me to tell you
Jeff is gonna dance.

01:08:20.185 --> 01:08:24.768
Oh, God. I forgot I am grounded.
Zach, what am I gonna do?

01:08:25.828 --> 01:08:30.991
You know what daddy always says: "When all
hope is lost, call for reinforcement."

01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:38.390
Zach, you are the best.
- Forget it. On the house.
