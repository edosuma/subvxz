01:00.827 --> 01:04.593
Excuse me, can you tell me
where l can find the supervisor?

01:04.664 --> 01:05.653
Over there.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.290
Thank you.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.638
Your authorization
and licenses, please?

01:21.014 --> 01:24.950
Level 6 in Thermodynamics
and Quantum Fusion.

01:25.018 --> 01:27.282
Well. Janeway.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.479
l'm impressed.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.715
Thank you, sir.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.280
Now, if you could just manage
to report to your shift on time.

01:32.358 --> 01:34.087
l'm sorry.
l boarded the wrong transport.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.286
l ended up

01:35.361 --> 01:37.090
at the Atmosphere
Filtration Facility.

01:37.163 --> 01:39.154
They're always looking
for skilled workers.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.097
l'm surprised they didn't
offer you a job.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.668
l promise,
l won't be late again.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.202
Well, it's easy
to get disoriented

01:44.270 --> 01:45.294
when you're new here.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.804
l've been in this city
all my life,

01:46.873 --> 01:48.272
and l still get lost
on occasion.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.504
Now, you'll be monitoring
the primary reactor coils.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.443
They process more
than 8,000 metric...

01:53.513 --> 01:55.811
8,000 metric tons
of tylium per second

01:55.882 --> 01:58.817
at 94 percent thermal
efficiency.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.512
l memorized the specifications.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.112
Let me know
if there's anything you need.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.181
You'll find we like
to keep our workforce happy.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.453
l can already tell

02:07.527 --> 02:09.995
it's going to be much better
than my last job.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.550
The specifications
you asked for.

04:20.627 --> 04:21.992
Thanks.

04:40.179 --> 04:43.945
lnput Error 415.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.315
Command Code Violation 2308.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.956
Come on,
shut off that damn alarm,

04:51.024 --> 04:55.051
and l promise
l'll never violate you again.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.957
You almost started
a core overload.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.056
l would have corrected it.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.226
Well, l'm sorry
for interrupting then.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.529
And for eavesdropping.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.002
l overheard you talking
to your console.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.198
lt's an old habit.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.433
Does it work?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.805
l'm not sure this control panel
and l

05:10.877 --> 05:12.538
speak the same language yet.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.773
Well, if you need
an interpreter...

05:14.847 --> 05:16.280
Jaffen.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.442
Kathryn.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.780
l work just down there.

05:19.852 --> 05:20.876
That's good to know.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.751
This station doesn't
require two operators.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.882
l don't think we've met.
l'm...

05:25.992 --> 05:28.085
Employee 1326.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.652
And you're Employee 8584.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.755
Since you're new here,
you may not be fully familiar

05:32.832 --> 05:34.766
with the labor protocols,
but you should be aware

05:34.834 --> 05:36.893
that fraternizing is not
permitted during work hours.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.231
And do you have a number
or maybe a name?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.465
Annika Hansen.

05:40.573 --> 05:43.167
And what exactly is
your position here?

05:43.242 --> 05:44.800
l'm the new Efficiency Monitor.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.812
Oh, l, uh, didn't
know they'd hired one.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.246
Now that you do, l suggest
you return to your station.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.647
We weren't fraternizing.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.948
He was just helping me
correct an input error.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.214
We're almost finished.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.347
Do it quickly.

05:57.423 --> 05:58.447
Yes, ma'am.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.185
l thought we were fraternizing.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.032
Maybe we could get
acquainted after work.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.625
Uh, there is a little place
some of us like to go to.

06:10.737 --> 06:11.669
We could get a meal.

06:11.738 --> 06:12.762
l can't.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.841
You need to talk to someone
besides your console.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.740
l appreciate the offer,
but with this new job,

06:18.811 --> 06:21.143
l don't really have time
to socialize.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.819
They're always looking
for laborers

06:35.895 --> 06:37.795
at the Power Distribution Plant.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.263
l had a job there once.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.526
Didn't like it much.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.591
Odd.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.364
They treat their employees well.

06:45.471 --> 06:46.938
How long were you there?

06:47.039 --> 06:49.030
Oh, a while.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.407
lt would be very simple
for me to find out.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.536
A day.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.877
A day?!

06:55.948 --> 06:57.540
Half a day, actually.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.244
Give or take an hour.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.684
Not what l'd call
an illustrious career.

07:01.754 --> 07:05.554
l don't belong behind a console
pushing buttons.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.458
But when l heard
some of the workers

07:08.528 --> 07:13.124
talking about your place,
l knew l had to get a job here.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.827
You were terminated,
weren't you?

07:15.968 --> 07:17.458
Yes.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.595
Oh... that's quite
an accomplishment

07:19.705 --> 07:21.104
during a labor shortage.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.106
What happened?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.666
Oh... it's a long story.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.008
l like a long story.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.140
l had a disagreement with
the new Efficiency Monitor.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.276
She didn't think
my work was very...

07:33.352 --> 07:34.284
Efficient?

07:34.353 --> 07:35.285
Exactly.

07:35.354 --> 07:37.288
Then why should l hire you?

07:37.356 --> 07:42.293
Well... there's my natural charm
and personality.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.625
They'd be a real asset
around a place like this,

07:44.697 --> 07:46.562
where you're trying
to attract patrons.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.031
l mean, look at you.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.227
You haven't been able
to tear yourself away from me.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.736
There's no one else here.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.441
Please.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.413
l really need the work.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.382
You'd better clean
those tables over there.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.353
This place is going to be
filled with hungry workers

08:09.422 --> 08:11.151
as soon as the next shift ends.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.089
You won't regret this.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.128
Oh, l'm certain l will.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.305
...all of them about my father,

08:29.375 --> 08:31.570
and he couldn't understand
why l wasn't insulted.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.010
Finally, l just had to tell him:
l'm Norvalian.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.707
l don't have a father.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.212
lt wasn't that funny, Tuvok.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.750
On the contrary.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.920
The man was ignorant
of how your species procreates.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.758
His attempt to disparage you
ultimately humiliated him.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.635
lrony is often
a source of humor.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.501
Yes, well, when you explain it
like that, uh...

09:00.573 --> 09:01.904
it's not funny at all.

09:01.974 --> 09:05.102
l also have some
humorous anecdotes to share.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.805
l'll look forward
to hearing them.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.313
l thought you didn't
have time to socialize.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.509
l'm not socializing.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.610
l'm reviewing these manuals
and having something to eat.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.484
Well, l recommend
the Latara broth,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.046
and the section
on thermal coefficients.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.648
l'll join you.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.692
Really, l'm very, very busy.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.784
Well, not to socialize.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.762
To, uh, help you
review the manuals.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.565
How was your first day?

09:29.669 --> 09:30.693
Here you are.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.737
Compliments of the proprietress.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.171
Tom.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.902
Uh, l'll be right back.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.802
The proprietress
doesn't give away drinks.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.348
Well, l'm just
creating customer loyalty.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.045
You've been creating loyalty
all night with those two women.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.610
l suggest you attend
to the other tables.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.656
Yes, ma'am.

09:53.459 --> 09:54.483
Here you are.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.528
Thank you.
Looks great.

10:12.044 --> 10:14.512
l can't believe
l let you keep me out this late.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.138
Well, l thought it
was my responsibility

10:16.215 --> 10:17.807
to help you study those manuals.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.214
Of course.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.377
And now that l have,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.421
you should be less likely
to overload the core.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.751
You know, with all this
fascinating discussion

10:28.828 --> 10:29.954
about thermal coefficients,

10:30.096 --> 10:31.723
you never told me
where you're from.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.628
A planet called Earth.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.223
Never heard of it.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.063
Oh, a long way from here.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.397
What's it like?

10:38.504 --> 10:41.962
Overpopulated, polluted,
very little work.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.973
lt sounds like my homeworld.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.375
Guess we're both
lucky to be here.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.673
lt's nice to be in a place

10:47.747 --> 10:49.772
where different species
get along so well.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.680
Oh, so, you admit
we're getting along.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.652
l was speaking
in a broader cultural context.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.119
l see.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.679
There's a lot of violence
where l come from.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.226
That's too bad.

11:01.293 --> 11:02.351
lt's getting late.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.293
l still haven't adjusted
to the weather here.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.421
lt gets so cold at night.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.988
lt's almost curfew.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.762
Yes, sir.
We both live right here.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.371
Good night, then.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.106
You know, one of the advantages
of living in employee housing

11:19.178 --> 11:21.169
is that we can
continue sharing ideas

11:21.247 --> 11:22.942
even after the workday is over.

11:23.015 --> 11:23.947
ls that so.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.540
Yes, and l do have
a spectacular view

11:25.618 --> 11:27.176
of the river
from my living quarters.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.483
l really have to get to sleep.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.749
Maybe another time.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.519
l'm sorry if l'm making
you uncomfortable.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.958
You're not.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.962
Well, if you get lonely...

11:38.064 --> 11:39.656
l'll let you know.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.244
lt wasn't me.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.744
lt's not an overload.
lt's time for our inoculations.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.879
What inoculations?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.584
They're nothing to worry about.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.785
Protection against
ambient radiation.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.987
l didn't realize
that was a problem.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.496
lt's not, as long as you're
inoculated regularly.

12:13.999 --> 12:18.026
We're lucky to have an employer
that concerned about our safety.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.229
lt wasn't that bad.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.396
lt doesn't bother me.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.030
How long did it take to go away?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.069
Ten days, two weeks.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.110
ls something wrong?

12:34.186 --> 12:36.381
Forgive me, but...

12:36.455 --> 12:38.616
l'm, l'm afraid of injections.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.784
l assure you, this is painless.

12:40.860 --> 12:45.422
ls-ls there some other method
of administering the medication?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.898
No, l'm afraid there isn't.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.264
Very well.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.431
No!

12:55.541 --> 12:57.975
No! No!

12:58.477 --> 13:00.104
We're finished.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.840
You can go back to work.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.075
Next.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.235
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 54584.3.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.774
Ensign Kim, Mr. Neelix
and l are returning to Voyager

13:29.842 --> 13:33.141
after five days of trading
with the Nar Shaddan.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.511
ln six years, l've never been
on an away mission

13:36.582 --> 13:37.947
worse than this one.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.348
l don't know
how you can say that.

13:40.419 --> 13:43.149
The cargo hold is crammed
with valuable supplies.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.951
And my stomach is crammed

13:45.057 --> 13:47.685
with alien parasites
doing back flips.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.423
l guess you shouldn't have drunk
that Falah nectar.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.055
You insisted l try it.

13:53.132 --> 13:56.863
Uh! The Nar Shaddan
consider it a delicacy.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.937
To refuse would've
insulted them.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.838
l didn't hear you insisting
that Commander Chakotay try it.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.342
Commander Chakotay's
a vegetarian.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.073
lt was made from meat?

14:08.147 --> 14:09.876
More like a meat byproduct.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.650
l'm going to be sick.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.447
Not after you drink this.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.578
What is it?

14:15.654 --> 14:17.588
Leola bark tea.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.489
To settle even the
queasiest of stomachs.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.528
Ugh! lt smells worse
than the meat nectar.

14:23.596 --> 14:27.157
l'll wait for the Doctor
to treat me.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.133
At least l'll be sleeping
in my own bed tonight.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.726
Harry, l know you're not
feeling well, but l need you

14:31.837 --> 14:33.737
and Neelix up here.

14:33.806 --> 14:34.898
On our way.

14:38.277 --> 14:40.507
Anything wrong, Commander?

14:40.579 --> 14:41.511
We're at the rendezvous
coordinates,

14:41.580 --> 14:43.480
but there's no sign of Voyager,

14:43.549 --> 14:45.779
and they're not responding
to hails.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.944
Start scanning
on all frequencies.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.420
They've got to be
out there somewhere.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.684
So much for my own bed.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.466
Reinitialize
the subspace transponder.

15:02.534 --> 15:05.503
Warning.
Main computer is failing.

15:06.605 --> 15:09.369
Switch to backup processors.

15:09.441 --> 15:12.569
Main computer stabilized.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.205
Good. Now...
let's try this again.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.341
Reinitialize
the subspace transponder.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.748
Unable to comply.

15:19.818 --> 15:20.876
Why not?

15:21.020 --> 15:22.214
lnsufficient power.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.051
And they say l'm difficult.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.751
Reroute power
from the replicator system.

15:26.825 --> 15:27.883
Unable to comply.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.085
Clarify!

15:29.161 --> 15:31.561
Relays to the transponder
are fused.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.688
Any suggestions?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.357
Please restate inquiry.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.536
Can the power relays
be bypassed?

15:39.605 --> 15:41.095
Negative.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.697
Then l suppose l'll have
to replace them by hand.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.071
Warning. lntruder alert.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.203
Where?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.473
The Bridge.

15:48.547 --> 15:49.605
How many?

15:49.682 --> 15:50.876
Two humanoids.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.076
Can you identify them?

15:52.151 --> 15:53.118
Negative.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.052
Sensor resolution
is below 20 percent.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.536
Stop what you're doing
and turn around!

16:18.310 --> 16:20.676
Take it easy, Doc!
lt's us!

16:23.515 --> 16:25.540
lt's good to see
some friendly faces.

16:25.617 --> 16:28.450
For that matter, it's good
to see any faces at all.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.080
l'm sorry l haven't gotten
life support back on line yet,

16:31.156 --> 16:32.646
but since l've been
the only one aboard,

16:32.725 --> 16:33.714
it hasn't been a priority.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.555
What the hell happened?

16:35.627 --> 16:37.390
We ran into some... problems.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.521
l can see that.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.064
Can you be
a little more specific?

16:40.132 --> 16:41.759
Of course.

16:43.535 --> 16:47.562
About... 12 hours after
you left on your away mission,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.368
things started to go wrong.

16:49.441 --> 16:52.569
We hit some sort
of subspace mine.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.880
Computer, transfer the EMH
to the mobile emitter.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.077
Sick Bay to Bridge.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.710
Sick Bay to Engineering.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.254
Please respond.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.950
lt wasn't long before
l was inundated with casualties,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.823
all suffering from
tetryon radiation poisoning.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.828
Pretty soon,
the Captain arrived.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.056
Doctor, can you
treat these people?

17:13.132 --> 17:14.359
l can stabilize them,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.833
but if we can't contain
the radiation...

17:16.969 --> 17:19.460
Get everyone to the escape pods,
quickly.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.538
Not you, Doctor.

17:20.606 --> 17:21.573
l need you here.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.867
Captain?

17:22.941 --> 17:24.032
Computer,

17:24.108 --> 17:26.099
activate the Emergency
Command Hologram.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.577
Authorization:

17:27.646 --> 17:29.443
Janeway-omega-3.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.348
Command codes transferred.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.887
You've wanted this chance
for a long time.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.012
Now you've got it.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.021
Aye, Captain.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.182
Try to vent the radiation.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.453
The rest of us will get out
of the contaminated area

17:41.527 --> 17:43.324
and head for the nearest
habitable planet.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.419
You need medical care.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.862
Unless someone answers
our distress call,

17:46.932 --> 17:47.899
we'll have to make due
with medkits.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.194
We'll rendezvous
as soon as it's safe

17:49.301 --> 17:50.563
to come back on board.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.135
Take good care of Voyager.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.334
You can count on me, Captain.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.213
The crew abandoned ship,

18:04.283 --> 18:07.150
and l began to assess
the damage caused by the mine.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.780
But before l could even get
started with the repairs,

18:10.856 --> 18:12.915
l got some unexpected company.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.549
Computer, report.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.253
An alien vessel has locked
onto Voyager

18:16.328 --> 18:17.989
with a tractor beam.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.325
Open a channel.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.730
This is the Federation
Starship Voyager.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.427
Disengage your tractor beam.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.868
Our scans show no life signs
aboard your vessel.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.302
ldentify yourself.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.341
l'm the Emergency
Command Hologram.

18:30.409 --> 18:31.398
''Hologram.''

18:31.510 --> 18:32.477
That's right.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.239
Now release my ship.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.610
Your crew has abandoned it.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.807
lt belongs to me now.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.509
l beg to differ.

18:38.584 --> 18:44.079
Computer, target the vessel's
tractor emitter and fire.

18:47.292 --> 18:52.389
Come about, heading 903 mark 6.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.694
Engage at warp 2.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.030
Warp engines are off-line.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.797
Evasive pattern Beta-4.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.701
Target the vessel's engines.

19:07.713 --> 19:12.047
Warning. Two vessels
approaching, bearing 336 mark 1.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.085
Reverse course, full impulse.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.587
l managed to evade
the other two ships

19:16.655 --> 19:18.316
and hid inside this nebula.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.789
l vented the radiation,

19:19.858 --> 19:22.122
repaired as many systems
as l could,

19:22.194 --> 19:25.652
but with no help, let's just say
l'm glad you found me.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.598
lt wasn't easy picking up
your homing signal.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.998
Well, l had to encrypt it.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.228
Every time l left the nebula,

19:31.336 --> 19:33.531
l detected more ships
searching for me.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.833
Any idea who they are?

19:34.973 --> 19:39.205
No. But l've analyzed
all of their weapons signatures.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.870
They match the subspace mine.

19:42.981 --> 19:46.678
lt was a deliberate attempt
to disable Voyager.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.220
Good thing you were here.

19:49.288 --> 19:52.519
What about the rest of the crew?

19:52.591 --> 19:54.616
Not a word.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.471
Make them comfortable.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.430
We're going to treat
your injuries.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.966
Who are you?

20:36.134 --> 20:37.601
My name is Dr. Kadan.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.797
You're in a Quarren
medical facility.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.373
My crew...?

20:42.474 --> 20:43.668
My understanding is that

20:43.742 --> 20:46.336
they've all been rescued
from their escape pods.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.106
Treat my people first.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.148
Everyone will be taken care of.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.653
Thank you.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.693
What is that medication?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.756
An antiradiation serum,
perfectly safe.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.841
What are you doing?

21:18.910 --> 21:21.276
She's suffering
from Dysphoria Syndrome.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.404
Don't worry, it's treatable.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.081
Release her immediately.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.850
Restrain him.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.025
Captain!

21:35.294 --> 21:38.286
No! No!

21:49.207 --> 21:50.139
Excuse me.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.869
Hi.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.535
l believe we know each other.

21:53.612 --> 21:54.544
You're Tuvok, right?

21:54.613 --> 21:56.410
We met last week
at the shift briefing.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.005
Before that.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.778
Before we were working here.

21:59.851 --> 22:00.840
Oh, l don't think so.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.943
l mean, we're obviously not
from the same place.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.785
Still... l believe l know you.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.349
From the hospital perhaps?

22:09.428 --> 22:10.827
What hospital?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.057
...l am not certain.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.099
We... We were patients.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.032
You must have me confused
with someone else.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.228
l've never been sick enough
to go to a hospital.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.306
l'm sorry, l have a lot
of work to finish.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.431
Please... try to remember.

22:23.542 --> 22:26.238
lt-lt may be important.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.608
ls there a problem here?

22:27.679 --> 22:29.840
l think it's just
a misunderstanding.

22:29.915 --> 22:30.882
Tuvok?

22:33.885 --> 22:35.352
She's right.

22:35.420 --> 22:36.512
lt's, uh... it's a...

22:36.588 --> 22:37.816
lt's a misunderstanding.

22:37.889 --> 22:38.856
You don't look well.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.915
Maybe you should go
to the infirmary.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.187
No, no, l'm fine. Fine.

22:43.261 --> 22:46.162
Uh... l'll go back
to my station.

22:46.231 --> 22:47.960
Sorry to have bothered you.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.959
What was that all about?

22:51.069 --> 22:53.094
l'm not sure.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.832
Strange man.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.738
And a terrible joke teller.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.674
So, are we having
dinner tonight?

22:59.745 --> 23:00.609
Again?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.009
What, you don't like my cooking?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.639
No, it's wonderful.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.647
lt's just...

23:04.716 --> 23:05.648
l'm a perfectionist.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.706
l'm going to keep trying

23:06.785 --> 23:08.810
until l make you
the perfect meal.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.481
And then we stop
eating together?

23:11.556 --> 23:16.220
l'll have dinner with you.
On one condition:

23:16.294 --> 23:19.661
l make it.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.528
l think l can accept
those terms.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.794
Good.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.301
Now go back to your station
before the Efficiency Monitor

23:25.370 --> 23:27.838
catches us fraternizing.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.640
Can l bring you something else?

23:38.717 --> 23:40.810
No, thank you.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.320
l haven't seen you
in here before.

23:43.388 --> 23:45.288
You probably just didn't notice.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.484
Oh, l'd have noticed.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.889
Well, apparently,
you aren't as observant

23:51.963 --> 23:53.453
as you think you are.

23:53.532 --> 23:54.521
Oh, really?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.590
l've been coming in here
the same time every day

23:56.701 --> 23:57.690
for the past two weeks.

23:57.803 --> 23:59.668
Well, that explains it.

23:59.738 --> 24:01.205
l usually work nights.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.796
Me, too.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.741
At the Power Distribution
Facility.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.278
You see? l am observant.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.745
Tom...

24:09.815 --> 24:12.375
Hmm... l need you for a moment.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.577
l'll be right there.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.388
Listen, you should come back in
when you get a night off.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.290
lt's a lot more fun
when there's a crowd.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.555
l don't really like crowds.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.290
Well, then, maybe we
could get together

24:26.364 --> 24:28.423
during the day sometime,
take a walk by the river.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.432
l don't think so.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.432
Why not?

24:30.535 --> 24:34.164
l am a very engaging
conversationalist.

24:35.707 --> 24:36.833
Oh.

24:36.942 --> 24:39.206
Yeah.

24:39.277 --> 24:41.142
Still want to get together?

24:41.213 --> 24:43.306
You're married.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.042
No.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.584
Oh.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.779
Enjoy your day.

24:58.096 --> 25:02.829
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 54597.9.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.832
After restoring primary systems,

25:04.936 --> 25:07.996
we've left the nebula
to try to find the crew.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.131
Though there's still
a lot of damage,

25:10.242 --> 25:11.573
we have been able
to reconfigure sensors

25:11.643 --> 25:14.077
to detect subspace mines.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.670
Ensign Kim's been running
continuous scans,

25:16.748 --> 25:18.579
but there's still
no sign of our people.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.244
On the bright side, the ships
that were searching for us

25:21.319 --> 25:22.752
seem to have given up.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.618
With only four people on board,

25:24.689 --> 25:26.350
repairs are going slowly.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.790
Power to the secondary
propulsion systems

25:32.864 --> 25:34.832
has been restored.

25:34.900 --> 25:35.889
Kim to the Doctor.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.432
Report to Astrometrics.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.231
On my way.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.607
Any luck?

25:42.674 --> 25:45.643
l've scanned ships and planets
in 83 systems.

25:45.744 --> 25:49.145
No humans, no Vulcans,
no Bolians...

25:49.214 --> 25:51.273
Maybe we can increase
the range of the sensors

25:51.349 --> 25:53.180
by tying them
into the main deflector.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.218
l've already done that.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.218
Oh.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.811
Well, we can boost
resolution by...

25:56.888 --> 25:58.480
l appreciate your input, Doc,

25:58.557 --> 26:01.253
but l didn't call you down here
to help me scan.

26:01.359 --> 26:04.226
l'm still feeling kind of queasy
from that nectar.

26:04.262 --> 26:05.695
l treated you days ago.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.028
Whatever you did hasn't worked.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.192
Maybe all those
command subroutines

26:10.302 --> 26:12.600
are compromising
your medical abilities.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.030
Maybe all that sarcasm

26:15.140 --> 26:17.506
is compromising
your natural charm.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.074
l've repaired
the deuterium injectors,

26:27.152 --> 26:29.382
brought secondary
propulsion back on line,

26:29.454 --> 26:32.719
and soothed Ensign Kim's
upset tummy.

26:32.791 --> 26:33.985
Good work.

26:34.059 --> 26:35.458
Why don't you get started

26:35.527 --> 26:38.121
on the ruptured plasma
conduits on Deck 10?

26:38.196 --> 26:41.529
Can't you take care of those?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.897
l beg your pardon?

26:43.034 --> 26:45.332
''Emergency Command Hologram.''

26:45.437 --> 26:47.337
Doesn't that suggest
my place is here

26:47.405 --> 26:49.771
in Voyager's command center?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.502
Look, Doc, l'm impressed
with the way

26:51.576 --> 26:53.771
you handled yourself
while we were gone.

26:53.845 --> 26:56.040
But right now,
we've got to prioritize.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.877
Kim to Chakotay.

26:57.949 --> 26:58.881
Go ahead.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.281
l've found them, Commander.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.148
They're on an M-Class planet.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.781
At maximum warp, we can be there
in less than three days.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.949
Transfer the coordinates
to the helm.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.822
l'll be in Astrometrics.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.186
Doctor...

27:11.262 --> 27:13.127
the Command Center is yours.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.176
Mmm, smells good.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.479
lt's only burnt on the outside.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.076
Your cooking console's
a little temperamental, huh?

27:36.154 --> 27:38.122
Did you try talking to it?

27:38.189 --> 27:41.215
Once l cut off the charred part,
l'm sure it'll be fine.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.522
Hmm.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.696
lt's good.

27:56.808 --> 27:57.968
Really?

28:01.112 --> 28:03.080
Let's go.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.809
Where?

28:04.916 --> 28:06.110
l promised you dinner.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.448
We'll just have to get it
somewhere else.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.545
Wait.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.715
l'm not really hungry.

28:12.791 --> 28:13.815
Are you?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.325
No.

28:15.393 --> 28:16.724
Let's stay here.

28:29.741 --> 28:34.041
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 54608.6.

28:34.112 --> 28:36.046
We've traced
the crew's life signs

28:36.114 --> 28:38.309
to a large city on a planet
called Quarra.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.442
Unfortunately,
the local officials

28:40.518 --> 28:43.112
aren't being very cooperative.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.055
l have personally interviewed
several of the individuals

28:46.124 --> 28:47.250
on your crew manifest.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.088
None of them know who you are,

28:49.160 --> 28:51.822
nor have they heard
of a Starship Voyager.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.887
l'd like to speak to them
myself.

28:54.032 --> 28:55.294
That's not possible.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.697
lf you're telling the truth,

28:56.801 --> 28:59.361
you have nothing to lose
by letting us talk to them.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.871
Unlike other planets
in this system,

29:01.973 --> 29:06.342
we grant our guest workers
the full protection of our laws.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.436
What exactly are you
protecting them from?

29:08.513 --> 29:11.539
Unscrupulous individuals
attempting to acquire

29:11.616 --> 29:12.674
skilled laborers.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.309
We're not trying
to acquire laborers.

29:14.385 --> 29:15.818
We're trying
to find our friends.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.821
Most of your friends
have excellent positions

29:17.922 --> 29:20.789
in the Central Power Facility
in the capitol.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.952
Why would any of them
want to travel thousands

29:23.027 --> 29:25.621
of light-years to a planet
on the other side of the galaxy,

29:25.697 --> 29:28.632
when they have safe,
comfortable lives right here?

29:28.700 --> 29:30.395
Because it isn't their home.

29:30.502 --> 29:34.598
l suggest you look elsewhere
to increase your labor supply.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.504
And if you attempt
to disturb any of our citizens,

29:37.575 --> 29:39.770
we will respond with force.

29:41.579 --> 29:42.773
Any luck?

29:42.847 --> 29:45.179
There's no way to beam them
through the shield grid.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.979
Take us out of orbit.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.814
We're not leaving them behind.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.013
No.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.113
But l want these people
to think we are.

30:09.207 --> 30:13.803
Hope the cooking console's
not being temperamental again.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.870
Making a hot drink
is one thing l can do.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.151
You're right.
lt's good.

30:21.219 --> 30:22.584
l told you.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.790
Mmm.

30:30.862 --> 30:34.457
What's even better
is being here with you.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.727
Are you comfortable?

30:36.835 --> 30:39.929
The blanket's nice and warm.

30:40.038 --> 30:43.030
No, l mean here with me.

30:47.545 --> 30:51.914
l can't remember
being more comfortable...

30:51.983 --> 30:54.110
in my life.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.217
Yeah, l'll take care of it.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.751
Hi.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.889
Listen, l get off work
in a few minutes.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.465
l thought maybe you
and l could go to...

31:08.533 --> 31:10.364
You don't give up, do you?

31:10.468 --> 31:12.561
You don't even know
what l was gonna say.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.137
Let me guess.

31:14.205 --> 31:17.504
You're going to invite me
to take a walk by the river

31:17.575 --> 31:20.772
or maybe to your living quarters
to admire the view.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.938
Actually...

31:23.014 --> 31:24.948
l was going to offer
to introduce you

31:25.083 --> 31:26.243
to some people l met.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.445
A couple expecting
their first baby in a few weeks.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.617
l thought you might want to
get to know some other parents.

31:34.692 --> 31:36.159
You know, swap stories,

31:36.227 --> 31:39.025
maybe even find a playmate
for your baby.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.191
lf it's a bad idea...

31:42.300 --> 31:44.268
No.

31:44.369 --> 31:46.166
No, it's nice.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.604
Listen, l'm sorry
about the other day.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.301
l'm the one
who should be apologizing.

31:51.376 --> 31:52.570
l shouldn't have assumed...

31:52.644 --> 31:53.906
-Forget it.
-Look, it's

31:53.978 --> 31:55.536
rare that l admit l'm wrong,

31:55.613 --> 31:58.946
so you might as well take
advantage of it while you can.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.883
lt's been hard...

32:03.955 --> 32:06.753
being alone with a baby coming.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.758
l have a habit
of keeping my guard up.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.760
Well, that's understandable.

32:10.828 --> 32:13.729
lt's just...
a romantic relationship

32:13.798 --> 32:15.789
is really out of the question
for me right now, and when

32:15.867 --> 32:17.334
-you started asking...
-How about a friend?

32:17.435 --> 32:18.766
What?

32:18.870 --> 32:22.601
Well, you said romance
is out of the question.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.006
Could you use a friend?

32:33.518 --> 32:34.849
Any progress?

32:34.919 --> 32:37.046
l've spoken to the
captains of eight vessels

32:37.121 --> 32:38.952
that left Quarra
in the last two weeks.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.820
No one knew anything
about the crew?

32:40.892 --> 32:41.950
No.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.152
But every one of them
asked me if l was looking

32:44.228 --> 32:45.286
for employment.

32:45.363 --> 32:47.456
Apparently, there's
a severe labor shortage

32:47.532 --> 32:48.590
throughout this system.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.657
There's a lot of competition
for workers.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.736
That ambassador said
most of our people

32:52.837 --> 32:54.862
were working
at the main power facility.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.567
l wonder if they still have
any positions to fill.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.337
l can make some inquiries.
Why?

33:02.080 --> 33:04.207
Because you and l are going
to find ourselves jobs.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.978
Reentering orbit
might arouse their suspicion.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.313
Not if we take my ship.

33:08.386 --> 33:09.444
Good idea, Neelix.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.420
Commander,
you've spoken directly

33:11.489 --> 33:13.457
with several
government officials.

33:13.524 --> 33:14.957
You could be recognized.

33:16.294 --> 33:20.196
lsn't reconstructive surgery
one of your specialties?

33:27.739 --> 33:31.641
l still say you should've
posed as a Talaxian.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.700
We'd have made a striking pair.

33:33.811 --> 33:35.438
Whiskers make me itch.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.537
How did it go?

33:36.614 --> 33:37.706
As soon as l

33:37.782 --> 33:39.579
told the supervisor
our qualifications,

33:39.650 --> 33:40.810
he was eager to hire us.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.353
He even helped me get
a docking permit for my ship.

33:43.421 --> 33:45.753
We'll be gainfully employed
by tomorrow morning.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.620
Here you go, Doc.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.159
Give me your hand, Mr. Neelix.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.159
What's this?

33:50.228 --> 33:51.490
A subdermal transponder.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.655
lt will allow us
to maintain an open com-link

33:53.731 --> 33:55.926
so we can transport you
through the shield grid

33:56.034 --> 33:57.558
if there's trouble.

33:57.668 --> 33:59.727
Hold position
at maximum transporter range.

33:59.837 --> 34:00.929
Aye, sir.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.303
l assumed l'd be in charge
during your absence, Commander.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.306
Excuse me?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.309
An Emergency Command Hologram,

34:06.377 --> 34:09.869
programmed with over two million
tactical subroutines,

34:09.947 --> 34:11.208
outranks an Ensign.

34:11.282 --> 34:12.840
A few words to the computer,

34:12.917 --> 34:15.612
and this Ensign
can delete those subroutines.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.984
Then you'd be depriving yourself

34:18.056 --> 34:20.353
of a skilled leader
for the sake of your ego.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.585
Oh, my ego!

34:21.659 --> 34:23.889
Gentlemen...

34:24.027 --> 34:25.120
work it out.

34:25.196 --> 34:28.097
Aye, sir.

34:50.755 --> 34:55.454
Employee 8583.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.494
Mr. Tuvok.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.655
According to my records,
you've neglected to report

34:59.730 --> 35:01.857
for your last three
inoculations.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.301
These inoculations are
for your protection.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.840
A sick worker is not
an efficient worker.

35:11.008 --> 35:14.603
Report to the infirmary.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.271
Seven of Nine.

35:16.347 --> 35:17.336
What?

35:17.415 --> 35:19.178
Seven of Nine.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.481
lt's... your designation.

35:22.553 --> 35:25.021
My employee number is 8586.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.420
Take your hands off me!

35:26.491 --> 35:28.015
Call Security!

35:34.499 --> 35:37.059
l don't believe you are
who you think you are!

35:38.236 --> 35:39.533
We don't belong here.

35:39.637 --> 35:40.569
We don't belong here!

35:40.638 --> 35:44.335
This isn't right!

35:44.408 --> 35:46.774
We don't belong here!

35:55.386 --> 35:58.219
Qualification Level 3
in microkinetics.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.621
You could use
some improvement there.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.353
Level 5
in thermionic conversion.

36:03.394 --> 36:04.656
Good.

36:04.729 --> 36:07.425
We lost a thermionic
specialist yesterday.

36:07.498 --> 36:08.522
Did he find a better job?

36:08.599 --> 36:10.362
Uh, health problems.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.026
Someone you know?

36:12.136 --> 36:14.969
No, just... an unusual species.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.097
We have a diverse workforce.

36:16.207 --> 36:19.643
Our thermionic converters
operate on a rotating frequency,

36:19.710 --> 36:21.871
so they have to be
closely monitored.

36:21.979 --> 36:25.642
You'll be required to report
your readings to the Controller

36:25.716 --> 36:26.978
at regular intervals.

36:27.051 --> 36:28.279
Any questions?

36:32.957 --> 36:35.323
Are you listening to me?

36:35.393 --> 36:36.883
Sorry, sir.

36:36.961 --> 36:38.929
l'm just excited to be here.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.933
Carry on.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.445
Kathryn.

36:58.516 --> 36:59.778
Yes.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.784
lt's Chakotay.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.444
l'm sorry?

37:05.189 --> 37:06.656
l'm new here.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.692
The supervisor said you
would be a good person

37:08.759 --> 37:10.226
to speak to
if l had any questions.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.728
Mm. What can l help you with?

37:12.797 --> 37:14.560
Nothing.

37:14.632 --> 37:17.032
l just wanted
to introduce myself.

37:17.134 --> 37:19.602
Oh, what did you say
your name was?

37:19.704 --> 37:21.331
Chakotay.

37:21.439 --> 37:25.307
Actually, that's just
what my friends call me.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.844
My employment file
lists my given name:

37:27.945 --> 37:30.539
Amal Kotay.

37:30.615 --> 37:31.877
Well, whatever your name is,

37:31.983 --> 37:33.883
l'm happy to help you
any way l can.

37:37.622 --> 37:38.748
No, no!

37:38.823 --> 37:40.518
You're experiencing

37:40.591 --> 37:42.183
a relapse of Dysphoria Syndrome.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.125
This is going to make you
feel better.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.062
Get away from me!

37:48.432 --> 37:50.866
Losing my job there
was the best thing

37:50.968 --> 37:52.560
that ever happened to me.

37:52.670 --> 37:53.898
Why is that?

37:54.071 --> 37:56.130
Well, so many rules
and regulations.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.208
lt was like
a military operation.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.504
l know what you mean.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.602
''Report here, reroute
power there.''

38:01.679 --> 38:04.045
lt's almost like serving
aboard a starship.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.042
Have you ever done that?

38:07.118 --> 38:09.951
You're looking
at the former captain

38:10.021 --> 38:11.955
of his own cargo vessel.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.617
Hmm, must be quite a life.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.818
What about you?

38:15.926 --> 38:17.723
Ever worked on a ship?

38:17.795 --> 38:18.921
Oh, no.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.520
Space travel makes me sick.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.060
l'm not lying.

38:25.169 --> 38:28.263
So, do you know most of the
people that come in here?

38:28.372 --> 38:30.602
A lot of them.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.007
This is a great place to work.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.305
Seems like it.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.539
l could put in a good word
for you to my employer.

38:36.614 --> 38:37.774
Ah, Neelix.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.975
l was wondering
when you'd get here.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.747
Amal Kotay, this is
my new friend, Tom Paris.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.878
What can l get you?

38:44.021 --> 38:45.511
That looks good.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.594
l was assigned
to the primary fusion chamber

38:50.661 --> 38:52.652
along with Mulcahey and Celes.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.561
Neither of them recognized me.

38:54.632 --> 38:55.656
Let me guess.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.394
They really love their jobs.

38:57.501 --> 39:00.868
lt's like they've all been
programmed to be happy here.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.030
lt's a safe bet
they're not going

39:03.140 --> 39:05.074
-to leave willingly.
-Here you go.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.610
Hi. How was your first day?

39:13.684 --> 39:14.912
Not bad.

39:14.985 --> 39:17.283
Would you and your friend
like to join us?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.516
That would be nice.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.684
Um, actually, l was hoping
we could eat alone tonight.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.290
Maybe another time.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.456
That was rude.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.001
l'm sorry.
l just, um...

39:32.069 --> 39:34.970
There's something l'd like
to talk to you about.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.308
Thanks.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.503
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you for joining us.

39:41.746 --> 39:44.112
B'Elanna.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.375
l'm due for a break.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.280
l'll walk you to the transport.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.012
Stop worrying.
l'll be fine.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.350
lt's not you
that l'm worried about.

39:51.422 --> 39:55.051
The baby will be fine, too.

40:07.538 --> 40:10.063
So, what l was thinking is...

40:11.876 --> 40:15.903
...if we were to combine
our resources,

40:15.980 --> 40:18.471
we would reduce our expenses.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.243
Are you asking me to move in?

40:24.321 --> 40:26.289
Yes.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.723
l know it's impulsive.

40:29.794 --> 40:33.821
l... know we haven't known
each other very long, but...

40:33.898 --> 40:37.800
things are so easy
when we're together.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.426
And l just thought l...

40:39.537 --> 40:41.698
Okay.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.536
What?

40:44.608 --> 40:47.338
Maybe l'm out of my mind...

40:48.479 --> 40:50.811
...but let's try it.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.778
l think this is gonna be
a lot of fun, don't you?

40:55.853 --> 40:57.411
lt's gonna be great.
You'll see.

40:57.488 --> 40:58.716
Yeah.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.915
Yeah, they're waiting for us.

40:59.990 --> 41:01.184
Come on, we got to go,
all right?

41:07.898 --> 41:09.160
Oh, excuse me.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.757
lt was my fault.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.836
l should watch where l'm going.

41:12.937 --> 41:14.666
B'Elanna?

41:14.772 --> 41:16.899
How do you know my name?

41:17.041 --> 41:19.669
What if l told you
we were old friends?

41:21.812 --> 41:23.575
That's a ridiculous statement.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.844
l know it sounds strange,
but l can prove it to you.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.283
Look, l'm sorry,
but l'm late for work.

41:29.353 --> 41:30.342
Let go of me!

41:30.421 --> 41:31.979
l'm not going to hurt you.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.422
-Security, help.
-Chakotay to Voyager.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.086
We've got B'Elanna.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.687
Lock on to Neelix's signal,
and transport them to Sick Bay.

41:40.764 --> 41:41.924
Acknowledged.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.591
Help me!

41:43.667 --> 41:45.430
Let her go!

41:49.773 --> 41:51.331
Stop!

41:51.442 --> 41:53.740
Harry, l need
an emergency transport now!

41:55.012 --> 41:57.276
Sorry, Commander,
we're under attack.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.815
l had to raise shields.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.879
No, leave me alone!

42:05.990 --> 42:07.582
We're friends.
We're trying to help you.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.057
No, don't touch me!

42:40.457 --> 42:42.550
He turned into the accessway.

42:42.626 --> 42:44.685
l'll call for reinforcements.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.067
l think he went in there!

43:00.177 --> 43:01.735
Be careful!
He might be armed!
