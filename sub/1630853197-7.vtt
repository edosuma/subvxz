WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.695
You're a warrior

00:31.490 --> 00:33.450
"You're On!"

00:41.166 --> 00:42.417
And done.

00:42.501 --> 00:46.004
Another excellent tale of heroic heroism.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.214
Hey, Pony?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.968
-You wanna trade?-No, thanks.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.429
I've read that one, like,a gazillion times.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.224
Maybe we could play a game instead.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.729
Dandy Land? No. Guess What? Dandy Land? No. Guess What?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.897
Scrababble? No, thanks.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.359
These are little-kid games, Pony.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.279
I'm ready for some serious gaming action.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
Huh?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.702
"Ultimate Ruler."

01:18.912 --> 01:24.168
"King Winsalot.Fiddle-dee-dee. All your gold for me."

01:25.169 --> 01:26.086
How about this one?

01:27.921 --> 01:31.425
I mean, I don't know about that one.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.512
Did I hear someone say "Scrababble"?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.764
Oh, my Freda.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.643
I haven't seen Ultimate Ruler in ages!

01:43.478 --> 01:45.355
I love that game!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.191
Great! Let's play it.

01:50.444 --> 01:54.406
"Once upon a time, there was a peacefulrealm where everyone shared equally.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.576
Like a bunch of suckers.

01:57.659 --> 02:01.663
As a player, you have the chanceto become the ultimate ruler. As a player, you have the chanceto become the ultimate ruler.

02:01.747 --> 02:08.002
Seize the most land, gold,and possessions, or you're the loser."

02:08.544 --> 02:11.131
Wow. That's kinda harsh.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.342
Right? Isn't it awesome?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.220
Uh, why don't we pick our pieces?

02:19.765 --> 02:21.099
Dibs on the sword!

02:21.183 --> 02:23.018
Okay.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.730
We'll be the horse.A noble steed like Pony.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.735
And I'll be the helmet. I'll roll first.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.366
Four. Not a bad rollfor a rusty old helmet.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.451
-You wanna go next, bud?-Sure.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.370
Let 'em have it, Pony.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.497
Two.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.167
Watch out, Dad. I'm right behind ya.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.670
Catch me if you can.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.298
Yes, yes. Finally, my turn.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.467
Boom!

02:56.802 --> 02:58.887
Wow, Mom. Good roll.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.764
Great roll. Great roll.

03:00.848 --> 03:05.978
I landed on the taxation square,so you each owe me 50 gold pieces.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.438
Pay up!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.360
Fiddle-dee-dee.

03:29.626 --> 03:34.840
I had no idea Mom could be like this.Have you ever seen anyone so competitive?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.967
All right, Pony!

03:37.676 --> 03:38.886
Yeah!

03:38.969 --> 03:41.305
I wonder where she gets it from.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.352
Oh, come on. My helmet.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.982
We've gotta do something about this.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.569
Snack break!Dad, may I see you in the kitchen?

03:57.237 --> 04:01.241
So, your mom gets a little competitivewhen we play this game. So, your mom gets a little competitivewhen we play this game.

04:01.325 --> 04:05.287
I noticed. What's the deal?She never acts like this.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.833
It's that cursed game.It has an effect on her.

04:09.917 --> 04:15.672
Whenever she plays it,she turns into a game monster!

04:17.007 --> 04:20.344
But it's no big deal.It'll only take an hour to play.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.930
An hour is like forever!

04:23.639 --> 04:24.640
You're telling me.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.644
It gets pretty boring by the endwhen only one person is still into it.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.439
I've tried to throw that game outlike 12 times,

04:32.523 --> 04:35.442
but it keeps finding its wayback onto the shelf.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.654
Like it's looking for her.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.284
Mine, mine, mine!

04:48.372 --> 04:50.290
Yeah, it might be a little haunted.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.085
Dad, this game is out to get her.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.878
If throwing it out didn't work,

04:55.379 --> 04:58.465
maybe we can make her loseinterest in it so she'll stop playing.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.009
Yeah. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

05:01.093 --> 05:05.013
Just follow our lead.Me and Pony are diversion pros.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.602
Come on. Where's your dad?Let's keep this train a-chugging.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.860
He just had to do a thing.

05:19.236 --> 05:24.408
Oh, no! I can't believe my eyes.There's a ghost!

05:27.661 --> 05:30.330
Don't play the game.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.085
Mom, don't you wanna see the ghost?

05:35.169 --> 05:38.881
Can't look. In the zone.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.049
Moving on to plan B.

05:45.846 --> 05:50.517
Why, what's this?More rules we didn't see before?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.478
How interesting.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.024
What? New rules? Where?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.984
Why, right here in the box.

05:59.067 --> 06:04.489
"After every turn, you must high-five.Firm handshakes are also acceptable." "After every turn, you must high-five.Firm handshakes are also acceptable."

06:04.573 --> 06:07.284
And the objective of the game has changed

06:07.367 --> 06:11.413
from becoming the ultimate rulerto the ultimate friend!

06:12.122 --> 06:16.001
Wha-- Well, those sound like ruleswe can all get behind, right?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.839
Hey. Those rules are written in crayon.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.092
There's no way they're official.Classic rules only.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.518
I look good.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.977
Fiddle-dee-dee.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.896
Hey, Mom?

06:35.979 --> 06:39.107
Me and Dad are getting another snack.You want anything?

06:39.191 --> 06:42.069
I hunger for naught but power.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.364
Cool. Be right back.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.700
It's time for plan C.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.371
Hello?

06:52.454 --> 06:54.373
What's taking you three so long?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.083
My victory awaits.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.087
-Hello!-Help! Help! -Hello!-Help! Help!

07:00.170 --> 07:01.922
Hands off my baby girl, fiend!

07:02.881 --> 07:07.135
Father, fear not. You shan't yet perish.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.764
Oh, Daughter.Great calamity hath befallen me.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.183
I am smoked.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.020
No! Not smoked.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.398
What is going on in here?Where are the fiends?

07:19.481 --> 07:22.025
It was awful.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.279
A wild thunder boarbroke into the kitchen.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.949
No! The beast returns.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.039
We must abandon the game.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.292
Dad has been attacked.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.837
And he's… sick!

07:42.504 --> 07:45.674
The only thing he's sick of is losing.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.011
Now, let's finish this.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.138
Well, we tried, Pinecake.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.141
We'll just have to buckle upand make it through the rest of the game.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.937
Or, we do have one other plan.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.607
No. It's too risky. No. It's too risky.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.525
It's the only way!

08:03.609 --> 08:06.987
Or we'll be stuckwith a game monster forever!

08:07.738 --> 08:09.615
'Bout another half hour max really.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.283
Half an hour? No!

08:11.366 --> 08:13.952
It's time for plan D.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.706
For danger or doom. Either works.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.587
Fiddle-dee-dee.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.798
All your gold for me!

08:28.091 --> 08:29.218
Fiddle-dee-dee.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.472
Fiddle-dee-dee.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.142
Where did she even get that stuff?

08:40.562 --> 08:41.897
My turn.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.567
Fiddle-dee-dee, a six.

08:45.651 --> 08:49.154
I've imposed a loitering fee!

08:49.238 --> 08:54.743
Everyone else on the boardmust pay me a fine of 20 gold pieces!

08:59.623 --> 09:02.835
Time to put plan D into action, pal. Time to put plan D into action, pal.

09:03.335 --> 09:10.133
The only way to beat a game monsteris to become a game monster.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.678
Six!

09:13.554 --> 09:16.974
Taxation square. Fork over the gold, lady!

09:18.642 --> 09:22.396
So it's gonna be like that, huh?You're on!

09:22.479 --> 09:24.231
No, you're on!

09:24.314 --> 09:25.315
Just watch me!

09:25.399 --> 09:27.192
After you watch me!

09:27.276 --> 09:29.736
This is my actual nightmare.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.697
Ah, thanks, old guy.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.198
Ha!

09:33.907 --> 09:36.118
Eat this!

09:40.289 --> 09:41.665
Yeah!

09:43.625 --> 09:45.836
Well, chow on this.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.215
Hey, this is actually pretty fun.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.428
Yeah! Another six!

09:54.511 --> 09:57.055
In yo face!

10:16.575 --> 10:22.539
No! Why?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.542
Mom, I get that this game can be fun.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.920
Like, really fun.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.423
But it's only a good gameif it's fun for everyone.

10:31.507 --> 10:35.761
And the way we're playing right now isn't.

10:35.844 --> 10:39.848
So, from one game monster to another,

10:39.932 --> 10:43.477
what do you saywe get rid of this game for good?

10:55.739 --> 10:58.867
Fiddle-dee-dee. Fiddle-dee-- No!

11:01.036 --> 11:03.539
Sorry for letting that gameget the better of me, bud.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.291
I'm so proud of you for saying something.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.252
Why didn't you say something?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.839
You were having so much funwith your terrifying game,

11:11.922 --> 11:13.674
I didn't know what to say. But…

11:13.757 --> 11:16.969
You know, I could learn a thingor two from this brave girl.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.805
So, what should we do now?

11:20.722 --> 11:23.642
Did I hear someone say "Scrababble"?

11:23.725 --> 11:24.852
Yeah!

11:24.935 --> 11:26.895
-You're on!-No, you're on!

11:33.068 --> 11:35.153
"The Pony Express."

11:37.823 --> 11:42.369
Three, two, one, begin!

12:08.687 --> 12:10.981
-Yes!-It is a tie!

12:12.858 --> 12:15.944
-But yeah, it's a total tie.-Really? I don't know.

12:22.034 --> 12:26.455
Sorry, Pony.It's just that Annabelle is so great.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.916
No, Pony, that's a bad thing.

12:28.999 --> 12:33.295
Think of all the Lil Rumblersthat went on to become heroic heroes.

12:33.378 --> 12:37.883
Bow the Bonebreaker. Hermosa the Hammer!

12:38.509 --> 12:40.469
Know what they all have in common?

12:40.969 --> 12:44.097
They were top of their classin every challenge.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.309
But no matter what I do,I can't beat Annabelle.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.647
Her moves are so precise,and she never gets tired.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.651
I bet Gladys thinksshe's way better than me.

12:57.444 --> 13:02.449
I know you think I'm the best, pal.I only wish Gladys did. I know you think I'm the best, pal.I only wish Gladys did.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.869
Gather round! I have a quest!

13:07.746 --> 13:09.414
This package must be delivered

13:09.498 --> 13:12.543
to the wizard Violetmoonof Fletchers' Vale.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.670
A task so important,

13:14.753 --> 13:18.757
I can only entrust itto a warrior of unique skill:

13:18.841 --> 13:19.842
Pinecone!

13:22.010 --> 13:24.054
I'm number one! I'm number o--

13:24.137 --> 13:26.348
And Annabelle!

13:27.599 --> 13:30.477
Both of us? Me and her? Together?

13:30.561 --> 13:33.772
Yes. That is what I meant by "and."

13:34.356 --> 13:39.611
The package must arrivebefore sundown or all shall be lost.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.029
Have a great trip.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.704
We're gonna crush this quest, Pony,

13:48.787 --> 13:50.205
for I have made…

13:51.665 --> 13:53.959
the ultimate bravery route.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.588
It hits every heroic hot spot on the way,

13:57.671 --> 14:00.924
from the Perilous Plainsto the Caves of Calamity. from the Perilous Plainsto the Caves of Calamity.

14:01.008 --> 14:04.761
Gladys is gonna be like,"What a brave route.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.973
Pinecone and Pony,you are the best Lil Rumblers ever."

14:08.599 --> 14:12.186
-This way, everyone.-Wait. What are you doing?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.520
Leading the way.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.191
I kinda thought I'd be the leader.I even planned a route.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.275
So did I.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.988
Mine charts the most efficient pathaccording to the five S's:

14:23.071 --> 14:27.993
speed of route, steed-friendly roads,and simply stunning scenery.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.788
And seeing as she already gave memy navigation token,

14:31.872 --> 14:34.416
I'm sure this is the routeGladys would have preferred.

14:35.292 --> 14:41.798
Then-- Then I'm carrying the package,seeing as Gladys said my name first!

14:42.424 --> 14:44.927
Fine by me. Let's ride.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.479
Come along, Pinecone.

15:02.653 --> 15:06.949
Well, it's about time.All day, it's been nothing but sunshine.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.410
And blue skies. Pass.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.705
But finally,a little entertainment has arrived.

15:17.835 --> 15:22.381
Oh, humans, with their little dramasand their little treasures.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.426
Gladys likes me best!

15:27.052 --> 15:28.262
No, me!

15:29.972 --> 15:32.015
This will be fun!

15:32.099 --> 15:34.268
Dragon, warrior, wizard.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.353
Look at that. I win again!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.981
Only 'cause you keep playing dragon.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.400
Because you always play warrior.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.194
Warrior is the sign of champions.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.531
Dragon, warrior, wizard.Dragon, warrior, wizard.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.993
Stop playing dragon.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.707
Pinecone thinksshe has a chance of impressing Gladys,

15:56.790 --> 16:00.836
but the truth isshe's just not good enough. but the truth isshe's just not good enough.

16:01.879 --> 16:05.174
There you are, slowpoke.What's the matter?

16:05.257 --> 16:07.259
Nothing. I'm fine.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.684
The Moody Marsh. We're making great time.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.148
Just follow mealong this log I found and--

16:23.609 --> 16:25.611
Why aren't you crossing on the log?

16:25.694 --> 16:28.447
'Cause this is faster. And more fun.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.578
Annabelle thinks she's so perfect.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.707
But under all that bossiness,even Gladys knows she's just a big fake.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.006
So, which way are we going next?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.512
What's their problem?

16:54.723 --> 16:56.975
I think we should give the horses a break.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.310
Fine with me.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.404
If anyone needsa break, it's clearly Pinecone.

17:09.488 --> 17:14.742
She's a good enough Lil Rumbler,but she will never be a great warrior.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.994
That is it!

17:18.622 --> 17:23.585
You and me, warrior-off to find outwho's the best once and for all.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.963
Fine! What'll it be?

17:28.339 --> 17:32.177
Rope climb. May the best warrior win.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.637
Thank you. I will.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.565
Three, two, one, begin!

17:47.526 --> 17:49.528
Pinecone? Pinecone?

17:49.611 --> 17:53.574
Nice try, but you will never distract me.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.409
The package is gone.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.664
Great! You had one job and you blew it! Great! You had one job and you blew it!

18:01.164 --> 18:04.668
I bet you hid itso you could tell Gladys I lost it.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.545
But I'm gonna find it.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.005
Not if I find it first!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.928
Come on. Come on. Where is it?

18:16.513 --> 18:18.724
Do you mind? We're searching here.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.976
We were searching here first!

18:21.059 --> 18:24.980
Why are you acting this way?This is hardly the behavior of a warrior.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.401
So? According to you,I'll never be a great warrior anyway!

18:29.484 --> 18:33.322
What are you talking about?According to you, I'm a big fake!

18:33.405 --> 18:36.450
What? I'd never say that about you.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.161
And I would never say that about you.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.913
Why would I say that about…

18:41.538 --> 18:43.415
someone who's better than me?

18:43.498 --> 18:45.542
You really think that?

18:45.626 --> 18:49.546
But you're so talented,and you always look so confident.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.049
Just 'cause I look it,doesn't mean I feel it.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.842
You're two years younger than me,

18:53.926 --> 18:56.512
and I have to work so hardjust to keep up with you.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.348
I always thought you were better than me.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.601
That's why I wanted to lead this quest.To prove-- That's why I wanted to lead this quest.To prove--

19:02.684 --> 19:04.770
To prove you're the best to Gladys.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.480
Yeah, me too.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.858
So, if you think I'm the best,

19:09.942 --> 19:15.906
and I think you're the best,I guess we're both the best?

19:15.989 --> 19:18.784
Well, the word "best"implies there's only one,

19:18.867 --> 19:21.870
so technically it meansthe concept is irrelevant.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.914
But what you said works too.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.751
If neither of ussaid those things, who did?

19:29.294 --> 19:30.629
Pony, what is it?

19:32.422 --> 19:37.010
I knew humans are easy to fool,but I didn't think it would be that easy!

19:39.137 --> 19:41.723
Gladys thinks I'm the best.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.810
No, me! I want to be the best.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.687
Gladys, Gladys, Gladys.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.730
A wood imp.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.442
That's who's been sayingall that stuff about us.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.653
Excellent work, Pony.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.491
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

19:59.575 --> 20:01.493
That wood imp is going down. That wood imp is going down.

20:03.412 --> 20:06.331
A package stolen, a friendship destroyed.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.916
What a productive day.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.211
You're gonna be in so much trouble.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.047
Me? You ruined the quest!

20:14.798 --> 20:17.426
This just gets better and better.

20:17.509 --> 20:21.680
When Gladys finds out, she's gonnakick you out of Little Rumblers.

20:21.763 --> 20:25.184
Yeah? Well, I'm a shield,and you're a curse.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.979
Your words bounce off meand curse you in reverse.

20:31.648 --> 20:35.277
I need my boiling-hot teato watch this drama boil over.

20:45.787 --> 20:49.541
Nice try, horsey,but I'm afraid you're trapped!

20:49.625 --> 20:51.001
Actually…

20:51.084 --> 20:52.628
You are!

20:55.464 --> 20:58.550
You! You tricked me.

20:59.343 --> 21:03.347
It was easy, really.It was Pinecone's idea to build a trap. It was easy, really.It was Pinecone's idea to build a trap.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.391
And Annabelle's ideato have Paragon distract you,

21:06.475 --> 21:09.353
all the while Pony got the real package.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.399
I couldn't help it.

21:15.359 --> 21:20.030
You see, my siblings are so much betterat tricking people than me.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.575
I just wanted to be the best for once.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.119
Just once.

21:35.170 --> 21:39.800
Thank you. I can't believeyou actually fell for that.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.183
Let them go. We got what we needed.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.268
You're right.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.687
And now we can complete our mission.

21:51.770 --> 21:55.983
Like bam! Package delivered.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.193
Care of Annabelle and Pinecone.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
Yeah.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.788
You know what? We make a good team.

22:10.289 --> 22:12.624
I think Gladys is gonna be pretty proud.

22:12.708 --> 22:16.670
Of course! You did an amazing job.

22:16.753 --> 22:20.132
Oh, stop. You did an amazing job.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.509
No, you.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.052
No, you.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.179
No, you.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.471
No, you!

22:26.555 --> 22:27.681
No, you.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.141
No, you!

22:29.224 --> 22:30.309
No, you!

22:30.392 --> 22:32.769
-I infinity say, "No, you!"-You, you, you, you!

22:35.480 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
