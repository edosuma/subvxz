00:07.900 --> 00:11.010

00:14.757 --> 00:18.075
- Come on, Mr. Gomillion.

00:18.093 --> 00:20.144
Time to go.

00:29.179 --> 00:31.030
(buzzer ringing)

00:38.522 --> 00:40.021

people happily shouting)

00:40.099 --> 00:42.266

00:42.710 --> 00:44.526
Put your hands in the air!

00:44.545 --> 00:46.453
Pick it up, pick it up!

00:47.106 --> 00:48.622

01:16.726 --> 01:18.226
(laughing)
- That's right.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.304
That's Winton's very own.
You saw it here first.

01:20.306 --> 01:21.972
You know how we get down.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.731
To my brothers from another
mother,

01:23.976 --> 01:27.068
doin' that thing we've been
doin' since third grade,
killing the vocals.

01:27.162 --> 01:28.495
C'mon now!
- Whoo!

01:28.572 --> 01:30.756
- Man, you was
rhyming your ass off.

01:30.833 --> 01:32.574
We just playin' out here.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.260
- Speak for yourself,
little brother.
Folks come out to see me too.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.262
(laughing)

01:38.915 --> 01:41.141
- Hmm... That was so great.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.920
- Yo, Kendall,
you're the G.O.A.T.
with them 90s lyrics, man.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.164
Every week!

01:47.349 --> 01:49.775
- Hey, Stevie, I appreciate you,
brother. Thank you.

01:49.926 --> 01:51.944
- Listen. I got laid off.
Money's kinda tight right now

01:51.946 --> 01:53.687
so if you got somethin'
at the warehouse...

01:53.763 --> 01:55.930
- Stevie, does it look like we
tryin' to talk about work now?

01:55.950 --> 01:57.524
- Ain't nobody talkin' to you,
Lamar.

01:57.601 --> 02:00.010
- No, but I'm talkin' to you.
(woman, quietly): Okay.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.621
- Stevie, give me a call
next week.

02:02.772 --> 02:04.272
Something might be opening up.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.000
- You got heart, K.
Always have.
(phone ringing)

02:07.186 --> 02:09.186
- My man.
- Hello?

02:09.188 --> 02:11.797
- That cat is always beggin'.
Always.

02:11.948 --> 02:13.857
- He's having a hard time,
Lamar.

02:13.859 --> 02:15.592
Damn.

02:18.714 --> 02:21.098
Hey, babe, what's wrong?

02:22.368 --> 02:25.385
- Amber.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Gomillion.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.463
- Mr. and Mrs. Gomillion,
Detective Douglas.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.723
We spoke earlier.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.391
- Where's our daughter?

02:31.468 --> 02:33.694
- Exam room.

02:36.215 --> 02:38.240
- Hey, Ingy, hey.

02:39.476 --> 02:42.494
Daddy's here and Mommy's
here too. You okay?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.572
- I'm sorry about the squirrel.

02:45.724 --> 02:48.725
- The... the squirrel?
What squirrel, honey?

02:48.727 --> 02:49.910
- At the park.

02:50.153 --> 02:53.839
It looked hungry and I had
some chips in my backpack.

02:54.066 --> 02:56.675
- Dr. Mendez needs
your parental consent

02:56.826 --> 02:59.052
before she can examine Ingrid.

03:01.590 --> 03:06.727
- Honey, it's okay, you can go
over there with the doctor.
We'll be right here, okay?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.337
- Now wait a minute.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.232
I need to speak with you.
- Okay.

03:18.682 --> 03:22.684
- I can only imagine how... hard
this must be for you to hear,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.871
so I'll be as direct as I can
be about what we know so far.

03:26.782 --> 03:30.767
Ingrid and the babysitter were
separated for about five minutes

03:30.786 --> 03:36.048
and in that time, a perpetrator
grabbed Ingrid from behind,

03:36.199 --> 03:38.700
pulled down her underwear

03:38.777 --> 03:40.610
and touched her genitals.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.628
- No.

03:41.705 --> 03:43.129
- Apparently

03:43.632 --> 03:47.375
the perpetrator ran away
when the babysitter
started calling Ingrid's name

03:47.453 --> 03:49.043
but we got a good description,

03:49.121 --> 03:52.147
and we're able
to put out an APB.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.126
- But you will catch him?

03:56.128 --> 03:59.154
- You will be first to know
when we do.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.997
- What the hell?

04:10.734 --> 04:12.960
It's okay, honey.

04:16.573 --> 04:18.298
- Come on.

04:21.244 --> 04:23.679
- Come on, sweetie.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.417
- Get Ingy inside.
- Okay.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.936
Excuse me.

04:31.013 --> 04:34.331
- Me and my family need some...
some space right now. Okay?

04:34.424 --> 04:36.182
- We just showing our support,
K.

04:36.259 --> 04:38.110
- I know and I appreciate it

04:38.261 --> 04:40.687
but the best way you can show
your support now is

04:40.839 --> 04:42.597
by giving us our privacy.

04:42.674 --> 04:43.931
- K.
- Alright, thanks.

04:44.009 --> 04:45.175
- No man, no.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.119
- I'll talk to him.

04:47.346 --> 04:48.678
K.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.122
K, K, wait up!

04:50.958 --> 04:54.126
- What were you thinking, Lamar,
telling everyone our business?

04:54.277 --> 04:58.112
- There are laws against
revealing the name of a child
who was assaulted.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.024
- Oh man, listen,
I wasn't thinkin'.

05:01.043 --> 05:02.208
- Clearly.

05:02.285 --> 05:04.377
Use some common sense,
just once.

05:04.530 --> 05:07.255
- Hey, Alisa, go give Ingy
her bath, alright?

05:07.290 --> 05:09.308
I'll see you in a second.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.981
Look, Alisa's...
- No. It's cool, it's cool.

05:16.132 --> 05:17.965
I get it.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.893
I get it, man.

05:20.045 --> 05:23.030
The police catch the guy
who did this?

05:23.473 --> 05:24.397
- No.

05:24.474 --> 05:27.034
They're still looking for him.

05:32.741 --> 05:35.149
- White.
- Yeah.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.578
- How serious do you think
the police are gonna treat this?

05:39.322 --> 05:41.489
I mean, if a white girl's
molested,

05:41.567 --> 05:43.342
they'd be all over it,
but one of ours?

05:43.493 --> 05:45.844
(Kendall, wearily):
Man, the detective is black.

05:45.846 --> 05:50.073
- You really need me to explain
why black and blue's a problem?

05:50.075 --> 05:54.227
- What I don't need is
this police conspiracy talk
right now, Lamar, alright?

05:55.581 --> 05:57.689
Alright, I got to go take care
of my daughter.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.067
I'll see you in the mornin'.

06:01.436 --> 06:03.344
- I'm sorry this happened.
- I know.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.364
I know you are.

06:05.849 --> 06:08.033
- Alright, brother.

06:10.095 --> 06:12.996
- The water's nice and warm,
honey.

06:15.525 --> 06:18.126
You sure you don't want
to get in?

06:19.213 --> 06:21.195
It'll make you feel better.

06:21.273 --> 06:25.175
Look at all these bubbles.
They're amazing bubbles.

06:28.371 --> 06:31.098
That's a lot of bubble bath,
isn't it?

06:33.209 --> 06:35.352
This is your favorite.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.472
You can make a big snow
bubblebath mountain.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.899
(laughs softly)

06:41.050 --> 06:44.736
These bubbles are
the best bubbles.

06:44.888 --> 06:47.814
<i>- You know if I hadn't pushed us</i>
<i> into goin' to karaoke</i>

06:47.891 --> 06:50.467
this wouldn't have happened.
- No.

06:50.469 --> 06:52.577
Let's not play the blame game.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.640
- It's my job to protect
our daughter.

06:56.658 --> 06:58.417
- It's both our job.

06:58.493 --> 07:01.044
- Yeah, but it's...
it's different for me.

07:01.905 --> 07:04.631
- Why? 'Cause you're a man?

07:06.042 --> 07:07.575
(sighs)

07:07.594 --> 07:10.128
- Because my father
showed up for me,

07:10.280 --> 07:12.079
my grandfather showed up
for him,

07:12.157 --> 07:15.183
and that's what I've been trying
to do for Ingy.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.271
- I know, baby,

07:19.498 --> 07:24.517
but beating yourself up is not
going to help her or us.

07:24.670 --> 07:25.927
- I know.

07:26.688 --> 07:30.115
- You know, I've been thinking
we should put Ingy's catechism
off 'til next year.

07:30.266 --> 07:32.525
She doesn't need that kind
of pressure right now.

07:32.678 --> 07:35.512
- No. How does she get
her First Communion

07:35.514 --> 07:37.456
without taking her final test
for catechism?

07:37.532 --> 07:39.365
She's been studying
for three months.

07:39.518 --> 07:40.792
- She can do it next year.

07:40.944 --> 07:42.961
- Except all her friends
are doing it now.

07:43.112 --> 07:46.173
It'll be worse
if she misses out.

07:47.450 --> 07:48.783
(Alisa sighs)

07:48.802 --> 07:51.219
I'm gonna get her ready
for bed.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.014
- Alright.

07:56.218 --> 07:59.335
- Please describe for the court

07:59.371 --> 08:01.721
Kendall Gomillion's behavior

08:01.798 --> 08:03.723
during your investigation.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.192
- Hmm.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.028
- Detective?

08:08.897 --> 08:12.139
- It's a complicated question.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.900
- Then I'll simplify.

08:13.977 --> 08:19.647
Would you characterize
the defendant's behavior
as aggressive?

08:19.725 --> 08:22.149
- Well, Mr. Gomillion was
a concerned father

08:22.169 --> 08:25.078
with a ten-year-old daughter
who was sexually assaulted.

08:25.747 --> 08:30.567
- Telephone records show
that he called and texted you
15 times

08:30.585 --> 08:33.920
in the eight hours following
his daughter's assault.

08:33.997 --> 08:36.756
- I probably
would have done the same.

08:36.908 --> 08:42.687
- Were you ever concerned that
his behavior would turn violent?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.599
That his obsession would lead

08:46.752 --> 08:51.363
to the aggravated homicide that
he stands accused of today?

09:03.544 --> 09:07.379
(dramatic music)

09:07.455 --> 09:10.674
(theme music)

09:24.398 --> 09:26.565
(truck hissing)

09:26.641 --> 09:29.276
(door creaking)

09:35.483 --> 09:37.592
(knocking)
- Yo.

09:37.594 --> 09:39.744
- Louise dropped these off
this morning.

09:39.821 --> 09:41.413
I don't want 'em.
- Oh.

09:41.489 --> 09:45.141
Mechell needs to sign off
on this, you mind taking it
to her?

09:45.143 --> 09:46.643
- Sure.
- Thank you.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.235
- How's Ingy doing?

09:48.313 --> 09:51.089
- She has her final catechism
tonight, she's studying.

09:51.983 --> 09:55.135
- I didn't ask you what she was
doing, I said how is she.

09:56.488 --> 09:59.322
- Man, I spent the night
watching her sleep.

09:59.324 --> 10:01.674
She had a couple of bad dreams.

10:01.827 --> 10:04.844
She was mumbling
things I couldn't understand.

10:04.996 --> 10:07.013
At the hospital they, um...

10:07.608 --> 10:10.016
...they told us that
she should see a therapist.

10:10.168 --> 10:13.570
Alisa and I are going to talk
to one later on.

10:15.357 --> 10:19.034
- Did you ever hear from your
boy, uh, Mister Detective?

10:20.103 --> 10:22.345
He's an overseer.

10:22.364 --> 10:25.498
What, Trent Douglas, right?

10:26.943 --> 10:29.777
He was there when that white cop
killed Omar Keelings.

10:29.855 --> 10:34.040
Looked the other way
when a young black man
was beat to death.

10:34.876 --> 10:36.468
Now if he didn't stand up
for Omar,

10:36.544 --> 10:38.803
what makes you think
he gonna stand up for Ingy?

10:39.455 --> 10:41.956
She ain't never gonna be
in front of mind of any of them.

10:42.033 --> 10:43.791
- It's only been 12 hours,
Lamar.

10:43.869 --> 10:46.703
- Twelve, twenty-four, man,
how much longer you gonna wait?

10:47.038 --> 10:48.629
Another day?
Another week?

10:49.298 --> 10:52.208
The only way we get justice is
by getting it ourselves.

10:52.227 --> 10:53.634
- You sound crazy.

10:53.728 --> 10:56.546
All I got to do is gather a few
of my boys down to the park,

10:56.548 --> 10:58.231
tell them to look for that
white boy and we be alright.

10:58.383 --> 11:00.717
- Damn, man, are you... are you
lookin' to go back to prison?

11:00.719 --> 11:04.120
Because that's exactly
where you headed
you talkin' like that.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.558
You're the same kid
I met on the playground,

11:08.576 --> 11:11.294
you were always
looking for a fight.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.155
- You the same, too, K.

11:14.824 --> 11:18.218
Always trying to find the good
in people that ain't there.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.057
Thanks for the donuts, man.

11:27.595 --> 11:30.188
(soft music)

11:34.510 --> 11:36.227
(line ringing)

11:36.304 --> 11:39.280
<i> - You've reached the voicemail</i>
<i> of Detective Trent Douglas.</i>

11:41.535 --> 11:43.326
- Mr. Gomillion.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.873
- I left you voicemail messages.
I've sent you texts.

11:49.025 --> 11:51.692
You haven't responded at all
so I came to see you myself.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.878
- I was hoping to have an update
for you first.

11:53.955 --> 11:55.772
- Well, do you?
Do you have any updates?

11:55.774 --> 11:58.174
- Please. Come in. Have a seat.

12:01.947 --> 12:04.889
- Mr. Gomillion,
we're canvassing the park,

12:04.999 --> 12:07.133
the neighborhood,
going through CCTV.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.376
Everything that we possibly
can be doing, we're doing.

12:09.454 --> 12:11.955
But in the meantime--
- Have you contacted
the local news

12:12.048 --> 12:13.565
so more people know
who you're looking for?

12:13.716 --> 12:15.508
- You want this guy locked up,
I get that.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.569
- I just want to make sure
you want him locked up.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.721
And I want you to tell me,
man to man,

12:20.741 --> 12:24.391
that you are not going
to look away from my daughter

12:24.469 --> 12:27.228
like you did Omar Keelings.

12:28.231 --> 12:31.416
- Because that's what everybody
said you did.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
- I'm not gonna waste
your time or mine

12:36.072 --> 12:39.424
justifying what I did
or didn't do back then.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.077
You have my word.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.505
I'm going to do everything
that can be done

12:45.657 --> 12:48.266
to find the man
who assaulted your daughter.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.603
<i> (Ingy): When we are baptized,</i>

12:51.754 --> 12:55.181
we get grace and can live
with God in heaven.

12:55.333 --> 12:59.611
However, when we sin,
we can lose our grace.

12:59.687 --> 13:05.283
If we lose our grace,
we become separated from God.

13:09.197 --> 13:11.014
- Ingy, it's okay.

13:11.032 --> 13:12.682
Let's try it again.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.626
- I don't want to.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.353
(Kendall, softly): Hey. Hey...

13:17.372 --> 13:19.130
Look at me.

13:20.116 --> 13:22.616
You've got this. Okay?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.303
Alright? Let's...
let's start again.

13:25.454 --> 13:26.638
Come on.

13:26.714 --> 13:29.098
- That's good for now, sweetie.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.717
In case you decide to wear it.

13:31.870 --> 13:34.037
- What do you mean, "in case?"

13:34.039 --> 13:36.105
- Can we talk?

13:39.060 --> 13:40.877
- You good?

13:40.895 --> 13:43.363
Okay.
I'll be right back.

13:48.053 --> 13:49.552
What's up?

13:50.055 --> 13:53.480
- She's not up to this.
- She said she was.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.000
- Because she knows
that's what you want to hear.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.669
She wants to please you.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.730
- And I'm trying to help her
through this, Alisa,
the best I can.

14:00.732 --> 14:04.067
C'mon now.
- Don't raise your voice, okay?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.870
- You're right.
You're right, I'm sorry.

14:08.756 --> 14:11.599
But look, trust me on this,
okay?

14:15.263 --> 14:17.522
Just trust me.
- Okay.

14:17.599 --> 14:20.191
(knocking)
Come in.

14:21.344 --> 14:24.195
- Uncle Lamar is here for you,
Daddy.

14:33.189 --> 14:34.372
- Oh, what's up man?

14:34.523 --> 14:36.207
Come on.
- Hey, no, come here.

14:36.434 --> 14:39.335
Come here.
I found him, K.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.632
White dude that touched Ingy.

14:47.445 --> 14:48.628
- What are you talking about?

14:48.704 --> 14:51.538
- I had David give a few of
these to my boys

14:51.616 --> 14:54.208
and they went down
to Winton Park and they...

14:54.636 --> 14:56.710
- Lamar, I told you
to leave it alone.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.138
- I know what you told me
but I found him, K.

14:59.290 --> 15:03.192
The guy on the poster,
got a tattoo on his arm.

15:07.132 --> 15:09.574
Who're you calling?
- Detective Douglas.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.910
- Man, put the phone down.
(line ringing)

15:11.986 --> 15:13.970
Hey, put it down!
(phone beeping)

15:13.988 --> 15:17.415
Before you call the police,
let's just go over there
and see if it's him.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.919
We don't want to call the police
on the wrong white dude, right?

15:20.995 --> 15:23.646
- Ingy's catechism is
in two hours.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.089
- You'll make it back in time.

15:25.241 --> 15:27.300
You'll make it back.

15:42.258 --> 15:44.591
- Hey K.
- Where is he?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.694
- Playground.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.769
- Don't tell me you lost him.

15:56.364 --> 15:59.348
- He had on a green sweatshirt.
- Seriously?!

15:59.350 --> 16:01.775
- He was there
like five minutes ago.

16:01.795 --> 16:06.005
- Then he's still here
somewhere.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.260
Spread out.
- Yeah.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.556
- Okay. Turn around.

16:23.632 --> 16:25.466
Ah...

16:25.543 --> 16:29.612
that dress looks a lot better
on you than it did on me.

16:31.065 --> 16:33.307
- Are you sure
you're up for this?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.642
'Cause if you're not, it's okay.

16:36.221 --> 16:38.979
- I could do it.
- Okay.

16:39.574 --> 16:43.126
Take it off
before it gets wrinkled, okay?

16:49.751 --> 16:52.593
(phone vibrating)

16:53.662 --> 16:55.421
- Hey, I was just about
to call you.

16:55.573 --> 16:58.257
- We're supposed to be at the
church in 20 minutes.

16:58.334 --> 17:01.853
- I know, Alisa, I'm sorry.
I'm still dealing
with this work thing.

17:02.505 --> 17:05.023
- Kendall, you're the one
who talked her into this.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.693
<i> - I know. Listen, I will meet</i>
<i> you at the church, okay?</i>

17:08.844 --> 17:10.770
(sighs)
<i> Alisa?</i>

17:10.922 --> 17:13.180
- Fine.
Hurry up.

17:13.849 --> 17:16.609
- Alright, that's it.
You have to drop me off
at the church now.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.203
- Just a couple more minutes.
- No, now.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.931
- K, I'll get you back in time.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.282
- Stop talking and keep walkin'.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.293
- Hey, hey. Wait, wait.

17:28.623 --> 17:30.339
- Hey, that's him!

17:44.622 --> 17:46.972
- Alright, I'm calling
Detective Douglas.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.550
- So he can look the other way
like he did Omar Keelings?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.645
- This us-against-the-world
business is tired, Lamar.

17:52.797 --> 17:54.480
We're not 17 anymore.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.283
- You want justice
for your daughter or not?

17:59.395 --> 18:01.037
C'mon.

18:03.566 --> 18:06.751
(groaning in effort)

18:10.481 --> 18:12.648
Check his arm!
Check his arm.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.176
(struggling sounds)

18:16.262 --> 18:19.097
- He's got the tattoo!
It's him!

18:19.599 --> 18:20.765
- No! Please!

18:20.916 --> 18:23.559
(man groaning in pain)

18:29.016 --> 18:33.027
- You know what he did.
The same thing he'll do
to someone else's daughter.

18:34.263 --> 18:36.005
Hit him!
- No. Please.

18:36.007 --> 18:37.673
- Hit him.

18:37.675 --> 18:40.067
- No, please.
Aah!

18:40.954 --> 18:44.664
- That's all you got, K?
(groaning)

18:47.201 --> 18:48.701
- Alright, enough.

18:48.853 --> 18:50.703
- Don't stop.
Don't stop!

18:50.779 --> 18:52.613
- Enough! Enough!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.132
(panting): Let's go.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.693
- That's what we do
to pedophiles!

18:57.712 --> 19:00.054
(man whimpering)

19:06.629 --> 19:09.555
- Who you callin'?
(line ringing)
Man, who you callin'?

19:09.707 --> 19:11.874
(man): Aaah!

19:11.893 --> 19:14.026
Shut up!

19:14.729 --> 19:16.045
- Hey, leave him alone.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.880
Alright, let's leave him,
let's leave him.

19:17.899 --> 19:20.658
C'mon, bro.
Leave him, man, c'mon.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.978
(all panting)

19:24.998 --> 19:26.572
Man, what the hell
were you thinkin'?

19:26.724 --> 19:29.241
- What'd you thought
I was gonna do?
Slap him on the wrist?

19:29.318 --> 19:31.060
- We did the right thing, K.

19:31.062 --> 19:33.129
We all did.

19:34.749 --> 19:37.566
- Man, come on.
Come on. Come on!

19:38.586 --> 19:42.238
<i> (man): Thank you all</i>
<i> for coming to support</i>
<i> our young people tonight,</i>

19:42.256 --> 19:47.059
but before we begin,
let's all take a deep breath.

19:50.005 --> 19:52.106
Hold it.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.433
(phone vibrating)

19:54.527 --> 19:56.510
And then let it go.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.738
(all exhaling)

20:01.534 --> 20:06.687
Now we can all enjoy the silence
of this sacred space

20:06.706 --> 20:11.617
to consider the first part
of the catechism:
Profession of Faith.

20:11.694 --> 20:16.288
Because it's faith
that defines us as a community

20:16.290 --> 20:18.716
and binds us together,

20:18.943 --> 20:22.378
especially
when bad things happen.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.616
<i> And it's our faith</i>
<i>that reminds us to trust in Him</i>

20:27.635 --> 20:31.954
<i> so that we don't have</i>
<i>to carry the pain and the anger</i>

20:31.956 --> 20:34.690
<i> that we all sometimes feel.</i>

20:37.628 --> 20:39.720
<i> What is sin?</i>

20:39.797 --> 20:42.615
Can you tell us, Ingrid?

20:43.409 --> 20:44.817
- Uh...

20:45.636 --> 20:49.472
- You can refer to your workbook
if that's easier.

20:49.474 --> 20:52.458
- It's okay, honey.
Take your time.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.423
(door creaking)

20:59.575 --> 21:01.166
- Mom, how did I do?

21:01.243 --> 21:03.261
- You did amazing tonight.

21:04.913 --> 21:08.099
Honey, go put your PJs on,
okay?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.175
- Hey, I'm...

21:10.328 --> 21:12.144
I'm so sorry, baby.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.899
Daddy had a work emergency,
Mommy told you that, right?

21:18.260 --> 21:22.521
You know, if I could have been
there I would have.

21:22.673 --> 21:24.006
- I know.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.951
- Honey, go put your PJs on,
okay?

21:27.178 --> 21:29.328
I'll be in there shortly.

21:32.608 --> 21:34.125
(sighs)
- I...

21:34.201 --> 21:36.185
I'm so sorry, Alisa.

21:36.187 --> 21:39.797
- Kendall, when you say
you're gonna show up
for that little girl in there,

21:39.874 --> 21:41.948
you show up.
- I do show up!

21:41.968 --> 21:44.543
I work very hard
for this family, Alisa.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.137
- I am not disputing that.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.865
- Every penny I earn goes
toward building a future
that we said...

21:49.884 --> 21:53.060
- I know that.
Ingy knows it too.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.023
- How was she?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.320
- She was a little bumpy
at the start,

22:02.396 --> 22:04.897
you know,
then she rallied.

22:05.049 --> 22:07.158
She was good.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.718
And I'm...

22:09.904 --> 22:12.496
I'm really happy
that you encouraged her
to go through with it.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.906
- Yeah.

22:14.483 --> 22:17.126
We're gonna be fine, Kendall.

22:23.918 --> 22:26.068
(Kendall sighs)
- Mornin'.

22:26.087 --> 22:28.495
(Ingy): Morning, sleepy head.
- Good mornin'.

22:28.573 --> 22:31.907
- Man, that was the first time
I've slept since forever.

22:31.909 --> 22:35.077
- You were just sleeping
so sound I didn't have the heart
to wake you.

22:35.096 --> 22:37.504
- Oh well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.631
Listen, I know you wanted
to take Ingrid to school,

22:39.783 --> 22:41.842
but I can take her
on the way to the hospital.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.644
- I want Daddy to drive me.

22:43.679 --> 22:47.514
- Daddy is driving you.
What are you talkin' about?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.274
(all laughing)
- Mmm...

22:49.351 --> 22:53.520
What is in these pancakes that
got them tasting so good, Momma?

22:53.598 --> 22:56.056
- Oh no, it's a secret.

22:56.058 --> 22:58.191
- Mommies don't keep secrets
from daddies.

22:58.269 --> 22:59.210
- No, they do not.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.545
- Okay, fine.
(doorbell ringing)

23:02.456 --> 23:04.773
- I'll get that.
Be right back.

23:04.775 --> 23:06.592
(whispering): Secrets...

23:11.373 --> 23:12.390
Detective.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.967
- Sorry for ambushing you
like this.

23:15.043 --> 23:15.968
Uh, may I come in?

23:16.120 --> 23:18.062
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

23:18.139 --> 23:20.106
- Thank you.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.809
Mrs. Gomillion.

23:23.961 --> 23:26.904
(chuckles)
Ingrid.
- Hi.

23:27.055 --> 23:30.724
- Can I have a word with you,
Mr. Gomillion? I won't be long.

23:30.801 --> 23:32.559
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.819
- I can take Ingrid to school.

23:33.971 --> 23:35.246
Honey, Daddy will take you
to school tomorrow.

23:35.397 --> 23:36.730
Come on.
Get your backpack.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.418
- Have a good day
at school, baby.
(Alisa): Bye.

23:41.646 --> 23:43.328
- Ingrid seems good.

23:43.481 --> 23:44.813
- Yeah, yeah.

23:44.832 --> 23:47.240
She's um... she's resilient.

23:47.318 --> 23:50.335
- Well, she's got parents
who'd do anything for her.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.930
- Well, detective,
I have to get to work soon,

23:53.081 --> 23:54.765
so do you mind telling me
what's going on?

23:54.917 --> 23:58.769
- We have news about the man
we believe assaulted
your daughter.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.831
A jogger found him late
last night in Winton Park.

24:02.833 --> 24:05.776
Unconscious, multiple
contusions all over his body.

24:05.928 --> 24:08.612
By the time the EMTs got
there...

24:09.431 --> 24:11.198
...he was dead.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.620
- Are you sure it was him?

24:16.772 --> 24:21.125
- We're still waiting for his
mother to make a positive ID.

24:21.276 --> 24:23.109
She's coming in from Cleveland.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.964
But he matches
your daughter's description.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.134
Clyde Ellman.

24:33.030 --> 24:35.264
Short-order cook.

24:40.963 --> 24:43.539
Doing that kind of harm
to a man's body

24:43.557 --> 24:46.066
takes some real anger.

24:49.714 --> 24:54.575
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

24:55.310 --> 24:56.810
- Why're you asking me?

24:56.829 --> 25:01.223
- The first question a homicide
cop asks is who's got motive.

25:01.225 --> 25:05.410
- So what you're really asking
is if I did it.

25:05.563 --> 25:07.213
- Did you?

25:09.583 --> 25:10.841
- No.

25:10.993 --> 25:12.735
Because it struck me
as a little odd

25:12.753 --> 25:16.572
when I heard you missed your
daughter's catechism last night.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.240
- How do you know that?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.184
- Father Southgate.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.837
- I was at work.
We had a work emergency.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.006
- Yeah, place must've been
on fire.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.359
I know how much
Ingrid means to you.

25:28.435 --> 25:30.435
- Well, the job pays
the mortgage.

25:30.588 --> 25:34.273
- I hear that. Yeah.
(chuckles)

25:34.349 --> 25:38.427
You have someone who can
confirm that you were at work?

25:38.429 --> 25:39.945
- Yeah. Sure.

25:40.097 --> 25:41.780
- Well, you have their contact
information?

25:41.932 --> 25:43.874
- Yeah, Lamar and David Perry.

25:44.026 --> 25:45.601
We were all
at the warehouse together.

25:45.603 --> 25:48.045
- Well, send me
their contact information.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.340
I'm good for now.

25:53.627 --> 25:56.011
- Thanks for letting me know.

25:57.965 --> 26:01.875
- Anything comes up,
you've got my number.

26:01.952 --> 26:03.602
- Yeah.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.898
(door closing)

26:07.975 --> 26:10.234
<i> - He wanted us to hear it</i>
<i> from him first</i>

26:10.385 --> 26:12.385
before we saw it on the news.

26:12.463 --> 26:14.980
- Does he know who did it
or why he was m...

26:15.057 --> 26:17.575
<i> - Uh, he didn't say</i>
<i> and I didn't ask.</i>

26:17.610 --> 26:20.578
- You didn't ask?
You're not curious?

26:20.654 --> 26:23.080
<i>Honey, you've been all over him</i>
<i> since it happened.</i>

26:23.231 --> 26:25.732
- Alisa, look, I just got
to work and I'm late.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.210
We'll talk about it later, okay?

26:29.330 --> 26:30.479
- Kendall?

26:30.497 --> 26:33.674
- Lamar, David, in my office
right now.

26:43.752 --> 26:45.644
Close the door.

26:48.515 --> 26:50.107
He's dead.

26:50.184 --> 26:52.651
The guy in the park.

26:54.596 --> 26:56.188
We killed him.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.431
Detective Douglas
came by my house.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.360
He knew about Ingy's catechism,
and he knew I wasn't there.

27:01.436 --> 27:03.011
(sighs)

27:03.030 --> 27:06.624
He even asked me point blank
if I did it.

27:06.775 --> 27:08.016
- What'd you say?

27:08.127 --> 27:10.628
- Told him I was here
at the warehouse with you two.

27:10.779 --> 27:12.779
- Okay.
Then we're good.

27:12.857 --> 27:15.874
- He's not done. He's gonna
reach out to you both.

27:16.026 --> 27:19.027
- And we'll say exactly
what you just said.

27:19.029 --> 27:20.696
- I don't know, man.

27:20.714 --> 27:23.198
I think we need to just
tell him it was an accident.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.975
I mean,
we didn't mean to kill the guy.

27:25.202 --> 27:27.645
- You think he'll believe us?
- It's the truth.

27:27.796 --> 27:32.149
- Hey, yo, that punk ass cop
can suspect all he wants.

27:32.300 --> 27:36.070
If he had any real evidence,
you'd already be locked up.

27:37.898 --> 27:40.157
- I ain't goin' back to prison.

27:40.234 --> 27:43.077
I'll die before I go back.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.238
- We... we killed a man.

27:46.314 --> 27:48.148
- A man who needed killing.

27:48.225 --> 27:51.317
Who molested your daughter!
- Put a pause on that, Lamar.

27:52.062 --> 27:54.171
All this talk about the police,

27:54.248 --> 27:56.322
and me defending my daughter
and gettin' her justice,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.158
that's why we're into this
right now.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.568
- So now you puttin' this on me?

27:59.737 --> 28:02.721
- Yeah, I'm puttin' it on you.
- Stop it. Both of you!

28:04.350 --> 28:07.685
The last thing we need is
to be gettin' at each other.

28:10.764 --> 28:14.316
- You know what?
He's right, K.

28:15.619 --> 28:19.254
Listen, we just stick
to our stories,

28:19.256 --> 28:22.441
watch each other's backs,
and this'll all blow over.

28:22.593 --> 28:24.326
Okay?

28:26.947 --> 28:28.447
Trust me.

28:28.599 --> 28:30.165
Okay?

28:36.865 --> 28:38.507
- Yeah.
- We good?

28:42.296 --> 28:44.037
- Dear Lord Jesus Christ,

28:44.131 --> 28:47.132
when I am uncertain
what I should do,

28:47.209 --> 28:49.393
guide me
along your path.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.637
Help me to be attentive
to your voice

28:52.790 --> 28:55.507
as you guide me through life.

28:55.659 --> 28:57.217
For you are my Savior,

28:57.294 --> 29:00.386
you have rescued me from sin.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.722
Shine the light of your love
into me.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.226
Bring clarity to my mind

29:06.303 --> 29:08.303
through your mighty name.

29:08.322 --> 29:10.247
Amen.
(congregants): Amen.

29:10.398 --> 29:11.898
- I just left your house.

29:11.976 --> 29:13.417
(Father Southgate):
Show me how...

29:13.568 --> 29:15.735
- Your wife said
I might find you here.

29:15.755 --> 29:19.831
(Father Southgate): Protect me
from darkness and dispair.

29:19.908 --> 29:23.677
We look to you
to find the true way.

29:26.748 --> 29:28.340
- You went to my house?

29:28.492 --> 29:30.158
- After I talked to your boys.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.769
You all go way back, huh?

29:31.845 --> 29:33.345
- We grew up together.

29:33.421 --> 29:35.606
- Yeah, they said what you said.

29:35.757 --> 29:38.016
That you were all together

29:38.168 --> 29:40.611
when Clyde Ellman
was beaten to death.

29:41.505 --> 29:43.672
- Cool, then what else
do you need to hear?

29:43.765 --> 29:46.191
- How about the truth?

29:47.177 --> 29:49.953
I get this whole
Three-Musketeer loyalty thing,

29:50.030 --> 29:55.534
but you don't need me
to tell you that Lamar's
spinning in circles,

29:55.686 --> 29:56.794
going nowhere?

29:56.945 --> 29:59.354
And his brother, David, c'mon...

29:59.356 --> 30:02.007
is he always so jittery?

30:04.028 --> 30:06.619
- Cops make black men nervous.

30:06.697 --> 30:08.764
You should know that.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.142
- Here's what I do know.

30:12.719 --> 30:15.962
Three people telling the same
story doesn't make it true.

30:16.707 --> 30:19.316
But it does make it easier
to take that story apart.

30:19.434 --> 30:22.653
Reading people, that's my job.

30:23.747 --> 30:25.063
And my read is,

30:25.140 --> 30:29.993
you're a good man
caught up in a bad situation.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.739
- I told you before...

30:34.892 --> 30:35.999
- And I am telling you now,

30:36.151 --> 30:39.077
if the law cuts you
any slack at all,

30:39.229 --> 30:41.672
it'll be because you told me
what happened that night.

30:41.748 --> 30:43.415
What really happened.

30:43.567 --> 30:47.719
I am your last best chance
to get through this.

30:50.908 --> 30:53.925
The forensic report
comes in tomorrow.

30:54.002 --> 30:57.579
And there's no way that
a beating like
that doesn't have hard evidence.

30:57.581 --> 31:00.098
So whoever did this
will go down.

31:00.175 --> 31:03.768
The only question is
how hard they fall.

31:03.921 --> 31:06.363
So let me help you,
Mr. Gomillion.

31:07.015 --> 31:09.015
And who knows?

31:09.517 --> 31:13.161
Maybe you'll even get to walk
Ingrid down the aisle.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.083
- I told you already.

31:20.195 --> 31:22.713
I had a work emergency.

31:47.314 --> 31:50.991
- Yo, you think Kendall
told him?

31:55.581 --> 31:58.707
(crickets chirring)

32:06.500 --> 32:07.674
(groaning in pain)

32:09.762 --> 32:13.096
(struggling sounds)
(Kendall takes a deep breath.)

32:18.604 --> 32:20.979
(door creaking)

32:28.021 --> 32:30.972
- I've been calling you
for three hours.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.100
- I thought you...
you'd be sleeping,

32:34.178 --> 32:35.619
I didn't want to wake you.

32:35.770 --> 32:38.288
- You thought I'd be sleeping?

32:39.959 --> 32:42.108
Now tell me why that detective
came here a second time

32:42.202 --> 32:44.352
and why weren't you
answering your phone.

32:44.354 --> 32:48.131
And Kendall, please don't even
think of lying to me.

32:49.526 --> 32:51.426
- I wasn't at work.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.723
The night of Ingy's catechism...

32:59.553 --> 33:04.648
I was with Lamar and David
in Winton Park...

33:06.819 --> 33:10.470
...because they said
they had found the man
who molested Ingrid.

33:10.547 --> 33:12.322
- Oh God, Kendall.

33:14.568 --> 33:17.995
- I only went down there
to make sure it was really him.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.724
You know Lamar loves
to stretch the truth.

33:23.168 --> 33:26.244
So we were just gonna hold him
until the police came

33:26.396 --> 33:28.672
but then he started running...

33:29.399 --> 33:30.841
and we chased him down

33:31.068 --> 33:33.719
and Lamar started beating him.

33:34.662 --> 33:37.055
- You didn't stop him?

33:39.184 --> 33:41.309
Did you even try?

33:43.247 --> 33:47.749
- Lamar had me so wound up
about what that man did
to our little girl,

33:47.751 --> 33:50.009
I started hittin' him too.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.770
- Oh, Kendall, no.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.656
(crying): And it felt good.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.534
Until it didn't.

33:57.685 --> 34:01.187
And I stopped and
I swear to you, Alisa,

34:01.265 --> 34:03.999
I swear on my life,
the man wasn't that bad.

34:04.526 --> 34:05.691
(sniffling)

34:05.769 --> 34:08.620
But then Lamar,
he kept kicking him

34:08.772 --> 34:10.530
and he wouldn't stop.

34:11.699 --> 34:15.385
And it took me and David
to both pull him off the man,

34:15.537 --> 34:18.388
and even then
I didn't think he was...

34:18.465 --> 34:20.640
(crying)

34:21.376 --> 34:23.143
- Kendall.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.123
- I went to...

34:28.125 --> 34:32.310
Father Southgate,
to ask him what I should do.

34:33.130 --> 34:36.239
I couldn't bring myself
to tell him.

34:36.891 --> 34:38.967
So I just kept walking

34:38.985 --> 34:42.079
and I wound up in Winton Park.

34:46.827 --> 34:48.568
- Okay. You know what?

34:48.587 --> 34:51.421
It's... it's...
it's gonna be alright, baby.

34:51.498 --> 34:52.738
Okay.

34:52.816 --> 34:54.833
You listen to me,

34:54.927 --> 34:59.179
you're gonna tell
that detective
everything you just told me.

35:00.507 --> 35:02.099
- I can't.

35:02.175 --> 35:04.434
I can't do it, Alisa.

35:04.586 --> 35:07.512
Me, Lamar and David,
we said we were together.

35:07.589 --> 35:09.848
We were each other's alibis.
- No. No!

35:09.924 --> 35:12.442
Lamar took that man's life,
not you.

35:12.594 --> 35:15.695
He took a life
that wasn't his to take.

35:17.098 --> 35:19.599
- Lamar will die
if he goes back to prison.

35:19.676 --> 35:21.343
- And is he wor...

35:21.345 --> 35:23.862
is he worth your daughter
growing up without a father?

35:24.014 --> 35:26.289
- He's my best friend, Alisa.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.868
- Lamar has not been your friend
in a long time.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.110
You give and he takes.

35:31.204 --> 35:33.705
And now he's made you
an accessory to murder.

35:33.857 --> 35:37.175
- Stop yelling.
You woke me up.

35:40.697 --> 35:43.306
- Hey, I'm sorry, sweetie.

35:46.794 --> 35:50.147
Alright, just go back to bed,
okay? It's okay.

35:51.558 --> 35:53.191
It's okay.

36:03.236 --> 36:05.478
- No, Father, I'm... I'm fine.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.979
I'll be fine.

36:07.057 --> 36:09.240
<i> - I'll be here if you need me.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

36:09.317 --> 36:11.226
Thanks.
<i> - Goodbye.</i>

36:11.244 --> 36:14.320
- Uh, Father Southgate has to
give someone their last rites.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.915
But we're gonna go in
without him

36:17.067 --> 36:19.009
and he'll get here
when he gets here.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.510
- Okay.
- Alright.

36:20.662 --> 36:22.253
- Alright.

36:22.330 --> 36:25.056
(indistinct chatter)

36:26.092 --> 36:27.726
(Alisa): Okay.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.353
- Excuse me.

36:30.505 --> 36:33.005
We're here to see
Detective Douglas.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.708
Kendall Gomillion.

36:34.710 --> 36:37.235
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

36:41.942 --> 36:43.366
- Hey...

36:45.019 --> 36:46.852
...you know
that your whole life,

36:46.930 --> 36:48.780
you've done
everything right.

36:48.932 --> 36:50.932
Except this... this one time

36:50.951 --> 36:53.268
and you are making it right.

36:53.286 --> 36:55.545
You know you are doing
the right thing.

36:55.697 --> 36:58.122
- I can't have Ingy hating me.

36:58.275 --> 37:00.275
- Uh! She will never hate you.

37:00.277 --> 37:03.127
She will understand
that her daddy made a mistake,

37:03.280 --> 37:06.614
and that he did the right thing
by facing up to it.

37:06.633 --> 37:09.875
She may not get it right away,
but she will in time.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.837
I will make sure of that, baby.

37:12.989 --> 37:14.880
Okay?
I promise.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.193
- Thank you.
- I love you.

37:21.014 --> 37:23.990
Hey, sweetie.
(Detective clears throat)

37:27.746 --> 37:31.990
- Uh, hey, detective,
uh, listen,

37:32.142 --> 37:35.326
I... I wasn't forthcoming
earlier

37:35.403 --> 37:38.663
but I am here
to set the record straight.

37:38.815 --> 37:42.850
I'm willing to take
whatever I've got coming to me.

37:42.852 --> 37:47.347
I'm just hoping that you can
help me like you said.

37:50.102 --> 37:53.228
I'm not sure
I can help you anymore.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.255
- Wha... what do you mean?

37:56.275 --> 37:58.016
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Gomillion.

37:58.092 --> 38:00.518
I really tried to help.
I really tried.

38:00.595 --> 38:02.612
- Wait, wait,
I don't understand.

38:02.764 --> 38:04.698
What changed?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.269
What did...
what did he tell you?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.955
What... what did you tell them?

38:12.182 --> 38:14.532
- Mr. Gomillion,
you're under arrest
for the murder of Clyde Ellman.

38:14.609 --> 38:15.941
(Alisa): No!
- What did he tell you?

38:15.961 --> 38:17.852
- Officer Martin will read you
your Miranda Rights.

38:17.871 --> 38:20.538
- You have the right
to remain silent...
- Lamar, what did you tell him?

38:21.282 --> 38:23.691
- Kendall was real messed up
after what happened to Ingrid

38:23.693 --> 38:26.653
and... and... and he kept
talkin' about

38:26.729 --> 38:28.212
how the police
wasn't gonna do anything,

38:28.365 --> 38:32.291
and he had to... to... to...
take control of things himself.

38:32.385 --> 38:35.979
- By hunting down Clyde Ellman
and beating him to death?

38:36.130 --> 38:38.556
- Nah... He told us

38:38.633 --> 38:40.875
that he just wanted
to hold onto the man

38:40.877 --> 38:42.652
until the police came but...

38:42.804 --> 38:45.447
- He beat him to death instead.

38:48.476 --> 38:50.243
- Mr. Mingoe?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.663
- Yeah.

38:55.075 --> 38:58.043
Yeah, he... he...
he beat him to death.

39:03.658 --> 39:07.159
- I'll bring you in as soon as
your lawyer gets here.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.763
- Thank you, Detective.

39:12.834 --> 39:16.578
- A friend who has given y'all
as much as Kendall has,

39:16.596 --> 39:18.913
it must be hard,

39:18.932 --> 39:21.274
turning in a friend like that.

39:22.510 --> 39:24.361
- It's hard as hell.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.157
- I'll call your lawyer.

39:35.189 --> 39:37.374
(door creaking)

39:38.377 --> 39:40.293
(door closing)

39:44.332 --> 39:46.608
- You know this ain't right,
man.

39:46.610 --> 39:49.177
- It was him or me.

39:50.204 --> 39:51.779
- What about Ingrid?

39:52.616 --> 39:54.799
What about Alisa?
- What about me?

39:55.727 --> 39:59.062
I'm your brother.
You keep talkin' about Kendall.

40:00.290 --> 40:02.399
What about your blood?

40:04.236 --> 40:09.147
- We've heard from Detective
Douglas and your brother

40:09.299 --> 40:12.892
about Mr. Gomillion's anger
and obsession.

40:12.953 --> 40:17.080
Is that how you would
characterize Mr. Gomillion's
state of mind?

40:18.308 --> 40:20.750
- Yes, sir.
- And yet

40:20.902 --> 40:23.753
you believed him
when he told you
that all he wanted to do

40:23.830 --> 40:27.298
was detain Mr. Ellman
until the police arrived.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.093
- I did.
- Why?

40:30.762 --> 40:33.613
- Well, Kendall's always been
true to his word.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.492
I mean, the man has
23 people working for him,

40:37.552 --> 40:41.862
never misses church,
owns his own home,

40:41.864 --> 40:44.423
so when he went after that man
like a pitbull,

40:44.501 --> 40:46.167
I didn't know what--
- That's a lie.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.278
- I won't tolerate any
disruptions in my courtroom.

40:48.429 --> 40:50.113
- But you'll tolerate his lies?

40:50.857 --> 40:53.024
- Counsel, please continue.

40:53.176 --> 40:54.767
- Thank you, Your Honor.

40:56.012 --> 41:00.373
Can you tell the court why
you covered for Mr. Gomillion?

41:01.609 --> 41:03.201
- I was scared.

41:03.277 --> 41:05.295
- Scared?
- Yeah.

41:05.872 --> 41:08.039
After I saw
what he was capable of,

41:08.115 --> 41:10.467
I didn't want to take any risks
at betraying him.

41:10.618 --> 41:12.043
- You lying son of a...

41:12.195 --> 41:13.285
(gavel banging)
Order.

41:13.363 --> 41:14.787
- I will kill you.
- Kendall, no!

41:14.864 --> 41:15.972
- You hear me.
- Please!

41:16.199 --> 41:18.382
- I will kill you, Lamar!
I'll kill you, Lamar.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.202
I swear it.
I will kill you, you hear me.

41:21.295 --> 41:22.870
This is my family, Lamar!

41:22.872 --> 41:25.540
- This court is adjourned until
I have order in my courtroom!

41:25.542 --> 41:28.543
- You did this, Lamar.
This is my family!

41:28.545 --> 41:29.877
I will kill you.

41:29.896 --> 41:31.896
Do you hear me?
I will kill you.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.157
- Calm down, sir.
(Kendall): I will kill you.

41:34.308 --> 41:36.551
You did this.
(crying)

41:36.553 --> 41:39.120
(handcuffs rattling)

41:41.558 --> 41:43.166
- Alright, let's go.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.502
- C.P.D.

41:46.913 --> 41:51.966
Officers, I'd like to have
a moment with Mr. Gomillion.

41:58.758 --> 42:00.624
I believe you, Kendall.

42:01.261 --> 42:04.837
I believe your friends lied,
and I believe you told the truth

42:04.914 --> 42:08.650
but you just had too many things
workin' against you.

42:10.195 --> 42:14.531
- I should've taken the chance
you gave me, so it's on me.

42:14.682 --> 42:17.617
- Ah no, we all make mistakes.
All of us.

42:18.611 --> 42:21.186
I looked away once

42:21.264 --> 42:23.614
and a young black man

42:23.767 --> 42:25.750
paid the price.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.607
Omar Keelings...

42:34.277 --> 42:38.429
He never got justice because
I looked away and I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

42:40.225 --> 42:43.134
I'm gonna keep looking
until I break that story.

42:43.286 --> 42:46.688
Until I find whatever I need
to find to make this right.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.317
You have my word.

42:57.133 --> 43:00.326
I'll do what I can for him.
- Thank you.
