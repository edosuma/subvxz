Welcome to your new

Oh, my God.

03:49.708 --> 03:53.000
Walk with me, if you will,
into your bedroom.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.750
Okay, imagine,
if you would, right,
Sunday morning.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.959
Oh, my God.

03:58.959 --> 04:01.625
You're lying in bed
browsing podcasts.

04:01.625 --> 04:05.792
Meanwhile, on the other
side of this wall,

04:05.792 --> 04:09.166
unbeknownst to you,
guess who's in the
studio/kitchen

04:09.166 --> 04:12.500
practicing fingerpicking
and making you chilaquiles.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
Come on, you know
how you're always talking
about how we need more space.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I definitely said
I wanted more space.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.166
And yet somehow now
I have less space

04:20.166 --> 04:22.000
because there's
a giant fucking wall

04:22.000 --> 04:23.542
in the middle
of my apartment.

04:23.542 --> 04:26.708
Well, yes, if you
think about it

04:26.708 --> 04:29.083
in terms of technical
square footage...

04:29.083 --> 04:30.792
- Yeah.
- ...then you are correct,

04:30.792 --> 04:32.667
but we will have
more privacy,

04:32.667 --> 04:35.000
which is what you meant
when you said more space.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.333
No, it's not.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.291
I literally meant
that I needed more space.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.500
( sighs )
How much is this
gonna cost us?

04:44.500 --> 04:46.417
Like, nothing.
I mean, nothing.

04:46.417 --> 04:47.875
We're getting
a seriously good deal.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.750
I mean, the wall
pretty much pays
for itself.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.542
Okay, how?

04:52.542 --> 04:55.959
Okay, well, you know
how you always go into
the coffee shop to work

04:55.959 --> 04:58.583
and you have
to keep buying tea so that
they don't kick you out?

04:58.583 --> 05:00.542
Well, that costs
a lot of money, Marn.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.417
Actually,
three grand a year.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.208
So in a little
more than a year,
this will be all paid off.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.583
- That is insane.
- Don't call me insane.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.333
You know my mother
used to call me insane.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.333
I did not call you insane.
I said, "That  is insane."

05:12.333 --> 05:14.875
What is this?
This is a crazy
tiny little shelf.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.083

put on this shelf?

05:19.542 --> 05:22.250
Excuse me.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.041
- That's a custom shelf...
- Oh.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.542
...for my Ray Bradbury
Digest collection.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.208
Oh, my God.
I see how it is.

05:27.208 --> 05:28.625
- What?
- This is all for you.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.041
This is all
for fuckin' you.

05:30.041 --> 05:32.291
No, Marnie,
this is all for you!

05:32.291 --> 05:36.083
Actually, all I have
is a teensy fucking
tiny Digest shelf.

05:36.083 --> 05:39.208
- No, you do what you want
when you want...
- You're good.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.750
...how you wanna do it
and it's like I don't
even fucking exist.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.041
- Excuse me.
- Have you seen-- no, you're
good, bro, you're good.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.875
Are you kidding me?
You're gonna walk out?

05:45.875 --> 05:47.250
- Yeah.
- ( door slams )

05:47.250 --> 05:50.125
Keep walking.
( exhales sharply )

05:50.125 --> 05:51.834
Man.

05:51.834 --> 05:55.291
This is no reflection
on your work, all right?

05:55.291 --> 05:59.625
I pushed that double stroller
for two miles up a fucking hill.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.417
The twins were crying
and I just--

06:02.417 --> 06:07.291
I told them to shut up
because I was concentrating
on not having a drink.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.417
I hate motherhood.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.792
I know I'm supposed
to love it, but I don't.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.667

So, um,
I'm still breast-feeding,
not by choice.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.250
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.792
You don't usually go
to this meeting.

06:43.792 --> 06:46.792
What, are you stalking me?
Seriously, chill.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.125
I was in the neighborhood.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.458
Since when are you ever
in fucking Tribeca?

06:50.458 --> 06:52.959
The only reason to come here
is to pickpocket a yuppie.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.417
Oh, yeah, by the way.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.083
Here you go.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.667
Practicing
for an audition.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.917
You didn't.
( gasps )

07:00.917 --> 07:04.166

07:07.834 --> 07:09.834
Yeah, I need sisterhood.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, well, these are
meetings I can't go to.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.792
And you're not returning
any of my texts.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.583
They're barely sentences.
"You need eat"?

07:17.583 --> 07:19.333
What-- that doesn't
even make any sense.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.959
Why the fuck
are you avoiding me?

07:20.959 --> 07:22.625
Because it's a horrid idea

07:22.625 --> 07:25.333
and because I'm focused
on my studies and because...

07:25.333 --> 07:26.583
you smell like ham.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.500
Oh, and you
fuckin' love it.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.083
And because of Hannah.

07:31.083 --> 07:34.000
- I'm sorry. I'm so--
- Oh, fuckin' balls!

07:34.000 --> 07:36.583
You know she wouldn't
do the same thing if she
was in your position.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.375
She'd just throw herself
right at whatever she wanted.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.333
Unlike you.
You're a pussy.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.500
I didn't say
I liked her!

07:51.875 --> 07:54.834
That's how I got
pregnant, so, careful.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.750
Look at them over there.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.708
Crawling over each other
for a chance to sip

08:00.708 --> 08:05.000
that million-dollar
lidless coffee.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.834
While in here,
my world is crumbling.

08:06.834 --> 08:11.500
Silently, relentlessly
crumbling.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.625
Excuse me, sir,
would you like
another scone?

08:13.625 --> 08:17.708
- ( music playing softly )
- Sir?

08:17.708 --> 08:19.375
Gonna throw
them out anyway.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.417
Do you even care?

08:21.417 --> 08:24.792
Do you give one flying fuck
about my economic decimation?

08:24.792 --> 08:26.041
Yeah, a little.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.458
Ray:
A little.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.166
Spiritually, how am I
supposed to negotiate

08:30.166 --> 08:32.667
with a society
that rewards those
shaggy-haired dickholes?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.041
Tell me.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.958
'Cause I can't.
I don't know how to.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.207
You know--
what the fuck
are you doing?

08:38.207 --> 08:40.375
I'm trying to see
if there's hair
on my lower back.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.917
I feel like there is,
but it's very--
it's very subtle.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.291
Let me take a look.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.542
Wow, it's like
a baby's bottom.

08:48.542 --> 08:49.625
Very smooth.
You wax?

08:49.625 --> 08:51.125
No, never.
Just very lucky.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.708
Yeah, my lower back
tends to get a little bushy

08:53.708 --> 08:55.000
if I neglect to prune it.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.708
Well,
you just never know
when new hair

08:56.708 --> 08:58.500
is gonna start sprouting out
of someplace on your body.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.083
- I know.
- I mean, you know.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.708
So I can only presume
you have a hot date tonight?

09:02.708 --> 09:06.625
Uh, yeah, let's just say
that I'd like my lower back
to make a good impression.

09:06.625 --> 09:09.458
- ( chuckles )
- Who's the lucky guy?

09:09.458 --> 09:12.417
Ray, I'm sorry,
but I really shouldn't say.

09:12.417 --> 09:15.125
He's, um--
he's quite famous.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.583
Dill Harcourt.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.708
Let's not make
a big deal out
of this, okay?

09:23.708 --> 09:25.542
I didn't say a word.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.792
It's just gonna be
just a very simple,

09:27.792 --> 09:30.500
small dinner party
at Lattanzi.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.083
What the fuck is that?

09:32.083 --> 09:35.834
Ray,
Lattanzi is a very famous
Theater District eatery.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.542
It's just very stressful
for me because

09:37.542 --> 09:39.792
Dill has so many celebrated
and influential friends.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.625
It's hard to say
who could be there.

09:41.625 --> 09:45.000
It might be Diane Sawyer,
Graydon Carter.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.834
He was texting
with Amanda Knox
the other day.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.166
Didn't she kill someone?

09:49.166 --> 09:50.208
No.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.708
- Maybe.
- ( groans )

09:51.708 --> 09:54.625
Patty Clarkson.
I saw-- I saw them

09:54.625 --> 09:56.834
in a magazine once
together.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.708
Her friends
call her Patty.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.583
Patty Clarkson.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.166
( indistinct chatter )

10:08.834 --> 10:10.500
Hey, Maile.
What's up?

10:11.917 --> 10:14.125
What happened
to my poem?

10:14.125 --> 10:16.166
( sighs )

10:17.333 --> 10:20.291
Does it look weird
to you or is it...?

10:20.291 --> 10:23.000
There's actually
a lot of weird instances

10:23.000 --> 10:25.333
where the first lady
and the president
don't even sleep

10:25.333 --> 10:27.250
in the same bedroom,
which is--

10:27.250 --> 10:30.083
- ( knocks )
- People don't--

10:32.542 --> 10:35.041
Excuse me
for one moment.

10:37.708 --> 10:40.291
What the hell?
You cannot just interrupt
a class like that.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.750
She needs answers.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.083
Come here.

10:48.708 --> 10:50.375
All right.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.208
Do I know you?

10:53.375 --> 10:56.542
Oh, yeah.
Um...

10:56.542 --> 10:58.250
I really liked
your poem.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.041
No, he didn't.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.917
Hannah, this is
wildly inappropriate.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.083
Oh, come on, all I did
was interrupt your class.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.458
It's not that big a deal.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.125
Um, actually, it is.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.417
I think what
was inappropriate

11:08.417 --> 11:10.625
was what happened
last night.

11:10.625 --> 11:13.333
Um, what does this
have to do with my poem?

11:13.333 --> 11:16.625
Well, Mr. Parker, aka Fran,
aka my boyfriend,

11:16.625 --> 11:18.166
didn't like how I was
correcting your poem,

11:18.166 --> 11:19.959
so he decided to take it
into his own damn hands.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.542
( scoffs )
Okay, "Mail."

11:22.542 --> 11:25.625
Her name is Maile.
"Miley."

11:25.625 --> 11:27.500
Hannah was not
correcting the grammar

11:27.500 --> 11:30.291
and I thought
it was important for you
to learn proper English.

11:30.291 --> 11:33.000
Listen, Fran,
proper English
is a joke.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.959
In 10 years,
we're all gonna be robots
who speak Chinese, okay?

11:35.959 --> 11:39.291
So why don't you
apologize for what you did
to this piece of paper?

11:39.291 --> 11:41.875
I didn't rip it.
I may have written
some stuff on there,

11:41.875 --> 11:42.959
but the rips were all her.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.834
- She did the rips.
- He did the rips.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.875
He ripped the shit
out of this piece of paper.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.333
I-- I really think
I should be in my next class.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.125
- Fran: Yes.
- Oh, you're not
going anywhere, missy.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.250
You started this
and you'll finish it.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.417
I just wrote a poem
and an essay

11:55.417 --> 11:58.291
on its literary antecedents
like you said to.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.542
Look what you did.

12:01.542 --> 12:02.917
- What I did?
- Yeah.

12:02.917 --> 12:06.000
Hannah, you are
being too much.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.708
Oh, okay.
Well, for someone who
likes corrections so much,

12:08.708 --> 12:11.125
I'm gonna issue
a big fat one
in your direction.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.959
- Great.
- I'm not being too much.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.583
I'm being just enough.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.750
You know what?
I have a class I'm
supposed to be teaching.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.583
Well, why don't
you enjoy...

12:18.583 --> 12:22.583
with the blood
of this child
on your hands?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.667
Hey.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.041
Hi.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.333
What you doing?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.500
Oh, nothing.
Just hiding from Desi.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.375
Great, 'cause
I'm hiding from Fran.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.083
Marnie:
I'm never going back
to that apartment.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.834
Guys, you cannot
stay here indefinitely.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.625
I have so much
studying to do.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.500
What you lookin' at?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.083
The Old Loves Tumblr.
It's the best.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.834
- Do you know it?
- Yeah.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.667
Oh, yeah, that's
the old people having sex.
I love that one.

13:01.667 --> 13:05.333
Nope, it's just famous people
who used to be couples that
we all forgot about,

13:05.333 --> 13:07.125
like Val Kilmer and Cher.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.667
They were a really good couple,
but she also seemed
so much happier

13:09.667 --> 13:11.667
with Rob Camilletti,
that bagel boy.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.083
Yeah.
I mean, they all
look super happy.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.917
Then I guess something
just goes wrong.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.041
Maybe nothing went wrong.
Maybe the relationship

13:18.041 --> 13:19.834
just lasted
for the amount of time
it was supposed to.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.166
Maybe all relationships have,
like, a finite life span,

13:22.166 --> 13:24.708
like Whoopi Goldberg
and Ted Danson.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.875
Or Fran and me.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.166
Hannah, I don't even
know what's going on
with you and Fran,

13:29.166 --> 13:30.667
but I'm assuming
he's right.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.166
He actually isn't right.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.583
Well, just work it out
because he's a really good guy.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.083
He's actually not
a good guy, Marnie.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.500
He's a seemingly
good guy.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.041
Okay, well,
that's a step up.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.375
I mean, Adam
didn't even seem
like a good guy.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.250
Hannah:
Adam was actually
more sane than Fran.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.083
He was just in the body
of a psychopath.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.375
Jessa:
Actually, that's not true.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.625
Adam's completely insane.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.208
And he's bowlegged.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.208
Just disgusting.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.083
The worst thing about Fran
is that he has this
prescribed idea

13:57.083 --> 13:58.667
about how I should act
in any given situation.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.083
When I don't fulfill
his expectations,

14:01.083 --> 14:03.583
he judges me.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.750
- Oh, my God,
that's horrible.
- Thank you.

14:06.750 --> 14:10.083
No, that's exactly
what I'm doing to Desi.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.375
I'm the one building
the fucking wall.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.708
I have to go
apologize to him.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.417
I don't understand.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.333
Don't break up
with Fran, okay?

14:18.333 --> 14:21.333
Or else you're just
gonna have to start over
with somebody new.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.250
People who work on things
stay together.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.500
Otherwise, you're gonna
end up alone.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.959
Like Cher.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.750
( door opens, closes )

14:30.750 --> 14:33.208
Can't I end up alone,
but not like Cher?

14:33.208 --> 14:36.125
You're already
like Cher.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.041
I'm gonna choose to take that
as a compliment.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.458
This is one
of my favorite places.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.500
- It's very intimate.
- Very.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.041
You know,
when I was a kid,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.792
I created a very intimate
cocktail lounge in my bedroom

14:48.792 --> 14:52.166
by putting a bulletin board
against the wall and squatting
underneath it.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.750
- It was called Chez Bird.
- ( both laugh )

14:55.750 --> 14:57.834
I was the headliner.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.083
- Every night.
- Every night.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.959
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.959
I'm very nervous right now.
I'm sorry.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.959
You have nothing
to be nervous about.
Everybody gets nervous.

15:07.959 --> 15:09.458
- I get nervous.
- Really?

15:09.458 --> 15:14.834
In second grade,
I peed my pants before
I had to go onstage.

15:14.834 --> 15:18.834
So the last time
you got nervous
was 35 years ago?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.250
( both laugh )

15:24.250 --> 15:27.500
I bet you were
a cute kid.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.458
Come on, you've seen
the pictures.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.125
They're all over
the Internet,

15:31.125 --> 15:36.166
especially now
that my aunt sold them
to pay her Oxy dealer.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.834
I did see a couple
in "Vanity Fair."

15:38.834 --> 15:40.625
- And "Elle Girl."
- Mm-hmm.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, there's
some good things

15:42.458 --> 15:44.959
and some bad things
about fame.

15:44.959 --> 15:49.291
I've been forced
to assemble a team
that can handle the bad.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.500
Dill, are you
threatening me?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.959
You try to fuck with me,
you're toast.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.291
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.208
Sort of.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.208
That was scary.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.708
You keep looking
to the door.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.208
Do I?

16:05.208 --> 16:10.083
I'm sorry, I, um--
you know, I thought
we were meeting people,

16:10.083 --> 16:14.041
so I sort of had
my "I'm meeting people" hat on.

16:14.041 --> 16:18.625
But, um-- look, if this
is the type of thing

16:18.625 --> 16:22.083
where I don't
meet your friends...

16:22.083 --> 16:26.667
I could, um--
I could be okay with that.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.792
You shouldn't be.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.208
Man:
Dill!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.625
- Rob.
- Hey. Sorry we're late.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.667
Dill:
Sit down.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.959
( Desi yelling )

16:51.792 --> 16:52.917
Desi?

16:52.917 --> 16:55.917
Stupid fucking
little hammer.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.250
Why do we even have
this little hammer?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.750
Because my mom
gave it to me
my freshman year.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.834
Hey, hey.
Do not do this for me.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.208
I'm doing this
for me, Marn.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.791
I'm doing this for me.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.250
Desi, I like the wall.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.416
- This fuck--
- I do. Hey, hey, hey.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.165
This fucking idea's
so fucking stupid.

17:14.165 --> 17:18.083
No, no, it's not.
Look, I'm in our bedroom.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.750
This is our bedroom.

17:19.750 --> 17:20.959
It's stupid.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.333
- Hey.
- I'm such a fucking idiot.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.625
All my ideas
are so fucking stupid.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.834
No, they're not.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.875
You are a brilliant,
creative genius, okay?

17:28.875 --> 17:30.625
- ( scoffs )
- Seriously.

17:30.625 --> 17:36.125
And if I have ever
made you feel otherwise,
then that is on me.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.959
- You mean it?
- Yeah...

17:40.917 --> 17:42.917
I mean it.

17:42.917 --> 17:47.583
I don't know why, like,
I'm trying to impress you
all the time.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.542
I feel so fucking
insecure.

17:50.542 --> 17:54.792
That's because I pick.
I pick at people.

17:54.792 --> 17:57.291
I don't know why I do it.
It sucks, but I do.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.250
- No, Marnie, you're--
- You're perfect.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.959
No, you're perfect.
You're like this...

18:01.959 --> 18:04.667
shooting star
and I'm a rat
in the gutter.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.291
Shh, shh, shh.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.667
No, you're not.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.333
- Yes, I am.
- No.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.667
I love you.

18:14.667 --> 18:15.834
I need you.

18:15.834 --> 18:18.250
I'm, like, so lost
when you go away.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.834
Shh, shh.

18:21.708 --> 18:25.500
I can't even fucking
get this stupid fucking
tank top off!

18:25.500 --> 18:27.625
Take your time.
Take your time.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.417
- You're okay.
- I'm sorry.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.750
Don't worry.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.083
Thanks for
coming out with me.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.708
You said you would
cut off my hair

18:34.708 --> 18:37.500
if I didn't
let you take me out
for rice pudding.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.834
I just couldn't look
at one boring website
after another anymore.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.417
- Fluent in French Toast
with blessings?
- Yeah, that's me.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.708
- Yes!
- And I Gotta
the Panna Cotta.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.917
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.875
You're gonna
wake up one day
and realize

18:49.875 --> 18:52.792
you've wasted
your entire life
on dumb websites.

18:52.792 --> 18:55.834
You're too late.
That already happened.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.291
Your brain is rotting.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.875
You used to have
interesting ideas

18:58.875 --> 19:00.875
and now all you do
is browse the Internet.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.583
Maybe that's why
you stopped writing.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.917
That's not a very nice
thing to say.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.708
- Here you go.
- Oh, I'm sorry, we don't
take American Express.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.166
Okay, well,
that's all I have.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.375
Perfect.
I'm taking you out now.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.750
That is perfect.
Just perfect.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.333
Thank you so much.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.708
Thanks.

19:21.708 --> 19:25.375
♪ What if you and I
just put up ♪

19:25.375 --> 19:28.208
♪ A middle finger
to the sky? ♪

19:28.208 --> 19:30.417
Okay, what's going on
between us?

19:31.667 --> 19:34.208
Nothing's going on
between us, Hannah.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.208
What's going on
is that I was
trying to study

19:36.208 --> 19:38.333
and I couldn't
because you didn't
want me to.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.458
Because you're jealous
that I have a passion,

19:40.458 --> 19:44.250
so, of course,
here I am catering
to your needs yet again.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.708
Everyone has to drop
everything for Hannah

19:46.708 --> 19:49.125
when Hannah needs
"support."

19:49.125 --> 19:51.417
Why are you being
so mean to me?

19:52.917 --> 19:54.083
I'm always mean to you.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.250
Yeah, but usually
it's nicer.

19:56.250 --> 19:59.750
Wow, shorts really seem
to be getting shorter
these days.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.583
You're acting
so weird, okay?

20:01.583 --> 20:03.708
I know you.
Something's going on.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.250
I'm fine.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.917
Okay.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.000
Okay, then, maybe
we're just growing
in different directions.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.917
Maybe you don't want
to be friends anymore.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.959
Maybe.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.792
Jessa!

20:17.792 --> 20:21.041
What? I'm just
trying to be open.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.750
You know what?
I'm thinking maybe
I'm gonna take

20:23.750 --> 20:25.917
my Fluent in French Toast
on the train.

20:25.917 --> 20:27.667
If I'm gonna hang out
with someone who hates me,

20:27.667 --> 20:30.542
it might as well
be my boyfriend.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.625
( laughs )

20:38.708 --> 20:40.750
But, seriously,
you are the biggest bitch

20:40.750 --> 20:42.542
I've ever met
in my whole life.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.917
You are a total cunt.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.083
( sighs )

20:54.083 --> 20:56.333
( music playing )

20:58.750 --> 21:01.500
( chattering indistinctly )

21:28.667 --> 21:31.208
( laughing )

21:54.875 --> 21:57.041
Adam:
I'm not here!

21:59.750 --> 22:01.959
Hey!

22:01.959 --> 22:04.542
- Hi.
- What's up?
Come in.

22:04.542 --> 22:10.083
I just-- I just came
from seeing Hannah
and, um...

22:10.083 --> 22:12.542
What happened?
What's wrong?

22:12.542 --> 22:16.583
What's wrong is--
is this.

22:18.417 --> 22:19.750
Us.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.291
( chuckles )

22:22.708 --> 22:24.625
You're shaking.

22:26.583 --> 22:28.708
( sighs )

22:31.917 --> 22:33.417
I've--

22:33.417 --> 22:37.125
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

22:37.125 --> 22:39.125
Me, too.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.208
( moans )

22:52.208 --> 22:55.083
Is that--
yeah, it's fine.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.917
It's fine.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.750
Hold on, hold on,
wait a sec.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.792
I just need
to put my leg--

23:00.792 --> 23:03.166
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no,
I'm totally good.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.208
I'm just perfect.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.208
( laughs )
Don't do that.
