WEBVTT

00:06.934 --> 00:09.400
CYRANO DE BERGERAC
STANDS IN THE SHADOWS,

00:09.400 --> 00:11.600
WHISPERING POETRY
TO THE LOVELY ROXANNE.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.233
BUT SHE THINKS
IT'S THE GOOD-LOOKING GUY

00:13.233 --> 00:14.233
SPEAKING TO HER.

00:14.233 --> 00:16.600
OUR POOR, BIG-NOSED LUG
WINS THE HEART

00:16.600 --> 00:17.767
OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES

00:17.767 --> 00:20.400
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.600
THAT'S SO SWEET
AND NOBLE,

00:22.600 --> 00:25.567
THAT HE'D SACRIFICE
HIS OWN HAPPINESS
TO HELP HIS FRIEND.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.500
OTHER OPINIONS?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.100
LOSER.
LOSER.
LOSER.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.300
O.K. DEFINE "LOSER."

00:30.300 --> 00:31.300
BIG DIP.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.900
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
HE LIKES THIS GIRL,

00:33.900 --> 00:36.834
THEN PASSES HER ON
TO ANOTHER GUY.

00:36.834 --> 00:37.700
DIP.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.500
THE BIGGEST.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.467
CAN YOU REFUTE
THE DIP THEORY?

00:40.467 --> 00:42.500
CYRANO PERFORMS
A TOTALLY SELFLESS ACT,

00:42.500 --> 00:45.800
AND HE DOES IT
FOR THE SAKE OF LOVE.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.300
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.367
WHY?

00:48.367 --> 00:49.967
HE KNOCKS
HIMSELF OUT
SPEWING POETRY.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.200
HIS FRIEND
GETS THE GIRL.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.900
ALL HE
CAN DO IS BLOW
HIS BIG NOSE.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.934
REBUTTAL FROM
THE ESTROGEN SECTION.

00:56.934 --> 00:59.000
BOYS DON'T UNDERSTAND
PASSION AND ROMANCE

00:59.000 --> 01:00.934
AND WILL NEVER
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

01:00.934 --> 01:03.500
THAT'S WHY YOU'LL SPEND
HALF YOUR LIVES CONFUSED

01:03.500 --> 01:05.734
AND THE OTHER LIFE
PAYING ALIMONY.

01:05.734 --> 01:06.967
THIS IS INTERESTING.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.033
THE WOMEN HERE FIND CYRANO
COMPELLING AND ROMANTIC,

01:10.033 --> 01:13.000
AND YET THE MEN
FIND HIM MISGUIDED

01:13.000 --> 01:14.100
AND, UH...

01:14.100 --> 01:15.000
DIPLIKE.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.700
WHAT DOES THIS
TELL US?

01:16.700 --> 01:19.000
WOMEN LIKE DIPS?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.600
SORRY, MATTHEWS,
NO LUCK.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.934
IT TELLS US
THAT MEN

01:21.934 --> 01:24.000
HAVE A HARD TIME
UNDERSTANDING

01:24.000 --> 01:25.600
WHAT WOMEN
FIND ROMANTIC.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.967
WILL THAT BE
ON THE TEST?

01:27.967 --> 01:29.200
OH, YEAH.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
IN WAYS YOU
CANNOT YET IMAGINE.

01:34.734 --> 01:35.900
HERE.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.567
THANKS.
IF I'D HIDDEN IT
IN THE HOUSE,

01:37.567 --> 01:39.200
SHE WOULD'VE
FOUND IT.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.767
ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP YOU
STASH YOUR WHATEVER IT IS.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.233
TRASH COMPACTOR.

01:44.233 --> 01:47.000
A TRASH COMPACTOR?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.400
FOR YOUR ANNIVERSARY?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.900
HOW SURPRISING.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.233
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.133
THIS IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.100
THIS IS 2 TONS
OF PRESSURE.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.734
YOU PUT COAL IN THIS,
YOU GET DIAMONDS.

01:59.734 --> 02:02.800
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A BETTER WAY TO GO.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.200
OH, NOTHING.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.667
I'M CERTAIN
YOU GOT HER

02:06.667 --> 02:08.133
EXACTLY WHAT
SHE WANTED.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.900
SHE DOES
WANT THIS, HMM?

02:09.900 --> 02:12.867
SHE'S BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HAVING A COMPACTOR
FOR YEARS.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.734
WELL, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

02:14.734 --> 02:18.200
AND I HOPE
YOU HAVE OTHERS.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.567
AMY! MY BRIDE!

02:23.567 --> 02:26.400
DINNER RESERVATIONS
IN HALF AN HOUR!

02:26.400 --> 02:27.700
SO, DAD, WHAT'S UP?

02:27.700 --> 02:29.133
I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE.

02:29.133 --> 02:30.367
17 YEARS AGO TODAY,

02:30.367 --> 02:32.967
SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT HAPPENED.

02:32.967 --> 02:34.900
IT'S YOUR
ANNIVERSARY, RIGHT?

02:34.900 --> 02:36.367
CORRECT.

02:36.367 --> 02:39.567
DON'T LEAVE US
OUT IN THE COLD.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.800
I SUPPOSE
THERE'S ROOM FOR ALL

02:41.800 --> 02:43.200
ON MY LOVE BUS.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.900
AND YOUR NAME IS...

02:44.900 --> 02:45.700
OH...

02:45.700 --> 02:47.667
I'M READY FOR DINNER.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.567
THAT AND MORE.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.200
BUT ARE YOU READY...

02:51.200 --> 02:52.500
FOR THIS?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.567
OH, WHAT IS THAT?

02:54.567 --> 02:58.033
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
MY SWEET.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.834
YES!

03:02.834 --> 03:04.400
OHH...

03:04.400 --> 03:05.500
WOW.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.200
A TRASH COMPACTOR.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.133
YES!

03:08.133 --> 03:09.200
THANK YOU.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.767
WE WERE JUST
PUTTING OUR NAMES--

03:11.767 --> 03:12.800
CORY!

03:12.800 --> 03:15.200
"TO AMY WITH LOVE
FROM ALAN."

03:15.200 --> 03:16.133
JUST ALAN.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.400
NOBODY ELSE.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.200
SEE YA.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.300
WELL?

03:22.300 --> 03:23.834
DO YOU LIKE IT?

03:23.834 --> 03:26.233
YES, IT'S--
IT'S FINE.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.233
LET'S GO.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.100
AMY, CALL ME CRAZY,

03:29.100 --> 03:32.300
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SAID
YOU WANTED.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.467
YES, ALAN.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.400
AND A TRASH COMPACTOR
WOULD BE A LOVELY GIFT

03:35.400 --> 03:37.600
ON, SAY, A TUESDAY.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.100
YOU SAID YOU WANTED...

03:40.100 --> 03:41.500
COMPACTOR.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.867
I GET COMPACTOR.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.900
WHY OOG WRONG?

03:46.900 --> 03:49.967
WE DON'T WANT
TO BE LATE FOR DINNER.

03:51.667 --> 03:55.467
OOG NOT SLEEP
IN CAVE TONIGHT.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.567
HARLEY.
WHAT, NO KISS?

04:05.567 --> 04:08.734
I'M NOT FEELIN'
REAL KISSY, GLORIA.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.734
HOW COME LAST NIGHT
YOU KEEP ME WAITIN'

04:10.734 --> 04:12.600
FOR 20 MINUTES
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE?

04:12.600 --> 04:16.367
HOW COME YOU SIT THERE,
HONK YOUR HORN,
AND DON'T COME IN?

04:16.367 --> 04:19.300
'CAUSE MAYBE I SAW
YOUR FATHER BY THE DOOR

04:19.300 --> 04:21.467
AND DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY HELLO.

04:21.467 --> 04:23.734
THAT WAS MY MOTHER.

04:23.734 --> 04:26.600
THEN I DEFINITELY
DON'T WANT TO MEET
YOUR FATHER.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.800
ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS,
THEY HAVE GUYS

04:28.800 --> 04:30.734
WHO COME UP
TO THE DOOR.

04:30.734 --> 04:33.233
THAT'S 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE CARS.

04:33.233 --> 04:37.200
THEY GOT CARS,
AND THEY GOT MANNERS,
SO THERE.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.900
YOUR FINGER'S
IN MY FACE.
IS THAT MANNERS?

04:39.900 --> 04:42.500
HEY, LOVEBIRDS,
I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.600
WHERE HAS THIS
RELATIONSHIP'S MAGIC GONE?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.800
IF I MAY VENTURE
TO INTERJECT--

04:46.800 --> 04:47.867
OH, CORK IT,
JOEY.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.400
CONSIDER ME CORKED.
THE NEXT WORDS YOU HEAR

04:50.400 --> 04:53.100
WON'T BE MINE BECAUSE
I'M 100% ABSOLUTELY ZIPPED.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.867
PUT WHITE ON MY FACE.
I'M A MIME.

04:55.867 --> 04:56.900
CORK IT, JOEY.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.934
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, FRANKIE?

04:58.934 --> 05:01.200
YOU'VE NOT SAID
ANYTHING ALL DAY.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.767
I'M JUST HAVIN'
SOME QUIET TIME.

05:04.767 --> 05:05.800
THAT'S GOOD.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.000
SOME PEOPLE

05:07.000 --> 05:09.300
AROUND HERE
COULD LEARN FROM THAT.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.600
THE MACARONI
AND CHEESE

05:10.600 --> 05:12.867
HAD MORE GREASE
THAN HARLEY'S HAIR.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.200
THAT'S HOW
THEY MADE IT.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
THEY TURNED HIM OVER
AND WRUNG HIM OUT.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.800
OHH!
AAH!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.934
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS A SLOW DAY.

05:20.934 --> 05:23.600
YOU THOUGHT
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR HAIR?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.734
NO. NO. EVERYONE KNOWS
YOUR HAIR'S NOT GREASY.

05:26.734 --> 05:29.100
WHY DON'T YOU
TEST IT AND TELL ME?

05:30.734 --> 05:32.934
WOW. DRY AS A BONE.

05:32.934 --> 05:35.600
[SQUEAK]

05:35.600 --> 05:36.400
SORRY.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.967
INNER EAR PROBLEM.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.100
HERE'S A QUARTER,
BABOON.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.500
CALL YOUR PARENTS.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.700
SAY GOODBYE.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.900
IN MANY COUNTRIES,
WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOUR HAIR,

05:44.900 --> 05:47.400
IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED
A COMPLIMENT.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.800
FOR EXAMPLE--GREECE.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.867
THAT'S FUNNY.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.667
YEAH, YEAH. HE'S
A PRETTY FUNNY GUY.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.400
SO I GUESS I GET
TO LIVE, HUH?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.233
THERE'S THAT
HUMOR AGAIN.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.367
I<i>WILL </i>MISS THAT.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.500
AW, HARLEY,
ARE YOU SURE

06:02.500 --> 06:03.867
YOU GOTTA
BEAT HIM UP?

06:03.867 --> 06:05.967
YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO SOMETHING
UGLY TO US

06:05.967 --> 06:08.967
IN FRONT OF THIS
BEAUTIFUL ANGEL
OF THE HALLWAY.

06:11.033 --> 06:12.900
WHY WOULD YOU WASTE
YOUR TIME POUNDING US

06:12.900 --> 06:14.700
WHEN YOU COULD
BE SPENDING IT

06:14.700 --> 06:16.200
WITH CLAUDIA SCHIFFER'S
CUTER SISTER?

06:16.200 --> 06:19.400
OH, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I WOULD SAY
CUTER.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.734
TURN IT OFF.

06:20.734 --> 06:23.000
I'M TURNING IT
OFF, SIR.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.800
OH, COME ON, HARLEY.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.300
GO EASY ON HIM.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.033
DO IT FOR ME.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.367
VERY WELL, GLORIA.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.834
I WILL NOT LAY
A HAND ON HIM.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.300
FRANKIE. REMEMBER
THAT PIÃ‘ATA

06:33.300 --> 06:36.800
I PROMISED YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

06:36.800 --> 06:37.834
HERE'S TWO.

06:37.834 --> 06:40.300
<i>FELIZ NAVIDAD.</i>

06:40.300 --> 06:41.900
BYE-BYE.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.300
LOOK, I GOT
AN IDEA.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.500
HOW ABOUT YOU
GIVE US

06:46.500 --> 06:49.600
A FIVE MINUTE
HEAD START, THEN
HUNT US DOWN?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.567
THAT'D BE MORE
FUN FOR YOU.

06:51.567 --> 06:53.500
O.K. THE WAY
I SEE IT,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.400
YOU GUYS GOT
TWO OPTIONS.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.667
ONE--YOU DIE.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.767
I'LL TAKE NUMBER TWO.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.600
YEAH, NUMBER TWO'S
LOOKIN' GOOD TO ME.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.400
TWO IS YOU
DO ME A FAVOR.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.934
DONE.
HAPPY TO.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.000
NAME IT.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.734
I--

07:07.734 --> 07:09.367
FRANKIE STECCHINO--

07:09.367 --> 07:11.767
AM IN LOVE.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.133
WHERE'S THIS GOIN'?

07:18.133 --> 07:20.767
SHE IS A GODDESS,
STEPPED DOWN
FROM HEAVEN...

07:20.767 --> 07:23.200
THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.767
HER VOICE IS
LIKE THE TINKLING
OF BELLS,

07:26.767 --> 07:28.834
AND HER EYES...

07:28.834 --> 07:31.300
ALSO TINKLE
LIKE BELLS.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.467
THAT'S REAL SAD
AND TENDER AND--

07:33.467 --> 07:36.200
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM US?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.900
HELP ME WOO HER.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.367
WHAT?

07:39.367 --> 07:41.600
WOO HER.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.767
WHAT?

07:43.934 --> 07:44.900
I'VE WATCHED
YOU GUYS.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.200
YOU'RE A GOOD
LITTLE TALKER.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.400
AND YOU--GIRLS
SEEM TO HAVE
A THING FOR YOU.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.867
I WANT YOU GUYS
TO COACH ME.

07:51.867 --> 07:54.400
FRANKIE, I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE THE GUYS

07:54.400 --> 07:56.200
TO HELP YOU
WOO HER.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.300
WHAT?

07:57.300 --> 07:59.734
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HARLEY ABOUT THIS?

07:59.734 --> 08:01.567
HE'D PROBABLY BE
MORE HELPFUL.

08:01.567 --> 08:05.400
SO. YOU DO NOT
FEEL ABLE TO DO ME
THIS FAVOR?

08:05.400 --> 08:08.133
IT'S PROBABLY NOT
SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

08:08.133 --> 08:10.300
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.500
ALL RIGHT,
PIÃ‘ATA BOYS,

08:11.500 --> 08:15.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU
HAS THE PRIZE
INSIDE?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.400
I DON'T WANT TO DIE

08:16.400 --> 08:19.300
BEFORE I KNOW
WHAT "WOO" IS.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.467
AHEM.

08:27.467 --> 08:28.567
HI.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.000
HELLO.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.700
WELL, I HELPED MORGAN
STRAIGHTEN UP HER ROOM,

08:31.700 --> 08:34.500
AND I CLEANED OUT
THOSE GUTTERS.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.934
YOU KNOW, BOY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

08:35.934 --> 08:37.600
THEY REALLY NEEDED IT.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.100
WHOO. SO
HOW YOU DOING?

08:45.200 --> 08:48.900
OH. WOW. I THINK
I'LL JUST TAKE OUT
THIS GARBAGE.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.033
[CHUCKLES]

08:50.033 --> 08:51.967
YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST
GET THIS GARBAGE,

08:51.967 --> 08:54.300
AND I'LL, UM,
JUST...TAKE IT OUT.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.500
ALAN.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
GEORGE.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
THAT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY

09:02.500 --> 09:05.900
LIKE A FLUFFY,
NONCOMPACTED BAG
OF GARBAGE.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.467
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN AROUND

09:07.467 --> 09:11.600
TO INSTALLING
THE, UM...YOU KNOW,
THE TRASH COMPACTOR.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.467
WILL YOU BE?

09:13.467 --> 09:15.200
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.400
AH.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.834
I'M AWARE
IT'S AN APPLIANCE,

09:17.834 --> 09:20.400
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
IT WAS A TOASTER.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.200
IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE
APPLIANCE.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.834
AND I WOULD'VE NEVER
GOTTEN IT FOR HER,

09:24.834 --> 09:26.500
BUT THE OCCASION
WAS SPECIAL.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.000
IT COST MORE
THAN THE RING.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.800
NOT AN ARGUMENT
I WOULD RECOMMEND
USING.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
WELL...YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.000
PERFECTLY. SHE ASKED
FOR A TRASH COMPACTOR,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.600
AND YOU WENT OUT
AND GOT IT.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.900
KIND OF
A NO-BRAINER.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.100
NO-BRAINER?

09:43.100 --> 09:45.467
IT WAS A REAL TIME
SAVER, WASN'T IT?

09:45.467 --> 09:46.967
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO SIT AROUND

09:46.967 --> 09:49.400
WRACKING YOUR BRAINS
ABOUT WHAT
SHE WOULD LIKE...

09:49.400 --> 09:51.800
WHAT WOULD MAKE
<i>HER </i>FEEL GOOD...

09:51.800 --> 09:55.567
WHAT WERE THE THINGS
ABOUT HER
THAT YOU LOVE.

09:57.367 --> 10:00.834
WHOO, I MISSED
THAT EXIT COMPLETELY.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.467
THINK THERE'S TIME
TO BACK UP?

10:03.467 --> 10:06.600
ON THE HUSBAND HIGHWAY,
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
FORWARD TRAFFIC...

10:06.600 --> 10:09.300
JUST A MILLION
WELL-INTENTIONED MEN

10:09.300 --> 10:11.033
BACKING UP FRANTICALLY.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.800
[CHUCKLES]

10:12.800 --> 10:14.800
YOU'VE BEEN DOWN
THAT HIGHWAY BEFORE,
HUH, GEORGE?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.500
YES, I HAVE...

10:16.500 --> 10:18.867
BEFORE IT WAS PAVED.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.100
HEY, COR.
HI.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.133
SHAWN.

10:24.133 --> 10:25.867
AAH!

10:25.867 --> 10:27.367
ERIC, YOU KNOW
FRANKIE STECCHINO.

10:27.367 --> 10:28.734
FRANKIE, THIS
IS MY BROTHER ERIC.

10:28.734 --> 10:31.500
ERIC. I STOLE YOUR LUNCH
EVERY DAY IN NINTH GRADE.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.200
DON'T TELL ME...
TUNA ON WHITE.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.734
[CHUCKLES]
WHEAT.

10:35.734 --> 10:38.033
RIGHT, RIGHT. THOSE
WERE THE DAYS, HUH?

10:38.033 --> 10:42.000
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT'S THE ENFORCER
DOING IN OUR HOUSE?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.367
WE GOT IT
UNDER CONTROL.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.700
UNDER CONTROL?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.133
FRANKIE STECCHINO
SPRINKLES GUYS LIKE YOU
ON HIS PIZZA.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.400
ERIC. PLEASE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.800
O.K. JUST REMEMBER--
NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS,

10:52.800 --> 10:56.500
NO SHINY OBJECTS
IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.
O.K.?

10:56.500 --> 10:59.133
IT WAS NICE SEEING
YOU AGAIN, FRANKIE.

10:59.133 --> 11:02.100
NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, TUNA.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.867
O.K., GUYS, TEACH ME
THE WAYS OF LOVE.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.000
THIS GIRL YOU LIKE.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.734
DO YOU EVER TRY
TO TALK TO HER?

11:09.734 --> 11:10.600
OH...

11:10.600 --> 11:11.900
I--I, UH...

11:11.900 --> 11:13.000
I, UH...I...

11:13.000 --> 11:15.200
DON'T LET HER
PSYCH YOU.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.934
WALK RIGHT UP
AND TELL HER
YOU LIKE HER, O.K.?

11:17.934 --> 11:20.834
OHHH...

11:20.834 --> 11:22.200
O.K.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.300
LET'S PRETEND
THAT THIS IS HER.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.400
MMM...COULD
THE PILLOW BE HER?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.867
ANYTHING
YOU WANT,
BIG GUY.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.867
AH, THERE SHE IS.

11:32.867 --> 11:36.467
OOH. SHE LOOKS
VERY PRETTY TODAY.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.934
I'D BETTER GO.

11:37.934 --> 11:41.800
UH, COME ON. TELL HER
HOW NICE SHE LOOKS.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.500
[WHISPERING]
I CAN'T TAKE
MY EYES OFF YOU.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.567
[POORLY SPOKEN]
I CAN'T TAKE
MY EYES OFF YOU.

11:50.567 --> 11:53.500
[HIGH VOICE]
THANK YOU, FRANKIE.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.100
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

11:57.100 --> 11:58.734
HOW PRETTY
THAT DRESS IS.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.734
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

12:00.734 --> 12:02.734
HOW PRETTY
THAT DRESS IS.

12:02.734 --> 12:04.367
OH, THIS OLD THING?

12:04.367 --> 12:07.100
THERE YOU GO.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.800
NO, I COULD
NEVER DO THIS
BY MYSELF.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.000
YOU GUYS HAVE TO
COME WITH ME.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.967
I THINK SHE'S
GOING TO NOTICE

12:13.967 --> 12:15.467
TWO GUYS HANGING
AROUND YOU.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.100
YOU PLAN
TO PUT US
IN YOUR LOCKER?

12:18.100 --> 12:19.867
[FRANKIE]
STAY WITH ME HERE.

12:19.867 --> 12:22.200
THERE'S NO WAY
OUT OF HERE.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.600
I KNOW. I CHECKED.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.700
FRANKIE?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.700
YOU'RE TALKING
TO YOURSELF.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.667
NOT REALLY.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.367
SEE, I, UH...

12:30.367 --> 12:31.300
MMM...

12:31.300 --> 12:32.300
OHHH...

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
DOES SHE SOUND
FAMILIAR TO YOU?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.400
QUIET.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.567
THIS IS HARD
FOR ME TO SAY...

12:37.567 --> 12:40.100
THIS IS HARD
FOR ME TODAY.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.000
BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED YOU
FOR SO LONG...

12:45.000 --> 12:48.233
AND I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF TELLING YOU
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.367
BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED YOU.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.200
SO LONG.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.800
AND I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF...

12:55.800 --> 12:57.500
SOMETHING.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.734
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:58.734 --> 13:00.600
I LOVE YOU!
I LOVE YOU.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.100
YOU DO?

13:02.100 --> 13:04.834
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
I THINK ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.200
IF YOU WERE MY GIRL,

13:06.200 --> 13:09.233
I'D TREAT YOU LIKE
THE MAGIC PRINCESS
THAT YOU ARE.

13:09.233 --> 13:12.033
YOUR FRIEND
NEVER TALKS TO ME
LIKE THIS.

13:12.033 --> 13:13.300
PERHAPS HE IS NOT WRACKED

13:13.300 --> 13:16.033
WITH A LOVE
THAT CONSUMES
HIS ENTIRE BEING.

13:16.033 --> 13:19.233
DO YOU WANT TO GO
GET A BURGER?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.600
I WOULD LOVE TO.

13:22.934 --> 13:25.600
I JUST FIGURED OUT
WHO THAT GIRL IS.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.100
SHE LIKES HIM.
WE DID IT.

13:27.100 --> 13:31.600
WE JUST FIXED UP FRANKIE
WITH HARLEY KINER'S
GIRLFRIEND.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.233
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.467
AAH!

13:36.467 --> 13:37.934
HOO HOO!

13:44.400 --> 13:46.233
OH, BOY. OH, BOY.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.400
WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.100
NO. NOBODY SAW US.
NO WITNESSES.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.767
AND WITHOUT WITNESSES,
IT'S ALL JUST
CIRCUMCISED EVIDENCE.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.300
SHAWN, WE JUST
HELPED FRANKIE SNAKE
HARLEY'S GIRLFRIEND!

13:57.300 --> 14:00.400
WE GAVE HIM
LOVE LESSONS,
WE HID IN A LOCKER,

14:00.400 --> 14:03.233
WE TOLD HIM
WHAT TO SAY.
ISN'T THAT TROUBLE?

14:03.233 --> 14:04.700
LET ME THINK. UM...

14:04.700 --> 14:05.900
PROTECTIVE
CUSTODY...

14:05.900 --> 14:06.867
PLASTIC SURGERY...

14:06.867 --> 14:08.834
HA! WE DRESS UP
AS GIRLS,

14:08.834 --> 14:11.500
PRETEND WE'RE
OUR OUT-OF-TOWN
COUSINS,

14:11.500 --> 14:14.100
AND SAY WE HAVEN'T
SEEN OURSELVES.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.233
NO. THAT'LL NEVER WORK.

14:15.233 --> 14:18.200
OH, YEAH?
TELL MY UNCLE MARY.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.233
HARLEY!

14:20.233 --> 14:21.667
HOW ARE YA?

14:21.667 --> 14:24.300
DIDN'T I TELL FRANKIE
TO DISPOSE OF YOU GUYS?

14:24.300 --> 14:28.467
YES...AND HE DID.
HE KILLED US. BIG TIME.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.100
AND...NOW WE'RE THE...
ANGELS OF OURSELVES.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.667
AND IT'S TIME FOR US
TO FLOAT AWAY.

14:34.667 --> 14:35.667

SEEN HER.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.133

14:43.133 --> 14:46.100

THE WHOLE TIME.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.200
THE WHOLE TIME

14:48.200 --> 14:50.300
COME ON, SHAWN.

14:53.133 --> 14:54.834

IT'S O.K.

14:54.834 --> 14:57.200
YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOT TO SAY.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.300
STILL WATERS
RUN DEEP.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.667
I'M A OCEAN...

15:00.667 --> 15:04.233
A OCEAN OF
LOVE FOR YOU.

15:04.233 --> 15:08.000

ANYTHING SWEET LIKE THAT
TO ME BEFORE.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.600
AND MY MOST TRUSTED
FLUNKY.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.367
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
SOME TIME ALONE.

15:20.367 --> 15:23.000
MY WORLD IS SHATTERED.
I FEEL SO...

15:23.000 --> 15:24.400
VULNERABLE.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.133
I THINK I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO KILL
SOMEBODY.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.500
O.K., EVERYBODY
OUT OF HERE!

15:30.500 --> 15:31.934

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
IMAGINE MY SURPRISE.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.500
HARLEY,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.567
I LOOK FORWARD
TO HEARING IT.

15:44.567 --> 15:47.100
I WENT
BEHIND YOUR BACK
AND STOLE YOUR GIRL.

15:47.100 --> 15:51.667
I KNOW THIS IS
A BETRAYAL OF
OUR SACRED TRUST...

15:51.667 --> 15:54.000
BUT I HAVE
NO CHOICE.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.400
I AM BUT A PAWN
OF LOVE.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.934
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

15:59.934 --> 16:02.800
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW?
I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.200
ALL IT TOOK
WAS SOMEBODY

16:04.200 --> 16:06.000
SAYING SOMETHING
NICE TO ME
FOR A CHANGE,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
MAKING ME FEEL
SPECIAL.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.500
I MAKE YOU
FEEL SPECIAL.
I GET YOU STUFF.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.667
NAME SOMETHING THAT
MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL.

ABOUT WHAT I LIKE!

16:20.800 --> 16:22.133
I AIN'T GOT THE TIME.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.200
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
MADE SOME TIME.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.133
MAYBE IF YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT ME

16:26.133 --> 16:27.867
INSTEAD OF ALWAYS
THINKIN' ABOUT YOU!

16:27.867 --> 16:29.100

ABOUT YOU,

WHO'D THINK
ABOUT ME, HUH?

EVERY COUPLE
GOES THROUGH THIS.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.700
MY PARENTS
ARE GOING THROUGH
IT.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.200
YOUR PARENTS
DO THIS?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.567
WELL...

16:41.567 --> 16:43.500
NOT QUITE AS
LOUD, BUT YEAH.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.734
MY MOM'S
MAD AT MY DAD

16:45.734 --> 16:46.900
BECAUSE HE GOT HER

A TRASH COMPACTOR
FOR THEIR
ANNIVERSARY.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.033
WHAT A YUTZ.

16:51.033 --> 16:54.767
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S A LONG WAY
AWAY FROM TIRES.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.767
SO. YOUR PARENTS.
ARE THEY GONNA
SPLIT UP?

16:57.767 --> 17:02.200
NO. I MEAN,
THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.
THEY ALWAYS DO.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.567
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.600
YES, WELL,
YOUR SON, UM...

17:46.600 --> 17:47.900
CORY.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.200
CORY. HE INDICATED THAT
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

17:50.200 --> 17:52.600
WERE HAVING A SPAT
SIMILAR TO THE ONE

17:52.600 --> 17:54.300
I'M PRESENTLY HAVING
WITH MY OWN BETTER HALF.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.567
I WOULD GO
TO<i>MY </i>MOTHER
FOR ADVICE,

17:57.567 --> 18:00.667
BUT IT'S 4:00
IN THE AFTERNOON,
SO SHE'S OUT COLD.

18:00.667 --> 18:04.500
WELL...I DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN REALLY
HELP YOU.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.100
AW, PLEASE, MA'AM.
I GOT NOBODY ELSE
TO GO TO.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.767
NO!

18:15.834 --> 18:17.133
LEAVE MY MOM
ALONE, KINER!

18:17.133 --> 18:19.800
ERIC, WHAT
IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.000
DO YOU KNOW WHO
THIS IS, MOM?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
YES, I DO, AND
EVERYTHING IS
UNDER CONTROL.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.967
MORE TEA,
HARLEY?

18:26.967 --> 18:29.200
JUST A SMIDGE.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.800
HEY THERE, ERIC.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.200
HARLEY KINER'S
DRINKING TEA
IN MY KITCHEN.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.900
â™ª WHAT'S GOIN' ON? â™ª

18:34.900 --> 18:37.100
IT'S PERSONAL.
I DON'T THINK

18:37.100 --> 18:39.133
HARLEY WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT IT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.500
OH, HE'S GETTING
IN TOUCH WITH
HIS INNER THUG?

18:41.500 --> 18:43.300
ERIC, GO!

18:45.200 --> 18:48.300
MRS. MATTHEWS,
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
A FEW YEARS.

18:48.300 --> 18:52.033
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
SOME INSIGHT.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.000
WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.200
OH, IT'S PRETTY
SIMPLE, HARLEY.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.700
ALL WOMEN REALLY WANT
IS TO BE APPRECIATED.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.400
YOU THINK THAT
MAYBE GLORIA FEELS
A LITTLE UNAPPRECIATED?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.100
WHO KNOWS
WHAT SHE THINKS?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.934
WELL, YOU SHOULD.
YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND.

19:05.934 --> 19:07.600
AW, JEEZ, MRS. MATTHEWS,

19:07.600 --> 19:09.767
I'M NOT SO GOOD
WITH FEELINGS
AND EMOTIONS

19:09.767 --> 19:11.300
AND ALL THAT
RICKI LAKE STUFF.

19:11.300 --> 19:15.000
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
ARE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT,
HARLEY.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.934
I'LL BET YOU
GLORIA THINKS
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

19:18.934 --> 19:20.367
WELL...

19:20.367 --> 19:22.000
WHO COULD BLAME HER?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.200
THEN YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT HER...

19:24.200 --> 19:25.767
HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT HER,

19:25.767 --> 19:27.667
HOW MUCH YOU
APPRECIATE HER...

19:27.667 --> 19:30.200
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.467
WHY DOES SHE NEED
TO BE APPRECIATED
ALL THE TIME?

19:32.467 --> 19:34.400
THAT'S HOW YOU SHOW PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT THEM...

19:34.400 --> 19:36.767
BY THINKING ABOUT
WHAT<i>THEY </i>WANT...

19:36.767 --> 19:38.934
WHAT WOULD MAKE
<i>THEM </i>HAPPY.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.500
BY THE WAY,
WHO ARE YOU?

19:41.500 --> 19:44.233
JUST A FELLA WHO
TOOK A WRONG TURN

19:44.233 --> 19:45.834
ON THE HIGHWAY
OF LOVE.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.400
BEEN THERE.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.834
ARE YOU GOING
TO TALK TO GLORIA
AGAIN?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.700
NO. YOU WERE CORRECT
WHEN YOU SAID

19:51.700 --> 19:54.400
TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT<i>SHE </i>WANTS.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.500
WHAT SHE WANTS NOW
IS FRANKIE.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.934
THIS IS HOW
IT IS TO BE.

19:58.934 --> 20:00.934
I SHALL HAVE TO
WAIT MY TURN

20:00.934 --> 20:04.734
AND ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR LOVE.
THANKS, MRS. M.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.000
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.100
I KNOW, BUT
WHO ARE YOU?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.100
HARLEY KINER!

20:09.100 --> 20:10.934
OH, THANK YOU.

20:10.934 --> 20:13.100
TAKE ME. JUST
DON'T KILL THEM.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.500
IT'S O.K., BABOON.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.900
DEATH...
TAKES A HOLIDAY.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.033
WELL, NICE MEETING
YOU, HARLEY.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.000
OH, UH, UH,
THE, UM...

20:20.000 --> 20:21.133
TEACUP.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.867
GOOD EYES.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.667
WHAT WAS HE DOING HERE?

20:26.667 --> 20:28.100
OH, HE HAD
A GIRLFRIEND PROBLEM.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.000
HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE
HER ENOUGH.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.734
SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS
TO YOU YOUNG GUYS,

20:32.734 --> 20:34.300
BUT NOT US
SEASONED VETERANS.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.934
WE KNOW NEVER
TO TAKE THE PEOPLE

20:36.934 --> 20:38.767
WE CARE ABOUT
FOR GRANTED.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.667
WE LIKE TO SHOW THEM

20:40.667 --> 20:42.300
THAT EVERY DAY
TOGETHER IS A GIFT.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.967
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
DARLING. 18 PEARLS--

20:44.967 --> 20:47.133
ONE FOR EVERY YEAR
WE'RE MARRIED.

20:47.133 --> 20:49.300
THAT IS SO SWEET.

20:49.300 --> 20:53.000
BUT WE'VE
ONLY BEEN MARRIED
17 YEARS.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.767
ONE FOR THE YEAR
WE WEREN'T MARRIED.

20:54.767 --> 20:57.467
YEAH, THAT
WAS A GOOD YEAR.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.667
MMM.

20:58.667 --> 21:02.200
WAIT. WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.000
GUYS, WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.400
AW, GET A ROOM.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.934
HEY, MATTHEWS.
I WAS JUST GRADING
THE CYRANO PAPERS,

21:19.934 --> 21:21.800
AND I LIKED YOUR WORK.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.934
WELL, THAT'S
NOT SURPRISING,
SINCE I AM CYRANO.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.467
UH-HUH.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

21:26.467 --> 21:30.500
SEE THEM?
LIKE CYRANO,
I PUT THEM TOGETHER.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.667
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH HER,

21:32.667 --> 21:34.300
BUT YOU STEPPED ASIDE
FOR THE OTHER GUY?

21:34.300 --> 21:36.000
NO. I HID
IN A LOCKER

21:36.000 --> 21:37.667
AND HELPED FRANKIE
WOO HER.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.000
WHAT?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.834
WOO HER.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.300
OH. WELL...JOB
WELL DONE, MATTHEWS.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.500
SO YOU THINK
MAYBE THERE'S
SOME EXTRA CREDIT

21:46.500 --> 21:48.667
IN THIS FOR ME?

21:48.667 --> 21:51.667
NO. BUT TELL ME
WHAT YOU LEARNED.

21:51.667 --> 21:55.300
LOVE IS SOMETHING
YOU CAN NEVER
TAKE FOR GRANTED.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.700
SO IF YOU FIND SOMEONE

21:56.700 --> 21:59.200
YOU REALLY,
REALLY CARE ABOUT,

21:59.200 --> 22:02.667
NEVER BUY HER TIRES
OR MAJOR APPLIANCES.

22:02.667 --> 22:05.667
A VERY MATURE
UNDERSTANDING

22:05.667 --> 22:06.834
IN THE MYSTERY
OF LOVE.

22:06.834 --> 22:09.367
YOU ARE WISE
BEYOND YOUR YEARS.

22:09.367 --> 22:13.000
YOU GOTTA COME QUICK.
THE GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL
TEAM IS RUNNING LAPS.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.600
OH, BABY!
