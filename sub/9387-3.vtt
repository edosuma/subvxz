WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.922
It seems today that all you see

00:05.005 --> 00:08.300
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.383 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.681
On which we used to rely?

00:15.098 --> 00:18.352
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.435 --> 00:21.480
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:23.232
All the things that make us

00:23.315 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry

00:25.108 --> 00:29.947
He's a family guy

00:37.037 --> 00:40.415
Oh, yes! I slam it, and you can suck it!

00:40.499 --> 00:42.751
Joe, that was our last ball.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.837
Don't worry. Mr. Moose will help us out.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.464
-Won't you, Mr. Moose?
-Fine.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.842
-Knock-knock.
-Ping pong balls!

00:52.803 --> 00:55.097
Hey, guys, look at me.
I'm covered in balls.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.431
-Just like...
-Just like Sharon Stone.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.683
You beat me to it.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.894
Man, I haven't had this much fun
since I was in that Broadway show.

01:04.815 --> 01:10.320
I'm a Wolverine
And my hatred keeps me warm

01:10.404 --> 01:16.118
A wolverine
So you Russians best be warned

01:16.201 --> 01:17.619
Shooting commies
Drinking deer blood

01:17.703 --> 01:19.788
Peeing in the radiator
Look up there

01:19.872 --> 01:22.291
Here comes a really
Angry Russian helicopter

01:22.374 --> 01:23.917
(EXCLAIMING)

01:26.712 --> 01:30.340
It has been a red dawn.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.927
Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you
to pick up Meg at the roller rink.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.596
-No!
-We're just getting started!

01:35.679 --> 01:38.432
Meg is my least favorite
of all your children.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.976
It's all right. We'll just move the party
to the skating rink.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.769
Who's sober enough to drive?

01:43.729 --> 01:46.315
Okay, who's drunk,
but that special kind of drunk

01:46.398 --> 01:48.609
where you're a better driver
because you know you're drunk?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.777
You know, the kind of drunk
where you probably shouldn't drive,

01:50.861 --> 01:52.154
but you do anyway because,

01:52.237 --> 01:54.531
I mean, come on,
you gotta get your car home, right?

01:54.615 --> 01:57.159
I mean, what do they expect me to do,
take a bus?

01:57.242 --> 01:59.786
Is that what they want,
for me to take a bus?

01:59.870 --> 02:03.040
Well, screw that. You take a bus.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.542
-I'm that kind of drunk.
-Shotgun.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.343
Dad, where have you been?
I've been waiting for over an hour.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.095
Grab some wood there, bub.
Daddy and his friends have been drinking,

02:17.179 --> 02:20.182
and we're gonna keep on drinking
until we each uncover repressed memories

02:20.265 --> 02:23.060
of sexual abuse
by a trusted religious official.

02:23.143 --> 02:28.398
Oh, that's crazy talk. Oh, my God!
Minister Washington, how could you?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.275
Man, look at all these chicks.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.527
(EXCLAIMING)

02:32.277 --> 02:33.278
If I were a woman,

02:33.362 --> 02:36.490
I would press my bare boobs
up against glass in public

02:36.573 --> 02:41.453
just for the sexual thrill!
The sexual thrill!

02:41.537 --> 02:42.871
(EXCLAIMING)

02:42.955 --> 02:46.166
-How do I stop?
-Use the rubber stoppers on the front.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.546
Hey, baby, how'd you like
to share a pair of skates?

02:50.629 --> 02:52.798
-Sure!
-Never mind!

02:52.881 --> 02:56.134
-Boy, you look a lot better from the back.
-You jerk!

02:56.218 --> 02:58.387
Oh, hey, baby,
you want to go somewhere?

02:58.470 --> 03:02.015
No, no, no! Wait. Wait. Quagmire,
remember what's on the other side.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.643
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

03:33.505 --> 03:34.506
That was awesome!

03:34.590 --> 03:37.009
Oh, my God!
That was completely by accident.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.093
That was great fun.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.429
I don't even remember why we came,
but I had a ball.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.556
I look forward to reminiscing
about this tomorrow.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.685
Dad! Wait! You forgot me again!

03:47.394 --> 03:49.479
You need a lift?
Didn't answer me quick enough.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.941
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:58.447 --> 04:01.200
Remember those sweet,
warm New England summers?

04:01.450 --> 04:04.536
Remember sipping lemonade
underneath a shady tree?

04:04.620 --> 04:07.748
Remember when you hit that pedestrian
with your car at the crosswalk

04:07.831 --> 04:09.541
and then just drove away?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.460
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.086
But Pepperidge Farm
ain't just gonna keep it

04:13.170 --> 04:15.339
to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.425
Maybe you go out and buy yourself
some of these distinctive Milano cookies.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.511
Maybe this whole thing just disappears.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.679
Meg, what happened?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.724
Fat-ass and his drunk friends left me
at the roller rink.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.435
You know, this wouldn't have happened
if I had my own car.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.480
Meg, people have always found ways
to get around without a car.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.648
Look at Iceman.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.984
Honey, where'd you go
when you went out last night?

04:36.318 --> 04:37.611
Just over to Tom's house.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.738
Played some poker, had some brewskis.
You know.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.616
Really?
Then would you mind explaining that?

04:46.912 --> 04:51.041
At least they know how to touch a man.
Oh, walk away.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.545
You know, Peter, maybe Meg
having her own car isn't such a bad idea.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.964
-Yeah, I guess so.
-What?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.508
I have been trying
to get a sewing machine for months,

04:59.591 --> 05:02.094
but she gets a freaking car
just like that!

05:02.177 --> 05:03.512
I hate this place.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.516
Look at all these Hummers.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.601
What kind of jerk
would drive one of those?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.688
Dude, this car kicks ass,

05:12.771 --> 05:15.774
and I can watch Madagascar
while I'm driving!

05:16.191 --> 05:21.029
-What kind of music do you like, Gloria?
-Hippo-hop. Woohoo! Yeah, baby!

05:22.114 --> 05:24.575
Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.785
they make me want to merge
without looking!

05:29.121 --> 05:31.039
Yeah! Rumsfeld!

05:31.123 --> 05:32.708
Hi, there, can I help you folks?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.794
Yeah, my daughter's looking for a car
that goes with her personality.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.714
Yes, are the new bulimic-cutting mobiles
in yet?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.632
This is a 1996 sedan.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.844
Excellent gas mileage, air bags
and AM-FM cassette.

05:43.927 --> 05:48.015
-I love it! Dad, this is the car.
-Hang on a second, Meg.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.349
What can you tell me about this one?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.852
Oh, that's just an old tank I use
for those commercials

05:51.935 --> 05:54.062
where I declare war on high prices.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.689
Now, about that sedan...

05:56.190 --> 05:58.650
Hang on there, slick. Now I see your game.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.569
We come in here wanting a practical car,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.404
but then you dangle this tank
in front of me

06:02.487 --> 06:03.822
and expect me to walk away.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.034
Now, I may be an idiot,
but there is one thing I am not, sir,

06:07.117 --> 06:08.952
and that, sir, is an idiot.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.496
Now, I demand
you tell me more about this tank.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.710
Well, if you're looking for quality,
then look no further.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.588
That's more like it. Tell me,
what are the tank's safety features?

06:19.671 --> 06:21.173
What a good-looking question.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.967
Three inches of reinforced steel
protects your daughter

06:24.051 --> 06:25.427
from short-range missile attacks.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.930
I see, and does the sedan protect
against missiles?

06:28.013 --> 06:30.015
-It does not.
-You hear that, Meg?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.892
Yeah, it does not protect
against missiles.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.645
See, these are the questions.
This is why I'm here.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.940
Peter, you can't be serious.
This is a 30-ton war machine.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.942
I'm still not sure.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.152
-Did I mention the tank is a tank?
-Sold.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.199
PETER: Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.952
-Bocce balls!
-I bought a tank.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.370
Are you out of your mind?

06:51.453 --> 06:52.788
Let me show you how the gun works.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.081
(SCREAMING)

06:54.331 --> 06:55.666
(LAUGHING)

06:58.460 --> 07:00.003
What the hell?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.924
No, no, no, no!

07:04.132 --> 07:07.094
Hey, Peter, can you blow
that towel rack down here?

07:08.428 --> 07:09.721
Thank you.

07:11.473 --> 07:17.104
MAN: Jeff Daniels and Bill Pullman
star in Neil Simon's The Even Couple.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.649
-I ordered a pizza. I hope that's okay.
-Sure, I love pizza.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.693
This half of the apartment is mine,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.945
but if you want to come over here,
that's okay, too.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.613
This isn't spaghetti. It's linguini.

07:26.697 --> 07:29.408
You're right. It is.
I always get those confused.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.660
-Hey, all of us are human.
-I'm glad we're friends.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
Yeah, this is really working out.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.622
There's no conflict in this movie!

07:36.665 --> 07:38.542
When are you gonna get rid of that stump?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.044
I've been asking you for months
to get rid of that stump!

07:41.128 --> 07:43.130
I'll do it, all right?
Just get off my back!

07:46.925 --> 07:49.595
She's gone. We can finally be together.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.597
But, Tim, I'm rooted the ground.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.516
We'll find a way. We'll find a way.

07:57.853 --> 08:01.648
My God, it's hot. Brian, did you
turn off the air conditioner?

08:01.732 --> 08:04.651
Just open a window. Air conditioners
are harmful to the ozone layer.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.988
Brian, please, save your hippie BS
for the winter months, okay?

08:08.655 --> 08:11.617
Morning, civilians.
General Griffin reporting for breakfast.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.202
Dad, it's not fair.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.663
My money paid for that tank,
and I haven't even got to drive it yet.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.124
Jeez, Meg,
you always gotta ruin my good time,

08:19.208 --> 08:20.375
just like basic cable.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.252
MAN ON TV: We now return to Showgirls...

08:22.336 --> 08:23.378
Yeah!

08:23.462 --> 08:24.630
...on TBS.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.594
All right, Meg, you got a feel for
the controls. Now give it a little gas.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.351
Oh, great, it's here.
That mirror I bought on eBay.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.353
Oh, my God!

08:40.103 --> 08:41.563
(SCREAMING)

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
Joe, my God, what happened?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.736
You just ran over me, you bastard!

08:47.819 --> 08:51.073
I don't know where you got that thing,
but I'm impounding it!

08:51.990 --> 08:54.660
(SNICKERING) Look at you.
You look like a half-empty toothpaste.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.832
MAN ON TV: We now return
to the Ghost Whisperer.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.877
I don't understand.
Why do all you ghosts come to me?

09:03.961 --> 09:06.171
You're really...
I mean, you have a knack for...

09:06.255 --> 09:07.798
We just trust you.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.925
I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson

09:10.008 --> 09:12.511
confiscate the closest thing
I had to a car.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.013
Relax, Meg.
It's not the worst thing I've ever done.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.558
You remember that favor I did
for that park ranger?

09:17.641 --> 09:20.602
Hey, Boo Boo, let's see
what we got in this pic-a-nic basket.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.188
(GROANING)

09:23.272 --> 09:24.481
(SHUSHING)

09:27.609 --> 09:29.862
Tell the other bears what you just saw.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.196
Well, I don't care

09:31.280 --> 09:34.533
'cause you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.787
You know, I read that they're opening
a Superstore USA across town.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.205
Maybe you could get a job there.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.332
No. No, no way.
You cannot work there, Meg.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.836
Giant megastores like Superstore USA
are ruining this country.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.588
They don't pay their employees
a decent wage

09:47.671 --> 09:48.839
or give them health benefits.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.383
-Yeah, all gay guys hate Superstore USA.
-What?

09:55.053 --> 09:57.681
Welcome to the Superstore family, Meg.
Glad to have you.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.933
Thanks. I'm really excited to get to work.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.977
Now, let me just go over a few basics.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.813
You'll earn minimum wage,
no overtime, no health benefits,

10:04.897 --> 10:08.692
and every day at 3:00,
you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.611
Oh, it's nearly 3:00 now.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.242
-Here you go.
-You're beautiful.

10:17.326 --> 10:22.372
I would go out with you if I wasn't
already in a committed relationship.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.050
Hey, guys, what's going on?

10:33.133 --> 10:37.012
Oh, Peter, Superstore USA
has taken all my business.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.682
Mine, too. In fact, the only guy in town
making any money

10:40.766 --> 10:43.101
is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.

10:43.185 --> 10:47.940
Y'all laughed at me. Y'all laughed at me.
Well, who's laughing now?

10:48.023 --> 10:49.483
(LAUGHING)

10:50.150 --> 10:51.276
What do you think of this?

10:51.360 --> 10:54.321
-That makes you attractive.
-Yeah!

10:55.781 --> 10:58.575
Well, maybe now you guys are seeing
what I've been trying to explain to you.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.036
That megastore is a big, evil corporation

11:01.119 --> 11:02.913
that means nothing but trouble
for this town.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.165
Oh, man, this is the worst thing
to happen to this town

11:05.249 --> 11:07.835
since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.466
Looks like someone's a little lost.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.762
Everyone, I have some bad news.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.431
Superstore USA
has their own brewery on site

11:21.515 --> 11:23.767
and can sell beer at a much cheaper price,

11:23.851 --> 11:26.186
so management has decided
to close down.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.106
-You mean I'm out of a job again?
-I'm sorry, Peter.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.651
Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday
at Richard Gere's house.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.653
Okay, find the Easter egg.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.198
-I know where it is. It's in your butt.
-No.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.826
Yeah, I know the story. It's in your butt.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.662
Mr. Griffin, if you'd just
look on the ground for five seconds,

11:43.745 --> 11:44.746
I'm sure you'd find it.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.291
-Nope, in your butt.
-Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.417
-In your butt.
-Mr. Griffin...

11:48.500 --> 11:49.501
-Butt. Butt.
-Mr. Griffin...

11:49.585 --> 11:51.461
You know what?
Just get the hell out of here.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.213
Fine. Weirdo.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.096
So how was work today, Meg?

12:01.180 --> 12:03.974
Peter, you lost your job
because of the Superstore.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.601
You shouldn't blame Meg.

12:05.684 --> 12:09.104
And you can stop making that fart sound
every time someone says, "Meg."

12:09.438 --> 12:12.399
So how was your day
exploiting the town's resources, Meg?

12:13.984 --> 12:14.985
Meg.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.778
Meg.

12:16.862 --> 12:17.946
(RAZZING)

12:18.030 --> 12:20.574
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg!

12:22.826 --> 12:23.827
Meg.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.080
I'm not gonna sit here and take this.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.625
I'm the only one in this family
who has a job.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.752
Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.421
-What did he just say to you?
-Nothing, there was...

12:34.755 --> 12:37.966
Well, it's like if you were...
Forget it. It's nothing, Meg.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.722
-Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.
-And I'm Diane Simmons.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.806
At the top of the news,

12:44.890 --> 12:47.351
Quahog is suffering its worst heat wave
in a century.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.728
That's right, Diane.
We now go live to Ollie Williams

12:49.811 --> 12:52.272
with the black-you weather report.
How are you beating the heat, Ollie?

12:52.356 --> 12:53.941
-Swimming hole!
-Thanks, Ollie.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.902
In other news, Quahog
will be experiencing rolling blackouts

12:56.985 --> 13:00.113
to help meet Superstore USA's
extensive power demands.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.574
Oh, in fact,
Channel Five has just received

13:02.658 --> 13:04.743
this message from the Electric Company.

13:04.826 --> 13:08.080
Hey, you guys!

13:09.915 --> 13:12.835
We're gonna turn it on

13:12.918 --> 13:16.088
We're gonna bring you the power

13:16.171 --> 13:19.508
It's coming down the line
Strong as it can be

13:19.591 --> 13:25.430
Through the courtesy
Of the Electric Company

13:30.310 --> 13:31.645
Contrary to those upbeat lyrics,

13:31.728 --> 13:33.438
the Electric Company
would like us to emphasize

13:33.522 --> 13:35.148
it will not be bringing you the power.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.985
Great, rolling blackouts.

13:38.068 --> 13:41.113
Now, Superstore USA
is siphoning off all the city's power.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.740
-And they cost me my job.
-Mine, too.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.785
Superstore USA
has their own paper route.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.001
That new paperboy done gone
and broke my sternum.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.545
(BOTH MOANING)

14:02.801 --> 14:04.219
(SNORING)

14:08.473 --> 14:11.476
This sucks. That damn Superstore
is ruining everything.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.145
You know,
instead of sitting around complaining,

14:13.228 --> 14:14.980
why don't we go down there and protest?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.523
That's a great idea, Brian.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.651
All we need is some magic markers,
poster boards, some plywood...

14:19.735 --> 14:22.654
Actually, Superstore USA has
all that stuff. We can just get it there.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.661
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

14:33.165 --> 14:34.458
There's one of them now.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.294
Take that for stealing jobs
from hardworking people!

14:37.377 --> 14:39.004
(SCREAMING)

14:39.087 --> 14:41.048
Dad, what the hell are you doing?

14:41.131 --> 14:45.302
We got a message for you.
"We're here. We're queer. Get used to it."

14:45.385 --> 14:48.055
-Actually, Peter...
-Gattaca! Gattaca!

14:48.138 --> 14:50.849
Peter, I don't think it's working.
People are still going into the store.

14:53.018 --> 14:56.730
Well, fine, then I guess I gotta go
in there and drag them out one by one.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.318
All right, who the hell is in charge...

15:02.361 --> 15:04.613
What is that I'm feeling?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.865
That's our
industrial-sized air conditioner.

15:07.616 --> 15:11.119
When I walk into Superstore USA,
I get the sensation

15:11.203 --> 15:15.791
that I'm standing on a mountain top
with the wind blowing through my hair!

15:15.874 --> 15:19.378
My God,
look at this wonderland of treasures.

15:19.461 --> 15:23.090
What would a guy like me have to do
to be part of this magical world?

15:23.382 --> 15:26.927
You are trespassing on private property,
and I must ask you to leave.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.971
What? Are you out of your mind?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.766
-Leave this lot, losers.
-Unless you want a licking.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.935
And we'd love to deliver that licking,

15:35.018 --> 15:36.019
-right, fellows?
-Yeah.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
-Love it.
-A lot.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.774
I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop
in Lillehammer.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.657
God, I wish the power
would come back on.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.159
Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward
to this job.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.745
Peter, I can't believe
you're working for Superstore USA.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.414
How could you sell out like that?

15:55.497 --> 15:58.417
Because, Brian, they have
an industrial-sized air conditioner,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.919
Look, Dad, this isn't gonna be
a cake walk, all right?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.212
I'm your supervisor.

16:02.296 --> 16:05.841
Meg. Meg, I promise, I'll do better
at this job than I did on the SATs.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.310
Come on, do math.

16:18.854 --> 16:22.149
Dad, I need you to...
Dad, what are you doing?

16:22.316 --> 16:25.819
Meg. Meg, look. Meg, look.
I am so freaking good at coloring.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.905
I know I'm not supposed
to go outside the lines,

16:27.988 --> 16:30.282
but I do anyway
because I like being myself.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.744
Dad?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.495
(PETER WHINING)

16:36.663 --> 16:37.748
Dad?

16:39.958 --> 16:41.001
Dad?

16:41.210 --> 16:42.794
(PETER WHINING)

16:48.175 --> 16:50.511
Oh, God, it's so hot.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.180
Brian, spit on me.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.934
Oh, that's nice. Now tell me I'm scum.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.310
How will that cool you off?

16:59.186 --> 17:01.021
God, it's awful in here.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.024
This is even worse than getting herpes
from a toilet seat.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.193
Joanie, it's me.

17:06.276 --> 17:10.280
Oh, hey! You know, I had
such a great time with you last night.

17:10.364 --> 17:12.699
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you.

17:12.783 --> 17:15.869
I just got back from the doctor.
I have herpes.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.579
I think you should
get yourself checked out.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.705
Oh, my God.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.582
-Will you stay?
-What?

17:20.666 --> 17:23.627
Will you stay with me
even knowing that I have herpes?

17:24.586 --> 17:26.380
Yes, I will.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.215
-Joanie?
-Yeah?

17:28.423 --> 17:31.885
I don't have herpes.
I just needed to know that you'd stay.

17:32.678 --> 17:34.513
(SONG PLAYING)

17:38.559 --> 17:41.645
I've had it. The only place in town
that's got power is Superstore USA

17:41.728 --> 17:43.981
while the rest of us
are left to bake in the heat.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.483
There's gotta be something we can do
to take that place down.

17:46.567 --> 17:49.695
Don't worry, Brian.
I think I've got an idea.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.407
BOTH: Uh-huh.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.075
Oh, yeah!

17:58.745 --> 18:00.664
Meg, you're doing a great job.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.709
In fact, I'm promoting you
to assistant manager.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.045
Really? Oh, my God! Thank you so much.

18:07.129 --> 18:11.300
Now, your first responsibility
is to fire that employee.

18:11.383 --> 18:14.261
Boy, I'm a little chilly.
I hope no one notices.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.557
But that's my dad.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.351
What's more important to you,
your job or your family?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.936
And don't pick the obvious one.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.606
Oh, hey, guys. I was just catching up
on some plunger nipples.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.857
Dad...

18:27.482 --> 18:29.985
Go on, Meg. What are you waiting for?

18:35.324 --> 18:37.409
Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,

18:37.492 --> 18:39.661
but you're a fat-ass

18:39.745 --> 18:43.207
who's completely incapable
of performing the simplest tasks,

18:43.874 --> 18:46.668
but you're also my father,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.505
and you're the only one I'll ever have,

18:49.922 --> 18:52.674
so I'm not going to fire you.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.260
Mr. Penisberg, I quit.

18:55.344 --> 18:59.389
-Penisberg?
-Yeah, get it all out of your system.

18:59.473 --> 19:02.518
Meg, that was a wonderful thing
you just did for me.

19:03.060 --> 19:06.772
I can't believe this is coming out
of my mouth, but I love...

19:12.945 --> 19:15.113
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

19:41.056 --> 19:43.600
So you got a tank, big whoop.
Want to fight about it?

20:04.454 --> 20:06.999
Well, I'm glad
that Superstore USA is gone.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.834
That place was nothing but trouble.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.294
And I think we learned something.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.881
Any problem caused by a tank
can be solved by a tank.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.592
Dad, you were about to say something
in the store.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.386
-No, I don't think so.
-No, I'm sure of it.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.097
I don't know. Something about
Hardcastle and McCormick?

20:22.181 --> 20:24.850
No, you were going to say you love me.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.477
You love me, and you know it.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.688
Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.149
Well, you think
you'll look for another job, Meg?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.317
(RAZZING)

20:33.525 --> 20:34.860
Meg!

20:34.943 --> 20:35.986
Meg!

20:36.069 --> 20:37.070
Meg!

20:37.154 --> 20:38.780
(FARTING)

20:40.073 --> 20:41.408
Pardon me.
