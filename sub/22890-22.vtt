00:03.066 --> 00:03.533
- Tonight, on the three-part

00:03.533 --> 00:04.166
- Tonight, on the three-part
"Vanderpump Rules" Reunion.

00:06.166 --> 00:07.767
- Hi.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.567
- I'm ready.

00:10.567 --> 00:12.100
Are you ready?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.367
- Thank you for coming.

00:13.367 --> 00:16.100
I could not be here
without you.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.133
- It's palpable,
the anxiety in the air.

00:20.133 --> 00:21.700
- I hope there's no casualties.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.000
- He's always been
the boy who cried wolf.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.133
Everyone can attest to that.
- Oh, my God.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.433
- Hopefully James isn't drunk.
- Hopefully maybe he is.

00:28.433 --> 00:30.133
- Oh my God.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.567
do you want me to go from here?

00:31.567 --> 00:33.000
Nowhere, there's nowhere to go.
- Stop doing it.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.367
It's really simple.
- Fine.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.033
- Expect the worst.
Hope for the best.

00:36.033 --> 00:37.700
- I already had to deal
with being cheated on

00:37.700 --> 00:39.266
in front of the whole world.

00:39.266 --> 00:40.467
- And I--I ----ed up.

00:43.066 --> 00:44.734
She was amazing.

00:44.734 --> 00:46.600
.
We have, like, five minutes.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.734
- Well, look at them
when I go like this.

00:48.734 --> 00:51.467
- Sur's newest hostess,
Billie Lee will join us.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.600
When Billie Lee told you
she was going out with Jeremy

00:54.600 --> 00:56.266
You called him creepy--

00:56.266 --> 00:58.533
- I had no idea
that it hurt your feelings.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.033
- I'm about to go
on a date with him.

01:00.033 --> 01:01.200
You don't think
that's a big deal?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.033
- Let's go.
- I don't know,

01:03.033 --> 01:06.033
honestly, what people
can come at me for.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.567
- And you blame your
tone deafness on my lyrics?

01:08.567 --> 01:10.433
- You knew
about the Tom

01:10.433 --> 01:12.533
and her friend's
whole situation.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.567
- If he kissed another girl
it's not 'cause he doesn't

01:14.567 --> 01:16.533
"like to kiss."
- You didn't even call me

01:16.533 --> 01:18.533
when my father died.
- I just, I need a minute.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.200
I'm sorry.
Why is this, like,

01:20.200 --> 01:22.200
harder than my divorce?

01:22.200 --> 01:23.633
- Two minutes, everybody.

01:26.233 --> 01:29.367
- Kristen, Kristen.
Your boob's hanging out.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.233
- Five seconds.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.367
Five, four, three...

01:34.367 --> 01:36.100
- Let the games start.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.500
- Two...

01:37.500 --> 01:39.233
♪ ♪

01:39.233 --> 01:43.100
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:43.100 --> 01:45.166
♪ This one's
for you tonight... ♪

01:45.166 --> 01:48.233
- Hey, everyone, welcome
to the "Vanderpump Rules"

01:48.233 --> 01:50.767
season six reunion.
I'm Andy Cohen.

01:50.767 --> 01:55.333
Here with Lisa Vanderpump
and the staff of Sur.

01:55.333 --> 01:58.233
And some former Sur staffers.

01:58.233 --> 02:01.000
And some business partners.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.133
- Oh, lordy.
- Lots of relationships here.

02:04.133 --> 02:07.266
It seems like with this group
things are always changing.

02:07.266 --> 02:08.667
So, I want to get some updates.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.266
First, let's get to
the elephant in the room.

02:11.266 --> 02:12.500
Jax and Brittany.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.000
You two are together?
- Yes.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.400
- Yeah, we are.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.000
- It's been a rollercoaster
that's for sure.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.633
- Well, I am anxious
to get the full story.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.500
Stassi, is Patrick
in the picture?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.367
- No, not at all.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.767
- I do.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.333
- Wow.
- Yes.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.333
- Scheana, are you
and Rob still together?

02:31.333 --> 02:33.266
- No, we haven't been together
since August.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.367
- Wow.
Has everything changed?

02:35.367 --> 02:37.533
James, are you
still with Logan?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.400
- I'm still with Raquel.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.133
- Yes.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.166
Still together?
- We're still together.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.433
You both seem glowing.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.567
- It's the bronzer.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.300
- Lala, how are you

02:50.300 --> 02:52.100
and your man doing?
- We're great.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.567
Thank you for asking.
- Good.

02:53.567 --> 02:55.700
The bigger the hoops,
the happier the girl.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.500
- The bigger the hoops,
the better the blowjob.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.367
- Well, there you go.
And that sets the tone,

03:01.367 --> 03:03.633
doesn't it?
Thank you, Lala.

03:03.633 --> 03:07.233
- So, the season began
with the revelation

03:07.233 --> 03:11.500
that Jax cheated on Brittany
with Faith.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.100
Brittany,
did you have any idea?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.567
- First of all, I love you.
- I love you too.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.533
- I love you.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.000
- I love you.
Before this all gets in,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.500
I need to say that.
- Okay, so--

03:20.500 --> 03:22.266
well, Brittany,
what was your first thought

03:22.266 --> 03:24.266
when you heard this?
- He was actually talking

03:24.266 --> 03:26.600
about having kids
right before I found out.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.066
Like to other people.
We were working out together.

03:29.066 --> 03:30.333
I thought everything was fine.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.400
So, I was
completely blindsided.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.266
I didn't think that he was
gonna actually cheat on me.

03:35.266 --> 03:37.467
Everybody also was saying
how much he's changed.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.166
And How, like,
good I was for him.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.266
And even though I wasn't
around, like, before that

03:41.266 --> 03:43.734
Like, I still felt like
maybe I was making him change.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.567
So, it was just hard.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.333
- Brittany, you were
and you have.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.467
- Because I believed it.
- I put her through the ringer.

03:49.467 --> 03:51.700
And I was manipulative.
- Well, I'm glad to see you...

03:51.700 --> 03:53.333
- And I didn't see it.
- Admit that.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.066
- I didn't see it.
- Jax, you were kind of

03:55.066 --> 03:57.266
a ----ing dick
this summer, dude.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.200
I mean, straight up.
The way you acted

03:59.200 --> 04:01.734
and the things that you did
had ----ing collateral damage.

04:01.734 --> 04:04.166
I mean, me and Ariana
got into the worst argument

04:04.166 --> 04:07.767
we've ever gotten into
because of your bullsh--.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.500
- Jax, Faith told James
that you hooked up with her

04:10.500 --> 04:13.233
in front of an ailing
95-year-old woman.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.233
- I didn't see that.

04:15.233 --> 04:16.600
- No.
- So bad.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.166
That's so bad.
- You were in

04:18.166 --> 04:19.633
an elderly woman's home?

04:19.633 --> 04:21.600
- I guess.
- That she was taking care of.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.233
- Yeah.
- And this elderly woman was--

04:23.233 --> 04:25.200
- I don't know anything
about that anymore--

04:25.200 --> 04:27.300
- I feel bad for that woman.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.700
- Listen--
- I feel so bad for that woman.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.500
- I don't want you
to hear any of this.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.467
- I feel bad for whoever hired
that horrible person

04:32.467 --> 04:34.100
that would do that
to an old lady.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.767
- I didn't know I was
in an old woman's house.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.633
It looked like--it did look
like an old woman's house.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.233
But I didn't know there was
like an old woman in there.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.066
- That's
the million-dollar question.

04:46.066 --> 04:49.100
I know, um--
like, we were arguing a lot.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.633
A lot--
and I'm not--that's not--

04:50.633 --> 04:52.400
again, I'm not--
I'm telling you why

04:52.400 --> 04:54.533
I did what I did.
And that's my way

04:54.533 --> 04:56.133
of trying to get out
of a relationship.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.667
That's what I do.
I cheat.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.600
- Were you trying to sabotage
your relationship?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.367
- I feel like
I said it with Stassi.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.200
And I feel like I said it
with all my ex-girlfriends.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.266
Instead of, you know,
being an adult

05:06.266 --> 05:10.467
and actually, you know,
getting help,

05:10.467 --> 05:13.734
and trying to figure out why--
why we do these things--

05:13.734 --> 05:16.633
I do these things.
And, um--

05:16.633 --> 05:18.667
I take the coward way out.
And I hate to say this

05:18.667 --> 05:20.367
and it sounds
disgusting and trashy

05:20.367 --> 05:22.367
but it could have been anybody
who walked by.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.233
That's just the person
that was paying attention to me

05:24.233 --> 05:25.633
at the time.
It really didn't matter.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.266
Could have been a damn hole
in the wall.

05:27.266 --> 05:29.400
It didn't matter.
- I was paying you, always,

05:29.400 --> 05:30.700
so much attention.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.300
So that's what
I don't understand.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.100
- And I know that.
- I always gave you

05:34.100 --> 05:35.533
even more attention
than you ever deserved from me.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.033
- I know, I know, and it's--

05:37.033 --> 05:38.567
- That's why
it's so ----ed up.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.033
- Schwartz, Brittany asked you
if you knew anything

05:41.033 --> 05:43.633
about Jax cheating.
You said you didn't.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.300
But you said to her face,
"I didn't know,

05:46.300 --> 05:48.700
but I would cover for him
and lie to you if he did."

05:48.700 --> 05:51.266
- I was just being
radically honest.

05:51.266 --> 05:52.500
But it's probably true.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.433
I would have--
I mean, I--

05:54.433 --> 05:57.033
- Why do you have
such blind loyalty to him?

05:57.033 --> 05:59.166
- I don't know.
Well, I mean--

05:59.166 --> 06:02.300
Honestly, both Jax and Tom
were instrumental

06:02.300 --> 06:05.433
in my transition here.
And they did so much for me.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.033
They helped me get
my first agencies.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.533
And they were just, um--

06:08.533 --> 06:10.433
Yeah, I just care
a lot about them.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.400
- There's no justifying
any of this.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.734
- No, no.
I'm saying, clearly--

06:13.734 --> 06:16.700
- Tom, Tom.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.600
- Don't defend that sh--.
- I'm not defending him.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.266
- I have a heart of,
like, gold--

06:21.266 --> 06:23.166
er, gold, sorry.
It's black.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.567
I'm sorry.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.467
Ever since
everything's been happening,

06:26.467 --> 06:29.066
I'm starting to feel.
Like, I never really felt bad.

06:29.066 --> 06:30.700
You even called me out
on it many times.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.000
- We have had this conversation
for five years straight.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.433
- Yeah, no conscience.
- I just started to feel

06:34.433 --> 06:36.567
like, "What the
did I do?"

06:36.567 --> 06:38.467
- Brittany, when Jax
admitted to cheating

06:38.467 --> 06:39.667
you said you
were going to Vegas

06:39.667 --> 06:41.266
"to be single."

06:41.266 --> 06:42.700
But you didn't hook up
with anyone there.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.600
You came home and had sex
with Jax, right away.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.400
Why?
- I've talked about it

06:47.400 --> 06:49.400
with some other women
who have came to me

06:49.400 --> 06:51.266
and they were like,
"I did the exact same thing."

06:51.266 --> 06:53.467
- It's called
quick claiming your spouse.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.467
- Exactly.
- She didn't have to claim me.

06:55.467 --> 06:57.467
- I wanted to feel
like I was that person.

06:57.467 --> 06:59.467
I was the most important.
I was the best.

06:59.467 --> 07:01.066
- It's so true, Brittany.
- I know a lot of people

07:01.066 --> 07:03.066
think that that's crazy.
And I get that too.

07:03.066 --> 07:04.233
Because a lot of women
wouldn't go back to him.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.600
And I understand.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.633
It was just like
an emotional, mental thing

07:07.633 --> 07:09.567
that you can't really explain
but it's just--

07:09.567 --> 07:12.200
I wanted him with me.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.433
- I wanna switch gears
for a second.

07:14.433 --> 07:18.166
Lala, after having left
the restaurant last year,

07:18.166 --> 07:21.333
you came back and begged Lisa
for your Job back.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.367
Why did you wanna come back?

07:23.367 --> 07:25.467
- I felt like...

07:25.467 --> 07:28.767
in previous years,
like, I kind of was thrown

07:28.767 --> 07:31.767
into a group of people
who had been together

07:31.767 --> 07:33.367
for a very long time,

07:33.367 --> 07:36.133
and after I left,

07:36.133 --> 07:38.233
Scheana reached out to me.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.200
And I just felt
for the first time

07:40.200 --> 07:43.133
like it was a safe place
for me to be in.

07:43.133 --> 07:45.500
- I knew who you were

07:45.500 --> 07:47.133
and I wanted everyone else
to see it.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.633
- And this year
it seems like everybody else

07:49.633 --> 07:51.266
finally got to see who you are.

07:51.266 --> 07:52.533
And now
everybody loves you so--

07:52.533 --> 07:54.000
- But then I get sh-- on.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.266
- I'm not sh---ing
on you, Scheana.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.633
I actually have told you--

07:56.633 --> 07:58.100
- You kind of did a lot
this season

07:58.100 --> 07:59.333
from what I've seen.
- Same.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.133
- Your interview bites
are mean.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.233
- What did she say specifically
that was mean?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.266
- I mean,
the tone deaf thing was rude.

08:05.266 --> 08:08.367
♪ You, you, you, you, you ♪

08:08.367 --> 08:11.133
♪ You, you, you, you, you ♪

08:11.133 --> 08:12.600
- The girl is tone deaf.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.266
- You were the one who said
you wanted this.

08:14.266 --> 08:16.533
- I didn't make you sing.
I didn't sit there

08:16.533 --> 08:18.367
and hold a gun
to your head and say,

08:18.367 --> 08:20.400
"You better get in there
and sing, 'you, you, you.'"

08:20.400 --> 08:21.700
- I never said that I said--
- And then you blame

08:21.700 --> 08:24.033
your tone deafness
on my lyrics?

08:24.033 --> 08:26.000
- It was the way you said it.
I said that was rude.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
- Lala, you made fun
of my trumpet playing too.

08:31.667 --> 08:35.033
- Sandoval's trumpet playing
reminds me

08:35.033 --> 08:37.533
of baby dolphins
just learning to communicate

08:37.533 --> 08:38.633
for the first time.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.500
- Honey, I'm the first person

08:46.500 --> 08:48.100
to jump in
with baby dolphins and...

08:48.100 --> 08:49.700
All day long.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.533
- The way I've seen you speak
about your new friends

08:51.533 --> 08:53.300
and speak about me
in your interviews

08:53.300 --> 08:55.133
is just a very different tone.
- Because you don't know

08:55.133 --> 08:58.266
how to talk about anything else
besides you, you, you.

08:58.266 --> 09:00.700
And I'm over it.

09:00.700 --> 09:05.333
I have gone through many months
of hearing just about Scheana.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.066
All I hear you say is,

09:07.066 --> 09:09.200
"my man this, my man that,
my man this."

09:09.200 --> 09:11.333
Scheana.
Come on, dude.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.333
- We gotta take a break.
We'll be back.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.300
Coming up.
- You go to Mexico

09:18.300 --> 09:20.600
and he's pissed at you
because you didn't call him

09:20.600 --> 09:22.200
right when you got off
the ----ing plane.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
- Okay, I mean--
in a nutshell, yes.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.166
That is what it is.
.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.100
- We are back with
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.633
James, between this season
and last season,

09:42.633 --> 09:46.033
Logan is the third person,
that's not your girlfriend,

09:46.033 --> 09:48.467
to claim to have had sex
with you.

09:48.467 --> 09:53.033
First it was Ellie from Pump,
GG from Sur, and now Logan.

09:53.033 --> 09:55.367
That's a lot of smoke
for their not to be any fire.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.166
- Right, yeah.
What can I say?

09:57.166 --> 09:59.367
- Why do you think
everyone wants to say

09:59.367 --> 10:01.066
that they've

10:01.066 --> 10:02.567
- I don't know.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.066
Probably 'cause everybody
does want to --

10:04.066 --> 10:05.500
- No, no, no, no, no.
Let's get it

10:05.500 --> 10:08.066
real straight again.
My man is Kanye.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.100
He's the white Ray J now.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.367
So, what does she think
about everyone...

10:12.367 --> 10:15.500
Sucking off white Ray J?

10:15.500 --> 10:18.734
Is what I'd like to know.

10:18.734 --> 10:21.233
- This is awkward.
- Yeah--

10:21.233 --> 10:22.767
- I have to ask you
this question.

10:22.767 --> 10:25.533
Have you ever
hooked up with Logan?

10:25.533 --> 10:26.600
- No.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.133
Made out?
- No.

10:28.133 --> 10:29.467
- And I've never dipped

10:29.467 --> 10:31.400
in the men pool
in my life, either.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.333
Do you care about me
more than anything?

10:36.333 --> 10:37.633
- Of course.
- Okay.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.133
Do I think
you're in love with me?

10:39.133 --> 10:40.367
Absolutely.
- Oh, you're in love

10:40.367 --> 10:42.000
with me also, so  off.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.200
- As a best friend, yes.
- Oh, as more.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.467
I love you.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.066
As--a lot more.

10:47.066 --> 10:49.133
- But if people want
to think otherwise

10:49.133 --> 10:51.133
or I've dipped
in the men pool with Logan

10:51.133 --> 10:52.533
or any other one person,
that's fine.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.000
- Why is Kristen
commenting on this?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.133
- Because she knows you well.
She dated you for a few years.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.533
- He asked her.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.200
He asked her.
You need to stop talking

11:01.200 --> 11:03.000
when other people are talking.
- I mean, I think

11:03.000 --> 11:05.166
where there's smoke
there's fire most of the time.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.133
So, I think GG and Ellie.
Yeah, for sure.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.500
Do I...

11:09.500 --> 11:11.633
assume something
happened with Logan?

11:11.633 --> 11:13.500
It feels that way.
- James--

11:13.500 --> 11:15.400
- You chilled and cuddled with
me on the hood of your Beamer,

11:15.400 --> 11:17.166
don't you forget.
- Oh, stop it.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.567
You love to deflect.
- It's not about who did what.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.500
It's the craziest thing.
- So, listen--so, listen.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
- This is what you guys
are just alike about.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.667
You two are so much alike
because you deflect.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.400
- Am I losing
my deflecting title?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.767
But she did the same thing,

11:27.767 --> 11:29.400
so whatever.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.400
I don't care who
anyone thinks I dipped in here,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.033
dipped in there, okay?
I know exactly

11:33.033 --> 11:35.433
what I've dipped
my willy in, all right?

11:35.433 --> 11:38.700
- This year we watched someone
obsess over a boyfriend

11:38.700 --> 11:40.567
who just did not...

11:40.567 --> 11:42.500
- Seem that into them.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.166
Stassi,
let's talk about Patrick.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.734
- Yes.

11:45.734 --> 11:47.467
- So embarrassing.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.266
It was horrifying
to watch back.

11:49.266 --> 11:51.066
You were dating
for a few years

11:51.066 --> 11:53.700
and then you broke up.
What brought you back together?

11:53.700 --> 11:55.600
God, .
I don't know.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.734
I feel stupid.
- We were all shaking our head.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.533
- Don't feel stupid.
We all watched him

11:59.533 --> 12:01.734
and thought he was disgusting.
So don't feel stupid.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.000
You look amazing.
He looks disgusting.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.066
You--So, he goes--

12:06.066 --> 12:08.266
Wait, I wanna ask this.
- Wait, I gotta get--

12:08.266 --> 12:09.667
this is ----ing crazy.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.700
- Hold on, hold on.
He goes to Amsterdam

12:11.700 --> 12:13.567
and like, he's like--
- You know what goes down

12:13.567 --> 12:15.066
in Amsterdam.
- What did we decide

12:15.066 --> 12:16.533
about Amsterdam?
I'm not gonna talk to you

12:16.533 --> 12:18.200
while I'm there.
And then when I get back--

12:18.200 --> 12:19.567
- He blocked your number.
- You're not gonna ask me

12:19.567 --> 12:21.300
what happened
while I was there.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.600
And then you go to Mexico
and he's pissed at you

12:23.600 --> 12:25.467
because you didn't call him
right when you got off

12:25.467 --> 12:27.333
the ----ing plane.
- Okay.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.500
- Exactly.
- I mean, in a nutshell, yes.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.433
That is what it is.
.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.700
- Outside of your relationship
I do think he's a cool dude

12:33.700 --> 12:36.767
but, I mean, I feel like
it was terribly toxic.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.200
- I think--
- Watching it back

12:38.200 --> 12:39.767
was really hard.
And to see you

12:39.767 --> 12:42.300
you in all your glory,
just, like, to be neutralized

12:42.300 --> 12:44.734
like that, and like, oh, man.
It broke my heart.

12:44.734 --> 12:47.066
- Yeah, he's a smotherer.
He smothered the flame.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.633
- If you care about somebody

12:48.633 --> 12:50.100
and you don't know
their other half,

12:50.100 --> 12:52.500
but you see
how unhappy she's been

12:52.500 --> 12:55.300
over the last four years,
I didn't think it was possibly

12:55.300 --> 12:57.567
the right relationship for her.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.467
- Stassi,
when you saw the episode

12:59.467 --> 13:02.200
where Patrick told
Katie and Kristen

13:02.200 --> 13:04.066
that you could
bang other guys,

13:04.066 --> 13:05.734
just not date other guys.

13:05.734 --> 13:08.100
- I saw that on TV.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.600
Like that's how
I found out about it.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.533
- Again, horrified.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.133
- I mean she can bang
other dudes

13:13.133 --> 13:14.767
she just can't date other guys.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.533
She doesn't have any game.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.667
- Her game is about
this ding-a-ling.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.400
- I would have been hooking up
with dudes if I knew that.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.533
Like, that would have been
four years of fun.

13:24.533 --> 13:27.400
- Patrick used a lot
of big words--

13:27.400 --> 13:30.066
- You had no clue
what you were doing.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.133
And somehow you've turned it
into a juggernaut.

13:32.133 --> 13:35.000
- You have a unique ability

13:35.000 --> 13:38.533
to like, galvanize people.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.633
- And you have to treat
every relationship

13:40.633 --> 13:43.633
like, myopically.

13:43.633 --> 13:45.600
- Jax, do you know what
"myopic" means?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.633
- No, I watched that scene

13:47.633 --> 13:49.533
and she said,
"I don't understand."

13:49.533 --> 13:51.567
I was like, "Thank God."
If Stassi didn't understand

13:51.567 --> 13:54.000
half of what he said
then I'm like, I'm safe.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.300
Because, see,
I was listening to that

13:55.300 --> 13:57.133
and watching it.
I'm looking around like,

13:57.133 --> 13:59.100
"I don't know what anything
he's saying right now."

13:59.100 --> 14:00.567
Not one word.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.400
- Did you ever have any
curiosity to, like,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.166
look anything up?
- No.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.033
- I don't either, so...

14:07.433 --> 14:08.700
- It's cool.
I've made it this far in life.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.133
- Yes.
- I'm okay.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.133
- Stassi, the viewers
had very strong responses

14:14.133 --> 14:15.700
to Patrick.
Here's some of the names used

14:15.700 --> 14:18.000
to describe him
on social media.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.266
Smug, condescending, turd,
Douchecanoe, and dickarooney.

14:22.266 --> 14:25.433
- I would have been surprised
if I hadn't seen the show.

14:25.433 --> 14:27.367
- That was just me
that said it, wasn't it?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.133
- I do know
what all those words mean.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.700
- Well, because you've been
called them, yeah.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.600
- 'Cause I am one.
I know.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.066
- Also, the way he was
to me in the final episode.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.734
- That was so embarrassing.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.333
- Hold on,
I wanna talk about that.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.333
- Let's get to that later.
Yeah.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.700
- Brittany,
you let Stassi give you

14:42.700 --> 14:45.066
a lot of relationship advice
this season.

14:45.066 --> 14:48.400
Yet, here she was
involved in her own drama.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.200
What was your response?
- At your birthday

14:50.200 --> 14:52.400
I think that was the first time
I had ever met him.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.600
I didn't really know that
he acted like that or anything.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.400
That was kind of a shock to me.
- I didn't even know.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.200
It's like I didn't know
until I was out of it

15:00.200 --> 15:02.533
and saw it.
- So when you watched yourself

15:02.533 --> 15:05.400
back with Patrick, what--
- I didn't recognize myself.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.000
- No, not at all.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.467
- I just--

15:09.467 --> 15:13.200
someone who is meek and just
didn't stand up for herself

15:13.200 --> 15:15.633
or didn't--
I just--

15:15.633 --> 15:18.633
I was submissive.
- Ariana, how was the way

15:18.633 --> 15:22.333
that Stassi acted with Patrick
similar to how you acted

15:22.333 --> 15:24.500
in your last relationship?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.734
- Um, there are like--

15:26.734 --> 15:30.333
similarities but I think
my ex went for the jugular

15:30.333 --> 15:33.100
a lot more often
than Patrick probably did.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.734
When I watch her and I see
that she's, like, nervous

15:35.734 --> 15:38.500
that he's gonna disapprove
of what she's saying or doing

15:38.500 --> 15:40.433
or who she's hanging out with
or whatever,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.200
I lived with that constantly.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.734
- Your past was more,
just like, straight up insult

15:44.734 --> 15:47.333
versus hers, was more like--
- But there was also a lot

15:47.333 --> 15:49.066
of like,
"I'm gonna try to make sure

15:49.066 --> 15:51.066
"that I don't get insulted
or I don't get

15:51.066 --> 15:52.767
into these arguments,"
so...

15:52.767 --> 15:55.734
"I'm gonna try to do everything
that I can to make sure

15:55.734 --> 15:58.533
"that he approves
of everything I'm doing

15:58.533 --> 16:01.000
and he likes everything
I'm doing, wearing, saying."

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
All of that.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.500
And I'm glad
that you're out of that.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.233
I'm glad
that I'm out of that.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.000
- I just feel like
I wasted so much time.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.633
Like...

16:10.633 --> 16:12.633
- You didn't waste time
it was a learning experience.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.500
Don't think you've wasted time.
- Four years is a long time.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.667
- So, what did you learn
from your relationship

16:16.667 --> 16:19.533
with Patrick that you can
apply to future relationships?

16:19.533 --> 16:22.100
- I want to be able to wake up
and live my life

16:22.100 --> 16:24.066
the exact way that
I want to live it

16:24.066 --> 16:25.734
every--that's all I want.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.200
I want someone to just...

16:29.200 --> 16:32.533
Just, really love me.
Accept me.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.734
That's all I want.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.300
- It's okay.
- She...

16:40.300 --> 16:42.033
- It's okay.

16:42.033 --> 16:44.033
- My mom was
on the phone screaming,

16:44.033 --> 16:46.233
"Your father's dead."

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
- Welcome back to
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.400
Ariana, Tom said
at the beginning of the season

16:59.400 --> 17:02.033
that you two
hadn't had sex for two months.

17:02.033 --> 17:03.667
What caused the dry spell?

17:03.667 --> 17:05.166
- I think there's
a lot of things

17:05.166 --> 17:07.133
that caused the dry spell.9

17:07.133 --> 17:11.433
Me feeling uncomfortable
being touched in certain ways.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.567
Uncomfortability with myself.

17:13.567 --> 17:16.266
And then I think
compounded by us being busy

17:16.266 --> 17:18.700
and not spending time together
and, like, really building

17:18.700 --> 17:21.667
and working on that intimacy.
There's a lot of things.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.433
- We would start
getting in the mood

17:23.433 --> 17:26.266
and she'd be like, "No, no, no.
Why do you do that?"

17:26.266 --> 17:28.133
- No, but it also was like--
- But also--

17:28.133 --> 17:30.667
- When you're--
no, you would--

17:30.667 --> 17:34.433
this is gonna be
real explicit real quick.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.333
You'd wanna go down on me--
- Oh.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.033
- I would put the brakes on
because I felt uncomfortable

17:39.033 --> 17:40.734
with that.

17:40.734 --> 17:43.600
- Lisa, what is it like seeing
someone as beautiful as Ariana

17:43.600 --> 17:45.433
struggle with body issues?
- Please don't

17:45.433 --> 17:47.266
call me beautiful.
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.066
- Ariana, you're stunning.

17:50.066 --> 17:51.567
- Gorgeous.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.200
- The other day
I was in my, like, gym clothes

17:53.200 --> 17:56.166
or something and he, was, like,
getting up on me

17:56.166 --> 17:58.000
and he was like,
wanna know whatever,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.333
and I was like,
"I'm disgusting right now.'

17:59.333 --> 18:01.166
And he's like,
"I think you're sexy."

18:01.166 --> 18:02.467
And I literally was like,
"Well, then you must have

18:02.467 --> 18:04.500
horrible judgment."
- No, I don't.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.767
- I think women often feel
if they're not kind of perfect

18:07.767 --> 18:09.600
that they don't
really want a man's head

18:09.600 --> 18:11.633
literally up the skirt.
- Ugh.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.567
both: They're better.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.333
- I mean, we're not, like,
banging it out everyday

18:16.333 --> 18:18.767
but we've come a long way
and we're working towards

18:18.767 --> 18:21.433
being at the best.
And I also think that

18:21.433 --> 18:24.233
we're working towards it
from a really honest place.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.600
And I think that
that's better than me

18:26.600 --> 18:29.066
trying to mask it by just--

18:29.066 --> 18:30.500
- We were kind of doing that,
I feel.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.300
- Do you regret
talking about it

18:33.300 --> 18:35.500
in front of your friends
and on the show?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.166
- Uh, sometimes.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.600
- Uh-huh.
- But I don't regret it

18:38.600 --> 18:41.633
when I see people
who watch the show

18:41.633 --> 18:44.200
contact me and say that
they feel the same way.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.767
It also makes
me feel better knowing

18:45.767 --> 18:47.333
that I'm not alone.
And when they know that,

18:47.333 --> 18:49.233
they're not alone.
That's what makes me

18:49.233 --> 18:51.767
not regret it.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.467
- I'm proud of you.
- I wanna switch gears

18:54.467 --> 18:57.233
for a second.
Jax, I know your dad died

18:57.233 --> 18:58.467
last December.
- Yeah.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.500
- And I'm so sorry to hear it.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.667
How did he pass away?
- Cancer.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.266
- Yeah.

19:04.266 --> 19:06.467
- He was my best friend.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.667
Yeah.
Talked to me every day.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.367
Even though
he lives in Florida.

19:09.367 --> 19:11.600
I'd just text him.
Just even about anything.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.266
My father died December 27th.
We were on our way--

19:14.266 --> 19:15.767
it was December 27th--
I just talked to my dad

19:15.767 --> 19:17.400
the night before.
He was on the computer.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.000
"Dad, I love you.
Can't wait to see you."

19:19.000 --> 19:20.500
He was like,
"Can't wait to see you."

19:20.500 --> 19:22.066
I face-timed him.
It was the last thing.

19:22.066 --> 19:24.300
"Love you."
And then after Christmas,

19:24.300 --> 19:28.000
I get that phone call
from my mother.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.767
Sh--.

19:30.767 --> 19:34.266
- It's okay.

19:34.266 --> 19:36.400
It's okay.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.667
It's okay. You can cry.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.233
- We were
actually on the way...

19:42.233 --> 19:45.000
to dinner.
And I had the phone plugged in

19:45.000 --> 19:46.400
and my mom
was on the phone screaming,

19:46.400 --> 19:48.433
"Your father is dead."

19:48.433 --> 19:50.533
And then I had stopped the car
and just collapsed

19:50.533 --> 19:53.567
and she took over.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.033
And ever since then

19:55.033 --> 19:57.300
I can't imagine myself
without her.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.533
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.233
Sorry.
I apologize.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.133
- Do you, um--

20:03.133 --> 20:05.567
do you...

20:05.567 --> 20:08.600
Um, I saw on social media
that several of you flew out

20:08.600 --> 20:11.133
for the funeral in Michigan.
Who went?

20:11.133 --> 20:12.667
- Well, the boys went
to Florida and a few of us...

20:12.667 --> 20:14.433
- So, I had two funerals.

20:14.433 --> 20:17.000
Florida, the guys came.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.033
These guys just flew
to my house in Florida.

20:20.033 --> 20:22.467
Like, I didn't even ask--
Tom went and bought me a suit.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.166
And the girls, too.
Like, they didn't even think.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.266
And they just
get on a plane and fly and--

20:26.266 --> 20:29.166
I mean, what could you ask for.

20:29.166 --> 20:32.066
- Uh, Stassi,
Kristen and Rachel.

20:32.066 --> 20:35.166
- And if I could have
been there, I would have.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.734
- Stassi, I mean,
given your history with Jax,

20:37.734 --> 20:39.600
what made you get on the plane?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.266
- When you know
someone's family,

20:41.266 --> 20:44.300
you can't not go.
Like, it's what you do.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.467
- It's so interesting
because Jax...

20:46.467 --> 20:49.700
Stassi, Kristen,
and your friend Rachel

20:49.700 --> 20:52.166
have two things in common.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.633
They all slept with you,
they all hated you

20:54.633 --> 20:58.767
at some point in their lives,
yet they all were the ones

20:58.767 --> 21:00.567
to show up and support you.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.500
It just says a lot,
of the people they are,

21:02.500 --> 21:05.300
considering, you know,
my past with all of them.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.200
That was just amazing.
- What's the biggest thing

21:07.200 --> 21:09.200
you learned about
Brittany through this ordeal?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.433
- Oh, man.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.100
Just what
kind of person she is.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.233
I mean, I don't think
I've ever been around

21:14.233 --> 21:16.100
somebody so amazing.
I mean, somebody who--

21:16.100 --> 21:18.300
I got that phone call
and literally just took over.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.066
She took over.

21:20.066 --> 21:21.500
Because my brain at that time

21:21.500 --> 21:23.100
I'm like,
it's just going like this.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.066
And she grabbed the phone,
"I got this."

21:25.066 --> 21:28.333
Did the phone, did the planes,
made sure my sister and my mom.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.266
She was just texting away
and I'm just sitting

21:30.266 --> 21:32.233
in the corner just like shaking
and just making sure

21:32.233 --> 21:33.633
that I can
get through it all.

21:33.633 --> 21:35.333
She took over.
And it just like--

21:35.333 --> 21:37.400
after everything
I put this girl through.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.633
After everything--
- Suddenly, you saw

21:38.633 --> 21:41.367
what we've seen.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.133
- And not even a question,
not like,

21:43.133 --> 21:45.100
"Oh, should I do this, Uh..."
No, she's just like

21:45.100 --> 21:46.367
" this.
I love this guy."

21:46.367 --> 21:47.633
- Yeah.
- Listen.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.266
You know, I was just like--
I mean--

21:49.266 --> 21:51.000
- Well, I love you
and I love your family.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.400
There's no where
in the entire world

21:52.400 --> 21:54.000
I would have
rather been.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.266
- I mean, she's been with me
by my side--

21:55.266 --> 21:57.233
And like it's--
Like I said...

21:57.233 --> 21:59.000
It's the utter,
most worst thing in my life

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
that's ever happened
but it's something--

22:01.000 --> 22:03.367
it's brought our relationship--

22:03.367 --> 22:05.266
it's the best it's ever been,
I think right now.

22:05.266 --> 22:06.734
I think we've been better
than we've ever been.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.500
- Wow.
- It's almost like we had

22:08.500 --> 22:10.400
to go through some of
the most horrible things...

22:10.400 --> 22:12.033
- Tom, said it best.
It's almost like,

22:12.033 --> 22:13.700
you start fresh.
- You could ever go through.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.433
To be where we are now.
- And if you can get

22:15.433 --> 22:17.166
through that,
you can get through anything.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.100
- Just, never again, is all.
- This is the first--

22:19.100 --> 22:20.567
I've never been
to a funeral in my life.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.433
This is my first funeral.
- Wow. Oh.

22:22.433 --> 22:24.433
- I've never known anybody
who died before in my life.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.567
So, for your father
to be the first of both...

22:26.567 --> 22:28.667
it's a little rough.
- Wow.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.567
- I just--this is time
where I needed my dad

22:30.567 --> 22:32.667
and she just took over
and it was just amazing.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.100
- Wow.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.400
Well, we're sorry
for your loss.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.567
- Thank you.
- We'll be right back.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.266
- If you think $100,000
is worth 10%--

22:44.266 --> 22:46.233
- Well, it's gonna cost
2 1/2 million.

22:46.233 --> 22:47.567
- It didn't need
to cost that much.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.166
- Well, it does.
- That's your choice.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.567
- If they don't like it,
they can suck it.

22:50.567 --> 22:52.133
You know.

23:01.133 --> 23:04.266
- We watched this year
as Lisa began construction

23:04.266 --> 23:08.066
On the fourth LA restaurant bar

23:08.066 --> 23:10.066
in her Vander-empire.

23:10.066 --> 23:12.066
You've opened a lot of bars
over the years.

23:12.066 --> 23:14.000
- Yeah.
- Why'd you decide to do

23:14.000 --> 23:16.433
this one with Tom Schwartz
and Tom Sandoval?

23:16.433 --> 23:19.033
- I just adore these two
and I think they bring

23:19.033 --> 23:21.467
a great energy to the equation.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.467
They're junior partners,

23:23.467 --> 23:25.734
very junior partners,
and I actually have to tell--

23:25.734 --> 23:28.333
- How emasculating of you.
- Yes, thank you, Lisa.

23:28.333 --> 23:30.066
- I mean,
5% is a junior partner.

23:30.066 --> 23:31.734
However way you put it.
- Yes.

23:31.734 --> 23:34.700
Sandoval, you were concerned
that Lisa was gonna ignore

23:34.700 --> 23:37.767
your ideas and not let you sit
at the grownups table.

23:37.767 --> 23:40.033
Are you there yet?
- Well, I mean,

23:40.033 --> 23:42.633
we're getting there.
- We're not having idea sex

23:42.633 --> 23:44.633
but we're doing some foreplay.
You know?

23:44.633 --> 23:47.367
- What I'm sensing is...

23:47.367 --> 23:51.166
that Sandoval
has more to offer.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.066
He feels that
he has more to offer

23:53.066 --> 23:54.767
than just
the cocktail portion.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.433
- If you're asking me
to do a job

23:56.433 --> 23:57.600
and you want me to do it,
and you want me to have

23:57.600 --> 23:59.333
cutting edge cocktails,

23:59.333 --> 24:01.767
sometimes the décor
has to come second

24:01.767 --> 24:05.033
to functionality, Lisa.
I just, you know--

24:05.033 --> 24:07.200
I was there the other day
and Ken's talking about

24:07.200 --> 24:09.467
putting in this
huge wine fridge.

24:09.467 --> 24:12.367
And I'm thinking to myself,
like, in Boys Town, like,

24:12.367 --> 24:15.166
nobody buys
bottles of wine, Lisa.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.667
- Oh, that's not true at all.
We've got two restaurants on--

24:17.667 --> 24:21.066
- I got to these clubs,
like, multiple days a week.

24:21.066 --> 24:23.100
- Listen, if anybody knows
what the gay boys want,

24:23.100 --> 24:25.233
it's Sandoval.
- It's Sandoval, yeah.

24:25.233 --> 24:26.734
And James, maybe.

24:26.734 --> 24:28.500
- I've been in the market
for a while, so...

24:28.500 --> 24:30.100
- To us it's a ton of money

24:30.100 --> 24:31.533
and this is a huge opportunity
for us.

24:31.533 --> 24:33.600
We're super excited
we're gonna be investors,

24:33.600 --> 24:36.400
ambassadors, promoters.
And we're gonna be proud.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.266
- And I support that.

24:38.266 --> 24:40.367
Of them, like, taking
their life and running with it.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.266
- Oh.
- You know, but I kind of...

24:42.266 --> 24:44.633
I need them to do the things
that they're good at

24:44.633 --> 24:46.133
and me to handle the things
that I know.

24:46.133 --> 24:47.467
- Exactly. We're getting in
where we fit in.

24:47.467 --> 24:49.000
- Lisa,
when you're talking about

24:49.000 --> 24:52.100
if you think $100,000
is worth 10%, I mean--

24:52.100 --> 24:54.400
- Well, it's gonna cost
2 1/2 million

24:54.400 --> 24:56.066
to put together, so--
- It didn't need

24:56.066 --> 24:57.400
to cost that much.
That's your choice.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.300
- Well, it does.
That is my choice.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.433
I think we know
what we're doing.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.567
- I was wondering,
when are these guys

25:04.567 --> 25:07.133
gonna receive money back
on their investment?

25:07.133 --> 25:10.500
- I mean, I can't be right now
talking about

25:10.500 --> 25:11.700
when they're getting
their money back

25:11.700 --> 25:13.300
when I haven't even taken it.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.433
I've never actually
cashed their check.

25:14.433 --> 25:16.367
- Okay, well maybe you need to.

25:16.367 --> 25:19.100
- Well, maybe I'll do it when
they least expect it, okay?

25:19.100 --> 25:22.433
- Is it fair to say
I haven't cashed your checks...

25:22.433 --> 25:24.100
- No, I have--
- Because I'm waiting to see.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.533
I mean,
you're holding it over them--

25:25.533 --> 25:27.000
- No, I'm not.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.567
I definitely
want them involved.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.367
1,000%.

25:30.367 --> 25:33.166
But if they're not happy
with what we're doing,

25:33.166 --> 25:36.567
then--a partnership
has to be a marriage.

25:36.567 --> 25:39.000
- Is this news to you that
she hasn't cashed your checks?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
- No, they know.
They would miss 50 grand

25:41.000 --> 25:43.700
in their bank account.
Come on, they're not that rich.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.266
- Do you have a formal contract
with them?

25:46.266 --> 25:48.033
- Not yet.
But, I mean, I didn't--

25:48.033 --> 25:50.200
I never had a formal contract
with Guillermo.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.667
- Yeah, we just shook hands

25:51.667 --> 25:55.033
and that was it.
- We shook on $50,000--

25:55.033 --> 25:56.600
We're gonna--

25:56.600 --> 25:58.467
- We're gonna iron out
all the rest of the details

25:58.467 --> 26:00.333
as we go along.
- We're gonna figure this out

26:00.333 --> 26:02.033
within the next few weeks.
- Yes.

26:02.033 --> 26:03.333
I don't know.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.700
I don't own a business, but...

26:04.700 --> 26:06.467
Shouldn't have all this
been talked about

26:06.467 --> 26:07.600
before you shake hands?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.333
I didn't discuss--

26:09.333 --> 26:11.400
"
That's a lot of money.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.066
I don't have 50 grand
in the back of my pocket.

26:13.066 --> 26:14.467
- Well, I didn't ask
you for it.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.066
- I'm just curious.
I'm asking.

26:17.066 --> 26:18.600
- I'm giving them
an opportunity

26:18.600 --> 26:20.734
to invest in something--
- But they gotta feel like--

26:20.734 --> 26:22.767
they have
some kind of ownership.

26:22.767 --> 26:25.166
- You're naming it "Tom Tom."
Our name has some value to it.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.700
Otherwise, you wouldn't name it
"Tom Tom."

26:26.700 --> 26:28.734
- Yeah, absolutely.
- That's a good point.

26:28.734 --> 26:31.100
- Are you at all worried
that they're gonna walk in

26:31.100 --> 26:33.567
and not like the choices
that you've made?

26:33.567 --> 26:36.500
- Well, I've got a reputation
for probably, you know,

26:36.500 --> 26:38.767
making some of the most
beautiful restaurants around.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.467
If they don't like it,
they can suck it.

26:40.467 --> 26:42.333
You know?

26:42.333 --> 26:44.367
- Jax, be honest,
were you at all jealous

26:44.367 --> 26:46.467
walking in to Tom Tom
and seeing

26:46.467 --> 26:48.433
what your friends had?
Did you feel left out?

26:48.433 --> 26:49.767
- Of course.
I felt a little left out

26:49.767 --> 26:51.233
but after hearing all this?
No.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.567
Not anymore.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.734
I'm like--
- Sandoval, you made

26:54.734 --> 26:57.233
such a point
about wanting Lisa and Ken

26:57.233 --> 26:59.033
to take you seriously.

26:59.033 --> 27:00.767
Then you went to a club
all night in Vegas

27:00.767 --> 27:05.000
and you drank a Fireball
right before your big meeting

27:05.000 --> 27:07.467
with Lisa and Ken.

27:07.467 --> 27:09.467
- Give me some of that.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.533
First of all...

27:11.533 --> 27:13.734
There wasn't any Diet Coke's
left in our fridge.

27:13.734 --> 27:15.500
- Oh.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.200
- I didn't have any gum.
- So, should she be taking you

27:18.200 --> 27:21.533
more seriously when she sees
you doing Fireball shots

27:21.533 --> 27:23.133
before a meeting?
- Thank you, Andy.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.667
- Well...

27:24.667 --> 27:26.467
Yes.
Because--

27:26.467 --> 27:29.100
I can handle myself
under those kind of situations.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.467
- I mean...

27:30.467 --> 27:32.467
- Okay, I'll go with B.
Probably not.

27:32.467 --> 27:35.533
- The Vegas trip was...

27:35.533 --> 27:38.266
Interesting and entertaining.
I gotta say, Brittany,

27:38.266 --> 27:40.533
that was a good prank
you played on Jax

27:40.533 --> 27:42.600
with the pregnancy test.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.166
It was a little concerning,
to use Katie's words,

27:46.166 --> 27:49.033
that you guys do
the "pray and spray."

27:49.033 --> 27:51.400
- 75% of the time.
- It's "spray and pray."

27:51.400 --> 27:53.400
- Spray and pray.
- That was disgusting.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.166
I shouldn't have said that.
- Do you use any contraception

27:56.166 --> 27:57.700
at all?
- I mean, this is--

27:57.700 --> 27:59.533
- Kind of personal with me.
- This is so awkward.

27:59.533 --> 28:01.033
- Throw me in here,
just like that--

28:01.033 --> 28:02.433
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, no we don't.

28:02.433 --> 28:04.233
Well, I'll tell you
how babies are made.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.433
And basically what you're doing
would make a baby, so...

28:06.433 --> 28:09.266
- Jax, are you ready
to be a dad?

28:10.233 --> 28:12.233
- I'm gonna get into this.
I think my dad

28:12.233 --> 28:16.000
kind of took over for me.
That's how I feel.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.367
And I feel like
he's taking over and he's like,

28:17.367 --> 28:19.300
"You've lived your life
in sh--.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.700
I'm taking over
your body now and--"

28:21.700 --> 28:23.433
So, yes.
I'm ready to be a dad.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.300
I wanna be the best dad.
Just like my father.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.734
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.

28:26.734 --> 28:28.467
Absolutely.
So, yes, if it happens--

28:28.467 --> 28:30.133
If she were to go to me
right now and be like,

28:30.133 --> 28:31.667
"Took a test."
I'd be like, "Yes."

28:31.667 --> 28:33.333
That's why I was like, "Okay."

28:33.333 --> 28:35.467
- Stassi,
will Jax be a good dad?

28:35.467 --> 28:38.200
- I've noticed
that in the last few months

28:38.200 --> 28:40.333
Jax has really changed.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.734
And, I'm not--obviously like,
you're not doing a 180.

28:42.734 --> 28:44.200
You know what I mean?
- No, I understand.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.400
- I've noticed
that you're different.

28:47.400 --> 28:52.066
I--I think that
when that happens that, yes,

28:52.066 --> 28:54.533
I think he would step up.
I do.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.600
- I hate to talk
about what happened.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.700
But I think the worst thing
in my entire life

28:58.700 --> 29:00.200
has happened to me
in a couple of months

29:00.200 --> 29:02.066
And I just--
if I can take anything

29:02.066 --> 29:04.200
good from that, it's just--
I just need to be

29:04.200 --> 29:06.333
the dad that he was.
And be the person that he was.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.033
If I can take
anything from that,

29:08.033 --> 29:10.300
and I know he's watching,
that's who I want to be.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.200
I want to be
exactly how my father is.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.600
Exactly.
To the tee.

29:18.367 --> 29:21.600
- I have loved Rob for 12 years

29:21.600 --> 29:23.233
and he broke my ----ing heart.

29:23.233 --> 29:27.333
For the first time,
that genuinely broke me.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.367
♪ ♪

29:38.367 --> 29:40.500
- Welcome back to
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.333
I'm Andy Cohen.

29:42.333 --> 29:43.633
Scheana,
you're starring in a show

29:43.633 --> 29:45.333
in Las Vegas
right now called

29:45.333 --> 29:48.233
"Sex Tips for
Straight Women from a Gay Man."

29:48.233 --> 29:49.500
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.000
- How is it
being single in Vegas?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.533
- It's a lot of fun.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.266
It's a good place to be single.
I'll say that.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.233
- I've been going out
quite a bit, yeah.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.400
- Lala, you and Scheana
are not still tight.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.600
Why?
- Um...

30:07.600 --> 30:12.133
I felt like
when she got her gig in Vegas,

30:12.133 --> 30:14.734
I let her know how
extremely proud I was of her

30:14.734 --> 30:17.000
and, just like, you know--

30:17.000 --> 30:18.767
I did what friends do.

30:18.767 --> 30:22.400
And I didn't get
a "How's it going?"

30:22.400 --> 30:26.100
And I don't need to sit around
and put 110% in

30:26.100 --> 30:28.266
when someone's
not giving me anything.

30:28.266 --> 30:30.400
- I apologize that while
I was dealing with my break up

30:30.400 --> 30:33.266
over several months
and moving my entire life

30:33.266 --> 30:35.266
to another state and city

30:35.266 --> 30:37.000
and working full time
and doing all of this.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.667
I apologize...
- Mm-hmm.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.633
- That I hadn't
checked in as much.

30:40.633 --> 30:43.033
- When was the last time
you asked me how I'm doing?

30:43.033 --> 30:44.700
- Um, it was
a couple months ago and then--

30:44.700 --> 30:47.567
- After I confronted you about
it being the Scheana show.

30:47.567 --> 30:49.500
- No, actually, it was because
you didn't invite me

30:49.500 --> 30:52.166
on your private jet
because I was "drama."

30:52.166 --> 30:53.700
- Do you remember
the text you sent

30:53.700 --> 30:56.166
when I took everyone
to Vegas?

30:56.166 --> 30:58.433
You said--
- I sent Ariana a text, yeah.

30:58.433 --> 31:00.033
- "Why wouldn't Lala think

31:00.033 --> 31:02.500
that it would make my life
a lot easier?

31:02.500 --> 31:04.166
Don't you think
it would have been great

31:04.166 --> 31:06.000
"for me to pack up
two suitcases

31:06.000 --> 31:07.767
and put them on a PJ?
That would have made my life."

31:07.767 --> 31:09.700
- When I'm driving to Vegas
the next day, I was like--

31:09.700 --> 31:11.233
- I didn't know I was supposed
to make your life easier.

31:11.233 --> 31:13.066
- But as
one of my closest friends,

31:13.066 --> 31:14.467
you're literally flying
to the city I'm moving in--

31:14.467 --> 31:16.200
- Sorry, I should have kicked
you all off.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.667
We could have put the furniture
on the PJ too.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.734
- I'm moving to Vegas
literally that week--

31:20.734 --> 31:23.200
- Next time I will make sure
that my man knows

31:23.200 --> 31:25.333
when you have a gig somewhere
that we need to fuel the jet.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.066
- I'm actually good
on the private jet, thank you.

31:27.066 --> 31:29.300
- Yeah, that's why
I had you fly Southwest back.

31:30.567 --> 31:32.066
- I want to move on.

31:32.066 --> 31:33.734
Scheana,
we met your new boyfriend

31:33.734 --> 31:35.734
but I'm not sure
you ever mentioned his name.

31:35.734 --> 31:37.300
- I don't think I did.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.467
Is that who

31:38.467 --> 31:40.200
we're talking about?
- Yeah.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.033
- I don't know that I said
that much this season.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.467
- No.

31:43.467 --> 31:45.734
- Rob's never mad.
I've never in 11 years

31:45.734 --> 31:47.266
seen him mad.

31:47.266 --> 31:49.533
Rob, he likes coffee
with his creamer.

31:49.533 --> 31:50.734
Like I can't wait, for like,

31:50.734 --> 31:52.567
Rob and I to get a house
one day.

31:52.567 --> 31:54.300
Rob and I are going
to have like, two kids.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.500
Rob makes me so ----ing happy.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.734
- You and Rob dated
before you married Shay.

31:58.734 --> 32:01.166
- Yes.
- And then you...

32:01.166 --> 32:03.567
split up, obviously.
You told Lisa

32:03.567 --> 32:05.633
that the whole time
you were married to Shay

32:05.633 --> 32:07.767
you were thinking about Rob.

32:07.767 --> 32:09.767
- The day I got married,
one of my bridesmaids

32:09.767 --> 32:12.567
who knew Rob and I's
past relationship

32:12.567 --> 32:15.300
had said something
that made me think of him

32:15.300 --> 32:17.033
and I did
think of him that day.

32:17.033 --> 32:18.433
He crossed my mind.
It was always kind of

32:18.433 --> 32:21.066
one of those, what-if's.

32:21.066 --> 32:24.100
- In 2006,
I had just graduated college.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.600
Moved out to LA.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.066
There was Joseph's
on Wednesday's in Hollywood

32:29.066 --> 32:31.100
and then I think it was called
The Lobby at the time

32:31.100 --> 32:33.600
and that was like a, whatever,
Wednesday/Thursday night thing.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.100
And he was the door guy
at both of these places.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.066
We had our first kiss
at Disneyland

32:38.066 --> 32:39.667
When the snow fell
and the fireworks went off.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.600
- Can we do
the short version of this?

32:41.600 --> 32:43.400
- I'm just saying, it was--
- I feel like I'm on

32:43.400 --> 32:46.000
the magic Disney ride here.
- Are you feeling like,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.233
"Wrap it up?"
- Yeah, a little bit.

32:48.233 --> 32:50.667
- The short version is...

32:50.667 --> 32:53.633
You were in different places
in your life.

32:53.633 --> 32:55.400
- But different places
at different times.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.333
- Scheana,
things were going well

32:57.333 --> 33:00.266
then your friends brought up
a rumor that Rob kissed a girl.

33:00.266 --> 33:03.066
Why did you not
want to hear what Kristen

33:03.066 --> 33:04.333
and Brittany had to say?

33:04.333 --> 33:08.233
Do you think
you were in denial?

33:08.233 --> 33:11.200
- That was the moment
he pulled away.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.000
- He pulled away
after that rumor?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.467
- Yes.
And I never, ever, ever meant

33:15.467 --> 33:18.433
to discredit Shay,
because he was ----ing amazing.

33:18.433 --> 33:20.400
And the thing about Shay was:

33:20.400 --> 33:23.166
he had my back
for all five seasons.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.700
Even when he felt
I threw him under the bus

33:25.700 --> 33:28.266
and put his addiction out there
and did all of this, like--

33:28.266 --> 33:30.300
he never left me
because of the show.

33:30.300 --> 33:34.700
And for Rob to just so quickly,
shut off from me--

33:34.700 --> 33:37.100
- How did the break up happen
and when?

33:37.100 --> 33:39.533
- It was about two weeks
after we wrapped.

33:39.533 --> 33:43.700
And that's where I, and like--
Lala, Ariana, Brittany and I

33:43.700 --> 33:47.000
we've all--I'm like--
is this like a calculated move?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.667
Like, it was, like,
did you just stay with me

33:48.667 --> 33:50.700
to finish filming the show?
Because you didn't want me

33:50.700 --> 33:53.233
to have to have a storyline
of another break up

33:53.233 --> 33:55.033
and deal with that.
Like, okay, thank you.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.533
I think?

33:56.533 --> 33:58.033
But two weeks after--

33:58.033 --> 34:00.066
- Yeah.

34:00.066 --> 34:03.200
- Manipulation at its finest.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.567
Holy .

34:04.567 --> 34:08.166
- He's now texting Jax.
Texting my--

34:09.433 --> 34:10.600
- He's texted me
a couple times.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.166
- He text him.

34:12.166 --> 34:13.467
- Yes!
- To hang out.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.133
To go hang out,
have a drink.

34:15.133 --> 34:17.066
Last couple weeks.
- One person at a time.

34:17.066 --> 34:18.433
I'm so overwhelmed.
- Scheana, I'm sorry

34:18.433 --> 34:20.700
that we all see it
in the same way of--

34:20.700 --> 34:22.600
call a spade a spade, right?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.700
- Scheana, why does
that make you so emotional?

34:24.700 --> 34:27.600
- Because I was head over heels
in love with him.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.433
I was for a really long time
and it didn't work out.

34:30.433 --> 34:32.700
But...
I...

34:32.700 --> 34:36.266
have loved Rob for twelve years
and he broke my ----ing heart.

34:36.266 --> 34:40.533
For the first time,
that genuinely broke me.

34:40.533 --> 34:43.033
The divorce--
there were so many things

34:43.033 --> 34:44.600
that I was able to justify.
We shouldn't be together

34:44.600 --> 34:46.200
for this, this, that,
and the other.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.767
But Rob...

34:47.767 --> 34:50.633
genuinely broke
my ----ing heart.

34:50.633 --> 34:54.367
- So, let's not forget this guy
is coming into her life

34:54.367 --> 34:57.233
on her show.
With her cameras.

34:57.233 --> 34:59.300
Knowing that that's
going to be aired.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.734
- While sh---ing on the though.
While talking sh-- on it

35:01.734 --> 35:04.066
though, at the same time.
- And he was there

35:04.066 --> 35:06.166
because of her.
So, to humiliate her

35:06.166 --> 35:08.734
was totally unfair.
- What pissed me off the most

35:08.734 --> 35:12.500
is that Rob was so,
"I'm not doing this show."

35:12.500 --> 35:16.567
And then go to every red carpet
and every Vanderpump dog--

35:16.567 --> 35:19.433
like, event.
Anything Lisa ever threw--

35:19.433 --> 35:21.734
Literally all I'm saying
is that Rob threw a fit

35:21.734 --> 35:23.500
that he did not want
to be a part of the show

35:23.500 --> 35:25.133
but had no problem
being a part of the show

35:25.133 --> 35:26.533
and then sh---ing on her.

35:26.533 --> 35:29.133
- Sche-shoe, I know
we've had our issues.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.500
I know we have.

35:30.500 --> 35:33.266
But...
this girl put in her heart

35:33.266 --> 35:37.400
and soul and effort
into everything she did.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.400
And the fact that--
my man is the only reason why

35:40.400 --> 35:43.200
Rob ever came around.
Do you remember this?

35:43.200 --> 35:46.100
It happened three times.
Rob would say

35:46.100 --> 35:48.000
he's going with
a group of friends.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.600
Scheana would not be invited.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.767
She would be upset,
understandably.

35:51.767 --> 35:54.533
And the only time he would
come out and bail on plans

35:54.533 --> 35:56.333
is when my boyfriend
would text him

35:56.333 --> 35:57.767
and say,
"Hey, do you wanna come out?"

35:57.767 --> 36:00.133
Scheana, I wanted to deck him.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.633
The way he treated her...

36:01.633 --> 36:04.734
was not only not okay,
but it was the behavior

36:04.734 --> 36:07.266
of someone who doesn't
want to be with someone else.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.433
- Scheana, in Big Bear,
Rob told Jax and Sandoval that

36:10.433 --> 36:14.700
"I love you" wasn't something
he threw around lightly.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.133
- Now her whole thing is,
she's like, "I love you."

36:17.133 --> 36:19.500
And she's like,
"but should we say it back?"

36:19.500 --> 36:21.166
I do love her as a person.
And I definitely

36:21.166 --> 36:23.433
have love feelings.
But that word is something

36:23.433 --> 36:25.300
you just don't--
you don't throw it around.

36:25.300 --> 36:28.033
- From that conversation,
it seemed like he hadn't said,

36:28.033 --> 36:29.400
"I love you" yet.
Had he?

36:29.400 --> 36:31.233
- He had.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.500
So, Jax, why were you so quick
to tell everyone that Rob

36:34.500 --> 36:36.567
said that he didn't ever
say that to her?

36:36.567 --> 36:39.233
- I said exactly what he said.
Like he only--he didn't go out.

36:39.233 --> 36:40.567
He said,
"I don't say it all the time."

36:40.567 --> 36:42.367
He's like,
"Of course I love her."

36:42.367 --> 36:44.266
But it just seemed like
he wasn't in love with her.

36:44.266 --> 36:45.700
- Andy said--
Andy just asked why were you

36:45.700 --> 36:47.567
so quick to go
and tell everyone about it?

36:47.567 --> 36:49.333
- You have to own
the fact that you--

36:49.333 --> 36:51.667
- Why were you so quick to go
yap about it right after?

36:51.667 --> 36:53.266
- That he said
he wasn't in love with her.

36:53.266 --> 36:55.200
Why were you so quick?

36:55.200 --> 36:57.066
- Sometimes--he was just
stirring the pot like--

36:57.066 --> 36:58.400
- Don't you make excuses
for him.

37:00.066 --> 37:01.567
- Shut up, Schwartz.
- Schwartz.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.333
- We've all taken punches.
Now it's about you.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.734
Answer the question.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.133
- I'm sorry.
- Get up and let her sit here.

37:09.133 --> 37:11.166
Give her the card.

37:11.166 --> 37:14.467
- 'Cause Jax loves to deflect
anything off himself.

37:14.467 --> 37:17.000
You sit around and try to set

37:17.000 --> 37:18.667
up her on dates and everything.
- That was after.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.133
- You can't even keep
your own damn relationships.

37:21.133 --> 37:23.166
- Because you did this to me--
- Mind your own business.

37:23.166 --> 37:25.200
- I was like, "Okay, you wanna
play hardball, I'm game."

37:25.200 --> 37:27.333
- Your own boy--the guy
that you supposedly love

37:27.333 --> 37:29.166
that is saying all this
is not saying it back.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.367
So, yeah, people should
probably know.

37:30.367 --> 37:32.033
- But he was, Jax!

37:32.033 --> 37:34.033
- Jax, what do you think
about Scheana's claim

37:34.033 --> 37:35.700
that you're threatened by Rob

37:35.700 --> 37:38.233
because he's taller
and more successful than you

37:38.233 --> 37:40.433
and better looking?
- Okay, cool.

37:40.433 --> 37:42.500
That's great.
How'd that work out for you?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.300
you, Jax.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.467
- You didn't even call me
when my father died.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.500
- You said sh--.
- Check your ----ing

37:49.500 --> 37:51.200
text messages.
you for saying that.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.600
I ----ing texted you
immediately.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
So  you
for saying that.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.500
- Can I please--can I just
have one minute, please?

38:01.500 --> 38:03.700
I just--I need a minute.
- Here we go.

38:03.700 --> 38:06.300
- I've never done this
but I need a minute.

38:13.400 --> 38:13.767
- Jax, what do you think

38:13.767 --> 38:14.266
- Jax, what do you think
about Scheana's claim

38:16.233 --> 38:18.367
that you're threatened by Rob
because he's taller

38:18.367 --> 38:20.667
and more successful.
- Okay, cool.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.500
That's great.
How'd that work out for you?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.266
you, Jax.

38:24.266 --> 38:26.400
- You didn't even call me
when my father died.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.333
- You said sh--.
- Check your ----ing

38:29.333 --> 38:31.100
text messages.
you for saying that.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.233
- I did immediately.
- And then you invite me,

38:33.233 --> 38:35.533
"Go--come to my Vegas show."
"Oh, why, 'cause you want me

38:35.533 --> 38:37.133
to see your show?
And see you perform?"

38:37.133 --> 38:38.500
- No, you're there,
"Do the carpet.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.066
I told people you
could do red carpet."

38:40.066 --> 38:41.367
Dude.
you for saying that.

38:41.367 --> 38:42.533
- She did text you
about your dad.

38:42.533 --> 38:43.667
- Can I just
have one minute, please?

38:43.667 --> 38:45.367
I need a minute.
I'm sorry.

38:45.367 --> 38:46.667
- Oh, here we go: victim.
- I've never done this

38:46.667 --> 38:48.133
but I need a minute.
- Go look.

38:48.133 --> 38:49.467
She did text you
about your dad.

38:49.467 --> 38:51.333
A text?
I had two ex-girlfriends

38:51.333 --> 38:53.233
and a girl who hated me
show up in Michigan

38:53.233 --> 38:54.667
without even asking.
- I hate you.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.433
- You can't even give me
a

38:56.433 --> 38:57.700
- Jax, she texted you.
you.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.300
What, oh, a text?
Ooh, you're supposed

38:59.300 --> 39:00.767
to be my friend over years?

39:00.767 --> 39:02.300
- My ex-girlfriend
of five years--

39:02.300 --> 39:03.700
who I've ruined
pretty much their lives.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.433
They showed up
without even asking.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.567
- Dude, enough with
the ----ing show for a second.

39:11.567 --> 39:14.166
My father died.
I needed my friends

39:14.166 --> 39:16.133
because I didn't
have anybody else.

39:16.133 --> 39:18.300
I sent her mom flowers because
it's sunny and it's pretty out.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.300
They showed up
without even asking.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.033
- Jax, I figure--
- I didn't ask you to ----ing

39:22.033 --> 39:24.033
- I think we all figured
you were very overwhelmed.

39:24.033 --> 39:26.033
She texted you.
- I can't walk in these shoes.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.567
- Dude, I had James
even reach out to me.

39:30.567 --> 39:32.300
Out of all people,
I had the people that hate me

39:32.300 --> 39:34.400
the most
show up to my house.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.700
- He's upset about his dad.
He's projecting it onto you.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.166
- I know.
But I--the second she texted me

39:39.166 --> 39:41.266
I immediately text him.
So, I'm sorry that I didn't

39:41.266 --> 39:43.033
actually dial your number.
- Of course.

39:43.033 --> 39:44.567
- I sent a message that you
could read over and over

39:44.567 --> 39:47.467
and over again, knowing
how ----ing sorry I was.

39:47.467 --> 39:49.200
- You hated me.
You despised me.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
My ex-girlfriend who I haven't
talked to in five years,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.066
Rachel, who hated me
more than life.

39:53.066 --> 39:54.433
- I'm giving you a hug.
I'm sorry--

39:54.433 --> 39:55.734
- Showed up to my house
in Michigan--

39:55.734 --> 39:57.300
- You are sad
about your dad right now.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.667
And you're misdirecting--
listen.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.300
- These are ex-girlfriends
who hate me.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.166
- You're misdirecting.
- Maybe you didn't know.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.066
You probably got
tons of text messages.

40:04.066 --> 40:05.600
- Okay, a text.
Wonderful, man.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.200
- Literally, Jax was
just in Vegas two weeks ago

40:08.200 --> 40:10.166
at ----ing Top Golf with me.
High as .

40:10.166 --> 40:11.333
Being like,
"Oh my God, I love you.

40:11.333 --> 40:12.567
This is so much fun."
Na na na.

40:12.567 --> 40:14.066
Like, and now, really?

40:14.066 --> 40:15.367
Two weeks later,
you're gonna act like--

40:15.367 --> 40:17.033
- Yeah.
Yeah.

40:17.033 --> 40:18.633
- And then she invited us
to her show in Vegas.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.066
First thing I get to the show.
Just right into her cell phone.

40:21.066 --> 40:22.734
"You didn't come to this.
There was a red carpet--"

40:22.734 --> 40:24.233
I'm like,
"It's not about you."

40:24.233 --> 40:25.700
- They had plans
to come see my show.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.367
And then he got tickets
to the Knights game

40:27.367 --> 40:29.066
And he goes, "You know
what a big opportunity

40:29.066 --> 40:30.367
this is for me."
Brittany's like, "You know,

40:30.367 --> 40:32.033
his dad, hockey."
And I go, "Absolutely.

40:32.033 --> 40:33.467
"I'm there for four months.
You can come see

40:33.467 --> 40:35.700
my show anytime."
- He's out there--

40:35.700 --> 40:37.633
I mean, he's still yelling.
you.

40:37.633 --> 40:40.767
You can't even keep a boyfriend
for more than five minutes.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.300
- Jax, we all understand--

40:42.300 --> 40:43.767
Jax, every single one of us
understands--

40:43.767 --> 40:45.467
- There's a lot--
okay, you're right.

40:45.467 --> 40:47.166
- why you're acting the way
you are right now.

40:47.166 --> 40:48.600
- Well, I'm gonna go
back out there.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.100
You come out there
when you're ready.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.633
Your makeup is gonna look
----ing fantastic.

40:52.633 --> 40:54.367
- How hard is it
to call somebody, "Hey, man,

40:54.367 --> 40:56.300
"Are you okay?
I know this is tough for you.

40:56.300 --> 40:59.266
I know this is tough for you."
- Oh my God, he's yelling so--

40:59.266 --> 41:01.600
I'm not even there.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.633
- I'm close with her family.
I go over to her house.

41:03.633 --> 41:05.467
I sent her mother flowers.
That and that.

41:05.467 --> 41:07.266
All I get is a text?

41:07.266 --> 41:09.600
- She's coming back.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.100
Her...

41:11.100 --> 41:13.000
tears, well...
her lashes came off.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.500
- Oh.
Her makeup.

41:16.133 --> 41:17.633
- Nice.

41:17.633 --> 41:19.500
- Sh--, I got more from
people I don't even know.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.200
"Hope you're okay."

41:21.200 --> 41:23.000
- Sorry, they just keep
coming out.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.467
- You're all right.
It's okay.

41:24.467 --> 41:27.333
- She just told me in there
that two weeks ago

41:27.333 --> 41:29.367
you guys were together in Vegas
and you were talking about

41:29.367 --> 41:30.734
how much fun you were having.
And how much you loved her.

41:30.734 --> 41:32.333
- Brittany can vouch for me.
What was I doing?

41:32.333 --> 41:34.000
I was like this on the couch
the whole time.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.400
And I said this,
"She hasn't asked me once

41:35.400 --> 41:37.367
about my dad."
Not once.

41:37.367 --> 41:39.033
Not once.
"Did you see my show?

41:39.033 --> 41:41.033
"Did you see the red carpet?"
No, Scheana, I didn't

41:41.033 --> 41:42.767
see your show, I'm sorry."
- She also said she texted you

41:42.767 --> 41:44.633
numerous times about it.
- "There's a red carpet,

41:44.633 --> 41:46.500
"and I have to be there,
and I told people that

41:46.500 --> 41:48.367
I need to do pictures."
And I'm like, "Dude."

41:48.367 --> 41:50.567
There's a 9:00 to 5:00.
You gotta turn it off at 5:00.

41:50.567 --> 41:52.567
- We'll take you back.
As soon as you can.

41:52.567 --> 41:55.166
- I'm really trying.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.367
- Once in a while be
a human being and not be a--

41:57.367 --> 41:59.567
"I'm on a TV show."
All the damn time.

41:59.567 --> 42:01.266
.
Dude, turn it off.

42:01.266 --> 42:02.767
You're a human being.
- Just listen to me.

42:02.767 --> 42:04.500
- She wants--
- Maybe that's why

42:04.500 --> 42:06.400
half her relationships
are gone down the sh--ter.

42:10.633 --> 42:13.767
- Why is this like harder
than my divorce.

42:13.767 --> 42:15.433
- Next week it's Part Two

42:15.433 --> 42:17.400
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.367
- I wasn't like, "Brittany, if
you and Jax are together today,

42:19.367 --> 42:21.333
I want you to cheat on him."

42:21.333 --> 42:23.467
- Wait, but you said on camera,
"If he's gonna  with

42:23.467 --> 42:26.066
my relationship, then I'm
gonna  with his."

42:26.066 --> 42:28.200
- Billie Lee.
- Actually, I looked at porn

42:28.200 --> 42:30.333
so I could say what vagina
looks really nice.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.266
- Well, those vaginas
are edited.

42:32.266 --> 42:34.333
- Well, I wanted an edited,
pretty vagina.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.667
- Katie was--for a long time

42:36.667 --> 42:38.066
she was a nightmare
of a human being.

42:39.467 --> 42:41.467
- Why did you think Stassi
was ignorant?

42:41.467 --> 42:44.200
You said someone should school
her white-privileged ass.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.467
- Yeah.

42:45.467 --> 42:47.066
- Sorry again.
- It's not about being--

42:47.066 --> 42:48.533
- Oh, right.
But then I do it again.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.433
So where the
do you want me to go from here?

42:50.433 --> 42:52.033
- Stop doing it!
- There's nowhere to go.

42:52.033 --> 42:53.467
- It's really simple!

42:53.467 --> 42:55.600
- Ariana, you said
that you were 100% sure

42:55.600 --> 42:58.300
Jax had slept with Faith
multiple times.

42:58.300 --> 43:01.200
- Mm-hmm.

43:02.367 --> 43:04.200
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules"

43:04.200 --> 43:05.767
