- Yeah.

Ship ahoy, girls.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.128
Listen to him.
Listen to him.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.599
He takes one stupid class
a week,

01:41.702 --> 01:44.694
and he thinks he's Popeye.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.663

Oh, hi, Lori Beth.

(Richie chuckles)

01:51.845 --> 01:53.779
My girl. (laughs)

01:54.848 --> 01:58.148
Hey, Rich,
you know Cynthia Holmes?

01:58.251 --> 02:01.016
She invited us
to her cousin's dinner party

02:01.121 --> 02:02.987
at the yacht club
Saturday night.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.580
Hey, no kidding?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.716
You must be getting pretty
buddy-buddy with her, huh?

02:06.827 --> 02:09.693
Not really, but she doesn't have
too many friends at school.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.396
LORI BETH:
Cynthia. Hi. Over here.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.800
Hi, Lori Beth.
Hi, Richie.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.098
Hi, Cynthia.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.971
Hey, Cynthia,
you know, me and Pots

02:23.076 --> 02:25.238
aren't doing anything
Saturday night.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.008
Oh. Have you considered the USO?

02:28.115 --> 02:30.242
Hey, great idea!

02:30.350 --> 02:31.681
The USO?

02:31.785 --> 02:35.278
Yeah, Pots. I hear they got
girls down there that volunteer.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.084
For what?

02:37.190 --> 02:40.422
They help comfort lonely Gls.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.586
I'm lonely, I'm lonely.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.030
RALPH:
Me, too. I need comforting.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.828
(Lori Beth laughs)

02:49.036 --> 02:51.698
Don't you just love
men in uniform?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.569

I'm gonna call
an ambulance for her.

nothing wrong with her.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.770
Nothing wrong?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.850
Well, Fonz, I just don't think
that she understands, uh...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.884
"Be there."

04:11.985 --> 04:14.977
Let me ask you a question: What
is that Cynthia woman's story?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.990
Well... she comes from
a very wealthy family.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.958
Grew up in an all-girls
school... you know.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.052
Oh, you mean class, society,
stuff like that.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.323
Right.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.729
So if I were you,
I would just, uh,

04:26.833 --> 04:28.802
you know, be a little crafty.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.166
Try a... subtle approach.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.170
Subtle.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.501
I can handle that.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.473
Just takes a little while
longer, that's all.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.908
- Sure, just give it a few days.
- Days?

04:38.011 --> 04:40.309
I'm talking minutes.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.882
Richie's friend is cute.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.314
Fonzie? Yeah.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.783
Cynthia Holmes,

04:45.886 --> 04:48.150
I'd like to introduce you
to Arthur Fonzarelli.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.155
He likes to be called Fonzie.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.418
Fonzie. How quaint.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.394
Quaint back.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.558
Very nice.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.499
And I do mean... nice.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.934
May I?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.368
Certainly.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.769
Minutes.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.742
Now, um, Cynthia, Richie told me
that you spent so much time

05:12.846 --> 05:15.144
in girls' schools,
I figured you missed out

05:15.248 --> 05:18.844
on a lot of good years,
so why don't you and I

05:18.952 --> 05:21.751
just go up
to Inspiration Point together.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.845
Oh, my-

05:22.956 --> 05:24.481
What I mean is that, you know,

05:24.591 --> 05:28.152
Inspiration Point is, like,
one, a very historical site.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.663
So many conquests have...

05:32.699 --> 05:34.463
(laughs):
Conquests?

05:34.568 --> 05:35.865
Oh, history.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.198
Oh, I love history.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.033
It's so exhilarating.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.402
Exhilarating.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.667
Exactly.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.504
See that?
She gets my drift.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.442
Look, why don't
you and Lori Beth

05:45.545 --> 05:49.243
take a walk
while we make history?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.010
Well, sure, Fonz.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.881
Eh, come on, Lori Beth,

05:52.986 --> 05:55.284
let's go shoot some baskets.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.618
He's so romantic.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.451
How'd you like to get historic
right here in the booth?

06:03.496 --> 06:06.489
Oh, Cynthia, do come along.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.129
The cocktail guests are waiting.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.104
I don't mind picking you up
in this... place,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.175
but, uh, must you make me wait?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.175
It's my cousin Millard.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.643
I'm afraid
I really do have to run.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.545
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, Mill...

06:22.649 --> 06:24.344
you gotta hold on here,

06:24.451 --> 06:27.079
'cause I'm having a convo
with your cuz.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.814
Convo?

06:28.922 --> 06:32.415
Oh, Millard, I'd like you
to meet Arthur Fonzarelli.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.585
He likes to be called Fonzie.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.026
Hey.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.255
Fonzie...?

06:37.364 --> 06:38.661
Yes, you know,

06:38.765 --> 06:41.757
the way you like
to be called Skippy.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.004
Skippy...!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.638
Yes. How do you do?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.272
- I do great.
-(chuckles)

06:57.317 --> 06:59.251
Perhaps.
But confidentially,

06:59.352 --> 07:01.548
one could never tell
from your appearance.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.748
- Hey, you want to chase this
to the door? -Oh, no, no.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.586
Don't be embarrassed.
It's just that Mother

07:05.692 --> 07:08.127
collects clothing for charity,
and since most of it

07:08.228 --> 07:11.061
is nicer than you have, perhaps
you could find something decent.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.600
Well, no, since Mummy, uh...

07:14.701 --> 07:17.864
dresses you, I think
I'll stick with what I got on.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.302
Are you making fun of Mummy?

07:19.406 --> 07:21.397
Millard...

07:21.508 --> 07:23.499
please don't be mean to Fonzie.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.737
We're going to a historical
landmark together.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.745
Pick me up on Tuesday.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.008
Tuesday!

07:29.115 --> 07:31.015
-(snaps fingers)
- I can't. I'm all booked.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.279
- Well, cancel it.
- No, no, you don't understand.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.615
See, Beatrice, Rachel and Ellen

07:34.721 --> 07:36.849
have been waiting
for six months on a list.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.219
Three girls at once?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.519
Well, that's
just on the weekends.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.958
Tuesdays they work in shifts.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.188
Now, listen, sweet lips,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.697
I got to get back
to the garage, all right?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.960
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.797
Listen, why don't you
get my phone number

07:49.903 --> 07:51.063
from the bathroom wall--

07:51.171 --> 07:54.106
maybe there's gonna be
a cancellation, huh?

07:54.207 --> 07:56.335
Whoa!

07:56.443 --> 07:58.434
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:05.552 --> 08:06.849
Garage?!

08:06.953 --> 08:09.013
You were going out
with a lowly mechanic?

08:09.122 --> 08:12.683
Worse-- I've just been
turned down by a lowly mechanic.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.192
Mm. Want to get even?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.194
We'll invite him
to my party at the club.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.559
Oh, Skippy.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.996
No, no, no, amongst
the commodore and his friends,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.728
this Fonzie will look like
a court jester... (chuckles)

08:22.836 --> 08:28.240
Oh, Skippy,
what a wonderful idea.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.901
You know, it really
could be quite amusing.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.477
Oh, too, too amusing.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.773
(chuckles)

08:36.383 --> 08:38.374
(mouthing)

08:40.587 --> 08:43.147
<i>RICHIE:
Well, that's what Alfred said.</i>

08:43.256 --> 08:45.748
Imagine, trying
to humiliate him like that.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.591
Richard, you've got
to tell Arthur not to go.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.597
Well... Al and I
didn't really have the heart.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.030
Well, look, you're an adult--

08:54.134 --> 08:56.227
just come out
and tell him the truth.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.168
I think you're right. That's
what I'm gonna have to do.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.002
Yeah, and when you're in the
hospital, can I have your room?

09:02.976 --> 09:05.877
Hey, listen, I'm very sorry
for the interruption right here,

09:05.979 --> 09:09.608
but I want to show you
a flash of class. Look at that.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.583
That's my first invitation
from Cynthia.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.711
Raised letters,
and it ain't even a wedding.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.186
Can you dig that?

09:16.289 --> 09:17.916
Yes, Richard got one, too.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.049
We-we rubbed it before.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.492
Yeah. But the thing is, dig it,

09:22.595 --> 09:25.690
this is my first RSVP.

09:25.799 --> 09:29.599
Usually I just get,
you know, "Stag" or "Drag."

09:29.702 --> 09:32.467
- Oh, Arthur...
- Yeah?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.131
Richard.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.402
- Howard...
- Marion...

09:36.509 --> 09:39.001
I think maybe
you better leave us men alone

09:39.112 --> 09:40.545
for a few minutes, huh?

09:40.647 --> 09:43.582
Yes. Come on, Joanie,
let's, uh, defrost the roast.

09:43.683 --> 09:47.984
- Oh, I miss all the fireworks.
- You're catching on.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.056
What are we gonna do,
tell dirty jokes?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.525
Fonz, look, about this party...

09:53.626 --> 09:55.526
- Yeah.
- I think it's gonna be boring.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.291
I'd much rather go
to the stock car races with you.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.525
I mean, it's great--
(imitate tires skidding)

10:00.633 --> 10:02.101
Skidding through turns.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.601
(imitates crashing)

10:03.703 --> 10:04.693
Wipeout!

10:04.804 --> 10:06.363
You know, that's my kind of fun.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.600
You don't have
to beat around the bush with me;

10:08.708 --> 10:09.675
I get your drift.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.471
- Oh, you do?
- Sure.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.671
This is gonna be a different
type of party for you.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.610
You're gonna be lonely.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.705
I'll take care of you-- promise.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.051
Dad?
(clears throat softly)

10:22.088 --> 10:24.751
(sighs)
Uh...

10:24.858 --> 10:27.884
Fonzie,
when-when-when I was a kid,

10:27.994 --> 10:30.588
uh, my father used
to tag along with me

10:30.697 --> 10:32.187
at all the school dances.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.996
Now, he was a nice guy,
but he just didn't fit in.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.696
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

10:38.805 --> 10:39.863
Sure.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.270
And I hope that, one day,

10:41.374 --> 10:45.334
you can sit down with your pop
and have a long talk.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.637
Richard...

10:50.517 --> 10:52.246
Fonzie, don't go to the party.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.683
They only invited you there

10:53.786 --> 10:55.118
'cause they want
to make fun of you.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.959
They want to make fun of me?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.528
Who wants to make fun of me?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.258
Cynthia and-and Millard.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.526
No, no, not Cynthia.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.534
Cynthia, she sent me
this invitation,

11:09.636 --> 11:11.103
with raised letters
and everything, man.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.569
She likes me.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.663
I mean, you know, Millard,
he's not one

11:14.774 --> 11:17.107
of my favorite people
in the whole world-- so what?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.269
Hey, I'll tell you something,
I'll tell you something,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.472
I'll just watch my P's and Q's,
that's all.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.209
You know,
like they say in society...

11:24.317 --> 11:26.149
ta-ta.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.178
Heyyy!

11:34.027 --> 11:36.518
Well, you didn't exactly
talk him out of it.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.722
Mm.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.924
It looks like
Arthur's going to dinner.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.762
Not only is he going to dinner,

11:41.868 --> 11:44.530
it looks like he's going
to be the main course.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.639
<i>AL: Better hurry up, Fonz.
It's getting late.</i>

11:56.000 --> 12:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:05.725 --> 12:07.716
Oh, Fonz, you look great!

12:07.827 --> 12:11.024
- Perfect fit.
- Bellissimo!

12:11.130 --> 12:13.292
With four arms?

12:17.036 --> 12:18.766
Four arms!

12:18.871 --> 12:20.863
You only gave me
two dollars for it.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.238
I got it off of Ollie
the Human Octopus

12:23.343 --> 12:24.776
at the circus sideshow.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.847
Ollie's a phony?

12:27.947 --> 12:30.314
I shook hands with him.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.614
Now, look...

12:32.719 --> 12:35.449
I'm gonna wear
my leather jacket.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.853
It's proper for any occasion.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.290
Get out of here.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.384
Sorry, Fonz, I tried.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.227
Hey, wait a minute...

12:45.331 --> 12:48.096
maybe I could sell it
to Ralph and Potsie.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.670
(seabirds squawk in distance)

12:55.775 --> 12:57.766
(piano playing lively jazz)

13:05.284 --> 13:07.617
(blows bosun's whistle)

13:08.621 --> 13:10.919
Piping aboard.

13:11.024 --> 13:15.017
Miss Lori Beth Allen
and Richard Cunningham.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.097
- How do you do?
- How do you do? How do you do?

13:23.102 --> 13:26.038
(blows whistle)

13:26.139 --> 13:28.539
Piping aboard.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.042
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.245
I don't see Fonzie;
I wonder if he's coming.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.647
Oh, no, no, he's coming.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.048
I... I saw the Polanski twins

13:40.153 --> 13:42.781
pumping air
into his motorcycle tires.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.225
(Fonzie whistles)

13:48.328 --> 13:49.317
All right.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.487
Now, hear this:

13:50.596 --> 13:53.589
The Fonz is here--
let the frolics begin.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.034
How do? How do? How do?

13:58.137 --> 14:00.106
How do? How do?

14:00.206 --> 14:02.197
How do you do?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.617
Excuse me, Cynthia,
I just want to show Fonzie

14:12.719 --> 14:14.243
the great view of Lake Michigan.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.651
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

14:15.755 --> 14:18.087
I wanted to introduce Fonzie
to some of our friends.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.091
This is the Commodore.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.024
Oh, uh, how do you do?

14:22.128 --> 14:23.721
He's a little deaf.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.798
Come, Fonzie, I want you
to meet some more people.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.458
- RICHIE: Uh, no!
- FONZIE: See ya, see ya, see ya.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.832
How do? How do? How do?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.734
Hey. Nice to see ya.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.136
All right, ship ahoy.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.445
So glad you could come.
(chuckles)

14:40.546 --> 14:43.209
A leather blazer-- how gauche.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.512
Good. How gauche it with you?

14:46.919 --> 14:48.819
Hey, eats! All right!

14:48.921 --> 14:51.857
I never heard caviar
referred to as "eats."

14:51.958 --> 14:53.391
Caviar?

14:53.493 --> 14:55.586
Yes, sir, they're
little fish eggs.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.492
It's imported. Eat up.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.088
Imported little fish eggs.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.099
How quaint.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.431
I had 'em for lunch;
thanks very much, anyway.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.165
Juanita,
that will be enough out of you.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.298
Wait a minute,
she's just being friendly.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.138
We don't hire servants
to be friendly.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.541
We hire them to work.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.080
(bosun's whistle blows)

15:15.181 --> 15:17.081
Dinner is served.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.708
Hey, uh, Juanita...

15:18.818 --> 15:21.480
thanks a lot for the tip
on the little fishies, huh?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.078
- Heyyy.
- Come, Millard.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.282
Uh, yes, come along,
Mr. Fonzarelli.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.054
Dinner is ready.
hurry along, now.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.526
Chow, chow.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.222
(chuckles):
"Chow, chow."

15:31.330 --> 15:33.560
Hey, I love Chinese food.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.373
I want to tell you something,
I really like that soup.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.138
- What is it?
- Vichyssoise.

15:46.245 --> 15:49.442
Oh, it tasted
like potatoes to me.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.643
- It is potato.
- I knew the soup.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.686
I knew the soup!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.915
I know my veggies.
(chuckles)

15:59.325 --> 16:02.056
Perhaps Mr. Fonzarelli
would like to choose

16:02.161 --> 16:03.993
the next bottle of wine.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.156
- I'll do it! -I'll do it!
- CYNTHIA: No, no...

16:06.265 --> 16:08.256
let Fonzie do it.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.631
Perhaps a hint.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.470
We're having lobster.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.567
Flown in from Maine, of course.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.475
Of course. I wouldn't
want those little guys

16:20.580 --> 16:22.070
to walk here all by themselves.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.252
We have an excellent
wine cellar here.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.153
Perhaps a Mouton Cadet,
a Pinot Chardonnay

16:31.257 --> 16:33.658
or a, uh,
a Chateauneuf-du-Pape?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.861
What's your choice?

16:37.964 --> 16:39.557
Number 11.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.332
A Pouilly Fuissé, uh, 1949.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.563
An excellent choice, sir.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.038
He got the wine!
Fonz, you got the wine!

16:48.140 --> 16:50.302
I got the wine.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.070
(whispering)

16:55.181 --> 16:56.740
Yes, uh, an excellent choice.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.818
Don't you think so, Sappy?

17:01.387 --> 17:03.287
That's Skippy.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.050
Of course.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.926
Millard, he is making
a sap out of you.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.156
The evening isn't over yet.

17:16.801 --> 17:17.791
Pardon me.

17:17.904 --> 17:18.893
(inhales)

17:19.005 --> 17:21.132
It is customary
at these occasions

17:21.240 --> 17:24.938
to have one of the guests
offer a toast to the ladies.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.273
I think it would be
most appropriate

17:27.380 --> 17:31.976
for Mr. Fonzarelli to do
the honors-- don't you think so?

17:40.660 --> 17:44.494
Uh, a toast
to the ladies at my table.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.191
I think you remind me...

17:47.300 --> 17:49.825
of a bouquet.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.837
Lovely, lovely flowers...

17:56.275 --> 17:58.505
...with great stems!

18:00.246 --> 18:02.578
(guests clinking glasses)

18:08.621 --> 18:11.181
Juanita, I won't have a servant
mingling with the guests!

18:11.290 --> 18:13.315
Hey, hold it, she ain't
mingling, she's laughing.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.020
Juanita, I warned you before--
now, get out, you're fired.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.256
-(Fonzie snaps fingers)
- Hold it! Get back here!

18:18.364 --> 18:21.265
Oh, man, there's
gonna be trouble.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.392
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, I'm cool.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.062
I just have a few words here
to say to Skippy.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.007
Now, uh, Skip-face...

18:30.109 --> 18:32.544
ever since I got here
to this little get-together,

18:32.645 --> 18:34.078
you've been pushing me
around, see?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.409
That's okay. I'm cool.

18:35.514 --> 18:36.846
I can take care of myself.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.852
When you start pushing little
ladies around, you gone too far.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.513
- CYNTHIA: He's right.
-(Millard huffs)

18:43.623 --> 18:45.557
After all, who'll serve dinner?

18:45.658 --> 18:47.717
(low, indistinct chatter)

18:49.795 --> 18:51.695
"Who'll serve dinner?"

18:51.797 --> 18:53.561
That's what
you're worried about?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.566
Who will serve dinner?

18:55.668 --> 19:00.196
Boy, did you turn out to be
a disappointment, Cynth.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.037
All right, all right,
who is gonna serve dinner, then?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.941
Oh, let me say...

19:06.045 --> 19:08.207
permit me.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.547
Millard...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.643
some lobster.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.987
Let me tell you something.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.498
Don't you ever
call me for a date.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.762
I only date chicks with class.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.269
Well, I never!

19:32.371 --> 19:34.431
Well, honey,
maybe that's your problem.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.840
Hey!

19:41.847 --> 19:45.306
Somebody help me--
I have a lobster on my lap.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.046
Ooh, that Fonzie
is such a common person.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.985
Positively gross.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.617
Okay, buddy, that's it!

19:53.726 --> 19:56.422
You and Cynthia have been
needling Fonzie all night.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.224
You got what you deserved.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.798
You're-you're crude

19:59.899 --> 20:02.163
and-and you're boring and...

20:02.268 --> 20:03.531
- Rotten!
- Right!

20:03.636 --> 20:05.934
- You're not a nice person.
- What makes you think

20:06.038 --> 20:07.802
you're better than my friend
Arthur Fonzarelli?

20:07.907 --> 20:10.137
Maybe he doesn't have
white pants and a blue blazer,

20:10.242 --> 20:11.733
but I'll tell you
one thing, buddy,

20:11.844 --> 20:13.243
he's got something
you'll never have--

20:13.345 --> 20:14.438
he's got class!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.481
Yeah, that's right,
I said class.

20:16.582 --> 20:19.142
- Let's get out of here.
- MILLARD: Yes, steward,

20:19.251 --> 20:21.151
show this common trash
to the door.

20:21.253 --> 20:24.314
Common trash?

20:24.423 --> 20:26.118
Oh, excuse me.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.685
I'm sorry, but you've just seen
common trash pushed too far.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.867
You're forgetting one thing

20:35.968 --> 20:38.733
that goes very well
with lobster--

20:38.838 --> 20:40.772
melted butter.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.864

Hi, Fonz.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.199
<i>II</i>

21:12.304 --> 21:13.271
(music stops)

21:13.372 --> 21:14.931
Hey, Rich.
Listen, uh, girls,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.874
I would like to talk to Rich
on the QT, all right?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.241
(laughs)
Let's powder our noses.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.678
They want to be alone.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.446
You know,
about that Cynthia girl,

21:27.553 --> 21:29.453
you were absolutely right.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.251
I let a beautiful girl
fog my brain.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.827
Well, it happens
to the best of us.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.691
Yeah, but what
I really want to say is

21:36.796 --> 21:39.629
that I am very, uh, s... s...

21:42.001 --> 21:44.936
Richie, I am sincerely...

21:45.037 --> 21:47.131
S... S... S...

21:47.239 --> 21:50.038
Fonz, you don't have
to say you're sorry.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.135
Good. I won't.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.179
But, uh...
I didn't do too good there,

21:55.281 --> 21:58.250
and they probably tossed you out
on my account; I know that.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.317
You kidding?

21:59.418 --> 22:00.818
Think I was gonna
stick around there

22:00.920 --> 22:02.683
after what they did to you?

22:02.788 --> 22:05.382
Are you telling me
that you left on your own?

22:05.491 --> 22:09.928
Yeah. Uh, after I corrected
the one small mistake you made.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.623
You never serve lobster
in a man's lap...

22:12.731 --> 22:14.427
without melted butter.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.002
You did that?

22:17.102 --> 22:18.536
- Yeah.
- You did that?

22:18.637 --> 22:20.105
(laughs):
The whole pitcher.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.571
Well, you know,
it goes together.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.801
Yeah. I'll tell you something,
like you and me,

22:23.909 --> 22:26.310
we go together like lobster
and melted butter, right?

22:26.412 --> 22:29.074
Right, right. Like, uh,
peanut butter and jelly.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.672
(laughs):
Yeah, right.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.580
I hate peanut butter and jelly.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.455
But I know exactly
what you mean.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.047
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.752
So I just want to say thanks,
and I'm thinking

22:41.861 --> 22:44.125
maybe we could have
our own little party, huh?

22:44.230 --> 22:45.458
That's a great idea.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.089
How about
a little, uh, music, maestro?

22:47.199 --> 22:49.190
-(snaps fingers)
- Right.

Oh, Fonzie,
I read all about you.

I'm much better in person.
