00:11.678 --> 00:12.512
Emma?

00:13.513 --> 00:14.431
Hi, Mommy.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.727
You know you're not supposed to swim
unless one of us is out here with you.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.858
You okay?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.234
Yep.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.573
Emma was swimming by herself.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.367
Relax. We're right here.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.869
We weren't right here.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.497
Well, you're the one
who can't swim, Meredith.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.623
She's fine.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.128
-Okay. Who wants to go fishing?
-Me.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.921
-Okay--
-Just careful of the hook.

00:47.005 --> 00:50.508
-You are so fucking controlling.
-Can you not do this in front of her?

00:51.301 --> 00:54.471
Okay. Emma, hey,
why don't you run back up to the house,

00:54.554 --> 00:56.097
get Daddy another beer. Yeah?

00:57.515 --> 00:58.933
Neil, you've had enough.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.685
Go on, Emma.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.691
Are you kidding me?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.860
You second-guess every thing
I say or do with that kid.

01:08.943 --> 01:12.280
God, you are scared of the world.
That is going to fuck up our kid.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.741
-Stop swearing.
-Oh, sorry.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.161
What, you're afraid of words now too, huh?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.872
Neil, your temper is out of control.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.832
-Oh, relax. Fucking hell.
-It is.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.419
Do you wanna see out of control?

01:32.425 --> 01:34.552
'Cause I can fucking show you
out of control.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.595
You're scaring me.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.305
Oops. Ah!

01:38.598 --> 01:40.058
-Damn it.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.434
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck this.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.774
Neil! Neil!

01:59.577 --> 02:00.912
-Ah.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.885
How could I have been so wrong about him?

02:20.723 --> 02:22.851
<i>Local Middlebury man,</i>
<i>Neil Coleman,</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:24.519
<i>is no longer a person of interest</i>

02:24.602 --> 02:26.980
<i>in the death of his wife,</i>
<i>Meredith Coleman,</i>

02:27.063 --> 02:30.441
<i>whose drowning has shocked and saddened</i>
<i>this tight-knit community.</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:32.777
<i>Coleman maintained</i>
<i>his innocence throughout.</i>

02:32.861 --> 02:33.987
Of course you did.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.074
<i> And today, officials determined</i>
<i>the death was consistent with an accident.</i>

02:38.158 --> 02:38.992


02:42.036 --> 02:44.539
You fucking think
you got away with it, don't you?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.883
"Meredith Coleman, loving wife and mother,

02:54.966 --> 02:59.137
survived by her husband, Neil,
her daughter, Emma, and sister,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.057
Hillary Lathan, a resident of Middlebury."

03:05.226 --> 03:06.102
Bingo.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.231
I bet you know something, Hillary.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.484
So how do I find you?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.623
"Dog lover, morning gardener,

03:27.207 --> 03:28.875
Middlebury proud."

03:30.418 --> 03:31.294
Bingo.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.937
"395 Little Harbor Road, Middlebury."

03:52.523 --> 03:53.399
Bingo.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.501
-I found the body, Miss Anna.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.170
What?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.131
-I found him in the bushes.
-Oh.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.300
I'm guessing after he fell,

04:19.384 --> 04:21.886
he staggered over there before he passed.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.805
He smells pretty loud, doesn't he?

04:23.888 --> 04:26.724
Yeah. Yes, Buell, he does.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.642
Yeah.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.436
Well, mystery solved.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.738
-Hey.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.448
Ay!

04:42.532 --> 04:45.827
-I so did not mean to scare you.
-What are you doing here?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.496
Well, I wanted to see
how the support group went.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.081
And I was going to text you,

04:50.164 --> 04:52.625
but then I was like,
that's not something you text.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.253
And so, of course,
I'm… I'm… I'm dropping by,

04:55.336 --> 04:59.465
which I did promise
that I would not do anymore.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.718
I probably should have called you.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.303
Um, where are you going?

05:04.470 --> 05:08.182
Um, I'm…
To another support group, actually.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.560
-Yeah. There's one starting in…
-Oh.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.437
Oh gosh, it's like right now.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.024
Do you want me to come with you?
Or is that not allowed?

05:16.524 --> 05:21.821
Um, no. That… It's not allowed.
They were really clear about that.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.032
They said
just it's not allowed. No guests.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.410
Of course, totally.
Yeah. That… that makes a lot of sense.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.620
Okay. Well, have fun.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.830
No…

05:31.414 --> 05:35.626
Not fun. I know this is not fun,
because you're doing the work.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.880
And I support it,

05:38.963 --> 05:43.259
and I support you
going to the support group. So…

05:43.968 --> 05:45.678
-Thanks, Sloane.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.596
Yep.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.163
Can I help you?

06:12.246 --> 06:15.625
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.
Are you Meredith Coleman's sister?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.628
I'm s… sorry. Who… who are you?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.670
I'm Anna.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.256
Uh, I was a friend of Meredith's.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.719
She took, like, pottery classes forever.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.513
From pottery class.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.062
Yeah. Come on in.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.611
I hope you like casserole.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.824
I love casserole.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.576
Look how pretty she was.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.494
Aw.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.414
Emma looks so much like her.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.541
I think so too.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.001
Everyone used to say
she looked like Neil, but

07:00.253 --> 07:01.087
I never saw it.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.215
Are you close with Neil?

07:04.298 --> 07:06.426
I mean, I don't really know him that well.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.302
I am not close with Neil.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.975
This could be
none of my business, but, um,

07:14.517 --> 07:17.812
sometimes in pottery class,

07:17.895 --> 07:20.565
Meredith used to complain
about Neil's temper.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.443
Did you ever see that side of him?

07:23.526 --> 07:28.030
Never saw a temper, but…
…I wouldn't be surprised if he had one.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.533
I never trusted him.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.536
I think he was cheating on Meredith.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.537
Really?

07:35.037 --> 07:37.248
I mean, come on.
A guy who looks like that,

07:37.331 --> 07:40.334
you think he wants to spend
Saturday night changing diapers?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.173
The only one I care about is Emma.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.217
I haven't seen her
since they left Middlebury.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.554
Obviously doesn't want Emma
to have a relationship with me.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.767
Little girl's been through
so much.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.728
Yeah.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.856
Such a tragedy to lose your mother.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.525
Not just that tragedy.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.778
You know, the tragedy after that tragedy.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.156
There was another tragedy?

08:10.823 --> 08:13.201
Emma's teacher at St. Phillip's,

08:14.535 --> 08:17.788
she died weeks after Meredith.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.167
I'm sorry.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.839
I don't think I can do this anymore.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.382
Of course. Yes.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.634
-Um, well…

08:31.469 --> 08:33.638
Thank you s… so much for your time.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.558
Wait.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.270
Your casserole.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.326
Can I help you?

08:55.409 --> 08:56.452
Yes, hi.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.580
Um, my husband and I are considering
moving to Middlebury.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.706
Oh, how nice.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.502
And, um, we have, uh, a son
who's in the third grade,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.588
and I just had a… a few questions
about St. Phillip's.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.298
Uh, mostly safety concerns.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.094
Of course. The safety
of our students is our utmost priority.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.431
It's just I had heard about a…

09:19.433 --> 09:22.311
tragedy involving one of the teachers?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.813
Ms. Patrick. Yes.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.524
That was just awful.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.693
May I ask what happened?

09:28.776 --> 09:31.904
Well, they were on a class field trip
to the lighthouse…

09:32.947 --> 09:35.199
Her mom used to chaperone
all the field trips,

09:35.283 --> 09:36.659
so now I try and make sure I do it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.580
So, what happened to Ms. Patrick?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.959
Somehow, poor thing, she…

09:46.043 --> 09:47.169
she fell.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.589
Oh God.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.632
My stomach hurts.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.676
Did you go to the nurse?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.762
-She said I was lying.
-Are you lying?

09:57.346 --> 09:58.514
I don't know.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.391
What do you mean you don't know?

10:00.975 --> 10:02.476
It hurts sometimes.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.270
Does it hurt right now?

10:04.854 --> 10:05.688
I don't know.

10:05.771 --> 10:10.484
Sorry, uh, by chance, on that field trip,
was Neil Coleman a chaperone?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.153
It did one time before.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.947
Wait. How do you know Mr. Coleman?

10:16.782 --> 10:17.658
Uh--

10:17.742 --> 10:19.118
Who did you say you were again?

10:19.785 --> 10:20.786
Can I have one?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.496
No, uh…

10:22.580 --> 10:23.789
I, uh…

11:05.247 --> 11:06.332
-Careful.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.086
You don't wanna fall into the sea.

11:12.046 --> 11:12.880
Thank you.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.675
Um, do you work here?

11:16.258 --> 11:17.301
All my life.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.970
So you were here
the day that teacher died.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.389
I was. Yes.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.015
Horrible business.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.059
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.353
Are you a reporter?

11:28.729 --> 11:29.563
Yes.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.565
Then why aren't you recording this?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.366
So, do you happen to remember--

11:40.449 --> 11:44.870
My name is Wallace Falkner,
and I am the lighthouse operator.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.081
Um,

11:48.541 --> 11:50.918
getting back to the day
that the teacher died…

11:51.001 --> 11:52.086
Hmm.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.965
…do you happen to remember if
there was a chaperone here with the class?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.926
We get so many schools
that come through and visit,

11:59.009 --> 12:01.470
I couldn't possibly remember
something like that. No.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.473
Uh, okay.

12:04.974 --> 12:05.933
Um…

12:06.016 --> 12:07.351
…thank you for your time.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.562
Wait.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.399
When will this air?

12:16.026 --> 12:16.861
Soon.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.156
Probably t… tonight.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.202
This nice lady's gonna take our picture.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.203
Gather around.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.998
Okay, kids. Hold it.

12:30.124 --> 12:30.958
Got it.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.043
All right. The bus leaves in 15 minutes.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.380
Excuse me.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
Yeah?

12:38.090 --> 12:40.843
Do you take a picture of every class
that comes through here?

12:41.385 --> 12:44.430
I do.
I send it to the school as a souvenir.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.265
Do you keep a copy for yourself?

12:46.348 --> 12:47.183
No.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.643
Thank you for your time.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.897
I keep the negatives.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.651
This was the Grovenor's School for Boys.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.446
Guess she wouldn't be in this one.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.449
Can we just do one more?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.701
I'm tired. It's getting late.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.619
Please.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.038
It's very important.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.211
-Here we go.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.339
That's her.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.257
This is the one.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.224
<i>Hold it.</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:31.727
-Got it.
-All right, kids. Bus leaves at 2:00.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.270
You can run around till then.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.278
Do you wanna go somewhere
a little more private?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.905
-Yeah.
-Come on.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.168
-Hey.
-Yes?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.420
You can tell me
if this is too soon for you.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.297
What?

14:01.507 --> 14:04.343
-Because of your wife.
-Oh no, don't worry about that.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.680
Oh! I can't help it. She just died.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.974
I thought you wanted us to be together.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.352
-I do.
-Well, this makes that easier.

14:13.894 --> 14:14.854
Doesn't it?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.484
Wait. Did you have something
to do with Meredith's death?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.320
Uh…

14:25.239 --> 14:27.658
No, no, no. D… don't touch me.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.785
Well, where are you going?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.538
To the police.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.540
-No, you're not.
-No!

14:43.215 --> 14:46.802
The sextant is the unsung hero
of celestial navigation.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.514
It allows us to measure the angle
between the horizon…

14:51.599 --> 14:53.017
…and celestial bodies.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.416
Wherever you go, women end up dead.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.334
What?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.085
Can I have this?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.504
For five dollars.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.607
Who are you?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.217
Oh.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.094
-Babysitter.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.894
Oh my God. Oh my God.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.354
That's Lisa's body.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.231
He's got Lisa's body in there.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.295
Oh God. Oh.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.556
Are you fucking following me?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.479
-The fuck?
-I know what you did.

18:25.979 --> 18:26.814
What?

18:27.731 --> 18:28.857
What are you-- Hey.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.735
Hey, look. Stop it.
Stop it. Are you insane?

18:34.988 --> 18:36.490
You killed your wife.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.991
-What?
-And Emma's teacher.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.452
-What are you talking about?
-And you killed Lisa.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.664
Anna, how many times
do I have to tell you? Lisa is not dead.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.543
And how dare you say I had anything to do
with what happened to my wife.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.877
She drowned.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.089
-And you were a suspect.
-Yeah, and I was cleared.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.799
Because it was an accident.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.553
Do you know what?
I don't have to defend myself to you.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.930
I lost my wife.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.643
I miss her every single day.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.314
I would've thought you of all people
would know what that's like.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.484
To suffer a loss that's so huge

19:12.568 --> 19:16.488
it feels like the world
is just gone in an instant.

19:18.198 --> 19:23.370
What do you think that was like for Emma?
And then, 12 days later,

19:23.453 --> 19:25.080
after her mother's funeral,

19:25.914 --> 19:28.917
her teacher slips
and falls out of a fucking lighthouse!

19:29.001 --> 19:30.586
I mean, Jesus Christ!

19:31.086 --> 19:32.588
How much can one family take?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.094
Where did you get those scars?

19:40.470 --> 19:41.805
You're unbelievable.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.308
Fine, okay.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.936
That is from my neighbor's dog,
when I was a kid.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.441
And this is from when I donated
my kidney to my brother.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.611
And it didn't take,

19:56.361 --> 19:57.571
and then he died.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.284
Sorry. Is there something else miserable
from my life you want me to remember?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.413
Neil, I believe you.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.375
I mean, I want to believe you,

20:11.126 --> 20:12.836
but I need to see inside the bag.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.969
Fuck.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.642
Knock yourself out.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.279
What the fuck is this?

20:42.157 --> 20:43.575
It's my ventriloquist dummy.

20:45.160 --> 20:45.994
What?

20:55.545 --> 20:56.755
When my wife died,

20:58.131 --> 20:59.633
I wanted to die too.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
I thought about it…

21:03.553 --> 21:06.431
…believe me,
but it wouldn't have been fair to Emma.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.852
And then you hear the expression
"laughter's the best medicine,"

21:10.936 --> 21:12.062
and you just think,

21:13.146 --> 21:14.982
"What the fuck else do I have to lose?"

21:19.236 --> 21:23.198
I mean, actually, I guess
I could've tried becoming a drunk.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.158
But how's that working out for you, Anna?

21:27.202 --> 21:28.704
Coleman, you're on deck.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.122
Okay.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.963
Please don't tell anyone about this.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.342
The last thing I need
is a bunch of my neighbors

21:42.426 --> 21:44.761
knowing I do these dumb open mic nights.

22:21.631 --> 22:22.466
-Hello?
<i>Hi.</i>

22:22.549 --> 22:25.135
<i>I'm trying to reach</i>
<i>Douglas Whitaker's assistant.</i>

22:27.220 --> 22:28.138
Uh, this is she.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.474
<i> This is</i>
<i>the FBI Department of Records.</i>

22:30.974 --> 22:33.894
<i>We have the results</i>
<i>of the background checks you requested.</i>

22:33.977 --> 22:36.521
-Yes?
-<i> Nothing came up on Lisa Maines.</i>

22:36.605 --> 22:37.439
Huh.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.859
<i> We did, however,</i>
<i>get something on Rex Bakke.</i>

22:41.943 --> 22:44.488
-What is it?
-<i> Looks like his sheet goes back--</i>

22:44.571 --> 22:46.573
-Shh. Shh.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.451
After you.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.228
