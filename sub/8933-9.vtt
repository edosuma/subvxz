Yeaaaah!

00:23.690 --> 00:26.559
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

This metal detector
works great, Cedric.

01:16.443 --> 01:19.913
You know, this little gizmo
could make us a fortune.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.315
We could find dubloons

01:22.315 --> 01:25.585

I think, we've
got something here.

Bert, not this time.

Uh?! Railway track?

What are railway tracks
doing way out here?

01:57.484 --> 01:59.018
I don't know.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.754
There is no railway
line marked on this map.

02:01.754 --> 02:05.024
It must be an old spur
off the Evergreen line.

02:05.024 --> 02:08.027
Well, it sure
hasn't been used in years.

shoe company.

There's a fortune to be
made in elevator shoes!

Aw boss, it
can't be all that bad.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.261
Wanna bet? I borrowed
a million bucks from Knox

03:48.261 --> 03:50.129
to help finance this mess.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.966
I put the house up as
security against the loan.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.401
If I don't pay him
back in two days,

03:55.401 --> 03:57.904
Knox will own Sneer mansion.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.445
This is
an amazing find, Bert.

04:05.445 --> 04:08.381
There aren't many of these
old beauties around anymore.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.216
Apart from the rust,

04:10.216 --> 04:13.019
this old engine is
in pretty good shape.

04:13.019 --> 04:16.189
We've even got enough
coal to get up a head of steam.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.758
Ya, it's
going to be great;

04:18.758 --> 04:20.660
the rhythm of the rails...

04:28.801 --> 04:32.138
The mournful howl of the whistle

04:32.138 --> 04:34.507
as we rocket through the night.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.812
Hmmmm?

04:39.812 --> 04:42.248
You may have to delay
the trip a bit, Bert.

04:42.248 --> 04:43.916
This steam dome is shot.

04:43.916 --> 04:47.320
Steam dome?
Hmm, can you fix it?

04:47.320 --> 04:51.190
I can try, but it's
been patched up so many times,

04:51.190 --> 04:53.660
and the rust has
done a lot of damage.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.194
Can we get a new one?

04:55.194 --> 04:58.598
We could, if we had
about two hundred dollars.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.933
Huh?

05:00.933 --> 05:02.268
Yeah, well...

05:02.268 --> 05:04.504
We better try to fix it.

Uh huh. Ya.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.054
I see.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.855
Well thank you very much.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.792
What
did they say, Ralph?

05:25.792 --> 05:28.027
The train was
built by The Blue Spruce

05:28.027 --> 05:29.729
Rolling Stock Company,

05:29.729 --> 05:31.764
but they went out
business years ago.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.901
It looks like nobody
owns the old 504.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.169
That's great!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.004
Now the boys can fix it up,

05:38.004 --> 05:40.106
and turn it over to the
Evergreen museum.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.507
Ehm...

05:41.507 --> 05:44.544
Could a paying
customer get some attention?

05:44.544 --> 05:47.013

be back with more items.

We've got to
economize somewhere.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.964
Pig 2: But boss, one bean?

06:37.964 --> 06:40.366
Chew it slowly. Ha-ha!

06:40.366 --> 06:42.535
You oversized underachievers

06:42.535 --> 06:44.237
could stand to
lose a few pounds.

06:45.304 --> 06:49.442
So how much of that million
bucks have you raised?

06:49.442 --> 06:52.545
Well, with washing cars,

06:52.545 --> 06:54.747
taking in laundry
and raking lawns,

06:54.747 --> 06:58.184
we've raise two
hundred dollars!

06:58.184 --> 07:00.753
Um, after expenses.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.889
Expenses? What expenses?

07:02.889 --> 07:05.291
We had to buy a rake, Sir.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.294
Pig 2: And we figure we can
make at least $20

07:08.294 --> 07:10.296
at a bake sale, Sir.

07:10.296 --> 07:13.399
Great, only nine hundred
and ninety nine thousand

07:13.399 --> 07:15.168
eight hundred dollars to go.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.737
How am I going to raise
that by tomorrow?

07:17.737 --> 07:20.773
Cedric might
have some ideas, boss.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.776
Don't ever
mention this to Cedric.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.946
If he knew we were on the
verge of a permanent camp out,

07:26.946 --> 07:28.748
he'd worry himself sick.

07:28.748 --> 07:29.816
I'll handle it.

07:29.816 --> 07:30.817
Hi, Pop.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.088
I'm eating supper at the
Raccoon-dominium tonight, ok?

07:36.088 --> 07:37.323
Fine, Cedric.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.192
Lucky you.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.993
What's going on here, Pop?

07:40.993 --> 07:43.196
Oh! We are
trying to raise...

07:43.196 --> 07:44.197
Ouch!

07:45.431 --> 07:47.733
Uhm, spring cleaning!

07:47.733 --> 07:49.836
And, and where have
you been all day?

07:49.836 --> 07:52.638
Why, Pop? Did you
want me to do the accounts?

07:52.638 --> 07:57.944
No, no, just showing
a little fatherly interest. He!

07:57.944 --> 08:00.746
Bert and I found
an old steam engine.

08:00.746 --> 08:01.881
We are fixing it up

08:01.881 --> 08:03.216
and when we've got it running

08:03.216 --> 08:05.251
we're going to give
it to the museum.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.620
It will really be
something to see

08:07.620 --> 08:10.890
the old Evergreen 504
rolling down the rails.

08:10.890 --> 08:14.260
The only thing it needs
is a new steam dome.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.895
Got to go!

08:18.130 --> 08:22.201
Did he say Evergreen 504?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.072
Here it is, boss.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.975
The story of Snake Eyes LaTour,

08:28.975 --> 08:32.078
the last of the
great train robbers.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.079
I knew it!

08:33.079 --> 08:36.382
Here it is, the answer
to all my problems.

08:36.382 --> 08:40.720
Snake Eyes LaTour stole
the Evergreen 504.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.189
They caught him
shortly afterwards,

08:43.189 --> 08:45.725
but they never found the 504,

08:45.725 --> 08:47.960
or the payroll the
train was carrying.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.531
Somewhere on board that train is

08:51.531 --> 08:53.432
ten million dollars!!

08:53.432 --> 08:55.034
And it's going to be mine.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.540
how's it
going, Schaeffer?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.009
Well,
I tried, Melissa,

09:03.009 --> 09:05.478
but it's pretty
hard to weld rust.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.347
I'm afraid we need
a new steam dome.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.920
Pop, what
are you doing here?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.123
So this is the
old Evergreen 504, eh?

09:17.123 --> 09:19.592
You've done a fine job, boys!

09:19.592 --> 09:21.394
A fine job!

09:21.394 --> 09:24.630
Well, thanks,
Cyril, but ehm...

09:24.630 --> 09:28.968
since when are you interested
in old steam trains?

09:28.968 --> 09:32.071
Why the happiest
times of my youth were spent

09:32.071 --> 09:33.739
riding the rails.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.442
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to own one of these babies.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.444
This one in particular.

09:38.444 --> 09:42.915
Oh ya! Well, you can't
have this one in particular.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.051
We found it. We fixed it up!

09:45.051 --> 09:47.653
And we're going to
give it to the museum.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.389
Admirable sentiments. Admirable.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.893
If there was only something
I could do to help?

09:53.893 --> 09:57.330
Well, unless you've
got a spare steam dome with you,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.165
there's really
not a lot we could...

09:59.165 --> 10:01.467
Funny you should
mention steam domes.

10:01.467 --> 10:02.501
Pigs!

10:04.537 --> 10:05.805
Surprised?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.340
Um.. yes!

10:07.340 --> 10:10.142
Well, if you'll recall
Cedric you did mention

10:10.142 --> 10:11.811
you needed a steam dome,

10:11.811 --> 10:13.879
so I went out and bought one.

10:13.879 --> 10:18.317
Ya, with our
hard-earned $200!

10:18.317 --> 10:19.452
What
are you looking for

10:19.452 --> 10:21.954
in exchange for the
new steam dome, Cyril?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.990
Oh, nothing. Nothing!

10:23.990 --> 10:25.925
Just a small souvenir.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.461
Say the old steam dome.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.729
What do you say?

10:29.729 --> 10:32.164
It will make a good
planter or something.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.767
In that case,
you've got yourself a deal.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
Easy! Easy!

10:41.741 --> 10:42.942
That's it.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.382
I'd love to stay,

10:49.382 --> 10:51.951
but I've got to get back.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.890
I don't know
what's gotten into Pops,

10:57.890 --> 11:00.760
but he sure is acting strange.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.329
Hey guys, look at this!

11:03.329 --> 11:05.598
I found it in the firebox.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.402
Wow! An old wanted poster!

11:10.036 --> 11:16.042
Snake Eyes LaTour
wanted for train robbery.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.677
Well,
come on, you two,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.311
let's get up some steam.

11:19.845 --> 11:24.817
Gee, maybe Snake Eyes
robbed this very train.

Come on, Bert.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.210
We've got coal that
needs shoveling.

12:24.610 --> 12:28.114
Ah! With a few ferns
planted in it

12:28.114 --> 12:29.648
this old pot will look

12:29.648 --> 12:32.384
marvelous in your den, boss.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.987
Do I look like a
botanist, b-b brain?

12:34.987 --> 12:38.157
I've got no intention
of putting plants in it.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.759
Well, then why?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.893
It's
all right here.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.929
Snake Eyes LaTour
was very predictable.

12:43.929 --> 12:48.000
After stealing a train he always
hid the money in the steam dome,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.602
and came back for it later.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.838
This time they caught him
before he could come back.

12:52.838 --> 12:56.575
He hid the train so well,
no one ever found it.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.511
You mean..?
That's right, boys,

12:58.511 --> 13:01.647
there's ten million
dollars in that dome.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.185
Pig 2: But, boss,
it's stolen money.

13:06.185 --> 13:09.388
You could get in
even worse trouble.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.024
I'm not crazy
enough to spend hot cash,

13:12.024 --> 13:14.493
but there is always
a ten percent reward

13:14.493 --> 13:16.028
for returning stolen money

13:16.028 --> 13:19.832
and that comes to
one million dollars!

13:25.271 --> 13:27.640
Knox, Lady Baden-Baden,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.308
what are you doing here?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.310
Mr. Knox: My, my,

13:31.310 --> 13:34.980
what a gracious
welcome Mr. Sneer.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.348
In fact,

13:36.348 --> 13:39.151
I've come about
this small matter

13:39.151 --> 13:41.887
of a loans repayment.

13:41.887 --> 13:45.491
I assume you have it, Mr. Sneer.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.193
Of course,
I have the money.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.062
It's right in there.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.033
Mr. Knox: Strange place to keep

13:54.033 --> 13:57.670
your small change, Mr. Sneer.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.340
Well, Sir?

14:01.340 --> 14:04.810
Oh great! Snake
Eyes LaTour's last job

14:04.810 --> 14:07.513
and he changes
his modus operandi.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.647
Mr. Knox:

14:08.647 --> 14:13.018
Some problem raising
the cash, Mr. Sneer?

14:13.018 --> 14:15.521
Look, I've
still got six hours

14:15.521 --> 14:16.755
before the deadline.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.224
What's your hurry, Knox?

14:18.224 --> 14:21.594
Mr. Knox: Ooh,
no hurry, Mr. Sneer.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.363
I can wait.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.866
Lady Baden-Baden: What
are we waiting for, dear?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.602
Mr. Knox: Oh, nothing,
honey bunch.

14:29.602 --> 14:34.440
Mr. Sneer and I are
just talking business.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.408
Lady Baden-Baden: I'll just
take a walk around these

14:36.408 --> 14:38.477
lovely gardens then.

14:38.477 --> 14:43.883
Oooh, how I wish we had
such beautiful gardens.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.418
Mr. Knox: Well, you
might, my dear.

14:46.418 --> 14:49.321
You just might.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.556
Come on Knox!

14:50.556 --> 14:53.192
Would you really throw
me out of my own house?

14:53.192 --> 14:56.295
Mr. Knox: Oh,
heavens no, Sir!

14:56.295 --> 14:58.797
I'll wait six hours,

14:58.797 --> 15:02.301
and throw you out of mine.

15:06.772 --> 15:10.743
Oh boy! I can hardly
wait to get my hands

15:10.743 --> 15:14.914
on the throttle of
the old Evergreen 504.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.484
Wow, wooooowww!

15:18.484 --> 15:20.319
Chugga chugga chugga chugga!

15:20.319 --> 15:22.488
Wooo wooo wooo!

15:22.488 --> 15:25.291
Just as soon as we
check the line ahead, Bert.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.726
It hasn't been used
for a long time.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.329
We don't want the train
ending up in the rhubarb.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.433
Wow!

15:35.401 --> 15:38.137
I think we'd better
check this out on foot.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.239
Careful now!

15:40.239 --> 15:42.241
It looks fine to me.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.642
Let's get the engine.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.177
Yaaaaaah!

15:45.177 --> 15:47.813
Heeeeelp!

15:47.813 --> 15:50.649
I guess the old Evergreen 504

15:50.649 --> 15:53.018
isn't going anywhere
for a while,

15:53.018 --> 15:56.422
at least not until
the bridge is fixed.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.758
Faster! We've
got to find that money.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.761
Another hour and Knox will
have us out on the street.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.201
Not a raccoon in sight,

16:09.201 --> 16:10.436
what a break!

16:10.436 --> 16:11.804
Search the engine!

16:13.839 --> 16:15.674
Now if I was a train robber,

16:15.674 --> 16:17.810
where would I stash the loot?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.115
Whops!

16:23.115 --> 16:24.316
Pig 2: Aa-aaah!

16:24.316 --> 16:25.551
Oh-ooh!

16:25.551 --> 16:27.686
Oh, no!!

16:27.686 --> 16:29.521
Now you've done it.

16:29.521 --> 16:32.324
Abandon ship!

16:33.359 --> 16:36.061
Runaway train!

16:36.061 --> 16:38.063
Pig 2: Boss jump!

16:38.063 --> 16:39.365
What the..!!

16:40.933 --> 16:43.535
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

16:43.535 --> 16:45.804
Jump boss, jump!

16:46.538 --> 16:48.640
What are you,
porkers, babbling about?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.844
Boss, it's a runaway train.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.845
What?

16:52.845 --> 16:57.249
♪ (tense music) ♪

16:57.249 --> 16:59.251
I've got to stop this thing!

17:02.688 --> 17:03.889
Ah well,

17:03.889 --> 17:06.692
maybe people will come
out here to see the train.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.694
Yeaaaah!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.763
No!
The train will de-rail,

17:10.763 --> 17:12.197
if it hits the hand car.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.334
I can switch us
onto a siding.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.773
Yikes!

17:24.109 --> 17:26.912
Cedric/Bert:

17:26.912 --> 17:28.013
Pop!!

17:29.548 --> 17:31.216
We've got
to stop that train,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.152
before it hits the bridge.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.925
Where is the
ignition key?

17:39.925 --> 17:41.660
Ahhh!

17:45.864 --> 17:46.865
Ugh!

17:49.601 --> 17:50.969
Ahhh!

17:50.969 --> 17:52.371
I've
got you, Bert.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.709
Phew!

17:57.709 --> 17:59.945
Good thing, I don't
crack under pressure.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.715
Ahhh!

18:03.715 --> 18:05.717
Cyril! More steam!

18:05.717 --> 18:07.653
We need more steam!

18:07.653 --> 18:10.155
What in blue blazes
are you doing here?

18:10.155 --> 18:12.424
We came to rescue you!

18:12.424 --> 18:14.326
You are doing
a heck of a job.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.628
Cyril, you've
got to stoke the fire,

18:16.628 --> 18:18.430
build up the steam pressure.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.936
I thought stoking
was bad for your health.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.971
More coal, Cyril!

18:25.971 --> 18:27.940
More coal!

18:29.374 --> 18:31.810
Yahoo! I found it!

18:31.810 --> 18:33.612
I found the money!

18:33.612 --> 18:36.115
All my troubles are over.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.784
Stoke Cyril! Stoke!

18:38.784 --> 18:40.919
We are going oveeeer!

18:43.489 --> 18:45.124
There is not enough coal.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.629
I may never recover from this.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.132
Aaaaaah!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.500
I've heard
of money to burn,

18:54.500 --> 18:56.201
but this is ridiculous.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.273
That was close, Cyril!

19:01.273 --> 19:03.509
We owe you one.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.111
Ten million dollars!

19:06.879 --> 19:09.114
We don't
owe him that much.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.520
How about that, Schaeffer,

19:14.520 --> 19:18.423
the old wail of the whistle
sure draws a crowd!

19:25.330 --> 19:28.667
O-oh! The boss
doesn't look too happy.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.069
I guess, he didn't
find the money.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.638
Pig 2: Oooh!

19:32.638 --> 19:37.910
Lady Baden-Baden, will you be
needing three trustworthy

19:37.910 --> 19:42.181
and loyal employees to help
you run your new house?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.917
Lady Baden-Baden:
What are you talking about?

19:44.917 --> 19:48.253
I guess Sneer
mansion is all yours, Knox.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.254
What?

19:49.254 --> 19:50.522
I'm sorry, son.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.558
I didn't want this to happen.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.593
We lost our house?

19:54.593 --> 19:57.729
Never mind son,
we'll go somewhere else.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.666
Maybe find a nice little condo.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.202
Lady Baden-Baden: What's this
I've been hearing, Mr. Knox?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.138
Am I to understand you're
throwing Mr. Sneer

20:06.138 --> 20:09.875
and his fine son out
of their own home

20:09.875 --> 20:13.612
over a mere million-dollar debt?

20:13.612 --> 20:16.415
Mr. Knox: Business
is business, my dear.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.518
Lady Baden-Baden:
And friends are friends.

20:19.518 --> 20:23.088
Return those keys at once!

20:23.088 --> 20:26.892
I'm sure we can settle
on some reasonable form

20:26.892 --> 20:28.594
of repayment, Knox.

20:28.594 --> 20:32.864
Lady Baden-Baden: Ho-ho-ho,
as trustee of the museum,

20:32.864 --> 20:36.735
and a lover of the
romantic age of steam,

20:36.735 --> 20:38.937
I would like to
announce the formation

20:38.937 --> 20:44.142
of the Evergreen Steam
Heritage Foundation.

20:44.142 --> 20:50.449
Mr. Knox has agreed to finance
it, haven't you sweetness?

20:51.583 --> 20:56.121
Looks like things worked
out pretty well, Knox old buddy.

20:56.121 --> 20:59.891
Mr. Knox: Oh yes, old friend,

20:59.891 --> 21:02.828
and I believe I've
come up with a solution

21:02.828 --> 21:05.597
to our financial differences.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.499
Great! Great!

21:07.499 --> 21:09.067
Love to hear it!

21:12.771 --> 21:15.941
Lady Baden-Baden: I declare
the new steam service

21:15.941 --> 21:19.678
on the Evergreen line... open!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.614
Come on, boys,

21:22.614 --> 21:24.283
put your backs into it.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.452
Tickets!
Have your tickets ready.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.621
Do I have to do this?

21:29.621 --> 21:34.293
Knox, I promise,
I'll have the money next week!

21:34.293 --> 21:37.462
Mr. Knox: Hm, I'm sure you will,

21:37.462 --> 21:39.531
but until then, Sir,

21:39.531 --> 21:42.534
enjoy your work.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.038
