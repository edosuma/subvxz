WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.458
[instrumental music]

00:13.333 --> 00:14.583
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.250
I'm looking for the captain
and Ivanova.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.542
They went to Bay 13.
Uh, I can link in if you want.

00:18.625 --> 00:22.083
No-no-no, that's okay. I need to
talk to them in person. Thanks.

00:22.167 --> 00:24.708
Bay 13?
Nobody goes into Bay 13.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.292
That's what the commander
tried to tell them.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.667
[instrumental music]

00:32.833 --> 00:34.458
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:37.208 --> 00:38.750
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.917
There's no sign
of instrumentation

00:42.042 --> 00:45.500
no visible way in or out.

00:45.583 --> 00:49.708
It's absolutely seamless.
Amazing.

00:49.792 --> 00:53.042
What kind of propulsion system
does it have?

00:53.125 --> 00:54.500
No idea.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.125
In the two years
since Ambassador Kosh

00:56.208 --> 00:58.667
arrived in this...thing..

00:58.750 --> 00:59.958
...we've run a few surface scans

01:00.042 --> 01:01.917
as much as we thought
we could get away with.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.083
We could barely
even get through the skin.

01:04.167 --> 01:06.542
And it's just been sitting here
this whole time?

01:06.625 --> 01:08.000
Mostly.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.417
He's taken it out once or twice

01:09.500 --> 01:11.667
but just to the Vorlon Homeworld
and then back again.

01:13.042 --> 01:14.958
Sometimes..

01:15.042 --> 01:17.542
...late at night..

01:17.625 --> 01:19.333
...I just come here
and watch it.

01:21.042 --> 01:23.292
If you look carefully..

01:23.375 --> 01:26.708
'...you can actually see
the patterns on the skin..'

01:26.792 --> 01:29.500
'...changing slightly.'

01:29.583 --> 01:31.583
I can't even imagine
the kind of science

01:31.667 --> 01:33.750
that's behind
something like this.

01:35.292 --> 01:37.417
Why, they must be at least a

01:37.500 --> 01:40.375
a thousand years ahead of us.

01:43.708 --> 01:47.667
I'd give a year's pay to see
what's inside this thing.

01:53.375 --> 01:54.625
(Susan)
Captain!

02:00.417 --> 02:02.500
Back away slowly.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.417
[intense music]

02:14.708 --> 02:17.292
You can see why we've had
to quarantine this whole area.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.292
The last maintenance crew
we had in here..

02:21.375 --> 02:22.750
...wouldn't come back.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.167
They kept having dreams
about this thing.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.125
They said it talked to them
in their sleep.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.375
It's Kosh.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.292
He's been here for two years

02:37.375 --> 02:41.375
and we don't know
anything more about him..

02:41.458 --> 02:43.583
...his people,
or even this ship.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.625
Well, it's time that changed.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.708
I think I'm gonna make it
my personal project.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.958
Captain. I need to talk to you.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.500
- What's up?
- You too, commander?

02:56.583 --> 02:57.792
No, not here.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.250
I don't want this
on the links and I sure as hell

02:59.333 --> 03:01.458
don't wanna talk
in front of this thing.

03:01.542 --> 03:02.958
- Come on.
- Let's go.

03:04.375 --> 03:06.417
[intense music]

03:10.167 --> 03:11.417
[door closes]

03:36.875 --> 03:38.583
We just got a coded message
from Earthforce Intelligence

03:38.667 --> 03:39.917
ultraviolet priority.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.458
They posted
a system-wide fugitive alert

03:41.542 --> 03:42.708
for Dr. Everett Jacobs.

03:42.792 --> 03:43.792
Jacobs?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.458
He's on the President's
personal staff.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.792
Past tense. They say, he's on
the run carrying a fake ID

03:47.875 --> 03:49.292
and enough stolen information
to tear

03:49.375 --> 03:50.958
the whole Earth Alliance
to pieces

03:51.042 --> 03:51.958
unless we stop him.

03:52.042 --> 03:53.000
He's coming here?

03:53.083 --> 03:54.292
They think he's already here.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.333
And they want him,
alive if possible

03:56.417 --> 03:57.292
dead, if necessary.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.125
They authorized extreme sanction

03:59.208 --> 04:00.667
against a civilian?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.708
My God! What does this guy know?

04:06.208 --> 04:07.792
(Michael)
'They didn't say.'

04:07.875 --> 04:09.625
They're sending somebody here
to coordinate the search.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.750
All I know is this,
armed or otherwise

04:11.833 --> 04:13.667
if he gives any resistance

04:13.750 --> 04:15.375
our orders are shoot to kill.

04:19.625 --> 04:23.917
(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.875
A self-contained world
five miles long

04:27.958 --> 04:30.125
located in neutral territory.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.708
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

04:35.792 --> 04:39.542
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

04:39.625 --> 04:42.542
A shining beacon in space

04:42.625 --> 04:44.833
all alone in the night.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.333
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

04:48.417 --> 04:52.583
the year the great war
came upon us all.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.667
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.917
The year is 2259.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.208
The name of the place
is "Babylon 5."

05:02.292 --> 05:04.167
[theme music]

05:21.750 --> 05:23.792
[music continues]

05:49.917 --> 05:51.250
(John)
'So tell me, Agent Cranston'

05:51.333 --> 05:52.917
what does Earth's special
intelligence

05:53.000 --> 05:54.958
want with Dr. Jacobs?

05:55.042 --> 05:57.333
I assumed you had been briefed.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.792
Well, I know he is, or was the
President's personal physician.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.500
I didn't know
that gave him access

06:02.583 --> 06:03.792
to classified material.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.042
Apparently, he misused
his clearance

06:06.125 --> 06:08.917
to dip into highly
secret information..

06:09.000 --> 06:10.750
...new technology
we're developing

06:10.833 --> 06:13.708
uh, certain black projects

06:13.792 --> 06:15.792
covert missions.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.583
Enough to send
the entire government into chaos

06:18.667 --> 06:20.083
'and to ruin our agreements'

06:20.167 --> 06:22.458
'with half
the nonaligned worlds.'

06:24.125 --> 06:27.583
We cannot allow him to off-load
the information he's carrying.

06:27.667 --> 06:28.833
What's he doing here?

06:28.917 --> 06:30.458
Probably meeting his buyer

06:30.542 --> 06:34.208
or arranging travel outside
Earth-controlled space.

06:34.292 --> 06:35.833
This is our last chance
to catch him

06:35.917 --> 06:37.917
before he's out
of our jurisdiction.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.250
Alright..

06:42.333 --> 06:44.042
...we'll put security
at your disposal

06:44.125 --> 06:45.292
'to coordinate the search.'

06:45.375 --> 06:47.042
Excellent,
I'll have my men plug

06:47.125 --> 06:48.792
into your intellinets
immediately.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.292
We'll go level by level
until we flush him out.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.292
Commander, I want
all outgoing ships

06:54.375 --> 06:55.750
checked out before they leave.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.333
Slow down jump clearances
as much as you can.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.417
Tell them we're having
mechanical problems.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.667
- That they'll believe.
- Yeah.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.000
Now, if you'll show
Agent Cranston

07:04.083 --> 07:05.500
and his people
to their quarters

07:05.583 --> 07:07.875
I'll get Mr. Garibaldi
moving on the search.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.208
Captain, thank you.
We appreciate your cooperation.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.208
Thank you.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.083
Well, he knows
all the right things to say.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.542
Nothing sounded really bogus
as to raise any red flags

07:21.625 --> 07:23.167
but he's not
telling us everything.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.250
No, his type never does.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.333
But he is worried,
that's for sure.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.250
Which inclines me
to wanna go along with this

07:31.333 --> 07:33.833
until, and unless,
we hear otherwise.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.000
But if he is right..

07:37.083 --> 07:39.708
...we can't let Dr. Jacobs
get off this station.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.208
Oh, don't worry.

07:41.292 --> 07:43.667
If he's here, we'll find him.

07:43.750 --> 07:47.500
And I think I know where
to start asking some questions.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.833
It's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.042
- 'Then you do know him?'
- Know him?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.500
Michael, you ever consider

07:53.583 --> 07:54.917
climbing out
of the barracks sometime

07:55.000 --> 07:56.292
and looking around
at the world, huh?

07:56.375 --> 07:57.958
Yeah, I will.
When people stop shooting at me.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.708
Look, Dr. Jacobs
is a decent human being.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.208
He's a humanitarian.

08:02.292 --> 08:04.042
I studied under him
for two years at Harvard.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.125
And a lot of us looked up to him
as a role model.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.167
When I was having trouble
with xenobiogenics

08:09.250 --> 08:12.333
he was the only one who took
the time out to help me.

08:12.417 --> 08:15.208
I might not even be here
if it hadn't been for him.

08:15.292 --> 08:17.167
He's the best there is.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.083
Stephen, the last time
you vouched

08:19.167 --> 08:20.500
for a doctor friend of yours

08:20.583 --> 08:22.875
we had three dead bodies,
half the station was trashed

08:22.958 --> 08:24.917
an Ikarran war machine
was burning through decks

08:25.000 --> 08:25.958
and shooting at everything.

08:26.042 --> 08:27.125
Alright, fine.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.625
You don't want my advice,
don't ask for it

08:28.708 --> 08:30.833
but I'm telling you,
there's been some mistake.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.500
The Dr. Jacobs that I knew
would never sell out Earth.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.208
Maybe he's not
the same Dr. Jacobs

08:36.292 --> 08:37.542
you knew anymore.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.708
[indistinct chatter]

08:47.833 --> 08:49.833
[dramatic music]

09:04.333 --> 09:06.667
You, uh, looking for anything
in particular?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.375
Uh, no, no.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.042
Just, uh, just looking.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.458
Uh, excuse me. I..

09:22.042 --> 09:26.792
I hear that you're the man
to talk to about special orders.

09:28.917 --> 09:32.042
Well, uh, it depends
how special.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.208
I need an identicard.

09:34.292 --> 09:37.125
[chuckles]
You got expensive needs.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.750
[laughs]
Well..

09:38.833 --> 09:40.667
...whatever it is,
I'll pay for it.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.792
No deal.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.333
But, uh-uh,
you-you just said that--

09:45.417 --> 09:46.792
No, I didn't,
I didn't say anything.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.583
All I did was ask you
a couple of questions

09:48.667 --> 09:49.708
that's all.

09:49.792 --> 09:51.333
If-if it's the money, I have--

09:51.417 --> 09:53.875
No. You want it too much.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.833
That means you're either
working for security or..

09:55.917 --> 09:57.667
No, no, no.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.583
...you're on the run
from some really bad people.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.958
Either way, I'm out of it.

10:01.042 --> 10:02.125
Oh, no, please.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.375
Please, you've got..

10:05.792 --> 10:07.583
[intense music]

10:28.833 --> 10:31.417
Uh, afternoon, Ambassador Kosh.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.792
Just thought I'd make sure
you knew

10:32.875 --> 10:34.458
about the conference tomorrow

10:34.542 --> 10:36.875
to discuss
the Narn refugee problem.

10:38.292 --> 10:41.042
I found myself near
Bay 13 earlier.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.542
Got a look at your ship.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.583
It's an amazing piece of work.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.042
It made me realize just how much

10:46.125 --> 10:47.667
we still don't know about you

10:47.750 --> 10:50.667
your culture, your people.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.167
And I was thinking

10:52.250 --> 10:54.917
maybe we should spend
some time together soon..

10:55.000 --> 10:56.542
...build some bridges.

10:56.625 --> 11:00.333
Work toward a greater
understanding of one another.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.583
- Why?
- You tell me.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.917
You're the one
who popped in my dream

11:08.042 --> 11:09.208
when I was in that alien ship

11:09.292 --> 11:10.625
a few weeks ago.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.125
It felt like..

11:15.208 --> 11:17.375
...I don't know,
like you called to me.

11:19.708 --> 11:23.000
I sought understanding.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.583
I listened to the song.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.833
Your thoughts became the song.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.500
Has this ever happened before?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.792
Once.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.833
(Derek)
We'll operate
in rotating shifts.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.333
Ten hours on,
ten hours off.

11:43.417 --> 11:46.792
Have your squads check
every level down the air ducts..

11:46.875 --> 11:48.417
...and as we clear each sector

11:48.500 --> 11:49.875
we'll place guards behind us

11:50.000 --> 11:52.792
so that we'll sure
that he's not doubling back.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.000
With all due respect, sir

11:54.083 --> 11:55.000
what you're suggesting

11:55.083 --> 11:56.792
could take weeks or months.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.542
This place is five miles long.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.083
He could be hiding anywhere.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.083
These will help cut
the odds down a little.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.708
All high-ranking
Earthdome personnel

12:12.792 --> 12:16.208
are injected with a coded
identification crystal..

12:16.292 --> 12:18.708
...as a precaution
against kidnapping.

12:18.792 --> 12:21.292
Now it emits
a very low-level signal

12:21.375 --> 12:23.167
strictly short-range.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.625
I've stationed guards
with scanners

12:25.708 --> 12:27.458
at all the docking bays.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.083
He's locked in.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.542
All we need to do

12:30.625 --> 12:32.083
'is close the noose.'

12:33.458 --> 12:35.333
- Any problems yet?
- No, sir.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.958
These guys are about as subtle
as a brick

12:37.042 --> 12:38.833
through a glass window,
but they know their stuff.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.333
I hate to be on the wrong side
with this bunch against me.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.667
[intense music]

12:44.750 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, well,
we'll keep on top of them.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.417
[chuckles]
Just once I'd like to make it
through a crisis

12:49.500 --> 12:51.000
with a minimum of grief.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.042
Sir?

12:55.125 --> 12:57.667
Ah, there's something
I remembered I have to do.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.333
Keep me posted on what Cranston
and his people are up to.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.667
I'll check in with you later.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.583
[instrumental music]

13:07.375 --> 13:09.292
[intense music]

13:27.125 --> 13:29.042
The general sent me.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.625
I have a message.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.958
You're in great danger, captain.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.208
We know what you've been told.

13:40.292 --> 13:42.917
But Dr. Jacobs
is not a traitor.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.625
Then why is half
the intelligence community

13:46.708 --> 13:47.958
out looking for him?

13:48.042 --> 13:50.375
Earth special intelligence
is one of the few branches

13:50.458 --> 13:52.083
under President Clark's
direct control.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.750
Jacobs represents a threat

13:53.833 --> 13:57.083
and he's using
whatever resources he has

13:57.167 --> 13:58.500
to stop it..

13:58.583 --> 13:59.750
...including you.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.875
What's the situation?

14:04.083 --> 14:05.333
Before President Santiago

14:05.417 --> 14:07.708
was killed aboard
Earthforce One

14:07.792 --> 14:10.542
Clark got off the ship

14:10.625 --> 14:13.083
claiming he had
some kind of virus.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.000
Twenty-four hours later

14:15.083 --> 14:18.833
Earthforce One is destroyed
in an...accident

14:18.917 --> 14:22.167
and Clark...assumes
the presidency.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.417
Hm, a pretty damn
convenient illness.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.917
As Clark's personal physician

14:26.000 --> 14:27.792
Jacobs knew it wasn't true.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.583
If he would ever testify
to that effect

14:29.667 --> 14:31.583
it would help prove
that Clark knew

14:31.667 --> 14:33.750
what was going to happen.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.292
But they couldn't allow that.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.625
If they killed him right away

14:37.708 --> 14:38.792
it would look suspicious.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.625
So they kept an eye on him..

14:40.708 --> 14:43.875
...until they figured
it was safe for the good doctor

14:43.958 --> 14:45.917
to have an accident.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.458
We heard about it..

14:47.542 --> 14:48.792
...and we helped him escape.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.625
[chuckles]
It's not much of an escape.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.500
He's trapped here.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.750
This wasn't according to plan.

14:55.833 --> 14:56.958
'He was supposed to rendezvous'

14:57.042 --> 14:59.125
with his contact on Io.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.083
That meeting didn't go off.
They were closing in on him.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.667
So he jumped the first transport
he could find.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.250
And came here.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.875
So now you're improvising.
Terrific!

15:09.750 --> 15:11.458
'Cranston and his boys from ESI'

15:11.542 --> 15:13.125
have my entire security force

15:13.208 --> 15:14.458
out looking for Jacobs.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.458
If I pull them back now

15:16.542 --> 15:18.167
Cranston will know
I've been tipped off.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.833
And it'll expose everything that
we've started to build here.

15:20.917 --> 15:24.083
I don't have any
easy answers, captain.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.667
But it has to be done.

15:27.792 --> 15:31.500
His testimony alone isn't enough
to bring up charges..

15:31.583 --> 15:33.250
...but it's a start.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.500
We need to accumulate
as much evidence as we can

15:35.583 --> 15:39.000
so when we go public
with this..

15:39.083 --> 15:40.542
...we'll hit the target.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.250
Because in this game, captain..

15:44.333 --> 15:45.458
...you only get one shot.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.833
Find Jacobs before they do.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.250
Have him dictate
a sworn statement

15:49.333 --> 15:52.000
and get him
off this station, alive.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.417
Fine. No problem.
You want mayo on that?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.208
Captain.

15:56.292 --> 15:57.958
[sighs]
I know, I know.

15:58.042 --> 16:01.875
I...I just don't like
the odds, that's all.

16:01.958 --> 16:03.375
If we'd heard about this sooner

16:03.458 --> 16:05.833
we could have handled it
quietly.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.292
But now the whole
station's involved

16:07.375 --> 16:09.792
and we'll have to circumvent
our own people.

16:09.875 --> 16:12.917
If the other side
gets their hands on Jacobs

16:13.000 --> 16:14.750
they'll disappear him.

16:14.833 --> 16:17.250
They'll do the same to anyone
he talks to

16:17.333 --> 16:19.750
so whatever you're going to do..

16:19.833 --> 16:22.667
...I suggest you do it quickly.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.417
[intense music]

16:29.292 --> 16:31.708
[beeps]
Sheridan to Garibaldi.

16:31.792 --> 16:35.125
Meet me in my quarters
in ten minutes.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.625
You're gonna love this.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.583
So you'll notice
a routine scan of the eye

16:39.667 --> 16:41.500
shows the usual number
of rods and cones

16:41.583 --> 16:43.667
with the addition
of small parameter cells

16:43.750 --> 16:45.292
just before the optic bundle

16:45.375 --> 16:47.875
designed for seeing into
the ultraviolet frequencies.

16:47.958 --> 16:50.292
If you should have to operate
on this area..

16:53.333 --> 16:55.583
If you should have to operate
on this area I recommend..

16:55.667 --> 16:57.750
[computer beeping]

16:57.833 --> 16:59.083
Excuse me one moment.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.125
Set up the scanners to move
into the optic cavity

17:01.208 --> 17:02.833
so we can proceed.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
- Yes.
-' Hi, doc.'

17:07.083 --> 17:09.917
Just wanted to say
happy birthday. That's all.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.042
What are you talking about?
It's not my birthday.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.458
Catch you later.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.708
What the hell is..

17:19.958 --> 17:21.083
Do you mind?

17:21.167 --> 17:22.333
Let's go.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.292
Computer, play back last message
frame by frame.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.000
Look for any abnormalities.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.125
[automated response]
'Stand by.'

17:34.250 --> 17:36.292
[intense music]

17:38.208 --> 17:39.333
[computer beeps]

17:42.542 --> 17:44.583
[music continues]

17:58.042 --> 17:59.167
[hissing]

18:00.833 --> 18:01.833
[sighs]

18:04.125 --> 18:05.958
[grunting]

18:13.167 --> 18:14.667
I-I'm, uh..

18:14.750 --> 18:17.875
...I'm nearly out of stims.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.458
I have to keep moving.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.542
If I fall asleep,
they'll get me

18:23.625 --> 18:26.333
and, uh, if they get me

18:26.417 --> 18:27.792
I, uh..

18:31.917 --> 18:35.083
I-I don't know if this will
get to you, Mary, but..

18:37.250 --> 18:38.542
...I'm tired.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.167
I'm just desperately tired.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.708
I don't know who to turn to, uh

18:46.792 --> 18:48.625
whom I can trust.

18:48.708 --> 18:50.375
[clattering]

18:54.083 --> 18:56.125
[intense music]

18:58.333 --> 18:59.875
(male #1)
'Get your hands off me.'

19:01.875 --> 19:03.375
[beeping]

19:08.833 --> 19:10.208
Uh. Uh.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.583
[door opens]

19:17.958 --> 19:21.000
Ah! Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing, man?

19:21.083 --> 19:24.000
- Hey, hold on, hold on.
- You got something?

19:24.083 --> 19:25.167
[beeping]

19:26.292 --> 19:27.583
I don't know.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.292
[door closes]

19:34.417 --> 19:35.583
It's gone now.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.125
You think we should report it,
just in case?

19:39.208 --> 19:41.083
Yeah. Let's go.
Come on.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.708
Well, maybe now you'll admit
that you were wrong

19:42.792 --> 19:43.958
about Jacobs.

19:44.042 --> 19:45.250
- I didn't say I believe him.
- Yeah.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.792
But you didn't say
you believed me, either.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.125
I don't believe anybody.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.875
What a wonderful world
you live in.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, well, the rent is cheap,
the pay is decent

19:52.083 --> 19:53.167
and I get to make my own hours.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.917
Now, are you gonna help me

19:55.000 --> 19:57.083
or spend the next two days
analyzing my lifestyle?

19:57.167 --> 19:58.417
Alright, alright,
go ahead, go ahead.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.250
And my people reported
a blip on their scanners

20:00.333 --> 20:01.792
about an hour ago
in Brown Two.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.125
Maybe it's Jacobs. Maybe not.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.375
Either way,
it's a good place to start.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.917
Now, we can't bring
my people on this

20:07.000 --> 20:08.083
because the captain doesn't
wanna place them

20:08.167 --> 20:09.583
in jeopardy and neither do I.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.125
So we're gonna have to go in
after him ourselves..

20:12.208 --> 20:13.625
...unofficially.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.292
Which means you have
to go up against

20:15.375 --> 20:16.792
your own security force?

20:16.875 --> 20:18.708
And it won't be easy.
I trained them myself.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.500
They're pretty damn good,
but I do have one advantage

20:20.583 --> 20:23.458
that they don't. I've got
you and you know Jacobs.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.042
And if anybody can help me
find him, it's you.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.125
- Won't you be recognized?
- Are you kidding?

20:28.208 --> 20:29.625
First, I don't get
into Downbelow a lot.

20:29.708 --> 20:30.875
And second, when I do,
they don't see me

20:30.958 --> 20:32.000
they see the badge.

20:32.083 --> 20:35.250
And third, I have
an excellent disguise.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.375
Let's go.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.292
Why is my life suddenly passing

20:38.375 --> 20:40.375
in front of my eyes?

20:43.375 --> 20:44.458
[door opens]

20:48.500 --> 20:50.542
[intense music]

20:59.958 --> 21:02.125
You don't belong here.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.500
Your clothes say money.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.792
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.333
Now, please.
Just get out of my way.

21:08.417 --> 21:09.875
What is it?

21:09.958 --> 21:13.250
Dust? Guns?

21:13.333 --> 21:14.875
You're buying or selling..

21:16.333 --> 21:17.875
...or running away?

21:18.958 --> 21:21.125
That it?

21:21.208 --> 21:22.875
Somebody chasing you?

21:24.458 --> 21:27.208
Now why would that be?

21:27.292 --> 21:30.250
Unless maybe you got something
somebody wants.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.208
I don't want any trouble.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.875
I'll pay you whatever you want.

21:41.042 --> 21:43.042
Yeah, you will.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.417
Why don't you just listen
to what I say?

21:55.500 --> 21:57.375
There's nothing of value
in there.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.375
(Jacobs on recorder)
'Mary, I don't know'

22:01.458 --> 22:03.208
'if you'll ever get this, uh'

22:03.292 --> 22:04.375
'but I wanted to make sure..'

22:04.458 --> 22:05.792
That's personal.

22:05.875 --> 22:07.083
Nice.

22:07.167 --> 22:09.375
I could pick up a few credits
for this one.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.583
What's this?

22:13.667 --> 22:16.125
A fake pocket?

22:16.208 --> 22:18.000
You've been holding out on me.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.375
Data crystal.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.417
'What's on it?'

22:25.500 --> 22:27.125
'Names?'

22:27.208 --> 22:28.708
Account numbers?

22:29.917 --> 22:31.167
Files?

22:31.250 --> 22:33.250
There's nothing there
that would interest you.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.042
Everything interests me.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.917
[dramatic music]

22:39.958 --> 22:41.000
[sighs]

22:44.167 --> 22:46.583
[whistles]

22:46.667 --> 22:47.917
Looks like a real antique

22:48.000 --> 22:50.875
not one of those knockoffs.

22:50.958 --> 22:54.667
"Office of the President
of the Earth Alliance."

22:54.750 --> 22:56.917
It was a gift.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.125
I knew you didn't
belong down here.

23:00.458 --> 23:01.708
Keep him here.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.292
'Don't hurt him
unless you have to.'

23:05.417 --> 23:07.417
I'm gonna find out
what's on here.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.792
Maybe somebody will pay good
money to get it back.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.583
If not..

23:14.667 --> 23:16.750
...maybe somebody will pay
good money for him.

23:19.833 --> 23:23.167
And we've made complete scans
of levels one through fifteen

23:23.250 --> 23:25.208
starting with Blue Sector

23:25.292 --> 23:27.667
moving across to this part
of Brown Sector.

23:27.750 --> 23:31.333
He has to be in this area,
the area you call Downbelow.

23:31.417 --> 23:32.625
Unless you've missed something.

23:32.708 --> 23:33.958
'Unlikely.'

23:34.042 --> 23:35.958
'Your security forces
are very efficient.'

23:36.042 --> 23:37.167
Good.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.667
The sooner we get him
out of here

23:38.750 --> 23:40.833
and into a nice comfortable
interrogation room

23:40.917 --> 23:43.458
the happier I'll be
about the whole thing.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.458
Yep. You're right.

23:45.542 --> 23:48.167
He's got to be in Downbelow.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.708
Well, sir, you don't know
that for sure.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.292
Commander, where else
could he be?

23:52.375 --> 23:54.625
I mean, come on next thing
you'll be saying he's Downtown.

23:54.708 --> 23:57.208
I didn't see anything
called "Downtown."

23:57.292 --> 23:58.667
Well, it's sort
of the unofficial name

23:58.750 --> 24:01.250
for this area right in here.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.458
It's between the hull

24:02.542 --> 24:04.500
and the water
reclamation system..

24:04.583 --> 24:07.375
It's the pretty much the most
unpleasant part of the station

24:07.458 --> 24:10.375
'not counting
the methane bathrooms.'

24:10.458 --> 24:13.000
It's, uh,
full of heavy machinery

24:13.083 --> 24:15.958
lead walls, and pipe
all over the place.

24:16.042 --> 24:17.250
- Lead?
- Yeah.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.667
That is just the kind of thing

24:18.750 --> 24:21.167
he'd use to block the scanners.

24:22.542 --> 24:23.625
You think so?

24:23.708 --> 24:26.042
[beeps]
Cranston here.

24:26.125 --> 24:29.083
'Take the search team
out of Downbelow for now.'

24:29.167 --> 24:32.333
Check levels 50 and 51

24:32.417 --> 24:34.250
between the Blue
and Grey Sectors

24:34.333 --> 24:37.333
and post guards
at all the entrances and exits

24:37.417 --> 24:38.542
to Downbelow.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.292
(male #2 on speaker)
'Confirmed.'

24:40.375 --> 24:41.542
Good thinking, Sheridan.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.333
I'll keep you informed
on what we find.

24:46.958 --> 24:48.375
Downtown?

24:48.458 --> 24:50.292
Seemed like a good name.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.792
Those levels have been sealed,
welded shut

24:52.875 --> 24:55.083
since the station went online
three years ago.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.542
Do you know how many pressure
doors they're gonna have

24:56.625 --> 24:58.417
to burn through in order
to check the whole area?

24:58.500 --> 25:01.208
Forty seven. Not counting the
two big ones on either side of--

25:01.292 --> 25:03.333
- The waste recycling plant.
- Yeah.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.292
Mr. Cranston and his associates
are gonna be quite

25:05.375 --> 25:07.458
ripe by the time they return
from Downtown.

25:07.542 --> 25:11.417
Yeah, with luck, it'll buy
Garibaldi five or six hours.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.875
Let's just hope that's enough.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.000
[beeps]

25:16.292 --> 25:18.042
- Sheridan. What is it?
- 'Captain..'

25:18.125 --> 25:19.125
(male #3 on speaker)
'One of the ambassadors'

25:19.208 --> 25:20.458
'is asking to see you.'

25:22.000 --> 25:23.417
Can it wait until morning?

25:23.500 --> 25:26.583
'I don't know, sir.
It's Ambassador Kosh.'

25:26.667 --> 25:27.917
Captain, the two years
since I've been here

25:28.000 --> 25:29.917
Kosh has never asked
to speak to anybody.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.042
Uh, tell him I'll be there
as soon as I can.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.792
[instrumental music]

25:38.083 --> 25:39.083
- Anything?
- No.

25:39.167 --> 25:40.292
He thinks he may
have seen someone

25:40.375 --> 25:41.417
matching Jacobs' description

25:41.500 --> 25:43.417
couple of hours ago,
but he's not sure.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.875
- You?
- Not much.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.375
My people have already
been over this section

25:46.458 --> 25:47.833
so they're skittish,
they don't wanna answer

25:47.917 --> 25:49.667
too many questions.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.917
It's funny how all the guards
disappeared so fast.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.417
- Captain?
- Huh, probably.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.292
I don't know how, but if anybody
could figure some way

25:56.375 --> 25:59.417
to distract Cranston's
bloodhounds, it's him.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.292
Come on. Let's sit. Ah.

26:02.375 --> 26:03.833
Sit? Wait.

26:03.917 --> 26:06.458
I thought we were supposed
to be looking for Jacobs.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.792
We have been walking
for six hours.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.042
My feet hurt.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.292
It's probably midnight
or one, topside.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.750
Every cop knows you gotta keep
your strength up on a stakeout.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.375
So I strongly suggest
you eat something.

26:17.458 --> 26:19.833
Now, you're a doctor.
You should know better.

26:24.292 --> 26:27.792
So, you and, uh, Jacobs..

26:27.875 --> 26:29.333
...go back a ways, huh?

26:29.417 --> 26:31.833
Yeah.
Before the big war.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.667
Best teacher on campus.

26:36.042 --> 26:37.125
Been everywhere.

26:38.917 --> 26:40.500
Used to spend all day
between classes

26:40.583 --> 26:42.458
talking about all
the things he'd seen.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.750
Quite a time.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.667
Earth had beaten the Dilgar

26:48.750 --> 26:49.917
and we've been
setting up outposts

26:50.000 --> 26:52.042
all over the place.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.667
Looking to the future
with that reckless enthusiasm

26:54.750 --> 26:56.583
you have when you're 22

26:56.667 --> 26:58.208
when your whole life's
ahead of you.

26:58.292 --> 27:01.458
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.

27:01.542 --> 27:05.083
Back then it was like
some long summer night.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.167
Crazy, innocent

27:07.250 --> 27:09.708
optimistic as hell, but..

27:09.792 --> 27:11.375
...I don't know..

27:11.458 --> 27:12.458
...somewhere along the line

27:12.542 --> 27:16.042
we...lost something somewhere.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.458
I think we lost interest
in the future

27:17.542 --> 27:19.167
when all the things
we were told were coming

27:19.250 --> 27:20.375
finally got here.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.167
It wasn't what we thought
it was gonna be.

27:26.208 --> 27:29.208
It's like when you keep bugging
your folks for that

27:29.292 --> 27:31.125
one special toy for Christmas

27:31.208 --> 27:33.792
and when you finally
get it's..

27:33.875 --> 27:36.375
...not as great
as the vids made it look.

27:36.458 --> 27:37.708
Just doesn't run right.

27:39.292 --> 27:41.208
And you're so disappointed,
you shove it

27:41.292 --> 27:43.583
in the closet
and you never take it out again.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.542
Maybe somebody
should have labeled the future

27:45.625 --> 27:47.625
"Some assembly required."

27:49.333 --> 27:52.292
Finest workmanship.
It's a real antique.

27:52.375 --> 27:54.042
[dramatic music]

27:55.292 --> 27:57.583
I'm talking 19th,
20th century.

27:57.667 --> 28:00.542
It's something..
Hey, what are you doing?

28:00.625 --> 28:02.833
This is Jacobs'.
I recognize it.

28:02.917 --> 28:04.083
Where did you get this?

28:04.167 --> 28:05.833
I bought it.
What's it to you?

28:05.917 --> 28:07.292
Hey, you wanna buy it,
you make an offer.

28:07.375 --> 28:08.833
No, no, no,
who sold it to you?

28:08.917 --> 28:11.417
- Some guy. I don't know.
- What'd he look like?

28:11.500 --> 28:12.583
What am I, a camera?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.125
What you gonna be
is a smear on the deck

28:14.208 --> 28:16.583
if you don't answer
my friend's question.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.083
I don't want any trouble here.

28:19.167 --> 28:22.333
I just buy merchandise.
I don't ask where it comes from.

28:22.417 --> 28:23.375
Station rat like you
always knows

28:23.458 --> 28:24.750
who he's doing business with.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.458
Now I want a name
and you're gonna give it to me.

28:26.542 --> 28:28.458
I-I don't give out
names, you know.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.500
It's, uh, it's bad for business.

28:31.583 --> 28:32.583
Yeah, well, so is having
your eyeballs

28:32.667 --> 28:33.958
spooned out and served on toast.

28:34.042 --> 28:35.292
Now make up your mind
and make it up fast

28:35.375 --> 28:37.458
because it is getting
awfully close

28:37.542 --> 28:39.750
to my breakfast time.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.167
Sir, there's someone on the line

28:41.250 --> 28:42.917
who says he's seen Jacobs.

28:44.042 --> 28:45.458
Put him on.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.125
I understand you have
something for me, mister..

28:50.208 --> 28:52.583
Who I am doesn't matter.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.958
But I heard a few things
and I think got the guy

28:55.042 --> 28:56.625
you're looking for.

28:56.708 --> 28:59.125
- Where is he?
- Safe.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.000
He'll stay that way, too..

29:01.083 --> 29:03.500
...but I want a finder's fee.

29:03.583 --> 29:06.292
Ten thousand credits
on delivery.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.250
I think I can arrange that.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.958
Good.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.542
I'll call you when I'm ready
to make the exchange.

29:18.083 --> 29:19.875
[intense music]

29:21.250 --> 29:23.292
You wanted to see me?

29:24.833 --> 29:27.167
You wanted to see me.

29:27.250 --> 29:29.500
Well, I guess everybody does.

29:29.583 --> 29:30.708
To see what you really are

29:30.792 --> 29:32.792
in-inside that encounter suit.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.708
They are not ready.

29:35.792 --> 29:38.125
They would not understand.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.458
Am I ready?

29:40.500 --> 29:41.583
No.

29:41.667 --> 29:44.792
You do not even
understand yourself.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.833
Could you help me
to understand you?

29:48.667 --> 29:52.083
Can you help me
to understand you?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.750
Well, I can try.

29:54.833 --> 29:57.083
Is that what you want?

29:57.167 --> 29:59.292
An exchange of information?

29:59.375 --> 30:01.042
I tell you something about me

30:01.125 --> 30:03.583
and you-you tell me
something about you?

30:05.458 --> 30:06.625
No.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.375
You do not understand.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.292
Go.

30:14.375 --> 30:15.875
Damn it, what do you want?

30:15.958 --> 30:17.500
What do you want from me?

30:18.458 --> 30:19.708
You know ever since I got here

30:19.792 --> 30:21.208
I've had the feeling that..

30:21.292 --> 30:24.000
...that you've been watching me.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.250
The record shows you hardly ever

30:25.333 --> 30:27.500
went to council meetings
until I showed up.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.917
When I was captured..

30:30.000 --> 30:31.708
...it was you..

30:31.792 --> 30:35.125
...who reached out
and touched my mind.

30:36.958 --> 30:38.958
And now you call me here.

30:39.042 --> 30:40.042
Why?

30:40.125 --> 30:41.542
Just to throw me out?

30:42.958 --> 30:44.333
Are we just toys to you?

30:45.417 --> 30:47.625
Huh? What do you want?

30:47.708 --> 30:49.667
[instrumental music]

30:49.750 --> 30:52.083
Never ask that question.

30:53.917 --> 30:56.250
At least I got a response
out of you.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.167
[music continues]

30:59.750 --> 31:01.458
So what'll it be, ambassador?

31:03.375 --> 31:04.583
I will teach you.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.542
About yourself?

31:09.042 --> 31:11.125
About you.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.875
Until you are ready.

31:14.833 --> 31:16.625
For what?

31:16.708 --> 31:19.333
To fight legends.

31:19.958 --> 31:22.042
[knocks on door]

31:22.125 --> 31:24.042
Max?

31:24.125 --> 31:25.917
[dramatic music]

31:30.208 --> 31:32.292
Inside. Nice and slow.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.208
And keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.417
Untie him.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.542
[music continues]

31:40.208 --> 31:42.208
Don't move.

31:42.292 --> 31:44.375
Come on, doc.
Hurry up, will you?

31:44.458 --> 31:45.708
[grunts]

31:46.542 --> 31:47.792
[grunts]

31:47.875 --> 31:49.667
[intense music]

31:51.875 --> 31:53.708
- You alright? Let me see it.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.000
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Now, come on.

31:55.083 --> 31:56.333
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

31:56.417 --> 31:57.542
Go on.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.708
[grunts]

31:59.792 --> 32:01.667
- Come on. Up.
- Stephen?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.417
No, no, no names
until we're topside, alright?

32:03.500 --> 32:05.625
We've been sent to find you.
You're safe now. You're safe.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.625
Uh, no.
I mean, that doesn't matter.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.667
I mean, it's,
it's that other man.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.125
It's that Max!

32:11.208 --> 32:12.792
'He's got a data crystal.'

32:12.875 --> 32:15.000
It's-it's crucial evidence.

32:15.083 --> 32:18.333
Copies of all
the examinations I made

32:18.417 --> 32:19.542
of the President.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.333
Ah, nuts.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.625
Okay, doc. Change of plans.
You gotta get him out of here.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.333
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna
wait for you, alright?

32:26.417 --> 32:28.125
You're the only one that knows
the back way out of here

32:28.208 --> 32:30.500
around those scanners, we can't
afford to lose you, come on!

32:30.583 --> 32:33.083
You won't. Come on we don't
have time to argue about this.

32:33.167 --> 32:35.083
There's an old storage locker
one level up.

32:35.167 --> 32:36.333
You wait there..

32:36.417 --> 32:37.708
...I'll get the crystal.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.458
Come on.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.625
[intense music]

32:47.125 --> 32:49.250
[instrumental music]

33:01.458 --> 33:02.875
Chase.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.042
Mm.

33:04.125 --> 33:06.583
[dramatic music]

33:06.667 --> 33:07.708
[grunting]

33:12.625 --> 33:15.208
Hey, Max.

33:15.292 --> 33:17.333
Give me the data crystal.

33:19.167 --> 33:21.875
[chuckles]
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.417
Look, uh..

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
[zapping]

33:25.500 --> 33:27.625
...I don't have time for this.

33:27.708 --> 33:30.292
It's because
I've had a really...bad day.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.625
And I'm in a really bad mood.

33:34.667 --> 33:35.667
In fact..

33:35.750 --> 33:37.875
[laughs]
...I'm damn cranky.

33:37.958 --> 33:39.125
[Michael laughs]

33:39.208 --> 33:40.583
So why don't you give me

33:40.667 --> 33:42.083
the fraggin' data crystal

33:42.167 --> 33:43.917
before I start to get surly.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.583
Which is something
that you really..

33:46.667 --> 33:47.917
'...really..'

33:49.708 --> 33:51.792
...really...don't want.

33:54.292 --> 33:56.083
[dramatic music]

34:01.833 --> 34:03.042
I've checked the station logs.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.792
I noticed that twice before

34:04.875 --> 34:06.000
you used the internal scanners

34:06.083 --> 34:07.917
to pinpoint a radiation source

34:08.000 --> 34:09.792
inside Babylon 5.

34:09.875 --> 34:12.292
And it took lot of rewiring
to make it work.

34:12.375 --> 34:14.208
Yes, but it is doable.

34:14.292 --> 34:16.042
I'd like to know
why you didn't mention

34:16.125 --> 34:17.542
this possibility

34:17.625 --> 34:19.458
when we first came aboard?

34:19.542 --> 34:20.792
Ah, captain, we've run into

34:20.875 --> 34:22.292
a little crisis
with Dr. Franklin.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.167
'He needs to see you
as soon as possible.'

34:26.958 --> 34:28.792
If you will excuse me,
Mr. Cranston.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.625
This will only take a moment.

34:33.417 --> 34:35.458
Very well. Perhaps you can
answer my question.

34:35.542 --> 34:37.333
I want to know
why I was not told

34:37.417 --> 34:39.875
about the internal
scanners before..

34:39.958 --> 34:41.208
...and how long will it take
to interface it

34:41.292 --> 34:43.917
with our system
now that I do know?

34:45.292 --> 34:47.750
A, you didn't ask.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.500
B, we don't know
the systems are compatible.

34:50.583 --> 34:53.542
C, assuming they are,
2.3 hours

34:53.625 --> 34:56.375
And D, at an early age
someone should have told you

34:56.458 --> 34:58.500
you can attract a lot
more flies with honey

34:58.583 --> 35:01.167
than with vinegar, sir.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.167
[instrumental music]

35:03.250 --> 35:04.417
Well, there it is.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.292
It contains the records
of my examinations

35:07.375 --> 35:10.000
of then Vice President Clark..

35:10.083 --> 35:12.500
...before and after
he supposedly

35:12.583 --> 35:14.792
contracted a viral infection.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.750
I've already given Mr. Garibaldi

35:16.833 --> 35:19.833
the code to unlock the data.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.958
And they show no indication
that he was suffering

35:22.042 --> 35:23.167
from any kind
of medical problems?

35:23.250 --> 35:24.083
None.

35:24.167 --> 35:25.292
Which helps us prove that

35:25.375 --> 35:26.833
he deliberately
didn't want to be

35:26.917 --> 35:28.708
on Earthforce One

35:28.792 --> 35:30.375
just one day
before it exploded.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.417
Alright, we'll also need
to get a statement from you..

35:32.500 --> 35:35.292
Ow! Do you mind?

35:35.375 --> 35:38.042
You were his teacher. What did
he get in first aid class?

35:38.125 --> 35:39.208
4.0.

35:39.292 --> 35:40.917
- 3.7.
- What?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.542
Ow!

35:42.625 --> 35:44.208
Forget it. Never mind,
alright? Forget I asked.

35:44.292 --> 35:45.583
Look, if you want
better treatment

35:45.667 --> 35:46.792
we could go to Medlab.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.375
No, I'd have to answer
too many questions.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.875
Just try to keep both arms
the same length, alright?

35:50.958 --> 35:54.375
(John)
'We still got one other
problem facing us, people.'

35:54.458 --> 35:56.167
Cranston's figured out
that they can patch

35:56.250 --> 35:57.708
their scanners
through our system.

35:57.792 --> 36:00.208
- Nuts.
- Now, what does that mean?

36:00.292 --> 36:02.333
(John)
'It means that as soon
as they're online'

36:02.417 --> 36:03.958
they can just flip a switch

36:04.042 --> 36:06.125
and see where you are.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.125
(Stephen)
'Is there any way we can get him
off the station?'

36:08.208 --> 36:09.375
Nah, not a chance,
they've got every

36:09.458 --> 36:10.958
single docking bay covered.

36:11.042 --> 36:14.917
Hm, not entirely
correct, Mr. Garibaldi.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.083
He's got a plan.
I can tell.

36:17.167 --> 36:19.125
He's got that look.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.292
[instrumental music]

36:23.917 --> 36:26.125
Internal scanners are now
configured with yours.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.500
Just double-checking
the interface

36:30.583 --> 36:32.000
to be sure
it's working properly.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.375
Commander, Ambassador Kosh

36:33.458 --> 36:34.917
requesting permission to depart.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.583
Tell him to wait.
Begin scan.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.417
Scanning on.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.667
[beeps]

36:41.833 --> 36:43.625
[instrumental music]

36:49.333 --> 36:51.208
[automated response]
'Scanning complete.'

36:51.292 --> 36:53.125
'Subject not found.'

36:53.208 --> 36:54.292
What?

36:54.375 --> 36:56.458
[music continues]

36:57.417 --> 36:59.500
That's impossible.

36:59.583 --> 37:01.500
Are you sure the interface
is working properly?

37:01.583 --> 37:04.208
(Susan)
'Five by five. It's reaching
every level at full strength.'

37:04.292 --> 37:05.375
The only reason
he wouldn't show up

37:05.458 --> 37:06.667
is if he isn't here.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.417
(John)
'Mr. Cranston,
I took you at your word'

37:08.500 --> 37:09.958
'that Dr. Jacobs was here.'

37:10.042 --> 37:11.458
If you've turned
my entire station

37:11.542 --> 37:12.833
upside down for nothing--

37:12.917 --> 37:14.792
Ambassador Kosh again
requests permission--

37:14.875 --> 37:16.417
Fine, fine,
tell him he can go.

37:22.625 --> 37:24.833
I don't understand it.

37:24.917 --> 37:26.500
Our best information

37:26.583 --> 37:28.125
said that he was coming here.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.125
And the man who tried
to sell me the information--

37:30.208 --> 37:32.292
Around here,
if you offer to pay

37:32.375 --> 37:33.875
for something or someone

37:33.958 --> 37:35.750
you'll get ten people
claiming to have it

37:35.833 --> 37:37.500
and they'll try to scam you
out of the money.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.833
Ambassador Kosh ready
for jumpgate sequence.

37:39.917 --> 37:41.833
- Okay, tell him can--
- Just a minute!

37:41.917 --> 37:44.958
Now I was not informed
about a launch.

37:45.042 --> 37:48.458
The Vorlon ambassador's
ship is in Bay 13.

37:48.542 --> 37:50.000
No one goes there except him.

37:50.083 --> 37:53.000
I want the ship scanned
before it's allowed to jump.

37:53.083 --> 37:56.083
Maybe you didn't hear me,
that's an ambassadorial vessel.

37:56.167 --> 37:59.167
He won't know.
I want it scanned.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.542
Now, that should not be
a problem for you, captain

38:01.625 --> 38:03.792
if there's nothing to hide.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.250
[dramatic music]

38:08.250 --> 38:10.333
Initiate scan.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.500
[music continues]

38:13.583 --> 38:15.292
Computer, analyze ship.

38:15.375 --> 38:16.708
'Are there any
life forms present?'

38:16.792 --> 38:17.875
[beeping]

38:17.958 --> 38:19.042
[automated response]
'Confirmed.'

38:19.125 --> 38:21.458
'One life form detected.'

38:21.542 --> 38:24.042
Is it human?

38:24.125 --> 38:25.333
[automated response]
'Negative.'

38:25.417 --> 38:28.542
'Registering non-human
life form.'

38:28.625 --> 38:30.458
Maybe we can call it back..

38:30.542 --> 38:33.125
...escort Ambassador Kosh
off his own ship and search it

38:33.208 --> 38:37.208
even if it does mean
violating Vorlon territory.

38:37.292 --> 38:40.042
I mean, I'm up
for it if you are.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.750
I'm sure it'd cause
a major diplomatic

38:42.833 --> 38:45.375
incident without cause.

38:45.458 --> 38:46.917
It'd probably be
all over the news

38:47.000 --> 38:49.250
with everyone wanting
to know why we did it

38:49.333 --> 38:50.625
but still I'm, uh..

38:50.708 --> 38:52.667
No, no.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.708
That's alright.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.292
Let it go.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.917
[instrumental music]

39:03.333 --> 39:04.625
Commander Ivanova..

39:05.667 --> 39:06.917
...now that
it's been established

39:07.000 --> 39:09.625
that Dr. Jacobs is not

39:09.708 --> 39:12.208
and never has been
on Babylon 5

39:12.292 --> 39:13.417
I think we should do all we can

39:13.500 --> 39:15.042
to help out agent Cranston.

39:15.125 --> 39:17.667
Backtrack from Jacobs'
last known position

39:17.750 --> 39:20.875
determine which other ships
he might have..

39:20.958 --> 39:22.625
...might have boarded.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.833
Give him their
destinations, ETAs

39:24.917 --> 39:26.625
anything he wants.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.292
Mr. Cranston..

39:29.667 --> 39:32.083
...now that you've finished
turning my station upside down

39:32.167 --> 39:34.542
with this wild
goose chase of yours..

39:34.625 --> 39:35.917
...I expect you'll be leaving us

39:36.000 --> 39:38.583
as soon as you have
Ivanova's report.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.583
[instrumental music]

39:49.375 --> 39:50.708
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

39:50.792 --> 39:51.917
Commander, how could you even

39:52.000 --> 39:54.375
suggest such a thing?

39:54.458 --> 39:56.458
- A foolish thought.
- Oh.

39:56.542 --> 39:59.458
Well, I'll forgive it..

39:59.542 --> 40:01.208
...this time.

40:03.875 --> 40:06.292
[instrumental music]

40:08.792 --> 40:10.958
[beeps]

40:11.042 --> 40:12.958
Oh, doctor. Good.

40:13.042 --> 40:14.708
You've got everything, I assume.

40:14.792 --> 40:16.417
Ready when you are.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.000
[music continues]

40:30.875 --> 40:32.167
So what do we do now?

40:33.500 --> 40:36.000
He said wait
until it recognizes us.

40:38.583 --> 40:40.292
Look.

40:40.375 --> 40:43.292
[music continues]

40:43.375 --> 40:44.458
How does it know?

40:44.542 --> 40:45.792
The same reason our scanners

40:45.875 --> 40:48.167
indicated one alien life form

40:48.250 --> 40:50.708
when Kosh wasn't around.

40:50.792 --> 40:52.583
It's what we've suspected
all along

40:52.667 --> 40:54.167
but could never prove.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.750
The Vorlons use
organic technology.

40:58.292 --> 41:00.375
That's a living ship.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.875
Conscious.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.250
Aware.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.500
[instrumental music]

41:25.417 --> 41:27.292
Now, this should bring him out
of the artificial coma

41:27.375 --> 41:28.750
anytime now.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.208
I hated to do it,
but if the only way

41:30.292 --> 41:32.125
Kosh would allow a human
inside his ship

41:32.208 --> 41:34.667
was in an unconscious state.

41:34.750 --> 41:37.208
Uh.. Oh.

41:37.292 --> 41:39.250
Dr. Jacobs, are you alright?

41:39.333 --> 41:42.458
Oh, yes, yes. Fine.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.917
You know what was strange?

41:45.000 --> 41:48.417
While I was asleep, the, uh..

41:48.500 --> 41:50.208
...the ship, it..

41:50.292 --> 41:52.583
...it sang to me.

41:52.667 --> 41:54.458
[instrumental music]

41:59.125 --> 42:00.583
Do you have it?

42:03.208 --> 42:05.167
Right here.

42:05.250 --> 42:06.958
His testimony..

42:07.042 --> 42:09.000
...records..

42:09.083 --> 42:10.333
...all of it.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.250
Good.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.250
It's not enough
to go public with yet

42:18.333 --> 42:19.792
but it's a start.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.708
We'll get Jacobs
on to one of our ships

42:23.792 --> 42:25.917
as soon as possible.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.833
Thank you again for your help.

42:29.250 --> 42:30.458
You've just scored
a major victory

42:30.542 --> 42:32.125
for the good guys.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.708
You should be proud.

42:35.333 --> 42:36.750
Until next time, captain.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.958
There's always a next time,
isn't there?

42:39.042 --> 42:41.250
'You better pray it stays
that way, captain.'

42:41.333 --> 42:43.292
Because as long
as there is a next time

42:43.375 --> 42:46.542
at least there's a chance
we'll win..

42:46.625 --> 42:48.500
...because in this war,
captain..

42:50.167 --> 42:52.708
...we need all the chances
we can get.
