02:26.546 --> 02:27.706
Here's fine.

02:42.529 --> 02:43.791
Really?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.724
I thought we'd grab a bite.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.158
You've an early start tomorrow.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.596
I want to drop by the store.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.668
Well... okay.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.802
Wait a second.

02:57.977 --> 02:58.966
Here.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.076
Huh?

03:00.313 --> 03:01.678
- Here.
- What is it?

03:16.963 --> 03:18.362
Work?

03:18.831 --> 03:20.492
Something wrong?

03:20.900 --> 03:22.060
No.

03:24.904 --> 03:26.394
Your wife, right?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.870
"Ex-wife," okay?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.435
Next month, you'll be my wife.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.510
So don't talk like that.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.541
Sorry.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.311
What's your "ex-wife" want?

03:40.753 --> 03:43.017
She's been pestering me

03:43.256 --> 03:44.689
to call lately.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.926
Then go talk to her.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.757
You haven't told her about us.

03:56.469 --> 03:57.800
You're right.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.032
I will.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.170
Open that.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.502
Okay.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.583
That's for helping with

04:17.824 --> 04:19.519
today's exhibit.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.320
Thanks.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.299
Good luck, tomorrow.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.401
I'll root from the office.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.626
Huh?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.467
That's weird.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.610
Ow.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.608
Hi...
Isn't it a little late to be out?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.475
You okay?

07:32.718 --> 07:34.276
Yeah, I'm fine now.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.010
Sorry to worry you.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.587
See a doctor, anyway.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.758
Okay, thanks Miyuki.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.223
Sure. Oh, and congrats

07:43.463 --> 07:44.725
about Akira!

07:45.465 --> 07:47.763
You'd better come to the wedding.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.524
You bet! I plan on giving

07:49.769 --> 07:51.760
a speech, too.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.335
Watch what you say.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.938
Like... how he hid the fact

07:57.176 --> 07:59.576
he was divorced?

07:59.812 --> 08:03.805
Yeah. He did, didn't he?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.510
Anyway, thanks.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.016
I'm all right now.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.247
Good. My bath is cold

08:12.492 --> 08:14.153
but I forgive you.

08:14.527 --> 08:18.224
I'll pass on a bath tonight, too.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.329
Well, good night.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.166
Your bath's ready.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.732
Who's there?

08:37.950 --> 08:38.609
Hello?

08:38.851 --> 08:39.317
Kanako?

08:39.552 --> 08:40.143
Akira!

08:40.620 --> 08:41.279
You at home?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.885
Yes but...

08:43.188 --> 08:44.246
Don't move!

08:44.490 --> 08:45.923
I'll be right over!

08:46.459 --> 08:47.221
It's her.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.119
Who?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.350
My ex!

08:49.595 --> 08:51.256
After I dropped you off...

08:51.497 --> 08:52.691
she suddenly showed up

08:52.932 --> 08:54.490
with a knife.

08:54.901 --> 08:55.993
Are you okay?

08:56.235 --> 08:57.827
Yeah. She grazed me.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.929
Then she ran off.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.873
Akira! Akira!

11:43.235 --> 11:45.533
Somebody! Help!

11:56.549 --> 11:57.641
What the!?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.024
"Out on patrol"

12:36.555 --> 12:38.216
What is that woman?

12:40.359 --> 12:41.986
What do I do?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.734
"Akira"

12:58.844 --> 13:01.711
You've reached voice mail

13:01.947 --> 13:03.642
for Akira Tasaki.

13:16.929 --> 13:17.725
Hello?

13:17.963 --> 13:18.725
Miyuki!

13:18.964 --> 13:19.896
Kanako!

13:20.132 --> 13:21.224
Where are you?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.230
Akira's looking for you!

13:23.469 --> 13:24.197
What?

13:24.503 --> 13:26.869
He says he's at your place.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.540
He keeps calling me because

13:29.775 --> 13:31.504
he can't find you.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.578
Miyuki!

13:43.289 --> 13:45.382
He says he's at your place.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.657
"Home"

13:57.269 --> 13:58.201
Kanako?

13:59.572 --> 14:00.698
Akira!

14:01.006 --> 14:02.166
Kanako?

14:04.510 --> 14:05.738
Kanako?

14:06.879 --> 14:07.846
- I'm at the police...

14:08.080 --> 14:09.479
- (Kanako?)

14:09.715 --> 14:12.149
Kanako? Kanako?

14:13.152 --> 14:15.518
Akira, are you there?

14:15.788 --> 14:30.226
Kanako? Kanako?

14:49.855 --> 14:51.152
Kanako?

15:08.807 --> 15:10.434
Kanako?

15:36.902 --> 15:40.030
Somebody! Help me!

15:40.272 --> 15:42.706
Please, anyone!

15:48.814 --> 15:50.145
Why?

16:10.769 --> 16:12.031
Help me!

16:13.505 --> 16:15.166
Please help me!

16:15.607 --> 16:16.699
I beg you!

16:16.942 --> 16:18.136
Please!

16:37.796 --> 16:39.263
You again!

16:51.877 --> 16:53.344
What's going on?

16:53.579 --> 16:55.046
Where'd you come from?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.979
Please, tell me!

17:18.936 --> 17:20.199
Look! Up there!

17:20.806 --> 17:21.897
There she is!

17:22.141 --> 17:23.574
Creepy!

17:24.108 --> 17:26.042
She stands there even in rain.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.643
I hear a child fell from there.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.215
Was it her child?

17:33.452 --> 17:34.510
I don't know.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.219
Go ask her.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.786
No way!

17:38.323 --> 17:38.948
I dare you.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.783
Don't tell me...

17:56.708 --> 17:59.142
it was you.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.147
Help!

23:15.660 --> 23:17.059
When I came to,

23:17.596 --> 23:19.962
I was in a hospital.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.833
It wasn't until much later

23:23.168 --> 23:25.636
that I heard about...

23:26.405 --> 23:28.305
the terror I'd been through.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.507
That night, after leaving Akira...

23:33.845 --> 23:35.710
I accidentally got in the way of

23:36.014 --> 23:38.414
a woman's suicide.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.087
The woman died.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.651
I miraculously survived

23:46.892 --> 23:48.757
but in critical condition.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.092
And then...

23:51.563 --> 23:52.928
they told me a part of her body...

23:53.331 --> 23:55.026
had fused with mine

23:55.267 --> 23:58.236
from the impact.

24:02.407 --> 24:06.104
The operation to sever the part

24:07.679 --> 24:09.169
took time.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.415
The woman remains unidentified.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.579
She had no personal effects...

24:14.820 --> 24:16.788
And her head was damaged

24:17.022 --> 24:19.149
beyond recognition.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.159
What had I seen?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.664
A dream emerging from the

24:32.904 --> 24:34.599
woman's hatred?

24:39.911 --> 24:42.106
Akira's ex-wife had been calling

24:42.347 --> 24:44.042
merely to say...

24:44.282 --> 24:47.683
that she, too, was remarrying.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.613
But the hatred I had felt seemed

24:53.558 --> 24:56.618
much more than a mere dream.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.762
Who was that woman?

25:06.137 --> 25:08.799
Why did she jump?

25:41.573 --> 25:42.904
All I can say is I was saved

25:43.608 --> 25:46.168
by that girl.

26:14.706 --> 26:16.333
That girl's mother stood here

26:17.309 --> 26:18.901
every day.

26:20.278 --> 26:21.711
Every day.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.621
Each day, I'd pass by here.

26:44.569 --> 26:48.164
I wonder how she must've felt...

26:49.107 --> 26:50.574
staring down at that spot

26:50.809 --> 26:53.676
each and every day...

26:55.647 --> 26:56.807
as people with oblivious

26:57.048 --> 26:59.642
expressions shuffled past it.

27:38.923 --> 27:40.686
God, don't do that!

27:41.559 --> 27:43.618
You almost gave me a heart attack.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.857
You've heard the rumors, right?

27:48.033 --> 27:49.625
I moved here because

27:50.502 --> 27:51.332
it was cheap but...

27:51.569 --> 27:52.729
apparently the child next door

27:52.971 --> 27:54.097
fell to her death.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.465
After that her mother just stood

27:55.707 --> 27:58.835
there staring, just like you were.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.377
It gave me such chills when I

28:01.613 --> 28:03.740
heard about it.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.309
You a friend of theirs?

28:07.919 --> 28:09.113
No.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.449
But where is the mother?

28:12.691 --> 28:13.919
She ultimately committed

28:14.159 --> 28:16.286
suicide.

28:17.562 --> 28:18.927
What? When?

28:19.164 --> 28:21.132
The superintendent would know

28:21.366 --> 28:22.458
but I hear she...

28:22.701 --> 28:24.999
hung herself at her parents' home.

28:25.236 --> 28:28.171
A year ago... or maybe two.

28:30.241 --> 28:31.538
Hung herself?

28:31.776 --> 28:34.540
Yes. Tragic, huh?

28:34.779 --> 28:36.178
God, I'd like to move.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.708
Wait.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.511
She didn't jump to her death?

28:40.752 --> 28:42.310
Please don't remind me.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.521
Someone did jump from

28:43.755 --> 28:45.450
here recently.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.490
Yuk!

28:51.262 --> 28:52.661
Hung herself?

28:53.498 --> 28:55.227
Then who was that woman?

28:58.303 --> 28:59.668
If the lady who jumped...

29:01.206 --> 29:02.764
was not the child's mom...

29:04.642 --> 29:06.542
who was she?

29:25.396 --> 29:27.864
Are you the girl's mother?

29:28.299 --> 29:29.823
Run away!

29:54.058 --> 29:56.049
Then, who's this?

30:55.286 --> 30:56.844
What are you?

30:58.890 --> 31:01.450
I'm... a... monster!

31:27.752 --> 31:30.312
Unholy Women

Tasuku Emoto

Nahana

32:43.227 --> 32:46.594
Teruyuki Kagawa

32:52.337 --> 33:00.972
Hagane(Steel)

34:03.841 --> 34:05.172
Good morning.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.445
I'll be going.

34:45.683 --> 34:46.945
Wait. Have a drink.

34:48.985 --> 34:50.179
Drink up.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.447
Must be lonely working alone.

34:56.527 --> 34:57.789
I know it's tough.

34:58.896 --> 35:01.296
I appreciate what you're doing.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.131
Let's drink to it.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.793
What?

35:06.037 --> 35:08.437
To you... To all your

35:08.673 --> 35:10.140
hard work.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.833
No... I mean, why?

35:15.146 --> 35:16.306
Why not?

35:17.615 --> 35:20.379
Well, I'm under-aged.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.442
Don't be like that.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.777
You're such a bore.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.921
Fine... go home.

35:35.266 --> 35:35.925
Hey, I'm sorry.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.065
You mad?

35:37.502 --> 35:38.730
No.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.704
You just surprised me.

35:42.573 --> 35:43.801
You're so serious.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.565
You seemed offended.

35:47.278 --> 35:50.145
You got any time tomorrow?

35:50.848 --> 35:51.780
What?

35:53.384 --> 35:55.648
This is my sister.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.623
Would you mind taking her out?

36:01.859 --> 36:02.791
What?

36:03.227 --> 36:04.455
Why not?

36:05.029 --> 36:06.360
She's cute, isn't she?

36:07.798 --> 36:09.459
Take her somewhere.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.637
Use this customer's car.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.103
You wanna drive it, don't you?

36:18.743 --> 36:20.210
Our address.

36:22.046 --> 36:23.638
See you in the morning.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.777
Come on. Live a little.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.552
Not interested?

36:36.627 --> 36:38.959
I am but...

36:42.967 --> 36:45.527
are you sure want me for this?

36:51.442 --> 36:52.841
Tomorrow morning.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.824
Hello?

38:44.488 --> 38:45.887
She likes to sew.

38:46.457 --> 38:47.856
Girls like that stuff.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.002
That's our mom...

39:05.076 --> 39:06.737
died giving birth to her.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.735
So I raised her myself...

39:09.980 --> 39:12.448
my little sister Hagane.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.480
You don't want to hear this.

39:17.421 --> 39:19.616
Hagane, go get ready.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.786
Why is it that women

39:27.031 --> 39:29.556
take so long...

39:30.501 --> 39:32.731
getting ready to go out?

39:58.863 --> 40:00.023
All right.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.230
She's all yours.

40:03.501 --> 40:04.934
Um... boss?

40:11.175 --> 40:15.111
This photo...

40:15.679 --> 40:16.771
Yeah?

40:18.215 --> 40:20.012
I mean...

40:20.484 --> 40:21.712
who is she?

40:21.952 --> 40:23.317
My sister.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.380
Yes but... um...

40:28.058 --> 40:29.650
Listen to me, Sekiguchi.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.287
I'm putting my trust in you.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.464
Got it?

40:38.068 --> 40:40.263
If anything happens to her...

40:41.672 --> 40:43.105
I'll kill ya.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.438
Come on, I'm only kidding.

42:19.236 --> 42:20.669
Ouch!

42:24.375 --> 42:26.138
Oh, no... you serious?

42:26.911 --> 42:28.276
Damn it.

42:44.461 --> 42:45.485
You all right?

44:01.171 --> 44:05.198
Pardon me for asking but...

44:06.610 --> 44:08.669
why do you?

44:08.912 --> 44:11.244
I mean, that bag...

44:12.516 --> 44:14.780
No, wait. I'm sorry!

44:15.019 --> 44:16.452
Forgive me.

44:17.688 --> 44:19.349
I'm not a good talker.

44:20.524 --> 44:21.991
Please.

44:31.635 --> 44:33.034
Wait!

44:44.782 --> 44:46.044
Are you okay?

45:49.847 --> 45:53.010
All I have are garbage bags

45:53.584 --> 45:55.518
and my underwear but...

46:07.664 --> 46:09.256
You'll catch a cold.

46:36.293 --> 46:39.820
That... hurts.

47:09.726 --> 47:28.442
"More"

48:30.908 --> 48:32.273
Can I...

48:32.509 --> 48:37.412
untie this string?

49:14.885 --> 49:16.250
Stop!

49:16.486 --> 49:17.418
I'm sorry!

49:17.654 --> 49:18.985
I'm sorry!

50:14.044 --> 50:15.272
Hagane?

50:18.048 --> 50:20.846
Hi, it's Takahashi.

50:22.352 --> 50:23.649
Thanks for today.

50:25.555 --> 50:27.147
How're you doing?

50:29.159 --> 50:30.387
I'm amazed.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.526
Hagane took a real

50:33.764 --> 50:35.925
liking to you.

50:37.667 --> 50:40.329
Maybe someday soon you'll

50:40.904 --> 50:42.769
be calling me "big brother."

50:45.242 --> 50:46.607
But all joking aside...

50:48.478 --> 50:49.968
I hope we can do this again.

50:50.914 --> 50:52.541
Well... bye.

50:55.352 --> 50:58.685
If we don't wash every

50:58.922 --> 51:01.618
little nook and cranny...

51:01.992 --> 51:03.755
dirt will build up, right?

51:07.597 --> 51:11.397
We don't want that.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.561
See that? See all that mud?

51:14.938 --> 51:16.030
Phew, that reeks! We don't

51:16.273 --> 51:17.706
want to scare him off.

51:21.178 --> 51:22.270
What?

51:24.014 --> 51:26.778
You like him that much, huh?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.888
Hagane, stop that.

51:34.324 --> 51:35.723
Cut it out.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.563
I said, stop!

51:52.709 --> 51:54.142
You freak.

52:04.454 --> 52:05.853
Sekiguchi?

52:13.797 --> 52:15.560
"I've returned the car.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.063
I'm sorry."

54:36.573 --> 54:46.539
"More"

55:04.901 --> 55:06.391
No.

55:08.371 --> 55:10.100
Leave me alone.

56:19.943 --> 56:21.774
Sekiguchi, you in?

56:27.217 --> 56:28.912
Please, open up.

56:39.496 --> 56:40.793
Sekiguchi.

56:41.097 --> 56:42.530
Sekiguchi.

56:43.967 --> 56:46.595
Ow... I'm stuck.

56:50.373 --> 56:51.601
You're the only one

56:51.875 --> 56:53.399
I can count on.

57:04.554 --> 57:06.078
I'll wait for you.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.756
Come back to work, okay?

57:13.196 --> 57:14.663
I'll drop by later.

59:19.322 --> 59:20.380
I'm sorry.

59:23.226 --> 59:25.285
Forgive me.

59:25.962 --> 59:27.657
Please...

59:29.732 --> 59:32.223
I don't wanna die.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.382
Are you crying?

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.070
I'm sorry.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.821
Ow! Ah!

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:39.426
Ouch!

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.455

Rock yourself to slumber

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:28.700
Rocking rocking

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:35.975
There's a good child

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.640
Go to sleep

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:49.015
Let go your tether

01:08:49.925 --> 01:09:01.200

Michio, it'll be dark soon.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:16.904
Come on.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:20.774
Let's take a taxi, mom.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:24.281
There aren't any.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.088
Look, a taxi!

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.723
Gotcha.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.361
I used to play here

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.967
when I was a girl.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.045
Plus, I've friends.

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.272
I'm sure I can find

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.109
some work here.

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.178
It's a good environment

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.049
for Michio.

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.785
You chose to divorce.

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:10.694
You broke up your family.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.162
How's that good for him?

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.074
And you're not well.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.279
Take Michio.

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:33.418
Hurry back to Tokyo!

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:38.653
It's not like I wanted to

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.725
come back here.

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.113
Michio?

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.413
Michio?

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.659
Did you get lost?

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:22.825
Who's that?

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:32.204
My older brother, Masahiko.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.074
Your uncle.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.405
Can a child be an uncle?

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.880
Masahiko... disappeared

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.954
when he was seven.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.384
You mean died?

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.493
No, he went missing.

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.366
He might still be alive.

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.241
He is.

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.140
What?

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.510
I just saw him.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.050
You're silly.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.239
Don't say that to grandma.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:04.625
Hey, Saeko!

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.259
Welcome back.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:11.038
It's me... Kajibo.

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:13.801
Kaji?

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:15.971
Didn't you hear?

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.111
I'm a social worker.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:21.874
Come here.

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.547
Come.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.864
Candy!

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.899
Aren't you cute!

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.351
Who's this?

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:04.683
That's me... your grandma.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:11.829
Will mom get like you, too?

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.940
Happy to see your grandson?

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.307
You can't live in the dark like this.

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:31.644
Let some light in.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.352
It'll happen again.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.844
Michio?

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.745
Michio?

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:07.983
Michio?

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.551
Michio?

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:38.548
Michio?

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.028
Stop fooling around.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:52.058
Michio?

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.508
Mom, you're smoking.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.427
Hurry or you'll be late

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.224
for school.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.247
Mom?

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:03.424
I remembered something...

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.485
about Masahiko's disappearance.

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.691
You were in the shed.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.638
I got up in the middle of night...

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.399
and saw him go inside it.

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.740
I won't have you...

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.009
talking nonsense.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:45.928
Mom?

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.858
You saw "it", didn't you?

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.182
Watch your step now.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.717
Here, you're home.

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:45.186
Thanks. I'll be fine.

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:47.427
Michio, take over for me.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.807
Hi, Mom.

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:10.911
Michio.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.546
What?

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.650
You sleep here alone tonight.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.077
Mom, toilet!

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.844
Mom?

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.617
Mom!

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.255
Mom!

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.397
Mom, toilet!

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.800
Mom!

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:34.132
Sleep my child

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:46.710
There's a good child

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:54.382
Go to sleep

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:08.200
Let go your tether

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:13.401
Now where have you gone?

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.288
How's school?

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:04.825
Was it Yoji?

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.058
The friend you made.

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.432
Invite him over.

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:22.206
Mom?

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.106
Yes?

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.642
Are you a "loony?"

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.611
Now who said that?

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:37.084
Yoji.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.786
He called us a "house of loonies."

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.389
Grandma's a "loony," too.

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:48.633
That's very mean.

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.127
Of course we're not.

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.042
What were you doing

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:03.273
in the shed?

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.151
The shed?

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.748
I wasn't there.

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.524
- What did you see?
- Michio!

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:18.532
Why are lying, Mom?

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.166
Hey, Michio.

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.468
Need a lift home?

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.942
What've you got there?

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.774
- Let me see.
- No!

01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:12.578
Come on.

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:13.650
What?

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:15.412
Let me see.

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.329
A kid at school?

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.539
Then who?

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.345
Mom.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.781
She wouldn't do that.

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.135
Hello? Koichi-san?

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:11.070
It's me, Saeko's mother.

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:15.511
Come take Michio away from here.

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.412
Right away!

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.714
If you don't hurry, it'll be too late.

01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:27.350
Please!

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:36.530
Mother?

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.864
I'm not letting Michio go.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:48.473
I was so worried about you.

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.045
Saeko...

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.016
his neck.

01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:01.095
Do you think I would

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:02.853
do this to my son?

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.661
Michio,

01:30:07.468 --> 01:30:09.459
did I do this to you?

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.272
Answer me, Michio.

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.333
I did it.

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.909
I did it to myself.

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:24.011
Wait.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.651
Michio...

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:28.451
it's a terrible thing to lie.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.385
Apologize to Kaji-san.

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:39.389
I'm sorry.

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:45.466
I'll take it from here.

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.839
Thank you.

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:19.633
Mom?

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:23.541
Yes, dear?

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.838
Can I sleep with you tonight?

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:43.426
No.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:44.898
No!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.592
No!

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:52.366
Let me out!

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.931
Let me out, Mom!

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:57.268
Let me out!

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.440
Mom!

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.315
Let me out!

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.639
"Police baffled by boy's disappearance"

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.877
"Empty casket funeral held"

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.883
"He's been spirited away?"

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:17.865
Michio, you must escape!

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.432
No.

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.665
If you don't, your mother...

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:23.899
your mother will...

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.271
Mom!

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.842
Mom!

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.076
Your mother will kill you.

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:31.809
Mom!

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.244
Mom!

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.015
Mom!

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:38.117
Mom!

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.016
Your mom...

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:49.692
understands your grandma now.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.000
She wanted to be with

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:56.260
her son forever.

01:37:58.606 --> 01:37:59.903
Michio.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.633
Let's stay together.

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:10.514
Come.

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:27.730
Michio.

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:35.200
Michio.

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:43.841
Michio.

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:50.918
Michio.

01:38:51.492 --> 01:39:00.764
Michio...

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:12.941
Michio...

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:18.844
Michio...

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:22.579
Michio.

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.193
Michio.

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.271
I'm sorry.

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.305
Mom...

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.640
Good morning.
