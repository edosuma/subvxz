14:32.572 --> 14:33.706
That's what I like.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.008
Never!

14:35.075 --> 14:37.344
Lerigot holds the only key
to free Maligore,

14:37.410 --> 14:38.912
the great flame
of destruction

14:38.979 --> 14:40.880
and my husband to be.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.449
Once we are wed,

14:42.515 --> 14:46.019
I will use his powers to raid
all the riches of the universe.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.922
Ooh. Thinking about it
just gives me goose bumps.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.490
Kind of give me gas.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.458
[Pffft]

14:51.524 --> 14:52.592
Sorry!

14:52.659 --> 14:55.528
On Earth, you will have
the capture of 2 humans

14:55.595 --> 14:57.097
of purity and strength.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.966
They'll be my dowry
to Maligore.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.567
Activate
the barrier shields

15:00.633 --> 15:02.302
and set a course
to Earth.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.437
We're going after
Lerigot.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.505
[Squeals]

15:05.572 --> 15:06.940
Prepare
to teleport.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.961
Announcer: Now batting
for the All-Stars,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.163
Kevin Olive!

15:31.698 --> 15:33.633
Yeah!

15:36.703 --> 15:38.638
Hey, hold it.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.273
What do you got there?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.809
Just as I thought.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.411
What is this huh?
Huh?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.346
I'll have to check these
hot dogs for safety.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.914
Man: Bulkmeyer!
Skullovitch!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.449
Beat it, kid. Mmm.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.020
Sir.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.555
Men, listen up,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.957
because you know how
I hate to repeat myself.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.393
I hate to repeat myself.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.661
Just did, sir.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.666
I needn't remind you
of our luck in getting rehired.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.435
Men,

16:08.501 --> 16:10.637
I have an important
assignment for you.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.340
It's an easy one,
but one that will, uh--

16:13.406 --> 16:15.808
Skullovitch,
are you listening to me?!

16:15.875 --> 16:17.510
With you, sir.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.878
Well, listen to this:

16:18.945 --> 16:20.313
Precisely at 1900 hours,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.215
you will relieve me
of my duties

16:22.282 --> 16:24.051
at the International
Dance-A-Thon.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.419
Do I make myself clear?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.287
Got it, sir!

16:27.354 --> 16:28.455
Yes, sir!

16:33.893 --> 16:36.463
Would you mind, sir?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.298
Yeah.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.466
Thank you.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.869
Napkin.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.471
Got one, sir.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.139
Thanks.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.677
[Screeching]

16:56.949 --> 16:58.385
Wow.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.520
Reminds me of parts
of Australia.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.954
[Beeping]

17:02.021 --> 17:03.022
Got him.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.492
The signal's coming
from...

17:05.558 --> 17:07.026
that direction.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.429
Let's go find him.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.934
Tanya: Wow.
This is moving fast.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.769
Adam,
come check this out.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.872
You know that object
we've been tracking?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.007
Yeah?

17:21.074 --> 17:22.842
It just entered
the Earth's atmosphere.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.811
But it has some kind
of shield blocking its identity.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.347
It is likely the reason

17:27.414 --> 17:29.349
that Lerigot
has come to Earth.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.983
An evil energy
surrounds it.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.985
Man, I've got
a bad feeling about this.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.921
Hope Tommy and Kat
make it back soon.

17:34.987 --> 17:38.091
Lieutenant Stone is already
gonna kill us for being late,

17:38.158 --> 17:39.659
so turn right!

17:39.726 --> 17:40.693
Left.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.694
Left is north!

17:41.761 --> 17:42.895
North Star!

17:42.962 --> 17:44.797
Look at the stars there,
man!

17:44.864 --> 17:45.798
That star?

17:45.865 --> 17:46.933
That star.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.535
That star is moving!

17:48.601 --> 17:49.869
Can we make a wish?

17:49.936 --> 17:51.638
Aah!

17:51.704 --> 17:53.473
[Both Screaming]

17:58.445 --> 18:00.447
What the heck was that?!

18:00.513 --> 18:02.349
Oh, I don't know,
but keep going!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.716
The accelerator's stuck!

18:03.783 --> 18:04.584
Whoa, Skull.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.853
Skull, uh, wha--
S-Slow down, man!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.288
I'm trying!

18:08.355 --> 18:10.457
Skull, there's
a building up ahead!

18:10.523 --> 18:12.192
Oh!

18:12.259 --> 18:13.826
[Screaming]

18:23.303 --> 18:24.837
[Both Coughing]

18:25.938 --> 18:27.940

18:28.007 --> 18:29.876
[Loud Rumbling Overhead]

18:29.942 --> 18:30.877
Huh?!

18:30.943 --> 18:31.844

18:40.620 --> 18:42.689
[Both Screaming]

18:53.032 --> 18:54.867
[Locator Beeping]

18:58.070 --> 18:59.872
Lerigot's signal's
getting stronger.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.910
Tommy, do you mind
if we stop for a minute?

19:03.976 --> 19:04.877
[Exhales]

19:04.944 --> 19:05.978
You OK?

19:06.045 --> 19:07.947
Yeah. It's just hot
out here.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.582
I know.
Want some water?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.218
[Beep]

19:13.353 --> 19:15.422
Tommy: We still have a lot
of jungle to cover.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.457
Thanks.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.458
Yeah.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.930
Oh, man,
this heat's intense.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.850
Don't move.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.453

19:49.689 --> 19:50.857
jump away.

you can't find Lerigot?!

And are these my 2 humans
of purity and strength?!

22:54.106 --> 22:55.408
Yeah. Check them out.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.844
I even scrambled their brains
so they'd be easier
to deal with.

Ta-da!

What do you think?

Are you out of your mind?

23:05.485 --> 23:08.387

to woo Maligore...

not make him lose
his lunch!

one more chance.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.877
Oh, man.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.879
We're headed
in the right direction,

23:32.945 --> 23:34.881
but the signal's
getting fainter.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.050
He must be weakening
from the sun's heat.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.986
Tommy, we've got to hurry.

Thank you,

out of here.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.697

with Lerigot

25:30.763 --> 25:32.531
for teleportation.

[Screeching]

25:39.471 --> 25:40.640
Thank you.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.361
Whoo!

26:02.428 --> 26:03.562
Well,

26:03.630 --> 26:05.464
what do we have here?

26:05.531 --> 26:07.566
2 humans
ripe for the picking,

26:07.634 --> 26:10.336
and they're heading
our way. Ha ha ha ha.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.527
Uhh! Aah!

Mmm! Mmm!

26:53.846 --> 26:55.848

worthy of feeding
my fiance.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.686
Throw them
into the bilge

26:59.752 --> 27:01.788
where they'll stay fresh
for my beloved Maligore.

It'll be my pleasure.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

27:11.363 --> 27:16.102
Now, let's reel in that
little runt Lerigot.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.204
He's probably
with Zordon by now.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.706
Remove the mind block.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.574
We'll use his wife Yara
to contact them both.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.376
[Cooing]

27:32.551 --> 27:34.486
Is he going
to be all right?

27:34.553 --> 27:36.956
The sun has taken
its toll on him.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.926
But this should restore
his life force, for now.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.627
I wonder
who's after him.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.295
[Mumbling]

27:45.932 --> 27:47.599
What's happening
to him?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.035
Tommy, wait.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.670
Lerigot is receiving
a telepathic transmission

27:51.738 --> 27:54.506
that is obviously
upsetting him greatly.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.575
Zordon,
what should we do?

27:56.642 --> 27:59.846
Perhaps if we can find out
what he is receiving,
we can help him.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.148
Alpha, attach the cranial
transmission scanner

28:02.214 --> 28:04.851
and connect it
to the viewing globe.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.052
Alpha: Ai yi yi!

28:06.118 --> 28:08.120
Zordon, I know
you can hear me,

28:08.187 --> 28:09.521
so listen well.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.758
Lerigot must surrender.

28:11.824 --> 28:15.294
Say hello
to Lerigot's family.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.830
Yara, loving wife

28:17.897 --> 28:20.967

to little baby Bethel.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.570
Don't you just want to
pinch those adorable cheeks?

28:24.636 --> 28:25.671
Ai yi yi yi yi!

28:25.738 --> 28:27.373
Make it stop! Look
what it's doing to him.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.540
Ohh!

28:28.607 --> 28:29.909
Bring him to me.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.044
Oh, and by the way,

28:32.111 --> 28:34.113
as a token of
my appreciation,

28:34.180 --> 28:37.049
I'll spare a couple
of your favorite humans.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.451
They're certainly
not much to look at.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.987
But my sensors tell me

28:41.053 --> 28:43.422
they were once one of your, um,
what do you call them?

28:52.064 --> 28:55.034
Do what I say or it's lights out
for all of them.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.402
And Jason.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.970
Huh.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.009
Yara! Aah!

29:05.044 --> 29:06.112
Kim.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.146
Yeah?

29:07.213 --> 29:10.316
I think we're in
major trouble here.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.717
I'd say.

29:11.784 --> 29:14.086
I wish we could morph.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.424
Jason: Doesn't look like
there's any way out.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.426
Hola.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.394
Ja, guten tag.

29:23.830 --> 29:27.733
[Spanish Accent]
My name is Antonio Bandanna.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.767
Bulk?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.002
Skull?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.873
[German Accent]
You are speaking to us?

29:33.940 --> 29:38.244
Who is this Bulk
and Skull?

29:38.310 --> 29:40.312
Something is strange
with those two.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.514
Oh, you just
figured that one out?

29:42.581 --> 29:43.715
Ruff.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.317
Aha!

29:48.320 --> 29:50.656
[Cooing]

29:50.722 --> 29:52.724
[Cooing]

29:52.791 --> 29:55.061
They understand
each other.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.963
As good friends should.

29:57.029 --> 30:00.232
I don't understand it.
Why does Divatox want Lerigot?

30:00.299 --> 30:04.203
I believe that Divatox
plans to use Lerigot
and his golden key

30:04.270 --> 30:06.338
to pass through
the treacherous Nemesis Triangle

30:06.405 --> 30:07.773
into another dimension.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.775
Once there, she
will likely travel

30:09.842 --> 30:11.677
to the lost Island
of Muiranthias

30:11.743 --> 30:15.714
and attempt to join forces with
an evil creature named Maligore.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.683
Great. Then what?

30:17.749 --> 30:19.151
Then nothing
will be safe.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.453
Even the Zords would not
be enough to stop them.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.421
What? No!

30:22.488 --> 30:23.990
[Cooing]

30:24.056 --> 30:25.624
What's he doing?

30:25.691 --> 30:27.559
Ai yi yi!

30:27.626 --> 30:31.864
He is performing
the Liarian Prayer of Guidance.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.900
Lerigot is preparing
to surrender.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.535
But why? We can't
let him do that.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.304
It's his family,
Kat.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.139
We'd do the same
for each other.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.474
I just
hope they're OK.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.011
OK, listen. We'll get
Kim and Jason out of there,

30:45.077 --> 30:47.046
then we'll go after
Lerigot's family.

30:47.113 --> 30:50.049
Look, Kimberly and Jason
were Power Rangers once.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.418
If anyone can get
through it, they can.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.468
Careful.
Watch your step.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.004
Ohh. Uhh.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.675
Look,
there they are.

31:16.742 --> 31:20.012
Warriors,
let's move it!

31:22.949 --> 31:24.016
Move it!

31:24.083 --> 31:27.353
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

31:45.972 --> 31:47.539
Ha ha ha ha ha!

31:49.575 --> 31:51.944
Send Lerigot down!

31:52.011 --> 31:55.481
No! Bring our friends
closer first!

31:55.547 --> 31:56.882
Grrr!

31:56.949 --> 31:59.651
You have
no choice, humans!

31:59.718 --> 32:02.321
This is as close
as you get!

32:02.388 --> 32:04.023
Now, send
the wizard down!

32:04.090 --> 32:05.724
I don't like it.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.960
We should try to stall them
until we can figure
something out.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.963
Yeah, I think maybe
you're right.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.332
Lerigot's gone!

32:15.834 --> 32:17.336
Lerigot, no!

32:17.403 --> 32:18.704
Come back!

32:26.312 --> 32:29.448
Come on, furball,
come to Elgar. Ha ha ha ha.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.682
All right,

32:30.749 --> 32:32.918
you have
what you came for!

32:32.985 --> 32:34.386
Let our friends go!

32:34.453 --> 32:35.554
Swim for 'em!

32:35.621 --> 32:37.990
Arrivederci,
turkeys!

32:53.239 --> 32:55.141
Elgar: All right,
stop the boat!

32:55.207 --> 32:57.109
You can dump them out
right here!

32:57.176 --> 32:59.578
Ha ha ha ha ha!

32:59.645 --> 33:00.846
Ha ha ha ha ha!

33:00.912 --> 33:02.981
Ha ha ha!
Come and get 'em!

33:03.049 --> 33:05.684
All right, take us
back to the ship.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.058
Move it!

33:17.996 --> 33:20.032
I got to go after him.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.438
No, it's a fake!

33:26.505 --> 33:27.473
Tommy!

33:27.539 --> 33:29.608
I got to--
I got to check the other one!

33:29.675 --> 33:31.643
Tommy!

33:31.710 --> 33:33.011
Come on,
they're gone!

33:33.079 --> 33:34.880
Tommy, come on!

33:34.946 --> 33:35.981
Come on!

33:36.048 --> 33:37.383
They're gone.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.652
Come on, man,
they tricked us.

33:53.265 --> 33:56.202
Double, double,
rocks, and rubble!

33:57.503 --> 34:02.441
Mmm! Abracadabra cadabra
cadabra cadabra ooh!

34:02.508 --> 34:04.110
Ooh!

34:07.079 --> 34:09.947
Oh, if only its magic
would glow in my hands,

34:10.014 --> 34:12.618
I would have
no need for you.

34:12.684 --> 34:16.522
You will oversee
our safe passage
into the Nemesis Triangle,

34:16.588 --> 34:18.790
won't you, twerp?

34:18.857 --> 34:19.858
Ohh.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.860
Hmm!

34:21.927 --> 34:25.496
Set a course
for the Nemesis Triangle,
full speed ahead!

34:25.563 --> 34:27.366
[Cooing]

34:29.967 --> 34:31.469
Ohh. Ohh.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.505
Mmm.

34:33.572 --> 34:39.010
Kim: Once we get
to the Island of Muiranthias
on the other side...

34:39.077 --> 34:41.513
[Buzzing]

34:44.183 --> 34:46.217
As I was saying,

34:46.284 --> 34:48.520
once we get to
the Island of Muiran--

34:48.587 --> 34:49.721
[Buzzing]

35:04.370 --> 35:05.704
Mmm!

35:07.173 --> 35:10.309
My Maligore's
appetite will ignite,

35:10.376 --> 35:14.079
once he sees the powerlicious
offerings I brought him.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.182
Those 2 ex-power pukes

35:16.248 --> 35:19.351
will be the perfect wedding
meal for my Maligore.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.619
OK.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.522
This is so lame.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.458
You know, we come back here
to surprise everybody

35:26.525 --> 35:29.027
and help out
with the shelter,

35:29.094 --> 35:30.962
the next thing you know

35:31.029 --> 35:33.465
we're snack food
for some monster
with the munchies.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.568
Honk.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.005
Level stabilizer
is off 8.40.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.973
Full throttle
the power output.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.009
OK, all systems
go here.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.511
The Zords you
are now creating

35:45.577 --> 35:47.779
will posses the power
to carry you safely
on your quest

35:47.846 --> 35:49.448
to the Nemesis Triangle

35:49.515 --> 35:53.084
to rescue Lerigot,
his family, and our friends.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.455
Behold your
new Turbo Zords.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.123
Tanya: They're
just ordinary cars.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.259
[Engines Rev]

36:00.326 --> 36:03.729
Zordon: No, Tanya, they
are extraordinary cars,

36:03.795 --> 36:07.699
vehicles equipped
with the power and velocity
of turbo technology.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.270
Individually, they are
formidable fighting machines.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.904
But when merged together,

36:12.971 --> 36:14.406
they form
the Turbo Megazord,

36:14.473 --> 36:16.775
the most powerful Zord
ever created.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.017
Adam, Desert Thunder
will be yours to command.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.253
[Engine Revs]

36:27.319 --> 36:30.489
Katherine, yours
is called Wind Chaser.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.959
Tanya, Dune Star
is your Turbo Zord.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.128
And, Tommy,

36:37.195 --> 36:40.065
Red Lightning
will serve you well.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.300
Tommy:
Thanks, Zordon.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.369
Adam:
What about Rocky's?

36:43.435 --> 36:47.373
Zordon: The Mountain Blaster
will stay behind for now.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.575
Alpha:
Remember, Rangers,

36:49.641 --> 36:51.710
once inside
the Nemesis Triangle,

36:51.777 --> 36:55.247
communication
with the power chamber
will be impossible.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.450
Zordon: Before you
are your new turbo morphers,

36:58.517 --> 37:01.420
five keys similar to
Lerigot's golden key.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.822
Individually, they will
power up your vehicles

37:03.889 --> 37:06.725
and give you access
to your morphing powers.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.827
But together,
and only together,

37:08.894 --> 37:11.963
will they be powerful enough
to see you safely through
your mission.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.032
Now, reach out, Rangers,

37:14.099 --> 37:16.101
and accept your destiny.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.670
Ready?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.272
Ready.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.844
Go!

37:33.285 --> 37:36.322
Whoa! I've never felt
anything like this.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.324
Wow! This is great!

37:38.390 --> 37:39.858
All right!

37:39.925 --> 37:41.159
This is awesome!

37:41.226 --> 37:43.462
Whoa, this
is incredible!

37:43.529 --> 37:45.764
All right, guys,
let's go to work.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.098
Right behind you.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.199
Wait for me.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.601
Let's do it!

37:50.836 --> 37:52.237
All systems check out.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.106
Your Zords are programmed
and ready to go.

37:55.173 --> 37:58.243
Zordon: Take your Zords across
the great desert to the sea.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.278
There you will find
the Ghost Galleon,

38:00.346 --> 38:02.581
a phantom ship which
will take you and the Zords

38:02.648 --> 38:03.815
through
the Nemesis Triangle.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.817
You must merge
the power of your keys

38:05.884 --> 38:08.487
the moment you cross
into the triangle.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.656
Zordon: The combined power
of your keys and the Galleon

38:10.722 --> 38:12.257
will see you
through safely.

38:12.324 --> 38:15.994
Neither the ship nor your Zords
will be detectable by Divatox.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.330
Ai yi yi!
Good luck, Rangers.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.631
Thanks, Alpha.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.400
Zordon: Good luck.
And may the power protect you.

38:21.467 --> 38:22.401
All right, Rangers,
power up!

38:22.468 --> 38:23.602
- Right!
- Right!

38:42.020 --> 38:44.356
* Go *

38:44.423 --> 38:45.691
* Go *

38:45.757 --> 38:47.459
* Power Rangers
turbo, go *

38:47.526 --> 38:49.761
Tommy: Oh, man!

38:49.828 --> 38:51.397
This is awesome!

38:51.463 --> 38:53.198
Desert Thunder
ready to rumble.

38:53.264 --> 38:54.566
Wind Chaser
ready to howl.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.502
Dune Star's gonna shine.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.470
Red Lightning
ready to bolt.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.971
Adam:
All systems go, Tommy.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.609
All right,
let's rip some velocity.
Shift into turbo.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.144
Whoo!

39:06.211 --> 39:11.016
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

39:11.082 --> 39:12.451
By accepting
this honor,

39:12.518 --> 39:15.687
you are also accepting
a great responsibility.

39:15.754 --> 39:19.290
As the newest Ranger, you must
take your lead from the others

39:19.357 --> 39:21.793
and learn to use
your new powers wisely.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.462
You will command
the Mountain Blaster

39:23.529 --> 39:26.665
and be henceforth known
as the Blue Ranger.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.735
Good luck and
may the power protect you.

39:37.743 --> 39:41.146
Ha! No Power Rangers
in sight.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.215
I knew Zordon would get it
through his thick skull

39:44.282 --> 39:46.151
not to mess with me.

39:46.217 --> 39:50.055
I'm no veterinarian, but I,
uh, think it's dying.

39:50.121 --> 39:53.492
Oh, we can't let that precious
little Liarian thingy die

39:53.559 --> 39:57.663
before he opens the gateway
to Muiranthias
and frees my betrothed.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.466
[Cooing]

40:29.528 --> 40:32.197
You guys,
I hear the ocean,

40:32.263 --> 40:35.400
but, uh, I don't
see the ship.

40:35.467 --> 40:38.069
I'll take a look
up ahead.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.771
Think I found it.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.011
Uhh, the Ghost Galleon.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.913
It's amazing.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.018
Tommy: Hey, guys,
check it out.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.700
Rocky?

41:10.168 --> 41:12.738
Wow, cool!

41:13.939 --> 41:15.907
Justin, what are
you doing here?

41:15.974 --> 41:18.276
Rocky couldn't make it,
so he sent me.

41:18.343 --> 41:19.645
What are you
talking about?

41:19.711 --> 41:21.847
Guys, I'm the new
Blue Ranger.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.715
Isn't that cool
or what?

41:25.483 --> 41:26.585
What?

41:26.652 --> 41:28.920
Man, I was afraid I
wasn't going to make it.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.557
Alpha had to give me a
crash course in driving.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.792
Good thing you don't need
a license to drive a zord.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.327
So what
are we doing here?

41:36.394 --> 41:37.796
- Huh?
- Uhh!

41:39.097 --> 41:41.667
We'll, uh, we'll
talk about this later.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.135
Right now, we got to get
those cars on that ship.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.637
Let's go.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.419
OK, everybody on board?

42:01.486 --> 42:02.821
Yep, we're all here.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.590
Let's check out the ship.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.065
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

42:34.552 --> 42:36.955
Hey, you guys,
look at this!

42:41.960 --> 42:44.696
Kat: I guess
we should open it.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.005
Looks like the portal keys

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:13.757
Kim, you got
to fight the evil.

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.792
Evil is
like evil does.

01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:17.894
Don't do this!
Oh!

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.000
Leave her alone.
Kimberly, no!

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:30.106
No. Look at me,
Kim. Look at me!

01:18:30.173 --> 01:18:33.176
It's me.

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:34.043
It's me, Tommy.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:35.644
Yes, we're
your friends.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.747
Friends?

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.449
I don't have
any friends.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.219
- [Growls]
- Wait!

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:47.456
Oh, yeah, and sweetie...
pink is out.

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:54.563
Come on, Ranger!

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:56.866
No. I don't want
to hurt you.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.078
[Growls]

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.489
Aah!

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:24.460
Into the fire.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:25.594
Into the fire.

01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:27.763
Do it! Do it!

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:29.432
Maligore's power
will exceed.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:30.733
Throw him
in the fire!

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.503
No! This one
is mine! Grr!

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.977
Throw him in the fire!
Throw him in the fire!

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.379
Yes...into the fire.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.949
[Cooing]

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:50.086
Oh!

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.458
Huh!

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:59.896
Now I'm the one with the muscles
and the power! Grr!

01:19:59.963 --> 01:20:01.264
Yeah, that's right,
Jason.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.901
But you're not using
your brain power.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.137
Aah!

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.772
Hold on!

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.574
Come on!

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.742
Tommy, hang on!

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.445
Come on, Jason.
Don't fight me!

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:20.049
You got to remember.
Remember all the good.

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:24.620
Got it! Come on!

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:26.655
No!

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:28.191
Oh!

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.026
- Are you all right, Kim?
- I'm with you.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.595
Come on!

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:46.209
I think you're
going to need this.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:47.877
Yeah, thanks.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.246
It's back to action!

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.016
I'll get
the Liarians.

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:55.318
Right! Let's finish up,
guys!

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.491
Watch it, you big
Christmas tree ornament.

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:03.392
Sorry about that.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:07.363
Maligore, arise
and meet your bride.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:10.233
Together we will
exact revenge on Lerigot...

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:12.568
descendant of those
who have imprisoned you.

01:21:12.635 --> 01:21:14.337
Come to me...

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:15.538
please!

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:16.705
Oh, come on.

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:18.474
The humans are
turning pure again.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.209
- Grr!
- No!

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:23.779
Now we don't have
a sacrifice.

01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:25.581
Oh, but we do,
dear nephew.

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:27.350
We do?

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:29.118
Mm-hmm.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:33.689
Aah!

01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:37.826
Remind me to get
another pet.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.028
Aah!

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:46.035
Uh-oh.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:57.981
Out of my face.

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:01.985
Excuse me.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.355
Why, thank you.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.590
Any time.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:18.001
Man, tough room.

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:23.106
Ah, straighten up.
He's coming.

01:22:24.107 --> 01:22:26.275
I don't think
I like this one bit.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:33.682
Come to me, Maligore.

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:36.519
Unite our powers as one!

01:22:43.026 --> 01:22:44.260
Whoa.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.239
Get ready
to take this freak.

01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:04.313
He's ba-a-a-ck.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.452
She wants to marry him?

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:14.690
You sure about this?

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:16.325
Justin: I think it's time
to break out the hardware.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:18.527
Good call.
Let's do it!

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:25.901
Grrr!

01:23:25.968 --> 01:23:27.736
Heh heh heh heh.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:28.904
Turbo lightning sword!

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:30.639
Turbo hand blasters!

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:32.007
Turbo star chargers!

01:23:32.075 --> 01:23:35.078
Rarrr!

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:37.680
Talk to him.

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.082
Turbo thunder cannon!

01:23:39.148 --> 01:23:40.916
Turbo wind fire!

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:44.287
You look...great.

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.954
Haven't changed
a bit.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:50.025
Aah!

01:23:50.093 --> 01:23:51.760
Fire!

01:23:58.801 --> 01:24:00.169
It's not working.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:03.806
What a hothead.

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:07.376
What's the plan,
Tommy?

01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:09.044
That barely
fazed him.

01:24:09.112 --> 01:24:12.014
We've got to lead
brimstone breath outside.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:13.882
All right! I was hoping
you'd say that.

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.184
Let's do it!

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:29.132
Adam, get up.

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:33.336
Ah, man, I can't move.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.003
Come on, you can do it.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.839
Hey, your bride's leaving.

01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:40.309
I think I hear
my mother calling.

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:42.511
Made you look.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.979
You have the worst
sense of direction,

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:45.681
and you're ugly.

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.155
Everyone,
out the way we came.

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:54.123
- Adam, can you make it?
- Yeah.

01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:55.691
OK, let's go!

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.092
Move it!

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.727
Are you OK?

01:24:58.794 --> 01:25:00.196
Whoo!

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.601
We got to get out of here.
The place is going to blow up.

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:06.669
Come on!

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:07.636
Come on!

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:08.637
Move. Come on!

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.105
Come on. Be careful.

01:25:10.173 --> 01:25:11.874
Come on. Come on.
Here we go.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:46.975
Head for the clearing!

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:48.777
You got it!
Right behind you.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:49.745
Copy that.

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.247
Ya-hoo!

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:06.862
You're going on a diet,
buddy, the minute we get back.

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:09.298
Come on! We're going
to miss the whole fight.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.276
Grrr!

01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:22.177
Let's see what
this baby's got.

01:26:22.245 --> 01:26:24.146
Ready to bring them
together.

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:25.381
Wind Chaser ready!

01:26:25.448 --> 01:26:26.982
- Ready!
- Ready!

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:28.517
Do it!

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.387
Turbo Megazord
morph seats on-line.

01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:38.527
Powering up
the turbo shield armor now.

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:40.296
Desert Thunder
is ready to rock!

01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:41.930
Dune Star is right there
with you.

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:43.165
This is awesome!

01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:45.334
Mountain Blaster here.
I'm ready, too!

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.344
Initiate
docking sequence now.

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:05.388
* Go *

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:07.656
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.858
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.561
Mountain Blaster's
lined up and coming in.

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:28.944
Red Lightning coming in
for final docking sequence.

01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:34.683
* Go *

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.420
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:27:37.486 --> 01:27:40.088

01:27:40.155 --> 01:27:42.358

Megazord turbo charge!

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:12.588
- Ready!
- Ready!

01:28:12.655 --> 01:28:13.722
Let's take care
of business.

01:28:20.496 --> 01:28:22.865
Let's get him!

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.040
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.141
That was close.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:36.545
Maligore! Win this one
for me, babe!

01:28:44.487 --> 01:28:46.054
- We got him.
- All right!

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:06.041
Yeah!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.128
Ready to fly?

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.129
Ready!

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.230
All right!

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.131
Engage mega turbo jets!
Now!

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:35.370
Turbo jets full power!

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:46.682
Later, flame face!

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:04.032
Ya-hoo!

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:05.968
We did it!

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:07.903
Yes! Yes!

01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:16.445
The volcano,
it's erupting.

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:17.379
We better get out of here.

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:19.482
Oh, my plan!

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:21.450
The money!
The jewels!

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:23.385
The plastic surgery.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:26.455
I didn't even get
a honeymoon!

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:30.659
You mark my word,
Rygog.

01:30:30.726 --> 01:30:33.462
The Power Rangers
will pay for this one day.

01:30:33.529 --> 01:30:35.864
I never accept defeat.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.566
Right. No defeat.

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:38.667
So what do we do now?

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.906
Run!

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:44.873
Right!

01:30:46.108 --> 01:30:49.211
I want my mommy!
Move it!

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.230
All right!

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.431
Hey, guys!

01:31:09.498 --> 01:31:11.066
How about a lift?

01:31:18.373 --> 01:31:20.108
All right, here we go.

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:29.985

Yes!

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.110
Oh!

01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:56.612
Hey, Coach.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:03.251

One more point and they clinch

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:25.407
Ooh!

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.575
Aah!

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:49.531
[Whistle Blows]

01:32:49.598 --> 01:32:50.999
Point!

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:54.870
Ooh, I'm sorry.

the national championship
title goes to Angel Grove!

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.890
I knew they could do it!

01:33:14.957 --> 01:33:15.991
Come on!

01:33:18.226 --> 01:33:19.928
Yeah.

01:33:19.995 --> 01:33:22.364
Whoo!

01:33:29.805 --> 01:33:31.239
Way to go, guys!

Yeah!

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:39.581
Well, looks like the shelter's
not closing any time soon.

01:33:39.648 --> 01:33:42.117
Come on, Justin.

01:33:44.419 --> 01:33:45.954
Yes! All right!

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:50.592
* Faster, faster *

01:33:50.659 --> 01:33:53.195
* Turbo tigers
in the night *

01:33:56.264 --> 01:33:59.902
* Like turbo tigers
in the darkest night *

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:04.840
* Turbo times *

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:26.294
* So I'm shiftin'
into turbo gear *

01:34:26.361 --> 01:34:30.332
* There's nothing
that can stop me *

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.968
* For I have no fear *

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:35.570
* The pedal's to the metal *

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:39.274
* And I know
I'll disappear *

01:34:39.341 --> 01:34:44.780
* As soon as I shift
into turbo gear *

01:34:49.752 --> 01:34:52.988
* And I'm runnin' low
on gas *

01:34:53.055 --> 01:34:55.824
* I need energy
to concentrate *

01:34:55.891 --> 01:34:59.261
* So I do not crash *

01:34:59.327 --> 01:35:02.297
* Life's a dark
and winding turn *

01:35:02.364 --> 01:35:05.267
* At the end
my goals must be *

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:08.971
* All I need is
a turbo charge of life *

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:11.206
* So I can see *

01:35:11.273 --> 01:35:17.612
* So I'm shiftin' it
into turbo gear *

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:20.916
* There's nothing
that can stop me *

01:35:20.983 --> 01:35:23.886
* For I have no fear *

01:35:23.952 --> 01:35:26.588
* The pedal's to the metal *

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:29.958
* And I know
I'll persevere *

01:35:30.025 --> 01:35:35.798
* As soon as I shift
into turbo gear *

01:35:49.611 --> 01:35:51.546
* I'm shiftin' *

01:35:51.613 --> 01:35:54.716
* Into turbo gear *

01:35:54.783 --> 01:35:57.419
* There's nothin'
that can stop me *

01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:00.188
* For I have no fear *

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:03.091
* The pedal's to the metal *

01:36:03.158 --> 01:36:07.029
* And I know I'll persevere *

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:13.168
* As soon as I shift
into turbo gear *

01:36:13.235 --> 01:36:19.407
* I'm shiftin'
into turbo gear *

01:36:19.474 --> 01:36:22.610
* There's nothin'
that can stop me *

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:25.613
* It's giving me ideas *

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.183
* The pedal's to the metal *

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:31.854
* And a little help
from my peers *

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:34.923
* Together we'll shift
into turbo *

01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:38.226
* Together we'll shift
into turbo *

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:43.298
* Together we'll shift
into turbo gear *

01:36:45.367 --> 01:36:47.135
Shift into turbo.

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:02.217
* Go *

01:37:02.284 --> 01:37:03.185
* Go *

01:37:03.251 --> 01:37:05.653
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.190
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:12.327
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:21.669
* Oh *

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:24.606
* Mighty engines roar *

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.075
* Turbo-charged for more *

01:37:27.142 --> 01:37:29.544
* Drive 4 on the floor *

01:37:29.611 --> 01:37:30.778
* Go *

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.948
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:37:33.015 --> 01:37:35.617
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.552
* Power Rangers turbo *

01:37:47.262 --> 01:37:49.797
* Shift into turbo *

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.500
* Target is on lock *

01:37:52.567 --> 01:37:54.970
* Evil, take a walk *

01:37:55.037 --> 01:37:57.539
* Rangers set to rock *

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:58.706
* Go *

01:37:58.773 --> 01:38:01.076
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:38:01.143 --> 01:38:03.811
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:38:03.878 --> 01:38:07.149
* Power Rangers turbo, go *

01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:12.520
* We're here
to save the world *

01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:15.890
* We're here
to save the world tonight *

01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:17.825
* Save the world *

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:20.295
* We're the good guys *

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:22.597
* We're here
to save the world *

01:38:22.664 --> 01:38:25.767
* We're here
to save the world tonight *

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.702
* Save the world *

01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:30.872
* But now it's time *

01:38:30.939 --> 01:38:32.140
* To unite *

01:38:43.185 --> 01:38:46.621
* Did you think
they even had a chance? *

01:38:48.190 --> 01:38:52.327
* Did you really think
that we would fall apart? *

01:38:52.394 --> 01:38:53.595
* You think
you have a brain *

01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:55.630
* But your heads
are full of nothin' *

01:38:57.832 --> 01:38:58.833
* You better run,
run now *

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.670
* Or it'll be
the end of you *

01:39:02.737 --> 01:39:05.840
* Nobody gets 2 *

01:39:05.907 --> 01:39:07.509
* We're here
to save the world *

01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:10.812
* We're here
to save the world tonight *

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:14.983
* Save the world
from your kind *

01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:17.952
* We're here
to save the world *

01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:21.023
* We're here
to save the world tonight *

01:39:21.089 --> 01:39:23.025
* Save the world *

01:39:23.091 --> 01:39:25.860
* But now it's time *

01:39:25.927 --> 01:39:28.030
* To unite *
