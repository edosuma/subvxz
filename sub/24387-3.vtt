<i>My name is Max William Easton. I'm
a British intelligence officer.</i>

00:02.445 --> 00:04.793
What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

00:04.848 --> 00:06.680
- You believe that?
- You're alive, aren't you?

00:06.751 --> 00:08.076
What are they covering up, Said?

00:08.116 --> 00:09.581
<i>Speak to Ardavan. He knows.</i>

00:09.659 --> 00:12.085
- Knows what?
- What they're really doing out here.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.437
- What <i>you're</i> really doing.
- Where's Ardavan now?

00:14.491 --> 00:17.145
I don't know. I got him a passport.

00:17.215 --> 00:18.905
The name? On the passport?

00:19.499 --> 00:21.382
Darius, Darius Kazim.

00:21.628 --> 00:22.949
Where's he gone, Omar?!

00:24.766 --> 00:25.772
We need to move!

00:30.787 --> 00:32.904
- The Section ordered Harry dead?
- White.

00:32.998 --> 00:34.353
Said couldn't carry it out.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.932
If we find Ardavan, we find Harry.

00:52.762 --> 00:53.981
It's White.

00:55.019 --> 00:56.303
If he realizes Harry's still alive,

00:56.343 --> 00:57.812
what does that mean for you?

00:59.730 --> 01:00.825
<i>Have you closed the book on her?</i>

01:00.865 --> 01:02.481
I'm looking at her right now, George.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.748
<i>Is she breathing?</i>

01:04.881 --> 01:06.018
For now.

01:06.250 --> 01:07.988
She's gonna help me find Said.

01:08.223 --> 01:09.330
Is that wise?

01:09.410 --> 01:10.789
<i>She's the only lead I've got.</i>

01:11.320 --> 01:12.792
Give her 24 hours.

01:12.987 --> 01:14.228
If she doesn't prove herself useful,

01:14.290 --> 01:16.253
I suggest you run out of patience with her.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.547
I'll do that.

01:21.783 --> 01:23.370
You step out of line,

01:23.869 --> 01:27.267
put one hair out of
place, you understand me?

01:31.965 --> 01:33.512
Let's find this Ardavan.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.657
And then we can find Harry.

Said?

06:05.151 --> 06:06.309
Bravo.

06:26.409 --> 06:27.830
We're meeting upstairs.

06:28.869 --> 06:30.122
I saw him.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.077
Who?

06:31.669 --> 06:33.950
- Harry.
- Well, that's impossible.

06:34.020 --> 06:34.958
You can't have.

06:35.044 --> 06:36.053
You must've imagined it.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.502
You lied to me.

06:41.424 --> 06:41.962
Leyla...

06:42.002 --> 06:43.724
Cooper will be upstairs,

06:44.383 --> 06:47.649
unless you want to have this
conversation with both of us?

06:54.530 --> 06:57.117
I took Burnett Hanson
to them, they denied it.

06:57.258 --> 06:59.596
They told me Harry was the breach.

06:59.658 --> 07:01.299
He told me to take care of it.

07:01.358 --> 07:03.327
- Jesus.
- I drove up into the hills.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.752
I couldn't go through with it.

07:07.323 --> 07:08.667
He was supposed to disappear.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.229
And what did you think would happen?

07:10.307 --> 07:13.227
Hmm? You'd come back here
and carry on as normal?

07:14.461 --> 07:16.874
I don't know, I was playing for time.

07:24.317 --> 07:25.859
What are you going to do?

07:35.648 --> 07:37.218
Don't tell White.

07:38.687 --> 07:39.777
Please.

07:41.058 --> 07:42.589
I'm begging you.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.253
You should go.

08:21.648 --> 08:23.685
I don't like being messed with.

08:24.521 --> 08:26.367
You know, Harry's alive.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.230
- I know.
- And where the fuck is Said?

08:30.311 --> 08:32.364
He's supposed to be here. He lied to us.

08:32.965 --> 08:34.366
Maybe he's not coming back.

08:36.496 --> 08:37.698
Have you seen him?

08:40.400 --> 08:40.974
Nope.

08:41.014 --> 08:42.437
We got to call this in.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.390
Think about it for a minute.

08:47.379 --> 08:51.517
We call London, tell them
Said's bottled it, Harry's alive,

08:51.587 --> 08:52.985
both AWOL,

08:53.501 --> 08:55.335
how do you think they're gonna react?

08:55.409 --> 08:57.648
All right. So what now?

09:01.699 --> 09:02.980
We contact White,

09:03.041 --> 09:05.382
tell him everything's on
track, we're after Ardavan.

09:05.439 --> 09:07.719
Because lying to him is a smart move.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.991
Harry came back for answers.
If he didn't get them from Omar,

09:10.069 --> 09:12.205
where will he go next?

09:12.848 --> 09:14.007
Ardavan.

09:14.408 --> 09:15.374
This is bullshit.

09:15.414 --> 09:17.016
This is about you and Harry, isn't it?

09:21.191 --> 09:23.511
Okay, pick up the phone,
go on, call London.

09:23.576 --> 09:25.392
Tell them how fucked it is here.

09:27.444 --> 09:31.842
They gave an order on
Harry to cover their tracks.

09:32.085 --> 09:33.648
Do you really think they're gonna hesitate

09:33.688 --> 09:35.790
to do the same for us?

09:41.019 --> 09:43.338
We figure out what's going on,

09:44.455 --> 09:47.030
take London a solution,

09:47.609 --> 09:48.932
not a problem.

10:02.614 --> 10:03.563
What?

10:05.316 --> 10:08.168
Someone logged into my
account 20 minutes ago.

10:10.822 --> 10:12.800
Wait, does Harry know your passcode?

10:15.464 --> 10:16.402
Yeah.

10:17.172 --> 10:20.061
Ardavan's traveling under
the name Darius Kazim.

10:21.014 --> 10:23.070
Harry's following him to Beirut.

11:58.399 --> 12:01.306
Sir. Sir.

12:01.909 --> 12:02.647
Hey.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.928
I've got something.

12:13.865 --> 12:16.168
<i>Park, uh, Lemaître.</i>

12:18.417 --> 12:20.246
There is no Lemaître
Park in Saint-Michel.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.427
Pull up their files.

12:23.373 --> 12:25.287
Search for "Lemaître."

12:29.682 --> 12:32.021
After their parents died,
they went into a foster home.

12:32.073 --> 12:34.005
Their foster mum was...

12:34.075 --> 12:36.207
Julianne Lemaître. That's it. That's her.

12:36.767 --> 12:37.815
Park?

12:42.509 --> 12:45.579
There's a children's play area
a hundred meters from her house.

12:47.485 --> 12:48.899
Call Laurence.

12:57.437 --> 12:59.087
Noah.

13:09.649 --> 13:10.644
Anna?

13:54.678 --> 13:56.260
Laurence, update, please.

13:57.943 --> 13:59.545
About two minutes away.

14:10.043 --> 14:11.270
<i>Do you see them?</i>

14:12.512 --> 14:13.550
<i>Not yet.</i>

14:21.640 --> 14:22.539
Uh...

15:28.649 --> 15:29.982
They were here.

15:30.084 --> 15:32.287
<i>Then get out there and find them.</i>

17:14.641 --> 17:15.425
Well, this is a nice...

17:15.472 --> 17:17.571
They still keep you in this shithole?

17:18.025 --> 17:20.426
Empire not what it used to be, eh, George?

17:36.253 --> 17:37.484
You didn't need to come.

17:37.570 --> 17:38.660
Yes, I did.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.831
I needed to look you
in the eye and make sure

17:40.918 --> 17:43.035
you weren't going to fuck
this up for all of us.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.496
Perhaps I should not have involved you.

17:45.551 --> 17:46.619
Involve me?

17:47.853 --> 17:49.378
Your asset made a tape

17:49.449 --> 17:50.505
naming you as architect

17:50.545 --> 17:52.118
of highly classified black ops

17:52.189 --> 17:53.924
of grave diplomatic sensitivity.

17:53.987 --> 17:56.067
- I am involved.
- I had it under control.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.846
Right. His civilian wife
and her low-life brother

17:57.886 --> 17:59.619
are rolling around the French countryside

17:59.689 --> 18:02.056
like a pair of loose cannons.

18:02.111 --> 18:04.302
That is something, but it
sure as shit isn't control.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.355
- This is my operation.
- You want a pissing contest?

18:06.395 --> 18:07.877
You're gonna lose, George.

18:07.932 --> 18:09.246
You're lucky we include you at all.

18:09.301 --> 18:11.859
No! You mean we're lucky you use us

18:11.899 --> 18:14.704
to keep your dirty wars at
arm's length from Washington.

18:17.584 --> 18:19.967
Anna and her brother are a threat to us

18:20.029 --> 18:21.341
and everything we have built.

18:21.420 --> 18:24.996
So how about we just put this
little family squabble on hold

18:25.104 --> 18:26.585
and find them?

18:42.399 --> 18:43.154
Hello?

18:43.740 --> 18:45.609
Hassan Nassor?

18:46.598 --> 18:48.831
- I don't know you.
- You come recommended.

18:48.917 --> 18:52.495
Farhad Gul. He procured
us some hardware in Tehran.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.713
Hamid's brother?

18:53.753 --> 18:55.479
Farhad doesn't have a brother.

18:56.580 --> 18:59.555
Okay, so now that we
passed your little test,

18:59.649 --> 19:01.777
you want to take our money or don't you?

19:03.870 --> 19:05.147
Take a seat.

19:06.428 --> 19:07.900
I've been listening to the news.

19:07.970 --> 19:10.051
Trouble in Tehran. Death on the streets.

19:10.129 --> 19:11.954
Yeah, what's that song say?

19:12.328 --> 19:14.202
There's a man going round, taking names.

19:14.249 --> 19:16.933
Well, I guess the man came around.

19:19.167 --> 19:22.097
So, why should I trust you, Johnny Cash?

19:22.755 --> 19:24.117
Jesus Christ.

19:32.294 --> 19:33.968
Ali Ardavan.

19:34.070 --> 19:36.495
In Beirut, keeping below the radar.

19:37.128 --> 19:38.920
We need you to locate him.

19:41.809 --> 19:43.516
Give me a couple of hours.

20:25.864 --> 20:26.815
Oh...

20:42.504 --> 20:44.815
You thought I'd cut and run, didn't you?

20:59.784 --> 21:00.976
Where's Ardavan?

21:01.265 --> 21:03.947
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

21:04.025 --> 21:06.601
Last time we met, you said you
didn't know, turned out you did.

21:06.784 --> 21:08.844
Why don't we skip the whole torture thing?

21:09.823 --> 21:11.695
You just cooperate. What do you say?

21:13.312 --> 21:14.820
What have you found out?

21:16.837 --> 21:19.881
Oh, he's meeting a man
at The Babylonian hotel.

21:20.354 --> 21:22.885
- Anthony Kahani.
- Kahani, who's he?

21:23.794 --> 21:26.628
Iranian-American lobbyist.

21:29.575 --> 21:30.973
Do I get to keep the money?

21:31.753 --> 21:33.411
You get to keep your fingernails.

21:49.662 --> 21:51.846
Kahani's billed to speak.

21:58.494 --> 22:00.827
- Salaam.
- Excuse me, do you have a, a Mr. Kahani

22:00.897 --> 22:02.590
staying at the hotel?

22:02.825 --> 22:05.121
Uh, let me just see.

22:09.103 --> 22:12.099
We do have a Mr. Kahani
staying with us, sir.

22:12.245 --> 22:13.469
Would you like to call him?

22:13.551 --> 22:15.937
- No, that's fine, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

22:16.675 --> 22:18.058
He's in room 819.

22:18.135 --> 22:19.465
He's at the bar.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.110
I'll go.

22:23.479 --> 22:27.527
When was the last time
you rigged a room? I'll go.

22:46.403 --> 22:47.474
<i>Merci.</i>

23:59.785 --> 24:00.879
That's good.

24:03.584 --> 24:04.780
Well done.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.714
- I'll take the first shift.
- Sure.

24:06.832 --> 24:07.627
Yeah.

25:16.525 --> 25:17.580
You okay?

25:21.960 --> 25:23.139
Why are you here?

25:30.320 --> 25:31.565
I'm here to find Harry.

25:31.666 --> 25:34.169
You thought he was dead.

25:35.901 --> 25:37.437
What are you doing back here?

25:38.702 --> 25:40.070
You were out.

25:43.372 --> 25:45.019
They have something on you.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.869
What?

25:51.817 --> 25:53.151
I remarried.

25:55.005 --> 25:59.344
I have... two little girls.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.791
It was made very clear to me that, uh...

26:07.045 --> 26:09.063
if I don't complete this job...

26:10.029 --> 26:11.859
If you don't kill me,

26:13.085 --> 26:15.340
White takes out your family.

26:19.979 --> 26:23.124
Given that choice, I'm
coming in a distant second.

28:37.126 --> 28:38.201
Noah?

28:39.139 --> 28:40.213
Noah!

28:52.661 --> 28:53.956
<i>Sir, you have 15 minutes</i>

28:54.019 --> 28:56.019
<i>before you have to get
to the conference room.</i>

29:05.837 --> 29:06.596
Hey.

29:07.164 --> 29:08.679
- Hey, hey.
- Huh?

29:09.171 --> 29:09.967
Wake up.

29:10.612 --> 29:12.202
Come on, he's on the move.

29:12.873 --> 29:14.848
<i>It's a pleasure to
welcome to the stage</i>

29:14.910 --> 29:17.623
<i>Anthony Kahani, who heads
the Washington think tank</i>

29:17.686 --> 29:20.443
The Committee for Middle Eastern Relations.

29:30.122 --> 29:34.640
Mr. Kahani, you have been
quoted as hailing in a new age

29:34.680 --> 29:36.798
of alliance between the
West and the Middle East...

29:36.838 --> 29:38.353
Do you think Ardavan will show?

29:39.199 --> 29:40.371
Thank you very much.

29:40.473 --> 29:41.555
I hope so.

29:41.806 --> 29:44.008
My critics very conveniently forget

29:44.063 --> 29:45.635
that I was born in Tehran.

29:45.807 --> 29:47.968
But you've also criticized
your birth country.

29:48.039 --> 29:50.540
Only the remaining barriers to peace,

29:50.705 --> 29:52.548
the destabilization of the region

29:52.626 --> 29:53.909
through the use of non-state actors...

29:53.992 --> 29:56.671
If Ardavan is funding
Iran's weapons program,

29:56.749 --> 29:58.367
then why is he coming here to meet him?

29:58.422 --> 29:59.941
- Why's it matter?
- Listen to the guy.

30:00.011 --> 30:03.153
I mean, Kahani's American as apple pie,

30:03.298 --> 30:05.647
evangelical about U.S. democracy,

30:05.694 --> 30:07.956
political lobbyist, lives in D.C.

30:08.354 --> 30:11.215
Maybe he's connected to
Burnett Hanson law firm.

30:12.207 --> 30:15.365
That's not my problem. I'm
just here to find Harry.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.401
Oh, yeah? And what happens when you do?

30:17.441 --> 30:18.940
And the fact of the matter is,

30:19.058 --> 30:20.536
a world with less nuclear weapons...

30:20.591 --> 30:23.362
They've burned five operatives over this.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.780
You think they're gonna spare you?

30:26.882 --> 30:28.102
You need to know what's going on,

30:28.180 --> 30:30.134
just as much as Harry does.

30:31.508 --> 30:34.354
I have more than just hope.
I know it can be mended.

30:55.853 --> 30:56.890
Anna's phone was found

30:56.958 --> 30:59.460
right across from where
the car was reported stolen.

30:59.554 --> 31:00.456
They're avoiding tolls.

31:00.527 --> 31:01.996
If they take the back country
roads, they could be...

31:02.036 --> 31:03.569
They have to be somewhere.

31:04.399 --> 31:07.648
Anna's brother had a
historic charge of car theft

31:07.726 --> 31:09.312
from his days in foster care.

31:09.352 --> 31:10.371
It wasn't on his file.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.913
Get me his juvenile arrest sheet.

31:51.445 --> 31:53.204
<i>Merde.</i>

32:21.539 --> 32:23.116
Fuck you, Noah.

32:34.412 --> 32:35.348
Noah.

32:37.434 --> 32:39.298
Noah's juvenile record.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.747
Five charges: narcotics, amphetamine,

32:42.787 --> 32:44.716
MDMA, cannabis...

32:44.769 --> 32:47.573
And a public disturbance
order, arrested in Gajan.

32:47.651 --> 32:49.553
Where the car was last seen.

32:49.593 --> 32:53.356
<i>La Chesnaie,</i> looks
like arable farmland.

32:53.615 --> 32:55.925
There was one other
charge on the crime report

32:55.965 --> 32:59.149
that the farmer's son, Matthieu Girard.

32:59.189 --> 33:00.892
Anna and Noah's father owned a stake

33:00.966 --> 33:03.828
in a shoot meeting held on
land owned by the Girards.

33:03.907 --> 33:05.835
- A shoot?
- Partridge, grouse.

33:05.875 --> 33:10.459
There are five lodges
scattered around their land.

33:10.521 --> 33:11.727
Get a team up.

33:11.811 --> 33:13.621
Look into it. All five lodges. Go!

34:26.190 --> 34:27.650
<i>So what you're saying, Mr. Kahani,</i>

34:27.690 --> 34:28.908
<i>is that you have hope</i>

34:28.947 --> 34:30.904
<i>that this troubled relationship</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:33.024
<i>between the U.S. and
Iran can be mended?</i>

34:33.085 --> 34:34.246
<i>I have more than just hope.</i>

34:34.318 --> 34:37.579
I know it can be mended, and I'm
glad you asked me that question.

34:37.981 --> 34:40.972
Because the new developments and
business opportunities with Iran

34:41.034 --> 34:42.322
ushers in a new era

34:42.400 --> 34:44.567
of communication between our nations.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.241
One that, uh...

34:49.400 --> 34:51.041
Uh, one that, uh,

34:51.081 --> 34:53.630
e-extends from the political arena

34:53.702 --> 34:55.764
to that of our corporate boardrooms.

34:55.835 --> 34:57.183
Ardavan's here.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.303
After this very interesting conversation

35:00.381 --> 35:01.704
we are taking a break.

35:01.907 --> 35:03.822
It's a great pleasure
having you here today.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.222
Thank you very much.

35:14.377 --> 35:15.430
Just wait.

35:17.272 --> 35:18.740
What are you doing here?

35:51.427 --> 35:52.464
No.

36:13.864 --> 36:15.059
<i>Morning Herald.</i>

36:15.099 --> 36:17.449
Hi. May I speak to Olivia Clarke?

36:17.527 --> 36:19.219
<i>Uh, she's not at work right now.</i>

36:19.600 --> 36:21.586
Do you have a mobile number for her?

36:21.648 --> 36:23.800
<i>Sorry, I can't give that out.</i>

36:24.054 --> 36:25.481
Do you know when she will be back?

36:25.535 --> 36:26.803
<i>No, I don't.</i>

36:33.699 --> 36:35.662
Mm-hmm.

36:45.071 --> 36:47.624
Please, I-I really need to speak to her

36:47.702 --> 36:49.897
- about a personal, urgent matter. <i>
- Maman.</i>

36:49.937 --> 36:51.439
- Mummy. <i>
- Maman.</i>

36:53.202 --> 36:56.097
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm juggling a lot here.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.558
Please.

36:59.542 --> 37:01.173
<i>She's on compassionate leave.</i>

37:01.302 --> 37:03.260
<i>Her son, he passed away.</i>

37:05.386 --> 37:08.382
Yes. I-I know, um...

37:08.590 --> 37:10.152
We're trying to understand how.

37:10.196 --> 37:12.923
<i>It, it was a road
accident a few days ago.</i>

37:13.640 --> 37:15.743
<i>Somewhere in the
Middle East, I think.</i>

37:16.626 --> 37:17.686
<i>Maman!</i>

37:17.797 --> 37:18.706
Thank you.

38:00.894 --> 38:02.055
The brother's still out there.

38:02.095 --> 38:03.576
Yeah, well, that's the easy part.

38:04.459 --> 38:06.660
Now we have the wife,
we use her to get to him.

38:07.805 --> 38:09.813
You <i>can</i> handle
that, can't you, George?

38:12.408 --> 38:13.702
What about Walker?

38:15.764 --> 38:17.852
Yeah, he could be a problem for us.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.384
We have to handle him carefully.

38:20.424 --> 38:21.875
His is a power play, pure and simple.

38:21.915 --> 38:23.499
Do not begrudge a man his ambition, George.

38:23.539 --> 38:25.664
Just bring it in line with yours.

38:26.703 --> 38:29.560
It's better to have him
inside the tent, pissing out.

38:32.638 --> 38:33.561
Yeah.

38:36.373 --> 38:37.541
Walker.

38:37.937 --> 38:38.748
Thank you for coming.

38:38.793 --> 38:40.077
Please take a seat.

38:51.411 --> 38:52.962
Why are we here, Walker?

38:53.431 --> 38:55.163
That's a bit existential, isn't it?

38:57.045 --> 38:58.530
What is it that we do?

38:59.324 --> 39:00.389
We're a bilateral organ

39:00.444 --> 39:01.774
of the Anglo-American intelligence...

39:01.844 --> 39:03.135
Why did you sign up?

39:04.688 --> 39:05.805
To serve my country.

39:05.845 --> 39:07.849
We're all fully aware of who you serve.

39:12.554 --> 39:14.498
I don't appreciate being
shut out, that's all.

39:14.538 --> 39:17.175
First fact of intelligence:
you can never know everything.

39:19.549 --> 39:21.054
We understand you were
thinking of your career.

39:21.094 --> 39:21.783
No.

39:21.828 --> 39:23.303
I wasn't thinking of my career.

39:23.358 --> 39:25.116
Serving your country, yes, you said.

39:26.686 --> 39:29.073
Situations arise that
require the swift wrath

39:29.167 --> 39:30.178
of people like us.

39:30.218 --> 39:32.291
The millions we serve depend upon it.

39:32.564 --> 39:34.966
We fail in our wrath, we fail them.

39:35.298 --> 39:36.367
I understand that.

39:36.407 --> 39:37.251
Good.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.723
After some soul-searching, George here

39:41.801 --> 39:44.734
has magnanimously decided
to give you a second chance.

39:44.929 --> 39:46.513
Do not screw that up.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.867
Or to put it another way:
play either one of us again,

39:49.933 --> 39:52.205
I will burn you where you sit.

40:13.718 --> 40:15.772
Through here.

40:15.850 --> 40:18.690
<i>I helped Washington put this
whole damn operation together.</i>

40:18.730 --> 40:20.377
<i>You guys would be
nowhere without me.</i>

40:20.440 --> 40:22.215
I financed half of the deal.

40:22.536 --> 40:23.785
And now I'm the one being hunted?

40:23.825 --> 40:25.719
- I think you should calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

40:25.759 --> 40:27.618
I'll calm down when I fucking well want to!

40:27.658 --> 40:29.086
Langley didn't put you on any list.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.094
No, Tehran did, but you
did nothing to stop them.

40:31.134 --> 40:32.941
We didn't know about it!

40:38.387 --> 40:39.754
We had no idea.

40:41.512 --> 40:43.419
You're selling me out on this one.

40:43.799 --> 40:46.041
No one has any intention
of selling you out.

40:46.081 --> 40:47.160
You are selling me out.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.382
- No.
- Let me show you something

40:49.422 --> 40:51.041
to help focus your mind.

40:57.992 --> 40:59.295
<i>Know what those are?</i>

41:00.892 --> 41:02.320
<i>These mean nothing.</i>

41:03.170 --> 41:04.207
<i>Not in isolation.</i>

41:04.270 --> 41:06.384
I can prove exactly what they mean.

41:13.232 --> 41:14.307
What do you want?

41:15.814 --> 41:16.951
I want asylum.

41:16.991 --> 41:18.788
My feet on American soil.

41:18.828 --> 41:20.729
Full citizenship.

41:24.566 --> 41:25.597
Okay.

41:26.972 --> 41:27.901
Okay.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.384
Wait here.

41:32.204 --> 41:33.684
Put that back in your pocket.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.153
Better still, bury it

41:35.497 --> 41:37.061
before it buries you.

41:44.147 --> 41:44.896
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:44.936 --> 41:46.097
<i>We have a problem.</i>

41:46.656 --> 41:47.546
<i>Ardavan's here.</i>

41:47.632 --> 41:49.197
Just showed up unannounced.

41:52.219 --> 41:53.343
Asylum.

41:57.562 --> 41:59.366
I think we should give it to him.

42:07.822 --> 42:08.972
Okay.

42:09.050 --> 42:11.403
They're sending a car to
pick you up, two streets away.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.360
You will be on the next flight to JFK.

42:13.414 --> 42:15.327
- <i>Good.</i>
- <i>Good?</i>

42:16.278 --> 42:17.451
<i>You coming with me?</i>

42:17.560 --> 42:18.829
Of course.

42:19.628 --> 42:20.629
You lead.

42:22.236 --> 42:24.878
If we lose Ardavan, we lose
our chance of finding Harry.

42:32.856 --> 42:33.544
Khalid...

42:51.997 --> 42:53.755
They've changed the pickup point.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.080
Let's cut through here.

44:20.780 --> 44:21.720
Is he down?

44:22.389 --> 44:23.655
There's someone else.

44:24.331 --> 44:25.356
Cover me.

44:49.540 --> 44:50.739
Drop the gun.

44:59.437 --> 45:00.800
Turn around.

45:01.244 --> 45:02.480
Slowly.

Where are the girls?

The girls?

45:22.767 --> 45:24.558
White's targeting my kids.

45:24.597 --> 45:25.665
He wants you dead.

45:25.731 --> 45:27.074
