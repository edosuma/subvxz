00:29.863 --> 00:32.824
- Told you. Piece of cake.
- Let's just do this and get out of here.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.244
Relax, Clay. I told you
no one's home. The owner's dead.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.915
Stay here. Keep watch.
We'll get the urn.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.713
- Clay doesn't know, does he?
- Why spook him?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.132
He'd believe it was the curse
that killed the old man.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.384
He was stung to death
by a scorpion, Wesley,

00:51.551 --> 00:53.011
in the bathroom of an aeroplane.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.849
- Don't tell me you believe in that crap.
- You think I'd be here if I did?

00:59.350 --> 01:01.311
Is that it?

01:01.519 --> 01:03.438
That's it.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.445
- You see any scorpions around?
- No, just dollar signs.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.489
- Let's go.
- Hey, there's a car coming.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.742
- You guys must've tripped an alarm.
- Let's get out of here.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.920
I should've never let you guys
talk me into this.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.298
Shut up. We'll split up
and meet in San Francisco.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.383
Take this to your friend
and hock it right away.

01:32.550 --> 01:36.345
And don't you think about ripping
us off, because I'll find you.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.189
What? What...?

01:47.356 --> 01:49.775
What are you?

01:49.942 --> 01:53.446
- I'm The Guardian of the urn.
- The what?

01:55.781 --> 01:58.200
Hey, what are you doing?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.500
You're being punished
for your greed.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.173
As for your friends...

02:21.891 --> 02:24.685
- New York Clay? That Clay?
- That's the one.

02:24.852 --> 02:26.604
You said you never wanted
to see him again.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.314
- Ancient history.
- Six months?

02:28.480 --> 02:31.734
Five. He's just stopping by
on his way home. It's not a big deal.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.152
He was travelling or something.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.570
- Who's Clay?
- Nobody.

02:34.778 --> 02:36.238
Her ex-boyfriend. The musician.

02:36.405 --> 02:39.283
She met him when she was working
at the Rainbow Room. You remember.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.244
No, I don't. Nobody told me.
They hired you at the Rainbow Room?

02:42.411 --> 02:45.414
Yeah, she was a hostess until she
started working at the Chelsea Pier.

02:45.581 --> 02:48.667
Okay, can we talk about this
later please?

02:49.168 --> 02:50.502
A lot later.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.880
We're just friends.
That's all, you know.

02:53.046 --> 02:55.549
- Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
- Yes.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.427
That was mean.

02:58.594 --> 02:59.928
- That was not mean.
- Okay.

03:03.974 --> 03:05.684
Phoebe.

03:05.893 --> 03:07.102
Clay.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.814
It's really good to see you.

03:23.327 --> 03:25.037
You okay?

05:17.356 --> 05:19.942
What else don't I know?

05:20.484 --> 05:23.946
Prue, don't take this personally,
but sometimes you can be judgmental.

05:24.113 --> 05:25.990
Oh, that is so not true.

05:29.201 --> 05:32.204
All right, so maybe
it's sometimes true.

05:32.830 --> 05:36.333
I just don't understand why Phoebe
never even told me about this guy.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.003
People don't like to dwell
on things that end badly.

05:39.169 --> 05:41.922
Yeah, well, I wish my relationships
ended that badly.

05:42.089 --> 05:44.550
Did you hear them last night?
There was music,

05:44.717 --> 05:47.553
- there was wine, there was...
- Talking.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.972
And how do you know
there was wine?

05:50.139 --> 05:51.432
Okay, so I peeked.

05:52.224 --> 05:57.020
Well, you know, if nobody tells me
anything, I have to get creative.

05:57.521 --> 06:00.232
Stop worrying. She'll be fine.

06:01.942 --> 06:03.444
She knows what she's doing.

06:03.652 --> 06:06.613
Watch that entrance,
make sure nobody comes in.

06:23.213 --> 06:26.925
- Whoa, Doug. Easy.
- Thanks, Piper.

06:27.926 --> 06:29.302
I hope Shelly didn't see that.

06:29.511 --> 06:32.222
Don't worry about it, Doug.
You just hang in there.

06:34.808 --> 06:37.310
- What was that?
- What?

06:37.519 --> 06:40.480
That. You know, the guy, the glass.

06:40.647 --> 06:42.107
Do you do that often?

06:42.274 --> 06:44.901
Freeze time in front of,
I don't know, let's say, everybody?

06:45.110 --> 06:48.363
Yeah. I'm finally getting
some control over the unfreezing.

06:48.530 --> 06:51.491
The poor guy, he just keeps
dropping everything.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.869
- Then maybe you should just fire him.
- The owner wants me to.

06:55.036 --> 06:57.581
Actually, he threatened
to fire me if I don't.

06:57.789 --> 07:00.792
But he's going through a hard time.
Shelly, the waitress, just dumped him

07:00.959 --> 07:04.379
- after six years of dating.
- So, what? You're playing cupid

07:04.546 --> 07:08.925
- at the risk of your own job?
- Yeah. I mean, Doug loves her.

07:09.134 --> 07:11.261
He even bought an
engagement ring and everything.

07:11.428 --> 07:14.264
He just waited too long to ask.
So now he's a wreck.

07:14.472 --> 07:18.977
Still, you can't just keep, you know,
freezing in order to protect him.

07:19.185 --> 07:20.895
I know.

07:21.729 --> 07:23.940
So are you still going back
to Buckland's?

07:24.107 --> 07:25.984
Yeah, that's where I work.

07:26.192 --> 07:29.404
I just figured after everything
that happened with Rex and Hannah

07:29.571 --> 07:31.364
that you would be hitting
the classifieds.

07:31.573 --> 07:34.784
Well, if we don't save
the auction house, I might have to.

07:34.951 --> 07:36.619
Rex...

07:39.038 --> 07:40.832
Bankrupt.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.667
What were you saying?

07:42.834 --> 07:45.336
Never mind. Gotta go.

07:56.389 --> 07:59.725
I wish you could've been there,
Phoebe. You would've loved Egypt.

07:59.934 --> 08:06.691
Pyramids, giant sphinx,
Nile river, camel taxis.

08:06.857 --> 08:09.527
- It was amazing.
- You rode a camel?

08:09.694 --> 08:12.154
They're friendlier than some
of the cab drivers I've met.

08:12.321 --> 08:14.782
Can't imagine they're faster.

08:18.285 --> 08:20.162
You were right to leave me.

08:20.538 --> 08:22.790
Oh, and the conversation turns.

08:22.957 --> 08:26.127
No, I'm serious. You're the best thing
that ever happened to me

08:26.293 --> 08:28.379
and I blew it. I know that.

08:28.546 --> 08:30.214
Clay...

08:30.381 --> 08:33.967
- What? Too much too soon?
- Yup.

08:36.178 --> 08:40.432
Look, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

08:42.559 --> 08:46.021
But why are you here
with me now?

08:46.230 --> 08:49.358
What? Can't a guy visit?

08:49.525 --> 08:51.652
Yeah, but you're not just a guy.

08:51.819 --> 08:55.906
You're Clay, and Clay
comes with strings attached.

08:56.073 --> 08:58.951
I never could
hide anything from you.

08:59.118 --> 09:02.538
Actually, you could. That was one
of our problems, remember?

09:03.580 --> 09:05.916
I picked up this urn at...

09:06.583 --> 09:08.544
...an overseas market.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.295
Thought it might be
worth something.

09:11.213 --> 09:14.967
So you want me
to get Prue to help you

09:15.133 --> 09:17.094
because of the auction house.

09:17.261 --> 09:19.012
Guilty.

09:20.389 --> 09:21.890
For a minute there,

09:22.057 --> 09:25.185
I thought you were here
to win me back.

09:25.352 --> 09:26.687
No, Phoebe.

09:26.853 --> 09:30.732
I think too much for you
to still believe you're interested.

09:30.899 --> 09:32.567
Look,

09:33.193 --> 09:34.778
it's no secret.

09:34.945 --> 09:37.114
I've been in some trouble.

09:37.322 --> 09:38.990
I've gotten in too deep.

09:39.199 --> 09:42.744
I thought if I could sell this urn,
make some money, pay off a debt,

09:42.953 --> 09:44.830
I can make a fresh start.

09:46.665 --> 09:48.834
Hey, think about it.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.462
Please, Phoebe.

09:59.594 --> 10:02.764
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. You must be Prue.

10:03.306 --> 10:06.101
- And you must be...
- Claire.

10:06.267 --> 10:07.560
Claire Pryce.

10:07.727 --> 10:11.439
The bank assigned me to see
if the business is worth salvaging.

10:11.606 --> 10:13.775
I'm looking for inventory records.

10:13.942 --> 10:16.486
The files in my predecessor's
office were empty.

10:17.112 --> 10:20.657
Yes, well, Rex and Hannah
weren't exactly qualified.

10:21.366 --> 10:25.203
Obviously why Buckland's
is in such dire straits.

10:26.830 --> 10:29.999
To be honest with you, Prue,
I don't know anything

10:30.166 --> 10:32.377
about auction houses,
and I know even less about art.

10:32.585 --> 10:34.504
But what I do know
is the bottom line.

10:35.004 --> 10:39.968
If we don't move $1.2 million worth
of inventory at the auction tomorrow,

10:40.176 --> 10:41.636
I'm shutting the place down.

10:41.803 --> 10:44.806
- Excuse me, did you say "tomorrow"?
- Did I stutter?

10:45.890 --> 10:50.019
With all due respect, you don't just
decide to throw an auction, okay?

10:50.186 --> 10:53.898
You need advance notice,
a catalogue, buyers.

10:54.065 --> 10:57.360
Then it looks like you've got a lot
of work ahead of you, doesn't it?

11:02.990 --> 11:04.617
Sorry.

11:05.576 --> 11:07.328
Who was that?

11:07.495 --> 11:09.163
The new sheriff.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.415
- Hey, Prue.
- Hey, Clay. What's up?

11:11.582 --> 11:13.376
A favour.

11:13.542 --> 11:17.338
Clay was hoping that maybe
you could sell this for him.

11:17.505 --> 11:20.466
Yeah, I picked it up
at a market overseas.

11:20.633 --> 11:23.010
Picked it up?
Does that mean you bought it?

11:23.177 --> 11:24.428
What else could it mean?

11:25.137 --> 11:27.598
Well, it's really beautiful.

11:27.765 --> 11:31.602
Gold inlay, 24 carat, a lot of lapis,
looks to be from Egypt.

11:31.769 --> 11:34.146
Exactly.
That's where I was travelling.

11:34.313 --> 11:38.526
- These etchings are very unusual.
- You think it's worth something?

11:38.734 --> 11:43.072
Well, I would have to determine
the urn's origins, its previous owners...

11:43.280 --> 11:46.992
- Couldn't you just skip a step or two?
- Phoebe, I cannot risk

11:47.159 --> 11:50.079
this auction house's reputation on
something like this without checking.

11:50.246 --> 11:53.207
Come on, come on. I will...

11:53.374 --> 11:55.459
What will I do?
I will cook you dinner.

11:55.626 --> 11:57.920
Don't threaten me.
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

11:58.087 --> 11:59.630
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.423
Is she the best or what?

12:01.590 --> 12:02.883
Thank you, thank you.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.843
I love you.

12:15.687 --> 12:16.980
Thanks for doing that, Phoebe.

12:17.147 --> 12:20.108
No problem. Prue will get you
a great price for it too.

12:20.275 --> 12:21.693
She's really good at her job.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.821
Well, it'd be nice if she
just liked me a little bit.

12:24.988 --> 12:28.367
She likes you. She's just real
protective of me, that's all.

12:28.533 --> 12:32.204
- I remember when that was my job.
- Yeah, and then I quit you.

12:32.371 --> 12:33.622
Hey, Clay.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.500
Palmer.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.711
- What are you doing here?
- I'm bumping into you.

12:40.379 --> 12:42.589
- Aren't you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

12:42.756 --> 12:44.966
Phoebe, this is Palmer.
I met him in Cairo.

12:45.175 --> 12:47.677
- Hi. Oh, wow. Small world, huh?
- Yeah.

12:47.886 --> 12:51.640
- Hey, what's going on with that urn?
- You know about the urn too?

12:52.557 --> 12:56.019
Well, actually that's where we met,
at the marketplace where I bought it.

12:56.186 --> 12:59.314
Yeah, right, the marketplace.
I thought you were gonna sell it?

12:59.523 --> 13:01.483
Phoebe's sister works
at that auction house.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.152
- She's looking for a buyer.
- That's good. That's good.

13:04.319 --> 13:07.072
The sooner the better, I guess, huh?

13:08.239 --> 13:11.034
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

13:11.201 --> 13:13.995
It's just I'm a little tired.
Jet lag, you know.

13:14.204 --> 13:16.456
Are you staying at the Ashcroft
like I suggested?

13:16.665 --> 13:17.791
Yeah, sure.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.459
Good. Me too.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.795
Maybe we'll hook up later?

13:22.962 --> 13:25.465
- It was nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. You too.

13:28.968 --> 13:30.929
Creepy guy.

13:32.305 --> 13:34.015
Yeah.

13:35.558 --> 13:37.560
You hungry?

13:53.117 --> 13:55.995
- Help you?
- I was a friend of Wesley's.

13:56.162 --> 13:58.664
His family wanted me to make sure
he got home all right.

13:58.831 --> 14:01.334
Sorry. How did he die?

14:01.501 --> 14:02.794
I don't know.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.213
Spider bite, I think.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.466
He's off to JFK, right?

14:08.633 --> 14:10.718
First flight in the morning.

14:17.391 --> 14:19.560
Sorry, Wes.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.545
What am I supposed to think, Piper?

14:46.754 --> 14:49.465
Phoebe's ex pops into town and wants
me to sell something for him.

14:49.632 --> 14:51.008
You think that's a coincidence?

14:51.217 --> 14:53.594
Oh, Prue, you wonder why
you're out of the loop.

14:53.761 --> 14:55.554
You worry too much about Phoebe.

14:55.763 --> 14:59.433
No, I don't. I just don't wanna
see her get hurt, that's all.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.978
Look, I just get this really
bad feeling about Clay.

15:03.145 --> 15:05.189
<i>- I can't explain it.
- I can.</i>

15:05.397 --> 15:07.066
You don't think
he's good enough for her.

15:07.232 --> 15:10.194
Just like you didn't think Jeremy
was good enough for me.

15:10.361 --> 15:13.197
Of course, in his case, you were right.
But that's not my point.

15:13.405 --> 15:17.785
No, your point is that it's none of my
business, and you're probably right.

15:18.243 --> 15:20.746
Speaking of playing matchmaker,
how's Doug?

15:20.954 --> 15:22.706
The same, unfortunately.

15:22.873 --> 15:25.667
Except I'm getting a little
freeze frazzled. It's draining.

15:25.876 --> 15:28.086
Don't you think you need to find
a better way to deal,

15:28.253 --> 15:29.504
before you get fired?

15:29.713 --> 15:31.215
I know.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.009
I gotta go. I gotta go.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.309
Sorry, Doug. Too pooped to pop.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.231
I'm surprised you moved back here.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.109
I remember a few late nights,
a few beers,

15:51.276 --> 15:54.112
a few not-so-pleasant
conversations about your sisters.

15:54.780 --> 15:58.200
And here you are
living together again.

15:58.408 --> 15:59.743
Necessity or choice?

15:59.951 --> 16:02.496
I think a little bit of both.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
Anyway, things have...

16:04.831 --> 16:07.209
...kind of picked up
at the Halliwell Manor.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.086
- Yeah? Like how?
- Oh, well, let's just say

16:10.253 --> 16:14.299
San Francisco has been a lot more
unusual than New York.

16:14.466 --> 16:17.427
- More rice?
- No, thanks.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.639
You know, Phoebe,

16:20.805 --> 16:24.059
you really haven't said much
about what you've been doing.

16:24.225 --> 16:27.353
- Protecting the innocent from evil.
- Come on, be serious.

16:28.730 --> 16:30.940
I mean, you barely
had a spare minute in New York,

16:31.107 --> 16:33.318
three jobs just to afford
your social calendar.

16:34.277 --> 16:36.488
Things have changed.

16:37.238 --> 16:38.740
I've changed.

16:41.159 --> 16:43.995
I'm trying to change too.

16:46.039 --> 16:50.209
One thing that won't change
is how I feel about you.

16:57.925 --> 16:59.469
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

16:59.635 --> 17:04.723
No, it's not that, believe me. I...

17:06.726 --> 17:10.521
It took me a long time
to get over you. And...

17:11.897 --> 17:13.733
...I just wanna be careful.

17:17.111 --> 17:19.155
I understand.

17:20.489 --> 17:22.366
But if I clean up my act...

17:24.327 --> 17:25.912
...would you consider moving back.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.788
Do not go there now.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.629
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay. It happens.

17:36.464 --> 17:38.799
I should get back
to the hotel anyway.

17:38.966 --> 17:41.927
- Clay, stop. I got it. I got it.
- Okay.

17:42.219 --> 17:45.473
- So how's it going with the urn?
- It's going.

17:45.681 --> 17:48.976
I think what he's trying to ask is,
"Is it going, going, gone?"

17:49.185 --> 17:51.312
Well, I put it on the auction block.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.731
Great. That's great. Thanks a lot.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.609
I'm still waiting for the background
check to come through on it

17:56.775 --> 17:58.110
so I can set a reserve price.

17:58.319 --> 18:00.446
Okay, whatever you get
for it is fine with me.

18:00.863 --> 18:02.907
As long as it sells, right,
and in a hurry?

18:03.115 --> 18:07.161
Well, from what I understand,
if anyone can do that, it's you.

18:08.662 --> 18:11.665
So I will call you tomorrow.

18:11.832 --> 18:13.417
Maybe you can show me
around the city,

18:13.584 --> 18:15.961
help me see where I left my heart.

18:20.507 --> 18:23.051
Hey, I really appreciate it.
Thanks again.

18:23.218 --> 18:25.304
Anything for Pheebs.

18:25.763 --> 18:28.682
- See you later.
- Okay.

18:32.603 --> 18:35.189
- What?
- Nothing.

18:35.689 --> 18:38.692
I can worry about
my little sister, can't I?

18:38.859 --> 18:40.652
Don't ever stop.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.536
Are you okay?

18:49.703 --> 18:51.830
Nothing to see here. Move along.

18:52.372 --> 18:55.250
- Welcome to London.
- What did you do?

18:55.459 --> 18:57.002
More like, who did you do it to?

18:57.461 --> 19:00.881
I put a charm on Doug,
but I doubled the recipes.

19:01.047 --> 19:02.841
Just something to boost
his confidence

19:03.008 --> 19:05.093
so he can give love a shot
and give me a break.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.471
Go ahead, Prue. Yell at her.

19:07.637 --> 19:09.931
It's not for personal gain
and it fits into the whole

19:10.098 --> 19:11.558
harm-none thing
we have top live by.

19:11.725 --> 19:13.476
Besides, Prue told me
to do something.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.729
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.

19:15.896 --> 19:19.316
I just need Doug to stop dropping
things so I can stop freezing things.

19:19.524 --> 19:20.734
I'm just exhausted.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.778
You know, maybe he and Shelly
aren't meant to be together.

19:23.987 --> 19:26.573
Not everybody's supposed to be.

19:26.740 --> 19:29.284
Oh, that was real subtle, Prue.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.913
Well, we'll never know unless Doug
has the guts to pop the question.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.665
All I'm doing is giving it to him.

19:36.332 --> 19:39.377
<i>It's just like The Cowardly Lion
from The Wizard of Oz.</i>

19:41.254 --> 19:42.464
Well, it is.

19:48.803 --> 19:51.556
Ladies and gentlemen,
this exquisite bronze-plated carving

19:51.723 --> 19:53.808
dates back well over 120 years.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.394
Surely, it's worth more
than $2500 dollars.

19:56.561 --> 19:58.605
Do I hear 26? 26?

19:58.771 --> 20:02.608
Mark, move the F. Scott Fitzgerald pen
to the next slot, all right?

20:02.775 --> 20:04.861
Our buyer, Mr Gordenson,
is getting restless. Go.

20:05.028 --> 20:06.529
Twenty-six, going once.

20:06.696 --> 20:09.407
- I think you should see this, Prue.
- What is it?

20:09.574 --> 20:12.034
It's the appraisal on the urn
you requested.

20:13.619 --> 20:15.830
The good news is
it's worth a fortune.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.291
- The bad news is...
- It's stolen.

20:18.499 --> 20:21.711
Apparently. No wonder
the auction house is going under.

20:21.878 --> 20:23.671
Selling stolen goods.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.674
No, this is highly unusual
and very embarrassing.

20:26.883 --> 20:28.384
Yes, it is.

20:28.551 --> 20:31.554
Yes. Now 16? 16,000?

20:31.762 --> 20:33.931
- Oh, no.
- Sixteen thousand?

20:35.600 --> 20:38.602
Fifteen thousand going once,
going twice.

20:39.312 --> 20:41.230
Sold for 15,000.

20:41.397 --> 20:43.357
Paddle number three.

20:43.524 --> 20:47.445
Next item up,
lot number 51, 5-1.

20:48.696 --> 20:53.742
This beautiful 24-carat
gold inlay urn from Egypt...

20:54.869 --> 20:57.204
Obviously,
there's been some mistake.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.007
- Who are you?
- You must be Prue, Phoebe's sister.

21:08.215 --> 21:12.386
- Same question, who are you?
- Me?

21:12.553 --> 21:14.638
I'm a friend of Clay's.

21:14.847 --> 21:17.182
Why didn't you sell that urn?
You're supposed to sell it.

21:17.349 --> 21:19.810
- I think you'd better leave.
- No. Don't you understand?

21:19.977 --> 21:22.521
- You have to sell it before the curse.
- Curse? What curse?

21:22.730 --> 21:24.606
The urn, it's cursed.

21:24.815 --> 21:28.402
Never mind. Forget it.
I'll get rid of it myself.

21:30.279 --> 21:32.823
Oh, my God. It is cursed.

21:33.031 --> 21:34.324
Oh, no.

21:36.702 --> 21:39.454
- What's going on?
- The curse.

21:39.621 --> 21:41.373
It's happening.

21:41.582 --> 21:42.916
It's too late.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.419
I gotta get out of here.

21:54.720 --> 21:58.140
So do you believe in giving people
second chances?

21:58.306 --> 22:01.852
Absolutely. That's probably why
I wanted to help out Doug so much.

22:02.060 --> 22:06.440
Okay, well, Clay says he can change
and I wanna believe him, but...

22:06.606 --> 22:09.484
But you're afraid of getting hurt.
That's totally understandable.

22:09.693 --> 22:12.445
So I keep my distance
and then what?

22:12.612 --> 22:14.114
Hope that I'm wrong?

22:15.448 --> 22:20.370
Well, you could be. That premonition
of yours was definitely the future.

22:20.537 --> 22:23.873
Yeah, but the problem is
I keep thinking about the past.

22:24.583 --> 22:28.795
When I moved to New York,
I was so angry.

22:29.337 --> 22:31.464
All right, I was scared.

22:32.215 --> 22:35.593
And then I met Clay,
and he helped me out a lot.

22:35.760 --> 22:40.432
He was really good to me at a time
in my life when nobody else was.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.518
Sorry, you know what I mean.
I didn't mean it like that.

22:43.685 --> 22:45.895
All right. That's fine.

22:46.688 --> 22:48.523
So why did you leave him?

22:48.690 --> 22:51.192
Well, he kept living
beyond his means.

22:51.359 --> 22:53.069
He never thought of the future.

22:54.112 --> 22:57.073
Yeah, I know that sounds familiar.

22:57.574 --> 22:59.867
Let's just say...

23:00.034 --> 23:02.328
...he took one too many shortcuts.

23:02.495 --> 23:07.125
Got involved with some bad people,
got in over his head, way over his head.

23:07.292 --> 23:11.671
And finally I just couldn't take it
anymore. I had to leave.

23:11.838 --> 23:15.550
And so now he's back, hoping to be
the man you fell in love with originally.

23:15.717 --> 23:18.594
Yeah. So, what do I do?

23:18.761 --> 23:20.179
What if he's the one?

23:20.346 --> 23:22.473
Like you say Doug and Shelly are.

23:22.682 --> 23:25.434
- Do I just walk away?
- No, but...

23:25.643 --> 23:27.061
We can't live together forever.

23:27.228 --> 23:32.608
What do we expect, to be 60 years old
and still be sharing clothes and a cat?

23:32.775 --> 23:35.444
Well, now that
you put it that way, no.

23:35.611 --> 23:37.822
I don't wanna live with you anymore.

23:42.994 --> 23:44.620
Oh, boy.

23:48.791 --> 23:52.086
I thought your charm
was to boost his confidence

23:52.253 --> 23:54.630
not turn him into Tom Cruise.

23:54.839 --> 23:56.924
Maybe I shouldn't have
doubled the recipe.

23:57.758 --> 23:59.218
Yeah.

24:01.345 --> 24:02.888
Doug.

24:03.681 --> 24:05.057
What's going on?

24:06.058 --> 24:10.020
Not sure, but whatever it is,
I feel great.

24:15.025 --> 24:16.944
Thanks, Doug.

24:17.528 --> 24:19.488
Doug, what about Shelly?

24:20.239 --> 24:23.867
Who cares about Shelly when I got
Thursday, Friday and Saturday

24:24.076 --> 24:26.161
all lined up and waiting?

24:27.079 --> 24:31.125
- I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
- I don't believe you will. Off limits.

24:34.336 --> 24:36.004
Well, your charm worked.

24:36.171 --> 24:38.549
- You've turned Doug into...
- A monster.

24:40.342 --> 24:43.428
I gotta go. I told Clay
I'd meet him over at the house.

24:43.637 --> 24:45.222
Goodbye.

25:03.115 --> 25:05.075
Leaving?

25:05.784 --> 25:08.495
- How'd you get here?
- I came with your friend.

25:08.662 --> 25:11.706
I waited for your fear
to consume you.

25:12.582 --> 25:14.626
Where's the urn?

25:15.252 --> 25:17.379
The Buckland Auction House.
I tried to get it back.

25:17.587 --> 25:18.839
I was gonna return it, I swear.

25:19.047 --> 25:23.385
I tired to make things right.
Please! Don't! I'm sorry.

25:24.511 --> 25:25.804
No!

25:26.012 --> 25:28.390
No, no, no!

25:29.057 --> 25:31.268
You're being punished
for your greed.

25:38.525 --> 25:41.444
So the band goes on at 10:00,
but if we get there before 9:00

25:41.611 --> 25:45.532
- there's no cover. You interested?
- In anything that involves you.

25:51.704 --> 25:53.498
Okay.

26:01.589 --> 26:03.508
- Déjà...
- Vu.

26:04.425 --> 26:08.012
I miss this.
The day-to-day of us.

26:11.641 --> 26:13.893
Yeah. Me too.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.564
Okay, well, I'm gonna change now.

26:19.107 --> 26:20.233
Okay.

26:21.943 --> 26:23.820
Oh, you want me to leave.

26:23.986 --> 26:26.572
That's kind of
a loaded question, but yeah,

26:26.781 --> 26:30.201
- I think that would be best.
- Phoebe, we did live together.

26:30.368 --> 26:32.954
- It's not like I haven't...
- Yeah, I know.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.790
But things have changed.

26:36.958 --> 26:39.627
Come here. Sit down.

26:42.338 --> 26:44.257
- Very different.
- Do they have to be?

26:44.715 --> 26:46.092
Well...

26:47.260 --> 26:49.887
You know, when you...

26:50.972 --> 26:53.474
Okay, stop. Stop.

26:56.352 --> 26:59.021
Okay, go. Go.

27:01.065 --> 27:03.359
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

27:03.526 --> 27:08.531
Okay, you know this isn't fair
because I love it when you...

27:15.412 --> 27:16.956
Prue, you scared me.

27:17.122 --> 27:19.583
- Where's Phoebe?
- Upstairs.

27:19.750 --> 27:21.752
But you might wanna...

27:22.461 --> 27:24.046
...knock.

27:26.048 --> 27:27.508
Phoebe, we need to talk.

27:29.885 --> 27:32.179
Yes, we do.

27:42.689 --> 27:46.193
- You know you don't have to leave.
- Yeah, I think I should.

27:48.028 --> 27:50.030
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

27:54.451 --> 27:55.869
I hope you liked the show.

27:56.078 --> 27:58.705
Phoebe, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

27:58.914 --> 28:01.833
What, that it was my room
that you barged into?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.086
I had more privacy
when I lived in New York,

28:04.252 --> 28:07.673
a tiny island crawling
with 8 million people.

28:07.881 --> 28:10.092
And at least one thief.

28:10.258 --> 28:12.469
I'm sorry, excuse me?

28:13.512 --> 28:15.389
My new boss handed this to me,

28:15.597 --> 28:18.809
thankfully just before
the urn could be sold.

28:19.893 --> 28:23.730
Clay didn't buy it at some
outdoor bazaar, Phoebe.

28:23.897 --> 28:26.983
- He stole it.
- This can't be right.

28:27.609 --> 28:31.112
- It looks right, Pheebs.
- Seasons change. People don't.

28:31.321 --> 28:32.864
I changed.

28:33.031 --> 28:34.699
Do you remember what
you thought of me

28:34.866 --> 28:36.952
before I walked back
through that door?

28:37.160 --> 28:39.079
- That's different.
- How is that different?

28:39.287 --> 28:40.747
You're my sister.

28:44.751 --> 28:47.295
Well, there's gotta be some mistake.

28:47.504 --> 28:48.880
It gets worse.

28:50.715 --> 28:52.884
If the background information
is accurate,

28:53.051 --> 28:55.804
there's a curse attached to the urn.

28:57.138 --> 29:00.016
Anyone who steals it ends up dead,

29:00.183 --> 29:02.310
a victim of The Guardian
who protects it.

29:02.477 --> 29:03.978
And she feeds off their greed.

29:04.187 --> 29:06.773
Okay, well, even if that's true,

29:06.940 --> 29:08.983
Clay could've never known about it.

29:09.192 --> 29:11.611
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
brought it here.

29:11.778 --> 29:13.112
Are you sure, Pheebs?

29:13.321 --> 29:15.657
You wouldn't be the first Halliwell
to misjudge a guy.

29:15.865 --> 29:19.535
No, it's not about judging.
It's about knowing. And I know Clay.

29:19.702 --> 29:21.454
And I know what Clay has done.

29:22.038 --> 29:24.749
Okay, he put my job in jeopardy.
He lied to me.

29:24.916 --> 29:26.834
Phoebe, he lied to you.

29:27.752 --> 29:28.961
You don't know that.

29:30.671 --> 29:34.133
Look, I'm not saying
that he's perfect.

29:34.550 --> 29:40.431
Okay, and even if he is foolish
enough to risk his own life...

29:41.724 --> 29:43.267
...he would never risk mine.

29:58.449 --> 30:01.619
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this is a scorpion sting.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.954
A scorpion sting in San Francisco?

30:04.121 --> 30:06.707
I know, but that's what it looks like.

30:06.916 --> 30:09.293
Any chance he was killed
somewhere else and moved here?

30:09.502 --> 30:12.213
No. The lividity is consistent
with where he was found.

30:12.755 --> 30:14.215
Well, I buy this place has roaches.

30:14.381 --> 30:17.510
I'm not so sure about scorpions.
Anything else?

30:17.718 --> 30:20.262
Found someone's
business card in his pocket.

30:21.055 --> 30:23.015
Buckland's Auction House?

30:23.182 --> 30:25.017
Let me guess, Prue Halliwell?

30:25.226 --> 30:28.187
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I'm cursed.

30:29.271 --> 30:32.733
Let me know when you get
the report back on that sting.

30:37.654 --> 30:39.073
Excuse me.

30:48.123 --> 30:49.541
Palmer?

30:59.343 --> 31:07.768
Lot 49, 2600. Lot 50, 15,000.
Lot 51, excluded.

31:09.269 --> 31:11.897
Shouldn't that be turned in
to the proper authorities?

31:12.105 --> 31:14.691
I'm contacting Customs
as soon as we're finished here.

31:14.858 --> 31:19.112
Look, again I just wanna assure you
that I didn't have anything to do with...

31:19.321 --> 31:21.198
Just handle it.

31:21.656 --> 31:26.453
- How did we do?
- $1.28 million. We did it.

31:26.661 --> 31:28.872
The auction house lives
to see another day.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.292
- Congratulations. Good work.
- Thanks.

31:36.838 --> 31:38.465
Hey.

31:39.799 --> 31:41.176
Andy, hi.

31:41.343 --> 31:42.761
Here to arrest me again?

31:43.970 --> 31:46.264
Not this time.

31:47.599 --> 31:50.310
A scorpion.
Why am I not surprised?

31:51.269 --> 31:52.604
I'm afraid I don't...

31:52.812 --> 31:55.899
A young man died last night
of a scorpion sting.

31:56.107 --> 31:59.152
- Palmer Kellogg, you know him?
- I don't believe I do.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.070
Well, he obviously knew you.

32:01.237 --> 32:02.947
I found your card on his body.

32:03.698 --> 32:06.659
We did just have an auction.
I met a lot of people.

32:08.661 --> 32:11.289
Well, I'll bring a photo by later,
see if it jogs anything.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.541
That's fine.

32:18.129 --> 32:20.214
Prue, just because
we're not dating anymore,

32:20.381 --> 32:22.133
I want you to know
I still care about you.

32:23.843 --> 32:26.971
So if you're ever in a jam
or you ever need anything,

32:27.138 --> 32:28.973
just know you can always call me.

32:31.059 --> 32:33.102
I know that. Thanks.

32:46.115 --> 32:48.951
- Clay, are you in there?
- Phoebe?

32:53.414 --> 32:56.375
- You stole the urn, didn't you?
- Why don't you come inside.

32:56.584 --> 33:00.046
No, I am not going anywhere
until you answer the question.

33:00.254 --> 33:02.340
Okay, yes.

33:04.759 --> 33:09.138
Were you planning on saying
goodbye before you skipped town?

33:09.305 --> 33:10.890
Palmer's dead, Phoebe.

33:11.098 --> 33:13.809
- What?
- He died from a scorpion sting.

33:14.018 --> 33:15.561
I call Wesley to tell him.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.813
That's when his parents tell me
he's dead too.

33:18.022 --> 33:20.774
Spider bites. I don't know how,
I don't know why,

33:20.941 --> 33:22.985
but I know one thing,
I'm not gonna stick around.

33:23.152 --> 33:25.905
- You are such a liar!
- Phoebe, I'm not lying.

33:26.113 --> 33:28.741
You knew it was cursed when
you stole it. You knew the legend.

33:28.949 --> 33:30.659
What are you talking about?
What legend?

33:30.868 --> 33:34.538
Are you telling me that you didn't know
whoever steals the urn dies?

33:34.747 --> 33:36.582
Palmer, Wesley...

33:36.749 --> 33:38.375
I swear I knew nothing about it.

33:39.043 --> 33:41.587
- Yeah, right.
- Phoebe, you have to believe me.

33:41.795 --> 33:43.380
No, I don't.

33:43.547 --> 33:45.591
You're a liar, Clay.

33:45.799 --> 33:47.843
You will never change.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.054
You'll always look for
the easy way out.

34:05.485 --> 34:06.945
Sorry.

34:07.154 --> 34:09.697
- I'll go get the broom
- Good idea.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.909
I see you reversed the spell.

34:13.076 --> 34:15.829
Yeah and I've been given
until tomorrow to fire him.

34:15.996 --> 34:20.042
Maybe Prue was right.
Maybe they just don't belong together.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.377
Seems like the theme of the day.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.963
Oh, Clay?

34:25.172 --> 34:26.922
He totally used me, Piper.

34:27.090 --> 34:30.260
He just used me to get to Prue.

34:31.386 --> 34:33.263
I'm sorry.

34:34.222 --> 34:36.391
Thanks for not saying,
"I told you so."

34:39.018 --> 34:40.937
Why didn't I see it coming?

34:41.103 --> 34:43.773
- What am I, a sucker for punishment?
- No.

34:43.940 --> 34:46.318
You see the good in people
and that's never wrong.

34:46.484 --> 34:49.321
Besides, the wrong guys
are usually the most interesting.

34:51.031 --> 34:52.324
Until you get your hopes up

34:52.489 --> 34:55.118
and let your guard down, and
then they reveal their true selves.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.912
- It's so true.
- I mean, look at Doug.

34:58.121 --> 35:02.792
Great guy, kind of boring
on the surface, easy to overlook.

35:02.959 --> 35:05.587
But maybe in the long run
we're better off with his type.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.923
Maybe in the way long run.

35:09.090 --> 35:12.677
- I think I'm still looking for adventure.
- Then you risk paying the price.

35:15.555 --> 35:17.599
I got it.

35:18.433 --> 35:21.269
- Maybe it's a price worth paying.
- Yeah.

35:21.436 --> 35:23.897
I just don't know anymore.

35:24.063 --> 35:26.274
Thanks for the ear.

35:37.243 --> 35:38.661
- Can I come in?
- No.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.831
Look, I may have lied
about buying the urn,

35:41.998 --> 35:43.666
but I swear I didn't know
it was cursed.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.210
Well, that still makes you
a thief now, doesn't it?

35:46.419 --> 35:48.296
That's why I'm here.
I wanna make things right.

35:48.463 --> 35:50.673
I wanna turn myself in to the police.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.091
I mean it, Phoebe, honest.

35:52.258 --> 35:54.135
It's the only way I can
redeem myself with you.

35:54.635 --> 35:57.388
And how do I know this isn't
just another one of your scams?

35:57.597 --> 36:00.391
I guess you don't, but I don't wanna
take shortcuts anymore.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.435
I wanna take the urn
with me to the police.

36:02.602 --> 36:05.396
But there's no way Prue
is just gonna give it to me...

36:05.605 --> 36:07.440
...not without you there.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.109
I need your help.

36:10.860 --> 36:14.822
It's the last favour
I'll ever ask, I promise.

36:17.450 --> 36:18.909
I don't think so.

36:20.411 --> 36:21.954
Please.

36:29.295 --> 36:30.754
The curse.

36:30.963 --> 36:32.339
What?

36:32.506 --> 36:34.049
Let's go.

36:41.056 --> 36:43.600
- Phoebe, what is he doing here?
- Save it till later.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.769
I have seen the future,
and it's not bright.

36:45.936 --> 36:47.855
Oh, good. You didn't give
the urn to the police.

36:48.063 --> 36:49.773
No, I thought it might
get you in trouble.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.484
You know that little legend
we were talking about?

36:52.651 --> 36:54.319
Well...

36:57.322 --> 37:00.784
- I think it's true.
- What the hell is that?

37:01.410 --> 37:02.995
- Clay!
- Get him out of here.

37:03.162 --> 37:04.788
Go!

37:09.835 --> 37:12.045
I don't wanna harm you.

37:12.212 --> 37:14.631
- I came for the thief.
- Who are you?

37:14.840 --> 37:17.384
I'm The Guardian of the urn.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.636
You cannot destroy me.

37:25.017 --> 37:27.602
Phoebe. Run.

37:29.730 --> 37:32.232
So now there are more who will die.

37:44.536 --> 37:45.787
I still don't understand.

37:45.954 --> 37:47.539
You stay down here,
we'll be right back.

37:47.706 --> 37:49.666
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you in the attic.

37:49.833 --> 37:53.420
- Where are you going?
- Fill her in, I'll meet you guys upstairs.

37:54.963 --> 37:57.048
Piper is really into legends

37:57.215 --> 38:00.510
and Prue is really good
with her mind, so...

38:00.677 --> 38:03.471
Yeah, but that thing,
The Guardian, she's not even...

38:03.680 --> 38:04.764
Human? Yeah. I know.

38:04.931 --> 38:06.558
But she's real
and we have to figure out

38:06.725 --> 38:09.769
- how to stop her before she gets you.
- I don't know what you're thinking.

38:09.936 --> 38:11.980
I do not want you
getting hurt because of me.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.860
You know, I think
I actually believe you.

38:25.910 --> 38:29.163
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing about Egyptian urns

38:29.372 --> 38:31.958
or greed demons. Zip.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.252
Well, let's just hope that
she didn't follow us here

38:34.419 --> 38:36.379
because our powers
are useless against her.

38:36.546 --> 38:39.424
How is that possible? I mean,
that's never happened to us before.

38:39.590 --> 38:41.509
Maybe we're not supposed
to protect him.

38:42.051 --> 38:45.388
- What are you saying?
- Look, all I'm saying

38:45.555 --> 38:47.515
is that maybe there's a reason.

38:47.682 --> 38:50.560
Like Piper trying to force Doug
and Shelly back together again.

38:50.726 --> 38:53.187
Maybe there are some things
that we're not supposed to save.

38:53.354 --> 38:55.815
No, we're saving Clay, period.

38:55.982 --> 38:58.693
There's just gotta be
something that we're missing.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.069
Maybe this is something.

39:00.278 --> 39:03.864
It doesn't talk about the urn, but it
talks about the seven deadly sins.

39:04.031 --> 39:06.742
- Greed being one of them.
- Wait a minute.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.036
The Guardian punishes the greedy.

39:09.203 --> 39:13.833
So maybe if Clay does something
selfless, it'll even the score.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.669
Good luck.

39:19.088 --> 39:20.631
Sorry.

39:22.591 --> 39:24.260
Clay!

39:24.427 --> 39:26.262
Clay, where are you?

39:26.429 --> 39:27.847
Clay?

39:28.013 --> 39:31.475
- I think he left.
- I don't believe it.

39:31.642 --> 39:34.436
- Well, sorry, Pheebs.
- No, I mean, I really don't believe it.

39:34.603 --> 39:36.981
- He wouldn't just leave.
- You have a better explanation?

39:37.147 --> 39:39.233
He was worried about me,
he was worried about us.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.569
I'm telling you...

39:41.735 --> 39:45.990
Wait, my vision, I think I know where
he's going. We gotta stop him.

39:56.458 --> 40:00.295
I knew you'd come back.
Your greed consumes you.

40:00.462 --> 40:02.256
I'm not here for the urn.

40:03.424 --> 40:06.927
- You must be punished.
- I know.

40:07.594 --> 40:10.180
When you're done with me,
that's it, right?

40:10.347 --> 40:13.892
- You're not gonna hurt anybody else?
- Not until somebody steals the urn.

40:14.101 --> 40:15.811
How do you know anybody will?

40:15.978 --> 40:17.813
Somebody always does.

40:34.663 --> 40:36.373
- Clay!
- Stay back, Phoebe.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.959
- No!
- Phoebe, look out!

40:43.672 --> 40:46.675
<i>A selfless act.
Just like the Book of Shadows said.</i>

40:55.892 --> 40:59.145
- Where did it go?
- Who cares, as long as it's not here.

41:00.605 --> 41:02.190
Are you okay?

41:02.941 --> 41:04.859
Am I okay?

41:05.026 --> 41:08.113
Who says people never change?

41:20.708 --> 41:23.419
Good thing we didn't have to use
our powers to vanquish her,

41:23.586 --> 41:25.380
otherwise Clay would've seen it.

41:25.547 --> 41:27.006
They didn't work anyway.

41:27.173 --> 41:30.343
Not something I hope
ever happens again.

41:31.219 --> 41:32.637
I forgot about Doug.

41:34.556 --> 41:37.350
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Tell me about it.

41:37.517 --> 41:41.020
That engagement ring's probably
still burning a hole in his apron.

41:42.689 --> 41:44.649
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

41:44.816 --> 41:48.111
Solving your problem
and keeping you employed.

41:51.697 --> 41:53.491
Okay.

41:57.912 --> 41:59.914
Sorry.

42:02.458 --> 42:04.293
What's that?

42:08.089 --> 42:10.591
I was carrying that around
for weeks trying to find

42:10.758 --> 42:12.635
the right time to ask you.

42:12.802 --> 42:16.055
- Ask me what?
- To...

42:17.682 --> 42:19.058
...marry me.

42:19.684 --> 42:23.396
But that's why I broke up with you.

42:24.230 --> 42:25.898
I gave up on waiting.

42:34.031 --> 42:35.491
Maybe this would've
happened sooner

42:35.658 --> 42:38.285
if I kept my little Wicca-nose
out of their business.

42:38.452 --> 42:42.915
I guess you can't change people.
They have to change themselves.

42:43.582 --> 42:46.418
Speaking of that.

42:48.170 --> 42:49.421
- Go, baby.
- Go, girl.

42:49.588 --> 42:52.341
- All right.
- You go. You can do it.

42:54.760 --> 42:58.722
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm glad you stopped by.

42:59.473 --> 43:02.184
Any chance you're gonna
come back with me?

43:02.893 --> 43:05.312
No, this is my home now.

43:05.521 --> 43:07.731
You know me, I had to try.

43:09.108 --> 43:11.318
I know I've lied to you
about a lot of things,

43:11.527 --> 43:15.989
but one thing I never lied to you
about was how much I care about you.

43:17.157 --> 43:18.617
I know, Clay.

43:25.415 --> 43:28.418
- I guess I should be going.
- Yeah.

43:30.212 --> 43:33.548
You know, I hope
the next time we cross paths,

43:34.549 --> 43:36.843
I'll be the guy you always
think you see.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.141
Goodbye.

43:51.775 --> 43:53.443
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

43:53.610 --> 43:58.198
He was just stopping by
on his way home. No big deal.

43:58.365 --> 44:00.742
I've heard that before.
