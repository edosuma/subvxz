00:04.700 --> 00:06.000
Anyways, I was thinking,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
if you're not doing anything
this weekend,

00:08.600 --> 00:11.300
I've got two tickets
to a Blue Rain concert.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.467
Blue Rain? That's amazing!

00:14.467 --> 00:15.500
So, you like them?

00:15.500 --> 00:18.367
Never heard of them.

00:18.367 --> 00:19.734
They're this really cool band,

00:19.734 --> 00:22.033
and everyone paints
their face blue for the show.

00:22.033 --> 00:24.100
I got to paint this?

00:24.100 --> 00:26.400
Don't worry,
you'll look great.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.500
I got to get to class!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.567
Okay, bye, Devon.
Don't be late, okay, sweetie?

00:32.567 --> 00:35.000

and please, people,
a little originality.

Oh, I know,
I know what you're going to say,

02:02.734 --> 02:04.800
Mr. Halloway, but really

02:04.800 --> 02:06.233
and truly...

02:06.233 --> 02:09.300
I'm no hero, 'kay?

02:09.300 --> 02:13.000
Anyone would've sucked
out that poison.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.100
Your bravery is an inspiration
to us all. You're late.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.934
Now, sit.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.100
Rae, a snake bite?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.967
That was worse than
your quicksand excuse.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.400
I know I got to work on those,

02:25.400 --> 02:27.967
but you'll never believe
what happened in the hall.

02:27.967 --> 02:30.600
I know, we are really going
to have to do something

02:30.600 --> 02:32.300
about that snake problem. Whew!

02:32.300 --> 02:35.367
No, Chelsea, okay?

02:35.367 --> 02:36.834
I'm going

02:36.834 --> 02:38.700
to the Blue Rain concert
with Devon!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.300
(<i>both squealing </i>)

02:40.300 --> 02:43.467
You are not going to that
Blue Rain concert with Devon.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.500
Why not, Mom?

02:45.500 --> 02:48.400
Because I got a call
from your science teacher,
Mr. Halloway.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.967
He said you've been
totally distracted lately.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.133
Raven?

02:53.133 --> 02:54.800
Hah? Oh, I'm sorry, Mom,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.567
I was thinking about Devon.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.567
Raven, you need to get
your priorities straight.

02:59.567 --> 03:02.100
If you don't pass science,
there's not going to be a Devon.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.467
Mom... M-Mom, what are
you going to do to him?

03:07.834 --> 03:10.200
Not to him. To you.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.500
No Devon, no concert,

03:11.500 --> 03:13.800
no nothing, unless you pass
that science project.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.400
(<i>sighs </i>)

03:15.400 --> 03:17.100
Okay, well,

03:17.100 --> 03:18.400
I got to call Devon.

03:19.834 --> 03:23.300
And tell him I got to get
my priorities straight.

03:31.967 --> 03:34.133
Can't you just toss your junk
in the trash?

03:34.133 --> 03:36.367
You're taking
a rather simple process

03:36.367 --> 03:37.934
and overcomplicating it.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.400
No, no, no.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.467
Cory, William, look.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.900
We shred for many reasons.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.200
We shred for safety,
we shred for security,

03:44.200 --> 03:46.700
but most importantly,
we shred because it's...

03:46.700 --> 03:48.400
really, really fun.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.900
Hey, mon,

William, that's Madison
from school!

04:04.700 --> 04:08.100
She asked<i>me</i>
to borrow a video game.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.900
Is that significant?

04:09.900 --> 04:13.100
Yeah! She eats
at the cool kids' table.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.967
Aren't we cool kids?

04:14.967 --> 04:16.300
We're about<i>this </i>close,

04:16.300 --> 04:18.200
but if we get in good
with her,

04:18.200 --> 04:19.934
she'll take us over the top.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.100
But first, I got
to answer the door.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.100
Hey, Madison. Come in.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.467
What's up?

04:29.567 --> 04:31.400
Captain Brainy Pants?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.700
I prefer "William."

04:32.700 --> 04:34.300
Interesting tidbit:

04:34.300 --> 04:36.300
I'm named after my
great-great uncle,

04:36.300 --> 04:37.867

chess champion...

04:37.867 --> 04:40.000
<i>Okay. </i>Here's that game
you wanted.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.300
Thanks.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.400
Want to stay and play it?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
Or we can go outside and hang.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.934
That sounds cool.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.133
If we're hanging outside,

04:46.133 --> 04:48.567
I'll have to change
into my play clothes.

04:48.567 --> 04:49.967
What's wrong with the clothes

04:49.967 --> 04:51.300
you're wearing?
(<i>scoffs </i>)

totally second grade.

04:55.867 --> 04:57.667

04:57.667 --> 05:00.100
Are-are those rubber duckies?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.367
Don't they put a smile
on your face?

05:02.367 --> 05:03.567
Uh, no.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.934
You know...

05:05.934 --> 05:07.100
on second thought,

05:07.100 --> 05:08.600
I really have to be someplace.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.100
But you just got here.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.800
Right. And now I have to go.

05:17.500 --> 05:21.100
Your shirt just cost us

05:27.900 --> 05:29.400
Thanks for coming by,
you guys.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.667

my project by you.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.200
Put your goggles on, y'all.
Watch out.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.600
Watch out.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.367

05:48.567 --> 05:51.100
Girl, you are spacing out.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.200
Didn't you hear Mr. Halloway say
no volcanoes?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.400
When did he say that?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.033
Oh, when you were saving Timmy

05:57.033 --> 05:59.100
from that snake bite,
that's right.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.300
Well, I spent
all of my time on this.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.300
What am I supposed to do?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.667
I don't know, Rae,
but you had better
think of something,

06:05.667 --> 06:07.000
because if you don't,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.300
there is no concert,
no Devon, no love, no future.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.567
You know, you'll
end up a...

06:10.567 --> 06:15.600

with her<i>27 </i>cats.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.500
Yeah.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.767
So good luck.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.300
Thanks.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.300
Where am I going to get
another project?

06:24.667 --> 06:27.133
I'm sorry Madison
doesn't think I dress cool.

06:27.133 --> 06:30.100
I don't win fashion contests--
I win science fairs.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.000
Yo, Rae, you should get
Captain Brainy Pants over there

06:33.000 --> 06:34.300
to help you out.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.100
Please. Ha!

06:36.100 --> 06:38.467
The day I go to a little kid
for help is,

06:38.467 --> 06:40.200

06:42.467 --> 06:44.133

Oh, yeah,

06:44.133 --> 06:47.667
'cause remember,

(<i>laughs </i>)

06:57.100 --> 06:59.000
Hey,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.400
um, since you're needing
some help in the fashion area,

07:01.400 --> 07:04.000
and I may possibly need some
help with the science project,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.734
maybe you and I
could make a deal.

07:05.734 --> 07:09.133
My client and I
are listening.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.000
Okay. Well...

07:12.000 --> 07:15.100
hmm, I can give your boy
a cool makeover

07:15.100 --> 07:17.467

designed by...<i>moi...</i>

07:17.467 --> 07:22.033
if he whips me up a project
that'll help me pass science.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.133
So, by mixing these chemicals

07:26.133 --> 07:29.300
in exact proportions,
in the proper order,

07:29.300 --> 07:31.700
we can change
the molecular structure

07:31.700 --> 07:35.133
of this compound to produce...

07:38.200 --> 07:40.000
(<i>gasps </i>)

That's like a-a rainbow
in a bottle!

07:45.600 --> 07:46.934
How'd you do that?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.400
It's all in the formula.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.233
Uh-uh-uh.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.500

up right quick.

Ha! All the cool kids
are wearing it.

Okay, look, I have a design
in my head, okay?

08:30.300 --> 08:31.600
I sat down

08:31.600 --> 08:33.500
at the sewing machine,
and then...

08:33.500 --> 08:37.033
then Devon called me, and
he wanted me to listen to
this Blue Rain song...

08:37.033 --> 08:40.400
So? William did his part,
and what were you doing?

08:40.400 --> 08:42.900
Drooling over Devon.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.767
No, I wasn't.

08:47.367 --> 08:50.900
The deal...
is off the table.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.300
What?

08:59.600 --> 09:02.000
Go ahead, William,
you know what you got to do.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.233
William, no!

09:03.233 --> 09:05.767
One more step,
and this formula's confetti.

09:05.767 --> 09:08.600
You know what, William?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.300
Go ahead and shred it.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.300
You think that's gonna
make you tough?

09:12.300 --> 09:13.700
You think it's going
to make you a man?

09:13.700 --> 09:16.834
(<i>laughs </i>):
Make you cool? Please.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.867
It's worth a shot.

No...!

09:28.967 --> 09:31.300
Rae, what kind of
project is this?

09:31.300 --> 09:32.934
This looks like garbage.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.800
Eddie, come on,
don't be a project hater.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.567
Oh, y'all don't get it, okay?
I messed up.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.667
William helped me, and
I forgot to help him,

09:42.667 --> 09:43.834
so Cory got mad at me,

09:43.834 --> 09:44.867
and they shredded it.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.100
You know, it's due tomorrow,

09:46.100 --> 09:47.867
and I really need you guys
to help me

09:47.867 --> 09:49.500

10:06.767 --> 10:09.200
My face was blue;
I heard the music.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.233
I must've been at that concert
with Devon.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.834
That means it must've been
taped back together!
What?

10:13.834 --> 10:15.767
Hello? That means
you passed your science project.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.000
Yes!
Yes!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.233
Hey, congrats, Rae.
Yes, congrats.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.300
You did it, little missy.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.467
I did it! I did it!

10:22.900 --> 10:24.834
Thank you, guys!

10:24.834 --> 10:26.567
You guys are the best.
Aw.

10:26.567 --> 10:27.767
Oh, thank you.

10:27.767 --> 10:29.734
I'll see you
at school.
Okay.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.200
Yes! Whoo, yeah,
I'm going to the concert!

10:35.133 --> 10:37.300

What do you think?
Totally duck-free.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.767
Man, take that shirt
out your pants.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.700
That's not cool.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.000
My mom pinned it
to my underwear.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.600
You're killing me, William.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.133
Madison will be
here any minute.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.000

What's happening, Cory?

11:12.100 --> 11:15.600
He was tucked and pinned!

11:15.600 --> 11:17.400
Let me get this straight.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.967
You want to be friends
with someone who makes fun

11:19.967 --> 11:21.100
of your best friend?

11:21.100 --> 11:22.767
Yes.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.133
No.

11:24.133 --> 11:27.500
Are you trying
to make me think?

11:27.500 --> 11:28.600
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)

11:28.600 --> 11:30.033
Don't think too much.

to answer.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.500
Hey, Cory.

Cool shirt.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.033
Hey, you know how I do.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Where's Captain
Brainy Pants?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Oh, I forgot.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.567
It must be nap time.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.800
He's not a bad guy

11:51.800 --> 11:53.467
once you get
to know him.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.100
What are you trying
to say?

11:55.100 --> 11:56.900
I don't know.
I'm still thinking.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.834
Listen, Cory,
you could be cool,

12:00.834 --> 12:03.233
but if you stick up
for him,

12:03.233 --> 12:05.400
then that makes you
a nerd, too.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.233
Okay, I'm done thinking.

12:10.233 --> 12:13.600
If being cool means
dissing my friends,

12:13.600 --> 12:14.834
then I don't want
to be cool.

12:16.934 --> 12:19.734
You were this close
to sitting at our table.

12:19.734 --> 12:23.467
And you are this close
to the door.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.200
Let me show you out
nerd style.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.400
You are making
a big mistake.

we will hear from
Raven Baxter.

Chelsea, my dad's not here
with the formula yet.

You have to stall.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.567
Before we start
with that project,

16:14.567 --> 16:16.867
which we are getting to,
Mr. Halloway,

16:16.867 --> 16:20.734
I got a crazy chemistry joke
for y'all.

16:20.734 --> 16:25.367
What did the beaker
say to the test tube?

16:25.367 --> 16:27.900
"You're getting an 'F'."

16:27.900 --> 16:29.467
You heard this before.

16:29.467 --> 16:32.700
Don't ruin it for the people.
Don't ruin it for the people.

16:34.033 --> 16:35.300
That's cool.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.700
But seriously, people,
seriously, all right

16:37.700 --> 16:39.233
let's get a kronk up in here.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.100
(<i>different pitches sounding </i>)

16:44.700 --> 16:46.200

17:18.367 --> 17:20.467

17:20.467 --> 17:23.200
At what point
do you plan to alter

17:23.200 --> 17:25.000
the chemical properties
of a given solution,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.200
thereby producing

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
a complete spectrum
of primary colors?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.367
Raven's going to do what?

17:34.734 --> 17:37.300
Oh, Mr. Halloway!

17:37.300 --> 17:41.033
You're talking about
rainbow in a bottle.

17:41.033 --> 17:43.467
I'm getting to that.

17:43.467 --> 17:46.300
This was just... a warm-up.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.734
Maybe I'll get lucky.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.567
Right. A dash of this.

17:57.567 --> 17:58.600
This is what we need.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.300
Set that up.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.767
Ooh, Devon has a shirt
this color.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.767
Ooh, these are pretty.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.967

We're getting something, people!

18:13.400 --> 18:16.200
We are... clearly,
we're getting something.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.700
Clearly.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.600
Look. It looks like science
to me, people.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.700
It looks like science.

Ooh, you guys, it looks
so scientifical.

unstable chemical reaction!

like, what, a "C"?

not going anywhere
for a long time.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300

this blue's not going
to fade for another two days.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.400
I hope you learned
your lesson.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.500
Yeah, don't go back
for the tuna.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.600
I know, okay.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.100
I was so caught up
in having a boyfriend

19:30.100 --> 19:31.667
that I forgot about
everything else.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.967
And I'm really, really sorry.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.900
And what about William
doing your science project?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.567
Oh, and that was wrong, too.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.600
Oh, and again,
I am so, so sorry.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.600
But am I ever going
to see Devon again?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.033

19:46.033 --> 19:47.767
and make up
your science project

19:47.767 --> 19:50.100
and do your extra credit
for Mr. Halloway,

19:50.100 --> 19:51.500
then we'll talk about it.

Victor, how you feeling?

19:53.133 --> 19:54.867

20:31.300 --> 20:34.000
Devon, what are you doing
down there?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.033
Well, I figured

20:35.033 --> 20:36.467
if you couldn't go
to the concert,

20:36.467 --> 20:38.400
then I'll bring
the concert to you.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.367
Devon, I love that you did that,

20:44.367 --> 20:46.233
but if I'm ever going
to see you again,

20:46.233 --> 20:47.934
I got to get back to work, okay?

20:55.734 --> 20:57.734
Just one more look.

21:18.133 --> 21:21.834

I finished my project.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.000
Rae, I thought
you turned

21:23.000 --> 21:24.300
your science project
in already.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.567
Oh, oh, I did.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.033
This is my other project.

21:27.033 --> 21:28.300
William, come on down.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.767
Come on, Big William.

21:35.233 --> 21:37.000
William, check you out.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.500
Yes, check me out.
