<i>EMMA: A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister,</i>

00:03.241 --> 00:05.042
<i>and then she asked me to take her place,</i>

00:05.136 --> 00:07.404
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother,</i>

00:07.438 --> 00:09.406
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:09.440 --> 00:11.975
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.010 --> 00:14.311
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

00:14.313 --> 00:16.947
- There's still no sign of Theresa.
- I'm sure she's okay.

00:16.981 --> 00:18.915
<i>We are not going to be
having a wedding today.</i>

00:18.950 --> 00:20.717
- She got too close.
- What are you talking about?

00:20.752 --> 00:22.019
Derek's killer.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.954
Theresa finds out about the
blackmail money, and then

00:23.988 --> 00:26.723
disappears a few days later?
That doesn't look good for Ted.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.825
- If Ted is responsible for this...
- I just need time.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.527
Give me one night. Tonight.

00:30.561 --> 00:31.528
Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you,

00:31.562 --> 00:33.297
and your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.

00:33.331 --> 00:35.299
I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.

00:38.236 --> 00:40.203
I dropped my hospital keycard somewhere.

00:40.238 --> 00:41.204
Do you guys know where it is?

00:41.239 --> 00:43.140
You're going to a hotel with Alec?

00:43.174 --> 00:44.341
That's none of your business.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.243
Are you spying on me?

00:46.277 --> 00:48.812
- Get out now, before I call the police.
- I'm sorry.

00:48.846 --> 00:50.047
- So where is she?
- I don't know.

00:50.081 --> 00:52.049
But when I find the person
who took her from me,

00:52.083 --> 00:54.751
I'm gonna kill him.

00:55.687 --> 00:56.820
Looking for this?

01:01.484 --> 01:02.818
Sutton, what are you doing here?

01:02.852 --> 01:04.653
I think the more important question is

01:04.687 --> 01:07.322
what are you doing here? Why is this here?

01:07.357 --> 01:08.657
Honey, it's not how it looks. I...

01:08.691 --> 01:10.459
No...

01:10.493 --> 01:12.361
You're really afraid of me?

01:12.395 --> 01:14.530
No...

01:14.564 --> 01:18.000
No, I...

01:18.034 --> 01:19.435
I just want to understand.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.972
Look, I've done things,

01:24.007 --> 01:25.774
Sutton, I've made mistakes,

01:25.809 --> 01:27.743
but always to protect my family.

01:27.777 --> 01:28.944
You, Laurel, your mother...

01:28.978 --> 01:30.112
I would... I could never hurt you.

01:30.146 --> 01:32.748
What about other people?

01:32.782 --> 01:34.550
Wh...

01:34.584 --> 01:35.818
Did you hurt Theresa?

01:35.852 --> 01:36.885
God, no.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.554
You've known me your entire life.

01:38.588 --> 01:39.788
Is that the kind of man you think I am?

01:39.823 --> 01:41.490
I just need to hear it from you,

01:41.524 --> 01:43.358
and I... I just... I need
to know what is going on.

01:43.393 --> 01:44.460
Can you just tell me?

01:46.663 --> 01:48.630
I don't know where to begin.

01:48.665 --> 01:50.299
Well, maybe you should start by telling me

01:50.333 --> 01:51.467
why you're at Derek Roger's grave.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.037
(sighs)

01:55.071 --> 01:57.139
Derek stumbled across some information,

01:57.173 --> 01:59.041
and was using it to blackmail me.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.109
What kind of information?

02:02.245 --> 02:04.146
It's something I never told you,

02:04.180 --> 02:06.715
and it's something I selfishly
hoped that you'd never find out.

02:06.749 --> 02:08.984
Honey...

02:10.553 --> 02:13.822
Rebecca Sewell is your birth mother.

02:15.425 --> 02:17.392
I know.

02:17.427 --> 02:18.494
What?

02:18.528 --> 02:19.628
You know?

02:19.662 --> 02:21.330
How do you know that?

02:21.364 --> 02:22.531
It doesn't matter.

02:22.565 --> 02:25.133
Who is my birth father?

02:26.269 --> 02:27.336
Please.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.304
Just say it.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.008
It's me.

02:34.878 --> 02:37.079
Sutton, I'm...

02:37.113 --> 02:38.981
I'm your dad.

So when Alec told me that

03:03.907 --> 03:06.575
Rebecca was placing you
for adoption, I panicked.

03:06.609 --> 03:08.644
I knew if your mother
found out about the affair,

03:08.678 --> 03:10.712
she'd leave me, but then
I also knew I couldn't...

03:10.747 --> 03:12.614
I couldn't lose you.

03:12.649 --> 03:14.750
So Alec knew everything?

03:14.784 --> 03:17.019
Alec, he... he's the one that
arranged your whole adoption.

03:17.194 --> 03:19.696
Under the table, of course,

03:19.730 --> 03:22.131
and I know that was wrong,
but how could I regret that?

03:22.166 --> 03:24.167
It gave me you.

03:24.201 --> 03:27.136
I just...

03:27.171 --> 03:29.939
I never thought we'd end up here.

03:29.973 --> 03:32.075
I just want you to promise me

03:32.109 --> 03:34.010
that you've told me everything.

03:34.044 --> 03:35.912
I swear to God.

03:38.048 --> 03:41.050
How did Derek know that
you were my birth father?

03:41.085 --> 03:43.186
I don't know.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.088
I know Alec mentored him at one point,

03:45.122 --> 03:46.856
so I just figured he overheard something.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.991
I figured I'd just pay
him a few hundred bucks

03:49.026 --> 03:51.160
and he'd go away, but then
he just kept coming back,

03:51.195 --> 03:53.830
every week, and he would ask for more.

03:53.864 --> 03:55.998
I mean, at the end, I had paid him...

03:56.033 --> 03:57.767
$20,000?

03:57.801 --> 04:00.903
Yes. Yes.

04:00.938 --> 04:02.872
And I was about to go to the cops

04:02.906 --> 04:04.006
when I saw on the news

04:04.041 --> 04:05.842
that somebody killed him.

04:05.876 --> 04:07.977
And I told myself that
had nothing to do with me,

04:08.011 --> 04:09.912
that Derek had just pushed
the wrong guy too far.

04:09.947 --> 04:12.782
And there was a part
of me that was relieved.

04:12.816 --> 04:15.084
But then I started
thinking, he's just a kid.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.887
He's the same age as you.

04:18.922 --> 04:21.690
That's why you were leaving
flowers at his grave.

04:21.725 --> 04:23.926
Yeah.

04:23.961 --> 04:25.862
That's where I ran into Theresa,

04:25.896 --> 04:27.697
and she asked so many questions last night,

04:27.731 --> 04:29.866
I thought for sure I was
going to be arrested today.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.835
She must have disappeared right after that.

04:32.870 --> 04:35.004
Why didn't you say anything to anybody?

04:35.038 --> 04:36.739
I don't know.

04:36.774 --> 04:39.108
I've been keeping secrets
for so long, I just...

04:39.143 --> 04:40.743
I've stopped thinking clearly.

04:40.778 --> 04:42.145
But I swear...

04:42.179 --> 04:44.714
tomorrow morning, first thing,

04:44.748 --> 04:46.015
I will go to Dan.

04:46.049 --> 04:47.850
I will tell him everything.

05:06.837 --> 05:09.005
(door creaks open)

05:14.178 --> 05:16.012
- LAUREL: Hey.
- Hey.

05:16.046 --> 05:17.947
What time is it?

05:17.981 --> 05:19.749
It's late.

05:19.783 --> 05:20.883
What's Mads doing here?

05:20.918 --> 05:22.819
She said that, uh,

05:22.853 --> 05:24.720
there was some weird
stuff going on with Jordan,

05:24.755 --> 05:25.822
so she spent the night.

05:25.856 --> 05:27.757
We fell asleep waiting for you.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.358
Where have you been?

05:29.393 --> 05:31.460
I was with Dad.

05:31.495 --> 05:32.628
At the club?

05:32.663 --> 05:34.463
At the cemetery.

05:34.498 --> 05:37.200
Okay, already hating this story.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.302
No, no, no, no, it's great.

05:39.336 --> 05:41.204
It's, um...

05:41.238 --> 05:44.240
I asked him if he was my birth father,

05:44.274 --> 05:45.308
and he said yes.

05:45.342 --> 05:47.009
You're kidding.

05:47.044 --> 05:49.011
I mean... we suspected it, but...

05:49.046 --> 05:50.847
I know, but he confirmed it, Laurel.

05:50.881 --> 05:51.948
We're sisters.

05:51.982 --> 05:53.149
What?

05:53.183 --> 05:54.917
We're related by blood.

05:54.952 --> 05:56.752
Oh, just hearing it...

05:56.787 --> 05:59.689
(squeals)

05:59.723 --> 06:02.658
MADS: It's 3:00 a.m.

06:02.693 --> 06:03.793
Why are people hugging?

06:05.829 --> 06:08.331
What's Thayer doing here?

06:08.365 --> 06:09.532
Um... I don't know.

06:09.566 --> 06:11.734
Go back to sleep.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.406
What are you doing here?

06:17.441 --> 06:18.507
I was worried.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.309
Your dad freaks out, then you run out

06:20.344 --> 06:22.044
in the middle of the night looking for him?

06:22.079 --> 06:23.346
I'm sorry.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.947
I should have called you.

06:24.982 --> 06:26.182
I...

06:26.216 --> 06:27.950
It was really sweet of you to worry.

06:27.985 --> 06:29.952
So are you going to tell me what happened?

06:38.896 --> 06:41.697
Late night?

06:41.732 --> 06:43.666
Yeah, I stayed over at the Mercer's.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.768
- You got my message, right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:45.802 --> 06:47.403
Do me a favor, honey.

06:47.437 --> 06:49.639
Next time, call.

06:49.673 --> 06:51.274
Don't text.

06:51.308 --> 06:52.708
Got it.

06:52.743 --> 06:56.245
Look, Dad, I actually
wanted to ask you something.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.546
Anything.

06:57.646 --> 06:59.413
Well, I talked to Jordan.

06:59.448 --> 07:01.182
He told me what you have
him doing with Rebecca.

07:01.216 --> 07:03.150
Spying?

07:04.252 --> 07:06.320
He's not much of a spy, is he?

07:06.355 --> 07:08.189
Can't seem to keep his mouth shut.

07:08.223 --> 07:10.958
He knows about the twins.

07:12.761 --> 07:14.929
You don't seem surprised.

07:14.963 --> 07:16.630
I'm not.

07:16.665 --> 07:17.999
Rebecca told him, I'm sure.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.800
Okay, Dad, what is going on?

07:19.835 --> 07:21.602
Because if Rebecca is
really that dangerous,

07:21.636 --> 07:22.770
then what are we doing living in her house?

07:22.804 --> 07:25.873
You have to trust me.

07:25.907 --> 07:29.577
I've never do anything to put
you in danger, you know that.

07:29.611 --> 07:32.613
The safest place you can be is with me.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.426
- Ethan, hi. Look...
- So you asked me for one night,

07:45.460 --> 07:47.928
and I gave it to you.

07:47.963 --> 07:50.031
- Did you talk to Ted?
- I did.

07:50.065 --> 07:51.132
- And?
- He didn't do it.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.167
He came clean about everything.

07:53.201 --> 07:55.069
About how Derek blackmailed him,

07:55.103 --> 07:58.105
Alec and the adoption, how...

07:59.875 --> 08:03.844
Okay, he did see Theresa at Derek's grave.

08:03.879 --> 08:05.579
Wait, what?

08:05.614 --> 08:07.515
But... but he just talked
to her, and then she left.

08:07.549 --> 08:08.816
He didn't hurt anybody, I swear.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.651
Oh, really? Is that what he said?

08:10.685 --> 08:12.586
I...

08:12.621 --> 08:15.389
I trusted you with this.
Okay? I gave you that time,

08:15.424 --> 08:17.358
and now, for all I know, Theresa
could be dead because of it.

08:17.392 --> 08:19.326
- Wait, where are you going?
- Where do you think?

08:19.361 --> 08:21.228
To talk to Dan. Ted said he was going

08:21.263 --> 08:22.463
directly to Dan first thing this morning.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.267
- He's innocent, Ethan.
- He better be.

08:31.807 --> 08:32.873
Should I be calling a lawyer?

08:32.908 --> 08:35.009
Why?

08:36.711 --> 08:37.812
Just two guys talking, here.

08:37.846 --> 08:39.947
Right?

08:39.981 --> 08:41.048
Yeah.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.551
Besides...

08:47.889 --> 08:49.824
I'd really like to hear your story again.

08:49.858 --> 08:53.461
I already told you everything I know, Dan.

08:53.495 --> 08:56.297
Well, maybe a little...

08:56.331 --> 08:57.398
repetition...

08:57.432 --> 09:00.234
will jog your memory?

09:00.268 --> 09:01.435
Okay.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.070
Um... well, like I said,

09:03.105 --> 09:05.106
I was at the cemetery leaving flowers.

09:05.140 --> 09:09.210
What... time were you at the cemetery?

09:09.244 --> 09:11.011
Time?

09:11.046 --> 09:14.715
I... I don't know if I can
remember the exact time.

09:14.749 --> 09:16.050
Well, you better damn
well start remembering

09:16.084 --> 09:17.785
really quickly.

09:17.819 --> 09:19.954
I want to know

09:19.988 --> 09:21.822
everything that happened that night.

09:21.857 --> 09:23.724
I want to know the route that you took,

09:23.758 --> 09:26.660
I want to know what kind
of flowers you left there,

09:26.695 --> 09:28.696
I want to know what they smelled like!

09:28.730 --> 09:30.598
- Dan...
- I want to shut your mouth.

09:30.632 --> 09:33.467
I want to know the exact
time that Theresa got there,

09:33.502 --> 09:35.302
and every damn thing
that happened after that.

09:35.337 --> 09:36.303
- Do you understand me?
- I have told you everything, Dan.

09:36.338 --> 09:37.605
You have told me nothing!

09:37.639 --> 09:39.440
- Dan, I didn't...
- Tell me where she is, or I will

09:39.474 --> 09:41.208
rip your throat right out
of your neck right now.

09:41.243 --> 09:42.443
- Tell me where she is.
- I didn't hurt her!

09:42.477 --> 09:44.044
Every second you spend...

09:44.079 --> 09:45.946
ALEC: Hey. (gasping)

09:45.981 --> 09:47.047
ALEC: Danny.

09:47.082 --> 09:49.283
What are you doing here, Alec?

09:49.317 --> 09:52.052
I'm saving you from making a
terrible mistake, it looks like.

09:52.087 --> 09:54.755
ALEC: Step away from the good doctor, Dan.

09:54.789 --> 09:56.790
- This doesn't involve you.
- The hell it doesn't.

09:56.825 --> 09:59.793
I'm still the District
Attorney around here.

09:59.828 --> 10:01.595
Besides, you're barking up the wrong tree.

10:01.630 --> 10:02.730
He didn't do it.

10:02.764 --> 10:03.898
How do you know?

10:03.932 --> 10:06.467
Look at him.

10:06.501 --> 10:08.636
We've known each other
since we were nine years old.

10:08.670 --> 10:11.539
He's got lots of flaws,
but he's not a killer.

10:11.573 --> 10:14.575
Then why does nothing
about this man's story

10:14.609 --> 10:17.244
seem to add up to me?

10:17.279 --> 10:19.413
He's telling me that he's being blackmailed

10:19.447 --> 10:21.215
because he's Sutton's

10:21.249 --> 10:23.150
- biological father.
- He is.

10:23.185 --> 10:25.419
And you're saying to me

10:25.453 --> 10:27.221
that someone cares enough about that

10:27.255 --> 10:28.322
to kill someone.

10:28.356 --> 10:30.191
(sighs)

10:30.225 --> 10:31.792
Who?

10:31.826 --> 10:34.895
Unfortunately, my... my wife.

10:36.031 --> 10:37.798
R... Rebecca?

10:37.872 --> 10:40.007
She's fallen in love with Ted.

10:40.041 --> 10:43.577
Isn't that right?

10:43.612 --> 10:45.779
She found out that Derek
was trying to blackmail him,

10:45.814 --> 10:47.615
and she took care of it.

10:47.649 --> 10:48.782
I think, if I'm not mistaken,

10:48.817 --> 10:50.417
she's got something to do

10:50.452 --> 10:51.619
with Theresa's disappearance, too.

10:51.653 --> 10:53.254
What proof do you have?

10:53.288 --> 10:54.455
Not enough.

10:54.489 --> 10:55.489
Not yet.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.425
I'm getting there.

10:58.460 --> 11:01.161
Why don't you apologize to Ted?

11:01.196 --> 11:03.264
Offer to give him a ride home.

11:03.298 --> 11:05.199
Maybe he won't press charges.

11:13.942 --> 11:16.810
Now, you find your own damn way home.

11:41.022 --> 11:42.123
<i>SUTTON: So...</i>

11:42.157 --> 11:43.991
he just blurted out those words:

11:44.025 --> 11:45.059
"I'm your father"?

11:45.093 --> 11:46.827
Yeah, pretty much.

11:46.862 --> 11:47.862
I've waited

11:47.896 --> 11:49.597
17 years to hear that,

11:49.631 --> 11:51.632
and when it finally happens...

11:51.666 --> 11:53.634
I'm not even there.

11:53.668 --> 11:56.604
I'm really sorry, Sutton.

11:56.638 --> 11:58.405
I'm sure

11:58.440 --> 12:00.307
he'll say it again, especially if he ever

12:00.342 --> 12:01.342
finds out we're twins.

12:01.376 --> 12:03.410
And...

12:03.445 --> 12:05.579
you're sure Dad doesn't
know about that. Positive.

12:05.614 --> 12:09.316
Well, then Alec must've
just split us up on his own.

12:09.351 --> 12:12.286
Wait... wait... Alec split us up?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.988
LAUREL: Why would he do that?

12:14.022 --> 12:16.090
No offense, guys.

12:16.124 --> 12:18.125
But at some point, you're
going to have to stop

12:18.160 --> 12:20.794
being surprised by things that man did in the mid
-'90s.

12:20.829 --> 12:21.996
More importantly,

12:22.030 --> 12:24.031
we need to prove...

12:24.065 --> 12:26.066
that Rebecca was the one who took Theresa.

12:27.669 --> 12:29.570
You're right.

12:29.604 --> 12:32.873
Well, look at my big sisters
agreeing with each other.

12:32.908 --> 12:34.475
So, maybe you two should,

12:34.509 --> 12:35.576
I don't know,

12:35.610 --> 12:37.545
work together?

12:37.579 --> 12:40.347
Well, that's what I said, but...

12:40.382 --> 12:41.615
didn't want to.

12:41.650 --> 12:43.484
Because I didn't want
to tell you about Ted,

12:43.518 --> 12:45.252
- but now I...
- Then I think

12:45.287 --> 12:48.022
you two should hug and make it official.

12:48.056 --> 12:50.157
Laurel, I... (sighs)

12:52.194 --> 12:54.261
Come on.

12:55.263 --> 12:57.264
(groans)

12:57.299 --> 13:00.067
Go on.

13:00.101 --> 13:02.736
Well, let's... I mean, let's just...

13:02.771 --> 13:03.704
(mumbles)

13:03.738 --> 13:04.838
Okay, that's great.

13:04.873 --> 13:06.807
Okay, not great.

13:06.841 --> 13:09.610
- We'll work on it.
- Well, what do we do now?

13:09.644 --> 13:11.779
Well, I think one of us
needs to talk to Rebecca

13:11.813 --> 13:13.514
and try and get her to spill.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.616
And...

13:15.650 --> 13:17.351
I think we both know which one

13:17.385 --> 13:19.320
of us it should be.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.454
Kristin, do you have a second?

13:30.488 --> 13:33.157
Actually I'm kind of late
for class. Can it wait?

13:33.191 --> 13:36.226
No, it... it can't wait.

13:36.261 --> 13:38.996
Are you having an affair with my husband?

13:40.965 --> 13:44.001
No, I'm not, and where do you,

13:44.035 --> 13:46.837
of all people, get off
accusing me of infidelity?

13:46.871 --> 13:50.808
Princess Kristin, so high and mighty,

13:50.842 --> 13:52.943
what does it feel like to be

13:52.977 --> 13:54.712
just as dirty as the rest of us, huh?

13:54.746 --> 13:55.979
ALEC: Ladies!

13:56.014 --> 13:57.948
(laughs) Oh, Alec.

13:57.982 --> 13:59.550
- Yeah.
- Just in time.

13:59.584 --> 14:00.718
I was about to tell Kristin

14:00.752 --> 14:02.586
how I saw you kissing the other day.

14:04.656 --> 14:06.557
Oh.

14:06.591 --> 14:08.392
That.

14:08.426 --> 14:10.327
Yeah, that.

14:10.362 --> 14:13.330
Sweetheart, look, I mean, it meant nothing.

14:13.365 --> 14:15.265
It was inappropriate.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.201
Kristin and I are old friends.

14:17.235 --> 14:20.170
It was a moment that...

14:20.205 --> 14:21.905
got carried away.

14:21.940 --> 14:24.174
Alec's right, Rebecca.

14:24.209 --> 14:25.843
It meant nothing.

14:25.877 --> 14:28.145
Excuse me.

14:28.179 --> 14:30.948
Well, I guess we cleared that up.

14:30.982 --> 14:34.618
So, do we know what happened with Theresa?

14:34.652 --> 14:36.653
I have my theories.

14:36.688 --> 14:37.888
(phone ringing)

14:37.922 --> 14:41.625
You should probably get that.

14:41.659 --> 14:44.595
Tell Ted I said hello.

14:52.303 --> 14:55.105
Thank you.

14:55.140 --> 14:56.440
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

14:56.474 --> 14:58.008
Did you find something on Theresa?

14:58.042 --> 14:59.943
No hard evidence at the moment,

14:59.978 --> 15:03.280
but (sighs) Alec thinks
that Rebecca is involved.

15:03.314 --> 15:05.082
So we're now looking into that.

15:06.184 --> 15:08.185
Um...

15:08.219 --> 15:11.021
I heard Ted was coming
by to talk to you today.

15:11.055 --> 15:13.056
Oh, yeah. He stopped by.

15:13.091 --> 15:14.992
Apparently,

15:15.026 --> 15:18.462
he did see Theresa before she disappeared.

15:23.768 --> 15:25.702
How did you know he came by?

15:27.272 --> 15:29.106
Sutton told me.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.309
And?

15:35.046 --> 15:37.014
(exhales)

15:37.048 --> 15:38.882
Ethan.

15:40.018 --> 15:41.051
How long have you known?

15:41.085 --> 15:42.820
I didn't know...

15:42.854 --> 15:45.789
until this morning that
Ted was at the cemetery.

15:45.824 --> 15:46.957
But...

15:46.991 --> 15:48.625
Oh, yeah? But what?

15:49.961 --> 15:51.528
What?

15:53.398 --> 15:56.633
Ted didn't come home the
night Theresa disappeared,

15:56.668 --> 15:59.303
and... and Sutton was worried it
was gonna make him look guilty,

15:59.337 --> 16:01.305
and I told her I'd give her just until

16:01.339 --> 16:04.241
today to sort everything out.

16:04.275 --> 16:07.044
And you chose her over me?

16:07.078 --> 16:09.413
I don't think he did anything, man.

16:09.447 --> 16:13.016
That is not a call for you to make.

16:16.254 --> 16:18.222
You are my brother,

16:18.256 --> 16:24.027
and I asked you if you knew anything

16:24.062 --> 16:26.964
and you lied right to my face.

16:29.634 --> 16:30.901
I know.

16:30.935 --> 16:32.603
I'm sorry.

16:32.637 --> 16:35.606
You get the hell out of my office.

16:36.808 --> 16:37.774
And when I get home tonight,

16:37.809 --> 16:40.244
you better not be there.

16:43.201 --> 16:45.068
<i>THAYER: So, Ethan never told his brother?</i>

16:45.103 --> 16:47.004
<i>EMMA: No, and fortunately it bought me</i>

16:47.038 --> 16:49.273
enough time to talk to my dad.

16:49.437 --> 16:51.071
Well, I got to hand it to him.

16:51.105 --> 16:52.205
He really had your back.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.308
Just like you have a million times.

16:54.342 --> 16:56.176
(doorbell rings) Would you
mind getting that, please?

16:56.210 --> 16:57.911
Yup.

16:59.147 --> 17:00.881
(whistles)

17:03.087 --> 17:05.021
Hey.

17:05.056 --> 17:06.923
Is Emma here?

17:06.958 --> 17:08.759
Yeah, she is.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.660
EMMA: Hey!

17:10.694 --> 17:12.061
What's going on?

17:16.701 --> 17:19.469
Dan found out that I
didn't tell him about Ted,

17:19.503 --> 17:21.438
so he threw me out.

17:21.472 --> 17:22.839
Hey, Ethan.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.508
Is everything okay?

17:24.541 --> 17:27.377
Dan kicked him out.

17:27.411 --> 17:28.444
Oh, my God.

17:28.479 --> 17:30.647
What... what happened?

17:32.683 --> 17:36.419
Um, as you can imagine,
things have just been really

17:36.454 --> 17:38.388
chaotic over there lately.

17:38.422 --> 17:41.124
Of course, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

17:41.159 --> 17:43.927
Well, look, you're always
welcome to stay on the couch.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.962
Um...

17:45.997 --> 17:47.798
if it's okay with Sutton.

17:55.943 --> 17:57.076
<i>Well, I got to say, Sutton, I
was a little surprised to hear</i>

17:57.215 --> 17:58.849
that you wanted to see me,

17:58.884 --> 18:01.052
considering how things
were left the other day.

18:01.236 --> 18:04.171
Well, I felt really bad about that, uh...

18:04.206 --> 18:06.674
Of course...

18:06.708 --> 18:07.808
we're family.

18:07.843 --> 18:09.009
Mm-hmm.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.010
Sweetheart,

18:10.045 --> 18:12.613
you really shouldn't leave

18:12.647 --> 18:15.716
your valuables laying around...
that's how things disappear.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.384
Let me help you.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.420
Can you get your hair?

18:25.454 --> 18:28.156
(sighs)

18:28.190 --> 18:29.357
You know what?

18:29.392 --> 18:32.026
I'll just do it.

18:32.061 --> 18:33.962
Speaking of family...

18:33.996 --> 18:36.731
I have to ask you something.

18:36.766 --> 18:38.800
Okay.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.903
Remember the other day when I said...

18:43.706 --> 18:45.807
whoever Derek was blackmailing is probably

18:45.841 --> 18:47.776
the person who killed him?

18:47.810 --> 18:49.577
Not this again.

18:49.612 --> 18:51.379
Well, I just... I need to know.

18:51.414 --> 18:54.482
I asked you if it was my
dad you were protecting.

18:54.517 --> 18:57.252
You said you were joking about that.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.522
But what if I wasn't?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.490
What if I'm

19:02.525 --> 19:04.426
actually worried?

19:04.460 --> 19:06.261
That your father is a killer?

19:06.295 --> 19:09.164
No.

19:09.198 --> 19:11.933
Not him.

19:14.036 --> 19:15.637
Me.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.909
(laughs) Well... so you think

19:20.943 --> 19:24.846
that I had something to do
with Derek's death, or...

19:24.880 --> 19:26.614
Theresa's disappearance?

19:28.350 --> 19:30.618
All I'm saying is that if...

19:30.653 --> 19:32.253
if you did...

19:34.190 --> 19:37.492
you can tell me.

19:37.526 --> 19:40.061
I'm your daughter.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.065
I know.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.801
That's what makes it so heartbreaking.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.609
(door opens)

19:56.009 --> 19:59.578
I know it's kind of
awkward, but it shouldn't be.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.413
I'm with you.

20:01.448 --> 20:03.449
Yeah, yeah, and I know

20:03.483 --> 20:05.617
Ethan's going through
a lot right now, but...

20:05.652 --> 20:08.554
why doesn't he just
stay with me at the club?

20:08.588 --> 20:10.456
(laughs)

20:10.490 --> 20:12.424
After the way you guys
were beating each other up

20:12.459 --> 20:14.226
the other day, I don' think so.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.296
Thayer, can you please
just be okay with this?

20:17.330 --> 20:19.264
It's just for a couple of days.

20:19.299 --> 20:20.232
Fine.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.201
Fine, you're right.

20:22.235 --> 20:24.069
Thank you.

20:27.941 --> 20:29.208
I'll see you later.

20:29.242 --> 20:31.810
Hey, for what it's worth,

20:31.845 --> 20:33.078
you don't have anything to worry about.

20:33.112 --> 20:36.882
Touch her and you will.

20:40.787 --> 20:43.555
(scoffs)

20:50.838 --> 20:52.472
Ted?

20:52.507 --> 20:53.840
It's Rebecca.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.510
I got your call.

20:56.544 --> 21:00.280
They said at the desk that you were here.

21:00.314 --> 21:03.416
Ted? (knocks on door)

21:05.353 --> 21:08.088
You seemed pretty upset
when I came by yesterday.

21:08.222 --> 21:10.190
Are you okay?

21:10.224 --> 21:12.425
Ted?

21:16.297 --> 21:18.298
(sighs)

21:22.103 --> 21:24.004
(groans)

21:45.593 --> 21:47.560
Can't sleep?

21:47.595 --> 21:50.130
I was just making some tea.

21:50.164 --> 21:52.065
You want some?

21:52.099 --> 21:54.401
No, thanks.

21:54.435 --> 21:56.369
Emma, I just wanted to tell you that

21:56.404 --> 21:59.839
I appreciate you letting me stay here.

21:59.874 --> 22:02.008
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's okay.

22:02.043 --> 22:05.712
I feel so responsible for everything

22:05.746 --> 22:07.747
that happened with Dan.

22:07.782 --> 22:11.017
Ethan, it was, it was really wrong of me

22:11.052 --> 22:13.553
to ask you to not tell him about Ted.

22:13.587 --> 22:17.557
I did what I did because
I wanted to help you.

22:17.591 --> 22:20.393
Why?

22:20.428 --> 22:21.628
You said it yourself.

22:23.631 --> 22:27.567
Emma, even though we're
not together anymore,

22:27.601 --> 22:30.971
what we had meant everything to me.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.008
In some ways it still does.

22:38.813 --> 22:41.881
I... I wish things could go
back to the way they were.

22:41.916 --> 22:47.587
You know, like, before
Theresa disappeared, and...

22:52.493 --> 22:53.593
Ethan...

22:58.366 --> 22:59.332
Oh! Ooh!

22:59.367 --> 23:01.234
Ah! Oh! He hey.

23:01.268 --> 23:03.436
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. No, it's just really hot.

23:03.471 --> 23:06.106
- Let me get it.
- No. It's, I'm fine. You sure?

23:06.140 --> 23:08.074
Yeah, I'm gonna go back,
I'm gonna go back to bed.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.692
(gasps)

23:25.726 --> 23:28.428
So I talked to Rebecca.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.603
Okay, well, how did it go?

23:36.637 --> 23:38.238
Mm, not great.

23:38.272 --> 23:40.240
I basically accused her of everything:

23:40.224 --> 23:43.059
Derek's murder, Theresa's disappearance.

23:43.094 --> 23:44.294
She totally stonewalled.

23:44.328 --> 23:46.196
That's it?

23:46.230 --> 23:48.031
She didn't, like, threaten you or anything?

23:48.065 --> 23:50.066
No, she just acted really disappointed,

23:50.101 --> 23:53.069
which, believe me, is way creepier.

23:53.239 --> 23:57.709
Suffice it to say she's
never gonna trust me again.

23:57.743 --> 24:00.645
Great. Great.

24:00.679 --> 24:03.715
Not to change the subject,

24:03.749 --> 24:05.817
how long has Ethan been staying with you?

24:05.851 --> 24:09.754
Uh! What, did you see his bike outside?

24:09.788 --> 24:11.623
No, I saw him through the window.

24:11.657 --> 24:14.359
Gotta say,

24:14.393 --> 24:16.694
shirtless-in-the-moonlight
really works for some people.

24:16.729 --> 24:19.297
Dan kicked him out.

24:19.331 --> 24:21.132
It was my fault.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.501
Well, he could have just
come to the cabin with me.

24:23.536 --> 24:27.071
You guys aren't, like...?

24:27.106 --> 24:29.974
I'm with Thayer. You know that.

24:30.009 --> 24:31.042
Okay.

24:31.076 --> 24:33.978
Look, there's something I gotta say...

24:34.013 --> 24:36.981
Please.

24:37.016 --> 24:39.050
We're all ears.

24:41.921 --> 24:43.888
It can wait.

24:45.791 --> 24:48.426
(door closes)

24:51.397 --> 24:52.664
Awkward.

24:57.165 --> 24:59.901
(Bell rings)

25:01.308 --> 25:02.942
Thayer, hi.

25:02.976 --> 25:06.011
Hey, I just came by to
see if Sutton was here.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.148
Actually, she left a few minutes
ago with Laurel and Ethan.

25:09.182 --> 25:12.818
Was she expecting you?

25:12.853 --> 25:14.820
No, I... I guess not.

25:14.855 --> 25:17.823
Uh, it's okay. I'll just call her back.

25:17.858 --> 25:18.958
Thayer, wait!

25:18.992 --> 25:21.627
Yeah?

25:21.661 --> 25:24.763
I know this is none of my business, but...

25:29.369 --> 25:31.403
I know how much you care for Sutton,

25:31.438 --> 25:35.241
and I know how important
you are to her, too.

25:36.476 --> 25:38.944
But?

25:38.979 --> 25:41.080
You're just so young to be so serious.

25:41.114 --> 25:43.149
Maybe this isn't the right time.

25:43.183 --> 25:45.885
Are you telling me to back off?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.754
Did Sutton put you up to this?

25:48.788 --> 25:50.022
No.

25:50.056 --> 25:53.025
Thayer, I just...

25:53.059 --> 25:54.827
What happened?

25:54.861 --> 25:57.029
You had so much going on in your life.

25:57.063 --> 25:58.731
You graduated,

25:58.765 --> 26:00.799
you started a business.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.735
What, what happened in California?

26:02.769 --> 26:06.672
Mrs. Mercer, my whole life

26:06.706 --> 26:08.574
I've watched people give up on each other.

26:10.577 --> 26:16.248
My mom, Alec, you and Dr. Mercer.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.284
So no offense, but I think
I'm gonna stick around.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.487
You tell her I stopped by.

26:25.364 --> 26:26.332
<i>Okay, the question is,</i>

26:26.366 --> 26:28.476
how are we going to prove
that Rebecca was involved

26:28.477 --> 26:30.969
- with Theresa's disappearance?
- Well, we can rule out

26:31.004 --> 26:33.441
asking her politely, that's for sure.

26:33.475 --> 26:35.941
Look, I don't care how we
do it, but we gotta hurry.

26:35.975 --> 26:37.142
If Theresa's still alive out there

26:37.177 --> 26:38.911
we're running out of time.

26:38.945 --> 26:39.878
(door opens)

26:39.913 --> 26:41.947
Hey, you guys. So, I think

26:41.981 --> 26:44.650
I may have brought someone who can help.

26:45.685 --> 26:46.652
Hey.

26:47.754 --> 26:48.687
Seriously?

26:48.722 --> 26:50.723
Well, my dad trusts him,

26:50.757 --> 26:53.525
and so do I.

26:56.496 --> 27:00.265
Emma, Sutton.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.634
So, you know, then, about the twins?

27:02.669 --> 27:05.437
Oh, you would be surprised
at how much he knows.

27:05.472 --> 27:07.072
What does that mean?

27:07.107 --> 27:08.307
Let's just say I have Rebecca's trust,

27:08.341 --> 27:10.275
maybe even more than you do.

27:10.310 --> 27:11.944
Okay, well, believe me,
that's an understatement.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.212
So, last night,

27:13.246 --> 27:16.181
I saw Rebecca in her bedroom
locking this box in a cabinet.

27:16.216 --> 27:17.916
ETHAN: What kind of box?

27:17.951 --> 27:19.051
It's where she used to hide things

27:19.085 --> 27:20.085
she didn't want my dad to see.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.020
Mostly pictures of you guys. So she's got

27:22.055 --> 27:24.823
dinner tonight, and I figure
it might be my chance to see

27:24.858 --> 27:25.924
what's in the box.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.726
Okay, well, that's a good plan.

27:27.761 --> 27:29.728
In the meantime,

27:29.763 --> 27:30.829
I have one of my own.

27:31.931 --> 27:33.599
What is it?

27:33.633 --> 27:34.833
Well, Emma, desperate times

27:34.868 --> 27:36.668
call for desperate measures.

27:41.341 --> 27:43.542
Finishing late, huh?

27:43.576 --> 27:46.178
I admire the work ethic.

27:46.272 --> 27:48.407
What now?

27:48.441 --> 27:50.542
Nothing. I just came by
to see how you're doing.

27:50.577 --> 27:52.211
See if you'd given any thought

27:52.245 --> 27:54.079
to what we talked about the other day.

27:54.113 --> 27:56.348
Oh, yeah, yeah. You mean
your speech about how

27:56.382 --> 27:59.051
you've been this overbearing
jerk to me my whole life,

27:59.085 --> 28:03.822
but somehow it's okay because you love me?

28:03.857 --> 28:05.057
That one?

28:05.091 --> 28:07.926
T, T, come on, man. I
know you're angry with me

28:07.961 --> 28:10.729
and it may be hard to believe,
but even when it looked like

28:10.763 --> 28:12.487
I was trying to run you out of
town, I had a reason, you know?

28:12.533 --> 28:14.800
California. Let me guess,

28:14.834 --> 28:16.034
you think I should've stayed there, right?

28:16.069 --> 28:18.770
No. I'm glad you're here.

28:18.805 --> 28:20.506
Yeah.

28:20.508 --> 28:21.773
You're my son and I love you.

28:21.808 --> 28:23.542
I do wish you'd trust me, though. Yeah.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.444
Yeah, I wish you'd

28:25.478 --> 28:28.280
get it out of your head that
I'm some sort of criminal

28:28.314 --> 28:31.383
'cause I'm not.

28:31.417 --> 28:32.484
What do your friends say?

28:32.519 --> 28:36.421
I... I don't know. They
think Rebecca did it.

28:38.992 --> 28:40.392
So why don't you listen to them?

28:42.426 --> 28:43.228
Son, I know

28:43.263 --> 28:46.832
a huge part of you wants me
to be guilty for some reason,

28:46.866 --> 28:50.936
but the fact is, I'm not.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.972
It's Rebecca that needs
to go down for this,

28:54.007 --> 28:57.943
for everything, not me.

28:57.977 --> 29:01.547
And if you're gonna stick around anyway,

29:01.581 --> 29:04.483
why don't you do us both a favor,

29:04.517 --> 29:08.287
help me get that done?

29:21.434 --> 29:23.435
Sutton, hon.

29:23.469 --> 29:25.037
What's going on?

29:25.071 --> 29:27.906
Hi. Sorry, I know it's late.

29:27.941 --> 29:30.142
I just wanted to meet somewhere
where no one could hear us.

29:30.176 --> 29:32.778
Yeah, of course. I understand.

29:32.812 --> 29:38.717
So I was thinking about
our talk the other night,

29:38.751 --> 29:43.488
and how huge it was hearing you say

29:43.523 --> 29:45.490
that you were my real dad.

29:45.525 --> 29:48.460
Well, you were there.
It was huge for me, too.

29:48.494 --> 29:52.364
So... and I hope this isn't too weird...

29:52.398 --> 29:55.634
but I was wondering if you would be willing

29:55.668 --> 29:58.403
to maybe...

29:58.438 --> 29:59.504
say it again?

29:59.539 --> 30:01.373
Of course, I will say it

30:01.407 --> 30:04.042
as many times as you
want me to say it, hon.

30:05.445 --> 30:07.045
Sutton, I'm your dad.

30:08.047 --> 30:09.915
Oh!

30:11.951 --> 30:13.018
Oh, sweetie.

30:13.052 --> 30:14.252
I'm sorry.

30:14.287 --> 30:17.055
I'm sorry. I know I'm not
usually like this. Honey...

30:17.090 --> 30:22.961
Just, growing up and wondering who...

30:22.996 --> 30:25.697
Sweetie, I only wish I'd told you sooner.

30:25.732 --> 30:28.834
But if this is the only reason
you asked me to come out here,

30:28.868 --> 30:32.504
then I'm glad I came.

30:32.538 --> 30:36.708
There was... one more thing.

30:36.743 --> 30:39.311
Sure. What?

30:49.155 --> 30:52.024
Hi, Dad.

30:54.961 --> 30:56.728
Oh, my God.

30:58.698 --> 31:00.599
My name's Emma.

31:04.149 --> 31:05.282
How is it possible?

31:06.216 --> 31:09.052
Alec split us up.

31:09.086 --> 31:11.154
When he sent me to Phoenix

31:11.188 --> 31:13.056
to be with you guys, he sent Emma

31:13.090 --> 31:16.893
to Beverly Hills to be with another family.

31:16.927 --> 31:19.796
It was a lot less glamorous than it sounds.

31:19.830 --> 31:21.497
All those years,

31:21.532 --> 31:23.800
I thought I was the only
one keeping a secret.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.369
What was Alec thinking? And Rebecca?

31:26.403 --> 31:28.337
She didn't know Alec split us up.

31:28.372 --> 31:31.374
Yeah, but she has known for a while.

31:31.408 --> 31:35.144
She was hoping to keep it
secret just until she finished

31:35.179 --> 31:36.245
splitting you and Mom up.

31:37.281 --> 31:40.083
Okay, yes, and I was on board

31:40.117 --> 31:42.819
with the plan for a while.

31:42.853 --> 31:44.253
Problem is, we think
Rebecca's plan involved

31:44.288 --> 31:48.725
killing Derek and taking Theresa.

31:48.759 --> 31:51.094
Yeah, that's, that's what Alec said.

31:51.128 --> 31:53.663
If he's right, we need
to do something fast.

31:53.697 --> 31:57.600
And I tried to talk to Rebecca
and get something out of her,

31:57.634 --> 31:59.736
but it didn't go anywhere.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.639
Now I think you're the only one she trusts.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.409
Okay.

32:06.443 --> 32:08.578
Then I'll handle it.

32:08.612 --> 32:12.281
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

32:12.316 --> 32:14.016
Twins.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.385
Daddy.

32:23.961 --> 32:25.928
Good night.

32:36.048 --> 32:38.016
Ted?

32:40.653 --> 32:42.521
What's going on, buddy?

32:42.555 --> 32:44.723
What do you think?

32:44.757 --> 32:46.725
I think you look like hell. (chuckles)

32:46.759 --> 32:48.426
Yeah?

32:48.461 --> 32:49.694
Maybe that's because I just had

32:49.729 --> 32:51.663
a conversation with my daughters.

32:51.697 --> 32:53.331
Sutton...

32:53.366 --> 32:54.466
Emma.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.880
And here we are.

33:01.915 --> 33:05.150
Yeah. You separated them?

33:05.184 --> 33:06.852
Who the hell does something like that?

33:06.886 --> 33:08.820
I'm your oldest friend, Ted.

33:08.855 --> 33:10.722
My oldest friend!

33:10.757 --> 33:14.760
Why? Why'd you do it? Do
you really hate me that much?

33:14.794 --> 33:16.662
No. Come on.

33:16.696 --> 33:19.698
You remember what it was like?

33:19.732 --> 33:21.867
The fertility treatments you went through?

33:21.901 --> 33:24.636
The strain that put on your marriage?

33:24.671 --> 33:26.505
Not to mention the
financial crisis you were in.

33:26.539 --> 33:27.739
Which, yes, I got you out of.

33:27.774 --> 33:30.509
You were in no condition to be saddled

33:30.543 --> 33:32.611
with the burden of twins, man, okay?

33:32.645 --> 33:34.212
So you just take one?

33:34.247 --> 33:37.115
Yeah.

33:37.150 --> 33:39.484
You put it like that,
at the time, it did seem,

33:39.519 --> 33:43.055
it seemed like the right thing to do.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.423
Yeah, well, I never needed your help.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.025
Maybe I wasn't doing it for you.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.028
Kristin?

33:50.063 --> 33:52.164
You just stay the hell
away from her, you got it?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.800
Everything that has happened
has made me realize what I have

33:54.834 --> 33:56.034
to do to get my family back.

33:56.069 --> 33:57.836
And until I do that, if
I see you around them,

33:57.870 --> 33:59.004
I may not have killed Derek Rogers,

33:59.038 --> 34:00.806
but I will sure as hell kill you.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.139
(shrieks)

34:38.143 --> 34:39.911
Mads!

34:39.946 --> 34:42.748
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.784
- Did you see their face?
- No.

34:45.818 --> 34:48.120
I just found the box in the file cabinet,

34:48.154 --> 34:49.821
but someone got to it first.

34:49.856 --> 34:51.989
Which means this just got
a lot more complicated.

34:58.898 --> 35:03.402
Hey, what are you still doing here?

35:03.436 --> 35:04.569
Everyone else left,

35:04.604 --> 35:07.673
so I thought I'd stay
a little while longer.

35:11.377 --> 35:14.212
We used to come here all the time...

35:14.247 --> 35:16.114
just the four of us.

35:18.051 --> 35:20.152
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

35:22.422 --> 35:24.189
It was good times, though.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.059
Were they?

35:27.168 --> 35:29.169
I mean, I know that they were

35:29.203 --> 35:32.105
important for me, but...

35:32.140 --> 35:33.807
But what?

35:33.841 --> 35:36.843
I guess ever since you
took off for California

35:36.878 --> 35:39.045
without telling me,

35:39.080 --> 35:42.849
leaving a complete stranger in your place,

35:42.884 --> 35:48.488
I just want, I just want to ask:

35:48.523 --> 35:52.692
did you ever give a crap
about being my sister?

35:54.796 --> 35:56.463
About our family?

35:56.497 --> 35:59.533
Of course I did. What
kind of question is that?

35:59.567 --> 36:01.401
A pretty good one, I think.

36:01.435 --> 36:05.138
You had everything:

36:05.173 --> 36:06.339
two parents who loved you,

36:06.374 --> 36:08.975
a little sister who wanted to be like you,

36:09.010 --> 36:10.310
and still, you sided with Rebecca.

36:10.344 --> 36:13.346
You tried to destroy your own family.

36:13.381 --> 36:14.948
Why would you do that?

36:14.982 --> 36:17.818
Because I made a mistake, okay?

36:19.821 --> 36:23.890
I trusted Rebecca, and I did some
things that I am not proud of.

36:23.985 --> 36:27.754
But I told myself that
it was okay because she,

36:27.788 --> 36:30.657
she's my birth mother,

36:30.691 --> 36:32.826
and we, we shared flesh and blood.

36:32.940 --> 36:36.876
You mean kind of like you and me?

36:39.613 --> 36:43.450
Yeah. Yeah.

36:43.484 --> 36:48.621
I've lived with you for 16 years,

36:48.656 --> 36:54.361
and I've never needed shared
DNA as a reason to love you.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.134
(sighs) Oh, God.

37:01.168 --> 37:08.842
Laurel, I'm, I'm sorry for
the way I've treated you...

37:08.876 --> 37:11.911
these last few years.

37:11.946 --> 37:13.179
I'm, I'm sorry.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.587
(phone ringing)

37:20.621 --> 37:21.721
Oh, my God.

37:21.756 --> 37:24.691
What? Who is it?

37:24.725 --> 37:26.726
It's Theresa.

37:26.761 --> 37:29.429
Theresa? Hello?

37:29.463 --> 37:30.563
(woman panting)

37:30.598 --> 37:32.699
Hello?

37:38.931 --> 37:41.121
So, you got a call but there
was no one on the other end?

37:41.364 --> 37:44.266
No. I heard someone breathing.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.269
Dan's still not picking up.
I left him another message.

37:47.303 --> 37:48.537
LAUREL: So you can find her, right?

37:48.571 --> 37:50.239
Hopefully.

37:50.273 --> 37:52.408
Most phones have GPS, like Theresa's.

37:52.442 --> 37:55.077
There you are. I was
calling you for an hour.

37:55.111 --> 37:57.112
Where is she?

37:57.147 --> 38:00.249
HARRY: It's tracking right now.

38:00.283 --> 38:02.084
That can't be right.

38:06.055 --> 38:10.092
REBECCA: You know, I was worried about you.

38:10.126 --> 38:13.996
I came by earlier to see how you were.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.631
Hmm?

38:15.665 --> 38:18.834
I was probably on the driving range.

38:18.868 --> 38:23.505
So what was it you wanted to tell me?

38:24.707 --> 38:27.609
I don't really know how to
bring this up except just...

38:27.644 --> 38:29.511
to bring it up.

38:29.546 --> 38:33.482
Well, it's like I said before,
you can trust me with anything.

38:35.351 --> 38:38.320
I know that Sutton is ours.

38:40.323 --> 38:42.558
Oh.

38:44.627 --> 38:46.261
Oh, wow.

38:49.165 --> 38:50.432
She told you?

38:50.467 --> 38:52.267
Yeah.

38:52.302 --> 38:54.369
I was afraid of that.

38:54.404 --> 38:56.338
It's okay.

38:56.372 --> 38:58.373
No, it...

38:58.408 --> 39:01.109
I really wanted to tell you myself.

39:01.144 --> 39:03.078
I was just waiting for the right time.

39:03.112 --> 39:04.980
And...

39:05.014 --> 39:06.949
What else did she tell you?

39:06.983 --> 39:09.818
What else could there be?

39:09.853 --> 39:12.020
(chuckles)

39:12.055 --> 39:13.889
Hey.

39:13.923 --> 39:15.891
Alec, it's late.

39:15.925 --> 39:17.826
I know. This is just
gonna take a second, okay?

39:18.995 --> 39:21.763
I want to apologize for what
happened at the club today.

39:21.798 --> 39:24.533
I don't want to discuss it.

39:24.567 --> 39:30.405
When I told Rebecca that that kiss
between us meant nothing, I was...

39:30.440 --> 39:31.473
Come on.

39:32.575 --> 39:35.377
I lied. I didn't mean to...

39:35.411 --> 39:37.546
What, humiliate me in
front of all those people?

39:37.580 --> 39:38.547
No.

39:38.581 --> 39:40.282
Well, I'm glad it happened.

39:40.316 --> 39:41.650
I reminded me that you're still married.

39:41.684 --> 39:44.520
Just for a little bit longer.

39:44.554 --> 39:47.556
I've got some information
that's gonna put Rebecca away

39:47.590 --> 39:49.291
for a really long time.

39:51.160 --> 39:55.130
Then we can finally be together.

39:56.199 --> 39:58.400
What makes you think that's what I want?

39:59.469 --> 40:01.403
I kissed you.

40:03.339 --> 40:05.841
Good night.

40:09.812 --> 40:13.048
Alec split them up. As
soon as they were born,

40:13.082 --> 40:14.950
he sent Sutton to you

40:14.984 --> 40:17.719
and our other daughter to another family.

40:17.754 --> 40:19.988
I just found all this out recently.

40:20.023 --> 40:23.058
And she's here.

40:23.092 --> 40:27.729
She's here, too, Ted, in Phoenix.

40:27.764 --> 40:29.765
I came here for the three of you.

40:29.799 --> 40:34.570
So you would do anything
to protect me, wouldn't you?

40:34.604 --> 40:35.938
Anything.

40:39.642 --> 40:41.910
And that is why...

40:41.945 --> 40:46.582
you killed Derek and Theresa.

40:46.616 --> 40:48.684
(sirens approach)

40:48.718 --> 40:50.819
(siren blips)

40:53.623 --> 40:56.458
I just want to know where I stand.

40:59.762 --> 41:04.366
What if don't know how to answer that?

41:06.402 --> 41:10.172
Emma, there's only one way to answer that:

41:10.206 --> 41:11.440
the truth.

41:14.344 --> 41:16.244
(sirens approach)

41:17.413 --> 41:19.147
(sirens stop)

41:19.182 --> 41:20.282
What's going on?

41:21.417 --> 41:23.352
(siren blipping)

41:24.654 --> 41:26.455
I need everybody to spread out.

41:26.489 --> 41:28.190
We've located the cell phone.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.225
It was in a planter by the back entrance.

41:30.259 --> 41:32.628
All right, great, you found the cell phone.

41:32.662 --> 41:34.262
Where is she?

41:46.242 --> 41:48.510
- Hey.
- I'll leave you two alone.

41:49.679 --> 41:51.480
I got a call from Theresa's cell phone.

41:51.514 --> 41:53.181
The cops traced it back here.

41:53.216 --> 41:55.651
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

41:55.685 --> 41:58.253
One of us needs to be here for Ethan.

41:58.287 --> 42:00.656
It's okay. I saw you two in the kitchen.

42:00.690 --> 42:03.191
I think we both know who it should be.

42:03.226 --> 42:04.326
You sure?

42:04.360 --> 42:06.261
If I wasn't, I wouldn't have offered.

42:06.295 --> 42:08.263
Turn around. You know the drill.

42:08.297 --> 42:09.431
Ted, I never meant...

42:09.465 --> 42:11.266
Not now.

42:16.406 --> 42:19.307
MAN: Dan, we need you over here!

42:23.413 --> 42:26.281
Can we get some lights on out here?

42:26.315 --> 42:28.383
What is it?

42:37.458 --> 42:39.656
DAN: Theresa!
