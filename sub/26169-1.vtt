00:43.500 --> 00:44.333
I'll do anything.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.461
Please, don't.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.379
I'll change.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.756
I can change.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.718
I promise, please don't.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.222
We're out champagne.

01:40.224 --> 01:41.891
Oh, no champagne?

01:41.893 --> 01:43.267
What's a poor girl to do?

01:43.269 --> 01:45.770
Get her brilliant,
sexy, amazing husband

01:45.772 --> 01:48.314
to get it from the store?

01:48.316 --> 01:50.317
Ah, the labor of love.

01:53.987 --> 01:55.197
I'll see you in a bit.

02:51.587 --> 02:52.919
Hey, how are you, love?

02:52.921 --> 02:55.256
What's up, superstar?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.631
Working maid, I see.

02:56.633 --> 02:57.674
Yup.

02:57.676 --> 02:59.802
What is this insanity?

02:59.804 --> 03:01.179
There's some
crazy people out there, huh?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.012
Right.

03:02.014 --> 03:03.263
Truer words, my friend.

03:03.265 --> 03:21.450
Truer words.

05:07.514 --> 05:08.349
Fuck.

05:15.439 --> 05:17.649
What the fuck is going on?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.490
Hello?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.451
Fuck, come on.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.260
The fuck are you?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.055
I'm Bailey the Clown.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.107
Oh, don't be shy, Billy.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.483
What?

06:36.478 --> 06:47.240
What?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.656
Here.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.074
Hold this.

07:02.172 --> 07:08.720
Well, that wasn't very nice.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.635
Get away from me.

07:09.637 --> 07:14.641
Billy, have you been smoking?

07:15.935 --> 07:16.769
Have you?

07:24.819 --> 07:27.570
Smoking can kill you and lead

07:27.572 --> 07:29.988
to forest fires if
you're not careful.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.742
What's that bear's name?

07:32.744 --> 07:33.578
Ah, Yogi.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.372
Yeah, yeah?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.373
It's not it.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.873
Well, never mind.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.377
I'll think of it.

07:42.836 --> 07:48.634
Time for a fun fact.

07:48.634 --> 07:52.639
Whoo, what?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.430
I fucking hate that one!

07:54.432 --> 07:55.266
I hate it!

07:56.850 --> 07:57.685
Fuck!

08:01.105 --> 08:02.356
Ah, here we go.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.317
Dolphins are unable to smell.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.610
Did you know that?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.902
No!

08:08.904 --> 08:10.279
Well, they can't.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.031
And there's a football
team named after them.

08:13.033 --> 08:16.536
You know I'd like to have a
football team named after me?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.161
What, are you a fan?

08:18.163 --> 08:19.663
Did I not sign an
autograph or something?

08:19.665 --> 08:20.750
What is this?

08:22.584 --> 08:27.089
You mean you
don't recognize me?

08:27.089 --> 08:27.923
No!

08:29.384 --> 08:31.175
Are you sure?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.011
Yes!

08:33.846 --> 08:36.472
Well, I'm Bailey the Clown!

08:36.474 --> 08:39.057
Yes, you've said that.

08:39.058 --> 08:41.854
Everybody knows
Bailey the Clown.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.068
Don't fucking touch me!

08:53.658 --> 08:58.079
There will be no cursing
at this party, young man.

09:03.460 --> 09:11.426
Time for another fun fact.

09:11.426 --> 09:16.431
Ah, did you know that beavers
were once the size of bears?

09:17.264 --> 09:19.348
I mean, that's a big beaver.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.787
Kelly Owen, calling for you.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.662
Should I tell her
you're all tied up?

09:42.664 --> 09:43.830
Ha!

09:43.832 --> 09:44.833
All tied up.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.084
Absurd.

09:49.547 --> 09:54.717
Kelly Owen, 5038 Coral Canyon.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.134
Well, that's not far from here.

09:56.136 --> 09:57.762
That's right up the PCH.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.891
If you so much as look
at her, I will fucking kill you!

10:01.893 --> 10:02.809
Do you hear me?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.229
I will kill you!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.448
Fuck.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.952
Language, Billy.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.911
Watch your language.

10:22.913 --> 10:27.335
You don't want me to have
to get out my bar of soap.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.752
Why are you calling me Billy?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.464
My name is not Billy.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.885
And on with the show!

10:46.937 --> 10:49.147
Why are you doing this?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.440
What do you want from me?

10:50.442 --> 10:53.445
Can I be honest with you?

10:54.111 --> 10:55.279
Yes, please.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.874
Sometimes, what you
see on the outside

11:08.876 --> 11:11.045
is not what's on the inside.

11:12.629 --> 11:13.754
Take me for example.

11:13.756 --> 11:20.889
I smile all the time.

11:20.889 --> 11:29.938
But on the inside,
I'm a very lost soul.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.903
Well, I gotta go.

11:38.405 --> 11:41.699
But please, like, follow
me on social media.

11:41.701 --> 11:46.373
I am Bailey the Clown.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.847
Ah, Smokey!

12:03.847 --> 12:06.140
I knew I'll think of it!

12:19.072 --> 12:19.905
Hello!

12:21.783 --> 12:22.616
Hello!

12:51.645 --> 12:52.978
Police, open up!

12:52.980 --> 12:53.979
Help, I'm here!

12:53.981 --> 12:55.022
I'm here!

12:55.024 --> 12:57.190
I'm in the basement!

12:57.192 --> 12:58.151
Oh, thank god.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.027
He's upstairs, he's upstairs.

13:00.029 --> 13:00.862
Freeze!

13:00.864 --> 13:02.070
Do not move!

13:02.072 --> 13:02.905
Show me your hands!

13:02.907 --> 13:04.114
I can't move my hands.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.451
I'm restrained.

13:07.202 --> 13:08.118
Please, he's upstairs.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.537
He's wearing a clown costume.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.916
My name is Craig Owen, please.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.134
Oh fuck.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.597
Okay, okay, I'm
not going anywhere.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.601
Turn it off.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.892
Turn it off, now!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.185
Turn what off?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.728
The blowtorch, goddammit!

13:34.730 --> 13:35.731
Turn it off!

13:38.234 --> 13:41.528
God, how could you?

13:41.528 --> 13:43.028
Look, man.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.113
You've got the wrong guy.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.782
My name is Craig Owen.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.242
I'm a musician.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.494
No, we got you now.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.706
I guess seven wasn't your
lucky number, was it?

13:54.708 --> 13:55.542
Detective!

13:56.503 --> 13:58.672
He's down here, I got him!

14:01.048 --> 14:03.382
You have the right
to remain silent.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.219
Anything you say could be used
against you in court of law.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.805
You have the right
to get an attorney

14:08.807 --> 14:13.100
and if you can't afford one,
the court will appoint you one.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.518
Please, please.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.228
I haven't done anything.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.939
What did you say?

14:17.941 --> 14:20.108
I haven't done...

14:20.110 --> 14:23.361
Give me a reason,
you low life scum.

14:38.961 --> 14:43.383
There's a special place in
hell for people like you.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.101
Oh god.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.855
Fuck, this is totally insane.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.649
Fuck, what's going on?

15:08.115 --> 15:09.781
Fuck, I cannot.

15:09.783 --> 15:10.951
Can you, please?

15:13.120 --> 15:13.954
Kelly!

15:15.539 --> 15:16.748
Baby, please, help me.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.123
Baby, please.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.541
Hey baby, it's me.

15:19.543 --> 15:20.792
I'm just worried about you.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.046
Give me a call, okay?

15:23.048 --> 15:23.881
Bye.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.436
How you doing, Bill?

16:20.062 --> 16:24.274
Huh?

16:52.678 --> 16:55.387
Don't make this difficult.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.100
We know you did it.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.488
Kelly Owen.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.241
Sister, you must be
one sick twisted bitch

17:16.242 --> 17:18.786
hanging around with
the likes of this guy.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.871
Touch her...

17:19.873 --> 17:21.622
And then what?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.544
Hm, what the fuck
are you gonna do?

17:32.801 --> 17:37.220
Hey, you wanna tell me where
you were last night, Billy boy?

17:37.222 --> 17:39.725
My name is not Billy.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.025
Where the fuck were you?

17:48.359 --> 17:49.441
At the store.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.110
I was on my way...

17:51.112 --> 17:54.238
You paid Allison Perry a
little visit, didn't you?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.198
No, I don't know...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.158
Shut the fuck up!

17:57.160 --> 17:59.160
There's seven people dead.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.830
Seven.

18:01.830 --> 18:06.211
And we found Allison Perry
decapitated in Silver Lake.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.716
But you knew that, all right.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.094
Look, motherfucker!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.556
Untie me right now!

18:20.307 --> 18:21.142
Right now!

18:29.401 --> 18:30.402
Right now!

18:44.582 --> 18:47.585
Listen, please just untie me.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.837
All right, I'll walk away.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.424
This never happened.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.176
Never.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.221
Never happened.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.681
Well, why didn't you say so?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.019
Never happened.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.479
The only thing is.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.233
It did happen!

19:12.317 --> 19:16.403
Now, I want you tell me that
you killed those seven people.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.532
I want you to tell me
where those six bodies are.

19:19.534 --> 19:20.365
I don't know.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.366
I don't know.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.285
Tell me!

19:22.287 --> 19:24.456
I don't know, I don't know.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.423
I wonder.

19:33.423 --> 19:37.674
How difficult would it
be to knock out a tooth?

19:37.676 --> 19:38.801
Shut the fuck up.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.719
I'm trying to concentrate.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.095
You don't want this gun
to accidentally go off

19:42.097 --> 19:45.894
in your mouth now, do you?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.392
No!

19:47.394 --> 19:48.229
No, no no.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.738
Huh, not that
difficult, really.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.030
Surprising.

20:00.032 --> 20:00.948
And you know, I
would think enamel

20:00.950 --> 20:03.536
would be a lot harder than that.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.457
But then again,
I'm not a dentist.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.919
Look at that.

20:12.921 --> 20:13.922
Two for one.

20:15.423 --> 20:19.301
Today must be my lucky day.

20:19.301 --> 20:24.098
Oh.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.305
See, the problem is
you spit those out

20:25.307 --> 20:27.892
on my clean fucking floor.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.939
Chew 'em.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.440
What?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.528
Chew the fucking teeth.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.909
Swallow them.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.326
What?

20:46.328 --> 20:54.295
Do it or I'll knock the rest
of your goddamn teeth out.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.878
Open up.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.756
Let me see.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.634
Good boy.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.103
Did anything seem weird?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.523
No.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.399
Was he talking with anyone?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.401
No, not that I saw.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.318
But, you know, we've
been pretty busy.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.947
So nothing out
of the ordinary?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.076
No, just paid and left.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.332
Wait, Lauren, do you guys
have security cameras outside?

21:32.334 --> 21:33.710
No, just inside.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.047
Okay, thanks.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.215
Money is no object.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.258
How much do you want?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.053
How much do you want?

21:45.055 --> 21:47.596
You're not gonna be able to
buy your way outta this one.

21:47.598 --> 21:51.601
A clown who cuts people's
head's off with a blowtorch.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.938
Jesus, just when I saw it all.

21:55.190 --> 21:58.902
So, how's this old thing
gonna play out, Bill?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.240
You're Bill.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.701
Oh, god.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.203
You're Bill.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.332
Oh, fuck.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.546
You know, you confess
to the killings.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.297
You tell us where these
other six bodies are,

22:22.299 --> 22:24.801
make the DA takes
it easy on you.

22:24.803 --> 22:28.554
Gives you life
instead of the needle.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.475
Huh, what do you think?

22:35.855 --> 22:36.940
Okay, okay.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.987
They're in a storage
unit in Van Nuys.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.405
You expect me to believe that?

22:46.407 --> 22:47.991
It's true.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.869
Okay, tough guy,
what's the address.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.455
No, if you want to know
where the bodies are,

22:54.457 --> 22:57.168
I'll take you there or no deal.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.921
You drive a hard bargain.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.852
Oh, fuck!

23:13.852 --> 23:15.267
You bastard.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.855
You fucking bastard.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.988
So what was that address?

23:30.242 --> 23:33.245
819, 819 Park Avenue.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.705
Park Avenue?

23:35.707 --> 23:37.748
Van Nuys is a shit hole.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.252
There's no parks in Van Nuys.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.546
You wanna tell me
those bodies are?

23:44.548 --> 23:45.631
Because I would really hate

23:45.633 --> 23:48.678
to have to pay your
wife a little visit.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.193
Whoa!

24:06.195 --> 24:07.696
That was loud, huh.

24:13.869 --> 24:14.870
Last chance.

24:21.294 --> 24:22.128
See you.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.465
No.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.591
No, please.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.718
Please, she has
nothing to do with it!

24:30.720 --> 24:33.720
She has nothing to do with it!

24:33.722 --> 24:37.307
It's been about
three hours now.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.686
He went to the store
but he never came home

24:39.688 --> 24:43.233
and his car is still
parked at the store.

24:45.777 --> 24:46.611
24 hours?

24:47.778 --> 24:50.613
24 hours, are you kidding me?

24:50.615 --> 24:58.623
Something has happened
to my husband.

24:58.623 --> 24:59.998
You're sorry?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.289
You're sorry?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.792
You're worthless,
that's what you are.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.879
You're fucking worthless.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.115
What the fuck
did you do to her?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.826
I swear to god I'm
gonna fuck you so badly,

25:37.828 --> 25:40.078
all you did is nothing.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.538
This is nothing!

25:41.540 --> 25:42.373
Oh, you're close.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.540
Fucking!

25:43.542 --> 25:46.670
Look how close you're
getting, brother.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.133
Well, you motherfucker,
did that to me, huh?

25:53.135 --> 25:54.719
You fucking do that to me?

25:54.721 --> 25:56.636
I'll fuck your goddamn head off.

25:56.638 --> 26:00.809
You're my bitch
now, you hear me?

26:00.809 --> 26:04.772
You're my bitch now.

26:04.772 --> 26:08.690
You know how long I've
been waiting for this day?

26:08.692 --> 26:12.778
Guard told me you
were coming last week.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.697
Welcome to San Quentin!

26:14.699 --> 26:16.282
Fuck off.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.076
I'm gonna run down
the basics for you.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.245
You're ready to spend
22 hours a day in a cell

26:21.247 --> 26:23.038
the size of a bathroom.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.623
No privacy.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.875
And don't worry about
bending over in the shower

26:26.877 --> 26:29.545
'cause you're gonna be
fucked sooner or later.

26:29.547 --> 26:30.796
And you're responsible

26:30.798 --> 26:32.340
for buying your own
toothbrush, toothpaste.

26:32.342 --> 26:35.093
The state does supply you with
a little green bar of soap.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.594
It's kinda itchy but
you'll get used to it.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.263
All right, don't trust anybody.

26:39.265 --> 26:43.642
Your best friend today might
be your worst enemy tomorrow.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.438
Hell, you could pretty
much get anything you want.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.942
Drugs, cigarettes, decent food.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.405
Just gotta pay for it.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.824
Paid a pretty penny
for these babies.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.202
What do you think?

27:03.832 --> 27:07.376
Pretty neat.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.627
Hey, come here.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.798
What are you doing?

27:14.800 --> 27:17.218
Listen, if you untie me,

27:17.220 --> 27:18.428
I can get us outta here.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.720
Oh, yeah?

27:19.722 --> 27:21.805
I know a guy on the inside.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.182
When we're out, I can get
you anything you need.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.521
Anything you want.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.734
But man, what's your name?

27:32.736 --> 27:33.776
You don't know me,

27:33.778 --> 27:35.821
but I know you?

27:35.821 --> 27:38.655
And you knew my sister?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.782
No.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.116
Mary Beth?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.910
No, I don't know
any Mary Beth.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.913
Today is her birthday.

27:46.875 --> 27:53.298
I remember in her
seventh birthday,

27:53.298 --> 27:57.382
we lived in this little
apartment in Bakersfield

27:57.384 --> 27:59.052
and my mom's boyfriend came over

27:59.054 --> 28:03.975
and they gotten into a fight
and he knocked her out cold.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.894
But we ran in the bedroom
and Mary Beth and I

28:08.896 --> 28:15.069
and we locked the door and
she was crying her eyes out.

28:15.069 --> 28:19.738
And he kicked in the door
and I attacked him, right?

28:19.740 --> 28:20.864
But I'm seven, man!

28:20.866 --> 28:22.743
I'm seven, what can I do?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.498
So he shoved me against the wall

28:28.500 --> 28:34.172
and he tied up my hands and
feet with a telephone cord.

28:34.172 --> 28:37.882
And I remember Mary Beth
had on the rainbow underwear

28:37.884 --> 28:40.220
that she got for Christmas.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.932
And he had his hand
around her little neck

28:46.934 --> 28:49.393
while he violated her.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.605
I screamed and I screamed.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.238
When he was done, he
pulled up his pants

29:00.240 --> 29:01.740
and he came over to me.

29:03.535 --> 29:06.661
Carved this cross into
my arm with a Buck knife

29:06.663 --> 29:09.831
and he said Jesus
Christ died for your sin

29:09.833 --> 29:11.915
and then he walked away.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.834
A little while later,
I got it tattooed,

29:13.836 --> 29:16.336
I guess as a reminder.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.799
I ran into him a few years ago.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.802
He's no longer with us.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.805
Mary Beth, she was not
not really the same, man.

29:25.807 --> 29:30.060
She got fucked up
with drugs and shit

29:30.060 --> 29:31.936
but she would
visit me every week

29:31.938 --> 29:33.563
and bring me fresh
baked cookies.

29:33.565 --> 29:36.567
It was my favorite
part of the week.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.114
That was until a month ago.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.036
When they found her.

29:47.369 --> 29:51.249
She's in a better place now.

29:51.249 --> 29:58.256
She's my angel and I would
do anything for my sister.

30:03.970 --> 30:08.016
Listen.

30:08.016 --> 30:10.892
While I can't pretend to know

30:10.894 --> 30:13.855
what you and your
sister went through,

30:15.147 --> 30:17.483
my wife was in foster care.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.153
It was awful.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.488
She was with one of the families

30:23.490 --> 30:26.659
that just keeps the
kids for the money.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.161
They'd lock her in a closet.

30:30.163 --> 30:33.373
When they went out at
night and when they came back,

30:33.375 --> 30:36.500
my wife would pass out drunk.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.047
And her father would molest her.

30:40.548 --> 30:43.591
She still has nightmares
about hearing the sound of him

30:43.593 --> 30:47.135
unbuckling his belt as he
walked towards her door.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.638
Fucking liar!

30:48.640 --> 30:49.680
Don't you fucking lie!

30:49.682 --> 30:51.099
Don't fucking lie!

30:51.101 --> 30:52.057
No, really.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.101
You're fucking lying!

30:53.103 --> 30:54.518
Really, I'm not!

30:54.520 --> 30:56.019
Take it back right now.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.021
Okay, okay, I take it back.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.316
I take it back.

31:06.740 --> 31:07.739
What are you doing?

31:07.741 --> 31:08.576
No, no.

31:09.536 --> 31:10.492
No

31:10.494 --> 31:11.326
Yes.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.327
No, please!

31:12.329 --> 31:13.412
Please, no.

31:13.414 --> 31:14.330
Not my left hand.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.581
Please, not my left hand.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.083
Not my left hand!

31:21.006 --> 31:21.840
Oh, fuck!

31:23.383 --> 31:25.591
Now, why'd you do it?

31:25.593 --> 31:26.926
Why'd you do it?

31:26.928 --> 31:28.219
Please, I don't
know what to say.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.388
I don't know what to say.

31:34.769 --> 31:37.855
No, you cunt!

31:37.855 --> 31:40.398
- You fucking cunt!
- This one.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.109
This one's just for luck.

31:48.657 --> 31:49.489
Fuck, man!

31:49.491 --> 31:50.324
Look what you did.

31:50.326 --> 31:51.409
The guards are coming.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.951
Ah, fuck! You know what?

31:52.953 --> 31:54.120
I'm not done with you yet.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.287
Okay, I'm not finished.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.998
I'm gonna see you.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.292
I'm gonna see you again.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.128
Fucker.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.604
I didn't know
who else to call.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.023
Kelly, we're best friends.

32:22.025 --> 32:24.191
Who else would you call?

32:24.193 --> 32:26.068
Thanks.

32:26.070 --> 32:29.029
So, were you guys
fighting or something?

32:29.031 --> 32:33.284
No, as a matter of fact,
we just had great sex.

32:33.286 --> 32:34.120
Oh.

32:36.498 --> 32:39.707
He always answers his phone.

32:39.709 --> 32:44.336
Maybe his phone died
and he ran into a friend.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.548
He'd find a way to call.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.565
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

33:03.148 --> 33:03.982
Oh, lord.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.442
Barbarians, I see.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.237
Oh, god.

33:09.239 --> 33:11.072
Who did this to you?

33:11.074 --> 33:13.282
Now, there it is.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.161
That's okay, I'm sorry.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.038
Bill?

33:18.038 --> 33:20.248
Do you have any allergies?

33:20.250 --> 33:21.248
Your vitals look good.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.375
Everything seems
to check out there.

33:23.377 --> 33:26.045
Okay, now, look, Bill, I'm
here to help you, okay?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.296
So I'm gonna need you to stay
calm so I can sew up the wound

33:28.298 --> 33:34.806
and stop the and
stop the bleeding.

33:34.806 --> 33:40.561
Oh, there it is.

33:40.561 --> 33:41.395
Oh, lord.

33:44.732 --> 33:46.732
Now, normally, I'll be
able to sew this back on

33:46.734 --> 33:50.612
but do you see the gray
around the edges there?

33:51.448 --> 33:57.537
Basically, that means it's dead.

33:57.537 --> 34:00.037
There's no gray.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.582
Doc, there's no gray.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.209
Doc, there's no gray,
you can sew them back on.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.460
Please, you can
sew them back on.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.378
Please, you can...

34:07.380 --> 34:08.670
This is gonna hurt a bit.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.505
It will hurt.

34:09.507 --> 34:10.630
We slide it out.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.634
There it is.

34:16.347 --> 34:18.097
Please, that's
my wedding ring.

34:18.099 --> 34:21.141
Now, for future reference,
any severed limbs,

34:21.143 --> 34:23.018
you gonna wanna stick
them in a glass of milk

34:23.021 --> 34:25.023
or bag of ice.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.315
Okay, that keeps it fresh
and increase the chances

34:27.317 --> 34:30.318
that they can be sewed on later.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.650
You know, most of the
times after surgery,

34:31.652 --> 34:32.652
they work pretty well.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.237
I don't know if you remember.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.822
A few years back,
there's a fellow

34:35.824 --> 34:37.492
who got his penis cut off,

34:37.494 --> 34:42.204
well, he stuck it in a glass
milk, they sewed it back on,

34:42.206 --> 34:45.042
I heard he shot a porno with it.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.130
There we go.

34:52.132 --> 34:56.260
Oh, I know, I know, it's
gonna sting like crazy.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.347
Stop, stop.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.809
It will keep it
from getting infected.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.066
There we go.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.444
Everything is set.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.322
Don't, please.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.907
Please, I have to
go to the hospital.

35:17.909 --> 35:19.032
The hospital.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.409
Please.

35:20.411 --> 35:21.661
Now, you don't need to
go to the hospital, silly.

35:21.663 --> 35:22.954
No, you can't do this.

35:22.956 --> 35:25.331
Please, I have to
go to the hospital.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.041
Please, I have to
go to the hospital.

35:27.043 --> 35:31.128
It is funny that
you mention hospital though.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.588
When I was a kid,
we would always go

35:33.590 --> 35:37.510
straight to the emergency
room for everything.

35:37.512 --> 35:40.054
And I remember this one time
in the emergency room,

35:40.056 --> 35:41.639
there's a gentleman who
came in who lost his foot

35:41.641 --> 35:43.057
in a lawnmower accident.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.766
Now, apparently, he was
mowing down the hill,

35:44.768 --> 35:47.353
wet grass, slipped, his
foot went right on mower,

35:47.355 --> 35:49.271
cut it clean off.

35:49.273 --> 35:52.150
When they came in, they
had wrapped his stub

35:52.152 --> 35:54.860
in a green towel and
they duct taped it all up

35:54.862 --> 35:56.903
to hold it on there.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.322
You know, there's
a lesson there.

35:59.324 --> 36:10.961
You always gotta be careful
when you're cutting the grass.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.838
You know, come to think of it,

36:13.840 --> 36:16.718
that's the last
time I saw my mama.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.345
I was 12.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.470
And while we were waiting,
she snuck in the back

36:21.472 --> 36:24.474
and tried to steal
some painkillers.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.436
They arrested her
and me and my sister

36:28.438 --> 36:30.521
ended up in foster home.

36:30.523 --> 36:33.648
We eventually got adopted out
to two different families.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.444
Split up.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.740
Well, you know, whatever.

36:40.742 --> 36:43.745
You cannot let your
past define you.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.246
Please, Doc.

36:47.248 --> 36:48.416
You took it out.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.209
You took it out to help people.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.420
I know right now it seems
bad but in six months,

36:54.422 --> 36:58.592
you're not even gonna miss
these little old fingers.

36:59.594 --> 37:02.345
I'm a fucking guitar player.

37:02.347 --> 37:04.557
Well, that is a setback.

37:06.434 --> 37:08.266
But here's the fun fact for you.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.976
Did you know Jerry Garcia?

37:09.978 --> 37:11.354
Do you know who he is?

37:11.356 --> 37:13.731
The fellow they name
that ice cream after.

37:13.733 --> 37:18.443
Well, he was missing
2/3 of his middle finger

37:18.445 --> 37:21.655
and just look at all
the things he did.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.740
All right, we're
just about there.

37:26.329 --> 37:29.454
One more good one ought to do.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.085
That's good, that's real good.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.300
Just cut this.

37:40.135 --> 37:41.136
Good as new.

37:44.514 --> 37:49.269
All right now, I'm gonna leave
work with the prison nurses.

37:50.353 --> 37:51.769
Have them change that on a daily

37:51.771 --> 37:54.479
but I'm gonna need you to
keep it clean, Bill, okay?

37:54.481 --> 37:59.153
Try to keep the heart above
the heart as much as you can.

38:06.036 --> 38:06.911
Fuck you!

38:09.664 --> 38:11.958
It's natural to lash out.

38:13.501 --> 38:14.333
That'll be it.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.128
There we go.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.133
This is my card.

38:22.135 --> 38:25.219
Now, when you get out,
I want you to call me

38:25.221 --> 38:27.512
and I'm gonna take you to lunch.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.309
Get you started
on the right foot.

38:32.061 --> 38:33.603
All right, Bill.

38:33.605 --> 38:36.856
I have to go to the hospital.

38:36.858 --> 38:38.691
I have to go.

38:38.693 --> 38:40.275
I have to go.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.653
Bill, remember, keep
that hand above the heart

38:42.655 --> 38:45.407
as much as you can.

38:45.407 --> 38:49.036
All right.

38:55.126 --> 38:55.960
Fuck.

39:04.094 --> 39:07.512
You don't think
he relapsed, do you?

39:07.514 --> 39:08.347
No.

39:11.601 --> 39:12.434
What?

39:14.521 --> 39:16.979
He's cheating on me.

39:16.981 --> 39:18.563
Are you sure?

39:18.565 --> 39:19.858
Yeah.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.528
Well, how do you know?

39:23.530 --> 39:24.572
A girl knows.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.076
Do you know with who?

39:30.286 --> 39:32.664
No, but maybe he's with her.

39:34.541 --> 39:39.336
I'm sure he's
not, I mean I'm...

39:39.336 --> 39:41.545
God, I can't believe
he's cheating on you.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.756
What the fuck?

39:54.893 --> 39:55.726
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:55.728 --> 39:56.561
Yeah, yeah.

39:56.563 --> 39:57.394
I hear you.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.771
I hear you.

39:58.773 --> 40:00.106
But the thing is it's
a feria, you know.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.316
And it's a small scratch.

40:02.318 --> 40:04.610
It's really not that big a
deal and I don't see why

40:04.612 --> 40:06.653
it's taking so long.

40:06.655 --> 40:09.032
Right, I know but I
need it by the weekend

40:09.034 --> 40:11.534
because we're going to the
summer house next week.

40:11.536 --> 40:12.492
I'm with him.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.787
Right, okay, okay.

40:14.789 --> 40:16.708
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.168
Look, I gotta go.

40:20.170 --> 40:21.001
All right then.

40:21.003 --> 40:21.836
I'll talk to you later.

40:21.838 --> 40:23.378
Bye.

40:23.380 --> 40:24.214
Sorry.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.679
How are you holding up, Bill?

40:30.679 --> 40:32.304
I'm never better.

40:32.306 --> 40:35.516
Listen, I've been at the
governor's office all afternoon.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.267
There are people
outside picking it.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.269
Okay, they're calling your name.

40:38.271 --> 40:40.313
They're chanting Bill,
Bill, Bill!

40:40.315 --> 40:43.318
It's fucking beautiful.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.278
But here's the bad news.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.612
I've done everything I can do.

40:48.614 --> 40:52.867
I've filed every motion,
gone down every legal avenue.

40:52.869 --> 40:54.577
You know, it's the governor.

40:54.579 --> 40:55.994
She's not gonna sign
a stay of execution

40:55.996 --> 40:58.248
in a goddamn election year.

41:02.336 --> 41:03.753
So I guess you don't
need me to tell me this

41:03.755 --> 41:06.925
but that doesn't give
you a lot of time.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.887
We're scheduled for 6:00 a.m.

41:12.889 --> 41:14.722
What about my insanity plea.

41:14.724 --> 41:17.307
I thought that was how you
are going to get me off.

41:17.309 --> 41:22.396
Well, they came
down on the side

41:22.398 --> 41:25.023
of personal responsibility.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.858
But I'm insane.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.735
Clearly, I'm insane.

41:28.737 --> 41:29.987
Well, they don't think so.

41:29.989 --> 41:31.405
Well, what do you think?

41:31.407 --> 41:32.241
Me?

41:37.329 --> 41:45.213
Well, you know, that's not
really for me to decide.

41:45.213 --> 41:47.548
You know, it gets me so angry.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.758
We live in a modern
society in so many ways

41:50.760 --> 41:52.010
but we are still embracing this

41:52.012 --> 41:54.637
archaic eye for an eye system

41:54.639 --> 41:57.767
when we should be
rehabilitating people.

41:59.768 --> 42:01.644
Look, I'm gonna
need to tell them

42:01.646 --> 42:04.315
what you want for
your last meal.

42:05.650 --> 42:07.318
Bill, listen to me.

42:09.070 --> 42:14.075
Look, I had a terrible
time growing up.

42:15.994 --> 42:19.581
My parents were both
strict and indifferent.

42:22.791 --> 42:26.670
I was a poor student.

42:26.670 --> 42:28.545
I had trouble connecting
with my peers.

42:28.547 --> 42:33.427
I barely made my
way through school.

42:33.427 --> 42:37.804
But there's one teacher
who took some time with me.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.893
Showed me a few
chords on the guitar.

42:43.646 --> 42:46.316
And I found this
solace in music.

42:47.233 --> 42:49.527
Gave me a sense of purpose.

42:51.862 --> 42:56.699
And some mates and I
started playing some shows

42:56.701 --> 43:01.539
and got the attention of the
producer and the record label.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.624
And everything
happened so quickly.

43:05.626 --> 43:10.547
Barely had time to think.

43:10.547 --> 43:14.259
I was riding so high on
warmth and adoration.

43:19.599 --> 43:22.849
Then after some
years, things changed.

43:22.851 --> 43:26.480
And the songs didn't
come as easy anymore.

43:27.731 --> 43:31.900
And we've carried on but
it hasn't been the same.

43:31.902 --> 43:35.489
Everything I've ever
known was falling away.

43:37.074 --> 43:42.619
I've realized I don't
even know who I am

43:42.621 --> 43:46.874
because I've never really
taken the time to find out.

43:46.876 --> 43:48.961
Fumbling along in a haze.

43:50.880 --> 44:02.934
Grasping for bits of happiness
and clarity along the way.

44:02.934 --> 44:05.812
I know what's it
like to feel lost.

44:09.148 --> 44:09.982
I do.

44:13.193 --> 44:17.197
I hear you and I see you.

44:20.159 --> 44:22.369
I understand your trouble.

44:24.079 --> 44:25.498
Bill, I'm sorry.

44:29.753 --> 44:32.755
Please, Bill.

44:32.755 --> 44:41.806
I'm not perfect
but I'm a good man.

44:41.806 --> 44:42.639
Please.

44:43.974 --> 44:47.684
Please, you don't
have to do this.

44:47.686 --> 44:50.272
Please, Bill, I'm a human being.

44:51.190 --> 44:52.024
Please.

44:53.193 --> 44:54.858
Please, don't do this.

44:54.860 --> 44:56.445
Not like this.

44:59.324 --> 45:03.034
So, can I put you
down for a cheeseburger?

45:21.596 --> 45:24.766
I want a 20-pound
slow roasted turkey.

45:28.811 --> 45:31.979
It's gotta be
something simple.

45:31.981 --> 45:33.398
Like a pizza or cheeseburger.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.441
Well, it's my last meal.

45:35.443 --> 45:37.193
I should be able to
have what I want.

45:37.195 --> 45:39.405
Pizza or a cheeseburger?

45:47.454 --> 45:48.288
Pizza.

45:50.041 --> 45:51.624
Crust, crispy.

45:51.626 --> 45:54.043
That's a really good choice.

45:54.045 --> 45:55.211
I woulda went with a pizza too.

45:55.213 --> 45:58.008
There's nothing
like a good pizza.

46:15.315 --> 46:20.068
Bill, I don't wanna give
you any false hope here.

46:20.070 --> 46:22.947
Okay, but there's always
a chance that the governor

46:22.949 --> 46:26.117
could change her
mind the last minute.

46:26.119 --> 46:28.663
It's uncommon but it happens.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.005
Has he ever
cheated on you before?

46:40.007 --> 46:43.008
Not since we've been married.

46:43.010 --> 46:45.221
I mean not that I know of.

46:49.016 --> 46:50.766
Just wondering if he's
just fucking the bitch

46:50.768 --> 46:52.269
or of he loves her.

46:53.521 --> 46:56.188
What are you gonna do?

46:56.190 --> 46:57.398
What do you
think I'm gonna do?

46:57.400 --> 46:59.941
I'm gonna run the
bitch over with my car.

46:59.943 --> 47:02.070
What would you do?

47:02.072 --> 47:03.278
I mean you're amazing.

47:03.280 --> 47:06.034
You deserve better.

47:06.034 --> 47:07.410
I would leave him.

47:09.788 --> 47:13.666
I think I like vehicular
manslaughter better.

48:08.887 --> 48:13.976
Well, here we are, Son.

48:13.976 --> 48:15.184
Yeah, I wasn't,

48:15.186 --> 48:17.271
I wasn't gonna come here.

48:19.356 --> 48:24.151
I always thought you would
amount to so much more.

48:24.153 --> 48:25.320
You were my boy.

48:26.322 --> 48:28.575
I'm still your boy, Dad.

48:30.034 --> 48:33.202
Dad, you have to help
me get out of here.

48:33.204 --> 48:34.039
What?

48:35.539 --> 48:39.708
It's gonna be a little hard
with this glass between us

48:39.710 --> 48:42.296
and all these guards.

48:45.132 --> 48:46.925
How could you do this?

48:48.802 --> 48:51.597
How could you
disgrace the family?

48:53.182 --> 48:56.224
You do know that you're
the reason I am like I am.

48:56.226 --> 48:59.479
No, don't put that
fucking shit on me.

48:59.481 --> 49:01.981
Every man makes his
choices in life.

49:01.983 --> 49:02.815
They do that?

49:02.817 --> 49:03.648
They do.

49:03.650 --> 49:05.233
They do.

49:05.235 --> 49:09.072
I never heard anybody that
didn't have it coming to him.

49:09.074 --> 49:11.157
Was there some horrible
way that I wronged you

49:11.159 --> 49:13.994
when I was four, hm?

49:13.994 --> 49:14.871
Is that it?

49:16.206 --> 49:19.581
'Cause you just had to leave
me with my drug addicted mother.

49:19.583 --> 49:22.084
Well, your mother was
a batshit crazy whore,

49:22.086 --> 49:23.588
I'll give you that.

49:26.507 --> 49:30.803
Did you ever hear about
when Mary Beth was raped?

49:32.054 --> 49:34.556
Well, after knocking Mom out,

49:35.724 --> 49:39.267
her boyfriend broke
into our room.

49:39.269 --> 49:43.692
Tied me up with a phone
cord and he raped Mary Beth.

49:47.112 --> 49:49.653
She was wearing this
rainbow underwear

49:49.655 --> 49:53.909
that she got for Christmas.

49:53.909 --> 49:55.703
That poor little girl.

49:56.996 --> 50:05.213
That poor sweet angel.

50:12.262 --> 50:14.804
Look, you let
her get raped.

50:14.806 --> 50:18.224
and you didn't do
a goddamn thing!

50:18.226 --> 50:20.311
Please, I was only seven.

50:51.175 --> 50:53.719
Dad, Dad, you've broken through.

50:56.597 --> 50:59.182
Dad, there's no glass here.

50:59.184 --> 51:01.603
Dad, please, you can help me.

51:08.025 --> 51:12.445
Well, I guess I better
get on down the road.

51:12.447 --> 51:14.280
Dad, please.

51:14.282 --> 51:15.115
Dad.

51:16.326 --> 51:20.202
Please, you have to
help me, Dad, please.

51:20.204 --> 51:23.206
I'll see you on
the other side.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.874
No, Dad, please.

51:24.876 --> 51:26.208
Dad.

51:26.210 --> 51:28.088
Dad, wait!

51:28.088 --> 51:30.006
Please, Dad, come back!

51:35.219 --> 51:36.053
Dad!

51:40.684 --> 51:41.518
Fuck!

51:43.353 --> 51:46.144
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck,

51:46.146 --> 51:48.357
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

51:50.443 --> 51:52.318
I know this is the
third time I've called.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.530
Can you please just check again.

51:55.532 --> 51:57.909
Yes, his name is Craig Owen.

52:02.621 --> 52:06.917
Are you sure no one has
been admitted by that name?

52:08.043 --> 52:11.047
Okay, thank you.

52:58.177 --> 52:59.011
Hi, Mom.

53:01.889 --> 53:04.099
This can't be happening.

53:05.643 --> 53:08.438
Not to you, not
to my sweet Billy.

53:09.646 --> 53:10.481
Not you.

53:12.650 --> 53:16.237
I love you, Mom.

53:16.237 --> 53:19.447
Are you okay, do
you need anything?

53:19.449 --> 53:22.115
You know, I have some money
and I'll leave it here for you.

53:22.117 --> 53:25.787
I'll leave it in your books
and you get like a snack

53:25.789 --> 53:29.539
or a soda or something,
you know, before.

53:29.541 --> 53:30.751
Thanks, Mom.

53:31.710 --> 53:33.420
That would be lovely.

53:34.338 --> 53:37.300
Do you have any water?

53:37.300 --> 53:52.481
No.

53:52.481 --> 53:53.315
You know, I.

53:59.530 --> 54:02.659
I carry this with me.

54:02.659 --> 54:04.325
Do you remember?

54:04.327 --> 54:05.575
Do you remember drawing this?

54:05.577 --> 54:06.788
You were five.

54:07.789 --> 54:10.375
Yeah, I do.

54:13.378 --> 54:15.920
That's me, you and Mary Beth.

54:15.922 --> 54:20.508
It always make me feel
like you're with me.

54:20.510 --> 54:21.344
Oh, god, you.

54:34.648 --> 54:37.566
Baby, can I smoke in here?

54:37.568 --> 54:38.570
Sure, Mom.

54:40.989 --> 54:41.820
Thank, god.

54:41.822 --> 54:44.367
I'm trying to quit.

54:44.367 --> 54:46.661
It's just, with everything.

55:01.384 --> 55:03.050
It's been a bad month.

55:03.052 --> 55:04.385
You know?

55:04.387 --> 55:05.887
It's been a lot.

55:05.889 --> 55:07.599
It's just been a lot.

55:10.434 --> 55:12.061
Can I have some?

55:34.333 --> 55:41.546
You know, I did
everything I did for you.

55:41.548 --> 55:42.548
I did it for you
and your sister.

55:42.550 --> 55:45.258
You know that, right?

55:45.260 --> 55:46.760
I do.

55:46.762 --> 55:49.849
I do, I really do.

55:49.849 --> 55:51.682
I was just trying
to build a new life.

55:51.684 --> 55:53.476
I just thought if we
could get out of the city,

55:53.478 --> 55:55.311
maybe I don't know, go
back to Bakersfield.

55:55.313 --> 55:57.521
You know, you're Uncle Ted.

55:57.523 --> 55:59.691
If I could get a job,
save a little money,

55:59.693 --> 56:02.110
we could get a like
a little house.

56:02.112 --> 56:04.195
Would that have been great?

56:04.197 --> 56:05.987
Yeah, it would.

56:05.989 --> 56:08.532
You know that I
tried to get you back

56:08.534 --> 56:09.950
after they took
you away from me.

56:09.952 --> 56:11.663
You know that, right?

56:13.164 --> 56:16.251
I know, you did
the best you could.

56:17.835 --> 56:19.837
You know, I forgive you.

56:21.297 --> 56:22.132
I do.

56:24.217 --> 56:25.593
Thank you, baby.

56:38.398 --> 56:41.233
I have to go.

56:41.233 --> 56:43.610
No, we still have some time.

56:45.487 --> 56:47.362
I have to go.

56:47.364 --> 56:49.366
Oh, oh, baby.

56:49.867 --> 56:51.450
I'm gonna give this to the court

56:51.452 --> 56:52.702
so they could give this to you

56:52.704 --> 56:55.707
so that you could
have this for when...

56:57.500 --> 56:58.876
You know for when.

57:18.855 --> 57:20.271
You know, I just wish
that they would let me

57:20.273 --> 57:21.731
hug you one more time.

57:21.733 --> 57:23.523
Well, you can, Mom.

57:23.525 --> 57:25.860
You can hug me, please.

57:25.862 --> 57:28.447
Please, I've missed you so much.

57:31.742 --> 57:32.576
Go on.

57:39.833 --> 57:41.541
Mom, Mom, please.

57:41.543 --> 57:43.168
Please, you have to help me.

57:43.170 --> 57:45.671
Please, you have to
help me get out of here.

57:45.673 --> 57:46.755
Please, Mama.

57:46.757 --> 57:48.883
Please, they're doing
bad things to me here.

57:48.885 --> 57:50.885
Please, they're hurting me.

57:50.887 --> 57:52.260
Mama, please.

57:52.262 --> 57:53.554
Mama.

57:53.556 --> 57:55.266
Mama, please, please.

57:56.266 --> 57:57.101
Please.

58:01.106 --> 58:03.733
Please, you have
to do something.

58:09.572 --> 58:10.865
I have to go.

58:24.713 --> 58:27.796
I'm gonna be praying for you.

58:27.798 --> 58:29.673
You stay strong, sweetheart.

58:29.675 --> 58:32.260
Okay, you're gonna be
in a better place soon.

58:32.262 --> 58:33.096
Okay.

58:50.822 --> 58:51.823
Thanks, Mom.

58:52.824 --> 58:53.657
Thank you.

58:55.534 --> 59:07.380
Bye, baby.

59:37.577 --> 59:38.453
Oh, fuck.

59:48.922 --> 59:49.755
Dammit.

59:58.306 --> 59:59.805
Just isn't like him.

59:59.807 --> 01:00:01.807
I mean you know him
better than I do

01:00:01.809 --> 01:00:05.061
but it just doesn't seem
like something he would do.

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:08.606
Let's just try calling
him from your phone.

01:00:08.608 --> 01:00:10.900
You know, maybe he'll pick up.

01:00:10.902 --> 01:00:12.403
Yeah, sure, okay.

01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:20.784
I'm just curious.

01:00:20.786 --> 01:00:23.287
Why is my husband's
contact in your phone?

01:00:23.289 --> 01:00:25.583
Kelly, we're all friends.

01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:29.170
I know, it just seems weird.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.923
I can take it out if it
makes you uncomfortable.

01:00:33.925 --> 01:00:34.759
It's fine.

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:02.952
Shut your mouth.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:03.786
What?

01:01:03.788 --> 01:01:04.954
Close it.

01:01:04.956 --> 01:01:06.121
What?

01:01:06.123 --> 01:01:07.456
I'm not gonna yell.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:08.292
What?

01:01:35.152 --> 01:01:37.446
Whoa, sat on my baton.

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:43.161
Dammit.

01:01:44.704 --> 01:01:46.331
Where's that pizza?

01:01:51.126 --> 01:01:54.836
You know, I delivered
pizza in high school.

01:01:54.838 --> 01:01:56.255
Wasn't bad, decent tips.

01:01:56.257 --> 01:02:00.550
Every time they screwed up
an order, I'd get to eat it.

01:02:00.552 --> 01:02:03.512
This one time, a lady
came to the door.

01:02:03.514 --> 01:02:04.847
She invited me in.

01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:06.224
I mean she's not hot or anything

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.016
but when you're in high
school, who cares, right?

01:02:08.018 --> 01:02:10.978
Fuck it, I still don't.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.567
Dammit, don't they know
we're short on time?

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:22.324
Finally.

01:02:29.916 --> 01:02:31.042
Listen to me.

01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.876
If you like your cock and balls
where they are,

01:02:33.878 --> 01:02:35.878
then that duct tape's
gonna stay on your face

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.630
until I get back down here.

01:02:37.632 --> 01:02:39.634
You got it?

01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:41.510
Good.

01:02:57.443 --> 01:03:00.029
It's 19.44.

01:03:16.003 --> 01:03:18.086
A little something
for the effort?

01:03:27.014 --> 01:03:30.225
My wife and I, we
like to role play.

01:03:32.978 --> 01:03:36.733
Do you wanna join us?

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.318
No, I'm good, man.

01:03:40.737 --> 01:03:41.570
Weird.

01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:11.932
Figured you'd want a beer.

01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:14.519
Gotta a couple in the
cooler in my truck.

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:19.109
I know I'd want one if I'm
sitting where you're sitting.

01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:29.200
Aw, you
son of a bitch.

01:04:31.496 --> 01:04:41.047
What was that?

01:04:57.813 --> 01:05:00.399
Oh, that smells good.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:06.237
Pepperoni, you know that's the
most popular pizza topping?

01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:08.280
A little fun fact for you.

01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:09.990
That crust doesn't
look very crispy.

01:05:09.992 --> 01:05:13.079
Eat it.

01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:13.911
Okay, I just I wanna go home.

01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:15.789
Okay, it's just my job.

01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:50.325
I heard about that prick who
cut your fingers off.

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:55.119
I'll tell you this, if
you ever get shanked,

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:57.039
I'd look the other way.

01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:02.253
If you look the other
way, I'll shank you myself.

01:06:08.092 --> 01:06:10.133
So the doc got you all sewed up.

01:06:10.135 --> 01:06:13.137
Is that what you call that?

01:06:13.139 --> 01:06:14.766
Yeah, he's good.

01:06:16.141 --> 01:06:17.726
Fucking barbarian.

01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:22.565
Well, better go now.

01:06:26.652 --> 01:06:27.860
That's it?

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:30.572
Yeah.

01:06:30.572 --> 01:06:33.115
You have some
interesting tattoo.

01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:34.494
What does it mean?

01:06:35.744 --> 01:06:38.748
It's a Gemini.

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:39.581
The twin.

01:06:51.344 --> 01:06:54.387
Bianca, where were
you Thursday night?

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:55.222
What?

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:58.641
Thursday night,
where were you?

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:03.229
I don't remember, I think
I went out with a friend,

01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:04.065
Who?

01:07:06.067 --> 01:07:08.652
Danielle, why?

01:07:11.155 --> 01:07:12.449
Just curious.

01:11:08.518 --> 01:11:11.104
My son, I'm Father Fitzgerald.

01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:15.275
I'm here for you.

01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:21.862
If you'd like to
talk, we can talk

01:11:21.864 --> 01:11:24.322
about anything you like.

01:11:24.324 --> 01:11:30.204
God, football, politics.

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:38.006
You could do a confession.

01:11:38.006 --> 01:11:42.926
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:43.761
It's been.

01:11:48.766 --> 01:11:50.474
Well, I have no idea
how long it's been

01:11:50.476 --> 01:11:52.519
since my last confession.

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.900
I accuse myself of
the following sins.

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:03.573
I've killed seven people.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:09.535
I've tortured them
in unspeakable ways.

01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:12.332
Was it sexual
in nature, my son?

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.506
It was, wasn't it?

01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:29.599
For these sins and all
the sins of my past life,

01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:37.524
I ask absolution

01:12:37.524 --> 01:12:39.818
and penance from you, Father.

01:12:41.444 --> 01:12:44.403
Are you sorry for your sins?

01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:46.783
Would you like to be forgiven?

01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:52.622
Yes, you too can be forgiven.

01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:56.458
You can.

01:12:58.627 --> 01:13:00.630
You're a good person, Bill.

01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:06.594
You just got deal a bad hand.

01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:11.807
I see you, Bill.

01:13:17.271 --> 01:13:18.105
Please.

01:13:21.443 --> 01:13:22.819
You can stop this.

01:13:26.113 --> 01:13:27.322
Just untie me.

01:13:29.908 --> 01:13:30.743
Let me go.

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:35.164
I will help you.

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:42.463
You can confess and be
absolved of your sins.

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:50.221
You can get free from
the devil's grasp.

01:13:53.682 --> 01:13:56.353
I know you don't
want to do this.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:02.608
I know that you
have heard me, Bill.

01:14:07.529 --> 01:14:10.949
It's tough sometimes.

01:14:10.949 --> 01:14:14.953
This job, you get emotional.

01:14:17.582 --> 01:14:18.416
I'm sorry.

01:14:25.923 --> 01:14:29.426
Would you like to take
communion, my son?

01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:33.305
Yes.

01:14:45.234 --> 01:14:50.447
The body of Christ,
the bread of heaven.

01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:11.845
The blood of Christ,
the cup of salvation.

01:15:30.447 --> 01:15:33.990
May the body and blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:39.663
keep you in eternal salvation.

01:15:56.096 --> 01:15:57.014
Fuck you.

01:15:58.807 --> 01:16:06.483
Fuck you and your god.

01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:08.485
You nasty fuck.

01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:12.780
And I forgive you, my son.

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:21.204
Bill.

01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:25.583
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

01:16:25.585 --> 01:16:28.380
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

01:16:29.838 --> 01:16:32.924
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:35.009
Give us
our daily bread.

01:16:35.011 --> 01:16:37.803
Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those

01:16:37.805 --> 01:16:40.850
who trespass against us.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:43.436
And lead us not into temptation,

01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:49.484
but deliver us from evil.

01:16:50.984 --> 01:16:51.819
Amen.

01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:35.738
Don't do this.

01:17:38.908 --> 01:17:39.743
No.

01:17:44.872 --> 01:17:46.665
Don't do this, please.

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:50.253
No, please.

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:56.592
No!

01:17:59.887 --> 01:18:00.721
No!

01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:12.317
Please!

01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.404
Please, don't!

01:18:16.404 --> 01:18:18.153
Please, Bill.

01:18:18.155 --> 01:18:20.367
Please, I don't wanna die.

01:18:21.868 --> 01:18:23.870
I don't wanna die, Bill.

01:18:25.412 --> 01:18:29.792
I don't wanna die, I don't
wanna die, I don't want.

01:18:30.542 --> 01:18:31.377
I want to live!

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.675
Please.

01:18:41.762 --> 01:18:45.015
Please, I have to say
goodbye to my wife.

01:18:48.895 --> 01:18:50.855
I have to leave a message!

01:18:52.023 --> 01:18:53.397
Let me!

01:18:53.399 --> 01:18:55.944
Let me, please!

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:59.823
Let me say goodbye, let me.

01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:00.865
Please, let me.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:12.668
My wife, I love you.

01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:15.046
I love you, my wife.

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:19.009
My wife, I love you.

01:19:23.012 --> 01:19:29.019
Kelly, I love you, baby,
I'm so sorry.

01:19:29.019 --> 01:19:29.894
I'm so sorry.

01:19:34.481 --> 01:19:35.772
I love you.

01:19:35.774 --> 01:19:36.608
No, wait!

01:19:40.029 --> 01:19:41.197
Please!

01:19:47.996 --> 01:19:48.829
Don't, no.

01:20:00.716 --> 01:20:03.384
Don't do this, you
don't want to do this.

01:20:03.386 --> 01:20:05.093
I know that you don't.

01:20:09.725 --> 01:20:11.351
Please, don't do that, don't!

01:20:11.353 --> 01:20:12.977
Don't do that!

01:20:12.979 --> 01:20:14.564
Don't, don't, don't!

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:17.900
Oh, fuck!

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:21.112
No, no!

01:20:22.613 --> 01:20:23.447
No, Bill.

01:20:25.783 --> 01:20:27.159
Don't do it, Bill!

01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:29.910
No!

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:30.746
No!

01:20:31.538 --> 01:20:32.373
No!

01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:35.335
No!

01:20:36.752 --> 01:20:40.256
Fuck you, no!

01:20:40.256 --> 01:20:41.091
No!

01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:44.008
No!

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.218
Fucking terrible I have to be!

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.428
Fuck me!

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:49.263
No, please, no, don't!

01:20:49.265 --> 01:20:50.973
No!

01:20:50.975 --> 01:20:51.810
No!

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.855
No, stop it!

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.014
He went to the store and
I haven't seen him since.

01:22:14.016 --> 01:22:17.018
He's not answering his phone.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.268
Yes, I've called the police

01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:21.565
but they won't do
anything for 24 hours.

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:26.986
Hang on, there's a police
officer at the door.

01:22:26.988 --> 01:22:28.490
I'll call you back.

01:22:44.922 --> 01:22:45.756
Well?

01:22:51.637 --> 01:22:52.639
It's done.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:07.528
Now, be a dear and take out
the trash on your way out.

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:31.176
You're a tough guy to find.

01:23:35.597 --> 01:23:37.098
In for the cookies.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.020
Sure.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.481
What have you been up to?

01:23:44.481 --> 01:23:50.361
Oh, same old. You know.

01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:52.490
How's the acting going?

01:23:53.824 --> 01:23:59.286
Mm-hm, yeah, it's, um,

01:23:59.288 --> 01:24:00.122
it's good.

01:24:01.457 --> 01:24:06.587
Have you heard about
this Gemini killer?

01:24:06.587 --> 01:24:09.213
Yeah, some, some, some.

01:24:09.215 --> 01:24:10.717
How does it feel?

01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:14.009
What?

01:24:14.011 --> 01:24:17.181
To cut someone's head
off with a blowtorch.

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:22.101
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:24:22.103 --> 01:24:24.644
Come on, carving the Gemini
sign into your victims,

01:24:24.646 --> 01:24:29.652
wrapping their head in a
green towel with duct tape?

01:24:30.278 --> 01:24:32.697
My twin brother is
a serial killer.

01:24:34.073 --> 01:24:36.326
How many people can say that?

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.915
Sweetheart, it's me.

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:47.337
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

01:24:47.337 --> 01:24:52.634
I do need you to do
something for me though.

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:53.467
What?

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:57.055
I want you to kill my husband.

01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:05.102
Why would I kill your husband?

01:25:05.104 --> 01:25:09.359
Because he's fucking
my best friend.

01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:11.275
Just get a divorce.

01:25:11.277 --> 01:25:12.112
Prenup.

01:25:14.488 --> 01:25:15.489
Right.

01:25:17.074 --> 01:25:19.909
You can back to killing
random street people later.

01:25:19.911 --> 01:25:22.411
They're not random.

01:25:22.413 --> 01:25:24.873
I need you to do this for me.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:26.792
Okay?

01:25:28.627 --> 01:25:29.461
For me.

01:25:45.147 --> 01:25:50.147
