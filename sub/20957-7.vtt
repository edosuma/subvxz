WEBVTT

00:07.219 --> 00:10.078
Previously on Wynonna Earp...

00:10.081 --> 00:12.601
- You're injured.
- That's no ordinary gun.

00:12.604 --> 00:15.359
- I have to find this psycho named Tucker.
- Ugh!

00:15.361 --> 00:17.007
Constance. He killed the Stone Witch.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.363
- That little Tucker is dead.
- Wynonna's pregnant.

00:19.365 --> 00:21.031
- You're...
- Knocked up.

00:21.033 --> 00:24.535
- Everything's changed.
- Wanted you to hear it from me.

00:24.537 --> 00:25.640
Give her this.

00:25.643 --> 00:27.805
It always comes back to
the Curse, Waves, always.

00:27.807 --> 00:30.617
- I wasn't the heir.
- You're not even an Earp.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.043
The Seven are gone.

00:34.712 --> 00:36.079
Just like that, huh?

00:38.116 --> 00:40.884
Marshals! Come out with your hands up!

00:40.886 --> 00:42.920
Tucker Gardner, we're here for you,

00:42.922 --> 00:45.255
- you little skidmark.
- Help us.

00:45.257 --> 00:48.359
- Help!
- I'm gonna go.

00:48.361 --> 00:51.328
Wynonna?

00:51.330 --> 00:54.138
- Thank God you came!
- Where's your deviant brother?

00:54.141 --> 00:57.468
You don't have him? Great
police work, just stellar.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.370
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm...

00:59.372 --> 01:02.206
I'm just really freaked
out and, um, angry.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.775
I'll check the bedrooms.

01:04.777 --> 01:06.777
The last thing we
remember, we passed out,

01:06.779 --> 01:09.480
and then we woke up locked in this room.

01:10.715 --> 01:12.683
While you say you were asleep,

01:12.685 --> 01:14.752
Pervert Gardner Junior

01:14.754 --> 01:17.488
kidnapped a girl and held
her in my sister's bedroom.

01:19.124 --> 01:22.126
I wish I could say I didn't know
it was just a matter of time.

01:22.128 --> 01:23.927
Tucker's out of his
tree. He must have roofied

01:23.929 --> 01:25.963
- the Pinot Grigio.
- So you two don't happen

01:25.965 --> 01:27.564
to know a couple of
bitches who like to get

01:27.566 --> 01:29.600
their Halloween on in
creepy, black dresses?

01:29.602 --> 01:32.253
Umm, no idea what you're talking about.

01:33.304 --> 01:36.607
You sure you're not
just hormonal? Mazel Tov.

01:36.609 --> 01:38.075
We've been locked in here for days.

01:38.077 --> 01:40.511
We're victims, just like everyone else!

01:40.513 --> 01:41.945
Everyone?

01:41.947 --> 01:43.672
Yeah.

01:43.675 --> 01:46.650
She doesn't need a backrub. We
need you to get your ass in gear

01:46.652 --> 01:48.919
- and find Tucker.
- Frankly, he terrifies me.

01:51.856 --> 01:54.158
We'll be watching the house 24-7.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.260
You're watching us?!
What... what the hell?

01:56.262 --> 01:58.595
It's for your protection.

01:58.597 --> 02:00.597
Yeah, just in case he comes back.

02:00.599 --> 02:02.599
If you have nothing to
hide, what's the problem?

02:02.601 --> 02:04.735
We're not like our brother.

02:04.737 --> 02:06.537
I thought you of all
people would get that.

02:08.273 --> 02:10.340
Nah, sorry. I don't have time

02:10.342 --> 02:12.810
- to play nice anymore.
- Here's our card.

02:12.812 --> 02:15.779
Let us know if you see him.

02:22.954 --> 02:25.522
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure yet,

02:25.524 --> 02:27.324
- but I feel it in my gut.
- Huh?

02:27.326 --> 02:29.226
- Don't look at my gut.
- Oh, sorry.

02:29.228 --> 02:31.228
Uh, have you seen a doctor or...?

02:31.230 --> 02:33.030
- Mercedes wasn't Mercedes!
- Mm-hmm?

02:33.032 --> 02:35.299
Usually, she's a fun
bitch, not a bitch bitch,

02:35.301 --> 02:37.901
which is like "Whoa, bitch," but...

02:37.903 --> 02:40.088
- It's a bitch thing.
- Yeah, clearly.

02:40.091 --> 02:42.639
Tucker had Hypnos put the
town to sleep for the Widows.

02:42.641 --> 02:44.675
Are the Gardner sisters
working for them too?

02:44.677 --> 02:47.244
I don't have the resources
to monitor this place 24-7,

02:47.246 --> 02:49.680
but I've learned to
trust your instincts.

02:49.682 --> 02:51.858
Well, I hope so 'cause

02:51.861 --> 02:55.051
not being able to trust
anyone ever, it's just...

02:55.054 --> 02:57.521
Super lonely. Yeah, I feel you, bitch.

02:57.523 --> 02:59.690
You can't say that,

02:59.692 --> 03:01.309
that's our... Ooh!

03:01.312 --> 03:04.527
- Head rush.
- Hey, you're alright? Listen,

03:04.530 --> 03:06.563
if you want to be in the field,
you're gonna get some sort

03:06.565 --> 03:09.066
- of health clearance, OK?
- Oh, I just need

03:09.068 --> 03:10.834
yogurt, stat.

03:10.836 --> 03:13.470
OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

03:13.472 --> 03:14.671
Oh.

03:17.041 --> 03:18.842
Hey, Doc.

03:18.844 --> 03:20.577
We got a Code Rainbow.

03:20.579 --> 03:22.412
We should have claimed new faces

03:22.414 --> 03:24.214
when we had the chance.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.517
She knows it was us.
She was checking my arm.

03:26.519 --> 03:28.519
If she touched me, I
would have screamed.

03:28.521 --> 03:30.257
- We should go.
- The Gardners disappear

03:30.260 --> 03:32.374
from Purgatory, they'll
be even more suspicious.

03:35.176 --> 03:37.403
We can't risk them finding this.

03:37.406 --> 03:40.197
That little shit killed one
of the two people who knew

03:40.199 --> 03:42.065
how to find the third seal.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.499
Hm, Tucker,

03:43.502 --> 03:45.903
he was simply too... human.

03:45.905 --> 03:48.272
As for his little gift...

03:48.274 --> 03:50.574
Maybe Constance can still

03:50.576 --> 03:53.043
- help us.
- We can't hurt her anymore.

03:53.045 --> 03:55.913
If we can't hurt her,
we can't trust her.

04:00.985 --> 04:03.887
We need to work fast, keep
Wynonna and that gun away

04:03.889 --> 04:06.056
until we find the last seal.

04:06.058 --> 04:07.624
And then...

04:07.626 --> 04:10.394
Our love burns bright and true.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.966
Holliday.

04:18.337 --> 04:21.738
Wake up.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.340
- Reeves!
- Hmm?

04:23.342 --> 04:25.917
- Wake up.
- Uh...

04:27.478 --> 04:30.347
- Did I fall asleep?
- I did it.

04:30.349 --> 04:31.815
I found him.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.955
You found him? Are you certain, Charlie?

04:37.957 --> 04:39.556
He has been decloaked.

04:39.558 --> 04:42.326
Alright.

04:42.328 --> 04:44.261
I knew you could do it.

04:44.263 --> 04:45.829
Fetch me my pistol.

04:45.831 --> 04:49.600
Still, after all these years.

04:51.570 --> 04:53.604
No matter.

04:53.606 --> 04:55.906
This one's worth the wait.

04:55.908 --> 04:57.341
Mark him with fire.

04:57.343 --> 04:58.976
We need to do this one by the book.

05:02.337 --> 05:05.339
Doc Holiday will hang for his crimes.

05:34.195 --> 05:37.514
- These Widows, what are they?
- Unclassified entities.

05:37.516 --> 05:39.616
They broke out of BBD containment

05:39.618 --> 05:41.084
thanks to Doc's dynamite.

05:41.086 --> 05:44.087
Not that I blame him for anything.

05:44.089 --> 05:46.056
"Unclassified"?

05:46.058 --> 05:48.358
Well, BBD is a big,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.027
bureaucratic place.

05:50.029 --> 05:51.995
We hadn't gotten
around to examining them

05:51.997 --> 05:54.097
yet. They were sealed

05:54.099 --> 05:56.099
in that shipping container
for over a century.

05:56.102 --> 05:58.657
Together? Hope they had mints.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.704
That's why we didn't know

06:00.706 --> 06:02.506
about the paralyzing venom.

06:02.508 --> 06:05.042
Yeah, which hurts like
a mother. Oh, no offense.

06:05.044 --> 06:07.210
What we do know is

06:07.212 --> 06:09.913
that they've destroyed
two seals and are tearing

06:09.915 --> 06:11.782
Purgatory apart to find the third.

06:11.784 --> 06:14.751
Yes. Still working on the why.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.670
Hey, I've translated some of the text

06:16.673 --> 06:18.306
from one of the seal fragments.

06:18.309 --> 06:21.776
It's ancient Phoenician.
"Let Thee Rise."

06:21.779 --> 06:23.760
"Let Thee Rise"?

06:23.762 --> 06:26.463
Dramatic. Ominous.

06:26.465 --> 06:28.432
My least favourite Boyz II Men album.

06:29.901 --> 06:32.135
OK, so why didn't
Tucker get breath bombed?

06:32.137 --> 06:35.138
Huh? And how did they recruit him?

06:35.140 --> 06:37.941
They needed him. He's
always been a royal dink,

06:37.943 --> 06:40.911
and evil sniffs out evil, like cancer.

06:40.913 --> 06:43.947
- And Mercedes and Beth?
- They also have something to do with this.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.750
The doctor is in.

06:46.752 --> 06:49.252
- Here's your patient.
- The pregnant one?

06:49.254 --> 06:51.388
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:53.091 --> 06:55.425
Can I examine you somewhere private?

06:55.427 --> 06:57.828
Dude, it's how I got into this mess

06:57.830 --> 07:00.364
in the first place. Ugh!

07:02.240 --> 07:05.509
Not often am I whisked away in a
shroud of secrecy by two burly men.

07:07.105 --> 07:09.473
If you're being held against your will,

07:09.475 --> 07:11.808
wave around your yogurt spoon.

07:11.810 --> 07:14.778
Just overprotective coworkers.

07:14.780 --> 07:18.148
They don't want the bad guys
to know I'm marshaling for two.

07:18.150 --> 07:20.459
Well, the heartbeat is... strong.

07:21.652 --> 07:23.720
Uh, how long since your last period?

07:23.722 --> 07:25.655
Oof, can't say I miss

07:25.657 --> 07:27.858
the ole gal or had been
tracking her visits.

07:27.860 --> 07:30.794
- Have you been pregnant before?
- Heh heh! Not that I know of.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.796
Smoking?

07:32.798 --> 07:34.965
- It makes my hair smell gross.
- Drinking?

07:40.304 --> 07:42.305
This... this whole thing

07:42.307 --> 07:44.641
- took me by surprise.
- I'm here

07:44.643 --> 07:47.411
to assess your health and
the baby's, not to judge.

07:50.214 --> 07:52.682
Sorry, judge is sort of a trigger word.

07:55.086 --> 07:57.087
You're very nice. Thank you for that.

07:57.089 --> 07:59.890
Umm, what about genetic testing?

07:59.892 --> 08:01.758
'Cause my family's
history is pretty fakakte.

08:03.294 --> 08:04.995
That should have been done months ago.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.865
- Only blood samples.
- Samples-sss?

08:08.867 --> 08:11.668
From you and, if possible, the father?

08:13.538 --> 08:15.672
Regardless,

08:15.674 --> 08:17.507
this is the last time

08:17.509 --> 08:19.776
I make a cloak-and-dagger
trip to the middle of nowhere.

08:19.778 --> 08:22.712
Next appointment is in my
office with my equipment,

08:22.714 --> 08:24.681
where I can examine you properly.

08:24.683 --> 08:26.349
Is it Bring your own speculum?

08:28.186 --> 08:30.187
Hey. So how is she?

08:30.189 --> 08:32.121
Doctor-patient privilege ring a bell?

08:34.025 --> 08:37.227
Take it outside, cowboy.
Now, who's driving me back?

08:37.229 --> 08:39.496
- I will. Hey, Jeremy.
- Hey, yo.

08:39.498 --> 08:42.198
Listen, you and me

08:42.201 --> 08:45.035
- surveillance, alright?
- OK, yeah. Me with you

08:45.037 --> 08:46.903
- in the field like...
- Shhh! This ain't tickets

08:46.905 --> 08:49.139
- to Cosmic-con, alright?
- Comic-con?

08:49.141 --> 08:52.175
Quiet. First rule of
stakeout: mouth shut. Got it?

08:57.149 --> 08:59.149
She's strong.

08:59.151 --> 09:01.184
The baby will be too.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.211
Hey, go outside.

09:06.924 --> 09:08.825
Smoke, shoot things.

09:10.561 --> 09:12.295
I do need to stay sharp.

09:16.434 --> 09:19.236
I wonder how many generations
have surveyed this land.

09:21.539 --> 09:24.107
An Earp and a Holliday.

09:24.109 --> 09:26.743
- Damn.
- Did you say "Holliday"?

09:26.745 --> 09:30.262
- Doc Holliday?
- You lost, son?

09:31.415 --> 09:33.674
Holy crow! Are you really him?

09:33.677 --> 09:37.087
Don't be foolish. Fanboys...

09:40.626 --> 09:43.293
Whatever the hell you are,
you should not be on this land.

09:46.997 --> 09:50.466
I'm starting to think you're
not here for my autograph.

09:50.469 --> 09:53.570
So, Doc's outside.

09:53.572 --> 09:55.539
Yeah, I think it's, uh,

09:55.541 --> 09:57.908
- starting to settle in.
- Mm-hmm.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.342
Him being a dad.

09:59.344 --> 10:01.745
- Did he say that?
- No,

10:01.747 --> 10:04.114
but you know Doc, right?

10:04.116 --> 10:06.983
The more he feels, the less he says.

10:06.985 --> 10:08.393
Like a masseuse.

10:08.396 --> 10:10.954
Waves...

10:14.023 --> 10:17.610
they need blood samples from both
parents to do genetic testing.

10:18.763 --> 10:22.165
- He's gonna freak out.
- Why? Doc's scared of needles?

10:22.167 --> 10:24.634
No, he's not scared
of anything. It's me.

10:26.304 --> 10:27.837
I'm terrified. I don't...

10:29.941 --> 10:32.976
Aaah! I don't wanna
tell him! Oh, my God!

10:32.978 --> 10:35.712
Wynonna, what? What's going on?

10:35.714 --> 10:37.335
Hmmm...

10:37.338 --> 10:40.205
Just that Doc might not be the dad.

10:44.055 --> 10:45.188
Then who is?

10:47.358 --> 10:50.290
Don't shoot, I'm just the messenger.

10:50.293 --> 10:52.362
Despite my reputation,

10:52.364 --> 10:54.751
I've never been one to gun down a child.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.701
Who said anything about guns?

10:57.703 --> 10:59.836
- What the hell do you want?
- A warrant was filed

10:59.838 --> 11:02.405
against you in Colorado
in the year 1882.

11:02.407 --> 11:05.642
- It was a long time ago.
- For 135 years, you hid.

11:05.644 --> 11:08.411
- A witch threw me in a well!
- That was stupid.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.879
Aaargh!

11:16.882 --> 11:18.421
Goddammit!

11:20.324 --> 11:22.225
You've been marked with fire for capture

11:22.227 --> 11:24.060
and execution.

11:24.062 --> 11:27.197
I suggest you get your affairs
in order. He's coming for you.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.336
Let him come.

11:36.191 --> 11:39.118
Oh, my God! Oh, my actual God!
Doc's gonna freak right out!

11:39.121 --> 11:41.302
- Yeah? More than you are?
- He'll be crushed.

11:41.304 --> 11:42.937
Or relieved!

11:42.939 --> 11:45.173
Hey, Doc "No strings attached" Holliday!

11:45.175 --> 11:46.908
Are you serious? He's all strings.

11:46.910 --> 11:49.010
He's nothing but strings.
He's like a, like a,

11:49.012 --> 11:50.812
like a marionette puppy.

11:50.814 --> 11:53.114
How could this happen?

11:53.116 --> 11:56.151
Would you like me to draw
you a diagram? 'Cause I will.

11:56.153 --> 11:58.486
Look, Doc and I,

11:58.488 --> 12:01.322
we didn't promise each other anything,

12:01.324 --> 12:03.925
so we can be grownups about this.

12:03.927 --> 12:06.828
- He's gonna shoot everything.
- OK, you are kicking ass

12:06.830 --> 12:08.830
and not helping right
now. Just so you know.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.300
OK.

12:12.302 --> 12:14.703
Grownups or not,

12:14.705 --> 12:16.971
I'll be here when you tell him.

12:16.973 --> 12:19.474
OK? Full support.

12:20.676 --> 12:23.378
- Hi! Henry!
- Hahaha!

12:25.181 --> 12:27.615
- Yeah, gotta go.
- Yeah, I should go too. I...

12:27.617 --> 12:30.351
No, we should...

12:30.353 --> 12:33.154
we should talk.

12:39.295 --> 12:41.096
I never thanked you for your note.

12:42.898 --> 12:46.167
It-it really mattered. So...

12:49.171 --> 12:50.905
May I ask...

12:54.588 --> 12:57.590
are you doing alright?

12:59.415 --> 13:00.915
Of course you can ask.

13:00.917 --> 13:03.585
Things have changed since my day

13:03.587 --> 13:06.114
regarding male participation
in these matters...

13:07.022 --> 13:09.057
but I'll be as involved as you desire.

13:09.059 --> 13:10.911
No more, no less.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.596
All I want, and excuse me

13:14.598 --> 13:17.198
for being old-fashioned,
is for you to be healthy...

13:21.237 --> 13:24.468
for you to be as close
to happy as possible.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.441
And I will do anything,

13:26.443 --> 13:29.010
I will give anything to ensure it.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.217
You're such an asshole.

13:36.219 --> 13:38.920
Maybe I said it wrong.

13:43.826 --> 13:45.059
Uh...

13:47.129 --> 13:49.697
The doctor wants us to do blood tests.

13:49.699 --> 13:52.020
Of course. Is there anything else?

13:55.137 --> 13:58.173
I... I feel like "asshole"
pretty much covered it.

14:02.444 --> 14:04.112
Well then, I'll leave you to it.

14:25.134 --> 14:27.168
Doc. Hey.

14:29.471 --> 14:32.607
- Wait, Doc!
- Not now, Waverley.

14:32.609 --> 14:34.542
No... Doc!

14:41.952 --> 14:44.710
Oh, come on now, you
cursed piece of junk!

14:50.292 --> 14:52.894
Nicole, hey. I need a favour.

15:05.297 --> 15:07.842
Keep flashing that smile and
she'll fall in love with ya.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.811
I told you not to make this weird.

15:09.813 --> 15:12.180
I didn't say I wouldn't.

15:12.182 --> 15:13.982
What are you watching for?

15:13.984 --> 15:15.890
Evil.

15:15.893 --> 15:17.785
Like a basic general evil?

15:17.787 --> 15:19.220
Don't drop those on my floor.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.556
Ah.

15:21.558 --> 15:23.491
Guess, uh, no more Black Badge

15:23.493 --> 15:25.493
means the ban on
co-worker hook-ups is over.

15:26.996 --> 15:28.830
You know, Wynonna is having Doc's baby,

15:28.832 --> 15:30.498
that's just like...

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
crazy.

15:32.502 --> 15:34.903
I mean, imagine the
little rascal if he has

15:34.905 --> 15:37.906
Doc's piercing blue eyes
and Wynonna's luscious hair.

15:37.908 --> 15:40.341
I swear, seriously, we are
going to be defenseless against

15:40.343 --> 15:42.710
such a glorious creature.
You think they're gonna get,

15:42.712 --> 15:44.846
like, a nanny? Or a "manny."

15:44.848 --> 15:46.805
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it,

15:46.808 --> 15:49.250
but I wouldn't say no to
some sort of light babysitting

15:49.252 --> 15:52.023
or daycare dates. I don't
know, one or the other.

15:52.026 --> 15:53.726
Hey, what was the
first rule of stakeout?

15:54.857 --> 15:56.897
- Shutting up, yeah.
- Yeah, you got it. Please now.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.482
Man...

16:01.397 --> 16:03.498
Must be an easier way
to find these Widows.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.768
Lure them or bait them.

16:09.171 --> 16:10.905
Oh, God!

16:14.443 --> 16:16.644
- Oh, my God!
- Can you blow your nose please?

16:16.646 --> 16:19.547
No, no, no way. Not... on this.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.783
This is a... I found this on the floor

16:21.785 --> 16:24.852
of Shorty's basement after
the Widows disappeared.

16:24.854 --> 16:27.622
- Looks like one of their veils.
- Oh, God!

16:27.624 --> 16:29.090
Probably still some venom on it.

16:30.392 --> 16:32.312
That must have fell off
when Wynonna shot them.

16:34.897 --> 16:36.931
Alright, listen, we're gonna
bag this up, OK? We're gonna do

16:36.933 --> 16:39.867
an analysis on it, see if
there's any unique components,

16:39.869 --> 16:42.737
find out where they are
and then we trace 'em.

16:42.739 --> 16:44.405
Yeah, you're a genius!

16:44.407 --> 16:46.774
You're like Rizzoli and Isles combined.

16:48.344 --> 16:49.444
Shutting up.

16:50.946 --> 16:52.313
Waverly left.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.482
Cellphones, people, use 'em.

16:54.484 --> 16:56.444
You'll have to take a
raincheck on the ol' pop-by.

16:57.752 --> 17:00.096
Nicole, I'm leaving. Don't
make me belly-bump you.

17:00.099 --> 17:03.091
Look, who would I rather
piss off? You or your sister?

17:04.326 --> 17:05.803
Waverly sent you to babysit.

17:05.806 --> 17:08.624
- Well, "mommysit" technically.
- Ew!

17:09.765 --> 17:12.333
I am not to let you out of
my sight until she comes back.

17:12.335 --> 17:16.002
You're going through a lot, and she
doesn't want you to be alone right now.

17:16.005 --> 17:18.271
Fine. To the bar.

17:18.273 --> 17:20.575
That's a little early to hit Shorty's.

17:20.577 --> 17:23.176
Not Shorty's. It's an away game.

17:23.179 --> 17:24.579
You're coming or what?

17:25.814 --> 17:28.790
- I guess I'm drinking for two.
- Three.

17:30.277 --> 17:31.777
I hate doing it everything sober.

17:36.793 --> 17:38.860
Whoa...

17:38.862 --> 17:41.596
So much for being grownups about it.

17:41.598 --> 17:43.598
I am too occupied to translate

17:43.600 --> 17:46.467
whatever cryptic thing
you are telling me.

17:46.469 --> 17:48.870
I just hope all this
ammo isn't target practice

17:48.872 --> 17:50.738
on every guy in town who's
ever looked at Wynonna

17:50.740 --> 17:53.741
- with a tinkle in his... eye.
- You cannot possibly understand

17:53.743 --> 17:56.511
what I am dealing with at this time.

17:56.513 --> 17:59.881
Doc, you're still a part of this family,

17:59.883 --> 18:01.462
even if the baby isn't yours.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.555
Ohhh, poop.

18:07.557 --> 18:09.090
She didn't tell you.

18:10.626 --> 18:12.527
Oh, God, I...

18:15.031 --> 18:17.098
Could be she'll be better off.

18:22.539 --> 18:24.705
Hey, everybody, put your hands together

18:24.707 --> 18:27.108
for your favourite: Jesse!

18:28.745 --> 18:30.778
So this is Pussy Willows, huh?

18:30.780 --> 18:33.514
Wrong side of the wrong
side of the tracks.

18:33.516 --> 18:36.236
What kind of girls end up
working in a place like this?

18:37.319 --> 18:39.353
Well, maybe one with no family,

18:39.355 --> 18:41.322
a reputation for
conjuring up fake demons

18:41.324 --> 18:44.092
and no other way to raise money
for a bus ticket out of here?

18:44.094 --> 18:46.194
Where you been, Aphrodite?

18:46.196 --> 18:47.995
Oh, hello. 'Sup, TJ?

18:47.997 --> 18:50.531
I have my period, so you'll have to...

18:50.533 --> 18:53.351
Who's Aphro...? Ohhh.

18:55.604 --> 18:58.773
Pace yourself, there's...
so much more to judge.

18:58.775 --> 19:01.275
I came here a few months ago, when

19:01.277 --> 19:03.940
I got so drunk even Shorty's
wouldn't serve me anymore,

19:03.943 --> 19:07.081
- and I did something.
- What?

19:08.684 --> 19:10.384
Him.

19:10.386 --> 19:11.619
Ah!

19:11.621 --> 19:13.554
Well, drunk Wynonna

19:13.556 --> 19:15.423
- still has standards.
- Yeah.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.291
No beer goggles here.

19:17.293 --> 19:19.483
Wait, sorry, how many months ago?

19:19.486 --> 19:22.487
Oh, just... yea many.

19:23.599 --> 19:25.566
Well, OK. So we're here to tell

19:25.568 --> 19:28.236
Mr. One-night-stand that
you're now a crazy chick

19:28.238 --> 19:30.364
with a bun in the oven?

19:30.367 --> 19:32.807
Officer Haught,

19:32.809 --> 19:35.076
so sweet, so naive.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.978
Ahem! I have no intention

19:36.980 --> 19:38.913
of letting this "pussy
willow" out of the bag.

19:38.915 --> 19:41.137
You're gonna buy him a drink,

19:41.140 --> 19:43.541
and then you're gonna steal
the glass for the saliva sample.

19:43.544 --> 19:45.544
Science will tell us who the dad is,

19:45.547 --> 19:47.846
and then we murder science
to keep its filthy mouth shut,

19:47.849 --> 19:51.182
and hopefully I never have to tell Doc
about this whole unsavoury scenario.

19:52.427 --> 19:54.729
- That actually is a good plan.
- You don't become

19:54.731 --> 19:56.964
Wynonna Earp by confronting
problems head on.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.867
- Hey! Hey! Come on, Frank!
- Oh, hey!

19:59.876 --> 20:01.651
- Ugh!
- Hands off the girls!

20:02.971 --> 20:04.559
His eyes, did you see his eyes?

20:04.562 --> 20:06.341
- Oh, shit! Not now.

20:08.177 --> 20:11.112
- Get him out of here.
- Wynonna...

20:11.114 --> 20:13.681
- you...
- Had sex...

20:13.683 --> 20:16.334
with a revenant.

20:20.645 --> 20:24.019
It's OK. It's OK. Breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.673
- Shit, shit!
- I mean,

20:27.676 --> 20:30.727
you were... you were drunk,
right? So are you sure

20:30.729 --> 20:32.729
you had sex with the...
with the revenant guy?

20:34.532 --> 20:37.067
After I killed the last
of the seven, the...

20:37.069 --> 20:40.070
the Jack of Knives, it destroyed me.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.761
So I dealt with it the best way

20:41.764 --> 20:44.040
I knew how: I binged.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.876
Lord, did I binge!

20:45.878 --> 20:48.245
I just... I was trying
to erase the memories

20:48.247 --> 20:51.081
of being paralyzed,
tortured, nearly eviscerated

20:51.083 --> 20:54.616
by the Revenant Ripper
before I blew his head off.

20:54.619 --> 20:57.087
Most of the night was a blur.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.678
Doc offered to bring me home,

20:58.681 --> 21:01.023
but I wasn't done

21:01.026 --> 21:02.692
so I came here.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.597
It just... I wanted to be touched.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.267
I wanted to feel something

21:10.269 --> 21:11.401
good.

21:13.971 --> 21:16.273
And he was nice. We had fun.

21:17.608 --> 21:21.311
And you now what? It actually helped.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.449
I never thought I'd see him again.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.250
OK, uh,

21:27.252 --> 21:29.786
so... you're the Earp heir,

21:29.788 --> 21:31.755
and he's a revenant, so that means

21:31.757 --> 21:34.891
the baby is... It's uh...

21:34.893 --> 21:37.594
It's Waverly. Oh, boy. I...

21:37.596 --> 21:40.230
Hey, cutie!

21:40.232 --> 21:42.399
Don't "cutie" me.

21:42.401 --> 21:45.101
Hi, sweetie-pie. No, but
seriously, where is she?

21:45.103 --> 21:47.204
Uh... Uh... She's with me,

21:47.206 --> 21:49.873
- and we're... fine.
- I cannot lie to her.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.741
You have to!

21:51.743 --> 21:53.543
- I hear music.
- No.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.645
Trashy. Pumping.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.681
You're at a strip joint!

21:57.683 --> 22:00.083
Aphrodite made me do it!

22:00.085 --> 22:02.018
- Ah!
- Just shut your mouth.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.787
Tell me which one.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.956
- I'm so sorry.
- We're at...

22:08.893 --> 22:10.594
OK, yeah, I guess I deserved that.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.563
Hello?

22:13.565 --> 22:16.500
Oh, you did not just hang up on me.

22:18.887 --> 22:20.804
Next time, this...

22:20.806 --> 22:22.939
means don't tell my sister
we're at a sleazy knocker locker.

22:22.941 --> 22:24.975
Oh. It's Waverly, OK?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.043
You know me, you know how
I am, I can't lie to her.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.405
See? This is what you get when
you're friends with a narc.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.649
I guess I deserved that too.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.353
I did drag you into the shit storm.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.488
And I... I'm gonna

22:38.490 --> 22:41.057
drag you out just as soon
as I get that saliva sample,

22:41.059 --> 22:43.493
but you have got to jet.

22:44.862 --> 22:46.963
- Ready?
- Yeah.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.999
Wynonna?

22:49.001 --> 22:51.868
Woman, how long has it been?

22:53.838 --> 22:57.374
Oh, I'd say... about 28 weeks.

22:58.426 --> 23:00.560
Hey, Doc.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.548
Are we in immediate danger or something?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.983
We are not. I simply aim to never again

23:06.986 --> 23:09.342
- be unprepared for a fight.
- Doc, none of us could

23:09.345 --> 23:11.688
have known that those Widows
spray a paralyzing vapour, OK?

23:11.690 --> 23:14.357
Yeah, I suppose.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.992
Also congratulations, man.

23:17.895 --> 23:21.031
About Wynonna. We both know how I...

23:21.033 --> 23:23.199
Listen. She's carrying a kid,

23:23.201 --> 23:25.535
I wanted to get along and just be

23:25.537 --> 23:27.370
mature about it.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.006
Dolls! Dolls, I got
something on the veil.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.008
I found traces of a powerful

23:32.010 --> 23:34.077
glycosylation toxin.
Could be a major break.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.245
Doc, perfect!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.114
I need two other sets of hands,

23:38.116 --> 23:39.783
and yours are so nimble and soft...

23:39.785 --> 23:42.440
Not now, Jeremy. My hands
are otherwise occupied.

23:43.354 --> 23:46.389
Hey, hey, listen. Look, I
know shit's still happening

23:46.391 --> 23:49.192
right now, but we need
to work together, OK?

23:49.194 --> 23:50.460
Step out of my way.

23:51.617 --> 23:53.976
If I do, you sure as hell
ain't taking our weapons.

23:54.932 --> 23:57.100
- Yeah.
- I just need five minutes.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.602
I'll give you three.

24:01.939 --> 24:03.873
So if you ever find yourselves

24:03.875 --> 24:06.242
building a temporary
shelter in a flood zone,

24:06.244 --> 24:08.345
do not forget to write your name

24:08.347 --> 24:11.019
on the inside of your mosquito helmet.

24:11.022 --> 24:13.617
- Amateur move, Haught.
- I'll drink to that.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.587
Welcome

24:17.589 --> 24:19.574
to the stage,

24:19.577 --> 24:22.592
- Vanessa! Oh, yes!
- Jonas,

24:22.594 --> 24:24.394
this was great,

24:24.396 --> 24:26.630
but you have customers,
we should... we should go.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.698
Are we having a good time?

24:28.700 --> 24:31.134
Yeah, we are, which is why

24:31.136 --> 24:34.137
we're gonna need a few more
of those peppermint shots.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.740
Because it's like drinking Christmas.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.808
- You redheads are wild.
- Yeah.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.443
- I like you.
- Thanks.

24:40.445 --> 24:43.046
You too, Wynonna.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.515
Even if you are here to kill me.

24:46.951 --> 24:49.853
If I distill the toxin
to its essential elements,

24:49.855 --> 24:51.855
I can use them to develop a vaccine

24:51.857 --> 24:54.190
making us impervious
to the Widows' vapour.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.092
You may be a wiz with chemicals,

24:56.094 --> 24:58.128
but temporal measurement
is not your strong suit.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.596
- Five minutes?!
- Hey, you want

24:59.598 --> 25:02.399
that corner-shot
grenade launcher, right?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.268
OK, yeah. Uh, here's
how it's gonna go down.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.537
Doll, you will remove the stopper,

25:07.539 --> 25:10.106
then I will add the
accelerant. And, Doc,

25:10.108 --> 25:13.176
you'll connect the tube to the collection
beaker. We only have a split second

25:13.178 --> 25:16.346
to capture the toxin,
so, uh, we gotta be quick.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.748
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:29.783 --> 25:32.429
Is he praying?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.664
In Icelandic? Ha!

25:34.666 --> 25:36.833
Oh, hold up.

25:39.036 --> 25:42.472
Oh, my God! He's accessing BBD archives.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.506
Hey, stop!

25:44.809 --> 25:47.711
- What are you doing?
- I'm casting a binding spell

25:47.713 --> 25:50.814
so it will lure the Widows to
us and you guys can kill 'em.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.816
Ooh, what?!

25:52.818 --> 25:55.051
- Oh, God!
- What are you...? Idiot!

25:55.053 --> 25:58.154
- Oh!
- What is that smell?

25:58.156 --> 26:00.890
We didn't trap it, we just inhaled it.

26:00.892 --> 26:03.793
A pungent magic show and a
complete waste of my time!

26:11.503 --> 26:13.903
Jeremy,

26:13.905 --> 26:16.406
- what in damnation...
- Hahaha!

26:16.408 --> 26:19.409
Congratulations. Your
binding spell worked.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.479
You bound us all together!

26:22.481 --> 26:24.514
I...

26:24.516 --> 26:26.249
I'm a wizard.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.284
So you knew who I was,

26:28.286 --> 26:30.420
and you had sex with me

26:30.422 --> 26:32.922
- without telling me what you are.
- I don't recall it being

26:32.924 --> 26:35.425
important to you that we tell
each other our life stories

26:35.427 --> 26:38.695
before we bumped nasties.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.930
We just came here for a drink.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.599
Yeah. And to have a few drinks.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.239
- OK, let me do the talking.
- OK.

26:44.242 --> 26:46.903
Baby, you're better at...

26:46.905 --> 26:49.873
Watch your mouth, or the little friend

26:49.875 --> 26:52.876
- in my boot comes out to play.
- Yeah, she means her gun.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.311
And I got one too 'cause I'm a cop.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.180
Ah, nuts!

26:57.182 --> 26:59.315
- I left it at home.
- OK.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.117
Let's not make a scene.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.086
I got a lot of friends here.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.088
If it comes to it,
they'll surround you

27:05.090 --> 27:07.190
before you can even pop off two shots.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.958
He's got a point.

27:11.362 --> 27:13.196
What do you want, "anus"?

27:13.198 --> 27:15.198
I mean, Jonas.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.301
First, I wanna gloat.

27:18.303 --> 27:21.063
And then I wanna ask
you out on a second date.

27:21.066 --> 27:23.273
We could do it out back.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.275
If memory serves,

27:25.277 --> 27:27.076
it only takes ten minutes.

27:27.078 --> 27:30.046
Oof, ten minutes? In your dreams.

27:30.048 --> 27:33.427
Well, milady, you kind
of don't have a choice.

27:35.519 --> 27:38.588
- Tell me you just got fat.
- Don't touch her!

27:38.590 --> 27:40.857
It's right, I keep one in my sock.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.926
How smart am I? I'm...

27:42.928 --> 27:45.057
- I'm smart.
- And word of advice,

27:45.060 --> 27:47.096
it's always lady's choice.

27:51.635 --> 27:55.205
We need an unbinding spell, Jeremy.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.540
- And we need it pronto!
- Come on, you!

27:57.542 --> 28:00.143
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

28:00.145 --> 28:02.912
My quarrel's with Mr. Holliday,

28:02.914 --> 28:04.981
- you can go.
- I wish I could, but, you know,

28:04.983 --> 28:06.316
I can't.

28:11.901 --> 28:14.510
Whatever they are paying
you, I'll pay double.

28:14.512 --> 28:16.445
Justice is my only compensation.

28:16.447 --> 28:19.338
I do hate myself an honourable man.

28:19.341 --> 28:21.250
As I hate myself a hypocrite.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.148
Ow!

28:32.129 --> 28:35.264
- Jeremy!
- That was you!

28:38.835 --> 28:40.069
Go! Go!

28:40.071 --> 28:42.237
Nooo!

28:44.517 --> 28:47.319
- I hate myself a phantom more.
- Phantom?

28:47.322 --> 28:49.945
You're the one who evaporated
into thin air, Holliday.

28:49.947 --> 28:53.048
But... justice delayed

28:53.050 --> 28:54.716
is still justice served.

28:58.108 --> 29:00.823
Nothing from this earthly world can...

29:00.825 --> 29:02.858
- Yeah!
- How did you?

29:02.860 --> 29:04.226
I don't know.

29:04.228 --> 29:06.355
Take my keys, you drive.

29:06.358 --> 29:08.730
Yeah, no kidding. But
you're a cute drunk.

29:08.732 --> 29:10.866
- Good aim too.
- Grabby McRevenant

29:10.868 --> 29:13.268
is not gonna be too happy
about having his thorax crushed,

29:13.270 --> 29:15.055
so we really need to
skip-a-doodle out of here.

29:15.057 --> 29:15.871
Wait, abort, abort!

29:15.873 --> 29:17.272
Sorry.

29:18.708 --> 29:21.210
He knows. Nicole, he knows

29:21.212 --> 29:23.545
that I'm harbouring a fugitive

29:23.547 --> 29:26.835
as in the next heir,
possible rev-Earp hybrid.

29:26.838 --> 29:28.717
What if he tells the rest of them?

29:28.719 --> 29:31.787
They're gonna come for it... and you!

29:32.844 --> 29:34.045
Hey, wait!

29:37.861 --> 29:40.629
- Is that mine?
- Maybe.

29:40.631 --> 29:42.431
It's not supposed to be possible.

29:42.433 --> 29:44.433
Do you know what we've done here?

29:45.802 --> 29:48.570
We've started a new race.

29:48.572 --> 29:50.973
We're the new Adam and Eve.

29:50.975 --> 29:53.609
I see you more as the snake.

29:53.611 --> 29:56.578
You wouldn't.

29:58.081 --> 30:00.682
Come on, no fair! I have "cankles"!

30:02.419 --> 30:04.253
Door prize.

30:04.255 --> 30:06.822
- He's a bad guy, right?
- You are so pretty

30:06.824 --> 30:08.457
and I like you so much!

30:08.459 --> 30:11.360
You are drunk! And in
trouble, OK? Both of you!

30:11.362 --> 30:13.629
I hit three other strip clubs!

30:13.631 --> 30:16.498
Three! Do you know how much
strawberry-scented glitter

30:16.500 --> 30:18.267
I have on me? Huh?

30:18.269 --> 30:21.136
- Hey, you OK?
- No, she's not

30:21.138 --> 30:23.972
because that guy might be the...

30:23.974 --> 30:25.807
with...

30:25.809 --> 30:27.109
Him.

30:28.178 --> 30:29.912
Oh.

30:32.048 --> 30:33.482
So what do we do with him?

30:34.615 --> 30:36.051
Take him for a ride.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.453
So...

30:39.956 --> 30:41.632
tell me what you do to
piss somebody off so bad

30:41.634 --> 30:43.992
- that they're still after you.
- Could be the Pinkertons,

30:43.994 --> 30:46.122
could be Silver Cowboys
Gang, could be Dave!

30:46.125 --> 30:48.730
- So what did you do?
- Poaching, threatening,

30:48.732 --> 30:51.366
stealing from a shipwreck...
Though the messenger

30:51.368 --> 30:53.969
did mention Colorado, 1882.

30:53.971 --> 30:56.838
The right woman, the wrong night. Twice.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.340
This is about a girl?

30:59.987 --> 31:02.511
You're the most selfish guy I know.

31:02.513 --> 31:04.746
You do whatever you
want, whenever you want,

31:04.748 --> 31:06.143
and then when you get in trouble,

31:06.146 --> 31:08.046
you bring everybody down with you.

31:08.049 --> 31:10.219
Oh, I thought we were gonna
be mature about things.

31:10.221 --> 31:12.487
I was leaving to face
my demons on my own,

31:12.489 --> 31:14.690
which is how I work best.

31:14.692 --> 31:16.825
Wynonna, that baby,

31:16.827 --> 31:19.027
they need you, so this
whole lone-wolf shit

31:19.029 --> 31:21.063
that you're doing,
it ain't gonna cut it.

31:21.065 --> 31:24.066
'Cause guess what, Doc,
you're gonna be a daddy.

31:28.205 --> 31:30.305
Well, it is quite possible

31:30.307 --> 31:33.308
that I ain't. I reckon

31:33.310 --> 31:35.177
that should put your mind at ease.

31:35.179 --> 31:38.413
Huzzah! OK, yes, it says the hocus pocus

31:38.415 --> 31:40.488
should wear off after one rotation.

31:40.491 --> 31:43.684
- So like what? A day?
- Or, uh, a year.

31:43.687 --> 31:45.420
What?

31:45.422 --> 31:47.089
Gentlemen,

31:47.091 --> 31:48.690
I do believe

31:48.692 --> 31:50.559
we have some unfinished
business to attend.

31:50.561 --> 31:53.862
Ghost. Yeah, we are
being attacked by a ghost.

31:53.864 --> 31:56.798
Who you gonna call? No
one. There's no one to call!

31:56.800 --> 31:58.100
Sir.

32:02.038 --> 32:04.906
- Recompense is a-coming.
- OK, yes, see you.

32:04.908 --> 32:08.043
- Jeremy, you're making this worse!
- Nothing could make this worse!

32:08.045 --> 32:11.280
Jeremy, stop!

32:13.689 --> 32:16.191
Ohhh, it's a whole ghost cavalry.

32:16.194 --> 32:18.954
Well, shit! Things just got worse.

32:28.141 --> 32:29.841
Don't even think about it.

32:36.015 --> 32:37.742
That is a Colt Lightning.

32:37.745 --> 32:39.817
Your personal effects will
be given to your next of kin.

32:39.819 --> 32:41.653
Wonderful.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.655
You served under the great Wyatt Earp...

32:45.024 --> 32:46.724
yet a criminal.

32:46.726 --> 32:48.059
A waste.

32:48.061 --> 32:50.228
Let me out!

32:50.230 --> 32:51.657
Hey!

32:51.660 --> 32:53.698
Oh, God, I think I just had a hangover.

32:55.901 --> 32:58.903
Haven't been this close
to a revenant in a while.

32:58.905 --> 33:01.239
I mean, you know, not that I know of.

33:01.241 --> 33:03.374
- It's not always obvious.
- Clearly.

33:03.376 --> 33:05.243
OK, what-what if the baby's not his?

33:05.245 --> 33:07.612
It doesn't matter,
he knows I'm pregnant.

33:07.614 --> 33:09.280
We let him go, they all know.

33:09.282 --> 33:11.597
OK, so we hold him somewhere.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.285
- Yeah. Say, Hell?
- What, execute him?

33:14.287 --> 33:15.920
It's what she does, Nicole.

33:15.922 --> 33:18.589
It could be there's another way.

33:18.591 --> 33:22.226
Don't know what it is though.

33:24.563 --> 33:26.364
He might.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.568
I-I got us stuck,

33:30.570 --> 33:33.104
I ran like a coward,
this is all my fault.

33:34.173 --> 33:36.240
Don't forget, I fornicated

33:36.242 --> 33:38.309
with the judge's wife twice.

33:38.311 --> 33:40.244
Oh, God, you even
screw up cooler than me.

33:40.246 --> 33:43.047
- What now?
- Well, I guess

33:43.049 --> 33:45.383
- a firing squad.
- Yeah, and our only

33:45.385 --> 33:46.651
weapons are our words.

33:47.953 --> 33:50.955
Look, you said yourself
your quarrel is with me.

33:50.957 --> 33:52.957
Let them go.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.959
In harbouring a fugitive,
they made themselves

33:54.961 --> 33:57.829
accomplices... and shall be punished

33:57.831 --> 33:59.831
as such.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.866
You are victims of my mistakes,

34:01.868 --> 34:03.885
and for that, I am
truly sorry, gentlemen,

34:03.888 --> 34:06.204
but I'm not going down without a fight.

34:07.439 --> 34:08.773
So ready yourselves.

34:10.208 --> 34:13.411
John Henry Holliday,

34:13.413 --> 34:15.679
you've received a sentence of death

34:15.681 --> 34:18.516
for seduction with intent to fornicate

34:18.518 --> 34:21.518
with the wife of the honourable Justice

34:21.521 --> 34:24.621
Stanley Parker... twice.

34:26.425 --> 34:27.958
Doc Holliday...

34:29.328 --> 34:32.463
is a class-A pain in the ass...

34:34.299 --> 34:36.801
but he's also one of the most loyal

34:36.803 --> 34:38.902
and solid and fearless
man I've ever met.

34:38.905 --> 34:41.817
Yeah, he can be a polecat sometimes,

34:41.820 --> 34:44.909
but he's a changed man.
He's redeemed himself

34:44.911 --> 34:47.445
many times over. And I'm proud to call

34:47.447 --> 34:49.679
this man my brother.

34:49.681 --> 34:51.649
Son of a bitch!

34:51.650 --> 34:53.217
Uh, it was... it was a great speech.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.554
No, they branded me.

34:57.923 --> 35:00.258
The five circles, each indicate a point

35:00.260 --> 35:01.726
on the five-sided star.

35:01.728 --> 35:04.028
The U.S. Marshals' badge.

35:05.798 --> 35:09.067
- You are all unusually close.
- Yeah,

35:09.069 --> 35:10.535
I know.

35:11.503 --> 35:14.238
- Reeves?
- Yes?

35:14.240 --> 35:16.707
- Now, as I was saying...
- Bass Reeves!

35:18.177 --> 35:20.011
- Do I know you?
- You're a legend!

35:20.013 --> 35:22.513
- You're the reason why I wanted to be a lawman!
- Lovely.

35:23.615 --> 35:27.251
Now, any last words?

35:27.253 --> 35:29.720
I got three! Justice...

35:32.224 --> 35:33.291
integrity...

35:35.527 --> 35:37.562
and service.

35:37.564 --> 35:40.631
- That's our motto.
- Yeah. Mine too.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.039
- Going to my pocket.
- Slowly.

35:54.246 --> 35:56.981
I'm a supervisory deputy
marshal, and I have several

35:56.983 --> 36:00.451
deputies under my command.

36:02.454 --> 36:05.857
You outrank me. Yeah, boys,

36:05.859 --> 36:08.392
he is who he says he is.

36:08.394 --> 36:09.607
Sir!

36:11.130 --> 36:12.130
Sir.

36:15.100 --> 36:18.102
Doc Holliday is under my
jurisdiction, gentlemen,

36:18.104 --> 36:20.905
and, uh,

36:20.907 --> 36:23.908
you are relieved of your
duties in this particular case.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.910
As you wish, Deputy Marshal.

36:27.246 --> 36:28.779
As for Doc Holliday...

36:31.650 --> 36:33.251
Thank you.

36:35.921 --> 36:38.122
Doc Holliday, you...

36:40.325 --> 36:42.026
- are pardoned.
- Alright, boys,

36:42.028 --> 36:44.638
that means we can get
some rest. Give him back

36:44.641 --> 36:46.931
- the weapons. I'm tired.
- That's right.

36:46.933 --> 36:49.167
I'm so tired.

36:57.443 --> 36:58.843
- Whoo!
- Yes!

36:58.845 --> 37:00.578
That was... that was Bass Reeves, man!

37:00.580 --> 37:02.513
What? The guy's a legend.

37:02.515 --> 37:04.382
So,

37:04.384 --> 37:06.150
you mean any of those things you said?

37:07.915 --> 37:10.884
Nah. It was just to buy time.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.794
You do.

37:16.796 --> 37:19.410
What makes you think

37:19.413 --> 37:22.266
- this kid could be yours?
- A revenant breeding

37:22.268 --> 37:24.202
with a human? Unlikely, yeah,

37:24.204 --> 37:27.071
but rumour is it's happened before.

37:27.073 --> 37:28.873
That's the problem with rumours:

37:28.875 --> 37:30.608
people tend to believe them.

37:30.610 --> 37:32.843
This is history. I'm gonna go down

37:32.845 --> 37:35.446
as the revenant that got the heir...

37:36.615 --> 37:39.350
- preggers.
- Not if we don't tell anyone.

37:42.421 --> 37:44.555
I remember that night.

37:44.557 --> 37:47.825
You stumbling in all doe-eyed drunk,

37:47.827 --> 37:50.528
working those West-coast
hips to a little Lana...

37:53.475 --> 37:55.700
teasing out lap dances for free.

37:55.702 --> 37:57.435
- Stop it!
- The place was crawling

37:57.437 --> 38:00.538
with revenants, and here you were

38:00.540 --> 38:02.039
performing for them all.

38:03.408 --> 38:06.043
Of course, I was the only one
that knew you were the heir.

38:07.312 --> 38:09.547
I admit I was hoping

38:09.549 --> 38:11.749
you'd be a bit more of a challenge.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.651
I always heard you had a mouth on you.

38:15.995 --> 38:17.612
And you do.

38:17.615 --> 38:20.516
Hmm, baby,

38:20.519 --> 38:22.727
one smile from me,

38:22.729 --> 38:24.729
and those legs

38:24.731 --> 38:26.564
- popped right open.
- Shut

38:26.566 --> 38:29.433
- your stupid, sexist pie hole!
- I believe we were talking

38:29.435 --> 38:31.202
- about her pie hole.
- Enough.

38:34.539 --> 38:36.540
You see, we always thought the best way

38:36.542 --> 38:38.376
to defeat the heir was to kill her,

38:38.378 --> 38:41.279
Lucky for us, she's a whore

38:41.281 --> 38:42.803
who defeated herself

38:42.806 --> 38:44.872
by letting one of us get inside of her.

38:46.253 --> 38:49.155
Must be frustrating for you

38:49.157 --> 38:51.157
how much the world is changed.

38:51.159 --> 38:54.093
- I'm your kid's father.
- You're a boring cliché.

38:59.633 --> 39:01.700
I'm gonna raise this kid

39:01.702 --> 39:03.802
to be good

39:03.804 --> 39:06.272
and strong,

39:06.274 --> 39:08.841
and everything you're not.

39:08.843 --> 39:11.801
You know, an Earp.

39:13.647 --> 39:15.814
I'd say, "and don't you forget it," but

39:15.816 --> 39:17.816
you ain't got that kind of time.

39:30.831 --> 39:32.264
Here's to single motherhood.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.702
You're a superhero.

39:36.704 --> 39:38.604
Same damn thing.

39:43.410 --> 39:44.610
- Wynonna...
- Hmm?

39:46.813 --> 39:50.015
This baby, what is it?

39:54.854 --> 39:56.021
Ours.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.907
- Is it gonna leave a mark?
- Nah, it's superficial.

40:07.910 --> 40:10.155
- You had no plan out there, huh?
- Oh, I still had time.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.960
They hadn't cocked their
guns yet. Why? Did you?

40:11.962 --> 40:14.295
Old 45s can't pierce body armour.

40:14.297 --> 40:16.164
Thought it'd absorb a few hits,

40:16.166 --> 40:18.099
then take 'em out while they reloaded.

40:18.101 --> 40:19.826
Body armour, and you
couldn't have shared?

40:19.829 --> 40:21.870
Particularly as only you could
touch them for some reason.

40:21.872 --> 40:24.038
Yeah, we share a likeness.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.708
We're both marshals. Boom.

40:26.710 --> 40:28.777
I've oft brought calamity onto others,

40:28.779 --> 40:30.845
on that you are correct, but believe me,

40:30.847 --> 40:33.210
I do not always get what I want!

40:33.213 --> 40:34.913
Well, you are the father.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.750
Because we need you to be a father.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.724
Those marshals found
you after all this time,

40:42.726 --> 40:44.659
what do you think has changed?

40:44.661 --> 40:47.295
I was at the bottom of
a well for a long time,

40:47.297 --> 40:49.431
but now, uh,

40:49.433 --> 40:51.299
there is someone I need to visit.

40:53.769 --> 40:55.904
How long until this bond wears off?

40:55.906 --> 40:57.739
I think it already has.

40:57.741 --> 41:00.208
And Jeremy, he's no wizard.

41:00.210 --> 41:02.877
Shhh!

41:04.246 --> 41:05.547
Here, man.

41:07.149 --> 41:09.350
I suppose I could linger.

41:09.352 --> 41:11.352
She's not going anywhere.

41:14.590 --> 41:16.183
I have an ultrasound

41:16.186 --> 41:19.187
booked next week,

41:19.190 --> 41:22.363
but if my OBGYN is expecting samples,

41:22.365 --> 41:24.933
tough luck, she ain't getting any. Ha!

41:26.435 --> 41:29.128
I already know the pre-existing
conditions on the one hand,

41:29.172 --> 41:31.005
revenant-it is,

41:31.007 --> 41:33.708
on the other,

41:33.710 --> 41:35.710
Wyatt Earp's best friend.

41:37.613 --> 41:40.114
Fakakte.

41:40.116 --> 41:41.516
I'm sorry.

41:42.852 --> 41:44.486
I kind of talked to Doc.

41:44.488 --> 41:46.921
Waverly, what?

41:46.923 --> 41:50.325
I... I was trying to
be supportive, you know.

41:52.027 --> 41:54.389
I thought you told him.
- No. Chickened out.

41:55.397 --> 41:58.366
Then I chickened out about
telling you I chickened out, so...

41:59.735 --> 42:02.737
Whoops. Look,

42:02.739 --> 42:04.706
whoever the dad is, all that matters

42:04.708 --> 42:06.007
is that this baby...

42:09.144 --> 42:12.380
There I said it, baby.

42:12.382 --> 42:14.482
Still weird.

42:14.484 --> 42:16.985
It's an Earp.

42:16.987 --> 42:18.520
As Earp as you and me.

42:20.523 --> 42:23.219
Hey, you're Auntie Waverly.

42:23.222 --> 42:24.855
Yay!

42:24.858 --> 42:26.761
You need to teach
this thing its history.

42:29.723 --> 42:32.433
Hey, what's going on?

42:37.924 --> 42:39.024
Wave.

42:41.443 --> 42:42.977
What about my history?

42:44.647 --> 42:46.114
Waverly.

42:47.237 --> 42:49.171
I don't think I'm your sister...

42:51.520 --> 42:53.087
or even an Earp at all.

42:55.091 --> 42:57.191
What?
