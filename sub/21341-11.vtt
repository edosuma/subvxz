Hey, T-Rex, Quetzalcoatlus
and Triceratops

01:07.801 --> 01:09.237
instead of just
standing there

01:09.270 --> 01:11.239
do you want to help me
dig for fossils?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.840
[squawks]

01:14.442 --> 01:16.110
Guess not.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.150
What are you doing?

01:22.183 --> 01:24.452
Saara, I'm so glad
you're here to see this.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.155
I think I've just made
a major discovery.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.656
Wait,
is that a tooth?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.458
And what are you
doing now?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.460
Paleontologists wrap
the bones they find

01:32.493 --> 01:34.428
in plaster so they
don't get broken.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.365
I don't have plaster
so I used plasticine.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.567
Now we get to take
it to the museum

01:39.600 --> 01:41.735
for fossil day
and get it examined.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.372
Oh, listen.
About the museum.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.607
Don't say you
can't take me.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.875
I can't take you.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.643
I just told you
not to say that.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.446
I'm sorry, Dana,
but I've got homework.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.183
Maybe someone else
can take you.

Hey, Mr. Hendrickson.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.608
Dana here.
I need to ask you a huge favor.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.576
It's fossil day
at the museum.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.545
That's where you can bring
in fossils you've found

02:24.578 --> 02:27.248
and the museum experts
help discover what they are.

Sorry, got cut off there.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.293
Anyway, I've been looking

02:39.327 --> 02:41.829
Sorry again about
digging in your garden.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.931
And my sister
was going to take me

02:43.964 --> 02:44.898
but she has homework.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.867
I asked my mom
but she's on call

02:46.900 --> 02:48.336
and my dad's at work

02:48.369 --> 02:50.271
so I thought if you're
weren't busy

02:50.304 --> 02:51.405
maybe you could...

02:51.439 --> 02:52.606
[machine beeps]

02:52.640 --> 02:54.708
[knock on door]

02:56.577 --> 02:58.379
I thought maybe
you could take me,

02:58.412 --> 03:00.248
Mr. Hendrickson.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.715
I know you're in there.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.785
I can hear your chair
from downstairs.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.855
Mr. Hendrickson!

03:09.757 --> 03:11.825
I made you
a fossil toolbelt too.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.228
Just in case we have to do
some work on our specimen.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.597
I guess
I'll get my keys.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.770
This is a very
nice example

03:22.803 --> 03:24.672
of a trilobite, Tristan.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.708
Do you have any idea
how old this might be?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.610
I would estimate

03:29.643 --> 03:31.945
400 million years old.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.847
Oh, hi, Dana.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.349
Greetings, Dr. Seymour.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.318
This is my field assistant,
Mr. Hendrickson.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.653
Have you got any new
discoveries for us?

03:39.687 --> 03:42.390
Yes.
Field assistant.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.392
I'll unwrap it for you.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.660
I found it
in my back yard.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.432
Interesting.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.401
It appears you have
some kind of a tooth.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.968
I could have
told you that.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.838
I was thinking
that too.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.707
Possibly from a T-Rex,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.743
Quetzalcoatlus
or a triceratops.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.845
Well, it's probably
not that old

04:04.878 --> 04:06.380
but it certainly
has a resemblance

04:06.414 --> 04:08.382
to one of those
prehistoric creatures.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.550
Well, which one?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.485
Shh, Mr. Hendrickson.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.053
Well, which one?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.623
Sounds like a dino
experiment to me.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.958
Fortunately, here at the ROM
was have cast replicas

04:17.991 --> 04:19.893
of all three
of those animals

04:19.927 --> 04:22.463
so all you have to do
is find them and compare.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.765
I won't let you down,
Dr. Seymour.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.834
Good.
You can count on me.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.870
Great.
I promise to...

04:29.903 --> 04:32.540
Where's that Quet
whats-a-ma-call-it thing?

04:32.573 --> 04:37.545
[***]

04:37.578 --> 04:40.581
[***]

04:40.614 --> 04:42.983
Ah, well he said
it was in the lobby

04:43.016 --> 04:44.785
but I don't
see it anywhere.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.020
It's not this one, is it?

04:48.722 --> 04:51.525
No, that's
the futalognkosaurus.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.761
One of the biggest
dinosaurs of all time.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.828
Ah.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.466
So, what kind of
dinosaur is the...

04:58.499 --> 05:00.934
quetzo... coalus.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.403
[laughs]

05:02.436 --> 05:04.538
Quetzalcoatlus
and it's not a dinosaur.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.341
It's a prehistoric
winged reptile.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.411
Does that mean it can fly
because it's got wings?

05:10.444 --> 05:11.445
Exactly.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.481
Then maybe we should
be looking up.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.420
[***]

05:19.453 --> 05:21.455
[Mr. Hendrickson]
Ah, that's a biggy.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.924
Biggest flying
creature ever.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.727
Good find, field assistant.
Let's get going now.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.128
I'm going to
hang out down here

05:28.161 --> 05:30.664
because it's a bit more
quiet and peaceful.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.032
Understood,
I'll be right back

05:32.065 --> 05:34.001
with more information
about our discovery.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.703
Isn't this fun?

05:42.710 --> 05:47.681

05:47.715 --> 05:52.686
[***]

05:52.720 --> 05:57.691
[***]

05:57.725 --> 06:00.761
Does this tooth belong to you,
Quetzalcoatlus?

06:02.930 --> 06:04.598
Wait a minute.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.934
Your beak doesn't have
any teeth in it at all.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.869
How is that possible?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.505
[squawks]

06:11.539 --> 06:13.807
Quetzalcoatlus.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.975
That's it.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.878
Some paleontologists think
that you either grabbed fish

06:17.911 --> 06:20.514
or scavenged food
and swallowed it hole.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.550
Either way,
you wouldn't need teeth,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.585
meaning this tooth does
not belong to you.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.119
I've got to tell
Mr. Hendrickson.

06:26.153 --> 06:30.190
[squawks]

06:30.223 --> 06:35.195
[***]

06:35.228 --> 06:40.200
[***]

06:40.233 --> 06:44.972

06:45.005 --> 06:46.574
[Dana]
Field assistant.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.841
Field assistant.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.843
The Quetzalcoatlus
didn't have teeth.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.012
They didn't need them to eat
which means the tooth

06:52.045 --> 06:55.616
must belong to either
the triceratops or the T-Rex.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.084
Come on. Let's go.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.820
I'm going to linger
here for a moment.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.791
Are you okay?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.193
You look sad, or angry.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.529
It's hard to tell
with your face.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.163
[laughs]

07:10.197 --> 07:12.165
I'm fine. You go.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.868
I'll wait here for
your next discovery.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.785

07:31.819 --> 07:33.821
Does this tooth
belong to you, T-Rex?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.458
Nope.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.861
The T-Rex tooth
is way sharper than mine.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.598
[roars]

07:50.604 --> 07:52.640
Hey, T-Rex.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.275
[growls]

07:55.308 --> 07:57.010
Yeah, I know.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.547
You use your sharp teeth
to chomp into other dinosaurs.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.682
You wouldn't need a flat
tooth like this one

08:01.715 --> 08:03.250
because this one
would be better for...

08:04.952 --> 08:06.887
Dinosaurs that
chop up plants

08:06.920 --> 08:09.056
like the triceratops.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.257
Mystery solved.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.626
I can't wait to tell
Mr. Hendrickson.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.895
Bye, Triceratops.
Bye, T-Rex.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.165
[both roaring]

08:20.568 --> 08:21.935
Tooth mystery solved.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.804
The tooth is too flat
to tear meat

08:23.837 --> 08:25.773
so no good for a carnivore
like the T-Rex

08:25.806 --> 08:27.908
but it's perfect
for a herbivore

08:27.941 --> 08:29.543
like the triceratops.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.944
We did it,
field assistant.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.849
[sighs]

08:35.883 --> 08:37.150
Mr. Hendrickson.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.687
Are you so happy
you're crying?

08:42.055 --> 08:44.592
I sometimes cry when
I think about dinosaurs.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.795
I thought you
loved dinosaurs.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.663
That's just it.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.231
I love them so much

08:51.264 --> 08:54.134
but they're
all gone now.

08:54.167 --> 08:58.271
That's why I look for things
to remind me of them.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.774
That way they're never
really gone forever

09:00.808 --> 09:03.577
because I'll
remember them.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.614
Here, Mr. Hendrickson.
You keep the tooth.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
That way you'll
remember me.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.017
[chuckles]

09:12.319 --> 09:13.854
Thank you.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.322
You're welcome,

09:15.355 --> 09:18.826
but do you think
I could borrow it for a bit?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.929
I mean I've never found
a dinosaur tooth before.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.733
Do you want a photo?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.668
Absolutely.

Say dino experiment

I need my field

11:54.181 --> 11:56.416

11:58.118 --> 12:01.321
Dana, there's a compsognaythusy
under your bed.

What? Where?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.394
Dad.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.497
And it's pronounced
Com-sog-na-thus, Dad.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.900
Of course.
Come on.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.035
Time to get ready for school.
Sara's already left.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.171
Dad, do you think I could
sleep for five more minutes?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.507
I was dreaming
I was Barnum Brown.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.075
Barnum Brown?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.476
Oh, Dad.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.512
I have so much to teach
you about dinosaurs.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.380
Barnum Brown was
a type of dinosaur?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.983
Barnum Brown was
the chief fossil hunter

12:30.017 --> 12:32.953
for the American Museum
of Natural History.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.257
This building,
right here.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.159
Barnum discovered
a ton of dinosaurs.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.329
He even discovered
one of my favorites.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.464
The Corythosaurus.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.166
It looks like it
has a duck mouth.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.968
Exactly.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.970
Barnum found it
in 1911.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.339
That's over
100 years ago.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.407
Its name also means
helmet lizard

12:54.441 --> 12:57.310
because it had this cool crest
at the top of it's head

12:57.344 --> 13:00.147
that paleontologists think
could make really loud noises.

13:02.115 --> 13:06.053
[groans]

13:08.488 --> 13:10.123
What's with
the fur coat?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.491
Oh, that.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.360
Every time Barnum found
a new dinosaur bone,

13:13.393 --> 13:16.229
he'd always want his picture
to have him in a big fur coat.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.198
Well, I guess it does
make him stand out.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.833
When was this taken?

13:19.867 --> 13:21.334
About 100 years ago.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.970
He was also a spy,

13:23.003 --> 13:25.405
or at least
he said he was.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.208
Fossil hunter by day,
spy by night.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.943
I like this guy.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.478
Guess how he found
dinosaur bones.

13:31.511 --> 13:35.248
Using super secret
spy gadgets?

13:35.282 --> 13:37.885
Laser pen?
Pew, pew.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.153
Well, if you call dynamite
a gadget, then yes.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.554
Dynamite?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.190
He'd blow up
mountain sides

13:43.223 --> 13:45.492
and look through
the blown-up bits for bones.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.627
If I could have just five
more minutes of sleeping,

13:47.660 --> 13:50.130
I might find some
dinosaur bones.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.165
[whimpers]

13:52.199 --> 13:54.968
Ah?

13:55.002 --> 13:57.938
[whimpers]

13:57.971 --> 13:59.172
Fine.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.074
Five more minutes
and then up.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.076
No arguments.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.612
Costa... toosie...
promise.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.647
Compsognathus?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.350
And it had
three claws,

14:10.383 --> 14:12.152
but yes.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.420
Thanks, Dad.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.957
[sighs]

14:20.027 --> 14:23.230
[chirping]

14:23.263 --> 14:28.235
[***]

14:28.268 --> 14:33.240
[***]

14:33.273 --> 14:34.674
[***]

14:34.707 --> 14:36.543
Remember, boys.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.912
We're digging for
dinosaur bone fossils.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.613
They should be
a slightly darker co lour

14:40.647 --> 14:42.950
than the rocks around.

14:42.983 --> 14:47.955
[***]

14:47.988 --> 14:49.656
I found something!

14:51.124 --> 14:53.093
Chisel.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.361
Hammer.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.436
Horse hair brush.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.477
Blow.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.016
This tooth is almost
as big as my hand.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.218
I've never seen
a tooth this big.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.621
I think we just found
ourselves a new dinosaur.

15:21.654 --> 15:26.326
[applause]

15:26.359 --> 15:31.331
[***]

15:31.364 --> 15:36.336
[***]

15:36.369 --> 15:41.341
[***]

15:41.374 --> 15:45.245
[***]

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
Dad!

15:46.646 --> 15:49.182
You won't believe
what I just found.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.583
[Dad]
Did you change?

15:50.617 --> 15:51.951
No.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.291
[Dana]
Dad!

15:58.325 --> 16:00.660
You won't believe
what I found.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.129
Did you brush
your teeth?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.530
No...

16:08.068 --> 16:09.702
Can you come talk to me
while I do?

16:18.411 --> 16:21.381
[mumbles]

16:21.414 --> 16:24.517
Say again?

16:24.551 --> 16:27.720
The first tyrannosaurus
rex bone.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.422
Barnum Brown
found that?

16:29.456 --> 16:33.160
Uh huh, the T-Rex was
his most famous discovery.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.262
So, why did he name it
the Tyrannosaurus Rex?

16:35.295 --> 16:38.165
[snorts]

16:42.069 --> 16:43.536
[mumbles]

16:43.570 --> 16:45.572
[spits]

16:45.605 --> 16:46.739
He didn't.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.110
The Tyrannosaurus Rex was
first named Manospondylus Gigas.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.178
What?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.746
Manospondylus Gigas
doesn't even sound as good.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.283
Henry Fairfield Osborn
thought the same thing.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.418
Who's that?
Barnum Brown's boss.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
He was the president of
the American Museum

17:00.453 --> 17:01.621
of Natural History.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.256
Can you imagine, Dad?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.624
Coming up with the name

17:04.657 --> 17:07.627
of the most famous
dinosaur of all time?

17:07.660 --> 17:10.763
I wish I could have
been him at the time.

17:10.797 --> 17:15.735
[***]

17:18.705 --> 17:20.307
Mr. Barnum Brown,

17:20.340 --> 17:22.509
I understand some
congratulations are in order

17:22.542 --> 17:25.345
for your latest dinosaur
fossil discovery.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.413
Yes, thank you.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.348
Construction on the skeleton
is almost complete.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.083
It is a most
terrific sight.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.252
From the size of the tooth
that I discovered

17:32.285 --> 17:34.254
I deduced that it was
the largest carnivore

17:34.287 --> 17:35.422
of all time.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.656
Have you
determined a name?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.158
I have indeed.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.194
I have named it
Manospondylus Gigas.

17:41.228 --> 17:45.165
Which means giant
porous vertebra.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.167
Um, no.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.270
Well, as the person who
discovered the fossil,

17:50.303 --> 17:52.272
I believe that the naming
rights should be mine,

17:52.305 --> 17:54.374
as is customary.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.477
Well, as the person
who funded the expedition

17:57.510 --> 18:00.547
as well as your
previous expeditions

18:00.580 --> 18:03.550
and maybe your
future expeditions,

18:03.583 --> 18:06.453
I believe I should
have naming rights.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.455
Unless you'd like
to blow up mountains

18:08.488 --> 18:10.390
with your own money.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.226
You make a very good point,
Mr. Henry Fairfield Osborn.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.164
Tell me, what names
did you have in mind?

18:17.197 --> 18:20.667
Well, it is clearly one
of the kings of the dinosaurs.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.669
Therefore,
its name should be

18:22.702 --> 18:24.737
something grand
and fierce

18:24.771 --> 18:26.806
yet still remind
the audience

18:26.839 --> 18:28.241
that it's a reptile.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.712
Think, Henry, think.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.714
I've got it.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.350
Uh, fierce reptile king.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.219
No, that's not right.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.753
But I do like
the King part.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.655
How about

18:42.689 --> 18:44.591
Grand Lizard King?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.530
No. No.
I wanted to like it but no.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.731
I have to agree.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.466
Oh, why is
this creature

18:53.500 --> 18:55.202
such a difficult
to name tyrant?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.903
[bell dings]

18:56.936 --> 18:58.205
[both gasp]

18:58.238 --> 19:00.607
Much obliged.
Thank you.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.176
That's it.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.412
Tyrano which
is Greek for Tyrant.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.614
Saurus which is
Greek for lizard

19:07.647 --> 19:10.317
and rex which is
Latin for king.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.886
I give you
the Rexsaurs Tyrano.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.791
Eh.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.327
I give you

19:20.360 --> 19:23.196
the Tyrannosaurs Rex.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.164
Now you've got it.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.903
King of
the dinosaurs.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.440
Dana.
A little more quiet?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.442
The neighbors
will hear you upstairs.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.577
Well, Henry was excited
because he knew

19:37.610 --> 19:39.479
this dinosaur would
bring in the crowds.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.514
What do you mean
"bring in the crowds?"

19:41.548 --> 19:44.317
Everyone wanted to see
the next big dinosaur,

19:44.351 --> 19:45.952
so they all raced
to the museum

19:45.985 --> 19:47.854
whenever a new one
was discovered.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.490
The T-Rex was
first named in 1905

19:50.523 --> 19:52.925
and people still
want to see it.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.395
So, which kind of dinosaur
do you want to be today?

19:55.428 --> 19:58.465
[roars]

20:03.336 --> 20:04.904
[both]
T-Rex.

20:06.306 --> 20:11.244
[growls]

20:15.782 --> 20:18.285
When I grow up I want to
be a chief fossil hunter

20:18.318 --> 20:19.686
just like Barnum Brown.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.354
Not a spy too?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.256
Fossil hunters are
kind of like spies.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.658
They sneak into rocks
to uncover secrets.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.627
Huh, never thought
of it like that.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.262
Good point.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.731
Dad, do you think I'll
ever discover a dinosaur

20:31.764 --> 20:33.366
and get to name it?

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
I'm sure you will, nugget.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.007
[roars]

20:41.040 --> 20:43.510
[***]
