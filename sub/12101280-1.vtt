WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:13.179
[dramatic music playing]

00:27.360 --> 00:30.071
[Alina] When I was young,
I was afraid of the dark.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.240
[thunder rumbling]

00:32.323 --> 00:35.785
When I got older,
I learned that darkness is a place,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.329
-and it's full of monsters.
-[growling]

00:41.166 --> 00:45.003
I live in East Ravka,
but I've never been welcome here

00:45.086 --> 00:48.757
because I look like my mother,
and she looked like the enemy.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.383
Alina, how can you do that in here?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.552
Bumps help with texture.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.387
The Fold looks different on mine.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.473
I need to get
a better view from your country.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.641
[man 1] She grew up here. Come on!

00:58.725 --> 01:00.477
[man 2] The Shu Han
didn't want her either.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.687
Cartographers, listen up.
We're almost there.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.314
Pack up and be ready to leave.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.901
And if you lose anything,
you will not be getting a replacement.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.406
[Alina] But they aren't the monsters.
They're just boys.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.492
[growling in distance]

01:16.534 --> 01:17.869
[horse whinnies]

01:24.209 --> 01:26.753
I learned about
my true enemy when I was a child.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.589
[young Alina] Is it real?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.634
Of course it's real.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.470
The Fold ate your parents.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.309
It's the reason
for many of the orphans here.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.938
People trying to cross.
Taunting the Saints.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.942
Then why cross it? Why not go around?

01:49.025 --> 01:50.193
Read the map.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.821
The north want our Grisha dead,

01:53.571 --> 01:55.406
the south guards its mountains.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.242
We have nowhere else to go.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.287
Now work on your shading, girl.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.873
Keep a pencil in your hand.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.334
Or else someone
will put a rifle in it instead.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.047
[Alina] I spent years
thinking I'd find a way out.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.093
Around the Fold, to go somewhere
where no one cares where I'm from.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.054
-[thunder rumbling]
-[horse whinnies]

02:18.138 --> 02:22.725
But now, I'm old enough
to know the only way out is through.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.644
[growling in distance]

02:28.648 --> 02:32.944
We are never going to see it go away.
This abomination is here forever.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.195
You don't go to church.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.739
A Saint
who can summon the sun will destroy it.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.451
I'd like to see even one person
who isn't scared of that.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.661
[woman] I bet I know someone.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.039
Mal. He isn't afraid of anything.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.750
[chuckling]

02:50.003 --> 02:51.713
[sighs] You'd be surprised.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.219
[softly] Alina.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.263
Mal?

03:00.805 --> 03:02.015
Look what I found.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.435
-Where?
-[young Mal] Little guy's lost.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.605
But I found some chewed plants
in the woods to the east.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.148
I bet his warren's there.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.318
Why you run from me, half-breed?

03:13.401 --> 03:14.819
Stay away from him.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.488
Or what? You going to draw me, rice eater?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.117
Or I'll cut you.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.827
-[footsteps approaching]
-What's this?

03:24.078 --> 03:27.957
Who's tracked in dirt on my rug?
Mal Oretsev!

03:30.960 --> 03:31.878
Mal?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.133
I know you're hiding here!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.761
-Come out now!
-No!

03:41.638 --> 03:43.223
Can't hide forever.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.432
Yes, I can!

03:45.058 --> 03:46.851
All right, maybe you can.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.647
But this is what you become!

03:50.730 --> 03:53.024
A boy who hides from a fight!

03:53.608 --> 03:57.570
Get very good at it,
maybe you'll survive to see 20.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.200
Bring me a big rabbit
before the dinner bell goes.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.285
[panting]

04:11.584 --> 04:13.503
[people cheering in distance]

04:18.132 --> 04:20.468
[bell ringing]

04:40.113 --> 04:41.739
[crowd cheering]

04:41.823 --> 04:44.784
Final bets! Final bets!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.954
Keep it clean, boys, go on.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.038
[man 1] Yes!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.124
[indistinct yelling]

04:51.207 --> 04:53.876
[man 2] Get stuck in there.
Let's go! Come on!

04:56.379 --> 05:00.341
It's all right, breathe.
Breathe, here we go. Come on.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.426
He'll be all right?

05:01.509 --> 05:04.137
I'm sure we'll find out.
Come on, hit him! Belt him.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.431
[crowd clamoring]

05:06.514 --> 05:09.684
He doesn't want it!
Come on, chump! He doesn't want it!

05:09.767 --> 05:11.436
[man 3] Hurt him, now! Hurt him!

05:11.519 --> 05:12.520
[both grunting]

05:12.603 --> 05:14.647
[cheering]

05:17.483 --> 05:20.653
[man 3] Come on, let's go!
Let's go now! Let's have it. Come on!

05:25.366 --> 05:26.743
Lovely!

05:26.826 --> 05:28.953
Yes! Yes!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.122
You beauty!

05:31.998 --> 05:35.877
My boy, Mal Oretsev, wins again!
Who wants a go?

05:38.796 --> 05:39.881
[man 4] I'll take a turn.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.594
How about it? Just you and me.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.223
[crowd clamoring]

05:49.932 --> 05:50.767
No, no, no.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.771
If you lose, you'll be in the medika.
If you win, they'll throw you in the brig.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.732
Shut it down, boys! Shut it down!

05:57.815 --> 05:59.859
You try me without that magic, huh?

05:59.942 --> 06:00.943
It's just air.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.572
Come on! Anyone!

06:05.740 --> 06:07.742
[indistinct chatter]

06:24.092 --> 06:25.218
Alina!

06:32.225 --> 06:33.142
When did you get in?

06:33.684 --> 06:36.104
Yesterday.
Everyone's getting their assignments.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.230
[Alina chuckles]

06:37.313 --> 06:40.608
Suppose cartography's
heading back south. [chuckling]

06:40.691 --> 06:43.069
I found out 'cause
they're putting my unit with yours again.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.363
They're looking
for a way through the mountains.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.115
Oh! So we're back together?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.575
They can't keep
best friends apart for too long.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.662
Corporal Oretsev,
are you saying you miss me?

06:53.538 --> 06:56.999
Well, I need someone to take the fall
for my petty crimes, that's all.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.336
-Oh, they moved our tent.
-Yeah, it's down that end now.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.755
[Alina] So many First Army here.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.675
We look like a halfway house,
accepting donations.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.927
Actually, I won't be
accepting any donations

07:08.010 --> 07:10.471
-because I won this betting on a fight.
-Huh?

07:11.472 --> 07:14.100
Look at you.
Flush with five whole… kruge?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.936
What will you do with foreign money?
We're not in Ketterdam.

07:17.019 --> 07:17.979
Don't crush my dreams.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.730
[woman] Again! Inferni!

07:21.274 --> 07:25.194
Nice. Nice. Good. Good. Again.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.199
[Mal] This is why our tents got moved.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.452
-[woman] Good.
-Grisha wanted more space.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.786
Ugh. Grisha.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.290
Now. I'm going to do it again.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.541
Show-offs.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.127
[woman] Another Inferni and Squaller.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.921
They're always picking on us
when their general's not around.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.133
It's like home all over again.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.927
It wasn't all bad. We learned
some good life lessons back then.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.805
[scoffs] Yeah?
Care to share with the class?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.933
One, don't cry in public.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.937
Hide your emotional breakdown
for when you're alone. Obviously.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.691
-Two, always carry a weapon on you.
-Always.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.693
There's a third I can't remember.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.403
[soldier 1] Open her up, we're loading!

08:07.487 --> 08:08.779
[Alina] That looks new.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.408
Brand-new. Grisha call it ultralight.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.789
Made by their own Fabrikators.
It's supposed to be faster.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.374
What happened to the last one?

08:21.542 --> 08:22.460
Never came back.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.172
-[man] There he is!
-Here we go.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.716
I would have made a killing on you,

08:28.799 --> 08:31.344
but nah, he refused
to loan me any money, so…

08:31.427 --> 08:33.846
That's because you're a child
in a bigger child's body.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.517
-You're shorter than I am.
-Okay. Dubrov, Mikhael, this is Alina.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.728
Your little friend from Keramzin?

08:40.811 --> 08:42.522
-[Dubrov] Ah…
-This is her.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.858
-"Little friend"?
-How is that wrong?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.110
-He talks about you all the time.
-What does he say?

08:48.194 --> 08:50.071
-[Mikhael] Oh, well…
-Don't listen to these two.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.906
They like to exaggerate.
It's what they do.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.951
-[chuckles] Look at him!
-Oh, he's so easy to rile.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.077
Is that annoying you?

08:56.160 --> 08:58.538
Yeah? All right. Come on, you bastard.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.248
-[laughing]
-[Mal taunting indistinctly]

09:00.331 --> 09:03.000
-Come on, then.
-[horn blaring]

09:03.084 --> 09:05.753
-Saved by the horn, Mal.
-[Mal] Oh, I wouldn't say so.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.088
What does he say about me?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.506
[indistinct chatter]

09:11.092 --> 09:12.134
All right, listen up.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.515
I know some of you have been
on the road for a week, so I'll be brief.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.977
Most of you will continue north
to the Fjerdan frontlines.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.229
Or south to the Shu Han border.

09:24.230 --> 09:29.360
The Second Army, however, has a shiny
new solution to our food shortage,

09:29.443 --> 09:32.196
and it sails tomorrow for Novokribirsk.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.615
If this model works,

09:34.699 --> 09:38.119
it means a full meal
for everyone in this tent next week.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.203
[soldiers murmuring]

09:39.287 --> 09:42.915
It means bullets for your guns
and sugar for your tea.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.125
[soldier] How about some whiskey?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.168
[soldiers laughing]

09:46.252 --> 09:48.462
Yes, that would be nice,
but don't hold your breath.

09:49.046 --> 09:52.466
Of course, they need our help
bringing those supplies back,

09:52.550 --> 09:53.884
so some of you will be assigned.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.805
"There's nothing to fear."

09:58.472 --> 10:01.475
"I will now be selecting names
for what I call the 'nightmare lottery.'"

10:01.559 --> 10:02.393
[sniggers]

10:03.394 --> 10:05.646
For the supply run across the Fold!

10:07.106 --> 10:09.150
Sergeant Yure Teplov.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.155
Tracker Malyen Oretsev!

10:14.780 --> 10:15.906
Corporal Masyelentov!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.825
Did he… But you're in our unit.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.869
-Rifleman Valek Tapenyov!
-Uh…

10:19.952 --> 10:21.787
It has to be an error. It has to be.

10:21.871 --> 10:26.208
-Didn't sound like an error, Mal.
-And finally, Medic Nolech Barenovsky.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.253
That's it. Dinner in one hour.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.548
Come back and line up by rank. Dismissed.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.050
Mal.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.306
Well, if it does work,
I'll get to visit Ketterdam.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.522
[thunder rumbling]

10:49.815 --> 10:51.817
[indistinct chatter]

10:57.031 --> 10:57.948
[woman] Come on, come on!

11:00.493 --> 11:01.827
[gambler] Yes! I love it!

11:01.911 --> 11:05.206
Darling, please. Drinks here.
Drinks all round here, please.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.753
Hey, you take Zemeni coin, yes?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.255
[man] Let me see that.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.261
The Lucky Nine casino up the block

11:19.345 --> 11:21.555
has had trouble
with counterfeit coin lately.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.307
Heavy, but brittle.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.102
Oh, come on, now.
I've been here for hours.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.229
My money is good, no?

11:28.312 --> 11:31.065
Zemeni coin can take a bullet.
But the knockoff…

11:40.282 --> 11:41.200
Busted.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.120
What does that prove?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.372
Hey! Wait! What are you doing?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.165
Get off me!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.552
No loud noises at the table, Jesper.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.763
You'll scare off the pigeons.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.932
Wouldn't want that, boss.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.227
-Shouldn't you be on the door?
-Yeah, right away, boss.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.023
Early for action, innit, Kaz?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.316
What do you want, Rotty?

12:14.400 --> 12:18.070
Someone stole a DeKappel from
a merch's private residence last night.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.113
Is that so?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.531
It's a painting.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.701
A landscape of Ravka.
The Fold. Oil on parchment.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.785
I know who DeKappel is.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.246
Well, he don't do nudes,
so I never heard of him.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.622
Get to it, Rotty.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.088
Worth something like 10,000 kruge.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.176
The thief had to get past
four roving guards,

12:40.259 --> 12:41.552
high fences, padlocked doors,

12:41.635 --> 12:44.305
and a security system designed
by one of them Grisha witches.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.682
-Fabrikator.
-Whatever.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.186
The point is,
either it was a group effort or a ghost.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.313
Why does this concern me?

12:54.315 --> 12:56.358
I've got a buyer lined up. Legit money.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.404
So, uh…
if you hear a whisper… [clicks tongue]

13:02.990 --> 13:04.450
Who can hear a whisper here?

13:19.423 --> 13:21.425
[thunder rumbling]

14:06.554 --> 14:07.555
Hello, Inej.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.808
What information
do you have for me tonight?

14:11.642 --> 14:15.563
A lead on a job. A big one.
Enough money to change lives.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.148
It doesn't take much
to change someone's life in the Barrel.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.441
A million kruge?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.029
What's the name?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.448
Dreesen. A wealthy merchant.

14:27.074 --> 14:27.908
Dreesen.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.869
I've heard of him.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.662
He could afford it.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.457
The question is,
what's worth a million kruge to him?

14:35.541 --> 14:38.836
He's looking for a crew
willing to cross the Fold into East Ravka

14:38.919 --> 14:40.462
and bring back something.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.257
The Fold?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.011
Well, of course,
certain death pays a million.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.096
He didn't say what he wants nicked?

14:49.179 --> 14:50.347
No.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.726
But he's taking meetings tonight,
starting at midnight.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.060
Tell me you followed him.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.897
He brought someone in from a ship.

14:59.773 --> 15:03.360
Took a way back to his house
in the Garden District to avoid attention.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.703
I would have followed him inside,
but Dreesen's hired some private security.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.125
I would have had
to use my knives to get closer.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.960
-[thunder rumbling]
-Private security.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.463
Anyone we know?

15:22.546 --> 15:26.258
A Zemeni man.
I think his name is Tendo. You know him?

15:26.342 --> 15:29.261
Yeah. He gambles at one of Pekka's clubs.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.056
So I won't have leverage on him.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.807
But Pekka will.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.147
Kaz, I got this lead from one
of the girls at the Menagerie.

15:40.230 --> 15:43.233
They tell me things in case
you'd buy them out, like you did with me.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
I didn't, I'm paying off your indenture.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.236
You know what I mean.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.906
This one girl, Kesh, she has skill.
She's like me.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.741
I only invest in the one of a kind.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.118
She isn't like you.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.621
No one is.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.881
So? What's our move now?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.307
You're the one of us
who believes in a higher power.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.230
If we're going to survive
a round trip through the Fold,

16:22.106 --> 16:23.524
we'll need a miracle or two.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.623
What's a Shu girl doing here?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.544
I'm Ravkan. On the cartography team.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.630
She's half Shu. An orphan.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.090
[line cook] Is that an answer?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.719
Back of the line. Your friends, too.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.470
I don't know them.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.015
Then you go. Come on!

16:58.225 --> 16:59.059
[plate clatters]

17:00.769 --> 17:02.521
[plate clatters]

17:31.425 --> 17:32.760
[woman] You can get arrested for that.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.555
Stealing from Second Army
will get you thrown in a hole.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.187
Maybe you should arrest me.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.023
Hang on.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.943
Aren't you one of our escorts
for the crossing?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.529
That's right.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.698
Well,

17:55.616 --> 17:56.700
I don't mind sharing.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.537
Well, it's not for me. It's for a friend.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.126
Some of it's for me.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.796
What's your name?

18:09.713 --> 18:11.965
I'm Mal. I'm a tracker.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.052
Zoya. I'm a Squaller.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.807
When I get nerves the night before,

18:20.349 --> 18:22.601
I like to have
a good tumble with a stranger.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.144
Clears my head.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.313
That's my remedy.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.027
I should go.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.364
You don't seem like the type
who does what they should.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.270
[Mal laughing]

19:06.728 --> 19:08.063
[sighs] I found you.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.731
[Alina] You always do, somehow.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.401
Well, it's not hard, you always perch.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.403
[scoffs] I'm brooding.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.779
[sniffles]

19:15.863 --> 19:18.574
Well, I have something for you.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.160
Where did you get these?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.122
-I stole them.
-From a Grisha tent? [laughs]

19:25.205 --> 19:27.332
I thought it would
get me an invitation to jail,

19:27.416 --> 19:30.085
but it just got me an invitation
to tumble with a Grisha.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.504
You tumbled a Grisha?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.840
[chuckles] No.
No, I just flirted with her.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.634
Maybe she flirted with me.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.722
-Look, Grisha women scare me. Okay?
-[chuckles]

19:41.805 --> 19:42.639
[sniffles]

19:45.392 --> 19:47.436
Did you see the lieutenant?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.272
Yeah.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.941
And?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.484
Well…

19:56.904 --> 19:59.823
turns out they do need me. So…

20:03.702 --> 20:04.661
So…

20:10.500 --> 20:12.961
I could shoot you in the foot.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.299
-You're a terrible shot.
-[chuckles]

20:21.845 --> 20:23.847
[thunder rumbling]

20:29.061 --> 20:30.062
Don't cross it.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.155
When I was young,

20:42.282 --> 20:43.825
I had nightmares about it.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.496
Going in.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.333
Finding my parents…

20:52.251 --> 20:53.168
still dead.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.880
Waiting for me.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.890
-Well, orders are orders.
-[scoffs]

21:09.851 --> 21:14.064
If it goes wrong, come back.
You've lost enough to it already.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.492
I'll find my way back to you.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.455
Promise.

21:36.586 --> 21:40.924
But first,
I am going gambling in Ketterdam.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.510
[chuckling] Without me?

21:44.219 --> 21:45.345
[Mal sighs]

21:46.013 --> 21:47.014
I'll write you a letter.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.445
[Kaz] Tell us
how to safely cross the Fold.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.196
The Fold?

22:03.780 --> 22:05.657
If I knew safe passage through that,

22:05.741 --> 22:08.160
I'd be wealthier
than the whole Merchant Council.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.039
You told me you brought in girls
from Os Alta. The other side.

22:12.122 --> 22:16.126
Yeah. The hard way.
Lost a few to those damn volcra, too.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.128
Nah, there's no trick to it

22:18.211 --> 22:20.964
except how it makes people
disappear from time to time.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.258
I heard you bragging
of a way to make a path.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.220
I was taking kruge from a tourist.
A little lie.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.725
The Fold keeps those Ravkan bastards
and their Grisha attack dogs in check.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.436
Can you imagine how dangerous
it would be if it wasn't there?

22:35.103 --> 22:36.063
[man] Just go around.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.398
It stretches all the way north
to the Fjerdan border.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.735
Ja. So go to Fjerda.
March through the permafrost.

22:41.818 --> 22:42.861
How long would that take?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.489
From here? Four months.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.824
Maybe five.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.701
We don't have that kind of time.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.829
Either you take your time
or you take your chances.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.956
-[boxing bell ringing]
-[people cheering]

22:57.167 --> 22:59.628
[indistinct chatter]

23:04.883 --> 23:05.926
Here's what I don't get.

23:06.009 --> 23:09.012
-We're going to be here all night.
-Rude.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.891
Why haven't they tried going under it?
Just dig a tunnel.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.768
Tried that. More than a century ago.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.480
Something… heard them digging.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.274
It was made hundreds of years ago
by that crazy Grisha…

23:21.358 --> 23:22.275
The Black Heretic.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.737
The one who controls shadow.
They've got one in their army now.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.822
General Kirigan?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.490
[Inej] Your point?

23:28.573 --> 23:31.368
[Jesper] If one of his kind made it,
can't he unmake it?

23:31.451 --> 23:33.537
Have you ever
put out fire by adding more fire?

23:33.620 --> 23:34.871
Then what's the opposite?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.290
-A Sun Summoner.
-[Jesper] Right, then, one of those.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.375
Doesn't exist.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.627
Doesn't exist yet.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.255
Dreesen comes into town,
doesn't waste a minute.

23:43.338 --> 23:46.216
Sends out for a crew to steal something
but doesn't specify what.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.053
Is it heavy, large, worth more
than a million on the black market?

23:51.012 --> 23:52.139
Maybe he doesn't know.

23:52.806 --> 23:53.974
We can let this one go, Kaz.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.935
-Sounds like a trap, anyway.
-[Kaz] A trap would sound easy.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.770
[footsteps approaching]

23:58.854 --> 23:59.855
This is something else.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.940
[man] Boss, boss.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.942
We intercepted a note from Dreesen.

24:04.734 --> 24:05.610
Did you, now?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.195
It's for the owner of the Orchid.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.823
Says they require
the services of a Heartrender. Tonight.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.034
A Heartrender? Why?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.579
Doesn't say.
Just they need it before midnight.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.499
You don't bring in a Heartrender

24:19.583 --> 24:22.544
unless you need an answer
out of someone who isn't willing to talk.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.630
That's how we get this job
before anyone else.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.216
Bring Dreesen a Heartrender.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.595
[man] Boss, just one problem.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.181
Pekka Rollins knows.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.893
Pekka Rollins.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.065
[chuckles] Pekka Rollins.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.485
-[grunts]
-[groaning]

24:53.200 --> 24:56.328
So, you know who I am.
That makes things easier.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.580
[man] You lead the Dime Lions.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.293
My men tell me that you run this club.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.879
I do. [wheezing]

25:07.589 --> 25:09.299
And the brothel next door.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.260
-The Orchid.
-That's right.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.890
Fine girls there.
Boys, too. Whatever you like.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.558
Abram, get in here!

25:18.642 --> 25:22.270
Hmm. Abram wouldn't let us talk,
so we did the other thing.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.857
I'll jump straight to it.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.362
I'm in need of a Heartrender tonight
for a million-kruge job.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.282
And you got one. At the Orchid.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.534
[man] You want Milana, then.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.287
I can get you
a good rate for her by the hour…

25:39.371 --> 25:41.206
No, no, I'm not renting her.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.083
It's for a job.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.169
If I bring her back,
she'll tell you about the job.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.588
Next thing you know,
everyone is talking about the job.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.007
[breathing heavily]
My indentures are discreet.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.760
[Pekka] Hmm.
Because they work for you, right?

25:55.887 --> 25:57.097
So here's the deal.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.975
Work for me,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.352
give over this dump and the Orchid,

26:02.435 --> 26:05.188
then I'll give you 10%
of whatever business comes in.

26:06.481 --> 26:10.151
[chuckling] That's a shit deal.
I already get 100%.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.779
[Pekka] Yeah, okay.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.907
The other option is…

26:19.577 --> 26:21.329
I'll carve you up

26:21.413 --> 26:23.873
and leave you in a barrel for the rats.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.043
So…

26:28.169 --> 26:29.337
how about ten?

26:43.018 --> 26:44.185
Cheer up, Dubrov.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.188
The Black General's here to save the day.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.400
Oh, is he going to tear down the Fold?

26:51.401 --> 26:53.528
No, I was being sarcastic.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.363
Oh.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.868
He's a Grisha, not a miracle-worker.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.917
Is it him?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.378
General Kirigan.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.923
The leader of the Second Army
here to grace us with his presence?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.843
He must believe the new skiff
will be a shining success.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.554
[man] Or a spectacular failure.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.972
-Alexei.
-[Alexei] What?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.392
Sorry, Mal.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.485
Do you think he's coming with us?

27:33.568 --> 27:36.780
If he does,
then you know what he believes.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.199
Are we children, or are we soldiers?

27:39.282 --> 27:42.202
Get to your posts and pack your gear.
Skiff launches in 20.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.162
Sergeant, get your crew ready!

27:44.245 --> 27:47.874
Mal, you're with me, son. Chin up.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.001
I've crossed it three times
without incident.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.586
You'll get your first soon enough.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.427
I'll be back before you know it.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.767
And I'll be here the whole time.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.688
Me and the cartographers, I mean.

28:15.318 --> 28:16.694
[young Alina] We can't hide forever.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.989
We can run. Together.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.084
[blows]

29:20.467 --> 29:23.762
Petya, how did this happen?

29:23.845 --> 29:27.098
We don't know. We were extra
careful to secure all the lanterns.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.184
-And what was damaged?
-Nothing major.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.394
Just some records
of the western coast line,

29:31.478 --> 29:33.688
Os Kervo and the river system
that runs through it.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.939
-It's really not…
-Critical?

29:35.023 --> 29:38.610
Geographical data of the territory
on the other side of the damn Fold?

29:39.194 --> 29:40.528
Those records?

29:41.279 --> 29:43.907
Yes, but I'm sure that the First Army
on the other side has an--

29:43.990 --> 29:45.825
You think I trust anyone else's intel?

29:45.909 --> 29:48.870
Now someone will have to cross the Fold,
to redraw these maps.

29:48.953 --> 29:52.040
I'll go. Put me on the skiff, I'll go.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.709
Yes. You will.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.712
Your whole unit will.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.636
I don't understand.
We were going south, now we're going west?

30:04.719 --> 30:06.304
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.848
Leave her alone, Raisa.
You want everything to be her fault.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.058
I'm usually right.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.398
[loud rumbling]

30:38.086 --> 30:40.463
-[Alina gasps]
-What the hell are you doing here?

30:41.089 --> 30:43.967
-We've been assigned with you.
-No. Turn around right now.

30:44.050 --> 30:44.968
Orders are orders.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.679
I could shoot you in the foot.

30:47.762 --> 30:49.430
I like my feet, thank you.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.893
-Tell them you're too sick to go.
-I'm never that sick.

30:53.977 --> 30:54.936
Lie if you have to.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.522
And what's your lie? I'm with you.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.024
Get off this boat now,
or I'll carry you off.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.067
[Sergeant Yure] Raise the gate!

31:02.527 --> 31:03.778
Ready to lock up.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.788
I'll make it, promise.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.373
[sighs]

31:17.375 --> 31:19.669
Sergeant! What now?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.130
The Grisha will tell us.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.718
Not her. The Inferni.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.263
[claps hands] Here's how it goes.
We go into the Fold,

31:30.346 --> 31:32.515
it gets dark, but we like it dark.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.350
That keeps us from drawing attention.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.019
That's how we travel.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.980
The only light we use
is the blue one at the mast.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.316
It's weak but safe.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.901
[Raisa] But you're an Inferni, right?

31:42.984 --> 31:45.236
Why are you here
if we're supposed to keep things dark?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.448
For when the dark comes to keep you.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.533
Where's your general? Kirigan?

31:56.414 --> 31:57.540
[sailor] Ready for launch!

31:58.124 --> 31:59.208
That's our cue.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.094
[wind gusting]

32:14.349 --> 32:16.684
Right, listen to me, cartographers.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.479
Until we reach the western dry docks,

32:19.562 --> 32:21.981
you are to remain at your station.

32:22.065 --> 32:27.654
Do not, I repeat, do not leave
the skiff during the crossing.

32:32.116 --> 32:32.951
[gasps]

32:44.128 --> 32:47.173
In we go.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.322
[thunder rumbling]

33:12.115 --> 33:14.325
[growling in distance]

33:26.004 --> 33:27.547
-[thunder clap]
-[thudding]

33:32.010 --> 33:34.595
[growling in distance]

33:53.781 --> 33:54.824
Marker one.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.118
How many more are there?

33:57.702 --> 33:58.828
Thirty-seven.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.422
[creature screeching]

34:09.505 --> 34:10.923
[creature growling]

34:12.842 --> 34:14.844
[creature growling]

34:26.647 --> 34:28.900
-[creature growling]
-[guns cocking]

34:35.281 --> 34:36.324
[gun cocks]

34:38.201 --> 34:39.535
[whispering indistinctly]

34:40.411 --> 34:42.246
[creature screeching]

34:46.751 --> 34:47.668
No.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.004
[lighter clicking]

34:50.088 --> 34:52.090
[breathing heavily]

34:59.305 --> 35:01.307
[breath trembling]

35:02.016 --> 35:05.228
-Blow it out! What are you doing?
-[creature growling]

35:11.692 --> 35:13.653
[soldier 1 screaming]

35:16.948 --> 35:17.990
[creatures growling]

35:21.452 --> 35:23.287
-[creature growling]
-[soldier 2 screaming]

35:23.371 --> 35:24.747
[gunshots]

35:25.706 --> 35:26.624
What do we--

35:28.960 --> 35:30.419
[indistinct shouting]

35:30.503 --> 35:31.796
[creature growling]

35:31.879 --> 35:32.755
[gun cocks]

35:35.258 --> 35:37.260
[guns firing]

35:46.185 --> 35:49.438
Come at me! Come at me, you coward!

35:57.864 --> 35:58.906
[Alina] Alexei, no!

36:02.326 --> 36:04.453
[Mal screaming]

36:05.037 --> 36:05.997
[creature growling]

36:06.747 --> 36:07.915
[mouthing] Mal!

36:18.009 --> 36:20.052
[creature shrieking]

36:20.136 --> 36:21.512
Mal!

36:40.740 --> 36:42.200
I'll meet you at the meadow.

36:42.783 --> 36:43.910
[sobs]

36:48.122 --> 36:49.040
[gasps]

37:26.494 --> 37:28.162
[growling in distance]

37:30.581 --> 37:33.251
General Zlatan. Your orders?

37:34.460 --> 37:35.586
It's been too long.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.298
They should have emerged two hours ago.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.303
[soldier] Sir! Look!

38:09.370 --> 38:10.955
Where is the rest of your crew?

38:19.088 --> 38:19.922
So…

38:20.631 --> 38:21.757
new management, gents.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.051
Here's the deal.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.720
The Heartrender is gone, boss.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.972
Someone else got her.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.141
Who?

38:41.193 --> 38:43.321
I really appreciate new business,

38:43.404 --> 38:46.073
but you've only paid
for an hour of my time,

38:46.157 --> 38:47.992
and I have to be back at the Orchid.

38:48.075 --> 38:51.245
[Kaz] The Orchid isn't safe tonight.
Your life's in danger with this job.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.581
Make yourself scarce
for a few days afterwards.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.583
Mr. Brekker,
are you threatening me? Really?

38:55.666 --> 38:58.502
Even if I'm nice,
my boss will call the stadwatch on you.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.547
It's not me you're in danger with.
It's Pekka Rollins.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.425
My boss would call
the stadwatch on him as well.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.886
Which is why your boss is already dead.

39:07.887 --> 39:10.056
-[man] Who are you lot?
-We're here to see Dreesen.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.932
[man] You're not with Pekka's crew.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.061
And you're not in Pekka's pocket anymore
if you don't owe him.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.816
Hey, where did you get that coin?

39:21.317 --> 39:24.570
[man] Hey! One of these has a hole in it!

39:24.653 --> 39:25.780
Saints.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.074
-Inside. Inside.
-[laughing]

39:34.038 --> 39:36.707
One look and I can tell. Criminals.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.086
I'm not meeting anyone 'til midnight.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.921
We heard you needed a Heartrender.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.634
[Dreesen] Hmm.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.595
All right, she stays,
the rest of you, out.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.600
She stays.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.561
And we have an exclusive on this job.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.605
Mr. Brekker.

40:00.606 --> 40:04.568
No businessman worth his salt
hires his first applicant.

40:05.319 --> 40:07.571
[Kaz] No. No, I understand.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.492
Of course,
I will have to report you to the guild

40:12.243 --> 40:15.287
for kidnapping and harboring
a prisoner without chain of title.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.086
You wouldn't.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.630
No businessman worth his salt

40:25.172 --> 40:27.007
bargains for what he can take.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.226
[inhales deeply]

40:38.811 --> 40:41.105
[exhales heavily]

40:43.149 --> 40:43.983
[Dreesen] Mmm.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.610
I have to be back in an hour.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.490
All right, come on.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.012
Who's this?

41:15.264 --> 41:16.891
So you don't know everything after all.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.393
This…

41:20.394 --> 41:21.479
is Alexei Stepanov.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.065
Two weeks ago, young Alexei here

41:25.649 --> 41:27.610
crossed through the Fold on foot.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.278
Alone.

41:32.781 --> 41:33.782
How?

41:33.866 --> 41:34.950
They're keeping it quiet,

41:35.701 --> 41:36.952
but allegedly

41:37.036 --> 41:40.456
-he was one of a few witnesses to…
-[water pouring]

41:40.539 --> 41:41.916
…an event.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.043
[Alexei] Water.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.589
[water pouring]

41:52.259 --> 41:53.552
What kind of event?

41:54.929 --> 41:57.723
[Dreesen] I know an expedition
was swarmed by volcra.

41:58.390 --> 42:00.059
Should've been a total loss,

42:00.684 --> 42:02.853
but something happened.

42:04.813 --> 42:06.941
Some device detonated.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.735
Obliterated the volcra,

42:10.319 --> 42:12.404
lit up the dark like a forest fire.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.495
I know it wasn't a fire
or else no one would have survived.

42:19.578 --> 42:20.621
[people clamoring]

42:20.704 --> 42:25.209
[Dreesen] This was some invention
no one had seen before.

42:29.046 --> 42:29.964
[Zoya] Healer!

42:31.131 --> 42:32.258
He knows.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.804
But he doesn't seem to be able
to articulate his account of events.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.517
Some form of traumatic lapse.

42:48.941 --> 42:49.858
So…

43:03.372 --> 43:04.582
[Milana] You're safe now.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.166
[heart beating loudly]

43:13.257 --> 43:15.843
[heartbeat slows]

43:17.720 --> 43:19.680
Now you can just speak

43:20.764 --> 43:22.391
and I will just listen.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.018
All right.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.897
Tell me what happened in the Fold.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.734
What saved you?

43:36.822 --> 43:38.824
[air whooshing]

43:41.285 --> 43:43.245
[volcra growling]

43:45.664 --> 43:47.583
[Alexei] You won't believe me, but…

43:57.718 --> 43:59.428
it was a Sun Summoner.

43:59.511 --> 44:00.721
[gasps]

44:19.156 --> 44:20.407
Who was it?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.954
If I tell you, you'll set me free?

44:26.538 --> 44:29.208
You have my word. I'll set you free.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.587
You're in Ketterdam now, Alexei.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.050
You can go anywhere
in the world from here.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.222
Just imagine.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.226
Come on.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.064
Her name is…

44:52.147 --> 44:54.441
[heart beating slowly]

44:56.235 --> 44:57.319
Alina Starkov.

44:58.862 --> 45:00.239
[Dreesen] Alina Starkov?

45:02.491 --> 45:03.575
Good boy.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.705
Show me the manifest.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.464
-[heart beating slowly]
-[Milana] Hmm.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.843
[Milana sighs]

45:22.553 --> 45:23.554
Perfect.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.306
You'll set me free now?

45:26.390 --> 45:27.975
Thank you. Of course.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.435
[gasps and screams]

45:41.864 --> 45:42.698
[Dreesen] Hmm.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.494
We are now the only people
west of the Fold with this information.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.914
My ship sails for West Ravka at dawn.

45:50.998 --> 45:54.543
If you can prove that you have
a way through the Fold and back,

45:55.169 --> 45:57.379
I'll put you on that ship with an advance.

45:57.963 --> 46:01.425
If you don't,
I'm giving this job to Pekka Rollins.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.970
Give me a day. I'll have a plan.

46:05.637 --> 46:08.015
You have until sunrise,

46:08.599 --> 46:10.976
then your ship
will have sailed, Mr. Brekker.

46:11.059 --> 46:13.729
The prize is one million kruge.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.608
Now bring me Alina Starkov.
