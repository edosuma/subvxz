<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:02.369 --> 00:03.495
Do I know you?

00:03.570 --> 00:05.060
You should. I'm your sister-in-law.

00:05.138 --> 00:07.436
We agreed to keep
what happened between us a secret.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.372
Relax, Nathan. Haley doesn't have a clue.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.637
Jenny's mine now. Hand her over.

00:11.711 --> 00:12.939
Forget it.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.379
The rumors. They weren't rumors.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.109
I'm gay.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.413
This is all my stuff. I don't understand.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.420
I had my mom talk to your parents...

00:21.488 --> 00:24.082
and they said that you could stay here
till the summer.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.557
Thank you, Karen.
You know you saved my life, right?

00:26.626 --> 00:28.218
I'm not gonna make it easy on you...

00:28.294 --> 00:31.286
and sometimes
you're not gonna like me for it.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.324
It's just like having a real mom.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.512
Hello?

01:29.589 --> 01:32.114
<i>Think fast. What's in a gin and tonic?</i>

01:32.192 --> 01:33.250
Taylor?

01:33.326 --> 01:35.624
Can you believe
two guys already fell for that one today?

01:35.695 --> 01:37.026
Drunks are so easy.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.294
-Let me guess. You're in a bar.
<i>-Not just any bar.</i>

01:40.366 --> 01:42.766
I will have you know,
I am in Athens, Georgia...

01:42.836 --> 01:44.667
at the famous Swinging Donkey.

01:44.737 --> 01:46.102
What happened to Florida?

01:46.172 --> 01:48.572
<i>Florida's still there. I'm just not in it.</i>

01:48.641 --> 01:49.801
<i>So, how about you?</i>

01:49.976 --> 01:52.774
I think I just passed a place
called Slicklizzard, Alabama.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.915
Which means
you went chasing after my sister.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.981
Tell me she's sitting next to you.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.720
No, I'm afraid not.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.154
I'm sorry, Nathan.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.389
-Listen, I got to run.
-What's going on?

02:12.465 --> 02:15.434
Don't ask. I'll see you when I see you.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.810
You sure about this, Luke?

02:24.878 --> 02:27.244
Trust me. I talked to Nathan before he left.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.611
-He said it was okay.
-How's he doing, anyway?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.818
Not so good, I guess.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.880
Yeah, it may not be the cleanest...

02:37.957 --> 02:40.482
but it's a good place to hide out
for the next couple of days.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.584
So get settled.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.686
I got to run over to the dealership
before school.

02:43.763 --> 02:45.731
What time are you meeting
with your lawyer today?

02:45.798 --> 02:48.596
A couple of hours.
I'm sorry I had to drag you into this mess.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.829
I just....
I couldn't involve my parents, you know.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.464
I told you. If you need me, call me.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.536
AII right? See you.

03:10.823 --> 03:12.723
Hey, Lucas. What's up?

03:13.860 --> 03:17.694
Nothing. Just dropping some papers off
for you to sign.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.397
Everything okay?

03:19.465 --> 03:22.957
Yeah, I guess
I just didn't get much sleep last night.

03:23.169 --> 03:25.194
Yeah, I noticed you were up early.

03:25.271 --> 03:28.069
Been working yourself pretty hard lately.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.609
I'll be fine.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.570
I'll tell you what.
Take the day off tomorrow.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.842
Bet you haven't been
to River Court in a few days.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.247
Don't want to lose your stroke.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.786
-It has been a while.
-Done.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.484
I'm heading off to a meeting.
I'll see you later.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.672
Cash?

04:42.415 --> 04:43.507
Yeah.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.679
How much?

04:46.352 --> 04:49.287
Too much to count
while my head was in the ceiling.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.482
Did you find anything else?

04:52.091 --> 04:53.991
There was a notebook in one of the bags.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.585
I didn't get a good look at it,
but it looked like a ledger.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.824
Makes sense.
Got to keep track of all that money.

04:58.898 --> 05:02.629
Yeah, but I'm just wondering,
why keep it all in the ceiling?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.636
Why not keep it in a bank where it's safe?

05:04.704 --> 05:07.138
There's two reasons to hide money, Lucas.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.834
Either you don't want
Uncle Sam to know you have it...

05:09.909 --> 05:12.844
or you don't want him to know
how you got it.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.542
-I got to get that ledger.
-No, you don't.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.709
Andy.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.011
We got to get that ledger.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.923
-Darby.
-Hi, Anna.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.800
-What are you doing here?
-I got your e-mail.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.026
Can I come in?

05:40.873 --> 05:43.569
Or we could just stand out here
until someone sees us...

05:43.643 --> 05:45.838
start some rumors,
and then you can move again.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.072
Darby.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.710
I'm sorry. That wasn't funny.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.888
-Maybe this was a bad idea.
-No.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.554
It's good to see you.

05:59.992 --> 06:01.357
Come on in.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.637
Okay. Look, just tell me what is going on...

06:12.705 --> 06:17.005
because there's no way that a judge
would give Nicki custody of Jenny.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.537
The judge has already ruled.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.604
Jake, a warrant's been issued
for your arrest.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.513
Right now, the police are out there...

06:24.584 --> 06:26.575
and they're looking
for you and your daughter.

06:26.652 --> 06:30.452
Trust me. Trust me when I tell you
this is your only option.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.455
Will you just tell me the truth here?

06:38.431 --> 06:41.400
If I give up my daughter today,
how long until I get her back?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.628
How long until Jenny's safe?

06:46.139 --> 06:48.130
Two months. Maybe three.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.969
And if I don't give her up?

06:53.045 --> 06:56.139
You go to jail.
And you stay there until you do.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.289
How about a gin and tonic?

07:13.533 --> 07:15.524
How about I see some ID?

07:20.473 --> 07:22.464
So, what brings you to town, sailor?

07:22.542 --> 07:24.737
Just wanted to check out
the Swinging Donkey.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.212
See if it's really as classy
as everybody says it is.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.806
-And what do you think?
-Not so much.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.712
But it does have one thing
I'm kind of craving.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.550
-I know. Gin and tonic.
-Yeah. That, too.

07:39.992 --> 07:43.120
I guess my phone call worked.
You staying the night?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.997
I don't know.
Haven't thought that far ahead.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.192
I'm house-sitting
in the apartment upstairs.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.735
You're welcome
to stay with me if you like.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.395
What do you say?

07:53.506 --> 07:55.269
That sounds like a plan.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.921
Why is it the garbage men
always forget to pick up the white trash?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.622
-I need to talk to Jake.
-Right.

08:17.697 --> 08:21.565
No police. No lawyers.
Just me and Jake. The River Court. 6:00.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.437
By the way,
the police are watching you right now.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.341
And you should know,
as long as you help Jake hide Jenny...

08:34.413 --> 08:35.937
you're an accessory.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.849
That means, when you're caught with
my daughter, you're gonna get arrested.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.616
But don't worry.
You can always go to college after prison.

08:52.064 --> 08:55.522
So I guess you told everybody
back at school about us.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.068
No. Just me.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.038
How did people take it?

09:00.106 --> 09:02.904
It was pretty divided. It still is, I guess.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.240
Some people don't want
to be seen with me. That part sucks.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.577
But I guess you find out
who your real friends are.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.316
You know, the truth is, Anna...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.181
there were some pretty dark days
after you left.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.416
And it hasn't gotten much easier.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.324
But do I regret being with you?
Coming out?

09:22.261 --> 09:24.752
No. Not for a minute.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.660
And you know
what makes it always better?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.794
Vanilla lattes, extra foam.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.305
You know, we should probably head back.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.704
Hey, Anna.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.674
Hey, Lucas.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.610
This is Darby. She's....

09:43.349 --> 09:47.479
Actually, Lucas, Darby's the girl
I told you about from my old school.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.544
Oh, my God. I've heard so much about you.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.646
Really?

09:50.723 --> 09:52.691
Yeah, you're different
than I imagined, but--

09:52.758 --> 09:54.453
Thought I'd be more butch?

09:54.527 --> 09:56.427
Okay, I didn't mean....

09:56.495 --> 09:57.985
Just kidding.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.223
I was just giving Darby
the Tree Hill grand tour.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.598
Do you want to tag along?

10:03.669 --> 10:07.969
I'd love to, but I got to go meet someone,
so call me tomorrow, okay?

10:09.809 --> 10:11.970
Pleasure to meet you, Darby.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.974
So that's the famous Lucas, huh?
He's cute.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.349
-So, who's the better kisser? Me or him?
-Stop it.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.459
Bevin! Hi!

10:31.797 --> 10:34.231
I have always imagined this room.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.301
Just darker. And with Lucas on the bed.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.399
-Anyway, get dressed.
-What for?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.942
-It's a surprise.
-I can't. I have to work.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.308
I promised Karen
I'd help her out at the cafe.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.481
The cheer squad's
throwing a party tonight...

10:49.548 --> 10:51.379
and you kind of need to be there.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.941
The squad has
some serious concerns, Brooke.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.750
Ever since you started
this whole presidency thing...

10:56.822 --> 10:58.619
you've been drifting.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.419
I am still your captain, okay? I promise.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.861
Then prove it. Please?

11:04.930 --> 11:06.329
We miss you.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.132
Karen did say
she only needed me for a few hours...

11:11.203 --> 11:13.330
so I guess I could do both.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.666
What do I wear
to a cheer intervention, anyway?

11:26.852 --> 11:27.944
Jake.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.782
How did you find me here?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.518
I guess I'm just better at this than you are.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.253
You wanted to talk. Let's talk.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.557
I told you to meet me at 6:00.
It's only 5:00.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.495
Like I'm gonna fall for that.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.796
Jake, look, you got to stop this.
The hiding, all of it.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.700
I have a right to my daughter.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.940
You're not getting her.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.172
I guess it's time
that I tell you something...

11:54.246 --> 11:56.476
that at the moment is kind of relevant.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.608
Okay, this should be good.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.521
She's not your daughter.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.348
Think about it. We always used protection.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.762
Nice try.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.667
Guess it was just a matter of time
before you thought of that one, huh?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.675
-It's the truth.
-No. This is the only truth.

12:24.276 --> 12:28.144
No matter what, Jenny is,
and she will always be, my daughter.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.476
We're done here.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.733
Okay, get into the game, little girl.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.963
I always knew you were a lightweight,
but this is getting embarrassing.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.094
I'm just warming up.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.798
You've been warming up for two hours.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.808
-Jog out of the bullpen and do a shot!
-Okay.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.878
How did you end up here?

13:05.951 --> 13:09.182
What? At this dream job?
I don't know. It's kind of what I do best.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.281
-Bartending?
-Find random places to party.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.623
Next week it'll be someplace else.
Lucky me.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.957
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.693
Neither is Haley.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.802
Nathan, you should know
that before I called you--

13:24.870 --> 13:27.304
Taylor, come on. We need you now.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.101
We'll talk about this later.
I got to get to work.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.734
I thought you said your shift was over.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.574
Somebody's got to pay for these drinks.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.513
Something tells me
you're gonna enjoy this.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.911
Karen. Hi.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.046
Did you have fun tonight?

15:25.524 --> 15:26.889
Not really.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.425
Party was kind of weak,
but I had to be there.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.091
Apparently I've been drifting.

15:33.165 --> 15:34.826
You been drinking?

15:35.234 --> 15:37.065
No, drifting.

15:39.905 --> 15:43.397
No, Brooke. I'm asking you
if you've been drinking tonight.

15:44.476 --> 15:47.309
-Just a little.
-I expected you at the cafe.

15:47.379 --> 15:50.314
I know. I lost track of time. I'm sorry.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.647
Sorry isn't good enough.
I advanced your salary.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.922
I'd like you to return the money I gave you.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.549
I kind of spent it.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.256
-Go to bed. You're grounded.
-Grounded?

16:09.168 --> 16:11.534
I've never been grounded in my whole life.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.571
There's a first time for everything.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.334
Well, you're not my mom.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.806
No. But right now,
you're my responsibility.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.043
But I was drifting.

16:42.401 --> 16:46.098
-Okay, are there any security cameras?
-No, just the alarm.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.707
Okay, remember what I said.
In and out. We do this fast.

17:07.726 --> 17:11.627
Okay, just grab the ledger.
I'll stay here and keep an eye out.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.196
-What do you got?
-It's gone.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.102
-What, the ledger?
-AII of it.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.912
I don't understand.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.477
It was right there a few hours ago.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.818
He knows.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.856
Dan. He knows, and he moved it.

17:42.928 --> 17:46.022
-So, what do we do?
-That's it. No. Game over.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.122
So Dan wins.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.997
As much as I would love to keep playing
this little game with Dan...

17:50.069 --> 17:51.229
it just got serious.

17:51.303 --> 17:54.704
If he knows you found that money,
there's no telling what he's gonna do.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.070
I'm his son, Andy.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.405
And look what he just did to his brother.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.002
This guy's got no conscience, Lucas.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.580
I think it's time
you moved back in with your mother.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.878
I can't.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.879
Come on, Andy. We're so close.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.596
You have to find out if I'm right, okay?

18:18.664 --> 18:21.497
If there's any chance
he's onto you, you have to get out.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.899
I will. I promise.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.593
One more thing.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.072
If your mother asks me anything
about this, I'm not gonna lie to her.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.506
Understood?

18:44.423 --> 18:45.947
-Brooke.
-Yeah?

18:50.529 --> 18:51.553
What's this?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.758
Some stuff I ordered from
the <i>mark.</i> magalog. Pretty great, huh?

18:54.833 --> 18:58.030
-Are you going somewhere?
-Just out for a quick run.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.867
But you never know who you're gonna see.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.472
Aren't you forgetting something?

19:04.810 --> 19:07.335
-Lip gloss.
-Brooke, you're grounded.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.744
That means you don't get to head out
for quick runs.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.010
Since when does grounding
apply to fitness?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.449
Since now.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.478
-That's a little harsh, if you ask me.
-I'm not asking.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.814
Okay, so what am I supposed to do here?

19:19.892 --> 19:22.360
-Lucas does chores.
-Chores?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.385
Here's a list.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.524
-So, what, I pick the one I want to do?
-Sure.

19:30.602 --> 19:34.971
And after you've finished with it,
keep on picking until they're all done.

19:35.040 --> 19:39.306
Okay, no offense, I didn't come here
to be a cleaning lady, lady.

19:40.746 --> 19:44.705
Then I'll help you pack your bags,
and we'll call your folks.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.081
So I'm, like, imprisoned here?

19:47.452 --> 19:50.478
You can leave the house
to go to school and to go to work.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.183
What work? I don't even have a job.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.884
But you do have a job.

19:53.959 --> 19:58.328
Until you pay me back the money
I gave you, you have a job at the cafe.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.012
You wanted to see me, Coach?

20:16.081 --> 20:19.141
Take a seat
next to your partner in crime here.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.824
Now, Bonnie and Clyde...

20:34.399 --> 20:37.459
I guess you're wondering
why I called you here.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.402
Luke, I was just actually....

20:45.210 --> 20:48.304
He just wants
to talk to you for a minute, Jake.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.173
I'll leave you two alone.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.019
I already know my options, Coach.

20:57.556 --> 21:00.047
From what I've heard,
you've only got one option.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.990
I can't give her away.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.686
Son, you've got a good chance
of getting her back.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.096
I can't take chances like that.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.661
-It beats the alternative, doesn't it?
-Does it?

21:18.143 --> 21:21.943
Coach, you remember last year,
the beginning of the season...

21:22.014 --> 21:23.948
we had that away game at Bear Creek?

21:24.016 --> 21:27.179
-Yeah, I remember.
-It was right after Jenny was born.

21:27.252 --> 21:29.277
And my parents were out of town
all week.

21:29.354 --> 21:33.654
I couldn't watch her, so I decided
to let Nicki have her for the night.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.356
So I get home from the game,
and I call Nicki.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.124
There's no answer.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.628
I go to her house, and she's not home.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.635
So I looked everywhere.
I called her friends.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.466
Then finally, after about an hour...

21:46.538 --> 21:50.531
I find her car, and it's parked
across the street from some bar.

21:50.876 --> 21:53.436
Nicki was passed out in the front seat.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.173
The keys were still in the ignition...

21:55.247 --> 21:58.341
and there was frost all over the windows.
I couldn't even see her.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.942
And then I look in the back seat...

22:01.286 --> 22:03.686
and there she is, my little girl.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.318
She's shivering.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.424
She didn't even have
a blanket on her, Coach.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.860
-Jake--
-One night.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.995
AII she had to do
was look after Jenny for one night.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.030
She couldn't do it.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.140
Now they want me
to give her my daughter...

22:23.208 --> 22:25.642
for three months' worth of nights?

22:36.988 --> 22:39.650
So, how'd it feel
when you came out to Lucas?

22:39.725 --> 22:40.987
Terrible.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.820
Scary.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.526
It still feels scary.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.699
What about you,
when you told your parents?

22:52.304 --> 22:55.603
Believe it or not,
I practiced in the mirror first.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.403
And then when I thought
I had it all memorized...

22:58.477 --> 23:01.173
I went downstairs, took a deep breath...

23:01.246 --> 23:03.111
and I told them I loved them very much...

23:03.181 --> 23:06.344
but I had something
I needed to tell them about myself.

23:06.418 --> 23:07.612
How did they take it?

23:07.686 --> 23:10.177
Honestly, not as well as I'd hoped.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.418
I think they're still trying to process
how it affects their lives.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.119
What do you mean?

23:15.594 --> 23:17.357
I read this book about coming out...

23:17.429 --> 23:19.397
and it said that for some parents...

23:19.464 --> 23:23.059
finding out your child is gay
is like losing a loved one.

23:23.435 --> 23:26.370
AII the dreams they might've had
just vanish.

23:27.939 --> 23:30.772
Weddings. Grandchildren.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.210
So I think when I told them...

23:34.279 --> 23:37.077
I shattered some of those dreams
for them.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.914
Even though
things are still kind of weird...

23:41.987 --> 23:44.979
I don't think
I've ever been closer to them...

23:45.490 --> 23:47.822
'cause at the end of the day...

23:49.094 --> 23:51.153
I know they still love me.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.194
And that's what worried me the most.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.537
That they wouldn't.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.872
You're braver than me, Darby.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.346
No, I'm not.

24:14.019 --> 24:15.213
Look...

24:16.021 --> 24:19.650
I didn't come here
to get you to come out to your parents.

24:19.724 --> 24:23.592
I came here to help you understand
that when you finally do...

24:23.662 --> 24:25.493
you're gonna be okay.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.828
I'm gonna go. It's a long drive.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.470
-I'm glad you came.
-Yeah. Me, too.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.377
I miss you.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.700
So this is your ''A'' game, huh?

25:12.978 --> 25:15.446
You know what my Dad always told me?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.913
''Forget about practice.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.075
''As long as you come to play
on game day...

25:19.150 --> 25:20.640
''when the stakes are high...

25:20.719 --> 25:22.619
''odds are you'll come out a winner.''

25:22.687 --> 25:24.621
Last night was just a practice round.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.317
Since when are you taking advice
from your Dad?

25:27.392 --> 25:28.916
I know, right?

25:29.227 --> 25:32.663
But if there's one thing
he knows about, it's winning.

25:32.998 --> 25:36.126
Okay. So what are the stakes tonight?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.737
If I make this shot, we go upstairs.

25:42.607 --> 25:45.474
-And do what?
-Whatever I want.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.136
And if you miss?

25:48.647 --> 25:49.909
Let's go.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.391
I can't do this.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.769
-Because of Haley?
-No.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.929
Because of me.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.969
Haley called me...

26:18.543 --> 26:20.704
right after you left Austin.

26:21.479 --> 26:24.846
Were you planning on telling me this
before or after we had sex?

26:24.916 --> 26:27.350
We weren't gonna have sex, Nathan.

26:27.619 --> 26:31.214
I knew that. I was just waiting
for you to figure it out.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.991
So, what, you're like my guardian angel?

26:38.363 --> 26:40.695
No, it's not that. It's just....

26:42.167 --> 26:45.193
You're lost, and lonely.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.603
And I'm pretty good at making people
forget how lonely they really are.

26:48.673 --> 26:49.662
Right.

26:51.042 --> 26:54.739
That's a nice way of describing
what you're really good at.

26:57.148 --> 27:00.549
Sleep it off, Nathan.
You have a long drive tomorrow.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.019
What are you gonna do?

27:03.088 --> 27:05.215
Apparently, what I do best.

27:21.239 --> 27:23.173
Hey, Lucas. Come on in.

27:26.244 --> 27:28.735
I was just returning a book.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.542
What you got there?

27:31.383 --> 27:33.908
<i>The Hound of the Baskervilles.</i>
Sherlock Holmes.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.385
Since when are you a fan
of Arthur Conan Doyle?

27:36.454 --> 27:38.251
Since I can remember.

27:39.057 --> 27:42.049
Every kid wants to be Sherlock Holmes
at some point.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.392
Not me. I was always partial
to Professor Moriarty.

27:47.465 --> 27:51.367
-You do realize he was the villain?
-That's one interpretation.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.539
Thanks for letting me borrow it.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.583
Hey, Cinderella.

28:15.593 --> 28:18.494
-You hanging in there?
-I take it you've heard.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.224
My mom can crack the whip.

28:20.298 --> 28:24.325
I can't believe she actually grounded me.
I thought she liked me.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.297
Brooke, she does like you.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.135
She cares enough about you
to ground you.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.139
So, what number you up to? Three?

28:33.211 --> 28:35.475
Four. ''Mop the kitchen floor.''

28:37.382 --> 28:39.407
And you're using a sponge?

28:41.453 --> 28:42.943
Is that wrong?

28:47.592 --> 28:49.287
Okay, Brooke...

28:51.329 --> 28:52.819
this is a mop.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.733
Look, I'll tell you what, all right?

28:56.801 --> 28:58.826
You take the evens. I'll take the odds.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.100
I'll bet we can bust this out
in, like, half-hour.

29:02.874 --> 29:04.341
Thanks, Luke.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.737
Anything for you.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.249
Mom? Dad?

29:13.218 --> 29:14.981
You know I love you.

29:16.788 --> 29:20.224
But there's something
I have to tell you about myself.

29:24.662 --> 29:27.028
When I asked if we could move here...

29:27.098 --> 29:30.465
I told you it was
because I couldn't take the rumors.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.999
Really, I was just running away
from my life...

29:38.076 --> 29:39.668
from who I am...

29:42.080 --> 29:45.572
because the rumors...

29:48.787 --> 29:50.516
they were all true.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.090
I like girls.

29:56.027 --> 29:59.121
You've always taught me
to be proud of who I am.

29:59.597 --> 30:02.259
That's not so easy for me, because...

30:03.234 --> 30:05.930
I haven't been able to accept who I am.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.036
Until now.

30:14.112 --> 30:17.309
And I want you to know
that this is hard for me...

30:17.949 --> 30:22.181
because I love you so much,
and I never want to disappoint you.

30:24.088 --> 30:27.023
But I have to stop
disappointing myself, too.

30:30.028 --> 30:33.293
And I just hope you still love me.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.393
Hey, beautiful.

30:40.705 --> 30:43.003
I have to do something tonight.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.908
And I need you to know that I have
searched the bottom of my heart...

30:47.979 --> 30:52.313
and I truly believe
that this is the best thing for you, for us.

30:54.285 --> 30:58.016
I just hope that someday
you'll be able to understand that.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.657
Give me a kiss.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.554
You're leaving?

31:10.902 --> 31:12.028
Sorry, Peyton.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.697
-I'll go with you.
-No, you can't.

31:14.772 --> 31:17.707
-We can be together.
-Yeah, I wish we could.

31:19.310 --> 31:22.768
Then at least tell me
where you're going. Please.

31:23.815 --> 31:27.649
-Maybe I can help.
-I can't tell you right now.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.820
But I need you to know something.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.786
Look, I've never been happier
than when I'm with you.

31:33.858 --> 31:37.794
I have never felt this much of everything.

31:37.862 --> 31:41.127
And if I could,
I would stay with you here forever.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.327
But I just can't.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.511
You're the only person
I can truly count on.

31:56.014 --> 31:59.211
That's why I need you
to do one last thing for me.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.228
Sneaking away without saying goodbye.
That's original.

32:26.711 --> 32:29.271
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

32:30.915 --> 32:34.749
I'm really sorry, Taylor,
for what I said, how I acted.

32:35.353 --> 32:38.186
It's okay. You get one free pass with me.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.247
Next time, watch your back.

32:41.893 --> 32:45.090
-I had fun, though, before that.
-I know you did.

32:46.497 --> 32:49.591
After a while,
all the parties just blend together.

32:49.667 --> 32:53.194
-Sometimes I just wish I could start over.
-You can.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.932
We all can, right?

32:56.441 --> 32:59.410
Not me.
Once people think of you a certain way...

32:59.477 --> 33:02.844
you're never going to be able
to change their minds.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.116
I am who I am, and I have to live with that.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.249
But you, nobody's put a label on you yet.

33:10.054 --> 33:12.318
You can still be whoever you want to be.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.914
Without Haley.

33:15.727 --> 33:20.391
If she's not gonna be there for you,
you have to start being there for yourself.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.827
-I don't know if I can.
-You can. And you will.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.830
Just wake up every morning
and live your life.

33:32.043 --> 33:34.375
What happens if she comes back?

33:35.613 --> 33:37.808
Then it'll be your decision.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.521
Get home safe, Nathan.

33:46.424 --> 33:48.858
Try not to go dancing on any bars.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.723
I won't if you won't.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.427
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I'm Jake Jagielski.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.221
There's a warrant out for my arrest.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.074
Anna, what's up?

34:46.217 --> 34:47.809
I told my parents.

34:47.885 --> 34:50.478
You told them? That's huge!

34:51.556 --> 34:53.284
How'd they take it?

34:54.725 --> 34:58.525
I'm not sure, really. They cried a lot.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.498
But I think it was just because they were
trying to understand.

35:02.567 --> 35:06.003
Then, when I was finished,
they told me they loved me.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.130
Which is all I really wanted to hear.

35:10.208 --> 35:12.335
I am so proud of you, Anna.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.512
There's more.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.944
I told my parents that they always
taught me to be proud of myself.

35:20.151 --> 35:22.711
And the only way for me to do that...

35:22.787 --> 35:26.655
is if I go back to my boarding school
and finally be who I am.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.524
Does that mean you're leaving?

35:31.863 --> 35:32.921
Yes.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.301
I wanted to stop in and see Peyton...

35:38.369 --> 35:41.304
but she's got enough
to deal with right now.

35:41.372 --> 35:44.000
-Tell her I'll call her soon?
-I will.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.775
I am gonna miss you so much.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.013
-You've been a great friend.
-You, too.

35:59.190 --> 36:02.057
I'm a better person for knowing you, Luke.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.734
How about one last game of horse?

36:12.036 --> 36:13.833
That sounds perfect.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.719
Tell me you love me.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.792
And tell me you did not just touch
that half-eaten bagel.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.386
No, I don't. Yes, I did.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.761
And why are you waving
that thing around in my face?

36:41.832 --> 36:44.892
It happens to be an invitation
to the biggest party of the year.

36:44.969 --> 36:48.336
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.
And for the record, there have been, like...

36:48.406 --> 36:51.671
six ''biggest parties of the year''
this month, so get a new rating system.

36:51.742 --> 36:54.302
-But this one is a ''can't miss.''
-And so was the last one.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.573
No. The last one was a ''shouldn't miss.''

36:56.647 --> 37:00.276
Just look at the invitation
and I won't say another word.

37:00.918 --> 37:02.852
This is a Courtney Ryan party.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.081
-This is a ''can't miss.''
-Told you.

37:05.156 --> 37:09.058
The party starts at, like, 9:00,
so meet us there around 11:30?

37:09.460 --> 37:12.190
And, Brooke, welcome back.

37:24.609 --> 37:25.769
Lucas.

37:28.446 --> 37:29.811
Come on in.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.008
What's all this?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.484
I thought it was time
to upgrade the security system.

37:35.553 --> 37:38.818
Too many people know the pass code
to the main alarm.

37:38.889 --> 37:41.449
-That's a good idea.
-Besides, outside the family...

37:41.525 --> 37:44.426
you never know
who you can trust these days.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.959
I got you something.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.863
I thought you'd like it
since you're into Sherlock Holmes.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.464
I marked my favorite story for you.

38:01.345 --> 38:04.473
-Have you read that one?
-Yeah, a long time ago.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.880
It wasn't very popular with the fans...

38:06.951 --> 38:09.715
but I think
it's some of Doyle's most honest work.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.311
And why's that?

38:11.956 --> 38:14.550
Because he wrote what he was feeling.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.524
He got tired of writing that character.
The snoop.

38:19.196 --> 38:22.131
AII the sneaking around, all the deception.

38:23.334 --> 38:26.531
But he knew when it was time to end it.
That's why, in the end...

38:26.604 --> 38:28.868
the great Sherlock Holmes
falls to his death.

38:28.939 --> 38:31.100
-I think maybe you missed the point.
-Did I?

38:31.175 --> 38:33.200
When Sherlock Holmes falls off the cliff...

38:33.277 --> 38:36.110
he pulls Professor Moriarty
down with him.

38:37.915 --> 38:39.177
You see?

38:39.250 --> 38:42.344
He sacrificed himself
to bring down the bad guy.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.352
That's the point
I think Doyle was trying to make.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.026
Like I said, that's one interpretation.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.059
Lucas.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.067
I'll be seeing you.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.386
Ready?

39:30.501 --> 39:34.460
Jake Jagielski, you have the right
to remain silent.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.641
Ma'am, we have a warrant
to search the property.

39:40.711 --> 39:44.408
<i>Anything you say</i>
<i>may be used against you in a court of law.</i>

39:46.550 --> 39:48.108
<i>You have the right...</i>

39:48.185 --> 39:51.586
<i>to have an attorney present</i>
<i>during questioning, now, or in the future.</i>

39:51.655 --> 39:55.557
<i>lf you cannot afford an attorney,</i>
<i>one will be appointed to you.</i>

39:55.626 --> 39:59.460
Do you understand your rights
as I have explained them to you?

40:01.198 --> 40:02.290
I do.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.540
Brooke, you're home.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.976
Yeah, I'm grounded. Remember?

40:18.048 --> 40:21.484
Not anymore.
I think you've learned your lesson.

41:10.234 --> 41:13.226
<i>You have one new message.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:14.896
<i>Nathan, it's me.</i>

41:15.439 --> 41:18.067
<i>I just needed to call</i>
<i>because I want you to--</i>

41:18.142 --> 41:20.133
<i>Message has been erased.</i>

41:53.344 --> 41:55.141
Why didn't you tell me?

41:55.212 --> 41:57.510
I knew you'd talk me out of it.

41:59.617 --> 42:01.278
So, where's Jenny?

42:02.720 --> 42:04.085
She's safe.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.462
I love you.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.225
I love you, too.

43:25.202 --> 43:26.191
