Then who are you?

12:36.966 --> 12:38.534
What did you do for him?

12:39.568 --> 12:42.971
I helped him out, I...
You know, I fixed problems.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.041
Yeah, you being honest now?

12:46.375 --> 12:48.510
I am.

12:48.511 --> 12:50.445
And you had the balls
to question me?

12:52.248 --> 12:53.648
You know,
if you're so close to them,

12:53.649 --> 12:54.949
why don't you
ask him yourself?

12:54.950 --> 12:57.051
Ask him what?
Does he want you dead?

12:57.052 --> 12:58.853
If Marty Stein is behind this,

12:58.854 --> 13:02.094
the best thing we got going for us is
that he doesn't know that we know.

13:02.758 --> 13:05.360
Listen, just...
Just hold on a second.

13:05.361 --> 13:07.428
Believe me, when I tell you,

13:07.429 --> 13:09.697
you don't show
Marty Stein your cards.

13:09.698 --> 13:11.533
You don't show him shit.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.801
I know the man.

13:13.802 --> 13:15.470
And I know how to play him.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.424
When was this found?

13:36.425 --> 13:38.159
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand back, ma'am.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.962
I'm DEA. Where are the forensics?
They should be all over this.

13:40.963 --> 13:42.297
What? Who are you?

13:42.298 --> 13:43.932
Did you hear me?

13:43.933 --> 13:45.667
ID, Ms. DEA?

13:46.569 --> 13:48.903
Shit, I left it at home.
Dispatch just called me

13:48.904 --> 13:50.772
to tell me they found
Detective Finnegan's car.

13:50.773 --> 13:52.975
We were partners
on the gang task force.

13:56.245 --> 13:57.946
Can you call...

13:57.947 --> 13:59.448
Call who?

14:11.193 --> 14:13.695
- LOWRY: Lowry.
- They found his car.

14:13.696 --> 14:15.363
Yeah, I know.

14:15.364 --> 14:17.432
I'm here now.
No forensics, nothing.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.234
No one but some beat cop.

14:19.235 --> 14:21.436
They're on top of it, Deakins, okay?
They'll be there soon enough.

14:21.437 --> 14:24.339
Just... Just let them
do their job, all right?

14:25.107 --> 14:26.742
Yeah.

14:30.479 --> 14:32.314
Come on, pick a card.

14:36.252 --> 14:38.887
All right.

14:38.888 --> 14:41.556
Go on, now, put that card
back on the top of the pile.

14:41.824 --> 14:43.592
Not looking.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.162
Magic...

14:49.398 --> 14:52.267
- Is that your card?
- No.

14:52.268 --> 14:53.968
No, hmm?

14:53.969 --> 14:55.570
All right.

14:56.505 --> 14:58.773
What about this one,
is that your card?

14:58.774 --> 15:01.076
- Nope.
- No?

15:02.578 --> 15:04.179
All right.

15:06.882 --> 15:08.349
Dude, that's your card, right?

15:08.350 --> 15:10.519
No. Mine was the 5 of hearts.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.887
Five of hearts?

15:12.888 --> 15:14.489
That was the card.

15:14.723 --> 15:16.425
Wait, so...

15:17.927 --> 15:19.594
You mean that five of hearts?

15:21.130 --> 15:24.399
- How'd you do that?
- I'm a... I'm a genius.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.268
ETHAN: Marlon,
you got a minute?

15:28.570 --> 15:30.639
- What's going on, kid?
- 'Sup.

15:31.307 --> 15:33.074
Can you give us a minute?

15:33.075 --> 15:36.444
Look... (CLEARS THROAT) Why don't
you go in the house and play, okay?

15:36.445 --> 15:37.912
Then I'll show you
how I did the trick.

15:37.913 --> 15:39.414
But I'm not gonna
say anything.

15:39.415 --> 15:41.015
I know you're not, 'cause
you're gonna be in the house.

15:41.016 --> 15:42.651
- (DOOR CREAKING)
- Come on.

15:43.285 --> 15:44.686
Thank you.

15:44.687 --> 15:46.655
(ETHAN GRUNTS)

15:51.327 --> 15:53.695
So let's get this done.
His mom will be back soon.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.699
You ever hear the name
Greg Barrett?

15:57.933 --> 15:59.701
No. Why?

15:59.702 --> 16:01.302
He's Marty's financial
advisor, or one of them.

16:01.303 --> 16:04.572
I know you guys moved
a lot of money together.

16:04.573 --> 16:06.908
Greg hired me
to find Mia, Marlon.

16:07.710 --> 16:10.479
Whoa, you think
I'm in on Marty's thing?

16:12.014 --> 16:14.949
- Bro, you came to me.
- No...

16:14.950 --> 16:17.952
Marty was pretty keen on me
putting you on the books.

16:17.953 --> 16:19.687
Why is that?

16:19.688 --> 16:21.790
Keep an eye on me?
Report back to him?

16:22.458 --> 16:24.092
And then Greg comes to me,

16:24.093 --> 16:26.961
Marty sends him my way
but he doesn't tell me?

16:26.962 --> 16:30.565
And then I learn that
maybe Marty's behind all this?

16:31.734 --> 16:34.235
The timing's pretty tight, Marlon.
Pretty fucking tight.

16:34.236 --> 16:37.839
You know what, I don't know, but, uh,
Marty does not have me working you.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.274
Well, I'm asking because
I wanna know.

16:40.275 --> 16:42.076
Last time I saw Marty,

16:42.077 --> 16:44.112
I put him in the trunk
of my car.

16:44.113 --> 16:46.248
I almost took that
motherfucker out.

16:48.225 --> 16:51.019
I'm with Marty. Man,
what do you want?

16:51.020 --> 16:54.589
If Marty's behind this, then
that's a fucking problem for me.

16:54.590 --> 16:56.224
And I'm gonna go after him.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.693
Doesn't that
make you happy, Marlon?

16:58.694 --> 17:00.562
I don't... (CLEARS THROAT)

17:00.762 --> 17:03.564
I tapped out about, like,
six hours ago on your shit.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.800
Come on, I watched you at the
auto-body shop. You're good at this.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.570
Maybe even
enjoyed it a little bit.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.540
You know what? I'm good
at selling lights, man.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.441
But you want to see me
doing that, either, right?

17:14.442 --> 17:16.577
I'm done. Go home.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.512
Hey, hold on a second. Word on the
street is that you need some money.

17:19.513 --> 17:21.281
Here, take this.

17:22.317 --> 17:24.117
Look, there's a lot more
where that came from.

17:24.118 --> 17:27.354
But I gotta know that Marty's
not pulling strings, Marlon.

17:27.355 --> 17:31.059
See, a part of you don't wanna believe
that he would do that to you.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.194
Yeah, you're right about that.

17:34.195 --> 17:35.930
Yeah, he's the weed, man.

Choking the root of the tree.
Sucking the life right out of it.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.601
No matter how much
you cut him down,

17:40.602 --> 17:43.103
he's gonna keep coming back until he
takes the whole motherfucker down.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.272
- So help me, Marlon.
- No, I don't wanna help you.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.041
You know what,
don't give a shit then.

17:47.042 --> 17:48.843
But at least take my money.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.499
Did you hear me? There's more
where that came from, Marlon.

17:58.386 --> 18:00.186
You know who wants it
more than you?

18:00.789 --> 18:02.856

18:05.360 --> 18:07.094

against Marty.

She's the one. She's got
all the resources behind her.

18:09.698 --> 18:11.432
- Hmm.
- But right now...

18:11.433 --> 18:13.501

She's suspended.

- She needs a little help.
- Maybe she does.

doing this shit, man.

- Hey.
- Hey.

a coffee or something?

18:59.864 --> 19:01.665
No, no, I can't stay.

19:04.902 --> 19:07.104
It's bad news, isn't it?

19:07.738 --> 19:09.640

19:10.441 --> 19:11.808

19:11.809 --> 19:14.544

anything for sure yet.

on that deed.

bad thing I don't get it back.

some great memories there, right?

have, like, six flights of stairs?

I should exercise more.

to where we were.

I'm sure he's fine.
He's probably stowed up

21:23.841 --> 21:26.643
in some motel in French Lick with some
chick he met at a Blackjack table.

21:26.644 --> 21:28.745
Without his car?

this guy was kicked off the task force.

21:31.482 --> 21:33.550
"This guy"?
His name is Patrick.

to say it.

okay?

Well, he's a big boy. He can
handle himself. You know that.

21:51.302 --> 21:52.903
I shouldn't have pushed it.

to keep me informed, though.

with Stein.

Well, goddamn it, Deakins, why
would he be in trouble with him?

24:33.530 --> 24:36.399
When he was on the task force,
he was...

24:36.400 --> 24:39.502
- He was kind of playing both sides.
- Both sides of what?

24:39.503 --> 24:44.440
He was playing Stein to get
information posing as a dirty cop.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.976
No, I didn't authorize any
undercover work for Patrick.

24:46.977 --> 24:48.711

easy on yourself, are you?

eat this shit right up.

what happens to me,

Patrick's disappearance...

25:04.061 --> 25:05.795

did Patrick get?

25:05.796 --> 25:07.531

lying to me, Deakins.

25:10.494 --> 25:11.583
Yes!

25:11.708 --> 25:12.708
Did you know he was playing

25:12.710 --> 25:13.870
- both sides?
- No.

25:13.871 --> 25:16.339
So there wasn't any undercover
operation for me to authorize.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.640
- Is that right?
- That's right.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.475
So, what happened?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.611
I found out during
our investigation.

25:21.612 --> 25:23.313
And you protected him.

25:23.914 --> 25:25.715
Yep.

25:25.716 --> 25:28.785
Yeah, I don't think
you're gonna survive IA.

25:28.786 --> 25:31.154
Finnegan, he sure
as hell ain't.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.356
Well, there is a time
for all of that.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.857
When did you last see him?

25:34.858 --> 25:36.492
The night before last,
around 11:00,

25:36.493 --> 25:38.562
he went to speak to Marty
to help me.

25:39.563 --> 25:41.264
And then they both
disappeared.

25:41.398 --> 25:42.965
(SCOFFS)

25:42.966 --> 25:45.635
Okay, so you think that Stein found
out that he was playing him?

25:45.636 --> 25:47.737
I don't know, it's possible.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.539
Oh, shit.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.941
I need my badge.

25:51.942 --> 25:55.112
I wanna help find him but I can't
do anything while I'm suspended.

25:55.979 --> 25:57.614
That's not up to me, Deakins.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.584
That's not in my hands.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.224
I will go down to CPD and see
what I can find out for you.

26:13.063 --> 26:14.698
But you...

26:15.999 --> 26:18.134
You won't do a damn thing.

26:18.969 --> 26:20.737
Are we clear?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.273
Yes, sir.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.377
- What do you want?
- I may have something for you.

27:01.378 --> 27:03.112
Something on my partner?

27:03.113 --> 27:05.248
No, no. I'm sorry about that.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.918
You know, how do I put this?

27:08.919 --> 27:11.888
I think our interests have
temporarily aligned.

27:12.389 --> 27:14.357
- Yours and mine?
- Yeah.

27:14.358 --> 27:16.159
I seriously doubt that.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.494
I just wanna find Finnegan.

27:18.495 --> 27:20.396
His car was found
down by the docks.

27:20.397 --> 27:22.298
Burnt out. Window bashed in.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.733
Yeah, I don't know
anything about that.

27:23.734 --> 27:26.035
No, of course you don't. You
know nothing about Patrick.

27:26.036 --> 27:27.703
Nothing about
Greg Barrett's murder.

27:27.704 --> 27:29.472
Greg Barrett is
a different story.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.908
What? What do you know?

27:31.909 --> 27:35.044
Well, I didn't kill him but I might
be able to give you the man who did.

27:35.045 --> 27:37.113
And you're just gonna
give that to me?

27:37.114 --> 27:40.034
You know what? I want you to think
of me as a concerned citizen.

27:40.817 --> 27:42.952
How do you know this?

27:42.953 --> 27:46.323
How do you guys put it? I have
a confidential informant.

27:48.859 --> 27:50.493
Jesus, Kelly.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.196
- What's your play here?
- Listen...

27:53.197 --> 27:56.277
Do you want my help or do you want
to stand around asking questions?

27:57.467 --> 27:59.069
Here.

28:04.007 --> 28:06.742
- Whose address is this?
- Check it out.

28:06.743 --> 28:09.813
I'm not gonna go
to some address you give me.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.581
You're setting me up?

28:11.582 --> 28:13.783
You're a smart girl.
You figure it out.

28:13.784 --> 28:15.785
(PHONE RINGING)

28:18.121 --> 28:20.056
(SIGHS) Hey.

28:20.057 --> 28:23.059
Ethan, I need your help.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.694
- Where are you?
- JENNIFER: Don't touch me.

28:24.695 --> 28:26.162
Jen, what's going on?

28:26.163 --> 28:28.698
There's a gun being held
to my head.

28:28.699 --> 28:30.266
They want Vasily or I'm dead.

28:30.267 --> 28:31.567
Okay, tell me where you are.

28:31.568 --> 28:33.336
Just bring, Vasily, please.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.438
You bring Vasily to me
or she's dead.

28:35.439 --> 28:36.642
Who is this?

28:37.037 --> 28:38.290
If you don't being him to me,

28:38.291 --> 28:40.291
I'm gonna come after you
after I'm gonna kill her.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.545
Call this number
when you're on the way.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.248
- Hey, don't you fucking...
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)

28:47.885 --> 28:50.754
- Is there a problem?
- It's nothing I can't handle.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.602
Mia, I'm not abandoning her.
You hear me?

29:09.139 --> 29:10.874
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

29:11.875 --> 29:14.710
You are going to get
yourself killed.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.551
What is that gonna
achieve then, huh?

29:18.615 --> 29:20.383
You don't owe her.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.290
You know there's no such thing as
absolution for people like us?

29:27.291 --> 29:29.571
What is that supposed to mean?
"People like us"?

29:30.027 --> 29:31.994
You know what I mean.

29:31.995 --> 29:34.463
Maybe people like us are the ones
that should be trying their hardest.

29:34.464 --> 29:36.866
We are dealing with
the Russian mob here, Ethan.

29:36.867 --> 29:38.334
I know who we are
talking about.

29:38.335 --> 29:39.969
You shot one of them,
remember?

29:44.107 --> 29:45.675
Okay.

29:47.444 --> 29:49.345
You care for Jen.

29:49.346 --> 29:51.447
Loyalty is
an admirable quality,

29:51.448 --> 29:53.382
if distinctly over-rated.

29:53.383 --> 29:55.384
Well, I'm glad to hear
you think that way.

29:55.385 --> 29:57.119
Oh, excuse me.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.021
But her uncle
tried to kill me and you

29:59.022 --> 30:00.690
and she helped him.
Are you forgetting that?

30:00.691 --> 30:02.191
She had no choice.

30:02.192 --> 30:04.060
She had a choice
and she didn't choose us!

30:04.061 --> 30:06.762
I sent her to Vasily.
You understand?

30:06.763 --> 30:08.664
I'm the one
that put her in this shit.

30:08.665 --> 30:10.333
Yeah, well, as long as
they're looking for Vasily,

30:10.334 --> 30:12.001
they're not looking for me.

30:12.002 --> 30:14.037
Wow. (CHUCKLES)

30:14.571 --> 30:16.005
Wow.

30:16.006 --> 30:17.874
You're cold, Mia.

30:20.877 --> 30:23.213
- I'm just stating facts.
- Hmm.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.449
Look, this isn't
Fallujah, Ethan.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.319
You can't just break down their
door and go in, guns blazing.

30:31.054 --> 30:32.789
(SIGHS)

30:34.257 --> 30:36.559
You can either help me or not.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.995
It's your choice.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.235
I'm all ears.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.756
You can't just
be showing up, man.

31:07.557 --> 31:09.125
I thought you
enjoyed working for me.

31:09.126 --> 31:12.361
MARLON: I don't work for anyone, Ethan.
Especially not you.

31:12.361 --> 31:13.830
Shit. There I was thinking
maybe we could go

31:13.831 --> 31:15.264
into business together,
Marlon.

31:15.265 --> 31:17.366
Uh-huh. Make this quick.

31:17.367 --> 31:20.136
 My lady thinks I'm
bein' helpful around the house.

31:20.137 --> 31:21.871
How well do you know
the Russians?

31:21.872 --> 31:25.141
We did some business together.
Why? This about Marty?

31:25.142 --> 31:27.076
No, they kidnapped the girl
that works for me.

31:27.077 --> 31:29.145
Shit. You're having
a bad day, man.

31:29.146 --> 31:31.447
They want Vasily before
they release her.

31:31.448 --> 31:33.416
Well, we know that
ain't gonna happen.

31:33.417 --> 31:35.285
Suppose I make a play for her?

31:35.952 --> 31:37.587
I'd say you're fucked.

31:38.455 --> 31:40.295
There's gotta be
another way, Marlon.

31:41.758 --> 31:43.292
You got something they want?

31:43.293 --> 31:47.397
If you do, still 50-50
you see your friend again.

31:49.399 --> 31:50.900
She's all I have to trade.

31:54.171 --> 31:55.871
You are a cold blooded
motherfucker.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.773
Maybe. Maybe.

31:57.774 --> 31:59.408
- But I need you.
- I'm busy.

31:59.409 --> 32:00.844
Ten grand busy?

32:02.712 --> 32:05.248
20 grand and
I clear my schedule.

32:05.582 --> 32:07.684
(INHALES) Fine.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.658
(DISTANT SIRENS)

32:28.839 --> 32:30.372
You sure you can trust Kelly?

32:30.373 --> 32:32.741
He's not stupid enough
to send us into an ambush.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.312
Only two things are infinite, the
universe and human stupidity,

32:36.313 --> 32:38.447
I'm not sure about the former.

32:38.448 --> 32:41.617
- Einstein.
- He's my go-to guy.

32:41.618 --> 32:44.453
- No, no. You stay right here.
- Fuck that.

32:44.454 --> 32:46.455
Please sit your ass
in the car.

32:46.456 --> 32:48.416
Don't make me regret
bringing you along.

32:56.199 --> 32:57.833

LOWRY: Got something
over here.

to stay in the car?

is one Vasily Anatov.

What do you mean?
You called me.

Did you kill him?

(SCOFFS) Come on,
you can't really think that.

35:12.135 --> 35:13.469
Vasily killed Barrett.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.171
And you know that how?

Uh, it's an educated guess.

Vasily was dead?

about the storage locker?

- Oh, a misunderstanding?
- Yeah.

We were speculating about two regular
people having a drink at a bar.

help you with IA,

it's not gonna
get you your badge back.

36:50.867 --> 36:55.070
But do you know what you need?
You need something bigger.

36:55.071 --> 36:57.873
What if I was to give you
some gangsters? Hmm?

36:57.874 --> 37:01.511

your little task force, isn't it?

- Mmm-hmm.

you a big win.

- Yeah, I mean it.

don't change his spots

don't change his ways.

ain't this man.

Eli to the zoo this Saturday.

- Yeah?

Okay. Then I'll get Crystal
to watch him

- What we gonna do, Nae Nae?

you know that?

secrets stay secret.

38:32.368 --> 38:34.536
Sounds boring.

38:34.537 --> 38:36.639
Somebody's gotta pay
for those zoo tickets.

38:40.243 --> 38:42.845
- Try not to be too late.
- MARLON: I won't.

38:44.047 --> 38:45.481
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:53.690 --> 38:55.224
Turtle Island.

38:55.925 --> 38:58.594
- Where's that?
- It's in Fiji.

38:58.595 --> 39:00.296
ETHAN: Oh, I know where it is.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.998
I saw it on
the Travel Channel.

39:02.999 --> 39:06.202
You stay in these little huts
in the forest. Private beach.

39:08.905 --> 39:11.225
That's where I want to go
when this is over with.

39:11.341 --> 39:13.209
Just you and me.

39:15.545 --> 39:19.081
Listen, I wanna thank you for doing
what you're doing. I appreciate it.

39:31.694 --> 39:34.764
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39:35.598 --> 39:37.132
You think this is gonna work?

39:37.133 --> 39:39.335
There's only
one way to find out.

39:46.409 --> 39:49.578
Listen, my boy Peaches
used to sling over by 17th.

39:49.579 --> 39:50.846
Peaches? Who do you mean?

39:50.847 --> 39:53.248
Yeah. You know, like, balls.

39:53.249 --> 39:55.450
- Peaches.
- (ETHAN CHUCKLES)

39:55.451 --> 39:59.354
So this junkie...
Stringy blond, blue-eyes,

39:59.355 --> 40:01.690
fine if she ever took a bath.

40:01.691 --> 40:05.427
She wants Peaches to sell her an eight
ball, but she ain't got no cash.

40:05.428 --> 40:06.695
After a little give and take,

40:06.696 --> 40:10.032
she's on her knees
in the alley behind Luther's.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.633
Now the deal was,

40:11.634 --> 40:14.102
she got her eight ball, but she
was supposed to pay Peaches

40:14.103 --> 40:16.238
the full throw the next day.

40:16.239 --> 40:19.442
Once again, ladies, getting on your
knees is complete waste of time.

40:21.344 --> 40:22.778
Well that's just interest.

40:22.779 --> 40:24.880
Oh, Jesus Christ.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.215
MARLON: So he goes
to her crib to collect.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.953
Turns out that she is
Viktor's baby sister.

40:31.688 --> 40:33.956
Now Viktor is one
of our Russian friends.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.759
Viktor plucks out
Peaches' eyeballs on account.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.594
He just wanted to get
what was owed him.

40:39.595 --> 40:40.762
Let me ask you
something Marlon.

40:40.763 --> 40:42.798
Does any of your stories
end up happily?

40:42.799 --> 40:44.867
Just so we all know
what we're facing.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.570
Yeah, this...
This looks like it.

41:20.703 --> 41:22.171
Your weapons.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.439
And I wouldn't try
running if I were you.

41:28.177 --> 41:29.879
Get their weapons.

41:31.214 --> 41:33.883
Hands up. Up, up, up.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.927
Where's the girl?

41:45.928 --> 41:47.596
With Viktor. In the barn.

41:55.071 --> 41:56.472
You fucking liar!

41:59.208 --> 42:04.112
He didn't tell you?
Ignorance is a bliss, friend.

42:04.113 --> 42:05.680
What the fuck is happening?

42:05.681 --> 42:07.641
Just shut up
and listen to what he says.

42:07.817 --> 42:09.285
GRIGORY: Thank you.

42:11.587 --> 42:14.056
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

42:14.057 --> 42:16.492
Now, let's go to the barn
for exchange.

42:17.393 --> 42:18.660
You're giving me to them?

42:18.661 --> 42:19.995
I had no choice, Mia.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.564
Move.

42:24.467 --> 42:26.435
I can make you very rich.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.603
Keep walking.

42:28.604 --> 42:31.139
Whatever you want,
I can get you.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.677
She said the same thing to me.
Unfortunately, I fell for it.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.179
Who wouldn't?

42:37.980 --> 42:41.049
All the money you want,
I can get you. And more.

42:41.050 --> 42:43.419
- Jesus Christ, Mia.
- Let her talk.

42:44.987 --> 42:47.423
Why be a soldier
when you can be a general?

42:48.624 --> 42:50.593
How would I know
you won't fuck me?

42:51.194 --> 42:52.828
(CHUCKLES) Oh,
she'll fuck you.

42:52.829 --> 42:54.429
And it will almost
be worth it.

42:56.632 --> 42:58.067
Almost?

42:59.969 --> 43:02.505
Keep moving. Get inside.

43:04.407 --> 43:06.342
Follow Nikolai,
get into the barn.

43:14.817 --> 43:16.452
Hey, keep moving.

43:17.019 --> 43:18.487
Not until I see Jen first.

43:18.488 --> 43:20.055
She's okay.

43:20.056 --> 43:22.224
And you're not in position
to negotiate, my friend.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.660
Maybe. But I'm not moving
until I see her.

(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

43:44.013 --> 43:45.447
You see?

43:46.549 --> 43:48.050
As good as new.

43:48.985 --> 43:50.419
You okay, Jen?

43:51.921 --> 43:53.656
- Bring her to me.
- No.

43:55.658 --> 43:57.058
No?

43:57.059 --> 44:00.529
No, unfortunately, we don't do
it this way. We take them both.

44:00.530 --> 44:02.865
- Excuse me?
- We take them both.

44:05.635 --> 44:08.136
- That wasn't the deal.
- GRIGORY: No, I know.

44:08.137 --> 44:10.172
But we are fucking the deal.

44:10.173 --> 44:12.908
You can stay,
or you can leave.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.379
That was a joke, my friend.

44:19.182 --> 44:21.383

I'm afraid.
