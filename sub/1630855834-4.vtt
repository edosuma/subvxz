Just this.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.211
Don't feel sorry for me.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.254
Time to rebuild and reconquer.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.882
If I know one thing
about myself,

20:18.009 --> 20:21.594
Montgomery burns always
bounces back.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.332
We also have over 90 hours of
them talking about umbrellas.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.875
Maybe that could be
a documentary, too.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.128
I once brought an umbrella
into the shower.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.214
-How did you get clean?
-I didn't,

20:58.299 --> 21:01.384
But at least I didn't
have to take off my clothes.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.720
As soon as I open my umbrella,
it stops raining.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.389
You need a sunroof on it.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.517
What about a giant umbrella
you keep in the trunk?

21:09.644 --> 21:13.479
Sounds like you're talking about
an "umbrellaphant."

21:13.523 --> 21:15.273
Can we get back to work?

21:15.316 --> 21:17.316
Wait. I like the sound of that.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.401
Get back.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.528
I saw an umbrellaphant
at the circus.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.488
He was working for peanuts.
