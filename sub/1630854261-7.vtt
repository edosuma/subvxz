[Chuckles]

01:12.906 --> 01:15.158
So tell me about
New York.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.912
It was amazing.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.748
Dr. Pace really does know
everyone in the industry,

01:21.790 --> 01:23.958
and it was really,
really exciting

01:24.000 --> 01:25.960
talking to dancers who are
all actually doing it.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.004
Well, it sounds great.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.256
And if you got extra,
I could use a little
bit of that energy.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.634
Aren't you on, like,
a winning streak right now?

01:32.675 --> 01:35.678
I am, but my tennis curse
is about to kick in,

01:35.720 --> 01:37.180
so there's that.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.890
Your what, now?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.559
I have never won more than
6 matches in a row.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.813
Something or someone
always derails me.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.524
Case in point:
my history assignment is

01:47.565 --> 01:51.277
to write about a historical
figure's biggest
moment of integrity,

01:51.319 --> 01:53.822
and I have no idea
who to write it on.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.366
OK, well, that's not
a curse.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.701
It's called being
a college student.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.162
Well, then there's boy drama
between Damon and Lando.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.331
Again, not a curse.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.999

being Simone Hicks.

Ooh. You ain't right.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.128
Look, I'm sorry.
The truth hurts.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.755
Damon thinks that Lando
filmed his Hawkins practice

02:10.797 --> 02:12.799
and leaked it to the press.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.677
He says that I should
be careful about who
I'm spending time with.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.471
Look, I think that
you need to remove
all distractions.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.224
So get help
on your project,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.310
ask Lando what's good
on being a snitch,

02:24.352 --> 02:26.896
and then the Damon thing
will sort itself out.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.023
Y'all are annoying
like that.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.499
It's gonna be
the perfect weekend.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.918

standing in the way is

02:48.960 --> 02:50.545
one little practice.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.297
And seeing Lando.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.382
I still can't believe you
haven't confronted him

02:54.424 --> 02:56.759
about leaking that video.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.970
Look...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.639

and...

03:01.681 --> 03:04.225
it is just a rumor.

published,

we wouldn't be playing.

be feeling the pressure
personally.

cuts happened at the end
of the semester.

Um...

honestly, I would say
that I was going through
some personal stuff,

13:15.169 --> 13:18.506
and it took me leaving
Bringston to realize

13:18.547 --> 13:22.009
how much I needed it
and how important it was
for me to come back.

wanted to be a reporter.

a little bit more serious

wanted to talk to you.
