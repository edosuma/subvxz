00:47.794 --> 00:51.521
Go back! Go back to your filthy wharf!

00:53.860 --> 00:57.070
That's it! Tell 'em what for, boys!

00:57.724 --> 01:01.531
Go back to the wharf!
We don't want you here!

01:06.410 --> 01:10.238
That's it! Tell 'em what for,
boys! Get out of here then!

01:10.267 --> 01:14.373
Go back to wherever you come
from or we'll send you packing!

01:14.406 --> 01:16.578
No more Jews!

01:16.614 --> 01:19.816
No more Jews! No more Jews!

01:20.140 --> 01:22.220
You throw that, you'll be
spending the night in jail.

01:22.252 --> 01:24.984
Send them back! Send them back!

01:25.016 --> 01:26.852
Stop! Get him!

01:33.357 --> 01:36.477
- Get over here!
- That's it, fellas, yes!

01:37.836 --> 01:40.928
Come on, fellas! Let them have it!

01:55.764 --> 01:57.554
Why are you arresting my men?

01:57.679 --> 01:59.667
It's our right to protest.

01:59.685 --> 02:01.987
Take it up with my inspector, not me.

02:08.222 --> 02:09.592
John, look!

02:09.650 --> 02:11.931
- It's the Jolson Brothers!
- Who?

02:12.217 --> 02:13.645
You don't know who the Jolson Broth...

02:13.656 --> 02:16.814
They're the hottest act
in Vaudeville! Come on.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.951
Shouldn't we keep an
eye on things out here?

02:21.447 --> 02:23.630
I think we've done our job
already, wouldn't you say?

02:33.015 --> 02:35.507
- Two tickets to the show?
- Yes, please.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.179

04:31.695 --> 04:33.980
Oh, thank you, Harry!

04:34.394 --> 04:35.767
You're on, Harry.

04:38.456 --> 04:41.551
Good evening, folks. Thrilled
to be here in Toronto.

04:41.569 --> 04:43.706
- To... To-ron... Toronto.
- That was the beautiful

04:43.734 --> 04:45.793
and talented Charlotte Hanson.

04:45.871 --> 04:48.510
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

04:48.538 --> 04:52.121
the brothers who are
taking America by storm:

04:52.190 --> 04:55.880
Harry and Al Jolson!

04:58.072 --> 05:01.024
Al! Al, get back here! We're on!

05:05.211 --> 05:06.842
Good evening, folks!

05:06.967 --> 05:09.155
Thrilled to be here in Toronto!

05:09.164 --> 05:11.255
A fine, fine town!

05:11.380 --> 05:13.445
Out on the street, a bum says to me,

05:13.478 --> 05:15.328
"Give me a dollar till payday, will ya?"

05:15.351 --> 05:17.123
And I ask, "When's payday?"

05:17.151 --> 05:19.730
And he says, "I don't know,
you're the one who's working!"

05:21.333 --> 05:23.197
But my brother, Al,

05:23.364 --> 05:25.757
him, I wish he'd learn a trade,

05:25.790 --> 05:27.953
so I'd knew what kind
of work he's out of.

05:28.805 --> 05:30.472
I thought you said these guys were good.

05:30.486 --> 05:32.420
It's supposed to be a doubles act.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.801
Come on, bring out Al?

05:33.820 --> 05:35.709
- Yeah!
- OK. Ahem!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.349
An old Jewish gentleman

05:37.391 --> 05:39.738
got knocked over by a horse and buggy.

05:39.863 --> 05:41.526
A constable rushed over,

05:41.563 --> 05:43.742
put his jacket under the old gent's head

05:43.776 --> 05:46.067
and asked, "Are you comfortable, sir?"

05:46.192 --> 05:48.204
And the old man shrugged and said...

05:48.227 --> 05:52.505
"I'm not rich, but I make
a living!" Hello, folks!

05:52.588 --> 05:54.771

06:01.072 --> 06:04.207
So, Al, I heard last week
you weren't feeling too good,

06:04.217 --> 06:06.123
- you went to see the doctor.
- Yeah, Harry.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.712
- I let him examine me.
- And what did the doctor have to say?

06:08.744 --> 06:11.743
"Mr. Jolson, I'm afraid you
have only six months to live.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.143
Now that'll be $10."

06:13.208 --> 06:15.843
"$10," I said. "I can't afford $10!"

06:15.875 --> 06:18.444
"Alright," the doctor says,
"I'll give you twelve months."

06:25.676 --> 06:28.444
- What happened?
- Is this part of the... ?

06:40.212 --> 06:42.500
It's a great deal of blood
for such a small wound.

06:42.671 --> 06:46.138
Indeed. It's possible the
abdominal aorta was lacerated.

06:46.143 --> 06:48.139
That would explain the volume of blood.

06:48.173 --> 06:50.320
And the amount of time
between the victim's stabbing

06:50.334 --> 06:51.552
and his actual death?

06:51.677 --> 06:54.106
The rate of blood loss
suggests a rapid death,

06:54.120 --> 06:56.796
but I'd have to examine the
body to be more specific.

06:56.823 --> 06:58.250
Of course.

06:59.817 --> 07:02.056
Have we established
the victim's identity?

07:02.650 --> 07:05.354
His name was Abraham Michaelson,
sir. He owned this building.

07:05.565 --> 07:07.647
Right. No one is to leave here.

07:07.675 --> 07:09.913
I'd like you to begin
questioning all of the performers.

07:09.927 --> 07:11.152
Right away.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.139
Where does this trail
of blood originate?

07:13.142 --> 07:15.200
It starts in the alleyway, sir.

07:18.595 --> 07:21.072
The blood trail begins
just over here, sir.

07:21.423 --> 07:24.163
I looked everywhere, but I wasn't
able to locate a murder weapon.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.077
Perhaps we'll have more luck
in the full light of day.

07:45.406 --> 07:48.248
- This way! Come on!
- Why are you after us?

07:48.290 --> 07:50.536
We're in the right here.
Unless you're one of them.

07:50.569 --> 07:52.463
- One of whom?
- The Jews.

07:52.504 --> 07:54.200
How would that matter
one way or the other?

07:54.218 --> 07:56.852
- Move along!
- Stay with him! Come on!

07:56.930 --> 07:58.703
Keep moving! I'll show you!

07:58.750 --> 08:00.237
Release these men!

08:00.661 --> 08:02.402
And you responsible for this rabble?

08:02.447 --> 08:04.530
They've got a right to speak
their minds, haven't they?

08:04.554 --> 08:06.447
By what law are you arresting these men?

08:06.572 --> 08:07.879
Well, let's see.

08:07.939 --> 08:11.416
Try disturbing the peace, damage
to property. Take your pick.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.893
You put a stop to the
protest, now let them go.

08:16.358 --> 08:17.813
They can go home

08:17.938 --> 08:19.315
when I say so.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.906
I'd advise you to back away.

08:27.802 --> 08:30.475
Alright then. How much
is this gonna cost me?

08:30.509 --> 08:33.211
Are you trying to bribe me?

08:33.801 --> 08:35.591
Do yourself a favour.

08:35.607 --> 08:39.005
Put your money away and
get out of my station house.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.316
If you happen to remember
anything, please contact me.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.902
- Thank you.
- What have you, John?

08:57.158 --> 09:00.307
No one I've spoken to so far
has seen anything noteworthy.

09:00.359 --> 09:02.127
Who is this young woman?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.971
She's Miss Charlotte Hanson, sir.

09:05.892 --> 09:08.512
- Uh, the singer.
- She seems quite distressed.

09:08.530 --> 09:10.557
What was her relationship
to the deceased?

09:11.081 --> 09:13.216
I don't know.

09:13.239 --> 09:15.453
I was reluctant to disturb her.

09:15.484 --> 09:17.789
I did ask you to speak with everyone.

09:26.163 --> 09:27.856
Miss Hanson.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.262
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

09:30.332 --> 09:31.971
Thank you.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.373
Did you know the deceased?

09:35.024 --> 09:36.682
Yes.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.777
He was a very good man.

09:39.106 --> 09:41.446
When did you last see Mr. Michaelson?

09:41.898 --> 09:43.749
Before the show.

09:43.782 --> 09:46.435
- He and Saul...
- Saul... ?

09:46.618 --> 09:50.212
Saul Levine, the director. He and Abe...

09:50.221 --> 09:52.390
- Mr. Michaelson?
- Yes.

09:52.584 --> 09:55.693
They were backstage speaking
with the Jolson brothers.

09:55.818 --> 09:58.065
Or rather arguing.

09:58.255 --> 10:00.032
What were they arguing about?

10:00.310 --> 10:03.863
The Jolsons wanted their
pay before going on stage.

10:04.168 --> 10:07.139
When I went into my dressing
room, they were still at it.

10:07.973 --> 10:09.833
Well, there's Saul now.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.774
Oh, he must be terribly upset.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.189
Abe was my brother-in-law.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.686
His wife, my sister, we're all
from the same town in Latvia.

10:20.811 --> 10:23.429
- Has she been informed?
- She's not even in the country.

10:23.470 --> 10:26.633
She was intending on coming
over but I guess now...

10:26.866 --> 10:30.240
- I understand Mr. Michaelson owns this building.
- Yes.

10:30.365 --> 10:32.618
He offered it to me for the fundraiser.

10:32.652 --> 10:35.200
We were intending to open
a full-time theatre here.

10:35.232 --> 10:37.774
I see. And when did you last see him?

10:38.152 --> 10:40.547
I went to the box office
just before the show started.

10:40.731 --> 10:42.136
He was counting up the money.

10:42.177 --> 10:45.069
We did very nicely... almost $200!

10:45.277 --> 10:47.293
And where is that money now?

10:50.514 --> 10:51.766
It's gone. I...

10:51.891 --> 10:54.064
Perhaps he had it on him?

10:54.479 --> 10:57.322
There was nothing found
on Mr. Michaelson's person.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.034
This is terrible.

10:59.089 --> 11:00.895
How will I pay the performers?

11:01.493 --> 11:04.207
You and Mr. Michaelson
were heard arguing

11:04.221 --> 11:06.359
with the Jolsons earlier today,

11:06.484 --> 11:09.109
- over money.
- We were only arguing with Al.

11:09.149 --> 11:10.541
Such a hothead!

11:10.577 --> 11:12.203
And Mr. Michaelson refused?

11:12.230 --> 11:13.980
We both did. It's not done that way.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.767
You don't pay until they play.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.835
But Al Jolson thought different.

11:19.635 --> 11:23.482
- Hmm...
- We're performers, Detective Murdoch, not killers.

11:24.060 --> 11:26.176
Where were you both when the show began?

11:26.301 --> 11:28.987
I was waiting in the wings to
go on after the lady singer.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.480
She and Levine saw me
there. Then I was onstage.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.926
And you were late to make your entrance.

11:33.995 --> 11:36.166
I'd gone to my dressing
room for a smoke.

11:36.206 --> 11:37.930
I guess I lost track of time.

11:38.676 --> 11:41.562
Is it possible that you
were in the alleyway?

11:41.994 --> 11:44.570
Nah, I was in my dressing
room, like I said.

11:45.309 --> 11:46.857
You smoke cigarettes?

11:47.205 --> 11:51.072
Sure do. New brand.
Smooth. Helps the voice.

11:51.089 --> 11:53.112
But hard to get your hands on.

11:55.264 --> 11:58.113
- These?
- Where did you find those?

11:58.349 --> 11:59.784
In the alleyway.

11:59.996 --> 12:02.019
Jeez... You're kidding?

12:02.466 --> 12:05.691
- I wonder how they got there.
- You dropped them there.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.530
Because you were in the alleyway
when the murder occurred.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.403
Not in your dressing
room as you claimed.

12:10.453 --> 12:15.335
- But you see, that... that's...
- You're lying to the wrong person, Mr. Jolson.

12:22.506 --> 12:25.723
What's the big deal? So I
forgot I was out in the alley.

12:26.604 --> 12:30.249
You were heard arguing with
Mr. Michaelson about money.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.692
You could have followed
him out into the alleyway,

12:32.701 --> 12:34.561
murdered him and taken
the cash he was holding.

12:34.581 --> 12:35.750
No!

12:36.142 --> 12:38.090
Alright, you're right
I was out there, but

12:38.127 --> 12:41.235
- I didn't kill that cheap bastard.
- Then why lie?

12:42.487 --> 12:43.822
Because...

12:44.137 --> 12:46.230
the truth is embarrassing.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.868
More embarrassing than jail time?

12:50.936 --> 12:55.282
I sometimes get sick
with nerves before a show.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.856
- Physically sick.
- So?

12:58.176 --> 13:00.255
A performer with stage fright?

13:00.969 --> 13:03.820
If it ever got out, I'd be the
laughing stock of Vaudeville.

13:03.986 --> 13:05.694
I find it very difficult

13:05.703 --> 13:08.343
- to believe that someone with your experience...
- I can prove it!

13:08.490 --> 13:11.590
There was a kid out there,
a Jewish boy, about yea high.

13:11.715 --> 13:13.580
He had my picture and
asked me to sign it.

13:13.613 --> 13:14.727
So I did.

13:14.916 --> 13:16.527
Find the kid, he'll tell you.

13:17.223 --> 13:19.737
His brother confirms that he's often

13:19.760 --> 13:21.787
indisposed due to stage fright.

13:21.828 --> 13:24.577
So Mr. Jolson could very
well have been in the alley

13:24.605 --> 13:26.405
for less than nefarious reasons.

13:26.627 --> 13:27.898
So someone else.

13:27.921 --> 13:31.743
Perhaps the boy saw more than
just Mr. Jolson in the alleyway.

13:31.775 --> 13:33.799
If he actually exists.

13:34.379 --> 13:37.188
Why not release Mr.
Jolson into my custody?

13:37.225 --> 13:40.311
I'll take him to the Ward to
see whether we can find this boy.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.151
Mr. Jolson.

13:46.202 --> 13:48.205
I'm sorry about your
performance last night.

13:48.252 --> 13:51.085
I certainly hope you and your
brother will be back in Toronto soon.

13:51.849 --> 13:54.198
The Jolson Brothers no longer exist.

13:54.502 --> 13:55.948
What are you talking about?

13:56.418 --> 13:57.896
Harry took off on me,

13:58.122 --> 13:59.462
quit the act.

13:59.670 --> 14:01.167
Never got along anyway.

14:01.199 --> 14:02.761
Maybe you'll be better off on your own.

14:02.789 --> 14:04.520
I don't know, Vaudeville
is a tough business,

14:04.525 --> 14:06.557
and now there's the
nickelodeons to compete with.

14:06.682 --> 14:07.961
You could try that.

14:08.219 --> 14:09.633
Moving pictures?

14:09.648 --> 14:11.490
They don't even have
any talking in them.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.538
Anyway, I'm gonna need a new schtick.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.085
A schtick? What's that?

14:15.269 --> 14:18.420
A schtick is a show-business
gimmick you get known by.

14:18.752 --> 14:21.100
Like ventriloquism or sword swallowing?

14:21.141 --> 14:24.177
Those are acts. A schtick
is just a bit of flim-flam,

14:24.195 --> 14:26.138
something you get known for, like,

14:26.157 --> 14:29.017
say, smoking a cigar or
dressing like a tramp.

14:29.053 --> 14:30.941
Alright. Shall we?

14:31.066 --> 14:32.671
Are you heading to the theatre?

14:32.977 --> 14:34.281
Perhaps I should join you?

14:34.483 --> 14:36.164
Sorry, kid. We're going to the Ward.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.228
Why the sudden interest in theatre?

14:38.854 --> 14:41.687
I... I... I've always
been interested in theatre.

14:42.239 --> 14:44.947
- And the people there.
- Hmm.

14:45.781 --> 14:47.152
With me.

14:52.644 --> 14:54.011
In the Jewish religion,

14:54.016 --> 14:56.903
a holy man prays over
the body until burial.

14:57.028 --> 14:58.912
It's a little distracting.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.365
Have you been able to
conduct your post-mortem?

15:01.399 --> 15:02.619
Yes.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.278
As I suspected,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.714
the abdominal aorta was lacerated.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.380
He wouldn't have lasted
longer than five minutes.

15:10.776 --> 15:14.430
There's also an unusual
narrow bruise above the wound.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.197
Suggesting the murder weapon
had a perpendicular handle?

15:19.517 --> 15:22.260
Indeed. There's also something else.

15:23.788 --> 15:26.230
I found this debris in the wound.

15:31.309 --> 15:32.824
Mortar particles.

15:33.888 --> 15:36.720
There is some masonry
work underway in the alley

15:36.739 --> 15:38.403
where the murder occurred.

15:38.641 --> 15:40.447
Perhaps the weapon was a masonry tool?

15:40.474 --> 15:42.583
- It's my thoughts exactly.
- Dr. Ogden?

15:42.625 --> 15:45.150
Oh, Miss Clark! To what
do we owe the pleasure?

15:45.181 --> 15:46.539
I have something to show you.

15:46.581 --> 15:49.460
One of the previously infertile rabbits

15:49.501 --> 15:51.550
has now successfully

15:51.596 --> 15:53.884
given birth to...

15:54.835 --> 15:56.480
to this healthy specimen.

15:56.484 --> 16:00.833
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Yes. Although unfortunately, it is male.

16:00.856 --> 16:03.607
- May I?
- Yes, of course.

16:06.894 --> 16:08.466
Oh...

16:08.591 --> 16:09.974
William...

16:10.458 --> 16:11.802
look.

16:12.156 --> 16:15.839
- That is extraordinary, Miss Clark.
- Yes.

16:16.112 --> 16:18.415
We are most grateful to you.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.649
You needn't be. The priority here

16:20.666 --> 16:24.569
is the work which is being
done by your wife and myself.

16:25.088 --> 16:26.809
Of course. Of course.

16:26.832 --> 16:28.737
But as a prospective father,

16:28.916 --> 16:31.547
- I can't help but tell you that I am...
- If a baby is born,

16:31.570 --> 16:33.861
you will have been merely its donor.

16:33.913 --> 16:35.191
Good day.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.364
Don't worry, William,

16:40.398 --> 16:42.609
I think you're much more than that.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.879
Religions tend to produce
many beautiful objects.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.888
Yeah, if you go in
for that sort of thing.

16:56.923 --> 16:58.712
I read that those leather boxes

16:58.747 --> 17:01.840
contain tiny scrolls
inscribed with Torah verses.

17:01.892 --> 17:04.361
I haven't worn one of
them since my bar mitzvah.

17:04.486 --> 17:06.190
Why the hairpieces?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.253
They're called scheitels.
Some Orthodox Jewish women

17:09.294 --> 17:11.298
- shave their heads.
- Why?

17:11.423 --> 17:14.066
To show fidelity to their husbands.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.117
I'm not sure I follow.
Is that to make them

17:17.141 --> 17:18.763
less attractive to other men?

17:18.769 --> 17:21.271
I guess so. But those
wigs ain't much better.

17:21.545 --> 17:22.696
Looking for that kid here

17:22.702 --> 17:24.428
is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

17:24.452 --> 17:26.902
I once found a needle in a haystack.

17:27.242 --> 17:30.337
I can't believe my eyes! It's Al Jolson!

17:31.115 --> 17:32.496
What's that you have there?

17:32.763 --> 17:35.047
That's it. That's the
picture I signed for the kid!

17:35.098 --> 17:37.354
- How did you come by this?
- I bought it

17:37.373 --> 17:40.389
outside the show from
a boy named Yitzhak.

17:40.445 --> 17:44.235
Only this big, but already
a little gesheftsman. Haha!

17:44.244 --> 17:45.920
An antreprneye'r, yeah.

17:45.948 --> 17:47.388
Do you know where we might find him?

17:47.951 --> 17:50.926
Always everywhere, that little yungatsh.

17:50.963 --> 17:53.313
Who knows? Maybe he even pays

17:53.331 --> 17:55.334
the schoolhouse a visit now and then.

17:55.371 --> 17:58.908
You're Al Jolson!

17:58.942 --> 18:01.128
- Alright.
- Ha!

18:01.645 --> 18:03.375
Al Jolson.

18:07.322 --> 18:09.220
Can I help you with
something, Constable?

18:11.035 --> 18:13.315
- My name's John.
- All right.

18:13.356 --> 18:14.679
My name's Charlotte.

18:16.581 --> 18:19.364
I'm assisting Mr.
Jolson with his new act.

18:19.396 --> 18:21.025
- Are you really?
- I am.

18:21.057 --> 18:22.881
Then you ought to know he's not here.

18:24.368 --> 18:25.569
Yes, um...

18:25.603 --> 18:28.580
I just had a few more
questions regarding the case.

18:29.088 --> 18:30.241
Yes?

18:32.252 --> 18:34.333
I think you're quite talented.

18:35.204 --> 18:36.784
That was your question?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.100
Oh-oh, oh no. Hmm...

18:41.929 --> 18:44.256
I... wanted to ask

18:44.288 --> 18:46.682
if you would step out for tea with me.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.039
I'm flattered, Constable,

18:50.712 --> 18:53.685
and I admit I am partial
to men in uniform,

18:54.454 --> 18:56.029
but you must realize,

18:56.075 --> 18:59.469
that having just lost Abe,
I remain deep in mourning.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.815
Who's Abe?

19:02.043 --> 19:05.037
Mr. Michaelson. We were... involved.

19:05.663 --> 19:07.325
But he was old.

19:07.768 --> 19:09.910
Well, young men can be sweet, but

19:10.080 --> 19:12.317
older men have a special appeal.

19:15.926 --> 19:17.989
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.299
If Mr. Jolson is telling the truth,

19:28.581 --> 19:30.815
he entered the theatre through that door

19:30.835 --> 19:33.436
followed shortly after by Mr. Michaelson

19:33.505 --> 19:35.407
who left this trail of blood.

19:35.955 --> 19:37.976
Now, the murder likely occurred...

19:38.502 --> 19:39.844
here.

19:39.969 --> 19:42.366
Michaelson must have entered
the alley from the street,

19:42.367 --> 19:43.981
or Jolson would have seen him.

19:44.015 --> 19:46.760
Or he exited the building
through the box office

19:46.765 --> 19:49.453
and entered the alley that way. But why?

19:49.625 --> 19:51.334
And where's the bloody murder weapon?

19:55.645 --> 19:57.219
Toronto Constabulary.

19:57.878 --> 19:59.998
You must be here because of that murder.

20:00.494 --> 20:02.018
I saw the blood.

20:02.999 --> 20:05.458
Yes. May we have a look at your tools?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.646
This one is brand new.

20:15.987 --> 20:17.111
It is.

20:17.525 --> 20:18.935
I left mine yesterday.

20:19.119 --> 20:21.019
When I came back this
morning, it was gone.

20:21.051 --> 20:23.113
I just got back from buying a new one.

20:24.055 --> 20:27.933
Where were you last evening
between the hours of 6:45 and 7:15?

20:27.945 --> 20:29.541
I was at the pub across the street.

20:29.569 --> 20:31.463
- Ask anyone.
- We will.

20:31.588 --> 20:34.763
- I think we'll have to hold on to this.
- But I just bought it!

20:35.004 --> 20:36.801
Life's tough.

20:37.054 --> 20:38.746
We'll compare this against the wound,

20:38.769 --> 20:40.882
but the murder weapon
is likely one of these.

20:40.934 --> 20:42.954
Our killer must have seen
the original lying there,

20:42.965 --> 20:44.542
picked it up and then done the deed.

20:44.575 --> 20:47.379
Suggesting the murder
was not premeditated.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.646
Hey!

20:48.889 --> 20:51.036
What are you doing on my property?!

20:51.905 --> 20:54.858
I think you'll find that this
alleyway belongs to the City.

20:54.870 --> 20:56.793
Well, this building belongs to me.

20:57.154 --> 20:59.365
A murder occurred here last night.

21:00.109 --> 21:01.381
Tragic.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.581
And the tool that was
in use on your building

21:03.599 --> 21:05.372
is more than likely the murder weapon.

21:05.497 --> 21:10.007
Where were you last night between
the hours of 6:45 and 7:15?

21:11.460 --> 21:13.805
I was on my way to your station house.

21:14.381 --> 21:16.941
That's no more than
10-minutes walk from here.

21:16.973 --> 21:19.513
You didn't arrive 'til after 7:45.

21:20.060 --> 21:22.853
I first went to my
office to procure the cash

21:22.917 --> 21:24.883
which you so rudely rejected.

21:24.915 --> 21:27.178
Now if you'll excuse me,
you can talk to my lawyer

21:27.207 --> 21:29.171
if you have any further questions.

21:29.718 --> 21:31.805
Good day, gentlemen.

21:34.022 --> 21:35.879
Let's get a move on here, please!

21:35.893 --> 21:37.822
Two days at this?! Two days, really?!

21:44.270 --> 21:46.969
The boy is certainly proving elusive.

21:56.878 --> 21:59.984
I believe my mother used
to sing that song to me.

22:00.017 --> 22:01.736
Oh yeah?

22:08.659 --> 22:10.752
- That's an old Yiddish lullaby.
- What?

22:10.774 --> 22:13.365
If your mother sang that,
your family must be Jewish.

22:13.490 --> 22:16.481
That's highly unlikely.
Watts is not a Jewish name.

22:16.523 --> 22:17.798
Names are changed all the time

22:17.817 --> 22:19.797
when folks get off the
boat from the old country.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.538
And if your mother was Jewish,

22:21.571 --> 22:22.804
so are you.

22:22.850 --> 22:24.701
- Welcome in, my friend.
- Oh!

22:24.761 --> 22:27.059
Now I know where you get your
tremendous sense of humour.

22:27.082 --> 22:29.090
Are you being facetious?

22:29.215 --> 22:32.056
Probably, whatever that means.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.057
Sirs, I just spoke to Miss Hanson.

22:40.258 --> 22:41.234
The singer.

22:41.266 --> 22:43.781
Yes. She told me she was in a
relationship with the victim.

22:43.813 --> 22:44.905
Thought he was married.

22:44.924 --> 22:47.222
He was. But his wife is still in Latvia.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.908
Why did she not tell us this before?

22:49.982 --> 22:51.216
I don't know, I didn't ask.

22:51.594 --> 22:52.626
Right.

22:52.957 --> 22:54.426
I'm off to the theatre.

22:54.459 --> 22:55.836
- Thank you.
- Sir.

22:55.873 --> 22:57.996
Oi!

22:58.369 --> 23:00.144
What were you doing back at the theatre?

23:00.269 --> 23:02.680
- Asking more questions.
- On your own?

23:02.712 --> 23:03.795
Yes.

23:03.988 --> 23:05.876
Did Murdoch ask you to do that?

23:06.355 --> 23:08.612
Well, not exactly...

23:09.161 --> 23:10.731
Not exactly?

23:13.854 --> 23:16.760
I... I went back to
ask Miss Hanson to tea.

23:17.074 --> 23:19.939
Lady of the theatre? Excellent choice!

23:20.160 --> 23:21.465
Older woman, is she?

23:21.499 --> 23:23.500
- She's not old!
- She's older than you, though.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.603
And experience is a great attribute.

23:25.635 --> 23:27.257
Especially in a woman.

23:27.538 --> 23:29.141
Mum's the word, eh?

23:36.661 --> 23:39.669
Why did you not mention your
relationship to Mr. Michaelson?

23:39.734 --> 23:41.351
Well, no one asked me.

23:41.531 --> 23:44.060
And he always insisted
we keep it secret.

23:44.492 --> 23:46.597
He was very protective of my honour.

23:48.071 --> 23:49.860
Did you know he was married?

23:51.952 --> 23:54.463
His wife stayed behind in Latvia.

23:54.886 --> 23:56.060
And he was going to divorce her,

23:56.083 --> 23:57.838
and we were going to move to New York.

23:58.201 --> 24:00.233
He thought I could be a star down there.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.212
When were you planning on leaving?

24:02.295 --> 24:04.626
As soon as I got offstage that night.

24:05.266 --> 24:07.454
He said we could use the gate
money to make our getaway,

24:07.478 --> 24:09.425
and he'd sell the building later.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.749
Why the sudden rush?

24:12.267 --> 24:13.584
He wouldn't say.

24:13.634 --> 24:16.646
Just that he had no choice,
and it was now or never.

24:17.268 --> 24:19.705
Sounds like the director had
reason to kill Michaelson.

24:19.718 --> 24:22.059
- Mr. Levine?
- He stood to lose the most.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.979
He found out that Michaelson
was about to make off

24:23.993 --> 24:25.405
with the money and put a stop to it.

24:25.429 --> 24:27.415
Not to mention the victim
had been dishonouring

24:27.431 --> 24:29.096
- Mr. Levine's sister.
- Mm-hmm.

24:29.165 --> 24:32.302
Sirs, was the missing money
from the theatre recovered?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.070
No. Why?

24:34.089 --> 24:36.493
I've just heard Mr. Levine
is re-staging the show,

24:36.507 --> 24:38.617
and he's paying every
performer what he owes them.

24:44.304 --> 24:45.571
Mr. Levine.

24:46.312 --> 24:48.952
We understand you'll
be remounting your show.

24:49.173 --> 24:51.107
Oh, uh, that's right.

24:51.232 --> 24:53.424
But I thought the money
that was to be used

24:53.438 --> 24:55.345
for that purpose had gone missing.

24:56.446 --> 24:58.182
- That's true, but...
- Sir.

24:58.385 --> 25:00.775
We paid admittance with this very bill.

25:01.031 --> 25:02.782
This is the money from the box office.

25:11.565 --> 25:14.554
That money came from your
brother-in-law's dead body.

25:14.564 --> 25:15.678
That's not true.

25:15.757 --> 25:17.497
I noticed a suitcase in his office.

25:17.502 --> 25:20.692
I looked inside and found the cash
that was intended for the show.

25:20.817 --> 25:22.310
In a suitcase.

25:22.435 --> 25:23.909
Did you not find that odd?

25:23.946 --> 25:25.990
I was just happy to find the money.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.101
Perhaps you were unsurprised

25:29.113 --> 25:31.229
because you knew of
Mr. Michaelson's plans.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.932
His plans to abandon you,

25:33.964 --> 25:36.500
your dream of a Yiddish
theatre, and worst of all,

25:36.625 --> 25:38.526
- your sister.
- I wanted that Abe

25:38.558 --> 25:42.036
should honour his marriage to my
sister but I didn't want him dead!

25:42.440 --> 25:45.956
I beg of you... my wife
needs me at the house.

25:46.895 --> 25:48.277
Why do you say that?

25:48.448 --> 25:50.056
We're holding the Shiva there.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.519
He was my brother-in-law,
and he was my friend.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.670
I didn't kill him.

25:56.660 --> 25:58.489
Speak to Charlotte Hanson.

25:58.521 --> 26:00.141
She saw me go straight into the audience

26:00.150 --> 26:02.427
to watch the show after
I introduced the Jolsons.

26:02.552 --> 26:05.120
I never would have had
time to do anything to Abe.

26:06.926 --> 26:08.054
It's true.

26:08.091 --> 26:09.842
Just after he introduced the Jolsons,

26:09.865 --> 26:12.804
I saw Mr. Levine take the
seat he'd reserved for himself.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.506
All right. Thank you, Miss Hanson.

26:15.538 --> 26:16.736
Not at all.

26:17.344 --> 26:19.103
And you, Constable?

26:19.651 --> 26:21.779
Did you have any questions for me?

26:22.120 --> 26:23.488
Only, um...

26:24.672 --> 26:26.381
Well, how about compliments?

26:26.791 --> 26:28.761
John! Let's go.

26:28.886 --> 26:30.000
Sorry.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.824
What was that about?

26:32.930 --> 26:35.228
What? Nothing. Nothing with anything.

26:35.593 --> 26:37.894
Are you all right?
You seem a little odd.

26:37.928 --> 26:40.487
Yes. I mean, no.

26:40.556 --> 26:43.988
I mean I'm not odd, I'm
just the way I usually am.

26:44.113 --> 26:46.577
Mr. Barney? What brings you here?

26:46.996 --> 26:49.907
I intend to contact Michaelson's widow.

26:50.077 --> 26:51.909
They have addresses in Latvia?

26:51.942 --> 26:53.614
Someone here must know, hmm?

26:53.674 --> 26:55.579
What do you need her address for?

26:55.881 --> 26:57.490
Michaelson's dead.

26:57.525 --> 26:59.225
I'm assuming the
building goes to his wife.

26:59.261 --> 27:00.892
I plan on making her an offer.

27:01.218 --> 27:03.135
Now, if you'll excuse me,

27:03.153 --> 27:04.889
I'll find that weasel Levine.

27:05.327 --> 27:06.589
Levine!

27:06.598 --> 27:10.407
It appears that my parents
were in fact the Wattenbergs.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.072
They wouldn't be the first
to change their names.

27:12.096 --> 27:14.104
My name used to be Asa Yoelson.

27:14.229 --> 27:16.301
Perhaps they were simply non-believers?

27:16.315 --> 27:19.682
You don't need belief to
be a Jew. Just attitude.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.478
But surely the religion
is defined by its dogma.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.095
Nah. All you need to be a Jew

27:24.104 --> 27:26.618
is to know how to cry and
laugh at the same time.

27:26.651 --> 27:28.612
Oof! I have a lot to learn then.

27:28.645 --> 27:30.914
What about all the
rules and the rituals?

27:30.948 --> 27:33.518
There's a lot of 'em. More
than I can keep track of.

27:33.596 --> 27:35.519
And if you neglect to follow them...

27:35.553 --> 27:36.705
You're still a Jew.

27:36.830 --> 27:38.073
You're just a bad Jew.

27:38.483 --> 27:40.789
Say, I have an idea. I'm on
my way to Michaelson's Shiva...

27:40.807 --> 27:42.119
What's a Shiva?

27:42.188 --> 27:45.666
A gathering at the mourners' home
to support the one's grieving.

27:45.723 --> 27:48.371
- Also to perform the Kaddish.
- What's the Kaddish?

27:48.454 --> 27:50.701
A prayer recited for the dead.

27:50.729 --> 27:53.276
Anyway, Levine is desperate for
there to be enough Jewish males

27:53.304 --> 27:54.979
- to form a Minyan. The...
- Oh, what's a...

27:55.003 --> 27:57.739
The ten men needed to say
the prayer twice a day.

27:57.775 --> 28:01.110
Why ten? Why not, say, nine? Or five?

28:01.129 --> 28:04.030
Oy, the questions with
this one. How should I know?

28:04.090 --> 28:05.827
Come with me, Detective Wattenberg.

28:05.831 --> 28:07.227
They can always use another Jew.

28:14.725 --> 28:15.845
Sir?

28:17.622 --> 28:19.847
Saul Levine walked past

28:19.972 --> 28:23.734
Charlotte Hanson backstage
at approximately 7:10 p.m.

28:23.859 --> 28:25.419
and made his way

28:25.446 --> 28:27.855
to his seat in the audience.

28:28.399 --> 28:30.992
Therefore, he could not have
made it out into the alley

28:31.008 --> 28:33.111
- in time to commit the murder.
- Mhm.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.169
Sir, while I was at the theatre,

28:35.211 --> 28:36.868
who should show up, but Horace Barney.

28:37.301 --> 28:38.423
For what purpose?

28:38.476 --> 28:40.705
He intends to buy the building
from Michaelson's widow.

28:41.547 --> 28:43.966
Presumably to put an end
to the Yiddish Theatre.

28:43.994 --> 28:45.454
Well, sir, I thought so too,

28:45.537 --> 28:47.389
but I went to the City
Licensing Department

28:47.514 --> 28:50.327
and I had a look at Mr.
Barney's business dealings and...

28:53.994 --> 28:55.733
♪
- He's building an office tower.

28:55.766 --> 28:58.434
A skyscraper, sir. Fourteen stories.

28:58.559 --> 29:01.471
This one would cover nearly that
entire block of Queen Street.

29:01.596 --> 29:04.017
Yes, but Mr. Barney's plans

29:04.026 --> 29:06.098
are barely drawings on
paper until he's able

29:06.126 --> 29:08.083
to procure all the properties necessary.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.958
Including the theatre building, sir.

29:12.611 --> 29:13.947
Indeed.

29:15.688 --> 29:17.447
Excellent initiative, Henry.

29:18.101 --> 29:19.754
Thank you, sir.

29:21.412 --> 29:23.835
My father never shed a
tear when my mother died,

29:23.886 --> 29:25.373
but he still tore his shirt.

29:25.596 --> 29:27.008
Why would he do that?

29:27.036 --> 29:30.195
Oh, it's obligatory for the immediate
family members, the mourners.

29:30.467 --> 29:33.074
He didn't change that shirt
the entire week of the Shiva.

29:34.465 --> 29:37.774
This is a reminder
of the divine presence

29:37.775 --> 29:39.944
above us who watches our every act.

29:40.296 --> 29:42.429
Most people take that to mean God.

29:42.813 --> 29:45.362
Unfortunately for me, it was my father.

30:01.003 --> 30:02.242
Detective.

30:02.790 --> 30:04.108
I'm surprised to see you here.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.323
Detective Watts recently
discovered his Jewishness.

30:07.862 --> 30:11.383
- You converted?
- Uhhh, no, I recognized a song.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.397
Is that a joke, Detective?

30:13.838 --> 30:16.146
Mazel tov you'll make
a very fine Jew one day.

30:16.528 --> 30:19.402
Allow me to introduce my wife, Rivka.

30:19.733 --> 30:22.709
We're hosting the Shiva because
Abe has no immediate family here.

30:22.976 --> 30:25.269
- Oh, it's very generous of you.
- Honestly,

30:25.619 --> 30:28.320
- I'd much rather be at the theatre.
- Mhm.

30:29.559 --> 30:32.234
Ah, I better gather the men for mynian.

30:36.395 --> 30:39.283
Do Orthodox Jewish women not speak?

30:39.294 --> 30:41.073
Normally, you can't shut them up.

30:41.198 --> 30:42.967
But I think maybe she
just got off the boat.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.976
And speaks no English?

30:45.009 --> 30:47.196
Probably a little, but not
comfortable with it yet.

30:48.045 --> 30:49.986
If she's the hostess,
she's doing a lousy job.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.189
This Shiva house is a mess.

30:51.221 --> 30:53.123
There aren't even enough
plates for the food.

30:54.541 --> 30:55.894
Come on, Wattenberg, this is our cue.

30:55.918 --> 30:58.585
How can I join in a prayer
when I don't know it?

30:58.756 --> 31:00.744
Just move your lips
and hum, you'll do fine.

31:23.614 --> 31:26.227
Is there something
particularly interesting

31:26.282 --> 31:28.887
- about that bicycle, Constable?
- No, no. Uh...

31:31.029 --> 31:34.125
Detective Watts, may I ask your advice?

31:34.157 --> 31:35.681
Certainly.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.297
It's about a woman.

31:39.595 --> 31:41.518
Let me guess, you invited a lady

31:41.531 --> 31:43.934
to accompany you on an
outing, and she declined.

31:44.213 --> 31:46.336
Yes, how did... how did you know?

31:46.369 --> 31:49.629
I would counsel you to
persevere. Ask again.

31:49.664 --> 31:53.551
As Lord Nelson wrote, "The
boldest measures are the safest."

31:53.676 --> 31:58.335
Although, I suppose a woman
is quite unlike a Danish fleet.

31:59.016 --> 32:01.202
But I should persevere?

32:01.218 --> 32:03.344
Yes. Tread softly, Young Brackenreid.

32:03.362 --> 32:07.191
Let her know that if her inclination
changes, your offer still stands.

32:07.685 --> 32:09.383
I'm going back to the theater.

32:09.508 --> 32:12.735
- This lady is in the theatrical profession?
- She is.

32:13.005 --> 32:15.620
You continue to surprise me, Constable.

32:15.838 --> 32:17.335
All right.

32:24.255 --> 32:27.845
In the past several months, Mr.
Barney's company has bought this one,

32:27.877 --> 32:30.501
this one and I believe this one.

32:31.111 --> 32:34.007
He would need several more
properties to make his project viable.

32:34.047 --> 32:36.461
I've spoken to several of
the neighbours and they say

32:36.478 --> 32:38.111
that he has been
pressuring them to sell.

32:38.129 --> 32:41.109
Although he's not offering enough
to make it worth their while.

32:41.132 --> 32:43.273
Presumably that included Mr. Michaelson.

32:43.504 --> 32:47.415
And he has been stoking anti-Semitic
protests to pressure him.

32:47.622 --> 32:49.767
But Michaelson still wouldn't sell.

32:49.799 --> 32:51.411
And he ended up dead.

32:51.607 --> 32:53.679
Even a low-ball offer
would seem like a fortune

32:53.683 --> 32:55.873
- to his widow back in Latvia.
- Exactly.

32:56.211 --> 32:57.407
Hmm...

32:57.441 --> 32:58.925
It's really him.

32:59.634 --> 33:01.686
No!

33:01.726 --> 33:04.595
- That's him! That's the kid!
- Hey! Hey!

33:04.991 --> 33:08.219
- Gotcha, you little runt!
- What's that in your hand?

33:08.408 --> 33:10.029
Ah, looky here...

33:10.084 --> 33:12.286
A pile of Al Jolson photos.

33:12.313 --> 33:14.959
- Did you steal these from me?
- And they're all autographed.

33:14.991 --> 33:17.067
Not by me.

33:17.131 --> 33:19.696
Yitzhak, it seems, is a young thief.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.553
And an excellent forger.

33:21.604 --> 33:23.901
So that's why you ran,
you little yungatsh.

33:23.933 --> 33:25.850
I just wanted some money

33:25.868 --> 33:27.771
to buy my mom a chicken for the Sabbath.

33:28.060 --> 33:31.257
One chicken? What are you
doing, kid? Giving 'em away?

33:33.919 --> 33:36.580
And after Mr. Jolson
signed the photograph?

33:37.056 --> 33:38.821
He said he better get onstage

33:38.844 --> 33:40.732
before his brother
drove the audience away.

33:41.022 --> 33:42.639
So he went back inside?

33:43.319 --> 33:44.633
What happened after that?

33:44.960 --> 33:48.884
I went to the street to watch the
protests, but everyone was gone.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.104
Then I heard yelling
coming from the alley

33:51.127 --> 33:52.776
and saw someone running.

33:53.301 --> 33:55.166
Can you describe this person?

33:55.291 --> 33:57.731
It was dark and his back was to me, but

33:57.856 --> 34:00.244
the street lamp lit
up the top of his head

34:00.369 --> 34:01.508
because he was bald.

34:02.038 --> 34:03.281
Excuse me, sirs.

34:03.339 --> 34:04.829
I've brought in Mr. Barney.

34:05.409 --> 34:07.611
How dare you drag me down here!

34:07.644 --> 34:09.918
We just have a few
questions, Mr. Barney.

34:09.937 --> 34:12.871
Well, then get it over with...
my dinner's already cold.

34:17.647 --> 34:19.089
Right this way.

34:19.815 --> 34:21.692
This better be brief.

34:33.598 --> 34:36.518
You killed Mr. Michaelson so
that you could pressure his widow

34:36.541 --> 34:38.263
into selling you the property.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.619
You've got it backwards, Detective.

34:40.626 --> 34:42.713
Michaelson and I, we weren't enemies.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.715
You certainly weren't friends.

34:45.061 --> 34:46.684
We were in business together.

34:46.809 --> 34:49.353
You organized an anti-Semitic protest

34:49.377 --> 34:50.822
outside of his theatre.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.130
That was his idea.

34:52.205 --> 34:54.692
He wanted you to
protest his own theatre?

34:55.331 --> 34:57.764
When I approached him
about buying his building,

34:57.796 --> 35:00.029
he suggested instead we become partners.

35:00.256 --> 35:02.973
Together we'd buy every
property on the block.

35:03.913 --> 35:05.801
And put up a skyscraper.

35:05.926 --> 35:07.238
Exactly.

35:09.914 --> 35:10.995
So,

35:11.898 --> 35:13.653
why the protests then?

35:13.832 --> 35:16.149
That was the genius of Abe's plan.

35:16.324 --> 35:18.392
He knew the Jews moving
into the neighbourhood

35:18.414 --> 35:19.838
would drive down property values,

35:19.861 --> 35:21.620
but we wanted to be sure.

35:22.542 --> 35:24.449
So you incited violence.

35:24.697 --> 35:26.153
Nothing serious.

35:26.180 --> 35:29.165
Just enough to put the other
landowners into a panic.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.444
Maybe you got greedy,

35:31.695 --> 35:34.231
you wanted to own the
entire enterprise yourself.

35:34.713 --> 35:37.099
Why would I kill my own business partner

35:37.168 --> 35:38.936
when everything was going our way?

35:39.591 --> 35:42.273
Perhaps you simply didn't
want a Jewish partner.

35:43.059 --> 35:45.074
This is the modern age, Detective...

35:45.108 --> 35:48.098
business trumps
religion, pure and simple.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.348
I didn't need you to bring me home.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.494
A boy your age should be in bed by now,

35:56.517 --> 35:59.073
not out roaming the streets. This is it?

35:59.285 --> 36:01.122
Toronto Constabulary.

36:03.314 --> 36:06.510
- I found your little businessman.
- What did you do now, Yitzhak?

36:06.566 --> 36:09.399
Get inside! Come.

36:10.637 --> 36:12.603
I'm sorry

36:12.635 --> 36:15.344
- for whatever wrong he did.
- It was nothing serious.

36:18.780 --> 36:19.976
You are Jewish?

36:20.010 --> 36:22.708
Uh... apparently I am.

36:23.316 --> 36:26.449
You will join us for the
Shabbos meal tomorrow?

36:27.452 --> 36:31.096
Very kind, but I'm sure
I would be intruding.

36:31.387 --> 36:33.019
Thank you, though.

36:33.687 --> 36:35.788
Michaelson stood to make a fortune

36:35.826 --> 36:37.573
if this deal with Barney succeeded.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.651
Why would he decide to
run off with the money

36:39.663 --> 36:42.824
- if he stood to make a lot more?
- Something compelled him.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.424
A heat-of 
the-moment decision.

36:44.465 --> 36:46.278
And some bald geezer got in the way.

36:46.403 --> 36:49.462
Yes. And Mr. Barney had
no motive, as it turns out.

36:49.848 --> 36:52.408
Jewish women sometime shave their heads.

36:52.442 --> 36:55.179
- What for?
- It's a tradition of some kind.

36:56.555 --> 36:59.514
- So the boy could have seen a woman?
- It's possible.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.806
Mr. Levine had an alibi,

37:01.835 --> 37:03.499
but we've yet to question his wife.

37:03.505 --> 37:05.053
Perhaps she shared his motive.

37:05.065 --> 37:07.575
They're hosting the Shiva
for Michaelson at their home.

37:07.955 --> 37:09.723
How do you know so much about all this?

37:09.746 --> 37:11.543
Ah, yes, I'd forgotten to mention

37:11.554 --> 37:14.064
I inadvertently
discovered that I'm Jewish.

37:21.957 --> 37:23.310
Detective?

37:43.393 --> 37:47.144
Does it seem at all unusual that
Mrs. Levine would be so bereft?

37:47.530 --> 37:50.266
Yeah, given that she's
not a close family member.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.706
She's an in-law of an in-law, isn't she?

37:55.505 --> 37:58.449
Mrs. Levine, a word?

37:59.317 --> 38:01.224
We'd like to ask you some questions

38:01.231 --> 38:03.635
about your brother-in-law,
Abraham Michaelson.

38:03.646 --> 38:06.369
This is a Shiva House.
Have you no respect?

38:06.421 --> 38:09.737
As a sister-in-law, would Mrs.
Levine be considered a mourner,

38:09.766 --> 38:11.856
- one who wears a tear in her clothing?
- Nope.

38:11.879 --> 38:14.764
You said she was doing
a lousy job as a hostess.

38:16.353 --> 38:19.058
Mrs. Levine, could you
please remove your shawl?

38:19.061 --> 38:21.338
Leave her be. My wife has
nothing to do with any of this!

38:21.364 --> 38:24.470
- I don't believe she is your wife at all.
- What are you... ?

38:27.664 --> 38:30.192
Oh, you're not an in-law. You're...

38:30.239 --> 38:32.042
- Remove your shawl.
- This is not the place.

38:32.056 --> 38:33.801
I demand that you leave
my house immediately!

38:33.815 --> 38:37.195
- We're not leaving, Mr. Levine.
- This woman is a mourner.

38:37.209 --> 38:39.586
Beneath her shawl, I believe
we will find that she's wearing

38:39.623 --> 38:42.104
a torn garment indicating
that she's the victim's wife.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.579
- Get out!
- No.

38:57.221 --> 38:58.701
Mrs. Michaelson,

38:58.939 --> 39:02.810
I'm placing you under arrest for
the murder of Abraham Michaelson.

39:05.994 --> 39:08.644
When I discovered Abe's
affair with Charlotte,

39:08.826 --> 39:11.221
I sent Rivka the money
to come to Canada.

39:12.378 --> 39:15.515
On the day of the show, she came
to the theatre and confronted Abe.

39:16.282 --> 39:17.792
He sent her away.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.201
But you didn't leave.

39:24.460 --> 39:27.239
- No! Stop it!
- No, I'm not!

39:27.258 --> 39:28.879
- You talk to me!
- No!

39:29.285 --> 39:32.503
- No? No get! No divorce!
- You will, you have to!

39:32.536 --> 39:35.072
I don't want you!

39:35.972 --> 39:37.607
Please, Abraham.

39:40.297 --> 39:41.744
- Enough!
- No!

39:52.021 --> 39:54.299
Ugh!

40:08.151 --> 40:10.481
Mrs. Michaelson, please explain to me;

40:11.241 --> 40:13.185
why would you choose to hold a Shiva

40:13.210 --> 40:14.747
for the husband who betrayed you?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.206
Why would you mourn him?

40:20.398 --> 40:22.885
I did a terrible thing,

40:23.887 --> 40:25.492
but...

40:25.704 --> 40:27.726
I still praise God.

40:38.597 --> 40:41.057
♪ I know I'm to blame ♪

40:41.070 --> 40:43.442
♪ Well, ain't that a shame ♪

40:43.472 --> 40:46.349
♪ Bill Bailey, won't
you please come home ♪

40:48.077 --> 40:50.547
♪ I know I'm to blame ♪

40:50.579 --> 40:52.748
♪ Well, ain't that a shame ♪

40:52.782 --> 40:57.721
♪ Bill Bailey, won't
you please come home ♪

41:06.989 --> 41:08.784
Constable!

41:08.949 --> 41:10.460
How nice to see you!

41:10.939 --> 41:13.758
- Have I done something wrong?
- No.

41:14.545 --> 41:17.173
I just wanted to apologize
if I was too forward.

41:17.608 --> 41:19.528
You were anything but.

41:22.003 --> 41:23.830
Was there something else?

41:24.813 --> 41:27.077
I... I just wanted to ask...

41:27.464 --> 41:29.982
when you've had enough time to
get over your recent heartbreak...

41:30.006 --> 41:31.991
And when do you think that will be?

41:32.893 --> 41:34.174
I... I don't know.

41:34.261 --> 41:36.542
You can take as much time as you need.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.347
I was thinking maybe next week?

41:38.568 --> 41:40.097
Or the week after.

41:41.589 --> 41:43.132
I... I don't know.

41:43.933 --> 41:46.328
Sorry, it was a silly idea.

41:50.106 --> 41:52.983
I'm afraid I won't be
available next week, Constable.

41:53.019 --> 41:54.411
I'm off to New York.

41:54.884 --> 41:57.454
But if circumstances
had been different...

41:57.528 --> 41:59.260
And who knows?

42:00.784 --> 42:02.753
Maybe one day, they will be.

42:13.690 --> 42:16.266
So you'll do all right
without your brother?

42:16.298 --> 42:17.775
I'll do fine.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.516
He was holding me back anyway.

42:19.568 --> 42:21.971
Someone like me needs the spotlight.

42:22.005 --> 42:24.207
No shortage of humility, I see.

42:24.239 --> 42:27.253
Humility is for those who
want to end up in second place.

42:28.377 --> 42:29.814
So Mr. Wattenberg,

42:29.989 --> 42:31.651
you're going to continue your search for

42:31.673 --> 42:33.166
who you are and where you come from?

42:33.230 --> 42:36.634
- Yes. I think I will.
- Good for you.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.244
Are you sure you don't want
to stick around tonight?

42:39.272 --> 42:40.935
I'm premiering my new schtick.

42:43.339 --> 42:45.706
Nope. I think I'll pass.

43:37.474 --> 43:38.768
Right.
