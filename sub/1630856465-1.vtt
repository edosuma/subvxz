WEBVTT

00:21.105 --> 00:23.857
James Trenchard, who started
at a stall in Covent Garden

00:23.941 --> 00:25.859
must get himself ready
to dance with a princess.

00:25.943 --> 00:26.993
What's he doing here?

00:27.069 --> 00:28.695
He's Wellington's main supplier.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.155
You're a bright man, Trenchard.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.491
You must use your talents well
when the wars are done.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.159
I gather you're Cubitt's man,

00:34.243 --> 00:35.994
responsible for turning
the streets of London

00:36.078 --> 00:38.205
into a white colonnade overnight.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.414
It is very gracious of you

00:39.498 --> 00:41.333
to invite us to your charming home.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.834
May I present my son,

00:42.918 --> 00:44.920
Mr. Oliver Trenchard and his wife.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.673
And I was on my best behaviour too.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.175
Yes, I bet your behaviour's
always pretty good, worse luck.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.260
Where shall we hold our next tryst?

00:52.344 --> 00:53.744
To hell with the lot of you!

00:53.763 --> 00:55.347
Oliver's spoiled...

00:55.431 --> 00:56.723
<i>Does he know what he comes from?</i>

00:56.807 --> 00:58.183
<i>But that's what you come from.</i>

00:58.267 --> 00:59.667
It's not what he comes from.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.229
My father has always wanted me
to be something I am not!

01:02.313 --> 01:04.439
<i>It is my fate to disappoint him!</i>

01:04.523 --> 01:06.024
<i>We'll be at Glanville next month.</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:07.526
<i>I hope you'll come down.</i>

01:07.610 --> 01:09.069
It's good to be back.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.029
Is it?

01:11.113 --> 01:13.031
You seem so well when you're here.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.783
I'm almost sorry we have to take you back.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.952
- How was it?
- As draining as death.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.081
I've seen a doctor, and I am pregnant.

01:21.165 --> 01:24.042
Eleven years with Oliver and nothing.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.877
- What could have changed?
- Whose is it?

01:25.961 --> 01:27.587
<i>Would you really want
to give your life to Glanville</i>

01:27.671 --> 01:29.214
if you had no one to hand it over to?

01:29.298 --> 01:30.757
I want my own child!

01:30.841 --> 01:34.594
If you want to be a father,
Oliver, this is the only way.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.128
But it's our secret?

01:36.138 --> 01:38.098
We have a box of secrets,

01:38.182 --> 01:39.308
you and I.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.685
- Do hurry.
- Oh...

03:38.469 --> 03:40.929
- Ah, Frederick!
- Good evening, Duke.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.181
Was starting to think
you'd evaded the net.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.016
Last time I saw you

03:45.100 --> 03:48.186
was at the opening
of the Royal Albert Hall.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.939
Noticed you'd bagged yourself
the best box,

03:51.023 --> 03:53.358
right in Her Majesty's sights.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.776
Paid a premium, did you?

03:54.860 --> 03:57.445
Not at all. But I was
one of the first to subscribe

03:57.529 --> 04:00.240
- to the building scheme so...
- Knows how to oil the wheels.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.117
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's in the blood.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.870
Met your grandfather once,
did I ever tell you that?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.913
- You did.
- Useful fellow.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.916
No-one could secure
a crate of fine Madeira

04:10.000 --> 04:12.919
faster than old Trenchard.

04:13.003 --> 04:17.549
<i>♪ I dreamt that I dwelt ♪</i>

04:17.633 --> 04:21.219
<i>♪ In Marble Halls ♪</i>

04:21.303 --> 04:28.268

05:09.768 --> 05:14.481

05:18.110 --> 05:19.861
Are we boring you, Frederick?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.112
I can never tell with you.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.198
I'm honoured to have
been invited, Duchess,

05:23.282 --> 05:24.533
as ever.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.453
Who is that girl?

05:28.537 --> 05:31.540
Ah, so you're not a monk after all.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.209
Her name is Clara Dunn.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.710
Exquisite, isn't she?

05:35.794 --> 05:37.003
Like a wood nymph.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.631
That's the mother and the elder daughter.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.299
And the father?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.885
Died, some months ago.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.553
The Duke has fond memories of him.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.847
He was a neighbour for a time.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.516
But he seems to have left his family

05:49.600 --> 05:51.852
in rather straitened circumstances.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.313
My goodness, Frederick,

05:55.397 --> 05:56.857
I do believe you're hooked.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.113
Miss Dunn...

06:04.782 --> 06:07.325
Might I present to you
a very dear friend of mine,

06:07.409 --> 06:08.827
Lord Trenchard.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.037
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

06:11.121 --> 06:13.071
He's been admiring your beautiful voice.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.834
Oh. Thank you.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.919
The Duchess tells me you've
recently arrived in London.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.255
Yes.
From Hampshire.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.549
We've taken a small house in Chelsea.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.844
My father died, you see, and...

06:25.928 --> 06:27.262
My condolences.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.891
I'm sorry--

06:32.267 --> 06:34.352
I haven't needed to say it out loud...

06:34.436 --> 06:36.604
He was my best friend in the world.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.107
We liked doing all the same things, so...

06:39.191 --> 06:41.026
Such as?

06:41.110 --> 06:42.736
Going for long walks,

06:43.362 --> 06:45.447
riding, exploring.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.532
- You like to ride?
- Very much.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.200
I'm not an expert...

06:49.284 --> 06:51.411
Would you care to ride
with me one day, Miss Dunn?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.579
Yes.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.705
Thank you.

06:53.789 --> 06:54.956
Good.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.458
I will speak to your mother.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.381
Quite the song bird,
Miss Dunn!

07:11.515 --> 07:13.433
What a peculiar gift.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.727
Hardly romantic.

07:15.811 --> 07:19.105
But look, Swaine and Adeney.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.441
I've heard they're the very best.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.901
Lady Harrow did say

07:22.985 --> 07:24.903
Lord Trenchard has money to spare.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.488
But no imagination.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.282
I think it's a thoughtful gift.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.576
And there's another one.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.495
That's so generous.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.292
Oh, it's perfect.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.461
- How did he--
- I did mention

07:41.545 --> 07:44.923
that you're without
suitable riding attire.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.091
Mother!

07:46.175 --> 07:47.592
Well, I didn't beg, dear.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.762
Well, begging would be
more honest than hinting.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.181
Oh...

07:53.182 --> 07:54.474
Clara...

07:56.101 --> 07:57.144
What?

08:00.939 --> 08:03.108
Cherish this moment.

08:03.192 --> 08:06.361
These moments are the making
of a young girl's life.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.631
It's called
The Serpentine...

08:26.715 --> 08:29.884
It was created by Queen Caroline
in the 1700s.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.302
Do people ever swim in it?

08:31.386 --> 08:32.470
Not intentionally.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.058
London is constantly surprising.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.992
It's certainly a city with many faces.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.021
Do you live in Belgravia,
Lord Trenchard?

08:42.105 --> 08:44.566
I do. In Eaton Square.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.859
My grandfather moved into the house

08:45.943 --> 08:47.652
soon after it was built.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.946
And are you happy there?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.656
You ask the most unusual
questions, Miss Dunn.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.868
Do I?

08:56.078 --> 08:57.328
I hope you don't think me forward.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.414
No. Not at all.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.208
I admire your curiosity.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.334
Perhaps we should start back,

09:03.418 --> 09:05.086
your sister will be waiting.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.838
Not yet. Please.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.590
Let's find a stretch where we can gallop.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.008
You're sure?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.051
Perfectly.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.558
Ah.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.526
Sorry.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.945
Don't be.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.598
Would you ride with me again soon?

09:35.867 --> 09:36.994
Friday, perhaps?

09:37.828 --> 09:39.370
Or, next week

09:39.454 --> 09:40.954
- if Friday seems too--
- Friday.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.582
Yes.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.211
- Friday?
- It was his suggestion.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.629
You should have said no.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.214
One can't appear keen.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.425
Well, I can't wait to see him again.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.218
I am keen.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.220
Oh, God.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.096
Do you think you could like him, Emily?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.973
Oh, I've no idea.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.434
I hardly know him.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.644
Nor do you.

10:02.728 --> 10:06.064
In honesty,
I think he seems proud.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.567
Actually, there's a shyness in him,

10:09.651 --> 10:11.236
which is surprising

10:11.320 --> 10:12.904
and really rather lovely.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.988
Perhaps that could be mistaken for pride.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.784
If you say so.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.788
He's extremely handsome.

10:23.332 --> 10:26.126
At this point, I'm afraid
that's all I can offer.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.756
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

10:31.840 --> 10:33.967
I prefer wild flowers to any others.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.302
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.762
When I was a little girl,

10:37.846 --> 10:40.307
I picked a whole armful
of field poppies once...

10:41.433 --> 10:44.185
Red and yellow, orange.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.105
I wanted to take them home to my mother.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.816
By the time I got home,
they'd all but died.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.402
I was devastated.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.363
My parents tried to cheer me up,

10:55.447 --> 10:56.614
but I couldn't get over the thought

10:56.698 --> 10:58.033
that I'd harmed them.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.244
That I'd loved them too much.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.039
I haven't picked any since.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.336
Sorry...

11:10.087 --> 11:12.046
I've confounded you again.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.174
No. Well...

11:14.633 --> 11:15.842
Yes.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.803
In the best possible way.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.473
I have a vivid picture of you now,

11:22.557 --> 11:24.157
holding the flowers in your arms.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.909
<i>Algernon Dunn.</i>

11:33.985 --> 11:35.320
Charming man.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.571
Well-read, too.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.073
Neighbour of ours in Kent
when I was a boy.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.659
I remember him coming
to balls at the house.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.910
Taught me to whistle.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.746
Amused me no end.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.206
Moved to Hampshire,
inherited a small estate.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.000
So you hadn't seen him for some time?

11:49.084 --> 11:50.668
He was at my father's funeral.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.547
He wrote to me a few weeks
before his own death.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.590
Touching.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.592
Intimated that he was worried
about his little family,

11:57.676 --> 11:59.428
the Estate in Hampshire is entailed.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.779
Did you meet Mrs Dunn?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.098
Briefly.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.683
Yes.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.060
But with a warm heart,

12:07.144 --> 12:10.521
I believe they found
the greatest joy in one another.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.689
Can I take it from all this

12:11.773 --> 12:13.473
that you're serious about the girl?

12:14.651 --> 12:15.777
You are.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.695
Good for you.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.822
About time.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.200
- Do you think she'll have me?
- Have you?

12:22.284 --> 12:23.884
Of course she will!
Heavens, man!

12:24.870 --> 12:26.704
Wait till I tell the Duchess.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.374
You do realise there's
no dowry to speak of?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.376
Well, that doesn't concern me.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.419
I've always hoped for a wife I can love,

12:33.503 --> 12:35.403
not one to whom
I should feel indebted.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.257
Frederick, Frederick.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.677
What a curious fellow you are.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.118
<i>Can I play, Father?</i>

12:59.029 --> 13:00.280
Show me what you've got.

13:08.997 --> 13:12.083
My, erm, girls are all I have, er,

13:12.167 --> 13:16.337
Lord Trenchard, since my dear,
dear husband was, erm,

13:16.421 --> 13:19.132
well, taken so, so suddenly last year...

13:19.216 --> 13:20.925
I was sorry to hear of your loss.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.468
His "Happy Band",

13:22.552 --> 13:24.095
that's what he used to call us.
I mean, there are some men

13:24.179 --> 13:26.347
who would have harped on
having a son, but not him.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.831
He was content with his girls
and that suited me.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.601
I mean, there are women
ruined with babies,

13:30.685 --> 13:34.105
don't you think? They say
that poor Mrs Charles Dickens

13:34.189 --> 13:35.314
was quite finished after her nine,

13:35.398 --> 13:38.693
she never moved from her bed more grub

13:38.777 --> 13:40.577
- than, than, than woman--
- Mrs Dunn--

13:40.612 --> 13:43.012
We were quite, erm,
satisfied with our girls and,

13:43.031 --> 13:46.534
and they have known nothing
but love their whole lives--

13:46.618 --> 13:48.328
- Mrs Dunn.
- And...

13:50.539 --> 13:51.789
Yes?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.334
What can he be saying?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.379
Very little, knowing mother.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.510
It's unbearable.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.053
Ooh! Ah!

14:09.307 --> 14:10.684
Wait, wait, wait.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.812
Oh. Oh, my dearest, dearest girl!

14:27.659 --> 14:30.077
If we might have a moment alone?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.205
Oh, yes! Yes. Yes, of course.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.212
Miss Dunn.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.924
I'm aware our acquaintance has been brief,

14:43.008 --> 14:46.010
but over these last few weeks
I feel I have...

14:46.094 --> 14:47.644
Come to know something of you...

14:48.471 --> 14:49.723
Of your nature.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.516
And...

14:51.600 --> 14:53.393
I find that
I think of you with...

14:56.354 --> 14:57.396
I think of you.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.942
And I am decided...

15:02.944 --> 15:04.195
Miss Dunn, would you do me the honour

15:04.279 --> 15:06.072
of becoming Lady Trenchard?

15:06.156 --> 15:08.825
In short of, well, of becoming my wife?

15:09.618 --> 15:12.203
Yes, yes. Oh, yes!

16:47.382 --> 16:49.342
<i>Buonasera.</i>
Can I interrupt, please?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.513
For the beautiful
Lady of the Lake.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.349
Oh!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.559
Thank you.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.686
Frederick...

17:02.605 --> 17:04.023
May I?

17:07.235 --> 17:08.570
<i>Grazie, senor.</i>

17:09.320 --> 17:10.363
<i>Grazie.</i>

17:15.493 --> 17:17.828
My first souvenir.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.705
The flattery is a ploy.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.989
I should have thought
you would realise that.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.419
Oh.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.212
Sorry.

17:27.756 --> 17:28.923
I won't keep it.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.174
Shall I have someone call him back?

17:30.258 --> 17:31.676
No. No, no.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.261
Of course you must keep it.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.346
Forgive me.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.639
I'm a jealous fool.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.776
I don't want to frighten you.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.789
I'm not frightened.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.461
This is what I want.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.090
You're not staying?

19:37.719 --> 19:38.887
Excuse me.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.699
Don't you think you'd better come in, boy!

20:05.121 --> 20:07.790
You have a rotten core.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.252
You have a bad soul

20:11.336 --> 20:12.545
which you can never...

20:13.421 --> 20:14.714
Escape from.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.759
You are...

20:18.927 --> 20:20.303
And always will be...

20:22.180 --> 20:23.306
Unlovable.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.074
Clara, I haven't always found life easy.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.579
I want to say this to you now...

20:50.667 --> 20:52.335
I've sometimes felt myself...

20:53.628 --> 20:54.754
Betrayed...

20:56.547 --> 20:57.897
By those I should count on.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.884
I'm not...

20:59.968 --> 21:02.720
believe me, soliciting sympathy.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.704
- Frederick?
- I want you to know that...

21:07.308 --> 21:08.643
Since meeting you, I've...

21:09.644 --> 21:10.770
Felt a sort of...

21:11.688 --> 21:12.814
Hopefulness.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.758
I want to be a good husband.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.696
I vow to you now that I will try.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.323
What do you mean,

21:22.407 --> 21:24.117
about feeling betrayed?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.728
Hello, my dear.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.274
Always a pleasure to see a new face.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.319
Miss Dunn.
I'm new to the Parish.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.654
Oh?

22:01.738 --> 22:03.280
Ooh, Miss White.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.783
And this, this is my sister,

22:05.867 --> 22:08.035
- Miss Hetty.
- How do you do?

22:08.119 --> 22:11.038
Oh, no, no, for many years.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.629
Oh, good. Look, Hetty.

22:18.713 --> 22:21.548
Reverend James is back from his retreat.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.301
We're <i>so</i> lucky to have him.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.511
Yes.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.306
I should say we are.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.599
And if you pay attention

22:30.683 --> 22:33.352
to the one who wears
the fine clothing and say,

22:33.436 --> 22:36.146
"You sit here in a good place,"

22:36.230 --> 22:37.982
while you say to the poor man,

22:38.066 --> 22:39.984
"You stand over there,"

22:40.068 --> 22:43.570
have you not then made
distinctions among yourselves

22:43.654 --> 22:46.407
and become judges with evil thoughts?

22:47.450 --> 22:49.201
We must always remember

22:49.285 --> 22:51.578
that some will have an easier path

22:51.662 --> 22:54.331
through this earthly life than others.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.292
For whatever reason that might be.

22:58.252 --> 23:01.171
But we are all equal in the sight of God...

23:01.255 --> 23:03.257
- Yes.
- Amen.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.758
The body of our Lord
Jesus Christ

23:04.842 --> 23:06.392
- which was given for you.
- Amen.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.612
Take and eat this in remembrance
that Christ died for you.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.728
And feed on him in your heart
by faith with thanksgiving.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.565
The blood of Christ.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.322
Mr. Fletcher, his lordship's valet.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.407
Your Ladyship.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.784
And if I may take the liberty,

23:30.868 --> 23:33.912
this is my good wife,
Mrs Enright.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.873
Mrs Enright is our cook.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.667
Congratulations, Your Ladyship.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.342
Thank you.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.057
Will there be anything else,
Your Ladyship?

23:53.141 --> 23:55.841
This portrait,
is this Lord Trenchard's father?

23:57.019 --> 23:58.521
It is, Your Ladyship.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.274
Did you know him?

24:02.525 --> 24:03.860
Was he a kind man?

24:05.153 --> 24:06.946
He was a fine man.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.326
The first Lord Trenchard.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.260
You've worked for the family
for a long time, Mr. Enright?

24:15.329 --> 24:17.290
Twenty-six years, Your Ladyship.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.960
How well you must know them.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.796
Yes.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.761
Glanville.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.346
Your country residence.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.809
This is Miss Davison.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.730
Davison has agreed to join us
as Your Lady's maid.

24:41.355 --> 24:42.732
Oh...

24:44.108 --> 24:46.027
Wait outside a moment, please.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.657
I took the liberty of asking

24:51.741 --> 24:53.283
if someone could be found for you.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.817
She has excellent references,

24:54.869 --> 24:56.453
and I needed to secure her at once.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.665
It's only that I assumed that I would...

24:59.749 --> 25:03.002
No. I want to surround you
with the very best people.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.048
I should have spoken to you first.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.175
Of course.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.553
- We can keep looking if--
- No, it's fine.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.807
So, a mistress.

25:16.891 --> 25:20.644
You'll have to share him now,
your precious Frederick.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.980
Maybe you'll even watch me sometimes

25:23.064 --> 25:24.356
instead of him.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.566
Foolishness.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.150
Whatever you say.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.912
You will find us a settled household,

25:38.996 --> 25:40.164
Miss Davison.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.999
His lordship likes everything by the book.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.084
Mmm. That suits me.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.336
My apologies,
Mr. Enright.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.173
This is Fletcher, the valet.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.593
Miss Davison is joining us
as Her Ladyship's maid.

25:53.594 --> 25:54.762
Good evening.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.349
Where was your last position
then, Miss Davison?

25:59.433 --> 26:02.227
I was with Lady Frances Paine
for eight years.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.396
- Why did you leave?
- Mawd!

26:04.480 --> 26:07.191
I'm only asking.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.693
She married and moved to the country.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.737
Middle of nowhere.
That's not for me.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.238
I like the city.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.699
Had enough of fields growing up on a farm.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.201
I agree.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.077
I had to live on a farm,

26:19.161 --> 26:21.705
in France, for ten years,

26:21.789 --> 26:23.707
- I couldn't wait to leave.
- France?

26:23.791 --> 26:25.042
What took you there,
Mrs Enright?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.960
Long story.

26:27.044 --> 26:29.046
It was my grandfather's place.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.964
Well, you were right to get out of there.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.848
Those Prussians have done for France.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.551
"Decimated," it said in my paper.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.387
No politics at the table.

26:37.471 --> 26:40.891
What's she like, the new mistress?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.935
She's young and she's a looker, Mawdie.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.228
What else is there?

26:44.312 --> 26:46.313
She seems too young to me.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.607
His Lordship was careful
to wait for the right lady.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.652
I'm sure
His Lordship has chosen well.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.367
I wasn't expecting you,
Your Lordship.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.923
Satisfying reading, eh?

27:13.007 --> 27:14.675
I was sure there was money
in that contraption

27:14.759 --> 27:17.135
- and it seems there is.
- It's a limited market.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.428
Agreed.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.597
But the return, you can't argue with that.

27:20.681 --> 27:21.974
Small, Ross.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.017
It's all small.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.936
Small is what we've always done.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.187
Small and sound.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.981
Why change the formula
if the whole point--

27:29.065 --> 27:30.315
Because we need to progress.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.277
Because I want something
on a larger scale.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.279
What happened to that steel
proposition you heard about?

27:35.363 --> 27:37.281
- It came to nothing.
- Did it?

27:37.365 --> 27:38.991
So, next time I'm at
the Chambers of Commerce,

27:39.075 --> 27:40.784
I won't hear people
boasting about their shares

27:40.868 --> 27:43.120
in a profitable new foundry
in Rotherhithe?

27:43.204 --> 27:44.454
You won't, Your Lordship.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.665
I have my nose to the ground.
You know that.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.126
I need you to do something for me.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.836
Set up an allowance, monthly,

27:50.920 --> 27:52.796
- for my wife's mother.
- How much for?

27:52.880 --> 27:55.340
Enough to cover her rent
and maintain standards.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.259
And a little more besides.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.053
Thank you.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.140
There's really no need
for you to accompany me.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.850
I'm only taking the air.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.518
And I do tend to walk quickly.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.552
But best if I'm with you,
Your Ladyship.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.732
Get him in!
Get him in!

28:14.235 --> 28:15.611
Get him in!

28:19.657 --> 28:20.824
Be careful!

28:20.908 --> 28:22.826
He bolted, your Grace...

28:22.910 --> 28:24.202
Should I send for Dr. Moorcroft?

28:24.286 --> 28:26.997
No. No. Fetch Dr. Ellerby.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.210
I'm sure that's the Duke
of Rochester's house.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.381
I don't know, Your Ladyship.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.512
<i>I hope you remember me.</i>

28:42.596 --> 28:43.847
<i>I'm Dr Ellerby.</i>

28:43.931 --> 28:45.224
<i>We met last month.</i>

28:46.267 --> 28:48.144
I've had such a busy morning.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.064
It's nice to sit down.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.610
We don't take enough time,

28:56.694 --> 28:57.736
do we,

28:59.196 --> 29:00.990
to simply sit and think?

29:03.284 --> 29:04.618
Listen to our breath.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.704
In...

29:11.667 --> 29:13.210
...and out.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.096
Like a breeze in the trees.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.590
In...

29:24.054 --> 29:25.597
...and out.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.064
<i>After a seizure,</i>

29:34.148 --> 29:35.998
<i>he will be particularly disorientated,</i>

29:36.066 --> 29:38.610
and he mustn't be
made to feel trapped or--

29:38.694 --> 29:41.446
But he can't be allowed
to run through the house,

29:41.530 --> 29:43.156
or onto the street.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.840
Dawes does have instructions
to keep him in his room.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.744
Your Grace,

29:47.828 --> 29:49.121
since meeting your son,

29:49.205 --> 29:51.665
I've been doing some research.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.293
There are some innovative
treatments for epilepsy,

29:55.002 --> 29:57.337
natural, humane regimes.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.297
Fresh air, exercise,

29:59.381 --> 30:00.631
the use of hydrotherapy--

30:00.674 --> 30:04.594
Which would require him
to be sent away, surely?

30:04.678 --> 30:06.596
That's precisely what I wish to avoid.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.098
But aspects of those treatments

30:08.182 --> 30:10.976
are achievable even if he remains here.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.648
I also think he would benefit
from a little more society.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.817
He has brothers and sisters, does he not?

30:19.443 --> 30:20.819
Yes.

30:20.903 --> 30:24.156
I do understand why you might
choose to keep him alone.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.659
It is not my choice,
Dr. Ellerby...

30:28.869 --> 30:30.496
He is our eldest son.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.665
You understand?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.834
If he can't be cured,

30:35.918 --> 30:37.669
I need hardly explain

30:37.753 --> 30:41.298
the devastating consequences
for the future of the Dukedom.

30:41.382 --> 30:43.216
For the whole family.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.844
I'm sure you appreciate
why the Duke is determined

30:45.928 --> 30:49.181
that Peter's illness should not
become common knowledge.

31:08.659 --> 31:09.993
Enright.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.244
How are you?

31:11.328 --> 31:13.706
Well. Thank you, Master J...

31:14.915 --> 31:15.999
Reverend Trenchard.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.083
You may call me Mister James if you wish,

31:19.086 --> 31:20.212
like old times.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.840
Is my brother at home?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.884
I'm afraid His Lordship is out, sir.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.386
Ah.

31:29.430 --> 31:31.181
I read the announcement of his marriage,

31:31.265 --> 31:33.265
I'd like him to know he's in my thoughts.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.604
I'll see that he gets it, sir.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.397
Thank you.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.234
Good day, Enright!

31:46.488 --> 31:49.407
But this boy wasn't one
of the Rochesters' children,

31:49.491 --> 31:51.618
or at least not the ones I've seen.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.037
And he seemed frightened.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.623
I'm sure it was nothing.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.003
- Yes.
- I hope Davison walked with you?

32:02.338 --> 32:03.547
She did.

32:03.631 --> 32:04.756
You know there is always a carriage

32:04.840 --> 32:06.049
at your disposal?

32:06.133 --> 32:07.884
You'll never need find your own way.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.318
But I love to walk,

32:09.845 --> 32:10.929
you know that.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.730
You mustn't worry about me, Frederick.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.264
What do you mean?

32:22.858 --> 32:25.068
I suppose I mean...

32:25.152 --> 32:27.904
That I'm stronger than you think I am.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.282
I can't bear the thought
of you coming to any harm.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.492
I won't.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.288
Please trust me.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.459
I do.

33:12.574 --> 33:13.867
<i>James?</i>

33:14.785 --> 33:15.994
<i>James, where are you?</i>

33:18.372 --> 33:20.022
Oh, James!

33:21.417 --> 33:23.376
You're a strong boy.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.586
Oh.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.172
Excellent, James.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.882
It's Freddie's turn!

33:29.717 --> 33:31.117
Freddie now...

33:50.821 --> 33:53.198
Look at me.

33:53.282 --> 33:57.035
You will be astonished
at how much you can bury,

33:57.119 --> 33:59.913
where no-one ever sees.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.333
Never...

34:03.417 --> 34:04.501
Ever...

34:04.585 --> 34:05.586
Cry.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.184
Thank you, Gentlemen.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.394
It's no trouble at all.

34:22.478 --> 34:23.645
So grateful...

34:30.944 --> 34:32.571
Go on! Go on!

34:32.988 --> 34:33.989
Forward.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.700
Yeah.

34:36.784 --> 34:37.867
Forward.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.202
Forward.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.620
What are you doing?

34:40.704 --> 34:42.304
Move out of the way.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.291
Are you all right?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.294
Miss?

34:48.378 --> 34:50.547
Miss? Can you hear me?

34:50.631 --> 34:51.757
Allow me to help.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.759
- Oh.
- Miss?

34:54.843 --> 34:57.637
- Do you know her?
- No. I, I saw her step out.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.621
Let's move her into the church.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.309
There's a doctor on the way.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.102
Poor girl.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.104
Yes,

35:06.980 --> 35:07.940
poor...

35:08.690 --> 35:09.691
Plain...

35:10.359 --> 35:12.402
Desperate girl.

35:12.486 --> 35:14.863
Thank you for everything
that you did, Miss?

35:15.697 --> 35:16.781
Dunn.

35:16.865 --> 35:17.991
James Trenchard.

35:18.075 --> 35:19.242
I'm the vicar here.

35:19.326 --> 35:20.702
Did you say Trenchard?

35:22.079 --> 35:24.456
You aren't, perhaps,
related to Lord Trenchard?

35:24.540 --> 35:25.541
Yes.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.034
I'm his younger brother.

35:28.669 --> 35:29.669
His only brother.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.796
What an extraordinary coincidence.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.174
My sister is Clara Dunn.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.092
Ah.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.511
How strange that we haven't met.

35:38.595 --> 35:39.846
Weren't you at the wedding?

35:39.930 --> 35:42.265
- Unfortunately--
- You should have held it here.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.934
But why didn't you officiate.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.437
- Prior engagement...
- What a pity.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.189
Your only brother's wedding.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.027
I'm going to ask the cab driver
to see you home, Miss Dunn.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.112
I'm... I'm sure somebody
is worrying about you.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.531
Oh. Only my mother.
No-one else.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.366
And you yourself have had a dreadful shock

36:00.450 --> 36:02.535
- seeing what you saw.
- Oh...

36:02.619 --> 36:04.788
I will accept your chivalrous offer.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.956
But I'll come back soon?

36:07.040 --> 36:09.190
I'd like to know what happens to the girl...

36:09.209 --> 36:10.627
Of course.

36:10.711 --> 36:12.462
- Come on, lads.
- Come on. Keep going.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.800
- It's in.
- Push it in.

36:16.884 --> 36:18.134
It should be brought through the back!

36:18.218 --> 36:19.719
It won't fit round the back!

36:19.803 --> 36:21.805
<i>It was the largest safe I've ever seen.</i>

36:21.889 --> 36:23.389
<i>Well, it would be.</i>

36:23.432 --> 36:25.308
So you know who's taken the place?

36:25.392 --> 36:28.478
I do indeed.
The Marquise d'Atagnac.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.231
- Heard of her?
- The name is familiar.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.566
She's one of the richest women in Europe.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.819
The Duchess and I met her once in Paris.

36:35.903 --> 36:36.986
At the Rothschilds',

36:37.070 --> 36:38.530
before the damned war, of course.

36:38.614 --> 36:41.032
I hear she had to clear out
in quite a hurry.

36:41.116 --> 36:44.160
But she's chosen to come here,
which is very much our gain.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.870
Where is her money from?

36:45.954 --> 36:48.004
She inherited most of it from her husband,

36:48.081 --> 36:49.916
the rest she accrued herself.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.334
It's extraordinary.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.378
Apparently, she has a staggering
range of investments.

36:53.462 --> 36:54.671
In what?

36:54.755 --> 36:55.880
You should ask her yourself.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.423
I'd very much like to meet her.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.592
And so you shall.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.136
Oh, blast.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.103
Thank you, Davison.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.691
There was never anyone so beautiful.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.248
Frederick...

37:55.482 --> 37:57.132
I wish I could give you the world.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.078
That's the Marquise.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.915
Quite something, isn't she?

38:11.999 --> 38:13.082
Now, my dear,

38:13.166 --> 38:14.916
let me introduce you to some people.

38:15.669 --> 38:16.753
After the Marquise,

38:16.837 --> 38:18.637
you're the subject of most curiosity.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.632
The lucky young lady

38:20.716 --> 38:23.259
who succeeded in capturing
Lord Trenchard's heart.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.593
<i>Did you see any of the blighters?</i>

38:25.887 --> 38:27.138
Of course.

38:27.222 --> 38:30.016
My house is only a few yards
from the barricades,

38:30.100 --> 38:32.769
Avenue de la Grande Armee, which is ironic

38:32.853 --> 38:35.813
seeing as our "Grande Armee"
was nowhere to be seen.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.273
Did they come near you?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.025
They broke into my house.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.151
Eight of them,

38:40.235 --> 38:41.945
armed with knives and muskets.

38:42.029 --> 38:43.780
How terrifying!

38:43.864 --> 38:45.949
Not at all.
I introduced myself

38:46.033 --> 38:48.368
and showed them
straight to my wine cellar,

38:48.452 --> 38:50.662
where they drank themselves unconscious.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.956
- Fools!
- Oh, far from it.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.625
They opened only my finest bottles.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.170
These "Communards" are not fools.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.214
They are passionate young people

39:01.298 --> 39:03.299
with a vision for France.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.302
For me, they are welcome
to change the world

39:06.386 --> 39:07.804
only not with my fortune.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.389
And how did you get out, Madame?

39:09.473 --> 39:12.225
We heard the poor Empress
had to run for her life.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.060
We left in the middle of the night.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.646
There were barriers
on the roads, of course,

39:16.730 --> 39:20.483
but even passionate
young people can be bribed.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.360
And those who couldn't be, well...

39:22.444 --> 39:24.780
Monsieur Nicoli can be very persuasive.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.531
He is Corsican.

39:31.787 --> 39:34.247
Commerce and the British aristocrat,

39:34.331 --> 39:35.915
I thought they did not mix.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.334
My family has always
believed in hard work.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.254
Once, it was a necessity
and now it is a choice.

39:41.338 --> 39:43.506
And what business are you in?

39:43.590 --> 39:45.508
What isn't he in?

39:45.592 --> 39:47.927
I have a portfolio of interests,

39:48.011 --> 39:50.221
imports, supply, small-scale engineering.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.015
And I've recently moved into railways.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.851
I invested a great deal in railways,

39:54.935 --> 39:57.687
ten, 15 years ago.

39:57.771 --> 39:59.939
Now the returns are good, of course,

40:00.023 --> 40:02.525
but I no longer touch railways.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.862
Too many fraudulent schemes and failures.

40:05.946 --> 40:09.866
I expect you will realise that
for yourself in time.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.200
What do you invest in now

40:11.284 --> 40:12.684
if you don't mind my asking?

40:13.787 --> 40:16.122
We must talk further, you and I.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.749
We must.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.752
I was going to say you should
come to the club, <i>madame,</i>

40:20.836 --> 40:22.504
- but, er...
- Perhaps I will.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.049
Perhaps I will disguise myself as a man

40:26.133 --> 40:28.384
and come and drink whisky with you.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.428
Oh, yes, now there's an idea!

40:58.331 --> 40:59.831
Did you know me straight away?

41:02.669 --> 41:04.129
You can change your name...

41:06.047 --> 41:07.632
You can change your accent...

41:11.428 --> 41:13.013
But you can't change your eyes.

41:16.850 --> 41:19.978
You were only 14, 15 when I last saw you.

41:20.729 --> 41:22.189
Fifteen...

41:28.737 --> 41:30.446
I just need to know if you are gonna tell

41:30.530 --> 41:31.865
any part of my story.

41:33.617 --> 41:34.784
Because if you are,

41:34.868 --> 41:36.161
I will look to move on.

41:38.205 --> 41:39.622
I've spent 20 years

41:39.706 --> 41:41.165
building a wall between that boy I was

41:41.249 --> 41:42.584
and what I am now.

41:46.421 --> 41:47.471
So give me two weeks,

41:49.049 --> 41:51.599
time to start looking
for another position at least.

41:56.473 --> 41:59.142
You were a sweet boy.

41:59.226 --> 42:02.520
I remember we all liked it
when you came in the kitchens.

42:03.813 --> 42:04.856
Cheerful.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.192
Helpful.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.367
What those men did to you
that night was abhorrent.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.705
I don't care what you'd done or who with.

42:20.789 --> 42:22.540
I don't care what you were,

42:23.583 --> 42:25.418
or what you are now, come to that.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.590
I want to say two things...

42:34.010 --> 42:36.345
No-one will ever hear a single word

42:36.429 --> 42:37.806
about your past from me.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.269
And I want you to know that I'm ashamed.

42:43.937 --> 42:45.104
And I have been ever since,

42:45.188 --> 42:46.982
that I didn't step in and stop them.

42:47.941 --> 42:48.942
Those...

42:49.484 --> 42:50.819
Bastard men!

42:52.654 --> 42:53.655
Bullies!

42:56.700 --> 42:58.250
You couldn't have stopped them.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.203
You were barely older than me--

43:00.287 --> 43:02.371
I could have tried.

43:02.455 --> 43:03.956
All of us, in the servants' hall,

43:04.040 --> 43:05.333
we could have tried.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.298
I thought they were gonna kill ya.

43:13.341 --> 43:14.592
They did...

43:16.970 --> 43:18.096
In a way.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.332
Where would you like to go?

43:31.735 --> 43:33.569
Madame.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.697
Anywhere else, <i>n'est-ce-pas?</i>

43:36.239 --> 43:37.323
Don't worry,

43:37.407 --> 43:40.451
I often feel the same way.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.954
I was just letting my imagination wander.

43:45.332 --> 43:46.791
No. Thank you.

43:57.510 --> 43:58.678
And you are?

43:58.762 --> 44:01.639
Apart from the most
enchanting creature here.

44:01.723 --> 44:03.099
- Clara.
- Oh!

44:03.183 --> 44:05.101
I knew a Clara once.

44:05.185 --> 44:06.811
She trained as an architect

44:06.895 --> 44:09.438
and designed a palace
for the King of Portugal.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.776
What is your connection
to <i>les chers</i> Rochesters, Clara?

44:13.860 --> 44:15.861
I'm married to Lord Trenchard.

44:15.945 --> 44:18.197
You don't look old enough to be married.

44:18.281 --> 44:19.824
I'm not sure that I am.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.576
You haven't been married long?

44:22.535 --> 44:23.745
Six weeks.

44:25.205 --> 44:26.539
Do you live close by?

44:27.374 --> 44:29.000
In Eaton Square.

44:29.084 --> 44:31.002
<i>Alors,</i> we are neighbours.

44:31.795 --> 44:33.713
Good. We can be friends.

44:33.797 --> 44:36.465
Yes. I'd like that...

44:36.549 --> 44:38.175
Lord Trenchard.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.344
We have just been discussing you.

44:40.428 --> 44:44.349
Has he met your expectations
of a husband so far, Clara?

44:46.559 --> 44:48.686
- She hesitates.
- No, I...

44:49.437 --> 44:51.230
Yes, of course.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.316
You must,

44:53.400 --> 44:54.900
what is it you English say,

44:54.984 --> 44:56.778
pull up your socks.

45:00.490 --> 45:03.368
We weren't discussing you
at all. Please don't worry.

45:04.577 --> 45:07.413
Frederick?
She was joking, I think.

45:07.497 --> 45:08.706
We should leave.

45:10.417 --> 45:13.044
There's no need at all
for us to leave. Frederick?

45:23.430 --> 45:25.098
Please allow us a moment.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.701
I would never, ever say

45:45.785 --> 45:48.079
anything critical of you to someone else.

45:49.164 --> 45:51.540
She drew me into conversation.

45:51.624 --> 45:54.585
She was teasing you, that's all.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.712
I honestly feel
you're making too much of this.

45:56.796 --> 45:58.714
That woman is extremely important to me

45:58.798 --> 46:00.257
and you humiliated me in front of her.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.967
I didn't. I promise.

46:02.051 --> 46:03.636
She knew what I meant.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.970
- Frederick.
- Do you have any idea

46:05.054 --> 46:07.264
how hard I've had to work
to earn my place?

46:07.348 --> 46:09.266
To succeed in the face of the sneers,

46:09.350 --> 46:10.893
and the snide remarks,

46:10.977 --> 46:12.228
"the merchant",

46:12.312 --> 46:14.063
"the tradesman's grandson made good"

46:14.147 --> 46:15.648
No-one sees you like that.

46:15.732 --> 46:17.108
No-one.

46:17.192 --> 46:20.736
You are held in the highest esteem by...

46:20.820 --> 46:23.322
Frederick, you are far
too hard on yourself.

46:23.406 --> 46:25.116
- Why do you--
- Stop telling me what I am!

46:25.200 --> 46:27.076
That isn't what I'm doing.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.285
I'm trying to help!

46:28.369 --> 46:30.069
I don't need your help!

46:30.747 --> 46:31.914
You ask me to trust you

46:31.998 --> 46:33.666
and this is what you do!

46:33.750 --> 46:35.043
I see.

46:41.174 --> 46:42.258
Clara, please...

46:42.342 --> 46:43.801
Where are you going?

46:44.844 --> 46:47.430
- Out.
- Clara?

46:47.514 --> 46:49.598
You can't go out.
Don't be ridiculous...

46:49.682 --> 46:51.142
Ridiculous?

46:53.853 --> 46:55.146
Clara, wait.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.524
Clara, I'm sorry. Don't go.

46:58.608 --> 47:00.458
- I can't stay here...
- Clara. Please--

47:02.028 --> 47:03.946
No, no, no...

47:04.030 --> 47:05.280
Clara...

47:06.866 --> 47:08.660
Are you all right,
Your Ladyship?

47:11.079 --> 47:12.371
Oh, God, no.

47:12.455 --> 47:14.206
I think we should send
for a doctor, Your Lordship.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.958
Yes, yes.

47:16.042 --> 47:17.043
Yes, we must.

47:18.211 --> 47:19.379
Clara?

47:20.630 --> 47:22.340
Do you know someone,
Your Lordship?

47:29.556 --> 47:30.806
For the Duchess.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.308
But her grace just retired...

47:32.392 --> 47:34.018
Lord Trenchard was insistent.

47:34.102 --> 47:35.103
It's urgent...

47:35.603 --> 47:36.688
And private.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.204
Lady Trenchard?

48:02.589 --> 48:04.256
I understand you've had a fall.

48:04.340 --> 48:05.883
I'm very sorry to hear that.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.600
Eyes...

48:15.977 --> 48:17.228
Can you see me clearly?

48:20.481 --> 48:21.732
Hear me?

48:21.816 --> 48:22.942
Yes.

48:28.865 --> 48:30.116
If I may?

48:39.125 --> 48:40.418
Thank you.

48:43.296 --> 48:45.946
If you could step outside
for a moment, Your Lordship?

48:58.144 --> 48:59.520
Can you lie flat for me?

49:09.989 --> 49:11.449
Is there any pain here?

49:13.743 --> 49:14.869
And here?

49:15.870 --> 49:17.163
How did you come to fall?

49:19.332 --> 49:20.792
Rushing on the stairs.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.257
My own fault.

49:35.890 --> 49:38.393
Her Ladyship will recover,
but she'll need to rest.

49:39.519 --> 49:41.437
I'll send something for the pain.

49:41.521 --> 49:43.272
But I'd like to see her again in two days.

49:43.356 --> 49:44.315
Thank you.

50:05.211 --> 50:07.811
<i>I believe I know
what you're thinking, sir.</i>

50:09.632 --> 50:11.008
But it was an accident.

50:11.718 --> 50:13.844
I saw it happen.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.013
There's nothing like that going on here.

50:20.435 --> 50:21.769
I'll be back.

50:23.062 --> 50:24.063
Good night.
