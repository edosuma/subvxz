WEBVTT

00:07.130 --> 00:08.296
Now take a moment

00:08.331 --> 00:11.304
and think about the most important events
between a child and her parents.

00:11.339 --> 00:13.100
Watching her take
those precious first steps.

00:13.135 --> 00:15.776
- Teaching her how to swim.
- Hoping she has her mother's buoyancy.

00:15.811 --> 00:17.297
Dropping her off her prom.

00:17.332 --> 00:19.123
Standing outside
with night vision goggles.

00:19.158 --> 00:20.851
Even though Paul Doyle
was a gentleman?

00:20.886 --> 00:22.863
Yeah. His sweaty handshake
was like slapping a catfish.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.733
Remembering her first drive lesson.

00:24.768 --> 00:27.865
And thinking, "How did she get so big?
Where did all that time go?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.356
Shouldn't we be doing this
in her mother's car?"

00:30.391 --> 00:31.959
[Singing "Cat's in the Cradle"]

00:31.971 --> 00:33.631
Walking her down the aisle.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.720
Kissing her cheek.

00:35.722 --> 00:37.522
Letting her go for good.

00:37.524 --> 00:40.127
These are the milestones
that your children remember, too.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.392
The special times.

00:41.394 --> 00:43.803
The times spent with their parents.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.606
You guys are right.

00:47.167 --> 00:50.518
I am going to my daughter's
gay wedding.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.737
Yeah, you are! Who cares
if she's the one in the tux?

00:52.739 --> 00:55.223
- Or that they're both named Karen.
- Mazel tov.

00:55.225 --> 00:56.624
Now, you have a choice.

00:56.626 --> 00:57.742
You could go with another agency.

00:57.744 --> 00:58.776
But you'd be fools to

00:58.778 --> 01:00.815
because no one has
what we have to offer.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.347
A milestone campaign built
by a father-daughter team

01:03.349 --> 01:07.084
who've experienced all the milestones
we just talked about together.

01:07.086 --> 01:09.637
Except for walking down the aisle.
I'm not even seeing anyone.

01:09.639 --> 01:10.588
I hope she meets a nice guy.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.473
- Dad.
- Or a nice Karen.

01:12.475 --> 01:13.975
This sounds great.
We're in.

01:13.977 --> 01:16.594
- You two are perfect for this.
- Thank you.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.744
I'm going on a coffee run,
do you want...?

01:58.746 --> 02:01.203
- You're off coffee. You're on gossip.
- Oh, good.

02:01.238 --> 02:02.932
Because Gail in accounting
is pregnant

02:02.934 --> 02:04.967
and she doesn't know
who the father is.

02:04.969 --> 02:07.069
Really? Not that, them.

02:07.071 --> 02:11.424
Look, Claire, I think we both know
that-that what we have, uh...

02:11.426 --> 02:15.161
What we have is so much bigger
than space and time,

02:15.163 --> 02:17.163
which means
it can't be contained by it.

02:17.165 --> 02:20.199
That poor girl, she has no idea
she's being dumped.

02:20.201 --> 02:22.401
That's Claire from the third floor.
You call her Cheryl.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.587
Her name is Claire?
Why didn't you tell me?

02:24.589 --> 02:26.088
You don't like being corrected.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.141
ZACH:
You see my problem?

02:28.143 --> 02:30.393
- I hope things never get awkward.
- He is so good.

02:30.395 --> 02:32.912
If I had six months to live,
I'd want him to tell me.

02:34.064 --> 02:35.598
And there goes Andrew.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.435
He swoops in faster
than a pimp on a runaway.

02:39.437 --> 02:41.253
What? I know stuff.

02:41.255 --> 02:43.222
'Sup, ladies?

02:43.224 --> 02:44.357
Oh, gosh, what's this?

02:44.359 --> 02:45.892
Oh, my goodness, it looks like
the number of a young woman

02:45.894 --> 02:48.060
who's about to make a regret.

02:48.062 --> 02:50.029
Way to strike
while the iron's vulnerable.

02:50.031 --> 02:52.081
It's not my fault I have a gift
for comforting emotional women.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.934
- I'm one of seven sisters.
- You mean you have six sisters?

02:54.936 --> 02:56.202
That's what I said.

02:56.204 --> 02:57.770
It's why my shoulders
are so perfect to cry on.

02:57.772 --> 02:59.572
Neither too hard, nor too soft.

02:59.574 --> 03:00.873
They are just right.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.725
Like Goldilocks' shoulders.

03:02.727 --> 03:04.794
All right, I need to throw myself
into work

03:04.796 --> 03:06.612
to get over the pain
of this breakup.

03:06.614 --> 03:09.465
- You seem like you're gonna be okay.
- I know, Lauren, it's just hard.

03:09.467 --> 03:12.001
She works on the same floor
as that coffee shop I really like.

03:12.003 --> 03:14.503
And the foam on their macchiatos,
it's the perfect density.

03:14.505 --> 03:16.839
You just don't come across that
every day.

03:16.841 --> 03:19.258
It's better to have loved
and lost... a beverage.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.061
I'm trying to be here for you,
but it's not easy.

03:22.063 --> 03:23.312
I know. All right.

03:23.314 --> 03:24.814
- So what do you got here?
- I mocked up the print ad

03:24.816 --> 03:26.983
- for the new Crest campaign.
- Oh, I like the layout, Andrew.

03:26.985 --> 03:28.067
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

03:28.069 --> 03:29.268
Uh, where's the copy I wrote?

03:29.270 --> 03:31.771
Uh, I felt it hit harder
with just the image.

03:31.773 --> 03:33.906
I mean, they say a picture's
worth a thousand words,

03:33.908 --> 03:36.242
so it was kind of overkill
with your two tacked on.

03:36.244 --> 03:38.494
Yeah, but the slogan's
the whole thing here.

03:38.496 --> 03:40.279
You're losing the poetry
of the language.

03:40.281 --> 03:41.948
Uh, "Buy two"?
That's your poetry?

03:41.950 --> 03:44.450
Uh, the poetry is in what I didn't say.

03:44.452 --> 03:45.484
It used to read.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.485
"You Should Buy Two."

03:46.487 --> 03:48.788
- Mm.
- But this way it just sings.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.790
Okay, Lauren,
you're an assistant, right?

03:50.792 --> 03:52.541
So you're very close
to the common man.

03:52.543 --> 03:54.710
Which way do you feel
is most effective?

03:54.712 --> 03:57.964
Well, I'd have to say Zach's way
because you just called me poor.

03:57.966 --> 04:00.049
- Yeah.
- Hey, everybody.

04:00.051 --> 04:02.018
Guess what I have in my hand.
Hmm?

04:02.020 --> 04:04.003
- Obsolete technology.
- (Buzzes) Wrong!

04:04.005 --> 04:06.088
That colonoscopy video
you keep tricking us into watching.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.273
- I destroyed that.
- Not the one in 3-D.

04:07.275 --> 04:09.892
- Is it the Milestone commercial?
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, yes!

04:09.894 --> 04:12.228
Take anything off the top shelf.
(Laughs)

04:12.230 --> 04:15.114
Did the whole thing in two weeks
and now it's ready to show the world!

04:15.116 --> 04:18.117
And I'll finally be present at the birth
of something I'm proud of.

04:19.002 --> 04:21.420
Except you. You're cool.

04:21.422 --> 04:23.105
Are you guys always this secretive
about commercials?

04:23.107 --> 04:24.490
No, usually the art director

04:24.492 --> 04:26.492
and the copywriter pitch it
before they shoot it.

04:26.494 --> 04:28.477
But it's not based on your memory.

04:28.479 --> 04:30.162
No, but we had some
really good ideas.

04:30.164 --> 04:32.498
Andrew took
his Spanish teacher to prom.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.467
<i>Señora</i> Greenwald made me
an <i>hombre</i> that night.

04:34.469 --> 04:36.602
We slow danced to the theme
from <i>Friends</i>.

04:36.604 --> 04:37.970
That's where you got the <i>amigos</i>.

04:37.972 --> 04:41.807
- I am dying to see this commercial.
- Well, it's a reenactment

04:41.809 --> 04:43.726
- of me teaching her to drive.
- It's him trying to teach me how to drive.

04:43.728 --> 04:45.311
- It was crazy.
- It was hysterical!

04:45.313 --> 04:47.463
She had her braces just off...

04:47.465 --> 04:48.597
- You should tell it.
- No, you.

04:48.599 --> 04:49.632
No, really, seriously, you tell it.

04:49.634 --> 04:50.599
- No, no.
- No, go ahead.

04:50.601 --> 04:51.934
Are you sure? Oh, bless you.

04:51.936 --> 04:53.586
It was classic <i>moi</i>.

04:53.588 --> 04:55.354
Kind of sprung it on her really.

04:55.356 --> 04:56.522
- I was so not prepared!
- You were not prepared?

04:56.524 --> 04:58.841
I had just woken up in the back of that car
going, "Where are my clothes?"

04:58.843 --> 04:59.692
(Both laughing)

04:59.694 --> 05:01.093
Hey, but don't spoil it.

05:01.095 --> 05:04.363
Come to the focus group
and see the birth of my favorite child.

05:04.365 --> 05:05.364
It's just an expression.

05:05.366 --> 05:07.550
You know? You're the best.

05:10.087 --> 05:11.387
Oh, what are you doing?

05:11.389 --> 05:14.023
You know the sodium
at the bottom is the best part.

05:14.025 --> 05:17.193
Oh, my God!
I just figured out what you are.

05:17.195 --> 05:19.328
You're Zach's remora.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.830
- No, I'm not.
- I know, right?

05:20.832 --> 05:22.531
Do you guys even know
what a remora is?

05:22.533 --> 05:24.233
- Totally, it's the new Buick.
- You put it in your coffee.

05:24.235 --> 05:27.036
Oh, okay.
You guys do not watch Shark Week.

05:27.038 --> 05:28.504
Here, look. It's this.

05:28.506 --> 05:30.740
A remora, or a suckerfish,

05:30.742 --> 05:33.843
is a fish that attaches itself
to a shark.

05:33.845 --> 05:35.578
See? Wherever the shark goes,
the remora goes.

05:35.580 --> 05:38.314
Grooming him,
living off his leftovers.

05:38.316 --> 05:39.882
- That's not me.
- Uh, the chips?

05:39.884 --> 05:41.083
What about Claire?

05:41.085 --> 05:42.451
What? I'm gonna take her
out for a cup of tea.

05:42.453 --> 05:45.254
- That doesn't make me his fish.
- Ah, of course not.

05:45.256 --> 05:47.456
Hey, I think my hair's,
like a little funky today.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.524
It doesn't seem perfect.
I don't know.

05:48.526 --> 05:49.925
It's just this pesky bang.

05:49.927 --> 05:52.661
Oh, thank you, remora.

05:52.663 --> 05:54.730
No. This is not gonna be a thing.

05:54.732 --> 05:56.832
I think the shark decides
what the thing is.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.135
And I think the shark's an idiot.

05:59.137 --> 06:01.103
A shark's not even a mammal.

06:03.741 --> 06:06.450
MAN: (Over intercom) So, as you know,
you're here to screen a commercial

06:06.478 --> 06:08.210
the agency just completed.

06:08.212 --> 06:09.678
Afterwards,
we'll ask you some questions

06:09.680 --> 06:11.781
and invite you to fill out
a comment card.

06:11.783 --> 06:14.357
- And then we get lunch, right?
- Yes, then lunch.

06:14.419 --> 06:15.951
I'm sharing heartfelt memories
and Grizzly Adams

06:15.953 --> 06:17.686
is worried about lunch.
Where did you find him?

06:17.688 --> 06:19.355
- Soup kitchen.
- Ah.

06:19.357 --> 06:20.890
He's kidding.
You're kidding, right?

06:20.892 --> 06:21.857
Tell him you're kidding.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.492
I'm kidding.
I'm not kidding.

06:23.494 --> 06:24.960
- You're not kidding?
- I'm kidding.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.296
MAN: You know what we're
going to do today, honey?

06:27.298 --> 06:29.465
- What?
- Learn to drive!

06:30.067 --> 06:31.534
GIRL:
But we're on the Interstate.

06:31.536 --> 06:33.873
- Take the wheel!
- Dad, did you stop taking your meds?

06:33.908 --> 06:36.512
- MAN: Only for a couple of days...
- GIRL: I've never done this before.

06:36.547 --> 06:38.344
MAN: That's okay,
can't learn in the passenger seat.

06:38.379 --> 06:39.475
GIRL:
I don't know how to do this!

06:39.477 --> 06:41.010
Did this actually happen to you?

06:41.012 --> 06:44.380
- Uh, not exactly.
- Sydney had braces and I had a perm.

06:44.382 --> 06:46.615
Too much hair and teeth.
You know, ooh.

06:46.617 --> 06:48.784
GIRL: We're in the middle
of a motorcycle rally!

06:48.786 --> 06:50.777
MAN: That's right, if you drive here,
you can drive anywhere!

06:50.812 --> 06:53.422
- GIRL: Which one is the brake?!
- MAN: Got to figure it out.

06:53.424 --> 06:55.591
- I'm gonna listen to some music.
- Stop it, Dad!

06:55.593 --> 06:57.026
Why are you doing this to me?

06:57.028 --> 06:59.895
'Cause you never know what life
is going to throw at you!

06:59.897 --> 07:01.163
(Girl screams)

07:01.165 --> 07:02.832
MAN 2:
Allstate Insurance.

07:02.834 --> 07:06.235
Protecting you
through life's milestones.

07:06.237 --> 07:10.206
Okay, so what did we think
of the commercial?

07:10.208 --> 07:12.124
Aw, I thought it was hilarious!

07:12.126 --> 07:13.375
- Oh, yeah?
- So, why?

07:13.377 --> 07:15.327
'Cause that would never happen
in real life.

07:15.329 --> 07:17.819
- I was scared for the little girl.
- You were scared, okay.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.478
I think you were supposed
to be scared.

07:19.549 --> 07:22.055
Because he's a bad dad.

07:22.136 --> 07:24.703
- Okay, bad dad.
- Yeah, that's the point.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.938
"Bad dad"?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.590
That's not the point.

07:27.592 --> 07:28.757
It's not what we were going for.

07:28.759 --> 07:31.594
But I-I guess you could see it
that way.

07:31.596 --> 07:33.595
You don't see it that way,
do you?

07:33.915 --> 07:36.265
Either way,
it's a really funny commercial.

07:36.267 --> 07:38.417
Based on a hideously
traumatic experience.

07:38.419 --> 07:41.053
WOMAN: I think they wanted us
to think the dad was crazy.

07:41.055 --> 07:42.755
- Totally.
- You thought he was crazy.

07:42.757 --> 07:44.156
- It was hilarious.
- Hilarious.

07:44.158 --> 07:46.709
He's, like, the worst dad
in the world.

07:46.711 --> 07:47.877
Really great campaign.

07:47.879 --> 07:49.829
- You got a winner.
- Excuse me.

07:49.831 --> 07:50.946
I'm wondering
if we're missing the point here.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.198
Okay, you people are not allowed
in here.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.532
You're tainting my focus group.

07:53.534 --> 07:55.451
Are you the people who made
the bad dad commercial?

07:55.453 --> 07:56.752
Yes, I-I mean, sort of.

07:56.754 --> 07:58.570
I'm sorry,
I think you mean "best dad."

07:58.572 --> 08:00.122
Because he was teaching her
defensive driving.

08:00.124 --> 08:01.707
You know, all those distractions

08:01.709 --> 08:03.175
were to stress test her,
to bring out her best

08:03.177 --> 08:04.460
in the worst case scenario.

08:04.462 --> 08:06.212
You people would throw her
out on the road

08:06.214 --> 08:07.746
ill-equipped...
and you know what you get then?

08:07.748 --> 08:09.598
Dead daughter.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.933
Sure, it sounds nice
because of the alliteration.

08:10.935 --> 08:11.934
But I assure you it's not.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.302
It's like "killer clown."

08:13.304 --> 08:15.004
It's all fun and games
until you walk into a room

08:15.006 --> 08:17.089
full of busted balloons
and body parts.

08:17.091 --> 08:19.091
- Maybe we don't bully the focus group.
- Thank you.

08:19.093 --> 08:21.060
Okay, the only important thing
is they like the commercial.

08:21.062 --> 08:22.344
Okay, don't take it personally.

08:22.346 --> 08:23.395
- Right here, right here, look.
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.397 --> 08:25.464
"Great commercial.
Smart and funny.

08:25.466 --> 08:26.565
Love the bitchy daughter."

08:26.567 --> 08:28.868
It's about the bad dad,
not the bitchy daughter.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.786
You said those were anonymous.

08:30.788 --> 08:32.371
My word is no longer my bond.

08:32.373 --> 08:34.306
Can we agree we didn't raid a Mensa group
to get these people here?

08:34.308 --> 08:36.041
This is insane.
Look at this one.

08:36.043 --> 08:39.044
"If I were were that..."
Is that, that's "girl."

08:39.046 --> 08:41.246
"If I were that girl
I would've never driven again""

08:41.249 --> 08:43.399
And you drive all the time.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.034
Actually, I don't drive.

08:46.236 --> 08:49.271
I never learned.

08:50.123 --> 08:52.441
Hey, what about that pizza?

08:52.443 --> 08:54.293
Uh, no pizza,

08:54.295 --> 08:57.462
but there are tuna fish
sandwich halves and chips.

08:57.464 --> 08:59.064
No chips.

08:59.066 --> 09:00.566
No chips.

09:03.253 --> 09:05.454
Sorry.

09:05.456 --> 09:06.689
Hey, I don't understand.

09:06.691 --> 09:08.140
You have a driver's license.

09:08.142 --> 09:10.659
Just that fake one you took me
to get so I could buy beer.

09:10.661 --> 09:11.677
The beer was for me.

09:11.679 --> 09:13.262
Liquor store people can be so gossipy.

09:13.264 --> 09:15.147
How have you gotten
this far without driving?

09:15.149 --> 09:16.916
I-I've only ever lived in big cities.

09:16.918 --> 09:18.117
I just never really needed to.

09:18.119 --> 09:20.152
Or maybe you've always
lived in big cities

09:20.154 --> 09:22.421
because you were scared to learn.

09:22.423 --> 09:25.324
You weren't that scared.
We laugh about the story.

09:25.326 --> 09:26.875
Yeah, now.

09:26.877 --> 09:29.094
- But was pretty scared.
- No...

09:29.096 --> 09:30.963
I was.

09:30.965 --> 09:32.715
Actually, I was kind of terrified.

09:32.717 --> 09:34.350
Oh, my God,
this explains so much, Sydney.

09:34.352 --> 09:36.835
This was your trigger moment.
When it all started.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.404
When what started?

09:38.406 --> 09:39.772
Nothing.

09:39.774 --> 09:41.607
I'm doing that thing
where I give my honest opinion.

09:41.609 --> 09:43.508
You are great.

09:43.510 --> 09:44.843
I never knew you were scared.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.479
I mean,
scared enough to never drive?

09:47.481 --> 09:48.564
So that mug
you gave me was wrong.

09:48.566 --> 09:50.649
I'm not the World's Best Dad.

09:50.651 --> 09:52.017
Are all my mugs lies?

09:52.019 --> 09:54.036
Do I actually like Mondays?

09:54.038 --> 09:56.472
Dad, it's not that big a deal.
I repressed it.

09:56.474 --> 09:57.489
Yeah, that's healthy.

09:57.491 --> 09:59.959
There it is again.
I love your shoes.

09:59.961 --> 10:02.745
Can we please just drop this?

10:02.747 --> 10:04.363
I can't believe I said that.

10:04.365 --> 10:06.031
I hate kitten heels.

10:06.033 --> 10:08.083
Well, at least they distract
from the blouse.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.903
Tunic top, really?

10:10.905 --> 10:12.888
I know I had
an unconventional childhood,

10:12.890 --> 10:14.890
but isn't everyone's first time
driving scary?

10:14.892 --> 10:16.058
Mine was lovely.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.426
My sister Pam and I
practiced in the parking lot

10:17.428 --> 10:19.311
and then she bought me
bubble gum ice cream.

10:19.313 --> 10:21.897
I learned to drive when I was visiting
my uncle in Syria.

10:21.899 --> 10:23.715
He got shot by the military police

10:23.717 --> 10:26.101
and I was the only one around
to drive him to the hospital.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.237
Still I think
your experience was scarier.

10:28.239 --> 10:30.072
SIMON: Okay, everybody, lunch is over.
Back to work.

10:30.074 --> 10:32.408
We have to find a completely new
angle for the Allstate campaign.

10:32.410 --> 10:33.558
Come on.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.027
I thought the focus group
loved the bad dad ad.

10:35.029 --> 10:36.829
Bad dad, best dad, Baghdad...
Who knows where they landed?

10:36.831 --> 10:38.063
So much said in that room.

10:38.065 --> 10:39.832
- Come on, let's go.
- Well, we have all this data.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.566
Yeah, nine people in favor
of bad dad.

10:41.568 --> 10:43.902
One person:
"So hungry, where's the pizza?"

10:43.904 --> 10:44.903
So, go with best dad.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.672
Andrew, go find Zachary,
get on that.

10:46.674 --> 10:48.407
Lauren, do whatever it is you do.
Sydney, come with me.

10:48.409 --> 10:49.625
We got to go meet
with Allstate right away.

10:49.627 --> 10:52.044
- They're nervous about the budget...
- We're $10,000 under budget.

10:52.046 --> 10:53.578
And besides, I just made
the perfect sandwich.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.297
No one likes a braggart, missy.
Let's go!

10:55.299 --> 10:57.082
- I could've taken that with me!
- Nope.

10:57.084 --> 11:00.571
It's true, sandwiches are
specifically designed for travel.

11:04.190 --> 11:06.692
Why does Allstate want a meeting?
I'm starving,

11:06.694 --> 11:09.028
and all they're gonna have
is a stupid plate of wraps.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.479
The sneakiest of sandwiches.

11:10.481 --> 11:12.281
I mean, if wraps are so great,
what are they hiding?

11:12.283 --> 11:14.099
- I don't know.
- Wait. Dad, you missed the turn.

11:14.101 --> 11:15.067
No, I didn't.

11:15.069 --> 11:17.736
And what's with hating on wraps?
I had a lovely one the other day.

11:17.738 --> 11:19.705
Little hummus.
Went down quick,

11:19.707 --> 11:21.056
and then it got
really Beirut down there.

11:21.058 --> 11:22.274
So, wait, what are we...

11:22.276 --> 11:24.743
- There's no meeting, is there?
- No.

11:24.745 --> 11:26.879
You need a good
learning-to-drive memory.

11:26.881 --> 11:28.780
One that's not so scary.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.916
- Take the wheel! (Laughs)
- (Screams)

11:30.918 --> 11:33.502
That's a bad joke. I'm sorry.
No, no, no, come on, I'm sorry.

11:33.504 --> 11:35.254
Good memory starting now.

11:35.256 --> 11:36.780
- (Screams)
- (Chuckles)

11:36.874 --> 11:39.424
No, no. Starting... now.

11:41.323 --> 11:43.028
Oh, God,
I'm all sweaty and nervous.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.725
Now I know how you feel
when your probation officer comes around.

11:45.727 --> 11:46.776
You're doing great.

11:46.778 --> 11:49.428
Interesting choice, letting the car idle

11:49.430 --> 11:51.264
and having the Earth's rotation
do all the work for you, but...

11:51.266 --> 11:52.882
SYDNEY:
I'm mentally preparing.

11:52.884 --> 11:56.235
Well, how about a little driving music
to help take the edge off?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.304
(Marching band music plays)

11:58.306 --> 11:59.772
No marching band music.

11:59.774 --> 12:02.241
- Oddly, I don't find it comforting.
- Really?

12:02.243 --> 12:05.511
It find that's the only thing
that relaxes me on the way home.

12:05.513 --> 12:07.530
SIMON:
All right, there we go.

12:07.532 --> 12:09.715
This is lovely.
Very, very... It's...

12:09.717 --> 12:12.168
You don't need to slow down that much.
Try and pick up a little speed.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.419
- There we go.
- I need a little less help.

12:13.421 --> 12:15.538
Well, all right,
but just a little more speed.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.240
Okay, now we're coming
to the stop sign.

12:17.242 --> 12:18.457
We're coming to the stop sign.

12:18.459 --> 12:19.642
Do you see the stop sign?
Do you see the stop...

12:19.644 --> 12:21.327
You see... There it went.
That was...

12:21.329 --> 12:23.462
Whoa. Honey, don't worry about the bird.
He's gonna move.

12:23.464 --> 12:24.630
(Bird coos)

12:24.632 --> 12:27.016
Honey, the bird's gonna move.

12:27.018 --> 12:28.601
He's gonna move.

12:29.436 --> 12:30.503
He's gonna move.

12:30.505 --> 12:32.972
I honestly thought
he was going to move.

12:32.974 --> 12:35.281
- The idea is not to hit the people.
- Look, I-I know that.

12:35.310 --> 12:37.093
I think you have bloodlust
since you hit that bird.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.811
Now just don't...
Don't-don't...

12:38.813 --> 12:40.246
- Don't hit the person!
- I'm not going to!

12:40.248 --> 12:42.665
If it's my father voice
that's disturbing you...

12:42.667 --> 12:45.368
(French accent):
I will try to be maybe this guy...

12:45.370 --> 12:47.870
- Look up ahead...
- No, it's still disturbing.

12:47.872 --> 12:50.273
(Speaking French)

12:50.275 --> 12:51.874
English is better.

12:51.876 --> 12:54.093
Oh, no, no, no!

12:54.095 --> 12:56.746
(Screaming)

12:58.432 --> 12:59.966
SYDNEY:
Now?

12:59.968 --> 13:02.468
Not now.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.503
- SYDNEY: Now.
- SIMON: Not now.

13:05.505 --> 13:06.505
Now?

13:06.507 --> 13:07.673
Not now.

13:08.659 --> 13:10.993
- Now.
- Now! (Sighs)

13:10.995 --> 13:12.402
(Horns honking)

13:12.414 --> 13:14.614
Not now.

13:14.616 --> 13:16.315
So let me get this straight.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.367
The good ad about a bad dad
made Simon sad?

13:18.369 --> 13:21.037
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm a poet and I don't realize it.

13:21.039 --> 13:23.188
Okay, what about this?

13:23.190 --> 13:25.791
If we take the two types
of insurance coverage

13:25.793 --> 13:28.661
and draw circles around them
with intended targets in the middle...

13:30.030 --> 13:32.114
I drew boobs again.

13:32.116 --> 13:33.532
Whoa, no, come on.

13:33.534 --> 13:34.700
There's something here.

13:34.702 --> 13:38.337
Just have to look past the boobs
to see the good inside.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.257
I swear,
you boys are all the same.

13:41.509 --> 13:43.542
Oh, my God.

13:43.544 --> 13:45.411
I'm picking through your leftovers.

13:45.413 --> 13:46.896
Your ideas, your food,

13:46.898 --> 13:50.349
worst of all, Claire,
an actual human woman.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.235
Oh! You know who's the boob?

13:52.237 --> 13:53.603
I'm the boob.

13:53.605 --> 13:55.688
- The sad, sad boob.
- No, you're not...

13:55.690 --> 13:57.573
Lauren, let him have that.
He feels what he feels.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.776
Andrew, I think that you are
overlooking the benefits

14:00.778 --> 14:02.178
of this delicate ecosystem.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.081
Look, if you didn't finish my food,

14:05.083 --> 14:06.165
I'd get fat.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.950
Right? A-And if you didn't comfort

14:07.952 --> 14:09.785
these angry women,
I'd get killed in my sleep.

14:09.787 --> 14:10.987
Now come on.

14:10.989 --> 14:13.289
Let me see that adorable Andrew smile.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.874
- Mm-mm.
- That beautiful little...

14:14.876 --> 14:18.628
- Mm-mm.
- ...sweet, sweet child smile you have.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.780
Like a little boy. Huh?

14:20.782 --> 14:22.949
Hey. Hey, little guy.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.817
Hey. I got something for you.

14:24.819 --> 14:26.652
Bibbity-boop!

14:26.654 --> 14:27.853
Bop, bop, bop.

14:27.855 --> 14:29.622
(Laughs)
I can't stay mad at you.

14:29.624 --> 14:31.891
No! I'm mad at me.

14:31.893 --> 14:35.461
And I'm done being your remora,
picking through your leftovers.

14:35.463 --> 14:37.563
Start sleeping with both eyes open.
(Gasps)

14:37.565 --> 14:38.965
Like a shark!

14:38.967 --> 14:40.833
No! Not like a shark!

14:40.835 --> 14:41.801
Like a person...

14:41.803 --> 14:43.970
who sleeps... poorly.

14:44.939 --> 14:47.406
No, really,
that's how sharks sleep.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.208
Tell me about it.

14:49.210 --> 14:50.977
(Horns honking)

14:53.014 --> 14:54.080
SYDNEY:
Now?

14:54.082 --> 14:57.617
Now! Now, now.
Now, now, now, now.

14:57.619 --> 14:58.584
For the love of God, go!

14:58.586 --> 15:00.987
SYDNEY:
I am! I can't do this anymore!

15:00.989 --> 15:02.321
- Well, neither can I.
- Why are you mad?

15:02.323 --> 15:04.724
- I'm not, I'm just deflecting blame.
- No one is blaming anyone,

15:04.726 --> 15:06.158
but if there was someone to blame,
he's sitting in this car

15:06.160 --> 15:08.728
- and he's wearing your pants.
- Well, that could be anybody!

15:08.730 --> 15:11.631
Listen, maybe driving isn't
one of our best moments.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.599
But we had others.
I taught you how to swim.

15:13.601 --> 15:16.435
By throwing me in Lake Michigan
and telling me to find the shore.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.503
You found it.

15:17.505 --> 15:18.671
Apology accepted.

15:18.673 --> 15:20.106
What about that fun camping trip?

15:20.108 --> 15:21.407
You know, the one
up in Wisconsin that...

15:21.409 --> 15:23.492
Oh, the one where
you doused me in turkey urine

15:23.494 --> 15:24.760
to "mask my human scent."

15:24.762 --> 15:27.496
- Well, you wanted to meet a deer!
- Not during turkey mating season.

15:27.498 --> 15:28.964
Well, who knew that
turkeys were so sexual?

15:28.966 --> 15:30.449
There is no talking to you.
You're always right.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.835
"Always" is a bit of a stretch.

15:32.837 --> 15:34.453
(Sighs)

15:34.455 --> 15:37.673
I always thought that
I was the fun, cool dad,

15:37.675 --> 15:39.508
and I'd blame your mom for stuff,

15:39.510 --> 15:41.160
until my shrink said
I couldn't do that anymore

15:41.162 --> 15:42.995
and I had to fire him,
which was kind of a pain,

15:42.997 --> 15:45.965
because he was pretty liberal
with the prescriptions.

15:45.967 --> 15:47.633
The truth is,

15:47.635 --> 15:51.670
I didn't do anything
to help prepare you for life.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.255
I was just a scary, bad dad.

15:53.257 --> 15:56.192
- No. That's not fair.
- Stop.

15:56.194 --> 15:57.893
- No, it's not what I was saying, it...
- Stop.

15:57.895 --> 16:00.379
- Stop the car, we're rolling!
- Oh, God! Oh, my God!

16:01.448 --> 16:03.743
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- I'll handle this.

16:03.778 --> 16:06.068
- You can't prove anything.
- Oh, what the hell?

16:06.070 --> 16:07.803
Just tell your wife
to watch where she's going.

16:07.890 --> 16:10.689
My wife? How dare you!
That's is my daughter.

16:10.691 --> 16:13.893
Although my second wife was her age,
so I retract my indignation.

16:13.895 --> 16:15.828
Well, you scared my daughter.
It's her first time driving.

16:15.830 --> 16:17.046
Really? What a coincidence.

16:17.048 --> 16:19.185
I'm teaching my daughter
to drive, too.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.050
Why can't you drive yet?

16:21.052 --> 16:22.084
Aren't you, like, 40?

16:22.086 --> 16:24.170
No, I'm 30... something.

16:24.172 --> 16:25.221
- Same thing.
- No, sister friend,

16:25.223 --> 16:27.840
- it's not even close to the same thing.
- "Sister friend"?

16:27.842 --> 16:29.975
Listen, she can't drive
because the first time I taught her

16:29.977 --> 16:31.160
I sort of traumatized her.

16:31.162 --> 16:33.012
It's all a blur, really.
Without naming names,

16:33.014 --> 16:34.680
one of us was coming off
a three-day bender,

16:34.682 --> 16:35.981
the other was worried
about a chemistry final.

16:35.983 --> 16:37.683
You didn't traumatize me.

16:37.685 --> 16:40.552
- Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
- Yeah, your dad's a weirdo.

16:40.554 --> 16:42.822
- I prefer "nut job," or...
- Hey, hey!

16:42.824 --> 16:45.157
He is not a weirdo or a nut job!

16:45.159 --> 16:48.027
Okay, maybe he's both.
But that's good. I mean...

16:48.029 --> 16:50.496
How many kids do you know
who can pick a lock with a hairpin?

16:50.498 --> 16:52.539
- He taught me when I was nine.
- She's amazing.

16:52.613 --> 16:55.469
- Or how to always split aces and eights.
- Otherwise, the house wins.

16:55.553 --> 16:58.788
Or how to light a lady's cigarette.
You-you gently cup her hand...

16:58.790 --> 17:01.190
- While never averting her gaze.
- It's a dying art, really.

17:01.192 --> 17:02.925
What are you talking about?

17:02.927 --> 17:04.627
I'm talking about all the
things that I got from him

17:04.628 --> 17:07.930
that might seem crazy to you,
but that I wouldn't change.

17:07.932 --> 17:10.382
I'm creative and successful

17:10.384 --> 17:14.270
because I never knew a normal day
until I left home.

17:14.271 --> 17:16.663
And I owe it all
to this weirdo nut job.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.557
Really?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.608
Yeah. Really.

17:20.611 --> 17:22.795
Well, the good news is

17:22.797 --> 17:26.031
the cars aren't nearly
as damaged as you two.

17:26.282 --> 17:27.450
We can let it go.

17:27.452 --> 17:28.951
You're lucky.

17:28.953 --> 17:31.770
I am.

17:33.573 --> 17:35.624
Where did you learn that
Dukes of Hazzard thing?

17:35.626 --> 17:37.827
You're a much better driver
than your mother.

17:37.829 --> 17:40.162
Kind of.

17:46.503 --> 17:49.255
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

17:49.257 --> 17:52.641
I was just wondering if I could
take you up on that offer to talk.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.244
Um... Chin up.

17:55.246 --> 17:57.796
Look... These are not for you.

17:57.798 --> 18:00.483
I get that you're going through
a hard time right now,

18:00.485 --> 18:02.818
and I'm sorry, and I really wish
I could console you...

18:02.820 --> 18:04.320
- Okay.
- ...and other stuff.

18:04.322 --> 18:06.839
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm not that guy anymore.

18:06.841 --> 18:10.025
As a wise Spanish woman
told me some 15 years ago,

18:10.027 --> 18:13.458
"It's not you... it's yo."

18:14.298 --> 18:16.332
That went against
everything I stand for.

18:16.334 --> 18:18.084
Hey. How's it going?

18:18.086 --> 18:21.420
Andrew's fighting his basic instincts
and winning by losing.

18:21.422 --> 18:23.866
- Sounds like an ad for a Buddhist casino.
- Good news.

18:23.901 --> 18:26.134
We have decided to embrace
the "bad dad" campaign.

18:26.169 --> 18:27.414
The focus group loved it

18:27.453 --> 18:29.318
and we've got a million stories
from our lives.

18:29.353 --> 18:30.740
Like the time I taught you
to ride a bicycle.

18:30.765 --> 18:32.715
I always thought training wheels
were for losers.

18:32.717 --> 18:34.317
- I'm sorry, do you want to...?
- You want to tell it?

18:34.319 --> 18:35.601
No, no, just do it.

18:35.603 --> 18:36.652
You'll remember it better.
You weren't concussed.

18:36.654 --> 18:38.270
You were such a trooper that day.

18:38.272 --> 18:39.689
I remember wiping away the blood,
and there were

18:39.691 --> 18:41.607
- those blue eyes, looking up at me.
- They're green.

18:41.609 --> 18:43.142
Yes, they are, in this light.

18:43.144 --> 18:44.260
Zach, walk with me.

18:44.262 --> 18:47.079
We have to talk about all the ways
I've ruined my daughter's life.

18:47.081 --> 18:48.147
Oh, you know what, Simon?

18:48.149 --> 18:49.615
You have a little
schmutz on your back.

18:49.617 --> 18:50.666
SIMON:
Schumtz? Really?

18:50.668 --> 18:51.634
ZACH:
Yeah.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.668
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

18:52.670 --> 18:54.420
Yeah, and I totally agree.

18:54.422 --> 18:56.639
Those kitten heels are
doing her calves no favors.

18:56.641 --> 18:57.790
No.

18:57.792 --> 19:00.009
Zach is Simon's remora.

19:01.995 --> 19:03.746
Maybe everyone's someone's remora.

19:03.748 --> 19:05.915
ANDREW:
That's a beautiful thought.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.300
You know what else
is a beautiful thought?

19:08.302 --> 19:11.020
There's a woman on the third floor
who's weeping for these shoulders.

19:11.022 --> 19:12.972
And whatever else, you know,
that she wants to cry on,

19:12.974 --> 19:14.106
it's all welcome.

19:14.108 --> 19:16.726
It's better than me doing it
on myself.

19:22.666 --> 19:23.682
(Insects trilling)

19:23.684 --> 19:25.117
SIMON:
You okay, honey?

19:25.119 --> 19:26.202
I think I'm okay.

19:26.204 --> 19:28.204
- This is good.
- Yeah.

19:28.206 --> 19:30.623
We're nowhere near train tracks,
and this time, I brought food.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.707
There's no escaped convict
in the area?

19:31.709 --> 19:32.691
No.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.194
And the nearest turkey urine
is still inside the nearest turkey.

19:35.196 --> 19:37.546
(Owl hoots)
You can turn off the forest now.

19:37.548 --> 19:39.999
Okeydoke.

19:40.001 --> 19:42.305
(All forest sounds stop)
Night, honey.

19:42.871 --> 19:44.754
Do you think you can sleep?

19:44.756 --> 19:47.473
I think so. You?

19:47.475 --> 19:49.141
Well, this'll help.

19:49.143 --> 19:50.726
(Marching band music playing)

19:50.728 --> 19:52.812
There we go.

19:52.814 --> 19:54.397
Good night, baby.

19:54.399 --> 19:56.031
Good night, nut job.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.266
(Screams)

19:57.268 --> 19:59.351
Geez, there's a spider.

19:59.353 --> 20:03.316
Get it, get it, get it!
Oh... Got it. Good night, baby.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.074
Yes, what I have in my hand...

20:11.109 --> 20:13.130
That new colonoscopy.
No, it's not new.

20:13.165 --> 20:15.459
You got it a long time ago.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.588
And action!

20:21.186 --> 20:22.769
Landed on the ball.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.198
'Cause wait till you hear
what my first line is.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.570
"Neither too hard nor too soft."

20:27.605 --> 20:29.213
[Laughing]

20:29.889 --> 20:31.364
Did this actually happen to you?

20:31.399 --> 20:33.192
No, actually Sydney
was screaming way louder

20:33.227 --> 20:35.976
and I was wearing an "ass-cat", just...
"Ass-cat"?

20:36.676 --> 20:38.085
It was like...

20:39.195 --> 20:40.836
Oh, it was just a phase.

20:41.409 --> 20:42.689
Oh, no!
[Screaming]

20:42.724 --> 20:45.538
Sorry...
[Choking]

20:45.673 --> 20:48.868
Oh, my God.
I think I pooped myself.

20:49.399 --> 20:51.157
That was weird.

20:51.425 --> 20:53.715
I'm through being your remora!

20:54.397 --> 20:56.582
Where did you learn
that Dukes of Hazzard thing?

20:56.617 --> 20:58.380
Sunnydale.
