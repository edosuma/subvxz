00:04.463 --> 00:06.716
All right, Mabel,
today is the big day.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.758
Big day!

00:07.925 --> 00:10.303
Soos finally
fixed up the laptop.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.512
If this thing works,

00:11.678 --> 00:12.930
we could learn the identity
of the author

00:13.138 --> 00:15.516
and unravel the greatest
mysteries of Gravity Falls.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.558
You ready?

00:16.725 --> 00:18.443
Oh, I'm ready, baby.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.817
Ma-ma.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.117
This is it.
This is it.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.118
( Chuckles )

00:34.326 --> 00:35.122
It worked.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.955
BOTH: blip, blap,
bloobity bloop, twins.

00:38.872 --> 00:39.964
(alarm )

00:41.500 --> 00:44.299
Ugh!
Of course, a password.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.925
Don't you worry,
bro bro.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.099
With your brains
and my laser focus,

00:49.299 --> 00:52.223
there is literally nothing
that can distract us from...

00:52.427 --> 00:53.223
( piano music playing )

00:53.428 --> 00:54.520
Did you hear that?

00:54.680 --> 00:56.682

I've been dreaming ♪

00:56.890 --> 00:59.393

01:03.272 --> 01:05.775

01:05.983 --> 01:08.862
I finally understand
what all the buzz is about.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.241
Reading.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.997
Give me some
of that honey.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.619
( Kissing )

01:19.037 --> 01:20.630
Ba bump.
Ba bump.

01:20.831 --> 01:21.923
Oh, boy-

02:01.913 --> 02:03.540
( laughter and applause )

02:03.749 --> 02:05.126
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.462
Just when I was getting
over Mermando,

02:07.669 --> 02:09.842
of course, you show up
at my doorstep.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.049
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about Mermando.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.931
Did not care
for Mermandooo.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.512
Okay,
this cryptology book says

02:16.720 --> 02:19.189
there's 7.2 million
8-letter words.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.141
I'll type, you read.
Okay, Mabel?

02:21.350 --> 02:22.317
Mabel?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.780

stick our hands in... ♪

02:26.980 --> 02:29.153

02:29.358 --> 02:30.280
Hey, I'm Gabe Benson,
y'all.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.364
Goodnight.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.491
( Indistinct chatter )

02:33.695 --> 02:35.697
HEY, 900d job today,
YOU guys.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.453
You were late
on your cue.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.454
What?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.081
Hey, hey.
Be good to each other.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.586
We're all stars.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.913
Hey!
Guess who's Mabel?

02:43.080 --> 02:43.922
I am.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.334
Care to learn more?
I bet you do.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.542
You like to learn.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.547
( Chuckles )

02:48.752 --> 02:50.550
( screams )

02:50.754 --> 02:51.596
And I'm up.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.344
Oh, hey, I'm Gabe,
master of puppets.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.470
Nice to meet you.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.723
You're amazing
with those puppets.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.723
Really?

02:57.928 --> 02:58.929
A lot of people
think puppets are dumb

02:59.137 --> 03:00.935
or just for kids
or something.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.234
Are you kidding me?
I'm puppet crazy.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.402
People call me
"puppet crazy Mabel".

03:06.561 --> 03:07.437
Really?

03:07.646 --> 03:08.818
People used to call me
"puppet crazy Gabe".

03:09.022 --> 03:10.615
So when's your
next puppet show?

03:10.816 --> 03:11.658
My huh?

03:11.858 --> 03:12.780
I mean, you can't
truly love puppets

03:12.984 --> 03:14.452
if you're not throwing
puppet shows, right.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.654
( Nervous giggle )

03:15.862 --> 03:18.786
Yeah, I mean I'm totally
working on a puppet show.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.583
Oh,
what are the details?

03:20.784 --> 03:24.584
There are
so many details.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.675
( Sighs )

03:28.875 --> 03:29.751
So how'd it go?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.383
Dipper, how hard
do you think it would be

03:32.587 --> 03:34.806
to write and compose
a sock puppet rock opera

03:35.006 --> 03:35.802
with lights,
original music

03:36.007 --> 03:37.429
and live pyrotechnics
by Friday?

03:37.634 --> 03:38.476
( Beeping )

03:38.677 --> 03:40.224
What?
Mabel, are you serious?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.646
I don't know
what happened.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.599
I got lost in his eyes
and his ponytail

03:43.807 --> 03:45.400
and I'm going to be
so embarrassed on Friday

03:45.559 --> 03:46.981
if I don't have
anything.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.937
But what about cracking
this password?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.739
You know,
mystery twins?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.567
If you help me with this
for just a couple of clays,

03:53.775 --> 03:55.368
I promise I'll help you
with the password.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.321
Please.
Pretty please.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.157
It's for love, Dipper.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.951
All right, okay.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.753
Yes!
Thank you.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.206
This guy,
he's number one!

04:07.414 --> 04:08.290
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.545
Shh.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.878
Man, I can't wait to get to
the bottom of this laptop.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.215
We're close
to something big here.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.842
I can feel it.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.440
Ugh!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.478
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:31.480 --> 04:32.857
Come on.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.702
All right, the play
is going to be called

04:44.910 --> 04:47.459
"Glove Story-
A Sock Opera."

04:47.662 --> 04:49.881
Just a warning,
people's eyes will get wet,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.634
'cause they'll be crying
from laughing,

04:52.834 --> 04:54.757
from how tragic it is.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.297
Yeah, that...
that sounds great.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.301
( Coughs )

04:57.506 --> 04:58.428
Come on, Dipper,

04:58.632 --> 04:59.884
you just got to roll
with Mabel's craziness.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.718
It's what makes
life worth living.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.011
♪ Puppet boy,
puppet boy ♪

05:03.220 --> 05:04.688

05:15.607 --> 05:17.826
Wack, wack, wack, muaah.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.278
Soon, Gabe Benson.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.487
( Beeping )

05:20.695 --> 05:21.696
Ugh, wrong password.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.578
Wrong. Wrong! Ugh!

05:23.782 --> 05:24.783
Don't stay up
all night, Dipper.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.789
Last time you got
this sleep deprived

05:26.993 --> 05:28.370
you tried to eat
your own shirt.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.331
Bleh.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.508
Just a few more tries.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.675
( Beeping )

05:36.378 --> 05:38.426
Ugh!
I can't take that sound anymore.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.305
I hate you sound.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.762
There has to be
some shortcut or clue.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.893
Who would know
about secret codes?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.534
I think I know a guy.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.667
Well, well, well,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.791
you're awfully persistent,
Pine Tree.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.042
Hats off to you.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.832
( Dipper whimpering )

06:13.999 --> 06:15.046
You again!

06:15.250 --> 06:18.629
Did you miss me?
Admit it, you missed me.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.259
Hardly.
You worked with Gideon.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.807
You tried to destroy
my uncle's mind.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.852
It was just a job, kid.
No hard feelings.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.680
I've been keeping
an eye on you

06:28.889 --> 06:31.483
since then and I must say,
I'm impressed.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.483
Really?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.814
You deserve a prize.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.021
Here, have a head
that's always screaming.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.572
( Screams )

06:41.860 --> 06:42.702
( Bill laughs)

06:42.903 --> 06:44.371
The point is,
I like you.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.494
How's about you let me
give you a hint, huh?

06:46.698 --> 06:50.919
I only ask
for a small favor in return.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.666
I'd never do
a favor for you.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.714
Don't forget who defeated
you last time.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.883
Right,
you defeated me.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.044
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

06:59.252 --> 07:02.222
I'll be here for you
ready to make a deal.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.384
Hey, want to hear my impression
of you in about 3 seconds.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.844
( Screaming )

07:14.559 --> 07:16.527
Hey,
I'm puppet Stan.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.854
Still ignoring this.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.781
Hey, Mabel.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.857
( Yawns )

07:21.066 --> 07:22.909
Whoa, bag check
for Dipper's eyes.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.656
Nobody?

07:24.861 --> 07:27.205
Dipper, I told you to get
some sleep last night.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
Here, wake up
with some Mabel juice.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.168
It has plastic
dinosaurs in it.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.747
It's like if coffee
and nightmares had a baby.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.877
Mabel, listen.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.916
Last night I had
a dream with Bill in it.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.177
Wait, hold up.
The triangle guy?

07:40.377 --> 07:42.254
He said he'd give me
the code of the laptop

07:42.462 --> 07:43.930
if I gave him
something.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.848
Like I'd actually
trust Bill, right?

07:46.049 --> 07:46.766
Don't worry, bro.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.763
Today is the day

07:47.968 --> 07:49.686
that the mystery twins
are back in action.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.933
I'll help you
crack that code.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.605
I just got to hand
off my puppet stuff

07:52.764 --> 07:53.765
to my production crew.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.066
Production crew?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.736
We read the script.
Very emotional.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.860
I cried, like,
eight times.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.065
GABE: Hey, ladies.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.531
Gabe!

08:05.735 --> 08:06.611
I was just blading by.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.868
Helps me dry out my ponytail
after a shower.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.166
Aah. Aah.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.792
Hoppity boppity.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.915
( Speaking
in foreign language )

08:16.162 --> 08:17.459
It's so great
to see you.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.008
I was just working on the
world's greatest puppet show.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.334
It has puppets.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.341
Your passion
is so refreshing, Mabel,

08:23.545 --> 08:25.798
unlike the girl from
last night's puppet show.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.808
Single-stitch on one puppet
and cross-stitch on the other?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.262
I was like, uh-huh.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.721
Cross... huh?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.602
Naturally I deleted her off
my cell phone contacts list.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.933
Naturally.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.940
( Nervous giggle )

08:39.144 --> 08:40.441
I know you won't
let me down though.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.820
Based on what you
said the other day,

08:42.022 --> 08:43.399
you must be
a puppet expert.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.358
You know, Gabe,
you look pretty sweaty.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.072
You should really
take your shirt off.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.153
Right?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.411
Aren't we all
thinking that?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.239
Later, ladies.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.542
Bah!

08:54.743 --> 08:56.791
We got to up
our game, girls.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.669
Did you hear that thing
he said about the stitches?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.717
Don't worry, Mabel,
your crew can handle it.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.043
(grunts)

09:04.252 --> 09:05.094
Oops.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.218
How many eyes does
a face have again?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.551
I got it. I got it. Oh!

09:10.759 --> 09:11.931
(alarm wailing )

09:12.135 --> 09:13.307
I'm not okay.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.310
Ah!
Okay, I'm back on fabrication.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.686
Get me my lint roller.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.733
Whoa, hey.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.934
You just said you
were going to help me.

09:20.143 --> 09:24.023
Dipper, this sock crisis just
bumped up to a code argyle.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.857
The laptop can wait.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.067
Mabel,
do you seriously think

09:27.275 --> 09:28.401
that your random
crush of the week

09:28.610 --> 09:29.736
is more important
than uncovering

09:29.944 --> 09:30.945
the mysteries
of this town?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.155
You're obsessed.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.198
I'm obsessed?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.750
Look at you.
You look like a vampire.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.917
And not the hot kind.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.745
But you said you were
gonna help me today.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.957
Well, I can help
you with tickles.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.625
( laughter )

09:45.835 --> 09:46.757
Okay, fine.
You know what?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.638
I'll do it on my own.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.259
Passwords, passwords.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.346
Mabel is useless.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.429
( Yawns )

09:56.638 --> 09:57.730
Oh, man.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.025
<i>- COMPUTER: Too many failed entries.
- Huh?</i>

10:00.225 --> 10:02.728
<i>Initiate data erase
in 5 minutes.</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:03.732
( beeping )

10:03.937 --> 10:05.063
No.
No, no, no!

10:05.271 --> 10:08.115
I'm gonna lose everything?
I only have one more try?

10:08.316 --> 10:12.241
Well, well, well.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.905
Someone's looking
desperate.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.866
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.075
I can help you, kid.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.869
You just need to hear
out my demands.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.704
Ugh!

10:20.912 --> 10:22.129
What crazy thing do
you want, anyway?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.332
To eat my soul?
To rip out my teeth?

10:24.541 --> 10:27.715
Are you gonna replace my eyes
with baby heads or something?

10:27.919 --> 10:30.798
Yeesh, kid, relax.
All I want is a puppet.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.554
Wh A Puppet?
at are you playing at?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.101
Everyone loves puppets.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.053
And it looks to me like
you've got a surplus.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.014
I don't know, man.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.350
Mabel worked
really hard on these.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.856
Seems to me one little puppet
is a small price to pay

10:44.060 --> 10:46.062
to learn all the secrets
of the universe.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.320
Besides, what's your sister
done for you lately?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.110
How many times have you
sacrificed for her, huh?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.741
And when has she ever
returned the favor?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.582
( Beeping )

10:59.868 --> 11:01.541
Tick tock, kid.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.877
Just one puppet?
Fine.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.340
So what puppet are
you gonna pick anyway?

11:09.544 --> 11:13.424
Hmm, let's see.
Eenie meenie mynee...

11:13.631 --> 11:14.427
You.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.225
What?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.436
What?
This can't be happening.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.230
What did you
do to my body?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.028
Sorry, kid, but
you're my puppet now.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.855
( Evil laughter )

11:30.440 --> 11:32.158
Oh, my gosh.
This can't be happening.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.530
This can't be happening.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.736
Wh-whoa.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.070
( Iaughil19 )

11:37.113 --> 11:40.993
Man, it's been so long
since I've inhabited a body.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.206
Ooh! Ooh!

11:42.410 --> 11:43.286
( Chuckles )

11:43.494 --> 11:45.041
Pain is hilarious.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.755
And two eyes?
This thing's deluxe.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.925
I don't understand.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.086
Why are you doing this?
I thought we had a deal.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.889
Look, kid, you've been getting
way too close to figuring out

11:55.089 --> 11:56.181
some major answers.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.759
I've got big plans coming

11:57.967 --> 11:59.219
and I don't need you
getting in my way.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.100
Destroying that laptop
was a cinch.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.432
Now I just need to
destroy your journal.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.983
Race you to the bottom
of the stairs.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.077
Hey.
Human soda.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.029
I'm gonna drink
it like a person.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.708
So where do you keep
that journal anyway?

12:22.909 --> 12:25.207
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.788
Boy, these arms are durable.

12:26.996 --> 12:27.918
I've hidden it somewhere

12:28.081 --> 12:30.004
you'll never find it
in a million years.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.300
Hey, Dipper.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.593
I borrowed your journal
to use as a prop in the show.

12:32.794 --> 12:33.716
I hope you don't mind.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.842
I'm gonna go before you
process this sentence.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.343
Okay, bye!

12:37.840 --> 12:40.844
Sure, sounds great, sister.
I'll see you at the show.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.474
Wait.
No, Mabel, don't listen to him.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.601
That's not me.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.598
You've got to hear me.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.982
No, no. Wait. Stop!

12:49.060 --> 12:51.062
Ha, welcome
to the mindscape, kid.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.490
Without a vessel to possess,
you're basically a ghost.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.987
Oh, hi, Dipper.
There you are.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.283
What up, dude?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.364
Soos. Wendy.
Help me.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.660
( Echoing )

12:58.861 --> 13:00.238
We're headed to the theater.
Need a ride, Dipper?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.448
( Chuckles )
BILL: Anything for you, Red.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.874
I'm gonna stop you, Bill.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.952
I'm gonna find that
journal before you do

13:06.119 --> 13:07.496
and I'm gonna stop you!

13:07.704 --> 13:12.551
But how can you stop
me if you don't exist?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.297
( Evil laughter )

13:21.009 --> 13:22.477
Bill?
Bill!

13:22.677 --> 13:25.180
Got to get my body back before
he does something crazy with it.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.769
Ah, nothing like
the theater, huh, toots?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.149
Hey, Soos, want to hear

13:32.353 --> 13:33.525
the exact time and date
of your death?

13:33.730 --> 13:34.526
( Chuckles )

13:34.731 --> 13:35.653
Okay.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.325
HEY, GUYS,
you all made it.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.359
Are you kidding me?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.242
I would never miss
whatever this is.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.869
By the by, Mabel, where'd
you put my journal again?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.167
I used it as a prop
for the big wedding scene.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.869
I still need
a reverend though.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.795
Hey, what if I play
the reverend?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.998
I mean, someone's got to
hold that journal, right?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.337
Great. Let's go.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.168
Oh, no, wait.
Mabel!

14:05.011 --> 14:06.604
GRENDA:
The show is about to begin.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.390
Please turn off
your cell phones,

14:08.598 --> 14:10.726
unless
you're texting me, cuties.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.815
Gather around
and let us sing

14:18.024 --> 14:21.870
about a girl who had
almost everything.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.865
Look, it's Mabel.

14:25.073 --> 14:25.949
Hey there.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.158
Did you say stable?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.744
No, he said Mabel.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.749
Okay, hit it, boys!

14:30.953 --> 14:34.423

with the pig and the braces? ♪

14:34.624 --> 14:37.924

Hey, what's up?
I'm Gabe.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.570
So, hey, Grendo,

14:59.774 --> 15:01.822
where's that book prop I'm
using for the wedding scene?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.323
It's up in the wedding cake.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.121
But that doesn't come
down until Act 3.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.952
So hold your horses.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.877
Oh, I'll hold my horses.
I'll hold them.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.249
You monster.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.290
Hey, listen.
Have you seen Mabel?

15:15.498 --> 15:16.920
Hmm.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.084
What did Bill say?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.135
I can't be heard
without a vessel?

15:20.336 --> 15:21.804
Where would I find a...

15:24.882 --> 15:26.350
Finally we're together.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.931
I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have
to go fight in the war.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.641
( Screaming )

15:34.517 --> 15:36.485
( growling )

15:36.644 --> 15:37.861
( gunshots )

15:38.062 --> 15:40.406
I'll wait for you, Gabe.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.823
I'll wait for you.

15:42.024 --> 15:42.866
( Cheers and applause )

15:43.067 --> 15:44.865
GRENDA: Our intermission
has begun.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.036
Mill about.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.409
( Crowd murmurs )

15:47.613 --> 15:50.116
Ooh!
Okay, you can do this, Mabel.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.536
Only 36 more musical numbers.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.419
Psst.
Mabel.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.839
It's come to life.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.754
The puppet books
didn't warn me about this.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.887
Aah!

16:04.088 --> 16:06.762
Mabel, it's me, Dipper.
You need to help me.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.889
Wait, what?
Dipper?

16:09.093 --> 16:12.768
But you're so much more
of a sock than usual.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.690
Mabel, you have to listen.
Bill tricked me.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.019
He stole my body and now
he's after the journal.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.399
You have to find the journal
before Bill destroys it.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.735
It's the only hope
to get me back in my body.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.691
But my cue's
coming up any minute.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.696
( Knocking on door )

16:24.901 --> 16:25.948
Hey, Mabel,
do you have a moment?

16:26.152 --> 16:26.948
Gabe!

16:27.153 --> 16:27.949
( QiQQIes )

16:28.154 --> 16:29.997
Ow!
Mabel.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.792
Mabel, it's clear to me now
that you really love puppets.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.289
I mean you went whole hog.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.167
And if you stick
the ending, well,

16:36.370 --> 16:38.372
maybe later you could
join me for a biscotti?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.423
( Qasps )

16:39.624 --> 16:42.173
You drive a biscotti?

16:42.376 --> 16:43.548
I'll be waiting.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.881
Did you hear that?
He loves it!

16:47.089 --> 16:48.762
This play
has to be flawless.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.718
Can't we wait
until after the show?

16:50.885 --> 16:53.729
Mabel, you want me to be
a sock puppet forever?

16:53.930 --> 16:54.726
( Iaughil19 )

16:54.931 --> 16:55.727
I'm sorry.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.809
It looks funny
when you're mad.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.109
( Grunting )

17:00.478 --> 17:01.650
Okay. Okay. Okay.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.607
Just take over for me until
I get back with the book.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.863
Little puppet face.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.787
Gabe, you're back
from the war.

17:09.987 --> 17:10.863
Yes, I am.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.869
Want to kiss and sing
at the same time?

17:13.074 --> 17:14.326
Okay.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.170
Seriously?

17:27.128 --> 17:29.223
Come on.
Come on.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.266
I hope this kiss never ends.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.518
( Exhaling )

17:36.681 --> 17:37.682
Come on, come on.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.767
There must be a way to
get Dipper's body back.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.570
Oh-oh, but why would
you want to do that?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.194
( Gaps )

17:45.398 --> 17:47.696
Bill-Dipper!
Bipper.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.776
Shh.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.987
You wouldn't
want to ruin the show.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.196
Whoops.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.205
( Screaming )

17:53.406 --> 17:54.407
It's slipping-

17:54.615 --> 17:56.083
How's about you
hand that book over?

17:56.242 --> 17:57.619
No way.
This is Dipper's.

17:57.827 --> 17:58.669
I'd never give it away.

17:58.869 --> 17:59.711
Hmm.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.004
You didn't seem
to have a problem

18:01.163 --> 18:02.460
taking it for your own play.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.962
Or ditching him
when he needed you.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.884
So come to your senses.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.716
Give me the book
or your play is ruined.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.505
( Sighs )

18:09.714 --> 18:11.182
There it is.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.884
I mean, who would
sacrifice everything

18:13.092 --> 18:15.060
they've worked for just
for their dumb sibling?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.355
Dipper would.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.351
Eh?

18:18.556 --> 18:19.648
H oh!
ey! Hey! Hey!

18:19.849 --> 18:20.941
I'm giving you away.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.860
You are a woman now.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.062
Waddles, the rings.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.238
Wait, what?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.574
Oh, no.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.326
[[511

18:31.527 --> 18:34.201
Get out of my brother's body,
you evil triangle!

18:34.363 --> 18:36.161
Whoa!
Children fighting.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.617
I can sell this.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.920
Aah!
You can't stop me.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.919
I am a being of pure energy
with no weakness.

18:44.081 --> 18:44.957
(grunts)

18:45.124 --> 18:47.752
True, but you're
in Dipper's body.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.091
And I know
all his weaknesses.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.297
What do you mean
"his--?"

18:51.505 --> 18:52.301
Tickle, tickle.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.258
( Iaughil19 )

18:54.467 --> 18:56.390
Aah!
Body spasms.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.595
What are these?

18:57.762 --> 18:59.184
A little note
about the human body.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.811
You haven't slept
in over 24 hours.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.268
Also,
I got a full night's sleep

19:03.476 --> 19:05.478
and I'm on four
mega shots of Mabel juice.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.521
( Panting )

19:06.729 --> 19:08.276
What is this feeling?

19:08.439 --> 19:10.612
My body is burning.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.035
I can't move
these stupid noodle legs.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.363
Curse you,
useless flesh sticks.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.790
Body shutting down,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.742
must scratch,

19:19.950 --> 19:21.372
mosquito bites.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.918
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

19:32.004 --> 19:32.926
What?

19:33.130 --> 19:33.926
Yes!

19:34.131 --> 19:35.474
I'm in my own body

19:35.675 --> 19:39.054
and it's just as
underwhelming as I remember.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.137
(groans)

19:40.346 --> 19:41.188
Everything hurts.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.766
( Evil laughter )

19:45.101 --> 19:47.775
This isn't the last
you'll hear of me.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.195
Big things are coming.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.740
You can't stop me.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.362
I'm sorry, Gabe.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.295
( Opera music playing )

20:22.096 --> 20:23.439
Don't worry.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.812
I've seen enough movies
to know this is the part

20:26.016 --> 20:26.767
where the audience thinks

20:26.976 --> 20:29.525
it was all part of the show
and loves it.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.356
Cue applause!

20:31.522 --> 20:33.570
( Crowd booing )

20:39.697 --> 20:40.539
Gabe!

20:40.740 --> 20:42.458
Stick around
for the wrap party?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.456
We got mini quiches.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.378
Don't speak to me, Mabel.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.752
You've made a mockery
of my art form.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.048
Let's go, my loves.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.627
( Kissing )

20:52.835 --> 20:54.929
Did he just make out
with his puppets?

20:55.129 --> 20:57.552
I might have dodged
a bullet there.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.758
( Speaking in
foreign language )

21:00.509 --> 21:01.431
Oof!

21:01.635 --> 21:03.433
Mabel,
I'm sorry about all this.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.355
It's my fault
your puppets got ruined.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.058
Well,
one of them survived.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.018
And she has something
to say to you.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.149
I'm sorry, Dipper.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.607
I spent all week
obsessing over a dumb guy.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.285
But the dumb guy I should
have cared about was you.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.286
Bah!

21:19.445 --> 21:21.072
Mystery twins.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.623
Mystery twins.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.040
Ow!

21:24.200 --> 21:25.873
What did
Bill do to my hand?

21:26.076 --> 21:26.918
Aah!

21:27.119 --> 21:28.712
Nothing
a little sleep can't fix.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.837
Come on, bro bro,
let's go home.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.626
Seriously, I need to
go to the hospital.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.211
Hey, Dipper.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.719
What did one sock puppet say
to the other sock puppet?

21:38.881 --> 21:39.757
I don't know, Mabel.

21:39.924 --> 21:40.800
What?

21:41.008 --> 21:43.636
You look like
you could use a hand.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.929
( Iaughil19 )

21:47.306 --> 21:49.684
That joke
was really something.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.940
Yeah, something terrible.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.521
( Iaughil19 )

21:54.855 --> 21:55.947
( screaming )
