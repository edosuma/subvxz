WEBVTT

00:11.770 --> 00:14.990
- watch the road
- lisa, shut it

00:15.350 --> 00:17.350
- Yeah.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.730
If our folks knew we skipped
the retreat. we are so toast.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.510
Not if we change
and get our stories straight.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.010
- Would you grab the wheel?
- Yeah.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.360
- What?
- Well,that certainly screams church retreat.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.390
"Actually,Mommy,
somebody did have beer.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.900
I had a sip. It was disgusting. "

00:37.800 --> 00:40.280
"And we'll never ever drink again. "

01:11.460 --> 01:12.890
Have you found Lisa?

01:13.100 --> 01:14.360
We're still looking.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.230
She just went flying.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.220
She's dead,isn't she?

01:18.380 --> 01:19.890
We don't know that yet.

01:20.970 --> 01:22.180
Tell me what happened.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.920
It was my fault.

01:26.740 --> 01:29.060
It was totally my fault.
I was changing in the car and,

01:29.330 --> 01:31.180
and there was just this bang,
and we went off the road.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.930
- Lieutenant Caine?
- Yeah.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.110
- We've got something you need to see.
- Okay.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.450
I'll be right back,okay?

01:51.660 --> 01:53.090
You two are lucky to be alive.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.800
Wish I could say the same
about your other friend.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.750
Oh,my God!I don't know her.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.260
There're only two of us.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.229
I was hoping my services
wouldn't be needed today.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.130
Well,whoever she is,

02:18.240 --> 02:22.370
I can tell by the skin sloughing
that she's been underwater at least a day.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.440
She drown?

02:23.630 --> 02:25.060
Appears she was stabbed.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.370
A big knife,judging from the wounds.

02:28.170 --> 02:30.080
A murder like this is personal.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.650
No I.D.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.130
We'll drag the river. See what we find.

02:35.190 --> 02:38.350
Alexx,would you please roll up her sleeve?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.980
- Excuse me?
- Just please do it.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.500
A birthmark?

02:52.590 --> 02:54.330
Her name is Rachel Turner.

02:54.930 --> 02:56.390
Horatio,you know this woman?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.320
I was with her two nights ago.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.120
And if she's been underwater for a full day...

03:01.190 --> 03:02.710
You were the last one to see her alive?

03:02.770 --> 03:06.590
That's correct. And Frank,you'd
better move quickly because right now

03:06.760 --> 03:08.090
I'm your only suspect.

03:32.600 --> 03:40.400
CSI:miami
Season 04 Episode 06

04:04.590 --> 04:06.380
I don't know,Horatio,
this doesn't seem right.

04:06.430 --> 04:09.660
I understand,Frank. Let's stay
with the procedure-question me.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.950
All right. What was your
relationship with the victim?

04:13.010 --> 04:16.829
Rachel is an attorney,Frank,
that I met recently at a pretrial hearing.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.360
- Any bad blood between you two?
- No.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.899
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.410
- You ever been to her place?
- Two nights ago she made me dinner.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.320
- Anyone you know that Nwould want to hurt her?
- No.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.440
Okay,uh...

04:32.550 --> 04:34.650
- were you last night?
- I was with you.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.660
All right,I can't
think of anything else.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.460
It rained last night.
We're not gonna find the killer's tracks.

04:42.495 --> 04:43.750
Frank...

04:44.370 --> 04:45.650
take these.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.120
You're gonna need them.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.990
I'm not the guy that takes
care of that sort of thing.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.340
As of right now,
I'm a private citizen.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.460
You sure?

04:57.490 --> 04:59.220
I am. Can I go?

05:00.970 --> 05:02.810
Of course you can go.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.730
You sure you want to see this,Horatio?

05:20.430 --> 05:22.260
I have to.

05:23.930 --> 05:25.900
Cared about her,didn't you?

05:29.550 --> 05:30.840
Cheers.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.790
She was a great lady.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.170
Cause of death is exsanguination.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.320
First wound is defensive,

05:54.690 --> 05:57.270
but the rest all penetrated the torso.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.670
She lost a lot of blood,Horatio.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.590
Means she was alive long
enough to know she was dying.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.020
Alexx...

06:07.890 --> 06:10.970
...take care of her,okay?

06:27.610 --> 06:30.100
So Horatio really cared about this woman.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.250
Would be the first one since Yelina.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.960
Well,there's no sign of a forced entry.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.270
The security alarm is deactivated,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.750
but there are definitely
indications of a struggle.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.200
Table's in disarray,wine's been spilled.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.950
I don't see a second wine glass.
Let's look for it.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.020
This isn't just red wine.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.580
Rachel Turner's blood?

07:03.940 --> 07:05.340
Or it could be the killer's.

07:05.450 --> 07:08.910
A lot of times in a stabbing,the
killer will cut themselves in the process.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.060
Kind of dark,isn't it?

07:13.270 --> 07:14.580
The AC's off.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.290
It's at least 90 degrees in here.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.930
Right. Blood darkens the hotter it is.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.760
Yeah.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.600
You know,this just doesn't make any sense.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.100
If Rachel was killed here,
there should be a lot more blood.

07:26.170 --> 07:29.210
Well,either the killer...

07:30.760 --> 07:32.770
is an expert at crime-scene clean up,

07:34.050 --> 07:36.130
or she was murdered somewhere else.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.530
You rang?

07:56.950 --> 07:57.950
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.060
Seemed too convenient,

07:59.120 --> 08:02.830
the girls went off the road at exactly
the spot where Rachel Turner was found.

08:03.340 --> 08:04.990
The accident was no accident.

08:05.780 --> 08:08.910
These punctures are in a pattern.
Someone used a spike strip.

08:15.510 --> 08:17.360
Who's out to get you,H?

08:17.790 --> 08:20.980
A very old friend,Eric.

08:21.510 --> 08:23.610
I'm gonna grab Ryan,we're
gonna go back to the scene.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.960
- See where that strip was.
- Okay.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.470
Yeah. Well,sure,

08:29.520 --> 08:31.820
Delko,I'll be right down there.
I'm just gonna pop into DNA.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.030
Okay.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.720
I got your message. Results on the
sample from Rachel Turner's apartment?

08:38.140 --> 08:39.799
Blood's not hers.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.630
However,we do know
the person it belongs to.

08:49.580 --> 08:50.740
Damn.

08:50.820 --> 08:54.100
It's Horatio's blood.
Maybe he cut himself opening the wine.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.740
Maybe,but there is a lot
of blood there for a little cut.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.030
Hi,Calleigh. Yeah,I got bad
news about the blood sample.

09:00.420 --> 09:01.830
I'll tell Tripp.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.730
Hello,Horatio.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.740
Sorry I was late.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.540
What've you got?

09:12.610 --> 09:14.140
They,uh...

09:15.850 --> 09:18.180
they found your blood in Rachel
Turner's apartment,Horatio.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.580
And right now I can't explain it.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.210
No idea?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.720
No.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.820
What about Yelina? She disappeared.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.990
Frank,wh...
wh-what are you asking me?

09:42.070 --> 09:43.650
I just,uh...

09:44.540 --> 09:46.290
I just want to know where she is.

09:48.390 --> 09:50.180
Frank,she is...

09:52.770 --> 09:54.620
She's safe from harm.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.120
I want to believe you,Horatio.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.030
All right.

10:06.510 --> 10:08.350
If it helps,uh,

10:08.420 --> 10:11.210
you can check with the police union.
She just filed papers.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.620
- Yelina retired?
- Yeah.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.550
Where did she go?

10:18.010 --> 10:19.330
Frank,

10:19.750 --> 10:22.660
she's with her family and she's happy.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.740
- Look,Horatio...
- Frank...

10:29.210 --> 10:30.920
It's okay.

10:48.370 --> 10:50.810
Spike strip was gone
when emergency showed up,

10:50.920 --> 10:52.960
which means someone
came back to get it.

10:54.430 --> 10:56.520
Uh,you know,this may not be
the best time for this,

10:56.580 --> 10:57.930
but,uh...

10:58.040 --> 10:59.700
you know that check you wrote me?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.660
Yeah,for the children's shelter,sure.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.710
You know I was going to
deposit it in my account...

11:03.750 --> 11:05.850
...and I was gonna write one
big check from all of us to them?

11:05.900 --> 11:07.070
Yeah.

11:07.390 --> 11:08.690
It bounced.

11:08.770 --> 11:12.440
Horatio's a suspect in a murder investigation
and you're hawking me about a check?

11:12.640 --> 11:15.060
My credit's on the line.
I got old student loans. I just...

11:15.110 --> 11:16.890
- I can't be overdrawn.
- Okay,look,

11:17.160 --> 11:19.260
last month,I forgot to carry the one.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.925
- I'll take care of it,okay?
- Okay.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.330
- You mind if we get back to the investigation?
- I never wasn't in it.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.590
Okay,good.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.320
Hold on. Hold on.

11:27.490 --> 11:30.020
Look,this is where the girl's skid began,

11:30.080 --> 11:32.750
which means that the spike strip
had to be placed right about here.

11:34.510 --> 11:36.310
There's tire marks on the curb.

11:36.370 --> 11:38.900
Yeah,wider than a Mustang would be.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.590
So somebody pulled up after the accident.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.620
Judging from the wheel base,
it's a pretty big vehicle.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.050
Hey,I got something.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.440
It's jet black.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.830
It's not from this section of the causeway.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.670
The wheelbase is 122.6 inches.

12:29.810 --> 12:31.730
What vehicle is that size?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.150
For starters,our department Hummers.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.680
Oh,boy.

13:06.420 --> 13:07.680
How'd it go out there?

13:07.710 --> 13:09.440
Things aren't really looking good for the boss.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.110
If Horatio doesn't start
putting things into context,

13:12.750 --> 13:14.380
he could be in big trouble.

13:14.570 --> 13:16.330
Well,that's why we're here.

13:19.490 --> 13:20.960
You working Horatio's blood sample?

13:21.380 --> 13:22.410
Yeah.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.070
Let's see what's in it.

13:26.510 --> 13:27.660
That's interesting.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.820
High levels of EDTA.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.860
It's an anticoagulant,isn't it?

13:33.970 --> 13:35.680
It's used when people draw your blood.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.300
Or when they store it for a long time.

14:02.870 --> 14:05.130
Ten years in Miami,
you were never injured.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.600
But you were in New York,weren't you?

14:15.150 --> 14:17.340
Ten years ago,in New York City,

14:17.380 --> 14:21.170
I was stabbed badly during
my last investigation.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.360
Someone's been saving
your blood for ten years.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.940
They're trying to frame you.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.580
That is the Wilson family.

14:31.650 --> 14:35.800
Somebody left this file
in our lab about a week ago.

14:36.520 --> 14:40.120
Now,I thought it was Stetler
just digging into the past,

14:40.750 --> 14:43.030
but now I know that's not the truth.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.800
Which is?

14:45.080 --> 14:47.920
Have you heard the name Walter Dresden?

14:50.210 --> 14:51.520
Dresden.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.190
He was the guy who locked the children
in the closet while he tortured the parents.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.730
I almost captured him in New York City.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.360
He's back.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.340
Why?

15:02.360 --> 15:06.100
Ego,Calleigh.
I embarrassed him and now he wants revenge.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.240
What do you want to do?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.880
What would we normally do?

15:10.650 --> 15:13.550
Follow the evidence,eliminate
suspects and catch a killer.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.170
Are you in danger?

15:16.910 --> 15:19.660
Not if we play it clean.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.620
Hey,Eric.

15:31.150 --> 15:32.630
Got those results for you.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.520
- On the gravel from the causeway?
- Yeah.

15:34.570 --> 15:36.500
I eliminated all immediate
environmental concerns-

15:36.530 --> 15:38.130
dirt from the road,
rubber from the tires.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.210
Good. What'd you get?

15:39.260 --> 15:41.140
Well,the gravel's pretty standard stuff,
but...

15:41.190 --> 15:42.640
take a look at what it's coated with.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.090
A styrene-butadiene anionic polymer.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.700
Used to minimize oxidation
and create a stronger surface.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.230
For airplanes to land on.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.460
You're looking at tarmac,

15:50.500 --> 15:53.240
but I'm guessing that there wasn't a plane
near the site of your vehicular accident.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.440
I'm looking for a vehicle that
drives out to meet one.

15:55.490 --> 15:56.870
- Thanks,Vince.
- Sure.

16:00.370 --> 16:03.510
You guys are the only outfit near the
airport that rent these kinds of cars,right?

16:03.620 --> 16:06.450
The best way to blend in to
Miami is to appear rich,right?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.660
Everybody wants a Hummer.
We're the only ones who've got 'em.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.860
You rent one in the last couple of days?

16:10.940 --> 16:13.060
Yeah,customer came in,
paid cash up front,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.000
double the price for his privacy.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.680
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.990
Drove out to the tarmac to get him.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.040
Never saw him get in.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.680
- Vehicle's due back tomorrow.
- I need it today.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.320
- You equip these things with GPS?
- Of course.

16:29.090 --> 16:31.630
- Oh,you want me to look it up now?
- Just a thought.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.630
Hummer's in the Gables.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.910
H. Got a location.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.540
- Where?
- In the Gables.

16:54.610 --> 16:55.720
You want me to send a unit over?

16:55.790 --> 16:57.900
No,no. He won't go back.
He's too smart for that.

16:57.980 --> 16:58.980
Where'd he ditch it?

16:59.010 --> 17:00.800
- Riviera and Castania.
- Where'd you say?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.410
- Riviera and Castania.
- Eric,um...

17:03.830 --> 17:05.349
I got to go.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.920
Horatio,is he coming after me?

17:18.410 --> 17:21.760
Well,sweetheart,there's no way to know,
but I want to get you out of here anyway.

17:21.810 --> 17:23.670
I'm not gonna hide
for the rest of my life.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.829
And I don't want you to,
but I want to get you to a safe place.

17:26.910 --> 17:29.370
So you're putting me back in a closet.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.310
It's for your own good.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.970
That's exactly what he said.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.570
I can still hear my parents screaming.

18:01.370 --> 18:03.400
When I wanted out,I couldn't.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.440
But I opened the door for you,didn't I?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.880
You shielded me from their bodies.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.310
Hi.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.420
Is it safe?

18:39.150 --> 18:40.640
It is now.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.590
Come on,Jennifer.
Come with me.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.230
You can trust me.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.250
Attagirl.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.080
I did trust you.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.040
Jennifer,

19:03.320 --> 19:05.120
I want you to trust me now.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.310
How long do I have to disappear?

19:10.510 --> 19:12.210
Just until you're safe.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.200
All right?

19:15.140 --> 19:16.490
Come on.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.460
There you go.

19:23.430 --> 19:27.660
Now,sweetheart,I'll call you later.
You're going to be fine. All right?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.190
Full process,please.

19:44.260 --> 19:47.470
This is the New York file about
the Wilson murder that Horatio gave me.

19:47.590 --> 19:48.740
You want to wait?

19:49.320 --> 19:50.400
Yup.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.850
Trace appears to have pretty much degraded.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.670
That doesn't make any sense.
It's like it's too clean.

20:32.350 --> 20:36.450
There was one thing that was out of the
ordinary,though. We have traces of UW solution.

20:36.590 --> 20:39.080
- That's embalming fluid.
- Yeah.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.190
What is that,some kind of message?

20:41.250 --> 20:43.510
- No,I think it's an oversight.
- Where you going?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.280
To talk to a professional.

20:45.530 --> 20:46.820
Thank you.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.580
And the scientific name is Berlzer UW.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.540
It's used for organ storage during autopsies.

20:54.590 --> 20:57.680
- When was the last time you used it?
- I use it all the time.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.000
Why is this relevant?

20:59.050 --> 21:01.750
Because I'm thinking that someone
in here may have touched this file.

21:01.810 --> 21:03.890
I've never seen this before.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.530
Maybe there was a mistake.

21:06.230 --> 21:08.270
Now,baby,I don't make mistakes.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.860
I know that you don't. I'm just thinking
that you might know who could have.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.340
Either of you guys seen
this case file before?

21:17.390 --> 21:19.180
That's the one I left for Ms. Boa Vista.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.960
- When did you do that?
- Last week.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.020
Some detective stopped me,
asked me to drop it off for him.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.810
Do you remember which detective?

21:25.890 --> 21:27.220
Never seen him before.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.680
I'm pretty sure his I.D. said Phillips.

21:29.970 --> 21:32.140
- Matt Phillips.
- Thanks.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.640
Hey,Tripp,I need you to have a
conversation with one of your guys,okay?

21:38.410 --> 21:39.540
Detective Phillips?

21:40.150 --> 21:42.400
- Hey,Frank,how you doing?
- I'm all right.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.370
You mind if I take a look
at your badge and I.D.?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.510
Now is not the time to lie to me.

21:51.670 --> 21:54.240
See,my D.B. car got broken into,

21:54.310 --> 21:57.330
and whoever it was
has my badge and my I.D.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.840
At your mistress's place?

21:58.890 --> 22:00.430
- And you didn't report it?
- Come on,Frank,

22:00.470 --> 22:02.590
you know how it is here.
I didn't want it to be on my sheet.

22:02.630 --> 22:05.300
Well,by not reporting it,
you may have helped a killer.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.560
I messed up,okay? But,look,

22:08.690 --> 22:11.520
I'm working on wife number two here,
we've got kids together.

22:11.550 --> 22:14.610
I'm not interested in hurting
your home life,all right?

22:15.640 --> 22:17.360
But I'm going to impound your car.

22:39.970 --> 22:41.540
Hey. Check that out.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.800
It's not trilobal.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.650
Which means it's not from an automobile.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.185
Means this fiber is out of place.

22:55.220 --> 22:58.080
Yeah,all right. Well,let's run it
through themicrospectrophotometer

22:58.130 --> 22:59.580
and break it down completely.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.690
Every color leaves a fingerprint.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.500
Even if our killer didn't.

23:15.770 --> 23:16.840
Find anything yet?

23:16.900 --> 23:19.100
Yeah,this is interesting-
our red fiber isn't even red.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.170
It's actually a combination
of three different colors.

23:21.210 --> 23:25.010
Its dominate feature is red,
but it's accented by blue and cyan.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.860
What about compound?

23:26.960 --> 23:31.730
It is a synthetic blend of nylon,
polyester,and dichloromethane.

23:33.490 --> 23:36.020
Okay,let's run it through
our manufacturer's database.

23:36.060 --> 23:38.560
I want to find out
where this carpet came from.

23:45.430 --> 23:46.770
I was looking for you.

23:46.910 --> 23:51.080
The fiber from Detective Phillip's car
was manufactured by Hamstead Textiles.

23:51.110 --> 23:52.930
It's a small company out of Buffalo.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.980
It went out of business a couple
of months ago,but before it did,

23:56.040 --> 23:59.550
it sold 100,000 yards
of "Midnight Rose #11"

23:59.600 --> 24:02.520
to Spirex Builders,
a company based in Tampa.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.500
Yes,but they do

24:04.520 --> 24:07.930
have a condo project right here,
as we speak,don't they?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.100
Six blocks away.

24:09.170 --> 24:11.090
Six blocks away. Thank you.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.080
- Is that you,Walter?
- Horatio Caine.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.100
What was it that led you to me?

24:54.180 --> 24:56.590
Fiber? Prints?

24:56.730 --> 24:59.500
Or was it that famous Caine instinct?

24:59.510 --> 25:01.430
Something like that,Walter.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.440
You okay,Walter?
That looked like it hurt.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.190
I should kill you right now.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.610
That wouldn't be good
for you,would it?

25:10.650 --> 25:12.760
No,Horatio,it wouldn't.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.570
What happens now?

25:15.230 --> 25:16.770
You...

25:17.370 --> 25:19.840
are going to wait for the cops.

25:30.230 --> 25:32.930
Miami-Dade Police Department!
Stay right where you are!

25:33.150 --> 25:34.070
Right there!

25:34.110 --> 25:35.540
It's me,Frank.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.840
- Horatio?
- Frank.

25:43.050 --> 25:45.330
That's Rachel's blood.

25:56.450 --> 25:58.380
Tell me again what happened here.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.820
I came here to confront Rachel's killer.

26:05.180 --> 26:06.660
You know,I don't think so.

26:06.850 --> 26:10.000
How about you never thought
we'd find Rachel's body.

26:10.330 --> 26:12.510
You came here to clean up the scene.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.260
But you say Dresden was here,
and he just...

26:15.830 --> 26:17.550
flew out the window.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.590
That's exactly what happened,Rick.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.010
H.,what's going on?

26:23.270 --> 26:25.450
Look around,process my crime scene.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.860
What do you want me to do,H.?

26:27.900 --> 26:29.920
You heard the man,Eric,process the scene.

26:29.950 --> 26:32.640
Well,there's no carpet,
which means there's no fibers...

26:32.720 --> 26:34.950
- so Dresden's planted evidence.
- That's enough.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.830
You,Lieutenant? You're under arrest.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.170
After you.

26:55.930 --> 26:57.940
Not used to dealing
with someone this smart.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.870
Well,he did lead us to
the crime scene,didn't he?

27:03.980 --> 27:06.830
So let's find out what
he left for us this time.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.220
Okay.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.140
Dresden escaped before the cops got here,

27:11.190 --> 27:12.980
so that means...

27:15.720 --> 27:17.650
he must have gone out
through one of these window.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.420
Unbelievable.

27:21.510 --> 27:24.600
Dresden lowered himself down
through one of the trash chutes,

27:25.410 --> 27:27.150
and then he pulled it off the building.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.540
Found the murder weapon.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.130
It's got a bloody print on it.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.140
Think our killer was that stupid?

27:55.670 --> 27:57.000
No.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.770
I think he was that smart.

28:01.970 --> 28:03.940
Blood sets prints.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.900
I can't believe Stetler
put you in a holding cell.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.810
It's what he does,Calleigh.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.130
Dresden seems to be one step
ahead of us at every turn.

28:29.090 --> 28:30.950
And you know that
if the news gets a hold of this,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.830
it'll look like there's blood on
your hands,and we know that's not true.

28:33.860 --> 28:36.010
But there is blood on my hands.

28:42.860 --> 28:45.090
That's why you asked me to bring the kit.

29:46.090 --> 29:47.390
Now...

29:47.930 --> 29:49.760
Now we make our move.

29:53.180 --> 29:53.840
Okay,

29:53.850 --> 29:56.470
this is the section that was
attached to the windowsill. Now,

29:57.040 --> 29:58.090
what are we looking for?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.300
Dresden had to press his hands and
feet to the side to keep from falling.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.650
- Haste makes trace.
- That's right.

30:17.620 --> 30:18.820
Hey.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.040
What do you have?

30:20.090 --> 30:22.790
Electronic device.
It's a piece of a processor,maybe.

30:22.870 --> 30:23.910
So?

30:23.950 --> 30:25.240
Those get put in buildings.

30:25.300 --> 30:29.080
Intercoms,entertainment systems,
wireless Internet,security systems.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.385
Yeah...

30:30.420 --> 30:32.040
but not at this stage of construction.

30:32.510 --> 30:34.710
Oh,so Dresden must have had it on him.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.280
Question is,is this part of his crime...

30:38.270 --> 30:40.230
or is it part of his daily life?

30:49.360 --> 30:50.670
What's up,Johnny.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.520
27 grams,right?

30:52.560 --> 30:53.790
Yeah,that should do it.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.700
That's one gram below a felony.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.100
Did I ask for your opinion?

31:09.690 --> 31:10.960
Yeah,it's Delko.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.320
You can't read my writing?

31:13.640 --> 31:16.450
I just need you to take the fingerprint,okay,

31:16.490 --> 31:20.010
and look for any trace you can find
on its surface-other than blood.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.150
That's right.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.840
Thanks.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.760
How much?

31:26.940 --> 31:28.540
That'll be three bills,Big Time.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.140
Here you go. That should do it.

31:46.130 --> 31:49.010
Did you get the result from
the blood on Horatio's hands?

31:49.250 --> 31:51.140
Valera's still processing it.

31:51.190 --> 31:53.250
When she's finished,
I'd like you to run it.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.700
You know,technically,
it isn't an unsolved.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.230
I know that,but a guy like Dresden doesn't
stay idle for ten years waiting for revenge.

32:04.370 --> 32:05.620
You think he's been active?

32:05.660 --> 32:08.840
Not necessarily in Miami,
but will you check the NCIC,

32:08.870 --> 32:11.170
see if there's similar MOs
in other counties?

32:11.220 --> 32:12.880
As a favor.

32:14.220 --> 32:17.390
If the Feds find out that I'm
working on a current case...

32:17.470 --> 32:19.330
My lips are sealed.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.000
Thank you.

32:34.230 --> 32:36.320
- Where you been?
- Had something to do.

32:36.340 --> 32:37.840
I thought you wanted to help Horatio.

32:37.870 --> 32:39.180
Who said I didn't?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.680
You know,we could have run
the bloody print on that knife by now.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.800
Yeah,which would have been
a tremendous mistake,okay?

32:43.820 --> 32:46.570
I already had Trace run some of
the surface of the print for me.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.980
Glycerin.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.590
- That's not something the body secretes.
- No,

32:53.880 --> 32:56.840
but it does help optimize
the workability of a forged print.

32:57.420 --> 33:00.810
The wine glass-Dresden took the one
with Horatio's print on it.

33:02.950 --> 33:04.430
To you.

33:10.130 --> 33:13.980
Dresden lifted it after he
resolved it with cyanoacrylate.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.780
Helps to raise the print
off its original surface.

33:23.910 --> 33:26.790
Then he transfers the
print to a piece of foil.

33:28.210 --> 33:29.790
Okay,but how'd it end up on the knife?

33:29.810 --> 33:32.090
Print was applied to the knife
over a piece of the foil...

33:32.100 --> 33:34.080
...that was dipped into
Rachel Turner's blood.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.810
This Dresden guy is good.
He's sick,but he's good.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.600
He's not that good.

33:54.620 --> 33:57.620
It's time to let Stetler know to
release Horatio from the holding cell.

34:16.630 --> 34:19.440
Might have a break.
The print from the knife is a forgery.

34:19.469 --> 34:21.790
And the blood that Calleigh
swabbed from your hands,

34:21.810 --> 34:24.830
results came back.
It's not yours or Rachel's.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.469
It's definitely male,though.
And once we get...

34:28.489 --> 34:31.050
...a warrant for Dresden's blood,
we can run it against his.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.580
Good work,Eric.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.210
In the meantime,this proves
that your story holds up.

34:35.469 --> 34:37.620
It was a third party in that penthouse.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.699
Tripp

34:42.870 --> 34:44.850
wanted to make sure you got this back.

34:53.510 --> 34:54.940
Thank you,Eric.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.190
Let's go.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.990
Dresden's still out there.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.620
Look at me,you're dead.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.030
Walter Dresden,right?

35:35.260 --> 35:37.680
Horatio told you about me.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.000
I know everything.

35:39.030 --> 35:41.140
Don't lie to me.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.110
He show you the file?

35:43.120 --> 35:47.000
I've seen crime scene
photographs of your last murder.

35:47.150 --> 35:50.080
Well,not exactly my last.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.950
What else was in there?

35:52.250 --> 35:53.810
What should I have seen?

35:53.880 --> 35:55.490
I don't know-

35:55.840 --> 35:57.340
the truth,maybe.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.510
Ask Caine about Jennifer Wilson's mother.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.730
Don't move!

36:13.630 --> 36:17.010
He said,"Ask Caine about
Jennifer Wilson's mother. "

36:19.680 --> 36:21.860
I need you to tell me the truth,Horatio.

36:26.830 --> 36:29.690
My partner and I were
investigating his murders.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.660
He preyed on happily married couples,

36:32.870 --> 36:35.960
but there was one couple
who was not so happy.

36:38.670 --> 36:40.140
Judy Wilson.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.210
Was that Jennifer Wilson's mother?

36:43.260 --> 36:45.700
My partner was having an affair with her.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.110
And she ended up dead.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.580
That's why you still take
care of Jennifer Wilson.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.320
That is a big part of it.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.590
And you were never able to catch him?

37:06.820 --> 37:08.200
Miss Boa Vista.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.000
What do we have?

37:10.030 --> 37:11.510
Calleigh had me cross-check the DNA

37:11.520 --> 37:14.550
from the Dresden sample against
similar crimes across Florida.

37:15.070 --> 37:16.600
I found this- Orlando,

37:16.640 --> 37:18.480
double homicide,young couple,

37:18.530 --> 37:21.060
and the DNA is a match to our unknown sample.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.140
- Was the child locked in a closet?
- Seven-year-old boy.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.520
Consistent with Dresden's MO.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.920
I don't see any breaking and entering here,
do I? Just like Rachel's apartment.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.410
This console.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.450
Apias Systems- maybe he hard wires
smart homes,that's his cover.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.030
That would explain the
circuitry that Ryan found.

37:57.220 --> 37:58.770
I thought you were gone.

38:05.290 --> 38:08.930
Mr. Wolfe,Apias Systems,find out
who's in the field please. Thank you.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.660
Okay,Mr. Wolfe,here's the plan-

38:19.700 --> 38:22.630
I will take the two-three corner,
you flank me.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.570
Go.

39:17.560 --> 39:18.630
Dresden.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.690
We meet again,Walter.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.640
- Cuff him.
- Gladly.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.070
Move and I'll blow your brains out.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.960
I always thought we brought out
the best in each other,Horatio.

39:41.010 --> 39:43.020
Till you killed the Wilsons.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.490
Not me.

39:44.530 --> 39:47.690
But smart killer,whoever it was.

39:47.740 --> 39:49.900
Got you out of New York.

39:50.770 --> 39:52.380
What the hell is he talking about?

39:52.970 --> 39:54.760
Why don't you tell him,Walter?

39:56.380 --> 40:00.880
That Wilson killing was somebody
in their own backyard.

40:02.620 --> 40:05.120
Horatio's partner's mistress.

40:05.790 --> 40:08.730
His partner wasn't about
to explain it to his wife,

40:09.140 --> 40:12.210
and Horatio wasn't about to rat him out.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.730
- Is that true,Horatio?
- Every word,Frank.

40:15.770 --> 40:17.420
Every word.

40:17.550 --> 40:21.620
The only way to avoid giving
a statement was to quit.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.820
The only noble thing you could do.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.230
Can I go now?

40:33.590 --> 40:35.100
Actually,Walter,

40:35.690 --> 40:37.240
you're not going anywhere.

40:37.660 --> 40:39.360
I have you for murder.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.150
You have nothing that ties me to Rachel Turner.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.650
I don't need it.

40:43.700 --> 40:47.010
The day I visited you at
the condo and opened your cheek,

40:47.090 --> 40:49.670
I left there with
a blood sample from you.

40:53.460 --> 40:58.240
As it turns out,that sample is a
perfect match to the killing in Orlando.

41:01.420 --> 41:02.850
So Walter,

41:03.450 --> 41:04.970
I have you.

41:05.410 --> 41:06.920
And you know what else?

41:07.070 --> 41:11.050
You should have never left New York.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.940
Officer.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.330
Gentlemen.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.750
Are you threatening me?

41:27.080 --> 41:30.280
Oh,your solid record's
about to drop markedly.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.560
I won't forget you,Lieutenant.

41:39.930 --> 41:43.110
I've reviewed your evidence
against Walter Dresden,

41:43.150 --> 41:46.140
and,quiet frankly,I'm concerned.

41:46.940 --> 41:49.850
Lieutenant Caine,you should
have recused yourself.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.610
I have done so completely,Your Honor.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.790
The facts are that Dresden killed a woman
that was close to Lieutenant Caine.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.220
Took her out of her apartment...

42:07.020 --> 42:10.000
...and lured the lieutenant to the
place where Dresden killed her.

42:15.070 --> 42:18.370
Your team should not have been
working a case where you were a suspect.

42:18.410 --> 42:21.300
I was not a suspect in
the Orlando case,Your Honor.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.310
Oh,you mean where they found the blood.

42:23.430 --> 42:27.650
Well,Mr. Dresden says that he cut himself
while installing a smart home system.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.240
It's hardly a smoking gun,Lieutenant.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.100
They have an airtight
case on him in Orlando.

42:33.110 --> 42:34.750
Good,good.

42:34.770 --> 42:37.350
An Orlando judge can hear that evidence.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.360
But in this case,

42:39.770 --> 42:41.720
Dresden's released.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.620
Your Honor... Your Honor.

42:48.470 --> 42:51.150
I'd be glad to prosecute Mr. Dresden,

42:51.610 --> 42:54.690
just as soon as you bring
me unbiased evidence.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.980
But for now,Dresden's a free man.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.010
The blood of his future victims is on you.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.940
I warned you,Lieutenant,

43:07.040 --> 43:08.790
didn't I?

43:12.460 --> 43:14.190
Good day,gentlemen.
