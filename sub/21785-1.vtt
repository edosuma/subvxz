00:58.620 --> 01:02.140
Act I
Toulon, 1815

01:12.890 --> 01:15.280
Look down, look down

01:15.780 --> 01:18.410
Don't look 'em in the eye

01:18.840 --> 01:21.400
Look down, look down

01:21.810 --> 01:24.400
You're here until you die

01:25.060 --> 01:27.350
The sun is strong

01:27.810 --> 01:30.410
It's hot as hell below

01:30.950 --> 01:33.220
Look down, look down

01:33.710 --> 01:36.220
There's twenty years to go

01:36.650 --> 01:39.090
I've done no wrong!

01:39.580 --> 01:42.200
Sweet Jesus hear my prayer

01:42.650 --> 01:45.050
Look down, look down

01:45.440 --> 01:48.040
Sweet Jesus doesn't care

01:48.440 --> 01:50.930
I know she'll wait

01:51.340 --> 01:53.840
I know that she'll be true

01:54.250 --> 01:56.740
Look down, look down

01:57.170 --> 01:59.800
They've all forgotten you

02:00.400 --> 02:05.870
When I get free ya won't see me
Here for dust!

02:06.280 --> 02:08.520
Look down, look down

02:08.919 --> 02:11.380
Don't look 'em in the eye

02:11.780 --> 02:14.490
How long O Lord

02:14.910 --> 02:17.410
Before you let me die

02:17.820 --> 02:20.470
Look down, look down

02:20.870 --> 02:23.410
You'll always be a slave

02:23.770 --> 02:25.990
Look down, look down

02:26.660 --> 02:29.460
You're standing in your grave

02:29.910 --> 02:32.570
Now bring me prisoner 24601

02:33.040 --> 02:34.990
Your time is up
And your parole's begun

02:35.360 --> 02:36.710
You know what that means

02:37.390 --> 02:39.570
Yes, it means I'm free

02:40.890 --> 02:41.820
No!

02:42.230 --> 02:44.550
It means you get
Your yellow ticket-of-leave

02:44.990 --> 02:46.880
- You are a thief
- I stole a loaf of bread

02:47.230 --> 02:48.220
You robbed a house

02:48.930 --> 02:51.280
I broke a window pane

02:53.380 --> 02:55.520
My sister's child was close
to death

02:56.040 --> 02:58.580
- And we were starving
- And you will starve again

02:59.110 --> 03:01.560
Unless you learn the meaning
of the law

03:02.100 --> 03:08.730
I know the meaning of these 19 years
A slave of the law

03:10.740 --> 03:12.900
Five years for what you did

03:13.400 --> 03:15.270
The rest because you tried to run

03:15.750 --> 03:20.040
- Yes, 24601
- My name is Jean Valjean

03:20.570 --> 03:23.150
And I am Javert

03:23.930 --> 03:26.520
Do not forget my name

03:27.420 --> 03:28.920
Do not forget me, 24601

03:34.500 --> 03:36.460
Look down, look down

03:36.910 --> 03:39.530
You will always be a slave

03:39.910 --> 03:42.400
Look down, look down

03:42.840 --> 03:45.790
You're standing in your grave

04:00.910 --> 04:03.260
Freedom is mine

04:05.020 --> 04:07.300
The earth is still

04:07.720 --> 04:10.290
I feel the wind. I breathe again

04:10.670 --> 04:12.600
I breathe again

04:13.170 --> 04:15.650
And the sky clears

04:17.630 --> 04:20.459
The world is waiting

04:22.820 --> 04:27.380
Drink from the pool
How clean the taste

04:28.010 --> 04:31.040
Never forget the years,
the waste

04:33.450 --> 04:36.880
Nor forgive them, for 
what they've done

04:37.610 --> 04:39.370
They are the guilty...

04:39.730 --> 04:41.540
... everyone

04:42.290 --> 04:44.570
The day begins

04:44.910 --> 04:46.980
And now lets see

04:47.430 --> 04:49.790
What this new world
Will do for me

05:07.580 --> 05:10.360
You'll have to go
I'll pay you off for the day

05:10.840 --> 05:13.130
Collect your bits and pieces there
And be on your way, Valjean

05:14.030 --> 05:15.880
You've given me half
What the other men get

05:16.300 --> 05:18.070
This handful of tin
Wouldn't buy my sweat

05:18.670 --> 05:20.800
You broke the law
It's there for people to see

05:21.200 --> 05:24.730
Why should you get the same
As honest men like me

05:27.910 --> 05:30.860
And now I know how freedom feels
The jailer always at your heels

05:31.190 --> 05:32.590
It is the law!

05:32.920 --> 05:34.910
This piece of paper in my hand
That makes me cursed throughout the land

05:35.360 --> 05:36.790
It is the law!

05:37.120 --> 05:40.550
Like a cur
I walk the street

05:41.310 --> 05:45.780
The dirt beneath my feet

05:52.100 --> 05:57.040
Come in, Sir, for you are weary

05:57.680 --> 06:02.400
And the night is cold out there

06:03.160 --> 06:06.910
Though our lives are very humble

06:07.830 --> 06:12.910
What we have, we have to share

06:13.850 --> 06:18.170
There is wine here to revive you

06:19.080 --> 06:23.920
There is bread to make you strong

06:24.740 --> 06:28.290
There's a bed to rest till morning

06:28.960 --> 06:35.430
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong

06:38.370 --> 06:41.970
He let me eat my fill
I had the lion's share

06:42.350 --> 06:45.590
The silver in my hand
Cost twice what I had earned

06:46.280 --> 06:49.640
In all those nineteen years
That lifetime of despair

06:50.820 --> 06:53.090
And yet he trusted me

06:55.000 --> 06:58.780
The old fool trusted me
He's done his bit of good

06:59.140 --> 07:02.740
I played the grateful serf
And thanked him like I should

07:03.420 --> 07:07.130
But when the house was still,
I got up in the night

07:08.690 --> 07:10.600
Took the silver

07:11.060 --> 07:14.780
Took my flight

07:20.490 --> 07:25.110
"Valjean is arrested.
when the Bishop steps in"

07:25.910 --> 07:29.850
Tell his reverence your story
Let us see if he's impressed

07:30.270 --> 07:33.850
You were lodging there last night
You were the honest Bishop's guest.

07:34.270 --> 07:38.000
And then, out of Christian goodness
When he learned about your plight

07:38.370 --> 07:40.200
You maintain he made a present
of this silver

07:41.710 --> 07:43.620
That is right.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.110
But my friend you left so early

07:47.540 --> 07:50.220
Surely something slipped your mind

07:51.060 --> 07:53.860
You forgot I gave these also

07:54.440 --> 07:59.820
Would you leave the best behind?

08:00.210 --> 08:03.700
So Messieurs you may release him

08:04.260 --> 08:07.070
For this man has spoken true

08:07.510 --> 08:10.400
I commend you for your duty

08:11.010 --> 08:16.420
May God's blessing go with you.

08:19.310 --> 08:24.580
But remember this, my brother

08:24.970 --> 08:30.070
See in this some higher plan

08:30.620 --> 08:34.470
You must use this precious silver

08:34.850 --> 08:41.010
To become an honest man

08:41.440 --> 08:46.810
By the witness of the martyrs

08:47.230 --> 08:52.070
By the Passion and the Blood

08:52.830 --> 08:57.600
God has raised you out of darkness

08:58.050 --> 09:05.050
I have bought your soul for God

09:32.334 --> 09:34.186
What have I done, sweet Jesus,
what have I done

09:34.589 --> 09:36.776
Become a thief in the night,
become a dog on the run,

09:37.205 --> 09:39.409
Have I fallen so far, while
is the hour so late,

09:40.054 --> 09:41.853
That nothing remanes but
the cry of my hate,

09:42.241 --> 09:44.201
That cries in the dark,
that nobody hears,

09:44.736 --> 09:48.100
Here where I stand at the turning
of the years.

09:49.647 --> 09:51.720
If there is another way to go

09:52.073 --> 09:53.887
I risked it twenty long years ago,

09:54.353 --> 09:56.211
My life was a war
that could never be won

09:56.658 --> 09:58.714
They gave me a number
and murded Valjean

09:59.067 --> 10:01.261
Where they chained me
and let me for dead,

10:01.638 --> 10:04.684
Just for stealing a mouth
full of bread.

10:17.963 --> 10:21.671
Yet why did I allow that man,

10:22.411 --> 10:25.647
To touch my sould and teach me love,

10:27.144 --> 10:30.111
He treated me like any other,

10:30.892 --> 10:35.597
He gave me his trust,
He called me “brother”.

10:36.088 --> 10:39.779
My life he claimes for god above,

10:41.052 --> 10:44.621
Can such things be?

10:45.232 --> 10:48.784
For I had come to hate the world,

10:49.480 --> 10:53.267
This world that always hated me.

10:54.005 --> 10:57.395
Take a knife for an eye,

10:58.229 --> 11:01.608
Turn your heart into stone,

11:02.116 --> 11:05.327
This is all I have lived for,

11:05.841 --> 11:11.115
This is all I have known.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.624
One life from him, and I’ld be back,

11:21.371 --> 11:24.632
Beneath the lash upon the rack.

11:25.570 --> 11:28.780
Instead he offers me my freedom,

11:29.201 --> 11:33.563
I feel my shame inside me
like a knife,

11:34.079 --> 11:37.332
He told me that I had a soul.

11:38.427 --> 11:41.806
How does he know?

11:42.504 --> 11:46.152
What spirit comes to move my life,

11:47.029 --> 11:52.655
Is there another way to go.

11:54.600 --> 11:59.411
I am reaching, but I fall,

11:59.994 --> 12:03.504
And the night is closing in,

12:03.942 --> 12:07.040
And I stare into the void,

12:07.476 --> 12:10.421
To the whirpool of my sin,

12:10.875 --> 12:13.878
I’ll escape now from the world,

12:14.272 --> 12:16.778
From the world of Jean Valjean,

12:17.197 --> 12:20.010
Jean Valjean is nothing now,

12:20.407 --> 12:27.330
Another story must begin

12:36.174 --> 12:43.174
"Valjean brokes his parole,
leaving the town"

12:57.515 --> 13:00.397
Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823

13:02.809 --> 13:08.219
"The poor people are standing
outside of the Factory"

13:10.182 --> 13:13.192
At the end of the day you're
another day older

13:13.624 --> 13:16.229
And that's all you can say for
the life of the poor

13:16.747 --> 13:18.190
It's a struggle, it's a war

13:18.579 --> 13:19.843
And there's nothing that anyone's giving

13:20.273 --> 13:21.538
One more day, standing about,

13:21.900 --> 13:23.276
What is it for?

13:24.383 --> 13:26.150
One day less to be living.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.505
At the end of the day you're
another day colder

13:30.476 --> 13:33.221
And the shirt on your back doesn't
keep out the chill

13:33.678 --> 13:35.191
And the righteous hurry past

13:35.551 --> 13:37.188
They don't hear the little ones crying

13:37.514 --> 13:38.779
And the winter is coming on fast,

13:39.097 --> 13:40.767
Ready to kill

13:41.446 --> 13:43.462
One day nearer to dying!

13:44.126 --> 13:46.955
At the end of the day there's
another day dawning

13:47.849 --> 13:50.309
And the sun in the morning is
waiting to rise

13:51.102 --> 13:52.401
Like the waves crash on the sand

13:52.859 --> 13:54.329
Like a storm that'll break
any second

13:54.723 --> 13:56.074
There's a hunger in the land

13:56.488 --> 13:57.848
There's a reckoning still
to be reckoned

13:57.899 --> 14:03.904
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day!

14:04.115 --> 14:06.987
At the end of the day you get
nothing for nothing

14:07.582 --> 14:10.593
Sitting flat on your butt
doesn't buy any bread

14:11.041 --> 14:12.460
There are children back at home

14:12.810 --> 14:14.187
And the children have got
to be fed

14:14.593 --> 14:16.053
And you're lucky to be in a job

14:16.442 --> 14:18.412
And in a bed!

14:18.885 --> 14:21.474
And we're counting our blessings!

14:23.453 --> 14:26.834
Have you seen how the foreman
is fuming today?

14:27.222 --> 14:30.421
With his terrible breath
and his wandering hands?

14:31.048 --> 14:33.026
It's because little Fantine
won't give him his way

14:33.424 --> 14:36.020
Take a look at his trousers,
you'll see where he stands!

14:36.778 --> 14:39.985
At the end of the day
it's another day over

14:40.467 --> 14:43.417
With enough in your pocket to last
for a week

14:43.771 --> 14:45.474
Pay the landlord pay the shop

14:45.799 --> 14:47.315
Keep on grafting as long
as you're able

14:47.676 --> 14:49.070
Keep on grafting till you drop

14:49.394 --> 14:50.840
Or it's back to the crumbs
on the table

14:51.176 --> 14:53.508
You've got to pay your way

14:54.084 --> 14:55.975
At the end of the day!

14:58.914 --> 15:02.312
What have we here, little
innocent sister?

15:02.912 --> 15:05.994
Come on Fantine, let's have
all the news!

15:06.559 --> 15:08.377
Dear Fantine you must send us
more money...

15:08.883 --> 15:11.508
Your child needs a doctor.
There's no time to lose!

15:11.849 --> 15:14.773
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business

15:15.325 --> 15:18.525
With a husband at home
and a bit on the side

15:19.018 --> 15:20.746
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God

15:21.147 --> 15:25.296
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

15:25.674 --> 15:29.793
"Fantine and the girl
fight over the letter"

15:31.377 --> 15:32.830
What is this fighting all about?

15:33.337 --> 15:34.586
Will someone tear these two apart?

15:34.936 --> 15:37.400
This is a factory, not a circus!

15:38.137 --> 15:40.149
Now come on ladies, settle down

15:41.723 --> 15:43.205
I run a business of repute

15:43.564 --> 15:45.965
I am the Mayor of this town

15:46.317 --> 15:47.840
I look to you to sort this out

15:48.183 --> 15:49.483
And be as patient as you can

15:49.820 --> 15:52.648
Now someone say how this began!

15:53.332 --> 15:56.677
At the end of the day she's
the one who began it

15:57.169 --> 16:00.023
There's a kid that she's hiding
in some little town

16:00.540 --> 16:02.090
There's a man she has to pay

16:02.511 --> 16:04.023
You can guess how she picks up
the extra

16:04.411 --> 16:05.786
You can bet she's earning her

16:06.182 --> 16:08.315
Keep sleeping around

16:08.729 --> 16:11.430
And the boss wouldn't like it!

16:11.782 --> 16:15.017
Yes it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter

16:15.430 --> 16:18.002
And her father abandoned us
leaving us flat

16:18.680 --> 16:20.728
Now she lives with an innkeeper
man and his wife

16:21.134 --> 16:23.532
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that??

16:24.630 --> 16:27.888
At the end of the day she'll be
nothing but trouble

16:28.344 --> 16:31.194
And there's trouble for all
when there's trouble for one

16:31.708 --> 16:32.938
While we're earning
our daily bread

16:33.414 --> 16:34.779
She's the one with her hands
in the butter

16:35.193 --> 16:36.432
You must send the slut away

16:36.905 --> 16:38.496
Or we're all gonna end
in the gutter

16:38.883 --> 16:41.542
And it's us who'll have to pay

16:41.929 --> 16:43.040
At the end of the day!

16:43.398 --> 16:44.845
I might have known the bitch
could bite

16:45.207 --> 16:48.872
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret

16:50.511 --> 16:53.179
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine

16:54.066 --> 16:55.838
Who keeps herself so pure and clean

16:56.191 --> 16:58.324
You'd be the cause I had no doubt

16:59.011 --> 17:00.353
Of any trouble hereabout

17:00.775 --> 17:02.195
You play a virgin in the light

17:02.588 --> 17:04.252
But need no urgin' in the night.

17:04.707 --> 17:06.823
She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men

17:07.243 --> 17:08.415
She'll be nothing but trouble
again and again

17:08.776 --> 17:10.193
You must sack her today

17:10.674 --> 17:11.982
Sack the girl today!

17:12.681 --> 17:18.694
Right my girl!
On your way...

17:48.622 --> 17:52.260
There was a time when men
were kind

17:52.710 --> 17:54.301
When their voices were soft

17:56.030 --> 17:58.784
And their words inviting

17:59.471 --> 18:02.715
There was a time when love
was blind

18:03.342 --> 18:06.035
And the world was a song

18:06.931 --> 18:09.168
And the song was exciting

18:10.509 --> 18:12.186
There was a time

18:15.008 --> 18:20.737
Then it all went wrong

18:36.960 --> 18:43.290
I dreamed a dream in times gone

18:44.561 --> 18:46.025
When hope was high

18:46.419 --> 18:49.208
And life worth living

18:51.494 --> 18:58.305
I dreamed that love would
never die

18:59.028 --> 19:05.247
I dreamed that God would
be forgiving

19:06.900 --> 19:11.990
Then I was young and unafraid

19:13.502 --> 19:18.656
And dreams were made and used
and wasted

19:21.356 --> 19:27.781
There was no ransom to be paid

19:28.812 --> 19:30.353
No song unsung

19:30.655 --> 19:33.415
No wine untasted

19:36.435 --> 19:42.300
But the tigers come at night

19:42.921 --> 19:48.829
With their voices soft as thunder

19:49.275 --> 19:54.426
As they tear your hope apart

19:56.312 --> 20:03.312
And they turn your dream to shame

20:09.738 --> 20:14.986
He slept a summer by my side

20:15.722 --> 20:20.833
He filled my days with
endless wonder

20:22.243 --> 20:28.031
He took my childhood in his stride

20:28.659 --> 20:35.033
But he was gone when autumn came

20:38.104 --> 20:43.599
And still I dream he'll come to me

20:44.185 --> 20:49.148
That we'll live the years together

20:49.920 --> 20:55.477
But there are dreams that cannot be

20:55.915 --> 21:02.135
And there are storms we cannot weather

21:04.834 --> 21:10.022
I had a dream my life would

21:10.889 --> 21:14.253
So much different from this hell
I'm living

21:14.803 --> 21:21.762
So different now from what it seemed

21:23.861 --> 21:27.472
Now life has killed

21:28.068 --> 21:35.068
The dream I dreamed

22:02.541 --> 22:07.091
"Red light District"

22:09.892 --> 22:12.283
I smell women
Smell 'em in the air

22:12.824 --> 22:15.252
Think I'll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there

22:15.809 --> 22:18.483
Lovely ladies
Smell 'em through the smoke

22:18.880 --> 22:21.408
Seven days at sea
Can make you hungry for a poke

22:22.046 --> 22:24.606
Even stokers need a little stoke

22:25.047 --> 22:27.454
Lovely ladies waiting for a bite

22:27.988 --> 22:30.559
Waiting for the customer
who only comes at night

22:30.954 --> 22:33.484
Lovely ladies
Waiting for the call

22:34.016 --> 22:36.450
Standing up or lying down
Or any way at all

22:36.966 --> 22:40.021
Bargain prices up
against the wall

22:41.234 --> 22:46.343
What pretty hair
What pretty locks you got there

22:47.306 --> 22:52.569
What luck you got, it's worth
a centime. my dear

22:53.542 --> 22:54.969
I'll take the lot

22:55.424 --> 22:57.379
Don't touch me, leave me alone

22:58.127 --> 23:03.004
Let's make a price, I'll give
you all of ten francs

23:04.096 --> 23:05.429
Just think of that!

23:05.819 --> 23:08.021
- It pays a debt
- Just think of that

23:08.536 --> 23:11.075
What can I do? It pays a debt

23:11.531 --> 23:17.068
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette

23:18.202 --> 23:20.510
Old men, young men, take 'em
as they come

23:20.905 --> 23:23.758
Harbor rats and alley cats and
every type of scum

23:24.182 --> 23:26.761
Poor men, rich men, leaders
of the land

23:27.182 --> 23:29.770
See them with their trousers off
they're never quite as grand

23:30.158 --> 23:33.814
All it takes is money in your hand!

23:34.031 --> 23:41.031
"Fantine sells her hair and goods
and becomes a prostitute,

23:41.036 --> 23:43.036
in order to help her daughter
Cosette"

23:46.786 --> 23:50.733
Come on, Captain, you can
wear your shoes

23:51.299 --> 23:55.309
Don't it make a change to have
a girl who can't refuse

23:55.768 --> 23:59.420
Easy money lying on a bed

23:59.944 --> 24:03.988
Just as well they never see
the hatred's in your head

24:04.469 --> 24:12.369
Don't they know they're making
love to one already dead!

24:15.357 --> 24:19.065
Here's something new, I think
I'll give it a try.

24:20.268 --> 24:25.496
Come closer you! I like
to see what I buy

24:26.140 --> 24:31.707
The usual price, for just
a slice of your pie

24:33.916 --> 24:36.424
I don't want you, no, no,
M'sieur, let me go.

24:37.011 --> 24:38.784
Is this a trick? I won't pay more!

24:39.118 --> 24:39.971
No, not at all.

24:40.332 --> 24:44.546
You've got some nerve, you little whore
You've got some gall.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.094
It's the same with a tart
as it is with a grocer

24:49.549 --> 24:52.758
The customer sees what he gets in advance

24:53.162 --> 24:54.848
It's not for the whore to say
'yes sir' or 'no sir'

24:55.398 --> 24:57.808
It's not for the harlot to pick and
to choose or lead me to a dance!

24:59.415 --> 25:02.615
I'll kill you, you bastard,
try any of that!

25:03.130 --> 25:09.040
Even a whore who has gone to
the bad won't be had by a rat!

25:14.257 --> 25:16.044
Tell me quickly what's the story

25:16.431 --> 25:17.920
Who saw what and why and where

25:18.375 --> 25:21.825
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert!

25:22.272 --> 25:26.005
In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all

25:26.459 --> 25:29.701
Who laid hands on this good man here?
What's the substance of this brawl?

25:30.246 --> 25:34.305
Javert, would you believe it
I was crossing from the park

25:34.922 --> 25:37.073
When this prostitute attacked me

25:37.408 --> 25:40.075
You can see she left her mark

25:40.452 --> 25:41.993
She will answer for her actions

25:42.398 --> 25:43.783
When you make a full report

25:44.240 --> 25:45.760
You may rest assured, M'sieur

25:46.192 --> 25:47.853
That she will answer to the court

25:48.419 --> 25:50.447
There's a child who sorely needs me

25:50.920 --> 25:52.798
Please M'sieur, she's but that high

25:53.270 --> 25:55.385
Holy God, is there no mercy

25:55.841 --> 25:59.634
If I go to jail she'll die!

26:00.046 --> 26:04.752
I have heard such protestations
Every day for twenty years

26:05.294 --> 26:10.239
Let's have no more explanations
Save your breath and save your tears

26:10.686 --> 26:12.914
Honest work, just reward

26:13.310 --> 26:16.578
That's the way to please the Lord

26:21.146 --> 26:23.545
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale

26:24.001 --> 26:25.600
But M'sieur Mayor!

26:26.392 --> 26:28.688
You've done your duty.Let her be
She needs a doctor, not a jail.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.519
But M'sieur Mayor!

26:30.855 --> 26:32.515
Can this be?

26:32.834 --> 26:39.535
Where will she end this child
without a friend?

26:41.487 --> 26:48.487
I've seen your face before
Show me some way to help you

26:53.280 --> 27:00.065
How have you come to grief
In a place such as this?

27:02.912 --> 27:07.849
M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray

27:08.580 --> 27:13.517
It's hard enough I've lost my pride

27:14.309 --> 27:21.309
You let your foreman send me away
Yes, you were there, and turned aside

27:31.021 --> 27:34.470
I never did no wrong

27:34.816 --> 27:40.253
- Is it true, what I have done?
- My daughter's close to dying

27:40.674 --> 27:45.775
- To an innocent soul?
- If there's a God above

27:46.300 --> 27:51.884
- In His name my task has just begun
- He'd let me die instead

27:55.177 --> 28:01.992
- In His name my task has just begun
- But M'sieur Mayor!

28:02.405 --> 28:05.123
- I will see it done!
- But M'sieur Mayor!

28:05.853 --> 28:09.142
I will see it done!

28:10.791 --> 28:14.260
"Fantine is driven to the Hospital"

28:19.147 --> 28:26.147
"A cart has fallen on its driver
and threatens to crush him"

28:34.481 --> 28:41.481
"The Mayor rescues him, by lifting
the cart entirely on his own"

28:53.679 --> 28:57.704
Can this be true?
I don't believe what I see!

28:58.064 --> 29:01.231
A man your age
To be as strong as you are

29:01.807 --> 29:07.026
A memory stirs..
You make me think of a man

29:07.569 --> 29:14.569
From years ago a man who broke
his parole. He disappeared

29:18.018 --> 29:20.288
Forgive me, Sir,
I would not dare.

29:20.702 --> 29:24.339
Say what you must, don't leave
it there

29:25.836 --> 29:30.205
I have only known one other
Who can do what you have done

29:30.687 --> 29:35.013
He's a convict from the chain gang
He's been ten years on the run

29:35.547 --> 29:39.934
But he couldn't run forever
We have found his hideaway

29:40.396 --> 29:44.894
And he's just been re-arrested
And he comes to court today

29:45.772 --> 29:50.350
Of course he now denies it
You'd expect that of a con

29:50.692 --> 29:57.692
But he couldn't run forever,
No, not even Jean Valjean

30:14.277 --> 30:17.994
He thinks that man is me,
he knew him at a glance

30:18.388 --> 30:21.907
The stranger he has found,
This man could be my chance

30:22.334 --> 30:25.451
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right his wrong

30:26.035 --> 30:30.266
When I have come so far,
And struggled for so long.

30:32.527 --> 30:37.138
If I speak, I am condemned

30:38.394 --> 30:45.139
If I stay silent I am damned

30:45.648 --> 30:50.122
I am the master of hundreds of workers
They all look to me

30:50.886 --> 30:56.280
How can I abandon them, how can
they live, if I am not free?

30:59.866 --> 31:05.027
If I speak, I am condemned

31:05.552 --> 31:12.552
If I stay silent, I am damned!

31:21.185 --> 31:23.518
Who am I?

31:24.015 --> 31:27.304
Can I condemn this man to slavery

31:27.784 --> 31:32.103
Pretend I do not see his agony

31:33.092 --> 31:36.397
This innocent who bears my face

31:36.801 --> 31:38.257
Who am I?

31:38.617 --> 31:41.783
Can I conceal myself for evermore

31:42.177 --> 31:46.444
Pretend I'm not the man I was before

31:47.041 --> 31:50.763
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?

31:51.150 --> 31:52.474
Must I lie?

31:52.803 --> 31:55.384
How can I ever face my fellow man

31:55.854 --> 31:59.794
How can I ever face myself again

32:00.792 --> 32:02.271
My soul belongs to God, I know

32:02.615 --> 32:04.162
I made that bargain long ago

32:04.534 --> 32:07.124
He gave me hope, when hope was gone

32:07.552 --> 32:12.335
He gave me strength to journey on

32:13.107 --> 32:16.013
Who am I?

32:18.795 --> 32:19.782
Who am I?

32:20.153 --> 32:23.920
I am Jean Valjean!

32:26.405 --> 32:28.366
And so Javert, you see it's true

32:28.796 --> 32:32.339
That man bears no more guilt than you

32:32.924 --> 32:35.608
Who am I?

32:50.671 --> 32:57.671
"He decides to declare himself, showing
the court, about to condemn the false Valjean"

33:03.132 --> 33:09.591
"Valjean escapes and Javert
is in his pursuite"

33:28.541 --> 33:35.541
"A dying Fantine dreams
with Cosette"

33:41.149 --> 33:46.732
Cosette, it's turned so cold

33:48.124 --> 33:54.886
Cosette, it's past your bedtime

33:55.326 --> 34:02.326
You've played the day away,
and soon it will be night

34:07.483 --> 34:14.483
Come to me, Cosette the light
is fading

34:16.505 --> 34:23.505
Don't you see the evening star
appearing?

34:25.484 --> 34:32.366
Come to me, and rest against
my shoulder

34:32.934 --> 34:39.210
How fast the minutes fly away
and every minute colder.

34:40.286 --> 34:47.286
Hurry near, another day is dying

34:49.179 --> 34:56.179
Don't you hear, the winter wind
is crying?

34:57.980 --> 35:04.438
There's a darkness which comes
without a warning

35:05.076 --> 35:11.268
But I will sing you lullabies
and wake you in the morning

35:11.943 --> 35:18.943
Oh Fantine, your time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life

35:24.137 --> 35:31.137
- Look M'sieur, where all the children play
- Be at peace.Be at peace evermore

35:36.518 --> 35:41.172
- My Cosette...
- Shall live in my protection

35:42.092 --> 35:47.779
- Take her now
- Your child will want for nothing

35:48.485 --> 35:55.485
- Good M'sieur, you come from God in heaven
- And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living

36:00.657 --> 36:07.657
- Take my hand, the night grows ever colder
- And I will keep you warm

36:10.168 --> 36:17.168
- Take my child, I give her to your keeping
- Take shelter from the storm

36:19.550 --> 36:25.349
For God's sake, please stay 'till
I am sleeping

36:25.829 --> 36:32.829
And tell Cosette I love her, and
I'll see her when I wake.

36:38.962 --> 36:45.962
"Fantine dies"

36:51.520 --> 36:58.520
"Javert arrives to arrest Valjean"

37:00.092 --> 37:05.210
Valjean, at last,
We see each other plain

37:05.727 --> 37:10.973
`M'sieur le Mayor',
You'll wear a different chain.

37:11.672 --> 37:17.229
Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again

37:17.582 --> 37:22.021
Listen to me! There is something I must do.

37:22.736 --> 37:27.733
This woman leaves behind a suffering child.
There is none but me who can intercede,

37:28.242 --> 37:33.257
In Mercy's name, three days are all I need.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.327
Then I'll return, I pledge my word.

37:36.748 --> 37:39.115
- Then I'll return.
- You must think me mad!

37:39.646 --> 37:45.166
I've hunted you across the years
A man like you can never change.

37:45.505 --> 37:50.232
A man... such as you...

37:51.127 --> 37:53.836
- Believe of me what you will
- Men like me can never change

37:54.198 --> 37:56.079
- There is a duty that I'm sworn
- Men like you can never change

37:56.570 --> 37:59.607
- You know nothing of my life
- No, 24601

38:00.233 --> 38:02.874
- All I did was steal some bread
- My duty's to the law

38:03.296 --> 38:05.346
- You know nothing of the world
- You have no rights

38:05.381 --> 38:07.396
- You would rather see me dead
- Come with me 24601

38:07.904 --> 38:10.167
- But not before I see this justice done
- Now the wheel has turned around

38:10.708 --> 38:14.750
- I am warning you Javert
- Jean Valjean is nothing now

38:15.481 --> 38:18.337
- I'm a stronger man by far
- Dare you talk to me of crime

38:19.053 --> 38:22.518
- There is power in me yet
- Every man is born in sin

38:23.042 --> 38:25.813
- My race is not yet run
- I was born with scum like you

38:26.623 --> 38:31.438
- If I have to kill you here
- I was born inside a jail

38:48.218 --> 38:53.842
- And this I swear to you tonight
- There is no place for you to hide

38:54.816 --> 39:01.213
- Your child will live within my care
- Wherever you may hide away

39:01.745 --> 39:05.617
And I will raise her to the light.

39:06.202 --> 39:13.202
I swear to you, I will be there!

39:19.129 --> 39:26.129
"They fight, Javert is knocked out.
Valjean escapes."

39:32.086 --> 39:39.086
"The inn of Montfermeil"

39:57.910 --> 40:03.147
There is a castle on a cloud

40:03.569 --> 40:08.437
I like to go there in my sleep

40:08.885 --> 40:13.393
Aren't any floors for me
to sweep

40:13.866 --> 40:19.070
Not in my castle on a cloud

40:19.567 --> 40:24.676
There is a room that's full of toys

40:25.151 --> 40:29.743
There are a hundred boys and girls

40:30.192 --> 40:35.067
Nobody shouts or talks too loud

40:35.481 --> 40:40.528
Not in my castle on a cloud

40:41.204 --> 40:44.947
There is a lady all in white

40:45.481 --> 40:49.024
Holds me and sings a lullaby

40:49.480 --> 40:53.684
She´s nice to see and she´s 
soft to touch 

40:54.184 --> 41:00.924
She says: "Cosette, I love 
you very much."

41:01.493 --> 41:07.030
I know a place where no one's lost

41:07.476 --> 41:12.041
I know a place where no one cries

41:12.422 --> 41:17.236
Crying at all is not allowed

41:17.684 --> 41:23.770
Not in my castle on a cloud

41:26.178 --> 41:28.399
Oh help! I think I hear them now

41:28.776 --> 41:32.483
and I'm nowhere near finished sweeping
and scrubbing and polishing the floor

41:32.862 --> 41:36.540
Oh, it's her! It's Madame

41:37.280 --> 41:39.517
Now look who's here

41:41.631 --> 41:44.211
The little madam herself

41:44.814 --> 41:48.544
Pretending once again she's been
`so awfully good'

41:49.801 --> 41:53.293
Better not let me catch you slacking
Better not catch my eye

41:53.714 --> 41:58.366
Ten rotten francs your mother sends me
What is that going to buy

41:59.097 --> 42:02.993
Now take that pail
my little `Mademoiselle'

42:03.478 --> 42:06.100
And go and draw some water
from the well

42:07.768 --> 42:11.436
We should never have taken you in in the
first place.How stupid, the things that we do!

42:11.738 --> 42:14.327
Like mother like daughter,
the scum of the street

42:15.737 --> 42:20.112
Still there Cosette?
Your tears will do you no good

42:20.542 --> 42:24.890
I told you fetch some water from
the well in the wood.

42:25.390 --> 42:29.541
Please do not send me out alone

42:30.581 --> 42:33.951
Not in the darkness on my own

42:34.363 --> 42:40.329
Enough of that, or I'll forget
to be nice

42:42.196 --> 42:48.282
You heard me ask for something,
And I never ask twice!

43:02.668 --> 43:05.488
Enter M'sieur
Sit yourself down

43:06.002 --> 43:10.569
And meet the best
innkeeper in town

43:10.989 --> 43:13.844
As for the rest
all of 'em crooks

43:14.300 --> 43:18.321
Rooking their guests
and cooking the books

43:19.595 --> 43:25.182
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me

43:25.999 --> 43:31.379
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

43:32.136 --> 43:34.930
Master of the house,
doling out the charm

43:35.410 --> 43:37.971
Ready with a handshake
and an open palm

43:38.360 --> 43:41.050
Tells a saucy tale
makes a little stir

43:41.444 --> 43:44.074
Customers appreciate
a bon-viveur

43:44.582 --> 43:49.903
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice

43:50.641 --> 43:56.203
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

43:56.899 --> 43:59.434
Master of the house
Keeper of the zoo

43:59.882 --> 44:02.493
Ready to relieve 'em
of a sou or two

44:02.890 --> 44:05.683
Watering the wine,
making up the weight

44:06.140 --> 44:08.753
Pickin' up their knick-knacks
when they can't see straight

44:09.141 --> 44:14.840
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's busom friend

44:15.279 --> 44:19.844
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

44:20.229 --> 44:22.519
Master of the house
Quick to catch yer eye

44:23.052 --> 44:25.535
Never wants a passerby
To pass him by

44:26.052 --> 44:28.751
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

44:29.138 --> 44:31.743
Comforter, philosopher,
And lifelong mate!

44:32.181 --> 44:37.693
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone

44:38.251 --> 44:43.169
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

44:47.251 --> 44:50.363
Enter M'sieur
Lay down your load

44:50.766 --> 44:55.125
Unlace your boots
And rest from the road

44:56.251 --> 44:59.129
This weighs a ton
Travel's a curse

44:59.628 --> 45:04.098
But here we strive
To lighten your purse

45:05.534 --> 45:10.966
Here the goose is cooked
Here the fat is fried

45:11.516 --> 45:17.489
And nothing's overlooked
Till I'm satisfied

45:18.555 --> 45:21.159
Food beyond compare
Food beyond belief

45:21.563 --> 45:24.295
Mix it in a mincer
And pretend it's beef

45:24.717 --> 45:27.638
Kidney of a horse
Liver of a cat

45:27.967 --> 45:30.820
Filling up the sausages
With this and that

45:31.156 --> 45:36.887
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied

45:37.325 --> 45:42.929
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side!

45:43.531 --> 45:46.299
Charge 'em for the lice
Extra for the mice

45:46.669 --> 45:49.444
Two percent for looking in the
mirror twice

45:49.840 --> 45:52.393
Here a little slice
There a little cut

45:52.806 --> 45:55.796
Three percent for sleeping with
the window shut

45:56.621 --> 46:01.753
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks he knows

46:02.216 --> 46:07.339
How it all increases all those bits and
pieces,Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

46:08.556 --> 46:10.937
Master of the house
Quick to catch yer eye

46:11.522 --> 46:14.006
Never wants a passerby
To pass him by

46:14.451 --> 46:17.133
Servent to the poor
Butler to the great

46:17.701 --> 46:20.168
Comforter, philosopher,
And lifelong mate!

46:20.657 --> 46:26.046
Everybody's boon companion
gives 'em everything he's got

46:26.657 --> 46:31.710
Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus! What a sorry little lot!

46:37.075 --> 46:42.818
I used to dream
That I would meet a prince

46:43.265 --> 46:48.714
But God Almighty, have you seen
what's happened since?

46:50.675 --> 46:54.278
Master of the house?
Isn't worth me spit!

46:54.742 --> 46:58.586
`Comforter, philosopher'
- and lifelong shit!

46:59.056 --> 47:02.960
Cunning little brain,
regular Voltaire

47:03.466 --> 47:07.713
Thinks he's quite a lover
But there's not much there

47:08.065 --> 47:15.061
What a cruel trick of nature
Landed me with such a louse

47:15.448 --> 47:19.830
God knows how I've lasted living
with this bastard in the house!

47:20.165 --> 47:22.435
- Master of the house!
- Master and a half!

47:22.891 --> 47:25.606
- `Comforter, philosopher'
- Ah, don't make me laugh!

47:25.994 --> 47:28.418
- Servant to the poor
- Butler to the great

47:28.839 --> 47:31.631
Hypocrite and toady
And inebriate!

47:31.932 --> 47:37.295
Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

47:37.778 --> 47:43.827
- Everybody raise a glass
- Raise it up the master's arse

47:44.180 --> 47:48.279
Everybody raise a glass to the
master of the house!

48:38.807 --> 48:44.427
"Valjean visits the Thenardiers"

48:45.872 --> 48:49.902
I found her wandering in the wood
This little child, trembling in the shadows

48:51.012 --> 48:57.501
And I am here to help Cosette and I
will settle any debt you may think proper

49:00.034 --> 49:04.659
I will pay what I must pay
To take Cosette away.

49:13.878 --> 49:17.695
What to do? What to say?

49:18.269 --> 49:22.449
Shall you carry our treasure away?

49:22.903 --> 49:29.903
What a gem! What a pearl!
Beyond rubies is our little girl!

49:31.291 --> 49:38.291
How can we speak of debt?
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette!

49:42.061 --> 49:49.061
Dear Fantine, gone to rest
Have we done for her child what is best?

49:50.680 --> 49:57.680
Shared our bread, shared each bone
Treated her like she's one of our own!

49:59.594 --> 50:02.232
Like our own, Monsieur!

50:03.924 --> 50:09.184
Your feelings do you credit, sir
And I will ease the parting blow

50:09.786 --> 50:16.786
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or
greed. Now, may I say, we are agreed?

50:19.430 --> 50:26.430
That would quite fit the bill
If she hadn't so often been ill

50:28.883 --> 50:35.883
Little dear, cost us dear
Medicines are expensive, M'sieur

50:37.452 --> 50:44.452
Not that we begrudged a sou. It's
no more than we Christians must do!

50:49.252 --> 50:56.252
One thing more, one small doubt
There are treacherous people about

50:58.133 --> 51:05.133
No offense, please reflect. Your
intentions may not be... correct?

51:09.365 --> 51:16.365
No more words, here's your price.
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice

51:17.487 --> 51:24.487
Come, Cosette, say goodbye,
Let us seek out some friendlier sky.

51:26.174 --> 51:33.174
Thank you both for Cosette
It won't take you too long to forget.

51:40.136 --> 51:45.683
"Valjean takes Cosette with him to Paris"

51:47.805 --> 51:54.805
"Paris, 10 years later"

51:56.464 --> 52:01.331
Look down, look down,
and see the beggars at your feet

52:02.150 --> 52:07.558
Look down and show some mercy
if you can

52:07.998 --> 52:13.173
Look down and see
The sweepings of the streets

52:13.579 --> 52:15.994
Look down, look down

52:16.476 --> 52:19.220
Upon your fellow man

52:19.685 --> 52:22.179
How do you do? My name's Gavroche

52:22.607 --> 52:24.953
These are my people, here's my patch

52:25.412 --> 52:27.698
Not much to look at, nothing posh

52:28.189 --> 52:30.366
Nothing that you'd call up
to scratch

52:30.812 --> 52:33.133
This is my school, my high society

52:33.581 --> 52:35.763
Here in the slums of Saint Michele

52:36.186 --> 52:38.618
We live on crumbs of humble piety

52:39.047 --> 52:41.302
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell

52:41.834 --> 52:44.079
Think you're poor?
Think you're free?

52:44.533 --> 52:46.794
Follow me, follow me

52:47.101 --> 52:51.975
Look down, and show some mercy
if you can

52:52.422 --> 52:57.900
Look down, look down, upon
your fellow man

53:06.239 --> 53:08.569
What you think yer at?
Hanging round me pitch

53:08.929 --> 53:11.079
If you're new around here, girl
You've got a lot to learn

53:11.551 --> 53:13.934
Listen you old bat
Crazy bloody witch

53:14.312 --> 53:16.468
'Least I give my customers
some pleasure in return

53:16.890 --> 53:19.118
I know what you give!
Give 'em all the pox

53:19.575 --> 53:22.006
Spread around your poison
Till they end up in a box

53:22.376 --> 53:24.603
Leave the poor old cow,
Move it, Madeleine

53:25.007 --> 53:27.475
She used to be no better
Till the clap got to her brain

53:27.852 --> 53:29.959
When's it gonna end?
When we gonna live

53:30.484 --> 53:32.599
Something's gotta happen now or
Something's gonna give...

53:32.987 --> 53:34.972
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come

53:37.340 --> 53:42.078
Where the leaders of the land? Where
are the swells who run this show

53:42.707 --> 53:47.705
Only one man - and that's Lamarque
Speaks for these people here below

53:48.104 --> 53:50.814
See our children fed
Help us in our shame

53:51.201 --> 53:52.714
Something for a crust of bread
In Holy Jesus' name

53:53.056 --> 53:54.096
In the Lord's Holy name

53:54.424 --> 53:55.415
In his name, in his name,
in his name

53:56.185 --> 54:01.353
Lamarque is ill and fading fast!
Won't last the week out so they say

54:01.800 --> 54:06.692
With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day

54:07.096 --> 54:14.096
Before we cut the fat ones down to
size? Before the barricades arise?

54:20.335 --> 54:25.760
Look down, look down, and show
some mercy if you can

54:26.223 --> 54:32.361
Look down, look down, upon
your fellow man

54:34.093 --> 54:41.093
"Javert continues the pursuit
of Valjean"

54:49.275 --> 54:56.275
There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running

54:59.280 --> 55:06.267
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace

55:07.146 --> 55:13.728
God be my witness
I never shall yield

55:14.193 --> 55:20.883
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

55:22.088 --> 55:28.793
He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord

55:29.471 --> 55:36.471
And those who follow the path of the
righteous shall have their reward

55:37.707 --> 55:41.740
And if they fall
As Lucifer fell

55:42.173 --> 55:47.645
The flame
The sword!

55:48.351 --> 55:55.351
Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted

55:59.362 --> 56:06.179
Filling the darkness
With order and light

56:07.149 --> 56:13.951
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure

56:14.345 --> 56:20.913
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

56:21.971 --> 56:28.101
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim

56:28.513 --> 56:35.405
And each in your season
returns and returns

56:37.063 --> 56:40.986
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell

56:41.404 --> 56:46.364
You fall in flame

56:46.872 --> 56:53.872
And so it has been and so it is
written on the doorway to paradise

56:55.527 --> 56:58.786
That those who falter and
those who fall

56:59.335 --> 57:03.632
Must pay the price

57:12.451 --> 57:19.451
Lord let me find him, that I may
see him safe behind bars

57:23.756 --> 57:30.756
I will never rest till then

57:31.600 --> 57:34.706
This I swear

57:35.101 --> 57:41.477
This I swear by the stars

58:17.888 --> 58:24.888
"The ABC Café and the students"

58:30.923 --> 58:32.866
At Notre Dame
The sections are prepared!

58:33.648 --> 58:34.861
At rue de Bac
They're straining at the leash!

58:35.240 --> 58:38.213
Students, workers, everyone
There's a river on the run

58:38.548 --> 58:42.140
Like the flowing of the tide
Paris coming to our side!

58:42.606 --> 58:49.551
The time is near, so near. It's
stirring the blood in their veins!

58:50.461 --> 58:57.461
And yet beware...
Don't let the wine go to your brains!

58:59.373 --> 59:01.815
For the army we fight is a
dangerous foe

59:02.279 --> 59:04.478
With the men and the arms that
we never can match

59:04.943 --> 59:07.822
Oh, it's easy to sit here and
swat 'em like

59:08.243 --> 59:10.736
But the national guard will be
harder to catch

59:11.174 --> 59:16.074
We need a sign
To rally the people

59:16.530 --> 59:20.209
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!

59:21.342 --> 59:23.638
- Marius, you're late
- What's wrong today?

59:24.144 --> 59:29.617
- You look as if you've seen a ghost
- Some wine and say what's going on

59:30.351 --> 59:33.099
A ghost you say...
A ghost maybe

59:33.616 --> 59:40.509
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, and she was gone

59:43.483 --> 59:49.275
I am agog!I am aghast!
Is Marius in love at last

59:49.791 --> 59:56.367
I have never heard him
'ooh' and 'aah'

59:56.806 --> 01:00:02.460
You talk of battles to be won
But here he comes like Don Ju-an

01:00:03.339 --> 01:00:07.703
It's better than an o-per-a

01:00:20.065 --> 01:00:25.861
It is time for us all
To decide who we are...

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:31.259
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now

01:00:31.937 --> 01:00:36.818
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay

01:00:37.394 --> 01:00:41.350
Is it simply a game for
rich young boys to play

01:00:41.754 --> 01:00:48.560
The color of the world
is changing day by day

01:00:49.496 --> 01:00:52.736
Red - the blood of angry men

01:00:53.259 --> 01:00:57.025
Black - the dark of ages past!

01:00:57.491 --> 01:01:01.264
Red - a world about to dawn

01:01:01.804 --> 01:01:06.799
Black - the night that ends at last

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:12.712
Had you been there tonight
You might know how it feels

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:19.854
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight

01:01:20.274 --> 01:01:24.787
Had you been there tonight
You might also have known

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:29.291
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light!

01:01:29.668 --> 01:01:35.736
And what was right seems wrong
and what was wrong seems right

01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:40.292
- Red...
- I feel my soul on fire

01:01:40.877 --> 01:01:44.511
- Black...
- My world if she's not there

01:01:45.192 --> 01:01:48.714
- Red...
- The color of desire!

01:01:49.326 --> 01:01:55.222
- Black...
- The color of despair

01:01:56.115 --> 01:02:00.910
Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.823
But now there is a higher call

01:02:05.216 --> 01:02:09.248
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive toward a larger goal

01:02:09.747 --> 01:02:12.860
Our little lives don't count at all

01:02:13.372 --> 01:02:16.922
- Red
- The blood of angry men

01:02:17.482 --> 01:02:20.953
- Black
- The dark of ages past

01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:25.139
- Red
- A world about to dawn!

01:02:25.673 --> 01:02:32.673
- Black
- The night that ends at last!

01:03:01.368 --> 01:03:04.962
Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns?
Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short

01:03:05.306 --> 01:03:08.436
Grantaire, put the bottle down!
Do we have the guns we need

01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:11.761
Give me brandy on my breath
And I'll breath 'em all to death

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.955
- In St. Antoine they're with us to a man!
- In Notre Dame they're tearing up the stones

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.792
- Twenty rifles good as new
- Listen!

01:03:19.197 --> 01:03:23.119
Listen everybody!

01:03:25.371 --> 01:03:28.541
Lamarque is dead.

01:03:31.794 --> 01:03:38.794
Lamarque is dead. Lamarque!
His death is the hour of fate

01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:48.660
The people's man.
His death is the sign we await

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.481
On his funeral day they will
honor his name

01:03:53.911 --> 01:03:56.086
It's a rallying cry that will
reach every ear

01:03:56.473 --> 01:03:58.991
In the death of Lamarque we
will kindle the flame

01:03:59.361 --> 01:04:01.483
They will see that the day of
salvation is near

01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:03.794
The time is hear

01:04:03.896 --> 01:04:07.766
Let us welcome it gladly with courage
and cheer. Let us take to the streets

01:04:08.229 --> 01:04:11.082
With no doubt in our hearts
But a jubilant shout

01:04:11.529 --> 01:04:18.529
They will come one and all
They will come when we call

01:04:26.649 --> 01:04:31.660
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:37.592
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!

01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:43.170
When the beating of your heart
Echos the beating of the drums

01:04:43.834 --> 01:04:48.989
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:55.101
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?

01:04:55.703 --> 01:05:00.748
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

01:05:01.538 --> 01:05:05.982
Then join in the fight
That will give you the right to be free!!

01:05:06.482 --> 01:05:11.371
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:16.935
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again

01:05:17.443 --> 01:05:22.394
When the beating of your heart
Echos the beating of the drums

01:05:22.926 --> 01:05:27.919
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:33.876
Will you give all you can give
So that our banner may advance

01:05:34.322 --> 01:05:39.326
Some will fall and some will live
Will you stand up and take your chance?

01:05:39.832 --> 01:05:44.232
The blood of the martyrs
Will water the meadows of France!

01:05:44.714 --> 01:05:49.947
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing a song of angry men?

01:05:50.412 --> 01:05:55.060
It is the music of a people
Who will not be slaves again!

01:05:55.524 --> 01:06:00.526
When the beating of your heart
Echos the beating of the drums

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:06.147
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes!

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:22.304
"The house's garden of Valjean
on rue Plumet"

01:06:37.189 --> 01:06:42.026
How strange, this feeling that
my life's begun at last

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:48.621
This change, can people really
fall in love so fast?

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:55.317
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
Have you been too much on your own?

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:03.460
So many things unclear
So many things unknown.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:15.590
In my life there are so many questions
and answers that somehow seem wrong

01:07:19.237 --> 01:07:26.237
In my life there are times when I catch
in the silence the sigh of a faraway song

01:07:27.814 --> 01:07:32.903
And it sings of a world
that I long to see

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:40.400
Out of reach, just a whisper
away waiting for me!

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:45.915
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?

01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:51.431
Does he see what I saw?
Does he feel what I feel?

01:07:52.952 --> 01:07:57.447
In my life I'm no
longer alone

01:07:57.954 --> 01:08:02.165
Now the love in my life
Is so near

01:08:03.797 --> 01:08:10.734
Find me now, find me here!

01:08:21.506 --> 01:08:28.506
In my life she has burst like the
music of angels, the light of the sun

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:37.203
And my life seems to stop as if something is
over and something has scarcely begun.

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:42.033
Eponine you're the friend who
has brought me here

01:08:42.428 --> 01:08:48.773
Thanks to you I am one with the
Gods and Heaven is near!

01:08:49.194 --> 01:08:53.680
And I soar through a world
that is new that is free

01:08:53.808 --> 01:08:58.254
Every word that he says
is a dagger in me!

01:08:59.086 --> 01:09:04.415
In my life there's been no one
like him anywhere

01:09:05.136 --> 01:09:12.136
Anywhere, where he is...
If he asked... I'd be his

01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:23.231
In my life there is someone
who touches my life

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:30.862
- Waiting near
- Waiting here

01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:58.071
A heart full of love
A heart full of song

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:06.176
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame

01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:12.376
I do not even know your name,
dear mademoiselle

01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:18.349
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

01:10:18.663 --> 01:10:25.663
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret

01:10:28.448 --> 01:10:34.120
- My name is Marius Pontmercy
- And mine's Cosette

01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:41.024
- Cosette, I don't know what to say
- Then make no sound

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.445
- I am lost
- I am found

01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:54.839
- A heart full of light
- A night bright as day

01:10:57.784 --> 01:11:03.260
And you must never go away
Cosette, Cosette

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:08.256
This is a chain we'll never break

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:17.006
- Do I dream?
- I'm awake

01:11:17.934 --> 01:11:23.822
- A heart full of love
- He was never mine to lose

01:11:24.311 --> 01:11:29.738
- A heart full of you
- Why regret what could not be?

01:11:31.268 --> 01:11:38.268
- A single look and then I knew
- These are words he'll never say

01:11:40.088 --> 01:11:43.425
- Not to me
- From today

01:11:43.837 --> 01:11:47.946
- Not for me
- Ev'ry day

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:56.056
His heart full of love
Not a dream after all

01:12:29.744 --> 01:12:36.744
"The Attack on Rue Plumet"

01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:39.799
This is his lair
I've seen the old fox around

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:42.268
He keeps himself to himself
He's staying close to the ground

01:12:42.594 --> 01:12:44.959
I smell profit here!

01:12:45.276 --> 01:12:47.290
Ten years ago, he came
and paid for Cosette

01:12:47.632 --> 01:12:49.575
I let her go for a song
It's time we settled the debt

01:12:49.938 --> 01:12:52.103
This'll cost him dear

01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:56.607
What do I care who you should rob
Give me my share, finish the job!

01:12:57.151 --> 01:12:59.316
You shut your mouth
Give me your hand

01:12:59.789 --> 01:13:02.970
- What have we here?
- Who is this hussy?

01:13:03.727 --> 01:13:07.922
It's your brat Eponine Don't you know your
own kid. Why's she hanging about you?

01:13:09.058 --> 01:13:14.817
'Ponine, get on home. You're not needed
in this. We're enough here without you

01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:20.336
I know this house. I tell you
there's nothing here for you

01:13:21.009 --> 01:13:26.914
Just the old man and the girl
They live ordinary lives

01:13:28.721 --> 01:13:32.073
Don't interfere. You've got some gall
Take care,young miss,you've got a lot to say!

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:34.773
- She's going soft
- Happens to all

01:13:35.185 --> 01:13:37.368
Go home, 'Ponine,
Go home, you're in the way

01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:40.112
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna warn
them here.

01:13:40.532 --> 01:13:42.716
One little scream and you'll
regret it for a year.

01:13:43.947 --> 01:13:47.429
What a palaver
What an absolute treat

01:13:47.781 --> 01:13:48.900
To watch a cat and it's father
pick a bone in the street

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.561
- Not a sound out of you!
- Well I told you I'd do it, told you I'd do it...

01:13:57.905 --> 01:14:02.197
You wait my girl, you'll rue this night
I'll make you scream, you'll scream all right

01:14:02.789 --> 01:14:07.896
Leave her to me, don't wait around
Make for the sewers, go underground!

01:14:07.971 --> 01:14:12.260
It was your cry sent them away
Once more 'Ponine saving the day

01:14:12.734 --> 01:14:16.303
Dearest Cosette, my friend 'Ponine
brought me to you, showed me the way!

01:14:16.739 --> 01:14:19.114
Someone is near

01:14:19.465 --> 01:14:24.771
Let's not be seen
Somebody's here...

01:14:27.913 --> 01:14:33.262
My God, Cosette I heard a cry in the dark
I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.

01:14:33.715 --> 01:14:40.037
That was my cry you heard, Papa.
I was afraid of what they'd do.

01:14:40.638 --> 01:14:44.438
They ran away when they heard my cry

01:14:44.603 --> 01:14:49.334
Cosette, my child, what will
become of you?

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:56.542
Three men I saw beyond the wall
Three men in shadow moving fast

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:06.194
This is a warning to us all
These are the shadows of the past

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:12.126
Must be Javert!
He's found my cover at last!

01:15:12.488 --> 01:15:14.628
I've got to get Cosette away
Before they return!

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:18.840
We must get away from shadows
They will never let us be

01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:22.433
Tomorrow to Calais
Then a ship across the sea!

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:27.447
Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say
no more. Tomorrow we'll away!

01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:33.268
Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close
another door and live another day!

01:15:57.489 --> 01:15:59.774
One day more

01:16:00.637 --> 01:16:03.722
Another day, another destiny

01:16:04.178 --> 01:16:08.219
This never ending road to Calvary

01:16:09.112 --> 01:16:12.815
These men who seem to know my crime
will surely come a second time

01:16:13.238 --> 01:16:17.434
- One day more...
- I did not live until today,

01:16:20.556 --> 01:16:27.556
- How can I live when we are parted?
- One day more!

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:35.334
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has started

01:16:42.956 --> 01:16:49.386
- One more day all on my own
- Will we ever meet again?

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:56.532
- One more day with him not caring
- I was born to be with you.

01:16:57.347 --> 01:17:03.811
- What a life I might have known
- And I swear I will be true!

01:17:04.293 --> 01:17:11.293
But he never saw me there

01:17:13.702 --> 01:17:19.921
- One more day before the storm!
- Do I follow where she goes

01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:25.964
- At the barricades of Freedom!
- Shall I join my brothers there!

01:17:26.374 --> 01:17:31.886
- When our ranks begin to form,
- Do I stay or do I dare?

01:17:32.005 --> 01:17:37.610
- Will you take your place with me?
- The time is now

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.143
The place is here

01:17:42.635 --> 01:17:46.240
- One day more!
- One more day till revolution,

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.378
We will nip it in the bud!

01:17:48.808 --> 01:17:53.664
I will join these little schoolboys.
They will wet themselves with blood!

01:17:54.852 --> 01:17:56.967
Watch'm run amuck,
Catch'm when they fall

01:17:57.329 --> 01:17:59.605
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:03.535
- Here a little pinch, there a little touch
- Most of them are goners

01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:08.426
- So they won't miss much!
- One day to a new beginning

01:18:08.468 --> 01:18:10.951
Raise the flag of freedom high!

01:18:11.445 --> 01:18:15.184
Every man will be a king

01:18:17.331 --> 01:18:21.300
There's a new world for the winning
There's a new world to be won

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:24.841
Do you hear the people sing?

01:18:25.252 --> 01:18:31.009
My place is here,
I fight with you!

01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:35.024
One day more!

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.352
Tomorrow is the judgement day.
The judgement day

01:18:54.825 --> 01:19:00.574
Tomorrow we'll discover what
our God in Heaven has in store

01:19:01.563 --> 01:19:06.962
One more dawn
One more day

01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:13.994
One day more

01:20:06.202 --> 01:20:10.959
