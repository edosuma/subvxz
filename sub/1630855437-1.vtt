It got rained out.

14:13.315 --> 14:14.400
[Alex] You're back.

14:14.483 --> 14:16.986
What's it been this time?

14:35.588 --> 14:38.883
So, Nick, are you here on,
uh, business or pleasure?

14:42.887 --> 14:45.931
Got a pretty big mouth to
go with your big brain, huh?

14:46.932 --> 14:48.142
Leave her alone, Nick.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.895
And it's "dad", not Nick.

14:50.978 --> 14:52.062
I am your father.

She may cater to your needs,
but we don't need anything from you.

15:10.998 --> 15:12.166
Better watch your mouth.

15:12.249 --> 15:14.793
Why don't you just take your shit
and get the fuck out?

15:14.877 --> 15:16.045

-Yeah.

15:16.128 --> 15:19.632

just go to bed, okay?

across the face.

He didn't mean to do that.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.702
No, he meant to hit me.

17:11.785 --> 17:13.787
No, he did not, but…

17:15.789 --> 17:18.250
did you really have to
push his buttons like that?

17:19.168 --> 17:21.795
Tell him to go. Please, we don't need him.

17:23.213 --> 17:24.757
I need my husband.

28:24.165 --> 28:26.626
-No way he jumped the falls.
-Vince!

28:26.709 --> 28:28.503
He better not be fucking around.

28:29.003 --> 28:30.004
Vince!

28:48.022 --> 28:49.357
-[Em] Vince!
-[Alex] Vince!

28:49.441 --> 28:50.692
[Jesse] Vince!

28:51.276 --> 28:53.194
Vince! You scared the shit out of me!

28:53.278 --> 28:54.821
Not fucking funny, man.

28:56.990 --> 28:57.991
Where are you going?

29:01.119 --> 29:02.537
[Alex] Oh, my God!

29:02.620 --> 29:04.789
[Jesse] Oh, nasty!

29:14.591 --> 29:16.384
I think it's recent,

29:16.468 --> 29:17.719
last night's storm maybe.

29:18.094 --> 29:20.221
No, no, no, no, no.
You do not wanna go in there.

29:22.682 --> 29:25.226
Yeah, we should call the cops
or tell the ranger.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.729
I mean, maybe no one even knows
this is out here.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.322
Normally, that's what
the transponder's for.

29:38.031 --> 29:39.491
[switch clicking]

29:39.574 --> 29:41.409
No. No power.

29:42.494 --> 29:43.495
Shit.

29:45.371 --> 29:47.791
-[phone camera chimes]
-Em, what are you doing?

29:47.874 --> 29:49.501
Just in case someone asks.

29:49.584 --> 29:51.211
It's morbid. He's dead.

29:51.294 --> 29:52.629
[Em] Okay, geez.

29:53.421 --> 29:55.298
Vince, man,
maybe you should get out of there.

29:55.381 --> 29:57.467
I don't think we oughta
be touching any of this.

29:58.134 --> 29:59.302
[Vince] Fuck you.

29:59.385 --> 30:01.971
[Jesse] I'm serious, man.
We gotta go tell the ranger.

30:02.055 --> 30:03.807
Yeah, this doesn't feel right.

30:03.890 --> 30:05.308
[Em] You think there's a reward?

30:07.018 --> 30:07.894
[gasps]

30:11.397 --> 30:12.649
Motherfucker.

30:18.613 --> 30:20.615
[Em] Is that… cocaine?

30:22.158 --> 30:23.952
Only one way to know for sure.

30:25.078 --> 30:26.329
[Alex] What are you doing?

30:26.412 --> 30:27.831
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

30:27.914 --> 30:30.834
So many fucking reasons that should be
obvious to a normal human being.

30:31.876 --> 30:34.128
Let's all just relax, okay? Alex is right.

30:34.212 --> 30:35.421
We can't touch this.

30:35.505 --> 30:38.424
Do you have any idea how much
one of these bricks are worth?

30:38.508 --> 30:40.218
Enough to put each of us
away for a decade.

30:40.301 --> 30:42.303
-[Vince] Do you see cops?
-We're not drug dealers.

30:42.387 --> 30:45.682
And what about the dead body?
I mean, that's a human being.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.101
We'll make an anonymous call later.

30:48.184 --> 30:49.227
Check it! This…

30:49.310 --> 30:51.813
This could set us up
for a real fucking long time.

30:51.896 --> 30:53.606
It could literally change our lives.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.025
Em, you're not actually considering this?

30:57.068 --> 30:59.571
Not all of us are going away
to some fancy school.

31:03.324 --> 31:04.409
School?

31:04.492 --> 31:07.036
-What's she talking about?
-[Vince] She didn't tell you?

31:09.122 --> 31:12.250
She's leaving you, dude,
for some rich-ass college.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.044
Is this for real?

31:16.170 --> 31:17.046
No.

31:17.130 --> 31:19.340
I mean, it's not for sure.

31:19.924 --> 31:22.552
'Cause that's why I didn't tell you.
Without the scholarship…

31:22.635 --> 31:23.928
[laughs] You can afford it now.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.513
-[Em] If we were to do this--
-Em!

31:25.930 --> 31:27.307
Was I talking to you?

31:27.932 --> 31:28.850
How do we sell it?

31:30.518 --> 31:33.396
Uh, Jesse's got a weed guy,
for sure there's a connection there.

31:33.479 --> 31:35.982
-No, leave me outta this.
-[Vince] You work at a casino.

31:38.818 --> 31:40.737
And then there's always Alex's daddy.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.071
Oh, do you want me to text him?

31:42.155 --> 31:44.198
Or take a sample home
for Sunday night dinner?

31:44.282 --> 31:46.034
You're all crazy! I'm going to the cops.

31:46.117 --> 31:48.703
If you do, I'll tell them
he was the one who put us up to it.

31:48.786 --> 31:49.746
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

31:49.829 --> 31:51.122
What happens when he finds out?

31:51.205 --> 31:52.707
Hey, man, back off, okay?

31:52.790 --> 31:54.792
-Just give me--
-I said back the fuck up!

31:56.002 --> 31:57.086
I'm taking mine!

31:57.170 --> 31:59.589
If you call the cops,
I'll tell 'em about her daddy,

31:59.672 --> 32:02.926
so they'll have to investigate
and puts her family under the microscope.

32:03.009 --> 32:05.720
-You're a fucking asshole!
-So you keep telling me!

32:06.763 --> 32:08.097
Em, take her backpack.

32:10.475 --> 32:11.434
We get outta here,

32:11.517 --> 32:13.811
we go our separate ways.
You forget you know us.

32:16.272 --> 32:17.523
No problem there.

32:53.226 --> 32:54.310
[Vince] Go on.

32:55.353 --> 32:57.313
-Ninety-nine.
-[Em laughs]

32:57.397 --> 32:58.231
[Vince] A hundred.

32:58.314 --> 33:00.608
[Em] A hundred and one. No? Okay.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.153
[Vince grunts and laughs]

33:15.581 --> 33:17.166
[Vince] Hey, baldy.

33:18.209 --> 33:19.252
That's our car.

33:24.007 --> 33:25.967
[Cutter] You kids are out pretty far.

33:27.427 --> 33:31.180
No one else around for… miles.

33:33.891 --> 33:35.101
We were hiking.

33:38.187 --> 33:40.189
Swimming, too, by the looks of it.

33:41.190 --> 33:42.066
Tell me,

33:42.859 --> 33:47.280
what is so interesting… up over that hill?

33:51.242 --> 33:52.160
A waterfall.

33:52.243 --> 33:55.038
[gasps mockingly] Beautiful. Mm.

33:56.414 --> 33:57.373
That all?

33:57.790 --> 34:00.001
-Yeah.
-[Cutter] Nothing else?

34:01.210 --> 34:02.086
More trees?

34:03.129 --> 34:07.050
Look, buddy, we're on our way back
to the ranger station, so, uh,

34:07.133 --> 34:08.634
could you get off our car?

34:13.681 --> 34:15.224
[Cutter sighs]

34:22.940 --> 34:24.192
[engine starts]

34:24.942 --> 34:26.152
[sighs]

34:30.323 --> 34:32.116
[Vince] Fucking keep your mouth shut.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.327
-[taps on window]
-[Cutter] Get the fuck out.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.459
[Jesse] Come on.

34:41.542 --> 34:44.337
We know we're in a restricted area,
we're sorry.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.422
-If there's a fine--
-Shut the fuck up.

34:47.799 --> 34:48.925
[sighs deeply]

34:55.139 --> 34:56.933
Jerry. You wanna come in?

34:57.975 --> 35:00.186
[Jerry over radio]
What's up, Cutter? Where you at?

35:00.269 --> 35:02.522
I'm up on that logging road.

35:02.605 --> 35:03.773
North of the pass.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.317
Found a couple of kids.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.570
Say they've been hiking near Migizi Falls.

35:10.154 --> 35:13.407
[Jerry] Yeah. I been searching
up and down that river like twice.

35:13.991 --> 35:15.952
Well, maybe you missed something, Jerry,

35:16.035 --> 35:19.580
because these kids
know more than they're saying.

35:21.040 --> 35:23.167
[Jerry] Yeah, all right.
I'll be there in ten.

35:24.085 --> 35:25.086
Copy that.

35:26.295 --> 35:27.421
[clears throat]

35:29.924 --> 35:31.008
What's in the pack?

35:31.968 --> 35:33.886
-Camping gear.
-Uh-oh.

35:34.846 --> 35:36.430
You said you were hiking.

35:37.932 --> 35:39.183
Hiking and camping.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.935
Look, we don't want any trouble.

35:41.018 --> 35:42.436
Honest, we were just hiking and--

35:42.520 --> 35:45.523
How 'bout you cut the shit, thank you,

35:45.606 --> 35:47.984
and you open the fucking bag.

35:48.067 --> 35:49.110
How 'bout that?

35:58.494 --> 36:00.329
What's the matter, sugar?

36:02.623 --> 36:03.541
You scared?

36:06.085 --> 36:07.628
What are you scared of?

36:09.172 --> 36:10.173
Come here.

36:10.256 --> 36:11.382
Leave her alone.

36:14.969 --> 36:17.054
You weren't here to hike, were you?

36:18.764 --> 36:20.308
Get the fuck away from her.

36:21.517 --> 36:23.561
-[gun clicks]
-Vince, what are you doing?

36:27.773 --> 36:29.275
Kid, I gotta hand it to you.

36:30.610 --> 36:34.155
I've had a lot of guns pointed at me
in my life, but… [clicks tongue]

36:34.238 --> 36:35.323
…never a flare gun.

36:35.907 --> 36:36.991
Congrats.

36:37.617 --> 36:40.203
How about you put that fucking
thing down before someone--

36:40.286 --> 36:41.913
[both guns fire]

36:52.548 --> 36:53.674
[Jesse grunts]

36:54.508 --> 36:56.719
-You have to hit him again.
-[Jesse grunts]

36:58.012 --> 36:59.931
We gotta go. Now!

37:00.306 --> 37:01.974
Em, come on.

37:03.517 --> 37:06.062
We can't help him now. Get in. Go!

37:12.443 --> 37:14.403
I just smashed a man's skull with a rock.

37:14.487 --> 37:15.947
[Alex] Jesse, you saved us, okay?

37:30.836 --> 37:32.505
[Em] Do you know where we're going?

37:32.588 --> 37:33.923
[Alex] The road we came from.

37:34.006 --> 37:35.841
[Jesse] Is anybody even listening to me?

37:35.925 --> 37:38.261
-I just smashed a man's skull.
-You saved us.

37:38.344 --> 37:40.263
We have to go back.
What if Vince is just hurt?

37:40.346 --> 37:41.639
[Alex] We saw him get shot.

37:41.722 --> 37:43.057
-He's dead.
-Alex, slow down.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.976
-[Em] Don't say that!
-[Jesse] Slow down.

37:45.059 --> 37:46.519
-[Jesse] Look out!
-[Em screams]

37:46.602 --> 37:47.937
[crashing]

37:53.234 --> 37:56.237
[Jesse screaming]

38:10.167 --> 38:13.296
[Jesse] Fuck, my leg. Ah, shit.

38:13.379 --> 38:14.839
Fuck. [groans]

38:17.383 --> 38:19.760
Em? Em? Emily!

38:20.553 --> 38:21.595
I'm fine.

38:22.638 --> 38:25.349
-Hang on.
-[Jesse breathing heavily]

38:46.454 --> 38:47.496
[coughing]

38:53.419 --> 38:54.920
[Alex] Okay. Easy.

38:57.214 --> 38:59.342
Okay, show me your leg. Can you move it?

39:00.092 --> 39:01.886
It's okay. Just breathe.

39:02.345 --> 39:03.471
[Jesse] Is it bad?

39:03.554 --> 39:05.056
Looks fucking bad.

39:05.139 --> 39:08.059
No, you're gonna be okay. Just stay there.

39:12.521 --> 39:13.522
[tearing fabric]

39:16.484 --> 39:17.401
Hold still.

39:19.737 --> 39:21.614
Okay. Gonna hurt a little bit.

39:21.697 --> 39:23.574
-[groans]
-[Alex] Sorry.

39:26.118 --> 39:28.579
-[Em coughing]
-Em, are you okay?

39:28.954 --> 39:30.414
Do I look fucking okay?

39:30.915 --> 39:31.957
Look at me.

39:33.667 --> 39:34.627
[Alex] Okay.

39:38.005 --> 39:39.215
How's the car?

39:46.305 --> 39:47.390
[Alex] Um…

39:47.932 --> 39:48.891
Hold on.

39:55.189 --> 39:57.233
[static buzzing over radio]

40:04.782 --> 40:07.785
[Cutter over radio]
Jerry? Jerry, wanna call back?

40:08.828 --> 40:10.079
Jerry?

40:10.162 --> 40:11.247
Murph?

40:11.997 --> 40:13.916
Fuck. Someone fucking answer.

40:19.422 --> 40:22.133
[Murph over radio]
Cutter, it's Murph. I heard gunshots.

40:22.633 --> 40:26.387
[Cutter] One of those little fuckers
took a pop at me and fucked off.

40:26.762 --> 40:29.807
They know where the plane is.
I found a couple bricks.

40:32.309 --> 40:33.853
Anything from Jerry?

40:34.728 --> 40:36.272
[Murph] Nothing.

40:36.856 --> 40:40.484
[Cutter] He should've cut them off at
the bottom of the logging road by now.

40:41.068 --> 40:44.613
[Murph] I'm still at the clearing.
You want I should go check it out?

40:44.697 --> 40:47.575
[Cutter] No. I'll head down
and see what's going on

40:47.658 --> 40:49.452
as soon as I can see straight.

40:50.953 --> 40:52.913
Guys, we have to go on foot.
Can you stand?

40:53.539 --> 40:55.666
-What about the pick-up?
-[Alex] It's trashed.

40:55.749 --> 40:57.460
Can't you fix it? Isn't that what you do?

40:57.543 --> 40:58.961
There's no time! Didn't you hear?

40:59.044 --> 41:00.254
[Jesse] Wait. The radio.

41:00.337 --> 41:03.090
Maybe I can get
a emergency channel or something.

41:07.011 --> 41:08.971
Mayday. Mayday. Anyone there?

41:11.348 --> 41:13.851
-Mayday. Mayday.
-Jesse, we need to get off the main road.

41:13.934 --> 41:15.811
And go where?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

41:15.895 --> 41:18.230
We can't stay here
and wait for that maniac to show up.

41:18.314 --> 41:20.691
Alex is right. We gotta keep moving.

41:22.526 --> 41:23.569
Okay.

41:23.652 --> 41:25.321
[Alex grunts] Okay.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.830
[birds chirping]

41:37.708 --> 41:39.210
[Jesse groans]

41:39.293 --> 41:41.670
We gotta keep going. Come on.

41:43.214 --> 41:45.341
[Jesse groans] I can't, please.

41:45.424 --> 41:46.675
[Alex] Okay, okay.

41:47.593 --> 41:48.552
Sorry.

41:49.094 --> 41:51.430
Okay, my leg's numb. I think it's broken.

41:51.514 --> 41:53.641
Let's not worry
about that right now, okay?

41:53.724 --> 41:56.310
[breathing heavily]

41:56.393 --> 41:57.353
How bad?

41:58.103 --> 41:59.104
[Alex] It's… it's bad.

42:11.617 --> 42:12.993
All right. Keep still.

42:16.539 --> 42:17.540
[whimpers]

42:18.290 --> 42:20.334
All right. That should help, okay?

42:20.417 --> 42:22.753
-We gotta go.
-[stammers] I just need a second.

42:22.836 --> 42:25.714
-We're never gonna make it out.
-We'll make it.

42:25.798 --> 42:27.675
Em's right.
You guys should go on without me.

42:27.758 --> 42:30.511
-We're not leaving you.
-You mean like we left Vince?

42:30.594 --> 42:33.305
-That was way different, okay?
-[Jesse] It doesn't matter!

42:33.389 --> 42:36.058
You guys need to find the ranger
and bring him back here.

42:36.141 --> 42:37.851
We don't even know where here is.

42:37.935 --> 42:39.520
Vince was the one fucking driving!

42:40.563 --> 42:43.148
The map! The map! Where's the map?

42:43.232 --> 42:44.692
Vince had it in his backpack.

42:47.069 --> 42:50.030
I ditched the bags when we ran.
They're still back there.

42:50.114 --> 42:51.156
Ah, shit!

42:52.283 --> 42:53.492
It's not far, okay?

42:53.576 --> 42:55.536
I can run and be back in like 20 minutes.

42:55.619 --> 42:57.663
Okay. Okay, go. Em and I will wait here.

42:57.746 --> 43:00.749
Just whistle or something
in case you don't see us.

43:01.542 --> 43:03.294
No, no, no! Just go!

43:22.438 --> 43:23.647
[softly] Vince?

43:25.899 --> 43:26.942
Vince.

43:29.486 --> 43:30.446
Vince.

44:01.268 --> 44:02.519
[phone line ringing]

44:02.603 --> 44:04.396
[operator] Police, fire or ambulance?

44:04.480 --> 44:06.899
Police. Hi. Yeah, I need help.
I'm in Garden Valley.

44:06.982 --> 44:08.233
[phone line beeps]

44:09.234 --> 44:10.069
Fuck.

44:28.170 --> 44:29.088
Hello?

44:29.672 --> 44:30.631
Hello?

44:36.887 --> 44:37.888
Ah!

44:41.934 --> 44:44.061
Climb down, or I start taking shots.

44:45.854 --> 44:48.107
I got more ammo than time.
It's your choice.

44:50.192 --> 44:52.611
Fine. Have it your way.

44:52.694 --> 44:54.238
No, um, all right.

44:54.822 --> 44:58.075
Don't shoot. I'm coming down, okay?

44:58.158 --> 44:59.368
Smart girl.

45:04.415 --> 45:05.833
We were just hiking. I swear.

45:05.916 --> 45:08.293
Bullshit, we know you know
where the plane is.

45:08.377 --> 45:10.087
Yes, but we found it by accident.

45:10.170 --> 45:12.089
We really only came to hike the falls.

45:13.966 --> 45:15.134
All right.

45:15.217 --> 45:16.427
That's better.

45:17.386 --> 45:19.388
Now, uh, which one are you?

45:20.806 --> 45:22.850
-Your name?
-Alex.

45:23.434 --> 45:24.726
Okay, Alex.

45:25.352 --> 45:28.605
You're gonna take me to that plane,
and in return,

45:28.689 --> 45:30.399
I'm gonna let you live. You understand?

45:31.733 --> 45:33.569
I need you to say it out loud.

45:33.652 --> 45:36.905
I'll take you to the crash site.
Just, please don't hurt me.

45:37.656 --> 45:39.074
That's up to you.

45:39.158 --> 45:40.033
How far is it?

45:41.618 --> 45:43.120
Uh, it's close.

45:44.997 --> 45:45.914
All right.

45:46.707 --> 45:47.791
Start walking.

45:59.595 --> 46:01.680
[Cutter over radio]
Murph, they killed Jerry.

46:01.763 --> 46:04.475
-Looks like they ran off the road.
-Jesus.

46:04.558 --> 46:06.643
All right, I'm here with one of the girls.

46:06.727 --> 46:09.229
-She's taking me to the plane now.
-[Cutter] Good.

46:09.313 --> 46:11.356
Radio me your location
as soon as you're there,

46:11.440 --> 46:14.610
and no loose ends, you hear me?

46:17.154 --> 46:19.781
Cutter, they're just kids, you know?

46:19.865 --> 46:22.951
[Cutter] Well, they saw our faces
so they don't leave this forest.

46:23.035 --> 46:24.369
Is that clear?

46:25.829 --> 46:26.747
Murph?

46:26.830 --> 46:28.832
Yeah. Copy that. Murph out.

46:29.458 --> 46:30.501
Move.

46:52.898 --> 46:54.358
I don't see a plane.

46:55.359 --> 46:57.653
Hey! Better not be fucking around here.

46:57.736 --> 46:59.738
Down there. It's around a sandbank.

47:09.706 --> 47:11.208
I think you're lying!

47:13.627 --> 47:15.963
I swear. That's how we found it.
I don't know another way.

47:16.797 --> 47:18.549
Well, how do you get down?

47:19.841 --> 47:20.717
Is there a path?

47:37.359 --> 47:38.902
What the fuck!

47:56.461 --> 47:59.881
Cutter, that crazy bitch
just jumped the falls.

47:59.965 --> 48:01.216
[Cutter] Are you at the plane?

48:01.300 --> 48:03.927
No, no, no, she was gonna
take me to the plane,

48:04.011 --> 48:06.388
and then she jumped the fucking falls!

48:06.471 --> 48:08.765
[Cutter] How 'bout you get
the fuck after her?

48:08.849 --> 48:10.100
Get after her.

48:10.517 --> 48:11.727
Get after her.

48:12.436 --> 48:13.437
Okay.

48:19.818 --> 48:21.236
Fuck that! Hell no!

48:37.961 --> 48:40.255
[gasps, coughs]

48:49.097 --> 48:52.351
[coughing]

49:29.846 --> 49:30.681
[coughing]

49:33.475 --> 49:34.476
[Murph] Hey!

49:35.227 --> 49:37.104
Hey! You trying to get yourself killed?

49:37.729 --> 49:38.814
You gonna shoot me?

49:39.690 --> 49:41.149
I don't see a plane!

49:45.153 --> 49:46.029
Do it!

49:47.072 --> 49:48.407
[gun cocks]

49:58.959 --> 49:59.876
Fuck!

50:10.262 --> 50:11.138
[exhales sharply]

50:14.766 --> 50:15.642
Cutter.

50:17.060 --> 50:19.396
The current's too strong.
She must have drowned.

50:20.689 --> 50:22.190
What about the plane?

50:22.274 --> 50:24.151
[Murph] Still no sign of it.

50:25.902 --> 50:29.114
Well, I've got the other two, so…

50:30.574 --> 50:32.200
we'll know soon enough.

50:32.659 --> 50:33.744
Copy that.

50:36.204 --> 50:37.664
They aren't going…

50:39.416 --> 50:40.417
anywhere.

50:42.043 --> 50:44.337
[groaning in pain]

50:51.136 --> 50:53.013
[humming]

51:05.108 --> 51:06.485
Need a little haircut?

51:06.860 --> 51:07.736
Just one or two?

51:11.156 --> 51:12.949
What about you, huh?

51:13.033 --> 51:14.284
Just a hair or two.

51:16.369 --> 51:17.287
Maybe.

51:18.413 --> 51:19.664
[Cutter chuckles]

51:22.876 --> 51:24.127
[Cutter humming]

51:50.362 --> 51:52.781
[screams]

52:01.456 --> 52:03.250
[panting]

52:36.157 --> 52:37.492
[leaves rustling]

52:44.916 --> 52:46.668
-You're alive.
-Yeah.

52:47.502 --> 52:48.962
No thanks to any of you.

52:49.045 --> 52:51.047
But we looked for you.

52:51.631 --> 52:53.508
Hmm, I bet you looked real fucking hard.

52:53.925 --> 52:55.135
Where's Em And Jesse?

52:55.218 --> 52:57.178
Jesse hit that asshole with a rock,

52:57.262 --> 52:59.556
which only pissed him off, so we took off.

52:59.931 --> 53:02.100
[scoffs] Got real far I see.

53:02.183 --> 53:05.687
Jesse and Em are hiding down the road,
but I went back to get the map

53:05.770 --> 53:07.230
and I ran into another one of them.

53:07.314 --> 53:10.191
Oh, the map's gone,
along with everything else.

53:11.109 --> 53:12.152
How'd you get away?

53:12.694 --> 53:13.778
I jumped the falls.

53:15.572 --> 53:16.489
Like for real?

53:17.282 --> 53:20.201
-Like, like from the top top?
-Yeah.

53:20.785 --> 53:22.162
[laughs]

53:22.245 --> 53:23.997
You're fucking crazy.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.582
Oh. Ow. Fuck.

53:26.625 --> 53:29.127
Look, they're probably looking for me, so…

53:32.839 --> 53:35.842
Oh. You know, a please
or a thank you would be nice.

53:35.926 --> 53:38.678
-You're such a dick.
-Love you, too.

53:40.305 --> 53:41.640
[Vince groans softly]

53:59.824 --> 54:00.659
Jesus!

54:02.535 --> 54:04.079
A little warning next time.

54:04.746 --> 54:06.831
Next dead body, promise.

54:08.124 --> 54:09.250
[Vince] Who are you?

54:13.463 --> 54:14.547
That should hold.

54:19.135 --> 54:21.096
What are you doing? Give me the keys.

54:21.179 --> 54:22.973
[scoffs] Dream on, gimp.

54:31.439 --> 54:32.983
[engine starts]

54:37.946 --> 54:40.573
[birds chirping]

54:50.959 --> 54:52.377
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

54:52.460 --> 54:54.337
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

54:54.421 --> 54:56.464
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

54:56.548 --> 54:58.091
An opportunity for free drugs?

54:58.174 --> 54:59.509
World doesn't work like that.

54:59.592 --> 55:01.386
Yeah, well, my world
doesn't work your way.

55:01.469 --> 55:03.263
At least you have options. Me, I'm…

55:04.222 --> 55:06.224
I'm another fucking
Danny Hagel waiting to happen.

55:06.307 --> 55:07.600
That's not true.

55:08.643 --> 55:11.354
-You really need to talk to Em.
-About what?

55:11.438 --> 55:13.231
Whoa. Look.

55:18.194 --> 55:19.612
Oh, fuck.

55:19.696 --> 55:20.572
Yes!

55:21.156 --> 55:23.158
[indistinct radio chatter]

55:25.827 --> 55:27.579
Thank God you're here.
There are these guys.

55:27.662 --> 55:30.457
They have guns. They're after us.
They're drug runners or something.

55:30.540 --> 55:32.208
Whoa, slow down. Slowly.

55:32.292 --> 55:33.585
We heard the gunshots.

55:33.668 --> 55:35.587
We've already got patrols in the area.

55:35.670 --> 55:36.838
You're safe.

55:36.921 --> 55:38.089
What about Em and Jesse?

55:38.173 --> 55:39.215
Yeah, they're our friends.

55:39.299 --> 55:41.009
Emily and Jesse. Yeah, we know.

55:41.092 --> 55:42.761
We picked them up a while back.

55:42.844 --> 55:44.721
Yeah, we got them at the ranger station.

55:44.804 --> 55:46.347
They're getting all patched up.

55:47.223 --> 55:48.850
Come on. I'll take you to them.

55:48.933 --> 55:50.560
I think you need a call for back up,

55:50.643 --> 55:51.895
'cause these guys are killers.

55:51.978 --> 55:53.938
We saw three of them,
but there could be more.

55:54.022 --> 55:55.565
Oh, okay.

55:55.648 --> 55:56.649
Hold on.

55:58.318 --> 56:00.320
Yeah, I got the other two.

56:00.403 --> 56:03.531
I'll contact you from
the ranger station. Over.

56:03.615 --> 56:05.366
Copy that. Over.

56:09.454 --> 56:11.831
You think you'd be able to…

56:11.915 --> 56:13.666
describe these guys if you saw 'em?

56:13.750 --> 56:14.667
Absolutely.

56:14.751 --> 56:16.461
-One guy had some, uh--
-[gun cocks]

56:19.714 --> 56:20.715
[Alex grunts]

56:54.833 --> 56:55.834
[Skip sighs]

56:57.085 --> 57:00.296
-Come on, rise and shine.
-[groans softly]

57:02.465 --> 57:03.466
There she is.

57:08.096 --> 57:09.139
You ready to talk?

57:10.181 --> 57:11.224
Where am I?

57:15.103 --> 57:16.146
[Skip] You're alive.

57:19.274 --> 57:21.276
Whether you stay that way is up to you.

57:21.734 --> 57:22.944
My friends?

57:23.653 --> 57:24.737
Where are my friends?

57:28.867 --> 57:32.662
Cutter, missy here wants proof of life.

57:33.246 --> 57:34.539
[Cutter over radio] Copy that.

57:34.622 --> 57:36.374
-[Jesse groans]
-Stop.

57:36.458 --> 57:38.501
-[Jesse and Em screaming]
-Stop.

57:39.419 --> 57:40.587
Stop!

57:40.670 --> 57:42.088
Where's my plane, Alex?

57:49.304 --> 57:50.180
Fine.

57:51.389 --> 57:53.183
-I'll tell you.
-No, you'll take me.

57:54.267 --> 57:56.519
And this time, we'll stay on dry land.

57:57.770 --> 57:59.022
[motorcycle approaching]

58:04.527 --> 58:08.031
You make one sound,

58:08.114 --> 58:11.034
I'll take one life.

58:13.119 --> 58:14.412
We clear?

58:15.705 --> 58:17.040
Crystal.

58:37.602 --> 58:40.063
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

58:45.693 --> 58:48.446
[man over radio] We're looking at
a lot of mudslides up there.

58:48.530 --> 58:49.948
If you're coming up from the north,

58:50.031 --> 58:52.408
I'd say you're looking
at a lot of detours.

58:52.492 --> 58:54.619
And it's best to stay clear.

58:56.246 --> 58:57.497
[gun cocks]

59:09.717 --> 59:10.885
[Skip] Hi there.

59:12.136 --> 59:14.514
If you're looking for a day pass,
you're outta luck.

59:14.597 --> 59:18.309
Park's closed for maintenance
on account of last night's storm.

59:19.102 --> 59:20.728
I'm not here to sightsee.

59:21.437 --> 59:23.690
[Skip] Well, then,
what can I help you with?

59:27.318 --> 59:28.611
I'm looking for Skip.

59:29.070 --> 59:30.530
Hmm. [sucks teeth]

59:30.613 --> 59:32.156
Don't know no Skip.

59:32.657 --> 59:34.200
Something I can help you with?

59:37.453 --> 59:38.705
Sir?

59:42.458 --> 59:45.336
I was told I'd find Skip
at the ranger station.

59:46.087 --> 59:47.755
Well, like I said,

59:47.839 --> 59:51.217
nobody's been by all day
on account of last night's storm.

59:51.301 --> 59:53.094
Trails are pretty washed out.

59:56.097 --> 59:58.891
-Is that right?
-[Skip] Afraid so.

01:00:02.312 --> 01:00:05.231
But if your friend Skip shows up,

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:07.317
I'd be happy to give her a message.

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:13.114
I never said Skip was a her.

01:00:15.491 --> 01:00:17.744
-Lucky guess.
-Yeah.

01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:19.996
Hands on the counter, now.

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:22.248
Okay, we don't keep any money here.

01:00:22.332 --> 01:00:23.875
Shut the hell up.

01:00:28.338 --> 01:00:29.797
[clattering]

01:00:31.883 --> 01:00:33.176
[gunshot]

01:00:33.259 --> 01:00:35.678
You bitch. [groans]

01:00:42.477 --> 01:00:43.728
[gunshot]

01:00:48.316 --> 01:00:49.817
That's on you.

01:00:53.196 --> 01:00:54.405
Nolan, come in.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.326
[Nolan over radio]
Been waiting on you. What's the hold up?

01:00:59.202 --> 01:01:00.870
Bit of a complication.

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:03.956
You stay put. I'm coming to you.

01:01:12.465 --> 01:01:14.425
You had to be a rebel, huh?

01:01:18.179 --> 01:01:19.472
We're going for a ride.

01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:37.990
[Skip grunts frustratedly]

01:01:40.785 --> 01:01:41.786
Keep moving.

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:43.413
You're so fucked.

01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:15.224
What's the matter, sweetie?

01:15:15.307 --> 01:15:17.476
You afraid of the big bad wolf, huh?

01:15:17.559 --> 01:15:19.186
Come near me and I kill you!

01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:21.688
Where's Murph?

01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:23.315
He's off taking a piss.

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:26.985
Nolan'll go with you.

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:31.740
[over radio] As soon as he sees the plane,
I'll let the others go.

01:15:32.324 --> 01:15:35.661
Are you seriously gonna let a fucking kid
call the shots like this?

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:38.622
Cutter, shut the fuck up.

01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:42.376
That wasn't the deal.

01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:46.046
[Skip] The best one you're gonna get.

01:15:48.882 --> 01:15:50.425
Put Jesse on the radio.

01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:00.561
Alex, you okay?

01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:03.146
As soon as you can,
you get the hell out of there.

01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:04.523
Do you understand me?

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.233
I'm… I'm not leaving you.

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:08.402
Just do it.

01:16:09.444 --> 01:16:11.363
[over radio] I'll take the other guy.

01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:50.277
Goddamn.

01:16:50.986 --> 01:16:52.362
[Alex] I kept up my end.

01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:54.406
Tell Skip to let them go.

01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:56.199
Not just yet.

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.133
Now, start tossing out bags.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.720
I'm not playing around here.

01:17:29.608 --> 01:17:30.484
Drop it.

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.665
Backstabbing little rat.

01:17:45.749 --> 01:17:47.334
That's a compliment, coming from you.

01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:51.505
[Jesse breathing heavily]

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:54.257
This is taking too long.

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:55.676
Nolan?

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:57.094
Nolan, what's the hold up?

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.433
Skip, she's got it.

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:06.853
-She's gonna burn it.
-[Nolan groans]

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:08.480
[Skip over radio] Nolan?

01:18:10.857 --> 01:18:13.443
You're not the only one
who likes to play with matches.

01:18:14.486 --> 01:18:15.862
[mutters] Little bitch.

01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:18.031
[Alex] You touch Jesse or Em…

01:18:18.573 --> 01:18:21.159
and I burn it. All of it.

01:18:26.289 --> 01:18:27.499
Let them go.

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:33.422
What the hell you talking about?

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:34.673
We don't need 'em,

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.175
besides they won't get far.

01:18:41.388 --> 01:18:42.514
You heard her.

01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:44.099
Let's go!

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.977
Get the fuck out. Come on!

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:52.733
Be seeing you real soon.

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.111
All right, they're gone.
Put my guy back on.

01:18:56.194 --> 01:18:58.196
[Nolan] The plane's
at the bottom of the falls,

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.866
about 40 yards in behind a hidden bend.

01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:02.451
[fire crackling]

01:19:04.035 --> 01:19:06.788
Follow the logging road
till you come to your jeep.

01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:08.373
[Nolan groans]

01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:12.836
Hey Skip, I'd hurry if I were you.

01:19:33.106 --> 01:19:34.983
[engine starts]

01:19:45.786 --> 01:19:48.371
I just… I just need a second. [groans]

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.751
Alex, are you there?

01:19:55.796 --> 01:19:58.882
[over radio] We're on the logging road.
Jesse's hurt really bad.

01:19:58.965 --> 01:20:01.384
I don't know how much further
we can make it.

01:20:11.853 --> 01:20:12.854
Em, I'm here.

01:20:13.313 --> 01:20:14.314
Thank God.

01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:17.818
[Alex] About Vince, um…

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:19.694
What? You're sorry?

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.535
Stay where you are, okay?
I'm gonna… I'm gonna find you.

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:29.704
-Come on.
-Okay. Okay.

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:38.046
[exhales heavily]

01:21:06.575 --> 01:21:07.701
We're here.

01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.247
This better not be some
kind of fucking trick.

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.707
-[gunshot]
-[Skip gasps]

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.501
[Alex over radio] Might wanna tell
your boy to keep still.

01:21:16.835 --> 01:21:18.628
Murph found that out the hard way.

01:21:23.884 --> 01:21:25.093
Don't move, Cutter.

01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:32.934
Just stay put.

01:21:34.185 --> 01:21:35.979
She can't cover us both.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.966
Smart ass.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:06.551
-[Murph whistles]
-[Skip groans]

01:22:20.982 --> 01:22:21.858
Drop it.

01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:28.698
[chuckles]

01:22:30.575 --> 01:22:32.661
You're a tough little cunt, aren't ya?

01:22:37.874 --> 01:22:38.959
Probably not tough--

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:40.210
[Cutter groans]

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:44.798
You should probably stay off of that.

01:22:51.972 --> 01:22:53.139
Good for you, kid.

01:22:55.642 --> 01:22:56.768
Are you gonna finish me?

01:22:57.727 --> 01:22:58.812
Think I just did.

01:23:07.404 --> 01:23:08.321
Bam.

01:23:08.405 --> 01:23:09.489
[Cutter] You fucker!

01:23:10.573 --> 01:23:12.575
Oh, you fucking son of a bitch!

01:23:16.621 --> 01:23:17.580
Fuck!

01:23:18.665 --> 01:23:20.250
Let's go get Jesse and Em.

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.585
[Murph] Don't worry.
They can't be too far.

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:24.879
You get what I asked for?

01:23:28.174 --> 01:23:29.467
[engine starts]

01:23:55.994 --> 01:23:57.829
[Murph] Shit. Fuck.

01:24:10.925 --> 01:24:12.260
Both of you. Out.

01:24:16.514 --> 01:24:18.308
Uh-uh! No!

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:31.821
Hi, Dad.

01:24:33.406 --> 01:24:34.365
Hello.

01:24:37.368 --> 01:24:38.244
[chuckles]

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:41.081
These belong to you?

01:24:44.542 --> 01:24:45.418
Let them go.

01:24:45.919 --> 01:24:47.962
Hmm, thought we were negotiating here.

01:24:50.173 --> 01:24:53.384
Your drugs and the others are waiting
for you about a quarter mile back.

01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:54.636
Just follow the smoke.

01:24:58.389 --> 01:24:59.724
Hmm. And him?

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:01.559
He helped me out.

01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:03.728
I'm alive because of him.

01:25:04.854 --> 01:25:05.772
No.

01:25:07.649 --> 01:25:08.900
No, little girl,

01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:12.320
you're alive because of me.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.491
You know, I put up with a lot of shit
growing up, but I'm done.

01:25:16.574 --> 01:25:18.701
-Watch it.
-[Alex] Why? You gonna hit me?

01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:21.913
Like you hit mom?

01:25:29.921 --> 01:25:32.841
I bet you think the whole world
is pretty black and white,

01:25:32.924 --> 01:25:34.008
don't you?

01:25:34.717 --> 01:25:37.512
I'm willing to guess
there's a lot more of the old man in you

01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:38.763
than you're willing to admit.

01:25:43.643 --> 01:25:44.561
Maybe.

01:25:45.937 --> 01:25:47.230
But just in case,

01:25:47.897 --> 01:25:50.191
I uploaded a shit ton
of incriminating evidence

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.235
from Skip's phone to the Cloud.

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:55.155
Anything happens to us,
it all gets released.

01:26:01.035 --> 01:26:01.911
You can go.

01:26:11.379 --> 01:26:12.672
Next time,

01:26:12.755 --> 01:26:14.757
get your boys to lock their phones.

01:26:16.092 --> 01:26:17.385
No, no, no. Not him.

01:26:17.468 --> 01:26:18.636
[Nick] That's… He was…

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.929
He chose this,

01:26:20.388 --> 01:26:21.723
and I'm not asking.

01:26:22.932 --> 01:26:24.142
[Murph] It's okay, Alex.

01:26:25.435 --> 01:26:26.477
He's right.

01:26:32.233 --> 01:26:33.651
See you around, Nick.

01:26:40.366 --> 01:26:41.451
Let's go.

01:26:42.118 --> 01:26:43.119
Leave him.

01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:49.918
[engines start]

01:27:08.853 --> 01:27:09.979
[engine starts]

01:27:28.122 --> 01:27:29.916
[motorcycles approaching]

01:28:24.262 --> 01:28:25.263
[gun clicks]

01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:27.974
Oh.

01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:55.251
I'll be seeing ya.

01:28:57.253 --> 01:28:58.296
Probably.

01:29:30.119 --> 01:29:33.039
[woman] Your transcripts
are clearly impeccable.

01:29:33.122 --> 01:29:35.917
It's obvious you were
diligent in your studies.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.834
Thank you.

01:29:36.918 --> 01:29:38.920
But we like to get to know each candidate

01:29:39.003 --> 01:29:41.255
on a more personal level.

01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:45.051
It helps to give us a sense of
what kind of contribution

01:29:45.134 --> 01:29:48.679
we can expect from our serious students.

01:29:48.763 --> 01:29:50.056
Character counts.

01:29:52.391 --> 01:29:53.559
Of course.

01:29:53.643 --> 01:29:58.231
So, then, could you please tell us
about a time in your life

01:29:58.314 --> 01:30:02.985
that best exemplifies a moment
where you had to overcome adversity,

01:30:04.028 --> 01:30:08.741
and how that experience has gone on
to shape the person that you are today?

01:30:10.535 --> 01:30:12.161
[inhales deeply]
