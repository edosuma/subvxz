Previously on Good Trouble...

00:02.340 --> 00:03.719
His only crime was being a black kid

00:03.750 --> 00:05.240
in a white neighborhood.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.380
Maybe we should...

00:06.400 --> 00:07.420
Steer clear of each other.

00:07.450 --> 00:08.940
Where were you?

00:08.970 --> 00:10.600
I don't see why you guys
have to sneak around.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.919
Everybody knows everybody's
business here.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.960
I don't want 'em knowing mine.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.560
That's a thing, right?

00:15.600 --> 00:18.140
The customizable filters was my idea.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.960
Great minds... right?

00:19.980 --> 00:22.650
While I may hate working at Speculate,

00:22.660 --> 00:24.180
I do love those fat paychecks.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.100
You know what they say about
all work and no play.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.600
Yeah, I'm a pretty dull girl.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.380
I don't believe that.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.940
I don't like playing games.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.720
I don't like being lied to.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:02.120 --> 01:03.400
Maybe they're having a hard time

01:03.430 --> 01:04.470
finding somewhere to park.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.600
Oh, Alice and Davia offered to cook

01:07.650 --> 01:09.080
a big dinner for Moms tomorrow night.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.190
Maybe we should go out.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.100
You know how everyone can get sometimes.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.990
I'm sure everyone will be
on their best behavior.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.360
You need to chill.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.250
Moms aren't exactly thrilled

01:19.260 --> 01:21.610
about this whole communal living thing.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.850
And I want them to
have a good impression

01:23.880 --> 01:24.910
of The Coterie.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.220
How's it looking?

01:38.280 --> 01:40.300
It looks amazing.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.160
Oh, but there's like a
little bubble there,

01:42.180 --> 01:43.220
you see it right there on your left?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.230
- Yeah, got it.
- Perfect.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.510
Yay.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.839
Hi!

01:53.840 --> 01:55.720
Just right over there by that fireplace.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.200
- Hi! Thank you.
- You guys need help?

02:02.220 --> 02:03.740
Um, just right over there is perfect.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.900
_

02:38.500 --> 02:40.000
_

02:54.710 --> 02:56.100
What about Gael?

02:56.140 --> 02:57.520
What kind of impression do you want

02:57.540 --> 02:58.799
Moms to have of him?

02:58.800 --> 02:59.859
What do you mean?

02:59.860 --> 03:01.510
How are you gonna introduce him?

03:01.550 --> 03:02.700
As your secret lover?

03:02.740 --> 03:05.120
Not introducing him as anything.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.880
It's like we're in a relationship.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.230
You ever afraid you won't...

03:45.930 --> 03:48.120
be able to live up to your potential?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.160
All the time.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.570
The longer she's been gone,

04:00.610 --> 04:02.570
the harder it is to remember her.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.780
I was only 10 when she died.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.920
What was foster care like?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.820
A nightmare.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.750
I think you are

04:14.790 --> 04:16.920
a really talented artist.

04:25.010 --> 04:29.100
We're so lucky Stef and Lena found us.

04:30.340 --> 04:34.240
I wouldn't be who I am
today without them.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.480
Might not even...

04:38.520 --> 04:40.300
be here at all.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.580
Thank God you are.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.040
So, do you think Gael's
still seeing Bryan?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.700
I don't know.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.940
How could he? You're
up there every night.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.220
Not every night.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.120
Okay, so it's important
that we are excited

04:59.140 --> 05:00.660
about their first apartment.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.840
We trust them,

05:01.880 --> 05:04.410
and we're not overly
protective or critical.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.100
Got it.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.220
If their hair's on fire,
just smile and say nothing.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.380
They're here.

05:21.140 --> 05:22.280
Do you ladies know where I can find

05:22.300 --> 05:23.570
the manager of this place?

05:23.610 --> 05:25.480
Um, that would be me.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.750
Something wrong?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.999
We got an anonymous tip that
this place is a fire trap.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.460
Fire trap? What?

05:32.690 --> 05:34.239
- You're here! Hi!
- Yay!

05:34.240 --> 05:36.080
- Hi!
- Hey.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.240
- Missed me?
- Yeah, beautiful girl.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.130
Look at you. How was the drive?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.760
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, of course.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.620
- Hi, hello.
- Oh! Alice.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.380
These are our moms, Stef and Lena.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.640
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.579
- You guys have amazing hair.
- Nice to meet you.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.310
I can see one problem right away.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.770
There's lights out on an exit sign.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.420
I think it's just dimmer in the daytime.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.440
Uh, let's show you The Coterie.

05:57.460 --> 05:58.719
- What's going on?
- This way.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.880
Um, hey ladies,

05:59.900 --> 06:01.860
can anyone just come up on
this elevator? 'Cause we just

06:01.900 --> 06:03.100
you know, right up here.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.740
Oh, well they lock the lobby doors

06:04.750 --> 06:06.100
after 10:00 PM at night.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.060
Which is annoying if
you forget your key.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.490
Especially when you wake me
up at 3:00 AM to let you in.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.000
Why are you coming home at 3:00 AM?

06:12.700 --> 06:15.320
Uh, you know, just on the weekend.

06:15.380 --> 06:16.480
Here, lemme help you with this.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.320
So this the grand foyer!

06:41.440 --> 06:43.660
My goodness, this is very grand.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.340
This is absolutely gorgeous.

06:45.350 --> 06:47.000
Okay, what about The Coterie door?

06:47.020 --> 06:49.580
- There's no lock on...
- Oh, we have locks on our lofts.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.480
How often do you change

06:51.500 --> 06:52.720
the batteries on the fire alarms?

06:52.740 --> 06:53.999
Uh, every six months.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.990
You know when we fall
back and spring forward.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.560
Um, so this is the bathroom.

06:58.620 --> 06:59.640
Over here.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.520
Okay, go see the bathrooms.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.900
Oh. There's no wall.

07:05.620 --> 07:06.680
Wow.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.920
You guys do know everyone
that lives here, right?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.130
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.670
Hi.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.160
Hi!

07:17.340 --> 07:18.879
Uh, these are our moms.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.779
Hey, Moms. I'm Aria.

07:20.780 --> 07:21.940
- Yes, Aria.
- That's right.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.120
It's okay, we haven't met.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.360
I don't live here.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.580
- Right.
- We knew that.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.180
Hey.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.650
I'm Dennis. I do live here.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.160
It's nice to meet you.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.640
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.490
- No.
- Okay.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.480
Let's keep going with the tour.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.910
Hey, we got an improv class later,

07:38.960 --> 07:40.380
- if you're interested.
- Cool.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.060
Oh! And I baked some cookies.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.670
They're on the kitchen table.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.520
- Have fun.
- Hey, you too.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.099
So, that's the kitchen,
that's the lounge.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.110
Oh, and look.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.639
Here are the cookies.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.930
Oh! Thank you, sweetheart. I'm starving.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.259
When was the last time the fire
extinguisher was certified?

07:58.260 --> 08:00.140
Uh, recently? I think.

08:00.190 --> 08:01.920
Davia had bangs, I remember.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.320
Right this way.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.880
Callie, sweetheart, what is...

08:06.960 --> 08:10.240
So, this is like, the library.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.500
This is amazing.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.320
Where are the fire
extinguishers, anyway?

08:13.340 --> 08:15.100
Uh, and our loft.

08:18.620 --> 08:19.700
Ta-da!

08:19.720 --> 08:22.500
Oh, this is absolutely gorgeous.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.640
Look at these amazing windows!

08:25.700 --> 08:27.860
Wow, where'd you get all this furniture?

08:27.880 --> 08:30.490
Uh, Mariana's been on a shopping spree.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.220
You know, just Craigslist and sales.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.860
Well, it's all very tasteful.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.640
Thank you. Picked it all out myself.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.039
Um, I got you these.

08:41.059 --> 08:45.319
Shampoos and toothbrushes
and toilet paper.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.620
- Wow.
- Yeah.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.720
- Sweetheart, amazing.
- How long are we staying for?

08:49.600 --> 08:50.940
The toilet paper used to be free,

08:50.960 --> 08:52.620
but Alice had this huge meltdown

08:52.640 --> 08:54.550
because everyone was over-wiping.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.539
Aw, poor Alice.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.880
Um, speaking of the bathroom.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.120
Who's that guy Dennis?

09:00.160 --> 09:01.380
What's his story?

09:01.400 --> 09:02.600
Oh, uh...

09:02.640 --> 09:05.340
- He's definitely the oldest person here.
- Mmm.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.750
I don't really know
what he does for money.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.079
But we wants to be a rock star.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.600
Uh, he's a really nice guy.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.180
Yeah, totally. He's
just a little intense.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
So, how are your jobs going?

09:15.590 --> 09:16.960
- Really good.
- Great.

09:16.970 --> 09:17.980
Yeah?

09:17.990 --> 09:19.880
I mean, I know you can't talk
about what goes on in chambers,

09:19.900 --> 09:21.160
but any interesting cases?

09:24.190 --> 09:25.190
Hey.

09:25.980 --> 09:27.400
Hey.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.220
Can I come in?

09:31.030 --> 09:32.320
Um...

09:32.360 --> 09:34.720
I just wanted to let you know that...

09:34.780 --> 09:37.500
our moms are coming
to stay this weekend.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.140
And I haven't told them
about the Jamal case.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.900
Or that I'm clerking it.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.780
I won't out you.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.710
And I can make myself scarce.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.920
No, I want them to meet you.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.280
I think they'd really like you.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.800
I just don't want them to...

09:52.840 --> 09:55.000
feel like things are weird between us.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.020
- I'm sorry it's weird.
- Me, too.

09:58.780 --> 10:01.720
Hopefully once the trial's
over, it won't be.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.640
Yeah.

10:04.340 --> 10:05.400
A few.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.640
But like you said,

10:06.660 --> 10:08.600
I really can't talk about them.

10:09.230 --> 10:11.020
This is tempered glass, right?

10:11.070 --> 10:12.570
'Cause it's, you know...

10:12.610 --> 10:14.299
Right over I don't know who sleeps here.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.539
But who's bed is this?

10:15.540 --> 10:17.299
- Um...
- What's this for?

10:19.070 --> 10:22.060
Um, oh, that. Um...

10:22.260 --> 10:24.370
That is our chamber pot.

10:24.410 --> 10:26.200
Um, just in case you don't want to run

10:26.220 --> 10:27.750
to the communal bathroom in the night.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.300
You pee in it.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.219
But you don't poop in it because, um...

10:32.220 --> 10:33.340
Okay.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.420
I asked you to do one thing.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.520
I'm sorry I forgot to hide the pee pot.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.719
Did you have to mention
all The Coterie drama?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.760
Are you purposely trying
to freak Moms out?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.799
You're the only one that's
freaking out. Moms are fine.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.120
It's not just about
where they are living,

10:47.160 --> 10:48.480
it is who they are living with.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.759
What is up with this Dennis character

10:49.760 --> 10:50.819
and the young girl?

10:50.820 --> 10:52.399
For all we know, he could be a predator

10:52.400 --> 10:54.499
that is trying to get our
daughters in the showers.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.139
- They take showers together!
- Would you stop?

10:56.140 --> 10:57.579
- Calm down and sit.
- But...

10:57.580 --> 10:59.000
Just stop. Please.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.779
Lena, remember our
one-minute meditation?

11:00.780 --> 11:02.260
Okay, a one-minute meditation

11:02.280 --> 11:03.780
- is not gonna change...
- Shush.

11:03.820 --> 11:04.940
- Please don't shush me.
- Shush.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.060
- I'm upset and...
- Shush.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.720
Close your eyes.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.090
A minute is just a moment
with handles on it.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.160
A beginning, a middle, and an end.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.740
I'm gonna finish my
cookie while we do this.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.500
Just breathe.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.020
These are really good.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.020
I feel like Mama's okay,
but Mom seems anxious.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.660
You think her anxiety's back?

11:28.690 --> 11:31.020
I think you're projecting.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.230
You know, you could've splurged

11:32.270 --> 11:33.720
on a more expensive bottle of wine.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.400
I'll leave the splurging to you.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.480
_

11:54.600 --> 11:57.320
So, this is the roof.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.760
Callie spends a lot of time up here.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.860
Wow, look at that view.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.100
And the pool.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.660
- Oh.
- Oh.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.160
This is Gael.

12:09.180 --> 12:10.500
Hi there.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.380
Hi! Hi, Gael.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.570
- Really nice to meet you.
- I'm one of the moms.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.959
Nice to meet you.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.970
- Blegh.
- I'm sorry.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.160
Didn't mean to get you wet.

12:20.180 --> 12:21.780
I bet you say that to all the ladies.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.549
Look at the color of the sky right now.

12:24.550 --> 12:25.560
Wow.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.679
It is beautiful. You're right, baby.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.820
Uh, this is Bryan.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.640
- Yeah, sorry.
- Hi.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.740
It's the other guy.

12:31.820 --> 12:34.179
- How are you?
- Oh, no, I won't... Get you wet.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.060
Aww. Why not? That's not fair.

12:38.510 --> 12:39.760
So, where do you guys live?

12:39.770 --> 12:41.130
Well, I don't live here.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.820
Why are there so many half naked people

12:42.840 --> 12:44.260
who don't live here running around here?

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
This is my loft.

12:45.310 --> 12:46.320
- This is your loft?
- Yeah.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.080
- So you do live here?
- Yeah.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.340
Was this a greenhouse?

12:50.180 --> 12:52.240
Yeah, used to be in the old days.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.900
You must get amazing light.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.680
I have always wanted to
live in a greenhouse.

12:57.890 --> 13:00.160
I think I was a plant in a former life.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.600
I think I was Cleopatra.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.580
- You guys wanna check it out?
- Can we? Yes, please.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.250
'Cause she wants to see the loft.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.560
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry. It's a push.

13:12.780 --> 13:16.180
You gotta push to get in here.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.470
Look at the way the
golden light of day's end

13:19.480 --> 13:20.920
washes over these walls.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.019
Is this a working tub?

13:23.020 --> 13:25.800
It is so big. Like, two
people can fit in here.

13:25.820 --> 13:26.970
Have you ever done that?

13:27.010 --> 13:29.960
Oh, my God, my wrinkles.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.140
Are Moms drunk?

13:32.180 --> 13:34.060
They've had, like, a
half a glass of wine.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.840
Did you do this?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.300
Yeah, I did.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.560
I think I see the shape
of a bison in there.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.400
No way, baby look at this.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.460
It's like a maze. Ooh!

13:43.500 --> 13:46.580
These textures. Do you see?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.300
I see a pickle.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.090
Okay, maybe we should get
you guys something to eat.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.700
I want chips.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.550
- Okay.
- And beef.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.660
- Bison.
- Yes.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.260
Like a bison burger.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.560
Thanks.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.840
Bye.

14:02.740 --> 14:05.980
So, is Bryan Gael's boyfriend?

14:06.020 --> 14:08.100
- I don't know.
- They're dating.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.070
Like, casually. I think.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.040
- What do I know?
- Nothing.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.740
Whoa.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.230
You sure you don't wanna do some improv?

14:18.270 --> 14:20.690
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

14:20.730 --> 14:22.360
What?

14:22.380 --> 14:24.610
It'll be fun. Let's do this.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.360
Here I go! I'm in!

14:26.420 --> 14:27.799
Yes! Alright.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.120
- Please don't touch me.
- Okay, I'm sorry. Yes.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.140
Suggestion from the audience.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.899
- Chocolate.
- This is gonna be a disaster.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.710
This is gonna be hilarious.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.680
How long you been driving a taxi?

14:45.700 --> 14:48.340
It's not a taxi, it's a...

14:48.840 --> 14:51.759
It's a... It's a spaceship.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.920
- Gonna go to Jupiter...
- Yeah, okay so...

14:55.930 --> 14:58.060
I'm sorry, I just have
to stop for one second.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.810
Um, in improv...

14:59.850 --> 15:01.460
We always say, "Yes, and... "

15:01.480 --> 15:03.740
So you never negate
what you've been given.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.080
So are going back in now?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.579
- Yeah, let's start over.
- Okay.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.650
So...

15:08.700 --> 15:11.040
- How long you been driving a taxi?
- Yes, and...

15:13.700 --> 15:15.600
He died too young.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.180
But he lived like a rock star.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.979
I heard he wanted to be a rock star.

15:18.980 --> 15:22.260
He taught me how to do
downward dog in the dark.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.780
How old are you?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.180
Old enough to know true love.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.879
I'm serious. How old are you?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.759
Do your parents know that you're here?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.380
- It's... I'm okay.
- I'm really afraid...

15:31.460 --> 15:32.739
Who invited the mom?

15:34.580 --> 15:36.120
Do you know why I've
called you into my office?

15:36.140 --> 15:37.899
Yes. Yes, I do. And
I'm not gonna let you

15:37.900 --> 15:40.200
lick my feet anymore.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.440
I'm gonna have to report you to HR then.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.080
You mean H.R. Pufnstuf?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.440
H.R. Puffy stuff?

15:45.460 --> 15:46.570
No, Pufnstuf.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.380
Pufn... Like puffin' on a joint.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.300
Oh, he's a giant puppet
from a 70s kid show.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
Well, she happens to
be a friend of mine.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.750
I seriously doubt that because you see,

15:59.760 --> 16:01.000
she's over 25.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.800
Okay, you need to call
your mother right now.

16:04.820 --> 16:06.740
'Cause I know that she is
worried and concerned.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.790
Let's just get back to the...

16:08.800 --> 16:09.819
I hope you're 18.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.300
Okay.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.099
I'm sorry.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.299
Even though you could see
like, all of his junk.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.840
- Yeah.
- Oh, by the way, did anyone try

16:48.850 --> 16:50.459
those cookies Aria made?

16:50.460 --> 16:51.880
No. I didn't.

16:51.930 --> 16:54.800
Oh, my God. I'm so stoned right now.

16:56.050 --> 16:59.220
Oh. Oh. Ohhhh!

16:59.810 --> 17:01.360
Where's Mama?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.079
We don't want your kind here!

17:50.080 --> 17:51.380
No negroes!

17:56.110 --> 17:57.660
No colored people!

18:07.640 --> 18:09.580
This looks great. This
looks really great.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.260
So when we're done here, I'll just...

18:11.280 --> 18:13.470
Maybe start on that end. I'm
gonna start right here,

18:13.480 --> 18:15.260
and just aim for like, 50 emails.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.300
Thank you.

18:18.020 --> 18:19.930
Hi, I'm Lena Adams Foster.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.180
I'm running for State Assembly,

18:21.220 --> 18:22.390
and I was wondering, do you have a...

18:22.430 --> 18:24.680
Okay, thank you.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.100
Hi. I'm Lena Adams Foster.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.440
I'm a Democrat running
for State Assembly.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.240
And I believe we can end homelessness

18:32.260 --> 18:34.579
by making housing a right.
Do you think that...

18:34.580 --> 18:36.320
We should get the bums off the street.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.760
I'm sick of the eyesores
of these tent cities.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.440
Well, I wanna sponsor a bill
that will force developers

18:41.460 --> 18:42.620
developers to build affordable housing.

18:42.630 --> 18:45.410
You lib-tards are all
about the handouts.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.580
And you lazy blacks are the worst.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.460
Okay, thank you for your time.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.700
You know, you people wanna
divide this country

18:53.720 --> 18:55.500
with your "Black Lives Matter" bullshit.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.420
Well they don't.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.500
You want your lives to matter?

18:59.600 --> 19:00.900
Go get jobs.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.640
You people want to divide
this... You lazy blacks...

19:03.680 --> 19:04.960
Black Lives Matter...

19:05.020 --> 19:06.100
Go get jobs.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.460
- Who are you?
- Mama!

19:25.460 --> 19:26.980
Are you okay?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.980
I feel funny.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.519
- Sorry, sorry.
- That looks amazing.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.080
Hey, you two aren't
supposed to lift a finger!

19:41.100 --> 19:42.550
Ah, no, no, no. It's
okay. We don't mind.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.850
Kinda miss cooking for a
big family. Hint, hint.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.350
Oh, my gosh, that smells so good.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.300
Ooh! Hot baklava.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.120
Hey, where you going?

19:53.270 --> 19:54.860
Uh, to get a bite.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.240
Join us. The Moms are here.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.399
We're celebrating.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.500
We have plenty of food.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.080
You sure?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.480
Listen, um...

20:05.500 --> 20:08.160
My moms are coming to stay
with us this weekend.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.710
And... They don't know about us.

20:12.750 --> 20:16.440
If they did, they'd probably,
like, out us to everyone.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.510
It's not like we're in a relationship.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.640
So I just wanted to let you know

20:22.740 --> 20:25.820
that I'm not, like, gonna
introduce you as anything.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.780
Um, yeah. No, yeah. No problem.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.760
I get it.

20:34.270 --> 20:36.700
- Night.
- Night.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.100
- You sure?
- Yes. We're sure.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.320
But we're not gonna beg.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.220
How can I help?

20:48.240 --> 20:49.620
Uh, light the candles, please.

20:49.630 --> 20:52.760
So, Malika, why social anthropology?

20:52.780 --> 20:55.000
I've always been fascinated
by different cultures

20:55.020 --> 20:56.900
and social relationships.

20:56.940 --> 20:58.920
Have you seen the
CosmoLearning documentaries?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.579
Yes, I love those.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.059
Did you see the one that's
coming up next month?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.140
- Yeah.
- So good.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.400
That's exactly why

21:04.420 --> 21:06.039
I wanted to make Ethiopian food tonight.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.779
I really wanna study abroad, too.

21:07.780 --> 21:08.879
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.240
That would be such an opportunity.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.819
I mean, what would happen

21:12.820 --> 21:14.760
if the judge found out
we knew each other?

21:15.270 --> 21:17.840
I'd probably be taken off the case.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.860
And he'd give it to Ben or Becca.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.240
Would that be so bad?

21:22.260 --> 21:23.639
They won't challenge him.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.200
Hey. So, uh,

21:25.300 --> 21:27.200
what's it like living
above the Palace Theater?

21:27.220 --> 21:28.870
Do they still have shows?

21:28.910 --> 21:30.140
Yeah, they do.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.480
Do you know everyone who lives there?

21:32.790 --> 21:34.200
No, I don't.

21:40.460 --> 21:41.960
Why?

21:42.550 --> 21:44.020
No reason.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.220
I'm the clerk.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.400
Now that I know that he
wants me to spar with him,

21:51.420 --> 21:53.050
I might win an argument,

21:53.060 --> 21:56.440
or at least, make him consider
something he might not have.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.800
Look, um...

21:58.900 --> 22:01.460
I'm not that tight with Jamal's mom.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.360
I mean, I did those T-shirts for her.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.720
I can do my thing from a distance.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.960
Maybe it's not okay for
me to ask you to do that.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.080
Look, Callie,

22:12.120 --> 22:13.840
if you think you can make a difference,

22:15.370 --> 22:17.180
then go do it.

22:19.060 --> 22:20.580
Okay.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.420
Night.

22:47.980 --> 22:50.060
So, Gael...

22:50.120 --> 22:52.480
Mariana tells me that you guys
work together at Speculate.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.240
Yeah, I'm a graphic designer.

22:54.260 --> 22:55.760
Yeah, how do you like that?

22:55.780 --> 22:57.200
I like it.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.459
I'm actually an independent contractor,

22:59.460 --> 23:01.580
so my hours are a little
bit more flexible

23:01.600 --> 23:03.080
so I can work on my art.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.520
Oh, and how's that going? Your art.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.130
I mean...

23:07.170 --> 23:08.400
With all the people you're dating,

23:08.440 --> 23:09.880
how do you find the time?

23:17.270 --> 23:18.930
Dav, I'm really into him.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.700
I know.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.750
It's hard competing with Callie

23:23.770 --> 23:25.220
when she lives here and she can just

23:25.240 --> 23:27.720
sneak up to his place
whenever she wants.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.400
Now he says he's working on his art.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.520
But I don't see any new pieces.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.620
Yeah, well...

23:35.720 --> 23:37.740
His art sucks anyway.

23:39.870 --> 23:41.180
Why don't we all sit?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.380
Look like we're ready.

23:43.290 --> 23:45.300
Enjoy the fruits of our labor here.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.200
So, Davia, the girls tell
me that you are a teacher.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.240
Well, I mean if it counts
after six weeks of training.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.999
But, how long did you teach for?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.520
For 10 years before I became

23:54.540 --> 23:55.900
Vice Principal of Anchor Beach.

23:55.940 --> 23:57.060
And knows she's Principal.

23:57.140 --> 23:59.320
She's also on the San
Diego Board of Education.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.890
Oh, Mama,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.190
what happens if you win the election?

24:02.230 --> 24:03.360
Yeah, can you be on the Board

24:03.380 --> 24:05.780
- and the State Assembly?
- I'd have to resign.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.600
But I think I may be
dropping out of the race.

24:08.620 --> 24:09.860
- Why?
- Why?

24:09.920 --> 24:12.080
Well, there are a lot of
candidates crowding the field,

24:12.100 --> 24:13.860
and there's some concern
from party members

24:13.880 --> 24:16.640
about splitting the Democratic vote.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.950
Sorry we're late.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.200
Oh, great.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.160
Since we made dinner,
you two can clean up.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.700
Hello.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.500
Hey.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.860
Sorry about the improv thing.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.400
Your girlfriend made those
cookies and I had one

24:43.420 --> 24:45.120
- and...
- She's not my girlfriend.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.220
Okay well, whatever she is.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.839
I ate one of her cookies and
they were pretty strong.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.220
- She's a good cook.
- Look, it's fine.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.530
Alright? You just said what
everyone else is thinking.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.350
That I'm the creepy old guy
that dates younger women

24:58.380 --> 25:01.579
and still thinks he's got a
shot at being a rock star.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.520
It's nothing personal. It's just we...

25:04.560 --> 25:06.660
Care about what our daughters are doing,

25:06.680 --> 25:07.720
where they are, who they're living with,

25:07.730 --> 25:10.640
which seems to be,
apparently, a lot of people.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.460
Just concerned that they're safe.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.200
And I do not know what
my girls have told you,

25:15.220 --> 25:17.760
but I used to be a detective
in human trafficking,

25:17.810 --> 25:19.519
so please forgive the stereotype

25:19.520 --> 25:21.310
but whenever I see...

25:21.350 --> 25:23.220
An older man with a younger girl,

25:23.260 --> 25:25.260
it kind of sets me off,
to be quiet honest.

25:26.310 --> 25:27.720
Or, you know, it could just be me

25:27.740 --> 25:30.180
having a hard time letting go, uh...

25:30.740 --> 25:33.400
Accepting that maybe they
don't need us anymore.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.000
Or it could be perhaps that
I'm still a little stoned.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.740
Anyway...

25:42.460 --> 25:44.559
Someday if you have kids,

25:44.560 --> 25:46.140
maybe you'll understand.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.380
I had a kid.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.940
You had a kid?

26:06.040 --> 26:07.340
A son.

26:08.980 --> 26:12.160
We lost him when he was 6, rare cancer.

26:14.450 --> 26:16.200
I'm sorry.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.920
Yeah, I had the big
house, a corporate job.

26:22.340 --> 26:26.380
After Jacob died, I just...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.560
couldn't play the game anymore.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.780
Couldn't be what my
wife needed me to be.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.580
Um...

26:35.620 --> 26:37.200
After our marriage fell apart,

26:37.220 --> 26:39.300
I... thought...

26:39.350 --> 26:41.119
Why not do what you always wanted to?

26:41.120 --> 26:42.280
Play music.

26:43.660 --> 26:46.460
So, I moved in here where everyone is...

26:46.480 --> 26:49.020
too young to have a kid, and...

26:49.040 --> 26:50.980
too self-involved to
ask what my story is.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.780
Look, I know I'm not
gonna be a rock star.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.580
I just... I just need something that...

27:03.300 --> 27:05.600
can fill me up a little.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.370
Jacob would've been 8 this week.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.760
His birthday...

27:28.640 --> 27:30.770
So I guess I haven't asked Aria to leave

27:30.810 --> 27:33.000
because I don't wanna be alone.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.060
I don't think you're alone here.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.110
A lot of people really care about you,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.080
from what I can see.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.960
Just ask, you know?

27:51.380 --> 27:53.980
I feel like I'm always alone.

27:59.380 --> 28:00.880
Look...

28:00.930 --> 28:03.659
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell your daughters about this.

28:03.660 --> 28:05.979
Okay? I don't need people
feeling sorry for me.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.820
I don't...

28:07.900 --> 28:09.470
I'm perfectly fine

28:09.520 --> 28:11.120
remaining the creepy old man...

28:11.180 --> 28:12.940
- of the group.
- Okay.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.660
That's not a problem.

28:17.340 --> 28:19.360
I know you got a reputation to uphold.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.400
You're not that old.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.500
A little creepy, but not that old.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.060
Fair enough.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.040
Oh, no. Aria, do you
have a place to live?

28:33.060 --> 28:35.160
You know, besides here.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.380
Davia...

28:36.420 --> 28:38.300
What? I'm just saying
if she's gonna move in,

28:38.340 --> 28:39.380
Dennis needs to pay more rent.

28:39.420 --> 28:41.320
She's not moving in. Relax.

28:41.330 --> 28:43.060
Okay well, I believe the rules are that

28:43.080 --> 28:44.940
if someone stays more than
a night at The Coterie,

28:44.960 --> 28:46.050
they have to get permission.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.980
Hm. Did Callie and
Mariana ask permission

28:48.000 --> 28:49.440
for their parents to stay?

28:49.760 --> 28:51.220
Maybe I should go.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
No.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.860
Stay for dinner.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.820
Yes, Aria, you can stay for dinner

28:59.860 --> 29:00.980
but you can't stay forever.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.400
Why are you being such an ass tonight?

29:02.420 --> 29:04.319
I'm just saying what
everyone else is thinking.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.720
And everyone's thinking
about who I'm dating.

29:05.740 --> 29:08.530
I'm sorry, Gael. But Bryan is my
friend and I'm protecting him.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.220
Okay, Davia. You need to chill.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.500
- Don't.
- What? I'm protective of you,

29:12.510 --> 29:14.380
and everyone knows that
you're hooking up with Gael.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.680
- It's not a big deal.
- Mariana!

29:18.500 --> 29:19.959
Uh, you know what?

29:19.960 --> 29:22.480
We need to get a picture of
the girls with their moms.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.209
For our party picture wall.

29:24.210 --> 29:25.219
Great idea.

29:25.220 --> 29:27.340
We have a party picture wall?

29:27.350 --> 29:29.539
Not yet, but I think it's a good idea.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.860
- Come on, squeeze together.
- You're on fire, Alice.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.560
Trust me, you'll thank me later.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.840
Okay, let's do it.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.120
One, two...

29:36.520 --> 29:38.380
Big smiles.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.979
Three. Great.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.770
What a nice tradition I just started.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.940
I'm not that tight with Jamal's mom.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.380
Malika.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.180
I'm sorry to interrupt y'all's dinner.

30:40.130 --> 30:43.020
So, when's the show start?

30:43.040 --> 30:44.300
Already did.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.720
Not sure what I thought of the girl

30:46.730 --> 30:48.700
who stormed out of the
dinner scene though.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.680
She's a little dramatic.

30:51.160 --> 30:55.840
I think, considering the circumstances,

30:55.890 --> 30:58.480
she didn't really have a choice.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.550
I know living here with Malika

31:06.560 --> 31:08.140
can be complicated for you.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.240
Living here with you is, too.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.460
Hurt seeing you with Bryan.

31:19.330 --> 31:20.500
I'm sorry.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.540
No, it's okay. We see other people.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.540
Yeah.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.980
And I guess it hurt me when
you said you didn't...

31:33.020 --> 31:36.460
wanna introduce me as
anything to your moms.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.800
I know we're not in
some committed thing,

31:38.820 --> 31:41.040
but I don't think we
have to be exclusive

31:41.060 --> 31:44.600
to admit that this thing
isn't just casual.

31:45.020 --> 31:46.420
Not for me.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.060
It isn't for me, either.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.640
I'm sorry. I should've called.

31:59.780 --> 32:01.420
I was at the courthouse,

32:01.440 --> 32:03.420
so I thought I'd stop by and
pick up those T-shirts.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.940
It's okay.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.080
Well, um...

32:21.300 --> 32:23.800
I guess I'll let you get
back to your dinner party.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.220
I'll see you at the next protest.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.760
Let me know if

32:30.780 --> 32:32.440
there's anything you
need in the meantime.

32:35.490 --> 32:37.300
Thank you for these.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.400
Well, the good news is she
left her phone behind,

32:53.410 --> 32:55.009
and she can't be away
from it for too long

32:55.010 --> 32:57.320
without spontaneously combusting.

32:57.390 --> 32:58.780
See?

33:01.520 --> 33:03.940
Sorry I had to take off like that.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.020
We understand. Come sit.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.380
Mariana told us that you're the clerk

33:13.400 --> 33:15.060
on the Jamal Thompson case.

33:15.140 --> 33:16.140
Mariana!

33:16.150 --> 33:17.880
What? They're our moms. We
can tell them anything.

33:17.900 --> 33:20.400
How about I tell them that
you're $20,000 dollars in debt?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.980
You looked at my credit card bill?

33:23.990 --> 33:25.439
You leave your shit everywhere.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.940
Of course I was gonna see
your credit card bill.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.440
How on Earth are you $20,000 in debt?

33:29.470 --> 33:32.330
Look around. All she
does is party and shop.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.019
Okay, I'm sorry. You didn't seem to mind

33:34.020 --> 33:35.580
when I furnished our entire loft.

33:35.620 --> 33:37.260
I never asked you to.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.140
This is all your taste,
Mariana. Not mine.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.940
You furnished this for you, not us.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.919
Well, maybe if you actually
spent some time with me,

33:42.920 --> 33:43.990
we could have done this together!

33:44.000 --> 33:45.750
Maybe if you took your job
a little more seriously,

33:45.760 --> 33:46.809
you'd be busy working, too.

33:46.810 --> 33:48.700
- Well, I hate my job.
- I hate mine, too!

33:48.720 --> 33:49.980
Hey, hey. Okay, okay.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.500
Whoa. Hold on.

33:51.580 --> 33:52.760
Miss Thang come sit.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.000
Come sit.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.540
Please.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.700
How come you guys didn't tell us

34:03.720 --> 34:05.640
that you were struggling with your jobs?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.980
We didn't wanna worry you.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.960
You already have so much to deal with.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.210
We're supposed to be adults.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.659
Well, being an adult is hard.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.980
And that's why it helps to
be able to talk to someone

34:17.989 --> 34:19.590
who's done it for a long time.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.159
- Yeah, like you're good ol' moms.
- Mmm.

34:22.239 --> 34:23.860
We didn't wanna bother you.

34:24.820 --> 34:27.020
Oh, my goodness, please bother us.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.850
We miss you girls so much.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.500
We do.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.980
Do you know that your
Mama has me listening

34:33.030 --> 34:34.460
to Ted Talks?

34:35.719 --> 34:37.060
And minute meditations.

34:37.139 --> 34:39.199
Okay, did you guys know

34:39.239 --> 34:41.139
that minute is a moment

34:41.199 --> 34:43.239
with handles at both ends.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.199
- Okay, wow.
- No, no, no.

34:45.219 --> 34:46.739
Breathe with me, breathe with me.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.360
- This will help you ladies.
- You must miss us.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.580
Oh, you have no idea.

34:49.590 --> 34:51.438
We miss you crying on our shoulders.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.659
And forgetting to make your bed.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.960
Clean your rooms and
picking up after you.

34:55.050 --> 34:57.060
Let's not go too far.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.540
We don't stop being your mothers

34:59.560 --> 35:00.880
just 'cause you grow up.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.470
Bring it in.

35:10.690 --> 35:12.100
You know what I need?

35:12.160 --> 35:13.620
What, sweetheart?

35:13.720 --> 35:15.060
$20,000.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.020
No.

35:25.470 --> 35:28.250
Well, from my prospective, Cal,

35:28.290 --> 35:29.600
yeah, I think that you should disclose

35:29.620 --> 35:32.239
your relationship with
Malika to the judge, I do.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.940
Before he finds out about
it from someone else.

35:33.960 --> 35:34.979
Mmm.

35:34.980 --> 35:36.900
And Miss Thang, getting
yourself in debt,

35:36.960 --> 35:38.720
that is, that is, that is not good.

35:38.730 --> 35:39.920
That is bad, all bad.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.640
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.320
I'm just so frustrated at work.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.380
I didn't realize how much
hostility there would be

35:46.400 --> 35:47.700
because I'm a woman.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.280
And a Latina woman.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.620
I'm just buying things
to make me feel better.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.780
Things aren't gonna fill
you up, sweetheart.

35:53.820 --> 35:58.040
And I know how hard it is
to face discrimination.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.560
And going from being such
a superstar in college

36:01.570 --> 36:03.599
to being on the bottom
rung of the ladder

36:03.600 --> 36:06.480
when you get out into the working world.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.919
Especially being a woman and a minority.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.540
Well, you are gonna climb
that ladder so fast.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.919
Like, people's heads are gonna spin.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.960
They're gonna be like, "Oh,
whoa! Where'd she come from?"

36:15.040 --> 36:17.300
- Can't say it isn't. so.
- And you don't give up.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.699
And don't you get so frustrated

36:18.700 --> 36:20.439
that you get discouraged
and you stop trying.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.940
Okay. I won't.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.380
Promise.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.600
Sorry to interrupt.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.330
I just wanted to say I had no idea

36:27.360 --> 36:29.180
Jamal's mother would drop by like that.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.520
It's okay.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.900
It's hard because I
wanna be there for her

36:33.920 --> 36:36.820
and... I wanna be here for you.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.920
Well, that sounds like another
reason to disclose, huh?

36:43.570 --> 36:45.000
Wanna sit?

36:45.040 --> 36:46.640
Yeah, come.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.200
- Have a glass of wine.
- Yeah, join us.

36:48.260 --> 36:50.290
Uh, I didn't bring up a glass.

36:50.330 --> 36:52.000
It's okay, you can have mine.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.500
I drink out of the
bottle all of the time.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.479
Oh, okay. That's new information.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.740
Did I say that out loud actually?

36:56.750 --> 36:58.700
I'm so sorry.

36:58.740 --> 37:00.219
You better change the subject fast.

37:00.220 --> 37:01.839
Okay, new subject, new subject.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.460
Mama.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.840
Are you really dropping out of the race?

37:06.980 --> 37:09.640
We sold our house so you could run.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.350
Yeah, who's telling you
you should drop out?

37:11.390 --> 37:13.280
There are some party leaders

37:13.300 --> 37:16.320
who think I'm too
progressive, too black...

37:16.340 --> 37:18.660
- Too lesbian.
- ... to win.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.200
And they think that...
the Dems in San Diego

37:22.220 --> 37:24.340
who voted for this president

37:24.360 --> 37:25.940
are going to want a more centrist...

37:25.960 --> 37:27.300
White.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.830
Candidate.

37:28.870 --> 37:30.080
Screw the party leaders.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.060
- That's bullshit.
- Yes.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.839
You know, when I
wandered into your loft,

37:37.840 --> 37:39.640
stoned, sorry.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.220
It's okay.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.620
I was just memorized...

37:43.630 --> 37:46.440
by that photo of Elizabeth Eckford.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.820
It takes a lot of guts to
look at that everyday.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.640
I have to.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.160
It reminds me that we still gotta fight.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.499
If a 15-year-old girl can
brave a crowd like that,

38:01.500 --> 38:03.940
then I certainly can.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.960
This man spit on me

38:10.080 --> 38:12.100
when I was campaigning.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.910
Told me my life didn't matter

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
and he called me the "N" word.

38:17.180 --> 38:20.380
It's 2018.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.499
And some things have changed,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.899
but racism hasn't.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.880
It's still as ugly and
pervasive as it ever was.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.740
That's why you can't drop
out of the race, Mama.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.499
Yeah. You can't let this minority

38:32.500 --> 38:34.120
of ugly people in this country win.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.399
And we don't need more politicians

38:36.400 --> 38:38.800
who are trying to play
it safe in the middle.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.300
We need people who are willing
to fight for what's right.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.280
And who better to reform education...

38:52.300 --> 38:54.080
And fight against discrimination...

38:54.120 --> 38:56.100
- The right to healthcare...
- The right to choose...

38:56.110 --> 38:58.080
- Racial income equality...
- And protect our love

38:58.100 --> 39:00.160
- because LGBTQ rights are under attack.
- Fight for foster kids...

39:00.180 --> 39:02.699
- For transgender rights...
- Better wages for people,

39:02.700 --> 39:04.040
- not tax cuts for corporations.
- Immigrants and their children

39:04.060 --> 39:05.860
who are being detained in cages.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.400
To be out and proud.

39:07.420 --> 39:09.760
- To be kind and caring.
- To do what's truly right.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.719
And never let anyone tell
us we're not good enough.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.729
Even if you don't win,

39:13.730 --> 39:15.660
think of all the people
that you'll inspire.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.100
I never get to vote for
people who look like me,

39:18.110 --> 39:19.920
and understand the issues I face.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.360
We're Adams Fosters
and we don't give up.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.720
Our mamas taught us that.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.960
Okay.

39:33.490 --> 39:36.320
I am in it till the bitter end.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.580
And I will drink to that.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.360
Me, too.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.250
- To Mama.
- Cheers.

39:42.290 --> 39:44.040
Way to go.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.020
You wanna see a movie?

40:18.960 --> 40:20.600
You don't have work?

40:20.660 --> 40:22.060
Or Gael?

40:22.140 --> 40:24.980
I'd like to spend the
day with my sister.

40:25.170 --> 40:27.080
Aww.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.840
What do you wanna watch?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.760
- Uh, what do you wanna watch?
- No sci-fi.
