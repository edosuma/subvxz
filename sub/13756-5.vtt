<i>with religious and community leaders
at the Al-Khoei Islamic Center.</i>

01:42.690 --> 01:46.224
<i>The Islamic Center was one of five
places firebombed Sunday night.</i>

a 40-year-old Jamaica, Queens man.</i>

01:49.963 --> 01:54.399

to a car with Virginia license plates.</i>

physics. You know what I mean?</i>

02:06.947 --> 02:08.613

happened out of sequence...

02:08.648 --> 02:11.415
You're trying to make
it happen in real time,

02:11.451 --> 02:13.851

02:13.887 --> 02:16.554
(Saran Wrap crackles)

02:19.158 --> 02:21.492
- So you put criminals in jail?
- No.

02:21.527 --> 02:24.395
In fact, I, uh, kind of do the opposite.

02:24.430 --> 02:26.663
I try to keep them out of jail.

02:30.936 --> 02:33.904
Let's say your brother or
your cousin gets arrested

02:33.939 --> 02:38.274
because he looks like someone who
robbed a store, but it wasn't him.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.543
Well, what if it was him?

02:40.579 --> 02:44.347
He's still entitled to the
best defense he can get.

02:44.382 --> 02:47.350
- And that's you?
- (laughter)

02:48.821 --> 02:52.155
My dad actually puts them
away. He's a deputy inspector.

02:52.190 --> 02:53.556
So was mine.

02:53.592 --> 02:56.426
You can imagine how
disappointed he was in me.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.262
Would you defend Hitler?

03:00.632 --> 03:04.634
In theory, it'd be my duty
as an officer of the court.

03:04.669 --> 03:06.869
He killed my great-grandparents.

03:09.907 --> 03:12.608
You want to jump in here anytime soon?

03:12.644 --> 03:14.844
No. This is great.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.446
Great.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.916
Yeah, Hitler. Uh...

03:25.856 --> 03:29.424
It was just disrespectful.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.093
You came in on a workday. You
could've been making money.

03:32.129 --> 03:36.165

- They're assholes.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.533

You could've worn shoes, though.

She's withdrawn from the case.

05:23.003 --> 05:25.971
She's assigned it to me
and doesn't want anybody

05:26.006 --> 05:27.605
from the firm spending time on it,

05:27.641 --> 05:30.475
so I'm looking outside it for some help.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.677
Fifty grand.

05:32.712 --> 05:34.712
I'm authorized to spend no more than 20.

05:34.748 --> 05:37.815
Then it's not gonna work.
It goes to trial, it's, uh,

05:37.850 --> 05:41.919
two, three months of my
life. It's not enough.

05:41.954 --> 05:47.124
Last year, you billed for 60
grand, basically in $250 increments,

05:47.160 --> 05:49.627
45 percent of which is uncollected.

05:49.663 --> 05:52.963
That was for the year. This
is for a month or two.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.832
It's more than fair.

05:54.867 --> 05:58.769
Two or three months, I
said, not one or two.

05:59.772 --> 06:02.239
And where's the money coming from?

06:02.275 --> 06:04.374
I'm sure his parents don't have it.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.043
They'll have to get it.

06:06.078 --> 06:08.578
Beg, borrow, steal, whatever.

06:08.614 --> 06:11.848
- From who?
- The risk we take.

06:11.883 --> 06:14.117
No. The risk you take,

06:14.152 --> 06:16.085
because the only way I'll do this

06:16.121 --> 06:19.289
is if you pay me directly and in full.

06:19.325 --> 06:22.158
What you get from them or
don't get from them is your problem.

06:22.194 --> 06:25.361
I'm paid. Are you authorized to do that?

06:26.198 --> 06:28.264
If I am, you'll do it for 20?

06:29.634 --> 06:30.934
Thirty-five.

06:31.803 --> 06:34.637
- Twenty-five.
- Thirty.

06:37.843 --> 06:38.908
Okay.

06:38.944 --> 06:40.710
In writing.

06:41.779 --> 06:43.245
Okay.

06:49.253 --> 06:52.254
Weiss: Prints, blood, semen, witnesses.

06:52.289 --> 06:55.190
So we have everything
and they have nothing.

06:55.226 --> 06:58.293
What do you do when you have nothing?

06:58.329 --> 06:59.561
Plea.

06:59.596 --> 07:03.098
They had their chance and didn't.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.133
Go for insanity.

07:05.169 --> 07:07.102
I wouldn't, neither will they.

07:07.137 --> 07:08.703
Woman: Blame someone else.

07:08.739 --> 07:11.240
Someone else had that
knife in their pocket?

07:11.275 --> 07:13.441
Man: Some violation of his rights.

07:13.477 --> 07:16.177
There were none.

07:16.212 --> 07:20.915
If it were me, I'd focus
on one thing, the drugs.

07:20.950 --> 07:23.385
She drugged him. He's not responsible.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.988
That's no defense. They
don't know who gave who what.

07:27.023 --> 07:29.657
They'll try to find out.

07:44.374 --> 07:47.508
- What's ketamine?
- Why?

07:47.543 --> 07:50.811
It's what was in the
vial he had in his pocket.

07:50.846 --> 07:54.615
It's an anesthetic vets use on
horses when they do surgery.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.684
Why would anybody take that?

07:57.720 --> 08:01.988
Why would Michael Jackson
take propofol? Same reason.

08:03.825 --> 08:05.858
He took it to sleep, didn't he?

08:05.894 --> 08:08.328
Well, it worked for that.

08:13.101 --> 08:17.003
You take ketamine because...

08:19.741 --> 08:21.841

the polite word for it.

you mix it with coke,

edge off, so to speak.

- Oh. You look gorgeous.

Baby, a sight for sore eyes.
What you got here? Champagne?

40:57.636 --> 41:01.972
Now, here's to us. You
think of everything.

and amphetamine in him, not her.

41:31.502 --> 41:35.604
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

41:42.247 --> 41:44.480
This has to be a mistake.

41:44.515 --> 41:48.950
Why? Because you don't like
being lied to? I don't.

41:48.986 --> 41:51.787
Is there some way to determine
what kind of amphetamine it is?

41:51.822 --> 41:57.259
What difference does it make? Speed
is speed in court. Lies are lies.

41:57.294 --> 41:59.628
Why would he do that?

41:59.663 --> 42:01.630

Stone: Your skull. What do
you think I'm talking about?

43:06.294 --> 43:08.094
The tox screens came in.

43:08.129 --> 43:10.629
So, what did she give me?

43:10.665 --> 43:13.899
Stone: What do you think? Ecstasy, coke.

43:13.935 --> 43:16.869
It was "K" in the vial, not coke.

43:16.904 --> 43:18.737
You know what that is, ketamine?

43:26.080 --> 43:28.213
Anything else you want to tell us?

43:29.550 --> 43:30.783
What do you mean?

43:30.818 --> 43:33.251
What you took that night.

43:34.789 --> 43:36.154
I didn't take anything.

43:36.991 --> 43:39.124
Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Adderall,

43:39.159 --> 43:41.961
meth, some, or all of
the above. What was it?

43:41.996 --> 43:43.528
Nasir: I didn't take any of that.

43:43.563 --> 43:46.064
The screen is wrong, that's
what you're saying?

43:46.967 --> 43:47.899
What does it say?

43:47.934 --> 43:50.802
I just told you, speed in you, not her.

43:51.905 --> 43:53.538
Well, what about my inhaler?

43:53.573 --> 43:54.873
That's steroids,

43:54.908 --> 43:57.409
not amphetamines, not anymore.

43:57.444 --> 43:59.777
That stopped before you were born.

43:59.813 --> 44:02.246
Nasir: Isn't there
amphetamine in Ecstasy?

44:02.281 --> 44:05.617
What, are you a chemist
now? How would you know that?

44:05.652 --> 44:07.284
I don't. I'm asking.

44:09.589 --> 44:11.255
You're lying.

44:14.761 --> 44:16.693
My guess is Adderall.

44:16.729 --> 44:19.196
What college kid
doesn't take it? Am I right?

44:23.169 --> 44:26.303
You think that makes it okay? It's not.

44:26.339 --> 44:28.506
Let me explain to you why.

44:28.541 --> 44:32.308
One, without a
prescription, it's illegal.

44:32.344 --> 44:36.079
Two, you weren't up studying.
You were going to a party.

44:36.114 --> 44:41.351
Three, it counteracts the
sedative effects of the "K,"

44:41.386 --> 44:45.455
making your "I passed
out" story less believable.

44:45.490 --> 44:46.456
It's not a story.

44:46.491 --> 44:48.658
Four, you take enough,
it makes you psychotic.

44:48.693 --> 44:51.027
Five, you lied to me.

44:52.764 --> 44:57.467
So I'm gonna ask you
because your life depends upon it:

44:57.502 --> 45:00.937
What else have you lied about?

45:00.972 --> 45:02.872
Nothing.

45:02.907 --> 45:07.242
Everything you say happened, happened?
- Yes.

45:07.278 --> 45:13.082
Stone: She got in the
cab. You drove uptown.

45:13.117 --> 45:17.419
You stopped and bought
beer because she asked you to.

45:17.455 --> 45:22.491
You went to the river where she gave
you the "E," not the other way around.

45:22.526 --> 45:26.828
You drove to her place, had
words with that guy on the street.

45:26.863 --> 45:29.231
- You went inside...
- "Guys." You said "guy."

45:29.266 --> 45:33.268
There was two of them, him and
another guy. They were together.

45:36.607 --> 45:39.941
Now, I don't know why
you'd lie about that.

45:41.011 --> 45:43.411
But are you lying about that?

45:50.754 --> 45:52.921
Why would the guy lie about it?

45:52.956 --> 45:55.055
I don't know. Ask him.

45:55.091 --> 45:57.325
What did this other guy say or do?

45:57.360 --> 45:59.727
Nothing. He just stood there.

45:59.762 --> 46:01.695
(gags)

46:03.466 --> 46:04.798
I got to get back. Tito!

46:06.035 --> 46:07.768
Naz.

46:07.803 --> 46:10.338
Naz, I understand you have to do it,

46:10.373 --> 46:13.040
but if you're caught for this...

46:15.177 --> 46:17.845
the case is over,

46:17.880 --> 46:20.547
and you're never getting out of here.

46:40.101 --> 46:44.637
(Nasir breathing heavily, grunting)

46:49.243 --> 46:51.577
Ah!

46:54.615 --> 46:57.116
Ah! Yeah.

46:59.253 --> 47:01.453
You get it?

47:02.756 --> 47:04.590
C'est fini, motherfucker.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.659
Yo, there's four.

47:06.694 --> 47:08.394
I wish.

47:08.429 --> 47:10.796
No, there's f... I swallowed four.

47:11.699 --> 47:14.366
Petey? Four.

47:14.402 --> 47:17.202
So get it out of me, man.

47:17.237 --> 47:20.438
You get it out of
you, motherfucker. (laughs)

47:24.578 --> 47:27.045
Naz, relax.

47:27.081 --> 47:29.047
It's cool. It'll come.

47:32.586 --> 47:35.520
Nasir: What the fuck you looking at?

47:40.927 --> 47:43.060
<i>What was the question, again?</i>

47:43.096 --> 47:45.796
<i>What time it was when you
saw them, as you put it,</i>

47:45.832 --> 47:48.799
<i>"rubbing up against each other."</i>

47:48.835 --> 47:53.237
<i>I want to say 10,
11, something like that.</i>

47:53.272 --> 47:56.774
<i>- You were alone?
- Yeah.</i>

47:56.809 --> 48:00.244
(rewinding)

48:01.513 --> 48:05.315
<i>I want to say 10,
11, something like that.</i>

48:05.351 --> 48:09.319
<i>- You were alone?
- Yeah.</i>

48:11.056 --> 48:13.156
He's lying.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.911
How's it going?

48:37.315 --> 48:39.882
John Stone.

48:40.818 --> 48:42.451
Hey, I recognize you.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.320
You're the guy from the subway ads.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.199
- "No fee till you're free," right?
- That's me.

48:46.223 --> 48:49.825
Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. Hey, is that true?

48:49.860 --> 48:53.362
Not exactly, but my
rates are reasonable.

48:53.398 --> 48:56.999
Yeah, well, that's a good
one, man. That's a good slogan.

48:57.034 --> 48:58.867
Thank you.

49:00.004 --> 49:03.637
Here. You never know.

49:06.709 --> 49:11.545
Actually, you could,
uh, use one now... a lawyer.

49:11.580 --> 49:14.448
(scoffs) What the
fuck I need a lawyer for?

49:14.483 --> 49:17.819
Keep you out of jail for perjury.

49:17.854 --> 49:19.853
What you talking about, man?

49:19.888 --> 49:22.823
That couple you saw on the
street, you exchanged words with,

49:22.858 --> 49:25.793
something about "Mustafa, bombs," so on.

49:25.828 --> 49:27.260
All right, that's free speech.

49:27.296 --> 49:30.931
But you said you were
alone, that's not all right.

49:30.966 --> 49:33.767
That's a legal problem there.

49:33.803 --> 49:36.569
I'd look into this
problem for you, but I can't

49:36.604 --> 49:40.173
since I'm representing Mustafa.

49:40.209 --> 49:42.242
Trevor. Trevor.

49:42.277 --> 49:44.044
It is Trevor, am I right?

49:44.079 --> 49:46.213
I'm trying to help you here.

49:46.248 --> 49:49.227
Oh, you're trying to help me, with your
fucking rags and your gloves on, right?

49:49.251 --> 49:50.877
Seriously, who are you
supposed to be, Michael

49:50.901 --> 49:52.363
Jackson or Mickey Mouse
with those gloves?

49:52.387 --> 49:53.897
Don't worry about it. That's my problem.

49:53.921 --> 49:56.055
We need to talk about your problem.

49:56.090 --> 49:58.558
Hey, it's out of service.

49:58.593 --> 50:00.393
Who is he?

50:00.428 --> 50:03.295
Trevor, I know you were with someone.

50:03.331 --> 50:05.398
Hey, would you lower your voice, man?

50:05.433 --> 50:08.700
Okay? I don't know
him. I don't know the dude.

50:08.736 --> 50:11.414
You don't know him, but you were
walking down the street talking to him?

50:11.438 --> 50:13.638
I'm standing here talking to
you, and I don't know you.

50:13.674 --> 50:15.307
You know my name because I told you.

50:15.343 --> 50:16.942
He didn't tell you his? Come on.

50:16.978 --> 50:19.111
Nope. Nope, nope. I don't believe you.

50:19.146 --> 50:21.847
What the fuck do I
care? I just told you why.

50:21.883 --> 50:24.216
Your false statement was used
to get the indictment.

50:24.252 --> 50:27.652
That's five years and
$10,000 in New York, no shit.

50:27.688 --> 50:30.355
Look, man, seriously, what is
wrong with you to come down here

50:30.391 --> 50:33.492
and ask me to bang on a
brother in front of all these people?

50:33.527 --> 50:36.194
They can't hear us. Yeah,
but they can see us.

50:36.229 --> 50:40.399
Hey, if there's one thing I
don't look like, it's a cop.

50:40.434 --> 50:42.183
- Am I right?
- Yeah. You look

50:42.208 --> 50:44.269
like a fucking homeless dude.

50:44.304 --> 50:46.204
There you go!

50:59.652 --> 51:03.020
- Duane.
- Duane what?

51:03.055 --> 51:04.221
Don't know.

51:04.256 --> 51:06.557
- You're gonna lie to me now?
- Lie to you?

51:06.592 --> 51:10.661
I don't even want to be fucking
near you, whatever the fuck you got.

51:10.696 --> 51:13.263
It's not contagious.

51:14.633 --> 51:18.802
All right, so I'm all focused
on him right now,

51:18.837 --> 51:22.539
this Duane... whatever
the fuck his last name is.

51:22.574 --> 51:25.875
But I could just as easily focus on you,

51:25.911 --> 51:29.679
where you went after you
had this altercation

51:29.714 --> 51:33.282
outside a house two hours
later is covered in blood.

51:33.318 --> 51:35.318
- I went home.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:35.353 --> 51:36.512
I did.

51:36.537 --> 51:39.989
Trevor, after 9/11,
two things happened.

51:40.024 --> 51:42.358
You started calling guys "Abdul Fazul,"

51:42.393 --> 51:47.296
and Homeland Security started
putting up cameras everywhere.

51:47.332 --> 51:49.932
You didn't go home.

51:53.504 --> 51:55.871
You afraid of him?

51:57.141 --> 51:59.608
Is that what's going on here?

52:00.478 --> 52:03.145
Why are you afraid of him?

52:03.181 --> 52:05.747
He's a violent guy, this Duane?

52:10.955 --> 52:12.220
Reade.

52:12.255 --> 52:14.523
Reade?

52:14.558 --> 52:16.925
Duane Reade?

52:25.902 --> 52:27.935
All right.

52:27.971 --> 52:30.905
- I'll see you on the stand.
- What?

52:30.940 --> 52:33.608
Because you're a witness
in the murder case

52:33.643 --> 52:35.676
or you're a suspect in the murder case.

52:35.712 --> 52:37.778
We'll see which it is.

52:37.814 --> 52:39.825
What? I mean, that's his
name. What do you want from me?

52:39.849 --> 52:40.726
I didn't name him.

52:40.751 --> 52:43.017
It's a wild coincidence
the pharmacy's there?

52:43.052 --> 52:44.030
I didn't put it there.

52:44.055 --> 52:45.853
Duane Reade, you're
sticking with that?

52:45.889 --> 52:47.822
You're sure? Man, that's the truth.

52:47.857 --> 52:50.324
Fine. Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

52:50.359 --> 52:53.593
Like what? I don't know. Blow my mind.

52:55.697 --> 52:58.999
Next month, my great
grandmother will be 102.

53:03.205 --> 53:04.938
Wow.

53:05.841 --> 53:08.842
(thunder rumbles)

53:17.152 --> 53:21.320
Guess what. His name
really is Duane Reade.

53:21.356 --> 53:24.824
There's a warrant out on him
right now, and he's got a record:

53:24.860 --> 53:27.527
breaking and entering,
burglary, agg assault,
