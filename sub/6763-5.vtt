{\an1}Donna, I think
the mayor of Paris

01:46.314 --> 01:47.315
ought to give you
a key to the city.

01:47.398 --> 01:49.317
{\an3}For what?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.361
{\an1}For single-handedly reviving

01:53.112 --> 01:54.239
{\an3}I'm meeting Maggie
at Les Halles.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.366
{\an1}Well, I am shopped out.
Or at least my wallet is.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.494
{\an1}Buying Dylan's present left me

{\an1}My last couple
of days here

02:03.581 --> 02:06.417
{\an5}I want to soak up
as much of Paris
as I possibly can,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.711
which, if I stay outdoors,

I am not "quintessential,"

07:49.093 --> 07:50.386

07:50.469 --> 07:52.263
Oh, no, it's not bad
or anything.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.765
I mean, it just means
the, the, like, essence

07:54.849 --> 07:59.395
or the purest,
or most typical...

07:59.478 --> 07:59.812

08:06.444 --> 08:08.112
Now I'm speaking as badly

08:13.868 --> 08:15.828

08:15.912 --> 08:18.581
Ah...<i> mais oui!</i>

08:18.664 --> 08:22.585
Of course, it is more common
in the west part of France.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.295

to meet a girl

08:36.015 --> 08:39.059
Oh, yeah, well,

08:39.143 --> 08:40.394
and got dropped off up here,

08:40.477 --> 08:42.605
and, and I'm supposed
to stay at this hotel,

08:42.688 --> 08:44.273
but I have no clue

08:44.357 --> 08:47.109
how to find it.

08:47.193 --> 08:52.490
I believe that is in the student
quarter, right by my ho...

08:52.573 --> 08:53.908
where I live.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.452
{\an1}I will show you
on the map.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.162
Actually,
I have a better idea.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.499
Why don't you show me in person?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.960
I mean, if you're going
that way anyway.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.296
RICK:
London was cool, but they drive

09:07.380 --> 09:08.798
on the wrong side
of the street.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.133
{\an1}When I stepped off the curb,
I almost got killed.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.302
{\an3}At least then you would
not have to eat the food.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.345
That's true.

{\an1}and afterward we can take
a boat ride down the Seine...

09:34.699 --> 09:37.118
No, no, no,

just the places
you like best?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.630
I don't think so.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.798
{\an1}Why not?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.633
I'm only in town for two days.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.676
You don't want me
wandering around

native Parisian? You?

10:04.645 --> 10:07.815
Yes, me. I had him completely
fooled for over an hour today.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.900
I was great,
if I do say so myself.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.486
Bren, one or two hours
is one thing, but all day?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.363

to pull that off?

10:14.447 --> 10:17.867
I just talk like zees, and he
sinks that I am from Paree!

10:17.950 --> 10:20.202
Yeah? Why don't you offer to
sell him the Brooklyn Bridge?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.245
Or better yet,
Le Pont Neuf?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.664
{\an1}Maybe you can make a few bucks
while you're at it.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.249
Why don't you just
tell him the truth?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.125
Because it's fun.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.877
And I've gone too far
to go back now.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.504
{\an3}Besides, he might get
pretty mad at me.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.213
So what if he does?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.341
Donna, he's a really nice guy.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.176
I mean, he's easygoing.
He's fun.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.218
He's gonna be a writer.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.847

gather material, right?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.288
{\an1}That guy who was at
the Beach Club this morning.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.502
{\an1}I can't believe people
live like that.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.422
{\an3}Yeah, it's, it's
a real shame.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.798
Now can we get out of here?

11:55.881 --> 11:58.008
This isn't exactly the most
romantic spot on the beach.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.344
Or the safest.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.555
{\an3}Okay.
Okay.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.233
(knocking)

12:20.114 --> 12:21.615
Hi.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.117
{\an1}Hi.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.994
Can I come in?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.328
Yeah.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.457
Uh, you hungry?

12:29.540 --> 12:32.334
I've got a lot of leftovers.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.294
No. Thanks.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.337
I can't stay long.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.839
I just came by because I felt
really bad about something

12:36.922 --> 12:39.425
I said earlier at the club.

12:39.508 --> 12:43.345
{\an3}Do you want a cup of coffee
or something to drink, a soda?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.638
No, really.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.975
Uh, let me just say
what I came to say...

12:48.058 --> 12:50.227
which is...

12:52.897 --> 12:55.524
When I said that nothing
happened between us...

12:55.608 --> 12:57.776
{\an1}that it didn't
mean anything...

13:00.112 --> 13:03.866
It's just that I don't want
what we did

13:03.949 --> 13:06.076
to get in the way of real life.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.204
Kelly, everything is real to me.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.372
You know what I'm talking about.

13:10.456 --> 13:10.998
You're talking about us.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.375
There is no "us."

13:13.459 --> 13:16.045
{\an3}So, why did you
have to come here

13:16.128 --> 13:19.548
{\an3}and tell me this
in person?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.511
Because I wanted to see you.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.096
Good. At least you admit it.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.767
Yeah... I admit it.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.310
I can't just kiss a guy

13:31.393 --> 13:32.937
{\an1}I've had a major crush on
my whole life

13:33.020 --> 13:36.941
and pretend that it
doesn't mean anything.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.152
I just don't know what.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.738
About that we like each other?

13:42.821 --> 13:47.826
How about...
we were both feeling lonely

13:47.910 --> 13:51.205
and we went a little too far?

13:51.288 --> 13:53.916
I don't think you mean that.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.137
Dylan...

14:07.221 --> 14:09.557
what are we going to do?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.151
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Bren, are you sure</i>
<i>you don't want to come with us?</i>

14:21.235 --> 14:22.987
Hey, let her have some fun
with her Monsieur Rick.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.113
We won't wait up.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.948
{\an1}Good idea.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.116
Brenda!

14:27.199 --> 14:28.951
Donna, I'm kidding.
(phone ringing)

14:29.034 --> 14:31.620
<i>A bientôt!</i>

14:32.830 --> 14:33.914
Bonjour?

14:33.998 --> 14:35.124
{\an1}<i>Ah, c'est dommage,</i>
<i>elle a parti a ce moment!</i>

14:35.207 --> 14:37.001
{\an1}Do you wish to speak
to her roommate?

14:37.084 --> 14:41.297
{\an1}Donna, they are
asking for Brenda.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.339
Hello?

14:42.423 --> 14:44.592
Donna.
<i>Comment vas-tu?</i>

14:44.675 --> 14:47.136
Dylan, hi.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.430
Uh,<i> très bien, merci. Et tu?</i>

14:49.513 --> 14:51.307
Ah,<i> jes oui</i> hangin' out.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.016
Where's Bren?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.142
Went sightseeing.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.978
Bright and early, huh?

14:56.061 --> 14:56.478
Why didn't you go?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.647
I'm going shopping.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.358
Priorities, I see.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
So, who did she go with?

15:03.027 --> 15:06.989
She left here all by herself.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.701
I just kinda wanted to hear
her voice right now, you know.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.995
Well, I'll tell her you called.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.998
Don't.
She'll just... you know her.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.792
She'll try and call me back
and I'll probably be asleep.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.838
How's she doin'?

15:22.921 --> 15:24.006
Great, great.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.467
Uh, I know she's really looking
forward to coming home.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.509
Yeah, me, too.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.678
Bye, Donna.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.022
<i>Merci.</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:42.024
You're welcome.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.027
Oh, here, come here.
Here's a good spot.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.862
{\an3}Stand in front
of this fountain.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.698
{\an5}(with French accent):
Rick, you have taken
an entire roll of film

15:49.782 --> 15:51.075
{\an3}and all the pictures
are of me!

15:51.158 --> 15:52.242
So? It's my camera, isn't it?

15:52.326 --> 15:57.373
{\an3}Can we continue on
with the tour, monsieur?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.083
{\an1}But of course.
Thank you.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.922
{\an1}Steve, did you listen
to my tape yet?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.298
I told you I'd get to it.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.677
{\an4}Well, all you have to do
is listen to it in the car
on your way home.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
{\an3}What is it
with you and this tape?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.263
{\an1}You've gotta know some people
in the music business.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.557
{\an5}I mean, your mom has
to know some people.
All right.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.267
I'll listen to your tape.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.560
{\an3}But if you want to get
into show business,

16:18.644 --> 16:21.271
there's one rule which is more
important than anything else.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.023
Well, what's that?

16:23.107 --> 16:26.485
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.405
{\an5}ANDREA:
<i>You're gonna be</i>
<i>the best kite flyer.</i>

16:29.488 --> 16:31.198
You just have to keep
practicing, right?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.908
{\an3}And don't...
when you run...

16:32.991 --> 16:34.910
You just gotta run fast.
Andrea, Andrea, Andrea.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.246
Okay, ready?
Okay, let's go.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.123
Look.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.420
Whoa, hey, hey.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.921
{\an1}Hey, let out
some more line.

16:46.004 --> 16:46.296
You're choking her.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.924
Thanks.

16:49.007 --> 16:52.010
I taught my kid to fly a kite
on a day just like this.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.432
Go ahead.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.267
{\an1}Do you want me
to go get Henry?

17:03.230 --> 17:04.440
No.

17:04.522 --> 17:05.941
Hey, what's your name, man?

17:06.023 --> 17:07.483
Jack Canner.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.194
Brandon Walsh.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.954
Listen, uh, I don't mean
to stick my nose in

17:19.038 --> 17:20.455
where it's not wanted, but

17:20.539 --> 17:23.459
how'd a guy like you wind up
on the street anyway?

17:23.541 --> 17:25.252
Let's just say
I walked in off the desert.

17:25.335 --> 17:29.965
{\an3}Yeah, forget it.
I didn't mean to intrude.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.259
{\an1}Hey,

17:32.342 --> 17:35.304
I didn't buy this jacket
in an army surplus store, chief.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.683
You're a vet?

17:41.602 --> 17:44.188
Yeah, Marine Reserves.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.523
Pride of Desert Storm.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.149
You were stationed
in the Middle East?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.360
That's right.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.363
And while I was over there
serving our country,

17:53.447 --> 17:54.281
my life back here fell apart,
you know.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.533
You lost your job?

17:57.409 --> 18:01.622
My job, my wife,

18:01.705 --> 18:04.458
my kids, my house.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.836
I don't get it.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.296
I thought the government was
supposed to take care of people

18:09.379 --> 18:12.466
who fight for
our country.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.551
Yeah, well, there's
a recession on, kid.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.345
Uncle Sam can't force companies
to stay in business

18:16.428 --> 18:18.180
or hire vets.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.181
What kind of work did you do?

18:19.264 --> 18:22.851
I was an engineer.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.478
So, if you could get a job,
you'd work, right?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.855
Well, of course I would.
Why?

18:26.939 --> 18:30.526
I've got some friends
in low places.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.360
I'll see what I can do.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.029
Forget it, Walsh.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.823
Henry, the guy was
in Desert Storm.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.824
He hasn't worked in months.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.243
Walsh, I was in the
Marines too, okay.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.203
{\an3}I've heard all those
hard-luck stories before.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.372
Guys hiding behind the flag

18:43.455 --> 18:44.915
{\an3}looking for some kind
of handout.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.250
He doesn't want a handout.
He needs a job.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.836
What makes him think
I've got one for him?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.712
Come on. You told me yourself
you're going to hire

18:50.796 --> 18:52.172
a clean-up crew
after we close next week.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.215
I've got everybody I need.
I'm sorry.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.676
Just meet him, Henry.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.469
Give him a chance.
That's all I ask.

19:01.807 --> 19:07.104
{\an3}Last but not least, we have
this very famous park

19:07.187 --> 19:10.315
where American college students
pretend they are lost

19:10.399 --> 19:12.067
and try to pick up the girls.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.402
(laughing)

19:13.485 --> 19:16.738
{\an1}Seriously though,
it is quite beautiful.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.908
{\an1}You could... you could
fall in love here.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.076
You could.

19:21.159 --> 19:24.538
{\an5}Brenda, this has been
the most wonderful day.
Shh.

19:24.621 --> 19:25.956
You will spoil it.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.710
{\an1}At least you admit there is
something to be spoiled.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.966
So, tell me, do you have
many French boyfriends?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.467
{\an3}I don't have any
French boyfriends.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.387
I find that hard to believe.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.764
Well...

19:42.848 --> 19:46.768
{\an3}I've always had a thing
for American guys.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.896
{\an1}Have you ever been
to the States?

19:48.979 --> 19:49.313
<i>Oui.</i>

19:49.396 --> 19:51.982
<i>Oui?</i> Where?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.984
Where?
<i>Oui!</i> Where?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.986
Or should I say,<i> "ou"?</i>

19:56.069 --> 19:57.321
<i>Ou, oui!</i>

19:57.404 --> 20:00.115
Why do I get the feeling you are
trying to avoid my question?

20:00.198 --> 20:03.911
Ah, um...

20:03.994 --> 20:05.495
I have relatives in Minnesota.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.248
No kidding!

20:08.332 --> 20:09.833
I mean that's not far
from Madison.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.627
I mean it's not like
right next door,

20:11.710 --> 20:13.086
{\an1}but it's a lot
closer than here.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.421
Anyplace else?

20:14.504 --> 20:17.966
Also, uh, California.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.968
I love California.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.763
I'm thinking of transferring
to UCLA myself.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.848
I mean, I love the Midwest.
I just...

20:24.932 --> 20:25.474
I hate the winters.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.769
I know what you mean.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.812
I mean, I can imagine.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.982
Brenda, would you go
to dinner with me?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.943
<i>Absolument.</i>

20:36.026 --> 20:38.904
Being a tour guide, it
works up the appetite.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.492
Come on, lazy one.
We gotta take a drive.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.827
{\an1}What?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.872
I know such a better way
to spend a hot summer day

20:48.956 --> 20:51.166
{\an1}than sitting here
toasting in the sun. Come on.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.883
You having fun?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.218
Yes.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.178
All right.
Go faster!

21:04.137 --> 21:07.140
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

21:10.894 --> 21:12.020
You okay?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.397
Yes.
Yeah?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.528
Oh, my God, that
was so amazing.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.654
{\an1}It was just like being
on a roller coaster.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.531
Hey, any time you want to go
again, you just let me know.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.242
Aren't you forgetting we're
going to turn into a pumpkin

21:25.325 --> 21:26.368
in a couple of days?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.703
No, I'm not forgetting.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.246
But we're not doing
anything wrong, Kel.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.914
We're just having fun.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.748
So far, we've kissed
each other in,

21:31.832 --> 21:33.709
in your living room,
in my cabana,

21:33.792 --> 21:34.501
and when we got
in the water today.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.920
So, are you making a list?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.755
There's another one.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.965
You're crazy.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.551
Hey, I've been accused of worse.

21:52.936 --> 21:55.897
So Brenda, why don't you ever
want to talk about your family?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.693
{\an3}I have to keep
some secrets, don't I?

21:59.776 --> 22:02.446
{\an1}Well, you've told me all
about the history of Paris.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.574
Now I want to know about the
history of Mademoiselle DuBois.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.867
Who?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.745
Oh, right. Me.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.913
You are so funny.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.248
{\an1}Are you the comedian
in your family

22:13.331 --> 22:15.876
{\an1}or are your parents
like this, too?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.045
My father is an accountant,

22:18.128 --> 22:23.425
and lately he has about as much
sense of humor as this table.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.926
Ooh, sore spot, eh?

22:25.010 --> 22:25.927
Trouble <i> avec papa?</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:26.928
We do not...

22:27.012 --> 22:29.931
how do you say,

22:30.015 --> 22:32.309
see eye to eye.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.935
That happens.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.937
{\an1}I have two older sisters,
so I've seen it.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.230
Usually over "guy" stuff.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.565
Am I right?

22:38.648 --> 22:40.609
Dad didn't like your boyfriend?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.614
So is he still in the picture?

22:45.697 --> 22:46.782
Oui.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.241
Very much so.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.119
Yet you haven't mentioned him
all this time. Why is that?

22:51.203 --> 22:54.581
You deedn't ask me.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.834
You're right. I deedn't.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.669
<i>Alors,</i> shall we go?

22:59.753 --> 23:03.131
{\an4}So, tomorrow, I thought
maybe we could...
Rick.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.301
I told you. Tomorrow
you are on your own.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.512
Ow, come on. You haven't
finished teaching me

23:08.595 --> 23:09.930
about the local customs yet.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.765
What do you want to learn?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.850
Well, like that, for instance.

23:13.934 --> 23:18.146
{\an1}You know, the kissing
on the cheek thing.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.272
I'm serious. I mean,

23:19.356 --> 23:21.691
{\an1}is there a technique,
or do you just wing it?

23:21.775 --> 23:24.152
There is nothing to it.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.113
Then why don't you
want to teach me?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.615
All right.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.702
Yeah, uh...

23:32.786 --> 23:34.788
Go like this...

23:37.415 --> 23:38.583
And like this...

23:41.753 --> 23:43.171
So, that's how you kiss, huh?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.674
No.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.260
This is how I kiss.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.977
So what should I wear
to dinner tonight?

23:57.060 --> 23:59.062
{\an3}Casual? Dressy?
Whips and chains?

23:59.146 --> 24:02.023
You know, we don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.526
{\an3}Don't worry.
Parents <i> always</i> love me.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.321
{\an1}Okay, but I'm gonna be a
little late picking you up.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.114
Why?

24:09.197 --> 24:11.158
Well, you remember
that homeless guy

24:11.241 --> 24:12.534
we saw on the beach yesterday?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.536
I got him a job interview
with Henry.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.580
{\an3}What makes you think
he wants a job?

24:16.663 --> 24:18.248
Because he told me he did.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.501
What?

24:21.585 --> 24:24.713
Brandon, guys like that
are hustlers.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.381
They'll say anything to
get enough spare change

24:26.464 --> 24:27.757
{\an3}so they can go out and
get another jug of wine.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.759
Canner's not like that.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.635
What are you trying to do,
save the world?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.971
No. I'm not trying
to save the world.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.306
I'm just trying
to help out one guy

24:34.389 --> 24:34.890
who's had a run of bad luck.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.475
You're so idealistic.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.643
So?

24:40.103 --> 24:44.107
{\an3}So, who knew you'd turn out
to be such a soft touch?

24:46.359 --> 24:48.028
Didn't anyone tell you?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.779
I'm the nicest guy in America.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.948
Just do me a favor.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.450
{\an1}What?

24:53.533 --> 24:55.118
Watch your wallet.

24:59.164 --> 25:04.586
(music playing)

25:04.669 --> 25:05.837
Steve.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.047
Steve! Hello.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.049
Would you please
turn that down?

25:09.132 --> 25:10.425
It's bad enough
I have to listen

25:10.508 --> 25:12.219
{\an1}to David playing that garbage
all day and night.

25:12.302 --> 25:12.761
Then this really
is David's music?

25:12.844 --> 25:15.305
Why would anybody lie

25:15.388 --> 25:16.723
{\an1}about something that
sounds like that?

25:16.806 --> 25:19.309
This is great!

25:19.392 --> 25:22.062
I mean, yeah, it is a little
rough around the edges.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.772
And the beginning,
and the middle and the end.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.024
Yeah, well,
everybody's a critic.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.276
Listen, uh... do you know
where he is?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.486
I don't know.
He's probably at home.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.280
Don't tell him
I said anything, okay?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.913
What was that about?

25:39.996 --> 25:41.081
Beats me.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.292
It's just cleanup
and stuff,

25:44.376 --> 25:46.461
{\an3}but it should be steady
work for a few weeks.

25:46.544 --> 25:48.463
Well, that sounds great.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.798
So, just come to the
club in the morning,

25:49.881 --> 25:54.970
{\an3}and, uh, ask for me, and
I'll introduce you to Henry.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.471
Thanks, man.

25:56.554 --> 25:57.973
{\an3}Yeah, well,
you're a war hero.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.975
You deserve a break.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.434
Oh, yeah.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.311
Real heroic.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.524
Are you saying
you really never were

26:07.607 --> 26:08.692
in the Persian Gulf?

26:10.068 --> 26:12.279
Hell, man, I was
on the front lines.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.531
I was in the
elite corps.

26:14.614 --> 26:17.492
I was ready to lay down my life

26:17.575 --> 26:19.995
to teach Saddam Hussein
a lesson he'd never forget,

26:20.078 --> 26:21.830
but his troops went
running back to Baghdad

26:21.913 --> 26:23.373
before he ever got started.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.249
I sat in that
lousy desert

26:24.332 --> 26:27.502
six months waiting
to be called home

26:27.585 --> 26:28.712
while my wife moved out
and filed for divorce.

26:28.795 --> 26:29.838
I'm sorry.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.799
Well, it wasn't so bad.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.384
I got to march in a parade.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.221
Listen, I really
appreciate everything

26:38.305 --> 26:39.597
you're trying to do
for me, dude.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.557
I really do.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.975
It's no problem.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.184
See you

26:43.268 --> 26:43.810
in the morning, Jack.

26:43.893 --> 26:44.936
Sure thing.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.030
That feels really good.

26:55.113 --> 26:55.989
{\an3}What are you doing
tomorrow night?

26:56.072 --> 26:56.823
{\an3}You want to go
to Paradise Cove?

26:56.906 --> 26:59.034
Camp out under the stars?

26:59.117 --> 26:59.701
I can't do that.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.078
Sure, you can.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.038
Two sleeping bags.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.414
{\an3}No fooling around,
I promise.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.207
Then why bother?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.752
I mean it.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.253
{\an3}Have you ever camped
under the stars?

27:10.337 --> 27:12.213
{\an3}No.
Well,

27:12.297 --> 27:14.549
it's really beautiful up there.

27:14.632 --> 27:15.925
It's just far enough
outside the city

27:16.009 --> 27:17.010
where you don't see anything,

27:17.093 --> 27:19.763
but you can see a shooting star
every two minutes.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.433
Stop it. You're tempting me.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.434
So, let's go.

27:24.517 --> 27:28.021
I mean, we can get away.
We can talk.

27:28.104 --> 27:30.023
Kel, we might be able
to figure out

27:30.106 --> 27:31.066
what we've been doing the last

27:31.149 --> 27:32.776
couple of weeks.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.235
Dylan, I know what
we've been doing.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.236
That's why I can't go.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.947
Okay.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.908
But you are missing my cooking.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.452
You missed a spot--

27:42.535 --> 27:43.536
right there.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.537
Here?

27:44.621 --> 27:45.622
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.293
I meant put
aloe on it.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.087
{\an1}I didn't mean
for you to kiss it.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.963
Oh. Was I kissing?

27:54.047 --> 27:56.007
Did I kiss?

27:56.091 --> 27:58.051
I'm sorry.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.053
You're bad.

28:00.136 --> 28:02.555
I know.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.807
You know.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.393
Everybody knows.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.440
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.983
I didn't know you were in here.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.026
David! Wait!

28:15.110 --> 28:16.611
It's not what you think! David!

28:17.987 --> 28:18.947
This is not good.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.158
You gotta go
talk to him, Kel.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.244
What do you want me to say?

28:24.327 --> 28:25.537
Dylan, we can't

28:25.620 --> 28:26.996
{\an1}do this anymore.
We're being stupid.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.958
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.085
Somebody we both love.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.975
Brenda, it's 2:00
in the morning.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.184
It is?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.310
Another half an hour

28:49.394 --> 28:49.978
and I would've called in
the gendarmes.

28:50.061 --> 28:54.149
You sound like my father.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.984
{\an3}Well, I hope you had
a very good time.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.653
Yeah, I did.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.156
Uh-oh.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.325
It was just too hard
to say good-bye.

29:04.409 --> 29:09.164
But... you <i> did</i> say
good-bye, right?

29:09.247 --> 29:11.499
No.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.001
Oh, Brenda.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.669
Look, I would've
been back sooner,

29:14.752 --> 29:16.129
but he insisted
I meet him again

29:16.212 --> 29:18.214
and he wouldn't let me leave
until I agreed.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.883
But our closing ceremonies
are tomorrow,

29:19.966 --> 29:21.134
and our good-bye party.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.635
I know, I know.

29:22.719 --> 29:23.970
Look, I'll just stand him up.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.013
It'll be better that way.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.015
Come on, Bren.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.058
30 hours from now

29:29.142 --> 29:30.393
you'll be on the plane,
heading home

29:30.477 --> 29:30.894
to the love of your life.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.574
Donna?

29:47.076 --> 29:49.037
Do you ever wonder
if there's somebody in the world

29:49.120 --> 29:51.080
that you were meant to meet...

29:53.082 --> 29:57.921
and then by chance or some
weird twist of fate, you don't?

29:58.004 --> 30:01.799
And you miss out
on your true destiny?

30:01.883 --> 30:05.220
What on earth
are you talking about?

30:06.012 --> 30:08.097
I don't know. Never mind.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.974
Look, Bren.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.894
You've been missing Dylan
all summer

30:12.977 --> 30:16.731
and this guy just touched off
all your feelings for him.

30:16.814 --> 30:19.192
Yeah. I'm sure that's it.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.902
I'm sure it is.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.070
Good night, Bren.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.071
Good night, Donna.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.704
Everything
was wonderful.

30:31.788 --> 30:32.705
Well, thank you.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.581
It has been a
real pleasure

30:33.665 --> 30:35.416
{\an3}talking to somebody
from back home.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.417
{\an1}Mmm, yeah.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.211
{\an1}Suddenly I'm
getting nostalgic

30:38.294 --> 30:39.921
for wind chill factors

30:40.004 --> 30:41.089
and the mosquitoes
at Lake Minnetonka.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.925
You went to Lake Minnetonka,
too? So did we.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.927
Well, everybody did.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.929
Well, everybody
who's anybody.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.265
So, tell me something.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.183
Which one of you
does Brandon

30:52.267 --> 30:54.102
get his idealism from?
Brooke.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.979
Uh... why do you ask?

30:56.062 --> 30:57.105
{\an1}Oh, well, didn't
he tell you?

30:57.188 --> 30:59.357
He's single-handedly solving

30:59.440 --> 31:00.942
{\an1}the nation's
unemployment problem.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.611
I just helped a guy get a job
interview today, that's all.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.612
A homeless guy.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.030
Really?

31:06.114 --> 31:06.990
Good for you.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.075
Listen, if you
think I'm bad,

31:09.158 --> 31:10.785
wait till you meet
my sister, Brenda.

31:10.868 --> 31:11.786
Who's managed to bring home

31:11.869 --> 31:13.454
<i>every</i> stray dog
in every neighborhood

31:13.538 --> 31:14.414
we've ever lived in.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.749
{\an1}Well, here's nothing wrong
with helping others

31:16.833 --> 31:18.293
{\an1}as long as they
want to be helped.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.132
{\an1}Hi, there.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.133
Hey, David. Um,

31:25.216 --> 31:27.302
look, I want to
explain about...

31:27.385 --> 31:28.970
{\an1}No, you don't have
to explain anything.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.681
I just want you to know that
your secret is safe with me.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.516
David, it's really
not what you think.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.143
Well, I'm sure it isn't.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.519
For your information,

31:36.603 --> 31:38.313
Dylan was just putting lotion
on my back, okay?

<i>Au revoir.</i>

42:14.740 --> 42:16.909
<i>Au revoir.</i>

42:16.992 --> 42:19.328
{\an3}Oh, you girls have
been my favorite

42:19.411 --> 42:20.955
of all the students.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.623
Oh, you say that
to all the girls.

42:22.706 --> 42:23.749
But this time, I mean it.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.794
{\an1}The bus is here.
All aboard!

42:26.877 --> 42:30.464
I gotta hand it to you, Bren,
that guy was a real find.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.174
{\an1}If he asked me
to go backpacking

42:32.258 --> 42:33.801
{\an6}on the Riviera,
you'd be seeing
my tracks right now.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.471
You okay?

42:37.554 --> 42:38.806
Donna, I can't stand the thought

42:38.889 --> 42:40.140
of Rick standing there
all alone,

42:40.224 --> 42:41.475
expecting me to show up.

42:41.558 --> 42:44.436
Oh, Bren, he'll find
some other nice girl real soon

42:44.520 --> 42:45.312
that'll teach him French.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.439
{\an1}I have to say good-bye.
Brenda!

42:47.523 --> 42:49.358
The bus is leaving
in 20 minutes.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.651
You said if you ever
saw him again

42:50.734 --> 42:52.319
that you'd never want
to leave him.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.280
What if he talks you
into going with him?

42:57.533 --> 42:59.034
Brenda!

43:15.926 --> 43:17.594
Rick!

43:45.622 --> 43:47.124
Who ordered the pizza?

43:47.207 --> 43:49.501
Hi.

43:49.585 --> 43:50.878
{\an3}Hi.

43:50.961 --> 43:53.589
{\an3}Thought you
might be hungry.

43:53.672 --> 43:55.841
{\an1}Yeah, of all the beaches
in all the towns

43:55.924 --> 43:58.844
{\an1}in all the world,
she walks into mine.

43:58.927 --> 44:03.265
{\an3}I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.559
{\an1}I do.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.395
{\an3}Yeah, then why don't
you tell me.

44:08.479 --> 44:12.649
Because you know that this
is probably the last chance

44:12.733 --> 44:15.110
{\an1}that we'll ever have
to be alone like this.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.907
Wow, you were right.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.368
Look at all those stars.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.913
Did you see that?
It was a shooting star.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.456
{\an3}You saw that?
Yes.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.249
Wow, that was so beautiful.

44:29.333 --> 44:34.213
You know what they say
about shooting stars...

44:34.296 --> 44:37.383
{\an1}you can't share 'em
with a friend.

44:37.466 --> 44:40.344
{\an3}Well, I guess they weren't
talking about us.
