<i>My father was a man
who didn't talk much.</i>

00:33.409 --> 00:36.037
<i>The only thing he taught me</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:38.622
<i>was that everybody's
on their own here.</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:41.375
<i>You learn it here naturally.</i>

00:42.251 --> 00:46.047
<i>I didn't manage to teach
even that to my sons.</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:48.632
<i>They had to do without.</i>

01:12.323 --> 01:14.241
Three beers.

02:08.086 --> 02:12.007
<i>I did a lot of bad things
before I became a cop.</i>

02:12.466 --> 02:15.803
<i>Things you keep quiet about.</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:18.305
<i>But the only thing I regret</i>

02:18.389 --> 02:22.351
<i>is that I never knew
how to be a father.</i>

02:22.434 --> 02:26.480
<i>...3000 cubic meters
of firewood yearly.</i>

02:26.564 --> 02:31.152
<i>The number of visitors
is judged by firewood use</i>

02:31.235 --> 02:34.363
<i>and different guest and log books.</i>

02:34.446 --> 02:36.949
FOR INSOMNIA

02:37.032 --> 02:39.618
<i>Two bears were felled
in Lapland on Monday.</i>

02:39.702 --> 02:44.915
<i>The first felling of the season was
made in Muonio, south of Kihlanki</i>

02:44.999 --> 02:47.126
<i>where a male bear was felled.</i>

02:47.209 --> 02:51.463
<i>In Salla near the Russian border
a female bear was felled.</i>

03:01.182 --> 03:06.061
Kuntonen. You'll never
believe who's sitting here.

03:06.562 --> 03:09.315
Tell <i>me.
Jaakko.</i>

03:09.481 --> 03:13.360
<i>The killer who strangled
his stepdad some years ago.</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:18.741
<i>He's</i> out <i>of</i> prison <i>already?
It sure looks like it.</i>

03:21.160 --> 03:23.662
What's he doing?
Sitting.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.752
<i>Let him</i> sit. <i>What if he
and his friends cause trouble?</i>

03:47.102 --> 03:49.939
Get up, man!

05:00.301 --> 05:02.303
They didn't do anything.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.433
I'm sure they did something.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.352
They had a couple of beers,
paid and left.

05:54.313 --> 06:02.905
LAW OF THE LAND

06:42.653 --> 06:45.447
Now the reindeer
can run free again.

06:50.035 --> 06:55.165
500?
For one man. There's two of us.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.963
Give us a thousand
and we'll call it even.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.801
A thousand is too much.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.519
We tracked it for two days.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.647
Give us what you promised.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.115
My sister asked you
to come see her.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.410
I'll be there when I have time.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.079
Elmeri's always asking about you.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.338
Is that your dad's car?

08:27.049 --> 08:30.552
Lasse Kuntonen's car.
In the middle of the woods...

08:31.762 --> 08:36.265
Should we check if he's inside?
Why would he be?

08:36.725 --> 08:39.311
I'm sure he's gotten out.

08:39.645 --> 08:43.482
Should we make sure he's not inside?
We don't have time.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.493
Just a little accident.

09:03.502 --> 09:07.548
You were supposed to work until
the end of next month, right?

09:09.174 --> 09:11.760
Your post will be terminated.

09:11.885 --> 09:16.098
The nearest police station
will be in the neighboring county.

09:16.974 --> 09:20.227
Everybody knows that by now.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.776
You're right.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.868
What are you going to do?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.208
I'll take my stuff and go.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.274
What are you going to do now?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.246
You should take care of yourself.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.708
Why?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.929
Thanks for lunch.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.807
I'll go shovel snow for you.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.521
Don't go anywhere.

10:46.605 --> 10:50.651
There's one thing you need
to know about Lasse Kuntonen.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.697
Lasse Kuntonen, the cop?
What about him?

10:56.657 --> 10:59.701
<i>Citizens have learned
not to call the police.</i>

10:59.785 --> 11:02.788
<i>They know the police are
busy and won't come.</i>

11:02.871 --> 11:05.040
<i>People in remote areas suffer...</i>

11:05.165 --> 11:08.460
There's someone standing
in our yard.

11:14.132 --> 11:18.762
Huh? There's a man
standing in our yard.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.938
Is it a tourist?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.819
Goddammit, is that Jaakko?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.571
What does he want from us?

11:46.164 --> 11:48.709
What do you want?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.673
I want to talk to your clad.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.969
He doesn't live here anymore.

11:59.386 --> 12:04.057
I just wanted to talk.
I haven't talked to him in ages.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.310
You should take off.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.273
Take off, for fuck's sake.

12:24.453 --> 12:30.208
What do they want? No idea.
They asked about Lasse.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.295
Should we call Lasse
and ask him to come around?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.547
Put the gun away.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.134
And tell him what?
That there was someone in our yard?

12:39.217 --> 12:43.346
He's a convicted killer.
You can call the police for that.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.603
We're not calling anyone.
Did you lock the door?

12:49.686 --> 12:52.230
They're not coming back.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.244
What are the dogs barking at?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.960
Go check!

13:19.716 --> 13:22.010
Wake UP!

13:22.093 --> 13:24.888
Erkki! Are you here?

13:26.389 --> 13:29.434
You were pretty rude earlier.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.020
What are you doing here? Out!

13:32.103 --> 13:36.233
I have unfinished business with
the shotgun warrior. Get out!

13:36.358 --> 13:40.070
I need to ask a couple of questions
about Lasse Kuntonen. Out!

13:40.237 --> 13:42.781
Put the gun away.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.574
Stop!

14:03.301 --> 14:05.387
Erkki, don't go there.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.724
Come back.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.821
Hey!

15:13.455 --> 15:16.458
There was a shooting
at the Syväjärvi house.

16:08.093 --> 16:12.514
Anybody home? It's me, Lasse.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.495
It's me, Lasse.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.704
What happened?
I wrestled with a cop.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.415
They peppersprayed me.

17:20.540 --> 17:25.420
What happened? It took them
three fuckin' hours to get here.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.214
I lost it.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.426
I guess you're not
interested in working,

17:31.509 --> 17:34.179
since they sent cops
all the way from town.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.807
My post was terminated.
When?

17:38.641 --> 17:40.810
Yesterday.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.273
That's just fucking great.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.742
What are you going to do?
Nothing.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.412
Don't do anything stupid.
I won't.

17:59.537 --> 18:03.666
I mean it.
I said I won't.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.672
The police can take care of it.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.433
Jaakko took Tuomo's gun.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.312
We'll get it back.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.067
Tuomo's in intensive care.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.236
He'll make it.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.157
I don't know about that.

18:36.241 --> 18:39.661
He was shot in the lungs
with an elk rifle.

18:40.370 --> 18:44.415
Tuomo's a tough guy;
he's not going to die.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.969
I'll wait in the kitchen.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.143
I'll take care of Jaakko.
He asked about you.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.020
Who?
Jaakko.

19:06.938 --> 19:11.484
He came by last night
and asked about you. Why?

19:14.696 --> 19:18.366
I guess he thought
I still live here.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.035
I doubt it.

19:39.971 --> 19:43.183
Who is this handsome little guy?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.643
He's Elmeri.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.064
Nice name.
Thank you.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.528
Why don't we talk.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.094
What does your dad want?

20:22.472 --> 20:24.515
I don't know.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.804
(In Swedish:)
Are you on patrol here?

21:02.887 --> 21:05.556
The police want
to increase readiness.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.768
You're not from around here,
are you?

21:08.893 --> 21:10.979
Your face isn't familiar to me.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.817
I know who you are,
by name and reputation.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.698
Whose car is that?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.953
It's mine.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.833
You drive two cars?

21:36.754 --> 21:39.257
Since when has
the Border Guard been

21:39.340 --> 21:43.094
responsible for customs duties?
Since now.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.972
Okay. Bye.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.007
<i>He picked up the scent.</i>

22:22.717 --> 22:24.927
<i>It's coming your way.</i>

22:27.180 --> 22:29.557
<i>Do you read me?</i>

22:30.266 --> 22:32.310
<i>Erkki?</i>

22:33.936 --> 22:35.938
<i>Erkki!</i>

23:56.144 --> 23:58.062
Inkeri.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.949
I thought you might drop by.

24:10.491 --> 24:15.997
Are you alone?
That's none of your business.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.920
Is Jaakko here?

24:27.758 --> 24:30.470
He's in trouble
but not because of me.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.703
I told him about you.

24:56.037 --> 24:59.332
Who?
I told Jaakko you're his father.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.727
I have cancer.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.398
I've got less than a year.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.945
I didn't want to lie
on your behalf anymore.

25:31.989 --> 25:35.493
Jaakko will have no one.
He has the right to know.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.795
You have to protect Jaakko.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.842
I don't know
if I'll be able to anymore.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.776
He's your son.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.739
You owe it to him.

26:15.449 --> 26:19.412
What did Lasse say to you?
When?

26:20.580 --> 26:24.542
When you were in our yard talking.
I saw you.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.462
He told me to take you hunting

26:29.046 --> 26:31.549
and keep you here
for a couple of days.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.760
Why?

26:39.724 --> 26:42.727
Maybe he doesn't want
you to go after Jaakko.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.983
He knew you wouldn't let this lie.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.528
Why the hell
is he worried about it?

27:24.143 --> 27:28.356
You left a message.
Wait in the restaurant.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.402
I'll put you to bed.

27:52.672 --> 27:56.926
That boy.
Elmeri.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.639
Is he Erkki's?

28:04.100 --> 28:07.019
Yes. Erkki didn't want to tell you.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.031
What mess have you
dragged him into?

28:19.115 --> 28:23.577
Showing up in his life
after all these years.

28:24.704 --> 28:29.166
You don't know me.
So, what do you want from him?

28:31.085 --> 28:35.047
Nothing. I'm trying to help him.

28:39.677 --> 28:42.847
What do those men want?
What men?

28:42.930 --> 28:46.892
A couple of Swedes came by,
asking about you.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.479
They gave me the creeps.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.453
What is it?

29:52.208 --> 29:54.710
Tuomo is dead.

29:56.921 --> 30:02.384
Mom called from the hospital.
They couldn't save him.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.222
What happened?

30:08.432 --> 30:13.103
I already told you. Tuomo's dead.

30:14.939 --> 30:18.818
A couple of hours ago.
His body just gave out.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.168
Come play with me.

31:22.923 --> 31:27.386
Uncle Lasse doesn't have time
to play, but Mommy does.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.694
Did you find Jaakko?

31:49.491 --> 31:53.245
Not yet. But I will.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.791
I want to come with you.

32:00.878 --> 32:04.131
It's best we let
the situation calm down.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.429
So you've done nothing about it?

32:34.203 --> 32:36.747
Are you just going to sit there?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.960
They won't find him.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.881
What if they do?
They won't.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.884
How do you know?

32:52.763 --> 32:55.182
Believe me, I know.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.536
(In Swedish:)
Gunnar asked about you.

33:57.619 --> 34:01.498
I saw him
at the border crossing point.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.632
They're after Jaakko, right?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.679
Who's paying him?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.766
Half the village.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.687
Is there a lynching going on?
Maybe.

34:24.521 --> 34:27.858
Were you thinking of doing
something about it?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.237
You're on your own with this.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.891
A cup of coffee, please.

35:19.409 --> 35:22.579
How much is it?
That's okay.

35:24.081 --> 35:29.336
No, I'll pay. I'm no thief.

35:50.190 --> 35:54.444
Wouldn't it be polite to smile
in your line of work?

35:54.528 --> 35:57.614
What?
You heard me.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.595
You mumble like that
to all your customers?

36:19.678 --> 36:22.181
No wonder
you don't have any.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.977
Cindy. That's your name?

36:27.060 --> 36:30.147
That's what it says.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.817
That's not a common name up here.

36:33.901 --> 36:37.487
I'm not from up here.
I can tell.

36:38.572 --> 36:44.286
You're tougher
than the local girls.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.292
I've lived here all my life.
Nice.

36:52.502 --> 36:56.506
This place opened
just a couple of years ago.

36:57.174 --> 37:01.720
It's been here for a couple of
decades. It wasn't always a bar.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.225
It used to be a whorehouse.

37:23.325 --> 37:28.372
If that's all...
You know Lasse Kuntonen, right?

37:31.208 --> 37:36.964
I know who he is.
He's a Finnish police officer.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.134
And his son Erkki Syväjärvi?

37:43.762 --> 37:46.390
I don't know him that well either.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.895
But he's your boyfriend, right?

37:53.981 --> 37:56.650
Why are you lying to me?

38:04.700 --> 38:07.202
Thanks for the coffee.

38:12.249 --> 38:15.711
Tell your boyfriend
to talk to his dad

38:15.794 --> 38:20.882
and ask him who I am.
Things might not be that simple.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.560
Mom, I'm thirsty.

38:37.357 --> 38:41.653
The boy would break in half
from this distance.

39:56.103 --> 39:59.272
(In Swedish:) Why are you here?
I was paid.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.568
Who paid you?
People.

40:06.113 --> 40:10.492
Wouldn't you like to go hunting?
One last time.

40:13.829 --> 40:16.206
Never again.

40:16.289 --> 40:20.710
Why not?
There's nothing in it for me.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.428
Not like there used to be?

40:29.511 --> 40:32.973
I should've quit earlier.
Been somewhere else.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.016
Where?

40:35.851 --> 40:39.813
I could have had a family.
You too.

40:42.149 --> 40:46.111
We would've been lousy family men.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.949
Who knows? We never tried.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.578
And now it's too late.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.629
I'm going to find Jaakko.

41:04.713 --> 41:08.842
And you're going to help me.
You know the area.

41:10.343 --> 41:14.431
You know where I can find him.

41:16.224 --> 41:20.479
I hear you're after Jaakko.
I want to be part of this.

41:23.940 --> 41:28.195
Who's this?
My son.

41:29.196 --> 41:31.865
He has a big mouth.

41:34.159 --> 41:38.997
Erkki. Do you remember me?

41:42.125 --> 41:47.756
Your father never talked much
about his family life,

41:48.298 --> 41:50.759
but I met you once.

41:50.842 --> 41:56.139
I think you were
one or two years old.

41:59.768 --> 42:05.357
He was just here.
He couldn't have gone far.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.276
Shall we go?

42:25.877 --> 42:30.215
Why don't you stay
on the Swedish side.

42:30.298 --> 42:33.343
The boys and I will
go back to Finland.

42:50.277 --> 42:52.946
Inkeri, it's me, Lasse. Listen.

42:53.029 --> 42:56.741
The Swedes are looking
for Jaakko on the Swedish side.

42:56.825 --> 42:59.077
Sooner or later they'll find you,

42:59.160 --> 43:02.831
and if Jaakko is with you,
they'll shoot both of you.

43:30.483 --> 43:34.696
I checked the house yesterday.
They might still be inside.

43:34.779 --> 43:39.326
They're not dumb.
They're not very wise either.

44:07.437 --> 44:11.483
Don't waste your energy.
It's going to be a long night.

44:23.828 --> 44:26.081
What should we do?

44:38.343 --> 44:40.929
They could be at Lake Raittijärvi.

44:46.976 --> 44:49.396
They wouldn't go there.

44:50.522 --> 44:55.235
Why not? Jaakko is friends
with the reindeer herders.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.321
That's why.
It would be too obvious.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.992
Let's go there anyway.

45:06.788 --> 45:11.835
What should I tell your girlfriend?
Tell her everything's all right.

45:21.094 --> 45:25.557
Let's wait till morning at least.
What if they leave?

45:25.765 --> 45:30.145
You really think you're going to
find your way in the dark? Sure.

45:30.645 --> 45:33.732
You want to spend the night
in the cold forest?

45:33.857 --> 45:35.942
You can stay here if you want.

46:22.906 --> 46:24.908
Good evening.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.203
Evening.

46:29.204 --> 46:31.331
Cut the engine.

46:36.002 --> 46:39.631
Who's he?
He's with me.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.008
Was there anything else?

46:44.886 --> 46:47.096
Get out of here.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.933
Why?

46:51.142 --> 46:54.395
Because a police officer
is telling you to.

47:02.987 --> 47:08.284
If you have a gun in your hand,
you'll have to use it.

47:18.586 --> 47:21.297
Just leave it.

47:21.506 --> 47:24.092
Lasse has suffered enough.

47:24.175 --> 47:29.848
Lasse. He always came
with me of his own free will.

47:29.931 --> 47:32.892
Had he wanted to stay home,
he would've.

47:35.228 --> 47:38.231
You're bitter because Lasse quit.

47:38.314 --> 47:41.818
You want to take him down
with you, don't you?

47:42.277 --> 47:45.405
We started doing this together,

47:45.488 --> 47:48.658
so we'll quit together.

48:41.461 --> 48:44.714
Not a glimpse of
Jaakko or his friends.

48:45.590 --> 48:49.761
They're not here now and won't
be later. How do you know?

48:51.220 --> 48:54.432
Someone had seen Jaakko.
Where?

48:54.933 --> 49:00.647
He's gone to Norway.
No one will catch them there.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.609
Let's go check anyway.

49:04.692 --> 49:07.612
Why?
Because I say so.

49:12.909 --> 49:15.620
How were you
thinking of proceeding?

49:17.080 --> 49:19.165
I'm sure you know.

49:25.380 --> 49:28.091
Take them. I have two pairs.

49:29.342 --> 49:31.344
I don't need them.

49:31.427 --> 49:35.348
I'm not going over there
to fight if you're frozen stiff.

49:36.265 --> 49:38.601
Are you scared?

49:41.688 --> 49:44.482
You have nothing to prove.

49:47.527 --> 49:51.906
To whom?
I know you're angry, but still.

49:52.073 --> 49:58.663
Why would I be angry? Well,
there's been all kinds of things.

49:58.788 --> 50:01.124
Are we talking about you?

50:01.207 --> 50:04.794
Are you saying I'm angry at you?
I didn't mean that.

50:05.336 --> 50:09.007
You've got some nerve trying
to ease your conscience.

50:09.799 --> 50:12.510
I don't need to ease anything.

50:15.096 --> 50:17.181
We forgot about you in a week.

50:17.265 --> 50:21.394
And Mom found a better man
to replace you. That's good.

50:21.477 --> 50:24.647
We didn't miss you.
We did fine without you.

50:25.481 --> 50:28.401
Sure you could've given
some explanation.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.821
How do you explain
to a sevenyearold

50:31.904 --> 50:35.241
that you don't know how
to be a father? I was five!

50:35.658 --> 50:37.660
What are you staring at?

50:37.744 --> 50:40.455
The whole village
will hear you yelling.

50:40.580 --> 50:43.499
This is the end of
this damn conversation.

50:43.624 --> 50:46.294
One more thing.
What is it, dammit?

50:46.377 --> 50:49.422
You have to know
the consequences.

50:49.505 --> 50:51.591
They'll put you in prison.

50:51.674 --> 50:55.970
Or you'll get killed. Jaakko
doesn't care about things like that.

50:56.054 --> 50:58.473
He has nothing to lose.

50:59.182 --> 51:03.478
You have a family. Elmeri will
grow up without a father.

51:04.979 --> 51:08.232
It runs in the family, doesn't it?

51:16.282 --> 51:20.119
I'm not going over there.
Do what you like.

51:49.524 --> 51:51.901
Maybe it's better this way.

51:55.655 --> 51:57.406
Yeah.

52:10.002 --> 52:15.550
What does the giraffe say?
It's not a giraffe.

52:15.675 --> 52:17.969
It's not a giraffe?
No.

52:18.177 --> 52:20.680
It does have a long neck.

52:20.847 --> 52:24.600
Here.
That's not its neck.

52:24.725 --> 52:29.605
This is.
What does it say?

52:33.109 --> 52:36.404
I'm frozen in shock.

52:53.212 --> 52:55.840
Come dance with me.

52:56.465 --> 53:00.052
Son, I just came home
from a hunting trip. I'm tired.

53:00.178 --> 53:02.972
I can come.
No way.

53:03.055 --> 53:05.099
I will.

53:06.142 --> 53:09.687
Mom and Dad will join us later.

54:35.773 --> 54:39.485
I've saved some money
over the years.

54:40.861 --> 54:44.949
You need a house.
You have a family.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.827
You're living
at your mom's place,

54:47.910 --> 54:51.789
and your woman and child here
in the bar. You don't have to.

54:54.875 --> 54:58.713
I don't need the money
for anything. Still.

55:03.301 --> 55:07.847
Sure, I can give it to the poor,
but I'd rather give it to you.

55:11.475 --> 55:14.270
Okay, if you insist.

55:17.898 --> 55:20.526
I don't want to see my grandson

55:20.609 --> 55:24.655
living surrounded by drunks
and cigarette smoke.

55:24.739 --> 55:26.866
Right.

55:31.120 --> 55:33.122
I could try to find you a job.

55:33.205 --> 55:37.626
I know a couple of people...
Let's take it one clay at a time.

55:38.252 --> 55:40.129
Sure.

55:51.057 --> 55:53.851
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

55:53.934 --> 55:56.979
What is it?
Jaakko.

55:57.146 --> 55:59.398
Don't say anything.

56:00.524 --> 56:03.861
Let's talk outside.
It's best we talk inside.

56:04.362 --> 56:08.199
What about Jaakko?
You know we like to ski.

56:08.282 --> 56:13.079
Get to the point. We were supposed
to ski to the Jussintupa Hut

56:13.162 --> 56:16.082
and grill sausages,
but we changed our mind.

56:16.207 --> 56:20.127
There were people who we
didn't feel like hanging out with.

56:20.252 --> 56:23.798
Jaakko was there,
and probably also his two friends.

56:23.964 --> 56:29.637
Don't tell anyone we told you.

56:29.762 --> 56:32.848
We won't.
You're a good boy.

56:32.932 --> 56:36.936
Ruthless. That's what
you have to be up here.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.939
You're like your father,
and that's good.

56:52.034 --> 56:54.745
Think about it some more.

56:55.287 --> 56:58.666
You lied to me!
You told me they're in Norway.

56:58.749 --> 57:03.712
If you go, you'll go alone.
Hell yeah, I will.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.049
(In Swedish:) Go with him.

58:02.730 --> 58:04.899
They're all inside.

58:06.025 --> 58:08.611
Let's go from different directions.

58:53.322 --> 58:55.157
Jaakko.

58:59.245 --> 59:02.540
You're being ambushed
from the forest.

59:07.503 --> 59:10.339
Get the hell out of here.

59:11.799 --> 59:14.134
Immediately.

59:18.931 --> 59:23.060
Stay there.
Go.

59:27.398 --> 59:29.525
Come.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.227
Come on out.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:29.335
You fucking shot at me!
Calm down.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:32.796
You got one in your cheek.
Put snow on it.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:09.041
I told you we'd get this back.

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:19.635
TO TUOMO

01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:40.322
We have to make it
to the village before them.

01:01:40.406 --> 01:01:42.700
Let's sort one thing out first.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.120
I saw what you did.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.998
Why did you let Jaakko go?

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:55.003
Jaakko is my son.

01:01:57.423 --> 01:01:59.842
Your brother.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.595
I doubt you want to kill
your brother.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.015
Hey Lasse.

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:32.559
Wake him up.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:37.564
Wake up.
Goddammit.

01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:41.443
What is it?

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.615
Where's the ammo for this gun?

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:55.582
What are you going to do with it?
You told Lasse where to find us.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.001
No.

01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:01.588
You were hiding in the bushes,
weren't you?

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:06.802
He means we understand your pain.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.473
Your stepdad was violent
when he drank,

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.393
like all your mother's boyfriends.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:20.107
My husband should've intervened.
Right, honey?

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.902
You should've
helped this boy,

01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:29.658
and not just look away.
Stop that.

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:35.539
What's wrong with you?
With who?

01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:38.458
With people, in general.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:44.006
I just want ammo for these guns.

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:59.229
It's in the kitchen,
above the window.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:35.849
When they come, go make sure
your sister and Elmeri are safe.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:39.603
I'll take care of Jaakko.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.992
We're not leaving. Nobody is.

01:05:57.329 --> 01:06:00.332
Go back into hiding and stay there.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.542
This isn't you.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:08.465
This is exactly me.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.823
You don't know what you're doing.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:18.326
You bet your ass I do.
I'd like to shoot you.

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:20.787
I didn't mean that.

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:26.043
I didn't shoot Tuomo.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:30.297
Somebody did.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:37.888
I wanted to talk to you.
You wouldn't listen. I lost it.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.891
It happens every now and then.

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:45.353
Tuomo started
pointing his gun at us.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.275
Where's Lasse?

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:53.028
I don't give a shit.

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:57.199
I beat him up and left him in
the woods. Why did you do that?

01:07:58.325 --> 01:08:00.577
I lost it.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.789
You know what it's like
when we lose it.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:09.086
Our account is settled.
Let's go.

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:11.880
You're not going anywhere.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.717
Your friend can go,
but you're not going anywhere.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:19.179
Tuomo was a good man.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:24.850
He raised me.
Come finish it then.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.082
What do you think you're doing?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:35.546
What? Get the fuck out of here.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:04.910
We have your son. You want
to come with us? Which one?

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:08.705
Huh?
I'll follow you.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.071
HEALTHCARE CENTER

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.807
(In Swedish:)
What brings you to me?

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:17.732
I was thinking of leaving
without telling anyone,

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:22.779
but then I decided
I wanted to say goodbye.

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.533
There's nothing more I can do.

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:33.832
The police talked to Erkki's mother.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.335
Jaakko didn't shoot Tuomo.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:45.760
Then who did?
The one with the red beard.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:50.473
Is that true? That's what
Erkki's mom said to the police.

01:11:58.315 --> 01:12:00.567
One more thing.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:07.741
The shooter was found dead
in front of a wilderness hut.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:11.911
Killed with a shotgun.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.626
Do you happen to know
anything about it?

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.088
No?

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:26.176
That's what I thought.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:38.438
Soon the Swedish and Finnish police
are going to raid this village.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.941
This fighting
has been going on too long.

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:53.828
So if you have
any unfinished business,

01:12:53.912 --> 01:12:56.581
you should take care of it
while you can.

01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:10.261
I'll wait for you.

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:49.717
You don't get it.

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:53.012
Erkki never wanted this.

01:13:57.308 --> 01:14:00.353
He only wanted your respect.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:03.189
He wanted you to appreciate him.

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:09.446
He wanted you to realize
that you have a son.

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:36.514
You're not like me.

01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:40.059
Neither should you be.

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:53.281
I'll be better than you.

01:14:56.576 --> 01:15:00.079
Get going.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:01.099
Are they waiting
by the side of the road?

01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:12.860
I had to tell him
you're Jaakko's father.

01:16:12.944 --> 01:16:15.697
Tell who?
Gunnar.

01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:21.953
That's okay.

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.052
Hi, it's Mom.

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:41.556
I have someone here
who wants to talk to you.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:48.187
Jaakko.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:50.690
It's me, Lasse.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:55.028
Can we meet?

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.157
Without guns.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.327
Just you and me.
<i>Why?</i>

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:07.832
I'd like to explain why everything
happened the way it did.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:12.128
<i>You had thirty years to tell me.
Why now?</i>

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.214
I know you didn't kill Tuomo.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:18.593
You can still get out of this.

01:17:20.595 --> 01:17:22.847
<i>Where do you want to meet?</i>

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:27.185
The big bridge at the edge
of the village. I'll see you there.

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:32.231
<i>Right away.</i>
Yes. <i>I'll be</i> there.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:35.068
<i>If you bring people...</i>

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:40.990
Who would I bring? I'll come alone.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.204
<i>(In</i> Swedish:) <i>He disappeared.</i>

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:31.165
He knows we're coming after him.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:47.515
<i>There's a tunnel ahead.</i>

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:52.311
It'll happen soon. Watch your back.
<i>Okay.</i>

01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:23.820
<i>(In Swedish:) Lasse, listen.</i>

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:32.954
Gunnar.

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:37.917
Fuck.
How many sons do you have?

01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:43.548
Only those two, as far as I know.

01:20:43.631 --> 01:20:46.926
Now I understand
what's going on here.

01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:57.019
I was thinking of
going to see my son.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.357
Go ahead.

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:07.113
<i>I'll go alone.</i>

01:21:13.703 --> 01:21:17.373
I've never let a catch get away.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:20.334
<i>And I'm not about to start.</i>

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.051
<i>Okay.</i>

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.432
Stay there.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.643
You might make it.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:59.707
I'll shoot!
I'm not here for you!

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:05.249
Jaakko.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.633
Jaakko, I'm here!

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.287
Get up.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:10.189
Why did you come?

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.155
Why did you come?

01:25:28.374 --> 01:25:30.668
If I knew

01:25:35.923 --> 01:25:39.009
why I left you back then,

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:41.595
I'd tell you.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:52.231
That's what you came to tell me?

01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.071
YES.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:06.704
That's good enough for me.
