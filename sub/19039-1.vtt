<i> "Home"?</i>
- Excuse me?

01:12.132 --> 01:14.336
<i> I'm calling from a phone that I found</i>

01:14.466 --> 01:17.879
<i> I know the owner does not,
so I looked</i> at the contacts

01:18.007 --> 01:20.045
<i> and found one called "Home".</i>

01:20.174 --> 01:22.248
You have my phone?
<i> - There seems to</i>.

01:22.382 --> 01:26.625
Thank you! Where he was?
<i> - Op 't patio of the Garibaldi</i>

01:26.757 --> 01:29.838
Okay! unbelievable
I do not know how I'm could forget.

01:29.966 --> 01:33.166
<i> Just ...
You discussed violently with someone.</i>

01:33.299 --> 01:35.337
<i> You stopped abruptly,
paid the bill</i>

01:35.466 --> 01:37.587
<i> and ran off without your phone.</i>

01:37.716 --> 01:40.833
Sitting next to me?
<i> - A few tables away from you</i>.

01:41.299 --> 01:44.878
And yet, did you hear anything?
<i> - I think everyone 's heard</i>.

01:45.049 --> 01:48.000
I am ashamed broken.
I must have freaked received.

01:48.132 --> 01:51.877
As you have noticed
I have relationship with someone ...

01:52.007 --> 01:54.128
<i> Bruno?</i>
- Sorry?

01:54.257 --> 01:58.464
<i> Do you have problems with Bruno?
He called seven times since you left.</i>

01:58.591 --> 01:59.705
<i> He texted too.</i>

01:59.841 --> 02:03.254
<i> Shall I read the messages?</i>
- No, it's okay.

02:05.882 --> 02:07.790
But I do not understand ...

02:08.007 --> 02:12.795
If you saw me leave without a phone,
why you gave him not to me?

02:13.382 --> 02:16.297
<i> I had to do, indeed.
But what happened?</i>

02:16.632 --> 02:21.254
<i> You took your phone
and had left without looking at me.</i>

02:21.382 --> 02:24.415
<i> While now,
When I return to him ...</i>

02:24.549 --> 02:26.090
<i> I will get your attention.</i>

02:26.216 --> 02:27.792
Damn! Blockhead!
<i> - Pardon</i> ?

02:27.966 --> 02:31.083
My bathtub is overflowing.
<i> - Go ahead, I'll call you back</i>.

02:33.382 --> 02:34.543
Damn!

02:35.799 --> 02:38.288
It's everywhere!

02:46.216 --> 02:49.048
You do not give me much time.
<i> - Who did you do</i> ?

02:49.174 --> 02:51.414
No, Bruno, that's enough.

02:51.549 --> 02:54.084
Quarreling enough for one day.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.416
<i> Diane, it's a mess.
There is no agreement.</i>

02:57.549 --> 02:59.919
I said my opinion!
I want something else.

03:00.049 --> 03:04.292
I want to go to sleep or bathe.
<i> - It's the right</i>.

03:04.424 --> 03:08.204
I do not give in. Too bad you are not me
understand. We split up. Point.

03:08.341 --> 03:09.882
<i> We've been apart, sweetheart.</i>

03:10.007 --> 03:13.704
I mean professionally.
Do not call me "sweetheart" It's ridiculous.

03:13.841 --> 03:16.625
<i> Why do not you trust me?
One more time.</i>

03:16.757 --> 03:18.547
I gotta go, I got a call.

03:18.674 --> 03:21.044
<i> Who?</i>
- That does not concern you.

03:21.174 --> 03:23.129
<i> Think about it, we need this ...</i>

03:23.257 --> 03:25.295
Bruno, I hang up! Day.

03:34.007 --> 03:36.211
You work on my nerves.
<i> - Now all</i>

03:36.341 --> 03:38.912
<i> We know each other only.</i>
- I'm sorry.

03:39.049 --> 03:43.173
I did not think that was you.
I spoke with...

03:43.341 --> 03:44.585
<i> Bruno?</i>

03:45.841 --> 03:48.246
Yes. He's my ex.

03:48.632 --> 03:49.911
<i> Is it long ago?</i>

03:50.257 --> 03:52.828
What?
<i> - That you are separated</i>.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.166
Three years.
But I do not think he knows it.

03:57.132 --> 03:59.799
Why do I say this?
I know you disagree.

03:59.924 --> 04:01.121
<i> I can not.</i>

04:01.299 --> 04:04.712
<i> Do you have a name
if I continue to call "home"?</i>

04:05.257 --> 04:06.584
"Home" Me pleases.

04:07.966 --> 04:10.289
Diane. And you?

04:10.424 --> 04:11.621
<i> Alexandre.</i>

04:12.424 --> 04:14.877
<i> Why Bruno keeps you chasing?</i>

04:15.174 --> 04:18.005
He's not after me.
We're partners.

04:19.173 --> 04:22.089
<i> Do you have one now?</i>
- A law firm.

04:22.157 --> 04:24.531
<i> Civil or company?</i>
- Both one bit.

04:24.566 --> 04:27.730
<i> What do you prefer?</i>
- Depends...

04:28.674 --> 04:31.956
What do you do exactly?
<i> - Nothing. I'm talking to you.</i>

04:32.507 --> 04:35.042
<i> Best cute, right?</i>
- Yeah ...

04:35.966 --> 04:39.830
But a little ...
- <i> 's Bit odd. Indeed.</i>

04:40.007 --> 04:44.629
<i> I suggest that we not let this.
Especially since we now have one opportunity ...</i>

04:44.757 --> 04:47.708
An opportunity?
<i> - To eat together</i>

04:47.841 --> 04:52.582
Okay. And who is the opportunity?
<i> - For me, I admit it</i>.

04:52.799 --> 04:55.122
What hangs on to it for me?
<i> - A telephone</i>

04:55.299 --> 04:58.665
But it's my phone!
<i> - But I'm</i>.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.750
You hold him hostage.

05:00.882 --> 05:04.082
I do not know what to say ...

05:05.382 --> 05:07.254
I have a principle.

05:07.382 --> 05:10.997
Never go out to eat with strangers.
<i> - You are right</i>.

05:11.174 --> 05:12.750
<i> Especially at this time.</i>

05:13.132 --> 05:14.541
<i> A lunch?</i>

05:15.466 --> 05:18.879
<i> A cup of coffee? An icecream?
'N Pancake?</i>

05:19.216 --> 05:22.297
<i> 'n Ride on the carousel?
Help me!</i>

05:22.757 --> 05:23.954
You never give up.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.172
<i> Never. persevere
is one of my top qualities.</i>

05:27.341 --> 05:29.711
And modesty?
<i> - who also</i>.

05:29.882 --> 05:32.797
<i> But I'm not sure I therefore
tonight a "yes" get it.</i>

05:32.924 --> 05:34.168
<i> Am I right?</i>

05:35.924 --> 05:38.210
<i> And, "Home", what we do?</i>

05:38.757 --> 05:40.664
<i> Tomorrow, 14 o'clock?</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:45.090
Tomorrow I'm engaged to 15 hours.
<i> - Okay, 15.30</i>.

05:45.549 --> 05:48.084
<i> Do you know Cafe Monte Cristo?</i>
- Yes.

05:48.216 --> 05:50.290
<i> Perfect.
15.30 in the Monte Cristo.</i>

05:51.257 --> 05:55.713
How will we recognize each other?
<i> - To begin, I know you all</i>.

05:55.841 --> 05:57.250
Yes. Stupid of me.

05:57.382 --> 06:00.582
<i> And you'll see,
You can not miss me ...</i>

06:02.299 --> 06:05.131
Okay. Until tomorrow then.
<i> - Okay</i>

06:05.299 --> 06:07.089
<i> Goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

08:25.924 --> 08:27.121
"Home"?

08:28.799 --> 08:30.754
Sorry, there was a lot of traffic.

08:35.674 --> 08:38.672
Are you?
- Yes, very good.

08:46.757 --> 08:49.708
It's always one little weird,
a first meeting.

08:49.841 --> 08:52.411
You talk on the phone,
imagine everything in,

08:52.632 --> 08:53.794
and it's not true.

08:53.924 --> 08:57.621
I had imagined nothing special.

08:58.007 --> 09:00.128
What would you like?
- A Perrier.

09:00.257 --> 09:03.208
No ice with one slice of lemon.
- Indeed.

09:04.091 --> 09:05.963
Before anything else?
- No, thank you.

09:07.341 --> 09:08.620
Do you come here often?

09:08.757 --> 09:11.755
No, but people do not forget me soon.

09:12.757 --> 09:14.463
You have a beautiful smile.

09:15.841 --> 09:17.417
Sorry, it did not.

09:19.424 --> 09:21.794
Before I forget, it 's important ...

09:22.216 --> 09:24.123
You must charge the battery.

09:29.674 --> 09:31.332
Okay ...

09:31.549 --> 09:32.597
What's wrong?

09:33.632 --> 09:34.911
Nothing.

09:36.049 --> 09:37.921
I'm 40 cm too short?

09:38.466 --> 09:40.835
Is that bad?
- Not at all.

09:40.966 --> 09:43.336
It's even ...
Does not matter.

09:45.341 --> 09:46.389
It's different.

09:46.424 --> 09:49.837
It's strange, perhaps surprisingly,
but not very.

09:50.716 --> 09:51.829
A war is bad.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.999
Bad breath is bad.
But not this.

09:55.716 --> 09:59.544
I admit I was surprised.
- I understand that.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.459
It surprises me sometimes.

10:02.882 --> 10:06.579
You were such a little man not expected.
That was a shock to you.

10:06.716 --> 10:09.548
And now you have 't handle.
That is normal.

10:10.216 --> 10:12.751
Yes, people look at us.
What did you want?

10:12.882 --> 10:16.923
They wonder what we're doing here,
'N handsome blonde and one dwarf.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.163
But it's simple.

10:19.174 --> 10:23.298
'N Determined woman poeiert
her ex-husband off to harass her.

10:23.424 --> 10:26.126
She was upset and forgot her phone.

10:26.257 --> 10:28.047
A man of 1.36 meters ...

10:28.174 --> 10:31.042
I know, I'm larger,
but I am 1.36 meters ...

10:31.799 --> 10:33.955
saw it all
and brought back her phone.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.624
What is so extraordinary about that?

10:37.007 --> 10:40.373
Nothing.
Nothing to twist your neck for, right?

10:40.507 --> 10:42.332
You're right.
- Okay.

10:46.716 --> 10:48.208
What do you do next?

10:48.341 --> 10:51.339
Hereafter?
- After we're done here.

10:51.466 --> 10:54.381
I have an appointment with one client.

10:54.507 --> 10:57.955
You know what? You call him
and cancel the appointment.

10:58.132 --> 11:01.498
Yes. He will be surprised,
maybe a little annoyed,

11:01.632 --> 11:04.121
but you will get a new appointment.

11:04.257 --> 11:07.421
And I will take you
for one unforgettable experience.

11:07.924 --> 11:09.998
I mean it.
It'll change your life.

11:10.132 --> 11:12.123
I can not do.
- Anyway.

11:12.257 --> 11:16.038
It has changed my life!
- What are you talking about?

11:16.174 --> 11:18.793
Adrenaline.
- Alexandre!

11:18.924 --> 11:21.957
Vanessa!
- I thought you were in New York.

11:22.132 --> 11:26.754
Olivier is still at the Biennale.
- He's got time for that. I work.

11:26.924 --> 11:28.019
Day.

11:28.091 --> 11:30.544
I apologize. Diane, a girlfriend.
Vanessa, a girlfriend.

11:30.674 --> 11:32.083
Pleasant.

11:32.424 --> 11:35.091
Are you coming to the birthday of Maurice?
- I do not know.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.000
I hope so. You look good.
- Greetings to Olivier.

11:38.132 --> 11:41.379
I do, he'll be back tonight.
- Bye.

11:43.591 --> 11:45.914
Where were we?

11:46.049 --> 11:50.588
The adrenaline rich experience
you are going to experience in just ...

11:51.424 --> 11:52.668
an hour.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.710
Sebastien, with Alexandre.

11:57.882 --> 12:00.584
Can I have a plane within an hour?

12:01.924 --> 12:03.203
Two persons.

12:04.174 --> 12:05.832
Okay, see you later. Thanks.

12:07.341 --> 12:08.454
It is arranged.

12:32.007 --> 12:34.709
My God!

12:34.882 --> 12:36.126
10,000 feet!

12:36.882 --> 12:39.667
10,000 feet! That is almost three kilometers!

12:40.049 --> 12:42.170
Indeed. How are you?

12:42.299 --> 12:44.171
Not good.
- That is normal.

12:44.591 --> 12:46.581
I want to go home.

12:46.716 --> 12:49.418
Let's do that.
But we go in that direction.

12:49.757 --> 12:51.748
No I do not want that.

12:52.257 --> 12:56.002
Do not worry. I have experience.
- Really?

12:56.341 --> 12:59.541
It's my second time.
- What?

13:00.216 --> 13:01.922
That's not funny!

13:02.757 --> 13:04.629
Stop the plane!
- Okay.

13:09.799 --> 13:11.256
Come on, "Home"!

13:13.132 --> 13:14.839
No, I can not!
- Diane!

13:15.424 --> 13:17.379
It seems to good.

13:18.049 --> 13:21.082
I can not, I can not ...
- Diane, listen.

13:21.257 --> 13:25.085
You're with me. Everything is OK.
It'll be okay.

13:25.216 --> 13:26.874
"5" we jump.

13:28.799 --> 13:29.898
A...

13:30.132 --> 13:31.197
Two...

13:31.424 --> 13:32.585
Three...

14:14.299 --> 14:15.792
That was...

14:16.007 --> 14:17.879
Something I never felt before.

14:18.007 --> 14:20.839
Look, I got goose bumps!
- I believe you.

14:21.341 --> 14:24.789
My God, I've jumped out of an airplane.

14:25.007 --> 14:27.330
I jumped out of a plane in flight!

14:27.632 --> 14:29.789
Thank you.

14:30.716 --> 14:34.496
I have no words for.
- If you find them, call me.

14:35.591 --> 14:39.419
I do not have your number.
- He's in your phone. "Alexandre."

14:40.424 --> 14:43.126
You leave nothing 's chance, huh?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.752
That may not like you
doing parachute jumping.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.208
Hello, sir.
- Day, Monique.

15:52.382 --> 15:53.626
No...

15:55.507 --> 15:56.669
No...

15:57.257 --> 15:58.287
Obedient, Luchio, no.

15:59.049 --> 16:00.921
No, Luchio, no!

16:01.966 --> 16:03.079
Benji!

16:03.216 --> 16:04.311
Call your dog!

16:05.216 --> 16:06.756
Off, boy!

16:07.882 --> 16:10.880
I'm crazy about that dog!
- He loves you.

16:11.007 --> 16:12.334
That's the problem.

16:12.924 --> 16:15.756
You should talk to her, Daddy.
- Why?

16:17.632 --> 16:20.832
She has a hard time.
A little understanding please.

16:20.966 --> 16:23.964
You mean we have to endure heavy.
It's dirty here.

16:24.091 --> 16:26.544
Everywhere is dust.
She vacuums never.

16:26.674 --> 16:28.795
She lost her husband. She's depressed.

16:28.924 --> 16:30.121
That was five years ago.

16:30.549 --> 16:32.207
She loved him very much.

16:32.757 --> 16:34.333
What do I do with this?

16:35.507 --> 16:37.996
Who would you give me. The color pleases me.

16:41.757 --> 16:42.871
Damn!

16:43.007 --> 16:46.455
I do not think so.
The real estate industry is one steamship.

16:46.591 --> 16:50.880
He is very slow in the turns
and keeps the same heading.

16:53.382 --> 16:55.622
I'm sorry. Yes?

16:56.132 --> 16:59.463
I said no.
Moreover, the salary was too low.

16:59.924 --> 17:02.459
What they proposed?
- Not enough.

17:02.632 --> 17:04.290
And that is?
- Not enough!

17:04.424 --> 17:06.249
That is more than zero?

17:06.757 --> 17:09.376
Because you deserve now.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.580
I'd have to say yes?
- No.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.873
That makes no sense.

17:15.465 --> 17:18.333
The question is:
"What do I do?"

17:18.465 --> 17:21.250
I will not mention.
I want to launch my app.

17:21.757 --> 17:23.997
The idea is good. It can happen.

17:24.215 --> 17:25.839
But I do investors need.

17:25.965 --> 17:29.461
In France, everything is small, you should
'S great to see. That's what you taught me.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.080
Monique
The radio can be slightly softer?

17:34.049 --> 17:36.253
What I needed sponsors.

17:36.424 --> 17:38.545
Men who are willing to invest

17:38.674 --> 17:41.838
in talented guys like me
who have ideas.

17:41.966 --> 17:43.672
People like Timo Atanen.

17:43.966 --> 17:46.750
Who?
- The Finn "Sparkle" booted.

17:47.174 --> 17:48.371
Right, yes.

17:48.674 --> 17:52.004
Go talk to him.
- Such men are unreachable.

17:52.132 --> 17:53.459
You do not know.

17:53.674 --> 17:56.209
I'm stupid, I should have taken the job.

17:58.591 --> 18:00.665
I'm going out tonight.
Do you 50 euros?

18:06.674 --> 18:08.997
Make it 100, I can treat.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.335
Thank you.

18:13.757 --> 18:15.333
That's 150.

18:15.882 --> 18:17.044
Right, yes.

18:17.174 --> 18:19.414
I give you this back.
- Yes.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.256
Thank you.

18:35.841 --> 18:39.835
My eye vibrates strange.
- Palpebral tremors.

18:40.799 --> 18:42.706
So hot.

18:42.841 --> 18:47.083
What are the causes?
- Fatigue, stress, emotional shock.

18:48.466 --> 18:50.789
Did you recently one emotional shock?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.708
Excuse me?

18:54.049 --> 18:56.253
It's a virus.
- No.

18:56.799 --> 18:57.913
I love you.

18:59.299 --> 19:01.420
That is, the name of the virus.

19:02.049 --> 19:04.170
Sorry. I understand him.

19:06.049 --> 19:09.166
I thought you said ...

19:12.341 --> 19:15.789
How we got 's inside?
- An infected mail.

19:18.507 --> 19:21.505
Why you looking at me?
I did not do it.

19:21.632 --> 19:25.293
We are three of us. I do not open "I'm
love you "and Bruno mails either.

19:25.424 --> 19:28.208
Still, I was' t necessarily ...

19:28.341 --> 19:30.047
Can you save us from?

19:30.924 --> 19:32.630
There may be effects.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.215
Do your best.

19:37.341 --> 19:39.627
I was' t!
- Who then?

19:39.757 --> 19:42.672
I'm not the only one here
which is angling for love!

19:45.841 --> 19:47.583
<i> 10:00, Tuesday.</i>
- What?

19:47.716 --> 19:52.172
<i> Lefort's hearing with the judge.</i>
- We would go for one scheme.

19:52.299 --> 19:55.131
<i> That's what you wanted.
Our client chooses one lawsuit.</i>

19:55.632 --> 19:58.796
He's a jerk.
<i> - He defends its interests</i>.

19:58.924 --> 20:01.875
He does not.
He will pay his wife.

20:02.007 --> 20:05.088
<i> He's got money.
We need funds, sweetheart.</i>

20:05.216 --> 20:07.372
Do not call me "baby"!

20:30.424 --> 20:32.331
Okay. How do we do it?

20:33.091 --> 20:35.793
What?
- The rent, the clients, the shares.

20:35.924 --> 20:38.957
You wanted us separated.
- I did not say that.

20:39.091 --> 20:43.167
You said, "If you are 't disagree,
we split up. "

20:43.299 --> 20:46.083
I 't disagree, so we split up.

20:46.299 --> 20:49.297
Coralie, who would you stay?
Diane and me?

20:51.257 --> 20:52.964
That should not ask me.

20:53.257 --> 20:56.670
Do not put her in that position.
- I do not, but you.

20:56.882 --> 21:00.461
Maybe I was overreacting.

21:01.091 --> 21:05.961
We have until Tuesday to decide?
I will think about it.

21:06.091 --> 21:09.255
Coralie, call Lefort
and confirm the hearing.

21:13.674 --> 21:14.953
Magnesium.

21:17.157 --> 21:18.166
Excuse me?

21:18.191 --> 21:20.940
Try magnesium
for palpebral tremors.

21:21.424 --> 21:22.585
Okay.

21:23.091 --> 21:24.714
Did you do anything?

21:26.216 --> 21:28.586
Anyway: the Marconi file.

21:48.757 --> 21:50.878
<i> Alexandre, with Diane.</i>
- Diane!

21:51.091 --> 21:52.096
Damn.

21:52.099 --> 21:54.766
<i> You all right?</i>
- I banged my head against 's ceiling.

21:54.882 --> 21:57.003
Wait. I go out.

21:57.549 --> 21:58.627
Sorry.

22:00.299 --> 22:01.543
That's better.

22:01.924 --> 22:03.831
<i> Where are you?</i>
- In Liege.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.838
In the opera of Liège.
<i> - The Liege opera</i>

22:08.091 --> 22:11.955
We are working on an extension.
<i> - Not bad</i>.

22:12.091 --> 22:16.381
It's a big yard. It is sublime.
How are you?

22:16.966 --> 22:18.624
All right, thank you.

22:19.132 --> 22:21.751
We would still call ...

22:21.882 --> 22:24.168
but maybe it's a bad time?

22:24.382 --> 22:28.541
<i> No. I wanted to call you,
but I had no time.</i>

22:28.757 --> 22:32.585
I understand that.
For me it is an intensive period.

22:32.716 --> 22:34.671
I have to do a lot.

22:35.091 --> 22:36.881
<i> I will not keep you any longer.</i>

22:37.007 --> 22:39.164
Moment.
What are you doing tonight?

22:41.007 --> 22:42.204
<i> I do not know.</i>

22:42.341 --> 22:45.956
My flight was at 17.00.
We can meet at 21:00?

22:46.507 --> 22:50.548
I would like to find a place.
Rather ... unusual.

22:50.674 --> 22:54.668
On the ground floor?
<i> - On the ground floor</i>

22:55.091 --> 22:56.252
Okay then.

22:56.382 --> 22:59.748
Until tonight, Alexandre.
Have a nice flight.

22:59.882 --> 23:02.038
<i> Thank you. Much love.</i>
- You too.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.413
What?
- Nothing. The Marconi file.

23:08.591 --> 23:10.167
Okay.

23:10.799 --> 23:13.204
For Lefort ... hearing procrastinate.

23:13.341 --> 23:15.047
But...
- No buts.

23:15.382 --> 23:18.499
As long as Bruno and I 't disagree,
we do not go.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.381
Alexandre?
- Here.

24:06.882 --> 24:08.209
Alexandre?

24:09.049 --> 24:10.376
Here.

24:10.924 --> 24:13.080
You scared me.
- This way.

24:22.799 --> 24:24.043
Where are we going?

24:39.632 --> 24:40.876
Hey.

24:51.299 --> 24:53.752
Day, Simone.
- Hey handsome.

24:53.966 --> 24:55.506
Do you have a table for two?

24:55.632 --> 24:58.168
She says goodbye no?
- Yes, sorry.

24:58.299 --> 24:59.377
I tease you, baby.

24:59.507 --> 25:02.458
Mario!
You got a table for Alexandre?

25:02.882 --> 25:04.161
For two.

25:04.799 --> 25:07.667
Sit at the bar.
Let's see what we can do.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.120
Thank you.

25:13.174 --> 25:15.923
What a nice place.
- Is not it?

25:16.049 --> 25:17.755
It is 100% clandestinely.

25:17.882 --> 25:21.330
Cooks of cargo
take turns in the kitchen.

25:21.882 --> 25:23.672
Simone, who's cooking tonight?

25:23.799 --> 25:26.085
Andreas. A Cypriot.

25:26.382 --> 25:29.665
He squid in ink sauce.
I do not want leftovers ...

25:29.799 --> 25:32.583
She's great, but do not work against her.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.125
I'm lucky, she likes me.

25:34.257 --> 25:36.544
I have the impression that everyone likes you.

25:36.799 --> 25:37.894
Yes.

25:39.424 --> 25:40.472
What?

25:40.841 --> 25:43.673
"Everyone" is almost the same as "none."

25:44.841 --> 25:46.997
Your table is ready.
- <i> Great. Vamos.</i>

25:47.174 --> 25:49.081
I can...
- No, I'll do it.

25:54.716 --> 25:57.833
I'm glad I'm here.
- It's obvious.

26:01.966 --> 26:03.209
Tell me a joke.

26:03.341 --> 26:05.379
What?
- Tell me one joke.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.623
It will break the ice.

26:07.757 --> 26:10.506
I'm terrible at jokes.
I can not tell.

26:10.632 --> 26:14.211
I remember the punch line
while I tell

26:14.341 --> 26:16.166
and then I remember the story.

26:16.424 --> 26:18.331
And I do not the jokes.

26:18.466 --> 26:20.421
You do not the jokes?
- Never.

26:20.549 --> 26:23.749
I concentrate,
but do not know if I should laugh ...

26:23.882 --> 26:26.122
Do you feel uncomfortable?
- Quite.

26:26.257 --> 26:28.876
And by my concentration I do not understand.

26:29.007 --> 26:32.124
So no jokes, sorry.
- Okay, I'll start.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.878
An Eskimo waiting for his girlfriend on 't pack ice.

26:37.257 --> 26:40.954
He takes his thermometer and says:
"If they are at -20 is not, I'm gone."

26:41.091 --> 26:42.548
I understand him.

26:44.216 --> 26:46.336
That was frustrating.
- Is not it?

26:46.549 --> 26:48.042
Okay, your turn.

26:48.341 --> 26:52.002
A female dromedary
crosses one camel and says:

26:52.132 --> 26:55.249
"Shame that hump."
- I knew him.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.669
pull a face?
- Pull one for me.

26:59.924 --> 27:02.080
Then the ice will really be broken.
- Indeed.

27:02.466 --> 27:03.496
A face...

27:03.632 --> 27:06.002
This is the "plastic surgery face".

27:06.132 --> 27:07.459
Ready?

27:09.507 --> 27:11.960
I did not do anything.
This is 100% natural.

27:12.091 --> 27:13.204
You're lying.

27:18.382 --> 27:21.131
Use your napkin.
Our Cypriot let go.

27:21.716 --> 27:23.836
You see, we have entertained us.

27:44.841 --> 27:48.669
That's someone who does not like me.
- What?

27:48.882 --> 27:51.003
You said everyone liked me.

27:51.382 --> 27:53.456
Karl Willems not.

27:53.966 --> 27:55.044
Who is that?

27:55.174 --> 27:58.089
The architect of that building.
- Aha.

27:58.257 --> 27:59.715
Why not?

28:00.591 --> 28:04.501
Years ago we were competitors
For one project, and I won.

28:04.924 --> 28:07.294
He is very big,
the poor thing felt ...

28:07.424 --> 28:08.703
humiliated.

28:18.507 --> 28:20.083
You are very beautiful.

28:38.799 --> 28:40.396
I do not know what to say ...

28:40.924 --> 28:42.465
Good night, Alexandre?

28:44.841 --> 28:46.748
I have great entertained.

28:47.507 --> 28:48.704
Me too.

29:36.257 --> 29:37.286
Benji!

29:37.591 --> 29:39.877
Do you have adjourned the hearing?
- Yes.

29:40.007 --> 29:42.922
But we were 't agree.
- I did think about it.

29:43.049 --> 29:46.746
If his divorce goes smoothly,
Lefort let us manage its heritage.

29:46.882 --> 29:49.797
The millions he laundered
and stand on offshore accounts?

29:49.924 --> 29:51.381
He can save us.

29:51.507 --> 29:53.249
He can tarnish our reputation.

29:53.382 --> 29:56.333
A bankruptcy law firm
is good for 's image?

29:56.466 --> 29:59.748
Money is not everything.
In the long term it pays ethics.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.505
Come on, you can trust me.

30:01.674 --> 30:05.040
No. Our 5-year marriage taught me
I did not know you

30:05.216 --> 30:08.048
and that the reality
my imagination far exceeded.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.456
Ask me anything you want,
but not to trust you.

30:14.591 --> 30:15.870
Something has changed.

30:18.799 --> 30:20.920
You're not the same anymore.

30:21.966 --> 30:23.127
Have you met someone?

30:23.799 --> 30:24.877
No.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.997
Diane? I Bergeron on line 1.

30:31.966 --> 30:33.163
Alexandre.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.422
His name is Alexandre.

30:35.549 --> 30:37.753
How do you know that?
- I heard her.

30:38.132 --> 30:39.459
A cup of coffee?

30:39.716 --> 30:41.671
Alexandre how?
- I do not know.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.831
I bring your coffee immediately.

31:01.507 --> 31:03.083
That was a close call.

31:03.216 --> 31:04.957
You're not going to cry?

31:05.674 --> 31:09.371
If you do that,
You ruined my victory. Are you?

31:09.507 --> 31:11.297
It's alright. Can we?

31:20.716 --> 31:21.811
Are you?

31:21.841 --> 31:23.333
You're not going to cry?

31:23.716 --> 31:26.121
That would spoil my victory.
- All right, wise guy.

31:26.257 --> 31:27.288
Ready?

31:34.216 --> 31:37.167
You know what?
I think your arms are too short.

31:40.716 --> 31:41.959
Come on.

31:44.674 --> 31:46.250
What are you doing?

31:46.591 --> 31:47.965
Who are you laughing?

31:48.091 --> 31:50.661
I am not laughing.
- Anyway. So.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.501
Whatever.

31:54.549 --> 31:55.923
Are you going home?

31:56.049 --> 31:59.379
I said I'm going to watch football.
Do you 50 euros for me?

32:00.382 --> 32:01.661
Say...

32:03.674 --> 32:06.874
I have only 100 euros.
- That's okay.

32:10.132 --> 32:11.590
What are you going to do?

32:12.049 --> 32:15.249
We go to Fernand
for a party.

32:15.382 --> 32:16.709
Cool, dancing.

32:16.841 --> 32:18.215
I do not dance.

32:18.799 --> 32:19.913
Who are we"?

32:20.049 --> 32:22.502
You said "we".
Who are we"?

32:22.799 --> 32:25.832
Stephanie and Arnaud
and a girlfriend.

32:26.632 --> 32:28.540
I know her?
- No.

32:28.799 --> 32:30.375
Is she pretty?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.839
you go get her?

32:33.382 --> 32:35.669
You blush. You are in love.

32:35.799 --> 32:38.039
What is she doing?
- She is a lawyer.

32:38.549 --> 32:39.710
Not bad.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.965
Are you going this way?

32:42.091 --> 32:43.881
Why? Is not it good?

32:50.799 --> 32:52.292
What?
- I get 's fashion show?

32:52.507 --> 32:54.297
I show not you. Is it good or not?

32:55.632 --> 32:57.374
Wear your heels?
- Of course.

32:58.132 --> 32:59.163
Perfect.

32:59.799 --> 33:01.256
Good. I am gone.

33:01.674 --> 33:05.004
Caution in 't stadium.
I do not like large crowds.

33:05.257 --> 33:06.916
Do not worry. What is her name?

33:08.216 --> 33:10.455
Diane.
- Brunette or blonde?

33:12.841 --> 33:13.871
Blonde!

33:23.966 --> 33:25.589
Coralie has gone home?

33:25.716 --> 33:29.081
On Thursday she goes to the psychiatrist.
- Yes. That's true.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.505
Do you have plans for tonight?

33:32.591 --> 33:34.831
I thought we could ...
- I have plans.

33:38.674 --> 33:41.163
See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

37:04.007 --> 37:06.626
This intersection seems unimportant ...

37:06.882 --> 37:09.549
but here
taken one major decision.

37:13.049 --> 37:14.672
I drive to the right ...

37:15.507 --> 37:17.249
I'll bring you home ...

37:17.841 --> 37:19.250
We say goodbye ...

37:19.674 --> 37:21.416
and that was it.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.332
But I drive to the left ...

37:24.924 --> 37:26.879
then we go to my house and ...

38:33.049 --> 38:34.590
Look at me.

39:43.674 --> 39:46.672
Good morning.
- Good morning. Excuse me ...

39:48.091 --> 39:50.793
I'm Diane. I am...

39:51.257 --> 39:54.208
Benji. The son of Alexandre.
- Of course.

39:54.466 --> 39:55.923
Of course ...

39:56.132 --> 39:58.088
The resemblance is striking.

39:58.382 --> 39:59.661
I hear that a lot.

39:59.799 --> 40:02.334
But I'm not so ... mature.

40:04.091 --> 40:05.963
Is he gone?
- Yes.

40:06.299 --> 40:08.171
I think he has to Liege.

40:08.757 --> 40:11.839
When I woke up,
This was ready for me.

40:12.132 --> 40:15.545
So my father.
He makes sure no one is missing.

40:16.091 --> 40:17.631
He is great.

40:18.882 --> 40:20.505
Do you have children?

40:20.841 --> 40:21.889
No.

40:22.091 --> 40:25.373
I was married, but no children.
- Why not?

40:28.924 --> 40:32.965
At first he did not want.
After that I did not want more.

40:35.424 --> 40:37.545
Have you long been divorced?

40:38.507 --> 40:39.704
Three years.

40:40.924 --> 40:42.417
My parents were ...

40:42.549 --> 40:44.207
ten years ago from each other.

40:44.632 --> 40:46.173
But they hit it off.

40:47.299 --> 40:50.996
It's better that people
on separate intelligently

40:51.132 --> 40:53.253
Instead of fighting like idiots.

40:53.382 --> 40:54.840
Definitely.

40:55.841 --> 40:57.215
You are lucky.

40:59.882 --> 41:00.996
And you?

41:03.132 --> 41:04.210
Yes...

41:05.382 --> 41:07.041
We did 't ...

41:07.674 --> 41:09.297
on one intelligent way.

41:09.424 --> 41:10.751
So ...

41:10.882 --> 41:12.505
we have a good relationship.

41:13.132 --> 41:14.163
That's cool.

41:15.174 --> 41:16.631
Yes. Cool.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.583
Bye.

41:24.591 --> 41:27.209
See you soon?
- See you soon.

41:29.757 --> 41:31.001
Day.

41:31.591 --> 41:33.048
What are you doing?

41:33.382 --> 41:35.586
I'll do that.
- Really?

41:36.757 --> 41:38.416
There.

41:40.674 --> 41:42.878
But first, the news.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.081
Come on, girls.

42:14.091 --> 42:16.460
Are you sure?
- As sure as I see you.

42:16.966 --> 42:19.289
He came just above his door.

42:19.424 --> 42:21.959
Maybe the car seat was lowered?

42:22.091 --> 42:25.421
The kind of car was it not.
He's a dwarf.

42:26.841 --> 42:29.508
She hit a wealthy dwarf on the hook.

42:29.632 --> 42:31.789
Day.
- Bye.

42:40.716 --> 42:43.584
One cup of coffee?
- Thank you.

42:46.841 --> 42:49.673
Bruno wants to see you.
- Let him come here.

42:49.799 --> 42:52.832
I think you should be seeing him.

42:53.966 --> 42:55.542
Okay, I'll go.

43:00.466 --> 43:03.250
What is it?
- Nothing. your eyes are trembling?

43:03.382 --> 43:06.582
Yes. It's really annoying.
- Is there something bothering you?

43:07.632 --> 43:10.547
Not really.
- Is' t with your friend?

43:12.007 --> 43:13.085
Which friend?

43:13.216 --> 43:16.167
Alexandre.
Those with whom you were 't call.

43:17.507 --> 43:18.751
Yes.

43:19.882 --> 43:22.833
His name is Alexandre,
but he is ...

43:23.007 --> 43:25.045
But he is my friend,
We are no ...

43:25.174 --> 43:26.999
We go out together.

43:27.424 --> 43:29.296
Do not get on your speed.
- I will not.

43:29.424 --> 43:31.000
Are not you ashamed?
- What?

43:31.132 --> 43:32.673
He's a dwarf.

43:34.757 --> 43:35.954
Excuse me?

43:36.257 --> 43:39.705
Bruno saw you together.
He comes barely above his door.

43:42.049 --> 43:43.246
Damn.

43:46.007 --> 43:48.460
I do not know what got into me.

43:48.591 --> 43:50.795
How do you mean?
- I do not know.

43:51.632 --> 43:53.504
You are in love.

43:53.882 --> 43:55.754
I do not know.
- How do you mean?

43:55.882 --> 43:57.707
Do you love him or not?

43:58.257 --> 44:02.002
When we are together, though.
I feel in love.

44:02.132 --> 44:04.336
But when we're not together ...

44:05.841 --> 44:08.246
I see me ... or us ...
and I find it ridiculous.

44:08.382 --> 44:09.661
Why?

44:09.841 --> 44:12.839
Like any little girl
I dreamed of one great and powerful prince

44:12.966 --> 44:15.003
that would carry me to his castle.

44:15.132 --> 44:19.955
As for Santa, you know that?
You realize that that does not exist?

44:21.216 --> 44:23.420
Bruno will have a good laugh.

44:23.716 --> 44:25.706
No, I found him earlier ...

44:26.132 --> 44:29.130
Confused?
- No, rather ...

44:29.632 --> 44:32.796
Labile?
- No, rather ...

44:33.924 --> 44:35.085
stunned.

44:35.341 --> 44:37.082
That's it, stunned.

44:52.757 --> 44:55.791
You wanted to see me?
- Sit down.

45:02.007 --> 45:03.121
And?

45:04.007 --> 45:05.038
And what?

45:05.841 --> 45:07.120
What do we do?

45:08.299 --> 45:10.171
With what?
- Lefort.

45:10.799 --> 45:11.829
Therewith.

45:13.174 --> 45:16.172
Is there anything else?
- No.

45:16.591 --> 45:19.624
I stand by my position.

45:19.757 --> 45:23.205
I defend him not.
I do not want to besmirch my reputation.

45:23.341 --> 45:24.881
Okay, Snow White.

45:27.216 --> 45:28.329
What?

45:28.716 --> 45:29.877
What did you just say?

45:30.007 --> 45:32.164
I said, "Okay, Snow White."

45:33.382 --> 45:35.005
Why do you call me that?

45:35.591 --> 45:37.795
You want to stay as white as the snow.

45:39.049 --> 45:40.506
Look out, Bruno.

45:40.799 --> 45:43.418
You can not make.
- What?

45:44.132 --> 45:46.206
This.
- What, this?

45:47.132 --> 45:49.306
Me ridicule
to call me Snow White.

45:49.341 --> 45:50.538
Why not?

45:51.466 --> 45:52.579
I know you know it.

45:52.716 --> 45:54.422
What knows?
- You don 't best.

45:54.549 --> 45:57.713
You deal with one dwarf?
- Do not call me that!

45:58.007 --> 45:59.630
It's embarrassing and humiliating.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.672
And I? My ex-wife together
with one dwarf.

46:02.799 --> 46:05.370
I'm not with him.
- Does it feel the sex?

46:05.507 --> 46:07.166
I owe you no explanation.

46:07.299 --> 46:11.458
I'm fascinated. Is it an experiment?
"N Exploring the limits?

46:12.091 --> 46:13.169
Diane!

46:15.382 --> 46:18.084
This is the third time, Mathilde.
I said yes.

46:18.216 --> 46:20.786
You pay me back as soon as you can.
- Thank you.

46:20.924 --> 46:22.121
You're welcome.

46:22.591 --> 46:24.131
Still with your dentist?

46:24.257 --> 46:26.497
More or less.
- "More or less"?

46:27.882 --> 46:29.292
Will not it?

46:29.466 --> 46:31.338
Damn, I was a kid down.

46:31.799 --> 46:33.078
No, it's not a child.

46:33.757 --> 46:35.084
I did not see you.

46:36.049 --> 46:38.502
What?
- I said I had not seen.

46:38.799 --> 46:40.955
You did not see me?
- No not at all.

46:41.091 --> 46:43.046
You have not seen me?
- No.

46:44.674 --> 46:46.167
Moment.

46:47.924 --> 46:50.210
Can you see me now?
- Yes.

46:51.132 --> 46:53.123
But I had not seen you.

47:03.757 --> 47:07.502
You see me?
- Of course we see you. Come on.

47:12.924 --> 47:15.922
Do you have this in XS?
- No, I 'm sorry.

47:29.632 --> 47:31.125
How is he?

47:31.257 --> 47:33.627
What do you mean?
- How is he for his age?

47:33.757 --> 47:35.665
Is he big?
- No.

47:35.799 --> 47:39.129
He is not very big for his age.
- Take the "10 years."

47:39.299 --> 47:42.416
I took that for my 11 year old son
and he's perfect.

47:42.841 --> 47:44.038
How old is yours?

47:44.757 --> 47:46.997
Slightly older.

47:47.132 --> 47:49.418
Okay. I take the "10 years."

47:51.132 --> 47:53.502
Packing?
- No, thank you.

48:04.632 --> 48:05.746
Everything fine?

48:06.091 --> 48:08.793
We're going to go south?
I only beach gear with me.

48:10.966 --> 48:12.245
We go to the north?

48:13.132 --> 48:14.922
Who said we go somewhere?

48:15.507 --> 48:18.955
It's my birthday and we agree
on the airport...

48:20.257 --> 48:21.536
Sit down.

48:29.382 --> 48:31.539
Did I ever tell you my tractor story?

48:32.132 --> 48:33.210
No.

48:36.091 --> 48:37.631
When I was little...

48:37.757 --> 48:40.921
I mean, when I was a child,
We lived next to one farm.

48:41.299 --> 48:44.167
You know,
besides grandfather Leon.

48:44.799 --> 48:46.873
On the farm they had a tractor.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.124
I dreamed of driving it.

48:50.716 --> 48:54.164
My father said, "Ask 't to the farmer."
But I did not dare.

48:55.132 --> 48:56.625
On one day, on my birthday ...

48:57.424 --> 49:01.003
said my father:
"I spoke with the farmer and it's okay."

49:01.132 --> 49:03.881
I was going crazy.
I walked to the farm ...

49:05.007 --> 49:07.875
and I realized that the man
was not up to date.

49:08.466 --> 49:12.127
But it was too late,
I stood there for him.

49:12.257 --> 49:13.916
I had to continue.

49:14.174 --> 49:17.374
I told him that I dreamed
with his tractor to drive ...

49:18.382 --> 49:19.709
and he agreed.

49:23.924 --> 49:25.465
When I got home ...

49:26.466 --> 49:28.871
said my father that I
had two reasons to be happy.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.871
One, I had driven the tractor.

49:32.966 --> 49:35.086
Two, I had myself seen to that.

49:42.882 --> 49:44.458
See that man there?

49:49.257 --> 49:50.419
Timo Atanen.

49:51.174 --> 49:52.501
The inaccessible.

49:54.007 --> 49:56.922
He has a flight to Los Angeles
at 15.00.

49:57.049 --> 49:58.328
So you ...

49:58.924 --> 50:01.294
20 minutes to get him
to talk about your project.

50:02.966 --> 50:05.289
He is aware. I have spoken to him.

50:05.424 --> 50:07.331
He will be happy to listen to you.

50:28.257 --> 50:29.335
He was a little further.

50:29.466 --> 50:32.748
I had not seen him.
Dad said, "Look over there."

50:32.882 --> 50:35.666
So I step on him down
and tell him about my project.

50:35.799 --> 50:39.709
He says nothing.
He stares at me normally.

50:40.007 --> 50:41.121
Then he says ...

50:41.757 --> 50:44.791
"Interesting project.
Call me, we'll talk. "

50:44.924 --> 50:47.294
I stood there, motionless ...

50:47.424 --> 50:50.541
and he gives me his card
with his telephone number.

50:50.674 --> 50:53.755
I Timo Atanens phone!
Cool, right?

50:54.674 --> 50:55.953
Moment!

50:57.632 --> 50:59.173
Maybe he is!

51:02.299 --> 51:04.539
It's Max.
I have to tell him.

51:05.007 --> 51:06.666
Do not forget dessert!

51:07.424 --> 51:10.126
I'm talking phone
Timo Atanen, really.

51:10.299 --> 51:11.543
Crazy, huh?

51:12.924 --> 51:14.547
What you did was amazing.

51:14.674 --> 51:17.376
I did not do much.
- Anyway.

51:18.007 --> 51:20.875
He did it himself,
with his own arguments.

51:22.091 --> 51:23.500
I am proud.

51:26.466 --> 51:27.514
Present.

51:28.382 --> 51:30.172
What do you mean "gift"?

51:37.632 --> 51:39.836
Do you like anything?
- I did not say that.

51:40.007 --> 51:42.626
I thought, I said to myself,
quite original.

51:42.757 --> 51:46.087
You'll find him not fun.
- Just kidding, I like him.

51:46.674 --> 51:48.250
Really?
- Yes.

51:48.382 --> 51:53.039
Every day I will find him better.
He will get better and better.

51:53.507 --> 51:56.078
I'm sorry, I'm not used ...

51:56.757 --> 51:58.416
get gifts.

52:00.716 --> 52:01.877
Why not?

52:05.882 --> 52:08.750
Because I do not often get gifts.

52:08.882 --> 52:11.168
It's a long time ago.

52:13.882 --> 52:15.589
It makes me very happy.

52:18.882 --> 52:21.916
A transparent glass floor ...

52:22.049 --> 52:23.210
No no.

52:23.341 --> 52:27.417
Then it is too classic, too boring.
Let us be bolder.

52:27.549 --> 52:29.705
We should 't see more ...

52:30.924 --> 52:32.002
What?

52:34.007 --> 52:35.334
What is it?

52:37.549 --> 52:39.042
Why are you laughing?

52:39.382 --> 52:42.215
I'm not believable when I talk
on "see more"?

52:49.716 --> 52:52.121
If I do say so, is it better?

53:02.007 --> 53:03.630
Help me off, I'm afraid of heights.

53:05.132 --> 53:06.590
Okay ...

53:08.424 --> 53:11.457
Really?
- No one picks something off me.

53:11.591 --> 53:13.914
You laugh, but it's important.

53:14.716 --> 53:16.422
You have to do something about it.

53:22.132 --> 53:23.957
Can I ask you something?

53:27.716 --> 53:29.753
How long are you going to hide me?

53:30.341 --> 53:31.833
I do not hide.

53:33.549 --> 53:34.876
How do you mean?

53:35.007 --> 53:37.792
I had no chance just yet ...

53:39.757 --> 53:41.215
Stop that.

53:42.966 --> 53:45.454
I have no problem with our relationship.

53:46.424 --> 53:47.538
Really.

53:50.257 --> 53:51.371
Okay.

53:51.757 --> 53:52.919
Thank you.

54:01.591 --> 54:03.747
It's always the same.

54:04.299 --> 54:05.377
What?

54:07.091 --> 54:10.586
The women I go out
refuse to introduce me to friends.

54:10.716 --> 54:14.046
They are afraid that they will be jealous.
It's a problem.

54:17.382 --> 54:20.830
Really,
'T have anything to do with you.

54:21.507 --> 54:25.122
I see my friends less often
since my separation from Bruno.

54:25.257 --> 54:26.631
That's the reason.

54:29.132 --> 54:31.538
I see them less often because I think ...

54:32.049 --> 54:37.039
I do not know, but they seem
less at ease now that I'm alone.

54:37.174 --> 54:38.453
And your parents?

54:38.632 --> 54:40.291
What's with my parents?

54:41.049 --> 54:42.874
they are also less at ease?

54:45.591 --> 54:48.161
Would you like to meet my parents?
- Why not?

54:48.924 --> 54:50.203
Okay.

54:52.757 --> 54:56.667
I see my mother and stepfather
at one exhibition tomorrow. You may come.

55:05.924 --> 55:06.972
I'll be there.

55:07.841 --> 55:09.250
I hope so.

55:11.882 --> 55:13.079
It's fun.

55:34.174 --> 55:37.042
I can not explain.
These pictures make me ...

55:37.174 --> 55:38.667
Me too.

55:38.799 --> 55:42.378
You feel so connected
the artist is rare, right?

55:44.341 --> 55:45.833
Do you think they like?

55:46.924 --> 55:49.875
You say nothing.
- Yes, they are good.

55:50.049 --> 55:52.040
Look at this.

55:53.591 --> 55:55.214
Yes. He is...

55:56.841 --> 55:58.547
I think the same way.

55:58.799 --> 56:02.496
I do not think that Philippe would be glad
If I were one to take.

56:03.757 --> 56:05.748
They do not seem to him to be disappointing.

56:05.882 --> 56:08.797
The only thing that excites him is the price.

56:08.924 --> 56:11.543
He sometimes brings
with such ugly things.

56:13.091 --> 56:14.584
Look, one dwarf.

56:17.924 --> 56:19.749
Do you know him?

56:25.007 --> 56:26.797
How are you?
- Good and how are you?

56:28.341 --> 56:29.964
I will introduce you?
- Yes.

56:32.757 --> 56:36.170
This is Alexandre, a friend.
Nicole, my mother.

56:36.549 --> 56:37.876
Pleasant.

56:38.007 --> 56:40.081
Christine, an old friend.

56:40.216 --> 56:42.337
Pleasant.
- You too.

56:42.674 --> 56:44.001
Do you want something to drink?

56:44.132 --> 56:46.585
Like.
- A glass of champagne?

56:53.257 --> 56:55.876
You like it?
- Very.

56:56.049 --> 56:58.620
I love the Superman aspect.
- The what?

56:58.757 --> 57:00.084
Übermensch.

57:01.799 --> 57:04.797
Super Man.
I can identify myself with it.

57:14.882 --> 57:17.916
Architecture you interested?

57:18.132 --> 57:19.957
My father ...

57:20.424 --> 57:23.339
trained in the visual arts
by Haug-us Per-rot.

57:23.406 --> 57:24.412
By who?

57:24.441 --> 57:27.273
Haug-us Per-rot.
The architect of La-va.

57:27.549 --> 57:30.216
Auguste Perret. Le Havre.
- Okay.

57:30.382 --> 57:32.089
He loved tampon.

57:33.757 --> 57:36.755
He loved concrete!
- I understand.

57:37.757 --> 57:40.162
Concrete's a great resource.

57:40.299 --> 57:42.089
You can do a lot with it.

57:42.216 --> 57:46.423
My father was one pioneer.
He was hard of hearing, just like me.

57:46.549 --> 57:48.006
Is it hereditary?

57:48.507 --> 57:50.083
He was deaf.

57:50.216 --> 57:53.380
He asks if it's hereditary.
- I understand.

57:54.174 --> 57:56.414
And with you?
- Not at all.

57:57.007 --> 57:59.958
In your family, everyone is big?
- Yeah, but me.

58:00.091 --> 58:01.963
Even a bottle of wine?

58:02.091 --> 58:05.089
I'm the only one.
It was a growing problem.

58:05.216 --> 58:06.329
Waiter!

58:07.216 --> 58:10.629
What are you doing, Nicole?
- I take care of my garden.

58:11.507 --> 58:15.501
But I worked for many years
with my first husband, Diane's father.

58:15.632 --> 58:17.006
A textile company.

58:17.132 --> 58:18.708
Do you remember?
- Yes.

58:18.841 --> 58:21.164
That was something.

58:21.841 --> 58:24.673
Now it is gardening?
- Indeed.

58:24.841 --> 58:27.460
We discovered one common passion.

58:27.591 --> 58:29.581
Excuse me, I'll be back.

58:29.716 --> 58:33.247
We tried to grow vegetables,
but that did not work out.

58:33.507 --> 58:36.955
Day.
Your neck is not too stiff?

58:37.091 --> 58:39.414
We can sit a little closer?

58:39.549 --> 58:42.002
I would not want to miss you something.

58:46.882 --> 58:48.754
The coffee.
- Thank you.

58:51.174 --> 58:53.663
Alexandre way?
- The reception was poor.

58:53.799 --> 58:55.340
What was bad?

58:55.757 --> 58:57.167
His phone signal.

58:57.299 --> 58:59.870
He got one call
and went out to meet him.

59:00.716 --> 59:02.623
Why are you so excited?

59:02.799 --> 59:05.122
I'm not excited.
Not at all.

59:05.632 --> 59:08.583
Did you know that he is building an opera in Liege?

59:08.716 --> 59:10.956
Yes, it is rather one extension.

59:11.091 --> 59:14.255
Yet...
That little guy's a great architect.

59:14.382 --> 59:15.626
Mom...
- What?

59:15.757 --> 59:17.036
Come on.

59:17.757 --> 59:21.123
He's a huge mosquito fart
and handles large projects.

59:21.257 --> 59:22.880
Do you hear what you're saying?

59:23.007 --> 59:26.005
What got into you tonight?
I find him great.

59:26.174 --> 59:28.248
How did you know m?

59:28.924 --> 59:30.002
Does he have a client?

59:31.299 --> 59:32.543
Yes.

59:34.299 --> 59:36.669
Just like your father
no sacrifice too great to you.

59:37.299 --> 59:40.463
I do not understand.
- He is completely away from you.

59:40.591 --> 59:42.416
'S State to read on his face.

59:42.549 --> 59:45.831
Not at all.
- He can not wait.

59:46.174 --> 59:49.006
He reminds me
the dog of Mrs. Lemaire.

59:49.132 --> 59:51.455
He wanted the female Mrs Francu
pounce.

59:51.591 --> 59:53.083
Remember, Philippe?

59:53.216 --> 59:54.590
But yeah.

59:55.091 --> 59:56.714
Does this really work?

59:56.841 --> 01:00:00.088
I'm sorry.
we can not amuse us?

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.955
Look, he pays.

01:00:04.591 --> 01:00:05.788
Keep him on.

01:00:05.924 --> 01:00:08.045
Let him, if he feels like it.

01:00:08.174 --> 01:00:10.544
He will himself feel important by.

01:00:11.966 --> 01:00:13.340
It's certainly not easy.

01:00:21.424 --> 01:00:23.130
That's it.

01:00:26.299 --> 01:00:27.578
What's wrong?

01:00:28.674 --> 01:00:29.953
Can I continue to believe?

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:32.006
Believe in what?

01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:34.375
In our.

01:00:34.716 --> 01:00:38.626
What? I've just proposed
to my mother and stepfather.

01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:43.627
Listen...

01:00:50.716 --> 01:00:52.506
It's not easy.

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:55.373
I do not see what's so hard.

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:59.039
You take a lot of space.
- I?

01:00:59.174 --> 01:01:00.501
Yes you.

01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:03.798
I ask myself constantly wondering
if I have enough attention to you

01:01:03.924 --> 01:01:05.714
if I did not hurt your feelings.

01:01:05.841 --> 01:01:07.298
'T Is always about you.

01:01:07.632 --> 01:01:08.663
Not at all.

01:01:09.007 --> 01:01:10.500
But if it feels so much for me.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:21.167
I did not expect someone
if you fall, 't hit me.

01:01:21.424 --> 01:01:25.548
It's great, but I have everything
unconditionally accept?

01:01:25.674 --> 01:01:28.376
Even with one normal man is it not so.

01:01:29.507 --> 01:01:31.297
Sorry, I did not mean it.

01:01:32.507 --> 01:01:35.422
Damn! That's exactly what I meant.
It's not easy.

01:01:35.924 --> 01:01:39.455
I'm sure other women
you let sit for it.

01:01:39.632 --> 01:01:41.291
Because it's not easy.

01:01:43.424 --> 01:01:44.668
I'm wrong?

01:01:46.924 --> 01:01:47.937
No.

01:01:52.716 --> 01:01:54.374
Can I continue?

01:02:00.757 --> 01:02:02.547
Continue to argue? No.

01:02:15.216 --> 01:02:17.041
No, Luchio. Not tonight.

01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:25.673
I warned you.

01:02:28.716 --> 01:02:33.005
Be careful what you say.
I can sue you for slander.

01:02:34.966 --> 01:02:36.209
Listen...

01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.666
where did you hear that?

01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:40.836
Bruno was sleeping with the judge?

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:44.422
I'm sorry, the moral of Carsoni
There is no doubt.

01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:46.125
What?
- You have a visitor.

01:02:46.257 --> 01:02:47.501
Who?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.171
Alexandre?
- Yes.

01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:53.997
Okay, let's change of judge.

01:02:54.216 --> 01:02:56.123
I said ok. Day.

01:02:56.257 --> 01:02:58.461
He is such a sweetheart, you'd like to m ...

01:02:58.591 --> 01:02:59.788
Bruno there?
- Yes.

01:02:59.924 --> 01:03:01.333
I do not want him'm seeing.

01:03:01.924 --> 01:03:03.582
I do not want them to come together.

01:03:16.007 --> 01:03:17.381
Day.

01:03:17.507 --> 01:03:21.086
I was in the neighborhood
and wanted to see where you work.

01:03:21.216 --> 01:03:23.455
Good idea.
- A great idea.

01:03:25.091 --> 01:03:27.496
This is Coralie, our assistant.

01:03:27.632 --> 01:03:29.753
We've already met.

01:03:29.966 --> 01:03:32.040
We said 't the same time!

01:03:32.382 --> 01:03:35.830
I still work.
Will you come to my office?

01:03:35.966 --> 01:03:37.209
Beautiful sculpture.

01:03:37.341 --> 01:03:39.213
'S gift from her ex-father-in

01:03:39.341 --> 01:03:41.829
Father Bruno, her partner.

01:03:41.966 --> 01:03:44.999
A cup of coffee?
A cup of tea? Something else?

01:03:45.132 --> 01:03:47.004
A glass of water?

01:03:47.132 --> 01:03:48.459
Do you come?

01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:52.750
I have to deal with two issues.
- Go ahead.

01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:04.628
I did not know you had curls.

01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:07.088
Do you feel better?
- No.

01:04:10.091 --> 01:04:12.211
Are you crazy?
- Why?

01:04:12.341 --> 01:04:14.710
We can not change right!

01:04:14.882 --> 01:04:16.989
Now this does not come out.
- I do not give a hoot!

01:04:17.007 --> 01:04:18.749
You realize you but what does?

01:04:18.904 --> 01:04:20.478
You're doing it!
- This is not 't moment.

01:04:20.494 --> 01:04:21.951
I do not give a hoot!

01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:23.423
Answer!
- Stop!

01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:25.835
I want a reply. I'm not leaving ...

01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:28.500
This is busy.

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:33.250
Stay down.
- No.

01:04:34.674 --> 01:04:37.921
Alexandre. Bruno.
- Pleasant.

01:04:39.216 --> 01:04:41.585
I'm sorry, I did not know ...

01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:43.340
Is knocking an option?

01:04:43.466 --> 01:04:45.705
I'm sorry.
I have his glass of water.

01:04:49.174 --> 01:04:51.745
I have not quite filled him
not to spill.

01:04:51.882 --> 01:04:55.958
And, surprise.
I brought a straw.

01:04:57.674 --> 01:05:00.209
We put this conversation elsewhere on.

01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:04.421
Give me five minutes.

01:05:06.466 --> 01:05:08.622
I will stay with you.
- Yes.

01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:19.667
Right slept?

01:05:19.799 --> 01:05:22.797
He's not really a dwarf.
- Did you sleep with her?

01:05:22.924 --> 01:05:24.500
He is rather a Lilliputian.

01:05:24.632 --> 01:05:28.128
He is small, period.
It is the hyper phase ... hypo ...

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.378
The pituitary gland.
- Yes.

01:05:30.674 --> 01:05:32.499
Did you do it?
- What does it matter?

01:05:32.632 --> 01:05:34.125
Are you jealous?

01:05:34.299 --> 01:05:37.463
What do you have?
Previously you did everything to win.

01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:39.830
I changed.
- No, you've given up.

01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:44.045
A theory exists
about successful people and guilt.

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:47.374
One day it will be too much for them
and they ruin everything.

01:05:47.507 --> 01:05:48.917
Do not be so stupid.
- Look at you.

01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:52.130
You dump me, you ruining firm
and you fall for a dwarf.

01:05:52.257 --> 01:05:54.047
That is the behavior of a loser.

01:05:54.174 --> 01:05:58.038
These "dwarf," as you call him,
more than average. He's extraordinary.

01:05:58.174 --> 01:06:00.663
Compared to him, you even ...

01:06:00.841 --> 01:06:03.376
not so great. You're nothing.

01:07:00.591 --> 01:07:01.669
Leave her alone.

01:07:03.507 --> 01:07:05.628
I remained calm so far.

01:07:05.757 --> 01:07:07.380
Did you follow me?
- No.

01:07:07.507 --> 01:07:11.832
Your story with Diane's over.
She's with me, forget it.

01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:13.542
Are you threatening me?

01:07:14.091 --> 01:07:16.414
I say that my patience has limits.

01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:18.255
Unbelievable.

01:07:20.132 --> 01:07:21.625
Come on, get out.

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:26.998
Think you gauge scares me?

01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:29.206
I determine the boundaries.

01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:32.043
Diane made one choice,
and you're not.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:34.841
I'm gonna give you a blow, you idiot.
- Idiot?

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:36.873
Do not say that.

01:07:39.091 --> 01:07:42.456
Come on.
- Hey! Take someone your own size!

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.665
Dwarf, fly him to the throat!

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:46.340
Come on, come on.

01:08:11.091 --> 01:08:13.414
Okay. Now you have understood the message,

01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:15.640
I suggest that we act
as adults.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:17.747
I give a party Saturday.

01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:21.082
You have to come.
Diane will be happy.

01:08:21.216 --> 01:08:25.872
It proves that you are friends,
you accept her new life.

01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:28.875
Come on. Until Saturday.

01:08:37.716 --> 01:08:39.706
Glad we do something together.

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:43.336
It's a long time ago.
Thus, we can talk.

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:46.130
Have you met someone?

01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:48.711
You're unbelievable.
- I know you.

01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:50.084
Is it serious?

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:55.078
Is he married? Divorced?
No client whose ex has ruined him?

01:08:55.216 --> 01:08:56.246
Obviously not.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:58.461
Who is it? I know him?

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:00.131
Yes.

01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:01.750
Tell me!

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:04.127
It is Alexandre.

01:09:04.256 --> 01:09:05.880
Alexandre ...

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:08.127
The son of Berthot?
- No, he did not.

01:09:08.256 --> 01:09:10.247
It's Alexandre ...

01:09:11.049 --> 01:09:13.170
We ate together last week.

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:20.871
What are you doing?

01:09:21.006 --> 01:09:23.081
Nothing, honey. You said?

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.912
I love Alexandre
and I want to marry him.

01:09:26.049 --> 01:09:27.246
Of course.

01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:34.502
Mom! Pay attention!

01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:37.589
He is a man like any other!
- Of course, baby.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:42.496
No, not like the other men.

01:09:42.674 --> 01:09:45.044
He puts it head and shoulders above the rest.

01:09:45.174 --> 01:09:46.631
Absolutely.

01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:51.207
The only
what is of interest to you ...

01:09:51.756 --> 01:09:53.546
I listen, honey.

01:09:53.674 --> 01:09:56.755
The only thing that is important to you,
is my happiness.

01:09:56.882 --> 01:09:59.169
Yes, you're lucky.

01:09:59.299 --> 01:10:00.543
Nothing else.

01:10:10.257 --> 01:10:13.255
What's he doing there?
Come on back.

01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:16.000
Unbelievable.

01:10:25.507 --> 01:10:26.704
It's great here.

01:10:27.799 --> 01:10:29.836
For you it's probably still bigger.

01:10:30.174 --> 01:10:32.627
You see?
has its advantages small.

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:36.007
Are there toilets?
- Over there.

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:37.459
Thanks.

01:10:40.049 --> 01:10:41.506
Everything fine?
- Yes.

01:10:41.966 --> 01:10:43.755
I have not seen your mother.

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:46.794
No me neither. Strange.

01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.661
Where's Ruby?
They must serve the people.

01:10:49.799 --> 01:10:51.624
Excuse me.

01:10:52.591 --> 01:10:53.918
Monique?

01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:06.706
Napkins ...

01:11:23.174 --> 01:11:24.269
Damn!

01:11:26.841 --> 01:11:27.919
Damn!

01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:31.756
What are you doing? Pullup exercises?

01:11:32.424 --> 01:11:33.668
I'm going to fall.

01:11:34.382 --> 01:11:37.546
I'll call Diane,
then she can admire her hero.

01:11:37.674 --> 01:11:39.131
No do not do that!

01:11:39.757 --> 01:11:41.547
You can not stop me ... Diane!

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.875
You're petty.

01:11:44.007 --> 01:11:46.840
Are you proud that you
one woman have stolen?

01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:49.750
She's not your wife.
- Yours too much longer.

01:11:56.382 --> 01:11:58.254
Nobody wins here.

01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:00.705
Beat me like a man.

01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.499
In a duel?

01:12:02.799 --> 01:12:04.706
Yes.
- With swords? Guns?

01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:07.788
I thought of football.
- No.

01:12:08.216 --> 01:12:10.123
No, I do not.

01:12:11.507 --> 01:12:12.621
Table tennis?

01:12:18.216 --> 01:12:19.839
Alexandre?
- Yes?

01:12:22.632 --> 01:12:24.208
Did you call me?

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.555
Yes.

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.829
Can you help with the petit fours?

01:12:29.841 --> 01:12:31.084
Yes.

01:12:39.716 --> 01:12:41.374
Are there any napkins?

01:12:42.507 --> 01:12:45.340
Can you get the napkins here, Bruno?

01:12:46.757 --> 01:12:48.001
Of course.

01:12:53.841 --> 01:12:55.878
You are going to die.
- Yes of course.

01:13:09.591 --> 01:13:10.704
Stupid dog.

01:13:18.341 --> 01:13:20.461
Who do you write?

01:13:21.549 --> 01:13:22.876
Not your business.

01:13:25.174 --> 01:13:27.958
Diane.
I'm worried about her.

01:13:28.132 --> 01:13:29.957
She has a new boyfriend.

01:13:30.632 --> 01:13:32.042
The little guy?

01:13:32.382 --> 01:13:33.460
How do you know that?

01:13:35.132 --> 01:13:36.673
It was not difficult to guess.

01:13:36.799 --> 01:13:39.714
And you like it?
Is it normal?

01:13:40.132 --> 01:13:41.673
Philippe ...

01:13:42.007 --> 01:13:43.879
She goes out with an invalid.

01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:46.872
You also lives with a disability.

01:13:47.007 --> 01:13:50.254
What do you mean?
That is not the same.

01:13:50.382 --> 01:13:54.376
You do not hear well.
That is not the same. It is not physical.

01:13:54.507 --> 01:13:57.340
What I mean ... you do not see it!

01:13:57.466 --> 01:14:00.582
Damn! You know what I mean!

01:14:01.174 --> 01:14:04.374
You're right.
I am with a disability.

01:14:05.132 --> 01:14:06.246
Philippe.

01:14:26.382 --> 01:14:27.544
Damn.

01:14:42.507 --> 01:14:43.704
An icecream?

01:14:44.174 --> 01:14:45.252
No thanks.

01:14:45.382 --> 01:14:46.875
You waiting for?

01:14:55.632 --> 01:14:56.794
Day.

01:14:57.216 --> 01:14:58.495
Day!

01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:00.499
My son, Auguste.

01:15:00.716 --> 01:15:01.781
Day.

01:15:02.257 --> 01:15:03.288
Day.

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.834
And yours? Was the right size?

01:15:07.632 --> 01:15:09.090
Yes, definitely.

01:15:09.257 --> 01:15:10.419
Amazing.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.204
Day.

01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:14.854
Day.

01:15:19.299 --> 01:15:20.756
Perfect.

01:15:22.882 --> 01:15:24.423
It does not matter.

01:15:26.882 --> 01:15:28.790
Diane, it's okay.

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:36.129
Is everything alright?
- Yes.

01:15:42.882 --> 01:15:44.256
Sit down.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:55.918
Are you angry?

01:15:57.341 --> 01:16:00.090
Not you?
- On what?

01:16:00.216 --> 01:16:02.585
The life that you did so.

01:16:04.216 --> 01:16:06.123
I've never known anything else.

01:16:07.882 --> 01:16:10.999
I was first big,
I might be wrong.

01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:14.916
Are you angry that you are blonde?

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:21.589
Are you angry because I'm small?
- Come on.

01:16:21.841 --> 01:16:24.127
How can I be mad at you?

01:16:27.841 --> 01:16:29.796
It's painful.

01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:33.247
Pain, I know.

01:16:37.799 --> 01:16:39.589
What is the most painful?

01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:41.583
My neck.

01:16:54.049 --> 01:16:56.502
You've never been in love with someone
of your size?

01:16:57.007 --> 01:16:58.548
Yeah, when I was five.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.505
But she has continued to grow.

01:17:11.382 --> 01:17:13.788
You are an extraordinary man.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.126
Do you know?

01:17:20.882 --> 01:17:22.672
With you I feel ...

01:17:22.841 --> 01:17:25.625
loved. Understood as well.
That rarely happens.

01:17:28.216 --> 01:17:30.171
I miss you when you're not around.

01:17:30.966 --> 01:17:32.921
I learn every day.

01:17:34.299 --> 01:17:36.336
You make the world bigger.

01:17:36.799 --> 01:17:39.085
It's strange but it's true.

01:17:44.466 --> 01:17:46.456
I want to be with you...

01:17:47.424 --> 01:17:49.995
I really want it ...

01:17:55.549 --> 01:17:57.172
But you can not.

01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:08.041
I asked you, Diane.

01:18:09.716 --> 01:18:11.374
"Can I continue to believe?"

01:18:12.341 --> 01:18:15.374
Do you remember?
"Can I continue to believe in us?"

01:18:18.757 --> 01:18:21.292
I'm not a 1,80 m or 1.36 m.

01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:25.379
I never hid it.
You have not just discovered.

01:18:28.882 --> 01:18:31.453
I know. I know.

01:18:33.049 --> 01:18:36.829
And I know
that we are the most important ...

01:18:36.966 --> 01:18:39.536
that the others do not count,
but I can not let it go.

01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:43.170
They are all those images
how love should be.

01:18:43.841 --> 01:18:45.997
They're your images.

01:18:51.799 --> 01:18:53.256
Go home.

01:18:56.591 --> 01:18:58.000
Go home.

01:20:13.174 --> 01:20:15.923
We need an agreement
The Mayor

01:20:16.049 --> 01:20:18.833
for the ministry approves it.

01:20:19.007 --> 01:20:20.121
Of course.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.584
Monique! You're already there
ten minutes doing.

01:20:23.757 --> 01:20:25.629
You can do something else.

01:20:28.341 --> 01:20:31.872
The yard will be halted,
such as in Stockholm.

01:20:32.007 --> 01:20:33.465
Hold on, please.

01:20:34.216 --> 01:20:37.083
Take off the dust.
Do that later.

01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:38.876
Yes...

01:20:40.091 --> 01:20:43.421
It is serious.
They loved the green image.

01:20:43.549 --> 01:20:45.504
We can start over.

01:20:46.882 --> 01:20:48.126
Unbelievable.

01:20:48.882 --> 01:20:50.126
Monique!

01:20:53.799 --> 01:20:56.916
Can not you see I'm on the phone?
- Can not you see I vacuum?

01:20:57.049 --> 01:20:58.839
You must know what you want.

01:20:59.507 --> 01:21:01.664
If it is, I'm gone!

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:05.084
Call me when you've calmed down.

01:21:23.257 --> 01:21:24.454
How are you?

01:21:24.882 --> 01:21:26.292
Good thanks.

01:21:28.966 --> 01:21:31.501
Remember her, dad.
She is not worth it.

01:21:32.632 --> 01:21:33.876
She's worth it.

01:21:35.216 --> 01:21:36.839
She did what she could.

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:43.663
How do you see me?

01:21:45.591 --> 01:21:47.000
What do you mean?

01:21:47.591 --> 01:21:49.167
How do you see me?

01:21:50.674 --> 01:21:52.795
See you in different ways.

01:21:53.299 --> 01:21:54.626
As a father.

01:21:55.007 --> 01:21:56.832
As a talented architect.

01:21:58.257 --> 01:21:59.833
As a friend sometimes.

01:22:01.257 --> 01:22:02.750
And my size?

01:22:04.674 --> 01:22:06.416
It has never disturbed?

01:22:12.424 --> 01:22:14.498
When I was little, I did not realize it.

01:22:15.174 --> 01:22:17.544
I began to notice
how people looked at you

01:22:18.049 --> 01:22:19.839
when I was a teenager.

01:22:20.466 --> 01:22:22.871
My friends, their parents,

01:22:23.299 --> 01:22:25.124
the other kids at school ...

01:22:25.257 --> 01:22:26.964
But I did not care.

01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:29.081
Because they do not care you.

01:22:33.591 --> 01:22:35.830
Does it always hurt?

01:22:35.966 --> 01:22:37.672
Of course.

01:22:41.632 --> 01:22:44.630
Either people stare too much,
either they do not see me.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:48.460
I pretend it does not bother me,
but that is a lie.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:52.747
I lie to myself,
to others, even to you.

01:22:52.882 --> 01:22:55.086
They are not lies. It is courage.

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.499
And you have your dignity.

01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:02.088
I see in you.

01:23:03.507 --> 01:23:04.881
Dignity.

01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:13.082
I'm tired of being small.

01:23:17.549 --> 01:23:19.042
Your Honor.

01:23:21.091 --> 01:23:23.212
Master Berthier.
- Bye.

01:23:23.341 --> 01:23:26.090
You defend the man of my client?
- Right.

01:23:26.882 --> 01:23:28.672
You are...
- Gaëlle Lefort.

01:23:28.799 --> 01:23:31.169
The wife of your client. Ex-wife.

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:33.332
Pleasant.

01:23:38.424 --> 01:23:41.043
Am I interrupting?
- Not at all.

01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:47.293
What are you doing?
- I pretend to work.

01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:52.792
Thanks for laughing.
That is a long time ago.

01:23:53.466 --> 01:23:55.255
Now you're in a good mood,

01:23:55.382 --> 01:23:58.333
I said Lefort
we do not represent him anymore.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.923
Did you do that?

01:24:00.049 --> 01:24:03.000
You're right, ethically plane
is no compromise possible.

01:24:03.632 --> 01:24:06.583
I am surprised.
I'm impressed.

01:24:06.716 --> 01:24:08.090
I did not see it.

01:24:08.216 --> 01:24:11.332
He's a bastard to his ex
treat like a piece of dirt.

01:24:11.466 --> 01:24:13.540
Absolutely!
I'm glad you understand.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.914
That is why we are going to defend her.

01:24:17.507 --> 01:24:18.520
Excuse me?

01:24:18.716 --> 01:24:21.121
His ex, Gaëlle.
We defend her.

01:24:22.966 --> 01:24:24.510
You went to bed with her.

01:24:24.632 --> 01:24:26.006
It's not over.

01:24:28.257 --> 01:24:30.248
You're incorrigible.
- What's the problem?

01:24:30.382 --> 01:24:33.795
His money is in Luxembourg.
She has tons of proof.

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:35.666
We ruin him.
- You're crazy.

01:24:35.799 --> 01:24:36.960
We'll be rich!

01:24:37.466 --> 01:24:38.923
My God.

01:24:39.299 --> 01:24:40.626
Diane, listen!

01:24:40.757 --> 01:24:42.333
Why do not you trust me?

01:26:03.882 --> 01:26:05.256
Alexandre here?

01:26:06.341 --> 01:26:07.354
No.

01:26:08.799 --> 01:26:10.624
Is he in Liege?
- Maybe.

01:26:11.049 --> 01:26:12.956
Do you know when he'll be back?

01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:17.752
do not treat me so.
I'm not your enemy.

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:19.298
How do I treat you?

01:26:20.132 --> 01:26:22.372
It's too complicated for me.

01:26:22.549 --> 01:26:24.006
Complicated?

01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:26.416
You've hurt him enough.

01:26:26.716 --> 01:26:28.422
Leave him alone.

01:26:29.174 --> 01:26:31.414
He's my father and I love him.

01:26:32.716 --> 01:26:34.208
Let him.

01:26:45.341 --> 01:26:47.082
In fact, you're the dwarf.

01:26:48.216 --> 01:26:51.249
You're an emotional dwarf.
Your body is normal,

01:26:51.382 --> 01:26:53.705
but you're small on the inside.

01:26:53.882 --> 01:26:56.999
A small heart
and small feelings.

01:26:59.507 --> 01:27:02.541
But it's normal.
It stems from childhood.

01:27:02.674 --> 01:27:07.213
They gave us stereotypes.
We are formatted.

01:27:07.341 --> 01:27:10.541
And when one is slightly different,
We can not accept that.

01:27:10.674 --> 01:27:11.953
You're right.

01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:13.418
We can not stand it.

01:27:13.549 --> 01:27:16.961
Everyone should be the same.
You should know what?

01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:19.046
We're Nazis. We are.

01:27:19.174 --> 01:27:21.378
A gang damn Nazis!

01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:28.292
Honey.

01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:44.583
I'm sorry, baby.

01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:47.334
That's touching,
but some late.

01:27:47.466 --> 01:27:49.540
Why?
- He refuses to talk to her.

01:27:49.674 --> 01:27:51.297
It's never too late.

01:27:51.424 --> 01:27:53.166
Go to him and show

01:27:53.299 --> 01:27:55.254
what you really feel for him.
Where is he?

01:27:56.341 --> 01:27:58.959
In Liege, I think.
- Go directly.

01:27:59.091 --> 01:28:02.835
What should I say?
- Does not matter. He must not hear you.

01:28:03.174 --> 01:28:04.964
He must just see.

01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:44.626
Okay, here we are.

01:28:44.799 --> 01:28:47.797
I'm going to jump.

01:28:47.966 --> 01:28:50.040
Three.

01:28:51.257 --> 01:28:52.419
A...

01:28:53.549 --> 01:28:54.793
two...

01:28:57.924 --> 01:28:59.298
A...

01:29:00.257 --> 01:29:01.584
two...

01:29:04.799 --> 01:29:09.124
Sorry, what's better?
One, two and jump

01:29:09.299 --> 01:29:12.332
or one, two, three and jump?

01:29:14.174 --> 01:29:15.964
Well, okay.

01:29:43.299 --> 01:29:45.254
Alexandre, it's Diane!

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.458
Alexandre, it's me!

01:30:55.924 --> 01:30:58.413
The parachute was a bad idea.

01:31:00.299 --> 01:31:02.918
But I wanted to show you
I have no fear anymore.

01:31:05.007 --> 01:31:07.330
I'm ready to go for it.

01:31:08.007 --> 01:31:09.915
It was a metaphor.

01:31:12.091 --> 01:31:14.165
But who cares about metaphors?

01:31:18.216 --> 01:31:20.336
I just wanted to say I love you.

01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:23.831
And I'm ready
to live with you.

01:31:27.007 --> 01:31:29.247
I'm not saying it
always be easy.

01:31:29.382 --> 01:31:31.040
I will make no sense ...

01:31:32.674 --> 01:31:36.040
staring to give people a oplawaai ...

01:31:37.632 --> 01:31:39.422
But one thing I understood.

01:31:40.341 --> 01:31:43.090
The others do not count.

01:31:43.716 --> 01:31:45.753
I decide.

01:31:46.757 --> 01:31:48.547
I love you.

01:31:48.674 --> 01:31:51.163
And the others should get used to it.

01:31:52.466 --> 01:31:53.561
I know that.

01:31:54.299 --> 01:31:55.840
I'm free.

01:31:56.632 --> 01:31:58.788
It took a while, but I'm free.

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.257
I love you, little man.

01:32:06.966 --> 01:32:08.293
Your neck will hurt.

01:32:08.882 --> 01:32:10.044
My back will hurt.

01:32:10.174 --> 01:32:12.709
We will dispense together.
It does not matter.
