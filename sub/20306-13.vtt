NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:08.258
This afternoon, we elect
our precinct P.B.A. representative.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.843
I am the patrolmen's candidate.

00:09.926 --> 00:11.761
Three Guys Disposal Company guarantees

00:11.845 --> 00:14.973
we're not only 40 percent cheaper,
we are 50 percent tougher.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.434
-I want us to cooperate.
-You want us to work for you.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.978
My name is Ted Rose.
I happen to be an orthodontist.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.480
It's strictly business,
but he's gonna do my teeth, too.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.024
Aren't you a little old for braces?

00:24.107 --> 00:27.861
The D.A. and I have been talking
about who would fill my slot.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.280
I have been authorized
to offer you the job.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.365
I have different contracts
out on me, Natalie.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.326
Department was hiding a witness
till he could give grand-jury testimony.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.745
-Killed?
-Kidnapped.

00:38.621 --> 00:43.460
-(overlapping conversations)
-Item six, your semiannual

00:43.918 --> 00:48.131
-117th Street junkie sweep.
-(all groaning)

00:48.214 --> 00:50.967
What Division wants, Division gets.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.555
Lieutenant Hunter directs this offensive
against the two heavily trafficked blocks

00:55.638 --> 00:58.266
-between Jefferson and Dekker.
-(man groaning)

00:58.349 --> 01:03.396
Bates, Coffey, Renko, Hill, Perez,
Atkinson, and Barber, you're on.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.024
Uh, seven. Now, most of you don't know,

01:06.107 --> 01:10.361
but we had a federal grand jury witness
here yesterday under protective custody.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.905
Was that, uh, Fisher, Sarge?

01:12.363 --> 01:15.075
Yeah. Now, two goons last night

01:15.158 --> 01:17.869
snatched him out of the lobby
of the Shepherd hotel,

01:17.952 --> 01:20.330
shot up one of the FBI guys
who was guarding him.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.124
We don't know whether they were trying
to spring Fisher

01:23.208 --> 01:25.585
or whether they were trying
to get to him before he testified.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.797
Whatever. Division has authorized an APB.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.175
Eight. Lieutenant Calletano
wants to let you know

01:32.425 --> 01:36.763
that as co-chairman of the department
committee on Hispanic promotion,

01:36.846 --> 01:41.059
he is completing a white paper
on the progress of Latinos

01:41.142 --> 01:43.728
to the rank of sergeant and above.

01:43.812 --> 01:48.233
All interested officers are requested
to submit comments.

01:48.483 --> 01:52.362
Uh, item nine. Uh, Detectives LaRue,
Washington, and Belker,

01:52.445 --> 01:55.198
they're continuing their investigation
of the illegal activities

01:55.281 --> 01:57.575
of the Intestinale Brothers'
Carting Company.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.869
I understand that we can add suspicion

01:59.953 --> 02:03.414
in the murder of restaurant owner
George Watkins to their parade of hits.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.918
Well, anyway, you guys know what's what.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.673
Uh, item ten.
Arson outbreak at the Hurtle project.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.051
Lieutenant Calletano
coordinates the investigation,

02:15.135 --> 02:16.845
um, with the fire marshal.

02:16.928 --> 02:22.392
Eleven. Today is the runoff
between patrolman Andrew Renko...

02:22.475 --> 02:25.603
(cheering, applauding)

02:25.687 --> 02:27.939
...and Lieutenant Howard Hunter...
-(groaning, cheering)

02:28.022 --> 02:30.441
-...for P.B.A. representative.
-(shushing)

02:30.525 --> 02:34.612
Now, um, try to cast your vote
before you go out.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.323
That way, maybe we can get an early count.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.534
Let's get this thing over with.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.287
Um, 12.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.207
Uh, this--this is a memo from the captain.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.587
"All officers, during arrest procedures,

02:50.670 --> 02:54.048
"take time to establish
suspect's primary language.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.927
"If called for, administer Miranda
in Spanish,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.637
"as printed on your warning cards.

02:59.721 --> 03:04.309
If uncertain, administer
in both English and Spanish."

03:07.395 --> 03:10.815
Related to this, uh, Eddie Santiago,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.067
who we lost his confession
to rape yesterday

03:13.151 --> 03:15.069
because of this bilingual mix-up,

03:15.528 --> 03:18.615
he tried to put the make
on our own Patsy Mayo.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.533
(jeering)

03:20.617 --> 03:22.202
-Hey!
-(man barks)

03:22.493 --> 03:25.205
In English, in English!

03:25.288 --> 03:29.209
And when she tried to go for the bust,
he pulled a piece.

03:29.292 --> 03:34.088
So in addition to he goes away,
to put it delicately,

03:34.505 --> 03:38.384
after Mayo returned fire,
it don't look like this creep

03:38.468 --> 03:41.679
is gonna have rape
in his arsenal anymore, either.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.015
(cheers, applause)

03:44.098 --> 03:46.184
-My partner! Right here!
-(whistling)

03:48.144 --> 03:52.857
Thataway, Detective,
which is a perfect demonstration

03:52.941 --> 03:54.734
of what I've been telling you all along,

03:54.817 --> 03:58.571
let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.907
(indistinct conversations)

04:01.908 --> 04:02.909
MAN: Way to go, Patsy.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.750
-Sarge?
-Yeah, Perez.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.377
Paletski's on a sick day.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.504
I was wondering if you can pull me off
that junkie sweep.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.423
-I'll take my regular patrol.
-Uh, no good, Mike.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.051
With your partner out,
I'm short-handed on the sweep already.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.511
You got a problem?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.638
No, uh, no problem.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.142
Uh, what did you mean by that, sergeant?

04:28.810 --> 04:29.686
By what's that, Patsy?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.730
That what I did demonstrates
what you've been saying?

04:33.189 --> 04:36.067
What I did was in policy.
I was reacting to a situation.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.152
What's the problem here?

04:38.736 --> 04:41.155
I'm not saying that you should take
the law into your own hands.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.534
Well, I-I don't like the way it sounded.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.036
In fact, I never like it
when you say that.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.707
Oh, hey, Detective,
it's an old cop saying.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.335
All it means is, uh, be on the lookout.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.629
Do your job before they do theirs.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.382
Well, that might be a nicer way to put it.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.594
Hey, how about "let's have a good shift"?

05:04.971 --> 05:08.558
How about "let's do our job
before they do theirs"? Okay?

05:09.892 --> 05:10.768
Okay.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.271
Okay.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.148
RENKO: Dennis, my friend,
remember when you vote today,

05:15.231 --> 05:17.483
a vote for me is a vote for you.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.945
I hate to be a stickler,
Andrew, but as a rule,

05:21.029 --> 05:25.199
electioneering in such proximity
to the voting place is frowned on.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.786
Mike, let's make the P.B.A. work
for all the cops on the beat.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.788
-What do you say, amigo?
-You got my vote, Andy.

05:30.872 --> 05:36.252
Captain, did you get authorization
on that wire for the Intestinale garage?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.712
I think Henry's supposed to get it
this morning.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.340
Good, 'cause Division
put the bug in last night.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.009
Frank!

05:44.177 --> 05:45.803
Frank, we have to talk.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.473
-Fay...
-Emergency, Frank.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.640
Fine.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.691
That's pretty fast work on the hardware.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.902
You don't know how fast, Frank.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.613
-Fay, if it's about the check--
-No, it is not about the check.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.864
Now, will you listen to me?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.992
I went to Dr. Rose's office last night.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.703
Uh, you know, it was after hours.
His nurse wasn't there.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.580
But, of course, he's doing me a favor.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.249
He gives me nitrous oxide,
he puts me in the chair,

06:15.625 --> 06:17.126
and while I was under,

06:18.086 --> 06:19.837
I believe he took advantage of me.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.214
In what way?

06:21.672 --> 06:25.051
In the way of unbuttoned buttons,
unclasped clasps.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.178
That's a serious allegation.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.722
Well, I have the evidence to back it up.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.141
See for yourself.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.730
What is that?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.484
-It's a hickey on my breast.
-Frank--

06:44.362 --> 06:46.739
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:48.574
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:48.658 --> 06:52.370
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:54.080
(sirens wailing)

06:59.544 --> 07:02.171
(theme music playing)

08:12.366 --> 08:15.495
FRANK: Check number 1478,
Dr. Theodore Rose, right.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.538
Stop payment. Mm-hmm. You're kidding me?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.290
All right, I'll get in as soon as I can.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.126
Six dollar fee is fine, yeah. Thanks.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.879
I spoke to Sweeney in Midtown.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.756
They can't move on Dr. Rose now.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.508
He asked if we could take it alone.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.761
All right, get a deposition from Fay
and start a search warrant.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.845
All right.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.222
Patsy...

08:37.850 --> 08:40.019
-Could I see your teeth?
-What?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.103
Smile for me.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.066
-Slight overlap. Good.
-Good?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.236
See Lieutenant Calletano
about an out-of-precinct undercover.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.072
-Okay.
-RENKO: You swing your people my way,

08:51.155 --> 08:52.323
-Lieutenant, patrolman--
-Andy...

08:53.199 --> 08:55.326
I already had a conversation
about this with Howard.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.953
You mean you already
made other arrangements?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.455
-No.
-Henry, no last-minute

08:59.539 --> 09:01.332
proletariat sentimentality surfacing.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.000
How can I be more clear about this?

09:03.084 --> 09:04.794
I am neutral. That's it.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.837
I don't know
what you're so worked up about.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.422
I only got nine votes.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.467
Frank, Irwin Bernstein
just had this messengered over.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.303
FBI wants any help we can give
on the Jimmy Fisher kidnapping.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.307
-What is it?
-A list of people Fisher was gonna name

09:18.391 --> 09:19.559
before the grand jury.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.769
They wanna know
if there are any familiar faces.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.022
Salvatore and Joseph Intestinale.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.243
-You left the garbage where?
-MAN: You wanna make this run here...

09:37.326 --> 09:38.286
In the street?

09:39.787 --> 09:40.830
Address, Earl.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.625
-What's the problem?
-No problem.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.460
Just pay attention
to what's in front of you, Mike.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.755
Yeah, yeah.
That's why you're second string, pal.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
Yeah.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.510
JOEY: If you could think,
you wouldn't be doing what you're doing.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.556
That clears that up.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.766
Vinnie was called out of town yesterday.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.603
At the last minute, he subcontracts
to this mutt Earl from Detroit,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.730
and this mutt leaves the garbage
right in the street.

10:05.813 --> 10:06.731
Can you believe that?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.691
Well, he ain't gonna pick it up.
You get a location?

10:08.899 --> 10:11.110
Yeah, dumpster, broad daylight, the moron.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.821
Joey, just shut up. (chuckles)

10:14.071 --> 10:17.199
Our line of work, all people see
is what we don't do, right?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.826
-Right.
-(laughs)

10:18.909 --> 10:20.953
Missing a collection, though,
gets me right here.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.664
Hey, you want to make
yourself useful, all right?

10:24.457 --> 10:28.586
You pick up the dumpster here, all right,
and take it over to our dump right here.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.713
Shouldn't they take it straight
to the processing plant?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.715
Yeah, we could do that if it's better.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.800
No, what's better is what I say.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.387
Now, when Joey gets his own business,
then he can take it straight to the plant.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.723
-Sal!
-Shut up, Joey!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.770
Three guys... (chuckle)
you're out of here.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.104
LARUE: What are we supposed
to be looking for?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.105
WASHINGTON: I don't know.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.524
That conversation seemed a little hinky,
don't you think?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.818
Hey, those guys are hinky, period.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.613
Hey, Mick, hold it!

10:56.822 --> 10:57.865
(body thumps)

10:59.158 --> 11:01.243
-Did you see what I think I saw?
-Yeah.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.830
Jimmy Fisher, Captain,
shot about six times.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.582
You recover a weapon?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.543
Uh... no. We didn't find one.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.631
There's a lot of garbage to sift through.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.801
-What do you want us to do now?
-I'm gonna call the coroner's office,

11:16.884 --> 11:17.968
see if we can get someone out there

11:18.052 --> 11:20.096
to examine the body
and issue a certificate.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.891
If they'll cooperate,
you go ahead and deliver the load,

11:23.974 --> 11:25.601
then we'll set up a stakeout at the dump.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.688
Right.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.068
HUNTER (on megaphone):
Sons and daughters of Morpheus,

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
-forsake your sleep of walking dreams.
-(siren wailing)

11:37.530 --> 11:41.617
Trust and find peace
in the arms of the law.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.995
Learn to manufacture your own endorphins.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.708
They're more economical,
and they're good for you, too.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.000
All right, close it up.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.256
Let's go.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.133
No concert today.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.803
Crackerjack work, officers.
First-rate performance.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.764
Everybody gets an "A"
in my fields report today.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.768
Hey, if somebody trying to buy votes
with false praise.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.771
-He must think you two are real stupid.
-Hey, Renko. Renko, let's go!

12:13.607 --> 12:16.193
(siren wailing)

12:28.330 --> 12:31.584
-(coughs)
-(indistinct shouting)

12:39.341 --> 12:42.344
(screaming in Spanish)

12:42.428 --> 12:45.181
No! You gotta stay calm.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.725
(shouting)

12:47.808 --> 12:50.186
(sirens wailing)

12:53.898 --> 12:57.067
-RENKO: Mike!
-Here, Andy.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.403
-(coughs)
-RENKO: Mike, where are you, man?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.614
-(shouting indistinctly)
-MIKE: This is the last one.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.158
It's all right. Go, go, go!

13:06.076 --> 13:06.952
Mike!

13:09.705 --> 13:11.874
-Mike, is he okay?
-This here's the last one.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.209
Anybody else up in there?

13:13.584 --> 13:17.797
-That's it. Oh my god.
-That's all. (coughing)

13:17.880 --> 13:20.925
You got 'em all out.
You got 'em all out, bud.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.178
You're a hero, bud. You're a hero, bud.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.972
(indistinct chatter)

13:28.724 --> 13:30.601
So, Pats, this is our anniversary.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.770
What anniversary?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.898
A month ago today, I was Harry the Hump.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.274
You were gonna get a new partner.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.901
Don't sweat it.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.363
So everything's good with us?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.740
Mm-hmm. Everything's fine.

13:46.075 --> 13:46.992
What are you doing?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.119
Everything's fine.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.581
-What?
-You're going like this.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.876
Look, I can't believe they picked me
for this dentist undercover.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.294
There's nothing wrong with my teeth.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.130
Pats, they picked you
because the dentist doesn't grope guys.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.132
-See these two teeth, they overlap.
-Where?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.884
You think I should get these
straightened out, see?

14:04.134 --> 14:05.803
(chuckles) Nobody notices that.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.431
Maybe the captain's trying
to say something.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.475
What is this, Patsy,
a little sweet on the captain?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.936
-What's that mean?
-(chuckles) Sorry. None of my business.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.105
Listen, jerk, "A," you're damn right
it's none of your business,

14:16.188 --> 14:18.899
my personal life,
and "B", the answer's "no." N-O.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.402
Well, good, because "C",
I think you're perfect.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.945
Your teeth don't need braces.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.492
-Harry...
-(man talking indistinctly)

14:34.707 --> 14:40.588
-HARRY: Commercial plate, XEI397.
-(camera shutter clicking)

14:41.046 --> 14:45.801
Uh, it looks like we're talking
one white male over six feet, dark jacket.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.638
The dump guy's around,
I don't know, maybe 6'4".

14:49.722 --> 14:52.892
He's a white male, mid-30s, plaid jacket.

14:52.975 --> 14:57.313
Here's a driver. It's also a white male,
six feet, maybe more, dark jacket.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.149
-(camera shutter clicking)
-Okay, we got 'em.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.528
-Here he is.
-All right, my man. (laughs)

15:04.612 --> 15:07.907
-Oh, Mike, that was terrific. Fabulous.
-Mike.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.408
Congratulations, Mike.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.702
Hey, Perez, way to go, man. That's great.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.121
(speaking Spanish)

15:14.204 --> 15:16.832
-Nice work.
-Thank you, Captain.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.751
I got to go call my wife.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.795
Where's my boy? Where's<i> Señor </i>Perez?

15:21.879 --> 15:23.672
He went to make a phone call, Chief,
I'll get him.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
-Good.
-STAN: Hey, Perez. Chief is here.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.301
You don't mind if I borrow your foyer here

15:27.384 --> 15:30.804
for a little impromptu announcement
on a Sinclair for Mike Perez, huh?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.307
It just happened, Chief.
We'd like to do the paperwork.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.934
Maybe hold off on an announcement.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.061
Well, damn it, Ray, let's get paperwork.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.022
The first Hispanic to earn
this department's highest medal.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.983
-Let's get behind our boy here.
-Right away, Chief.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.443
(reporters clamoring)

15:44.526 --> 15:45.611
Officer Perez.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.697
-Good. Let's take--
-No, it's that guy right there.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.240
-What's that? Oh.
-Right here.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.743
-Glad to meet you, Chief.
-Officer Perez.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.330
-Uh, this okay, fellas?
-(overlapping dialog)

15:56.872 --> 16:00.876
FLETCHER: Oh, and here we have
the citizens he saved.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.711
Right here.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.880
-(camera shutters clicking)
-A year and a half ago,

16:05.589 --> 16:07.549
this tough street cop by my side

16:07.633 --> 16:10.094
was involved in a tragic shooting
of a young child.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.056
In its aftermath, he endured
the tortures of the damned.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.058
But because on that day,

16:16.141 --> 16:18.394
an enlightened police department
stood by him,

16:19.144 --> 16:21.230
Officer Perez was on duty this morning

16:21.313 --> 16:24.608
to pull four people
from a blazing, smoky inferno.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.944
I am deeply proud to announce

16:27.194 --> 16:30.489
that officer Mike Perez will receive
this department's highest honor,

16:30.990 --> 16:35.494
the Sinclair medal for personal valor
above and beyond the call of duty.

16:35.577 --> 16:39.665
-(applauding)
-(indistinct dialog)

16:43.043 --> 16:45.504
-Do you have the reports on Mike Perez?
-Yeah, right here.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.172
Give us another ten minutes, Lieutenant.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.717
All right, as long as the chief gets them
before he leaves, huh?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.345
You got writer's cramp there, pal?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.514
Just trying to get it
down straight, Renko.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.435
I didn't see Perez
at the junkie sweep, did you?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.312
I did not, 'cause he was over at the fire.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.107
Yeah, but the fire call came
after the sweep.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.942
It was in our sector, not his.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.028
The report does not ask you
to speculate, Robert,

17:09.111 --> 17:12.614
whether the man might previously have been
on an unauthorized coffee break.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.284
The man saved four lives.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.079
It's a bird, it's a plane,

17:19.163 --> 17:21.999
it's Fletcher Daniels
climbing on a bandwagon.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.960
Do you know that for weeks
he's been trying to diffuse

17:25.044 --> 17:28.547
a departmental committee
on Hispanic underrepresentation?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.217
Along comes Mike Perez, hero of the hour.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.428
I'm happy for him, though.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.846
Yeah, me too.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.139
Boy, you look great.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.642
I'm meeting Irwin Bernstein
at the Beau Rivage.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.144
Any inclinations?

17:42.227 --> 17:44.605
I'm not sure I've got a clear enough
picture to know yet.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.149
-You got my vote.
-Which way?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.194
-Whatever you decide.
-Thanks, pizza man.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.405
Now, just tell me about your junkie sweep.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.785
You guys, uh, pull a decent arrest
in the lot?

17:57.868 --> 17:58.744
I doubt it.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.246
Captain, we got a junkie real itchy
to get back on the street.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.915
He says he can give us
this morning's arsonist.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.625
Good. Get him into interrogation.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.960
-Ray...
-Yes?

18:07.628 --> 18:10.798
Yeah, Mike, look, when I assign you
to a junkie sweep,

18:10.881 --> 18:12.758
it's 'cause I want you on a junkie sweep.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.801
I was on my way.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.136
Then I saw some suspicious
activity in the building.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.429
So you countermanded my order.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.181
You end up pulling three kids
out of a blaze.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.726
I ought to yell at you,
but I guess I'll shake your hand.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.146
-And, hey, don't make it no practice.
-MAN: Congratulations.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.231
You got it, Sarge.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.650
You know, we had a Sinclair
winner last year

18:29.733 --> 18:31.401
back at Polk Avenue, Billy Brock.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.196
Got his hand blown off diffusing a bomb.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.741
-Tough kid.
-Hey, Sinclair award for bravery,

18:37.825 --> 18:39.159
above and beyond.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.245
Son of a gun, Miguel Perez.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.331
-Doesn't sound too bad, huh?
-Thanks, Sarge.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.670
Are we talking only about today?

18:50.462 --> 18:53.006
All I know is this morning. (panting)

18:53.590 --> 18:55.717
Come on, man,
when am I gonna get out of here?

18:56.176 --> 18:59.471
You'll be out of here as soon
as we can verify the information.

19:00.347 --> 19:03.225
Man, I don't get out of here,
they'll be gone with my stash.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.434
I got to move!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.395
His name and address.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.856
I give it to you, you'll let me go?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.357
When we make the arrest.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.237
-Cooperate or go back downstairs.
-(sobbing)

19:15.737 --> 19:18.115
Willie Goins.

19:20.492 --> 19:24.121
117th and Dekker.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.624
He's above the Chinese laundry, man.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.882
Coffey, Bates...

19:35.716 --> 19:36.758
arson suspect.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.556
-Uh, Mike, you have a second?
-Sure.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.767
I just want to let you know
I think it's a wonderful award,

19:46.101 --> 19:47.603
and there's no one I'd rather see get it.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.898
I didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't
have done under the circumstances.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.317
Give yourself some credit.
You had a rough year.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.569
-Thanks, Lieutenant.
-Frank, Mick Belker wants to know

19:55.652 --> 19:58.572
can we expedite authorization
on bugging the Intestinale garage.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.866
I have a call in.
Tell him we're moving as fast as we can.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.910
-Nice work, Mike.
-Thanks.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.332
I don't usually have wine with lunch.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.917
I'm just trying to soften you up.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.753
-Irwin, you flirt.
-(chuckling) No.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.713
uh, Bernstein's rule number one,

20:15.130 --> 20:17.341
never flirt with a woman
whose husband carries a gun.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.845
Have you given the offer any more thought?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.556
I'm worried about how much
independence I'd have,

20:24.640 --> 20:25.807
how much discretion.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.643
I'm just trying to get a better picture.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.686
Suppose I get an innocent guy.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.231
-Your three out of 100?
-Your three, your six.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.692
Suppose I know the guy is innocent,
but I've got him anyway.

20:35.984 --> 20:36.985
What happens then?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.029
What happens? You dismiss.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.076
I wouldn't have to go through channels?

20:45.702 --> 20:48.455
Persuade some gung-ho
throw-away-the-key types?

20:48.705 --> 20:51.917
Worst possible case,
if the D.A. totally disagreed with you,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.502
he'd pass the file to somebody else.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.711
What about plea bargaining?

20:54.795 --> 20:56.630
What if I need to go
outside the guidelines?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.424
You go to your superior,
who happens to be me,

20:59.508 --> 21:01.802
your classic old softie,
who would tell you,

21:01.885 --> 21:02.886
"Do what you think is right."

21:03.553 --> 21:04.554
And if it's not you?

21:05.597 --> 21:06.473
I don't know what you've heard,

21:06.556 --> 21:09.268
but there are good lawyers
working out of that office.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.936
I don't think you'd have any trouble.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.398
What I'm trying to say is
we wanna make it work.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.278
I'm grateful for everything
you're doing here, Irwin--

21:19.361 --> 21:22.030
Maybe the way to look at it is
the D.A.'s office needs you.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.200
I know the P.D.'s office needs you, too,
but if the system works,

21:25.534 --> 21:27.828
it's because the best people
are making it work on both sides.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.665
We need passion like yours,
your intelligence, your integrity.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.627
I don't think I can spell it out
any clearer than that.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.843
Asking all the ways
I can get innocent guys off,

21:42.926 --> 21:45.137
-I'm still reacting like a P.D.
-Still?

21:46.513 --> 21:47.639
You mentioned 44,000?

21:47.723 --> 21:50.559
We're talking 44,000,
we're talking annual salary review.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.311
-We're talking political stepping stone.
-When would you want me?

21:52.394 --> 21:54.396
-Yesterday. What do you say?
-You've got a deal.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.440
-Mm-hmm.
-(both laughing)

21:57.482 --> 22:01.570
Captain, we got Willie Goins upstairs,
the junkie who set that fire.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.696
I think you should hear this.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.867
Don't find fire on Willie Goins' sheet.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.619
"B" and "E," "B" and "E."

22:09.953 --> 22:11.246
"B" and "E" is my shtick.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.165
RAY: Just tell the captain your story.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.418
I do business with one of your cops.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.254
I may do business in an information way.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.674
Your Mike Perez's snitch.
I authorize the money.

22:25.802 --> 22:29.681
I wasn't aware you were aware
of the arrangement.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.642
-What's going on?
-He says Mike Perez booked the fire.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.106
-What?
-He did. He told me to set it.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.483
When did he tell you that?

22:40.650 --> 22:43.153
Last night, he come by my crib.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.698
-FRANK: How much did he pay you?
-Sixty bucks.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.741
Where did you set it?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.078
Right down on the basement step.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.788
Dumped gasoline down there.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.083
You willing to take a lie-detector test?

22:56.166 --> 22:57.959
(scoffs) Whatever you want.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.922
Arson and flame is not
Willie Goin's operation.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.298
FRANK: Get him to garden level.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.509
MAN: Would you come with me, please?

23:10.472 --> 23:11.640
-(door closes)
-Where's Perez?

23:12.015 --> 23:13.100
He went to lunch.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.352
All right, set up the polygraph.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.979
Let's talk to the people he rescued
and the other cops who saw it.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.358
-I do not want to believe this.
-Neither do I.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.286
HARRY: We got real nice stuff, Captain.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.122
You're gonna be pleased.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.624
Right, and it's all on film.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.794
Uh-huh.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.172
Yeah, I think it was the cousin
that picked up the body, Captain.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.174
Paul Intestinale.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.262
Yeah, he came
with that moron goon, uh, Carl.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.723
All right, they came about an hour
after our guys dropped it off

23:53.807 --> 23:58.687
and went directly to the funeral home
at 4269 Hudson.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.730
All right, frequent contact, Harry.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.859
Listen, has Mayo left
for Dr. Rose's office yet?

24:05.026 --> 24:05.861
Yeah.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.488
Okay, good, good. All right.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.493
I did it.

24:14.494 --> 24:17.372
-What?
-I took it, the prosecutor's job.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.500
-Congratulations.
-(laughs) Thanks.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.087
-What?
-You look as if you're about to jump

24:24.171 --> 24:25.922
-over a fence.
-(laughs)

24:26.006 --> 24:28.258
-When do you start?
-Monday.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.510
-Really? That soon?
-Mm.

24:31.261 --> 24:34.598
Irwin has to start then as bureau chief,
and there are cases in process.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.684
I don't mind jumping in.
Get to find out what it's like.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.145
-You're excited.
-I'm something.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.605
Oh, excuse me, Frank.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.357
Uh, we got Willie Goins'
polygraph results.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.651
-Sorry.
-(indistinct) Lieutenant.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.573
Goins passed every question.
He's telling the truth.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.116
No ambiguities?

24:53.200 --> 24:55.827
Captain, that's Mrs. Suarez
right behind me.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.246
She's seen Perez a number of times

24:58.330 --> 25:00.081
in the last couple weeks
at the tenement house.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.167
In fact, he knocked on her door,
even talked to her two or three times.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.211
He was there this morning
before the alarms went out.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.462
Uh, Mike...

25:07.380 --> 25:08.632
Could I talk to you for a minute?

25:17.641 --> 25:18.600
Is there a problem, Lieutenant?

25:20.268 --> 25:21.144
(door closes)

25:21.937 --> 25:24.064
We arrested Willie Goins on a tip, Mike.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.359
Jeez, uh, do you think
we can kick the bust, Captain?

25:27.442 --> 25:28.276
He's my snitch.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.238
He says you hired him
to set fire to that building

25:31.321 --> 25:33.156
where you rescued the Suarez family.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.535
(chuckles) Are you kidding?

25:36.743 --> 25:37.911
You don't believe that.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.413
He says you paid him 60 dollars
and offered him a ride--

25:40.497 --> 25:43.041
-This is sick!
-He just passed the polygraph.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.085
Of course he's gonna pass a polygraph.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.753
The guy's as schizzy as hell.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.922
I-I told you when I brought it
to you, Captain.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.715
When I asked if can turn Goins,

25:50.924 --> 25:52.717
I told you where I met him
and everything else.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.470
I met him when I was under treatment,
Lieutenant.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.140
I told the captain that Goins is a junkie
and he's half nuts,

25:59.224 --> 26:01.142
but that he's connected
with some heavy "B" and "E" guys.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.353
We don't think Goins is lying about this.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.273
We think you set up that rescue.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.025
Oh, you know, this is great!

26:09.901 --> 26:11.695
(sighs) This is terrific.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.824
A psycho stool pigeon
looks to get well, giving me up,

26:16.575 --> 26:18.285
and my own people buy his story.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.745
Thanks for the loyalty!
Thanks for believing in me!

26:21.246 --> 26:23.331
It isn't just his testimony, Miguel.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.000
You left your assignment.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.836
You got to the fire
before it was called in.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.505
Mrs. Suarez says
you were hanging around the building.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.464
You even talked to her.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.258
So?

26:33.758 --> 26:34.843
So, I was looking for a guy

26:34.926 --> 26:37.095
who was taking copper pipes
out of condemned buildings.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.722
FRANK: That's not what Mrs. Suarez says.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.601
Look, Mike, we know you've had a year
of terrible pressure.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.144
Nobody's sitting in judgment here.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.729
But if you don't come forward quickly,

26:45.812 --> 26:47.856
we're gonna lose the opportunity
to deal with this

26:47.939 --> 26:49.608
on any kind of sympathetic level.

26:50.984 --> 26:55.113
I mean, you're facing headlines,
indictment, jail.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.741
I'm not coming forward...

26:58.825 --> 27:00.285
'cause I didn't do anything wrong.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.496
-Miguel, please.
-Sure, you side with the lieutenant.

27:03.580 --> 27:07.834
-You give up one of your own.
-(speaking Spanish)

27:08.668 --> 27:11.129
We're doing everything we can
to exonerate you, Mike.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.380
We're looking into everything.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.760
But you better get yourself a lawyer.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.648
Chief, there's no question in my mind
that Perez is lying.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.734
I know it's an embarrassment.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.320
Maybe if you hadn't been so quick
to canonize him...

27:38.198 --> 27:39.407
Of course we're investigating.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.118
No, we're not.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.081
He-He tried to commit suicide
18 months ago.

27:49.959 --> 27:50.794
Yeah.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.254
Okay, I will.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.465
(receiver hangs up)

27:59.094 --> 28:00.804
It's all gonna blow up in his face, Ray.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.349
I'd be more sympathetic
if he had the guts to come forward.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.104
Piece of junk!

28:10.021 --> 28:12.273
<i>Oficial, muchas gracias.</i>

28:16.986 --> 28:17.946
Come on. (sighs)

28:22.033 --> 28:23.576
-Okay.
-(machine whirring)

28:23.660 --> 28:25.328
Now, keep your mouth closed, please.

28:28.873 --> 28:29.749
Mm-hmm.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.380
Okay. Open, please.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.509
Well, Patsy, you have some
reclusive crowding in the mandible.

28:39.592 --> 28:43.304
It's causing a minor dislocation
of the cuspid.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.558
-Oh. (chuckles)
-Okay, you can close.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.604
-Okay, coming up here.
-So, what's the verdict?

28:51.688 --> 28:54.649
(chuckles)
It's all very strictly cosmetic,

28:54.733 --> 28:57.068
and I could charge you an arm
and a very pretty leg.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.528
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.530
That would involve bands, separators.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.823
That's the "A" way to go.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.576
It's very costly
and, uh, it takes a lot of time.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.286
As opposed to the "B" way?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.330
(clicks tongue) Well, the "b" way,
excuse me,

29:09.956 --> 29:12.250
is that you come in early one morning.

29:12.959 --> 29:17.046
I refile, recontour the cuspid,
adjust the bite, and you're done.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.549
-Is it painful?
-No, not at all.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.968
I give you some goofy gas,
you won't feel a thing.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.889
Oh. How soon do you think we can do this?

29:27.265 --> 29:28.767
Well, if you want it, as I remember,

29:28.850 --> 29:30.852
we have an eight o' clock cancellation
tomorrow morning.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.395
-How would that be?
-Okay.

29:33.646 --> 29:34.481
I know it's silly.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.942
I've always had this thing about smiling
because of my teeth.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.654
You're a very beautiful woman, Patsy.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.616
We'll make sure you have
a very beautiful smile, okay?

29:44.699 --> 29:47.952
-(chuckles) Thank you, Dr. Rose.
-That's all right.

29:49.329 --> 29:53.666
MAN: Yeah, throw it up. Come on.
That's it. Right this way. Let's go.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.507
-Salvetti?
-Yeah, he's got that guy Earl with him.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.467
I gotta use the john.

30:02.675 --> 30:03.760
Long run, Mike.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.470
-Hey.
-(laughs)

30:05.553 --> 30:07.680
Maybe that restaurant guy
don't like our prices.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.099
-Maybe he put something in the food.
-I'll tell you something.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.185
We're gonna have to go back
and do a follow-up on that guy.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.687
'Cause when they're all scared like that
with the tears and everything,

30:14.979 --> 30:16.898
the next day, that's when they look
to back out on you.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.411
See, this is beautiful here.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.248
The guy wants 100 percent plus a bonus,

30:33.331 --> 30:35.333
for which he leaves
the delivery in an alley!

30:35.416 --> 30:40.088
This is what I was told, Mr. Intestinale,
8,000 bonus if I got to him by today.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.756
(speaks foreign language)

30:41.840 --> 30:43.842
He blows an assignment,
and he wants a bonus.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.427
I don't think it's right
not to get the bonus.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.720
He don't think it's right.

30:47.804 --> 30:51.057
He comes in to do an assignment,
and he leaves the package in the street!

30:51.140 --> 30:53.268
Mr. Intestinale, it was dark.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.561
I thought I was being followed.

30:54.644 --> 30:57.397
Usual procedure is to take evasive action.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.650
See, I said you had to hear this.
This is who I'm trying to make sense to.

31:01.484 --> 31:04.320
Kid, you were supposed
to deliver the package

31:04.404 --> 31:05.280
to the funeral home.

31:06.489 --> 31:10.118
If the package don't get proper disposal,
then we haven't done our job right.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.037
And this family's got a reputation
for 22 years!

31:13.580 --> 31:16.040
Mr. Intestinale, I am a professional.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.251
I followed professional procedure.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.545
Now I gotta fall down and die!

31:20.753 --> 31:23.506
I mean, this guy's gonna give me a stroke.
I could bust my veins out!

31:23.923 --> 31:25.091
Four thousand dollars.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.427
That's not what was discussed.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.846
Absolutely correct.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.016
Now, you tell our friend back in Detroit

31:33.683 --> 31:35.810
we're not satisfied
with who he sent to us.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.188
You tell him we think
40 percent is more than fair.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.524
And if he's got any questions about it,

31:41.816 --> 31:43.276
He's to call me personally.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.277
Understand?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.154
You got that?

31:47.864 --> 31:48.865
Now, get out of here.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.035
-Get on back to Detroit.
-You need a map?

31:52.118 --> 31:52.994
We got a monkey map.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.787
You're going back in the trees,
you baboon brain!

31:54.871 --> 31:57.916
No, I don't think
that crackin' wise helps anything.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.877
-I'm sorry.
-(indistinct chattering)

32:00.960 --> 32:02.629
I know I didn't do an A-plus job.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.255
Maybe I'll get to work for you again.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.932
(toilet flushes)

32:19.520 --> 32:20.939
MAN: Yeah, get out of here, will you?

32:22.023 --> 32:25.151
Hey, uh, what do you got, the runs?

32:25.485 --> 32:27.195
-You got the trots?
-(car engine starts)

32:27.278 --> 32:29.864
Yeah. (coughs) I really don't feel well.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.575
-(tires screech)
-I'm gonna call my doctor.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.452
(tires screech)

32:48.591 --> 32:50.510
You know all the trouble that I was having
writing up that report.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.552
-All I'm saying--
- The stuff just wasn't

32:51.636 --> 32:52.512
adding up from the start.

32:52.595 --> 32:56.641
All I'm saying, Chief Daniels and all,
come to their conclusions mighty quick.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.017
-Maybe before jumping the gun...
-He had to.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.143
we ought to wait on a few more facts.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.146
You two--Hey, look, I'm not trying
to crucify the guy.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.398
Will you listening to what Bates
was saying?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.775
-About that Mrs. Suarez?
-Suarez. Yeah, right.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.193
-Heck, yeah, I did. It made me sick.

Out of the car!

(indistinct conversations)

34:27.190 --> 34:29.317
-Hey, do I get a phone call?
-Yeah, you get one.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.568
Could it be long distance?

34:31.110 --> 34:33.321
I'd like to discuss facts
here a second, Earl.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.656
We have you for kidnapping,

34:36.574 --> 34:39.410
positive I.D. from the detectives
at the hotel last night.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.289
We have you for murder.
We found Jimmy Fisher's body.

34:43.873 --> 34:44.874
You found the body.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.751
Right in the dumpster where you left it.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.088
And the caliber matched
to the gun we got from your car.

34:50.171 --> 34:53.508
(sighs) You got such a great case.
What do you need me for?

34:53.758 --> 34:56.385
Well, if you agree to testify
against the Intestinales,

34:56.469 --> 34:57.970
we could cut some kind of deal.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.890
Earl, think.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.309
If we arrest the Intestinales,

35:03.392 --> 35:05.311
they're gonna roll over on you
like a rock.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.729
Do you think they won't?

35:06.896 --> 35:08.314
I didn't even get paid my full figure.

35:08.397 --> 35:11.109
Can you believe that?
The nerve of those creeps.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.111
If this was Detroit,
I wouldn't even be here.

35:13.194 --> 35:16.030
This place would be knee deep in lawyers,
and I'd be home watching the ballgame.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.742
Those slobs! Those slob garbage men.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.247
Let me tell you. I wouldn't ordinarily do
business with people like that

35:24.330 --> 35:26.666
because frankly,
they insult my intelligence.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.251
Do you wanna wait for your lawyer, Earl?

35:28.334 --> 35:30.545
Some out-of-town suit who don't know me?
No, thank you.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.171
Earl Schuster knows the law.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.591
And, by the way, uh, would, um,

35:36.551 --> 35:38.761
4,000 cash do anything for you gentlemen,

35:39.137 --> 35:42.181
by way of getting me out of this thing,
you know, quietly?

35:45.726 --> 35:47.687
I'm just gonna let that go by, Earl.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.063
Okay, okay, forget I mentioned it.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.440
What kind of time are we talking about?

35:51.524 --> 35:52.567
Five to seven years, depending

35:52.650 --> 35:54.443
-on the judge and probation.
-Five to seven?

35:54.527 --> 35:55.903
You killed a guy, Earl!

35:55.987 --> 35:59.115
Hey, give me a break, for crying out loud.
I hardly didn't even get paid.

36:01.534 --> 36:05.288
If you refuse to cooperate,
the alternative is 12 years minimum.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.584
Earl Schuster does a job,

36:09.667 --> 36:13.462
he expects to get paid
in cash full as discussed!

36:14.297 --> 36:16.090
I'm a professional.
I shouldn't even be here.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.550
I do these guys a favor,

36:17.633 --> 36:19.677
I come down here at the last minute
and they try to stiff me.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.598
Let me tell you, that is bad business.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.391
Nobody stiffs Earl Schuster.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.313
(sighs)

36:31.898 --> 36:33.441
Okay, what do you need?

36:33.900 --> 36:34.901
Just keep talking.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.112
-Take his statement, Henry.
-(Earl sighs)

36:39.322 --> 36:40.489
(door opens)

36:42.450 --> 36:45.703
Ray, let's go for warrants
on the Intestinales, suspicion murder,

36:45.786 --> 36:47.413
and let's get a search warrant
for the mortuary.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.623
We have to have that body.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.000
-Well?
-He seems like an okay guy.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.710
You haven't been with him
while you're unconscious.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.962
I will be tomorrow.
He's giving me the gas.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.841
Sarge, about my Midtown operation,
any luck with the 1,000-millimeter lens?

36:58.925 --> 37:00.593
Ah, division's giving me the runaround.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.304
Hill is looking into maybe his girlfriend
getting one for us.

37:05.306 --> 37:08.017
Oh, Perez, a couple
of phone messages for you.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.144
That-that woman
from the channel eight news.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.732
Hold it! Police officers.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.275
-All right, step back.
-Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.194
We've got a warrant here
to search the casket.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.570
-Ma'am, ma'am, please.
-You leave my Sidney alone!

37:19.654 --> 37:21.781
-Ma'am, please.
-Don't-- Don't touch the--

37:21.864 --> 37:24.075
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am, please!

37:24.492 --> 37:27.745
Now, I happen to know that this
is a very sorrowful time for you.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.539
But we have reason to believe
that this is not your Sidney.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.166
-Well, of course, it's my Sidney.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.210
-Who else could it be?
-You're going to have to just step back!

37:34.293 --> 37:38.422
-BOBBY: Please.
-(crying) My Sidney! Oh, you pigs!

37:38.506 --> 37:41.050
You monsters!

37:41.133 --> 37:43.594
-Mr. Baldisseri...
-Flip it! Flip it over!

37:43.678 --> 37:44.512
-Release the pins!
-What?

37:44.595 --> 37:46.264
-Push it back. Push it back.
-WOMAN: What are you doing? What?

37:46.347 --> 37:47.807
-Okay, turn it this way.
-Oh!

37:47.890 --> 37:50.101
-Careful. Careful you don't knock him out.
-(WOMAN SHOUTING)

37:50.184 --> 37:51.978
-There we go. There we go.
-WOMAN: Oh!

37:52.603 --> 37:53.771
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.524
-(grunts)
-(body thuds)

38:00.778 --> 38:01.904
Mr. Fisher, I presume.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.075
(sirens wail)

38:13.582 --> 38:16.294
-(talking indistinctly)
-HUNTER (on megaphone): Police!

38:16.669 --> 38:22.341
Intestinale and associates,
this is the police...

38:22.883 --> 38:25.594
-Freeze!
-Put your hands on your head!

38:26.137 --> 38:28.264
-BELKER: What is this?
-You're busted, Sal.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.849
SAL: You're cops? You're kidding me!

38:30.766 --> 38:31.684
Hey, get out of here.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.229
-This is disgusting!
-Shut up! You're under arrest!

38:35.938 --> 38:39.317
Hey! You're dead meat, dude!
You can't do this to me.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.152
You ain't got nothin' on me!
You understand?

38:41.235 --> 38:42.945
Move, garbage dump!

38:43.029 --> 38:46.240
-(indistinct conversations)
-(telephone ringing)

38:47.658 --> 38:49.327
You'll get it next year, Lieutenant.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.164
Congratulations, Andrew.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.290
-I won?
-Hey, you won, Andy!

38:54.373 --> 38:56.584
-I want to say good luck...
-That's fantastic.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.544
-Hey, Renko won!
-Hey, way to go!

38:58.627 --> 39:00.546
-(cheering)
-Representative Andrew Renko.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.798
You seem to have inspired
the sort of confidence

39:02.882 --> 39:04.759
-that this position requires.
-Congratulations, Andrew.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.177
Say, Andy, you gonna call Daryl Ann?

39:06.260 --> 39:07.928
-In a minute. In a minute.
-All right.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.222
-I just...
-So, Andy, the people speak, huh?

39:10.306 --> 39:12.266
I wanna wish you nothing
but the best, Andrew.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.393
Ain't this something?
Ain't this something?

39:14.477 --> 39:17.980
-(laughing)
-(indistinct conversations)

39:18.064 --> 39:20.858
Mistake, mistake, mistake.

39:20.941 --> 39:24.278
(chuckling) You spank my monkey!
Ain't that something?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.864
Andrew J. Renko elected to office.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.532
I'll tell you what, little girl.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.534
You get a bottle of "bo-jolly,"
and I'm gonna come home.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.454
We're gonna celebrate
all night long. Bye-bye.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.500
Hey, there, bud!

39:38.667 --> 39:39.585
How's it going?

39:40.211 --> 39:43.047
-Hear about my election?
-Yeah, I just overheard.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.971
Look, Mike, um, maybe if you want
to talk to somebody about this...

39:51.764 --> 39:52.681
What did you hear, huh?

39:53.891 --> 39:56.143
Did you hear about that railroad job
that they're pulling on me?

39:57.269 --> 39:59.355
I heard some stuff.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.482
-Yeah, I heard some rumors.
-(sighs)

40:05.277 --> 40:10.241
You know, maybe, uh,
we ought to go down to the union

40:10.324 --> 40:13.119
and try to find some name of a lawyer
you could talk to.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.120
Why is that?

40:14.954 --> 40:16.455
'Cause you think
I set some family on fire?

40:16.539 --> 40:18.833
Oh, no, I just think,
under the circumstances,

40:18.916 --> 40:20.793
you get the best kind of advice possible.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.087
Yeah, but who do you believe, Renko?

40:23.170 --> 40:25.339
I mean, do you believe me
or some damn street snitch?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.883
-I wasn't there, Mike.
-You saw me!

40:28.217 --> 40:30.386
-Yeah, I saw you, but I saw you--
-(grunts)

40:31.095 --> 40:32.930
I come back, you know that, man?

40:33.013 --> 40:34.348
I come back from hell!

40:35.057 --> 40:36.642
Nobody here made it easy for me!

40:36.725 --> 40:38.936
And now, finally, I do one thing right...

40:39.979 --> 40:42.064
and now they're gonna
take it away from me.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.112
(sobbing) Mike came home
for about an hour,

40:48.737 --> 40:50.406
tearing around the house like a...

40:51.824 --> 40:57.163
Oh, he said, "Don't believe anything
the cops say because it's a railroad."

40:58.539 --> 41:02.626
But, oh, God help me, Captain,
I told you what's been going on.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.007
I'm so afraid for him.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.550
Please...

41:10.593 --> 41:12.636
just don't punish him anymore.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.347
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Mike...

41:15.973 --> 41:18.017
I don't understand this.
Now, why are you here?

41:18.642 --> 41:22.104
Because you're in trouble,
because I love you, Mike.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.231
What have you been telling him, huh?

41:24.315 --> 41:26.025
She's trying to help you, Mike.

41:27.401 --> 41:31.197
I told him we can't go on like this
with you this way.

41:31.697 --> 41:32.573
I told him...

41:34.158 --> 41:38.537
what you said yesterday
about this being the day for you.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.706
(crying) Who told you to say that?

41:41.332 --> 41:42.875
You're supposed to be my wife.

41:42.958 --> 41:47.296
(crying) Mike, you're destroying yourself.
Please.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.131
It's over, Mike.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.510
Okay.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.847
Okay. (sniffles)

41:57.264 --> 41:58.390
(Mike crying)

41:58.474 --> 42:00.559
(siren wails in distance)

42:06.357 --> 42:07.900
Why did you do this, Mike?

42:10.611 --> 42:13.822
-Why?
-Just to do something...

42:15.407 --> 42:17.034
to have something, at least, so...

42:18.786 --> 42:21.163
they wouldn't look at me
like I was still that guy...

42:22.498 --> 42:23.374
that cop that...

42:25.793 --> 42:26.835
that killed a kid.

42:29.421 --> 42:31.465
So I wouldn't be dead meat.

42:31.966 --> 42:35.261
I-I've been dead meat, Captain.

42:39.014 --> 42:40.224
People could have died.

42:41.809 --> 42:42.851
Hey, come on.

42:43.936 --> 42:45.396
Do you think I'm crazy?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.773
"Crazy Perez torches people"?

42:48.232 --> 42:51.735
Goins--he set the fire way in the back.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.239
I-I was right there from the jump.

43:02.454 --> 43:04.665
At the very least, a boy was cut.

43:08.627 --> 43:10.504
Some young children were panicked.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.967
A family of squatters
lost all their possessions.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.887
At worst, people could have died.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.851
(crying) I feel like I'm dying.

43:31.066 --> 43:32.526
Do you like this?

43:32.610 --> 43:36.864
Do you like to see a guy
who died at 34 years old?

43:41.660 --> 43:43.704
No, I-I'm okay.

43:44.163 --> 43:47.458
I am okay now, Captain.

43:49.710 --> 43:52.755
What's gonna happen to the medal now?
Gone, huh?

43:54.798 --> 43:57.259
The whole shot, in the papers,
just like last time.

43:59.011 --> 44:02.014
Well, because the chief spoke so fast...

44:04.433 --> 44:05.559
there'll probably be some of that.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.481
Not the joint, though, huh?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.193
They wouldn't put me in the joint,
would they?

44:17.321 --> 44:18.822
I can't say that for sure.

44:22.951 --> 44:26.997
Uh, I'm sorry about that
Latino thing, Lieutenant.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.958
I'm sorry about screwing that up for you.

44:31.126 --> 44:32.211
Stay with him, Ray.

44:33.671 --> 44:37.591
Uh, I'd like to put you in county
for 72 hours or so, Mike.

44:38.425 --> 44:40.135
I'm gonna make the phone call now, okay?

44:40.719 --> 44:42.388
I'm sorry about that...

44:43.931 --> 44:45.641
Latino thing, Lieutenant.

44:52.064 --> 44:55.901
(door opens, closes)

45:02.616 --> 45:04.743
His wife said he had
four different partners last year

45:04.827 --> 45:06.495
because nobody wanted to ride with him.

45:07.830 --> 45:08.747
It's right here.

45:10.833 --> 45:14.378
And I approved every transfer
because on its merits,

45:14.461 --> 45:15.796
each one made sense.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.048
I never noticed the pattern.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.510
You've had three roll-call sergeants
in a year.

45:21.593 --> 45:22.928
None of them noticed, either.

45:23.429 --> 45:26.473
Yeah, but it's my job to notice.
I get paid to notice.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.975
Who else is gonna look out for them?

45:29.810 --> 45:32.104
The department shrink, for openers.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.984
You can't get help from the shrink
if you stop going to the shrink.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.402
And you stop going to the shrink

45:38.485 --> 45:40.612
because even though
the department provides one,

45:40.696 --> 45:44.575
it tells you in 100 silent ways
that if you go, you're branded.

45:45.701 --> 45:48.370
Not crazy, necessarily,
but just a little off.

45:51.039 --> 45:54.168
Someone maybe your partner wouldn't want
to trust his life to in a pinch.

45:54.626 --> 45:57.212
(sighs)

45:59.047 --> 46:00.174
So you tough it out.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.468
You drink.

46:05.429 --> 46:06.513
Or you kick the dog.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.685
Anything so you don't have to feel.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.690
It's as if feelings
are a cop's natural enemy.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.445
There's so much pain out there.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.616
So much madness.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.497
You shut out your feelings
just to survive...

46:34.917 --> 46:37.628
And you don't dare look up
for fear of what you might see.

46:43.175 --> 46:46.637
And, but for the grace of God,
there goes you in a ratty bathrobe...

46:51.683 --> 46:54.812
tearing at the flesh on your ankles
instead of Mike Perez.

46:56.104 --> 46:59.483
MALE ANNOUNCER (on TV): ...<i>Fletcher</i>
<i>Daniels on this exclusive report.</i>

47:00.567 --> 47:03.195
<i>...Officer Perez's misguided act</i>
<i>was met with immediate</i>

47:03.278 --> 47:04.988
<i>and understandable enthusiasm.</i>

47:05.781 --> 47:07.950
<i>Our review process is designed</i>

47:08.033 --> 47:11.119
<i>to generally avert just such</i>
<i>premature disclosure,</i>

47:11.620 --> 47:13.831
<i>as Captain Furillo unfortunately allowed.</i>

47:14.122 --> 47:16.124
<i>-However well-intentioned, his mo--</i>
-(TV turns off)

47:20.295 --> 47:22.881
Old Fletcher Daniels
is police exhibit "A."

47:26.885 --> 47:30.138
