As part of our public safety campaign,

00:50.759 --> 00:53.678
Pancho has a few words
to say on our kingdom.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.388
-Pancho.
-Thanks, Xixi.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.806
I hate to be a "Willie"...

00:56.890 --> 00:58.391
What the heck, man?

00:58.475 --> 01:00.935
...but there are a lot
of unlocked doors in the kingdom

01:01.019 --> 01:03.897
and someone, not me, could easily sneak in

01:03.980 --> 01:06.149
and go through your stuff
for fun or profit.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.069
Not me, but... like, someone else.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.113
[groans] Why is the news so boring?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.573
Maurice, what's on next?

01:13.656 --> 01:16.993
-Uh, Xixi.
-[groans loudly] And after that?

01:17.077 --> 01:17.911
More Xixi.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.621
[groans more loudly]

01:19.704 --> 01:23.625
All I'm saying is that for a fee,
you know, like a nominal fee,

01:23.708 --> 01:27.128
I could offer insurance
against these kind of break-ins.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.882
Gee, Pancho, that sounds
a little like extortion.

01:30.965 --> 01:35.678
-Your word, Xixi, not mine.
-Okay. Why don't we go to commercial?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.180
[drum roll]

01:37.263 --> 01:39.641
Hey, kids, do you like scorpions?

01:39.724 --> 01:40.683
[all] Yeah!

01:40.767 --> 01:42.644
Well, then you're gonna love

01:42.727 --> 01:46.898

Kids these days are so lucky.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.826
Enough! I can't watch any more.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.579
My peoples work hard watersliding
and avoiding being eaten.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.249
They need a show that lets them
escape from reality.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.918
Where's the chair throwing
and interspecies love triangles?

02:07.001 --> 02:10.088
I'll put on a show for you, King Julien.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.381

02:17.011 --> 02:20.431
Andy, where are you going?
We still have another segment.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.392
Fiber: Friend or Foe?  [laughs]

02:22.475 --> 02:25.270
I need to sell product
and this show is a dud.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.272
I'm going over to the Crocodile Kingdom.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.524
At least those guys know entertainment.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.109
[stuttering] What you say what?

02:31.192 --> 02:32.986
The Crocodiles are making shows?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.195
You bet they are.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.406
They got a crazy new show
that's crushing it.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.992
Is everyone ready to play...

02:39.576 --> 02:41.161
[all]  That's a croc!

02:41.244 --> 02:42.745
First question.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.915
When dining on another species,
one should always

02:45.999 --> 02:49.043
milk the marrow from the bones
before dessert.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.422
True or that's a croc? Five seconds.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.132
Oh. Oh, my.

02:54.215 --> 02:58.094
Such a fine line with marrow.
Uh, I believe... Yes, true. True!

02:58.177 --> 03:00.179
You have to push the button, sir.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.098
[groaning]

03:02.181 --> 03:04.350
Oh! Eh, I... I can't.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.019
[all laughing]

03:06.102 --> 03:07.020
[buzzer sounds]

03:07.103 --> 03:09.105
I'm sorry, sir, time's up.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.567
No! I knew that one. Not fair.
This game is a sham!

03:12.650 --> 03:13.902
[sobbing]

03:13.985 --> 03:15.445
[all]  That's a croc!

03:15.570 --> 03:18.364
[laughing heartily]
That actually sounds like a good show.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.658
For idiots, Your Majesty.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.329
The crocodiles are trying
to exploit our entertainment weakness

03:24.412 --> 03:25.872
to lure our people away.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.332
How did I not know of this?

03:27.415 --> 03:30.001
Maurice, you're
the Minister of Information.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.794
There is no Minister of Information.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.754
Exactly.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.130
We have to stop them.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.675
[sighs] Whatever he comes up with,
we've got to stop him

03:37.759 --> 03:39.135
before he goes too far.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.053
Agreed.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.098
Step right up, folks.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.309
The show is about to begin.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.436
[Xixi] Comin' in hot!

03:48.519 --> 03:49.437
[all exclaim]

03:49.520 --> 03:51.898
Oh, did I miss the king's big surprise?

03:51.981 --> 03:55.276
Nope. Whatever the "surprise" is,
it hasn't started yet.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.569
Where is Clover?

03:56.819 --> 03:57.946
-[explosion]
-[all gasp]

03:58.029 --> 04:00.907
[melodramatic instrumental music playing]

04:04.160 --> 04:06.746
Look around you, what do you see?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.248
Real life.

04:08.331 --> 04:14.754
Well, I'm here today to say
who needs real life?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.173
[shouts] We're all gonna die!

04:17.257 --> 04:20.093
You see?
That is what real life has done to you.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.595
So obsessed with dying. With fear.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.806
Well, what the heck else is there?

04:24.889 --> 04:26.266
When I was elected,

04:26.349 --> 04:28.559
I promised I was going to change things.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.395
But you can't change real life.

04:30.478 --> 04:34.023
It gets on everything like a fungus,
it's all green and squishy,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.150
and maybe some little bugs in a yurt...

04:36.234 --> 04:39.570
Anyway, I figured,
if you can't change real life,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.240
why not find a way to ignore it?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.701
Please take a controller and pass it down.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.785
There's enough for everyone.

04:45.868 --> 04:49.163
[Julien] What you are holding
in your hands is choice, peoples.

04:49.247 --> 04:53.376
Choice to tune out real life
and tune in something new.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.878
Something that will let you
forget your troubles

04:55.962 --> 04:57.922
with a simple turn of a dial.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.382
Oh, my stars, what is it?

04:59.465 --> 05:02.552
It sounds so wonderful,
I think I'm gonna joy tinkle.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.178
Oops. There goes a dribbler.

05:04.262 --> 05:09.100
It is KJ-branded entertainment
guaranteed to make you forget

05:09.183 --> 05:11.561
about your boring, painful,
reality filled lives.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.938
I call it Julien-Vision!

05:14.647 --> 05:15.940
[female voice]  Julien-Vision.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.859
[male baritone voice]  Oh, yeah!

05:17.942 --> 05:19.777
Maurice, what is this?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.654
I'm getting the same anxious feeling I get

05:21.738 --> 05:23.990
when a celebrity couple
hires a young nanny.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.368
Don't worry, Clover and I were prepared
for something like this. [laughs]

05:27.452 --> 05:29.078
Clover? [shouts] Clover, where are you?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.039
Let's see what's on.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.166
[all screaming]

05:33.249 --> 05:35.460
[Julien] She's the stage mom
you love to hate.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.544
[crowd chattering]

05:36.627 --> 05:40.048
Prepare yourself for  Unleash the Beast!

05:40.298 --> 05:44.677
All right, my little angels,
let's see some  Grande Jetes,

05:44.761 --> 05:45.970
or so help me,

05:46.054 --> 05:50.058
I will not be able
to control [shouts] Todd!

05:50.141 --> 05:54.020

-[lemur kids screaming]

05:54.771 --> 05:57.899
[Julien] He's the jungle's
freakiest bachelor.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.610
Welcome to  The Single Life.

06:00.985 --> 06:06.074
Hey, girl... [sips] What's your sign?

06:06.157 --> 06:08.993
Mine's "Full Speed Ahead."

06:09.077 --> 06:10.328
[chuckles]

06:10.578 --> 06:11.913
[laughs]

06:11.996 --> 06:14.582
Get ready for  Hot Jungle Nights

06:14.665 --> 06:18.086
with Madagascar's favorite
crime fighter, Clover!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.046
Oh, no, she didn't.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.048
Ello, ello, ello.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.050
-What's all this about then?
-[gasps]

06:24.133 --> 06:27.178
You can't come in here without a warrant.
It's against the law.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.972
There's only one law in this jungle. Me!

06:30.056 --> 06:31.766
Ki-yah! Ha! Ha!

06:31.849 --> 06:35.019
Remember, kids, don't play with matches.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.896
You might get burned.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.898
[laughing, applause]

06:39.732 --> 06:40.817
[screams]

06:40.900 --> 06:44.237
Look at them, Maurice.
Who needs real life?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.197
Julien-Vision is a hit.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.866
I'm your royal advisor.
I should have been told!

06:48.950 --> 06:51.494
Yeah, but then you would have
tried to stop me like you always do

06:51.577 --> 06:54.622
and I would have just done it anyway.
So, ya know, this saved time.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.540
Woo! A-ha!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.250
Did you hear that applause?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.919
Star quality. Right here. Oh, yeah!

07:00.002 --> 07:03.089
I thought we were supposed to
stop this together! What happened?

07:03.172 --> 07:04.132
Hello?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.425
My own show happened. Jealous?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.636
Are you going to cancel me?

07:08.719 --> 07:11.597
[sobbing] Oh, no! My show is all I have!

07:11.681 --> 07:15.017
Without it, I'll have to face
my dubious life choices!

07:15.101 --> 07:16.102
Please, no!

07:16.185 --> 07:18.229
You're not canceled, Xixi.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.731
But I am going to need you
to step up your game.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.276
No problem. I won't let you down.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.610
[groans]

07:25.736 --> 07:28.030
You and Xixi have been friends
since childhood.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.991
You wouldn't really cancel her show,
would you?

07:30.074 --> 07:33.119
Of course not, Mo-Mo,
but it's not up to me.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.163
Julien-Vision is about choice.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.249
My peoples decide what they want
or don't want.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.501
It's in their hands now.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.921
[clamoring]

07:44.005 --> 07:48.342
Gonna be a lot of empty huts
if everyone's watching Julien-Vision.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.137
And a lot of unlocked doors.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.513
[cheering]

07:53.473 --> 07:54.474
[all] Whoa!

07:54.557 --> 07:55.391
[phone ringing]

07:55.475 --> 07:57.935
This is Maggie, Mistress of the Unknown.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.312
What's your question?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.856
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.483
I bet that hurts.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.902
Hold on, let me consult the sky gods.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.446
[farts]

08:08.571 --> 08:10.907
I hope that was the answer
you were looking for.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.325
Next caller.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.994
[Mort] Oh, please, King Julien.
[Julien] No!

08:15.077 --> 08:18.873
I am not putting on a show
about you painting pictures of my feet.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.625
[kissing]

08:20.708 --> 08:21.959
Argh! Don't lick it.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.961
-[grunts]
-[screams, groans]

08:24.045 --> 08:25.338
King Julien, we have a problem.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.090
I'm glad you're here.
I'm beefing up our comedies

08:28.174 --> 08:32.178
in case the crocodiles get wind of our
awesome programming and try something.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.596
I'm sorry, but this can't wait--

08:33.679 --> 08:37.475
Okay, check it,
it's a pair of mismatched roommates...

08:37.558 --> 08:38.976
[laughs]

08:39.060 --> 08:41.103
and they are living in a cave.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.230
[thunder rumbling]

08:42.355 --> 08:43.856
[applause]

08:43.940 --> 08:46.817
Nurse Phantom, where are my beakers?

08:46.901 --> 08:50.238
In the lab where they belong,
and not with my good china

08:50.321 --> 08:53.407
where I found them.
Now sit down, dinner is ready.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.992
[audience laughing]

08:55.076 --> 08:56.452
I'm not hungry.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.954
-[audience] Ooh.
-Gah!

08:58.037 --> 09:03.084
Do you have any idea how long it took me
to make that turkey pot pie

09:03.167 --> 09:06.170
on an island
[shouts] where there are no turkeys?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.588
[audience laughing]

09:07.672 --> 09:13.844
Mamma Mia , why did we ever
become roommates [shouts] in a cave?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.555
-Ha-ha.
-Your Majesty,

09:15.638 --> 09:17.807
the kingdom has come to a grinding halt

09:17.890 --> 09:22.228
because everyone is either watching
or starring on [shouts] Julien-Vision!

09:22.311 --> 09:25.898
[gasps] I had no idea. Everyone?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.567
Well, there's still a small group--

09:27.650 --> 09:30.820
What? Why aren't they watching?
Get them in those seats!

09:30.903 --> 09:33.239
I'm curing the boredom
and stress of reality, Maurice!

09:33.322 --> 09:35.408
-It's a pretty big deal.
-We've got a problem.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.826
Oh, man, not you too.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.327
-Ahh!
-[Mort grunts]

09:38.786 --> 09:40.037
Just ahh!

09:40.121 --> 09:44.041
Welcome back to our
ripped from the headlines exclusive

09:44.125 --> 09:46.168
Fiber: Friend or Foe?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.715
I have always had tummy issues.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.258
-Gurgle, gurgle.
-[stomach gurgling]

09:52.341 --> 09:54.093
Is there a monster in there?

09:54.176 --> 09:56.345
I hope not. [laughs]

09:56.429 --> 10:00.224
That's when I discovered
I could make my own gecko cheese

10:00.308 --> 10:01.684
and you can, too.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.935
[all exclaim in disgust]

10:03.019 --> 10:06.105
To start, get yourself a half dozen geckos

10:06.188 --> 10:08.691
and attach hoses to their milking bits.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.651
-Oh, thundering pony thighs!
-[geckos screeching]

10:10.735 --> 10:12.778
-[Ted] Help!
-This is the problem?

10:12.862 --> 10:16.073
Fine, giving Ted his own cooking show
was a mistake.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.116
Can I go now?

10:17.199 --> 10:18.534
-Uh...
-Keep watching.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.788
[sighs in relief] That's better.
They've brought reinforcements.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.373
-[geckos screeching]
-[screaming]

10:26.417 --> 10:27.460
Welcome back!

10:27.668 --> 10:28.753
[farting]

10:30.713 --> 10:32.089
[screeching, rumbling]

10:32.673 --> 10:34.508
-[thud]
-That is the problem.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.054
The kingdom can't decide what to watch
and all the show flipping

10:38.137 --> 10:41.599
is putting strain on the platform.
I'm not sure she can hold.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.975
[creaking]

10:43.267 --> 10:47.605
Hello, and welcome back
to  Still life with Feet.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.357
No! No, Mort!

10:49.523 --> 10:54.862
Oh, it's very important
to get just a hint of rosy pink

10:54.945 --> 10:58.282
on King Julien's toe webbing. Oh...

10:58.366 --> 10:59.533
[Julien grunts]

10:59.617 --> 11:01.077
Give me that painting right now!

11:01.160 --> 11:02.453
-[Mort grunting]
-[audience laughs]

11:02.536 --> 11:05.081
-Now, you demented imp!
-It's not finished!

11:05.414 --> 11:06.248
[Julien groans]

11:06.540 --> 11:07.917
[laughing continues]

11:08.000 --> 11:09.377
-[Mort grunting]
-[crashes]

11:09.460 --> 11:12.338
[both grunting]

11:13.422 --> 11:15.716
No, don't touch those dials, please!

11:15.800 --> 11:18.552
[sobs] I'll do anything you want!

11:18.636 --> 11:22.807
I have no self esteem! [bawling, groans]

11:22.890 --> 11:24.892
[farting]

11:25.309 --> 11:26.352
[grunts]

11:26.435 --> 11:27.561
[Mort screaming]

11:27.686 --> 11:28.604
No, you can't...

11:28.771 --> 11:30.189
[bawling]

11:30.272 --> 11:32.983
I'm an only child!

11:33.401 --> 11:36.195
Oh! Oh, golly, I think I swallowed some!

11:37.947 --> 11:39.657
[Julien] No means no, Mort!

11:39.740 --> 11:41.659
Get out of my spotlight.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.661
[Mort screaming unintelligibly]

11:43.744 --> 11:45.329
She's gonna blow!

11:45.413 --> 11:46.580
-[Timo screams]
-[gasps]

11:46.664 --> 11:47.623
[lemurs screaming]

11:47.706 --> 11:48.582
[explosion]

11:50.543 --> 11:52.253
Your Majesty, watch out!

11:52.420 --> 11:54.463
[grunting]

11:56.424 --> 11:58.175
[Clover screaming]

12:01.637 --> 12:02.471
Huh?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.474
[gasps] Julien-Vision!

12:05.558 --> 12:08.185
[crying] It's ruined!

12:08.269 --> 12:12.565
-[Ted] We love King Julien! Yeah!
-[lemurs cheering]

12:12.648 --> 12:13.649
Uh...

12:13.774 --> 12:16.318
Okay, weird. Is it brain damage, Timo?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.195
Are we going to have to put them all down?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.530
No, Your Majesty.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.241
You gave the kingdom a choice
of what shows they wanted to watch

12:22.324 --> 12:24.410
and it appears they chose... you.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.328
-All four of you.
-[Maurice] Um...

12:26.412 --> 12:27.246
[all] Us?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.708
Oh, no. I know that look.
You can't, Your Majesty.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.876
This is our lives.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.253
The peoples have spoken, Mo-Mo!

12:34.503 --> 12:38.966
Buckle up, kingdom,
things are about to get real!

12:42.178 --> 12:43.429
[hip-hop instrumental music playing]

12:57.109 --> 13:02.323
[sipping] Maurice! Where have you been?
You'll never believe what's happened.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.407
[sighs]

13:05.242 --> 13:07.369
King Julien and I
had important business to discuss,

13:07.453 --> 13:10.456
but when I saw the big coconut,
I knew we were in trouble.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.046
Someone has given Sir Tony
a cashmere beret?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.506
You know about his allergies.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.007
-[sneezes]
-Ugh!

13:20.090 --> 13:22.885
Your Majesty, the black and white
cupcake party is tonight

13:22.968 --> 13:25.137
and Clover still hasn't RSVP'd.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.682
Impossible. This is the cupcake event
of the season, y'all.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.477
-She'd never miss that.
-[Mort] Think again, girlfriend.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.398
I heard her down by the waterslide
saying she was too good to go--

13:36.815 --> 13:37.816
[screams]

13:37.942 --> 13:39.735
Oh, no! Help me! [gurgling]

13:39.985 --> 13:41.904
Girlfriend, you best be lying

13:41.987 --> 13:45.741
or so help me, Miss Clover gonna see
the business end of my prosthetic leg.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.160
-You don't have a prosthetic leg.
-Hmm.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.331
Oh, yeah, this was gonna get bad.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.917
Bummer, because I was
really looking forward

13:55.000 --> 13:56.835
to decorating some cupcakes.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.629
Here's one I made earlier.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.381
That's real stolen hair right there.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.801
Isn't it amazing? It's so real!

14:03.884 --> 14:05.386
It's like we're right there!

14:05.469 --> 14:07.346
We are right there, ya moron.

14:07.429 --> 14:11.392
I know! Who needs ambition and dreams
when we can live vicariously

14:11.475 --> 14:12.935
through King Julien?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.812
I have to run home and joy tinkle.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.066
If  The All Hail King Julien Show
gets a spinoff,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.693
we're gonna need a bigger cave.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.737
Forget the cave.
We're gonna need a bigger island.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.323
[both laughing]

14:27.491 --> 14:29.952
-[thuds]
-Hey! Buttered tortillas!

14:30.035 --> 14:31.203
We've been robbed!

14:32.079 --> 14:35.124
I better tinkle quick and get back
before I miss something good.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.502
Who would have thought
that when I created Julien-Vision,

14:38.586 --> 14:40.880
I would end up as its greatest star?

14:40.963 --> 14:43.674
Uh, how is our show doing
against the competition?

14:43.757 --> 14:45.009
What competition?

14:45.092 --> 14:47.136
You canceled all the other shows
except for Xixi's

14:47.219 --> 14:49.096
and we both know you won't cancel that.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.515
My friendship with Xixi is a gift.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.142
-Cancel it.
-What?

14:53.225 --> 14:56.437
The peoples want all KJ all the time.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.147
Xixi will understand when you tell her.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
Me? No way!

14:59.815 --> 15:02.026
Well, I can't do it. I'm her friend.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.027
So am I!

15:03.110 --> 15:05.404
[Xixi] Comin' in hot!

15:05.487 --> 15:06.447
Your Majesty--

15:07.865 --> 15:10.242
-You did not just run away!
-[Julien] Yes, I did.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.119
[groans]

15:12.369 --> 15:14.705
Maurice, where did King Julien go?

15:14.788 --> 15:17.750
Xixi, I don't know how to say this...

15:17.833 --> 15:19.501
Oh, no. Is my show canceled?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.545
Is that why King Julien ran away?

15:21.670 --> 15:24.381
[bawling] No!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.674
I'm freaking out!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.343
Stop! Breathe, Xixi!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.178
Your... Your show's not canceled!

15:29.261 --> 15:31.263
[crying] It's not?

15:31.347 --> 15:34.767
No. But even if it was,
would that be so bad?

15:34.934 --> 15:38.437
Trust me, it is no picnic
being on a hit show.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.605
[exclaims in surprise]

15:39.688 --> 15:44.360
Hey, everybody, look,
it's Maurice, the sensitive one.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.530
Yeah, yeah. Somebody get a baby giraffe
to make him cry.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.407
[all laugh]

15:50.532 --> 15:52.201
[all] Cry! Cry! Cry!

15:52.284 --> 15:54.787
I have feelings! [sobbing]

15:54.870 --> 15:55.704
See what I mean?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.082
Yeah, but that's
just because you're self-aware,

15:58.165 --> 16:00.376
whereas I am way too shallow to care.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.377
[sighs]

16:01.460 --> 16:04.463
Just come up with a reality
that people actually care about.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.508
Something they can't get from
The All Hail King Julien Show.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.594
-Do that and everything will be fine.
-Hmm.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.972
[Andy] It's like stealing
candy from a baby.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.642
I wonder what it'd be like
to steal a baby from a baby,

16:16.725 --> 16:18.602
-know what I'm saying?
-I do not wanna share

16:18.686 --> 16:20.354
a bathroom with you. Hoo-ah.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.692
-[audience] Ooh!
-[exclaims]

16:24.775 --> 16:26.110
Uh. What's that, Mort?

16:26.193 --> 16:27.569
[laughs]

16:27.653 --> 16:28.529
Good one.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.197
King Julien can hear my thoughts?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.573
Must be more careful.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.242
I can't let my thoughts betray me.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.620
You can cut the charade,
Your Majesty, whateva!

16:36.704 --> 16:38.914
I know you've just been waiting
to see if I'd show up.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.374
[all] Ooh!

16:40.457 --> 16:42.126
[stammering]

16:42.209 --> 16:43.585
Where have you been, Clover?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.963
You know how much
this black and white cupcake party

16:46.046 --> 16:49.091
that I only came up with yesterday
to fabricate controversy for the show

16:49.174 --> 16:50.551
means everything to me!

16:50.634 --> 16:51.927
You canceled my show!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.846
That's right. My... show!

16:53.929 --> 16:56.598
Technically, the peoples
canceled your show.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.892
-Oh. I am done.
-[snapping]

16:58.976 --> 17:01.353
I am done!

17:01.687 --> 17:04.982
I could not believe Clover gave me
the "sassy shut-up" hand.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
[sighs] I had to go nuclear.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.988
It appears you've left me no choice
but to recast.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.239
You can come out!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.576
[all gasp]

17:15.659 --> 17:16.994
Nurse Phantom!

17:17.077 --> 17:19.121
[sobbing] How could you?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.832
FYI, I'm taking your catchphrase.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.791
[slurps]

17:22.875 --> 17:23.709
On it!

17:23.834 --> 17:26.128
[both grunting]

17:26.211 --> 17:28.630
Paws off the royal coiffure, Clover,

17:28.714 --> 17:31.133
or I will straight up yank out your weave.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.177
I don't have a weave.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.678
[groans]

17:36.013 --> 17:37.806
[Andy] Just like old times, Pancho.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.517
-You, me, and a dank cave full of loot.
-[exclaims]

17:41.018 --> 17:42.603
We make a pretty good team.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.188
Hey, you wanna wrestle?

17:44.271 --> 17:47.483
You know, like a bonding thing,
not weird or nothin' like that.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.318
Sure, long as it's not weird.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.569
-Oh, boy.
-[grunting]

17:50.652 --> 17:53.197
This is gonna put me back on top!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.198
[Pancho] Oh, piledriver!

17:54.281 --> 17:56.325
[audience laughing]

17:56.450 --> 17:59.703
Clover! King Julien! Stop!
What are we doing?

17:59.787 --> 18:00.662
This isn't us!

18:00.746 --> 18:02.206
Of course it is.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.584
We've just been distilled to only include
the stuff that's important,

18:05.667 --> 18:07.878
fighting and complaining
about our privileged lives.

18:07.961 --> 18:11.340
-[Xixi] Comin' in hot!
-[groans]

18:11.423 --> 18:13.050
King Julien, big news!

18:13.133 --> 18:15.761
Ugh! Xixi, now is not the time!

18:15.844 --> 18:18.097
But I've got a breaking story for my show.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.389
Show?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.058
Maurice, didn't you tell her?

18:21.141 --> 18:22.601
Tell me what?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.144
Xixi, I... uh...

18:24.353 --> 18:26.105
I was hoping I could change his mind.

18:26.188 --> 18:30.442
Look, Xixi, you know how much I love you.
I mean, respeck!

18:30.526 --> 18:35.572
But turns out the peoples want their
reality with very little actual reality.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.117
And that means
The All Hail King Julien Show

18:38.200 --> 18:40.994
twenty-four-sev, and no news.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.205
But what about when you sleep?

18:43.288 --> 18:46.333
[blows raspberry] Two words, reruns.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.962
Your Majesty, the black and white
cupcake party is tonight

18:50.045 --> 18:52.381
and Clover still hasn't RSVP'd.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.674
Impossible.

18:53.757 --> 18:57.052
This is the cupcake event of the season.
She'd never miss that.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.138
[Hector] Think again, girlfriend.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.472
Nope.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.558
-Not doin' this.
-[gasps]

19:02.641 --> 19:03.517
Xixi--

19:03.600 --> 19:05.644
Hey, nothing lasts forever, right?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.896
See ya around. [groans]

19:08.522 --> 19:09.940
Ooh. Uh...

19:10.023 --> 19:14.069
Maurice, you're the emotional one.
Did she seem upset?

19:14.903 --> 19:15.904
[growls]

19:17.072 --> 19:19.533
Well, this reality isn't any fun.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.286
If I wanted to see
hope and joy being crushed,

19:22.369 --> 19:25.205
I would have stayed home
and watched Todd. Oh.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.707
I'm really sorry to interrupt,

19:26.790 --> 19:29.126
-but [shouts] we've all been robbed!
-[both] What?

19:30.711 --> 19:31.920
[whimpering]

19:32.004 --> 19:33.505
They got my place, too.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.091
My stump wasn't touched. Weird, huh?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.593
How could this happen?

19:37.676 --> 19:39.511
-Everyone was watching Julien-Vision...
-[Mort groaning]

19:39.595 --> 19:41.471
And, oh! You've got to be kidding me!

19:41.555 --> 19:45.976
While everyone was watching Julien-Vision,
no one was watching the kingdom,

19:46.059 --> 19:48.061
including me. [sighs]

19:48.145 --> 19:49.146
Sorry, Your Majesty.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.274
I just wanted to help my peoples
hide from reality,

19:52.357 --> 19:54.484
but reality still found us.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.862
We forgot the harvest, we were robbed!

19:56.945 --> 19:58.906
You replaced me with Nurse Phantom.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.074
And I lost an old friend.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.492
-[gasps] Xixi!
-Xixi!

20:02.576 --> 20:04.286
She tried to tell us about something big!

20:04.369 --> 20:05.329
We have to find her!

20:05.412 --> 20:06.580
[dance music playing]

20:07.623 --> 20:10.000
[chattering, cheering]

20:12.628 --> 20:14.087
-Oh!
-Hey, watch it!

20:14.171 --> 20:18.800
Hey, you don't wanna ride the party train,
then get off the track!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.344
Xixi, what are you doing?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.637
Show's gone.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.639
This is where I belong now.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.809
Oh, yeah, goin' beast mode, y'all!

20:27.893 --> 20:30.270
We're never gonna die!

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
-[groaning]
-Forget about the show.

20:31.897 --> 20:35.275
A show can't define you.
Who you are is inside.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.819
And I think inside
you're pretty wonderful.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.071
You really mean that?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.405
Of course I do.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.616
And King Julien feels the same way.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.243
I know it. He'll come around.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.913
You've always been
a good friend to me, Maurice.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.290
Uh... Eh...

20:50.874 --> 20:52.209
[kissing]

20:52.292 --> 20:53.418
What are you doing?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.795
Did you just try to kiss me?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.465
Ha... I'm sorry,
I'm really fragile right now.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.925
[Julien] Xixi! Maurice!

21:01.051 --> 21:03.011
Oh! I am so glad we found you.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.305
Me, too. This club is sicknasty.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.223
Who's the DJ?

21:06.306 --> 21:07.391
King Julien!

21:07.474 --> 21:08.684
Yes. Sorry.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.019
I'm going to say this fast
because we've got kind of a crisis

21:11.103 --> 21:12.020
back in the kingdom.

21:12.104 --> 21:16.024
Xixi, despite Maurice's insistence
on creating other shows to watch,

21:16.108 --> 21:19.069
for me, your show is the only one we need.

21:19.152 --> 21:23.282
I'm officially canceling Julien-Vision
and un-canceling your show.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.866
Please come back to the kingdom.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.120
It wouldn't be the same
without my oldest, dearest friend there.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.371
I don't know what to say.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.039
[mumbling]

21:31.790 --> 21:33.041
[kissing]

21:33.125 --> 21:34.668
You already got the show back.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.461
She's had a really long day.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.130
You said there was a crisis, King Julien?

21:38.213 --> 21:41.216
Yes, someone has robbed
the entire kingdom!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.843
Oh! I know who it is!

21:42.926 --> 21:44.553
Yeah, we thought you might.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.765
Xixi here reporting live
from the scene of the biggest heist

21:48.849 --> 21:50.434
in Madagascar's history.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.770
Pancho, Andy,
can you tell the viewers why you did it,

21:53.854 --> 21:56.148
and more importantly, who are you wearing?

21:56.231 --> 21:59.484
[yawns] Nice to have the kingdom
back to normal.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.445
Or as normal as this kingdom gets.

22:01.528 --> 22:05.282
Yes, Maurice, my peoples have learned
a valuable lesson.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.909
Real life is boring
and would be way better

22:07.993 --> 22:10.370
if we could edit it
and add a bangin' soundtrack

22:10.454 --> 22:11.788
and explosions and stuff.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.457
That's pretty much
the opposite of what I--

22:13.540 --> 22:16.126
I'm just sorry some of my
brilliant show ideas

22:16.209 --> 22:17.461
will never see the light of day.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.422
How did I get here?

22:20.630 --> 22:22.382
Hey. Don't worry, Dandelion.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.260
Remember, Orange is the new Pancho.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.929
Anyone wanna wrestle?

22:28.013 --> 22:30.140
-As long as it's weird.
-[Pancho whimpering]

22:30.265 --> 22:31.183
[roars]

22:31.266 --> 22:33.602
[crocodiles laughing]

22:33.685 --> 22:36.480
I can't believe King Julien
didn't pick this show up.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.482
This is genius!
