WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:09.360
Rotten.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.200
Try another?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.760
They all be the same, Ambrose!

00:13.760 --> 00:16.120
Well... what are we going to
tell the squire?

00:16.120 --> 00:17.280
'Tis not just the squire.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.000
The entire village
shall suffer for this.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.920
And they shall hate us for it.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.880
We'll be driven
out of the parish, boy!

00:25.320 --> 00:26.800
Unless...

00:26.800 --> 00:28.120
Oh!

00:29.600 --> 00:32.520
Come back in thy basket,
little bread.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.640
Strange woman, talks to herself,
lives alone.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.480
Well... her husband
died in an accident.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.480
Accident, was it?

00:41.480 --> 00:42.840
Perhaps she cursed him.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.760
Perhaps she summoned
this frost, cursed the crops?

00:48.320 --> 00:49.960
Ohhh!

00:49.960 --> 00:54.400
We'd best tell the squire
we have a witch in our midst.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.880
Until, finally,

01:18.880 --> 01:20.360
the crowd dispersed.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.120
And that is what happened...

01:28.120 --> 01:29.640
...to me.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.600
I'll be having nightmares
about that.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.360
You didn't see it live. Uh.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.800
Those horrible men!
Gracious me!

01:37.800 --> 01:38.840
Wish I'd never heard it.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.800
Well, you wanted to know...
I know, and I'm sorry.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.800
Now, we have run over a bit.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.080
Now, I know we were supposed to play
"if I could invite four people,

01:51.080 --> 01:54.040
"living or dead, to my dinner party,
who would they be and why"...

01:54.040 --> 01:57.040
Nicole, Natalie, Melanie and
Shaznay, because, All Saints.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.520
...but given the nature of what we've
just heard, I think it only right

02:00.520 --> 02:04.920
that we cancel that... Good.
...and take some time to reflect.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.000
Really?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.120
Quite right.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.120
Right, well, erm... I mean...

02:10.120 --> 02:14.440
...what will I do? I...just...
Right. Excellent. Over here.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.680
You seen this energy bill?

02:17.680 --> 02:19.160
Hmm? Hmm?

02:20.560 --> 02:22.040
What?!

02:22.040 --> 02:24.520
That must be a mistake.
Yeah, must be.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.880
I'll call them. Yeah. I mean, I know
they've gone up, but...

02:27.880 --> 02:29.680
Oh, Mike. It's the Gatehouse.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.680
Ohhh! Why didn't
we think about that?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.800
Wasn't it on the spreadsheet?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.240
No. And everything was on there.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.080
Even the little shampoos
and variety cereals. Man!

02:38.080 --> 02:40.800
Why can't we be like
business-y people that...

02:40.800 --> 02:44.600
You know, adults that say business-y
words and drive nice cars?

02:44.600 --> 02:47.920
Ohh! Mike, have you seen the stone
from my mum's ring?

02:47.920 --> 02:50.040
What does it look like?
Are you kidding?

02:50.040 --> 02:53.000
I've worn it, like, half the time
I've known you.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.520
Oh, yeah. The... ring. The, er, re...

02:55.520 --> 02:57.640
Green. It's deep green.
What, the green one?

02:57.640 --> 03:00.080
Yeah, yeah...
Have you seen it? No. Oh...

03:00.080 --> 03:01.320
I'll keep an eye out. Thanks.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.600
No jewel could possibly match
the jewel of thine eye.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.200
Where did you last have it?
Er, on my finger. Yeah! Fair enough.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.560
As bright as the North Star
and as rare and precious as...

03:09.560 --> 03:13.640
Thomas, please, please,
please can you give it a rest?

03:13.640 --> 03:16.840
You have to try and find
a way to stop this.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.320
Of course, my love.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.360
I mean, yes, Mrs Cooper,
I would do anything for...

03:22.360 --> 03:23.960
She's right, you know.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.200
A person should know when enough is
enough. Hmm?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.600
Look, I don't understand.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.640
It's all very well saying,
"At ease,"

03:32.640 --> 03:34.920
but what are we supposed to do
for the rest of the day?

03:34.920 --> 03:36.400
Whatever we feel like.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.240
But it's the whole day, Kitty. Oh, I
don't think about the whole day.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.480
I just think about now. How do you
decide what to do?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.800
I suppose I've never really
thought about it, I just...

03:44.800 --> 03:46.680
Oh, look! A butterfly!

03:46.680 --> 03:48.840
Hmm? Kitty!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.600
You haven't answered my question.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.440
Kitty! I say!

03:52.440 --> 03:56.120
I know what it's like, Mary.
Oh!

03:56.120 --> 03:58.000
Oh, you do? Mm.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.560
I was the subject of
a few witch-hunts myself.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.800
Ohhh... But you'll be pleased
to know

04:02.800 --> 04:04.920
that times have changed.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.880
These days, we listen to women.

04:07.880 --> 04:12.240
Well... perhaps it was
a blessings, erm, in the end.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.720
Yeah, great. But I did not think
that at the time. No, at first...

04:15.720 --> 04:18.360
Oh. There's more, is there?
Oh, good...

04:18.360 --> 04:20.080
I mean, at first I could hardly...

04:22.280 --> 04:25.880
Hello! Thought we'd introduce
ourselves. No way!

04:25.880 --> 04:29.080
Mike! Scott! How are you, man?

04:29.080 --> 04:30.600
Hey! You all right?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.640
Wait, is this...?
This is my place, yeah.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.520
You guys know each other?
Yeah! From college.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.640
Cooper?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.880
No way! Oh, my God. Hey!

04:38.880 --> 04:40.160
Wow, it's been so long. Yeah!

04:40.160 --> 04:43.760
I heard you'd inherited a mansion.
I can't believe this is it!

04:43.760 --> 04:45.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.080
I mean, you guys aren't doing so bad
yourself, with these wheels.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.760
We can't complain.
Things have been

04:49.760 --> 04:52.200
really kicking off the last couple
of years, yeah. Good!

04:52.200 --> 04:55.280
And you must be...? Oh, sorry, this
is Alison, the lady of the manor!

04:55.280 --> 04:57.040
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Laetitia and Scott.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.840
Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.800
Er, come in and have
a drink. Yeah.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.680
Our generous hosts left us this
complimentary bottle of prosecco.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.960
Oh, they sound nice.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.120
I'd leave a very good review
for that.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.560
Yeah, we will, we will. Yeah!
I've actually got to get on.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.160
But it was really nice to meet you.
And you. See you in a bit.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.160
Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah? Yeah,
yeah, catch up with your mates.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.640
I...I've been neglecting
the ghosts recently, so I should

05:19.640 --> 05:21.680
see if they need anything. Yeah.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.800
Sounds really weird
saying that out loud.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.600
Time passed slowly at first

05:32.600 --> 05:34.240
in the realm of the unlivings.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.360
Table, if you please!

05:38.360 --> 05:42.760
And I just kept myself to myself for
the first 50 years or so.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.000
"Ah, good morning, Humphrey,
and how are you?"

05:45.000 --> 05:47.440
I'm all right, thank you
very much for asking.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.920
Very good, sir, sir...

05:49.920 --> 05:53.120
But all that changed
one fateful day.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.280
Will the prayers be...?
Hush, Annie!

06:01.280 --> 06:03.120
Did you sleep at sermon?

06:03.120 --> 06:05.800
'Tis a day of humiliation
and fasting.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.680
Be silent. Search thyself
for sins of which to repent.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.520
But... I said hush!

06:11.520 --> 06:15.160
Bring not God's wrath
down upon us... woman.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.320
Mmmm! Mmmm!

06:46.320 --> 06:47.640
Uh...

06:55.080 --> 06:57.280
She was not happy to be dead.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.560
But then, I suppose
no person is at first.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.320
Be this a jape?
Why am I not in heaven?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.200
What, because of the bread?

07:07.200 --> 07:10.560
I have lived a lifetime
abstaining from all pleasures,

07:10.560 --> 07:13.960
listening to his verbal
effluence all the day long.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.000
Could not so much as cough
without furious consequence.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.800
And for what?
I was promised Eden.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.080
How do you do? I'm Humphrey.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.240
Ooh! Another one?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.360
What is that?!

07:26.360 --> 07:29.960
Er, it's a savage of some kind.
His name's Ro.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.080
Rogh!

07:31.080 --> 07:32.680
That's what I said. Ro.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.720
I think it's short
for something.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.040
Be there no-one else?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.480
Er...

07:45.040 --> 07:46.840
Right,
so you made a friend.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.280
Good. That's lovely. Now, I...

07:49.280 --> 07:51.840
Though I did not know it
at the time,

07:51.840 --> 07:54.360
Annie would be
the changing of me.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.560
That's not the end? OK.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.520
Oh, yes, each day would we...

08:00.280 --> 08:01.800
Just try to ignore her.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.000
Impossible!

08:03.000 --> 08:06.360
Can a man ignore the ocean
even as it drowns him?

08:06.360 --> 08:09.240
She just wants you to stop
the comments, Thomas.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.720
I cannot simply... She is within me.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.080
She courses through my
veins like...

08:16.080 --> 08:18.680
That's it! What?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.720
I must to go through
a complete withdrawal,

08:20.720 --> 08:22.160
remove her from my system.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.680
It was the same with opium.
I must shut myself away

08:24.680 --> 08:26.080
until the urge is gone.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.120
Ooh! Cold turkey. Bootiful.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.800
That's what it's called when you
just stop rather than cutting down.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.160
It worked for me brother-in-law
and he used to smoke

08:35.160 --> 08:36.560
30 Woodbine a day.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.880
You'll never see it through.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.320
We'll use the attic room,
gable end.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.200
Only one way out,
which Robin will guard.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.320
Yeah... No, I'm quite busy,
actually. I got to wash my...

08:48.320 --> 08:49.440
Patrick?

08:49.440 --> 08:53.360
Er... Well... I suppose,
if you really think it will...

08:53.360 --> 08:54.800
Excellent. Thank you, Patrick.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.200
It shouldn't last more than
three days. At most four.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.360
Four?!

08:58.360 --> 08:59.840
Sucker!

08:59.840 --> 09:03.640
Now, then, Patrick,
I will cry, I will beg,

09:03.640 --> 09:07.440
I will plead with you to
let me out. But you must not,

09:07.440 --> 09:09.000
under any circumstances,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.720
allow me to leave
that room. All right?

09:17.600 --> 09:21.040
I wonder if she has friends.
Butterfly friends.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.600
Well, I'm not sure that, erm...

09:22.600 --> 09:24.160
Or baby butterflies.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.880
Well, baby butterflies
are caterpillars, Katherine.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.120
Yes, of course.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.040
Yes. And one day... they come out

09:31.040 --> 09:34.560
and they are their true,
fabulous selves.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.000
Oh, it's gone. Mm.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.680
The mayfly only lives for
a day. Did you know that?

09:41.800 --> 09:45.240
Oh, which reminds me, how much of
our day do we have left?

09:45.240 --> 09:46.880
I don't know. Hmm.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.400
Right, what shall we do now?

09:48.400 --> 09:49.760
I don't know.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.360
What do you feel like?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.640
I feel like skipping.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.520
Well, I...don't know
about skipping

09:55.520 --> 09:59.280
but I could try a light trot,
I suppose. Yes...

10:00.920 --> 10:03.000
Hiya. Where are you going?
Nowhere.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.640
Just going for a walk. I'll come
with you. Er, no, thank you,

10:05.640 --> 10:07.040
Alison, no.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.680
Hi, guys! Anything you need?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.440
Fine, thank you. We're skipping.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.280
It's harder than it looks.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.560
There's a sort of rhythm
one has to master.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.440
Well, I'm around if you...
I'm around.

10:21.640 --> 10:25.800
And then, on the...
eighty... seventh day...

10:25.800 --> 10:27.200
Was it eighty-eighth?

10:27.200 --> 10:30.840
Eighty-seventh...
There was a man, and Annie did...

10:30.840 --> 10:33.000
Hey! Are you sleepings?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.760
No! No, not at all.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.520
Er, I used to get this a lot
in the House of Commons,

10:37.520 --> 10:39.640
and I shall say to you
what I said to them,

10:39.640 --> 10:40.880
which is this -

10:40.880 --> 10:45.400
I actually listen better
with my eyes closed, so...

10:45.400 --> 10:47.880
Well, as long as you are.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.320
I am. Very much so.
Please, carry on.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.840
Well, it was
the eighty-seventh day...

10:54.840 --> 10:58.000
He speaks as though
he suffers great temptation,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.320
but I tell thee, if Eve looked like
her, Adam would not have succumbed

11:01.320 --> 11:03.080
in a moment!

11:03.080 --> 11:06.640
And who are you? You look like
a great testicle with eyes. Oh!

11:08.960 --> 11:13.080
Well, so, 'tis time to return to
the nag, may the Lord keep me.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.920
May the Lord give you the runs.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.040
Every man is a...
Go on, you try.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.320
Erm... No, I cannot.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.000
Go on, say he's a wart.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.560
A scab. A crankle.
An arseworm. Go on, quick!

11:25.000 --> 11:27.480
No, I cannot. Sorry.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.520
And so began
Annie's tutelage.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.440
Determined was she
to unshackle my voice.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.760
Hello?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.520
Hi, Pat.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.560
Eh? Oh! Hi, Alison.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.920
You OK? I've got
a bit of an afternoon off,

11:47.920 --> 11:50.440
if you fancy watching some football
or Krypton Factor?

11:50.440 --> 11:54.080
Oh, my. I'd absolutely love that.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.400
But I can't. Oh? Why?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.520
Well, I've got to...
Is that her?

11:58.520 --> 12:00.160
Get her away from here.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.280
It's for your benefit, Alison.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.120
He's going cold turkey.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.240
Oh...

12:07.240 --> 12:09.240
Oh! OK.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.640
Well, I guess that just leaves...

12:12.240 --> 12:13.640
Huh?

12:13.640 --> 12:15.320
I know I've been really busy lately,

12:15.320 --> 12:18.160
so I thought I could spend some
quality time with my crew.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.000
Yeah. It's a nice day.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.840
We could see all of this nature
outside, you know?

12:24.840 --> 12:27.360
Deer? Maybe.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.520
Outside? Mm.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.480
Three mil?!

12:33.480 --> 12:34.880
Turnover, not profit.
Still!

12:34.880 --> 12:36.840
It's all about expanding now.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.280
We've just secured investment to go
international, so...

12:39.280 --> 12:41.520
This is incredible.
What about you, though?

12:41.520 --> 12:44.520
This is...
This is lovely. Yeah.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.200
Yeah, well, I mean, we've been
working really hard.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.360
The house is a money pit,
with renovations and stuff.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.520
We want to make a go of it as
a hotel, but it's just this for now.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.680
Cool, cool.
We're trying.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.480
If you wanna tell me the
secret to your success, then...

13:01.640 --> 13:04.720
Seriously, tell me
the secret to your success.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.680
Er... Honestly,
we were struggling ourselves

13:08.680 --> 13:11.680
until we joined this programme a
couple of years ago. Oh, right?

13:11.680 --> 13:15.320
Yeah. It's like an executive
success course. But it's, erm...

13:15.320 --> 13:17.520
It's kind of more supportive
than that sounds. Mm.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.480
And it's just changed
our whole thing.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.760
Taught us how to prioritise
our goals.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.240
It's actually why we're here.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.480
We're going to this big
seminar tonight in town.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.120
Oh. Tell me more.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.240
So you sacrifice your horsey,

13:29.240 --> 13:30.680
dooka-dooka,

13:30.680 --> 13:32.400
but you trick them with prawns

13:32.400 --> 13:33.760
in middle of the board,

13:33.760 --> 13:35.920
in a V formation.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.880
You always surprise me, Robin.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.080
I know you shouldn't judge
a book by its cover,

13:40.080 --> 13:42.000
but I often forget how cultured...

13:42.000 --> 13:43.160
Squirrel!

13:46.440 --> 13:47.720
I lost it.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.920
Sorry, you were saying?

13:49.920 --> 13:51.320
Oh, no. Well, I was just...

13:51.320 --> 13:52.840
There it is!

13:52.840 --> 13:55.160
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.880
Oh, Alison.
What are you up to?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.880
Oh, I'm taking Robin for a walk. GROWLING

14:00.880 --> 14:03.560
OK. How were your mates?
Yeah, good. Really good.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.640
So they're doing really well
with their business.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.360
They're turning over,
like, millions.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.640
So, I was like, "What's
your secret?" And it turns out

14:09.640 --> 14:12.280
it's all down to this programme that
they're on that taught them

14:12.280 --> 14:14.920
everything they know and introduced
them to this whole network,

14:14.920 --> 14:16.800
and they've invited us
to a seminar - tonight -

14:16.800 --> 14:18.880
to start our own journey
of personal growth.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.520
Our journey of personal growth?

14:20.520 --> 14:22.600
Yeah. It sounds a bit culty.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.760
No. Does it?

14:24.760 --> 14:27.080
I've already said we'll go.
Well, just... Just back out.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.240
Just say we can't come.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.360
Hey!
They're coming...

14:30.360 --> 14:34.000
Hey! Did you, er, tell Alison
about the seminar?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.600
Yeah. Amazing.
I'm actually kind of jealous.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.040
There's nothing like
the first time. I cried, didn't I?

14:40.040 --> 14:43.200
Yeah, sobbed. It was magical.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.720
We brought you these sashes.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.160
Actually, I...
I know it seems a bit culty,

14:47.160 --> 14:49.120
but it's just a symbolic thing
to show

14:49.120 --> 14:51.520
that you're virgin speakers
before you make your oath.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.640
Hmm.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.880
That's your favourite colour,
isn't it, Mike?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.120
Yeah.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.280
Great. Well, we'll drive.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.880
Shall we pick you up
from the house at five?

15:00.880 --> 15:03.600
Yeah. Can't wait for you to meet
the High Shepherd.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.400
Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.960
Bye.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.880
Going to meet
the shepherd.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.120
I think they'll be
great additions to the flock.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.520
Well done. I thought you were going
to say something.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.600
We shall practise
upon this fellow.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.280
What shall I say?

15:22.280 --> 15:25.880
Speak just as you choose. Utter
anything your mind can conjure.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.960
Thou art a skinny man...

15:30.960 --> 15:32.760
Mm-hm.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.680
...wi-with stick arms

15:34.680 --> 15:36.440
and a pumpkin head...

15:38.080 --> 15:41.400
...and hay hands.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.240
Right. Them's just facts, though.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.760
Yeah.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.560
Oh, Mary...

15:50.480 --> 15:54.160
# And that one is a teddy bear

16:09.000 --> 16:12.160
# Done! ♪

16:13.680 --> 16:16.680
Ah. That was a very jolly
sing-song, Kitty.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.160
Wasn't it? Yes,
and it must have killed...

16:19.160 --> 16:22.080
What do you think? Two hours or...?
That's your problem.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.320
Why would you
want to kill time?

16:24.320 --> 16:27.120
It's there to be enjoyed,
not killed. Yes, but...

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
I mean, you seem to enjoy
everything, Kitty,

16:29.080 --> 16:30.240
and I just don't know how...

16:30.240 --> 16:32.680
If you're doing it right, you don't
even notice the time.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.400
Oh! Ants!

16:34.400 --> 16:35.920
What? Oh, no, no.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.400
No, no, don't worry, Kitty.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.640
They can't... they can't touch you,
of course.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.840
Oh, yes. Yes.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.560
Ah, that one's called a soldier.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.680
There he goes.
Brave little fellow.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.720
Yeah. They can carry several times
their own body weight.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.440
Did you know that? Oh, look!

16:52.440 --> 16:54.720
There's actually two
different colonies.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.400
I think we could be witnessing
an invasion.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.400
Oh, yes. There they go,

16:59.400 --> 17:01.120
establishing a front line.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.120
Yes.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.080
But we won't be giving up
our strategic position

17:05.080 --> 17:06.720
that easily, will we, boys?

17:08.480 --> 17:11.120
Think your way through this,
Thorne, come on!

17:11.120 --> 17:14.360
Your mind is your own. If you want
to think of something

17:14.360 --> 17:16.640
other than her beautiful face,
then you can.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.160
You don't need to dwell on
the colour of her eyes

17:19.160 --> 17:21.640
or the way her lip curls
when she smiles...

17:21.640 --> 17:23.560
Don't forget her dimples.
Of course, her d...

17:23.560 --> 17:25.120
Ah! What are you doing there?!

17:25.120 --> 17:26.880
Trying to get over her, are you?

17:26.880 --> 17:30.160
It's impossible! Well, just think
of something else.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.880
As far away as you can imagine.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.760
A beach. If you like,
yeah, imagine a beach.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.440
The sea.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.800
The fish.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.520
The fishermen.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.560
Talking of the sirens at sea.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.040
Careful.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.160
The auburn-haired,
hazel-eyed beauties...

17:48.160 --> 17:51.120
...called Alison.
I can't do it! You see?!

17:51.120 --> 17:52.360
Yes.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.280
Patrick, I need to see her.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.560
No, Thomas.
Just for one second,

17:57.560 --> 17:59.960
just a glimpse, and then
I'll be fine. Then... then...

17:59.960 --> 18:01.800
You said you'd say this, mate.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.080
I know, but, Patrick, please.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.480
I have to!

18:05.480 --> 18:07.360
Just a tiny taste.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.760
No, Thomas!

18:08.760 --> 18:10.360
All right?

18:10.360 --> 18:13.000
I'm going to put my foot down.
It's for your own good.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.200
This is my foot going down. OK?

18:26.200 --> 18:29.280
I didn't know it was there.
'Twas there all along.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.720
Fastest squirrel in the world!

18:37.560 --> 18:39.480
I didn't know,
but she was there all along.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.680
She was ever so amusing!
Who are you talking to?

18:41.680 --> 18:44.000
No... No-one.
Don't stand there!

18:44.000 --> 18:46.760
Huh? You're standing on my horse.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.800
What? My horse! Montague.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.320
You're still on him.
He's a horse, Alison.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.960
This OK?
Yes. That's Montague.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.560
That's Bessie, my first dog. Bitch.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.480
That's Jasmine, the Siamese.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.400
Jasper, the falcon.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.480
And Dante. But wasn't Dante
in the house?

19:09.480 --> 19:12.120
No, that was just the crust.
We buried the meat.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.000
What? You mean,
like the giblets and the...?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.680
Now you're making it
sound disgusting!

19:15.680 --> 19:17.880
OK. So what is this? Like a...?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.880
A pet cemetery, yes.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.040
I come here once a week
to pay my respects to my beloveds.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.280
I do miss them, you know.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.960
The company.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.960
The long walks.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.560
Grooming their hair.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.040
What?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.200
So hot.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.760
So cold.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.800
Humphrey?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
Humphrey, are you awake?

20:01.680 --> 20:03.240
I love you, Thomas.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.040
No!

20:05.040 --> 20:08.040
I love you, too. Oh, God...

20:08.040 --> 20:09.760
What are you talking about?

20:09.760 --> 20:12.160
I need to get out of here.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.800
You have to help me.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.480
I am overcome with delirium.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.240
Come here, my darling.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.800
Argh! I love you, Thomas.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.120
No, my darling, please...!

20:48.120 --> 20:49.840
Kiss me, Thomas.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.360
Kiss me.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.640
Not so fast, you blighter!

20:59.240 --> 21:01.280
There's nothing to see here.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.600
Come on, you.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.960
Back to your cell!

21:05.920 --> 21:07.800
Right. Where was I?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.280
Shouting at scarecrows.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.360
Thou... is...

21:12.360 --> 21:14.360
...a acorn.
Good, good.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.720
Oh, thou, erm...

21:16.840 --> 21:19.680
Mary, say something to these.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.320
My wife's mother is visiting.
Oof!

21:22.320 --> 21:24.160
Their tongues will not have
ceased all day.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.080
Women do chatter so.

21:27.080 --> 21:30.200
No. I cannot, Annie.
It's... It's too hard.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.960
Oh, 'tis only too hard
cos you still think like a living.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.280
We were shut up all our lives,

21:36.280 --> 21:39.000
kept silent, kept in our place.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.480
Now, Mary, we are free.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.040
More free than ever in life.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.000
I shall have no peace
as long as she's in the house.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.240
The old witch.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.600
Thou art a blaggard.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.200
Thou art a snake.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
Pox-ridden boil.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.160
Yes, Mary!
Scurvy toad!

22:01.160 --> 22:03.240
Ooh!
What's the matter?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.960
Ooh, a blister on my heel.
Ha-ha.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.440
I shall have my wife bathe it
in salts 'pon my return.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.240
I'm sure 'twill please her
to do so.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.320
Oh, I'm sure she'd rather gouge her
own eyes out with a fork.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.760
Looking at thy face,

22:15.760 --> 22:19.240
I can't imagine the horror
of thy feets.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.240
Oh! How do I look?
Simply wonderful!

22:28.720 --> 22:30.680
Eurgh! Wonderfully daft.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.760
'Tis better suited to a dog.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.120
Hush now, girls.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.480
These games are
unbecoming of a young lady.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.640
Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.440
Your face is unbecoming
of a face!

22:42.440 --> 22:44.920
Yeah, you big horse's lad!

22:44.920 --> 22:46.760
The lark shall sing
its morning hymn

22:46.760 --> 22:50.080
To the bloom
of bright and gay...

22:50.080 --> 22:52.240
I sneeze better poetry
than this.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.360
Yeah. I'd rather listen
to a donkey die a slow death.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.640
Yeah, me too.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.920
So, in troth, Annie did teach
me to speak as I find.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.560
Death may take from us
many things,

23:03.560 --> 23:05.640
but it gave me a voice.

23:05.640 --> 23:10.200
I hope that whate'er is next
is even better.

23:10.200 --> 23:15.880
Well, I usually do about, erm,
five potatoes high, and then...

23:24.920 --> 23:26.120
Lucky cow.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.320
Aw...

23:30.440 --> 23:31.560
Huh.

23:36.280 --> 23:40.280
Well, I suppose we should all
just make t'most of it,

23:40.280 --> 23:43.200
until we finally receive

23:43.200 --> 23:45.120
our blessed suckings-off.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.960
Mm. Annie sounds great.
I wish I'd met her.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.560
Aye, she certainly
sounded colourful. She was.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.240
A remarkable woman.
And I should know -

23:54.240 --> 23:57.800
I've been listening since the very
start, haven't I, Mary?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.920
Ah, they're here. What do I say?

23:59.920 --> 24:01.640
Well, how should I know?

24:01.640 --> 24:04.120
People think politicians
don't listen, but, y'know,

24:04.120 --> 24:08.680
I think Mary can tell you,
this politician does listen.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.840
This politician is all ears.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.040
Well, I think...

24:13.040 --> 24:16.600
And I think it's just great
that women these days

24:16.600 --> 24:18.480
can say exactly what they want.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.920
Well, I think that...

24:19.920 --> 24:23.160
Women have never had it so good.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.400
I'm sorry, I just
think that's great.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.760
Hey! Hey. Hey...

24:27.760 --> 24:29.800
So...
Just look at Alison.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.360
She's never afraid to speak
her mind.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.000
You guys feeling ready?
Perhaps you can say what you want,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.960
but it's not without consequence,
is it? Have you got some dry clothes

24:36.960 --> 24:39.880
to change into after the ceremony?
Oh, God. Well, about that...

24:39.880 --> 24:43.880
You can't just go around shouting,
"Hello, I'm Mrs Jellyhead -

24:43.880 --> 24:45.880
"look at my wibbly friends,"

24:45.880 --> 24:48.360
and expect to be invited
to many dinner parties.

24:48.360 --> 24:51.200
...in ages, so... Yeah, that's
a great point, Fanny.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.280
Alison, you can't talk to us.
There's people here.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.560
Alison...

24:57.560 --> 25:00.640
No, it's fine, everyone. I can
just... I can say what I want.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.880
Sorry. Sorry, that must sound mad,

25:03.880 --> 25:07.360
but don't worry, I'm not. I'm just
talking to the ghosts who live here.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.520
Say hello to our guests, guys.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.840
Hello.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.400
They say hello.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.800
Erm, there's Kitty -
she's a Georgian lady.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.240
There's Lady Button.

25:18.240 --> 25:21.320
She was actually showing me
her pet cemetery, if you can...

25:21.320 --> 25:23.720
Ooh, sorry, careful. If you
just move out of the way,

25:23.720 --> 25:26.040
cos Humphrey's body
is just walking through,

25:26.040 --> 25:29.080
and I don't know where the head is.
Anyone know?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.720
Um...
Wait, is this a joke?

25:31.720 --> 25:34.520
It's not. It's not, is it, Mike?

25:34.520 --> 25:38.160
He can't see them either, and it
drives him up the wall. Yeah.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.560
Now, then, is it time
to meet the High Shepherd?

25:42.320 --> 25:45.000
Ha...
Erm...

25:46.240 --> 25:47.920
Do you know what? It's...

25:47.920 --> 25:50.280
I've just remembered we were...

25:50.280 --> 25:54.160
Yeah, I completely forgot, but we
were told... Yeah. ..it's full.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.560
Oh. Sold out. No room, so...

25:57.560 --> 25:59.840
Maybe next time. Next time.
That's a shame. A shame.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.640
Yeah. OK. Shame.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.160
All right.
Bye!

26:03.160 --> 26:05.480
They say bye.
Later, alligator!

26:05.480 --> 26:07.120
Yes!

26:07.120 --> 26:08.640
Well done, Alison. Well done.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.040
I'm sorry, Pat. I was
in the grip of a hallucination

26:13.040 --> 26:15.440
and I wasn't myself. I swear
it will not happen again.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.880
You're damn right it won't.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.840
Another peep out of you,
and you're in the hole!

26:21.440 --> 26:23.400
You all right?

26:24.520 --> 26:26.880
No, I'm...

26:30.120 --> 26:31.720
Patrick, I have to see Alison.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.040
Oh, my God!
It's only been ten seconds.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.400
Now get back in there,
you pathetic little...

26:37.400 --> 26:39.240
I found the stone from her ring!

26:39.240 --> 26:42.120
Really?
Yes. It's under the bed.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.800
Let me tell her. She needs to know!

26:43.800 --> 26:46.640
You ain't going to
see sunlight till breakfast, pal.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.360
Now get in that cell
where you belong.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.360
Lights out!

26:51.360 --> 26:53.400
Scum.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.920
Oh, right,
that must be time for...

26:56.920 --> 26:58.440
Actually, what is that time for?

26:58.440 --> 27:00.680
What are we doing?
Where's Pat?

27:00.680 --> 27:03.640
Oh, we don't need Patrick.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.040
I'll do the lecture, shall I?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.960
Oh...
Oh, no, no.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.320
Wait, wait, wait.
It'll be something fun, like...

27:09.320 --> 27:13.320
Oh! ...like the time I met
Bryan Ferry on -

27:13.320 --> 27:16.760
wait for it - a train.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.200
Yeah. No.
I will do the talk.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.040
What are you going to teach
us? How to eat raw meat?

27:22.040 --> 27:25.200
How about how to beat
Julian at chess?!

27:25.200 --> 27:27.080
That's out of order!

27:27.080 --> 27:29.240
I'll take you down
to Chinatown, bitch!

27:29.240 --> 27:31.360
All right, calm down!

27:31.360 --> 27:33.320
Let's just take a moment,
shall we?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.800
Hang on a minute. You're late!

27:35.800 --> 27:38.160
Hmm? Am I? Oh, yes...

27:38.160 --> 27:41.000
Well, I suppose
I just lost track of time.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.760
What?!

27:42.760 --> 27:45.440
Well, I mean, what's
the rush anyway?

27:45.440 --> 27:47.040
We've got for ever.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.680
Well, we've got until seven,

27:49.680 --> 27:52.240
because that's when we're watching
Captain America.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.400
Yes, good point. As you were.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.440
A boat.
A sail.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.720
A mast.

28:07.760 --> 28:08.960
A crow's nest.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.600
Alison.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.840
Cooper.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.760
Hmm!

28:17.760 --> 28:19.480
Alison...

28:19.480 --> 28:20.840
Alison!

28:20.840 --> 28:23.400
I just wanted to tell you
I found your ring piece.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.040
Your jewel. And it...

28:25.040 --> 28:27.320
Right, let me guess, its beauty
cannot hope to match

28:27.320 --> 28:29.040
the deep pools of my eyes.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.960
No. I was just going to say
it's up in the attic room.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.040
Oh, yes!

28:37.040 --> 28:39.080
Aw, Thomas, I could kiss you!

28:44.280 --> 28:46.880
Yes. Do it.
Kiss me hard on the mouth.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.200
Kiss me for ever.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.680
Oh, God, no!

28:51.080 --> 28:53.960
I tried so hard!
