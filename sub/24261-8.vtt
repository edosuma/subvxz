17:13.432 --> 17:15.099
I would leave those behind

17:15.166 --> 17:17.869

have a comfort zone.

To get that much little detail

21:30.188 --> 21:31.723
in a little space like that,

21:31.790 --> 21:33.091
that's a tough job to do,

21:33.158 --> 21:34.693

you totally killed it.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.128

21:36.194 --> 21:38.063
and that's
the most important element.

rendering in the black

21:39.865 --> 21:41.400
towards the back of the tattoo,

21:41.466 --> 21:44.569

it just gets kind of weak.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.204

The way that it's shaded
and the lack of line work,

21:49.241 --> 21:52.778
it looks like
just a big, dark splotch.

that I don't normally
dabble in.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.598
- There are areas
of this tattoo

22:13.665 --> 22:15.701
where you've successfully
convinced me

22:15.767 --> 22:17.269
that you're well-versed
in black-and-gray.

22:17.335 --> 22:21.039
Where the brow casts a shadow
over the daisies,

22:21.106 --> 22:23.108
the shadow is actually curved.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.976
It makes the daisies look
like they're stuck

22:25.043 --> 22:26.311
into the eye socket.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.480
So subtle, but it's believable.

you were trying to pack color.

22:30.982 --> 22:32.651

22:32.718 --> 22:36.421
where you put down a shade
too dark,

22:36.488 --> 22:37.689

22:37.756 --> 22:39.524
"Whip it out, whip it out,
whip it out,"

22:39.591 --> 22:42.627

whipped more darkness out

22:42.694 --> 22:45.097

a muddy tone.

is the solid black,

22:47.899 --> 22:49.768
how it ends so abruptly.

22:49.835 --> 22:53.038
- That much background makes it
look like a cover-up,

but this is a nice
black-and-gray tattoo.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.541
I'm not gonna lie.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.610
There's just some techniques

23:15.160 --> 23:21.066
- Yeah. Jessie did too much,
and Don didn't do enough.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.901
- Don's looks like
a first session,

23:22.968 --> 23:24.636

a cover-up.

23:24.703 --> 23:26.271

crazy background

23:26.338 --> 23:27.506
that wasn't necessary,

23:27.572 --> 23:28.874

a rookie mistake.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.242

I feel like Jessie

23:30.308 --> 23:31.743

23:31.810 --> 23:33.111

of that tattoo

23:33.178 --> 23:35.280
where he really shined,
like in that little face.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.648
I mean, it was smooth.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.216
- Don has cleaner line work.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.818
{\an3}- But there wasn't
enough of it.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.386
- He didn't even put real lines

23:41.453 --> 23:43.355
inside of the petals
of the flower.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.590
- But when you look
at the lines

23:45.657 --> 23:48.627
of Jessie's daisies,
it is a zigzag

23:48.693 --> 23:50.362
that for a moment,
I had to wonder,

23:50.428 --> 23:52.030

{\an1}I mean, what was that bit
about the flower?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.074
It was skin tone, dude.
