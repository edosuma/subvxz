WEBVTT

00:38.914 --> 00:40.290
Be patient, boys.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.265
Now listen, l need a table
on the terrace for Friday at 9:00.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.728
Not negotiable. Tell Valentino
it's Anthony DiNozzo, we're friends.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.065
Ciao.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.566
Valentino's, huh?

02:29.816 --> 02:33.862
- Must be a special occasion.
- l'm taking Monica for her birthday.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.407
l know a place in Georgetown.
Just as romantic, half the price.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.327
That's a good idea, probie, but
Monica's not the Applebee's type.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.248
l've never seen you like this.
You really like this girl.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.836
Well, she's got the whole package.
Beauty, class, sophistication.

02:49.044 --> 02:52.172
All that's left is to decide
on the perfect gift.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.716
l thought you gave all your girls
Honey Dust.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.096
How do you--? Probie,
something you want to tell me?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.515
- lt's not my fault.
- Don't be embarrassed, Tony.

03:01.807 --> 03:06.353
l find the taste of Honey Dust
to be extremely erotic.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.314
- What a coincidence, so do l.
- l don't.

03:09.565 --> 03:12.234
Gear up. We're heading for Dumfries.
A corporal's wife is missing.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.820
Local police think
she may have been abducted.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
What did l tell you about
my personal life?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.365
She tricked me again.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.534
Why don't you tell her
how l lost my virginity?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.452
l've been meaning
to ask you about that.

03:22.661 --> 03:27.040
How does a 1 5-year-old boy
go about meeting a coquette?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.485
She means Rockette, boss.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.325
Where did these people
come from?

03:36.534 --> 03:39.203
Didn't you see the signs?
lt's yard sale day.

03:39.370 --> 03:42.373
l see.
And do Marines sell their yards often?

03:42.581 --> 03:44.875
No, it's when people gather
stuff they don't want anymore

03:45.084 --> 03:46.460
and sell it in their yards.

03:46.669 --> 03:48.629
Why would anyone want to buy
somebody else's junk?

03:48.838 --> 03:50.631
One man's junk
is another man's treasure.

03:50.881 --> 03:52.132
ln lsrael, we have a saying:

03:54.844 --> 03:56.053
Crap is crap.

03:57.555 --> 03:58.681
Her name is Jamie Carr.

03:59.056 --> 04:01.892
Police got a call from the neighbour.
No one's seen her in two weeks.

04:02.101 --> 04:04.687
- Why are they assuming abduction?
- Back door's kicked in.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.856
- McGee, you take the perimeter.
- On it.

04:07.106 --> 04:09.150
Ziva, check with the neighbour
who called it in.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.401
Tony, you're with me.

04:10.609 --> 04:13.529
ls there a reason
l'm always the one taking statements?

04:13.779 --> 04:15.698
Obviously you're good
at getting people to talk.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.867
Don't blame McGee.
l was merely being curious.

04:18.117 --> 04:20.536
- About my sex life?
- About American customs.

04:20.744 --> 04:23.581
Some of the men l've been meeting
seem to be a little,

04:23.789 --> 04:26.625
how you say, uptight?

04:27.084 --> 04:28.460
Define uptight.

04:29.753 --> 04:33.340
- Today, DiNozzo.
- On your six, boss.

04:40.139 --> 04:43.726
l feel like l just walked into
page eight of the lKEA catalogue.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.394
Used to shop there
back in college.

04:45.561 --> 04:47.563
- Really reasonable prices.
- Get to work, DiNozzo.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.237
- l take it the husband's deployed.
- lraq.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.907
- Six months into his second tour.
- They bringing him home?

04:58.115 --> 04:59.575
Depends what we find here.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.296
DiNozzo, have McGee
break out the luminol.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.465
- You got blood?
- Someone decided to clean up

05:14.673 --> 05:16.634
a 1 2-inch spot on this carpet.
What do you think?

05:19.803 --> 05:21.472
You need to relax your eyes.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.891
lt's a hidden 3-D picture.

05:24.141 --> 05:26.143
lf you look at it just right,
a palm tree appears.

05:26.977 --> 05:28.062
l think it is broken.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.606
Hey, l'm watching you guys.

05:30.815 --> 05:33.275
Kids from down the street.
They've got sticky fingers.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.027
Tell me about Mrs. Carr.

05:35.194 --> 05:36.987
She pretty much keeps to herself.

05:37.196 --> 05:38.906
Never clicked
with the rest of the wives.

05:39.156 --> 05:41.033
Are you in the military, Mr. Powell?

05:41.283 --> 05:43.786
No, my wife is.
She's a staff sergeant in the Corps.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.455
- Deployed?
- Yeah, to Wal-Mart.

05:46.705 --> 05:48.165
She should be back
in an hour or so.

05:48.332 --> 05:50.334
- What do you do?
- Well, Corps takes up

05:50.626 --> 05:53.796
most of my wife's time, so l take care
of the kids and the house.

05:54.004 --> 05:57.007
You are a domesticated
househusband?

05:57.216 --> 06:00.135
Well, l never heard it
put quite like that,

06:00.344 --> 06:02.179
but, yeah, l suppose l am.

06:02.471 --> 06:04.807
- ls crime a problem around here?
- Are you kidding?

06:05.015 --> 06:06.934
lt's a Marine neighbourhood.
We have no crime.

06:07.184 --> 06:09.061
l wouldn't say that.
You're about to get robbed.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.481
Have your wife give me a call.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.489
- Come on, get out of here.
- Run.

06:27.705 --> 06:32.126
- So much for gone but not forgotten.
- Husband's away at war, DiNozzo.

06:33.544 --> 06:35.629
People cope in different ways.

06:38.549 --> 06:41.385
She's found at least
one way to cope.

06:45.681 --> 06:48.100
Careful.
You could poke an eye out with that.

06:48.350 --> 06:51.604
Twist the end, Tony.

06:58.027 --> 06:59.820
Haviar Christian Number Five.

07:02.948 --> 07:05.367
lt's a perfume. Big in France.

07:05.743 --> 07:07.745
Maybe that's what l'll get Monica
for her birthday.

07:08.454 --> 07:11.332
- lt's $2,000 an ounce, Tony.
- Sounds steep.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.083
She's not really
a perfume kind of gal.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.920
l meant for a corporal's wife,
DiNozzo.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.546
l knew that.

07:19.089 --> 07:20.841
l found some blood drops out back.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.510
Hidden underneath some bags
of mulch.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.428
Looks consistent
with a dragged body, boss.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.721
Where exactly, McGee?

07:25.971 --> 07:28.349
On the concrete patio.
l taped off the area.

07:35.773 --> 07:37.149
Something wrong, McGee?

07:37.316 --> 07:40.361
He's fine. He's just never been
in a woman's bedroom.

07:46.826 --> 07:48.202
l've seen this room before.

07:52.122 --> 07:54.083
- ln a video clip.
- Like a porno?

07:54.792 --> 07:58.212
No, girlfriend is always e-mailing me
these lnternet videos.

07:58.462 --> 08:00.589
She sent me one
of this room last week.

08:01.841 --> 08:03.467
Why do l find that hard to believe?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.761
You never get forwarded
weird videos to your e-mail?

08:06.011 --> 08:08.597
All the time. l meant the part about you
having a girlfriend.

08:09.515 --> 08:14.937
This clip showed a woman supposedly
being murdered live on the lnternet.

08:19.358 --> 08:20.818
Why didn't you report it, McGee?

08:23.863 --> 08:26.615
l assumed it was a hoax,
a badly made snuff film.

08:26.824 --> 08:29.118
You know what happens
when you assume, McGee?

08:29.326 --> 08:31.996
Yeah. Gibbs is going to kill me.

08:32.288 --> 08:33.998
Again.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.715
Doesn't look like a hoax to me,
McGee.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.301
- Boss, l'm sorry. lt didn't occur to me--
- Abby, talk to me.

08:45.509 --> 08:47.303
l was analysing the file, Gibbs.

08:47.553 --> 08:51.765
lt's a compressed MPEG-4,
both fields are rendered using a Kodak

08:52.016 --> 08:54.935
- that scales down the number of--
- ln English, Abby.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.563
Well, from what l can tell,
it looks like the image is real.

08:57.813 --> 09:00.149
There's no signs
of layered special effects or tampering.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.901
Sorry, McGee.

09:02.693 --> 09:04.862
l want to know where it came from.
You've got an hour.

09:05.154 --> 09:07.823
Boss, l don't need an hour.
l scanned through Jamie's hard drive.

09:08.032 --> 09:09.492
l found it.

09:11.076 --> 09:13.996
That is Jamie Carr, or Rain,
on the right.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.165
Her webcam ran a direct feed
into this website.

09:16.415 --> 09:18.459
She was running a sex site
from her bedroom, Gibbs.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.669
And her murder was recorded
during a live session

09:20.878 --> 09:23.339
- and distributed throughout the net.
- By who?

09:23.547 --> 09:26.800
Anyone that could have been logged
on to the site at the time.

09:27.051 --> 09:29.637
- lt could be hundreds of people.
- Or thousands, Gibbs.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.639
There's a big market
for desperate housewives

09:31.847 --> 09:33.057
performing behind closed doors.

09:33.349 --> 09:36.852
- Some of these ladies got rich doing it.
- Or dead, Abby.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.896
- Who's the other girl?
- Net name's Skyler.

09:39.104 --> 09:41.482
She runs the site.
l traced her webcam feed

09:41.690 --> 09:43.526
back to the same neighbourhood
as Jamie Carr.

09:43.734 --> 09:47.696
lt's the residence of Sergeant Jake
Roberts, also deployed in lraq,

09:47.905 --> 09:49.156
his wife, Leanne, lives alone.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.534
- Get the car.
- You got it, boss.

09:53.202 --> 09:54.995
You know, it's not his fault, Gibbs.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.501
lf we investigated every weird video
on the lnternet, l mean, you know?

10:01.252 --> 10:03.420
Okay, you don't know, but trust me.

10:03.712 --> 10:08.676
Cyberspace is crammed full
of all kinds of bizarre things.

10:08.926 --> 10:12.555
lt's a whole new world in there, Gibbs,
and a lot of it ain't pretty.

10:12.763 --> 10:15.432
You can say the same thing
about this one, Abs.

10:20.229 --> 10:23.190
- l can't believe l didn't call it in.
- Don't beat yourself up, probie.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.734
- Same thing happened to me once.
- Really? When?

10:25.985 --> 10:30.573
Last month, frat brother e-mailed me
a video of a dachshund skateboarding.

10:30.781 --> 10:32.241
l was positive it was a fake.

10:32.491 --> 10:34.410
Then l turned on the TV
a few nights ago,

10:34.618 --> 10:37.955
<i>l saw the exact same dog
skateboarding on Letterman.</i>

10:38.247 --> 10:41.083
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?
- Probably not as much as you did

10:41.292 --> 10:42.668
when you told Ziva my life story.

10:44.128 --> 10:45.379
There's nobody home.

10:48.465 --> 10:49.925
Hasn't been for a while.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.740
Clear.

11:13.699 --> 11:15.242
Clear.

11:17.828 --> 11:19.455
lt's going to be a long night, McGee.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.870
We have two crime scenes,
one website, zero bodies.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.873
- l want some answers.
- Jamie Carr, Leanne Roberts,

11:38.123 --> 11:40.959
started the Naughty Naughty
Neighbors website nine months ago.

11:41.168 --> 11:45.088
The site has over 2,000 members
and records about 50,000 hits a day.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.591
- ls that a lot?
- Let me give you some scope here.

11:47.799 --> 11:50.010
Playboy.com, 5 million hits a day.

11:50.218 --> 11:53.263
The official NClS website,
less than 400.

11:53.472 --> 11:55.515
Which proves
what l've long suspected.

11:55.724 --> 11:59.102
Despite the conservative image,
Americans really love their porn.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.857
l mean, l was just saying basically
that Americans--

12:04.149 --> 12:06.026
Continue, DiNozzo.

12:08.153 --> 12:10.322
When Naughty Naughty Neighbors
debuted,

12:10.572 --> 12:12.115
it's just a couple
of girls in lingerie.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.994
Membership fee was 9 bucks, which
is average for this kind of content.

12:16.244 --> 12:20.790
As the clothes came off,
the admission fee went up.

12:20.999 --> 12:24.127
And up. And up.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.007
Today the fee stands at $23.95,
which is kind of high.

12:29.257 --> 12:30.884
But platinum membership?

12:31.051 --> 12:35.347
We're talking private chats and shows,
they want 45 bucks a month.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.683
l mean, can anyone say rip-off?

12:39.976 --> 12:43.355
- What?
- That's a lot of research, Tony.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.024
- l've been working from home.
- l want detailed profiles

12:46.274 --> 12:49.611
of anyone who's ever been a member
or is a member of that site.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.488
That's like thousands of people,
boss.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.406
Then you better get started, huh?

12:54.699 --> 12:56.952
You really believe this
is an obsessed voyeur?

12:57.202 --> 12:59.037
The women's identities
were protected by masks.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.956
- Half a mask.
- The odds of finding him

13:01.164 --> 13:03.166
- off a list that size--
- Are better than the odds

13:03.375 --> 13:04.668
of you winning this argument.

13:06.594 --> 13:10.140
Good news, boss. Naughty Naughty
Neighbors has a webmaster.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.143
- Web what?
- Webmaster. lt's a person that is hired

13:13.351 --> 13:15.603
to design and update the page.

13:16.646 --> 13:18.356
His name is Carter Finch.

13:18.606 --> 13:21.276
<i>ls this guy like a Super Fly
cyberpimp?</i>

13:21.443 --> 13:24.279
No. l got off the phone with
his mother. He lives in her basement.

13:24.529 --> 13:27.365
- Oh, that's kind of depressing.
- Tony, take Ziva with you.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.617
McGee, pull financial records
on both women.

13:29.826 --> 13:32.162
Already done. Both have
joint accounts with their husbands.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.247
Neither has any indication
of additional income.

13:34.539 --> 13:37.083
- Profits?
- Probably routed through a third party.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.626
Oh, the page master?

13:38.877 --> 13:42.005
- Who?
- This guy?

13:42.714 --> 13:44.340
Yeah-- No. Definitely not.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.801
No, he has less than $200
in his account.

13:47.051 --> 13:49.888
Been that way for the last year,
so the money could be anywhere.

13:55.393 --> 13:56.936
l'm going to find it.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.524
l have no idea how.

14:13.912 --> 14:15.622
What are you doing, Dr. Mallard?

14:15.789 --> 14:18.333
Performing an autopsy, Mr. Palmer.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.419
- Shouldn't we have a body?
- Usually.

14:21.795 --> 14:26.549
Sometimes, however, one is forced
to play the cards one is dealt.

14:27.091 --> 14:32.263
Often our greatest accomplishments
come from our most trying moments.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.390
The '97 NBA Finals.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.478
Jordan has food poisoning.
Still hits the Jazz up for 40.

14:38.728 --> 14:41.940
l was thinking of something
with a little more historical significance.

14:42.357 --> 14:44.776
The landings at Normandy,
for example.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.362
- Oh, D-Day.
- Yes.

14:47.612 --> 14:51.574
You know, the fighting went far
beyond the beaches, lasted for weeks.

14:51.825 --> 14:55.578
My uncle was there,
Major Monty Mallard.

14:56.121 --> 15:01.084
Yes, fatigued and injured,
he turned to his troops and said--

15:01.292 --> 15:05.255
''The French wine in this particular
region is terribly overrated.''

15:05.505 --> 15:07.924
Anyone would think you'd heard
that story before.

15:08.133 --> 15:11.761
- What do you make of the video?
- We're dealing with an amateur.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.681
Anyone with any kind of training
would have used far more pressure,

15:14.889 --> 15:16.933
making sure
the trachea was severed.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.393
She survive long, Duck?

15:18.643 --> 15:20.019
Yeah, well, a cut that shallow,

15:20.228 --> 15:23.064
the victim would go in and out
of consciousness for several minutes.

15:23.273 --> 15:28.862
The poor girl died a slow
and excruciating death.

15:29.988 --> 15:32.740
This is the first l've heard
about any snuff video.

15:32.991 --> 15:36.744
- l just knew that Jamie was missing.
- Not just Jamie, Leanne too.

15:36.953 --> 15:39.080
Do you think it has something to do
with the website?

15:39.289 --> 15:40.832
That would make sense, now,
wouldn't it?

15:40.999 --> 15:43.376
How did you not see the video?
Don't you run the site?

15:43.668 --> 15:46.796
Well, l maintain it, but l'm far too busy
to watch all the content.

15:47.046 --> 15:50.133
<i>Well, l'll bet you weren't too busy
to see the new Star Wars six times.</i>

15:50.383 --> 15:54.971
Careful with that Wookiee.
lt's a prototype from 1 978.

15:55.180 --> 15:59.851
Aren't you a little too old for toys?
These aren't toys, they're investments.

16:00.101 --> 16:02.979
There are only three '78 Wookiees
equipped with an ammo belt,

16:03.188 --> 16:04.898
and l have one of them.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.108
You don't even want to know
how much it's worth.

16:07.317 --> 16:08.526
You're right. l don't.

16:08.777 --> 16:12.906
Six hundred bucks,
but l'll sell it for twice that online

16:13.072 --> 16:16.367
via UltraCollectiblesandAuctions.com.

16:16.618 --> 16:18.661
l see you are also saving money
on rent.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.039
l can afford my own place.

16:21.247 --> 16:27.253
l just live here for my mom, you know.
She feels safer having me close by.

16:27.504 --> 16:29.798
l'm sure you provide
a high degree of protection.

16:30.381 --> 16:33.927
- Tell us about Jamie and Leanne.
- We're business associates.

16:34.219 --> 16:37.180
l manage their website and,
in exchange, get paid $1 00 a week.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.599
A hundred bucks?
The site has over 2,000 members.

16:39.808 --> 16:42.393
- At 24 bucks a pop, that's--
- Forty-eight thousand a month.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.481
Yeah, that's good. Sounds like
the girls are ripping you off.

16:46.731 --> 16:48.983
lt's only one of several websites
l've designed.

16:49.234 --> 16:51.736
l also do Dungeons and Demons,
Buxom Bimbos,

16:51.945 --> 16:53.696
and FriendsofFurries.org.

16:53.947 --> 16:56.491
- You designed Buxom Bimbos?
- How did the three of you meet?

16:56.741 --> 16:59.702
Leanne always flirted with me
when l delivered her paper.

16:59.911 --> 17:04.415
And one day l was talking about
my website, and she asked about--

17:04.624 --> 17:05.834
Back up a step there.

17:06.376 --> 17:08.461
You were a paperboy?

17:08.752 --> 17:13.383
l used to be a news distributor, okay?
''Paperboy'' is such an archaic term.

17:13.590 --> 17:17.429
- Nine-year-olds don't mind it.
- How did Jamie get involved?

17:17.887 --> 17:19.848
l guess she wanted to make
some extra money.

17:20.056 --> 17:22.016
That's one reason
l'll never get married.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.394
l can think of a couple others.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.480
When was the last time
either of them contacted you?

17:27.771 --> 17:30.066
lt's been like a month.
l mean, with a design like mine,

17:30.316 --> 17:32.235
the site pretty much runs itself.

17:35.113 --> 17:37.323
ls your mother wondering
why we're here?

17:38.950 --> 17:41.536
l kind of told her
this was for a job interview.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.335
l'll be in the car.

17:50.295 --> 17:54.090
- What do you have, Abs?
- A Ph.D. in porn.

17:54.299 --> 17:57.051
l spent the last six hours searching
through webcam files

17:57.218 --> 17:59.721
trying to find some kind of lead,
and l have consumed more porn

17:59.929 --> 18:02.474
than Tony has in his lifetime.

18:02.724 --> 18:05.685
Okay, maybe not,
but l have watched a lot of smut.

18:05.935 --> 18:07.312
You learn anything?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.939
l'm not nearly as flexible
as l should be.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.985
- Anything about the case?
- Right. l was getting to that.

18:14.235 --> 18:16.154
l filtered through all of Jamie's files,

18:16.362 --> 18:18.072
and l found the original feed
of her murder.

18:18.323 --> 18:19.949
- This helps?
- That it does.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.286
By coordinating the original stream
with the hard drive, l obtained the date

18:23.495 --> 18:25.038
and time that the file was written.

18:25.246 --> 18:28.625
l know when Jamie Carr
was murdered.

18:31.836 --> 18:34.380
Eight days ago at 9 p.m.

18:34.631 --> 18:39.594
- To you that would be 21 00 hours, sir.
- That's good work, Abby.

18:39.844 --> 18:41.638
l do what l can.

18:41.846 --> 18:48.436
And as a reward, l will treat myself
to more exciting girl-on-girl action.

18:49.854 --> 18:50.897
Ms. Sciuto.

18:51.106 --> 18:54.984
- Okay, that was quieter than Gibbs.
- Oh, that's my high-tech Model Fives.

18:56.027 --> 18:58.905
Yeah, they're designed
to dampen ambient sound.

18:59.364 --> 19:02.033
- Nice shoes. Who are you?
- Charles Sterling.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.747
- Your new assistant, ma'am.
- l did not order a new assistant.

19:07.956 --> 19:09.874
Well, that's strange.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.127
Human Resources told me
to report tonight.

19:13.044 --> 19:16.256
That's great. l tell them
that l do the work of ten people

19:16.506 --> 19:21.094
and l need a raise, and l get this.

19:22.679 --> 19:26.724
l don't know about your raise, ma'am,
but l am a huge fan of your work.

19:28.226 --> 19:30.019
<i>Journal of Forensic Sciences.</i>

19:30.228 --> 19:33.148
Deducting drop size and velocity
from circular blood stains.

19:33.481 --> 19:36.151
l did not know anyone
actually read that.

19:36.317 --> 19:37.777
Oh, yeah.

19:38.027 --> 19:41.364
Anytime l undertake a mission,
l recon the situation

19:41.573 --> 19:44.701
so l can best adapt myself
to the surroundings.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.161
Ma'am.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.875
- Okay, do me a favour, Chip?
- lt's Charles, ma'am.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.710
- Charles.
- Charles.

19:53.918 --> 19:55.462
Don't call me ma'am. lt's Abby.

19:55.712 --> 19:58.798
And can you just hang tight here
for a second?

19:59.007 --> 20:01.384
Because l need to make
a short moustache--

20:01.593 --> 20:04.679
A quick, a quick phone call.
l need to make a phone call.

20:04.929 --> 20:06.556
l'll be right back.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.020
Gibbs, l have a problem down here.

20:14.439 --> 20:18.067
- You needed to see me?
- Abby Sciuto's new assistant.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.737
Abby's overworked.
She needed help down there.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.656
You haven't been here long enough
to know what she needs yet, Jen.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.743
The girl practically
mainlines caffeine, Gibbs.

20:26.951 --> 20:30.789
The guys in the mailroom call her
Energizer Abby.

20:31.873 --> 20:33.333
She works best alone.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.919
She's a lot like you.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.587
Very hands-on.

20:42.175 --> 20:43.343
Give it a month, Jethro.

20:43.593 --> 20:46.513
lf she's still unhappy,
we'll talk about it.

20:48.556 --> 20:53.478
- You can give me a month, can't you?
- lt's not me you have to worry about.

20:53.728 --> 20:56.648
- Abby works alone for a reason.
- Which is?

20:56.898 --> 20:58.358
Something you should ask her
yourself.

20:58.608 --> 21:00.276
l will.

21:02.487 --> 21:04.864
l'm briefing SECNAV
in about an hour.

21:05.115 --> 21:06.991
Anything on the two
missing Marine wives?

21:07.242 --> 21:09.452
- Not yet.
- l need more than that, Jethro.

21:09.661 --> 21:12.205
Well, you can tell him
they were running an lnternet sex site

21:12.497 --> 21:14.916
while their husbands were deployed
and, as a result of that,

21:15.125 --> 21:16.584
they may have been murdered.

21:18.294 --> 21:21.464
l guess l can hold off briefing him
for a little while.

21:22.841 --> 21:24.008
Good call, Madam Director.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.554
Gibbs.

21:31.599 --> 21:34.352
- Chow's getting cold, McGee.
- No time.

21:34.561 --> 21:37.313
Gotta find where this Naughty Naughty
Neighbors website money went

21:37.564 --> 21:40.066
because if l don't,
Gibbs might decide to kill me this time.

21:40.859 --> 21:43.027
- He has an excellent point.
- This doesn't make sense.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.779
They made almost $500,000.

21:45.029 --> 21:47.365
- lt just can't disappear.
- Money changes hands, McGee.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.617
- Rarely does it disappear.
- Money maybe,

21:49.826 --> 21:52.203
but there are only two people
who had access to this cash,

21:52.412 --> 21:54.747
- and both of them have vanished.
- Not anymore.

21:55.832 --> 21:58.376
Dumfries Police Department
found Leanne Roberts.

22:12.790 --> 22:16.169
l'm sorry, Jethro.
There's just too many parameters.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.462
Fully clothed,
sealed in the back of a car.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.756
lt's been a pretty cool and dry week.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.218
l couldn't even give you an educated
guess as to when she died.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.469
- The wound is deep.
- Yes.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.889
Consistent with a combat
or hunting knife.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.682
Like the one on that lnternet video.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.353
Yeah, it could be.

22:34.729 --> 22:38.065
Sweep the yard. See if the dog reacts
to any other human remains.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.443
Hey, buddy.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.113
She doesn't like people.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.913
Maybe it's just me.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.082
How long is Gibbs planning
on keeping us here?

22:55.333 --> 22:58.669
As long as it takes to find
the other missing wife.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.171
Assuming she's even here, Tony.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.632
lt could take days
to search this place.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.301
Why don't you tell Gibbs that?
He loves our input.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.018
You sure these are
corpse-smelling dogs?

23:14.268 --> 23:16.854
Of course.
That's why they're alerting to McGee.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.648
He's been a dead man
since yesterday.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.608
Very funny stuff there, Tony.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.528
- Still working on it.
- How did you end up here, McGee?

23:23.736 --> 23:26.656
Well, l rode in the back of the van.
You may have noticed my screaming

23:26.822 --> 23:28.741
as Tony ran that light.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.535
Not ''here'' here.

23:30.785 --> 23:31.953
At NClS.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.956
- l know Tony's story, what's yours?
- Do you want the long version

23:35.164 --> 23:37.667
- or the short version?
- Oh, there's only one version.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.211
McGee showed up on our doorstep
like a little lost poodle.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.588
- That is not true, Ziva.
- No, you're right.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.507
lt was more like a Saint Bernard.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.593
DiNozzo. Ziva. We're out of here.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.512
- Thank you, God.
- What about me, boss?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.722
You're heading the search.
Find me that other body.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.683
Why me?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.186
l'm not the newbie anymore.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.522
Don't you think this is maybe a job
for Ziva?

24:00.106 --> 24:03.442
l need a trained investigator
running this site, McGee.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.945
Do you think Ziva fits that bill?

24:06.821 --> 24:07.947
l guess not, boss.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.203
Hey, quit feeling sorry for yourself.
Do what you do best.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.997
- What, you mean screwing up?
- No.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.748
Finding answers
where no one else can.

24:20.835 --> 24:21.836
That was nice of you.

24:22.086 --> 24:23.546
Never kick a probie
when he's down.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.883
- l thought the expression was dog.
- lt's the same difference.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.594
You've been through the wars,
my dear.

24:29.844 --> 24:33.514
Murdered in your own home and then
discarded like yesterday's rubbish.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.807
What's the time of death?

24:35.057 --> 24:38.269
Based on decomposition
and bloating, ten, 1 2 days ago.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.980
- She was killed prior to Jamie Carr.
- X-rays, doctor.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.440
Thank you.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.068
What's this translucent gel
leaking under the table?

24:46.277 --> 24:47.737
Silicone, Mr. Palmer.

24:47.945 --> 24:52.158
lt appears our young lady's
left implant ruptured.

24:52.366 --> 24:56.913
As l suspected, cause of death--
Compound fracture of the skull.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.916
My guess would have been on the
8-inch gash across her throat.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.667
Then you'd have been wrong,
Mr. Palmer.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.004
Such a gash should have resulted
in enough loss of blood

25:05.213 --> 25:07.256
that would have covered
her entire torso.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.592
- Should have, Duck?
- Yes, when l cleaned the body,

25:09.800 --> 25:11.761
there was little to no external blood.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.932
She died of blunt force trauma.
Once her brain function ceased,

25:16.182 --> 25:18.559
the cardiovascular system
shut down.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.603
Explaining the lack of blood loss.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.774
lndeed, Jethro. Leanne Roberts died

25:25.024 --> 25:28.402
and then the knife
was taken to her neck.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.281
You never cease to amaze me.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.033
l probably would have gone pro

25:34.283 --> 25:35.910
if l hadn't blown out my knee
senior year.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.038
l was referring to the numerous ways
in which you entertain yourself.

25:40.081 --> 25:43.000
- Like what?
- Computer solitaire, paper airplanes,

25:43.251 --> 25:44.961
last week's rubber-band war.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.965
Well, in all fairness,
that was McGee's fault.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.591
- How?
- He's the one who brought

25:50.758 --> 25:52.218
the rubber bands
from the supply room.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.011
Should have known better.

25:55.479 --> 25:57.022
l think he learned his lesson.

25:57.231 --> 26:01.110
l never knew a rubber band
could leave such a welt.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.320
lt's all in the release.

26:07.074 --> 26:11.954
lt's astounding you actually find
the time to do your job.

26:13.414 --> 26:17.126
- That's the creative process.
- What's that?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.879
While you were getting
your little Banana-Rama thingy,

26:20.129 --> 26:21.380
l was finding us a lead.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.007
lt's Berry Mango Madness.

26:23.799 --> 26:27.678
- And l'm listening.
- This dude had platinum membership

26:27.887 --> 26:30.347
to the website, restraining order
filed against him last year

26:30.556 --> 26:31.807
and lives in the Dumfries area.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.601
- Name?
- Robert T. Sullivan.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.811
Checked him out.
He's been in South Beach, Florida,

26:36.020 --> 26:39.398
- for the past six weeks.
- South Beach is an exotic place.

26:39.648 --> 26:42.735
Beaches, babes. Bingo.

26:43.944 --> 26:48.782
Mr. Sullivan is in a spiritual retreat.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.744
He's a Jehovah's Witness.

26:51.994 --> 26:53.621
That would explain
the restraining order.

26:53.871 --> 26:57.124
Well, only 4,338 to go.

27:06.467 --> 27:09.804
This has been the longest two days
of my life.

27:10.387 --> 27:12.264
Popcorn, Chip?

27:13.390 --> 27:15.100
- Chip, are you with us?
- Oh, yeah.

27:15.309 --> 27:17.978
Sorry, ma'am.
l guess l zoned out for a minute.

27:18.229 --> 27:20.022
lt's Abby, and it was like an hour.

27:20.231 --> 27:24.276
Look, l-- l'd feel more comfortable
being assigned to another project.

27:24.527 --> 27:26.612
What? You don't like
watching porn with me?

27:26.862 --> 27:29.365
Sorry l'm not one of the fellas,
but l'm doing the best l can.

27:29.615 --> 27:32.117
l don't really watch explicit material
with my peers, ma'am.

27:32.368 --> 27:37.123
Abby. Abby, l don't watch it at all.

27:37.373 --> 27:38.749
Not buying it, Chip.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.293
- And why is that?
- Two reasons. One, you're male.

27:41.544 --> 27:43.087
- Two, you're breathing.
- l find that

27:43.254 --> 27:44.463
to be an unfair generalisation.

27:44.672 --> 27:47.675
Not all men engage themselves
in those kinds of immoral activities.

27:47.925 --> 27:50.845
- That's not what Tony says.
- Yeah, well.

27:51.095 --> 27:53.264
l prefer to spend my time
more constructively.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.308
l have a detailed routine designed
to strengthen my mind and my body.

27:56.517 --> 27:59.353
l do callisthenics in the morning,
and l do brain teasers at night.

27:59.562 --> 28:01.313
- Home-schooled.
- How did you know?

28:01.564 --> 28:05.234
Wild guess. Oh, look at that, Chip.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.237
Oh, yes. Video's done.
We're done.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.490
Nope.
That was just Jamie Carr's feed.

28:15.578 --> 28:17.746
Now it's Leanne Roberts'.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.376
Fantastic.

28:30.593 --> 28:32.928
Having problems, Officer David?

28:33.179 --> 28:35.014
At Mossad, we used Mac.

28:35.264 --> 28:37.308
l'm yet not accustomed
to this operating system.

28:38.309 --> 28:41.061
lt's like l've told Gibbs,
that approach never works, Ziva.

28:41.312 --> 28:44.190
My approach makes me feel better.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.691
You found Jamie Carr's body?

28:45.941 --> 28:49.487
Negative. The police and MPs
are continuing the search tomorrow.

28:49.737 --> 28:51.113
We haven't had much luck either.

28:51.363 --> 28:54.366
Most of the subscribers for Naughty
Naughty Neighbors are out of state.

28:54.617 --> 28:55.784
l didn't say l had no luck.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.246
About an hour ago, l found my ticket
back to the land of the living.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.166
Buried under scrap metal
about 50 feet

29:02.374 --> 29:04.251
from where we found
Leanne Roberts' body.

29:04.502 --> 29:05.961
Where's Gibbs?

29:06.170 --> 29:09.590
<i>l want you to understand, ma'am,
Sergeant Roberts is a good man.</i>

29:09.840 --> 29:13.469
Understood, captain, but my people
still need to talk to him about his wife.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.305
<i>l'd like them to do more
than just talk, ma'am.</i>

29:16.555 --> 29:18.599
<i>- They have to stop him.
- From doing what, captain?</i>

29:18.849 --> 29:20.559
<i>From ruining his life, sir.</i>

29:20.768 --> 29:23.938
<i>My sergeant major told me
to contact you, Special Agent Gibbs.</i>

29:24.188 --> 29:27.566
<i>Sergeant Roberts requested
emergency leave two days ago.</i>

29:27.817 --> 29:29.902
We just found his wife's body.
How's that possible?

29:30.152 --> 29:32.488
<i>He doesn't know she's dead yet, sir.</i>

29:32.738 --> 29:34.907
<i>He requested leave
for another reason.</i>

29:35.157 --> 29:37.451
<i>- Which was?
- A personal matter, ma'am.</i>

29:37.701 --> 29:39.578
We know about the sex site,
captain.

29:39.829 --> 29:41.831
<i>Well, then you should know
that Sergeant Roberts</i>

29:42.081 --> 29:44.083
<i>blames one of his neighbours for it.</i>

29:44.291 --> 29:47.336
<i>According to his squad,
he's planning on killing the man.</i>

29:47.586 --> 29:49.755
And you sent him home to do it,
captain?

29:50.005 --> 29:53.008
<i>l was unaware of his intentions
until this morning, ma'am.</i>

29:53.217 --> 29:55.344
<i>Look, l just need your help.</i>

29:55.594 --> 29:58.889
<i>Now, the neighbour's name
is Bart Powell.</i>

29:59.140 --> 30:00.766
When's the sergeant scheduled
to land?

30:00.975 --> 30:03.561
<i>- Tomorrow, sir.
- Check his flight manifest.</i>

30:03.811 --> 30:06.272
<i>He just needs a cool-down period,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

30:06.522 --> 30:09.608
<i>And like l said, he's a good man,
and an even better Marine.</i>

30:09.817 --> 30:11.902
We're on it.
We'll pick him up at the airport.

30:12.153 --> 30:15.865
<i>Thank you, sir. My sergeant major
said that we could count on you.</i>

30:17.408 --> 30:20.077
<i>- He get that bottle l sent him?
- He did.</i>

30:20.327 --> 30:23.831
<i>He told me to tell you
to keep them coming.</i>

30:25.291 --> 30:27.334
Alcohol is contraband in lraq.

30:28.252 --> 30:31.130
- l thought it'd take longer, Jen.
- Longer for what?

30:31.797 --> 30:34.884
For me to see you as a director
and not a field agent.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.930
Ma'am, Sergeant Roberts
changed his itinerary.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.932
He left West Germany last night.

30:42.183 --> 30:44.768
- When's he due in?
- He arrived two hours ago at Dulles.

30:52.860 --> 30:55.279
We're here to stop Sergeant Roberts,
not kill him.

30:55.529 --> 30:58.115
- But what if--?
- l said, stop him, Officer David.

30:58.365 --> 30:59.825
Got it.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.785
You take the right.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.663
- l didn't do anything.
- Where is she?

31:07.833 --> 31:09.126
- Where's my wife?
- l don't know.

31:09.376 --> 31:11.921
- Where's my wife?
- l don't know. l swear.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.423
She told me what you made her do.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.427
l'm going to gut you
like the pig you are.

31:22.306 --> 31:25.768
Drop the knife, sergeant.
Special Agent Gibbs, NClS.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.394
We'll take it from here.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.607
- Do you know what he did to my wife?
- l do.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.360
- We're here to take him into custody.
- He deserves to die.

31:34.610 --> 31:36.195
l can't let you do that, sergeant.

31:41.617 --> 31:43.202
Sergeant.

31:44.829 --> 31:49.583
My house. There was police tape,
blood inside.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.377
Leanne's dead, isn't she?

31:52.336 --> 31:54.046
l'm sorry, Marine.

31:59.927 --> 32:00.928
You killed her.

32:09.812 --> 32:11.730
What now, sir?

32:12.481 --> 32:14.525
What am l supposed to do now?

32:17.444 --> 32:19.238
l did not kill Leanne Roberts.

32:19.488 --> 32:22.867
This is-- This is insane.
l barely knew her.

32:23.951 --> 32:25.578
He wants you to run the tape.

32:27.121 --> 32:30.374
- l guess it was worth it, then.
- Worth what?

32:30.624 --> 32:34.086
Watching over 20 hours
of porn with Chip.

32:34.462 --> 32:36.672
- Who the hell is Chip?
- Her new assistant.

32:36.922 --> 32:41.343
- That l didn't ask for, Madam Director.
- Abby, it's director or ma'am,

32:41.594 --> 32:42.595
not madam.

32:42.845 --> 32:44.763
How is Mr. Sterling working out?

32:45.014 --> 32:47.099
All l can tell you right now, ma'am,

32:47.349 --> 32:49.518
is that he's easily excitable.

32:53.647 --> 32:55.107
Barely knew her?

32:55.316 --> 32:57.902
All l see is some shadow
climbing through her window.

32:58.652 --> 33:00.946
What do you see now?

33:04.992 --> 33:08.621
Okay, so we had an affair.
l mean, that's not a crime.

33:08.871 --> 33:11.791
But you know what is? Blackmail.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.920
Sergeant Roberts got a letter in lraq
last week from his wife

33:16.170 --> 33:18.631
- explaining everything.
- About what?

33:18.881 --> 33:21.467
You found out about her website.
Threatened to tell her husband

33:21.675 --> 33:23.761
- unless she'd sleep with you.
- Oh, God. No. No.

33:23.969 --> 33:26.013
l wouldn't have.
l was just fooling around.

33:26.222 --> 33:28.974
You killed her and you killed her
website partner, Jamie Carr.

33:29.183 --> 33:32.603
- No, l didn't kill anyone.
- You're a liar and you're a predator.

33:32.853 --> 33:36.106
And you think anybody is gonna
believe what you have to say now?

33:41.987 --> 33:45.074
lt's been a while since l've seen
you in interrogation, Jethro.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.450
You haven't lost your touch.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.536
l should've let Sergeant Roberts
kill him.

33:48.786 --> 33:52.081
Bad news, boss. Hi.
Powell's alibi checked out.

33:52.289 --> 33:55.042
The week Leanne Roberts was
murdered, he was at Disney World.

33:55.292 --> 33:56.919
Did you tell Sergeant Roberts yet?

33:57.128 --> 34:00.005
l thought it would be best
if it came from a fellow Marine.

34:00.256 --> 34:01.632
So if Powell didn't do it, who did?

34:01.841 --> 34:04.260
That's what we're going to find out,
Agent DiNozzo.

34:20.442 --> 34:21.819
Running a little late this morning?

34:22.027 --> 34:24.864
Stopped at the mall to pick up Monica's
gift. lt was completely packed.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.366
Scott Baio's cutting the ribbon
at a new Pottery Barn.

34:27.574 --> 34:29.118
- Who's Scott Baio?
- Exactly.

34:29.717 --> 34:30.719
Morning, probie.

34:33.096 --> 34:35.181
- What's with him?
- He's been that way all morning.

34:35.431 --> 34:37.559
l do not believe he went home
last night.

34:38.893 --> 34:41.897
- Where's Gibbs?
- He left for coffee.

34:44.608 --> 34:46.400
What do you think?

34:46.610 --> 34:47.902
lt's not your colour, DiNozzo.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.987
- l was just showing Ziva--
- You're late.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.658
Yeah, l had to run an errand.
lt was important but--

34:52.908 --> 34:55.409
- lt won't happen again.
- Boss, l located the money.

34:57.204 --> 35:00.374
A Cayman account set up to put into a
U.S. account on the 1 5th each month.

35:00.624 --> 35:02.918
- Whose account?
- Her name is Hazel Davenport.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.504
- We got an address?
- Royal Manor Retirement Home.

35:05.712 --> 35:09.258
She's 86 years old, happens to be the
maternal grandmother of Carter Finch.

35:09.466 --> 35:11.510
See what happens when
you show up to work on time?

35:11.760 --> 35:13.595
He emptied the account last night

35:13.887 --> 35:16.431
and walked out with close
to half a mil in cash.

35:17.057 --> 35:18.767
What are you waiting for?

35:18.976 --> 35:20.936
Bring me Finch.

35:23.438 --> 35:25.607
- Now.
- Right.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.025
You pulled an all-nighter?

35:27.276 --> 35:30.737
- Sergeant Roberts deserves answers.
- Should've told me. l would've stayed.

35:30.988 --> 35:32.614
l know you would've.
So why were you late?

35:32.865 --> 35:35.117
Stopped by the mall to pick up
Monica's birthday present.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.786
Did you see Scott Baio?

35:39.246 --> 35:40.873
Not the knife in the video, Chip.

35:41.081 --> 35:42.082
How do you know for sure?

35:44.126 --> 35:46.461
Because it's obvious.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.137
See the butt of the knife?

35:55.888 --> 35:58.640
Not the same.
This is a Marine KA-BAR.

35:58.932 --> 36:00.559
See the blade?

36:00.809 --> 36:02.352
- Not the same?
- Not the same, Chip.

36:02.603 --> 36:03.979
There are no serrations.

36:04.188 --> 36:08.150
A different knife killed Leanne Roberts
than killed Jamie Carr.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.652
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Doesn't make any sense.

36:10.944 --> 36:14.823
- Good, Chip.
- l really hate being called Chip.

36:15.032 --> 36:17.367
l really hate that Ozzie got fat
and stupid. Live with it.

36:18.535 --> 36:20.746
Now here is what really
doesn't make sense.

36:20.996 --> 36:24.625
Hunting knives, kitchen knives,
military knives, ceremonial knives.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.835
Four hundred and twenty-three
different kinds.

36:27.044 --> 36:28.420
And none of them match this one.

36:30.714 --> 36:32.633
- That's strange.
- Wrong response, Chip.

36:33.717 --> 36:36.261
Nothing matches yet.

36:36.512 --> 36:37.805
Now you're making sense.

36:40.724 --> 36:41.975
Laptop's gone.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.353
- Left in a hurry, boss.
- Did you talk to his mother?

36:44.561 --> 36:46.688
Said that she hasn't seen him
since we talked to him.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.023
Tony and Ziva spooked him.

36:48.232 --> 36:50.692
You want to set up surveillance,
make sure when he comes back?

36:50.984 --> 36:53.403
He's not coming back.

36:54.029 --> 36:55.322
<i>l checked his cell-phone records.</i>

36:55.572 --> 36:59.159
He's not made or received a phone call
since Wednesday of last week.

36:59.409 --> 37:01.328
l can't imagine
he has a lot of friends.

37:01.537 --> 37:04.540
He doesn't need them, considering
he has half a million dollars in cash.

37:04.832 --> 37:07.501
That he picked up
over 1 8 hours ago.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.837
l could be in Rio de Janeiro
right now.

37:10.087 --> 37:11.338
Good thing he's not you.

37:13.715 --> 37:16.051
Okay, this guy's not smart enough
to cover his tracks.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.719
He's done pretty well so far.

37:17.970 --> 37:22.224
He does online auctions
from his laptop.

37:22.516 --> 37:25.686
- Super Collectibles.
- UltraCollectiblesandAuctions.com.

37:26.979 --> 37:29.314
- Can we trace him?
- lf we can pinpoint some of his items.

37:29.565 --> 37:31.483
<i>- Do you know what he sells?
- Star Wars stuff.</i>

37:31.733 --> 37:33.735
That narrows it down to, like,
50 million people.

37:35.529 --> 37:37.072
Some kind of figurine.

37:37.281 --> 37:38.740
- There's only three of them.
- Yoda?

37:38.991 --> 37:40.909
C-3PO? Stormtrooper?

37:41.118 --> 37:44.580
Wookiee. There's a special edition
prototype from 1 978.

37:44.788 --> 37:46.999
lt's equipped with an ammo belt.
There are only three.

37:47.249 --> 37:49.084
<i>- You're a Star Wars junky.
- Not especially.</i>

37:49.376 --> 37:50.961
She has a photographic memory,
probie.

37:51.211 --> 37:52.421
Not a social disorder.

37:52.629 --> 37:55.757
Okay, there is one '78
Wookiee posted.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.384
Only one with an ammo belt.

37:58.802 --> 38:01.263
- High bid was over $1 ,200.
- Was?

38:01.513 --> 38:03.265
He shut down the auction
early this morning.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.058
Guess he no longer needed
the cash.

38:05.309 --> 38:07.436
- Can you find him?
- l'm tracing the host-computer

38:07.644 --> 38:09.605
lP address now.

38:09.813 --> 38:12.191
Looks like he last logged on
six hours ago.

38:12.399 --> 38:15.068
Broadband connection at the
Freemont lnn in Woodbridge, Virginia.

38:15.235 --> 38:18.947
That's 20 minutes from here. Ziva,
you're with me. McGee, call Gibbs.

38:20.157 --> 38:23.118
lf things get hairy,
just follow my lead.

38:24.077 --> 38:25.537
- Ladies?
- l don't need a babysitter.

38:25.787 --> 38:27.414
l've been in hundreds
of these situations.

38:27.623 --> 38:30.000
Never with me. As far
as l'm concerned, you're a probie.

38:30.250 --> 38:32.920
l've never had sex with you either.
Does that mean l'm a virgin?

38:33.128 --> 38:35.297
Trust is a virtue that's earned,
not given.

38:35.589 --> 38:38.091
- Profound.
- l try.

38:41.595 --> 38:43.806
- Nice ass, yes?
- Something like that.

38:45.307 --> 38:46.433
Federal agents.

38:47.017 --> 38:48.477
Looks like we missed quite a party.

38:55.651 --> 38:57.444
l think you want
to take a look at this.

39:08.705 --> 39:10.916
The knife's a KA-BAR,
a Marine fighting knife.

39:11.166 --> 39:14.086
l told Gibbs not to let Sergeant Roberts
go home last night.

39:14.336 --> 39:15.796
What do you think of that? Blood?

39:18.215 --> 39:19.591
Do you smell that?

39:19.800 --> 39:21.343
Haviar Christian Number Five.

39:23.053 --> 39:24.847
You think you're the only one
with a memory?

39:26.598 --> 39:28.058
That's not blood.

39:30.394 --> 39:32.855
lt's hair dye.

39:39.486 --> 39:41.196
- Have you seen Gibbs?
- Gibbs, it's Abby.

39:41.363 --> 39:44.575
l need to talk to you, pronto.
Now you may speak, McGee.

39:44.825 --> 39:47.161
- Do you know where Gibbs is?
- He was with the director.

39:47.411 --> 39:49.538
- l really need to talk to him.
- Not as much as l do.

39:49.746 --> 39:51.456
He better have a reason
for not answering--

39:51.665 --> 39:53.709
How's briefing
the secretary of the navy, McGee?

39:53.917 --> 39:56.753
- Does that one work for you?
- Sorry. lt's just that we found Carter.

39:57.004 --> 39:58.714
Tony and Ziva
are probably there now.

39:58.922 --> 40:00.215
- Where?
- The Freemont lnn.

40:00.424 --> 40:01.884
- Gibbs?
- Get DiNozzo on the phone.

40:02.134 --> 40:03.719
- Now.
- Right.

40:04.386 --> 40:07.890
Gibbs.
l can't work like this anymore.

40:12.436 --> 40:14.730
The knife? lt's fake.

40:14.938 --> 40:18.066
Two hundred and forty-three dollars
at your local magic shop.

40:19.026 --> 40:20.986
Jamie Carr...

40:25.949 --> 40:26.950
...faked her own death.

40:32.789 --> 40:35.125
Jamie Carr?
l liked you better as a blond.

40:36.585 --> 40:38.670
That is probably not a good idea.

40:43.217 --> 40:46.720
- You're probably familiar with these.
- You wish.

40:56.104 --> 40:57.481
<i>- DiNozzo.
- The knife in the video</i>

40:57.648 --> 41:00.400
<i>- is a fake, DiNozzo. Jamie Carr is--
- Alive.</i>

41:00.609 --> 41:01.777
We're looking at her right now.

41:01.985 --> 41:03.445
<i>- What about Carter--?
- Finch? Dead.</i>

41:03.695 --> 41:06.031
<i>She offed him in the hotel room,
took all the money.</i>

41:06.281 --> 41:09.284
She's a naughty little kitty cat.
Anything else, boss?

41:11.495 --> 41:13.914
Now you know how l feel, Gibbs.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.169
She claims it was an accident.

41:19.586 --> 41:22.130
They fought
when your wife wanted out,

41:22.339 --> 41:24.800
tell you about the lnternet site.

41:26.301 --> 41:28.095
lt's my fault.

41:28.428 --> 41:31.640
- l was away for too damn long, sir.
- Trust me.

41:31.849 --> 41:34.977
Marine, none of this is your fault.

41:41.942 --> 41:43.735
Leanne wanted to start a family.

41:44.528 --> 41:45.988
l told her we couldn't afford it.

41:46.655 --> 41:48.949
Maybe when l made staff sergeant,
you know?

41:51.994 --> 41:53.370
l never thought that she'd--

41:54.663 --> 41:56.331
l know exactly how you feel.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.668
How do you--?

42:02.171 --> 42:04.006
How do you live with it, sir?

42:05.883 --> 42:10.804
You ask yourself that question
every day until you find the answer.

42:12.556 --> 42:14.475
And what did you find, sir?

42:26.737 --> 42:30.199
- How did Sergeant Roberts take it?
- He's on his way back to lraq.

42:30.407 --> 42:32.034
You think that's wise,
sending a Marine

42:32.242 --> 42:34.161
who just lost his wife
back into combat?

42:34.912 --> 42:37.372
Wise? No, but it's what l'd do.

42:38.415 --> 42:40.042
- Are you heading out?
- Yeah.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.753
Good. l'll walk you to your car.

42:53.096 --> 42:57.392
Tony, it's almost 9:00.
lsn't tonight your big birthday dinner?

43:00.187 --> 43:02.189
- We broke up.
- Why?

43:02.439 --> 43:05.025
Apparently, her husband didn't think
it was a good idea.

43:05.275 --> 43:07.236
She's married?

43:07.444 --> 43:09.238
Knew she was too good to be true.

43:13.075 --> 43:15.160
Do you still have
those dinner reservations?

43:16.745 --> 43:17.746
My treat.

43:22.835 --> 43:25.587
l guess l could drown my sorrows
in surf and turf.

43:25.796 --> 43:26.922
That's a good attitude.

43:28.549 --> 43:30.259
l'll catch up.

43:31.301 --> 43:32.427
You will not be needing that.
