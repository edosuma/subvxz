so just call me directly
if anything else comes up.

25:47.548 --> 25:48.757
Thank you.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.804
Here's what I've been able to find out.
They're moving Franny to a private home.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.223
-She has a home.
-They're a highly regarded family,

25:56.306 --> 25:58.642
they've got two kids of their own,
one is close to Franny's age.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.562
-It'll be like a sleepover.
-With people she doesn't know.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.688
What are they telling her?

26:02.771 --> 26:05.482
-She must be freaking out.
-It's one night, Carrie.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.860
We're scheduled to be in court
tomorrow afternoon.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.779
I can't just sit here
and allow this to happen.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.281
You've got no choice.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.367
Look at it this way.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.619
Franny has been through
something terrifying.

26:17.703 --> 26:19.997
The caseworkers are just doing
what they're supposed to do,

26:20.080 --> 26:21.623
protecting the child in question.

26:21.707 --> 26:23.792
Franny doesn't need their protection.

26:23.876 --> 26:26.461
And when the judge realizes that tomorrow,
he'll send her home.

31:03.322 --> 31:04.990
CHRISTINE: (IN ENGLISH) For the most part,

31:05.073 --> 31:07.743
Ms. Mathison is an involved,
concerned parent.

31:07.826 --> 31:10.287
Recently she moved to Brooklyn
and started a new career

31:10.370 --> 31:14.708
in effort to become a more consistent
presence in Franny's life.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.752
However, I found
that Ms. Mathison's efforts

31:16.835 --> 31:18.545
to provide a stable environment for Franny

31:18.629 --> 31:22.007
have been undermined by some blind spots.

31:23.008 --> 31:26.094
For example, she brought
a mentally disturbed veteran,

31:26.178 --> 31:27.721
Peter Quinn, into her home.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.224
I... I thought I explained that.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.393
This led to an incident
in which Mr. Quinn held Franny

31:33.477 --> 31:35.604
and her nanny hostage for several hours.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.606
I described it in detail in my report.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.024
I've read it.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.318
Your Honor,
Quinn thought he was protecting Franny.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.904
You'll have your chance
to address the court, Ms. Mathison.

31:43.987 --> 31:47.115
I'm sorry, but you should know
that Quinn is no longer living in my home.

31:47.199 --> 31:48.742
It's an important point, Your Honor.

31:48.825 --> 31:51.370
If the main issue
is Franny's exposure to Mr. Quinn,

31:51.453 --> 31:52.788
that problem has been resolved.

31:52.871 --> 31:55.207
Your Honor, even with Mr. Quinn
removed from the home,

31:55.290 --> 31:57.084
Franny continues to be at risk.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.168
From whom?

31:58.710 --> 32:00.587
Well, from her mother.

32:00.671 --> 32:03.549
This morning I conducted
my second interview with Franny.

32:03.632 --> 32:08.303
In this conversation
she disclosed a disturbing fact.

32:08.387 --> 32:11.557
Two nights ago, she woke up
and discovered her mother in her room.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.891
So?

32:13.517 --> 32:17.396
Ms. Mathison was sitting on the floor
near Franny's bed, asleep

32:17.479 --> 32:19.273
with a gun in her lap.

32:22.484 --> 32:24.403
JUDGE: Ms. Mathison, is that true?

32:27.656 --> 32:28.824

32:29.783 --> 32:32.035
I did have a gun, but I was not asleep.

32:32.119 --> 32:33.787
That's not what her daughter said.

32:34.955 --> 32:36.790
Was the gun loaded, Ms. Mathison?

32:43.213 --> 32:44.506
Answer the question.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.010
Yes, it was.

32:50.637 --> 32:53.557
Putting aside for a moment
whether or not you were asleep,

32:53.640 --> 32:57.311
can you explain what you were doing
in your daughter's room with a loaded gun?

32:58.353 --> 33:01.190
I had reason to fear for my safety,
Your Honor, and Franny's.

33:01.273 --> 33:02.858
Why didn't you call the police?

33:06.653 --> 33:11.116
If you felt you were in danger,
why not call the police?

33:12.701 --> 33:13.994
(SIGHS)

33:14.077 --> 33:16.747
Your Honor,
I'm a former intelligence officer.

33:16.830 --> 33:18.290
I used to work for the CIA.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.459
Go on.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.922
I've been trained to handle firearms
and deal with threatening situations.

33:25.005 --> 33:27.257
Lately, at my home, there have been times

33:27.341 --> 33:29.301
when I've felt that Franny and I
were in danger.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.554
So, I responded in the way
that I was trained.

33:32.638 --> 33:35.849
By spending the night
next to your daughter with a loaded gun?

33:35.933 --> 33:37.100
Uh... The safety was on.

33:37.184 --> 33:38.769
But the gun was loaded.

33:38.852 --> 33:42.022
Your daughter is sleeping a few feet away.
Do you think that's reasonable?

33:43.190 --> 33:45.734
Two days before,
I had people out on the street

33:45.817 --> 33:48.320
throwing rocks at my house,
calling me a terrorist.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.781
Aren't the police prepared
to handle a situation like that?

33:50.864 --> 33:52.533
Well, the last time
the police came to my house,

33:52.616 --> 33:54.243
things didn't turn out so well.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.870
So, you're saying
you can handle a dangerous situation

33:56.954 --> 33:58.372
better than the police?

33:59.790 --> 34:02.334
No. No, I... I do not mean that.

34:02.417 --> 34:06.088
I mean, I have worked
in tense environments,

34:06.171 --> 34:08.090
in Baghdad, in Islamabad.

34:08.173 --> 34:11.552
I don't panic in dangerous situations.
I can keep my head clear.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.680
But, in terms of my home,

34:14.763 --> 34:17.641
the demonstrators haven't come back,
so that danger has passed,

34:17.724 --> 34:19.601
and Quinn is no longer
living in the house.

34:19.685 --> 34:23.230
So, I'm confident that Franny
will be safe at home with me.

34:24.940 --> 34:26.316
CHRISTINE: Your Honor.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.237
Ms. Mathison's neglected
to tell the court an important fact.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.363
Go on.

34:31.446 --> 34:33.574
She suffers from bipolar disorder.

34:33.657 --> 34:35.158
-What?
-That is out of line.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.535
Is this true?

34:37.828 --> 34:41.707
Yes, but I take medication.
I haven't had an episode in over a year.

34:41.790 --> 34:44.418
She's been hospitalized
for her disorder twice,

34:44.501 --> 34:46.461
and received electro-convulsive therapy.

34:46.545 --> 34:49.756
Your Honor, depriving a parent of her
custodial rights because of an illness

34:49.840 --> 34:51.717
is blatant discrimination!

34:51.800 --> 34:54.344
Not if the illness endangers the child.

34:54.428 --> 34:58.015
And Ms. Mathison's claims
about mysterious threats

34:58.098 --> 35:01.852
and distrust of the police sound exactly
like symptoms of a manic episode.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.813
There were threats.
They had nothing to do with my illness.

35:04.897 --> 35:06.148
Quiet, please.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.071
What is the agency's recommendation?

35:13.614 --> 35:14.865
Bottom line, Your Honor,

35:14.948 --> 35:17.159
Ms. Mathison fell asleep
in her daughter's bedroom

35:17.242 --> 35:18.619
with a loaded gun.

35:18.702 --> 35:21.246
Our assessment is that this fact alone

35:21.330 --> 35:23.749
meets the legal requirement
of imminent risk.

35:27.461 --> 35:29.671
I'm going to accept
the agency's recommendation.

35:29.755 --> 35:33.592
Ms. Mathison, you'll be required
to undergo psychiatric evaluation.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.053
Ms. Lonas,

35:36.136 --> 35:39.973
I'd like you to prepare a home study
and a deeper background investigation.

35:40.057 --> 35:41.099
Yes, Your Honor.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.644

What I know, which isn't much.

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea,
me coming.

You being here is going to make
all the difference, trust me.

until you can look after yourself.

44:00.599 --> 44:01.600
No.

44:02.643 --> 44:04.978
The alternative is prison
or the psych ward.

That's the truth, Peter.

44:11.777 --> 44:13.445
Isn't this what you always dreamed of?

44:13.529 --> 44:16.907
A house on a lake.
Or do I have that wrong, too?

44:16.990 --> 44:19.076
Why don't you just put me in a fucking...

-Collar! Thank you!

you were talking about the attack.

Of your medical ordeal there.

45:33.317 --> 45:35.194
Yeah, I did. Carrie told me.

45:35.277 --> 45:36.320
What'd she say?

45:38.155 --> 45:39.281

She did this despite repeated warnings
about the risks of the procedure.

She thought you might have information
on the terror cell

on Hauptbahnhof.

She was wrong.

46:21.198 --> 46:22.324
What risks?

46:23.450 --> 46:26.578
The main one
was massive cerebral hemorrhage.

46:27.454 --> 46:28.747
Stroke.

46:32.292 --> 46:35.754
You think she's been taking care of you
all these months out of love?

46:37.047 --> 46:39.967
Sounds a lot more like guilt
if you ask me.

46:43.053 --> 46:45.305
