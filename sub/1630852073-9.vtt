00:01.067 --> 00:02.668
<i>Previously on 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:02.670 --> 00:04.303
Today is Tammy's 35th birthday

00:04.305 --> 00:06.305
<i>We wanna do something special
for her.</i>

00:06.307 --> 00:07.473
[cheering]

00:07.475 --> 00:09.174
I'm vibing.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.411
Such a blessing and we are so
grateful that she made it to 35.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.980
[cheering]

00:14.982 --> 00:16.482
[beeping]

00:16.484 --> 00:19.118
I'm here for an appointment
with Dr. Smith.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.454
Chris, you have any ideas?

00:34.134 --> 00:36.301
<i>Can you all believe we're
going on a vacation together?</i>

00:46.012 --> 00:46.845
[laughs]

00:49.949 --> 00:52.084
I'm excited to be here
at the cabin,

00:52.086 --> 00:55.154
<i>but yeah, it's late,
and it's been a long ride.</i>

00:55.855 --> 00:57.256
So, you wanna try to walk in?

01:00.760 --> 01:01.960
[bleep]

01:12.005 --> 01:13.238
<i>[Amanda] What's wrong, Tam?</i>

01:13.273 --> 01:14.940
[whimpering]

01:16.076 --> 01:17.209
What's up, sis?

01:20.113 --> 01:21.346
Hey...

01:21.915 --> 01:23.182
Hey, listen.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.351
There's no reason
to be upset, sis.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.054
[sniffles]

01:29.056 --> 01:30.022
[whimpering]

01:32.959 --> 01:34.259
- Well, we are home for the week.
<i>- No.</i>

01:34.261 --> 01:36.095
We're gonna be...
Yes, we are.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.904
<i>[Amy] The cabin was supposed to be
like six and a half hours away from home.</i>

01:45.906 --> 01:48.073
It turned into 12 hours.

01:48.075 --> 01:53.011
From all the bathroom breaks,
and my car overheated.

01:54.914 --> 01:58.750
But Tammy is throwing
a temper tantrum.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.987
<i>[Amy] I think she's good
with the ramps.</i>

02:01.989 --> 02:04.990
[Misty] You know, the faster we get this
done, the faster we get to go to bed, right?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.427
[sobbing]

02:12.665 --> 02:13.932
Amanda'll be in front of you,

02:13.934 --> 02:15.501
and I'll be behind you.
We'll get you there.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.136
We're all gonna be right here.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.937
We're all on this together.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.044
- Tammy, you were just as excited as the rest of us.
- No, I wasn't.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.947
You weren't?

02:28.949 --> 02:32.151
You acted like you're so damn excited, but
then you talk to me like you lost your mind.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.185
- Um-mm...
- Yeah, you did.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.953
Y'all did.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.388
Tammy, stop acting like that.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.656
You gonna shut up?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.825
- No, you gonna stop being rude to people.
- Leave me alone.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.828
You gonna shut [bleep] you having issues
doesn't give you the right to talk to people

02:42.830 --> 02:44.329
like you've lost your
[bleep] mind.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.933
- It costs you nothing to be kind to people, Tammy.
- Stop talking to me.

02:47.935 --> 02:52.004
All these people here are here to
support you, and you wanna act like that.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.472
- You don't [bleep] mind.
- Shut the [bleep] up.

02:53.474 --> 02:57.042
[Amanda] No, you don't lost your
damn mind. You don't talk to me like that.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.814
- You don't ask Amanda cause we're going home tonight.
- You won't get out of my face.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.984
-I'm not in your face. I'm just standing and talking.
-Leave me alone.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.454
[chuckles] Will you better go
get your damn sister?

03:12.592 --> 03:14.393
What are we gonna do
about Tammy, guys?

03:14.395 --> 03:17.629
She is just afraid to come up
the ramps, and I understand that.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.699
You know, I'm not saying that
she's wrong for feeling what she feels.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.668
She's wrong for the way
she talks to people.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.069
And I'm not gonna go back out
there and talk to her.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.605
She's gonna
make this situation worse.

03:26.607 --> 03:30.876
I love Tammy, but she doesn't know
how to communicate with people properly.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.978
- And we don't wanna mess with her.
- And then we react...

03:32.980 --> 03:35.847
Instead of just keeping in
the back of our mind that,

03:35.849 --> 03:38.283
you know, she's going through
some [bleep] right now.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.989
Yeah, but I figured
it'd take a day or two.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.327
You act like you're the only
one that's ever took care of her.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.229
Every single one of us
in this room has.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.164
[bleep]

03:52.166 --> 03:55.033
No, don't talk to her
like she do with me.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.036
I'm not playing.
I'm not leaving.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.205
I don't wanna leave either.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.679
<i>[Chris] I understand
she was tired.</i>

04:07.681 --> 04:09.014
<i>You're scared.</i>

04:09.282 --> 04:10.983
She wouldn't even
give it a chance.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.217
She wouldn't try.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.853
[sighs]

04:14.855 --> 04:17.122
We need to stand our ground,
and go there and tell her.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.058
This is our home for
the next week.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.493
Get the hell out
and get to moving.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.195
[Chris] Off we go.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.300
He need to come on
and try her to come in.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.037
What do you plan on doing
tonight?

04:35.642 --> 04:36.742
Sure.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.011
- Sis, don't be like that.
- Leave me alone.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.679
Oh, come in for a game.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.481
He wanted to go with you.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.549
Look at him looking at you.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.819
For this is our first trip,
Aunt Tammy.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.355
- You're missing out on a lot
just... [bleep] - I don't give a [bleep].

04:51.157 --> 04:52.658
I really don't feel good,

04:52.660 --> 04:54.893
And I didn't wanna come.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.296
Okay. Well, you don't feel
good, so let's get in the house--

05:13.746 --> 05:16.748
Tammy, there are other people
that are here.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.384
- And there's no reason to be like that.
- And it's late at night.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.219
I'm not going to the hospital.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.723
I want all of y'all to get
out of my [bleep] face.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.758
We just want you to go in.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.260
I don't want to go in.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.030
I'm not an animal.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.332
Y'all don't have to watch me.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.100
Bye.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.435
[clicks]

05:42.675 --> 05:44.943
[Amy] This is ridiculous.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.386
She wants to sleep in the car,
let her.

06:08.234 --> 06:09.534
I don't know.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.269
So let her sleep in the van.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.278
- Nobody. That's the whole point.
- I ain't going nowhere.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.982
Do you know where I'm going? I'm taking
my ass up those stairs with my stuff,

06:23.984 --> 06:26.151
I'm gonna get in the bed. I've
been up. I haven't slept well.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.686
I am tired.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.488
Nobody wants to live with Tammy.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.690
So it has to be shoved off
on me.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.725
Michael, would you be willing
to drive the freaking van,

06:33.727 --> 06:36.061
and then go take Tammy to
a hotel some miles away?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.798
Christopher, Michael's gonna
take her.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.067
Of course, me and Michael,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.939
All right, Tammy, I was able
to get you a hotel room.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.641
Michael's gonna take you.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.410
And we'll figure things out
in the morning.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.221
Slide on back in there
so I can shut the door.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.425
Ow.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.960
- You all right?
- Yeah.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.418
But, she could have got up
there with no problem.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.066
[country music playing]

07:50.069 --> 07:51.203
[laughs]

07:53.039 --> 07:54.039
[laughing]

07:54.041 --> 07:55.907
How are you, sugar?

07:55.909 --> 07:59.211
I'm gonna eat this banana,
we'll get it real quick.

07:59.213 --> 08:03.315
Me and Misty, we were up
rather late last night. We just kept

08:03.317 --> 08:07.085
replaying the scenario in our head, last
night, about what happened with Tammy.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.868
Well, this is just really a [bleep] start
to what could have been an awesome vacation.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.636
<i>And you know, all of us
siblings were here last night,</i>

08:24.638 --> 08:26.471
<i>running through the whole thing,</i>

08:26.473 --> 08:28.840
what could we have done differently
to make the outcome different,

08:28.842 --> 08:31.009
<i>but we all just came to an
agreement that</i>

08:31.011 --> 08:33.211
<i>we couldn't have done anything
better than what we did.</i>

08:36.082 --> 08:37.082
Not it.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.050
It ain't gonna be me.

08:40.786 --> 08:41.453
Me, neither.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.155
Leave her in her room.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.258
Hold on, wait a minute.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.260
You know my friend, Rob?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.961
He might be willing to come
up here and get her ass.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.163
And he can also push her.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.634
Yeah, he's strong enough,
he can push her.

08:55.636 --> 09:00.639
We have a family friend, he
does a lot for everybody, you know.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.807
If we need something,
he's always there.

09:02.809 --> 09:06.811
So I'm sure if we can call
him, he'll come and get Tammy.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.915
What else on the agenda, then,
as far as the attractions

09:09.917 --> 09:12.951
or whatever that we're gonna go do,
what kind of shoes do I need to wear?

09:19.926 --> 09:21.459
That's cool.

09:25.231 --> 09:29.334
I mean, I'm not real happy with her but
we can be mad when we get to Kentucky.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.469
We've always
put differences aside.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.472
Just because we're down here on
vacation doesn't mean we can't do that.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.541
We need to send the invites
and say "hey".

09:36.543 --> 09:39.778
Maybe you were not here, things
went down the way it did last night.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.212
You know, we still want
you to come, you know

09:41.214 --> 09:42.814
you're still part of our family,

09:42.816 --> 09:44.115
you're our sibling,
you're our sister

09:44.117 --> 09:45.717
and we want you here.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.385
[Chris] If she wants to go,

09:51.023 --> 09:53.992
[Amanda] I'll try and send her
a text message.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.961
Hey Tammy, um, we're gonna go
try to take

09:55.963 --> 09:59.598
a family photo today and, um,

09:59.600 --> 10:00.999
if you want us to come by
and pick you up

10:01.001 --> 10:02.467
and you can still
come with us, or what?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.502
[phone swooshes]

10:08.908 --> 10:10.942
I mean yea, I'm mad at Tammy,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.210
but I'm also mad at myself.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.013
I reacted the same way
she was talking to me.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.982
And I do feel bad for that.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.484
[solemn instrumental
music playing]

10:20.052 --> 10:21.286
[cell phone beeps]

10:22.488 --> 10:24.122
What? Well, she said no.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.191
That's all. Just a big N O.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.893
The way I feel about it,

10:28.895 --> 10:30.795
we've given her
ample opportunity

10:30.797 --> 10:33.832
to join us, join in the fun.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.266
And if she doesn't want to,

10:35.868 --> 10:36.935
better go home.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.069
You know what?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.871
We wouldn't even have to spend

10:39.873 --> 10:42.374
half as much money on some
of the stuff that we spent it on,

10:43.042 --> 10:44.442
had it not been for her.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.177
You know, she needs
to just get over it

10:46.179 --> 10:48.580
and just come out and have a good
time with us. Put the differences aside,

10:48.582 --> 10:49.814
like we always do.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.018
So we can just move on,
all have a good time together.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.687
<i>I think Amanda's kinda
pissin' in the wind,</i>

10:55.689 --> 10:59.424
with her attempt to get
Tammy to do the picture.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.060
But, you know, she
wants to try, so whatever.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.164
I agree, let's go talk
to the bitch.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.432
All right.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.535
<i>We've all decided to go to Tammy</i>

11:10.537 --> 11:14.673
because we just wanna
persuade her to go with us.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.775
I just want Tammy to come out
and just have some fun.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.111
Why be locked up in
a hotel room by yourself?

11:27.053 --> 11:29.688
I guess that means it's time
to get our [bleep] rolled out.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.689
All right, well, you know what?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.190
Let's not tell her we're coming.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.059
Hell no, we gonna
blindside the bitch.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.294
[suspenseful music playing]

11:36.296 --> 11:38.196
Let's get this [bleep]
out of the way.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.037
Okay, I'm done.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.709
This some [bleep] for real.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.244
[bleep] done with this [bleep].

[dramatic music playing]

13:56.802 --> 13:58.036
[Chris] <i>So we're
goin' over to the hotel</i>

13:58.038 --> 14:00.071
to try to talk some
sense into Tammy

14:00.673 --> 14:03.074
<i>Hopefully we can convince
Tammy to stay,</i>

14:03.076 --> 14:06.611
<i>and take this family photo
with us.</i>

14:06.613 --> 14:09.480
That's the whole point
of the vacation

14:09.482 --> 14:12.183
was all five of us,
spending time together.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.886
<i>But just knowing,</i>

14:14.888 --> 14:18.189
<i>that you gotta go in there
and deal with Tammy's</i>

14:18.791 --> 14:19.624
[bleep]

14:25.130 --> 14:26.664
I wish she would just
open up and tell

14:26.666 --> 14:28.533
exactly what her issue is

14:28.535 --> 14:31.002
- why she's acting like this.
- Instead of throwing a fit.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.171
It boils down to her not
getting off her [bleep] lazy ass

14:33.173 --> 14:34.739
and standing up,

14:34.741 --> 14:36.107
and walking up two steps.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.345
When she, if she can do it in
rehab, she can [bleep] done it there.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.914
I'm ready to go now.

14:42.916 --> 14:43.581
Well, first of all,
I don't even know

14:43.583 --> 14:44.949
she's gonna let us in the door

14:44.951 --> 14:47.018
I don't give a [bleep]
if she open the door or not,

14:47.020 --> 14:47.819
Amy got a key.

14:47.821 --> 14:48.753
I'm not gonna go,
if she tells me

14:48.755 --> 14:50.922
not to come in,
I'm not gonna go in.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.324
Yea, I'm gonna tell her regardless,
'cause I don't give a [bleep].

14:53.326 --> 14:56.127
Just give me the room key, I'm
gonna tell her, cuss her out and get out.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.462
[sighs]

14:57.464 --> 14:59.297
The bitch ain't gonna
chase after me.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.765
You know, [bleep].

15:00.767 --> 15:02.500
[bleep] this.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.568
Let's go, get this [bleep]
over with,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.336
'cause I'm not [bleep]
with Tammy no more

15:11.143 --> 15:14.012
It's no surprise that Tammy's
texting me about her stomach.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.089
103.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.362
Knock first.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.398
[door opens]

15:43.842 --> 15:47.245
We gonna see what's wrong
with your stomach.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.314
Stop hollering.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.116
[Tammy speaking]

15:52.118 --> 15:54.018
What is it, your ribs?

15:55.087 --> 15:57.155
[Tammy speaking]

15:57.157 --> 15:59.190
[Chris speaking]

15:59.959 --> 16:01.292
[Tammy speaking]

16:02.094 --> 16:03.795
[Amanda] We wanna know
what you wanna do,

16:03.797 --> 16:04.996
if you wanna stay with us,

16:04.998 --> 16:06.564
stay till we go home,

16:06.566 --> 16:07.632
and do some stuff with us,

16:07.634 --> 16:10.134
or do you want a friend
to come and get you?

16:10.136 --> 16:14.072
[Chris] But it'll be Thursday
before you can even head out.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.442
And it can only be, a day early.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.044
Amanda reached out to
her friend, Rob

16:20.046 --> 16:22.113
<i>who was at
Tammy's birthday party.</i>

16:22.115 --> 16:25.883
And he is willing
to come and get Tammy,

16:25.885 --> 16:28.152
but he can't do it
for another day.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.288
[Tammy speaking]

16:30.290 --> 16:32.357
[all] We have no one
to take you home.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.493
[Amanda speaking]

16:35.495 --> 16:38.463
- Because if we go...
- That messes up our vacation.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.799
[Tammy speaking]

16:41.801 --> 16:44.769
No that is not true. You're
trying to make it all about you.

16:44.771 --> 16:45.803
Don't even do that.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.105
[Amanda speaking]

16:47.107 --> 16:49.273
[Tammy speaking]

16:51.877 --> 16:53.411
[Amanda speaking]

16:54.880 --> 16:56.114
[Tammy speaking]

16:57.950 --> 16:58.983
[Amy] Okay, I'm done.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.119
[Chris] Just make sure
she gets something to eat.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.421
Tell your little [bleep] boy
in Las Vegas, hello.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.926
[Tammy speaking]

17:20.606 --> 17:22.940
And you still talking
to the [bleep]?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.781
What, in God's green earth,
are you doing, talking to him?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.616
This some [bleep].

17:31.618 --> 17:35.720
[Amanda] I suggest everybody
stay out of my face right now, for real.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.356
[Amanda] No [bleep] come up here and bother
me right now, give me a [bleep] minute.

17:39.658 --> 17:43.161
[scoffs]
Done with this [bleep].

17:43.163 --> 17:46.130
In there with the God damned
[bleep] boy on the God damned phone.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.867
She's in her [bleep]
phone with Phil,

17:49.869 --> 17:51.469
she's probably been talking
to the [bleep] boy

17:51.471 --> 17:53.171
the whole God damned time
she's been here.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.706
This is the BBW [bleep] king.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.908
[bleep] rat bastard.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.644
[Amy] Yea, the one that
she called the cops on.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.612
The [bleep] probably
said something to her

18:01.614 --> 18:04.549
to keep her and get her
in his damn mood.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.718
Look, that's her life, that's
okay. If they good, they good.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.687
But to ruin a whole
goddamned family vacation

18:09.689 --> 18:12.223
because she wants to sit in there
and talk on the phone with him?

18:12.991 --> 18:15.927
I guess Tammy is gonna get Rob
to come after her.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.830
- Yeah.
- He'll pick her up.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.699
He'll go tomorrow, he'll get
a rental, he'll come down.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.867
Pick her up Thursday morning

18:22.869 --> 18:24.635
[Chris] Stay in the cabin
with us until the next morning

18:24.637 --> 18:26.437
and taking Tammy's
[bleep] fat ass home.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.573
[Amanda] Thursday morning
and take her home.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.808
<i>[Amy] Tammy just wants Phil
because he's bad for her.</i>

18:30.810 --> 18:34.745
I guess she just wanna live
life to the fullest,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.415
do what she wants
until she can't do nothing.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.198
Let's get you
strapped in here safely.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.800
Whoo!

18:55.802 --> 18:59.904
Rollercoasters is something Chris
had been wanting to do for 20 years.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.206
So I'm gonna need you to
sit up tall for me, okay.

19:02.208 --> 19:06.210
The safety-light on the
harness would not turn green.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.185
[country music playing]

19:16.054 --> 19:17.455
<i>Come on, Chris.</i>

19:17.457 --> 19:18.990
<i>I'm hoping that, by my hair.</i>

19:18.992 --> 19:20.324
[Amy] All right,
I'll hold on to this.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.469
[Amy speaking]

19:36.041 --> 19:37.608
- Hey.
- How are you guys doing?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.310
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.612
- Oh, look at this, Dad.
- We got the whole setup in here.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.481
Okay, okay.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.449
- So, this is all the costumes and stuff.
- You got it, okay.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.152
- Lots of options for you guys.
- Okay.

19:49.888 --> 19:52.089
<i>- [Amy] Just grab whatever we want.
- So, the bottom part of that</i>

19:52.091 --> 19:53.391
<i>will help you get into it.</i>

19:53.992 --> 19:55.359
[Amy speaking]

20:04.970 --> 20:07.805
- Okay.
- [Amy speaking]

20:07.807 --> 20:10.875
- Girl, we got sizes for everyone.
<i>- [Amy] Okay.</i>

20:10.877 --> 20:13.477
- [baby cooing]
<i>- [Amanda] Oh, are you excited?</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:15.980
Uh-huh. We're gonna get it.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.848
Are you wanting, like,
fishnets and stuff?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.084
- [Chris grunts]
- Oh, sure, why not?

20:20.086 --> 20:21.085
- Yeah...
- Let's just do the whole thing.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.853
Hell yeah. We're gonna
let it all hang out.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.122
- Bam!
- [Chris speaking]

20:26.692 --> 20:30.094
[Amanda] Oh, well, she's
the crazy bitch. [laughs]

20:30.096 --> 20:32.496
It actually fits
your personality to a tee.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.798
<i>[Amy] What is this?</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:36.901
That's a Southern Belle dress.
It's a dress and the shoulders

20:36.903 --> 20:39.170
are, like, off the shoulder.
It's really pretty.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.606
All right, come on, Sis.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.774
[Amanda] Hold on, I'm missing
a piece of leather on my booby.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.909
- So...
- Is that too tight?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.044
-No
-[Amanda speaking]

20:48.480 --> 20:51.015
- [laughs]
- [banjo music playing]

20:53.986 --> 20:56.988
- [Amy speaking]
- [laughs]

21:00.025 --> 21:02.026
<i>[Chris] It's pretty cool
that the costumes</i>

21:02.028 --> 21:04.228
<i>were kind of, like,
"one size fit all."</i>

21:04.230 --> 21:05.963
<i>They had drawer strings
in the back.</i>

21:05.965 --> 21:07.798
<i>But you couldn't see,</i>

21:07.800 --> 21:10.268
so they pulled 'em tight
and that's what we did.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.070
[baby cooing]

21:14.940 --> 21:16.040
[Amanda speaking]

21:16.042 --> 21:17.908
Damn, Amanda.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.844
I cannot help what God
gave me. Don't hate.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.445
[Amy speaking]

21:22.814 --> 21:25.082
[chuckles] You're always
making fun of my girls.

21:25.751 --> 21:26.984
Brittany's costume.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.253
- Brittany fits her persona...
- I like the color of yours.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.388
She's a church lady,
we're whores.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.722
[laughs]

21:31.724 --> 21:35.126
[Amanda] Actually, Mike and
Chris look like that right there.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.461
- Looks good.
- That's some real stuff right there.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.996
[Amy speaking]

21:44.803 --> 21:47.471
Okay, my brother's gonna
get this... Don't look.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.041
- Okay, don't look.
- Don't step on my skirt.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.075
All right, you ladies
can do your fans,

21:51.077 --> 21:52.710
or if you wanna
do, like, guns and whiskey...

21:52.712 --> 21:54.278
- I want a gun and some whiskey.
- Gun and whiskey?

21:54.280 --> 21:56.080
[chuckles]
Uh, do we have everybody?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.715
- Got everybody?
- Yeah.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.684
Okay. Awesome.
You guys look good.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.820
Just wish Tam was here,
but, I mean, that's her choice.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.388
She's the one missing out.
It'll be all right.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.090
Yeah, for sure.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.926
<i>[Amy] Tammy not being there, just...
It makes me feel bad because, like,</i>

22:08.928 --> 22:13.497
Gage can look and be, like,
"Where's Aunt Tammy in this picture?"

22:13.499 --> 22:14.865
I'm like, "Well,
Aunt Tammy is being a bitch

22:14.867 --> 22:17.902
who won't stay
in the damn picture."

22:17.904 --> 22:20.137
[chuckles] Big, happy smiles,
everybody. Say "whiskey."

22:20.139 --> 22:21.672
- [all] Whiskey.
- [chuckles]

22:21.674 --> 22:22.973
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Awesome.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.241
[Amanda] <i>It was a
stress reliever for me</i>

22:24.243 --> 22:27.044
- like, it was really fun getting into character and...
- Yeah.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.847
- I'll cherish those memories forever.
- Yeah, I liked doing that.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.717
<i>[Amanda] We all had on
spike high heels.</i>

22:32.719 --> 22:33.884
<i>- [Misty] Yeah.
- [Amanda] We wasn't walking nowhere</i>

22:33.886 --> 22:35.753
- we was leaning.
- We just...

22:35.755 --> 22:37.922
-Yeah.
-But we haven't done... like we were standing up.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.091
[imperceptible] [laughs]

22:40.093 --> 22:41.559
I'm gonna give you the dynamite.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.027
- [gasps]
- [chuckles]

22:43.029 --> 22:44.829
[man] Just kind of toss it
over this way.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.464
One, two, three.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.865
- [clatters]
- That was good.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.101
- [camera shutter clicks] -
You guys look pretty terrified.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.369
[Amanda speaking]

22:52.037 --> 22:54.071
[all laugh]

22:55.273 --> 22:57.341
[cheerful music playing]

23:02.481 --> 23:04.949
[Chris speaking]

23:04.951 --> 23:08.486
I think we're gonna have a great
time today. I'm super excited for today.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.921
Today, we're all gonna go
to the park

23:10.923 --> 23:13.257
<i>to ride some rollercoasters.</i>

23:17.796 --> 23:20.698
<i>[Amy] But the upside is...
there's no lines.</i>

23:20.700 --> 23:22.767
I get on first, bitches.
[chuckles]

23:22.769 --> 23:25.603
I don't know what that was.
[laughs]

23:25.605 --> 23:27.905
Misty, you almost can't make it.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.641
- [laughs]
- [bleep] Oh. my God, for real.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.977
[Amanda speaking]

23:32.979 --> 23:34.779
[woman] You might have to ride
with an adult.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.113
I got you, sis.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.415
So, you're gonna be her adult

23:37.417 --> 23:40.151
I absolutely will tell her
what to do.

23:40.153 --> 23:42.920
[Chris] <i>We're just a bunch
of kids when we get together.</i>

23:42.922 --> 23:44.321
We're all picking on each other.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.123
Any chance we get.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.025
- Six adults, except for Misty.
- Yeah.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.460
She gets a child one, right?

23:49.527 --> 23:53.063
- Yeah, I'll give her a kids...
- [laughs boisterously]

23:53.065 --> 23:56.100
Just the whole best part of it is
being able to do stuff together.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.469
[Amy] Okay, y'all, which one
y'all wanna do first?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.403
We're gonna do this
back over here.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.272
So, I think we walk
straight down.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.507
<i>[Amanda] I love this. The memories
that we're making is the best.</i>

24:03.509 --> 24:05.743
<i>[Amy] I wish Tammy
could've been here.</i>

24:05.745 --> 24:08.612
<i>[Amanda] You know, I really wish
tammy could've been here with us today.</i>

24:08.614 --> 24:10.481
Although I know that she probably
couldn't ride any of the rides

24:10.483 --> 24:12.450
that was here. It's just,
you know the togetherness

24:12.452 --> 24:14.752
of being together with your
siblings in the same place.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.354
<i>[Amanda] But as of right now,
she's still at the hotel</i>

24:17.356 --> 24:20.057
where we've made arrangements
for her to be picked up and taken home

24:20.059 --> 24:22.760
by a good friend of ours, so...

24:22.762 --> 24:24.595
I'm not gonna let that
ruin my time, though

24:24.597 --> 24:26.730
<i>I'm gonna come, I'm gonna
have a good time here today</i>

24:26.732 --> 24:28.899
riding these rollercoasters,
and just tell her

24:28.901 --> 24:31.202
"You should've been there."

24:31.204 --> 24:34.038
I mean, I'm ready to ride, but I'm
not gonna be the first one to get on.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.673
Hey, let's go in order of age.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.309
Go Misty, Chris, Amanda,
Michael and then Amy.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.176
The weight limit on this is 375.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.478
That's the max I can put
on each one, okay?

25:14.480 --> 25:16.113
Leaves me out.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.083
- You are... How much do you weigh?
- I'm right at 375.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.417
[Chris]
I'm not taking a chance.

25:21.653 --> 25:25.456
- It's right at 375.
- It's 375, he's still good if you wanna ride.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.625
- [Amanda] You don't wanna ride?
- You're good.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.793
- Well, I mean, I do, but I don't wanna...
- [speaking indistinctly]

25:29.795 --> 25:31.495
[operator] No, no, no,
you're still good.

25:31.497 --> 25:32.730
[operator]
You're still good, sir.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.298
Yeah, yeah, no, you're good
You're good.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.500
Let's you get strapped in.
Yeah, it's safe.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.409
Whoo!

25:46.044 --> 25:47.144
- Whoo!
- Oh.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.048
[Amy speaking]

25:58.490 --> 26:00.891
When you go around, you're gonna
shoot all these black and yellow targets

26:00.893 --> 26:04.128
out here in the field.
Shoot as fast as you can.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.896
[operator]
All right, you ready?

26:05.898 --> 26:06.830
- How many points?
- Okay.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.933
- [operator] 9,900.
- [Michael] Get down.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.168
- [Amanda] Can we add our points together...
- [operator] No.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.037
[Amanda] 'Cause we're a
family, you know, we're one unit.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.371
You know, we're all together.

26:14.373 --> 26:17.007
- [operator laughs]
- We're all on this together.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.944
All right, so I'm gonna need
you to sit up tall for me, okay?

26:19.946 --> 26:22.112
Like, scoot back in the seat
as much as you can.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.983
There we go.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.086
[indistinct chatter]

26:29.821 --> 26:32.256
The safety light on the harness

26:33.124 --> 26:35.025
will not turn green.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.061
Can you sit up taller for me?

26:37.063 --> 26:39.196
- I can't, that's it.
- You can't, that's it? Okay.

26:52.477 --> 26:53.877
Can you sit up taller for me?

26:53.879 --> 26:55.746
- I can't, that's it.
- You can't, that's it? Okay.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.481
Sorry about that.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.751
It's probably been near 20 years
since Chris rode rollercoasters

27:00.753 --> 27:02.720
or any kind of, you know,
rides at an amusement park

27:02.722 --> 27:04.822
simply because of his weight.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.825
<i>[Amanda] So, I'm, you know,
hoping he can actually ride</i>

27:07.827 --> 27:10.461
because, you know,
for him to come so far

27:10.463 --> 27:12.863
and then to be turned around
at this point

27:12.865 --> 27:15.966
I mean, for me... I mean, I would
cry. It'd be devastating for me.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.135
I mean, and I know
it'd be for him, too.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.340
Okay, let's try this
other seat here.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.110
[Amanda]
Hey, pick your roll up.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.678
- Yeah, I picked my roll up.
- Like, pick it.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.481
Like, you know,
adjust it like that.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.449
All right,
let's see what happens here.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.919
All right, now, yeah, slide
back as far as you can

27:35.921 --> 27:38.088
- and then... Okay.
- I'm as back as is...

27:39.124 --> 27:40.991
Let me push you
just a little bit more.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.826
[operator] There we go.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.461
- We got it? Yay!
- [operator] There we go, man!

27:44.463 --> 27:46.463
You ready? You're safe.
Are you comfortable?

27:46.465 --> 27:48.198
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Awesome.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.735
Let's get you up in the air
and have some fun.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.871
[operator] Here we go.
Shoot fast.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.640
Luckily, with a little bit
of maneuvering,

27:56.642 --> 27:58.742
<i>he was able to get it, and
then, you know, he took off</i>

27:58.744 --> 28:02.112
<i>- and I can hear him laughing.
- [Chris laughs]</i>

28:02.114 --> 28:04.715
It was almost like [chuckles],
that was like my big brother

28:04.717 --> 28:06.116
when he was little,
that little...

28:06.118 --> 28:07.651
That little kid laugh
that come out.

28:07.653 --> 28:10.220
There's your gun. Pop it fast.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.923
- So it's very doable to get that 9,900.
- I don't care what I get.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.125
- You can't get...
- As long as I get more than them.

28:16.027 --> 28:16.994
[operator]
You're not nervous, are you?

28:16.996 --> 28:18.262
[Amy speaking]

28:18.763 --> 28:20.931
Oh, you're the blind one?
That's okay.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.734
Just shoot like crazy, okay?
That's all you gotta do.

28:23.736 --> 28:24.802
[Amy speaking]

28:24.804 --> 28:26.603
There we go.
You wanna go double barrel?

28:26.605 --> 28:29.940
-[Amy speaking] -Okay,
we'll do it. Let's do it.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.875
I've never been good at
shooting or anything like that

28:31.877 --> 28:33.777
<i>because of my eyesight.</i>

28:33.779 --> 28:37.381
So, they all get one gun,
I got two, bitches.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.117
[banjo music playing]

28:45.023 --> 28:47.291
[screams]
I don't like this [bleep].

28:51.196 --> 28:52.429
[Chris speaking]

29:06.244 --> 29:08.679
[Chris] This thing is fun!
[laughs]

29:08.681 --> 29:09.980
[Chris speaking]

29:11.082 --> 29:13.117
[laughs heartily] Oh, jeez.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.954
[shrieks] Oh, no,
I don't like this [bleep].

29:18.857 --> 29:20.390
- [operator] Do you like that?
- [Chris speaking]

29:21.693 --> 29:22.793
- [operator laughs]
- Hey.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.461
- Look at that right there.
- There you go.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.263
- You got that 9,900 my friend.
- You got it.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.903
-I got 5,500.
-9,999. [chuckles]

29:32.905 --> 29:36.240
[Amanda] My life was more
important to me than you all.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.108
She got two guns.

29:40.478 --> 29:41.678
[all laughing]

29:41.680 --> 29:44.414
She's got 6,800
between both guns.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.151
Now, that's not fair. I could have
got more if I had both my guns.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.855
[Misty]
<i>Amy cheated with the guns.</i>

29:51.857 --> 29:55.492
Everybody else she's won.
She's used two. That's cheating.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.060
[Chris]
I just go [bleep].

29:57.062 --> 29:58.862
[Amanda]
No, no. I'm not going again.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.130
All right.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.169
[Chris]
Here we going. Whoo!

30:10.642 --> 30:14.511
I think everybody's having
a lot of fun but honestly,

30:14.513 --> 30:18.415
I wanted Tammy to be here
because, I don't want her to feel left out.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.474
<i>[Amy] Our friend Rob is
coming to pick up Tammy.</i>

30:44.476 --> 30:47.744
But with Tammy talking to Philip
again, I don't feel comfortable

30:47.746 --> 30:49.980
with her going home without us.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.716
It's just a bad combination
all the way around.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.052
Maybe if dinner goes great,
she will want to stay

30:55.054 --> 30:57.154
a couple of days and
have some fun with us.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.955
[baby gurgling]

31:34.959 --> 31:38.095
[Amanda] So, remember when
we went and got the family photos?

31:43.468 --> 31:46.737
Tammy was some type of way
about us looking at the pictures.

31:46.739 --> 31:51.341
You won't shut up. How much [bleep]
anything if you can't keep [bleep]?

31:56.514 --> 31:58.348
[instrumental music playing]

32:08.693 --> 32:10.627
<i>[Chris] It's probably gonna
be a shot in the dark.</i>

32:10.629 --> 32:15.065
But hopefully, we can still
convince her to stay.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.176
We got her a motorized wheelchair,
so we wouldn't have to push her.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.345
- You wanna ride?
- No, I'm good.

32:34.819 --> 32:35.952
Okay. Very carefully here.

32:36.220 --> 32:39.156
[Chris] All right. Go over
to your right a little bit.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.490
[Amanda] Mm-hmm.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.494
Okay. Hold on here.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.131
[bleep]

32:49.901 --> 32:53.737
[chuckles] I don't know what
the hell I'm doing. Hang on, here.

32:53.739 --> 32:57.207
Now, just uh pull it back
a little bit.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.109
I don't know how
to work it now. Like...

32:59.444 --> 33:01.912
Oh, there it goes.

33:01.914 --> 33:04.281
- You wanna see if she can just walk out here?
- It'd nice.

33:05.383 --> 33:06.450
Hi girl.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.319
Tammy got her hot pink
on looking good. Okay.

33:10.788 --> 33:13.790
[Amanda] Girl, it's super easy.
I'll show you. It's super easy.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.959
-[Chris] Come on, girl.
-[Amanda] Okay, come on sis. You got this.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.729
- [Chris] You have the freedom you never had before.
- [Amanda] You got this.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.164
[Amanda] You're gonna love
the wheelchair. I promise you.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.103
Okay, That will come
off if we needed...

33:26.105 --> 33:28.505
[Tammy] I don't need it.
Just let me-- I mean [chuckles]

33:35.980 --> 33:37.280
[Chris] There we go!

33:38.182 --> 33:40.183
And the other leg, too.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.153
[Amanda]
There you go!

33:43.155 --> 33:45.055
So, when you do it, you're
gonna do little movements like this.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.791
Don't jerk, you're gonna
do little movements.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.260
And you'll find your
happy spot there.

33:50.728 --> 33:51.695
- [Amanda] Just--
- [Tammy] Whoo!

33:51.996 --> 33:54.164
[Amanda] Just go slow.
You'll figure it out.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.035
Here we go!

33:58.269 --> 34:00.070
All right. You got this, girl.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.705
- [Tammy] No.
- [Amanda] No, you got it.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.106
[Amanda] Like I said,
whenever you feel

34:03.108 --> 34:05.942
you're going where you don't
wanna go, just let go off it.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.454
We'll lift your feet up.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.390
Now, raise up, kick it hard, girl,
like you're kicking somebody's ass.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.493
Okay. One more, one more.
You're almost there.

34:24.095 --> 34:26.163
Oh, almost. There we go!

34:50.354 --> 34:53.056
[Amanda]
You gotta get used to it.

34:54.625 --> 34:57.594
Now, look okay for the first
time I know it was a trip but like--

34:57.596 --> 35:01.965
After like 30 minutes on that thing, when I
was messing with it, I know what I'm doing.

35:01.967 --> 35:05.802
So, give yourself a good 30 minutes.
Girl you're gonna be able to [bleep] well.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.204
You ain't wanna give it back.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.239
[Amy speaking]

35:32.830 --> 35:35.699
You would.
I promise you, you would.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.034
Cause it's open. Like you would
just wheel your wheelchair through

35:38.036 --> 35:39.936
the front door and then take a
left and then you would've

35:39.938 --> 35:41.438
been straight into your bedroom.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.008
And the doors are big enough
to fit the wheelchair through it too.

35:57.788 --> 36:01.158
<i>[Amy] I wanted to come to Monster
Mash Burgers, because it's horror theme.</i>

36:01.160 --> 36:02.492
And you don't get that
in Kentucky.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.961
I've never seen
a horror themed restaurant.

36:04.963 --> 36:09.833
But I didn't even really care what we ate,
just long as we ate together as a family.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.936
[Amanda] I wouldn't walk in front of
Tammy. She just got her driver's licence.

36:12.938 --> 36:16.540
Actually just she got her
permit to drive.

36:16.542 --> 36:20.944
I'm hoping that this dinner, we can all
have a good time and eat some good food.

36:28.452 --> 36:32.422
[Amanda] Beetlejuice's
breakfast, Poltergeist chicken,

36:32.424 --> 36:35.258
<i>Silence of the lamb. Okay.</i>

36:35.260 --> 36:38.395
Amy what makes you wanna come
here? Of all the places to eat down here,

36:38.397 --> 36:39.963
why did you choose here?

36:46.270 --> 36:51.408
I really like horror and to be here
is something I always wanted to do.

37:00.184 --> 37:01.952
Gage!

37:02.019 --> 37:03.486
Hi, buddy!

37:04.188 --> 37:07.157
[Tammy]
Hi! Do you not recognize me?

37:07.159 --> 37:08.558
Do I look different?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.826
[Amy speaking]

37:15.233 --> 37:17.734
[Amanda] Are we so-- So we're
just eating what we want today

37:17.736 --> 37:19.836
and not worrying
about our diet, guys.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.272
[Amy] Nah, I ain't got time
for a diet today.

37:22.274 --> 37:25.141
Well, you need to-- You gotta
have time everyday though.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.244
[Tammy speaking]

37:37.755 --> 37:40.757
Do you all need a few more minutes
to look over the menu or you're ready?

37:40.759 --> 37:43.493
- [Amanda] I think we're pretty much ready.
- [Tammy] We're ready.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.996
I'm gonna get the Myers
BBQ and blue.

37:49.834 --> 37:52.102
- I want the Chuckey.
- [woman] Which one, the Chuckey?

37:52.104 --> 37:53.470
Yeah.

38:13.524 --> 38:16.726
As far as Amy's diet. I'm not
sure exactly what she's doing.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.629
She says that we're on vacation,
we can splurge today, but

38:19.631 --> 38:21.131
<i>that's kinda worrying me.</i>

38:24.869 --> 38:29.205
So, it does worry me that she's so
early on eating the way that she does.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.251
Because I've stuff
in my pocket, okay?

38:41.253 --> 38:43.286
It's my pocket.
Excuse me.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.088
[bleep]

38:48.659 --> 38:51.461
[chuckles]
Oh, [bleep].

38:51.463 --> 38:54.397
[Amanda] So, remember when
we went and got the family photos?

38:58.102 --> 38:59.336
[Tammy speaking]

39:02.039 --> 39:03.273
[Amanda] Girl!

39:06.577 --> 39:08.010
Don't start, please.

39:18.556 --> 39:23.226
Cause she threw a little tantrum.
Oh, no. She wasn't happy about it.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.298
Didn't stop her eating
that cheese burger.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.368
[Amanda] So, [clears throat]
that wheelchair,

39:31.370 --> 39:35.171
how do you think, does it help your
mobility, your freedom so to speak?

39:38.809 --> 39:41.010
- [Chris] It's a blessing to have it.
- [Amanda] It really is.

39:41.012 --> 39:45.415
It's not-- It's a whole lot
easier to plug that up at night.

39:45.417 --> 39:48.618
And then you just get in
and whirl yourself around.

39:48.620 --> 39:52.989
<i>[Tammy] It was a little difficult
using the electric wheelchair.</i>

40:06.871 --> 40:08.772
[Amanda] I'm really grateful
I have her for this trip.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.875
It really does take-- I mean
I'm not trying to be ugly but

40:11.877 --> 40:15.245
It does take the burden
of the body.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.083
What do you think now that you
actually experienced driving it?

40:28.826 --> 40:29.759
[Tammy speaking]

40:29.761 --> 40:33.463
- [Amanda] It is easy.
- Will you shut up?

40:33.465 --> 40:36.232
[Amanda] Tammy, you're not
gonna keep hollering at me like that.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.436
Everybody's bent over back,
but it's rude.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.109
- Bitch don't try me like that.
- Shut the [bleep].

40:51.015 --> 40:52.816
She's the one that's
acting like a dummy.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.250
How about you shut up for once.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.155
You won't shut up.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.260
[Amanda speaking]

41:05.162 --> 41:06.996
You gonna stay the [bleep]
away from me.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.265
You can kiss my ass.

41:13.904 --> 41:16.906
<i>[Chris] Next time on
1000 lb sisters.</i>

41:16.908 --> 41:18.741
They accepted our
offer on the house.

41:18.743 --> 41:19.742
Like you're really buying house?

41:19.744 --> 41:22.479
We go sign papers
in a couple days.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.215
With you moving what we gonna
do with Tammy's situation?

41:25.217 --> 41:26.115
I don't know.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.750
[Chris speaking]

41:27.752 --> 41:29.752
That's the only thing left.

41:29.754 --> 41:32.222
Are you all believers
in paranormal?

41:32.224 --> 41:34.491
You guys wanna do some
investigation yourself?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.164
We're like oooo!

41:42.166 --> 41:45.969
We may have caught some kind of
a dark entity. Almost looks like a cat.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.303
[baby cooing]

41:49.206 --> 41:50.373
[baby cooing]

41:52.543 --> 41:54.210
[both laughing]

41:54.212 --> 41:58.047
I just made an offer on the
house and they accepted it.

41:58.883 --> 42:01.050
So, we're gonna move soon.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.720
Amy and I are like super close.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.088
<i>I am used to her being here.</i>

42:05.090 --> 42:07.056
I'm losing my best friend.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.691
You're gonna be all right.
Don't you?

42:08.693 --> 42:11.160
I don't know. We'll find out.

42:12.396 --> 42:14.864
So, what kinda drink we got?
You gonna make me more?

42:14.866 --> 42:17.800
We can make some screwdrivers,
margaritas. We got moonshine.

42:17.802 --> 42:18.701
- Ooh!
- To the Queen!

42:18.703 --> 42:20.236
[all] To the Queen.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.306
One day she went drinking,
next day she started drinking.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.407
[all cheering]
