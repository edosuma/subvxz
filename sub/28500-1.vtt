00:46.814 --> 00:49.948
      (electrical buzzing)

00:54.088 --> 00:55.587
      - [P'Torr Voiceover]
      So many worlds.

00:55.589 --> 00:59.291
     So many dimensions,
     all teeming with life.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.864
 I move through the dimensions,

01:05.866 --> 01:09.168
   God-like but still a man.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.171
 A man gifted with great power.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.405
       I am the creator.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.940
          I am P'Torr.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.579
I traveled across the universe,

01:20.581 --> 01:23.348
 an exile fleeing my old world.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.454
 I discovered Yamasong and
 planned to live there quietly,

01:29.824 --> 01:33.325
   there with my mechanical
   companions, my creations.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.229
       We had peace until
       my Hollow Children

01:37.231 --> 01:39.098
      turned on the
      natives of Yamasong.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.633
          (screaming)

01:41.635 --> 01:43.836
       Turned them into
       horrible machines.

01:45.139 --> 01:49.241
 Like the Gods of old I poured
 my anger upon my Hollows.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.945
    Crushing their plans and
    placing them in a prison

01:52.947 --> 01:55.614
      above the world they
      tried to conquer.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.853
      (machinery clicking)

02:00.855 --> 02:03.255
But one day there was an escape.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.492
   She had been created from
   pieces of other Hollows

02:06.494 --> 02:07.759
      on the Prison Moon.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.699
    But she was an innocent.

02:13.701 --> 02:17.269
  Unburdened by the corruption
  of her builder, Yari.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.540
      (machinery clicking)

02:21.542 --> 02:22.941
       (portal whooshing)

02:22.943 --> 02:26.411
 Because of this, she bypassed
 the barriers I created

02:26.413 --> 02:28.380
 and fell to the planet below.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.551
      (machinery clicking)

02:32.553 --> 02:33.819
       (water splashing)

02:33.821 --> 02:36.522
      By chance she met a
      native of Yamasong.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.791
 A Terrapin warrior who became
 her guide and companion.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.367
They traveled the wondrous
world together for a short time.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.507
       (statue whooshing)

03:00.080 --> 03:03.081
      (suspenseful music)

03:04.485 --> 03:09.121
   Now they are separated but
   their bond is not severed.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.758
   (suspenseful hymnal music)

03:14.862 --> 03:19.031
   A new kind of being, part
   living, part mechanical.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.168
       When she returned
       to the Prison Moon

03:23.170 --> 03:27.773
     she discovered that
     her incredible journey
     had changed her.

03:27.775 --> 03:32.844
 Now, in her mechanical chest
 was beating a patchwork heart,

03:33.881 --> 03:36.682
   and she saw with new eyes.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.117
The eyes of her Terrapin friend.

03:40.221 --> 03:44.223
    Such strange miracles,
    where will they take us?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.928

04:08.649 --> 04:10.349
        The Prison Moon.

04:10.351 --> 04:14.186
  An instrument of punishment,
  an act of rage and guilt

04:14.188 --> 04:17.154
     built to house my
     mechanical creations.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.259
   Their sentence for trying
   to conquer the world,

04:20.261 --> 04:23.929
      forever teased with
      a view of Yamasong.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.266
      Always out of reach.

    wishes to speak to you.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.962
      (machinery clanging)

05:17.618 --> 05:22.688
- So my child, my precious
daughter, you have secrets now?

05:24.224 --> 05:26.825
   - Who could keep a secret
   from you mother dear?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.694
    - You did well my child.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.063
      You found your way
      to the world below.

05:31.065 --> 05:35.000
    Perhaps one day you will
    help us return with you.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.471
  - I don't rightly know what
  happened to me, or how.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.041
       - Well, no matter.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.609
        Go rest darling.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.715
        Perhaps one day.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.389

06:11.405 --> 06:14.373
       (ghostly whispers)

06:17.978 --> 06:21.246
  An ancient enemy of Yamasong
  sending soot storms.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.849
     Thousands of
     formless, angry souls

06:23.851 --> 06:25.717
 to ravage the beautiful world.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.424

       to feast on flesh,

06:43.904 --> 06:46.171

      the planet below.

      (suspenseful music)

07:24.945 --> 07:26.344

08:29.776 --> 08:31.843
      I'm so far from the
      warm shores of home.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.118

08:47.728 --> 08:50.862

09:04.344 --> 09:06.678
           (exhaling)

09:11.818 --> 09:12.717
             Hello!

09:13.820 --> 09:15.787
     Which way back to the
     warm comforting sea?

09:21.461 --> 09:22.694
         Ah, my thanks.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.598

        (peaceful music)

09:36.310 --> 09:37.976
        - Unbelievable.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.779
These Terrapin are getting bold.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.714
      What is this one
      doing on our lands?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.116
           (moaning)

09:45.118 --> 09:47.185
     Hey Geta, are you
     going to listen to me?

09:47.187 --> 09:50.355
    Or do I have to rip your
    play friend to pieces?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.289
            (laughs)

09:51.291 --> 09:52.424
   - Calm down brother Brujt.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
      You can't let small
      things get to you.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.363
       If you can't keep
       your temper now,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.398
     what will you do is
     something bad happens?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.435
    - Maybe it already
    has, see that Terrapin?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.869
  - Ah, maybe he's just lost.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.905
           (groaning)

10:06.907 --> 10:08.807
        (dramatic music)

10:08.809 --> 10:09.941
         - Ho, ho, ho!

10:13.680 --> 10:15.313
           (groaning)

10:15.315 --> 10:17.282
       (bones crunching)

10:17.284 --> 10:18.950
   - Be careful big brother.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.887
  Your relatives are harder
  to hide from than intruders.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.325
       Think about who's
       more dangerous.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.228
    - Enough horseplay Geta.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.130
       Let's see what the
       Terrapin is up to.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.605
Perhaps we've found a sacrifice.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.477
      (suspenseful music)

10:51.318 --> 10:54.419
      (machinery clicking)

10:54.421 --> 10:56.921
       - Hey, nothing to
       worry about girl.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.124
   We'll be back in familiar
   land before long.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.928
         (wind howling)

            (groans)

11:17.044 --> 11:20.045
  - You're trespassing friend.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.713
           (groaning)

11:21.715 --> 11:24.516

13:19.332 --> 13:21.800
          (wind howls)

13:25.438 --> 13:27.705
      - [P'Torr Voiceover]
      The great gyroscope,

13:27.707 --> 13:29.240
 the heart of the Prison Moon.

13:30.644 --> 13:34.379
  Nani comes here to listen to
  the rhythm of vast machine,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.948
      to draw comfort from
      its lulling motion.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.350
       - I wish I could
       float in the ocean

13:39.352 --> 13:40.985
      and watch from afar.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.554
    Rocked by it's rhythms.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.256
      Yet there's no
      water on this moon.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.127
    - [P'Torr Voiceover] Now
    that her mechanical body

13:49.129 --> 13:52.831
  has its own heart, she feels
  a kinship with the machine.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.502
     The other Hollows are
     not allowed in this
     room by my design,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.839
       but Nani was never
       part of my plan.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.209
      (machinery clicking)

14:04.211 --> 14:05.310
       A patchwork heart.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.648
      (suspenseful music)

14:10.650 --> 14:13.384
   The gyroscopic mechanisms
   of the Prison Moon

14:13.386 --> 14:16.421
    were never meant to
    contain a beating heart.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.625
      (electrical buzzing)

14:26.700 --> 14:28.433
       (glass shattering)

14:28.435 --> 14:30.001
       - What's going on?

14:30.837 --> 14:33.071
     (machinery whistling)

14:33.073 --> 14:36.140
      (suspenseful music)

14:41.047 --> 14:46.117
- The time is near that we
return to rule the world below.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.953
     Through the actions of
     our dear sister Nani,

14:48.955 --> 14:53.458
      the ships orbit has
      been disrupted and
      we fly to Yamasong.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.994
       Our triumphant
       return is at hand.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.763
       Nani may be too
       young to remember,

14:58.765 --> 15:02.567
 but the rest of you, the rest
 of you remember our glory,

15:02.569 --> 15:07.639
 our rule, or should I say our
 service to the world below.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.641
    We will walk free again

15:09.643 --> 15:11.843
    and we will make
    everything right again.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.878
    Are you with me sisters?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.614
           (cheering)

15:16.616 --> 15:20.218
      Nani, there is such
      potential in you.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.590
      (machinery rattling)

15:27.260 --> 15:30.328
      (suspenseful music)

15:44.044 --> 15:47.111
      (suspenseful music)

16:20.246 --> 16:22.547
           (groaning)

16:27.253 --> 16:30.321
    - [Brujt And Greta] All
    praise Hollow Goddesses,

16:30.323 --> 16:32.623
  all praise Hollow Goddesses.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.894
      (suspenseful music)

16:45.905 --> 16:48.172
           (groaning)

16:48.174 --> 16:52.076
 (singing in foreign language)

17:02.856 --> 17:04.222
        (metal cracking)

17:04.223 --> 17:06.624
          (screaming)

17:13.299 --> 17:16.099
        (metal clanging)

17:17.704 --> 17:20.671
  - No, no my precious child.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.173
       I can't lose you!

17:23.108 --> 17:25.910
      (machinery clicking)

17:25.912 --> 17:29.814
 (singing in foreign language)

17:45.999 --> 17:48.866
       - Please, you're
       making a mistake.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.468
      Your Goddesses don't
      need a sacrifice.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.970
     - Be silent Terrapin.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.605
        - Why such hate?

17:54.607 --> 17:58.309
  Our people haven't warred
  in years, there's been peace

17:58.311 --> 18:01.012
    ever since the Hollows
    were locked in the moon.

18:01.014 --> 18:04.515
   Can't you, can't you see
   that you don't need them.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.150
     - But we do need them.

18:06.152 --> 18:10.421
  On this day, we will let the
  Goddesses decide your fate.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.891
  They will free you from the
  constraints of your body,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.660
   see into your very heart.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.463
A gift they bring to all beings.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.568
   Tonight when moonlight
   descends upon this temple,

18:24.471 --> 18:26.871
  that gift shall be received.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.575
      (suspenseful music)

18:30.577 --> 18:33.411
        (rocks thudding)

18:48.495 --> 18:50.561
      Bless you Goddesses.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.296
      A unmistakable sign
      they are returning

18:52.298 --> 18:53.564
    to claim what is theirs.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.671
      - This is no way for
      a warrior to die.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.106
     Helpless like a child.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.242
           (groaning)

19:04.244 --> 19:06.878
         (sword clangs)

19:09.349 --> 19:12.416
      (suspenseful music)

19:15.321 --> 19:19.223
 (singing in foreign language)

19:21.694 --> 19:23.561
   - Come join me my sisters,

19:23.563 --> 19:27.732
    return to your service
    my brave Ovis warriors,

19:27.734 --> 19:29.934
   there is much to be done.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.205
      (suspenseful music)

19:55.695 --> 19:59.764
    Look how obedient you
    are, how eager to serve.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.700
      You will make a fine
      captain for my army.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.803
          - Run away.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.338
 The stories about the Hollows,

20:07.340 --> 20:09.607
    the new bodies they give
    every living creature,

20:09.609 --> 20:10.908
   do you know what they did

20:10.910 --> 20:13.844
     with those mangled by
     their body factory?

20:13.846 --> 20:16.380
    Do you know those places
    you are forbidden to go?

20:22.188 --> 20:23.654
  Come with me and you'll see.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.026
      (suspenseful music)

20:40.039 --> 20:42.006
           (groaning)

20:42.008 --> 20:42.873
            - Hush.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.676
      There, there child.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.417
 - [Elder Pyreez] Elder Masook,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.753
       I came as soon as
       I received word.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.590
    - Elder Pyreez, welcome.

21:01.628 --> 21:05.096
   - News of the moons
   disappearance from the sky

21:05.098 --> 21:07.131
    can only mean one thing.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.533
     If the Hollows escaped
     from their prison,

21:11.537 --> 21:14.438
    I fear they will return
    to their old ways.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.009
     - These are troubling
     times indeed.

21:22.215 --> 21:25.149
      (suspenseful music)

21:25.151 --> 21:26.384
           (panting)

21:26.386 --> 21:28.619
           (screams)

21:31.457 --> 21:33.057
- Easy, just get me to the water

21:33.059 --> 21:34.525
  and everything will be fine.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.228
    Everything will be fine.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.003
       (wings fluttering)

21:46.005 --> 21:48.272
           (groaning)

21:56.549 --> 21:57.882
   They're not after us, yet.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.218
      (suspenseful music)

22:01.220 --> 22:03.387
  They must have been summoned
  by the Hollow Queen.

22:06.793 --> 22:10.428
Great danger is upon us, I
must get to my village quickly.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.399
      (suspenseful music)

22:18.037 --> 22:20.404
        (metal clanging)

22:20.406 --> 22:23.574
      (machinery clicking)

22:30.249 --> 22:31.615
           (groaning)

22:31.617 --> 22:33.784
      (electrical buzzing)

22:33.786 --> 22:36.887
          (screaming)

22:36.889 --> 22:40.024
      (electrical buzzing)

22:54.507 --> 22:56.707
           (panting)

22:59.612 --> 23:02.380
        (peaceful music)

23:04.050 --> 23:06.751
           (groaning)

23:06.753 --> 23:11.822
 Brothers, I'm finally back and
 I have such troubling news.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.624
        Gather everyone.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.992
        - Stop traitor.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.193
           - Traitor?

23:16.195 --> 23:18.229
 I've come to save our people.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.263
          - Your eyes.

23:20.366 --> 23:22.700
  We'll let the elders decide.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.372
      (suspenseful music)

23:28.374 --> 23:31.342
   - Dream the Hidden Forest.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.646
     Place yourselves along
     the lantern path.

23:37.183 --> 23:40.718
      A great many
      secrets wait for you

23:40.720 --> 23:44.121
   in the quiet inner world.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.491
           - Master.

23:48.928 --> 23:49.827
             - Hmm?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.396
 - Apologies for the intrusion.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.432
      Shojun has returned,
      but his eyes.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.734
     You must come and see.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.306
    (Terrapin's chattering)

24:06.145 --> 24:09.847
     - It pains me Shojun,
     but I have no choice.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.584
    The news of the Hollows
    escape has reached us

24:14.921 --> 24:17.521
   and the fact that you
   were there to witness it,

24:18.624 --> 24:20.825
   I cannot help but conclude

24:20.827 --> 24:25.029
 that you have been consorting
 with our old enemy.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.332
  Your own words condemn you.

24:28.334 --> 24:31.101
       - But father, I've
       done no wrong.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.103
  Is bearing witness a crime?

24:33.105 --> 24:37.141
    I was taken prisoner by
    their servant, the Ovis.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.609
     Don't you believe me?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.811
         - Enough lies.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.913
       Look at your eyes.

24:42.915 --> 24:47.184
 They tell us that you are
 more Hollow than Terrapin now.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.222
     What terrible bargain
     have you struck?

24:55.061 --> 24:59.797
    - You have violated
    one of our oldest laws.

24:59.799 --> 25:03.133
       You have aided the
       criminal Hollows.

25:03.135 --> 25:08.205
  Shojun, we strip you of
  your rank as a clan member.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.009
   Your staff will be broken,

25:12.011 --> 25:16.914
as you have broken our laws
and your adopted fathers heart.

25:19.018 --> 25:23.921
      You'll be sent away,
      live as an exile.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.791
        (wood snapping)

25:27.793 --> 25:30.794
       (melancholy music)

25:44.310 --> 25:47.444
      (machinery clicking)

25:53.586 --> 25:56.654
      (suspenseful music)

25:59.725 --> 26:02.326
 (speaking in foreign language)

26:02.328 --> 26:05.229
 - Little one, find us a place
 where they can't follow.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.032
    Like when we played
    hide and seek remember.

26:09.168 --> 26:13.137
 (speaking in foreign language)

26:15.741 --> 26:17.741
      (suspenseful music)

26:17.743 --> 26:21.812
 (singing in foreign language)

26:21.814 --> 26:25.716
      (electrical buzzing)

26:25.718 --> 26:28.052
           (groaning)

26:34.594 --> 26:37.661
      (suspenseful music)

26:50.309 --> 26:52.543
           (panting)

26:56.916 --> 26:59.917
      (suspenseful music)

26:59.919 --> 27:01.218
    - [Shojun Voiceover] Do
    you know what they did

27:01.220 --> 27:03.153
     with those mangled by
     their body factory?

27:04.290 --> 27:07.124
    Do you know those places
    you are forbidden to go?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.360
           (panting)

27:11.664 --> 27:14.732
      (suspenseful music)

27:16.902 --> 27:20.571
    I've lost my clan, they
    no longer believe in me.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.212
        What am I to do?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.414
 My life, this life,
 everything was for my people.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.787
    But now I have nothing.

27:38.257 --> 27:41.258
       (melancholy music)

27:43.129 --> 27:46.030
       (water splashing)

27:53.439 --> 27:55.606
 The Hollows have returned and
 they threaten our world again.

28:02.248 --> 28:06.216
   I must do something, even
   without my clans help.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.254
   They might not know it
   now, but they do need me.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.257
      It would be childish
      to sulk and complain

28:13.259 --> 28:15.592
    when there is such great
    danger in the world.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.730
       - Patchwork girl?

28:25.037 --> 28:28.005
       (melancholy music)

28:43.089 --> 28:44.855
- I have dreamed of this ocean.

28:44.857 --> 28:48.592
 To look at it with these eyes
 and to see you again Shojun.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.263
       - It's so good to
       find you too Nani.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.133
    Though, much has
    changed in a short time.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.335
Now, I'm an exile from my clan.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.770
  It's because of your people

28:59.772 --> 29:01.271
      that I've been cast
      out of my village.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.340
     I want you out of me.

29:03.342 --> 29:07.544
  I don't want these feelings,
  these memories, these eyes.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.715
I want to be what I was before.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.054
- I didn't want this fluttering,
pulsing thing in my chest.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.590
     I didn't try to use
     it to crash the moon.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.059
       Things happen, but
       who can say why?

29:23.929 --> 29:26.930
     One thing I know, it
     doesn't do us any good

29:26.932 --> 29:28.532
   to be angry at each other.

29:29.702 --> 29:32.669
       (melancholy music)

29:35.374 --> 29:36.206
      (heartbeat thudding)

29:36.208 --> 29:37.107
        Do you feel it?

29:39.078 --> 29:41.345
    Beating there, where
    there should be a void.

29:42.748 --> 29:45.182
     A Hollow with a heart,
     it makes no sense.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.253
      (heartbeat thudding)

30:03.335 --> 30:04.768
    - The world is changing.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.305
      The sun sets and I
      hope in the morning

30:08.307 --> 30:10.073
       it will still be
       here to greet us.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.978
  The night sky is lonely now,

30:14.980 --> 30:17.381
       no moon to swim in
       its starry river.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.317
It's death brought your rebirth,

30:20.319 --> 30:22.486
    but it will never again
    be in the heavens.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.023
       Your sisters have
       done so much harm

30:26.025 --> 30:27.491
   when they were last here.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.927
 I only know the stories, but I
 hope we survive their return.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.869
     - I also am too young
     to remember, but I
     cannot abandon you.

30:40.573 --> 30:43.073
     The one whose soul
     is tangled with mine.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.184
      (machinery clicking)

31:00.159 --> 31:02.559
          (screeching)

31:07.867 --> 31:10.934
      (suspenseful music)

31:22.615 --> 31:24.948
           (sniffing)

31:28.754 --> 31:29.620
             Sleep.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.790
      My eyes grow weary.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.193
They tire like something living.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.765
      (suspenseful music)

31:41.767 --> 31:42.666
           (screams)

31:42.668 --> 31:45.535
            (groans)

31:45.537 --> 31:47.704
            (groans)

31:47.706 --> 31:49.539
  - If you want your Terrapin
  ally to live Hollow,

31:49.541 --> 31:52.242
   you better tell me what
   your people are planning.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.411
- Mechanical bodies, like ours,

31:54.413 --> 31:57.180
      are the greatest
      gift we can bestow.

31:57.182 --> 32:00.284
    We will bless the world,
    like our creator P'Torr

32:00.286 --> 32:01.852
    has blessed us long ago.

32:03.856 --> 32:05.822
      - That's the story
      I grew up with too.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.127
   If I release you, you must
   promise not to fight me.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.664
 - I would not have harmed
 you then, and I wouldn't now,

32:13.666 --> 32:15.899
    after you saved my life
    back at the temple.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.778
  - I found the body factory,

32:27.780 --> 32:30.580
      but also something
      much more terrible.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.951
 Not all creatures put through
 the conversion come out right.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.386
   There's a, there's a place
   these mangled unfortunates

32:36.388 --> 32:39.423
   are discarded like pieces
   of misshapen trash.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.758
    - I can't believe this.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.461
    Yari told us that the
    conversions are painless

32:44.463 --> 32:46.396
   and there are no mistakes.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.732
   - [Shojun And Geta] There
   are always mistakes.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.802
      - Come and see with
      your own eyes then.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.182
      - This is too
      terrible for words.

33:06.285 --> 33:10.988
      Did my mother, did
      my sisters do this?

33:12.791 --> 33:16.727
       - You must help us
       stop the Hollows.

33:16.729 --> 33:19.496
       - But without our
       creator P'Torr,

33:19.498 --> 33:22.366
        I fear that Yari
        is too powerful.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.536
 - Especially now that she has
 my people back in her thrall.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.306
      Her army is growing
      bigger by the day.

33:29.308 --> 33:32.843
      She's taking the
      best warriors and...

33:35.047 --> 33:35.946
        - Your brother?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.783
    - There has to be a way.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.085
     There has to be a way,

33:42.087 --> 33:43.854
   the old stories tell
   that P'Torr had a helper.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.458
  Perhaps if we find him,
  he'd know about the Hollows,

33:48.460 --> 33:49.760
    and of their weaknesses.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.730
    - Yes, Lord Geer was his
    servant who he spared

33:53.732 --> 33:56.333
       when he went to
       face the Hollows.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.502
Funny, P'Torr destroyed himself

33:58.504 --> 34:01.371
   but he couldn't bare to do
   the same to his creations.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.740
 He put us on the Prison Moon.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.443
      Lord Geer was
      given a safe haven.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.911
        It's an island,

34:07.913 --> 34:09.980
  I used to see it when my
  moon passed over the ocean.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.516
     - The island with the
     strange high tower?

34:12.518 --> 34:14.251
      I saw it afar on
      many fishing trips,

34:14.253 --> 34:15.585
     I could sail us there.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.389
        (peaceful music)

34:30.202 --> 34:32.436
           (humming)

34:40.779 --> 34:41.678
             - Hmm.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.047
              Hmm.

34:46.819 --> 34:47.717
            Lovely.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.625
   Hmm, I wonder who decided

34:55.627 --> 34:59.129
     they needed to see the
     old fool clockwork?

35:00.632 --> 35:02.432
     I hope it's not Yari.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.804
     I know the moon is
     no longer in the sky,

35:07.806 --> 35:12.275
 so the nasty creature has most
 likely escaped her prison.

35:20.018 --> 35:23.153
      (machinery clicking)

35:26.291 --> 35:27.791
      Could it be master?

35:31.363 --> 35:34.097
        (door clanging)

35:36.668 --> 35:37.868
       No, not possible.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.270
    She would have forgotten
    all about it by now,

35:40.272 --> 35:41.338
      wouldn't she master?

35:43.142 --> 35:44.241
          - Yes Geer.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.076
           Help them.

35:48.413 --> 35:51.381
 - I must prepare for visitors,
 it's been a long time

35:51.383 --> 35:56.019
  and much has changed since
  I last walked among others.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.855
        (metal rattling)

36:00.392 --> 36:01.658
          No, no, no!

36:01.660 --> 36:04.194
    Stay down, stay asleep.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.328
           (laughing)

36:05.330 --> 36:07.731
 Please not now, I have guests.

36:12.137 --> 36:17.207
    - [Yari Voiceover] Lord
    Geer, the time has come.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.709
         Let them rise.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.146
           (laughing)

36:25.617 --> 36:28.451
        (peaceful music)

36:51.210 --> 36:53.176
  - Watch your heads friends.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.479
 This old place wasn't really
 meant for one of your stature.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.450
        (peaceful music)

37:03.655 --> 37:04.521
          (clattering)

37:04.523 --> 37:06.823
           (groaning)

37:08.327 --> 37:11.661
   It has been ages since
   I've entertained visitors.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.529
         - [Shojun] Ow.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.703
           (sniffing)

37:19.705 --> 37:21.238
    - The air smells wrong.

37:22.975 --> 37:25.809
   - This place has certainly
   seen better days.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.512
            (groans)

37:29.514 --> 37:31.848
 - This table's, table's cute.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.221
        - Please, please
        excuse the mess.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.925
        (peaceful music)

37:44.263 --> 37:46.563
           (slurping)

37:55.173 --> 37:57.907
        (metal tapping)

37:59.311 --> 38:01.845
  - So you see why we want to
  continue your masters work.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.681
    The Hollows are still
    as driven and dangerous

38:04.683 --> 38:05.882
      as back in his time.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.137
     And (groans), and you,

38:11.138 --> 38:12.354
      (groans) and you are
      the only one left

38:12.357 --> 38:13.857
who knows something about them.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.326
  Now can we do anything to
  stop their terrible change?

38:17.829 --> 38:22.265
 - Master P'Torr realized all
 too late what he had wrought.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.933
      But even he, he, he.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.772
      (machinery clicking)

38:28.774 --> 38:29.673
        Pard, pardon me.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.209
      But even the master
      could not stop them.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.144
    - [P'Torr] Oh the pain.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.513
 - I'm so sorry, but it's true.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.049
Please, do not be upset with me.

38:42.220 --> 38:46.589
   My master had to call on a
   much more powerful entity.

38:46.591 --> 38:49.059
   So dangerous for mortals.

38:49.061 --> 38:52.762
      An ancient creature
      of the mountains.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.533
  - The mountain God, Y'Gimm.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.635
        - Yes Terrapin.

38:58.637 --> 39:02.706
   To wake the immortal, you
   need to find his heart.

39:02.708 --> 39:06.409
       The white heart of
       the Mountain God.

39:06.411 --> 39:09.012
     If you find it hidden
     deep within the earth,

39:09.014 --> 39:11.181
 you will wake the sleeping God

39:11.183 --> 39:13.883
and stop the Hollows as before.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.218
         - White ship.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.253
          White heart.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.789
       - You speak in
       riddles Lord Geer.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.991
  Tell us, what is this heart?

39:21.993 --> 39:23.126
          Where is it?

39:25.664 --> 39:27.297
      - The heart, rests.

39:32.204 --> 39:35.004
        (metal rattling)

39:36.341 --> 39:39.409
      (suspenseful music)

39:41.713 --> 39:43.646
     - [Soldiers Together]
     Serve the Hollows.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.048
       Serve the Hollows.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.584
       Serve the Hollows.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.988
     - No, no, no, no, no.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.990
           (screams)

39:53.992 --> 39:56.826
           (thudding)

39:56.828 --> 39:58.061
        (chain clinking)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.262
           (groaning)

39:59.264 --> 40:00.997
          (sputtering)

40:00.999 --> 40:02.899
           (groaning)

40:02.901 --> 40:05.368
          (clattering)

40:09.808 --> 40:12.142
           (thudding)

40:13.278 --> 40:16.413
      (suspenseful music)

40:17.682 --> 40:20.817
          (sputtering)

40:20.819 --> 40:23.753
           (groaning)

40:23.755 --> 40:25.855
      (suspenseful music)

40:25.857 --> 40:28.191
           (groaning)

40:30.328 --> 40:32.462
            (groans)

40:38.937 --> 40:39.769
           (groaning)

40:39.771 --> 40:42.205
          (clattering)

40:44.743 --> 40:47.744
        (bones cracking)

40:47.746 --> 40:49.546
           (groaning)

40:49.548 --> 40:50.814
        No, no, no, no.

40:51.883 --> 40:52.949
           Stay away.

40:52.951 --> 40:53.817
              No.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.854
           Get back.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.656
         (metal clinks)

40:59.658 --> 41:01.424
           (growling)

41:01.426 --> 41:03.259
      (suspenseful music)

41:03.261 --> 41:05.595
           (groaning)

41:07.532 --> 41:09.933
          (screaming)

41:17.275 --> 41:19.476
      (machinery clicking)

41:19.478 --> 41:22.111
  - Forgive me, do forgive me.

41:22.113 --> 41:25.448
       Yari embedded her
       will in my gears.

41:25.450 --> 41:30.153
I, I could not dis, disobey her.

41:34.626 --> 41:38.228
 Master, I am weak without you.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.934
   - Madness, sheer madness!

41:44.936 --> 41:47.370
          (clattering)

41:50.408 --> 41:53.743
     She's slaughtering
     them, imprisoning
     them in living metal.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.548
   I left my old world
   because of the wars there,

41:58.550 --> 42:00.283
   how can Yari, my creation,

42:01.620 --> 42:04.854
      my daughter commit
      such horrible acts?

42:08.660 --> 42:11.194
- Master, she took your actions

42:11.196 --> 42:13.963
      and twisted them
      into her dark mind.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.368
    She saw you giving life
    to your new automator

42:19.437 --> 42:21.538
    and in her arrogance
    thought to do the same.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.275
  Only she tries giving it to
  those who do not need it.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.019
      - This cannot go on.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.422
   I will end it here, today.

42:39.424 --> 42:41.157
      - No, no you cannot.

42:45.730 --> 42:46.629
             Stop.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.831
  - What, what are you doing?

42:50.035 --> 42:50.900
        Geer, stop this.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.203
       I am your master.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.707
     I command you to stop!

42:57.709 --> 42:59.309
           (thudding)

42:59.311 --> 43:00.877
Has the madness seized you too?

43:06.918 --> 43:08.985
            (sighs)

43:11.923 --> 43:15.191
       (melancholy music)

43:15.193 --> 43:18.595
    (hover board whooshing)

43:25.570 --> 43:28.671
    Geer, you have served
    me well all these years

43:28.673 --> 43:30.273
 but it is time for you to go.

43:37.015 --> 43:39.916
      My faithful servant,
      you are free.

43:50.929 --> 43:54.330
    (hover board whooshing)

43:58.803 --> 43:59.836
          - M, master.

44:21.026 --> 44:24.761
      (suspenseful music)

44:24.763 --> 44:26.729
     - [Soldiers Together]
     Serve the Hollows.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.831
       Serve the Hollows.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.667
       Serve the Hollows.

44:30.669 --> 44:32.235
       Serve the Hollows.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.804
       Serve the Hollows.

44:34.806 --> 44:37.040
       Serve the Hollows.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.275
            (groans)

44:40.879 --> 44:41.744
      (electrical buzzing)

44:41.746 --> 44:44.147
          (screaming)

44:48.586 --> 44:49.519
            (laughs)

44:49.521 --> 44:51.854
           (groaning)

44:54.359 --> 44:57.260
        (metal thudding)

44:57.262 --> 45:00.396
      (suspenseful music)

45:03.501 --> 45:05.568
            (gasps)

45:07.172 --> 45:08.738
       Serve the Hollows.

45:09.908 --> 45:11.274
            (groans)

45:11.276 --> 45:12.675
        - [Nani] Shojun!

45:18.083 --> 45:21.150
     - [Soldiers Together]
     Serve the Hollows.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.719
       Serve the Hollows.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.287
       Serve the Hollows.

45:25.557 --> 45:28.091
      (suspenseful music)

45:28.093 --> 45:28.925

45:32.764 --> 45:34.497

45:34.499 --> 45:36.065
       Serve the Hollows.

45:37.302 --> 45:40.203
       (water splashing)

45:45.510 --> 45:48.177
         (metal clangs)

45:49.981 --> 45:52.849
      (suspenseful music)

45:52.851 --> 45:54.984
       Serve the Hollows.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.919
       Serve the Hollows.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.488
       Serve the Hollows.

46:05.296 --> 46:08.598
 - These old soldiers have
 been hibernating for too long.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.633
 It has scrambled their minds.

46:10.635 --> 46:14.604
 Their over-zealousness for
 combat has cost me my daughter

46:14.606 --> 46:17.507
  and that, that is not good.

46:17.509 --> 46:20.977
    You were supposed to
    bring her to me, intact.

46:25.150 --> 46:27.884
       Ah, the Ovis woman
       we've captured,

46:27.886 --> 46:29.519
  she's your sister isn't she?

46:30.622 --> 46:34.857
      - But to serve, we
      must abandon family.

46:34.859 --> 46:36.359
      We cannot look back.

46:39.297 --> 46:42.098
    - Oh, don't be so quick
    to dismiss family ties.

46:42.100 --> 46:45.535
     After all our service
     is to protect.

46:45.537 --> 46:48.871
Don't you wish to protect those
who are closest to you Brujt?

46:51.342 --> 46:54.343
  - As you wish Goddess Yari,
  you know what is best.

46:54.345 --> 46:56.112
You care about the entire world

46:56.915 --> 46:58.781
 as if it were your own child.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.018
       - True my captain,

47:02.020 --> 47:05.454
  but isn't it remarkable how
  caring for the entire world

47:05.456 --> 47:08.724
      makes you lose those
      you love sometimes.

47:08.726 --> 47:11.127
  Do not repeat this mistake.

47:11.129 --> 47:12.995
       Go to your sister.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.364
      - But I don't under-

47:17.302 --> 47:19.268
  Yes my Goddess, as you wish.

47:20.138 --> 47:23.272
      (machinery clicking)

47:25.276 --> 47:28.344
      (suspenseful music)

47:36.888 --> 47:40.156
       - My child, have I
       lost you for good?

47:41.492 --> 47:45.161
    Have I lost you just as
    I reclaimed the world?

47:48.433 --> 47:50.666
           (sobbing)

48:00.211 --> 48:02.712
         (door clangs)

48:03.615 --> 48:07.283
      (machinery clicking)

48:07.285 --> 48:10.086
      - Why lay there
      broken and defeated?

48:10.088 --> 48:11.454
         Come on child.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.291
      The conversion
      gives one new life,

48:15.293 --> 48:18.694
     just like the stories
     told us remember?

48:18.696 --> 48:20.830
     Just like we imagined
     when we were children,

48:20.832 --> 48:23.633
 it's the dream of every Ovis.

48:23.635 --> 48:24.867
       It is what we do.

48:24.869 --> 48:26.135
  We serve the great Goddesses

48:26.137 --> 48:29.672
       to save the flawed
       world from itself.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.842
   A new body will protect
   you from the soot storms,

48:32.844 --> 48:36.112
     and a new body, new
     life, let me help you.

48:36.114 --> 48:39.015
    Like our mother told
    me to, I am your elder.

48:39.017 --> 48:40.783
       I look after you.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.151
   - You are not my brother.

48:43.221 --> 48:45.554
       You are a shade of
       who he once was.

48:47.825 --> 48:50.059
           (sobbing)

48:55.133 --> 48:58.301
      (machinery clicking)

49:01.105 --> 49:04.073
       (melancholy music)

49:11.516 --> 49:15.384
 - (sighs) I cannot defy Yari.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.722
     - How about this one?

49:19.724 --> 49:20.790
          You like it?

49:21.859 --> 49:23.526
      How about this one?

49:26.798 --> 49:27.797
         This might do.

49:29.600 --> 49:32.068
      How about this one,
      it's nice right?

49:32.070 --> 49:33.336
             - No.

49:33.338 --> 49:35.771
 It's so terrible and twisted.

49:35.773 --> 49:37.740
       And I feel another
       spirit within it,

49:37.742 --> 49:39.709
  just like in all the others.

49:39.711 --> 49:41.477
       - These creatures
       are still alive?

49:42.847 --> 49:44.480
          - Not alive.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.082
  I don't know what they are.

49:47.385 --> 49:50.086
 It's some terrible half
 existence I don't understand,

49:50.088 --> 49:52.521
       but I can't abide.

49:52.523 --> 49:55.658
     How could my sisters,
     how could Yari,

49:55.660 --> 49:59.095
  the one who constructed
  me, let these creatures rot

49:59.097 --> 50:01.797
   while a spark of
   awareness still flutters?

50:02.667 --> 50:05.568
     What cruelty is this?

50:05.570 --> 50:07.370
- Forgive me for following you,

50:07.372 --> 50:10.339
      but I couldn't help
      but feel responsible

50:10.341 --> 50:13.576
  for your bodies destruction
  dear Hollow Sister.

50:13.578 --> 50:16.345
   But I am a gifted mechanic

50:16.347 --> 50:18.748
       perhaps, perhaps
       I could help you?

50:19.984 --> 50:21.984
      - I don't trust you.

50:21.986 --> 50:24.487
    When we met you betrayed
    us to the Hollows.

50:24.489 --> 50:27.623
   - And it was a m, mistake.

50:27.625 --> 50:30.559
    I only sought peace and
    quiet and then the Yari,

50:30.561 --> 50:35.197
     the Hollow Queen, re,
     returned to my mind.

50:35.199 --> 50:39.001
    I was not in control of
    myself or my actions.

50:39.003 --> 50:41.237
    - Then I have every
    reason to doubt you now.

50:42.273 --> 50:44.673
     - I mean only to help.

50:44.675 --> 50:47.843
  And besides, do you even
  know how to build a Hollow?

50:47.845 --> 50:50.279
     I stood by my masters
     side for years,

50:50.281 --> 50:52.715
making his mechanical children.

50:52.717 --> 50:56.018
      And my master
      guides me, even now.

50:57.355 --> 51:01.123
   - Shojun, perhaps we
   should consider his offer.

51:02.393 --> 51:03.793
      - I don't trust him.

51:03.795 --> 51:05.995
         But, for now.

51:07.565 --> 51:11.700
 Okay Clockwork, show us you
 can make a new body for Nani.

51:13.104 --> 51:15.704
   And remember I'm standing
   here with weapon in hand.

51:18.076 --> 51:21.077
       (wings fluttering)

51:26.651 --> 51:28.751
        - There you are.

51:28.753 --> 51:31.353
     That old useless fool.

51:31.355 --> 51:33.155
       Still he toys with
       disobeying me.

51:34.559 --> 51:37.293
        (tool whirring)

51:39.030 --> 51:39.995
          - No please.

51:39.997 --> 51:42.465
 - You need someone to follow.

51:42.467 --> 51:43.933
            (laughs)

51:43.935 --> 51:44.800
             - No!

52:01.085 --> 52:03.819
        (tool whirring)

52:07.725 --> 52:12.228
Terrapin, you may want to know,
your people are in danger.

52:13.331 --> 52:14.797
         - What danger?

52:14.799 --> 52:17.566
  - Yari and the Ovis are
  closing in on your village.

52:18.469 --> 52:19.468
       - How do you know?

52:20.938 --> 52:22.204
    - Let me share a secret.

52:23.908 --> 52:26.142
When I was linked to the Queen,

52:26.144 --> 52:28.043
      it did not run in
      just one direction.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.113
  I saw what she was planning.

52:34.185 --> 52:35.317
 - Then I'll leave right away.

52:35.319 --> 52:36.218
             - No.

52:37.522 --> 52:40.823
    - I will come with you,
    perhaps I can help.

52:40.825 --> 52:43.726
  - No, you seem to mean
  well, but I can't trust you.

52:44.529 --> 52:46.629
Stay here and build Nani's body.

52:46.631 --> 52:48.797
  It could be a trap or a lie,

52:50.234 --> 52:52.401
     but I can't take the
     chance of being wrong.

52:59.777 --> 53:02.478
        (tool whirring)

53:07.251 --> 53:10.152
       (heavy breathing)

53:14.592 --> 53:17.259
- You're a cloud breather, yes?

53:19.497 --> 53:22.998
     - (exhales) That I be.

53:23.000 --> 53:23.465
       - Can you generate
       clouds in here?

53:27.038 --> 53:31.941
   - How would that help us?

53:32.643 --> 53:37.246
 - I'm a conjurer, I can
 tickle sprites from the mist.

53:37.248 --> 53:38.647
   I think they can free us.

53:41.719 --> 53:42.952
         - As you wish.

53:46.023 --> 53:48.324
           (exhaling)

53:57.902 --> 54:00.803
       (sprites moaning)

54:02.740 --> 54:05.040
           (exhaling)

54:10.948 --> 54:13.782
        (peaceful music)

54:20.424 --> 54:22.191
      (suspenseful music)

54:22.193 --> 54:25.160
       (wings fluttering)

54:45.616 --> 54:46.515
             - Huh?

54:50.988 --> 54:53.222
           (screams)

55:06.570 --> 55:08.470
         (staff thuds)

55:08.472 --> 55:10.673
          (screaming)

55:10.675 --> 55:13.509
        (dramatic music)

55:15.212 --> 55:17.546
           (groaning)

55:20.851 --> 55:22.251
   - I pray I'm not too late.

55:22.253 --> 55:24.320
       - Even then, what
       can you do alone?

55:24.322 --> 55:26.155
      - Hush dear friend,
      this is my fight.

55:26.157 --> 55:28.557
       I'd rather die
       protecting my home

55:28.559 --> 55:29.625
   than live exiled from it.

55:30.661 --> 55:32.094
     For your safety Nani.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.165
          (screaming)

55:36.167 --> 55:37.533
      (suspenseful music)

55:37.535 --> 55:39.835
           (groaning)

55:44.542 --> 55:47.042
          (scratching)

55:48.946 --> 55:51.080
            (groans)

55:52.550 --> 55:54.850
           (groaning)

55:56.620 --> 55:58.020
      (suspenseful music)

55:58.022 --> 55:59.588
           - Warrior.

55:59.590 --> 56:03.225
 Though you may be a skilled
 warrior among your own people,

56:03.227 --> 56:06.061
    your moves are slowed by
    the metal and mechanics

56:06.063 --> 56:07.563
       you have adopted.

56:07.565 --> 56:10.199
   - Let's hear your prattle
   when I skewer you, toad.

56:11.268 --> 56:12.935
            (groans)

56:12.937 --> 56:14.002
    - [Elder Masook] Sloppy.

56:20.678 --> 56:21.877
    - We're not alone Nani,

56:22.880 --> 56:24.546
and look it's Geta with friends.

56:25.549 --> 56:28.083
           (screams)

56:28.085 --> 56:30.753
           (groaning)

56:30.755 --> 56:33.055
           (thudding)

56:34.592 --> 56:37.259
           (screams)

56:37.261 --> 56:40.329
      (suspenseful music)

56:40.331 --> 56:42.464
           (groaning)

56:42.466 --> 56:44.867
          (screaming)

56:47.004 --> 56:49.338
           (groaning)

56:50.574 --> 56:53.742
      (machinery clicking)

56:56.347 --> 56:58.647
      (suspenseful music)

56:58.649 --> 57:00.082
           (thudding)

57:00.084 --> 57:02.317
           (groaning)

57:09.360 --> 57:11.093
         - Give up yet?

57:11.095 --> 57:13.095
            (laughs)

57:13.097 --> 57:15.397
           (groaning)

57:18.469 --> 57:20.536
  - We'll see who's slow now?

57:22.606 --> 57:25.340
        (bone cracking)

57:26.677 --> 57:28.410
           (screams)

57:28.412 --> 57:30.712
           (groaning)

57:31.482 --> 57:33.248
         - See brother.

57:34.385 --> 57:36.385
      Relatives are
      harder to hide from,

57:38.189 --> 57:40.722
  but you won't die this day.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.059
           (groaning)

57:44.061 --> 57:46.061
      (electrical buzzing)

57:46.063 --> 57:47.329
           (groaning)

57:47.331 --> 57:49.531
           (thudding)

57:49.533 --> 57:52.601
      (suspenseful music)

57:54.138 --> 57:55.037
           - Father.

57:56.173 --> 57:57.005
           (screams)

57:57.007 --> 57:58.073
     I see you've met Geta.

57:58.742 --> 58:01.076
           (groaning)

58:01.078 --> 58:03.712
   - It's good to see some
   Ovis who haven't gone mad.

58:05.182 --> 58:08.250
      (suspenseful music)

58:13.791 --> 58:16.091
           (groaning)

58:17.661 --> 58:19.962
           (thudding)

58:23.434 --> 58:26.401
       (wings fluttering)

58:31.675 --> 58:33.809
           (groaning)

58:33.811 --> 58:36.545
           (screams)

58:36.547 --> 58:38.847
           (groaning)

58:41.452 --> 58:43.318
       (blood squelches)

58:43.320 --> 58:44.786
           (groaning)

58:44.788 --> 58:47.022
           (screams)

58:48.192 --> 58:50.492
           (groaning)

58:55.699 --> 58:58.233
          (gas hisses)

58:58.235 --> 59:00.569
           (groaning)

59:02.473 --> 59:04.806
        Take to the air.

59:04.808 --> 59:07.109
           (groaning)

59:11.348 --> 59:14.149
        (peaceful music)

59:15.152 --> 59:17.452
           (groaning)

59:18.255 --> 59:19.221
          - Look out!

59:20.057 --> 59:21.690
       Um, wait a second.

59:21.692 --> 59:24.026
           (groaning)

59:25.496 --> 59:27.796
           (thudding)

59:35.506 --> 59:38.640
      (machinery clicking)

59:40.644 --> 59:42.978
- What a fine prize we've found.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.713
      Destroy them hound.

59:47.351 --> 59:49.952
        (metal thudding)

59:49.954 --> 59:51.086
        (dramatic music)

59:51.088 --> 59:53.388
           (groaning)

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.262
           (groaning)

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.635
           (screams)

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:13.008
           (groaning)

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:18.547
        (metal clanging)

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:22.484
      (machinery whirring)

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:27.022
            (groans)

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:29.391
      (suspenseful music)

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:32.561
      (machinery clicking)

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.671
           (groaning)

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:43.538
           - Shojun!

01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:47.275
- I'll deal with you next witch.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:51.713
      (machinery clicking)

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:55.317
            (groans)

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:01.156
           (groaning)

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:09.431
            (groans)

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.136
- A taste of the Hidden Forest.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:19.074
           (groaning)

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.942
          (gas hisses)

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:24.012
      (suspenseful music)

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.727
       - You and your
       idealism Terrapin.

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:41.196
    Let it continue to take
    you down the wrong path.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:45.033
       Look, you see that
       Hollows offer?

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.902
Protection from the killer soot.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.739
     Warrior, how long can
     you keep this up?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:58.046
           (groaning)

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:58.914
             Hi ya.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.783
            (groans)

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:03.819
   Ooh, you're on the ground.

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.487
       Oh, we could help.

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:08.056
      Join us and then we
      can take this battle

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:12.527
    to the Tricksters above,
    the real villains.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:13.995
     Let me be your refuge.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.331
- Not for the sacrifice you ask.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:20.168
   - (laughs) Run and see
   if it solves the problem.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:23.338
 Let the soot consume you then.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.274
     We will return to pick
     through your remains.

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:29.177
       (water splashing)

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:32.481
             Hi ya!

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:36.485
        (water bubbling)

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:51.099
         (eerie music)

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.181
       (melancholy music)

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:46.154
        (water splashes)

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:50.892
         - I am sorry.

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:56.031
     Your father, he's
     been calling for you.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.974
       (melancholy music)

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.189
       - Father, father.

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:23.024
           I'm sorry.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:23.925
        I came too late.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.229
      - Hush, foolish boy.

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:31.900
      It is not your fault
      you were cast away.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:38.974
    If we, if I, hadn't made
    that terrible decision

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:42.677
   you would have been here
   with us where you belong.

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:45.013
  It is I who should be sorry.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:47.549
    I am old enough to know

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:53.822
   that the law should be
   seen through loving eyes.

01:04:53.824 --> 01:04:54.723
          Forgive me.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.227
   - No, no, no, there's
   nothing to forgive father.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.663
And you mustn't regret anything.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:06.334
 - You fought so bravely today.

01:05:07.838 --> 01:05:11.506
     I know that you never
     abandoned your people.

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:15.810
       (melancholy music)

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:26.054
       Take this my son.

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:29.324
   It will be of use to you.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:36.965
  Made in the blood of diamond
  stones, it cannot be broken.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:42.938
   It will obey your command.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.674
       - I will not fail
       your trust in me.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:51.246
       - Now, the Hidden
       Forest beckons me.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:06:00.555
   Lead my son, with wisdom.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:09.631
        - Sleep father.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.234
          Travel well.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.605
       (melancholy music)

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:52.173
      (machinery clicking)

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.408
   - [Elder Masook Voiceover]
   I see the treetops

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.744
       as I approach the
       one tree itself.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:59.347
It's great bowels welcoming me.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:04.119
     The sky glitters a
     million eternal stars.

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:08.256
 The Hidden Forest beckons me.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.894
       (melancholy music)

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:20.168
           (groaning)

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:23.138
       (blood squelching)

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:33.782
     - Don't worry Nani, we
     will find you a body.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:37.585
      For now, you and I
      will travel as one.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.890
     You will be my
     sister, my other eyes.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.093
       - And you will be
       my other heart.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.263
     - We're still too few.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.865
     We must stop Yari
     from raising her army.

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:53.134
       - The Hollows were
       not born villains,

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.336
they were twisted to become that

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.305
    in their battle
    against the Tricksters.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:07:59.307
  Maybe we can reverse things.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.209
       Remember the heart
       of the mountain?

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.311
    Let's seek the heart and
    hope it gives us answers

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:04.813
  that are better than death.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:09.984
  - I know where to find the
  white heart of the mountain.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.689
      - Goddess, we have
      taken the prisoners

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:15.990
   and begun the conversion.

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:19.627
  You will soon have more
  soldiers for the war ahead.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.764
   - Very good my one Brujt.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.167
            Tell me.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:29.804
         - Yes Goddess.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:34.142
     - Why do they continue
     to resist me so?

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:36.544
     When I offer them the
     gift of protection

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:40.215
   from the soot storms, why
   do they continue to rebel?

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.350
 We offer them life over death.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.254
        - I cannot say.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.323
 - But their days are numbered.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:52.627
  With each moment our ranks
  grow stronger and stronger,

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.295
        theirs dwindle.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:57.465
  Surely they will understand
  and come to side with us

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.867
        before the end?

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:02.604
      - It is the way of
      progress my Goddess.

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:17.085
      - Shojun, you
      better come with me.

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:18.819
   The rest of you wait here.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.156
   - Keep watch my brothers.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:22.924
      Raise the alarm if
      the Hollows arrive.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.330
      - I know this ship.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.466
      From Yari's stories.

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:33.902
     This is P'Torr's ship.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:36.371
      Didn't he die here?

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.404
             - Hmm?

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:40.108
  Come, there is more inside.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:58.393
      (suspenseful music)

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.852
             - Huh?

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:28.156
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we
  shouldn't disturb the dead.

01:10:28.158 --> 01:10:30.491
 - I am not afraid of the dead.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:33.228
    If the dead could speak,
    we would simply ask.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.097
      But since he can't.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.570
  This one has left us a gift.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:07.562
         - By the Gods!

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:08.663
           - It fits.

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:14.202
      (machinery clicking)

01:11:14.204 --> 01:11:15.470
        It feels right.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:19.507
      I feel like, myself.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:31.219
     (machinery squeaking)

01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:33.588
   At last, I can move again.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.524
        Even dance, see.

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:38.926
      - There will be time
      for dancing later.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.428
  Help me with these controls,

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.930
 I do not know these letters
 and none of this makes sense.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.766
  - I think I can decipher it.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:47.135
   This dial here, it
   controls this power source

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:49.504
    and it seems to reach
    deep into the mountain.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:52.273
   Legends make it all sound
   like magic, but it's not.

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.841
      This works by
      remotely controlling

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:56.778
 the flow of geothermal heat
 in the depths of the mountain.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.547
 I think P'Torr had used this
 power to awaken the creature.

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:00.815
 It's connected to the mountain

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.317
   and the changes within it

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.319
   can either waken him or
   keep him in deep slumber,

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.887
     like this ship has
     been this whole time,

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:08.256
       ever since our
       exile to the moon.

01:12:08.258 --> 01:12:11.559
   - I see you find the white
   heart, the exiles ship.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:17.598
  I had to follow you, to tell
  you I have freed myself.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.568
     And to see you
     discover your destiny.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:21.736
          - Stay away.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:24.238
      Stay away, you
      wretched Clockwork.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:28.676
    - I truly wish to help.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:33.581
I realize you have your reasons
to, to doubt my sincerity,

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:39.554
 but I assure you, I carry a
 deep shame about my betrayal,

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.690
       however unwilling.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:47.762
  I w, wish only to prove to
  you that I speak the truth.

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:51.532
          I can help.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:55.837
  I came here meaning to carry
  out P'Torr's last wish,

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:58.539
  to awaken the Mountain God,

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.875
 to silence the Hollow threat.

01:13:02.312 --> 01:13:04.879
    - How can we know you're
    not lying to us again?

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.781
 Following my mother's orders.

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:13.287
   - Let me do this one last
   thing, you shall see.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:17.792
   Let me stand by your side
   and wake the Mountain God.

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:21.329
      - I say let him try.

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:24.799
    We're all former enemies
    joined in alliance,

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.801
       couldn't any of us
       betray the rest?

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:30.371
      This is why we came
      here after all.

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:33.574
  - But we'll need to ensure
  the Hollows won't interrupt.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.610
  - It's up to us then Shojun.

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.679
   Let Nani and old Tick
   Tock try and wake the God

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:41.282
    and the rest of us will
    distract the Hollows.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.485
         - Attack them.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.989
    - You said so yourself.

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.857
  It will likely be dangerous.

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:52.760
And we are warriors are we not?

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.763
 Who knows we may succeed and,

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.199
 and I may get my brother back.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:04.472
         - Then we go.

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:14.315
       (melancholy music)

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:18.419
     Nani, I don't know if
     I'll be coming back.

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:20.321
- Please don't speak like this.

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:21.823
     Surely you'll return.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:25.159
       We've been through
       so much already

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.762
    and I feel like we will
    see each other again.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.070
     - You are a part of me

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:39.373
      and knowing you has
      changed who I am.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:47.081
   I thank the Gods for that.

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:59.460
  May we meet again Patchwork
  Girl from the moon.

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.463
            (laughs)

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:13.207
      (suspenseful music)

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:14.575
 (speaking in foreign language)

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:16.043
     - Where have you been?

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:18.012
    - Look look, look look.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:22.583
  - [Geta] Warriors, oh you've
  done well little friend.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.255
      - Now, now we have a
      small army (laughs).

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:31.792
      (suspenseful music)

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:38.399
          (screaming)

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.735
           (groaning)

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:47.308
        (metal clinking)

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:55.583
           (thudding)

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:03.124
      (suspenseful music)

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:09.397
          - Lord Geer.

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:14.869
         - No, no, no!

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:18.573
     - Enough Lord Geer,
     as you call yourself.

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:23.044
    You are lord of nothing
    but weakness, cowardice.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.882
   Even though we were made
   by the same set of hands,

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:30.384
  I am stronger than you are.

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:32.687
  You need someone to follow.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:35.222
      - I came to talk to
      you, as an equal.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:38.326
 - It is a deep urge isn't it?

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:40.828
You still want someone to obey.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:41.662
          - No please.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:43.664
      - So be it, obey me.

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:45.733
      Yari of the Hollows.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:49.303
           (laughing)

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.906
  - [Yari And Lord Geer] My
  precious daughter, my child,

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:53.574
     why have you strayed?

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.011
    - Mother how could you?

01:16:57.013 --> 01:17:00.281
    You told me that you
    cared about this world.

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:01.515
  - [Yari And Lord Geer] I do.

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:04.151
       You only need to
       come back and see.

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:06.354
      - Come back and all
      will be forgiven.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:09.323
       - [Yari And Lord
       Geer] I need you,

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.626
for the greater war ahead of us.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:12.994
    Against the Tricksters.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:17.398
  - Not in a thousand
  years, I will not join you.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.399
      Haven't you learned?

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.468
 Your wars have solved nothing.

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:24.105
  I've learned by living among
  the creatures of this world.

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:25.706
       They would choose
       freedom and life

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:28.676
    even with its suffering,
    to protection from harm

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.846
     and an eternal life of
     loyalty to a master.

01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:33.681
       They would suffer
       the soot storms

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:36.150
 instead of being slaves to us.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.351
     - What does it matter

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:39.920
    what those incapable
    of reason would choose?

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.355
         They need us.

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:46.127
  - Oh mother, please release
  the poor old Clockwork.

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.796
      (suspenseful music)

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.498
         - No tomorrow!

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.800
           (groaning)

01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:56.937
      (electrical buzzing)

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:59.273
           (groaning)

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.476
           (screams)

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:08.349
           (groaning)

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:11.419
      (suspenseful music)

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:24.298
           (groaning)

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.534
           (screams)

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:31.806
      (machinery clicking)

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:34.108
           (groaning)

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:40.815
        (metal clanging)

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:43.117
           (groaning)

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:48.155
             - Oh.

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:52.193
      (machinery clicking)

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:55.963
    - Resist her Geer, free
    your mind from her.

01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:01.102
  - Master, you've come back.

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:05.206
- Move Geer, finish the mission.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:09.009
- Quickly, she's too distracted
now to keep her hold on me.

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:10.678
     But that may not last.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.682
      (machinery clicking)

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:17.251
         (gas hissing)

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.824
       (ground rumbling)

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.332
      (suspenseful music)

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.667
           (growling)

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:39.340
      (machinery clicking)

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:42.309
       (machine whirring)

01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:50.184
      (suspenseful music)

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.419
           (thudding)

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:55.222
        (fire crackling)

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:58.225
            (growls)

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.196
      (suspenseful music)

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.214
           (roaring)

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:32.092
       (ground thudding)

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:01.856
        (rocks thudding)

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:04.091
           (roaring)

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.598
           (groaning)

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:20.708
       - Curse you Geer.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:22.443
             Brujt!

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:28.249
           (groaning)

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:29.483
       My loyal captain.

01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:31.151
       Take care of these
       pesky Terrapin,

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:33.354
    I must address the
    greatest danger of all.

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:39.360
           (groaning)

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:45.032
       (ground thudding)

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:54.341
           (screams)

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:56.543
           (roaring)

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:02.950
 I have stood up to my creator

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:05.552
     and I will stand up
     to you mountain giant.

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:07.721
     You will not stop me,

01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:10.925
      I will defeat you or
      be crushed trying.

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:14.061
       But I will not be
       imprisoned again.

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.398
      (electrical buzzing)

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.733
           (growling)

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:24.004
            - Oh no.

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:26.507
      I can see through
      your mother's eyes.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:32.246
  The Mountain God has
  awoken and it's a disaster.

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:35.249
      - What's happening?

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.650
   Geer, what are you saying?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.688
          (screaming)

01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:43.857
      (electrical buzzing)

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:48.996
          (screaming)

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.164
    - He will wipe this
    world clean of all life

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:52.199
   if he continues like this.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:54.301
     Oh, what have I done.

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:57.471
           (growling)

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:01.308
      (suspenseful music)

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.611
        (metal scraping)

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:06.847
           (roaring)

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:20.527
             - Ya.

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:26.000
          (screaming)

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:30.404
           (screams)

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:31.305
            - Yari!

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:43.717
          - Lord Geer?

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.953
           (roaring)

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:55.596
     Mother, I wish it
     didn't end like this.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:23:59.333
      (suspenseful music)

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:01.602
           (groaning)

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:15.382
           (groaning)

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:20.154
           (groaning)

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:23.323
           (thudding)

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:28.195
      (suspenseful music)

01:24:28.197 --> 01:24:30.898
      (machinery clicking)

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.233
           (groaning)

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.609
    - Brother, I beg of you.

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:47.481
    Recognize me, recognize
    that we are one.

01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:52.119
      Doesn't it hurt you?

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:53.153
      Doesn't it hurt you

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:59.626
      to see my blood,
      our people's blood?

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.499
     - What have I become?

01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:08.402
       I am more machine
       than flesh now.

01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:14.174
      What have I become?

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:25.385
        Geta, my sister.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:30.257
      - Brujt, my brother.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.535
      (machinery clicking)

01:25:49.578 --> 01:25:52.045
      (suspenseful music)

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:54.848
        (rocks rumbling)

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:58.986
            (groans)

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:08.762
       - I don't think we
       can fight Y'Gimm.

01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:11.732
       Follow me, Brujt,
       no more fighting.

01:26:12.568 --> 01:26:14.501
       Now it's survival.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:15.402
             Reach.

01:26:17.139 --> 01:26:20.307
      (machinery clicking)

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:26.113
   - I guess the legends
   never tell the full truth.

01:26:26.115 --> 01:26:29.216
    They are half understood
    whispers of the past.

01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:33.720
    The so called God is too
    dangerous a solution,

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:37.491
     there is no one left
     to stop him except me.

01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:39.860
   Am I no better than Yari?

01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:42.796
      Seeking a cure worse
      than the disease?

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:49.169
      (machinery clicking)

01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.979
      (suspenseful music)

01:27:02.618 --> 01:27:03.850
         - Let me help.

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:26.440
      (machinery whirring)

01:27:28.377 --> 01:27:31.445
      (suspenseful music)

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:40.387
     (spaceship whooshing)

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:47.194
      (machinery clicking)

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:52.666
     (spaceship whooshing)

01:28:17.126 --> 01:28:20.360
       (water splashing)

01:28:20.362 --> 01:28:23.430
      (suspenseful music)

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:45.319
        (rock cracking)

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:51.124
            Master.

01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:53.360
            Master.

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.731
- Rest friend, you've done well.

01:28:57.733 --> 01:29:00.767
    The madness, it's over.

01:29:01.637 --> 01:29:04.471
        (peaceful music)

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.728
         (rock tapping)

01:29:47.282 --> 01:29:50.684
    (hover board whooshing)

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:56.256
        (peaceful music)

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:16.009
      (machinery clicking)

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:20.914
      (machinery whirring)

01:30:26.989 --> 01:30:28.855
        - [Shojun] Nani!

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:30.123
           - Shojun!

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.959
       - You're alive and
       you have a mouth.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.963
    - Call it my happy scar.

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:42.803
    I know she was so wrong,

01:30:42.805 --> 01:30:44.938
      and yet I can't help
      but grieve for her.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.974
           My mother.

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:51.178
 I wonder if there was anything

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.712
       anyone could have
       done to help her?

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:55.682
     Couldn't she be saved?

01:30:58.454 --> 01:31:01.655
      (machinery clicking)

01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:07.060
           (groaning)

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.796
        (rock smashing)

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:24.945
       (melancholy music)

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:55.475
   This is the original Yari,

01:31:55.477 --> 01:31:58.512
she's the one that came with
the exile from the other world.

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:04.851
    - You're going to try
    to save her, aren't you?

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:08.021
            - Mommy.

01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:13.260
         - No, sister.

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.635
      (machinery clicking)

01:32:29.511 --> 01:32:32.312
        (peaceful music)

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:38.618
         - Here you go.

01:32:40.489 --> 01:32:41.388
          You try it.

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:43.857
            A ball.

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:54.734
         (dog barking)

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:55.602
              Oh.

01:32:56.538 --> 01:32:59.072
         (dog barking)

01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:17.958
      (machinery clicking)

01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:23.129
         (dog barking)

01:33:28.537 --> 01:33:30.670
      - The time has
      come to start over.

01:33:32.074 --> 01:33:33.306
    This is where we begin.

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:38.778
        (peaceful music)

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.181
 - [P'Torr Voiceover] Children
 of the earth make a home

01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:43.083
 with descendants of the stars.

01:33:43.085 --> 01:33:47.153
     Defying the rules and
     alliances of the past.

01:33:47.155 --> 01:33:49.556
    Strange miracles abound.

01:33:49.558 --> 01:33:53.360
 Hope grows and Yamasong heals.

01:33:55.597 --> 01:33:58.431
        (peaceful music)

01:34:00.836 --> 01:34:03.803
       (wings fluttering)

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.972
        (peaceful music)

01:35:35.664 --> 01:35:37.731
               ¶

01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:31.284
      (suspenseful music)
