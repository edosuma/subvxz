WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.267
Oi, oi! we're back!

00:13.833 --> 00:16.767
Get me back in that house.
Ahh!

00:16.833 --> 00:18.867
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.133
Oh. My. God.

00:25.767 --> 00:28.467
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in me
knickers.

00:35.067 --> 00:38.500
Last time, me and Marty were
more complicated than ever.

00:38.567 --> 00:41.233
Scotty and Marty won't be
returning to the house.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.233
But this time, I've had it with
boys.

00:44.533 --> 00:46.500
Gary got stuck into Abbie.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.633
And now Gary's having a baby.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.433
But it's not fucking mine.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.200
Me and Aaron got a best friend
with benefits kinda vibe going
on.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.600
Now we're in relationships,
gotta be on wuh best behaviour.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.967
Where you sleeping tonight?

01:04.833 --> 01:08.667
Last time was good, but this
time
it's gonna be a pure belter.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.333
(screaming)

01:11.400 --> 01:14.400
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

01:14.467 --> 01:15.733
Bucking...

01:15.800 --> 01:17.933
...necking...

01:18.000 --> 01:19.400
...and drinking.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.833
Toon, we are coming for ya.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.033
Shit's about to go down.

01:30.167 --> 01:31.600
This is mint.

01:32.533 --> 01:34.367
(cheering)

01:36.667 --> 01:39.033
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.100
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.900
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.900
I'm preened to perfection.

01:46.967 --> 01:49.133
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.833
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.633
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.567
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.767
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.032
Hey!

02:10.100 --> 02:11.767
Perfect.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.800
(yells)
You're fine.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.433
I feel like I've given birth.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.133
I'm standing here
watching Marnie get a colonic.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.400
I swear I've just seen
a bit of peperoni.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.200
(phone rings)
And the phone rings.

02:27.267 --> 02:30.467
Oh, my God, it's Anna. Oh, nah!
What the fuck does she want?

02:30.533 --> 02:34.167
Anna, man, there's no way I can
answer it, I'm preoccupied.

02:34.233 --> 02:37.600
Marnie's a bit busy right now.
She's got a tube up her arse.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.100
"Sophie, Toon Tours has
rocketed."
(gasps)

02:40.167 --> 02:43.667
"I need you to get everyone
back to the house today."

02:43.733 --> 02:44.767
Today?
Oh, my God.

02:44.833 --> 02:48.533
Not the best time, but OK.
"I'll leave that with you." Bye.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.933
I'm buzzing we're going
back in the house.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.433
I need to send a voice note
to all the family

02:53.500 --> 02:57.033
and tell them to get their arses
in gear.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.200
Aye-aye, you lot!

02:59.267 --> 03:01.833
"You'll never guess who's just
rang.
Anna."

03:01.900 --> 03:05.367
"And she wants us back
in the house today." What?

03:05.433 --> 03:08.033
"So, get packing
and we'll see you later on."

03:08.100 --> 03:11.433
After we finish getting Marnie's
shit out of her arsehole.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.033
(laughs)
Marnie's shit out of her
arsehole?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.633
What the fuck?
I don't know.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.433
Sophie, why did you say that? I
used
to tell Aaron that I never
poo'd.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.533
Oh. Well, they're gonna know
now.
(groans)

03:22.600 --> 03:24.800
I've only just had
another MMA fight,

03:24.867 --> 03:27.567
so I let the guys know
I need more time to recover

03:27.633 --> 03:29.367
and I'll be with them very soon.

03:29.433 --> 03:32.500
I won't be in today,
but have a fucking wicked night.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.067
I am absolutely buzzing
to get back in this house

03:38.133 --> 03:40.500
and get mortal
with the rest of the family.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.300
Shit. I nearly forgot.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.467
Chloe, meet your new boyfriend.

03:52.167 --> 03:55.400
I'm so excited to get back
in the Geordie Shore house.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.767
I'm single,
I've got a new hairstyle...

03:57.833 --> 04:00.367
I'm gonna be so sophisticated
this time.

04:00.433 --> 04:04.067
...and I have finally passed
my driving test.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.967
Thank you. Thank you very much,
everyone. Thank you.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.733
# On my way back to the house #

04:12.367 --> 04:15.633
Me and my nanna are going to
pick up Nathan. (honks horn)

04:15.700 --> 04:18.267
Hello, trouble.
How are you doing, Nan?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.733
How are you?
Do you like me friend?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.400
Oh, my God.

04:22.467 --> 04:26.900
This is Pablo Dick Kebab.
And he's got a massive sauseej.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.733
Fucking hell, that's a big one.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.767
Hey! How do you know it's
a big one, Ab? (laughter)

04:31.833 --> 04:34.033
Nan, do you like his willy?
I love it.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.067
I am buzzing to get
back in the house

04:43.133 --> 04:46.167
and see my fucked-up family.
Marnie!

04:46.867 --> 04:48.567
Thanks for helping us, Soph.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.600
Sorted.
Party!

04:52.500 --> 04:55.933
Actually, Abbie, how do you feel
about the whole Gaz situation?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
I am really happy for him.

04:57.567 --> 05:02.000
Last time, Gary got with me, and
now
he's back with his girlfriend

05:02.067 --> 05:06.533
and he's having a baby. I really
hope things don't get awkward.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.100
All depends if he
actually comes back.

05:09.167 --> 05:11.567
Could be a chance for
someone else to come in.

05:11.633 --> 05:14.500
Oh, my God, new cock!
Fresh meat for me.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.433
God, last time I seen Aaron,
he was fighting.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.900
I hope he's not too hurt.

05:24.967 --> 05:28.067
Aaron won his MMA fight
in 30 seconds,

05:28.133 --> 05:30.367
so why does he need to recover?

05:30.433 --> 05:33.133
I know what he's doing,
he's fingering his bird.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.267
Can't believe me and Aaron
are both in a relationship.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.833
I just want him to
treat us the same.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.533
Me and Aaron are both in
relationships this time.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.667
But I hope we can still be
friends
cos it means a lot to us.

05:44.733 --> 05:48.233
Let's get back to the house,
get them choons on.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.433
(horn honking)

05:51.500 --> 05:53.567
Party time!

05:53.633 --> 05:55.867
Oh, my God, this looks so good.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.000
Hello! Hola!

06:00.067 --> 06:02.000
Yes! I am the first one!

06:02.067 --> 06:07.633
Whoa. Oh, my God, what the hell
is that? It looks like a teepee!

06:07.700 --> 06:10.800
The house is looking
absolutely fucking stunning.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.400
Now all I need
is everyone to get here.

06:13.467 --> 06:17.200
(gasps) Perfect. I'm gonna
quickly shave me minge

06:17.267 --> 06:19.167
just in case any fit lads turn
up.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.533
How could I forget to shave
such a beaver?

06:30.167 --> 06:32.133
Hello?
Who's that?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.400
What? I don't know that voice.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.633
Just me?

06:35.700 --> 06:36.867
(screams)

06:36.933 --> 06:38.033
(laughs)

06:38.100 --> 06:40.933
I don't know if my eyes
need to go to Specsavers,

06:41.033 --> 06:42.400
but who the hell is that?

06:42.467 --> 06:43.900
Are you a new boy?

06:43.967 --> 06:46.333
Yeah, my name's Sam.
Nice to meet ya. Hi, Sam.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.333
Yay!

06:48.400 --> 06:51.667
Where's everybody else?
What a shame. Oh, yeah.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.833
Play it cool, Chloe, play it
cool.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.633
Hi, I'm Chloe. You all right?
Nice to meet ya.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.300
I'm Sam, I'm 22,
and I'm a single lad.

06:59.367 --> 07:02.633
And I'm absolutely buzzing to be
in the Geordie Shore house.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.033
Want us to show you around?
Yeah. Like it?

07:05.100 --> 07:06.833
It's huge.
This is where we live.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.433
Oh, my God, he looks
a little bit like a girl

07:09.500 --> 07:12.933
and that is exactly my type.
I think he fancies us. Yes, get
in.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.533
Why are your nipples so,
like, pointy-outy?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.400
Cos the top's too tight.
To your nipples. My nipples.

07:18.467 --> 07:19.533
Nipples!
(laughs)

07:19.600 --> 07:22.567
Me and Chloe are already getting
on
like a house on fire.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.167
I'm gonna love living here.

07:24.233 --> 07:27.567
What is your type? I do like
blonde hair normally, big boobs.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.967
I've got blonde hair.
I've got big boobs.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.167
Boobs that size
aren't hard to clock.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.067
But I'm trying to do it
disguised.

07:34.133 --> 07:37.867
I've got one eye looking there,
the
other looking there. Quarter to
12.

07:39.567 --> 07:40.667
Yeah!
(laughs)

07:40.733 --> 07:44.033
I cannot wait for the others to
get here and meet him. (laughs)

07:47.733 --> 07:51.300
I am so excited to see
who's already here. Bring it on.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.800
Hello!

07:52.867 --> 07:56.933
(all shouting)
Hiya.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.067
Oh, my God, we've got a new boy.

07:59.133 --> 08:02.333
Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.033
Only way to be part of this
family
is you've gotta be

08:05.100 --> 08:08.233
a fucking mint drinker.
Howay, Sam, let's see what you
got.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.967
Come on, Sam! Get it down ya!

08:10.033 --> 08:13.400
Come on, you can do it, Sam.
One, two, three. Go.

08:13.467 --> 08:17.767
(cheering) Girls, you will
never,
ever drink me under the table.

08:17.833 --> 08:21.300
Chloe, do you think Sam's your
type?
I do. He's right there, man.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.100
You have to answer on the spot.
Yeah.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.133
You do?
Is Chloe yours? Yeah.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.000
Think there could be a spark?

08:28.067 --> 08:31.967
There's not just sparks between
me
and Sam, there's fucking
fireworks.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.600
Stop, I'm getting nervous. I'm
loving how welcome I feel
already.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.600
But there's another girl I know.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.067
I sort of know Abbie.

08:39.133 --> 08:42.567
Cos she's from the same area...
Have you shagged her before? No.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.633
Kissed her? Fingered her?
(laughs)

08:44.700 --> 08:47.500
Like an interrogation.
I've probably looked at her.

08:47.567 --> 08:48.633
Do you fancy her?

08:48.700 --> 08:51.933
Yeah, she's a good-looking girl.
You fancy her? Oh, shit.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.533
If Abbie gets here
and fancies him too,

08:54.600 --> 08:58.133
this could get very messy.
Competition. Nah, I'm not into
that.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.067
You've gotta just pick one of
wuh.
Ooh. (laughs)

09:02.367 --> 09:04.167
Car!
Hide. Hide, hide.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.267
That must be the others.
I can't wait to see their faces

09:07.333 --> 09:09.200
when we surprise them with Sam.

09:09.267 --> 09:10.400
See you later.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.633
I am buzzing to see everyone.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.633
Hello!
(cheering)

09:15.700 --> 09:18.800
All right? Yous, I've got
something exciting to tell yous.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.833
We've got a new lad.
Eh?

09:20.900 --> 09:21.967
Pablo, come on.

09:22.667 --> 09:23.900
Oh, my God.

09:23.967 --> 09:27.633
We've got a surprise for you,
too.
One, two, three! (cheering)

09:27.700 --> 09:29.200
What the fuck?!
All right?

09:29.267 --> 09:31.400
Pablo is shite now!

09:31.467 --> 09:32.700
This is Sam.

09:32.767 --> 09:36.133
I've just brought in a new boy,
and there's actually a new boy.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.133
Now I feel like a dickhead.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.567
Fancy seeing you here.

09:39.633 --> 09:43.867
I can't believe Sam is in the
house.
I'm totally in shock.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.300
Me and Sam already know each
other.
What?

09:46.367 --> 09:49.500
He's definitely caught my eye
on a few nights out back home.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.500
What do you think of Sam?
He's only just walked in.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.867
He's got better eyebrows than
me.

09:54.933 --> 09:59.700
Abbie and Chloe's fannies are
pulsing. I could see the
vibrations.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.667
Glad we've got a good-looking
boy.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.233
Nathan, what the fuck is that
on your head?

10:04.300 --> 10:06.333
Yous all have weaves,
so I wanted one.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.000
Is that extensions?
Nah, it's my hair. It grew.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.233
You look like Destiny's Child.
(laughs)

10:11.300 --> 10:14.767
These bitches are just jealous
cos I look unbe-weave-able.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.867
Where's Gary? I genuinely
thought he'd be back now.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.600
I know Gary's having a baby,

10:19.667 --> 10:22.267
but he hasn't even replied
to my voice message.

10:22.333 --> 10:26.200
Right, howay, Sam, initiation.
One, two, three. Neck it, neck
it.

10:26.267 --> 10:30.167
I think we should go and get
ready.
(cheering)

10:31.967 --> 10:33.833
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.333
Aaron and Gary might not be
here,
but that is not stopping me.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.700
(yells)

10:39.767 --> 10:44.933
We have a new boy, and I'm
gonna get pure mortal tonight!

10:48.467 --> 10:52.033
Shall we make up a secret
handshake?
All right, let's practice.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.000
That was natural!
Oh, my God.

10:54.067 --> 10:57.533
Even though me and Nathan just
met,
I feel like I've known him ages.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.333
You have bronzer? Yeah.
We're comparing makeups.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.833
Our bromance is getting off to
a good start.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.567
If you were out with your lad
mates,
would you go home with a bird?
Yeah.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.600
Every time?
Nine times out of ten.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.700
You're like Gary.

11:09.767 --> 11:11.400
Obviously, I don't mind having

11:11.467 --> 11:13.733
a Friday and Saturday night
girlfriend.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.033
But if a girl came along
who I really liked,

11:16.100 --> 11:17.600
I'm open to making a go of it.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.633
My first impressions,
especially of Abbie and Chloe,

11:20.700 --> 11:23.267
have been good.
I feel I'll get on with them
well.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.067
I feel like you'll get on
with everyone very well.

11:27.133 --> 11:30.700
I'm excited for tonight. Are
yous?
I'm excited. First night.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.733
There's more vagina here than
cock.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.433
Aaron needs to get here
to balance things out.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.233
Have you ever had it, where
you've
both been in a relationship?

11:39.300 --> 11:41.733
Nah, it's always been me
in relationships.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.933
I've got no idea how Aaron's
gonna
be with us when we get in the
house.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.733
He could avoid us or be awkward.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.133
How do yous feel about Sam?
I think he's good looking and
stuff,

11:51.200 --> 11:53.233
but I don't mind
if Abbie got with him.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.633
It's the first night.
Who knows?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.900
Don't know him yet.
Could be an arsehole.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.767
Two single girls, one single boy
is a recipe for disaster.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.533
What else could go wrong?

12:08.267 --> 12:11.900
Can you take us to the
Geordie Shore house, please?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.267
Lads!
Lads!

12:15.333 --> 12:18.233
Ladies. Oh, my God!
You look like you're matching.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.567
I'm buzzing we've got a lad
with fucking good dress sense.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.833
I'm so glad the family
is back together.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.567
And we've got Sam.
He's gonna fit in really well.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.800
And tonight, we're gonna show
him
what we're all about.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.767
Welcome to the family!
Welcome to the family!

12:32.833 --> 12:35.833
Sam, you do know you've joined
the most radgest family

12:35.900 --> 12:39.600
in the whole of the north east?
Once, Nathan fingered his own
arse.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.000
Really?
Me and Chloe shared a dildo
once.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.733
There was only one dildo...
To me, to you, to me.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.067
When she was about to come,
the batteries ran out.
(laughter)

12:51.000 --> 12:54.033
We've all gathered round the
table,
we're about to go out,

12:54.100 --> 12:57.167
and someone walks through the
door.
Hi.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.000
(all exclaim)

12:59.067 --> 13:00.467
Oh, my God.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.767
I did not see that coming.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.600
Hi.
What the hell?

13:04.667 --> 13:06.467
She's got massive balls.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.233
Naughty girl.

13:09.267 --> 13:10.600
What the fuck?

13:10.667 --> 13:14.667
I didn't expect this on me first
night. This house is fucking
mint.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.600
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:18.967 --> 13:19.167
.

13:21.733 --> 13:21.933
.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.633
We've all gathered round the
table,
we're about to go out,

13:32.700 --> 13:37.600
and someone walks through the
door.
(all exclaim)

13:37.667 --> 13:38.833
Hi.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.000
What the fuck?

13:40.067 --> 13:42.500
Hello!
Oh, my God.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.933
What's your name? Steph. You
all right? Hello. Nice to meet
you.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.400
Everyone is just
minding their own business

13:48.467 --> 13:51.533
and a new girl turns up.
She looks like Marnie with a
perm.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.200
Where've you come from?
Just got back from Ibiza. No?

13:55.267 --> 13:56.400
Hi, I'm Steph.

13:56.467 --> 14:00.133
I'm 24 years old.
Most of the year, I live in
Ibiza.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
I'm not gonna lie,

14:01.267 --> 14:04.667
I've got some unfinished
business
with someone in the house.

14:04.733 --> 14:07.367
So, where's Aaron, by the way?
How do you know him?

14:07.433 --> 14:08.733
Known him for years.

14:08.800 --> 14:14.167
Why do you wanna see Aaron so
much?
We've just got unfinished
business.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.633
Steph has got massive balls.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.867
She's stood by Marnie,
talking about how she knows
Aaron.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.500
Marnie won't be happy.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.600
What was it? I'm very intrigued.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.633
Well, we were texting and that.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.533
Chemistry?
Yeah.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.933
Already got a situation with
Aaron,
we're both in relationships.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.833
And then this new girl's
arrived.
It's just unnecessary drama.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.567
You know he's got a lass?
He's got a girlfriend.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.967
I am a bit shocked that Aaron's
got a girlfriend. I mean...

14:42.033 --> 14:43.967
I was expecting a bit of
flirting.

14:44.033 --> 14:47.967
Anyone else wanna walk in?!
No! So let's go out.

14:48.033 --> 14:50.100
(all cheer)

14:50.167 --> 14:53.433
We've got two new family
members.
So, let's go out on the Toon

14:53.500 --> 14:55.300
and make it a night to remember.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.233
Fog on the Tyne is all mine,
all mine!

14:58.300 --> 15:00.567
Fog on the Tyne is all mine!

15:06.833 --> 15:11.000
It's the first night out, and
the
first night is always the
biggest

15:11.067 --> 15:12.633
and the baddest.

15:12.700 --> 15:16.667
I've got a feeling tonight
isn't gonna end well. In a good
way.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.700
(cheering)

15:22.767 --> 15:25.867
The family's back together
and we've got two new faces.

15:25.933 --> 15:29.333
Everyone's on such a good vibe,
the music's bouncing

15:29.400 --> 15:32.167
the drinks are flowing.
Tonight is gonna go off.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Steph's only been here five
minutes

15:38.067 --> 15:41.233
and I already feel like
we're gonna get on.

15:41.300 --> 15:46.567
The best way to welcome a newbie
is a constant flow of shots.

15:46.633 --> 15:49.133
Let's get mortal, man.

15:56.433 --> 15:59.467
Fucking hell, Chloe,
you don't beat around the bush.

16:13.433 --> 16:16.200
I'm being very, very cautious
about Sam.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.800
Just because I've been hurt by
so many boys in this house
before.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.933
I do not want that to happen
again.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.067
After what Steph came in
and said about Aaron,

16:32.133 --> 16:34.567
I wanna know how Marnie feels
about her.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.267
At the end of the day, Aaron is
still one of me closest friends,

16:44.333 --> 16:46.233
so I'm always gonna
look out for him.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.967
And Steph is putting him in
an awkward situation.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.267
He's got a girlfriend.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.833
It's never easy for new girls to
come into the house

17:03.900 --> 17:05.000
at the best of times,

17:05.067 --> 17:07.900
but Steph coming in and talking
about Aaron like that

17:07.967 --> 17:09.733
hasn't done her any favours.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.933
I've seen Chloe
chatting to Sam tonight,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.133
so I think it's about time I got
in
there and had a little flirt
myself.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.233
I'm having a chat with Abbie,
we're having a bit of a flirt,

17:26.300 --> 17:28.800
but it's her twins
that have caught my eye.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.467
I knew that this top would work.
Men are such suckers.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.567
Me and Sam are getting on great,

17:46.633 --> 17:49.300
but he's saying he fancies
both me and Chloe.

17:49.367 --> 17:53.000
But I fancy my chances cos all
she talk about is chicken
nuggets.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.767
Aaron's been grafting me for
years.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.567
He must have only just
started seeing someone,

18:25.633 --> 18:28.200
so I wanna see what happens
when he gets here.

18:34.267 --> 18:36.633
There was always something
that held us back

18:36.700 --> 18:40.200
from getting in a relationship
with Aaron. If he was texting
Steph

18:40.267 --> 18:43.333
when he was with me, then I was
right to never commit to him.

18:48.267 --> 18:51.733
Everyone is fucking plastered.
I hope it's like this all the
time.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.500
It's fucking mint.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.433
When I see Abbie and Sam
talking,

19:03.500 --> 19:05.967
I do get a teeny-weeny,
tiny bit jealous.

19:06.033 --> 19:09.000
But I need to ask Nathan
what my chances are with Sam.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.167
Right, Nathan,
I am gonna prove you wrong.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.333
It is all about the subtle
approach.

19:35.367 --> 19:36.833
Chloe's looking proper fit

19:36.900 --> 19:39.900
and her face seems to be moving
very close to mine.

19:41.233 --> 19:44.733
Oh, my God. We're necking on.
Loser Abbie, you're a loser.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.567
This is kinda nice, but I
thought
I was gonna keep me options
open.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.500
This is definitely Chloe
sticking it on me.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.767
Fucking hell, Chloe,
you're not playing hard to get.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.867
That can't be easy
for Abbie to watch.

20:01.933 --> 20:05.900
Although, she's that drunk,
I don't think she's even
noticed.

20:10.467 --> 20:14.167
We've had a wicked first night
back.
It's time to get back to the
house

20:14.233 --> 20:18.567
because everyone is absolutely
mortal, especially Nathan and
Steph.

20:18.633 --> 20:21.667
That girl is gonna fit in
perfectly.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.133
Ooh! Hey! Hey! Hey!

20:34.200 --> 20:37.567
We get back to the house,
and it's feeding time at the
zoo.

20:37.633 --> 20:40.233
(wails)

20:40.300 --> 20:43.367
Aye, aye, aye, aye!
(laughter)

20:43.433 --> 20:46.233
Shall we go for a chat?
Since we're the newbies.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.533
Marnie's gone to bed,

20:47.600 --> 20:51.367
so I'm gonna see if I can find
out
more about this unfinished
business,

20:51.433 --> 20:55.067
newbie to newbie. And Pablo,
I'm holding your dick for
comfort.

20:55.133 --> 20:59.733
You and Aaron, have you necked
on?
We haven't slept with each other
yet.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.067
Yet's the important word.
Have you necked on with him?
Maybe.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.667
That means yeah.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.900
Steph is not giving me
a straight answer,

21:06.967 --> 21:09.400
she's probably gonna sleep with
him.

21:09.467 --> 21:14.400
Whatever anybody thinks, we've
still
got that... unfinished
chemistry.

21:14.467 --> 21:17.567
I'm gutted Aaron's not here,
but it's my first night,

21:17.633 --> 21:20.833
so nothing's stopping me
from getting in that hot tub.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.733
Where's Nathan? Is he coming?
Nathan!

21:23.800 --> 21:27.833
I might be drunk,but nothing,
and I mean nothing,

21:27.900 --> 21:30.467
is gonna stop me
from eating this food.

21:30.533 --> 21:31.700
Nathan!

21:31.767 --> 21:35.433
I thought I looked drunk.
Nathan's making me look sober.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.700
(indistinct)

21:39.767 --> 21:42.300
I want to get to know
the newbies even better,

21:42.367 --> 21:44.367
so I've got an idea for a game.

21:44.433 --> 21:48.767
Steph. Snog, marry, avoid.
Nathan, Sam, or Aaron?

21:48.833 --> 21:52.267
Whoever you pick snog,
you've gotta snog. I'll snog
Nathan.

21:53.733 --> 21:55.233
I would marry Aaron.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.733
Avoid Sam?
(laughs) I love Sam.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.600
Right.
Now to the important question.

22:00.667 --> 22:05.400
Sam. Snog, marry, avoid.
Steph, me or Chloe. (laughs)

22:06.100 --> 22:08.333
I'd probably snog yous both.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.200
The competition's on, bitch.

22:10.267 --> 22:11.700
Go on, snog her.

22:15.933 --> 22:17.533
That was long.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.133
Move over, Chloe.
Let me show ya how it's done.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.867
She needs her milk.

22:23.667 --> 22:27.433
Oh, it's going on for too long.
Me
and you need to moy it on.
(laughs)

22:27.500 --> 22:29.067
(indistinct)

22:29.133 --> 22:32.767
I'm fucking pissed off Sam's
got to kiss unbelievable girls.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.167
I'd neck on with 'em.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.467
(laughs)

22:36.533 --> 22:40.567
I didn't expect this on me first
night. This house is fucking
mint.

22:43.800 --> 22:48.533
How do you feel, Sam? Can we all
take a moment and look at
Nathan?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.900
(laughter)

22:50.967 --> 22:54.600
Fucking hell. If there was ever
a sign that we needed to go to
bed,

22:54.667 --> 22:57.367
it would be seeing the state
of Nathan right now.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.800
First night in the house
has been absolutely hilarious.

23:06.067 --> 23:07.867
Somehow I'm naked.

23:07.933 --> 23:11.200
And the only thing there is
around
to cover me is a pizza slice.

23:11.267 --> 23:14.700
Naughty girl.
(laughter)

23:16.700 --> 23:19.867
Tonight has been amazing,
and I am buzzing that Sam is
here.

23:19.933 --> 23:24.900
He is like a breath of fresh
air.
In me fanny. (exhales)

23:30.767 --> 23:33.800
Supposedly, you and Steph
have got unfinished business.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.633
I'm so sorry, Sam,
but this is happening.

23:38.067 --> 23:41.600
I've got some news, and I don't
think they're gonna like it.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.000
Fuck's sake, man.

23:43.067 --> 23:45.067
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:47.467 --> 23:47.667
.

23:50.200 --> 23:50.400
.

24:05.867 --> 24:07.733
Good morning.
Morning.

24:08.733 --> 24:12.000
Last night was mint.
But I'm definitely feeling it
today.

24:12.067 --> 24:15.167
You know Chloe was necking on?
With Sam. (gasps) When?

24:15.233 --> 24:17.400
In the club.
We just had a cheeky kiss.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.433
He fancies me and Abbie.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.400
I've just found out that Chloe
and Sam were necking on.

24:22.467 --> 24:24.900
Although she's saying
nothing is happening,

24:24.967 --> 24:27.500
fancying the same boy
is now even more awkward.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.167
What happened in the hot tub?

24:29.233 --> 24:31.633
I necked on with him as a dare,
so did you

24:31.700 --> 24:35.033
Yous both were necking on with
him?
Yeah. But it was just a dare.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.200
I know it was for a dare,
but they're playing with fire.

24:38.267 --> 24:41.267
Where's the girl?
Her name's Steph.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.833
She's in the lads' room, I
think.
So, Steph slept in the boys'
room.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.400
I bet you she was waiting
for Aaron to come back.

24:47.467 --> 24:50.300
She was mortal, wasn't she?
She was very drunk.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.133
(moans)
I don't know who I am anymore.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.633
I've woke up fresh as fuck, but
I cannot say the same for
Nathan.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.633
How was your first night?

25:00.233 --> 25:02.733
What the fuck am I doing
in the boys' room?

25:02.800 --> 25:05.633
I'm gonna go and see the girls.
Like a sausage roll.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.300
Morning! Hello, you.
Where've you been?

25:08.367 --> 25:09.700
Dirty stop-out.
I know.

25:09.767 --> 25:13.200
I didn't think there was a bed
for
us. Have you got any knickers
on?

25:13.267 --> 25:15.733
No, I've got no clothes on.
Now Steph's sober,

25:15.800 --> 25:18.467
I want to know what's gone on
between her and Aaron.

25:18.533 --> 25:20.967
You were very drunk last night,
but you said,

25:21.033 --> 25:23.633
"It doesn't matter if Aaron's
got a girlfriend."

25:23.700 --> 25:26.067
He's been trying to graft us
for years.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.433
Aaron was the one
that always texted me,

25:28.500 --> 25:30.933
so I'm looking like
the one that's after him

25:31.000 --> 25:32.500
when it's not like that.

25:32.567 --> 25:36.133
We've always planned to meet up.
Just have to see what happens.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.233
Oh, my God,
everyone's text before, Steph.

25:39.300 --> 25:42.767
It's hardly unfinished business.
What does that even mean?

25:45.500 --> 25:48.233
I'm so sorry, Sam,
but this is happening now.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.000
(laughs)

25:52.067 --> 25:54.700
Nathan, haway, man. That is
rank.

25:54.767 --> 25:57.700
What the fuck happened with you?
We went in the hot tub

25:57.767 --> 26:01.667
and played a little game.
Kissed Chloe, and then kissed
Abbie.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.700
No, you didn't.
I was just getting to know them.

26:04.767 --> 26:08.300
Oh, yeah, cos you go on
a wine tasting session.

26:08.367 --> 26:11.533
(laughs) So you tasted the
girls before you buy them.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.033
This boy doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.600
He got with Chloe in the club.
If he actually got with Abbie,

26:17.667 --> 26:19.433
Chloe would lose her shit.

26:19.500 --> 26:22.433
You've been claimed.
I've not been claimed yet, man.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.933
Oh, no, Sam, you have.
(laughs)

26:26.933 --> 26:29.667
Everyone's feeling worse for
wear
this morning.

26:29.733 --> 26:32.100
Breakfast should sort us out.

26:32.167 --> 26:34.300
Marnie, Steph, haway!

26:34.367 --> 26:37.433
(cheering)
Last night was good, wasn't it?

26:37.500 --> 26:40.167
Nathan, remember being asleep
sat up outside?

26:40.233 --> 26:41.900
Are you still pissed?
Yes.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.400
(laughter)

26:45.967 --> 26:49.433
We're all cooking breakfast,
and then the door goes.

26:50.267 --> 26:55.267
(cheering)
Babycake!

26:55.333 --> 26:56.733
It's Aaron!

26:57.600 --> 27:00.567
None of us knew when Aaron
was gonna come back in,

27:00.633 --> 27:03.167
and I'm so pleased it's this
early.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.533
How ya doin', mate?
You all right? You good?

27:05.600 --> 27:07.400
Yeah, good, mate.
Hello.

27:07.467 --> 27:11.533
I did not expect to see him
right now. I look like shit.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.833
I want the ground to swallow us
up.
There's the MMA fighter.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.800
It's really good to see
everyone.
I can't help but notice two
newbies

27:18.867 --> 27:22.100
and it's always nice to see
a familiar face. Hello.

27:22.167 --> 27:24.367
This is Steph.
I know Steph.

27:24.433 --> 27:26.933
Sam, nice to meet ya.
Nice to meet you, mate.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.133
There's no time like the
present.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.433
I may as well get this out now
while everyone's here.

27:32.500 --> 27:35.867
Supposedly, you and Steph
have got unfinished business.

27:35.933 --> 27:38.900
I'm not gonna lie,
we have got a little bit of
history

27:38.967 --> 27:41.500
and I do think Steph's fit.
But this is awkward.

27:41.567 --> 27:44.267
Did you sex text?
No.

27:44.333 --> 27:47.033
Send a dick pic?
Nope. I've got a girlfriend.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.200
There's two things
on my mind right now.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.767
This is embarrassing
and Aaron's looking fit.

27:51.833 --> 27:55.133
Nathan, I cannae stop looking
at your fucking hair. Fuck off.

27:55.200 --> 28:00.000
Aaron's changing the subject. I
doubt we'll get anything out of
him.

28:00.067 --> 28:03.733
Obviously I've come in a little
bit
late. I've got some massive
news.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.800
I'm loving being back
with everyone,

28:05.867 --> 28:09.667
but I've got some news to tell
them
and I don't think they'll like
it.

28:09.733 --> 28:12.667
Everyone knows Gaz is having
a bairn. I spoke to him.

28:12.733 --> 28:16.133
He was just saying that it
doesn't
feel right to come in here...

28:16.200 --> 28:18.267
I don't even know how to say
this.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.467
He won't be coming back at all.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.333
What? And he hasn't even came
to say bye? Fuck's sake, man.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.533
I can't believe that.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.133
He's not an emotional person,
but...
He'd rather avoid it. Aye.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.667
I would like to see him.

28:36.733 --> 28:38.667
I'm sad that Gaz isn't coming
back.

28:38.733 --> 28:40.967
He was here when I first
walked in the house

28:41.033 --> 28:42.700
and I wanted him here to the
end.

28:42.767 --> 28:45.800
How do you feel, Aaron?
Are you gutted, like? Massively.

28:45.867 --> 28:48.033
He's having his own family now.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.867
Gary's always been a father
figure
in this house.

28:50.933 --> 28:54.500
And if he's gonna be like that
to
his baby, he's gonna be a good
da.

28:54.567 --> 28:58.500
Yous, I've got a really good
idea.
We should have a parsnip party.

28:58.567 --> 29:01.600
(cheering)
What about parsnip soup?

29:01.667 --> 29:05.200
Put parsnips all over. Talk
about
our favourite memories of Gaz.

29:05.267 --> 29:07.533
If we're gonna give Gary
a good send off,

29:07.600 --> 29:10.633
what better legacy to celebrate
than his parsnip penis?

29:10.700 --> 29:16.067
I'm gonna go food shopping.
Who wants to come with us?

29:16.133 --> 29:18.800
Me and Marnie are the
only people in the house with

29:18.867 --> 29:22.467
first-hand experience of Gaz's
parsnip, so it's only right I
go.

29:22.533 --> 29:26.433
Why don't you come, Sam? Then
we'll
find out the size of your penis.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.233
I mean, parsnip.
(laughs)

29:28.300 --> 29:30.567
Nathan, we'll go get
stuff for the house.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.900
I'm gonna get ready.
I'm gonna shower.

29:32.967 --> 29:35.400
This is gonna be the best
parsnip party ever.

29:35.467 --> 29:38.967
Gaz was known for the parsnip,
but it feels weird sending him
off

29:39.033 --> 29:41.533
thinking about his fucking knob.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.033
Bring us back a treat!
(laughs) Bye!

29:49.300 --> 29:53.267
Me, Abbie and Marnie have come
to
the supermarket to get all the
food.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.467
Pies and rice?

29:54.533 --> 29:59.100
Pie, rice and parsnips.
I'm hoping it's gonna turn out
nice.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.900
(coughs)
(laughter)

30:03.967 --> 30:06.033
Oh, there's loads of parsnips
here.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.133
Sam, you are about to get
an education

30:08.200 --> 30:11.233
on what Gary's penis looks like.
Is that how big it is?

30:11.300 --> 30:15.333
I can barely remember what
Gary's parsnip looked like.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.567
Abbie?
I've gotta feel it.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.400
I think that's the best one.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.633
Looking forward to
eating Gary's cock.

30:21.700 --> 30:24.167
How awkward was it
with Steph and Aaron?

30:24.233 --> 30:27.300
She did say to me that
they've kissed. She said that?

30:27.367 --> 30:28.633
Yeah.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.700
Now Steph has admitted that
her and Aaron have kissed.

30:31.767 --> 30:35.267
That's something she didn't tell
us.
I'm not bothered about it,

30:35.333 --> 30:38.400
but I'll speak to Aaron later.
I'll find out if it's true.

30:38.467 --> 30:41.500
For all we know,
he might actually like Steph.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.600
Me and Nathan are at the
printers.

30:47.667 --> 30:51.467
If Gaz can't come to the party,
he can be there in cardboard
form.

30:51.533 --> 30:52.667
Hurry up!

30:52.733 --> 30:55.067
Why am I carrying this?
I'm not your bitch.

30:57.233 --> 30:59.733
You ever snapped anyone's banjo?
Yeah.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.267
It's the worst, isn't it?
You think you came on your
period.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.933
Hello.
Fucking hell, it's tidy in here.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.233
Marnie, Abbie and Sam
are finally back.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.000
Thank God, cos I can stop
worrying
if Sam and Abbie are flirting.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.967
Is this what Gary's willy looks
like?
Near enough.

31:15.033 --> 31:18.800
We get back from the printers,
and I
wanna show the others the
surprise.

31:18.867 --> 31:22.267
We've got faces for Gary,
Gary's faces. Oh, my God.

31:22.333 --> 31:24.567
It's like Gary's having
a stag night.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.700
I'm gonna cut a hole out of that
and fuck it. Nathan, that...

31:27.767 --> 31:30.967
You'll get a fucking paper cut.
(laughs) Come on, everyone!

31:31.033 --> 31:32.833
Let's have a party for Gary!

31:32.900 --> 31:36.067
We need to get the house
decorated,
get the meal on the go,

31:36.133 --> 31:38.767
cook these parsnips.
This one? It'll kill ya.

31:38.833 --> 31:41.067
Want me to tell you
the perfect size?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.067
What the fuck is that? Pencil
dick?

31:43.133 --> 31:45.367
No, not the width!
I mean the length!

31:45.433 --> 31:48.967
Don't even dare look at me.
I want this party to be amazing.

31:49.033 --> 31:52.100
Gary Pablo.
Go on, cock!

31:53.033 --> 31:55.633
Despite all the awkwardness
with Steph earlier,

31:55.700 --> 31:58.967
it's still so nice
to have Aaron back in the house.

32:02.767 --> 32:06.233
We were wrong. I'm so glad
it's not awkward between them.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.833
But I have always been
a massive fan of Maron.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.200
I'm just sad that
it never worked out.

32:13.133 --> 32:14.367
Don't.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.100
Aaron, what are you doing?
(laughs)

32:18.167 --> 32:20.367
I think it looks canny good.

32:24.433 --> 32:27.667
All the girls are getting ready
and I know in me breasts,

32:27.733 --> 32:29.633
tonight is gonna be a good one.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.833
I just feel like because we're
having a big tribute to Gary,

32:32.900 --> 32:36.167
you single girls should pull.
Yeah. What about Aaron, Steph?

32:36.233 --> 32:39.733
I'm not bothered. I wanna go out
and meet someone tonight. Good.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.100
Good for ye.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.600
I'm hoping I have some fun
tonight,
but I also wanna talk to Aaron

32:44.667 --> 32:46.267
so I know where I stand.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.800
Gonna get mortal!
Gary! Gary!

32:49.867 --> 32:51.167
Parsnip! Parsnip!

32:53.767 --> 32:54.833
Chloe and Abbie.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.967
Who do you like more?
At the moment...

32:57.033 --> 32:58.833
I know who you'll say.
I know.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.467
Right, wait there.
Abbie.

33:00.533 --> 33:02.333
No, I think Chloe.
Chloe.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.167
At this moment in time, Chloe.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.367
Me and Chloe are getting on
really well.

33:06.433 --> 33:08.867
But I still think Abbie's fit
and I'm single,

33:08.933 --> 33:13.000
so I wanna get to know her
tonight.
I'm in a good position. No ties.

33:13.067 --> 33:16.033
If I was single,
I would be relishing this
moment.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.967
I wanna know what the deal is
with Aaron and Steph.

33:19.033 --> 33:23.000
Yesterday, when we were outside,
she
was mortal, she said yous
kissed.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.300
Who, me and Steph?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:25.367 --> 33:29.500
I'm not gonna lie.
Aaron Chalmers! (laughs) He did.

33:29.567 --> 33:32.767
Steph is a fit girl, and I have
tried to graft her in the past.

33:32.833 --> 33:35.833
And we've necked on, but that's
it.
I think.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.833
I'm surprised I haven't banged
her.

33:37.900 --> 33:41.167
If you were single, do you think
you'd go back there? Ooh.

33:41.233 --> 33:43.900
I'm not gonna lie,
Steph's a good-looking girl,

33:43.967 --> 33:45.333
but I'm in a relationship.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.200
Even if Aaron was single,
he wouldn't get with Steph

33:48.267 --> 33:50.133
cos he does care
what Marnie thinks.

33:50.200 --> 33:55.167
Let's eat parsnips and have a
drink.
Let's go have a parsnip party!

33:56.233 --> 33:58.600
Oh, look at all the little
parsnips.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.567
Gaz would be very proud.
The place looks wicked.

34:01.633 --> 34:04.233
Gary Beadle!
Gary!

34:04.300 --> 34:06.133
Long may he reign.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.733
It's sad that we're sitting here
seeing Gaz off,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.967
but he will always be
part of this family.

34:11.033 --> 34:14.167
I'm gonna miss his jokes.
I'm gonna miss his dancing.

34:14.233 --> 34:17.900
I'm gonna miss his steak wraps.
What's Abbie gonna miss?

34:17.967 --> 34:19.600
Parsnip! Parsnip.
Parsnip.

34:19.667 --> 34:22.833
I don't actually think he
realises
how much he was loved

34:22.900 --> 34:25.132
and how much he's gonna be
missed.

34:26.300 --> 34:30.000
He cared more about everyone
having a good time.

34:30.067 --> 34:32.800
When I came in,
Gary was one of the first people

34:32.867 --> 34:36.933
I made friends with. It's so
strange
to think he's not gonna be here.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.933
Can you remember when he stole
Kyle's fake vagina

34:40.000 --> 34:43.733
and was, like, fucking it
in the toilet? Like...

34:43.800 --> 34:46.433
The amount of times
I walked in on Gary wanking.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.833
Everyone should raise a parsnip
to Gary.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.233
Me and Gary
started this journey together.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.000
He's like a brother to me.

34:53.067 --> 34:56.533
To Gary fucking Beadle.
(all) To Gary Beadle.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.333
(cheering)
Gary, I'm gonna miss you, mate.

35:04.733 --> 35:06.633
The chemistry is so obvious.

35:08.633 --> 35:11.967
One thing that never fails
is my sexy dance moves.

35:12.867 --> 35:15.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:18.000 --> 35:18.200
.

35:20.700 --> 35:20.900
.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.267
I know Steph and Sam
seem like a right laugh,

35:31.333 --> 35:33.433
so let's get out
on the fucking Toon.

35:38.667 --> 35:42.100
We get to the club and it's
packed.
Everyone is buzzing.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.567
Tonight is gonna be amazing.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.500
Let's do this.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.000
Everybody's drunk, dancing
and having a mint time.

36:03.067 --> 36:06.833
I'm just glad that me and Steph
are part of this family.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.033
Me and Sophie are watching
Sam and Chloe,

36:16.100 --> 36:19.267
and it's so nice to see her
smiling
and he's loving it as well.

36:29.367 --> 36:31.967
I need to talk to Steph
to make sure we're cool.

36:32.033 --> 36:34.100
I don't want her to feel
uncomfortable.

36:34.167 --> 36:37.400
And I want mine and Marnie's
friendship to stay on track.

36:51.700 --> 36:54.600
Aaron's confirming that
he's got a girlfriend.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.600
I feel like he's shutting us
down,

36:56.667 --> 37:00.033
but I'm not the one to break up
a relationship. I'm gonna bow
out.

37:02.900 --> 37:05.867
I can't believe Marnie
hasn't kicked off at Steph.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.900
It must be because we're both in
happy relationships.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.867
I know me and Aaron
are in relationships,

37:31.933 --> 37:34.867
but I can't help it, I need to
ask him about him and Steph.

37:40.333 --> 37:43.533
I've necked on with Steph in
the past, but it's not a big
deal.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.833
I wouldn't wanna upset Marnie
because I do still care about
her.

37:49.733 --> 37:52.933
I'm glad Aaron's being honest
and his normal self around us.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.933
Him being in a relationship
as well as me was the balance

37:56.000 --> 37:57.300
we always needed.

38:03.333 --> 38:06.833
At times, it's been as bad as
it possibly could be between
wuh,

38:06.900 --> 38:10.567
but against all odds, it's
amazing
we can still be such close
friends.

38:15.467 --> 38:19.433
I'm looking at Aaron and Marnie,
and the chemistry is so obvious.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.567
I've bowed out with Aaron,
but I wonder if Marnie really
has.

38:28.467 --> 38:31.033
Chloe is taking the full-on
approach
with Sam.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.600
But I am gonna be classy, sassy,
and let him come to me.

38:43.067 --> 38:46.333
It's good talking to Abbie.
I like that I can't work her
out.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.933
Does she or doesn't she like me?
I'll have to get to know her
more.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.100
I do really like Sam,
but when I see him talking to
Abbie,

39:04.167 --> 39:05.867
I do feel really insecure.

39:12.967 --> 39:16.300
Because of everything that
Chloe went through with Martin,

39:16.367 --> 39:17.900
she feels really insecure.

39:17.967 --> 39:21.233
So I'm hoping that Sam
could potentially be the boy

39:21.300 --> 39:23.267
to make her feel beautiful
again.

39:26.333 --> 39:29.767
Tonight, I need to make sure
that
I pull him again to seal the
deal.

39:29.833 --> 39:33.200
One thing that never fails
when I've tried to pull a lad

39:33.267 --> 39:35.500
is my sexy dance moves.
Watch this, Sam.

39:40.833 --> 39:43.933
Fucking hell, Chloe. I think
you need some help with this.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.067
Sam, come here.

39:51.267 --> 39:54.600
Thing is with Sam,
I feel like we're very, very
alike.

39:54.667 --> 39:56.933
That is amazing,
cos he could be me husband.

40:04.167 --> 40:07.700
Me and Chloe are having a wicked
night, it's getting very flirty.

40:07.767 --> 40:09.433
I can sense we're gonna neck on.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.567
# I'm necking on with Sam

40:13.633 --> 40:16.267
# Buh, uh, zuh, zuh, ih, nuh,
guh
Buzzing #

40:18.733 --> 40:21.167
I've just been having
a flirty chat with Sam,

40:21.233 --> 40:23.800
and now he's necking on with
Chloe
in front of us.

40:23.867 --> 40:27.300
I just don't want a boy to come
in between our friendship.

40:27.933 --> 40:30.800
I feel like, now,
me and Sam have been necking on,

40:30.867 --> 40:34.367
and everyone can see there's
chemistry. Abbie needs to back
off.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.667
I've had a wicked night. Time to
head back and get some scran.

40:56.867 --> 40:59.700
All right, calm down.
Ooh, fuck, I nearly fell over.

40:59.767 --> 41:03.133
We get back to the house, and
that
food has actually shut us up.

41:07.167 --> 41:10.667
Look how quiet everyone's gone
now we've got food. Greedy
cunts.

41:10.733 --> 41:14.833
Come on, Gary Beadle. I'm gonna
give Gary one last farewell.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.967
I love ya. I want him to
swim away with the fishes.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.033
Shit. I think he's drowning.

41:22.633 --> 41:26.167
I'll give you this to settle
down on.
It's milk. Bye.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.067
(balloon bursts)
Ah! (laughs)

41:29.133 --> 41:33.833
Gary Beadle. I know you want my
dick. Get down and give me five.

41:33.900 --> 41:38.200
This is getting mental down
here.
It's been another mint night.

41:40.033 --> 41:42.733
No! Not the weave! Oh, no, the
hair!

41:42.800 --> 41:46.333
Mortal Aaron
always takes things too far.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.933
Think you had a fucking MMA
fight
in your real life, eh? Haway,
son.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.933
No. (laughs)
I'm joking. No. I'm joking.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.233
I'm joking. No. Aaron, no!

41:58.933 --> 42:03.567
Aaron. Aaron, I don't want to.
I don't want to. I don't want
to!

42:03.633 --> 42:06.533
My first night back has been
sick,
I'm fucking mortal.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.367
It's now time to go to bed.

42:11.467 --> 42:14.833
Oh, my God, I have ended up
in the wrong bed. What a shame.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.933
(yells)

42:17.000 --> 42:19.967
(laughs)
Guys, wanna watch me have a poo?

42:20.033 --> 42:24.000
Oh! Nathan is disturbing
my hanky panky. Fuck off!

42:24.067 --> 42:28.033
Bitch, I know you want that
dick!

42:29.000 --> 42:30.067
Go on, suck him off.

42:31.733 --> 42:33.267
# Chloe likes a dildo

42:33.333 --> 42:35.233
(Sam and Nathan) # La, la, la,
la #

42:37.467 --> 42:38.833
Yous, they're kissing!

42:38.900 --> 42:41.500
Since Chloe has made
all this effort to come in,

42:41.567 --> 42:44.933
it would be rude not to
slip her a finger. (laughs)

42:46.967 --> 42:48.667
I've had such a good night.

42:48.733 --> 42:52.967
And I know it's very, very soon,
but I feel like Sam a lot more

42:53.033 --> 42:54.433
than what I liked Marty.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.833
Gee!

43:02.500 --> 43:04.267
I am the plant woman!

43:07.233 --> 43:09.700
This has turned into
absolute carnage.

43:11.467 --> 43:12.533
Goal!

43:12.600 --> 43:14.900
I'll have Abbie.
Are you taking the piss?

43:14.967 --> 43:18.500
I'll have Marnie. Nah! This is
bringing back horrible memories.

43:18.567 --> 43:19.567
Oh!

43:21.100 --> 43:24.467
She knows I have been in his
bed.
And he's even fingered us.

43:24.533 --> 43:27.100
Tonight, I will not end up
in Marnie's bed.

43:29.967 --> 43:32.400
You can sense the chemistry
a mile off.

43:32.467 --> 43:34.567
I'm absolutely sick of this
shit.

43:34.633 --> 43:38.433
You know what, Abbie and Sam
can fucking have each other.

44:04.467 --> 44:04.667
.
