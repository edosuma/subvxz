00:01.168 --> 00:03.202
<i> [Adam] We are here to help</i>
<i>  Leanne and Ray, her mom.</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.370
<i>  Leanne does not</i>
<i>  like the house.</i>

00:04.372 --> 00:06.171
<i>  She hates the activity</i>
<i>  that's happening.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:09.208
<i> [Leanne] Something just...</i>
<i>  nasty is here.</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.409
<i> [Amy] She's terrified.</i>

00:10.411 --> 00:12.311
[Leanne] The back of my head,
there's this thought,

00:12.313 --> 00:14.580
"Is it gonna turn
on my mother?"

00:15.182 --> 00:16.949
I'm scared all the time.

00:16.951 --> 00:18.417
<i> [Ray] There's this</i>
<i>  bright light.</i>

00:18.419 --> 00:20.019
<i>  Thing got bigger and bigger.</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.421
<i>  And then, all of a sudden...</i>
<i>  and gone.</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.556
That was scary.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.725
[Adam] Why don't you do
something impressive?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.293
Oh!

00:29.697 --> 00:32.197
I got full body chills
after that.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.033
Leanne's very afraid
of this house.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.601
[Leanne] Are you following me?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.905
<i> [Adam] We're dealing</i>
<i>  with a jerk.</i>

00:39.907 --> 00:41.707
<i>  I lost the camera</i>
<i>  that she's in.</i>

00:42.877 --> 00:44.276
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:44.278 --> 00:46.011
We just want to help
this family.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.179
<i> [Adam] The living</i>
<i>  need our help.</i>

00:47.181 --> 00:48.447
Have you always been here?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.715
He was watching already.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.927
<i> [Amy] Adam and I</i>
<i>  are in Newburgh, New York.</i>

01:01.929 --> 01:05.097
<i>  We received a desperate</i>
<i>  phone call from Leanne.</i>

01:05.099 --> 01:06.899
<i>  She bought a house</i>
<i>  with her mother, Ray,</i>

01:06.901 --> 01:08.967
<i>  but moved out</i>
<i>  when she got married.</i>

01:08.969 --> 01:13.238
<i>  Now her mother is left</i>
<i>  to deal with the unrelenting</i>
<i>  activity alone.</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:15.074
<i>  Leanne's mom is away</i>
<i>  for the day,</i>

01:15.076 --> 01:18.343
<i>  but apparently,</i>
<i>  Leanne is so scared</i>
<i>  of the house</i>

01:18.345 --> 01:20.379
<i>  that she is going to</i>
<i>  meet us outside.</i>

01:20.381 --> 01:22.181
<i> -[Adam] Oh,</i>
<i>  she's already... Look.</i>
<i> -[Amy] Oh, yeah.</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:23.315
<i> [Amy] She's meeting</i>
<i>  us outside.</i>

01:23.317 --> 01:25.117
<i> [Adam] She's literally not</i>
<i>  inside the house.</i>

01:25.119 --> 01:27.086
<i>  The house looks</i>
<i>  so non-assuming.</i>

01:27.088 --> 01:30.022
<i> [Amy] But we've learned</i>
<i>  our lesson on that before.</i>

01:31.225 --> 01:33.158
-[Adam] Leanne?
-[Leanne] Yes?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.927
-Hey, Leanne.
-[Leanne] Hi! Hello.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.428
I'm Adam. This is Amy.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.330
-Hi, it's good to meet you.
-[Leanne] Hi.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.765
-Hi.
-[Leanne] Hi.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.800
[Amy] I know you don't want
to go inside, so...

01:41.802 --> 01:43.769
-I don't ever want to be
in there alone.
-[Amy] Okay.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.873
What do you feel like
when you walk into the house
for, like, the first time?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.842
-[Leanne] It depends
on the day.
-Okay.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.977
-I always know
something's there.
-[Adam] Uh-huh?

01:51.979 --> 01:54.580
But somedays,
it's just oppressive.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.816
Okay, so we'll go in
and you can tell us
what it feels like today.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.118
Yeah.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.287
Now, when was
this house built?

02:02.289 --> 02:05.691
-[Leanne] I do believe
it was 1946.
-[Amy] Okay.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.260
-[Amy] And you bought it
in 2008? Okay.
-[Leanne] Yep.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.496
[Leanne] I met my husband
and I moved to Westchester.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.166
Um, my mum, she's elderly.
She's got a bad leg.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.868
She's all I have.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.137
So I'm here, like,
three or four times a week.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.172
What does this place
feel like right now?

02:20.174 --> 02:23.342
It's hard today.
I wanna just not be here.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.078
I feel like running usually
when it's like this.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.681
And now, it sounds like you
are experiencing activity...

02:29.683 --> 02:31.283
-non-stop here.
-[Leanne] Non-stop.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.418
What kind of activity
is going on?

02:33.420 --> 02:36.021
[Leanne] So, I can start
from the beginning.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.122
-It's a lot.
-[Adam] Yeah.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.091
About a week after I moved in,

02:39.093 --> 02:41.927
I was in the bathroom,
getting ready for bed,

02:41.929 --> 02:45.531
and I saw a little,
black shadow about that high,

02:45.533 --> 02:48.700
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-run past the bathroom door.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.135
It scared me, so I left.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.004
-[Leanne] That was like
the first day.
-That was it.

02:52.006 --> 02:52.971
-Yeah, you were done.
-That was it.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.374
So, then I got
a contractor in here.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.010
He worked for about
three weeks.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.379
I came home one lunch break,

03:00.381 --> 03:02.347
and he was backing out
of the driveway.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.185
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-And he told me that
my house was haunted.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.087
[Leanne] And he was never
coming back in here
and he was so sorry.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.723
And he left like
$3,000 worth of tools.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.091
-Wow!
-[Leanne] Just left.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.060
[Amy] And what did he...
Did he say what happened?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.029
[Leanne] He wouldn't tell me,
he wouldn't talk about it,

03:17.031 --> 03:19.198
he just... he just fled.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.832
-Wow!
-[Leanne] And he just left.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.970
Then, I mean, it would really
just be constant
thumping, walking.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.940
Sounds like there's people
in the kitchen all the time.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.841
The TV goes on.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.243
Lights will go on and off.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.278
[Amy] Now, how many
square-feet is this house?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.247
925.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.951
-So all of this is happening
in a 925-square-foot home.
-You can't get away from it.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.587
I mean, that's insane to me.

03:41.589 --> 03:45.390
-And now, can you...
-[Adam] Yeah.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.594
-[Adam] I heard that. Did
you hear that creaking sound?
-Yeah. What's that sound?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.996
What is that?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.032
-It's the house. Mm-hmm.
-[Amy] It's like scratching.

03:54.034 --> 03:58.237
Can we move and see
a little bit more of this
section and keep talking?

03:58.239 --> 04:00.639
-[Leanne] Yeah.
-Just kinda show us around.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.942
[Leanne] A lot of activity
happens in this hallway.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.877
Um, there's always,
like, footsteps.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.446
This is the room
I got shoved in.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.848
I was standing here
on the 20th, doing some stuff,

04:09.850 --> 04:11.483
my mom was like here,

04:11.485 --> 04:15.821
and something just pushed
my spine into,
like, this doorknob.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.356
-[Amy] Wow!
-And it was hard.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.157
I don't wanna say push.
It's like shoved.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.059
That's violent.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.429
[Leanne] It was...
And I've never been touched
in the house until that point.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.231
Really? And so that was...

04:26.233 --> 04:28.300
Gosh, only like 11 days ago.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.769
-Mm-hmm. Right.
-And you knew we were
coming at that point.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.305
So now, I'm even more, like,
I hate this room.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.673
-[Amy] Mmm.
-I just hate this room.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.375
You don't have to be in there.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.977
-[Amy] Yeah, come on out.
-[Leanne] There's something
not right in that room.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.379
Do you want to show us
these rooms?

04:40.381 --> 04:42.814
-This is my bedroom.
-[Amy] Okay.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.516
I mean,
it feels light and airy.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.485
-It's nice and lit.
-[Adam] Yeah!

04:46.487 --> 04:49.254
We have to wait
till nighttime, so.

04:49.256 --> 04:54.893
I sound crazy, but I swear,
when it gets dark,
the house changes.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.228
[Amy] Really? Okay.

04:56.230 --> 04:59.898
It's like something just...
nasty is here.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.466
Things just get different.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.201
-Okay.
-[Leanne] One night
I was here,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.537
scared as usual,
and I sleep with
the lights on,

05:05.539 --> 05:08.006
I never sleep
in the dark, ever.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.509
And something shook my bed.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.179
And I looked,
and he... it let me see it.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.882
Little, black shadow,
looks like he's wearing
a hood,

05:16.884 --> 05:19.284
standing right where
you are actually.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.852
And it just stayed there,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.455
and then vanished, like,
maybe two seconds later.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.590
Do you always sleep
with the lights on?

05:25.592 --> 05:28.327
Or only sleep
with the lights on here?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.961
Only here.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.198
When did the bed shaking
and the little, tiny
shadow figure show up?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.266
[Leanne] That was like
last month,

05:34.268 --> 05:35.867
but it's happened before that.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.203
Like, they just
do it randomly.
I don't...

05:38.205 --> 05:40.839
-And who's room is that?
-[Leanne] That's my mom's.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.141
-Okay.
-[Amy] Let's check it out.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.010
-[Amy] So this is
your mom's room.
-[Leanne] Yes.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.879
[Leanne] She's seen lots
and lots and lots of stuff.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.381
But she's not scared like you?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.550
She doesn't really sleep
at night anymore.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.318
[Amy] She doesn't?
What does she do?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.353
She hasn't, for years.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.089
She watches TV
with all the lights on.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.224
-And then she sleeps
during the day?
-[Leanne] Yeah.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.893
-Oh, okay.
-So she's scared, but she...

06:01.895 --> 06:04.196
You know, and I tell her,
I'm like, "We can sell it."

06:04.198 --> 06:05.330
And she's just like, "No!"

06:05.332 --> 06:07.933
She's like, "I refuse
to let them win."

06:09.169 --> 06:11.203
I mean... Yeah, I get it.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.071
She's sort of letting
them win though,

06:13.073 --> 06:16.341
-when she has to alter--
-And stay up till
5 o'clock in the morning.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.342
-Yeah.
-[Amy] Yeah, she does.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.877
Has anything happened
to her that's--

06:18.879 --> 06:20.912
[Leanne] Yeah, here.
In this room.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.948
-[Adam] What?
-Um, she had a heart attack,

06:22.950 --> 06:27.352
and she was actually dead
for about five minutes.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.888
They had to break a few ribs
to bring her back.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.356
They almost didn't
bring her back.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.891
-[Adam] Oh, my [bleep]
-That happened in here?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.193
[Leanne] Uh-huh. In 2014.

06:35.195 --> 06:40.465
Did the activity for her,
specifically, increase
after that incident?

06:40.467 --> 06:43.034
No, it's been here
all along since she moved in.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.703
-[Adam] Okay.
-[Amy] We definitely need
to chat with her.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.138
All right, well,
that is a lot.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.206
I mean, it sounds like,
this is one of those
cases where, like...

06:48.208 --> 06:51.143
Sometimes, some cases we go to
and the person is, like,

06:51.145 --> 06:52.878
"In this room,
this one thing happened.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.379
In this room,
this one thing happened."

06:54.381 --> 06:57.816
But for you, it's like,
"This is what happens
all the time.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.985
You know, all the time,
I am hearing footsteps.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.788
-All the time, I'm hearing
voices, being touched--"
-Non-stop.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.957
[Amy] Okay,
so it stands to reason,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.292
we should experience
some of this while we're here.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.327
-[Adam] Right.
Let's go to the kitchen.
-Yeah.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.966
[Leanne] Oh, and I should
tell you about the mimicking
before I forget.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.168
-What's it mimicking?
-Mimicking?

07:16.170 --> 07:19.571
Yes. Um, my mother,
when she's here without me,

07:19.573 --> 07:22.374
she says she hears "Mom"
all the time, in my voice.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.542
[Amy] Wow.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.876
[Adam] Okay.
Are you an only child?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.178
[Leanne] I am, but I'm not.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.947
My brother... My older brother
died when he was three.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.149
-Oh, geez.
-[Adam] Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.251
So, and then, I was born
seven years later.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.120
-[Amy] Mmm. Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

07:35.122 --> 07:40.192
Is there anything that you do
that seems to either
make activity happen

07:40.194 --> 07:44.963
-or make activity subside?
-[Leanne] Just
be here, just...

07:44.965 --> 07:47.766
When I'm here,
it's like... they're like,
"Oh, there she is!"

07:47.768 --> 07:49.367
-[Amy] Mmm.
-[Leanne] We really need help.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.003
Well, you should be able
to come here
and visit your mom

07:52.005 --> 07:53.104
and not to worry.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.706
I'm scared all the time.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.276
-So, you're scared
all the time?
-[Leanne] Mm-hmm.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.880
-[Amy] Okay. No, it's okay.
-I'm sorry.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.317
[Amy] Well, we will do
our best to get to
the bottom of it,

08:05.319 --> 08:07.185
-and get some answers for you.
-Okay.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.054
-[Amy] All right.
I will be in touch for sure.
-[Leanne] Okay.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.122
[Amy] We're definitely
gonna need your help
throughout this.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.427
[Leanne] Just be
really careful.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.361
When I got shoved,
that was it.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.963
I was like, "Holy Cow!"

08:17.965 --> 08:19.698
I wanna be able to live
with myself, you know.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.969
I would be very upset
if you guys got hurt
or anything.

08:23.971 --> 08:27.472
<i> [Adam] Amy and I are here,</i>
<i>  and we're here to help</i>
<i>  Leanne and Ray, her mom.</i>

08:27.474 --> 08:28.673
<i>  And Leanne was terrified.</i>

08:28.675 --> 08:29.941
Leanne does not
like the house.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.543
She hates the activity
that's happening.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.479
She has a laundry-list
of things that have
happened to her.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.081
<i>  She's physically</i>
<i>  uncomfortable.</i>

08:36.083 --> 08:37.248
<i>  She shakes in the house.</i>

08:37.250 --> 08:39.518
<i>  And we cannot wait to get</i>
<i>  in there and investigate.</i>

08:39.520 --> 08:42.087
Leanne said that the house
completely changes
when it gets dark,

08:42.089 --> 08:44.723
and it is now officially dark.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.926
Um, so, maybe,
the house will come
alive for us.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.327
We're hoping so,

08:49.329 --> 08:51.496
because we need to get
to the bottom of what's
happening here.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.899
Honestly, I think,
we should each take a room,

08:53.901 --> 08:55.133
see what the noises are like.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.402
[Amy] I'll go into her room.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.041
<i> [Adam] I'm gonna go</i>
<i>  into the office,</i>
<i>  where she got pushed.</i>

09:14.521 --> 09:17.522
If there's anyone here,
do you mind shutting
these doors for us?

09:21.361 --> 09:22.460
Can you knock?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.163
Or push this bed?

09:27.267 --> 09:30.502
[Adam] I'm gonna move
to the mom's room.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.141
-[Amy] I'll move to the room
where she got shoved.
-[Adam] Okay.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.679
She said she was
standing here.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.389
<i>  Whoever's here</i>
<i>  who talks to Leanne...</i>

09:54.194 --> 09:55.427
and to her mom...

09:57.164 --> 09:59.431
[whispering]

10:01.034 --> 10:02.267
...you need to talk to us.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.235
You need to make
yourself known.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.572
She sent us here
to find out who you are.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.775
<i>  She wants you to leave,</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:13.111
<i>  but we think, you might be</i>
<i>  here for a reason.</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:16.081
So can you say something?
Can you...

10:16.083 --> 10:18.483
Can you do one of these things
she says you do?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.652
Close a door? Knock?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.523
[whispering]

10:29.529 --> 10:31.062
[whispers]

10:36.470 --> 10:41.573
[intense music playing]

10:47.814 --> 10:49.881
Amy, I'm gonna go
into the daughter's room,

10:49.883 --> 10:52.083
if you wanna go
in the mom's room.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.358
[sighs]

11:04.464 --> 11:07.432
I was sitting on that bed
and I got a wave of like...

11:08.135 --> 11:09.401
just weirdness.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.369
It wasn't that long.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.071
But it was also...
What was I saying?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.341
You were like,
"We're here because
she's asked us to be here."

11:16.343 --> 11:18.209
But it was this weird, like...

11:19.746 --> 11:22.047
you know, felt a little weird
and off.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.450
-Let's get some sage
and let's smudge the place.
-[Adam] Mm-hmm.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.119
And see if that upsets them,
'cause it...

11:28.121 --> 11:29.788
seems to be
a catalyst for her.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.290
Every time she does it,
the activity increases.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.025
Did you do anything
when you moved in?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.127
-Did you try to cleanse it
or anything?
-[Leanne] I did.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.363
-[Leanne] I burned sage.
I think it made it worse.
-You did?

11:41.768 --> 11:44.936
[Amy] Leanne has tried to sage
this place numerous times,

11:44.938 --> 11:47.972
and every time she's saged,
it made the activity worse.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.976
So we're gonna burn some sage,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.279
and see what happens.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.119
Let's get the recorder.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.322
All right,
so whoever is in here,
who's not like us,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.291
who is here all the time,

12:06.293 --> 12:10.462
you can talk into
this little red light
as loudly as you can,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.597
and tell us your name.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.336
Leanne and Ray are scared
to be here because of you.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.340
Why are you scaring them?

12:24.211 --> 12:30.415
Is there anyone in this house
that remembers when Ray
had her heart attack?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.619
Do you follow Leanne?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.426
I'll listen to these.

12:41.428 --> 12:46.831
<i> [Amy] You can talk into</i>
<i>  this little red light</i>
<i>  as loudly as you can,</i>

12:46.833 --> 12:48.299
<i>  and tell us your name.</i>

12:48.301 --> 12:52.170
<i>  Leanne and Ray are scared</i>
<i>  to be here because of you.</i>

12:52.172 --> 12:54.506
<i>  Why are you scaring them?</i>

12:54.508 --> 12:57.575
<i> [Adam] Is there anyone</i>
<i>  in this house that remembers</i>

12:57.577 --> 13:00.912
<i> when Ray had her heart attack?</i>

13:00.914 --> 13:02.447
<i> [Amy] Do you follow Leanne?</i>

13:03.717 --> 13:05.183
-[scoffs]
-[Amy] Nothing!

13:06.052 --> 13:07.685
So right now,
we're very frustrated.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.454
It is only
our first night here.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.992
But our hunch here is that
we're missing a key component
to this haunting.

13:13.994 --> 13:18.463
Yeah! It's gotta be something.
This is a mystery so far.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.902
<i> [Amy] We've had night ones</i>
<i>  that were like this before.</i>

13:23.904 --> 13:26.404
<i>  Obviously, like, this is not</i>
<i>  something new to us.</i>

13:26.406 --> 13:30.341
But I think that with
the amount of activity

13:30.343 --> 13:32.043
that was described to us
through the walkthrough,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.445
we had very high hopes
as far as what would happen,

13:34.447 --> 13:37.448
once we actually
got started investigating.

13:37.450 --> 13:42.387
<i>  I think we're gonna need</i>
<i>  to talk to Leanne's mom, Ray,</i>
<i> since she's here all the time.</i>

13:44.257 --> 13:45.924
[Ray] Sometimes,
when you walk into the house,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.725
-the house feels heavy.
-Mm-hmm.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.829
-There's like heavy air.
-[both] Mm-hmm.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.364
And I don't know how
to tell that to somebody.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.767
-The air feels--
-[Amy] Yeah, we know
that feeling very well.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.936
-There's like
a pressure in the house.
-[Adam] Oh, yeah.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.904
-Do you mind.
Let's go back to your bedroom.
-[Ray] Sure.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.173
[Ray] My bedroom,
very little happens.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.676
Uh, it stays outside.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.777
Oh, that's good.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.412
Well, I've done a lot
of cursing and yelling

14:07.414 --> 14:08.947
and getting the hell
out of my room.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.015
-[Adam laughs]
-Uh...

14:11.017 --> 14:13.351
There seems to be
a lot of stuff in here,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.186
-that comes from here.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.156
[Ray] But in here,
not so much.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.059
So I get knocking
from inside the closet door.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.260
-[Adam] This one?
-Mm-hmm.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.096
[Ray] So, what I do,
'cause there's
a crawl space...

14:25.098 --> 14:32.270
On the floor, there's a big,
square space covered
to go downstairs.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.772
So all of a sudden,
there would be knocking.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.241
[Adam] On the underside
of that?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.943
-[Ray] No, knocking on
the inside of the door.
-[Adam] Oh! Okay.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.346
[Ray] So I just put a whole
bunch of heavy stuff
on top of that.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.349
Now if I hear a knock,
it's very muffled.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.417
So it must be coming
from underneath,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.554
because there's no more
knocking on the door.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.458
[Adam] I wanted to talk
about your...

14:53.460 --> 14:54.993
the near-death experience
that you had.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.862
When I had the heart attack,
it turned out to be,

14:57.864 --> 15:01.366
I had a heart attack
and died the same day
my ex-husband died.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.839
I'm sure that my ex-husband
is in here.

15:07.841 --> 15:11.776
When I eventually woke up
from the coma in the hospital,

15:11.778 --> 15:14.479
I felt somebody patting me
on the thigh,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.547
saying, "It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay."

15:16.549 --> 15:18.883
And I smelled the Old Spice.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.518
I realized it was Richard.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.220
[Amy] Was Richard
Leanne's father?

15:22.222 --> 15:26.124
No. We divorced
from exhaustion
after my son died,

15:26.126 --> 15:29.360
and I wanted more children
and he was still traumatized.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.195
So I remarried.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.098
But it's strange
because a couple months later,

15:34.100 --> 15:37.335
I'm laying here one night,
and I thought I was dreaming.

15:37.337 --> 15:41.105
'Cause there's this
bright light, right over
my... my mirror.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.675
There's a big, bright light!

15:43.677 --> 15:45.777
And the cat's awake,
I'm awake,

15:45.779 --> 15:47.445
and I'm thinking,
"This is a weird dream."

15:47.447 --> 15:49.647
-[Amy] Right.
-And... I'm like...

15:49.649 --> 15:51.282
The thing got
bigger and bigger,

15:51.284 --> 15:54.986
and I said, "What the hell
is that? Get outta here!
What is that?"

15:54.988 --> 15:57.288
And then all of a sudden,
it went... and gone.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.489
[Adam] Hmm.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.059
-Interesting.
-[Adam] It just disappeared.

16:01.061 --> 16:04.862
And I could hear, behind
this bright light, voices.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.397
And they sounded familiar.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.099
That was so strange!

16:08.101 --> 16:11.102
They were jumbled up.
There were more
than one voice.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.538
It was like,
"Go away! Go away!"

16:13.540 --> 16:15.206
or "Not now!"

16:15.208 --> 16:18.009
I think that's exactly
what I saw when I died...

16:18.011 --> 16:19.077
-[Amy] Yeah.
-[Adam] Mm-hmm.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.712
and I was just reliving it.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.113
[Amy and Adam] Yeah.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.949
-Let's ask John about that.
-[Ray] But that was scary.

16:24.951 --> 16:28.252
[Amy] Well hopefully,
we can get to the bottom
of what's going on here.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.521
<i>  Ray died and came back.</i>

16:30.523 --> 16:33.257
<i>  That is an incredibly</i>
<i>  rare experience.</i>

16:33.259 --> 16:35.293
<i>  We're calling in our friend,</i>
<i>  John Tenney,</i>

16:35.295 --> 16:38.529
<i> a leading expert in paranormal</i>
<i>  and occult theory.</i>

16:38.531 --> 16:41.899
<i>  He hasn't just</i>
<i>  studied the topic</i>
<i>  of near-death experiences,</i>

16:41.901 --> 16:43.167
<i>  he's had one himself.</i>

16:43.169 --> 16:44.836
-There he is. Hey, John!
-Hey, John!

16:44.838 --> 16:49.874
We're dealing with a case
right now where, um,
one of the people in the home

16:49.876 --> 16:54.479
had a near-death experience,
where she actually died
for a number of minutes.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.815
We're trying to figure out
if that could play any part

16:57.817 --> 16:59.517
in the activity
that's going on here.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.788
<i>  So, I had my near-death</i>
<i>  experience when I was 17.</i>

17:03.790 --> 17:05.690
<i>  I died. I had a heart attack.</i>

17:05.692 --> 17:08.826
<i>  There's a lot</i>
<i>  of trauma involved,</i>
<i>  you can imagine.</i>

17:08.828 --> 17:14.799
<i>  But there does seem to be</i>
<i>  in a lot of cases...</i>

17:14.801 --> 17:18.970
<i>  something that I,</i>
<i>  in my personal notes,</i>
<i>  I always call it residue.</i>

17:18.972 --> 17:24.075
<i>  And it seems to be something</i>
<i>  that persists with a person</i>

17:24.077 --> 17:26.277
<i>  who has</i>
<i>  a near-death experience</i>

17:26.279 --> 17:32.717
<i>  that holds, kind of, the odor</i>
<i> of the place that you went to,</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:35.253
<i>  whether it be heaven</i>
<i>  or purgatory.</i>

17:35.255 --> 17:40.191
<i>  People with near-death</i>
<i>  experiences seem to be</i>
<i>  and seem to have</i>

17:40.193 --> 17:44.796
<i>  this almost-magnetic</i>
<i>  attraction sometimes</i>
<i>  to otherworldly beings.</i>

17:44.798 --> 17:46.164
Oh, that makes sense.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.399
The day that she had
her heart attack,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.768
her ex-husband died
of a heart attack that day.

17:50.770 --> 17:56.274
She said that she sensed him
almost immediately after.

17:56.276 --> 18:00.244
Like, him coming to her,
as she was recovering.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.046
And she just knew it was him.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.216
<i>  Yeah, so I mean,</i>
<i>  there's a lot there.</i>

18:05.218 --> 18:09.854
<i>  The most studied</i>
<i>  form of interaction</i>

18:09.856 --> 18:12.557
<i>  with ghosts or spirits</i>
<i>  or whatever you want</i>
<i>  to call them,</i>

18:12.559 --> 18:14.392
<i>  are crisis apparitions,</i>

18:14.394 --> 18:17.095
<i>  which are people appearing</i>
<i>  at the time of their death</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:18.663
<i>  or near the time</i>
<i>  of their death.</i>

18:18.665 --> 18:21.699
<i>  And if she's going through</i>
<i>  that experience as well,</i>

18:21.701 --> 18:24.969
<i>  there might just be</i>
<i>  a weird tangle</i>
<i>  that's happening</i>

18:24.971 --> 18:29.974
<i>  because two similar energies</i>
<i>  that were both</i>
<i>  involved with each other</i>

18:29.976 --> 18:31.242
<i>  died at the same time.</i>

18:31.244 --> 18:33.744
<i>  And it's just the universe</i>
<i>  trying to figure it out.</i>

18:33.746 --> 18:35.246
-That's interesting.
-[Adam] That's interesting.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.381
I think we just, kind of,
wanted to educate ourselves

18:37.383 --> 18:40.118
a little bit more on, like,
the near-death experience.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.489
<i>  Whether or not</i>
<i>  you want to understand</i>
<i>  the death experience,</i>

18:44.491 --> 18:47.058
<i>  we all inevitably</i>
<i>  will have one.</i>

18:47.060 --> 18:48.993
-Right. That's true.
-Right.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.729
-Thank you so much.
Super appreciative.
-Thanks so much.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.466
The idea that John
talks about where

18:55.468 --> 18:58.569
you have two people
who are connected
in such a way,

18:58.571 --> 18:59.804
they die on the same day.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.472
And then, one lives.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.910
It's almost like the universe
is like, "Oh, their energy
is sort of coupled."

19:05.912 --> 19:09.347
And if she had an experience
where he came through to her,

19:09.349 --> 19:12.850
he could still be
here with her,
or be a part of her.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.352
And that could be creating...

19:14.354 --> 19:16.187
I mean, it's something
we haven't dealt with
before obviously.

19:16.189 --> 19:21.125
And last night, we would
not have known to look
at that angle of the case.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.793
-I guess we'll see
what happens.
-[Adam] Yeah.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.095
<i> [Adam] Amy and I</i>
<i>  are determined to try</i>

19:24.097 --> 19:25.830
<i>  to experience something</i>
<i>  in this house.</i>

19:25.832 --> 19:27.932
<i>  Last night was</i>
<i>  extremely frustrating.</i>

19:27.934 --> 19:30.868
<i>  And I think we're gonna have</i>
<i>  to up the ante, a little bit.</i>

19:30.870 --> 19:37.241
<i>  We need to throw</i>
<i>  everything we possibly can</i>
<i> at this investigation tonight.</i>

19:37.243 --> 19:42.413
<i> [Amy] So Ray talked about how</i>
<i>  whatever is in this closet</i>

19:42.415 --> 19:44.248
<i>  knocks on the closet.</i>

19:44.250 --> 19:46.551
<i>  She suspects its coming</i>
<i>  from the subfloor.</i>

19:49.122 --> 19:51.055
Oh, yeah. There it is.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.725
Think I just heard a voice.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.431
[bleep]

20:02.035 --> 20:04.969
Oh, my [bleep]

20:04.971 --> 20:08.239
-[Adam] It spans the entirety
of the house.
-[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.774
[Amy] They like
to manipulate lights.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.576
We've got lots of new
equipment with lights.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.411
-[Amy] Set that all up.
-[Adam] Yeah, we do.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.482
[Amy] So this right here,
this is a para-lamp.

20:18.484 --> 20:22.186
And basically, what it is,
is it's a very visual
EMF meter.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.689
So if this detects EMF,
this will go up.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.391
It also has an alarm
that will sound.

20:27.393 --> 20:32.230
Um, and since whatever
is in this house likes to play
with electronics so much,

20:32.232 --> 20:37.535
we thought this might be
a good thing to put on top
of the subfloor opening.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.438
<i> [Adam] I put</i>
<i>  the trigger-object proximity</i>
<i>  sensor on this switch.</i>

20:40.440 --> 20:42.273
If anybody comes
close to this,

20:42.275 --> 20:45.009
tries to turn this on or off,
it's gonna go off.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.079
Plus, this entire wall
is really now
a trigger-object.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.914
This is an EMF tripwire.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.817
Each of these is an individual
EMF detector.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.454
And I'm gonna put these down
the entire hallway.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.422
So if anything
crosses through it,

20:58.424 --> 21:01.225
these lights will light up
and change color,

21:01.227 --> 21:03.961
depending how strong
the EMF fluctuation is.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.366
Is anybody using walkie?

21:09.335 --> 21:10.568
Like, seriously?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.237
'Cause the thing's
just going off.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.373
[Amy] I know, one of these
just went off too.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.941
[Adam] It's all going off
right now?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.175
[Amy] What's happening?

21:27.920 --> 21:29.253
[Amy] No, it's EMF.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.888
-[Amy] Unless it's... yeah.
-[Adam] Watch!

21:30.890 --> 21:31.989
[Amy] It's EMF.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.457
[Adam] Unless it's this...

21:34.994 --> 21:36.160
-[Amy] No.
-[Adam] Not that.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.729
I don't know.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.099
I got a weird vibe back there,
when I was getting
stuff set up.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.702
Oh!

21:47.440 --> 21:51.042
Whoever wants to come out
and play or talk to us...

21:51.711 --> 21:53.144
We put out everything for you.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.014
We've got all kinds of lights,
all kinds of things
that make noise,

21:57.016 --> 22:00.151
all kinds of ways you can
let us know you're here.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.952
[Adam] You can get
our attention by grabbing

22:01.954 --> 22:05.022
any of those purple lights
that you see.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.124
-[Adam] It went off.
-[Amy] Did that just go off?
I heard that.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.193
Who's down in the basement?

22:09.195 --> 22:10.961
You like it when Ray is here?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.700
Do you like Leanne?

22:15.702 --> 22:19.103
[Adam] We heard that you
turn off lights.

22:19.105 --> 22:22.173
Why don't you do
something impressive?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.975
[Amy] You know,
millions of people
are watching this.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.912
And we don't want to-- [gasps]

22:27.914 --> 22:29.313
[Adam] Oh!

22:33.319 --> 22:37.088
-Okay!
-[Amy] We're listening now.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.290
Now I've got full body chills
after that.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.860
And it went.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.231
from here to, like...
Like, you could
see it walking.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.766
-Like it went... Yeah.
-[Adam] It went down.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.434
Uh, that's crazy.

22:50.436 --> 22:54.338
The other thing that you might
want to try if you'd like,
is talking to us.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.973
Like, just using your voice.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.342
This little recorder
records your voice.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.379
Okay. Thank you.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.713
-Mmm-hmm.
-The whole thing lit up.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.715
I'm gonna put it
nearer to you.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.285
So that way, I'll stand back
and you can answer
questions for us.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.259
So, can you tell us
what your name is?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.999
-[Adam] That one in the closet
went off.
-That went off.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.200
[Adam] What's your name?

23:26.205 --> 23:27.371
[Amy] The recorder just moved.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.342
-[Adam] It slid back.
-Yeah, it just slid.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.444
[Adam] Did you have it on...

23:33.446 --> 23:35.012
I have it on video.

23:41.354 --> 23:44.355
Are you related
to Leanne and Ray?

23:46.959 --> 23:49.627
[Amy] Are you
Ray's ex-husband?

23:56.202 --> 24:00.971
Are you protecting Ray
and Leanne from something?

24:00.973 --> 24:07.278
Were you in the house when Ray
had her near-death experience?

24:08.414 --> 24:11.015
I'm gonna come get
that recorder, okay?

24:15.321 --> 24:17.288
Could it have slid by itself?

24:17.290 --> 24:19.089
[Amy] You'd have to
really bump it.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.224
I don't know.
That was really--

24:21.294 --> 24:24.028
[Adam] It's strange.
We have it on video,
which is good.

24:24.030 --> 24:28.132
[sighs] I mean, it moved.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.201
We never see things move.

24:30.203 --> 24:34.472
[indistinct playback]

24:35.441 --> 24:37.341
<i> [Adam] What's your name?</i>

24:37.977 --> 24:39.977
Oh, we hear it move.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.680
-Oh, that's when it was moved.
-That's when it moved.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.049
<i> [Adam] Are you related</i>
<i>  to Leanne and Ray?</i>

24:45.051 --> 24:47.284
<i> [Amy] Are you</i>
<i>  Ray's ex-husband?</i>

24:47.286 --> 24:50.254
[playback continues]

24:50.256 --> 24:51.522
It just went off again.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.726
Again.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.395
<i>  ...when Ray had</i>
<i>  her near-death experience?</i>

24:58.397 --> 24:59.430
Again.

24:59.432 --> 25:00.598
Again.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.334
It's lighting up like crazy.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.001
But not those.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.271
-It's very--
-[Adam] No,
it's just in there.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.609
We're trying to figure out...

25:13.212 --> 25:15.813
-Now that lamp's gone,
because...
-This one just went out?

25:15.815 --> 25:17.147
[Adam] Yeah.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.516
[Amy] And that just went off?

25:19.886 --> 25:22.052
Okay. So this is... okay.
This is important.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.356
because we're experiencing
what they've experienced.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.258
A lot of light manipulation.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.226
We had an object move,

25:29.294 --> 25:32.129
which I can't remember
the last time we've caught
anything on camera moving.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.198
-[Adam] Yeah.
-But I can see why
she's scared.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.967
Like, this is a lot
for a lot of people.

25:36.969 --> 25:40.838
I was thinking,
what if we lower a recorder
into the basement,

25:40.840 --> 25:44.575
and did, like, an EVP session
from above?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.977
Since there's all that
activity coming out
of the basement.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.012
[Adam] Yeah.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.413
<i>  Amy and I have gotten</i>
<i>  a lot of activity</i>

25:49.415 --> 25:52.950
<i>  surrounding the entrance</i>
<i>  to the sub-basement.</i>

25:52.952 --> 25:56.353
<i>  And so, what we are doing</i>
<i>  right now is crafting a way</i>

25:56.355 --> 25:58.689
<i>  to send our equipment</i>
<i>  down into the basement</i>

25:58.691 --> 26:00.291
<i>  without disturbing the area,</i>

26:00.293 --> 26:03.060
<i>  to see if we can get</i>
<i>  even more communication.</i>

26:03.062 --> 26:06.530
<i>  There may be something</i>
<i>  down there that just</i>
<i> doesn't want to come upstairs.</i>

26:06.532 --> 26:08.032
[Amy] What is setting
these off?

26:08.501 --> 26:10.234
[Adam] I have no idea.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.169
They're totally freaking out
right now.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.705
<i>  Starting EVP session now.</i>

26:16.442 --> 26:19.443
Did you hide in the basement?

26:20.179 --> 26:22.713
<i>  Do you know who Leanne is?</i>

26:28.321 --> 26:30.721
Is that your safe space?

26:31.557 --> 26:35.326
<i> Are you mad that we've invaded</i>
<i>  that area?</i>

26:39.031 --> 26:41.165
Do you know who Ray is?

26:42.969 --> 26:45.436
<i>  Are you Ray's ex-husband?</i>

26:46.339 --> 26:48.572
Who is scaring everyone
in this house?

26:56.048 --> 26:59.216
Is there someone
that's always with Leanne?

27:01.420 --> 27:04.154
<i> [Amy] Who enjoys</i>
<i>  scaring Leanne?</i>

27:04.457 --> 27:06.023
Anything else?

27:06.025 --> 27:08.692
[Adam] Recorder, that's me.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.165
Okay, so,
let's give this a listen.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.669
<i>  Starting EVP session now.</i>

27:18.671 --> 27:21.472
<i>  Did you hide in the basement?</i>

27:22.141 --> 27:23.273
[distorted feedback]

27:23.275 --> 27:26.176
-Ooh, does that say basement?
-[Adam] Basement. Yeah.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.946
<i> [Amy] Did you hide</i>
<i>  in the basement?</i>

27:29.682 --> 27:31.015
[distorted voice]

27:31.017 --> 27:33.250
It says basement
really softly.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.552
<i>  Do you know who Leanne is?</i>

27:36.122 --> 27:38.255
<i>  Do you know who Ray is?</i>

27:38.257 --> 27:39.523
<i> [distorted voice] Yes.</i>

27:39.525 --> 27:41.959
-Yes.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.294
<i> [Amy] Do you know who Ray is?</i>

27:44.296 --> 27:46.497
[distorted voice]

27:46.499 --> 27:48.432
-Yes, I do!
-Oh, yeah!

27:48.434 --> 27:50.134
Yes, I do!

27:54.306 --> 27:57.007
<i> [Amy] Are you Ray's</i>
<i>  ex-husband?</i>

27:57.009 --> 28:00.611
<i>  Are you Ray's ex-husband?</i>

28:00.613 --> 28:01.445
[distorted voice]

28:01.447 --> 28:02.946
That says...

28:02.948 --> 28:04.915
Honestly, to me,
that sounds like a yes.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.618
<i>  Is there someone</i>
<i>  that's always with Leanne?</i>

28:09.388 --> 28:12.156
<i> [Amy] Who enjoys</i>
<i>  scaring Leanne?</i>

28:13.092 --> 28:14.524
That was the last question.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.861
You know, in every...
We got an answer every time
we talked about

28:17.863 --> 28:19.430
anything associated with Ray.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.533
If it was about Leanne,
or "Did you follow Leanne?",

28:22.535 --> 28:24.201
they had no answers for us.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.136
It makes me think, family.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.072
-Yeah!
-[Amy] Ray's family.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.341
Why is he in the basement?

28:31.343 --> 28:33.877
[Adam] Because Ray's intention
is to keep it in the basement.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.180
She covered it,
she put things over it.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.283
I find it hard to believe
that her ex-husband's hiding
in that basement.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.118
[Adam] But I don't think
he's hiding.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.053
That's what she wants,
so that's where he is.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.855
But...

28:44.857 --> 28:48.992
She does not feel the same way
about what's happening
in this house as Leanne.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.994
[Amy] I don't think
he's the one bullying.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.830
[Adam] Right,
because we literally had
to stick a recorder

28:52.832 --> 28:54.098
down there to get him to talk.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.032
[Amy] We've got to talk
to Leanne.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.469
[Adam] You need
to talk to her,
where it's just you and her.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.537
[Amy] She seemed
very comfortable
with me yesterday,

29:00.539 --> 29:02.339
so maybe, I can just
sit her down and...

29:03.075 --> 29:04.374
just be frank.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.413
We're trying to figure out
what the catalyst
is for activity.

29:09.415 --> 29:13.016
-If there's anything else
that you can think of that--
-It's just...

29:14.887 --> 29:16.420
-They do it.
They just do it.
-Yeah.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.790
Is there anything that
happened in your personal life
around that time?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.925
No. I mean, my grandmother
died in 2012.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.161
-And we were fine.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:24.163 --> 29:28.031
Was there any, like,
personal turmoil...

29:28.033 --> 29:29.299
I don't wanna
really talk about that.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.334
No, I totally get it.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.102
I was stressed out
I was alone.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.172
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Leanne] I'm telling you.
This house is insane.

29:35.174 --> 29:38.041
I think we're gonna have
to get you in the house
with us at night.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.544
And I know you don't
wanna do that,

29:40.546 --> 29:41.912
-but we'll--
-I'll do what I have to.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.982
Yeah. I mean,
'cause we're thinking,
maybe if you're there,

29:44.984 --> 29:47.818
it will maybe
instigate some act...

29:47.820 --> 29:49.386
Like, maybe it's around you.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.322
I think that knowing that
you were going through
an emotional moment, too,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.391
when you got here,
is important.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.360
Like, we don't have
to talk about,
like, the details.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.361
But we'll figure it out.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.463
We've got tricks
up our sleeves.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.465
-[Leanne] Okay.
-[Amy] We'll pull out
all the stops tonight.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.867
<i> [Amy] Before</i>
<i>  calling in Leanne,</i>

30:03.869 --> 30:06.303
<i>  we're going to investigate</i>
<i>  with the spirit box.</i>

30:06.305 --> 30:10.240
<i>  It seems to be an easier way</i>
<i>  for spirits to communicate</i>
<i>  with us.</i>

30:17.850 --> 30:19.983
<i> [Adam] So, that device</i>
<i>  that Amy has in her lap,</i>

30:19.985 --> 30:21.919
<i>  you can talk through it.</i>

30:21.921 --> 30:24.721
There... These things
are going off.

30:24.723 --> 30:30.694
You can talk through it,
you can speak to me
and to us through her.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.666
I will.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.438
What just went off her face?

30:43.342 --> 30:44.708
-[Adam] Is it--
-I'm here.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.044
Are you Adam?

30:56.155 --> 30:58.188
I'm Adam. Who are you?

31:00.426 --> 31:02.059
How are you doing?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.994
I'm good. How are you?

31:03.996 --> 31:05.095
How are you doing?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.131
This light's going off.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.801
-Are you okay?
-Okay.

31:10.803 --> 31:15.606
[Adam] You know, Amy and I
are here to help Leanne.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.377
Leanne's very afraid
of this house.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.279
Do you know why
she's afraid of this house?

31:22.281 --> 31:23.313
Can you tell us?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.249
Nonsense.

31:26.886 --> 31:27.951
It's nonsense?

31:29.154 --> 31:30.387
Impossible.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.523
[sinister music playing]

31:33.525 --> 31:36.627
[Adam] Well, she tells us
that she's afraid of you.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.530
If she's not afraid of you,

31:40.532 --> 31:43.267
can you tell us
what she's afraid of?

31:43.269 --> 31:45.035
Go on with it.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.137
[Adam] I'm just tryin...
We need to figure out
who you are.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.007
-[Amy] Keep going.
-Right.

31:50.009 --> 31:53.010
-Hear me.
-[Adam] I can hear you.
What do you wanna say?

31:57.016 --> 32:00.284
So far, you are not telling me
any information,

32:00.286 --> 32:03.453
and you're supposed to use
Amy and that device
in front of you

32:03.455 --> 32:04.621
to give me answers.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.023
I heard it before.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.525
Let's go!

32:08.527 --> 32:12.629
I'm... I'm honestly just
waiting for you to
tell me something...

32:13.999 --> 32:15.265
-profound.
-[Amy] Car.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.569
Why'd you bring her?

32:20.172 --> 32:23.040
Now, Sean, tell me, is she--

32:23.042 --> 32:25.575
Yeah, they just pulled up.
Right. "Why'd you bring her?"

32:28.480 --> 32:30.747
Yeah, so we brought Leanne...
we brought Leanne--

32:30.749 --> 32:32.316
[Amy] Mysterious.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.217
[Adam] We brought Leanne
so that she could talk to you,

32:34.219 --> 32:37.921
so that she could,
kind of, confront you,

32:37.923 --> 32:39.156
because we don't know
who you are.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.724
We want answers from you.

32:40.726 --> 32:44.227
What is your goal for Leanne
when she comes into the house?

32:46.065 --> 32:47.698
You're gonna tell me?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.067
-Or are we just
gonna find out?
-Are you mad?

32:50.069 --> 32:51.501
[Adam] I'm not mad. I'm...

32:51.503 --> 32:52.803
Oh, you are.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.237
No. [scoffs]
I'm actually not mad.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.474
You've actually shed a light
on who you actually are.

32:57.476 --> 33:01.078
I know the kind of person
that I'm dealing with
right now.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.180
You think you can control
the situation.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.082
Yet, you have no control.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.416
That's what I think
you're doing.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.251
Thanks for that.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.992
[Adam] Okay. I'm gonna
stop Amy and bring
Leanne in,

33:14.994 --> 33:19.696
because you aren't in control
and we are in total control.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.200
And we're gonna control
the situation and Leanne
is gonna investigate with us.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.335
That's right. Empowered.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.937
Yeah, I am empowered.

33:26.939 --> 33:30.273
So I'm gonna just...
'cause we have all the power.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.676
You don't have any power.
You're just probably
being a jerk.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.711
That's right.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.980
You're-- Okay, thank you.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.950
So, how'd that go?

33:43.055 --> 33:44.087
[Adam] We're dealing
with a jerk.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.323
-[laughing] Oh, really?
-[Adam] He's such a jerk.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.892
[Amy] So I think that
the key now is we get
her in here,

33:48.894 --> 33:51.528
-and we see how everything
reacts with her in this space.
-[Adam] Yeah.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.732
[Adam] Welcome back
to your house!

33:55.734 --> 33:57.167
Yeah. Thanks.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.703
[Amy] We're gonna have
you sit at the end
of this hallway here,

33:59.705 --> 34:01.004
-on that chair.
-[Leanne] Okay.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.706
I'll be right here,
watching you.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.274
And Adam will be here as well.

34:04.276 --> 34:08.845
I'm gonna give you
this recorder and then,
we'll have you ask questions.

34:08.847 --> 34:12.082
And we may throw in
some questions from down
here as well.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.984
-Okay.
-[Amy] So I'm gonna go ahead
and start this.

34:13.986 --> 34:15.919
-[Amy] There's gonna be
a little red light.
-Okay.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.255
[Amy] I'm gonna go,
quickly get into position.

34:18.457 --> 34:19.522
Here I go.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.491
We have Leanne set up
at the end of the hallway.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.893
She has a recorder.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.294
Amy's coming back here,

34:24.296 --> 34:26.296
and I'm gonna monitor
everything on the DVR.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.498
-[Adam] Take a deep
breath, Anne.
-[Amy] Yeah, you're good.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.168
[Adam] Yeah, we're here.
You're not gonna be...
everything's gonna be fine.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.903
Like, I'm not...
I swear to [bleep]

34:32.905 --> 34:35.705
I'm not usually
a skittish person.
It's just this house.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.707
-[Amy] Yeah. It makes sense.
-[Adam] Oh, yeah.

34:37.709 --> 34:41.011
All right. So why don't you
go ahead and start
asking questions?

34:41.880 --> 34:45.048
Are there spirits present?

34:47.686 --> 34:51.021
How many spirits
are in this house?

34:53.392 --> 34:55.192
What do you want?

34:57.830 --> 35:00.130
Are you trying
to get my attention?

35:01.233 --> 35:04.067
-[Amy] Yeah.
Tripwire is going off.
-[Adam] I see.

35:04.069 --> 35:05.435
[Leanne] I just
got the chills.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.437
Scared right now.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.512
Are you following me?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.548
[Amy] Oh!
That's a big response.

35:19.852 --> 35:22.319
I lost the camera
that she's in the room with.

35:23.055 --> 35:24.488
Camera one is out.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.458
[Leanne] Do you dislike me?

35:29.428 --> 35:31.495
How did you find Leanne?

35:33.699 --> 35:35.332
[Leanne] Do you know
I'm afraid?

35:37.202 --> 35:39.302
[Amy] Do you like that
she is afraid?

35:41.173 --> 35:45.475
Do you know that Leanne
has more control than you do?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.678
Who shakes my bed
when I stay here?

35:50.883 --> 35:52.048
[Amy] I think
you're good, Leanne.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.583
[Adam] Yeah. Come, Leanne.
Come with us.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.418
-Okay.
-[Amy] You were very brave.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.254
[Amy] Thank you.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.889
Um, I'm not gonna listen
to this in front of you.

35:58.891 --> 36:02.192
-Right.
-[Amy] Just... We want to take
everything in context.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.060
but if there's
anything on here,
we'll play it for you.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.095
You were great.

36:05.097 --> 36:06.897
So thank you.
I know that was hard for you.

36:06.899 --> 36:09.266
-[Adam] You did
a really good job.
-[Leanne] Thank you.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.535
-You are braver
than you think.
-[Leanne laughs nervously]

36:18.177 --> 36:19.910
[Amy] All right.
Let's listen to this
real quick.

36:19.912 --> 36:24.047
<i> [Amy] So why don't you</i>
<i>  go ahead and start</i>
<i>  asking questions?</i>

36:26.351 --> 36:29.052
<i> [Leanne] Are there</i>
<i>  spirits present?</i>

36:30.189 --> 36:32.389
<i>  Are you trying</i>
<i>  to get my attention?</i>

36:33.258 --> 36:36.193
<i>  I just got the chills.</i>

36:36.195 --> 36:38.962
-'Cause it went off.
<i> -[Leanne] Are you</i>
<i>  following me?</i>

36:41.300 --> 36:43.233
[distortion]

36:44.369 --> 36:46.603
<i> [Amy] How did you find Leanne?</i>

36:46.605 --> 36:50.674
<i> [Adam] Do you know that Leanne</i>
<i>  has more control than you do?</i>

36:52.211 --> 36:55.412
<i> [Leanne] Who shakes my bed</i>
<i>  when I stay here?</i>

36:55.414 --> 36:58.548
-It makes sense
there's nothing on it.
-[Amy] Yeah, it does.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.417
[Adam] That was not
to scare her.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.620
Like, everything that he did,
or whoever did in this house,

37:03.622 --> 37:06.022
was so that she could see it
and be scared.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.858
It's just is like, "I don't
need to talk. I don't need to
tell you anything."

37:08.860 --> 37:10.026
-[Adam] Right.
-I could just...

37:10.028 --> 37:11.761
my mere presence scares
the [bleep] out of her.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.029
Right. All this stuff
on the floor.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.864
[Amy] I can make these
lights light up. I can...

37:14.866 --> 37:16.566
She just sits down there
and she's scared.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.703
[Adam] Yeah.
It makes sense though,
that we wouldn't get EVPs.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.271
[Amy] It's [bleep] her.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.340
-That's what it--
-It's [bleep] with her.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.874
Like, that's literally what
it's doing.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.343
-He's being a bully.
-Yeah, he's being a bully.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.446
-[Adam] A jerk! And he agreed!
-He's like, "Yeah!"

37:29.448 --> 37:32.182
[Amy] Until she takes
control of that,
it's not gonna change.

37:32.184 --> 37:33.316
Yeah.

37:34.686 --> 37:38.088
<i> [Amy] I can't tell you</i>
<i>  how many cases we do where</i>

37:38.090 --> 37:40.257
<i>  it really just comes down</i>
<i>  to the homeowner.</i>

37:40.259 --> 37:44.861
<i> Like, it's there job to really</i>
<i>  just put things to rest.</i>

37:44.863 --> 37:48.331
<i> I think Leanne, over the last,</i>
<i>  you know, 12 years,</i>

37:48.333 --> 37:51.268
<i>  she has let this thing</i>
<i>  get the best of her.</i>

37:51.270 --> 37:53.370
<i>  There's not anything</i>
<i>  dangerous here.</i>

37:53.372 --> 37:57.407
<i>  What is dangerous here</i>
<i>  is how much this is</i>
<i>  affecting Leanne.</i>

37:57.409 --> 38:00.477
<i>  This is affecting her life,</i>
<i>  and that needs to stop now.</i>

38:02.881 --> 38:04.714
<i>  So we have a lot to tell you.</i>

38:04.716 --> 38:06.283
Um, a lot to unpack.

38:06.285 --> 38:10.220
-And you have a lot of work
to do at the end of this okay?
-Okay.

38:10.222 --> 38:15.025
There were certain things
that we brought up that
did start to cause activity.

38:15.027 --> 38:17.894
Your mother had told us
that she thought

38:17.896 --> 38:19.396
that there was something
in the sub-basement,

38:19.398 --> 38:21.831
or she had, kind of...
she would hear knocks
from there.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.934
And so, she covered up
the sub-basement
with really heavy things

38:24.936 --> 38:26.303
and never opened that closet.

38:26.305 --> 38:29.005
So, of course,
we opened up the sub-basement,

38:29.007 --> 38:30.240
and that's when
we started noticing,

38:30.242 --> 38:32.909
we were getting activity,
kind of, around that opening.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.978
<i> [Amy] Do you know who Ray is?</i>

38:34.980 --> 38:37.347
<i> [distorted voice] Yes, I do.</i>

38:37.349 --> 38:38.348
"Yes, I do."

38:38.350 --> 38:40.050
Yeah. You heard that.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.352
<i> [Amy] Are you Ray's</i>
<i>  ex-husband?</i>

38:42.354 --> 38:43.687
[distorted voice] Yes.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.156
[Amy] There was an answer
after that. Sounds like...

38:46.158 --> 38:47.157
It sounds like "Yes."

38:47.159 --> 38:48.992
I mean, it's Richard.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.160
And, I mean,
your mom feels him.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.195
-She was very clear with us.
-[Adam] Yeah.

38:52.197 --> 38:54.831
-[Amy] But he's not
the one bullying.
-Okay.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.300
We think you have
two situations here.

38:57.302 --> 39:00.003
We think that you have...
you have Richard.

39:00.005 --> 39:04.808
And then, you kind of
indicated to us that when
you first bought this house,

39:04.810 --> 39:07.210
you were going through
some emotional things.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.213
Those kinds of things
make people vulnerable.

39:10.215 --> 39:15.352
And those kinds
of things can cause

39:15.354 --> 39:21.391
a spirit or an energy
that enjoys watching
people suffer...

39:21.393 --> 39:22.759
can kinda hitch a ride.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.195
Like, not necessarily
attached to you,

39:25.197 --> 39:28.965
but hang out with you
because they like seeing
how you react.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.667
Right. And I'm always scared.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.369
-You're always scared.
-There's no confidence.

39:32.371 --> 39:36.406
[Amy] And that... The second
you build up that confidence,

39:37.042 --> 39:39.442
this thing
will get tired of...

39:39.444 --> 39:41.845
He'll be like,
"This is not worth it
to me anymore."

39:41.847 --> 39:43.713
-[Leanne] Right.
-Like, that's why it remains.

39:43.715 --> 39:48.017
-It enjoys watching
you suffer.
-[Leanne] Right.

39:48.019 --> 39:53.823
There is zero possibility
that this thing is going to
harm you, hurt you,

39:53.825 --> 39:55.258
do anything malicious to you.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.926
We can talk to you
all day long about this,

39:56.928 --> 39:58.962
but we do have someone else
who's gonna talk to you,

39:58.964 --> 40:02.832
who's the best pep talk person
we know, Mr. Chip Coffey.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.201
[Adam] Chip, I'm gonna turn
you around, so you can
meet Leanne,

40:05.203 --> 40:07.036
and then, we're gonna
get out of the way.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.339
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
<i> -[Chip] Hi.</i>

40:09.341 --> 40:11.207
It's good to meet you too!

40:11.209 --> 40:16.179
Amy and Adam have shared
with me, a little bit about
what's going on with you

40:16.181 --> 40:18.415
and the house there.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.483
It's relentless.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.253
<i>  Like, what boundaries have</i>
<i>  you placed on these spirits?</i>

40:23.255 --> 40:24.988
I guess, not any.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.424
-I just... I'm just scared.
-What?

40:27.426 --> 40:28.792
<i> [Leanne] I know! I know!</i>

40:28.794 --> 40:32.395
If I came to your house
as a house guest,

40:32.397 --> 40:35.698
and I was being a really lousy
house guest,

40:35.867 --> 40:38.802
and not, kind of, doing things
that you would want,

40:38.804 --> 40:40.837
you would, kind of,
put me on blast, right?

40:40.839 --> 40:44.908
To let me know
that I'm being a really
crappy house guest.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.177
<i>  You're right.</i>
<i>  I have to stop putting up</i>
<i>  with this stuff.</i>

40:47.179 --> 40:49.446
<i>  You've given up your power!</i>

40:50.449 --> 40:52.582
How does that feel to you
when I say that?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.384
I think I'm just intimidated.

40:55.987 --> 41:02.058
I don't feel, psychically,
any reason for you to step
into that intimidated space.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.160
<i>  -Okay.</i>
<i> -I don't!</i>

41:04.162 --> 41:07.263
I mean, I know Amy and Adam
said it's just a jerk.
I get that.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.299
And in my head,
I understand it.

41:09.301 --> 41:12.469
But I'm always,
in the back of my head,
there's this thought,

41:12.471 --> 41:14.637
[crying] "Is it going to turn
on my mother?"

41:15.507 --> 41:17.173
<i>  It's not gonna, at all.</i>

41:17.175 --> 41:18.508
<i>  It's not!</i>

41:19.678 --> 41:23.313
<i>  Because you're gonna handle</i>
<i>  the situation, baby.</i>

41:23.315 --> 41:24.347
<i>  You are!</i>

41:24.349 --> 41:25.815
Okay.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.151
You're the catalyst.
Flex your muscles!

41:28.153 --> 41:31.087
And do it.
Get the job done, girl!

41:31.089 --> 41:32.055
I'm sure gonna try.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.890
[Amy] Thank you,
Mr. Chip Coffey.

41:33.892 --> 41:37.560
<i>  Time and time again,</i>
<i>  these paranormal issues</i>
<i>  come back to emotions.</i>

41:37.562 --> 41:41.431
<i>  They come back to, you know,</i>
<i>  your inner strength</i>
<i>  and your inner energy.</i>

41:41.433 --> 41:46.035
And the only thing
that fixes that is yourself.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.239
<i>  I think the ball</i>
<i>  is in Leanne's court</i>
<i>  at this point, you know.</i>

41:49.241 --> 41:51.774
<i>  I think we empowered her</i>
<i>  as much as we possibly could,</i>

41:51.776 --> 41:53.376
<i>  and she seems confident.</i>

41:53.378 --> 41:55.545
<i>  Sometimes, the only thing</i>
<i>  you can do</i>

41:55.547 --> 41:58.548
<i>  is take back control</i>
<i>  of your own house yourself.</i>

41:58.550 --> 42:00.283
<i>  And she can do that.</i>

42:04.289 --> 42:06.956
