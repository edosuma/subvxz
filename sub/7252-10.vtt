OH, GOODNESS. WHAT'S LEFT

00:05.965 --> 00:09.176
TO WEAR ON YOUR FEET?

00:05.965 --> 00:09.176
I KNOW. IT'S A SICKNESS.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.928
EVERYONE THINKS IT STARTED

00:09.176 --> 00:10.928
WITH BRADSHAW,

00:10.928 --> 00:12.513
BUT ACTUALLY IT CAME OVER

00:10.928 --> 00:12.513
ON THE<i> MAYFLOWER.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.849
WHAT A WONDERFUL HISTORY LESSON.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.849
ANYTIME.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.266
[ MAN SHOUTING

OH, AND LISTEN,

00:24.107 --> 00:25.943
I WANT TO INVITE YOU

00:24.107 --> 00:25.943

00:25.943 --> 00:28.445
ABSOLUTELY. WHICH HUSBAND?

00:25.943 --> 00:28.445
OH, NO HUSBAND, HONEY.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.031
I'M TALKING ABOUT A LOVER

00:28.445 --> 00:31.031
THAT'S BEEN MUCH MORE LOYAL

00:31.031 --> 00:32.867
AND SEDUCTIVE THAN A HUSBAND.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.327
I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:32.867 --> 00:35.327
BUSINESS WE CALL SHOW.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.371
AH!

00:35.327 --> 00:37.371
40 YEARS.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.956

CLEVELAND.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.294
THAT IS OFF BROADWAY.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.672
ANYHOW, I THOUGHT

00:44.294 --> 00:46.672
I'D THROW A BIG PARTY --

00:46.672 --> 00:48.757
FOOD, BOOZE, A LITTLE SONG,

00:46.672 --> 00:48.757
A LITTLE DANCE,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.133
A LITTLE SALSA

00:48.757 --> 00:50.133
DOWN YOUR PANTS.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.468
COUNT ME AND MY PANTS IN.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.720
OH, WONDERFUL!

00:52.720 --> 00:54.763
I WILL EVEN DRAG LUKE THERE.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.558
SO IF THERE'S ANY

00:54.763 --> 00:57.558
AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION,

00:54.763 --> 00:57.558
PLEASE PICK ON HIM.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.560
OH, LUKE WON'T COME.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.560
SURE HE WILL.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.645
I HAVE VERY EFFECTIVE

00:59.560 --> 01:01.645
METHODS OF PERSUASION.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.271
THEY INCLUDE EXTREMELY

01:01.645 --> 01:03.271
HIGH HEELS

01:03.271 --> 01:05.482
AND ALL OF JESSICA SIMPSON'S

01:03.271 --> 01:05.482
BATH PRODUCTS.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.694
NO, HONEY. THE PARTY'S

01:05.482 --> 01:08.694
ON TUESDAY, THE 30th.

01:08.694 --> 01:13.114
SO?

01:08.694 --> 01:13.114
SO THE 30th IS THE DARK DAY.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.575
WHAT DARK DAY?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.952
LUKE'S DARK DAY --

01:14.575 --> 01:16.952
THE DAY THAT HE DISAPPEARS.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.787
DISAPPEARS? WHERE?

01:16.952 --> 01:18.787
NOBODY KNOWS.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.205
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE GOES

01:18.787 --> 01:20.205
OR WHAT HE DOES.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.957
ALL WE KNOW IS NOT

01:20.205 --> 01:21.957
TO TRY AND FIND HIM.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.375
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW

01:21.957 --> 01:23.375
ABOUT THIS?

01:23.375 --> 01:25.252
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.252
EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.087
ANYHOW, YOU COME

02:47.417 --> 02:50.337
PARIS, YOU'RE NOT YELLING AT ME.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.337
YOU'RE YELLING AT THE WORLD.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.839
I'M NOT YELLING AT ALL.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.590
THIS IS THE NATURAL REGISTER

02:51.839 --> 02:53.590
OF MY VOICE.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
IT'S THE REGISTER

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
A TIMID, LITTLE GIRL

02:55.592 --> 02:56.927
WHO IS NOT PUTTING

02:55.592 --> 02:56.927
HERSELF OUT THERE.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.762
I AM PUTTING MYSELF

02:56.927 --> 02:58.762
OUT THERE.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.180
WHY ARE YOU ARGUING

02:58.762 --> 03:01.180
WITH TERRENCE? WHY?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.600
LOOK, I KNOW I HAVEN'T DATED

03:01.180 --> 03:03.600
LATELY,

03:03.600 --> 03:05.435
BUT ASHER WAS VERY

03:03.600 --> 03:05.435
IMPORTANT TO ME.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.521
HEY, PARIS,

03:05.435 --> 03:07.521
I CAN'T FIND MY NOTEBOOK.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.314
THE BLACK ONE WITH

03:07.521 --> 03:09.314
ALL MY YELLOW NOTES IN IT.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.566
YOU HAVE NOT PUT

03:09.314 --> 03:11.566
YOURSELF OUT THERE.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.901
HE JUST DIED.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.569
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.569
HE WAS HALFWAY DEAD

03:14.569 --> 03:16.030
WHEN YOU MET HIM.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.573
RORY, HAS SHE BEEN PUTTING

03:16.030 --> 03:18.573
HERSELF OUT THERE OR NOT?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.450
OUT WHERE?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.450
OUT IN THE WORLD.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.870
HAS SHE TRIED TO MEET MEN

03:20.450 --> 03:22.870
SINCE ASHER DIED?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
YOU DON'T JUST MEET PEOPLE.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.749
I'LL JUST GO IN MY ROOM NOW.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.749
LOOK AT YOUR DREAM LOG.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.627
YOU ARE MONTHS BEHIND -- AND

03:27.749 --> 03:30.627
YOUR PRETTY-THOUGHTS JOURNAL.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.172
OKAY, FINE. I HAVE NEGLECTED

03:30.627 --> 03:33.172
THINKING PRETTY.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.549
BUT I HARDLY THINK I SHOULD BE

03:33.172 --> 03:35.549
PENALIZED FOR TIME LOST

03:35.549 --> 03:37.134
WHILE YOU WERE

03:35.549 --> 03:37.134
IN COURT-ORDERED REHAB.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.178
HEY, PARIS, WHAT'S THIS?

03:37.134 --> 03:39.178
I HAD A BACK PROBLEM.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.262
THE PRESCRIPTION WAS AT HOME

03:39.178 --> 03:41.262
IN MY FILOFAX.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.264
THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM

03:41.262 --> 03:43.264
HEADMASTER CHARLESTON.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.892
WHEN DID HEADMASTER CHARLESTON

03:43.264 --> 03:44.892
CALL?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.393
EARLIER.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.393
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.477
I'M IN SESSION.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.356
HELLO, HEADMASTER CHARLESTON,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.356
THIS IS RORY GILMORE.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.025

03:53.025 --> 03:54.442
I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.570
SWEETIE, THAT WAS A LITTLE

03:54.442 --> 03:56.570
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.946
WE SHOULD TALK LATER.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.865
SO, UM, HOW ARE YOU?

03:59.865 --> 04:02.576
I'm very well.

How are you enjoying Yale?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.869
I LOVE IT.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.412
IT'S EVERYTHING

04:03.869 --> 04:05.412
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.663
IT'S NOTHING LIKE

04:05.412 --> 04:06.663
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.873
IT'S BETTER, ACTUALLY.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.250
I HAVE NO DOUBT.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.250
NOW, I'M CALLING

04:10.250 --> 04:12.460

04:35.442 --> 04:37.736

04:37.736 --> 04:38.904
THAT'S OKAY.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.904
I CAN HANDLE IT.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.447
SO I CAN TAKE THAT AS A YES?
