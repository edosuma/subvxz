Herrera won't stop talking
about spaghetti

02:46.235 --> 02:47.408
and now it's all
I can think about.

02:47.546 --> 02:49.099
All I can
think about is bed.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.308
Any sign of Bishop?

02:50.446 --> 02:51.861
No,
but she was here recently.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.414
The treadmill
was still on.

02:53.552 --> 02:54.622
She's still not
answering her phone?

02:54.760 --> 02:56.176
No.
Hey, Montgomery,
I've got word

02:56.314 --> 02:57.763
you weren't able to make it
to the union meeting earlier.

02:57.901 --> 02:59.040
Chief, I'm so sorry.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.525
- There was a call.
- All right, well,

03:00.663 --> 03:01.940
they're giving you another
chance to plead your case.

03:02.078 --> 03:03.493
Someone will be here
in the morning, okay?

03:03.631 --> 03:05.046
Crap.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.428
Why "crap"? Is--
Isn't that a good thing?

03:07.566 --> 03:08.947
Montgomery?

03:09.085 --> 03:10.880
<i>Aid Car 19 requested
to the north side</i>

03:11.018 --> 03:12.122
<i>of Glendale Lane.</i> Andy: That's us.

03:12.261 --> 03:13.331
What are the chances
they're gonna have spaghetti

03:13.469 --> 03:14.504
waiting for us
when we get back?

03:14.642 --> 03:16.265
Uh, not likely.

03:16.403 --> 03:18.336
This is
the longest shift ever.

03:27.690 --> 03:30.382
Coming through,
on your left.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.866
You found her
by the treadmill?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.213
Uh, yes. Yeah.

03:33.351 --> 03:34.835
Watch her pulling out. Steady.

03:34.973 --> 03:36.906
- One, two, three.
- Got her.

03:37.044 --> 03:38.666
Is her head abrasion
from the fall?

03:38.804 --> 03:40.150
Probably.

03:40.289 --> 03:42.152
I mean, her pulse is slow
and she's breathing, but...

03:42.291 --> 03:44.224
- I came here immediately.
- Okay, let's go.

03:44.362 --> 03:46.226
We'll take care
of your friend. Yeah.

03:46.364 --> 03:47.537
Watch on your right.

03:52.784 --> 03:55.545
Hey.
You got a second?

03:55.683 --> 03:57.892
Oh, boy.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.342
Excuse me?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.033
Uh, the last time
this happened,

04:01.171 --> 04:03.243
you accused me
of drinking on the job.

04:03.381 --> 04:06.901
Yeah, I'm afraid this is
in that neighborhood.

04:07.039 --> 04:11.734
I've been getting reports with
concerns about your leadership.

04:11.872 --> 04:13.080
Let me guess.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.840
Short, blonde,
angry all the time?

04:14.978 --> 04:16.739
She is a-- She's a loose canon,
Chief--

04:16.877 --> 04:19.259
T-This isn't about Bishop.

04:19.397 --> 04:22.227
Have you been taking
a step back on calls?

04:22.365 --> 04:25.851
Uh, yeah, I gave my lieutenant
an opportunity to excel.

04:25.989 --> 04:27.750
Andy Herrera is excellent
at her job.

04:27.888 --> 04:29.234
I just needed to show her

04:29.372 --> 04:31.788
that managing the personalities
of her friends

04:31.926 --> 04:33.618
isn't an easy task.

04:33.756 --> 04:36.276
You know, it was the--
just the one shift.

04:36.414 --> 04:39.279
Yeah, these complaints
started before this shift.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.695
Do I need to be worried about
your ability to lead this team?

04:41.833 --> 04:43.213
No.

04:43.352 --> 04:45.388
Captain Beckett,
there is nothing wrong

04:45.526 --> 04:47.217
with needing a little help.

04:47.356 --> 04:49.047
FD has been focusing
on programs

04:49.185 --> 04:51.014
that tackle mental health
within the department, and--

04:51.152 --> 04:53.016
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:53.154 --> 04:54.501
Okay.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.951
But I don't want another report
like this.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.574
Understood.

05:11.690 --> 05:14.244
If I tell you,
I need "friend" you,

05:14.383 --> 05:15.970
not "dad" you, all right?

05:16.108 --> 05:18.456
Okay.

05:18.594 --> 05:21.044
I told Eli to leak
the Dixon story.

05:21.182 --> 05:22.667
What?!
I know. I know.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.463
I was upset because I didn't get
to the union thing on time,

05:25.601 --> 05:28.500
and then Dixon was there
all smug and Dixon-y,

05:28.638 --> 05:30.260
a-and then I told Eli
to leak it,

05:30.399 --> 05:32.677
but then the union board
said that they were
gonna hear me out.

05:32.815 --> 05:34.334
Hey, I said--
I said friend Warren,

05:34.472 --> 05:35.576
not dad Warren!

05:35.714 --> 05:36.853
Montgomery,
this is not a joke.

05:36.991 --> 05:39.062
Okay, look, man,
i-it's politics!

05:39.200 --> 05:40.512
It's the game!

05:40.650 --> 05:42.203
So I decided to get my hands
a little bit dirty

05:42.342 --> 05:44.585
instead of sitting back and
letting Dixon get what he wants.

05:44.723 --> 05:46.829
We've seen what him getting
what he wants does,

05:46.967 --> 05:48.589
and it's never good.

05:48.727 --> 05:50.591
Okay, yeah, but this is--
it's dirty politics, okay?

05:50.729 --> 05:52.352
That is not you.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.008
Do you have any idea what
this could mean for the station?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.632
F-For Crisis One?

05:56.770 --> 06:00.187
You leaking this confidential
information may jeopardize

06:00.325 --> 06:01.706
the whole program,
which was the entire reason

06:01.844 --> 06:03.535
why you wanted to run for mayor
in the first place.

06:03.673 --> 06:05.330
I know.

06:07.021 --> 06:08.195
You remember when I told you
that you couldn't be

06:08.333 --> 06:09.990
a fraction
as corrupt as Dixon?

06:10.128 --> 06:11.716
Like,
not even if you tried?

06:11.854 --> 06:13.787
Well, it sure seems like
you're trying.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.893
Okay, then I'll fix it.

06:17.031 --> 06:18.723
I'll tell Eli
that we can't do it.

06:20.518 --> 06:22.209
I hope it's not too late.

06:31.218 --> 06:33.013
Stay still.
Get off! Ow.

06:33.151 --> 06:36.568
Keep him down.
Keep him-- Stop moving!

06:36.706 --> 06:39.329
Get off me!

06:39.468 --> 06:41.366
About time
you showed up.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.895
- Okay, let's just take a second.
- W-W-What's going on?

06:53.033 --> 06:54.103
We got a call
from the neighbor

06:54.241 --> 06:55.415
reporting suspicious
activity near the home.

06:55.553 --> 06:56.726
You gotta calm down, son.

06:56.864 --> 06:58.245
Okay?
Please calm down!

06:58.383 --> 06:59.833
Stop moving!
Hey! Hey!
What if we put the gun down?

06:59.971 --> 07:01.628
I don't think
we need the gun.

07:01.766 --> 07:03.353
Officer Jones: We came across
him looking pretty sketchy,

07:03.492 --> 07:04.734
hood covering his face,
walking fast with a backpack.

07:04.872 --> 07:06.736
And when we tried to question
him, he wouldn't stop.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.186
Just started running.

07:08.324 --> 07:09.221
We got him down on the ground
in the ties.

07:09.359 --> 07:10.602
Called you to sedate him.

07:10.740 --> 07:11.707
Okay, how long have you
had him down?

07:11.845 --> 07:13.053
I don't know.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.986
How long did it take you
to get here?

07:15.124 --> 07:16.401
Okay.

07:16.539 --> 07:18.438
Calm down.

07:18.576 --> 07:19.749
Can you just
put the gun down?

07:19.887 --> 07:21.095
Let's just put the gun down,
all right?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.614
- He's not stable.
- In order for us to help

07:22.752 --> 07:24.513
and do our jobs, we can't have
you pointing a gun at him,

07:24.651 --> 07:25.859
or at us.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.723
Okay?
She's right, Smith.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.382
- Stop!
- Thank you, thank you.

07:32.521 --> 07:33.936
What's he saying?
I can't even--

07:34.074 --> 07:36.248
He's-- He's--
He's speaking Spanish.

07:36.386 --> 07:38.043
All right, he's not erratic,
he's just scared.

07:38.181 --> 07:39.631
All right, he doesn't need
to be pinned down.

07:39.769 --> 07:41.322
If you want us to give him
a sedative,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.705
we need to get him off the
ground and out of those ties.

07:44.843 --> 07:47.087
Your move.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.261
It's okay.

07:52.713 --> 07:55.578
All right, let's get her
an ultrasound for a FAST exam.

07:55.716 --> 07:56.993
Crap, her pulse is thready.

07:57.131 --> 07:58.339
Nurse Karen:
Are we starting fluids?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.825
Yes-- two, large bore IVs,
wide open.

08:00.963 --> 08:03.275
She has peaked t-waves
and her QRS is widening.

08:03.413 --> 08:07.728
Let's run trauma labs,
push calcium, and...

08:07.866 --> 08:09.419
- Bicarb and insulin.
- Right.

08:09.558 --> 08:11.387
But we need to make sure first
that she's not hypoglycemic.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.837
Glucometer's
right behind you.

08:12.975 --> 08:15.391
Ugh, pressure's in the 70's.
Add a pressure bag.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.737
Yeah. Yeah.

08:16.875 --> 08:17.945
You know, we should call
an attending.

08:18.083 --> 08:18.946
This is one of
our firefighters.

08:19.084 --> 08:20.845
Married to Dr. DeLuca.

08:22.329 --> 08:24.952
Okay, uh, I think
she has an arrhythmia.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.229
Uh, let's page Dr. Altman.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.403
Blood sugar, 102.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.578
So I'm pushing D50?

08:29.716 --> 08:32.201
Otherwise her insulin
is gonna drop her.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.236
I need a verbal order,
Dr. Kwan.

08:33.374 --> 08:34.583
Yes, push D50.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.205
She also needs
an albuterol neb.

08:36.343 --> 08:38.310
Urine is dark,
low output.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.036
Take that to the lab, STAT.

08:40.174 --> 08:41.969
I'm gonna call and check
on our CT scan.

08:42.107 --> 08:43.177
Good. Okay...

08:43.315 --> 08:44.420
Woman over PA:

08:44.558 --> 08:47.078
<i>Dr. Altman to the ER.</i>

08:47.216 --> 08:49.218
We can't leak the story.

08:49.356 --> 08:51.082
Well, I don't care if you
already put it into motion.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.877
Un-motion it.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.775
Because this isn't the way
that I want to play it,

08:54.913 --> 08:56.846
and I know that I'm the one
that told you to do it,

08:56.984 --> 09:00.229
but I've changed my mind
and I really need you to fix it.

09:01.782 --> 09:04.682
Okay, well, welcome to being
my campaign manager.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.891
Okay, I got to go, Eli. Goodbye.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.168
He said he's gonna try.

09:08.306 --> 09:09.479
Doesn't change the fact
that you did it.

09:09.618 --> 09:12.724
Ooh, excuse me, gentlemen.

09:12.862 --> 09:14.968
Uh, we could use
a little help here.

09:16.003 --> 09:17.315
Oh.

09:17.453 --> 09:18.627
Um...

09:21.388 --> 09:23.839
Woman over PA: <i>Respiratory
therapist to room 342.</i>

09:23.977 --> 09:26.807
<i>Respiratory therapist
to room 342.</i>

09:26.945 --> 09:28.706
Thank you.

09:28.844 --> 09:30.190
I need to find Carina.

09:30.328 --> 09:32.192
All right, page Dr. DeLuca
down to the ER.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.574
Hey,
have her find me, okay?

09:34.712 --> 09:36.403
Have her find me first
because I don't want her

09:36.541 --> 09:37.818
coming down here
and seeing Maya like this.

09:37.956 --> 09:40.614
All right.
Her QRS is narrowing.

09:40.752 --> 09:43.721
Vitals look better.
Head and neck CT are negative.

09:43.859 --> 09:49.002
But her renal function is
abnormal and her CK is elevated.

09:49.140 --> 09:51.107
Has Bishop
had any crush injuries

09:51.245 --> 09:53.731
or any trauma
on any of your calls?

09:53.869 --> 09:56.285
Um, I mean, I haven't been
at the station much lately,

09:56.423 --> 09:59.253
so I-I don't-- I don't know.
I-I don't think so.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.221
Any excessive alcohol
use?

10:01.359 --> 10:02.912
Bishop? No.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.225
Dr. DeLuca is still
in an emergency c-section.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.572
Okay.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.712
Hey, hey, hey.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.127
Hey. Hey.

10:11.265 --> 10:13.060
I'm right here, okay?

10:13.198 --> 10:14.372
How you feeling?

10:14.510 --> 10:16.477
Hey.
Welcome back, Bishop.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.410
You're in the hospital,
all right?

10:18.548 --> 10:20.378
Gibson found you collapsed
by the treadmill,

10:20.516 --> 10:21.966
and he brought you in.

10:22.104 --> 10:23.623
How are you feeling now?

10:23.761 --> 10:25.245
Where's Carina?

10:25.383 --> 10:27.074
Um, we're--
we're finding her,

10:27.212 --> 10:29.283
but I'm gonna be here
until we do, okay?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.463
So, how exactly
did this happen?

10:36.601 --> 10:37.947
And what happened
to the key?

10:38.085 --> 10:40.156
It looks like the key
is broken off into the cuffs.

10:40.294 --> 10:44.505
Well, a woman's business
is a woman's business.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.336
This happened because these two
got me into this mess!

10:47.474 --> 10:49.994
Judith, could you just live on
the edge for once in your life?

10:50.132 --> 10:52.272
I don't need to live
on the edge of nothin'.

10:52.410 --> 10:55.413
I'm not Thelma.
She's not Louise.

10:56.759 --> 10:59.244
Got it.

10:59.382 --> 11:01.799
30 points.
Yes!

11:01.937 --> 11:04.733
Points?
Oh, okay.

11:04.871 --> 11:07.218
Well, um, we're doing
a scavenger hunt.

11:07.356 --> 11:08.495
Uh-huh.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.565
And the winner
gets a cruise.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.015
A-A luxury cruise.

11:11.153 --> 11:12.430
I still hate
both of you.

11:12.568 --> 11:14.018
Oh, you're not
gonna hate us

11:14.156 --> 11:15.502
once you're sippin' daiquiris
in the Caribbean.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.331
Moments like this
I miss Shirley.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.954
- Who's Shirley?
- Nobody.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.856
You look guilty.

11:24.994 --> 11:27.272
I may not be adventurous,
but I'm good at reading people

11:27.410 --> 11:29.758
and you look like a kid who
just stole from the cookie jar.

11:29.896 --> 11:31.311
It's nothing.

11:31.449 --> 11:34.970
Oh, well, that means
- it's definitely something.
- Ooh.

11:35.108 --> 11:37.213
I know the look of shame
when I see it.

11:37.351 --> 11:39.146
I'm used to lookin'
at Gertrude.

11:39.284 --> 11:41.839
You know, I'm just
gonna let that one slide,

11:41.977 --> 11:44.151
seeing we did handcuff you
against your will.

11:44.289 --> 11:45.877
- What do we have here?
- I got it!

11:46.015 --> 11:48.190
- Oh, thank God!
- All right, all right,
all right.

11:48.328 --> 11:50.226
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:50.364 --> 11:52.642
One down,
five to go.

11:52.781 --> 11:54.541
Now, which one
of you gentlemen

11:54.679 --> 11:56.543
would like
to pose shirtless

11:56.681 --> 11:58.718
with one of us
on your lap?

12:04.171 --> 12:07.002
Um, he's-- he's calm.
He's not gonna go anywhere.

12:07.140 --> 12:10.557
So can you get off of him so we
can do a medical assessment?

12:11.938 --> 12:14.009
Please?

12:15.251 --> 12:16.425
Thank you.

12:16.563 --> 12:18.151
- And the zip ties?
- You should keep them on.

12:18.289 --> 12:20.360
Well, we need them off
to treat him properly, so...

12:20.498 --> 12:22.672
- Yeah. All right.
- If he makes one move,
I've already called for backup.

12:25.468 --> 12:27.229
Okay.
Okay, careful, careful.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.921
All right.

12:30.059 --> 12:31.474
I'm just gonna take
a look at you

12:31.612 --> 12:32.993
and make sure
you're okay.

12:33.131 --> 12:33.891
All right,
can you translate?

12:34.029 --> 12:35.478
Yeah.
Uh, i-it's okay.

12:35.616 --> 12:37.066
I understand you.

12:37.204 --> 12:38.412
Okay.
All right, um--

12:38.550 --> 12:39.724
Thanks for getting them
off me.

12:39.862 --> 12:42.831
Of course.
Can you tell us what happened?

12:42.969 --> 12:45.903
I was just,
uh, making pound cake

12:46.041 --> 12:47.801
when I-I realized
we were out of butter,

12:47.939 --> 12:50.908
so I-I went to the corner store
to grab some,

12:51.046 --> 12:53.773
and my mom,
she always tells me

12:53.911 --> 12:55.740
if I ever get stopped
by the police--

12:55.878 --> 12:59.571
h-hands up, be respectful,
never make any sudden movements.

12:59.709 --> 13:04.093
But... I-I get really anxious easily.

13:04.231 --> 13:06.268
- Okay.
- And I-I was s-scared

13:06.406 --> 13:08.442
and they-- they just kept
getting closer to me,

13:08.580 --> 13:09.754
and closer to me--Okay. It's okay.

13:09.892 --> 13:11.031
It's okay.
Just breathe.

13:11.169 --> 13:12.412
Breathe. Um, uh...

13:12.550 --> 13:14.241
you-- you said
you were making pound cake?

13:14.379 --> 13:16.381
Is that your favorite?

13:16.519 --> 13:17.900
It's my mom's favorite.

13:20.730 --> 13:23.078
Tomorrow is her birthday.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.152
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.429
No, no,
none of this is your fault.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.258
None of it.
You were being profiled.

13:31.396 --> 13:32.328
This is not on you.

13:34.365 --> 13:35.124
<i>Gracias.</i>

13:35.262 --> 13:37.920
Okay?

13:40.336 --> 13:45.100
Um, this-- this kid
- does not need to be sedated.
- I know.

13:45.238 --> 13:46.584
And there's gonna be
more cops here soon

13:46.722 --> 13:48.103
and we're gonna
- be outnumbered.
- Yeah.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.588
I'm gonna go to the aid car
and radio for more backup.

13:51.589 --> 13:52.797
- Let's take a look at this.
- What're you doing?

13:52.935 --> 13:54.454
I just
forgot something.

13:56.905 --> 13:58.803
Okay. All right.

13:58.941 --> 14:00.667
Dispatch,
this is Aid Car 19,

14:00.805 --> 14:04.740
requesting a Chief to our scene
to act as a police liaison.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.500
This is now
a Crisis One call.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.438
Hey. You paged?

14:13.576 --> 14:15.268
They said to come to the ER,
but you were not there and--

14:15.406 --> 14:16.994
- No. I'm-- I'm fine.
- Are you okay? Where--

14:17.132 --> 14:18.650
- Okay.
- Everything's fine,
but we were in the ER, and--

14:18.788 --> 14:19.928
We?

14:20.066 --> 14:21.343
Okay, I-I-I have
to tell you something.

14:21.481 --> 14:23.345
I don't want you
to freak out, okay?

14:23.483 --> 14:24.622
What?

14:24.760 --> 14:27.487
Um,
I-I had to bring Maya in.

14:27.625 --> 14:28.971
Oh, my God.
W--

14:31.767 --> 14:34.183
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:34.321 --> 14:35.875
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?

14:36.013 --> 14:38.222
I just-- I just got
a little dehydrated.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.568
W-What is it?

14:39.706 --> 14:41.397
It's a little more
than just dehydration.

14:41.535 --> 14:43.054
Maya has rhabdomyolysis.

14:43.192 --> 14:45.539
When she came in, her CK
was severely elevated.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.886
CK?

14:47.024 --> 14:48.301
It's the marker
for muscle inflammation.

14:48.439 --> 14:49.958
It can be caused
by crush injuries,

14:50.096 --> 14:52.029
certain medications, overexertion.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.754
So you ruled out
any trauma?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.480
Yes, and she's not having
a heart attack,

14:55.618 --> 14:56.896
so I'm just trying to
figure out

14:57.034 --> 14:59.036
what she may have done
that may have caused it.

14:59.174 --> 15:02.177
She's been working out
a lot lately.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.764
Like,
an abnormal amount.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.008
Yes, excessive exercise
can do it.

15:06.146 --> 15:08.045
Okay, I worked out
my entire life.

15:08.183 --> 15:10.219
No more than usual.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.083
- You're sure it's rhabdo?
- I'm certain.

15:12.221 --> 15:13.326
Hey, I'm okay. Okay?

15:13.464 --> 15:15.569
I promise.
I just overdid it.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.571
All right, we will
get this sorted out.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.884
We will put you
on continuous fluids

15:20.022 --> 15:21.713
and keep an eye
on your CK markers.

15:21.851 --> 15:25.441
In the meantime,
try to get some rest, okay?

15:25.579 --> 15:27.098
Thank you. Yeah.

15:27.236 --> 15:29.100
Thank you.

15:29.238 --> 15:31.758
Okay, this is a waste
of a patient bed.

15:31.896 --> 15:33.104
I know you have
some pull around here.

15:33.242 --> 15:34.692
Can you get me
discharged?

15:37.212 --> 15:38.765
- Nice, Gertie.
- This is a lot.

15:38.903 --> 15:40.387
I mean, look at this--
photo in fire gear,

15:40.525 --> 15:42.044
photo in a fire truck--

15:42.182 --> 15:44.874
Video working a fire pole?
Who came up with these?

15:45.013 --> 15:47.532
Well, we do this every year
with our bridge group.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.914
One year it was police themed,
one year it was doctors--

15:50.052 --> 15:51.743
And this year
it's firefighters.

15:51.881 --> 15:53.676
It says to get a photo
with a celebrity.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.540
Well, here you go.

15:55.678 --> 15:58.371
Oh, my word.

15:58.509 --> 16:00.614
You're the young man who's
running for mayor, aren't you?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.478
Mayor Montgomery
in the flesh.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.584
I knew I liked you, Freckles.

16:04.722 --> 16:06.655
You seem to have a really
good head on your shoulders.

16:06.793 --> 16:07.967
Well,
I'm hardly a celebrity.

16:08.105 --> 16:10.072
If anyone, you want
the Fire Zaddy.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.419
- Who?
- Ouch. That's gonna
hurt his ego.

16:12.557 --> 16:14.318
I can hear you, guys.

16:14.456 --> 16:16.976
So I-I can't let you steal
the real one,

16:17.114 --> 16:18.322
but I hope
this one will work.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.082
- 25 points.
- Thank you.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.636
With a name like Fire Zaddy,

16:22.774 --> 16:25.605
you're the one who has to be
in our shirtless photo.

16:27.710 --> 16:30.506
Ladies, respectfully,
you coming here asking us

16:30.644 --> 16:32.992
to pose without
a shirt on is--

16:33.130 --> 16:34.752
it feels a little--Judith: Exploitative?

16:34.890 --> 16:36.409
- Eh, you know.
- Judith, honey,

16:36.547 --> 16:38.756
this is nothing compared
to what we went through.

16:38.894 --> 16:42.484
When I was a cocktail waitress,
I had more hands touching my ass

16:42.622 --> 16:44.589
than a Thanksgiving
- day turkey.
- She has a point.

16:44.727 --> 16:47.937
If the Normandy Park Bridge
ladies win this one more time,

16:48.076 --> 16:51.182
I am going to personally burn
down each one of their houses.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.666
Oh, God. She will.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.358
And then you'll be sorry
you didn't help us.

16:54.496 --> 16:58.086
Well, let's not resort
to arson just yet, okay?

16:58.224 --> 17:00.433
Let's--Look, I'm diabetic.

17:00.571 --> 17:03.022
And I have a family with
a long history of heart disease.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.197
I could die at any minute.
Who's to say?

17:06.335 --> 17:09.028
And Gertie here,
she's beat cancer twice.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.029
- That's true.
- Oh, wow.

17:10.167 --> 17:11.202
Not to mention
the chlamydia.

17:11.340 --> 17:12.652
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- What?

17:12.790 --> 17:15.137
Yeah, the longer we wait
to take this photo,

17:15.275 --> 17:16.552
she could get it again.

17:16.690 --> 17:18.209
Cancer!
Not chlamydia.

17:18.347 --> 17:20.729
And Judith...
well, Judith's the lucky one.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.868
She never had anything
wrong with her,

17:22.006 --> 17:23.663
so we hate her a little.

17:23.801 --> 17:26.907
But if you think that we can't
get you to take this photo...

17:27.046 --> 17:29.979
No....you are sorely mistaken.

17:30.118 --> 17:32.741
Well, look, um,
let's just see what else

17:32.879 --> 17:34.881
we can knock off
this list, shall we?

17:39.437 --> 17:41.646
Are you really not gonna
get me discharged?

17:41.784 --> 17:44.063
Bambina.
Come on.
I don't need to be here.

17:44.201 --> 17:45.581
I'm just
a little dehydrated.

17:45.719 --> 17:46.962
No, you've been
doing too much.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.033
I'm fine.

17:49.171 --> 17:50.724
You're also
the person that brags

17:50.862 --> 17:52.899
about winning a gold medal
on a sprained ankle,

17:53.037 --> 17:54.211
so I don't really trust
your judgment

17:54.349 --> 17:55.488
on if you're okay
or not.

17:55.626 --> 17:57.076
This is nothing, okay?

17:57.214 --> 17:59.561
The only problem is me being
cooped up in this bed

17:59.699 --> 18:01.839
with all these freaking
leads and wires

18:01.977 --> 18:03.565
instead of out
helping my team.

18:03.703 --> 18:05.912
I mean, there was a call,
and they're a man down, okay?

18:06.050 --> 18:08.052
So I need to
get back to work, okay?

18:08.190 --> 18:11.090
So can you just get
these things off of me?

18:11.228 --> 18:13.437
Maya, you're in no shape
to go back anywhere,

18:13.575 --> 18:14.576
let alone go back to work.

18:14.714 --> 18:15.922
Well, I feel fine.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.199
And I'm telling you
you're not fine.

18:17.337 --> 18:18.545
You need help,
you need rest--

18:18.683 --> 18:20.996
Stop telling me
what I need, okay?!

18:21.134 --> 18:23.930
You don't know
what I need!

18:24.068 --> 18:27.416
Now, let me go back to work
or I will go on my own.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.283
Officer Smith: What's going on
with that sedative?

18:32.421 --> 18:34.699
Uh, so, officers, he doesn't
need to be sedated.

18:34.837 --> 18:36.356
He's presenting as calm
and stable.

18:36.494 --> 18:37.978
So--You weren't here
when we first found him.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.567
He was erratic, combative,
ran from the scene. Mm.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.535
He's a threat

18:42.673 --> 18:45.296
which is why
we restrained him.

18:45.434 --> 18:47.540
- It's protocol.
- You don't even know
if he did anything.

18:47.678 --> 18:48.920
He ran.

18:49.058 --> 18:50.232
Okay, well,
that's human instinct.

18:50.370 --> 18:52.131
It's fight or flight,
and dealing--

18:52.269 --> 18:53.649
look, dealing with the police
can be scary.

18:53.787 --> 18:55.410
That-- That's the problem.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.446
See, you think
we're the enemy

18:57.584 --> 18:59.586
when in actuality
it's noncompliance

18:59.724 --> 19:00.967
that gets people killed.

19:01.105 --> 19:02.244
Okay, well,
it's not up to him to know

19:02.382 --> 19:04.384
that his panic attack
might scare <i>you.</i>

19:04.522 --> 19:06.766
Look, officers, I-I do
not think you're the enemy.

19:06.904 --> 19:08.837
I just think your training
needs to change, okay?

19:08.975 --> 19:10.045
If you--
If you took the time

19:10.183 --> 19:11.564
to get to the root
of the problem

19:11.702 --> 19:13.290
instead of defaulting to force,
then maybe we could--

19:13.428 --> 19:14.912
We don't have to explain
- ourselves to you.
- Hughes.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.055
Heard you're giving
my guys a hard time.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.230
Hughes, Herrera, step aside.

19:22.368 --> 19:23.576
- We got it from here.
- No, we're-- we're good.

19:23.714 --> 19:24.922
We're good.
We're just sorting it out.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.682
- Right, officers?
- Yeah, well, now I'm here,

19:26.820 --> 19:29.754
so let's get this guy
down to the station, huh?

19:29.892 --> 19:31.411
- Hughes.
- All right, Dixon,

19:31.549 --> 19:32.688
if you want to get to him,
you're gonna have to go

19:32.826 --> 19:33.758
through both Herrera
and me to do it.

19:33.896 --> 19:34.759
Hughes, what are--Okay?

19:34.897 --> 19:36.244
Don't do this.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.522
Dixon, we've
got this covered, okay?

19:38.660 --> 19:40.248
You're just coming in
and making it worse.

19:40.386 --> 19:43.251
I'm too tired
for the theatrics, 19.

19:43.389 --> 19:44.597
Okay.

19:44.735 --> 19:47.427
Hey, what seems to be
the problem here?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.266
Give me American Gothic.
That's it. Okay, here we go.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.544
Hey, Eli spoke with his people
so we should be good.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.374
Good.

20:03.512 --> 20:04.858
You know what?
Uh, I'm gonna go see

20:04.996 --> 20:06.895
if the others need some help.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.724
- Hey, Ben?
- These things are so heavy.

20:08.862 --> 20:10.761
Is he the reason you were
looking so sad earlier?

20:10.899 --> 20:12.383
I wasn't so sad.

20:12.521 --> 20:14.558
It'd be easier
if you just told me.

20:15.697 --> 20:17.733
All right, fine,
I'll do it.

20:17.871 --> 20:20.736
So Warren is kind of
the station dad,

20:20.874 --> 20:23.705
you know, he's moral
and good and right

20:23.843 --> 20:27.053
and also quick to let us know
if we disappoint him--

20:27.191 --> 20:28.468
and he does it all
with a look.

20:28.606 --> 20:29.745
A look
worse than death.

20:29.883 --> 20:32.023
And Travis has been
a really bad boy.

20:32.161 --> 20:33.715
Okay, shut up.

20:33.853 --> 20:36.200
I made a choice that, at the
time, I thought was right,

20:36.338 --> 20:38.064
but I didn't take
into consideration

20:38.202 --> 20:41.170
how much it would put my friends
in the line of fire, basically.

20:41.309 --> 20:42.517
Who's Shirley?

20:42.655 --> 20:44.070
See, two can play
at this game.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.899
Oh, well...

20:46.037 --> 20:47.522
Well, you may have noticed
that there's only three of us.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.213
It takes four
to play bridge.

20:49.351 --> 20:51.767
We had a falling out
with our fourth-- Shirley.

20:51.905 --> 20:54.183
And now she's playing with the
Normandy Park Bridge ladies.

20:54.322 --> 20:56.531
But she's gonna
come back around.

20:56.669 --> 20:57.704
We've been through
hell and back,

20:57.842 --> 20:59.775
the four of us,
as friends.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.847
And at the end of the day,
we show up for each other.

21:02.985 --> 21:04.055
That's true.

21:04.193 --> 21:05.022
- That's how we've survived.
- Yeah.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.161
At least, I think.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.369
Can't keep
a good ho down.

21:08.474 --> 21:09.406
And Dottie...

21:09.544 --> 21:10.579
She's the...

21:10.717 --> 21:11.994
Uh, we say glue.

21:12.132 --> 21:14.031
- Right.
- The glue.

21:14.169 --> 21:16.896
I swear to God...

21:17.034 --> 21:19.347
...if we don't
win this cruise...

21:19.485 --> 21:21.970
Look, uh...
you're new here,

21:22.108 --> 21:23.799
so I get that you don't
understand how this works--

21:23.937 --> 21:25.939
You know that I was a spotter
in the military, right?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.148
'Cause I see everything.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.600
You've got five officers,
which means you've got six guns

21:31.738 --> 21:33.913
and six Tasers,
yours included.

21:34.051 --> 21:36.225
This guy is trigger happy,
and I know that

21:36.364 --> 21:39.746
'cause he hasn't taken his hand
off his Taser since I got here.

21:39.884 --> 21:41.023
This guy, he's a little
more nervous.

21:41.161 --> 21:42.542
New to the job.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.785
And I know that because
of the way he looks

21:43.923 --> 21:45.234
between his fellow officers,

21:45.373 --> 21:47.306
trying to figure out
what the next steps are.

21:47.444 --> 21:48.721
And this guy.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.101
He's your right hand,
and I know that

21:50.239 --> 21:51.827
because he's been
slowly creeping forward

21:51.965 --> 21:54.382
during this entire exchange,
ready to pounce when needed.

21:54.520 --> 21:58.420
And, Dixon...
you're doing damage control

21:58.558 --> 22:00.422
because you know that
this entire incident

22:00.560 --> 22:03.252
makes your team look unsavory,
which is the same reason

22:03.391 --> 22:05.738
why none of you have
your body cams on.

22:05.876 --> 22:08.465
What makes you think that?

22:08.603 --> 22:10.605
Ask them.

22:11.882 --> 22:13.193
Like I said,
I know how this works,

22:13.332 --> 22:15.817
so if you want to play
this the hard way,

22:15.955 --> 22:17.819
yeah, we can play it
the hard way.

22:17.957 --> 22:19.545
That's your call.

22:21.754 --> 22:23.238
Okay.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.827
Let's play this
the hard way.

All right, all right, all right.

23:09.215 --> 23:10.561
Dottie, are you all right?

23:10.699 --> 23:12.252
All right--
No.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.220
No, I'm feeling a little--

23:14.358 --> 23:15.394
- Sorry.
- We got you.

23:15.532 --> 23:17.361
When was the last time
you ate?

23:17.499 --> 23:18.914
Do I look like
I haven't eaten?

23:19.052 --> 23:20.399
She probably has
low blood sugar.

23:20.537 --> 23:21.710
All right, I got her.

23:21.848 --> 23:22.539
Let's get some food in you,
all right?

23:22.677 --> 23:23.367
Yeah.

23:23.505 --> 23:25.300
Drink your juice, Shelby.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.474
- Bitch.
- We hate you!

23:26.612 --> 23:28.061
She's gonna be fine.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.754
Woman over PA:
<i>Portable X-ray to OR.</i>

23:30.892 --> 23:32.859
<i>Portable X-ray to OR.</i> Hey.

23:37.864 --> 23:39.418
I thought she was dead.

23:42.075 --> 23:44.284
She was just lying there
on the floor,

23:44.423 --> 23:47.080
not moving,
and her pulse was so faint

23:47.218 --> 23:50.808
I-I wasn't even sure I was gonna
make it here on time.

23:53.811 --> 23:55.054
It was Dean
all over again.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.401
No.

23:57.539 --> 23:59.299
And...

23:59.438 --> 24:01.819
I can't lose another person
I love.

24:03.372 --> 24:06.168
I mean,
you know, 19 is my family.

24:07.066 --> 24:10.276
Maya is my family.

24:10.414 --> 24:12.520
And I thought
she was dead.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.460
He's calm now,
so no need to sedate him.

24:21.598 --> 24:23.703
Which means this
is our scene again.

24:23.841 --> 24:25.084
And I don't want to
be here all night.

24:25.222 --> 24:26.326
So let's go, fellas.
Bring him in.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.949
W-- Hey, hold on.
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

24:28.087 --> 24:30.399
He's running!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa, whoa!

24:30.538 --> 24:31.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:31.780 --> 24:33.230
- Get on the ground!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

24:33.368 --> 24:35.266
On the ground!

24:35.404 --> 24:36.613
No, no, no.
Just give him a minute.

24:36.751 --> 24:37.993
Hey, hey, listen to me.

24:38.131 --> 24:40.099
He's-- He's having
a-a panic attack.

24:40.237 --> 24:41.272
He's overstimulated--He's unstable.

24:41.410 --> 24:42.722
He's terrified!

24:42.860 --> 24:44.690
Officer Williams:
Do we know if he's armed?

24:44.828 --> 24:46.726
We did a quick pat down--Okay, we had
this situation handled.

24:46.864 --> 24:48.245
Dixon, just let us
get him home, okay?

24:48.383 --> 24:49.936
Yeah, you try being
a cop sometime, Hughes,

24:50.074 --> 24:51.973
and then let's see
what you say.

24:52.111 --> 24:54.665
We run into dangerous
- situations all the time!
- You run into fires.

24:54.803 --> 24:57.392
Breathe.
- I'm gonna need you to breathe.
- We run into shootings,
stabbings, domestic disputes.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.083
Just breathe.

24:59.221 --> 25:01.465
- Come on, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- This is no longer
your scene!

25:01.603 --> 25:03.156
- No, no, no. No!
- Hey,
get back on the ground!

25:07.713 --> 25:11.095
No! No! No! No! No!

25:11.233 --> 25:12.511
You are not gonna
tase this kid.

25:12.649 --> 25:14.858
Not on my watch.

25:14.996 --> 25:16.480
Herrera,
check his backpack.

25:16.618 --> 25:18.586
Put your hands up
and do not move.

25:18.724 --> 25:21.036
Promise me you won't move!

25:21.174 --> 25:22.279
Stay right there.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.177
I need you
to stay right there, okay?

25:24.315 --> 25:26.007
I'm just gonna check
your bag.

25:28.492 --> 25:30.356
Opening the bag.

25:34.671 --> 25:37.536
Butter, groceries--
groceries.

25:37.674 --> 25:40.366
- Bag's clear.
- Okay. Okay, all right.

25:40.504 --> 25:42.610
So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna

25:42.748 --> 25:46.406
lower your weapons,
you're gonna back up,

25:46.545 --> 25:48.408
and you're gonna go
back to your station.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.410
You're gonna file your report
and you're gonna say

25:50.549 --> 25:54.242
you stopped a kid who was just
trying to get home to his mom.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.795
Because you see
that window back there?

25:55.933 --> 25:56.865
That woman's been standing
in there recording us

25:57.003 --> 25:58.418
for the past three minutes

25:58.557 --> 26:00.869
and she's probably
live streaming as we speak.

26:01.007 --> 26:03.354
So, either you lower
your weapons,

26:03.492 --> 26:06.495
or you're gonna be the top
story in tomorrow's news.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.017
I told you--
I see everything.

26:13.813 --> 26:16.298
Officers, stand down.

26:20.682 --> 26:22.063
Stand down!

26:22.201 --> 26:23.720
Stand down!

26:32.314 --> 26:33.868
That's it, that's it,
that's it.

26:43.740 --> 26:47.536
82. That's better.
You are going to be okay.

26:47.675 --> 26:49.400
Good. 'Cause I gotta
get back to it.

26:49.538 --> 26:50.678
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:50.816 --> 26:53.094
Hold on a sec.

26:53.232 --> 26:56.200
That list will still
be there, all right?

26:56.338 --> 26:57.961
I can't let 'em down.

26:58.099 --> 26:59.721
You're not
letting them down.

26:59.859 --> 27:01.447
They're more worried
about you than--

27:01.585 --> 27:04.243
No, no, I don't--
I don't mean them.

27:04.381 --> 27:07.729
Those-- Those women are not the
"let's drop by the firehouse

27:07.867 --> 27:11.077
and ask men to take off
their shirts" kind of dames.

27:11.215 --> 27:13.666
No, we, uh-- we always
lose this contest,

27:13.804 --> 27:15.599
but this year,
they're going all out for me.

27:15.737 --> 27:19.810
- Oh, yeah?
- Because I lost my husband
of 60 years.

27:19.948 --> 27:21.743
I'm sorry.
Mm, thank you.

27:21.881 --> 27:24.573
And, um,
ever since he died,

27:24.712 --> 27:26.610
I have
a hard time breathing.

27:29.544 --> 27:32.305
Which is funny, you know,
because I spent over 30 years

27:32.443 --> 27:33.548
waiting for that man
to come back

27:33.686 --> 27:36.896
from being
stationed overseas.

27:37.034 --> 27:40.486
And when he'd come home,
I'd plan the best week--

27:40.624 --> 27:44.904
I'd decorate the tree and I'd
- cook all his favorite things.
- Mm.

27:45.042 --> 27:49.633
I loved that man with
every fiber of my being.

27:51.773 --> 27:53.361
Anyway, I just, um--

27:53.499 --> 27:55.639
I don't seem to be able
to catch my breath.

27:57.054 --> 27:59.850
So, um, I've gotta
get myself together...
Mm-hmm.

27:59.988 --> 28:01.990
...and win this contest

28:02.128 --> 28:04.234
and go on this cruise
with these ladies.

28:04.372 --> 28:05.407
Yes.

28:05.545 --> 28:07.927
Because, um...

28:08.065 --> 28:10.378
I owe it to him
to go on living.

28:13.001 --> 28:14.347
And I...

28:14.485 --> 28:16.349
I owe it to myself.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.696
Yeah.

28:20.008 --> 28:21.907
Is she gonna live?

28:23.115 --> 28:24.564
It's dead.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.049
And I don't have my mom's
number memorized--

28:26.187 --> 28:28.810
It's okay.
We'll get you home soon.

28:32.365 --> 28:35.127
I expect a copy of that report
by morning.

28:35.265 --> 28:36.473
You doing okay, Chief?

28:36.611 --> 28:38.475
No.
But I will be.

28:38.613 --> 28:41.547
Just get that kid home
to his mom, Hughes.

28:41.685 --> 28:43.307
You did
good work tonight.

28:43.445 --> 28:46.103
- Thanks, Chief.
- Yeah.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.695
All right.

28:51.833 --> 28:55.216
Not a word.
Not a word.

28:55.354 --> 28:57.252
Okay, look, Fire Zaddy

28:57.390 --> 28:59.565
is not a nickname
I ever wanted, okay?

28:59.703 --> 29:02.568
Taking pictures like this
isn't something I normally do.

29:02.706 --> 29:05.674
I worked really hard to have
a respectable name in the FD,

29:05.813 --> 29:09.230
and, um, this isn't a photo
I want the whole world to see.

29:09.368 --> 29:10.610
I understand.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.992
Only the contest judge
will see it,

29:13.130 --> 29:15.236
and after that,
consider it deleted.

29:15.374 --> 29:19.067
And thank you so much
for making this happen.

29:19.205 --> 29:21.069
Only for you, Dottie.

29:21.207 --> 29:22.588
What,
no applause for me?

29:22.726 --> 29:24.832
Yeah, yeah.

29:24.970 --> 29:26.695
- No, you know what?
- I got this for you.

29:26.834 --> 29:27.869
Consolation applause,
way worse!

29:28.007 --> 29:29.388
Got the applause
for you right there.

29:29.526 --> 29:31.010
Okay, you know what?
I'm keeping these.

29:31.148 --> 29:32.356
First of all,
I-I didn't know

29:32.494 --> 29:33.944
that you needed
two firefighters.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.774
You didn't think I was gonna
do this by myself, did you?

29:35.912 --> 29:37.741
He just wanted someone
next to him so he'd look bigger.

29:37.879 --> 29:39.881
Oh,
this is just too good.

29:40.019 --> 29:41.227
Okay, girls, you're up.

29:41.365 --> 29:43.367
Oh, no, honey.
This is your turn.

29:43.505 --> 29:45.093
Gertrude Rose!

29:45.231 --> 29:46.923
Baby,
this is all on you.

29:47.061 --> 29:49.235
- You, too. Go.
- Oh, all right, let's go.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.306
- All right. Ladies.
- While we're all
still in our 20's.

29:51.444 --> 29:52.894
Here we go.

29:53.032 --> 29:55.241
Okay, here we go.
Everybody say "beefcake!"

29:55.379 --> 29:57.105
Hey!

29:57.243 --> 29:59.349
Get a close-up.
Get a close-up.

29:59.487 --> 30:01.109
- Flex it up, Montgomery.
- All right, here we go.
G-Give me the Fire Zaddy.

30:01.247 --> 30:02.697
- Give me the Zaddy.
- Shirley?

30:02.835 --> 30:04.423
What are you doing here?

30:04.561 --> 30:06.770
Well, Judith called
and said you had a spell,

30:06.908 --> 30:09.290
so I brought you
your medicine.

30:09.428 --> 30:11.085
You broke into
my house?

30:11.223 --> 30:14.571
Oh, hush,
you know I have a key.

30:14.709 --> 30:16.262
Oh.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.645
Well... I'm feeling better.

30:19.783 --> 30:21.267
I can see that.

30:22.751 --> 30:25.306
Thank you...
for the medicine.

30:25.444 --> 30:27.964
Don't make a moment
out of this.

30:28.102 --> 30:30.794
I'm still madder than
a wet hen at you.

30:30.932 --> 30:33.417
Oh, that's okay.

30:33.555 --> 30:35.005
At least you're here.

30:35.143 --> 30:38.181
Well, you gonna give
a girl a turn or what?

30:39.699 --> 30:41.770
Oh, all right.

30:41.909 --> 30:42.841
Oh.

30:42.979 --> 30:44.428
But treat him gently.

30:44.566 --> 30:45.809
Oh, all right,
here we go.

30:45.947 --> 30:47.328
I mean,
we're all here, right?

30:47.466 --> 30:48.639
There you go.
Good squeeze, Shirley.

30:48.777 --> 30:50.987
Good squeeze.
Okay, here we go.

30:58.995 --> 31:02.446
Am I good
to be discharged?

31:02.584 --> 31:05.691
Maya, Dr. Altman and I have some
concerns about your condition

31:05.829 --> 31:08.211
and about the events
that have led to your collapse.

31:08.349 --> 31:11.352
And we both strongly believe
that it's in your best interest

31:11.490 --> 31:12.732
to be admitted
for a few days

31:12.871 --> 31:15.735
until we can get
your numbers under control.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.048
I'm fine.
I'm feeling better.

31:18.186 --> 31:21.914
We both believe it would be best
for you to stay in the hospital.

31:22.052 --> 31:24.296
Well, I'm not staying,
so you can forget about that.

31:24.434 --> 31:25.642
If you're not gonna stay
on your own,

31:25.780 --> 31:28.887
we'll place you
on a 72-hours hold.

31:29.025 --> 31:31.993
What? No. No

31:32.131 --> 31:34.409
We have some concerns that
you would try to leave
against medical advice,

31:34.547 --> 31:36.895
and your situation is critical,
so we need to monitor you

31:37.033 --> 31:39.000
in order to protect
your heart--You're serious?

31:39.138 --> 31:41.382
- You're 5150-ing me?
- Yes.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.108
Look, if you try
to walk out that door

31:43.246 --> 31:45.213
and do anything even remotely
strenuous, you could die.

31:45.351 --> 31:46.905
No, I'm-- I'm fine.
I'm fine.

31:47.043 --> 31:48.768
I feel fine, okay?
Let me go home.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.357
We can figure this out
- at home.
- No, Maya, no.

31:51.495 --> 31:52.772
- Maya, no!
- You can help me at home.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.120
You are not going home.
I can't help you there.

31:55.258 --> 31:58.537
I've tried, but you don't let
me, so this is me helping you.

31:58.675 --> 32:00.711
- No. No. No.
- Maya...

32:00.849 --> 32:01.885
- No, no, wait. You-- No.
- Maya.

32:02.023 --> 32:03.404
- You can't do this.
- Maya, stop.

32:03.542 --> 32:04.992
I am a perfectly competent
and capable person

32:05.130 --> 32:06.407
of making my own decisions.

32:06.545 --> 32:07.615
A perfectly competent
and capable person

32:07.753 --> 32:09.203
wouldn't try to leave
the hospital

32:09.341 --> 32:10.963
against medical advice,
so yes--No. Stop.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.758
- Stop. N-No!
- Maya, I can do this,
and I'm doing it.

32:12.896 --> 32:15.416
Maya, I'm serious!
If you try to leave... No, Carina!

32:15.554 --> 32:16.969
...I will have you
put in restraints.

32:17.107 --> 32:20.386
Please don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

32:20.524 --> 32:22.423
- Wow.
- You've left me no choice.

32:22.561 --> 32:24.218
This is getting--
I need you to--

32:24.356 --> 32:26.392
This isn't support.
This isn't love.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.084
When your brother died

32:28.222 --> 32:29.740
you could barely
get off

32:29.878 --> 32:31.294
the freaking kitchen floor.

32:31.432 --> 32:32.571
You know what I did?

32:32.709 --> 32:35.056
I gave you space
when you needed it.

32:35.194 --> 32:36.955
I let you figure out
your crap on your own.

32:37.093 --> 32:40.096
I didn't call psych
and have you committed!

32:40.234 --> 32:40.959
Okay?

32:41.097 --> 32:42.443
That is love.

32:42.581 --> 32:43.513
That is support.

32:43.651 --> 32:45.273
So, no...

32:45.411 --> 32:46.619
this is not helping me.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.138
All right, Maya,
I want you to lie back.

32:48.276 --> 32:49.622
Look at your heart rate.
You need to try to calm down.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.486
I just-- I can't believe
you would do this to me.

32:51.624 --> 32:54.075
I can't--Dr. Altman is
gonna take it from here.

32:54.213 --> 32:57.389
Oh, the lengths you'll go
to get your way.

32:59.770 --> 33:03.222
If you walk-- If you walk out
that door, we're done.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.500
Do you hear me?

33:05.638 --> 33:07.640
Do you hear me, hmm?

33:07.778 --> 33:08.987
Do you hear me?

33:09.125 --> 33:11.644
You walk out that door,
we are done.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.853
I lose you either way, Bella.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.891
I'd rather lose you
and have you be alive.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.169
N-- Carina! Carina!

33:19.307 --> 33:21.240
How could you
do this to me?!

33:21.378 --> 33:23.553
No, I can't!

33:23.691 --> 33:24.968
Carina!

33:25.106 --> 33:26.659
Carina!

33:26.797 --> 33:29.490
Carina,
how could you?!

33:29.628 --> 33:32.079
How could you?!
Get back here!

Gibson updated us
on some events

34:44.806 --> 34:46.187
that took place last night.

34:46.325 --> 34:48.672
There was an incident
involving one of our own.

34:48.810 --> 34:52.055
He found Lieutenant Bishop collapsed,

34:52.193 --> 34:53.229
and he took her
to the hospital.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.196
She's doing okay now,

34:55.334 --> 34:59.407
but she'll be on leave
until further notice.

34:59.545 --> 35:00.960
Dismissed.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.238
What--
- What happened?
- H-H-Hold on.

35:02.376 --> 35:04.240
Why didn't you call us?
You could have texted us.

35:04.378 --> 35:05.896
She's okay.
She's okay.

35:06.034 --> 35:08.175
She just worked out too hard,
got dehydrated I think,

35:08.313 --> 35:09.762
and, well,
she just needs to rest.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.557
Okay, so she is okay?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.284
Ri--

35:14.422 --> 35:15.906
Montgomery, there's a few folks
from the union board

35:16.044 --> 35:17.356
up in the conference room
waiting for you.

35:17.494 --> 35:18.909
Just do your thing.

35:19.047 --> 35:20.221
- Make me proud, all right?
- Thanks, Chief.

35:20.359 --> 35:21.533
Mm-hmm.

35:21.671 --> 35:22.879
Hey, Warren.

35:23.017 --> 35:26.089
You want to--
You want to tag along?

35:26.227 --> 35:27.608
Yeah.

35:27.746 --> 35:30.197
Gibson, we need someone to fill
in for Bishop while she's out.

35:30.335 --> 35:33.061
You, uh, ready to put
the turnouts back on?

35:36.064 --> 35:37.204
Yeah,
I'm ready to come back.

35:37.342 --> 35:38.653
Glad to hear it.
Welcome back.

35:38.791 --> 35:39.965
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

35:40.103 --> 35:42.001
You're back.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.658
- You're back.
- You remember how
to use that hose?

35:43.796 --> 35:45.143
Come on, t-- What--
Seriously, what happened?

35:45.281 --> 35:46.489
- - No.
- Why didn't you call us?
- Is she okay?

35:46.627 --> 35:48.560
One minute.

35:53.047 --> 35:54.152
Lieutenant.

35:54.290 --> 35:55.429
Captain.

35:55.567 --> 35:56.809
I heard you were
late yesterday.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.467
I was, sir.
I was.

35:59.605 --> 36:01.987
And what makes you think that
that's the type of candidate

36:02.125 --> 36:04.921
we'd want to endorse?

36:05.059 --> 36:07.061
Well, I'm not
a politician, sir.

36:08.856 --> 36:10.685
I'm a firefighter.

36:10.823 --> 36:11.962
I'm the guy that runs
into the building

36:12.100 --> 36:13.240
when everyone else
is running out.

36:13.378 --> 36:15.242
And I know you get that.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.520
It's what we do.

36:17.658 --> 36:21.662
I will try my best to be here
every time, on time.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.595
I just...

36:23.733 --> 36:26.494
may have to save someone
from a fire first.

36:26.632 --> 36:28.531
Yeah, you know,
I told her that I would take her

36:28.669 --> 36:29.808
to that coffee shop
down the street.

36:29.946 --> 36:31.258
That little one.

36:31.396 --> 36:33.087
Are you sure you're ready
to meet your sister?

36:33.225 --> 36:34.364
I mean,
I can go with you.

36:34.502 --> 36:36.504
No, no. I--

36:36.642 --> 36:38.196
I think I need to do
this one on my own.

36:38.334 --> 36:39.680
I can do it, you know.
I'll be all right.

36:39.818 --> 36:40.853
All right.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.338
Hey, bro!
Hey.

36:42.476 --> 36:44.616
Oh, God, I said
the literal worst thing.

36:44.754 --> 36:46.514
I-I-- Sorry.
I'm-- I'm nervous.

36:46.652 --> 36:48.861
When I'm nervous,
I say weird things

36:48.999 --> 36:51.726
and then get hives,
often followed by vomit.

36:51.864 --> 36:54.177
I'm not going to vomit
right now, just to be clear.

36:54.315 --> 36:55.903
Again-- words.

36:56.041 --> 36:58.354
Yeah, you two
are definitely related.

36:58.492 --> 36:59.734
This is Andy Herrera.

36:59.872 --> 37:01.633
She's a-- well,
one of our lieutenants.

37:01.771 --> 37:03.393
Wow, so formal.
Hi, nice to meet you.

37:03.531 --> 37:05.775
You, too.

37:05.913 --> 37:07.466
Thanks for the call.

37:07.604 --> 37:08.916
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

37:09.054 --> 37:10.538
Thank you for the--
the letter.

37:10.676 --> 37:11.988
- You wanna go? Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

37:12.126 --> 37:13.403
Have fun.

37:13.541 --> 37:14.749
Okay, yeah.
Uh, after-- after you.

37:14.887 --> 37:16.717
That was not weird
at all.

37:16.855 --> 37:18.374
Herrera.
Ah!

37:18.512 --> 37:19.996
Hi.
Dr. Grey.

37:20.134 --> 37:21.894
Hi!
The kids wanted
to bake you cookies...

37:22.032 --> 37:23.482
Aww.
...as a thank you
for last night.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.381
And by bake, I really mean
pick up at the bakery

37:25.519 --> 37:26.485
next to the hotel.

37:26.623 --> 37:27.935
That is not necessary.

37:28.073 --> 37:29.557
You--
Are these chocolate chip?

37:29.695 --> 37:30.869
Yeah, you know what?
I'll take them.

37:31.007 --> 37:32.836
Thank you. I w--

37:32.974 --> 37:34.976
Do you want to-- you want
to climb up on the trucks?

37:35.114 --> 37:36.737
- Really?
- I mean, yeah, if--

37:36.875 --> 37:39.947
- if it's okay with your mom.
- Of course. Yay.

37:40.499 --> 37:43.019
- Mm, mm, so good.
- Wow.

37:43.157 --> 37:44.434
How you holding up?

37:44.572 --> 37:46.229
You know, that was
pretty terrifying...

37:46.367 --> 37:48.058
Yeah....but the kids are resilient,

37:48.196 --> 37:50.682
and they love room-service
pancakes.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.166
And the house is
still standing,

37:52.304 --> 37:54.030
so thank you. Aww.

37:54.168 --> 37:55.445
We're just doing our job.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.860
Well,
you do it very well.

37:58.517 --> 38:00.381
Bailey!

38:00.519 --> 38:03.453
I'm sorry that I told Eli
to leak that story.

38:03.591 --> 38:04.937
And I'm sorry that
I didn't think about

38:05.075 --> 38:06.629
how that would affect you
or anyone else.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.251
It was selfish.

38:08.389 --> 38:09.977
Look, I'm just glad you
eventually did the right thing.

38:10.115 --> 38:12.462
- We're good.
- And then they just jumped
on their laps.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.501
I mean, I am just devastated
that I missed that.

38:16.639 --> 38:19.366
- T-They were good sports.
- I was treated like
a piece of meat...

38:20.436 --> 38:21.575
...and I felt delicious.

38:21.713 --> 38:23.301
- Oh.
- What's wrong?

38:23.439 --> 38:26.821
Um...
an article just dropped.

38:26.959 --> 38:29.928
"Deputy Chief of Operations

38:34.450 --> 38:36.797
What?

gonna kill it.

You move on fast.

39:08.622 --> 39:10.589
She was in her 70's

39:13.247 --> 39:16.043
