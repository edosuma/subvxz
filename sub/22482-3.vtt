WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.605
I thought we'd work
in here 'cause, uh,

00:04.638 --> 00:08.276
well, it's the only room
with a table.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.511
Huh. You don't have
a dedicated workspace?

00:10.544 --> 00:13.647
I don't have
a dedicated bathroom.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.184
Can I get you
something to drink?

00:16.217 --> 00:17.751
Uh, you have Coke?

00:17.785 --> 00:20.121
I have cola.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.255
You have Smartwater?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.424
I have sink water.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.527
I'll take the cola.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.330
It's kind of awkward
when the professor pairs you up

00:29.363 --> 00:30.798
with someone you don't know.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.266
Totally.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.567
Well, at least

00:33.601 --> 00:35.503
neither of us got
"Throat Clearing Guy."

00:35.536 --> 00:38.306
Oh, I actually got
Throat Clearing Guy

00:38.339 --> 00:39.640
on the last project.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.309
It did not go so...

00:41.342 --> 00:43.144
(clears throat) ...well.

00:43.177 --> 00:47.781
Anyway, I, uh, figured
we'd do this on my laptop.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.317
Oh.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.853
I mean, unless you have N-voke.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.488
That depends.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.490
What is it?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.692
Presentation software.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.363
Like Powerpoint, only not,
because it doesn't suck.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.734
I have pirated Word '97.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.637
And I used it to write up
the first seven precepts

01:09.670 --> 01:11.705
of conflict resolution
as it pertains to...
Yeah.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.408
Relax. I got this.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.676
Oh, really?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.345
And what do I got?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.746
I can go for some chips.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.614
Whoa.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.383
Not your waitress, Skippy.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.353
Cooper.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.755
I'm sticking with Skippy.

01:27.788 --> 01:31.159
Are we gonna have
a problem here?

01:31.192 --> 01:34.528
Are we?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.539
Good call, Skippy.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.278
Oh, crap. My screen's frozen.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.516
Christy told me you were looking
for an apartment, and I thought,

01:55.549 --> 01:57.251
sure, you could drive
all over Napa,

01:57.285 --> 02:01.889
or... I could save you
the hassle and show you

02:01.922 --> 02:04.692
this little slice of paradise.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.928
What's going on with
the ceiling here?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.398
That's what you call
an architectural element.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.732
Ooh, fancy.
Mm.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.267
What's this all about?

02:13.301 --> 02:15.569
That's drainage
from your neighbor's toilet.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.739
Really?
Don't worry.
Little guy. Doesn't eat much.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.644
So what do you
think? You in?

02:23.677 --> 02:26.680
'Cause I got a polygamist
looking for a sister house.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.682
Well, the sooner
I have my own place,

02:28.716 --> 02:30.384
the sooner I can get Emily back.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.686
I just don't have first
and last month's rent.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.688
Hmm, predicament.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.691
What to do, what to do...

02:37.725 --> 02:39.827
Here's an idea.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.396
You pay me in cash, I'll
overlook the deposit,

02:42.430 --> 02:45.466
and even throw in some furniture
I got in the basement.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.736
Sounds great.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.338
Maybe a fresh coat of paint?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.639
Whoa.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.741
Stand down, Melania.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.346
*

03:11.825 --> 03:14.628
Hang on. I'll get you
a clean fork.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.897
Just gonna walk in a circle
and bring you the same one.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.868
I still can't believe you moved
her into your building.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.336
MARJORIE:
Oh, come on, Jill.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.738
You've been
a great foster mother,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.640
but Emily belongs with Natasha.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.377
I agree. I just think
there's a double standard afoot.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.645
I mean, before
I could foster Emily,

03:31.679 --> 03:33.681
I had to be questioned,
fingerprinted

03:33.714 --> 03:35.716
and baby-proof my whole house.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.652
I still can't get into my pool.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.854
Slap her in that dump
with her birth mother,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.656
and everything's hunky-dory.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.458
That dump is where we live.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.260
I know. I've been there.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.596
She's just out of rehab.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.997
How can she afford
her own place?

03:50.030 --> 03:52.366
She can't. She's paying me
under the table.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.868
What? You didn't
tell me that.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.305
That's what
"under the table" means.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.540
What are they teaching you
at that college?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.913
You realize
that if you get caught,

04:05.946 --> 04:08.416
we're gonna be looking
for a new apartment, too.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.950
Well, Little Black Cloud,

04:09.983 --> 04:13.053
the only way I'd get caught
is if someone ratted me out.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.857
Well, then, somebody better give
me a little taste of the action.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.860
Oh, you want
to wet your beak, do you?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.429
Why are they talking
like that?

04:21.462 --> 04:24.031
Never ask me
about my business, Wendy.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.839
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.892
Pleasure doing
business with you.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.964
So, I was thinking, I should
do the oral presentation,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.699
and you should
manage the visuals.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.067
And wear something pretty.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.772
Right, something low-cut
so we can get a good grade.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.906
Exactly.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.908
And you know what you can wear?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.677
My foot in your ass.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.879
Hey,

05:11.912 --> 05:14.047
I'm just trying to play
to our strengths.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.649
You do what you do,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.718
and I'm super comfortable
speaking in public.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.387
I was in two high school plays,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.054
and I have
my own YouTube channel.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.957
Slow your roll, Miss Saigon.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.727
Several times a week, I stand

05:26.760 --> 05:29.530
in front of a room full
of drunks and drug addicts

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
and share my most
painful experiences.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.403
And P.S., my friend's cat
has her own YouTube channel.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.672
Tell you what. How about
we both do the presentation,

05:38.706 --> 05:40.541
and I wear something pretty?

05:40.574 --> 05:41.809
Thank you.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.644
And show a little cleavage.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.945
We do want the "A."

05:45.979 --> 05:48.482
Hey, I'm a little hungry.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.684
You want to get some wings
or something?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.686
With you?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.822
Don't worry.
We'll split the bill.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.860
Dude, you're kind of a
sexist, hipster douche.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.463
Wings are on you.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.869
You sure nobody's
gonna miss this stuff?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.972
Nah, this was all left behind
by tenants who moved out.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.441
(grunting softly)

06:13.474 --> 06:15.443
Couple of 'em feet first.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.010
Really?

06:17.044 --> 06:20.648
Choked on a chicken bone,

06:20.681 --> 06:22.182
pulmonary embolism.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.619
That guy moved to Fresno,

06:25.653 --> 06:27.187
which is the same
thing as dying.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.423
Come on, give
me a hand.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.191
I don't know how to
thank you, Bonnie.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.827
You just make sure I get
those Benjamins every month.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.763
Oh, and do not
give them to Christy.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.598
She lives in
moral twilight.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.966
(knocking at door)

06:38.999 --> 06:40.668
Oh, my God, that's Emily.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.470
My pits are drippin'.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.505
Relax. You have a
lovely apartment

06:44.538 --> 06:45.906
with a permanent
Christmas tree

06:45.939 --> 06:48.809
and a picture
of a seafaring ancestor.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.612
Hey, honey.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.747
Hi, Mom.
Oh.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.518
Wow!

06:57.551 --> 07:00.721
When you said "back of the
building," you weren't kidding.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.091
Hey, Jill.
Hey.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.726
So, what do you think?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.027
I like it.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.897
You do?
You do?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.499
Come on,
I'll show you your room.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.666
I got you a Harry
Styles pillow

07:12.700 --> 07:14.067
so you can practice
your kissing.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.504
Unless you want a
Katy Perry pillow.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.607
Whatever you're into,
I'm cool with that.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.510
I like green.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.815
Bonnie, where are we?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.216
What are you talking about?

07:29.249 --> 07:31.084
I mean, I was braced
for your apartment,

07:31.118 --> 07:32.720
but this looks
like a place

07:32.753 --> 07:34.588
where they take Turkish
people for questioning.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.624
Hey, it's a beginning, Jill.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.925
Back off.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.093
I'm sorry.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.496
I'm just worried about Emily.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.797
She's a teenager.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.266
All she cares about is a place
to charge her phone.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.570
And that concludes
the grand tour.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.171
Cool.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.873
Is there a place
I can charge my phone?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.877
Right here
by the Christmas pole.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.847
Let me do it. I got a
little shock here earlier.

08:01.649 --> 08:05.152
Okay, well, I guess it's time
for me to be on my way.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.755
Thanks for everything, Jill.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.958
I'm really gonna miss you.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.959
(electrical buzz)

08:11.992 --> 08:13.293
Ow!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.228
I'm all right.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.665
I'm gonna miss you, too.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.833
But we'll still
see each other.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.743
Okay, Jill.
Time to go.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.545
Okeydokey.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.846
Mm-hmm.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.215
Here I go.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.062
(sighs)

08:49.096 --> 08:52.700
Okay, feelings, I hear ya.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.304
(lively crowd chatter)

08:57.337 --> 09:00.674
Sprite for you,
Irish Sprite for me.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.342
Cheers.

09:02.375 --> 09:07.347
Mm. So you have no problem
being in a bar?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.816
No, it's fun.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.283
Actually, I play
this little game.
Mm.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.185
I look around the room
and try to figure out

09:12.219 --> 09:14.722
who I'm gonna be seeing
in a meeting down the road.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.990
Oh, really?
Who do you like?

09:17.024 --> 09:20.093
I got my eye on the guy who
finished his date's drink

09:20.127 --> 09:21.662
when she went
to the bathroom.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.031
Well, maybe
she has the problem,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.766
and he's trying
to save her.

09:25.799 --> 09:29.670
Nope. He just threw
up in his hand.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.004
Nah.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.239
Hmm. Ah.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.007
Oh, God.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.610
Please don't tell me they're
setting up for karaoke.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.012
No, then I'd be
throwing up in my hand.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.347
It's trivia night.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.616
Oh, I am awesome at trivia.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.217
I was raised
by a television.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.319
And I had no friends
except books!

09:46.353 --> 09:49.657
We are gonna crush this!

09:51.792 --> 09:54.327
Your home theater, ma'am.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.099
Courtesy
of the late Mrs. Farraday.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.268
Oh, my God, you're a lifesaver.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.070
Well... if I were a lifesaver,

10:03.103 --> 10:06.874
I would have known how
to Heimlich Mrs. Farraday.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.143
I thought this might lure Emily
out of her room.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.779
(electrical crackle)
Ow!

10:13.046 --> 10:15.115
I'm okay.
God, someone should fix that.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.017
Why would I say that out loud?

10:17.050 --> 10:19.352
She's been in there
since dinner.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.055
Well... I hope Emily
loves Falcon Crest

10:22.089 --> 10:24.024
as much as Christy did.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.225
Good luck.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.694
Oh, no. Please stay.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.361
This is not going well.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.263
She's barely talking to me.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.999
Well, give it time.
When I got sober

10:32.032 --> 10:34.334
and reconnected with Christy,
there were long stretches

10:34.367 --> 10:36.169
of cold, angry silence.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.404
What finally broke the ice?

10:37.437 --> 10:39.206
She punched me
in the back of the head.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.708
Yeah.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.110
(chuckles):
We laugh about it now.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.947
Can you please just...
just stay till bedtime?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.348
(groans softly)

10:48.381 --> 10:49.683
20 minutes.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.084
I'm a busy woman.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.986
I am not wasting my night here.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.723
Ooh, The A-Team.
You got me for an hour.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.058
Emily! Television!

10:59.492 --> 11:01.428
NEWSMAN: We'll have
the rest of your weather

11:01.461 --> 11:03.196
and all the top news at 11:00.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.133
Next up, The A-Team.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.835
*

11:07.868 --> 11:11.839
Which Hogwarts professor was
the head of Gryffindor House?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.775
Who is Professor
Minerva McGonagall!

11:14.808 --> 11:17.845
Okay, again, we're not
playing Jeopardy!, but yes,

11:17.878 --> 11:19.913
point for Team Demi/Ashton!

11:19.947 --> 11:21.481
Oh!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.917
In your face, suckahs!

11:23.951 --> 11:27.220
Okay. Name all
five members

11:27.254 --> 11:28.756
of New Kids
on the Block.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.390
Donnie, Danny,
Jordan, Joey, Jon.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.425
Right again!
Ha!

11:32.459 --> 11:34.461
I still love you, Donnie!

11:35.863 --> 11:37.497
Normally, this is
where I add up the scores,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.366
but I think we can all agree
that the glory

11:39.399 --> 11:42.435
and the free bloomin' onion
go to Team Demi/Ashton!

11:42.469 --> 11:44.905
(cheering)

11:44.938 --> 11:46.907
We won an onion!
We won an onion!

11:46.940 --> 11:49.910
Damn, girl, you own the '90s!

11:49.943 --> 11:53.446
Oh! That's 'cause I'm
the only one here who
wasn't born in them.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.447
You can pick up your prize
at the bar.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.916
Ooh-ooh. Let me.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.417
I've never won an
appetizer before.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.352
Well, raise it high
like the Stanley Cup.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.189
What's that?
Just go.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.191
Thank you.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.193
I never won an appetizer before.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.096
You guys killed it.
Ah. That's 'cause I
watch a lot of TV

12:09.129 --> 12:10.798
and he didn't
have any friends.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.800
You're such a cute couple.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.334
Oh. We're not a couple.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.204
He's just a guy I'm doing
a school project with.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.471
I'm actually 40.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.473
No way.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.342
Way.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.543
Thank you.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.045
Hey, uh, if
you're interested,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.214
give me a minute,
and I'll set you up.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.482
Awesome.
(giggles)

12:29.516 --> 12:31.251
I won you.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.821
Ta-da!

12:33.854 --> 12:35.188
And, as a bonus,

12:35.222 --> 12:37.791
I was just talking to
this girl over there...

12:40.293 --> 12:41.829
You're mean!

12:42.562 --> 12:44.164
I'm so sorry.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.272
We ended up making out
in his car for about an hour.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.275
Look at me--
I have millennial scruff-burn.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.111
Oh, good. I thought
you just did

12:58.145 --> 13:01.281
that thing kids do where they
lick their mouth too much.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.919
How old is this fella?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.387
Old enough to know
what he's doing

13:07.420 --> 13:10.123
and young enough to be
just the right side of wrong.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.192
Are you gonna see him again?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.862
Oh, yeah.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.997
We're going out tonight.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.432
Gymboree or Build-A-Bear?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.869
I think you're jealous.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.238
I pity the fool
who's jealous!

13:25.272 --> 13:28.008
Mr. T. What, do you
live in a cave?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.577
The weird thing is,
when I first met him,

13:30.610 --> 13:32.245
I thought he was a total dick.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.848
Oh, Christy, they all
start out as total dicks.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.183
And they end
as total dicks,

13:36.216 --> 13:37.951
but there's that sweet
spot in the middle.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.854
That's where I am--
between two dicks.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.257
That's where I need to be.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.963
(TV playing indistinctly)

13:51.664 --> 13:54.201
(mutes TV)
Excuse me, young lady.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.469
Where do you think you're headed
on a school night?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.605
Ha-ha.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.608
Oh, come on, I was hammered
the whole time you were dating

14:01.641 --> 14:03.476
in high school--
let me have this moment.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.948
Okay, Mommy,
I'll play along.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.217
Come. Sit.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.990
Now, I know you
really like this boy,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.258
but remember,

14:18.291 --> 14:20.260
you don't have to do things

14:20.293 --> 14:22.362
just because he wants to.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.966
But what if I want
him to like me?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.102
He should like you
for who you are.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.640
But what if I want him
to really like me?

14:33.673 --> 14:37.110
Then you got to bang
his brains out.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.546
We always go one step
too far, don't we?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.648
Yeah. We sure do, kitten.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.916
Have fun.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.017
Bye.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.252
(door opens, closes)

14:45.285 --> 14:48.055
(sighs):
Oh. They grow up so fast.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.929
(knocking at door)

14:55.963 --> 14:57.164
Hey.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.566
Bonnie, I'm a total failure
as a mom.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.035
So am I. Big deal.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
I mean it. I can't do it.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.006
All right, what happened?
Well, I bought a bunch of food,

15:06.039 --> 15:07.307
and then I made
this nice dinner,

15:07.340 --> 15:09.442
and then Emily texts me
she's spending the night

15:09.476 --> 15:11.178
over at someone
named Ashley's house.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.346
Kids do that.
In fact, my daughter's having

15:13.380 --> 15:16.183
a sleepover tonight with
her little school friend Cooper.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.185
But it's our
second night together,

15:18.218 --> 15:19.652
and she didn't want
to come home.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.188
And can you blame her?

15:21.221 --> 15:23.456
I wouldn't want
to come home to me, either.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.160
God, I want a drink.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.628
Okay. Okay.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.197
I got this.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.464
(snaps fingers)

15:31.498 --> 15:33.400
Have a seat.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.534
Wow, you sat fast.

15:34.567 --> 15:39.372
Uh... I thought that was gonna
buy me a little more time.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.274
Oh. I know.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.410
Let's think through the drink.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.545
What does that mean?
Well, let's say
you have that drink.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.015
We both know that means
you're gonna have ten more.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.182
At least.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.517
You lose your sobriety,

15:50.550 --> 15:51.551
you lose your job,

15:51.584 --> 15:54.187
I am definitely kicking you
out of that apartment,

15:54.221 --> 15:55.455
and most important,
you lose Emily.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.292
So you try to get
your act together,

15:59.326 --> 16:00.727
but it's harder
than you thought,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.695
and before you know it, you've
blown through three years,

16:02.729 --> 16:04.664
and you haven't been there
for your kid at all,

16:04.697 --> 16:07.367
and by that point,
she probably doesn't
even care anymore.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.470
So what'll it be?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.571
Gin, vodka,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.740
or one of those
candy-ass microbrews

16:13.773 --> 16:15.708
I never got a chance to try?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.677
Okay, I got it.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.112
Do you?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.647
I'm just scared.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.015
Well, you should be scared.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.416
You've got a lot
riding on this.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.418
I got Christy back
when she was 34,

16:25.452 --> 16:28.188
and I spend every single day
trying to make up for it.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.291
It's a lot of work--
trust me, it's actually easier

16:31.324 --> 16:33.426
to just not drink.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.698
Thank you.
That really helps.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.601
Thank God.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.571
It's still early--
how about we catch a meeting?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.406
I would like that.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.344
Christy's really lucky
to have you.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.314
Natasha, let's
get something straight.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.117
Everybody's lucky to have me.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.719
*

17:11.498 --> 17:13.466
Morning.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.168
Hi.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.605
So... you think
everyone in class

17:18.638 --> 17:20.507
will know we're
sleeping together?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.343
They will
when I tell them.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.345
WOMAN:
Hey, Coop.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.547
I'm doing a load
of laundry--
got anything?

17:27.580 --> 17:29.182
Mom, seriously?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.484
Mom?

17:31.518 --> 17:34.254
Sorry. Didn't know
you had company.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.855
I put the sock
on the door.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.558
Oh, it fell off--
I thought it was laundry.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.094
(sighs)
Hi. I'm Lorraine.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.695
Christy.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.798
I'd stand up,
but my underwear's on the lamp.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.637
Well, I am doing a load--
happy to toss it in.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.406
That's okay.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.242
Y-You know,
I should get going.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.378
You sure? Mom makes
great pancakes.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.718
I do like pancakes.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.688
Can you believe it?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.557
She made me breakfast
and did my laundry.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.759
First time in my life
I came home from a date

18:12.792 --> 18:14.894
and my clothes were cleaner
than when I left.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.130
So, how was the sex?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.698
It's not bad.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.533
But these pancakes...

18:20.567 --> 18:23.736
I'm telling you, she puts
a little vanilla in it, oh...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.672
God, I really felt loved.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.574
Okay, I get it.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.176
I wasn't there for you.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.311
Oh, that wasn't even a dig.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.745
But good.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.915
Okay, so, there's two Ashleys.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.717
There's nerdy Ashley--
she's a doll.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.452
Tall Ashley
doesn't believe in bras,

18:39.486 --> 18:41.254
and she flirts
with all the dads.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.555
No sleepovers with her.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.723
Got it.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.858
The password
for Emily's phone is 4535.

18:45.892 --> 18:49.162
But heads up, she will text
some hurtful things about you.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.531
I don't know what made me
a "foster monster,"

18:51.564 --> 18:53.600
but it still stings.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.867
I just wish
there was someone

18:54.901 --> 18:56.703
who could tell me
I was doing it right.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.838
Well...

18:58.871 --> 19:01.341
for what it's worth,
Emily texted me

19:01.374 --> 19:03.676
how happy she is
to be back with you.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.747
Oh, my God, I
don't believe it.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.583
Hmm. Look, if you have
any problems with her,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.352
don't hesitate to call me.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.953
We can double-team her.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.688
Good cop, hot cop.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.491
Thank you.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.796
Aw. Somebody else
doesn't believe in bras, either.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.536
(exhausted groans)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.638
(panting)

19:31.671 --> 19:33.673
(exhales)

19:33.706 --> 19:37.844
Wow. I've never celebrated
getting an "A" like that.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.247
If I had this kind
of motivation in high school,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.181
I wouldn't have dropped out.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.553
You done with the sheets?
I'm doing whites.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.854
Mom! Are you kidding me?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.956
You must be Cooper.
I'm Mrs. Plunkett.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.658
Hi.
Is that

19:51.691 --> 19:53.993
your Ford Fusion out front?
I hear they get good mileage.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.328
Not bad.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.364
Okay, now you've seen him. Go.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.831
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.866
Hey, Mom?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.569
Mind making us pancakes?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.904
Pancakes? I'm not even
really doing laundry.
