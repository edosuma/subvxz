WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

08:46.817 --> 08:48.608
OH! ALDO!

08:48.609 --> 08:50.740
ARE YOU HAVING SEX ON
MY SANDWICH BOARD?

08:50.741 --> 08:53.823
OUT! AND TAKE THAT DEFILED
CACIOTTA WITH YOU!

08:53.824 --> 08:55.576
WHAT DID HE CALL ME?

08:56.867 --> 08:58.538
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CHEESE.

09:03.253 --> 09:05.835
GREAT, LET'S GO WITH
SEX ON THE BIG CHEESE.

09:05.836 --> 09:09.168
GREAT. SHOULD WE DO
ANOTHER QUESTION?

09:09.169 --> 09:11.511
YEAH, LET'S DO 'EM ALL. I'M
NOT TAKIN' ANY CHANCES.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.847
ALL RIGHT,

09:17.848 --> 09:21.020
IF EVERYONE IS READY, LET'S
GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION.

09:21.021 --> 09:23.312
OH, MR. JUDGE, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU DROPPED YOUR CARDS.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.685
- Joe: HMM...
- OH, YEAH. THANKS.

09:25.686 --> 09:26.857
(grunts)

09:28.528 --> 09:33.072
OKAY, "WHERE'S THE WEIRDEST
PLACE YOU HAVE EVER HOOKED UP?"

09:33.073 --> 09:34.403
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:34.404 --> 09:36.195
NO, I AM NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF

09:36.196 --> 09:38.367
IN FRONT OF THESE TWO.
SKIP TO THE NEXT QUESTION.

09:38.368 --> 09:39.789
BUT JOE AND I KNOW THIS ONE!

09:39.790 --> 09:41.581
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU
"KNOW THIS ONE"?

09:43.123 --> 09:45.374
ARE YOU ACCUSING US OF CHEATING?

09:45.375 --> 09:48.708
LOOK AT WHAT THE FEAR OF
LOSING HAS DONE TO YOU.

09:48.709 --> 09:52.261
RIGHT? MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS
BASED ON ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

09:52.262 --> 09:55.385
UH, AUNT MEL, I CAN SEE A CARD
STICKING OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.679
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA OPEN
A FRESH PACK OF CARDS.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.021
DAMN!

10:03.313 --> 10:05.725
AUNT MEL, JOE, THIS
ONE'S FOR YOU.

10:05.726 --> 10:08.898
"WHAT IS JOE MOST AFRAID OF?"

10:08.899 --> 10:10.150
MMM.

10:11.231 --> 10:12.782
WE GOT THIS.

10:12.783 --> 10:15.115
WE DON'T NEED TO CHEAT...
NOT THAT WE WERE CHEATING.

10:20.701 --> 10:23.502
UM, "CHEESE IN A CAN"?

10:23.503 --> 10:25.044
WHERE-WHERE'D YOU
COME UP WITH THAT?

10:25.045 --> 10:27.376
YOU SAID THAT WAS THE
WORST THING IN THE WORLD.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.918
IT IS, BUT I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.050
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF THEN?

10:31.051 --> 10:32.512
UM...

10:35.015 --> 10:37.216
AGAIN, NO MATCH.

10:37.217 --> 10:39.890
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WHAT JOE WAS MOST AFRAID OF.

10:41.351 --> 10:43.562
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

10:43.563 --> 10:46.025
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S A SHOT.
THERE'S NO PILLS?

10:46.026 --> 10:47.688
JOEY, YOU AFRAID OF NEEDLES?

10:48.899 --> 10:50.029
NO.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.861
NO!

10:51.862 --> 10:54.033
IT'S OKAY IF YOU ARE, YOU KNOW.
EVERYONE'S SCARED OF SOMETHING.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.945
- I GOT A FEAR. -YEAH, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.116
WAX DUMMIES.

10:57.117 --> 10:59.119
WHAT PART OF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT WAS UNCLEAR TO YOU?

11:00.781 --> 11:03.202
- CLEARLY YOU WERE SCARRED.
- (groans)

11:03.203 --> 11:04.744
YOU NEED THIS SHOT, JOE.

11:04.745 --> 11:06.836
IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA
GET BETTER FOR THE DANCE.

11:06.837 --> 11:09.089
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T GIVE
THE SHOT TO MYSELF, SO...

11:10.460 --> 11:12.421
IF I'M GETTIN' THE SHOT...

11:12.422 --> 11:13.963
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.255
AWESOME.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.140
HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?

11:21.141 --> 11:22.512
WATCH A LOT OF GREY'S ANATOMY.

11:24.304 --> 11:25.474
OKEY-DOKEY.

11:25.475 --> 11:26.645
(clears throat) PUT YOUR LEG UP.

11:26.646 --> 11:28.227
I'M RETHINKING THIS.

11:28.228 --> 11:29.769
DO YOU WANNA GET BETTER OR NOT?

11:29.770 --> 11:31.310
OKAY, FINE!

11:31.311 --> 11:33.773
- ALL RIGHT.
- (exhales, clears throat)

11:33.774 --> 11:35.114
OKAY, ON THE COUNT
OF FIVE, OKAY?

11:35.115 --> 11:36.485
- SO WE'RE GOING ON FIVE?
- YEAH.

11:36.486 --> 11:37.777
OKAY, FIVE, ALL
RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:37.778 --> 11:38.948
- ONE...
- YEP, MM-HMM.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.240
- TWO.
- WHAT THE...!

11:41.912 --> 11:44.454
- WHAT HAPPENED TO FIVE?
- OOH, I GOT EXCITED.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.877
SO, RYDER, IN YOUR WORLD,

11:47.878 --> 11:50.880
WHAT EXACTLY DO THE WORDS
"JUST BETWEEN US" MEAN?

11:50.881 --> 11:52.922
I'M HOSTING A SHOW HERE.

11:52.923 --> 11:54.964
COUPLE NUMBER TWO,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.546
"WHAT WAS YOUR MOST EXCITING

11:57.547 --> 11:59.889
ROMANTIC MOMENT
WITH YOUR PARTNER?"

11:59.890 --> 12:02.141
I TOLD YOU NO
INTIMATE QUESTIONS.

12:02.142 --> 12:03.763
PERIOD. END OF STORY.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.186
OH! THEN GAME OVER,
JOE AND I WIN!

12:09.439 --> 12:12.271
JUST FOR THE RECORD, THAT'S THE
GLOATING THAT SHE DOESN'T DO.

12:12.272 --> 12:14.483
UH, FINE, WE'LL PLAY!

12:14.484 --> 12:16.816
OOH, I GOT A GOOD ONE.

12:16.817 --> 12:18.237
A REAL WINNER.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.910
I THINK I'VE GOT THE SAME ONE.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.284
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

12:25.285 --> 12:27.626
WHAT? YEAH, YOU DO.

12:27.627 --> 12:29.418
WE WERE IN BED IN
JOE'S OLD ROOM,

12:29.419 --> 12:31.872
AND HE ALMOST CAUGHT US.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.874
HEY.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.798
I WAS, UH, JUST GETTIN'
DRESSED FOR THE WEDDING.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.010
WHAT'S UP?

12:41.721 --> 12:43.843
JANIE RAN AWAY, ALL RIGHT, SO I
NEED YOU TO PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON,

12:43.844 --> 12:45.684
AND GO AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.

12:45.685 --> 12:46.887
OF COURSE, UNCLE JOE.

12:47.938 --> 12:49.099
HE'S GONE.

12:51.101 --> 12:52.892
I DON'T THINK HE
SUSPECTED ANYTHING.

12:52.893 --> 12:54.523
IF HE DID, I DON'T THINK

12:54.524 --> 12:56.155
YOUR HEAD WOULD STILL BE
ATTACHED TO YOUR BODY.

12:56.156 --> 12:58.068
WOULD'VE BEEN WORTH IT.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.401
I WASN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM

13:02.402 --> 13:04.324
FOR OUR MOST EXCITING
ROMANTIC MOMENT?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.997
IT WAS WITH MARCO?

13:07.998 --> 13:09.909
I WANT TO CHANGE MY ANSWER.

13:09.910 --> 13:11.410
NO.

13:11.411 --> 13:13.462
NO, APPARENTLY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.875
WHAT? NO. ZANDER...

13:15.876 --> 13:17.917
ZANDER, WAIT!

13:17.918 --> 13:19.128
FORFEIT, FORFEIT!

13:19.129 --> 13:20.920
I WILL BE BACK.

13:20.921 --> 13:22.511
(instrumental TV game
show theme playing)

13:22.512 --> 13:25.425
AND WE'LL ALL BE BACK...
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.140
ZANDER, LOOK, I'M SORRY.

13:31.141 --> 13:34.233
OKAY, WILL YOU PLEASE JUST
COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM?

13:34.234 --> 13:37.236
I MAKE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE
AND HE GETS ALL HORMONAL.

13:37.237 --> 13:38.858
YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS. I'LL TRY.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.401
- NO, IT'S LOCKED.
- I GOT THIS. YEP.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.246
ZANDER? ZANDER?

13:47.247 --> 13:48.748
ZANDER?

13:51.001 --> 13:53.712
YOU KNOW, I LOCKED THE
DOOR FOR A REASON.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.955
ZANDER, YOU'RE IN
A RELATIONSHIP.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.796
PEOPLE SCREW UP.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.879
(scoffs) THERE'S WORSE
THINGS THAN BLURTING OUT

13:59.880 --> 14:01.550
THE WRONG NAME AT
THE WRONG TIME.

14:01.551 --> 14:04.014
THAT'S NOTHING, BELIEVE ME.

14:05.515 --> 14:06.926
TELL THAT TO MARCO.

14:06.927 --> 14:08.137
I MEAN, THAT'S WHO SHE
WANTS TO BE WITH.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.428
SHE DOESN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ME.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.310
WHAT? THAT'S WRONG.

14:11.311 --> 14:13.142
ALL SHE DOES IS TALK MY EAR OFF

14:13.143 --> 14:14.274
ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE
CARES ABOUT YOU.

14:15.275 --> 14:17.897
- REALLY?
- YEAH, SHE TELLS EVERYBODY.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.648
WHAT DOES SHE SAY?

14:19.649 --> 14:22.321
WELL, UM...

14:22.322 --> 14:24.743
ZANDER IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!

14:24.744 --> 14:26.575
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
GOING OUT WITH ZANDER,

14:26.576 --> 14:28.537
IT WAS JUST HIS
CONSTANT OVER ANALYZING

14:28.538 --> 14:31.290
OF EVERY LITTLE MOMENT,
IT WAS TOO MUCH!

14:31.291 --> 14:33.162
I JUST RECEIVED THE
MOST MASSIVELY

14:33.163 --> 14:34.994
INAPPROPRIATE TEXT FROM ZANDER.

14:34.995 --> 14:36.205
ONE MIGHT SAY YOU ARE DISPLAYING

14:36.206 --> 14:38.297
SOME POSSESSIVENESS ABOUT
A CERTAIN EX-BOYFRIEND

14:38.298 --> 14:40.590
WHOSE NAME BEGINS WITH ZANDER.

14:42.002 --> 14:44.843
OKAY, FOR THE RECORD, I
HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR HIM.

14:44.844 --> 14:47.556
WELL, NOTHING SPECIFIC
COMES TO MIND,

14:47.557 --> 14:49.008
BUT IN A GENERAL SENSE,

14:49.009 --> 14:51.101
YOU ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO HER.

14:52.852 --> 14:54.064
WELL...

14:56.066 --> 14:57.107
OKAY.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.112
ZANDER IS JUST SO SENSITIVE.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.694
YEAH, BUT ISN'T
THAT A GOOD THING?

15:05.785 --> 15:07.076
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY.

15:07.077 --> 15:08.117
YOU'RE NOT TAKING US SERIOUSLY.

15:08.118 --> 15:09.989
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE US.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.660
WE DON'T HAVE TO BREAK UP
LIKE EVERY OTHER COUPLE

15:11.661 --> 15:13.582
WHO TRIES A LONG
DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.494
THANKS FOR PROTECTING
OUR RELATIONSHIP

15:15.495 --> 15:16.795
BY PRETENDING IN DOESN'T EXIST.

15:16.796 --> 15:18.337
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO ESTABLISH

15:18.338 --> 15:21.090
SOME RULES SO WE CAN KEEP
THIS THING FROM ENDING

15:21.091 --> 15:24.173
IN ANGER AND TEARS.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.256
BRAVO, YOU'VE DONE A
BANG-UP JOB OF THAT!

15:27.677 --> 15:29.008
ZANDER?

15:29.009 --> 15:30.469
OH, HI, LENNOX.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.262
UM, RYDER POSTED ABOUT
MEL'S ACCIDENT ONLINE,

15:33.263 --> 15:34.893
SO I GOT HER THIS.

15:34.894 --> 15:36.435
OH, AND THIS IS FOR YOU.
IT'S HAND SANITIZER,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.857
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
A STAPH INFECTION AND DIE.

15:38.858 --> 15:41.940
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU MEAN A LOT TO...
EVERYBODY.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.523
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME DAY YOU'LL FORGIVE
ME AND WE CAN GET BACK TOGETHER SOME DAY.

15:44.524 --> 15:46.115
OKAY, BYE.

15:46.116 --> 15:48.527
- OH, MY GOD, ZANDER...
- LOOK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.529
OKAY, JUST LISTEN. I'VE GIVEN
THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT,

15:50.530 --> 15:52.701
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT,
AND OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT MINE,

15:52.702 --> 15:54.033
SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT IT'S EMERSON'S...

15:54.034 --> 15:56.165
- WELL, OKAY, ZANDER, NO, I...
- JUST LET ME FINISH, OKAY.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.628
OKAY, I KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST
SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS NOW, AND...

15:59.959 --> 16:01.880
YOU JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.462
OKAY?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.424
'CAUSE YOU HAVE ME.

16:05.425 --> 16:07.176
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ME.

16:07.177 --> 16:08.677
(gasps)

16:08.678 --> 16:10.509
YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME
EVEN IF I'M PREGNANT

16:10.510 --> 16:12.182
WITH EMERSON'S BABY?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.853
YEAH, I DO.

16:14.854 --> 16:17.186
YOU ARE AMAZING.

16:17.187 --> 16:19.559
KINDA CRAZY, BUT MOSTLY AMAZING.

16:21.401 --> 16:22.602
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:23.863 --> 16:25.065
I DON'T DESERVE HIM.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.317
WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH ME?

16:28.318 --> 16:29.948
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH IT.

16:29.949 --> 16:31.871
Both: I'M SORRY.

16:35.115 --> 16:37.116
AW, LOOK AT THAT.

16:37.117 --> 16:38.417
REUNITED.

16:38.418 --> 16:40.620
NOW LET'S DESTROY THEM.

16:42.122 --> 16:44.753
OKAY, EVERYBODY, MARKERS DOWN.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.126
COUPLE NUMBER ONE HAS
FOUGHT THEIR WAY BACK,

16:47.127 --> 16:49.178
AND WE ARE ALL TIED UP!

16:49.179 --> 16:51.131
SO, I WILL REPEAT
THE FINAL QUESTION:

16:52.222 --> 16:53.342
"WHAT WAS THE MOMENT

16:53.343 --> 16:55.725
YOU KNEW YOU WERE IN
LOVE WITH YOUR PARTNER?"

16:57.057 --> 16:59.268
THAT TIME WE GOT CAUGHT
IN THE RAIN AT THE GAZEBO

16:59.269 --> 17:02.731
AT THE LIGHTHOUSE AND YOU
RAPPED "THE SOUND OF MUSIC."

17:02.732 --> 17:04.193
(laughs)

17:04.194 --> 17:06.024
UH, IT WAS OUR FIRST FIGHT...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.316
AND HOW WE MADE UP.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.319
AW, THAT IS SUCH A SWEET ANSWER.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.412
Ryder: NO. SWEET AND WRONG.

17:13.493 --> 17:14.703
AUNT MEL, JOE,

17:14.704 --> 17:16.245
ANSWER THIS CORRECTLY,

17:16.246 --> 17:17.576
AND YOU TAKE THE WHOLE
GAME RIGHT HERE.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.328
BUT I NEED ANOTHER MINUTE.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.500
ME, TOO.

17:22.922 --> 17:24.253
UM, I WAS WONDERING,

17:24.254 --> 17:27.126
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS MAYOR'S
ANNUAL GALA NEXT MONTH,

17:27.127 --> 17:28.377
AND I HAVE TO BRING A DATE,

17:28.378 --> 17:30.129
AND IT'D BE AWKWARD
TO GO WITH MY NANNY,

17:30.130 --> 17:31.550
BUT IN A MONTH, YOU'LL BE MY...

17:31.551 --> 17:33.263
WELL, YOU'LL BE MY NOTHING.

17:34.634 --> 17:37.306
OR YOU COULD BE MY PLUS ONE.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.598
WHOA.

17:39.599 --> 17:42.601
YOU KNOW, I SAW ON THE
NEWS THAT THE AIRPORT

17:42.602 --> 17:44.022
WAS OPEN THIS MORNING.

17:44.023 --> 17:47.236
OH. WELL, YEAH, THE
TOLEDO AIRPORT WAS OPEN,

17:47.237 --> 17:49.278
BUT IF YOU WOULD'VE CHECKED
NEWARK, YOU WOULD'VE SEEN...

17:49.279 --> 17:51.280
NEWARK WAS OPEN TOO.

17:51.281 --> 17:53.493
YOU LIED TO ME WHEN YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T GET A FLIGHT OUT.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.657
HEY, 'TIS THE SEASON.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.201
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

18:02.202 --> 18:03.703
I AM.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.547
ONE TIME A YEAR.

18:09.299 --> 18:11.260
YOU KNOW, I AM A LITTLE
