KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:03.404 --> 00:06.274
My blood is turning you
into a White Martian.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.742
You're Hank Henshaw.
The real Hank Henshaw.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.644
HENSHAW: Hank Henshaw is dead.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.514
I'm Cyborg Superman.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.016
MIKE: What did they do to you?
SUPERGIRL: They took my blood.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.819
KELEX: Hello, Kara Zor-El.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.654
How can I help you today?

00:20.688 --> 00:25.025
Tell me everything
you know about the project
you call Medusa.

00:31.565 --> 00:35.103
I will never get tired
of watching you do that.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.704
-I'm gonna tell her.
-Just...

00:36.737 --> 00:38.306
Let me start it out,
all right.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.408
I'm gonna casually drop
how badass the suit is...

00:40.441 --> 00:42.110
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, yeah, it's like...

00:42.143 --> 00:43.644
"Oh! Oh, this is so good!

00:43.677 --> 00:45.546
"It's like somebody
from the DEO must have
made it."

00:45.579 --> 00:47.215
Enough with the suit, already.
Okay, it's a badass suit.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.416
But I'm the one
in the badass suit,

00:48.449 --> 00:49.850
so I should be
the one to tell her.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.519
-Yeah.
-Tell who what?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.553
Alex...

00:52.586 --> 00:54.622
Um, okay, so we thought about
what you said...

00:54.655 --> 00:55.823
-Mmm-hmm.
-About Kara.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.692
Right, about not keeping
secrets from her.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.295
We talked about it and, um...

01:01.329 --> 01:03.264
I'm gonna be the one that
tells her I'm the Guardian.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.466
-No, no, no, no, you're not.
-Yeah.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.569
No, because
I have something to say,
something very important.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.839
And I'm not going to have
you two hijacking the night

01:11.872 --> 01:15.209
with your vigilante hijinks.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.678
I'm sorry, um, I couldn't
sleep a wink last night.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.514
-No, I can't wait.
-KARA: Can't wait for what?

01:20.548 --> 01:21.349
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:21.382 --> 01:24.718
(HESITATINGLY)
Eliza's glazed carrots!

01:24.752 --> 01:26.154
Oh, yeah.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.655
Yeah, I mean...

01:27.688 --> 01:30.591
Winn was gushing about those
ever since last Thanksgiving.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.560
-Family tradition!
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:32.593 --> 01:34.162
Oh, I'll get it.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.396
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

01:37.298 --> 01:39.467
-Jolly Thanksgiving!
-(LAUGHS) Thanks!

01:39.500 --> 01:41.369
Thank you,
and it's "Happy Thanksgiving."

01:41.402 --> 01:43.737
-Oh, right. Happy...
-What's this?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.339
Oh, that?
You asked for stuffing.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.275
So I ripped open my mattress
and pulled some out.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.211
Oh, uh, well, that's
not quite what I meant.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.814
Kara, is this your friend
from Daxam you were
telling me about?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.483
Yes!

01:55.516 --> 01:56.750
-Um, this is my
adopted mother...
-Dr. Danvers!

01:56.784 --> 01:58.186
It is an honor
and a privilege.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.388
-Please, call me Eliza.
-Eliza.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.357
Well, Kara tells me that
you're a brilliant scientist.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.925
That must be riveting.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.396
I have to hear
about this science.
What is science?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.267
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.503
-What?
-Yeah.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.771
I think Mon-El is
hitting on Eliza.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.507
-No way.
-Mmm-hmm.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.576
And, uh...
He brought stuffing.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.844
Oh, boy.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.146
-Ooh! Mmm-mmm.
-No, please.

02:29.417 --> 02:32.620
(CLEARS THROAT) So...

02:32.653 --> 02:34.922
You really hit it off
with Mon-El.

02:34.955 --> 02:38.792
(LAUGHS) Oh, Kara.
He's chatting me up
because I'm your mother.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.928
-What?
-He likes you!

02:40.961 --> 02:43.364
-Uh, no. No. (GIGGLES)
-Yes.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.899
He's trying to score points
with me to impress you.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.201
There's no way.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.169
Believe me. A mother knows.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.276
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:56.944 --> 02:58.712
Kara, will you do
us the honors?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.814
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.985
So, it is a Danvers
family tradition that,
before the meal,

03:05.018 --> 03:08.556
we go around and we say
what we're thankful for, so...

03:08.589 --> 03:09.857
-ALL: Ah!
-I like that.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.692
Whoever wants to go first...

03:11.725 --> 03:13.227
(ALL MURMURING)

03:13.261 --> 03:15.463
I wanna go first.
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:15.496 --> 03:17.731
(CLEARS THROAT) Kara,
I for one would like to say

03:17.765 --> 03:21.001
how thankful I am to have
such an understanding friend.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.837
-Oh, he's right.
You are so understanding.
-JAMES: You are.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
-No, she's not.
-Yes, she is.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.342
-No, she's not.
-(WINN CLICK TONGUE)

03:28.676 --> 03:30.210
(SIGHS)

03:31.512 --> 03:32.880
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

03:32.913 --> 03:36.450
Yeah, I just wanna...
I just wanna say something.

03:36.484 --> 03:39.387
I'm also thankful for you,
Kara, um...

03:39.420 --> 03:42.556
Because not only
are you understanding,
but you're also gracious.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.691
(CHUCKLES)

03:43.724 --> 03:45.726
Out of everybody who could
have found me in that pod,

03:45.759 --> 03:48.596
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world that it was you.

03:48.629 --> 03:53.501
I'm just going to jump in
and say there are so many
things that I'm thankful for.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.570
And, honestly, I don't think
I've ever really felt

03:56.604 --> 03:59.407
this much like myself
than right now,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.009
and so there's
a reason for that.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.478
And that reason...

04:05.913 --> 04:08.482
Well, that reason is...
(CHUCKLES)

04:08.516 --> 04:10.250
(ALL EXCLAIM IN SURPRISE)

04:15.889 --> 04:18.426
Does that normally happen
on Thanksgiving?

04:22.496 --> 04:24.732
So, last night,
the space-time continuum

04:24.765 --> 04:26.900
ripped apart in the middle
of your apartment.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.704
Which only makes it
slightly less intense
than last year's Thanksgiving.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.373
Any idea what caused it?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.475
Oh, maybe some
extra-dimensional being

04:34.508 --> 04:37.911
just had a craving for
your mom's cranberry relish.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.347
Yes.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.649
Ugh. Okay, time to keep
scanning for tachyons

04:41.682 --> 04:43.751
and other
reality-shredding particles.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.086
All right, people,
holiday is over,
let's get back to work.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.557
Now, question of the day,
what did Cadmus want
with Supergirl?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.859
And why did Lillian Luthor
take your blood?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.627
I mean, why not just kill you?

04:53.661 --> 04:56.897
I think she probably
has something a little
more nefarious planned.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.501
Oh, yeah, those Luthors
do love an epic
criminal scheme.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.404
I just need to know
what Lena knows.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.573
Will do.
I will tap every phone.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.641
I will hack every computer.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.942
No. I'll do it.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.511
I mean, I know her.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.380
I bet you I could get her
to say what she knows.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.483
-How?
-Reporting skills.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.352
And good old-fashioned
sneakiness.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.822
-Solid plan. No problem.
-Yeah, absolutely.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.892
You guys! I can be sneaky
when I want to be.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.094
Definitely.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.729
Sounds like a plan.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.901
-Hack Lena anyway.
-Duh.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.840
So what is this
interview for, really?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.141
Oh, it's a puff piece.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.712
"Women of Power and the
Mothers Who Molded Them."

05:44.745 --> 05:47.080
Oh, I mean, of course,
I'm happy to help, Kara,

05:47.114 --> 05:49.717
I'm just not sure
how interesting my mother
and I really are.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.752
Oh, I'm sure your mother
is fascinating.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.923
Listen, Kara, you can write
whatever sounds good,

05:55.956 --> 05:57.825
but the truth is,

05:57.858 --> 06:01.729
as a daughter,
I always seemed to fall short.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.465
We could never agree
on anything.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.366
What sort of things
didn't you agree on?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.069
Was it with the business or...

06:09.102 --> 06:11.972
Oh, God, no!
My mother couldn't care
less about L-Corp.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.875
What about back when
it was Luthor Corp?

06:14.908 --> 06:18.979
How did she feel
when you changed
the company's direction?

06:19.012 --> 06:22.983
You mean when I changed it
from its "murdering
world domination" direction?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.752
(LAUGHS)

06:24.785 --> 06:27.621
Sure, yes.

06:27.655 --> 06:32.660
It's just, you said to me
once you wanted L-Corp
to be a "force for good."

06:33.594 --> 06:34.995
She has to be proud of that.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.831
Yeah, I would hope so.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.771
Look, Kara, you know,
I'm a complete idiot.
I forgot I had a meeting.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.674
-I trust you will
do us justice.
-Yes.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.842
It's good to see you.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.021
Mom?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.556
We need to talk.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.203
Can I get ya anything?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.938
MAN: No.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.540
Suit yourself.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.848
Wow.
You must be a regular here.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.525
So, are you looking
for some company?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.226
I am very good company.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.061
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.097
And I actually am
looking for company,
but with someone else.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.666
Ah!

07:49.169 --> 07:50.671
I'm sorry, excuse me.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.512
(BEEPING)

08:00.581 --> 08:01.882

08:52.099 --> 08:55.535
-Hey, what happened?
-They're dead!
All the aliens are dead!

09:07.815 --> 09:09.182
Is this really necessary?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.720
I feel fine. I could do
1,000 push-ups one-handed.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.521
While that's very impressive,

09:14.554 --> 09:18.759
we can't risk you transmitting
whatever you were exposed to
in the bar to the rest of us.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.060
Which begs the question,

09:20.093 --> 09:21.328
what the hell
was he exposed to?

09:21.361 --> 09:22.830
Tell us what happened again.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.698
I already...
I told you guys...

09:26.634 --> 09:28.301
(SIGHS)

09:28.335 --> 09:30.904
I saw you.
But not you,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.607
the real you,
the original Hank Henshaw.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.178
I followed him outside,
we fought and I lost.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.715
And then I heard the screams.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.354
If I hadn't
followed him outside,
I could have stopped this.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.056
The only reason
you're still alive

09:49.089 --> 09:52.192
is because you chased
Hank Henshaw outside.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.696
I have never heard of
a weapon, bio or otherwise,

09:55.729 --> 09:57.965
that can target
only alien physiology.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.333
And that thing killed
everything in that bar

10:00.367 --> 10:02.636
except human beings.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.238
I would like to bring
my mother in to help
analyze the crime scene.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.341
She specializes
in astrobiology,
I think she could really help.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.810
That's a good idea.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.780
-Great, let's get going.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.882
You and I will remain
quarantined here at the DEO

10:14.915 --> 10:17.818
until we can figure out
exactly what sort of toxin
we're dealing with.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.787
J'onn, this is Cadmus.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.755
I know it.
They're planning something.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.124
My alien sister
is not leaving here

10:24.157 --> 10:28.261
until we figure out
how Cadmus was able
to target only aliens.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.830
It's better safe than sorry.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.668
(SIGHS)

10:41.041 --> 10:42.876
This is quite
a depressing sight.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.680
I'm used to celebrating
holiday weekends alone
at my desk.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.448
Overworking does run
in the family.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.751
Now I know you're
in the holiday spirit.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.153
Usually that kind of
thought is followed by
the backstabbing jibe

10:53.186 --> 10:55.689
about how I'm not
really a Luthor.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.061
You never let me forget
that I'm adopted.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.231
When it comes
to your children,
Lex was always your favorite.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.736
And you always
your father's.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.037
You sound almost jealous.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.806
You shouldn't take it
all so personally.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.042
No parent truly loves
their children equally.

11:15.075 --> 11:20.814
And though
maybe I loved Lex more,
I do love you, Lena.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.916
In my own way.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.484
Well...

11:24.517 --> 11:27.220
Now that we've got
the pleasantries
out of the way,

11:27.254 --> 11:31.224
let me ask,
what the hell
are you up to?

11:31.258 --> 11:33.927
We've hardly spoken
since Lex's trial.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.765
I thought maybe
you called me here
to make amends.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.800
It's Thanksgiving, after all.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.970
But I see I was mistaken.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.106
There's a reporter
sniffing about.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.842
She's smart.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.846
She knows something about you.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.082
What is it?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.884
I couldn't possibly imagine.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.752
See, I know you're lying.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.954
And how would you know that?

12:00.988 --> 12:02.956
Because you told
me you love me.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.926
And we both know
that's not true.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.097
Thanks for stopping by, Mom.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.401
Oh, crap.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.136
Aw, sucks for you.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.106
My turn.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.841
I mean, please.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.812
And you're in jail.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.079
That feels appropriate.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.516
You'll be out of
here soon enough.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.985
Both of us will.
So don't pout.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.320
(LAUGHS)

12:33.353 --> 12:36.790
Hey, you don't, uh...
You don't like me, do you?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.959
Of course I like you.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.995
No, I mean, like,
you don't "like me" like me?

12:42.029 --> 12:43.997
"'Like you' like you"?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.466
Sorry, English
is my second language.

12:46.499 --> 12:50.904
My mom, Eliza, she...
She thought you were being

12:50.938 --> 12:53.140
extra nice to her
on Thanksgiving.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.476
That's like a thing
that boys on this planet do.

12:56.509 --> 13:01.414
They're nice to the moms
of girls they have crushes
on sometimes.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.116
"Crush"?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.318
Sorry, (STAMMERS)
I'm not following.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.554
You don't want to
mate with me, do you?

13:07.587 --> 13:10.023
(LAUGHING)

13:10.057 --> 13:15.295
Um... (COUGHING) I mean,
have you seen the women
that I've been attracting,

13:15.328 --> 13:18.298
earthlings and otherwise,
since I've been
on this planet?

13:18.331 --> 13:19.466
(CHUCKLES)

13:19.499 --> 13:23.170
-Uh-huh, thank you
for the clarification.
-(COUGHS)

13:24.471 --> 13:27.140
-(WHEEZING)
-Mon-El!

13:30.510 --> 13:32.479
-Oh, Mon-El!
-AUTOMATED VOICE:
Warning! Containment breach.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.047
Hey! Hey!

13:34.081 --> 13:35.883
-Warning! Containment breach.
-Hey! Hey!

13:35.916 --> 13:38.251
-Stay with me! Stay with me!
-Warning! Containment breach.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.286
Help!

13:43.891 --> 13:46.193
-He's stable for now.
-Thank Rao.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.395
-But he is infected.
-(SIGHS)

13:48.428 --> 13:50.163
Did he pass it on to Kara?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.933
The virus isn't transmittable
organism-to-organism.

13:52.966 --> 13:57.070
You have to come in contact
with a weaponized aerosol
in order to be infected.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.271
Well, that's some good news.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.472
There's something else.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.642
I isolated a strand
of the virus
from Mon-El's blood.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.313
Based on the protein code,
I'm fairly certain
the virus is from Krypton.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.249
A Kryptonian virus?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.351
How did Cadmus
even get its hands on that?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.185
My blood.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.956
That's why they needed it.
To get in.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.925
To get into what?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.392
The Fortress of Solitude.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.323
Kelex, what happened here?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.526
Kara Zor-El, there is
an intruder in the Fortress.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.263
Where? Who is it?

14:56.296 --> 14:58.999
You. You are the intruder.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.467
And you will be destroyed.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.295
(POWERS DOWN)

15:38.771 --> 15:41.408
What did you
want here, Henshaw?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.315
(BEEPING)

15:49.416 --> 15:51.084
"Project Medusa..."

15:58.325 --> 15:59.559
Dad.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.228
Hello, Kara.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.596
What do you wish to know?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.098
Uh...

16:06.166 --> 16:08.135
(CLICKS TONGUE) Um...

16:08.168 --> 16:09.402
(INHALES SHARPLY)

16:09.436 --> 16:12.072
What is, uh...
What is Project Medusa?

16:12.105 --> 16:18.478
Medusa, a weaponized virus
that I created for the defense
of the planet Krypton.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.082
Wait, a...
A virus you created?

16:22.115 --> 16:26.519
It was a joint partnership
between the Science
and Military Guilds.

16:26.553 --> 16:31.091
We bio-engineered
the virus to attack
non-Kryptonian physiology.

16:31.124 --> 16:36.496
In the event of an invasion,
Medusa could be deployed
to kill alien combatants

16:36.529 --> 16:42.302
while keeping our civilians
and infrastructure
safe from harm.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.173
Growing up, you told me
your work was saving lives.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.142
I was saving Kryptonian lives.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.779
It was the perfect weapon.

16:52.812 --> 16:56.283
Well, now your perfect weapon
is in the hands of my enemy.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.656
Henshaw stole
the virus's formula from
the Fortress of Solitude,

17:03.690 --> 17:07.627
which means Cadmus
can make as much
of the virus as they want.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.798
An unstoppable bio-weapon
that kills every alien
except Kryptonians.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.333
The news just gets
better and better.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.302
Well, that explains
why Mon-El is still alive.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.470
Kryptonians and Daxamites
share similar DNA.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.771
So, he'll recover?

17:18.805 --> 17:22.409
His immune system
is battling the virus
and he is fighting hard.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.413
But without a cure,
the infection will win.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.416
Well, here's everything
I found on the virus
at the Fortress.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.318
Mom and I will get to work
on it right away.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.320
We'll find a way to combat it.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.588
Are you all right?

17:35.622 --> 17:38.291
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.334
(SIGHS)

17:56.443 --> 17:57.944
So, what is it?

17:57.977 --> 18:01.881
Oh, I've got the mainframe
breaking down the virus
on a molecular level.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.718
No, I mean, I know you've been
trying to tell me something.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.220
Oh...

18:08.455 --> 18:09.522
No.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.159
No?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.328
(SIGHS)

18:16.429 --> 18:17.530
How?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.701
Keeping a secret
disagrees with you, sweetie.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.472
This isn't like that, Mom.

18:25.505 --> 18:29.142
Does it have anything to do
with Maggie?

18:29.176 --> 18:30.677
You mention her a lot.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.347
Oh, my beautiful Alexandra,

18:34.381 --> 18:37.317
why is it so hard
for you to tell me?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.287
I feel like I'm, uh...

18:40.320 --> 18:43.490
I'm letting you down somehow.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.894
Why would your being gay
ever let me down?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.296
(SIGHS)

18:49.329 --> 18:51.731
You always wanted me
to have a regular life.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.535
Alex, look at the life
our family has led.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.239
Look at me,
look at your sister.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.742
I don't think you believe
I ever expected you
to have a regular life.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.914
You were always
gonna be different, Alex.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.816
Because you were
always exceptional.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.486
And I love you
however you are.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.423
Come here.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.526
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

19:24.331 --> 19:28.568
I like this view much better
than the stalactites
at our last office.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.969
(CHUCKLES)

19:30.002 --> 19:34.241
Here, the lives we've been
charged to protect
are always in view.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.377
Kinda reminds me
of the view from my
room on Krypton.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.214
I could see the whole city
from that window.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.785
All the lights,
pods zooming by...

19:49.989 --> 19:51.691
But then again,

19:51.724 --> 19:54.327
I guess I didn't
truly see anything.

19:56.529 --> 20:01.734
All my life I thought
my parents were the good guys.

20:01.768 --> 20:07.740
And now, the more I learn,
the more I see things,
how they really are.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.746
And the more I'm ashamed
to be their daughter.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.749
Kara, your parents
tried to protect a planet.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.718
They tried to save lives.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.754
I'm sure Lex and
Lillian Luthor thought their
intentions were good, too.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.528
Is this their legacy?

20:30.363 --> 20:33.466
Death and destruction
across the universe?

20:33.500 --> 20:37.437
Your parents' legacy
is not death and destruction,
Kara Zor-El.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.006
It's you.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.874
(SIGHS)

20:41.908 --> 20:44.277
-(GROANING)
-J'onn! J'onn!

20:48.348 --> 20:50.817
What's... (GASPS)
What is happening to you?

20:51.618 --> 20:52.619
(GASPS)

20:54.854 --> 20:59.492
M'gann's, uh, blood infusion
saved my life, but...

21:01.494 --> 21:03.262
It also poisoned me.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.633
(GRUNTS)

21:07.634 --> 21:08.635
I'm, uh...

21:10.603 --> 21:12.839
I'm turning into
a White Martian.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.308
Oh, my God.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.645
But Alex and Eliza,
they can find a cure,
we can fix this.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.880
The priority
has to be Medusa.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.916
I don't want them or
anybody else being distracted
from the primary mission.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.553
We have to stop Cadmus.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.390
We found out how Cadmus
intends to weaponize Medusa.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.560
They need a dispersion agent,
one not available
on our planet,

21:33.593 --> 21:36.396
but there is an
analogous element,
Isotope 454.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.632
Which is incredibly rare
because it's made
exclusively by L-Corp.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.100
If Cadmus gets
their hands on it,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.470
they'll be able
to spread the virus
across the entire city.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.672
There's nothing we'll be
able to do to stop them.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.543
Maggie?

21:50.577 --> 21:53.513
Get every available unit
you have to L-Corp now.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.353
-(DETECTOR BEEPING)

Who's gonna come
and save you?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.859
Did you secure the isotope
from L-Corp?

23:46.893 --> 23:50.597
No. No, but Henshaw
didn't get it either.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.698
How's Mon-El?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.500
He's not getting better,
sweetie.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.535
And we're no closer to a cure.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.671
There's got to be something
on that crystal from
the Fortress that'll help.

23:58.705 --> 24:03.075
So far there's plenty
describing how to synthesize
and disseminate the virus.

24:03.109 --> 24:07.514
But I... I don't think
they ever even
considered a cure.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.582
-What about Lena Luthor?
-What about her?

24:09.616 --> 24:14.186
Lena's mother took
the Kryptonian virus
and synthesized it on Earth.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.722
If Lena is working with her...

24:15.755 --> 24:17.490
Lena was shocked
to see Henshaw.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.758
He would've killed her, too.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.560
Ah, the Luthors
are pretty good actors.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.861
Or, well, sociopaths.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.530
Either way, they know
how to fool people.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.264
No, no.
I looked into Lena's eyes.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.834
She doesn't know anything
about Cadmus and her mother.

24:27.867 --> 24:28.735
I know it.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.770
Would you stake
Mon-El's life on that?

24:39.746 --> 24:43.249
(CHUCKLING) You know that
door's not really an entrance.

24:43.282 --> 24:46.519
Yeah, actually,
I just wanted to thank you
for earlier on.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.255
Not only did you save
the lives of countless numbers
of my employees,

24:49.288 --> 24:50.623
but mine as well.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.959
-Now I need your help.
-Anything.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.061
I need help
finding your mother.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.063
My mother?

24:57.096 --> 25:01.033
Your mother is behind Cadmus.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.535
She's their leader.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.309
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.978
She kidnapped me.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.913
And now she possesses a virus
that she could wipe out

25:13.946 --> 25:16.749
the entire alien population
of National City.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.185
I need you to
help me find her,

25:19.218 --> 25:21.621
so that she doesn't hurt
any more innocent people.

25:23.656 --> 25:27.594
You know, I thought
you were different.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.028
You wear that symbol
on your chest

25:29.061 --> 25:32.164
and everyone thinks
you're good.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.602
How many times
did your cousin put on
that high-and-mighty costume

25:35.635 --> 25:37.704
and come after Lex?

25:39.772 --> 25:41.908
My mother is no saint,

25:41.941 --> 25:46.613
but you come in here
and accuse her of being
the Devil incarnate?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.148
How long before
you come after me?

25:49.181 --> 25:53.052
I know what it's like
to be disillusioned
by our parents.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.323
But I'm a pretty good
judge of character.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.892
And you are not
like your mother.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.162
She is cold and dangerous.

26:03.195 --> 26:07.600
And you are too good
and too smart
to follow in her path.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.604
Be your own hero.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.145
You can leave
the same way you came in.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.294
Sorry. You okay?

26:35.327 --> 26:36.929
Oh, I'm okay.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.731
Just a little nervous,
you're not very good at this.

26:38.765 --> 26:42.669
Oh, well, clearly the drugs
have kicked in,

26:42.702 --> 26:46.739
because you are done.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.942
Thank you.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.077
No.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
Thank you.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.715
For what?

26:56.248 --> 26:57.383
Well...

26:57.416 --> 26:59.652
I told my mom.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.220
You did?
How did she take it?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.856
-Better than me.
-(CHUCKLES)

27:03.890 --> 27:10.763
You know,
when you first suggested
that I was gay, I, uh...

27:10.797 --> 27:12.131
I denied it.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.434
And then I thought
that it was just about you.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.237
I mean,
how could I not like you?

27:18.270 --> 27:22.909
But, you know,
deep down, I think I
still wasn't comfortable

27:22.942 --> 27:25.244
that that was my new normal.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.783
But it is my new normal.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.053
And I'm happy that it is.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.255
'Cause, um...

27:36.288 --> 27:41.127
I, uh... I don't know,
I finally... I get me.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.764
And now I realize
that it wasn't about you,

27:44.797 --> 27:49.168
but it's about
me living my life.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.105
So, thank you.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.842
Anytime.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.289
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:10.322 --> 28:14.226
Did you learn a new power
where you can
duplicate yourself?

28:14.260 --> 28:16.863
-Because I'm seeing two of you
and it's really cool.
-No.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.867
(LAUGHS) No, sorry.
No new powers. Just...

28:20.900 --> 28:22.969
I think the double vision
is all you.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.104
-Oh, so I have a new power?
-Yeah.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.042
Your Earth mother, Eliza,
she thinks I'm dying.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.882
I might not have your hearing,
but mine's pretty good.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.917
She's gonna find a cure.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.186
It's okay.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.255
I've, uh...

28:43.289 --> 28:45.892
I've cheated death
more times than anyone should.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.526
It's not okay,
you shouldn't be dying.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.162
The only reason you are dying
is because of my family.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.199
-Eliza did her best.
-No. Not her.

28:55.802 --> 28:59.138
My birth father
created Medusa.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.375
He's the reason
you are in so much pain,

29:03.409 --> 29:06.212
and he's the reason that
I can't do anything about it.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.783
(SIGHS)

29:15.521 --> 29:18.791
You know, you look beautiful,

29:20.259 --> 29:22.795
with the weight
of all these worlds
on your shoulder.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.131
You don't have to
make me feel better.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.147
Yeah.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.350
Absolutely beautiful.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.362
Twice in one day.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.131
It's almost like we have
a real mother-daughter
relationship.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.969
The Medusa virus.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.937
That's why you sent
your goon here.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.406
For Isotope 454.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.310
You're in charge of Cadmus.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.312
Is this the part
where you lecture me,

30:13.345 --> 30:14.947
like you'd lecture Lex?

30:18.484 --> 30:19.852
No.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.356
What you said before,

30:25.591 --> 30:27.226
there was truth in that.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.298
Ask me for my help
and I'll give it to you.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.201
It's that easy?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.037
It's that easy.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.078
I didn't think you believed
in the cause.

30:46.112 --> 30:49.315
Then maybe it's time
you got to know your daughter
a little better.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.352
(ALARM BEEPING)

30:53.385 --> 30:54.386
What is it?

30:54.420 --> 30:56.088
The radiological alarm.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.157
Isotope 454
has a radioactive signature.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.959
So I set a program
to alert us

30:59.992 --> 31:02.361
if it was ever moved
from the stockpile at L-Corp,
and...

31:02.394 --> 31:03.629
Let me guess.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.097
It's moving?

31:05.131 --> 31:06.198
And how.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.634
Looks like Cadmus is preparing
to release the virus

31:08.667 --> 31:10.402
at the Port of National City.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.670
But why?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.472
The Port isn't a drinkable
water supply.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.075
It's the perfect place to
launch the virus in the air.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.610
Disperse it right across
National City.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.512
Tonight, our nightmare ends.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.647
Tonight, every alien

31:21.680 --> 31:24.250
who has stepped foot
on our planet will die.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.252
Because Earth
is for the humans.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.988
The future is for the humans.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.123
We are Cadmus.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.691
We have to move.
Right now.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.461
Call Alex and get
a strike team to meet me
at the Port now.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.964
There's no time, Supergirl.
It's just you and me.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.665
J'onn, you can't go out there.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.068
-If the virus spreads...
-I'll die, I know.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.269
But it's a fate
I'm willing to accept.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.238
No. I am not gonna let you
do this.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.673
I know you're upset
about what's happening to you,

31:47.706 --> 31:50.409
but I'm not gonna let you go
on some kamikaze mission.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.079
Kara, if I die,
I want to die as myself.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.680
Fighting for
what I believe in.

31:54.713 --> 31:57.649
Not as some mutant
horror show.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.686
Let me share the fate of
my alien brothers and sisters,

32:00.719 --> 32:02.054
come what may.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.405
Some mothers wear lockets with
pictures of their children.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.940
You wear the keys
to a bazooka.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.476
It's a rocket launcher.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.214
And it's yours.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.017
Take it.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.418
Prove you're with me.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.720
Unleash Medusa
and end Earth's alien menace

32:34.753 --> 32:36.222
once and for all.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.703
-Don't do it, Lena.
-Why not?

32:51.737 --> 32:53.105
I'm a Luthor.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.349
Go, I've got this.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.186
You two are finished.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.587
You're wrong about that.

back to hell.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.173
You're finally right, Henshaw.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.576
I am a monster.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.616
You may be a cyborg,

but you are no Superman.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.499
I'm coming, M'yri'ah.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.419

35:56.755 --> 35:58.224
They should be dead.

All aliens should be dead.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.698
You.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.268
You switched out the isotope.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.403
You made the virus inert.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.571
I did.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.275
And I called the police.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.210
(SIRENS WAILING)

36:26.952 --> 36:28.554
You're okay.

36:36.728 --> 36:37.796
He's gone.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.447

36:55.481 --> 36:56.882
We've reached
the Well of Stars.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.317
BOTH: And?

36:58.350 --> 36:59.951
There is no sign
of the Kryptonian pod.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.587
BOTH: Find it.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.322
The ion trail has dissipated.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.291
I would not know
where to look.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.426
BOTH: Find it.

37:07.459 --> 37:10.662
BOTH: I do not care
how much space we must cross.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.298
How many lives we lose,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.500
or how many suns we burn.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.369
Mon-El of Daxam will be found.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.709
Am I dead?

37:23.742 --> 37:24.843
Is this heaven?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.878
(CHUCKLES) No.

37:26.912 --> 37:30.749
We were able to reverse
engineer a cure from a
living sample of the virus.

she really means "she."

37:34.320 --> 37:36.422
But Winn and I watched
enthusiastically.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.024
While this is good news,
it gets even better.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.427
The Medusa virus
was so easily weaponized

37:41.460 --> 37:43.762
I was able to turn it
against a common enemy,

You know,
I didn't come here for work.

Well, here's the thing. I...

39:40.546 --> 39:41.880

39:41.913 --> 39:43.749
Uh, yeah. No, I would not have
let that happen.

39:43.782 --> 39:47.085
Wait. I know that, but, um...

39:47.118 --> 39:49.655
It got me thinking that I...

39:50.922 --> 39:52.491
I was so stupid.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.626
I thought that...

39:54.660 --> 39:56.662
And I guess
I was kind of right,

39:56.695 --> 39:58.597
that you came out for me.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.934
And that scared me.

40:02.968 --> 40:03.969
Um...

40:05.771 --> 40:06.938
But, um...

40:09.508 --> 40:10.942
Life is too short.

40:12.711 --> 40:16.414
And we should be who we are.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.919

that we want to kiss.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.549
Of course. You're not gonna
go crazy on me, are you?

40:50.582 --> 40:53.485
-Probably.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.736
-This better be
the right place.
-It is.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.971
'Cause if this
isn't the right place,

41:13.004 --> 41:15.774
someone's about to be
real confused.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.077
(GASPS)

41:19.978 --> 41:21.880
-Barry?
-Hey.

41:21.913 --> 41:22.981
I knew it.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.282
I knew that was you.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.986
-I knew it was you in that
weird space portal thing!
-Yeah.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.255
I'm sorry. It took a
couple of tries to get here.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.857
This is my friend, Cisco.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.625
Well, friend is a loose term.
We work together.

41:33.659 --> 41:34.693
-Hi. Cisco.
-Hi.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.827
I have to say it,

41:35.861 --> 41:37.996
this is a nice universe
you got here.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.164
Thank you.

41:39.197 --> 41:42.000
Okay, do you remember last
year, when I helped you out

41:42.033 --> 41:44.570
and you promised to do
the same for me?

41:44.603 --> 41:45.771
What are we up against?
