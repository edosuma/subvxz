00:16.458 --> 00:18.693
The rebels elect a new leader!

00:18.760 --> 00:20.461
With their training complete,

00:20.528 --> 00:23.530
Obi-Wan and Anakin have left
Ahsoka on Onderon

00:23.598 --> 00:25.499
to monitor and advise the rebels

00:25.566 --> 00:28.034
as they continue to strike
Separatists targets

00:28.102 --> 00:31.371
under the command of Steela Gerrera.

00:31.439 --> 00:33.974
Facing an escalation of rebel attacks,

00:34.041 --> 00:35.842
the Separatists
have sent reinforcements

00:35.910 --> 00:38.446
to strengthen their hold
on the city of Iziz,

00:38.514 --> 00:42.249
as the battle for the planet unfolds.

00:43.652 --> 00:46.320
Oh, yummy, yummy.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.253 --> 01:17.354
Looks like more reinforcements.

01:17.422 --> 01:20.257
A small droid convoy leading
a multi-troop transport.

01:20.325 --> 01:22.158
An AAT bringing up the rear.

01:22.226 --> 01:23.726
Copy.

01:41.577 --> 01:42.544
Ah! It's an ambush!

01:42.612 --> 01:45.013
We need reinforcements.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.562
Ah, no!

02:21.884 --> 02:25.521
Do not be afraid,
brothers and sisters.

02:25.588 --> 02:27.856
We mean you no harm.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.497
It's time.

02:45.609 --> 02:47.977
People of Onderon,

02:48.045 --> 02:51.580
the time has come
to take back our freedom.

02:51.648 --> 02:54.016
We have all been deceived.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.017
King Rash is a traitor

02:56.085 --> 02:59.454
who has sold Onderon to
the Separatists for the crown.

02:59.522 --> 03:01.990
But Onderon is ours.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.960
We need your strength
to reclaim our planet

03:05.028 --> 03:08.598
and restore our sovereignty
under our true king,

03:08.665 --> 03:09.932
King Dendup.

03:19.009 --> 03:21.778
The terrorists
are no longer a nuisance

03:21.846 --> 03:24.648
but a threat to Onderon.

03:24.716 --> 03:28.085
It is only a matter of time
before they are all eliminated.

03:28.153 --> 03:31.423
How much longer before
they plunge us into chaos?

03:31.490 --> 03:33.959
It seems they're only
targeting the droid army.

03:34.027 --> 03:36.228
If you allowed
the royal Onderon militia

03:36.296 --> 03:37.897
to assume control of security,

03:37.965 --> 03:40.499
the terrorists may stop
and discuss terms.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.502
You will assume nothing,
General Tandin.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.971
With their coordinated attacks
and weapons,

03:46.039 --> 03:49.307
it is possible they're finding
sympathy within your own ranks.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.209
The threat is external,

03:51.277 --> 03:54.312
and your reinforcements
have done little to stop them.

03:54.380 --> 03:58.016
We will not negotiate with terrorists.

03:58.084 --> 03:59.384
They fear diplomacy.

03:59.451 --> 04:01.319
They embrace mayhem.

04:01.387 --> 04:02.420
What do we know about them?

04:08.628 --> 04:10.296
We've identified Steela Gerrera

04:10.364 --> 04:11.964
as the woman in the hologram.

04:12.032 --> 04:14.467
Her brother, Saw,
is also part of the group

04:14.535 --> 04:17.504
as well as the fugitive criminal
Lux Bonteri.

04:17.572 --> 04:20.574
The late senator Mina Bonteri's son?

04:20.642 --> 04:21.942
Yes, my lord.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.745
Why was I not told of this?

04:24.812 --> 04:26.413
You just were.

04:26.481 --> 04:28.482
Enough.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.951
It's clear that Dendup is behind this.

04:31.019 --> 04:33.454
We mustn't allow his followers
any momentum.

04:33.521 --> 04:35.522
Justice must come swiftly,

04:35.590 --> 04:36.757
without mercy.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.125
Bring him in.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.901
What now?

04:48.969 --> 04:53.105
Your supporters have begun
to publicly decry my reign.

04:53.173 --> 04:56.375
Am I still to believe you
are not behind their attacks?

04:56.443 --> 04:59.245
You must order them to surrender.

04:59.313 --> 05:01.280
Impossible.

05:01.348 --> 05:04.817
I have been isolated and alone
without visitors,

05:04.885 --> 05:07.019
confined to my prison.

05:07.087 --> 05:12.157
Again, the will of the people
is theirs, not mine.

05:14.426 --> 05:17.194
Well, then we shall see
what the will of the people

05:17.262 --> 05:18.896
is made of.

05:23.368 --> 05:26.137
Okay, guys, put it in the back
with the rest.

05:26.204 --> 05:28.339
Steela.

05:28.407 --> 05:31.243
They're executing King Dendup
tomorrow in Yolahn Square.

05:31.310 --> 05:32.244
Where did you hear this?

05:32.311 --> 05:33.245
Malgan Market.

05:33.312 --> 05:34.579
The merchants.

05:34.647 --> 05:37.483
The Separatists are saying
he's behind our attacks.

05:37.551 --> 05:40.119
More lies.

05:40.186 --> 05:44.056
They're making him an example
to humiliate us.

05:44.124 --> 05:47.092
Maybe, but their efforts
could work against them.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.828
Executing him would
only make him a martyr.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.463
We can't let him die.

05:51.531 --> 05:53.699
We have to break him out somehow.

05:53.767 --> 05:56.835
No, we should wait
until he's in public,

05:56.903 --> 05:58.203
at the execution.

05:58.271 --> 06:00.205
That's where they'd expect it.

06:00.273 --> 06:02.574
I know, but this is our moment.

06:02.642 --> 06:05.077
We'll save him
for all of Iziz to witness.

06:05.144 --> 06:06.678
We don't have much time.

06:06.746 --> 06:09.648
They're counting on us to show up.

06:09.715 --> 06:10.982
Where are you going?

06:11.050 --> 06:13.084
Trust me.

06:13.152 --> 06:14.118
Stop.

06:15.387 --> 06:16.888
Let me take care of this.

06:16.955 --> 06:19.190
This isn't about you.

06:19.258 --> 06:21.725
We can't afford
a reckless move right now.

06:21.793 --> 06:24.695
Yeah?
Go write a speech about it.

06:26.264 --> 06:28.632
You have to weigh the risk.

06:28.700 --> 06:31.168
That's why I'm going alone.

06:37.241 --> 06:38.708
Follow him.

06:48.398 --> 06:51.533
Steela.

06:51.601 --> 06:53.668
Saw is strong.

06:53.736 --> 06:55.203
He'll be fine.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.705
He's always been brash.

06:57.773 --> 06:59.173
Never thinks.

06:59.241 --> 07:03.879
He doesn't realize,
by leaving us, he's hurting us.

07:03.946 --> 07:06.781
We need a plan.

07:06.849 --> 07:09.083
They'd bring King Dendup
through the east entrance

07:09.151 --> 07:12.186
of Yolahn Square.

07:12.254 --> 07:14.889
Security will be tight.

07:14.957 --> 07:16.924
And rescuing him will...

07:16.992 --> 07:20.261
will not be easy.

07:20.328 --> 07:23.964
Lux, please don't
look at me like that.

07:24.032 --> 07:25.066
Forgive me.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.200
I'm sorry.
I...

07:26.268 --> 07:27.569
Listen.

07:27.636 --> 07:30.538
I just need to be alone right now.

07:30.605 --> 07:33.174
Gather everyone to go over the plan.

07:33.242 --> 07:35.143
Of course.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.158
I sense fear in you, Ahsoka.

07:51.226 --> 07:52.960
The rebels are divided.

07:53.028 --> 07:54.829
If they try to rescue the king now,

07:54.896 --> 07:56.897
I'm afraid we might lose them.

07:56.965 --> 07:58.966
We cannot control their fate.

07:59.034 --> 08:00.468
It's just,

08:00.536 --> 08:03.739
they're risking their lives
to save just one.

08:03.806 --> 08:06.041
Do not underestimate the king's power.

08:06.108 --> 08:07.476
He represents hope

08:07.544 --> 08:09.545
and is critical to their success.

08:14.617 --> 08:16.685
I feel responsible for them.

08:16.752 --> 08:18.019
I know you do, Snips,

08:18.087 --> 08:21.223
but remember, purpose
must come before feelings.

08:21.290 --> 08:23.191
I know, Master.

08:23.259 --> 08:26.195
Step in only if you must,
but remember,

08:26.262 --> 08:29.532
if this experiment is to become
an effective strategy,

08:29.600 --> 08:31.734
they must learn to survive
on their own.

08:31.801 --> 08:33.836
Yes, Master Kenobi.

08:33.903 --> 08:35.636
I understand.

09:38.504 --> 09:40.439
Uh, hey!

09:46.113 --> 09:48.548
My lord.

09:48.616 --> 09:50.283
Who are you?

09:50.351 --> 09:51.918
I'm Saw Gerrera.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.820
What do you want?

09:53.887 --> 09:55.254
You freedom, sire.

09:55.322 --> 09:56.789
You're to be executed tomorrow,

09:56.857 --> 09:58.257
but I'm getting you out of here.

09:58.325 --> 10:01.560
The people of Onderon need your help.

10:01.627 --> 10:04.229
Stand up.

10:04.297 --> 10:07.399
Are you one of the meddlers
creating disorder,

10:07.467 --> 10:09.902
interfering in the affairs
of the throne?

10:09.970 --> 10:14.339
Only to restore your kingship
as the rightful ruler.

10:14.407 --> 10:16.140
I see.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.310
This was all my doing.

10:19.378 --> 10:21.412
I opened the door.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.315
That's why the Separatists are here.

10:24.383 --> 10:27.351
I was faced with a difficult choice:

10:27.419 --> 10:30.420
to join the Republic
or the Confederacy.

10:30.488 --> 10:31.955
Both are corrupt,

10:32.023 --> 10:36.860
but I had to pick a side
before one was chosen for me,

10:36.928 --> 10:39.596
except I chose neither.

10:39.664 --> 10:42.666
Now is the time to take back Onderon.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.200
Our movement is gaining momentum.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.669
It has the backing of the Jedi.

10:46.737 --> 10:48.572
Jedi?

10:48.639 --> 10:50.140
Yes, sire.

10:50.208 --> 10:54.011
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

10:54.079 --> 10:56.013
Follow me, sire.

10:56.081 --> 10:58.182
Onderon awaits.

11:00.151 --> 11:01.719
Oneway shield.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.373
Do any of you have questions?

11:24.441 --> 11:26.075
It's a risky plan,

11:26.142 --> 11:27.876
but it's our best shot.

11:27.944 --> 11:30.246
Ahsoka, will you join us?

11:30.313 --> 11:31.581
I can't.

11:31.648 --> 11:34.483
I've already been more involved
than the Council wanted.

11:34.551 --> 11:38.187
I'm afraid I've been instructed
to sit this one out.

11:39.590 --> 11:40.824
They have Saw.

11:40.891 --> 11:43.560
He's alive, but I watched them
take him away.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.398
We have to save him.

11:55.073 --> 11:57.408
No.

11:57.475 --> 11:59.910
We have to save King Dendup.

11:59.978 --> 12:03.147
We don't have time
or the bodies to do both.

12:03.214 --> 12:04.548
He's your brother.

12:04.616 --> 12:07.785
That's what Saw would want,
what he would expect.

12:07.853 --> 12:11.589
And I expect the same
from everyone in this room.

12:11.657 --> 12:15.760
I know it's a hard choice,
but I agree.

12:15.828 --> 12:18.863
Purpose must come before feelings.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.848
Where are the other terrorists?

12:36.916 --> 12:41.353
Onderon is our system, not yours.

12:50.696 --> 12:52.364
Enough.

12:55.434 --> 12:57.202
We have to keep him alive.

12:57.269 --> 12:59.504
He is a direct link to the terrorists.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.072
You pity him.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.608
I pity your ignorance.

13:03.676 --> 13:06.578
You can control the people of Onderon,

13:06.646 --> 13:09.748
but you won't sustain it
against their will.

13:09.815 --> 13:12.684
What you're doing guarantees
others will take his place.

13:12.752 --> 13:15.520
They, too, will suffer.

13:15.588 --> 13:18.857
Then the war is lost.

13:18.925 --> 13:21.193
You have strong tactics,
but it's unfortunate

13:21.260 --> 13:24.629
you cannot calculate
a different approach.

13:37.428 --> 13:39.062
Here, drink.

13:39.130 --> 13:40.897
It will give you strength.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.935
The Separatists have
very little compassion

13:45.003 --> 13:48.405
or patience for things
that stand in their way.

13:48.473 --> 13:49.773
Hmm.

13:49.841 --> 13:52.376
We have a duty
to protect what's ours, General,

13:52.444 --> 13:54.912
a duty once entrusted to you.

13:54.979 --> 13:58.148
I thought you depleted
your arrogance with Kalani.

13:58.216 --> 14:01.685
It replenishes every hour.

14:03.654 --> 14:06.389
King Rash is the crowned head
of Onderon.

14:06.457 --> 14:08.024
What's yours is his,

14:08.092 --> 14:09.892
and he will do with it as he pleases.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.261
Dendup is the true king.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.897
Are you following his orders?

14:14.965 --> 14:17.266
We take orders from no one.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.101
Aligning yourself with the past

14:19.168 --> 14:21.303
does not bode well for your future.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.104
We share the same future.

14:23.172 --> 14:26.975
We can sit here as free men
or servants of the Separatists.

14:27.043 --> 14:28.677
I am free,

14:28.745 --> 14:31.213
while you have chosen
to become a terrorist.

14:31.281 --> 14:33.882
I'm not a terrorist.
I'm a patriot.

14:33.950 --> 14:36.551
And resistance is not terrorism.

14:38.154 --> 14:40.388
King Dendup chose his people

14:40.456 --> 14:44.059
instead of taking a side
in the intergalactic war.

14:44.127 --> 14:48.497
Separatists have taken over
Onderon because we let them.

15:20.697 --> 15:22.798
As your king,

15:22.866 --> 15:26.102
I present to you Ramsis Dendup

15:26.169 --> 15:28.371
not as a former king

15:28.439 --> 15:30.239
but as a criminal

15:30.307 --> 15:34.644
sponsoring terrorist acts
against the people of Onderon.

15:34.712 --> 15:36.579
But fear not, good citizens.

15:36.647 --> 15:39.783
As your leader and protector,

15:39.850 --> 15:43.253
I will see that you are safe
from such villainy.

15:43.321 --> 15:45.589
He has betrayed you,

15:45.656 --> 15:49.293
and today he will pay
for those treasonous deeds

15:49.360 --> 15:51.795
with his life.

15:53.665 --> 15:56.867
Your people will see you
into the next world.

15:56.935 --> 15:59.303
May you find forgiveness there.

16:17.787 --> 16:20.088
Time to die.

16:28.731 --> 16:30.799
Wait for my signal.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.935
Ready weapons.

16:38.041 --> 16:39.909
Not yet.

16:41.312 --> 16:43.112
Now!

16:54.057 --> 16:56.092
Come on.
Go, go, go!

16:57.961 --> 16:58.894
Come with us.

16:58.962 --> 16:59.895
Blast 'em!

17:16.079 --> 17:18.214
Follow me.

17:19.849 --> 17:20.816
This way.

17:20.884 --> 17:22.018
Come on.
Let's go.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.268
Surrender now or die.

17:43.007 --> 17:44.173
It's over.

17:44.241 --> 17:46.509
Do as they say.

17:52.416 --> 17:55.285
Calm yourselves.
The threat is over.

17:55.352 --> 17:57.387
See for yourselves as these traitors

17:57.455 --> 18:00.157
all endure the same punishment.

18:04.196 --> 18:06.597
Good try, sis.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.914
Ready weapons.

18:26.553 --> 18:27.820
They're innocent!

18:27.888 --> 18:28.988
Let them go.

18:29.055 --> 18:31.791
The snake will not strike again.

18:31.859 --> 18:33.159
Stop.

18:33.227 --> 18:34.994
What?

18:35.062 --> 18:37.296
The only snake I see, sire,

18:37.364 --> 18:39.198
is you.

18:49.442 --> 18:50.743
Traitor.

18:50.810 --> 18:52.010
I was.

18:52.078 --> 18:54.179
Not anymore.

18:59.652 --> 19:01.219
What are you doing, General?

19:05.291 --> 19:08.026
Go.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.505
Let them through.

19:19.573 --> 19:20.540
Make way.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.008
Everyone go with them.

19:22.075 --> 19:23.009
But, sir...

19:23.076 --> 19:24.844
Go.

19:29.149 --> 19:31.617
Huh.
What now, General?

19:31.685 --> 19:35.054
As soon as you release me,
you'll be shot dead.

19:43.498 --> 19:44.898
Jedi?

19:44.966 --> 19:47.601
General, follow me.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.674
After them.
Kill them.

19:53.742 --> 19:54.742
Kill them!

19:54.809 --> 19:55.876
Dendup is the true king!

19:55.944 --> 19:57.311
We want the Separatists gone.

19:57.379 --> 19:58.779
Save Dendup!

20:14.764 --> 20:16.866
Why now?

20:16.933 --> 20:19.902
It was time
for a new approach, my lord.

20:21.204 --> 20:23.706
Do I have your loyalty?

20:23.774 --> 20:26.108
And that of the army.

20:26.176 --> 20:27.944
You also have ours.

20:28.011 --> 20:30.613
With your rule, our numbers will grow.

20:30.681 --> 20:34.216
Thanks, child.

20:34.284 --> 20:36.318
Your mother would be proud.

20:36.386 --> 20:37.887
Thank you, my lord.

20:37.955 --> 20:41.257
We must first win the will
of the people.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.126
That is the only way.

20:44.194 --> 20:47.329
The Separatists will assemble
their forces.

20:47.396 --> 20:52.233
Count Dooku will want me dead
more than ever.

20:52.301 --> 20:55.169
Then we'll have to teach them
another lesson.

20:55.237 --> 20:56.404
Together.

21:01.209 --> 21:04.311
Ahsoka, I knew you couldn't
resist a good fight.

21:04.379 --> 21:07.048
Am I becoming that predictable?

21:07.116 --> 21:09.384
Only to me.

21:12.321 --> 21:15.857
The Separatists definitely
know we're backing the rebels.

21:15.924 --> 21:17.659
Then prepare yourself.

21:17.726 --> 21:20.295
The real fight is about to begin.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.531
Will you be able to send some help?

21:22.598 --> 21:25.300
That's up to the Council, Ahsoka.
