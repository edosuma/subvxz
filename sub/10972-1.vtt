05:58.449 --> 05:59.734
Let's go, buster.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.651
Beer.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.320
And a bottle.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.698
Ain't much good.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.535
It's all there is.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.635
Will you want anything else?

07:49.719 --> 07:52.179
Just a peaceful hour to drink it in.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.830
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in Lago.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.425
Life here's a little too quick for them.

08:34.431 --> 08:38.142
Maybe you think you're fast enough
to keep up with us, huh?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.379
A lot faster than you'll ever live to be.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.905
Yes, sir?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.366
Shave and a hot bath?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.243
That'll be 90 cents.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.641
Cash.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.979
Well, what I mean to say is that
the 90 cents usually comes first.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.189
But, hell, it don't really matter.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.692
Before or after, what's the diff?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.695
Sir.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.212
<i>Eau de</i> lilac's only 10 cents more.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.840
Lilac water. Oh, the ladies love it.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.759
Shall we make it an even dollar? No.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.891
Yes.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.576
Moses.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.677
Right you are, gentlemen.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.347
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.103
What, you don't like our company?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.275
What's the matter with you?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.322
I'm speaking to you, pig shit.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.034
I think he's got some of that
pig shit in his ear.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.996
I don't know which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.911
What did you say your name was again?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.581
I didn't.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.044
No. I guess you didn't at that, did you?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.379
Why don't you watch where you're going?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.548
Look at this. It's ruined.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.675
There's no need for all that.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
All what?

14:05.553 --> 14:09.097
If you want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.517
Acquainted?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.770
Why, you'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.316
Just a minute.
I'm not finished with you yet.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.070
You know, at a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.

14:23.154 --> 14:26.865
But you're certainly a disappointment
up close, aren't you?

14:33.831 --> 14:37.417
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big as your mouth.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.596
You know what you are?

14:41.631 --> 14:42.756
Just trash.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.677
A bottle of whiskey for courage
and the manners of a goat.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.766
You're the one who could use
a lesson in manners.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.977
Not from you, whiskey breath.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.645
Let go of me!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.647
Let go!

15:03.945 --> 15:05.404
Let go of me!

15:06.531 --> 15:09.449
Let go of me, you! Put me down!

15:10.326 --> 15:11.493
Help me!

15:15.164 --> 15:16.957
What are you doing?

15:35.852 --> 15:38.562
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.023
My horse.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.151
A room.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.245
Would you like to register, please, sir?

20:41.073 --> 20:44.409
Somebody, please help me.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.761
Damn you all to hell.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.580
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- Yeah.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.083
Say, are you planning to stay,

22:15.167 --> 22:16.918
keep your room another night?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.547
I'll let you know.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.215
All right, anything you say.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.078
Morning.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.900
I've still got a bath coming.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.527
Nice hot bath coming right up.
Yes, sir.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.323
Mordecai, you put some more hot water
in that tub there.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.492
This gentleman wants a bath.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.579
You can hang your clothes
right down there on the peg.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.290
Now, Miss Peekins does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.625
Right this way, Captain, sir.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.460
Unless you want Mordecai
to take them out

23:40.544 --> 23:41.961
and get them laundered
while you're soaking.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.756
Miss Peekins does a right clean boiled wash.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.468
Uses lye for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.646
Well, pour the water, Mordecai,
before it gets cold.

24:00.231 --> 24:03.024
We want the gentleman to be comfortable.

24:19.917 --> 24:24.170
Well, I've been wanting to talk to you.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.010
I might as well get this stool here

24:31.095 --> 24:33.388
and set right down and do it, right?

24:35.683 --> 24:38.143
If that's all right with you, huh?

24:48.070 --> 24:50.780
Well, what's it about is Billy Borders.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.534
Don't know the man.

24:55.578 --> 24:59.581
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.

24:59.665 --> 25:03.334
Him and Ike Sharp and Fred Morris.

25:07.256 --> 25:11.092
You know, those are just the names,
in case you're interested.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.304
Well, I'm not really interested, Sheriff.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.973
Well, I can't say I blame you, you know.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.601
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.227
And he didn't have much personality.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.522
What he did have was all bad, just bad.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.403
What you're trying to say is
there's no charge, right?

25:32.281 --> 25:35.366
Well, forgive and forget, you know.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.119
That's our motto.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.418
You dirty bastard!

25:47.046 --> 25:48.338
I'll kill you!

25:49.256 --> 25:51.174
Damn it, Callie!

25:56.889 --> 25:58.264
Callie, damn it!

25:58.515 --> 26:00.808
Let go of me, you fat lug!

26:00.893 --> 26:01.843
Stop...

26:02.978 --> 26:04.896
Tell him I'd appreciate it

26:04.980 --> 26:08.650
if he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.153
Goddamn it!

26:12.238 --> 26:13.404
I'll kill you!

26:20.246 --> 26:23.122
I wonder what took her so long to get mad.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.668
Because maybe you didn't go back for more.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.047
It don't seem to me
that we got a choice.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.841
Seeing we got no time
to send for help,

26:34.051 --> 26:35.969
and further seeing that our sheriff's

26:36.053 --> 26:38.554
about as much use
as tits on a boar.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.307
Sorry I'm late. Anything happen?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.434
No, no, His Honor's had the floor.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.644
In case you haven't heard it yet,

26:44.728 --> 26:48.106
Stacey Bridges and the Carlin brothers
are due to get out of jail today.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.440
They coming here?

26:49.525 --> 26:51.317
That's been their plan,
according to all reports.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.111
There's no reason to believe
they've changed it.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.530
Possibly they've repented their ways.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.741
Preacher, they're gonna burn this town
to the ground and you know it.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.744
What we're talking about now
is a way to stop them.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.622
We gotta find that way now and quick.

27:04.873 --> 27:07.583
Nevertheless, my conscience will not
allow me to be a party

27:07.668 --> 27:09.669
to the hiring of a professional gunfighter.

27:09.753 --> 27:14.048
Well, maybe you'd like to go out there
and stand them off yourself, Preacher.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.967
I'm just a simple man of God.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.761
Well, it's time we unsimplified you, Reverend.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.180
Now, Borders, Morris and Short
were professional gunfighters

27:21.265 --> 27:23.141
on the payroll of the Lago Mining Company

27:23.225 --> 27:26.144
to protect our interests
and the interests of this town,

27:26.228 --> 27:27.478
which are identical.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.732
They stood around drinking beer
and looking snotty for a full year.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.525
And then one day before
we actually needed the bastards,

27:32.609 --> 27:34.777
they managed to get themselves killed.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.029
So if you've got a suggestion,

27:36.113 --> 27:37.488
we'd be delighted to hear it.

27:37.573 --> 27:42.368
Otherwise, take your conscience elsewhere
while we think about saving your ass.

27:42.619 --> 27:46.164
Land's sakes. Where's time gone to, huh?

27:46.415 --> 27:49.959
Miss Peekins' eldest is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...

27:51.337 --> 27:53.504
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

27:59.595 --> 28:03.139
Well, we were talking
about hiring a gunfighter.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.099
Yeah, we don't know anything
about that fellow there.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.768
Well, we know he took the best
we could find to hire,

28:06.852 --> 28:08.311
like Grant took Vicksburg.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.605
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.

28:11.106 --> 28:14.692
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.

28:14.777 --> 28:17.278
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.697
I still say we're asking for trouble!

28:20.699 --> 28:22.200
A fellow like that,
what do we know about him?

28:22.284 --> 28:23.368
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.495
Well, you've got our permission
to go and ask him.

28:27.748 --> 28:31.459
Although, the last three that tried that
didn't fare all that well.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.169
Let me out!

28:33.253 --> 28:37.507
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!

28:37.591 --> 28:40.343
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!

28:40.427 --> 28:41.636
You fat pig!

28:41.720 --> 28:44.305
Hey, come here.
What is this?

28:45.265 --> 28:47.392
I was just down there
sounding out that stranger,

28:47.476 --> 28:49.394
when she come in there blasting away
like a Cheyenne!

28:49.478 --> 28:51.020
All right, Sam. All right.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.564
You're planning to let him get away
with this, aren't you?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.608
- Be a little patient, will you?
- Patient?

28:55.692 --> 28:58.236
Callie, when you run across a man
who's used to having his own way,

28:58.320 --> 29:01.155
you let him have it
until he goes too far.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.617
Just what do you consider
going too far?

29:04.701 --> 29:08.413
I mean, isn't forcible rape in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?

29:08.497 --> 29:11.165
There's too much at stake
to throw away on hysterics now.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.959
Hysterics?

29:14.294 --> 29:17.964
Well, I can remember some hysterics one night
not too long ago.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.674
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

29:21.593 --> 29:23.386
Morgan, get her out of here.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.847
I'll see you later.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.598
Yeah.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.560
Not while that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch

29:30.644 --> 29:32.812
is still breathing, you won't!

29:33.188 --> 29:36.524
You wonder if there's a man
left in this town!

29:36.817 --> 29:41.320
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

29:45.868 --> 29:47.076
Well...

29:49.037 --> 29:50.288
Why not?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.625
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

29:54.710 --> 29:59.255
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...

30:00.299 --> 30:03.176
Besides, I have nothing
against these men.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.511
Who did you say they are?

30:06.472 --> 30:09.432
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins,
the Carlin boys,

30:09.516 --> 30:11.642
they worked for the company. They...

30:11.727 --> 30:14.437
You know, what you call troubleshooters.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.524
You know, just like those three
you done in yesterday,

30:18.609 --> 30:21.319
except when they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.653
And they took care of it, too.

30:22.738 --> 30:26.449
Except, well, they got too damn big
for their britches.

30:26.533 --> 30:30.912
Started pushing people around,
and taking over the town and we had to...

30:31.246 --> 30:32.622
Had to what?

30:34.625 --> 30:37.793
Well, we had to take them into custody,
that's what.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.672
Yeah. I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.271
Hey, you won't be wanting that slab of pie,
will you?

31:03.278 --> 31:05.404
You know what happened, friend,

31:05.489 --> 31:09.200
is they stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office down there,

31:09.284 --> 31:11.369
and they hid it under the floorboard

31:11.453 --> 31:13.538
of the shack that they lived in.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.207
Kind of careless of them, wasn't it?

31:16.708 --> 31:20.461
I mean, does a mining company usually
leave gold ingots lying around like that?

31:20.546 --> 31:22.713
Well, it does seem a bit peculiar, you know.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.591
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing that up
at the trial all the time,

31:25.676 --> 31:28.469
saying that he was being railroaded with.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.180
And do you know that's why
they're mad at us?

31:31.306 --> 31:34.141
- No, I'll tell you what you can do, Sheriff.
- What?

31:34.226 --> 31:36.727
When those boys come back to town,

31:36.812 --> 31:39.230
you just clap the bracelets
right on them.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.065
- Me?
- Yeah.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.109
Well, I might have forgot to mention

31:43.193 --> 31:46.779
that they were all three passed out
at the time, you know?

31:47.656 --> 31:49.448
Look, I'm no lawman.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.701
You know, they just hung this thing on me

31:51.785 --> 31:54.203
when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.747
You know, he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.709
Bullwhipped. Damndest thing I ever saw.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.671
Now, why would anybody
want to do a thing like that?

32:03.755 --> 32:07.633
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody from this town, anyhow.

32:07.718 --> 32:08.843
How do you know?

32:08.927 --> 32:12.096
Well, this is a good town,
and these are good people.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.640
And look, friend,
we sure would like it

32:14.725 --> 32:16.684
if you'd help us with our problem.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.689
Only problem you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.108
You people don't need me.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.235
Look.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.404
Place a couple of good riflemen

32:28.488 --> 32:30.531
on top of that building up there.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.742
Maybe a couple more with shotguns

32:32.826 --> 32:34.452
down behind grain bags over there.

32:34.536 --> 32:37.622
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there in the bell tower.

32:37.706 --> 32:40.249
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just about take care of it.

32:40.334 --> 32:43.878
Well, what would it take
to see that through, you know?

32:44.171 --> 32:46.631
The ambush. What would it cost us?

32:46.840 --> 32:50.051
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like this town that much.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.971
Well, this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.058
You like them, you save them.

32:59.186 --> 33:02.271
Look, what if we offered you
anything you want?

33:08.570 --> 33:09.862
Anything?

33:10.572 --> 33:13.074
Unlimited credit. That's what it means.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.577
An open charge account with no reckoning.

33:16.787 --> 33:19.747
What His Honor's trying to say is

33:20.040 --> 33:23.250
you got yourself a free hand
in this town, friend.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.002
Any damn thing I want, huh?

33:25.087 --> 33:26.629
Yeah. Go on. Help yourself.

33:26.713 --> 33:29.423
Help yourself! Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.592
Yes, sir.
Anything you want that's here,

33:31.677 --> 33:33.969
as best as we can
get it for you, we will.

33:34.054 --> 33:37.973
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex

33:38.058 --> 33:40.434
and keep your bed warm at night.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.228
Hey, you!

33:42.312 --> 33:44.855
Keep your sticky fingers off them blankets
if you're not buying.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.983
And keep them kids under control.
Goddamn savages.

33:48.068 --> 33:51.237
And besides, you know,
about handling that ambush,

33:51.321 --> 33:55.074
you know, everybody in town,
more or less, is at your orders.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.428
Here you go.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.473
No, no. No.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.309
Tell him it's all right.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.687
It's all right.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.354
Anything I want?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.447
Now, how's that feel?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.658
Not bad. I'll take them.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.828
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

35:22.913 --> 35:25.539
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.126
Let's see, that'll be,
five and two, carry the nine,

35:29.878 --> 35:32.213
and that comes to exactly...

35:32.297 --> 35:33.547
No charge.

35:47.729 --> 35:50.397
Come on, now.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.320
I'd like to get all these people a drink.

36:38.405 --> 36:42.324
Yes, sir. One round for the house.
There you are.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.662
This gentleman here's buying
a round for the house.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.707
No fair. No fair. I ordered one, too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?

36:49.791 --> 36:52.835
You get a glass of beer, right there.
Coming up.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.174
There we are.

36:59.259 --> 37:03.888
Now, that's one round for the house, sir.
Anything else?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.222
Get yourself something.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.642
Oh, thank you very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.563
And smoke it later.

37:13.607 --> 37:18.694
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.363
There's no charge, Lutie.

37:23.116 --> 37:26.660
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants in this town, he gets.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.912
You voted on it.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.289
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.834
Well, everybody's got to put something
in the kitty, right?

37:36.588 --> 37:37.796
Right.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.763
About time this town had a new sheriff.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.936
I'm the sheriff? I'm the sheriff.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.522
I'm sorry, Sam.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.901
But you looked so comical
when he put your badge on the runt.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.820
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.

38:03.406 --> 38:04.865
And the mayor.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.450
And I'm the mayor.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.118
Any objections?

38:08.203 --> 38:09.703
No. No, that's fine.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.542
I'm the mayor. I'm the sheriff.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.755
No more, "Mordecai, bring the water.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.967
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."

38:23.051 --> 38:26.261
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.722
Hot damn!

38:29.140 --> 38:30.641
Wait a minute.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.020
I can't be a sheriff
if I don't have a gun.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.025
Is this about the size gun
you're looking for?

38:40.110 --> 38:42.152
No, that one. That'll do.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.163
Whatever this gent wants,
he's to have.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.916
That's orders of Mr. Drake and Mr. Allen.

38:56.292 --> 39:00.045
I want every man in the regiment
to have one of these nice rifles.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.672
What regiment?

39:04.259 --> 39:06.844
The City of Lago Volunteers.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.429
Never heard of them.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.431
Why, you ought to, you're in it.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.517
So are you, you,
and all of you out there.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.895
I want you all out in the street
in 10 minutes for drill.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.122
Well, that's that.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.972
Bridges, you Carlin boys,

39:53.141 --> 39:56.643
don't forget your tickets back here
to my little hotel.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.313
And don't worry. They ain't loaded.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.192
What about our horses?

40:04.986 --> 40:07.029
We had three good animals.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.657
What do you think you've been eating
the last six months?

40:16.164 --> 40:19.249
Damn him! Dog, I didn't eat my own horse!

40:20.418 --> 40:21.960
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.587
He just stole them
and sold them to somebody.

40:23.671 --> 40:24.713
- That's what he done!
- Shut up.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.257
- Well, that's what he done!
- Shut up.

40:27.509 --> 40:30.844
When we get to Lago,
you can have the mayor's horse.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.888
Fried or barbecued.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.683
Well, I guess we walk some.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.895
Old Drake and Allen
don't seem to have remembered.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.731
Oh, they'll remember.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.318
One way or another, they'll remember.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.959
All right.

41:02.836 --> 41:05.045
You don't wanna get shot.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.882
You don't want your shops
or your houses burned.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.343
You don't want your women touched.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.054
You don't want anything to happen.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.891
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.854
Or you don't know how.

42:55.448 --> 42:56.865
Shit.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.468
Fire! Fire!

43:22.308 --> 43:23.809
Come on, fire!

43:51.045 --> 43:52.713
I don't remember lending my wagons

43:52.797 --> 43:55.799
to be shot up
by these goddamn fools out here.

43:59.387 --> 44:00.929
You know, you're gonna look awfully silly

44:01.014 --> 44:03.307
with that knife sticking up your ass.

44:08.438 --> 44:11.690
Fire! Pull those triggers!
Come on, shoot!

44:12.317 --> 44:13.317
Shoot!

44:13.651 --> 44:15.193
Aim! Fire!

44:22.243 --> 44:23.452
You still here?

44:24.662 --> 44:27.873
No. No, I was... I was just going.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.347
Damn! Can you do that every time?

44:43.431 --> 44:44.931
Damn right he can.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.726
We're not gonna have a thing
in the world to worry about.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.936
This is gonna be a picnic!

44:50.271 --> 44:52.689
All right, keep them after us, huh?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.484
Go on, out there.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.290
You men carpenters?

45:10.792 --> 45:13.001
<i>Sí, señor.</i> We do rough fixing.

45:13.461 --> 45:14.920
Could you make some tables, big ones,

45:15.004 --> 45:16.630
that a lot of people could sit?

45:16.714 --> 45:17.923
Like for a church picnic?

45:18.007 --> 45:19.049
Exactly.

45:20.676 --> 45:24.471
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.557
Could you have them ready for me
by tomorrow morning?

45:27.642 --> 45:28.725
If we have the lumber.

45:28.810 --> 45:29.810
You'll have the lumber.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.478
Come on with me.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.356
You really planning a picnic?

45:34.440 --> 45:35.649
Any objection?

45:35.900 --> 45:38.193
No, just it's the damndest thing
I ever heard of.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.237
- You haven't heard the funny part.
- What's that?

45:40.321 --> 45:41.738
You're furnishing the beer and whiskey.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.209
Oh, Preacher.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.419
Good morning, Brother Belding.

45:55.503 --> 45:57.254
Mrs. Lake was just asking about you.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.922
Oh, how is the dear old soul?

45:59.006 --> 46:00.465
Oh, she's chipper as a jaybird.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.591
I don't know how she does it.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.885
Well, she's got the strength of her faith,
Brother Belding.

46:03.970 --> 46:06.012
Praise God. The strength of her faith.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.515
Too bad about your barn. Termites?

46:08.724 --> 46:11.977
There's nothing wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.230
Then how come those two Mexs
is tearing it down?

46:15.314 --> 46:16.440
What?

46:27.493 --> 46:31.288
What do you greasy bastards think
you're doing to my barn?

46:31.372 --> 46:32.998
Exactly what I told them.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.834
We're requisitioning your barn, Belding.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.004
Any objection?

46:42.717 --> 46:44.843
You men can go back to work.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.140
Would you mind telling me
what the hell's going on here?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.142
And you can help out, too.

46:53.728 --> 46:56.813
You mean, you want me to help you
tear down my barn?

46:58.524 --> 47:00.025
Wait a minute.

47:00.526 --> 47:01.818
Maybe he'd be better use

47:01.903 --> 47:04.779
if he'd help us collect the few little items
we're still missing.

47:04.864 --> 47:07.324
Items? What items? What for?

47:07.408 --> 47:09.951
You got the list, Sheriff.
Read it to him.

47:12.497 --> 47:15.415
We still need 35 bedsheets,

47:15.500 --> 47:19.628
one barbecued steer
and 200 gallons of red paint.

47:21.464 --> 47:23.048
Red paint?

47:23.132 --> 47:25.926
We're counting on you for the bedsheets.

47:27.595 --> 47:28.720
Is there anything else?

47:28.804 --> 47:29.888
Yes, there is.

47:29.972 --> 47:33.558
How long is it gonna take you
to get everybody out of your hotel?

47:35.228 --> 47:36.311
What?

47:36.395 --> 47:38.855
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?

47:40.107 --> 47:42.025
Why, I just can't...

47:42.109 --> 47:44.945
I mean, I got eight people
living in rooms up there in my hotel.

47:45.029 --> 47:47.656
Now, I just...
Where are they gonna go?

47:49.200 --> 47:50.283
Out.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.718
You know better than to walk
in a man's camp and...

48:11.347 --> 48:13.390
What the hell is going on?

49:03.024 --> 49:06.443
Well, Stacey, looks like
we got three fresh horses.

49:07.278 --> 49:08.820
Wait a while.

49:11.324 --> 49:13.575
He's got him some snappy duds.

49:38.851 --> 49:39.976
Faster!

49:43.939 --> 49:45.899
Fire! Pull that trigger!

49:49.528 --> 49:50.528
Go on!

49:55.660 --> 49:56.660
Go on!

49:59.747 --> 50:00.830
Shoot!

50:07.338 --> 50:08.963
Pull that trigger!

50:09.048 --> 50:10.048
Fire!

50:11.884 --> 50:13.009
Any improvement?

50:13.294 --> 50:14.344
Some.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.346
You know, Lew and I were thinking,

50:16.430 --> 50:18.598
maybe we were a little hasty in our decision.

50:18.683 --> 50:19.933
What do you mean?

50:20.017 --> 50:22.894
Well, maybe we don't need any outside help
to solve our problem.

50:22.978 --> 50:25.021
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.231
Every man who ever got sent up,

50:26.315 --> 50:28.525
went away saying he's gonna come back
and get even, right?

50:28.609 --> 50:29.693
But think about it.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.319
Can you actually remember anyone ever

50:31.404 --> 50:32.862
coming back and doing anything?

50:32.947 --> 50:34.239
I can't think of one. Can you?

50:34.323 --> 50:37.033
The point being, you want to get rid
of the gunfighter. Is that it?

50:37.118 --> 50:39.327
Now, Dave, we got to
before it's too late.

50:39.412 --> 50:41.579
He's making a mock of this whole town.

50:41.664 --> 50:44.165
Making that little dwarf the sheriff.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.834
Kicking my own people
out of my own hotel.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.128
Got half of the women in town
sewing bedsheets together.

50:48.212 --> 50:49.212
They're my bedsheets!

50:49.296 --> 50:51.589
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.

50:51.674 --> 50:53.717
Lutie Naylor, down there
barbecuing a whole damn steer.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.635
Some kind of a picnic.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.595
Right here in our own town.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.055
Sounds pretty good to me.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.432
What do you mean?

51:00.516 --> 51:02.142
I mean, it sounds like a good idea,

51:02.226 --> 51:04.519
bringing everything out in the open
so we can see it.

51:04.603 --> 51:05.562
Don't you see what we're saying?

51:05.646 --> 51:06.813
This whole thing's all for nothing.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.106
They're probably all three blind drunk

51:08.190 --> 51:09.566
in some Nogales whorehouse right now.

51:09.650 --> 51:12.277
Well, if they're dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.779
Surely we can put up with the man
for one more day.

51:14.864 --> 51:16.406
No. I say no.

51:16.490 --> 51:20.744
He's got this whole town so people
are beginning to turn on each other.

51:21.162 --> 51:25.081
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?

51:28.127 --> 51:29.461
You want to spell that out, Drake?

51:29.545 --> 51:30.545
Spell it yourself.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.464
I'm not gonna jeopardize everything
I've built here

51:32.548 --> 51:34.549
because some blond bitch and he
threw you out of bed.

51:34.633 --> 51:35.925
God damn you!
Don't talk to me that way.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.093
I'll talk to you any way I like!

51:37.178 --> 51:38.595
I'll say anything I have to say

51:38.679 --> 51:39.804
as long as I'm running this company.

51:39.889 --> 51:40.889
Well, say it, but you could listen

51:40.973 --> 51:42.182
once in a while yourself, you know.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.266
What's the matter, Morgan?

51:43.350 --> 51:45.101
You're not getting your fair share
of the profits?

51:45.186 --> 51:47.103
Profits. It's not the profits.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.230
It's just that this whole business
has gone sour

51:49.315 --> 51:52.025
since that deal with that former Marshal Duncan.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.903
Wait a minute, we had no choice in that matter,
and you know it.

51:54.987 --> 51:56.112
- Come on!
- Wait a minute...

51:56.197 --> 51:58.782
The big mistake we made was hiring
that man Duncan in the first place,

51:58.908 --> 52:00.784
- and you did that all by yourself.
- All by myself?

52:00.910 --> 52:04.662
- Quiet. Shut up. We can trust one another.
- Guys, please...

52:06.332 --> 52:09.793
This whole town had a hand
in what happened.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.881
Hell, why do you think Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers

52:14.965 --> 52:17.592
kept their mouths shut all this time?

52:17.885 --> 52:20.303
Same reason everybody else
did in this town.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.931
One hang, we all hang.

52:25.226 --> 52:28.978
Now, you just grit your teeth
a little bit longer.

52:29.063 --> 52:32.482
The gunfighter stays till I say otherwise.
You understand?

52:41.033 --> 52:42.534
Well, there it is, just like he said.

52:42.618 --> 52:44.869
That stranger's got everybody
turning on everybody.

52:46.288 --> 52:48.706
Being put out after all these years.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.501
That man!

52:51.585 --> 52:52.752
Right here.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.672
Okay, folks, put your bags
right here in the wagon.

52:55.756 --> 52:57.340
All right, folks, just put your bags

52:57.424 --> 52:59.634
right here in the wagon.
Right here.

52:59.718 --> 53:01.094
What's going on here?

53:01.178 --> 53:03.221
What the hell does it look like
is going on, Preacher?

53:03.305 --> 53:05.181
They're emptying my whole hotel.

53:05.266 --> 53:07.517
Throwing out paying guests,
right into the street

53:07.601 --> 53:10.854
just to make room
for our new guardian angel.

53:11.856 --> 53:14.482
He likes to be by himself,
more or less.

53:15.484 --> 53:18.319
You see who's running our town now?

53:19.446 --> 53:22.323
He's sitting right over there, Mr. Belding.

53:22.408 --> 53:23.616
If you don't like it

53:23.701 --> 53:26.035
why don't you just go over there
and tell him that he can't?

53:26.954 --> 53:28.246
Mordecai,

53:30.624 --> 53:34.168
someday soon someone's going to step
on your scrawny little neck, you lizard,

53:34.253 --> 53:36.379
and when they do, you're going to be nothing
but a squished monster.

53:36.463 --> 53:37.964
See here,

53:38.048 --> 53:40.216
you can't turn all these people out
into the night.

53:40.301 --> 53:42.844
It is inhuman, brother. Inhuman!

53:46.807 --> 53:48.558
I'm not your brother.

53:48.642 --> 53:51.394
We are all brothers in the eyes of God.

53:54.481 --> 53:57.817
All these people,
are they your sisters and brothers?

53:58.652 --> 54:00.486
They most certainly are.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.573
Then you won't mind
if they come over

54:03.657 --> 54:05.325
and stay at your place, will you?

54:13.542 --> 54:16.920
All right, folks, let's go!
Put your bags up here! Let's hurry up!

54:17.004 --> 54:19.505
Friends, friends, don't worry.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.885
We shall find haven
for you in our own homes.

54:23.969 --> 54:27.805
And it won't cost you one cent more
than regular hotel rates.

54:33.145 --> 54:35.188
Paid up, that's ridiculous.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.197
My room ready?

54:44.281 --> 54:47.700
Two connecting rooms,
the best in the hotel.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.370
One for entertaining
your many new friends in town,

54:50.454 --> 54:52.246
and one for sleeping.

54:52.498 --> 54:55.124
If your conscience lets you sleep.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.961
Oh, I sleep just fine, ma'am.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.712
Is that so?

55:02.049 --> 55:04.300
You care to see for yourself?

55:14.645 --> 55:16.938
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.107
I like chicken, fried.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.194
And anything else?

55:23.529 --> 55:25.738
Best bottle of wine in town.

55:29.034 --> 55:31.661
Remember, he won't be around forever,
you little...

57:05.172 --> 57:06.380
Marshal.

58:42.436 --> 58:45.188
Somebody, please help me.

58:47.983 --> 58:49.192
What are you doing?

58:49.276 --> 58:51.068
- Let go of me! You've got to stop this!
- Not now!

58:51.153 --> 58:53.112
Let go of me!

59:03.207 --> 59:05.124
Damn you all to hell.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.257
How did you get in here?

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.261
You had your chance and you missed it.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.638
You're hurting me.
What do you want?

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:45.891
Just a little pleasant female company for supper.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.394
- You know what you are?
- What?

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.645
You're an animal.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.897
Yeah, well, you have a way
of bringing that out.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.442
No, thank you,
but I don't eat with dogs.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:57.862
You might, if it's the dog
that runs the pack.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.544
Give me a half an hour to get ready.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.421
You're ready right now.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.132
I could be readier.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.762
Half an hour.

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:38.277
You know, actually, I eat like a bird.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.780
I've got it.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:45.284
I knew that old bastard Hobart had it
in a hole under the store.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:46.786
Look. But I've got it.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.371
Yeah, all the way from France.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:52.291
Yeah, would you stick a bent knife in that,
get the cork out?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.961
Do you have any special request for dessert?

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.840
No, I've already taken care of that.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:18.901
Can't fix that without a blacksmith or a vet.
Maybe both.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.654
Hell, we'll find neither one out here.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.532
Well, I'll tell you something, Stace.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.784
I think we've been pushing too hard.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:30.496
I mean, like as not, all three of these horses
could have come up lame.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.500
Hell, I feel pretty lame myself,
not being on a horse 12 months in that damn jail.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.584
Back off, Cole.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:38.671
Maybe we ought to leave you
and the horse here.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.298
Well, now, Stace, I didn't mean nothing.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:45.261
Hell, Stacey, he can ride double with me
until we come across somebody.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.887
We'll all need fresh animals.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.849
All right! Quit crying about it.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.109
I'll tell you what, though.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.445
Soon as they find those bodies back there,

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.156
they're gonna have a hunting party out for us.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:10.119
And I want time to take one year
of my life out of Lago

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.579
before we move on.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:14.415
How long is that gonna take, you figure?

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.543
A lifetime for some of them.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.093
You're out late, Mordecai.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.609
...and fornication and sins of the flesh.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.194
That's what's going on under my roof

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:26.987
right now while I'm talking to you.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.365
That stranger has taken over
my whole hotel,

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:32.910
and thrown good, honest, decent folk
right out into the night.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:36.288
Well, why didn't you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.624
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.210
We're tired of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job!

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.545
Don't you talk to me that way!

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.171
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.257
Please! Look at us!

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.717
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.719
That's right.
It's just like the preacher says.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.514
That stranger's got everybody in this town
at each other's throats.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:55.516
He's set himself up like a king!

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.228
He's got you all snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:03.399
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons of blood-red paint.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.777
It couldn't be worse if the devil himself
had ridden right into Lago.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.372
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.925
Get out of here!

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.227
They're here, Father!

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:46.979
I'm sorry.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.633
Morg!

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.213
Morg!

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:19.051
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:23.015
Morg? Morg, you better take me with you.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.185
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.104
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.314
Get off my cuffs. Let's go!

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.874
Oh, no.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:08.435
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me that they wouldn't...

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.167
Ruined.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.002
A total loss.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.171
Didn't even touch my store.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.091
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.219
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.805
- I'm not your goddamn sheriff.
- You!

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.725
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.810
I'll need four boxes from you,

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.689
and shovels from you,
so these people can dig the holes.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:57.150
Well, yes...
But I thought perhaps we could...

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.111
Right now.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.488
Yeah. All right, everyone.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.701
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.413
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.249
Yeah. Well...

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.586
- Get the shovel, will you?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:24.720
I hope you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:29.308
Because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:32.728
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:37.482
Well, maybe a little bonus
will make you a little more appreciative.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:40.485
How little?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.862
500 a head.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:46.074
500 an ear?

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.326
Done. Done.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.757
$3,000?

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.760
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.386
after what he did to my hotel?

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.348
Promising's one thing. Paying's another.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.601
He may just catch a bullet.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.566
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:25.197
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know how far you could go.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:28.158
Well, you still don't.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.497
Well, it doesn't matter to you.

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.168
I don't know where you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.213
All the rooms are ruined
except for our room.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.851
Wait. Wait a minute.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.896
Oh, no.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.400
Oh, no. No.

01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:04.903
No, let go, let go! Lewis!

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.155
Lewis, don't just stand there.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.366
Let go of me! Let go!

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:13.662
Stop! Look, you don't need me.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.998
Let go! Let go!

01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:21.294
Let go of me!

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:28.844
What are you gonna do with those?

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.804
Defend myself.

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.389
Against what?

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.559
It's no secret what you did
to Callie Travers.

01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:36.852
Did?

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.145
The other day in the stable.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.109
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.695
I promise you, I won't.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.365
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.409
I flatter myself?

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:58.290
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,
but a man's got to get his rest sometime.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.376
Oblige me?

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.505
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back in about a half-hour,

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.215
I'll see what I can do, all right?

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.470
Why, you low-down, stinking, son of a...

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.878
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.049
I've heard a lot of things. Why?

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.676
He was town marshal here.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.097
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:59.518
They say the dead don't rest
without a marker of some kind.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.063
Do you believe that?

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.441
What makes you think I care?

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:07.651
I don't know.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.863
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:15.742
I was going to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.413
What's funny?

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:23.542
You ask me that in a blown-up hotel

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:26.169
with seven dead men to your credit already?

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.632
I was just stopping by
for a bottle of whiskey

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.385
and a nice hot bath.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:36.888
All right. If you say so.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.100
You don't believe me?

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:47.149
Mister, whatever you say
is fine with me.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.324
Be careful.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:02.914
You're a man who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:06.668
Well, it's what people know
about themselves inside

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.670
that makes them afraid.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.978
I don't know if we shouldn't
mark the grave somehow.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.229
Sam?

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.024
I don't see any need.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:32.319
Ain't likely that anybody's
gonna cry over them anyhow.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.378
You know what to do.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:51.671
Yes, sir, Captain.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.759
All right!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.679
Everybody grab a brush and start in.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.643
You mean, you want the whole place painted?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.144
Everything.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.980
You can't possibly mean the church, too.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.857
I mean especially the church.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.029
All right, I'll paint
if you say we've got to,

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:19.658
but when we get done,
this place is gonna look like hell.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.354
Hello, Lewis.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:07.747
I want you to go to that meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:08.873
No.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:12.085
Not now, not ever.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:15.255
They are still your neighbors!

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.550
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:22.387
Hiding behind words
like "faith," "peace," and "trust."

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.514
Good words. Damn good words.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.850
But we hid a murder behind them.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.977
Won't you never understand, woman?

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.021
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.815
When Duncan found out the mine
was on government property,

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.859
it was just a technicality, really,

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.819
but he was determined to turn us in.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.946
Wouldn't listen to reason.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.075
Is that why?
Is that really why it happened?

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:48.413
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have closed down the mine!

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.457
Do you know what would've happened
to this town then?

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.084
It would've been the end
of everything that we've worked on.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:56.212
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:04.179
Now, sometimes we have to do
what's necessary to do,

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:06.181
for the good of everybody.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:07.849
That's the price of progress.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:10.894
And what's the price of a human life, Lewis?

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.022
Ask your good friends
if they know that.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.109
Your damn conscience.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:22.739
I'll say, it's sure taken
a hell of a while to bother you.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:27.952
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.053
That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:30.723
Well, now, what's he doing,
riding around here like that?

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.727
He's come back to pay us back
for some jail time that was rightfully his.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.729
Only he don't know it yet.

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:57.542
Stacey, help me.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.628
My arm. Help me.

01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:07.510
Help me, Stacey.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.307
I'm curious, Morg.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.643
You helped them railroad us,

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:19.147
and you've got the balls to come down here
and ask us for a favor?

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:21.483
Goddamn if I don't admire you.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.195
Do something about my arm, Stacey.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.780
Well, I am doing something, Morg.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:30.658
Sitting here watching you bleed to death.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:36.581
Stacey, things have changed in Lago.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:39.542
You need me.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.965
I gotta tell you about it.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:45.967
I gotta tell you about it.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.010
Yeah. From the looks of your arm, Morg,

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:52.430
it looks like you've run your welcome
out in Lago, and ours, too.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:54.849
What me and the boys want to know

01:20:54.934 --> 01:20:57.352
is how we're gonna pick up
12 months' back pay

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:58.728
and everything else that's owed us.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.355
Stacey, for God's sakes!

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:02.273
No, no. For our sake.

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:04.192
Now you can help us, all right,

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.401
and you can help yourself, too.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:08.988
Now you just give me
the combination to that big iron box

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:10.365
in the back of your office,

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.009
and me and the boys will just...

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:14.869
seak right in there

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:17.997
real quiet-like, take what's ours,
bring you the rest,

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.917
or leave it there safe and sound,
that's up to you.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.546
First, of course, we'll fix up your arm,

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:26.923
set you over there in the shade

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.342
with a nice canteen full of water.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.804
You no-good, worthless son of a bitch.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:35.306
You're probably right about that.

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:41.187
Give me that combination, Morg.

01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:44.732
I wouldn't give you the combination
to the gates of hell.

01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:55.451
Dog!

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:58.705
Sure had a lot of blood left in him,
didn't he?

01:22:07.298 --> 01:22:10.174
Two sticks of dynamite will take care
of that iron box, anyway.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.968
We don't need him.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.154
Dan, you hit?

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:32.280
I don't know.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.407
I don't think so.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.868
Damn near tore my leg off!

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.833
Who the hell is that?

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:45.793
Must be Dave Drake.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.382
What the hell did you hit?

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.778
Keep shooting, damn it!

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:13.363
He shot my ear off!

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.657
Somebody up there's playing games.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:17.367
He shot my ear off!

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:24.248
Well, he could've shot your whole damn head off!
Now get down!

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.212
Dave, is that you?

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.261
Come on out! We'll settle this.

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:49.232
Morg was almost dead, anyway,
from that arm!

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.819
I just put him out of his misery!

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.588
I'll kill you!

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:16.426
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.098
Come down out of there, you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:25.351
Let's go up there, Stacey.
There might be some more dynamite.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:28.730
I'll get him. I'll get him,
whoever it was up there.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.899
I'll kill every man in Lago!

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.235
The guests are on their way to the party,

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.779
so gather all the people together.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:21.032
Right, Captain!
All right, men, get that sign up!

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:31.292
Come on! They're coming!

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:46.098
All right, everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.861
I want you up in that tower.

01:25:58.946 --> 01:26:00.822
First sign of dust,
you ring the bell, you hear?

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.907
Are you sure this is gonna be all right?

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.951
It's gonna be all right.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:12.124
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:18.422
What's the matter with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.424
Bang, bang, bang!

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:25.763
All right, everybody,
I think we're expected outside.

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:28.850
I just hope that shooter we hired
is feeling up to snuff.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.018
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.860
Let's go.

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:33.915
Hey, <i>señor,</i> can we come
to the <i>fiesta?</i>

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:35.124
No.

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:41.088
I want everybody to have plenty of those.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:58.356
Hey, ain't it about time
we got out there, huh?

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.610
There's plenty of time.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.862
Yeah, but they'll be here
any damn minute.

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:07.073
I think Sam's right. We ought to.

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.240
Yeah.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.284
What about after?

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.704
What about after we do it?

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.624
What do we do then?

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:20.211
Then you live with it.

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:37.311
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna take the first shot?

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:41.482
Are you gonna get Stacey Bridges first?

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:44.652
Or maybe you're gonna get
all three by yourself?

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:53.452
When are you gonna give the signal?

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.830
I'm not. You are.

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:10.845
You old people, move out of here!

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.110
Here they come!

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:44.874
Come on!

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.500
Fire!

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:50.171
Fire! Fire!

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:22.786
Get them.

01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:13.003
Don't shoot me. Don't! Don't.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:19.802
A party? A party?

01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:31.522
Welcome home party, huh?

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:39.780
Well, here's to your party.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.375
Give me another bottle.

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:56.588
Give me another bottle!

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.146
Well, now the party's over.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.480
- Stace!
- Let go of me!

01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:15.816
Look what I found in the bushes.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.111
Look what I found in the bushes!

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:26.577
Stacey, it was always you.

01:34:28.038 --> 01:34:30.247
That's why Morg Allen hated you.

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:34.752
He knew how much I loved you.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:40.174
Yeah, I bet you just cried yourself
to sleep every night

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:43.761
thinking about me in that territorial prison.

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:48.724
But I did. I really did!

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:51.435
Yeah, well, I can see it all now.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:57.274
You lying there in Morg Allen's bed,
just a-crying and a-humping.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.777
Oh, no, no!

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:01.945
Give me that bottle.

01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:09.119
Cole, go and get the horses ready.

01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:10.954
You got it, Stace.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.834
Stacey. Stacey, you're gonna take me
with you, aren't you?

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:21.131
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:26.678
You still here?
