[birds chirping]

00:14.305 --> 00:16.474
Look! It stopped snowing.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.894
People can get here this afternoon
for our pet food drive.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.313
This town loves our Holiday Open House.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.108
They donate so much food
to Dr. Singh's charity.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.278
Afterwards, our quiet
friends-and-family dinner.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.946
I love our dinner!

00:30.405 --> 00:32.490
Too bad your parents have to work.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.660
It's okay.
I'll celebrate with them tomorrow.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.454
Skye! Help!

00:38.121 --> 00:40.248
-Gotta go!
-[laughs]

00:41.583 --> 00:42.876
What's the emergency?

00:42.959 --> 00:45.920
I can't unfreeze the screen
with dough on my fingers.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.007
-I'm stuck. [chuckles]
-Ah, that's not an emergency.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.260
I didn't say it was an emergency,
I said I need help.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.637
[tablet beeps]

00:54.721 --> 00:56.931
[narrator]
Pie dough requires a light touch.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.309
Next, wrap dough in plastic and chill--

00:59.392 --> 01:02.812
-Ooh. Is there an, uh, emergency?
-[Billy] Uh...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.981
Mom got dough on her fingers.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.275
-[phone chimes]
-Oh, hey.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.694
Got a text from my old colleague, Carol.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.822
"Call Carol."

01:13.448 --> 01:15.784
You use voice commands now?

01:16.201 --> 01:19.287
-I may be old, but I'm not entirely--
-[phone chimes]

01:19.370 --> 01:23.333
-[phone voice] Call Car Repair.
-Call Carol.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.335
-[phone chimes]
-Carols are songs

01:25.418 --> 01:27.712
traditionally sung at Christmas.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.548
[Grandpa] Call Carol!

01:30.965 --> 01:32.592
Frozen again!

01:32.675 --> 01:35.512
I need to know how many minutes!

01:35.887 --> 01:39.098
It's 30 minutes.
We went through this last year, Mom.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.601
Is this the same video from last year?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.312
Oh, no. Those pies were like cement.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.566
Skye, I gotta start over.
Can you help me, please?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.444
Can't. Gotta clear the pond,
check the reindeer,

01:51.528 --> 01:54.364
make decorations, lots to do.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.866
Open Housers will be here
in a couple of hours.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.327
-[Billy sighs]
-Hi, Carol.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.706
Well, take his temperature.
Yeah. No, I'll wait.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.876
You Ponysitters are super busy.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.421
Yeah. The Building a Snowman
competition is a "go."

02:10.505 --> 02:13.800
If there's too much snow,
we're not gonna be able to skate.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.803
And skating's
our biggest attraction. [sighs]

02:16.886 --> 02:21.224
And you know, the reindeer farmer.
You never really can count on that guy.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.019
You know the parts didn't come in
for Grandpa to fix the tractor?

02:25.562 --> 02:26.896
No sleigh rides.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.316
I know now. I'll cross that off.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.277
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

02:32.652 --> 02:36.406
At least Grandpa's dressing up
for Take Your Picture with Santa.

02:39.742 --> 02:43.413
Hey, are those your, uh, famous
teeth-shattering mincemeat pies?

02:43.621 --> 02:47.750
Oh, don't worry.
I am using a new recipe this year.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.460
-[chuckles]
-Less cement-y.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.008
Hey, Carol? Yeah.
What's his temperature up to now?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.095
Okay.

02:59.178 --> 03:03.099
-Uh... less cement-y pies.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.062
[sighs] Too much snow.
It keeps blowing back on the rink.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.190
We're shoveling it
as fast as the wind blows it on.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.275
Fingers crossed. Stay positive.

03:54.859 --> 03:59.864

-Positive we need less snow.

What do you think?
Won't it be perfect for Santa's throne?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.088
I think it will be perfect.
I like your vision.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.130

04:24.639 --> 04:28.643

04:34.524 --> 04:36.776
Uh-oh, you look like something's wrong.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.988
The farmer that lets us
use the reindeer called and said

04:40.071 --> 04:42.407
the reindeer can't make it this year.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.034
Not even one?
At least last year we had one.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.662
Well, he said they had colds.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.542
No reindeer petting zoo.
No tractor sleigh rides.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.419
Maybe no skating.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.838
Our Holiday Open House is falling apart.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.674
We need people
to donate to the pet food drive.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.343
Dr. Singh's clinic is depending on us.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.308
Reindeers catch colds.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.060
I know, right? That's like...

05:11.728 --> 05:12.687
like...

05:13.730 --> 05:15.481
What is that like?

05:15.732 --> 05:18.151
Like a bee who's allergic to flowers.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.236
[laughing]

05:20.320 --> 05:22.572
It's really like totally bad luck.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.950
We invited the whole town
to drop by Rescue Ranch,

05:26.034 --> 05:30.288
just to say thanks for all the support
they give us and the animals.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.583
And let them have a little fun
with their neighbors.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.419
And now we can't even come through.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.881
Without our activities,
there is no Open House.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.884
And no donations
to Dr. Singh's pet clinic.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.011
[Isabella] Can't we save Open House?

05:45.386 --> 05:48.681
My first Christmas here,
I don't want to let the animals down.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.768
Isabella, you're right.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.271
We have to make this
the best Open House ever.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.523
For the animals.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.567
Ponysitters are on it!

06:00.568 --> 06:02.195
[doorbell ringing]

06:07.533 --> 06:08.367
Oh, no!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.953
It's Dr. Singh from the animal hospital.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.456
-Stall her.
-[Olivia] Oh, my gosh.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.467
-What do we tell her?
-How about the truth?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.095
-We have no reindeer.
-We'll work around it.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.554
We have no tractor.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.098
There's always a way.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.935
The good news is, there is pretty much
nothing left to go wrong.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.938
Sorry, I gotta go on a house call.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.148
But you'll be back, right?

06:39.232 --> 06:43.111
-That depends how he responds.
-You're Santa. You have to be back.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.655
I will do my very best.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.782
Okay, so, um, maybe I was wrong.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.576
Now, there is seriously
nothing to go wrong.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.664
-Hey, guys. Dr. Singh is here.
-[Skye] Oh.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.001
-[group] Hi!
-[Dr. Singh] I should have called.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.380
But I wanted to see first-hand
what you might tell my ears.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.882
So? How's everything with the food drive?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.384
[all] Um...

07:07.009 --> 07:10.346
Dr. Singh, are you hungry?
I'm going to make mincemeat pies.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.809
Oh, I remember those from last year.
I still have one as a doorstop.

07:14.892 --> 07:15.852
[laughter]

07:15.935 --> 07:18.646
Yeah. We have a new recipe this year.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.399
-Chewable.
-Thank you, but I couldn't.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.819
My stomach is in knots
worrying about the Pet Food Drive.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.573
Everything is still under control,
isn't it, Ponysitters?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.741
-That's what we're discussing.
-Yeah!

07:30.825 --> 07:32.452
Um, can I take your coat?

07:33.035 --> 07:35.204
That's okay.
I have something precious.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.540
So? Tell me about your events.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.793
There's not gonna be a petting zoo.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.796
The reindeer canceled
on account of having colds.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.174
They're sick from the colds?

07:46.549 --> 07:49.886
So we'll create another activity.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.804
And no sleigh rides.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.807
But we'll figure out something new.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.936
Oh, um, we can, um...
we can build snowmen.

07:59.020 --> 08:03.774
Yes! And there is
a 50-50 chance of skating.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.736
-Yeah.
-We can take pictures.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.114
But not with Santa.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.617
We're discussing a backup plan for that.

08:13.034 --> 08:17.663
Okay. I still have those
large twisted knots in my stomach.

08:18.706 --> 08:22.001
But I see that you Ponysitters
have terrific determination.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.464
Dr. Singh, I think your coat moved.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.341
I have something precious!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.469
Now you have helped us all year,

08:31.552 --> 08:34.472
and the need for pet donations
is never greater.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.642
-But I understand if you want--
-We're not canceling.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.810
-We're not?
-No.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.649
-Still doing the food drive?
-Yes. Your animals will not go hungry.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.484
You always do come through.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.778
And speaking of animals...

08:52.573 --> 08:54.408
[all gasp, sigh]

08:54.492 --> 08:58.621
[Dr. Singh] This is Precious.
She should be the Food Drive mascot.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.665
She's adorable!

09:01.207 --> 09:03.042
You'll find her a great home.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.628
Open House! Very exciting!

09:05.711 --> 09:09.382
[light cheering]

09:12.468 --> 09:14.595
Sounds like we're gonna have an event.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.015
The only question is, how?

09:27.525 --> 09:28.651
Hey, Carol!

09:31.070 --> 09:34.949
-I got here as fast as I could.
-Oh, Dillon. I'm so glad to see you.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.910
I've been practically worried sick
about Shep.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.414
-And the weather's gonna take a turn.
-Let's take a look.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.957
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.294
Hey, buddy. Aw.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.049
Number one, "Reindeer Petting Zoo."

09:52.133 --> 09:54.302
Ideas, anyone?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.597
-I'm thinking...
-[distant whinnying]

09:58.097 --> 09:59.849
Alternative reindeer.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.226
[chuckles] Alternative reindeer?

10:03.352 --> 10:05.187
Alternative reindeer.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.860
-Speedy! [whistles] Come here, boy.
-[barking]

10:12.570 --> 10:13.738
[Trish] Sit.

10:14.196 --> 10:18.409
I give you, a little-known reindeer
known as "Muncher."

10:18.492 --> 10:20.911
His antlers having fully grown in yet.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.081
"Santa and his teeny flying huskies"?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.335
Are we rewriting history? With Speedy?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.461
[laughter]

10:29.003 --> 10:31.922
This breed of dog
does pull another kind of sleigh.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.218
Okay, I'm really liking this.
This is gonna be fun.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.929
-I'm with you, Speedy!
-[yips]

10:41.057 --> 10:43.768
Uh, number two, "Building a Snowman."

10:44.644 --> 10:46.437
-Are we still good?
-Good to go.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.773
We have carrot noses and grape eyes.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.610
-You find arms and mouths yourselves.
-We can check that one off.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.945
-Yes! High-ten.
-[barks]

10:56.781 --> 10:58.449
Number three, "Skating."

10:58.532 --> 11:00.576
Still a 50-50 chance with the wind.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.914
Uh, number four, "Sleigh Rides",
that's a no.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.708
Uh, number five, "Pictures with Santa."

11:08.125 --> 11:11.337
-Camera's all set up.
-Chair and picture frames ready.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.589
Santa is not ready.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.928
I'm all in with this awesome
Christmas husky thing,

11:19.011 --> 11:21.889
but Christmas isn't Christmas
without Santa.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.642
So let's find ourselves a Santa.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.354
-We can do this. Come on.
-Okay.

11:36.237 --> 11:40.116
Here we go! We have the outfit.
All we need is someone to wear it.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.119
-Okay.
-Hello, darlings.

11:43.869 --> 11:48.666
Shelby and I just had to drop by
to make a donation to your Pet Food Drive.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.628
It's a sizeable donation, you know.

11:52.711 --> 11:55.506
We have ten bags of doggie kibble

11:55.589 --> 12:00.136
and another ten bags of kitty food.
Large ones.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.887
[Skye] Thank you.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.975
Um, Dr. Singh is going to be able to help
a lot of owners in need

12:06.058 --> 12:09.645
to keep pets instead of being
forced to give them to rescues.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.481
Oh, no "thank you" necessary.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.777
My joy is in the pureness of giving.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.239
Yeah, the more you give, the more
you receive. Right, Mom?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.658
What are you doing?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.829
Um... red is your color.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.998
-Yes.
-[Bianca] Oh.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.917
-Oh, yes. I thought so.
-[Skye chuckles]

12:36.839 --> 12:39.300
How did Shelby convince Bianca to do it?

12:39.675 --> 12:44.221
Well, uh, she told her
that Santa was the star of the show.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.682
Star? This isn't dinner theater.

12:46.765 --> 12:52.480
Okay, people, places, everyone.
Dress rehearsal. Santa's big moment.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.941
And don't say I didn't warn you.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.193
[chuckles]

12:57.276 --> 12:58.611
-Oh, uh...
-Oh...

13:00.988 --> 13:04.200
In three, two, one...

13:04.575 --> 13:06.368
Ah... [sighs]

13:08.996 --> 13:12.875
But what's in a name?

13:13.042 --> 13:17.254
That which we call a rose

13:17.338 --> 13:19.924
By any other name would smell...

13:20.007 --> 13:22.843
[sniffs] ah, as sweet.

13:23.344 --> 13:28.140
Um, Mother?
Just to clarify, this isn't a play.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.142
It's an immersive experience.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.522
Immerse yourself in your surroundings
and pretend to be Santa.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.733
Pretend? But I don't pretend.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.694
I-- I act!

13:40.778 --> 13:43.864
Well, if you won't pretend,

13:43.948 --> 13:47.618
then I'm afraid this immersion
is just not for you.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.036
Next!

13:49.453 --> 13:54.333
Well, then I say "phooey"
to your pretend immersion

13:54.833 --> 13:59.672
and long live the genius of Shakespeare!

-Yeah...

[whinnying]

14:19.400 --> 14:20.818
Me? Santa?

14:20.901 --> 14:23.821
The children are expecting photos
with Santa.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.573
Can you do it?

14:26.073 --> 14:27.950
[Dr. Singh] A huge responsibility.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.289
It's easy. Just put on the hat
and say, "Ho, ho, ho."

14:33.664 --> 14:36.458
What an honor!
I won't let the children down.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.419
-Yes!
-Thank you.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.383
All right, make sure
everyone's enjoying our Open House.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.968
-Got it!
-[chuckles]

14:46.844 --> 14:49.680
[Skye] Aw, hey! That's so cute.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.181
Wow, that's awesome.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.518
I had him for four years,
and he's super fast.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.897
[yawns]

14:59.064 --> 15:02.109
Okay, who's next
to take the picture with Santa?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.068
[kids giggling]

15:03.360 --> 15:06.822
[Dr. Singh] Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.033
Hey, little one. Wanna sit on my lap?

15:10.284 --> 15:13.662
-What would you like for Christmas?
-I would like a toy.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.582
[Dr. Singh] A toy?
Can you be more specific?

15:16.665 --> 15:18.417
A... a big toy.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.129
A big toy! Ho, ho, ho! Any more details?

15:22.212 --> 15:24.214
Bigger than what my sister gets.

15:24.298 --> 15:28.969
I don't want your sister upset.
So maybe you get the same size toy.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.514
Is that okay? Yeah?
Now, you're gonna look at Olivia.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.224
Say "cheese!"

15:34.433 --> 15:35.768
-[boy] Cheese!
-Cheese.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.103
Oh, that's a great one. Yeah.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.523
Ah, we did it, Skye. We pulled it off.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.275
We're already out of carrots.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.737
Girls, all of our guests
are loving this Open House.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.282
I know. And look at all
the food donations under the tree!

15:50.950 --> 15:53.410
-It's a miracle!
-It's an awesome miracle.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.622
-Our Holiday Open House is a success!
-[laughing]

15:56.705 --> 15:57.957
[Dr. Singh] Bye!

15:58.749 --> 15:59.833
[birds chirping]

16:02.044 --> 16:03.879
[Grandpa] He's a bit dehydrated.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.050
We got fluids running, and I'm gonna
give him something for the pain.

16:10.177 --> 16:14.139
Tell me I'm not gonna lose Shep.
Not during the holidays. Please.

16:14.556 --> 16:18.560
You know, he's been in good health
until now. That makes me hopeful.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.775
Ew, ew, ew.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.402
That's gotta hurt.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.488
Probably why he's not eating or drinking.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.782
Is it life-threatening?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.575
Well, in my experience,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.912
it's probably, uh, a twig or a splinter

16:36.996 --> 16:40.916
-or a bone shard from something he ate.
-You'll be okay, boy.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.669
Yeah, we'll remove it,

16:43.752 --> 16:46.338
clean up the abscess,
and he's gonna be fine.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.758
And if it isn't?

16:51.051 --> 16:53.095
Ah, let's just hope it is.

It's an emergency weather alert.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.083
Tomorrow's storm is moving through
faster than we expected.

17:23.667 --> 17:28.255
Like, now! We'd better get everyone
on their way home right now.

when they did.

Um, Mom, have you heard anything
from Grandpa?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.026
He's not gonna miss our dinner?

Don't know.
He might not be able to leave Shep.

What if my dad can't get here?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.700
And if my mom can't get here either?

Now, Shep and I are going to be in a house
that's filled with people, and animals.

-Thank you for inviting me.
-You're welcome.

the animals from your practice.

Shep and I
love being surrounded by them.

if we can get through the snow.

county got us through.
