00:02.200 --> 00:04.407
NARRATOR: <i>For centuries,
life's big questions</i>

00:04.480 --> 00:07.643
<i>have challenged
some of the world's greatest minds.</i>

00:08.280 --> 00:11.523
<i>The need for love, marriage
and lifelong commitment.</i>

00:11.600 --> 00:15.764
<i>The yearning to reproduce
and the survival of the human race.</i>

00:15.840 --> 00:20.004
<i>The search for a vocation,
the desire to find happiness</i>

00:20.080 --> 00:23.880
<i>and the inevitable end, death.</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:28.250
<i>But Karl Pilkington has not given
a second thought to any of these issues.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:31.164
This cat's cross-eyed.
I've never seen that before.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.562
NARRATOR: <i>Now he's turned 40,
he thinks it's time he did.</i>

00:34.640 --> 00:35.926
(BURPS)

00:36.000 --> 00:37.240
<i>He's travelling around the world to see</i>

00:37.320 --> 00:40.449
<i>how other people deal with
life's big questions.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.207
KARL: <i>We've had the Iron Age,
the Stone Age.</i>

00:44.280 --> 00:45.850
<i>This is the Pissing About Age.</i>

00:47.120 --> 00:49.771
NARRATOR: <i>And to see if the issues
are such a big deal, anyway.</i>

00:52.360 --> 00:55.967
<i>In this episode, Karl finds out
how to deal with death.</i>

00:56.040 --> 00:57.929
I don't know what to do!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.126
(WAILING)

00:59.200 --> 01:01.168
NARRATOR: <i>What's the best
final resting place?</i>

01:01.240 --> 01:03.891
Oh, shit. If I Lived there, I wouldn't
be doing this with me granddad.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.930
I'd ?y tip it.
All me family'd be left round here.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.442
NARRATOR: <i>And comes face to
face with death.</i>

01:09.520 --> 01:12.000
I should record something for the
start of the programme saying,

01:12.080 --> 01:14.003
"What you're about to see is mental,

01:14.080 --> 01:16.560
"so if you can't handle weird shit,
watch summat else."

01:16.640 --> 01:18.722
KARL: I can't move her that way
and I can't move her that way.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.290
Watch her head. Watch her head.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.442
NARRATOR: <i>This is</i> The Moaning of Life.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.170
KARL: <i>It's like, who's the
mental one here?</i>

01:24.240 --> 01:26.527
Is it me or everyone else?

01:33.600 --> 01:34.647
Death.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.885
It annoys me the amount of
land that's being taken up

01:38.400 --> 01:39.561
by the dead.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.730
You know, burials and all that.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.529
When you think that, there's not that
much land, is there,

01:43.600 --> 01:44.886
for people to live on.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.327
You know, houses are getting smaller
'cause there's not enough land.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.131
Population's growing. There's just
not enough space for everyone.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.249
And yet you've got, like,
big fields taken up

01:53.320 --> 01:54.845
by dead bodies.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.968
They always get the nicest places
as well, dead bodies.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.964
When you think of graveyards it's always
like a nice, little, quiet area, innit?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.168
And yet people who are living,

02:02.680 --> 02:04.808
you're in, like, a shitty
area where it's all

02:04.880 --> 02:07.201
noisy and horrible and grey
and what have you.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.205
I say put the dead bodies in
the shitty areas.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.930
You could put them in the
motorways and stuff.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.331
'Cause they're always diggin' the
road up anyway,

02:13.400 --> 02:14.401
aren't they? There's loads of holes.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.847
Orin, sort of, the middle
of a roundabout, maybe.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.922
That's a little bit of land that doesn't
get used.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.331
They're not gonna build a house on that.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.403
So stick dead bodies under that.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:48.800 --> 02:52.566
Prawn. Chocolate éclair. Hair dryer.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.444
Have you ever seen a showroom like it?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.123
Well, how do you stick a body in there?

02:58.080 --> 03:01.880
Look at that. Unless something happened
to you and, you know, you were in bits.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.886
Stick the head there. Couple of hands.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.006
Feet.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.803
There's something about this that you
just go "yeah, it's fine, yeah, good."

03:17.120 --> 03:18.565
You can imagine having a laugh.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.531
I don't think people would be stood
around crying and moping.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.003
Imagine, if you're there and the
vicar's going on about your gran.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.924
Saying that, you know, she liked going
to church on a Sunday.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.445
She made lovely cakes.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.329
And then they brought
her down in a crab.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.805
Everyone would laugh.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.486
You'd have a good memory of it.
It's sort of a celebration of your life.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.927
"Oh, what was she like?"
"1 didn't know she liked crabs.“

03:38.000 --> 03:40.241
Gets people talking.
"Why's she picked a crab?"

03:43.280 --> 03:45.248
Are you, uh, you looking to buy?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.450
A car?

03:49.520 --> 03:50.851
KARL: Why are you getting a car?

03:56.480 --> 03:57.845
What is that? It's a Lada.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.284
And how would they get him in this?
Was he a big man, or...

04:05.040 --> 04:07.008
- He's the size of you?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.969
- Yeah, that's the size.
- And they're gonna get him in a Lada?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.849
They needed a bigger...

04:11.920 --> 04:13.809
I've never even thought about it.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.690
I'm gonna die one day.
But I have no idea what...

04:22.720 --> 04:24.051
KARL: So, what are you having?

04:24.120 --> 04:25.167
Yeah.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.361
You're having a pen?

04:32.760 --> 04:33.921
- Yeah, like a Bic pen.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.002
- What, you're gonna be in a big pen?
- Yeah.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.009
Why?

04:40.840 --> 04:41.887
Yeah.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.206
I'd have thought you'd have
gone for a, uh...

04:46.600 --> 04:48.170
Like, a blackboard duster.

04:48.560 --> 04:49.891
Cause it's the shape of a coffin.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.769
That'd be good if that lifted up,
you could see his head.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.571
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, lift it up.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.608
KARL: So, anything that I came up with,
you can make?

05:04.680 --> 05:05.920
KARL: No matter what it is?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.081
This. I sort of travel around.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.570
Yeah. But, I'm sick of aeroplanes.
I'm always on aeroplanes.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.528
I really don't know, I don't know, urn...

05:30.600 --> 05:32.364
Should it come to you, just like that?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.807
- Should this be an easy decision?
- You know,

05:44.320 --> 05:46.482
-got them at garage.
-Hey.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.648
- Ah, Twix.
- Twix, you not heard of Twix?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.485
It's one of the, sort of,
little treats that I like.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.729
I don't know if it's ever been done but,
I've got a girlfriend.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.770
CARPENTER: Yeah.
KARL: See with a Twix you get two bars.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.251
- I've already eaten one.
- Yeah.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.607
But, you get two bars in it,
so I'm thinking,

06:01.680 --> 06:03.682
one coffin, two spaces.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.484
- Yeah.
- So, only one cost.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.042
Two people.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.964
KARL: Will I leave that with you?
CARPENTER: Okay. (LAUGHING)

06:15.760 --> 06:17.728
What do you reckon to the Twix idea?

06:18.120 --> 06:19.724
RICHARD: I'm not sure.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.762
KARL: I think the idea of being with
Suzanne's quite nice.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.811
She doesn't like talking about death.
So, in a way, I've sorted it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.526
So I don't worry about it.
"You're gonna be in a Twix."

06:30.080 --> 06:31.764
I think that's quite a nice thing to say

06:31.840 --> 06:34.446
that I want, you know,
I want us to rot together.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.124
In one box. It's sort of more
environmentally friendly. Money-saving.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.246
RICHARD: So, what's going on?

06:43.400 --> 06:44.970
Just going to me first funeral.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.811
(CHUCKLES)

06:47.120 --> 06:48.406
Mad, isn't it?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.643
KARL: <i>I don't know that much about it.</i>

06:51.720 --> 06:52.960
<i>I don? know what the jobs are.</i>

06:53.040 --> 06:55.691
<i>Don't know what I'm meant
to be expected to do.</i>

06:56.760 --> 06:58.410
It's a funeral, innit?

06:59.160 --> 07:00.889
How much is there to do at a funeral?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.564
So, it's not... She's not in a coffin?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.690
- All right.
- Yeah.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.166
KARL: Hey.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.324
KARL: Jesus, how old was she?

07:50.640 --> 07:52.688
Right, so... What, what, what...

07:53.440 --> 07:55.442
- I'm helping the Ice Man.
- Yes.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.167
All right.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.205
This is my first-ever funeral.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.851
- I've never been to a funeral.
- ICE MAN: Oh, okay. Okay, okay.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.891
Well...

08:10.880 --> 08:13.087
KARL: Right, okay then. Let's, uh...

08:13.800 --> 08:15.564
Let's get on with it, then.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.045
- Make her up?
- Yeah.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.363
- All right, then what? just...
- Yeah.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.486
Like that?

08:36.520 --> 08:39.171
Proper weird. Proper,
proper, proper weird.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.763
KARL: All like that, yeah?
ICE MAN: Yeah.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.207
(SIGHING)

08:46.280 --> 08:48.248
She's gonna look like a right tranny.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.089
You know, like Eddie Izzard,
somebody like that. Letting me on her.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.810
'Cause I don't do make-up.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.087
I don't use make-up so I don't
know how to put it on.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.010
It doesn't look good.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.406
She Looked better when we
hadn't even touched her.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.608
Just left in a corner of a room,
lying there.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.165
I don't know what we've done.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.722
I swear it feels like she's gonna jump
up in a minute and say it's all a joke.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.721
(SIGHING)

09:14.800 --> 09:16.040
I mean, lookin' at her on the poster.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.009
It's not like it's the same woman,
is it?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.811
It's really weird. The poster's sort of
as dead as she is, isn't it?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.962
It's not moving or anything,
but there's life.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.202
There's life there, isn't there?
Even though it's a photo.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.809
Not for me, this.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.685
KARL: <i>Jesus, she's heavy, isn't she?</i>

09:34.320 --> 09:35.606
I'm pushing.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.200
- More?
- More.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.443
Right, that's far as her
legs are gonna go.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.681
More, more.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.410
- No, it's not gonna go any more.
- More.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.448
- More.
- It's not gonna go any more.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.567
ICE MAN: It's ok.
KARL: That's it.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.651
You know, you're not allowed to
use that, are you? There's no way.

09:53.720 --> 09:57.805
It was mental, that. Playing Twister
with a dead 70-year-old woman.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.360
When I pick her up,
her feet are sliding.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.886
So how do we stop that?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.121
RICHARD: They're just loosening her up,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.010
so that they can move her limbs
around when they position her.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.128
But we just want to stand her up.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.845
What do you mean, "loosening her up"?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.968
She's not gonna be
doing fucking star jumps.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.406
She's been dead a month.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.651
If anything, if she's stood there,

10:15.720 --> 10:18.451
surely stiffness is the best
thing you can hope for, innit?

10:19.840 --> 10:22.081
You want her legs to be stiff
when she stands up.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.049
Okay, there she goes. Come on.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.969
ALL: One, two, three.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.610
KARL: Watch her head. Watch her head.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.205
Down, down, down, down.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.965
Okay, okay. (GRUNTING)

10:33.560 --> 10:35.130
KARL: Keep hold, keep hold of her.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.000
And when he's saying, "Pick her up,"

10:37.080 --> 10:38.730
I'm going, "Well, hang on.
just let me take this in."

10:38.800 --> 10:40.643
I've never been to anything
like this before.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.731
And he's going, "Pick her up."
It was like shifting a mattress.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.686
Do you know what I mean?
When you sort of go,

10:45.760 --> 10:46.966
"This should be easy,
it's just a person."

10:47.040 --> 10:49.520
This is just a mattress. Should be able
to move it from one room another.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.647
Have you ever shifted a mattress?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.290
- RICHARD: Yeah.
- It's awkward, innit?

10:52.400 --> 10:55.563
It goes every way you don't want it to
go and that's what it was like.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.122
KARL: Keep going.
ALL: One, two, three...

10:59.520 --> 11:02.251
KARL: I can't move her that way.
I can't move her that way.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.964
Oh,Jesus.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.526
KARL: That just looks shit, doesn't it?
It looks shit.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.561
Apparently, they've knocked the
idea of standing her up.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.642
Because it was a little bit
tricky, standing her up.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.089
So they've sat her in a chair.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.925
I think they redid the face, and urn...

11:24.000 --> 11:26.765
They've sat her in front
of, like, a stall

11:26.840 --> 11:28.729
'cause that's what she did
when she was alive.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.924
She sold food or something, so...

11:32.000 --> 11:35.482
That's the idea. They try to make it
look like she's still alive, basically.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.764
Ah, she looks a lot better.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.731
<i>Whereas, if it's something like</i>

24:07.800 --> 24:11.407
<i>emptying the dishwasher,
that thing of you take a pan out.</i>

24:11.480 --> 24:13.482
And you tip it upside down
and water goes everywhere.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.245
You get water on your feet.
And it's all of over the kitchen floor.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.685
I hate that job.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.444
So, that's how I'd like to die.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.000
Just have heart attack
getting out a frying pan.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.445
Because then, as I'm dying, I'm going,

24:24.520 --> 24:26.363
"Oh, I don't have to do
the rest of it. I hated it.“

24:43.120 --> 24:45.964
<i>I mean look at it,
it's massive, this place.</i>

24:46.160 --> 24:49.642
<i>If it was just dead bodies, what a waste
of space that would be, wouldn't it?</i>

24:51.320 --> 24:54.164
<i>Whereas people are
sort of using these things.</i>

24:54.520 --> 24:56.090
<i>The mausoleums.</i>

24:57.000 --> 24:59.401
<i>They're allowed to live in 'em.</i>

24:59.480 --> 25:01.005
It's like a little village.

25:01.080 --> 25:05.051
You've got shops, people flogging
drinks, crisps, peanuts.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.282
So if someone moves in there,
they make that the bed.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.321
I mean that is like something you'd
see in Bensons for Beds, innit?

25:13.400 --> 25:14.970
It's a double bed with headboard.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.964
I mean, it's even got like
a little headrest and everything.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.646
<i>So, you can understand why someone
came along and thought,</i>

25:20.720 --> 25:22.131
<i>"We can live in these.</i> ”

25:22.200 --> 25:23.201
<i>Fully furnished.</i>

25:23.280 --> 25:26.045
Got a little table there.
Table and chairs there.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.168
You can make a barbecue out of this bit.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.288
A little stove in there.

25:30.640 --> 25:34.406
This one's definitely a bigger size to
me first place in London.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.721
And the mattress we got,
'cause I didn't want to spend that much

25:36.800 --> 25:40.247
on a mattress. It was probably
harder than that, to be honest.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.448
<i>It's nice and green, innit?</i>

25:44.520 --> 25:47.729
<i>When you think about some
of the places people live at home.</i>

25:47.800 --> 25:50.770
<i>All concretey and grey and miserable.</i>

25:50.840 --> 25:53.446
<i>Nice, innit? The atmosphere is nice.</i>

25:54.440 --> 25:56.204
(ROOSTER (ROWING)

25:56.520 --> 25:58.841
It's got a proper kitchen.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.524
And an upstairs.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.082
I mean that's big, innit?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.969
I mean it's marble, that.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.280
That would be a lot of money at home,

26:06.360 --> 26:07.600
to have something like
that in your kitchen.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.524
A marble worktop.
You can do chopping on that.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.887
And you won't cause any damage.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.526
Honestly,

26:16.160 --> 26:17.650
it's good.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.721
- ALL: (CHEERING)

26:30.400 --> 26:31.447
KARL: <i>You live here?</i>

26:31.520 --> 26:32.760
Yeah.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.171
Is it okay to have a look?

26:34.240 --> 26:35.366
Yeah.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.442
Get an idea of what it would be like.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.409
I'll just lie... Lie on the bed?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.448
- Yes.
- Thank you.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.326
Just to have a roof over your head.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.290
It's basic,
but it does the job, doesn't it?

26:51.800 --> 26:55.168
And the thing is, at home, the place
that you always forget to clean,

26:55.240 --> 26:56.287
is under your bed.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.125
They haven't got that problem here,
it's sealed off.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.521
So, no dust and shit and everything.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.161
RICHARD: But what about the plaque
saying, "R.I.P., Rest in Peace?"

27:05.800 --> 27:09.009
Maybe it matters to you.
It doesn't to me.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.085
Are you worried when you've got
your recycling food bin,

27:12.160 --> 27:15.767
when you empty that, because it's full
of chicken bones, bits of bacon,

27:15.840 --> 27:17.524
do you go, (MOANS)

27:17.640 --> 27:20.769
(MOANS) "Is it haunted?
Is the food bin haunted?“

27:20.840 --> 27:22.649
It's a bit of dead chicken.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.165
Treat it the same.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.687
All this, "Don't disturb the dead."
You can't disturb 'em.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.127
Worry about people who have been
disturbed who are living.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.168
I have neighbours who were playing
like the cricket theme tune.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.730

about 3:00 in the morning.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.082
Full. On the stereo. What can you do?

27:43.160 --> 27:46.323
So, don't disturb the living.
Don't disturb the sleeping.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.164
Make a racket all you
want with the dead.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.810
It's not a problem.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.641
So, how does it work then?
How do you get one of these to live in?

28:02.440 --> 28:05.842
And what jobs do people do
in return for getting a home?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.204
KARL: What, take the bodies out?
WOMAN: Yeah.

28:14.880 --> 28:18.248
Urn, yeah, I'll give it a hand, yeah.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.042
How long has the body been in?

28:23.320 --> 28:25.641
So, it won't be manky,
it'll just be skeleton?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.161
Maybe.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.884
Is this a man or a woman?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.484
It's a woman, Mary.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.406
And there's not enough room
for all the dead bodies here,

28:38.480 --> 28:42.201
so you've gotta get 'em
out every five years.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.884
Yeah, I can see like a...
I can see something gold.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.169
It's like a white box
with gold corners on it.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.403
But it doesn't smell, considering
there are dead bodies in there.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.403
That's five years old.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.401
Shit, it's gonna go, innit?

28:58.880 --> 29:01.201
It's just a rotten old coffin.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.845
I can see some hair.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.967
There's some hair.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.326
Aw, shit.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.564
Now, he's got really on it.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.563
That's got a proper head of hair on it.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.483
It's got more hair than me.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.444
It's not grim, it's just like,
it's got a fuckin' hair cut.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.010
KARL: (SIGHS) Look at that.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.487
Jesus.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.121
Got a bra, it's still got a bra on.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.761
(GASPS)

29:25.840 --> 29:28.047
I mean I never saw what
she looked like when she was alive,

29:28.240 --> 29:29.969
yet I saw her bra.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.727
That's weird.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.882
I saw what sort of underwear she wore,

29:34.280 --> 29:36.647
but I know nothing else about her.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.723
If they want them to be
comfy in, like, eternity,

29:41.800 --> 29:43.370
don't leave a bra on her.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.283
Suzanne's always moaning
about wearing a bra.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.850
So, I just go, "It's all right for you,

29:46.920 --> 29:48.365
"you don't have to wear them,
they're well uncomfy."

29:49.000 --> 29:52.322
So, if you're leaving someone
in a box forever, take their bra off.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.410
You know how much a bra is?

29:55.480 --> 29:56.561
RICHARD: I've never bought one.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.244
No, I haven't, but
I've heard Suzanne say,

29:58.320 --> 29:59.321
"Oh, can I have some money for a bra?"

29:59.400 --> 30:00.811
And I thought they were about 6 quid.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.362
30 odd quid for a decent bra,
that's sort of fitting.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.445
Gives a bit of lift. They're not cheap.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.329
And yet there's just one left in there.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.209
Yet, people here have got nothing.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.486
You know, they're quite
poor living here.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.007
There's a dead woman in there
with an half decent bra on.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.445
It doesn't add up.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.291
What's that? That's a hip bone.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.601
RICHARD: Is there much left in there?

30:26.680 --> 30:28.682
No, that's it. It's all gone.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.644
Just one bag like that.
just a bin. What is it?

30:32.720 --> 30:34.529
Yeah, it's a rice bag.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.206
It's got a whole woman in it.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.251
It was just... There she is.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.085
There's Mary, she's been dead
for five years. Get her out.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.565
Stuck her in a bag,

30:46.640 --> 30:50.645
buried the bag, ready for the family
to come and collect it if they want it.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.811
<i>I got a picture from Eric today.</i>

31:05.880 --> 31:07.848
<i>You know the bloke at Crazy Coffins.</i>

31:07.920 --> 31:11.208
You know, who's making
a coffin to look like a Twix.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.321
And so he's getting' on with it.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.845
I don't know, I don't know
if it's the right thing or not,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.048
I don't know,
it was just what came into me head.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.929
When he said, "What do
you want your coffin to be?"

31:23.000 --> 31:24.206
I just fancied a Twix.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.245
RICHARD: Where are you going?

31:55.360 --> 31:59.160
I'm just on me way to a place where they
don't waste land on dead bodies.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.561
That's been my main problem,
hasn't it, with a lot of this.

32:01.640 --> 32:06.043
With burials, it's sort of wasted land
that could be used for something else.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.522
At home, when you buy tomatoes,
they're imported from Spain.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.291
Not 'cause of cost, there isn't
any land to grow anything.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.600
There's no land.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.765
No free land. It's gonna get to a point
when they're sort of growing shit on

32:17.840 --> 32:19.285
football fields.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.967
Old Trafford will be bought to
grow tomatoes and potatoes.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.569
<i>Well, the thing that I'm gonna see now,</i>

32:26.640 --> 32:29.610
<i>they've got a different way
of getting rid of dead bodies.</i>

32:29.680 --> 32:32.445
<i>They stick bodies on the side of cliffs.</i>

32:34.480 --> 32:35.970
So, who's the coffin 'For?

32:37.440 --> 32:38.566
<i>Kaga.</i>

32:43.880 --> 32:46.167
<i>But does he know that you've
made a coffin for him?</i>

32:46.240 --> 32:47.810
<i>This isn't a secret?</i>

32:47.880 --> 32:51.851
He's not like over there not knowing
this is going on. He knows.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.087
Shit. That always happens.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.046
Whenever I paint, bloody fly in it.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.729
That is a blue bottle.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.888
Blue paint all over its arse.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.761
Paint still not bloody dry.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.450
It's heavy.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.490
I know it's like a
bloody wardrobe, though, this.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.210
Quality wardrobe.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.446
So, is this where Kaga wants
to be rested when he's dead?

33:23.520 --> 33:24.965
Yeah. Yeah.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.088
Now, Kaga, he's gonna be
remembered there, isn't he,

33:28.200 --> 33:30.202
in big, bright, blue letters. It's good.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.807
It's good having your name
on it and everything. I like all that.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.803
- Feels like he's in it.
- Yeah.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.928
- It's well heavy.
- (LAUGHS)

33:38.000 --> 33:39.843
RICHARD: Do you reckon you'll
be remembered?

33:40.280 --> 33:41.770
Definitely not.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.286
'Cause no one ever gets me name right.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.442
<i>So they're not gonna remember me.</i>

33:46.520 --> 33:48.363
And the last hotel we were in
struggled again.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.124
I'll show you that.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.883
They got it right there.
Pilkington, they got Pilkington right,

33:54.960 --> 33:56.724
and they stuck a “g"
on the end for no reason.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.926
Pilkingtong.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.970
It's just Like,
there's no need for that.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.443
If I'm remembered, it'll be
Pilkingtong or Pilington or Pickington.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.170
Tilkington, I've got on me council tax.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.321
(PANTING)

34:09.400 --> 34:12.210
Now, it's tricky here.
I'm doing it slowly.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.880
(GRUNTS)

34:14.120 --> 34:15.724
Fuckin' hell.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.606
Hang on.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.047
Right, I'm down. Down, down, down.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.766
Bloody hell.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.002
I think I'll be going
home in one of these.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.286
Yeah.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.286
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

34:31.360 --> 34:32.600
Do we know where we're going with it?

34:32.679 --> 34:35.684
It seems like They can't make up
their mind where they're going with it.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.286
KARL: <i>Is that a coffin?</i>
MAN: <i>Yeah, coffins.</i>

34:38.360 --> 34:40.328
KARL: <i>Coffin in the rock.</i>

34:40.639 --> 34:42.927
It's not in a crack.
It's hanging on the side.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.047
Mmm.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.201
<i>Why?</i>

34:47.400 --> 34:48.686
Did you hear that?

34:48.760 --> 34:50.842
It's mainly so dogs can't get
at the body.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.165
But could you not fit a lock?

35:05.680 --> 35:07.569
Fuckin' hell. I can hardly do it
without the coffin.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.245
No! Shit.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.045
(SIGHS)

35:13.800 --> 35:15.370
Could they not have put it
together down there?

35:15.440 --> 35:17.442
RICHARD: This is how they
usually do it, Karl.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.649
No, 'cause no one's ever suggested.
All it takes is for someone to go,

35:20.720 --> 35:21.801
"You thought about
making it down there?"

35:21.880 --> 35:22.927
And they'll go, "That's a good idea.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.650
"Why has no one ever thought of that?"

35:24.720 --> 35:26.370
It's madness.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.761
I'll tell you there's no way.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.366
If I lived there I wouldn't be
doing this with me granddad.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.680
<i>No way.</i>

35:32.760 --> 35:34.046
I'd ?y tip it.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.408
Honestly. all me family
would be left round here.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.005
Tip it off the edge.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.761
Bloody hell.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.685
Is there bodies in them?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.046
RICHARD: Yeah.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.370
Well, it makes sense
in a way, doesn't it?

35:53.440 --> 35:55.010
I mean, it's not using up land.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.686
That's what I've been
moaning about, innit?

35:58.080 --> 36:00.845
It's just tricky, how do
you get it up there?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.560
Right, you ready?

36:03.640 --> 36:06.291
Hang on. (GRUNTS) Watch your hands.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.769
Hang on a minute. Hang on.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.047
Slow down, me fingers
are stuck in there.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.451
That's it.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.204
Nowhere else to go here.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.805
<i>Yeah, go on, you're ail right.</i>

36:17.880 --> 36:19.370
<i>Where are you going with it?</i>

36:19.440 --> 36:20.601
UP again.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.206
I'm trapped.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.405
Fuckin' hell.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.444
Right, where are you going?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.403
- Right. Down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, down.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.766
MAN: It's okay.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.763
This is bloody barmy, this.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.081
<i>I normally get dizzy
just hanging curtains up.</i>

36:36.880 --> 36:39.486
Esteval, do you know when Kaga dies,

36:39.640 --> 36:41.085
how do they get him up here?

36:42.560 --> 36:43.641
Like this?

36:43.720 --> 36:45.210
What, six fellas and a load of rope?

36:46.480 --> 36:48.209
And you said you do this,

36:48.280 --> 36:50.009
just so dogs can't get at 'em?

36:57.080 --> 37:00.482
I don't believe in any afterlife.

37:01.040 --> 37:04.169
Do you like the idea of having a heaven?

37:04.240 --> 37:05.890
- RICHARD: Yeah.
- And going to it.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.644
RICHARD: I find it comforting.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.488
KARL: I just think it's a lot
of pissin' about.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.642
I mean, it's gonna be crowded
up there now, 'cause the thing is,

37:12.720 --> 37:15.929
there's a lot more people
doing good these days.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.731
When you think about years ago,
you had a lot of evil going on,

37:18.800 --> 37:20.290
King Herod and...

37:20.720 --> 37:23.291
And all that lot.
I can't think of 'em off-hand.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.601
Uh, you know, people cuttin'
off heads and all that.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.330
There was a lot of evil people.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.880
Whereas now, everyone's doing good.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.367
So, it's gonna be checker up there.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.603
When you think about the amount of
people who get involved in Comic Relief,

37:35.680 --> 37:37.284
all them lot, because they've done good,

37:37.360 --> 37:39.647
if the rules are right, you know,
you do good on this planet

37:39.720 --> 37:40.801
and you go off to heaven.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.451
Imagine how many people
are gonna be up there.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.249
Just the people off Comic Relief.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.288
Lenny Henry, he's up there.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.010
Davina McCall.

37:49.160 --> 37:52.721
The bloke who played Doctor Who,
he's always cropping up on Comic Relief.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.529
<i>They're ail at it.</i>

37:54.600 --> 37:56.841
<i>So, in a way, you're better off
headin' wherever the other place is.</i>

37:56.920 --> 37:59.764
If it's hell or wherever. 'Cause it's
gonna be a lot quieter there.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.650
And that's what I like in life.
A bit of peace and quiet.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.803
I've had enough, I just wanna
get down, now. (PANTING)

38:07.080 --> 38:09.082
Can we make our way down?

38:10.440 --> 38:12.204
- Yeah?
- Yes.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.760
RICHARD: What's gain' on?

38:43.840 --> 38:45.251
It's turned up.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.367
What?

38:46.520 --> 38:47.567
Coffin.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.530
It's good.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.928
You'll like it. It's good.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.127
I couldn't keep it at home, basically.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.770
'Cause of the size of it.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.923
Plus, Suzanne, she doesn't want
a coffin in the house.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.367
Which is fair enough, really.
I mean, I didn't think of that.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.729
But, still, it is proper amazing.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.806
RICHARD: It's big.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.370
I know.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.681
That's the only problem with it. It's...

39:19.160 --> 39:21.003
it's fuckin' massive, innit?

39:23.680 --> 39:26.923
It's just little things that
need finishing. It needs hinges on it.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.931
Fuckin' hell.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.889
Look. Perfect.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.722
The idea. Suzanne there.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.849
I don't know if she'd fit in there.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.490
I'm not being rude.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.889
But it is pretty tight for me
and I'm not that fat.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.885
The point is it does the job.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.371
It could catch on if you're close,

39:52.440 --> 39:53.726
and you're a close family
and what have you.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.451
If you got kids, if you got a brother
and a sister, you could have the lot,

39:56.520 --> 39:57.885
and you could be a Kit Kat.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.450
You could have a big bucket.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.851
A big family bucket.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.843
Family bucket. Made for it.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.685
If there's a disaster
and everyone's wiped out.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.205
Again, have a bit of fun with it.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.361
It doesn't have to
be miserable, does it?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.408
Just 'cause the whole family's
been wiped out.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.768
And it's good, I just think about
in like years to come.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.161
You know that Tony Robinson character
who's going around digging shit up.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.880
Imagine that in, like, 200 years,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.082
when the Tony Robinson of the time
digs it up and they go,

40:23.160 --> 40:25.367
"What's this? What's this I've found?"

40:25.440 --> 40:27.363
What's a (STUTTERING) Twix?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.204
Twix probably won't be around.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.281
"What's a Twix?“

40:30.360 --> 40:32.044
"He was this king." And all that.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.561
I don't know. I think it'll be
interesting for future people.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.610
Rather than just another box.
"We dig and we found another box again.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.682
-"Do you know anything about him?"
"Nothing."

40:41.760 --> 40:43.922
<i>Whereas I think this
will get people thinking,</i>

40:44.000 --> 40:45.729
<i>"Why two people in there?"</i>

40:45.880 --> 40:48.531
<i>What is this Twix thing?</i>

40:49.000 --> 40:53.369
Anyway, let's get out of here because
I wanna take you down to Hastings,

40:53.440 --> 40:55.408
show you the other idea
that I've come up with.

40:58.600 --> 41:02.400
<i>I've always been into those
benches you get down by the sea.</i>

41:02.480 --> 41:04.562
And they've got messages
on them, haven't they?

41:04.640 --> 41:07.849
From family, just saying how much
they're gonna miss Elsie who died.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.127
And she used to like
walking along the sea front.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.645
And it's useful.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.441
You've never met Elsie,
but, because of her death,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.809
there's now a chair for you to sit on.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.406
You know, when you're walking along a
sea front on a Bank Holiday Monday.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.008
I don't know what she
was like as a person, Elsie.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.890
She might've been useless, she might
have never done any good in her life.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.042
She might have been
a right lazy old hint.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.487
Right? But when she's died,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.483
she's left something behind.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.688
And I think that's good.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.842
You're dead a lot longer
than you're alive.

41:36.920 --> 41:40.367
So, if you can do something
in that time, that's a good thing.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.442
<i>We've got loads of benches now.</i>

41:48.600 --> 41:51.001
<i>It's not hard to find a seat here.</i>

41:51.080 --> 41:52.730
<i>Well, if you've got any
shit in your pocket,</i>

41:52.800 --> 41:55.087
<i>you don't knew what to do with it,
there's never enough bins.</i>

41:55.160 --> 41:57.925
So, I'm taking the same idea
as the bench thing,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.971
and putting messages on bins,
like a memorial bin.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.050
It's this one.

42:11.880 --> 42:12.961
Look at that.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.844
RICHARD: What's it say?

42:14.960 --> 42:18.407
In memory of Madame Comfort Cofie.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.720
It's Comfort who I met in Ghana.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.009
Well, I never met her, did I?
I only ever met her when she was dead.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.484
But a little old memory of her
stuck on a bin.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.646
I think it's good.

42:28.720 --> 42:33.123
Honestly, I'm not messing about here,
this isn't like a little daft gimmick,

42:33.240 --> 42:34.241
for a programme.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.527
I think this could catch on.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.090
We're not just talking
about this bin was here

42:38.160 --> 42:39.525
and we stuck a plaque on it.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.729
People buy a bin. They buy the full bin.
That's what you buy.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.246
Someone dies, you don't know what
to do to remember them.

42:45.320 --> 42:48.324
You buy the bin and have
the plaque made and stuck on.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.371
So, before Comfort died,
there would have been more shit here.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.520
So, imagine if more people did this.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.850
Could have got a bit of a better photo.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.570
It's a bit moody.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.922
