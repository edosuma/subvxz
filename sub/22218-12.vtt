<i>male announcer: On the last</i>
<i>episode of "Ink Master,"</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:07.757
<i>eight masters and apprentices</i>
<i>were battling it out</i>

00:07.841 --> 00:10.635
<i>to prove</i>
<i>they're the best.</i>

00:10.719 --> 00:12.929
- At what point do you think
that if I don't knock you out

00:13.012 --> 00:15.473
{\an1}that I have a clear [bleep]
into the finals?

00:15.557 --> 00:17.475
- Let's make it a [bleep]
goddamn death match.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.435
- That's the goal.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.228

00:20.311 --> 00:23.148

00:23.231 --> 00:24.941
<i>- Chris may have</i>
<i>a hard time today</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:27.652
with these little micro tattoos
with those big, stumpy fingers.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.695
- Chris and I have a plan.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.947
- But do you think he
really has your back?

00:31.030 --> 00:33.658
<i>announcer:</i>
<i>In the elimination tattoo,</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:36.327
<i>Tyler was out for revenge.</i>

00:36.411 --> 00:37.287
- Here, that's you.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.455
<i>Matt pretty much</i>
<i>told me</i>

00:38.538 --> 00:40.457
<i>that Chris said</i>
<i>I'm [bleep] disposable.</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:42.459
[bleep] you, dude.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.794
- Let's just go at them,
our team against their team.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.962
{\an1}I'm not gonna take somebody
calling me

00:46.045 --> 00:46.963
a two-faced [bleep] liar.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.465
{\an3}- You're campaigning
to these people

00:48.548 --> 00:50.842
{\an3}to do your bidding to work
your personal way to the top.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.303
{\an1}- You have no idea
how ridiculous you sound.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.888
- We all [bleep]
know it, Chris.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.431
<i>announcer:</i>
<i>In the elimination,</i>

00:56.514 --> 00:58.850
<i>Kruseman, Katie,</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:01.311
<i>and Matt</i>
<i>were the bottom three.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:05.940
{\an8}<i>- Kruseman, there's nothing</i>
<i>consistent about the sky.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:06.900
{\an1}- Omitting that flow
the way it is in the painting

01:06.983 --> 01:09.652
{\an1}is a choice that puts you
in the bottom.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.653
<i>- Matt.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:11.988
<i>- Biggest problem</i>
<i>for me is the face.</i>

01:12.071 --> 01:13.323
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>Wilma Flintstone.</i>

If there's one thing
you're gonna get right,

01:14.616 --> 01:15.742
<i>that would be the thing</i>
<i>to get right.</i>

01:15.825 --> 01:17.243
<i>- Katie.</i>
<i>it's very difficult</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:18.995
to identify this
as being a famous painting.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.456
{\an3}- I deserve a place
in the finale.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.916
I'm a badass bitch.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.334
- Katie,

01:24.417 --> 01:27.629
you do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.468
<i>announcer:</i>
<i>Seven artists remain,</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:38.515

02:39.659 --> 02:41.911

02:41.995 --> 02:42.328

- I'm [bleep] bummed.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.093
{\an1}I'm not at all stoked
right now.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.303
{\an8}- Mission accomplished.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.013
<i>Now that Katie's gone,</i>
<i>Matt is weak,</i>

03:00.096 --> 03:01.472

03:01.556 --> 03:06.269
- Where are you in this whole
Chris and Tyler movement?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.937
- Their movement?
- Their team.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.480

<i>and with Katie gone,</i>
<i>if I can get him on my side,</i>

03:16.654 --> 03:18.323
it's gonna be
to my benefit.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.949
{\an3}I just see you as being
one of the stronger artists,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.619
{\an3}<i>and if we partner</i>
<i>in this,</i>

03:22.702 --> 03:25.788
{\an3}we could actually use that
to help us.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.972
- Welcome.
The seven of you have

03:43.056 --> 03:45.600
laid it all on the line,
but the toughest battles

03:45.683 --> 03:47.810
are yet to come,
because only one of you

03:47.894 --> 03:52.482
will walk away with $100,000,
a feature in "Inked" Magazine,

03:52.565 --> 03:54.859
and the title
of Ink Master.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.905
This week we're testing
your ability to use finesse.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.407
- Finesse.
- [bleep].

04:01.491 --> 04:03.493
{\an8}- Finesse is used in two
different ways with tattooing.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.036
<i>First, it's just</i>
<i>dealing with the canvas,</i>

04:05.119 --> 04:07.330
and the second part is
doing the actual tattoo.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.083
<i>- You must be able to handle</i>
<i>complex tattoos,</i>

04:10.166 --> 04:12.001
difficult placement,
and dealing

04:12.085 --> 04:14.420
with your canvas's needs
with delicacy and ease.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.882
<i>Today you must each work</i>
<i>with a guest artist</i>

04:17.966 --> 04:19.550
and tattoo their design.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.969
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
<i>Tattooing other people's art</i>

04:21.052 --> 04:23.346
{\an8}can sometimes be
a nightmare.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.348
<i>Sometimes you're stuck</i>
<i>doing a bad tattoo.</i>

04:25.431 --> 04:28.267
- Let's meet your guest artists
and your canvases.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.736
Hi, guys.
all: Hi.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.699
- Welcome. Thank you so much
for being here.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.661
Approximately 400,000 Americans
have Down Syndrome.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.038
<i>Down Syndrome is</i>
<i>the most commonly occurring</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:50.373
<i>chromosomal condition</i>
<i>that occurs</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:54.585
when a person has
an extra copy of chromosome 21.

04:54.669 --> 04:58.298
<i>Individuals with Down Syndrome</i>
<i>experience cognitive delays,</i>

04:58.381 --> 05:00.883
but the effect
is usually mild to moderate

05:00.967 --> 05:02.218
and is not an indicator
of the many strengths

05:02.301 --> 05:05.138
and talents
each individual possesses.

05:05.221 --> 05:09.267
For some,
art is one of those talents.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.894
<i>Each of today's guest artists</i>
<i>with Down Syndrome</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:13.563
<i>has brought a loved one</i>
<i>with them</i>

05:13.646 --> 05:17.150
<i>who wants their artwork</i>
<i>tattooed on them forever.</i>

05:17.233 --> 05:20.361
<i>Please tell us</i>
<i>why you're here today.</i>

05:20.445 --> 05:21.696
{\an3}- This is
my brother-in-law Joe.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.948
{\an3}I'm here to get a tattoo
of the sign language symbol

05:24.032 --> 05:25.158
{\an3}for "I love you,"
to show

05:25.241 --> 05:26.993
{\an3}the positive impact
Joe's had in my life.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.455
{\an3}- This is my brother Matt.
I'm having him design a tattoo

05:30.538 --> 05:32.665
{\an3}to mark the relationship
that we have.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.919
{\an3}- Apparently
a thunderstorm.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.756
{\an3}- This is my daughter Nicole.
She's been my inspiration

05:39.839 --> 05:41.257
{\an3}and driving force
since the day she was born.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.260
{\an3}- I'm so proud
of my daughter Marissa

05:44.343 --> 05:46.471
{\an3}and all that
she's accomplished,

05:46.554 --> 05:47.972
and I can't wait
to have a tattoo

05:48.056 --> 05:49.766
{\an3}with her
amazing artwork.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.975
{\an3}<i>- This is my brother</i>
<i>Patrick,</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:52.935
and I'm here to get
a meaningful tattoo.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.729
{\an3}<i>And I also want people</i>
<i>to ask me about it</i>

05:54.812 --> 05:55.730
{\an3}<i>because I want</i>
<i>there to be</i>

05:55.813 --> 05:57.648
{\an3}a conversation
about Down Syndrome,

05:57.732 --> 05:59.567
{\an3}and I think that this tattoo
is the perfect way to do that.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.446
{\an3}- This is my sister
Stephanie.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.447
<i>She's a artist</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

06:04.530 --> 06:06.449
{\an3}I want to get a tattoo
of her artwork on me

06:06.532 --> 06:09.368
{\an3}to show that I really
believe in her as an artist.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.789
{\an3}- This is my son Jay,
and I'm here today for him.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.207
{\an3}He said it was
his wish come true.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.126
- Guys, you're
the last seven artists here,

06:17.210 --> 06:18.127
<i>and we put these canvases</i>
<i>in your hands</i>

06:18.211 --> 06:20.880
because we respect
your artwork

06:20.963 --> 06:23.049
<i>and the ability to translate</i>
<i>that to these guys.</i>

06:23.132 --> 06:24.425
Do not let us down
on that.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.011
<i>This is it, this is</i>
<i>family pride right here.</i>

06:27.095 --> 06:29.138
- You can guide,
make suggestions,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.224
<i>and work</i>
<i>with the guest artists,</i>

06:31.307 --> 06:33.559
but you cannot draw
their designs for them.

06:33.643 --> 06:38.314
<i>One by one, please choose</i>
<i>a skull to determine the artist</i>

06:38.397 --> 06:40.942
<i>that you must collaborate</i>
<i>with on your tattoo.</i>

06:41.025 --> 06:43.111
Go ahead.

06:44.028 --> 06:44.946
- [laughs]

06:45.029 --> 06:46.114
- Chris.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.407
- Tyler?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.035
- Erik.
- Erik.

06:52.453 --> 06:52.537
- Duffy.

06:55.373 --> 06:55.456
- Matt.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.876
- Kruseman.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.671
- Craig.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.964
- Yes!

07:03.047 --> 07:04.423
- He's a fan of Craig.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.842
<i>- There's times</i>
<i>where you question,</i>

07:05.925 --> 07:07.510
{\an8}"Are we really doing something
that somebody

07:07.593 --> 07:09.387
{\an8}really wants to have
for the rest of their life?"

07:09.470 --> 07:11.139
<i>This is one of those moments</i>

07:11.222 --> 07:12.265
that you don't even
have to ask any questions.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.517
<i>This is why</i>
<i>I'm a tattoo artist.</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:16.644
I just want to do
something really special.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.688
- The winner of the flash
challenge will have the power

07:18.771 --> 07:22.733
<i>to assign all human canvases</i>
<i>in the elimination tattoo.</i>

07:22.817 --> 07:24.193
<i>You have four hours</i>
<i>to show finesse,</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:27.738
and your time starts now.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.783
- Marissa, how are you?
- Good, good. -

07:30.867 --> 07:31.617
{\an1}- Let's have a seat
and figure out

07:31.701 --> 07:33.452
what we're gonna do.
- Let's do it.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.745
{\an1}- Should I just give you
some paper and let you go crazy?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.497
{\an3}- Yeah.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.373
<i>- There's a lot more at stake</i>
<i>today in this challenge.</i>

07:37.456 --> 07:39.500
<i>It's giving</i>
<i>these guest artists</i>

07:39.584 --> 07:40.543
<i>a chance to be part</i>
<i>of something amazing,</i>

07:40.626 --> 07:42.628
<i>and it's giving</i>
<i>their loved ones a gift</i>

07:42.712 --> 07:44.297
<i>that they can take with them</i>
<i>the rest of their life</i>

07:44.380 --> 07:46.632
{\an8}to show the connection
they have.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.384
<i>- So I was thinking</i>
<i>of a treasure chest.</i>

07:48.467 --> 07:49.927
{\an1}<i>She's having</i>
<i>a really hard time</i>

07:50.011 --> 07:51.220
{\an1}<i>sketching</i>
<i>out the treasure chest.</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:53.264
- Okay.
<i>- Yeah. It's hard for me</i>

07:53.347 --> 07:54.515
to sketch it out.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.142
{\an3}- I can kind of give you
some ideas...

07:56.225 --> 07:57.476
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- And show you

07:57.560 --> 07:58.644
{\an3}kind of how I would draw
something like that.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.521
<i>- This challenge is gonna take</i>
<i>a lot of finesse,</i>

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
dealing with these guest artists
to explain to them

08:03.608 --> 08:04.400
what can be done
as a tattoo

08:04.483 --> 08:06.777
and make them
a part of the process.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.570
- When life hits you...
- Mm-hmm

08:07.653 --> 08:09.739
- He can always
make me smile,

08:09.822 --> 08:12.408
so to have incorporated
some smiley face--

08:12.491 --> 08:15.828
- Between the two of you,
this'll be awesome.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.080
{\an8}- You're welcome.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.750
- You and I.
- Yeah.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.461
- We're gonna do it, right?
- Okay, great.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.545
- You can do whatever you want.
- Okay.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.756
- I'm already
into this kind of stuff.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.090
You know what I mean?
It's cool.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.258
- Good.
- All right, you're good.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.593
- Yes, I'm fine.
- [laughs]

08:30.676 --> 08:31.594
<i>- The meaning behind this</i>
<i>is so deep.</i>

08:31.677 --> 08:34.179
{\an8}Blood is definitely
thicker than water.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.725
{\an1}The black tattoo ink in these
is actually my brother's ashes.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.976
- That's amazing.
- When he passed away,

08:39.059 --> 08:40.895
{\an1}we took his ashes,
and I got tattooed with 'em.

08:40.977 --> 08:41.770
This way he will
always be a part of me

08:41.854 --> 08:43.648
and go everywhere with me,
you know?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.024
<i>- That's beautiful, man.</i>
- And I feel like that's

08:45.107 --> 08:46.567
powerful like what's
going on here today.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.902
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- This is so cool.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.695
- Perfect.
- I like it.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.615
- My favorite part of your
elephant is his big smile.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.533
<i>Patrick definitely</i>
<i>came in with a plan.</i>

08:54.617 --> 08:56.869
{\an1}- He told me he was gonna
design me a tattoo

08:56.953 --> 08:57.787
that will get me
a good boyfriend.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.872
{\an3}- Trying to get your sister
a date?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.124
- Yes.
[both laughing]

09:02.208 --> 09:04.502
{\an8}- Being away from my baby is
the hardest part of being here,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.964
but it is amazing
to be a part of this challenge.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.717
{\an7}- I'm gonna cry, yeah.
He's convinced I'm gonna cry.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.221
<i>- Doing a great job, Joe.</i>
<i>It looks great.</i>

09:18.808 --> 09:20.101
{\an9}- Okay.
[laughs]

09:20.184 --> 09:21.978
{\an8}Go for it, Joe, man.
Paint me something good.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.189
{\an3}- 50--50 percent sure
that we might win.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.150
- We've won a lot already,
so we have a good chance.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.027
- With your treasure chest,

09:30.111 --> 09:33.781
<i>the top of it, just do</i>
<i>a little half circle up here.</i>

09:33.864 --> 09:35.491
- Now it looks like it opens.
- Yeah.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.994
- Marissa, that's awesome.
- That's awesome.

09:38.077 --> 09:38.494
That's totally--
- Thank you.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.121
- Yeah, totally.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.415
- Three hours to go,
three more hours.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.791
- This.
- Okay.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.167
- Carefully put it on her
like that.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.836
<i>- Peel it back.</i>
- Steady.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.171
- Yeah. Look at that.
- Very good, steady.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.674
- Yeah, it's good.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.846
{\an1}- You are not using
the needle.

09:56.929 --> 09:57.888
- Oh, yes.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.973
{\an1}- Oh, no.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.516
- Oh, yes.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.768
{\an8}- This kid is so happy
that I'm working with him.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.437
{\an1}You can turn it
on and off, though.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.480
- Yes!
- That you--that you could do.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.356
{\an3}- You're a little too eager
to inflict pain upon me.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.650
{\an3}I don't know
how I feel about that.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.568
- [laughs]

10:10.651 --> 10:12.361
- I look like a [bleep]
crazy person.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.281
I'm the guy who's got "666"
tattooed on him, pentagrams,

10:15.364 --> 10:17.533
and he just looks
right past that [bleep],

10:17.616 --> 10:19.785
and just to be around people
that have

10:19.869 --> 10:21.579
just unconditional love
for everybody

10:21.662 --> 10:23.873
is [bleep], like,
worth everything.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.916
So check this out, man.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.753
{\an9}- I won't freak out,
Matt.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.758
- I like it.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.510
{\an1}- I like it too.
I think we did a good job.

10:38.179 --> 10:43.267
<i>- Five, four, three,</i>
<i>two, one.</i>

10:43.351 --> 10:47.396
That is it, time's up.
Machines down, no more ink.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.065
- We did good, huh?
- Yeah.

10:49.148 --> 10:49.440
- Your artwork was awesome.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.193
- [laughs]

10:52.276 --> 10:54.236
Just like something
he would do.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.029
{\an1}- Thank you
for hanging out today.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.822
Can I give you a hug?
- Yeah.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.991
- Oh, my God!
- [laughs]

10:59.075 --> 11:00.326
That is awesome!

11:00.409 --> 11:02.411
- I like it.
<i>- Good job.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:03.621
- Thank you.
- Winners.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.414
{\an3}- Yes.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.208
{\an1}- All right, guys.
Time to critique your work.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.585
{\an1}First artist up
is Chris.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.797
Joe, how did Chris do
in terms of translating

11:12.880 --> 11:14.757
your work
onto the skin?

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
- He was incredible,

11:15.925 --> 11:18.719
{\an1}so for that,
I hope he's the winner.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.929
- [laughs]

11:20.012 --> 11:21.597
<i>I like this tattoo</i>
<i>because the use of color</i>

11:21.680 --> 11:24.058
<i>really looks</i>
<i>like a watercolor field.</i>

11:24.141 --> 11:26.352
- Amazing design.
Love what you did.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.645
<i>- Wow. You never hear that</i>
<i>out of Chris Nuñez.</i>

11:27.728 --> 11:28.145
- Yay!
- [laughs]

11:28.229 --> 11:30.398
- Home runner!

11:30.481 --> 11:32.233
<i>- Next artist up</i>
<i>is Tyler.</i>

11:33.692 --> 11:35.111
- What do you think?
Does this look like your art?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.362
- Yes, it is.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.614
{\an3}<i>- I really love the storm</i>
<i>to the rainbow coming down.</i>

11:38.697 --> 11:41.409
{\an3}<i>I think that the colors</i>
<i>you used in here</i>

11:41.492 --> 11:43.119
are really strong
and really nice.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.245
- This is kind of cool.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.788
-<i> Tattoos like this</i>
<i>are so amazing,</i>

11:45.871 --> 11:48.082
<i>because it's just as much</i>
<i>about the meaning</i>

11:48.165 --> 11:51.127
as it is about the art.
I think it's priceless.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.253
<i>- Next artist up is Erik.</i>

11:52.336 --> 11:53.671
- How many different drawings
did y'all work from

11:53.754 --> 11:55.798
to get this drawing
to come down?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.466
- I had her draw
a couple for me.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.468
<i>We kind of pieced them together</i>
<i>to collaborate.</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:01.846
-<i> Looks like it came together</i>
<i>well as a good composition.</i>

12:01.929 --> 12:05.975
{\an1}- Bujie, her guardian angel,
was our 11-year-old Akita

12:06.058 --> 12:07.560
{\an1}that we just had to put down
a couple of weeks ago.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.644
- Aw.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.979
<i>You know what I like</i>
<i>is that you took</i>

12:10.062 --> 12:11.439
<i>something sad</i>
<i>in your life,</i>

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
<i>and you made something</i>
<i>beautiful out of it.</i>

12:13.232 --> 12:13.524
- I think you did
a great job.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.443
- Thank you.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.112
- Next up is Duffy.
How was it working with Duffy?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.739
- Were you looking
over her shoulder

12:20.823 --> 12:21.490
{\an3}the whole time to make sure
she didn't screw it up?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.159
- Yes.
<i>- All right, good.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:24.577
<i>[laughter]</i>

12:24.660 --> 12:26.078
<i>Well, I think it came out</i>
<i>very strong.</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:27.872
<i>It's a very fun,</i>
<i>playful tattoo.</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:28.789
<i>Obviously, the teamwork</i>
<i>came out strong,</i>

12:28.873 --> 12:31.333
'cause everybody's happy,
so good job.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.628
- Next artist up is Matt.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.173
So, Marissa,
how was it working with Matt?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.386
- Did you coach her in any way?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.679
<i>- I showed her a new way</i>
<i>to draw the treasure chest</i>

12:43.762 --> 12:45.806
<i>so that it had</i>
<i>a little bit more of</i>

12:45.890 --> 12:47.349
the three-dimensional look
to it.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.851
<i>- Nice.</i>
- Other than that,

12:48.934 --> 12:49.852
<i>she really took it from there.</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:50.853
<i>- Everything looks beautiful.</i>

12:50.936 --> 12:52.188
<i>The design's beautiful.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:53.647
<i>What Matt taught you,</i>

12:53.731 --> 12:56.233
<i>you can start using that moving</i>
<i>forward in your art direction.</i>

12:56.317 --> 12:58.527
You did really great work.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.946
<i>- Next up is Kruseman.</i>
<i>Stephanie,</i>

13:01.030 --> 13:03.699
I understand that you're
an artist in your own right.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.242
<i>You've had some shows.</i>
- She did a whole bunch

13:05.326 --> 13:08.704
of sketches of the most amazing
Picasso-esque style artwork.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.915
<i>- You show off a lot</i>
<i>of natural skills</i>

13:10.998 --> 13:13.083
that people
try to emulate all the time.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.212
<i>- It does have</i>
<i>that Picasso-esque feel to it.</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:18.506
- Kruseman, this has got
to be one for the books, right?

13:18.589 --> 13:22.051
- It's a emotional day,

13:22.134 --> 13:24.303
and I'm stoked to be here.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.765
- Craig and Jay.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.643
So, Jay,
when you picked your skull

13:30.726 --> 13:32.269
and you saw
Craig was your artist,

13:32.353 --> 13:33.896
you seemed very happy
about that.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.105
- My friend.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.857
My guy.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.317
<i>- He's your guy?</i>
- My guy.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.736
- Did you tell Craig
you wanted bright colors?

13:40.819 --> 13:42.071
<i>It's a really bright tattoo.</i>

13:42.154 --> 13:43.572
<i>I think it stands out.</i>

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
<i>I love the little details</i>
<i>in the faces and the fingers.</i>

13:45.491 --> 13:47.535
<i>I think it's very cool.</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:48.661
Good job.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.247
[laughter]

13:51.330 --> 13:53.916
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.335
- Awesome.

13:56.418 --> 13:59.213
- You must tattoo some of the
most delicate skin on the body.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.840
<i>- Oh, my Lord.</i>

14:01.924 --> 14:04.009
- I've had so many people
tell me not to do this today,

14:04.093 --> 14:04.843
but go big or go home.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.227
- All right, guys.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.853
We're testing finesse
by having artists

14:14.937 --> 14:17.606
with Down Syndrome design
tattoos for their loved ones.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.359
- I think it was great
to see Craig do a tattoo

14:20.442 --> 14:21.527
<i>with a lot</i>
<i>of bright colors in it.</i>

14:21.610 --> 14:24.154
<i>I wish we could see</i>
<i>more of this color saturation</i>

14:24.238 --> 14:26.949
in Craig's tattoos
when it's up to his own devices.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.576
<i>- Kruseman worked</i>
<i>with Stephanie.</i>

14:28.659 --> 14:29.702
<i>- Man, he was welled up,</i>

14:29.785 --> 14:31.453
<i>and that tattoo was flawless.</i>

14:31.537 --> 14:33.247
- The story that unfolded
with Matt and Marissa

14:33.330 --> 14:34.623
<i>was really cool</i>
<i>how he didn't draw it for her.</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:36.125
<i>He showed her some examples,</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:39.128
<i>and she walked away learning</i>
<i>a little bit more today</i>

14:39.211 --> 14:40.629
<i>about the artistic side</i>
<i>of things.</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:41.755
- All these artists
showed great finesse today.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.133
This is gonna be hard
to pick a win.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.426
- I'm torn in seven directions.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.386
- Nobody walks out a loser,
tattooer,

14:47.469 --> 14:48.929
guest artist, or the canvases.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.972
- We're gonna
have to figure this out.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.433
- Let's do it.
- All right.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.226
- Today you had to show finesse

14:54.310 --> 14:57.187
by collaborating with a guest
artist with Down Syndrome

14:57.271 --> 14:59.815
<i>to create a tattoo</i>
<i>that expresses their vision.</i>

14:59.898 --> 15:01.609
Every artist here
did inspiring work.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.819
- This is the thing you go home

15:03.902 --> 15:05.904
and remember because you
can do a dragon back piece.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.489
You can do a big chest eagle.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.116
{\an3}It's cool today,
but you forgot about it

15:09.199 --> 15:10.534
{\an3}<i>next week 'cause</i>
<i>you're on to the next thing.</i>

15:10.618 --> 15:11.744
<i>This is something you remember,</i>

15:11.827 --> 15:13.329
and you guys
were all professionals,

15:13.412 --> 15:14.496
and you did a great job.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.456
<i>- It's a lifelong impact,</i>
<i>really.</i>

15:15.539 --> 15:17.708
Not just a one-day smile.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.044
<i>- All seven of you</i>
<i>showed incredible finesse,</i>

15:20.127 --> 15:23.881
and for that reason it's
impossible to pick a winner.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.215
All seven of you won,

15:25.299 --> 15:27.509
and all seven
of our guest artists won.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.428
{\an8}- I think the judges
made the right call.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.888
<i>It's so hard to pick a winner</i>

15:30.971 --> 15:32.181
when all these tattoos
were so cool.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.809
- In light of that, we've had
to change the playing field

15:35.893 --> 15:37.853
a little bit here,
so to my right are seven skulls,

15:37.936 --> 15:41.523
and on the bottom
of one of the skulls is an X.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.567
<i>One by one,</i>
<i>you will each draw a skull.</i>

15:43.651 --> 15:46.028
<i>The artist that picks the X</i>
<i>will have the power</i>

15:46.111 --> 15:46.779
<i>to assign all</i>
<i>the human canvases</i>

15:46.862 --> 15:49.615
<i>for the elimination tattoo.</i>

15:49.698 --> 15:50.699
- Okay.
- Wow.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.701
- I think that's
a fair move here.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.577
- It's pretty fair.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.954
- Erik, come on up.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.209
{\an8}- This is a random skull pick,

16:00.292 --> 16:03.504
{\an8}so I can only hope that the
tattoo gods are with me today.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.719
- Kruseman.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.099
<i>Duffy.</i>

16:15.182 --> 16:18.519
Tyler.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.688
Erik.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.981
- And Bingo was his name-o.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
<i>- And there it is.</i>

16:24.483 --> 16:26.652
Erik, you will have the power
to assign all human canvases

16:26.735 --> 16:29.321
for the elimination tattoo.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.573
- I don't know if this is
a bad thing or a good thing.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.991
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what Erik's deal is.</i>

16:33.075 --> 16:34.076
You never know what he's got
up his sleeve.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.162
- Head back to the loft
and prepare for the next

16:37.246 --> 16:39.957
elimination tattoo.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.044
- Erik, I don't think
me and Tyler have any intention

16:44.128 --> 16:45.421
of going after you,

16:45.504 --> 16:46.672
but we kind of need to discuss
whether or not you want to try

16:46.755 --> 16:49.383
to work together as a team.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.928
- My concern with it is that it
makes me an immediate target.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.513
{\an8}Chris is definitely an asshole,

16:54.596 --> 16:56.598
<i>and everyone here is rooting</i>
<i>for him to go home.</i>

16:56.682 --> 16:59.268
But I don't want to do anything
to create enemies.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.894
- We're to the point now,
with seven people,

17:00.978 --> 17:03.188
everybody's gonna get targeted.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.481

ornate, lost it in the outline,

34:35.572 --> 34:37.992
and then had to go in and hide
a bunch of mistakes.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.702
- But in six months,
Chris's is gonna look the worst.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.330

34:45.208 --> 34:47.001
The white is definitely
not there.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.127
- It's rough.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.004
- It's gonna
be super interesting

34:50.087 --> 34:52.340
to see who the human canvas jury
votes to the bottom.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.674
- Absolutely.

34:54.967 --> 34:58.471
- We're here to determine who
has the worst tattoo of the day.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.348
- That's my tattoo,
and Craig is my artist.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.558
<i>- I think his lines are harsh</i>
<i>all along the bottom</i>

35:02.642 --> 35:03.684
<i>and above all the gems.</i>

35:03.768 --> 35:04.936
<i>The lines are very, very shaky,</i>

35:05.019 --> 35:06.229
and they're uneven.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.522
<i>- The cross kind of</i>
<i>doesn't go with it.</i>

35:07.605 --> 35:09.065
- Really?
<i>- 'Cause everything else</i>

35:09.148 --> 35:11.484
looks so dimensional,
and then that's, like, flat.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.236
- Do you think
he should be at the bottom?

35:13.319 --> 35:14.946
- I think he should win,
actually.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.824
- That's a little exaggerated.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.991
- That's my tattoo,

35:19.075 --> 35:21.035
and my artist was Matt.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.328
I am upset that it's so dark.

35:22.411 --> 35:26.207
<i>- It doesn't help that the line</i>
<i>at the top is so solid.</i>

35:26.290 --> 35:27.291
It's just like...
[choking]

35:27.375 --> 35:32.338

either sheer or see-through.

35:32.421 --> 35:32.713
- You can fix it.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.341
- Laser.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.094
That is my tattoo,
and my artist was Kruseman.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.303
<i>- What is the white hole?</i>

35:39.387 --> 35:41.514

35:41.597 --> 35:43.224
<i>He didn't seem like</i>
<i>he wanted to do it.</i>

35:43.307 --> 35:45.101
He just figured
that he would just make a hole.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.727
- He played it safe.
- He did, he really did.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.271
- That--that's
what he was doing.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.273
<i>- I just think he copped out.</i>
- I'd be upset with your tattoo

35:50.356 --> 35:51.399

- Right.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.441

with it.

the other tattoos we saw today.

And one thing
that bothers me about Matt's,

38:36.689 --> 38:38.274
more than anything else, is
that putting it in a weird place

38:38.357 --> 38:41.110
on the body
where it doesn't fit,

38:41.193 --> 38:44.905
to me, is a bigger travesty
than making something fit right

38:44.989 --> 38:45.906

to do some touchups.
