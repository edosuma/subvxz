WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:09.748
Previously onDynasty...[groans]

00:09.792 --> 00:11.402
Dr. Bailey, you've had it out
for me ever since

00:11.446 --> 00:14.014
I turned down your advances
my first week on the job.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.145
I resent that accusation.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.799
I was just afraid that

00:16.842 --> 00:18.105
me on a screen
wouldn't be enough

00:18.148 --> 00:19.236
to keep you interested.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.890
Well, here I am.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.109
Talking to that guy yesterday,

00:22.152 --> 00:23.632
helping him find his faith--

00:23.675 --> 00:26.026
it made me think
how much I'm gonna miss that.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.419
I can't keep you
from your calling.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.334
You know, I could use
someone with experience,

00:30.378 --> 00:31.640
someone I trust.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.685
The answer is "yes."
Father and daughter

00:33.729 --> 00:35.426
side by side,
building an empire.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.396
Well, I can't go in today.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.093
I have nothing to wear.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.227
You have more clothes
and shoes than Imelda Marcos.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.055
Well, I don't know who that is,

00:55.098 --> 00:57.927
but if we wear the same size,
I would love to raid her closet.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.537
What you have on looks great.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.670
Though it would look even better
if you took it off,

01:01.713 --> 01:03.715
if you know what I mean.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.282
This is what I wear
to brush my teeth.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.805
It's getting demoted
to loungewear,

01:06.849 --> 01:08.546
effective immediately.

01:08.590 --> 01:12.115
Okay, look, I know
that Blake starts

01:12.159 --> 01:13.551
at Fallon Unlimited today,

01:13.595 --> 01:16.076
but I-I don't really get
all of this.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.382
The last thing I need
on Blake's first day is

01:18.426 --> 01:20.819
to be out-power-suited by him.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.256
I need to look bossy.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.779
♪ Suddenly I see

01:23.822 --> 01:25.563
♪ Suddenly I see♪

01:25.607 --> 01:27.261
♪ This is what I wanna be

01:27.304 --> 01:31.700
♪ Suddenly I see ♪ Suddenly I see♪

01:31.743 --> 01:32.962
♪ Why the hell
it means so much to me ♪

01:33.005 --> 01:34.877
♪ Suddenly I see♪

01:34.920 --> 01:36.879
♪ Yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah

01:38.750 --> 01:41.579
♪ Why the hell it means
so much to me. ♪

01:41.623 --> 01:45.583
Perfect. Though I really
think you're overreacting.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.063
I think I'm underreacting.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.545
And deep down, Blake still
doesn't take me seriously.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.068
Blake needs you.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.809
Okay, he has
nothing to

01:53.852 --> 01:55.115
his name but his name.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.986
And if he starts to
frustrate you, just

01:57.029 --> 01:59.162
count to five in Spanish
before you react.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.034
It's a relaxation technique.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.427
It's how I got
through the summer

02:03.471 --> 02:04.950
my mother experimented
with her meds.

02:04.994 --> 02:09.085
Oh, it's, uh,
it's that sweatshirt again?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.087
What? What's wrong
with my writing sweatshirt?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.176
Karl Lagerfeld once said

02:13.220 --> 02:15.091
"Sweats are a sign of defeat."

02:15.135 --> 02:17.093
Okay, well, I don't
know who that is,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.921
but if he wants to write
the first two chapters

02:18.964 --> 02:20.923
for my publisher, he's
more than welcome to.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.968
Oh, well, I doubt it,

02:23.012 --> 02:25.188
considering
he's no longer alive.Mm.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.234
I guess we both have
work to do.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.107
Hey, just remember,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.891
he may be your father,

02:32.935 --> 02:34.632
but you're the boss.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.504
BLAKE:
She may be the boss,

02:36.547 --> 02:38.506
but I'm her father.

02:38.549 --> 02:41.813
I'm impressed at how you managed
to put your ego aside

02:41.857 --> 02:43.685
to work for Fallon.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.077
I'm not putting anything aside.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.123
Fallon needs me to get
her new business on track.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.170
And this job is just
a stepping-stone.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.867
To anywhere
in particular?

02:51.910 --> 02:55.131
Yeah, back to the top
of my own company.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.568
And then, we will
be out of here.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.962
Nothing would
make me happier, sir.

03:00.005 --> 03:03.052
You haven't lived
in quarters this small

03:03.095 --> 03:05.533
since we sailed Freedom
to Anguilla. [chuckles]

03:05.576 --> 03:08.144
Any further news
about Father Caleb?

03:08.188 --> 03:12.583
Yeah, he's back to preaching
to his flock for good.

03:12.627 --> 03:16.979
While I am meeting Cristal
tonight for drinks.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.156
See?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.680
God always has a plan.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.726
Or at least I do.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.077
I know you're excited
about going back to work,

03:28.120 --> 03:30.079
but promise me you're
gonna listen to your body.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.908
If you feel tired, or
experience any pain,

03:32.951 --> 03:34.475
you tell Sam, and you
come home, all right?

03:34.518 --> 03:36.955
Are you going to write me
a doctor's note?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.653
Just because your stab wound
looks healed doesn't mean

03:38.696 --> 03:39.958
you can go back
to the same level

03:40.002 --> 03:41.438
of physical activity as before.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.440
I'm not a delicate flower.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.182
And I can think of some
other physical activity

03:46.226 --> 03:47.662
I'd like to get back to,
seeing as

03:47.705 --> 03:49.968
you fell asleep last night
reading patient charts.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.274
[sighs]
I know. I... I'm sorry.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.189
I've been super focused
on work right now.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.237
Well, maybe later,
you can be super focused on me.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.806
Oh. You late for your speed
walkers group at the mall?

04:01.850 --> 04:03.330
[laughs fake laugh]

04:03.373 --> 04:06.202
Uh, no. I'm heading
to the hospital, and I need

04:06.246 --> 04:09.118
an answer on which four people
are gonna have their day ruined.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.424
What are you talking about?

04:10.467 --> 04:11.990
I told you last week.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.079
We can't give out
five research grants.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.778
You wanted to be in charge,
so be in charge. Choose one.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.041
Okay, I'm delegating you
to handle it.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.782
I can't do everything for you.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.305
I have a company to run.Well, don't worry.

04:22.349 --> 04:26.527
The days of you being on
top of me are almost over.

04:26.570 --> 04:30.618
The chief of staff is retiring,
and I plan on taking his place.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.011
You? Chief of staff?Mm-hmm.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.535
How many other candidates
do you plan

04:34.578 --> 04:36.101
on poisoning
to make that happen?

04:36.145 --> 04:38.321
None. For now.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
No, I want to do
this the right way.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.978
And once they see that
I'm the best man for the job,

04:43.021 --> 04:45.589
then both you and I will be
calling the shots at work.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.330
Oh, how cute.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.941
You comparing your job
at the hospital to my job

04:49.985 --> 04:52.901
as CEO and founder
of a massive media conglomerate.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.337
I think it's good, though,

04:54.381 --> 04:57.209
for someone in our family
to be of the common folk.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.559
It helps people relate to us.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.604
Door?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.131
[indistinct chatter,
elevator bell dings]

05:06.175 --> 05:07.916
What is so important
that I had to unclip

05:07.959 --> 05:09.483
from my spin bike
and run over here?

05:09.526 --> 05:11.615
And what is on your face?

05:11.659 --> 05:14.444
Depuffing and reenergizing
eye masks.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.664
Which I'm in desperate need of,

05:16.707 --> 05:18.274
thanks to
the long-distance relationship

05:18.318 --> 05:19.710
I need to vent about.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.060
So you interrupted my workout
to complain?

05:22.104 --> 05:24.280
I knew you'd understand.[groans]

05:24.324 --> 05:27.327
Between the quick trips to
New Orleans for a day or two

05:27.370 --> 05:30.286
and staying up 'till Ryan gets
off work at the strip club,

05:30.330 --> 05:33.420
I don't think I've been this
sleep-deprived since... ever.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.073
I need a filter

05:35.117 --> 05:36.292
IRL.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.946
So, what's your plan?

05:37.989 --> 05:40.514
Well, Ryan's interviewing
at Western Atlanta right now.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.212
And my plan is to cross
my fingers and hope he gets in.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.909
Look,

05:44.953 --> 05:47.259
don't get so stressed out
over this.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.435
You and Ryan are
still kind of new.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.914
New Orleans is only

05:49.958 --> 05:51.481
two hours away,
and you fly private.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.091
You can handle it
for a little longer.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.267
Yeah, but long distance is hard.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.530
And I really like Ryan.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.096
I want him around.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.402
How else are we supposed
to figure out

05:59.446 --> 06:01.099
if the relationship has legs?

06:01.143 --> 06:02.623
Plus,

06:02.666 --> 06:06.322
I need to be camera-ready 24/7,
thanks to FaceTime.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.193
So why don't you tell him that?

06:08.237 --> 06:11.545
About your feelings.
Not the camera-ready part.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.764
Well, you said it yourself.
It's a new relationship.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.637
If I put too much pressure
on it, it'll fall apart.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.552
Speaking of flying private,

06:18.595 --> 06:23.644
why is a new multimillionaire
like yourself still in Atlanta

06:23.687 --> 06:26.037
when you should be jetting off
to your dream destination?

06:26.081 --> 06:27.822
I'm frugal.

06:27.865 --> 06:31.434
And this whole being rich thing
kind of freaks me out.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.132
Yeah, I was weirded out
the first couple hours, too.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.700
I have the perfect entrée

06:36.744 --> 06:38.876
to the lifestyles
of the rich and famous.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.225
Why don't you stay here

06:40.269 --> 06:41.792
in the presidential suite

06:41.836 --> 06:43.620
for a few days on the house?Whoa.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.144
That suite is bigger
than my apartment.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.016
And that makes me sad.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.235
[computer chimes]Here you go.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.367
And please

06:51.411 --> 06:53.282
check out
StuffRichPeopleBuy.com.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.544
That's a real thing?

06:54.588 --> 06:56.328
Oh, it's the premier site

06:56.372 --> 06:57.591
to find
ridiculously expensive things

06:57.634 --> 07:00.332
you never knew you needed.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.986
Where do you think I got this?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.250
It's real diamonds.Uh-uh.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.603
As you know, Fallon Unlimited
has acquired a new tech company,

07:09.646 --> 07:11.431
which is currently
pre-profitable.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.911
That a newfangled way
of saying it's losing money?

07:13.955 --> 07:18.089
Yes. And your job is
to make it profitable.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.309
Well, it's a little smaller

07:20.352 --> 07:23.225
than I'm used to,
and I'll need to redecorate,

07:23.268 --> 07:25.575
but I'll make it work.This is my office.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.317
Well, thank God, 'cause
I couldn't make this work.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.492
Oh, hey, where is my office?

07:29.536 --> 07:32.930
I'd like a...
a northern-facing corner.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.541
Oh, and where is the girl
that brings me coffee?

07:34.584 --> 07:37.544
Your office is down the hall,
I don't care what corner

07:37.587 --> 07:39.197
it faces, and there
is no girl here

07:39.241 --> 07:40.634
to bring you coffee.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.026
I am the only one
with an assistant.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.028
Well, do I have a team
working underneath me?

07:44.072 --> 07:45.508
Yes, they are, uh,

07:45.552 --> 07:47.249
team-building right now.
[sniffles]

07:48.555 --> 07:50.426
Daily yoga for 20 more minutes.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.297
Anyway, until they get back,

07:52.341 --> 07:56.040
why don't you fill me in
on your cost-cutting ideas?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.346
Uh, no, no, I'm-I'm good.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.608
You're good?

07:58.652 --> 07:59.914
Well, let's not forget.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.872
I am your boss,
and I want to make sure

08:01.916 --> 08:03.395
you're headed
in the right direction.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.658
Hey, you hired Blake Carrington,

08:04.701 --> 08:06.137
so why don't you let Blake
be Blake

08:06.181 --> 08:07.399
and trust that I know
what I'm doing?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.314
I don't trust anyone
who refers to himself

08:09.358 --> 08:11.273
in the third person three times.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.536
Well, I'm just not comfortable
sharing at this point.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.539
Well, I am not comfortable
with you hiding your game plan,

08:16.583 --> 08:19.150
especially since
you're on my payroll.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.065
Hey, speaking of which,
when can we renegotiate?

08:21.109 --> 08:23.067
My salary feels low.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.809
Martina? Uh... Martina?

08:25.853 --> 08:28.116
Coffee!I thought we decided

08:28.159 --> 08:29.596
you weren't drinking coffee
this early.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.336
Okay, well,
we've changed our minds.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.337
BLAKE:
Make that two, would you?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.470
Uh, cream and sugar.
Thanks, doll.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.690
No problem, Mr. Carrington.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.344
No, no, no, no, no. Martina,
Martina, scratch that coffee!

08:39.388 --> 08:41.172
How do you expect me
to get anything done?

08:41.216 --> 08:43.087
I don't know. Maybe
ask Blake Carrington

08:43.131 --> 08:45.307
to get Blake Carrington a cup
of coffee from the kitchen.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.874
Get my own?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.310
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

08:48.353 --> 08:50.138
I was working
at a gas station mini-mart.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.140
[exhales] Okay,
you know what?

08:52.183 --> 08:56.448
Please go. Please leave
my office, go work. Thank you.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.887
Uno, does, tres.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.932
♪

09:23.475 --> 09:25.782
What can I get you?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.828
Uh...BLAKE: Pinot Grigio.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.351
Extra cold.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.571
Bourbon Manhattan.
You got it.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.573
I never thought I'd see the day

09:33.616 --> 09:35.662
Blake Carrington
got off work in time

09:35.705 --> 09:37.751
for two-for-one happy hour
drink specials.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.535
Well, I never thought
I'd see myself

09:39.579 --> 09:42.669
buying two-for-one drinks
at all, but here we are.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.672
Hey, I'm employed now.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.282
Can I take you to dinner
tomorrow night?

09:47.325 --> 09:49.414
I'd love that.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.374
I'm very impressed
you agreed to work for Fallon.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.680
It clearly agrees with you.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.551
You seem relaxed.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.597
You know, I'd be more relaxed
if I could wash the day off

09:57.640 --> 09:59.903
in the giant soaking tub
in the manor

09:59.947 --> 10:02.036
instead of this
middle-class sized tub here.

10:03.254 --> 10:06.344
You know the one
I'm talking about, right?

10:06.388 --> 10:08.042
That tub built for two?

10:08.085 --> 10:10.958
I did love getting those jets
fired up.
[laughs]

10:11.001 --> 10:13.047
And look, the place is great.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.701
Thank you.
It really is, but

10:14.744 --> 10:16.354
it can't compete
with Gunnerson

10:16.398 --> 10:18.922
delivering ice cream sundaes
to us in bed, can it?

10:18.966 --> 10:21.055
I miss my walk-in closet.Oh. [laughs]

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
And the flowers everywhere.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.672
Your Manhattan.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.761
Thank you. Hmm.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.853
That's right. But no, I-I'm
pretty sure I crushed it.

10:36.897 --> 10:37.941
Of course you did.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.595
Western Atlanta
would be lucky

10:39.639 --> 10:41.815
to have
your brilliant legal mind.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.252
Aw, thanks, babe.
That's really sweet.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.732
And they did say

10:45.775 --> 10:47.734
that my acceptance letter
is in the mail.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.997
[chuckles]
Congratulations!

10:50.040 --> 10:51.651
This is great news.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.828
Why aren't you acting
like it's great news?Oh,

10:54.871 --> 10:55.916
it is. It's just, uh,

10:55.959 --> 10:57.613
you know, tuition's
crazy expensive,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
and there are no
scholarships left.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.878
And Tulane offered me
a lot more money

11:01.922 --> 11:03.837
to go there,
so I'm torn.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.665
Well, do you like
this school better?

11:05.708 --> 11:06.883
Sure.
But it's not just about that.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.624
If I go to Tulane,

11:08.668 --> 11:09.799
I-I don't have to move,

11:09.843 --> 11:11.105
and I could stop working
at the club

11:11.148 --> 11:12.672
and focus on school instead.

11:12.715 --> 11:15.675
As a businessman,
I've been told several times

11:15.718 --> 11:17.851
not to make decisions
solely based on money.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.504
[chuckles]
Yeah, that's something

11:19.548 --> 11:21.245
only a rich person can say.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.335
Money is a huge part
of this decision.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.554
I was a poor person

11:25.597 --> 11:27.512
for way longer
than I've been rich.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.123
Trust me, I get it.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.298
But, I mean,

11:30.341 --> 11:31.516
money can't be the only factor.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.518
Maybe not. But the idea

11:33.562 --> 11:36.043
of-of racking up law
school debt is...

11:36.086 --> 11:37.871
Ugh, it gives me heartburn.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.265
Not to mention, you know,
finding a place to live and...

11:41.309 --> 11:42.702
But you like Atlanta, right?

11:42.745 --> 11:45.269
Yeah, I-I love
Atlanta. But, uh,

11:45.313 --> 11:46.706
you know,
New Orleans has everything

11:46.749 --> 11:47.881
you've got here, right?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.970
Well, almost everything.[scoffs]

11:51.623 --> 11:53.060
ANDERS:
Michael.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.062
I heard you sold the Atlantix.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.716
Congratulations.Thank you.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.847
Drink?

11:57.891 --> 11:59.501
No, no, no. Keeps me awake.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.155
I'll put this on the room,
Mr. Culhane?

12:01.198 --> 12:03.853
Uh, martini. Up. Thank you.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.463
[chuckles]You're staying here?

12:05.507 --> 12:07.378
Eh, just for a few nights.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.598
Sam set me up
in the presidential suite.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.513
He thinks
I need to work on being rich.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.775
[chuckles]And now

12:12.819 --> 12:14.472
I can't stop looking
at this website.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.648
I'm quite familiar with it.
I've spent quite a few nights

12:16.692 --> 12:18.650
bidding on things for Blake.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.609
Has something caught your eye?Well, I already splurged

12:20.652 --> 12:22.132
on this jacket.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.831
One of the Atlantix players
recommended his stylist.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.268
100% Mongolian goat wool.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.660
That's cashmere.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.924
Apparently,
Russian oligarchs love it.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.492
But a jacket is child's play
compared to this.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.581
Oh, that is lovely.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.846
Is that...An Aston Martin
driven by James Bond?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.804
Yes, it is.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.720
[exhales] As a kid,
I always wanted to be a spy,

12:44.764 --> 12:46.330
and I thought
Bond was the coolest.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.811
And I love cars.Well,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.771
I always say if you
can afford it, treat yourself.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.034
But do check and make sure it is

12:54.077 --> 12:55.818
007's Aston, hmm?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.689
'Cause Sam is right.
You have a bit to learn

12:57.733 --> 12:59.866
about being rich. Thank you.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.610
A Russian oligarch
wouldn't be seen dead

13:05.654 --> 13:08.135
wearing fake cashmere.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.141
You ready?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.577
Yes, sir. Just say the word,

13:15.620 --> 13:16.752
and we can get to work.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.709
Let's do this.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.712
Well, we are making cuts
across the board.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.628
You know the old saying:
last one hired, first one fired.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.847
No?

13:24.891 --> 13:27.154
Well, you do now.
Anders will show you out.

13:29.634 --> 13:30.722
You two do the same job,

13:30.766 --> 13:32.986
which makes
one of you a redundancy.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.770
So, fight it out
to see who gets to stay.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.729
[chuckles]:
No, I'm just kidding with you.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.253
You're both fired.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.518
Bull's-eye.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.911
Find out
which one of these guys is Jamie

13:44.954 --> 13:46.608
and tell him to
pack up his desk.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.611
I think you'll find
Jamie is a female, sir.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.701
Oh, it's a bad day to be Jamie.
Fire her, too.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.487
Oh, uh, you won't be needing
this anymore.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.707
Take that as a souvenir.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.143
Anyone else?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.797
I believe that's everyone, sir.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.538
I just made
Fallon's new purchase profitable

14:03.581 --> 14:05.105
in less than 48 hours,

14:05.148 --> 14:08.717
and tonight, I am having
a romantic dinner Cristal.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.588
I feel great.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.677
Your methods are effective.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.897
[line ringing]I'm sure
Fallon will be impressed.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.813
I need to make
this reservation first.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.641
FALLON:
What have you done?

14:19.684 --> 14:20.990
And why are people crying?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.036
You know I hate
public displays of emotion.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.690
Well, I'm just doing the
job you hired me to do.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.736
My office.Just let me finish this call.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.303
Now.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.879
I cannot believe you just fired
30 people without consulting me!

14:39.922 --> 14:41.532
Actually, it was 29.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.360
Turns out
Jamie's just one person.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.232
When I told you to cut costs,

14:45.275 --> 14:46.842
I didn't mean fire people.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.322
I could have
done that myself.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.933
I am trying to cultivate
a stress-free culture here.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.849
You know, a place where people
actually want to come to work.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.590
I mean, that is what
makes a company successful.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.983
I know
what a successful company is,

14:57.026 --> 14:58.114
but thank you for the lesson.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.507
And yoga

14:59.550 --> 15:01.074
and pedicures at your
desk, that's just a...

15:01.117 --> 15:02.902
a little too stress-free.Okay.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.642
Well, guess what?
This is not Carrington Atlantic,

15:04.686 --> 15:06.644
and I don't need to do things
the way you did them

15:06.688 --> 15:08.472
because this is my company!

15:08.516 --> 15:10.692
I get it.
You want to make your mark.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.738
You're still new
at the CEO thing.

15:13.782 --> 15:17.307
No. You are taking advantage
of this relationship.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.962
You would never speak
to another CEO this way.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.573
Iam the one
being taken advantage of here.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.401
Another CEO
would kill to have

15:24.445 --> 15:25.620
a Blake Carrington
at their company.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.405
Stop speaking
in the third person.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.016
Anyone with a brain
would have done

15:30.059 --> 15:31.669
the same thing that I did.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.671
Your company is bloated.
I trimmed the fat.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.673
You are on probation.
Starting now.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.024
Probation. What is this,
boarding school?Mm-hmm.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.070
First, you are gonna hire back
all the people that you fired,

15:41.114 --> 15:43.464
and then you are gonna come up
with a real solution

15:43.507 --> 15:46.032
for the problem that you
were brought here to solve.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.250
What do you want me to do?
You want me

15:47.294 --> 15:48.599
to get rid
of the kombucha water coolers?

15:48.643 --> 15:50.558
Figure it out!
And pray that I don't get sued

15:50.601 --> 15:52.125
for wrongful termination.

15:52.168 --> 15:55.955
From now on,
you play by the rules or else.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.782
I am playing by the rules.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.655
Your 3:00
old-fashioned, sir.[sighs]

16:00.698 --> 16:01.786
Those are not the rules.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.005
Well, they're my rules.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.660
So, technically,
hmm, still rules.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.404
How'd you sleep up there?Mmm.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.667
Like I was wrapped
in a cloud.[chuckles]

16:12.710 --> 16:15.017
Who knew expensive sheets
could make such a difference?

16:15.061 --> 16:16.801
Everyone?

16:16.845 --> 16:20.153
So, now are you in the headspace
to bid on something big?

16:20.196 --> 16:23.286
Though not on these
mother-of-pearl cuff links

16:23.330 --> 16:25.375
from the Galápagos.Well,

16:25.419 --> 16:27.508
there is something,
but I don't want to jinx it

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
by talking about it. So...Oh.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.860
What's the law school latest?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.035
Okay, good news:

16:33.079 --> 16:36.038
Ryan got accepted
into Western Atlanta.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.953
Yes.Bad news: he's not going.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.041
They didn't offer him

16:39.085 --> 16:40.651
a scholarship, and Tulane did.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.088
Well, did you tell him
you want him to come here?

16:42.131 --> 16:43.393
It wouldn't have made
a difference.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.178
It's all about money,
not about us.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.396
So, what does this mean?

16:46.440 --> 16:48.137
I think it could mean the end.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.182
My focus is being pulled

16:49.225 --> 16:51.053
in too many directions.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.489
Last time I was in New Orleans,

16:52.533 --> 16:55.057
I missed a chance to buy
that vacant space next door,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.494
and I wanted to put a coffee bar
in the lobby.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.628
Good call.
You could sell muffins.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.369
Mm-mm.Ah! Or warm cookies.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.371
Okay, relax. It's not happening.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.547
That's the point. Of
course, the entire problem

17:06.590 --> 17:09.767
could be solved if he would
just let me pay for law school.

17:09.811 --> 17:10.942
But he won't.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.683
Showy displays of wealth

17:12.727 --> 17:14.033
make him uncomfortable.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.121
[exhales]I mean,

17:15.164 --> 17:16.252
most people would love

17:16.296 --> 17:17.688
to be serenaded
by a Backstreet Boy

17:17.732 --> 17:19.603
or get constant gift baskets.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.736
A lot of people

17:21.779 --> 17:24.434
feel weird taking money
from friends and family.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.914
But they borrow
from faceless institutions

17:25.957 --> 17:27.568
all the time
without thinking twice about it.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.310
Were there really
no scholarships

17:30.353 --> 17:32.225
at Western Atlanta?He said they
were all taken.

17:32.268 --> 17:35.402
But maybe I should check
and make sure that's true.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.664
KIRBY:
The hosts

17:36.707 --> 17:38.535
specifically requested
no champagne

17:38.579 --> 17:39.754
because apparently the bubbles

17:39.797 --> 17:41.799
go straight
to Great-Aunt Stella's head.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.109
It's good to see you back.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.893
So, you're feeling better?Physically,

17:48.937 --> 17:51.244
I feel great.That's wonderful.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.636
You must be happy
to be back on your feet.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.464
Oh, yes.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.814
Thrilled.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.991
Is everything okay? You seem
a little... not thrilled.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.777
I'm sorry.
Just some personal stuff

18:02.820 --> 18:05.867
I've been dealing with.You've been through a
lot. You can't overlook

18:05.910 --> 18:07.738
the mental aspect
of your recovery.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.480
It's just as important
as the physical.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.482
Are you having nightmares?

18:12.526 --> 18:14.267
Nope. Nothing like that.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.660
Of course. We don't have to talk
about it if you don't...

18:16.704 --> 18:17.705
It's Adam.

18:17.748 --> 18:18.880
He's acting weird.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.273
In the bedroom.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.622
And not the good weird.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.799
Is there such a thing as seeing
too much of a person's body?

18:24.842 --> 18:27.410
Because I don't think
he's attracted to mine anymore.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.326
He's being distant
and avoiding me.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.328
I mean, usually,
our sex life is...

18:32.372 --> 18:33.808
I-I get it.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.592
Um, but...[sighs]

18:35.636 --> 18:37.986
This probably isn't about you.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.379
Well, what else
could it be about?

18:39.422 --> 18:40.945
All he does is work
and hang out with me.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.643
Adam has a
stressful job.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.471
And with Blake,
if he was

18:44.514 --> 18:45.950
having a problem
in the boardroom,

18:45.994 --> 18:48.649
it would sometimes turn into
a problem in the bedroom.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.173
Oh, I hadn't thought about it
like that.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.783
Thanks, Cristal.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.177
Oh, and while you're here,

18:55.221 --> 18:57.614
I have been meaning
to apologize to you.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.486
For blackmailing me about Caleb

18:59.529 --> 19:01.444
to save Adam's job
at the hospital?

19:01.488 --> 19:02.837
Oh, no,
I don't feel bad about that.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.795
[exhales]But I didn't mean
to out you and Caleb

19:04.839 --> 19:06.319
at Fallon's rehearsal dinner.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.669
That was a faulty microphone,
so I am sorry about that.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.018
[chuckles]

19:13.064 --> 19:14.805
Thank you so much for staying
with us. Please enjoy

19:14.849 --> 19:16.807
a complimentary
cocktail at the bar.Thank you.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.419
Hey. You. What's
in the bags?

19:19.462 --> 19:20.507
Did you win the bid?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.204
New underwear.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.337
The price kept going up.
I had to drop out.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.642
On the website.

19:25.686 --> 19:26.991
The underwear was on sale.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.690
Okay, so, now that it's
no longer jinxable,

19:29.733 --> 19:30.908
what were you bidding on?

19:30.952 --> 19:34.260
[sighs]
James Bond's 1964 Aston Martin.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.391
Oof!But I can't spend

19:35.435 --> 19:36.610
that much on a car,

19:36.653 --> 19:37.872
no matter how cool it is.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.831
Oh, please.
You can afford 20 of those cars.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.529
Well, that's a
lot of underwear.

19:42.572 --> 19:43.834
Maybe 19.[chuckles]

19:43.878 --> 19:45.793
I'm starting to wonder
if I might not be

19:45.836 --> 19:47.490
the kind of rich guy
you think I should be.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.927
I just don't need
a lot of stuff.It's one car.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.407
Hey.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.756
Hope I'm not interrupting.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.932
Actually, I'm grateful.Oh.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.891
You look happy.I do?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.415
Uh, I registered
for classes at Tulane today.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.243
Oh, congrats.Thanks.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.593
Nothing else happened?Uh...

20:03.637 --> 20:05.204
I had a really good doughnut?[Sam chuckles]

20:05.247 --> 20:09.077
Uh, well, I-I was thinking
maybe something else happened?

20:10.121 --> 20:11.732
Something more exciting
than a doughnut?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.908
Though doughnuts are
good. Don't get me wrong.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.692
But, um... Nothing, huh?

20:15.736 --> 20:17.477
Nope.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.695
Anyway, uh,

20:18.739 --> 20:20.044
I'm gonna go order
my books now.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.830
The used ones go fast,
so... See you.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.575
What is the matter with you?

20:28.618 --> 20:30.185
What are you talking about?Well, he didn't seem

20:30.229 --> 20:32.579
that happy, and you were talking
about doughnuts.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.797
Okay, fine.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.974
I happen to know
that Ryan was offered

20:37.018 --> 20:38.759
a full scholarship
to Western Atlanta today,

20:38.802 --> 20:40.369
and he didn't say
a word about it.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.763
And how do you happen
to know that?

20:42.806 --> 20:44.243
Because I followed your advice,

20:44.286 --> 20:46.332
and I wrote a check
to the school,

20:46.375 --> 20:48.334
and poof,
a scholarship appeared.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.901
That was not my advice.
I just asked

20:50.945 --> 20:53.164
if there were
any scholarships left.It doesn't matter.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.862
I thought money
was the only thing

20:54.905 --> 20:56.994
keeping him in New Orleans,
but clearly,

20:57.038 --> 20:58.866
that's not the case.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.434
I thought spending seven figures
on a car was a bad idea,

21:01.477 --> 21:02.913
but this somehow seems worse.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.220
Maybe it's a good thing
he didn't mention it,

21:05.264 --> 21:07.744
because if I was Ryan
and I found out,

21:07.788 --> 21:10.312
ha, not good.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.795
Jamie! Welcome back.

21:14.838 --> 21:15.839
[clears throat]

21:16.884 --> 21:19.147
Jamie. Welcome back.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.931
Uh, thank you for not suing.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.717
There was a miscommunication
from the top down.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.935
Okay. Back to work.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.158
[exhales]

21:30.201 --> 21:31.899
Is now a good time to talk?

21:31.942 --> 21:33.335
I told you to wait
for me in the lobby.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
I have another meeting
across town after this,

21:34.902 --> 21:36.077
so let's get down to it.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.644
How can I help?

21:37.687 --> 21:40.299
Well, first, my daughter
can't know anything about this.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.653
Is there a point to
this conversation, Dr. Bailey?Yes. Because

21:46.696 --> 21:48.307
no one else will give
it to you straight.

21:48.350 --> 21:52.311
Fortunately, I don't mind
delivering bad news.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.095
Ah. Your patients
are lucky to have you.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.749
Drop out of the running
for chief.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.228
You don't
have a shot.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.578
Everybody knows
you have this job

21:58.621 --> 22:00.188
because of your last name.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.886
That's simply not true. I went
to med school, same as you.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.324
Right. So you can practice
medicine in this hospital,

22:05.367 --> 22:07.108
but you're not qualified
to run it.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.458
A fact that I will
be highlighting

22:09.502 --> 22:11.330
along with your many
other shortcomings

22:11.373 --> 22:12.461
to the board tomorrow.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.681
And when
I take over,

22:14.724 --> 22:17.292
it'll be time
to reevaluate the staff.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.558
That bitch doctor can't talk
to my boyfriend like that.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.168
Meet me back here in two hours
when your shift's over.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.256
I have an idea.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.606
I can tell by the look
on your face

22:26.649 --> 22:28.172
this is something
I should be worried about.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.218
Aw. You should trust me.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.350
It's gonna be fun.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.482
And I won't take no
for an answer.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.050
So I'll see you
in two hours.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.098
[sizzling]

22:41.142 --> 22:42.491
You know,
I'm pretty sure the last time

22:42.535 --> 22:44.363
I took orders from someone,
I was seven years old

22:44.406 --> 22:45.929
at sleepaway camp
for the summer.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.235
And by the end
of the second week,

22:47.278 --> 22:48.976
I was paying the counselor
to make my bed.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.151
[chuckles softly]

22:50.194 --> 22:52.458
I'm just used
to doing things my way.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.198
And, let the record reflect,

22:54.242 --> 22:56.113
it built me
a multibillion-dollar company.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.724
And let the record also reflect

22:57.767 --> 23:00.422
that your way cost
you that company.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.773
And your wife.
And your house.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.296
Okay.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.559
I get it.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.429
I'm just suggesting
that maybe you listen

23:07.473 --> 23:08.691
to what
Fallon's saying.

23:08.735 --> 23:12.303
I know you can be flexible
when you want to.

23:12.347 --> 23:15.306
You need to learn that taking
other people's feelings

23:15.350 --> 23:17.483
into consideration
is not weakness.

23:17.526 --> 23:21.312
Why do I get the feeling we're
no longer talking about Fallon?

23:25.795 --> 23:27.101
What was that for?

23:27.144 --> 23:28.494
For listening

23:28.537 --> 23:30.365
and paying attention.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.934
I would love to return the favor
and hear more about your day,

23:33.977 --> 23:35.326
but I'm exhausted.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.328
I haven't had a minute
to sit all day.

23:37.372 --> 23:41.332
And... I'm afraid if
I stay another minute,

23:41.376 --> 23:44.161
I will faceplant in this
eggplant parm. [chuckles]

23:44.205 --> 23:45.859
Well, let me get you back.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.601
Scuse me.
The check, please?

23:48.644 --> 23:51.430
Promise me you'll
try with Fallon.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.909
For you?

23:52.953 --> 23:54.476
I promise.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.568
Hey!

23:59.612 --> 24:02.136
I don't know how your dad
got any work done in here.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.747
I mean, his whiskey
collection is...

24:04.791 --> 24:06.401
is sick.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.796
Yes. Well, Blake invests heavily
in bourbon futures.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.232
Mm.

24:11.275 --> 24:12.320
I'm drinking rye.

24:12.363 --> 24:13.582
What can I say?

24:13.626 --> 24:16.411
He has a diverse portfolio.
[inhales]

24:16.455 --> 24:18.282
How's the writing going?
[exhales]

24:18.326 --> 24:20.067
Oh, it's not.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.678
Yeah, I'm completely uninspired.

24:22.722 --> 24:26.029
I just-- I-I don't care about
the book I sold my publisher.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.031
It just-- It feels
so insignificant,

24:28.075 --> 24:30.860
like... if I
didn't write it,

24:30.904 --> 24:32.253
it wouldn't matter.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.559
Well, shouldn't writers write

24:33.602 --> 24:35.386
about something
meaningful to them

24:35.430 --> 24:37.737
because then it'll be meaningful
to others?

24:39.826 --> 24:41.218
You're right.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.350
[chuckles]

24:42.393 --> 24:44.265
My wife is the
smartest woman on Earth.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.440
[chuckles]

24:45.484 --> 24:47.616
Let's have a drink
to celebrate?

24:47.660 --> 24:48.878
[chuckles]:
No, no, no, no, no.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.663
I think you've had enough,
Hemingway.

24:50.706 --> 24:53.448
Maybe you
should get some rest,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.842
and then I'll try to figure out
how I'm gonna deal with Blake.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.192
Well, I'll tell you
how you deal with him. Okay?Uh-huh.

24:58.235 --> 25:02.022
If it's not working,
you fire his ass.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.284
Okay, well, thank you

25:03.327 --> 25:05.112
for that well-thought-out
piece of advice,

25:05.155 --> 25:06.330
but I can't do that.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.767
Mm, but you're the boss.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.290
Okay? You can do
whatever you want.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.205
I hired Blake

25:11.248 --> 25:13.424
because I promised I would keep
this family together.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.949
That's the only way
the dynasty can be rebuilt.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.734
I mean, do you think
the Kennedys all gather together

25:18.778 --> 25:20.736
in Hyannis Port
because they like each other?

25:20.780 --> 25:21.998
[chuckles]
Of course not.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.478
Yeah, exactly.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.306
It's because
they want to show the world

25:25.349 --> 25:26.786
that their dynasty
can endure,

25:26.829 --> 25:28.439
in good times and in bad.

25:28.483 --> 25:31.442
And, besides, firing Blake
would be... [sighs]

25:31.486 --> 25:33.357
it would be such a failure
on so many levels.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.359
And I don't like to fail.
On any level.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.579
Okay, well, you're just gonna
have to be more patient

25:37.623 --> 25:41.278
and give Blake more than
two days to fall in line.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.454
Okay? And maybe
try counting

25:43.498 --> 25:46.022
to ten instead of five
when it gets tough.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.415
Do you know
that much Spanish?

25:47.458 --> 25:48.416
[chuckles]

25:48.459 --> 25:49.548
[piano playing softly]

25:49.591 --> 25:51.375
What's all this?

25:51.419 --> 25:55.249
What? Can't a guy plan a-a night
of over-the-top romance

25:55.292 --> 25:56.555
for all the good
things in his life?

25:56.598 --> 25:58.208
Cheese fondue?

25:58.252 --> 25:59.601
Of course.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.649
So, uh...
[exhales]

26:03.692 --> 26:06.129
I know that long
distance can be hard.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.523
But, uh, we've made it
work so far, right?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.656
We've always been open and
honest with each other.

26:10.699 --> 26:13.310
You know? There's-there's
no drama, no games.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.834
Right.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.705
So, uh, you said
you wanted to celebrate

26:16.749 --> 26:18.577
the good things in your life.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.100
[inhales] Like?

26:20.143 --> 26:22.406
Like...
this cheese.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.583
But if... if
you don't like it,

26:24.626 --> 26:26.106
then you need to
tell me the truth.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.934
Okay? I-I can take it.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.853
Look, I know you were offered a
scholarship to Western Atlanta.

26:33.896 --> 26:37.552
So if things are so good between
us, then why didn't you take it?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.075
How did you know about that?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.078
I'm the reason
you got the scholarship.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.993
[scoffs]

26:44.037 --> 26:45.995
I donated money to the school
so they would offer it to you.

26:46.039 --> 26:49.042
See, I-I knew something was off.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.609
Which is why I didn't take it.

26:50.652 --> 26:54.090
I researched every scholarship
available when I applied,

26:54.134 --> 26:56.353
but I'd never heard of this one
until it landed in my email.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.007
Well, it seemed like you really
wanted to go to school here

26:58.051 --> 26:59.661
but you couldn't afford it.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.837
And I can.
So what's the big deal?

27:01.881 --> 27:03.578
The big deal?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.841
The big deal, Sam,
is that you invented

27:05.885 --> 27:07.669
a scholarship so that
I'd take your money,

27:07.713 --> 27:10.019
which you know I would
never do if you asked.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.588
You ignored my wishes and-and
created an el-elaborate con

27:13.632 --> 27:14.589
to make a fool of me.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.896
Ryan. Ryan.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.638
I was just trying to do
something nice with my money!

27:24.120 --> 27:25.905
You're sure Dr. Bailey
finished her shift?

27:25.948 --> 27:27.341
Positive.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.430
I heard her talking
to the nurses on her way out.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.432
She's taking a pickling class.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.999
Pickling?

27:33.042 --> 27:34.174
Organs?

27:34.217 --> 27:36.045
Onions and root vegetables.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.394
Great.[blinds close]

27:37.438 --> 27:38.700
Then we can get down
to business.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.094
Yes. Business.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.705
I-I don't think
copying her presentation's

27:43.749 --> 27:44.706
gonna get me the job.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.055
She's up first in the morning.

27:46.099 --> 27:48.188
I'm not gonna copy it.

27:48.231 --> 27:51.191
I'm just gonna...
spice it up a little.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.063
Accentuate what's already here.

27:54.107 --> 27:57.632
Which, by the way,
looks insanely boring.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.809
[woman giggling]

28:00.853 --> 28:03.072
I'm not sure if this violates
the Hippocratic oath,

28:03.116 --> 28:06.946
but I'm sure porn breaks
all sorts of hospital rules.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.251
[woman giggles]

28:08.295 --> 28:09.731
Wow.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.473
[panting]How does she bend
like that?

28:12.516 --> 28:14.693
[giggles][exhales]

28:14.736 --> 28:16.172
WOMAN: Oh. [giggles][clears throat]

28:16.216 --> 28:19.001
I'm gonna put this
after Bailey's slide

28:19.045 --> 28:23.005
on advancements
in cardiothoracic laser surgery.

28:23.049 --> 28:26.530
[chuckles]This is an excellent idea.

28:26.574 --> 28:29.446
And it's also making
me feel kind of...

28:29.490 --> 28:31.361
Me, too.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.407
[woman giggling, moaning]

28:42.808 --> 28:44.418
Oh, you heading back home?

28:44.461 --> 28:45.767
Can't get there fast enough.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.422
I know it's probably
none of my business,

28:48.465 --> 28:50.424
but I'm guessing
you found out what Sam did?

28:50.467 --> 28:53.514
Though if you didn't,
forget I said that.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.298
Yeah. He told me
about the fake scholarship.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.778
Uh, that doesn't make it
any better.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.171
No, probably not.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.173
But it came
from a good place.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.652
[exhales]This might

29:01.696 --> 29:04.264
sound strange, but...

29:04.307 --> 29:06.788
it can be hard to have
the kind of money Sam has

29:06.832 --> 29:09.617
and not want to solve
every problem with it.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.880
Yeah, it's just I've been
in too many relationships

29:11.924 --> 29:14.317
where the person who holds the
purse strings holds the power.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.842
Believe me,
I've been there.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.496
If I move here
and let him pay for law school,

29:19.540 --> 29:21.281
I'm gonna feel like a kept man.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.283
Next thing you know,
I'll be living in a penthouse

29:23.326 --> 29:24.980
and driving a sports car
that's not mine.

29:25.024 --> 29:28.070
Which, yes,
doesn't sound so bad

29:28.114 --> 29:29.245
when you hear it out loud.Mm-hmm.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.987
The point is, Sam lied to me.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.423
Not in his mind.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.600
Do you have time
for a quick chat over breakfast?

29:36.644 --> 29:38.864
I can explain.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.300
And if it makes you
feel any better,

29:40.343 --> 29:42.389
I'll let you pay.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.433
[chuckles softly]

29:45.218 --> 29:47.263
Thought you could use some
sustenance to handle Blake.

29:47.307 --> 29:48.699
Aw!

29:48.743 --> 29:50.919
How sweet. But shouldn't you
be home writing?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.660
Or are you still hungover?

29:52.703 --> 29:55.358
[chuckles] I have been sitting
in front of my computer

29:55.402 --> 29:56.272
all morning.

29:56.316 --> 29:57.708
Well, that sounds promising.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.319
Not really.[sighs]

29:59.362 --> 30:01.147
Last night, when I was doing
my best Hemingway impression,

30:01.190 --> 30:02.975
you toldme to...

30:03.018 --> 30:04.498
to write what's meaningful.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.108
But, Fallon,
I'm writing a book

30:06.152 --> 30:07.501
about made-up people
with made-up problems.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.503
You know? I-I want
to make an impact in the world.

30:09.546 --> 30:10.765
[inhales]

30:10.809 --> 30:12.462
So I gave the money back
to the publisher.

30:12.506 --> 30:13.681
Wow.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.248
That was not a small advance.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.945
Yeah. Probably wasn't
the smartest idea,

30:16.989 --> 30:19.165
because I'm sure my mother's
already taken me out of her will

30:19.208 --> 30:20.253
by now. But...

30:20.296 --> 30:21.689
this isn't about money.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.386
Clearly not. That reminds me,

30:23.430 --> 30:25.301
we haven't merged
our bank accounts yet, have we?

30:25.345 --> 30:26.650
Funny.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.349
Anyway, Hemingway
was a journalist first.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.785
So I'm thinking
maybe I should get back

30:30.829 --> 30:32.743
to my investigative journalism
roots, you know?

30:32.787 --> 30:35.355
I-I want to do something
that makes me feel alive.[phone chimes, buzzes]

30:35.398 --> 30:36.965
You know? Something
that has purpose.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.619
I want to get
my hands dirty.

30:38.662 --> 30:39.925
I mean, there's
a lot of corruption

30:39.968 --> 30:40.926
happening in the world,

30:40.969 --> 30:42.144
and I want
to root it out.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.232
You've got to be kidding me.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.234
No, I'm not. I'm doing this.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.976
What? No. No, not you.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.283
Blake is already looking
for a new job.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.198
How do you know that?He just sent an email.

30:52.241 --> 30:55.418
He sent you an email saying
he was looking for a new job?

30:55.462 --> 30:57.420
No, the email
wasn't sent to me.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.988
I have access to all
of my employees' emails.

31:00.032 --> 31:04.210
The program flags ones with
certain buzzwords like "jobs"

31:04.253 --> 31:07.300
or "stealing" or
"evil witch boss."

31:07.343 --> 31:10.825
And so Blake sent an email
to this executive headhunter.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.046
There was a contract attached,
so I got notified.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.264
Isn't that illegal?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.092
I don't know, but
he should be arrested.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.920
I meant you reading
employee emails.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.922
Oh, Liam. It's 2021.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.445
Don't be so naive.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.273
Okay, look...
[exhales]

31:24.317 --> 31:26.406
To be continued. Right now,

31:26.449 --> 31:28.277
I have to find a
headhunter of my own

31:28.321 --> 31:30.279
and order him to shoot Blake.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.326
MAN [over P.A.]:
Nurse Anderson to admitting
desk. Nurse Anderson...

31:33.369 --> 31:34.718
You're gonna pay
for this.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.373
Did your presentation
not go well?

31:37.417 --> 31:39.941
Yeah, I heard some groaning,
or was that moaning?

31:39.985 --> 31:41.377
I could get you fired
for this.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.292
For what? You have no proof

31:43.336 --> 31:45.686
that I did anything
to your presentation.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.340
[scoffs]

31:47.383 --> 31:50.299
Or that me and my girlfriend
had sex on your desk.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.519
Hey.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.564
Yeah.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.262
[smacks lips]

31:56.305 --> 31:58.873
Hey, you're still here.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.136
I thought maybe you had already
gone back to New Orleans.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.572
We need to talk.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.619
I know. I'm so sorry.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.450
Okay, look, I never
should have tricked you

32:10.493 --> 32:12.365
with that stupid
scholarship idea.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.454
If you're going
to Tulane,

32:14.497 --> 32:16.064
I will get an apartment
in New Orleans

32:16.108 --> 32:17.500
and we'll make
long distance work.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.809
If you still want to,
which I hope you do.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.681
I actually meant
I needed to talk, but okay.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.422
When you said
our relationship was successful

32:26.466 --> 32:30.122
because we were honest
and open, I...

32:30.165 --> 32:34.300
I realized I wasn't being honest
about what I want, which is

32:34.343 --> 32:36.955
for you to move here
so we can be together.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.695
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

32:38.739 --> 32:40.523
Because I was afraid.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.961
You kept talking
about how expensive it was.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.224
And I mean,
what if you move here

32:45.267 --> 32:47.661
and take on all that debt,
and then we break up?

32:47.704 --> 32:49.358
I would feel awful.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.013
I'm a big boy, okay? I can make
life decisions on my own

32:52.057 --> 32:53.710
and live with the consequences.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.103
But I'm not gonna
make a-a big

32:55.147 --> 32:56.496
life decision

32:56.539 --> 32:58.019
without having
all of the information.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.630
Well, that's smart.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.502
You're smart.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.983
No wonder you got
into law school.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.899
I'm going to Western Atlanta.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.945
You are?

33:10.989 --> 33:14.383
They're both great schools,
but all things being equal,

33:14.427 --> 33:16.516
of course I want to come here.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.345
But you know you can't actually
take that scholarship,

33:19.388 --> 33:21.303
because it really is fake.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.565
[laughs]
Yeah.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.089
Yeah, actually,

33:24.132 --> 33:26.700
your-your friend Culhane
offered me a good loan, so...

33:26.743 --> 33:30.660
But for the record, Sam,
uh, I was afraid, too.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.358
I didn't want
to take a student loan

33:32.401 --> 33:35.013
if moving here
and starting a whole new life

33:35.056 --> 33:37.450
in your city was
gonna freak you out.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.973
So I guess that

33:39.017 --> 33:41.628
we both needed to see
if we were ready

33:41.671 --> 33:43.630
to commit to something.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.240
And I am.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.764
And I want you here.

33:47.808 --> 33:51.551
Because I really hate
long distance.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.639
Oh, God, me, too.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.162
It's the worst. [laughs]

33:54.206 --> 33:55.772
Come here.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.035
Mmm.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.689
Oh, and-and good news.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.169
There are some great
strip clubs here,

34:01.213 --> 34:04.085
so I can start paying
Culhane back right away.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.609
[laughs]Well, come on.
Let's go celebrate.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.655
Yay.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.529
Mm.

34:17.664 --> 34:18.926
What are you doing?

34:18.969 --> 34:21.407
Oh, don't worry.
I'm expensing this.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.496
Not a stressed-out
soul here.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.845
Well, that's great.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.629
Hey, I'm just curious.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.197
Is yoga something you'll be
doing at your next job?

34:29.241 --> 34:31.678
You know, the one
you hired the headhunter for?

34:31.721 --> 34:32.766
Look, I asked him
to meet me in the lobby

34:32.809 --> 34:34.333
so he wouldn't be disruptive.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.117
Oh, wow, wow,
that's very considerate of you,

34:36.161 --> 34:37.684
but really not the point.

34:37.727 --> 34:40.469
Well, getting comfortable and
coasting is not really my style.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.080
Did you think
I was gonna be here forever?

34:42.123 --> 34:43.777
Well, I don't know. I mean,
I figured you'd last more

34:43.820 --> 34:46.693
than a-a short week, but I don't
even know why I'm shocked.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.825
I mean, it's just like you

34:48.869 --> 34:50.262
to put yourself first,
because Blake Carrington

34:50.305 --> 34:52.133
only cares
about Blake Carrington

34:52.177 --> 34:54.179
as Blake Carrington already
knows. You have tunnel vision.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.616
That's how you crawl
your way to the top, by

34:56.659 --> 34:58.705
betraying and ignoring
everybody else.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.750
How exactly did I betray you?

35:00.794 --> 35:02.622
I came in and cut costs
like you asked.

35:02.665 --> 35:03.797
Where's the appreciation?

35:03.840 --> 35:06.060
You know what? You are right.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.758
You did show me one way
to cut dead weight.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.412
I hope you have
a great headhunter,

35:10.456 --> 35:12.153
because you are fired!

35:12.197 --> 35:13.198
[gong sounds]

35:19.160 --> 35:20.118
MAN:
I'll go grab his car for him.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.120
She said the only person

35:22.163 --> 35:23.773
I cared about was me,

35:23.817 --> 35:26.080
and that I would do whatever
it takes to be on top.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.082
Well, I remember when
that was a good thing.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.823
There's a reason

35:29.866 --> 35:31.955
that headhunter already
found me two opportunities.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.001
Hmm, well, perhaps,

35:34.044 --> 35:35.829
like smoking
and catcalling,

35:35.872 --> 35:38.614
raw ambition is
no longer in vogue, sir.

35:38.658 --> 35:39.920
Tell me the truth, Anders.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.835
Do I have tunnel vision?

35:41.878 --> 35:43.053
Because I think I've
done as good a job

35:43.097 --> 35:44.446
as possible at balancing

35:44.490 --> 35:46.013
being a captain of industry

35:46.056 --> 35:47.536
and... and everything else.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.538
Well, you did
miss the birth

35:49.582 --> 35:52.062
of all of your children
because of work,

35:52.106 --> 35:55.022
you had sex with your
son-in-law's mother

35:55.065 --> 35:57.416
to close a deal for C.A.,

35:57.459 --> 35:59.809
and most recently,
you went to Moldavia

35:59.853 --> 36:02.551
when it might have suited
your marriage better

36:02.595 --> 36:04.162
to have stayed home.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.815
But that's just my opinion, sir.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.817
I'm sorry I asked.

36:07.861 --> 36:11.125
Perhaps Fallon feels like gin--

36:11.169 --> 36:14.041
extremely unappreciated.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.045
Based on nothing more
than the amazing sex

36:18.088 --> 36:20.178
we had on Bailey's desk

36:20.221 --> 36:23.224
and what just went down between
the sheets, I'm happy to say

36:23.268 --> 36:25.139
seems like the old Adam's back.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.186
Apparently, a little
skullduggery goes a long way.

36:28.229 --> 36:32.059
You know, my family has always
moved on to the next big thing,

36:32.102 --> 36:35.236
and I've been left behind.
Thank you

36:35.280 --> 36:36.150
for your patience.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.804
I know what I want now,

36:37.847 --> 36:39.806
and I'm going after it.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.200
Especially now
that Bailey's out of the way.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.288
She's gone?

36:43.331 --> 36:44.811
Fired at the end of the day.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.334
Yup, apparently,

36:46.378 --> 36:49.076
her reaction highlighted
her inability

36:49.119 --> 36:51.252
to remain calm during a crisis.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.472
Her professionalism
was called into question.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.430
Hmm, I don't
know about that.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.693
Some of that stuff seemed
pretty professional to me.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.652
This is just the beginning.

36:59.695 --> 37:03.221
I'm gonna control that hospital
and everything in it, Kirby.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.788
There's promising research
happening.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.747
What do you mean?
The value

37:07.790 --> 37:10.489
of what might be discovered
is in the billions

37:10.532 --> 37:12.447
for whoever has
their name on it.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.842
[whispering]:
And I'm gonna make sure
that my name is on it.

37:15.885 --> 37:19.846
Which means that Fallon
and Blake...

37:19.889 --> 37:21.369
they won't be the only two
in this family

37:21.413 --> 37:22.718
that people respect.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.642
What are these for?

37:33.686 --> 37:34.774
They're gorgeous.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.950
I wish I could say nothing.

37:36.993 --> 37:40.127
They're my way of thanking you
for opening up my eyes.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.390
Well, you're certainly welcome.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.349
Fallon's next.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.176
She's not getting flowers.
You deserve more.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.397
You know, the problem
with tunnel vision is

37:49.441 --> 37:52.531
you can't see it
until you're out of the tunnel.

37:52.574 --> 37:56.317
I put my needs and my wants
before yours too many times,

37:56.361 --> 37:58.232
and that's why our marriage
collapsed.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.148
I shouldn't have had an affair.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.802
I'm surprised that you
put up with me

38:02.845 --> 38:04.064
as long as you did.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.414
I've lost enough already.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.416
I don't want to lose any more
of what really matters.

38:10.636 --> 38:14.161
This is all I've wanted to hear
for a long time, Blake.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.256
The Bank of Culhane.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.780
Has a nice ring to it.Mm-hmm.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.087
Thank you for loaning Ryan
the money.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.828
It might have saved
our relationship.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.004
Yours and mine,
or yours and Ryan's?

38:31.047 --> 38:32.440
[laughs]

38:32.484 --> 38:34.268
I'm just happy I could help.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.357
Though when you finally
start spending your money,

38:36.401 --> 38:38.316
you pick the most
boring way to do it.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.013
The money's not gonna change me.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.189
Although I did love
the presidential suite.

38:42.232 --> 38:43.930
Remote controlled blinds?

38:43.973 --> 38:45.366
[imitates explosion]
Who knew?

38:45.410 --> 38:48.326
Again, everyone.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.371
Wait, what?Ah.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.156
I thought the bidding
got too high.It did.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.376
But I emailed the guy who won,

38:55.420 --> 38:58.858
and I made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.468
I think there might
still be hope for you.[laughs]

39:00.512 --> 39:02.383
I made a deal with myself.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.429
For every good thing I do,
like Ryan's loan,

39:04.472 --> 39:06.474
I'm gonna treat myself.

39:06.518 --> 39:08.563
And I am fully on board
with that idea.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.000
And right now,

39:11.044 --> 39:13.481
I'm going for a drive.

39:13.525 --> 39:16.179
Now, that is not boring.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.793
Culhane.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.490
Michael Culhane.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.318
[laughs]

39:25.450 --> 39:27.452
[tires screeching]

39:35.590 --> 39:39.638
Well, I'm busy, so whatever
it is, please make it quick.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.248
I'm sorry.

39:41.291 --> 39:44.556
I was being selfish when
I hired that headhunter.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.428
But I respect what you're
doing at Fallon Unlimited,

39:47.472 --> 39:49.822
and I want to stay around
and help you make your company

39:49.865 --> 39:52.477
into something even greater.

39:52.520 --> 39:56.872
Well, my company is already
pretty great.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.309
Yeah, I know that.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.529
That's why I added the "er".

40:03.096 --> 40:07.100
I want a second chance,
and I'm asking as your father.

40:07.143 --> 40:08.797
As much as I thought
you needed me,

40:08.841 --> 40:12.932
I... I need you.

40:12.975 --> 40:15.456
And I need this job.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.502
The 3,000-square-foot
penthouse at La Mirage

40:17.545 --> 40:19.678
is starting to feel cramped.

40:19.721 --> 40:23.029
Are you sure you're ready...

40:23.072 --> 40:24.334
to work for me?

40:24.378 --> 40:26.902
I mean, I know it's
the more PC thing to say

40:26.946 --> 40:28.774
that we'd be working
together as a team,

40:28.817 --> 40:32.517
but at the end of the day,
I am your boss.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.867
I'll be fine with it.
Trust me.
Mm-hmm.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.437
I love what you've done
with the décor.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.440
It's very, um... pink.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.572
Is that a girl boss thing?

40:44.616 --> 40:47.532
No. It's an Alexis thing.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.274
I liked it better
the way it was.

40:51.318 --> 40:55.975
Well, the way it was is over.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.544
I guess you'll have
to get used to the way it is.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.336
[groans]

41:11.599 --> 41:13.906
[elevator bell dings]

41:16.648 --> 41:18.301
Cristal.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.566
Are you okay?
I'm...

41:21.609 --> 41:25.439
I'm fine.
It's nothing.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.616
Well, fainting straightaway
is not nothing.

41:28.660 --> 41:31.706
I've just been nauseous
and tired lately.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.447
It's probably a bug.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.538
Please don't mention this
to Blake.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.192
He'll just worry,

41:39.235 --> 41:40.715
and there's nothing
to be concerned about.

41:40.759 --> 41:43.022
As you wish.
