02:18.306 --> 02:20.225
"Yotsuya Kwaidan"

03:20.493 --> 03:22.245
- Good morning.
- Hi.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.820
Kosuke's behind us.

03:59.699 --> 04:04.077
Sorry about last night.
I was held up.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.164
I'll make it up to you.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.622
Hello.

04:48.539 --> 04:52.669
"Kosuke Hasegawa - In"

05:00.802 --> 05:02.303
Hello.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.581
- How do I look?
- Mean.

06:12.832 --> 06:17.003
"Yotsuya Kwaidan, The Play"

06:28.473 --> 06:30.391
<i>5 and 4. Odd number.</i>

06:52.705 --> 06:55.249
<i>Dealer rolls! Place your bets!</i>

07:01.130 --> 07:02.423
Hello, Sir.

07:06.302 --> 07:07.512
Yes?

07:09.055 --> 07:13.518
What's that scent on you?

07:14.685 --> 07:16.854
Is it blood?

07:32.662 --> 07:35.540
<i>Borrowed money should
be returned.</i>

07:36.958 --> 07:41.962
<i>But some people
forget to pay it back.</i>

07:41.963 --> 07:47.301
<i>A loan from a blind masseur
is taken lightly.</i>

07:53.641 --> 07:59.397
I'm not a noble samurai
like yourself, Sir.

08:01.274 --> 08:02.733
For me,

08:03.860 --> 08:06.529
I can only depend on money.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.994
True, I am a samurai.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.663
But without money or rank

08:16.664 --> 08:20.585
I feel like I'm in a dungeon
without sunlight.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.636
Mister.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.308
How about a good time?

08:36.976 --> 08:38.811
Not a bad idea...

08:45.318 --> 08:47.445
Look at your debauched face.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.322
Asshole!

08:51.240 --> 08:53.284
Give it back to me!

08:53.993 --> 08:55.535
Lovebirds.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.539
It's mine.
A patron gave it to me!

09:01.209 --> 09:03.794
<i>Give it back to me!</i>

09:07.215 --> 09:08.508
Sir.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.765
Who's your new woman?

09:49.507 --> 09:52.509
When I'm with you

09:52.510 --> 09:55.471
time passes in the
blink of an eye.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.518
Leaving so soon?

10:03.479 --> 10:07.148
If I'm not home before Father

10:07.149 --> 10:10.278
he'll never let me
leave the house.

10:18.828 --> 10:20.413
If you had a comb

10:21.664 --> 10:23.249
like this...

10:27.670 --> 10:30.214
I'd always be with you, Iwa.

11:02.705 --> 11:06.833
My daughter wants to
marry you but

11:06.834 --> 11:10.129
I won't leave my family fortune
to you.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.720
Since her mother died

11:18.638 --> 11:22.265
I've raised her on my own.

11:22.266 --> 11:27.521
<i>I won't let a sleazy man like you
have my precious daughter.</i>

11:33.569 --> 11:37.990
<i>Take this money and forget Iwa.</i>

11:38.991 --> 11:41.494
I know all about you.

11:43.329 --> 11:48.584
Did years of unemployment
rot your morals?

11:48.793 --> 11:52.254
You and your shifty
friends con people.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.715
You'd even kill for money!

11:54.924 --> 11:56.884
How despicable!

11:58.803 --> 12:03.808
You give samurai a bad name.
Shame on you!

12:07.728 --> 12:09.313
What amuses you?

12:22.952 --> 12:26.163
You think I'm worth so little.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.458
You're incorrigible.

12:37.717 --> 12:39.468
You brute!

12:49.186 --> 12:52.981
Nobody's listening to
your nonsense!

12:52.982 --> 12:55.151
You useless old fool!

12:57.319 --> 12:59.029
How dare you...

13:05.035 --> 13:06.662
Ah...

14:15.815 --> 14:17.399
You'll catch a cold.

14:27.952 --> 14:31.789
Is your father still missing?

14:34.124 --> 14:37.586
It's already been a month.

14:42.550 --> 14:46.846
Poor Iwa.
You must feel miserable.

14:48.097 --> 14:49.640
Oh, lemon.

14:50.766 --> 14:55.144
I'm sure he's out
there somewhere.

14:55.145 --> 15:00.067
Maybe he got held up
by some important business.

15:04.947 --> 15:09.158
It breaks my heart to see
you so sad.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.952
But don't worry.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.915
I'll ask around for you.

15:18.502 --> 15:19.920
lemon.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.925
When I'm with you...

15:26.135 --> 15:28.470
I feel that I can cope.

15:33.684 --> 15:37.813
I wish I was with
you all the time.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.483
Iwa.

15:43.652 --> 15:48.449
Do you mean that we should
get married?

15:52.161 --> 15:53.162
Yes.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.625
That is my wish too.

15:58.626 --> 16:02.171
But your father hasn't
given his approval.

16:04.465 --> 16:05.716
Right?

16:07.801 --> 16:13.264
As he has no sons to
continue the family's line,

16:13.265 --> 16:16.143
he should be happy to have a
successor.

16:18.562 --> 16:24.359
Being the head of this household
might help you

16:24.360 --> 16:27.363
find employment.

17:56.410 --> 17:59.620
<i>Starting a family...</i>

17:59.621 --> 18:01.915
<i>Is that happiness?</i>

18:04.334 --> 18:06.253
I guess so.

18:08.464 --> 18:09.965
For you, too?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.261
Maybe.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.308
What's funny?

18:32.071 --> 18:33.530
You'll catch a cold.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.658
You'll catch a cold.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.492
This is unbearable.

19:22.913 --> 19:25.082
I'm not worthy of you...

19:29.670 --> 19:31.964
I'm so sorry.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.969
Oh, God, sorry!

19:37.970 --> 19:40.388
Sorry. Are you OK?

19:40.389 --> 19:41.765
I'm fine.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.146
Let's have a break.

19:48.147 --> 19:49.648
<i>It's break time!</i>

20:02.619 --> 20:04.245
- Here.
- Thanks.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.290
You OK?

20:07.499 --> 20:11.587
Kayo, can you fill in for me?

20:15.048 --> 20:15.883
But...

20:16.383 --> 20:17.551
Please.

20:19.761 --> 20:20.637
Okay.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.810
I'll do my best.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.706
Iwa.

20:50.459 --> 20:54.838
I know that you resent me.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.509
That's not true.

21:01.803 --> 21:05.473
Since we got together
2 years ago

21:05.474 --> 21:10.062
I've never brought
any money home.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.441
"I gave you a baby boy."

21:15.442 --> 21:19.738
"Even though I've been sick
since his birth"

21:21.782 --> 21:24.909
"I'm the one who works"

21:24.910 --> 21:28.038
"and prepares the meals."

21:33.543 --> 21:35.837
It's written all over your face.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.550
<i>You in here?</i>

21:44.388 --> 21:47.641
Here, it'll relieve the pain.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.726
No, thanks.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.942
He kicked you
even though it's a rehearsal!

21:58.235 --> 21:59.403
Never mind.

22:01.613 --> 22:03.740
What do you see in him?

22:06.493 --> 22:08.578
How are your wife and kid?

22:09.621 --> 22:10.831
Good?

22:11.748 --> 22:15.418
We have our ups and downs...

22:15.419 --> 22:17.336
You look happy.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.839
Don't be deceived.

22:26.138 --> 22:29.725
Men are easily tempted.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.895
Just to be clear.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.024
Married men don't interest me.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.776
You're direct.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.405
Keep your mind on the job.

22:51.371 --> 22:56.668
Sometimes I wish that the play
was my real life.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.214
I don't.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.821
This is unbearable.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.826
I'm not worthy of you!

23:33.246 --> 23:35.082
I'm so sorry!

24:07.948 --> 24:11.660
Women really are something...

24:15.372 --> 24:18.999
So you know all the lines!

24:19.000 --> 24:21.377
Yes, just in case...

24:21.378 --> 24:23.713
You're so prepared!

24:45.318 --> 24:46.986
Thanks for that.

24:46.987 --> 24:48.655
Is your back OK?

24:49.739 --> 24:51.241
I'll get changed.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.078
You alright?

24:56.329 --> 24:57.581
Yes.

25:47.672 --> 25:52.135
I believe you're Mr.
lemon Tamiya.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.098
And you are...?

25:58.475 --> 26:03.270
I'm a nanny at Mr. Ito's
residence for his girl, Ume.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.023
My name is Maki.

26:06.483 --> 26:11.363
Would you accompany me
to the Ito mansion?

26:14.533 --> 26:19.620
It would be in your interests
if you came.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.373
Master Kihei Ito

26:22.457 --> 26:26.795
wishes to speak with you
in person.

28:10.482 --> 28:15.861
I'll leave it to you,
Grandfather.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.155
Alright.

28:20.575 --> 28:23.578
Ume, I'm happy for you.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.710
Sir, step this way please.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.398
Thank you for agreeing to come.

28:52.691 --> 28:56.402
I apologize for bringing
you here like this.

28:56.403 --> 28:58.863
What can I do for you?

29:00.990 --> 29:06.120
What a shame a good
samurai like you isn't employed!

29:06.121 --> 29:09.457
I can tell that
you're a good samurai.

29:11.084 --> 29:15.463
I'd like to propose that you
become part of the Ito family.

29:18.174 --> 29:23.012
I wonder if you'd agree to be
Ume's husband.

29:29.853 --> 29:35.607
But I have a wife and a child.

29:35.608 --> 29:41.113
Besides Ms. Ume appears
to be quite young.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.782
She's sixteen.

29:46.161 --> 29:49.789
With clue respect I must decline
your proposition.

29:51.374 --> 29:56.504
I find your honesty
very gallant.

29:57.714 --> 30:02.384
Ume is certainly
childish at times

30:02.385 --> 30:06.055
but at 16 she's mature enough
to be a woman.

30:08.725 --> 30:12.561
<i>She saw you one day
when she was in town</i>

30:12.562 --> 30:17.107
<i>and she can't shake you
from her mind.</i>

30:17.108 --> 30:20.027
<i>She lost her parents
at a young age.</i>

30:20.028 --> 30:25.949
<i>She's so dear to me I'd
do anything for her.</i>

30:25.950 --> 30:29.828
<i>But Ume has never asked
anything of me.</i>

30:29.829 --> 30:32.081
Until now.

30:32.957 --> 30:36.211
Until she fell in love.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.381
Love...

30:41.049 --> 30:42.091
Yes.

30:46.763 --> 30:49.681
I know your position,

30:49.682 --> 30:53.436
but please consider my offer.

31:28.429 --> 31:29.430
<i>Mr. Tamiya.</i>

31:30.640 --> 31:35.103
<i>You deserve a life
worthy of a samurai.</i>

31:38.022 --> 31:40.816
If you marry my Ume

31:40.817 --> 31:44.778
it'll be easier to
find employment.

31:44.779 --> 31:47.699
Your wife will understand.

31:49.242 --> 31:55.289
A samurai's wife would
encourage her husband's career.

31:55.290 --> 31:59.210
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

32:01.129 --> 32:05.216
<i>We've figured out a plan</i>

32:06.134 --> 32:09.429
to make things go smoothly.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.017
Let us handle it.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.474
<i>May I come in?</i>

33:03.191 --> 33:07.111
Miyuki, I'm clone for the day.

33:08.738 --> 33:10.740
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.206
See you.

33:21.292 --> 33:22.502
Miyuki.

33:24.295 --> 33:28.424
I'd love to have a talk with you
one clay.

33:30.134 --> 33:34.681
I got into acting because I
was inspired by you.

33:39.769 --> 33:40.937
Oh.

33:45.108 --> 33:49.362
You're quite gutsy, aren't you?

33:54.117 --> 33:55.702
Thank you.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.457
I'll be going.

34:16.389 --> 34:17.681
See you.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.185
See you tomorrow.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.367
It's OK now.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.717
<i>Miyuki, are you in here?</i>

34:54.761 --> 34:57.138
The car's here.

36:39.949 --> 36:42.076
"Miyuki calling"

39:07.596 --> 39:08.889
What's wrong?

39:54.685 --> 39:55.853
Hi.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.691
I just came here for
some shirts.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.151
<i>Oh.</i>

40:02.360 --> 40:04.362
You want to shower?

40:06.572 --> 40:08.074
Why so nice?

40:09.367 --> 40:11.327
Coz you dropped by, Kosuke.

40:13.788 --> 40:16.082
We have a day off next week.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.709
Got any plans?

40:20.044 --> 40:21.921
I'm going to Izu.

40:22.588 --> 40:23.506
Work?

40:24.882 --> 40:29.428
I was invited by some
producers I worked with once.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.938
As soon as I'm done
I'll come by.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.274
I'll be waiting.

40:44.944 --> 40:48.239
That's a lot of pasta...!

40:49.532 --> 40:50.908
<i>Want some?</i>

41:20.563 --> 41:23.607
"Home Pregnancy Test"

41:41.834 --> 41:45.171
"Negative"

42:04.607 --> 42:06.442
Welcome home.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.992
How do you feel?

42:18.245 --> 42:19.955
lemon...

42:29.215 --> 42:31.050
I wish I was...

42:34.845 --> 42:36.639
It's not decided yet but

42:37.890 --> 42:40.392
I might be offered
an official position.

42:43.270 --> 42:45.523
Is that true?

42:49.860 --> 42:52.071
If Father was here...

42:53.781 --> 42:56.408
he would have been happy!

43:21.308 --> 43:26.146
You can wear this when
you report for duty.

43:29.108 --> 43:34.612
It's our family crest,
a ying-yang insignia.

43:34.613 --> 43:37.283
Where there's light
there's shadow.

43:38.450 --> 43:40.869
Where there's shadow
there's light.

43:43.622 --> 43:45.416
All elements in the universe

43:46.625 --> 43:48.836
throughout eternity

43:49.795 --> 43:53.382
have a light and a shady side.

44:13.902 --> 44:15.237
What is it?

44:20.367 --> 44:21.910
There, there.

44:31.754 --> 44:36.258
lemon, he's smiling
at his daddy!

44:39.678 --> 44:41.263
Dear boy!

45:00.658 --> 45:05.579
Ms. Maki came all this way
to bring me a gift.

45:14.088 --> 45:16.131
Please thank her.

45:19.176 --> 45:24.889
Let me express my thanks
for my husband's good fortune.

45:24.890 --> 45:28.602
I appreciate
Master Ito's generosity.

45:30.479 --> 45:35.817
I hope he'll continue
to support lemon's career.

45:35.818 --> 45:37.985
Thank you so much.

45:37.986 --> 45:39.863
I'll pass it on.

45:40.698 --> 45:42.865
It appears that

45:42.866 --> 45:48.705
your husband is preoccupied
with your health.

45:48.706 --> 45:52.917
So Master Ito acquired
some medicine abroad and

45:52.918 --> 45:56.587
he wanted to get it
to you soon.

45:56.588 --> 46:00.092
Have one packet a day.

46:03.762 --> 46:07.640
I don't deserve
such expensive medicine...

46:07.641 --> 46:11.144
Not to worry.
It's for your husband.

46:11.145 --> 46:15.398
We hope he'll perform to the
best of his ability on the job.

46:15.399 --> 46:20.696
And that depends on
your good health.

46:25.826 --> 46:29.204
Thank you very much.

46:30.664 --> 46:36.253
Iwa, we have no reason
to reject their generosity.

46:44.136 --> 46:46.972
I don't know how to thank you.

46:48.807 --> 46:52.644
Look at that darling baby!

47:36.188 --> 47:38.481
What did you give her?

47:38.482 --> 47:42.986
Don't worry, it won't kill her.

47:45.489 --> 47:46.615
But...

47:52.496 --> 47:54.248
Gentlemen usually

47:55.499 --> 47:58.752
despise things that are ugly.

48:13.517 --> 48:15.227
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

48:16.061 --> 48:18.856
There, there.

48:25.153 --> 48:27.697
Does it still hurt?

48:27.698 --> 48:29.575
There, there...

48:37.165 --> 48:39.001
<i>Welcome home.</i>

48:46.800 --> 48:51.597
I nursed Ichinosuke
a while ago but

48:52.973 --> 48:54.933
he got sick and threw up.

48:56.310 --> 48:59.187
I wonder if it's the medicine...

49:00.439 --> 49:05.319
Are you saying that
it's poison?

49:06.403 --> 49:08.280
No, I wouldn't!

49:09.907 --> 49:15.662
I've taken the medicine
for 2 days now but...

49:17.539 --> 49:18.665
What?

49:21.835 --> 49:26.548
I guess it'll start
working soon.

49:29.009 --> 49:31.136
It was so expensive!

49:31.929 --> 49:34.556
You have to finish it or

49:36.308 --> 49:38.936
it'd be disrespectful
to Master Ito.

49:44.358 --> 49:50.738
It is generous of you to
be so concerned for my health.

49:50.739 --> 49:54.742
You troubled yourself
to get me medicine.

49:54.743 --> 49:56.954
I'm so fortunate.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.667
Tell Master Ito

50:02.751 --> 50:06.588
how grateful I am
for his kindness.

51:26.752 --> 51:30.422
<i>That was the last packet.</i>

52:15.133 --> 52:18.136
<i>Thanks, everyone.
Let's finish for the day!</i>

52:19.930 --> 52:22.306
<i>We'll have a clay off tomorrow.</i>

52:22.307 --> 52:27.062
<i>And we'll resume rehearsals
at 2 pm in two days.</i>

52:43.078 --> 52:44.371
Kayo.

52:46.164 --> 52:51.419
Kosuke will stay over tonight so
I won't need a ride tomorrow.

52:51.628 --> 52:52.420
OK.

52:53.171 --> 52:56.924
If there's any change
let me know.

52:56.925 --> 53:00.594
In that case I'll call you.

53:00.595 --> 53:01.596
Good.

53:57.694 --> 54:01.323
<i>Sorry, I'm still in Izu.</i>

54:04.117 --> 54:05.202
Oh.

54:06.828 --> 54:08.580
It's not your fault.

54:14.753 --> 54:15.962
<i>Bye.</i>

54:19.925 --> 54:21.301
See you...

54:46.576 --> 54:49.204
<i>Me or her...?</i>

54:49.996 --> 54:51.373
<i>I love you.</i>

54:52.666 --> 54:54.334
If it's true

54:55.252 --> 54:57.003
marry me.

54:59.089 --> 55:03.801
We'll get married and
move to America.

55:03.802 --> 55:07.888
There's no reason for you
to work as an actor.

55:07.889 --> 55:11.893
You can help Dad
with his business.

55:13.270 --> 55:17.898
He owns many restaurants
and buildings.

55:17.899 --> 55:20.110
Acting is all I've known

55:20.986 --> 55:23.280
since childhood.

55:28.994 --> 55:30.495
I won't...

55:33.081 --> 55:35.583
I won't let Miyuki
have you back.

57:22.899 --> 57:24.484
About lemon...

57:29.656 --> 57:32.283
What would have made him happy?

57:34.119 --> 57:36.496
<i>Nothing.</i>

57:37.163 --> 57:38.373
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

57:54.848 --> 57:56.640
Hey, you.

57:56.641 --> 58:00.437
I'll have to ask you
to come a little sooner.

58:05.233 --> 58:06.818
Sorry.

58:09.154 --> 58:11.448
It's his fault.

58:15.702 --> 58:17.662
Uh...

58:20.707 --> 58:22.667
Uh...

58:51.362 --> 58:53.323
Uh...

01:02:15.608 --> 01:02:16.859
Mivuki!

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:34.085
What's going on...?

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:41.718
Mivuki?

01:02:51.144 --> 01:02:52.478
Hi, there.

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:12.123
I'm not worthy of you...

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:16.210
I'm so sorry.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:19.088
<i>What?</i>

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.967
I'm not worthy of you...

01:03:23.885 --> 01:03:26.888
I'm so sorry.

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:33.770
What are you saying?

01:03:41.194 --> 01:03:42.653
Let's sleep.

01:03:44.906 --> 01:03:46.157
You need a doctor.

01:03:49.786 --> 01:03:51.037
Let's go.

01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:58.628
I can sleep it off.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:04.967
No, you can't...

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.305
We're going.

01:04:10.306 --> 01:04:12.683
I can't find our baby!

01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:17.021
I know he's in there.

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:24.362
I looked all over but
I couldn't find him.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:28.032
What...?

01:04:29.659 --> 01:04:33.246
You know how important this play
is for us.

01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:37.834
We need some sleep.

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:49.220
Or do you want to

01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:51.388
make love?

01:04:51.389 --> 01:04:52.431
That's enough!

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:04.235
I'm not worthy of you...

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.113
I'm so sorry.

01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:09.156
Go away...

01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:13.869
I'm not worthy of you...

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:16.162
No, it's OK...

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:18.541
I'm so sorry.

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:23.587
I'm not worthy of you...

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:25.505
Stay away!

01:05:25.506 --> 01:05:27.967
I'm not worthy of you...

01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:29.844
I'm so sorry.

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:48.172
Hello.

01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:51.884
<i>You're early today.</i>

01:07:02.144 --> 01:07:04.354
<i>Listen, everyone.</i>

01:07:04.355 --> 01:07:10.527
We can't find Miyuki
so we'll use an understudy.

01:07:10.528 --> 01:07:13.030
Let's get ready, everyone.

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.032
Fill in for her.

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:17.535
Very well.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.377
Thank you.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:36.387
"Miyuki Goto - Out"

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.682
When I'm with you

01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.644
time passes in the
blink of an eye.

01:07:46.439 --> 01:07:48.441
Leaving so soon?

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:54.571
If I'm not home before Father

01:07:54.572 --> 01:07:58.200
he'll never let me
leave the house.

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:07.460
If you had a comb like this...

01:08:09.962 --> 01:08:12.423
I'd always be with you, Iwa.

01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:50.419
It hurts...

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.924
Oh, God...

01:09:02.098 --> 01:09:03.974
It hurts.

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:12.858
It hurts.

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:11.143
Good evening.

01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:16.190
<i>It's Takuetsu, the masseur.</i>

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.237
<i>Ms. Iwa.</i>

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:27.243
<i>How are you tonight?</i>

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:34.708
It's kind of you to visit but

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:39.421
I'd prefer to be alone
this evening.

01:11:42.049 --> 01:11:47.304
lemon will be home soon
and he'll want his supper.

01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:50.766
Mr. lemon?

01:11:52.518 --> 01:11:57.106
I wonder if he'll
come home tonight.

01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:10.953
Takuetsu...?

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:18.252
Ms. Iwa!

01:12:20.546 --> 01:12:22.589
How dare you! Stop it!

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:29.345
I've desired you, Ms. Iwa

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:31.639
for a long time.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.183
Let me go!

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:51.659
Beautiful Ms. Iwa...

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.662
I said let go!

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.000
Forget your husband.

01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:00.753
You see, Mr. lemon...

01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:05.423
He knows about this.

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:08.093
He said I can have you.

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:18.270
I guess lemon wanted
a better life.

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:21.398
Samurai can be...

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:27.321
<i>quite heartless.</i>

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:32.325
<i>For a better life</i>

01:13:32.326 --> 01:13:38.290
<i>he sacrificed you and the baby.</i>

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.293
He'll live in a mansion

01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:47.883
with a pretty, young girl
as his wife.

01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:54.723
Ah..

01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:01.814
Ms. Iwa...

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:04.608
Ms. Iwa!

01:14:07.528 --> 01:14:09.363
Ms. Iwa.

01:14:11.573 --> 01:14:13.242
Ms. Iwa...

01:14:50.112 --> 01:14:52.448
<i>Filthy animals.</i>

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:58.787
I caught you fornicating.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:17.931
Sir, this isn't what
you promised!

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.258
lemon!

01:16:02.935 --> 01:16:04.269
Masseur.

01:16:04.937 --> 01:16:06.063
I saw you.

01:16:06.939 --> 01:16:11.360
You tricked a married woman
into a shameless affair.

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:18.616
And you're a wife who
let herself be tricked.

01:16:18.617 --> 01:16:20.702
It's immoral.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.747
I had to punish you both.

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:09.973
lemon.

01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:32.120
You're mine and mine only.

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:44.674
What's wrong?

01:22:28.028 --> 01:22:29.029
Ume.

01:22:55.889 --> 01:22:56.932
Iwa...

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:05.564
You've done me wrong.

01:23:05.565 --> 01:23:07.609
lemon.

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:11.780
You demon!

01:23:18.078 --> 01:23:18.787
<i>“Me!</i>

01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:23.792
There's nothing to worry about.

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:33.385
We figured out a plan

01:23:34.761 --> 01:23:38.723
to make things go smoothly.

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:23.661
You're so undignified...

01:25:33.505 --> 01:25:37.842
I think you've already
been in hell, lemon.

01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:02.909
For the pain

01:26:09.207 --> 01:26:11.626
you inflicted on me!

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:06.723
What the hell...!

01:27:09.225 --> 01:27:11.935
There wasn't even a breeze.

01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:13.897
It flew from over there.

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:18.318
OK, where is his head?

01:27:19.277 --> 01:27:20.612
Well sir...

01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:23.114
We can't find it.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.743
What do you mean?

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:35.960
Thank you.

OK, that's good.

Come downstairs.

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:00.193

No. He worries me.

01:28:10.787 --> 01:28:12.121
Do you know anything?

01:28:12.956 --> 01:28:14.666
