WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:02.322
Over 68 million Americans

00:02.324 --> 00:05.258
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.626
If danger strikes,

00:06.628 --> 00:09.062
the FBI's International Response Team

00:09.064 --> 00:11.498
is called into action.

00:35.791 --> 00:38.358
So you remember how I
promised to show you something

00:38.360 --> 00:39.959
that'd just take your breath away?

00:39.961 --> 00:42.060
Mm-hmm. I do.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.664
And... breath taken.

00:50.205 --> 00:53.940
Sorry. This might be my sister.
She's coming to visit me.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.654
_

00:58.380 --> 01:00.680
Hey. What's up?

01:00.682 --> 01:03.783
Hey, so I missed my connecting flight.

01:03.785 --> 01:06.986
So now it looks like I won't
get there till tomorrow night.

01:06.988 --> 01:09.823
- Sorry.
- Uh, that's all right.

01:09.825 --> 01:13.793
I, um, needed to study
for this final anyway.

01:13.795 --> 01:16.095
Uh, you hooking up with your R.A.

01:16.097 --> 01:18.298
is not what Mom and Dad had
in mind for a semester abroad.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.335
Uh... look, can I call you back later?

01:22.337 --> 01:23.903
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:23.905 --> 01:26.406
Gotta go. Love you to death.

01:26.408 --> 01:27.974
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye.

01:27.976 --> 01:30.944
Is everything okay?

01:30.946 --> 01:33.146
Perfect.

01:33.148 --> 01:34.747
Now where were we?

01:46.895 --> 01:49.462
Oh, son of a bitch.

01:49.464 --> 01:50.964
What? What's wrong?

01:50.966 --> 01:52.665
Poliziotto.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.400
I'm gonna get in so much trouble.

01:54.402 --> 01:55.935
No, you won't. It's all right.

01:55.937 --> 01:57.670
Just get out your I.D.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.647
Aah! Aah!

02:15.223 --> 02:16.523
Don't do this!

02:16.525 --> 02:20.193
Please! Please!

02:21.530 --> 02:23.530
Gina Price, 19, of Bedford, Iowa,

02:23.532 --> 02:26.165
and Peyton Moss, 21, of
New Brunswick, New Jersey,

02:26.167 --> 02:27.174
were both attending

02:27.199 --> 02:29.035
Hallridge University's
Overseas Studies Program

02:29.037 --> 02:30.203
in Florence, Italy.

02:30.205 --> 02:32.138
Both bodies were found this morning

02:32.140 --> 02:33.239
on the outskirts of the city.

02:33.241 --> 02:34.541
Now both were shot,

02:34.543 --> 02:37.277
but Gina's body suffered
postmortem mutilation,

02:37.279 --> 02:38.611
and as you can see,

02:38.613 --> 02:41.147
she was redressed and
restaged at the location.

02:41.149 --> 02:43.449
Shell casings were left
behind at the scene,

02:43.451 --> 02:47.358
and ballistics verify the
murder weapon is a .22 Beretta,

02:47.383 --> 02:49.455
but not just any .22 Beretta.

02:49.457 --> 02:52.025
You see this unique
firing pin impression?

02:52.027 --> 02:55.161
This impression was cut
into each spent shell casing.

02:55.163 --> 02:57.430
Coupled with a distinct
M.O., it confirms

02:57.432 --> 02:59.732
that Peyton and Gina
are the latest victims

02:59.734 --> 03:03.503
in the most notorious
killer in Italian history.

03:03.505 --> 03:06.205
They call him "Il Mostro di Firenze."

03:06.207 --> 03:07.941
The Monster of Florence.

03:07.943 --> 03:10.710
And that's why our U.S.
Ambassador and authorities

03:10.712 --> 03:13.913
from Italy's Special
Investigation's Task Force

03:13.915 --> 03:16.883
have requested the I.R.T.'s
immediate assistance

03:16.885 --> 03:18.251
with the investigation.

03:18.253 --> 03:20.220
I thought they caught this
"Monster of Florence" guy

03:20.245 --> 03:22.306
- 20 years ago.
- Yeah, you would've thought so, right?

03:22.331 --> 03:23.723
But, no, I remember this case.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.692
It was just like the
Zodiac, and it's unsolved.

03:25.694 --> 03:29.362
Yeah, well, "Il Mostro," he
killed 14 people, 7 couples.

03:29.364 --> 03:32.031
He ambushed them while they
were having sex in parked cars

03:32.033 --> 03:34.300
or at campsites in and
around the hills of Florence.

03:34.302 --> 03:37.036
His M.O. was always the
same... Shoot both victims

03:37.038 --> 03:40.039
and then take the extra
time to mutilate the female.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.240
Yeah, but it's odd, isn't it?

03:41.242 --> 03:43.476
I mean, what drives a
power-assertive sociopath

03:43.478 --> 03:45.511
into such a prolonged period of silence?

03:45.513 --> 03:46.646
Yeah, I'm not sure,

03:46.648 --> 03:48.548
but, uh, these long,
cooling off periods,

03:48.550 --> 03:50.883
while they're unusual,
they're not unprecedented.

03:50.885 --> 03:53.186
And as for why this so-called "Monster"

03:53.188 --> 03:55.221
has risen after all these years,

03:55.223 --> 03:57.590
I'd say if he remains true to form,

03:57.592 --> 03:59.225
he's gonna tell us himself.

03:59.227 --> 04:00.627
You really think so?

04:00.629 --> 04:04.497
On top of everything else,
this UNSUB is statement-driven,

04:04.499 --> 04:05.732
so it won't be too long

04:05.734 --> 04:08.401
before he reaches out
to local law enforcements

04:08.403 --> 04:10.737
to taunt them with the reason he's back

04:10.739 --> 04:13.106
and how he'll fool them all over again.

04:13.108 --> 04:15.608
Only this time,

04:15.610 --> 04:17.976
we're gonna be there to stop him.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.392
_

04:22.083 --> 04:23.983
Mi scusi, signorina.

04:23.985 --> 04:27.487
You are Miss Alison
Price, Gina's sister, yes?

04:27.489 --> 04:29.422
Yes, I am.

04:29.424 --> 04:34.260
I am Commissario Galterio Conte,
the lead investigator for GIDES.

04:34.262 --> 04:36.095
I've already answered so many questions.

04:36.097 --> 04:38.831
I don't know how I can help you guys.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.500
I really need to...

04:42.937 --> 04:47.006
Why did I miss that damn flight?

04:47.008 --> 04:48.307
If only I'd gotten here sooner,

04:48.309 --> 04:49.676
she never would've been out there.

04:49.678 --> 04:53.413
This is not your fault.

04:53.415 --> 04:54.614
Do you understand?

04:54.616 --> 04:56.582
Mm-hmm.

04:58.586 --> 05:02.422
Oh, my God. It can't be Gina.

05:02.424 --> 05:06.292
Stop! Don't do this!

05:06.294 --> 05:07.794
Please!

05:07.796 --> 05:10.196
No!

05:10.198 --> 05:13.199
Stop! Don't do this!

05:13.201 --> 05:15.868
Please!

05:18.139 --> 05:21.140
Stop! Don't do this!

05:21.142 --> 05:23.409
Please!

05:24.446 --> 05:25.845
No!

05:25.847 --> 05:28.981
Stop! Don't do this!

05:28.983 --> 05:32.051
Please!

05:32.053 --> 05:35.088
No! Stop...

05:43.164 --> 05:44.664
_

06:19.930 --> 06:22.397
"When I had journeyed
half of our life's way,

06:22.399 --> 06:25.434
"I found myself within
a shadowed forest,

06:25.436 --> 06:28.870
for I had lost the path
that does not stray."

06:28.872 --> 06:30.972
Dante Alighieri.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.408
Agent Garrett, the fact this this killer

06:33.410 --> 06:35.444
has remained at large for so long

06:35.446 --> 06:37.612
is a profound embarrassment to us.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.915
So I want you all to
know how much we here

06:39.917 --> 06:42.184
at the Special Investigations Task Force

06:42.186 --> 06:45.921
appreciate the FBI's assistance
with this investigation.

06:45.923 --> 06:47.589
Thank you, Commissario Conte.

06:47.591 --> 06:49.658
We're here to help in any way we can.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.028
Now as was true

06:53.030 --> 06:56.298
in each of the seven
previous sets of murders,

06:56.300 --> 06:58.200
Il Mostro returned via parcel

06:58.202 --> 07:00.335
what he took from the female victim.

07:00.337 --> 07:05.006
In this case, her reproductive organs.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.243
Along with them, he left this...

07:10.514 --> 07:14.916
His intended message to us was
nearly lost in all the blood.

07:14.918 --> 07:17.853
"Dear Police, my hibernation is over."

07:17.855 --> 07:19.855
"Judgment is upon you now.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.991
"With the waning crescent
moon, I will kill again

07:22.993 --> 07:25.427
"the ones who contaminate each other.

07:25.429 --> 07:28.497
"And I will not stop
until the Arno runs red

07:28.499 --> 07:29.931
"like the Phlegethon.

07:29.933 --> 07:32.767
I am the Monster. Fear me."

07:32.769 --> 07:33.969
Ma non capisco.

07:33.971 --> 07:35.904
The Arno is the river
running through Florence,

07:35.906 --> 07:37.873
but what is the "Phlegethon?"

07:37.875 --> 07:41.309
It's the river of scalding
blood that boils the souls of men

07:41.311 --> 07:43.678
in the Seventh Circle
of Dante's "Inferno."

07:43.680 --> 07:46.181
Ah. I should know this...

07:46.183 --> 07:48.617
given Dante Alighieri
was born in this city.

07:48.619 --> 07:50.952
Jack, the "waning crescent moon"
begins the day after tomorrow.

07:50.954 --> 07:52.320
So he's giving us a 48-hour window,

07:52.322 --> 07:53.655
but it also means he's accelerated

07:53.657 --> 07:55.591
his cooling-off period even more.

07:55.616 --> 07:58.560
Yeah. In the past, he's
waited months, sometimes years,

07:58.562 --> 07:59.761
between murders.

07:59.763 --> 08:02.697
Well, taken all together,
his crimes span decades.

08:02.699 --> 08:06.234
And he is clearly intelligent,
methodical, mission-oriented.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.005
We're probably dealing
with a mature male

08:10.007 --> 08:13.141
who is highly educated,
financially secure,

08:13.143 --> 08:17.312
and he's probably grappling
with his own fear of mortality.

08:17.314 --> 08:19.648
Commissario, right now, I'd like

08:19.650 --> 08:21.950
to walk through the crime
scene with Agent Simmons,

08:21.952 --> 08:24.986
while Agent Jarvis reviews
each of the autopsy reports.

08:24.988 --> 08:26.922
Also, I think Agent Seger here

08:26.924 --> 08:30.425
can help expedite going
through all these case files.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.994
Maybe together, we can
uncover "the road not taken."

08:32.996 --> 08:35.263
Si. I couldn't agree with you more.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.154
Displacement of gravel suggests

08:40.179 --> 08:42.785
that the assailant could have
arrived in a separate vehicle, but

08:42.811 --> 08:45.817
there's not enough here to lift
any tire impressions from it.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.542
So let's run through this.

08:47.544 --> 08:50.512
Peyton and Gina drive up here and park.

08:50.514 --> 08:52.013
They start fooling around.

08:52.015 --> 08:53.548
Right, which means they're distracted,

08:53.550 --> 08:56.142
so maybe they don't notice the
approaching vehicle at first.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.153
Maybe they think it's a cop...

08:58.155 --> 09:02.624
who gets out with a flashlight,
which keeps them in the dark.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.689
All right, so then he
moves to the driver's side,

09:04.714 --> 09:07.429
blinding Peyton with
his flashlight, he fires.

09:07.431 --> 09:08.663
One shot. He's very efficient.

09:08.665 --> 09:13.168
But this allows Gina time
to escape, or try to anyway.

09:13.170 --> 09:15.136
But the UNSUB knows

09:15.138 --> 09:18.240
that she's not going anywhere.

09:18.242 --> 09:20.075
Yeah, because he's so
proficient with a gun

09:20.077 --> 09:21.743
that it's become part of his pathology.

09:21.745 --> 09:23.712
A twisted game
of cat-and-mouse.

09:23.714 --> 09:25.046
Exactly.

09:25.048 --> 09:27.249
But do you know what strikes
me so much about this UNSUB?

09:27.251 --> 09:29.559
His level of comfort here. Yeah.

09:29.584 --> 09:31.086
He fires multiple shots.

09:31.088 --> 09:33.788
He then takes his time mutilating

09:33.790 --> 09:35.690
and then restaging Gina Price's body.

09:35.692 --> 09:39.160
Because he knew no one would
hear the shots or screams,

09:39.162 --> 09:40.528
not in this location,

09:40.530 --> 09:43.431
or in the locations of
the other 14 murders.

09:43.433 --> 09:46.134
Thing is, if this UNSUB is preferential,

09:46.136 --> 09:49.070
if he's choosing these
couples specifically,

09:49.072 --> 09:51.840
just having a night of fun,

09:51.842 --> 09:53.926
then how in the world does
he know that they'll end up

09:53.951 --> 09:55.580
in a location that
suits him so perfectly?

09:55.635 --> 09:56.635
Good question.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.894
Here are the rest of the
reports you need, Agent Jarvis.

10:12.896 --> 10:15.314
Now Medico Legale Graziani
is busy at the moment,

10:15.339 --> 10:17.198
but he has asked me to help
you translate the documents.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.867
Great. Thank you. What's your name?

10:18.869 --> 10:21.169
Marco. I'm an assistant coroner.

10:21.171 --> 10:23.205
Did you assist in these autopsies?

10:23.230 --> 10:25.907
Si. Che brutalità.

10:25.909 --> 10:27.676
I've never seen anything
like this before.

10:27.678 --> 10:29.477
I wish I could say the same.

10:29.479 --> 10:30.779
It's all too familiar,

10:30.781 --> 10:34.416
especially the way he chose
to degrade and objectify Gina.

10:34.418 --> 10:35.650
It seems personal.

10:35.652 --> 10:38.586
- You think he knew this woman?
- He didn't have to,

10:38.588 --> 10:41.556
but she could've been a
surrogate for his rage.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.924
Well, unfortunately,

10:42.926 --> 10:45.794
we did not discover anything
that stood out in her autopsy,

10:45.796 --> 10:47.262
nor that of her companion.

10:47.264 --> 10:49.531
It's always something, Marco.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.933
You ever heard of something

10:51.935 --> 10:53.702
called Locard's exchange principle?

10:53.704 --> 10:56.121
- No.
- Basically, it says that

10:56.146 --> 10:57.639
while a criminal will inevitably

10:57.641 --> 10:59.974
take something away from a crime scene,

10:59.976 --> 11:01.571
he will always leave something behind.

11:01.596 --> 11:04.746
And usually that something
is found on these bodies.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.247
Did you determine the type of blade

11:06.249 --> 11:08.383
that was used in these
sharp-force injuries?

11:08.385 --> 11:10.452
They made a mold a few years ago,

11:10.454 --> 11:14.489
and it appears they thought it
was some kind of specialty knife

11:14.491 --> 11:16.691
used by hunters or fishermen.

11:16.693 --> 11:18.993
Not a surgical blade? Scalpel?

11:18.995 --> 11:20.343
Not according to his reports.

11:20.368 --> 11:24.065
Well, I think we may need to
revisit that conclusion, Marco.

11:24.067 --> 11:27.102
Take a look.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.003
Clean, distinct cuts.

11:29.005 --> 11:32.340
But notice how these
dissections evolve over time?

11:32.342 --> 11:34.476
Yes, almost as if the technique

11:34.478 --> 11:36.745
is going from beginner to expert.

11:36.747 --> 11:39.080
To someone who's diminished by age,

11:39.082 --> 11:42.450
or maybe someone that just
hasn't practiced in a while.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.952
Tell you what,

11:43.954 --> 11:47.822
if I were a betting woman, which I am,

11:47.824 --> 11:51.760
I would bet the house that
this Monster of Florence

11:51.762 --> 11:55.130
started killing in med school,
probably became a surgeon,

11:55.132 --> 11:57.399
and now he's finding that the joints

11:57.401 --> 12:01.102
in his gifted, little hands
are starting to stiffen up.

12:01.104 --> 12:02.570
Maybe arthritis.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.607
Now you see why this case is

12:05.609 --> 12:09.110
the longest and most expensive
criminal investigation

12:09.112 --> 12:10.311
in Italy's history.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.568
Yes, indeed, I do.

12:12.570 --> 12:15.006
You know, it sort of
feels like somebody crossed

12:15.031 --> 12:16.618
the JFK Assassination with the Zodiac.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.786
Si.

12:17.788 --> 12:19.921
Conspiracy theories have
long been flooding in

12:19.923 --> 12:21.990
to fill the void of suspicion.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.926
I'm particularly amused by the
one about the Satanic cult...

12:24.928 --> 12:26.895
The Order of the Red Rose.

12:26.897 --> 12:28.196
That's weird.

12:28.198 --> 12:31.285
I just found something in
this case file. Check this out.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.401
It's a memo, dated back in 1993,

12:33.403 --> 12:35.136
from your state prosecutor's office.

12:35.138 --> 12:39.040
It describes a commissioned
report on Il Mostro

12:39.042 --> 12:42.076
- prepared by the BAU.
- The BAU?

12:42.078 --> 12:45.113
I wasn't aware the FBI had been
involved in this case before.

12:45.115 --> 12:46.714
- Neither was I.
- Is there a copy of the report?

12:46.716 --> 12:49.484
No, but I do have someone I can call.

12:51.588 --> 12:54.155
- Hey, Clara. What do you need?
- Hey, Monty,

12:54.157 --> 12:56.758
I've been digging through
some old case files here,

12:56.760 --> 12:58.426
and I came across a reference

12:58.428 --> 13:01.196
to a profile prepared
by the BAU back in 1993.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.997
- Really?
- I don't know, Monty.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.433
You're usually very
thorough on backgrounds.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.669
- How'd you miss this?
- Calling me out there, Seger?

13:07.671 --> 13:09.708
I'm just saying, could've saved us

13:09.733 --> 13:11.573
a whole lot of valuable time
if we knew there was already

13:11.575 --> 13:13.274
a report on this UNSUB to work with.

13:13.276 --> 13:14.742
Uh, this is crazy,

13:14.744 --> 13:18.947
but there's no digital record
of this at all, anywhere.

13:18.949 --> 13:20.229
Do you think this is a case of...

13:20.254 --> 13:22.627
"Yesterday's technology, tomorrow!"

13:22.652 --> 13:26.050
I'm pretty sure all the reports
and records of the early '90s

13:26.075 --> 13:27.555
are still being reviewed and digitized,

13:27.557 --> 13:28.823
which means that this guy's

13:28.825 --> 13:30.725
gotta go old school with the
Dewey Decimal on this one.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.728
Thanks, Monty. The clock is
really ticking on this one.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.131
Il Mostro has promised to strike
again in less than 36 hours.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.566
I'll hit you back A.S.A.P.

13:45.809 --> 13:47.375
Luv, it is getting on.

13:47.377 --> 13:48.676
And need I remind you

13:48.678 --> 13:51.446
of our rather thoughtful
dinner reservations I've made?

13:51.448 --> 13:53.715
Oh, you are such the thoughtful one.

13:53.717 --> 13:56.885
And I have been remiss in
demonstrating my appreciation

13:56.887 --> 13:59.320
of your attention to my needs.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.189
Yeah, I may have expressed
a certain enthusiasm

14:01.191 --> 14:02.991
- for this scenario, but...
- Well, what's wrong?

14:02.993 --> 14:05.727
Well, to be bloody honest,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

14:05.729 --> 14:09.464
You know, I feel utterly safe
in your warm and loving arms.

14:09.466 --> 14:11.499
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

14:11.501 --> 14:14.002
Oh, my. I believe that we've caught

14:14.004 --> 14:16.471
the attention of park authorities.

14:16.473 --> 14:19.507
Brilliant. Just brilliant.

14:19.509 --> 14:21.843
Sorry. You just have
to excuse our, um...

14:24.214 --> 14:25.613
No!

14:25.615 --> 14:29.517
Aah!

14:29.519 --> 14:34.589
No!

14:53.555 --> 14:56.322
Hey, Rossi, you got a second?
I gotta ask you something.

14:56.324 --> 14:57.350
Sure, Monty. What do you got?

14:57.375 --> 14:59.397
I've been trying to track down
this missing subject profile

14:59.422 --> 15:01.277
that was commissioned
about 20 years ago.

15:01.279 --> 15:03.646
And as far as I can tell, the
paper trail leads back to you.

15:03.648 --> 15:06.182
Oh, it does, does it?
Well, I'm intrigued.

15:06.184 --> 15:08.368
Do you remember being a
part of developing a profile

15:08.370 --> 15:11.821
for a foreign subject known
as the "Monster of Florence"?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.316
Actually, I do.

15:13.341 --> 15:15.491
Really? Great.

15:15.493 --> 15:17.769
You wouldn't happen to have
a copy just laying around

15:17.794 --> 15:18.956
after 20 years, would you?

15:18.981 --> 15:20.206
If you have a few minutes,

15:20.231 --> 15:23.600
I might be able to dig
up my old case notes.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.418
You know, having to go over these notes

15:25.420 --> 15:26.886
after all these years,

15:26.888 --> 15:30.707
I remember how much
this UNSUB reminded me

15:30.709 --> 15:33.493
of David Berkowitz, the
so-called "Son of Sam."

15:33.495 --> 15:35.728
Right. The Bronx, back in '77.

15:35.730 --> 15:39.332
Berkowitz also targeted couples in cars.

15:39.334 --> 15:40.833
Before they called him the "Son of Sam,"

15:40.835 --> 15:44.921
the NYPD referred to him
as the ".44 Caliber Killer."

15:44.923 --> 15:45.989
So similar traits

15:45.991 --> 15:48.524
of mission-orientation
and power-assertion.

15:48.526 --> 15:49.792
And don't forget narcissism.

15:49.794 --> 15:51.694
Yeah, but neither the "Son
of Sam" nor the "Zodiac"

15:51.696 --> 15:54.831
performed postmortem mutilations
on his female victims.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.700
Correct, and that's how
Il Mostro revealed himself

15:57.702 --> 15:59.335
to be guilt-motivated.

15:59.337 --> 16:02.639
You see, I-I think
he's native to Florence.

16:02.641 --> 16:04.107
Certainly born in Italy.

16:04.109 --> 16:06.209
And those Catholic roots play a part

16:06.234 --> 16:10.646
in his sense of grace versus guilt,

16:10.648 --> 16:13.950
particularly in terms of
expressions of sexuality.

16:13.952 --> 16:16.569
So you think this aggressive
overkill on the female bodies

16:16.571 --> 16:19.739
might be his desire to
punish the feminine form

16:19.741 --> 16:21.341
for inspiring temptation?

16:21.343 --> 16:24.427
In his twisted, emotional logic, yes.

16:24.429 --> 16:27.180
Rossi, there's an aspect
to this that seems like

16:27.182 --> 16:28.598
a God-complex playing out,

16:28.600 --> 16:30.483
and that would jibe with
some evidence we have

16:30.485 --> 16:32.452
that this guy may be a surgeon.

16:32.454 --> 16:35.071
Interesting. I recall, at the time,

16:35.073 --> 16:39.108
investigators were more
focused on hunters or butchers.

16:39.110 --> 16:42.111
There was even a local
chef that was questioned.

16:42.113 --> 16:44.080
Yeah, those were several
of the unfortunate turns

16:44.082 --> 16:46.582
that the investigation
took over the last 20 years.

16:46.584 --> 16:48.842
Well, yeah, not to
mention the years wasted

16:48.867 --> 16:50.770
on victimologies that tried to explain

16:50.795 --> 16:52.966
the UNSUB's preferential selection.

16:52.991 --> 16:53.731
Wait. Hold on.

16:53.756 --> 16:56.125
Are you saying you don't
think he's preferential?

16:56.127 --> 16:59.262
Matt, the breakthrough
I had with this profile

16:59.264 --> 17:00.930
came in the moment I realized

17:00.932 --> 17:03.966
that this UNSUB did
not choose his victims.

17:03.968 --> 17:07.369
He chooses his victims' locations.

17:07.372 --> 17:08.771
Yeah, but it that's true,

17:08.772 --> 17:11.674
since all of these murders were
committed on public properties,

17:11.675 --> 17:13.159
each one would have to hold

17:13.161 --> 17:16.325
some sort of significant
personal meaning to this guy.

17:16.349 --> 17:18.665
That's right. If you could
find that through-line

17:18.666 --> 17:20.383
that runs from location to location,

17:20.385 --> 17:24.954
well, that'll take you
right to the Monster himself.

17:24.955 --> 17:28.074
Rossi, it says here that there
is an assistant state prosecutor

17:28.076 --> 17:29.509
by the name of Carmela Tafani,

17:29.511 --> 17:31.444
and she was the one who
received your report?

17:31.446 --> 17:33.012
Yes. I remember her.

17:33.014 --> 17:34.864
But no further action was taken.

17:34.866 --> 17:36.282
Do you think she buried it?

17:36.284 --> 17:38.718
No. That would surprise me.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.520
Il Mostro has stuck again.

17:40.522 --> 17:42.188
I'm told this time tourists.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.457
Gunned down in I Giardini Paradiso.

17:44.459 --> 17:47.360
The cars will be waiting
out front. Andiamo.

17:47.362 --> 17:48.428
Jack, that's 12 hours ahead

17:48.430 --> 17:49.812
of the deadline he threatened us with.

17:49.814 --> 17:52.014
Well, you let me know if I
can help you in any other way.

17:52.016 --> 17:55.485
All right. Your two help
Conte process the scene.

17:55.487 --> 17:58.855
Clara and I are gonna try to
track down this Carmela Tafani

17:58.857 --> 18:00.189
and find out exactly why

18:00.191 --> 18:02.959
Rossi's profile never
saw the light of day.

18:05.130 --> 18:06.562
Grazie.

18:09.267 --> 18:13.369
The victims are Rory Poole, 38,

18:13.371 --> 18:16.739
and Diane Roberts, 34.

18:16.741 --> 18:19.258
They're both from London, England.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.761
M.O. seems consistent.

18:21.794 --> 18:23.094
Takes out the male first,

18:23.119 --> 18:24.918
then he shoots the female
while she's trying to escape.

18:25.266 --> 18:28.768
Butchers her body and then drags
her right back here to stage.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.486
È pazzesco.

18:30.488 --> 18:32.772
I do not see how, besides being lovers,

18:32.774 --> 18:35.458
these two are connected
to the American students

18:35.460 --> 18:36.796
or any of the other couples.

18:36.821 --> 18:38.312
According to that missing BAU profile,

18:38.337 --> 18:39.937
we don't have to worry
about making a connection

18:39.962 --> 18:42.862
between the victims. We have to
find a link between this location

18:42.887 --> 18:44.687
and the locations of the other murders.

18:44.775 --> 18:45.940
I say we also start worrying

18:46.020 --> 18:48.054
about his cooling-off
period dropping to zero.

18:48.056 --> 18:50.623
I mean, this guy's been pretty
consistent with his threats, but...

18:50.625 --> 18:53.192
something has triggered
an accelerated timeline.

18:57.732 --> 19:00.333
Fermo! Fermo!

19:11.913 --> 19:13.179
Chi è?

19:13.181 --> 19:14.814
Carmela Tafani.

19:14.816 --> 19:17.617
Siamo con l'FBI.
Vorremmo parlare con lei.

19:17.619 --> 19:21.888
I have nothing to say to the FBI.

19:21.890 --> 19:26.726
Ms. Tafani, David Rossi at
the BAU suggested we speak.

19:26.728 --> 19:30.029
It's about the Monster of Florence case.

19:31.232 --> 19:33.966
Il Mostro di Firenze.

19:33.968 --> 19:37.069
It is a case I hoped
to never speak of again.

19:37.071 --> 19:39.372
It was the biggest mistake
of my life. Do you think

19:39.374 --> 19:41.541
that's because after
Rossi sent you the profile,

19:41.543 --> 19:45.011
you failed to follow up?

19:45.013 --> 19:48.881
You're here because you
think I covered up evidence?

19:48.883 --> 19:51.150
We're looking for the truth, Ms. Tafani,

19:51.152 --> 19:54.287
so that we can finally
bring a killer to justice.

19:54.289 --> 19:56.240
- The truth?
- Yes.

19:56.265 --> 19:57.557
The truth is

19:57.559 --> 20:01.594
my superiors preferred
to let a killer roam free

20:01.596 --> 20:04.797
rather than to admit a woman was right.

20:04.799 --> 20:06.899
You think that sexism contributed...

20:06.901 --> 20:09.501
Scusi, Agent Garret. I know it.

20:09.526 --> 20:11.197
I was too naive at the time

20:11.222 --> 20:16.209
to... realize that my position
was merely for appearance.

20:16.211 --> 20:17.643
Can you tell us what happened

20:17.645 --> 20:19.679
after Rossi sent you the profile?

20:21.449 --> 20:23.382
Scusi.

20:24.152 --> 20:25.718
David had said to me that

20:25.720 --> 20:29.455
the key was in where
the murders took place.

20:29.457 --> 20:31.991
Each site had a meaning for Il Mostro,

20:31.993 --> 20:33.726
and that is how I found him.

20:33.728 --> 20:37.797
His mother had been a prostitute
who often rendered her services

20:37.799 --> 20:42.969
while her infant son sit quietly
in the backseat of the car.

20:42.971 --> 20:47.273
Of course, he overcame
his humble beginnings,

20:47.275 --> 20:49.842
rose to become a venerated surgeon

20:49.844 --> 20:52.979
appointed to the
Ministry of Public Health.

20:52.981 --> 20:57.178
His name was Dr. Dominico Scarpa.

20:57.203 --> 20:58.834
And you're saying that everyone

20:58.859 --> 21:02.255
from the lead investigator to
the head prosecutor dismissed

21:02.257 --> 21:05.324
this Dr. Dominico
Scarpa's name out of hand?

21:05.326 --> 21:08.160
Yes, each and every one.

21:08.162 --> 21:12.899
And I was reprimanded,
even docked salary

21:12.901 --> 21:15.110
for commissioning the BAU report.

21:15.135 --> 21:17.536
Do you think they were
trying to cover up for him

21:17.538 --> 21:20.063
- or... or somebody close to him?
- At first, I did.

21:20.088 --> 21:24.877
But then I realized it
was really about power,

21:24.879 --> 21:29.515
and I, of the fairer sex, had none.

21:29.517 --> 21:33.419
Did Dr. Scarpa know he
was, at the very lest,

21:33.421 --> 21:35.087
your prime suspect?

21:35.089 --> 21:39.158
Not until I had the
opportunity to charge him.

21:39.160 --> 21:44.363
Not with the murders of
the seven couples, no,

21:44.365 --> 21:48.534
but with the rape of
his own sister, Renata.

21:48.536 --> 21:50.554
You're kidding? When was this?

21:50.579 --> 21:53.839
January, 1994.

21:53.841 --> 21:56.842
Renata had been found
bloodied and beaten

21:56.844 --> 21:59.612
on the side of the road near Calenzano.

21:59.614 --> 22:03.416
The doctors, they documented
her sexual assault,

22:03.418 --> 22:07.019
which she told them had been
carried out by her brother,

22:07.021 --> 22:11.691
whom I formally charged the next week.

22:11.693 --> 22:15.861
But in the end,

22:15.863 --> 22:17.163
I lost the case,

22:17.165 --> 22:20.366
and was summarily fired the next day.

22:20.368 --> 22:22.668
What happened to Dr. Scarpa?

22:22.670 --> 22:24.937
He's killed again, hasn't he?

22:24.939 --> 22:27.073
Il Mostro has claimed the lives

22:27.075 --> 22:29.742
of two American students two nights ago,

22:29.744 --> 22:31.978
and we have reason to believe
he struck again last night.

22:31.980 --> 22:35.548
So any help you can give us in
trying to locate this individual

22:35.550 --> 22:37.850
would be greatly appreciated.

22:46.894 --> 22:51.197
This opens a locker at
the Piazza Santa Croce.

22:51.199 --> 22:56.168
It contains all my notes
and copies of case files.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.871
It is all I can do to help you.

22:58.873 --> 23:01.040
Che Dio sia con voi.

23:02.410 --> 23:04.710
You know, I would never
presume to understand or to know

23:04.712 --> 23:06.512
what it's like to walk
in that woman's shoes,

23:06.514 --> 23:08.414
but I think I understand another reason

23:08.416 --> 23:10.149
why this case haunts her so much.

23:10.151 --> 23:11.187
Why's that?

23:11.212 --> 23:13.019
It's "the one that got away."

23:13.021 --> 23:15.488
We all have one.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.459
So after he was acquitted of rape,

23:20.461 --> 23:22.395
it appears that Dr. Dominico Scarpa

23:22.397 --> 23:24.930
hightailed it right out
of Florence, out of Europe.

23:24.932 --> 23:27.233
What about any run-ins
with law enforcement?

23:27.235 --> 23:28.534
He get arrested again?

23:28.536 --> 23:30.824
No, but, according to
Interpol, the not-so-good doctor

23:30.849 --> 23:32.282
was considered a person of interest

23:32.307 --> 23:34.473
for a few regional
homicide investigations

23:34.475 --> 23:35.708
with the same modus operandi.

23:35.710 --> 23:38.110
- Nothing more than that?
- No. As far as I can tell,

23:38.112 --> 23:40.646
the trail goes cold at
the end of last year.

23:40.648 --> 23:44.517
Um, last known citing was
a condo purchase in Jakarta.

23:44.519 --> 23:46.218
Hold up.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.287
Uh, here's something curious.

23:48.289 --> 23:50.289
Records I got from Rome indicate that

23:50.291 --> 23:53.993
there's an estate property
held by the family trust.

23:53.995 --> 23:56.095
And it's located in Calenzano.

23:56.097 --> 23:58.431
That looks good, Monty. Thanks.

23:58.433 --> 24:00.800
I'll call Conte, have
him send some officers

24:00.802 --> 24:02.935
to meet us there with a search warrant.

24:28.463 --> 24:29.929
Posso aiutarvi?

24:29.931 --> 24:33.532
Siamo con l'FBI. Abbiamo
un decreto di perquisizione.

24:33.534 --> 24:36.502
E vogliamo parlare con il Dottor Scarpa.

24:36.504 --> 24:40.005
Capisco. I understand. Please.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.316
Dominico.

24:54.889 --> 24:56.255
- Dominico.
- Ehi?

24:56.257 --> 24:58.424
La polizia.

25:01.929 --> 25:05.197
Not only the polizia, my dear Lia,

25:05.199 --> 25:07.600
but the FBI.

25:07.602 --> 25:09.135
Extraordinary.

25:09.137 --> 25:12.171
- This isn't a game, Dr. Scarpa.
- No. No, it's no game.

25:12.173 --> 25:15.374
I think you are going to
try to tear my house apart

25:15.376 --> 25:17.817
in a vain effort to find a pistol

25:17.842 --> 25:19.645
and find some surgical tools,

25:19.647 --> 25:22.781
which I can assure you I do
not have in my possession.

25:22.783 --> 25:25.618
Well, we also believe we can
tie you to murder of 14 people,

25:25.620 --> 25:27.973
and after this search, that
number's gonna go up by four.

25:27.998 --> 25:31.824
You have been talking to Signora
Tafani, and she have convinced you

25:31.826 --> 25:35.778
that I am the one and
only Mostro di Firenze.

25:35.803 --> 25:36.829
Are you?

25:36.831 --> 25:39.442
Do I look like a mostro?

25:39.467 --> 25:40.575
Yes.

25:41.769 --> 25:43.302
Women can be so cruel.

25:43.304 --> 25:45.312
Doctor, where were you last night?

25:45.337 --> 25:48.307
You know, if it was not for Carmela,

25:48.309 --> 25:52.178
I would never have to leave
Firenze those many years ago.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.479
It pained me very much,

25:53.481 --> 25:56.515
because Firenze the most
beautiful place on the world.

25:56.517 --> 26:01.620
But when they diagnosed me
with the liver cancer, IV stage,

26:01.622 --> 26:03.722
I decide to come home.

26:03.724 --> 26:07.092
Innuendo and rumor...
They can all go to hell.

26:07.094 --> 26:08.694
Deflecting our question only makes us

26:08.696 --> 26:10.863
more convinced of your guilt.

26:10.865 --> 26:14.066
By the way, how is Carmela?

26:14.068 --> 26:15.434
I am surprised to hear that

26:15.436 --> 26:19.672
she is not completely consumed
by a menagerie of cats.

26:19.674 --> 26:20.973
Is this your way of saying

26:20.975 --> 26:23.093
that you have no alibi
for the night in question?

26:23.118 --> 26:24.468
No, this is my way of saying

26:24.493 --> 26:29.048
I am tired of being persecute
in this witch's hunt.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.416
I am innocent.

26:30.418 --> 26:33.719
And you want to know where I
was last night and what I did.

26:33.721 --> 26:35.721
And two nights before that.

26:35.723 --> 26:40.392
Then I am in good luck,
because both nights in question,

26:40.394 --> 26:42.761
I dined alone at Forcella D'oro.

26:42.763 --> 26:45.764
The people there can verify
my whereabouts if you like.

26:45.766 --> 26:47.652
- Go, ask them.
- Maybe.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.269
So then it's going to
take some time, all right.

26:50.294 --> 26:51.902
Why don't you join me for dinner?

26:51.927 --> 26:53.205
I don't think so.

26:53.207 --> 26:55.207
No, ehi? Peccato.

26:55.209 --> 26:58.177
Signore, it is your loss.

26:58.179 --> 27:01.497
Feel free. Enjoy yourself.

27:01.499 --> 27:04.917
I must get back to my painting.
It's most important, huh?

27:11.692 --> 27:13.892
Si. Posso.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.396
What did you find?

27:17.398 --> 27:19.031
Nothing.

27:19.033 --> 27:20.499
Yeah, he's certainly smart enough

27:20.501 --> 27:22.301
to not bring his bad
habits home with him.

27:22.303 --> 27:26.605
Perhaps you are putting too
much faith in this woman Tafani.

27:26.607 --> 27:29.642
It has nothing to do with
faith, Commissario Conte.

27:29.644 --> 27:33.767
Let's regroup, see what Simmons
and Mae were able to find out.

27:34.415 --> 27:38.017
I'm pretty sure we're not
done with this Dr. Scarpa.

28:00.488 --> 28:01.754
No!

28:02.209 --> 28:04.743
Stop! Don't do this!

28:04.745 --> 28:06.245
Please! No!

28:16.209 --> 28:18.686
Dr. Scarpagave us permission
to examine his medical records,

28:18.711 --> 28:20.922
and it turns out he was
not lying about the cancer.

28:21.259 --> 28:22.424
His doctors have given him

28:22.426 --> 28:23.759
anywhere from six
months to a year to live.

28:23.761 --> 28:25.561
Well, that's consistent
with our profile.

28:25.563 --> 28:27.548
They guy's desperate to
lash out and make his mark

28:27.573 --> 28:28.731
before the clock runs out.

28:28.733 --> 28:30.032
Yeah, but even if you think

28:30.034 --> 28:31.801
he's still got the giddy-up
for multiple homicides,

28:31.803 --> 28:33.536
his alibi is rock solid.

28:33.538 --> 28:36.338
I just got the security camera
footage from La Forcella D'oro,

28:36.340 --> 28:38.674
and both nights, same deal.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.777
When Scarpa dines alone,
he prefers to be by himself.

28:45.149 --> 28:46.916
What is it, Jack? What do you see?

28:46.918 --> 28:49.819
He's not toasting himself.

28:51.055 --> 28:53.122
The son of a bitch is taunting us.

28:53.124 --> 28:56.792
Tafani is right. Scarpa is still
the one behind these murders.

28:56.794 --> 28:58.627
He just must have a partner now.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.012
It's not just a partner, Jack.

29:00.014 --> 29:01.931
I think it's more like
Scarpa's protégé,

29:01.933 --> 29:04.717
somebody he's grooming to take
over for him after he's gone.

29:04.719 --> 29:06.160
That makes sense, but
it wouldn't be easy

29:06.185 --> 29:08.120
for Scarpa to find someone like that.

29:08.122 --> 29:10.039
I mean, the profile of
that kind of individual

29:10.041 --> 29:11.674
would skew towards a fanatical fan.

29:11.676 --> 29:13.709
Yes, it would.

29:13.711 --> 29:16.312
Monty, I need you to
start looking for people

29:16.314 --> 29:19.215
who've demonstrated an
intense interest in this case

29:19.217 --> 29:21.750
over the years, people who've
written books, articles.

29:21.752 --> 29:23.652
Got it. But, you know, this
being a historical case,

29:23.654 --> 29:25.120
that list gonna be pretty damn long.

29:25.122 --> 29:26.722
- Do you best.
- Oh, I will.

29:28.826 --> 29:30.025
What do you have, Mae?

29:30.027 --> 29:31.894
I was actually able
to cast a mikrosil mold

29:31.896 --> 29:35.231
of the blade that was used
to mutilate Diane Roberts.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.166
And I've compared that to a similar mold

29:37.168 --> 29:39.001
that was created 20 years ago.

29:39.003 --> 29:40.169
They match?

29:40.171 --> 29:41.537
To a tee.

29:41.539 --> 29:44.106
It's the same slightly-modified
surgical scalpel.

29:44.108 --> 29:48.344
So this protégé not only has
access to Scarpa's .22 Beretta,

29:48.346 --> 29:50.980
he's using the doctor's
old surgical tools.

29:50.982 --> 29:53.282
Now to me, that speaks
to a level of trust

29:53.284 --> 29:55.651
one might only give to a family member.

29:55.653 --> 29:57.019
Well, that's true,
but as far as we know,

29:57.021 --> 29:58.587
Scarpa doesn't have any
known relatives, does he?

29:58.589 --> 30:01.423
What about his sister Renata?

30:01.425 --> 30:03.792
I mean, what happened to her?

30:03.794 --> 30:05.227
You can't honestly believe

30:05.229 --> 30:06.896
that Renata is part of all this.

30:06.898 --> 30:09.064
Ms. Tafani, I believe
that Scarpa needs something

30:09.066 --> 30:10.432
he's never needed before.

30:10.434 --> 30:14.136
He needs the bond of trust that
can only be found in family.

30:14.138 --> 30:16.405
He would not have
found that with Renata.

30:16.407 --> 30:20.142
He betrayed her! Savagely.

30:20.144 --> 30:21.377
And I failed her.

30:21.379 --> 30:24.647
No. No, you tried to prosecute him.

30:24.649 --> 30:26.148
I lied.

30:26.150 --> 30:29.952
I told her that I could protect her.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.721
By the time Scarpa had
entered the courtroom,

30:32.723 --> 30:35.925
Renata had been smeared
as a drug-addicted,

30:35.927 --> 30:38.060
mentally unstable woman

30:38.062 --> 30:41.363
whose delusions had led to
a false charge against him.

30:41.365 --> 30:43.599
That's not your fault.

30:43.601 --> 30:46.669
As far as I know, Renata left Florence

30:46.671 --> 30:50.539
before the end of the
trial and ran off to Naples,

30:50.541 --> 30:53.008
where I was told

30:53.010 --> 30:55.077
she died later that year.

30:55.079 --> 30:56.312
Suicide?

30:56.314 --> 30:58.747
I did not have the heart to ask.

31:00.384 --> 31:01.717
Ms. Tafani, thank you.

31:01.719 --> 31:03.452
Thank you so much for all of your help.

31:03.454 --> 31:04.620
And I give you my word,

31:04.622 --> 31:06.889
my team and I will do
everything in our power

31:06.891 --> 31:09.258
to bring Scarpa and his
accomplice to justice.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.126
I have been down that rabbit hole.

31:11.128 --> 31:15.965
Buona fortuna, bella. Buona fortuna.

31:17.101 --> 31:19.802
Hey, Monty, I need you to
verify a death certificate for me

31:19.804 --> 31:22.237
for a Renata Scarpa in Naples

31:22.239 --> 31:24.006
around the end of 1994.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.475
Will do. And I'll check for any
other family ties in the region.

31:26.477 --> 31:28.644
Thanks.

31:52.436 --> 31:53.836
Monty, what do you got?

31:53.838 --> 31:56.705
What I got is a death
certificate in Naples, Italy,

31:56.707 --> 31:58.173
for Scarpa's sister Renata.

31:58.175 --> 32:00.809
But that's not the end of
the story, not by a long shot.

32:00.811 --> 32:03.612
Turns out Renata got pregnant
after her brother's rape,

32:03.614 --> 32:05.414
and she died of
complications from an attempt

32:05.416 --> 32:07.483
to self-induce a
late-term abortion.

32:07.485 --> 32:09.651
Damn. That poor girl.

32:09.653 --> 32:12.054
Thing is, the child survived.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.922
It was a boy, born premature,

32:13.924 --> 32:15.491
but he was eventually
transferred to the care

32:15.493 --> 32:18.327
of Scarpa's own mother, who
would have christened him

32:18.329 --> 32:20.829
with the name "Onario Alighieri."

32:20.831 --> 32:23.132
Alighieri? Is that for real?

32:23.134 --> 32:25.000
That's, uh, that's Dante's last name.

32:25.002 --> 32:27.236
Well, yeah, given the abuse of her son,

32:27.238 --> 32:30.172
Scarpa's mother may have
intended it as a cruel joke.

32:30.174 --> 32:31.273
Seems that giving him that name's

32:31.275 --> 32:32.741
the least cruel thing
that she did to him.

32:32.743 --> 32:33.876
From the looks of it,

32:33.878 --> 32:36.045
Onario had development challenges,

32:36.047 --> 32:38.881
most likely due to being
a product of incest,

32:38.883 --> 32:40.249
and it says here that he developed

32:40.251 --> 32:42.418
an early propensity for violence.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.685
Which culminated in

32:43.687 --> 32:46.488
the deliberate drowning
death of a female classmate

32:46.490 --> 32:49.141
when Onario was just 15 years old.

32:49.143 --> 32:52.678
He was sentenced to a youth
detention facility outside Rome.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.365
And he was released just last
year on his 21st birthday.

32:56.367 --> 32:58.200
Agent Montgomery, this list right here,

32:58.202 --> 33:00.002
these are the known aliases for Onario?

33:00.004 --> 33:02.438
Yeah, but I got them from
the criminal database in Rome.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.973
I haven't been ableto
cross-reference themwith Florence yet.

33:04.975 --> 33:08.343
I shall do so now. Scusatemi.

33:08.345 --> 33:09.778
So what we're looking at is

33:09.780 --> 33:12.047
an abused and emotionally abandoned boy

33:12.049 --> 33:15.217
who finds himself tormented
by these innate impulses

33:15.219 --> 33:17.201
- to do harm.
- He doesn't understand them

33:17.226 --> 33:19.054
and he certainly can't control them.

33:19.056 --> 33:21.206
He probably thinks there's
an explanation somewhere

33:21.208 --> 33:22.524
in his family's history.

33:22.526 --> 33:24.626
I say Onario goes to grandma...

33:24.628 --> 33:27.112
Who's all too willing to share
in the gory details, right?

33:27.114 --> 33:29.698
And in discovering these
dark family secrets,

33:29.700 --> 33:32.251
Onario develops some
twisted sense of himself.

33:32.253 --> 33:34.380
And makes him wanna reach
out to his long-lost father,

33:34.405 --> 33:35.456
seeking approval,

33:35.481 --> 33:38.924
because being Il Mostro is not
part of Onario's birthright.

33:38.926 --> 33:41.026
So Scarpa didn't need to find his son.

33:41.028 --> 33:42.511
His son came looking for him.

33:42.513 --> 33:43.979
And since dear old dad is dying,

33:43.981 --> 33:45.747
he sees in his once-forgotten son

33:45.749 --> 33:47.783
the potential for carrying on a legacy.

33:47.785 --> 33:50.557
A way to achieve immortality.

33:50.582 --> 33:52.521
We may have a lead on
one of Onario's aliases...

33:52.523 --> 33:53.889
"Cambia Accorso."

33:53.891 --> 33:56.725
He was cited for disturbing
the peace about two months ago.

33:56.727 --> 34:00.231
And we have an address, a flat
located near Piazza del Duomo.

34:00.256 --> 34:01.114
We're going there now.

34:01.139 --> 34:04.016
Clara and I will got with
Conte to pick up Scarpa.

34:04.018 --> 34:06.952
You two back up the
units taking down Onario.

34:06.954 --> 34:08.252
Jack!

34:08.889 --> 34:10.956
She should be here... Tafani.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.291
She should be standing right next to us

34:12.293 --> 34:13.958
when we walk them down
that hall to book them.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.829
You're right. Go get her.

35:08.933 --> 35:10.365
He's not here.

35:19.109 --> 35:21.577
It's as if he knew we were coming.

35:21.579 --> 35:23.445
How is that possible?

35:39.463 --> 35:41.263
Carmela?

35:55.779 --> 35:59.248
Clara, the Scarpas are gone.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.315
They've got Tafani.

36:00.317 --> 36:01.850
Stay where you are. I'm on my way.

36:29.546 --> 36:33.081
Ah, Agent Seger! How
nice of you to come.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.983
Let her go. Last warning.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.619
No! Gun on the floor!

36:37.621 --> 36:39.988
Now!

36:41.425 --> 36:44.159
Muoviti. Move.

36:44.307 --> 36:45.160
Ah!

36:48.846 --> 36:50.012
There's no escape.

36:50.014 --> 36:52.248
I called for backup already.
You have to know that.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.784
The only way I can save myself

36:54.786 --> 36:57.486
is if I surrender to you unconditional.

36:57.488 --> 36:59.769
Isn't that what you were going to say?

36:59.794 --> 37:01.550
Scarpa, è una cosa...

37:01.575 --> 37:03.859
No! Tafani!

37:03.861 --> 37:05.361
Let her go!

37:05.363 --> 37:07.930
No one is going anywhere.

37:09.834 --> 37:11.428
Hey, Jack, we were right

37:11.453 --> 37:12.975
about Onario reaching out to his father.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.570
Yeah, he's been writing
him letters every week

37:14.595 --> 37:16.038
since he was released from
that youth detention center.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.795
Thing is, all the letters
were returned to him unopened.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.909
His father was completely ignoring him.

37:19.911 --> 37:21.870
Ignored him until Onario began

37:21.895 --> 37:23.279
to emulate his father's crimes, right?

37:23.281 --> 37:24.947
He must've gone as far

37:24.949 --> 37:25.881
as to break into his father's house

37:25.883 --> 37:27.778
and steal the tools of his trade.

37:27.803 --> 37:30.396
Yeah, he broke in last week.
But how did you know that?

37:30.421 --> 37:33.231
Onario left another
box at Scarpa's home.

37:33.256 --> 37:34.710
The letter inside was an invitation

37:34.735 --> 37:38.527
for him to join his son at the
execution of Carmela Tafani.

37:38.529 --> 37:40.036
Clara's at Tafani's.

37:40.061 --> 37:42.594
I know. I'm on my way there now.

37:42.619 --> 37:45.267
Che ne pensi, Papà? Ehi?

37:46.804 --> 37:49.004
Vedi cos'ho fatto per te?

37:49.006 --> 37:52.608
I bring Il Mostro back from dead, yeah?

37:52.610 --> 37:56.946
I bring you both women
who want to punish you,

37:56.948 --> 37:58.948
see you suffer.

37:58.950 --> 38:03.352
Papà, see what I do, what I am?

38:06.174 --> 38:08.574
Signora Tafani.

38:08.576 --> 38:11.377
You go to your death knowing
you were right about me.

38:11.379 --> 38:13.527
Ma vai all'Inferno!

38:13.566 --> 38:14.430
All'Inferno?

38:14.432 --> 38:17.652
You will beg for the mercy of Hell

38:17.677 --> 38:18.849
before I am finished with you.

38:18.888 --> 38:21.253
Papà, listen to me.

38:21.255 --> 38:24.123
Shoot her, then give me the gun.

38:24.125 --> 38:27.459
Onario! He's not listening.

38:27.461 --> 38:29.880
You did all of this for him,

38:29.905 --> 38:31.330
and he still doesn't see you.

38:31.332 --> 38:33.315
No, no! Shut up! Silenzio!

38:33.317 --> 38:35.901
You don't need him. You know that.

38:35.926 --> 38:38.737
- Onario!
- You don't need your father anymore.

38:38.739 --> 38:39.805
You never did.

38:39.807 --> 38:41.974
Isn't that why you brought us here?

38:41.976 --> 38:45.844
To show him? To show all
of us who you really are?

38:47.148 --> 38:48.881
Verme della terra!

38:48.883 --> 38:50.049
Kill her!

38:50.051 --> 38:51.917
Mi stai esaurendo!

38:51.919 --> 38:56.505
Io sono Il Mostro. I am the Monster.

38:56.507 --> 38:58.841
Your son.

38:58.843 --> 39:02.678
But I am nothing to you.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.148
You are no son of mine.

39:09.378 --> 39:10.944
Aah!

39:12.189 --> 39:13.856
Scarpa!

39:13.858 --> 39:15.658
It's over.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.301
Finalmente.

39:27.738 --> 39:30.005
Andiamo.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.473
Andiamo.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.681
Commissario, hold on.

39:49.706 --> 39:50.592
Si.

39:50.594 --> 39:53.696
This one's hers. Don't
you think she's earned it?

39:56.634 --> 39:59.501
Si. Vero.

39:59.503 --> 40:01.537
Procuratore Tafani...

40:01.539 --> 40:03.339
per favore.

40:03.341 --> 40:05.708
Grazie. Prego.

40:08.012 --> 40:09.812
Andiamo.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.620
Mm. The one that didn't get away.

40:18.622 --> 40:21.857
No. No, he didn't.
