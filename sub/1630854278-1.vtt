01:17.869 --> 01:20.663
Hey, Mr. Nowa. You checked the cash?

01:21.247 --> 01:22.707
We got it.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.377
Five hundred billion.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.088
Good.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.050
Any complaints?

KAKERO CLUB 21ST GENERATION ROYAL LEADER

KAKERO CLUB REFEREE #2
HIKOKICHI YAKO

01:37.931 --> 01:39.974
…will serve as a witness.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.062
Then, let's begin.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.608
I'm going to beat you today.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.985
And I'll be the top of Kakero!

01:52.946 --> 01:58.034
And? What will you be betting on tonight?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.204
Let's see.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.804
Whether a plane will fly
in the sky above us or not.

02:19.389 --> 02:23.726
I'll bet that one will.
The limit will be one hour.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.035
Very well. The hour begins now.

03:17.780 --> 03:22.201
Royal Leader, I'm going to eat your lie.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.748
The aileron's good.

03:26.831 --> 03:29.584
Hurry. They're paying us
ten million for just one hour.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.835
Okay.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.687
Pizza Shuttle. Thanks for waiting!

03:50.605 --> 03:52.899
We didn't order any pizza.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.996
The hour is up.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.669
The number of planes that
crossed the sky above us was zero.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.839
The Royal Leader is the winner.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.218
Royal Leader.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.596
Will we allow this man to live?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.471
I have a message from the Royal Leader.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.433
Mr. Madarame.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.394
There is no value to killing you now.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.065
Your life will be forfeit
to the Royal Leader,

05:16.607 --> 05:21.529
your membership in Kakero Club stripped,

05:22.739 --> 05:24.699
and you will be exiled.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.501
<i>Kakero Club.</i>

05:36.002 --> 05:40.423
<i>This dark organization</i>
<i>was founded in the Azuchi-Momoyama period.</i>

05:43.801 --> 05:49.265
<i>Kageronosuke Kiruma,</i>
<i>the first Royal Leader of Kakero,</i>

05:49.348 --> 05:51.601
<i>served as a referee for gambling lords</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:55.563
<i>and started out punishing those</i>
<i>who avoided paying their debts.</i>

06:03.863 --> 06:05.031
Get out of my way!

06:05.114 --> 06:09.869
<i>He collected payment from every loser,</i>
<i>without regard for rank or power.</i>

06:10.661 --> 06:15.041
<i>His military and financial might</i>
<i>became the foundation of the organization.</i>

06:16.334 --> 06:19.504
<i>The death of Nobonuga</i>
<i>in the Honnoji Incident,</i>

06:20.755 --> 06:23.466
<i>The Sakuradamon Incident</i>
<i>in the Bakumatsu Period…</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:30.932
<i>and even the Showa Era</i>
<i>300-million-yen heist.</i>

06:31.015 --> 06:35.186
<i>These were all no more than</i>
<i>bet collections by this organization.</i>

06:37.438 --> 06:41.400
<i>To this day, Kakero Club continues</i>
<i>to moderate gambling between its members</i>

06:42.068 --> 06:43.736
<i>and ensure the bets are paid.</i>

06:44.487 --> 06:49.492
<i>Their power even allows them to pull</i>
<i>the strings of the national government.</i>

06:51.035 --> 06:55.456
<i>What Baku bet this time was not only</i>
<i>the chance to stand at the top of Kakero</i>

06:55.540 --> 06:59.919
<i>but everything he owned,</i>
<i>including his life.</i>

07:00.002 --> 07:03.256
<i>All that in an attempt</i>
<i>to beat the Royal Leader.</i>

07:14.851 --> 07:20.648
2022 MIKURAJIMA

07:21.941 --> 07:23.609
Alright, put down your cash!

07:23.693 --> 07:25.194
One thousand yen on higher!

07:25.278 --> 07:26.320
Two thousand yen on higher!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.947
-One thousand on lower!
-One thousand on four!

07:28.030 --> 07:29.198
Alright, here we go!

07:32.243 --> 07:36.247
Triple two's! Matching dice
go to the dealer.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.625
I won again. So sorry!

07:39.709 --> 07:42.462
This is my one lucky day a year.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.589
Let's get to the next one!

07:44.672 --> 07:45.882
Alright!

07:45.965 --> 07:50.136
-Place your bets!
-Well, this looks fun!

07:50.219 --> 07:51.637
I wanna play too.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
What are you doing here, kid?

07:55.641 --> 07:58.519
This isn't a game
for little boys. Go play!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.024
One million!

08:03.608 --> 08:04.859
Seriously?

08:05.443 --> 08:08.362
Laugh while you still can.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.366
I'm going…

08:13.618 --> 08:15.286
to eat your lie.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.666
Bring it on.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.214
I'll turn you into fish food.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.758
This will be good!

08:43.856 --> 08:46.025
Two sixes and a four.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.860
That's two million for me.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.322
-Amazing, kid!
-That's… impossible.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.325
-What a win!
-Whoa!

08:54.408 --> 08:55.576
Right?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.252
Even though he's been cheating.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.128
A magnet!

09:08.798 --> 09:13.678
And he's been hiding a magnetic plate
under the sic bo sheet.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.807
<i>He had it set up so that</i>
<i>when he placed the bowl over the sheet,</i>

09:17.890 --> 09:20.226
<i>the magnets made the dice match.</i>

09:21.894 --> 09:24.146
-What the hell?
-You cheater!

09:24.230 --> 09:27.483
<i>So I also hid magnets</i>
<i>inside my wad of bills</i>

09:27.567 --> 09:30.778
<i>and manipulated the dice inside the bowl.</i>

09:35.616 --> 09:37.577
You bastard. You tried to cheat us!

09:37.660 --> 09:39.829
Come here!

09:39.912 --> 09:43.583
As promised, I ate your lie.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.334
But the taste was…

09:49.130 --> 09:52.049
-Sea lettuce ramen.
-Thank you, Hide.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.927
Looks good.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.851
-Thanks for the food!
-How is it?

10:04.145 --> 10:06.647
Hm? Your island life.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.276
All I do is fish all day.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.236
Feels like my brain's rotting.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.574
You should be happy to be alive.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.544
-By the way.
-Hm?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.838
Something's happening
with the Tokyo Kakero.

10:36.177 --> 10:41.015
Someone's aiming to beat the Royal Leader.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.228
Who is it?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.731
A scientist named Ikki Sadakuni.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.193
He discovered a groundbreaking way
to mine methane hydrate.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.696
They say he's the most likely
to win a Nobel prize.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.573
Methane hydrate?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.786
<i>-A new energy source to replace oil.</i>
-Professor!

11:02.620 --> 11:05.206
<i>Since it's buried underground</i>
<i>deep in the ocean,</i>

11:05.289 --> 11:08.167
<i>it was believed to be impossible to mine.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:12.838
Sadakuni invested a huge amount
of his personal funds

11:13.422 --> 11:15.883
and conducted
successful experiments on his own

11:15.966 --> 11:18.844
without relying on
the government or businesses.

11:18.928 --> 11:23.015
But after that, there was
an explosion at his lab

11:23.099 --> 11:25.518
and he disappeared from the spotlight.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.107
So, what's a guy like that
doing with Kakero?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.068
That, I don't know.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.822
But they say Sadakuni's fixer,
who was supporting him,

11:37.905 --> 11:40.741
was working to get him into Kakero.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.994
It's been three years
since you fled Tokyo.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.082
Kakero looks a bit different now.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.216
You're not going back to Tokyo, are you?

12:00.719 --> 12:02.304
You know.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.016
I don't want to surrender to anyone.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.314
This time, for real…

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
I'll take him on.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.114
How? You're not even a member of Kakero.

12:20.906 --> 12:21.991
Besides…

12:23.200 --> 12:27.955
you can't do anything if you're dead.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.379
Thanks for everything.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.897

12:59.028 --> 12:59.904
Reveal.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.825
Mr. Sadakuni wins.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.453
IKKI SADAKUNI

13:07.536 --> 13:10.539
I never thought you'd be a Kakero member.

13:10.623 --> 13:15.419
Why would the Minister of Finance
want to challenge me?

13:16.086 --> 13:20.257
First, to gather enough funds to climb
to the top of the political world.

13:20.883 --> 13:25.179
And the second, to control you.

13:26.305 --> 13:30.059
What you discovered, it's ground-breaking.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.686
It could revolutionize
the world's energy industry.

13:32.770 --> 13:36.065
All the leaders of the world
wanted to monopolize it,

13:36.148 --> 13:39.235
but after the explosion last year,

13:39.318 --> 13:42.029
you disappeared from the public eye.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.784
Weren't you one of those
who wanted the rights?

13:46.867 --> 13:53.123
With your invention,
I could secure every vote.

13:53.207 --> 13:59.713
Today I'm going to beat you,
and your invention will be mine.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.678
Mr. Sadakuni, your turn.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.358
-Sixty million.
-Hundred million.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.236
Reveal.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.615
Straight with ace.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.077
Mr. Sadakuni wins.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.255
Reveal.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
High of six.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.844
Mr. Sadakuni wins.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.151
Twenty million.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.699
All in. Hundred million.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.412
Reveal.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.585
Full house.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.087
Mr. Sadakuni wins.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.464
Are you spying on my hand?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.468
I can't have lost six times in a row.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.720
Referee Mekama, do it again.

15:30.804 --> 15:34.224
First, we must settle the accounts.
You owe 300 million yen.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.187
I can't pay that!
I need the money for the next election!

15:38.687 --> 15:41.565
So, in the end,
that's all you're good for.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.736
Mr. Onodera, you must know
the rules of Kakero Club.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.405
Defying a referee like me is not allowed.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.949
Shut this man up.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.077
Yes, sir. Oi, it's over for you.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.123
You…

15:58.874 --> 16:00.042
You bastard!

16:06.131 --> 16:07.675
In the garden, immediately.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.205
My God.

16:52.302 --> 16:56.598
Hey. Look into my eyes.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.771
What do you see in my eyes?

17:18.996 --> 17:22.332
Mr. Sadakuni, tonight's winnings.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.880
We'll take care of the cleanup.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.340
Thanks for your trouble.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.928
In exchange, I have a request.

17:37.097 --> 17:41.810
Will you make me your designated referee?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.231
I'll think about it.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.842
This takes care of that one.

18:14.593 --> 18:19.765
Killing one small fish isn't enough
to make up for what they've done.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.701
My favorite!

18:40.494 --> 18:43.122
Gotta have this when you're in Yokohama.

18:45.916 --> 18:46.959
No way.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.130
I have no change.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.048
-Thank you.
-Come work with us again.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.258
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.927
Good work today. Cheer up!

18:57.010 --> 18:58.595
-Nice work today.
-Thank you.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.597
Hope to work with you again.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.807
Thanks for today.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.535
IN OPERATION 7777

19:21.618 --> 19:23.954
No way! I won!

19:54.067 --> 19:56.862
You want one?

19:58.488 --> 19:59.573
You sure?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.534
Thanks!

20:09.166 --> 20:13.795
That's good. This is good stuff.
You look like you understand.

20:19.426 --> 20:23.430
Winning a drink from a vending machine,
you're pretty lucky.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.728
Winning a free drink is pretty much
the only luck I can get.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.523
That's pretty self-deprecating.

20:35.734 --> 20:39.279
Because my life is nothing but shit.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.676
-Found you, Kaji!
-Shit!

21:04.012 --> 21:08.475
Come on, Kaji. You can't run anymore.

21:08.558 --> 21:12.020
You're gonna pay back
the 1.5 million you owe us!

21:15.983 --> 21:17.734
-What do you think you're doing?
-Hey!

21:17.818 --> 21:20.320
Don't interrupt people
when they're talking!

21:20.404 --> 21:21.238
What?

21:22.698 --> 21:26.868
You idiot, you only bow and scrape.
You actually owe money.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.745
Huh?

21:28.829 --> 21:31.540
You two wanna get taken down
by that wizard lawyer?

21:31.623 --> 21:34.376
Wizard? Who are you talking about?

21:34.459 --> 21:38.380
This kid's relative.
He caught some company president.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.048
Five years in prison with hard labor.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.551
We won't let you run!

21:50.267 --> 21:52.894
How much do you owe?

21:55.397 --> 21:58.608
Altogether, 2.2 million.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.527
A friend secretly cosigned my name.

22:00.610 --> 22:05.032
You know, you don't have to
pay back an illegal loan.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.452
If you studied even
a little bit of law, you'd know that.

22:08.535 --> 22:12.789
If you don't know the world,
it'll eat you up.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.632
It doesn't matter.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.885
I don't have any dreams or hopes anyway.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.764
It's okay.

22:28.847 --> 22:33.185
That's why you met me like this.
To let you know you still had some luck.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.569
Five million.

22:42.652 --> 22:45.822
Wow! Thank you!

22:50.911 --> 22:53.330
ILLEGAL CASINO OWNER RANKO KURAMA

23:29.741 --> 23:33.537
There's no way the same number
would pop up again.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.854
See! There it is!

23:59.771 --> 24:00.897
You did it.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.984
But you lost.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.319
If you bet on one, it's times 36,

24:06.403 --> 24:08.530
so even if you bet on 37,
you still lost 1,000.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.906
Don't you understand?

24:09.990 --> 24:12.576
A win is a win!

24:16.246 --> 24:21.334
Let's see. Let's put 1,000 yen
on every number but 20 and nine.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.762
-Alright.
-Would you like another drink?

24:33.388 --> 24:34.764
Thanks.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.237
Alright!

24:53.158 --> 24:57.037
That's 36 bets placed on 36 numbers.
It doesn't make sense.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.956
That's why I add more on the next one.

25:00.040 --> 25:05.670
And I'll up my bet
from 1,000 to 10,000 yen.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.687
Okay.

25:51.174 --> 25:55.762
-Oh no. Seriously?
-See? You just lost 350,000 yen!

25:55.845 --> 25:58.848
But nine. it just stopped on nine!

26:02.477 --> 26:04.062
Exchange all this.

26:05.438 --> 26:09.150
-You're gonna start again from one?
-Of course I am!

26:09.901 --> 26:12.988
Hey, there's no way the number nine
will come up again, right?

26:13.071 --> 26:18.535
Yes. Having a number
come up so many times is unlikely.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.996
Right?

26:21.079 --> 26:24.874
See, even the dealer says so.

27:00.869 --> 27:01.995
15 MINUTES AGO

27:02.078 --> 27:03.288
This.

27:03.997 --> 27:08.043
Be on the lookout for when
I start to eat one of these.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.422
When that happens, you bet everything
on the number I haven't chosen.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.099
I like them.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.437
Your truths and lies.
They even make you pick numbers.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.230
Mister, you're…

27:30.732 --> 27:32.150
a liar, aren't you?

27:35.945 --> 27:37.280
I got it!

27:37.364 --> 27:39.824
Baku, he's been guiding the ball!

27:46.831 --> 27:48.500
Yeah!

27:48.583 --> 27:50.126
Nice timing, Kaji!

27:50.210 --> 27:51.836
You're amazing, Baku!

27:51.920 --> 27:53.963
Times 36 is five million!

27:54.047 --> 27:56.049
Five million?

27:56.132 --> 27:57.342
-Wow!
-Incredible!

27:59.052 --> 28:00.804
Wow!

28:02.180 --> 28:04.557
-That's awesome!
-Wow!

28:12.023 --> 28:13.274
Damn it.

28:18.696 --> 28:21.241
-What happened?
-Osugi was set up.

28:21.324 --> 28:24.494
-For how much?
-A little more than five million.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.873
<i>Alright, so now…</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:31.209
<i>Five million.</i>

28:31.292 --> 28:35.422
-The Lie Eater?
-<i>Hey! I got five million!</i>

28:37.465 --> 28:40.593
Well, this is unexpected.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.888
-This has never happened to me!
-Good for you!

28:45.849 --> 28:49.561
Sir, a bonus game is waiting for you.

28:49.644 --> 28:51.354
Kaji, get out of here.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.731
Leave him.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.326
Hey.

29:06.035 --> 29:09.247
I can't leave you here by yourself.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.043
What is the game?

29:14.127 --> 29:16.796
Just guessing whether
the next person to get off

29:16.880 --> 29:20.341
the elevator is a man or woman.
If you lose, give up the money.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.892
I just smelled that perfume.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.562
The person who just got off is a man.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.235
See! I won!

29:41.988 --> 29:43.698
What are you talking about?

29:43.782 --> 29:46.409
No matter how you look at it,
that's a woman.

29:48.286 --> 29:51.623
What the hell! Watch your hands!

29:52.457 --> 29:53.875
Excuse me!

29:53.958 --> 29:55.835
What? That was a man?

29:55.919 --> 29:59.380
You didn't want to hand over the money.
That's why you set me up.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.760
Picking someone who would make it
a loss whether I said man or woman.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.681
You're…

30:10.141 --> 30:11.351
a liar.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.606
As I expected of you.
You haven't gotten rusty at all.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.276
Why did you come back?

30:20.360 --> 30:23.738
Three years and you're still stripped
of your Kakero membership,

30:23.822 --> 30:26.658
and with one order from the Royal Leader,

30:26.741 --> 30:29.077
the Kakero could kill you.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.414
I'll come back again soon.

30:33.998 --> 30:34.958
Let's go.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.715
Baku.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.343
What was that all about?

30:46.761 --> 30:51.349
You know, the Kakero stuff,
and the fact that they'll kill you.

30:52.183 --> 30:56.396
You don't want to know.
That's the kind of world it is.

30:56.479 --> 30:59.732
But Baku, you live
in that world, don't you?

31:01.484 --> 31:02.735
Please.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.030
Let me help you.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.995
Do you think you'll make money
if you're with me?

31:12.078 --> 31:14.497
No, that's not what I…

31:15.874 --> 31:17.959
You took on someone else's debt.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.129
You can't even run away
and leave your friend behind.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.215
Such a nice person
has no talent for gambling.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.633
You can't come with me.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.094
Use that money to get your life back.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.390
See ya.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.319
Alright!

31:44.903 --> 31:48.781
I'm treating myself to a day of luxury!

31:51.993 --> 31:54.078
This is the best!

31:55.371 --> 31:58.249
Herb steamed lobster.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.460
A wagyu steak.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.515
Hello!

32:14.599 --> 32:15.975
-Are you Kaji?
-Yes.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.145
-He's nervous!
-So cute!

32:19.228 --> 32:22.190
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

32:22.273 --> 32:24.025
Go get it!

32:24.108 --> 32:28.029
The world is your oyster! Go get it!

32:39.749 --> 32:42.627
Something doesn't feel right.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.172
Yeah!

32:46.255 --> 32:48.424
Nice timing, Kaji!

32:48.508 --> 32:50.843
You're amazing, Baku!

32:59.894 --> 33:01.187
Damn!

33:14.993 --> 33:15.994
Two million in tokens.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.083
<i>It's your blind.</i>

33:26.587 --> 33:28.631
That'll make it 55 million.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.758
Who is this guy?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.885
He hasn't made a single mistake.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.972
That's Ikki Sadakuni.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.892
Sadakuni.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.354
The one taking down Kakero members?

33:44.272 --> 33:47.692
He probably came here,
knowing this was my place.

33:48.776 --> 33:52.113
Then, he plans to take you on?

33:52.780 --> 33:56.200
Guess we have no choice
but to raise his bet.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.752
Five million.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.135
Five million.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.637
Call.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.891
Five million.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.643
Call.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.734
Five million.

34:30.651 --> 34:33.863
All in. Thirty million.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.451
Reveal.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.830
What the hell?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.467
I'm done.

34:57.887 --> 35:02.266
-I have no more business here.
-This a joke? You're not stopping here.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.269
Someone like you isn't worth my time.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.772
I think I've proven that
to the guys of Kakero.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.003
Ma'am.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.927
What is this about?

35:39.220 --> 35:40.513
I should be asking you.

35:59.240 --> 36:03.161
Hey. Why not take me on?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.960
This is heads.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.212
One match, one million.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.592
Ready?

36:21.721 --> 36:25.766
-I pick tails.
-Ruka, let's go.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.895
Oh no!

36:29.645 --> 36:32.190
It was heads.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.193
You missed your chance.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.406
Wait. You can't tell
if it's heads or tails?

36:41.157 --> 36:43.784
I have no reason to go up against you.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.539
If you want a match against me,

36:49.540 --> 36:53.044
come back when you're
a Kakero member again.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.255
Baku Madarame.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.888
That bastard.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.890
He was totally looking at my hand.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.271
Yeah?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.190
What do you want?

37:14.774 --> 37:15.942
What is it?

37:16.525 --> 37:17.526
What?

37:17.610 --> 37:18.653
What is it?

37:21.739 --> 37:25.618
That Lie Eater guy says
he wants to talk to the mistress.

37:25.701 --> 37:27.078
The Lie Eater?

37:32.041 --> 37:33.376
Hello?

37:35.211 --> 37:37.380
You're pissing me off.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.548
I don't have time to play with you--

37:40.883 --> 37:42.051
What?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.303
What did you just say?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.056
Mistress? What's wrong?

37:49.725 --> 37:50.935
Okay.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.693
He invited me out for a drink.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.584
That's mine.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.008
Who cares about such a small thing?

38:22.091 --> 38:24.927
-Two more of the same.
-Right away.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.226
Why did you call me here?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.274
I'm glad I met you.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.862
What are you talking about?

38:45.364 --> 38:47.533
This has to be fate.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.666
I have a favor to ask.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.046
Only you can do this for me.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.926
Stop strutting around and just say it.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.557
Listen. Don't be shocked.

39:13.559 --> 39:14.935
Okay.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.528
Give me your Kakero membership.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.280
Excuse me?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.657
You shouldn't have it
if you lost to Sadakuni.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.992
Are you kidding me?

39:30.076 --> 39:32.286
I'd never give up such a precious thing.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.997
Then, do you know anyone who would?

39:35.081 --> 39:37.208
Of course not.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.793
Here you are.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.514
There might be one person, actually.

39:52.681 --> 39:53.557
Who?

39:54.350 --> 39:57.770
If you sit down in Nakabori Park,
in Yokohama, looking dumb,

39:57.853 --> 39:59.647
an old man will come up to you.

40:00.314 --> 40:01.690
He'll give up his membership?

40:02.274 --> 40:06.445
However, not a single person
has ever bet against him and won.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.698
Not even one person. You know why?

40:11.325 --> 40:12.785
Huh?

40:19.542 --> 40:21.377
Hey, Kaji!

40:22.294 --> 40:23.879
Baku!

40:23.963 --> 40:26.340
-What are you doing?
-Please!

40:27.341 --> 40:29.343
Let me be by your side.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.470
I'll do whatever you ask.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.683
I don't want money.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.646
My heart was racing
the whole day with you yesterday.

40:41.522 --> 40:45.192
-I thought that's what it is to live. So--
-Okay.

40:46.819 --> 40:47.820
Really?

40:49.280 --> 40:53.451
I, too, realized I need you, Kaji.

40:56.829 --> 41:01.125
Somebody! Somebody help me!

41:04.420 --> 41:07.590
I'm sorry.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.551
Don't kill me!

41:20.394 --> 41:22.938
What a great voice!

41:23.022 --> 41:24.148
TARO KOKONOE

41:24.231 --> 41:28.944
That voice rejuvenates my cells.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.470
What's wrong?

41:54.553 --> 41:56.514
You look down.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.808
Nothing, really.

42:02.686 --> 42:06.732
Young man, do you like gambling?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.944
Yeah, I guess so.

42:10.653 --> 42:15.699
Do you want to play a game in my yard?

42:15.783 --> 42:17.785
You could win big.

42:18.410 --> 42:21.747
What is it? Sounds fun!

42:21.830 --> 42:23.832
Kaji, you should do it.

42:24.959 --> 42:28.629
Well, if you say so, Baku.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.966
Mister, can I come too?

42:33.175 --> 42:37.137
Of course! The more the merrier!

42:37.221 --> 42:39.682
Yeah!

42:39.765 --> 42:43.269
Kaji, you really are a lucky boy.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.150
This your yard?

42:53.821 --> 42:57.575
This forest is my private property.

43:00.494 --> 43:05.207
I have five adorable pets.

43:06.625 --> 43:11.130
You must steal five keys from them
within the time limit.

43:11.714 --> 43:16.135
One of you will put
this timing device on your leg.

43:16.218 --> 43:19.972
If you can remove it
and escape from that gate

43:20.055 --> 43:24.143
before the time is up, you win.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.894
And for your prize…

43:27.855 --> 43:29.440
ten million!

43:29.523 --> 43:31.734
Ten million? Seriously?

43:31.817 --> 43:34.153
What kind of pets do you have?

43:34.236 --> 43:36.530
Nothing like lions and tigers, right?

43:38.115 --> 43:39.617
Of course not.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.953
They're much weaker than that.

43:43.037 --> 43:45.247
And if we run out of time?

43:46.290 --> 43:50.085
That's something to look forward to
when the time comes.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.758
So, who's this guy?

43:58.927 --> 44:00.804
How rude of me.

44:01.555 --> 44:04.308
I will be overseeing this game.

44:04.391 --> 44:10.773
I'm Kakero Club's Number Two Referee,
Hikoichi Yako.

44:11.398 --> 44:13.192
Kakero Club?

44:16.862 --> 44:21.367
-Incidentally, Kakero Club is--
-No need to explain.

44:22.951 --> 44:26.413
More importantly, mister,
we're not playing.

44:27.122 --> 44:30.167
Kaji, let's go home.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.669
What's wrong? You scared?

44:32.711 --> 44:34.588
No. It's the prize.

44:36.006 --> 44:39.009
-Then, how much do you want?
-I don't want money.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.013
What I want is
your Kakero Club membership.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.851
Is that why you came here?

44:48.435 --> 44:51.438
-If you're scared, I'll ask someone else.
-What?

44:51.522 --> 44:54.066
I'm saying, back out now
before it's too late.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.653
Before I gobble you up.

44:59.738 --> 45:03.575
Fine. I'll add my membership
to the ten million. Good?

45:05.494 --> 45:08.247
I have no objections.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.875
Thank you!

45:16.630 --> 45:19.466
Here. To show you how I feel.

45:22.845 --> 45:26.598
Alright. Who wants to wear this?

45:28.350 --> 45:30.436
This guy, of course.

45:31.311 --> 45:33.647
Baku!

45:33.730 --> 45:37.401
You have two hours.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.780
Now, let the game begin!

45:59.131 --> 46:01.133
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

46:07.973 --> 46:10.225
Huh? Who's that?

46:19.485 --> 46:20.611
No way.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.779
-Was that real?
-Kaji, run!

46:28.994 --> 46:31.205
This is too much!

46:34.583 --> 46:35.834
Let's go, Kaji!

46:38.670 --> 46:40.589
Kaji, this way!

46:56.772 --> 47:00.567
-That guy was trying to kill us!
-That must be the old guy's pet.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.278
Huh? But he said they were weak pets.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.822
Well, humans aren't as strong
as lions and tigers.

47:05.906 --> 47:09.243
But he has a weapon!
That's gotta be against the rules!

47:09.326 --> 47:11.328
That old guy's a lust murderer.

47:11.411 --> 47:13.830
He likes chasing down
and playing with his victims.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.625
No way. You've got to be kidding.

47:17.417 --> 47:18.544
The police!

47:24.216 --> 47:26.134
No good. I have no connection.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.887
Don't bother. I'm sure
he's got signal blockers.

47:28.971 --> 47:32.057
Why are you acting like this is normal?
We might be killed!

47:32.140 --> 47:34.685
That's the kind of game Kakero oversees.

47:36.144 --> 47:39.064
So, this time limit?

47:39.147 --> 47:42.484
Yeah. It's probably a time bomb.
If we don't get the keys, bam!

47:46.613 --> 47:49.116
Don't look so down!

47:49.199 --> 47:52.327
I'm gonna gobble up that old man.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.639
Crap. Hey!

48:12.723 --> 48:15.350
If I win this game,
I'll get ten million yen.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.811
Won't you give me your key?

48:18.437 --> 48:21.023
There are five of you,
so you'll each get two million.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.275
-Two million?
-Yeah.

48:23.358 --> 48:24.651
I'll think about it!

48:24.735 --> 48:26.194
Really?

48:28.071 --> 48:29.531
Hey, you lied!

48:55.974 --> 48:57.100
Okay.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.480
Kaji, give me your leg!

49:04.232 --> 49:07.152
One hour, 19 minutes.

49:10.489 --> 49:14.242
<i>Okay, that's one down.</i>
<i>Shall we find the next, Kaji?</i>

49:14.326 --> 49:16.244
<i>Okay!</i>

49:17.204 --> 49:18.580
Not bad.

49:21.833 --> 49:26.004
The prey has moved from A11 to B11.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.464
Don't let them get away!

49:35.597 --> 49:37.557
Let's stop here to come up with a plan.

49:37.641 --> 49:40.727
We really need to get
this timer off my leg.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.271
No, don't! If you mess with it,
it might explode.

49:59.579 --> 50:01.957
<i>Let's stop here to come up with a plan.</i>

50:04.751 --> 50:08.839
-<i>No, don't!</i>
-Let's get the key, shall we?

50:21.435 --> 50:23.061
Only 52 minutes left.

50:23.895 --> 50:26.189
Let's go, Kaji.

50:32.988 --> 50:34.114
Kaji.

50:36.575 --> 50:37.784
Look.

50:44.207 --> 50:46.126
They'll get you if you're not careful.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.342
Okay.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.352
Alright.

51:09.733 --> 51:10.984
Gotta be this way.

51:18.074 --> 51:19.242
There's one!

51:31.296 --> 51:32.839
Baku, run!

51:49.314 --> 51:52.901
Nice timing, Kaji. What an actor!

51:52.984 --> 51:55.362
I really thought I was gonna die.

51:59.199 --> 52:00.450
Okay.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.790
Baku, run!

52:11.253 --> 52:12.170
All right.

52:12.671 --> 52:14.589
Let's go get the last one.

52:15.924 --> 52:17.926
Yeah.

52:19.052 --> 52:22.138
-That must hurt.
-Sixteen minutes left!

52:25.642 --> 52:27.561
<i>They're tied up and heading your way.</i>

52:29.229 --> 52:30.480
Leave it to me.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.721
Hurry up and give me the key.

53:10.437 --> 53:11.688
Seventeen seconds.

53:15.191 --> 53:16.818
We did it.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.445
Thank God!

53:20.238 --> 53:24.034
<i>Report! Have you caught the prey?</i>
<i>You haven't killed them yet, right?</i>

53:27.412 --> 53:28.997
We're fine.

53:29.080 --> 53:32.208
But your soldiers have been annihilated.

53:35.378 --> 53:38.965
<i>You listening, mister?</i>
<i>You'll have to try a little harder.</i>

53:41.551 --> 53:43.136
That fucking brat!

53:49.559 --> 53:51.269
Rodem!

53:54.064 --> 53:57.233
Wake up!

54:07.619 --> 54:08.662
Okay.

54:12.624 --> 54:16.586
Rodem, you're up!

54:48.284 --> 54:49.452
What was that?

54:50.203 --> 54:52.539
It's him. He's coming!

54:52.622 --> 54:54.332
Who? Who is coming?

55:20.900 --> 55:22.485
Kaji, let's go!

55:23.111 --> 55:25.655
Baku! Wait for me!

55:33.204 --> 55:36.166
Is that your rumored human weapon?

55:36.249 --> 55:39.377
Yes. My beloved son.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.964
I developed him back
when I was a mercenary

55:43.048 --> 55:46.301
as part of a human experiment program.

55:46.384 --> 55:48.678
He's my ultimate masterpiece!

55:56.519 --> 56:00.398
Rodem's weakness
is that his brain is too small.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.443
He falls asleep within 15 minutes.

56:04.319 --> 56:07.447
But that's more than enough time.

56:07.530 --> 56:10.700
Nothing ever survives him.

56:22.670 --> 56:26.174
This is bad. We're really going to die!

56:28.635 --> 56:31.763
Baku! Let's get out of here!

56:31.846 --> 56:33.973
If we grovel, he might forgive us!

56:34.057 --> 56:36.184
So you just wanna run away again, Kaji?

56:36.893 --> 56:42.023
Don't you want to see that old man repent?

56:42.857 --> 56:44.901
To confess his sins?

56:47.779 --> 56:51.366
It's okay. Just trust me.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.664
LOW CONCENTRATION ETHANOL

57:24.482 --> 57:27.152
What is this? A bullfight?

57:37.579 --> 57:39.289
I'm over here!

58:07.484 --> 58:08.359
Put me down!

58:09.194 --> 58:10.445
Put me down!

58:11.654 --> 58:13.031
Dammit!

58:20.705 --> 58:21.706
Kaji, do it now!

58:29.255 --> 58:30.882
Baku!

58:30.965 --> 58:32.383
<i>Adios.</i>

58:36.763 --> 58:38.932
<i>Nice job, Kaji.</i>

58:41.935 --> 58:45.813
<i>Too bad. Your greatest masterpiece</i>
<i>is done for.</i>

58:46.481 --> 58:47.482
<i>Let's go.</i>

58:49.609 --> 58:51.361
Rodem!

58:51.444 --> 58:54.906
My Rodem. How? How could you lose?

58:54.989 --> 58:58.159
You've failed me!

59:01.496 --> 59:04.332
My greatest masterpiece?

59:05.333 --> 59:07.293
Why would he know that?

59:13.091 --> 59:14.175
It's a listening device.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.595
You knew about this?

59:17.679 --> 59:19.222
It's not against the rules.

59:20.723 --> 59:22.725
I believe that was decided.

59:27.855 --> 59:30.942
Nobody has ever survived this game?

59:32.277 --> 59:33.528
You're…

59:34.487 --> 59:36.155
a liar, aren't you?

59:45.415 --> 59:47.041
The game is over.

59:48.668 --> 59:52.213
Mr. Kokonoe, I declare you the loser.

59:56.301 --> 59:58.011
Thank you.

1:00:03.891 --> 1:00:06.894
That was the most fun I've had in a while.

1:00:08.438 --> 1:00:10.064
By the way.

1:00:10.148 --> 1:00:13.443
Did you really take down Rodem?

1:00:14.152 --> 1:00:15.486
Of course not.

1:00:17.697 --> 1:00:20.450
Rodem can only be active for 15 minutes.

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:22.952
If we could hold out long enough,
he'd fall asleep.

1:00:23.036 --> 1:00:24.454
Baku!

1:00:31.085 --> 1:00:35.214
<i>So we used the ethanol to take out</i>
<i>his eyesight and restrict his movements.</i>

1:00:37.592 --> 1:00:41.679
<i>I'm a pacifist.</i>
<i>I don't want to kill anyone.</i>

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:45.683
Well, then.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:50.938
Allow me to formally
welcome Kaji into the Kakero Club.

1:00:52.231 --> 1:00:53.983
-I'm a member now?
-Yes.

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:57.487
Due to certain circumstances,
Mr. Madarame cannot be a member.

1:00:57.570 --> 1:01:02.367
However, I have no problem
with you becoming a member, Mr. Kaji.

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:08.998
Baku. Was this your plan all along?

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.752
Mr. Kaji, please allow me

1:01:14.629 --> 1:01:17.006
to be your designated referee.

1:01:20.176 --> 1:01:24.180
HIKOICHI YAKO

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:28.643
No, thank you.

1:01:29.143 --> 1:01:31.479
I can't do this! I can't take it!

1:01:33.439 --> 1:01:37.276
Baku, our worlds are too different.

1:01:39.445 --> 1:01:40.822
You're right.

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:44.450
It was pure luck we survived today.

1:01:44.534 --> 1:01:47.286
What lies ahead is an even worse hell.

1:01:50.581 --> 1:01:52.208
I'm sorry.

1:02:05.847 --> 1:02:07.014
What a shame.

1:02:07.890 --> 1:02:09.559
I'll take the membership.

1:02:19.986 --> 1:02:21.028
Mr. Madarame.

1:02:21.821 --> 1:02:23.740
Where did you get this?

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:32.790
When Rodem slammed me down.

1:02:37.545 --> 1:02:39.046
Kaji, do it now!

1:03:14.874 --> 1:03:16.626
You finally awake?

1:03:19.253 --> 1:03:23.424
Yako called me
after finding me in your phone history.

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:29.263
Well, I am sort of responsible for giving
you the idea to bet against Kokonoe.

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:34.644
I'll take care of you
until your wound heals.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:40.107
Hey! What are you doing?

1:03:41.901 --> 1:03:42.985
Ranko.

1:03:44.403 --> 1:03:45.404
Thank you.

1:03:47.114 --> 1:03:50.701
You don't really have to thank me.

1:03:53.037 --> 1:03:57.166
I have… one more favor to ask.

1:03:59.001 --> 1:04:00.294
A favor?

1:04:02.964 --> 1:04:04.298
Yeah. A favor.

1:04:05.591 --> 1:04:06.551
Well…

1:04:07.343 --> 1:04:09.345
If you're going to beg,

1:04:10.805 --> 1:04:13.558
I guess I can hear what you have to say.

1:04:16.811 --> 1:04:17.687
Really?

1:04:20.189 --> 1:04:21.148
Yeah.

1:04:32.326 --> 1:04:35.538
Can I bring someone here?

1:04:37.415 --> 1:04:38.583
What?

1:04:40.042 --> 1:04:42.253
He's a wild beast,
but he has nowhere to go.

1:04:43.546 --> 1:04:44.547
Please!

1:05:05.151 --> 1:05:06.736
Who am I?

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:10.197
Who am I?

1:05:10.781 --> 1:05:12.658
When you were little,

1:05:13.659 --> 1:05:17.455
you were kidnapped by a mean old man
and subjected to evil experiments.

1:05:19.707 --> 1:05:23.169
There's a bad person
inside you named Rodem.

1:05:24.295 --> 1:05:25.838
And he's killed a lot of people.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:31.052
What should I do?

1:05:32.595 --> 1:05:34.597
Please tell me, mister.

1:05:35.222 --> 1:05:37.224
You're not a murderer.

1:05:38.351 --> 1:05:40.102
But you're not innocent.

1:05:41.604 --> 1:05:45.566
You'll have to take responsibility
for your sins, atone for them,

1:05:46.317 --> 1:05:48.277
and live on.

1:05:48.361 --> 1:05:49.654
Atone?

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.157
How do I do that?

1:05:54.408 --> 1:05:56.077
Just come with me.

1:06:00.957 --> 1:06:03.501
I'll help you conquer your sins.

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:10.424
However, I will never tell you
to kill someone.

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:31.862
Mr. Kaji.

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:34.865
I'm sorry.

1:06:35.449 --> 1:06:37.827
You had something to ask me?

1:06:41.372 --> 1:06:43.040
It's about Baku.

1:06:45.334 --> 1:06:49.714
What kind of world does he live in?

1:06:50.965 --> 1:06:53.634
THE RESIDENCE OF RANKO KURAMA

1:06:53.718 --> 1:06:55.344
Marco, come on.

1:07:05.604 --> 1:07:07.773
I talked to Mr. Yako.

1:07:10.109 --> 1:07:12.570
You almost died
and you're still taking on Kakero?

1:07:13.070 --> 1:07:14.822
I don't get you.

1:07:17.199 --> 1:07:19.035
And that escape game.

1:07:19.118 --> 1:07:22.955
You used me to get a Kakero membership.
That really pisses me off!

1:07:27.585 --> 1:07:28.836
It pisses me off, but…

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:33.049
I still want to do it with you.

1:07:35.342 --> 1:07:36.385
Kaji.

1:07:36.969 --> 1:07:41.015
Baku, you always tell me to trust you.

1:07:42.224 --> 1:07:43.976
Those words held no lies.

1:07:47.063 --> 1:07:48.522
Baku.

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:50.524
Please…

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:53.277
let me be by your side!

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:57.782
You sure? You might die next time.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:07.166
By the way…

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:09.835
Who's that behind you?

1:08:14.131 --> 1:08:15.174
It's Rodem.

1:08:22.473 --> 1:08:23.474
Rodem?

1:08:25.142 --> 1:08:28.104
What?

1:08:28.187 --> 1:08:30.147
Oh. Oh yeah.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:34.110
From today on, we're calling him Marco.
Play nice, okay?

1:08:34.193 --> 1:08:36.987
I'm Marco! Nice to meet you!

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:39.073
Hello.

1:08:46.122 --> 1:08:47.081
That hurts.

1:08:47.164 --> 1:08:50.084
KURAMA-GUMI

1:08:51.001 --> 1:08:54.088
Excuse me? You want to bring
another freeloader into my house?

1:08:55.214 --> 1:08:58.217
Some stuff happened. Please!

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.553
Don't get carried away!

1:09:00.636 --> 1:09:03.222
I'm the head of the Kurama clan, you know.

1:09:12.189 --> 1:09:14.650
He's really good at using a knife.

1:09:15.818 --> 1:09:19.864
That's because he's used to using them.
And that's a hatchet.

1:09:26.287 --> 1:09:27.288
That's delicious!

1:09:30.082 --> 1:09:31.417
It's really good, Marco!

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:33.794
Marco, you're the Minister of Cooking now!

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:36.839
-Okay!
-You can't just decide that!

1:09:36.922 --> 1:09:39.383
-Why not?
-I'll cook bear tomorrow!

1:09:39.466 --> 1:09:42.344
-That sounds great!
-We don't eat bear!

1:09:47.391 --> 1:09:51.937
I've decided who will go against Sadakuni.

1:09:52.521 --> 1:09:54.857
Who will be next?

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:58.986
The new member, Takaomi Kaji.

1:09:59.069 --> 1:10:02.114
A new member? Will such a person
be suitable for the job?

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:07.870
Takaomi Kaji
has Baku Madarame by his side.

1:10:07.953 --> 1:10:09.205
The Lie Eater?

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:14.919
How interesting.

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:18.923
But he was expelled.

1:10:19.006 --> 1:10:21.050
<i>What will the Royal Leader say?</i>

1:10:22.885 --> 1:10:25.346
"I don't remember him."

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:27.348
"Do as you please."

1:10:28.307 --> 1:10:30.100
Or something of the like.

1:10:31.602 --> 1:10:33.646
On that day,

1:10:34.355 --> 1:10:39.026
it will be held at the main headquarters,

1:10:39.109 --> 1:10:43.072
so the Royal Leader will come to observe.

1:10:44.490 --> 1:10:50.079
Make sure no one messes this up.

1:10:59.004 --> 1:11:00.631
Referee Mekama.

1:11:02.216 --> 1:11:05.302
I heard you became
Sadakuni's designated referee.

1:11:05.886 --> 1:11:08.013
Yes, I have been honored with the role.

1:11:09.223 --> 1:11:12.434
If I'm lucky, I might be able
to watch history change

1:11:12.518 --> 1:11:15.396
right before my eyes.

1:11:18.190 --> 1:11:20.234
You seem quite excited.

1:11:21.735 --> 1:11:26.573
Don't you think it's also time
for a change in the referee rankings?

1:12:02.651 --> 1:12:08.032
METHANE HYDRATE LABORATORY

1:12:11.201 --> 1:12:12.411
<i>Yes!</i>

1:12:13.537 --> 1:12:16.582
Sir, the results
from the research ship are in.

1:12:16.665 --> 1:12:20.294
The surface layer contains
a massive amount of methane hydrant!

1:12:20.377 --> 1:12:23.297
We did it! Now we can try
a new method of mining it.

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:27.134
Yes. This will change the world.

1:12:27.217 --> 1:12:30.846
We don't intend to collaborate
with the Japanese government.

1:12:31.430 --> 1:12:35.142
Are you telling me you plan to sell
this technology to another country?

1:12:35.893 --> 1:12:38.312
No, rather, I plan

1:12:38.395 --> 1:12:41.315
to share this technology
with other countries for free.

1:12:41.940 --> 1:12:44.276
Where's the profit in that?

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:46.445
Profit?

1:12:47.321 --> 1:12:51.033
What I want is a world without war.

1:12:51.575 --> 1:12:53.077
I want world peace.

1:12:58.248 --> 1:13:01.668
I never knew a scientist
could be such a romantic.

1:13:04.129 --> 1:13:08.926
Professor? Dr. Matsuyama
sent us some fruit in congratulations.

1:13:10.302 --> 1:13:11.887
Put it in the fridge.

1:13:11.970 --> 1:13:13.889
-We'll eat it together later.
-Okay.

1:13:14.932 --> 1:13:17.101
What's inside?

1:13:20.479 --> 1:13:22.564
Looks so good!

1:13:36.412 --> 1:13:37.788
Professor?

1:13:43.293 --> 1:13:47.297
Is everyone… alright?

1:13:48.507 --> 1:13:50.217
Besides you…

1:13:53.053 --> 1:13:56.473
they all… died.

1:13:59.810 --> 1:14:01.520
After that…

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:05.190
Minister Onodera sent us a message.

1:14:05.983 --> 1:14:07.818
He said, if you change your mind…

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:11.738
he's happy to help any time.

1:14:28.255 --> 1:14:30.132
That bastard.

1:14:33.594 --> 1:14:36.263
<i>He did this!</i>

1:14:42.811 --> 1:14:44.646
Professor Sadakuni?

1:14:45.772 --> 1:14:48.817
My name is Kusanami. I'm a consultant.

1:14:51.695 --> 1:14:54.865
Have you ever heard of
an organization called Kakero Club?

1:14:54.948 --> 1:14:56.575
Kakero?

1:14:56.658 --> 1:15:00.078
It's a dark organization
with a lot of power.

1:15:01.455 --> 1:15:06.335
If you stood at the head of it,
you could achieve your dreams.

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:09.838
Would you…

1:15:10.839 --> 1:15:12.799
turn yourself into a beast?

1:15:13.967 --> 1:15:17.471
Could you throw away your soul?

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:24.186
What do you see in my eyes?

1:15:26.563 --> 1:15:27.648
I'll tell you.

1:15:28.982 --> 1:15:35.155
Fury and hatred and a new,
unshakeable conviction!

1:16:15.862 --> 1:16:19.283
Mr. Yako. Is the Royal Leader coming?

1:16:19.366 --> 1:16:21.118
He's on his way.

1:16:21.785 --> 1:16:24.079
Then we can't lose.

1:16:48.687 --> 1:16:49.938
Right this way.

1:17:16.923 --> 1:17:18.800
This is impressive.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:30.854
How much did you bring?

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:35.233
-Fifty million.
-Unbelievable. We told you two billion!

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:38.987
She's really mad!

1:17:46.578 --> 1:17:48.705
Let's not have a gun fight.

1:17:48.789 --> 1:17:51.583
We'd rather not have to deal with that.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:52.709
Sorry.

1:17:59.216 --> 1:18:04.346
-Mr. Madarame will recruit owners.
-Owners?

1:18:04.429 --> 1:18:08.475
As if he were a prize horse.
They will invest in Mr. Madarame's game

1:18:09.059 --> 1:18:13.522
and if he wins, they will earn a reward
of three times their investment.

1:18:14.815 --> 1:18:19.945
However, for the reassurance
of our members, the loser today

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:24.116
will experience hellish pain,
torture, and execution.

1:18:25.492 --> 1:18:27.160
There are some who invest,

1:18:27.244 --> 1:18:31.456
not for the money but to witness
the violent death of a person.

1:18:32.249 --> 1:18:35.377
Oh? Interesting.

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:37.587
Let's see you try.

1:18:41.717 --> 1:18:46.388
Well, then, investors.
We will accept million-yen increments.

1:18:46.471 --> 1:18:50.434
Today's subject will be Baku Madarame.

1:18:50.517 --> 1:18:52.477
Now, please begin.

1:18:52.561 --> 1:18:54.855
<i>-Five million!</i>
<i>-Three million!</i>

1:18:55.856 --> 1:18:57.816
<i>-Eight million!</i>
<i>-Five million!</i>

1:18:57.899 --> 1:18:59.025
<i>-Ten million!</i>
<i>-Three million!</i>

1:18:59.109 --> 1:19:00.861
<i>-Five million!</i>
<i>-Three million!</i>

1:19:00.944 --> 1:19:02.279
<i>-Three million!</i>
<i>-Six million!</i>

1:19:02.362 --> 1:19:03.405
<i>Three million!</i>

1:19:03.488 --> 1:19:05.365
<i>Ah, so annoying!</i>

1:19:05.449 --> 1:19:06.283
<i>Five million.</i>

1:19:06.366 --> 1:19:08.827
<i>-One million!</i>
<i>-Two million!</i>

1:19:08.910 --> 1:19:10.912
<i>-Six million!</i>
<i>-Dealt a bad hand, huh?</i>

1:19:10.996 --> 1:19:12.622
<i>-Five million!</i>
<i>-Four million!</i>

1:19:12.706 --> 1:19:14.833
<i>-Six million!</i>
<i>-Four million!</i>

1:19:15.625 --> 1:19:18.295
<i>Come on. Invest more!</i>

1:19:18.378 --> 1:19:20.964
Only 200 million? No way you'll make it.

1:19:21.047 --> 1:19:25.051
Come on, everyone. We can't have that!

1:19:25.135 --> 1:19:27.804
<i>Five hundred million!</i>
<i>I'll put in 500 million!</i>

1:19:29.639 --> 1:19:32.142
<i>Have you all forgotten?</i>

1:19:32.225 --> 1:19:33.143
<i>It's Baku Madarame.</i>

1:19:33.226 --> 1:19:34.936
The Lie Eater.

1:19:35.020 --> 1:19:37.314
He's back!

1:19:39.357 --> 1:19:40.859
<i>The Lie Eater?</i>

1:19:40.942 --> 1:19:43.403
<i>-Fifty million!</i>
<i>-Seventy million for me!</i>

1:19:43.487 --> 1:19:45.572
<i>For the Lie Eater, 100 million!</i>

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:51.161
Don't get the wrong idea.

1:19:51.244 --> 1:19:54.873
I just want the money
Sadakuni stole from me back.

1:19:54.956 --> 1:19:57.417
<i>Sixty million!</i>

1:19:58.835 --> 1:20:01.296
Mistress, 500 million.

1:20:01.379 --> 1:20:04.132
-That's everything we have!
-We have no choice!

1:20:04.633 --> 1:20:07.969
Someone had to set the mood
or the Lie Eater won't get to compete.

1:20:08.053 --> 1:20:10.806
<i>-Fifty million!</i>
<i>-Fifty million!</i>

1:20:10.889 --> 1:20:11.932
<i>Sixty million!</i>

1:20:15.727 --> 1:20:17.103
Two billion.

1:20:17.187 --> 1:20:18.522
Well, then.

1:20:19.773 --> 1:20:21.650
Now, I'm fired up.

1:20:22.317 --> 1:20:23.276
<i>Hangman!</i>

1:20:25.946 --> 1:20:27.656
<i>Great idea! Hangman!</i>

1:20:28.365 --> 1:20:31.284
<i>Hangman! Hangman!</i>

1:20:31.868 --> 1:20:34.454
Mekama, what's Hangman?

1:20:36.081 --> 1:20:42.379
It's a public execution where
the loser and his partner

1:20:42.462 --> 1:20:44.548
are both hanged together.

1:20:45.131 --> 1:20:47.801
Wait.

1:20:47.884 --> 1:20:51.304
By partner, they mean,
if you lose, I die too?

1:20:51.388 --> 1:20:52.472
Yup.

1:20:53.181 --> 1:20:56.560
They want to watch. That's why
they're investing so much money.

1:20:56.643 --> 1:20:58.144
Seriously?

1:21:02.190 --> 1:21:03.525
Baku.

1:21:03.608 --> 1:21:05.360
Are you scared, Kaji?

1:21:07.988 --> 1:21:08.989
No.

1:21:10.448 --> 1:21:11.867
I trust you.

1:21:12.492 --> 1:21:13.869
Baku.

1:21:19.624 --> 1:21:20.584
Very well.

1:21:23.336 --> 1:21:25.839
We also accept.

1:21:29.676 --> 1:21:32.137
But Mr. Sadakuni…

1:21:40.770 --> 1:21:44.983
Mekama is getting Sadakuni too excited.

1:21:45.775 --> 1:21:49.654
Humans follow the will of God.
Every life has its purpose.

1:21:50.697 --> 1:21:52.949
We die when we die.

1:21:54.618 --> 1:21:56.745
I won't rely on heaven.

1:21:57.537 --> 1:21:59.664
I will win this match.

1:22:00.332 --> 1:22:02.667
Cocky as always.

1:22:03.335 --> 1:22:05.629
He hasn't grown at all.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:10.258
Very well. Hangman is approved.

1:22:10.842 --> 1:22:13.303
Let us choose the game.

1:22:21.186 --> 1:22:24.314
Sadakuni can read his opponent's cards.

1:22:25.065 --> 1:22:29.277
If he chooses Old Maid,
the Lie Eater is out.

1:22:37.077 --> 1:22:38.495
The shuffling is complete.

1:22:39.496 --> 1:22:42.958
Mr. Sadakuni, please pick one.

1:22:54.469 --> 1:22:58.765
The game is Hangman Old Maid.

1:22:58.848 --> 1:23:00.850
<i>Old Maid!</i>

1:23:02.352 --> 1:23:03.395
<i>Let's get started!</i>

1:23:04.479 --> 1:23:07.649
Old Maid? That's bad!

1:23:07.732 --> 1:23:10.110
We'll be safe as long as
we don't have the old maid.

1:23:11.027 --> 1:23:15.824
Now, I will explain
the rules of Hangman Old Maid.

1:23:17.325 --> 1:23:19.786
The game chosen by Mr. Sadakuni

1:23:19.869 --> 1:23:22.789
is a well-known game called Old Maid.

1:23:25.667 --> 1:23:30.255
<i>The cards in play will be two sets</i>
<i>of number cards, one through ten,</i>

1:23:30.338 --> 1:23:34.634
<i>and one old maid, for a total of 21 cards.</i>

1:23:35.218 --> 1:23:39.222
<i>Each player must take one card from</i>
<i>the opponent at a time and make pairs.</i>

1:23:39.305 --> 1:23:43.184
<i>The player holding the old maid</i>
<i>at the end of the game loses.</i>

1:23:43.268 --> 1:23:47.105
<i>However, this old maid</i>
<i>is different from ordinary old maids.</i>

1:23:47.188 --> 1:23:51.901
<i>There are five kinds of old maids,</i>
<i>each with a number from one to five.</i>

1:23:52.819 --> 1:23:55.280
<i>With each game, these will be shuffled</i>

1:23:55.363 --> 1:23:58.783
<i>and one will be included in the deck.</i>

1:24:00.326 --> 1:24:02.871
<i>Each number denotes</i>

1:24:02.954 --> 1:24:05.749
<i>the number of parts</i>
<i>of the gallows to be assembled.</i>

1:24:05.832 --> 1:24:09.919
<i>When the gallows are complete,</i>
<i>the game ends.</i>

1:24:11.004 --> 1:24:14.090
<i>The gallows are composed of 11 parts.</i>

1:24:14.799 --> 1:24:19.012
<i>At the shortest, it could end</i>
<i>in just three games.</i>

1:24:23.433 --> 1:24:26.561
Sharing of information
during the game is not allowed.

1:24:26.644 --> 1:24:29.981
However, as long as it's not
discovered by your opponent,

1:24:30.065 --> 1:24:35.695
underhanded tactics
are of no concern to Kakero.

1:24:36.946 --> 1:24:39.866
Now, then, let us begin the first round.

1:24:39.949 --> 1:24:43.787
ROUND ONE

1:24:46.873 --> 1:24:47.832
Go ahead.

1:24:49.167 --> 1:24:50.502
<i>Five and eight.</i>

1:24:51.086 --> 1:24:52.712
Mr. Madarame is up first.

1:24:52.796 --> 1:24:54.380
<i>The Lie Eater's first!</i>

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:58.551
In order to prevent the players
from sharing information,

1:24:58.635 --> 1:25:02.597
we will be turning off
the videos of the Owners.

1:25:29.290 --> 1:25:30.834
<i>Old Maid Five!</i>

1:25:37.090 --> 1:25:39.050
Alright.

1:25:45.849 --> 1:25:50.145
Sada, the card you want is this one.

1:25:51.062 --> 1:25:52.480
<i>This is a special freebie.</i>

1:25:53.731 --> 1:25:59.404
Now, trust me and draw it.

1:26:00.071 --> 1:26:01.281
Go on!

1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:10.498
Finished.

1:26:10.999 --> 1:26:12.458
You're…

1:26:13.877 --> 1:26:15.628
a liar, aren't you?

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:24.846
Idiot! Don't act like this is fine!

1:26:25.638 --> 1:26:27.724
Five right off the bat.

1:26:44.115 --> 1:26:45.408
<i>A hangman's gallows.</i>

1:27:05.011 --> 1:27:08.097
The main pole and four supporting legs.

1:27:08.806 --> 1:27:10.892
Five parts are complete.

1:27:11.392 --> 1:27:13.394
Only six remain.

1:27:16.147 --> 1:27:17.982
Man.

1:27:18.066 --> 1:27:20.777
I didn't think it would happen so easily.

1:27:24.113 --> 1:27:29.827
ROUND TWO

1:27:29.911 --> 1:27:33.456
BAKU MADARAME
5/11 SIX REMAINING

1:27:40.046 --> 1:27:41.297
Yes!

1:27:41.881 --> 1:27:43.007
<i>This time…</i>

1:27:43.925 --> 1:27:45.802
Mr. Sadakuni starts.

1:28:02.986 --> 1:28:03.987
Here you go.

1:28:14.872 --> 1:28:18.751
Now, it's your turn.

1:28:19.585 --> 1:28:22.171
Well…

1:28:23.798 --> 1:28:25.800
Which one is it?

1:28:27.385 --> 1:28:29.053
Right?

1:28:30.179 --> 1:28:31.306
Or left?

1:28:41.607 --> 1:28:45.320
I figured it out! Sada, you didn't notice?

1:28:45.903 --> 1:28:48.489
You can tell if you look
from different angles.

1:28:49.115 --> 1:28:51.701
It's reflecting on your glasses.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:54.162
A five.

1:28:55.663 --> 1:28:58.291
Then draw that one!

1:28:58.791 --> 1:29:01.836
Your reaction hides no lies.

1:29:01.919 --> 1:29:04.172
This has got to be the five!

1:29:05.882 --> 1:29:06.841
Huh?

1:29:06.924 --> 1:29:08.593
<i>Old Maid Four!</i>

1:29:08.676 --> 1:29:11.304
Put up your cards.

1:29:12.180 --> 1:29:15.350
I'll draw and finish this game!

1:29:30.406 --> 1:29:33.242
I win.

1:29:34.994 --> 1:29:37.413
That man never doubts himself.

1:29:37.997 --> 1:29:39.540
What is going on?

1:29:59.519 --> 1:30:00.895
Baku.

1:30:01.854 --> 1:30:04.190
Don't worry, Kaji.

1:30:05.191 --> 1:30:07.151
It's only just beginning.

1:30:07.693 --> 1:30:09.821
Two parts left.

1:30:09.904 --> 1:30:13.866
Depending on the number of the old maid,
this could be the last game.

1:30:15.618 --> 1:30:18.246
If you're trying to scare me,
it won't work.

1:30:19.622 --> 1:30:23.501
Come on. Let's hurry up
and start the third round.

1:30:31.509 --> 1:30:32.927
Mr. Sadakuni starts.

1:30:33.010 --> 1:30:34.971
ROUND THREE

1:30:35.054 --> 1:30:40.601
BAKU MADARAME
9/11 TWO REMAINING

1:30:51.154 --> 1:30:52.864
Alright.

1:31:04.625 --> 1:31:07.920
Okay. Bring it on.

1:31:15.303 --> 1:31:16.888
This one?

1:31:18.264 --> 1:31:20.558
<i>No. This one?</i>

1:31:23.394 --> 1:31:25.188
Hey, what's wrong?

1:31:25.771 --> 1:31:26.898
Hurry up and draw.

1:31:30.276 --> 1:31:31.485
Maybe this one.

1:31:39.243 --> 1:31:40.703
Hurry up and draw!

1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:49.503
Damn!

1:31:50.755 --> 1:31:52.298
Kaji, what do I do?

1:31:56.594 --> 1:31:58.763
Are you ready…

1:32:00.014 --> 1:32:01.974
Lie Eater?

1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:31.462
The next one finishes it.

1:32:39.470 --> 1:32:42.890
I didn't expect it to be this bad.

1:32:42.974 --> 1:32:45.476
That the Lie Eater would be beaten.

1:32:57.321 --> 1:32:59.323
The gallows are complete.

1:33:00.032 --> 1:33:01.951
<i>All that's left is to be hanged.</i>

1:33:09.917 --> 1:33:11.127
Baku.

1:33:13.462 --> 1:33:15.131
Sorry, Kaji.

1:33:18.134 --> 1:33:20.094
I can't eat the lie.

1:33:27.435 --> 1:33:31.272
So even the famous Lie Eater
has run out of luck.

1:33:32.231 --> 1:33:34.567
Stop spouting nonsense.

1:33:35.151 --> 1:33:37.111
<i>There's no such thing as luck.</i>

1:33:38.279 --> 1:33:43.159
That man only focuses
on tactics and cheating.

1:33:43.868 --> 1:33:47.163
He's just a piece of shit
that isn't even prepared to die.

1:33:49.332 --> 1:33:52.418
<i>In the end, he doesn't have what it takes.</i>

1:33:54.128 --> 1:33:57.923
Having the guts to throw
your life away is what brings victory!

1:33:58.591 --> 1:34:00.885
<i>Accomplishes great things.</i>

1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:06.682
Lie Eater, do something!

1:34:06.766 --> 1:34:09.185
I bet 500 million on you
because I believe in you!

1:34:12.730 --> 1:34:15.900
ROUND FOUR

1:34:15.983 --> 1:34:22.698
BAKU MADARAME
10/11 ONE REMAINING

1:34:31.957 --> 1:34:33.167
<i>The old maid.</i>

1:34:39.215 --> 1:34:41.050
Get it together, Lie Eater!

1:34:43.677 --> 1:34:47.014
Me and Ranko are betting our lives on you.

1:34:47.098 --> 1:34:49.308
What? Are you just gonna give up?

1:34:53.145 --> 1:34:54.313
I'll…

1:34:55.523 --> 1:34:57.483
believe in you until the very end!

1:35:02.530 --> 1:35:03.697
Kaji.

1:35:04.698 --> 1:35:06.617
I'm glad you're my buddy.

1:35:13.791 --> 1:35:16.168
Mr. Madarame starts.

1:35:45.239 --> 1:35:46.782
Now…

1:35:48.159 --> 1:35:49.660
die.

1:36:26.697 --> 1:36:28.699
Hey, won't you go up against me?

1:36:30.826 --> 1:36:33.579
You can't tell if it's heads or tails?

1:36:33.662 --> 1:36:35.664
I have no reason to take you on.

1:36:46.133 --> 1:36:50.054
What the hell are you doing?
Hold up your cards!

1:36:51.889 --> 1:36:53.682
Okay.

1:37:09.073 --> 1:37:11.492
Top or bottom. Which is it?

1:37:16.747 --> 1:37:18.415
What's wrong?

1:37:18.499 --> 1:37:20.543
It's either top or bottom.

1:37:24.672 --> 1:37:25.881
Bottom.

1:37:34.431 --> 1:37:36.475
Sadakuni drew the maid.

1:37:37.059 --> 1:37:41.438
Nice! That's the first time
you drew the old maid, Sada.

1:37:45.025 --> 1:37:46.944
Don't get excited.

1:37:53.409 --> 1:37:54.410
This one.

1:38:01.542 --> 1:38:03.377
I win.

1:38:11.135 --> 1:38:12.845
Somehow, we're still alive.

1:38:16.599 --> 1:38:20.728
IKKI SADAKUNI
3/11 EIGHT REMAINING

1:38:20.811 --> 1:38:23.397
BAKU MADARAME
10/11 ONE REMAINING

1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:27.484
ROUND FIVE

1:38:28.193 --> 1:38:29.028
Here you are.

1:38:31.905 --> 1:38:34.325
Mr. Sadakuni starts.

1:38:39.371 --> 1:38:42.249
What's wrong? I'm over here.

1:39:05.689 --> 1:39:06.565
Baku?

1:39:09.193 --> 1:39:11.612
What is he doing?

1:39:20.329 --> 1:39:21.747
Oi!

1:39:23.666 --> 1:39:26.168
How long are you going to stand there?

1:39:27.044 --> 1:39:29.338
Hurry up and pick a card!

1:39:33.717 --> 1:39:36.011
Stop fucking around!

1:39:36.679 --> 1:39:39.348
Mekama. Let's establish a time limit.

1:39:39.431 --> 1:39:41.558
It'll never end at this rate.

1:39:44.144 --> 1:39:47.481
Mr. Sadakuni has made a request.
What shall we do?

1:39:49.983 --> 1:39:53.362
Very well. From now on,
every time a card is drawn,

1:39:53.445 --> 1:39:55.447
it must be done within one minute.

1:39:55.531 --> 1:39:57.658
Do you agree, Mr. Madarame?

1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:00.786
That's fine.

1:40:01.495 --> 1:40:02.913
Go ahead.

1:40:04.581 --> 1:40:07.626
Sada, I see right through your habits.

1:40:07.710 --> 1:40:08.836
Then--

1:40:08.919 --> 1:40:11.630
Hurry up and draw a card, right?

1:40:11.714 --> 1:40:14.591
-Here you go, Mr. Yako.
-Indeed.

1:40:14.675 --> 1:40:16.385
Don't even bother looking!

1:40:28.856 --> 1:40:29.857
Sada.

1:40:31.024 --> 1:40:33.277
We aren't playing Old Maid anymore.

1:40:33.861 --> 1:40:36.029
I will not be drawing the old maid again.

1:40:39.950 --> 1:40:44.705
In other words, the one who gets
the old maid in the beginning is dead.

1:40:46.248 --> 1:40:49.960
You better pray to your God
that you don't get the old maid.

1:40:56.049 --> 1:41:01.346
SADAKUNI 7/11, MADARAME 10/11

1:41:01.430 --> 1:41:02.639
SADAKUNI: FOUR REMAINING
MADARAME: ONE REMAINING

1:41:02.723 --> 1:41:03.807
Here you are.

1:41:04.975 --> 1:41:10.481
ROUND SIX

1:41:15.861 --> 1:41:19.448
The old maid. Baku has it!

1:41:24.077 --> 1:41:25.954
Madarame starts.

1:41:31.210 --> 1:41:32.544
Begin.

1:42:07.704 --> 1:42:09.414
Hurry up and put up your cards.

1:42:09.498 --> 1:42:11.667
What's the hurry?

1:42:19.174 --> 1:42:23.637
Okay, Sada. Take this card.

1:42:27.516 --> 1:42:30.435
Come on. Pick one.

1:42:31.478 --> 1:42:33.188
Mr. Sadakuni.

1:42:33.856 --> 1:42:35.983
Ten seconds remaining.

1:42:36.775 --> 1:42:39.027
Eight, seven,

1:42:39.111 --> 1:42:42.072
six, five,

1:42:42.155 --> 1:42:44.700
four, three,

1:42:44.783 --> 1:42:47.870
two, one.

1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:56.461
Sadakuni drew the old maid again.

1:42:56.545 --> 1:42:59.006
What happened?

1:43:00.382 --> 1:43:03.427
Goddammit!

1:43:06.930 --> 1:43:10.309
Sada, I'm going to fully
make use of the one minute

1:43:10.392 --> 1:43:12.603
you so generously gave me.

1:43:14.521 --> 1:43:17.566
Come and get it!

1:43:17.649 --> 1:43:19.902
Come on!

1:43:23.697 --> 1:43:25.949
<i>Baku, what are you doing?</i>

1:43:27.743 --> 1:43:29.494
Professor!

1:43:29.578 --> 1:43:33.081
I believe I explained
the rules at the start.

1:43:33.790 --> 1:43:36.752
Sharing of information
during the game is not allowed.

1:43:36.835 --> 1:43:41.465
However, as long as it's not discovered
by your opponent, underhanded tactics

1:43:41.548 --> 1:43:44.593
are of no concern to Kakero.

1:44:01.068 --> 1:44:07.157
You drew the old maid, didn't you?

1:44:15.707 --> 1:44:18.877
Huh? You figured it out?

1:44:21.296 --> 1:44:25.008
You can see my cards
through that camera, can't you?

1:44:34.685 --> 1:44:36.395
Professor!

1:44:56.289 --> 1:44:58.500
Is Sadakuni…?

1:44:59.084 --> 1:45:04.464
Does that mean he had somehow intercepted
the camera feed for the owners?

1:45:10.053 --> 1:45:12.597
You finally figured it out?

1:45:15.225 --> 1:45:17.769
I win, Sadakuni.

1:45:18.937 --> 1:45:20.731
No way.

1:45:20.814 --> 1:45:24.401
Amazing! We made a complete comeback!

1:45:24.484 --> 1:45:27.612
Baku!

1:45:27.696 --> 1:45:31.033
Kaji, it's thanks to you
for breaking that camera!

1:45:31.116 --> 1:45:35.328
-You're definitely the ultimate lucky boy!
-Baku!

1:45:35.996 --> 1:45:37.372
Yeah!

1:45:43.545 --> 1:45:46.506
Mr. Sadakuni drew the Old Maid Five.

1:45:47.632 --> 1:45:50.052
His hangman gallows are complete!

1:45:51.428 --> 1:45:53.013
The winner of this game…

1:45:54.222 --> 1:45:57.684
is Baku Madarame!

1:45:59.519 --> 1:46:00.896
Yes!

1:46:10.489 --> 1:46:11.782
The gallows are ready!

1:46:19.581 --> 1:46:22.667
You're completely blind, aren't you?

1:46:24.211 --> 1:46:27.714
Sadakuni used the six cameras above us

1:46:28.298 --> 1:46:31.551
to see both my cards and his.

1:46:32.594 --> 1:46:36.973
<i>So even when he was choosing the game</i>
<i>with a blindfold on, he saw everything.</i>

1:46:38.725 --> 1:46:40.769
You rebuilt your sight, right?

1:46:41.353 --> 1:46:43.230
With artificial vision.

1:46:43.855 --> 1:46:44.940
I believe

1:46:45.565 --> 1:46:49.111
it's a system using electricidal
stimulation on the optic nerves

1:46:50.028 --> 1:46:53.657
to restore eyesight to blind people
through another object.

1:46:54.407 --> 1:46:59.496
<i>He likely had someone hack into</i>
<i>the cameras and relay them to Sadakuni.</i>

1:47:09.881 --> 1:47:11.633
And this…

1:47:13.593 --> 1:47:15.387
is the proof.

1:47:20.767 --> 1:47:26.481
But one of the six cameras
was destroyed by the gun.

1:47:32.112 --> 1:47:34.364
So I watched.

1:47:35.115 --> 1:47:38.660
The view rotates through
each camera every ten seconds.

1:47:38.743 --> 1:47:43.665
So I began to wonder what happens
for Sadakuni when it gets to that camera.

1:47:45.750 --> 1:47:47.961
Since it's broken, there's no video.

1:47:57.012 --> 1:48:00.473
It was supposed to be the perfect plan.

1:48:01.057 --> 1:48:03.935
"Having the guts to throw
your life away," he said.

1:48:11.651 --> 1:48:15.614
You're just a big, fat liar!

1:48:26.208 --> 1:48:27.250
What are you doing?

1:48:27.834 --> 1:48:30.629
I choose to protect Sadakuni.

1:48:32.130 --> 1:48:34.507
You'll have to get through me first.

1:49:09.876 --> 1:49:14.297
You don't have the strength.

1:49:19.886 --> 1:49:21.846
<i>Hangman!</i>

1:49:21.930 --> 1:49:24.474
<i>Hangman!</i>

1:49:24.557 --> 1:49:27.852
<i>-Hangman!</i>
<i>-Hangman!</i>

1:49:27.936 --> 1:49:29.854
<i>Hangman!</i>

1:49:29.938 --> 1:49:31.273
<i>Hangman!</i>

1:49:32.649 --> 1:49:33.900
Ruka.

1:49:37.404 --> 1:49:39.990
Don't embarrass me further.

1:49:40.073 --> 1:49:41.366
Professor.

1:49:44.828 --> 1:49:46.746
I will accept the punishment.

1:49:48.206 --> 1:49:50.625
That's the rule of this world.

1:49:53.628 --> 1:49:55.547
Understood.

1:49:56.423 --> 1:49:57.841
Very well.

1:49:58.967 --> 1:50:00.927
Let us proceed to Hangman.

1:50:02.762 --> 1:50:04.306
Bring them over.

1:50:10.603 --> 1:50:13.315
Let go. I can get there myself.

1:50:25.744 --> 1:50:26.870
Lie Eater.

1:50:30.457 --> 1:50:33.376
Why do you want to be a Royal Leader?

1:50:34.669 --> 1:50:36.338
World peace.

1:50:41.134 --> 1:50:43.094
Hey, don't laugh!

1:50:44.387 --> 1:50:46.348
Sorry.

1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:49.934
Is that so?

1:50:50.018 --> 1:50:51.728
World peace?

1:50:56.816 --> 1:51:01.154
I'll be looking forward to it.

1:51:07.035 --> 1:51:11.289
I transfer my Kakero membership to you.

1:51:15.126 --> 1:51:16.669
Seriously?

1:51:16.753 --> 1:51:21.132
Oh, dear. You can't
just do that without asking.

1:51:21.216 --> 1:51:22.926
Lie Eater.

1:51:23.510 --> 1:51:27.972
I'm leaving it to you
to become a Royal Leader.

1:51:32.227 --> 1:51:33.561
Okay.

1:52:04.968 --> 1:52:06.511
Sadakuni.

1:53:01.774 --> 1:53:05.945
ONE YEAR LATER

1:53:45.527 --> 1:53:47.237
Thank you for waiting.

1:53:48.488 --> 1:53:50.865
The Royal Leader is waiting.

1:54:08.466 --> 1:54:11.344
At this point, only Mr. Baku may proceed.

1:54:15.974 --> 1:54:17.308
<i>Adios.</i>

1:54:18.685 --> 1:54:20.478
<i>Adios.</i>

1:54:25.775 --> 1:54:27.360
Well…

1:54:28.861 --> 1:54:30.154
I'm off.

1:54:52.343 --> 1:54:56.014
Let's get this started, Royal Leader.

1:54:57.223 --> 1:55:00.393
So, what are we betting on?

1:55:09.319 --> 1:55:12.071
Duck duck goose
with a handkerchief? So juvenile.

1:55:14.991 --> 1:55:16.618
Royal Leader.

1:55:18.995 --> 1:55:20.955
You're the best.

1:55:29.923 --> 1:55:31.591
I'm going to eat…

1:55:33.051 --> 1:55:34.886
your lie.
