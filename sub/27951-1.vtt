story, about how I met someone remarkable.</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:43.495
[pilot] <i>We would like to
welcome you to Savanna.</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.669
<i>The temperature on the ground is 70 degrees,
and the local time is...</i>

00:46.838 --> 00:50.172
[background music]

00:50.384 --> 00:52.384
[protagonist] <i>I'd just flown
in for a job interview.</i>

00:52.553 --> 00:54.419
<i>I had already
prepaid for my come-pick car,</i>

00:54.638 --> 00:57.051
<i>when the rental place
had a water main break.</i>

00:57.266 --> 00:59.911
[phone voice] <i>I'm sorry sir, we are going
to have to cancel your reservation.</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:04.099
[protagonist] <i>The car rental lot had flooded.
I didn't have time for this.</i>

01:04.313 --> 01:06.751
<i>I was already running a little late,
and I was trying to remember my answers</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:08.732
<i>to all the pre-interview
questions I'd practiced,</i>

01:08.944 --> 01:10.856
<i>so I had them drop me
off at the closest place.</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:14.314
Excuse me, can you pull over?
Excuse me.

01:14.533 --> 01:18.402
[protagonist] <i>Then suddenly,
I was standing in front of her.</i>

01:18.620 --> 01:20.703
[Susan] Thank y <i>o</i> u for
choosing Savanna Car Rentals.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.995
How can I help...

01:23.875 --> 01:26.195
[protagonist] <i>I can't remember
which one of us smiled first.</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:27.837
Hi.

01:27.839 --> 01:29.579
Hi.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.960
I just want to get a car.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.467
Okay.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.294
That's me, yeah.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.221
July 10th?

01:40.517 --> 01:43.305
I'm May 10th.
What are the chances?

01:43.478 --> 01:47.472
[protagonist] <i>Actually, the chances
are one in 30, but that didn't matter.</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:49.307
<i>We both could
feel something happening.</i>

01:49.526 --> 01:51.313
Cool.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.236
[protagonist] <i>By the end of my
first four hours in Savanna,</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:57.612
<i>I had a job,
and more importantly,</i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.112
<i>I had a date.</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:06.540
<i>A little less than a year
later, we were married,</i>

02:06.752 --> 02:10.496
<i>and to think, it all happened because
some guy working for Savanna Water</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:12.125
forgot to regulate the pressure.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.799
[laughter]

02:23.018 --> 02:25.305
[Nate] Every time,
I think we should remodel.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.184
- [Susan] I speak up and say, "We have to go to Paris."
- Great, then let's go to Paris.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.062
And then I wake up the next morning,
and say, "we have to remodel".

02:32.277 --> 02:35.361
- [laughter]
- We've been trying to decide

02:35.572 --> 02:37.905
if we want to put
in a new pool in the backyard,

02:38.116 --> 02:40.574
or take that trip to Cabo.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.403
I'm very glad that we decided
that we are going to do the pool.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.449
Honey, I thought
we decided on Cabo?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.953
Yes, right.
No, we are going to Cabo.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.755
- [Jan] We are going to Cab <i>o.</i>
- [Dan] Brain fart. Wow.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.208
- [doorbell rings]
- That must be Katie and Chuck.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.464
There are the wines.
She's white, he's red.

03:01.264 --> 03:05.008
- Hi.
- [cries]

03:05.227 --> 03:06.968
Katie, are you okay?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.100
- Where's Chuck?
- [cries]

03:10.273 --> 03:14.142
That's why all these jobs are moving to
Florida and Texas. There's no state income tax.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.525
- [Dan] A part of me has always wanted to live in Texas.
- All those tornadoes,

03:17.739 --> 03:20.231
it's so dangerous.
- Then, how about Florida?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.191
Florida is great.
It's right next door.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.611
Well, they have a lot of hurricanes...
It's... [chuckles]

03:24.788 --> 03:26.529
Not to mention the humidity.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.535
- It's...
- [Katie cries]

03:28.709 --> 03:31.747
We were supposed to go
to Florida this summer.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.960
His sister's getting married.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.713
We have the plane tickets
already, and the hotel, and my...

03:40.846 --> 03:45.466
My... bridesmaid's dress,

03:45.684 --> 03:49.303
and he even said,
it was going to be like our second honeymoon.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.598
But then he screwed
a girl he met online.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.358
Katie, would you like
to lie down or...

04:00.574 --> 04:01.655
Guys, I'm fine.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.577
[sighs]

04:13.754 --> 04:16.666
I'm going to be
a divorce wedding planner.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.627
That's great.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.755
More Syrah, anyone?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.427
- [Jan] Yes.
- [Dan] Yes.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.638
[Sabrina] Yes, okay.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.923
[Dan] Jan might have some Xanax.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.592
Steve and Sabrina
just liked our photo.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.224
[smirks] - They just said,
where's their invite?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.932
- I've always liked them.
- Yes, they are nice. We haven't seen them in a while.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.484
We should invite them
to the next barbecue.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.237
Maybe we can have a cookout competition.
He's always bragging about his brisket.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.066
- It's not that good.
- No, it's too dry.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.996
- No way.
- What?

04:53.293 --> 04:56.161
Chuck just changed
his status to single.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.666
- He did?
- Yes.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.750
Well, that is disgusting.
You should unfriend him.

05:03.345 --> 05:07.680
- No, okay.
- It's up to you.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.178
Only do it if it's
what you really want.

05:16.650 --> 05:23.614
[background music]

06:20.505 --> 06:23.088
[Colin] If we go, I'll buy
you the first three rounds.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.213
- If he doesn't go, you owe me.
- [Jake] I could take that.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.188
- Prove me right, Nate.
- No, prove me wrong.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.338
We've got an extra ticket
for the game tonight.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.723
He thinks if we
offered to you, you won't go.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.494
- He thinks you will.
- It's the first three rounds on the winner.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.522
- Guys, I can't.
- [laughter] There it is.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.413
- Victory.
- I would love to, but I can't. Tonight, I've got plans...

06:42.569 --> 06:45.061
Susan, steak, chips,
game shows waiting at home?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.569
[laughs] That was last night actually.
No, tonight's remodeling shows.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.617
Susan and I are re-doing the new bathroom.
She'd kill me if I missed it,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.820
but I'll go
with you guys next time.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.873
You realize you tell us that
every single week, right?

06:57.083 --> 07:00.003
Look, it's cool. Just tell us you'd
rather go home and hang with your wife.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.795
- We'll stop asking.
- No, it's just... If I start going out on a guys' night,

07:04.007 --> 07:06.875
then she'll start going on girls nights,
and then before you know it,

07:07.093 --> 07:08.834
I'm only going to
see her on the weekends.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.424
- And that's wrong because?
- Weekends are for projects.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.603
- Projects?
- Yes, mowing the lawn, painting the trim, building a new deck.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.807
Look, Susan and I made a commitment
to make our commitment work,

07:23.026 --> 07:25.109
- and you know what that takes?
- Masochistic guilt?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.482
No, it takes commitment.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.610
When you guys find
the right relationship,

07:30.825 --> 07:33.488
you'll love that commitment.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.660
No, man, you're right.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.491
You're right. I mean, we are
just gonna go to the game,

07:39.709 --> 07:42.629
we're going to get hammered, we're going
to probably embarrass ourselves...

07:42.796 --> 07:45.459
- Yes.
- ...in front of some coeds.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.500
But you, you'd rather go home to your wife.
That's amazing.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.675
- Yes.
- Seriously, man.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.972
- You're kind of lucky.
- I tell myself that every day.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.983
[voice on tv] <i>Just to clean down these walls.
Free it up from all the...</i>

07:58.103 --> 08:00.891
That is a great idea f <i>o</i> r
a backsplash. What do you think?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.428
I don't know. What do you think?

08:04.317 --> 08:08.277
- Maybe.
- Yes, maybe.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.607
- L <i>o</i> ve you.
- Love you, too.

08:14.327 --> 08:19.163
[Dan] Well, we want to do the infinity
pool because it looks amazing, but...

08:19.374 --> 08:22.287
[doorbell rings] - Grab your glasses.
He's Riesling, she's champagne.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.418
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.342
I can't eat it.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.341
I thought you loved cheesecake?

08:34.556 --> 08:38.015
I do, but I made
a deal with Deborah.

08:38.226 --> 08:42.311
She stops using her passive-aggressive
manipulation to make me go visit her mother,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.559
and I lose ten pounds.

08:46.109 --> 08:49.568
Well, eh,
commitment takes compromise.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.988
No, it takes ignorance.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.192
- What's this?
- Some event the city's hosting.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.119
They're looking for a design
for the new concert hall.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.242
- Cool, are you g <i>o</i> ing?
- Christ.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.077
I wish, but I've got
Deborah's third annual

09:05.295 --> 09:09.630
organic guacamole competition that she
hosts every year with her sisters.

09:09.841 --> 09:13.300
- That sounds fun.
- Yes, if you don't have a dick.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.965
You should go to that though. They have
free food, free booze, and who knows,

09:19.184 --> 09:22.518
you might even get
inspired to design something.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.936
- Right.
- [phone buzzing]

09:28.151 --> 09:29.892
It's the wife.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.068
Time to compromise.

09:38.161 --> 09:42.246
- Hey.
- Hey, I left some frosting off the list this morning,

09:42.415 --> 09:46.284
so can you pick some up?
It's in aisle three, next to the flour.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.586
Yes, but frosting for what?

09:48.797 --> 09:52.006
I told Dan and Jan that we
would bring a cake on Friday.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.630
- Nate?
- Yes, sorry.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.965
Do we really want to go to that?

10:01.184 --> 10:04.518
I mean, it's just to celebrate the first
day of construction on the new pool.

10:04.729 --> 10:09.144
- What else w <i>o</i> uld we d <i>o</i> ?
- Well, I was thinking,

10:09.359 --> 10:14.229
the city is hosting this event to find
architects to design the new concert hall

10:14.447 --> 10:16.592
and, I don't know, I thought
it sounded like it could be fun.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.857
[car alarms]

10:18.076 --> 10:21.990
- Susan?
- Yes. No, I mean, we could go,

10:22.205 --> 10:25.869
but last time we went to one of those
things you were bored out of your mind

10:26.084 --> 10:29.077
and you made me promise
that we would never go again.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.289
Besides, we already told
Dan and Jan we would be there.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.751
You know what?
It was unbearable.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.963
Intolerable, but it's up to you.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.093
I'll only do it
if it's what you really want.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.890
[car alarms]

10:47.480 --> 10:49.312
- [door closes]
- [Nate] Hello.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.229
- [Susan cries]
- [Nate] Susan?

10:59.325 --> 11:02.409
- What's wrong?
- [Susan] It just hit me, okay?

11:02.620 --> 11:06.284
This wave of emotion,
this feeling

11:07.333 --> 11:09.165
and I don't know
how to describe it,

11:09.377 --> 11:12.620
but every part of me realize
that every part of me is just...

11:12.839 --> 11:14.876
Unhappy?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.172
Miserable.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.221
Miserable?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.641
Miserable?
How is that even possible?

11:25.810 --> 11:30.475
One minute I'm on the phone and we're debating
what to do Friday night and then the next,

11:30.690 --> 11:33.774
you tell me that you're miserable.
How the fuck is that even possible?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.521
It just is, okay?

11:36.654 --> 11:40.193
No, no, listen to me.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.572
Let's talk about this.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.946
What can we do?

11:47.165 --> 11:51.660
What can I do to fix this?

11:52.629 --> 11:53.870
I wish I knew.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.507
[soft music]

12:02.222 --> 12:05.215
[protagonist] <i>I really think I just
needed to put this all in perspective.</i>

[door slams]

12:07.977 --> 12:11.095
<i>I mean, what marriage didn't
have a little bump in the road?</i>

12:11.314 --> 12:12.646
<i>A hill to climb.</i>

12:15.235 --> 12:18.194
I figured that when our friends
<i>heard about this Friday night,</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:20.691
<i>they'd cut the cake
and toast to Nate's night out.</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:32.496
- Good morning.
- Oh my. Nate, what the hell are you doing?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.498
I just thought we could talk.
I brought us some coffee.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.713
Okay, but don't just
barge in on me when I'm naked.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.319
What are you talking about?
I've seen you naked a thousand times.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.008
I don't get
what the big deal is.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.462
Look, we're having some issues

12:44.681 --> 12:46.923
and I don't want
to complicate things.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.476
I don't have any issues.
You said you were unhappy. I'm not unhappy.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.932
- I love our life, our marriage, getting to sleep in my own bed.
- I know.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.484
- I feel different, okay?
- Different?

13:02.699 --> 13:03.699
Better.

13:05.034 --> 13:09.404
- What do you mean, better?
- What do you think I mean?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.284
Do you want me to lie to you?

13:12.375 --> 13:13.866
Maybe.

13:15.295 --> 13:19.130
But the fourth wife,
she was a real looker.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.957
We both got our
money's worth on that one.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.590
So, do you think you, uh,
could ever get married again?

13:25.805 --> 13:29.264
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't think so. I'm...

13:29.475 --> 13:31.933
I'm so unlucky.
If it were raining pussies,

13:32.145 --> 13:35.013
the one that would land on my head
would have a dick already in it.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.062
All right, moving on.

13:40.236 --> 13:45.948
Ed, how about you, any movement
with your action items this week?

13:46.159 --> 13:51.450
Yes. I finally got rid of that
hyphen at the end of my name,

13:52.707 --> 13:57.418
so I'm no longer Ed Smith-Myers.
I'm just Ed Smith.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.711
Congratulations, Ed.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.964
You're making real progress.
I'm proud of you.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.844
Nate, how about you?

14:11.059 --> 14:12.766
Would you like
to share with the group?

14:17.357 --> 14:20.441
Hi, I'm Nate.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.982
I just came
to check this out because

14:28.201 --> 14:30.989
American Voices
is finished for this season,

14:31.204 --> 14:34.072
so I had a little bit
of extra time this week.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.787
I don't really
know what I'm doing here.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.207
[typing on keyboard]

14:50.014 --> 14:52.347
[computer beeps]

15:35.059 --> 15:38.143
[customer] I know, I got really lucky,
I was able to get an earlier flight.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.064
It means we can definitely make
it to Peter and Penny's potluck.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.232
Yes, yes,
I'll pick up a bottle of Syrah.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.243
You look like the expert.
Are the waffles here any good?

15:55.288 --> 15:59.373
Are the waffles here any go <i>o</i> d?
Yes, yes, they're okay.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.753
I had better. My wife actually
makes really good waffles.

16:04.964 --> 16:10.005
Wholegrain, soy milk, egg whites and
we only use grade A maple syrup,

16:10.219 --> 16:12.757
medium amber in the little
maple leaf bottle from Vermont.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.805
Susan has this way of pouring the
maple syrup into every other square,

16:19.020 --> 16:21.387
there's never too much
but never too little.

16:21.606 --> 16:26.271
She would even take the butter out of the
fridge an hour before we ate so it softens,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.945
then when it hits the top of the waffle,
it just melts in every direction.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.447
I bet you can't
wait to get home.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.795
[knocks]

16:47.632 --> 16:50.591
[Dan] I placed the Blueridge mountain,
the problem is we got to use it.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.418
- [Jan] We go back and forth and I say...
- Hey, Nate.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.676
- [Jan] I have to go to Asheville and he says...
- [Dan] How's it going?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.383
- I feel like it's been a while.
- Yes, it has, hasn't it?

16:59.602 --> 17:02.470
We cannot decide. [laughs]

17:04.147 --> 17:07.607
Nate, what a surprise.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.269
Yes, it is a surprise, isn't it?

17:10.488 --> 17:15.825
You're having a dinner party with all
our friends as if nothing even happened.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.527
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm really good.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.079
Thanks f <i>o</i> r asking.
I'm getting along just swell.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.374
I'm really glad that you're making
good use of our time apart.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.248
The space that you wanted so bad
is treating you well. Then hey,

17:27.463 --> 17:30.623
- it's just shits and giggles here at my expense, isn't it?
- It's not like that,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.213
- let's just go upstairs and talk.
- Holy shit.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.843
Is that the new 65-inch 4K HDTV
with crystal clear pixilation,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.721
the one that I wanted to get
instead of redoing the bathroom?

17:41.936 --> 17:45.270
[Nick] Okay, the rocking ribs

17:45.481 --> 17:50.476
are ready to be tasted.
Who wants some more pinot?

17:51.696 --> 17:56.532
Oh. Hey, how's it going?
I'm Nick. Good to meet you.

17:58.786 --> 18:03.201
- What's your name?
- My name is Nate Brown.

18:03.416 --> 18:07.706
- Nate Brown.
- It's on the mail that comes here. It's on the cable bill.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.148
- Nate, can we please just talk about this...
- You know what?

18:10.172 --> 18:13.040
It's really not the fact that you're
screwing my wife that bothers me,

18:13.259 --> 18:16.093
because honestly, that I
could get over, but Susan,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.050
if y <i>o</i> u're going to let this guy
wear my "kiss the cook" apron,

18:19.265 --> 18:22.849
use my dripless basting brush and
cook in my 44-inch combo grill,

18:23.060 --> 18:26.599
then I'm sorry, but you're
nothing but a filthy whore.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.056
[door slams]

18:29.275 --> 18:32.814
I'm just having a really hard time
adjusting to everything right now.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.692
- Hard, h <i>o</i> w?
- Well...

18:35.906 --> 18:40.150
I... I just feel like my whole
life is turned upside down, right?

18:40.369 --> 18:43.953
And I don't know
where to start, you know.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.454
I'm also dealing with some
pretty big issues at the moment

18:48.669 --> 18:51.753
like not being allowed back into my
own house that I bought and paid for.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.129
But then, there's also like the little things
that bother me even more than being homeless.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.927
Like I passed our Thai
food place the other night.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.882
We loved Thai food,
it was our favorite and every time we'd go,

19:03.100 --> 19:06.889
I would get the chicken skewers and she would
get the garlic beef and then we'd share.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.104
And it's like...

19:10.107 --> 19:12.724
What the fuck
am I supposed to do now?

19:12.902 --> 19:15.485
I mean, I can't get both.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.696
Hey.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.279
It's just
going to take some time.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.656
How long have
you been coming here?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.453
15 years.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.458
I would've gone to Paris.

19:34.632 --> 19:38.421
No, she remodels.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.845
[Katie] Nate?

19:43.474 --> 19:44.806
Nate Brown.

19:45.976 --> 19:50.095
It's Katie, Katie Franco,

19:51.982 --> 19:55.066
- used to be Hamilton.
- Oh, Katie.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.270
Katie, hi!

19:58.489 --> 20:00.196
What the hell happened to you?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.070
I'll take that as a compliment.

20:02.284 --> 20:06.654
And you look
like you always did.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.582
Really? Because half of me
is divorcing the other half.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.752
- Aw, you too?
- M-hm.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.165
So, what are you up to now?

20:18.384 --> 20:21.673
You still helping the betrothed
march to their emotional death?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.879
- God, no.
- Really?

20:24.098 --> 20:26.385
That... that was your life.
You lived for it.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.719
No, I had what could
be innocently described

20:30.938 --> 20:34.306
as a complete fucking meltdown
where I lost my cool on a customer

20:34.525 --> 20:36.892
to the point where
they called off the engagement.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.652
Probably good you quit.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.277
Are you kidding? It was
like the best day of my life.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.984
I... suddenly felt
empowered and inspired

20:46.203 --> 20:49.412
and it allowed me to shed the past
and take hold of my own life.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.790
I thought from that moment on

20:56.005 --> 20:58.167
of my breakup as my wakeup,

20:58.382 --> 21:02.251
as the moment in my life when
I said, "I am my own person.

21:02.470 --> 21:06.305
I'm not just half of Katie
and Chuck. I'm Katie Franco."

21:06.515 --> 21:10.885
and the fun of the single thing is starting
over. Don't commiserate, celebrate.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.516
- What is there to celebrate?
- You.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.723
Your newfound freedom,
your independence.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.434
- The new life you're about to embark on.
- Celebrate being single?

21:22.782 --> 21:25.240
My... my marriage
was everything to me.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.161
Operative word: <i>Was.</i>
You got to start living in the now.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.158
- Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past?

21:31.332 --> 21:33.198
- Seize your future.
- Carpe diem?

21:33.417 --> 21:36.330
Listen, you guys
planned a wedding, right?

21:37.421 --> 21:40.255
That was just one big party.
Why don't you throw another one?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.916
I don't know,
I guess I could try.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.257
I just don't know if I could pull it off.
Seems like a lot to celebrate just <i>moi.</i>

21:48.974 --> 21:51.307
Who else would
you rather celebrate?

21:54.355 --> 21:57.473
Well, listen.
Call me if you need me.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.432
I'm back to being an accountant.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.269
Taxes after
a divorce can be a bit tricky.

22:07.993 --> 22:11.077
[typing on keyboard]

22:11.288 --> 22:12.288
Cele...

22:12.331 --> 22:13.947
...brate.

22:19.713 --> 22:23.332
7:00 p.m.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.346
[Susan]
This is so out of character.

22:34.562 --> 22:37.555
I'm honestly surprised
he came up with it himself.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.730
Really? You think?

22:39.942 --> 22:44.653
If that was my ex-husband,
I... I would sabotage the party

22:44.822 --> 22:48.406
and make a complete ass out of him in
front of all of his loser friends.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.781
Hypothetically
speaking, you know.

22:51.996 --> 22:56.036
[laughs] Jan loves
her little hypotheticals.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.833
- You know, I just... Throwing a party is hard.
- It's tough.

22:59.044 --> 23:03.664
It's not just buying a six-pack
and serving some onion dip,

23:03.883 --> 23:06.091
it's... it's a lot more,
you know.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.545
I always planned who's
coming and what we would serve

23:09.763 --> 23:11.675
and where they
would sit, you know?

23:13.142 --> 23:15.099
I always made him
feel like he was involved.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.304
Yeah, he always had those amazing
syrupy sweet and spicy ribs.

23:18.522 --> 23:23.517
- Seriously? It was seriously not syrupy.
- Misspoke.

23:23.736 --> 23:29.198
And if I hadn't added white pepper to
the rub, it would have been bland.

23:29.408 --> 23:33.823
And if I didn't constantly baste the ribs,
it would've burned.

23:34.038 --> 23:38.829
If I didn't serve merlot, he
would've served chardonnay, so.

23:39.043 --> 23:42.627
- That would not have gone...
- You can't do that.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.579
After the term alimony?

23:46.008 --> 23:48.671
Permanent alimony.

23:50.012 --> 23:55.428
Her pension contribution
entitlement, her car insurance.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.767
Her healthcare coverage.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.598
I see 17% of my salary.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.268
One-seven.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.527
No wonder I feel 83% like shit.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.119
The irony?

24:18.207 --> 24:22.872
Before our first date,
I dreamed of fucking her

24:26.090 --> 24:28.332
and now she's fucking me.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.086
Right up the ass.

24:33.597 --> 24:37.216
Okay. Uh...

24:37.434 --> 24:40.973
Anyone else have
anything they'd like to add?

24:42.690 --> 24:44.352
I have something.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.521
Uhm...

24:49.571 --> 24:53.440
I was actually trying to think about
this divorce thing in a whole new way.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.492
So instead of
feeling like shit about it,

24:56.704 --> 24:59.822
I decided why not have a party?

25:00.040 --> 25:05.877
I'm... I'm sorry,
why not have a what?

25:06.088 --> 25:07.499
A divorce party.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.547
Nate...

25:10.759 --> 25:15.174
I... I think
that might be misdirecting

25:15.389 --> 25:17.756
some of the pain
that you're feeling.

25:17.975 --> 25:21.685
Yeah, why would
you want to do that?

25:21.895 --> 25:24.478
I mean, you could think
about it any way you want,

25:24.690 --> 25:28.274
but you'd still be broadcasting
your failure to the world.

25:28.485 --> 25:32.354
We come in here to share
our lives with each other,

25:32.573 --> 25:34.735
but we keep it in this room.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.400
You want to share your
misery with the world?

25:37.619 --> 25:42.114
Fine, but for me,
I... I'd rather be safe in here,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.580
than deal with
what's going on out there.

25:47.421 --> 25:51.290
[radio playing]

25:53.093 --> 25:55.585
I need to understand how I,

25:55.804 --> 25:58.467
a guy that I think
is pretty normal, not offensive,

25:58.682 --> 26:03.097
only rarely loses his temper in public,
only has one guest attending his party.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.353
- What party?
- The divorce party.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.353
The one that you RSVP'd to?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.730
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.690
Well, first of all,
I RSVP yes to every invite.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.572
It doesn't mean I'm going, it
means that you think I'm going.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.622
So for the next week, if I see you at spin
class, you don't think I'm lame for saying no.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.124
Then, about an hour
before the party starts,

26:27.336 --> 26:30.044
I send you an email with
something along the lines of,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.248
"Oh my God,
I'm so sorry I can't make it.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.208
But do a sh <i>o</i> t f <i>o</i> r me.
Love you. Katie."

26:36.553 --> 26:38.215
So you weren't coming either?

26:38.388 --> 26:39.799
No, of course not.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.434
- Okay.
- Listen, Nate. I don't know what to tell you.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.013
You decided to throw a party and now you're
realizing that without your marriage,

26:48.232 --> 26:50.315
no one feels obligated
to show up just for you.

26:50.526 --> 26:51.607
Why not?

26:53.529 --> 26:56.290
Because you used to be half of something
and now you're all of nothing.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.904
- Don't you think that's kind of your fault?
- Oh, my fault?

27:00.077 --> 27:03.286
Yeah. I mean, you gave me the whole,
"Don't commiserate, celebrate" speech.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.989
Nate, please.
Look at your invite.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.827
Chips and dip at the Savannah Inn
Express isn't a party, it's pathetic.

27:11.505 --> 27:15.124
- I got the Double Deluxe Suite.
- Nate, if you want to have a successful divorce party,

27:15.342 --> 27:17.299
- y <i>o</i> u got to treat this as if...
- As if what?

27:17.511 --> 27:20.424
As if it was
as important as your wedding.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.553
Okay. Look, if I had 30 grand to
spend, I'd throw something cool,

27:24.768 --> 27:27.049
- but I don't have that kind of money.
- Are you telling me

27:27.104 --> 27:30.017
your new life is only worth a bag of
tortilla chips and a jar of salsa?

27:30.232 --> 27:31.973
Because that's what I'm hearing.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.481
Okay, think about it. If you
were getting married somehow,

27:35.696 --> 27:40.282
you and your over-eager bride would find the
money to flaunt your new life together, right?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.242
Why don't you throw it for me?

27:47.457 --> 27:48.789
What?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.243
I mean, you love doing that.
You lived for it.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.461
No.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.248
What I lived for
was a feeling, you know?

27:58.302 --> 28:01.761
The rush of making a memory that could
maybe carry somebody through a lifetime.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.681
Like...

28:05.309 --> 28:07.551
I was creating a piece of art,

28:09.438 --> 28:11.100
and I was the artist,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.609
but that was the past.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.065
Your specialty was sending
people off into the world,

28:19.281 --> 28:21.273
with the memory
of the best day of their lives.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.776
Help me have
a new best day of my life.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.323
Make me a work of art.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.740
Please?

28:37.591 --> 28:41.050
Okay. If you can find
the money to pay my full fee

28:41.261 --> 28:44.174
and allow me to plan something
with the bells and whistles

28:44.389 --> 28:48.224
that keeps my former reputation
intact, then I'll do it.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.020
Okay.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.100
[optimistic music playing]

29:12.042 --> 29:15.456
[door opens and closes]

29:25.847 --> 29:29.466
- [Susan] Okay, are we good?
- [Nick] Okay. All right.

29:29.685 --> 29:30.892
Look at that body.

29:35.649 --> 29:41.486
[Nick moaning] Fuck, yeah.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.278
[Nick] Ooh, yeah. Come on, baby.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.367
[grunts and laughs]

29:51.581 --> 29:54.619
Oh, Jesus Christ already!

29:54.835 --> 29:57.669
Nate! What the hell
are you doing here?

29:57.879 --> 30:00.542
Oh, my God.
I thought you'd be at work.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.216
There must be some reason, some urgent
need that absolutely could not wait.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.091
- Well, I need my tennis shoes.
- Your tennis shoes?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.844
Yeah, I looked in the closet and
on the shoe rack and I just...

30:10.058 --> 30:14.177
Yeah, dude, yeah
right behind my ab-roller.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.013
Yeah.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.350
Yes, little guy, huh?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.481
He's...

30:24.197 --> 30:27.156
Size eight and a half, right?

30:28.869 --> 30:31.657
Nine and a half. [clears throat]

30:31.872 --> 30:36.242
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

30:37.627 --> 30:42.088
[Nate] <i>There I was standing in front of my
soon to be ex and her buck naked boyfriend</i>

30:42.299 --> 30:46.885
<i>and it was clear,
the ring meant absolutely nothing to her.</i>

30:47.095 --> 30:51.806
It was like she was void of that gush of
emotion that she had when I proposed.

30:51.975 --> 30:57.391
I spent weeks, months even
researching the stupid four C's:

30:57.606 --> 31:00.349
cut, color, clarity, and carat.

31:00.567 --> 31:04.652
I organized a flash mob
for the perfect proposal.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.196
I even hired dancers
to present the ring.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.452
I mean, the fucking absurdity of
this invented tradition where men

31:12.662 --> 31:14.654
have to bust their ass

31:15.791 --> 31:19.455
and spend three months salary just
to express their undying devotion.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.955
I mean, when
the hell did that start?

31:24.174 --> 31:25.961
When men were stupid
enough to fall for it.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.635
I don't know, maybe
I should just give it back.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.931
Well, the courts look at an engagement
ring as a promise of a marriage,

31:34.142 --> 31:37.635
and that the bride fulfills that promise,
and your ex certainly did.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.722
It's supposedly hers,
free and clear.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.979
- You think I should return it?
- Hell no, it's a bullshit law.

31:44.194 --> 31:49.610
Hock that ring and you get as much
money for it as you can, fuck her.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.660
This is the Bridal Bible,
all my girls used to get one.

31:58.875 --> 32:04.212
It's the "how to" for the "I do" even if
we're celebrating the death of your marriage.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.759
Since you've been lost in the
delusional fairy tale of marriage,

32:09.970 --> 32:12.758
how about
something truly romantic?

32:12.973 --> 32:15.807
Maybe even a mask party where
we reveal the new Nate Brown.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.599
Hm? What do you think?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.311
[Nate] I don't know.

32:27.112 --> 32:32.153
How about this, you've got a sweeping
view of the water, what's not to love?

32:32.367 --> 32:35.610
And we could even do maybe like,
a little spiritual cleansing in the river.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.202
I don't know.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.926
I thought this could be the perfect place
to be loud and proud about your new life.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.430
What do you think?

32:56.183 --> 32:57.390
Maybe.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.684
What about something
exotic like Indian food?

33:03.899 --> 33:06.562
- We don't like Indian.
- What do you mean <i>we</i> ?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.318
I mean me.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.778
- [Nick] That is bitching.
- [Susan] Yeah, and if I serve that,

33:14.993 --> 33:16.780
everyone's going
to think I'm a huge a bitch.

33:16.995 --> 33:21.456
Maybe, it's cushy.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.578
It's cringe-worthy.

33:23.752 --> 33:27.086
I don't want people to think that I
have all of this pent-up emotions,

33:27.297 --> 33:30.005
this bitter pill that
I'm forcing them to swallow.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.674
This looks like
a Halloween cake.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.093
Besides, no one even
likes white icing, do they?

33:34.304 --> 33:37.297
I mean, it's just a cake.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.550
I set the seating at a 100.

33:41.770 --> 33:45.935
We can always adjust up if we
need to or down for that matter.

33:46.149 --> 33:50.109
I don't understand why we're working on a
seating chart when I don't have any guests yet.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.781
- That's exactly my point.
- And it's valid, but I don't have anyone to invite.

33:55.784 --> 33:59.573
All of my so-called friends were just
bodies that would come over two by two

33:59.788 --> 34:01.529
for bland wine
and safe conversation.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.034
Trust me, I remember that.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.663
Your revolving list
of couple friend guests.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.837
Listen, it doesn't matter,
because I'm pretty sure

34:08.004 --> 34:10.212
those people are going
to go to Susan's party anyways.

34:11.925 --> 34:15.543
Of course, she's having a party.
She lives for those things.

34:16.513 --> 34:22.350
Exactly, so why don't you let her live
her life while you go define yours.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.725
Go find some people
you actually want to be around.

34:27.857 --> 34:30.065
[Colin] 39 trees, 39.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.268
It's got to have greenery.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.315
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.822
Just wanted to see what you
guys were up to this weekend.

34:41.036 --> 34:45.452
See If you wanted to have some brewskis
or tease some tail or something.

34:45.667 --> 34:49.502
I'm sorry, tease some tail?

34:49.713 --> 34:52.456
Yeah, you know,
go out and just...

34:52.674 --> 34:55.007
Everything okay?

34:55.217 --> 34:57.210
Yeah, yeah,
everything's fine. I'm fine.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.967
- Well, better than fine.
- You don't have to lie.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.390
I'm not, lie about what?

35:03.602 --> 35:06.470
A guy's wife who's in my fantasy league,
who also take yoga with Jan,

35:06.688 --> 35:10.932
who apparently attends your dinner parties,
told us that Susan kicked you out.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.359
Why weren't we invited
to those dinner parties?

35:13.570 --> 35:16.734
We're just... We're
working through some issues.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.031
- She's divorcing you.
- That is one of the issues.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.282
Look, those dinner parties
were boring. I was bored.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.531
- You guys would have been bored.
- All right, look,

35:23.747 --> 35:26.285
we see through
your little charade here.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.832
Clearly, everything isn't
hunky dory in Brown manor

35:29.044 --> 35:32.082
and now that there's no Susan,
I'd say you're a little

35:33.465 --> 35:34.922
desperate to hang out with us.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.841
Desperate? I'm not desperate.

35:39.471 --> 35:43.135
- What do you think?
- We're going to that thing this weekend.

35:43.350 --> 35:48.812
[whispering]

35:48.980 --> 35:51.063
- All right, look. Here's the deal, dude, no.
- No.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.561
- Not in this condition.
- What condition?

35:53.777 --> 35:56.645
You're like a caged man
in the zoo of life,

35:56.863 --> 36:00.106
a sad little Panda cub that's
been protected behind bars,

36:00.325 --> 36:04.740
suckling milk from your mother's tits
and now, you don't have a mommy anymore.

36:04.954 --> 36:09.164
Trust us, this is for your own safety.
If we put you into the wild, you'd be killed.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.868
I can survive in the wild, okay?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.328
I can be a tiger.

36:14.464 --> 36:15.750
I can kill.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.470
- Seth. Hey, man.
- Good to see you.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.719
Heidi, what's up, baby?
Looking good.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.472
- Hey.
- Yo.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.685
Alright.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.528
Hi, just be cool, right? Mingle.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.411
[background chattering]

36:55.588 --> 37:00.253
It's good to be out, you know,
on my own, solo, kicking it.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.198
Not having to worry about what time I get
home tonight, so I can make some stupid

37:04.222 --> 37:06.885
brunch plans in the morning,
do you know what that's like?

37:07.100 --> 37:10.639
I mean, dude,
I spent so much time

37:10.854 --> 37:14.143
worrying about
Susan this, Susan that.

37:14.357 --> 37:18.192
Trying to keep her happy for her to turn
around one day and tell me that she's unhappy.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.815
What the fuck is up with that?

37:21.990 --> 37:24.482
[cheering]

37:25.243 --> 37:28.597
I mean it's okay. At least I'm not one of those
guys that has to talk about it all the time.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.987
- You know?
- All right, baby.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.573
Your turn to drink,
let's go, okay.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.626
Chug, chug, chug.

37:35.837 --> 37:39.421
[all] Chug, chug, chug.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.966
- [cheers]
- Chug.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.761
I got you. [laughs]

37:51.019 --> 37:54.683
Chad, badass rad Chad.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.728
What's up, motherfucker?

38:01.571 --> 38:06.862
[sighs] Hey dude,

38:07.076 --> 38:08.692
all kidding aside,

38:08.912 --> 38:11.996
- you're a really awesome guy, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.826
- Cool, man.
- I love you, buddy.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.161
Hey, we should
hang out sometime.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.333
What do you put in your hair,
too? How do you get it to...

38:23.551 --> 38:27.841
- What do you mean hang out?
- I don't mean that in a gay way.

38:28.056 --> 38:32.096
Like, I'm not trying to pick you up or
take you to like a homo bar or something.

38:32.310 --> 38:37.271
Right, so if you were, you know, trying
to pick me up, would that be a bad thing?

38:38.233 --> 38:39.940
No, that's what I'm saying.

38:41.945 --> 38:45.689
You're a really good
looking guy, but I'm not gay.

38:45.907 --> 38:49.196
- You know, I feel bad for the gays, though.
- Oh, yeah?

38:49.410 --> 38:53.029
Adopting children, and marriage
equality, and like...

38:56.042 --> 38:57.578
Fuck marriage, man.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.036
It's bad enough being
married to the opposite sex,

39:00.255 --> 39:03.339
why the fuck would you want
to be married to the same sex,

39:03.550 --> 39:04.836
you know what I mean?

39:08.513 --> 39:09.720
Sorry.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.429
[door closes]

39:19.023 --> 39:20.230
[Colin] Hey.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.185
Hey, guys.
Do you guys want a drink?

39:24.404 --> 39:27.442
- Fuck no, I don't want a drink.
- Why would you hit on Chad?

39:27.657 --> 39:30.115
- Yeah, what were you thinking?
- What do you mean?

39:31.327 --> 39:33.114
Oh, dude, come on. We're cool.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.868
Hey, Chad, Chad,
do you want a drink?

39:37.917 --> 39:41.160
- Watch, I got this.
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Yeah?

39:41.379 --> 39:43.712
Listen, I don't know
who the hell you think you are,

39:43.923 --> 39:47.363
but I think I speak for everyone here when I
tell you that it's time for you to go home.

39:53.850 --> 39:54.931
[curtains being pulled]

39:58.104 --> 40:00.721
[Katie] I think you're in
serious need of inspiration.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.853
- I think you need a date.
- A date?

40:04.068 --> 40:06.310
Yes,
not a girlfriend, not a wife,

40:06.529 --> 40:08.862
not someone
to help you plan everything.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.487
Just someone who might actually enjoy
your company during your divorce party.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.113
A date?

40:17.874 --> 40:20.582
- At least I have one person coming.
- Exactly,

40:20.793 --> 40:23.786
maybe a little momentum will
help figure everything else out.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.621
Where do you want me
to find somebody?

40:26.633 --> 40:29.376
I don't know if y <i>o</i> u know, but
I'm not the best at socializing.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.444
[music]

40:52.617 --> 40:57.328
It's strange, really.
If the flood hadn't delayed my flight...

40:57.497 --> 41:01.241
I would have been bored sitting there at my
laptop looking at dating sites. [laughs]

41:01.459 --> 41:02.995
I mean, what are the chances?

41:03.211 --> 41:04.747
Tell me more about yourself.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.797
Well, I've always
wanted to go to Ireland.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.964
It just...
it looks so pristine online.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.793
Which isn't t <i>o</i> say that I feel
the need to go jet-setting

41:13.012 --> 41:15.174
across the world all the time
or anything like that.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.554
I have this really
great couch at home.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.226
It's white. Shabby chic.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.349
So comfortable for watching TV.

41:23.564 --> 41:26.898
- It's just too big.
- Too big?

41:27.110 --> 41:29.477
Yes. I mean,
whether it's on the couch...

41:29.696 --> 41:31.483
- Or the beach...
- Or even on the moon...

41:31.698 --> 41:34.907
It's just not the same unless
someone's there by your side

41:35.118 --> 41:37.405
watching remodeling shows
with you.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.867
- Do you like your job?
- It's a job. That's all it is, really.

41:41.082 --> 41:45.998
I know I shouldn't feel that way
about my career, but I don't care.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.250
I told them I don't
want to go into management.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.252
Because I need time to live.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.379
To nurture
the relationships in my life.

41:53.594 --> 41:56.052
To find someone.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.437
- I want to bury it at the party.
- Want to get some

42:05.648 --> 42:09.358
flowers and a tombstone for it also?
- I'm serious, Nick.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.441
I want to do this.
I need to do this.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.319
I think it's going to be
really therapeutic, you know?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.947
It will help me just
get rid of the ring for good.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.779
- One final symbolic gesture.
- If you say so, baby.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.501
- Makes sense, right?
- Yeah, it makes sense to you, it makes sense to me.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.036
Great.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.167
[music]

42:38.723 --> 42:40.760
You've got to be kidding me.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.049
What are you doing?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.434
[turns video back on]

42:44.645 --> 42:46.682
Reliving
the best day of my life.

42:46.898 --> 42:50.642
Nate, the whole idea is to make your
divorce party your new best day.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.273
I don't want a new best day.
I just want to lie here

42:53.488 --> 42:55.445
until they find my corpse
fused to the comforter.

43:01.162 --> 43:04.576
What? What do you want?

43:04.791 --> 43:09.081
I hate to tell you,
but your bridal bible planning guide sucks.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.375
Finding a date was meant
to help me to get over Susan.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.673
Every girl felt like
some kind of version of Susan,

43:14.884 --> 43:17.684
- except they weren't Susan. Now I can't stop thinking about...
- Susan?

43:18.554 --> 43:23.174
Jesus Christ. Enough with your
whole misery routine. It's tiring.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.429
Then why was
everyone so much like her?

43:25.645 --> 43:27.102
Because of this.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.816
- How did you get that?
- I hacked into your account.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.816
- How do you know my password?
- It's Susan and the year you were married.

43:38.074 --> 43:42.694
You said, "Willing to adjust your
life goals for the right person."

43:42.912 --> 43:45.620
You prefer s <i>o</i> meone adverse
to breaking up after a year

43:45.832 --> 43:49.872
and are interested in exploring the
interest and hobbies of your next partner?

43:50.086 --> 43:52.248
So what? What's wrong with that?

43:52.463 --> 43:54.463
If someone really likes cycling,
there's no problem

43:54.674 --> 43:56.961
with me taking time out
of my day to do that with them.

43:57.176 --> 44:00.010
They want to go on a cruise ship to Mexico,
then sure, why not?

44:00.221 --> 44:03.635
- Something to do.
- Do you even like cycling? Or cruising?

44:03.850 --> 44:07.343
That's not the point. It shows that I'm
willing to meet them in the middle.

44:07.562 --> 44:11.522
Oh. Is that where you
want to live your life?

44:11.732 --> 44:12.813
In the middle?

44:14.193 --> 44:16.810
- Called compromise.
- No, it's called sacrifice.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.021
Giving up who you are
to be someone you're not.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.323
Sometimes that's what it takes.

44:21.534 --> 44:24.151
That's why Susan and I worked
so well for all those years.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.036
How's it working for you now?

44:39.177 --> 44:41.169
Okay, throw it in.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.505
- I don't want to.
- Do it.

44:44.724 --> 44:48.468
- No.
- Nate.

44:54.859 --> 44:58.569
- Listen, I kn <i>o</i> w how this feels.
- No, you don't.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.780
I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.331
I thought you got rid <i>o</i> f every
picture of you and Chuck?

45:18.841 --> 45:21.504
Believe me, I know this is hard.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.257
I know it better
than anyone else

45:24.430 --> 45:29.141
because you're not just letting go of the
past, but you have to let go of the future too.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.018
The future?

45:33.022 --> 45:36.015
The memories you've dreamed of
that you'll never share

45:36.192 --> 45:40.402
and the kids you won't know and the
Christmases you won't celebrate

45:42.448 --> 45:46.863
and growing old together.
You have to say goodbye to all of it.

45:48.913 --> 45:54.159
- Even if you know it was probably your fault.
- You don't blame Chuck?

45:54.377 --> 45:58.212
You know when people say, "It's not you,
it's me" and they're completely lying?

45:58.422 --> 46:02.211
Well, it actually was me.
In trying to make our relationship perfect,

46:02.426 --> 46:04.713
I completely suffocated him.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.894
Come on, Nate. You can do this.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.810
Start over.

46:40.381 --> 46:41.872
And your wedding picture.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.923
And your honeymoon picture.

47:03.487 --> 47:06.104
And the picture you keep in
your wallet behind your license

47:06.282 --> 47:09.025
next to the spare key that opens
the house that used to be yours.

47:09.243 --> 47:13.328
- How did you...
- You're like an addict. I had to search everything.

47:23.924 --> 47:24.924
Now, light it.

47:56.957 --> 47:57.957
[sighs]

47:58.959 --> 48:00.916
[sighs]

48:02.671 --> 48:03.912
[sighs]

48:23.275 --> 48:26.109
[Nate VO] <i>As the memories
of my past burned away,</i>

48:27.238 --> 48:31.448
<i>I couldn't help but wonder why
they've been so damn important to me.</i>

48:33.369 --> 48:35.110
<i>She was right all along.</i>

48:36.747 --> 48:38.784
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

48:38.999 --> 48:42.709
<i>The future holds
the memories of tomorrow</i>

48:42.920 --> 48:46.163
<i>and I was ready
to experience every single one.</i>

48:53.639 --> 48:56.973
[Katie] Okay, so my whole plan for
tonight is that you're no longer Nate.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.302
- Who am I?
- You're going to choose an alter ego and role play.

49:00.521 --> 49:03.810
Trust me, this works. I used it
whenever my brides were really nervous

49:04.024 --> 49:07.813
about their wedding. It breaks you out of
that shell and gives you that confidence

49:08.737 --> 49:11.070
that, frankly, you have
none of and desperately need.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.656
So, who do you think
I should be?

49:13.868 --> 49:16.406
Whoever you want to be.
It doesn't matter,

49:16.620 --> 49:21.081
but no matter who you choose to be, you have
to, and I mean have to, follow my two rules.

49:21.292 --> 49:24.876
- Okay.
- You cannot break character and you cannot talk about Susan.

49:25.087 --> 49:26.623
Susan who?

49:27.965 --> 49:30.298
How are we
getting into this thing?

49:30.509 --> 49:34.344
Didn't I tell you?
I RSVP to everything.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.716
Thank you.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.345
<i>Fromage.</i>

49:43.981 --> 49:45.313
Interesting.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.650
What do you think?

49:50.279 --> 49:52.942
[with French accent]
It's quite clever.

49:53.115 --> 49:56.153
I took several classes
at the École des Beaux-Arts.

49:56.368 --> 49:59.702
Modernism,
post-modernism, the avant-garde.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.331
How productive.

50:03.542 --> 50:08.788
Well, well, you should know the
tales of the life I've lived.

50:09.006 --> 50:12.670
Excuse me,
where in France are you from?

50:12.885 --> 50:14.592
We're going to Cannes next year.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.378
Really?

50:16.597 --> 50:18.805
I thought we'd
settled on Copenhagen.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.510
[clears throat]
I am from Normandy.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.436
Normandy?

50:25.648 --> 50:27.810
Oui, yes.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.517
Have you... this painting here?

50:32.446 --> 50:34.438
[woman] No, I haven't.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.899
You see on the surface

50:37.117 --> 50:40.861
Adam and Eve in a disrupted
Eden, is a familiar topic.

50:41.080 --> 50:44.369
But if you Io <i>o</i> k at it,
there is no depth,

50:44.583 --> 50:46.666
no soul, no character.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.914
It is nothing more
than shock art.

50:50.130 --> 50:54.170
Wow, very insightful.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.172
What do you think
of this painting?

50:57.471 --> 50:59.337
This one. Right there.

51:02.518 --> 51:07.730
This... This is...

51:07.940 --> 51:10.648
- I'm...
- What?

51:10.859 --> 51:13.192
I am speechless.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.812
It's brilliant.

51:16.907 --> 51:20.571
[man] Well, you should tell the
artist. He's right behind you.

51:22.705 --> 51:28.576
[woman] Excuse me, this lovely Frenchman
was just admiring the depth of your work.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.878
- Yes, your painting...
- Do I know you from somewhere?

51:33.465 --> 51:36.583
Uh, no, no.
I don't think we've ever met.

51:38.721 --> 51:42.681
It is you.
You are the guy from the party.

51:42.891 --> 51:47.306
- No.
- What are you... what are you putting on some kind of accent?

51:47.521 --> 51:50.104
No, you're mistaken. I am...

51:50.316 --> 51:52.148
My name is Pierre.

51:52.359 --> 51:53.645
Pierre Lumiere.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.148
No, I remember you, drunken ass.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.275
I remember the whole night.

51:58.490 --> 52:02.234
So what? You make fun
of me in your native tongue,

52:02.453 --> 52:05.116
then you thought, hey,
I want to track this guy down,

52:05.331 --> 52:08.665
put on some phony ass French accent
and want to fuck with me again?

52:08.876 --> 52:13.917
Because I remember you droning on and
on and on about your ex-wife, right?

52:14.131 --> 52:16.794
Stacey.
How Stacey broke up with you.

52:17.009 --> 52:19.126
How Stacey won't
return your calls,

52:19.345 --> 52:21.865
and how you're worried that Stacey's
going to find some other cock,

52:21.889 --> 52:25.257
- and she's coming back...
- It's Susan, okay?

52:26.185 --> 52:28.347
- Her name is Susan.
- Susan?

52:28.562 --> 52:32.556
Sarah, Steve, who cares, huh?

52:32.775 --> 52:36.314
Then you mock me for being gay.
What the fuck is that?

52:36.528 --> 52:39.612
- Maybe we should go.
- What? Are you gonna give me shit about my work now too,

52:39.823 --> 52:42.190
- is that it?
- No, no.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.409
- You're right about me.
- Yeah.

52:45.621 --> 52:47.863
I am stuck in my head
about my relationship

52:48.082 --> 52:50.620
and the whole fucking thing and
the other night, I was a mess.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.247
I barely even remember what
happened, but screw all that.

52:53.462 --> 52:55.374
Tonight's about you.

52:55.589 --> 52:57.455
It's about
appreciating your work.

52:58.467 --> 53:00.709
It's impressive.

53:00.928 --> 53:03.841
I really like this, man.

53:04.056 --> 53:08.801
The texture, the weight of it,

53:09.019 --> 53:10.726
the simplicity...

53:11.980 --> 53:14.063
It's moving.

53:15.734 --> 53:17.441
You should be really proud.

53:18.445 --> 53:21.233
You are an incredible artist.

53:21.448 --> 53:23.565
I'm sorry for

53:24.702 --> 53:27.319
bothering you. Come on.

53:36.088 --> 53:37.829
Okay, what do you think?

53:38.048 --> 53:40.335
Does it look like
I'm going to a funeral?

53:40.551 --> 53:44.135
Should I add like a pop of color
or something more casual?

53:45.264 --> 53:48.223
Nick, I need your help, okay?
Is this stunning or stupid?

53:48.434 --> 53:50.471
I still have time
to take it back.

53:50.686 --> 53:55.351
It's black, right? It'll
go along with the whole thing.

53:56.442 --> 54:01.358
Okay. Well, even if that's the case,
could you just indulge me, please?

54:01.572 --> 54:03.734
Is this costume or couture?

54:05.033 --> 54:09.903
- Uh, isn't it bad luck for me to see you in the dress?
- Nick, that's a wedding.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.198
- This whole thing sort of feels like a wedding.
- What?

54:13.375 --> 54:16.539
Babe, you're having a ring ceremony,
a cake, you're trying on a dress.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.356
The next thing I know you're
going to be asking me

54:18.380 --> 54:20.246
to take you on some
post-divorce honeymoon.

54:23.510 --> 54:27.845
Well, you know what? After all of this,
it would be nice to have a little getaway.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.342
[background chattering]

54:40.694 --> 54:43.903
I was kind of surprised when you
said you wanted to meet for a drink.

54:44.948 --> 54:49.568
Yeah, well, it's because I have to
do something that I really hate.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.619
What do you mean?

54:51.830 --> 54:54.038
I got to give
someone else credit.

54:54.249 --> 54:56.491
The other night,
when you walked into my show.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.536
You really helped.

54:59.755 --> 55:02.088
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:03.091 --> 55:07.005
- I thought I ruined everything.
- No, not at all.

55:08.013 --> 55:11.427
You broke me out of my misery.

55:11.642 --> 55:15.511
You know, so here I was bitter
because I wasn't in a relationship.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.602
And then you spot my work,

55:20.567 --> 55:23.981
and it speaks to you.
Truly, speaks to you.

55:24.196 --> 55:29.362
When you shared that passion,
it became infectious.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.533
I meant what I said.

55:31.703 --> 55:33.194
Yeah, well.

55:33.372 --> 55:37.241
Because of that,
I sold my first painting.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.701
- You did?
- Yeah, my first.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.162
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

55:42.381 --> 55:45.499
I don't know, it just
made me think, man.

55:45.717 --> 55:48.630
And who cares,
my ex broke up with me, right?

55:49.972 --> 55:53.636
For the first time
in a long time, I...

55:55.352 --> 55:59.062
felt like something more
than his boyfriend.

55:59.273 --> 56:02.482
[Colin] Sorry. Sorry, we're late.
Jake didn't know his ass from his hand.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.671
Woah, woah, woah. I thought
we told you no crashing.

56:04.695 --> 56:08.154
- What are you doing here?
- No, relax, relax. I invited him.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.401
- Y <i>o</i> u did?
- Yeah.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.152

[soft music]

59:18.055 --> 59:20.513
I have a challenge for you.

59:20.724 --> 59:23.137
A challenge for me? Like
fixing you hasn't been enough.

59:24.102 --> 59:27.436
You have to say yes or no
before hearing the question.

59:27.647 --> 59:30.640
- That seems a little unfair.
- Oh, it's completely unfair.

59:30.859 --> 59:35.069
The odds are totally in
my favor. What's it going to be?

59:35.280 --> 59:38.193
- I'm too tired for this.
- Yes or no?

59:43.205 --> 59:46.323
Yes. Fine, okay.

59:46.541 --> 59:49.955
Now, can you end my misery and tell me
what horrible thing I just agreed to?

59:51.171 --> 59:53.584
A night on the town with me.

59:53.757 --> 59:57.296
We'll consider it a practice
date before I find a real date.

Assuming you can even find someone
willing to hang out with you.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.133
Well, I just did, didn't I?

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.149
Look, I'm ready
for something new.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.022
I mean look at me.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.354
This is Susan's idea

I get it, you're a blank canvas.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:29.953
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.618
I need your help.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.956
Okay, I'll make some calls

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.133
and put you in touch
with the right people, okay?

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.835

for your signature cocktail yet?

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.823
I was thinking
the Tyrannosaurus-ex.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:57.128
- The he-devil.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:00.047

I don't know.

Nope. I love it.

So what is it?

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.998
- Don't take this the wrong way.
- Okay.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:26.329
But I'm just
surprised and shocked

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:31.714
that something so smart,
sophisticated and unique

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.012

but what's going on here?

guys, but me personally,

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.050
like you're
ready to conquer the world.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.845

Are you serious?
I'm just supposed to come here

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.061
Maybe.

What are you guys saying?

We're thinking maybe you don't
belong in this group anymore.

you need to leave.

- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

You mind if
we just talk privately?

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.534
If you have something to say,
you can just say it in front of everyone.

Not to mention
those weird clothes.

Your clothes are weird.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:55.292
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.

I really like the...
You can feel the letters.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:12.142
You know, it's got like the raised letters
like little goosebumps on the paper.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:14.223
Did you still
wanna play the song or...

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:22.773
What is this?

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:40.957

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:49.095
Did I miss something?

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:51.260
Listen, I don't know. I...

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.187
This started
as a business arrangement.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.983
I signed on to plan
your party and that was it.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.481
It didn't even
cross my mind that I would

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.483
actually start to soften or

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.820
actually start to feel like
I was missing who I used to be.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:12.998
But the closer I got to you, the more it
reminded me of what Chuck and I used to be.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.410
And as much as it ended badly,

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.754
that life was
comforting and enticing.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:26.115
Of course, you're still going to have
memories and feelings for who you used to be.

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.846
But that's my problem, Nate.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.094
That life is addictive.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.050
It's all-consuming and I...

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:36.605
If I'm not careful,
I'll end up standing behind

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.899
double pane windows
holding a bun cake

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.773
and commenting on how I really
hope to get to Europe this summer.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.654
I understand.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.737
I understand what you're saying,

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:49.944
but you can't just predetermine

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.780
where two people are going
to end up in a relationship.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.991
I mean, isn't it
about the journey?

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:04.250
And then there will be one
night when you come back home

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:07.132
and you look at me and you
say, "I'm just not happy".

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.841
And then where do we go?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.728
Good luck with the party.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:28.825
[tears up the card]

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.506
Well, I'm not going
to sugarcoat bad news.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.514
Everybody loved your
design for the concert hall,

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:54.970
but you came in second.

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:57.394
Something about it being

01:11:57.605 --> 01:12:01.098
too inventive,
too creative and simply the best

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.604

idea they ever saw.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.855
- Too creative?
- What can I say?

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.737
That's why I do mini-malls.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:23.044
- Hi.
- Whoa! Hey.

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:26.465
What... what are you doing here?

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.716
Oh, I told the guy at
the front desk I was your wife

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.629
and he was so excited.
He showed me the door and everything.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.688
- Have you've been working out?
- You just barge in here while I'm naked?

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.680
I don't get what the big deal is.
I've seen you naked a thousand times.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:42.770
Well, the big deal is that we're kind of
working through some issues at the moment.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:45.897
I don't know if you've got
the right to see my nude body.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:48.697
Ouch.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:54.952
You're right and I have some things
that I'd like to talk to you about.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:58.701
So, can I buy you dinner?

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.168
Why would I
let you buy me dinner?

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.778
[Susan] I could apologize.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.403
I could make excuses.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.154
But the truth is,

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.323
I miss you.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.364
I miss us.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:47.254
We had a language, we had a way of
communicating that belongs to us

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:51.299
and I foolishly tried to
recreate that with Nick.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:54.757
We didn't get each other.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:59.141
I wasn't in sync with
him like I am with you.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:02.312
I miss that.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:08.313
And I'm willing to bet
that you miss it too.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.146
There's a lot I miss.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:16.993
Thank you.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:31.415
So, what do you think?

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:36.545
I don't know. What do you think?

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:41.518
Well...

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.727
I think we were together
for five years.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:56.231
And it would be crazy
not to give it another shot.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:17.465
[Charlie] Excuse me,
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.138
I was told
I could find you here.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.637
[chuckles] I know this is
going to sound really weird

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:28.723
but... I heard you help
people with divorce parties.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.527
Who did you hear that from?

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:37.485
A former member of our group.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.993
Yes, we thought he was
emotionally unstable at the time

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.697
but now, it seems
like a pretty good idea.

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:52.755
I'm sorry,
that was just a one-time thing.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:57.258
Oh, that's too bad.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.336
He said you're a real artist.

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.385
Sorry to bother you.

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:47.393
Hi.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.476
- Shit.
- What?

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.230
I was still trying to figure out what
the hell I was going say to you.

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:58.190
Do you want me
to give you another minute?

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.772
Do you want me to close the
door and come back out again?

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:02.945
No, I'm fine.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.702
[chuckles]

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.197
Moving out?

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:13.703
What? Does the motel down
the street have better rates?

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:20.421
No, I'm getting
back together with Susan.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.088
I'm going home.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.483
That's it? You're not
going to say anything else?

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.359
There's nothing
more to say, Nate.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.914
I got to say, this is one
of the things I really missed.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:02.001
I got to say
I missed doing it for us.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:07.635
So, I was thinking for the party,
maybe I can invite some of my friends.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:13.646
- Would they be new friends or...
- Colin and Jake.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:17.725
You mean the Colin and Jake who
bragged about sleeping with coeds?

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.613
You know, it's probably
not their kind of party.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.861
I'm not sure
they'd even have fun.

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:28.944
Yes, we should
have them over another time.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.906
But you know what?
It's up to you.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.745
Only do it if it's
what you really want.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:47.550
Oh, I am getting my hair done tomorrow
and I made you an appointment.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:52.806
They asked where you'd been and
I told them traveling for work.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.228
[laughter]

01:18:56.357 --> 01:19:00.818
[Jake]
Tell me it is not fucking true.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.006
- [Colin] Of c <i>o</i> urse, it's true.
- [Jake] How can you tell?

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.488
His shoulders are slumped,
his head is sagging and he's

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:07.691
wearing that new cologne
Defeated by Lane Jackoff.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:10.555
- What the hell are you guys talking about?
- Remember that guy's wife

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.866
who's in my fantasy league
who also takes yoga with Jan?

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:16.120
Did I hear that she got invited to a
barbecue you and Susan are throwing?

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.167
Why weren't we
invited to that BBQ?

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.416
- Okay, wait.
- Unbelievable.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:23.151
- You got back together with her?
- So there's no divorce party.

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:27.127
I wanted to take you guys out to lunch
and explain everything properly.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.383
Explain?
What is there to explain?

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:32.341
I'm trying to work things
out with Susan at the moment.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:33.925
It's really complicated.

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:37.637
Look man,
divorce Susan, stay with Susan.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:39.518
Honestly, we don't care.

01:19:39.733 --> 01:19:42.476
It's really
not that complicated.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.533
Guys.

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:56.080
[phone rings]

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.398
Hey, I am so glad you called because I left
some things off the list this morning.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.961
I've decided to make potato salad instead
of coleslaw. So can you please pick up

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:10.512
- a pound of redskin potatoes, a bunch of chives and some mayo.
- Yes, actually, you know what?

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:13.682
That's perfect because I was thinking
of inviting a friend of mine.

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:17.010
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, Chad. I met him through Colin and Jake.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:19.346
You're going to love him.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:22.808
This barbecue isn't really the
environment for guys who chase coeds.

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:27.021
[chuckles] No, trust me. He's the last
person to be chasing co-eds around.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.116
Yes, we could do eight.
Of course.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.536
Is he bringing
a wife or a girlfriend?

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.956
No, actually, he just broke up with
his boyfriend, so we'll just be seven.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.372
You know, seven's like

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:45.755
just an odd number and I don't want
him to feel like a seventh wheel.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.049
Trust me,
he's going to blend right in.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:56.050
I don't want to tell you you can't invite
him, so if it's what you really want to do.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:00.512
I really do. Okay?

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:09.317
Okay. Bye.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:18.822
[Susan] I know what you mean.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:21.158
Nate and I have
been trying to decide

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.711
if we should get pregnant or if we
should take one last trip to Paris.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.793
Nate, how's work stuff going?

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:33.378
You know, honestly, I've
been thinking about leaving.

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:38.092
- Really?
- Yeah, I actually entered this competition

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:43.354
to design the new concert hall and it sort of
got me thinking about striking out on my own.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:47.184
Well, you know how risky
it is to go out on your own.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:50.362
I said to him, let's just
make that a goal for the future

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:53.531
- when we don't have a mortgage to pay every month.
- Not to mention

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.110
the distance, you know. It's like what
happens if you get a job to do a building in

01:21:57.329 --> 01:22:00.948
- s <i>o</i> me other city like Omaha?
- I hope not.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:02.532
I hate Omaha.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:05.915
Well, if you never take a leap,
then things never change.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:18.090
You know there's plenty of room
for an in-ground pool back here?

01:22:18.308 --> 01:22:20.148
[Dan] Yes, I'm always
saying that to these two.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.345
It could increase
the property value 20% easily.

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:26.439

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.369

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.327
Hang on, I don't
think our guests are interested

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:50.789
in playing some unintelligible drinking
game so they can get hammered.

I wanna play.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:07.313
- Maybe it's time for a change of pace.
- [chants]

01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:10.983
So we don't spend the whole night
treading in the same place.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.187
- [chants]
- Exactly.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.902
- It doesn't hurt to try something new.
- [chants]

yourself and what is true.

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.121

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.494

stupid game, fine.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:27.826
Jane, can I have some more wine?

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:49.105
Feels like we're trying to force
something that shouldn't be forced.

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.354
Feels that way, doesn't it?

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:00.992
I think I need to be
on my own for a while.

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:21.095
Take it from me,

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:24.014
it's not gonna
be as bad as you think.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:27.515
- [chuckles]
- Okay?

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:02.803
- Y <i>o</i> u're resigning?
- Yes, I need to.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:08.636
I mean, you believed in me and I thank you
for that, but I always wanted my own firm.

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:12.063
I know it's going to be tight, but I
feel that now's the time to take a shot.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:18.687
Well, funny enough,

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:20.521
you're already
reaping the rewards.

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:25.068
- What do you mean?
- The city called. All that imagination

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:27.783
and creativity that was way
too much for the concert hall

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:32.333
is perfect for the new skate
park they just commissioned.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:38.085
Why don't you make that your very first
official job for your new company?

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.503
Are you serious?

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:50.473
Hey, man. We just
wanted to congratulate you.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:54.601
- Yeah, that design kicked ass.
- Thanks, guys.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:58.309
Well, whenever you're free, I'm ready to
down some Brewskis or tease some tail.
