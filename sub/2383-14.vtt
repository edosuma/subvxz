00:14.014 --> 00:16.414
<i>Kids,</i>
<i>when your best friend loses someone...</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:18.074
My dad's dead?

00:19.419 --> 00:21.080
<i>You drop everything and rush to his side...</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:22.654
<i>only to find yourself...</i>

00:22.756 --> 00:25.020
<i>standing there with no idea</i>
<i>what to do or say.</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:27.025
This is the toughest time
in Marshall's life...

00:27.127 --> 00:29.027
and I feel absolutely useless.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.892
I mean, what can we do to help?

00:30.997 --> 00:32.464
Well, don't look at me. This morning...

00:32.564 --> 00:34.032
Marshall said, "I have to pee."

00:34.134 --> 00:36.068
And I said, "don't worry, baby.
I'll do it for you."

00:36.169 --> 00:39.161
Halfway through the pee, I'm, like,
"This doesn't even make sense."

00:39.272 --> 00:42.105
I've been to a couple funerals,
so I know my role.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.505
I'm vice girl.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.475
Whatever Marshall needs
to get through this day...

00:45.578 --> 00:47.045
I got it right here.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.241
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.817
Cigarettes, alcohol.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.385
Are these firecrackers?

00:53.486 --> 00:54.953
My God, Robin...

00:55.055 --> 00:57.523
you've somehow crammed
Tijuana into a purse.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.359
Be cool, nerds.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.519
Marshall's mom hasn't eaten...

01:04.631 --> 01:07.600
slept or sat down since we got here.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.964
Wait. That could be my role.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.765
I'll take care of Judy.

01:11.871 --> 01:15.034
Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate y...
the fact that you two aren't very close?

01:15.141 --> 01:16.768
Sweet save.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.401
Okay, yes. Judy and I aren't besties...

01:19.512 --> 01:21.742
but today, whatever she needs, I'm there.

01:21.848 --> 01:22.974
I'm on Judy duty.

01:23.983 --> 01:24.745
"Judy duty."

01:24.851 --> 01:25.818
She said "doody."

01:25.919 --> 01:27.887
Really, guys? At a funeral?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.215
Uh, okay.

01:29.322 --> 01:32.086
While not all of us possess
your lofty sense of decorum...

01:32.192 --> 01:33.955
drug dealer from an '80s
after-school special...

01:34.060 --> 01:35.220
we have to laugh today.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.228
- It's healthy.
- Wait a minute.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.595
Today we are gonna make Marshall laugh.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.496
How?

01:41.601 --> 01:42.693
Ted...

01:42.802 --> 01:44.463
what's the one thing
that always cracks him up?

01:44.571 --> 01:46.129
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.434
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts. Exactly!

01:48.541 --> 01:51.772
So, we are gonna get our bro
a four-star nad-rattler.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.778
You search knees, feet, banisters...

01:53.880 --> 01:55.347
fire hydrants and diving boards.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.245
And I'll cover bats,
rackets, hockey sticks...

01:57.350 --> 01:58.681
golf clubs and riding crops.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.480
- What about animals?
- Ah!

02:00.587 --> 02:02.054
Claws, paws, talons.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.884
Hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.457
We can do this!

02:05.558 --> 02:07.025
Hey, guys. Sorry. Um...

02:07.127 --> 02:09.493
I left my charger back in New York,
so my phone's out of juice.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.257
- Does anyone have a...
- Outlet or USB?

02:12.332 --> 02:13.799
Uh, outlet. Thank you.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.200
Oh.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.100
- Hey, you really do have
everything in there, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.969
You're like Mary Poppins if her
magic purse was also filled with drugs.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.235
"lf"?

02:23.343 --> 02:26.039
Ted, the kids in that movie
jumped into a painting...

02:26.146 --> 02:28.580
and spent 15 minutes
chasing a cartoon fox.

02:28.681 --> 02:32.276
"Spoonful of sugar?"
Grow up.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.313
I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.

02:36.422 --> 02:41.121
Thank you, Reverend. We're so happy
that you're going to lead the services today.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.195
Unfortunately, I can't.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.459
My daughter in Chicago
just went into labor.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.126
But I'm leaving you
in the capable hands...

02:49.235 --> 02:51.669
of my second-in-command... my son.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.864
Your son?

02:53.973 --> 02:56.237
Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.378
Guys...

03:00.480 --> 03:02.778
Trey Platt terrorized me growing up.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.180
He was... He was
the toughest bully in school.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.253
What's up, Marshall?

03:08.288 --> 03:10.188
Hello, Trey.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.757
Long time.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.052
I was not aware
that you had become a reverend.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.220
Yeah, well, your lunch money
finally ran out.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.157
Kidding.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.400
Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh!

03:25.171 --> 03:26.968
This video is entitled...

03:27.073 --> 03:28.734
"Little League Coach
Gets Hit in the Nuts...

03:28.841 --> 03:31.002
by a Foul Ball and Then
Vomits in a Garbage Can."

03:31.110 --> 03:33.578
I don't want to give anything away.
Let's just watch.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.340
Oh!

03:38.885 --> 03:41.410
- See, 'cause... 'cause he got hit...
- Right in the nuts.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.284
- And then the fat kid...
- The fat kid just keeps...

03:43.389 --> 03:44.913
- runs away.
- running away.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.389
Trey Platt.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.525
I can't believe
my father's funeral service...

03:49.629 --> 03:53.030
is being led by
Trey "the Noogie Machine" Platt.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.295
That guy gave you noogies?
What, did he carry a stepladder?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.704
He made me carry it.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.473
So my dad asks these questions...

04:01.574 --> 04:05.237
to help create a theme for the service,
or... whatever.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.608
Question one.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.739
"What were your last words
with the deceased?"

04:09.849 --> 04:11.111
Lame.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.719
- Question two.
- Wait.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.384
My last words with Marvin were lovely.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.548
I've been thinking about them a lot.

04:19.659 --> 04:23.925
Me too. We went for a hike in the snow
and had this amazing talk.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.295
My last day with Pop,
he taught my son how to skate.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.901
Well, this is clearly yielding nothing.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.473
Thanks, Dad.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.270
Guess I'll have to fill the time
with some jokes... again!

04:39.012 --> 04:42.243
"Last words" seems like a good theme.

04:42.348 --> 04:45.408
Marshall, do you remember
the last thing your father said to you?

04:47.186 --> 04:49.017
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.581
Son...

04:52.759 --> 04:55.250
there's something
I want to say before I leave.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.027
Yeah, Dad?

04:59.899 --> 05:02.697
Could I snag
that extra pork chop for the flight?

05:03.903 --> 05:05.871
I was gonna make a sandwich
with that, Dad.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.940
- D'ah!
- Don't they have food on the plane?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.942
Yeah, but plane food is ass.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.804
"Plane food is ass."

05:16.749 --> 05:20.048
Those are the last words
my father will ever say to me.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.179
Right after I denied the man a pork chop.
Oh, God.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.362
- Ooh!
- Wait! I'm wrong!

05:30.463 --> 05:34.229
I'm wrong! That wasn't it.
They couldn't find a cab.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.461
Hey! Marshall!
<i>So my dad called up from the street.</i>

05:36.569 --> 05:37.536
Marshall!

05:39.072 --> 05:40.903
Looks like rain out here!

05:41.007 --> 05:44.909
I couldn't find an umbrella
in your closet.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.571
You know who probably has an umbrella?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.081
<i>And then... Well, see,</i>
<i>my dad grew up in a small town...</i>

05:51.184 --> 05:54.745
<i>in another generation,</i>
<i>so sometimes, totally well-meaningly...</i>

05:54.854 --> 05:56.321
<i>he'd say stuff like...</i>

05:56.422 --> 05:59.482
The Koreans across the hall!

05:59.592 --> 06:02.823
Yeah, the Koreans are a trustworthy
and generous people.

06:02.929 --> 06:06.296
- Dad...
- I bet you one of the Koreans has an umbrella.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.833
l... Heck, they're Koreans!

06:11.404 --> 06:14.703
My dad's last words to me
were a string of...

06:14.807 --> 06:16.866
odd racial stereotypes.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.841
All that stuff was really nice.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.072
- Yeah, it's positive racism.
- Mmm.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.013
This is worse than the pork chop.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.218
This next clip is entitled...

06:27.320 --> 06:30.881
"Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts
by Low-flying Seagull."

06:30.990 --> 06:32.685
Let's see what happens.

06:32.792 --> 06:33.952
Let's take a...

06:34.060 --> 06:35.755
Here...

06:35.862 --> 06:37.659
Here it comes, and here...

06:37.764 --> 06:39.527
- Oh!
- Oh!

06:41.634 --> 06:43.761
- 'Cause he gets hit...
- Right in the nuts.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.361
And then... The fat kid just...

06:46.472 --> 06:48.906
- His swim trunks fall off.
- His shorts just fall right off.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.635
No, wait. I'm wrong.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.940
That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab,
so I went down there.

06:54.046 --> 06:59.109
Hey. You were right.
The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.880
- Of course they did.
- Bye, sweetie. Mwah!

07:05.224 --> 07:07.249
Hey, Son, uh...

07:07.360 --> 07:10.557
I just want to leave you
with a little advice.

07:12.632 --> 07:16.500
Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

07:16.602 --> 07:19.230
I caught it on the cable last night.
It totally holds up!

07:21.674 --> 07:25.542
<i>Crocodile Dundee 3</i> is the second-best
of the <i>Croc</i> trilogy, so...

07:25.645 --> 07:27.476
- You know, maybe I can live with that.
- Yeah.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.071
Oh. Sorry. My phone's charged.

07:31.884 --> 07:35.251
I, uh... I hear you're
a woman who can get things.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.289
I have been known to locate
certain objects from time to time.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.292
I need vodka and dirty playing cards.

07:42.728 --> 07:43.695
I got you.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.298
Oh, my God.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.096
What is it?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.995
I have a voice mail from my dad.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.681
- You have a voice mail from your dad?
- How?

08:03.783 --> 08:08.083
My phone's been out of juice, so he must
have called me the day that he, uh...

08:10.823 --> 08:12.984
Baby, are you okay?

08:13.092 --> 08:15.151
I hold in my hand...

08:15.261 --> 08:17.889
the last words
my father will ever say to me.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.397
I'm gonna hit "play."

08:25.004 --> 08:26.665
What's wrong?

08:26.772 --> 08:29.707
What if it's worse
than <i>"Crocodile Dundee 3"?</i>

08:31.077 --> 08:34.376
I can't do this. I c...

08:34.480 --> 08:36.414
My mom is about to collapse.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.950
- I'm gonna take...
- No, no, baby. Baby, I got it. Let me.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.780
You know, you should listen to it.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.823
Just don't put too much pressure on it.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.824
She's right. I mean, this idea that...

08:46.926 --> 08:49.394
someone's last words have to be
profound and meaningful...

08:49.495 --> 08:51.053
I mean, who can live up to that?

08:51.163 --> 08:52.391
Exactly.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.398
All those "famous last words"
people supposedly said...

08:54.500 --> 08:55.899
they're all made-up.

08:56.002 --> 09:00.564
Like that patriotic dude,
Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?

09:00.673 --> 09:02.334
My only regret...

09:02.441 --> 09:05.774
is I have but one life to lose
for my country.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.279
You know what his real last words were?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.873
I'm peeing my pants!

09:12.785 --> 09:14.685
True story.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.950
The point is, last words are overrated.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.786
Look, think of it this way.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.020
You get to hear
your dad's voice one last time.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.121
I should go listen to this... alone.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.460
- Yeah.
- Okay? I'll be right back.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.534
Okay.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.535
Hey.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.539
So, um, I heard you might have...

09:35.641 --> 09:37.268
You heard right.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.071
I'm getting a reputation.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.274
So what you need, mama? Come here.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.619
Guys, listen to what just happened.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.656
Judy, do you need a break?
I'm happy to cook for a while.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.249
You think your snobby New York cooking
is better than mine!

09:55.361 --> 09:57.556
Admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily!

09:57.663 --> 10:03.659
Why don't you just whip up a batch
of your fancy tofu-sushi bagels...

10:03.769 --> 10:05.760
and choke on them!

10:05.871 --> 10:07.600
- Whoa.
- Are you okay?

10:07.707 --> 10:08.605
Listen.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.241
I'm gonna go take a nap.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.407
Judy's finally sleeping,
and it's all because of me.

10:17.516 --> 10:21.077
Guys, I have a role.
I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!

10:21.187 --> 10:25.351
Well... But this day is tough on you too.
You sure you can absorb all that?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.120
Yeah! Robin gave me
a little orange pill from her purse.

10:28.227 --> 10:31.628
I don't know what's in it, but things
are flowing pretty smooth right now.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.096
Hey. Stay hydrated.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.133
Hey.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.532
So?

10:38.771 --> 10:41.797
I couldn't listen to it.
Guys, this is hard.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.933
We know, baby,
but you'll always wonder if you don't.

10:45.044 --> 10:48.605
Your dad loved you.
It almost doesn't matter what he said.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.614
- It doesn't matter.
- Guys... Guys...

10:50.716 --> 10:54.277
What if, God forbid,
all of your dads died right now?

10:55.955 --> 10:58.719
What would their last words
to you have been? Seriously.

10:59.725 --> 11:00.987
I know mine.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.357
When I was in Cleveland last month...

11:03.462 --> 11:05.794
I went to visit my dad at his...

11:05.898 --> 11:08.628
post-divorce bachelor pad.

11:08.734 --> 11:12.295
Been fun bro-in' out
with you tonight, T-Dawg.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.838
Yeah.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.499
I'm so glad we can talk about
our sex lives now.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.601
That's totally an improvement.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.203
I hooked up with a younger woman
the other week.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.748
Donna Bromstead.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.317
My prom date?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.086
How far did you get, T-Dawg?

11:31.090 --> 11:32.853
I have to go.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.821
How would you like those to be
your father's last words?

11:38.931 --> 11:42.367
Well, they might be.
Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.365
Lawyered.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.001
Lily.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.772
Hello?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.780
<i>Lily? It's Dad.</i>

11:56.882 --> 12:00.613
<i>Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying</i>
<i>taxes for the last 25 years...</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:03.211
<i>but... bright side...</i>
<i>I thought of a great new board game...</i>

12:03.322 --> 12:06.052
<i>Tax Evasion. Ages six to 10.</i>

12:06.158 --> 12:08.820
<i>Which is ironically</i>
<i>what I might be looking at.</i>

12:08.928 --> 12:12.022
<i>Anyway, pumpkin, I need $15,000.</i>

12:12.131 --> 12:13.598
Fooled ya!

12:13.699 --> 12:16.793
Leave a message after the beep.
We'll get back to ya.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.393
Beep.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.936
Lawyered.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.805
Robin.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.371
And so, despite the endless
disappointment you've caused me...

12:31.484 --> 12:34.749
I pray that this will
finally be the year...

12:34.854 --> 12:38.017
that you achieve something
of actual significance.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.922
I'd love to stop lying to my friends
about you being in a coma.

12:42.661 --> 12:45.255
Anyway, point is...

12:45.364 --> 12:46.854
happy birthday, R.J.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.433
- Ooh. Wow!
- God.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.560
- That's awful.
- Nope. Here's the awful part.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.833
You remembered my birthday!

12:57.943 --> 13:00.002
Lawyered.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.842
Now, can we all just admit
that last words...

13:02.948 --> 13:04.643
are, in fact, a big deal?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.411
- Yes.
- Yes.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.181
Man. I always thought I had it rough...

13:09.288 --> 13:11.756
not really knowing my dad, but...

13:11.857 --> 13:16.294
now I realize at least I'll never
have to suffer like this.

13:16.395 --> 13:19.728
Our next video is called " German Shepherd
Activates Tennis Ball Cannon...

13:19.832 --> 13:21.823
- While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."
- Okay, Barney...

13:21.934 --> 13:25.267
Please, and, Barney,
no more videos, okay? I'm just...

13:25.371 --> 13:27.168
I just need a minute.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.438
Okay. Okay, who is responsible for this?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.979
Who got Cousin Daphne drunk?

13:35.080 --> 13:37.344
She is 15 years old!

13:37.449 --> 13:39.440
Whoa! They grown 'em big out here.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.611
And here's your phone number back.

13:44.523 --> 13:47.151
- Judy, l...
- l-I did it.

13:47.259 --> 13:51.059
What possible excuse
could you have for this?

13:51.163 --> 13:54.690
I'm from New York.
We think getting minors drunk is funny.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.258
There's nothing funny
about getting minors drunk!

13:58.370 --> 14:00.600
You should be ashamed, Lily!

14:00.706 --> 14:01.832
Ashamed!

14:05.244 --> 14:08.008
Mmm! Oh, boy, it's so tasty.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.580
Mmm! Mmm!

14:09.682 --> 14:13.550
That salad's the first food
she's eaten in two days.

14:13.652 --> 14:16.815
Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise
and jelly beans, but it counts.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.480
Well, at least someone's helping.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.422
We haven't made Marshall laugh once.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.050
Yeah.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.722
Showing videos of guys getting hit
in the nuts wasn't gonna do anything.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.594
- That was just stupid.
- Stupid.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.669
What we need to do is
hit <i>each other</i> in the nuts.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.964
Yes!

14:33.072 --> 14:35.233
Nothing beats the immediacy
of live theater!

14:35.341 --> 14:37.809
But which one of us is gonna take the hit?

14:37.910 --> 14:39.844
- Hey, Marshall.
- Mm.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.435
Ooh!

14:41.547 --> 14:43.811
So that's it? No discussion?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.348
I'm not gonna listen.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.354
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3"...</i>

14:50.456 --> 14:54.916
are the last words
that my father will ever say to me, and...

14:55.027 --> 14:56.995
I think I can live with that.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.562
Is he laughing?

15:00.666 --> 15:03.794
<i>And Marshall</i>
<i>really did think he could live with that.</i>

15:03.936 --> 15:06.700
<i>That is, until later,</i>
<i>at the memorial service.</i>

15:06.805 --> 15:09.865
My last talk with Marvin...

15:09.975 --> 15:12.341
was so lovely.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.039
<i>The stories his mother</i>
<i>and brothers told were so perfect.</i>

15:16.148 --> 15:18.446
Then he picked my crying son
up off the ice...

15:18.550 --> 15:20.245
he gave him a hug and said...

15:20.352 --> 15:23.913
"Champ, it doesn't matter
if you fall down once in a while."

15:24.023 --> 15:25.490
And as we hiked...

15:25.591 --> 15:27.718
a little deer appeared on the path.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.124
She hopped over to Dad
and started eating...

15:30.229 --> 15:32.720
right out of his hand.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.856
And then he kissed me.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.434
And he said...

15:36.535 --> 15:38.765
"I will always be proud of you."

15:38.871 --> 15:41.066
"Life is such a gift."

15:41.173 --> 15:43.869
"You know something, gorgeous?

15:43.976 --> 15:47.104
I'm the luckiest man alive."

15:49.081 --> 15:50.241
Lame.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.907
These stories suck.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.646
It doesn't hold a candle
to your <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> thing.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.346
Mm-mmm.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.048
He reminded me to slow down.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.092
You're up next, baby.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.031
I just need some air.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.131
Baby, are you okay?

16:15.040 --> 16:16.871
I have to listen to it.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.614
It's a pocket dial.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.984
It's nothing.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.873
Okay, so it's a pocket dial.

16:49.975 --> 16:53.138
You know, you have so many
great memories with your dad.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.076
Who cares about the last one?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.977
She's right.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.811
You guys don't get it, okay?

16:58.917 --> 17:00.851
None of you do.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.888
My dad was my hero.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.551
And he was my teacher.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.559
And he was my best friend.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.055
He always came through for me.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.891
And now he's just gone.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.194
And what am I left with?

17:24.643 --> 17:26.667
Thanks a lot, God!

17:26.779 --> 17:27.837
Thank you.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.414
You took my father.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.542
The greatest man that I have ever known.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.678
And you ripped him off this earth
way too young.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.851
And he'll never get to meet
our kids, Lily.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.420
But we got this voice mail.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.526
Thank you so much for the voice mail.
It's a great comfort!

17:50.636 --> 17:53.070
'Cause whenever I'm starting
to feel Ionely...

17:53.172 --> 17:57.108
or sad or... or you know what...
or maybe a little bit cheated...

17:57.209 --> 17:59.871
at least I got the sound
of his pocket to console me.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.469
- Marshall...
- How is this fair?

18:02.581 --> 18:06.142
You know, like, an entire human life...

18:06.251 --> 18:08.947
and it just ends for no reason.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.715
And...

18:10.823 --> 18:12.723
And what are we left with?

18:14.960 --> 18:16.791
<i>Marshall?</i>

18:16.895 --> 18:19.887
<i>Ohl Looks like I've been calling you</i>
<i>for almost five minutes.</i>

18:19.998 --> 18:22.228
<i>How's my pocket sound?</i>

18:22.334 --> 18:25.565
<i>Oh, sorry about that, buddy.</i>

18:25.671 --> 18:30.040
<i>Um, anyway, your mom and I</i>
<i>had such a great time seeing you.</i>

18:30.142 --> 18:32.110
<i>I love you.</i>

18:36.014 --> 18:37.948
Looks like your dad came through
one last time.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.218
"I love you."

18:51.130 --> 18:53.428
My father's last words to me
are "I love you."

18:54.733 --> 18:57.031
<i>Ooh. And let me know</i>
<i>if you find my foot cream.</i>

18:57.136 --> 18:59.263
<i>That fungus thing is acting up again.</i>

19:03.609 --> 19:05.201
"I love you."

19:06.778 --> 19:08.837
My father's last words to me
are "I love you."

19:08.947 --> 19:10.938
- Yes, they were.
- We heard it, yeah.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.778
Loud and clear.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.620
Bye, Pop.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.687
<i>So Marshall finally got up to speak.</i>

19:20.792 --> 19:22.692
<i>Funny thing though...</i>

19:22.794 --> 19:25.627
And then my father said
the last words that he'll ever say to me:

19:27.833 --> 19:30.996
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

19:31.103 --> 19:34.504
I caught it on the cable last night,
and it totally holds up."

19:36.041 --> 19:38.976
<i>He decided to keep</i>
<i>Marvin's real last words just for himself.</i>

19:39.077 --> 19:41.477
Thanks.

19:41.580 --> 19:42.877
For what?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.882
I know what you've been doing today.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.680
And I really needed it.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.277
Anytime.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.384
That dress makes you look
like a Kansas City whore.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.787
Sorry, dear. Last one.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.962
Oh, man.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.505
I should have rented <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

20:10.375 --> 20:12.935
Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?

20:15.948 --> 20:16.915
Thanks.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.009
I'll be right back.

20:24.122 --> 20:28.252
And if I don't come back, well,
then these are my last words to you all.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.730
I really, really, really love you guys.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.759
And I'm gonna go drop a deuce.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.337
Oh, you ruined it!

20:40.439 --> 20:42.930
<i>Last words. It's a lot of pressure, kids.</i>

20:43.041 --> 20:44.736
<i># And what do we know #</i>

20:44.843 --> 20:47.778
- <i>It gets you thinking.</i>
- <i># About what we've learned? #</i>

20:47.879 --> 20:50.575
Hi, Dad.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.049
Hi, Dad.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.352
Hi, Dad.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.082
Hey, Mom.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.390
I'm ready to meet my dad.

21:30.856 --> 21:31.823
