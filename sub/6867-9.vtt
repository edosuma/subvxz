Twelve straight weeks
and Pam's still on Team Live Badass.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.222
Yeah, and Team Live Badass?
That's the best you could come up with?

19:53.425 --> 19:57.384
Well, Lana, since you already had dibs
on Team I Have An Oversized Vagina...

19:57.596 --> 19:58.824
- Hey, shut up.
- You shut up.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.228
And everybody else shut up
and watch Terms of Enrampagement.

First of all, what the shit, Mother?
And second of all, too bad...

20:14.246 --> 20:17.272
...because the doctor says
my cancer is in remission.

20:17.482 --> 20:19.211
Seriously, what is cancer?

20:19.418 --> 20:22.251
So I'll probably never get
any sort of cancer again, ever.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.786
So shut up and watch my movie.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.391
- For which I really need a better title.
- Oh. How about Citizen Dickbag?

20:29.328 --> 20:30.886
Snark Victory?

20:32.965 --> 20:33.954
Wait. I got it.
