00:07.107 --> 00:09.132
Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.540
I'm Val. I'll be your waitress today.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.578
Have you had a chance
to look over the menu?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.012
Might I suggest the meatball sandwich?

00:16.116 --> 00:18.380
It's the owner's personal favorite.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.884
WOMAN: Sounds good.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.952
- Sir?
- Hi.

00:23.056 --> 00:26.753
Two Junior Meals for the kids,
and I'll have the club sandwich.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.294
- Okay.
- Oh, can I get some extra pickles on that?

00:29.396 --> 00:30.954
- No problem.
- Thank you.

00:31.164 --> 00:32.131
VAL: Waters all around?

00:32.232 --> 00:33.256
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.355
Okay.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.197
WOMAN: Okay, once the food comes,
that's it for the games.

00:38.271 --> 00:42.230
All right! Wallets and purses
on the table in front of you, now!

00:42.342 --> 00:43.969
Valuables in here.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.468
Hey! You listening to me?

00:49.682 --> 00:50.979
(GROANING)

01:12.672 --> 01:14.299
What did you do?

01:16.042 --> 01:17.475
I don't know.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.804
(WOMAN CHATTERING)

02:33.987 --> 02:35.318
Thank you.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.988
Your menu.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.752
WAITRESS: And for you, sir.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.789
Fancy.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.624
Well, I know you don't
get off the base much,

02:46.733 --> 02:49.566
except for official business,

02:50.303 --> 02:52.396
so I thought I'd take you somewhere nice.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.563
Well, I don't mind telling you

02:53.673 --> 02:56.141
I've been looking forward
to this little date all week.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.233
I wouldn't exactly call it a date. It's...

02:58.344 --> 03:01.006
Oh, I've watched enough of your television
to know what a date is, Daniel.

03:01.114 --> 03:05.744
It's a romantic event typified
by dinner, movie, and/ or karaoke,

03:05.852 --> 03:09.015
and usually culminating in a night of...

03:09.822 --> 03:11.790
Okay, this is definitely not a date.

03:11.891 --> 03:14.951
It's two friends and co-workers
out for dinner.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.787
- Oh, well, I...
- WAITER: Hi.

03:16.896 --> 03:17.885
Hi.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.830
- Can I start you off with a drink?
- Absolutely.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.026
Well, tonight's feature martinis

03:22.135 --> 03:24.933
are the chocolate, passion fruit,
and shochu plum.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.030
They all sound wonderful.
So one of each, then?

03:28.141 --> 03:29.574
Yeah, I think
we're going to pace ourselves.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.474
She'll do the passion fruit.

03:32.579 --> 03:33.671
(EX CLAIMS)

03:33.780 --> 03:36.010
And I'm going to have the bottled water.

03:36.115 --> 03:37.207
Sure.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.581
Listen...

03:45.258 --> 03:47.249
- Let me start.
- Okay.

03:48.294 --> 03:52.788
Look, I know it hasn't been easy for you,
adjusting to your new life here,

03:52.899 --> 03:56.130
learning to trust other people,
and, most importantly,

03:56.236 --> 04:00.138
refusing the temptation
to fall back on your old ways.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.367
But you have worked hard

04:02.475 --> 04:05.273
to make a place for yourself with us and...

04:05.912 --> 04:08.472
And dinner tonight
is my way of saying thank you.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.315
Thank you for proving me right

04:10.416 --> 04:13.214
when I said we could
take a chance on you.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.782
I don't know what to say.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.925
Just say what you were going to say
before I interrupted.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.527
Okay. I need to use the bathroom.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.801
Yeah. It's...

04:31.471 --> 04:32.563
Okay.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.300
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

04:48.721 --> 04:50.018
(GRUNTING)

04:54.494 --> 04:55.722
(MOANING)

05:00.366 --> 05:02.357
She needs some fresh air.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.539
Your friend has taken ill.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.349
What? Where is she?

05:19.552 --> 05:22.521
She was escorted outside
by another gentleman.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.424
ATHENA: I apologize for that.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.999
The surgery was performed
in a moving car.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.968
They were more concerned about
removing the subcutaneous transmitter

06:11.070 --> 06:13.163
than being gentle about it.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.310
Do I know you?

06:21.414 --> 06:24.144
You did, a long time ago.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.847
Qetesh, the Goa'uld
that once occupied your body,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.354
was a rival of mine.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.321
She was a very intelligent adversary,

06:32.425 --> 06:35.826
which is why I eventually decided
to partner with her.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.024
In retrospect,

06:38.131 --> 06:41.726
it's also the reason I should have
been more careful about trusting her.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.893
VALA: As the host to her Goa'uld,

06:44.003 --> 06:47.700
I was an unwilling participant
in many of Qetesh's thoughtless actions.

06:47.807 --> 06:51.402
So, if this is a revenge thing,

06:51.511 --> 06:54.480
your anger is, well, misplaced.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.980
This isn't a revenge thing.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.418
Oh.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.718
This is a search for answers.

07:06.726 --> 07:10.457
My position in the Trust
has afforded me considerable resources.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.860
(GROANING)

07:12.064 --> 07:15.033
Ever since I heard
that you joined Stargate Command,

07:15.134 --> 07:18.797
I've been watching and waiting
for an opportunity,

07:19.639 --> 07:21.971
which finally presented itself tonight.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.171
What exactly do you want from me?

07:24.277 --> 07:29.943
The code to an Ancient tablet
that I helped Qetesh locate long ago.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.517
A treasure map of sorts.

07:33.152 --> 07:37.612
She was supposed to share it with me,
but instead decided to keep it for herself.

07:37.723 --> 07:41.056
From what I understand,
she was never able to decipher it.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.219
I'd like that opportunity.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.763
To be honest, it doesn't ring a bell, so...

07:45.865 --> 07:50.302
That's because you've suppressed many of
the details from your time as Qetesh.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.995
The full genetic memory of the Goa'uld

07:52.104 --> 07:55.596
would drive
your inferior human mind insane.

07:58.010 --> 08:02.174
Luckily, we have this device
to help us find what we're looking for.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.315
This'll take a while.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.382
I'll leave you to it then.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.223
We've got the local authorities
searching the area

08:18.331 --> 08:20.629
and conducting interviews
with every possible witness.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.564
So far, they've come up empty.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.102
General, there's no question
the Trust is behind her disappearance.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.694
I mean, they're the only ones
with the resources

08:26.806 --> 08:28.637
capable of pulling something like this off.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.266
Agreed. I've already put a call
through to Agent Barrett.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.242
He's got his people working on it.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.836
We'll find her.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.746
KAKALIOS: We're starting to get images
from her suppressed memory.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.790
Dial it down.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.425
(GRUNTING)

08:54.233 --> 08:56.030
How are you feeling?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.560
A little dizzy.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.266
A little tired. And very, very angry.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.875
Oh, that's because the flashbacks
you're experiencing

09:04.977 --> 09:06.638
are dredging up
some long-buried emotions

09:06.746 --> 09:08.714
that may be coloring your conscious mind.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.874
I'm going to kill both of you
in the most painful way possible.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.678
Things will go a lot faster if you just relax.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.522
Whenever you're ready.

09:20.259 --> 09:21.556
(GROANING)

09:26.065 --> 09:28.090
Jackson, rise and shine.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.599
What is it? What's going on?

09:29.702 --> 09:30.964
Barrett, he came through for us.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.368
He just sent over a list of
suspected Trust safe houses.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.963
Hopefully our girl's in one of them.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.515
<i>LANDRY: Team One, what's your status?</i>

09:51.123 --> 09:52.681
Team One is in position.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.185
Team Two?

09:57.863 --> 09:59.660
Team Two in position.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.762
- Team Three?
<i>- LEADER: Team Three is in position.</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:05.802
(SHUDDERING)

10:08.107 --> 10:11.770
- Do you know what I think the problem is?
- That I can't strangle you?

10:12.378 --> 10:13.538
You're fighting the process.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.877
In the end, all you're really doing
is delaying the inevitable.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.747
Why don't we try and keep an open mind?

10:26.826 --> 10:28.521
All five teams are in position.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.184
<i>You have a go.</i>

10:33.566 --> 10:34.999
Who was that?

10:35.868 --> 10:37.096
Turn it down.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.473
Damn.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.243
Maybe they'll have better luck
at the other locations.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.067
- Cover the door.
- Right.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.576
(GROANING)

11:23.683 --> 11:24.843
(GASPS)

11:33.192 --> 11:35.683
It's all right. We're here to help.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.595
CARTER: Four out of the five safe houses
we hit were empty.

12:17.703 --> 12:21.264
Only one, it turned out,
was still in play, and that was SG-15's.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.831
We lost them and three members
of the local team.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.708
One Trust operative survived
the explosion with minor injuries.

12:27.813 --> 12:31.374
He confirmed that the place was rigged
to blow in the event it was stormed.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.976
He also confirmed
that Vala was being held at that location.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.715
So, it's possible they moved her
before the place was raided?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.814
Unlikely. They wouldn't have had the time.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.985
Besides, the guy we caught claims
he saw Vala making a run for it.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.926
Then she could've gotten out on her own.

12:45.030 --> 12:49.160
If that were the case, why has
she not yet attempted to contact us?

13:14.326 --> 13:15.520
JACKSON: So, what did you want with her?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.789
I mean, what exactly was going on
in that warehouse?

13:17.897 --> 13:20.695
Look, I already told you. I can't say.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.629
It's not that I don't want to help you,

13:22.735 --> 13:24.703
but right now,
I'm more concerned for my well-being.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.066
We can protect you.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.662
No, you can't.

13:29.742 --> 13:30.868
Okay.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.038
He's all yours.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.342
Where are you going?

13:41.453 --> 13:44.889
I'll be out in the hall.
Just yell loudly if you need me.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.127
Don't bother.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.164
Your Jaffa interrogation tactics
won't work.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.901
Believe me, I've seen
some pretty horrible things in my life.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.734
You can't break me.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.611
(INAUDIBLE)

14:19.658 --> 14:22.024
A member of this facility
gets kidnapped unchallenged.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.890
It's no wonder
he doesn't think we can protect him.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.361
But we can protect him.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.830
Yeah, by locking him away
for the rest of his life.

14:27.933 --> 14:31.198
What can you say? There's a downside
to working for super villains.

14:32.638 --> 14:33.935
Well, this is probably going to
take a while.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.303
What do you say we grab a bite to eat?

14:38.978 --> 14:40.070
You're done?

14:40.179 --> 14:42.477
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.820
Whenever you're ready, honey.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.576
How you doing?

15:17.683 --> 15:19.514
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

15:19.618 --> 15:20.880
I'm Sal, the owner.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.853
Sal, the owner of Sol's Diner?

15:24.456 --> 15:27.254
Yeah, Sol was the original owner.
I bought the place from him.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.393
Oh.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.825
- So, how was lunch?
- Delicious.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.791
Delicious enough to pay for it?

15:34.900 --> 15:38.131
Yes. If I had the money, I would
certainly have paid for that meal

15:38.237 --> 15:41.434
and given the lovely waitress
a sizeable gratuity.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.004
The service was impeccable.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.874
Look, lady, everybody's got problems.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.949
I got rent on this place,
a mortgage, a wife, three kids,

15:51.050 --> 15:53.951
and a Shih Tzu
with a recurring gastrointestinal condition

15:54.053 --> 15:56.455
that requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

15:56.455 --> 15:56.682
That requires a very specialized diet,
all right?

15:56.789 --> 15:57.881
Okay.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.025
I'm sorry for trying to cheat you.

16:04.496 --> 16:07.431
Okay. All right, look, if I let you leave,

16:07.533 --> 16:09.398
can I trust you to come back
with the money you owe me?

16:09.501 --> 16:10.490
No.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.229
No? What do you mean, no?

16:12.338 --> 16:14.670
What, you're telling me
you can't be trusted?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.138
Truthfully?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.469
I don't know.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.081
I... I don't remember.

16:25.117 --> 16:29.178
I have no idea who I am,
much less what I'm capable of.

16:29.288 --> 16:33.054
All I know for certain is that about
an hour ago, I was lost, hungry,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.889
and drawn to the delightful aroma
of the blue plate special.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.929
Is this a joke?

16:40.032 --> 16:44.059
I have absolutely no memory of my life
prior to wandering in here.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.405
If that's true,
we need to get you to a hospital.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.666
No hospitals!

16:52.778 --> 16:54.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.839
Hey.

16:56.915 --> 17:00.476
- Everything okay here, Sal?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.885
Don't worry about it.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.655
- Let me go.
- Go where?

17:11.063 --> 17:12.325
Please?

17:13.732 --> 17:17.532
- What, you got a home, you got a family?
- I don't know.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.436
I would pay you back. I would.

17:23.409 --> 17:26.310
Just right now,
I just don't have the means.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.707
Maybe I can do something to help you.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.658
Jackson, how's it going?

17:40.759 --> 17:45.025
Well, from what we learned
from the Trust operative

17:45.130 --> 17:48.657
and the information provided to us
from the Jaffa and the Tok'ra,

17:48.767 --> 17:52.168
this is what I've been able
to piece together so far.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.100
Athena, the Greek goddess of war,
a.k.a. Charlotte Mayfield,

17:56.208 --> 17:58.403
a.k.a. The Goa'uld responsible
for kidnapping Vala.

17:58.510 --> 17:59.602
Now, according to what I've learned,

17:59.711 --> 18:01.611
she was a minor player
who rose to mid-tier status

18:01.713 --> 18:04.079
by pursuing alliances
with more powerful rivals:

18:04.183 --> 18:06.811
Cronos, Camulus, Svarog, and even Anubis

18:06.919 --> 18:08.784
when he was first on the outs
with the System Lords.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.287
So, her partnering up with Ba'al
is just her latest power play?

18:11.390 --> 18:12.379
No, it's more than that.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.823
You see, we know Athena was once allied

18:14.927 --> 18:17.395
with Qetesh,
the Goa'uld that formerly inhabited Vala.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.794
See, apparently,
Qetesh double-crossed her

18:19.898 --> 18:24.062
when they partnered up to search
for the Clava Thessara Infinitas,

18:24.169 --> 18:26.330
the key to infinite treasure.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.770
Now, according to legend,
it will allow he who possesses it entry

18:28.874 --> 18:32.742
to a vast storehouse of riches hidden away
by the Ancients prior to their ascension.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.812
Wow, that's big.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.880
Yeah, and by all indications,
nothing but an elaborate hoax.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.539
- So, they didn't find it?
- No, but for some reason,

18:37.649 --> 18:39.913
Qetesh wanted Athena to think she had.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.452
Athena believed her,
which is why she went after Vala.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.853
And she used Ba'al's resources
here on Earth to get her.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.621
Which reminds me, I'm supposed
to check in with Major Harper.

18:49.728 --> 18:54.256
He's got people querying hospitals
in the area where Vala disappeared.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.665
It's possible she may have been injured
and has been unable to contact us.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.966
Hey, listen,
I spoke with the medical examiner's office.

19:01.073 --> 19:05.407
They're doing DNA testing
on the remains recovered at the blast site,

19:07.446 --> 19:09.641
but it's going to take a while.

19:14.086 --> 19:18.147
You know, when Vala first disappeared
when the Ori gate was destroyed,

19:18.257 --> 19:20.384
I refused to write her off.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.550
Although the odds were against it,

19:21.660 --> 19:25.289
I believed somehow
she'd found a way to survive,

19:26.732 --> 19:28.927
and it turned out I was right.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.304
I want to be right again.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.766
Sure.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.773
- I just figured you should know.
- Yeah. Thank you.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.015
Major Harper, please.

19:48.153 --> 19:52.112
I don't care what the so-called experts
have to say.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.623
I want you to free up the capital

19:53.725 --> 19:57.491
and move it into a company
called Beringer Consolidated.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.620
I have it on good authority

19:58.730 --> 20:02.393
that they'll be announcing
a major breakthrough before week's end.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.866
All right.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.832
The DNA results are in.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.966
They were able to ID 12 victims,
none of them our girl.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.738
My guess is there wasn't enough
of her left to run tests on.

20:13.845 --> 20:16.837
Or there wasn't anything left
because she didn't die in that explosion.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.474
If she got out, she would've gone
straight back to Stargate Command.

20:19.585 --> 20:20.984
They wouldn't still be looking for her.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.816
I don't know, maybe you're right.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.118
Maybe she is dead.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.594
But until we have confirmation,
I want you to keep looking for her, too.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.566

Very nice.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.451
Val, you okay?

21:04.396 --> 21:05.454
Hey.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.454
You all right?

21:08.166 --> 21:10.532
Is it that visions thing again?

21:10.936 --> 21:13.461
Look, I told you, you should
go get yourself checked out, honey.

21:13.572 --> 21:14.630
No.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.006
Sal, what am I doing,

21:18.644 --> 21:20.839
working here, sleeping out the back,

21:20.946 --> 21:24.313
watching reruns of <i>The X-Files</i>
in my spare time?

21:24.416 --> 21:27.579
I appreciate everything
you've done for me,

21:27.686 --> 21:31.281
but I've got to tell you,
I've been thinking about leaving.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.447
So, where are you going to go?

21:33.558 --> 21:38.621
I don't know, but this isn't my life.
It just doesn't feel right.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.694
Trust me, sweetheart,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.462
running away isn't
going to make things better for you.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.730
Working tables here may not feel right,

21:46.838 --> 21:48.806
but at least you've got a roof
over your head

21:48.907 --> 21:51.740
and some friends who care about you.

21:53.178 --> 21:56.113
It may not feel like your life right now.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.444
Just give it some time, okay?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.514
- Okay.
- Good.

22:02.287 --> 22:05.347
Now, get back to work
before I fire your butt.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.056
Hello, and welcome to Sol's Diner.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.291
I'm Val. I'll be your waitress today.

to look over the menu?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.448
What did you do?

22:41.326 --> 22:42.759
I don't know.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.466
Okay. Name?

22:48.567 --> 22:51.161
You know my name.
You're a regular at the deli.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.237
So, what, is "Val" short for "Valerie"?

22:53.338 --> 22:54.464
Okay.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.633
Yes. Valerie.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.176
Last name?

23:06.518 --> 23:07.678
Todad.

23:10.589 --> 23:14.548
Valerie Todad.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.027
Look, Val, is there any reason

23:24.136 --> 23:26.696
why you don't want me
to know your real last name?

23:26.805 --> 23:27.863
No, of course not.

23:27.973 --> 23:31.409
I'm just a very private person.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.473
Would you mind
if I took a moment to freshen up?

23:41.486 --> 23:43.511
Sure. I need a coffee anyway.

23:45.524 --> 23:48.288
Straight ahead, second door on your left.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.739
Oh, sorry.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.399
Oh. Hello.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.728
I didn't know how long
we were going to be,

24:30.836 --> 24:33.771
so I was just going out
to get us some lunch.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.647
Run it through the channels,
see if anything comes up.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.611
I don't understand.

24:46.718 --> 24:49.448
I didn't do anything illegal.
I didn't hurt anyone.

24:49.554 --> 24:51.852
Well, apart from those two fellows who,
from what I understand,

24:51.957 --> 24:53.652
I was totally within my rights to hurt.

24:53.758 --> 24:57.194
Witnesses say you took them both down
without even breaking a sweat.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.626
How did you manage that?

24:58.730 --> 25:00.857
- Instinct.
- No. I think training.

25:00.966 --> 25:04.925
Don't suppose you want to tell me
where you learned those moves?

25:06.972 --> 25:08.633
That's what I thought.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.106
- Sir.
- What is it, Chief?

25:17.382 --> 25:19.646
I thought you should see this.

by a major accounting scandal that will...

25:40.171 --> 25:43.038
Nathan, I'm going to have to call you back.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.844
- What is it?
- We got a call.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.448
Apparently, some people,
they're looking for you.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.987
- Who?
- The United States Air Force.

25:58.023 --> 26:00.924
They're sending a Colonel Carter
to pick you up.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.050
No.

26:02.427 --> 26:04.827
- What do you mean, no?
- I'd rather stay here.

26:04.930 --> 26:08.263
If you need me to commit a crime,
I'd be happy to oblige.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.459
Look, Val, I don't pretend to know
what you're all about,

26:10.569 --> 26:14.130
but when people start throwing
around words like "national security,"

26:14.239 --> 26:16.503
there's not a lot I can do.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.099
All right, I'll be honest with you.

26:19.544 --> 26:22.638
The reason why I can't tell you who I am,

26:22.747 --> 26:24.647
is because I don't know.

26:24.749 --> 26:25.773
I don't remember.

26:25.884 --> 26:29.547
I don't know where I'm from.
I'm not even sure if Val is my real name.

26:29.654 --> 26:33.351
My memory only goes as far back
as that day, two weeks ago,

26:33.458 --> 26:36.894
when I wandered into the deli for a lunch
I couldn't pay for.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.088
I don't remember any of
my life before that,

26:39.197 --> 26:41.165
although I do have flashbacks.

26:41.266 --> 26:45.259
Occasionally, they're terrifying,
like something out of a horror movie,

26:45.370 --> 26:46.394
but they don't make much sense.

26:46.504 --> 26:49.132
I was hoping that, sooner or later,
my memories would just come back,

26:49.240 --> 26:52.368
or that something would help remind me
of who I really am,

26:52.477 --> 26:56.641
but after what happened today,
I'm not sure I want to know anymore.

27:01.319 --> 27:05.688
You know, Val, it would be a lot easier
if you'd just be honest with me.

27:10.095 --> 27:13.587
I'm Colonel Carter.
I'm here to take custody of the prisoner.

27:13.698 --> 27:14.665
Prisoner?

27:14.766 --> 27:16.324

what this is all about?

maybe you should think about...

Won't be long.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.650
...trusting me?

33:52.196 --> 33:56.565
Or un-cuffing me?
Or giving me my pants back?

33:57.235 --> 34:00.261
Okay, just wait right here.
I'll be right back.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.203
Well, he's of no help.

34:05.309 --> 34:08.142
All he remembers was the gun,
then he was off to the races.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.714
Presumably, you are searching
for the missing vehicle.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.874
We've got all available units looking.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.680
In the meantime, it turns out the deceased
in that overturned sedan

34:15.787 --> 34:17.948
were all carrying phony ID.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.286
The license plate was also bogus.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.382
As for the car itself,

34:22.493 --> 34:26.987
it was a company vehicle registered
to a Forsythe Chemicals.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.161
But that's a dead end because, apparently,

34:29.267 --> 34:30.894
they reported the car
missing this morning.

34:31.002 --> 34:32.697
Of course they did.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.668
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

34:36.074 --> 34:37.336
Carter.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.070
All right. Thank you.

34:40.178 --> 34:43.614
We've got a lock on Cam's transmitter.
Thank you, Detective.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.183
Yeah. Sure. Any time.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.951
Okay, I think I've figured out
what happened to you,

34:55.059 --> 34:56.253
why you don't remember anything.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.124
Oh, good.
Does it involve an alien abduction?

34:59.230 --> 35:03.098
Well, in as much as that you're an alien
who was abducted, yes.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.364
You were undergoing a procedure

35:05.470 --> 35:08.303
which was designed to dig up
some of your suppressed memories.

35:08.406 --> 35:09.998
The scientist that we captured told us

35:10.108 --> 35:13.168
that during the procedure,
the device was destroyed,

35:13.277 --> 35:15.108
which allowed you
the opportunity to escape.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.840
From the aliens.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.711
No, they weren't aliens.

35:18.816 --> 35:22.047
They're working for an alien,
but that's not really important.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.587
Vala isn't a particularly alien name.

35:24.689 --> 35:28.216
So, I'm thinking that this device
was in the middle of digging up

35:28.326 --> 35:32.626
these suppressed memories
when it overloads and fries your brain.

35:32.730 --> 35:36.097
So, instead of helping you remember,
it actually made you forget.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.189
Everything.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.929
Disodium guanylate.

35:40.037 --> 35:43.473
That would make a great alien name,
don't you think?

35:43.574 --> 35:45.838
I can understand
why you might be having difficulty

35:45.943 --> 35:47.672
believing what I'm telling you,

35:47.778 --> 35:49.541
but there is one thing you cannot deny.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.912
There are some very, very bad people
after you.

35:53.518 --> 35:56.009
And how do I know
you're not one of them?

35:56.120 --> 35:57.917
Because I saved you from them!

35:58.022 --> 35:59.956
What if they were trying
to save me from you?

36:00.057 --> 36:01.456
How am I supposed to know?

36:01.559 --> 36:03.117
Let me take you back
to Stargate Command.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.455
We have a device that
can help you remember.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.224
I thought you said
the device was destroyed.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.390
It's a different device.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.230
It's one I brought back
from another planet last year.

36:12.603 --> 36:15.766
Oh, good. Were they having a sale?

36:21.979 --> 36:23.378
Understood.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.550
We intercepted a communication
from Stargate Command.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.018
They found him. Turn around.

36:46.771 --> 36:49.001
This isn't what it looks like.

(MAN CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO)

37:26.611 --> 37:28.670
- What?
- Nothing.

37:28.779 --> 37:31.373
I just think it's funny
how you're always losing your pants.

37:31.482 --> 37:34.280
I'm not "always losing my pants."

37:35.853 --> 37:36.787
It's happened twice.

37:36.787 --> 37:37.617
It's happened twice.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.020
Twice is not always.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.216
DANIEL: Okay, thank you.

37:41.325 --> 37:43.452
We've got something on Vala.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.138
DANIEL: Vala?

38:08.586 --> 38:10.486
Vala, it's me, Daniel.

38:12.757 --> 38:16.659
We know you're in here.
There's nowhere else you could've gone.

38:20.865 --> 38:21.923
Vala?

38:27.872 --> 38:28.964
DANIEL: Vala?

38:30.408 --> 38:33.809
I know you're scared,
but we're not here to hurt you.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.080
We can help you remember.

Get out of my way or I will shoot you.

39:53.324 --> 39:56.293
You don't remember who you are, but I do.

39:56.627 --> 39:58.219
You won't shoot.

40:19.517 --> 40:23.476
If I let you go, I know
you're going to make yourself disappear.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.414
You've been running so long,
it's almost second nature to you.

40:29.660 --> 40:34.120
You don't remember it,
but you made a decision to stop running.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.097
It's over.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.829
Now it's time to come home.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.654
You know, I don't mind getting shot,

41:31.755 --> 41:35.122
but I pulled a hammy
when I took out that last Trust operative.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.694
At least you didn't lose your pants.

41:39.563 --> 41:40.723
You wanted to see me?

41:40.831 --> 41:44.597
- Hey, what did Dr. Lam say?
- I've been cleared for active duty.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.768
What's this?

41:47.872 --> 41:50.739
Let's just call it a welcome-back present.

- These are...
- Team badges.

You're now officially a member of SG-1.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.483
Congratulations. You earned it.

42:14.131 --> 42:16.599
Perhaps a celebration is in order.

That's a great idea.

42:18.702 --> 42:22.832
We can check out that new rib joint
near my place.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.100
Excellent.

42:24.208 --> 42:28.872
Of course, that means we'll have to wait
until next week to complete our date.

42:29.146 --> 42:30.773
It wasn't a date.

42:31.482 --> 42:34.110
(STUTTERING) It was two friends
and co-workers out for dinner.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.585

42:44.361 --> 42:45.953
It wasn't a date.
