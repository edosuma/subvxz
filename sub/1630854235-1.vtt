00:39.122 --> 00:43.543
<i>No need to be scared, son,
this is gonna work.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:46.337
<i>Now turn around.</i>

00:47.881 --> 00:51.426
<i>You're about to miss
your first sunrise in years.</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:31.091
<i>Dad!</i>

01:31.132 --> 01:32.801
Peter!

01:46.481 --> 01:50.068
<i>quiet, tense music</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:34.988
<i>Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you,</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:37.657
<i>but could I interest you
in a box of cookies?</i>

02:39.367 --> 02:41.828
<i>Which kind is your favorite?</i>

02:41.870 --> 02:43.121
<i>S'mores.</i>

02:43.163 --> 02:45.874
<i>Then, if it's okay
with your mom,</i>

02:45.915 --> 02:48.626
<i>I'll get a box of those, and...</i>

02:48.668 --> 02:50.378
<i>you keep it for yourself.</i>

02:50.420 --> 02:52.172
<i>That's very kind.
Thank you.</i>

02:52.213 --> 02:53.464
<i>Still four dollars?</i>

02:53.506 --> 02:55.258
<i>Five, now.
How old's your daughter?</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:59.220
<i>You knew the old price,
so I just--</i>

02:59.262 --> 03:00.180
<i>Here you go.</i>

03:00.221 --> 03:02.015
<i>What do we say?</i>

03:02.056 --> 03:03.349
<i>Thank you for your support.</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:36.132
<i>quiet, tense music</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:00.823
<i>Hustle up,
we're gonna be late.</i>

04:00.865 --> 04:02.533
<i>Police have seemingly
no explanation</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:04.452
<i>for the surge in homicides.</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:08.206
<i>Nowhere is that more apparent
than here in midtown Manhattan,</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:10.291
<i>where Times Square
and Penn Station</i>

04:10.333 --> 04:11.709
<i>are eerily empty</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:14.754
<i>after a wave of brutal slayings.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:19.467
<i>Pretty cool, right?</i>

04:19.509 --> 04:21.928
<i>And check it out.</i>

04:21.970 --> 04:23.763
<i>Secret pockets.</i>

04:23.805 --> 04:26.057
<i>Can you go put on
something normal?</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:27.433
<i>But I want to wear this.</i>

04:27.475 --> 04:29.018
<i>We have talked about
in this house,</i>

04:29.060 --> 04:30.019
<i>you can wear
whatever you want.</i>

04:30.061 --> 04:31.437
<i>But out in the world--</i>

04:31.479 --> 04:32.939
<i>But why is it my fault
if people act--</i>

04:32.981 --> 04:35.441
<i>Just don't make yourself
such an easy target.</i>

04:36.776 --> 04:38.695
<i>I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean--</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:41.739
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:44.284
<i>I'll just go change.</i>

04:52.917 --> 04:55.295
<i>Oh, you need some help?</i>

04:55.336 --> 04:58.339
<i>I'm good, thanks.
This is me right here.</i>

04:58.381 --> 05:01.301
<i>Oh, so somebody's finally
moving in next door.</i>

05:02.844 --> 05:05.680
Okay, I'm ready.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.976
<i>This is my son, Isaiah.</i>

05:10.018 --> 05:12.145
<i>I am Naomi.</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:13.896
<i>Isaiah, this is
our new neighbor.</i>

05:13.938 --> 05:14.939
<i>Mark.</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:17.442
<i>Nice to meet you,
Mr. Mark.</i>

05:17.483 --> 05:19.944
He seemed pretty nice, huh?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.907
<i>Okay, what's wrong with him?</i>

05:24.949 --> 05:26.617
<i>Nothing.</i>

05:28.536 --> 05:30.455
<i>Don't be pissed.</i>

05:30.496 --> 05:31.497
<i>Dad!</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:33.624
<i>Hey! [laughs]</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:37.670
<i>Oh, man. Look at you.</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:40.298
<i>You got so big, and where did
all of this come from, huh?</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:42.342
<i>Hey.</i>

05:42.383 --> 05:44.344
<i>Hey, now,
the last time I saw you,</i>

05:44.385 --> 05:46.512
<i>you were working on
a coin trick.</i>

05:46.554 --> 05:48.181
<i>Think you can do it with this?</i>

05:48.222 --> 05:50.183
<i>Sure.</i>

05:50.224 --> 05:51.517
<i>Why does it say,
"Three Months"?</i>

05:51.559 --> 05:53.519
<i>Well, it's, uh,
kind of an award.</i>

05:53.561 --> 05:55.438
<i>- An award?
- You watching?</i>

05:55.480 --> 05:57.065
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:02.737
<i>Oh, come on now. [laughs]</i>

06:02.779 --> 06:04.739
<i>- What?
- Isaiah, give your dad</i>

06:04.781 --> 06:07.033
<i>his "award" back
and wait for me in the car.</i>

06:07.075 --> 06:09.410
<i>You're getting real good, son.</i>

06:09.452 --> 06:10.870
<i>Before you say anything--</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:13.039
<i>You can't keep doing this.</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:15.541
<i>You cannot keep
popping in and out of his life.</i>

06:15.583 --> 06:16.959
<i>I know, I know.
That is why I stayed away</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:18.961
<i>until I got some real sobriety.</i>

06:19.003 --> 06:20.338
<i>I've been going
to meetings every day.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:21.672
<i>I can't have
this conversation again.</i>

06:21.714 --> 06:23.341
<i>I have a job,
I have an apartment.</i>

06:23.383 --> 06:24.384
<i>- It's too late for this.
- I-I can be a real father now.</i>

06:24.425 --> 06:25.718
<i>Look, maybe I can come over</i>

06:25.760 --> 06:27.136
<i>for dinner tonight and prove it.</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:28.888
<i>You think
I'm gonna cook for your ass?</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:31.891
<i>Well, if it's between
your cooking and take-out,</i>

06:31.933 --> 06:33.476
<i>I'm happy
to pick something up.</i>

06:33.518 --> 06:36.562
<i>You wouldn't be doing it for me.</i>

06:37.855 --> 06:40.191
slow, suspenseful music

06:42.235 --> 06:46.489
<i>Isaiah? Put your little butt
in the back seat, please.</i>

07:24.110 --> 07:26.070
<i>fast, pulsating music</i>

08:00.313 --> 08:02.773
<i>Better?</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:12.033
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah.</i>

08:12.074 --> 08:14.785
<i>It's barely a scratch.</i>

08:17.121 --> 08:18.789
I'm fine.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.170
<i>What do you think
of the new place?</i>

08:32.845 --> 08:34.805
<i>You got the big screen?</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:36.349
<i>Oh, yes. [chuckles]</i>

08:36.390 --> 08:38.100
<i>You said it was too expensive.</i>

08:38.142 --> 08:40.686
<i>And you said
it was awesome, so...</i>

08:45.107 --> 08:47.902
<i>What's wrong? Ellie?</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:50.363
<i>Can't take any of it with us.</i>

08:50.404 --> 08:51.531
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

08:51.572 --> 08:52.865
<i>If we have to pack up and run.</i>

08:54.325 --> 08:56.536
<i>Come here.</i>

08:58.246 --> 09:00.456
<i>I'm gonna show you something.
Come here.</i>

09:05.336 --> 09:07.547
<i>Wow. A bathroom.</i>

09:07.588 --> 09:10.299
<i>Eh, correction.
A spare bathroom.</i>

09:12.635 --> 09:14.720
<i>You notice anything about it?</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:21.143
<i>No windows.</i>

09:21.185 --> 09:23.020
<i>There's no windows.</i>

09:25.022 --> 09:26.899
<i>I get my own room?</i>

09:26.941 --> 09:29.193
<i>We're home now, Ellie.</i>

09:29.235 --> 09:32.488
<i>And we're not going anywhere
for a long time,</i>

09:32.530 --> 09:37.326
<i>which means we have to be
even more careful than normal.</i>

09:37.368 --> 09:38.995
<i>I'm careful.</i>

09:39.036 --> 09:41.205
<i>Yeah, well, you're not
always great at blending in.</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:44.041
<i>- Yes, I am.
- Mm, you've got a little...</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:48.796
<i>I also have to blend in, okay?</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:51.924
<i>Which means I have
to find a legitimate job.</i>

09:54.677 --> 09:58.222
<i>And when I get back, I will
tackle those boxes, okay?</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:00.099
<i>I could do it.</i>

10:00.141 --> 10:01.934
<i>Yeah, right. [scoffs]</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:04.854
<i>This IKEA stuff,
it's just like....</i>

10:04.895 --> 10:08.357
<i>a puzzle made by a...
by a sadist.</i>

10:08.399 --> 10:11.444
<i>I like puzzles.</i>

10:11.485 --> 10:13.404
<i>All right. [clears throat]</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:16.949
<i>Text me
if you need anything, okay?</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:23.289
<i>How old was the boy...</i>

10:23.331 --> 10:25.458
<i>who lives next door?</i>

10:25.499 --> 10:30.129
<i>I don't know. Uh, 11, 12.</i>

10:30.171 --> 10:33.633
<i>Listen, I was thinking,
when I get back later tonight,</i>

10:33.674 --> 10:35.509
<i>maybe we can go down
to Times Square.</i>

10:35.551 --> 10:36.636
<i>Ew. Why?</i>

10:36.677 --> 10:38.679
<i>There's this new
science exhibit.</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:40.389
<i>They have photos
from the Hubble.</i>

10:41.849 --> 10:43.476
<i>But if you don't want to go,
that's fine.</i>

10:43.517 --> 10:45.811
<i>I didn't say that.
Is it even open?</i>

10:45.853 --> 10:47.480
<i>What you mean? At night?</i>

10:47.521 --> 10:48.939
<i>I mean,
with all the murders going on.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:52.610
<i>What? That's why
we get to be here, right?</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:55.154
<i>sharp, jarring music</i>

10:58.074 --> 10:59.492
<i>What do we got?</i>

11:01.077 --> 11:02.995
<i>You ever seen
anything like this?</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:06.499
<i>Yeah. Hunting with my dad.</i>

11:06.540 --> 11:09.251
<i>Came across a guy got mauled
to death by a bear.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:11.671
<i>That's a heartwarming
childhood memory.</i>

11:11.712 --> 11:14.173
<i>Hmm. One of the better ones, actually.</i>

11:14.215 --> 11:16.509
<i>- Did you ID the victim?
- Not yet.</i>

11:16.550 --> 11:18.761
<i>There was nothing in his pockets
but some loose cash.</i>

11:18.803 --> 11:20.763
<i>They didn't take the money?</i>

11:20.805 --> 11:22.139
<i>No.</i>

11:22.181 --> 11:24.475
<i>suspenseful music</i>

11:26.060 --> 11:28.854
<i>Any witnesses?</i>

11:28.896 --> 11:32.024
<i>Most of the people here last
night are out panhandling now.</i>

11:32.066 --> 11:34.985
<i>People I did talk to, I believe
the general consensus was--</i>

11:35.027 --> 11:36.654
"Go fuck yourself, Detective"?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.365
<i>I would've
appreciated "Detective." Oh.</i>

12:09.770 --> 12:11.355
<i>What do you want?</i>

12:11.397 --> 12:15.359
<i>Not to be hung up on,
for starters.</i>

12:15.401 --> 12:17.153
<i>That's a bit petulant,
don't you think?</i>

12:17.194 --> 12:20.156
<i>I'm busy, Dad.
What do you want?</i>

12:22.908 --> 12:24.869
<i>I want you to come home.</i>

12:24.910 --> 12:27.163
It's important.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.415
<i>Yeah, sure, I'll just... I'll
just drop everything I'm doing</i>

12:29.457 --> 12:31.625
<i>and hop on the first plane.</i>

12:34.628 --> 12:36.797
<i>I'm dying, Claire.</i>

12:39.133 --> 12:41.260
<i>Pancreatic cancer.</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:44.472
<i>Doctors say
I could go any time now.</i>

12:47.099 --> 12:49.101
<i>There's something
I need to tell you first.</i>

12:49.143 --> 12:51.103
<i>slow, eerie music</i>

12:53.355 --> 12:54.982
<i>It's too late to make amends.</i>

12:58.611 --> 13:00.738
<i>It's about Peter.</i>

13:04.158 --> 13:06.952
<i>What about Peter?</i>

13:06.994 --> 13:09.955
<i>You won't believe me
unless you see for yourself.</i>

13:28.516 --> 13:30.601
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
We don't open for about an hour.</i>

13:30.643 --> 13:33.312
<i>Oh. No. Yes. Uh...</i>

13:33.354 --> 13:37.900
<i>I-I was just wondering
if, uh, Zeke is in?</i>

13:37.942 --> 13:40.486
<i>Yeah. Just a moment, please.</i>

13:54.208 --> 13:56.335
<i>Hi. Can I help you?</i>

14:03.384 --> 14:05.511
<i>Hey, brother.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:13.811
<i>Cynthia...</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:16.021
<i>Can you give us a sec?</i>

14:20.401 --> 14:22.695
<i>The place looks incredible.</i>

14:22.736 --> 14:25.030
<i>Is Eleanor... Is she still...</i>

14:25.072 --> 14:27.199
<i>She's still the same. Yes.</i>

14:27.241 --> 14:29.702
<i>Look, I'm sorry to show up</i>

14:29.743 --> 14:32.496
<i>out of the blue like this.</i>

14:32.538 --> 14:35.958
<i>The thing is, Ellie and I are
back in town, and, uh--</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:38.544
<i>- And do you need money?
- No. I need a job.</i>

14:38.586 --> 14:40.129
I'll do anything.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.547
<i>I'll-I'll-I'll wash dishes,</i>

14:41.589 --> 14:43.048
<i>take out the garbage, anything.</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:44.466
<i>You're serious.</i>

14:44.508 --> 14:45.718
<i>I need your help.</i>

14:45.759 --> 14:47.803
<i>And why would I ever help you?</i>

14:49.346 --> 14:51.557
<i>It's...</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.642
<i>what Liz would want.</i>

15:06.947 --> 15:08.991
<i>You coming?</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:17.541
<i>This is our head chef,
Danielle Wilson.</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.627
<i>Danielle, this is--</i>

15:19.668 --> 15:20.794
<i>- Mark.
- Uh...</i>

15:20.836 --> 15:22.922
<i>Uh, Mark here</i>

15:22.963 --> 15:24.506
<i>is gonna be staging
for you today.</i>

15:24.548 --> 15:26.550
<i>I have a lunch rush coming in.</i>

15:26.592 --> 15:28.260
<i>I don't have time
to babysit your friend.</i>

15:28.302 --> 15:29.762
<i>This used to be his kitchen.</i>

15:29.803 --> 15:31.764
<i>That-that was a long time ago.</i>

15:31.805 --> 15:33.599
<i>Just give him one shift
to prove himself.</i>

15:33.641 --> 15:35.851
<i>If he washes out, he's gone.</i>

15:35.893 --> 15:37.937
<i>Good luck.</i>

15:39.563 --> 15:41.106
<i>How's your knife skills?</i>

15:41.148 --> 15:43.776
<i>- Sorry?
- Are you good with a knife?</i>

15:43.817 --> 15:45.444
<i>Yes.</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:47.112
<i>Brunoise a quart of shallots.</i>

15:47.154 --> 15:49.615
<i>If you don't fuck it up,
we'll keep talking.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:58.082
<i>I know
you don't want to talk to me,</i>

15:58.123 --> 16:01.126
<i>so I will just sit here
for a bit.</i>

16:03.128 --> 16:05.130
<i>And when I get back up,</i>

16:05.172 --> 16:07.216
<i>maybe I'll remember
to take this with me.</i>

16:07.257 --> 16:09.677
<i>Maybe I won't.</i>

16:13.931 --> 16:16.100
<i>Last night,
I-I was trying to sleep,</i>

16:16.141 --> 16:17.726
<i>and I heard someone screaming.</i>

16:17.768 --> 16:19.812
<i>I look out, there's a guy
coming down the street,</i>

16:19.853 --> 16:21.230
<i>and he's covered in blood.</i>

16:21.271 --> 16:23.607
<i>What's the guy look like?</i>

16:23.649 --> 16:26.110
<i>White, twenties,</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:28.112
<i>sweatshirt and jeans.</i>

16:28.153 --> 16:29.780
<i>Big guy?</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:32.157
<i>Not much bigger than you.</i>

16:33.867 --> 16:36.829
<i>But... his eyes...</i>

16:37.997 --> 16:40.791
<i>What about his eyes?</i>

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
<i>You ever, um...</i>

16:43.460 --> 16:45.796
<i>...you ever, like, take a photo
at night, instead of eyes,</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:47.339
<i>you get
these little rings of light?</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:50.134
<i>So a little guy
with the strength of a bear</i>

16:50.175 --> 16:51.593
<i>and eyes that glow in the dark?</i>

16:51.635 --> 16:53.721
<i>I'm telling you what I saw.</i>

16:58.892 --> 17:01.520
<i>How long you been using here?</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:04.398
<i>Couple months.</i>

17:04.440 --> 17:06.692
<i>You ever seen this guy around?</i>

17:15.909 --> 17:17.411
<i>He showed up this morning,</i>

17:17.453 --> 17:19.830
<i>talking about how
he's got a job now.</i>

17:19.872 --> 17:21.707
<i>- Last time he said that--
- He was dealing.</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:23.125
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:23.167 --> 17:24.710
<i>I thought his corner was uptown.</i>

17:24.752 --> 17:26.170
<i>It was. I-I just--</i>

17:26.211 --> 17:27.671
<i>I also thought
he was out of the picture.</i>

17:27.713 --> 17:30.883
<i>Look, what am I supposed to do?</i>

17:30.924 --> 17:34.178
<i>Isaiah lights up like
a Christmas tree around his dad.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:37.222
<i>It's not like that boy
is flush with friends.</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:48.984
<i>Not there, freak.</i>

17:50.110 --> 17:52.237
Keep going.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.585
<i>Hey. Cool trench coat.</i>

18:08.504 --> 18:10.672
<i>Doing anything
for the talent show?</i>

18:10.714 --> 18:12.841
<i>Talent shows are for losers.</i>

18:14.802 --> 18:16.595
<i>Totally.</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:20.933
<i>- Want to see something cool?
- Jesus Christ.</i>

18:31.777 --> 18:33.737
<i>slow, haunting music</i>

18:44.456 --> 18:46.125
<i>Hard to dance</i>

18:46.166 --> 18:47.709
<i>With a devil on your back</i>

18:47.751 --> 18:49.837
<i>So shake him off</i>

18:49.878 --> 18:51.463
<i>Whoa-oh</i>

18:54.424 --> 18:58.470
<i>And I am done
with my graceless heart</i>

18:58.512 --> 19:02.391
<i>So tonight I'm gonna
cut it out and then restart</i>

19:02.432 --> 19:06.687
<i>'Cause I like to keep
my issues drawn</i>

19:06.728 --> 19:10.941
<i>It's always darkest
before the dawn...</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:13.443
<i>tense music</i>

19:15.779 --> 19:17.781
Shake it out

19:17.823 --> 19:20.576
<i>Shake it out, oh-whoa</i>

19:22.661 --> 19:25.414
<i>upbeat music</i>

19:25.455 --> 19:27.499
<i>Ready, Chef.</i>

19:34.631 --> 19:36.592
<i>What do you want, old man?
A medal?</i>

19:36.633 --> 19:38.343
<i>Keep going.</i>

19:55.485 --> 19:58.655
<i>Figured you'd want
to be paid in cash.</i>

20:01.491 --> 20:03.493
<i>Tomorrow's shift starts
at 9:00.</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:06.622
<i>According to Danielle,
you're not a total lost cause.</i>

20:06.663 --> 20:10.209
Come on, grab a seat.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.668
<i>Oh, no.
I got to get back to Ellie.</i>

20:11.710 --> 20:12.836
<i>Man, sit your ass down.</i>

20:14.588 --> 20:16.798
<i>- No, really. I got to go.
- I just gave you a job.</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:19.092
<i>Don't be an asshole.</i>

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:29.269 --> 20:31.063
<i>To my goddaughter.</i>

20:39.947 --> 20:42.449
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.409
<i>- Oh.
- Oh, God-- See?</i>

20:44.451 --> 20:46.620
<i>It's like drinking
Kathleen Turner's voice.</i>

20:46.662 --> 20:48.121
Wow.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.790
<i>I have 'em make a barrel
for the restaurant</i>

20:49.831 --> 20:51.208
<i>and a whole nother one
just for me.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:53.293
<i>- Ah, you haven't changed.
- Yeah.</i>

20:53.335 --> 20:54.962
<i>A little fatter, maybe.</i>

20:55.003 --> 20:56.588
<i>Ladies don't seem to mind.</i>

20:56.630 --> 20:58.799
<i>- Still a bachelor, I take it?
- Well,</i>

20:58.840 --> 21:00.425
<i>I did meet the perfect woman,</i>

21:00.467 --> 21:02.594
<i>but she married
my best friend instead.</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:07.766
<i>Why are you back?</i>

21:09.643 --> 21:11.603
<i>'Cause if you're gonna be
in this restaurant,</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:14.273
<i>I need to know
what just walked in that door.</i>

21:18.151 --> 21:21.280
<i>Me and Ellie can't really stay
in one place for long before--</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:23.573
<i>Before she needs a meal?</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:27.244
<i>I-I was gonna say before
people begin asking questions,</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:29.329
<i>- and we have to run.
- And that's different here?</i>

21:30.914 --> 21:32.833
<i>- Maybe.
- Yeah? Why?</i>

21:35.794 --> 21:37.921
<i>Because of all
the murders going on?</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:41.300
<i>And while the police
have their hands full with that,</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:43.260
<i>you can go about your business
unnoticed?</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:45.595
<i>- Just hold on. No, no, just--
- Oh, Jesus Christ.</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:46.972
<i>- Get the fuck out of here.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

21:47.014 --> 21:48.265
<i>- And don't come back!
- Let me explain.</i>

21:48.307 --> 21:50.267
<i>We had a deal!</i>

21:50.309 --> 21:52.269
<i>Listen, the only reason I agreed</i>

21:52.311 --> 21:54.438
<i>to keep Eleanor's secret
was because you promised</i>

21:54.479 --> 21:56.148
<i>that you would never stop
looking for a cure.</i>

21:56.189 --> 21:58.442
<i>What the fuck do you think
we've been doing?</i>

21:58.483 --> 22:00.986
<i>We've been everywhere!</i>

22:01.028 --> 22:05.032
<i>There were these murders
up in Canada.</i>

22:05.073 --> 22:07.159
<i>Bodies drained of blood.</i>

22:07.200 --> 22:10.704
<i>Since I heard of that,
we packed our bags and went,</i>

22:10.746 --> 22:13.165
<i>thinking that this has to be...</i>

22:16.376 --> 22:17.919
<i>There was nothing.</i>

22:17.961 --> 22:20.088
<i>It was just some sick asshole</i>

22:20.130 --> 22:23.258
<i>who liked
to preserve his victims' bodies.</i>

22:23.300 --> 22:25.427
<i>And-and later on,</i>

22:25.469 --> 22:29.181
<i>I heard about a killer who left
bite marks on his victims.</i>

22:29.222 --> 22:32.434
<i>And again, we packed and went.</i>

22:32.476 --> 22:34.478
<i>And again, nothing.</i>

22:34.519 --> 22:37.856
<i>And then again
and again and again.</i>

22:37.898 --> 22:39.775
<i>And every time, I promise Ellie,</i>

22:39.816 --> 22:41.860
<i>"Honey, this time,
it's different.</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:45.530
<i>This time
we will find the monster</i>

22:45.572 --> 22:48.158
<i>that did this to you,</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:50.744
<i>and that will lead us
to a cure."</i>

22:51.870 --> 22:54.373
<i>And every time
I would bring her hopes high,</i>

22:54.414 --> 22:56.750
<i>and then shatter them to pieces.</i>

22:58.710 --> 23:00.837
<i>I want to help,</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:05.008
<i>but just having you here puts
everyone who works for me--</i>

23:05.050 --> 23:08.178
<i>my family--
at risk.</i>

23:08.220 --> 23:10.722
<i>And I can't do that</i>

23:10.764 --> 23:12.265
<i>just so you can have cover
while you--</i>

23:12.307 --> 23:14.434
<i>No, that's not the only--
That's-- Listen to me.</i>

23:14.476 --> 23:17.938
<i>That's not the only reason
why we're back.</i>

23:17.979 --> 23:20.857
<i>These murders in Midtown,</i>

23:20.899 --> 23:23.693
<i>every one of them happened
at night,</i>

23:23.735 --> 23:26.738
<i>and the nature
of the killings...</i>

23:26.780 --> 23:28.240
<i>There's a savagery--</i>

23:28.281 --> 23:30.075
<i>You're saying that
you think the killer's a--</i>

23:30.117 --> 23:32.077
<i>No. I-I don't know.</i>

23:32.119 --> 23:34.246
<i>And as far as Ellie knows,</i>

23:34.287 --> 23:36.998
<i>the only reason we're back</i>

23:37.040 --> 23:39.668
<i>is to stop...</i>

23:39.709 --> 23:42.087
<i>running.</i>

23:43.213 --> 23:47.092
<i>It's been a nightmare,
the last ten years.</i>

23:47.134 --> 23:50.512
<i>She deserves better.</i>

23:50.554 --> 23:54.808
<i>She deserves
something resembling a life.</i>

24:01.440 --> 24:03.400
<i>slow, contemplative music</i>

24:33.680 --> 24:34.806
Hello?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.897
<i>Are you okay?</i>

24:41.938 --> 24:43.982
<i>You're not wearing shoes.</i>

24:45.025 --> 24:47.319
<i>Aren't you cold?</i>

24:47.360 --> 24:49.321
<i>I don't get cold.</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:51.114
<i>How come?</i>

24:51.156 --> 24:53.867
<i>I guess I've forgotten how.</i>

24:59.247 --> 25:01.166
<i>Do you live here?</i>

25:02.459 --> 25:04.419
<i>I live next door to you.</i>

25:04.461 --> 25:07.506
<i>How do you know where I live?</i>

25:07.547 --> 25:10.175
Whoa.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.385
<i>Was that you?</i>

25:14.387 --> 25:17.098
<i>You must be really hungry.</i>

25:17.140 --> 25:18.808
<i>I am.</i>

25:18.850 --> 25:20.060
<i>Oh.</i>

25:23.939 --> 25:25.524
<i>Here.</i>

25:28.193 --> 25:29.861
<i>You can have it if you want.</i>

25:29.903 --> 25:31.363
<i>I was saving it for later.</i>

25:31.404 --> 25:32.697
<i>I can't eat chocolate.</i>

25:32.739 --> 25:34.533
<i>Seriously?</i>

25:34.574 --> 25:36.868
<i>I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't eat chocolate.</i>

25:36.910 --> 25:39.037
<i>I love chocolate.</i>

25:45.669 --> 25:48.213
<i>You could... eat it for me.</i>

25:49.214 --> 25:50.966
<i>What?</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:54.386
<i>You could eat,
and I could watch.</i>

25:56.012 --> 25:58.598
<i>That's weird.</i>

25:59.599 --> 26:01.560
<i>You're right. Forget it.</i>

26:01.601 --> 26:02.602
<i>No.</i>

26:02.644 --> 26:04.854
<i>It's...</i>

26:04.896 --> 26:06.648
<i>I don't mind.</i>

26:06.690 --> 26:08.650
<i>slow, gentle music</i>

26:26.585 --> 26:28.962
<i>It's good, huh?</i>

26:29.004 --> 26:30.463
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26:30.505 --> 26:32.799
<i>It's so good.</i>

26:34.384 --> 26:36.094
Sweetheart?

26:43.310 --> 26:45.770
<i>Hi, Mr. Mark.</i>

26:50.233 --> 26:53.361
<i>I got to go.
Thanks for the chocolate.</i>

27:07.917 --> 27:10.211
<i>Can I help you?</i>

27:10.253 --> 27:14.174
<i>Yeah. I'm-I'm looking
for something for my son.</i>

27:14.215 --> 27:16.259
<i>- Birthday?
- Sorry?</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:18.637
Is it a special occasion?

27:19.638 --> 27:22.223
<i>I was an asshole this morning.</i>

27:22.265 --> 27:24.267
<i>Hmm.</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:26.394
<i>- How old is he?
- Twelve.</i>

27:26.436 --> 27:28.563
<i>I was gonna guess that.</i>

27:28.605 --> 27:31.358
<i>And he, um... he gets picked on,</i>

27:31.399 --> 27:33.109
<i>so if we could avoid anything
that's gonna make--</i>

27:33.151 --> 27:35.779
<i>You're saying to steer clear
of the never-ending scarf.</i>

27:35.820 --> 27:37.656
I have just the thing.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.585
<i>Oh, I-I should've... Uh...</i>

27:50.627 --> 27:55.173
<i>He's more into the, uh,
coins and cards.</i>

27:55.215 --> 27:58.009
<i>Trust me, this...</i>

27:58.051 --> 28:00.011
<i>is gonna freak...</i>

28:00.053 --> 28:02.013
<i>his classmates out.</i>

28:02.055 --> 28:05.225
<i>Yeah, I-I just don't think
he's really</i>

28:05.266 --> 28:07.560
<i>trying to-- Oh.</i>

28:07.602 --> 28:10.188
<i>Okay. Wow. That is, uh--</i>

28:10.230 --> 28:12.148
<i>So real. [chuckles] I know.</i>

28:12.190 --> 28:14.901
<i>Even the grown-ups can't
figure out how it's done.</i>

28:14.943 --> 28:18.697
<i>Well, isn't...
isn't that just a, uh...</i>

28:18.738 --> 28:22.742
<i>a pump in the needle and
some rubber glue on your arm?</i>

28:22.784 --> 28:24.494
<i>Also, that's not...
that's not really the way</i>

28:24.536 --> 28:26.538
<i>a puncture wound bleeds,
and the... and the color</i>

28:26.579 --> 28:28.206
<i>of the blood isn't real...</i>

28:28.248 --> 28:31.042
<i>- Sorry.
- So,</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:33.128
<i>cards and coins?</i>

28:33.169 --> 28:35.422
<i>Yeah, yeah. He likes, um,</i>

28:35.463 --> 28:37.298
<i>palm of the hand,</i>

28:37.340 --> 28:41.094
<i>make things vanish
and-and reappear.</i>

28:41.136 --> 28:42.721
<i>Hmm.</i>

28:42.762 --> 28:45.098
<i>What?</i>

28:45.140 --> 28:48.226
<i>I suspect he'll like this.</i>

28:50.186 --> 28:53.982
<i>Now, wait. Just, um,
why'd you go, "Hmm"?</i>

28:54.023 --> 28:56.234
<i>The magic your son is doing,</i>

28:56.276 --> 28:59.738
<i>it's pretty sophisticated.</i>

28:59.779 --> 29:01.489
<i>Delicate, even.</i>

29:01.531 --> 29:04.743
<i>Qualities rarely appreciated
by 12-year-old boys.</i>

29:04.784 --> 29:06.619
<i>If you want him
to make friends,</i>

29:06.661 --> 29:09.706
<i>I'd get him the needle instead.</i>

29:12.459 --> 29:14.544
<i>Hmm.</i>

29:20.300 --> 29:23.303
<i>- Just say it, okay?
- What?</i>

29:23.344 --> 29:25.930
<i>You clearly don't like
that I was talking to that boy.</i>

29:26.973 --> 29:29.142
<i>I want nothing more than for you</i>

29:29.184 --> 29:31.728
<i>to have someone
to talk to besides me.</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:35.064
<i>You just have to be careful,
that's it.</i>

29:35.106 --> 29:37.150
<i>I didn't even tell him my name.</i>

29:42.989 --> 29:44.991
<i>You're not worried about me.</i>

29:46.075 --> 29:48.620
<i>You're worried
I'd do something to him.</i>

29:53.541 --> 29:55.502
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

30:07.096 --> 30:09.766
Whoa.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.976
<i>It's cool, huh?</i>

30:12.018 --> 30:13.561
<i>- It's okay.
- Oh, come on.</i>

30:13.603 --> 30:15.647
<i>It's okay.</i>

30:17.106 --> 30:19.150
Wow.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.153
<i>slow, thoughtful music</i>

30:46.553 --> 30:48.012
Galaxies are like islands

30:48.054 --> 30:50.014
<i>in the sea of space.</i>

30:50.056 --> 30:53.977
<i>They glow with the light
of billions of suns.</i>

30:58.731 --> 31:01.860
<i>The Hubble telescope reveals
nearby galaxies</i>

31:01.901 --> 31:03.361
<i>in exquisite detail.</i>

31:05.697 --> 31:09.367
<i>Galaxies like these
fill the universe.</i>

31:12.579 --> 31:15.957
<i>It takes billions of years
for their light to reach us.</i>

31:15.999 --> 31:20.545
<i>We see them not as they are
but as they once were.</i>

31:22.046 --> 31:23.715
Hello?

31:23.756 --> 31:25.300
The kitchen, baby.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.636
<i>What's going on in here?</i>

31:28.678 --> 31:30.722
<i>- Okay.
- How was work?</i>

31:30.763 --> 31:32.307
Good.

31:34.350 --> 31:35.894
<i>Ooh.</i>

31:35.935 --> 31:38.730
<i>- Is that from Hubble?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

31:45.153 --> 31:46.779
You okay?

31:50.783 --> 31:52.744
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:52.785 --> 31:54.037
<i>You good?</i>

31:59.500 --> 32:01.628
<i>- We got to get you home.
- It was just a pang.</i>

32:01.669 --> 32:03.296
<i>Eleanor.</i>

32:03.338 --> 32:06.424
<i>I'll be fine till tomorrow,
I promise.</i>

32:07.467 --> 32:10.386
<i>Let's not ruin tonight, okay?</i>

32:11.387 --> 32:13.723
<i>Where would you like
to go next?</i>

32:19.395 --> 32:20.605
<i>What?</i>

32:38.831 --> 32:40.875
<i>All right. Coast is clear.</i>

32:49.008 --> 32:50.969
<i>slow, majestic music</i>

33:27.630 --> 33:29.674
<i>dramatic music</i>

33:33.302 --> 33:35.847
Stay there!

35:33.631 --> 35:37.301
Shit. [grunts] Fuck.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.053
<i>Shit! [groans]</i>

36:08.040 --> 36:09.458
<i>Yah!</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:20.511
<i>- Dad, help!
- Ellie!</i>

36:25.600 --> 36:26.809
I'll get him.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.903
Why are you checking for fangs?

36:36.944 --> 36:38.738
<i>- Doesn't make any sense.
- Why</i>

36:38.779 --> 36:40.239
<i>- are you checking for fangs?
- See his eyes?</i>

36:40.281 --> 36:42.617
<i>Look at his eyes.</i>

36:42.658 --> 36:44.160
See how they're glowing?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.620
<i>Because you just shined a light
in his eyes.</i>

36:45.661 --> 36:47.455
He was strong like you.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.165
<i>Do you see a bite mark?</i>

36:49.207 --> 36:50.833
<i>No.</i>

36:50.875 --> 36:52.376
<i>Did he try and drink your blood?</i>

36:52.418 --> 36:54.295
<i>- No.
- Because he's not like me.</i>

36:54.337 --> 36:56.464
<i>You told me
we were done with this.</i>

36:57.423 --> 36:59.217
<i>How long till he wakes up?</i>

36:59.258 --> 37:01.219
<i>20 minutes. Maybe less.</i>

37:01.260 --> 37:03.930
<i>We should stop wasting time.</i>

37:03.971 --> 37:07.266
<i>I don't think I can make it
till tomorrow, not anymore.</i>

37:09.352 --> 37:12.772
<i>dramatic string music</i>

37:12.813 --> 37:14.899
<i>All right.</i>

37:17.944 --> 37:20.947
Okay.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.578
<i>What's wrong?</i>

37:27.620 --> 37:29.830
<i>- He's on something.
- What?</i>

37:29.872 --> 37:32.959
<i>I don't know.
It's nothing I've tasted before.</i>

37:46.889 --> 37:50.101
<i>I would like us
to raise our 7UPs</i>

37:50.142 --> 37:52.561
<i>and thank your mother
for this fantastic meal.</i>

37:52.603 --> 37:55.439
I don't know about fantastic.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.275
Excuse me.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.903
<i>Hey, your mother worked
very hard on this dinner.</i>

38:00.945 --> 38:03.489
<i>Although it wouldn't kill you
to add a little salt.</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:04.573
<i>I know, right?</i>

38:06.325 --> 38:08.828
<i>You are most welcome
to cook next time.</i>

38:11.789 --> 38:13.666
<i>What?</i>

38:13.708 --> 38:15.543
<i>You said "next time."</i>

38:15.584 --> 38:17.295
<i>Mm.</i>

38:19.338 --> 38:21.924
<i>Ah. [smacks lips]</i>

38:25.136 --> 38:27.596
<i>We try not to have our phones
at the table.</i>

38:27.638 --> 38:30.266
<i>Oh. Sorry.</i>

38:33.811 --> 38:35.688
<i>I'll be back in a second.</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:45.072
<i>I got to run, little man.</i>

38:45.114 --> 38:48.284
<i>You got any, uh, magic
to show me before I go?</i>

38:48.326 --> 38:49.827
<i>Actually...</i>

38:49.869 --> 38:51.996
<i>What?</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:54.206
<i>There's this talent show
tomorrow night at school.</i>

38:54.248 --> 38:55.666
<i>I was gonna skip it,
but if you--</i>

38:55.708 --> 38:57.126
<i>What time's the show?</i>

38:57.168 --> 38:59.920
<i>- Seven.
- Ah.</i>

38:59.962 --> 39:03.758
<i>Hey, I got a coin
for you to practice with.</i>

39:03.799 --> 39:06.969
<i>- Dad, I have quarters.
- No, but this one is lucky.</i>

39:07.011 --> 39:08.387
<i>How come?</i>

39:08.429 --> 39:10.181
<i>Check out the year.</i>

39:12.892 --> 39:15.811
<i>Boom. [laughs]</i>

39:17.021 --> 39:19.607
<i>See you around, David Blaine.</i>

39:33.496 --> 39:35.915
<i>You sure you're not hurt?</i>

39:35.956 --> 39:38.376
<i>I'm fine.
Let's just go home.</i>

39:38.417 --> 39:41.879
<i>All right, look, I'm gonna
meet you there, okay?</i>

39:43.839 --> 39:45.800
<i>What?</i>

39:45.841 --> 39:47.259
<i>What's wrong?</i>

39:47.301 --> 39:49.720
<i>Hey, Ellie? Hey.</i>

39:49.762 --> 39:51.347
<i>We were having a good day.</i>

39:51.972 --> 39:55.184
<i>I can't remember the last time
we had. And then you leave me</i>

39:55.226 --> 39:56.852
<i>- to chase down--
- Now, just hold on one second.</i>

39:56.894 --> 39:58.562
<i>You're the one who said
we have to be careful.</i>

39:58.604 --> 40:01.107
<i>That we'll only get to stay here
if we're super careful.</i>

40:01.148 --> 40:02.733
<i>And then you go running
into a freaking sewer</i>

40:02.775 --> 40:05.111
<i>- and almost get yourself killed.
- Okay. Okay, okay.</i>

40:05.736 --> 40:08.823
<i>You're right. That was reckless,
and I'm sorry.</i>

40:08.864 --> 40:10.658
<i>And-and-and you were
absolutely right</i>

40:10.699 --> 40:12.410
<i>when you said
that man wasn't like you.</i>

40:12.451 --> 40:15.413
<i>But he was on some drug
that you'd never tasted before.</i>

40:15.454 --> 40:17.540
<i>Look, listen!</i>

40:17.581 --> 40:20.501
<i>Whatever he was on
had him acting like you.</i>

40:20.543 --> 40:22.336
<i>So maybe
there's still something here.</i>

40:22.378 --> 40:23.712
<i>I need to eat.</i>

40:23.754 --> 40:25.548
<i>I know that disgusts you, but--</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:27.007
<i>No, it doesn't disgust me.</i>

40:27.049 --> 40:28.426
<i>- Yes, it does.
- It doesn't!</i>

40:28.467 --> 40:30.177
<i>You can't even look at me
when I feed.</i>

40:30.219 --> 40:31.512
<i>Nah, I don't have time
for that shit right now, Ellie.</i>

40:31.554 --> 40:33.055
<i>- Come on, let's go.
- Then maybe</i>

40:33.097 --> 40:34.598
<i>- I'll go find my own dinner.
- That's-that...</i>

40:34.640 --> 40:36.058
<i>No, no. No,
you-you're not gonna do that.</i>

40:36.100 --> 40:37.268
<i>- Why not?
-'Cause that's the rule.</i>

40:37.309 --> 40:39.061
<i>- You do not do that.
- Why not?!</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:42.606
<i>That's not who you are!</i>

40:46.193 --> 40:47.862
<i>What if it is?</i>

40:49.321 --> 40:51.824
<i>What if this is all
I'll ever be?</i>

40:51.866 --> 40:53.868
<i>It's not.</i>

40:55.119 --> 40:56.954
<i>I promise it's not.</i>

40:56.996 --> 40:58.622
<i>Okay?</i>

41:03.002 --> 41:05.254
<i>Go home, please.</i>

41:06.714 --> 41:08.841
<i>I'll meet you there later, okay?</i>

41:08.883 --> 41:10.634
<i>And I will bring you dinner.</i>

41:10.676 --> 41:11.969
<i>Go.</i>

41:12.011 --> 41:13.971
<i>slow, haunting music</i>

41:14.013 --> 41:17.141
<i></i>

41:32.156 --> 41:35.534
<i>Evening, Dr. Logan.
My name's Matthew.</i>

41:36.535 --> 41:39.163
<i>Your father's waiting
for you inside.</i>

41:44.376 --> 41:46.670
<i>You'll have to forgive
the state of things.</i>

41:46.712 --> 41:49.048
<i>After the lawsuits piled up,
your dad was forced</i>

41:49.089 --> 41:51.258
<i>to let the rest of his staff go.</i>

41:55.262 --> 41:57.223
<i>Poor guy.</i>

41:57.264 --> 41:59.475
<i>Gets millions of people hooked
on painkillers,</i>

41:59.517 --> 42:03.562
<i>and they take everything from
him but his waterfront mansion.</i>

42:03.604 --> 42:05.898
<i>Well, perhaps as you get older,</i>

42:05.940 --> 42:10.277
<i>you'll experience pain in
a more profound and acute way.</i>

42:10.319 --> 42:12.696
<i>And you won't find</i>

42:12.738 --> 42:15.824
<i>its amelioration
such an ignoble pursuit.</i>

42:20.246 --> 42:22.581
<i>Thank you, Matthew.</i>

42:27.419 --> 42:29.380
<i>Welcome home.</i>

42:29.421 --> 42:32.174
<i>This isn't my home.</i>

42:32.216 --> 42:34.385
<i>Well, I left it to you
in my will.</i>

42:34.426 --> 42:36.011
<i>You had something
to tell me about Peter?</i>

42:36.053 --> 42:38.180
<i>"How are you feeling, Dad?</i>

42:38.222 --> 42:40.808
<i>Is there anything
I can do for you?"</i>

42:41.767 --> 42:43.894
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

42:43.936 --> 42:46.647
<i>- Selfish as always.
- Of course you'd bait me here</i>

42:46.689 --> 42:48.065
<i>with Peter,
when really all you want to do</i>

42:48.107 --> 42:49.567
<i>is buy back my forgiveness.</i>

42:49.608 --> 42:51.777
<i>Oh. I see we're still clinging</i>

42:51.819 --> 42:54.530
<i>to the narrative
I was a terrible father.</i>

42:54.572 --> 42:56.282
<i>Uh, no, you were fantastic.</i>

42:56.323 --> 42:58.033
<i>You and Peter wanted
for nothing.</i>

42:58.075 --> 43:00.369
<i>Do you remember what
you told us after Mom took off?</i>

43:01.662 --> 43:03.455
<i>Do you?</i>

43:03.497 --> 43:07.418
<i>You said, "She was always happy
till you two came around."</i>

43:08.377 --> 43:10.713
<i>I raised Peter,</i>

43:10.754 --> 43:14.800
<i>while you were off having
some museum named in your honor.</i>

43:14.842 --> 43:17.970
<i>I was the one helping him
with his homework,</i>

43:18.012 --> 43:22.057
<i>putting him to bed,
putting off college.</i>

43:22.099 --> 43:24.184
<i>And when I finally went,</i>

43:24.226 --> 43:26.353
<i>I hadn't even finished my
freshman year when you called</i>

43:26.395 --> 43:28.606
<i>to tell me
you'd taken him hunting.</i>

43:28.647 --> 43:32.776
<i>And he'd somehow come between
a mother bear and her cub.</i>

43:32.818 --> 43:37.031
<i>And when I came home
for the funeral...</i>

43:37.072 --> 43:41.118
<i>his casket had barely
been put in the ground</i>

43:41.160 --> 43:44.121
<i>when you turned to me
and you said,</i>

43:44.163 --> 43:47.583
<i>"I guess you should be
getting back to school."</i>

43:47.625 --> 43:50.044
<i>So you're right.</i>

43:51.462 --> 43:54.089
<i>You were
Father of the Fucking Year.</i>

43:54.131 --> 43:57.301
<i>Have a nice death.</i>

44:00.346 --> 44:02.348
<i>I never took Peter hunting.</i>

44:02.389 --> 44:04.350
<i>quiet, dramatic music</i>

44:08.103 --> 44:12.691
<i>And what attacked him...</i>

44:12.733 --> 44:14.610
<i>it wasn't a bear.</i>

44:14.652 --> 44:18.822
<i>I'm not leaving you this house</i>

44:18.864 --> 44:20.991
<i>to buy back my guilt.</i>

44:21.033 --> 44:23.160
<i>I need you to continue my work.</i>

44:23.202 --> 44:25.746
<i>For ten years,
I have been trying</i>

44:25.788 --> 44:28.123
<i>to develop a cure,</i>

44:28.165 --> 44:31.168
<i>and I am so close.</i>

44:31.210 --> 44:33.587
<i>A cure for what?</i>

44:35.631 --> 44:37.841
<i>For your brother.</i>

44:39.218 --> 44:41.512
<i>What the fuck are you
talking about?</i>

44:44.556 --> 44:47.017
<i>I can't really talk.
I need to work on my routine.</i>

44:47.059 --> 44:51.855
<i>Hey, speaking of,
I got you something.</i>

44:51.897 --> 44:54.066
<i>You went to Tannen's?!</i>

44:55.651 --> 44:58.028
<i>Oh. Cool, thanks.</i>

44:58.070 --> 45:00.531
<i>Um, that's not all
that's in there.</i>

45:02.408 --> 45:04.993
<i>No way.
Do you even know what this is?</i>

45:05.035 --> 45:08.247
<i>I was just hoping
I didn't pay for an empty bag.</i>

45:09.581 --> 45:11.917
<i>You want to show me
how it works?</i>

45:11.959 --> 45:14.128
<i>You don't like magic.</i>

45:14.169 --> 45:16.255
<i>- That-That's not true.
- Hey,</i>

45:16.296 --> 45:17.756
<i>I saw some kids
out in the courtyard.</i>

45:17.798 --> 45:19.383
<i>Maybe I can show them?</i>

45:19.425 --> 45:21.760
<i>I know you don't want me
to make myself</i>

45:21.802 --> 45:23.762
<i>an easy target.
I just thought maybe</i>

45:23.804 --> 45:25.848
<i>- I could at least try--
- Sweetheart. Sweetheart.</i>

45:25.889 --> 45:27.683
<i>Listen.</i>

45:29.893 --> 45:31.311
<i>Look.</i>

45:31.353 --> 45:35.190
<i>If the world were good,</i>

45:35.232 --> 45:38.402
<i>you could... you could wear
whatever you want</i>

45:38.444 --> 45:41.697
<i>and be exactly who you are.</i>

45:41.739 --> 45:43.699
<i>And if I could do a magic trick,</i>

45:43.741 --> 45:45.993
<i>it'd be to make the world
more like you.</i>

45:46.034 --> 45:49.163
<i>Make it worthy of you.</i>

45:49.204 --> 45:51.582
<i>The world's...</i>

45:57.546 --> 45:59.298
<i>I just want you safe.</i>

46:05.554 --> 46:07.181
I got it.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.104
<i>No further than the courtyard.</i>

46:15.355 --> 46:16.774
<i>Lights out by 9:00.</i>

46:17.733 --> 46:19.777
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

46:28.243 --> 46:30.245
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

46:59.983 --> 47:02.152
<i>Hi, guys. How's it hanging?</i>

47:02.194 --> 47:04.321
<i>Did y'all hear something?</i>

47:04.363 --> 47:06.156
<i>- No. Did you?
- No.</i>

47:06.198 --> 47:08.116
<i>You want to play some Xbox?</i>

47:08.158 --> 47:10.661
<i>Hell yeah,
and I get first player.</i>

47:20.504 --> 47:22.464
<i>tense music</i>

47:45.612 --> 47:47.281
<i>Hey.</i>

47:47.322 --> 47:49.741
<i>How's it hanging?</i>

47:49.783 --> 47:52.202
<i>I mean, how's it going?</i>

47:54.746 --> 47:56.874
<i>Can I show you something
real quick?</i>

47:56.915 --> 47:58.834
<i>But you got to come close.</i>

48:09.177 --> 48:11.013
<i>Just a regular quarter, right?</i>

48:30.073 --> 48:31.950
<i>quiet, gentle music</i>

48:48.342 --> 48:50.010
<i>I don't get it.</i>

48:50.052 --> 48:53.764
<i>Well... [blows]</i>

48:53.805 --> 48:56.808
<i>It's magic.</i>

48:56.850 --> 48:59.269
<i>Whoa.</i>

48:59.311 --> 49:01.271
<i>What?</i>

49:01.313 --> 49:02.773
<i>What's with your eyes?</i>

49:02.814 --> 49:05.943
<i>That's so cool.
How do you make 'em do that?</i>

49:07.903 --> 49:09.696
<i>With magic.</i>

49:09.738 --> 49:11.365
<i>soft, gentle music</i>

49:13.241 --> 49:14.743
<i>I should go.</i>

49:16.703 --> 49:18.956
<i>I'm Isaiah, by the way.</i>

49:21.249 --> 49:24.127
<i>I'm Eleanor.</i>

49:40.310 --> 49:43.105
<i>Excuse me? Hi.</i>

49:43.146 --> 49:44.815
<i>Can I help you?</i>

49:44.856 --> 49:46.400
<i>Uh, yeah. Um,</i>

49:46.441 --> 49:49.736
<i>I'm interested
in what-what you're selling.</i>

49:49.778 --> 49:52.030
<i>What would that be?</i>

49:52.072 --> 49:56.076
<i>I heard
there's something new out there?</i>

49:56.118 --> 49:57.369
<i>Something strong?</i>

49:59.371 --> 50:02.374
<i>No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

50:02.416 --> 50:05.293
<i>I have money.
Look, I'm not a cop.</i>

50:05.335 --> 50:06.920
<i>You have yourself a nice night.</i>

50:06.962 --> 50:09.589
<i>- No, no, no, no. Just wait.
- We're done here.</i>

50:40.787 --> 50:43.206
<i>I'm gonna ask you
some questions,</i>

50:43.248 --> 50:45.375
<i>and if you're honest with me,</i>

50:45.417 --> 50:47.502
<i>there's a chance</i>

50:47.544 --> 50:49.671
<i>you walk out of here alive.</i>

50:49.713 --> 50:51.798
<i>Do you understand?</i>

50:58.472 --> 51:00.515
<i>I found these
in your jacket pocket.</i>

51:00.557 --> 51:02.392
<i>What is it?</i>

51:02.434 --> 51:04.770
<i>I-I don't know.</i>

51:04.811 --> 51:08.023
<i>No, no. Just-just take it easy.
I swear, I-I don't know.</i>

51:08.065 --> 51:09.441
<i>Look, I-I'll tell you everything.</i>

51:09.483 --> 51:12.152
<i>Just-just be cool, okay? Um...</i>

51:12.194 --> 51:14.529
<i>A couple weeks ago,
I was... I was...</i>

51:14.571 --> 51:16.406
<i>I was coming out
of an AA meeting,</i>

51:16.448 --> 51:18.200
<i>and this guy asked me
if I wanted to make some money.</i>

51:18.241 --> 51:19.701
<i>Every night,
he texts me an address.</i>

51:19.743 --> 51:21.411
<i>I go there,
he gives me product to sell.</i>

51:21.453 --> 51:23.705
<i>The next night,
it's a new address.</i>

51:23.747 --> 51:26.541
<i>I go give the man his money, he
gives me more product to sell.</i>

51:26.583 --> 51:27.918
<i>- What is the man's name?
- I-I don't know.</i>

51:27.959 --> 51:29.586
<i>- What's his number?
- I don't know.</i>

51:29.628 --> 51:33.173
<i>I swear to Christ,
I don't know, okay?</i>

51:33.215 --> 51:36.093
<i>Look, h-he's just a middleman,
but I heard him talking</i>

51:36.134 --> 51:38.261
<i>about some woman who is
in charge of this whole thing.</i>

51:38.303 --> 51:40.764
<i>- What woman?
- I-I don't fucking know.</i>

51:40.806 --> 51:42.682
<i>You are not giving me
anything useful,</i>

51:42.724 --> 51:44.935
<i>- and that is not good for you.
- Okay, listen, listen.</i>

51:44.976 --> 51:46.937
<i>In my jacket pocket,
there's a phone.</i>

51:46.978 --> 51:48.396
<i>The guy that I work for--</i>

51:48.438 --> 51:50.273
<i>he will text me tomorrow
with a new address.</i>

51:50.315 --> 51:53.110
<i>If you want to find this dude,
he will be there tomorrow.</i>

51:58.532 --> 51:59.991
<i>What do you know
about this drug?</i>

52:00.033 --> 52:02.077
<i>Not much.</i>

52:02.119 --> 52:05.247
<i>Uh, the people who buy it say
that-that it's a primal high.</i>

52:05.288 --> 52:07.749
<i>It makes 'em feel like they can
run through walls, except--</i>

52:07.791 --> 52:09.292
<i>Except what?</i>

52:09.334 --> 52:11.461
<i>Apparently,
the hangover's brutal.</i>

52:11.503 --> 52:13.171
<i>Makes them feel like...</i>

52:13.213 --> 52:14.756
<i>When they go out in the sun,
it makes them feel like</i>

52:14.798 --> 52:16.758
<i>their skin is on fire.</i>

52:16.800 --> 52:18.802
<i>W-What else?</i>

52:18.844 --> 52:21.388
<i>That's all I know.</i>

52:21.429 --> 52:23.140
<i>You ever used it yourself?</i>

52:23.181 --> 52:24.933
<i>- No way.
- Don't lie to me!</i>

52:24.975 --> 52:27.227
<i>- I'm not lying.
- If you are not clean,</i>

52:27.269 --> 52:29.646
<i>you have to say it now.</i>

52:29.688 --> 52:31.731
<i>Look in my pocket, okay?</i>

52:32.691 --> 52:34.901
<i>My pants pocket,
look inside, okay?</i>

52:34.943 --> 52:37.154
<i>Okay. Okay. Shh.</i>

52:40.282 --> 52:43.076
<i>See? Three months.</i>

52:43.118 --> 52:45.787
<i>I haven't had a drink,
much less a drug. I am clean.</i>

52:45.829 --> 52:49.166
<i>Didn't mean to get mixed up
in this shit, man. I just...</i>

52:49.207 --> 52:50.667
<i>I just have a... I have a son.</i>

52:50.709 --> 52:52.377
<i>I-I don't want to hear
about your family.</i>

52:52.419 --> 52:54.171
<i>Yeah, I'm try-trying to make
some money, and I can't</i>

52:54.212 --> 52:55.672
<i>- even take 'em to dinner.
- I don't want to hear about it.</i>

52:55.714 --> 52:56.715
<i>- I can't get an apartment.
- Please stop that!</i>

52:56.756 --> 52:57.799
<i>I'm not gonna say it again!</i>

52:57.841 --> 52:59.176
<i>Do you have a kid? [panting]</i>

53:01.761 --> 53:03.638
<i>Then you know.</i>

53:03.680 --> 53:05.515
<i>You know.</i>

53:07.225 --> 53:09.686
<i>That boy is
my light in the dark.</i>

53:09.728 --> 53:12.147
And I want to see him again.

53:12.189 --> 53:13.732
<i>And I am so sorry</i>

53:13.773 --> 53:16.318
<i>that I got mixed up
in all this mess, man.</i>

53:16.359 --> 53:18.528
<i>I'm-I'm just trying
to take care of my kid.</i>

53:18.570 --> 53:21.198
So am I.

<i>pulsating, dramatic music</i>

54:18.630 --> 54:20.548
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

54:35.230 --> 54:37.274
<i>This way.</i>

54:42.112 --> 54:44.114
<i>eerie, haunting music</i>

54:50.078 --> 54:53.873
<i>I pulled him out of the sun
before it was too late.</i>

54:56.668 --> 55:00.046
<i>You should brace yourself
for what you're about to see.</i>

55:44.841 --> 55:46.176
<i>Claire?</i>

55:51.389 --> 55:54.017
<i>Is that really you?</i>

56:05.862 --> 56:07.822
Yeah.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.867
<i>Yeah. [laughs]</i>

56:10.909 --> 56:14.537
<i>Pete. [sniffles, cries]</i>

56:23.380 --> 56:26.049
<i>I'm here.</i>

56:30.428 --> 56:32.722
I can't believe it's you.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.310
<i>You look so...</i>

56:37.352 --> 56:39.646
What?

56:39.687 --> 56:41.689
Grown-up.

57:57.807 --> 58:00.810
<i>"Sweet Child O' Mine"

58:43.728 --> 58:47.232
<i>She's got a smile
that it seems to me</i>

58:47.273 --> 58:50.902
<i>Reminds me
of childhood memories</i>

58:50.944 --> 58:53.613
<i>Where everything was
as fresh</i>

58:53.655 --> 58:56.866
<i>As the bright blue sky</i>

58:59.077 --> 59:02.288
<i>Now and then
when I see her face</i>

59:02.330 --> 59:05.792
<i>She takes me away
to that special place</i>

59:05.833 --> 59:08.044
<i>And if I stare too long</i>

59:08.086 --> 59:11.673
<i>I'd probably break down
and cry</i>
