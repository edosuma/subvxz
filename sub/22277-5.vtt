00:06.600 --> 00:09.600
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero.

00:09.633 --> 00:11.900
Summer is quickly
coming to an end.

00:11.933 --> 00:13.433
SUE: I have to fill
my freezer.

00:13.467 --> 00:14.867
Susie likes to be chunky.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.867
NARRATOR:
Blood thirsty bugs invade
Glenn's mountain paradise.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.767
(COUGHS) I got a mosquito
in my throat right now.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.100
The Hailstones are looking to
strike it rich.

00:25.133 --> 00:28.100
CHIP: I could be floating over
$20,000 mammoth tusk
as we speak.

00:28.633 --> 00:29.833
I found it!

00:29.867 --> 00:32.867
And Andy battles the Yukon
for a summer catch.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.167
ANDY:
I'm using a net this year,
a small mesh net.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.633
Nothing in the net.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.167
Jesus Christ.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.967
I've got a couple of
beautiful bulls that way.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.867
I've got a major winter storm
coming in.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.567
It's due to hit tonight
or tomorrow.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.633
Gonna be here for a week.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.633
Lots of snow,
ice and freezing.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.133
I mean, my winter
is gonna set in.

01:03.167 --> 01:04.833
It's... It's...

01:04.867 --> 01:06.267
The middle of August,

01:06.300 --> 01:07.900
and I'm worried about winter.

01:07.933 --> 01:10.833
So, I have to fill my freezer.

01:10.867 --> 01:13.667
Susie likes to be chunky.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.433
NARRATOR:
Although the sun stays above
the horizon in Kavik

01:16.467 --> 01:17.767
for more than two months,

01:17.800 --> 01:19.367
winter will soon return

01:19.400 --> 01:22.133
and the caribou will travel
out of Sue's reach.

01:24.967 --> 01:27.100
Caribou are called
ghosts of the tundra.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.633
You won't see anything
and then all of a sudden

01:29.667 --> 01:31.367
they're popping up everywhere.

01:33.067 --> 01:35.267
They're hanging here.
They're over there.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.633
I say,
I get into the river bed,

01:37.667 --> 01:39.667
try to snake my way over,
see if I can get 'em.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.133
Pony up, girls.
It's time to go.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.233
See, they're on the top,

01:51.267 --> 01:52.900
and they're still
quite a ways away.

01:54.833 --> 01:57.067
But I got a lot of
open ground without trees.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.200
He's walking away.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.100
He's standing there
looking dumb.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.333
There's a baby.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.167
Okay, so let's
think like a caribou.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.967
What I'm going to do...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.567
There's a little change
in elevation right here.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.667
They're happy grazing
right now.

02:17.933 --> 02:21.033
The wind kind of sucks
for what I'm doing.

02:21.067 --> 02:22.533
That's why these guys,

02:22.567 --> 02:23.933
by the time
I get part way out,

02:23.967 --> 02:25.967
those guys are gonna
scent me and be gone.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
These guys, as long as
I keep it kind of low

02:29.033 --> 02:31.500
and scooch around,
I might stand a chance.

02:31.533 --> 02:32.800
At some point I'm gonna
have to cross

02:32.833 --> 02:34.233
absolutely open tundra.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.367
That is a long shot.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.067
I can't do that shot.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.500
That is probably 400 yards,
500 yards.

02:44.533 --> 02:45.867
I've got to get
my ass out there.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.733
I can get a little closer.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.600
Let's try it.

02:49.633 --> 02:52.167
So I'm gonna slip down here,
kind of crawl,

02:52.200 --> 02:55.100
hopefully get close enough
without anybody seeing me.

03:02.733 --> 03:05.400
I'm gonna cross
a lot of open country.
They may see me.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.900
GLENN: I just feel really well
living out here.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.467
I just can't imagine
wanting to live anywhere else.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.800
And I feel really alive
out here

03:17.833 --> 03:19.400
in a way that I don't
when I'm not here.

03:28.733 --> 03:31.467
This is my sod house
where I keep meat, mostly,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.100
when I'm trying to
keep it cooler in the spring

03:33.133 --> 03:34.300
when it warms up here.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.333
Sod is just the roots
and some of the soil

03:37.367 --> 03:39.167
that's on the top
of the ground.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.000
This makes really good
insulation

03:41.033 --> 03:43.367
and it's got some holes
in the sod.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.567
It's been a long time
since I patched it up.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.167
Right now,
the little chickadees,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.600
they fly right through
those cracks.

03:49.633 --> 03:51.467
So, I need to get
some more sod to put on it

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
to get it back in condition.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.467
I'm looking for an area
where there's moss
growing on the ground.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.900
And it's not easy
to find around here

03:57.933 --> 04:00.800
but there's a place
about a quarter mile
down the lake.

04:00.833 --> 04:04.167
NARRATOR: Summertime
brings huge swarms
of hungry mosquitoes

04:04.200 --> 04:06.667
that makes Glenn's
every task miserable.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.833
I just got to go
look for my head net.

04:08.867 --> 04:11.300
I think I might have
left it over here
when I was grayling fishing.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.600
Pretty essential.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.333
Wouldn't want to head out
of here without a head net.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.733
It's bug season so

04:15.767 --> 04:17.600
they'll eat you up
if you're not protected.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.833
The mosquitoes are
just a big problem out here.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.733
In the summer it's like
the worst thing out here
is the mosquitoes.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.267
If it wasn't for them,
it'd be paradise.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.133
They go for your head.

04:30.167 --> 04:32.667
They're attracted to
carbon dioxide in your breath

04:32.700 --> 04:34.333
and they tend to swarm
around your head.

04:34.367 --> 04:38.133
And that's one of the most
vulnerable places, so...

04:38.167 --> 04:39.467
So, it's real important
to have a head net.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.167
I'm gonna keep looking.

04:45.033 --> 04:46.200
The problem is,

04:46.233 --> 04:48.567
if you don't have a way
to protect yourself,

04:48.600 --> 04:51.933
everything you do
becomes a lot harder

04:51.967 --> 04:54.500
when you're just constantly
being harassed by mosquitoes.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.333
You're just getting
hundreds of bites

04:56.367 --> 04:58.200
and it just wears you out.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.000
A human couldn't live out here
without a way

05:03.033 --> 05:04.700
to protect themselves
from the mosquitoes.

05:04.733 --> 05:08.133
And I sewed this shirt out of
a really tight-woven cotton

05:08.167 --> 05:09.633
that they usually
don't bite through.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.267
They usually
don't get through my pants,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.333
but if you don't have anything
to protect you,

05:13.367 --> 05:14.767
you won't last long out here.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.133
This isn't a place where
you'd want to end up
naked on the tundra.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.400
You'll get eaten alive.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.167
Mosquito in my eye.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.600
I did not find
my mosquito net.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.567
(CLEARS THROAT) Got a mosquito
in my throat right now.

05:36.933 --> 05:38.167
Looked everywhere I can
think of

05:38.200 --> 05:40.100
and could not find it.

05:40.133 --> 05:42.200
But I got other things to do
so I'm gonna have to
move on.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.067
Look at this.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.467
How'd that get there?

05:54.367 --> 05:55.800
I have no idea.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.900
(SIGHS) Relief.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.233
Try getting me now.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.100
Little bastards.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.500
CHIP: Since our kids
are grown up enough

06:05.533 --> 06:06.867
that they can watch
themselves.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.867
Me and her in the last
few years have been back to

06:08.900 --> 06:10.667
being really good partners
on a lot of things.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.933
Especially hunting.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.167
Hell, it's all good.

06:22.067 --> 06:24.767
We are going
mammoth tusk hunting.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.233
This is the time of the year
where you can actually

06:27.267 --> 06:30.200
walk down the beach
and find things like,

06:30.233 --> 06:33.267
um, $10,000 piece of tusk

06:33.300 --> 06:35.500
or a real nice tooth.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.967
NARRATOR: Indigenous Alaskans
have a long tradition of

06:38.000 --> 06:39.867
making art from
mammoth remains.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.600
Harvested from
their native lands.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.733
Yep, I'm ready to go
check out the other side
of the lake.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.100
CHIP: Mammoth tusk,
dire wolves.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.400
Maybe even a
10,000-year-old beaver
would be mighty fine.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.333
That you can make
beautiful things out of...

06:49.367 --> 06:50.833
Just recycle them back.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.633
Uh, that she'll sell...
Make something out of it.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.967
Well, you can obviously see
I could use a new boat.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.367
Tusk came along,
I can definitely get
a new boat.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.033
It would be really beneficial.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.067
Bye, Mom!

07:01.767 --> 07:03.533
Love you, kids. Be safe now.

07:03.567 --> 07:04.633
Bye!

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
Right on!

07:19.967 --> 07:23.067
And this is how you find them.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.333
NARRATOR:
While it's illegal to remove
mammoth remains

07:25.367 --> 07:26.933
from state and federal lands,

07:26.967 --> 07:29.333
Alaskan natives are exempt
from these laws.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.367
Do you want to walk
or do I walk?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.000
I can get off here.

07:33.033 --> 07:36.333
We're gonna drift on
to see if we spot stuff
away from the shore.

07:36.367 --> 07:37.667
We'll direct you to them.

07:39.867 --> 07:42.333
Oh, man, I can smell
the smell of mammoth

07:42.367 --> 07:44.400
and I can see the dark ground.

07:44.433 --> 07:45.667
(SAWING)

07:45.700 --> 07:47.400
ANDY: Everything
is planning ahead.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.667
Utilising the resources
when they're here.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.133
Nothing is right now, here.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.600
Everything seems to
always be for the future.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.067
Make sure that all the lines
are in front of you

08:05.100 --> 08:06.167
so that when that goes out,

08:06.200 --> 08:08.767
nothing can wrap around you
and toss you out.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.067
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.900
Kate's daughter Jacquie,
who's up visiting for a month,

08:12.933 --> 08:14.100
is here to help us

08:14.133 --> 08:16.933
and to reunite with her mom
and to meet me.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.800
Here's a good
life jacket for you.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.467
JACQUIE: I've never
been here before.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.267
I called my mother and
told her that I'd like
to see her.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.733
She invited me to come
and experience her life
and I jumped at the chance.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.567
To come here
and be with my mom,

08:30.600 --> 08:32.200
and learn her lifestyle

08:32.233 --> 08:34.467
is the chance of
a lifetime for me.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.500
Today I'm gonna see
what she's made of physically,
as far as work.

08:38.533 --> 08:42.733
The king salmon run
on the Yukon river
is in dire straits right now.

08:42.767 --> 08:45.300
It's been tanking
for about a decade now.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.867
And I'm one of the people
that's pretty outspoken

08:47.900 --> 08:50.933
about conservation of
king salmon, so...

08:50.967 --> 08:52.467
To practise
what I'm preaching,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.833
I'm not gonna be using
my fish wheel any more.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.200
I'm using a net this year.
A small mesh net.

08:57.233 --> 08:58.500
So, I'm gonna be learning.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.567
Um, one of the dangers
that you have

09:02.600 --> 09:05.033
when you're net fishing
is buttons.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.800
Or anything like a belt.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.667
If it loops
over your knife handle,

09:08.700 --> 09:10.433
when you go to
let the net back out...

09:10.467 --> 09:13.333
(SWISHES)
It'll just take you with it.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.967
NARRATOR: To set the net
requires a two-step approach.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.500
First, Andy and Jacquie
will drop a carry-line
tied to the shore.

09:20.533 --> 09:22.500
-Is it there?
-Yeah, we're tight.

09:22.533 --> 09:23.800
It will be pulled taut,

09:23.833 --> 09:26.333
and then an anchor will be
released to keep it in place.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.900
Let the ball go.
Just let it go.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.000
JACQUIE: This is heavy.

09:41.033 --> 09:42.067
ANDY: Yeah.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.033
There it goes.

09:45.767 --> 09:46.800
Yeah.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.833
-It's kind of fun. (CHUCKLES)
-Yeah.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.333
Next process
for us to take care of

09:52.367 --> 09:53.667
is that it's a new net.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.533
I need to set the net up
on the ground.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.100
We'll go get Kate,
we'll put everything
in the boats.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.300
And the three of us
will go out

10:01.333 --> 10:02.500
and stretch the line out.

10:04.733 --> 10:05.967
You grab it, Kate.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.567
-Got it?
-Got it!

10:11.600 --> 10:13.500
Kate, hold on to one end.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.300
Jacquie, hold on
to this end here.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.733
Kate, don't let go!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.567
Kate, hold on to it.
We're trying to get the boat

10:20.600 --> 10:22.433
facing the other way.
Okay, girls?

10:22.467 --> 10:23.867
KATE: Got it!
JACQUIE: Yeah!

10:23.900 --> 10:26.267
Walk forward now.
Kate, you walk back.

10:27.967 --> 10:30.267
There you go.
Now you guys can just
ferry the line.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.900
Let go of the line.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.367
-We're going out
to the anchor, okay?
-Okay.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.867
When you just pulled that,
you just pulled my anchor in.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.700
ANDY: You know, we're gonna
go through some struggles.

10:43.733 --> 10:44.967
We're gonna have some tangles,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.500
we're going to have some...

10:46.533 --> 10:49.100
Missed cues on
who's doing what, when.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.100
That's the way to do it.
Just like that. All right.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.900
Now, let's ferry our way
up to the float.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.167
Like everything in life,
experience is knowledge.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.800
And we're gonna gain
a lot of experience

11:01.833 --> 11:04.167
in the next couple of days,
messing with this net.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.700
We're gonna go way upstream

11:06.733 --> 11:07.967
and then we'll
have to re-adjust

11:08.000 --> 11:10.500
once I get out
into this current.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.367
Fishing on the Yukon
can be dangerous.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.267
People drown every year.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.767
From either cold water
or just falling out of boats.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.900
KATE: That line's gonna go
tight on her.

11:22.033 --> 11:23.067
Shit!

11:26.500 --> 11:27.800
Shit.

11:27.833 --> 11:28.833
I'm caught.

11:29.533 --> 11:30.633
Shit!

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
Thank you!

11:34.800 --> 11:36.600
Okay, be ready to
grab the line, Jacquie,

11:36.633 --> 11:38.567
'cause we're gonna
come in relatively fast.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.267
Should be easy to grab now.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.433
You go back there, Kate,
and just sit back there.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.700
-Right on
the little wooden box.
-Okay.

11:43.733 --> 11:44.900
I will pull gently.

11:44.933 --> 11:47.567
No, don't pull anything yet
until your mom's ready.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.400
-Here you got it? All right.
-Oh... I got it.

11:49.433 --> 11:52.200
All right.
Let's go out to the ball.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.267
Gently.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.433
I'm gently, gently going.

11:55.467 --> 11:57.733
All right, slow down,
'cause you got a lot
of momentum.

12:03.433 --> 12:06.833
I think regular net fishermen
are probably laughing
their ass off at me.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.833
Oh, yeah. It's the newbies
out on the river.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.733
"What a dumb-shit?
How come you don't
do it like this?"

12:11.767 --> 12:15.133
This is a technique that
a commercial fisherman

12:15.167 --> 12:17.333
described to me
in a bar one time.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.100
That was about 15 years ago.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.533
And I thought
I'd just give it a try,
see if it works.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.500
All right, Kate,
pull us towards shore.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.833
Okay, stop.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.067
I think we're almost there.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.700
You guys did good on that.

12:34.733 --> 12:35.833
After I get this tied up,

12:35.867 --> 12:37.333
we're gonna go back
along the line

12:37.367 --> 12:39.467
and I'm going to put in
all the shackles,

12:39.500 --> 12:41.100
and then we should be done.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.167
Like everything in my life,

12:42.200 --> 12:43.833
every day is
an experiment for me.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.767
I set the net
non-traditionally.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.867
Kate has never really
net fished with me,

12:47.900 --> 12:49.600
Jacquie's never done it.

12:49.633 --> 12:51.267
Kate, let's go some more.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.600
So we're all a bunch
of greenhorns out here,

12:54.633 --> 12:57.033
trying a totally new method.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.333
I hope we catch
all our fish in one day.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.667
It looks like it's gonna work.
We'll see.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.133
I think we can just let go
and float away.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.400
-Let go?
-Yeah.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.133
One, two, three...
We're fishing!

13:08.167 --> 13:09.733
Yay! (LAUGHS)

13:10.800 --> 13:13.167
Come on fishy, fishy,
fishy, fishies.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.100
All right, nets in.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.167
Just a matter of time now.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.500
KATE: Yes, it is.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.167
GLENN: As enjoyable as it is
living out here,

13:24.200 --> 13:26.500
it's even better
if you've got someone
to share it with.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.300
You know, most of the time
that I lived up here

13:38.333 --> 13:39.467
I wasn't out here alone.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.367
I had a family out here.
I had two kids.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.333
Their mom and I, we split up

13:45.367 --> 13:47.233
a couple of years ago.

13:47.267 --> 13:50.200
Unfortunately,
things just didn't work out.

13:50.233 --> 13:52.067
I'd rather not
be living alone.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.333
But there aren't
a whole lot of people

13:54.367 --> 13:56.867
that want to live the way
I want to live out here.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.233
I'm looking for something
that is mostly just moss.

14:00.267 --> 14:02.400
And a place where
it's easy to cut it.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.900
Where there aren't trees
and limbs in it.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.767
Where there isn't much brush
growing through it

14:07.800 --> 14:09.033
and where it's thick enough.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.100
This place would be
easy to cut

14:13.133 --> 14:14.500
but I think it's
really thin here.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.667
You can just tell
by walking on it,

14:16.700 --> 14:18.967
it's not soft and cushy.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.800
It's hard to find moss
around here

14:20.833 --> 14:22.933
that's good for building
a sod house with.

14:23.667 --> 14:27.067
This here is not the best

14:27.100 --> 14:30.100
but it's probably about
as good as I'm going to find

14:30.133 --> 14:32.067
anywhere close by tonight.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.833
When I cut sod, I use an axe.

14:34.867 --> 14:37.900
Underneath this moss
that I'm getting,

14:37.933 --> 14:39.900
there's dirt
and it's got rocks in it.

14:39.933 --> 14:43.100
That's why I'm not
swinging it very aggressively.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.733
'Cause I don't want to chip it
but it is really hard
on the bit of the axe.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.467
This moss can be used
for a lot of things

14:52.500 --> 14:54.200
besides just the sod house.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.600
If I had some extra,
I'll put it in a pile,

14:56.633 --> 14:57.867
leave it in the yard.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.600
Once it dries out,
it's really good for wick.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.667
I make a lamp sometimes
with it in winter.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.200
Use it to wipe things up
that spill.

15:07.233 --> 15:08.800
I can use it for toilet paper.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.533
Supposed to be antibiotic.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.667
I guess it's good
to put it on a wound.

15:15.933 --> 15:18.267
Dragging down through
this side
one more time.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.267
Pull out as many
of those little roots
as I can.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.200
(GRUNTS)

15:26.233 --> 15:30.567
Now, I'm just
tearing off the roots
on the bottom of it.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.700
Trying to get it
as thick a piece as possible.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.800
Just like a big roll
of fibreglass insulation.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.667
Now, I'm gonna see
if I can carry this thing.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.667
(GRUNTS)

15:43.700 --> 15:44.967
Do it right now.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.567
Shit!

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
(CHUCKLES)

15:56.433 --> 15:57.833
I got to roll that back up.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.433
That's what I wish
I'd brought a cord for.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.200
Tie it so it wouldn't un-roll.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.733
I got the sod.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.933
I got a couple holes
in the house that
I'm gonna patch up.

16:24.967 --> 16:26.567
And then the sod house
will be in good shape

16:26.600 --> 16:27.733
when I get here next fall.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.467
CHIP: We're hunters.
We're opportunists.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.133
And the thing for us to do
as opportunists is

16:36.167 --> 16:37.700
to make the most
out of every opportunity.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.600
'Cause if it passes by you,
then you're poor.

16:50.533 --> 16:51.600
We call it scouting.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.267
We're looking for
nice chunks of wood,

16:54.300 --> 16:55.400
nice pieces of bone.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.333
Anything that we can
make artwork out of.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.333
NARRATOR: Mammoths went extent
nearly 12,000 years ago.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.700
But their remains
are preserved

17:01.733 --> 17:03.400
in the frozen permafrost.

17:03.433 --> 17:05.033
Warmer temperatures
melt the ice

17:05.067 --> 17:07.300
and reveal
the bones in the mud.

17:18.100 --> 17:21.500
We could be floating over
$20,000 mammoth tusk
as we speak.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.567
And I try to jab it with
my little poker here

17:23.600 --> 17:25.333
on the end of this
walrus harpoon.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.800
The ocean sifts out
all the sand

17:27.833 --> 17:29.400
but out here is where
we got to keep our eyes open

17:29.433 --> 17:31.700
for tusks, teeth...

17:31.733 --> 17:33.267
JON: This looks like
a good place to check.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.767
But it is a little sketchy.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.800
This is all permafrost
right here.

17:39.133 --> 17:43.500
Frozen water under a big layer
of mud and sod and tundra.

17:43.533 --> 17:47.000
That could fall anytime.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.367
Found a bone.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.667
Nice big one.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.567
-Antler?
-No.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.567
Looks like a leg bone.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.267
-Is that a mammoth?
-Yeah.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.833
(CHUCKLES) All right.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.733
It might be a femur,
if that's the hip.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.500
AGNES: It's the mammoth.
It's got to be, yeah?

18:09.167 --> 18:10.667
Ooh!

18:10.700 --> 18:12.367
I found it!

18:12.400 --> 18:14.267
That's a tree stump there.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.200
Yep, sure does look like
the end of one, doesn't it?

18:19.233 --> 18:20.633
See what he's got
going on over here?

18:20.667 --> 18:21.900
Looks like a horn.

18:22.733 --> 18:23.733
That's nothing.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.433
Good start.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.800
Well, now here's
something interesting.

18:26.833 --> 18:27.900
This was cut by people.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.000
-You see the cut?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:29.033 --> 18:30.267
They snapped it off.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.500
Here you can see
where they cleanly cut

18:31.533 --> 18:33.967
the base of this
by chopping it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.700
Probably getting themselves
specific pieces and toss this.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.500
This was done a long time ago.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.500
This is all wet mud.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.100
All this permafrost here
is melting like crazy.

18:46.133 --> 18:48.267
New stuff falls down
every day.

18:48.300 --> 18:52.067
All that new stuff is
10,000 plus years old.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.700
AGNES: Sometimes you come out
with little pieces.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.933
Sometimes you come out
with the whole piece
of tusk or bone

18:56.967 --> 19:00.600
or some kind of hoof
or tooth or something.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.900
This is it.
This is what we do.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.100
Playing in the mud all day.

19:03.900 --> 19:04.900
(CHUCKLES)

19:07.533 --> 19:10.000
As you can see over here
there's a big old bluff

19:10.033 --> 19:12.100
with a whole lot
of permafrost.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.667
A mammoth could have
easily gone and died

19:14.700 --> 19:17.700
and 10,000 years later,
have us look for it.

19:17.733 --> 19:21.433
I think, today, we'll get
a whole mammoth tusk or two.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.633
Looks pretty nice.
We're getting to
the interesting parts.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.300
There's a whole lot of
treasure out here.

19:29.267 --> 19:30.433
ANDY: Nobody
gets away from here

19:30.467 --> 19:32.467
without a little bit of work
one way or another.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.233
That's the way it is out here.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.900
This is kind of a
working dude ranch
of the North.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
All right, so what's the bet?

19:50.033 --> 19:53.767
I'm going to say one salmon,
one burbot, one shea.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.367
I'll get one of something.

19:55.700 --> 19:56.767
I hope.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.400
(LAUGHS)

19:58.433 --> 20:01.700
NARRATOR: Andy's opted
for fishing king salmon
in a sustainable way

20:01.733 --> 20:03.433
using a simple net.

20:03.467 --> 20:07.233
He's about to find out
if the eco-friendly gamble
pays off.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.733
ANDY: To practise what
I'm preaching,

20:08.767 --> 20:10.867
I'm not going to be using
my fish wheel any more

20:10.900 --> 20:12.933
as a matter of
trying to provide

20:12.967 --> 20:15.067
some conservation for
the king salmon

20:15.100 --> 20:17.667
so it has less of an impact
on the overall run.

20:42.867 --> 20:43.933
Great. Nothing in the net.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.033
Nothing?

20:46.767 --> 20:47.800
That's not good.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.100
ANDY: Jesus Christ.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.100
I'm gonna take you guys
to shore.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.267
And then, I'm gonna
fuck around with some
other stuff, okay?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
Yeah.

21:04.967 --> 21:05.967
Oh, well.

21:13.867 --> 21:14.867
KATE: Careful, Jacquie.

21:16.533 --> 21:17.833
Don't tie it off,
just leave it.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.133
I'm gonna go back out.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.433
Yeah, I'm pulling my net out.

21:35.467 --> 21:37.267
I've got better things to do
with my time

21:37.300 --> 21:38.667
than fuck around with this.

21:45.467 --> 21:47.633
A lot of important things
to do this summer

21:47.667 --> 21:49.733
that I can't dedicate
all day long

21:49.767 --> 21:51.333
just to fishing right now.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.267
SUE:
Most people, where they live,
it's the middle of August.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.567
They're still thinking about
putting on the bikini

22:00.600 --> 22:03.633
and drinking coconut drinks
with little hats.

22:03.667 --> 22:06.133
For me, I'm worried about
getting enough meat in

22:06.167 --> 22:08.400
'cause I will be below zero,
four weeks from now.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.867
NARRATOR: Sue's on the hunt
for caribou.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.233
But in the wide open field
of the tundra,

22:22.267 --> 22:24.167
she's got to get close
and stay hidden

22:24.200 --> 22:25.533
or lose her shot.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.867
If you look,
of the six that are there,

22:30.767 --> 22:32.267
you can only see
one-and-a-half.

22:33.567 --> 22:34.733
If you can't see them,

22:35.433 --> 22:37.300
they can't see you.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.800
So I'm trying to use
the topography of the area
in my favour.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.400
But, as you see,
it's not like I have a forest
to hide behind.

22:43.433 --> 22:46.167
So I have to use
what nature gives me.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.633
Sometimes it's just
a four-foot elevation change.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.433
I'm about to
lose my cover.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.800
Dirty, rotten, prick bastards.

23:07.633 --> 23:09.233
They know something's up, man.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.500
Ah, come on, come on, come on.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.700
(SIGHS)

23:18.733 --> 23:20.533
(WHISPERING)
It looks closer than it is.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.033
It's 100, 150
to maybe 200 yards.

23:24.733 --> 23:25.967
This guy's curious.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
(GUNSHOT)

23:48.600 --> 23:49.967
(RELOADING)

23:52.433 --> 23:53.900
I spined him.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.533
Okay, go down, stay down.

24:00.367 --> 24:01.367
(GUNSHOT)

24:03.067 --> 24:04.933
-There's one down.
-(RELOADING)

24:06.200 --> 24:08.033
I got one down over here.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.767
I got some more standing here.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.900
I'm allowed five caribou
for a whole year.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.800
Stop.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.133
Broadside me.

24:38.067 --> 24:39.467
-Really?
-(LOADING)

24:42.533 --> 24:43.600
They clipped a weed.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.467
Willow brush.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.433
I've got a few more
running here.

24:50.033 --> 24:51.367
But they're running.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.600
We'll just go retrieve now.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.033
Let's go see what I got.

24:55.567 --> 24:56.800
All right, little caribou.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.933
Well, I got him.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.033
It's a little bull.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.067
So, he'll be
a tasty little meat bull.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.933
This animal
gave up its life so that I,

25:08.967 --> 25:10.800
you know, can eat this winter.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.567
It's a harsh environment.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.033
But I appreciate
every single life that I take.

25:15.067 --> 25:16.200
Gives me life.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.167
So I say thank you.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.467
Time to get him done, though.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.233
I'm gonna walk back here

25:23.267 --> 25:25.133
and, uh, get the four-wheeler.

25:25.167 --> 25:27.333
Get my knives.
Get them set up.

25:27.367 --> 25:29.233
Cut them up.
Get him in the bag.
Get him cooled down.

25:29.267 --> 25:31.700
He's number one.
I got four to go.

25:31.733 --> 25:34.333
Yeah, I could have hung out
and tried to get
the other little dudes.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.567
But, uh, let's take care of
what I got first.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.633
Get that taken care of,
and then see
what else is out there.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.500
Winter's gonna
come in with a roar

25:41.533 --> 25:42.933
and I need to be
ready for that.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.367
CHIP: This is the life
that happened to me.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.467
I guess you could say
I chose it.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.400
But, um, I didn't come here
with a plan.

25:49.433 --> 25:51.900
I didn't have any idea
I was going to
ever live like this.

25:51.933 --> 25:53.767
But me living like this
makes sense.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.167
AGNES: I wish I could
find the bones

26:06.200 --> 26:08.100
so I can be a happy
little Eskimo.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.600
Come on saber tooth.

26:10.633 --> 26:12.200
Come on dire wolf.

26:12.233 --> 26:13.733
Come on T-Rex. (CHUCKLES)

26:14.633 --> 26:16.500
Smells nasty up here.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.567
I almost want to barf.

26:20.533 --> 26:21.533
(GASPS)

26:25.800 --> 26:28.567
Oh, look at the size of
these bear tracks.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.900
CHIP: Isn't that crazy?

26:31.233 --> 26:32.433
AGNES: Look like, uh...

26:32.467 --> 26:34.167
-CHIP: Brown bear.
-Big one and a small one.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
(GRUNTS)

26:37.400 --> 26:38.867
Another nice leg bone.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.467
Getting closer and closer
to something.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.433
AGNES: Mammoth bone, or what?

26:46.467 --> 26:48.267
I'm not sure.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.567
CHIP: We got a nice mammoth,
look like an ulna radius.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.033
A bison leg
or maybe a horse leg,
and then we got...

26:54.067 --> 26:55.433
That's a front leg
from a caribou.

26:55.467 --> 26:57.067
Let's move on
to the next spot.

26:57.100 --> 27:00.700
NARRATOR: These small fossils
will bring the Hailstones
some extra cash.

27:00.733 --> 27:03.333
But they'll need
a more substantial find
to get the most

27:03.367 --> 27:05.467
out of the time and fuel
they're burning.

27:06.467 --> 27:07.600
(EXCLAIMS)

27:09.033 --> 27:10.667
Oh, look at that deep crack.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.100
It's clay.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.900
It's real clay.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.767
-Let's get by, huh?
-Yeah.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.700
It's going back
a long way, too.

27:20.733 --> 27:22.000
AGNES: Fuck that.

27:24.433 --> 27:25.867
Hey, I see a bone.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.167
AGNES: You see a bone?

27:27.200 --> 27:28.333
A little bone.

27:28.367 --> 27:29.767
Oh, you found a bone!

27:29.800 --> 27:32.800
-It looks like
a bear forearm, huh?
-Yeah.

27:32.833 --> 27:34.967
No, it's too short
to be a bear's forearm.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.733
It's a little too stout
to be a reindeer or a caribou.

27:37.767 --> 27:40.300
-Maybe a pony.
-Maybe a pony. Yeah.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.467
Oh, another chunk of bone.
Bigger!

27:42.500 --> 27:46.433
I wonder if we can find,
like, a horse's skull
or something here, maybe.

27:46.467 --> 27:49.533
Me, I'm just scooting along,
watching the beach for

27:49.567 --> 27:51.800
any kind of bones
sticking out of the water

27:51.833 --> 27:55.333
or making sure
I have him in view, and...

27:56.267 --> 27:58.233
My son is over there.
He's catching up.

27:58.267 --> 27:59.633
But he's going to the top.

28:01.167 --> 28:03.800
We found quite a few
different things...

28:03.833 --> 28:06.667
Here and there...
all along this area.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.000
Every year is different.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.400
Sometimes,
you don't find hardly any.

28:10.433 --> 28:13.233
And sometimes, you just find
all the femur bones.
(CHUCKLES)

28:13.267 --> 28:15.000
-Come!
-(CHIP CACKLES)

28:16.333 --> 28:18.967
-This is awesome.
-Son, your dad
found something.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.533
Mother-fuckers!

28:21.567 --> 28:24.400
Come on, Agnes,
get the fuck over here.

28:24.433 --> 28:27.100
You've never seen
a leg bone saying, "Take me"

28:27.133 --> 28:28.667
like this one does.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.133
AGNES: Holy shit!

28:30.167 --> 28:31.967
CHIP:
That's fucking crazy, huh?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.533
Oh, my goodness.

28:33.567 --> 28:34.767
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

28:34.800 --> 28:36.767
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)
From up there I think, too.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.067
That's a good, big,
solid piece.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.667
That's what we're looking for.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.400
I take my time
and I put, like,

28:44.433 --> 28:46.400
a month into something
like this.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.267
And then I just get
real detail

28:48.300 --> 28:51.733
and make it into
a person standing up
or something.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.267
And then, a couple of grand.
Couple of few grand.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.533
Depending on who
I'm selling it to.

28:56.567 --> 28:58.233
When you start to find
things like this

28:58.267 --> 29:00.533
after you walk for a few hours

29:00.567 --> 29:01.667
it makes you feel better

29:01.700 --> 29:03.433
and you know there's
something really out there,

29:03.467 --> 29:04.867
so you just keep walking.

29:05.767 --> 29:06.967
Mom!

29:07.000 --> 29:08.700
I've got a piece of mammoth
over here.

29:08.733 --> 29:10.700
CHIP: There be mammoth tusks
in these here hills.

29:10.733 --> 29:14.233
We were at three-fourths
the way up
and you can just barely see

29:14.267 --> 29:17.067
the edge of this tusk
sticking out right here.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.733
I'm gonna get a shovel
and a couple of tools
and dig it out.

29:19.767 --> 29:20.867
Definitely mammoth ivory.

29:20.900 --> 29:23.133
You can tell from the colours
and the...

29:23.167 --> 29:24.733
The way it's set right now.

29:25.367 --> 29:26.933
Holy shit and to hell.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.667
Awesomeness.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.633
We're looking
at a bull tusk here.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.633
And it looks like, um,
it's been sitting here so long

29:32.667 --> 29:34.833
it's got green moss
growing on it.

29:34.867 --> 29:36.533
So it might just be
a little piece.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.733
It might be
a foot and half long.
We don't know.

29:38.767 --> 29:40.200
Might be the whole tusk.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.300
It might be both sides
if we keep digging!

29:42.333 --> 29:43.367
I knew there was
something up here.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.633
I could just smell it.

29:45.567 --> 29:47.933
Yeah, let's hope
it's long, huh?

29:47.967 --> 29:50.933
-It looks the butt end.
-Yeah, butt end.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.300
Butt end!

29:53.333 --> 29:55.367
You never know
until you pull them out,
how long they really are.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.467
Yep.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.900
It looks like
it's all broken up all ready.

29:57.933 --> 30:00.067
Yeah, looks like
it's permafrosted up.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.700
It's kind of busted up,

30:01.733 --> 30:04.633
so you can look at
all the grass and the moss
that's growing on it.

30:04.667 --> 30:07.133
-This thing has been...
-Oh, I moved the whole thing.

30:07.167 --> 30:08.433
Yep, here it goes.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.167
This thing's been here
quite a while.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.500
-I didn't mean to...
-It's starting to come apart.

30:12.533 --> 30:15.367
But these small pieces
can be made
into jewellery easily.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.567
Oh, you gotta dig.

30:19.600 --> 30:23.300
This one here looks like
it's been exposed
for quite a while.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.733
CHIP: It's still valuable
to making inlays.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.433
They make scrimshaws.

30:27.467 --> 30:31.267
They make little utensils,
little spoons and hands
and little carvings.

30:31.300 --> 30:36.300
And, um, a mammoth ivory
is beyond 1971.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.900
And since she's uh...

30:37.933 --> 30:40.167
They're both members
of the corporation
that owns this land,

30:40.200 --> 30:41.500
this is their land, too.

30:41.533 --> 30:44.200
And they're legally
allowed to gather
these kind of things.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.733
-Oh, fuck!
-You didn't cut him.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.333
-I didn't mean to do that.
-There's no blood.

30:48.367 --> 30:50.400
This can turn into
a nice little chunk of change.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.900
I'm not sure what it will
turn into until we cure it up

30:52.933 --> 30:55.767
and we dry it out,
and clean it off
and see what we got.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.133
(SNIFFS) Smells like mammoth.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.233
I would say you guys got
a good score there,

31:01.267 --> 31:03.100
especially if you guys
make it into jewellery.

31:03.133 --> 31:06.733
I'd say we can easily make
a couple thousand bucks
out of this stuff.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.700
GLENN: But there was
a period in my life

31:10.733 --> 31:13.067
when I got very interested
in travelling

31:13.100 --> 31:15.833
and most of the places
where I travelled were cities.

31:15.867 --> 31:17.233
But there was still
this part of me

31:17.267 --> 31:19.000
that was really interested
in nature.

31:34.233 --> 31:35.733
I need to fix up my sod house
right now.

31:35.767 --> 31:37.033
I got the sod.

31:37.067 --> 31:39.433
I got a couple holes
in the house
I'm gonna patch up,

31:39.467 --> 31:41.200
and then the sod house
will be in good shape

31:41.233 --> 31:42.667
when I get here next fall.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.000
NARRATOR: Glenn will soon
leave his camp for Fairbanks

31:45.033 --> 31:46.600
where he'll spend
the rest of his summer

31:46.633 --> 31:48.067
with his family and friends.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.100
I might be able to tear
some pieces off

31:50.133 --> 31:51.600
without even using my axe.

31:53.233 --> 31:55.300
Here's a place
where the sod slid down.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.933
I use this sod house
mostly for storing meat,

31:59.967 --> 32:02.200
and in the fall,
I'll be hunting for moose

32:02.233 --> 32:03.933
that will get me
through the winter.

32:03.967 --> 32:06.200
I'll probably be putting
the moose in this sod house

32:06.233 --> 32:08.767
because in the sod house
the birds can't get to it.

32:11.467 --> 32:13.200
That's how I use the sod house
in the fall.

32:13.233 --> 32:15.933
In the spring,
I use the sod house
to keep meat cool,

32:15.967 --> 32:17.333
when it would be
too warm outside

32:17.367 --> 32:18.533
to keep meat any more.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.700
Okay, that's all patched up.

32:24.733 --> 32:26.433
This side here

32:26.467 --> 32:29.033
is where a grizzly bear was
trying to get in here one day.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.233
The grizzly bear
was pawing down the sod.

32:33.267 --> 32:35.167
And I patched it up
a little bit.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.600
But I need to finish that.

32:37.633 --> 32:40.033
I had a moose
in this sod house,

32:40.067 --> 32:43.700
and the bear came along

32:43.733 --> 32:45.533
and tried to get in there
to get that moose meat.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.667
For some reason, he didn't
feel like using the door,

32:49.700 --> 32:52.033
so he started clawing at it
right here.

32:52.067 --> 32:54.633
I was inside,
and I woke up and looked out,

32:54.667 --> 32:56.633
and there was a grizzly bear
right here,

32:56.667 --> 32:58.267
digging into the sod house.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.200
It was dark out.

33:00.233 --> 33:02.067
I could just see him
in the moonlight.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.933
And I asked him to leave,
and he did.

33:04.967 --> 33:06.933
He walked away,
he went up that trail

33:06.967 --> 33:08.467
and growled a little bit.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.167
And then he came back,
so I yelled at him to leave.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.800
"Go away! Get out of here!"

33:12.833 --> 33:17.433
So he walked over there
about 30 yards away
from the camp

33:17.467 --> 33:20.700
and then he turned around
and started walking back
towards me.

33:20.733 --> 33:23.700
And I shot over him,
just to warn him,

33:23.733 --> 33:25.233
and he kept walking
towards me,

33:25.267 --> 33:27.033
so I had to shoot him.

33:27.067 --> 33:30.167
That's the grizzly bear
that I use in there
for bedding.

33:30.200 --> 33:34.767
So, after I shot the bear,
he got to go in the sod house.

33:44.267 --> 33:45.667
Looks pretty good.

33:45.700 --> 33:46.833
I think I'm all done for now.

33:46.867 --> 33:48.400
I'm gonna keep
one piece of sod here

33:48.433 --> 33:50.233
in case bears come
and rip more off.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.500
ANDY: Living out here,
we try and utilise
all resources.

34:02.633 --> 34:05.367
We provide 90%
of our food needs here.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.367
In the combination of hunting,
fishing and gardening.

34:20.633 --> 34:22.533
It's about 10:00 at night,

34:22.567 --> 34:25.433
and I'm hoping that
I can get a net in tonight

34:25.467 --> 34:27.600
and maybe start
catching a few fish.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.867
NARRATOR: Andy's last attempt
with the net failed.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.467
This one has to pay off,

34:31.500 --> 34:34.500
or he could miss
the king salmon run entirely.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.200
King salmon
are the first salmon

34:36.233 --> 34:39.033
to come upriver here,
uh, in the upper Yukon,

34:39.733 --> 34:41.533
and they really...

34:41.567 --> 34:42.833
In the summertime months,

34:42.867 --> 34:45.233
they're the only fish
we really have in the river.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.600
The big problem,
though, is that

34:48.633 --> 34:53.167
this run is less than half
of what it historically is.

34:53.200 --> 34:57.833
And they really need to have
some conservation measures
put on 'em.

34:57.867 --> 35:00.533
That's why I'm out
with this smaller mesh net,

35:00.567 --> 35:03.400
and I'm hoping to catch
almost all males.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.033
If I catch any females,

35:05.067 --> 35:08.200
I'm gonna turn them loose if
they are alive and undamaged.

35:08.233 --> 35:09.967
I'm gonna pull into shore here

35:10.000 --> 35:12.100
and start getting ready
to set a net.

35:14.900 --> 35:18.000
I think what I'm going to do
is just set the anchor and
the line and everything,

35:18.033 --> 35:19.300
and then I'll come
back through

35:19.333 --> 35:23.000
and attach the net to it
after I get the anchor
and the line out.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.500
I gotta get out there
quite a ways.

35:25.533 --> 35:29.000
Okay, that's gonna go
on my anchor.

35:29.033 --> 35:31.267
The end of that
goes to the float.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.100
So, we'll give this a shot
and see how it goes.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.633
I like working alone,

35:42.667 --> 35:44.667
and I always have
and I always will.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.500
I can go at my own pace,

35:47.533 --> 35:50.667
and I don't feel like I have
to keep someone else busy.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.800
And that works just fine
for me.

35:52.833 --> 35:55.067
Sometimes it's more useful
to have hands on deck,

35:55.100 --> 35:57.367
but they better know
what the hell they're doing.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.700
(CHUCKLES) Otherwise,
they're not a help.

35:59.733 --> 36:02.200
Yeah, I think that line
will work there.

36:04.367 --> 36:05.767
Out here where the current is,

36:05.800 --> 36:08.400
is where I want
that ball to be so...

36:08.433 --> 36:12.567
I'm gonna extend this out
another 20 yards or so.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.267
For me, about 12 to 15 feet

36:26.300 --> 36:28.900
is gonna be ideal for
fishing with this net.

36:28.933 --> 36:31.633
I think this will eventually
work for me really well.

36:31.667 --> 36:32.767
It's like anything you do.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.600
The first time,
it's kind of a cluster.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.467
The first time you do it.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.900
And then once you do it
a few times,

36:37.933 --> 36:40.300
you figure out what works well
and what doesn't.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.367
All right, I'm gonna
leave it like that.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.700
I can feel it on the bottom.

36:45.733 --> 36:48.833
And I think I'll fish it
like this for a day.

36:48.867 --> 36:51.167
Come back in the morning,
check it out.

36:58.867 --> 37:00.867
Put the net in last night.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.467
I'm gonna go down and see
if we have some salmon

37:03.500 --> 37:06.900
or some sheefish
or white fish or pike.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.800
Hopefully we have
something to cut up

37:08.833 --> 37:10.667
and put on the grill tonight.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.533
Go out and see
what we got here. (SIGHS)

37:16.700 --> 37:18.300
There might be something
right here.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.467
All right, now we got
a couple of kings here.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.967
It looks like
one is still alive here.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.300
We'll see if she's a female
or a male here.

37:28.333 --> 37:32.733
That's a male,
so I'm not too worried
about releasing that one.

37:32.767 --> 37:35.933
Pull this net up on
and try and get him
untangled here.

37:35.967 --> 37:37.367
(GRUNTING)

37:39.267 --> 37:41.167
We got ourselves a nice
king salmon here.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.567
This is going to be
a good eating.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.433
This is a male,
and they get some pretty
gnarly teeth on 'em.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.967
And as they come upriver,
they begin to morph,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.033
and they'll get
really hooked jaws

37:51.067 --> 37:52.633
and a really hooked
beak right here.

37:52.667 --> 37:55.833
Their teeth tend to get
bigger and bigger.

37:55.867 --> 37:57.367
And the way they get
caught in the net,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.333
as you can see,
he swam into the net,

37:59.367 --> 38:00.633
and then when he tried
to back up

38:00.667 --> 38:03.733
his teeth got caught
into this webbing on the net.

38:04.267 --> 38:05.667
It's probably...

38:05.700 --> 38:08.600
I'm guessing that's
a 20-pound fish.

38:08.633 --> 38:10.033
Twenty-two, maybe.

38:10.667 --> 38:11.800
He's still alive.

38:11.833 --> 38:14.300
One of the things I like to do
on these fish

38:14.333 --> 38:16.000
is called gilling them.

38:16.033 --> 38:17.967
So, you take the gills
right here,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.200
you can see this is where
all the blood is.

38:20.233 --> 38:21.700
This is how they breathe.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.267
You tear that gill and
they're gonna bleed out
really quick.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.633
And that really helps a lot.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.267
See how their heart
is pumping this blood out.

38:29.300 --> 38:32.033
That cleans
a lot of that blood
out of the meat,

38:32.067 --> 38:34.700
and it makes it a lot better
for processing it.

38:34.733 --> 38:36.600
The blood is what will spoil
the meat.

38:36.633 --> 38:39.100
So you have to get that out.

38:39.833 --> 38:41.033
Well, we got something.

38:41.067 --> 38:43.233
Feels good
to finally catch a few fish.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.467
-Fishy, fishy, fishy.
-Geez.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.700
BOTH: Oh, wow!

38:55.600 --> 38:56.967
Looking good, boys.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.700
Oh, that is so beautiful.

38:58.733 --> 39:01.267
The king salmon
is the prime salmon in Alaska.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.467
Probably one of the prime
salmon in the world.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
You know, it's a tradition,
you have to kiss the fish

39:05.533 --> 39:07.733
when you eat your
first king salmon.

39:07.767 --> 39:11.400
Let's do your tradition.
A nice, bloody big male.

39:11.433 --> 39:12.967
Kiss the fish.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.667
Oh, there's gonna be
some good eating tonight.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.467
I'm thinking why don't we
strip the big one,

39:18.500 --> 39:21.033
and we'll turn the little guy
into a barbeque tonight.

39:24.233 --> 39:28.800
So what I like to do is
come in behind the head here.

39:28.833 --> 39:32.033
I'm extremely excited
to get back to my home

39:32.067 --> 39:33.967
and tell everybody
what I've done here

39:34.000 --> 39:35.267
and all the things
I've learnt,

39:35.300 --> 39:37.067
and it's just gonna be awesome

39:37.100 --> 39:39.533
to be able to tell everybody
what life's like here.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.767
Hey, Jacquie,
what part do you want?

39:41.800 --> 39:44.567
You want a piece of tail
or a piece of head?

39:44.600 --> 39:46.367
Piece of tail, please.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.700
-Head or tail? This one?
-That's fine. That's fine.

39:48.733 --> 39:50.500
-You want the skin on it?
-Yeah.

39:52.133 --> 39:54.233
-There you go.
First king of the year.
-(GLASSES CLINK)

39:54.267 --> 39:56.300
First king.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.333
Well done.

39:59.333 --> 40:01.967
SUE: My safety depends on
having guns and bullets.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.800
Booyah!

40:04.833 --> 40:07.833
My health, my food
and being alive.

40:07.867 --> 40:10.667
I mean, it's all dependent on
the guns and the bullets.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.800
All right, time to go to work.

40:22.833 --> 40:24.333
I'm gonna skin him.

40:24.367 --> 40:26.033
Quarter him up.
Get what I can.

40:26.067 --> 40:27.933
It is very hard on me,

40:28.967 --> 40:31.867
the whole skinning
and gutting,

40:31.900 --> 40:33.100
'cause your half bent over.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.200
That's hard on the old
bear injury,

40:35.233 --> 40:36.233
and, uh...

40:36.967 --> 40:39.233
My surgery that I just had.

40:39.267 --> 40:41.867
But they're pretty easy
once you get 'em going.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.667
This is a littler guy.

40:44.700 --> 40:48.767
Um, caribou, while their racks
are enormous,

40:49.567 --> 40:50.567
um,

40:51.800 --> 40:52.967
there's not...

40:53.000 --> 40:55.800
You know you might get
a 100-120 pounds, maybe,

40:55.833 --> 40:56.967
out of a big guy.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.567
This little guy here,
I don't know,

40:58.600 --> 40:59.967
probably 70, 80, maybe.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.133
I like the heart.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.967
I don't know,
it's tasty all the way
around, man.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.500
Yummy, yummy meat.

41:19.467 --> 41:22.133
I'm anaemic. It gives me iron.

41:23.533 --> 41:25.067
The game bag.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.167
Most people
want to hang their meat

41:28.200 --> 41:29.567
so that it cools down.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.967
But the bugs.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.033
You've got flies,
mosquitoes, bugs.

41:37.067 --> 41:39.533
They will lay their eggs
on the meat instantly here.

41:39.567 --> 41:41.467
You put it in a game bag,

41:41.500 --> 41:43.967
and the flies and the bugs
can't get at it.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.600
I'm just trying to get
the big pieces off,

41:45.633 --> 41:47.433
and then I'll get to getting
the rest of the meat.

41:47.467 --> 41:49.633
Am I a pro at this? Nope.

41:49.667 --> 41:51.667
Has anyone ever taken
the time to say,

41:51.700 --> 41:53.533
"This is exactly
the right way to do it,

41:53.567 --> 41:55.133
"so you don't
look like a moron?"

41:55.167 --> 41:56.333
No.

41:57.767 --> 42:00.833
See, here's a nice
piece of meat.
It's called the back strap.

42:00.867 --> 42:02.600
Look at that, nice and red.

42:03.467 --> 42:04.667
The Sue-way.

42:04.700 --> 42:06.267
You take a life,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.967
you be respectful about it
and you use that meat.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.667
I mean, yeah, I suppose
I could saw these up

42:11.700 --> 42:13.233
and put them on the barbie,

42:13.267 --> 42:14.833
but I kind of
like the rib meat.

42:14.867 --> 42:19.467
I'll put it in the crock pot
and have sandwich meat
for a week or more.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.267
This is the end of the road
for cutting this guy up.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.967
Um...

42:24.000 --> 42:26.700
Guts are there,
I got the heart
and stuff I wanted.

42:26.733 --> 42:29.800
I have widdled the meat down

42:30.733 --> 42:32.667
to what I feel is really good.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.433
I have been respectful.

42:34.467 --> 42:36.367
I thank the animal
for helping me out.

42:37.967 --> 42:40.167
Excellent day.
Really profitable.
