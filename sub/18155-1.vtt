<i>Saint Francis spent many years
living alone in the woods.</i>

03:07.887 --> 03:11.624
<i>Then one night,
he saw an angel burning in sky.</i>

03:11.724 --> 03:13.892
<i>And when he woke up...</i>

03:14.093 --> 03:16.327
<i>he had stigmata.</i>

03:18.665 --> 03:23.034
<i>But loneliness can do
strange things to the mind.</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:27.507
<i>Eventually he died of an eye condition</i>

03:27.607 --> 03:30.675
<i>that also would have caused psychosis.</i>

03:37.716 --> 03:39.584
Francisca.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.442
Cow eyes are very similar to human eyes.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.247
The construction is almost exactly the same.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.774
The only difference is they're bigger.

04:13.986 --> 04:18.249
In Portugal,
we used to practice surgery on cows.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.918
Here, they practice on people.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.057
This is how they kill it.

05:43.976 --> 05:47.070
- Francisca.
- Francisca?

05:49.582 --> 05:53.744
I was just getting to know
your daughter. I'm Charlie.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.895
Is your husband at home?

06:00.226 --> 06:02.786
He'll be home any second now.

06:03.262 --> 06:06.523
But we're not interested in whatever
you're trying to sell.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.593
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.932
May I come inside for a second?

06:16.342 --> 06:19.469
Just to use the restroom.
It'll only take a second.

06:31.290 --> 06:35.018
You have a lovely home.
Have you lived here a long time?

06:35.294 --> 06:39.156
The bathroom is through
the living room to the right.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.827
Thanks.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.297
Is your husband usually late?

06:47.974 --> 06:51.134
You said you expected him here any second.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.841
Bathroom is through the living room,
to your right.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.548
Would you show me?

07:08.861 --> 07:11.688
I think you should show me the way.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.239
Ma'am.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.599
I'm trying to be polite.

07:22.842 --> 07:27.337
Now, we can try this one more time
before I start to become unreasonable.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.617
I am sorry, sir,
but I really need you to leave.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.599
I don't quite know what you're planning.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.852
Hey there, Franny.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.100
I'm gonna need you to sit over there
on that chair and be real quiet.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.426
Can you do that for me?

07:56.342 --> 07:59.445
Now, why don't you be a good host

07:59.545 --> 08:02.439
and show me where that bathroom is?

08:20.599 --> 08:22.859
Well, all right now.

08:24.136 --> 08:26.088
Onwards and upwards.

08:26.188 --> 08:29.159
<i>Reporting from the State Fire
Marshal's Office today,</i>

08:29.259 --> 08:33.996
<i>request for all municipal authorities
to ban the sale of an imported ragdoll,</i>

08:34.096 --> 08:36.232
<i>which has been found to be highly flammable.</i>

08:36.332 --> 08:40.270
<i>State Fire Marshal George Chanovec says
every fire department in the state</i>

08:40.370 --> 08:44.932
<i>has been contacted about it.
The doll stands 15 inches high...</i>

08:45.775 --> 08:50.713
<i>The bodies are stuffed with straw,
and the name A.E. Sutton stamped on the foot.</i>

08:50.813 --> 08:55.376
<i>Fire Marshal says the dolls, which sold
for less than a dollar and for usually...</i>

09:15.304 --> 09:17.464
Where's your mother?

09:18.374 --> 09:20.467
I couldn't leave her.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.841
<i>Why'd you mark the calendar
towards this date?</i>

10:35.484 --> 10:39.112
<i>Look, I want this to happen.
I don't want to see it happen.</i>

10:39.755 --> 10:42.248
<i>It'll be over in a few minutes.</i>

10:44.794 --> 10:46.820
<i>I've got things to do.</i>

10:53.235 --> 10:55.762
<i>Can't see the hanging from here.</i>

10:57.173 --> 10:59.232
<i>Just hear it.</i>

11:01.610 --> 11:03.503
<i>Hear it?</i>

11:04.013 --> 11:07.140
<i>Yeah, hanging sounds
almost as bad as it looks.</i>

11:09.486 --> 11:11.811
<i>Trap door bangs open.</i>

11:12.722 --> 11:15.215
Do you want something to eat?

11:17.259 --> 11:19.229
<i>Probably a few fellows
watching will give a...</i>

11:19.329 --> 11:22.122
- Daddy?
- <i>...hoop or a holler.</i>

11:33.175 --> 11:34.944
<i>Trouble?</i>

11:35.044 --> 11:37.938
<i>I got there too late, they told me.</i>

12:00.603 --> 12:02.996
I need help with your mother.

12:46.949 --> 12:49.643
- <i>Something wrong?</i>
- Franny?

12:50.786 --> 12:52.094
<i>No, it's...</i>

12:52.194 --> 12:55.148
- <i>just that I've never seen a lonesomer town.</i>
- Franny?

12:56.525 --> 12:58.195
<i>Well, it's just that...</i>

12:58.295 --> 13:00.854
Franny!

13:02.397 --> 13:06.626
<i>Not everyone. That calendar there
says someone's been counting the days.</i>

13:06.802 --> 13:08.728
Franny!

13:09.872 --> 13:12.608
Franny!

13:12.708 --> 13:15.112
You will have to take care of this.

13:17.012 --> 13:19.548
Franny!

13:22.418 --> 13:24.820
<i>Me and little Joe found Deuce Martin dead.</i>

13:24.920 --> 13:26.690
- Franny!
- <i>Dead?</i>

13:26.790 --> 13:29.558
Franny! Fran, Fran!

13:29.658 --> 13:32.685
Franny! Franny! Franny! Franny!

14:55.411 --> 14:57.671
What are you doing?

14:59.214 --> 15:01.441
You needed stitches.

15:11.093 --> 15:13.453
Why are you laughing?

15:37.186 --> 15:39.212
Why us?

15:43.892 --> 15:45.985
You let me in.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.092
You've done this before.

16:02.011 --> 16:04.270
Why do you do it?

16:09.952 --> 16:12.412
It feels amazing.

16:15.758 --> 16:18.184
You're gonna kill me, right?

16:23.265 --> 16:25.401
Why would I kill you?

16:25.501 --> 16:27.727
You're my only friend.

16:34.810 --> 16:37.370
I'm gonna take care of you.

16:38.847 --> 16:41.107
What are you doing?

17:45.547 --> 17:47.484
<i>Been eating this kind of food
all the way from Ohio?</i>

17:47.584 --> 17:48.606
<i>We have, sir.</i>

17:48.706 --> 17:51.987
<i>Well, you keep shoveling it out to him,
you're not gonna have any left.</i>

17:52.487 --> 17:53.790
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

17:53.890 --> 17:56.459
<i>We hope to be in Slatersville by week's end.</i>

17:56.559 --> 17:59.795
<i>Heard word of a large fertile valley there.</i>

17:59.895 --> 18:03.756
<i>And God willing,
we hope to buy land and settle in peace.</i>

18:04.199 --> 18:06.693
He won't make any more noise.

18:07.136 --> 18:11.141
<i>Yes, and we work for many years
put all of our money together.</i>

18:11.241 --> 18:13.208
I love you, Daddy.

18:13.308 --> 18:17.036
<i>It is our dream to start a fresh new life.</i>

22:07.843 --> 22:09.669
<i>Hello.</i>

22:20.989 --> 22:22.882
Hello.

24:56.477 --> 24:59.114
<i>I told you what I saw at the trial.</i>

24:59.214 --> 25:01.884
- <i>Sally, you lied.</i>
- <i>Little Joe, no need for that.</i>

25:01.984 --> 25:04.276
<i>You were hurting the lady.</i>

25:05.520 --> 25:08.147
<i>I didn't mean to hurt you, Sally, I'm sorry.</i>

25:09.724 --> 25:12.618
<i>I just wanted you
to tell the truth, that's all.</i>

25:16.865 --> 25:20.092
<i>We're not doing any good here.
Let's go see Barney Ogden.</i>

25:20.435 --> 25:21.694
<i>Ma'am.</i>

29:49.270 --> 29:51.663
So, you live close by?

29:52.807 --> 29:55.033
A few towns over.

30:26.808 --> 30:29.402
Your house is so neat.

30:31.679 --> 30:33.772
Thank you.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.811
Can I get you anything?

30:41.956 --> 30:44.049
I'm okay.

30:50.665 --> 30:53.392
Have you lived here a long time?

30:53.701 --> 30:55.861
My whole life.

30:58.006 --> 31:00.332
Was this your parents' house?

31:00.809 --> 31:02.634
Yes.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.073
Do you live here alone now?

31:12.053 --> 31:14.322
I'm sorry, I'm asking so many questions.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.516
I ask a lot of questions when I'm nervous.

31:19.727 --> 31:21.953
Why are you nervous?

31:23.731 --> 31:25.958
I don't do this very often.

31:27.068 --> 31:29.127
Do what?

31:29.871 --> 31:32.097
Go home with people.

31:34.342 --> 31:36.368
Neither do I.

31:37.512 --> 31:41.206
Okay, so we both have
an excuse to be awkward.

32:01.069 --> 32:03.328
Is this your mother?

32:04.305 --> 32:06.031
Yes.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.934
She's beautiful.

32:09.210 --> 32:11.269
She was.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.680
What was she like?

32:26.861 --> 32:29.254
She was a wonderful mother.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.993
What else?

32:36.571 --> 32:38.730
I don't know.

32:42.443 --> 32:44.536
I don't know.

32:47.015 --> 32:50.308
Come on. Anything.

33:01.429 --> 33:03.622
What did she do?

33:05.133 --> 33:08.026
She was a surgeon in Portugal.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.529
What kind?

33:10.638 --> 33:12.594
Eyes.

33:16.344 --> 33:18.329
When I was little,

33:18.429 --> 33:21.423
we used to do the sections together.

33:22.684 --> 33:25.421
I remember I was fascinated

33:25.521 --> 33:29.348
by how the inside of the body looked.

33:30.775 --> 33:34.069
She always hoped
I would be a surgeon one day.

33:41.636 --> 33:44.763
I dissected a cat once in school.

33:48.142 --> 33:51.169
That sort of stuff always grossed me out.

34:20.408 --> 34:22.768
What happened to her?

34:34.288 --> 34:36.281
I'm sorry.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.085
I shouldn't have asked.

34:47.101 --> 34:49.427
Someone killed her.

35:15.496 --> 35:17.389
What?

35:50.164 --> 35:52.457
What about your dad?

36:00.374 --> 36:02.214
I killed him.

36:08.349 --> 36:10.375
No, really.

36:10.518 --> 36:12.344
Really.

36:14.388 --> 36:16.214
What?

36:20.878 --> 36:22.792
You're not serious, are you?

36:29.136 --> 36:30.862
Yeah.

36:31.539 --> 36:33.302
What's wrong?

36:35.409 --> 36:37.235
Nothing.

36:40.414 --> 36:42.240
I'm sorry.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.243
That wasn't funny.

36:45.586 --> 36:47.779
So sorry.

36:49.257 --> 36:52.985
No, I'm... it's okay. I...

36:55.029 --> 36:57.733
I should probably think
about heading home soon.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.902
Why? Please don't go.

37:01.002 --> 37:05.407
- I can just call my mom.
- No. No. I'll drive you home.

37:05.507 --> 37:07.799
No, it's okay.

37:11.511 --> 37:14.502
I'll drive you home.
Please don't go. Please don't go.

37:14.602 --> 37:17.349
No, no, it's... it's okay.

37:17.449 --> 37:20.988
- No.
- I... listen, I'm just kind of tired.

37:21.088 --> 37:23.090
- I'm just gonna go.
- Please.

37:23.190 --> 37:25.446
- I'm... I'm just gonna...
- Don't go.

37:25.546 --> 37:28.063
- I'm gonna go, okay?
- Please, stop.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.085
I'm just a little tired, okay?

50:56.003 --> 50:58.373
It's okay, little guy.

50:59.973 --> 51:02.400
He's just... he's a little fussy.

51:03.977 --> 51:05.812
It's okay.

51:05.912 --> 51:08.572
Would you mind putting that
back in his mouth?

51:09.549 --> 51:11.575
Thank you.

51:19.927 --> 51:22.029
Baby.

51:22.129 --> 51:24.355
Don't cry.

51:37.244 --> 51:39.704
So, you're just up this way, right?

51:41.113 --> 51:42.873
Yes.

51:43.917 --> 51:45.496
Okay.

51:46.453 --> 51:48.757
Have a wonderful afternoon, okay?

51:49.157 --> 51:51.682
You think I could just hold Antonio?

51:52.872 --> 51:55.563
I'm sorry. We... we really have to get going.

51:55.663 --> 51:58.723
Please, can I hold him just for a little bit?

52:01.234 --> 52:03.871
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, just do it quick.

52:03.971 --> 52:06.674
A quick one. Yes, of course.
Of course we can.

52:06.774 --> 52:10.277
- Hey, baby.
- Come on, little guy.

52:10.777 --> 52:15.315
Yeah, we made a new friend today.
Look at that. She's just gonna hold you.

52:17.418 --> 52:19.910
It's okay. It's okay.

52:21.988 --> 52:25.383
Okay, so you just wanna hold his head up.

52:26.593 --> 52:31.665
- Hi, baby. Hello, baby.
- Good job. He likes his little...

52:31.965 --> 52:33.324
His little...

52:37.370 --> 52:39.706
What are you... saying?

52:39.806 --> 52:43.077
What are you doing? No.

52:45.011 --> 52:47.582
No! Stop! Please, don't hurt him, please!

52:47.682 --> 52:50.852
Don't hurt my baby! Stop!
Please don't hurt him!

52:50.952 --> 52:53.377
Please, don't hurt him, please!

53:43.603 --> 53:45.839
Hey, baby.

53:46.139 --> 53:48.799
- Don't scream.
- Please don't do this.

53:53.713 --> 53:55.350
- Please give him back to me.
- Baby.

53:55.450 --> 53:57.842
Please get away from him.

58:11.805 --> 58:13.831
<i>Mr. Loren...</i>

58:13.973 --> 58:16.343
<i>I advise you to call this party off now.</i>

58:16.443 --> 58:19.279
<i>The ghosts are already moving
and that's a bad sign.</i>

58:19.379 --> 58:21.915
<i>Let me apologize for my wife,
she'll join us later.</i>

58:22.015 --> 58:23.686
- <i>What will you have?</i>
- <i>Scotch Ann.</i>

58:23.786 --> 58:26.377
- <i>Doctor?</i>
- <i>I'll have the same.</i>

58:26.719 --> 58:31.458
<i>Now, before the party begins,
let's go over the details.</i>

58:31.558 --> 58:34.895
<i>The caretakers will leave at midnight
locking us in here</i>

58:34.995 --> 58:37.863
<i>until they come back in the morning.</i>

58:37.963 --> 58:41.068
<i>Once the door is locked, there's no way out.</i>

58:41.168 --> 58:43.771
<i>The windows have bars
that a jail would be proud of.</i>

58:43.871 --> 58:47.441
- Antonio?
- <i>Now, the only door to the outside...</i>

58:48.441 --> 58:51.544
<i>There's no electricity, no phone.</i>

58:51.644 --> 58:53.913
<i>No one within miles.</i>

58:54.013 --> 58:55.990
<i>So, no way to call for help.</i>

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:52.843
It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
It's only a dream. It's only a dream.

01:01:53.926 --> 01:01:55.819
What?

01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:03.260
Did you go in the barn?

01:02:11.844 --> 01:02:14.905
I told you to never go in the barn.

01:11:38.677 --> 01:11:40.777
Baby! Baby, wake up. Baby.

01:11:40.877 --> 01:11:42.749
- What's wrong?
- You know how much I love you, right?

01:11:42.849 --> 01:11:45.018
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong.

01:11:45.118 --> 01:11:48.255
Whatever you learn, don't let it change
how I feel about me, okay?

01:11:48.355 --> 01:11:51.891
- Who's here?
- Open up. Open up, it's the police.

01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:53.842
Police!

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:57.264
Come on, come on, baby. Come on. You're fast.

01:11:57.364 --> 01:12:01.324
- Come on. Come on.
- Clear! Get them clear. Backup, upstairs.

01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.581
- Upstairs.
- Second floor. Let's go.

01:12:15.815 --> 01:12:17.573
Mommy!
