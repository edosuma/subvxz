WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:07.541
Excuse me.
Um... what's going on?

00:07.541 --> 00:10.378
The landlord smelled something
coming out of 6-B.

00:10.378 --> 00:13.114
He went in and found a body.

00:23.557 --> 00:27.195
Hi. Um, I'm friends
with the woman in 6-B.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.198
Can I--
Can I please come in?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.732
Yeah, sure.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.033
- Come on.
- Thank you.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.907
He says he knows her.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.778
- What's your name?
- Adam Carpenter.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.580
What's the nature
of your relationship

00:46.580 --> 00:48.015
to the deceased?

00:48.015 --> 00:50.218
I'm the father of her child.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.786
I'm sorry.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.855
What happened?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.023
No sign of forced entry.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.858
Looks like natural causes.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.693
Can't be sure till
the coroner weighs in.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.263
Did she have any known
medical issues?

01:02.263 --> 01:06.534
Uh, her prenatal doc said
she had a low

01:06.534 --> 01:08.035
red blood cell count,
but that it wasn't

01:08.035 --> 01:10.238
anything to be worried about.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.873
Give me a call in the morning.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.642
We'll take your full statement.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.584
Can I have a...
a minute in here?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.253
Take your time.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.371
<i>The lab received a strange call</i>

02:17.371 --> 02:19.540
<i>from the Fire Island
Park Service this morning.</i>

02:19.540 --> 02:21.975
<i>The rangers can't explain
how the deer</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:24.278
<i>are repopulating
so quickly there</i>

02:24.278 --> 02:26.547
<i>despite the culling
earlier this summer.</i>

02:26.547 --> 02:28.682
<i>I confess I can't
explain it either.</i>

03:46.794 --> 03:48.796
<i>The lab received a strange call</i>

03:48.796 --> 03:51.131
<i>from the Fire Island
Park Service this morning.</i>

03:51.131 --> 03:53.401
<i>The rangers can't explain
how the deer are</i>

03:53.401 --> 03:55.369
<i>repopulating so quickly there</i>

03:55.369 --> 03:57.638
<i>despite the culling
earlier this summer.</i>

03:57.638 --> 04:00.107
<i>I confess, I can't
explain it either.</i>

04:05.178 --> 04:07.915
<i>A virus?
But how does it replicate?</i>

04:09.550 --> 04:12.219
<i>Dr. Gallo's report
on T-cell lymphoma</i>

04:12.219 --> 04:14.288
<i>makes me suspect
that it could be...</i>

04:33.941 --> 04:35.976
<i>Dr. Gallo's report
on T-cell lymphoma</i>

04:35.976 --> 04:37.845
<i>makes me suspect
that it could be...</i>

05:06.507 --> 05:08.876
No way to be certain,
but my best guess

05:08.876 --> 05:10.544
would be heart failure.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.280
Sudden, bolt-of-lightning
heart failure.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.349
I'll know more
when I get to her,

05:15.349 --> 05:17.518
- probably tomorrow.
- What about homicide?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.319
I'm sorry?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.955
- What if she was attacked?
- Attacked?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.558
Yes. Play it again.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.326
I don't need to.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.463
There are zero signs of
a struggle on her body.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.999
And I'm so sorry, but if you
suspect something like this,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.367
why wouldn't you bring that
to the police?

05:33.367 --> 05:34.535
I have my reasons.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.036
Well, you're giving me reasons
to make

05:36.036 --> 05:37.337
an official report of this

05:37.337 --> 05:38.972
and have you brought in
for questioning.

05:38.972 --> 05:43.644
I agreed to this
as a favor to Patrick.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.379
He said you needed some closure
on what happened

05:45.379 --> 05:46.680
to your friend Theo.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.018
Look, Adam, there is no way

05:51.018 --> 05:53.887
that these two cases
are related.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.223
I can get you more information

05:56.223 --> 05:58.426
on Dr. Wells' body
when I have it.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.429
But your friend Mr. Graves...

06:01.429 --> 06:03.897
no sign of struggle either.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.400
He had pneumocystis pneumonia.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.170
Undiagnosed, untreated
and aggressive.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.606
That was the primary factor
in his death.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.708
What is that?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.544
It's a lung infection.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.779
It's caused by a fungus.

06:18.779 --> 06:22.082
Usually affects older patients
who have weak immune systems.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.584
Then how would it kill him
that quickly?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.786
The report says that
he'd been tied up

06:25.786 --> 06:28.388
crucifixion style.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.292
He was hanging by his arms
for what, hours probably?

06:32.292 --> 06:35.095
That's what deprived him
of oxygen.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.697
That combined with
the pneumonia,

06:36.697 --> 06:39.232
he didn't have a chance.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.770
Plus, toxicology found quaaludes
in his system.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.038
Those would have depressed
his breathing to begin with.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.941
Made it difficult
for him to struggle or gasp

06:47.941 --> 06:50.778
or whatever he would need...

06:54.014 --> 06:58.719
And listen, that means
Theo didn't suffer,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.153
if that helps you.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.490
So the cause of death
was, uh...

07:02.490 --> 07:03.924
Suffocation.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.295
I know what you're trying
to get me to say

07:08.295 --> 07:10.831
because it feels like
it would make more sense,

07:10.831 --> 07:12.099
but I can't get there.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.502
There's no proof
of foul play, Adam.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.970
Nobody was attacked.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.574
The tragedy is that two lives
ended far too soon.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.610
I'm truly sorry
for your loss,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.645
but I don't see how
these two cases are related

07:24.645 --> 07:26.313
in any way.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.582
I don't know how
anybody else will, either.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.885
Uh, thank you.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.295
<i>June 27, 1981.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:43.764
<i>Seven months ago.</i>

07:43.764 --> 07:46.466
<i>I asked Adam
to get me pregnant.</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:49.036
<i>I used a turkey baster
with his semen in it</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:51.104
<i>to conceive this child.</i>

07:51.104 --> 07:53.373
<i>A direct route of transmission.</i>

07:53.373 --> 07:56.710
<i>And the timeline is
making sense.</i>

07:56.710 --> 07:59.547
<i>I say this because
it's definitive.</i>

07:59.547 --> 08:01.615
<i>My lab results are
mirroring Adam's</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:03.617
<i>and those of my other
gay patients.</i>

08:18.131 --> 08:20.901
<i>It's a development
that leads me to suspect</i>

08:20.901 --> 08:23.036
<i>that this disease could be
sexually transmitted.</i>

08:30.911 --> 08:33.246
<i>I know he suspects that
something is wrong,</i>

08:33.246 --> 08:35.683
<i>but he couldn't know
how sick we all are.</i>

08:38.318 --> 08:41.054
<i>Our defenses are down,
our bodies are under attack.</i>

08:45.492 --> 08:49.597
<i>Adam.</i>

08:49.597 --> 08:52.099
<i>How am I gonna tell him?</i>

09:13.286 --> 09:15.088
<i>Fungi and bacteria
run rampant and unchecked.</i>

09:15.088 --> 09:16.890
<i>Opportunistic infection.</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:18.091
<i>Pneumocystis pneumonia.</i>

09:18.091 --> 09:20.360
<i>Kaposi's Sarcoma.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:22.529
<i>I need to tell Adam
as soon as he gets back.</i>

09:22.529 --> 09:25.098
<i>I need to tell him
all of this tomorrow.</i>

09:43.684 --> 09:45.118
Okay, there...

09:49.422 --> 09:53.060
Results will take between
seven to ten days.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.895
I can have the front desk
call you

09:54.895 --> 09:56.897
to set up a follow-up
appointment.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.499
I already know what it is.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.802
I just need you to confirm it
for your records.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.537
Oh, really?
And what is that?

10:06.506 --> 10:08.942
Kaposi's Sarcoma.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.312
Doctor? Sorry.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.014
I have-- I have reason
to believe

10:14.014 --> 10:16.316
that this is sexually transmitted.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.119
Adam, you're a young man.
It's probably benign.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.088
There's no reason to panic.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.356
No, I... I need you to
listen to me.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.458
Um, there's something new
out there,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.695
and-and you need to be
putting every colleague,

10:27.695 --> 10:29.162
every medical body
in New York

10:29.162 --> 10:30.764
on high alert.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.632
How do you expect me
to get anyone

10:32.632 --> 10:35.703
to take what you've just said
seriously, exactly?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.470
On your say-so.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.106
I don't expect you to,

10:39.106 --> 10:41.975
but you will have my results
in seven to ten days,

10:41.975 --> 10:45.345
and then maybe you can
take me seriously.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.986
<i>June 2, 1981.</i>

10:52.986 --> 10:54.621
<i>More tests came back today.</i>

10:54.621 --> 10:57.324
<i>The deer on Fire Island
are not the origin.</i>

10:57.324 --> 11:00.360
<i>It makes me wonder if this
Fran woman is on to something.</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:03.864
<i>Did all this begin
with a lab leak?</i>

11:03.864 --> 11:06.533
<i>I was able to confirm that
some of what she said about</i>

11:06.533 --> 11:09.502
<i>the government experiments
on Plum Island is true.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:12.405
<i>But weaponized ticks?</i>

11:12.405 --> 11:15.642
<i>It feels absurd even
entertaining this possibility.</i>

11:15.642 --> 11:18.011
<i>But many of the rashes
and fevers in my patients</i>

11:18.011 --> 11:21.381
<i>match a cluster of cases
in Lyme, Connecticut.</i>

11:21.381 --> 11:23.583
<i>And now Rocky Mountain Labs
wants us to send them</i>

11:23.583 --> 11:26.353
<i>tick samples from
all over Long Island.</i>

11:26.353 --> 11:28.989
<i>They suspect that deer ticks
are the actual carriers</i>

11:28.989 --> 11:31.859
<i>of this, quote,
"Lyme Disease."</i>

11:31.859 --> 11:34.194
<i>But what about my gay patients
with these changes</i>

11:34.194 --> 11:35.829
<i>in immune function?</i>

11:35.829 --> 11:37.998
<i>Similar reports
of rashes and fever</i>

11:37.998 --> 11:39.833
<i>shortly after trips
to Fire Island.</i>

11:39.833 --> 11:43.937
<i>From weaponized ticks?
It doesn't seem right.</i>

11:43.937 --> 11:46.539
<i>Simplistic. Far-fetched.</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:49.242
<i>What's more likely is that
I'm observing the effects</i>

11:49.242 --> 11:51.511
<i>of an entirely new pathogen.</i>

11:51.511 --> 11:53.080
<i>It was bound to happen.</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:54.647
<i>It could have come
from anywhere.</i>

12:07.260 --> 12:09.262
<i>Wherever it came from,
I'm having trouble</i>

12:09.262 --> 12:11.799
<i>getting my work
any serious attention.</i>

12:11.799 --> 12:14.201
<i>The neglect faced by
this community is criminal.</i>

12:14.201 --> 12:16.904
<i>Surely others have noticed
something by now.</i>

12:16.904 --> 12:18.505
<i>I have to make more noise.</i>

12:26.113 --> 12:28.248
If you're looking
for an autograph,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.317
you'll have to wait
till after the show.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.252
Uh, I'm-I'm not here
for an autograph.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.588
Um, it's a matter
of public health.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.457
Really?

12:37.457 --> 12:40.427
Well, it's very kind of you
to finally show up.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.761
Sorry?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.564
I've been calling
you guys for weeks.

12:44.564 --> 12:48.235
We've been bleaching,
scrubbing with ethyl alcohol,

12:48.235 --> 12:49.970
following every protocol
to the T, and still,

12:49.970 --> 12:52.272
my patrons are getting sick.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.740
Where the hell have you been?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.143
I'm, uh, I'm not here
from the Health Department.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.412
I'm just a concerned citizen.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.883
Um, I was hoping
you could post these.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.922
I brought some boxes of condoms
in here, too.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.490
Boxes?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.860
Yeah. The checkout lady
looked at me

13:12.860 --> 13:15.295
like I was
the Whore of Babylon.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.198
There's something new
going around.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.501
Something deadly.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.336
I'm just trying to keep
as many people safe as I can.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.375
It's my last show tonight.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.578
And it doesn't feel safe
around here anymore.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.184
- Last show?
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.219
End of an era.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.058
I should have hung
my tiara up years ago.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.895
But I'm stubborn.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.997
Holding on to an old dream.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.066
But what a dream it was.

13:53.066 --> 13:57.704
All that music, all that love.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.806
Freedom incarnate.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.342
Vitality without shame.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.413
But it's gone now.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.182
I've sensed it coming
for a long time.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.585
It's over.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.361
Deadly, huh?

14:25.432 --> 14:29.502
Well, go with God,

14:29.502 --> 14:32.672
whatever that means to you.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.908
I'm closing shop.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.613
Now, listen, kid,

14:40.613 --> 14:43.450
you are way too young
to be thinking about

14:43.450 --> 14:45.518
how not to die.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.289
Don't forget how to live.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.823
I told you.

15:56.823 --> 16:01.194
I told you, I told you.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.371
I told you.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.676
Next.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.213
Sir, he just said
you're next.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.813
Mrs. Read, uh,
Patrick would have...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.461
Aye-yi-yi. Gladiola.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.277
No, no, no, no, goddamn it!

19:04.277 --> 19:06.646
This is supposed to be open,
goddamn it!

19:08.181 --> 19:10.450
We want people to face
what happened to you.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.852
Why did you do this?

19:12.852 --> 19:16.189
Patrick. Patrick.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.624
