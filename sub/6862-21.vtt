WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:04.172
What if we tore down
that wall over there?
For special events.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.606
I mean, how hard is it
to take down a wall?

00:08.276 --> 00:09.443
How much is
this gonna cost?

00:09.477 --> 00:11.612
Well, more than
we made tonight.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.083
BRICK:
If there's someone that you
care about in this world,

00:15.116 --> 00:17.651
the risk lies
in not letting them know

00:17.685 --> 00:19.153
while you have the chance.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.154
Shelby,

00:20.188 --> 00:21.722
will you marry me?

00:21.755 --> 00:22.856
Yes?

00:22.890 --> 00:25.126
I almost choked to death
the other day on a donut hole,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.460
which is why I'm
here, to tell you

00:26.494 --> 00:27.828
I like you.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.163
Actually, I'm pretty
sure that you are

00:29.197 --> 00:30.098
the one for me and...

00:30.131 --> 00:31.765
Are you out of
your freaking mind right now?!

00:31.799 --> 00:33.567
I am sorry
you almost choked

00:33.601 --> 00:35.369
to death
with a head full of regrets,

00:35.403 --> 00:38.772
but next time,
take smaller bites.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.149
ZOE (in Russian accent):
Hello, I am vodka.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.617
(sultry voice):
Hello, vodka.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.819
I'm coffee liqueur. Mwah.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.488
Okay, uh, this is weird.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.090
It's like an episode
of Sesame Street

00:56.124 --> 00:57.758
they decided to never air.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.494
(chuckles)
These are the ingredients

01:00.528 --> 01:02.296
for a mind eraser drink

01:02.330 --> 01:04.697
that the Internet guarantees
will erase

01:04.732 --> 01:07.268
your brain of
anything stupid

01:07.301 --> 01:09.137
you might have
done last night

01:09.170 --> 01:10.404
or anything you
might have said

01:10.438 --> 01:12.140
that you very,
very much regret.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.507
Yeah, Zoe,
what the hell

01:13.541 --> 01:15.443
was that last night?

01:15.476 --> 01:16.577
I mean, I'm with Tansy now.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.645
We have been over...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.213
Over this.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.781
I know. I am so sorry.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.316
It was a crazy
thing to do.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.185
I've been a little crazy lately.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.319
You're a lawyer.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.654
You've heard
of the insanity defense.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.723
Yeah, but those people still
get locked up.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.825
Zoe, I just need to know
that this is not

01:31.859 --> 01:34.828
gonna be a nightly occurrence,
okay?

01:34.862 --> 01:36.830
No, one time thing, I swear.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.766
Well, that's also what the guy
across the river says

01:38.799 --> 01:41.735
about letting his dog out
at obscene hours of the evening,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.637
but still, every night
at 2:30 a.m.,

01:43.671 --> 01:46.874
I hear, "Go potty. Go potty.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.209
Go potty."

01:48.242 --> 01:49.377
I promise.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.612
Look, I never should have
brought my craziness to you.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.614
I felt so bad that I
didn't sleep all night.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.317
While I wasn't sleeping,
I had a revelation,

01:56.350 --> 01:58.586
and I started
an online dating profile.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.288
You're online dating now?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.755
Yup, moving on.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.357
Fishing in a whole new pond.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.426
The dating world no longer
knows me as Dr. Zoe Hart.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.628
I am my screen name,
LetsGetAPhysical.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.232
Oh.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.702
Yeah, it seemed better
at 4:00 a.m.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.706
Daddy, I really have
a lot going on here.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.808
Can't you just tell me
over the phone?

02:20.841 --> 02:23.244
Okay, okay, I'll be right over.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.612
All right.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.514
Um, I have to run
to see my father.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.781
Can you fix the damage?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.183
Of course
he can fix the damage.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.185
And so can I,
like I told you.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.853
Yeah, it's not
the damage

02:32.886 --> 02:34.555
you can see
that's a problem, miss.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.389
You see, inside the ceiling,

02:35.423 --> 02:37.591
you got old
knob-and-tube wiring,

02:37.625 --> 02:38.892
areas of dry rot,

02:38.926 --> 02:41.962
a galvanized sprinkler
pipe starting to fail.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.598
It's beyond what your handyman
should be taking on. No offense.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.533
Oh, none taken.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.435
I can hardly understand
all those big words.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.836
(chuckles)
Um,

02:48.869 --> 02:50.404
Wade isn't my handyman.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.206
He's my business partner.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.207
Oh, well, I'm just
gonna go ahead

02:53.241 --> 02:54.742
and work up an estimate
and call you later.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.310
Is this number you
gave me okay to use?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.645
Yeah, it's great.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.680
I-I mean, it's fine.
Mm-hmm.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.886
Now you see why you don't call
a guy like that?

03:05.919 --> 03:09.189
(chuckles)
Not at all.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.628
Hey.
Hey.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.331
I just passed Zoe Hart going
the other way.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.566
Huh.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.801
Oh, it's probably because
she was here.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.771
Okay, and why was she here?

03:23.804 --> 03:26.340
Uh, to... apologize.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.408
For?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.609
Saying that she...

03:28.642 --> 03:32.246
had feelings for me
last night.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.547
Dolly Parton, go inside.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.815
Daddy and I are gonna fight.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.750
(dog grunts)
Okay, look, she came by.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.986
You were out with your brothers,
and she was upset,

03:39.019 --> 03:41.889
and she said the thing,
but then this morning,

03:41.922 --> 03:44.492
and here's the important part,
she apologized.

03:44.525 --> 03:48.262
Said she was way out of line,
and it will never happen again.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.632
And did she say she doesn't
have feelings for you?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.901
I... don't recall that
coming up,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.003
but that doesn't matter because,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.539
and here's
the really important part,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.641
I don't feel the same way,

04:00.674 --> 04:01.975
and she's moving on.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.344
She's online dating.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.346
So see, all in the past.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.616
Also, free vodka.

04:08.649 --> 04:12.052
Okay then.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.455
Okay then.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.923
Bye.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.994
ROSE:
 Thanks for letting me
 raid your closet

04:21.028 --> 04:22.330
for ninth- and
tenth-grade prom.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.631
I just hope it
isn't too painful

04:23.664 --> 04:25.499
for you that I'm going with Max.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.701
I mean, that could have easily
been you on his arm,

04:27.735 --> 04:29.870
but for a small twist of fate.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.005
No, I have put Max
on the pile of old business,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.474
but now thanks
to this dating site,

04:33.507 --> 04:36.510
(computer chimes)
new business is flooding in.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.746
Flooding or oozing?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.481
Okay, maybe
they're not all winners,

04:40.514 --> 04:42.049
but at least I'm out there.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.785
I have to go to a med school
friend's wedding in New York,

04:44.818 --> 04:46.887
so now when people ask me
if I'm seeing anyone,

04:46.920 --> 04:47.788
I don't have to lie.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.957
I can say, "Yes,
his name is RollTide420."

04:51.692 --> 04:52.760
Yikes.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.962
Can I have another run at Max?
No.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.530
You're getting bottom-feeders

04:56.564 --> 04:57.931
because you're fishing
with the wrong bait.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.700
Your profile sucks.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.101
What's wrong with it?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.670
Well, to start,
it's four pages long.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.004
It looks like one
of those manifestos

05:04.037 --> 05:07.475
the FBI finds in serial
killers' apartments.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.643
Hey, you just deleted
the whole fourth grade.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.545
That was a very pivotal time
in my life.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.647
And what is this picture
of you in a lab coat?

05:13.681 --> 05:14.815
It's my hospital ID photo.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.384
I used to get lots
of compliments

05:16.417 --> 05:17.918
from my recovering
surgical patients.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.387
(camera shutter clicks)
Hey!

05:19.420 --> 05:20.654
I don't know much about men,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.055
obviously, but I
bet they'd rather

05:22.089 --> 05:23.491
play doctor than date one.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.592
(computer chimes)

05:24.625 --> 05:25.793
Ha!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.395
Some men like to date doctors.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.496
Look at this.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.097
Banker from Mobile,
plays tennis,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.032
went to Vanderbilt. Score.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.402
Okay, but just in case

05:34.435 --> 05:35.769
you and the banker
don't work out,

05:35.803 --> 05:38.672
I am posting the new
and improved Zoe Hart.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.541
Hey, wait.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.543
When asked what I was
looking for, what did you check?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.911
Relationship or casual sex?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.345
(computer chimes rapidly)

05:47.047 --> 05:50.150
And that answers that.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.053
Well, Daddy, don't leave us
hanging here by our thumbs.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.022
Why'd you want to see us?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.690
Lemon,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.626
Magnolia.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.761
Present.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.130
Girls,

06:03.163 --> 06:06.734
Shelby and I...

06:06.767 --> 06:09.036
are engaged.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.408
SHELBY:
Well, you could at least
fake a congratulations.

06:14.442 --> 06:18.746
I can always make it seem
real later in my head.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.113
When did this happen?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.882
Oh, um,
when I was in the hospital.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.751
What?
What? You were
in the hospital?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.086
Which is also news, I realize.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.755
Okay, why were you
in the hospital?

06:27.788 --> 06:29.623
Just a brain tumor.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.758
You have a brain tumor?

06:30.791 --> 06:31.992
No.
Okay, is this your strategy,

06:32.025 --> 06:33.427
to tell us the worst
thing possible

06:33.461 --> 06:35.028
so this bad news
doesn't seem so bad?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.764
No, no,
I do not have a brain tumor.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.831
If I'd known

06:37.865 --> 06:39.433
you hadn't planned
any of this,

06:39.467 --> 06:40.634
I would've written
something up.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.436
Yeah, but the point is

06:42.470 --> 06:45.205
no tumor, engaged, yay!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.907
Also, just to
clear the air,

06:46.940 --> 06:49.109
I apologized completely

06:49.142 --> 06:50.744
to your father
for running away

06:50.778 --> 06:52.179
when I thought he was dying.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.181
You ran away?

06:54.214 --> 06:56.517
But I understand it,
and it's fine.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.185
She was scared.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.654
It-it was scary,
and we talked about it,

07:00.688 --> 07:03.591
and, uh, oh,
doesn't bother me a bit.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.092
Well, why not? It
should bother you.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.727
It bothers me plenty.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.195
And I said it doesn't.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.931
I have to meet my friends
to shop for the prom,

07:10.964 --> 07:13.166
so if you guys are married
by the time I get back,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.968
save me some cake.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.539
She's a firecracker.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.810
LAVON:
Hey, Wade.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.712
I'm sorry,

07:24.745 --> 07:27.147
but I just got a call from
the county building department

07:27.180 --> 07:28.916
who got word from a contractor.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.018
You're gonna have to shut down
for repairs, man.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.886
Yeah, except I already
did the repairs,

07:32.920 --> 07:33.821
so problem solved.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.889
You know, those government
storm troopers

07:35.923 --> 07:37.024
tried shutting us down
once before

07:37.057 --> 07:38.559
just 'cause I hired
a perfectly nice,

07:38.592 --> 07:40.894
large-breasted,
underage girl to serve alcohol.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.031
It's like we're living
in Pakistan, Lavon, Pakistan.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.266
Carry on.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.135
Huh, yeah.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.105
Tansy, you okay?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.107
Oh, it's...
probably nothing.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.243
Just that Zoe Hart
came over last night

07:56.276 --> 07:57.911
and told George
she had feelings for him.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.580
No.
Yeah,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.049
but George said
she's over it and moving on

08:02.082 --> 08:03.584
and even online dating,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.819
and I know it shouldn't
matter if she has feelings

08:05.853 --> 08:07.888
for George because he doesn't
have feelings for her.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.157
Tansy, you're
probably just insecure

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825
about where you
and George stand.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.595
What you need
is absolute scientific proof

08:14.628 --> 08:16.697
that you two are meant
to be together,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.899
like Tom and me, so even
in the rough times,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.301
you don't worry
how it'll end up.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.637
Well, that sounds nice,
but I can't imagine

08:23.671 --> 08:25.305
how you'd prove that.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.608
Having your star charts done.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.642
Oh, my God, is that a thing?

08:28.676 --> 08:29.810
How does it work?
Where do I go?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.645
Madame Van Horn, here.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.746
(sighs)

08:37.284 --> 08:39.086
Ooh, Internet dating, huh?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.621
Better be careful; a lot
of freaks and weirdos online.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.990
Well, there are plenty

08:43.023 --> 08:44.091
in here, too.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.726
Mm, zing.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.998
Dr. Hart?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.600
Hey, Meatball.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.201
Here I am.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.903
What?

08:55.936 --> 08:56.737
You're the tennis-playing banker

08:56.770 --> 08:58.806
from Mobile
who went to Vanderbilt?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.073
You made it all up?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.174
Not Vanderbilt.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.643
That's a real place; I checked.

09:02.676 --> 09:06.814
(chuckles)
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.015
Shut up.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.917
(wood creaking)

09:16.790 --> 09:18.792
Crap.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.360
This'll be a great story

09:20.393 --> 09:22.162
for our wedding toast.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.333
(car horn honks)

09:26.366 --> 09:28.636
(seagulls calling)

09:28.669 --> 09:30.771
(birds singing)

09:34.808 --> 09:35.843
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.744
Please?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.211
Two prom chaperones
just dropped out,

09:38.245 --> 09:39.412
and if you don't do it,
they'll replace them

09:39.446 --> 09:41.849
with 80-year-old teachers
who don't allow slow dancing.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.050
Or fast dancing.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.185
Uh, last year,
Mrs. Pike kept Gladys Day

09:45.218 --> 09:47.821
off of the dance floor in case
her "childbearing hips"

09:47.855 --> 09:49.857
caused a frenzy
amongst the gentlemen.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.224
I appreciate your problem,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.326
but I went to one prom
my senior year

09:53.360 --> 09:55.729
where my date broke up with me
during the "Thong Song,"

09:55.763 --> 09:57.965
and I spent the rest
of the night in the corner

09:57.998 --> 09:59.232
with the other losers.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
So no, going to prom again
would just remind me

10:02.135 --> 10:04.271
that I've always sucked
at picking guys.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.374
You do push love away.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.276
Is the online
dating a bust?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.411
No, I'm getting lots
of responses

10:11.444 --> 10:13.213
from all kinds of guys.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.215
Although looking closer,
I am realizing now

10:15.248 --> 10:17.050
that most of them
are actually Meatball.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.286
I did go on two dates
just today.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.188
One reminded me

10:21.221 --> 10:23.056
too much of someone

10:23.090 --> 10:24.725
who I am trying
 to move on from,

10:24.758 --> 10:26.226
and the other,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.028
too much of someone
 who I already have.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.197
(chuckles)

10:30.230 --> 10:31.164
Look, I don't know.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.432
You know, maybe I should
just do the opposite

10:32.465 --> 10:35.703
of what my instincts tell me,
just go a totally different way.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.837
(computer chimes)

10:36.870 --> 10:38.005
Ooh, hey.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.973
This one looks promising.

10:40.007 --> 10:40.974
Good job,

10:41.008 --> 10:42.042
graduated from...

10:42.075 --> 10:44.144
Oh, no, wait. Meatball again.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.946
(closes laptop, sighs)

10:45.979 --> 10:48.348
Hey, George called
with great news.
Oh?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.684
Yeah, not only did
the court uphold our injunction

10:50.718 --> 10:51.885
against Fillmore's mall,

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
but a new survey
might give us a right

10:53.921 --> 10:56.023
to pursue damages
of adverse possession

10:56.056 --> 10:58.258
under the
Coastal Preservation Act.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.027
Goodness.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.163
Save some of that
sexy talk for bedtime.

11:03.196 --> 11:07.300
(laughs) Yeah, but the important
thing is not that we won.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.137
It's that Mayor Gainey lost.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.773
(chuckles)
Let's go get him

11:12.806 --> 11:14.742
a nice little card that says,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.810
"Sorry you lost,
you fat loser."

11:16.844 --> 11:18.278
(both chuckle)

11:20.347 --> 11:22.750
(coughs): Oh!
Oh!

11:22.783 --> 11:23.784
Oh!

11:23.817 --> 11:25.485
Smells like garbage.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.420
Smells like it's
coming from this way.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.689
Then why aren't we going
that way?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.928
Ooh, please don't be
a dead body.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.197
I will never stop
throwing up.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.232
(pigs squealing)

11:44.772 --> 11:48.041
Oh! This is the
Fillmore town line.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.477
Gainey put his dump
right up next to us

11:50.510 --> 11:52.345
just to get back at me.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.147
You want to play
that game,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.349
I am more than willing.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.986
Oh, but that's the reaction
he's expecting.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.788
You do something back,
he does something,

12:00.821 --> 12:02.455
and pretty soon
it's just about

12:02.489 --> 12:04.091
who can be more childish.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.959
Me! I can.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.162
I'm sure. But don't.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.232
The goats are
a nice touch.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.968
(coughs)

12:15.002 --> 12:16.136
(blows air)

12:17.437 --> 12:21.274
Hey, Magnolia. What's wrong?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.844
Hey, whoa now.
Now stop! Stop!

12:23.877 --> 12:26.513
Just, would you tell me
what's wrong?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.048
It's the stupid school.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.983
They said I can't go to prom

12:30.017 --> 12:31.885
if I have one tiny
nose piercing.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.054
So what? you
don't have a...

12:34.087 --> 12:37.090
Oh, Lord, you do.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.027
Magnolia Breeland,
when did you have
that done?

12:40.060 --> 12:43.530
Yesterday, right after you told
us that we have a new mommy.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.099
And-And you did this without
consulting me?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.435
Yeah. I thought that was
the new rule around here;

12:48.468 --> 12:52.806
we do whatever we want
without consulting anyone else.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.374
Okay, I do not appreciate
that attitude.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.943
And you will
take that out,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.510
or you will have
it taken out now.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.312
Why? Shelby said it looked cute.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.882
Oh. Oh, Shelby saw it?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.516
Mm-hmm, yeah, at breakfast.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.018
Oh. Shelby?

13:05.052 --> 13:06.519
Shelby, honey?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
Magnolia says that
you knew all about this,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.557
this nose-piercing stunt?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.525
Mm-hmm. Isn't it cute?

13:12.559 --> 13:13.994
No, I don't think so, no.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.996
How could you let her
get away with this?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.165
I'll give you two
some private time.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.602
Well, I didn't think
she should've done it either,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.137
but I also didn't know

13:24.171 --> 13:25.572
if I could say anything.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.075
Well, you can,
you definitely can.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.177
Well, I didn't know that.
I'm not her mom.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.913
I don't know how much say-so
I have around this house

13:32.946 --> 13:34.347
with your girls,
or anything else.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.085
Oh... you're right,
you're right.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.219
I understand.

13:39.252 --> 13:44.257
The answer is, you have
exactly as much say-so as I do.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.227
We are partners in family
matters and everything else.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.331
So feel free to
step up and speak out.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.500
Well, thank you,
that means the world to me.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.338
So, okay, partner.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.240
The nose-piercing?
Yeah.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.110
I am on it. Magnolia!

14:07.147 --> 14:08.581
Oh, hey.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.617
Uh, Rose Hattenbarger came by
a little while ago

14:10.650 --> 14:12.319
and said they need chaperones
for the prom.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.322
So could we...? I mean,
she sounded real desperate.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.990
Oh, yes, of course.
Okay.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.391
Look what I got.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.627
What is all that?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.595
Star charts.
Star...

14:22.629 --> 14:24.097
Star charts.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.099
An astrological forecast
of our lives.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.901
I gave Madame Van Horn $19.95

14:27.935 --> 14:30.537
and the exact dates
and times of our birth,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.105
and we came back
totally compatible!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.073
Oh.

14:33.106 --> 14:38.045
Oh. Well, all right.
Look at that. That's...

14:38.078 --> 14:39.947
You don't believe all this,
I can tell.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.582
No, no, I just think that if
something's gonna, I don't know,

14:42.615 --> 14:44.551
determine the course
of my whole future,

14:44.584 --> 14:47.454
I'd want it to cost
a little more than $19.95.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.322
Well, you can be skeptical,

14:49.356 --> 14:51.458
but now I don't have to worry
about Zoe Hart,

14:51.491 --> 14:54.427
because I know we are destined
to be together.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.163
It says so right here.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.933
Oh. Birth time
6:05 a.m., huh?

14:59.967 --> 15:02.702
Yeah, I got it from your file
of "If I die" papers.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.137
Why?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.372
Uh, no reason, no reason.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.076
I just... I didn't realize I was
always such an early riser.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.343
I'm like, I'm like a rooster!

15:10.377 --> 15:12.279
Yeah! (chuckles)
Yeah!

15:12.312 --> 15:14.147
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

15:15.648 --> 15:19.519
Oh, my God, you guys
look so nice.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.154
Thanks inviting me
to join you.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.090
I hope I am not
a third wheel.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.392
Oh, no, no, no, not at all.
Although nothing says

15:25.425 --> 15:27.494
"smooth ride"
like a fourth wheel.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.461
What's going on?

15:28.495 --> 15:31.364
We found you a date.
Well, Max did.
What?

15:31.398 --> 15:35.435
Oh, and here he is. Dr. Hart,
meet Michael, my father.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.570
Your...?
So nice to meet you.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.173
Oh, my gosh, would you look
at the time!

15:40.207 --> 15:44.177
Oh, we have to go and do
homework before the prom. Bye.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.578
Mm-hmm.
Rose!

15:45.612 --> 15:49.949
Well, you did say
"totally different." Bye!

15:52.219 --> 15:53.553
Hey.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.757
Thanks for coming out
so fast, man.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.393
All your online reviews say
how in demand you are.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.763
Yeah, it's a good thing you got
me between jobs.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.665
Your main support beam
is near-about busted

16:05.698 --> 16:06.733
all the way through.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.101
No way.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.502
(wood creaks)
Whoa!

16:09.536 --> 16:12.405
See there? Hell, I'm afraid
to even let go of it

16:12.439 --> 16:14.674
long enough to get my jack
and shore it up.

16:14.707 --> 16:19.212
Well, here,
let me help you out.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.413
All right.
All right.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.084
(grunts) Okay.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.486
Yeah, keep it just like that,
perfectly straight.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.022
That thing moves
even a little bit,

16:29.056 --> 16:31.424
every wall in this place
will come down.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.493
Fun as it may be to watch,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.628
your joy is liable
to be short-lived.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.763
Yeah? Well, I got it.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.998
Why don't you go get
that jack, huh?

16:45.705 --> 16:47.640
Hey! What are you doing?!

16:47.674 --> 16:50.277
Hey!
Like I said,

16:50.310 --> 16:52.779
I'm between jobs.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.184
Well, hey, get back here,
damn it!

16:57.217 --> 16:59.652
Well, I will not be writing
a very favorable online review!

16:59.686 --> 17:02.021
Oh! Goll...

17:07.394 --> 17:09.262
Well, Max's mom
remarried

17:09.296 --> 17:10.597
to a real nice guy.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.433
Nice enough guy.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.136
People seem to like him.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.436
(both chuckle)

17:17.470 --> 17:19.306
So, I think Max worries
about me,

17:19.339 --> 17:20.673
wants me to have someone.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.276
Seems like he wants me
to have someone, too. (chuckles)

17:23.310 --> 17:24.743
You know, I don't
even have time

17:24.777 --> 17:27.214
to think about dating,
what with all my interests

17:27.247 --> 17:28.548
and work and parenthood.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.318
But Max told me
about you, and, well,

17:31.351 --> 17:32.619
I just couldn't say no.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.488
That is so nice.
He's a good kid.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.090
He lacks boundaries.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.192
True, mm-hmm.
Yeah.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.594
Well, I hate
to end this,

17:41.628 --> 17:44.097
but I am actually
chaperoning the prom.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.865
Oh!
Max isn't too thrilled
about it,

17:45.898 --> 17:49.569
but it beats finding out
later that he left with
his math teacher.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.570
Funny.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.739
Yeah.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.308
Well...

17:55.342 --> 17:57.244
See you later.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.479
Mr. Burgess.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.315
Wade, I called Eric,
the contractor, to find out why

18:02.349 --> 18:04.451
he never called me,
and he said he was fired.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.852
Do you know...?

18:05.885 --> 18:09.222
I suppose you have something
to say about this.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.459
Well, I really wouldn't know
where to begin.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.327
Well, I hired a guy
on the cheap.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.796
And I put the money to pay him
in the till.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.198
And then he took it.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.602
I'm inclined to believe that his
Web site was not authentic.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.138
Now if you would please find
something

18:25.172 --> 18:27.207
to help me brace
this beam up with.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.577
Sure. I just need
to hear those three
little words.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.611
I'm an idiot.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.380
Those are the ones.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.215
I'm sorry, Lemon. I really am.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.616
Now we don't have money
for repairs,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.885
and we can't open the restaurant
to get the money

18:38.918 --> 18:40.387
without doing the repairs.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.556
(sighs) It's fine.
I'll figure something out.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.225
Everybody makes mistakes.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.261
Well, that's very nice of you.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.497
Guess what mine was.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.436
Why are we
stopping here?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.538
Our barbecue's
gonna get cold.

18:58.571 --> 19:03.510
Just need to make
one quick delivery.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.512
In Fillmore?

19:05.545 --> 19:08.681
Is this Mayor Gainey's house?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.285
No. Oh, no.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.720
Lavon!

19:13.753 --> 19:14.754
Yeah.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.628
What are you...?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.631
How do you like that how,
Gainey?!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.633
(laughs)

19:28.268 --> 19:30.770
Well, I should have
knowed by the smell

19:30.803 --> 19:33.240
someone from BlueBell
was outside. No offense.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.242
Yeah, that smell is
from the dump you put up

19:35.275 --> 19:36.576
right up against
our town line!

19:36.609 --> 19:38.411
And how's anyone supposed
to know the difference

19:38.445 --> 19:40.247
between a dump and the
BlueBell town line?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.714
Todd Sr., get back
in the house!

19:41.748 --> 19:44.751
Remove the dump, Gainey, or
things are gonna get real ugly.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.786
Oh, is is time for the
Miss BlueBell contest again?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.855
What?!
Lavon, get in
that car!

19:48.888 --> 19:50.557
This ain't over, Gainey!

19:50.590 --> 19:51.958
Oh, it'd be over
right here and now

19:51.991 --> 19:53.226
if someone hadn't taken
my crossbow!

19:53.260 --> 19:54.627
Oh, I'm here.
I'm right here.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.730
In the house now.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.269
Sorry for the mess.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.971
Y'all eat a lot of fruit.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.639
We should eat more fruit.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.275
(grunting)

20:08.308 --> 20:09.542
That is what I was
talking about!

20:09.576 --> 20:10.877
One thing leads
to another,

20:10.910 --> 20:12.712
and then suddenly
BlueBell is nothing

20:12.745 --> 20:14.447
but a smoking hole
in the ground!

20:14.481 --> 20:16.883
Well, I'd rather it be destroyed
than polluted by Gainey!

20:16.916 --> 20:18.385
Shh, shh.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.919
Mrs. Gainey seemed reasonable.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.654
Maybe the two of us could talk.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.623
No, no. You can't trust her.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.626
This is mayor stuff.
You don't understand.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.728
I understand this is how
wars get started.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.030
The trouble in
the Middle East

20:31.063 --> 20:32.865
is probably over something
just as stupid.

20:32.899 --> 20:37.437
Although, to be honest, I don't
keep up with it like I should.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.476
Evening.
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.977
No, come on in, sit.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.946
Oh.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.482
What is it? You look so serious.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.884
Well, that's because I'm here
on a serious errand

20:51.918 --> 20:52.985
of a business nature.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.388
I was hoping that we could talk.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.489
Yeah.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.858
Oh, I can go read
in another room.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.627
Such a big old house.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.595
It's funny how every
conversation seems

21:02.629 --> 21:04.297
to happen
in this one room.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.365
No, stay now.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.899
Lemon, I was
telling Shelby today

21:06.933 --> 21:09.469
how she is now an equal part
of my life,

21:09.502 --> 21:10.970
so there's no reason
she should go.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.906
Well, all right.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.609
Uh, the short version is

21:16.643 --> 21:18.645
that the Rammer Jammer was
robbed this evening.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.313
It what?!
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

21:20.347 --> 21:22.382
I'm fine, the police
have been notified.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.950
But it's created a lack of funds

21:23.983 --> 21:25.918
to make the necessary repairs
for us to open.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.887
Say no more.
How much do you need?

21:27.920 --> 21:29.356
Listen, it's not
a handout.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.659
It would be a business loan,
with interest.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.627
I haven't had time
to go to the lawyer's

21:34.661 --> 21:35.895
to draw up the papers,

21:35.928 --> 21:37.997
but it's amazing what you can do
these days

21:38.030 --> 21:39.932
with the Internet
and $19.95.
Mm...

21:39.966 --> 21:42.635
Is there something you want
to say, hon?

21:42.669 --> 21:45.338
Well you told me to speak up
in family matters.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.039
Well, I'm sure he was
just being polite.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.941
No, I meant it.
Say what you want.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.811
It's just that you have been
so proud of Lemon standing

21:51.844 --> 21:53.546
on her own two feet
with all

21:53.580 --> 21:55.682
the slings and arrows
coming her way this year.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.417
BRICK:
It is true--
I'm very proud.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.352
And I don't see how

21:59.386 --> 22:01.688
bailing her out now
will do her any favors.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.823
Oh, well, it's not a favor.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.824
It's-it's a loan.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.759
But isn't that what banks
are for and insurance,

22:06.793 --> 22:08.761
and all the other things
that business owners have

22:08.795 --> 22:11.698
when they can't run
to their family?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.000
Well, I'm-I'm sure
that that's true.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.603
And, of course, it kills
me to come here...

22:16.636 --> 22:18.971
If it's none of my business,
then it's not,

22:19.005 --> 22:20.540
but it seems to me,

22:20.573 --> 22:21.974
that the kindest thing

22:22.008 --> 22:25.978
is the hardest and that's
to let Lemon work this out

22:26.012 --> 22:28.515
on her own like
she has been doing

22:28.548 --> 22:31.751
so amazingly well so far.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.723
Well, you-you have
been pretty adamant

22:36.756 --> 22:38.991
about that very point.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.627
You know what?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.161
Of course I have been.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.864
And... you're so right.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.799
Thank you, Shelby,
for popping up

22:46.833 --> 22:49.001
and reminding me of that.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.837
Well,

22:50.870 --> 22:53.473
this is absolutely
for the best.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.141
I will work this
out on my own.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.009
Shelby, enjoy your wine.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.511
Take small sips.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.112
Don't choke.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.185
Hey, Tansy?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.722
Have you seen that blue shirt
that I had laid out for tonight?

23:09.756 --> 23:11.491
Oh, I forgot.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.893
After seeing how well our star
charts worked out,

23:13.926 --> 23:17.664
I went back
to Madame Van Horn, and...

23:17.697 --> 23:18.998
had our color charts done.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.567
And it turns out

23:20.600 --> 23:22.769
that you have been wearing
too many cool colors

23:22.802 --> 23:25.004
when warm colors
are more in harmony

23:25.037 --> 23:27.139
with your natural energy,
so I put some stuff

23:27.173 --> 23:28.174
in the giveaway pile.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.042
Yeah, but I liked
that blue shirt.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.845
Also I realized after
studying our star charts

23:32.879 --> 23:35.715
why I have been feeling
so off balance lately.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.917
It's because you and I
are both fire signs

23:37.950 --> 23:39.051
and we live on the water.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.521
Our energy is being doused.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.889
Of course, duh.
But

23:42.922 --> 23:44.757
I like living on a boat, so...

23:44.791 --> 23:46.726
Me, too, and we still can,
we just have to move it up

23:46.759 --> 23:48.895
on to land, you know, I called
a guy who has a trailer, so...

23:48.928 --> 23:52.064
Okay, no, Tansy, no,
we're not moving the boat.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.800
And I would

23:53.833 --> 23:56.002
really like
my blue shirt back, please.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.571
And I am not surprised.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.206
The chart says
that you, Saturn,

24:00.239 --> 24:02.809
um, can be hard to change
your ways and critical

24:02.842 --> 24:04.677
of Mercury's new ideas.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.013
Yeah, that's because
her ideas are nuts.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.081
I'm sorry?

24:09.115 --> 24:10.550
Tansy, listen, the only reason

24:10.583 --> 24:12.719
I let you believe all that
nonsense is

24:12.752 --> 24:14.687
because you seem to need
some external validation

24:14.721 --> 24:18.090
of our compatibility.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.227
Uh, what do you mean
"let me believe"?

24:21.260 --> 24:24.897
The birth time
that you gave her-- 6:05 a.m.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.734
I was born at 6:05 p.m., okay?

24:27.767 --> 24:29.702
But nevertheless

24:29.736 --> 24:33.105
I believe that
we still belong together.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.841
And that psychic?

24:34.874 --> 24:37.777
Well, she-she can just
stay the hell out of it.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.045
(laughs)

24:39.078 --> 24:40.847
Okay, then.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.515
I appreciate your honesty.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.584
We should get ready
for prom now.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.619
Don't want to be late.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.559
Yeah, I got you a corsage.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.764
(whistling)

24:57.797 --> 24:59.165
Ooh.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.299
Another Internet date?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.735
A blind date if you must know.

25:02.769 --> 25:03.803
You tell him you love him yet?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.538
Hey, you know what guys

25:05.572 --> 25:08.274
really like is when you
stand outside their house

25:08.307 --> 25:10.677
with a boom box over
your head, yeah.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.912
Yeah, you heard
what I told George?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.246
Well, if it bothers
you so much,

25:14.280 --> 25:15.247
just say so--
don't be an ass.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.649
Oh, it doesn't bother me.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.685
You know, I love watching

25:18.718 --> 25:20.620
you and your little drama--
it's kind of...

25:20.653 --> 25:22.789
what passes for entertainment
around here.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.923
Drama?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.024
Drama?!

25:25.057 --> 25:26.025
Drama!

25:26.058 --> 25:28.260
Ooh, my God.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.361
Drama is the last thing I want.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.965
All this-- the makeups,
the breakups, the emotions?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.601
Look, all I want

25:34.634 --> 25:36.068
is a stable adult and calm.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.070
You know, someone
I can relax with.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.639
Sure.
Laugh with.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.575
Kind of like the guy
I was with tonight.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.977
Oh, my God,
that is who I should date.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.813
Someone who doesn't make me
feel like I'm always

25:46.846 --> 25:48.881
back in high school.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.016
Where you going?

25:50.049 --> 25:51.884
To prom.

25:55.387 --> 25:59.325
* You don't love me
like you used to *

25:59.358 --> 26:01.160
* Just a spirit

26:01.193 --> 26:03.963
* Haunting my bedroom...

26:03.996 --> 26:05.665
Mr. Burgess?

26:05.698 --> 26:06.833
Yeah.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.201
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble...

26:09.235 --> 26:11.203
but I'm worried that
someone spiked the punch.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.239
Come on.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.944
Well, let's see.

26:20.379 --> 26:23.816
I can't tell, so
just to be safe,

26:23.850 --> 26:26.385
I'll take this and you pour a
new batch in that clean bowl.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.621
Of course.

26:31.390 --> 26:36.095
* I always wanted just
to hold you close *

26:36.128 --> 26:40.833
* I'm buried in the pockets
of my coat *

26:40.867 --> 26:42.935
* Alone with all...

26:42.969 --> 26:45.404
(clears throat)

26:45.437 --> 26:47.974
"Magic in the stars."

26:48.007 --> 26:49.842
Poor kids don't know
there isn't any.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.845
The stars are just gassy balls
that died a long time ago.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.814
Oh.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.883
That wouldn't have made
a pretty banner.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.986
Listen, Tans, we can go
get our charts redone

27:00.019 --> 27:01.854
if you want to with
the right information,

27:01.888 --> 27:04.323
but it seems to me, for some
reason, you are looking

27:04.356 --> 27:05.758
for a problem
in our relationship

27:05.792 --> 27:07.694
where there
really isn't one.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.829
I have been known
to do that.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.832
Well, you don't need
a strip-mall psychic, okay?

27:12.865 --> 27:16.402
Just listen to your gut
and trust us.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.005
And stop worrying
that Zoe Hart's gonna

27:19.038 --> 27:20.239
keep on popping up
everywhere.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.340
(laughs)
Okay?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.710
Hi. Nice prom.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.377
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.213
Ooh, excuse me.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.248
Have fun.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.187
(clears throat)
Hey, Lemon.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.356
I heard the
Rammer Jammer's

27:37.389 --> 27:39.358
closed up-- I'm sorry.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.360
Only for a short while.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.896
We'll reopen as soon as I secure
the necessary finances.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.699
Scratchers?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.170
This is your financial plan?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.706
Well, I mean, it wasn't.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.175
I was going to get
a business loan from my father

27:56.208 --> 27:58.310
until Shelby stuck
her nose in.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.847
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.348
Is there anything
I can do to help?

28:03.816 --> 28:04.951
Yes.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.485
Can you scratch these?

28:06.518 --> 28:07.553
My hand's cramping.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.757
I mean, maybe I could
give you a loan. (laughs)

28:10.790 --> 28:12.224
What?

28:12.258 --> 28:13.425
Lavon, no.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.261
That's sweet of you,

28:15.294 --> 28:16.295
but I can't take money from you.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.163
Don't be silly.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.498
Why is it silly
to take money from me?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.801
I don't know, it's just...

28:21.834 --> 28:23.936
because...

28:23.970 --> 28:25.805
You know, because...

28:28.374 --> 28:30.376
(groans)

28:31.911 --> 28:34.814
Shelby was right.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.849
Crap.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.488
Where you going?

28:42.521 --> 28:45.024
I have no idea.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.093
But I'm gonna get there
on my own two feet.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.128
Not on my knees begging.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.503
Shelby, I need to run
a quick little errand.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.738
I will be right back.

29:01.007 --> 29:04.476
Don't forget the check
you wrote Lemon.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.279
And on the memo line where
it says what it's for,

29:07.313 --> 29:10.116
why don't you just write
"Undermining my fiancée"?

29:10.149 --> 29:12.852
Okay, look, I-I was
not undermining you.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.887
You told me to
involve myself

29:14.921 --> 29:16.555
like I was a partner
in this family.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.990
And you should, you are.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.392
But then you go to
Lemon behind my back

29:20.426 --> 29:21.527
like I'm not a partner

29:21.560 --> 29:22.862
and I don't know
where I stand.

29:22.895 --> 29:23.896
Look, Lemon is

29:23.930 --> 29:26.398
my daughter, and she is hurting.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.367
And I think when someone
you love needs your help,

29:28.400 --> 29:29.535
you don't turn
your back on them.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.437
I realize that.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.172
Well, I'm not so sure you do.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.440
Well, what does that mean?

29:34.473 --> 29:37.043
Because you are supposed to be
there for people you care about.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.311
And not just run away
the second things get rough

29:39.345 --> 29:41.013
and go shopping.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.285
I thought you weren't
mad about that.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.325
Well, apparently I am.

30:04.203 --> 30:07.173
* You could break a heart

30:07.206 --> 30:10.309
* In your sleep

30:10.342 --> 30:11.577
* Yeah, the way...

30:11.610 --> 30:13.412
Oh, my God, Michael?

30:13.445 --> 30:16.448
I totally forgot you were
chaperoning prom, too.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.616
ROSE: Zoe?

30:17.649 --> 30:20.186
I thought you weren't coming.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.621
Joking. You never get my jokes.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.091
Well, my dad's not dancing,

30:25.124 --> 30:27.493
and you're not
dancing, so...

30:27.526 --> 30:29.295
Oh... Oh,
I don't want to...

30:29.328 --> 30:30.362
Dance.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.597
Oh.
(laughs)

30:31.630 --> 30:33.832
Okay.

30:36.268 --> 30:40.907
* You've never been alone...

30:40.940 --> 30:43.175
I have a confession.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.978
I wasn't sure about
our setup at first.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.380
Well, you were a good sport.
Listen.

30:48.414 --> 30:51.951
I'm used to dating
a different kind of guy.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.053
But I had a great
time with you.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.990
I've been running around
chasing dysfunctional

30:58.024 --> 31:00.927
relationships ever
since I got to BlueBell.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.062
But a different guy
is what I need.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.131
Someone more adult.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.066
Hey, turns out you're an adult.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.368
Yeah... no.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.436
What?

31:10.469 --> 31:12.104
I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.306
But why not?
Frankly,

31:14.340 --> 31:16.442
um, I don't need the drama.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.910
Drama?

31:17.944 --> 31:19.979
What is this drama
I keep being accused of?

31:20.012 --> 31:21.213
I don't want the drama either.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.414
That's why I'm here.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.450
I've listened
to your dating stories

31:24.483 --> 31:28.020
and you may think you don't
want drama, but you do.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.621
Maybe you do.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.457
Or what did you mean
when you

31:31.490 --> 31:35.027
said you heard about me
and you couldn't say no?

31:35.061 --> 31:37.096
I meant I couldn't say no.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.597
Max and Rose wouldn't let me.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.399
They were worried about you.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.301
I'm sorry.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.435
What?!

31:43.469 --> 31:45.304
You think you can do better?

31:45.337 --> 31:48.374
Look around, pal, look around.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.642
(applause, cheering)

31:55.314 --> 31:57.016
Hey, there, homewrecker.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.127
TANSY:
Oh, look.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.695
There's a happy couple.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.164
Maybe you should
break them up.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.166
Okay, I'm gonna go home.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.568
I should never have
come here anyway.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.170
When has that ever stopped you?

32:18.204 --> 32:20.572
Tansy, I said that I was
sorry for the other night.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.174
Not to me.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.343
Oh, well, I am, and I promise

32:24.376 --> 32:27.046
that it will never happen again.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.514
And this is where I say,
"Oh, that's all right,"

32:28.547 --> 32:30.416
like I do every time
it looks like there's

32:30.449 --> 32:32.484
something going on between
you and my boyfriend.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.021
What did you think was
gonna happen anyway?

32:35.054 --> 32:36.422
I don't know.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.523
Were you hoping
that he'd run off

32:37.556 --> 32:39.191
with you and leave
me brokenhearted?

32:39.225 --> 32:40.592
No... I don't know.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.660
Look, I'm sorry.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.196
I wasn't thinking
about anyone else.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.197
Because we are
not all characters

32:45.231 --> 32:47.066
in the Zoe Hart
"Who do I love today?" story.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.567
And you can't just
say you have feelings

32:48.600 --> 32:51.237
for someone's boyfriend and
then say, "Oops, never mind."

32:51.270 --> 32:52.604
You're right!

32:52.638 --> 32:55.741
There is something terribly
wrong with me, okay?

32:55.774 --> 32:57.076
I am...

32:57.109 --> 32:59.178
very, very sorry!

32:59.211 --> 33:01.147
(sighs)

33:03.315 --> 33:05.284
MICHAEL:
Again...

33:05.317 --> 33:07.253
drama.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.388
What? Me?

33:09.421 --> 33:10.756
But she...!

33:10.789 --> 33:13.025
No. You gotta go.

33:15.694 --> 33:16.695
Man...

33:21.433 --> 33:23.435
*

33:30.809 --> 33:32.578
From the lady down the bar.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.323
I can't see
anything.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.624
Neither can I.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.260
Oh! Good.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.495
It's you.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.730
Um, Mrs. Gainey,
thank you

33:51.763 --> 33:54.266
for meeting me here
to talk things out.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.236
I'll admit,
it's not easy being here.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.272
Oh, because you're deceiving
your husband?

34:00.306 --> 34:02.474
No, because I'm
an alcoholic.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.776
Oh. Sorry.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.117
As your Mayor Hayes
suspected,

34:11.150 --> 34:12.851
the dump was
Todd's retaliation

34:12.884 --> 34:14.420
for losing his
beloved mall.

34:14.453 --> 34:17.289
The mall was a nonstarter
for the mayor.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.425
But I'm sure two women of reason

34:19.458 --> 34:20.859
can find a compromise.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.527
Yes.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.230
But I can't ask the mayor

34:24.263 --> 34:25.364
to remove the dump

34:25.397 --> 34:29.101
without taking back something
significant in exchange.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.170
There may be something

34:32.204 --> 34:34.806
I can persuade the mayor
to part with.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.376
But it'll hurt him to do it.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.510
Well...

34:38.543 --> 34:41.847
it's not a compromise
unless everyone hurts a little.

34:51.357 --> 34:53.625
Tans, hey,
Tansy, hold on.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.561
Baby, where you going?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.896
I think there might
be something wrong
with the punch.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.431
(sniffs)
Why? What...

34:59.465 --> 35:00.666
what happened?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.368
George, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to find

35:02.401 --> 35:03.602
a problem where
there isn't one,

35:03.635 --> 35:04.603
but there
is one.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.871
To me.
All right?

35:05.904 --> 35:07.639
I just can't be
in the same place

35:07.673 --> 35:09.575
as Zoe Hart.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.410
Okay.
Well, you're not anymore,

35:11.443 --> 35:12.511
you're out here, so...

35:12.544 --> 35:13.545
No.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.148
Listen...

35:16.182 --> 35:18.484
as long as we're in BlueBell,
she'll be around.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.220
And you say
you don't have
feelings for her,

35:21.253 --> 35:22.854
and you probably
believe that's true,

35:22.888 --> 35:24.756
but I don't.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.558
I'm sorry, I just don't.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.494
And you said "Go
with your gut,"

35:28.527 --> 35:29.495
and my gut

35:29.528 --> 35:30.896
says, "Get out of town."

35:30.929 --> 35:32.764
Whoa. Okay.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.899
Tansy, what...

35:35.701 --> 35:38.304
What exactly
are you saying, here?

35:38.337 --> 35:39.538
We live on a boat.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.906
It's not that hard
to go someplace else.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.441
I mean, three-quarters
of the world is water.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.442
Okay, are you

35:43.475 --> 35:45.544
seriously asking me to...

35:45.577 --> 35:47.779
to leave BlueBell?

35:49.481 --> 35:50.949
Yes.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.319
George, if you

35:53.352 --> 35:55.854
really do think
we belong together,

35:55.887 --> 35:59.391
like you said we do,
then...

35:59.425 --> 36:01.393
you will start over with me.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.161
Someplace else.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.865
Away from here.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.542
To our grand experiment
in bar ownership.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.377
Nope, I'm not ready
to give up yet

36:18.410 --> 36:20.712
and prove those naysayers right.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.281
I'll find the money somehow.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.217
I'll turn to crime...
sell my body.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.985
What, to medical science or...?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.289
Hey, don't be mean.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.459
Hey, don't be drinking up
all your stock yet.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.826
You need it to reopen.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.296
Hey, buddy, you want
to buy a bar?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.631
We almost have a skylight.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.767
I want to help, and, uh,

36:41.800 --> 36:42.968
don't worry, I'm not
here to offer money.

36:43.001 --> 36:43.969
Really?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.971
Is it too late to ask again?
Yup.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.240
Instead I brought this.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.944
I figure with all
of us pitching in,

36:52.978 --> 36:54.680
we'll get this place up
and running by breakfast.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.417
Now, I would like scrambled eggs
and some wheat toast, please.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.687
Lavon, everyone, I don't
even know what to say.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.989
See, I told you we didn't need
to hire that fancy contractor.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.023
(both laugh)

37:05.056 --> 37:06.358
All right.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.003
I'm sorry

37:18.036 --> 37:19.971
I blew up like that.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.840
I wish you'd come
in here sooner.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.809
I just bought four pairs
of shoes I can't afford,

37:23.842 --> 37:26.778
and I'm still a purse away
from feeling better.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.882
(sighs)

37:32.718 --> 37:36.322
You know, I wasn't
aware of it,

37:36.355 --> 37:39.491
but clearly I am
having trouble

37:39.525 --> 37:41.527
trusting you.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.796
With my girls and...

37:44.830 --> 37:46.498
with my heart.

37:46.532 --> 37:48.667
For good reason.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.035
I know that.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.904
We decided to get married
so fast and under duress.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.441
Yeah, and maybe even
under sedation.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.842
Kidding.

37:56.875 --> 37:57.976
(laughs) No.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.978
And I had just
gotten scared

38:00.011 --> 38:02.614
and run away, and you got
scared that I got scared.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.317
And I think that
the problem is

38:05.351 --> 38:07.519
neither one of us know

38:07.553 --> 38:09.755
where we stand
with each other.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.657
Yeah.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.991
Except we love each other.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.594
Yes, we do.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.796
You know, sad part is

38:17.829 --> 38:18.930
if-if we were already married,
I probably wouldn't

38:18.964 --> 38:22.468
even be worried about you
committing to me anymore.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.370
Because I'd already
be committed to you.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.405
Yeah, I mean, I was married.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.874
I know how to do that, it's
just this in-between part.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.409
Oh, it's so confusing.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.345
I didn't ask you to be
my fiancée for God sake.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.713
I asked you to be my wife.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.848
We should've just skipped
this whole part.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.517
I know, right?

38:38.550 --> 38:40.419
It's like Chutes and Ladders.
Yup, zoom.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.789
Here we go.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.392
Well, that wouldn't be
the most rational move.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.126
No, no, it wouldn't.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.662
Although being rational

38:50.696 --> 38:52.531
is kind of overrated.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.899
True.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.568
I've been rational
my whole life.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.704
Me, I've been mostly
the opposite.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.572
Show me how.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.107
I'm free tomorrow.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.510
So am I.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.712
(both laugh)

39:09.848 --> 39:10.816
Are we getting married?

39:10.849 --> 39:11.983
Mm-hmm.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.852
You know,

39:13.885 --> 39:15.954
we should probably
do this out of town.

39:15.987 --> 39:19.858
BlueBell weddings, they
can be fraught with peril.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.092
(laughs)

39:22.828 --> 39:24.830
*

39:28.033 --> 39:30.702
ANNABETH:
Lavon?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.738
Lavon, guess what?

39:32.771 --> 39:36.475
Guess who made a deal tonight
with Mayor Gainey's wife?

39:36.508 --> 39:38.009
I really hope it's not
you 'cause I asked you

39:38.043 --> 39:39.144
to stay out of it.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.612
I know, but I didn't.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.948
Oh, AnnaBeth,
this is official business.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.616
This is like if
the First Lady talked

39:44.650 --> 39:46.718
to North Korea without
telling the president.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.720
Okay, well, it's not.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.657
But what if the First Lady got
Fillmore to move its dump,

39:51.690 --> 39:53.459
and all BlueBell had
to do was cancel

39:53.492 --> 39:54.960
its Fourth of July fireworks.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.895
What? The fireworks?

39:56.928 --> 39:59.498
Now we have to cancel
the town's fireworks?

39:59.531 --> 40:01.500
Take your time.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.868
Oh.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.636
There you go.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.072
The fire department won't let us
have fireworks this year anyway.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.575
On account we burned down
the old pier last year.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.909
That is correct.

40:10.942 --> 40:14.746
So, you got rid of the dump
and gave up nothing?

40:14.780 --> 40:17.182
Aren't you glad
I'm on your side?

40:17.215 --> 40:19.485
(laughs)

40:19.518 --> 40:20.586
Oh.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.753
Hey, George.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.455
Glad you could make.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.923
Tansy coming?

40:24.956 --> 40:27.125
No.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.027
Later?

40:29.060 --> 40:31.797
No.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.064
Okay.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.667
You all right?

40:35.701 --> 40:38.103
No.

40:39.705 --> 40:40.739
You want to hit stuff?

40:40.772 --> 40:42.207
Yeah.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.442
Have fun.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.149
(sighs)

40:51.182 --> 40:52.884
Ooh, ooh, let me guess.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.821
Somebody else got voted
prom queen.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.561
I've had a very hard night.

41:02.594 --> 41:06.097
And I feel terrible.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.600
So for awhile...

41:08.634 --> 41:10.969
tonight...

41:11.002 --> 41:13.004
I'd like to feel better.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.474
And not talk.

41:37.328 --> 41:41.533
