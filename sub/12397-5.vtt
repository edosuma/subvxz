02:53.800 --> 02:55.267
SO I CAN PAY
THIS BILL.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.836
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
I PAID MY INSURANCE

02:56.870 --> 02:59.009
THE DAY I BOUGHT MY MOTORCYCLE,
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.099
- YEAH, AND THIS BILL'S BEEN
COMING TO MY PLACE EVER SINCE.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.973
- OH, POP,
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SCAMS

03:04.010 --> 03:05.944
THAT THE ELDERLY
OFTEN FALL FOR.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.311
- SHAWN, IN ORDER
TO HAVE A LICENSE,

03:07.350 --> 03:09.011
YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP
YOUR INSURANCE PAYMENTS.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.039
THAT'S THE LAW.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.341
- WHAT, ARE YOU JOKING?

I PAY FOR YOUR INSURANCE,
JULIET PAYS FOR YOUR RENT,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.548
AND GUSTER PAYS
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.749

BALD-FACED LIES,

03:21.800 --> 03:23.324
AND YOU ARE
A BALD-HEADED LIAR!

03:23.370 --> 03:25.895

CALLED A MONTHLY NUT.

THAT'S WHAT YOUR FRIENDS
ARE OUT THERE WORKING FOR

03:27.670 --> 03:29.194
WHILE YOU'RE ENJOYING
HAMMOCK TIME.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.707
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,
THAT I'M A LEECH?

03:30.740 --> 03:32.276
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I MAY THINK IT.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.800
I MAY NOD
WHEN OTHERS SAY IT,

03:33.840 --> 03:35.000
BUT I DEFINITELY
DIDN'T SAY IT.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.200
- WELL, GOOD,

03:36.250 --> 03:37.842
BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.814
THINGS HAVE JUST BEEN
A LITTLE TIGHT LATELY.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.715
TROUT DIDN'T HIRE US,

03:41.750 --> 03:42.842

HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN--

03:42.890 --> 03:44.812

PAYING FOR THINGS.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.454
THAT'S WHY I LET HIM.
'CAUSE IT MAKES HIM FEEL GOOD.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.788

03:50.330 --> 03:51.888
WHAT, YOU JUST WANT ME
TO TAKE STOCK OF MYSELF?

03:51.930 --> 03:53.818
- I JUST WANT TO PAY
THIS BILL.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.623
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.196
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT
MYSELF.

03:57.230 --> 04:01.098
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I AM A GROWN-ASS MAN.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.564
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.974
- [scoffs]

04:11.850 --> 04:14.068
- SORRY, SPENCER,
I CANNOT HELP YOU.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.816

04:16.850 --> 04:18.044
JUST GIVE ME ONE

04:18.090 --> 04:19.819
- NO, NO,
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.885
TROUT GOING 5150 WAS
THE STROKE OF LUCK I NEEDED

04:21.920 --> 04:23.126
TO GET ME OUT OF
THOSE HORRIBLE BLUES

04:23.160 --> 04:24.752
AND BACK ONTO HOMICIDE,

04:24.790 --> 04:26.052
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO JEOPARDIZE THAT

04:26.090 --> 04:27.648
BY HIRING
YOUR SLACKER ASS.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.997
NO OFFENSE.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.365
WHEN I SAID,
"DO NOT COME HERE"?

05:43.410 --> 05:44.502
- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THEM.

05:44.540 --> 05:45.905
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THIS.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.271
THE MURDER VIBE
IS STRONG,

05:47.310 --> 05:49.232
AND I AM SENSING
BILLABLE HOURS.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.009

05:51.050 --> 05:52.472
YOU WANNA SEE WHAT
A TEXTBOOK SUICIDE LOOKS LIKE?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.249
FEAST YOUR EYES.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.271
- MM.
THIS LOOKS LIKE MY PLACE.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.280
DUDE, THAT'S THE HUTCH
THAT I ORDERED.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.854
- OKAY, GUS.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.118
- MEET THE LATE JOHN RUSSELL.
AGE 35.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.264
ACCORDING TO HIS BUSINESS CARD,
HE WORKED A DEAD-END JOB

06:11.300 --> 06:12.995
AS A SALES REP
AT SOME PLACE CALLED

06:13.040 --> 06:14.393

06:14.440 --> 06:17.000
BY ALL APPEARANCES,
HE LIVED ALONE.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.304
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.308
- NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.
NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE.

06:21.340 --> 06:25.049
NO SIGN OF A SIGNIFICANT OTHER
IN HIS LIFE.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.968
EMPTY PILL BO'I'I'LE
NEAR HIS HAND.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.079
THE BROTHER
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CAT.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.112
- WELL, I WILL ADMIT
THAT AS FAR AS MURDERS GO,

06:32.150 --> 06:35.916
THIS FEELS SUBTLE.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.794
GUS.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.491
GUS?
- WHAT?

06:41.530 --> 06:44.522
- YOU ALL RIGHT UP THERE?

MM-MMM.
NO.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.804

07:23.840 --> 07:26.058
- WHO GIVES A BOWLING TROPHY
FOR SIXTH PLACE?

07:26.110 --> 07:27.702
- I GOT SIXTH PLACE ONCE.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.332
IT'S A HARD THING TO DO.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.439
TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE OTHER GUYS

07:31.480 --> 07:33.072
SUDDENLY GET HOT
WITH THE BALL,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.247
AND THERE YOU ARE--
SIXTH PLACE.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.713
DOES THAT MAKE ME
A BAD BOWLER?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.583
DOES IT?

07:42.490 --> 07:46.028
JOHN RUSSELL.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.425
[whispers]
RUSS.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.258
- THIS GUY WAS
AS AVERAGE AS THEY COME,

07:50.300 --> 07:52.325
A FACELESS COG
WHO FINALLY REALIZED THAT LIFE

07:52.370 --> 07:54.395
WASN'T GONNA GET ANY BETTER,
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

07:54.440 --> 07:57.136
I THINK WE'RE SAFE
TO CALL THIS ONE A SUICIDE.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.637
- NO! NO!

07:58.670 --> 08:00.274
THIS WAS A GOOD MAN

08:00.310 --> 08:02.699
WHO LIVED A RICH, PROPER,
AND FULL LIFE.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.377
A MAN WHO HAD IT ALL.

08:04.410 --> 08:06.970
COME HERE.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.419
DO THE THING YOU DO
AND SAY IT'S MURDER.

08:08.450 --> 08:09.644
- GUS, NOBODY
WANTS THIS TO BE A MURDER

08:09.690 --> 08:11.112
MORE THAN I DO,
BUT CHECK IT OUT.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.084
- TELL THEM IT'S MURDER,
SHAWN.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.112
TELL THEM IT'S MURDER.
- AAH!

08:16.160 --> 08:18.321
- THIS MAN
WAS A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN

08:18.360 --> 08:20.294
OF THE WORLD, AND HE
DID NOT GO OUT LIKE THIS.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.525
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

08:22.570 --> 08:24.993
THAT I'VE BEEN MURDERED.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.160
AND BY THAT,
OBVIOUSLY I MEAN,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.509
I'VE BEEN MURDERED.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.077
- YOU SAID "I'VE" AGAIN.
- I KNOW.

08:34.110 --> 08:37.602
- ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

09:01.440 --> 09:03.829
- FIND ME A CLUE, SHAWN.
FIND ME A CLUE NOW.

09:03.870 --> 09:05.838
- DUDE, THERE ARE NO CLUES.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.735
AND I CAN'T JUST MAKE STUFF UP.
- THAT'S ALL YOU EVER DO.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.179
- I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT'S ALL I EVER DO.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.848
I MEAN, HAVE A GIFT
OF SORTS--OW!

09:10.880 --> 09:12.973
- YOU OWE ME, SHAWN.
- OKAY, OKAY, FINE, FINE.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.647
HEY, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.
I HAVE A THING.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.183
- EVERYBODY,
LISTEN TO SHAWN.

09:17.220 --> 09:21.611
- UH, THIS MAN
IS NOT THE FACELESS COG

09:21.660 --> 09:23.218
THAT HE SO CLEARLY
APPEARED TO BE,

09:23.260 --> 09:24.682
REGARDLESS OF
YOUR VANTAGE POINT.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.652
- NOPE.
- TO THE UNTRAINED EYE,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.827
WHAT MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE
THE FINAL DESPERATE ACT

09:28.860 --> 09:30.327
OF A FORGE'I'TABLE DRONE--
YOU KNOW,

09:30.370 --> 09:34.431
HIM SNUFFING OUT THE LIGHT
OF HIS DISMAL,

09:34.470 --> 09:38.429
LOVELESS, EARTH-TON ED. . .
FAILURE OF A LIFE--

09:38.470 --> 09:40.233
- GET TO THE POINT.
- IT WAS, IN FACT,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.999
WAIT FOR IT...

09:43.050 --> 09:46.770
MURDER.
- [gasp5]

09:46.820 --> 09:47.673
- AND WE'RE DONE HERE.
- YEP.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.245
THAN KS, GUYS.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.054
- DUDE, RENAISSANCE FEST
NEXT SATURDAY.

09:53.090 --> 09:56.218
THE RENAISSANCE FEST
FOR NEXT SATURDAY.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.080
- WHOA, HO, HO, HO,
WAIT A SECOND.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.654
I AM SENSING
THAT JOHN RUSSELL

09:59.700 --> 10:02.760
MADE PLANS TO ATTEND
AN EVENT IN THE FUTURE,

10:02.800 --> 10:06.258
NEXT WEEKEND, THAT HE KNEW
HE WOULD NOT LIVE TO SEE.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.268
NOW,
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,

10:08.300 --> 10:09.699
DON'T WE THINK?
- [scoffing laugh]

10:09.740 --> 10:12.163
- IN CONCLUSION,
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SAY

10:12.210 --> 10:14.576
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE,
THOUGH NOT PROBABLE,

10:14.610 --> 10:19.377
THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
THIS WAS, IN FACT, MURDER.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.469
- [gasp5]
- THOUGH PROBABLY NOT.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.839
SLIGHTLY.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.348
- MY GOLLY,
THAT WAS SO COMPELLING.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.415
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SWAYED ME.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.950
HERE YOU GO, HARDY BOYS,
GO INVESTIGATE.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.151
- OOH, YES.
- BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING A DIME.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.021
- NO.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.195
- LET'S CATCH US A KILLER.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.268
[hums]

10:46.310 --> 10:48.232
- COME ON, MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.646
- I'M GETTING MY HEAD RIGHT
BEFORE WE INVESTIGATE, SHAWN.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.774
IF THERE'S MURDERER IN HERE,
I'M GONNA FIND HIM.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.640
- OH, YEAH?
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S A HE?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.080
- IT'S SEMANTICS, SHAWN.
- IT'S NOT SEMANTICS.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.156
WHO'S GONNA PAY US FOR THIS?
- THE UNIVERSE.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.078
- MAN,
THAT IS NOT A THING.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.759
[elevator bell clings]
- YES, IT IS.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.196
- WHY ARE WE
AT YOUR OFFICE?

11:12.230 --> 11:13.697
- THIS IS NOT MY OFFICE.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.958
I WORK AT CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.309
THIS IS CALIFORNIA COAST
INSURANCE.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.432
MILLI WAS NOT VANILLI.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.370
- [gasp5]
WHAT?

11:24.780 --> 11:26.714
- I KNOW WHAT GOES ON
IN OFFICES.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.844
EVERYONE IS A SUSPECT.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.512
[both laughing]

11:34.560 --> 11:37.484
- IT'S LIKE RUSS'S DEATH
HAD NO EFFECT ON THESE PEOPLE.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.192
- WHO'S RUSS?
- I MEANT RUSSELL.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.390
JOHN RUSSELL.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.261
[both laughing]

11:43.300 --> 11:47.236
- [laughs mockingly]

11:47.270 --> 11:50.364
HAVING FUN.
- EXCUSE ME?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.013
- IS THAT YOUR YOGURT?

12:00.050 --> 12:01.870
- I'M EATING IT,
AREN'T I?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.243
- REALLY?

12:05.290 --> 12:07.815
ARE YOU EATING
A DEAD MAN'S YOGURT?

12:07.860 --> 12:11.125
- RELAX. I DIDN'T THINK
HE NEEDED IT ANYMORE.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.798
BESIDES, IT EXPIRES
IN THREE DAYS.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.298
- THREE DAYS?
THREE DAYS?

12:15.330 --> 12:17.366
WOULD YOU DO IF THAT
WAS JESUS'S YOGURT?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.389
- GUS.
- WHAT?

12:18.430 --> 12:19.624
- NO.
- WHERE WERE YOU

12:19.670 --> 12:21.069
LAST NIGHT AT 10:00 P.M.?
- HOME.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.260
- WAS THAT BEFORE
OR AFTER

12:22.300 --> 12:24.063
YOU MURDERED JOHN RUSSELL?
- WHAT?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.463
- WHAT IS THIS COMMOTION?
- I'M SORRY, WE'RE ACT UALLY--

12:25.510 --> 12:27.171
- WE'RE WITH THE SBPD,

12:27.210 --> 12:28.404
AND WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

12:28.440 --> 12:30.203
REGARDING THE MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES

12:30.250 --> 12:33.742
SURROUNDING THE DEATH
OF JOHN RUSSELL.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.714
- YEAH.
THAT'S--THAT'S RIGHT.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.446
- OF COURSE.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.750
- JOHN WAS
OUR TOP SALES REP.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.655
HE WAS RELIABLY EFFICIENT.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.123
HE'D BEEN WITH US
FOR 15 YEARS.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.720
HE HAD 113 UNUSED
VACATION DAYS.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.397
- HEY, THAT'S HOW MANY
GUS HAS.

12:52.430 --> 12:53.795
- I HAVE 111.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.489
- HE WAS A NICE FELLA.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.598
[phone vibrating]

12:56.640 --> 12:57.868
A LITTLE DULL.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.071
- OH, NO.
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.874
- NO, MR. LATREK--MR. GROUSE.
CONTINUE.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.309
- WELL, WHEN I FOUND OUT
IT WAS A SUICIDE,

13:04.350 --> 13:06.045
I CAN'T SAY
I WAS SURPRISED.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.275
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH
OF A LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.912
- MM, THAT'S NOT
ACTUALLY TRUE.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.612
IN FACT, HE HAD A VERY FULL
AND EXCITING LIFE.

13:12.650 --> 13:14.083
- HE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.451
- HE WAS BETWEEN
RELATIONSHIPS.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.754
BUT HE WAS VERY SOUGHT-AFTER,
VERY SEXY.

13:17.790 --> 13:18.859
- GUS.
- WHAT?

13:18.890 --> 13:21.654
- NO.
- A VERY SEXY MAN.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.520
- IF YOU SAY SO.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.128
DO YOU THINK THAT FOUL PLAY
MIGHT'VE BEEN INVOLVED?

13:25.170 --> 13:26.728
- NO.
- YES.

13:26.770 --> 13:28.237
THINGS ARE DEFINITELY POINTING
IN THAT DIRECTION.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.692
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
HE SEEMED SO...

13:29.740 --> 13:31.708
[phone chimes]
YOU KNOW, ANONYMOUS.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.879
- HMM.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.605
ALL RIGHT, UH,
MR. GROUSE,

13:35.640 --> 13:37.198
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY

13:37.250 --> 13:38.706
ABOUT JOHN
BEFORE HE DIED?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.012
- WELL, HE HAD BEEN LATE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.278
THAT WAS UNUSUAL,
BUT I LET IT SLIDE.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.673
HE WAS MY TOP GUY.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.483
AND HE ONLY MADE
48K A YEAR.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.318
- $48,000?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.987
- TAX-FREE?
- NO.

13:49.020 --> 13:49.987
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FILL THAT POSITION, RIGHT?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.520
I MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO REPLACE HIM.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.050
- WE'LL PROMOTE FROM WITHIN.
- OOH.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.295
YOU THINK
THAT'S THE BEST IDEA?

13:55.330 --> 13:58.424
BECAUSE I CAN COME IN HERE
AND I CAN BE REFRESHING

13:58.470 --> 14:02.338
AND I CAN SEE THINGS
WITH FRESH EYES FOR YOU.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.338
SCAPE IT UP.
- UH-HUH.

14:04.370 --> 14:05.837
WILL THERE
BE ANYTHING ELSE?

14:05.870 --> 14:08.100
- OOH.
MAY I KEEP THIS?

14:08.140 --> 14:10.472
- NO, IT WAS A GIFT.
- MM.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.808
- OOH.
HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:12.850 --> 14:14.772
- NO.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.549
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE--

14:18.350 --> 14:20.511
- SPITE YOUR FACE.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.256
- [scoffs]

14:23.290 --> 14:24.587
- THAT GUY NEEDS
TO TURN THE PAGE

14:24.630 --> 14:25.824
TO THE 20TH CENTURY, GUS.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.327
WHAT?
IT'S A DEAD END, MAN.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.588
WHAT--AAH.

14:28.630 --> 14:31.428
UGH!

14:31.470 --> 14:33.358
- COME HERE.
- BUT--[whines]

14:33.400 --> 14:35.630
- COME HERE, MAN.
FIND ME A CLUE.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.366
FIND ME A CLUE
RIGHT NOW.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.401
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.771
- I'M SO BORED.

14:41.810 --> 14:43.346
HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THESE
ALL DAY LONG?

14:43.380 --> 14:44.449
- WRONG ANSWER, SHAWN.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.641
TRY AGAIN.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.617
- [snoring]
- SHAWN!

14:49.650 --> 14:51.515
- [gaSPSJ
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:53.590 --> 14:56.150
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
LOOK WHO IT IS.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.782
HERE FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.627
A DESK CHAIR?
A FICUS?

14:59.660 --> 15:01.594
- THAT'S A PALM,

15:01.630 --> 15:03.791
AND IF YOU MUST KNOW,
I'M TAKING JOHN'S COMPUTER.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.219
- OH, MY GOSH.

15:06.270 --> 15:08.659
- LOOK, I'M THE NUMBER-TWO GUY,
AND I HAD DIBS.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.463
MY COMPUTER IS, LIKE,
TEN YEARS OLD.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.501
- HELLS NAW.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.700
- GUS.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.503
N--UGH.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.599
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE,
HE'S A LITTLE, UH--

15:17.650 --> 15:19.902
GUS!

15:19.950 --> 15:22.669
- PEOPLE OF CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS--

15:22.720 --> 15:24.449
- CALIFORNIA COAST
INSURANCE.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.550
- PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA COAST
INSURANCE,

15:27.590 --> 15:30.058
A MAN HAS DIED,

15:30.090 --> 15:33.799
A MAN YOU'VE WORKED
SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH FOR 15 YEARS,

15:33.830 --> 15:36.219
YET TO WALK AMONGST YOU,
YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.820
WHERE ARE THE FLOWERS,
THE TEARS?

15:38.870 --> 15:40.599
WHERE ARE THE HUSHED TONES

15:40.640 --> 15:42.039
AND THE KEENING WAILS
OF THE BEREAVED?

15:42.070 --> 15:45.665
OH, FOR SHAME.
WHAT IS A MAN'S LIFE WORTH?

15:45.710 --> 15:48.838
JUST SOMETHING TO BE STRIPPED
FOR PARTS ONCE HE'S GONE?

15:48.880 --> 15:51.007
RUSS WAS ONE OF YOU.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.574
- WHO'S RUSS?

15:52.610 --> 15:56.011
- DON'T.
JUST LET IT--

15:56.050 --> 15:59.508
- WELL, MR. YOPLAIT-ER,

15:59.550 --> 16:01.188
MAYBE IF YOU'D BOTHERED
TO GET TO KNOW THE MAN,

16:01.220 --> 16:02.949
YOU WOULD HAVE GROWN
CLOSE ENOUGH TO ENJOY

16:02.990 --> 16:06.357
THE INTIMACY
OF A NICKNAME.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.620
A MAN HAS DIED,

16:08.660 --> 16:10.764
AND YOU MUST AT LEAST
LET HIS HARD DRIVE COOL

16:10.800 --> 16:13.689
BEFORE YOU MAY CLAIM
HIS COMPUTER AS YOUR OWN.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.062
- WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT A COMPUTER, QUAN?

16:17.110 --> 16:20.034
- I CALLED DIBS
ON JOHN'S COMPUTER.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.537
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE NEEDS IT.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.340
[all struggling]

16:25.380 --> 16:26.574
- WOULD YOU COOL DOWN!
- GET OFF ME.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.714
- EASY THERE, DENZEL.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.388
LITTLE MORE MIGHTY QUINN,
A LITTLE LESS TRAINING DAY.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.149
- LEAVE JOHN'S STUFF ALONE,
ALL RIGHT, QUAN?

16:32.190 --> 16:33.748
LET'S HAVE SOME RESPECT.

16:33.790 --> 16:36.611
AND YOU TWO,
I TALKED TO THE SBPD.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.389
THEY SAY YOU DON'T
WORK FOR THEM.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.455
- OH, THEY'RE THIS CLOSE
TO HIRING US.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.922
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF PAPERWORK, REALLY.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.496
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU BOTH TO LEAVE.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.862
- YES, MR. LATREK.
- THE NAME'S GROUSE.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.437
- YES, SIR.

16:50.570 --> 16:51.969
- I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO WORK IN INSURANCE.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.535
RUMINATE ON THAT.

16:58.110 --> 16:59.668
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU, MAN?

16:59.710 --> 17:00.870
YOU'RE TAKING THIS
VERY PERSONALLY.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.273
- [whispering]
CHECK IT OUT.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.685
I STOLE IT
OFF OF THE JANITOR'S CART.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.585
WE ARE SNEAKING BACK IN TONIGHT.

17:05.620 --> 17:06.917
- WAIT, BUT YOU
DON'T STEAL KEY CARDS.

17:06.950 --> 17:08.417
THAT'S NOT YOUR THING.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.449
- I'VE NEVER BEEN MURDERED
BEFORE.

17:09.490 --> 17:12.425
IT'S LIBERATING.

17:18.830 --> 17:22.095
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.767
I DO NOT LIKE THIS.
IT FEELS WRONG.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.801
- YOU DO THIS KIND OF STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.637
- YEAH, BUT NOW YOU'RE DOING IT.
IT'S TOTALLY THROWING ME OFF.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.534
I'M GOING TO START
SAYING STUFF LIKE "HURRY UP"

17:29.580 --> 17:30.808
AND "BE CAREFUL."

17:30.850 --> 17:31.976
- I'M IN.
- GET OUTTA HERE.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.639
- WHAT?
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.908
LET'S SEE.

17:36.950 --> 17:38.349
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.812
THAT EMAIL CAME IN
AFTER HE DIED.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.613
- IT'S ADDRESSED
TO DR. ALAN CHAMPION

17:41.660 --> 17:43.651
FROM ANGELA BENNETT.
- SO?

17:43.690 --> 17:45.419
- DUDE, THAT'S SANDY BULLOCK
AND DENNIS MILLER'S NAMES

17:45.460 --> 17:46.779
FROM THE MOVIE

THAT MAKES YOU "EM."

27:24.270 --> 27:25.168
- EMMANUELLE.
GIMME THAT--

27:25.210 --> 27:26.700
- NAH.
- H00 H00.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.833
- IT'S NOT GOING DOWN LIKE THAT.
GUNS FIRST.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.144
- OH, SO SHORTY GOT ICE WATER
IN HIS VEINS NOW, HUH?

27:31.180 --> 27:33.148
- LIKE A CHILLED MARTINI.
COOL, YET UNMISTAKABLY--

27:33.180 --> 27:34.215
- GUS.
- WHAT?

27:34.250 --> 27:36.013
- IT'S TOO MUCH.
- WHAT?

27:36.050 --> 27:37.347
- LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
JUST COMPARE RATES ON EXPEDIA

27:37.380 --> 27:38.312
AND GET A ROOM ALREADY.

27:38.350 --> 27:39.339
- MAN!

27:39.390 --> 27:41.153
I HAVE ASTIGMATISM TOO.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.282
- SHUT UP.
[phone buzzing]

27:42.320 --> 27:44.288
- OKAY,
MY BUTT IS VIBRATING.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.059
THAT MEANS
I'M GONNA CHECK MY PHONE.

27:46.090 --> 27:48.729
EASY, EASY.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.066
TALK TO ME, WOODY.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.568
- [sniffs]

27:53.600 --> 27:55.192
- HUH.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.332
WOODY FOUND EVIDENCE
THAT JOHN RUSSELL

27:56.370 --> 27:58.565
WAS FORCE-FED THOSE PILLS.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.259
GUS, YOU WERE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, MAN.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.778
THIS IS NOT A SUICIDE.

28:02.810 --> 28:03.947
- JOHN RUSSELL'S DEAD?

28:03.980 --> 28:07.006
- WELCOME TO THE NAH.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.612
- WHY WAS JOHN GIVING YOU
A DEATH CERTIFICATE

28:10.650 --> 28:12.117
FOR PONY WAYNE WHITE?

28:12.150 --> 28:12.889
- I THINK
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO

28:12.920 --> 28:13.909
WITH INSURANCE FRAUD.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.018
THAT'S WHY HE HIRED ME.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.709
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME MUCH MORE,

28:16.760 --> 28:18.284
SAID HE WANTED TO DO
SOME LEGWORK ON HIS OWN.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.422
I WOULD FOLLOW HIM
AND TAKE PICTURES

28:19.460 --> 28:20.791
IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.919
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT I AM.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.665
SO IS THIS YOUR CAR?

28:26.700 --> 28:27.928
- NO, THIS IS A COMPANY CAR.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.892
GUS IS A PHARMACEUTICAL REP.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.464
- IT'S MY DAY JOB.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.307
BEING AN INVESTIGATOR'S
MY REAL PASSION.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.637
- WHAT'S YOUR DAY JOB?
- [chuckles]

28:34.680 --> 28:36.898
HIS DAY JOB
IS ME WORKING MY DAY JOB.

28:36.940 --> 28:40.444
- YEAH, BUT I'M THINKING
ABOUT TAKING WORK AS A "MANNY."

28:40.480 --> 28:42.675
I'M GONNA APPLY
FOR THIS GIG.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.814
- OKAY, THIS IS FOR SOMEONE
LOOKING TO GET HIRED AS A NANNY,

28:45.850 --> 28:47.386
NOT HIRE ONE.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.354
- WHAT?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.655
- I CALL SHOTGUN
NEXT TIME WE'RE IN THE CAR.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.749
- [laughs]
NAH.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.324
I DON'T SIT BACK THERE.
THE DOORS DON'T WORK.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.827
- TOO BAD, I CALLED IT.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.362
- WELL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- SHE JUST DID.

29:07.670 --> 29:10.468
- PONY WAYNE WHITE?
YEAH, I KNOW THAT NAME.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.977
I JUST DID AN AUTOPSY ON HIM
LAST WEEK,

29:12.010 --> 29:13.773
BUT THIS SAYS
HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR TWO MONTHS.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.515
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT, CAN IT?

29:15.550 --> 29:16.847
I MEAN, I THINK
I'D NOTICE IF A BODY

29:16.880 --> 29:18.689
HAD BEEN DEAD
FOR TWO MONTHS.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.086
THE SMELL ALONE, YEAH.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.157
- WHO ARE YOU?
- WHO ARE YOU?

29:24.190 --> 29:26.283
- I'M DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.854
- YEAH, WELL, SO WHAT?
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.754
THIS SAYS "CAUSE OF DEATH:
CARDIAC ARREST."

29:29.800 --> 29:31.358
- YEAH, SURE,
IF CARDIAC ARREST

29:31.400 --> 29:32.992
PUTS GRAPEFRUIT-SIZED HOLES
IN YOUR CHEST.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.066
SEE, HERE'S THE DEATH
CERTIFICATE I SIGNED LAST WEEK.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.489
"CAUSE OF DEATH:
GUNSHOTS TO THE CHESTY AREA."

29:37.540 --> 29:39.269
- I REMEMBER THIS GUY.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.561
HE WAS KILLED TRYING TO ROB
A SHOOTING RANGE,

29:40.610 --> 29:42.009
WHICH JUST PROVES
THAT DARWIN WAS RIGHT.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.144
- AND THERE'S MY SIGNATURE.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.311
- I THINK THAT'S A FORGE.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.682
- UH, WHY WOULD I FORGE
MY OWN SIGNATURE, SHAWN?

29:52.720 --> 29:54.654
- NO, NO, WOODY, NOT THAT ONE.
THIS ONE HERE.

29:54.690 --> 29:55.987
I THINK SOMEONE
TOOK YOUR SIGNATURE

29:56.020 --> 29:57.783
AND THEN DREW OVER IT.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.786
YOU SEE, EMMANUELLE,
I'M A PSYCHIC.

29:59.830 --> 30:01.354
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- MY GOD.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.459
I FEEL SO VIOLATED,
EMMANUELLE.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.661
AND YET, IN A WEIRD WAY,
FLATTERED.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.294
- MM.
SO SOMEONE--

30:08.340 --> 30:09.762
- FORGED AN OFFICIAL
DEATH CERTIFICATE

30:09.800 --> 30:11.301
FOR PONY WAYNE WHITE
TWO MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED?

30:11.340 --> 30:12.568
- UNLESS THERE'S--
- UNLESS THERE ARE

30:12.610 --> 30:13.929
TWO PONY WAYNE WHITES,
THIS COULD BE

30:13.980 --> 30:15.504
THE INSURANCE FRAUD
JOHN WAS INVESTIGATING.

30:15.540 --> 30:16.632
- LOOK, WE SHOULD--
- WE SHOULD CHECK OUT

30:16.680 --> 30:17.578
THE WHITE HOUSE.
- YES.

30:17.610 --> 30:18.770
_ WH--

30:18.810 --> 30:20.914
UH, UH, WHAT?

30:20.950 --> 30:22.838
YEAH,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

30:22.880 --> 30:25.417
[chuckles]
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I GOTTA GO.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.918
SOMEONE HAS TO LEAD.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.383
I HAVE A STANDING "SHOTGUN"
IN THIS VEHICLE,

30:30.420 --> 30:32.854
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT!

30:32.890 --> 30:35.825
GUS, IS THAT
AN OLD FRENCH FRY?

30:35.860 --> 30:39.694
I AM IN A METAL CAGE
OF DESPAIR!

30:39.730 --> 30:43.564
- THIS IS IT.
PONY WAYNE WHITE'S.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.404
- HEY, GUYS, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO OPEN MY DOOR

30:50.440 --> 30:51.873
FROM THE OUTS--

30:51.910 --> 30:53.468
- MRS. WHITE?

30:53.510 --> 30:54.943
- MAYBE.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.914
- MY NAME IS EMMANUELLE,
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER,

30:56.950 --> 30:59.248
DENZEL DIGGS UNDERWOOD
MORRIS CHESTNUT WASHINGTON.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.508
- I CAN HEAR YOU.
THAT IS MY BIT.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.788
- WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.584
- OH, HE JUST OPENED UP
A CLUB FOR LADIES.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.053
YOU KNOW, WHERE FELLAS SHAKE IT
FOR MONEY AND WHATNOT.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.853
- WELL, ARE THEY HIRING?
BECAUSE I COULD USE THE WORK.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.822
AND I'LL SHAKE MY JUNK
ANY OLD PLACE.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.394
- SORRY FOR ASKING,
BUT HOW DID HE AFFORD

31:14.440 --> 31:15.532
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

31:15.570 --> 31:16.867
- HE TOOK A LOAN,

31:16.900 --> 31:18.663
WOULDN'T SAY FROM WHO.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.530
COULDN'T GO TO NO BANK,
NOT WITH HIS RECORD.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.777
'COURSE, THE INTEREST
IS REAL HIGH.

31:22.810 --> 31:24.505
- WELL, DID PONY
HAVE LIFE INSURANCE?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.575
- YEAH, BUT WHEN
I TRIED TO COLLECT,

31:26.610 --> 31:29.773
THEY SAYS PONY DIED OF
A HEART ATTACK TWO MONTHS AGO.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.082
- DID YOU EVER MEET A GUY
NAMED JOHN RUSSELL?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.714
- YEAH, HE WAS GONNA
LOOK INTO IT FOR ME.

31:33.750 --> 31:36.810
THEN SOME OTHER GUY CALLS,
SAYS IT'S HIS CASE NOW.

31:36.860 --> 31:38.782
THAT'S THE LAST I HEARD
FROM ANYBODY.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.752
- I THINK I KNOW
WHO THAT GUY IS.

31:40.790 --> 31:43.998
THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

31:44.030 --> 31:46.567
- MESSED UP, YOU GUYS
LEAVING ME IN HERE LIKE THAT.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.091
I AM NOT A CHILD!

31:50.870 --> 31:53.236
- WHAT DO YOU THINK QUAN'S
DOING HERE BY HIMSELF?

31:53.270 --> 31:56.376
- AND WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

32:02.950 --> 32:05.714
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.981
LOOKS LIKE YOU AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION.

32:11.160 --> 32:16.257
[cracking knuckles]

32:18.600 --> 32:22.297
QUAN DIDN'T DO IT,
BUT HE MIGHT HAVE A LEAD.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.735
- JOHN DISCOVERED SOME SKETCHY
PAYOUTS FROM THE COMPANY,

32:27.770 --> 32:29.431
BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANY MORE.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.505
- THAT MUST BE WHY
YOU WANTED HIS COMPUTER.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.949
- I FIGURED
THIS WAS MY CHANCE

32:32.980 --> 32:34.811
SINCE WE GET A HALF DAY
FOR JOHN'S FUNERAL.

32:34.850 --> 32:36.579
- SEE, MAN, QUAN'S A GOOD DUDE.
HE'S TRYING TO HELP OUT.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.941
- STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
THE YOGURT.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.617
- I STILL CAN'T ACCESS
TH ESE ACCOUNTS.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.686
THEY'RE PASSWORD PROTECTED,
WHICH IS WEIRD.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.982
- MAN, WATCH OUT.
WATCH OUT.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.328
- JUST CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.159
- THAT'S
WHAT I KEEP GETTING.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.849
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THE CODE MAY BE?

32:50.900 --> 32:53.619
- THERE'S, LIKE, 17,000
POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.696
- TRY "A-D-B," OR "B-D-A,"
OR "B-A-D."

32:56.740 --> 32:58.560
[keyboard clacks]

32:58.610 --> 33:00.635
- I'M IN.
- I GOT IT RIGHT, DIDN'T I?

33:00.670 --> 33:03.207
- NO, I FOUND A BACK DOOR
INTO THE SYSTEM.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.673
- JUST LIKE IN THE NET.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.268
- HEY.
- WHAT?

33:06.310 --> 33:08.175
- ALL RIGHT.
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.011
PRINT IT ALL.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.314
- [whispering]
HURRY UP.

33:13.350 --> 33:17.059
- NICE TO SEE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER, MR. RUSSELL.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.757
- WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, JULES,

33:23.800 --> 33:25.427
IF WE ACTUALLY GET PAID
FOR THIS,

33:25.470 --> 33:26.823
YOU'RE GETTING A TASTE,
OKAY?

33:26.870 --> 33:28.895
NO, I INSIST.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.794
NOW, TELL ME ALL ABOUT FLORIDA.
START AT THE BEGINNING.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.137
WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY, HEY!
SHOTGUN, SHOTGUN!

33:32.170 --> 33:34.070
- HEY, I CALLED IT
IN THE ELEVATOR.

33:34.110 --> 33:35.873
- NO, YOU CANNOT CALL SHOTGUN
BEFORE YOU EVEN SEE THE CAR.

33:35.910 --> 33:37.605
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
- I DON'T CARE.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.039
IT'S NOT FAIR,
AND I'M MAD AS HELL!

33:39.080 --> 33:40.547
- FINE,
WE CAN CALL IT ON THREE.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.514
ONE, TWO--

33:42.550 --> 33:44.484
[gunshot]

33:50.960 --> 33:52.723
all: SHOTGUN!

33:52.760 --> 33:54.648
- SHAWN,
GET LASSIE ON THE PHONE.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.793
AND MAKE SURE SHE'S SAFE.
I'LL KEEP HIM OCCUPIED.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.092
- HEY, GUS, BE CAREFUL.

33:58.130 --> 34:00.325
- DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO BE.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.162

36:09.630 --> 36:11.029

36:11.060 --> 36:12.493
- DON'T SHOOT HIM!
HE'S JUST A KID!

36:12.530 --> 36:14.066
- I DID IT.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.091
I DID IT.
OH.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.529
DUDE, I DID IT.

36:18.570 --> 36:19.707

36:19.740 --> 36:22.300
- YEAH, YOU DID--
- OH, GUS.

36:22.340 --> 36:25.275
- WELL, WE ALL SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.844
- NO, IT WAS A GIFT.

36:33.890 --> 36:36.711
- WHY IS THERE
A PICTURE OF US, GUS?

36:38.190 --> 36:40.055
THIS GUY'S
JUST THE TRIGGER MAN.

36:40.090 --> 36:43.150
I KNOW WHO KILLED
JOHN RUSSELL!

36:43.200 --> 36:44.360
AND I KNOW
WHO HE WAS WORKING FOR!

36:44.400 --> 36:45.890
- LET'S GO GET HIM.

36:45.930 --> 36:46.897
- LASSIE,
WE'RE GONNA NEED A RIDE.

36:46.930 --> 36:48.761

36:48.800 --> 36:50.859
- DAMN IT!

36:50.900 --> 36:54.108
- WHAT CAN YOU SAY
ABOUT JOHN?

36:54.140 --> 36:58.099
NUMBER-ONE SALES REP.
RELIABLY EFFICIENT.

36:58.140 --> 37:02.076
HE WILL BE MISSED.
WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK?

37:02.120 --> 37:04.987
- I WOULD.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.511
JOHN RUSSELL WAS A COG,

37:07.550 --> 37:13.284
A FACELESS, NAMELESS,
"RELIABLY EFFICIENT" COG.

37:13.330 --> 37:15.093
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

37:15.130 --> 37:17.519
THIS WORLD WAS BUILT
OFF OF THE SWEAT,

37:17.560 --> 37:19.460
TOIL, AND DEDICATION
OF COGS.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.388
IF WE DO OUR JOB RIGHT,

37:21.440 --> 37:23.692
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT WE'RE THERE.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.799
AND THAT'S THE WAY
WE LIKE IT.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.809
YOU SEE,
COGS THRIVE ON ORDER,

37:28.840 --> 37:31.070
BUT SOMETHING
WAS OUT OF ORDER

37:31.110 --> 37:33.806
AT CENTRAL COAST
PHARMACEUTICALS.

37:33.850 --> 37:34.748
both: CALIFORNIA COAST
INSURANCE.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.940
- COME ON, SON.

37:35.980 --> 37:39.347
- CALIFORNIA COAST
INSURANCE.

37:39.390 --> 37:44.521
SOMETHING MAKING IT HARD
OUT THERE FOR A COG.

37:44.560 --> 37:48.348
YOU SEE, SOMEBODY
WAS GIVING LOANS TO BAD PEOPLE

37:48.400 --> 37:50.220
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A CUT OF THE ACTION.

37:50.260 --> 37:53.195
A COP WOULD CALL THAT PERSON
A LOAN SHARK.

37:53.230 --> 37:56.631
BUT JOHN RUSSELL
USED TO CALL HIM HIS BOSS.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.069
- WHAT?

37:58.100 --> 38:00.000
- MR. GROUSE PAID OUT
DEATH BENEFITS

38:00.040 --> 38:01.735
TO PEOPLE
WHO WERE STILL ALIVE.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.772
- HE TOOK A LOAN,
WOULDN'T SAY FROM WHO.

38:04.810 --> 38:06.471
COULDN'T GO TO NO BANK,
NOT WITH HIS RECORD.

38:06.510 --> 38:08.000
- ELABORATE STUFF TOO.

38:08.050 --> 38:09.915
DEATH CERTIFICATES,
THE WHOLE BIT.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.009
- HERE'S THE DEATH CERTIFICATE
I SIGNED LAST WEEK.

38:12.050 --> 38:14.484
"CAUSE OF DEATH:
GUNSHOTS TO THE CHESTY AREA."

38:14.520 --> 38:16.454
- DID YOU KNOW THAT
SOME OF THE WORST ESTABLISHMENTS

38:16.490 --> 38:19.721
IN SANTA BARBARA
ARE OWNED BY DEAD PEOPLE?

38:19.760 --> 38:21.250
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
HE'S LYING.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.155
- OOH!

38:23.200 --> 38:27.159
PONY WAYNE WHITE OPENED UP
PONY'S: THE MANE EVENT--

38:27.200 --> 38:29.464
SPELLED "M-A-N-E"--

38:29.500 --> 38:31.866
AFTER HE SUFFERED
A FATAL HEART ATTACK

38:31.910 --> 38:34.731
WITH A LOAN THAT HE RECEIVED
FROM MR. GROUSE.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.270
[chuckles]

38:36.310 --> 38:39.006
NOW, THAT'S
ONE ENTREPRENEURIAL ZOMBIE.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.268
- THESE PEOPLE KNOW ME, OKAY?
THEY TRUST ME.

38:41.310 --> 38:44.017
- EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE,

38:44.050 --> 38:46.814
BUT THEN PONY HAD TO GO
AND DIE FOR REAL.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.010
AND WHEN JOHN RUSSELL
DISCOVERED

38:48.050 --> 38:49.881
THAT SOMETHING FUNNY
WAS GOING ON...

38:49.920 --> 38:51.820
- JOHN DISCOVERED SOME SKETCHY
PAYOUTS FROM THE COMPANY,

38:51.860 --> 38:53.088
BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANY MORE.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.325
- GROUSE DECIDED
IT WAS TIME THAT JOHN

38:55.360 --> 38:58.090
FINALLY TOOK HIS VACATION--
A PERMANENT ONE.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.961
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
YOU--YOU CAN'T PROVE THIS.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.935
- MAN, I ALREADY HAVE.

39:02.970 --> 39:04.904
- ALL RIGHT, GROUSE,
LET'S GO.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.928
- [grunts]

39:08.980 --> 39:10.538
AH!

39:11.750 --> 39:13.502
- SUMBITCH.

39:13.550 --> 39:16.041
- SO WHO DO I TALK TO
ABOUT GETTING YOUR JOB?

39:16.080 --> 39:18.014
- WHAT?

39:19.690 --> 39:22.352
- JOHN RUSSELL THOUGHT
THAT DOING THE RIGHT THING

39:22.390 --> 39:24.585
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN DOING THE SAFE THING.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.258
HE MAY HAVE
LIVED HIS LIFE AS A COG,

39:27.290 --> 39:29.724
BUT HE DIED A HERO.

39:31.800 --> 39:37.693
[light applause]

39:39.070 --> 39:41.573
- THAT MAN IS SEXY.
- MM.

39:41.610 --> 39:43.100
HE GETS IT FROM ME.

39:43.140 --> 39:44.869
- I DON'T THINK SO.

39:48.110 --> 39:51.011
[cool rock music]

39:51.050 --> 39:57.011
*

40:16.810 --> 40:22.749
[echoing thuds]

40:32.760 --> 40:35.991
- YOU KNOW,
THIS BUFFET ISN'T THAT BAD.

40:36.030 --> 40:37.395
- HEY, WELL,
CONSIDER THIS ON ME,

40:37.430 --> 40:39.193
NOW THAT YOU'RE
GAINFULLY UNEMPLOYED.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.118
- [scoffs]
NO, NO, NO, I GOT IT.

40:41.170 --> 40:44.503
I'M DEBT FREE, AND I HAVE
AN EMERGENCY FUND EARNING 1.25%.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.361
I'M GOOD, AT LEAST FOR
THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX MONTHS.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.275
- WELL, HERE'S TO THE NEXT
FOUR TO SIX MONTHS.

40:49.310 --> 40:51.073
- [laughs]

40:51.110 --> 40:54.614
- I MUST BREAK YOU...

40:54.650 --> 40:57.744
WITH A COUPLE OF
VERY REFRESHING VODKA BEVERAGES.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.441
BUT THIS IS NOT
THE GOOD STUFF, YOU GUYS.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.082
- LOOK AT YOU,
EARNING YOUR MONTHLY NUT.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.212
WHAT?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.454
- OH, IT'S ONLY PART TIME.

41:03.490 --> 41:05.219
BUT I GOTTA ADMIT,
IT FEELS GOOD.

41:05.260 --> 41:07.455
BRINGING HOME THE BACON,
SMACKIN' IT,

41:07.490 --> 41:08.696
FLIPPIN' IT, RUBBIN' IT DOWN.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.027
OH, NO.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.618
I LIKE THE BACON.
- HEY.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.763
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.995
QUITTING YOUR JOB LIKE THAT,
ALL MAN-STYLE.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.508
- MAN, LOOK, I'M DONE
WITH THE COG THING, SHAWN.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.167
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DO THE GUS THING.

41:20.210 --> 41:21.609
- I'LL SAY THIS MUCH.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.335
I AM GONNA PUT IN
A GOOD WORD WITH VLAD

41:23.380 --> 41:24.472
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO START WORKING AGAIN.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.375
- MM.
- I GOTTA TELL YOU GUYS.

41:26.410 --> 41:29.140
WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE
IS BUILD AN AMAZING TEAM.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.772
GROUND FLOOR,
GRASS ROOTS.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.414
I MEAN, YOU WORK CLOSELY
WITH PEOPLE, YOU LEARN THINGS,

41:33.450 --> 41:35.657
LIKE THEIR NAMES,
AND IT'S NICE, AND IT'S RICH.

41:35.690 --> 41:38.215
- SHAWN, YOU'VE HAD THIS JOB
FOR, LIKE, 45 MINUTES.

41:38.260 --> 41:39.852
- SURE, BUT IT
DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

41:39.890 --> 41:42.791
HEY, GUYS, CHECK OUT
THIS ACTION.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.090
HUH?

41:48.130 --> 41:49.836
[both groan]

41:49.870 --> 41:51.189
- HEY!

41:51.240 --> 41:53.504
I TOLD YOU NOT THROW BOTTLES
ANYMORE.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.633
GET OUT!
YOU'RE FIRED.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.999
- COPY THAT, BIG BEAR.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.541
[chuckles]
THAT'S VLAD.

41:58.580 --> 42:02.676
WELL, I GAVE IT
THE OLD COLLEGE TRY.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.188
GUS, I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO GET YOUR JOB BACK RIGHT AWAY.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.585
- DUDE,
THAT BRIDGE IS BURNT.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.087
SECURITY HAD TO TASE ME.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.610
- [laughs]
WELL...

42:09.660 --> 42:12.151
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
WE ALWAYS DO.

42:12.190 --> 42:13.623
I'M GONNA SAY MY GOOD-BYES.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.549
HEY, ALEXYI.
ALEXY I, DON'T BE A STRANGER.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.329
- HEY, HEY.
I DON'T KNOW YOU, BUDDY. STOP!

42:18.360 --> 42:20.669
- [screams]

42:20.700 --> 42:23.669
- WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
- DO SVIDANIYA.
