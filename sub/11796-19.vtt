( bell rings )

00:04.137 --> 00:06.373
  <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
  <i>morning and the alarm</i>
  <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.406 --> 00:09.275
    <i>* I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.309 --> 00:12.379

  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:15.949

 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:15.982 --> 00:20.086
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.521 --> 00:24.991

01:22.182 --> 01:24.317
Welcome back
to Palm Desert.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.920
  Boy, there have been lots
  of surprises
  since we came here

01:26.953 --> 01:28.288
 for Jessie's father's wedding.

01:28.321 --> 01:30.123
When we first arrived,

01:30.156 --> 01:33.093
  Slater met a girl,
  but she was more
  than he had bargained for.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
  AC, l would like you
  to meet my father,

01:35.128 --> 01:37.530
   the King of Lichtenburg.

01:37.564 --> 01:40.400
 Zack: <i>Screech made</i>
<i>a major move for Lisa,</i>

01:40.433 --> 01:43.003
   <i>but she managed</i>
   <i>to s</i> i <i>destep his advances.</i>

01:46.506 --> 01:48.575
<i>Jess</i> i <i>e had a mature reaction</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:50.443
  <i>to her father marry</i> i <i>ng</i>
  <i>a younger woman.</i>

01:50.477 --> 01:53.380
 It's just a shame I'm going
 to have to stop the wedding.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.450
Two old flames
started burning

01:57.484 --> 01:59.586
 white hot
 for each other again.

02:06.559 --> 02:10.497
   ...and then Zack kissed me.
   Lisa it was so romantic.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.266
My goose-bumps
are having goose-bumps.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.301
Is there romance
brewing again?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.337
  Well, l do like Zack a lot.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.073
 Can the like,
 do you love the boy?

02:20.106 --> 02:22.108
   Lisa, I'm not
   saying any more.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.577
  You can't give me popcorn
  and say no butter.

02:25.945 --> 02:29.082
 "Once you've explored changes
 in your personality,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.651
  impress the girl
  with your physical vigor."

02:31.685 --> 02:34.954
- How do l do that, Slater?
- Easy.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.090
Watch.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.734
  Jessie, you weren't serious
  about trying to stop
  your father's wedding?

02:47.767 --> 02:50.503
  No. l was just upset
  about their age difference,

02:50.537 --> 02:52.672
 but I'll get over it.
 Don't worry.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.344
  Hi. Could you give this
  to Leslie, please?

02:57.377 --> 02:58.678
Thanks.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.282
  - Hi, Kel.
  - Hi, Zack.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.351
 "Hi, Kel"?
 "Hi, Zack"?

03:04.384 --> 03:07.320
  So are you two an item again?
  Huh, huh, are you, are you?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.522
  No, we're just gonna go
  work out together.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.558
- How about it, Kelly?
- I'd loved to.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.460
  All right.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.628
  Love, love, love,
  l knew it.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.432
  Hello, AC.

03:19.466 --> 03:23.069
 Well, greetings to you,
 Your Royal Highness.

03:23.103 --> 03:27.073
 Just call me Christina.
 Try treating me
 like any other girl.

03:27.107 --> 03:30.310
 Yeah right. No other girl
 l know owns her own country.

03:30.343 --> 03:33.646
 AC, my father wants to know if
 you'll join us
 for dinner tonight.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.716
Me? Have dinner
with the king?

03:36.750 --> 03:40.086
 - l don't know, Christina.
 - Don't worry, he'll love you.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.088
 Meet me
 in the lobby at 8:00.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.795
  Hi, everybody. Class is going
  to start in just a minute.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.231
Jessie,
I'm happy you're here.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.100
  Well, l wouldn't miss a class
  with my future stepmom.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.636
 I'm sure we'll have
 oh-so-very-much fun.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.208
   Something wrong?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.245
  Your father and
  l were gonna have
  this quiet dinner tonight,

04:05.278 --> 04:08.081
but the message
says he has to cancel.

04:08.114 --> 04:11.384
   That's just like Dad,
   always canceling.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.355
 Dad, do you think
 we could go to dinner tonight?

04:15.388 --> 04:17.724
  - Just the two of us?
  - l already have
  plans with Leslie,

04:17.757 --> 04:21.394
 - but I'd love you to join us.
 - l couldn't impose.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.364
   l mean, you never
   have time by yourselves.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.067
  Okay, you twisted my arm.
  Let's go.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.638
 Hey, look who's here.
 Hey, you two, you having fun?

04:31.671 --> 04:34.708
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Yeah. See you later.

04:34.741 --> 04:37.610
Whoa! Check out
those hot-looking guys.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.280
Kelly, you look great.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.682
 Thanks, Zack. l wore
 your favorite dress.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.618
  Hey, l think the dress
  looks better on her, Zack.

04:45.652 --> 04:49.289
- Bye, guys. See you later.
- See you later.

04:49.322 --> 04:52.192
l think there's
love in the air.
How about you?

04:52.225 --> 04:55.695
   Oh no,
   Lisa, that's my cologne,
   Musk of Mustang.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.731
Mmm, giddy-up.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.301
l wonder what's keeping
Christina.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.670
Slater, will you relax?

05:03.703 --> 05:06.272
   It takes a princess
   a long time to get ready.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.609
   - Trust me, l know.
   - Lisa, how can l relax?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.412
  It's not every day
  l eat with a king.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.081
  Look, Slater, just be
  your charming self.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.617
Be proud of your background
and who you are.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.425
 There she is.
 Wish me luck.

05:30.430 --> 05:34.134
   Well, Lisa my love,
   here we are, you and me,

05:34.167 --> 05:37.470
 me and you, the last
 two coconuts left on the tree.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.373
  - What do you say?
  - l hate coconuts.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.311
 ( whistles )

05:51.718 --> 05:55.755
  Daddy, AC is the star athlete
  at his high school.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.691
Really?

05:57.724 --> 05:59.793
  Do you play polo,
  young man?

05:59.826 --> 06:02.495
No, but l have
a lot of those shirts.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.467
 So tell me, sir,
 is Lichtenburg a big country?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.902
It's not huge.

06:08.935 --> 06:12.706
- l have three
million subjects.
- Yeah?

06:12.739 --> 06:15.842
  l only have five subjects.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.412
  You know, math,
  English, history...

06:19.446 --> 06:21.881
  So, how about them Dodgers?

06:21.915 --> 06:24.284
   Relax, AC.
   Just be yourself.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.885
  I'm trying.

06:25.919 --> 06:29.155
 Tell me about your father, AC.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.758
   - What does he do?
   - My dad?

06:31.791 --> 06:34.794
 He's in the army.
 He's a major.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.597
  l mean, a colonel.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.934
   - l mean, a general.
   - Well, which one is he?

06:40.967 --> 06:43.503
   He's all of them.
   A major-colonel-general.

06:43.536 --> 06:47.407
 - That's quite impressive.
 - Thank goodness.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.909
  - What about your mother?
  - Mom?

06:49.943 --> 06:53.346
 Just your average movie-queen-
 turned-United-States-Senator.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.548
 That's quite a family tree
 you have there.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.752
 That's only one limb.
 Let me tell you
 about my grandfather,

06:58.785 --> 07:01.121
 who owned most of California.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.660
  I'm going to splurge
  and order lobster.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.529
 This is so much fun.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.265
 What's happened to Leslie?
 It's not like her to be late.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.367
   Oh, she's probably
   busy at the spa.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.670
   All those young,
   buff guys hitting on her.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.672
 She's so nice to all of them.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.274
  David, what are you
  doing here?

07:21.307 --> 07:23.043
   Waiting for you.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.712
   But l got a message that you
   had to cancel dinner.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.747
   l never sent any message.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.749
   Strange.

07:47.567 --> 07:51.604
 "Many beauties are attracted
 to the helpless,
 goofy, saphead type."

07:51.638 --> 07:54.074
  That's me!

07:54.074 --> 07:56.609
   "First, smile
   and wait for a signal."

07:57.644 --> 08:00.046
  Oooh, hey.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.555
 It's working!

08:08.588 --> 08:10.623
  "Now tell her your name."

08:10.657 --> 08:13.460
- My name is Screech.
- I'm Melissa.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.196
  - You're cute.
  - Pay dirt!

08:16.229 --> 08:19.532
 "If she hasn't hit you,
 tell her you love her big..."

08:19.566 --> 08:21.167
  Oh!

08:23.069 --> 08:26.940
 l love your big... big nose!

08:27.040 --> 08:29.242
   - What?
   - l mean, your...

08:29.275 --> 08:31.277
   your big bottom?

08:35.381 --> 08:39.052
  Stop it!
  ( squeals )

08:39.052 --> 08:42.422
   Hey,
   Jessie, look at your father.
   Boy, is he in love.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.457
  ( shouts )

08:45.558 --> 08:48.561
 l think Leslie's making
 him look ridiculous.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.663
Jessie, l thought you
were over that.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.166
 l think it looks like fun.
 Come on, everybody.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.201
 - Come on, Zack.
 - All right.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.040
   Kelly:
   One, two, three!

09:02.475 --> 09:05.045
   PA: <i>Phone call</i>
  <i>for David Spano, line one.</i>

09:06.012 --> 09:08.014
  I'll be right back.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.219
Your father
is quite a guy.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.022
   Yeah, l guess,
   for an older man.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.125
   - Jessie, he's not that old.
   - Maybe not now.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.728
 But how are you gonna feel
 in 20 years when he's wearing

09:21.761 --> 09:25.231
 his pants up to
 his neck and you're
 still young and wrinkle free?

09:25.265 --> 09:28.568
You know,
Jessie, I'm not as bad
as you'd like me to be.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.111
Hi, AC.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.513
l haven't seen you all day.
Are you okay?

09:40.547 --> 09:43.183
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Good.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.519
 Then l would
 like you to join me
 and my father for some tennis.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.756
Christina, l...

09:49.789 --> 09:52.192
  l didn't bring my racquet.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.828
  You can borrow one
  from my father. He has 50.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.831
   He has 50 of everything.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.134
 Look, Christina, it's just not
 going to work out, okay?

10:01.167 --> 10:04.504
 - We're too different.
 - l don't understand.

10:04.537 --> 10:08.441
 l made up all that stuff about
 my family to impress you
 and your father.

10:09.509 --> 10:12.112
   I'm just an average guy.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.614
  Face it, Christina,
  l don't fit in your world.

10:14.647 --> 10:17.617
   You're caviar
   and I'm hot dogs.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.164
  Hey, Daddy.
  Let's race like we used to.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.533
  You're on.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.503
Come on, Leslie,
it's every Spano
 for themselves.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.208
   I'll start you guys off.
   All right?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.310
  - Yeah, great.
  - Wait, wait, wait.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.413
   Come on, Lisa.
   All right, on your mark.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.182
 Get set. Go!

10:49.215 --> 10:51.484
  - Lisa: Come on!
  - Zack: Go, go, go!

10:58.491 --> 11:02.195
   Boy, those Spanos sure
   take swimming seriously.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.613
Lisa:
Look at Zack and Kelly.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.550
   lf they get any closer,
   they'll be sharing shoes.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.885
Lisa, get a boyfriend!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.156
 l love this song.
 Slater, do you want to dance?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.692
No way. After what you did
to Leslie in the pool,

11:32.726 --> 11:34.594
  I'm scared of you!

11:34.627 --> 11:37.797
  Oh,
  was l too wough on the poor
  wittle aewobics instwuctor?

11:37.831 --> 11:40.667
  What's an aewobics
  instwuctor?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.470
   That was fun, but all that
   dancing made me thirsty.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.805
Yeah, me too.
Waiter!

11:45.839 --> 11:48.808
 - Hi, what would you like?
 - Uh... Coke.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.710
 And for your beautiful date?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.713
 Diet lips.
 l mean, Coke.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.819
   AC, may l speak with you?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.788
 Sure.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.726
l like you, AC.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.696
 It doesn't matter to me
 who your parents are,

12:09.729 --> 12:13.199
 or what they do.
 But if you are the kind of guy

12:13.233 --> 12:15.669
   who hides his head
   in the cement...

12:15.702 --> 12:17.804
l think you mean sand.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.940
That too.
Then go, hide,

12:20.974 --> 12:23.643
 but l hope
 your head gets stuck.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.679
   You know, we have
   a saying in our country,

12:25.712 --> 12:28.648
   "Gaveaynu Jormous
   Le Dinkenplatz."

12:28.682 --> 12:31.551
  - What does that mean?
  - It means you're a creep.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.887
   Christina, wait.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.556
   You're pretty dumb
   to be dumping a princess.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
 This creep
 has something to say.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.800
   Shookitz!
   Shookitz!

12:47.734 --> 12:51.004
 - What does that mean?
 - Wow!

12:51.104 --> 12:53.807
Come on. Let's "shookitz"
out on the dance floor.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.883
   You know, l never thought
   I'd be dating a princess.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.919
   And l never
   expected to date

13:05.952 --> 13:09.255
  a real American
  cheesecake!

13:10.223 --> 13:12.359
   That's beefcake.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.565
 Christina,
 would you be my date

13:18.598 --> 13:21.334
 at Jessie's father's wedding?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.838
 It would be an honor,
 My Lordship.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.375
   Gee, cut it out.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.680
 This is so romantic.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.816
 Yeah.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.519
  We've had fun
  together again, haven't we?

13:39.552 --> 13:42.422
   - Yeah. Fun.
   - Even though...

13:43.890 --> 13:46.426
 - Zack: Even though?
 - Kelly: Huh?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.095
   - You were saying,
   even though...?
   - l was?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.698
   It was probably nothing.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.736
  - Hi!
  - Hi, Screech. Having fun?

13:56.770 --> 13:59.873
 Not really. Lisa stuffed
 a cocktail wiener up my nose.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.941
  Cheer up, Screech.
  How about a dance?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.544
- Do you mind, Zack?
- No. Go ahead.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.785
  Looks like you and Zack
  are really hitting
  it off again, huh?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.887
   Well, actually...

14:13.920 --> 14:16.923
  l think Zack's
  getting a little
  too serious about me again.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.326
 You're not kidding.
 The guy's wacko for you, Kel.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.063
  See, Screech,
  that's the problem.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.699
 l don't want to date
 just one guy.

14:25.732 --> 14:29.336
 Oh, no! So that's why
 you wanted to dance with me?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.806
  You're cute, Kel,
  but l can't do
  that to my friend.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.608
You'll have to find someone
less desirable.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.677
   No, no, Screech.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.846
  l have to find
  a way to tell Zack

14:39.879 --> 14:41.848
that l just want
to be friends.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.084
   Don't tell him
   l told you, okay?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.997
 Okay, you two, smile!

14:58.098 --> 15:00.033
   ( camera clicks )

15:00.066 --> 15:04.037
 Jessie, lighten up.
 You look like
 your favorite whale just sank.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.706
 How can l smile knowing
 that my father's gonna marry

15:06.740 --> 15:08.775
   this gold-digging bimbo!

15:08.808 --> 15:10.944
   - Oh boy.
   - That's it. I've had it.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.413
 Ever since we met
 you have disliked me.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.449
  Oh, you're quick, too.
  At least your
  half a brain works.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.085
  You've never even given me
  a chance to be your friend.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.322
 But this is my wedding day
 and I'm not
 letting you ruin it!

15:24.791 --> 15:27.060
  Girl, we have got to talk.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.463
 Now if l were Leslie, l would
 have slapped you
 until my hand hurt,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.599
  then slapped you
  for making it hurt.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.969
  Lisa, l don't want her
  marrying my father.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.371
It's <i>not</i> your decision.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.878
  Jessie, l just saw Leslie.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.080
 l want to talk to you,
 young lady.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.383
  I'll wait outside.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.088
   Daddy, l want you
   to call off the wedding.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.624
   l don't think Leslie
   is right for you.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.928
 I'm sorry you feel that way,

16:02.028 --> 16:04.731
   but l love her,
   and she loves me.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.068
 But there are
 so many other women.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.537
   Jessie...

16:10.570 --> 16:13.473
l will always
be your father,

16:13.506 --> 16:17.043
 but you're growing up
 and you'll have your own life.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.581
l want my own life too.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.384
   I'm marrying Leslie
   and that's final.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.822
  Then l won't be there
  to see it.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.798
Hey, guys.
You look great.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.867
   - Has anyone seen Kelly?
   - Why do you ask?

16:40.900 --> 16:43.470
 After our date last night
 l realized something

16:43.503 --> 16:45.071
  and l need to talk to her.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.074
 No... l mean... why talk?
 Talking is overrated.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.677
 Let's hide somewhere
 and not talk.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.579
   - Hi, guys.
   - Yikes!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.748
 Zack, l want to talk
 to you, okay?

16:54.781 --> 16:57.817
  That's enough talk. Why don't
  you guys just
  look at each other

16:57.851 --> 16:59.853
and have
a visual relationship?

16:59.886 --> 17:01.788
  - Get off me!!
  - No, Zack.

17:01.821 --> 17:05.558
  She wants to date other guys,
  not just you. Oops.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.029
 Kelly, is that true? l mean,
 you just want to be friends?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.698
 - l hope that's okay?
 - It's great!

17:11.731 --> 17:13.366
  l was going to
  say the same thing.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.603
 See?
 l told you he'd be destroyed.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.806
   - Kelly,
   we'll always be friends.
   - Oh, good.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.708
   You guys, you guys,
   you guys!

17:21.741 --> 17:24.044
 - Jessie is not
 coming to the wedding!
 - What?

17:24.044 --> 17:26.112
She had a fight with Leslie
and her father.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.049
 She left the hotel, and she's
 heading for the bus right now.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.651
 - What are we going to do?
 - lf she misses the wedding,

17:31.685 --> 17:33.820
   she'll regret it
   for the rest of her life.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.822
 The ceremony
 starts in 30 minutes.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.657
 Whatever you do,
 stall the wedding. All right?

17:37.691 --> 17:39.893
   I'll go find her.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.797
Hello.
I'm Reverend Mitchell.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.965
 - Where's David Spano?
 - Never heard of him.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.401
l know where he is,
right this way.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.740
Yeah, me too.
Follow me, sir.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.176
  Hey, this is a formal affair.
  You forgot your tie.

18:00.413 --> 18:04.084
 Mr. Spano's a real health nut.
 I'm sure he's in here.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.654
  You said that at the tennis
  courts, the putting green,
 and the pool.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.703
Excuse me,
mind if l play through?

18:23.737 --> 18:25.905
 Go away, Zack.
 I'm not going to the wedding.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.907
 - Don't try to change my mind.
 - Okay.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.810
  lf you want to be selfish
  and ruin your
  father's big day...

18:30.844 --> 18:34.180
 Me selfish?
 He's the one who's selfish,
 marrying someone half his age.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.050
Age has nothing
to do with this.
You're jealous because

18:37.083 --> 18:40.053
you think your
father loves Leslie
more than he loves you.

18:40.053 --> 18:43.556
   - l am not!
   - Then why are
   you running away?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.959
  - Because,
  l don't like Leslie.
  - Oh yeah?

18:46.059 --> 18:48.061
 Name one thing you don't like.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.196
Well, she's...

18:50.230 --> 18:53.199
 and she's...

18:53.233 --> 18:56.069
   - and l...
   - See?
   You don't even know her.

18:56.069 --> 18:59.072
 Jessie, your father
 will always love you,

18:59.072 --> 19:01.574
   no matter who he marries.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.911
  Go to the wedding.
  lf you don't you'll
  regret it forever.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.718
 You're right, Zack.
 l hate it when you're right.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.855
 Thanks.
 Can we still make it?

19:15.889 --> 19:18.692
   Hop in. Find out.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.160
 Oops.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.062
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.463
   Hold on.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.601
 Murray, when l make this putt,

19:28.635 --> 19:31.171
 you'll owe me $1,000!

19:32.572 --> 19:34.641
Fore!!

19:34.674 --> 19:37.577
   Not fair!
   Not fair!

19:45.919 --> 19:48.521
  Gee, will you look at that?

19:48.555 --> 19:51.524
  Mr. Spano's been at the altar
  all this time.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.108
  Now what do we do?

20:08.141 --> 20:10.810
 Nothing.
 It's too late. Look.

20:10.844 --> 20:13.780
  ( <i>Here Comes the Bride</i>
  playing )

20:21.087 --> 20:23.223
 - Zack: Hey! Hey!
 - ( Jessie screams )

20:33.099 --> 20:35.235
I'm sorry about Jessie.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.738
   So am l.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.640
  Zack:
  Here we go.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.811
   You can begin now,
   Reverend.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.146
Dearly beloved,

20:46.179 --> 20:49.049
 we are gathered here today
 to join David Spano

20:49.082 --> 20:52.085
  and Leslie Eisen
  in holy matrimony.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.023
   ( brakes squeal )

21:03.329 --> 21:05.331
   Wait, wait, wait!

21:15.075 --> 21:17.410
   You know me,
   I'm always late.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.246
   - I'm glad you made it.
   - Leslie: Me too.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.316
 Leslie, I'm sorry for all
 the awful
 things l said to you.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.218
   Apology accepted.

21:25.251 --> 21:28.088
  Now that you're
  marrying my father,
  you're stuck with me, too.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.990
  That's fine by me.
  l always wanted a daughter.

21:31.091 --> 21:34.661
- Even a brat like me?
- Even a brat like you.

21:37.197 --> 21:39.666
  ( guests applaud )

21:47.107 --> 21:49.342
 ( instrumental music plays )
