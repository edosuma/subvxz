WEBVTT

00:00.195 --> 00:01.595
Please welcome

00:01.620 --> 00:03.354
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

00:03.375 --> 00:05.642
and the guest of honor,
the American President,

00:05.667 --> 00:06.732
Donald Trump.

00:06.757 --> 00:10.559
Wow, the two royal
families together at last!

00:10.584 --> 00:12.551
We have so much in common...

00:12.576 --> 00:15.243
inherited wealth, sexual perversion.

00:15.268 --> 00:16.901
Let's get this out of the way...

00:16.926 --> 00:19.927
yes, I said Meghan Markle is "nasty".

00:19.929 --> 00:21.095
In my defense,

00:21.120 --> 00:23.954
every time I'm about to be
a guest in someone's house,

00:23.973 --> 00:26.307
I get into a public feud
with their granddaughter.

00:26.331 --> 00:27.763
This suit is tight.

00:27.788 --> 00:30.423
I'm gonna have to peck my way
out of it like a baby chick.

00:30.448 --> 00:32.113
Today, I am honored

00:32.139 --> 00:34.873
to sit next to the late,
great Barbara Bush.

00:34.882 --> 00:37.082
This is just like my semester abroad,

00:37.109 --> 00:40.009
only I haven't tried to
Amanda Knox my roommate.

00:40.010 --> 00:43.545
Happy 75th D-Day anniversary, everyone.

00:43.570 --> 00:47.338
To celebrate, we're grabbin'
our sunscreen and big umbrellas

00:47.363 --> 00:49.697
and headin' to Omaha Beach.

00:49.722 --> 00:51.188
Try to ignore Stephen Miller,

00:51.213 --> 00:53.603
who will be honoring the
fallen on the other side.

00:53.634 --> 00:55.267
Ohh, I'm so fucking hot.

00:55.292 --> 00:57.592
We won't be honoring John McCain,

00:57.617 --> 00:59.484
who refused to fight in World War II

00:59.509 --> 01:02.042
because of the lame excuse
that he was a toddler.

01:02.067 --> 01:04.301
Thank you to my advance
team for throwing tarps

01:04.325 --> 01:06.993
over all the gravestones
with the name "John"

01:07.018 --> 01:09.558
so I don't get grumpy
and have a bad beach day.

01:09.583 --> 01:12.683
They're gonna have to cut me out
of this suit over several hours

01:12.708 --> 01:13.975
so I don't get the bends.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.099
I'm so jet-lagged!

01:16.124 --> 01:19.225
I just wanna go back
to the hotel and sleep!

01:19.243 --> 01:21.510
I'll be back in time for the luau!

01:21.514 --> 01:24.080
For the last time... there's no luau!

01:24.105 --> 01:26.439
Ugh! This vacation sucks!

01:26.459 --> 01:29.793
So let's toast to our
nations' eternal friendship

01:29.818 --> 01:34.555
as we live out this scene from
a 1980s R-rated comedy called...

01:34.602 --> 01:36.834
I don't know... Boner-In-Chief.

01:36.859 --> 01:38.125
Uh-oh.

01:38.150 --> 01:40.851
That drink had a bubble. Hit the deck!

01:40.876 --> 01:44.043
- Oh.
- Oh! That is so much better.

01:44.077 --> 01:47.245
Uh-oh, here come the bends!

01:48.218 --> 01:51.119
Klobuchar!

01:53.526 --> 01:55.893
♪ Three white people on a couch ♪

01:55.918 --> 01:58.218
♪ It's Fox & Friends ♪

01:58.243 --> 01:59.810
The Midwest was starving

01:59.835 --> 02:01.312
- before I signed legislation...
- Right.

02:01.336 --> 02:02.480
... to make chickens
the size of mailboxes.

02:02.504 --> 02:03.704
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, right, right.

02:03.729 --> 02:05.180
And not the blue mailboxes either...

02:05.205 --> 02:06.972
- Okay.
- ... the weird locked mailboxes

02:06.997 --> 02:08.297
- next to the blue ones...
- Sure.

02:08.321 --> 02:09.733
... that the mailman hides his lunch

02:09.757 --> 02:11.601
- and nighttime clothes inside. Y...
- Okay.

02:11.626 --> 02:13.489
Good news... Mr. President Trump

02:13.514 --> 02:14.824
is about to break his record

02:14.849 --> 02:16.945
for longest uninterrupted call-in ever!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.952
They're installing suicide nets

02:18.977 --> 02:21.843
outside the closed-caption
office as we speak!

02:21.868 --> 02:23.322
And it's not just the Mexicans

02:23.346 --> 02:24.845
that are pouring over our borders...

02:24.870 --> 02:27.492
- Go off, girl!
- It's the Portuguese, too,

02:27.517 --> 02:30.039
but I don't see Jim
Acosta reporting on them.

02:30.064 --> 02:31.697
Jim Acosta is an old family friend,

02:31.722 --> 02:33.188
but now I hate his guts!

02:33.213 --> 02:35.747
I say we drop the big one on Portugal.

02:35.870 --> 02:37.837
What? What is he talking about?

02:37.862 --> 02:40.629
Let's nuke Jim Acosta,
too! If he's in Portugal,

02:40.654 --> 02:43.154
we can do a two-for-one
and save on shipping.

02:43.179 --> 02:46.049
So, if you want to grow
an extra arm this weekend,

02:46.074 --> 02:48.023
head downwind from Portugal!

02:52.088 --> 02:54.055
Does President Trump's nuclear threat

02:54.080 --> 02:56.028
mean he has gone full-on cuckoo bananas?

02:56.053 --> 02:58.486
A new poll shows 80% of
Americans describe him

02:58.511 --> 03:00.525
as "... unstable as a college freshman

03:00.550 --> 03:02.247
who drags his mattress off the bed frame

03:02.272 --> 03:03.305
and sleeps in the closet."

03:03.329 --> 03:05.931
Here to comment is Democratic
presidential candidate

03:05.956 --> 03:07.121
Senator Elizabeth Warren.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.913
Chuck, the President's erratic behavior

03:08.938 --> 03:10.638
poses a threat to the entire world,

03:10.663 --> 03:13.396
and that is not some
buttonedup senator talking

03:13.421 --> 03:16.222
it's laid-back,
beer-swillin' Lizzy Warren.

03:16.686 --> 03:18.185
Wow, that is warm.

03:18.210 --> 03:20.298
Or, could this be Trump's first move

03:20.323 --> 03:21.856
in a nine-dimensional chess game?

03:21.881 --> 03:24.464
- Absolutely not.
- Well, only time will tell.

03:24.489 --> 03:26.075
No, Chuck, he's dangerous.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.928
Only time will tell. Thank you, Senator.

03:29.112 --> 03:31.293
Geez, everyone's calling me a whack job

03:31.318 --> 03:33.434
just because I
threatened to nuke Norway.

03:33.631 --> 03:34.764
Portugal, sir.

03:34.789 --> 03:36.389
We know I'm not a details guy.

03:38.364 --> 03:40.831
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- The rapture is upon us!

03:40.856 --> 03:43.154
I can't wait to spend eternity in Heaven

03:43.179 --> 03:45.550
sorting buttons with Karen Pence!

03:45.575 --> 03:47.158
Relax, Rapture Randy.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.244
I just ordered a little
ballistic-missile test

03:49.269 --> 03:51.175
to make sure the seat
of Jim Acosta's pants

03:51.200 --> 03:52.333
stays coated in pee-pee.

03:52.358 --> 03:55.072
Whatever color pills you ate
today, eat a different color,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.446
or it's 25th Amendment time!

03:56.471 --> 03:58.426
Is that the one where you
have to say if you're a cop?

03:58.450 --> 04:00.609
It's the one where we
yank you out of office

04:00.634 --> 04:02.008
for acting like a loony toon.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.365
So someone grounded and
rational like Mike Pence

04:04.390 --> 04:06.468
- becomes president.
- I understand, God.

04:06.493 --> 04:09.060
I still have more
buttons to sort on Earth.

04:10.932 --> 04:12.631
Cheerio.

04:12.656 --> 04:14.897
Leaders around the globe
held an emergency summit

04:14.922 --> 04:17.844
to discuss President Trump's
threat to annihilate Portugal.

04:17.869 --> 04:20.411
We've obtained audio from
the closed-door meeting...

04:20.437 --> 04:22.424
The European Union will act decisively

04:22.449 --> 04:24.054
to neutralize this tyrant!

04:24.079 --> 04:26.210
We take the whole
"ranting mad-man" thing

04:26.235 --> 04:28.768
pretty seriously here
in Germany, you know.

04:28.793 --> 04:30.733
Oh, come on, he misspoke!

04:30.758 --> 04:32.768
Isn't Trump allowed one mistake?

04:32.793 --> 04:36.071
No matter who I threaten,
Dr. Ronny, I just can't win!

04:36.096 --> 04:39.083
They've got it wrong...
I'm a very stable genius!

04:39.108 --> 04:41.908
According to my Brain-O-Meter,
class-action lawsuit pending,

04:41.933 --> 04:43.508
your brain waves are pulsating

04:43.533 --> 04:46.296
at 720 kilowhirls per miliyear.

04:46.321 --> 04:47.630
And that's good, right?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.748
Oh, off the charts, kilowhirl-wise.

04:49.773 --> 04:51.451
I knew it! Just give me a doctor's note

04:51.476 --> 04:53.328
saying I'm not a danger
to myself or others,

04:53.353 --> 04:55.305
or I'll do something
real bad to both of us.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.750
So why did you threaten Portugal, sir?

04:57.775 --> 05:01.310
I was just doing some
thermonuclear free association

05:01.335 --> 05:03.255
with my Fox & Friends, and it stuck.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.847
Now I have to do it or no
one will take me seriously,

05:05.872 --> 05:07.327
and if no one takes me seriously,

05:07.352 --> 05:09.227
I'll have to blow up the whole world.

05:09.252 --> 05:12.342
Sounds reasonable to me, and
I live in the back of a car.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.113
Bill Shine! Aren't you supposed to be

05:16.138 --> 05:18.386
getting the President
re-elected in perpetuity?

05:18.411 --> 05:20.287
I took a long lunch
because this is important...

05:20.311 --> 05:22.746
when I worked at Fox News,
I championed you guys.

05:22.771 --> 05:25.790
- Hell, I made you who you are.
- We're your Frankenstein!

05:25.815 --> 05:28.136
Uh, Frankenstein was the scientist.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.772
- Godzilla was the monster.
- Shut up, Kilmeade.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.539
Now my loyalty is to the White House,

05:32.564 --> 05:35.289
so I need you three to stop
driving the President crazy.

05:35.314 --> 05:38.423
Oh, stop... he's no crazier
than our loyal viewers.

05:38.448 --> 05:41.159
They adore us so much, they
send 40-page love letters

05:41.184 --> 05:42.578
written in their own fluids.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.940
- Awww!
- Awww!

05:43.965 --> 05:45.620
Just make the show a little more gentle

05:45.645 --> 05:48.166
until the President stops
trying to kill all of us

05:48.191 --> 05:50.191
and goes back to trying
to kill some of us.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.624
Daddy, we're here because we care deeply

05:53.649 --> 05:55.550
about not getting irradiated.

05:55.575 --> 05:58.370
Thanks for your concern, but
I got this note from Dr. Ronny

05:58.395 --> 06:01.295
saying my brain cholesterol
is at an all-time good,

06:01.320 --> 06:03.397
so I'm perfectly capable
of running the planet.

06:03.422 --> 06:04.828
Anyway, we asked someone

06:04.853 --> 06:06.737
who actually cares
about you to join us...

06:06.762 --> 06:08.451
- Hey, Donald!
- Putin?

06:08.476 --> 06:09.609
Yeah, buddy, look,

06:09.634 --> 06:12.067
I'm all for unprovoked military force,

06:12.092 --> 06:15.280
but if it's on the same day
you appoint a Terry Fator puppet

06:15.305 --> 06:17.945
to the United Nations, it
makes people a little jumpy.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.504
Terry Fator's puppets
are notorious instigators.

06:20.529 --> 06:22.837
Not exactly the right
temperament for the U.N.

06:22.862 --> 06:24.626
There you go, sort of.

06:26.329 --> 06:28.663
Bill Shine wants gentle and cerebral?

06:28.688 --> 06:31.453
This is Fox & Friends... not PBS.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.350
Nobody watches us to chill out...

06:33.375 --> 06:35.645
they watch us to hear how Ocasio-Cortez

06:35.670 --> 06:37.758
is personally stealing
land from white Africans!

06:37.783 --> 06:39.961
There is something to be said

06:39.986 --> 06:42.458
for the slow, methodical world-building

06:42.483 --> 06:44.762
of a PBS costume drama.

06:44.787 --> 06:46.257
Slow... methodical...

06:46.282 --> 06:47.725
what the hell are you
talking about, Brian?

06:47.749 --> 06:49.452
I wrote some scripts.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.462
Never mind. They're stupid.
You don't want to see them.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.680
- Of course we don't!
- Fine, here they are.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.180
I don't know about this...

06:55.205 --> 06:57.917
Whoa, I get to wear a
big, tall hat? I'm in!

06:57.942 --> 06:59.636
Me too! Mostly because,

06:59.661 --> 07:02.229
if I disagree with you guys,
you'll ignore me anyway!

07:04.943 --> 07:09.045
Daddy! You said you'd stop
these missile tests! God!

07:09.070 --> 07:10.513
They scare the shit

07:10.538 --> 07:12.858
out of people who are
less brave than me!

07:12.883 --> 07:15.651
Listen, I made a promise to
someone... I forgot who...

07:15.676 --> 07:17.809
that I'd blow up Portugal...
I'm not sure why...

07:17.834 --> 07:19.419
and I'm not about to embarrass myself

07:19.444 --> 07:21.778
in front of whoever for
whatever reason that was.

07:21.803 --> 07:25.204
Daddy... where's Eric? You were
supposed to give him a bath!

07:26.487 --> 07:28.979
You said to wait for you, s-so I did.

07:29.004 --> 07:32.082
His nuts are so small and wrinkly, Dad!

07:32.107 --> 07:34.040
They'll never be normal nuts again!

07:34.065 --> 07:35.965
Relax... Anyone could have forgotten

07:35.990 --> 07:37.920
their screaming adult son in the bath.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.713
Daddy... what if it had
been someone you care about?

07:40.738 --> 07:42.571
Someone... like me?

07:42.596 --> 07:46.487
Oh, my God. My children.
My one good children.

07:46.512 --> 07:49.964
Please, Daddy, let us help
you make your brain good again.

07:49.989 --> 07:51.042
For the country,

07:51.067 --> 07:53.631
so it'll trust you enough
to steal all its money.

07:53.656 --> 07:56.356
And for Eric, whose nuts art in Heaven.

07:56.381 --> 07:59.172
Let's do it. Not just for Eric's nuts,

07:59.197 --> 08:01.146
but the whole country's nuts.

08:01.171 --> 08:02.303
- Cool!
- Yay!

08:04.099 --> 08:07.067
Come back if you
need c-cold, dirty water!

08:10.341 --> 08:12.908
Kids, we all know that
the best way to prove

08:12.933 --> 08:15.333
someone is competent,
sane, and trustworthy is...

08:15.358 --> 08:17.205
Prime-time televised game show!

08:17.230 --> 08:19.464
Exactly! In one week's time,

08:19.489 --> 08:22.762
I'm gonna show the country,
live, on network TV,

08:22.787 --> 08:25.529
that my brain is more
functional than Ronald Reagan's

08:25.554 --> 08:27.231
the day he left office.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.156
I'm thinking my doctor
who lives in a car

08:29.181 --> 08:31.538
tests me in front of a billion
Americans, and we call it...

08:31.563 --> 08:32.648
Big Brain Showdown!

08:32.673 --> 08:35.173
With a special
performance by Jamiroquai.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.335
Love it. At the end,

08:36.360 --> 08:38.660
Dr. Ronny will smash my
brain with a sledgehammer

08:38.686 --> 08:41.111
and, if it puffs back up
with a big boing sound,

08:41.135 --> 08:42.857
everyone will know I'm fine.

08:42.881 --> 08:45.215
I'll check to make sure
Jamiroquai isn't touring.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.907
Ivanka, I really hope he's not touring.

Three white people in a house...

08:59.518 --> 09:01.552
It's Friendship Manor.

09:02.430 --> 09:04.871
Lady Ainsleyhardt, have
you readied the dining room

09:04.896 --> 09:07.137
for this evening's repaste? R-Re-past?

09:07.162 --> 09:09.199
Yes, I have left ample space

09:09.224 --> 09:13.059
between the Duke of Winshire
and the Marquess of Aberdingle.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.957
And have you considered
my proposal of marriage?

09:15.982 --> 09:19.372
It would secure Friendship
Manor for generations to come.

09:19.397 --> 09:20.764
I have, Lord Doocifus.

09:20.789 --> 09:23.056
It's just that my heart
belongs to another...

09:27.476 --> 09:30.344
This is extremely my shit.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.561
We need to make sure you actually win

09:33.586 --> 09:34.952
Big Brain Showdown,

09:34.977 --> 09:38.346
so let's exercise that
noggin with a brain teaser.

09:38.371 --> 09:40.404
After my divorce, I found solace

09:40.429 --> 09:43.229
in the ancient practice of mindfulness.

09:43.254 --> 09:46.153
Okay, a murderer is
condemned to death...

09:46.178 --> 09:48.064
Biased judge, activist court,

09:48.089 --> 09:49.912
appeal it till it gets
to Kavanaugh's desk.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.538
- Solved it.
- Daddy! Hold on! I wasn't done!

09:52.563 --> 09:56.386
Now just close your eyes and
let your thoughts drift away.

09:56.411 --> 09:58.243
Whooooosh.

09:58.345 --> 10:00.379
Whoo...

10:00.404 --> 10:02.571
Oh, shit! I swallowed a bug!

10:02.596 --> 10:04.930
Now a bug's gonna grow in my stomach.

10:04.955 --> 10:07.156
Get it out before it
goes through puberty!

10:07.181 --> 10:11.567
As punishment, the murderer has
to enter one of three rooms...

10:11.592 --> 10:14.926
one with assassins, one that's on fire,

10:14.951 --> 10:18.220
and one with lions who
haven't eaten in years.

10:18.245 --> 10:19.942
Wait, are the lions tigers?

10:19.967 --> 10:22.434
Of course! Actually, wait. Are they?

10:22.459 --> 10:24.937
Sir, the United Nations Security Council

10:24.962 --> 10:26.371
has been on hold for three days.

10:26.396 --> 10:27.495
What should I tell them?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.053
We're doing something!

10:29.078 --> 10:32.068
So I just pull on that thing
in the back of your throat

10:32.093 --> 10:33.867
- until you barf the bug?
- Uh-huh.

10:33.892 --> 10:35.958
Back at Wharton, my
buddy Brench taught me

10:35.983 --> 10:37.049
that's the "vom-cord".

10:37.074 --> 10:39.675
Hello, zoo? Are lions tigers?

10:39.700 --> 10:42.473
Ask him if lions are
tigers. I am. Shut up!

10:42.498 --> 10:43.564
Uh-huh...

10:43.589 --> 10:45.089
Oh...

10:45.114 --> 10:46.751
But how do you know?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.476
- They don't know.
- I knew it!

10:48.501 --> 10:50.502
Ask them if donkeys are horses.

10:50.527 --> 10:52.158
Shut up, Pompeo!

10:52.183 --> 10:54.350
Actually, that's a good question.

10:56.938 --> 10:59.826
- Do you feel anything?
- Almost!

10:59.851 --> 11:01.351
All right, I'm gonna...

11:01.376 --> 11:03.009
I'm grab... I got something. Hold it.

11:04.421 --> 11:06.477
Everything okay over there?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.535
Yeah, just doing some mediation.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.202
I love you too, Kilmington.

11:12.227 --> 11:15.370
Even if you are a penniless
footman with rotten teeth.

11:15.395 --> 11:17.866
Then there is something
I must show you...

11:19.334 --> 11:22.838
The will of my uncle, Count Friendship!

11:22.863 --> 11:25.099
Wasn't that destroyed
in the orphanage fire?

11:25.124 --> 11:26.130
Shh!

11:26.155 --> 11:28.887
But that was destroyed
in the orphanage fire!

11:28.912 --> 11:30.837
- What'd I say? Knew it.
- Shut the fuck up!

11:30.862 --> 11:34.815
I found it in Doocifus's
chambers, and there's more...

11:34.840 --> 11:37.195
Doocifus is not your cousin.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.396
He is...

11:38.421 --> 11:42.667
Mister Doonces of 49
Poorman's Lane, Coventry.

11:42.692 --> 11:44.425
So you've found me out, have you?

11:44.450 --> 11:46.699
But if he's not really
my cousin, then...

11:46.724 --> 11:48.845
Then you, Lady Ainsleyhardt,

11:48.870 --> 11:52.605
are the true heir to Friendship Manor...

11:52.630 --> 11:54.635
- Whoooooaaaa.
- Whoooooaaaa.

11:55.884 --> 11:58.182
I think Dad's swamp
brain might be cured.

11:58.207 --> 11:59.557
He helped me barf up a bug.

11:59.582 --> 12:02.087
And he helped me get
that dumb zoo guy fired.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.291
He's gonna be so psyched
that he didn't have to visit

12:04.316 --> 12:05.323
an actual mental-health professional.

12:05.347 --> 12:06.365
Now answer me this...

12:06.389 --> 12:09.157
what has Europe ever done for us?!

12:09.182 --> 12:12.369
Drag them, Hannity!

12:12.394 --> 12:15.161
As far as I'm concerned,
Christopher Columbus

12:15.186 --> 12:18.135
wasn't even born till he got to America!

12:18.160 --> 12:19.793
Tell Spain to lean the other way

12:19.818 --> 12:22.324
because it's Portugal nuke time, baby!

12:22.349 --> 12:25.010
This is the problem, Dad.
TV makes you nuttier

12:25.035 --> 12:28.336
than the 23-year-old high-school
kid in my two-man fight club.

12:28.361 --> 12:29.994
Sorry, Daddy, but the TVs

12:30.019 --> 12:32.217
are going straight into "insinkerator".

12:32.242 --> 12:33.251
Fine, take it.

12:33.276 --> 12:35.332
Whatever Fox & Friends
is doing these days

12:35.357 --> 12:38.372
- is extremely not my shit.
- Get some rest.

12:38.397 --> 12:40.713
Tomorrow, you have to
prove to the American people

12:40.738 --> 12:44.528
that you're as with it as a
72-year-old speed-freak can be.

12:44.553 --> 12:45.753
Hello?

12:45.777 --> 12:48.010
I think I'm clean now!

12:50.127 --> 12:53.403
"I love Lady Ainsleyhardt's
indomibibble spirit."

12:53.428 --> 12:56.363
It's just nice getting fan mail
that doesn't refer to my womb

12:56.388 --> 12:58.429
as an essential weapon in the race war.

12:58.454 --> 13:00.979
"Doocifus is bae"? I don't
know what that means,

13:01.004 --> 13:03.426
but it ends in "e", so it's okay by me.

13:03.451 --> 13:05.561
Brian, how do you write
these genius scripts?

13:05.586 --> 13:07.670
I installed some beams in my house

13:07.695 --> 13:09.725
and got the feet and inches mixed up,

13:09.750 --> 13:11.671
so every night I run full steam

13:11.696 --> 13:14.997
into a piece of gorgeous,
varnished cherry-wood.

13:15.022 --> 13:17.422
And when I come to, there's a "scrimpt".

13:17.447 --> 13:20.113
Wow, this one's signed
"Barack and Michelle".

13:20.138 --> 13:23.122
And this one is from
the Peabody Foundation!

13:23.147 --> 13:25.757
Guys, you got to feel
how thick this paper is.

13:25.782 --> 13:27.593
Ooh!

13:27.618 --> 13:30.321
I think it might be five
slices stuck together.

13:31.313 --> 13:33.265
Ohh, it's not!

13:34.881 --> 13:38.237
Daddy, it's almost time for
your Big Brain Showdown.

13:38.262 --> 13:40.038
Remember... it's called underwear

13:40.063 --> 13:42.764
because you "wear" it when
you're "under" the sky!

13:42.789 --> 13:45.777
Let's go show this country
how coherent I can be

13:45.802 --> 13:48.173
for a short amount
of time on television.

13:49.048 --> 13:51.349
Welcome to The Big Brain Showdown.

13:51.374 --> 13:53.851
The only show where we
test how healthy, buff,

13:53.876 --> 13:56.387
and whisper-quiet the
President's brain is.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.340
I'm your host, Dr. Ronny.

13:58.365 --> 13:59.957
Let's meet our contestant.

13:59.982 --> 14:01.549
Born in Queens,

14:01.574 --> 14:05.182
Donald John Trump's colon has the
same microbial biodiversity

14:05.207 --> 14:07.031
as an escalator handrail.

14:07.056 --> 14:10.224
Tonight, he's playing for the
trust of the American people

14:10.249 --> 14:11.936
and his favorite charity,

14:11.961 --> 14:14.222
Eric's Home for Hypothermic Men.

14:14.446 --> 14:17.085
The showdown consists of 25 questions

14:17.110 --> 14:19.757
that test the memory,
logic, and reasoning skills

14:19.782 --> 14:20.782
of the President.

14:20.807 --> 14:24.375
Seven or more correct answers
will be considered an A++.

14:24.454 --> 14:25.454
Let's begin.

14:26.942 --> 14:28.742
Marcus Aurelius once said,

14:28.767 --> 14:31.835
"The soul becomes dyed with
the color of its thoughts."

14:31.860 --> 14:32.926
Name a color.

14:32.951 --> 14:34.250
Strawberry.

14:34.595 --> 14:35.995
Correct.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.400
What song is this?

14:37.425 --> 14:41.242
"Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way."

14:41.267 --> 14:42.432
Jingy Bells.

14:42.457 --> 14:43.945
Judges.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.837
We'll accept Jingy Bells.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.586
- John Elway.
- Correct.

14:47.611 --> 14:50.285
Blair, Jo, Natalie,
Tootie, and Mrs. Garrett.

14:50.310 --> 14:51.341
Correct.

14:51.366 --> 14:53.286
And Godzilla was the monster.

14:53.311 --> 14:55.251
- Correct.
- He was brought back to life

14:55.276 --> 14:57.547
- when Trinity confessed her love.
- Correct.

14:57.572 --> 14:58.726
- Nine.
- Correct.

14:58.751 --> 15:00.954
- No, wait. 42,000.
- Correct.

15:00.979 --> 15:03.467
They were being held in the
basement of Comet Ping Pong!

15:03.492 --> 15:04.492
Correct.

15:04.517 --> 15:07.833
Marry Kissinger, Fuck
McNamara, Kill Nixon.

15:07.858 --> 15:08.858
Judges?

15:08.883 --> 15:09.884
Correct.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.923
And now your final question...

15:11.948 --> 15:14.998
Who's a big, loud boy
with a big, healthy brain?

15:15.023 --> 15:17.226
Uh... me?

15:17.251 --> 15:19.059
Well, let's just say...

15:19.083 --> 15:21.648
... we will reveal the
results after this break.

15:21.673 --> 15:24.507
They always do this.

15:24.532 --> 15:28.187
Hi, I'm Mike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow,

15:28.212 --> 15:31.113
the most comfortable
pillow you'll ever own.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.315
Have you ever thought that

15:32.340 --> 15:34.436
something that was perfectly fine

15:34.461 --> 15:36.294
should be different somehow?

15:36.319 --> 15:38.020
Then buy my pillow.

15:38.045 --> 15:42.036
I could never get a restful
sleep because of my pillow,

15:42.061 --> 15:43.125
so one night,

15:43.150 --> 15:46.252
I chucked a brick through a
high-school home-ec window,

15:46.277 --> 15:48.564
ripped the sewing machine off the bolts,

15:48.589 --> 15:51.400
and stitched together
the American dream.

15:51.425 --> 15:54.593
Call now, or maybe I'll call you!

15:54.618 --> 15:55.971
Welcome back.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.863
I know a lot of hypothermic men

15:57.888 --> 15:59.626
who will be very happy tonight.

15:59.651 --> 16:02.154
Mr. President, you
are mentally competent.

16:03.270 --> 16:05.036
- Yay, Daddy!
- Yay! Ugh!

16:05.061 --> 16:06.707
I swallowed some confetti.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.398
Ivanka! Pull my vom-cord!

16:09.915 --> 16:12.597
Was last night's Big Brain
Showdown a success?

16:12.622 --> 16:14.656
The EU released a
statement saying, quote,

16:14.681 --> 16:16.887
"We take comfort that his
family is occupying him

16:16.912 --> 16:18.445
with a make-believe game show."

16:19.820 --> 16:22.020
And now, accepting the Peabody Award

16:22.045 --> 16:23.411
for excellence in entertainment,

16:23.436 --> 16:26.034
is the cast of my favorite
show, Friendship Manor.

16:26.059 --> 16:28.068
Whoa! Happy days!

16:28.093 --> 16:31.293
Lord Doocifus himself. This is so cool.

16:31.741 --> 16:35.042
To anyone who ever heard
the words "you can't",

16:35.067 --> 16:36.500
"no one wants that",

16:36.602 --> 16:39.527
or "don't eat that...
they made it in props",

16:39.552 --> 16:42.409
I am living proof
that you can do it all.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.786
Okay, I'll go.

16:43.810 --> 16:46.761
Keep dreaming! Keep
friendshipping! Keep mattering!

16:46.786 --> 16:49.500
Kaitlyn, Kirstyn, and
Bryan Jr., go to bed!

16:49.525 --> 16:51.025
Daddy won a Peabody!

16:54.987 --> 16:58.499
Nice job tonight, Dad. You
beat the shit out of your brain!

16:58.524 --> 17:00.950
That one question about
whether cars go zoom

17:00.975 --> 17:03.434
- was pretty tough.
- Well, see you later, Daddy.

17:03.459 --> 17:05.005
You know we all have, like, five kids?

17:05.030 --> 17:06.128
And they call me Mom.

17:06.154 --> 17:07.882
I don't have time to get
into it, but it's insane.

17:07.906 --> 17:09.204
Okay, bye!

17:09.586 --> 17:13.012
Ahh, got the night all to myself.

17:13.038 --> 17:15.806
Now, where did I put my
mind-enhancing puzzles?

17:19.006 --> 17:21.040
I've looked everywhere. Hm.

17:21.065 --> 17:24.119
Well, it would be fun to
treat myself to a little TV.

17:25.236 --> 17:27.663
Oh, yeah. TV gone, too.

17:31.093 --> 17:34.912
Can we swing by Men's Warehouse
so I can return this suit?

17:34.937 --> 17:37.458
Hey, hey! Fellas!

17:37.483 --> 17:40.645
Did you also get turned away
from the Peabody afterparty

17:40.670 --> 17:42.575
because you forgot
how to spell your name?

17:42.600 --> 17:45.082
- Shut up!
- Brian, Brian, Brian...

17:45.107 --> 17:47.660
Okay, while you were at these,
uh, Golden Snowflake Awards,

17:47.685 --> 17:48.691
we were in the studio,

17:48.716 --> 17:50.773
ensuring the First Amendment
rights of white people

17:50.798 --> 17:53.474
to sing the N-word at karaoke,
and you weren't there.

17:53.499 --> 17:57.388
But Bill Shine told me to stop
driving the President insane,

17:57.413 --> 17:58.498
- so I just thought I...
- Oh, oh, oh.

17:58.522 --> 18:00.350
That's what you think, Brian?
You thought wrong.

18:00.374 --> 18:02.171
Your allegiance is
to Fox News... got it?

18:02.196 --> 18:03.329
We all took the same vows

18:03.354 --> 18:05.065
in Roger Ailes's amphibious sex plane.

18:05.090 --> 18:08.251
But Friendship Manor
is life-affirming TV.

18:08.276 --> 18:10.894
Fox News doesn't affirm life...
it De-firms life,

18:10.919 --> 18:13.305
and scares men into thinking
their sperm count will drop

18:13.330 --> 18:14.530
if they let their wives drive.

18:14.554 --> 18:16.153
Don't forget that, Kilmeade.

18:16.927 --> 18:18.927
Hey, can we stop at Men's Warehouse?

18:18.952 --> 18:20.880
I want to dig through
the discount suit bin.

18:22.139 --> 18:24.406
Huh. No TV in here either...

18:24.773 --> 18:27.641
I'll just sit here alone
with my thoughts.

18:30.591 --> 18:32.424
Oh, hi. Good to see you.

18:32.449 --> 18:34.159
I'm gonna need the nuclear football

18:34.184 --> 18:36.218
and an upside-down
umbrella full of Diet Coke.

18:36.897 --> 18:39.131
Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Love the tie.

18:45.537 --> 18:47.237
Brian, I had a question

18:47.262 --> 18:49.174
about the Baronet's harpsichord teacher.

18:49.199 --> 18:51.453
It's over, guys. Friendship
Manor is done.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.974
But Doocifus still has his maidenhead!

18:53.999 --> 18:57.020
Tucker and Sean were right.
We should be out there

18:57.045 --> 19:00.245
scaring old ladies into
buying barbed-wire doormats...

19:00.270 --> 19:02.026
not acting out fiction.

19:02.051 --> 19:05.088
But we've got so many
stories left to tell!

19:05.113 --> 19:07.816
What about their stories, Ainsley?

19:07.918 --> 19:09.395
But Ainsleyhardt

19:09.419 --> 19:11.573
is a three-dimension female character!

19:11.598 --> 19:14.316
And who's gonna tell my big, tall hat?

19:15.335 --> 19:17.903
We now present a very special

19:17.928 --> 19:21.171
Friendship Manor.

19:21.196 --> 19:24.098
Hello, viewers. It's me, Brian Kilmeade.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.443
I mean Kilmington,

19:25.468 --> 19:27.734
or, as you would have
learned in the next episode,

19:27.759 --> 19:30.504
Kilmington's brother, who
was feared lost at sea.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.340
- Are you kidding me?!
- Don't spoil it!

19:32.365 --> 19:35.614
Friendship Manor is
going on permanent hiatus

19:35.639 --> 19:38.352
because I don't know how
to stand up for myself.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.011
Fare-thee-well.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.026
I'm lost. Did we miss an episode?

19:43.051 --> 19:45.205
I bet it all pays off.
Just keep watching.

19:46.355 --> 19:48.732
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Daddy! Daddy! Open up!

19:48.757 --> 19:51.998
What's he doing in there? We
took away his TV and phone.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.476
Hey, what's that thing that
Dad says every day at breakfast

19:54.501 --> 19:56.717
about leaving him
alone with his thoughts?

19:56.742 --> 19:59.186
Oh, uh, don't ever leave
me alone with my thoughts,

19:59.211 --> 20:00.922
or I'll blow up the entire world.

20:00.947 --> 20:02.512
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

20:02.537 --> 20:05.772
Hey! Hey! Do not
leave me alone with my thoughts!

20:05.797 --> 20:07.905
I will kill everything forever!

20:08.138 --> 20:09.871
You know what this means?

20:09.896 --> 20:12.832
He's having breakfast without us.

20:12.857 --> 20:14.457
Daddy, no!

20:14.482 --> 20:16.856
We're hungry, too!

20:16.881 --> 20:18.949
So I walk into the 21 Club,

20:18.973 --> 20:22.143
and I see Andre Agassi,
and he has his back to me.

20:22.168 --> 20:24.634
And he knew I was gonna
walk in. He knew it.

20:24.659 --> 20:26.768
So he'll be dead, too.

20:27.151 --> 20:29.994
I'm Wolf Blitzer and
you're watching me realize

20:30.019 --> 20:31.744
I left my lunch in my car.

20:31.769 --> 20:33.418
It's shrimp salad... it'll keep.

20:33.443 --> 20:34.881
With the President isolated

20:34.906 --> 20:37.638
and in possession of
the nuclear football,

20:37.663 --> 20:39.599
European leaders are considering

20:39.624 --> 20:41.559
a preemptive strike on the U.S.

20:41.584 --> 20:43.685
Uh-oh, that's where the shrimp salad is.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.364
Meanwhile, Vice President Pence
and the cabinet are deciding

20:47.389 --> 20:49.715
whether or not to remove
Trump from office.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.973
Breakups are tough.

20:50.998 --> 20:53.434
Launch codes are around here somewhere.

20:55.727 --> 20:58.368
Ugh, why's everything so hard to find?

20:59.141 --> 21:01.329
Yikes, that guy looks like crap.

21:01.354 --> 21:02.624
No, you look like crap.

21:02.649 --> 21:04.293
No, you look like crap.

21:04.318 --> 21:05.863
No, you look like crap.

21:05.888 --> 21:07.691
You can't talk to me like that!

21:07.716 --> 21:10.997
But I'm part of you, idiot.
I'm your subconscious.

21:11.022 --> 21:12.121
Subconscious...

21:12.146 --> 21:14.211
Is that the room where
rodeo clowns hang out

21:14.236 --> 21:15.448
before it's time to go in?

21:15.473 --> 21:16.773
God, you're dumb.

21:16.798 --> 21:18.783
It's the place deep inside your head

21:18.808 --> 21:20.273
where all your emotions live.

21:20.298 --> 21:21.974
And it is rough down here.

21:21.999 --> 21:24.662
Oh, no! I'm crazy, aren't I?

21:24.687 --> 21:27.064
Is that why I'm such a math genius?

21:27.089 --> 21:29.923
You're more of a run-of-the-mill
sociopathic narcissist,

21:29.948 --> 21:32.836
who, through a weird twist of
fate, can destroy the world.

21:32.861 --> 21:34.533
Okay. What's the bad news?

21:34.558 --> 21:37.173
You'll destroy us with it,
you dumb piece of shit.

21:37.198 --> 21:38.775
There's always a catch.

21:40.334 --> 21:42.511
Hey, it's Doocifus and Ainsleyhardt!

21:42.536 --> 21:44.480
We don't do that show anymore!

21:44.505 --> 21:45.756
No selfies!

21:45.781 --> 21:48.585
There they are! The people
we've been looking for.

21:48.610 --> 21:50.042
So, like, how are you guys?

21:50.067 --> 21:52.299
Dad is about to blow up the free world,

21:52.324 --> 21:53.848
but, seriously, how are you guys?

21:53.873 --> 21:56.543
Here's some coins, kids. Go play
Buck Hunter or something.

21:56.568 --> 21:59.085
He gave them to me.
That means I'm in charge.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.463
I'm gonna be good!

22:00.488 --> 22:02.419
The President needs the
old Fox & Friends show

22:02.444 --> 22:05.169
to get the steam out of his ears
so it doesn't cook his brain.

22:05.194 --> 22:07.227
The old show? But I can't even remember

22:07.252 --> 22:09.765
why wealthy old white men
are underprivileged anymore.

22:09.790 --> 22:13.621
Maybe this will jog your memory.
"Dear Fox & Friends.

22:13.646 --> 22:15.755
If I didn't have you to talk to,

22:15.780 --> 22:18.114
I would probably kill everybody.

22:18.139 --> 22:20.539
I love you so much.

22:20.564 --> 22:23.919
Yours, the President
of the United States."

22:23.944 --> 22:27.022
I was packing up Kilmington's
cummerbund when I found this.

22:27.047 --> 22:30.426
And there are 30 more, just
like it, all from the President.

22:30.451 --> 22:32.037
He needs us, damn it.

22:32.062 --> 22:35.075
What do you say, Fox &
Friends star Ainsley Earhardt?

22:35.100 --> 22:36.999
I actually prefer Friendship Manor.

22:37.024 --> 22:39.053
She's in... let's go!

22:39.393 --> 22:42.528
All those in favor of removing
the President from office

22:42.553 --> 22:44.499
and installing me instead?

22:44.524 --> 22:46.730
Wait! I'm not crazy!

22:46.755 --> 22:48.989
The mirror-me said so!

22:49.169 --> 22:50.214
Yikes.

22:50.239 --> 22:52.373
You guys believe me, right?

22:53.784 --> 22:56.518
Wow, nobody's on my side.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.996
And after all the stuff I've done

22:59.021 --> 23:00.921
for your investment portfolios.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.880
Fine, say goodbye to Earth!

23:07.857 --> 23:11.166
♪ It's Fox & Friends ♪

23:11.191 --> 23:12.523
Whoa! It's TV!

23:12.548 --> 23:14.248
Fox & Friends... activate!

23:14.273 --> 23:16.538
God, I hate that nuclear football,

23:16.563 --> 23:17.696
don't you, Brian?

23:17.721 --> 23:20.474
It makes me sick, yee-uck!

23:20.499 --> 23:22.232
Get rid of it!

23:22.257 --> 23:24.755
Yeah... yeah... I hate it, too.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.380
You know what else makes me sick?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.914
What, Mr. President?

23:27.939 --> 23:30.855
Integration. The trickle-down
part of economics.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.519
Swiss Family Robinson.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.465
So, we're just gonna
pretend this is fine?

23:34.490 --> 23:35.955
Consider the alternative.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.859
God, guide my hand as I use this device

23:38.884 --> 23:41.639
to wipe the cast of
The L Word from Earth.

23:41.664 --> 23:44.464
Trump's cabinet has voted
to reinstall the President.

23:44.489 --> 23:47.103
Meanwhile, psychologists
unanimously agree

23:47.128 --> 23:49.558
that Trump is a ticking time
bomb of unchecked emotion.

23:49.583 --> 23:50.649
But is he?

23:50.674 --> 23:53.075
Or did his bishop just
checkmate the media's queen?

23:53.100 --> 23:54.942
I'm Chuck Todd, I
pretend to enjoy football

23:54.967 --> 23:58.203
because I'm scared of my dad,
and this is Meet the Press.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.011
The Arctic shelf is such a drama queen.

24:01.036 --> 24:03.648
I mean, if you're gonna
melt, just melt already.

24:03.673 --> 24:04.720
I know that's right.

24:04.745 --> 24:05.907
That's my president.

24:05.932 --> 24:07.189
Shelf bad.

24:07.214 --> 24:08.911
I say we torch the whole thing.

24:08.936 --> 24:10.857
Mr. President, can we take five?

24:10.882 --> 24:13.515
I wouldn't mind popping into
the bathroom real quick.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.561
Sure. In the meantime,
maybe I'll turn off

24:15.586 --> 24:18.487
all the power grids and see
which city screams the loudest.

24:18.512 --> 24:20.600
On second thought, we can hold it.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.227
Luckily for me, I can use
my big hat as a toilet!

24:24.252 --> 24:25.585
Why are we still watching this?

24:25.610 --> 24:29.176
Uh, Michelle, I told you,
it's going to pay off.

25:27.489 --> 25:28.889
Trump!
