WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:06.438
-Riley: <i> I APOLOGIZED!</i>
-Maya: <i> I DON'T CARE!</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:08.474
I APOLOGIZED LIKE 50 TIMES.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.209
YOU DON'T DO THAT TO ME.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.477
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
ME SAY I'M SORRY?

00:11.479 --> 00:12.511
ARE YOU ACTUALLY SORRY?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.912
NO!

00:13.914 --> 00:15.280
OH, THIS ONE'S BAD.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.915
IT'S RILEY AND MAYA.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.484
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.387
FINE, YOU DON'T
WANT TO SIT BY ME?
FABULOUS.

00:21.389 --> 00:25.257
I WILL NOT STINK UP
THE INTEGRITY OF
OUR BAY WINDOW

00:25.259 --> 00:27.259
WITH THIS RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.395
YOU COME HERE
AND STINK IT UP
RIGHT NOW.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.232
NO, THIS ONE'S REALLY BAD.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.933
IT'LL GO AWAY.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.535
THEY'RE GONNA
MARRY EACH OTHER.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.305
Maya:
<i>YOU STOOD UP</i>
<i>FOR LUCAS AND NOT ME!</i>

00:40.307 --> 00:41.540
I'M NOT STANDING UP FOR HIM.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.975
YOU DIDN'T DISAGREE WITH HIM.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.377
WELL, WHEN YOU REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT, HE WASN'T WRONG.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.812
WHO CARES?

00:46.813 --> 00:48.246
OH, RIGHT AND WRONG
DON'T MATTER NOW?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.982
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IS YOU AND ME.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.350
WHEN HAVE I EVER
NOT STOOD UP FOR YOU?

00:51.352 --> 00:52.351
WHEN I'M WRONG!

00:52.353 --> 00:53.385
YOU'RE ALWAYS WRONG!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.837
(gasps)

00:54.838 --> 00:56.288
OR YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT.
WHO CARES?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.357
I DON'T LISTEN, I JUST
STICK UP FOR YOU
AUTOMATICALLY.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.359
OOH, CHICK FIGHT!

01:01.562 --> 01:04.296
CHICK FIGHT RIGHT HERE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.366
ONE DOLLAR TO SEE
THE SHOCKER BY THE LOCKERS.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.336
BROUGHT TO YOU BY
ZAY BABINEAUX ENTERPRISES.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.505
I'M NOT GONNA BE
THE CAUSE OF THIS.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.506
TOO LATE, HUCKLEBERRY.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.408
(chuckles) HUCKLEBERRY.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.977
YOU KNOW WHY
IT HAPPENED, MAYA?

01:18.979 --> 01:20.379
ALL YOU DO IS CALL ME NAMES.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.947
I FINALLY STRUCK BACK ONCE.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.514
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU, WHO I WILL
DEAL WITH LATER.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.284
Boys: YEE.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.486
THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE
SHE STUCK UP FOR YOU.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.487
I DIDN'T STICK UP FOR HIM.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.988
YOU DIDN'T DISAGREE WITH HIM.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.390
HOW COULD SHE DISAGREE
WITH HIM, HE'S RIGHT?

01:31.392 --> 01:32.591
-YOU'RE NEXT!
-I WANT TO BE FIRST.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.461
Both: YEE.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.297
HE IS RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.466
WHY DOES THAT MEAN
SO MUCH TO EVERYBODY?

01:40.468 --> 01:43.402
WHEN BEING RIGHT
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN BEING FRIENDS...

01:44.338 --> 01:45.604
THEN THAT'S THE END
OF BEING FRIENDS.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.606
(bell rings)

01:55.049 --> 01:56.448
YEAH, NO CHANCE.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.688
IS THIS STILL
GOING ON?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.289
LOOK AT 'EM!

02:05.326 --> 02:06.391
YOWZAS!

02:07.361 --> 02:08.494
I'M MOVING MY SEAT.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.661
YEAH, YOU JUST DO THAT.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.015
MR. FRIAR?

02:13.016 --> 02:14.432
I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.068
I FINALLY CALLED HER
A NAME.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.402
SHE'S CALLED ME
A THOUSAND NAMES.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.437
I CALLED HER ONE NAME.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.505
MOVE.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.510
DO IT.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.447
HE'S UNDER MY PROTECTION.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.515
YOU WANT TO TANGLE WITH ME?

02:29.517 --> 02:30.582
NOT YET.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.119
MOVE.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.557
(giggles)

02:46.333 --> 02:47.599
WHY DIDN'T YOU
DISAGREE WITH HIM, RILEY?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.402
MAYA, HOW CAN I DISAGREE
WITH WHAT HE SAID

02:50.404 --> 02:52.404
IF WHAT HE SAID
WAS TRUE?

02:52.406 --> 02:54.757
IN LIFE, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS

02:54.758 --> 02:57.109
SOMETIMES ALL YOU NEED
IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE THERE
FOR YOU NO MATTER WHAT.

02:57.111 --> 02:59.077
WHAT HE SAID IS TRUE!

02:59.079 --> 03:00.445
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

03:00.447 --> 03:01.597
THEN I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

03:01.598 --> 03:02.748
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
IT WOULD WORK, WOULDN'T IT?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.483
NOT THE WAY
WE'RE DOING IT.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.353
OKAY, DARLINGS.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.354
IF EVERYONE WILL FOCUS
THEIR ATTENTION TO
THE FRONT OF THE ROOM...

03:10.357 --> 03:11.690
WAR.

03:13.127 --> 03:15.694
WORLD WARS CAN BEGIN
WITH A SINGLE GUNSHOT.

03:16.664 --> 03:20.465
AND WARS BETWEEN FRIENDS
CAN ALSO BEGIN
WITH AN ISOLATED EVENT.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.700
ONE TIME IN COLLEGE,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.468
ALL MY FRIENDS
HAD A WAR,

03:23.470 --> 03:24.636
AND IT WAS GREAT...

03:25.573 --> 03:27.105
UNTIL IT WASN'T.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.507
I WON'T LET IT
COME TO THAT, MR. MATTHEWS.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.508
NEITHER WILL I.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.060
-MAYA?
-WHAT?

03:31.061 --> 03:32.611
LET ME TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I AM NOT
GOING TO TALK TO YOU.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.745
YOU'RE PATHETIC AT THIS.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.551
WELL, WE'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.687
SORRY, GUYS, BUT I THINK THIS
IS GONNA TAKE SOMEONE A LITTLE
BETTER AT THIS THAN US.

03:41.689 --> 03:45.457
THIS IS GONNA TAKE
SOMEONE WITH A VERY
UNIQUE SET OF SKILLS.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.159
THIS IS GONNA TAKE...

03:47.161 --> 03:48.660
(bangs on door,
scratching)

03:51.599 --> 03:52.764
(scratching stops)

03:54.568 --> 03:56.602
(scratching resumes)

04:24.698 --> 04:26.598
I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.736
(shouts)
STRANGER!

04:37.645 --> 04:38.710
BAH!

04:40.581 --> 04:41.780
BAH BAH!

04:43.651 --> 04:46.451
(vocalizes fanfare)

04:48.455 --> 04:52.691
(continues vocalizing)

04:52.693 --> 04:54.526
Eric: OKAY!

RILEY!

05:51.852 --> 05:52.851
WHY'D YOU BLOW
THE WHISTLE?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.519
CAVEMAN!

05:54.855 --> 05:57.589
HONEY, IT'S
NOT A CAVEMAN.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.757
IT'S YOUR UNCLE ERIC.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.360
OKAY, IT'S A CAVEMAN.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.528
HONEY, REMEMBER ABOUT
YOUR UNCLE ERIC,

06:03.530 --> 06:04.730
SAME RULES WE TOLD YOU
AT THE ZOO.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.264
DON'T STAND TOO CLOSE,
DON'T FEED HIM,

06:06.266 --> 06:08.533
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT CALL HIM KOKO.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.603
OKAY, GIRLS.
HERE WE GO.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.609
AH, YOU MISSED
THE WHOLE PARADE.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.711
MY BROTHER!

06:19.713 --> 06:20.746
MY BROTHER!

06:20.748 --> 06:21.813
(both chuckle)

06:23.751 --> 06:24.816
HEY, ERIC.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.319
'PANGERS!
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

06:27.321 --> 06:28.620
-YEAH.
-HEY.

06:30.657 --> 06:31.823
HELLO, NICHE.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.558
UNCLE ERIC.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.826
LITTLE 'PANGERS!

06:36.697 --> 06:38.597
UNCLE ERIC!

06:38.599 --> 06:40.665
OH! OH! IT'S
COUSIN AUGGIE!

06:41.835 --> 06:43.335
HEY!

06:43.337 --> 06:44.770
HOW YOU DOIN', BUDDY?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.606
UNCLE ERIC, HOW COME
YOU LOOK LIKE THIS?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.574
BECAUSE THEY ELECTED
HIM MAYOR.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.609
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.577
THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF STUPIDTOWN.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.714
IT'S NOT PRONOUNCED STUPIDTOWN!

06:55.716 --> 06:56.715
HOW IS IT PRONOUNCED?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.650
ST. UPID TOWN.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.752
OH.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.921
HOW ST. UPID OF ME.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.810
I DON'T GET IT!

07:08.811 --> 07:09.860
AND YOU'RE THE MAYOR
OF ST. UPID TOWN?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.930
YES! I WAS
ELECTED IN A LANDSLIDE.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.900
SEE, AFTER THE LANDSLIDE,
EVERYBODY THAT WASN'T KILLED
VOTED FOR ME.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.904
IT'S A LOVELY LITTLE VILLAGE
RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF
NEW YORK AND FRANCE.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.872
NEW YORK DOESN'T EVEN
BORDER FRANCE.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.307
IT BORDERS CANADA.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.741
WELL, THEN WHY DO THEY
SPEAK FRENCH?

07:23.744 --> 07:25.744
WHY DON'T THEY
SPEAK CANADAHOO?

07:27.748 --> 07:28.880
IT'S QUEBEC.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.682
-THE JEOPARDY GUY?
-NO.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.617
WHO IS THE JEOPARDY GUY?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.618
NO.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.619
(chuckles)

07:34.621 --> 07:35.954
YOU HAVE A STUPID NAME.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.392
NO, SEE I LOOK LIKE THIS
BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE THIS.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.893
WHEN THEY ELECTED ME
MAYOR OF THEM,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.695
I WANTED THEM TO KNOW
THAT I WAS ONE OF THEM.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.630
I MEAN, PEOPLE GO NUTS
FOR THE WAY I LOOK.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.932
DO PEOPLE GO NUTS
FOR THE WAY YOU LOOK?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.867
I WORE HIGH-HEELS ONCE.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.769
PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.870
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.672
IT TAKES AWAY
YOUR VULNERABILITY.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.006
WELL, WE KNOW THAT NOW.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.376
ANYHOO,
I'VE BEEN SUMMONED.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.145
WHY HAVE I
BEEN BROUGHT TO HERE?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.913
BECAUSE CORY THINKS
WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING PEOPLE,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.782
YOU SOMEHOW TURN
INTO A GENIUS.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.784
I'M IN A FIGHT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.853
THERE WILL BE
NO LOSING FRIENDS.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.789
LOSE ONE FRIEND,

08:10.791 --> 08:11.957
LOSE ALL FRIENDS.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.959
LOSE YOURSELF.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.662
THAT'S GENIUS!

08:17.998 --> 08:19.397
I TOLD YOU.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.399
HAVE FAITH IN HIM.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.400
THEY DIDN'T ELECT YOU
JUST BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE THAT.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.738
NO, THEY ELECTED ME BECAUSE
PEOPLE TRUST ME ON THEIR ISSUES.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.906
I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THIS.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.809
EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME!

08:33.747 --> 08:35.013
OW!

08:42.689 --> 08:44.022
I CALLED IN MY BROTHER TO HELP

08:44.024 --> 08:46.858
BECAUSE NO ONE HERE
WANTS TO SEE YOUR BATTLE

08:46.860 --> 08:48.527
BECOME A WAR.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.195
AND ERIC'S REALLY
GOOD AT THIS,

08:50.196 --> 08:51.863
BECAUSE YOU WANNA BELIEVE
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE
GOOD AT SOMETHING.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.833
THANK YOU, TUBA.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.772
ERIC'S ALSO GOOD AT THIS
BECAUSE HE COMPLETELY KNOWS
HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.074
RIGHT.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.776
NOW...

09:05.846 --> 09:07.979
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS RILEY'S FRIEND, MOESHA?

09:11.485 --> 09:12.484
IT'S MAYA.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.485
OH, OKAY.

09:13.487 --> 09:14.920
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
FIGHTING ABOUT?

09:15.923 --> 09:16.922
SHE DIDN'T TAKE MY SIDE.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.841
I COULDN'T TAKE HER SIDE

09:18.842 --> 09:20.759
BASED ON WHAT WAS SAID,
WHICH IS THE PROBLEM

09:20.761 --> 09:23.461
WITH THIS WHOLE THING,
BECAUSE MAYA IS MAKING
TOO BIG OF A DEAL

09:23.463 --> 09:24.796
OF WHAT WAS SAID.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.765
UH-HUH, OKAY.
OKAY.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.099
NOW, WHICH ONE
WAS SHE?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.874
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.742
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOUR BEST FRIEND

09:37.744 --> 09:39.778
IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE PERSON YOU STAND UP FOR
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.046
OKAY...
(speaks gibberish)

09:41.048 --> 09:43.048
LOOK...
LISTEN, RILEY.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.883
(sighs) LOOK,

09:44.885 --> 09:46.885
IN MARGIE'S POINT OF VIEW...

09:47.955 --> 09:49.788
RIGHT AND WRONG
DON'T MATTER.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.957
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THE FRIENDSHIP.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.759
I JUST CAN'T SIDE
WITH HER THIS TIME.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.895
THIS TIME WE JUST CAN'T
GO INTO CANDY CANE WORLD.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.863
WE CAN'T JUST GO SKIPPING
OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE

09:58.865 --> 10:00.031
WITH OUR UNDERWEAR
ON OUR HEAD.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.867
YEAH. YEAH, I'M NOT
DOING THAT AGAIN.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.038
WHEN A REAL FRIEND COMES
INTO YOUR LIFE, I MEAN...

10:07.040 --> 10:09.941
IF ONE TRUE FRIEND
COMES THROUGH THIS WINDOW,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.043
THEN SOMETIMES TO PROTECT
THE FRIENDSHIP,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.112
THEN RIGHT AND WRONG,
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT THE WINDOW.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.547
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:15.549 --> 10:18.250
Both: NO.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.952
HONEY, I THINK ERIC'S EMPLOYING
A BROAD-BASED CONCEPT
OF VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP

10:20.954 --> 10:22.954
TAKING PRIORITY--

10:22.955 --> 10:24.955
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
EXPLAINING SOMETHING TO ME?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.158
NO.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.413
-YO, BOZO.
-YES?

10:31.414 --> 10:34.032
A TRUE FRIEND ALWAYS LETS
HER FRIEND KNOW WHAT SHE
IS REALLY THINKING.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.001
THAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF FRIENDSHIP.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.837
IS THERE ANYBODY HERE
WHO COULD POSSIBLY
DISAGREE WITH THAT?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.972
WELL, I THINK WHAT
ERIC'S TRYING--

10:40.974 --> 10:43.074
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.014
YEAH, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
NO ONE CAN ARGUE WITH
THERE, TOMATO?

10:49.016 --> 10:52.951
UM, WHEN I FINALLY HEAR
WHAT THIS ARGUMENT IS ABOUT,

10:52.953 --> 10:55.020
AND I FIX IT ALL UP
IN LIKE ONE SECOND.

10:55.022 --> 10:55.820
YEAH, OKAY, MALALA,
COME HERE.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.194
NOW, I NEED YOU TO TELL US
WHAT THIS FIGHT IS ABOUT,
SO I CAN FIX IT.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.065
LUCAS CALLED ME SHORT.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.934
FIX IT.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.836
YEAH, I CAN'T FIX THAT.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.073
ERIC, I BROUGHT YOU IN

11:15.074 --> 11:17.107
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I KNOW WHO CAN DO
THE IMPOSSIBLE.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.110
YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.845
FIX IT.

11:27.854 --> 11:28.920
(grunts)

11:35.062 --> 11:37.062
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE. STAY A HOBBIT.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.099
I'LL JUST FIX THIS ONE.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.206
(grunts)

11:53.146 --> 11:55.880
OKAY, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING IF NO ONE'S
GONNA HELP.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.018
LUCAS CALLED ME A SHORT
LITTLE STACK OF PANCAKES,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.953
AND RILEY DIDN'T SAY
I WASN'T.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.622
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
A SHORT LITTLE STACK
OF PANCAKES.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.957
OH, BOY.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.960
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
GROW ANYMORE.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.232
I MIGHT BE DONE, TOO.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.050
WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY
CAUSES OF WAR?

12:32.052 --> 12:34.252
YOU MAY BE WONDERING
WHY I'M--

12:34.254 --> 12:36.087
NOT NOW.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.657
FREEDOM.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.092
-RELIGION.
-PANCAKES.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.127
YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY...

12:42.129 --> 12:44.262
-NOT NOW!
-AH...

12:47.067 --> 12:48.066
CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.034
-WE'RE AT WAR, RILEY.
-WHY?

12:50.036 --> 12:53.171
BECAUSE WHEN I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU TO DEFEND ME,
I FELT AT PEACE.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.940
NOW, I'M NOT AT PEACE.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.708
MAYA, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHAT ANYBODY SAYS?

12:56.710 --> 12:58.894
BECAUSE EVEN IF I AM SHORT,

12:58.895 --> 13:01.079
I NEVER FELT LIKE I WAS
UNTIL YOU DIDN'T DISAGREE.

13:02.082 --> 13:06.117
IN ANY WAR, THE IMMEDIATE
DANGER IS ESCALATION
TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.285
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS ABOUT
RILEY AND MAYA.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.953
HOW COULD IT ESCAL--

13:12.225 --> 13:13.324
I GET IT NOW.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.096
RIGHT. SO,
IN ORDER TO AVOID THAT,

13:18.098 --> 13:22.167
THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE
TO BRING IN A MEDIATING BODY,
LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.235
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY SAID NO,

13:24.237 --> 13:29.107
SO I'VE DECIDED TO BRING IN
A RESPECTED INTELLECT
FROM THE NORTH.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.350
(whispers)
NOW, ERIC!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.321
OWW!

13:47.260 --> 13:49.260
NOW, WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY?

13:49.262 --> 13:52.063
Kids:
YOU MAY WONDER WHAT IT IS

13:52.065 --> 13:53.064
YEAH?

13:53.066 --> 13:55.033
Kids:
...I'M DOING HERE.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.201
UH-HUH.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.236
WHO IS THIS GUY?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.373
WELL, THIS GUY
IS MY BROTHER ERIC,

14:02.375 --> 14:05.109
AND, TO BE HONEST,
THERE'S NO ONE THAT
I TRUST MORE

14:05.111 --> 14:06.344
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ART
OF MEDIATION.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.112
MEDIATION.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.216
SITTING CROSS-LEGGED
GOING OHM...

14:12.352 --> 14:15.153
...MY LEGS ARE KILLING ME.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.193
RIGHT, SO, IT'S CERTAINLY
NO SECRET THAT WAR HAS
BROKEN OUT AMONG US.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.196
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
AN INTERESTING LESSON
FOR YOU GUYS TO SEE

14:25.198 --> 14:29.067
HOW RATIONAL AND CARING PEOPLE
CAN BRING WAR TO AN END.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.135
DAD, ARE YOU SURE?

14:31.137 --> 14:34.105
YEAH. HE'S GOT THIS.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.182
UH, ERIC, ERIC?

14:44.184 --> 14:46.184
YOU DO HAVE THIS, RIGHT?
I MEAN...

14:46.186 --> 14:49.220
I KNOW WE MESS AROUND A LOT,
BUT THE STAKES ARE KIND OF
HIGH ON THIS ONE.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.523
LOOK, I JUST WANNA THANK YOU
FOR BELIEVING IN ME.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.096
-MY BROTHER.
-MY BROTHER.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.902
OKAY, I NEED THERE TO BE
AS MANY PEOPLE AROUND
AS POSSIBLE FOR THIS.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.049
WHY?

15:06.050 --> 15:08.195
WELL, AS MAYOR, I'M AROUND
OTHER PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

15:08.196 --> 15:10.341
WHEN YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
THEM, YOU GET THAT EVERYBODY
HAS THE SAME THING IN COMMON.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.079
NOW, HERE WE HAVE
TWO FRIENDS AT WAR.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.180
WHY?

15:16.182 --> 15:17.348
WHO FIRED
THE FIRST SHOT?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.118
I CALLED MAYA
A SHORT STACK OF PANCAKES.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.087
OKAY, NOW WAS THAT REALLY
THE FIRST SHOT, OR DID MAYA
CALL YOU ANYTHING

15:23.089 --> 15:24.122
TO MAKE YOU SAY THAT
TO HER?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.241
SHE CALLED ME "HUCKLEBERRY."

15:26.242 --> 15:28.359
THERE'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY
I MAY HAVE CALLED HIM
"RANGER RICK" ONCE.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.212
ONCE?

15:31.213 --> 15:33.096
OH, YEAH, "RANGER ROY" ONCE,
"RANGER RICK" IS EVERY DAY.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.200
OH, DON'T FORGET ABOUT
"BUCKY McBOING-BOING."

15:36.202 --> 15:38.136
OH, THAT WAS A FUN DAY.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.204
OH, AND SHE COMES UP
TO MY FACE AND GOES,

15:40.206 --> 15:41.306
-HA...
-HURR...

15:41.308 --> 15:43.174
LIKE IT'S THE WAY
I TALK.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.176
OH. OKAY, NOW
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.277
BECAUSE HE LETS ME.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.279
OH. WELL, WHY DO YOU LET HER?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.281
YEAH, I'D LIKE
TO KNOW THAT MYSELF.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.217
AND ALL HE DO IS CALL YOU
A SHORT STACK OF PANCAKES,
AND YOU'RE MAD AT HIM?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.219
I'M NOT MAD AT HIM.
I'M MAD AT HER.

15:55.221 --> 15:59.157
I'M SORRY, MAYA, BUT HOW CAN
I POSSIBLY DEFEND YOU FROM
HOW TALL YOU ARE?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.459
THE SAME WAY I DEFEND YOU
FROM HOW TALL YOU ARE.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.961
WHAT?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.363
LET'S SAY SOMEBODY HERE
CALLED YOU...

16:05.365 --> 16:07.265
I DON'T KNOW,
"RILEY SUPERKLUTZ."

16:07.267 --> 16:08.399
WHAT?

16:08.401 --> 16:10.201
IT'S OKAY, RILEY.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.437
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU GOT
THESE BIG OLD GAWKY LEGS
AND ARMS

16:12.439 --> 16:14.906
THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY
IN SUCH GOOD CONTROL
OF YET.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.375
SO, MAYBE SOMETIMES
YOU DON'T WALK AROUND SO GOOD.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.376
DO I DO THAT A LOT?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.878
NO, BUT SOMETIMES
YOU DO THIS.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.146
(laughing)

16:22.148 --> 16:24.415
HEY! NOBODY LAUGHS
AT HER BUT ME.

16:28.455 --> 16:32.323
I'VE NEVER ONCE HEARD ANYBODY
CALL ME "RILEY SUPERKLUTZ."

16:32.325 --> 16:34.258
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
HAD YOUR BACK.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.228
THAT'S HOW YOU ALL SEE ME?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.463
Kids: YEAH.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.300
OKAY, WELL,
THAT KIND OF HURTS.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.434
WHY DOES IT HURT?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.203
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE, RILEY.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.437
SOME OF THESE THINGS
ARE TRUE ABOUT US.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.340
BUT, YOU DEFENDED ME?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.175
OF COURSE I DEFENDED YOU.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.410
EVEN WHEN IT WAS TRUE?

16:52.412 --> 16:53.511
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.948
WHY?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.216
WHY WHAT?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.350
WHY DOESN'T IT MATTER?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.020
'CAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.255
-I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
-BECAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS!

17:04.257 --> 17:06.557
I STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU.
SOMETHING'S WRONG!

17:13.199 --> 17:15.266
THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS, ERIC.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.968
THEY REALIZE THAT.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.336
YOU DID IT.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.370
NO.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.505
NO?

17:20.507 --> 17:22.473
NO, WE KNEW THAT ALREADY.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.308
THAT'S NOT IT.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.210
THIS GOES DEEPER.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.545
DO YOU THINK
I'M A SUPERKLUTZ?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.313
YEAH.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.515
DO YOU THINK
I'M SUPER SHORT?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.583
I THINK YOU'RE
REGULAR SHORT.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.354
THANKS.

17:36.356 --> 17:40.491
SO, YOU KNEW THAT EVERYBODY
WAS CALLING ME THIS, BUT YOU
DIDN'T TELL ME?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.427
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.263
WELL, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.301
I'D JOIN YOU,
BUT I'M ALREADY DOWN HERE.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.440
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT?

17:55.442 --> 17:57.575
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
ADMITTED THIS BEFORE,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.311
BUT SOMETIMES I WONDER IF
MY DESIRE FOR WORLD DOMINATION

18:00.313 --> 18:03.381
ACTUALLY COMES
FROM DEEP DOWN FEELING
LIKE I'M SQUEAKY THE MOUSE.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.416
WHAT MAKES
YOU FEEL LIKE THAT?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.551
-YOU DO.
-HOW?

18:06.553 --> 18:09.253
JUST BY BEING ALIVE,
YOU FREAK!

18:10.356 --> 18:11.355
I'M A FREAK?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.374
LOOK AT YOU!

18:13.375 --> 18:15.392
LOOK AT YOUR FREAK FACE,
AND YOUR FREAK HAIR.
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

18:16.529 --> 18:18.563
HEY, YOU THINK THIS IS EASY?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.431
YOU THINK IT'S EASY BEING
ME EVERY DAY?

18:20.433 --> 18:21.632
(in unison)
SHUT UP!

18:22.602 --> 18:24.268
YEAH, OKAY.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.404
ONE DOLLAR TO LOOK
AT THE FREAK.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.340
OH, BE QUIET, FLAT BUTT.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.608
WHAT?

18:32.011 --> 18:34.312
REALLY? I HAD NO IDEA.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.302
YOU GOT THIS?

18:41.303 --> 18:43.553
YEAH, THE PEOPLE ELECTED ME
MAYOR BECAUSE THEY TRUST ME
WITH THEIR ISSUES.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.289
YOU MEAN POLITICAL ISSUES?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.458
NOPE. DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.062
NO, THEY TRUST ME
WITH THEIR PEOPLE ISSUES,

18:51.064 --> 18:53.297
WHICH, IT TURNS OUT
EVERYBODY HAS,

18:53.299 --> 18:55.666
AND THEY ALL SEEM TO SHOW UP
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.505
THE ENEMY'S
NOT EACH OTHER, GUYS.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.374
YOU'RE ALL GOING THROUGH
THE SAME THING.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.376
IT'S PART OF GROWING UP.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.345
I'M A KLUTZ.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.412
I'M A PANCAKE.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.348
-SQUEAK.
-FREAK.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.383
THAT'S WHY IT HURTS TO SIT.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.523
WELL, WHAT A BUNCH
OF WEIRDOS WE ARE.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.398
GUESS I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO GET USED TO GOING THROUGH
LIFE LOOKING UP AT PEOPLE,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.433
AND PEOPLE
LOOKING DOWN AT ME.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.403
AND I'M JUST GOING
TO SIT HERE AND NEVER MOVE.

19:35.608 --> 19:39.110
I THINK IT'S ABOUT GOING
THROUGH LIFE WITH THE RIGHT
ATTITUDE, GIRLS.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.512
I MEAN, I THINK WE NEED
TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE
FOR WHO THEY ARE,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.464
NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.415
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY OUR
CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD
AND TO EACH OTHER

19:45.418 --> 19:47.452
THAT GIVES US
ANY REAL STATURE.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.487
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
EVERYBODY LOOKS UP TO YOU.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.557
BECAUSE YOU'RE THIS
BRILLIANT, STRONG,
AMAZON WARRIOR.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.360
OH, REALLY?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.129
WHOA, YOU'RE A SHRIMP.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.430
YEAH.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.449
-YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS?
-YEAH.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.467
-YOU'RE NOT JUST
DOING THIS FOR ME?
-NO, MAYA, THIS IS ME.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.436
BUT, YOU'RE THE FIERCEST
WOMAN I KNOW.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.522
AND SO ARE YOU.

20:07.523 --> 20:09.607
HONEY, A COUPLE OF SHORT
STACKS OF PANCAKES LIKE US
CAN DO JUST FINE.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.710
AND A SUPERKLUTZ!

20:16.516 --> 20:17.332
-WHOA!
-UGH...

20:17.333 --> 20:18.149
YOU FEELING ANY BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.483
YEAH.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.586
HOW ABOUT YOU, RILEY?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.521

20:30.597 --> 20:32.396

20:32.398 --> 20:34.565
I THINK WHEN THERE'S
A WHOLE WORLD OF PEOPLE
OUT THERE

20:34.567 --> 20:36.667
WHO MIGHT SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE

20:36.669 --> 20:39.103
OR THE WAY YOU LOOK,

20:39.104 --> 20:41.538
IT'S AREAL GOOD IDEA
TO HAVE FRIENDS WHO WILL
DEFEND YOU NO MATTER WHAT.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.609

20:46.662 --> 20:48.712
YOU'RE WELCOME,
YOU FIERCE AMAZON WARRIOR.

20:50.183 --> 20:52.416
YOU KNOW, IF YOU JUST LET ME
MESS YOU UP A LITTLE BIT,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.452
I THINK YOU'D BE A LOT
MORE RELATABLE TO PEOPLE.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.487
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.793
OKAY?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.695
HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU BETTER?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.799
SERIOUSLY, DOES IT NOT HURT
ANYONE ELSE TO SIT?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.603
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, ERIC.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.539
PEOPLE WHO UNDERESTIMATE YOU
ARE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.475
CORY WAS RIGHT TO HAVE
FAITH IN YOU.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.544
YOU REALLY ARE A MATURE,
NORMAL HUMAN BEING.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.480
I AM NOT!

21:23.716 --> 21:24.782
NEVER MIND.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.719
WHOA, WHAT'S THAT?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.588
THAT'S MY UNCLE ERIC,

21:30.590 --> 21:32.590
MAYOR.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.692
HE'S GREAT
WITH THE ISSUES.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.761
THE PEOPLE IN FRANCE
ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.564
YEAH, I GOTTA SAY,
YOU DID REALLY WELL FOR US.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.799
THANK YOU, MORDECAI.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.469
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.737
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT TAKING OVER THE WORLD?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.773
WORLD, YOU SAY?

21:48.775 --> 21:52.209
YEAH, UH, FORTUNATELY,
THE WORLD HAS PROTECTIVE
MECHANISMS IN PLACE

21:52.211 --> 21:53.678
THAT WOULD NEVER
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.814
YES. FORTUNATELY.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.556
SCANDAL ROCKS
WASHINGTON TODAY,

22:05.558 --> 22:08.659
AS JEFFERSON DAVIS GRAHAM,
LONG-TIME SENATOR FROM NEW YORK

22:08.661 --> 22:11.495
DID SOMETHING
SO INCREDIBLY STUPID,

22:11.497 --> 22:15.533
HIS CHANCE AT RE-ELECTION
IS, LIKE, ZERO.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.570
UNLESS THEY CAN SOMEHOW PULL
AN EVEN BIGGER BLOCKHEAD
OUT OF THE WOODS

22:19.572 --> 22:21.639
TO RUN AGAINST HIM.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.707
BUT, EVEN IN AMERICAN POLITICS,
THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.578
We'll be back after this
with sports and weather.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.580
FACE IT, WE'RE FINISHED.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.715
THERE ISN'T A GUY
IN THE UNIVERSE

22:30.717 --> 22:32.717
COULDN'T BEAT OUR CANDIDATE
RIGHT NOW.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.652
TOO GOOD. WINNER.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.521
OH, HE BEATS US. SHE BEATS US.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.590
WHOA!

22:39.592 --> 22:41.759

22:43.563 --> 22:45.830
YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA.
