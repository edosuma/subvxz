00:57.655 --> 01:01.193
- Take your time, Justin.
- I'm fucking trying.

02:11.330 --> 02:14.430
Fuck!

02:26.580 --> 02:29.149
If it pleases Your Honor,
as Miss Bucknell's crime

02:29.249 --> 02:33.387
has been fueled by ongoing
methamphetamine and alcohol abuse,

02:33.487 --> 02:37.658
the report does recommend
ongoing treatment at Tiaki Wairua.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.628
This... It's a new facility. It offers
courses in anger management,

02:41.728 --> 02:44.865
substance abuse, social disorders.

02:44.965 --> 02:50.715
They also teach basic job skills and
life skills like cooking, cleaning,

02:52.016 --> 02:54.141
- budgeting.
- With respect, Mr. Hollis,

02:54.241 --> 02:58.412
your client has been through a number
of these treatment programs in the past,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.682
and as the events of the last
week probably would testify,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.051
the results have been
less than spectacular.

03:04.151 --> 03:08.055
Now, I agree with you that Miss
Bucknell is in need of rehabilitation,

03:08.155 --> 03:09.990
but she is also in need of stability.

03:10.090 --> 03:13.894
I therefore ordering an urgent report into
the suitability of her mother's house

03:13.994 --> 03:17.498
at 57 Lynfield Road for a sentence
of eight months home detention.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.699
Thank you. Stand down.

04:05.178 --> 04:08.280
Do you want a few minutes
before we come in?

04:31.071 --> 04:35.175
God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even see you there.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.946
I think that there's more damage to mine,
though, than there is to yours.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.315
Oh, yes, that just clips
on like that, does it?

04:41.415 --> 04:42.816
Yep. That's all good to go.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.619
Now, in the event that there's
an unauthorized absence,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.154
you'll get a call to the modem.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.957
If you don't respond, an officer
will be dispatched straightaway.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.226
The bracelet has a fiber
optic cable inside it.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.295
So if you try to break
it or if you damage it,

04:55.395 --> 04:56.997
a tamper signal will be
sent out immediately.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.966
Gosh, that's high-tech, isn't it?
Aren't you lucky, Kylie?

05:00.066 --> 05:04.036
Having all that fancy technology
on your foot. Quite spoilt.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.176
Keep coming.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.311
Keep coming.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.812
Keep coming.

05:15.842 --> 05:17.483
Breach.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.202
That's a flash phone, Kylie.
Is that one of those iPhones?

05:35.302 --> 05:37.504
- No.
- Flash, isn't it?

05:38.456 --> 05:40.149
- Not really.
- See that, Graeme?

05:40.249 --> 05:43.388
- Kylie's got one of those iPhones.
- It's not an iPhone.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.260
That Leslie's a lovely
wee girl, isn't she?

05:49.074 --> 05:52.103
I was just saying to Kylie, Graeme, the wee
Maori girl who gave Kylie a ride home,

05:52.203 --> 05:56.123
she's very nice. Very well-spoken.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.858
She was very well-spoken,
wasn't she, Kylie?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.493
- She's a probation officer.
- Oh.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.128
Still, it's nice to
meet an educated one.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.630
God, you should see some
of the ones outside the TAB.

06:03.730 --> 06:07.468
10:00 in the morning, they're lining up
to play the pokies, o shoes on their feet.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.403
Half of them have got kids with them.
No shoes on their feet either.

06:28.355 --> 06:32.023
Welcome to the prepaid
top-up menu. To...

07:05.758 --> 07:06.960
Yes.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.230
Well, no. Look,
'cause she just wouldn't.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.886
No, you wouldn't read about it.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.502
I need to use the phone.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.205
Hang on a second, Jocelyn.
In a minute, Kylie. I'm on the phone.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.873
That's what I'm saying.
I need to use it.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.343
Well, it'll have to wait.
This is a very important call.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.612
Sorry, Jocelyn. What were you saying?

07:26.012 --> 07:29.548
Well, I don't know. I think
it's been going on for years.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.453
Because I ran into him at the
Pak'nSave and I said to him

07:33.553 --> 07:36.556
I said, "How's things," and he said,
"Oh, yeah, bit of a domestic."

07:38.425 --> 07:41.161
I know that's what he said.
"Bit of a domestic."

07:41.261 --> 07:42.829
Well, that's what
he's like, isn't it?

07:42.929 --> 07:46.198
Yeah. He is. He's a right hard case.

07:54.616 --> 07:56.157
...both locally and internationally

07:56.257 --> 07:58.578
and safe to clean any exterior
surface around your home.

Or phone 0800-30-3000.

08:08.328 --> 08:10.298
And now, Andrew Dickens.

08:10.398 --> 08:14.961
Call 0800-8010-80... on Newstalk ZB.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.397
It's open line talk back
with Andrew Dickens.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.899
Good evening, Miriam. How are ya?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.935
Yes, thanks, Andrew.
I was actually listening before,

08:22.035 --> 08:24.571
and you had a lady talking about
ghosts and supernatural things.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.474
Oh, right. Yes, yes. We weren't
talking about cognitive bias,

08:27.574 --> 08:30.310
which is where the brain deviates
from logical thought into fallacy.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.147
It explains why people allow themselves to
interpret everyday things as paranormal.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.216
I just think she didn't know
what she was talking about,

08:36.316 --> 08:39.025
because I've had things happen to me
like that, and it has got nothing to do

08:39.125 --> 08:41.655
- with a deviation in the brain.
- Okay, what sort of things?

08:41.755 --> 08:43.924
Well, for as long as
I've lived in this house,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.559
we've had all sorts
of stuff going on.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.461
We've heard noises in
the middle of the night.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.996
We've had things moving
about by themselves.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.065
We've had, fluctuations
in the power bills.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.534
Now, I'm not sure that qualifies
as bulletproof evidence.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.170
But, see, I think that's the thing.
I think that's part of it.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.440
And they do that on purpose so that you
don't know if you're imagining it or not.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.643
- Yeah, well.
- Having said all that,

09:02.743 --> 09:06.613
there was one incident in particular that
I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

09:06.713 --> 09:09.983
took place in the real world
and not in my imagination.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.452
There was one this night,
and I was in the basement

09:12.552 --> 09:14.321
getting a chicken out of the freezer.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.760
I was just bending over and
getting it out, and all of a sudden,

09:17.860 --> 09:21.728
I got what I can only describe
as an enormous sense of dread.

09:21.828 --> 09:25.265
Like, every hair on my
body was standing upright.

09:25.365 --> 09:30.822
And I turned around, and I saw this
thing disappear back into the darkness.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.574
- God, you must have been petrified.
- Yes. I was out of there like a shot.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.310
It took me two months to work up the
nerve to go back down there again.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.679
So can you describe
what it looked like?

09:39.779 --> 09:43.723
W... It happened very,
very quickly. But,

09:43.823 --> 09:46.353
Oh, gosh, what was it like?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.388
It was sort of like a
white sheet or something,

09:48.488 --> 09:52.459
but it was sort of...
tattered and faded.

09:52.559 --> 09:57.230
But look, I've never seen it since,
and I hope I never do. Touch wood.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.634
But to this day, I don't
know how to explain it.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.204
Yes, well, I'm not sure I do either Miriam,
but thank you so much for your call.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.938
Open line...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.617
Finished with the phone?

10:23.023 --> 10:26.925
Psychic hotline's just opened.
Maybe you wanna give them a call.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.563
White sheet. That's original.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.535
Would you mind putting
that cigarette out, please?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.902
We don't smoke in the house.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.382
You honestly think
this house is haunted?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.030
I don't want to get into
this with you, Kylie.

10:51.130 --> 10:53.019
Obviously, you're just
going to make fun of me.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.388
There's nothing funny about
having a mother with dementia.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.657
You realize they put me on house
arrest to get some stability.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.426
Well, obviously, you've got
a very selective memory.

11:02.143 --> 11:03.530
What's that supposed to mean?

11:03.630 --> 11:06.132
I'm not the only one who thought
there was a ghost in this house, Kylie.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.401
In fact, you used to be so
terrified you couldn't sleep.

11:08.501 --> 11:13.071
Yeah, I also use to think the moon was
made of cheese. It's called childhood.

12:34.382 --> 12:36.242
Kylie.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.560
Kylie, it's half past 11:00.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.216
- Oh, no. I'm gonna be late.
- What for?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.273
Nothing.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.125
Nice being back home?

14:54.181 --> 14:57.054
Least there's plenty of space to
run around. Big place like this.

14:58.706 --> 15:00.356
- How's things with your mum?
- Great.

15:00.456 --> 15:03.136
- She seems like a nice lady.
- She's a fucking dick.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.961
Well, I think that's a
bit unfair. I mean...

15:06.061 --> 15:08.508
letting you come back home couldn't
have been an easy decision to make.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.343
This isn't my home.

15:10.443 --> 15:14.247
Okay, but considering you're going
to be spending a lot of time together,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.115
don't you think you should
be making more of an effort?

15:16.215 --> 15:17.849
No.

15:24.891 --> 15:29.229
- What's the situation with Graeme?
- He's a cabbage in a polar fleece.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.030
- What's he doing for work?
- I don't fuckin' know.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.266
He's around here somewhere.
Why don't you go and ask him?

15:33.847 --> 15:36.014
What about your real father?

15:38.015 --> 15:42.392
Miriam says he runs a boat
brokerage on the Gold Coast.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.011
Done quite well for himself.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.448
New life. New family. But...

15:48.548 --> 15:51.117
she says he doesn't stay in touch.

15:51.914 --> 15:53.590
- Have you ever considered...
- I'm giving you two more minutes

15:53.690 --> 15:56.390
and then I'm turning the TV back on.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.393
This watch was handed down
from my great-grandfather.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.764
He was the owner of the St. Paul
Pioneer Press and Dispatch

16:04.864 --> 16:11.031
back in 1914, when he received this
watch, and it was handed down

16:11.131 --> 16:15.008
to my father and then he gave
it to me. It's a beautiful watch.

16:15.108 --> 16:19.846
It's manufactured by the Patek-Phillipe
company of Geneva, Switzerland.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.382
This is a photocopy of
the original warranty,

16:22.482 --> 16:26.252
depicting some of the
complications of this watch.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.887
You let the fire go out.

16:27.987 --> 16:33.791
...the front of the watch has the hour
and minute hand and the second hand.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.302
Kylie, where's that meat loaf?

16:47.140 --> 16:49.942
- I made that for tonight.
- Well, I've eaten it.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.544
- A whole meat loaf?
- No.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.911
The whole thing's gutted.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.479
So I suppose I'll have to go
back to the supermarket

16:59.579 --> 17:03.120
- and get something else for tea then?
- Well, I can't go, can I?

17:05.790 --> 17:11.788
This watch, at auction, I suspect, would
bring close to a quarter million dollars.

17:11.887 --> 17:14.232
- No.
- Yes.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.003
That was your watch,
and to the police,

17:20.104 --> 17:22.108
that clue's a homing pigeon.
Comes right back to you.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.011
I'll take care of Romo and
find out who he's working for.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.779
I'm the detective.

17:28.144 --> 17:30.206
Kylie?

17:32.485 --> 17:34.454
Kylie,

17:34.654 --> 17:37.857
Thursdays and Fridays are
Coronation Street nights.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.293
Now, it's only for an hour.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.564
But it starts at 7:30.
And it's almost 7:30 now.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.709
Your gonna write this to
the Globe. Now, listen.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.204
Kylie, please.

17:51.304 --> 17:55.074
What's important? Who are you?
How did you get in here?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.180
Exactly at 9:30?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.448
You have no right to take him.

18:06.054 --> 18:09.925
Oh, for God's sake.
I can't even hear it.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.393
I mean, why should we
be in here? It's our house.

18:18.595 --> 18:21.149
You know, you could
say something to her.

18:21.941 --> 18:24.218
Tell you one thing, I'm not gonna
spend the next eight months

18:24.318 --> 18:29.208
as a prisoner in my own home.
No way, buster.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.678
She'll learn.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.081
One way or another, she'll have to.

18:35.381 --> 18:39.485
- How long is the workout?
- Forty-five minutes a day, for 90 days.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.269
No need to spend countless
hours at the gym.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.866
- Tapout will even show you how to eat.
- Oh, that's good, isn't it?

18:43.966 --> 18:46.059
And it's not a lot of time
each day to get results.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.695
So, Lou, come on.
What's your favorite move?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.797
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.298
Left jab. Right jab.

18:52.398 --> 18:56.135
Left hook. Right upper.
Left, right, left. Boom. Boom.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.872
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Finish it with a kick! Are you ready?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.840
- Bang!
- Missed the last bit, but never mind.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.142
If you're serious about losing
weight, then this is for you.

19:41.080 --> 19:46.617
If you want a Tapout body, you have
to come and get it. Come on. Boom!

20:16.014 --> 20:18.316
Hello, Mortar.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.181
Hello, Mortar.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.697
Hello, Mortar.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.711
Hello, Mortar.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.502
Jesus.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.338
Let me just explain a couple
of things to you, Kylie.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.240
Some of us have to go
to work in the morning.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.642
Now, I realize being here is
an inconvenience for you,

22:56.742 --> 22:59.045
but that doesn't mean you have to be
an inconvenience to everybody else.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.779
There's someone down there.
We need to call the police.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.364
You can do what you like.
I'm going back to sleep.

23:09.220 --> 23:12.055
- Where's Graeme?
- He's on the night shift.

23:12.155 --> 23:14.392
He's on the night shift.

23:43.456 --> 23:47.024
I can't stay like this
for long, Kylie. My knees.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.542
That was a gift from your Uncle Melvin.
It's genuine Cameroon.

24:03.642 --> 24:06.677
Good, then it won't break.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.193
Is anyone here?

24:31.036 --> 24:34.006
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. It's just me.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.475
- What are you doing here?
- I got a break signal.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.544
Oh, what you just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.680
No. I live in the neighborhood.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.818
Looks like he's taken off already.

25:20.518 --> 25:22.254
What was he... What did he look like?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.489
I told you I didn't get
a good look at him.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.024
- What was he wearing?
- I don't know.

25:30.023 --> 25:33.365
Look, I came down to look for
my phone. My bracelet went off.

25:33.465 --> 25:36.265
Somebody grabbed my leg,
but I only saw his hand.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.671
- How come your bracelet went off?
- Why are you asking me?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.135
Why don't you tell him
what you really saw?

25:40.235 --> 25:43.475
- Why don't you shut up?
- I'm sorry, Amos.

25:43.575 --> 25:47.328
It's just that this house is
prone to certain disturbances.

25:47.428 --> 25:49.281
- Mum.
- What do you mean?

25:49.381 --> 25:54.784
Well, there may be one or two occupants
who haven't quite left the premises.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.612
No, I'm sorry. I still
don't get what you mean.

25:58.712 --> 26:00.759
Well...

26:00.859 --> 26:03.962
Obviously, my daughter and I have
a difference of opinion on the matter.

26:04.062 --> 26:08.467
But based on personal experience,
I have what I feel...

26:08.567 --> 26:12.600
is some reason to believe
that the house...

26:12.737 --> 26:15.347
could, in fact, be,

26:15.507 --> 26:17.073
you know,

26:18.643 --> 26:20.276
haunted.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.846
Really?

26:33.091 --> 26:35.794
This is the record I.D. for the
house of Kylie and Miriam Bucknell.

26:35.894 --> 26:41.233
The date is the 18th of March, 2013.
The time, 2:30 a.m.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.300
What are you doing?

26:52.437 --> 26:56.228
To the restless spirit that lives in
this house, what is your business here?

27:06.124 --> 27:09.993
Did you leave this world
not of your own free will?

27:19.071 --> 27:23.774
Is there anyone here today
you want to communicate with?

27:27.713 --> 27:30.513
You honestly think
somebody's gonna answer?

27:31.582 --> 27:34.283
Maybe they already have.

27:38.390 --> 27:42.759
To the restless spirit that lives in
this house, what is your business here?

27:50.803 --> 27:54.305
Did you leave this world
not of your own free will?

28:02.347 --> 28:06.883
Is there anyone here today
you want to communicate with?

28:16.895 --> 28:19.529
Do you honestly think
somebody's gonna...

28:20.698 --> 28:22.963
I'll run that through a
filter when I get home.

28:23.063 --> 28:24.664
- You mentioned some disturbances?
- Yes.

28:24.764 --> 28:26.564
Banging on the walls,
knocking on the pipes?

28:26.664 --> 28:29.842
- Taps turning on and off, that kind of thing?
- Oh, day and night.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.012
I mean the furnace could account for
some of the banging if it actually went,

28:33.112 --> 28:36.081
but the thing's been
busted for years.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.783
It's colder in here. You notice that?

28:37.883 --> 28:41.487
Yeah. No, we tried to get it
going again, but it's so old.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.756
You just can't get parts for it.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.592
I'd say it's dropped another
four degrees, at least.

28:46.692 --> 28:48.627
We were supposed to get
one of those heat pumps.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.797
But then they went and cut
the blimmen, whatchamacallit.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.234
- How long have you lived here?
- Oh, about 20 years now.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.724
What do you know about
the previous owners?

28:56.824 --> 29:00.139
Not much I'm afraid. It was my
ex-husband who bought the place.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.776
But the lady who was here before
us lived here for quite some time.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.211
We never dealt with her though.
She passed away.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.046
- How did she die?
- Pardon?

29:08.146 --> 29:11.116
- How did she die?
- Oh, she was quite old, I think.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.619
Yeah. No, she used to run a B&B.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.322
Actually, I thought about doing that
myself with the place at one time.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.024
You were going to run a B&B?

29:19.124 --> 29:21.960
I have wanted to do other things with my
life besides put up with your nonsense.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.264
- Who would want a holiday in Bulford?
- We live on the Twin Coast Highway, Kylie.

29:25.364 --> 29:29.399
- Lots of tourists drive through here.
- Yeah, at warp fucking speed.

29:32.101 --> 29:35.808
So what I'd like to do now, Miriam, we'll
kick this operation off into phase two.

29:35.908 --> 29:39.211
We'll start with a daisy chain of EMF
readers, microphones, data loggers,

29:39.311 --> 29:42.247
and then, if it's okay with you, we'll
set up some closed-circuit surveillance,

29:42.347 --> 29:44.450
see if we can't figure out
exactly what we're dealing with.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.785
Oh. Well, I appreciate
you trying to help, Amos.

29:46.885 --> 29:50.088
It's just... I don't think I can
actually afford to pay for all that.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.324
Please, Miriam,
this is a pro bono gig.

29:52.424 --> 29:56.026
It's the advancement of paranormal
research that's reward enough.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.866
Just be careful if you're putting
nails in that wall, Amos,

30:00.966 --> 30:03.554
'cause the last time Graeme
tried to put a shelf up in here,

30:03.654 --> 30:06.381
- he actually hit a power cable.
- Thanks for the concern, Miriam,

30:06.481 --> 30:09.405
but I always check the circuit's
off before an installa...

30:09.775 --> 30:11.743
Oh. Shit.

30:11.843 --> 30:13.576
Are you all right?

30:14.145 --> 30:16.345
Did you hurt yourself?

30:18.015 --> 30:22.853
At some stage... you just might
want to get your wiring checked.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.932
What are you doing now?

30:34.132 --> 30:36.969
Just getting a baseline
reading for the data loggers.

30:37.069 --> 30:41.106
- What are they supposed to log?
- Fluctuations in room temperature.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.708
Ghosts have a lower body
temperature than humans.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.543
Do they?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.473
Yeah, they do.

30:47.573 --> 30:50.415
You know, the closed mind is the worst
defense against the paranormal, Kylie.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.317
What are you gonna do
against a hostile spirit?

30:52.417 --> 30:55.909
- You just gonna crack jokes?
- No, I'm going to smash it in the face.

30:57.227 --> 30:59.949
You cannot punch ectoplasm.

31:20.512 --> 31:24.915
Nice. You know, I can still see you.

31:43.134 --> 31:46.236
I can hear you breathing.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.813
The fuck did you just say?

32:01.187 --> 32:03.738
Stop tickling me.

32:13.865 --> 32:17.234
I just want to be friends.

32:24.743 --> 32:29.980
I could never do that to my friend.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.424
Could you give that a shake,
please, Miriam?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.777
- What about the cameras?
- Checked the cameras remotely.

33:32.877 --> 33:33.846
- And?
- And what?

33:33.946 --> 33:36.515
Spend eight hours waiting for a
teddy bear to crawl out of a fireplace.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.551
- It was pretty uneventful.
- You think I'm making this up.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.219
Honestly, I don't know.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.522
But unless I have reason to think
otherwise, I have to remain skeptical.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.758
Skeptical? The other night you were
practically creaming your pants.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.461
And you thought it was all a big joke.
Interesting turn of events.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.298
Hey. I've got better things to do with
my time than make up ghost stories.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.932
Sure you do.

34:09.347 --> 34:12.083
Our brains are made up
of cells called neurons.

34:12.184 --> 34:15.219
These cells have nerve
endings called synapses.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.690
Synapses release chemical
and electrical stimuli

34:18.790 --> 34:22.293
which communicate with each
other to form neuropath ways.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.996
- Now, if we...
- How long have you been a counselor?

34:25.596 --> 34:29.835
Oh. Gosh... 15, 16 years.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.668
A few years of study prior to that.

34:34.065 --> 34:37.092
So you got, like, a diploma?

34:37.193 --> 34:40.377
A doctorate in clinical psychology.

34:44.181 --> 34:47.050
My mum thinks this house is haunted.

34:51.289 --> 34:53.623
And what do you think?

34:56.228 --> 34:59.240
Some things have happened
since I've been here.

35:01.357 --> 35:03.500
Things I can't explain.

35:04.928 --> 35:09.076
When you put an overactive
mind in an inactive environment,

35:09.176 --> 35:11.822
there's bound to
be complications. Particularly,

35:11.922 --> 35:15.111
- if chemical substances are involved.
- I'm not on drugs.

35:17.311 --> 35:21.625
Well, the easiest way to
maintain a healthy mind

35:21.725 --> 35:24.556
is to make sure it has
plenty of exercise.

35:24.656 --> 35:28.686
Now, look, you can view the next
eight months as a punishment,

35:28.786 --> 35:33.764
or you can see it as...
as an opportunity.

37:55.974 --> 38:00.311
- Jesus Christ! Graeme, what the fuck!
- Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

38:01.911 --> 38:03.542
What do you want?

38:03.757 --> 38:05.393
I'm just wondering if
you're not doing anything,

38:05.493 --> 38:07.452
maybe you wouldn't mind
helping me with this.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.086
Piss off. I'm not your slave.

38:37.082 --> 38:40.717
If you hold this piece,
I can put this piece on top.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.467
Just need to hold it
in place until it sets.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.972
- How long does that take?
- Ten minutes.

39:11.616 --> 39:14.683
Sorry I'm not much
of a conversationalist.

39:15.919 --> 39:17.452
What?

39:17.589 --> 39:19.924
Well, just, we don't really talk.

39:20.424 --> 39:23.367
It's fine. Neither am I.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.930
- If you wanted to...
- I don't though.

39:29.733 --> 39:31.266
No.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.007
It's just...

39:37.007 --> 39:38.777
I suppose what I'm trying to say
is that I don't want you to think

39:38.877 --> 39:41.345
I've got anything
against you or nothin'.

39:42.345 --> 39:45.389
My old man was never
really there, you know.

39:45.549 --> 39:50.088
My mum, she wasn't much better.
I don't know.

39:51.088 --> 39:55.726
I think maybe I was the only reason
they stayed together probably.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.514
And maybe they resented me for
that or something. I don't know.

40:00.765 --> 40:05.865
The thing is, I never
talked openly about things.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.039
And you're the closest thing
to a daughter that I've got.

40:08.139 --> 40:11.209
You don't feel cramped in here?
Look at the state of this fucking room.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.877
- No wonder you've got asthma.
- Angina.

40:12.977 --> 40:16.247
If you cleared some shit out of here,
you could have a half decent work space.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.283
Your mum's a bit funny about
throwing things away.

40:18.383 --> 40:22.120
Yeah 'cause you never know when you're
gonna need a three-quarter scale Jesus.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.590
Besides, if it means that much to her,
why does she keep it in the basement?

40:25.690 --> 40:28.444
Most of this stuff was here
when she bought the place.

40:30.077 --> 40:33.531
- Why didn't they just take it with them?
- Well, they left in a bit of a hurry.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.266
And most of this stuff
was probably donated.

40:36.366 --> 40:39.145
Why would anyone donate
to a bed and breakfast?

40:43.608 --> 40:46.856
Why would anyone donate to
a bed and breakfast, Graeme?

40:48.357 --> 40:51.025
I think you better go
and talk to your mum.

41:48.406 --> 41:51.075
Look, it wasn't even my idea.
It was your father's.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.378
He knew they'd want rid of
the place as quickly as possible,

41:53.478 --> 41:55.146
so he made them a cash offer.

41:55.246 --> 41:58.316
And he had some idea about moving the place
off-site and restoring it somewhere else

41:58.416 --> 42:00.752
and then subdividing the section
off to the neighbors or something.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.922
Look, I don't remember the details exactly,
but the way he explained it to me...

42:04.022 --> 42:05.523
we would've got twice
what we paid for it.

42:05.623 --> 42:08.659
You knew a girl was murdered in my
room and you still let me live in it.

42:08.759 --> 42:11.930
It wasn't an ideal situation, but as I said,
it was only supposed to be short term.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.567
Ideal? She was stabbed 67
times with a meat fork.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.336
Listen, when you start working and
you have to pay bills of your own,

42:18.436 --> 42:21.172
we'll see how quick you are to
snub your nose at a bargain.

42:21.272 --> 42:22.974
I can see why you never
open your mouth, Graeme.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.675
Don't blame him. He thought
you'd already told me.

42:24.775 --> 42:27.578
- Why didn't you?
- Because you were four years old.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.314
And by the time you were old
enough to know the truth,

42:29.414 --> 42:31.215
you never wanted to
speak to me anyway.

42:32.615 --> 42:35.483
Look, I'm sorry, Kylie. Okay?

42:36.186 --> 42:40.356
I guess I just thought... what you
didn't know wouldn't hurt you.

42:44.529 --> 42:47.699
"In what was considered one of New
Zealand's most brutal murders,

42:47.799 --> 42:50.635
Elizabeth Chalmers, or Lizzy as
she was more commonly known,

42:50.735 --> 42:52.937
had been beaten, bitten

42:53.037 --> 42:56.507
and stabbed over 60 times
with a carving fork.

42:56.607 --> 43:00.545
Police claimed to have multiple suspects,
but to date, no arrests have been made.

43:00.645 --> 43:05.017
After alleged reports of assault against
staff and an increase in neighborhood crime,

43:05.117 --> 43:08.652
this was the last in a long line
of unwanted controversies

43:08.752 --> 43:11.189
for the church-owned and
operated halfway house

43:11.289 --> 43:13.792
which was forced to
finally shut its doors

43:13.892 --> 43:17.660
on February 28, 1996."

43:20.231 --> 43:22.500
I may have been a bit hasty
with my initial investigation.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.567
If I had to make a bet, I'd say
this place is crawling with NRE.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.807
- What?
- Negative residual energy.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.396
- It's what happens when a spirit...
- I don't need to know the lingo.

43:32.496 --> 43:34.792
- I just need you to get rid of it.
- Well, it's not that simple.

43:34.892 --> 43:36.764
- Why did you say it was?
- I didn't.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.017
All I said is I could help you
figure out what we're dealing with.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.719
And now we know. A murdered
girl who needs our help.

43:41.819 --> 43:43.554
So what are you suggesting? A séance?

43:43.654 --> 43:46.190
You wanna light some candles, play pass
the parcel with a fucking dead girl?

43:46.290 --> 43:47.692
I don't have time for that.

43:47.792 --> 43:51.393
Kylie, as long as you live in this house,
I'm not sure you have a choice.

43:53.762 --> 43:55.424
The thing about the
justice system, Kylie,

43:55.524 --> 43:57.869
is that they don't really like
to make special allowances.

43:57.969 --> 44:00.805
I'm not asking them to change the sentence.
I'm just asking for a transfer.

44:00.905 --> 44:03.574
And in another three months,
once you've shown some compliance,

44:03.674 --> 44:06.611
- maybe we can ask the judge to reconsider.
- Three months? I could be dead by then.

44:06.711 --> 44:09.113
- What we need is some perspective.
- Would you shut up, Dennis?

44:09.213 --> 44:12.283
I don't need a counseling session.
I just need to get out of this house.

44:12.383 --> 44:16.689
Look, Kylie, unless we can prove
that you're in danger to yourself

44:16.789 --> 44:19.924
or someone else, then you'll to have to
remain here for the time being, okay?

44:20.024 --> 44:23.226
Now, I won't be offended if
you don't eat any of these...

44:40.177 --> 44:41.512
Miriam, with respect,

44:41.612 --> 44:44.848
I'm worried about how these superstitions
might be affecting Kylie's...

44:44.948 --> 44:45.983
Oh, dear.

44:46.083 --> 44:47.719
Oh, no. They've been
doing this all week.

44:47.819 --> 44:50.288
Hold on. I'll go and have
a look at the switchboard.

44:50.388 --> 44:53.591
It's these old houses, you see.
It doesn't take much to overload them.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.661
- Oh, God. What have I done that for?
- Do you need a hand, Miriam?

44:56.761 --> 44:59.097
No, I've gotta try to turn
the light switch on and off.

44:59.197 --> 45:02.030
Forgot that's why I'm out here
in the first place. Hold on.

45:03.865 --> 45:06.772
I'll have to do it by feel 'cause
I can't see what I'm doing.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.541
Right.

45:09.841 --> 45:12.183
- What does that one do?
- No.

45:14.144 --> 45:17.114
- Anything?
- No.

45:19.149 --> 45:20.318
Oh. That was it.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.653
- Was it?
- The one you did before.

45:23.553 --> 45:25.389
What was that?

45:26.157 --> 45:28.624
Jesus Christ!

45:45.475 --> 45:48.012
So from what I understand,

45:48.112 --> 45:51.549
you showed some aggressive
behavior towards Mr. McRandle

45:51.649 --> 45:53.451
in the moments leading
up to the incident,

45:53.551 --> 45:54.986
- is that correct?
- No.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.256
Okay, so you didn't say,
"Shut the fuck up, Dennis.

45:58.356 --> 46:01.692
I don't need a counseling session.
I need to get out of this house."

46:01.792 --> 46:03.528
To which Mr. Hollis replied,

46:03.628 --> 46:07.432
"Unless we can prove that you're a
danger to yourself or someone else,

46:07.532 --> 46:09.133
you will have to
remain in this house."

46:09.233 --> 46:12.003
Now, this was in regards to a request
that you made for a transfer.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.572
Listen, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

46:14.672 --> 46:16.307
I wasn't even in the
room at the time.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.442
- Can you just stand over there, please?
- What?

46:18.542 --> 46:21.344
Can you just stand over there
while we talk to your mum?

46:28.252 --> 46:29.754
Anything you want to tell us, Miriam?

46:29.854 --> 46:34.013
I... I don't think there's
anything else to add.

46:34.113 --> 46:36.060
It's all been a bit much,
to be honest.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.396
So are you happy to
proceed with the story

46:38.496 --> 46:42.431
that Mr. McRandle was
attacked by a vengeful ghost?

46:44.368 --> 46:46.649
- Yes.
- Righto.

46:49.003 --> 46:52.927
Look, I'm not overly familiar with
things of the supernatural nature,

46:53.027 --> 46:55.812
so I don't give any advice on that.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.114
You realize I had to call
the probation office?

47:30.214 --> 47:32.250
- Good.
- Get in the car.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.218
- No.
- I'm not gonna ask again.

47:34.318 --> 47:35.953
Oh, fuck off. What can you do?

47:36.553 --> 47:38.351
When are you gonna stop acting
like a baby and start thinking

47:38.451 --> 47:41.359
- about someone other than yourself?
- What?

47:41.459 --> 47:45.329
If you were stabbed to death and no one
gave a shit, how do you think you'd feel?

47:47.387 --> 47:48.453
Fucked off.

47:48.553 --> 47:50.568
Why do you think it's you she
chose to communicate with?

47:50.668 --> 47:51.804
I don't fuckin' know.

47:51.904 --> 47:54.573
Well, let me give you a hint. You both
feel like the world owes you something.

47:54.673 --> 47:58.309
You're both permanently pissed off.
And you're both stuck up in that house.

47:58.409 --> 48:01.946
Except her sentence doesn't last
eight months. It lasts forever.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.814
Unless someone's
willing to help her out.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.221
It's not gonna change anything.

48:12.207 --> 48:14.324
Maybe she doesn't expect it to.

48:16.702 --> 48:19.253
Maybe she just wants you to listen.

49:03.139 --> 49:04.758
You know what, Lizzy? If you've
got something to say to me,

49:04.858 --> 49:07.043
could you just fucking say it?

50:49.946 --> 50:52.214
Hello, Mortar.

51:45.035 --> 51:46.303
So you think this was Elizabeth's?

51:46.403 --> 51:49.538
How many 15-year-old girls
do you know with dentures?

51:58.982 --> 52:02.820
I've got a theory if you wanna hear it.
I reckon she was a thief.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.656
I reckon she was ripping off the neighbors,
and one of them got wise to it.

52:05.756 --> 52:06.824
- How?
- It doesn't matter how.

52:06.924 --> 52:09.693
The point is he decides to take
matters into his own hands.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.196
He sneaks into her room,
waits for her to come back.

52:12.296 --> 52:15.432
When she opens the vent to hide
her stash, his suspicion pays off.

52:15.832 --> 52:17.001
How's this come into it?

52:17.101 --> 52:19.469
The newspaper article
said she was bitten.

52:19.569 --> 52:21.238
But I don't think that
was part of his plan.

52:21.338 --> 52:22.907
I think he just got caught
up in the frenzy of it,

52:23.007 --> 52:25.643
and he never would have thought
to take out his dental plate first.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.879
So he bites into her neck
like a fuckin' maniac.

52:27.979 --> 52:30.581
His teeth fall down the vent. But there's
nothing he could have done about it.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.877
All he can do is make sure
nobody else ever finds it.

52:33.977 --> 52:36.987
- Why are you making that face?
- I don't know. It seems thin.

52:37.387 --> 52:38.756
What about it seems thin?

52:38.856 --> 52:40.724
For starters, who kills
someone over a brooch?

52:40.824 --> 52:43.661
It's not a brooch, you fuckwit.
It's a Vacheron Constantin.

52:43.761 --> 52:47.231
It's over a hundred years old, and it still
works, which means it's worth a lot of money.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.367
Whoever it belonged to took it's
disappearance pretty personally.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.269
So why did he leave it behind?

52:52.369 --> 52:54.038
I'm sorry, Amos.
Did you have some ideas?

52:54.138 --> 52:56.707
Am I hogging the floor here? Is there
something you'd like to bring to the table?

52:56.807 --> 52:58.375
Don't get shitty.
I'm just being devil's advocate.

52:58.475 --> 53:01.443
No, you're undermining me,
and it's starting to piss me off.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.250
Obviously, he meant
to take it with him.

53:06.350 --> 53:08.552
But after he'd just spent
a fortnight stabbing her,

53:08.652 --> 53:11.354
he probably had to make a quick exit.

53:17.127 --> 53:18.562
His name's Mads Kraglund.

53:18.662 --> 53:20.764
He's been in that house
since before we got here.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.600
Mum's had to call the
council a bunch of times

53:22.700 --> 53:25.436
because of this rancid smell
that wafts over the fence.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.339
Well, he's skinning possums.
That'll be the smell.

53:28.439 --> 53:33.010
You know what else causes
a rancid smell? Dead people.

53:33.410 --> 53:35.746
Mum reckons that when one of the other
neighbors confronted him about it,

53:35.846 --> 53:37.448
Kraglund pulled a gun on him.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.149
Then when the cops
tried to sort it out,

53:39.249 --> 53:41.953
she said they found a fridge
full of aborted fetuses.

53:42.053 --> 53:45.823
Well, you know, your mum's
got a penchant for gossip.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.592
Maybe, but one thing she
doesn't have is an imagination.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.261
She couldn't make up
something like that.

53:52.161 --> 53:55.633
All right, look, I'll set up a
camera on the borderline.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.903
If he gets up to anything out of the
ordinary, we'll know all about it.

53:59.003 --> 54:01.371
Fuck that noise. I say we
break in there tonight.

54:01.471 --> 54:04.408
Kylie, I'm not losing
my job over this.

54:04.508 --> 54:07.710
Not unless I've got a reason to
believe that this guy's a killer.

54:19.757 --> 54:22.693
If that dental plate matches,
this could all be over tomorrow.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.396
- I can't just break into the guy's house.
- Then let me do it.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.164
No. You know that's not possible.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.100
You know, you've got some nerve.
Two days ago I was gonna walk.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.803
You were the one who made me give
a shit. Do you remember that speech?

54:32.903 --> 54:35.273
Look, even if I could convince them
that there was a fault with the modem,

54:35.373 --> 54:37.175
the best I could get you
would be half an hour.

54:37.275 --> 54:40.144
I know this guy's routine.
He doesn't get out of bed before 2:00.

54:40.244 --> 54:44.511
All I need to do is go in and get it while
he's asleep. It'll take me three minutes.

54:45.528 --> 54:47.588
Fuck.

55:10.240 --> 55:13.277
- What are you doing?
- Just in case we need to break a window.

55:13.377 --> 55:15.579
What? You never said anything
about breaking windows.

55:15.679 --> 55:19.047
Well, I don't suppose he's gonna leave
a key under the mat for us, is he?

56:33.256 --> 56:34.725
Hey, you should see this guy's house.

56:34.825 --> 56:36.694
- Did you get the dental plate?
- I think he's got it with him.

56:36.794 --> 56:39.696
Oh! Well, come on. Let's go.

56:39.796 --> 56:41.546
- I might take a look around.
- What?

56:41.646 --> 56:43.812
Well, I'm not gonna leave here empty-handed.
There's got to be something else

56:43.912 --> 56:45.311
- we can pin on him.
- Kylie.

56:45.411 --> 56:48.637
- Just wait there. I'll be two seconds.
- Kylie.

58:33.815 --> 58:36.122
- What's your problem?
- My leg!

58:41.625 --> 58:43.761
- I think I should go back in there.
- What?

58:43.861 --> 58:46.223
I thought he sprung me, but he's
completely whacked off his nut.

58:46.323 --> 58:48.460
I saw the dental plate.
It's in a pile of newspapers...

58:48.560 --> 58:50.995
Do you know what this is? This is
what happens when a shitty idea

58:51.095 --> 58:53.331
blows up in your face. Except it
doesn't blow up in your face, Kylie.

58:53.431 --> 58:57.532
It blows up in mine. Now,
please stop pissing around and help me.

59:20.212 --> 59:21.656
Go.

59:50.553 --> 59:53.177
I need a number
for Bucknell, Bulford.

59:53.278 --> 59:55.623
Yes. Yeah. Lynfield Road.

59:57.291 --> 59:59.526
Fifty fuckin' cents?

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.743
Kylie, it's Amos.
He's coming. He's got a gun.

01:00:07.843 --> 01:00:11.306
- Shit. What do we do?
- I don't know. Get out the house. Hide.

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.701
No.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.047
Just browsing, are ya?

01:05:28.603 --> 01:05:32.262
Give me your home address. Maybe I'll sniff
around your shit, see how you like it.

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.798
- I know what you did.
- In relation to what?

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:38.947
The girl next door,
the one you murdered.

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:43.974
How did you come by that estimation?
From a few old newspapers?

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.544
And this.

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.216
That hole in the door
was a nifty trick.

01:05:54.316 --> 01:05:57.120
Can't say the same about
your powers of deduction.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.022
Before you go around
accusing people of shit,

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.423
you ought to get a handle
on some of the facts.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.791
Would that be something
you'd agree with?

01:06:03.591 --> 01:06:05.226
More or less.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:10.364
Come. I'll show you something.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.030
The brooch belonged to my son Eugene.
When I say he was my son,

01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:19.509
he wasn't my son by blood or
any other legitimate means.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.378
But I knew his mother, Joanie.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:26.149
And when I say I knew her, we had a certain
professional arrangement. You know?

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:30.153
Anyway, she showed up at my
place one day with this young'un.

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:35.324
Skinny as a rake. Huge black eyes.
Shivering half to death.

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:38.394
I didn't know what they were running from,
but I knew that it couldn't be good.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:41.264
I told them they could stay at
my place as long as they needed.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.633
She didn't even last the night.

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:49.172
Now, I'm no Joe Doakes myself,
but this kid was really fucking strange.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:51.674
He never said more than three words,

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:56.413
never looked you in the eye
and never ate off a plate.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:07:00.745
But he had a gift.
He loved mechanical stuff.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.153
Didn't matter whether it was
a motor or a circuit board.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:05.722
He'd figure out a way to make it go.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:09.025
And me being a bloke that had
a lot of stuff that needed fixing,

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.462
I thought, shit,
maybe this could work out.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:16.599
Didn't matter whether it was
a car engine or a toastie oven,

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:20.607
he'd pull it apart and
reassemble it again bit by bit,

01:07:20.707 --> 01:07:24.200
sometimes adding his
own twist. "Eugenized."

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:28.745
That's what I used to call it.
I thought it was pretty funny,

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:31.180
until one day I caught him
tearing the limbs off a moggy

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.881
to see if he could put
'em on backwards.

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.690
I tried to set him straight,
but it wouldn't stick.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:44.227
The next time he strayed, I did the
only thing I felt equipped to do.

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.563
Unfortunately, I was coming off
the back of a three-day bender

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:49.265
and I probably shouldn't
have used a tire chain.

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:53.169
I actually thought I
killed the little bastard.

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.805
Next morning I come back to face
up to my sins and he was gone.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.273
That was the last I ever seen him.

01:07:58.573 --> 01:08:00.384
How long ago was this?

01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:03.645
About a year before that
young lady was killed.

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:09.552
A year's a long time. How do
you know he didn't leave town?

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:12.416
There's something else you
should know about Eugene.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.920
And this makes his disappearance
a little hard to explain.

01:08:18.647 --> 01:08:21.649
He wasn't a fan of open spaces.

01:08:21.751 --> 01:08:23.566
What do you mean?

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:28.002
Ten years he never went outside.
Barely left the house.

01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:31.795
Can I take a look at his room?

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.478
Go for your life.

01:10:11.579 --> 01:10:14.268
Well, hello there.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:21.115
You can record a message by pressing
the green button on my fanny pack.

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:09.334
I can still see you.

01:11:14.592 --> 01:11:18.561
I tried to tell my mum about you.

01:11:18.762 --> 01:11:23.818
I said, "Mum, there's a man
who lives in the walls."

01:11:24.956 --> 01:11:29.650
I would never do that to my friend.

01:11:30.673 --> 01:11:33.914
Not if you tell me your name.

01:11:38.349 --> 01:11:41.636
Not if you tell me your name.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.522
Eugene.

01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:20.354
Jesus! Je...

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.072
Kylie!

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:25.827
Hello? Hello! Officer!

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:33.330
- I thought you were on house arrest.
- Officer, you need to help me, please.

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.965
- Why? What's going on?
- We have to go back to my house.

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:37.594
You just left the house,
and now you wanna go back?

01:15:37.694 --> 01:15:40.070
No, you don't understand.
My mum might be back by now.

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.571
All right, all right. First thing we
need to do is make a statement.

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.606
Now, what exactly
is this in relation to?

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.443
I was vacuuming the house, and then
I put the vacuum back in the cupboard,

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.379
and I saw that there was this
recess and it led to a secret room,

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.448
and there was this guy
in the walls, and he's pale.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.550
He's got black lips and a bung eye,
and he's fucking crazy.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.953
I swear to God, he tried to kill
me and that's why I took off.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.354
- Hold on, hold on.
- And then I couldn't...

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:01.223
You're going too fast here. Okay.

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:04.324
"Put vacuum cleaner...

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:07.650
back in cupboard."

01:16:09.411 --> 01:16:11.971
And the rest is a blur.
What did you say?

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:37.091
Kylie!

01:16:46.075 --> 01:16:49.018
Don't tell me to calm down!
Just listen to what I'm telling you!

01:16:49.118 --> 01:16:52.041
There is a man living in the walls of
my house, and unless you do something,

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:57.512
he's gonna kill my mum!
Just call my house, please! Please.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:05.754
Yeah. Hi. Can you put me
through to Probation Services?

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.156
God.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.724
- Amos.
- Are you okay?

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.826
- This is gonna sound insane.
- I know. There's a guy in the walls.

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.527
She's telling the truth.
We have to get back to her place.

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.897
This is bullshit.

01:18:15.164 --> 01:18:18.761
Look. You see that? That hole leads
to a passageway inside the walls.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.598
This explanis everything. There was
never any ghost or the noises.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:25.254
The power bills,
the stolen food... it was him.

01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:29.896
Not that I'm trying to pick holes,

01:18:29.996 --> 01:18:32.675
but in the 15 years a deranged
killer spends hiding in the attic,

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.643
you'd think he'd want to do
something a little more heinous

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:37.980
- than steal food from the pantry.
- Maybe it was just a bad dream.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.382
It wasn't a dream.
Why can't you just fucking look?

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:43.452
Kylie, we've searched the entire house.
We haven't found anything.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.287
Well, that's not entirely true.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:52.828
Kylie, it's the drugs you haven't
taken that concern me the most.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:53.996
What are you talking about?

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.898
A year ago you were
diagnosed as bipolar.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:58.234
Yeah, to get on the sickness benefit.
Everyone does it.

01:18:58.334 --> 01:18:59.869
Going off your medication
can be very dangerous.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:02.204
Dennis, I think you'll find my
mental state is pretty sound

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.873
compared to the maniac that's
living in our fucking walls!

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:07.076
- Now, just listen for a moment...
- No, you listen. I'm not crazy.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.611
But I will be if you keep
trying to rationalize this.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:12.615
All you need to do is tear down that wall
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:15.551
- Well, we're not going to do that.
- Okay, if you won't then I will.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:17.553
Kylie, sit down.

01:19:19.231 --> 01:19:21.109
Sit down.

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:33.836
I realize how difficult this is for you.
But if you can just imagine for a moment

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:37.335
that the danger you think you're
in may not be as real as it seems.

01:19:39.072 --> 01:19:41.410
Are you familiar with the term
"dissociative identity disorder?"

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:44.480
- Oh, get fucked.
- Just hear him out, Kylie.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.917
- Do you ever lose track of time?
- No, I don't.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.286
- Do you sometimes hear voices?
- This is ridiculous.

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:53.422
- What about your menstruating patterns?
- I beg your pardon?

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.097
A hallmark of the disorder in
women is that each personality

01:19:56.197 --> 01:19:58.845
has its own menstrual cycle.
This would mean that your periods

01:19:58.945 --> 01:20:01.931
- are more frequent than usual.
- Well, that explains a lot.

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:05.201
When an incident occurs that we
don't feel equipped to deal with,

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.503
the mind has the ability to
generate additional personalities.

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:09.371
Yeah, I understand the
mechanics of it, shithead.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.374
I just don't understand how this is any
less retarded than what I'm suggesting.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.630
These hauntings, the blackouts,
the voice on the tape,

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:17.081
- it's all just a coping device.
- To cope with what?

01:20:17.181 --> 01:20:20.783
This. Being back in this house. The thought
of spending the next seven months

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:23.852
in the one place you've spent
your whole life trying to escape.

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:26.261
You've staged an elaborate
hoax to give credence

01:20:26.361 --> 01:20:27.923
to a delusion which is
starting to fall apart.

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:31.325
If it's a delusion, how come I'm
not the only one that saw him?

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.731
Tell him.

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:40.167
It was years ago, Kylie.
I don't know what I saw.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.686
Get off me!

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.364
Can I make a suggestion?

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:12.735
I think perhaps it's time we
transferred Kylie to the clinic.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:16.238
She'd be under 24-hour supervision.
We'd have a much better chance

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.124
of knowing if she stops
taking her medication.

01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:23.418
Perhaps that would be for the best.

01:21:24.174 --> 01:21:29.662
We have to try and present this in a way
that she... feels like it's her decision.

01:21:30.951 --> 01:21:34.281
All right, I'll leave
Grayson here with you...

01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:36.923
in case she relapses.

01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:49.427
Lovely.

01:21:51.445 --> 01:21:54.743
Well, if there's anything to be
learned from the situation, Kylie,

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.379
you need to be around
people your own age.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:02.104
Oh! Oh! Oh, excuse me.

01:22:02.405 --> 01:22:04.753
And don't forget,
within a few months,

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:07.689
we can look at applying
for approved absences.

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:10.692
You won't feel quite so shut
out from the outside world.

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:15.140
Of course friends and family can
come and visit any time as well.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.800
The facilities themselves,
they really are top-notch.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.636
The place is fully equipped with
a rumpus room, badminton court.

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:22.871
There's even a Flying Fox.
It's dreadfully good fun.

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:28.909
But the whole purpose of Tiaki Wairua...
is to promote a sense of independence.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:33.280
So, what do you think?
Would it be okay?

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:42.758
- Yeah, I think it sounds great.
- Wonderful.

01:22:43.513 --> 01:22:45.377
Mum, can I talk to you
in private for a sec?

01:22:45.477 --> 01:22:47.377
What about?

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.233
Women's stuff.

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:02.511
The only person Eugene ever tried to harm
was Dennis. Why do you think that is?

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:05.147
- I beg your pardon?
- Mum, he has a dental plate.

01:23:05.247 --> 01:23:07.115
Well, lots of people
have dental plates.

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:09.051
What if he was a counselor
at Sunshine Grove?

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:11.393
If Eugene was hiding in the
walls when Lizzy was killed,

01:23:11.493 --> 01:23:14.205
he would've seen him do it.
Do you see what this means?

01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:16.525
He wasn't trying to scare us.
He was trying to warn us.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.194
Kylie, we've been
through this before.

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:20.629
- It's all in your head.
- That's what he wants us to think.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.999
So you're basing all this on the fact
that he's got one of his teeth missing?

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:26.368
I can prove it. I just need
you to keep him in that room

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.470
within eyeshot of the
cop until I get back.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.005
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Just do what you do best.

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:42.363
- Miriam, do you mind if I...
- So you live out at Shepherd Heights,

01:23:42.463 --> 01:23:45.387
- do you, Dennis?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:46.855
Well, it's nice up there.

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.625
Graeme and I sometimes go to
Sammy's on a Wednesday night

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:52.319
for the all-you-can-eat buffet.
It's good value, isn't it?

01:23:52.419 --> 01:23:55.697
- You must go there all the time, do you?
- No, not... not really.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:58.634
No, no. No, you wouldn't.
That's the thing about buffets.

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:01.337
It's all the young kids. Sure, it's a
great place to throw birthday parties,

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:05.372
but I wouldn't want your six-year-old's
fist in my crème brûlée, thanks very much.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.436
I said, "Go-Ann, how many
sick days have you got left?"

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.472
She said, "I don't know. What is
sick day?" This is what she said.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.273
She's a wee Chinese girl.
You know what they're like.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.475
I said, "Your husband's lost
the use of both his legs.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:43.211
You're entitled to a bloody
sick day." "Oh, I'm not sure."

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:45.948
- Poor thing. She didn't understand.
- Miriam, look, I'm sorry. I...

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:48.183
Maybe it's a cultural thing. I don't know.
But they're good wee workers.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:50.350
Miriam!

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:58.458
I need to use the bathroom, please.

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:30.659
- What are you doing? Where is he?
- He said he had to go to the toilet.

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:32.327
I told you not to let
him out of your sight.

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:35.230
Well, if a man's got to go,
he's got to go, doesn't he?

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:38.432
There's not anything I
can do about it, is there?

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.474
Where's the cop?

01:25:47.382 --> 01:25:50.044
I guess he had to go as well.

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.889
Officer Grayson?

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.238
Now, hang on a minute, Kylie.
Shouldn't we discuss this first?

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.073
You can't accuse somebody
of murder over a cup of tea

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.375
and a biscuit, Mum.
It doesn't work like that.

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:23.974
But do you really think waving a knife
around is gonna do us any favors?

01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:27.137
I don't know.
Let's see how it plays out.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:10.639
- Looking for something?
- I was just using the bathroom.

01:27:11.506 --> 01:27:13.989
What's wrong with the one downstairs?

01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:16.619
I was hoping to be discreet.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.000
How did you know we
had a bathroom up here?

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:20.639
What's all this about?

01:27:20.739 --> 01:27:22.171
We were just wondering if
maybe you worked here.

01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:25.107
- Could you let me ask the questions?
- Well, you're taking long enough.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:29.444
A year before Elizabeth Chalmers was
killed you came here on work experience.

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:32.947
First day on the job you get the shit
kicked out of you by a 15-year-old girl.

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:37.976
That can't have been fun. Worst part
is you didn't even get paid for it.

01:27:39.719 --> 01:27:41.888
Miriam, I think your
daughter's a little confused.

01:27:41.988 --> 01:27:46.827
No. No. I'm the one that's confused.
But I'm starting to get my head around it.

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:22.046
Jesus, Kylie, he's got a
bloody corkscrew in his neck.

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:32.692
What are you doing?

01:29:32.792 --> 01:29:35.370
Unless you can find anything else
we can use to defend ourselves,

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:39.139
I'm afraid this is all we've got. Now,
would you please come give me a hand?

01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:02.063
- Have you got any scissors?
- What for?

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:05.298
If I can break the strap,
it'll send out a tamper signal.

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.807
Well... Oh, yeah, okay.

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.120
Go! Go! Go!

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:42.938
Move your fat ass!

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:46.106
I can't help it, Kylie.
I'm bottom heavy, all right?

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.018
Amos. Thank God.

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:06.001
I got a tamper signal.
What happened to your face?

01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:10.325
It seems I've made a terrible mistake.
She was telling the truth. It was Eugene.

01:32:10.425 --> 01:32:13.928
He's killed Officer Grayson and
he's taken Kylie and Miriam,

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:19.000
and I-I can't find them anywhere.
Oh, God, I'm such a fool.

01:32:25.926 --> 01:32:28.877
- What's that?
- It'll pick up Kylie's signal.

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:31.945
Here, you call the police.

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:42.422
Amos!

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:50.104
Amos, it's Dennis!

01:32:51.039 --> 01:32:52.833
Did you hear that?

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:11.450
I need something to
wedge this open with.

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.892
Nah, it's too thin.

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:20.226
Give me something heavy.

01:34:27.684 --> 01:34:29.187
Fuck.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.097
What do you say?

01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:13.207
- What?
- Be nice to the man. Say thank you.

01:35:13.907 --> 01:35:18.078
- Whose do you think this is?
- I only take the little things.

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.782
But I always give 'em back.

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:38.232
You're okay, sweetheart?

01:35:39.401 --> 01:35:41.668
- Do you need some help?
- I'm fine.

01:35:42.554 --> 01:35:46.184
You're as pale as a sheet.
You should drink some water.

01:35:46.385 --> 01:35:50.143
- What? What is it?
- I don't know, but it's not fucking water.

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:59.386
Is this funny, is it, mate?

01:36:01.486 --> 01:36:03.472
You seem to find this whole
situation quite amusing.

01:36:03.572 --> 01:36:05.192
Kylie, don't.

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:09.864
Two people are dead. My leg's
been split open like a fucking bagel,

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:13.400
and this bottom-feeding little
pissant thinks it's hysterical.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.492
He saw what happened to Elizabeth.

01:36:15.592 --> 01:36:17.579
You never tried to stop it.
You never called for help.

01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:19.874
- You just sat there and watched.
- He doesn't mean us any harm.

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:22.177
That doesn't change the fact
that he's a gutless maggot.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:23.147
- Kylie!
- What?

01:36:23.247 --> 01:36:25.980
You're always antagonizing people.
Just stop it.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.450
I'm antagonizing? We wouldn't even
be in this shit if it wasn't for him.

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:30.952
- You can't blame him.
- Why not?

01:36:31.052 --> 01:36:33.420
'Cause he's not right
in the head obviously.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.323
It's not gonna do us
any good to upset him.

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:39.092
Oh, am I upsetting you, Eugene?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.950
This me?

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:15.962
- It's good.
- I've got other ones.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.202
That's you in the bathtub.

01:37:22.605 --> 01:37:24.627
Is there gonna be more
of these pictures?

01:37:24.727 --> 01:37:26.207
No.

01:37:28.419 --> 01:37:31.551
That's you on the
first day of school.

01:37:32.662 --> 01:37:35.630
That's you when you got expelled.

01:37:37.044 --> 01:37:40.785
That's you stealing Amarula
from the liquor cabinet.

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:45.493
That's you being sick from
drinking too much Amarula.

01:37:47.358 --> 01:37:51.669
That's you punching your mum in
the face after she told you off.

01:37:52.378 --> 01:37:55.388
That's you not feeling
very good about it.

01:37:56.463 --> 01:38:00.071
That's you the day you went away.

01:38:01.397 --> 01:38:05.349
And that's us waiting
for you to come back.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:20.294
Who's this one?

01:38:21.599 --> 01:38:23.532
Is this Lizzy?

01:38:29.086 --> 01:38:31.478
Why didn't you tell somebody?

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:38.411
I thought they'd take me away.

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:44.216
I thought they'd think I did it.

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:51.992
I was only small, Kylie.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.582
I was only a kid.

01:39:03.471 --> 01:39:06.360
You have to help us, Eugene. Please.

01:39:07.757 --> 01:39:09.975
I know a place we can hide.

01:39:22.819 --> 01:39:24.531
Eugene...

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:41.076
Now, see, this is a perfect example

01:39:41.176 --> 01:39:44.445
of what happens when we don't
discuss our problems openly.

01:39:44.630 --> 01:39:47.877
Is this how you work through
your problems, Dennis?

01:39:49.247 --> 01:39:52.097
I don't need you to tell
me what I did was wrong.

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:54.887
And I'm not trying to make excuses.

01:39:56.917 --> 01:39:59.747
But anyone who says there's
no such thing as a bad egg...

01:39:59.847 --> 01:40:02.747
obviously hasn't worked
in social services.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.701
All I ever wanted to
do was help people.

01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:09.603
But you've got no idea what it's
like to try and help someone...

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:12.104
when all they want to do is
throw it back in your face.

01:41:24.553 --> 01:41:26.261
Fuckin' hell.

01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:05.953
What shall I say? There's been
a murder? Attempted murder?

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:09.219
- Look, do you want to talk to them?
- Why don't you just say...

01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:13.644
Just say something's come up and
you'll have to phone them back.

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:48.924
All right, there she is,
looking very excited.

01:43:49.406 --> 01:43:51.735
And here's Amos with the special...

01:43:51.835 --> 01:43:55.129
Oh. Is that all you do? You just
cut it off with a pair of scissors?

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.031
- Yep.
- Oh. And then what do you do with it?

01:43:57.131 --> 01:44:01.234
Just chuck it in the rubbish.
Or we can keep it as a souvenir.

01:44:01.634 --> 01:44:03.856
- Did you hear that, Graeme?
- Eh?

01:44:03.956 --> 01:44:08.054
Amos was just saying to Kylie...
Oh, don't worry.

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:11.345
- Okay, here we go.
- Oh, hold on.

01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:13.843
Why has it done that?

01:44:13.943 --> 01:44:16.050
- What?
- It's just turned itself off.

01:44:16.150 --> 01:44:18.185
It can't just turn off by itself.
You must've press something.

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:20.988
- No, I didn't. I didn't press anything.
- Is the battery flat?

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:24.445
Well, it shouldn't be.
It's been on the charger all night.

01:44:25.373 --> 01:44:26.620
Eugene!
