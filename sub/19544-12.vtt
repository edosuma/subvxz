00:08.384 --> 00:12.002
As the Dragon Team celebrates Trunks' victory

00:12.221 --> 00:17.966
in the junior division,
two mysterious men appear before them.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.642
W-Who was that, Goku?

00:21.897 --> 00:23.433
I don't know.

00:25.192 --> 00:31.483
But I'm bettin' we won't be the
only ones who get easy wins now.

00:32.491 --> 00:37.656
And so, the Tenkaichi Budokai drawing began.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.415
"(11) Son Goku (12) Vegeta"

00:40.708 --> 00:42.198
Vegeta, huh?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

02:10.964 --> 02:16.709
"What Happened, Piccolo?!
An Unexpected Outcome in the First Round."

02:19.264 --> 02:23.132
Hey, our pops are going to fight each other!
Which one will win?

02:23.352 --> 02:25.343
My father will win. I'm sure of it.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.099
You dummy! Obviously, it will be my papa!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.397
Your old man is dead, isn't he?

02:30.609 --> 02:31.644
Yeah, but dead or not,

02:31.860 --> 02:35.148
Big Brother said that he's been
training in the Next World.

02:35.364 --> 02:39.903
Mighty Mask-san! Mighty Mask-san!
I've been calling you!

02:40.118 --> 02:42.279
Oh, sorry!

02:43.789 --> 02:45.370
Please, hurry up and draw.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.573
Right!

02:47.793 --> 02:49.158
Number 13!

02:49.378 --> 02:53.212
Has Mighty Mask always had such a long torso?

02:54.216 --> 02:57.959
No fair, Trunks-kun! Give me some, too!

02:58.178 --> 03:01.636
I can't. It would give us away,
you know. After the match--

03:01.849 --> 03:03.760
But I can't stand how hot it is in here!

03:03.976 --> 03:08.720
Watch it! Don't let go of me!
Here, I'll give you some!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.777
Ah, that was good!

03:17.781 --> 03:19.487
Contestant Ma Junior!

03:24.204 --> 03:25.705
Number 4.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.779
"(3) Shin"

03:28.625 --> 03:30.240
Against that guy?

03:30.460 --> 03:34.203
Fine. Maybe I'll find out more about who he is.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.665
And next up is the champion,
Mister Satan's turn,

03:37.885 --> 03:41.753
but at his request, I will draw
his number in his place.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.308
Mister Satan will be number 10.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.012
Hey! Your opponent is
going to be Mister Satan!

03:51.231 --> 03:53.222
Who's Mister Satan?

03:53.442 --> 03:57.355
This is not your lucky day,
having to face Papa right off.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.939
And finally, Contestant Yamu.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.660
Yes, it is the remaining number 15, of course.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.865
Okay, here are the results of the drawing!

04:11.877 --> 04:15.415
The first match will be Contestant Kuririn
versus Contestant Punter!

04:15.631 --> 04:17.041
The second match will be Contestant Shin

04:17.257 --> 04:19.122
versus Contestant Ma Junior!

04:19.343 --> 04:23.131
The third match will be Contestant Videl
versus Contestant Spopovitch!

04:23.347 --> 04:25.053
The fourth match will be Contestant Kibito

04:25.265 --> 04:27.301
versus Contestant Great Saiyaman!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.382
The fifth match will be Contestant No. 18

04:29.603 --> 04:31.309
versus Contestant Mister Satan!

04:31.521 --> 04:35.139
The sixth match will be Contestant Son Goku
versus Contestant Vegeta!

04:35.359 --> 04:37.395
The seventh match will be
Contestant Mighty Mask

04:37.611 --> 04:38.726
versus Contestant Killa!

04:38.946 --> 04:40.607
The eighth match will be Contestant Yamu

04:40.822 --> 04:42.323
versus Contestant Jewel!

04:42.532 --> 04:44.193
The matches will begin right away.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.900
All right, I will now show you
to the contestants' lobby.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.862
You all know the rules, right?

04:50.082 --> 04:52.915
If you give up, go down for a ten-count,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.333
fall off of the competition platform,
called the ring,

04:55.545 --> 04:58.912
or happen to kill your opponent,
it will constitute a loss.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.669
Also, owing to the many matches
that we will be holding,

05:01.885 --> 05:04.672
there will be a time limit
of 30 minutes per match.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.799
If the match has not been
determined after 30 minutes,

05:07.015 --> 05:10.553
it will be awarded by the judges' ruling.

05:10.769 --> 05:14.227
Huh, there's a time limit.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.895
All I'm going to need for you is 10 seconds!

05:19.111 --> 05:21.397
All right, all right.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.322
Hmm, the fifth match, huh?
So, who's my opponent?

05:25.534 --> 05:29.493
I don't know any details, but she is
a somewhat attractive woman.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.882
Piccolo-san...

05:45.095 --> 05:49.384
Hey, Gohan-kun, that man has
been like that for a while now.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.681
He seems unusually nervous, doesn't he?

05:51.893 --> 05:56.387
That's not true. He's just
boosting his Ki by doing that.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.687
Piccolo-san...

06:00.902 --> 06:05.362
Why are you so nervous?
Is your next opponent really that ominous?

06:16.752 --> 06:19.539
You're pretty fired up, aren't you, Goku?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.378
| just can't seem to wait!

06:22.591 --> 06:24.752
You're up against Vegeta
in the first round, and all.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.755
It'll be like the
championship match right there!

06:27.971 --> 06:30.587
Yeah! I'm all excited for it right now!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.477
Piccolo...

06:38.690 --> 06:42.228
Yeah, he's pretty fired up, too.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.184
Geez, it looks like I'll be up against you

06:44.404 --> 06:47.567
in the second round, Piccolo.
Go easy on me, will you?

06:47.783 --> 06:49.364
Right, Goku?

06:53.663 --> 06:57.155
And you... Your opponent is supposed
to be the world champion,

06:57.375 --> 06:59.411
so allow him to save some face, accordingly.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.711
Oh, hush. I know.

07:23.777 --> 07:28.942
Okay, everyone! Thank you
so much for waiting this long!

07:30.575 --> 07:32.782
Good luck!

07:34.538 --> 07:38.747
Videl! Stick it to 'em!

08:04.359 --> 08:08.398
It has been too long, huh?
Okay, now to cut loose a little!

08:08.613 --> 08:15.234
And now, we're about to start the
matches for the Tenkaichi Budokai!

08:23.503 --> 08:25.835
Videl is in the third match, huh?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.754
Even I'm starting to get excited about this.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.377
Nothing to worry about.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.052
About the only one who could
beat Videl is Mister Satan himself.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.424
I guess you're right.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.847
Oh? Great Saiyaman is here!

08:39.059 --> 08:41.142
Wow, so that means a battle

08:41.354 --> 08:44.061
between the champions of justice
in the second round, huh?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.105
That should be good!

08:46.318 --> 08:51.187
Ha! I wouldn't be too sure about
that dork winning his first round.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.486
Okay, cheer loud, now!

08:52.699 --> 08:54.655
We, the members of the
Satan City Police Department

08:54.868 --> 08:56.608
will be rooting for Videl-san as hard as we can!

08:56.828 --> 08:58.910
Yeah!

08:59.122 --> 09:01.158
--Here.
--What's come over you, Bulma?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.239
You're enjoying yourself
more than usual, aren't you?

09:03.460 --> 09:06.998
Well, Trunks won the junior division, after all.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.081
I knew he was a shoo-in and all,
but I can't help but be happy.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.336
And Vegeta will win the adult division, too.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.294
Father and son will dominate
at this Tenkaichi Budokai.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.968
That's not goin' to happen.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.427
Not when he's facin' my Goku-sa.
Far from winnin' it all,

09:23.647 --> 09:25.353
Vegeta is goin' to lose in the first round.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.056
Oh, you don't know that!

09:28.276 --> 09:31.860
I mean, Trunks did beat Goten-kun, after all.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.690
Goku-sa is goin' to win for absolute sure!

09:35.909 --> 09:37.900
Sure as the sun don't come up in the west,

09:38.119 --> 09:40.110
Goku-sa is not ever goin' to lose.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.538
I'm sorry, but Vegeta, you see,
has been training for five years

09:43.750 --> 09:46.833
using a new model super-gravity
device that I made for him.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.161
This time, Vegeta is sure to win!

09:49.381 --> 09:53.920
Our whole family's livelihood
depends on Goku-sa winnin'!

09:54.135 --> 09:55.796
That's a far cry from a certain somebody

09:56.012 --> 09:57.718
who is only fightin' for the fun of it.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.922
--Vegeta's going to win!
--Goku-sa!

10:00.141 --> 10:02.678
--Vegeta!
--Goku-sa!

10:05.021 --> 10:09.856
Hey, now, cut it out, both of you.
You're being childish.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.433
Shut up!

10:11.653 --> 10:13.234
What are you doing?!

10:13.446 --> 10:17.860
And now, the wait is over! Who among
this group will come out on top?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.362
Let's start it off right now with the first match!

10:20.578 --> 10:24.821
First up is Contestant Kuririn
versus Contestant Punter!

10:25.041 --> 10:26.656
Good luck, Kuririn!

10:26.876 --> 10:28.832
Well, here goes nothing.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.954
Whoopsie...

10:34.467 --> 10:36.082
What's your deal?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.466
Oh, were you standing there?

10:39.681 --> 10:43.014
I thought you might have run away.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.553
You're an unlucky one,
running into me right off the bat.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.558
But don't be too worried.

10:49.774 --> 10:54.143
With a little luck, you'll get off
with just a trip to the hospital.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.273
And so, both contestants
make their way forward!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.866
Contestant Kuririn has had
some excellent showings

10:59.075 --> 11:00.986
in this tournament in his younger years,

11:01.202 --> 11:04.160
and this appearance marks
his return after a long absence.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.079
Contestant Punter, whom he will be facing,
is known for his ferocity,

11:07.292 --> 11:09.032
and made it to the semifinals
at the last tournament,

11:09.252 --> 11:11.208
falling just short with a ringout defeat,

11:11.421 --> 11:15.835
but of course, he has come to the
tournament this time to win it all!

11:25.143 --> 11:30.604
The man who is fighting Dad looks
big and strong. I hope he's okay.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.023
No problem, no problem.
That guy is no big deal at all.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.271
Your dad is the strongest man in the world.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.273
ReaHy?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.821
Yeah, really.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.898
At least among earthlings.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.450
What is this? Look at the
size difference between them!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.368
This is going to be no contest!

11:46.581 --> 11:48.913
| feel sorry for Contestant Kuririn.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.333
Once Punter gets a fire lit under
that brutal fighting zeal of his,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.410
he doesn't show any mercy.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.908
Uh-oh! Despite so much difference
in their sizes, Contestant Punter

12:29.124 --> 12:32.491
does not give any hint of holding back!
He means to fight!

12:32.710 --> 12:36.623
And so, how will Contestant Kuririn
face off against him?

12:37.882 --> 12:41.374
Of course I am! I'm going to show you
that the Tenkaichi Budokai

12:41.594 --> 12:47.180
is serious business! It's no place
for a runty old bozo like you!

12:47.392 --> 12:48.222
Good grief.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.802
This is no time to be wasting
energy on a jackass like him.

13:03.658 --> 13:07.776
All right, please begin the match!

13:23.094 --> 13:27.007
As you can see, I may be big,
but I'm also fast and nimble!

13:27.223 --> 13:28.508
Do you read me?

13:28.725 --> 13:31.888
It won't do you any good to
scamper around away from me!

13:32.103 --> 13:36.187
Ugh, I get it, | get it. I won't run, I won't run.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.899
It's too soon for you to be freaked out!

13:41.112 --> 13:46.607
Now I'm gonna show you how tough lam!
Go ahead and punch me!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.363
Well, how about it? Don't be shy!

13:49.579 --> 13:50.659
Go on! Go on!

13:50.872 --> 13:51.736
Go on!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.457
Okay.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.081
I'll take you up on your kind offer!

14:11.184 --> 14:12.845
Okay, ringout!

14:13.061 --> 14:17.225
Contestant Punter is out of the ring!
Contestant Kuririn wins!

14:17.440 --> 14:18.771
Whoa, awesome!

14:18.983 --> 14:19.813
What just happened?!

14:20.026 --> 14:22.142
He's got amazing power for his size!

14:22.362 --> 14:23.772
He did it, he did it!

14:23.988 --> 14:26.149
My dad is strong!

14:26.366 --> 14:27.355
You see?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.952
Terrific! I should have known, all right!

14:30.161 --> 14:30.991
I've been waiting for this!

14:31.204 --> 14:33.946
This is how the Tenkaichi Budokai ought to be!

14:34.165 --> 14:36.372
You did it, Kuririn.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.290
That was a piece of cake.

14:38.503 --> 14:42.087
Piccolo, it's your turn next. Good luck.

14:45.176 --> 14:48.043
Hey, now, what are you so tense about?

14:48.263 --> 14:51.005
This isn't the kind of match you
should be stressing over, right?

14:52.016 --> 14:54.052
W-What is it, guys?

14:57.772 --> 15:00.514
Moving on, it's the second match!
This will be a contest

15:00.733 --> 15:03.145
between Contestant Shin
and Contestant Ma Junior!

15:03.361 --> 15:06.103
All right, here come both contestants!

15:17.417 --> 15:22.161
| see. This does appear to be an
enjoyable tournament, doesn't it?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.131
All right, both contestants, please come ahead!

15:27.343 --> 15:30.426
This will be Contestant Shin's first appearance.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.094
Contestant Ma Junior, whom he faces,

15:32.307 --> 15:34.923
gave us quite an incredible battle
in the championship match

15:35.143 --> 15:40.763
at the tournament a long time ago,
one that I remember quite well!

15:40.982 --> 15:44.474
U-Um... please don't destroy
the grounds this time, okay?

15:44.694 --> 15:48.232
Hey, that's one of those guys
that got in the way

15:48.448 --> 15:50.279
when Mister Satan was fighting Cell, isn't it?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.948
Yeah, no doubt about it. I saw him on TV!

16:00.752 --> 16:01.787
What's the matter?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.995
Is this Shin guy really all that nerve-wracking?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.249
Yeah, kind of.

16:06.466 --> 16:11.301
Are you sure? He doesn't
really look all that formidable.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.474
At last, we'll find out just how
much battle power this guy has,

16:21.689 --> 16:23.896
when we don't have the first clue.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.898
Okay, now then, the second match!
Please begin!

16:36.412 --> 16:38.494
|-| can't summon my strength!

16:49.008 --> 16:52.626
W-Why is this? For some reason,
it's hard to fight this guy.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.382
A-And I've never even seen him before, either.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.891
What's going on?! Why aren't you fighting?!

17:08.111 --> 17:09.896
What's the holdup?!

17:14.951 --> 17:18.535
W-What is the matter? Go on, please, begin!

17:18.746 --> 17:20.656
Stop screwing around! Get to it!

17:20.873 --> 17:25.367
We came here to see a match!
We're not here to see a staring contest!

17:26.378 --> 17:30.839
Okay, the match has started!
P-Please hurry up and begin!

17:45.940 --> 17:48.101
l-lmpossible!

17:49.527 --> 17:51.768
Just what is the matter, Piccolo-san?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.478
Why, that...!

18:01.289 --> 18:03.621
Who exactly is this guy?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.079
You will learn, soon enough.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.465
You will learn, soon enough.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.219
But right now, let's enjoy this game.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.645
Piccolo!

18:31.861 --> 18:34.352
|-|s something the matter?

18:34.572 --> 18:36.437
l-l'm sorry...

18:41.537 --> 18:43.869
l'm dropping out.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.116
Dropping out?

18:45.333 --> 18:48.700
U-Um, by dropping out,
you mean you aren't fighting?

18:48.920 --> 18:50.660
That's right.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.418
That's right. He used to be
Kami over this world.

18:54.634 --> 18:59.674
He may be beginning to get
an inkling as to who I am.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.050
Contestant Ma Junior has dropped out,

19:02.266 --> 19:05.804
so Contestant Shin wins by default!

19:08.523 --> 19:13.062
W-What was that?
What's going on? Did he take ill?

19:13.277 --> 19:16.019
I'll bet that's it. His face does look pale, huh?

19:16.239 --> 19:18.480
--Piccolo-san...
--Hey, Piccolo!

19:18.699 --> 19:20.610
Is it that serious, Piccolo?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.489
Yeah. He's in an entirely different sphere.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.580
Y-You're kidding, right? Stop kidding around!

19:27.792 --> 19:31.831
Come on, l have to fight him next!

19:35.758 --> 19:37.840
A-All right, let's move right along!

19:38.052 --> 19:40.213
Next will be the third match!

19:40.429 --> 19:43.512
Contestant Videl versus
Contestant Spopovitch!

19:46.394 --> 19:48.806
Videl! Videl!

19:49.021 --> 19:53.606
Videl! Videl! Videl!

19:53.818 --> 19:58.187
You're amazingly popular, huh?
Good luck, Videl-san.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.896
Mm-hmm.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.490
Hey, Spopovitch, it's your turn.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.702
Hey, are you listening, Spopovi--

20:23.556 --> 20:25.046
It's time.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.025
Gohan-kun...

20:35.234 --> 20:37.395
I'll see you in the second round.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.322
Mm-hmm.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.699
Contestant Videl, as you are all aware,
is Mister Satan's daughter,

20:45.912 --> 20:48.403
who also works with the police,
and is a champion ofjustice

20:48.623 --> 20:50.659
who has taught many a criminal a lesson!

20:50.875 --> 20:53.958
She also boasts a previous
championship in the junior division

20:54.170 --> 20:57.378
as a little girl, at the tournament
that was held seven years ago.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.376
Facing her is Contestant Spopovitch,

20:59.592 --> 21:01.503
who was beaten in the first round
at the last tournament,

21:01.719 --> 21:05.382
but following a makeover,
is back to make another bid!

21:16.943 --> 21:19.309
With the ultra-popular Videl's arrival,

21:19.528 --> 21:22.861
the Tenkaichi Budokai reaches a fever pitch.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.783
But who exactly is this
mysterious warrior, Shin,

21:26.994 --> 21:29.781
against whom even Piccolo
found himself powerless?

21:29.997 --> 21:32.989
And what is the meaning of his gaze?

22:41.944 --> 22:43.354
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.571 --> 22:45.607
It looks like Videl fights pretty well,

22:45.823 --> 22:48.906
but something ain't right
about that Spopovitch guy.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.655
Hyah! Ha!

22:51.871 --> 22:56.240
You sure are persistent, huh?
I can't afford to lose this now!

22:56.459 --> 22:58.040
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.252 --> 23:01.494
"An Eerie Entity--Who Exactly is Spopovitch...?"

23:01.714 --> 23:03.045
I've got a bad feeling about this.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.498
If I don't do something, Videl will be in danger!

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
