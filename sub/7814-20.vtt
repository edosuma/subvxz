11:55.917 --> 11:56.959
Uh, sort of.

11:56.959 --> 11:58.792
They don’t make those anymore.

11:58.792 --> 11:59.792
I know,

11:59.792 --> 12:01.834
but there is one box left

12:01.834 --> 12:03.375
in deep freeze.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.291
Party saved.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.959
[cell phone rings]

12:06.959 --> 12:08.458
Hello.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.792
[gasps]

12:09.792 --> 12:11.125
The truck broke down.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.375
No Cowboy Kelly bars!

12:13.375 --> 12:15.834
Party unsaved.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.417
I guess that’s my cue.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.041
Time to save the party.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.291
I don’t know, Kick.

12:20.291 --> 12:23.083
Remember last time you tried
to save the party?

12:25.041 --> 12:27.000
Not this time, Gunther.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.792
We’re hoping to find
that truck,

12:28.792 --> 12:30.625
get those Cowboy Kelly bars,

12:30.625 --> 12:32.667
and save Dad’s birthday party.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.709
[Brad]
In your dreams, dill weed.

12:34.709 --> 12:39.166
This time the Brad saves
Dad’s birthday party.

12:39.166 --> 12:42.166
Mom? Can I borrow
a couple bucks?

12:42.166 --> 12:43.667
[sniffing]

12:45.291 --> 12:47.083
Ice cream that-away.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.625
No. My ice-cream sense
has never failed me.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.250
No, no, no, no--

12:54.625 --> 12:56.333
[coughs]

12:56.333 --> 12:58.375
Thank tarnation,
you found me.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.542
Well, just having
a little engine trouble.

13:01.542 --> 13:04.000
I think the proper term
is automotive American.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.709
What about
the Cowboy Kelly bars?

13:07.041 --> 13:09.083
They’re nice and cold for now,

13:09.083 --> 13:12.500
but these puppies don’t have
much time in that freezer.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.041
I think the proper term
is Arctic American.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.542
Kick, how are we
going to get this truck

13:16.542 --> 13:18.125
back to your house
in time?

13:19.375 --> 13:21.208
Yee-hah!

13:21.208 --> 13:25.083
This here’s like
an old-fashioned cattle drive.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.917
Hyah, doggies.
Hyah.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.041
[Gunther]
Canine American.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.375
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I hear ice cream.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.834
No. Cowboy Kelly bars.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.166
Mount up.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.083
Bring it on.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.250
Let’s do this.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.709
You know, I’m really not
feeling it today.

13:49.709 --> 13:50.709
[growls]

13:50.709 --> 13:52.959
I mean, move ’em out!

13:52.959 --> 13:55.333
Looks like smooth sailing
from here on--
[bike riders yelping]

13:55.333 --> 13:56.417
Uh-oh.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.792
It’s the
Third Street Bandits.

14:00.792 --> 14:02.125
The what?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.166
Only the most feared band
of misfits

14:04.166 --> 14:05.875
west of Fourth Street,

14:05.875 --> 14:07.667
and they sound hungry.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.250
Sorry, boys.
You’re on your own.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.625
Oh, how thoughtful.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.583
All this delicious ice cream

14:16.583 --> 14:19.542
delivered directly to us.

14:19.542 --> 14:22.125
Step aside.
This ice cream is spoken for.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.709
Yeah, by me,

14:23.709 --> 14:25.542
and the more
you try to stop us,

14:25.542 --> 14:27.458
the more pain
we’re going to inflict

14:27.458 --> 14:29.834
on your puny, little helmet.

14:32.041 --> 14:34.083
Come on. We’ll take
the old dirt road.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.834
Giddyap! Ha!
[whip cracks]

14:37.834 --> 14:39.583
[grumbles]
Sorry.

14:45.959 --> 14:48.792
Look! After them!

14:51.166 --> 14:52.792
[Chief Bandit]
Ahem.
Oh.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.917
Gotta save Dad’s party.
Gotta save Dad’s party.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.166
Gotta-- Ooh.

15:07.792 --> 15:11.542
Hello, good-looking.

15:12.709 --> 15:13.917

15:15.792 --> 15:18.166
Nonstick cooking spray?

15:18.166 --> 15:19.917
Eh, I’m cookin’.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.083
I think we lost them, Kick.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.500
Yee-ha-ha-ha!

15:28.500 --> 15:30.166
I think they found us,
Kick.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.333
Mellowbrook Bridge?

15:31.333 --> 15:33.500
We’re half way home,
by gum.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.750

<i>Look out for a bizarre</i>

15:35.750 --> 15:37.041

<i>to "steer" clear.</i>

15:39.458 --> 15:41.583
Boo.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.750
Brake, Kick.
Brake!

15:44.750 --> 15:46.792
Can’t brake.
Won’t make it.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.959
[Gunther screams]
We’re going to make it.

15:55.458 --> 15:59.250
[gasps]
I love air.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.625
This isn’t over!

16:00.625 --> 16:02.041
Looks like it to me.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.625
Oh, yeah?
You better look closer.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.625
And you better go
back to Third Street.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.542
Yeah, and-- What?
I can’t-- What?

16:09.542 --> 16:10.583
What?

16:10.583 --> 16:11.583
What?

16:11.583 --> 16:12.667
What?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.208

16:14.208 --> 16:15.500
No, Kick, look.

[cell phone rings]

16:26.500 --> 16:27.667
Hello?

16:27.667 --> 16:29.667
Kick, I can’t get ahold
of Brad.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.792
Are you with him?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.625
Uh, we’re--

16:32.625 --> 16:34.542
Well, tell him to hurry.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.792
The guests
are getting desperate.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.792
No problem.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.125
Are you--

16:45.125 --> 16:46.458
Are you under water?

16:46.458 --> 16:48.583
[Man] Enough’s enough.
It’s too hot.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.875
Wait. Where are you going?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.125
Out of this heat.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.834
I’m sweating like a turkey
in November.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.792
Boo.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.542
Please.

16:58.542 --> 17:01.625
I’m sure Brad will be back
with those cold treats

17:01.625 --> 17:03.375
any minute now.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.917
Excuse me, Janelle,

17:08.917 --> 17:11.542
think you can break a fiver?

17:11.542 --> 17:14.166
Uh, do you smell butter?

17:14.166 --> 17:15.792
Why? Do you like it?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.000
[screaming]

17:22.333 --> 17:23.709
[Gunther] I still love air

17:23.709 --> 17:24.917

17:24.917 --> 17:26.208
I love ground.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.000
Yee-ha-ha-haw!

17:30.208 --> 17:34.125
I have to admit
their persistence
is admirable.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.375
Hang on.
We’re going underground.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.125
[Gunther]
I’m afraid of the dark.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.291
And drafts.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.125
But the last one
doesn’t apply.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.750
Time to serve them up
some justice.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.625
[Chief Bandit screaming]
Low fat vanilla!

17:55.625 --> 17:56.625
You’re mine!

17:58.000 --> 18:00.083
Kick, they’re coming back

18:00.083 --> 18:01.583
in an old, abandoned mine car.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.125
Where did they even get
an old, abandoned mine car?

18:04.125 --> 18:07.583
Where in tarnation did I park
my old, abandoned mine car?

18:07.583 --> 18:08.750
[Chief Bandit] Get closer.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.125
I want that creamy treat!

18:11.125 --> 18:12.166
Why, thank you.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.000
Why don’t you take
the easy way out

18:17.000 --> 18:18.750
and hand over the ice cream?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.083
I don’t do easy.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.750
I’ll do easy.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.750
Kick, stalagmite dead ahead.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.000
Or is it stalactite?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.417
I can never remember
because--

18:27.417 --> 18:28.583

18:31.792 --> 18:33.166

we had to make like a banana

18:33.166 --> 18:34.375
and split.

18:34.375 --> 18:36.250
Boo.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.583
This still isn’t over!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.000
We’ll get you yet!

18:39.000 --> 18:40.417
We never give up!

18:40.417 --> 18:41.959
You know,
I’m still not feeling it.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.125
Hang on.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.959

[Chief Bandit laughs]
Thanks, boys!

19:03.709 --> 19:06.500
Nothing like ice cream
on a hot day.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.792

Peace.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.291
They took all
the Cowboy Kelly wagon wheels.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.291
Did they?

19:14.125 --> 19:16.333
The Cowboy Kelly bars.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.583
Yep. Come on, Gunther.
Gotta move.

I’ve got going.

19:33.792 --> 19:37.834
On such a hot day,
what would you recommend
to cool off?

I’ve got just the thing
you’re looking for,
