00:00.031 --> 00:01.538
Previously on Awkward...

00:01.563 --> 00:03.139
Party's not for me, hot tits.

00:03.164 --> 00:04.497
It's for your knocked-up mama.

00:04.499 --> 00:06.865
I know that I have to
earn your forgiveness.

00:06.867 --> 00:08.467
What has gotten into you?

00:08.469 --> 00:10.636
I have this great new boyfriend
that I want you to meet.

00:10.638 --> 00:11.704
Just let her go.

00:11.706 --> 00:13.410
You had your chance.

00:13.435 --> 00:14.902
I love Matty.

00:15.344 --> 00:16.944
Only 23 days left of high school,

00:16.946 --> 00:18.593
and while most seniors were stressing

00:18.602 --> 00:20.260
over college decision day,

00:20.285 --> 00:21.650
I was at peace,

00:21.651 --> 00:23.350
because I had already committed to Wycoff.

00:23.352 --> 00:25.486
That meant the only
major decision left for me

00:25.488 --> 00:28.590
was when and how to tell
Matty McKibben I loved him.

00:28.592 --> 00:30.859
We just had our first ultrasound.

00:30.884 --> 00:32.839
The sex of the baby is in this envelope.

00:32.864 --> 00:34.630
- You want to hear my guess?
- Shut it, Kevin.

00:34.632 --> 00:36.359
I hope it's a girl. I want a little sister.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.984
Whoa, let's not tear into
that like it's a gas bill.

00:38.992 --> 00:40.000
Don't you want to know?

00:40.008 --> 00:41.896
Well, there's this new
thing people are doing...

00:41.921 --> 00:43.990
a gender reveal party.

00:44.015 --> 00:45.934
You send a bakery a sealed envelope,

00:45.959 --> 00:47.658
and they make a cake... pink or blue...

00:47.660 --> 00:49.027
and cover it with white icing,

00:49.029 --> 00:51.495
and when you cut into it at the party,

00:51.497 --> 00:53.965
everyone finds out the
sex of the baby together.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.164
Or we could just open the envelope.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.468
I mean, usually,

00:56.488 --> 00:58.546
it's a party that's
thrown by your best friend,

00:58.555 --> 00:59.554
but Val's MIA

00:59.568 --> 01:01.668
and Ally's too drunk past
noon to keep a secret,

01:01.670 --> 01:03.103
so, um...

01:03.105 --> 01:06.132
I guess I'm out of luck.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.208
What if I throw the party for you?

01:09.210 --> 01:10.642
Would you?

01:10.644 --> 01:12.044
It's just that I didn't get to celebrate

01:12.046 --> 01:13.412
the first time around,

01:13.414 --> 01:15.443
and I really want to make this one special.

01:15.468 --> 01:17.913
Wow. Sorry I was so un-special.

01:17.938 --> 01:19.272
Not you.

01:19.274 --> 01:20.473
The pregnancy.

01:20.475 --> 01:21.940
Honey, I was 16.

01:21.942 --> 01:23.709
People weren't exactly jumping up and down.

01:23.711 --> 01:26.111
Nowadays, they get their own reality show.

01:26.113 --> 01:27.179
Okay. Ah!

01:27.181 --> 01:28.514
No peeking.

01:28.516 --> 01:30.650
If you know, I will see it in your eyes,

01:30.652 --> 01:32.284
and the surprise will be ruined.

01:32.286 --> 01:33.551
Don't worry. I got this.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.323
Now I had two big secrets to reveal

01:38.325 --> 01:40.258
when the time was right.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.726
[bleep].

01:41.728 --> 01:44.028
- Too bad one of them was already in the toilet.

01:47.934 --> 01:49.100
What's going on?

01:50.836 --> 01:51.836
Nothing.

01:51.838 --> 01:53.271
Everything's fine in there.

01:53.273 --> 01:54.872
I was thinking about the decorations.

01:54.874 --> 01:57.275
Maybe we should go with
gender-neutral colors.

01:57.277 --> 01:59.376
Green, yellow... not purple.

01:59.378 --> 02:01.378
People read way too much into purple.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.815
What was the right outfit to
tell someone you love them?

02:03.817 --> 02:05.183
Are you listening to me?

02:05.185 --> 02:06.583
What is going on with
you? You look different.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.656
You look...

02:08.020 --> 02:09.152
happy.

02:09.155 --> 02:10.387
It's because I am.

02:10.389 --> 02:12.056
I think I still have feelings for Matty,

02:12.058 --> 02:13.657
and I'm pretty sure

02:13.659 --> 02:15.226
he still has feelings for me.

02:15.228 --> 02:16.427
And I know it's crazy,

02:16.429 --> 02:18.095
but I had this dream about Matty,

02:18.097 --> 02:20.932
and I think our problem is
we're just bad at communicating,

02:20.934 --> 02:23.266
and I just want to put it all out there

02:23.268 --> 02:24.768
and see what happens.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.904
Sweetie, are you sure that's a good idea?

02:27.906 --> 02:29.105
I mean, you've...

02:29.107 --> 02:30.607
you've been down that road before.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.810
Would have thought
you'd be more supportive.

02:32.812 --> 02:34.177
You've always been a fan of Matty.

02:34.179 --> 02:35.713
I am, but...

02:38.460 --> 02:41.685
Sometimes, it's just best to move on.

02:41.687 --> 02:43.620
Look, you have so much
to look forward to...

02:43.622 --> 02:45.789
graduation, college,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.022
my party!

02:47.024 --> 02:48.624
I saw a cake at a friend's shower,

02:48.626 --> 02:51.126
and it was shaped just like a teddy bear.

02:51.128 --> 02:53.028
I would love a cake like that.

02:53.030 --> 02:54.263
We'll get right on that.

02:54.265 --> 02:55.631
Sorry to bore you with my life.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.136
Hey. What's going on?

03:01.138 --> 03:02.872
I'm a horrible person.

03:02.874 --> 03:04.306
Hey...

03:04.308 --> 03:06.242
you are not a horrible person.

03:06.244 --> 03:08.043
Your hormones just make
you act horrible sometimes.

03:08.045 --> 03:11.012
I swear, if you bring up my hormones again,

03:11.014 --> 03:13.181
so help me...

03:13.183 --> 03:14.082
Sorry.

03:17.254 --> 03:18.553
I screwed up, Kevin.

03:18.555 --> 03:20.589
On Spring Break, Matty
came looking for Jenna,

03:20.591 --> 03:23.925
and I told him that it was time to move on.

03:23.927 --> 03:24.826
To leave Jenna alone.

03:24.828 --> 03:26.327
- Oh, Lacey.
- I know.

03:26.329 --> 03:28.210
I shouldn't have intervened.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.432
Tell me I'm a bad parent.

03:30.457 --> 03:32.124
Tell me Jenna's old enough
to make her own decisions.

03:32.126 --> 03:34.593
- Well...
- Who are you to judge me?

03:34.595 --> 03:37.129
I'm the one that's been picking
up the pieces between them

03:37.131 --> 03:38.230
over and over again.

03:38.232 --> 03:40.248
- Do you know how hard that is?
- I can...

03:40.273 --> 03:42.702
Besides, there's nothing
I can do about it now.

03:42.704 --> 03:44.136
- Well, you...
- You know what?

03:44.138 --> 03:46.172
I'll tell her. Anything
to get you off my back.

03:46.174 --> 03:47.171
Ah!

03:48.304 --> 03:51.176
I was determined not to
let my mother spoil my day.

03:51.178 --> 03:53.277
I knew someone who would be happy for me.

03:53.279 --> 03:55.947
Someone who understood that
when love was in your heart,

03:55.949 --> 03:57.562
you had to share it.

03:58.418 --> 03:59.453
Love is dead!

03:59.478 --> 04:01.285
Then again, timing is everything.

04:01.287 --> 04:03.688
T, how long is this dark
journey of yours gonna last?

04:03.690 --> 04:05.590
Sorry to be all Island of Dr. Morose,

04:05.592 --> 04:07.192
but Adam's love for me was real,

04:07.194 --> 04:08.259
and I killed it.

04:08.261 --> 04:10.294
Well, you fired the gun.

04:10.296 --> 04:12.496
- But I loaded it.
- I'm sorry.

04:12.498 --> 04:13.897
It'll get better.

04:13.899 --> 04:15.233
Why don't you come help
me out this weekend?

04:15.235 --> 04:17.301
I'm throwing a gender
reveal party for my mom.

04:17.303 --> 04:19.937
She wants to make a big deal out
of everything for the new baby.

04:19.939 --> 04:22.306
Dial back your green monster, Elphaba.

04:22.308 --> 04:23.774
It totes makes sense.

04:23.776 --> 04:25.175
Her last pregnancy was bleak;

04:25.177 --> 04:26.277
this one's chic.

04:27.613 --> 04:29.146
T, you rhymed.

04:29.148 --> 04:31.147
You're starting to sound
like your old self again.

04:34.017 --> 04:36.052
That's right. Columbia.

04:36.054 --> 04:39.937
Read it and weep for your own complacency.

04:40.559 --> 04:41.758
All right, what do you think, Jake?

04:41.760 --> 04:43.093
You ready to put your flag on the board?

04:43.109 --> 04:46.084
At this point, it's just a coin
flip between safety schools.

04:46.109 --> 04:47.287
Safety schools are for losers.

04:47.312 --> 04:48.592
That's why I didn't apply to any.

04:49.481 --> 04:51.670
Ugh. It's my mom about my lunch again.

04:51.695 --> 04:52.445
What?

04:52.469 --> 04:54.178
I've been spending a few
nights a week at her condo

04:54.203 --> 04:56.007
and she insists on bringing me my lunch.

04:56.016 --> 04:57.242
It's so smothering.

04:57.258 --> 04:58.891
It's a pretty amazing 180 with Darlene.

04:58.893 --> 05:00.526
I never would have seen that coming.

05:00.528 --> 05:02.928
It's gonna take more than
a few weeks of nurturing

05:02.930 --> 05:04.897
and a car to make up for
treating me like [bleep]

05:04.899 --> 05:05.931
most of my life.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.299
But she's trying, though.

05:07.301 --> 05:08.600
There he was...

05:08.602 --> 05:10.368
the man of my dreams.

05:10.370 --> 05:11.235
Literally.

05:11.237 --> 05:12.737
You look really happy today.

05:12.739 --> 05:13.905
So I've been told.

05:13.907 --> 05:15.874
See you're already on the board.

05:15.876 --> 05:17.074
Feels pretty good.

05:17.076 --> 05:19.343
- How about you?
- Got until Monday.

05:19.345 --> 05:21.613
So, are you gonna tell me
what's behind that smile?

05:21.615 --> 05:23.014
Come here.

05:23.016 --> 05:24.968
This must be good.

05:25.585 --> 05:26.885
I hope so.

05:26.887 --> 05:29.653
Um, I had a conversation with drunk Gabby,

05:29.655 --> 05:30.988
and then you came to me in a dream,

05:30.990 --> 05:33.490
which you really didn't
actually need to know,

05:33.492 --> 05:34.758
but the point is,

05:34.760 --> 05:36.127
you and I are really bad at communicating,

05:36.129 --> 05:38.195
sort of like how I'm
flailing around right now,

05:38.197 --> 05:39.297
and I just...

05:39.299 --> 05:42.007
I'm so sorry. I got to take this.

05:43.802 --> 05:44.789
Hello?

05:44.814 --> 05:45.703
Saved by the bell.

05:45.734 --> 05:47.066
I sounded like a crazy person.

05:47.068 --> 05:49.162
I needed to hit the reset on my reveal.

05:49.187 --> 05:50.632
Lose the rambling preamble

05:50.641 --> 05:51.468
and get to the point.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.139
That's really, uh, awesome.

05:53.164 --> 05:54.201
O-okay.

05:54.226 --> 05:55.156
Thanks.

05:56.224 --> 05:58.272
That was the Berkeley soccer coach.

05:58.297 --> 06:00.230
An incoming freshman mid-fielder

06:00.232 --> 06:01.699
just shattered his ankle skateboarding,

06:01.701 --> 06:03.901
which means they have one
more spot to fill on the team

06:03.902 --> 06:05.085
and I got it!

06:05.110 --> 06:06.670
I'm going to Berkeley!

06:06.672 --> 06:08.537
Oh! Way to go!

06:08.539 --> 06:09.905
Right under the wire!

06:09.907 --> 06:11.173
- Whoo!
- I know, right?

06:11.175 --> 06:12.942
And Berkeley is my number one choice.

06:12.944 --> 06:14.476
Until a minute ago, I was worried

06:14.478 --> 06:16.378
I'd end up at one of my safety schools.

06:16.380 --> 06:17.479
And now Berkeley!

06:17.481 --> 06:20.649
Well, put your flag on the board, man.

06:20.651 --> 06:23.285
I am sorry. What did you want to say?

06:23.287 --> 06:24.887
It was nothing. Congrats.

06:24.889 --> 06:26.101
Really.

06:28.524 --> 06:29.991
Sorry to bother you.

06:29.993 --> 06:31.659
It's sushi from Kaiku's.

06:31.661 --> 06:33.027
I hope that's all right.

06:33.029 --> 06:34.696
That's fine. I guess there's no easy way

06:34.698 --> 06:36.281
to get a hot lunch to school.

06:36.306 --> 06:37.640
Oh. Okay.

06:37.924 --> 06:39.296
Have a good day, sweetie.

06:40.169 --> 06:41.125
Mom.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.270
Is your boyfriend still
coming into town this weekend?

06:43.272 --> 06:44.367
Yes.

06:44.392 --> 06:47.341
But you don't need to meet
Ted until you're ready.

06:47.343 --> 06:48.509
I'm ready.

06:48.511 --> 06:49.774
Okay.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.207
I really want to know
what you think of him.

06:52.232 --> 06:53.757
Your approval means a lot.

06:56.335 --> 06:57.918
The moment had arrived.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.320
Matty was alone at lunch.

06:59.322 --> 07:01.355
After royally screwing up my first attempt,

07:01.357 --> 07:03.619
nothing was gonna stop me now.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.860
Matty.

07:06.862 --> 07:08.904
These last three years have been crazy,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.432
but through it all,
there's been one constant.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.300
You.

07:14.302 --> 07:15.235
I love you.

07:16.337 --> 07:18.571
I...love you.

07:18.573 --> 07:20.039
I love you too.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.182
Jatty. Jatty. Jatty.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.925
Earth to Hamilturd.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.493
You're blocking the way.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.331
Hey.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.035
What are you doing Saturday?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.870
Jake and I are going to
the pier Saturday night.

07:51.872 --> 07:52.937
Come with us.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.226
You too, Sadie.

07:54.251 --> 07:56.074
Darn, I have plans.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.677
Actually, I was thinking more just...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.145
you and I.

08:00.147 --> 08:00.912
Alone.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.480
Oh. Uh...

08:02.482 --> 08:03.581
Sure.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.283
You gonna tell me what this is about?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.317
Saturday.

08:07.839 --> 08:11.037
Well, if that's as fluffy
as you can get it, it's fine.

08:11.062 --> 08:13.329
Thankfully, this gender
reveal would be over soon,

08:13.331 --> 08:15.205
and I'd be free to go to dinner with Matty

08:15.230 --> 08:16.065
for my big reveal.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.191
Hey.

08:17.535 --> 08:19.916
Why don't we go out to dinner
and celebrate after the party?

08:19.941 --> 08:21.258
I can't. I have plans.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.292
I'm going out with Matty.

08:22.308 --> 08:24.682
Uh, your mom has something
she needs to talk to you about.

08:24.707 --> 08:25.840
I don't want to fight.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.308
Good. Hold that thought.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.282
Back on Spring Break,

08:32.284 --> 08:35.684
something happened that I
should have told you about.

08:36.269 --> 08:38.255
Matty came to the house looking for you,

08:38.256 --> 08:40.557
and I sent him away

08:40.558 --> 08:42.058
and told him to leave you alone.

08:42.059 --> 08:43.427
Why would you do that?

08:43.429 --> 08:46.062
You helped him find his dad
and then he just left you,

08:46.064 --> 08:48.398
and I was really mad at him.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.733
Well, so was I.

08:49.735 --> 08:52.369
I... I thought I was helping.

08:52.371 --> 08:54.404
Interfering is not helping.

08:54.406 --> 08:56.606
It's bad enough that you
told him to stay away,

08:56.608 --> 08:58.307
but the fact that you're
just telling me now?

08:58.309 --> 09:00.343
Because I was worried that
you wouldn't understand

09:00.345 --> 09:02.077
and you would be mad at me.

09:02.079 --> 09:04.313
I have a right to know what's
really going on in my life,

09:04.315 --> 09:05.414
whether it is good or bad.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.002
And I realize that now, sweetie,

09:07.027 --> 09:08.960
but you were smiling with Brian

09:08.962 --> 09:10.795
and Matty had hurt you so bad,

09:10.797 --> 09:13.980
and I really thought that I was helping.

09:13.996 --> 09:16.644
When in fact all you were
doing was getting in the way.

09:17.621 --> 09:19.887
Can we just talk about this later?

09:20.857 --> 09:22.322
I'm coming!

09:22.324 --> 09:24.391
So when does soccer
training start for Berkeley?

09:24.393 --> 09:26.293
I don't know. I haven't
officially committed yet.

09:26.295 --> 09:27.895
Why not? I would have
committed over the phone

09:27.897 --> 09:29.563
before they could change their minds.

09:29.565 --> 09:31.832
I'm just going over
everything one more time.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.994
Ferry, New Hampshire, UCSB...

09:34.019 --> 09:35.235
they're good schools too.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.821
None of those can compete with Berkeley.

09:36.823 --> 09:37.737
That's Division 1.

09:37.762 --> 09:39.694
Yeah, I'm like 90% going to Berkeley.

09:39.696 --> 09:40.562
Damn right.

09:40.564 --> 09:42.091
We're celebrating tonight.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.597
Oh, I kind of made other plans.

09:44.622 --> 09:46.488
I'm going out with Jenna.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.605
Oh, better not turn your back on me.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.039
- Ah!
- Oh.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.542
Game over.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.477
What? She asked me out.

09:55.479 --> 09:57.445
Jenna's going to Wycoff, in Maine.

09:57.447 --> 09:59.414
Suddenly, you're considering Ferry,

09:59.416 --> 10:00.682
in Maine.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.683
Seriously, dude?

10:01.685 --> 10:03.484
I'm going to Berkeley, okay?

10:03.486 --> 10:04.919
All week, she's been sending signals,

10:04.921 --> 10:06.821
like maybe she wants to get back together.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.423
You are reading a lot into one date.

10:09.425 --> 10:11.225
We might have gotten
together on Spring Break

10:11.227 --> 10:12.493
if I hadn't screwed things up.

10:12.495 --> 10:13.961
She didn't seem too broken up.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.096
And she moved on pretty
quick with the Marine.

10:16.098 --> 10:18.824
A lot of people moved on
pretty quick in Mexico.

10:19.258 --> 10:20.019
Point taken.

10:20.044 --> 10:21.175
It's just...

10:21.402 --> 10:23.270
any time she looks your way,

10:23.272 --> 10:24.662
you're ready to jump.

10:25.807 --> 10:27.741
Well, the first couple of weeks,

10:27.743 --> 10:30.411
I craved beef jerky, just like with Jenna.

10:30.413 --> 10:32.212
And then, suddenly,

10:32.214 --> 10:33.547
jerky made me want to hurl,

10:33.549 --> 10:35.527
and now I'm craving healthy foods.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.584
It's so interesting.

10:37.586 --> 10:40.043
It's so not.

10:40.722 --> 10:42.556
Little bitch. Fill 'er up.

10:45.825 --> 10:46.792
Tamara.

10:46.794 --> 10:47.993
You're missing the party,

10:47.995 --> 10:49.662
and how the new baby craves healthy foods

10:49.664 --> 10:50.910
and I only craved crap.

10:50.935 --> 10:52.698
Your #babymamadrama

10:52.700 --> 10:53.799
has to retire.

10:53.801 --> 10:54.902
When we were in Mexico,

10:54.927 --> 10:56.602
she told Matty to stay away from me.

10:56.604 --> 10:58.471
I can kind of see her point.

10:58.473 --> 10:59.385
Really?

10:59.410 --> 11:00.605
Can't wait any longer.

11:00.629 --> 11:02.495
If she tells another story
while I'm still sober,

11:02.497 --> 11:03.878
I may kill her.

11:04.466 --> 11:06.165
I can't believe you're taking her side.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.167
It's not really about taking sides, Jenna.

11:08.169 --> 11:10.069
It's...

11:10.648 --> 11:12.038
Ally, no! That's for the...

11:12.040 --> 11:13.273
Gender reveal.

11:13.275 --> 11:15.141
No one can know that it's pink inside.

11:15.143 --> 11:16.827
Don't tell anyone.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.041
Relax. It's not like I'm
dying to spread the word

11:19.066 --> 11:21.166
your mom's having another little bitch.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.816
Oh, funny and smart.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.844
Just as amazing as your mom said you were.

11:28.869 --> 11:30.102
I know.

11:30.141 --> 11:31.417
You're welcome.

11:31.419 --> 11:33.653
You know, it is so great
to finally meet you.

11:33.680 --> 11:34.984
When I was here in September,

11:35.017 --> 11:36.884
your mom said you were too
busy applying to colleges.

11:36.886 --> 11:39.654
Oh. Did she?

11:39.656 --> 11:40.688
It is wonderful

11:40.690 --> 11:42.222
how attuned to you Darlene is,

11:42.224 --> 11:44.581
even though you've had to
live in different cities.

11:44.606 --> 11:45.526
Yeah.

11:45.528 --> 11:47.594
It's like she's freaking
psychic or something.

11:50.731 --> 11:52.131
Jenna, this isn't working.

11:52.133 --> 11:54.347
Looks like the bear took a dump.

11:54.372 --> 11:56.621
Let me go to the store
and get some white icing.

11:56.645 --> 11:57.558
That'll take too long.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.042
I'm going out as soon as this is over.

11:59.067 --> 11:59.755
Where?

11:59.775 --> 12:01.408
What if I told you that I
think I'm in love with Matty

12:01.410 --> 12:02.842
and I'm going out with
him tonight to tell him?

12:02.844 --> 12:05.464
I would say that it's too late.

12:05.489 --> 12:07.208
That the time for shipping Matty and Jenna

12:07.232 --> 12:09.533
has sailed and sunk multiple times.

12:09.535 --> 12:10.918
That's a mean thing to say,

12:10.943 --> 12:11.856
but I'm gonna let it go,

12:11.880 --> 12:13.412
'cause you're still in a
weird space because of Adam.

12:13.414 --> 12:15.513
Sorry to debunk your Big Blame Theory,

12:15.537 --> 12:18.103
but the two of you were
never good for each other.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.380
Even if you do manage to not screw it up

12:20.396 --> 12:22.099
before school's out, then what?

12:22.115 --> 12:23.014
You two are going to college

12:23.015 --> 12:24.314
on opposite sides of the country.

12:24.316 --> 12:25.549
All I know is that I love him.

12:25.551 --> 12:27.017
I loved Adam.

12:27.019 --> 12:28.352
And I still hurt him.

12:28.354 --> 12:30.654
Because I didn't think
things through all the way.

12:30.656 --> 12:33.190
I thought you of all
people would understand.

12:33.192 --> 12:34.824
All right, well, let's go cut this cake

12:34.826 --> 12:36.419
so I can get out of here.

12:40.631 --> 12:41.765
Where's Mom?

12:41.767 --> 12:43.099
She's gone to pee.

12:43.101 --> 12:44.528
Another thing pregnant women talk about

12:44.553 --> 12:46.911
as if it's a Silicon Valley stock tip.

12:47.638 --> 12:49.505
Where do you guys want this?

12:49.507 --> 12:50.941
Oh, just put it, uh,

12:50.966 --> 12:53.076
yeah, right about... but don't...

12:53.078 --> 12:53.943
Oh!

12:53.945 --> 12:55.745
It's part of the gender reveal.

12:55.747 --> 12:57.413
Okay. I already knew.

12:57.415 --> 12:58.302
You knew?

12:58.327 --> 12:59.730
Yeah, I was at the ultrasound.

12:59.755 --> 13:01.817
Get these balloons back in!

13:01.819 --> 13:03.285
Ohh!

13:04.454 --> 13:06.394
Hey! Time to cut the cake.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.138
Come on. Let's cut it together.

13:08.481 --> 13:09.792
Oh. Big box.

13:15.631 --> 13:18.432
Kevin cut the cord when Jenna was born.

13:18.434 --> 13:19.801
Just cut the damn cake.

13:21.369 --> 13:22.704
I'm back!

13:26.161 --> 13:27.782
I couldn't commit to Biggie

13:27.807 --> 13:29.758
until I had a chance to see the world,

13:29.783 --> 13:32.544
so I decided to pull an "Eat, Play, Love."

13:32.546 --> 13:33.850
I skipped the Ashram part.

13:33.851 --> 13:36.091
Curry doesn't always agree with me.

13:36.116 --> 13:40.685
You don't want to know what
curry does to a pregnant woman.

13:40.687 --> 13:41.886
No, we really don't.

13:41.888 --> 13:45.090
You know, what I think
makes the world so incredible

13:45.092 --> 13:46.424
is the people.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.428
I met Enzo at a little
gelato shop on the piazza.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.462
He taught me Italian,

13:50.464 --> 13:52.797
which is the language of love.

13:52.799 --> 13:53.831
Who's ready for cake?

13:53.833 --> 13:54.998
Then there was Ian.

13:55.023 --> 13:58.334
He bought me a warm beer
in a real Yorkshire pub.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.371
The English are so nutty.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.772
They call fries "chips" and...

14:01.774 --> 14:03.808
Where are you going? You
still have to cut the cake.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.142
You mean my damn cake?

14:05.144 --> 14:06.506
You can't leave your own party.

14:06.531 --> 14:07.936
Nobody cares.

14:07.952 --> 14:10.486
They would rather hear Val's
stories than mine anyway.

14:10.488 --> 14:13.723
Okay, you are acting like
a baby at your own shower.

14:13.725 --> 14:14.924
Get back in there with your friends

14:14.926 --> 14:16.091
and your gender neutral streamers

14:16.093 --> 14:17.392
and your teddy bear cake

14:17.394 --> 14:19.027
that I had to call four
bakeries just to find

14:19.029 --> 14:20.562
so that you could have your perfect party.

14:20.564 --> 14:22.560
But the bear cake that I wanted was taller.

14:22.585 --> 14:23.858
You know what? That's it.

14:23.882 --> 14:25.022
I've had enough.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.405
For someone who wants to control
every single little thing,

14:27.421 --> 14:29.654
including who can and can't talk to me,

14:29.656 --> 14:32.489
there's one thing that you
can't seem to get a grasp on:

14:32.514 --> 14:33.625
birth control.

14:33.627 --> 14:35.059
Word.

14:39.507 --> 14:41.074
My bad. I've got this.

14:47.819 --> 14:50.219
- Sorry.
- No, you were right.

14:50.221 --> 14:53.678
I just wanted this party
to be perfect because...

14:54.092 --> 14:56.927
I want everything to be
perfect for this baby.

14:58.362 --> 15:01.097
I want to be a better
parent this time around.

15:01.498 --> 15:02.833
You're not that bad.

15:07.303 --> 15:09.268
I'm really sorry for interfering.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.107
And it's killing me to think
that if it weren't for me,

15:12.109 --> 15:14.522
you and Matty might have gotten
back together on Spring Break

15:14.547 --> 15:16.111
and been happy this whole time.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.180
I was furious with Matty that night.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.348
Who knows what I would have said

15:19.350 --> 15:20.850
if he'd have found me with Brian.

15:20.852 --> 15:23.919
So maybe it's a good thing I sent him away?

15:23.921 --> 15:25.320
Maybe it's a very good thing.

15:25.322 --> 15:27.923
I mean, now I know better.

15:27.925 --> 15:29.892
I know what I want.

15:29.871 --> 15:32.068
I just hope it's not too late.

15:32.093 --> 15:34.493
You can still make the
most of every moment.

15:34.495 --> 15:36.262
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:36.264 --> 15:38.797
There is still a chance for Matty and me.

15:42.268 --> 15:44.802
So, in the end, I was right to interfere.

15:44.804 --> 15:46.003
Ah... too soon.

15:46.005 --> 15:47.353
Damn, I knew it.

15:47.678 --> 15:49.644
You guys have the same mannerisms.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.690
It's like you're two peas in a pod.

15:52.412 --> 15:53.811
- Oh!
- Oh, honey.

15:53.813 --> 15:55.112
Oh, shoot.

15:55.114 --> 15:56.080
Let me get a waiter.

15:56.082 --> 15:57.459
Oh, my gosh.

15:57.817 --> 15:59.064
Just...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.091
I won't be long.

16:01.179 --> 16:02.512
Excuse me.

16:04.351 --> 16:05.284
Wow.

16:05.286 --> 16:07.620
Your mom is really something.

16:07.622 --> 16:09.388
Yeah. She is something.

16:09.390 --> 16:11.490
You know, two years apart
can't have been easy,

16:11.515 --> 16:15.288
but it sounds like with the
constant texting and Skyping,

16:15.304 --> 16:17.237
you both found a way to make it work.

16:17.239 --> 16:19.105
Almost sounds too good to be true.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.875
I blotted most of it out.

16:21.877 --> 16:23.677
I'm such a klutz.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.311
You know me.

16:25.313 --> 16:26.713
Oh.

16:26.715 --> 16:29.850
I know you better than ever.

16:29.852 --> 16:31.317
And I am so looking forward

16:31.319 --> 16:33.119
to helping Ted get to know you

16:33.121 --> 16:35.922
just as well as I do, Mom.

16:38.827 --> 16:40.059
There she is!

16:40.061 --> 16:41.260
Come on. Let's get this cake cut,

16:41.262 --> 16:43.467
and we can welcome this girl into...

16:44.569 --> 16:45.536
[bleep].

16:45.561 --> 16:47.161
It's a girl?

16:47.163 --> 16:48.498
I'm having a girl?

16:49.846 --> 16:51.014
You already know?

16:52.710 --> 16:53.543
A girl.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.591
Does everyone know but me?

16:55.616 --> 16:57.514
Got to love first world toilets.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.915
What does everyone know?

16:58.917 --> 17:01.618
It's a girl. You don't
have to act surprised.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.785
A girl?

17:02.787 --> 17:05.670
Oh! I am so glad I'm here for this.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.222
I have missed you so much.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.425
How in the world did you
travel to all those places

17:09.426 --> 17:10.593
in such a short time?

17:10.595 --> 17:11.780
It wasn't really that hard.

17:11.805 --> 17:13.521
Epcot is very compact.

17:13.546 --> 17:14.413
Epcot?

17:14.438 --> 17:15.869
That's where you did your world travel?

17:15.882 --> 17:17.615
I find it more realistic than Vegas.

17:17.617 --> 17:19.251
I have spread my wings,

17:19.252 --> 17:21.607
and now I'm ready to have them clipped

17:21.632 --> 17:22.685
and marry Biggie.

17:22.704 --> 17:23.737
Marry?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.037
Did Biggie propose?

17:25.039 --> 17:27.076
I can tell he's ready
to take the next step.

17:27.101 --> 17:29.035
He's been getting allergy shots.

17:29.038 --> 17:30.905
I can't believe it. I'm having a girl!

17:30.921 --> 17:32.354
I'm having a husband!

17:36.085 --> 17:36.966
This is weird.

17:36.991 --> 17:38.748
It almost feels like a first date.

17:38.773 --> 17:40.105
Except we're not in a closet.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.197
I don't miss the smell of wet mop.

17:42.199 --> 17:44.965
What course was appropriate
for saying "I love you"?

17:44.967 --> 17:46.734
Probably not one that
allowed the possibility

17:46.736 --> 17:48.030
of lettuce in your teeth.

17:48.055 --> 17:50.438
So crazy that we're about
to graduate high school.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.139
Your parents must be
psyched about Berkeley.

17:52.141 --> 17:53.741
Ah, they're cool with whatever I decide.

17:53.743 --> 17:54.942
I had to make a pros and cons list

17:54.944 --> 17:57.211
to decide between Wycoff and Wycoff.

17:57.213 --> 17:58.612
I chose Wycoff.

18:00.549 --> 18:02.550
You know I got into Ferry too.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.485
That's only a couple hours from Wycoff.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.020
I thought you wanted to play soccer.

18:07.022 --> 18:09.056
Well, Ferry offered me
a spot on their team.

18:09.058 --> 18:11.413
Division 3, but it's competitive.

18:11.994 --> 18:14.107
I kind of like the idea
of a smaller school.

18:14.132 --> 18:16.363
If small is what you're going for,

18:16.365 --> 18:17.397
Ferry's the one.

18:17.422 --> 18:19.566
And living somewhere where
it snows could be fun.

18:19.568 --> 18:21.268
Berkeley was his future.

18:21.270 --> 18:24.099
I couldn't guarantee whether
Matty and I would make it.

18:24.124 --> 18:25.491
Decision day had come.

18:25.534 --> 18:28.186
It was time to grow up
and do the mature thing.

18:28.202 --> 18:30.336
If I truly loved Matty,

18:30.338 --> 18:31.507
I had to let him go.

18:31.531 --> 18:32.858
You should go to Berkeley.

18:32.883 --> 18:34.288
I don't know.

18:35.054 --> 18:37.188
There's a lot of ski resorts in Maine.

18:37.264 --> 18:40.438
We could meet up on the
weekends and hit the slopes.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.807
To be honest, I sort of hate skiing.

18:42.809 --> 18:44.642
Well, we could meet up afterwards.

18:44.644 --> 18:46.444
In front of a cozy, warm fire.

18:46.446 --> 18:49.447
I'm probably gonna be swamped
on the weekends with homework.

18:50.582 --> 18:51.827
Okay.

18:51.852 --> 18:53.160
I get it.

18:53.874 --> 18:55.273
So, what are we doing here?

18:55.514 --> 18:57.755
And what'd you want to tell me so bad?

18:58.178 --> 19:01.659
I finally understood why my
mom did what she did in Mexico,

19:01.661 --> 19:03.060
and I could forgive her.

19:03.085 --> 19:04.562
Now I was the one withholding

19:04.564 --> 19:06.997
some major information from Matty...

19:06.999 --> 19:08.298
that I loved him.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.134
But would I ever forgive
myself for letting Matty go?

19:11.136 --> 19:13.737
We are celebrating.

19:13.739 --> 19:15.405
You got into Berkeley.

19:15.407 --> 19:16.739
And that's awesome.

19:16.741 --> 19:18.775
And I am so happy for you.

19:18.777 --> 19:21.544
And I was just wanting to say that...

19:22.813 --> 19:24.781
I hope we can stay really close friends

19:24.783 --> 19:27.083
once we live on opposite
sides of the country.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.074

That was fun.

19:44.435 --> 19:45.800
It was fun.

19:47.038 --> 19:48.170
Night.

19:48.172 --> 19:49.175
Good night.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.124
I couldn't say it.

Next on Awkward...

20:32.702 --> 20:35.317
It was the most romantic
time of the high school year:

20:35.342 --> 20:36.541
prom-posal season.

20:36.543 --> 20:38.239
There should be a do-not-ask list.

20:38.264 --> 20:39.797
Jenna, that is I Dream of Genius.

20:39.799 --> 20:41.365
Avoid the tyranny of prom

20:41.367 --> 20:44.035
that corporate America is
forcing on you, sheeple.

20:44.037 --> 20:46.177
Prom is the most important
event of our senior year

20:46.202 --> 20:47.327
before graduation.

20:47.362 --> 20:48.862
Go with someone you love.

20:48.864 --> 20:49.929
I love you.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.750
Will you go to prom with me?
