00:36.197 --> 00:37.230
H-Hey, what?

00:38.266 --> 00:40.333
Oh! Oh, cleats!

00:40.368 --> 00:42.369
Homie, what happened?

00:42.403 --> 00:45.906
Uh... maybe
some easy-listening music

00:45.940 --> 00:48.241
will make you feel better
about the story.

00:48.276 --> 00:49.676
Turn on 89.9.

00:52.413 --> 00:55.715
Like most of my problems,
it all started at Moe's...

00:55.750 --> 00:57.884
All right, so the rules are

00:57.919 --> 00:59.886
every time the news
guy says "senator,"

00:59.921 --> 01:01.688
we got to take a drink.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.356
Huh. It'll be nice
to let someone else decide

01:03.391 --> 01:05.325
when I drink--
too much pressure.

01:06.461 --> 01:08.195
Uh, yeah, Channel Six tip line?

01:08.229 --> 01:10.864
I just caught two senators
doin' it in the alley.

01:10.898 --> 01:12.866
And me?
I'm just a reliable source.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.968
Not "sauce," "source."

01:15.002 --> 01:17.737
Source! S-A-U-R-C-E!

01:17.772 --> 01:20.740
We have heard
from a very reliable sauce

01:20.775 --> 01:23.376
news involving
multiple senators.

01:23.411 --> 01:25.111
I'm going to read a list
of senators,

01:25.146 --> 01:27.080
with possibly more senators
to be named later

01:27.114 --> 01:29.950
by other senators:
Senator Abercrombie,

01:29.984 --> 01:33.053
Senator Billingsley,
Senator Beaumont...

01:35.623 --> 01:38.625
Hmm? Oh, damn,
the plaster's flaking again.

01:40.161 --> 01:41.528
<i>Once intoxicated,</i>
<i>we had a great idea.</i>

01:41.562 --> 01:43.697
Hey! Swings!

01:45.399 --> 01:47.200
I'm a kid again!

01:49.070 --> 01:50.537
Oh... gah...

01:50.571 --> 01:51.705
I'll save you!

01:55.476 --> 01:57.911
Oh, the only way out is in!

01:57.945 --> 01:59.112
Hey, look at me!

01:59.146 --> 02:01.648
I'm going <i>up</i> a slide!

02:01.682 --> 02:03.817
Homer! Homer!

02:03.851 --> 02:05.485
Best recess ever!

02:07.188 --> 02:08.088
Whoa.

02:08.122 --> 02:09.422
Help me, guys! Guys?

02:10.958 --> 02:12.592
Don't worry, Homer,
I'll call the cops!

02:12.627 --> 02:14.127
I'll write
my senator.

02:14.161 --> 02:16.162
Senator!
Senator!

02:17.198 --> 02:19.099
Oh, am I gonna die
on a playground,

02:19.133 --> 02:22.636
like some uncoordinated child?

02:22.670 --> 02:25.038
But I did learn something
from all this:

02:25.072 --> 02:29.075
the sprinklers in this park
come on at 3:00 a.m.

02:30.211 --> 02:32.112
Hey, thanks for
throwing the ball back.

02:32.146 --> 02:33.313
Really.

02:34.549 --> 02:36.783
I'll come back
with the fire truck.

02:36.817 --> 02:39.686
I just have to get the kids
to school first.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.121
Oh, are the kids with you?

02:41.155 --> 02:42.289
- Hi, Dad.
- Homer.

02:42.323 --> 02:44.558
Hey, guys! Why are you
ducked-down like that?

02:44.592 --> 02:46.693
Don't want to be seen with
you when you're hitting bottom.

02:46.727 --> 02:48.328
At least
we hope it's bottom.

02:48.362 --> 02:51.131
Don't worry,
it's bottom, all right.

02:55.536 --> 02:56.836
<i>And that's why</i>

02:56.871 --> 02:58.338
I was tardy today.

02:58.372 --> 03:00.340
And with that tardiness,
you have at last crossed

03:00.374 --> 03:03.143
the boundary where I can legally
apply physical discipline.

03:03.177 --> 03:04.811
Willie,
cut me a switch!

03:04.845 --> 03:07.480
What about the one
your ma used on you?

03:07.515 --> 03:09.482
It, uh, broke on my buttocks.

03:09.517 --> 03:13.320
Serves you right for eating jam
straight out of the jar.

03:14.488 --> 03:17.157
Damn it! That's not
even a swivel chair.

03:18.392 --> 03:21.361
Skate, skate
as fast as you can.

03:21.395 --> 03:23.897
But I'll catch you--
I'm the Principal Man!

03:23.931 --> 03:25.966
That's the kind of education
you're missing.

03:30.538 --> 03:32.105
Oh, no. Uphill.

03:32.139 --> 03:33.840
The one place my car can't go.

03:39.046 --> 03:41.014
Uh, would you like a quote?

03:41.048 --> 03:42.349
Uh, yes.

03:42.383 --> 03:44.351
"Some cause happiness
wherever they go;

03:44.385 --> 03:47.087
others whenever they go."
Oscar Wilde.

03:47.121 --> 03:49.956
Uh, P.S.
Your car is totaled.

03:51.692 --> 03:53.660
Whew! Safe.

03:53.694 --> 03:56.162
Oh, not totally.

03:56.197 --> 03:57.297
Whoa!

03:57.331 --> 03:58.999
What-what are you doing in here?

03:59.033 --> 04:00.567
Hiding from the cops.

04:00.601 --> 04:02.636
Well, I can't have cops
sniffing around here.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.304
Some of them might be girls.

04:04.338 --> 04:05.805
Can't I just stay a little?

04:05.840 --> 04:09.042
I only committed this robbery
to help my kid.

04:09.076 --> 04:10.543
See, this is Jeremy.

04:10.578 --> 04:11.878
I need to get him braces.

04:11.912 --> 04:13.880
I always thought
that if I'd had braces,

04:13.914 --> 04:16.016
I'd have smiled more.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.017
Hey, I bet
you have a great smile.

04:18.052 --> 04:19.019
Huh?

04:19.053 --> 04:20.286
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

04:20.321 --> 04:22.288
Bart, Bart, we're in
whatchamacallit...

04:22.323 --> 04:23.757
a pursuit!

04:23.791 --> 04:24.791
So why'd you come here?

04:24.825 --> 04:26.760
I run a respectable tree house.

04:26.794 --> 04:28.161
Just wondering
if you've seen anything.

04:28.195 --> 04:31.231
Uh, word is you'll, uh...
you'll snitch for candy.

04:31.265 --> 04:33.933
You can't buy me with
a candy bar that has coconut.

04:33.968 --> 04:36.770
Then maybe this is more your...
neighborhood.

04:36.804 --> 04:37.771
Nice real estate.

04:37.805 --> 04:39.239
You got a deal.

04:39.273 --> 04:40.507
So, what do you know?

04:40.541 --> 04:44.711
I saw a guy with a gun
and a snake tattoo...

04:44.745 --> 04:47.881
say he was gonna hide out
on top of Mount Springfield.

04:47.915 --> 04:49.816
Mount Springfield, eh?

04:49.850 --> 04:52.318
Strap on your crampons, boys!

04:52.353 --> 04:54.821
Eddie! Prepare my litter!

04:54.855 --> 04:56.156
Lou, you are responsible

04:56.190 --> 04:58.958
for my oxygen, food, water
and cleaning!

04:58.993 --> 05:00.927
You have to clean me.
I clean you. Yeah.

05:00.961 --> 05:01.928
Dude, thank you.

05:01.962 --> 05:03.430
Why did you save me?

05:03.464 --> 05:05.331
We outlaws have
to stick together.

05:05.366 --> 05:07.033
Outlaw? You?

05:07.068 --> 05:09.703
Stolen bowling shoes,
3-D glasses, Krusty standee

05:09.737 --> 05:12.038
and this "cage" for my pet.

05:12.073 --> 05:13.940
Oh. What do you feed him?

05:13.974 --> 05:15.341
My A.D.D. meds.

05:17.111 --> 05:18.745
Um, listen,

05:18.779 --> 05:21.581
would you like two tickets
to the school musical?

05:21.615 --> 05:24.250
My son plays the butcher.

05:24.285 --> 05:25.952
In <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

05:25.986 --> 05:27.787
I'm busy that night.

05:27.822 --> 05:29.355
Yeah, lucky you.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.194
Huh?

05:36.564 --> 05:39.132
Are you okay?

05:39.166 --> 05:41.067
Don't put more
in there!

05:41.102 --> 05:42.602
Going for the record.

05:42.636 --> 05:45.271
What record?
Stupidest death?

05:45.306 --> 05:47.140
Aah!

05:49.176 --> 05:50.543
Blagh!

05:50.578 --> 05:52.378
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

05:52.413 --> 05:53.646
Oh, well, you're very wel...

05:53.681 --> 05:55.115
That's French
for "hello."

05:55.149 --> 05:58.118
Actually, I think it...
Lucas Bortner, competitive eater.

05:58.152 --> 05:59.786
A fat kid with a dream?

05:59.820 --> 06:01.921
I can't compete with that.

06:01.956 --> 06:04.524
What does
a competitive eater eat?

06:04.558 --> 06:08.027
All the glamour foods: pizza,
boiled eggs, chicken wings

06:08.062 --> 06:11.564
and the big enchilada, which
is not enchiladas but hot dogs.

06:11.599 --> 06:13.366
69 hot dogs
is the current record.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.001
As the great Kobayashi says,

06:15.035 --> 06:17.403
<i>"Detekurutoki itaiyo."</i>

06:17.438 --> 06:19.005
What does that mean?

06:19.039 --> 06:20.473
"That's gonna hurt coming out."

06:20.508 --> 06:23.143
Is Kobayashi
the number one, um, uh...

06:23.177 --> 06:25.211
The correct term
is "gurgitator."

06:25.246 --> 06:27.113
I won't be using
the correct term then.

06:27.148 --> 06:29.783
Virtually everyone uses
his technique: Japanesing.

06:29.817 --> 06:31.651
Shall I demonstrate?

06:31.685 --> 06:34.821
Um, why don't I just go sit
alone... Oh, you're doing it.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.823
Ready, set...

06:36.857 --> 06:38.858
Japanese!

06:43.330 --> 06:44.497
That's not going down.

06:45.599 --> 06:46.966
This happens
from time to time.

06:47.001 --> 06:49.536
Maybe this isn't
the sport for you.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.004
It's not a sport.

06:51.038 --> 06:52.539
It's my life.

06:52.573 --> 06:54.474
<i>Aw, he's sweet.</i>

06:54.508 --> 06:56.342
<i>What am I doing?</i>

06:56.377 --> 06:58.411
<i>He's just Ralph with a dream.</i>

06:58.445 --> 07:00.346
<i>The dream of not ralphing.</i>

07:00.381 --> 07:03.716
<i>But I'm sure I could</i>
<i>totally change and fix him.</i>

07:03.751 --> 07:06.519
Can I join you for lunch?
Um, sure.

07:06.554 --> 07:08.354
How many whole pizzas
would you like?

07:08.389 --> 07:10.723
Um, can I just have a slice?

07:10.758 --> 07:12.826
Interesting technique.

07:14.829 --> 07:16.262
Whoa.

07:16.297 --> 07:19.065
You didn't tell me you
had a PlayStadium 4!

07:19.099 --> 07:21.868
It's the first
I've seen it.

07:21.902 --> 07:24.404
Something's fishy, Bart.

07:24.438 --> 07:26.339
Where's the gift receipt?

07:26.373 --> 07:29.075
Where's the packet of desiccant
that says "Do not eat"?

07:29.109 --> 07:31.678
And, believe me, you shouldn't.

07:31.712 --> 07:35.215
I have a feeling this
PlayStadium was liberated

07:35.249 --> 07:39.519
from its previous owner and
given to me in gratitude.

07:39.553 --> 07:40.787
Liberated?

07:40.821 --> 07:42.555
You mean "stolen"?

07:42.590 --> 07:44.557
You can't spell "crime"
without "me."

07:44.592 --> 07:46.559
C-R-I...

07:47.595 --> 07:49.529
There it is,
at the end!

07:50.598 --> 07:53.266
Oh, hi. Is-is Lisa home?

07:53.300 --> 07:54.267
Yes, she is.

07:54.301 --> 07:55.568
And who are you?

07:55.603 --> 07:57.570
Lucas.

07:57.605 --> 07:58.972
It's pronounced
"Luca-dollar."

07:59.006 --> 08:00.306
That's my competition name.

08:00.341 --> 08:01.841
I'm a competitive eater.

08:01.876 --> 08:03.176
Competitive eater?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.678
Did I hear right?
I could be a competitive eater?

08:05.713 --> 08:07.413
No! You didn't hear anything!

08:07.448 --> 08:09.549
Yes, I did! I heard
"competitive eater"!

08:09.583 --> 08:12.752
It's for people
who haven't had heart problems.

08:12.786 --> 08:15.021
Then that makes me the
Jackie Robinson of the sport,

08:15.055 --> 08:18.024
and you are the racist
Philadelphia manager.

08:18.058 --> 08:21.027
Quit comparing me
to Ben Chapman.

08:21.061 --> 08:23.496
I will when you open
your mind to change!

08:23.530 --> 08:25.298
Oh...!

08:25.332 --> 08:27.200
So, what should we practice:

08:27.234 --> 08:28.801
um, Vienna sausage;

08:28.836 --> 08:31.204
blueberry pie, short form;

08:31.238 --> 08:33.206
oatmeal, long course;

08:33.240 --> 08:36.576
freestyle baked beans;
catfish-- ooh!

08:36.610 --> 08:37.577
Cow brains.

08:37.611 --> 08:38.578
Beans, beans!

08:38.611 --> 08:39.879
We'll do beans.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.717
Hmm. Never saw the pork
eat the beans before.

08:47.254 --> 08:51.791
Actually, I'm a little surprised
Lisa likes him.

08:51.825 --> 08:53.092
Really!

08:53.127 --> 08:54.327
Justin Blobber over there

08:54.361 --> 08:56.396
doesn't remind
you of anyone?

08:56.430 --> 08:59.565
$800 to cut me out
of that slide?!

08:59.600 --> 09:02.402
It's all about the money
with those firemen.

09:02.436 --> 09:05.138
Women marry
their fathers, Marge.

09:05.172 --> 09:08.408
So you just might be meeting
your future "ton-in-law."

09:10.110 --> 09:11.978
Ton-in-law.

09:12.012 --> 09:13.813
God bless us.

09:13.847 --> 09:16.416
You can do better.

09:25.350 --> 09:27.616
<i>My sisters are nuts.</i>

09:27.754 --> 09:29.855
<i>I'm happy being married</i>
<i>to Homer.</i>

09:29.889 --> 09:32.491
<i>Most of the time.</i>

09:39.766 --> 09:41.400
Ooh! What the...?

10:07.494 --> 10:08.594
Meep, meep!

10:17.504 --> 10:20.406
Hmm...

10:20.440 --> 10:23.909
Maybe you're not cut out
for competitive eating.

10:23.943 --> 10:25.911
Are you calling me not fat?

10:25.945 --> 10:27.913
No, I'm just... I...

10:27.947 --> 10:30.582
Maybe you just haven't
found the right food, huh?

10:30.617 --> 10:32.184
How 'bout ice cream?

10:32.218 --> 10:33.252
Yes!

10:33.286 --> 10:35.621
I will lay some hurt
on that cream.

10:35.655 --> 10:38.190
Oh, my God! Brain freeze!

10:38.224 --> 10:39.958
Oh, my God.

10:39.993 --> 10:41.994
Kick me in the head
till I pass out.

10:43.797 --> 10:45.531
Harder! I'm still conscious!

10:45.565 --> 10:47.232
You must kick me harder.

10:52.672 --> 10:56.008
Okay, honey, I made you pork
chops just like you like 'em.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.843
Twenty.
Thanks, babe.

10:57.877 --> 11:01.213
Sorry you had to drop out of
college to feed me full-time.

11:01.247 --> 11:02.781
Now give us a kiss.

11:11.991 --> 11:12.991
What the...?

11:14.661 --> 11:16.628
Oh, yawn.

11:16.663 --> 11:17.729
Another freebie.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.398
Better be a 64 gig.

11:20.533 --> 11:22.401
Huh? It's full of lame apps:

11:22.435 --> 11:25.504
Bully Avoider,
Nosebook, Insta-Grandma.

11:25.538 --> 11:28.006
This was stolen from Milhouse!

11:28.041 --> 11:29.608
From my backpack.

11:29.642 --> 11:31.844
Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps.

11:31.878 --> 11:34.913
Maybe it's time to tell me
exactly what's going on.

11:34.948 --> 11:36.248
Relax.

11:36.282 --> 11:39.218
Listen to the music
of this bubble game.

11:42.455 --> 11:45.390
So peaceful.

11:45.425 --> 11:47.359
No! I won't let this go!

11:47.393 --> 11:50.229
It's time you told me how you've
been getting all this stuff.

11:51.764 --> 11:55.133
I helped Snake out of a jam so
he paid me back in stolen stuff.

11:55.168 --> 11:57.135
It was an honorable arrangement.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.238
But I never thought
he'd steal from you.

11:59.272 --> 12:00.973
Snake, eh?

12:01.007 --> 12:02.641
I never would've suspected

12:02.675 --> 12:06.078
the one criminal in town.

12:07.981 --> 12:09.848
You seem stressed.

12:09.883 --> 12:11.123
You want to suck some Squishee?

12:11.150 --> 12:12.818
Sure.

12:12.852 --> 12:13.819
Mmm!

12:13.853 --> 12:14.820
Careful.

12:14.854 --> 12:16.054
It's uncut syrup.

12:16.089 --> 12:17.723
They give it to horses
before they race.

12:24.597 --> 12:26.999
Jailbird, A Snake.

12:27.033 --> 12:28.100
That's his real name.

12:28.134 --> 12:29.868
Albert Knickerbocker
Aloysius Snake--

12:29.903 --> 12:32.170
has been arrested for a series
of thefts and may be

12:32.205 --> 12:34.740
put to death under
a controversial new statute.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.376
Yeah, we had
a law stating

12:37.410 --> 12:39.177
"Three strikes
and you're out."

12:39.212 --> 12:41.613
But I thought it
was "You're out."

12:41.648 --> 12:43.015
So I let people go.

12:43.049 --> 12:46.485
So now it's
"Four balls and you walk.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.787
Right to the
electric chair."

12:48.821 --> 12:50.856
It's, uh, much
clearer, Kent.

12:50.890 --> 12:52.824
Bart, I'm so sorry.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.961
I just wanted to ruin
his life, not end it.

12:55.995 --> 12:57.462
You ratted him out?

12:57.497 --> 12:59.264
He's got a kid.

12:59.299 --> 13:00.432
A kid?!

13:00.466 --> 13:02.801
I was crushed
when I lost my dad

13:02.835 --> 13:05.537
and all he did was move
to the Holiday Inn.

13:05.572 --> 13:07.272
I can still see him smoking

13:07.307 --> 13:09.408
<i>on the balcony.</i>

13:09.442 --> 13:11.543
<i>He looked like</i>
<i>he missed something.</i>

13:11.578 --> 13:13.545
Maybe me.

13:13.580 --> 13:16.181
So you see,
we can't let Jailbird fry.

13:16.215 --> 13:18.984
Time for the
Sleepover Detectives.

13:19.018 --> 13:20.519
I didn't say
there'd be a sleepover.

13:20.553 --> 13:23.789
Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing
my pajamas under my clothes.

13:23.823 --> 13:25.857
And my swimsuit
under those.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.493
One day it'll all pay off.

13:29.929 --> 13:33.565
Oh! There's my magazine.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.733
Why, look at this.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.769
"What every father should do
for his daughter."

13:37.804 --> 13:40.939
Oh, Marge, if you want me
to do something, just tell me.

13:40.974 --> 13:42.374
Don't hide behind a magazine.

13:42.408 --> 13:45.711
Right. Right, right, right.
According to Judy Kleinsmith,

13:45.745 --> 13:47.813
a professional freelance writer,

13:47.847 --> 13:50.215
fathers should take
their daughters out on little

13:50.249 --> 13:53.652
dinner dates and treat them
like a gentleman would.

13:53.686 --> 13:57.456
Then she'll expect the same
from the men in her future.

13:57.490 --> 13:58.991
Wait, let me
get this straight:

13:59.025 --> 14:01.994
Sit <i>and</i> eat?
That's my punishment?

14:02.028 --> 14:03.695
It's not a punishment.

14:03.730 --> 14:05.897
But you can't just eat dinner.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.267
You have to be gentlemanly
and attentive.

14:09.302 --> 14:11.103
Oh, I can fake attentive.

14:11.137 --> 14:13.805
I've been watching a football
game this whole discussion.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.607
Not fake attentive.

14:15.642 --> 14:17.175
Real attentive.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.211
Okay, okay.
I'll make it fun.

14:19.245 --> 14:21.380
I'll take her
to that crab place.

14:21.414 --> 14:23.482
All the crabs
you could smash.

14:23.516 --> 14:25.817
You know Lisa's
a vegetarian.

14:25.852 --> 14:27.285
She can smash a salad.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.023
No. Homer, you can't just do
the things you want to do.

14:31.057 --> 14:34.860
You have to act like someone
you'd want Lisa to marry.

14:34.894 --> 14:37.863
If you just act like yourself,
she might just...

14:37.897 --> 14:39.131
um...

14:39.165 --> 14:41.566
Oh, you know... um...

14:41.601 --> 14:43.435
She might marry
someone like me?

14:44.504 --> 14:46.705
You think that would be bad.

14:46.739 --> 14:48.340
Homie, I love you.

14:48.374 --> 14:50.142
But you can be
a challenge,

14:50.176 --> 14:52.377
like doing the
Daily Jumble.

14:52.412 --> 14:54.980
Marge, you are comparing me

14:55.014 --> 14:58.150
to the most infuriating thing
in the newspaper!

14:58.184 --> 14:59.651
Well, I was
just trying to...

14:59.686 --> 15:01.219
Oh...
I'm sleeping on

15:01.254 --> 15:02.988
Flanders' couch tonight.

15:03.022 --> 15:04.623
Ours is crap.

15:08.771 --> 15:12.495
So Marge says I gotta
ask Lisa on a date.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.864
Sure you remember how
to ask out a girl, Homer?

15:14.899 --> 15:17.467
Yeah, you've been out of
the game a long time there.

15:17.501 --> 15:18.735
Guys, lay off Homer.

15:18.769 --> 15:20.136
Now you quit stalling

15:20.170 --> 15:21.571
and call your
daughter like a man.

15:21.605 --> 15:23.940
Oh... it feels weird.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.875
Just ask your daughter
to have dinner with you.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.011
What is the big deal?

15:28.045 --> 15:29.012
Ah, he's doing it!

15:29.046 --> 15:30.346
He's calling a girl.

15:30.381 --> 15:31.881
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God...

15:31.916 --> 15:32.982
Oh, it's ringing.

15:33.017 --> 15:34.484
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:34.518 --> 15:35.485
Hello?

15:35.519 --> 15:37.487
Uh, hello. Lisa?

15:37.521 --> 15:38.655
I know your brother and...

15:38.689 --> 15:39.656
Oh!

15:39.690 --> 15:40.990
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

15:41.025 --> 15:42.492
Calm down, calm down.

15:42.526 --> 15:43.493
She doesn't know it's you.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.728
Ah! Hide! Hide!

15:47.364 --> 15:48.831
Uh, hello?

15:48.866 --> 15:51.367
Oh, sure, Lisa, uh,
your dad's right here.

15:53.771 --> 15:54.737
Dad?

15:54.772 --> 15:55.738
Did you just call?

15:55.773 --> 15:56.739
Uh, yeah.

15:56.774 --> 15:58.541
Hey, listen, your mom thinks

15:58.575 --> 16:00.510
that maybe you and I

16:00.544 --> 16:03.179
should have dinner together
sometime.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.580
Just the two of us?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.582
Ah, yeah, I knew
you'd think it's dumb.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.617
I'd love that.

16:07.651 --> 16:09.018
See you tonight.

16:10.054 --> 16:11.354
I got a date
with my daughter!

16:11.388 --> 16:13.222
Yeah, we all
been there.

16:13.257 --> 16:14.958
No need to act
like you just

16:14.992 --> 16:16.259
invented air conditioning.

16:19.463 --> 16:21.264
So, you see, Chief,

16:21.298 --> 16:23.800
Snake wasn't stealing
that stuff out of greed.

16:23.834 --> 16:26.269
He was stealing it
to thank me.

16:26.303 --> 16:27.603
Plea denied.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.772
Warm up the electric
chair, Lou.

16:29.807 --> 16:32.275
You're not done yet?

16:32.309 --> 16:33.943
The instructions
are in Swedish, Chief.

16:33.978 --> 16:35.878
We got this from IKILLYA.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.780
Yo, I totally
speak Swedish.

16:37.815 --> 16:38.781
Fluently?

16:38.816 --> 16:40.416
Um, <i>ja.</i>

16:40.451 --> 16:41.784
Uh, do what he says, Lou.

16:41.819 --> 16:43.686
But Chief...
But-but-but.

16:43.721 --> 16:46.556
Quit arguing and give
him the little wrench.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.557
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.025
Let him out, Lou.
Let him out.

16:49.059 --> 16:51.527
But Chief, we got guns;
he's got a little wrench.

16:51.562 --> 16:52.762
It's cold!

16:52.796 --> 16:54.430
Y... oh...

16:54.465 --> 16:56.766
All right.

16:59.103 --> 17:00.770
Thanks for coming down, Bart.

17:00.804 --> 17:03.439
You won't need
to save me a third time.

17:03.474 --> 17:04.540
You're going straight?

17:04.575 --> 17:07.377
If I get caught,
it's suicide by cop.

17:07.411 --> 17:09.078
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

17:09.113 --> 17:11.280
It means I get you
to shoot me, dude.

17:11.315 --> 17:13.782
Yeah, still sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.987
Hair volumizer?!

17:18.021 --> 17:19.222
Cologne?!

17:19.256 --> 17:21.691
Hello, Marjorie.

17:21.724 --> 17:22.925
Homie.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.926
You look like
an NBA coach.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.896
Yes, well, it's
a special evening

17:26.930 --> 17:29.966
and I thought it best
not to look like a monkey.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.467
Mm!

17:31.502 --> 17:32.802
Don't worry.

17:32.836 --> 17:34.537
I won't embarrass you.

17:34.571 --> 17:36.539
I will put
my napkin in my lap,

17:36.573 --> 17:38.708
I will use the utensils
provided for me,

17:38.742 --> 17:40.610
and if I our food
is slow in coming,

17:40.644 --> 17:43.012
I will "blow my stack"
in a manner

17:43.047 --> 17:45.815
befitting the Earl
of Yarborough.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.984
All right,
you've made your point.

17:48.018 --> 17:49.719
Hey, I can't screw this up

17:49.753 --> 17:52.822
or Lisa will get stuck
with someone like me.

17:52.856 --> 17:56.292
Homie, I don't have
a problem with you.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.295
Except your buttons
are off one.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.531
Actually, this is
a collar button, see?

18:01.565 --> 18:02.965
It goes like this...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.601
Tuh! Is there no end
to your fault-finding?

18:07.071 --> 18:08.771
Maggie, help me
with this shirt.

18:11.542 --> 18:13.810
So Mr. Burns
never realized

18:13.844 --> 18:16.245
it was Maggie
who saved the plant?

18:16.280 --> 18:17.246
Nope.

18:17.281 --> 18:18.581
Now, how's that drink?

18:18.615 --> 18:20.116
Can I Temple up
that Shirley?

18:20.150 --> 18:21.818
Oh, I'm fine.

18:23.287 --> 18:24.587
Well, have we decided?

18:24.621 --> 18:26.189
Uh, yeah, help me out here.

18:26.223 --> 18:27.690
What is the normal amount

18:27.724 --> 18:29.058
of entrees per person?

18:29.093 --> 18:30.760
Eh, one, sir.

18:30.794 --> 18:32.228
I mean for adults.

18:32.262 --> 18:33.262
One.

18:33.297 --> 18:35.865
No, I mean for
adult males.

18:35.899 --> 18:38.034
Yes.
I repeat, eh, one.

18:38.068 --> 18:40.503
All right,
I'll have the lasagna.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.504
All right.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.839
Meat or vegetarian?

18:42.873 --> 18:44.674
Oh, uh... Oh...

18:44.708 --> 18:45.942
Vegetarian.

18:45.976 --> 18:49.345
Can the red
sauce be cow blood?

18:49.379 --> 18:51.514
We'll see what
we can do.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.949
Is that Mom?

18:52.983 --> 18:55.785
Homer, can you come
with me for a minute?

18:55.819 --> 18:57.587
Marge, please,
control your jealousy.

18:57.621 --> 18:59.188
This is your daughter.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.190
We need to have
a conversation

19:01.225 --> 19:02.792
in loud whispers.

19:02.826 --> 19:04.393
Uh, excuse me, Lisa.

19:04.428 --> 19:06.963
A friend from high school.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.233
Homie, I felt terrible

19:10.267 --> 19:12.368
when you said I felt
stuck with you.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.870
But then I realized:

19:13.904 --> 19:15.972
I <i>am</i> stuck with you.

19:16.006 --> 19:18.708
I couldn't stop loving you
if I tried.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.711
I'm sorry, that's all very nice.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.713
But I can't forget
what you said.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.014
I know, Homie.

19:25.048 --> 19:26.582
I know you well
enough to know

19:26.617 --> 19:28.551
you're not ready
to forgive me yet.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.686
But I also know
you well enough

19:30.721 --> 19:33.856
to know that
this will work.

19:33.891 --> 19:35.358
Where'd you get
that dress?

19:36.927 --> 19:38.628
Remember that
sewing machine

19:38.662 --> 19:40.229
you say I
never use?

19:40.264 --> 19:43.466
Well, I sold it and
bought this dress.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.467
Wow...

19:44.501 --> 19:46.469
Wow, that looks just like

19:46.503 --> 19:48.538
the dress you wore
on <i>Project Runway.</i>

19:48.572 --> 19:49.805
Shush-shush-shush.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.907
Oh, right.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.575
I mean, this looks like a dress

19:52.609 --> 19:54.310
from a local Springfield store.

19:54.344 --> 19:55.811
All is forgiven.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.380
Let's have dinner.

20:01.885 --> 20:04.554
Dad, I believe
<i>we</i> were on a date?

20:04.588 --> 20:06.989
Oh, of course.
You're right, honey.

20:07.024 --> 20:09.659
I'll just, um...
I'll park it at the bar.

20:11.528 --> 20:14.230
Well, hello.

20:14.264 --> 20:17.333
And your lasagna
with cow blood, sir.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.501
Thanks, Frenchy.

20:18.535 --> 20:20.903
I'm not French,
I'm just pissy.

20:24.944 --> 20:25.944
Lucas.

20:25.979 --> 20:28.026
You're not competitive
eating anymore?

20:28.027 --> 20:29.194
No.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.929
I realized that
was unrealistic.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.264
Well, that's a relief.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.933
My new goal is to become
whatever Adele is.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.436
Just call me Pound-Uca-Dollar.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.738
What if I just taught
you how to whistle?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.039
You know how to whistle?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.274
Like with your mouth?

20:45.297 --> 20:46.564
Hey, I'm doing it!

20:49.907 --> 20:51.392
<i>I sound just like a bird!</i>
