00:41.029 --> 00:42.730
Well, now that my suit is hung,

00:42.764 --> 00:45.666
it's time for me to show you
something else that's...

00:45.700 --> 00:48.535
well, not-not hung
but super wide.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.672
An 18-wheeler!
I made it at work.

00:51.706 --> 00:53.874
And now sex time.

00:53.908 --> 00:56.076
Slow down. I want
to finish the story

00:56.111 --> 00:57.578
I was telling you at dinner.

00:57.612 --> 00:58.846
Oh, great.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.181
Where'd I leave off? Oh, yeah.

01:01.216 --> 01:03.951
So, I saw Sandra
at the market today.

01:03.985 --> 01:06.887
She's still having a tough time
dealing with little Jason.

01:06.921 --> 01:09.256
I guess he took a
blender to school and...

I'm here!
Okay, let's do this.

01:37.252 --> 01:38.886
Stan!
What?

01:38.920 --> 01:40.220
You want to start individually

01:40.255 --> 01:42.089
and then join forces
for the big finale?

01:42.123 --> 01:44.892
No. I'm tired of you
pretending to listen to me

01:44.926 --> 01:46.560
just so you can pound this.

01:46.594 --> 01:48.195
It's disrespectful.

01:48.229 --> 01:49.496
What? I was listening.

01:49.531 --> 01:50.664
Oh, really?

01:50.699 --> 01:53.167
Then you won't mind
taking this pop quiz

01:53.201 --> 01:55.035
about everything I said today.

01:55.070 --> 01:57.771
The gender of Denise's
new baby?

01:57.806 --> 02:00.040
The ethnicity
of your friend Tuvok?

02:00.075 --> 02:02.776
Your maiden name?
These questions are impossible!

02:02.811 --> 02:06.380
Impossible to answer
right now, because...

02:06.414 --> 02:09.049
My stomach!
It hurts so bad!

02:09.084 --> 02:10.217
Oh, brother.

02:10.251 --> 02:12.553
How dare you!
It could be my appendix!

02:12.587 --> 02:16.357
Oh. Well, then you'll need
an ambulance, won't you?

02:27.635 --> 02:29.603
I'm beat.

02:29.637 --> 02:31.772
You know, you tell yourself
you're gonna get this job

02:31.806 --> 02:34.775
at Hearty's and it's gonna
be this great thing, but...

02:34.809 --> 02:35.976
it's not.

02:36.010 --> 02:37.478
So why don't you quit?

02:37.512 --> 02:40.280
I'd love to, but I only
have $1,200 saved.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.950
H-Hold up. $1,200?

02:42.984 --> 02:45.119
Klaus, you <i>can</i> quit your job!

02:45.153 --> 02:48.455
We'll use that money to start a
business and be our own bosses!

02:48.490 --> 02:49.990
I don't know.

02:50.024 --> 02:51.225
What's the business?

02:51.259 --> 02:53.260
Roger and Klaus's Business.

02:53.294 --> 02:54.695
I love it!

02:54.729 --> 02:57.631
Right? I'm thinking we offer
a service or a product

02:57.665 --> 02:59.466
that customers will pay for.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.135
Shh!
Keep your voice down.

03:01.169 --> 03:02.669
People will hear.

03:05.206 --> 03:08.075
Thing is, I already had my
appendix out when I was a kid.

03:08.109 --> 03:09.543
Then what did they remove?

03:09.577 --> 03:11.211
Some red thing--
I didn't recognize it.

03:11.246 --> 03:13.380
But how could Francine tell
you weren't listening?

03:13.415 --> 03:15.215
Didn't you smile while
she was speaking?

03:15.250 --> 03:16.283
Of course.

03:16.317 --> 03:18.185
Did you remember also to nod?

03:18.219 --> 03:19.253
Uh, yeah.

03:19.287 --> 03:20.654
Then that's all you can do.

03:20.688 --> 03:22.723
There's no third
thing to listening.

03:22.757 --> 03:26.393
I suppose, but I'd still like
to have sex sometime this year.

03:26.428 --> 03:28.061
She's withholding sex?

03:28.096 --> 03:30.230
Why didn't you say something?

03:30.265 --> 03:31.765
Pharmacology Department?

03:31.800 --> 03:34.768
Send up a bottle of
Estrocillin right away!

03:34.803 --> 03:36.437
What's Estrocillin?

03:36.471 --> 03:39.039
It's an experimental drug
the CIA has designed

03:39.073 --> 03:42.876
to enable male agents to listen
to female intelligence targets

03:42.911 --> 03:45.879
and actually retain the
information they tell them.

03:45.914 --> 03:48.482
Damn it, why is this fridge
always so full?

03:48.516 --> 03:50.684
That's it. I quit!

03:50.718 --> 03:52.653
Wait, I can't quit.

03:52.687 --> 03:54.054
I've got a family.

03:54.088 --> 03:57.257
Unfortunately, I've already
accepted your resignation.

03:58.259 --> 03:59.726
Ah, Trish. There you are.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.695
Here's the Estrocillin
you requested, sir.

04:01.729 --> 04:02.996
Here you go, Smith.

04:03.031 --> 04:04.865
Take these,
and in no time you'll be

04:04.899 --> 04:06.533
connecting with your wife
all night long.

04:06.568 --> 04:07.935
Gentlemen,

04:07.969 --> 04:10.604
this is the perfect opportunity,
while I have you both here.

04:10.638 --> 04:12.272
I wanted to let
you know that...

04:13.575 --> 04:15.142
What do you hear, sir?

04:15.176 --> 04:17.010
Is it the hum of an AC unit?

04:17.045 --> 04:18.846
Actually, mine's whales.

04:31.993 --> 04:34.828
Well, we've spent all the money,
but we have our location.

04:34.863 --> 04:37.564
Wow. So much potential.
Right?

04:37.599 --> 04:39.766
All that's left is to figure out
what we're gonna sell,

04:39.801 --> 04:41.702
where we're gonna get it
and how to run

04:41.736 --> 04:43.470
and properly manage
a successful business.

04:43.505 --> 04:46.306
The finishing touches.

05:03.324 --> 05:05.459
Uh, uh, wait, wait, Francine,
uh, don't go to sleep.

05:05.493 --> 05:07.628
I never got to ask you
how your day was.

05:07.662 --> 05:09.062
Very funny, Stan.

05:09.097 --> 05:10.797
No, seriously.
I want to know.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.200
How was your day?

05:13.234 --> 05:14.868
Well...

05:14.903 --> 05:17.004
I just wasn't feeling it.

05:17.038 --> 05:18.672
You know what I mean?
I don't.

05:18.706 --> 05:20.607
But I want to.

05:20.642 --> 05:22.075
Elaborate.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.760
...then she told her
that she'd never said that

05:39.794 --> 05:42.763
to either of them in the first
place, least of all her.

05:42.797 --> 05:45.098
Not to her, certainly.
Oh, and, Francine,

05:45.133 --> 05:47.301
I'm ready to take
your listening test.

05:47.335 --> 05:49.836
Stan, there's no
time for a test.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.772
I want you immediately.

05:51.806 --> 05:53.040
And I, you.

05:53.074 --> 05:54.441
But first I got to pee.

05:56.277 --> 05:58.445
My insides are squirming
like eels.

05:58.479 --> 06:00.113
What are you doing to me, girl?

06:00.148 --> 06:02.950
Oh, Stan. Pee fast.

06:05.787 --> 06:07.254
Bathroom phone.

06:07.288 --> 06:10.090
Smith! Tell me you
haven't taken the Estrocillin!

06:10.124 --> 06:11.625
Why? What's the prob...

06:35.316 --> 06:36.950
Oh, my God, sir!

06:36.985 --> 06:39.953
Either I've gone crazy,
or I've turned into a woman!

06:39.988 --> 06:41.088
What's the difference?

06:43.458 --> 06:45.225
Hey, screw you!

06:49.282 --> 06:53.018
Stan, get out here
and ravage me.

07:05.498 --> 07:08.734
I have a headache
from all that screaming.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.235
Well, not to compete with you,

07:10.269 --> 07:12.269
but I have a headache
from my skull changing shape.

07:12.317 --> 07:14.639
How did this happen?
I don't know.

07:14.674 --> 07:17.485
All I did was take this pill,
but the woman at the lab said

07:17.562 --> 07:20.464
nothing about recommended dosage
or possible side effects.

07:20.499 --> 07:23.400
It's imperative that you
only take half a pill.

07:23.435 --> 07:27.138
A whole pill will
transform you into a woman.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.975
You know what? I'm gonna
start making them smaller.

07:31.009 --> 07:34.311
"Increases comprehension
of female chatter."

07:34.346 --> 07:37.248
So this is why you were
listening so well.

07:37.282 --> 07:40.117
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to be a better husband.

07:40.152 --> 07:41.719
Don't I get points for effort?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.388
Yeah, I guess.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.157
Don't worry.

07:46.191 --> 07:47.458
We'll figure this out.

07:47.492 --> 07:51.195
Are... are your boobs
bigger than mine?

07:51.229 --> 07:52.930
Just different, is all.

07:52.964 --> 07:54.999
In size.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.370
So what's with
the family meeting?

08:00.405 --> 08:02.106
What the hell? Dad?

08:02.140 --> 08:03.774
Kind of.

08:03.808 --> 08:06.644
Kids, your father's...

08:06.678 --> 08:08.179
a woman now.

08:08.213 --> 08:11.782
We all need to process this
as a family,

08:11.816 --> 08:15.186
so if you have any questions,
let's hear them.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.420
I-I don't understand.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.755
That's not a question, Hayley.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.623
And you don't have to
raise your hand, Steve.

08:19.658 --> 08:21.125
How are you a woman now?

08:21.159 --> 08:23.727
In every way. From my
ridiculous split ends

08:23.762 --> 08:25.596
to these boots I'm
already sick of.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.131
Wait, so d-does
this mean...

08:27.165 --> 08:28.599
Steve had his hand raised.
Steve.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.135
So, like, are you
gonna wear a bra now?

08:31.169 --> 08:33.470
Absolutely not. Everyone knows
if they're flawless,

08:33.505 --> 08:35.371
you can go braless.
Next question.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.107
Will you...
Oh, Steve beat you by a hair.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.109
Are trains becoming obsolete?

08:39.144 --> 08:40.443
On the contrary, Steve.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.046
Trains are more relevant
than ever.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.280
Now Hayley.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.683
A-Am I the only one
struggling with this here?

08:45.717 --> 08:47.551
You found a book, right, Stan?

08:47.586 --> 08:49.687
They didn't have one
where a dad becomes a mom,

08:49.721 --> 08:52.189
so maybe read it backwards.

08:52.224 --> 08:54.858
How does it work
with-with you guys then?

08:54.893 --> 08:56.527
Are you still together?

08:56.561 --> 08:59.964
Yes. We love each other very much.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.367
So... you're lesbians now?

09:03.401 --> 09:06.503
I... I don't know.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.975
Hey! I figured out what we're
gonna sell for our business.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.443
Stan's suits!

09:12.477 --> 09:14.778
He's got hundreds of them
that he doesn't need anymore.

09:14.813 --> 09:17.114
Is he dead?
Is he finally dead?

09:17.148 --> 09:18.315
Can I go free?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.717
No, he's a woman now.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.685
Oh.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.355
A woman fish?

09:26.891 --> 09:29.526
So... lesbians?

09:29.561 --> 09:30.928
Lesbians.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.935
Don't-don't do that.

09:37.969 --> 09:39.470
I-I don't feel
confident there.

09:39.504 --> 09:40.471
Let me do this.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.108
Hey. Ow, ow.

09:44.142 --> 09:46.310
Stan, what are you doing?

09:46.344 --> 09:49.713
I don't know, but it feels like
we're trying to make a fire.

09:49.748 --> 09:50.848
This isn't working.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.117
Well, until the CIA fixes you,

09:53.151 --> 09:55.185
I guess sex is off the table.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.321
'Cause we are not lesbians.

09:57.355 --> 09:58.789
We should tell the kids.

09:58.823 --> 10:00.824
Kids, we are not lesbians!

10:00.859 --> 10:02.626
We tried, but it was a no go!

10:02.661 --> 10:04.728
Please stop
involving me in this!

10:04.763 --> 10:06.797
I am a child!

10:09.334 --> 10:11.168
Agent Smith reporting for duty.

10:11.202 --> 10:14.038
Come in. Let me
get a look at you.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.441
Do a quick turn for us.

10:17.475 --> 10:20.577
You really do cut quite
a figure as a woman, Smith.

10:20.612 --> 10:23.280
You look exactly as I imagined.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.785
Only I drew the
hair a bit short.

10:27.819 --> 10:29.820
Well, that's easily fixed.

10:30.822 --> 10:31.955
There it is.

10:31.990 --> 10:34.825
Any news from the lab on
reversing... all this?

10:34.859 --> 10:37.027
Not yet,
but I'll keep you posted.

10:37.062 --> 10:39.263
Now off to work with you.

10:44.135 --> 10:45.602
Go for Bullock.

10:45.637 --> 10:47.671
Sir, we've successfully
engineered a way

10:47.706 --> 10:49.406
to reverse the effects
of Estrocillin.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.008
Oh, that's exciting.

10:51.042 --> 10:53.477
Shall I notify Agent Smith?
I'll do it.

10:53.511 --> 10:56.280
We have a thing where he
likes to hear things from me.

10:56.314 --> 10:57.481
It's a thing.

10:57.515 --> 10:58.849
We have it.

11:01.052 --> 11:03.020
This fridge is always full.

11:03.054 --> 11:04.455
We need a second one.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.690
That way, we could
have one for drinks

11:06.725 --> 11:09.026
and the other one
for people's bag lunches.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.728
Hmm, not a bad idea.

11:10.762 --> 11:13.097
I think I should go to
the deputy director with this.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.732
Are you done having your idea?

11:14.766 --> 11:16.967
Can I get the Sriracha now?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.871
Thanks for taking me out.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.406
I really needed this.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.908
The girls at work have been
really rough on me.

11:24.943 --> 11:26.343
No respect.

11:26.378 --> 11:28.545
I'm like the Rodney Dangerfield
of that office

11:28.580 --> 11:30.681
because I basically
am dead to them.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.685
Excuse me, are you Megan Fox?

11:34.719 --> 11:35.886
No.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.922
So you're just a regular fox.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.428
Stan, as a woman
with an unnecessarily large

11:44.462 --> 11:47.464
and perky bosom, you're
gonna get lots of attention.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.666
Guys will say anything
to try and pick you up,

11:49.701 --> 11:51.435
and some of it's
gonna be tempting.

11:51.469 --> 11:53.303
So I don't look like Megan Fox?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.806
I know it's all new
and confusing.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.508
Just be careful.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.878
Hopefully, you won't
have to be a woman much longer.

12:00.912 --> 12:02.880
I'll get us another round.

12:02.914 --> 12:05.716
At The K&R Suit Experience,
we have hundreds of suits,

12:05.750 --> 12:08.385
in the only color
you'll ever need.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.721
<i>Blue, blue, this shade of blue!</i>

12:10.755 --> 12:12.756
All suits in stock
are 42 regular.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.591
Smaller than that?
Get it tailored.

12:14.626 --> 12:16.527
There are tailors
all over the city.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.429
Open a phone book.

12:18.463 --> 12:20.197
Are you bigger than 42 regular?

12:20.231 --> 12:21.265
We can't help you.

12:21.299 --> 12:22.533
Look elsewhere!

12:22.567 --> 12:25.402
These prices are so low,
they're driving us mad.

12:25.437 --> 12:26.937
Why are we burning these suits?

12:26.971 --> 12:27.871
For warmth?

12:27.906 --> 12:30.407
My grip on reality
is weakening!

12:30.442 --> 12:33.577
Must... lower... prices.

12:33.611 --> 12:35.579
<i>K&R Suit Experience</i>
<i>in Little Detroit.</i>

12:35.613 --> 12:36.814
Next to the abandoned
police station.

12:36.848 --> 12:38.882
If you see "God is Dead"
written on the side

12:38.917 --> 12:41.285
of the collapsing overpass,
then you've gone too far!

12:44.289 --> 12:45.756
What do I owe you?

12:45.790 --> 12:47.524
Your drinks have
been paid for, miss.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.959
Shut up.

12:48.993 --> 12:50.160
Deputy Director Bullock.

12:50.195 --> 12:51.295
What are you doing here?

12:51.329 --> 12:52.563
Is there news from the lab?

12:52.597 --> 12:54.565
Yes, and I'm afraid
it isn't good.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.200
There's no cure for this.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.069
You'll be a beautiful
woman forever.

12:59.103 --> 13:00.437
Oh, my God.

13:00.472 --> 13:02.906
No time for an honest
emotional response.

13:02.941 --> 13:06.109
We also have urgent CIA
business to attend to.

13:06.144 --> 13:07.845
Oh, uh, let me just
tell Francine.

13:07.879 --> 13:10.180
As I said, no time.
Now let's go.

13:10.215 --> 13:13.217
Yes, sir. I'll grab my pashmina
and meet you out front.

13:15.153 --> 13:17.120
See that woman over there?

13:17.155 --> 13:18.422
I'm going to rail her.

13:18.456 --> 13:20.424
Oh! We got one!

13:20.458 --> 13:22.392
♪ You say
you're gonna rail her ♪

13:22.427 --> 13:23.927
♪ We're really glad to hear

13:23.962 --> 13:25.295
♪ And after you've completed

13:25.330 --> 13:27.498
♪ She'll be grinning
ear to ear, hey! ♪

13:27.532 --> 13:30.534
I love the family
atmosphere here.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.917
Have you seen my husband?

13:36.037 --> 13:38.060
Six foot tall?
Dark hair?

13:38.278 --> 13:39.479
Body of a woman?

13:39.513 --> 13:40.780
Oh, that lady.

13:40.814 --> 13:43.182
She left about 20 minutes ago
with some guy.

13:43.217 --> 13:45.651
What? Do you remember
anything about him?

13:45.686 --> 13:48.454
Not much. Only that he was bald,
worked for the CIA,

13:48.489 --> 13:50.189
and sounded like The Beatles.

13:50.224 --> 13:52.592
Not when they sing,
but when they do interviews.

13:52.626 --> 13:53.326
Bullock!

13:58.065 --> 13:59.499
So, what's the urgent business?

13:59.533 --> 14:02.502
Oh, that. Uh,
yes, well, um...

14:03.704 --> 14:05.071
Ah. Mission cancelled.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.840
Looks like another gumshoe
found Carmen Sandiego for us.

14:07.875 --> 14:08.975
Well, that <i>is</i> good news.

14:09.009 --> 14:11.277
I guess you can
take me back to the bar.

14:11.311 --> 14:14.213
Or we could just keep driving.

14:14.248 --> 14:16.449
It's rare that I
get one-on-one time

14:16.483 --> 14:17.817
with my employees.

14:17.851 --> 14:20.586
Actually, I <i>was</i> hoping
to talk to you about a solution

14:20.621 --> 14:22.488
to the break room
fridge problem that,

14:22.523 --> 14:24.423
frankly, I'm pretty
excited about.

14:27.628 --> 14:30.496
You ever see one
of these bad boys?

14:30.531 --> 14:33.733
Not many people get the chance
to see the moon while moving.

14:33.767 --> 14:34.934
It's...

14:38.405 --> 14:39.572
Are you okay?

14:39.606 --> 14:42.675
God, I am so sick
of that happening.

14:42.709 --> 14:46.012
But let's not let
it ruin our night.

14:46.046 --> 14:48.481
Anyway, about my idea for
the fridge in the break room...

14:48.515 --> 14:50.917
Yes, I can't wait
to discuss it.

14:50.951 --> 14:54.053
But we should probably
do it somewhere indoors.

14:54.087 --> 14:57.390
Where could we go?
Where could we go?

14:57.424 --> 15:00.159
I suppose we could
go to my place.

15:01.261 --> 15:04.096
I mean, we're already here.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.335
Not one customer all day.

15:09.369 --> 15:10.570
I mean, that dog came in,

15:10.604 --> 15:12.638
but he was just looking
for a place to die.

15:12.673 --> 15:14.674
Eh, let's get out of here.

15:18.779 --> 15:20.513
Thanks a lot, Obama.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.325
Is this the warehouse
dance party?

15:23.350 --> 15:24.350
Huh?

15:24.384 --> 15:25.751
Flyer says 50 bucks.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.186
This is the place, right?

15:28.455 --> 15:29.589
Oh, uh, yeah.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.691
Yeah, this is the
place you think it is.

15:31.725 --> 15:32.892
Head on in.

15:32.926 --> 15:34.293
Head on in.

15:34.328 --> 15:36.329
Text your friends,
tell them you found it.

15:39.366 --> 15:41.033
Stan?

15:41.068 --> 15:42.535
Stan?!

15:44.571 --> 15:46.872
Sorry to interrupt
your science,

15:46.907 --> 15:49.375
but have you seen
my husband Stan Smith?

15:49.409 --> 15:50.710
Anatomically a woman.

15:50.744 --> 15:52.311
Agent Smith is still a woman?

15:52.346 --> 15:53.779
Well, yeah.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.381
We're still waiting on a cure.

15:55.415 --> 15:56.716
There <i>is</i> a cure.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.919
A simple pill that'll
turn Stan back into a man.

15:59.953 --> 16:02.088
Bullock was
supposed to tell him.

16:02.122 --> 16:03.689
Apparently they have a thing.

16:03.724 --> 16:05.324
Wait a minute.

16:05.359 --> 16:07.660
Then Bullock's
keeping Stan a woman

16:07.694 --> 16:09.228
so he can sleep with him.

16:09.262 --> 16:11.130
I have to find out
where they are.

16:11.164 --> 16:12.865
Well, if Bullock's
trying to seal the deal,

16:12.899 --> 16:14.367
they're probably at his house.

16:14.401 --> 16:16.469
That's where he likes
to have his sex.

16:18.338 --> 16:20.006
There.
Two glasses of zin,

16:20.040 --> 16:23.009
some pickled ginger,
a bowl of clementines.

16:23.043 --> 16:25.878
The scene is set to
discuss work concerns.

16:25.912 --> 16:27.246
Well, as we both know,

16:27.280 --> 16:30.282
the situation with the fridge
has become untenable.

16:30.317 --> 16:32.718
My proposal:
a second fridge.

16:32.753 --> 16:34.320
Where would we put it, you ask?

16:34.354 --> 16:36.155
Put it where the Fruitopia
vending machine is.

16:36.156 --> 16:38.791
I mean, we can keep
waiting for the guy to come back

16:38.825 --> 16:40.926
and restock it,
but it's been 12 years.

16:40.961 --> 16:42.094
It's time to move on.

16:42.129 --> 16:43.496
Intriguing.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.131
Very intriguing.

16:45.165 --> 16:47.299
Oh, I'm so glad you're into it.

16:47.334 --> 16:48.401
Open.

16:48.435 --> 16:50.069
Yes, enjoy that, Smith.

16:50.103 --> 16:52.071
It's the last thing
you'll put in your mouth

16:52.105 --> 16:53.906
a little at a time.

16:53.940 --> 16:57.243
Come on, come on!
Get out of my way!

16:57.277 --> 16:59.278
I love what I've heard so far.

16:59.312 --> 17:00.913
You have to tell me more.

17:00.947 --> 17:03.315
Well, I'm just saying,
if we have two fridges,

17:03.350 --> 17:05.284
then we essentially
double our capacity.

17:05.318 --> 17:09.188
You know, I have
over four swords.

17:09.222 --> 17:10.256
Hai-yah!

17:11.625 --> 17:13.759
Oops.

17:27.473 --> 17:30.643
That's the exact
same car as mine.

17:32.746 --> 17:34.046
Oh, no!

17:34.081 --> 17:36.415
Do I have a man's haircut?

17:36.450 --> 17:38.751
And people don't want to put
their lunches in the door

17:38.785 --> 17:40.820
because it sometimes
squishes the sandwiches.

17:40.854 --> 17:43.723
So, Smith, now that you're
a woman permanently,

17:43.757 --> 17:47.059
you and your wife probably
won't be getting it on, eh?

17:47.094 --> 17:49.228
No, I guess not.

17:49.262 --> 17:50.629
We'll just be friends.

17:50.664 --> 17:51.664
Best friends.

17:51.698 --> 17:53.332
Seems like a best friend

17:53.366 --> 17:56.068
would want you to have
<i>all</i> your needs met.

17:56.103 --> 17:57.636
Sir, what are you saying?

17:57.671 --> 17:59.238
Look in the mirror, bro.

17:59.272 --> 18:03.209
You're a red-hot mama and your
body is crying out for a man.

18:03.243 --> 18:04.977
Let me be that man.

18:05.011 --> 18:07.580
I... I-I don't know.

18:07.614 --> 18:10.282
You're telling me you haven't
wondered what it'd be like

18:10.317 --> 18:12.985
if one of us accidentally
changed genders

18:13.019 --> 18:15.454
after a horrible
pharmacological mishap?

18:18.225 --> 18:20.192
That's what I thought.

18:20.227 --> 18:23.796
Now, what if this happened?

18:25.232 --> 18:27.600
That's... that's not so bad.

18:27.634 --> 18:28.701
You're right.

18:28.735 --> 18:30.469
It's not so bad.

18:30.504 --> 18:32.872
I bought him in Thailand.

18:32.906 --> 18:35.541
You can drown him
if it pleases you.

18:43.316 --> 18:45.618
Stan! Stan!

18:52.559 --> 18:54.560
Oh, no.

18:54.594 --> 18:59.231
♪ This is no ordinary love...

18:59.266 --> 19:00.533
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

19:00.567 --> 19:03.636
♪ No ordinary love...

19:10.110 --> 19:11.744
Still warm.

19:11.778 --> 19:13.712
I can't believe this
is about to happen.

19:13.747 --> 19:14.914
Wow.

19:14.948 --> 19:17.183
When I had my idea
about the fridge, I...

19:17.217 --> 19:19.018
I never thought it
would lead to this.

19:19.052 --> 19:20.386
Your idea about what now?

19:20.420 --> 19:21.754
The break room fridge.

19:21.788 --> 19:25.157
Oh, I hate the break room
fridge; it's always so packed.

19:25.192 --> 19:28.360
Someone's got to
do something about that.

19:28.395 --> 19:29.695
Are you kidding me?

19:31.097 --> 19:32.364
No!

19:32.399 --> 19:35.067
You've just been pretending
to listen to me all night!

19:35.101 --> 19:37.469
Do you know
how disrespectful that is?

19:39.072 --> 19:40.206
Tell me more.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.507
You're still not listening!

19:41.541 --> 19:43.509
Oh, Francine was right.

19:43.543 --> 19:46.779
If you love someone, you have to
at least try to listen to them.

19:46.813 --> 19:49.415
I finally know how to be
the man she deserves,

19:49.449 --> 19:51.851
but I'm stuck
as a woman forever.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.954
Oh, Stan.

19:54.988 --> 19:56.222
Francine?

19:56.256 --> 19:59.725
I heard everything,
and I'm so glad you understand.

19:59.759 --> 20:01.360
And you're not stuck.

20:01.394 --> 20:04.063
There's an antidote
that turns you back into a man.

20:04.097 --> 20:05.397
Well, that's great news.

20:06.266 --> 20:08.234
And he's known the whole time.

20:08.268 --> 20:09.468
Is that true?

20:12.672 --> 20:15.074
Unbelievable.

20:15.108 --> 20:17.276
I'm keeping the sword.

20:19.512 --> 20:22.414
I hope this won't
make things weird at work.

20:24.951 --> 20:25.985
Wow.

20:26.019 --> 20:27.953
Regrowing a penis was...

20:27.988 --> 20:29.788
not as painful as you'd think.

20:29.823 --> 20:31.624
I'm so glad you're back.

20:31.658 --> 20:33.559
No, hold on.

20:33.593 --> 20:34.760
Pop quiz.

20:34.794 --> 20:36.829
Who did I talk to at the CIA?

20:36.863 --> 20:38.564
Oh, uh, you talked
to the lab lady.

20:38.598 --> 20:40.599
Good. And her name?

20:40.634 --> 20:42.434
Aw, come on. Um...

20:42.469 --> 20:44.770
It starts with a letter
in the alphabet.

20:44.804 --> 20:46.540
Uh, let's see, it's...

20:46.660 --> 20:48.402
it's-it's Blowgus?

20:48.855 --> 20:50.022
The woman's name is Blowgus?

20:50.056 --> 20:52.572
You know what,
I don't remember either.
