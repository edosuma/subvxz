LANDON: How could
something that's basically

00:09.734 --> 00:11.026
a mud robot be my father?

00:11.111 --> 00:13.362
He found a way
to reproduce biologically.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.552
To have a son.

00:14.637 --> 00:16.577
I'm scared. Especially now
that you're human.

00:16.745 --> 00:17.953

- Landon...

00:18.038 --> 00:20.685
- Now that I'm not special.
- Don't put that on me.

00:28.874 --> 00:31.403

We bring back

00:40.697 --> 00:41.954

I'm sorry.

00:43.607 --> 00:44.838
NECROMANCER:
All we need now

00:44.923 --> 00:46.642
is the final piece
of the Triad spell.

00:46.727 --> 00:49.368
I assume you've secured
a vampire?

01:17.707 --> 01:20.725
Actually, um,
don't laugh,

our anniversary.

01:23.305 --> 01:24.722
The math is
admittedly complicated,

01:24.807 --> 01:26.500

the time

01:26.585 --> 01:27.954
when you were in Malivore,

01:28.039 --> 01:29.491
plus the time
that we were unwilling

to admit we had broken up

- when we pretty much had...
- Yeah, my head hurts.

01:32.406 --> 01:34.209
Yeah, see? Complicated.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.420
Mm-hmm.

I'd like to make
tonight special, too.

02:04.141 --> 02:06.485
Well, you're gonna have
to sing me that song again.

02:07.924 --> 02:10.006
Okay, not exactly
what I had in mind.

02:10.091 --> 02:11.300
What did you...?

02:13.295 --> 02:14.922
Oh, God.

02:15.867 --> 02:17.317
You mean, like,
"special" special.

02:17.402 --> 02:19.325
I mean, if

Um, one more question.

02:44.452 --> 02:47.788
Would you title this "A Day

02:47.872 --> 02:50.767
It's pretty generic,
even for a jock like me.

02:50.852 --> 02:54.156
But if I was behind on
my journalism assignment, sure.

02:54.448 --> 02:56.642
The Salvatore Scroll
thanks you.

02:57.362 --> 02:59.250
Fun fact,
I've been trying to pitch

02:59.335 --> 03:00.384
"A Day in the Life
of a Stallion"

03:00.468 --> 03:01.791
to the school paper

Um, I need

03:11.912 --> 03:13.789
Turns out all those

03:13.874 --> 03:15.343

03:19.672 --> 03:21.970
Oh, also, tell your dad
he sucks for ghosting us, too.

03:22.073 --> 03:23.591
Our new principal
is a total hard-ass.

03:23.676 --> 03:25.344
You'll probably
see him first.

03:25.429 --> 03:28.140
He and your mom

03:48.100 --> 03:51.406
Hey. What do you think
you're doing here?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.076
I'm consecrating this space.

the principal
at Mystic Falls High.

04:50.846 --> 04:52.287
He's planning
some sort of blood ritual.

Everybody at the school
is in danger.

04:54.319 --> 04:56.028
All right, go inside.
I'll handle it.

04:56.113 --> 04:58.698
- What are you gonna do? What
- I always do. Fight the battle,

04:58.783 --> 05:00.295
fix the problem,
then erase the evidence.

05:13.277 --> 05:15.080
How do we erase that?

05:20.325 --> 05:23.088
MG: Whatever you're planning,
you don't have to do this.

05:24.654 --> 05:27.094
You don't have to keep
pulling on those ropes.

05:27.314 --> 05:29.066
They're soaked in vervain.

05:29.189 --> 05:30.784
Now, hush, you.

05:30.922 --> 05:32.609
This spell's
like a zillion years old,

05:32.694 --> 05:33.662
and Ted's gonna be
even more of a bitch

05:33.747 --> 05:35.895
than usual if I screw it up.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.251
MG: You don't have to do
what The Necromancer wants.

05:40.336 --> 05:42.511
So, can you just talk to me
before you make a mistake

05:42.596 --> 05:43.972
that you're gonna regret?

05:46.084 --> 05:47.592
Fine.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.276
You got two minutes,

05:50.943 --> 05:53.431
but just because your eyes
are so dreamy.

05:53.723 --> 05:55.783
What exactly does
he want from you?

05:57.588 --> 05:59.845
Duh. I'm recreating
the original Triad spell

05:59.930 --> 06:01.472
that spawned Malivore, silly.

06:01.557 --> 06:04.309
So you're seriously
gonna raise Malivore

06:04.394 --> 06:06.082
- all over again?
- For starters.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.488
Then I'm gonna raise
all the monsters

06:07.572 --> 06:09.210
he ever consumed.

06:09.440 --> 06:13.410
The Necro is using you, Alyssa.

06:13.698 --> 06:17.246
I know you're mad at the world
and pissed at the school,

06:17.331 --> 06:19.141
but I can help you.

06:30.154 --> 06:31.455
You're right.

06:32.576 --> 06:34.090
You can.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.747
Because I need
the blood of a vampire.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.417
That's why you're here.

06:43.199 --> 06:45.425
ALARIC:
Necromancer has made his move,

06:45.510 --> 06:48.487
and the entire student body
is in that high school with him.

06:48.571 --> 06:50.614
So the question
my daughter asked me earlier

06:50.698 --> 06:52.616
is one I put to you now:

06:53.191 --> 06:54.951
What are we gonna do?

06:55.036 --> 06:57.579
(indistinct chatter)

06:57.663 --> 06:59.166
I have a plan.

07:00.249 --> 07:02.416
In the past,
I would have kept it from you.

07:03.459 --> 07:05.179
You know, I built this school
to protect you

07:05.324 --> 07:07.280
and your gifts from a world
that understands neither,

07:07.364 --> 07:09.492
but the way I see it...

07:11.595 --> 07:13.512
...you're the world's
only shot now.

07:14.247 --> 07:15.639
HOPE: All right, enough
with the speech.

07:15.723 --> 07:17.347
I'm in. Well, you haven't
even heard the plan.

07:17.431 --> 07:18.933
It ends with us winning, right?

07:19.018 --> 07:20.746
Yeah.
Where the hell is MG?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.220
KALEB: Found a note
from him this morning.

07:22.304 --> 07:24.231
He went to go help Alyssa Chang.

07:25.019 --> 07:26.023
Then I'm in, too.

07:26.108 --> 07:27.368
LANDON: Yeah.
Make that the three of us.

07:27.452 --> 07:28.902
Landon, this is gonna be
very dangerous.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.042
And given recent events...

07:30.127 --> 07:31.253
I went to that school.

07:31.430 --> 07:33.430
I mean, I'll stay out of the fight,
but I can help.

07:37.003 --> 07:38.464
Like he said, we're in.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.491
All right.

07:40.576 --> 07:42.080
Who else is with us?

07:43.622 --> 07:45.459
MG: Don't do it.
I'm begging you.

07:45.544 --> 07:47.379
Raf's blood is already in
this mud stew.

07:47.463 --> 07:49.633
So is mine. Ignore
the fine print for a second.

07:49.718 --> 07:51.015
But once I add yours,

07:51.100 --> 07:53.342
my spell's way more powerful
than the first one.

07:53.427 --> 07:56.597
It has to be, because Malivore
needs to serve Ted.

07:56.681 --> 07:58.348
- Alyssa...
- Now the fine print.

07:58.432 --> 08:01.025
That's gonna require
a bit of sacrifice.

08:01.321 --> 08:03.226
So before
you ask, yes,

08:03.311 --> 08:04.585
this spell will kill you.

08:04.670 --> 08:07.233
You'll grow weaker with
every monster that gets raised

08:07.318 --> 08:09.337
until, well, you die.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.956
But don't worry.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.577
Ted's gonna bring you
back.

08:13.155 --> 08:15.240
And he's gonna tweak
some things, too.

08:15.324 --> 08:16.950
Tweak me how?

08:17.034 --> 08:19.912
He'll make you love me
this time around, Milton.

08:21.325 --> 08:23.169
Like you should have
the first time.

08:23.919 --> 08:25.625
Alyssa, please.

08:25.824 --> 08:28.243
Don't do this.

08:34.844 --> 08:36.207
Just did.

08:36.761 --> 08:38.772
Because this is my plan.

08:41.504 --> 08:43.619
Welcome to Team Monster.

08:44.527 --> 08:45.915
No.

08:56.243 --> 08:58.742
MAC: As much as I appreciated
last night, you can't be here.

08:58.826 --> 09:00.786
Some maniac in a Halloween
costume has taken over

09:00.870 --> 09:03.622
the school, and my kids
are trapped inside.

09:04.307 --> 09:06.714
Which is why you have to do
exactly as I say.

09:06.968 --> 09:08.460
I'm sorry it has to be
this way, but it is

09:08.544 --> 09:10.444
a matter of life and death.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.739
You are aware we have guns?

09:15.824 --> 09:17.066
My team won't even know
how to use these.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.429
That's okay. Mine will.

10:00.545 --> 10:01.545
Here they come!

10:01.872 --> 10:03.766
(roars)

10:09.302 --> 10:10.720
Ric, what the hell
is happening?

10:11.429 --> 10:12.875
ALARIC:
Exactly what we wanted.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.228
That's my cue.
I got to get out of here

10:15.313 --> 10:17.565
before he sees anything
we don't want him to.

10:19.297 --> 10:21.133
HOPE: Are you sure
that this is the right way?

10:21.218 --> 10:22.200
Positive.

10:22.284 --> 10:23.771
I used to hide out down here
all the time

10:23.855 --> 10:25.954
when Connor... R.I. pieces...
Was bullying me.

10:26.039 --> 10:27.789
That door's gonna lead us
into the boiler room,

10:27.873 --> 10:29.742
which should lead us
up to the school.

10:30.115 --> 10:33.170
Uh... shouldn't have
said "us," huh?

10:33.571 --> 10:35.531
It's no wonder
I don't have a weapon.

10:35.893 --> 10:37.436
I want you to be with me,
Landon.

10:37.521 --> 10:39.636
I do. I just...
I want everything

10:39.755 --> 10:41.273
we talked about this morning
even more.

10:41.357 --> 10:43.252
I mean, I'm not saying that
you're weak; You're just human,

10:43.336 --> 10:45.824
like you were when I first
fell in love with you.

10:46.262 --> 10:48.128
I just can't risk
losing you again.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.529
I'll stay here.

10:51.646 --> 10:53.439
You go be what
you've always been:

10:53.524 --> 10:56.610
A brilliant, gorgeous,
tribrid hero.

10:57.202 --> 10:59.154
Just be back in time
for that date tonight.

11:01.023 --> 11:02.812
(thud)

11:03.074 --> 11:04.826
Barrier spell.
It's probably spelled

11:04.910 --> 11:06.666
by a dark object
I can't get through.

11:06.751 --> 11:09.006
We're gonna need Lizzie
to come and siphon it.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.011
It must be to keep
people like you out.

11:12.096 --> 11:14.664
People like me... humans...

11:14.919 --> 11:17.057
You said if it's a dark object, anyone
can take it down, right?

11:17.141 --> 11:18.345
Theoretically.
F you were to go

11:18.430 --> 11:19.663
Iinside without me,
which you are so not doing.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.107
Hope, we don't have a choice.
Deep down, you know I'm right.

11:24.345 --> 11:26.597
(sighs): Once you get inside,
you're looking for a totem

11:26.682 --> 11:29.226
that emanates black magic,
like a, uh... a bell or...

11:29.310 --> 11:30.932
- A candle. I got it.
- Once you break the spell,

11:31.016 --> 11:33.188
- please hide until I get there.
- Hey, don't worry.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.652
I'm just Obi-Wan. I'm going
to take down the tractor beam

11:35.736 --> 11:37.071
so the heroes
can save the world.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.443
He died, didn't he?

11:38.527 --> 11:39.886
Okay, first of all,
you only know that

11:39.970 --> 11:41.543
because I forced you
movies.

11:41.628 --> 11:42.902
And second, there are
two more good sequels,

11:42.986 --> 11:45.953
and I'm not gonna die
before you see them. I promise.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.203
JOSIE:
What the hell are you doing?

11:53.888 --> 11:55.558
Dad wants us
to take down Alyssa,

11:55.643 --> 11:57.662
so I need you at full strength.

11:57.962 --> 11:59.802
You know I don't
trust myself with magic.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.843
And seeing Ethan today
reminded me why.

12:01.928 --> 12:04.471
What I did to his arm. Yeah, and
now he is trapped in that school

12:04.555 --> 12:06.054
where something awful
is bound to happen.

12:06.138 --> 12:08.723
So maybe save his ass
and call it even?

12:08.807 --> 12:10.892
Lizzie, I'm not ready.

12:11.279 --> 12:12.806
Do it for me.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.901
Alyssa's on Team Monster,
remember?

12:16.134 --> 12:17.969
And MG still hasn't come back.

12:19.217 --> 12:21.236
You're pining.

12:21.433 --> 12:24.519
I'm not.
I'm just worried about him.

12:24.604 --> 12:26.692
In a super piney way.

12:26.777 --> 12:28.945
Admit it, after all this time,

12:29.030 --> 12:30.784
he's finally won you over.

12:31.469 --> 12:34.915
I suppose... it's possible

12:35.000 --> 12:37.210
that the better a person
I become,

12:37.294 --> 12:40.328
the more I feel like
not giving MG a shot

12:40.413 --> 12:43.425
wasn't about him failing
to live up to my standards.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.489
It was the other way around.

12:49.328 --> 12:51.894
I really hate
to ask you this, Jo,

12:52.450 --> 12:54.856
but I need to help him.

12:55.028 --> 12:57.337
The way that he is
always helping me.

12:57.422 --> 13:00.828
So, if recent events
have taught me anything,

13:00.913 --> 13:02.455
it's that you and I

13:02.540 --> 13:05.823
are more powerful together
than we are apart.

13:12.547 --> 13:14.142
ALYSSA: <i>I know you're
in a weakened condition</i>

13:14.226 --> 13:15.863
<i>now that Ted started
raising monsters,</i>

13:15.948 --> 13:17.825
but it's your move.

13:18.102 --> 13:19.895
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.455
This isn't a game to me.

13:21.869 --> 13:26.134
Okay, then you forfeit
your turn. King me.

13:26.277 --> 13:28.105
Is that what this
is about to you?

13:28.506 --> 13:29.840
Power? Control?

13:29.925 --> 13:31.384
Well, it sure beats
the alternative.

13:31.469 --> 13:34.011
And no offense, but a
bloodthirsty vampire like you

13:34.096 --> 13:35.649
isn't exactly qualified
to lecture

13:35.734 --> 13:38.361
this plain old thirsty
witch on control.

13:38.446 --> 13:41.532
Maybe that's exactly why
you should listen to me.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.313
Because I know what it's like

13:43.398 --> 13:45.320
to think of yourself
as a monster.

13:45.436 --> 13:47.039
To be called one
by your parents.

13:47.322 --> 13:50.271
I know you're desperate and all,
but that's low.

13:50.356 --> 13:52.663
You know the mom-and-dad card
is triggering for me

13:52.748 --> 13:55.003
since I incinerated mine.

13:56.977 --> 13:58.709
Game over!
I actually

13:58.794 --> 14:01.448
don't know
much about it.

14:01.956 --> 14:04.464
I mean, I-I know what
happened but not why.

14:04.557 --> 14:07.620
- Though I'm sure I could guess.
- Okay, then.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.349
Have it your way.

14:09.553 --> 14:11.030
Let's play that game.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.739
Your parents saw
the worst in you

14:13.942 --> 14:15.860
when they found out
you were supernatural.

14:15.976 --> 14:18.148
They rejected you,
and that hurt.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.968
So you wanted to share that
pain with everyone else,

14:21.065 --> 14:23.775
hoping that would
make it go away.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.839
(imitates buzzer sound)

14:26.069 --> 14:30.281
Wrong answer, but don't worry,
we've got lovely parting gifts.

14:30.365 --> 14:31.658
Then prove me wrong.

14:33.744 --> 14:35.745
Tell me what really
happened to you, Alyssa.

14:36.377 --> 14:38.980
My parents loved me.

14:39.223 --> 14:41.291
Okay?
Me being a witch

14:41.376 --> 14:42.896
didn't matter to them.

14:43.389 --> 14:45.756
All they ever wanted was
the best for me.

14:46.389 --> 14:49.684
But I still lost control.

14:49.927 --> 14:52.554
And how did that
work out for them?

14:52.638 --> 14:54.139
They're dead.

14:54.223 --> 14:56.733
But your crappy parents
are still alive.

14:56.892 --> 14:59.728
So cry me a freaking river, MG.

15:00.908 --> 15:02.743
(pained groan)

15:02.898 --> 15:04.608
(groaning)
MG!

15:04.866 --> 15:06.347
MG!

15:08.695 --> 15:10.542
Ted raised something
big.

15:10.627 --> 15:12.364
I linked this portal
to his location.

15:12.449 --> 15:14.075
It must have just
come out on his side.

15:14.159 --> 15:17.579
I'm sorry. Even if I wanted to
change my mind, it's too late.

15:17.663 --> 15:19.049
He's in control now.

15:19.134 --> 15:20.957
Not changing mine, either.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.631
Because you were right,
and I was wrong.

15:24.734 --> 15:26.234
Our stories aren't the same.

15:26.319 --> 15:29.072
I had to prove my parents
wrong.

15:30.448 --> 15:32.423
All you have to do is
prove yours right.

15:33.742 --> 15:35.563
Find a way to stop this

15:35.648 --> 15:38.212
before The Necromancer
gets what he wants.

15:46.199 --> 15:48.526
See, Jo? Just like
riding a bike.

15:48.611 --> 15:50.354
- MG.
- Oh, God.

16:00.658 --> 16:02.565
NECROMANCER:
I wouldn't touch that.

16:05.743 --> 16:07.786
Okay, I don't have to
listen to you.

16:07.871 --> 16:10.915
I'm not dead, so you
can't stop me. (chuckles)

16:11.133 --> 16:13.551
My dear, dull boy,

16:13.635 --> 16:15.303
I don't plan to.

16:15.387 --> 16:17.283
Okay, then what is
your plan, exactly?

16:17.722 --> 16:20.134
To have my revenge.

16:20.219 --> 16:23.344
To fuel a spell so powerful

16:23.520 --> 16:26.564
it will set every monster
within Malivore loose

16:26.648 --> 16:29.150
to rain destruction
upon this world.

16:29.234 --> 16:32.094
Consuming humans the way

16:32.179 --> 16:34.386
Malivore once consumed us...

16:34.511 --> 16:39.223
and to have them all serve me.

16:39.501 --> 16:41.346
That's way more petty
than I thought.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.015
Everyone keeps saying.
Yeah, yeah.

16:43.373 --> 16:45.271
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:45.356 --> 16:47.383
I have a blood sacrifice
to attend.

16:47.579 --> 16:49.205
Well, the only thing
you'll be attending

16:49.290 --> 16:50.750
is the afterlife
once Hope gets here.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.183
Well, beats your family reunion.

16:57.314 --> 16:58.774
(groans)

16:59.056 --> 17:00.431
(low growl)

17:00.640 --> 17:02.319
Hey, Dad.

17:07.422 --> 17:09.382
NECROMANCER: Listen
well, my new acolyte.

17:09.467 --> 17:12.171
End Landon Kirby
as you see fit.

17:12.314 --> 17:13.843
Savor it,

17:13.928 --> 17:17.041
as it will be you last act
of free will.

17:17.127 --> 17:20.871
Then come to me so your
eternity of misery can begin,

17:20.955 --> 17:22.582
my faithful servant.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.776
(sighs)

17:25.648 --> 17:27.753
We'll have to work on that bow.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.845
Less head, more knees.

17:31.126 --> 17:32.023
(growling)

17:32.148 --> 17:33.899
Aw, man. Okay.

17:34.414 --> 17:35.714
(grunts)

17:35.799 --> 17:36.850
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:36.935 --> 17:38.308
You want to get back at
The Necro, right? I can help.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.012
Just-just-just hear me out
instead of consuming me!

17:43.492 --> 17:46.124
I'll take that as a yes.

17:46.669 --> 17:48.045
JOSIE:
How bad is it?

17:48.129 --> 17:51.966
On a scale from horrific
to apocalyptic,

17:52.380 --> 17:54.493
a 12?

17:54.928 --> 17:56.804
Can you even imagine
how much black magic is

17:56.888 --> 17:58.014
brewing in that thing?

17:58.098 --> 17:59.712
Trust me, I can.
It's been inside me.

17:59.797 --> 18:01.382
MG:
I know how we can stop it.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.478
But you're gonna hate it.

18:03.652 --> 18:04.940
More than dying?

18:05.060 --> 18:07.565
That's a pretty low bar.

18:07.649 --> 18:08.899
(groans)

18:08.983 --> 18:10.443
Wake Alyssa up.

18:10.527 --> 18:12.236
There's no way in hell
that we're doing that.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.321
Lizzie, she knows
the spell.

18:14.405 --> 18:16.657
She linked it to
The Necromancer.

18:16.741 --> 18:21.078
So she can stop it
or help rewrite it...

18:21.269 --> 18:25.215
or find some other loophole
with-with your help.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.814
If we could trust her.

18:27.958 --> 18:29.991
All you gotta do
is trust me.

18:30.659 --> 18:32.430
She'll do the right thing.

18:32.924 --> 18:35.265
I'm literally betting
my life on it.

18:38.971 --> 18:40.931
LANDON: The spell The
Necromancer did to raise you

18:41.015 --> 18:42.600
must have also
made you his servant.

18:42.684 --> 18:44.685
And I'm willing to bet
that new symbol on your face

18:44.769 --> 18:45.974
is the binding part
of that spell.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.313
I mean, I don't take
many witchcraft classes,

18:48.398 --> 18:51.108
but I am dating
the most badass witch ever.

18:51.192 --> 18:53.506
I'd say you two should meet,
but you kind of already have,

18:53.591 --> 18:55.863
and her blood is the only thing
that's toxic to you, so...

18:55.947 --> 18:57.507
- (growls)
- Awkward.

18:57.651 --> 18:59.861
And she's also super
protective of me, so I'm

19:00.008 --> 19:01.857
definitely somebody
you want to collaborate with

19:01.941 --> 19:03.162
instead of eat.

19:03.246 --> 19:04.830
(purring)

19:04.914 --> 19:07.406
The bottom line is actually
something Hope taught me.

19:07.875 --> 19:10.336
There is always a loophole
with magic.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.921
We just have to figure out
what that is.

19:12.005 --> 19:13.793
(snorts)
The Necromancer said

19:13.878 --> 19:16.206
to end me as you see fit.

19:16.531 --> 19:17.885
That's a loophole,
because even though

19:17.969 --> 19:20.893
you have to do what he says,
he gave you a lot of...

19:22.014 --> 19:23.389
wiggle room.

19:23.953 --> 19:25.434
(groans softly)

19:25.883 --> 19:27.937
You created me
to be your vessel, right?

19:28.649 --> 19:32.304
Then use me to destroy him
and free yourself.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.830
I may not be
immortal anymore,

19:35.061 --> 19:37.363
but there's no symbol on my
forehead that binds me to him.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.073
(sighs)

19:39.252 --> 19:40.962
What do you say, Dad?

19:51.437 --> 19:54.152
(door bangs open)

19:57.914 --> 19:59.757
This is the door Landon was
talking about. Go, go, go.

19:59.841 --> 20:01.220
- Ethan?
- Hope.

20:01.304 --> 20:02.982
You saw Landon?
Yeah, he told my sister and I

20:03.066 --> 20:04.557
to sneak everyone
out of the school

20:04.641 --> 20:06.100
once he disabled the tractor
beam, whatever that means.

20:06.184 --> 20:08.232
- He did it. Where was he?
- Last I saw,

20:08.317 --> 20:09.302
he was headed
towards the football field.

20:09.387 --> 20:11.034
Okay, you need to go.
So do I.

20:15.985 --> 20:17.403
(indistinct shouting)

20:17.907 --> 20:20.368
You're too late.

20:20.909 --> 20:23.199
I've already seen
how you die,

20:23.284 --> 20:25.391
as surely as
I once foresaw

20:25.557 --> 20:27.647
that we should meet again.

20:27.732 --> 20:30.327
Well, I'm guessing
you failed to foresee

20:30.412 --> 20:31.708
that this was a trap.

20:31.793 --> 20:33.336
(gunshot)

20:38.230 --> 20:39.800
I told you we had guns.

20:40.167 --> 20:42.219
Ethan and Maya are safe,
along with their classmates,

20:42.303 --> 20:43.345
thanks to your students.

20:43.429 --> 20:44.889
Thanks to you for trusting me.

20:44.973 --> 20:46.554
Oh, it's the least I could do
after last night.

20:46.638 --> 20:48.058
Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

20:48.142 --> 20:49.518
Now, go, round up
your team.

20:49.603 --> 20:50.644
With The Lion King
dead here,

20:50.728 --> 20:52.104
it's time we took
the fight to them.

20:52.188 --> 20:53.898
Copy that.
Where are you going?

20:53.982 --> 20:55.998
I got to go handle,
uh, Bullwinkle.

20:57.692 --> 21:00.856
NECROMANCER:
More blood, more monsters.

21:00.941 --> 21:04.032
I must thank you for helping me
solve this little dilemma.

21:04.373 --> 21:08.662
You know, teaching really is
the noblest of professions.

21:08.746 --> 21:10.289
(laughs)

21:10.373 --> 21:13.000
Caedis. Fomes.

21:13.084 --> 21:15.294
Gnavigem vectorium.

21:15.378 --> 21:17.478
LANDON:
Necromancer!

21:17.821 --> 21:20.196
Oh, you are

21:20.281 --> 21:22.355
a resilient little cockroach.

21:23.052 --> 21:24.428
You're just in time

21:24.512 --> 21:26.232
to witness the end
of your world, Mr. Kirby.

21:31.477 --> 21:33.256
(groans)

21:34.027 --> 21:35.775
This is not my world.

21:36.259 --> 21:40.365
And I am not Landon Kirby.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.249
What do you mean, you're not...

21:42.462 --> 21:43.755
(gasps)

21:45.340 --> 21:47.176
(whispers):
Malivore.

21:52.502 --> 21:55.202
Mr. Malivore.
This isn't necessary.

21:55.393 --> 21:57.278
Surely, we can cut a deal.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.989
Be reasonable!

22:01.517 --> 22:05.350
My very veins course
with black magic.

22:06.606 --> 22:09.726
I can give you anything
your muddy heart desires

22:09.826 --> 22:12.237
if you only say the word.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.262
You cannot be serious.

22:20.794 --> 22:23.181
(sighs)
Jed two, Kaleb zero.

22:23.266 --> 22:24.830
Who sucks
at killing zombies now?

22:24.932 --> 22:26.600
I distracted it.
Don't tell me

22:26.685 --> 22:28.019
- you're gonna ignore my assist again.
- Oh, come on, man.

22:28.103 --> 22:29.334
- This isn't hockey.
- ALARIC: All right, boys,

22:29.418 --> 22:31.588
quit bickering.
Hey, nice job.

22:31.673 --> 22:33.407
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

22:35.734 --> 22:37.152
Doc.

22:37.237 --> 22:38.643
Is that normal?

22:38.728 --> 22:40.191
No.

22:45.847 --> 22:47.641
What the bloody hell was that?

22:48.333 --> 22:49.456
I don't care.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.000
(groans)

22:51.084 --> 22:52.857
I know what I want from you.

22:52.942 --> 22:55.535
Well, then you're far better
at negotiating

22:55.620 --> 22:57.694
than that meat suit
you're wearing.

22:57.962 --> 23:00.038
And I'm all ears.

23:01.634 --> 23:03.469
I want you to die.

23:11.896 --> 23:14.232
(creature screeching)

23:32.800 --> 23:34.480
No!

23:56.858 --> 23:59.065
NECROMANCER:
Ashes to ashes.

23:59.407 --> 24:01.451
Phoenix or not.

24:03.504 --> 24:04.754
Landon.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.716
Landon, you say?

24:06.993 --> 24:10.080
Oh, I'm afraid
you just missed him.

24:11.559 --> 24:13.644
But my dragon didn't.

24:16.211 --> 24:18.254
(cackles)

24:18.758 --> 24:20.551
(bell tolls)

24:21.344 --> 24:22.842
We can't find Hope or Landon.

24:22.926 --> 24:24.348
What do you mean?
They're obviously here.

24:24.432 --> 24:25.891
Well, I have the
whole precinct

24:25.976 --> 24:27.603
and your entire school
scouring this campus.

24:27.687 --> 24:29.815
We checked all the other
classrooms, the football field.

24:29.899 --> 24:33.666
There's no sign of them or any
monsters. They're just gone.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.464
NECROMANCER: Well,
aren't you gonna say anything?

24:36.548 --> 24:39.259
You're always good
for a snarky quip.

24:39.526 --> 24:41.152
Hmm? No?

24:41.236 --> 24:43.613
(chuckles)
All right.

24:43.697 --> 24:45.242
Have it your way, then.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.242
As long as your
way is well done.

24:48.469 --> 24:51.545
Because I'm about to have my pet
come back and barbecue you,

24:51.630 --> 24:53.770
just like your boyfriend.
(laughs)

24:53.855 --> 24:57.544
Some all-powerful
tribrid you are.

25:06.211 --> 25:08.346
Bring dragons back
all you want.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.556
They're always gonna
have a soft spot.

25:10.794 --> 25:12.558
As I've always had one
for you.

25:12.642 --> 25:13.797
Save your breath.

25:13.882 --> 25:16.276
You'll be dead
before it even gets here.

25:16.364 --> 25:17.970
I don't even breathe,

25:18.055 --> 25:20.656
for I am the Herald of Hades.

25:20.741 --> 25:22.809
The Grimmest
of Reapers.

25:22.894 --> 25:26.540
I am death incarnate!

25:26.653 --> 25:28.971
You can't kill me.

25:29.056 --> 25:30.349
(laughs)

25:32.857 --> 25:34.205
Maybe not.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.099
But I can stick
that head of yours

25:36.184 --> 25:38.603
in some very unpleasant places.

25:40.845 --> 25:42.453
LANDON:
Can I play, too?

25:47.492 --> 25:49.220
You were right,
by the way.

25:49.304 --> 25:51.471
I don't need a weapon
if I have you.

25:51.848 --> 25:53.474
Landon?

25:54.181 --> 25:58.020
In the flesh. Somehow.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.725
Prove it.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.358
♪ ♪

26:20.537 --> 26:23.080
How is this happening?
I have no idea.

26:23.379 --> 26:26.174
There is no earthly explanation
for me coming back to life.

26:27.204 --> 26:28.831
Unless...

26:30.552 --> 26:32.324
That flash of light.

26:32.806 --> 26:34.807
ALARIC: Hope, Landon
and the monsters got sent

26:34.891 --> 26:36.851
- to a prison world.
- That flash of light we saw.

26:36.935 --> 26:38.548
That explains why
they were here one minute

26:38.632 --> 26:39.562
and then gone the next.

26:39.646 --> 26:40.667
It has to be.

26:40.752 --> 26:42.772
You care to translate for
those of us who didn't

26:42.857 --> 26:44.729
believe monsters existed
until before this morning?

26:44.813 --> 26:46.023
It's an alternative
dimension

26:46.108 --> 26:47.429
that looks exactly
like our world,

26:47.514 --> 26:48.987
except without all the people.

26:49.072 --> 26:51.361
- Got it. So, heaven.
- It's more like limbo.

26:51.446 --> 26:53.073
If you're banished
to a prison world and you die,

26:53.157 --> 26:54.991
it just brings you back
to life again.

26:55.076 --> 26:57.001
The only thing
I don't understand is...

26:58.868 --> 27:00.411
...why are we still here?

27:01.043 --> 27:02.509
NECROMANCER:
I consecrated the school

27:02.594 --> 27:03.643
and this field,

27:03.728 --> 27:06.463
used black magic to
tether them to Malivore

27:06.548 --> 27:08.950
to summon him.
(sighs)

27:09.089 --> 27:11.007
It was all working so perfectly.

27:11.091 --> 27:12.175
Well, whatever you did,

27:12.260 --> 27:14.123
- thanks for the extra life.
- Don't thank him.

27:14.208 --> 27:15.584
I doubt he's the one
that linked

27:15.669 --> 27:17.697
those spells to the ascendant
that sent us here.

27:17.977 --> 27:19.686
The tribrid's right.

27:19.771 --> 27:23.075
I should never have trusted
that blasted witch.

27:24.114 --> 27:25.364
Alyssa Chang.

27:25.449 --> 27:27.032
Seriously?

27:27.309 --> 27:29.519
Literally no one
trusts Alyssa Chang.

27:29.707 --> 27:32.387
Well, that girl never met
a linking spell she didn't like.

27:36.586 --> 27:38.254
Riddle me this, Yorick.

27:38.339 --> 27:40.410
- How do we get out of here?
- We don't.

27:40.495 --> 27:42.441
Not until someone in our world
finds a way to pull us out.

27:42.525 --> 27:43.741
Which we can't let them do

27:43.826 --> 27:45.157
while you're still raising
creatures from Malivore,

27:45.241 --> 27:48.184
not to mention Malivore
himself. See the problem?

27:48.269 --> 27:49.724
It's our
problem now.

27:49.809 --> 27:51.852
So be a dear

27:51.971 --> 27:54.306
and put me head back on me body,
would you?

27:54.391 --> 27:56.163
There may be another way.

27:56.777 --> 27:58.237
If you trust me.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.803
Have you lost
your mind?

27:59.888 --> 28:02.377
Trust's what got me
in this mess in the first place.

28:02.462 --> 28:04.255
I wasn't talking to you.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.796
I mean, do you even have to ask
the question at this point?

28:08.855 --> 28:10.064
(groans)

28:10.149 --> 28:12.252
You two are unbearable!

28:12.569 --> 28:14.237
Ow. What are you doing? No.

28:14.599 --> 28:17.393
Don't you dare.

Sangiema Meam...

28:32.700 --> 28:35.119
Um, Earth to witches?

28:36.569 --> 28:40.698
I suddenly feel a lot better.

28:41.629 --> 28:43.613
Uh, are we cool?

28:50.077 --> 28:52.967
Yeah. I think so.

28:54.099 --> 28:55.398
What did you do?

28:55.483 --> 28:57.359
We created a new prison world.

28:57.609 --> 29:00.862
We moved all the spells Alyssa
linked to our world to it.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.524
So you're both free.

29:03.216 --> 29:04.791
ALYSSA:
I mean, it's not

29:04.876 --> 29:07.151
the prettiest ascendant
I've ever seen,

29:07.236 --> 29:10.028
but I'm really lucky

29:10.113 --> 29:11.849
a pair of Gemini twins
showed up.

29:12.606 --> 29:14.215
And that you guys have
a seemingly endless

29:14.299 --> 29:15.351
amount of Bennet blood.

29:15.436 --> 29:17.939
Not to mention the supernova
still going on.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.059
Thank you.

29:21.006 --> 29:23.842
I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

29:24.128 --> 29:26.426
Don't thank us. Thank MG.

29:26.511 --> 29:28.015
If it weren't for him,
we would have tossed you

29:28.099 --> 29:29.266
into the pit by now.

29:29.514 --> 29:30.991
JOSIE: You're welcome,

29:31.076 --> 29:32.702

MG: We should
probably head back...

29:34.878 --> 29:36.796
...let Dr. Saltzman know
what's going on,

29:37.333 --> 29:40.636

Oh, yes. Oh...

30:12.368 --> 30:15.881
Uh, okay, are you sure
this is gonna work?

30:15.966 --> 30:18.408
No, I'm not. That's where
the trust comes in.

about letting Malivore

30:20.001 --> 30:21.236
use you as a vessel?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.016
Double no.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.735
Although, if I came back,
won't the prison world

30:24.819 --> 30:26.583
resurrect Malivore, too?

30:27.051 --> 30:28.843

right back out.

33:01.275 --> 33:02.978
or why the pit
is suddenly empty.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.783
Maybe it's because

33:04.868 --> 33:06.411
we came through
the portal together?

33:06.495 --> 33:09.334
Maybe it's because I let
Malivore use me as a vessel.

33:09.623 --> 33:11.757
Whatever it was,
something's changed.

33:12.054 --> 33:14.623
Well, milkshake first,
then mythology.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.369
Well, I woke up first

33:16.454 --> 33:18.205
after we came through
the portal, obviously.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.042
I figured you could use
the rest, so I set you up

33:20.126 --> 33:22.128
on the bench
and then headed for The Grill.

33:22.344 --> 33:24.611
Yeah, not exactly the
big anniversary date

33:24.696 --> 33:27.156
I had planned, but
what are you gonna do?

33:27.940 --> 33:29.831
So then we made it?
This is our world?

33:29.916 --> 33:31.959
I didn't see a single soul,

33:32.129 --> 33:33.496
but I don't know
if that's because

33:33.581 --> 33:34.714
the town's
been evacuated

33:34.799 --> 33:36.591
or we're somewhere else.

33:36.676 --> 33:38.353
Okay, we should probably
head back and find out.

33:38.437 --> 33:39.953
Okay, just... wait, wait.

33:40.112 --> 33:41.822
One dance first.

33:48.306 --> 33:49.805
Okay.

♪ ♪

34:07.687 --> 34:09.690
This brings back memories.

34:10.509 --> 34:12.817
Speaking of,
it's highly unlikely

34:12.902 --> 34:14.763
that anyone remembers us.

34:15.123 --> 34:17.706
I was thinking
we could keep it that way.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.292
I can't.

34:23.106 --> 34:24.597
(whispers):
I know.

34:26.408 --> 34:27.871
It's nice to indulge
in the fantasy

34:27.956 --> 34:30.166
for a second, right?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.335
Our reality is better

I'm boozing at Hogwarts.

36:13.788 --> 36:17.113
That Mystic Falls is overrun
with supernatural creatures.

36:17.285 --> 36:20.569
It gets easier when you think
of it as their home, too.

36:20.909 --> 36:22.356

36:38.064 --> 36:40.065
Yeah.
But,

36:40.470 --> 36:43.998
I want you to compel her
to remember everything.

36:44.379 --> 36:46.747
You want me... That sphinx
hit you in the head, didn't it?

36:46.833 --> 36:48.960
I know this changes everything.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.959

37:27.503 --> 37:28.796
of a party.

37:29.825 --> 37:31.358
Been doing
some thinking.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.167
You sure I should be
the one to have this?

37:33.547 --> 37:36.252
That ascendant's the only thing
keeping The Necromancer

37:36.337 --> 37:38.881
locked away, so I'm
just as sure as you were

37:38.966 --> 37:40.508
that I'd do the right thing.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.219
Even when I wasn't.

37:42.455 --> 37:44.707
It's just because it's easier
to believe in others

37:44.792 --> 37:46.710
than to believe in yourself.

37:46.795 --> 37:48.088
But all I did
was give you a chance

37:48.172 --> 37:49.838
to make the right decision.

37:50.274 --> 37:51.458
And...

37:51.543 --> 37:54.254
I'm kind of hoping
you'll return the favor.

37:55.653 --> 37:57.845
You sort of saved
the world today

37:58.030 --> 38:01.462
- and salvaged what's left
of my reputation. - (chuckles)

38:02.495 --> 38:04.249
What did you have in mind?

38:04.495 --> 38:07.199
Just you seeing
that I do understand

38:07.284 --> 38:10.463
what you're going through,
romantically speaking.

38:10.673 --> 38:13.498
Because I've lived
that same story with Lizzie,

38:13.881 --> 38:16.009
and the truth is,

38:16.408 --> 38:19.664
I've been treating you
the same way that she treats me.

38:20.514 --> 38:23.222
So I know what it's like
to be on the other end of that.

38:25.364 --> 38:27.871
I've always seen you,
Milton.

38:28.365 --> 38:31.524
So the only
question is...

38:33.337 --> 38:34.838
...what do you want
to do with that?

38:34.923 --> 38:36.832
What I wish would have
happened for me.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.635
I want to give us a shot.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.852
I-If you're down with that,
because I know the time...

39:11.227 --> 39:13.061
How'd it go with MG?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.628
I missed my window.

39:18.815 --> 39:22.031
I guess I always thought
that he would be there,

39:22.662 --> 39:24.875
waiting for me to be okay.

39:27.608 --> 39:28.973
I'm sorry.

39:29.817 --> 39:35.107
I guess... I'm happy
that he's okay, too.

39:35.806 --> 39:40.168
Even if Alyssa
is cleaning his tonsils.

39:42.024 --> 39:43.942
Thanks for helping him, Jo.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.101
For helping me.

39:46.349 --> 39:48.265
It's what we do
for each other, right?

39:49.020 --> 39:50.606
But I am

39:50.690 --> 39:52.261
not ready to do magic.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.972
So I put it away again.

39:54.955 --> 39:56.742
Hold this for me?

40:02.767 --> 40:05.163
Whatever you think is best.

40:05.574 --> 40:07.944
I've been thinking about
that a lot, actually.

40:08.596 --> 40:11.794
The whole reason I was
at the high school is because

40:11.878 --> 40:14.332
I want to transfer
to Mystic Falls.

40:14.817 --> 40:17.800
Live a non-witch life
for a minute

40:17.884 --> 40:19.821
or however long it takes.

40:21.898 --> 40:23.983
If I have your support.

40:27.119 --> 40:28.609
HOPE:
You okay?

40:30.109 --> 40:33.821
I mean, was that...

40:34.901 --> 40:36.426
Weirdly perfect.

40:41.449 --> 40:43.276
Is that what flying feels like?

40:43.369 --> 40:44.953
(both laugh)

40:45.138 --> 40:47.182
Flying is way less awesome.

40:47.267 --> 40:48.267
(chuckles)

40:50.999 --> 40:54.239
You know, I never thought that

40:54.513 --> 40:58.171
I could be this... happy.

41:00.296 --> 41:01.838
So I gave up on it.

41:02.248 --> 41:03.741
All I had to do was

41:03.826 --> 41:05.260
let myself.

41:06.670 --> 41:08.546
Let myself be with you.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.327
(coughing)

41:11.715 --> 41:13.236
Hey, are you okay?

41:14.727 --> 41:15.937
Hope.

41:18.769 --> 41:20.037
(gasps)

41:21.235 --> 41:22.926
- Landon...
- What's happening?

41:23.765 --> 41:25.350
Landon?

41:25.721 --> 41:26.965
Landon?

41:27.870 --> 41:29.538
Landon.

41:31.979 --> 41:33.522
