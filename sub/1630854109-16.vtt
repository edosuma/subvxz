WEBVTT

00:07.075 --> 00:08.376
Bye, babe.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.911
I'll pick up the groceries
on my way home.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.951
Oh, uh, and add sardines
to the list.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.687
And blueberries.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.122
You're sure?

00:21.222 --> 00:23.524
Oh, you think I'm
weird, don't you?

00:23.624 --> 00:25.226
I think you're beautiful.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.994
And weird.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.265
Hon, I'm sorry.
Of course, you're not weird.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.034
You're perfect.
No. Jared, look.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.873
What the hell?

00:59.827 --> 01:03.731
Hey, Katie.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.333
Are you drunk?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.601
Maybe. A little.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.503
I didn't get out of Air Raid
till 2:00 a.m.,

01:09.603 --> 01:11.439
and there was this
off-the-hook after-party,

01:11.539 --> 01:13.507
and everybody...
Did you set up the meet?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.843
Not exactly.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.812
The truth is,
I'm not sure this whole

01:18.912 --> 01:21.982
confidential informant thing
is working for me.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.585
It's not a choice, Kenny.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.888
Well, I mean,
it kind of is, right?

01:27.988 --> 01:30.191
No! You were busted
with enough contraband

01:30.291 --> 01:31.992
to send you away
for years, so either

01:32.092 --> 01:34.695
help me get evidence on
the prison guards you sell to,

01:34.795 --> 01:36.697
or I take you back to jail.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.300
But those jerks still owe me
five grand on the last deal.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.335
The money doesn't matter.
It does to me.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.004
They think I'm some chump
they can short? No, no, no, no.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.607
They need to make it right,
or there is no deal.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.941
It's a sting operation.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.843
That is the whole point
of the deal.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.180
You don't keep the money
either way.
What's in it for me?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.781
Staying out of prison.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.852
Okay, just set up
the meet, Kenny,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.455
or I'm done trying to help you.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.792
You call this "help"?

02:10.164 --> 02:12.166
Morning, boss. Morning.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.503
Assuming there's more than
just some stolen tires?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.305
Actually, there's not.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.972
Whole bunch
of stolen tires, though.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.909
Okay and that requires
the SAC because?

02:22.009 --> 02:24.178
Well, less
about what was stolen,

02:24.278 --> 02:26.180
more about
who it was stolen from.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.381
Lot of brass live here.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.750
Highly motivated
to get some answers.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.352
Which means we are, too. Yep.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.920
Okay. How many cars were hit?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.689
12. Sometime between 1:00
and 6:00 in the morning.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.091
Whoever nabbed the tires
somehow got on base

02:38.192 --> 02:40.294
and close to their homes
without being spotted.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.162
So, no witnesses?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.697
None so far. Hey.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.366
Residents who have security cams
all report

02:45.466 --> 02:48.236
their systems going down
for several hours last night.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.737
At the same time?
Yeah.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.539
So, somebody hacked into
everyone's security systems

02:51.639 --> 02:52.873
to steal tires?

02:52.973 --> 02:55.008
Seems more like a prank
than theft.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.112
Hey, Boom-Boom's back!

02:59.213 --> 03:00.814
Doesn't seem too happy about it.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.383
BOOM-BOOM: 36 hours ago,
I was taking apart

03:02.483 --> 03:04.017
an IED in Bahrain.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.220
Now my talents are evidently
needed to identify a...

03:06.320 --> 03:08.088
tire thief.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.557
Well, your talents
are always appreciated.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.992
Just to be clear,
we didn't call.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.694
Oh, my boss did.
Lives in the neighborhood.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.796
Asked me to do what I could
to figure this out.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.665
I'm not sure
you're gonna have much luck.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.668
Thieves--
they-they were smart.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.237
They used gloves,
disabled the cameras,

03:23.337 --> 03:24.372
so there's

03:24.472 --> 03:25.439
not much evidence.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.107
So you're doubting my abilities?

03:27.941 --> 03:30.744
No. No, no.
That's not what I meant.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.914
Good, 'cause
that'd be a mistake. Mm.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.949
It's nice to have you back,
Boom-Boom.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.786
It's always good to see you,
Special Agent Tennant.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.588
Boone.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.425
I-I would... I'd never
doubt your abilities.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.693
Uh-huh.
Never!

03:45.793 --> 03:47.495
Keep me updated. Yeah.

03:47.595 --> 03:51.399
I just... I thought
Boom-Boom and I were good.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.768
Maybe talk less.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.740
<i>We've been planning
this for months,</i>

03:59.840 --> 04:01.775
and suddenly he
gets cold feet?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.877
Over five grand
he'll never actually get.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.447
He's a criminal. They're not
known for being dependable

04:06.547 --> 04:08.048
or smart.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.083
ASAC Curtis wanted to give Kenny
Sparks to a more senior agent,

04:10.183 --> 04:12.286
and I convinced him
to trust me to handle it.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.787
I can't screw it up.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.789
He really calls himself
"Kenny Sparks"?

04:15.889 --> 04:18.025
Yeah. Tells you everything
you need to know.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.793
This is the first CI
you've handled.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.529
Give it time.
I don't have time.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.263
Curtis wants the meet
set this week.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.665
Take down the prison guards.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.367
It's a big case.
'Cause

04:26.467 --> 04:28.902
Kenny sells them burner phones
and drugs for the inmates?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.639
And the guards have info
on every gang inside the prison.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.974
I mean, it could help make a lot
of other cases.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.743
Look, I can't help you
with Kenny,

04:35.843 --> 04:37.645
but I can tell you this.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.047
You are smart, resourceful,

04:40.147 --> 04:42.683
and you look fantastic
in that suit.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.553
You got this.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.822
Morning, Kate. FBI have
something for us on tire-gate?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.724
Uh, no.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.727
Just dropped in
for a little moral support.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.797
But I'll leave you to it.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.166
Everything okay?

04:59.266 --> 05:02.403
Kate's running her first CI,
and he's giving her problems.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.339
Ah. They almost always do.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.040
Any luck
with the security footage?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.676
Still going through it.
Nothing yet.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.077
All right,
go back a few hours.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.679
They could've been
on base and waiting.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.582
Well, it looks like
Ernie's got something.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.417
All right, go check it out.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.419
I got to update the base
commander in a couple hours.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.688
Hoping to have
something to share.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.190
Hey.
What do tires, spoons,

05:23.290 --> 05:25.393
mannequins and golf trophies
have in common?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.995
Uh... they're all nouns?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.229
Really?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.698
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.165
Yeah. I'm at a loss, too.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.868
I'm hoping that wasn't
just a random question.

05:34.968 --> 05:38.005
I don't think tires were
this thief's first caper.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.573
Caper?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.241
Has more flair
than "illicit activity."

05:41.341 --> 05:43.911
I found similar crimes
going back the last few months.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.480
Three country clubs were hit.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.181
But only the golf trophies
were stolen.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.418
They worth anything?
Only to the people
who won them.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.719
And this one:

05:51.819 --> 05:54.522
a bunch of luxury
clothing stores

05:54.622 --> 05:56.023
at the mall were burglarized,

05:56.123 --> 05:57.825
and the thieves only
took the mannequins.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.260
Very caper-esque.
See? And finally,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.063
a neighborhood on the
windward side of the island

06:03.163 --> 06:04.932
had seven houses robbed
in one night.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.199
Well, that's more serious.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.437
Not when you hear
what they stole. Spoons.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.804
Spoons?

06:10.904 --> 06:12.806
Bizarre, right?

06:12.906 --> 06:15.876
Well, clearly, suspect's not
doing this for the money.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.411
All the other thefts
happened off base?

06:17.511 --> 06:20.280
Yeah. And I can't find
any connections between them.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.115
Oh, it's Jesse.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.151
Maybe he found something
at the crime scene.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.054
Well?
Uh,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.056
actually,
they... <i>lost</i> something.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.324
BOOM-BOOM:
<i>How can it be gone?!</i>

06:31.425 --> 06:33.126
It was right there.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.328
It's okay. It's okay.
We're locking down the base.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.130
We'll find your van.
Okay?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.633
How is this okay
when all the evidence

06:39.733 --> 06:40.868
I collected was in there?

06:40.968 --> 06:42.870
Right. Definitely not okay.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.573
We got it. Ernie tracked
the van using GPS.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.374
It's one block over.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.313
Oh, easy. It doesn't feel right.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.649
What? Like it's a trap?
Easy enough

06:55.749 --> 06:58.552
to set explosives,
wait for us to get close.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.287
Get back!

07:04.391 --> 07:05.826
What the hell?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.461
What is that?

07:08.696 --> 07:11.665
Elephant toothpaste.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.300
Is it dangerous?

07:13.400 --> 07:17.204
Only to my evidence...
and my pride.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
It's kind of awesome.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.222
Devon Gage and Ross Lamont
have a combined 15 years

07:35.322 --> 07:36.757
of working at FDC Honolulu.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.827
Operating a criminal
enterprise the whole time.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.762
Agent Whistler.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.865
Uh, Gage and Lamont run a
contraband pipeline to convicts.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.233
A couple months ago,

07:46.333 --> 07:47.735
I identified their supplier--
Kenny Sparks.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.504
Took some convincing,
but he agreed to wear a wire,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.673
set a meet to take them down.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.676
We make a case against these
guards, and we can turn them.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.377
Gain access
to the inner workings

07:57.477 --> 07:59.379
of criminal networks
across the state.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.815
We'll have a time and place
soon, so let's prep.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.985
I want to share an ops plan
with the OIG by end-of-day.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.420
Thank you.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.358
Kate?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.460
How's it going with Sparks?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.963
Uh...
He's a handful.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.065
I've been there.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.266
You've done a great job so far.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.601
Identifying him,
bringing him in,

08:20.701 --> 08:22.870
getting him
to cooperate.
Thank you.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.574
But I'm wondering why Sparks
hasn't set the meet yet.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.276
Kenny's being difficult.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.911
Cold feet?
Not exactly.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.948
There's a financial dispute
between him and our targets.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.684
Nothing I can't handle.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.319
No doubt. Still,
it wouldn't hurt for me to, uh,

08:39.419 --> 08:42.189
meet him myself,
just to kick the tires.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.257
He's pretty nervous already.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.895
I don't need to tell you how
much we've got riding on this.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.098
I'd like for you to set that up.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.667
Of course. I'll call him now.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.577
Yes, I got a couple
of acceptances,

09:03.677 --> 09:05.245
but I'm still
waiting to hear back

09:05.345 --> 09:07.480
from my first choice, and...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.586
Um, hey, I got to go, okay?

09:12.686 --> 09:15.455
Okay. Yup, talk later.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.157
Didn't hear you come in.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.692
Years of stealth training.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.762
As a spy?
As a nosy mom.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.632
I don't remember you mentioning
a first-choice college.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.134
Probably 'cause I didn't.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.503
But you have one?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.641
I got to study.
Yeah, sure.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.242
You know what? I didn't
even want to know anyways.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.245
Reverse psychology? Really?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.881
It was worth a try. Embarrassing
to both of us.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.150
But not as embarrassing
as Jesse and Kai.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.319
They're totally blowing up
on RushCut, literally.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.858
Wait. What does any
of that mean?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.060
You haven't seen it yet?
Seen what?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.895
For real? Look, okay.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.130
It's got, like,
10,000 hits.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.131
Get back!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.501
What the hell? What is that?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.771
I sent it to Gracie,
made sure she saw it.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.306
Yeah, I'm sure
her dad appreciated that.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.075
Who posted this?

10:08.175 --> 10:10.010
Mm. Frankie-A.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.845
Not sure
if it's a person or a group.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
But they posted this other one
that's pretty funny.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.983
All these Navy dudes
come out of their houses,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.218
and the tires on their cars
are just gone.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.120
Hysterical.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.456
Hey, um, I'm gonna need you
to send me those videos.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.026
Okay.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.202
Sorry. Did I wake you?

10:35.302 --> 10:38.105
It's okay. Can't sleep?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.807
Oh. Might be the sound

10:39.907 --> 10:41.975
of my career going down
the drain that's keeping me up.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.112
As long as you're not putting
too much pressure on yourself.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.116
Hey, thought you got Kenny
to set the meet.

10:49.216 --> 10:54.021
Well, I did after a lot
of arm-twisting.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.858
But Curtis wants to meet
with him tomorrow.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.760
I think
he's losing faith in me.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.895
Kate, you're, like,
his best agent.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.731
Then why can't I keep Kenny
in line?
You will.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.465
Things go sideways
on all of us sometimes.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.467
I'm just used to being...

11:07.567 --> 11:10.871
better at things
than everyone else.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.842
I bet you freaked out

11:14.942 --> 11:16.509
every time
you got a B on a test.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.546
I never got a B. Hmm.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.249
Oh.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.387
What's up, Kenny?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.822
Katie!

11:28.922 --> 11:30.623
You should be here.
The DJ is dope!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.860
Uh, not in the mood
for a dope DJ.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.829
What do you need? There
a problem with the meet?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.430
Yeah, my money's
the problem, Katie.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.866
I can't just let
those guys get away

11:38.966 --> 11:40.533
without paying what they owe.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.601
It's bad business.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.702
It's not business, Kenny.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.371
I told you. It's a sting...

11:44.471 --> 11:45.906
But it's my money!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.474
From the commission of a crime.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.642
Yeah. Look,
I called off the meet.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.411
Kenny, no, that's not the plan.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.714
They're not getting a thing
from me until I see some green.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.151
Trust me. It's the right move
here. I got go.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.424
You have something uplifting
and encouraging to say now?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.127
I got nothing.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.431
<i>Any luck on the videos I sent?</i>

12:11.531 --> 12:15.235
Have to admit, I was a little
surprised you found these.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.670
Because I'm too old for RushCut?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.807
I refuse to answer that
on the grounds

12:19.907 --> 12:22.042
that it may incriminate me. Smart.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.476
Alex showed me.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.278
Also said I wasn't allowed
to get my own account.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.915
Mm. Doesn't want you to see
what he and his friends post?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.582
Which makes me only want
to see even more.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.084
I used to know everything
about this kid.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.685
Now, I don't even know
his first-choice college.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.021
Oh, it'll get worse.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.857
After he leaves,
you'll be completely shut out.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.360
Did I say that out loud?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.529
Well, Frankie-A's been busy.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.264
We found posts
on all the thefts

12:44.364 --> 12:46.566
that Ernie identified,
plus a few others.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.668
All right, show me. Okay.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.437
He started small.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.972
Fairly innocent pranks.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.974
Other than the whole
breaking-and-entering thing.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.343
Why spoons?
'Cause it's funny.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.279
I mean, not to me, of course.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.748
But then, the thefts changed,
seemed to get more personal.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.783
The golf trophies
were all taken

13:03.884 --> 13:05.185
from private country clubs.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.354
Hashtagged
"rich-people-problems."

13:07.454 --> 13:09.990
And the post with the stolen
tires slams military officers.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.892
Sounds like someone
has a problem with authority.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.460
Well, the thefts
are evolving.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.462
And becoming
more sophisticated.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.997
Getting onto base,

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
hacking personal
security cams takes skill.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.501
All right, well, any luck
tracking down Frankie-A?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.770
No, RushCut accounts
are anonymous.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.605
Frankie-A could be anybody.

13:25.705 --> 13:29.409
I think it's a reference
to Frank Abagnale.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.144
The <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> guy?

13:31.244 --> 13:34.414
I don't think this is
quite at his level.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.050
And Frankie-A doesn't seem
to be in it for the money.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.086
Not yet, anyway.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.021
Keep digging.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.896
Hey, Boom-Boom. I got your text.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.498
You said you found something?

13:51.598 --> 13:52.933
I look like Boom-Boom to you?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.834
Hey, Bam Bam. I'm sorry.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.769
I don't mistake you
for Boone or Tennant.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.305
I didn't see you.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.907
Even though I'm standing
right in front of you?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.875
Uh...
What's going on?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.376
Holman thinks we look alike.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.377
I really don't.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.712
I don't.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.080
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.016
And we can move on.
Yes, please. Thank you.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.118
I... I got your text.
You said you had a lead?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.120
Yeah. Been examining
the device

14:13.220 --> 14:14.754
that set off
the elephant toothpaste.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.489
It's pretty impressive, actually.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.691
Small explosive set off
by a remote detonator,

14:18.791 --> 14:20.227
probably from a cell phone.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.594
Like a bomb?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.163
Yeah, only this one
isn't dangerous.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.965
Just strong enough to break
the bottom of some tubes

14:25.065 --> 14:26.499
and allow the chemicals to mix.

14:26.599 --> 14:30.971
Um, how exactly
is this stuff made?

14:31.838 --> 14:34.507
Skipped that day
of seventh grade science, huh?

14:34.607 --> 14:35.708
It's pretty easy.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.244
Concentrated hydrogen peroxide,

14:37.344 --> 14:38.979
potassium chloride
as a catalyst.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.513
You know what a catalyst is, right?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.349
Makes it go boom?
Close enough.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.251
Then you add soap,
food coloring

14:44.351 --> 14:46.753
and baking yeast.
Lots of baking yeast
in this case.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.555
I did some digging.
Turns out,

14:48.655 --> 14:51.491
the commissary here sold
over 100 bags of it last week.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.793
To one person?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.930
BOOM-BOOM:
Lieutenant Commander
William Morrison.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.632
Navy pilot.
Lives on base.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.634
This is great.
Thank you, Boom-Boom.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.170
I'm Boom-Boom.
She's Bam Bam.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.705
Isn't that what I said? I...
I don't know.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.140
Is it?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.341
Uh, I'm...

15:09.476 --> 15:12.045
Great work, both of you.
Thank you.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.614
Sorry.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.149
He's fun to mess with.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.485
Always brings sunshine
to my day.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.088
<i>Katie,</i>

15:21.188 --> 15:22.722
I-I know you're pissed, but...

15:22.822 --> 15:25.092
What's going on? Who...?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.726
Who is this?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.061
My colleague,
Special Agent Curtis.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.130
We agreed
I would only talk to you.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.232
You also agreed to set a meet,
which you cancelled.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.501
So let's not worry
about agreements right now.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.869
You've been giving
Agent Whistler the runaround.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.171
Is that what you told him?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.806
Kenny, we just really
need you to...

15:39.906 --> 15:41.808
Shut up and listen is
what we need, Kenny.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.376
Or you can leave here in cuffs.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.777
All right?

15:44.877 --> 15:46.013
Special Agent Whistler
caught you

15:46.113 --> 15:47.380
with the burner phones
and drugs.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.449
If we can't get the guards,
we get you.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.651
Is that simple enough
to understand?

15:51.751 --> 15:54.287
I have been helping.
Not enough.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.924
You make sure the meet is
back on, or I'll make sure

15:58.025 --> 15:59.993
you don't see the light of day
for ten years.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.298
Katie...

16:06.099 --> 16:10.170
Just do what he said,
Kenny, okay?

16:23.350 --> 16:25.985
Lieutenant Commander Morrison
co-pilots a C-2 Greyhound.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.788
He runs supplies and cargo
to aircraft carriers.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.091
That's him.
Doesn't look
like a guy

16:31.191 --> 16:33.493
that spends a lot
of time on RushCut.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.064
Commander Morrison, I'm NCIS
Special Agent Jane Tennant,

16:37.164 --> 16:39.999
this is Special Agent Boone.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.601
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.935
Sure. What about?

16:43.036 --> 16:45.672
Maybe we can start
with, uh, golf trophies.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.874
Uh, okay. I... I don't play.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.342
We're investigating

16:49.442 --> 16:52.545
a series of thefts,
and your name came up.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.780
Somebody stole golf trophies?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.014
Not only trophies,

16:55.115 --> 16:57.217
but tires and mannequins

16:57.317 --> 16:59.652
and, uh... spoons. Mm.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.290
Do you hear the words that are
coming out of your mouth?

17:06.359 --> 17:10.029
Have you recently purchased a
large quantity of baking yeast?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.798
I barely even cook.

17:11.898 --> 17:15.568
And I just got back last night
from a run to the USS <i>Nimitz.</i>

17:15.668 --> 17:16.969
What's in here?

17:17.070 --> 17:18.571
My camper van.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.407
I mean,
not that I ever get to use it.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.409
Look, be honest, okay?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.611
Did the guys from the squadron
put you up to this?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.413
We're gonna need to take a look.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.682
Sure. No problem.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.118
Here you go.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.086
As you can plainly see,

17:33.186 --> 17:34.887
I got nothing to hide.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.962
Trophies, tires,
spoons and mannequins.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.633
Can you explain
how all this ended up here?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.067
I don't know.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.036
Somebody must've put it there
while I was gone.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.638
Who else has access?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.674
Nobody.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.410
I hope
I don't need to remind you

17:57.510 --> 18:00.480
that keeping things from us
is an offense in and of itself.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.952
My son. Robbie.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.987
17 and too damn smart
for his own good.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.823
Okay, well,
where is Robbie now?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.625
I haven't seen him
since I got back.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.627
My camper van's gone, too.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.629
Why the hell would he do this?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.272
Hard to believe

18:25.372 --> 18:27.374
a teenager committed
all these crazy thefts.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.376
Yeah. Kid's super intelligent,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.077
but he's been
in trouble before.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.612
Got kicked out
of three schools in Arizona,

18:32.712 --> 18:34.481
and had to come
live here with his dad.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.082
What'd he do?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.785
Most recently? He hacked
his school's computer network.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.620
Changing test scores?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.055
Adding Christmas bonuses
to janitorial staff.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.558
Makes me kind of like him.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.959
Yeah.
Cute.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.095
Okay, GPS on Morrison's
camper van says

18:49.196 --> 18:51.063
it should be
right around here.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.967
All right, let's try
not to spook him.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.972
NCIS!

19:01.874 --> 19:04.644
Oh, my gosh.
You're not Robbie.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.315
No, you're not, little guy.
You're not Robbie at all, huh?

19:08.415 --> 19:11.083
Hey, Luce, I got him. Robbie?

19:11.184 --> 19:12.652
Robbie Morrison! NCIS!

19:12.752 --> 19:15.455
You stay here, buddy, okay?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.961
Robbie, stop!

19:22.762 --> 19:24.397
Robbie.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.334
You got your pick?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.101
Yeah.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.471
Think we'd better hurry. Yeah.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.739
Okay, got it.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.678
Hey! Hey, get back here!

19:45.218 --> 19:46.986
Got to give him credit.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.322
Pretty impressive getaway.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.100
Hey. Still no sign of Robbie?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.503
No, but Jesse and Kai found the
plane he stole at Dillingham.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.072
Was anyone hurt?
Looked like he landed safely.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.341
He's lucky.
Even left some cash for gas.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.543
Morrison confirmed that Robbie's
been taking flying lessons

20:10.643 --> 20:12.379
the last few years.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.080
Following
in his dad's footsteps.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.249
Or trying to fly the nest. Literally.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.984
Morrison said that
there's been a lot of tension

20:18.084 --> 20:20.119
between them
since he and his wife divorced.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.188
This kind of tension could
get him or someone else killed.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.591
Which is why we need to find him
before that happens.

20:24.691 --> 20:25.992
Any luck tracking his phone?

20:26.092 --> 20:28.495
No. He probably changed
his SIM card.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.632
I'm sorry. Do we have a visitor?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.667
Yeah, he's vicious.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.202
Until you rub his belly.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.838
Oh. Hey, if you end up
adopting that little guy,

20:38.938 --> 20:41.173
we'll have a playdate
with him and Pepper.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.642
Not happening.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.911
Puppies are cute,
but they grow up to be dogs.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.046
I'll drop him off
at Morrison's later.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.149
You have something
for us, Ernie?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.952
Yeah, I was digging into
Robbie's social media profile.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.888
The one for Frankie-A?
No, for Robbie himself.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.625
Frankie-A's pranks target
mostly authority figures.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.994
But on his personal posts,
Robbie is more of a crusader.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.331
He's always supporting
the underdog and getting into

21:04.431 --> 21:07.099
some heated exchanges.
It's pretty wide-range, too.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.936
Protecting the environment,
social issues, animal rights.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.438
Underpaid janitorial workers.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.073
Exactly. Almost feels like
he's looking for a fight.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.609
Anything that might
help us track him down?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.611
Not yet, but I made
a contact list--

21:18.711 --> 21:20.179
anyone he might reach out to.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.214
Good. I'll get Jesse and Kai
to keep an eye out

21:22.315 --> 21:24.016
for the father
in case Robbie reaches out.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.552
Okay. Hi.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.324
Hey, Kate, everything all right?

21:31.424 --> 21:34.394
I don't know.
Meet's officially back on.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.562
Set for tomorrow night.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.996
That sounds all right.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.898
Yeah, but I'm worried
it's gonna fall apart.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.600
Kenny was so upset.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.101
I don't know
if we can count on him.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.471
Did you tell ASAC Curtis that?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.706
Well, I don't want him to feel
like I'm undermining him.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.708
His instincts
are probably right here.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.209
Doesn't sound like

21:50.309 --> 21:52.211
<i>you</i> believe that,
even a little bit.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, I don't know
what I believe.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.582
Stop second-guessing
<i>your</i> instincts, Kate.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.116
That's not you.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.386
You break murderers
for breakfast.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.422
Terrorists for lunch and
kingpins for a midday snack.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.324
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a badass.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.460
I got to go.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.961
Bye.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.798
Everything's set
for tomorrow night.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.833
I've alerted the team.
Oh, good.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.668
I knew Kenny'd
come through.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.103
Well, he almost didn't.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.639
He tried to back out
of his CI agreement.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.375
That's not unusual.
They scare easy.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.977
Sure.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.180
Is there something else?

22:29.982 --> 22:32.351
Uh, yes, sir, there is.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.522
You agreed to trust me
to handle Kenny up until now.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.991
Why didn't you trust me
enough to see this through?

22:39.091 --> 22:41.728
To be honest, you didn't
exactly inspire confidence.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.398
Well, I assure you, I've had the
situation fully under control.

22:45.498 --> 22:49.436
Look, I was only trying to
protect you and this operation.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.438
Well, with all
due respect,

22:51.538 --> 22:53.873
I don't need protecting.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.343
All right, then.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.045
Kenny's all yours.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.347
Make some magic happen tomorrow.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.483
Thank you, sir.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.790
Kate Whistler.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.792
What? No. No.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.128
Don't-don't do anything.
I'm on my way.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.766
I'm not sure following
Morrison's gonna do

23:19.866 --> 23:21.400
much good.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.802
Well, his son's a fugitive.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.804
Don't you think
he'll want to make contact?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.338
I mean, I think he's got
as little idea

23:26.439 --> 23:28.941
what's going on
with Robbie as we do.

23:30.810 --> 23:34.380
There he comes.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.715
What's this now?

23:35.815 --> 23:37.249
Hey.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.185
Can I help you, man?

23:41.754 --> 23:42.989
Hey!

23:43.089 --> 23:44.423
Federal agents!
Back off!

23:45.825 --> 23:47.259
Hey!

23:48.327 --> 23:50.830
Stop! Hey, stop!

23:53.600 --> 23:56.836
Hey. Hey, Commander Morrison?

23:58.471 --> 24:02.008
Yeah. This is Special Agent
Jesse Boone, NCIS.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.044
I need an ambulance
at 1070 King Street right away.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.421
Oh, there she is.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.423
You're about to find out
what a huge mistake you've made.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.758
Officer Martinez?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.459
I'm Agent Whistler.
Thank you for calling.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.529
Loudmouth here says
he works for you.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.096
Claims he's deputized.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.365
Tell her, Katie.
Tell her how important I am.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.167
Stop talking.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.737
What exactly happened here?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.539
Neighbor reported
suspicious activity.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.041
Like he was casing the house
up the street, trying to get in.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.977
Which I explained was part
of a top secret operation.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.179
When I approached him,
he tried to run.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.881
I had to chase him
down, detain him.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.550
He hasn't shut up since.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.921
It's true. Kenny is assisting
on an investigation.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.723
And I appreciate everything
you've done, but

24:50.823 --> 24:52.559
I can take it from here.
You sure?

24:52.659 --> 24:54.661
Little time behind bars
might do this jerk some good.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.362
Yeah, I couldn't agree more,

24:56.462 --> 24:59.398
but I got it,
if that's okay with you.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.804
Yeah.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.939
Sorry for the misunderstanding, Officer.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.408
FBI values your service.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.244
Just don't.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.414
Devon Gage's house?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.684
Really? One of the targets
of our investigation?

25:17.784 --> 25:19.485
I know where
he hides his cash.

25:19.586 --> 25:22.221
I figured I'd make myself whole
since you won't lift a finger.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.056
So you were gonna rob him?!

25:24.156 --> 25:25.457
What's wrong with you?

25:25.558 --> 25:27.426
This operation took months
to put together,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.662
and you're about to blow it
over a couple thousand dollars?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.097
Get locked up?

25:31.197 --> 25:33.332
You know what? Set up the meet
your damn selves.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.001
I'm done.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.544
Hey.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.013
Hey.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.715
How's he doing?

25:48.815 --> 25:50.917
Two skull fractures.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.252
They're keeping him
under because

25:53.352 --> 25:54.887
of some swelling
on the brain.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.488
And the suspect?

25:56.589 --> 25:58.524
We looked through security
footage for the vehicle,

25:58.625 --> 26:01.227
but there's no good angle,
and the plates were covered.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.530
So it was premeditated.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.833
It's got to be connected

26:06.933 --> 26:08.434
to Robbie's thefts, right?
I guess.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.637
He didn't really steal
anything of value.

26:10.737 --> 26:14.040
We're missing a piece
only Robbie can fill in.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.743
Kid's got no idea
his dad's in the hospital,

26:16.843 --> 26:18.645
and we got no way
of reaching him.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.514
Actually, we do.

26:23.716 --> 26:27.453
Hey, Ernie, I need you
to do something.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.207
Dad!

26:50.743 --> 26:53.880
Hello, Robbie.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.415
We were hoping you'd show up.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.327
You've been busy.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.062
You tricked me, huh?

27:10.162 --> 27:12.431
Posted that video of my dad
getting hurt on RushCut?

27:12.531 --> 27:14.066
Had a feeling you'd see it.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.534
Wasn't a trick, Robbie.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.570
Your dad's in pretty bad shape.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.807
Is he gonna be okay?

27:20.907 --> 27:22.408
Doctors hope so.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.976
I was just messing around.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.644
Yeah, well,
someone took it personal.

27:25.745 --> 27:29.281
It was just funny videos.
They're crimes, Robbie.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.320
Your dad mentioned that
you'd had some difficulties

27:34.420 --> 27:36.088
with your mom in Arizona.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.191
Her boyfriend and I
didn't get along.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.527
She chose him.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.996
That's hard.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.865
Yeah, well,
Arizona sucks, anyway.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.936
So you move in with your dad?

27:50.036 --> 27:52.538
Yeah, he wasn't expecting that.
He's gone a lot.

27:52.638 --> 27:53.973
But it doesn't matter.
I'm fine.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.407
What you've been doing
isn't fine.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.408
Nobody was getting hurt.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.510
Can't say that anymore.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.013
Look, whoever did this to your
dad could be looking for you.

28:01.113 --> 28:04.283
I'm gonna need a list of every
theft you've committed, Robbie,

28:04.383 --> 28:05.752
no matter how small.

28:05.852 --> 28:09.321
You've got to find
whoever did this.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.191
He needs to pay.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.664
Just...

28:18.765 --> 28:21.233
call me back, okay?
We need to talk.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.935
Please, Kenny.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.703
Hey!

28:24.804 --> 28:27.439
Everything okay, Kate?

28:27.539 --> 28:30.376
Well, I was hoping we could
talk, but if you're busy...

28:30.476 --> 28:33.079
No. Let's talk.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.982
The case I'm working on
got me rattled.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.516
It just feels like
I don't know what I'm doing.

28:37.616 --> 28:38.985
This is the CI?

28:39.085 --> 28:41.020
He's impossible,
completely undependable.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.022
Says he'll cooperate,
changes his mind.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.792
Get him back in line,
he does it all over again.

28:45.892 --> 28:49.028
How do I...
<i>make</i> him get in line?

28:49.128 --> 28:52.564
Well, you may not be able
to <i>make</i> him do anything.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.700
What? So I just give up?

28:54.801 --> 28:56.068
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.437
You can't <i>make</i> him cooperate.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.006
You're gonna have
to convince him.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.609
All right, what does he want?

29:03.709 --> 29:05.644
Well, to stay out of jail,
I assume.

29:05.744 --> 29:10.016
Well, that's logical, but most
criminals don't think logically.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.618
Doesn't not going to jail
make sense to everybody?

29:14.653 --> 29:16.522
I've handled a lot of CIs.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.557
Every one of them is different.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.560
They're people, not tools.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.363
You're gonna have
to get to know them.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.398
Figure out
what motivates them.

29:26.498 --> 29:31.003
Is it money? Fear? Love?

29:31.804 --> 29:34.573
You're saying
I need to get inside his head

29:34.673 --> 29:36.575
and figure out
what makes him tick.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.144
And use it to convince him

29:38.244 --> 29:40.913
that cooperating is
what <i>he</i> wants.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.416
Good luck.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.058
Hey.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.460
Ah. Still puppy-sitting.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.829
He's a very good helper.
Yeah?

29:56.929 --> 29:58.831
Well, has he helped you identify
Morrison's assailant yet?

29:58.931 --> 30:00.266
Sadly,

30:00.366 --> 30:03.102
no, but we've gone
through the list of thefts

30:03.202 --> 30:04.736
that Robbie gave you. Housewives,

30:04.837 --> 30:07.139
senior military officers, golfers.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.708
No criminal records
or history of violence.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.410
Maybe he left some out?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.581
Strange. He doesn't have
any collar or tags.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.648
And there were no toys
or dog food

30:16.748 --> 30:18.150
at the Morrisons' house, either.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.919
Well, I'm pretty sure
the puppy isn't a suspect.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.388
No, but how did Robbie get him?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.656
Maybe it's not Robbie's dog.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.625
Let's find out.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.227
Robbie's
at Juvenile Detention.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.262
Let's give 'em a call.
Wait, wait.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.264
Oh, this sounds like the spark
of genius igniting.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.566
I like how you put things.
Thank you.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.835
This attack might not be the
result of Frankie-A's thefts,

30:36.936 --> 30:38.837
but because of Robbie's
real-life account.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.339
You said he was involved
with a lot of causes

30:40.439 --> 30:41.640
and had some heated exchanges.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.442
One of them was
with a guy suspected

30:43.542 --> 30:46.445
of breeding fighting dogs--
Nico Androv.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.847
Androv's pretty blatant about
what he does with these dogs.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.516
Well, dogfighting's illegal.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.151
Well, here, but not abroad.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.552
They code.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.288
Like, they call a big dogfight
a "convention."

30:56.388 --> 30:58.657
A "champion" is a dog
that's won three fights.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.459
Authorities haven't
shut him down?

31:00.559 --> 31:02.661
None of the fights take place
on U.S. soil.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.131
He trains them, ships them off.

31:07.666 --> 31:08.767
Dogs aren't
born violent.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.269
The breeders make them that way.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.339
And Robbie always champions
the underdog.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.108
That little guy might be
worth ten grand

31:16.208 --> 31:18.044
if he's from a champion line.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.779
If Robbie took a whole litter,
no wonder Androv's pissed.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.114
Send Androv's picture
to Jesse and Kai,

31:22.214 --> 31:23.950
see if they recognize him.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.952
Robbie's gone.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.453
Gone where?
No one knows.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.188
He disappeared
from the detention facility.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.190
At the hospital, Robbie said

31:31.290 --> 31:34.026
whoever attacked his father
was gonna pay.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.062
He already knew who it was.

31:36.162 --> 31:38.797
He's going after Androv.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.142
Thanks for meeting me, Kenny.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.743
I don't want to fight, Katie.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.079
Do what you got to do.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.580
I'm not changing my mind.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.218
Hey, I get it. You got
to make your own choices.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.620
I'm just here
'cause I love the water.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.123
I'm most relaxed when
I'm out on the waves surfing.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.525
You surf?
Yeah, as much as I can.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.529
There's a lot
you don't know about me.

32:10.629 --> 32:15.001
And there is a lot
I don't know about you, either.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.103
Like what?
Your real name

32:17.203 --> 32:19.071
is Kenneth Abramowitz,
not Kenny Sparks.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.607
It's in my record.
Yeah, I know it.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.809
But I didn't know
that Kenneth Abramowitz applied

32:23.909 --> 32:25.677
to join the sheriff's department
back in Ventura,

32:25.777 --> 32:27.079
where you're from.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.448
I got rejected. Twice.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.917
Said I wasn't fit.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.254
Must've hurt.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.691
Especially with your father
and older brother both cops.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.129
I was never good enough
for them,

32:43.229 --> 32:45.864
and man,
would they let everyone know.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.767
But Kenny,

32:48.867 --> 32:52.338
you got a chance here to show
everyone how good you are.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.974
By getting pinched by the FBI
and forced to cooperate?

32:56.075 --> 32:58.077
No one's forcing you.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.746
You made
some really bad choices,

33:00.846 --> 33:03.815
but you can start
making good ones.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.885
It's up to you.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.921
And my money?

33:10.022 --> 33:11.923
This was never
about the money, Kenny.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.460
'Cause you know
we'd never let you keep it.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.365
It's about respect.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.734
Yeah?

33:22.834 --> 33:23.969
Those guys took advantage
of you.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.504
Same way
they're taking advantage

33:25.604 --> 33:26.972
of their power as guards.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.308
But you can help stop them.

33:31.577 --> 33:35.047
I'm giving you the opportunity
to earn some respect.

33:36.882 --> 33:39.218
It's up to you to take it.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.964
Oh, watch out!

33:54.466 --> 33:56.868
Guess this is the place.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.105
Yeah, looks like
Robbie's already here.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.440
He must be freeing
Androv's dogs.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.343
Vests aren't gonna help much
if one of these dogs attacks.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.612
Oh, great.
Let go!

34:06.712 --> 34:08.647
Robbie!
No, wait, please!

34:09.415 --> 34:10.982
Get in there!

34:13.852 --> 34:15.821
Let's see how much
of a smart-ass you are now!

34:18.857 --> 34:21.093
Help!

34:27.566 --> 34:30.202
NCIS!
Get Androv.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.174
Hey, hey. It's okay.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.389
You're under arrest, scumbag!

34:50.489 --> 34:52.090
Hey, hey.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.461
Easy.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.962
Climb over the fence. Go.

34:57.062 --> 35:00.899
It's okay. Good boy.
There you go.

35:00.999 --> 35:04.536
You're a good boy, aren't you?

35:04.636 --> 35:06.638
We're gonna find you
a new home, okay?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.375
That's a promise.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.813
You okay?

35:14.913 --> 35:18.617
Yeah, but if you hadn't come...

35:18.717 --> 35:21.720
Hey, hey, it's over now.
You're safe, okay?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.055
You're safe. Come on.
All right.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.199
You sure
he'll hold it together?

35:33.299 --> 35:35.201
Don't worry.
Kenny's solid.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.242
Okay, here we go.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.876
Come on, Kenny.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.780
Sparks.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.682
Wasn't sure
you'd show up.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.351
I almost didn't.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.985
You seem jumpy tonight.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.622
Yeah? 'Cause you guys owe me.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.490
I was worried
you'd pull another fast one.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.558
Is that all it is?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.293
Show me the money,

36:01.393 --> 36:03.094
I'll be totally chill.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.696
Merchandise first.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.033
This bunch is even better.

36:09.468 --> 36:12.604
I've got burner phones in books,

36:12.704 --> 36:16.675
and toothpaste
with high-grade weed.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.778
And ecstasy disguised
as aspirin.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.313
Impressive.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.748
Come on, get the money.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.250
It's all going home with me.

36:26.252 --> 36:28.354
If I don't see some cash.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.266
It's all there.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.934
That's all we need.
Move in! Move in!

36:43.735 --> 36:45.704
Nice work, Agent.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.108
Federal agents!

36:50.208 --> 36:51.577
FBI! Don't move!

36:51.677 --> 36:53.211
Hands up!

37:03.289 --> 37:04.590
I'm sorry, Dad.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.693
Yeah. Me, too.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.530
I'm just glad you're okay.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.131
You know, for a smart kid,

37:13.231 --> 37:16.835
confronting Androv alone
was a dumb choice.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.571
Those dogs didn't
have any choice.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.006
But you're right.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.343
So, you're taking me back
to juvie?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.845
Just to pick up your stuff.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.284
There may be
a better way for you

37:32.384 --> 37:35.354
to make restitution
for your crimes.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.661
So you're the kid that
messed up my van, huh?

37:42.761 --> 37:46.264
Uh... yeah.
I'm real sorry about that.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.799
Well, that was a real
pain-in-the-ass move.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.501
You know that, right?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.303
Kind of cool, though.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.575
I hear you got some talent
with computers.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.110
Yeah, I guess so.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.812
Well, it might be
a win for everyone

38:00.912 --> 38:02.981
if you put your talents
to more productive use.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.650
We work with kids
on the island, teaching

38:04.750 --> 38:06.284
science and coding.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.987
Deal is, you do your community
service hours with us.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.657
Stay out of trouble, listen
to everything we tell you.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.992
Your record gets clean.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.228
Lot more fun <i>fighting</i> crime
than committing it.

38:17.329 --> 38:18.997
What do you say?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.402
Yeah.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.045
Hey. Hope you ate.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.648
There were some leftovers
in the fridge.

38:36.748 --> 38:40.218
Yeah. Um, I wasn't hungry.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.091
Is everything okay?

38:46.191 --> 38:47.893
I don't know.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.262
I heard from
my first-choice school.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.832
Oh, baby.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.067
Hey, I'm sorry.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.671
But you got into those other
schools, so you have choices.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.874
No, Mom.
That's... that's not it.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.846
I got in.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.316
Oh, my God.
What? This is great!
Yeah.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.452
That's amazing. All right,
do I get to know

39:13.552 --> 39:15.521
what school it is now?

39:15.621 --> 39:18.156
I got into
the U.S. Naval Academy.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.361
I'm going to Annapolis.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.903
Sounds like the operation
couldn't have gone any better.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.972
So, how'd you get Kenny
to come around?

39:34.072 --> 39:37.042
I took Tennant's advice.
Figured out what makes him tick.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.944
Loud techno and go-go dancers?

39:39.044 --> 39:40.979
A little respect. And really,

39:41.079 --> 39:43.348
well, just to feel good
about himself.

39:43.449 --> 39:46.918
Well, guess you two
aren't that different.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.090
Hey, thank you
for putting up with me.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.660
I find you very easy
to put up with.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.496
How did I get through
all those months with you away?

39:57.596 --> 39:58.930
No idea.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.032
I am pretty awesome. Yes.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.868
Yes, you are.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.004
No.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.574
Sorry.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.008
I will get rid of him.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.143
Katie!

40:12.243 --> 40:14.746
I told you not to call
unless it was an emergency.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.214
It's a total emergency.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.450
I got a big lead, partner.
Wait till you hear.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.519
We're not partners.
Kenny?

40:20.619 --> 40:21.887
Hold on. I'll be right there.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.022
It's the scoop
of the year, Katie.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.492
Get ready for what Kenny Sparks
got for you, baby.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.827
Right?
