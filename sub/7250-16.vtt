00:14.139 --> 00:16.183
I'LL GET 'EM LATER.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.601
GET 'EM NOW.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.601
WHY?

00:17.643 --> 00:19.436
BECAUSE IF YOUR HARVARD

00:17.643 --> 00:19.436
ACCEPTANCE LETTER'S IN

00:19.478 --> 00:20.855
AND YOU DON'T HAVE SHOES ON

00:20.896 --> 00:22.690
WE CAN'T RUN OFF

00:20.896 --> 00:22.690
IMMEDIATELY AND CELEBRATE.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.733
ALL OF OUR HAPPINESS

00:22.731 --> 00:24.733
WILL BE ON HOLD

00:24.775 --> 00:26.568
UNTIL YOU COME BACK

00:24.775 --> 00:26.568
AND WEAR SHOES.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.403
YOU WANNA PUT A HOLD

00:26.610 --> 00:28.403
ON HAPPINESS?

00:28.445 --> 00:30.865
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:28.445 --> 00:30.865
IF WE WAIT THEN OR NOW?

00:30.906 --> 00:33.367
WE'RE NOT HAPPY NOW.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.367
RIGHT. OKAY.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.912
NO LACING --

00:33.408 --> 00:36.912
JUST GET 'EM ON YOUR FEET.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.539
LET'S GO!

00:42.167 --> 00:43.168
KIRK!

00:43.210 --> 00:44.628
GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.255
IS THERE AN ENVELOPE?

00:44.670 --> 00:47.255
BIG ONE? NOT A LITTLE ONE.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.507
YEAH, BIG MEANS SHE'S IN.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.342
IF LITTLE,

00:48.549 --> 00:50.342
SHE NEEDS TO MARRY RICH.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.219
JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.929
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO

00:52.260 --> 00:53.929
SORT 'EM EARLIER?

00:53.971 --> 00:56.765
PERSONALLY, I THINK IT TAKES

00:53.971 --> 00:56.765
THE SPONTANEITY OUT OF THE JOB.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.351
NEED SOME HELP?

00:56.807 --> 00:59.351
FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS IT.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.978
ANY CHANCE

00:59.393 --> 01:00.978
YOU COULD GO FASTER?

01:01.020 --> 01:03.939
YOU GOT A GIRL'S FUTURE IN

01:01.020 --> 01:03.939
THAT SACK OF YOURS...SANTA.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.524
THANK YOU FOR

01:03.981 --> 01:05.524
ADDING THE "SANTA."

01:05.566 --> 01:09.236
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE NOTICED?

01:05.566 --> 01:09.236
A MAIL WITH OUR NAMES ON IT?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.112
I'VE NOTICED, PEOPLE DON'T

01:09.277 --> 01:11.112
SLOW DOWN ANYMORE.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.740
I'VE GOT TIME TO

01:11.154 --> 01:12.740
TIE MY SHOES.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.200
YES, COBBLE YOURSELF

01:12.781 --> 01:15.200
A NEW PAIR, DANIEL DAY-LEWIS.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.244
NO ONE STOPS

01:15.242 --> 01:17.244
TO SMELL A NICE FLOWER

01:17.285 --> 01:18.787
OR LOOK AT A PUPPY.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.955
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.790
NO ONE STOPS TO ASK

01:19.997 --> 01:21.790
HOW YOU'RE DOING,

01:21.832 --> 01:24.626
IS YOUR FAMILY WELL? DID YOU

01:21.832 --> 01:24.626
SEE THAT GAME LAST NIGHT?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.085
PEOPLE SUCK.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.085
IS THAT OURS?

01:26.127 --> 01:28.087
WHAT? OH...

01:26.127 --> 01:28.087
"MRS. RITA FLORA." NOPE.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.715
RATS!

01:28.129 --> 01:29.715
IT COULD STILL BE THERE.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.799
DIDN'T RITA FLORA DIE?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.551
WHILE YOU WERE DELIVERING

01:30.841 --> 01:32.551
HER MAIL?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.386
SHE DID DIE.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.386
SHE DIED LAST WEEK.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.222
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT YOUR

01:34.428 --> 01:37.222
MAIL ON HOLD WHEN YOU DIE.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.849
LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.849
AND THE ENVELOPE?

01:38.891 --> 01:41.685

02:46.000 --> 02:48.335
YOU'VE EVER NOTICED.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.169

02:48.376 --> 02:50.169

02:50.211 --> 02:52.380

02:53.841 --> 02:55.634
I'M NOT CRABBY.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.634
I'M VERY, VERY ILL.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.344
ALLERGIES.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.344
<i>DEADLY</i> ALLERGIES.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.638
SHOULD WE MAKE FUNERAL

02:57.385 --> 02:59.638
ARRANGEMENTS NOW?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.891
BE SURE YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK

02:59.680 --> 03:02.891
IN CASE THIS STUFF WORKS.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.183
WHERE DID

03:02.933 --> 03:04.183
YOU GET THOSE?

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
IN YOUR ROOM.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
THESE EXPIRED IN '98.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.521
SO I SHOULD TAKE 4?

03:07.562 --> 03:08.563
THAT'S EXACTLY

03:07.562 --> 03:08.563
MY POINT.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.525
HERE, NEW MENUS!

03:08.605 --> 03:11.525
VERY FANCY!

03:11.566 --> 03:13.485
WHY'D NEW MENUS?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.485
IT WAS TIME.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.945
BUT I HAD MADE LITTLE DOODLES

03:14.987 --> 03:17.865
WITH MY NAME HIDDEN IN THEM

03:14.987 --> 03:17.865
ON EACH ONE.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.033
SORRY.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.868
IT TOOK ME YEARS

03:19.074 --> 03:20.868
TO HIT EVERY MENU.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.786
THESE HAVE SUPER-HEAVY

03:20.909 --> 03:22.786
PLASTIC OVER THEM.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.915
THE SUPER-HEAVY PLASTIC

03:22.828 --> 03:26.915
IS THERE TO DISCOURAGE DOODLING.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.792
THIS LOOKS DIFFERENT.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.792
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.502
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.502
NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.587
THERE ARE MORE SALADS.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.587
THREE MORE SALADS.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.256
WHO NEEDS THREE MORE SALADS?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.256
ONE WAS ENOUGH.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.885
NICOLE SAID THERE WASN'T

03:35.298 --> 03:37.885
THAT MUCH FOR HER TO EAT

03:37.926 --> 03:39.678
ON THE MENU, SO I JUST --

03:39.720 --> 03:42.014
YOU ADDED THREE SALADS

03:39.720 --> 03:42.014
JUST FOR NICOLE.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.224
WHEN I ASKED YOU TO ADD

03:42.056 --> 03:44.224
CHILI-TOPPED PRINGLES,

03:44.265 --> 03:45.893
YOU SAID NO.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.893
I STAND BY THAT.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.811
NICOLE GETS THREE SALADS,

03:45.934 --> 03:47.811
I GET "NO"?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.396
BECAUSE NICOLE'S

03:47.853 --> 03:49.396
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.898
NICOLE IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.941
NICOLE IS THE WOMAN

03:50.939 --> 03:52.941
I'M DATING, THAT'S IT.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.569
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET

03:52.983 --> 03:55.569
SERIOUS -- PLACE GOES SOY?

03:55.610 --> 03:56.653
JUST ORDER, PLEASE.

03:56.695 --> 03:59.073
THE MONTE CRISTO

03:56.695 --> 03:59.073
SANDWICH'S OFF?

03:59.114 --> 04:00.532
NO!

03:59.114 --> 04:00.532
YOU DID.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.283
YOU TOOK OFF

04:00.574 --> 04:02.283
THE MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.785
I OMITTED

04:02.325 --> 04:03.785
A FEW OBSOLETE DISHES.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.621
I CAN'T BELIEVE NICOLE MADE YOU

04:03.827 --> 04:06.621
TAKE OFF THE MONTE CRISTO.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.831
SHE'S GOT YOU MENU-WHIPPED.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.583
SHE DOES NOT HAVE ME

04:07.873 --> 04:09.583
MENU-WHIPPED.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.585
I TOOK OFF A DISGUSTING,

04:09.624 --> 04:11.585
RIDICULOUS SANDWICH

04:11.626 --> 04:14.213
THAT NO ONE HAS EVER ORDERED,

04:11.626 --> 04:14.213
INCLUDING THE THREE OF YOU.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.049
JUST HAVING IT THERE

04:14.254 --> 04:17.049
MADE US FEEL WE ALWAYS COULD.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.633
IT WAS COMFORTING.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.633
LIKE SOUP.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.762
EXACTLY. IT WAS COMFORTING LIKE

04:18.675 --> 04:21.762
DEEP-FRIED HAM-AND-CHEESE SOUP.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.848
AND EVEN THOUGH I NEVER ORDERED

04:21.803 --> 04:24.848
IT, I TALKED ABOUT ORDERING IT.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.433
HAVEN'T I?

04:24.890 --> 04:26.433
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.060
YOU'VE NOT ONLY

04:26.474 --> 04:28.060
ELIMINATED A SANDWICH,

04:28.102 --> 04:30.270
YOU'VE ELIMINATED

04:28.102 --> 04:30.270
A CONVERSATION PIECE.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.855
NOW WHAT'LL WE

04:30.311 --> 04:31.855
TALK ABOUT?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.398
FINE.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.486
HERE -- OLD MENUS --

04:36.526 --> 04:38.486
EVERYTHING'S THERE.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.614
KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.075
HOW COME EVERYBODY ELSE

04:40.655 --> 04:43.075
GETS A NEW MENU?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.207
I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.042
WELL, I MUST SAY

04:50.249 --> 04:52.042
I'M GLAD TO SEE

04:52.084 --> 04:54.669
THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE

05:16.316 --> 05:18.693

05:18.735 --> 05:19.987
THEIR SPEECH AT THE CEREMONY.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.447
SOME OF YOU MAY BE SAYING

05:20.028 --> 05:22.447
TO YOURSELF,

05:22.489 --> 05:24.074
"I ALREADY TURNED IN

05:22.489 --> 05:24.074

05:24.116 --> 05:26.326

05:24.116 --> 05:26.326

05:26.367 --> 05:29.788
TO GIVE UP A FRIDAY NIGHT

"I CAN'T USE IT FOR MY RESUME.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.041
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?"

05:33.083 --> 05:34.375
WOW. THAT WAS SPOOKY.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.419
YES, THE SPEECH WILL NOT GO

05:56.439 --> 05:58.483
WHERE HE'S JUST COMPLETED

05:56.439 --> 05:58.483
A SUCCESSFUL RUN

05:58.525 --> 06:01.028
OF "INTO THE WOODS."

05:58.525 --> 06:01.028
WELCOME BACK, BRAD.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.030
THANK YOU.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.030
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.405
SIT DOWN, MARY MARTIN.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783
ALRIGHT, EVERYONE, HAVE

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783

06:06.825 --> 06:09.036
I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.746
RORY, HI.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.457
HEY, BRAD.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.457
HOW WAS BROADWAY?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.457
IT WAS GREAT.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.375
BUT NATHAN LANE

06:14.499 --> 06:16.375
IS A VERY BITTER MAN.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.213
EVEN MORE THAN THE ACTUAL

06:16.417 --> 06:19.213
EXPERIENCE OF PERFORMING LIVE,

06:19.254 --> 06:22.299
THE CONFIDENCE IT GIVES YOU IN

06:19.254 --> 06:22.299
EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE --

06:22.341 --> 06:23.800
THAT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.552
YOU DO LOOK RATHER CONFIDENT.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.636
IT'S THE NEW ME.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.471
SO, BRAD, BROADWAY.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.183
I MUST KNOW -- DID YOU

06:28.513 --> 06:31.183
GET TO KEEP YOUR MAKEUP?

06:31.225 --> 06:33.227
WHAT ABOUT YOUR COSTUMES?

06:31.225 --> 06:33.227
'CAUSE THAT SEEMS GREAT.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.062
UNLESS YOU'RE DOING

06:33.268 --> 06:35.062
"LES MIS."

06:33.268 --> 06:35.062
OR "CATS."

06:35.103 --> 06:37.272
OR SPANDEX WITH THE TAIL

06:35.103 --> 06:37.272
AND JAZZ SHOES.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.397
SO, DO YOU?

06:38.439 --> 06:40.234
DO I --

06:38.439 --> 06:40.234
GET TO KEEP THE MAKEUP?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.693
I DIDN'T ASK.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.693
YOU DIDN'T ASK?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.320
HOW DO YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
AND NOT HAVE A PIANO

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
FALL ON YOU?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.990
WELL, I MAKE A LEFT

06:45.404 --> 06:46.990
ON FEDERAL --

06:47.032 --> 06:49.743
BRAD, THAT REALLY

06:47.032 --> 06:49.743
DIDN'T REQUIRE AN ANSWER.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.078
YOU'RE BLOCKING

06:49.784 --> 06:51.078
THE LIST.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.453
WILL WE PLEASE MOVE

06:52.495 --> 06:54.706
SO YOU MAY SIGN UP

06:52.495 --> 06:54.706

06:58.210 --> 07:01.088

07:01.129 --> 07:04.383
PARIS, THIS TIME ONSTAGE HAS

07:01.129 --> 07:04.383

07:04.423 --> 07:06.467
I'M NO LONGER

07:04.423 --> 07:06.467
INTIMIDATED BY YOU.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.971
I'M THRILLED TO HEAR IT,

07:12.057 --> 07:14.642
YOU'RE MY LAST CHANCE

07:12.057 --> 07:14.642
TO TROUNCE YOU AT THIS SCHOOL.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.020
MY DECISION TO DO THIS

07:14.684 --> 07:17.020
DOESN'T DEPEND ON YOU.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.314
IT WON'T BE A TOTALLY

07:17.062 --> 07:19.314
SATISFYING VICTORY

07:19.356 --> 07:22.401
JUST BEATING JEROME ROBBINS AND

07:19.356 --> 07:22.401
THE REST OF THE LOSERS HERE.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.279
I'D REALLY LIKE TO

07:22.442 --> 07:25.279
TAKE YOU DOWN, ALSO.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.781
BOY, SHE<i> IS</i> REALLY UP

07:25.320 --> 07:27.781
ON HER THEATER REFERENCES.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.159
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

07:27.822 --> 07:31.159
I AM BEYOND OFFENDED.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.370
DID YOU TELL THEM

07:31.201 --> 07:33.370
I'M BEYOND OFFENDED?

07:33.412 --> 07:34.955
SENDING MY FOOD BACK?!

07:34.996 --> 07:37.374
THAT'S IT -- GET THEIR NAMES.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.374
THEY'RE NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.418
OKAY.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.418
WAIT -- WHAT

07:37.416 --> 07:39.418

07:39.459 --> 07:41.295
PETRUS BORDEAUX.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.338
HMPH!

07:41.336 --> 07:43.338
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.798
HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:44.839 --> 07:47.592
NO, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE

07:44.839 --> 07:47.592
A BETTER SCREENING SYSTEM

07:47.634 --> 07:49.303
FOR CUSTOMERS HERE.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.303
YES, WE DO.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.846
WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO SCREENING

07:49.344 --> 07:51.846
SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMERS.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.307
THEY SENT IT BACK --

07:51.888 --> 07:53.307
MY FOOD,

07:53.348 --> 07:55.767
MY 4-STAR "YOU HAVEN'T LIVED

07:53.348 --> 07:55.767
TILL YOU'VE EATEN THERE,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.477
SAYS RUTH REICHL" FOOD.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.146
WHAT WAS WRONG?

07:57.518 --> 07:59.146
YOU NAME IT --

07:59.187 --> 08:01.398
TOO SALTY,

07:59.187 --> 08:01.398
TOO HOT, TOO SEWER-Y.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.566
HONEY, CALM DOWN.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.566
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST STUPID.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.279
YES, THEY ARE STUPID, AND STUPID

08:03.608 --> 08:07.279
PEOPLE HAVE STUPID FRIENDS,

08:07.321 --> 08:10.157
AND THEY ALL HAVE TO COME HERE

08:07.321 --> 08:10.157
AND BE STUPID TOGETHER.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.617
DON'T BE MAD AT ME,

08:10.198 --> 08:12.617
BUT I MUST ASK.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.035
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

08:12.659 --> 08:14.035
WITH THE FOOD?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.079
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING

08:14.077 --> 08:16.079
WRONG WITH THE FOOD!

08:16.121 --> 08:18.706
WOULDN'T I KNOW IF SOMETHING

08:16.121 --> 08:18.706
WAS WRONG WITH MY FOOD?

08:18.748 --> 08:21.084
YOU DON'T THINK THAT

08:18.748 --> 08:21.084
I TASTED EVERY LAST DISH

08:21.126 --> 08:24.087
THAT WAS SENT BACK.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.087
I TASTED IT. MANUEL TASTED IT.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.423
RICO TASTED IT.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.423
LOUELLA TASTED IT.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.217
WE ALL TASTED IT

08:26.465 --> 08:29.217
AND IT TASTES FINE!

08:30.135 --> 08:31.345
OKAY, DO YOU MIND?

08:31.386 --> 08:32.512
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

08:32.553 --> 08:34.055
I BELIEVE YOU COMPLETELY,

08:34.097 --> 08:37.142
BUT IT'S EASIER FOR ME

08:34.097 --> 08:37.142
TO TAKE ON THOSE WHO DOUBT YOU

08:37.184 --> 08:38.977
IF I'VE ACTUALLY

08:37.184 --> 08:38.977
TASTED IT MYSELF.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.603
FINE, GO AHEAD.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.316
OKAY, NOW I GET

08:42.314 --> 08:44.316
THE "SEWER-Y" REFERENCE.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.566

08:44.358 --> 08:45.566
ABOUT?

08:45.608 --> 08:46.860
COME HERE.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.528
JUST SEND THEM OUT

08:46.901 --> 08:48.528
SOME FREE DESSERTS.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.448
FREE DESSERTS? YOU'RE GIVING

08:48.569 --> 08:51.448

08:51.490 --> 08:52.740
SOOKIE, I LOVE YOU.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.034

08:54.075 --> 08:56.370
I LOVE YOUR FOOD,

08:54.075 --> 08:56.370
YOU KNOW THAT.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.370
YEAH.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.664
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

08:56.411 --> 08:59.664
THAT BITE I JUST HAD

08:59.706 --> 09:01.875
IS ONE OF THE WORST

08:59.706 --> 09:01.875
THINGS I'VE EVER TASTED,

09:01.916 --> 09:03.710
AND I'VE TASTED SOME

09:01.916 --> 09:03.710
VERY BAD THINGS.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.962
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T JUST

09:03.751 --> 09:05.962
ACCIDENTALLY DROP SOMETHING

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
IN THE FOOD, LIKE

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
STRYCHNINE OR MANURE?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.425
NO! I TESTED EACH DISH EVERY

09:08.048 --> 09:10.425
STEP OF THE WAY --

09:10.467 --> 09:13.470
THE BASE, THE STOCK,

09:10.467 --> 09:13.470
THE SAUCE, THE SEASONINGS.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.389
ARE YOU SICK?

09:13.512 --> 09:15.389
THE FLU OR A COLD?

09:15.430 --> 09:17.391
ALLERGIES CAN THROW

09:15.430 --> 09:17.391
YOUR TASTE BUDS OFF.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.725
NO, I'M NOT SICK.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.894
A LITTLE LAST WEEK,

09:18.766 --> 09:20.894
BUT NOTHING TODAY.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.729
YOU SHOULD THINK

09:20.935 --> 09:22.729
ABOUT GETTING A CHECKUP.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.647
MAYBE IT WAS MORE

09:22.770 --> 09:24.647
THAN LITTLE.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.940
THE FOOD WAS REALLY BAD?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.650
OH, HONEY, IT WAS JUST --

09:27.692 --> 09:29.819
WELL, YEAH, IT WAS

09:27.692 --> 09:29.819
REALLY THAT BAD.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.946
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.946
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.990
JUST HAVE MANUEL HELP YOU

09:31.988 --> 09:33.990
WITH THE TASTING

09:34.032 --> 09:35.409
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.660
PARIS IS GOING TO DRIVE ME

09:35.450 --> 09:37.660
COMPLETELY INSANE.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.870
OOH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.038
NO!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.915
GEEZ!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.915
BE HAPPY YOU'RE LOVED, HON.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.584
I GOT A KIT KAT IN MY PURSE.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.836
WHAT'S UP?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.836
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.255
SOOKIE MUST BE SICK

09:46.878 --> 09:48.255
OR SOMETHING.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.715
SOOKIE NEVER GETS SICK.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.715
I KNOW. SHE'LL BE FINE.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.385
SO, WHAT DID PARIS DO NOW?

09:50.757 --> 09:53.385
IT'S JUST PARIS.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.720
THERE'S THIS SPEECH CONTEST

09:53.427 --> 09:55.720
FOR THE BICENTENNIAL,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.764
AND I WASN'T EVEN GOING

09:55.762 --> 09:57.764
TO ENTER IT,

09:57.805 --> 09:59.807
BUT WITH THE WHOLE

09:57.805 --> 09:59.807
"IT'S MY LAST CHANCE

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
TO CRUSH YOU

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
BEFORE GRADUATION" COMMENT,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.437
I WANT TO ENTER, AND WIN,

10:03.478 --> 10:06.273
AND DANCE AROUND HER

10:03.478 --> 10:06.273
SAYING, "I WIN, I WIN, I WIN!"

10:06.314 --> 10:08.275
YOU'RE GETTING MORE

10:06.314 --> 10:08.275
AND MORE LIKE ME EVERYDAY.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.527
I KNOW IT'S PETTY.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.527
I SHOULD JUST IGNORE HER.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.572
THAT'S WHAT YOU<i> SHOULD</i> DO.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.572
THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.989
HOW COME YOU

10:13.613 --> 10:14.989
WEREN'T GONNA ENTER?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.824
I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.824
YOU LOVE SCHOOL THINGS.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.326
I DON'T LOVE

10:16.866 --> 10:18.326
DOING SCHOOL THINGS

10:18.368 --> 10:20.870
WHEN IT INVOLVES THE ENTIRE

10:18.368 --> 10:20.870
SCHOOL STARING AT ME.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.914
YOU HAD TO GIVE YOUR

10:20.912 --> 10:22.914
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL

10:20.912 --> 10:22.914
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

10:22.956 --> 10:24.541
IN FRONT OF

10:22.956 --> 10:24.541
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.959
BUT I<i> HAD</i> TO DO THAT.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.211
OH, SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA

10:26.000 --> 10:28.211
GO THROUGH LIFE

10:28.253 --> 10:30.464
ONLY DOING WHAT YOU

10:28.253 --> 10:30.464
<i>HAVE</i> TO DO?

10:30.505 --> 10:31.965
WELL...NO.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
BECAUSE A PERSON

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
WHO WANTS TO BE

10:33.841 --> 10:35.760
A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT

10:33.841 --> 10:35.760
FOR A LIVING

10:35.802 --> 10:37.304

THE OPPORTUNITY

10:37.345 --> 10:39.973
TO PRACTICE HER SPEECHING SKILLS

10:37.345 --> 10:39.973

10:52.277 --> 10:54.779
MM-HMM.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.575
OH, MY GOD!

10:56.990 --> 10:58.575

AAHHH!

11:03.997 --> 11:05.624

HAVE YOU TRIED

22:00.111 --> 22:01.487

22:01.528 --> 22:04.323
NO. HE WON'T LET ME

22:06.200 --> 22:07.576

22:07.618 --> 22:09.912
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO BUDGETS

22:07.618 --> 22:09.912
AND MINIVANS.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.914
OH, WELL,

22:09.954 --> 22:11.914

22:11.956 --> 22:14.750
IN ITS OWN OBNOXIOUS WAY.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.969
LITTLE. NOT AS MUCH

22:22.591 --> 22:24.969
AS I WOULD'VE THOUGHT.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.512
HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.512
YEAH.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.181

22:28.222 --> 22:30.224
WELL, WAS HE NICE TO YOU?

22:28.222 --> 22:30.224
VERY.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.392
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US

22:30.266 --> 22:32.392
WAS SO LONG AGO.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.021
DO YOU THINK WHAT I DID

22:32.434 --> 22:35.021
TO HIM WAS HORRIBLE?

22:35.062 --> 22:37.064
YOU MEAN DUMPING HIM

22:35.062 --> 22:37.064

22:39.066 --> 22:40.567
SO, MAX MEDINA'S BACK.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.403
NOT FOR LONG, THOUGH.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.403
I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T HATE ME.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.739
HE WAS PROBABLY

22:43.445 --> 22:45.739

22:45.781 --> 22:47.200
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIM.

22:47.241 --> 22:50.536
I'LL WRITE HIM A NOTE

22:47.241 --> 22:50.536

THE THOUGHT KEPT ROLLING

24:05.319 --> 24:07.280
AROUND IN MY HEAD.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.869
THE FIRE WAS NICE,

WITHOUT BEING SCOTTISH

40:18.541 --> 40:20.877
OR RIDING A FLOAT

40:18.541 --> 40:20.877
IN THE GAY-PRIDE PARADE.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.295
THAT'LL CHANGE SOMEDAY,

40:20.919 --> 40:22.295
MY FRIEND,

40:22.337 --> 40:24.923
AND WHEN IT DOES,

40:22.337 --> 40:24.923
I STILL WON'T WEAR A SKIRT,

40:24.964 --> 40:26.591
BUT I'LL APPLAUD

40:24.964 --> 40:26.591
THOSE THAT DO,

40:26.632 --> 40:29.677
AND THEN CROSS THE STREET

40:26.632 --> 40:29.677
SO NOBODY SEES I'M WITH THEM.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.305
IT WAS NICE SEEING YOU.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.305
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.141
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.141
I WILL.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.653
AND APPARENTLY I'M...

40:47.695 --> 40:49.530
NOT OVER IT.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.294
I'M NOT GETTING RID OF MY

41:00.333 --> 41:02.294
KNIVES, JACKSON.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.462
I'M A CHEF.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.462
I HAVE TO HAVE KNIVES.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.923
SOOKIE.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.923
AND I'M ALSO NOT CUTTING OFF

41:04.503 --> 41:06.923
THE WATER SUPPLY,

41:06.965 --> 41:10.343
AND I'M NOT SANDING DOWN ALL

41:06.965 --> 41:10.343
THE EDGES OF MY FURNITURE.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.971
NOW, I'M SORRY THAT YOU THINK

41:10.385 --> 41:12.971
THIS HOUSE IS A DEATHTRAP.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.640
I'M SORRY THAT YOU THINK THERE'S

41:13.012 --> 41:15.640
NOTHING IN OUR LIFESTYLES

41:15.681 --> 41:17.475
THAT IS CONDUCIVE

41:15.681 --> 41:17.475
TO HAVING A BABY,

41:17.516 --> 41:20.103
BUT OUR KID IS GONNA HAVE TO BE

41:17.516 --> 41:20.103
BRIGHT ENOUGH

41:20.145 --> 41:21.520
NOT TO DISCONNECT

41:20.145 --> 41:21.520
THE WATER HOSE

41:21.562 --> 41:23.356
THAT GOES TO THE AUTOMATIC

41:21.562 --> 41:23.356
ICE MAKER

41:23.398 --> 41:25.984
AND SHOVE IT UP

41:23.398 --> 41:25.984
HIS OR HER NOSE.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.486
NOW GO TO SLEEP.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.704
DID I TELL YOU

41:35.868 --> 41:38.704
HOW HAPPY I AM?

41:39.664 --> 41:42.208
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.589
I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER

41:48.631 --> 41:51.009
ABOUT ANYTHING

41:48.631 --> 41:51.009
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.135
REALLY?

41:52.177 --> 41:53.511
OUR WEDDING DAY,

41:53.552 --> 41:56.014
BUT THIS IS RUNNING

41:53.552 --> 41:56.014
A REALLY CLOSE SECOND.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.183
JACKSON.

42:01.727 --> 42:04.230
NOW, IF YOU WOULD JUST GET RID

42:01.727 --> 42:04.230
OF THE KNIVES,

42:04.272 --> 42:07.233
I THINK IT COULD MAKE IT

42:04.272 --> 42:07.233
A TIE.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.861
I WASN'T KIDDING

42:07.275 --> 42:09.861
ABOUT THE KNIVES.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.404

42:13.072 --> 42:14.866

43:00.453 --> 43:04.623

43:15.968 --> 43:18.888

43:18.930 --> 43:20.348
