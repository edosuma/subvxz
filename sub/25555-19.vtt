the wrong way.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.638

12:52.705 --> 12:54.840
{\an1}we were about to go
into Shore Dogs.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.109
{\an1}I'm driving, she puts
her feet up on the dash.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.644
I was like, "Can you
put your feet down?"

12:58.711 --> 13:00.880
'Cause last I checked
it's not an Ottoman,

13:00.946 --> 13:02.114
it's a center console.

{\an1}So, anyway, instead
of putting her feet down,

13:04.383 --> 13:07.219
{\an1}she kicked her feet up
even more.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.854

put your feet down."

13:08.921 --> 13:11.690
The way she said it to us

13:11.757 --> 13:13.759
it was that you called her
a (bleep) bitch.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.628
{\an1}I honestly don't feel
like that's what I said,

13:15.694 --> 13:17.863
{\an1}but if I did,
I'll let her let me have it.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.131
{\an4}So be it.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.131

{\an1}But that's not how
I intended it to come across.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.237
{\an4}It was to the point where she
said she didn't want to even
sit by you on the plane.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.805
{\an5}Well, I could tell.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.805
And we can't...

13:26.872 --> 13:29.508

because she looks up to you,

does have a thing for you.
