Thomas? You ready?

01:31.003 --> 01:32.614
Hey, Higgy.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.877
Everything okay?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.400
Fine.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.185
Your fridge is empty again.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.969
Oh, yeah, I just started...

01:40.012 --> 01:41.275
eating out more.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.406
It also smells different
in here.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.668
Is that a new scented candle?

01:43.712 --> 01:44.974
No.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.062
No, that was a Lia thing.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.194
Um...

01:47.237 --> 01:49.544
I guess that's just,
uh, ocean mist.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.503
Well, whilst I, of course,
respect your decision

01:52.547 --> 01:54.114
in regards to Lia,

01:54.157 --> 01:55.985
I must say, I am gonna miss
some of the good habits

01:56.028 --> 01:57.943
you acquired during her tenure.

01:57.987 --> 02:00.555
Well, if I can give it up
so quickly,

02:00.598 --> 02:02.034
was it every really a habit?

02:02.078 --> 02:04.472
And whilst we ponder
that zen koan,

02:04.515 --> 02:05.995
do you want to change out of
those board shorts?

02:06.038 --> 02:08.519
Kumu's taking our new client
to the study as we speak.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.825
Got it.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.482
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.527
- Hello.
- Thomas, this is...

02:16.571 --> 02:18.529
Hi, Judge Rachel Park.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.878
We've met.

02:19.922 --> 02:20.966
Last summer, in her courtroom,

02:21.010 --> 02:22.751
when she held me in contempt.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.798
- You were in Kenya.
- Oh.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.757
Mr. Magnum was
testifying on trial,

02:28.800 --> 02:31.238
and I asked him to disclose some
sensitive information

02:31.281 --> 02:34.284
about his client,
and he patently refused.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.418
And she threw me in jail
for a couple days.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.421
Uh, sorry, is this gonna be
an issue for us?

02:40.464 --> 02:41.552
No. No, no.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.032
She was doing her job.
I was doing mine.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.642
But I am a little curious
as to why

02:44.686 --> 02:46.427
you would want to hire me
after that.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.690
Actually, that's exactly
why I want to hire you.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.561
You proved how
far you'd go

02:50.605 --> 02:52.215
to protect your
clients' secrets,

02:52.259 --> 02:55.175
and I need someone I can trust
with mine.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.137
Okay, uh, tell us

03:01.181 --> 03:03.400
how we can help you.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.577
Last week, I was nominated
for a seat

03:06.621 --> 03:08.231
on Hawaii's Supreme Court.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.625
- Congratulations.
- That's quite an honor.

03:10.668 --> 03:11.713
Thank you.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.542
Unfortunately...

03:14.585 --> 03:16.587
someone's trying
to blackmail me.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.550
"I know the truth about you.
Keep quiet

03:22.593 --> 03:24.595
and I'll be in touch."

03:24.639 --> 03:26.031
Right, well, I mean,

03:26.075 --> 03:28.251
we can certainly look
into this number,

03:28.295 --> 03:29.426
but it is likely

03:29.470 --> 03:31.472
a burner phone.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.169
I'm sorry, we have to ask.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.779
What is this about?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.611
I grew up very poor.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.440
I had to scrape and fight
for everything

03:43.484 --> 03:44.746
I've achieved in my life.

03:44.789 --> 03:47.618
In my last semester
of law school,

03:47.662 --> 03:50.142
my scholarship
just fell through.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.928
I was devastated.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.322
But I wasn't gonna quit,
not when I was that close.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.107
When my student loans maxed out,

03:58.150 --> 04:00.283
I just couldn't make
that kind of money.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.156
I went to work as an escort.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.769
It was three months,
20 years ago,

04:07.812 --> 04:09.074
and I thought
I'd left it behind me.

04:09.118 --> 04:12.164
Until now.

04:13.122 --> 04:16.299
This appears to have been taken
from an old videotape.

04:16.343 --> 04:21.435
Do you know if any of your
encounters were ever recorded?

04:21.478 --> 04:23.828
No. I didn't think so.

04:23.872 --> 04:26.309
And I have... I have no idea
where this is coming from,

04:26.353 --> 04:28.485
and I can't go to HPD.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.618
I have a husband
and I have children,

04:30.661 --> 04:34.622
and I have spent two decades
building my career.

04:34.665 --> 04:38.278
I want you to find this video,
and I want you to destroy it.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.409
Can you do that?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.324
Well, we'll do what we can,

04:41.368 --> 04:43.283
but being that this is
a screengrab,

04:43.326 --> 04:45.850
it's most likely
been digitized.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.724
Nothing on the Internet
is ever truly deleted,

04:49.767 --> 04:52.944
so it might be impossible
to destroy every copy.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.339
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.733
What we can do is
track down the blackmailer,

04:58.776 --> 05:02.127
and maybe find some leverage
we can use against them

05:02.171 --> 05:04.086
to stop them from
releasing the video.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.131
They haven't asked me
for anything.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.308
They haven't made any demands.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.135
Well, oftentimes
what they first want is silence.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.572
They want to know
if you can keep quiet

05:11.615 --> 05:13.661
before they make a demand
that can lead back to them.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.663
Do you have any idea
who this might have been?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.665
No.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.754
Obviously I'm a judge,
and I've made enemies.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.539
This nomination has
put me front and center

05:22.583 --> 05:24.149
in the public eye.

05:24.193 --> 05:27.109
So our blackmailer could be
somebody who doesn't want you

05:27.152 --> 05:28.153
on the High Court,

05:28.197 --> 05:29.503
somebody you ruled against,

05:29.546 --> 05:31.592
or just somebody
who's after money.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.245
I think the best place
to start is with

05:33.289 --> 05:35.813
whoever made
the original videotape.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.815
Where would you meet
your clients?

05:37.859 --> 05:39.556
Hotels. Suites.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.558
There was a madam
who would book the services.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.126
Okay, so she could have hidden
cameras before you arrived.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.650
Do you happen to
remember her name?

05:46.694 --> 05:48.652
Halia Hickam.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.393
I'm pretty sure
that was an alias,

05:50.437 --> 05:52.352
and I have no idea
where to find her

05:52.395 --> 05:54.049
after all these years.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.225
You can leave that to us.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.493
Okay, their arms,
you pin down the arms,

06:03.537 --> 06:06.191
you wrap this around,
you gotta tuck it in tight.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.368
And then you do the feet.
I think it's the feet.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.194
Maybe it's...

06:09.238 --> 06:11.371
Rick, uh, you all right?

06:11.414 --> 06:14.112
Hey. Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm just...

06:14.156 --> 06:15.723
learning to swaddle a baby.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.682
I guess papayas are supposed to
be around the same size.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.816
True, but it isn't squirming,
crying or soiling itself.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.644
Well, listen,
baby steps, Higgins.

06:23.687 --> 06:26.211
All right, fatherhood is
a serious thing.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.691
I just want to
be ready for it.

06:27.735 --> 06:31.521
I also have a restaurant
efficiency expert coming by here

06:31.565 --> 06:33.915
to show me how a few
small changes can help me

06:33.958 --> 06:35.525
increase profits at this place.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.135
What kind of changes
are we talking about?

06:37.179 --> 06:38.876
I'm not really sure,
but you know,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.704
after two and a half years
of running this place

06:40.748 --> 06:42.445
and just breaking even,

06:42.489 --> 06:45.709
well, I gotta level up if
I'm gonna raise this kid right.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.625
Do you have any idea
how much it costs

06:48.669 --> 06:51.411
to raise a child from birth
to age 18?

06:51.454 --> 06:53.108
Uh...

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066
$233,000!

06:55.110 --> 06:58.156
Okay, but I mean, you know
it isn't all due

06:58.200 --> 06:59.636
on delivery, right?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.029
Well, no. You're right.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.074
And that's why
you have to be ready.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.511
So it's like baby swaddling.

07:04.554 --> 07:07.427
You learn, you get good,
you become an expert,

07:07.470 --> 07:09.516
and then you're ready
for when the time comes.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.388
Uh...

07:12.432 --> 07:16.044
Well, that is smart,
once you learn how to do it.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.785
But, you know, aside from
all the swaddling stuff,

07:17.828 --> 07:19.743
were you able to get
the information we requested?

07:19.787 --> 07:22.442
Yes, about that, you know,
it's not cool to ask a guy

07:22.485 --> 07:25.488
who's about to become a dad
to find an escort service.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.186
Now, what do you two want
with this madam, anyway?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.450
Well, that's not really... Let's not get into it.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.973
I mean, I know you're both
single now,

07:32.016 --> 07:33.931
but it seems like
- a weird way to meet people.
- Rick.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.542
I will literally murder you.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.934
Understood.

07:36.978 --> 07:37.848
Here's what I got.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.502
Her name is Halia Hickam.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.939
She was a high-end madam
who catered to

07:41.983 --> 07:43.506
an exclusive clientele.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.900
She had an escort service
that went dark a few years back,

07:45.943 --> 07:49.512
and my source says
her real name is Sheila Adams.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.384
Apparently she has
a very lovely house in Portlock.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.649
Okay, can you send me
- the address?
- I already did.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.346
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:57.389 --> 07:59.740
I have a papaya
to put down for a nap.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.310
Well, you'd have to
blackmail a lot of people

08:05.354 --> 08:07.269
to afford a house in Portlock.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.445
You up for a house call?

08:23.981 --> 08:25.983
Hey.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.123
Hi there.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.168
Sorry, we don't mean
to intrude.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.736
We did knock and
there was no answer,

08:39.780 --> 08:43.087
and then we spied him.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.350
That is a beautiful view,
by the way.

08:45.394 --> 08:49.050
Thanks. Now, can I
help you with something?

08:49.093 --> 08:51.835
Well, we certainly
hope so, Halia.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.361
I'm afraid you have me
confused with someone else.

08:56.405 --> 09:00.061
No. Actually, Sheila,
I don't think we do.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.806
Why don't you two
go wash up,

09:05.849 --> 09:08.373
and I'll make us
some lunch.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.683
You're trespassing
on private property.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.381
Hmm, private property
that was paid for

09:16.425 --> 09:18.601
in millions of illicit income,

09:18.645 --> 09:21.604
none of which you disclosed
to the IRS, by the way.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.867
We don't want them
or your grandkids to know

09:23.911 --> 09:25.913
where you got the money
to pay for all this.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.568
What do you want then?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.134
Well, for starters,
we want to know why

09:30.178 --> 09:31.875
you're blackmailing a judge.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.407
I was Halia Hickam.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.192
I've been retired
for years.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.542
While you were in business,
you secretly videotaped

09:46.586 --> 09:49.371
your clients with your escorts;
did you not?

09:49.414 --> 09:53.114
I made those tapes to negotiate
additional payments

09:53.157 --> 09:54.942
from my clients,
but I would never do that

09:54.985 --> 09:56.552
to one of my girls.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.076
And I'm not the one
who's blackmailing the judge.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.513
But you know who is.

10:03.646 --> 10:07.345
About two weeks ago,
a woman came to see me.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.393
<i>Just like you, she knew</i> <i>
all about my former business.</i>

10:11.436 --> 10:13.743
<i>And just like you,</i> <i>
she threatened to</i>

10:13.787 --> 10:18.443
<i>destroy my life unless
I turned over one of my tapes.</i>

10:18.487 --> 10:22.317
A 20-year-old video of
Rachel Park with a client.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.624
- Did you get her name?
- No.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.582
But she was 30s,

10:26.626 --> 10:29.280
intimidating, with a snake
tattoo on her neck.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.805
That's all I can tell you.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.415
Now, are we done?

10:33.458 --> 10:35.852
Yes.

10:35.896 --> 10:40.161
Tell Rachel I'm sorry.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.170
So she said neck tattoo
came to see her

10:49.213 --> 10:51.389
- about two weeks ago, right?
- Yeah. And?

10:51.433 --> 10:54.131
Well, she just got nominated
to the Hawaii Supreme Court

10:54.175 --> 10:55.393
last week.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.875
So the blackmail
isn't about that.

11:01.922 --> 11:05.273
Hey, Judge Park.
Good timing.

11:05.316 --> 11:08.058
Um, we're beginning to think
that this blackmail

11:08.102 --> 11:10.278
has nothing to do
with the nomination.

11:10.321 --> 11:13.150
I know it doesn't.
I just got another text.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.499
What does it say?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.676
They want me to throw
a murder trial.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.298
"Throw out the emails
in the Reed trial

11:30.341 --> 11:32.866
or the full video goes online.
Choice is yours."

11:32.909 --> 11:34.650
I took an oath
to uphold the law.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.739
I am not letting
some killer run free.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.480
This gives you guys 24 hours
to find them,

11:38.523 --> 11:40.221
or this destroys my life.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.485
It's another burner phone.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.443
It was used and then immediately
turned off like last time.

11:45.487 --> 11:48.272
It's a dead end, I'm afraid.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.796
Actually, I don't think so.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.059
The blackmailer gave us
a major clue

11:52.102 --> 11:53.625
as to who they are.

11:53.669 --> 11:56.237
They have a vested interest in
this trial, so we need to know

11:56.280 --> 11:58.326
everything you do.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.762
Trial started this morning.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.069
<i>Owen Reed stands</i> <i>
accused of murdering</i>

12:02.112 --> 12:04.898
<i>his business partner</i> <i>
Kendall Parsons.</i>

12:04.941 --> 12:07.552
<i>The murder came as a shock</i> <i>
to everyone who knew them.</i>

12:07.596 --> 12:09.119
<i>Reed had been friends</i> <i>
with Parsons</i>

12:09.163 --> 12:10.991
<i>and his wife Anna since college.</i>

12:11.034 --> 12:12.688
<i>Five years ago,</i> <i>
the two men started</i>

12:12.732 --> 12:14.603
<i>a small hedge fund together.</i>

12:15.299 --> 12:16.474
Sharks Cove Capital.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.562
Parsons managed the clients,

12:17.606 --> 12:19.651
but Reed was the golden goose.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.350
He's a quant analyst
delivering killer returns.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.221
So what happened
the night of the murder?

12:24.265 --> 12:27.790
Reed claims they were working
late at the office.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.923
He goes out to dinner,
he comes back to the office.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.751
<i>He found Parsons bleeding out,</i>

12:31.794 --> 12:35.015
<i>struck in the head</i> <i>
with a statue from his desk.</i>

12:35.058 --> 12:36.799
<i>Reed claims he immediately</i> <i>
called 911</i>

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
<i>and tried to save Parsons' life.</i>

12:38.845 --> 12:41.282
<i>But when police arrived,
they found him covered in blood</i>

12:41.325 --> 12:43.632
<i>with the murder weapon</i> <i>
right next to him.</i>

12:43.675 --> 12:45.068
There's no sign
of forced entry.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.548
Reed's the only one
with the other key,

12:46.591 --> 12:48.811
and when the detectives
discovered that the two of them

12:48.855 --> 12:50.291
are exchanging angry emails

12:50.334 --> 12:52.554
about Reed's
compensation package,

12:52.597 --> 12:53.773
it's all over.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.252
So those are the emails
that the blackmailer

12:55.296 --> 12:56.384
wants you to throw out?

12:56.427 --> 12:57.559
Yes. And his attorney

12:57.602 --> 12:59.169
tried to toss it out
on a technicality.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.562
I ruled it in.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.738
But soon as it's presented
in court as evidence,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.261
he will absolutely try
to object again

13:04.305 --> 13:06.481
so that he can lay
the groundwork for an appeal.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.787
And whoever sent the text

13:07.830 --> 13:09.353
wants you to sustain
the objection

13:09.397 --> 13:10.833
and exclude the emails.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.227
And without evidence
of motive, it's gonna be

13:13.270 --> 13:15.446
extremely hard to get
a conviction from the jury.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.665
Exactly.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.232
Prosecution is going
to enter them

13:18.275 --> 13:19.842
into evidence tomorrow.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.757
I can buy you guys
as much time as I can,

13:21.801 --> 13:22.976
but 3:00 p.m. is my limit.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.978
Well, at least we now
have two suspects.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.501
I mean,
both Reed and his attorney

13:26.544 --> 13:28.068
stand to benefit
from the blackmail.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.678
And the woman who acquired the video

13:29.721 --> 13:30.897
from Halia Hickam.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.812
She's probably a fixer
for the defense.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.336
You did get the description
I sent you, right?

13:35.379 --> 13:37.773
The neck tattoo?
It sounds familiar.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.254
I think I've seen her
at the courthouse.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.778
Look, guys, I gotta get back.
Trial's about to resume.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.390
All right, well, just stay calm,
do your job. We'll do ours.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.876
So if neck tattoo
was in the courthouse,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.922
she had to have
passed through security.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.100
Taken by courthouse
security yesterday

14:00.143 --> 14:01.884
for a visitor ID badge.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.538
That's got to be her.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.713
Name and address
are both fake.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.367
No photo in the
Hawaii DMV database,

14:06.410 --> 14:08.369
but I can tell you
she goes by Maya.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.024
- You know her?
- Not exactly.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.548
A few months back, I was
testifying on a double murder.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.377
Case was a slam dunk,
then she starts showing up.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.814
Next thing I know,
evidence goes missing,

14:18.858 --> 14:20.207
witnesses change
their stories.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.556
The whole thing
goes up in smoke.

14:21.599 --> 14:22.905
Seems you were right
about her being a fixer.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.864
Do you know how
to find her?

14:24.907 --> 14:27.954
After the trial,
I tried to track her down.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.391
Word is she used to be
a lawyer on the mainland

14:30.434 --> 14:31.566
till she got disbarred.

14:31.609 --> 14:32.959
But that's as far
as I got.

14:33.002 --> 14:36.223
People like Maya,
they don't have business cards.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.572
What's this all about, anyway?

14:37.615 --> 14:39.704
You know I'm gonna
find out eventually.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.448
To be honest, Gordie,
I really hope you don't.

14:44.492 --> 14:47.190
Sorry.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.671
- Thanks.
- Yep.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.896
♪ No matter where I go...

14:56.939 --> 14:59.333
Wow, last week I had
never even heard

14:59.376 --> 15:01.074
of a restaurant
efficiency expert.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.903
Now, mind blown.
Thanks so much for coming in.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.905
Great meeting you.
Give me a buzz

15:05.948 --> 15:07.819
if you have any questions
about the plan.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.604
I'm ready to start
whenever you are.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.433
We'll be in touch.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.567
Yeah, we ain't doing
any of that.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.482
I'm not so sure
about that, TC.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.962
There are some
good ideas in here.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.921
Are you kidding me?
This guy's talking about

15:21.964 --> 15:24.532
knocking out walls,
losing the pool table,

15:24.575 --> 15:27.274
raising prices,
shrinking portions.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.624
And what the hell is
a 45-minute chair?

15:29.667 --> 15:30.973
That's one of the best
things about it, okay.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.715
So right now we have
two-hour chairs, okay.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.847
We swap those out
for 45-minute chairs,

15:35.891 --> 15:37.806
we'll more than double
our turnover.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.200
By making customers
more uncomfortable?

15:40.243 --> 15:43.464
Do you even hear
- yourself right now?
- They're just suggestions.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.987
We don't have to do
everything in here.

15:45.031 --> 15:48.643
Okay, which one of these
bad ideas do you want to do?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.559
Listen, this is your
side hustle,

15:51.602 --> 15:53.604
but I got all my eggs
in this basket.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.563
And now I got another egg
in another basket.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.912
You know what I mean?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.001
I knew that's what
this was all about.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.570
Hey, it's not just me. I mean,
you got Cade to support now.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.746
You know, we both need to think
about making real money.

16:04.789 --> 16:08.010
So a customer doesn't get
to park it at their table

16:08.054 --> 16:11.013
for quite as long;
I guess I'm okay with that.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.972
Yeah.

16:14.495 --> 16:18.499
I have called Rick, Jin
and every lawyer

16:18.542 --> 16:20.631
and street person I know,
and still so far

16:20.675 --> 16:23.025
no one's been able to get us
any closer to finding Maya.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.766
Yeah, I've also hit a wall,
I'm afraid.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.682
I did a deep and thorough dive
on our fixer,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.249
and I can't find anything
about Maya online.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.512
Her operation is
completely off the books.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.992
What about Reed
and the attorney?

16:33.035 --> 16:34.341
If they're behind this,
maybe we can use them

16:34.384 --> 16:35.951
to get to Maya.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.779
No, no luck there either,
I'm afraid.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.563
Reed was considered
a flight risk,

16:39.607 --> 16:42.044
so Judge Park had him held
pending trial.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.393
All his calls are monitored,

16:43.437 --> 16:45.352
and the visitor logs
don't show anyone matching

16:45.395 --> 16:47.049
- Maya's description.
- And the attorney?

16:47.093 --> 16:48.224
Blake Garcia, Esquire.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.791
I got into his emails.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.576
He's pretty old school,
to say the least.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.885
"Call me." "Call me."

16:56.928 --> 16:58.887
I guess that's his
response to everything.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.498
In thread after thread.
Just "Call me."

17:01.542 --> 17:04.066
I mean, he never puts anything
down in an email,

17:04.110 --> 17:06.068
so he's certainly not going to
be firing off messages

17:06.112 --> 17:08.636
talking about
blackmailing a judge.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.813
Maybe he didn't leave
a digital trail.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.120
But if he's as old school
as you say,

17:14.163 --> 17:16.122
maybe he left a paper one.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.689
You're not seriously
suggesting

17:18.733 --> 17:20.387
that we break into
an attorney's office

17:20.430 --> 17:22.128
in the middle
of a murder trial?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.391
All I'm saying is that he's
the only person we know

17:24.434 --> 17:26.262
who could have
a direct line to Maya.

17:26.306 --> 17:30.440
And we are running out of time.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.540
You know, now that
we're actually doing this,

17:43.584 --> 17:45.542
I'm even more convinced
it's a bad idea.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.805
Which is why we need
to find what

17:47.849 --> 17:49.068
we're looking for
and get out of here

17:49.111 --> 17:50.852
as quickly as possible.

17:50.895 --> 17:54.725
Anything that ties Garcia
- to the blackmail or Maya.
- Yep.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.264
Higgins.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.569
Yeah?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.444
"Negligent homicide,
two to four.

18:17.487 --> 18:18.662
"Manslaughter, five to seven.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.229
"Second-degree murder,
ten to 12.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.796
But the P.A. wants
murder one."

18:21.839 --> 18:23.841
Garcia's trying to make
a plea deal for Owen Reed.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.495
Why try to make a deal
if you're already

18:25.539 --> 18:27.193
blackmailing the
judge, though?

18:29.456 --> 18:30.718
We must have tripped an alarm.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.286
We did not trip an alarm.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.462
Go out back.
I'll draw 'em off.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.768
Okay.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.643
Don't let him get away!

18:53.175 --> 18:55.525
HPD! Stop where you are!

18:56.309 --> 18:58.006
All right.
Hold it!

19:05.883 --> 19:08.234
All right,
get 'em in.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.018
How'd you get onto us, anyway?

19:10.061 --> 19:11.541
Anonymous tip.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.399
Hmm.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.057
Ah...

19:49.100 --> 19:51.059
So...

19:51.102 --> 19:53.540
what are you in for?

19:53.583 --> 19:55.759
You may find this
amusing, Magnum,

19:55.803 --> 19:58.066
but it isn't exactly
my idea of a good time.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.155
Hey, that photo booth
was pretty fun.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.896
Oh, yeah.
Maybe they'll let me

20:01.939 --> 20:03.898
use the mug shot
on my new passport.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.944
I'm sure all of this is
gonna do just wonders

20:06.988 --> 20:08.424
for my citizenship application.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.470
Hey, I'm as frustrated
as you are, all right.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.907
The judge is counting on us,
and we're sitting in here

20:12.950 --> 20:14.387
while the clock ticks down.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.258
That poor woman.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.913
I've had my close calls
with secrets coming out,

20:18.956 --> 20:23.526
but to have something
so personal...

20:23.570 --> 20:25.441
I just can't imagine it.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.271
Which is why we have to stop
that video from coming out.

20:29.315 --> 20:34.145
All right, so I guess Maya
was watching the judge,

20:34.189 --> 20:35.973
who she then tailed
to Robin's Nest,

20:36.017 --> 20:39.238
and then followed us to
the defense attorney's office.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.849
And then calls in the B&E
to take us off the board.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.155
Must mean we're getting
close to something, right?

20:44.199 --> 20:45.635
Well, I don't know.
I mean, just because

20:45.679 --> 20:47.202
she followed us
to Garcia's office

20:47.246 --> 20:49.726
doesn't mean that she's
necessarily working for him.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.555
We haven't found anything to
suggest that they're in touch.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.948
Yeah. And then there's
the question

20:53.991 --> 20:55.732
why Reed's attorney is
still trying to cut a deal

20:55.776 --> 20:58.213
if they're blackmailing
the judge.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.955
Maybe it's insurance, in case
the judge doesn't comply.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.653
Or maybe they're not
behind the blackmail.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.699
Reed was the hedge fund's
golden goose.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.614
Maybe one of the investors
was willing to

21:07.657 --> 21:09.790
help a murderer go free
if it meant it kept

21:09.833 --> 21:11.444
bringing in those
killer returns.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.142
Yeah, we gotta get
the investors list.

21:14.185 --> 21:17.406
Yeah. Well, why don't I
just google that for you

21:17.450 --> 21:19.495
from the stainless steel
toilet?

21:19.539 --> 21:21.845
Are you--
You sitting on the toilet?

21:21.889 --> 21:24.239
You know what, Higgy,
don't talk to me while you're

21:24.283 --> 21:25.719
on the toilet,
all right?

21:25.762 --> 21:28.287
I'm gonna work on
getting us bailed out.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.333
Hey, guard, how 'bout
that phone call?

21:36.860 --> 21:38.906
Hey, Juliet,

21:38.949 --> 21:41.038
have the lads been fed
this morning?

21:41.082 --> 21:43.040
Zeus brought me his bowl, and...

21:45.478 --> 21:47.044
You're not here.

21:52.963 --> 21:57.141
This is a collect call
from Honolulu County Jail.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.795
You have a call from...

21:58.839 --> 22:00.319
Thomas Magnum.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.365
Press one
to accept the charges.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.499
Thomas?

22:12.156 --> 22:14.594
I expect this sort of thing
from you, Thomas,

22:14.637 --> 22:16.160
but really, Juliet?

22:16.204 --> 22:18.249
You were right. Rick would
have been less judgy.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.208
- Mm-hmm.
- What I want to know is

22:20.251 --> 22:22.341
why didn't you ask Gordon
to bail you out?

22:22.384 --> 22:25.648
Well, uh, Gordon's
the judgiest of all.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.389
Plus, he's very curious
about this case,

22:27.433 --> 22:28.912
and it's not something
we can talk about.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.436
Well, then, I won't ask.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.307
Here's the tablet
you asked for,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.788
and I got your Ferrari
out of impound.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.442
It's parked out front.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.400
Oh, thank you! I mean,

22:38.444 --> 22:40.707
you really come through
all the time. Although,

22:40.750 --> 22:43.318
you know, the one thing I forgot
to ask you for was breakfast.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.625
What am I, a rookie?

22:47.061 --> 22:49.759
Last time I was in the clink,
I was starving.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.849
Kumu, you are a lifesaver.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.198
Definitely.

22:54.242 --> 22:59.029
Oh... TC says he needs me
at La Mariana ASAP.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.423
I'm just putting out fires
all over the place.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.644
Oh, try not to get
locked up again

23:04.687 --> 23:06.428
before TC's done with me.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.473
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.822
Mm-hmm.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.041
Looks like I missed
a bunch of calls

23:11.085 --> 23:12.739
- from our client.
- Oh.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.352
Hey, it's Thomas Magnum.
Everything okay?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.789
Apparently not.
I was just in court

23:19.833 --> 23:21.443
with Owen Reed's attorney
who's claiming

23:21.487 --> 23:23.576
prosecutorial misconduct
because two

23:23.619 --> 23:25.142
private investigators

23:25.186 --> 23:28.450
with close ties to HPD broke
into his office last night.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.408
Yeah, yeah.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.800
- I can explain.
- Please don't.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.193
The less I know the better.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.282
I denied his motion
for a mistrial,

23:34.325 --> 23:36.240
- but this can't happen again.
- No, it won't.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.373
Look, we're just trying to
find out who the blackmailer is,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.201
and we are running out of time.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.682
Sooner than we thought.
The P.A. just rearranged

23:42.725 --> 23:45.902
her witness list, moving
the email evidence up an hour.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.252
I understand.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.431
We have until 2:00 to stop
that video from coming out.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.437
Okay, I'm already into
the hedge fund's computers.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.177
They had several hundred
investors,

24:00.221 --> 24:02.092
including some
immediate suspects,

24:02.136 --> 24:03.877
like Yakuza boss Osi Shima.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.879
It's gonna take hours to
sift through all this data

24:05.922 --> 24:08.664
to find some connection
- to Maya.
- It's time we don't have.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.798
What we need to do is
find Maya herself, immediately.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.887
Done.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.063
What?

24:20.197 --> 24:22.809
Thomas, Juliet...

24:22.852 --> 24:24.463
Let's talk.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.085
Thank you.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.522
Sure you don't want something?
It's on me.

24:40.566 --> 24:44.004
That's very generous
of Mr. Shima, but I'll pass.

24:44.047 --> 24:47.529
Nice try, but you're not gonna
get a name that easy.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.228
I protect my clients,
same as you.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.362
Then why are we here?

24:54.405 --> 24:56.843
So I can give you some
professional advice.

24:58.235 --> 25:01.500
You two are out of your league.
I'm very good at what I do.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.720
We did track you down
in less than 24 hours.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.418
Really, how good are you?

25:07.462 --> 25:11.031
Did you?
What's my last name?

25:12.162 --> 25:15.078
It's really not gonna be
that hard to find out.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.472
Disbarred lawyers
are pretty rare.

25:18.299 --> 25:20.910
True, but state bar associations
are easy to hack,

25:20.954 --> 25:23.217
and records are
easy to change.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.784
Mm.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.525
Since you're in a talkative
mood, why don't you tell us

25:26.568 --> 25:28.178
how you lost
your license.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.529
What, did you try to pull some
shady tricks as an attorney,

25:30.572 --> 25:32.095
got caught?

25:33.314 --> 25:36.186
The only tricks you should be
concerned with right now

25:36.230 --> 25:38.014
are the ones
your client was turning.

25:38.058 --> 25:40.887
Look, she either does

25:40.930 --> 25:42.715
what we want,
or the truth comes out.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.717
So let's be real.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.370
I can promise you

25:46.414 --> 25:48.590
this case is gonna cost you more
than you're gonna make.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.550
But if you walk away now...

25:52.376 --> 25:54.291
That more than covers
your usual fee.

25:54.335 --> 25:58.034
Plus a little extra for bail.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.262
You're gonna have to do better
than that.

26:15.008 --> 26:17.793
$10,000. Final offer.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.884
Sorry. Not gonna do it.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.887
Hmm. Interesting.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.848
You really think
this is gonna end well?

26:28.891 --> 26:30.763
Threatening a judge,

26:30.806 --> 26:32.808
trying to get a killer off?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.854
You don't know he's a killer.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.334
Innocent until proven guilty,
right?

26:37.378 --> 26:39.423
And don't even think
about tailing me.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.948
I catch you
around my business again,

26:41.991 --> 26:44.428
that video hits the web.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.913
She was lovely.

26:50.957 --> 26:54.221
You weren't seriously
considering taking her bribe?

26:54.264 --> 26:55.657
No, I'm trying to
get her to tell us

26:55.701 --> 26:57.093
how much money
she's making.

26:57.137 --> 27:00.270
You think she was offering us
a portion of her fee.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.533
With an ego that big, you think
she's gonna go to her client

27:02.577 --> 27:04.013
and say, "You know, hey,
can I have some money

27:04.057 --> 27:05.580
for these people that
are screwing up my plan?"

27:05.624 --> 27:07.016
If I was cutting
somebody in on my fee,

27:07.060 --> 27:08.801
I wouldn't do more than 20%,
and I'm a nice guy.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.151
All right? She-She's not
going higher than ten.

27:11.194 --> 27:14.371
So Maya's making
at least $100,000.

27:14.415 --> 27:17.679
Yeah. That kind of payout,

27:17.723 --> 27:20.247
whoever she's working
with has deep pockets.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.945
So maybe we're right about
it being one of the investors.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.294
And we now have

27:24.338 --> 27:27.167
less than three hours
to figure out which one.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.569
All right, I'm into
Hans Nakamura's phone records.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.180
I'm sending you the link now.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.442
I'll start hacking

27:41.485 --> 27:42.878
the next investor.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.358
Got it.

27:44.401 --> 27:45.359
I'm seeing
if there's any connection

27:45.402 --> 27:47.187
between Hans and Maya.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.975
Hey, Judge.
You're on speaker.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.063
You got me and Higgins.

27:54.107 --> 27:56.196
Please tell me you have news.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.502
Well, we do, but I
wish it was better.

27:58.546 --> 28:00.330
We've narrowed the list
of suspects down

28:00.374 --> 28:02.855
to 14 investors with a history
of shady business dealings,

28:02.898 --> 28:05.771
but so far,
no connection with Maya.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.860
Okay.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.426
I'm due back in court
in 20 minutes

28:09.470 --> 28:10.558
for the prosecution

28:10.601 --> 28:12.342
to enter emails into evidence,

28:12.386 --> 28:14.475
so I doubt
we're gonna make it in time.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.433
Uh, hold on, uh, Judge.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.436
Rachel, look, we are very close
to cracking this.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.700
Is there any way you can get us
a little more time?

28:21.743 --> 28:23.353
Nothing that wouldn't violate

28:23.397 --> 28:26.443
the Hawaii Code
of Judicial Conduct.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.968
If this tape comes out,
it comes out.

28:29.011 --> 28:31.448
I have to do what's right.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.800
Thank you both for trying.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.895
All right, we've got 20
minutes. Let's make them count.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.464
What did you call these again?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.901
"45-minute chairs."

28:48.944 --> 28:49.989
Oh.
These are

28:50.032 --> 28:51.730
just samples
that the efficiency expert

28:51.773 --> 28:52.818
brought by.
I'm sure there's others

28:52.861 --> 28:54.820
that are more... More comfortable?

28:54.863 --> 28:58.040
Well, yeah, comfy
but not so comfortable.

28:58.084 --> 29:01.827
Okay, that is a
37-minute chair at best.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.350
So, you don't like any of them?

29:03.393 --> 29:04.351
Hell no.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.787
But my bigger issue

29:05.831 --> 29:08.050
is that you're about to make
a huge mistake, Rick.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.009
The chairs are horrible,

29:10.052 --> 29:11.793
and the contractors
are about to gut

29:11.837 --> 29:13.708
everything that makes
this place special.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.495
Excuse me.

29:20.106 --> 29:24.284
These tikis are
from the Sheraton Kon-Tiki Room.

29:24.327 --> 29:28.331
This is a replica
of the winning canoe

29:28.375 --> 29:30.420
in the very first
Molokai Hoe race

29:30.464 --> 29:31.421
in 1952.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.293
This is not
just a business.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.338
La Mariana is a landmark.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.384
I know.
That's why I bought the place.

29:37.427 --> 29:40.561
Then why would you change
a thing?

29:41.692 --> 29:45.044
Is this the real reason why you
invited her to test the chairs?

29:45.087 --> 29:46.523
Uh, little bit.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.003
Look, come on, man,

29:48.047 --> 29:49.788
I know you're trying
to stay positive about all this,

29:49.831 --> 29:52.094
but we both know
your heart's not in it.

29:52.138 --> 29:55.619
Well, maybe it's time
I start listening to my head.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.404
Look, you guys know
I love this place

29:57.447 --> 29:58.884
just as it is,
but if we don't start

29:58.927 --> 30:00.842
squeezing some serious profit
out of it,

30:00.886 --> 30:03.018
I'm gonna have to go through
with this remodel.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.803
Come on, man.
- There's got to be another way.
- No, no.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.457
It's the smart thing to do. It's
the responsible thing to do.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.156
But it's not
- the you thing to do.
Just because I've been

30:10.199 --> 30:11.505
a dumbass my whole life

30:11.548 --> 30:13.899
doesn't mean
I got to keep being one.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.465
Now, look,
things are changing, all right?

30:15.509 --> 30:17.598
I'm changing.
A-And if I don't change,

30:17.641 --> 30:19.339
I'm not gonna be ready for...

30:20.209 --> 30:22.081
Curtis. What are you doing?

30:22.124 --> 30:24.083
What'd I do?

30:24.126 --> 30:26.172
Nothing. You're fine. I'm sorry.

30:26.215 --> 30:29.044
Look, man, why don't we just... No, I-I need to go talk
to these contractors.

30:30.437 --> 30:33.832
Well, that went well.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.270
Don't panic yet.
I have an idea.

30:37.313 --> 30:40.360
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

30:42.275 --> 30:45.147
Four minutes to 2:00.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.628
- We need a miracle.
- Well, I don't know if it counts as a miracle,

30:47.671 --> 30:48.847
but I have found something odd.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.326
To make sure
that we hadn't missed

30:50.370 --> 30:51.632
anyone off the list
of suspects,

30:51.675 --> 30:53.982
I hacked into the fund's
transaction records,

30:54.026 --> 30:55.462
and I found this.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.116
$100,000

30:57.159 --> 30:58.900
withdrawal. That's the same
amount we think Maya's getting.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.510
Yeah, and it was
taken out two days

31:00.554 --> 31:02.164
before Maya
went to see the madam.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.297
- From whose account?
- Well, that's where it gets really odd.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.777
The money was withdrawn
from Kendall Parson's account

31:06.821 --> 31:08.344
over a year after he was killed.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.652
What about his wife, Anna?
I mean,

31:11.695 --> 31:13.175
she would have access
to the account, right?

31:13.219 --> 31:14.568
Most likely,

31:14.611 --> 31:15.830
but why would the victim's wife

31:15.874 --> 31:17.658
want her husband's killer
to go free?

31:17.701 --> 31:20.226
I mean, they've all known
each other since college.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.315
Maybe they had something
going on. Some kind of affair?

31:22.358 --> 31:25.927
I feel like HPD would have found
evidence of something like that.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.495
Anna would still be
her husband's beneficiary,

31:28.538 --> 31:30.497
which makes her an investor
in the fund.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.675
Maybe she just didn't want
to lose her golden goose?

31:34.718 --> 31:37.634
Or maybe she somehow knows
Reed's not guilty.

31:37.678 --> 31:38.853
Remember what Maya said?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.203
"You don't know
he's the killer."

31:42.596 --> 31:44.293
Could you,

31:44.337 --> 31:46.905
uh, look... Yeah, get into Anna's
cell records? I'm on it.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.866
Pull up the location data
for the night of the murder.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.478
Anna was at her husband's office

31:55.522 --> 31:58.351
30 minutes
before Owen Reed called 911.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.570
HPD questioned her the night of,

32:00.614 --> 32:02.094
but ever since they found
Reed's emails,

32:02.137 --> 32:03.922
they zeroed in on him
and never looked back.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.575
So maybe Reed
is telling the truth.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.795
He did find Kendall dying.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.449
And Anna
just doesn't want him

32:09.492 --> 32:10.841
to go to prison
- for something that she did.
- Which means

32:10.885 --> 32:12.278
we have to stop the judge
before it's too late.

32:14.193 --> 32:17.109
You've reached
- Judge Rachel Park.
- Voice mail.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.285
She's got to be
in session already.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.503
Okay. Better get down there.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.820
You've reached
Judge Rachel Park.

32:32.863 --> 32:33.995
I can't come to
the phone right now.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.605
Even if we could reach her,

32:35.649 --> 32:37.433
I'm not exactly sure
what we would say.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.739
Well, that Anna
may be the killer

32:38.782 --> 32:40.349
and she's about to help
convict an innocent man.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.047
Yes, but it's all
still conjecture at this point.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.571
We still don't have enough
to actually arrest Anna

32:44.614 --> 32:46.529
or to stop
the video coming out.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.188
- Katsumoto.
- Hey, Gordie.

32:53.232 --> 32:56.191
I think it's time we told you
what this whole thing is about.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.547
All rise.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.550
Be seated.

33:09.683 --> 33:12.686
In response
to the defense's objection,

33:12.729 --> 33:15.210
I've reviewed my ruling
on the admissibility

33:15.254 --> 33:16.516
of email evidence obtained

33:16.559 --> 33:18.561
from the defendant's
computer.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.183
For the past few days,
an outside party

33:31.226 --> 33:33.185
has been trying to
illegally influence

33:33.228 --> 33:35.665
my decision
on this key evidence.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.103
Fortunately, HPD is close

33:38.146 --> 33:39.713
to identifying
the people behind this.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.671
As soon as they're
in custody,

33:41.715 --> 33:43.238
this trial shall resume.

33:43.282 --> 33:46.807
Until then,
this court is in recess.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.114
All rise.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.600
Where the hell are you?

33:57.644 --> 33:58.993
Anna? What's going on?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.299
What's going on is I paid you

34:00.342 --> 34:02.214
way too much money
to go down for this.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.085
What the hell
- are you talking about?
The judge.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.392
She just said HPD's onto us.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.872
Hang up the phone right now
and don't call me again.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.745
Got a lock on Maya's burner.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.399
Team 1, move in.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.575
Team 2,
suspect is moving northwest

34:15.618 --> 34:18.447
across Alakea Plaza.

34:20.188 --> 34:23.800
Anna Parsons,
you're under arrest.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.028
Hey, Maya. You remember me?

34:34.985 --> 34:36.335
You're under arrest

34:36.378 --> 34:37.945
for conspiracy, extortion,

34:37.988 --> 34:39.773
obstruction of justice.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.992
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.168
Anything you say can
and will be used

34:43.211 --> 34:44.430
against you in
a court of law.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.866
You have the right
to an attorney.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.737
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

34:50.914 --> 34:52.829
Peace offering.

34:52.873 --> 34:55.528
30 pounds of tropical fruit

34:55.571 --> 34:57.617
just waiting to be swaddled.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.836
I'm sorry about earlier.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.969
This whole
"being a dad" thing

35:02.012 --> 35:04.102
has kind of got me
freaked out."Kind of"?

35:04.145 --> 35:06.278
Okay,
it's really freaking me out.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.279
Of course it is.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.019
You'd be crazy if you weren't.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.021
But the fact that
you're nervous

35:11.065 --> 35:12.284
just means you care.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.807
Yeah, well,
it's just I didn't have

35:13.850 --> 35:15.330
a lot of family support

35:15.374 --> 35:17.985
or financial security
when I was a kid.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.421
I want to make sure

35:19.465 --> 35:21.162
that my kid never has to deal
with any of that.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.946
Look, I get it, man.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.426
You know I do. But
being a good dad

35:24.470 --> 35:27.081
has nothing to do with
what's in your wallet.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.039
It's about what's in there.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.606
And you got that already.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.042
Besides, I think we found another way

35:32.086 --> 35:34.436
to make this place
more profitable.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.003
Who's that?

35:37.657 --> 35:39.093
That is my friend Kea,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.226
an architectural historian

35:41.269 --> 35:44.229
with the Hawaii Register
of Historical Places.

35:44.272 --> 35:47.101
And like you two were
saying, this place is loaded

35:47.145 --> 35:49.190
with historic
furniture and decor.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.323
And it's been in business
two years longer

35:51.366 --> 35:52.889
than Hawaii's been a state.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.761
So, if we can get
La Mariana declared

35:54.804 --> 35:57.546
as a historic landmark,
we'll get a hefty tax break,

35:57.590 --> 36:00.201
and we'll be in all the tour
books and online guides.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.247
And that'll definitely
drive up business.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.509
And without
tearing down one wall

36:03.552 --> 36:05.554
or buying any
of those god-awful chairs.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.905
Okay. All right.
You guys, I'm sold.

36:09.732 --> 36:12.866
Kea? Rick Wright.
Nice to meet you.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.041
Very nice to meet you.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.608
Mm-hmm.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.000
- Boom.
- Boom.

36:25.444 --> 36:28.229
She may have been
hard to catch,

36:28.273 --> 36:29.578
but as soon as I told her
we'd frozen her accounts,

36:29.622 --> 36:31.319
she immediately flipped
on her client.

36:31.363 --> 36:35.236
And like any good fixer,
she recorded everything.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.238
Just couldn't take it anymore.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.067
The late nights. Early mornings.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.070
Always feeling like I
came second to the markets.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.898
So I went to the office,
and told Kendall

36:44.941 --> 36:46.029
I was leaving him.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.335
We argued,

36:47.379 --> 36:50.469
and when I tried to go,
he grabbed my arm. Hard.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.080
I panicked.
Saw the statue on his desk.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.560
I never meant

36:54.603 --> 36:57.389
to hurt him, and I never meant
for Owen to get blamed.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.391
I'm not a bad person.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.001
P.A.'s dropping

37:01.044 --> 37:03.090
all charges against Owen Reed
and charging Anna Parsons

37:03.133 --> 37:04.352
with her husband's murder.

37:04.396 --> 37:05.658
What about Maya?

37:06.441 --> 37:08.704
We've got her
on multiple felony counts,

37:08.748 --> 37:10.140
but since she's cooperating,

37:10.184 --> 37:13.927
I'm guessing she walks
with six months' probation.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.071
After Maya was
arrested, we managed

37:28.115 --> 37:30.248
to find her place
before HPD got there.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.859
We destroyed every copy of
the video that we could find.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.643
Like we said, once something's

37:34.687 --> 37:36.558
on the Internet,
there's no way to make sure

37:36.602 --> 37:37.733
that it's gonna
be gone forever,

37:37.777 --> 37:39.779
so there's no telling
whether or not

37:39.822 --> 37:42.042
this could surface
at some point in the future.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.435
Yeah, I've thought
a lot about that

37:43.478 --> 37:46.176
since you guys first warned me.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.049
I've spent 20 years
living in fear

37:49.092 --> 37:50.355
of this secret coming out.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.704
For the last two days,

37:51.747 --> 37:55.229
I've realized
I'm done living in fear.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.323
Earlier today,

38:02.367 --> 38:03.933
two individuals were arrested

38:03.977 --> 38:07.372
for attempting to extort me
into subverting justice.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.462
To ensure that this
never happens again,

38:10.505 --> 38:13.029
after consulting with my family,

38:13.073 --> 38:14.553
I made the difficult decision

38:14.596 --> 38:18.252
to disclose the reason
behind the blackmail.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.390
I grew up very poor.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.870
In my final semester
of law school,

38:27.914 --> 38:30.177
my scholarship
fell through.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.919
There was no other way
to make enough money.

38:33.702 --> 38:36.749
I went to work as an escort
for three months.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.014
I know this is
the right choice for her,

38:41.057 --> 38:42.407
but I can't help but worry

38:42.450 --> 38:44.278
that this is gonna hurt
her professionally.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.628
Some people
will judge her harshly,

38:46.672 --> 38:49.805
but for my part,
what she's doing takes

38:49.849 --> 38:51.067
integrity, honesty

38:51.111 --> 38:53.331
and a huge amount
of courage.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.768
Well, that just makes me
trust her more.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.045
Okay, that's great.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.786
Thanks for letting me know.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.919
So, Reed's attorney

39:16.963 --> 39:18.747
has agreed to drop
all the charges against us,

39:18.791 --> 39:20.619
which means that the arrest
will be expunged

39:20.662 --> 39:23.186
before it can affect
my citizenship application.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.059
That's great.
Glad everything worked out.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.408
You are...

39:27.452 --> 39:28.975
restocking the fridge.

39:29.018 --> 39:30.629
And...

39:30.672 --> 39:32.631
- What is that smell?
- Oh,

39:32.674 --> 39:35.764
that's, uh...
Uh, vanilla tobacco.

39:35.808 --> 39:39.159
- Like it?
- Yeah. It's not bad, actually.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.248
So, uh, I guess this means

39:41.291 --> 39:43.859
that you and Lia
are gonna give it another go?

39:43.903 --> 39:45.339
No, no. I just figured

39:45.383 --> 39:47.385
Lia's not the only person
that comes here, right?

39:47.428 --> 39:49.822
So I should probably
make it nice for everybody.

39:49.865 --> 39:53.173
Well, that's very
considerate of you.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.001
Appreciate it.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.438
Hey, um, I'm gonna have a Coops,

39:57.482 --> 39:59.397
maybe watch a movie.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.703
I don't know,
want to hang out for a bit?

40:01.747 --> 40:04.358
Uh... Yeah, I would.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.360
I... I'll just
take a rain check.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.449
I, uh, got to look
through the books.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.755
Maya was right about one thing.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.018
This-this job
cost us a lot of money.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.933
Yeah, well, it was worth it.

40:13.976 --> 40:17.980
But if I need to cut back
on scented candles, let me know.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.765
Okay. Will do.

40:19.808 --> 40:22.507
- I'll, uh, see you later.
- See you, Higgy.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.253
Hello?

40:30.297 --> 40:31.646
Hello, Thomas.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.300
Is this the part
where you tell me

40:33.343 --> 40:34.954
I screwed up
and now you're coming after me?

40:34.997 --> 40:36.521
Now, why would I do that?

40:36.564 --> 40:39.175
Because you seem
like the vindictive type.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.786
Mm, I can be.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.919
But in general, I only go
after people when I'm paid to.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.486
I was actually calling

40:45.530 --> 40:47.662
to congratulate you
on a game well-played.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.316
Given the fact
that you call this "a game,"

40:49.359 --> 40:51.927
I'm pretty sure
we're not gonna be friends.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.538
We'll see about that.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.670
You guys took this round,
but I have a feeling

40:55.714 --> 40:57.411
our paths will cross again.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.805
Yeah. It is a small island.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.546
That it is.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.243
I'll see you soon, Thomas.
