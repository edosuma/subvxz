JOY'S HOME NUMBER.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.697

IS HER HOME.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.865

12:34.336 --> 12:36.338

12:36.422 --> 12:38.716
THAT REALLY IS WEIRD.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.969

ALIENS AND THIS NEW GIRL'S
ONE OF THEM.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.430
{\an1}YEAH! MAYBE THE NEW GIRL
IS AN ALIEN IN A FLESH SUIT.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.902
(everyone talking at once)

13:00.863 --> 13:01.614
HI,

13:01.697 --> 13:04.700
I'M NINA. I'M FROM AMERICA.

13:04.783 --> 13:05.868
HEY.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.578
WELCOME SPACE GIRL

13:07.661 --> 13:12.249
OR BLURP BLEEP BLOP AS THEY SAY
IN YOUR LANGUAGE.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.877
SUPPER'S READY.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.594
OH AMBER.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.348
THAT'S MY SEAT.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.724
{\an1}OH, I'M SORRY.
DO YOU WANT TO...?

13:28.807 --> 13:29.558
WHERE'S MICK?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.810
{\an1}UM, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE SO...

13:35.397 --> 13:36.732
YOU HEARD WHAT AMBER SAID,

13:36.815 --> 13:37.650
THAT'S HER SEAT.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.400
{\an3}YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT
HERE RIGHT NOW.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.778
{\an1}THAT'S YOUR WAY
ISN'T IT?

13:40.861 --> 13:44.073
{\an1}SOMEONE'S GONE FOR FIVE SECONDS
AND YOU'VE ALREADY MOVED IN.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.742
PATRICIA IS HEAD OF THE
WELCOMING COMMITTEE.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.036
TAKE NO NOTICE, JUST SIT WHERE
EVER YOU LIKE.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.041
(knocking) MICK? MICK!

13:54.124 --> 13:56.043
{\an3}YEAH?

13:56.126 --> 13:58.212
SERIOUSLY, DON'T DO THAT I
ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.421
SORRY BABES.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.422
{\an1}I WENT INTO SUPPER BUT I WAS
LONELY WITHOUT YOU.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.424
{\an3}I JUST WENT OUT
FOR A RUN.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.842
I GATHERED.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.844
{\an1}WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOCK ON MY DOOR,
I WOULD HAVE COME WITH YOU?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
{\an3}HA HA HA.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.306
WHAT? BECAUSE OF LAST TIME?

14:09.390 --> 14:12.309
{\an1}THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WARN
ME ABOUT THE SWEATING.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.644
THIS TIME I'LL KNOW.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.312
{\an3}SORRY BABES,
I HAVE TO SHOWER.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.566
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER OKAY.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.741
{\an1}STOP IT ALFIE,
THAT'S DISGUSTING,

14:27.825 --> 14:29.243
{\an1}AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
CHOKE ON IT.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.869
BUT IT'S DELICIOUS THIS WAY.

14:30.953 --> 14:35.291
{\an1}ALFIE, DON'T PLAY WITH YOUR
FOOD. HA HA HA HA.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.836
ALFIE! AH!!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.927
REALLY GUYS? EVERY MEAL?

14:47.428 --> 14:50.431
OOPS, SORRY!

14:47.428 --> 14:50.431
AHHH!

14:50.514 --> 14:51.765
CLASSY PATRICIA.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.809
WHAT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.311
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:55.394 --> 14:58.355
{\an6}YEAH. EXCEPT I THINK MY SWEATER
IS SHRINKING TO MY BODY AS
WE SPEAK.

14:58.439 --> 15:02.443
{\an4}SO NINA. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT
JOY'S DISAPPEARANCE?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.986
{\an3}I GUESS WHEN I ACTUALLY
KNOW SOMETHING.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.573
{\an1}OH COME ON. ONE MINUTE I'M
SITTING NEXT TO JOY IN CLASS

15:07.656 --> 15:09.825
AND THE NEXT SHE'S DISAPPEARED

15:09.908 --> 15:10.659
AND YOU'VE TAKEN HER PLACE.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.662
{\an1}BIT OF A COINCIDENCE DON'T
YOU THINK?

15:13.746 --> 15:14.913
I GUESS IT IS.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.166
{\an4}MAYBE SHE'S SNATCHED HER
AND LOCKED HER IN THE CELLAR.
WHOOOOOH!

15:17.249 --> 15:20.794
SHUT UP ALFIE!

15:20.878 --> 15:22.171
WELL?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.965
{\an3}I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
JOY OR HER DISAPPEARANCE.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.593
I'LL GET IT OUT OF
YOU...EVENTUALLY.

15:27.676 --> 15:32.514
NINA, PHONE-CALL FOR YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:32.598 --> 15:33.682
{\an1}NOTHING.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.934
{\an1}JUST NINA SPILLED WATER
EVERYWHERE.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.659
<i>HOW'S HARRY POTTER LAND?</i>

15:52.117 --> 15:53.869
GRAN.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.704
<i>SO GO ON. TELL ME ALL.</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:56.872
<i>WHAT'S IT LIKE?</i>

15:56.955 --> 15:58.374
IT'S...

15:58.457 --> 16:00.959
IT'S GREAT. IT'S JUST HOW I
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.171
<i>MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS YET?</i>

16:04.254 --> 16:07.508
YEAH, SO MANY.
LIKE, SO MANY.

16:07.591 --> 16:12.137
<i>I KNEW YOU WOULD.</i>

16:12.221 --> 16:15.724
<i>ARE YOU OK?</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:18.102
YOU KNOW, GRAN...

16:18.185 --> 16:20.354
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUPPER,
WHICH MEANS DINNER SO UM...

16:20.437 --> 16:23.232
<i>YES, YES. YOU GO.</i>

16:23.315 --> 16:25.567
<i>DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.</i>

16:25.651 --> 16:27.861
I'LL CALL YOU SOON, OK?

16:27.945 --> 16:28.654
<i>ONLY IF YOU'VE GOT TIME.</i>

16:28.737 --> 16:33.075
<i>GET SOME SLEEP HONEY! BYE.</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:43.752
IS EVERYTHING OK?

16:43.836 --> 16:48.841
{\an3}OH YEAH, YEAH, IT'S JUST
ALLERGIES.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.760
YOU GUYS HAVE CATS RIGHT?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.763
NO.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.183
{\an3}UM, MUST JUST BE THIS SOGGY
SWEATER THEN.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.030
{\an3}MARA, DO YOU THINK MICK
IS OVER ME?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.282
NO. I'M SURE HE'S NOT.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.618
{\an4}IT'S PROBABLY JUST YOUR
BIOLOGICAL IMPULSE TRIGGERING
YOUR INSECURITY.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.999
OKAY, WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.627
{\an3}SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THE NEW CHICK THEN?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.297
{\an1}I THINK THE NEW GIRL
LOOKS NICE.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.382
OH REALLY?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.509
{\an1}NO... I MEANT SHE
SEEMS NICE.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.471
COURSE YOU DID.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.182
(knocking)

17:38.265 --> 17:39.600
WHAT?

17:39.683 --> 17:41.602
{\an3}CAN I HAVE JOY'S HOME
TELEPHONE NUMBER?

17:41.685 --> 17:41.977
NO.

17:42.060 --> 17:42.811
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.898
{\an3}CAN I "PLEASE" HAVE
HER NUMBER?

17:45.981 --> 17:48.650
NO. IT IS AGAINST SCHOOL RULES
TO DISCLOSE PERSONAL DETAILS.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.903
{\an6}BUT I REALLY
WANT...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.903
NO!

17:50.986 --> 17:52.404
{\an3}BUT I JUST WANT TO
CALL HER.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.615
NO. NOW GO AWAY.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.784
{\an3}YOU WILL SEND THOSE BACK TO HER
TOMORROW THOUGH WON'T YOU?

17:56.867 --> 17:57.409
YES.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.285
FIRST CLASS?

17:58.368 --> 17:59.870
I HAVE TOLD YOU. YES!

17:59.953 --> 18:03.290
{\an1}NOW FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PLEASE
LEAVE ME IN PEACE.

18:09.254 --> 18:13.175
{\an3}<i>MOSTLY A'S - YOU'RE THE SHY,</i>
<i>RETIRING TYPE.</i>

18:13.258 --> 18:15.135
{\an3}THAT'S HILARIOUS,
JUST SO WRONG!

18:15.219 --> 18:19.681
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT CREEP WON'T
GIVE ME JOY'S HOME NUMBER.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.351
{\an4}AT LEAST SHE SHOULD GET HER
STUFF BACK THE DAY AFTER
TOMORROW.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.437
THAT'S GOOD. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
RING HER THEN.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.151
{\an3}I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO
DO WITH THIS NEWBIE.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.070
{\an3}AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS!

18:33.153 --> 18:34.404
SO YOU'VE MENTIONED.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.739
TEN TIMES...

18:35.823 --> 18:38.200
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

18:38.283 --> 18:40.035
{\an1}NOTHING.

18:40.118 --> 18:44.373
(banging)

18:57.719 --> 19:00.305
MICK, I'VE ONLY GOT ONE EYE ON!

19:00.389 --> 19:00.806
I LIKE THE PANDA LOOK.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.723
AWW! THANKS BUBS.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.559
AND IT'S SWEET OF YOU TO COME
AND SEE ME.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.144
ACTUALLY IT'S...
MARA I'VE COME TO SEE.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.064
ME, MARA?

19:09.147 --> 19:11.108
YEAH, I WAS KIND OF...STRUGGLING
ON THAT BIOLOGY ASSIGNMENT.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.486
AND I WONDERED, SINCE, YOU'RE
THE BIOLOGY BABE,

19:14.570 --> 19:16.697
WHETHER YOU COULD...
HELP ME OUT?

19:16.780 --> 19:19.992
ERM... YEAH. SURE. WHY NOT?

19:20.075 --> 19:21.785
A FRIEND IN NEED...

19:21.869 --> 19:23.245
TOMORROW EVENING?

19:23.328 --> 19:25.414
<i>IT'S A DATE.</i>

19:25.497 --> 19:26.915
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.916
{\an1}YEAH.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.502
CATCH YOU LATER BABE.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.716
WHAT? YOU WANT HIM TO FAIL
BIOLOGY?

19:35.799 --> 19:37.134
PROBABLY NOT.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.012
BUT WHY DOESN'T HE ASK ME TO
HELP HIM WITH HIS HOMEWORK?

19:40.095 --> 19:43.390
{\an5}OK, BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM
ASKING ANOTHER GIRL. EVEN WHEN
IT'S YOU.

19:43.473 --> 19:47.561
AMBER, RELAX, HE ONLY WANTS ME
FOR MY BRAINS.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.731
AND YOU - YOU'RE TEXTBOOK
GORGEOUS.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.524
HE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.484
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT. AS USUAL.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.112
AFTER ALL, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE..?

19:57.195 --> 19:57.821
<i>IT'S TEN O'CLOCK</i>

19:57.905 --> 20:01.283
YOU SHOULD BE DOWNSTAIRS BY NOW.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.201
GOING. GOING.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.372
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY

20:07.456 --> 20:13.879
AND THEN I WANT TO
HEAR A PIN DROP.

20:16.381 --> 20:20.093
I CAN STILL HEAR SOMETHING!

20:20.552 --> 20:23.388
WHAT? WE'VE STILL GOT FOUR
MINUTES!

20:27.351 --> 20:29.019
<i>THREE MINUTES.</i>

20:29.102 --> 20:33.482
OK CAPTAIN CURFEW,
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CA.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.742
MARA, COME QUICK.

20:43.825 --> 20:44.451
WHAT IS IT?

20:44.534 --> 20:46.578
JOY.

20:53.251 --> 20:54.586
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:54.670 --> 20:55.379
CLEANING THE MIRROR?

20:55.462 --> 20:56.505
DIDN'T YOU SEE WHAT WAS ON IT?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.298
STEAM.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.884
{\an5}SHE'S WIPED IT OFF.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.884
WHAT DID IT SAY?

21:00.968 --> 21:02.094
'HELP ME! JOY.'

21:02.177 --> 21:04.888
{\an3}AND SHE'S WIPED IT OFF SO NOW IT
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY!

21:04.972 --> 21:05.722
TAKE IT EASY PATRICIA.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.808
THIS IS WHAT SHE WANTED.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.559
SHE'S INVOLVED, I'M TELLING YOU.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.852
{\an3}I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WHEN I
WIPED THE STEAM OFF THE MIRROR.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.897
EXCEPT FOR MYSELF. I SWEAR.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.942
<i>WHY ARE YOU GIRLS</i>
<i>NOT IN YOUR ROOMS?</i>

21:17.943 --> 21:19.027
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.280
I DON'T WANT TO SHARE
WITH HER.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.782
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL MOVE!

21:23.865 --> 21:25.701
HALF MY STUFF IS IN A PILE ON
THE FLOOR ANYWAY.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.743
OR I CAN JUST SLEEP ON THE
COUCH..?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.079
NOBODY IS MOVING ANYWHERE!

21:29.162 --> 21:31.707
GET TO YOUR ROOMS
IMMEDIATELY.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.217
JOY DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE CALLED
ME BY NOW!

21:42.300 --> 21:45.012
I'M TELLING YOU, SOMETHING HAS
HAPPENED TO HER.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.555
{\an3}PATRICIA GIVE IT A BREAK, YOU'RE
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

21:46.638 --> 21:51.643
JEROME. SOME OF US ARE WORRIED
ABOUT JOY EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.354
{\an1}DID YOU GET ANY RESPONSE TO THAT
EMAIL YOU SENT HER LAST NIGHT?

21:54.438 --> 21:55.230
NO.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.690
{\an1}IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW
WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.525
QUESTION THE NEWBIE,
THAT'S WHAT.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.235
{\an1}SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS PATRICIA.

22:00.318 --> 22:03.155
{\an1}SHE JUST HAS REALLY
BAD TIMING.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.698
WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

22:04.781 --> 22:07.451
{\an3}THAT BUSINESS WITH THE MIRROR?
(Jerome laughs)

22:07.534 --> 22:10.454
{\an3}WHAT? YOU DON'T BELIEVE I SAW
ANYTHING DO YOU?

22:10.537 --> 22:11.997
YES WE DO! IT'S JUST...

22:12.080 --> 22:14.583
{\an1}MICK SAW ALFIE HANGING OUT ON
OUR CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.419
{\an6}NOT EVEN ALFIE WOULD HAVE
THE NERVE TO SNEAK INTO THE
BATHROOM,

22:17.502 --> 22:19.129
AND DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

22:19.212 --> 22:21.757
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE SAME ALFIE?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.633
{\an1}SO WHO DO YOU THINK DID
WRITE IT THEN... JOY?

22:23.717 --> 22:26.261
I DON'T KNOW.

22:26.344 --> 22:30.640
{\an3}MAYBE...MAYBE NINA WROTE IT TO
DRIVE ME CRAZY.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.725
WHERE IS SHE ANYWAY?

22:31.808 --> 22:32.976
GONE INTO SCHOOL EARLY I THINK.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.438
{\an3}OH, SO SHE'S A GEEK AS WELL AS
EVERYTHING ELSE IS SHE?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.857
{\an1}I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE ABOUT
GETTING AWAY FROM US.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.942
{\an1}I MEAN, WE'VE HARDLY BEEN
VERY WELCOMING.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.819
I KNOW. I WAS THINKING
THAT TOO.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.405
I FEEL A BIT MEAN.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.451
OHH!

22:49.534 --> 22:51.411
SORRY...ARE YOU OK?

22:51.495 --> 22:52.204
THAT'S MY HOUSE.

22:52.287 --> 22:56.124
{\an1}ERR... I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S A SCHOOL.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.085
THAT'S MY HOUSE.

22:58.168 --> 23:01.171
OK, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.714
IT KIND OF SUITS YOU.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.802
{\an4}MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE YOU
REALLY LIVE AND I COULD TAKE YOU
BACK.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.679
OH, HERE. YOU'LL GET COLD...

23:09.763 --> 23:11.973
IT'S YOU ISN'T IT?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.768
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.103
I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW....

23:16.186 --> 23:19.898
{\an3}SARAH, SARAH.
MY NAME IS SARAH.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.191
OKAY SARAH...

23:21.274 --> 23:24.236
{\an1}WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE?

23:24.319 --> 23:25.654
I CAN'T GO IN THERE.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.406
{\an3}HE'S WAITING.
HE'S ALWAYS WAITING.

23:28.490 --> 23:32.661
{\an1}ALL RIGHT THEN, UM, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST WAIT HERE,

23:32.744 --> 23:34.663
{\an1}AND I'LL GO AND BRING
SOMEONE BACK.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.747
{\an5}OKAY?

23:34.746 --> 23:35.747
ARE YOU COMING BACK?

23:35.831 --> 23:41.294
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
JUST...DON'T MOVE.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.843
AAGH! STOP IT, PATRICIA.
THAT HURTS.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.302
I NEED THE TRUTH.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.972
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT SNEAK
INTO THE BATHROOM LAST NIGHT

23:52.055 --> 23:53.682
{\an3}WHILE I WAS SHOWERING AND WRITE
ON THE MIRROR?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.059
OW! NO!

23:56.143 --> 23:56.893
{\an3}YOU SWEAR?

23:56.977 --> 23:59.271
OW! YES. I SWEAR.
ON SPROCKET'S LIFE.

23:59.354 --> 23:59.729
{\an3}WHO?

23:59.813 --> 24:00.564
SPROCKET. MY DOG.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.649
I SWEAR ON HIS LIFE I DIDN'T DO
IT.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.652
{\an1}PATRICIA? MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO
ACCEPT THE INEVITABLE.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.988
WHAT'S THAT?

24:08.071 --> 24:11.199
{\an4}SOMETHING SINISTER'S HAPPENED
TO JOY AND SHE'S TRYING TO
CONTACT YOU.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.744
HA HA HA.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.744
WHOOOOOOOH!

24:17.789 --> 24:18.999
I DID NOT KNOW YOU HAD A DOG.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.834
NOPE. ALLERGIC.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.171
(they laugh)

24:24.254 --> 24:26.798
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO
GO WANDERING EMILY.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.342
{\an1}EMILY?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.678
{\an1}SHE'S RATHER CONFUSED,
AS YOU'VE PROBABLY REALISED.

24:31.761 --> 24:34.556
BUT SHE'S NOT NORMALLY A
SPRINTER.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.684
THAT'S ANUBIS HOUSE.

24:37.767 --> 24:38.894
SHE SAID SHE USED TO LIVE THERE.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.396
I DON'T THINK SO,

24:41.479 --> 24:43.732
{\an3}ALTHOUGH WITH SOME OF THESE OLD
DEARS, YOU NEVER KNOW.

24:43.815 --> 24:48.486
{\an3}TRUTH IS, WE KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT EMILY'S BACKGROUND.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.280
(loudly) ISN'T THAT RIGHT EMILY?

24:50.363 --> 24:54.743
{\an1}THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOUT.
I'M NOT DEAF YOU KNOW.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.205
{\an3}HEY! WANT TO WALK OVER TO
CLASS TOGETHER?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.122
SURE. OH, BY THE WAY,

24:59.206 --> 25:02.584
{\an1}I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU THIS
YESTERDAY.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.587
A HALF CHEWED BANANA? WOW.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.297
NO...THIS.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.882
OH MICK. I LOVE IT!

25:08.965 --> 25:10.091
WHAT IS IT?

25:10.175 --> 25:12.260
{\an1}OPEN IT AND SEE.
I BOUGHT IT WHILE I WAS AWAY.

25:12.344 --> 25:12.928
IT'S NOT MUCH.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.097
OH MICK. IT'S SO ME!

25:16.181 --> 25:20.143
{\an3}YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE THINGS
ON MY WRISTS.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.938
HI MICK I WAS...

25:23.021 --> 25:25.232
SORRY, AM I DISTURBING
SOMETHING?

25:25.315 --> 25:26.107
YES.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.107
NO.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.444
OK! I WAS JUST...

25:29.527 --> 25:31.446
{\an6}WONDERING WHAT TIME YOU
WANTED TO WORK ON THAT BIOLOGY
ASSIGNMENT?

25:31.529 --> 25:34.741
{\an1}I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT IF
YOU LIKE MICK?

25:34.824 --> 25:36.701
HA HA HA HA.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.161
IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.205
AW YOU KNOCK ME OUT BABE.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.581
SIX O'CLOCK?

25:41.665 --> 25:42.791
FINE WITH ME.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.459
WE WERE JUST HEADING
OVER TO CLASS.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.337
{\an3}DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH
US MARA-CULOUS?

25:47.420 --> 25:49.714
(whispers) MARA-CULOUS?

25:53.176 --> 25:53.843
{\an1}(knocking)

25:53.927 --> 25:56.972
COME.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.848
YES PATRICIA?

25:58.932 --> 26:00.183
{\an1}I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO JOY.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.270
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO JOY.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.647
{\an3}HER PARENTS DECIDED TO REMOVE
HER FROM THE SCHOOL

26:05.730 --> 26:06.731
{\an3}THAT'S ALL.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.650
{\an1}WHEN YOU CAME INTO OUR
CLASS YESTERDAY

26:08.733 --> 26:10.026
{\an1}YOU SAID "SOMEONE IS HERE
TO SEE YOU".

26:10.110 --> 26:11.027
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.237
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY

26:12.320 --> 26:14.864
{\an1}"YOUR PARENTS ARE HERE
TO SEE YOU"?

26:14.948 --> 26:15.740
WHAT?

26:15.824 --> 26:17.033
UNLESS IT WASN'T HER PARENTS.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.494
NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING SILLY.

26:19.577 --> 26:21.496
{\an1}AND WHY DID SHE LEAVE
HER PHONE BEHIND?

26:21.579 --> 26:22.664
AND WHY HASN'T SHE CALLED ME?

26:22.747 --> 26:25.166
{\an1}AND WHY WOULDN'T HER PARENTS
TELL JOY THEY...?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.585
PATRICIA, CALM DOWN.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.754
{\an3}I'M SURE JOY WILL GET IN
TOUCH IN HER OWN TIME.

26:29.838 --> 26:35.010
AND IF SHE DOESN'T, PERHAPS IT
MEANS, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.553
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.179
TEMPUS FUGIT PATRICIA.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.641
TIME MARCHES ON AND I HAVE A
STAFF MEETING TO PREPARE FOR.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.768
{\an6}EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU PATRICIA.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.768
BUT...

26:43.852 --> 26:46.187
THANK YOU. AND GOODBYE.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.399
BYE PATRICIA.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.319
<i>OK. GROUND RULES.</i>

26:52.402 --> 26:56.364
{\an5}YOU HELP MICK WITH ONE
BIOLOGY ASSIGNMENT AND THEN
THAT'S IT. OK?

26:56.448 --> 26:59.242
OK. IT'S NOT LIKE I
BEGGED TO TUTOR HIM.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.453
MARA. AMBER.
HERE. QUICK.

27:01.536 --> 27:02.829
LOOK AT THIS.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.289
I KNOW, DON'T RUB IT IN.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.373
BAD HAIR DAY.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.917
FORGET YOUR HAIR AMBER.
WHERE'S JOY?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.127
{\an1}DIDN'T SHE GO HOME WITH HER
PARENTS YESTERDAY?

27:09.210 --> 27:12.380
HERE! ON THIS PHOTO.

27:12.464 --> 27:12.672
HMM. SHE'S NOT THERE.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.591
EXACTLY.

27:14.674 --> 27:15.300
WASN'T SHE AWAY THAT DAY?

27:15.383 --> 27:17.719
{\an3}WITH TONSILLITIS
OR SOMETHING?

27:17.802 --> 27:20.347
NO. SHE WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE
NEXT TO ME WHEN THAT WAS TAKEN.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.307
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

27:22.390 --> 27:25.810
{\an3}IT WAS NEARLY 18 MONTHS
AGO PATRICIA.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.938
SHE WAS THERE THAT DAY.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.150
I KNOW SHE WAS.

27:35.653 --> 27:38.823
{\an5}THERE THAT'S BETTER
ISN'T IT EMILY?

27:35.653 --> 27:38.823
NO.

27:38.907 --> 27:43.370
{\an5}NOW, YOU GOT TIME FOR A CUP
OF TEA OR SOMETHING BEFORE
YOU GET BACK?

27:43.453 --> 27:45.080
I DOUBT ANYONE'S MISSING ME.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.041
THANKS. THAT WOULD BE NICE.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.877
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.253
KEEPING THE SECRET.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.756
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.550
QUICK. TAKE THIS.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.219
BUT KEEP IT WELL HIDDEN,

27:59.302 --> 28:01.137
{\an1}OR THEY'LL TAKE IT
AWAY FROM YOU.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.556
{\an1}THEY TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY
FROM YOU IN THE END.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.142
{\an3}OH. I COULDN'T
POSSIBLY TAKE...

28:06.226 --> 28:09.813
{\an1}BUT YOU MUST. IT WILL
KEEP YOU SAFE.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.524
{\an1}THERE'S TREASURE HIDDEN IN
THAT HOUSE.

28:12.607 --> 28:16.444
{\an1}AND ONLY YOU HAVE THE POWER TO
FIND AND PROTECT IT.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.780
BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.867
{\an1}THERE'S DANGER IN THAT
HOUSE. EVIL.

28:22.951 --> 28:27.205
{\an1}IT'S A BAD HOUSE.
A DARK HOUSE.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.165
EVIL? SPOOKY, YES,

28:29.249 --> 28:32.293
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EVIL.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.379
EMILY, I DON'T THINK..

28:34.462 --> 28:35.713
{\an1}SARAH.

28:35.797 --> 28:39.092
{\an1}MY NAME IS SARAH.
AND I KNOW YOU.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.802
{\an3}I'M SORRY.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.763
{\an3}I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MISS
THE PLACE YOU COME FROM.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.683
AND YOU KNOW ME NINA....

28:46.766 --> 28:47.475
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME....?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.270
{\an1}BUT YOU MUST BEWARE THE
BLACK BIRD.

28:50.353 --> 28:51.646
DO YOU HEAR ME?

28:51.729 --> 28:59.863
BEWARE THE BLACK BIRD!!

28:59.946 --> 29:03.074
(echoed) IT'S EVIL. EVIL.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.786
WATCH OUT FOR THE BIRD THOUGH.
WATCH OUT FOR THE BLACK BIRD.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.997
BUT YOU HAVE THE POWER.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.501
WATCH OUT FOR THE BIRD.
WATCH OUT FOR THE BIRD.

29:13.585 --> 29:19.716
(echoed) STOP IT! STOP IT!

29:23.344 --> 29:25.763
CAW, CAW, CAW!

29:25.847 --> 29:33.646
BEWARE THE BLACK BIRDS.
BEWARE THE BLACK BIRDS.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.148
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:35.231 --> 29:38.485
NOTHING.YOU WOKE ME UP.

29:38.568 --> 29:45.074
{\an1}"BEWARE THE BLACK BIRD!"
HA HA HA.

29:45.158 --> 29:48.870
AW ARE YOU SCARED?

29:48.953 --> 29:53.750
{\an1}ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP WITH THE
LIGHT ON NEWBIE?

30:19.275 --> 30:23.071
{\an4}I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN HER
FACE WHEN SHE WOKE UP JUST
COVERED IN FEATHERS.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.573
WAS IT LIKE THIS?

30:23.154 --> 30:25.573
HA HA HA HA

30:25.657 --> 30:26.658
HEY GUYS,

30:26.741 --> 30:28.409
I'VE GOT AN IDEA THAT REALLY
WILL GIVE HER NIGHTMARES.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.786
OH YEAH. WHAT'S THAT?

30:28.493 --> 30:29.786
SSSH!

30:29.869 --> 30:36.459
SLEEP WELL NINA? CAW! CAW!

30:36.543 --> 30:37.585
IGNORE THEM.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.129
I AM.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.382
{\an1}SO WHAT WAS THIS
DREAM ANYWAY?

30:42.465 --> 30:43.800
IT WAS AWFUL.

30:43.883 --> 30:47.345
{\an3}I KNOW THEY'RE MAKING JOKES,
BUT IT FELT SO REAL.

30:47.428 --> 30:50.723
IT FELT... EVIL.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.101
ANYONE SEEN MARA?
SHE'S GOT MY HAIR STRAIGHTENERS.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.894
{\an1}YEAH, SHE'S WITH MICK
IN OUR ROOM.

30:54.978 --> 30:55.645
WHAT?!

30:55.728 --> 30:57.772
{\an3}OH-OH. GREEN-EYED
MONSTER ALERT.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.440
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.608
WHY WOULD I BE
JEALOUS?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.277
WHAT'S THERE TO BE JEALOUS OF?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.571
{\an1}SHE'S...HELPING HIM WITH
HOMEWORK THAT'S ALL.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.448
{\an1}YEAH. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.
AND IT'S COOL.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.868
{\an1}I WOULD HELP HIM, BUT I'M
JUST SO BUSY.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.540
{\an3}I SEE YOU HAVEN'T SNEAKED OUT AT
THE CRACK OF DAWN TODAY?

31:15.623 --> 31:19.085
{\an5}WOW, EVERYONE REALLY DOES KEEP
TABS ON EVERYONE ELSE AROUND
HERE DON'T THEY?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.420
{\an3}FABIAN SAID YOU'D GONE
INTO SCHOOL EARLY

31:20.503 --> 31:22.630
{\an3}BUT THEN YOU DIDN'T TURN
UP AT FIRST CLASS?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.132
NINA WAS HELPING AN OLD LADY
ACCROSS THE ROAD.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.926
LITERALLY.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.638
WE HAD A SURPRISE VISITOR FROM
THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.639
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
WITH OLD PEOPLE.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.101
THEY'RE ALL SO...
OLD AREN'T THEY?

31:35.184 --> 31:37.103
REALLY?

31:37.186 --> 31:38.646
STILL, YOU MUST BE USED TO IT.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.230
TRUDY SAID YOUR GRAN
BROUGHT YOU UP.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.357
SHE DID, YEAH.

31:41.441 --> 31:41.941
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
MUM AND DAD?

31:42.025 --> 31:45.528
OH, AMBER, QUEEN OF TACT.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.238
THEY DIED IN A CAR
ACCIDENT.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.908
OH THAT'S AWFUL.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.579
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. MY GRAN
AND I ARE REALLY CLOSE.

31:54.662 --> 31:58.333
{\an1}SO HOW COME SHE'S PACKED YOU OFF
TO A BIG BAD BOARDING SCHOOL

31:58.416 --> 32:00.001
MILES AWAY FROM HOME THEN?

32:00.084 --> 32:01.753
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SHE WANTED TO
GET RID......

32:01.836 --> 32:04.964
PATRICIA, DON'T BE
SUCH A WITCH.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.174
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT JOY

32:06.257 --> 32:08.343
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO BE TAKING
ALL OF THIS OUT ON NINA.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.261
YEAH, WELL, EVERYONE SEEMS TO
HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT JOY,

32:10.345 --> 32:14.182
EXCEPT ME!

32:17.935 --> 32:18.895
HI!

32:18.978 --> 32:19.812
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:19.896 --> 32:21.522
{\an3}I'M FED UP OF YOU
HANGING OUT WITH MICK,

32:21.606 --> 32:22.106
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG!

32:22.190 --> 32:24.192
THEN TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.026
{\an1}HE'S THE ONE WHO KEEPS
ASKING FOR HELP.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.403
{\an3}... "WITH HIS HOMEWORK"
YEAH, I KNOW.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.072
{\an3}BUT YOU WERE HELPING HIM
ALL LAST NIGHT,

32:29.155 --> 32:31.574
{\an6}AND NOW I FIND OUT YOU'VE BEEN
BUDDY-STUDYING WITH HIM AGAIN
THIS MORNING.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.367
I KNOW YOU FANCY HIM MARA.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.701
I DO NOT!

32:33.785 --> 32:35.620
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

32:35.703 --> 32:36.412
{\an1}NOTHING'S WRONG WITH HIM.
I JUST...

32:36.496 --> 32:38.498
EVERYONE FANCIES MICK.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.749
WHAT MAKES YOU SO DIFFERENT?

32:39.832 --> 32:42.377
{\an1}HE'S GOING OUT WITH YOU...
SO I'M NOT INTERESTED.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.045
{\an3}BUT YOU MIGHT BE IF WE
WEREN'T GOING OUT?

32:44.128 --> 32:45.713
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.383
{\an3}YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
DIFFICULT IT IS

32:48.466 --> 32:50.718
{\an3}BEING ONE HALF OF AN
ALPHA COUPLE MARA.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.220
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.056
{\an3}I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR
VICTORIA BECKHAM.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.271
YOUR BIOLOGY ASSIGNMENTS PLEASE.

33:02.355 --> 33:06.359
AND NO EXCUSES THIS TIME.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.156
{\an1}NICE ONE.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.283
{\an3}YOU'RE SO MUCH CRAFTIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.661
{\an3}AND I ALREADY KNEW YOU WERE A
SCHEMING GOTH-PIXIE.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.205

33:19.539 --> 33:22.083

33:22.166 --> 33:25.128

33:25.211 --> 33:27.588
SORRY ABOUT BREAKFAST.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.881
THAT'S FINE.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.259
{\an3}A LITTLE TEASING HELPS THE TEA
AND TOAST GO DOWN.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.388
{\an5}OH AND THAT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TIME WE WELCOMED YOU INTO SCHOOL
PROPERLY..

33:35.471 --> 33:36.639
THE TRADITIONAL WAY.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.266
WHAT ARE YOU GOING ON ABOUT?

33:38.349 --> 33:43.104
ALFIE, WHY DON'T YOU TELL NINA
ABOUT THE INITIATION CEREMONY.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.063

33:52.697 --> 33:54.824
{\an5}WHAT ARE YOU...?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.824
IT'S OK.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.910
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

33:58.161 --> 33:59.954
<i>I BROUGHT YOU THOSE PHYSICS</i>
<i>NOTES I PROMISED.</i>

34:00.037 --> 34:03.124
AW THANKS MAR,

ASSIGNMENT TONIGHT,

34:05.418 --> 34:07.795
{\an6}WILL YOU GO OVER IT WITH ME
TOMORROW LIKE YOU DID WITH
BIOLOGY?

34:07.879 --> 34:11.215
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.759
SORRY. AM I ASKING FOR TOO MUCH?

34:12.842 --> 34:15.386
{\an1}NO, NO. IT'S NOT THAT.
I LIKE HELPING YOU.

34:15.469 --> 34:19.681
{\an1}IT'S JUST...I THINK AMBER'S
GETTING A BIT JEALOUS.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.641
JEALOUS? OF YOU AND ME...

34:21.726 --> 34:25.521
HA HA HA. THAT'S HYSTERICAL.

34:25.605 --> 34:29.817
{\an1}I KNOW. THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY
IMPROBABLE.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.610
{\an4}BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S LIKE
AND I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY
TROUBLE.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.529
I'LL TALK TO HER.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.864
{\an1}OH NO, PLEASE DON'T,
YOU'LL JUST MAKE IT WORSE.

34:35.947 --> 34:38.201

34:43.246 --> 34:44.706
THANK-YOU.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.333
{\an1}HEY MARA!

34:46.417 --> 34:48.127
{\an1}I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS
YOU KNOW.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.003
I KNOW.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.755
{\an1}JUST TO PROVE I'M NOT ALL
TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.007
{\an1}HERE HAVE THIS AS A LITTLE
THANK-YOU PRESENT?

34:54.091 --> 34:56.260
OH THAT'S LOVELY.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.346
IT'S A FRIENDSHIP
BRACELET ISN'T IT?

34:58.429 --> 35:02.183
{\an1}IS IT? WELL, OK, SURE,
BECAUSE...

35:02.266 --> 35:05.228

35:06.395 --> 35:10.858
SO... NINA'S INITIATION TAKES
PLACE TOMORROW NIGHT OKAY.

35:10.942 --> 35:11.943

OOOOHOOHAHAHA.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.531
ALFIE. CUT IT OUT.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.949
TELL ME, FABIAN.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.409
{\an1}DOES IT GET BORING ALWAYS,
ALWAYS BEING THE ONE WHO'S LIKE

35:20.493 --> 35:23.371
{\an1}"CUT IT OUT" OR "THAT'S
NOT RIGHT" OR "FUN IS BAD."?

35:23.454 --> 35:25.039
NO.

35:25.123 --> 35:25.706
YOU MUST BE MAD.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.125
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO DO?

35:27.208 --> 35:30.211
{\an5}GO UP TO THE SPOOKY ATTIC
AND BRING SOMETHING BACK TO
PROVE SHE'S BEEN.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.212
YOU'RE GOING UP
INTO THE ATTIC?

35:31.295 --> 35:34.132
SURE. WHY NOT? I MEAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S...

35:34.215 --> 35:35.383
TOTALLY HAUNTED.

35:35.466 --> 35:35.800
{\an3}REALLY?

35:35.883 --> 35:37.468
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.179
{\an1}BY THE GHOSTS OF FORMER STUDENTS
WHO WENT UP THERE,

35:40.263 --> 35:42.056
{\an1}NEVER TO RETURN.
HA HA HA.

35:42.139 --> 35:43.891
GETTING COLD FEET?

35:43.975 --> 35:44.642
NOT AT ALL.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.727
LET'S START TONIGHT.
CAN'T WAIT.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.730
{\an1}OH WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE
PLANNED FOR YOU TONIGHT.

35:49.814 --> 35:50.982
I CAN'T WAIT TO
HEAR THIS.

35:51.065 --> 35:51.941
THE KEY.

35:52.024 --> 35:55.111
SHE CAN'T GO UP INTO THE ATTIC
WITHOUT THE KEY.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.155
SHE HAS TO STEAL IT FROM VICTOR.

36:01.659 --> 36:05.329
{\an5}<i>SEE THE BUNCH OF KEYS ON THE</i>
<i>DESK NEXT TO VICTOR.</i>
<i>YEAH.</i>

36:05.413 --> 36:07.707
THOSE ARE THE MASTER KEYS.

36:07.790 --> 36:08.749
{\an3}HE CARRIES THEM WITH HIM
EVERYWHERE HE GOES.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.335
SO YOU'LL NEVER GET THEM.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.672
{\an1}BUT THERE IS A KEY BOX ON THE
WALL JUST BESIDE HIM.

36:14.755 --> 36:20.386
{\an3}YEAH. HE KEEPS A SPARE SET OF
EVERY SINGLE KEY IN THERE.

36:20.469 --> 36:26.350
WHAT ARE YOU LOT LOOKING AT?
HMM?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.644
SIR, WE WERE JUST TRYING...

36:28.728 --> 36:32.940
ADMIRING YOUR COAT.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.359
IS IT VINTAGE?

36:35.443 --> 36:41.199
YES, JUST AS I THOUGHT.
THIS FLOOR...IT COULD...

36:41.282 --> 36:42.658
USE A POLISH.

36:42.742 --> 36:47.830
HMMM. YES. IN THAT CASE,

36:47.914 --> 36:49.415
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO
POLISH IT ALFIE.

36:49.498 --> 36:51.459
{\an3}NO... ER.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.586
COME WITH ME.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.586
I DIDN'T MEAN...

36:53.669 --> 36:56.589
{\an3}I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THE...

37:10.102 --> 37:13.105
{\an3}AMBER, I REALISE YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY BUSY,

37:13.189 --> 37:14.482
{\an3}BUT WE'RE BOTH ON
CHORES NOT JUST ME.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.151
I HATE CHORES.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.195
{\an1}THE WASHING UP MAKES MY
FINGERTIPS GO ALL WRINKLY.

37:19.278 --> 37:23.366
{\an3}I KNOW. IF ONLY THERE WERE
SOME SORT OF GLOVE.

37:23.449 --> 37:28.371
MADE OF RUBBER? THAT COULD
PROTECT YOUR HANDS FROM WATER?

37:28.454 --> 37:30.331
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

37:30.414 --> 37:31.791
WHY?

37:31.874 --> 37:37.755
{\an1}BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME THE
EXACT SAME ONE THAT'S WHY!

37:38.547 --> 37:45.012
OWWW!!! ALFIE! YOU'RE
SUCH A PAIN.

38:04.824 --> 38:08.244
NINA MARTIN,

38:08.327 --> 38:12.415
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:12.498 --> 38:18.045
THIS HAD BETTER BE GOOD.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.385
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN HERE?

38:24.468 --> 38:27.013
UM, I WAS...GETTING...

38:27.096 --> 38:29.015
{\an1}GETTING A CLOSER LOOK AT
CORBIERE.

38:29.098 --> 38:33.561
{\an1}I'M SORT OF AN AMATEUR
TAXIDERMIST...

38:33.644 --> 38:35.312
GET OUT!

38:35.396 --> 38:39.400
{\an1}AND DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU IN MY
OFFICE EVER AGAIN.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.280
{\an3}LUCKY.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.531
VERY LUCKY.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.074
WELL, WE'LL SEE HOW LUCKY
SHE IS TOMORROW NIGHT

38:47.158 --> 38:52.329
WHEN SHE GOES UP INTO THAT
ATTIC.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.210
{\an3}I THOUGHT YOU GAVE ME THIS
AS A TOKEN OF OUR LOVE.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.295
I DID BABES, YEAH.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.338
{\an3}SO WHAT'S MARA'S
BRACELET A TOKEN OF..?

39:01.422 --> 39:04.050
OH. THAT...THAT WAS JUST A
LITTLE THANK-YOU PRESENT...

39:04.133 --> 39:09.972
HERE. YOU CAN HAVE
THIS ONE BACK.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.058
{\an3}IT'S NOT THE BEST
OF MOVES IS IT?

39:12.141 --> 39:15.478
GIVING ANOTHER GIRL THE SAME
PRESENT AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

39:17.396 --> 39:20.316
{\an1}THE CALLS WERE GOING THROUGH
TO JOY'S VOICEMAIL

39:20.399 --> 39:22.860
{\an1}BUT NOW I'M JUST GETTING AN
UNOBTAINABLE SIGNAL.

39:22.943 --> 39:23.778
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

39:23.861 --> 39:25.488
IT JUST MEANS PATRICIA,

39:25.571 --> 39:28.908
{\an5}THAT SHE'S GOT FED UP OF YOU
BOMBARDING HER WITH MESSAGES
AND TEXTS

39:28.991 --> 39:30.618
{\an1}AND SHE'S CHANGED HER
PHONE CONTRACT.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.787
NOT FUNNY JEROME!

39:32.870 --> 39:35.122
ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE,

39:35.206 --> 39:40.211
AND THE MEN AND WOMEN
MERELY PLAYERS.

39:40.294 --> 39:44.048
HEY. MY NAME IS JASON WINKLER

39:44.131 --> 39:46.967
AND I'M YOUR NEW HISTORY
TEACHER.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.969
I'LL ALSO BE TEACHING DRAMA.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.347
YOU'RE MR FLEMING'S REPLACEMENT?

39:51.430 --> 39:56.227
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.856
{\an3}WOW. I AM SO PLEASED HE
HAD A HEART ATTACK.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.317
(everybody laughs)

40:03.400 --> 40:07.446
SORRY. THAT DIDN'T COME
OUT RIGHT.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.658
PRESSURE IS EXERTED ON PART OF A
CONFINED FLUID,

40:10.741 --> 40:15.329
{\an5}THAT PRESSURE WILL BE
TRANSMITTED UNDIMINISHED AND
EQUALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS....

40:15.413 --> 40:19.250
NOW THIS IS THE RESULT IF YOU
APPLY PASCAL'S LAW...

40:19.333 --> 40:21.293
{\an1}THAT'S NICE. DOES IT HAVE
A PHOTO INSIDE?

40:21.377 --> 40:22.545
NO!

40:22.628 --> 40:25.923
I'M SORRY. I WAS ONLY
MAKING CONVERSATION.

40:26.006 --> 40:26.841
{\an1}MR RUTTER,

40:26.924 --> 40:29.552
FARI ARGENTUMS AURUM TACERE.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.679
SILENCE IS GOLDEN.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.722
MR. SWEET...?

40:33.806 --> 40:35.057
YES PATRICIA?

40:35.141 --> 40:38.811
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU
ABOUT THE SCHOOL PHOTO.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.981
{\an1}I FAIL TO SEE HOW THAT APPLIES
TO PASCAL'S LAW.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.191
WHY HAS JOY BEEN ERASED
FROM THE PHOTO?

40:44.275 --> 40:46.735
{\an1}UH-OH...CRAZY CONSPIRACY
ALERT.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.155
{\an1}THAT IS A RIDICULOUS NOTION
PATRICIA.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.156
JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.909
I HAVE YOUR LAST
ASSIGNMENTS HERE.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.370
SAVED BY THE BELL AS THEY SAY.

40:56.453 --> 41:03.627
{\an1}MICK, MICK, I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT TO SAY ABOUT...THIS.

41:04.170 --> 41:08.382
YES! AN A. A BIG, FAT A.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.134
{\an1}I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN ONE
IN PERSON.

41:10.217 --> 41:13.804
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

41:13.888 --> 41:16.557
IT'S ONLY AN A-MINUS, MICK.
GET A GRIP.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.644
BUT...

41:21.937 --> 41:23.939
FABIAN, WAIT.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.482
I'M SORRY IF I ACTED
WEIRD BEFORE.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.861
{\an3}YOU'VE BEEN SO NICE TO ME AND IT
WAS KIND OF...

41:28.944 --> 41:30.321
RUDE?

41:30.404 --> 41:35.451
{\an3}WELL, I WAS GOING TO SAY SNIPPY,
BUT YEAH, OK, RUDE WORKS TOO.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.536
{\an1}IT'S OK.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.914
{\an1}LOOK, YOU.RE NOT SERIOUSLY
GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS

41:39.997 --> 41:43.250
INITIATION NONSENSE ARE YOU?

41:43.334 --> 41:44.752
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, YOU KNOW.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.086
YEAH I DO.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.130
{\an3}I'LL NEVER LIVE IT DOWN IF THEY
THINK I'M SCARED.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.381
YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN YOU LOOK.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.468
ONLY IF YOU MEAN WILLING TO DO
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING TO SURVIVE

41:52.551 --> 41:55.512
IN THE DANGEROUS WORLD OF
ENGLISH BOARDING SCHOOLS.

42:01.977 --> 42:05.272
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

42:05.356 --> 42:12.613
(everyone laughing)

42:12.696 --> 42:16.116
{\an1}THANKS ALFIE! SOME OF US ARE
HERE TO LEARN...

42:16.200 --> 42:17.326
EEEEEEEEEEEE

42:17.409 --> 42:21.288
AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE ALFIE?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.792
{\an3}A MOSQUITO IN A SPIN DRYER.
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

42:24.875 --> 42:28.087
{\an1}NOW SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE SERIOUS...

42:28.170 --> 42:31.173
SHAKESPEARE'S
"ROMEO AND JULIET."

42:31.257 --> 42:34.134
TIMELESS. TRAGIC.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.344
{\an1}TEDIOUS.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.888
SEE. I KNEW I WAS RIGHT. THERE'S
AN ARTICLE IN HERE THAT SAYS

42:37.972 --> 42:39.974
IF YOUR BOYFRIEND ISN'T PAYING
YOU ENOUGH ATTENTION

42:40.057 --> 42:41.934
YOU HAVE TO FLIRT WITH SOMEONE
ELSE TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.186
SWAP PLEASE AMBER.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.523
DO I HAVE TO...SIR?

42:48.482 --> 42:50.067
{\an3}I DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY
WELL HANDLED,

42:50.150 --> 42:51.026
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.821
{\an1}OH NONSENSE. THE KIDS HAVE
FORGOTTEN HER ALREADY.

42:53.904 --> 42:54.655
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.281
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, DAPHNE.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.658
{\an3}YOU USUALLY ARE,
OF COURSE...

42:57.741 --> 42:59.743
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ERIC.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.162
{\an3}IT'S JUST...
JOY WAS SUCH A POPULAR GIRL

43:02.246 --> 43:03.455
{\an3}AND SHE AND PATRICIA
WERE THICK AS THIEVES.

43:03.539 --> 43:07.960
{\an3}AND SHE'S NOTICED
THE PHOTOGRAPH.

43:08.043 --> 43:09.837
AH.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.049
{\an1}"O ROMEO, ROMEO! WHEREFORE
ART THOU ROMEO?

43:14.133 --> 43:16.176
{\an1}DENY THY FATHER AND REFUSE
THY NAME.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.345
IF THOU WILT NOT, BE
BUT SWORN MY LOVE,

43:18.429 --> 43:21.056
{\an1}AND I'LL NO LONGER BE A
CAPULET."

43:21.140 --> 43:24.018
{\an3}"SHALL I HEAR MORE, OR SHALL I
SPEAK AT THIS?"

43:24.101 --> 43:26.562
{\an1}"TIS BUT THY NAME THAT
IS MY ENEMY;

43:26.645 --> 43:30.274
THOU ART ...

43:30.357 --> 43:35.029
THOU ART...TRULY THE YUMMIEST
BOY I'VE EVER SEEN ROMEO.

43:35.112 --> 43:36.113
{\an3}WHAT?

43:36.196 --> 43:39.074
<i>THAT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPT,</i>
<i>AMBER!</i>

43:39.366 --> 43:42.870
HA HA HA.

43:44.913 --> 43:47.374
WOW.

43:48.709 --> 43:53.213
(clock strikes midnight)
