WEBVTT

01:01.625 --> 01:05.541
They say the neon lights
Are bright on Broadway

01:07.958 --> 01:13.750
They say there's always magic in the air

01:15.583 --> 01:19.333
But when you're walkin' down that street

01:19.416 --> 01:23.583
And you ain't had enough to eat

01:23.666 --> 01:30.541
The glitter rubs right off
And you're nowhere

01:40.583 --> 01:43.500
Bro. It's like00 a.m.

01:44.875 --> 01:49.916
They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway

01:52.791 --> 01:59.333
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

02:00.416 --> 02:03.875
But they're dead wrong, I know they are

02:04.583 --> 02:08.666
'Cause I can play this here guitar

02:09.875 --> 02:14.458
I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway

02:19.458 --> 02:22.791
Hi. Hello. I couldn't sleep.
Could you sleep? 'Cause I couldn't sleep.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.375
And good morning to you, Nate.

02:24.458 --> 02:25.583
Slept like a baby.

02:25.666 --> 02:27.541
Today is very low stakes for me.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.041
I'll just be happy
if I get cast in the chorus.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.250
You should have auditioned for a big part.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.500
We should be, like,
nervous about this together.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.458
Yeah, no thanks.
I don't really do rejection.

02:39.916 --> 02:44.541
Anyway, I was just calling
to say "good luck" or "break a leg."

02:44.625 --> 02:46.208
You deserve the lead this year.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.583
You really think so?

02:47.666 --> 02:49.750
I mean, should Wicked
have beaten Avenue Q

02:49.833 --> 02:51.083
at the 2004 Tony Awards?

02:52.125 --> 02:53.291
Obviously.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.458
I rest my case.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.166
Hey. You're up early.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.500
Today is the day, Ma.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.458
Is this sweater trying too hard?

03:08.875 --> 03:10.041
I want my look to say,

03:10.125 --> 03:12.208
"I am honored to have been cast
as the lead role,

03:12.291 --> 03:13.708
"but I wasn't expecting it."

03:13.791 --> 03:16.958
They're posting the cast list
for the school play today.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.375
-Musical.
-Sorry?

03:19.583 --> 03:21.125
Musical. Not play.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.208
Yo-yo!

03:22.291 --> 03:26.625
Anthony, please.
Track bag in the clean laundry. Really?

03:28.708 --> 03:29.708
No cup?

03:30.333 --> 03:31.500
What am I, six?

03:31.583 --> 03:32.833
All right, you two.

03:33.375 --> 03:36.875
Nate, please get going,
the bus is gonna be here any minute.

03:40.541 --> 03:43.333
-Are you wearing lipstick?
-No.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.416
Bro, you're wearing lipstick.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.125
It's lip gloss. Clinical strength.

03:48.833 --> 03:51.833
The pediatrician said
my lip skin is unusually sensitive.

03:51.916 --> 03:55.083
-Did the pediatrician actually say that?
-Work with me here, Ma.

03:57.458 --> 04:00.583
All right, just wait for my truck
to pull out before you leave.

04:00.666 --> 04:03.458
And untuck your sweater.
You're trying too hard.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.333
Ignore Anthony.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.541
Obviously.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.916
Good day, guv'nor.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.000
Tough crowd.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.541
No more girls in this row.

04:48.958 --> 04:50.375
Ha-ha. Super original.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.833
Go on. Ladies first.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.791
Don't touch my rabbit foot.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.708
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.416
Can I have my rabbit foot back?

05:07.500 --> 05:08.666
Sit down, boys.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.625
Better watch your back
in the hall today, loser.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.750
Good news.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.333
Wow, this is an honor.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.291
Wow, I can't believe it.
I'm the lead.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.500
Please, please, please, please.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.625
Better luck next time, Nate.

05:50.541 --> 05:51.750
Thanks.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.500
Congratulations on getting the role
of Abraham Lincoln

05:54.583 --> 05:57.500
in The Unauthorized Rock Musical.

05:57.583 --> 05:58.833
You're gonna be amazing.

05:58.916 --> 06:00.000
Thanks.

06:01.958 --> 06:04.666
Nathan. Did you see the list?

06:07.541 --> 06:08.541
I just...

06:10.625 --> 06:11.875
It's a big role.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.166
The title role.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.250
It's a lot for someone who's never had
a leading role before.

06:19.125 --> 06:23.166
It's hard to get a leading role
when no one will give you a chance. So...

06:25.083 --> 06:28.250
If you'll excuse me,
I need to have a word with my associate.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.708
"Good news"? You texted that
you had "Good news."

06:33.791 --> 06:36.750
Libby, I wasn't even cast
as Lincoln's understudy.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.791
I didn't even get his son. Who's dead.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.666
And, yes, we will have fun
in the chorus together,

06:42.750 --> 06:45.875
but I was cast as a tree, Libby. A tree.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.625
Do you realize
what this says about me, right?

06:48.708 --> 06:52.416
That my parents are right.
I should just give up on my dreams now.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.208
Can I talk yet,
or are you still yelling?

06:55.291 --> 06:56.583
I'm still yelling!

06:57.791 --> 06:59.000
Okay, you can talk now.

06:59.416 --> 07:02.000
Name the best animated movie of all time.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.500
I don't know. Pre-Moana or post-Moana?

07:04.583 --> 07:07.375
Lilo & Stitch, Natey. Lilo & Stitch.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.666
Sorry, I thought we were alone.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.541
-You guys are so weird.
-We know.

07:15.583 --> 07:19.416
Okay. Lilo & Stitch. Cult classic.
I'm intrigued. Go on.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.375
I've got some breaking news
about this weekend.

07:23.458 --> 07:27.916
Whatever it is, it better not involve
any more glitter lip gloss. I'm serious.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.333
Manhattan Island, baby.

07:32.416 --> 07:34.375
It's an open audition.

07:34.458 --> 07:35.500
Tomorrow.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.625
Ever since we were little,
we've been like,

07:37.708 --> 07:39.875
"We should take a road trip
to New York someday."

07:39.958 --> 07:41.666
Just you and me.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.708
So, I had this crazy idea.

07:44.791 --> 07:48.500
They're making Lilo & Stitch
into a Broadway musical?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.083
Wow.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.625
Nate Foster, yes?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.416
Absolutely yes!

07:57.750 --> 08:02.250
Welcome to the first audition
of the rest of your life!

08:07.916 --> 08:11.916
You really think you're going
to drive to New York in a cab?

08:16.666 --> 08:17.708
So?

08:17.791 --> 08:19.458
How would we even get to New York?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.583
Would Stitch pick us up in his spaceship?

08:22.666 --> 08:24.458
Okay, first of all, tone.

08:25.666 --> 08:27.500
Second, no.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.833
We'll sneak away on an overnight bus.

08:29.916 --> 08:32.541
Libby, my mom doesn't even
let me go to Rite Aid alone.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.500
Come on, Foster.

08:34.583 --> 08:35.708
Live a little.

08:36.791 --> 08:40.041
I'd hate to not be your date
to the Tony Awards.

08:42.833 --> 08:48.416
And the Tony Award
for Best Actor of All Time goes to...

08:49.500 --> 08:51.583
Where would you even sleep in New York?

08:53.833 --> 08:55.750
Where would we even sleep?

08:55.833 --> 08:57.791
Hello, what about your aunt?

08:57.875 --> 09:00.333
Oh, good point. Nightmare scenario.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.708
Oh, wow, love her that much, huh?

09:02.791 --> 09:05.541
I thought she was some
big Broadway actress.

09:05.625 --> 09:09.166
She is. And she would report me
to my mom immediately.

09:09.250 --> 09:13.250
They have very antagonistic
Glinda versus Elphaba, act one energy.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.708
You think we're going
to arrive in New York City

09:15.791 --> 09:18.708
and run into your aunt?
In a city of 17 billion people?

09:18.791 --> 09:20.916
With my luck? Yes.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.041
Nate. You didn't even get cast
as Lincoln's dead son.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.250
You don't have luck.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.291
Yo, Natey the lady!

09:30.625 --> 09:32.625
Watch your back.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.208
You know what? Forget New York.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.166
I'm just trying to survive seventh grade.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.666
Well, Nate, that's... Okay.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.166
NATE'When we go to West Virginia...

09:55.250 --> 09:57.333
Hello. Hi.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.916
Oh, my gosh! Are we... Did we get evicted?

10:04.041 --> 10:05.541
-What? No.
-Not yet.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.416
Okay, he's home. Will you guys just spill?

10:08.500 --> 10:09.666
-What's goin' on?
-Boys...

10:11.083 --> 10:14.333
Daddy is taking me away for the weekend.

10:14.750 --> 10:18.833
Somewhere fancy in West Virginia
for our big anniversary!

10:18.916 --> 10:20.458
Surprise!

10:20.541 --> 10:22.750
We can afford "fancy?"

10:22.833 --> 10:24.416
That's why God invented credit cards.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.291
And your mom's been working double shifts.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.541
And so she's earned it.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.791
Daddy had
a really good job interview today.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.958
He's going to land on his feet soon.
But the sitter is tied up, so...

10:33.041 --> 10:35.083
Oh, I'm not watching him this weekend.
No way.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.208
Don't you have an away game tomorrow?

10:37.291 --> 10:39.291
It's not a game, it's a meet.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.666
NATE'You're gonna win it.

10:40.750 --> 10:43.291
One of these days, you're gonna
get that full ride to college.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.916
Don't jinx me, Dad.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.291
You always win!

10:47.250 --> 10:48.250
NATE'He always wins.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.375
I could...

10:51.208 --> 10:53.625
I could stay at Libby's
mom's place tonight.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.916
Could you? Would that be too much trouble?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.958
What? You would never let me
stay the night at a girl's house.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.041
You're not Nate.

11:02.291 --> 11:03.875
Nate's different.

11:15.666 --> 11:17.958
Okay. Let's go over the checklist.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.083
Did you take a series
of selfies at your house

11:20.166 --> 11:22.000
to post on Instagram
at strategic intervals?

11:22.083 --> 11:24.125
Yes, I have over 200 options.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.083
-Did you triple-feed your dog?
-Check.

11:26.166 --> 11:30.041
What do you say if the casting director
asked for our parents' phone numbers?

11:30.125 --> 11:31.458
We give them each other's,

11:31.541 --> 11:34.041
and I pretend to be your dad
if the casting people call.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.333
Correct. But you should probably
pretend to be my mom.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.291
Your voice hasn't changed yet.
Did you pack your headshot?

11:44.291 --> 11:47.250
Nate, that's a wallet-sized school photo

11:47.333 --> 11:49.208
from when you had your worst haircut.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.958
My dad doesn't have a job, Libby.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.625
We don't just have glossy
eight-by-tens ready to go.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.041
Tone.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.416
Okay. Lyft to the bus station
is almost here.

12:06.541 --> 12:08.166
What is happening right now?

12:08.291 --> 12:10.125
I've always wanted to climb out a window.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.791
Like the Tonight duet, on the fire escape,
in West Side Story.

12:14.541 --> 12:17.208
You want to break your ankle
before we get to this audition?

12:22.416 --> 12:23.791
Hey, Lib?

12:25.250 --> 12:27.166
Why are you doing all this for me?

12:28.375 --> 12:31.041
Because, it damages my clout,

12:31.125 --> 12:34.291
when my best friend isn't even cast
as Abraham Lincoln's understudy.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.416
And I figured you could use the mood lift.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.000
Plus, my love language
is quality time, so...

12:41.625 --> 12:43.958
Did you just say you love me?

12:44.916 --> 12:48.416
The Lyft's going to be here
in, like, 12 seconds. Go.

12:56.666 --> 13:00.416
This is probably good practice
for the New York City transit system.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.250
Yeah, it is.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.333
How much were the bus tickets?
I'll Venmo you.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.291
You can pay me back
when you're a big Broadway star.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.208
Okay, folks...

13:10.291 --> 13:13.708
Also, I'm using your shoulder as a pillow
and you're dealing with it.

13:13.791 --> 13:16.875
My name is Elliot
and I will be your driver

13:16.958 --> 13:19.625
on route to New York City.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.500
Hey...

13:23.833 --> 13:25.833
-So, when we get there...
-Mmm-hmm.

13:26.166 --> 13:31.125
I know you kind of think of Times Square
as the 1950s Guys and Dolls fantasia,

13:31.208 --> 13:34.916
but people don't actually dance
in the street. They mug you.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.125
Hey.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.791
We may be small, but...

13:38.583 --> 13:39.875
But what?

13:39.958 --> 13:41.625
I'm trying to think of something.

13:41.708 --> 13:42.750
Exactly.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.000
Okay. Good evening, folks.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.833
Once again, my name is Elliot...

14:03.916 --> 14:05.125
Goodbye, Pittsburgh.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.958
New York City
will be the last stop tonight.

14:11.625 --> 14:15.375
So, sit back and please enjoy your ride.

14:16.416 --> 14:19.291
New York coming, people. Last stop.

14:19.416 --> 14:23.958
Last stop. Last stop. Last stop...

14:31.375 --> 14:34.541
I got my ticket in my pocket

14:35.125 --> 14:37.625
I got my heart here on my sleeve

14:39.000 --> 14:41.791
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I got this

14:42.625 --> 14:45.041
They're gonna regret doubting me

14:46.416 --> 14:49.666
The lights are bright, people are crazy

14:50.208 --> 14:52.500
I see it all through my window

14:53.833 --> 14:57.000
Buildings are tall, it doesn't faze me

14:57.625 --> 15:02.833
Don't gotta worry 'cause
I know, I know, I know that

15:02.916 --> 15:06.666
This is where I'm supposed to be

15:06.750 --> 15:09.875
I might be young, but I'm mighty

15:09.958 --> 15:11.833
So let the talkers talk

15:11.916 --> 15:13.541
They can say what they say

15:13.625 --> 15:17.250
They're gonna see my name in lights up
On the marquee one day

15:17.625 --> 15:21.291
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

15:21.375 --> 15:25.833
I might be small, but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

15:27.625 --> 15:30.000
I'm headed to the big time

15:30.291 --> 15:31.458
Ooh yeah

15:33.000 --> 15:35.750
People are staring as I walk by

15:35.833 --> 15:36.833
Walk by

15:36.916 --> 15:39.458
They wonder if I've gone insane

15:39.541 --> 15:40.625
You crazy

15:40.708 --> 15:43.291
But I'll brush off every side eye

15:44.625 --> 15:46.541
Walk with a smile on my face

15:46.625 --> 15:47.958
'Cause I know, I know that

15:48.041 --> 15:51.791
This is where I'm supposed to be

15:51.875 --> 15:54.750
I might be young, but I'm mighty

15:54.833 --> 15:56.916
So let the talkers talk

15:57.000 --> 15:58.666
They can say what they say

15:58.750 --> 16:02.125
They're gonna see my name in lights up
On the marquee one day

16:02.541 --> 16:05.958
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

16:06.041 --> 16:10.500
I might be small, but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

16:10.583 --> 16:12.583
Headed to the big time

16:12.666 --> 16:14.291
I'm headed to the big time

16:14.375 --> 16:16.375
Headed to the big time

16:40.500 --> 16:43.333
I'll make you proud of me

16:43.416 --> 16:46.833
I swear I'm working hard

16:46.916 --> 16:48.750
I'm almost there

16:48.833 --> 16:53.083
And if I prove my worth
And prove everyone wrong

16:53.166 --> 16:57.625
Well, maybe then
I'll finally feel like I actually belong

16:57.708 --> 17:02.541
'Cause if I make it big
I won't get left behind

17:02.625 --> 17:06.291
So, yeah, I'm small, but I'm

17:08.083 --> 17:11.250
-This is where I'm supposed to be

17:11.333 --> 17:14.583
I might be young, but I'm mighty

17:14.666 --> 17:16.625
So let the talkers talk

17:16.708 --> 17:18.250
They can say what they say

17:18.333 --> 17:22.208
I'm gonna see my name in lights
Up on the marquee one day

17:22.291 --> 17:25.750
I'm a do what I do
Make the city mine

17:25.833 --> 17:30.750
I might be small, but I'm
I'm headed to the big time

17:36.083 --> 17:37.916
I'm headed to the big time

17:38.166 --> 17:39.625
Nate. Nate.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.958
-Nate.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.333
-Nate!
-Big time.

17:44.416 --> 17:47.333
You were drooling and singing.
It was incredible.

17:48.708 --> 17:49.708
Look.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.166
It's great.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.750
It's glorious.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.541
Operation Broadway, step two.

18:16.541 --> 18:17.625
Oh! Post that one.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.166
Where you're clipping your dog's nails
in your kitchen.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.708
You look especially innocent.

18:21.791 --> 18:23.041
Tourists.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.291
Thank you!

18:26.458 --> 18:27.583
Oh, no!

18:30.208 --> 18:31.208
Come on!

18:43.291 --> 18:45.000
Maybe we should just turn around.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.333
My hair doesn't do wet.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.625
We just got here. Live a little.

18:48.875 --> 18:52.375
Oh, look at you quoting me. I'll allow it.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.791
Hello. We are here to audition
for Lilo & Stitch.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.083
The musical. The Broadway musical.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.583
First time in New York.

19:06.666 --> 19:09.500
-Yeah, how could you...
-That wasn't a question.

19:12.416 --> 19:13.541
Go on.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.458
And what do we say
if they ask how old we are?

19:37.541 --> 19:40.916
I say, "However old the character
Lilo is in the script."

19:41.000 --> 19:42.291
And then I wink.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.458
Okay.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.291
The casting director!
This is so cool!

19:51.375 --> 19:52.791
Let's cast a musical.

20:00.041 --> 20:05.750
We are expecting 1,000 kids
in the next 24 hours,

20:05.833 --> 20:09.291
so, I need the first 25 kids
to look at their numbers

20:09.375 --> 20:14.625
and line themselves up against
this mirrored wall in ascending order.

20:14.708 --> 20:17.041
I didn't realize
there'd be math on this test.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.875
And just a reminder.

20:19.041 --> 20:23.291
You must indicate in the application
if you are allergic to macadamia nuts,

20:23.375 --> 20:25.000
Hawaii. Big subplot.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.375
Amateur.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.291
And most important,

20:35.375 --> 20:38.166
if you are under 18,
I need you to sign in

20:38.250 --> 20:42.125
with a physically present parent
or guardian today,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.625
or you will not be auditioning.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.666
No "ifs," "ands," or "buts."

20:51.041 --> 20:52.375
-Next.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.958
You ready to set some records, bro?

20:59.041 --> 21:00.666
Yeah. For sure.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.208
You good?

21:12.916 --> 21:15.541
I feel like I'm missing something.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.708
Whatever, let's bounce.

21:29.666 --> 21:33.291
How's Gibby doing?
Actually don't tell me.

21:36.958 --> 21:38.583
You have a cell phone down here?

21:38.666 --> 21:40.666
You're not supposed to have
a cell phone here.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.291
Look what Natey just posted.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.958
He's clipping the dog's nails.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.208
There you go.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.458
Our boys can survive
for one weekend without us.

21:51.541 --> 21:54.416
Now let's please try to relax...

21:56.500 --> 22:00.416
It's the tricep again, ma'am.
You gotta lay off the triceps.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.208
-Don't forget to breathe.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.958
Try not to hyperventilate.
We'll figure something out.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.833
You don't have
your lucky rabbit foot.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.375
Jimmy Madison took it.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.625
I hope karma hits him
in the form of a bus.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.625
I mean, a metaphorical bus,

22:20.916 --> 22:24.333
obviously, I'm against violence
at a core level, but...

22:24.416 --> 22:28.833
You're distracting my kid.
She needs to concentrate.

22:28.916 --> 22:32.125
His blood sugar's low, show some respect.

22:33.208 --> 22:35.375
Have you done character work before?

22:35.458 --> 22:37.708
Have I... I'm sorry, what?

22:37.791 --> 22:40.625
Have you done
costume character work before?

22:40.708 --> 22:45.333
I played a snow-man in a full body suit
in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.000
Twice.

22:47.541 --> 22:50.291
I turned it down the third year,
so I wouldn't be pigeon-holed

22:50.375 --> 22:51.583
as not having a face.

22:51.666 --> 22:54.041
That's incredible.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.041
Yes. Yes, it is.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.166
Good luck!

22:57.916 --> 23:00.125
You're supposed to say, "break a leg."

23:00.208 --> 23:01.250
Next!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.416
Are you here for the audition?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.208
Funny you should ask that, madam.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.666
You bet! We drove all night to be here.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.375
I mean, we didn't drive. My mom did.
We're children.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.458
I mean, if you needed us
to learn to drive a car for the show

23:15.541 --> 23:17.541
for any reason, we're very fast learners.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.083
Really?

23:19.166 --> 23:23.000
Because the competition
seems to think you're flying solo.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.750
First group of kids are on deck.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.000
One sec.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.833
Uh, listen up, everybody.

23:32.916 --> 23:36.333
Unless you have a parent
or guardian with you,

23:36.416 --> 23:41.041
please do not waste your time, or ours.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.375
Nathan.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.541
Foster?

23:48.208 --> 23:49.958
Aunt Heidi.

23:50.041 --> 23:53.250
It is you. Okay. Okay.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.333
We're with her.

23:55.416 --> 23:57.375
This is incredible.

23:57.583 --> 24:00.958
I was this close
to not even coming to this audition today.

24:01.041 --> 24:05.208
And then something in me was like,
"Do it, Heidi,"

24:05.333 --> 24:06.333
and then, this.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.125
-It's like, you're a sign.
-Thank you.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.916
I've been called many names in my life,
but "sign" is a first.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.375
Wait. You're auditioning
for Lilo & Stitch too?

24:16.458 --> 24:18.166
Oh, no. Oh, no.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.875
I'm... No, I'm two doors down.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.625
Yeah. Did you see all those ladies
trying to still pass for mid-thirties?

24:23.708 --> 24:27.958
Yeah, we're all up for the same play.
It's called A Solitary Woman.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.166
Perfect for it.

24:30.791 --> 24:32.125
So...

24:32.250 --> 24:35.125
Yeah. So, where is your mom?
Is she in the bathroom or?

24:37.833 --> 24:39.000
All these years

24:39.083 --> 24:43.250
of her judging me for following my dreams
and being the black sheep,

24:43.333 --> 24:45.708
and she's bringing you to an audition?

24:45.791 --> 24:47.791
Ah! Love it.

24:48.291 --> 24:51.958
And I love that you're still acting.
I'm not surprised. I'm not.

24:52.041 --> 24:55.250
Because you were the only toddler
whose first word was "Me."

24:57.083 --> 24:59.250
Isn't that funny? Is this your girlfriend?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.708
-No!
-We haven't chosen a label

25:00.791 --> 25:03.166
-at this point in our relationship.
-Okay.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.250
I'm just so happy to see you.

25:06.958 --> 25:07.958
Mom's not here.

25:08.583 --> 25:09.708
-Nate!
-What?

25:09.791 --> 25:11.666
It was bound to come out
in three minutes.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.291
Wait! So... But okay.
What do you mean she's not here?

25:14.375 --> 25:15.791
So who brought you? Your dad?

25:15.875 --> 25:19.000
No! He thinks Broadway
is a four letter word.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.333
Okay, wait.

25:20.416 --> 25:23.541
-So you're telling me...
-We ran away from home, lady.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.208
Oh.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.166
Um...

25:27.541 --> 25:28.666
Right, okay.

25:30.250 --> 25:33.875
All right, so, yeah,
responsible adult mode.

25:35.250 --> 25:38.166
My greatest acting role yet.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.916
Um... Whoo!

25:42.625 --> 25:45.041
"Hi, Sherrie, it's your sister.

25:45.958 --> 25:48.083
"I know, it's been a couple years.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.000
"Okay, ten, I guess..."

25:51.958 --> 25:53.833
Why don't I have your mom's cell?

25:53.916 --> 25:56.250
'Cause it's been a while
since you've spoken.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.541
Heidi didn't show up
to my parents' wedding.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.500
She was the maid of honor and everything.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.041
Wow, that's deep.

26:02.375 --> 26:03.666
Yeah, well...

26:06.583 --> 26:09.708
And I just missed my audition,

26:09.791 --> 26:12.375
so, that's awesome.

26:12.458 --> 26:15.666
I can't believe
you still have to audition for things.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.208
You've been on Broadway.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.958
You have no idea, kid.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.291
All right, What's your mom's cell?
Spill it.

26:22.375 --> 26:27.875
It's 4-1-2-5-5-5-8-7-2-0.

26:28.833 --> 26:30.708
Zero. Okay.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.333
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.

26:38.416 --> 26:40.833
At the tone, please record your message.

26:41.875 --> 26:47.583
Hi, Sherrie. I'm with my nephew.
Your son, Nathan.

26:47.666 --> 26:49.666
-Nate.
-Nate.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.750
He is alive.

26:51.833 --> 26:55.125
Well, he's 12 seconds away
from being murdered by his aunt.

26:55.791 --> 26:57.083
But, you know, he's fine.

26:57.166 --> 27:02.291
He is fine and I'm gonna get him
on the next airplane...

27:02.375 --> 27:05.000
-Bus. We can't afford an airplane.
-...home.

27:05.083 --> 27:08.791
And, you know, maybe someday,
we can all laugh at this.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.750
If there is a world
where we ever speak again.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.625
Okay, bye-bye, now.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.958
Incredible work.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.250
Excuse me?

27:29.333 --> 27:31.625
I truly believed you cared about her.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.416
I'm with Nate, I can't believe
you have to audition for things.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.541
Please.

27:35.625 --> 27:38.416
Okay, first group
of kids for Lilo! Let's do this.

27:41.208 --> 27:42.833
All right, let's get outta here.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.250
-Oh! Oh!
-What's this?

27:46.791 --> 27:48.500
It's his pee dance. It's a thing.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.666
Libby!

27:49.750 --> 27:52.833
Okay, well, just go fast, okay?

27:52.916 --> 27:55.000
-That's not good for your bladder.
-Go!

27:56.958 --> 27:59.958
-Is he always like this?
-Hilarious? Yes.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.166
Takes after me.

28:03.166 --> 28:06.791
Do I have everybody?
Where's number 13?

28:16.250 --> 28:17.333
Where's the bathroom?

28:17.416 --> 28:18.625
-Back in the left.
-Cool.

28:26.708 --> 28:30.000
Today, we're not looking for people
to act opposite a puppet.

28:30.833 --> 28:34.500
The role of Stitch
will require a versatile child

28:34.583 --> 28:38.291
whose performance will need
to read through a full bodysuit.

28:39.291 --> 28:42.291
We are seeking both a Lilo and a Stitch.

28:43.250 --> 28:46.666
If you can dance in either of these roles,
all the better.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.375
And you cannot be afraid of heights,
I should add.

28:50.458 --> 28:54.583
There will be a big, power ballad moment

28:54.666 --> 28:58.208
that takes place
literally above the audience's head,

28:58.291 --> 29:01.458
where Stitch pilots the plane
through the mountains of Honolulu.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.416
Yeah, thank you.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.666
-You don't want something to eat, do you?
-I'm good.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.041
-Good. Okay.
-Yeah.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.458
Let's try that again.

29:32.041 --> 29:34.958
Imagine you're seeing
a blue dog-like alien

29:35.041 --> 29:38.125
for the first time in your life
and it makes you scream.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.875
Yeah... No. For sure. Hard agree.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.416
Before I make
the first cut,

29:51.500 --> 29:54.250
does anyone have a special skill
they'd like to demonstrate?

29:54.333 --> 29:56.708
"Make the first cut."
All we did was scream.

29:56.791 --> 29:58.375
I am an award winning tumbler.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.416
Is that so, number six?

30:00.500 --> 30:03.500
Yes. I'm the reigning
Junior Mister Northeast Flipper.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.583
Fine. Any other Mary Lou Rettons
in the room?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.208
Oh, uh, Garret.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.875
I can sorta dance.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.541
I mean, not like that,
that was ridiculous.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.541
But I can do knee crawls.

30:35.916 --> 30:36.916
Knee crawls?

30:37.125 --> 30:39.458
Yeah, like Fiddler on the Roof style
knee crawls.

30:40.541 --> 30:44.291
I was a bottle dancer
in an off-off Broadway production.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.208
In my friend's basement.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.791
In Pittsburgh.
I'm going to shut up now.

30:49.583 --> 30:51.000
Give him a chance.

30:52.750 --> 30:53.875
Well,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.416
this, I have to see.

30:55.541 --> 30:57.708
Okay, pretend I have a bottle on my head.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.875
-Got it.
-And a beard.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.541
Mazel tov!

31:05.208 --> 31:07.500
-Oh, my gosh! My pants!
-Your pants?

31:07.583 --> 31:10.541
Yeah, I got caught in the rain
and I think my pants shrunk

31:10.625 --> 31:13.541
and now they're way too tight for me
to do my knee crawl things.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.833
Does anybody have any extra shorts?

31:15.916 --> 31:18.458
That won't be necessary.

31:18.541 --> 31:22.041
For the record, I have a ton of phobias,
but heights isn't one of them.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.541
I think we can make the cut.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.625
-Good try.
-Thanks, number 12.

31:34.166 --> 31:37.541
Okay, I'm gonna say this one more time.

31:37.625 --> 31:41.958
This is not personal.
And you're all sensational.

31:42.041 --> 31:47.041
It's like I'm looking at
Juilliard Drama class of 2027.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.416
All right. If I don't read your number,

31:52.500 --> 31:54.333
I will see you on...

31:54.416 --> 31:57.458
The next one.
Like there will even be a next one.

31:57.541 --> 32:00.750
Cut at my first and last
Broadway audition.

32:00.833 --> 32:03.166
That's going to be
the name of my memoir title.

32:03.250 --> 32:06.083
Hey. At least you got to audition, right?

32:06.166 --> 32:08.375
Yeah. By breaking into the audition

32:08.458 --> 32:11.166
and lying to your aunt, by the way.

32:11.250 --> 32:14.416
Okay, it is so weird to me
that your mom's only response

32:14.500 --> 32:16.583
to my voicemail is a thumbs up emoji.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.125
That's not so weird.

32:18.208 --> 32:21.416
And it's an African-American
thumbs up emoji.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.708
Her hand must have slipped.

32:25.750 --> 32:28.500
- Good afternoon.
- 00 p.m. to Pittsburgh now boarding.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.583
00 p.m. to Pittsburgh.

32:31.541 --> 32:34.541
Well, I may have missed my audition,

32:34.625 --> 32:38.625
but I refuse to miss the most
well-paying Bar Mitzvah in U.S. history,

32:38.708 --> 32:39.875
so I should go.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.458
Wait, you're a rabbi now?

32:41.958 --> 32:43.208
Ha. Ignoring that.

32:43.291 --> 32:46.083
No, I have to be at the Natural
History Museum in 20 minutes.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.833
Ah. Yes, dinosaurs.

32:48.916 --> 32:52.208
Well, I'm just catering.
So, don't be jealous.

32:53.208 --> 32:55.666
I would trade my entire life
with you right now,

32:55.750 --> 32:57.666
if I could be a caterer in New York.

32:58.416 --> 33:02.875
One day, Nate, I have complete confidence
that you'll be a caterer in New York.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.416
In the meantime,
middle school is calling your name.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.875
-For the record...
-Yeah?

33:16.041 --> 33:18.458
I totally understand why
you missed the wedding.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.500
You had your first-ever Broadway callback.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.875
I would have done the same thing.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.958
I... Uh...

33:29.916 --> 33:31.041
Um...

33:31.125 --> 33:32.208
Tell...

33:36.000 --> 33:38.208
I gotta go. What am I doing? All right.

33:40.166 --> 33:43.083
You two...
You take care of each other, right?

33:46.333 --> 33:48.208
Yes, good. Good.

33:54.208 --> 33:57.625
- Final boarding- 00 p.m.
Port Authority to Pittsburgh.

33:57.708 --> 33:58.833
Final boarding.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.958
So if I'm reading the room,

34:11.041 --> 34:14.625
Kalea is our top contender for Lilo.

34:14.708 --> 34:18.500
Adore her energy.
She is already on vocal rest.

34:19.250 --> 34:22.041
So, this is that afternoon
callback group then.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.208
Yes!

34:25.625 --> 34:26.791
Hold on!

34:28.208 --> 34:29.208
Where's the kid?

34:29.416 --> 34:32.291
Which kid? These are all kids.

34:32.375 --> 34:33.541
The weird funny one.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.208
The Fiddler on the Roof bottle dance boy?

34:37.291 --> 34:38.333
You liked that kid?

34:38.416 --> 34:40.250
He was like my favorite kid.

34:40.333 --> 34:43.458
He referred to Pittsburgh
as "off-off Broadway."

34:43.541 --> 34:45.000
He was spunky.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.500
I don't think we even
got his contact info. So...

34:47.583 --> 34:52.500
Not true! His friend left this with me.
Phone number's on the back.

34:56.500 --> 35:02.083
That is the worst haircut
I've seen in 32 years of casting.

35:04.375 --> 35:06.291
Well, today could have been better.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.208
Today could have been worse.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.416
Driver, stop the bus!

35:30.500 --> 35:31.791
What are you doing?

35:31.875 --> 35:35.000
I got a callback.
I have to be there in like 20 minutes.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.750
You got a... Wait, what?

35:38.208 --> 35:39.625
Hello? Someone getting off?

35:40.541 --> 35:42.333
This wasn't a part of the plan.

35:42.416 --> 35:44.583
But we do everything together!

35:44.666 --> 35:46.333
Which is exactly my point!

35:46.541 --> 35:48.125
Tone.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.583
If I'm gone any longer,
and my parents figure it out,

35:53.666 --> 35:55.750
they're going to ground me. For life!

35:55.833 --> 35:56.958
Are you...

35:57.041 --> 35:59.583
Libby, are you mad
that I auditioned without you?

35:59.666 --> 36:01.291
No. I...

36:01.375 --> 36:03.750
Nate, I love the theater.

36:03.833 --> 36:06.875
But I don't really love being onstage.

36:06.958 --> 36:09.166
I'm still trying to find my thing.

36:10.250 --> 36:14.250
And I kind of only do the school shows
to be with...

36:15.583 --> 36:16.750
You know?

36:19.500 --> 36:21.000
With you.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.541
Make a decision, kids.

36:27.791 --> 36:31.125
Libby, you know how much
you mean to me,

36:31.958 --> 36:34.708
but I'm not like that.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.375
Honey, let him go.

36:44.166 --> 36:46.458
I'll explain to you on the ride home.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.958
Are you stayin' on,
or are you gettin' off?

36:51.958 --> 36:54.000
I'm really sorry, Lib.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.458
No, I...

37:00.541 --> 37:02.208
I've been there, sweetheart.

37:02.291 --> 37:04.125
And I married the guy!

37:26.583 --> 37:27.791
The rabbit foot worked!

37:34.958 --> 37:37.291
Nate! You still at Libby's?

37:38.125 --> 37:39.333
I'm home!

37:40.166 --> 37:43.375
Hey, do we have any Ace bandages
in dad's medicine cabinet?

37:45.208 --> 37:46.208
Yo!

37:47.041 --> 37:48.041
Nate!

37:59.125 --> 38:00.208
Ow!

38:06.916 --> 38:08.208
"Hanging with Lib.

38:08.291 --> 38:10.875
"Congrats on probably
getting first place."

38:10.958 --> 38:12.791
First place. Yeah.

38:19.666 --> 38:22.375
-Dude. Party tonight.
-Dude,

38:22.458 --> 38:25.208
-I can barely walk.
-That's why we're coming to you.

38:25.541 --> 38:28.166
We want to cheer you up
for biffing out there today.

38:28.250 --> 38:31.000
Aren't your parents away
on their woo-woo retreat thing?

38:31.083 --> 38:32.791
-Dude, I don't know.
-Dude...

38:32.875 --> 38:35.208
Can I come make your boo-boo better?

38:36.875 --> 38:39.125
Yeah, okay, it's on.

38:39.458 --> 38:40.833
Yes.

38:42.166 --> 38:43.458
All right, later.

39:09.666 --> 39:10.666
Weird.

39:13.500 --> 39:17.916
Let the storm rage on!

39:18.000 --> 39:21.250
The cold never bothered me anyway

39:23.875 --> 39:27.416
I've never had a boy sing Let It Go,
I'll give you that.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.916
Thank you so much.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.583
Crazy question, Nate,

39:31.666 --> 39:34.416
but did you happen to bring
a monologue with you today?

39:35.125 --> 39:38.083
-Monologue?
-Yeah, like a short speech.

39:38.166 --> 39:40.041
Emphasis on "short."

39:40.125 --> 39:43.750
Oh, no, I know what a monologue is.
I just didn't...

39:43.833 --> 39:46.208
Okay, no problem. That's all we need.

39:46.291 --> 39:48.500
Wait. I have something. I do.

39:51.958 --> 39:55.083
"The night the lights
went out in Georgia."

39:56.625 --> 39:59.958
Can't say I've heard of that one,
but if you wanna give it a try...

40:00.041 --> 40:01.875
"You probably didn't know, Marjorie,

40:02.458 --> 40:06.625
"that Suzanne was the only contestant
in Georgia pageant history

40:06.708 --> 40:11.791
"to sweep every category
except congeniality,

40:11.875 --> 40:15.750
"and that is not something
the women in my family aspire to anyway.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.875
"Or that when she walked down
the runway in her swimsuit,

40:20.958 --> 40:24.750
"five contestants quit on the spot.

40:24.833 --> 40:28.250
"Or that when she emerged
from the isolation booth

40:28.333 --> 40:31.375
"to answer the question,
'What would you do to prevent war?'

40:31.458 --> 40:35.541
"she spoke so eloquently of patriotism,

40:35.625 --> 40:39.791
"battlefields, and diamond tiaras,
grown men wept."

40:40.625 --> 40:41.958
Okay.

40:42.041 --> 40:44.208
"And you probably didn't know,

40:44.291 --> 40:49.208
"Marjorie, that Suzanne
was not just any Miss Georgia.

40:49.291 --> 40:53.750
"She was the Miss Georgia.

40:53.833 --> 40:56.875
"She didn't just twirl a baton,

40:56.958 --> 40:58.875
"that baton was on fire!

41:00.000 --> 41:04.416
"And when she threw that baton
into the air, it flew higher,

41:04.500 --> 41:08.333
"further, faster than any baton
has ever flown before,

41:08.416 --> 41:14.000
"hitting a transformer and showering
the darkened arena with sparks.

41:15.541 --> 41:20.875
"And when it finally
did come down, Marjorie,

41:21.791 --> 41:25.791
"my sister caught that baton

41:25.875 --> 41:29.916
"as 12,000 people jumped to their feet

41:30.000 --> 41:34.250
"for 16 and one-half minutes
of uninterrupted, thunderous ovation

41:34.333 --> 41:38.750
"as flames illuminated
her tear-stained face.

41:38.833 --> 41:40.750
-"And that..."

41:41.875 --> 41:45.583
"Marjorie, just so you will know

41:45.666 --> 41:49.375
"and your children will someday know,

41:49.458 --> 41:53.541
"is the night the lights
went out in Georgia!"

41:57.750 --> 41:59.083
And scene.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.625
Sorry, my Southern accent
was a little wobbly. Weird.

42:05.500 --> 42:06.708
Was that Edward Albee?

42:06.958 --> 42:09.041
Close. Designing Women.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.583
Nate, are you local?

42:15.083 --> 42:17.916
Are you already spending the night
in New York? I mean...

42:18.375 --> 42:19.625
Um...

42:19.708 --> 42:21.791
Look, can you be back tomorrow?

42:23.083 --> 42:24.583
I think the director should meet you.

42:27.416 --> 42:30.125
Can you run out
and give his mother the info?

42:30.208 --> 42:31.375
You can just tell me.

42:31.791 --> 42:35.958
Mom's probably wandering the halls,
or something, looking for celebrities.

42:36.041 --> 42:38.250
-You can remember all the details?
-Of course.

42:39.041 --> 42:40.625
I have a pornographic memory.

42:43.875 --> 42:49.291
Tomorrow at the New Amsterdam Theatre
on West 41st Street.

42:49.375 --> 42:52.833
Come to the stage door
at30 a.m. sharp, okay?

42:53.208 --> 42:55.000
That's where The Lion King opened.

42:55.916 --> 42:57.416
Is that a question?

42:57.500 --> 42:58.500
No.

42:59.375 --> 43:02.625
Sorry, do you mind
if I exit out the window?

43:03.541 --> 43:06.583
The West Side Story balcony scene
is on my bucket list.

43:06.666 --> 43:09.500
We're on the fourth floor
and there's no fire escape.

43:09.583 --> 43:11.916
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

43:15.791 --> 43:16.833
Mom!

43:16.916 --> 43:18.500
Send in the next kid.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.208
-Where are you, Mom?

43:29.208 --> 43:31.125
Yes, yes, yes!

43:39.625 --> 43:40.625
Libby.

43:42.708 --> 43:46.583
"You'll never believe..."

43:48.916 --> 43:50.125
I don't believe this.

44:10.833 --> 44:12.208
Hmm...

44:14.000 --> 44:15.333
Next in line!

44:20.500 --> 44:23.500
Would you like to make a donation
to help children with leukemia?

44:23.583 --> 44:26.291
No, thank you. Would you
like to make a donation to children

44:26.375 --> 44:29.458
who don't have a place to sleep tonight?

44:29.541 --> 44:30.583
You're short.

44:30.708 --> 44:34.208
-Excuse me?
-You're a dollar short.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.458
Look, I really need to buy
a phone charger.

44:44.791 --> 44:46.375
Next in line!

44:50.250 --> 44:54.083
I'm not the praying kind
but I'm gonna pray for you, ma'am.

45:59.708 --> 46:01.875
On Broadway

46:04.500 --> 46:08.916
They say there's always magic in the air

46:12.500 --> 46:15.291
But when you're walking down that street

46:16.041 --> 46:19.208
And you ain't had enough to eat

46:20.333 --> 46:25.166
One thin dime won't even shine your shoes

46:27.083 --> 46:30.083
Hey, now, keep up the good work, kid.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.916
You're sounding good.

46:46.416 --> 46:52.291
They say that I won't last too long
on Broadway

46:54.291 --> 46:59.208
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

47:00.750 --> 47:05.041
Hey! But they dead wrong
I know they are

47:05.583 --> 47:09.041
'Cause I can play this here guitar

47:09.416 --> 47:15.458
And I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway

47:16.125 --> 47:17.291
Play it, fellas!

47:30.083 --> 47:34.750
On Broadway!

47:35.375 --> 47:40.250
On Broadway!

47:43.416 --> 47:44.625
Hey!

47:58.083 --> 47:59.500
I'm happy to take requests.

47:59.583 --> 48:01.916
Do you know anything from
Fiddler on the Roof?

48:02.125 --> 48:03.333
Do I?

48:05.083 --> 48:06.500
Mazel tov!

48:10.625 --> 48:12.166
Next in line!

48:13.125 --> 48:14.208
Hello.

48:16.125 --> 48:18.333
Funds have been raised.

48:18.625 --> 48:22.083
I will be paying for this,
with quarters and dimes.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.666
I will also be purchasing this coat.

48:34.583 --> 48:36.458
-Get away from her.
-No.

48:36.708 --> 48:37.916
What did you say?

48:38.541 --> 48:40.875
O'hana means "family."

48:42.083 --> 48:46.375
-"Family" means nobody...
-Nobody gets left behind.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.833
-Hi.
-Hi!

49:08.916 --> 49:10.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

49:13.291 --> 49:16.875
-So, about what went down on the bus...

49:16.958 --> 49:18.416
What is all that noise?

49:18.500 --> 49:21.208
Where in the name of
Stephen Joshua Sondheim are you?

49:21.291 --> 49:22.916
New York City.

49:23.416 --> 49:26.708
Still. Libby, I got a final callback,

49:26.833 --> 49:29.541
for tomorrow,
and it's at the New Amsterdam Theatre.

49:29.625 --> 49:31.791
But that's only
if I don't get killed first.

49:31.875 --> 49:34.291
I called Aunt Heidi,
it went right to voicemail

49:34.375 --> 49:36.083
and I don't know where she lives,

49:36.166 --> 49:39.166
and I have no idea where
I'm going to sleep tonight.

49:39.250 --> 49:41.708
Nate, Nate, stop spinning.

49:42.208 --> 49:45.791
Your aunt's probably still at the museum
doing that bar mitzvah thing.

49:45.875 --> 49:47.708
Just find her there.

49:51.041 --> 49:52.916
Okay, see...

49:53.833 --> 49:57.833
This is why I love you.

49:59.875 --> 50:04.791
I really do. And just, look,
you've had my back from day one,

50:04.875 --> 50:08.041
and even if you don't like
being on stage, Lib,

50:08.416 --> 50:10.416
you're still a star.

50:12.333 --> 50:13.791
I still need you.

50:14.458 --> 50:18.458
And when you find the thing that you love,
I'll be cheering for you.

50:27.208 --> 50:32.291
Lib, you're being really quiet.
Are we still best friends?

50:39.916 --> 50:43.000
Excuse me, would you gentlemen
happen to know

50:43.083 --> 50:45.500
how to get to the Natural History Museum?

50:46.833 --> 50:50.583
-The dinosaurs.
-Yeah, the cute little dinos...

51:06.416 --> 51:09.083
Welcome to the museum.
Are you here for the bar...

51:09.166 --> 51:12.541
Mitzvah. Yes, I would never miss
a museum bar mitzvah.

51:13.416 --> 51:15.500
Terrific. Name?

51:18.250 --> 51:21.166
How about this? This is going to be fun.

51:21.250 --> 51:26.458
You read out who hasn't checked in yet.
And I'll tell you which one I am.

51:27.291 --> 51:29.250
Mmm.

51:30.750 --> 51:33.250
You look a little under-dressed
for a party.

51:38.041 --> 51:39.125
Ba-ba-bup.

51:40.083 --> 51:42.458
Shall I escort you to the exit?
Or would you...

51:45.041 --> 51:47.208
Hi, I was calling to know
if you guys open today...

51:47.291 --> 51:49.625
As I said 20 minutes ago,
we are closed...

51:49.708 --> 51:52.125
Who knew 13 year-olds could eat
so much in one night?

51:52.208 --> 51:54.791
I don't even like steak tartare
and I'm 25.

51:55.375 --> 51:57.625
Oh, crap! I forgot the asparagus.

51:57.708 --> 52:00.125
-Keep it parked. I'll go get 'em.
-Okay.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.583
What a night!

52:20.666 --> 52:23.166
You never realize how much you dislike
13 year-olds

52:23.250 --> 52:25.416
till you work a party for them,
huh, Heidi?

52:25.500 --> 52:27.791
Aw, they're not all so bad.

52:27.916 --> 52:32.625
I wish, I wish I were as unjaded
as my hilariously bold nephew.

52:32.708 --> 52:35.083
Is this the kid
you were talking about in the kitchen?

52:35.166 --> 52:36.916
-Yeah.
-Way you were going on about him,

52:37.000 --> 52:41.083
-I thought he was your son.
-Ha! Yeah, I should be so lucky.

52:41.750 --> 52:46.375
No. Okay.
I spent 15 minutes with the kid today,

52:46.458 --> 52:51.875
and he is around 100 times
funnier and quicker than I am.

52:52.333 --> 52:57.041
He's if, like, Nathan Lane
and the Tasmanian Devil had a baby.

52:58.916 --> 53:00.083
You gettin' off?

53:00.166 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, I got to get the cake
out of the kitchen.

53:18.083 --> 53:22.208
Um, pardon me. Hello.
I'm lost and I need to get to the kitchen.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.333
-Do I know you?
-Huh?

53:24.416 --> 53:25.708
What's your name?

53:25.791 --> 53:28.416
-Huh?
-I said, what's your name?

53:29.541 --> 53:31.625
It's just a lot of pressure, you know,

53:31.750 --> 53:34.041
and it's like
I'm never allowed to screw up.

53:34.125 --> 53:36.833
I'm never allowed to lose or anything.

53:36.916 --> 53:40.708
It's like I'm my parents' only hope
at a future, if that makes any sense?

53:40.916 --> 53:44.125
-Yeah, that's cool. Should we kiss, or?

53:46.541 --> 53:49.041
Anthony, my stepsister
just sent me this TikTok...

53:49.125 --> 53:52.708
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
Don't need to see memes right now.

53:52.791 --> 53:55.000
Look, this is in New York.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.041
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say

54:02.875 --> 54:04.708
Oh, my gosh!

54:04.791 --> 54:07.416
But they're dead wrong
I know they are

54:20.833 --> 54:22.791
Are we cousins?

54:23.583 --> 54:24.750
Sure!

54:31.416 --> 54:35.583
Okay, kids! We're about to do
the candle-lighting ceremony.

54:37.333 --> 54:38.541
L'chaim?

54:45.416 --> 54:47.000
Well, well, well.

54:47.166 --> 54:50.458
Do you want to tell me why
my idiot little brother

54:50.541 --> 54:51.916
is in New York City,

54:52.000 --> 54:53.833
going viral on TikTok?

54:54.125 --> 54:55.166
Well?

54:55.708 --> 54:59.541
Do I want to tell you,
or do I have to tell you?

54:59.708 --> 55:00.916
Libby.

55:07.416 --> 55:11.000
Why is my aunt calling you?

55:11.083 --> 55:14.500
She thinks I'm your mom.
It's kind of a long story.

55:19.708 --> 55:23.291
Get out your umbrellas. We're expecting
spring showers all day tomorrow

55:23.375 --> 55:24.750
in Northern West Virginia.

55:24.833 --> 55:29.041
Of course. It figures.
Rain on our last day of vacation.

55:30.083 --> 55:33.416
Anthony isn't responding to any
of my texts about the meet.

55:34.916 --> 55:36.958
Do you think the boys miss us?

55:37.041 --> 55:40.666
"Us?" Greatest parents in the world.
Come on.

55:41.958 --> 55:45.583
I just don't want Nate and Anthony
to grow apart like me and Heidi.

55:45.666 --> 55:48.750
You know, I still regret not going to
her opening night thing.

55:50.291 --> 55:53.208
Well, have you thought about
calling her lately, babe?

55:53.291 --> 55:55.041
I don't even know if she'd pick up.

55:55.583 --> 55:58.833
And the crazy thing is,
I'm kind of jealous of her.

55:58.916 --> 56:01.208
You? Come on. Really?

56:01.291 --> 56:03.791
She had a dream. I never had a dream.

56:03.875 --> 56:05.041
This isn't your dream?

56:06.375 --> 56:07.458
Babe.

56:09.500 --> 56:13.416
A kid from Pennsylvania wowed
a crowd tonight in Times Square.

56:13.500 --> 56:16.125
You think I should call her?

56:16.916 --> 56:18.541
Be the bigger person?

56:18.625 --> 56:19.708
Probably.

56:20.166 --> 56:22.750
And believe me,
you don't want to miss this kid.

56:22.833 --> 56:23.875
Watch this video...

56:24.750 --> 56:28.666
But right now,
we should celebrate our anniversary.

56:29.375 --> 56:31.375
Tricep.

56:35.083 --> 56:38.291
You made me drop the cake, okay?
That pays the rent.

56:39.416 --> 56:40.833
I'm not talking to you.

56:40.916 --> 56:42.916
Oh, okay, sorry.

56:43.166 --> 56:47.375
Yeah, I am putting you
on the first bus out because, you know,

56:47.458 --> 56:49.375
it's the right thing to do.

56:49.458 --> 56:50.666
That's all.

56:52.750 --> 56:55.750
Lilo & Stitch will still be running
in a year, okay?

56:55.833 --> 56:59.833
If your mom decides you can audition,
then you can audition.

57:20.375 --> 57:21.875
What's this?

57:21.958 --> 57:23.583
Your last five birthday cards.

57:25.666 --> 57:27.666
You remembered my birthday?

57:27.750 --> 57:29.375
Yeah, every year.

57:31.416 --> 57:33.791
I didn't know
if you'd want to hear from me.

57:34.791 --> 57:40.208
But, no matter what, we're family. So...

57:43.833 --> 57:47.250
But you yelled at me
in front of all those bar mitzvah kids,

57:47.333 --> 57:50.125
and made me feel like
I was back in middle school.

57:52.333 --> 57:57.416
I'm the only boy in seventh grade who
knows every lyric to Corner of the Sky.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.500
There's no justice.

58:01.291 --> 58:05.708
Well, "Everything has its season,
everything has its time..."

58:07.125 --> 58:13.041
I guarantee you are not the only boy
who knows every lyric to Pippin.

58:14.083 --> 58:17.083
Some just aren't comfortable yet
letting everyone know it.

58:21.041 --> 58:23.708
You're not going to cry, are you?

58:24.041 --> 58:25.541
No, no.

58:26.250 --> 58:31.000
I just... You know, you just...
You remind me of, like, me.

58:31.333 --> 58:32.458
Really?

58:32.541 --> 58:35.416
That's a compliment?
You think that's a compliment?

58:35.541 --> 58:36.583
That's amazing.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.208
Of course, it's a compliment.

58:38.291 --> 58:41.000
You're literally all I want to be
when I grow up.

58:41.083 --> 58:44.791
Three weeks on Broadway,
an apartment in New York.

58:44.916 --> 58:46.083
Queens, but...

58:46.166 --> 58:48.375
Queens is still New York.

58:48.500 --> 58:50.416
And you're still my hero.

58:56.375 --> 58:57.875
Aw...

59:04.583 --> 59:07.500
You know what?
You're going to that callback tomorrow.

59:08.125 --> 59:10.375
I mean, your mom knows you're here, right?

59:10.541 --> 59:12.458
-Are you being serious?
-Yes.

59:12.541 --> 59:15.833
But you have to stop shouting
'cause you have to save your voice.

59:15.916 --> 59:17.875
Do you have any audition tips?

59:21.333 --> 59:25.125
Okay, yeah, you know,
so I'm not the best singer,

59:25.291 --> 59:29.041
but there was this trick I used to use
for musicals, okay?

59:29.625 --> 59:32.875
You hold the sheet music, right?
Like, you know,

59:32.958 --> 59:35.250
you haven't really
fully memorized the song.

59:35.375 --> 59:40.333
And then halfway through, just casually,
let it drop to the floor like,

59:40.541 --> 59:43.500
"Wait! Not only do I know this song,

59:43.583 --> 59:46.250
"I'm going to blow you away
in the final verse."

59:46.958 --> 59:49.041
It's surprisingly effective.

59:50.083 --> 59:51.666
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

59:52.541 --> 59:55.416
And find your light.

59:55.875 --> 59:58.041
Everybody forgets that.

59:58.250 --> 1:00:01.958
But how are they gonna remember you
if they can't see you?

1:00:03.625 --> 1:00:04.708
Yeah.

1:00:05.125 --> 1:00:07.625
Yeah. Find your light.

1:00:07.708 --> 1:00:08.833
Okay.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:17.666
I looked up to her, you know?
Your mom. I really did.

1:00:19.875 --> 1:00:21.583
She got the one thing

1:00:24.125 --> 1:00:25.541
I couldn't get.

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:29.333
An amazing kid.

1:00:40.791 --> 1:00:41.958
I love you!

1:01:05.166 --> 1:01:09.166
Well, the callback was a disaster
and you blew it big time, kid.

1:01:09.250 --> 1:01:11.291
Back to Pittsburgh for you!

1:01:11.375 --> 1:01:13.083
Can I borrow some money for the bus?

1:01:13.166 --> 1:01:15.791
Try hitchhiking.
It'll build your character.

1:01:21.333 --> 1:01:22.500
Nate!

1:01:25.750 --> 1:01:27.458
-Nathan!
-Crap!

1:01:29.541 --> 1:01:32.041
- Where is he?
- Gotta pee! Gotta pee!

1:01:32.125 --> 1:01:33.166
Around the corner.

1:01:33.291 --> 1:01:34.791
How are you here right now?

1:01:36.583 --> 1:01:37.583
Hi, Anthony.

1:01:38.458 --> 1:01:40.666
Like a giant. He's like a giant.

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:43.666
Hi, Aunt Heidi.
Long time no everything, I guess.

1:01:43.750 --> 1:01:45.916
Don't "Hi, Anthony" me, Nate.

1:01:46.791 --> 1:01:48.625
Okay. Bye, Anthony.

1:01:48.708 --> 1:01:51.041
And I can live
with Heidi in New York. Perfect.

1:01:51.125 --> 1:01:53.250
Yeah, like Mom would ever let that happen.

1:01:53.333 --> 1:01:56.583
So, what, then? Are they
waiting downstairs for me with handcuffs?

1:01:56.666 --> 1:01:59.583
They don't even know we're here.
Get in my truck right now.

1:01:59.666 --> 1:02:01.833
-What? What?
-You didn't tell on me?

1:02:01.916 --> 1:02:04.875
No. I'm the one who's supposed to be
watching you, remember?

1:02:04.958 --> 1:02:06.791
Get downstairs right now!

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:12.166
Okay. Please, just let me stay for two
more hours, so I can go to my callback.

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:19.875
I know I embarrass you, Anthony.

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:21.791
Every day.

1:02:22.541 --> 1:02:26.166
And I know that you hate being my brother,

1:02:26.250 --> 1:02:30.458
just please, let me have this one thing.

1:02:34.208 --> 1:02:38.208
I've been trying to explain how big
a Broadway callback is for seven hours,

1:02:38.291 --> 1:02:40.375
so, good luck.

1:02:41.083 --> 1:02:44.416
But, just for the record,
you may have run away,

1:02:44.541 --> 1:02:47.500
but Anthony apparently
threw quite a party.

1:02:47.583 --> 1:02:49.875
Which I'm sure your parents
wouldn't be happy about.

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:51.708
So, you have some leverage here.

1:02:51.791 --> 1:02:54.500
Ooh, you're good.
You should be an agent someday.

1:02:54.583 --> 1:02:55.833
Want to be my agent?

1:02:56.791 --> 1:02:58.500
Is that a real job?

1:02:58.625 --> 1:03:01.250
That's the best job, okay?

1:03:01.333 --> 1:03:03.750
You collect ten percent
of an actor's salary

1:03:03.958 --> 1:03:06.791
by making phone calls
and going to three lunches a day.

1:03:06.875 --> 1:03:09.958
And you don't have to humiliate yourself
in an audition.

1:03:10.666 --> 1:03:13.583
And you get to see
what makes people amazing

1:03:13.666 --> 1:03:15.833
before they even know about it themselves.

1:03:16.750 --> 1:03:18.208
That's what an agent does, too.

1:03:18.291 --> 1:03:19.958
Good lord! I'm gonna wring you...

1:03:20.041 --> 1:03:21.166
Why are you limping?

1:03:21.291 --> 1:03:22.833
Quit changing the subject.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.583
Let me just say
that for your little brother

1:03:25.666 --> 1:03:28.541
to have even gotten a callback
is kind of remarkable.

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:32.416
And it says big things
about Nate's talent, Anthony.

1:03:32.541 --> 1:03:35.791
It just... It's two hours, two hours.

1:03:38.416 --> 1:03:39.958
Oh, no!

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:41.333
My favorite vase.

1:03:41.416 --> 1:03:42.458
Nate!

1:03:48.458 --> 1:03:49.666
Oh, no!

1:03:53.666 --> 1:03:56.416
Natey! Stop!

1:03:58.291 --> 1:04:00.125
He's always wanted to escape out a window.

1:04:03.041 --> 1:04:04.916
Gosh, he is a great client.

1:04:14.166 --> 1:04:15.625
When I catch this punk...

1:04:29.375 --> 1:04:31.750
I know you not about to hop over
that turnstile.

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:36.333
Thank goodness! A subway person.
I'm experiencing an emergency.

1:04:36.666 --> 1:04:38.916
"An emergency?" Really?

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.041
I need to get to Manhattan.
It's a matter of life, death, and dreams.

1:04:44.125 --> 1:04:48.625
Hold up. Wait a minute. Are you...
Yo, Keith, come here!

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:50.000
Quick!

1:04:50.083 --> 1:04:52.791
Don't he look like that kid
that went viral on TikTok?

1:04:52.875 --> 1:04:54.041
I did?

1:04:55.166 --> 1:04:57.500
Yes! That's me! I'm the kid!

1:04:59.791 --> 1:05:01.625
Can I get a selfie for my niece?

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:03.708
Can I get a free ride on the subway?

1:05:09.291 --> 1:05:10.750
Let's go! Let's go!

1:05:11.625 --> 1:05:13.625
Ooh, he took my trench coat.

1:05:15.041 --> 1:05:17.708
-Oh. Yeah. Where is my...
-Keys?

1:05:17.833 --> 1:05:22.666
Yeah. Okay. So, we're going to
just find him at the audition studio,

1:05:22.750 --> 1:05:25.041
and it's going to be okay.

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:27.208
-Okay. Yeah.
-Let's go.

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:30.541
When this is over, I want to know
how much you pay for this place.

1:05:30.625 --> 1:05:32.166
Okay. You'd be surprised.

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:36.750
Excuse me,
do you know the stop for Broadway?

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.208
Which Broadway?
There is a lot of Broadways.

1:05:40.291 --> 1:05:43.291
You know, like, the Broadway.

1:05:43.416 --> 1:05:46.458
They say the neon lights
Are bright on Broadway

1:05:46.958 --> 1:05:48.375
That's the TikTok kid!

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.916
As long as he's alive,
everything will be okay.

1:06:01.083 --> 1:06:02.625
So I can kill him.

1:06:02.750 --> 1:06:04.166
Over his agent's dead body.

1:06:04.291 --> 1:06:06.416
All right, nobody's murdering anyone!

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.541
You started it.

1:06:07.625 --> 1:06:10.166
All right, be respectful.
This is an audition place.

1:06:39.666 --> 1:06:40.708
Okay.

1:06:41.250 --> 1:06:44.041
Lilo & Stitch. It was a cartoon.

1:06:44.875 --> 1:06:47.208
Can you just please
check the schedule again?

1:06:47.291 --> 1:06:48.875
There's no way he made this up.

1:06:48.958 --> 1:06:50.750
A hundred percent kidnapped.

1:06:50.833 --> 1:06:52.166
Don't... Stop saying that!

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:56.083
There's no Lilo & Stitch
on the schedule today. Promise.

1:06:56.166 --> 1:06:58.875
You haven't seen anyone this morning
who looks like me?

1:06:58.958 --> 1:07:01.666
Just like, little shorter, kind of gawky?

1:07:01.750 --> 1:07:06.333
He's not gawky, he is incredibly castable
and very cuddly.

1:07:06.416 --> 1:07:08.291
No matter who he chooses to love.

1:07:08.416 --> 1:07:10.166
Okay, okay. Yeah.

1:07:10.583 --> 1:07:11.916
Anyway...

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.625
-Ma'am!
-I just want...

1:07:14.833 --> 1:07:19.333
Wait, "Ma'am?" "Ma'am?" I'm ma'am to you?
We could have gone to college together.

1:07:19.416 --> 1:07:21.875
-Hold on.
-My... Okay.

1:07:22.458 --> 1:07:25.333
You knew the callback wasn't here,
didn't you?

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:27.333
-Aunt Heidi.
-What?

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:29.833
He's at some place called
the Amsterdam Theatre.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:33.666
New Amsterdam, Anthony. "New."
Words matter.

1:07:45.625 --> 1:07:48.250
-You!
-Me. Hello.

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:52.208
This is the Lilo & Stitch
final callback, right?

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:53.916
I hope so.

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000
Then why did you come dressed
as Éponine from Les Miz?

1:07:59.958 --> 1:08:01.416
Good luck!

1:08:03.958 --> 1:08:06.875
Okay. Let's cast a musical.

1:08:10.708 --> 1:08:12.041
Not much time.

1:08:12.250 --> 1:08:13.583
Right up the stairs.

1:08:13.750 --> 1:08:15.958
Hello, twins. How are you?

1:08:16.208 --> 1:08:19.250
Keep it moving. Up, up, up, up.

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:21.083
Thank you. Thank you.

1:08:21.208 --> 1:08:23.583
Don't worry, I'm losing the coat.

1:08:24.291 --> 1:08:25.416
Go!

1:08:30.833 --> 1:08:32.583
Come on.

1:08:33.708 --> 1:08:36.208
I feel like Elisabeth Shue in
Adventures in Babysitting

1:08:36.291 --> 1:08:39.000
when the kid she's watching
gets stabbed in the foot.

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:42.958
What... Okay, I'm 100.
Hi, I'm 100 years old.

1:08:43.250 --> 1:08:44.250
Heidi?

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:48.041
Oh, my gosh! Don't look at me. I'm a mess.

1:08:48.125 --> 1:08:49.875
You disappeared yesterday.

1:08:49.958 --> 1:08:52.416
-I hate when good people disappear.

1:08:52.916 --> 1:08:55.875
A Solitary Woman is a major play, Heidi.

1:08:55.958 --> 1:08:58.375
-Yeah.
-It's been a bear to cast.

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:00.500
I'm sorry. Family emergency.

1:09:01.083 --> 1:09:03.250
Look, I just got a last minute no-show

1:09:03.666 --> 1:09:08.166
and the director hasn't liked
anybody this week. Can I slot you in?

1:09:08.250 --> 1:09:11.208
Is this an out-of-town job,
or straight to Broadway?

1:09:11.291 --> 1:09:15.375
All right, that's
a really good question, actually.

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:17.583
Straight to Broadway, baby.

1:09:17.666 --> 1:09:20.791
-You're doing this audition.
-Meet us at the Amsterdam Theatre!

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:25.458
Anthony, it's not a famously liberal city
in Europe. It's a Broadway theater.

1:09:29.416 --> 1:09:32.250
-Okay, thanks. No, yeah.
-Thank you.

1:09:33.083 --> 1:09:34.291
Okay.

1:09:40.416 --> 1:09:41.416
Thank you.

1:09:42.041 --> 1:09:43.250
Thank you.

1:09:45.750 --> 1:09:48.916
She's not available.
We'll check on her availability.

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:51.833
Okay, whenever you're ready, Nate.

1:09:52.958 --> 1:09:55.958
Okay. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:14.208
I barely had any time to memorize
these sides, so...

1:10:14.291 --> 1:10:16.583
That's not important. Just do your best.

1:10:16.833 --> 1:10:19.500
Start with Stitch's entrance
in the first scene.

1:10:23.416 --> 1:10:25.208
"How do you plead?"

1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:28.583
"Not guilty!
My experiments are only theoretical

1:10:28.666 --> 1:10:31.500
"and completely within legal boundaries."

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:35.666
Nate, if you actually want to start over,
and just read Stitch's line...

1:10:35.750 --> 1:10:37.708
No worries, I got this!

1:10:37.791 --> 1:10:41.083
"We believe you actually
created something."

1:10:41.208 --> 1:10:46.666
"Created something? But that would be
irresponsible and unethical."

1:10:47.083 --> 1:10:49.750
And then it says Stitch turns around
in the glass jar.

1:10:57.208 --> 1:10:59.666
"What is that monstrosity?"

1:11:03.083 --> 1:11:04.875
-Told you.
-"'Monstrosity'?

1:11:04.958 --> 1:11:08.166
"What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

1:11:08.250 --> 1:11:09.750
"I call it Experiment 626."

1:11:09.833 --> 1:11:11.791
That's what you get from Pittsburgh.

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:15.708
And then Jumba sings the song
626 is Not Just a Number.

1:11:17.458 --> 1:11:21.875
And which is actually getting rewritten
as we sit here. Thank you.

1:11:21.958 --> 1:11:24.333
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I not have...

1:11:24.750 --> 1:11:26.666
No, no, you were...

1:11:28.541 --> 1:11:29.541
That was fine, Nate.

1:11:32.625 --> 1:11:36.583
Oh, hi. Were you there the whole time?

1:11:36.875 --> 1:11:38.083
The whole time.

1:11:40.750 --> 1:11:44.291
Nate, Hi. I'm the director.

1:11:44.375 --> 1:11:46.291
Have you learnt the song?

1:11:46.375 --> 1:11:50.041
I mean, with the other kids, sure.

1:11:50.125 --> 1:11:53.541
Listen, when you get to the part
in the duet where Lilo chimes in,

1:11:53.666 --> 1:11:55.375
let that music play in the background.

1:12:00.250 --> 1:12:04.541
Just sing Stitch's lyrics, I mean.
You only have to play Stitch today.

1:12:06.208 --> 1:12:08.833
Oh, my gosh! I'm such an idiot!

1:12:25.625 --> 1:12:27.250
Okay, what's so funny?

1:12:29.916 --> 1:12:32.166
How amazing is this kid?

1:12:32.250 --> 1:12:34.666
On Broadway

1:12:34.750 --> 1:12:36.041
Play it, fellas!

1:12:38.416 --> 1:12:39.416
Yeah.

1:12:50.041 --> 1:12:53.416
On Broadway!

1:12:53.958 --> 1:12:59.416
On Broadway!

1:13:01.250 --> 1:13:02.541
Let's go! Let's go!

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:11.750
Okay, whenever you're ready, Nate.

1:13:13.875 --> 1:13:17.833
You know you're the only kid here who
didn't show up with a parent today, right?

1:13:19.416 --> 1:13:20.916
Good luck!

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.208
Hello?

1:13:24.375 --> 1:13:25.500
Nate?

1:13:37.250 --> 1:13:40.166
Okay. Do you have any questions
before you sing?

1:13:41.625 --> 1:13:42.625
Just one.

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:48.375
In the movie,
Stitch can't really speak sentences,

1:13:48.666 --> 1:13:51.166
so, how does he sing lyrics
in the musical?

1:13:54.208 --> 1:13:55.750
Because, you know,

1:13:55.833 --> 1:13:59.333
musicals allow us to say things
we can't actually say in real life.

1:14:30.333 --> 1:14:34.958
I'll admit
I don't know much about this life

1:14:35.083 --> 1:14:39.916
I've spent a long time
On the outside looking in

1:14:40.208 --> 1:14:45.041
Never feeling accepted
Thinking that's just the way it was

1:14:46.458 --> 1:14:50.541
But something happened
Somehow life brought you to me

1:14:50.750 --> 1:14:55.291
And I think that's when
I realized I belonged

1:14:55.375 --> 1:15:01.083
My family's been here all along
And boy, it's good to have a friend so...

1:15:02.458 --> 1:15:06.458
Maybe I don't always need to
Feel so small

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:12.916
Maybe this planet ain't so bad after all

1:15:13.666 --> 1:15:15.333
From here on out...

1:15:15.625 --> 1:15:18.916
Thanks, Nate. I think we're good.

1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:35.000
You don't embarrass me!

1:15:40.208 --> 1:15:41.333
I promise.

1:15:43.250 --> 1:15:44.833
You don't embarrass me, Nate.

1:16:04.708 --> 1:16:10.125
So from here on out
I'll never let you down

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:13.125
I won't be perfect all the time

1:16:13.208 --> 1:16:15.875
But I'm always gonna try, yeah

1:16:16.125 --> 1:16:20.208
I don't care where
I'll always be right there

1:16:20.375 --> 1:16:23.250
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1:16:23.333 --> 1:16:27.833
And family means no one gets left behind

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:35.541
You bet I'll try
To bring you all the sunny days

1:16:35.666 --> 1:16:39.791
And if you cry
I'll be there all the same

1:16:39.875 --> 1:16:42.416
So bring the thunder, bring the rain

1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:45.166
'Cause you know

1:16:45.333 --> 1:16:49.416
From here on out
I'll never let you down

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:52.125
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1:16:52.541 --> 1:16:56.791
And family means no one gets left behind

1:16:57.208 --> 1:16:59.250
Yeah, oh

1:16:59.416 --> 1:17:02.458
Left behind, yeah

1:17:02.541 --> 1:17:04.375
Oh!

1:17:04.458 --> 1:17:08.166
From here on out
I'll never let you down

1:17:08.625 --> 1:17:10.958
Can't claim I'll do everything right

1:17:11.041 --> 1:17:12.041
Find your light.

1:17:12.125 --> 1:17:13.625
But I'll love you all my life

1:17:13.708 --> 1:17:18.166
Yeah, I don't care where
I'll always be right there

1:17:18.250 --> 1:17:21.041
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1:17:21.291 --> 1:17:25.833
And family means no one gets left behind

1:17:26.041 --> 1:17:28.083
Yeah, oh

1:17:28.166 --> 1:17:30.625
Left behind

1:17:31.166 --> 1:17:35.083
'Cause family means
No one gets left behind

1:17:35.666 --> 1:17:36.750
Yeah

1:17:37.750 --> 1:17:41.375
Left behind, yeah

1:17:44.625 --> 1:17:47.625
'Cause I've got a family to call mine

1:17:48.916 --> 1:17:54.000
And family means no one gets left behind

1:17:57.708 --> 1:18:00.500
-You don't do that, it's inappropriate.

1:18:06.250 --> 1:18:09.083
Okay, Nate,
I think that's all we're gonna need.

1:18:17.958 --> 1:18:19.083
Good luck!

1:18:19.166 --> 1:18:22.041
- Good job!
- He was really good!

1:18:24.541 --> 1:18:25.750
Hi.

1:18:31.208 --> 1:18:34.875
I didn't know you could,
like, do all that.

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.083
You don't let me sing in the house.

1:18:37.416 --> 1:18:40.416
Wow, your comebacks have gotten
sharper in New York.

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:42.333
-Really?
-What? They have.

1:18:42.416 --> 1:18:44.750
I dropped the sheet music
like you told me to.

1:18:45.375 --> 1:18:46.583
I saw.

1:18:46.708 --> 1:18:50.083
Yeah, I actually had...
I had just left my own audition,

1:18:50.166 --> 1:18:51.333
and let me just say,

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:53.291
-you should be giving me tips.

1:18:53.375 --> 1:18:55.416
My mom just sent me
an all-caps text saying,

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.458
"Why aren't you at your dad's?
I'm worried."

1:18:57.541 --> 1:19:00.041
Perfect timing. I'm double parked.
Let's go.

1:19:00.416 --> 1:19:02.125
Oh, Nate. Here.

1:19:03.958 --> 1:19:05.375
It's a gift.

1:19:05.458 --> 1:19:08.250
I picked it up on my way at some like,

1:19:08.333 --> 1:19:11.291
dumb tourist trap in Times Square. So...

1:19:11.375 --> 1:19:13.833
Anthony, someone's putting
a ticket on your truck.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.791
Go now. You go now.

1:19:16.291 --> 1:19:17.916
My bad, officer!

1:19:18.958 --> 1:19:21.541
I got you a gift, too.

1:19:21.833 --> 1:19:23.291
I hope it's your size.

1:19:23.875 --> 1:19:26.333
Great. Oh, I'm gonna miss this.

1:19:28.541 --> 1:19:29.541
Well...

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:32.875
You should go, Natey.

1:19:35.416 --> 1:19:37.416
I hope I don't see you
at Christmas this year.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:39.000
Jeez, Nate. That was harsh.

1:19:39.083 --> 1:19:42.916
Because I hope you get the part in
the play and you're too busy to come home.

1:19:43.541 --> 1:19:45.916
I skipped out on that audition, sweetie.

1:19:47.291 --> 1:19:52.000
I just wanted to be here with you.
And I'm so glad that I was.

1:19:52.625 --> 1:19:54.125
Not to alarm anyone,

1:19:54.208 --> 1:19:56.750
but your mom is on the phone
with your brother now,

1:19:56.833 --> 1:19:58.500
and they are leaving the resort,

1:19:58.583 --> 1:20:02.166
and Anthony said a lot of words that
I can't really say in front of an adult,

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:05.750
but I believe he'd bleeping like you
to get in the bleeping truck, now.

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:09.666
So, basically, if you two are
going to cry, cry bleeping quick.

1:20:13.541 --> 1:20:15.541
Thanks for the audition tips.

1:20:18.500 --> 1:20:20.916
Nate, can you just tell your mom...

1:20:23.875 --> 1:20:28.333
I don't even remember why we're fighting
and I miss her.

1:20:30.125 --> 1:20:32.416
Okay. Okay, I will.

1:20:33.083 --> 1:20:34.291
And I'm sorry.

1:20:39.916 --> 1:20:41.625
I really meant it last night.

1:20:45.166 --> 1:20:46.458
You're my hero.

1:20:51.291 --> 1:20:52.375
Cool.

1:21:01.208 --> 1:21:04.041
-I call DJ.
-No show tunes or I drive off the highway.

1:21:04.125 --> 1:21:06.916
You really have
learned nothing today, have you?

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.583
Uh, baby steps.

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:25.000
I love you.

1:21:39.333 --> 1:21:41.333
Well, I'm very proud of the boys.

1:21:41.833 --> 1:21:43.000
What happened?

1:21:43.083 --> 1:21:46.500
Anthony said Nate couldn't come
to the phone because,

1:21:46.791 --> 1:21:48.916
you're not going to believe this,

1:21:49.041 --> 1:21:50.750
Nate is teaching him how to sing.

1:21:51.750 --> 1:21:54.375
-That's kinda nice. Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:21:54.458 --> 1:21:57.875
As long as it's not Wicked.
I can't. I really can't.

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:03.708
So if you care to find me

1:22:03.916 --> 1:22:06.666
Look to the western sky!

1:22:06.958 --> 1:22:09.500
As someone told me lately

1:22:09.791 --> 1:22:14.000
Everyone deserves the chance to fly!

1:22:24.208 --> 1:22:25.833
Thanks for making me run away.

1:22:25.916 --> 1:22:27.000
Seriously.

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:32.916
It was, you know, very agent-like of you.

1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:37.333
I think I found my thing.

1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:49.583
-Love you like a sister!
-Love you like a sister, too!

1:22:49.875 --> 1:22:51.416
Later, Libby.

1:23:13.541 --> 1:23:17.083
Hey, Lib. It's been a week and no news.

1:23:17.250 --> 1:23:19.958
Why aren't you in study hall?
I'm spiraling.

1:23:20.916 --> 1:23:22.333
Okay, love you, bye.

1:23:28.541 --> 1:23:30.208
Loser.

1:23:30.291 --> 1:23:34.125
I've gotta be where my spirit can run free

1:23:34.458 --> 1:23:39.083
Gotta find my corner of the sky

1:23:47.041 --> 1:23:50.291
-If you tell anyone...

1:23:50.458 --> 1:23:53.125
Nate Foster
to the principal's office.

1:23:53.208 --> 1:23:55.750
Nate Foster to the principal's office.

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.666
Your secret is safe with me.

1:24:08.125 --> 1:24:09.791
Nate Foster to the principal's office.

1:24:09.875 --> 1:24:11.583
Whatever I did, I didn't do it.

1:24:15.291 --> 1:24:16.500
What's going on?

1:24:18.166 --> 1:24:22.708
Nate, did you take a trip to New York
without telling us?

1:24:23.125 --> 1:24:25.583
The subway lady said
I could hop over the turnstile.

1:24:25.666 --> 1:24:27.416
No, Nate. It's not that.

1:24:28.416 --> 1:24:32.333
Anthony shouldn't get in trouble.
He actually kind of saved me.

1:24:32.416 --> 1:24:33.541
Nate.

1:24:33.833 --> 1:24:38.208
And Libby shouldn't be grounded.
If anyone should, it's me.

1:24:38.875 --> 1:24:41.458
I'm not. And you're not.

1:24:41.541 --> 1:24:43.541
Natey, honey. We got a call.

1:24:45.250 --> 1:24:48.083
The initial offer is low but workable.

1:24:51.375 --> 1:24:53.833
Wait. Wait.

1:24:57.500 --> 1:24:58.666
-You mean...

1:24:58.750 --> 1:25:01.208
Just getting started
We about to go up

1:25:01.583 --> 1:25:03.958
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1:25:04.375 --> 1:25:06.583
This is your moment
Own it, sister, woman up!

1:25:07.166 --> 1:25:10.125
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls

1:25:10.208 --> 1:25:12.583
We on! We on! We on!

1:25:13.125 --> 1:25:15.791
We on! We on! We on!

1:25:15.875 --> 1:25:18.083
We on! We on! We on!

1:25:18.208 --> 1:25:21.916
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1:25:23.416 --> 1:25:24.500
Yeah!

1:25:25.333 --> 1:25:27.625
Before I met Libby, I had no friends.

1:25:27.708 --> 1:25:29.416
But now, I have friend.

1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:32.500
And because of her,
I will be performing the role of Stitch

1:25:32.625 --> 1:25:34.250
at two matinees per week,

1:25:34.333 --> 1:25:36.583
and sometimes more often
if the star is sick.

1:25:36.708 --> 1:25:38.833
I'm about to go awf

1:25:40.458 --> 1:25:43.208
We started from the bottom
Now we're rising to the top

1:25:43.416 --> 1:25:45.833
And now you've got her going
And she's never gonna stop!

1:25:45.958 --> 1:25:48.708
It pays to have a beastie
That goes this hard!

1:25:48.791 --> 1:25:50.708
If you want receipts
Here's my business card!

1:25:50.833 --> 1:25:53.083
Dear pearls

1:25:53.166 --> 1:25:55.500
Get out of your shells
It's your world

1:25:55.583 --> 1:26:00.000
We've got to cheer each other on!

1:26:00.083 --> 1:26:02.458
Until Queendom come!

1:26:03.375 --> 1:26:06.083
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:06.208 --> 1:26:08.583
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:08.916 --> 1:26:10.833
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:11.083 --> 1:26:13.833
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf...

1:26:13.916 --> 1:26:16.000
Before Nate came back into my life,

1:26:16.083 --> 1:26:20.333
I was a cater waiter with
a rent-controlled apartment, but now...

1:26:21.541 --> 1:26:23.791
I'm A Solitary Woman,

1:26:24.041 --> 1:26:25.750
with a rent-controlled apartment.

1:26:25.833 --> 1:26:30.000
And an amazing family. And agent.

1:26:30.750 --> 1:26:33.416
Just getting started
We about to go up

1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:36.500
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1:26:36.583 --> 1:26:38.791
This is your moment
Own it, sister, woman up!

1:26:38.875 --> 1:26:42.125
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls

1:26:42.208 --> 1:26:45.041
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:45.125 --> 1:26:47.833
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000
We on! We on! We on!

1:26:50.125 --> 1:26:54.000
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1:26:55.291 --> 1:26:56.333
Yep!

1:26:57.416 --> 1:26:59.916
I'm about to go awf

1:27:00.041 --> 1:27:01.791
-Yep!

1:27:03.583 --> 1:27:06.291
For the longest time,
I always thought of Libby

1:27:06.416 --> 1:27:10.250
as my little brother's
loud, intelligent friend.

1:27:10.333 --> 1:27:14.166
But now, I pledge that
if I ever decide to go pro one day,

1:27:14.250 --> 1:27:17.458
I will hire Libby as my sports agent.

1:27:18.166 --> 1:27:19.166
Is that good?

1:27:19.250 --> 1:27:22.708
Let's just say there's a reason
Nate's the actor of the family.

1:27:22.833 --> 1:27:24.166
Could I try another take?

1:27:24.375 --> 1:27:26.208
Hold on, you need lip gloss.

1:27:26.416 --> 1:27:27.916
-I'm a star maker
-Yeah

1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:29.250
A mover and shaker

1:27:29.333 --> 1:27:31.791
-Only thirteen
-But bringing home the vegan bacon

1:27:31.875 --> 1:27:34.791
The hustle's a la carte,
And I don't sell dreams

1:27:34.875 --> 1:27:37.416
But if I'm representing,
It'll be a small fee

1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:39.083
Dear pearls

1:27:39.208 --> 1:27:41.541
Get out of your shells
It's your world

1:27:41.625 --> 1:27:43.333
We've got to cheer each other on!

1:27:43.416 --> 1:27:44.458
I love you!

1:27:46.458 --> 1:27:48.416
Until Queendom come!

1:27:49.125 --> 1:27:51.375
Just getting started
We about to go up

1:27:51.791 --> 1:27:53.416
That's my brother!

1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:57.083
Just getting started
We about to go up

1:27:57.291 --> 1:28:00.000
Just getting started
We about to go up!

1:28:00.541 --> 1:28:03.125
We on! We on! We on!

1:28:03.250 --> 1:28:05.416
We on! We on! We on!

1:28:06.125 --> 1:28:08.250
We on! We on! We on!

1:28:08.333 --> 1:28:11.583
But hold up just a second
I'm about to go awf

1:28:11.791 --> 1:28:13.833
I put me on
I put me on

1:28:13.916 --> 1:28:17.375
I put me, put me, put me, put me
I'm about to go awf

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:19.500
I put me on
I put me on

1:28:19.583 --> 1:28:22.333
I put me, I put me, I put me, I put me
I'm about to go

1:28:22.416 --> 1:28:25.208
Just getting started
We about to go up

1:28:25.291 --> 1:28:28.000
Calling all boss chicks around the world

1:28:28.083 --> 1:28:30.583
This is your moment
Own it, sister, woman up!

1:28:30.666 --> 1:28:33.875
The world is your oyster
And we are the pearls
