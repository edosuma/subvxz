WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.470
- Hey, guys.
- [both] Hey, Randy.

00:04.537 --> 00:06.300
- [Jill] Hi.
- Mom, guess what.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.431
l got picked to write
for the school paper.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.669
Great. l used to write
for my school paper.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.713
l didn't know they had printing presses
back then.

00:13.813 --> 00:15.178
They didn't.

00:15.248 --> 00:19.708
We wrote by hand and pigeons carried
the news from village to village.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.619
Randy, l got an idea
for your first story.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.815
You can write about me.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.450
You can tell
the whole Brad Taylor story in depth.

00:26.559 --> 00:28.686
And after that sentence, then what?

00:30.663 --> 00:32.426
How about you write about me?

00:32.531 --> 00:35.365
That's not even a sentence.
lt's a question mark.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.834
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.462
How are you?

00:39.539 --> 00:42.303
Guess what.
Randy is gonna be a newspaper man.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.804
All right.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.972
You're carrying on a tradition.
My brothers were newspaper men.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.573
First thing we do, get you a big bike.

00:50.650 --> 00:53.210
With those big tires.
Whitewalls or something.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.684
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.689
Fender, a little horn...
lt'll look corny, but it'll be cool.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.725
- We'll put a card in the spokes...
- Dad!

00:59.793 --> 01:02.956
Big, big bags. We'll fold the papers up,
l'll teach you how to throw.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.724
l'm not gonna deliver the paper.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.459
l'm gonna write for it.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.898
Oh.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.935
Can we still get the bike?

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.024 --> 02:06.457
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.121
Well, l got my story
for the paper.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.356
- What's it about?
- Well...

02:11.431 --> 02:15.197
lt turns out that the cafeteria lady
serves a vegetarian casserole

02:15.301 --> 02:18.464
with the same ladle she uses
to scoop the pork stew.

02:19.405 --> 02:20.736
[whistles]

02:22.142 --> 02:24.303
What are you gonna call it,
''Ladle-gate''?

02:26.746 --> 02:29.408
l'm gonna blow the lid
right off that lunchroom, Dad.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.040
l've done that.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.488
Blew the lockers
right out of the gymnasium.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.990
l blew the librarian
right out of the library.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.485
- Hi.
- [Tim] Hi there.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.029
- You free Sunday?
- All day. What's up?

02:45.098 --> 02:49.467
Well, my school is sponsoring
an all-day couples therapy workshop.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.537
l'd really like us to go.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.299
Oh!

02:54.073 --> 02:56.735
l said,
''Sunday, l'm free any day but Sunday''.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.300
Good, 'cause it's actually Saturday.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.641
Oh, l hate when you do that.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.377
l don't want to go.

03:05.451 --> 03:08.716
Look, l think this workshop
could really benefit our marriage.

03:08.788 --> 03:12.087
lt's called,
''Keeping the Magic Alive''.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.456
- What's wrong with our marriage?
- Nothing.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.690
Nothing? That sounds pretty serious.
We better go right now!

03:18.932 --> 03:21.958
Tim, you go to therapy
to prevent things from going wrong,

03:22.035 --> 03:23.969
to learn to communicate better.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.403
A good marriage needs maintenance.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.770
- Just like a car.
- Huh?

03:30.210 --> 03:34.374
You take your Mustang ­n
to Lou­e's arage every 3,000 m­les.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.449
Why just go there
'cause we get a free air filter.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.417
l really want to go to this workshop.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.017
Why don't you go alone?

03:43.122 --> 03:45.386
''Couple'' generally means two people.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.491
Maybe you'll meet somebody there.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.332
Does everybody know what time it is?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.959
<i>- Tool Time!
- Wow. That's right.</i>

03:56.069 --> 03:59.903
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.838
[cheering]

04:05.845 --> 04:07.210
Thank you.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.010
<i>Thank you everybody and Heidi.
Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:11.744
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor

04:11.818 --> 04:14.048
and you all know my assistant,
Al Borland.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.147
Today we're gonna show you how
to maintain the tools in your workshop.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.589
We're not talking about
some marriage workshop

04:20.692 --> 04:22.957
where they force you to spill your guts.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.091
Why would we?
We're a tool show.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.036
You see, over time your tools
could become useless if not maintained.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.935
And maintenance on tools is easy.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.100
You don't have to drag these bad boys
to some tool therapy group

04:36.175 --> 04:38.268
to ''bring back the magic''.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.579
Tool therapy group?

04:43.182 --> 04:44.547
You must have read the book.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.552
<i>Hammers are from Venus,
Pliers are from Mars.</i>

04:49.989 --> 04:51.752
You're the one from Mars.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.891
They found life there, you know.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.930
There was a meteorite
with old Germans in it.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.671
- Now...
- Germs.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.638
There were germs in it.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.834
Over the winter you might get a light
coat of rust on an adjustable wrench.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.938
The simplest way to take it off
is a little 80-grit sandpaper.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.846
Lightly sand and clean it right up.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.478
You can also use a file,
a wire brush or a wonderful bar.

05:21.587 --> 05:24.647
Now, Big Mike's is what l call
a wonderful bar, you know.

05:24.724 --> 05:28.558
Four of his rusty nails, you won't care
what shape your tools are in.

05:28.628 --> 05:32.394
[slurring] l love you, man.

05:32.465 --> 05:36.299
Actually, this cleaning implement
is called a ''wonderful bar''.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.304
There's another wonderful bar
called The Pig's Knuckle.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.532
Boy, that place...

05:40.606 --> 05:44.440
Use it like an eraser
to polish off the rust on your tools.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.411
That's great.
Let's move on to power tool maintenance.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.608
We'll start with this nomadic auger.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.843
- Nomadic?
- Yes.

05:54.387 --> 05:58.619
That would be the group of tools that
wanders aimlessly throughout the desert?

05:59.792 --> 06:03.159
To properly maintain your
pneumatic tools, keep them lubricated.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.730
- Right. Listen to this thing.
- [whirring]

06:05.798 --> 06:08.426
Hear that wind down like that?
lt needs oil.

06:09.001 --> 06:12.937
That's right. Rule of thumb:
Two drops of oil per full day of use.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.870
Of course, that is just a guideline.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.808
Well, you don't
want to use too much oil, Tim.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.175
Relax, Al. Binford's paying for it.

06:21.314 --> 06:26.752
Well, you also want to keep your
pneumatic sanders, drills and nail guns

06:26.819 --> 06:28.582
properly oiled.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.417
OK, plenty of oil in this bad boy.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.991
We'll see if we fixed that.
A little air pressure.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.027
All right. See how it sounds, Al.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.755
[whirring]

06:46.606 --> 06:50.667
Well, now that we've given Al
a lube job,

06:50.743 --> 06:53.576
tune in next time
when we rotate that spare tire.

07:02.555 --> 07:05.183
Well, boss, what did you think
of the show?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.226
<i>- Show?
- Tool Time.</i>

07:07.326 --> 07:09.692
Binford, the company you own,
sponsors it.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.356
Oh, l'm sorry, Tim.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.023
l'm just preoccupied.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.035
My marriage broke up.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.062
- No way.
- Yeah.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.370
Wow. Sorry to hear that.
l didn't know you were having trouble.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.604
We just stopped talking to each other.

07:25.678 --> 07:29.580
There's nothing more important
in a marriage than communication.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.345
ls there any chance
of you guys getting back together?

07:32.418 --> 07:33.578
About as much chance

07:33.653 --> 07:37.089
<i>as you getting through Tool Time
without a fire or flood.</i>

07:37.156 --> 07:39.021
lt doesn't look too good, does it?

07:39.091 --> 07:40.456
No.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.162
No, it's over, Tim.

07:43.262 --> 07:47.028
l took my marriage for granted
and now l'm having to pay the price.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.201
Do you know what it's like to go home
to an 1 8-room mansion

07:51.304 --> 07:54.740
and there's no one to share it with
but your domestic staff?

07:58.044 --> 08:00.342
Can't say as l do, Bud.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.746
Well, let me tell you, Tim,
it's no fun.

08:04.917 --> 08:08.375
l should have been more open-minded
when she wanted to get help.

08:09.255 --> 08:12.156
Now l'm a lonely, lonely desperate man.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.854
Bud, Bud, Bud, you're not desperate.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.395
- Yes, l am.
- No, you're not.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.623
Yeah.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.961
Oh. Al, you and your mother
doing anything tonight?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.637
Just bingo at the senior center.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.732
- You want to come?
- Love to.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.009
Great.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.842
You can't get more desperate than that.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.847
l'm so glad you came.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.221
Well, l don't want to end up like Bud.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.828
Although l certainly would like
a domestic staff.

08:53.165 --> 08:54.996
- Look, scones.
- Yeah.

08:57.670 --> 09:01.970
Jill. l'm so glad to see you.
l'm glad you made it.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.271
Me, too.
This is my husband, Tim.

09:04.343 --> 09:06.709
- This is my friend, Mary Ellen.
- Nice to meet you.

09:06.779 --> 09:11.307
Hi. Jill told me you're a little nervous
'cause this is your first workshop.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.909
Well, the first one
without a bench grinder.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.788
My husband was nervous
his first time, too.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.722
But by the end of the first session

09:19.792 --> 09:23.159
Dr. Emory had him
in the fetal position

09:23.262 --> 09:25.526
sobbing like a baby.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.234
What time did you want me
picking you up?

09:34.307 --> 09:37.538
Here, come on. We're gonna
sign our names on these name tags.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.578
Look, nobody's gonna make you cry.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.546
All you have to do
is be open and honest.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.619
All right.

09:51.857 --> 09:55.349
Let's do an exercise that will help
everyone get to know each other.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.524
You'll start out by saying, ''Something
you might not know about me is...''

09:59.599 --> 10:01.499
And then you'll finish that sentence

10:01.567 --> 10:04.695
by revealing something deep and intimate
about yourself.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.276
Why don't you go first, Tim?

10:13.212 --> 10:14.440
What?

10:15.081 --> 10:18.244
Yes. ''Something you might not
know about me is...''

10:20.353 --> 10:22.116
Where did you get your degree?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.821
You have to excuse him.
He's new at this.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.589
l'm the graduate student in psychology.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.723
Yes, you mentioned that several times
on your application.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.562
As well as your grade point average.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.033
Four-point-oh.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.106
Why don't we start out
with a veteran of my workshops?

10:41.173 --> 10:42.231
Howard.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.574
Sure. Uh...

10:47.380 --> 10:50.144
Something you might not
know about me is...

10:52.184 --> 10:55.745
...when l was in the third grade...

10:55.855 --> 10:57.345
[sobbing]

11:12.738 --> 11:14.433
Yo, Howie. Howie!

11:15.074 --> 11:18.237
lt's an all-day seminar.
You might want to pace yourself.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.477
Scone?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.349
Repressed anger can often
be a problem in marriages.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.444
When we keep things bottled up inside

11:28.521 --> 11:30.887
they can surface
at inappropriate moments.

11:30.956 --> 11:34.585
Would anyone like to share an angry
moment they've been holding on to?

11:35.761 --> 11:38.059
- Tim.
- l'd like to share an angry moment.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.661
- Go. No, no, go!
- OK.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.734
[sighing]

11:42.835 --> 11:46.168
l went to an auto parts store
to pick up some windshield wipers,

11:47.139 --> 11:48.800
to replace them on my Mustang.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.342
lt said on the box,
''Will fit any Ford''.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.843
A Mustang's a Ford, isn't it?

11:52.912 --> 11:55.472
l get them home,
they're the clip-on type, not snap-on.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.742
They didn't fit.
l couldn't use them.

11:57.817 --> 12:01.776
They would not give my money back
because they were used!

12:01.887 --> 12:03.582
[exhaling]

12:10.796 --> 12:12.764
This is your big angry moment?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.230
You bet.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.761
lt's been with me a long time.
lt's great to get it off my chest.

12:19.271 --> 12:22.001
What has that got to do
with your marriage?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.338
l was married at the time.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.216
- [sobbing]
- OK. OK, yeah.

12:32.184 --> 12:36.450
One thing that can strain a marriage
is failing to live up to expectations.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.049
Does Jill live up to your expectations?

12:40.126 --> 12:41.388
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.826
She's a great wife
and a wonderful mother.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.159
l'd steer clear of her lasagna, though.

12:47.666 --> 12:51.102
You see, that is Tim in a nutshell.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.799
You ask him a question about the
relationship, he comes back with a joke.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.104
l got the laugh, though.

12:57.176 --> 13:01.306
lt sounds like Tim might not be
living up to all your expectations.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.247
Well, l suppose in a way that's true.

13:04.316 --> 13:07.547
There are times l wish he were
more in touch with my feelings.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.916
lt's like l have to
spell everything out for him.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.687
- Can you give us an example?
- You gotta spell it out for him, too.

13:19.665 --> 13:20.791
OK.

13:20.866 --> 13:24.233
There was this one time
when we were on vacation.

13:24.303 --> 13:28.262
Gorgeous night, full moon,
we're walking along the beach.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.005
l looked in his eyes and l said,

13:32.812 --> 13:37.476
''l never thought that l could love
anyone as much as l love you''.

13:39.518 --> 13:42.419
And he looked into my eyes and said,

13:43.722 --> 13:47.089
''Do you think
they rent dune buggies here?''

13:51.831 --> 13:53.992
How did you feel at that moment?

13:55.401 --> 13:56.959
Alone.

13:57.036 --> 14:00.199
- All alone.
- Would you like to respond to that?

14:00.272 --> 14:01.967
Oh, yeah.

14:02.908 --> 14:06.435
But if l did l'm afraid
l'd be driving home alone. Alone!

14:07.213 --> 14:09.977
No, l want you to.
That's why we came here.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.608
All right.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.882
- You know what l think?
- Not what you think, Tim.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.585
- What you feel.
- Oh.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.997
l feel like Jill's a little
demanding sometimes.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.626
She just doesn't expect me to know
what she feels at a beach,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.000
she expects me to know what she feels
all the time.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.632
Since l don't belong
to the Psychic Friends Network,

14:35.741 --> 14:37.299
l don't know what she's feeling.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.845
She ends up getting mad at me
and starts to criticize me.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.677
- How can you say that?
- He asked me to.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.144
l am not demanding.
l am not critical.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.154
Jill, there's no need to be defensive.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.055
l'm not defensive.
Am l defensive?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.423
- l'd say so.
- Who asked you?

14:57.096 --> 15:01.533
Jill, it sounds like Tim has some
problems the two of you need to address.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.831
But l think it was commendable
he was able to open up.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.499
This is great. lf you liked that,
you're gonna love this.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.577
Wanna know another truth
about that beach weekend?

15:14.680 --> 15:17.843
She takes me to a bed and breakfast
loaded with doilies and teas,

15:17.917 --> 15:20.215
no television, on lndy weekend!

15:20.853 --> 15:23.879
You made him go on lndy weekend?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.385
lt was the only time
l could get a reservation.

15:27.459 --> 15:30.223
- l can't believe he went.
- Luckiest woman on earth.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.229
- l agree.
- Well.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.425
We know what the women think,
heard what the men think.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.801
Howie, what do you think?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.340
[sobbing]

15:58.691 --> 16:00.784
Problem, my good neighborette?

16:00.859 --> 16:04.693
The pizza is round, the garbage can
is round, why can't the box be round?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.290
Well, Jill, from where l stand

16:09.368 --> 16:12.394
l sense it's more than the pizza box
that's troubling you.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.840
Yeah, yeah, everyone's a psychologist.
You, Tim, that sniveling wimp, Howard.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.308
l take it the workshop didn't go
as swimmingly as you hoped it would?

16:23.382 --> 16:25.475
Complete disaster.

16:25.551 --> 16:29.578
Tim spent the entire time
complaining about me.

16:29.655 --> 16:34.422
He said that l have been criticizing him
since the day we were married.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.725
He told that wedding story when we were
standing in front of the minister

16:38.797 --> 16:41.960
and he said, ''l do''
and l said, ''You're mumbling''.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.799
l couldn't help myself.
He's a mumbler.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.104
You felt compelled to remind him of this
on your wedding day?

16:51.176 --> 16:53.235
You know what else?
He said l'm demanding.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.280
You don't think so, do you, Wilson?

16:55.381 --> 16:58.350
- Well, Jill...
- Come on. l don't have all night.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.185
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.281
Loud and clear.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.916
Tim's right.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.823
l am.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.160
l'm a badgering, nagging shrew.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.258
All l'm missing is a rolling pin
and a bun in my hair.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.394
Oh, no!
l've got the bun!

17:19.805 --> 17:23.468
[chuckling] Jill, don't you think
you're being hard on yourself?

17:23.541 --> 17:25.031
No. No, l'm not.

17:25.109 --> 17:29.479
The entire group at Dr. Emory's agreed
that l am too critical of Tim.

17:29.581 --> 17:32.607
And l've been doing it for 1 7 years!

17:32.684 --> 17:34.208
Hmm. Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

17:35.988 --> 17:39.890
l don't know how to change.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.721
l mean, l want to.

17:42.661 --> 17:47.223
Well, Jill, that reminds me of
a very famous Chinese proverb.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.592
''A journey of 1 ,000 miles begins
with a single step.''

17:53.138 --> 17:57.040
Maybe the first step should be
that l go up and apologize to Tim.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.371
Good idea.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.471
By the way, this Dr. Emory,
is he a tall, thin, dark-haired gent?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.914
- Why? Do you know him?
- Very well.

18:05.017 --> 18:09.078
As a matter of fact, we competed
against each other in a scone bake-off.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.752
- Tim?
- ln here.

18:14.426 --> 18:18.157
l've been thinking a lot
about what you said at the workshop.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.358
l know, l know.
You're mad at me and you're right.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.799
l went overboard
and l unloaded on you unfairly.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.236
l was... l was just showing off
for Howie and the guys.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.240
No, look. You're not the one
who should be apologizing.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.869
- Why not? l'm wrong, right?
- No!

18:32.945 --> 18:36.904
Oh, God. l criticize you so much
you think everything's your fault.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.040
l'm sorry.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.746
Please stop apologizing
and let me apologize.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.448
Whoa. You're gonna apologize?

18:46.058 --> 18:49.824
You better walk me through this
'cause this is uncharted territory.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.190
Sit down.

18:56.435 --> 18:57.697
l'm sorry.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.065
- Apology accepted.
- l'm not finished yet.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.731
Wow. This is new territory.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.867
l am too critical of you.

19:04.943 --> 19:06.672
l don't want to be the kind of wife

19:06.745 --> 19:09.714
who complains about
everything her husband does.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.215
Come on, come on, come on.
We both have our faults.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.650
Sometimes l leave my underwear
on the floor.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.688
Sometimes you're bossy and you nag.

19:16.755 --> 19:19.315
- You're neurotic, you criticize...
- Tim!

19:20.993 --> 19:23.325
Now l know why it's taken
so long for me to do this.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.955
No, no, you did fine.
You're not real good at this.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.827
You'll get better at it.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.629
What did l leave out?

19:30.202 --> 19:33.569
Well, generally, when l apologize,
l give you a kiss.

19:40.145 --> 19:43.012
You're gonna be a good apologizer.
lt takes some time.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.708
Pretty soon you'll be as good as me.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.911
You'll be able to say you're sorry
and not really mean it.

19:53.725 --> 19:57.661
[Emory] When men get together
they rib each other in the name of fun.

19:57.729 --> 20:02.462
But sometimes this joking masks
an underlying layer of hostility.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.503
Do any of you feel this
in your relationship with other men?

20:05.604 --> 20:07.037
- Tim.
- No.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.308
Anybody else?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.347
- l got something to say.
- Anybody else?

20:16.448 --> 20:19.383
- l don't believe Al was finished.
- Thank you.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.942
The truth is,
when Tim makes fun of my weight,

20:22.020 --> 20:23.783
and my wearing flannel...

20:23.855 --> 20:25.618
He says he's just joking,

20:25.724 --> 20:30.286
but l think he has
an underlying resentment toward me.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.727
Tim, would you like to respond to that?

20:32.798 --> 20:34.356
No.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.993
l gotta say, you're kind of rough on Al.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.629
Personally, l think
that's why his mom overeats.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.283
<i>You know, Tim, l have caught
one or two episodes of Tool Time.</i>

20:52.351 --> 20:55.184
l must say there is
a mean-spirited undercurrent.

20:55.254 --> 20:59.088
<i>l agree. Why don't you just
change the name to Cruel Time?</i>

21:00.592 --> 21:02.355
With Tim ''The Cruel Man'' Taylor.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.987
The last show was unbelievable.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.692
You squirted oil all over Al.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.598
He never even saw it coming.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.001
[sobbing] lt was heartbreaking.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.166
Tim, it's obvious
there's something deep down

21:17.242 --> 21:19.938
- that's bringing out this resentment.
- Yeah.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.846
Why don't you tell us
what the problem really is?

21:27.386 --> 21:28.853
[sniffling]

21:34.826 --> 21:37.386
[sobbing] We're out of scones.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.036
Still working on that paper
about the cafeteria?

21:47.105 --> 21:50.597
Oh, yeah. The story's exploded.
We're talking big breaking news.

21:50.676 --> 21:54.237
According to my sources,
what the school is selling as pork stew,

21:54.346 --> 21:56.280
is actually made from tofu.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.074
What?

21:59.918 --> 22:01.351
Tofu?

22:01.420 --> 22:04.685
God, they're passing that stuff off
as good, wholesome pork?

22:08.026 --> 22:09.516
''Hello, my name is Al?''

22:11.196 --> 22:12.356
Ohhh!

22:13.305 --> 22:19.851
