09:24.565 --> 09:26.400
<b>- I guess I do</b>

09:26.400 --> 09:28.202
<b>without a ball banging</b>

09:31.471 --> 09:33.307
<b>as you write your poems.</b>

09:33.307 --> 09:35.275
<b>- See?</b>
<b>Now, you two make up,</b>

09:35.275 --> 09:37.578

<b>[all sigh]</b>

10:10.043 --> 10:11.178
<b>[both sigh]</b>

10:11.178 --> 10:12.646

10:12.646 --> 10:14.915
<b>- Nothing would</b>
