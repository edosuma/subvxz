or you'll miss your plane.'

01:24.433 --> 01:25.600
Good luck.

01:25.633 --> 01:26.533
Good luck
on your new job.

01:26.566 --> 01:28.600
Thanks. I'll write every day.
I promise.

01:28.633 --> 01:30.300
‐ Okay, bye.
‐ Bye.

01:36.666 --> 01:39.166
Well, Balki, I..

01:39.200 --> 01:41.466
...guess you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.200
Oh, no, no, cousin.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.033
I mean,
she's going away

01:46.066 --> 01:49.400
but that don't change our
feelings for one another and..

01:49.433 --> 01:51.233
...she'll stop by when she's
in the neighborhood.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.666
Stop by when she's
in the neighborhood?

01:55.700 --> 01:58.766
Balki, Mary Anne
is moving to London.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.466
I know what you're feeling.
I've been there.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.033
You've been to London?

02:04.633 --> 02:07.566
No. No.. Here.
Balki, sit down.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.733
I've had
a traumatic experience

02:14.766 --> 02:16.366
like the one
you're about to have.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.766
When I was
in fifth grade

02:19.800 --> 02:23.033
I was in love
with Carolyn Smyser.

02:23.066 --> 02:25.200
Every day
we'd eat lunch together.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.733
We'd walk home from
school holding hands.

02:27.766 --> 02:32.100
And then one day
she dropped a bomb on me.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.400
She was a terrorist?

02:40.166 --> 02:41.433
No.

02:41.466 --> 02:43.600
Th‐the bomb,
was it a water bomb?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.333
‐ No.
‐ A flea and tick bomb?

02:48.533 --> 02:50.033
Balki, no, no.

02:50.066 --> 02:53.000
Just‐just..
Just listen.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.500
Carolyn's father..

02:57.533 --> 02:59.166
...Carolyn's father bought a..

02:59.200 --> 03:01.633
...cattle ranch in Texas

03:01.666 --> 03:04.166
and she told me
she'd write every day

03:04.200 --> 03:06.466
and that she'd spend her
summer vacation's in Madison.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.266
And that
we'd always be together.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.733
A lip bomb?

03:16.333 --> 03:20.366
Try not to speak..

03:20.400 --> 03:22.133
... until I point to you.

03:23.566 --> 03:24.566
Okay?

03:28.200 --> 03:32.066
Well, for a while, I got
a letter from Carolyn every day

03:32.100 --> 03:36.600
and then once a week
and then a card at Christmas.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.400
Then...nothing.

03:39.533 --> 03:43.300
That girl
I‐I'd loved..

03:43.333 --> 03:45.666
...was gone...forever.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
That's
the saddest story..

03:59.700 --> 04:01.500
...I've ever heard.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.600
What does that have
to do with Mary Anne?

04:08.533 --> 04:11.033
It's the same thing.

04:11.066 --> 04:13.266
Mary Anne's new life
will be filled with..

04:13.300 --> 04:16.233
...with glamour
and excitement.

04:16.266 --> 04:18.233
Well, she'll be..

04:18.266 --> 04:20.399
...too tired to write.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.533
She'll forget to call.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.666
She won't have time
to visit.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.533
Balki, she means well

04:27.566 --> 04:29.633
but face it,
that chick is gone.

04:31.633 --> 04:34.533
Oh, cousin I had no idea
I hurt so much

04:34.566 --> 04:37.533
until you
pointed it out to me.

04:37.566 --> 04:38.533
Hey..

04:39.800 --> 04:41.533
That's what friends
are for.

05:02.666 --> 05:05.566
Balki, it's three o'clock
in the morning.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.033
What are you doing?

05:08.066 --> 05:10.600
I'm listening to the
refrigerator turn on and off.

05:13.533 --> 05:16.633
Well, that sounds like
something worth doing.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.433
Balki, why do‐don't you
try and get some sleep.

05:18.466 --> 05:19.333
No, cousin.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.600
We need to go to work
in a few hours.

05:21.633 --> 05:22.633
I don't care.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.366
I...It‐it don't matter.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.766
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.633
I can't do anything
except think about..

05:30.666 --> 05:33.400
...except think about...
Mary Anne.

05:40.466 --> 05:42.533
You feel like
you wanna die, don't you?

05:49.066 --> 05:50.566

05:50.600 --> 05:52.333
...if you wanna stop
thinking

05:52.366 --> 05:53.600
about Mary Anne, you know
what you have to do?

05:53.633 --> 05:55.166
No.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.166
You have to get
yourself a hobby.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.733
‐ A hobby?
‐ Yes.

06:01.766 --> 06:04.533
Yes, a hobby.
Something new and exciting

06:04.566 --> 06:06.200
to take your mind off her.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.766
I got over Caroline Smyser
By taking up photography.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.433
Really?

06:10.466 --> 06:12.100
Yes, I spent so much time
taking pictures

06:12.133 --> 06:13.366
that I forgot all about her.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.133
Really?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.300
Yes, I even joined a photography
club and met a lot of people.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.433
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.466
There must be something
that you've always wanted to do.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.700
No, there isn't.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.100
There's got to be one thing

06:25.133 --> 06:27.266
that you've always dreamed
of doing.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.200
There is one thing.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.200
Good, what is it?

06:32.233 --> 06:34.366
‐ Sheep vaulting.
‐ Well, there you go.

06:37.466 --> 06:40.233
Sheep vaulting?

06:40.266 --> 06:41.800
Cousin, it is the number one

06:41.833 --> 06:44.266
spectator sport on Mypos.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.733
Stop me if I have
told you this before.

06:46.766 --> 06:49.400
I was actually there
when Tony Tomopolos

06:49.433 --> 06:52.433
jumped over 37 sheep
in one vault.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.466
Unfortunately
he was trying for 38.

07:00.766 --> 07:02.800
On Mypos they still
use that shot

07:02.833 --> 07:05.700
at the beginning
of White Wilder Sports.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.700
They call it,
"The thrill of victory

07:10.733 --> 07:13.266
the agony of the sheep."

07:19.166 --> 07:21.033
Sheep vaulting?

07:22.666 --> 07:26.166
Balki, I‐I don't think
sheep vaulting

07:26.200 --> 07:29.200
has hit the States yet.

07:29.233 --> 07:31.400
But just look wha‐what
talking about a new hobby

07:31.433 --> 07:32.566
has done for you already.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.233
‐ What has it done for me?
‐ It's taking your mind off her.

07:35.266 --> 07:36.666
‐ Who?
‐ Mary Anne.

07:40.666 --> 07:42.033

07:51.566 --> 07:53.566

where Balki is.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.800
Where's Balki?

07:57.833 --> 08:00.133
He took
the day off.

08:00.166 --> 08:02.066
Ask him why?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.400
Why?

08:03.433 --> 08:05.600
As I explained
to Harriette

08:05.633 --> 08:08.433
Balki's been very upset ever
since Mary Anne moved to London

08:08.466 --> 08:11.233
so I gave him a little advise
about how to handle it.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.233
And he's out..

08:13.266 --> 08:14.666
...following my advice.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.166
Now, ask him what
the advice was.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.366
I told him if he wanted
to take his mind off Mary Anne

08:23.400 --> 08:26.666
he should find a hobby
maybe join a club.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.166
I told him to check out
coin collecting

08:29.200 --> 08:31.533

historical walks‐‐

08:31.566 --> 08:34.433
Balki's suffering
from a broken heart

08:34.466 --> 08:38.566
and you told him to take
a historical walk?

08:38.600 --> 08:42.732
Take it from a professional
advice columnist, Larry.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.333
Your advice stinks.

08:49.566 --> 08:51.466
I can't believe
I'm about to say this

08:51.500 --> 08:54.133
but Lydia's right.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.400
Harriette,
oh, thank you.

08:57.433 --> 08:58.766
If Balki doesn't
get some help

08:58.800 --> 09:02.400
he's going to end up
as crazy as she is.

09:02.433 --> 09:05.033
You just
cannot pay me a compliment

09:05.066 --> 09:06.566
and let it drop, can you?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.100
I mean, would it kill you
just to be nice?

09:09.133 --> 09:10.700
Nice?

09:10.733 --> 09:12.466
I've got one nerve left
and you're leaning on it.

09:14.633 --> 09:16.300
You'll see.

09:16.333 --> 09:20.500
When Balki finds a hobby,
he'll be a new man.

It's a loaner.

Joining a club
is just what I needed

those old ladies
can really put up a fight.

some sense into you.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.733
Now, come on. Let's go.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.766
Who's the pocket yuppie?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.033
Oh, this is my cousin, Larry.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.600
Cousin, this is my
new friend, Cobra.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.133
It's spelled
just like the snake.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.233
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Mr. Cobra.

15:11.366 --> 15:12.533
String tie.

15:12.566 --> 15:13.366
Nice look for you.

15:17.766 --> 15:19.166
Listen, I'd love
to stay and chat

15:19.200 --> 15:20.633
but I‐I really just stopped
by to get Balki.

15:20.666 --> 15:21.766
So if you'll excuse us‐‐

15:21.800 --> 15:23.600
Hey!

15:23.633 --> 15:25.500
The kid stays.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.466
He makes us laugh.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.433
Well, you know if it's‐if it's
laughs you're looking for

15:29.466 --> 15:32.700
I‐I could send you
some comedy albums.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.066
Y‐you like Steve Martin?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.133
Robin Williams?

15:37.166 --> 15:38.600
Oh, w‐what about Jay Leno?

15:38.633 --> 15:39.466
He rides a motorcycle.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.666
Jay leno?

15:42.800 --> 15:45.400
Jay Leno's funny.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.766
But..

15:46.800 --> 15:48.700
...he's no Garry Shandling!

15:51.466 --> 15:52.533
I can get Shandling.

15:54.100 --> 15:54.666
You know what I think, pal?

15:56.566 --> 15:59.200
I think you came
to the wrong place..

15:59.233 --> 16:00.600
...at the wrong time.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.700
Oh, oh.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.366
What are you doing
to my cousin, Larry?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.566
Cousin, I..

16:09.600 --> 16:12.566
It's just a little game we play.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.633
It's called target practice.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.133
Cobra..

16:17.166 --> 16:19.733
...I'm beginning to think
there's a dark side to you.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.633
I don't think
I wanna be in your club.

16:28.133 --> 16:28.700
That's okay.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.266
You don't have to join

16:31.300 --> 16:32.266
but..

16:34.266 --> 16:36.566
...we're still going to go
ahead with the initiation.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.366
Hey! A beer truck just
overturned down the street!

16:46.400 --> 16:48.033
'There's free beer
for everyone!'

16:48.066 --> 16:49.100
(all)
Yeah!

16:51.400 --> 16:52.433
I'll be back.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.465
Balki, Balki, stop!

17:19.133 --> 17:20.300
Let me help you down.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.566
‐ Come on. Okay? Ready?
‐ Yes.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.133
One, two, three, ugh!

17:25.165 --> 17:27.566
One, two, three, ugh!

17:27.599 --> 17:29.766
One, two, three, ugh!

17:29.800 --> 17:31.233
Alright, stop.

17:31.266 --> 17:32.566
Unh! Stop.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.133
Unh! Stop.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.366
Unh! Balki, stop it!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.200
Balki.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.033
Reach for that chair.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.666
Balki..

18:06.433 --> 18:07.700
...with your foot.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.166
Reach with your foot. Go on.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.366
Go on.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.733
Go ahead. Reach.

18:14.766 --> 18:17.300
Oh, just.. G‐good.
Go ahead. Reach.

18:17.333 --> 18:18.533
Alright, here, let me help you.

18:18.566 --> 18:21.266
Reach.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.766
Reach, reach, reach.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.333
Oh! Aah!

18:24.366 --> 18:25.466
Aah! Aah!

18:25.500 --> 18:27.533
Oh. Alright. Pull it over.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.400
Come here. Alright.
Good. Good. Good.

18:30.433 --> 18:32.200
Alright. Alright.

18:32.233 --> 18:34.133
Come on.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.233
That‐a‐boy. Okay.

18:37.266 --> 18:39.433
Alright.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.533
Okay. Balki, help me down.

18:41.566 --> 18:45.066
Cousin, cousin, do it for me.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.666
‐ No, no, Balki.
‐ 'Oh, please, cousin.'

18:46.700 --> 18:49.033
Please, please, Mr. Scarecrow..

18:49.066 --> 18:50.066
...which way
to the Emerald city?

18:52.733 --> 18:55.166
(both)
Some people go that way

18:55.200 --> 18:56.766
and some people
go that way.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.233
Of course...people do go
both ways.

18:59.266 --> 19:00.333
I love it!

19:00.366 --> 19:01.666
I love it!

19:01.700 --> 19:02.633
I love it!

19:04.566 --> 19:05.533
Balki!

19:07.333 --> 19:08.133
Get me down!

19:12.600 --> 19:14.633
Oh, oh, oh.

19:14.666 --> 19:15.600
‐ Oh, oh.
‐ Oh, oh.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.066
Oh!

19:22.333 --> 19:24.066
What's this?

19:24.100 --> 19:25.366
I thought
I was riding with kitten lips.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.400
‐ Get 'em.
‐ Alright, hold it!

19:30.433 --> 19:31.733
Don't come any closer!

19:44.700 --> 19:45.600
[glass breaking]

19:49.333 --> 19:51.100
Is that what you
were trying to do?

19:55.700 --> 19:56.800
Well, I wasn't going
for the head.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.700
No, you were going for
this kind of piston movement..

19:59.733 --> 20:02.366
[indistinct chattering]

20:06.300 --> 20:07.533
You know sometimes
the label covers

20:07.566 --> 20:09.266
over the part of the bottle..

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
(both)
Yes, that was it.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.433
Let's go.

20:15.466 --> 20:16.600
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.533
It's initiation time!

20:18.566 --> 20:21.533
(all)
Yeah!

20:21.566 --> 20:23.266
Oh, look!

20:23.300 --> 20:24.100
There's Elvis!

20:26.200 --> 20:29.333
‐ Where's Elvis?
‐ I don't see Elvis.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.500
Cousin, I‐I want to..

20:31.833 --> 20:34.266
Hey, get those guys!

20:34.300 --> 20:35.533
‐ Hey!
‐ Yeah!

20:45.800 --> 20:47.400
[both panting]

20:52.333 --> 20:53.633
‐ Are you sure we lost them?
‐ Positive.

20:53.666 --> 20:56.066
Are you sure you didn't
tell them where you live?

20:56.100 --> 20:56.966
Positive.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.033
Are you sure you never
told them your name?

20:59.066 --> 21:00.333
‐ Positive.
‐ Ah, good.

21:00.366 --> 21:02.200
I think we're safe.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.200
Of course, I did give your name
and address as a reference.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.466
You what?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.066
‐ Just kidding.
‐ Oh.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.566
Cousins should joke more.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.300
Balki..

21:13.333 --> 21:15.333
...let me give you
a little tip.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.200
Anytime you meet someone

21:18.233 --> 21:20.400
with the word "death"

21:20.433 --> 21:22.433
tattooed anywhere
on their body..

21:28.233 --> 21:30.433
...stay away.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.666
Words to live by.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.266
Oh, cousin, I should
have listened to you

21:39.300 --> 21:41.433
when you told me not to join
the motor psychos.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.700
Well..

21:42.733 --> 21:45.666
...I can understand
why you did it.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.533
It's the only thing that kept
your mind off Mary Anne.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.366
[sobbing]

21:54.700 --> 21:55.533
Oops.

21:58.533 --> 22:03.033
[crying]
I'm never going to get over her.

22:03.066 --> 22:04.333
[knock on door]

22:12.300 --> 22:13.800
Mary Anne!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.533
Do you have to keep
mentioning her name?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.600
Balki.

22:19.633 --> 22:22.566
Oh, boy,
now I'm hearing her voice.

22:25.633 --> 22:26.600
Balki?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.300
Cousin, I'm halluciginating.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.433
Balki, this is Mary Anne.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.333
Mary Anne.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.233
You came back.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.500
You came back.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.133
I came back.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.166
Nice outfit.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.666
Mary Anne, why did
you come back?

22:55.700 --> 22:57.233
Oh, I had to.

22:57.266 --> 22:59.433
I missed Chicago..

22:59.466 --> 23:01.500
...but most of all,
I missed you.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.662
Well, believe me, Mary Anne

23:08.695 --> 23:10.962
Balki missed you, too.

23:10.995 --> 23:13.595
Mary Anne, you are
not going to believe

23:13.629 --> 23:15.562
what happened
while you were gone.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.562
I can hardly believe it myself.

23:17.595 --> 23:19.929
‐ What?
‐ Cousin Larry saw Elvis.

23:30.862 --> 23:33.462
[theme music]
