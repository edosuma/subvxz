<i>thinking to himself,</i>
<i>why am I in prison?</i>

02:47.701 --> 02:51.336
<i>I'm in prison because of some</i>
<i>backwards bullshit,</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:54.473
<i>narcissistic,</i>
<i>[bleep] sucking government</i>

<i>in this shit game we call</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

03:01.282 --> 03:04.116
<i>So he starts</i>
<i>planning an escape.</i>

03:04.118 --> 03:07.352
<i>And so, like, he made friends</i>
<i>with, uh, the people</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:08.820
<i>that have been</i>
<i>in prison the longest.</i>

03:08.822 --> 03:12.057
<i>They tell him, like, uh--</i>
<i>well, there's a cable</i>

03:12.059 --> 03:14.059
<i>that runs over the prison.</i>

03:14.061 --> 03:17.829
<i>That, if someone had the guts,</i>
<i>they could crawl across</i>

03:17.831 --> 03:20.165
<i>that wire</i>
<i>and probably get free,</i>

03:20.167 --> 03:23.502
<i>and that's how</i>
<i>you get out of here, baby.</i>

03:23.504 --> 03:25.070
- He called him baby.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.271
- [laughing] Yeah.

03:26.273 --> 03:31.443
<i>Okay, so he meets every Sunday</i>
<i>with his wife, Rosemary.</i>

03:31.445 --> 03:34.713
<i>And he's like--</i>
<i>uh, I love you.</i>

03:34.715 --> 03:35.681
<i>You're amazing.</i>

03:35.683 --> 03:36.481
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

03:36.483 --> 03:40.886
<i>I want to get out of prison,</i>
<i>so let's raise some money</i>

03:40.888 --> 03:42.321
<i>and figure out a way</i>
<i>for someone</i>

03:42.323 --> 03:46.091
<i>to get me the [bleep]</i>
<i>out of this shit hole.</i>

03:46.693 --> 03:50.028
Rosemary raised $23,000.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.297
<i>Gave it to</i>
<i>the Weather Underground.</i>

03:52.299 --> 03:53.465
So the Weather Underground

03:53.467 --> 03:55.400
was a group of
activist students.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.736
<i>They were like,</i>
<i>listen, if you really want to</i>

03:57.738 --> 04:01.740
<i>get out of this prison,</i>
<i>do it in late September.</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:05.077
<i>'Cause that's when</i>
<i>the fogs come in.</i>

04:05.079 --> 04:06.845
<i>And so he waits.</i>

04:06.847 --> 04:08.113
<i>And he starts working out.</i>

04:08.115 --> 04:13.418
<i>So Timothy Leary was, like,</i>
<i>playing handball, sit-ups,</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.487
<i>working out in the day.</i>

04:15.489 --> 04:18.056
Timothy Leary
was playing handball,

04:18.058 --> 04:20.492
doing [bleep] bench presses,

04:20.494 --> 04:22.928
sit-ups, getting ripped.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.532
So on September 12, 1970,

04:27.534 --> 04:30.602
<i>it's foggy, it's the</i>
<i>perfect time to escape.</i>

04:30.604 --> 04:33.905
<i>So Dr. Timothy Leary decided,</i>

04:33.907 --> 04:35.807
<i>all right, I'm gonna</i>
<i>get the [bleep] out</i>

04:35.809 --> 04:38.210
<i>of this stupid shit hole.</i>

04:38.645 --> 04:41.713
<i>So he creeps out of his cell,</i>
<i>gets out of there.</i>

04:41.715 --> 04:45.017
<i>Goes out into the hallway,</i>
<i>and he looks around the hall.</i>

04:45.019 --> 04:47.953
<i>So he sneaks around</i>
<i>into a doorway that opens up</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:48.787
<i>to the prison yard.</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:53.058
<i>Runs across the prison yard</i>
<i>in the dead of the night.</i>

04:53.060 --> 04:55.060
<i>He avoids the light.</i>

04:55.062 --> 04:57.429
<i>And, uh, climbs up a tree.</i>

04:57.431 --> 04:58.363
<i>He climbs up a tree.</i>

04:58.365 --> 05:01.967
<i>And he's, like, on the rooftop</i>
<i>like a squirrel.</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:04.970
Runs that way through it.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.672
<i>And there's the wire.</i>

05:06.674 --> 05:08.340
<i>So he gets to the cable,</i>

05:08.342 --> 05:10.976
<i>he begins to</i>
<i>climb across the cable.</i>

05:10.978 --> 05:15.180
So he's hanging--
really think about this, man!

05:15.182 --> 05:16.515
- [chuckling]

05:16.517 --> 05:18.016

people that ever lived!

05:21.055 --> 05:24.022
This is one of
the smartest of us.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.290
- I'm with you.
- All right.

05:25.292 --> 05:29.761
<i>So halfway through the cable,</i>
<i>he thinks to himself,</i>

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
<i>I'm out of energy.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:33.498
<i>They're gonna</i>
<i>poke me out of here</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:36.068
<i>like a [bleep] sloth in a tree.</i>

05:36.070 --> 05:37.469
<i>With a stick.</i>

05:37.471 --> 05:38.403
<i>Or maybe a dog.</i>

05:38.405 --> 05:41.473
<i>And then he found something</i>
<i>deep inside of him,</i>

05:41.475 --> 05:42.541
<i>some reservoir of energy</i>

05:42.543 --> 05:44.710
<i>and he's like--</i>
<i>no, I'm gonna keep moving.</i>

05:44.712 --> 05:48.613
<i>And I'm gonna climb across</i>
<i>this [bleep] cable.</i>

05:48.615 --> 05:49.614
And that's what he did.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.450
<i>Climbed across the cable,</i>

05:51.452 --> 05:52.217
<i>dropped down.</i>

05:52.219 --> 05:56.154
<i>So Leary's running down</i>
<i>the [bleep] road.</i>

05:56.156 --> 05:58.623
Half mile,
he's been training for this.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.592
<i>Rocky Balboa was--</i>

06:00.594 --> 06:03.061
<i>[both laughing]</i>

06:03.063 --> 06:05.564
He was Rocky Balboa.
He--

06:05.566 --> 06:06.998
[both laughing]

06:07.000 --> 06:10.369
- Now you have to say it.
- He was Rocky Balboa!

06:10.371 --> 06:12.704
<i>He was running down the street.</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:13.572
<i>Van pulls up.</i>

06:13.574 --> 06:16.742
<i>It's the Weather Underground,</i>
<i>and they're like...</i>

06:16.744 --> 06:17.542
<i>[laughs]</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:20.512
<i>Man, let's go to Algeria,</i>

<i>[giggles]</i>

06:22.950 --> 06:25.016
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:28.086

06:28.088 --> 06:29.721
<i>He gets sentenced to Folsom.</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:33.525
<i>And then governor Jerry Brown</i>
<i>gets him a pardon.</i>

06:33.527 --> 06:35.694
He leaves a free man.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.896
He went to jail for nothing.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.565
He was in prison
'cause he was too smart.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.134
<i>If being smart was illegal,</i>

06:42.136 --> 06:45.704
<i>we would be in the best</i>

06:45.706 --> 06:48.006
<i>Being smart is not illegal.</i>

06:48.008 --> 06:52.544
<i>Being dumb is legal.</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:55.781

06:55.783 --> 06:58.116
- This is Fox

06:58.118 --> 06:59.284
It's ruining everything.

06:59.286 --> 06:59.918
I knew they would.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.788
- I thought they were being

07:02.790 --> 07:04.055
- Well, they got out.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.358

- Omaha.

07:22.242 --> 07:22.974
- How did you escape?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.543
- Oh, I just got in my car

07:24.545 --> 07:25.444
- You didn't

07:25.446 --> 07:28.914

Hello, I'm Steve Berg
and today, we're gonna be

07:35.589 --> 07:38.390
talking about Devil's Island.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.260
<i>Our story begins in 1908.</i>

07:42.262 --> 07:46.398
<i>A 15-year-old boy</i>
<i>named William Willis</i>

07:46.400 --> 07:49.167
<i>boards a boat as a seaman.</i>

07:49.169 --> 07:50.969
<i>And he learns about sailing,</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:52.671
<i>doing a little cookery,</i>

07:52.673 --> 07:53.939
<i>emptying out a latrine.</i>

07:53.941 --> 07:56.575
<i>He becomes</i>
<i>a jack of all trades.</i>

07:56.577 --> 08:00.512
<i>He's like, I'm a</i>
<i>master seaman/adventurer.</i>

08:00.514 --> 08:03.381
William was a guy
who had no idols.

08:03.383 --> 08:08.220
Except the fictional character
of Don Quixote.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.623
In 1938,
William injures his leg,

08:11.625 --> 08:13.725
<i>and it's a pretty bad</i>
<i>situation.</i>

08:13.727 --> 08:16.561
<i>So William ended up</i>
<i>at a boarding house</i>

08:16.563 --> 08:18.897
<i>run by a woman</i>
<i>named Madame Carnot,</i>

08:18.899 --> 08:21.433
<i>and she was regaling William</i>

08:21.435 --> 08:23.602
about her son, Bernard.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.905
<i>She's like,</i>
<i>my son was wrongfully accused</i>

08:26.907 --> 08:30.942
<i>of murder, and now he there,</i>
<i>rotting on an island</i>

08:30.944 --> 08:33.778
<i>in a French penal colony.</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:35.347
<i>Dying!</i>

08:35.349 --> 08:36.047
<i>Rotting!</i>

08:36.049 --> 08:39.584
Amongst the worst oppon--
am...

08:39.586 --> 08:46.024
<i>worst--amongst worst humans</i>
<i>that are basically around.</i>

08:46.026 --> 08:48.960
<i>And William's like,</i>
<i>that sounds like a travesty.</i>

08:48.962 --> 08:52.097
<i>What if I went to go</i>
<i>rescue this guy?</i>

08:52.099 --> 08:53.331
<i>He wanted to be Don Quixote.</i>

08:53.333 --> 08:55.133
And that was
a big thing for him.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.168
That's why he went on
these adventures.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.471
<i>♪ I am I Don Quixote ♪</i>

08:59.473 --> 09:00.672
<i>♪ The man of La Mancha ♪</i>

09:00.674 --> 09:04.075
<i>♪ My destiny calls</i>
<i>and I will heed ♪</i>

09:04.077 --> 09:05.110
<i>Haven't you heard that song?</i>

09:05.112 --> 09:06.645
There was a musical made
about it.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.579
- That's a great one.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.348
- I auditioned for it.
Didn't get the part.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.150
- [chuckles]
- True story.

09:12.152 --> 09:12.817
Anyway...

09:12.819 --> 09:15.654
<i>William Willis sets off</i>
<i>for Devils' Island,</i>

18:56.769 --> 18:58.102
He said out loud,

18:58.104 --> 18:59.303
<i>well, here we go.</i>

18:59.305 --> 19:03.341
<i>As the ship sinks,</i>
<i>he's riding the stern down</i>

19:03.343 --> 19:04.575
<i>like an elevator.</i>

19:04.577 --> 19:07.812
<i>Very elegant,</i>
<i>like a full-on gentleman.</i>

19:07.814 --> 19:11.082
<i>And he just gracefully</i>
<i>steps into the water.</i>

19:11.084 --> 19:14.418
<i>Doesn't even get a single hair</i>

19:14.420 --> 19:19.123
Charles Joughin was
the very last person

19:19.125 --> 19:21.692
on the RMS "Titanic."

19:21.694 --> 19:24.095
<i>Because of the amount</i>

19:24.097 --> 19:25.496
<i>he didn't feel</i>
<i>the cold at all,</i>

19:25.498 --> 19:30.101
<i>and he was able to sustain</i>
<i>the cold temperature</i>

19:30.103 --> 19:31.769
<i>for over three hours.</i>

19:31.771 --> 19:34.739
The rescue ship
finally arrived.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.875
<i>Out of the hundreds and</i>

19:37.877 --> 19:38.976

19:38.978 --> 19:40.945
<i>only six survivors.</i>

19:40.947 --> 19:42.547
<i>When he gets on the ship,</i>

19:42.549 --> 19:47.084
<i>They're immediately giving him</i>
<i>medical attention.</i>

19:47.086 --> 19:49.153
<i>And they decide</i>
<i>to thaw him out</i>

19:49.155 --> 19:50.688
<i>by putting him into a oven.</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:54.158
<i>So he goes in the oven,</i>
<i>and he's just kind of like,</i>

19:54.160 --> 19:56.227

I'm gonna shoot it with you.

20:21.487 --> 20:25.189
But do you realize, we're about
to be [bleep] freezing cold?

20:25.191 --> 20:28.025
Remember--
- This is for Charles Joughin.

20:28.027 --> 20:31.462
If he can do it,
I can do it.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.463
All right.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.967

Okay.
Whoo!

20:42.909 --> 20:44.809

20:44.811 --> 20:46.477
Ugh.
