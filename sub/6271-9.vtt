15:07.640 --> 15:10.642
[panting]

15:16.382 --> 15:18.316
- [moans]

15:20.319 --> 15:22.520
Oh, god.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.922
Ohh...

15:27.993 --> 15:30.995
[distant clattering]

15:32.531 --> 15:36.634
[sizzling, scraping]

15:42.041 --> 15:44.609
-  <i>Buenos dias, muchacha.</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:46.244
Want some coffee?

15:47.713 --> 15:49.414
- Aspirin.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.949
If you have it.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.550
- Hey, I'm making pancakes.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.353
- Not hungry.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.955
- That's okay.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.361
You want to go for a drive?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.296
There's a crafts fair
in amagansett.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.432
Thinking of getting
a real tree this year,

16:07.434 --> 16:09.033
Spruce the place up a bit.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.368
- I have to go home.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.709
- Back to your husband?

16:17.711 --> 16:19.310
- Yes.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.514
- Man, what does that
even mean to you?

16:25.084 --> 16:28.486
- [chuckles]
eat shit, oscar.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.121
- Well, that's great.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.723
I had so much fun.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.458
I'll fuck you
in another 15 years.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.327
- I won't be here
in 15 years.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.628
- No?
Where you going?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.030
- We're selling the ranch.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.734
Half of cole's money
will be mine.

16:42.736 --> 16:46.337
I'm gonna use that to get as
far away from here as possible.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.606
- A lot of money
in that place, huh?

16:48.608 --> 16:52.510
- Yeah, there's a fortune.
Where's my fucking scarf?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.745
- I did some research
a while back

16:53.747 --> 16:55.346
At the county clerk's.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.781
Yeah, I was looking
for something to use

16:56.783 --> 16:59.283
Against the lockharts
in order to get my permit.

17:01.286 --> 17:02.787
Cherry's been
refinancing for years.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.555
The place
is practically underwater.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.690
- [chuckles]
that's not true.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.258
- Yeah.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.659
If it ever sells,
you're not gonna get

17:08.661 --> 17:10.561
More than a couple mil.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.796
Divide it
between the brothers,

17:11.798 --> 17:13.464
After taxes...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.769
You're not going anywhere.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.540
- I don't believe you.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.143
- It's public record.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.511
I made copies.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.293
I'm sorry, bailey.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.328
I don't want to be
the one to tell you.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.334
- Okay.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.536
I have to go.
- Okay.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.137
It's o--

17:53.139 --> 17:54.739
- Wait.
- What?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.407
- I don't have a car.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.809
- Oh, fuck.
- I don't have a fucking car.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.544
I don't--
- okay. Okay.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.179
It's okay. It's okay.
You take my truck.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.214
It's okay.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.149
Take my truck.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.760
- What's wrong, hon?
Bad day?

18:19.698 --> 18:22.166
- Yeah, I, uh,
I heard something...

18:22.168 --> 18:23.434
About the ranch.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.769
- Yeah? From who?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.171
- Oscar.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.539
He--

18:30.576 --> 18:33.211
He said it's been
refinanced so many times,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.880
It's not really yours anymore.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.448
- [chuckles]
well...

18:37.450 --> 18:39.250
I'd like to know whose it is

18:39.252 --> 18:42.220
So they can come over here
and fix these cabinets.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.755
- He saw the files
at the county clerk's.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.591
- They're outdated, alison.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.726
If you want to get them updated,
you got to go down there.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.729
You got to do it yourself.
- No.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.264
No, they're not.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.604
- Okay.

19:01.340 --> 19:06.244
I might be a little behind
on my mortgage payments...

19:06.246 --> 19:08.913
But I've started
the process of applying

19:08.915 --> 19:12.350
For a commercial loan
against the business.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.820
It's gonna keep us solvent
until the summer people return.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.555
- There's no money left.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.890
When you sell the ranch,

19:18.892 --> 19:20.424
The bank could just take
everythin--

19:20.426 --> 19:23.161
- We're not gonna sell.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.496
- What?
- I'm not selling it.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498
That was a mistake cole made.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.534
He was upset about his brother,
which I understand,

19:29.536 --> 19:32.670
But you can't make
a sentimental decision like that

19:32.672 --> 19:34.772
About something so big.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.941
I'm gonna wait until the
commercial loan comes through,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.543
And then I'm gonna
sit the boys down

19:38.545 --> 19:39.944
And I'll tell them
the good news.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.547
- Don't you understand?

19:42.549 --> 19:45.449
They all think
they're about to be rich.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.186
They've been making plans.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.787
When they find out--

19:49.789 --> 19:52.390
- They're not going to find out.
- Of course they will.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.960
If you don't tell them,
I will.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.529
- Okay, you tell cole
your little bit of news,

19:58.531 --> 20:01.299
And then...I'll tell him

20:01.301 --> 20:03.401
About your summer lover.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.735
- [chuckles]

20:04.737 --> 20:06.470
He already knows.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.474
I told him.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.846
- Well, isn't this ironic,

20:15.848 --> 20:20.818
You telling me
what's good for my kids.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.288
I remember a time
when the roles were reversed.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.489
- What?

20:27.826 --> 20:32.830
- I told you
to take him to the hospital.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.832
Remember, I said,
"he doesn't look right.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.768
There's something wrong."

20:37.770 --> 20:39.904
But you didn't want to do it,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.006
Because you were a nurse
and you knew better.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.576
- What are you doing?
- And I didn't push...

20:45.578 --> 20:49.447
'cause it was your decision
because you're his mother.

20:49.449 --> 20:54.318
I have lived to regret
that restraint so deeply.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.920
- Don't.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.323
- We kept this family together
through an unspeakable tragedy.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.325
I took you in this house.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.761
I washed your hair.
I spoon-fed you.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.330
I pulled you back
from the brink.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.032
And this is how you repay me?

21:08.034 --> 21:10.368
- You've been lying to us all.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.372
- Alison, I have
tried so hard for so long

21:14.374 --> 21:17.742
To find love in my heart
to forgive you,

21:17.744 --> 21:22.346
And you just become
more and more hateful.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.750
I don't know why
I've held my tongue.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.953
I don't know
what good it's done.

21:28.955 --> 21:33.291
Your pride
cost him his life...

21:36.361 --> 21:37.962
My grandbaby.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.734
It should've been you.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.323
[tires screeching]

22:25.010 --> 22:26.410
- [breathless whimper]

22:29.614 --> 22:32.616
[gasping]

22:42.594 --> 22:44.028
[gasps]
oh!

22:44.030 --> 22:45.429
Shit.

22:49.434 --> 22:50.801
Oh, god.

22:56.141 --> 23:00.044
- A little girl
came in here the other day.

23:00.046 --> 23:04.448
And she had
cracked her chin open...

23:04.450 --> 23:05.783
For the second time

23:05.785 --> 23:07.518
Roller-skating.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.588
I told her not to worry,
that I once knew a little girl

23:10.590 --> 23:12.590
Who did it four times...

23:14.726 --> 23:17.027
And she turned out beautiful.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.462
Now, you know the drill.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.598
Keep it dry,
apply bacitracin,

23:20.600 --> 23:22.600
Change the bandage daily.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.008
Let's go have a talk, okay?

23:37.082 --> 23:39.517
I'd lose my license
for saying this,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.018
But if there's
one thing I've learned

23:41.020 --> 23:44.422
From 45 years of practicing...

23:44.424 --> 23:48.092
Scotch is fine medicine.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.901
You want to tell me
what's going on?

24:01.673 --> 24:04.108
- I've been thinking
of the night gabriel died.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.713
What happened?

24:09.715 --> 24:11.215
- What do you mean?

24:11.217 --> 24:13.050
- [sighs]

24:13.052 --> 24:15.719
Why I don't remember.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.823
It's starting
to slip away from me.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.724
I...

24:20.726 --> 24:22.726
- Well, tell me
what you do remember.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.698
- [exhales deeply]

24:27.700 --> 24:30.534
Well, I remember
a party on a beach.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.473
I remember a bonfire.

24:38.743 --> 24:41.812
I remember...
All the kids were in the water,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.814
And gabriel was in the water.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.251
Yeah, I thought he--

24:47.253 --> 24:48.853
He's gonna be cold
when he gets out,

24:48.855 --> 24:51.922
So I went to get
a blanket from the house.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.561
Cole was watching him.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.699
And by the time I got back,

25:01.701 --> 25:04.034
They were pulling him
out of the water.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.707
I--I knew exactly what to do.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.209
I--I pumped his chest.

25:15.046 --> 25:18.549
He...He spit out so much water.

25:22.754 --> 25:25.923
And then he--he sat up
and he hugged me.

25:31.029 --> 25:36.000
I just...Wanted to get him
away from there.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.601
Away from everyone else.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.270
Calm him down.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.710
But while I was
carrying him back...

25:48.280 --> 25:49.947
He wet himself.

25:52.684 --> 25:55.619
First time in years.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.555
And I thought about
calling you.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.024
I did, but...

26:00.026 --> 26:01.892
It was your
granddaughter's wedding

26:01.894 --> 26:04.562
And I didn't want
to interrupt you.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.299
And he just...

26:11.570 --> 26:14.305
He seemed so tired.

26:14.307 --> 26:17.274
He was falling asleep
on my shoulder.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.779
And I just...

26:21.781 --> 26:23.981
I thought...

26:23.983 --> 26:25.649
He's just had such a long day.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.918
I'll let him sleep.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.255
And then if he is feeling bad
the next morning,

26:31.257 --> 26:32.723
I'll take him to the...

26:34.659 --> 26:37.995
So I gave him a bath
and I--I put him to bed.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.665
Put him to bed.

26:43.969 --> 26:47.338
I--I put him to sleep.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.206
And then...
Oh, god.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.609
[sobbing]
- alison...

26:51.611 --> 26:54.078
Alison, listen to me.
- Why did I put him to sleep?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.879
- This wasn't your fault.

26:55.881 --> 26:57.715
There's no way
you could've known.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.216
- Ali, just take him
to the hospital.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.085
Please, just take him
to the hospital.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.254
- These cases are so rare,
they're impossible to catch.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.691
- Just let me take him
back to the hospital, please.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.360
- All right.
Easy, now.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.629
- [sobbing]

27:11.631 --> 27:14.231
I'll be better next time.
Please just let me--

27:14.233 --> 27:16.734
- Easy.

27:16.736 --> 27:17.968
- [sobbing]

27:17.970 --> 27:20.270
- Come on, breathe.
- I can't.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.273
- Breathe.
Just breathe.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.275
- [gasping]
- that's good.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.211
That's good.

27:35.387 --> 27:40.391
Alison, I am gonna
keep saying this...

27:40.393 --> 27:42.860
Until you hear it.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.195
It wasn't your fault.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.266
This is why secondary drowning
is so dangerous,

27:49.268 --> 27:50.868
Especially in young children,

27:50.870 --> 27:54.171
Because it just
looks like they're tired,

27:54.173 --> 27:57.875
Just like any kid
who spent the day at the beach.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.678
There's no way
you could've known.

28:09.154 --> 28:12.022
- But if I had taken him
to the hospital

28:12.024 --> 28:14.458
Right away...

28:14.460 --> 28:16.827
If I hadn't let him sleep...

28:18.430 --> 28:20.698
Would he be alive now?

28:24.369 --> 28:26.770
- I don't know.

28:35.113 --> 28:38.415
- Do you believe in heaven,
dr. Henry?

28:41.386 --> 28:43.387
- No, I don't.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.791
- So I'll never see him again.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.227
- It--it doesn't matter
what I believe.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.396
What do you believe, alison?

28:54.999 --> 28:58.035
- I believe in hell.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.914
[breathing hard]

29:59.297 --> 30:00.831
[gasps]
oh!

30:07.906 --> 30:09.473
Child's voice:
Where are you going?

30:13.411 --> 30:15.012
- [gasps]

30:15.014 --> 30:16.213
- Come back!

30:19.350 --> 30:22.052
- [panting]

30:22.054 --> 30:23.821
- Where are you going?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.361
- You'll freeze out there!

30:51.182 --> 30:53.584
- [shivering]

31:39.664 --> 31:41.064
Thank you.

31:59.550 --> 32:02.653
[hinges creaking]
- hey.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.589
When did you get back?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.391
- This morning.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.692
- How's athena?

32:08.694 --> 32:11.662
- I'm going back there
for a while.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.497
- Why?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.534
I don't understand, ali.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.003
I thought things were getting
better between the two of us.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.672
- You have to talk
to your mother.

32:21.674 --> 32:23.707
She's got something to tell you
about the ranch.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.610
- What?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.011
- [sighs]

32:28.013 --> 32:30.314
It's worthless.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.182
She's been refinancing it
all these years

32:32.184 --> 32:34.284
Just to pay the mortgage
and the operating expenses.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.687
- Bullshit. You can't
mortgage away $30 million.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.388
- Apparently, you can.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.093
- Why are you telling me this?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.329
- Because it's true.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.730
- [exhales]

32:46.732 --> 32:48.498
Please stay.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.369
- I love you...

32:54.038 --> 32:57.507
But I'll die
if I stay any longer.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.276
I don't want to die.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.207
- Ali!

33:30.209 --> 33:31.375
Ali, wait.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.609
Wait. Wait.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.149
You were right.

33:41.152 --> 33:44.354
About the mortgage.
You were right.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.257
So I'm ready now.
Let's...

33:47.259 --> 33:50.093
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.462
I don't care where we go.
Whatever you want.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.705
- Mr. Solloway,

34:01.707 --> 34:03.540
Thank you for coming back in.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.809
- What's this about?
- Have a seat.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.644
- How long is it gonna take,
man?

34:07.646 --> 34:10.147
I've got tickets to the yankees
game tonight with my son.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.416
- I'll make it quick.
I've got custody of my girls

34:12.418 --> 34:14.151
This weekend myself, so...

34:14.153 --> 34:16.787
- Your girls?
- My twins.

34:16.789 --> 34:19.289
- I thought you said
you had boys.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.592
- Did I?
- Are you fucking with me, man?

34:24.395 --> 34:27.464
- I'd like to ask you
a few questions about your car.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.132
- What?
- The car you drive.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.068
How long have you had it?

34:31.070 --> 34:32.402
- A few years.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.405
- What kind of mileage
does it get?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.340
- I don't know, pretty good.
Why?

34:37.342 --> 34:39.843
- What would you say
the turning radius is?

34:39.845 --> 34:41.411
- I have no idea.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.280
What does it matter?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.182
- Scott lockhart
was hit by a car, right?

34:45.184 --> 34:47.517
So...It matters.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.290
[heavy breathing]

35:00.331 --> 35:02.499
- What's wrong?

35:02.501 --> 35:04.301
- I want to do something
you've never done

35:04.303 --> 35:06.837
With anyone else before.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.739
- Anything you want.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.475
I'm yours.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.844
- What?
- I'm yours.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.712
- Say that again.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.348
- I'm yours.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.318
- Say it again.
- I'm yours.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.653
- And again.
- I'm yours.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.188
I'm yours.

35:25.190 --> 35:28.325
[both moaning]

35:28.327 --> 35:29.526
I'm yours.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.752
- Where did I find you?

35:55.754 --> 35:57.154
- I found you.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.170
I've never done that before.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.638
- No?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
- Have you?

36:16.642 --> 36:19.576
- Yeah.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.478
- Next time.

36:28.419 --> 36:31.454
I have to go soon.
Do you mind if I take a shower?

36:31.456 --> 36:33.857
- Sure.
It's just there.

36:44.302 --> 36:47.337
[water running]

37:22.373 --> 37:24.541
- Hey, you ran off with my top.

37:25.610 --> 37:26.977
- What?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.612
- Well, my--
my jeans were under the bed,

37:28.614 --> 37:30.347
But I--I can't find it anywhere.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.782
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.984
- [sighs]

37:33.986 --> 37:35.885
It must be
in the washing machine.

37:35.887 --> 37:39.256
- Is it wet already?
- Yeah.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.024
- I have to go.
What am I gonna wear?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.726
- I don't know.
Something of helen's.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.361
- Well, won't she miss it?

37:44.363 --> 37:45.562
- Fuck!

37:54.605 --> 37:56.673
- Is this weird?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.475
This is kind of weird.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.343
- Yeah, it's weird.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.412
- It's a beautiful shirt.

38:11.355 --> 38:13.890
Are you freaking out right now?
- A little bit.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.027
- Do not freak out.
It's gonna be okay.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.562
- How?
- I don't know.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.498
You'll figure it out.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.700
I have faith in you,
noah solloway.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.072
- Here's your shirt.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.675
Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.510
- Come on,
I'll walk you to the station.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.378
- No, it's okay.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.847
I don't want to
bump into anyone you know.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.785
- When are we gonna
see each other again?

38:41.787 --> 38:43.053
- Soon.

38:50.661 --> 38:54.397
- I love you.
You know that, don't you?

38:54.399 --> 38:55.799
- Yeah.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.801
I do.

39:20.758 --> 39:22.425
[door closing]

39:22.427 --> 39:24.394
- Dad?
We're home!

39:27.698 --> 39:30.033
- I'm just worried
she's in for a rude awakening.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.968
- It's--it's soft tacos?

39:31.970 --> 39:35.105
I want hard tacos.
- Tough life.

39:35.107 --> 39:37.607
- You were right.
It's soft.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.442
- She thinks she can
get into williams

39:39.444 --> 39:41.111
Because she's a legacy,
but with her grades,

39:41.113 --> 39:44.047
We really would've
had to donate, like, a library.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.384
- Helen--
- mommy, where's my blue cup?

39:47.386 --> 39:48.852
- Um, did you check
the dishwasher?

39:48.854 --> 39:50.587
And where's martin?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.589
He's supposed to be
setting the table right now.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.557
- He's washing dishes tonight.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.128
Mommy, can I peel the garlic?

39:58.130 --> 39:59.729
- Yes, that would be
very helpful.

39:59.731 --> 40:00.930
Thank you.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.603
Have you been using my shampoo?

40:06.605 --> 40:09.005
- What?
- It's okay if you have.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.108
It's just...Kind of expensive,
and you don't have much hair.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.484
- Are you gonna tell me?

40:21.486 --> 40:23.753
- Tell you what?
- About the test.

40:23.755 --> 40:24.754
- What test?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.956
- I found it in the garbage.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.792
- Yeah, I don't know
what test you're talking about.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.628
- Helen, don't do this.
- Don't do what?

40:31.630 --> 40:32.962
- You're pregnant.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.164
- What?

40:34.166 --> 40:35.832
- I found your pregnancy test.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.634
- You found a pregnancy test?
- Yes.

40:37.636 --> 40:38.968
In the garbage.
- Which garbage?

40:38.970 --> 40:41.104
- The one in the kitchen.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.440
- Do you have it?
Can I see it?

40:47.545 --> 40:49.712
You found this in our garbage?
- Yes.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.783
- Well, noah,
it's not mine.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.185
- What?

40:55.187 --> 40:57.821
- It must be whitney's.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.522
- No.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.191
- Well, it's certainly
not stacey's.

41:01.193 --> 41:04.194
- It's not yours?
- No!

41:04.196 --> 41:06.729
- Jesus christ.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.932
- Fuck.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.733
Fuck.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.802
- Well, it's a good thing
we send her to therapy.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.839
- Noah, can you not do that?

41:15.841 --> 41:18.007
- [whispers] oh, fuck.

41:19.577 --> 41:20.810
- [knocking]

41:27.485 --> 41:28.751
- Uh-oh.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.893
- Honey, we're not angry.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.028
- What?
- You just have to talk to us.

41:39.030 --> 41:43.733
I mean, this is not something
you can handle on your own.

41:43.735 --> 41:46.102
- We're not angry with you.
- Stop saying that.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.644
- What is that?
- Whitney.

41:56.113 --> 41:57.914
We know you're pregnant.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.652
- Yeah, okay.
Whatever.

42:02.654 --> 42:04.754
- Okay, let me have that.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.589
- No! No, no, no!
- Give it to me.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.124
- Okay, I am!
I am.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.666
I'm sorry.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.871
I'm so stupid.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.807
And I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

42:24.809 --> 42:29.279
I'm gonna get you through this.
Everything is going to be okay.

42:29.281 --> 42:31.748
- I already have it
taken care of.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.250
I have an abortion
set up for tomorrow.

42:36.787 --> 42:39.155
- Who did this to you?

42:39.157 --> 42:42.025
- No one did it to me.
I wasn't raped.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.893
- Who's the boy?

42:43.895 --> 42:45.161
- No one.
Who cares?

42:45.163 --> 42:46.829
- I care!
- Shh.

42:46.831 --> 42:48.698
Gi--give us a minute, okay?

42:51.569 --> 42:52.835
- Fine.

42:59.777 --> 43:03.646
[keys clacking]

43:03.648 --> 43:04.814
[door opens]

43:04.816 --> 43:07.116
- I think she's relieved...

43:07.118 --> 43:08.318
Honestly.

43:10.187 --> 43:12.255
That we know.

43:14.992 --> 43:16.993
I'll take her
into dr. Jaffey's office

43:16.995 --> 43:19.028
And she can do the d&c there.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.867
- How pregnant is she?

43:24.869 --> 43:26.202
- Almost three months.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.871
- Three months?

43:28.873 --> 43:31.240
How did we miss that?

43:31.242 --> 43:33.776
- I don't know.

43:37.147 --> 43:39.649
We have to do better.

43:41.885 --> 43:43.186
- I know.

43:49.026 --> 43:51.027
Who's the boy?

43:51.029 --> 43:52.762
- She won't say.

43:52.764 --> 43:54.964
- Why not?
- I don't know.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.866
I don't know,
there's this senior that's been

43:56.868 --> 43:59.035
Posting all the time
on her facebook page,

43:59.037 --> 44:01.037
Jack...Ming lee.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.839
I think maybe it's him?

44:02.841 --> 44:05.742
- You check her facebook page?
- Yeah, of course I do.

44:05.744 --> 44:08.244
- Do you know the password?
- No.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.712
We're friends.

44:17.254 --> 44:20.023
- She was gonna
go to planned parenthood.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.257
- Alone?

44:21.259 --> 44:23.026
- That's what she says.

44:23.028 --> 44:24.394
I bet he's gonna
be there, though.

44:24.396 --> 44:25.995
- Which planned parenthood?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.264
- [sighs]
the one on wall street.

44:28.266 --> 44:30.166
She's very proud
she made an appointment

44:30.168 --> 44:31.401
At the best one in the city.

44:35.072 --> 44:36.673
- [sighs]

44:38.208 --> 44:40.276
- Oh, my god.

44:40.278 --> 44:42.078
My baby is pregnant.

44:45.949 --> 44:47.150
- Helen...

44:51.221 --> 44:52.889
This isn't your fault.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.096
- I know.

45:28.192 --> 45:30.393
- Hi.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.395
- Do you have an appointment?

45:32.397 --> 45:34.997
- Uh, no.
My daughter does.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.365
- Where is she?

45:36.367 --> 45:39.202
- She's, uh...
We're meeting here.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.104
I can't remember
what time the appointment was.

45:41.106 --> 45:42.505
It's whitney solloway.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.240
- I can't give you
any of that information.

45:44.242 --> 45:47.110
Why don't you send her a text?

45:47.112 --> 45:48.945
- I can't.
I took away her phone.

45:53.383 --> 45:54.784
Can I sit here?

46:18.308 --> 46:19.976
- Hey, uh...

46:19.978 --> 46:21.410
- Hi.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.012
She's 17, you--
- hey, hey--

46:23.014 --> 46:24.413
We're friends, okay?
- Fuck you!

46:24.415 --> 46:26.282
She's fucking 17!
[overlapping shouting]

46:26.284 --> 46:28.117
