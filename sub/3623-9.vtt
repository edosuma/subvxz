outside today.

00:10.777 --> 00:15.214
Uh, Mr. B., yeah, I think
that request was last week,

00:15.216 --> 00:17.783
you know, when it was <i>nice</i> out.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.218
Do you have any idea

00:19.220 --> 00:22.755
the bureaucratic
nightmare entailed

00:22.757 --> 00:24.156
in having class outside?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.158
Feel lucky
we're doing it at all!

Heh. I was, uh...

01:11.305 --> 01:13.238
I... I was working
on another project.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.840
D-did you
start yours, K.P.?

01:14.842 --> 01:17.242
Um, Ron?
I finished it.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.042
3 1/2 weeks ago.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.945
Oh, man, I don't even
have a topic.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.082
Well, it's supposed
to be autobiographical.

01:23.084 --> 01:23.882
Yeah, I know,

01:23.884 --> 01:25.382
I kept waiting for it
to write itself.

01:25.384 --> 01:26.151
That's not what
the auto...

well, never mind.

I'll write about
our first mission!

onto something, and, yeah,

04:52.059 --> 04:53.125
it kind of snapped off.

control unit,

conditions is not relevant!

too frequently,
