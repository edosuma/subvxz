WEBVTT

00:00.101 --> 00:03.070
Tell me how you killed the Fatman and why.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.773
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:06.841 --> 00:09.173
<i>Magnum, everybody knows
it's a murder.</i>

00:09.243 --> 00:11.370
Jean Claude Fornier
was poisoned.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.434
Poisoned?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.276
Strychnine
in his French onion soup.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.543
You dirty rat.
I'm gonna rub you out.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.642
<i>I'm afraid you got
the wrong hombre, pilgrim.</i>

00:18.719 --> 00:19.879
How did you know
it was a murder?

00:19.954 --> 00:21.353
Luther Gillis works alone.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.751
Duck!

02:03.407 --> 02:04.396
What's the deal?

02:04.475 --> 02:05.737
No deal.

02:06.610 --> 02:09.169
Tell me how you killed the Fatman and why.

02:09.246 --> 02:10.508
Maybe I can
talk to the Lieutenant

02:10.580 --> 02:12.606
about a few weeks off
for good behavior.

02:12.683 --> 02:14.344
I'm not going in.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.946
<i>Why, Wilmer?</i>

02:19.256 --> 02:21.019
You said you were coming alone.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.286
I lied.

02:22.927 --> 02:24.895
Who else knows about the Fatman?

02:24.962 --> 02:27.021
<i>Now, if I told you that,</i>

02:27.932 --> 02:30.366
you'd have your goons shoot me.

02:36.674 --> 02:39.302
Care for a cigarette?
The names...

02:39.910 --> 02:41.468
<i>Say, Goliath,</i>

02:41.979 --> 02:44.777
<i>you don't happen to
have a match, do you?</i>

02:58.596 --> 03:00.086
<i>Come on, Wilmer.</i>

03:03.200 --> 03:05.634
You killed 'em.
You killed 'em.

03:12.877 --> 03:14.936
We got here as fast as we could.

03:15.012 --> 03:16.138
<i>You all right, Magnum?</i>

03:16.213 --> 03:17.771
<i>Take him away, boys, murder one.</i>

03:17.848 --> 03:21.079
<i>Oh, and you better call the
coroner for the other two.</i>

03:25.389 --> 03:27.380
<i>It's all over, Inspector.</i>

03:32.096 --> 03:34.360
Looks like you wrapped up
another one for us.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.126
Got a match?

03:52.249 --> 03:53.273
<i>Oh, hi, boss.</i>

03:53.350 --> 03:55.375
<i>You still here, Precious?</i>

03:55.619 --> 03:58.884
<i>Yeah, I'm just trying to
decide what bills to pay.</i>

04:01.225 --> 04:04.388
<i>Oh, by the way,
you have a late caller.</i>

04:08.299 --> 04:10.199
The Fatman's widow.

04:10.534 --> 04:13.435
You forgot to tell me
she's such a looker.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.440
<i>Lock the door behind you on
your way out, will you, Precious?</i>

04:25.449 --> 04:26.882
<i>Hello, Angel.</i>

04:27.585 --> 04:29.018
<i>Out a little late, aren't you?</i>

04:30.788 --> 04:32.688
I heard you got Wilmer.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.424
I don't know
how I'll ever repay you.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.323
Cash would be fine.

04:37.394 --> 04:39.328
But you don't understand.

04:39.396 --> 04:42.991
<i>I mean, I don't know how I'll
ever be able to repay you.</i>

04:43.167 --> 04:46.227
<i>You see, the Fatman,
he left me completely broke.</i>

04:46.303 --> 04:48.271
I don't have a dime to my name.

04:48.339 --> 04:49.966
<i>Oh, Angel,
that's not what you told me</i>

04:50.040 --> 04:52.474
when you walked in here
three days ago.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.908
I lied.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.206
I've got something else for you.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.305
Something better than money.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.044
<i>Not tonight, Angel,
I have a headache.</i>

05:12.129 --> 05:14.063
What is it? It's heavy.

05:14.131 --> 05:16.395
The stuff dreams are made of.

05:28.779 --> 05:30.212
<i>Like any of us,</i>

05:30.281 --> 05:32.909
<i>Thomas Magnum
has his ups and downs.</i>

05:33.617 --> 05:35.949
<i>Kind of goes with the territory.</i>

05:36.287 --> 05:38.949
<i>I mean, hey,
none of us are perfect.</i>

05:39.323 --> 05:41.018
<i>Not even me.</i>

05:41.091 --> 05:42.854
<i>But you can be sure
of one thing,</i>

05:42.926 --> 05:46.418
<i>every time I came
to Bananaland on a case,</i>

05:46.497 --> 05:48.988
<i>he was always there
to back me up,</i>

05:49.066 --> 05:53.230
<i>to do the little things that don't
always show up in the box score.</i>

05:53.470 --> 05:56.735
<i>Providing me with the back-up
and the legwork</i>

05:57.441 --> 06:00.376
<i>that enabled me
to crack three major cases.</i>

06:03.347 --> 06:05.144
<i>Speaking of the word "cracked",</i>

06:05.215 --> 06:09.311
<i>it reminds me of a time my little
brother thought he was a chicken.</i>

06:09.486 --> 06:11.784
<i>We should have took him
to the doctor for a cure,</i>

06:12.056 --> 06:14.081
<i>but we needed the eggs.</i>

06:20.464 --> 06:22.762
<i>Well, enough of the frivolity.</i>

06:24.435 --> 06:27.097
<i>So, in conclusion,
I just wanna say</i>

06:27.571 --> 06:31.598
<i>that I'm very proud
to be here today</i>

06:31.942 --> 06:35.742
<i>and be one of the Joes
that's taking part in honoring</i>

06:35.979 --> 06:41.042
<i>our pal, Tom Magnum, as Local
Private Investigator of the Year.</i>

06:41.585 --> 06:43.109
<i>And I hope to say</i>

06:43.187 --> 06:46.816
<i>that maybe next year he'll get
lucky and win the real award.</i>

06:46.890 --> 06:48.585
<i>The national one.</i>

06:49.827 --> 06:53.263
<i>Well, thanks again, and I just
wanna turn the festivities back</i>

06:53.697 --> 06:57.633
<i>to that super flash of a P.I.,
Richard Lindley, our Pres.</i>

07:01.672 --> 07:02.866
How'd I do?

07:02.940 --> 07:04.134
<i>You were wonderful, Luther.</i>

07:04.208 --> 07:05.573
<i>I thought so.
Great joke, huh?</i>

07:05.642 --> 07:07.371
<i>Thank you,
Mr. Gillis.</i>

07:07.444 --> 07:09.469
<i>It's always a pleasure</i>

07:09.546 --> 07:12.674
<i>to hear from one of the
pioneers in the field.</i>

07:13.984 --> 07:17.010
<i>Now I would like to
bring to the podium</i>

07:17.921 --> 07:20.185
<i>not a private investigator,</i>

07:20.657 --> 07:25.720
<i>but nonetheless, a gentleman who
is as expert at law enforcement</i>

07:25.929 --> 07:28.921
<i>as anyone who is attending
this convention.</i>

07:29.133 --> 07:32.967
<i>The man who
almost single-handedly</i>

07:33.437 --> 07:35.928
<i>crippled the drug dealers
in Southern France</i>

07:36.006 --> 07:38.406
<i>and their leader, Marcel Dubray.</i>

07:38.475 --> 07:42.036
<i>A man whose methods
may not be sanctioned</i>

07:42.112 --> 07:45.843
<i>by the Supreme Court
or the World Court,</i>

07:46.183 --> 07:48.617
<i>but so far they have
the good sense</i>

07:48.685 --> 07:52.815
<i>to let him keep on doing what
he does best to the criminals,</i>

07:52.890 --> 07:55.051
<i>and that's arresting them.</i>

07:55.926 --> 07:57.860
<i>So, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

07:57.928 --> 08:02.262
<i>I give you
Inspector Jean Claude Fornier</i>

08:02.900 --> 08:05.528
<i>of the
Marseilles Police Department.</i>

08:13.677 --> 08:15.406
<i>Merci. Thank you.</i>

08:15.479 --> 08:18.414
<i>You're all too kind.
Much too kind.</i>

08:18.549 --> 08:20.039
<i>For your accolades</i>

08:20.117 --> 08:23.450
<i>should be reserved to the
gentleman seated here on the dais,</i>

08:23.520 --> 08:26.683
<i>the great private
investigator, Thomas Magnum.</i>

08:27.558 --> 08:30.049
<i>I only did work
with him briefly,</i>

08:30.127 --> 08:32.186
<i>but in that very short time,</i>

08:32.261 --> 08:34.856
<i>I learned
much of his many talents,</i>

08:36.900 --> 08:41.360
<i>his bravery,
his unique singing ability,</i>

08:41.804 --> 08:46.174
<i>and his unique friends.</i>

08:49.480 --> 08:53.007
<i>It gives me pleasure
to present this award,</i>

08:53.383 --> 08:58.320
<i>for without the incredible efforts
of this great private investigator,</i>

08:58.589 --> 09:00.716
<i>I would be dead today.</i>

09:10.434 --> 09:12.402
No!

09:12.469 --> 09:14.232
No! Jean Claude!

09:14.738 --> 09:16.228
Jean Claude?

09:22.212 --> 09:23.543
Thomas.

09:30.721 --> 09:32.621
<i>Oh, gee, he croaked.</i>

09:37.294 --> 09:39.558
<i>Thomas, I just can't believe it.</i>

09:39.830 --> 09:42.094
<i>It just doesn't
make any sense, does it?</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:45.100
<i>He was such a charming,
vibrant man.</i>

09:45.369 --> 09:48.133
I remember the time he was shot

09:48.839 --> 09:52.935
<i>and I came over and I brought him
some Chinese take-out, you know.</i>

09:53.277 --> 09:55.905
And then you came in
and you were jealous.

09:55.979 --> 09:57.810
I wasn't jealous.

09:57.881 --> 09:59.473
That's not what you told me.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.608
Yeah. You said that...

10:00.684 --> 10:03.244
I said Jean Claude was
a great guy.

10:07.324 --> 10:09.019
<i>Now, we've still got the room
you guys gave me...</i>

10:09.092 --> 10:11.526
<i>There goes our party
right out the window,</i>

10:11.595 --> 10:13.722
right along with your award.

10:13.797 --> 10:15.094
<i>But there'll be
other awards, T.M.</i>

10:15.165 --> 10:18.134
<i>Now, wait a minute. Wait
just a minute. I'm shocked.</i>

10:18.201 --> 10:19.600
<i>No, no, I'm more than shocked.</i>

10:19.670 --> 10:22.332
<i>I'm hurt that you guys
would think for one minute,</i>

10:22.406 --> 10:25.000
<i>one tiny little second,</i>

10:25.075 --> 10:28.567
<i>that this silly,
unimportant little trinket</i>

10:28.645 --> 10:30.010
could have any meaning to me

10:30.080 --> 10:31.911
when put up against
the death of a human being.

10:31.982 --> 10:33.540
Who you didn't like.

10:33.617 --> 10:35.642
What's that got to do
with anything?

10:35.719 --> 10:38.415
We're talking about
a human life here.

10:38.789 --> 10:41.280
<i>Oh, Thomas, that's so beautiful.</i>

10:42.025 --> 10:45.256
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.
Hey, I misjudged you, T.M.</i>

10:45.329 --> 10:46.626
<i>I mean, I know how much
you were counting on</i>

10:46.697 --> 10:48.255
having that thing
on your mantle and I...

10:48.332 --> 10:50.357
I wasn't counting on anything.

10:50.434 --> 10:53.164
<i>I mean, yes, I was flattered,
okay, I was proud.</i>

10:53.236 --> 10:54.601
But so what?

10:54.671 --> 10:57.504
<i>I mean, what really matters
is a friend,</i>

10:58.141 --> 11:01.338
a member of the profession
has crossed the river.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.072
<i>That's what counts.
Not this, this...</i>

11:03.146 --> 11:04.579
Award?

11:06.950 --> 11:08.815
<i>You're upset, Carol.</i>

11:09.319 --> 11:12.311
We've still got the room.
You go upstairs and rest.

11:12.389 --> 11:14.482
Nobody goes anywhere.

11:15.792 --> 11:18.727
<i>Gentlemen.
Carol, my condolences.</i>

11:20.731 --> 11:22.028
What are you doing here?

11:22.099 --> 11:24.090
Investigating a murder.

11:24.668 --> 11:26.431
I'm not investigating a murder.

11:26.503 --> 11:28.027
You're going to a funeral.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.074
I'm going to Detroit
on vacation.

11:32.476 --> 11:34.876
Jean Claude Fornier
was poisoned.

11:35.178 --> 11:37.908
<i>Oh, my God. Poisoned? How?</i>

11:38.382 --> 11:39.406
<i>According to forensics,</i>

11:39.483 --> 11:42.543
with about enough strychnine
in his French onion soup

11:42.619 --> 11:45.588
to wipe out half of the
rat population of Waimanalo.

11:45.656 --> 11:48.147
Which means someone at the
convention must have done it.

11:48.225 --> 11:49.249
You got any leads?

11:49.326 --> 11:51.385
<i>Oh, no, you don't.
This is not my case.</i>

11:51.461 --> 11:54.294
The only reason I came
down here before I left

11:54.364 --> 11:57.492
is to order everyone to
stay exactly where they are.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.398
No one leaves town.

11:59.903 --> 12:03.600
<i>Bad luck about the award, Magnum.
I know you were counting on it.</i>

12:03.674 --> 12:06.302
<i>If you're going on vacation,
who's handling the case?</i>

12:20.590 --> 12:21.784
Luther.

12:22.092 --> 12:23.855
<i>Right again, big guy.</i>

12:23.927 --> 12:26.259
No wonder they gave you
the old Poop 'n' Snoop Award.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.387
Better luck next time.

12:27.464 --> 12:29.056
What are you doing here?
Nothing.

12:29.132 --> 12:32.124
<i>You're investigating
the murder, aren't you?</i>

12:32.202 --> 12:33.567
You are.

12:35.105 --> 12:36.504
How did you know
it was a murder?

12:36.573 --> 12:39.167
Everybody knows
Jean Claude was quaffed.

12:39.242 --> 12:40.504
It's all over the hotel.

12:40.577 --> 12:42.568
<i>You're looking for
some of the action, too, huh?</i>

12:42.646 --> 12:45.513
<i>Forget about it, pal.
Luther Gillis works alone.</i>

12:45.582 --> 12:47.072
<i>I don't want to
work with you, Luther.</i>

12:47.150 --> 12:48.640
<i>Don't beg, Tom,
please don't beg.</i>

12:48.719 --> 12:50.414
You stay out of my way.
Do you understand?

12:50.487 --> 12:51.579
<i>Oh, yeah?
Yeah.</i>

12:51.655 --> 12:53.714
<i>Hey, hold it, gentlemen.</i>

12:54.224 --> 12:57.091
Ray Lemon.
Hotel Security.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.393
What are you two
doing up on this floor?

12:59.463 --> 13:00.930
Looking for the ice machine.
Luther...

13:00.997 --> 13:03.397
I need some ice. I need
a drink. I need a drink.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.196
<i>Sorry, I got to
get my friend to his room.</i>

13:05.268 --> 13:07.099
<i>You know, get him some coffee.
You know what I mean?</i>

13:07.170 --> 13:08.831
<i>Yeah, you guys
wouldn't be so ambitious</i>

13:08.905 --> 13:10.964
<i>as to try and con me
now, would you?</i>

13:11.041 --> 13:13.271
<i>I mean, you're only about
the 10th and 11th P.I.'s</i>

13:13.343 --> 13:15.743
I've caught skulking around
looking for a clue.

13:15.812 --> 13:17.074
Really?

13:17.147 --> 13:18.478
Really.

13:18.615 --> 13:20.242
Thomas Magnum?

13:22.219 --> 13:24.187
You're the guy they're
throwing the shindig for?

13:24.254 --> 13:25.414
<i>Well, yeah, yes, I am.</i>

13:25.489 --> 13:28.117
<i>That's in the old dumper now,
isn't it?</i>

13:28.191 --> 13:30.125
<i>Well, it's unimportant,
really, Mr. Lemon.</i>

13:30.193 --> 13:32.753
<i>Well, let me
give you guys a little clue.</i>

13:32.829 --> 13:34.694
The police are guarding
the victim's room.

13:34.765 --> 13:37.359
<i>So go play Sam Spade in
somebody else's hotel, will you?</i>

13:37.434 --> 13:39.061
<i>Hey, sure.
No problem.</i>

13:39.136 --> 13:40.660
We'll stay out of the way.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.671
<i>Oh, listen, by the way,
I haven't heard.</i>

13:42.739 --> 13:45.936
Who's the police detective
assigned to this case?

13:46.309 --> 13:48.209
<i>John Wayne.</i>

13:51.181 --> 13:53.672
Never a lawman
when you need one.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.417
That rookie better show up soon

13:55.485 --> 13:58.215
<i>or I'll have him pounding a
beat in a cane field, by golly.</i>

13:58.288 --> 14:02.122
<i>Oh, yeah? He'll have to
step over me first. See.</i>

14:02.192 --> 14:04.057
What?
What are you talking about?

14:04.127 --> 14:05.754
I'm doing
Edward G. Robinson.

14:05.829 --> 14:07.820
See? See?
I'll get you for that. See?

14:08.198 --> 14:10.359
<i>You know?
Uh, no, I don't know.</i>

14:10.433 --> 14:13.061
<i>You don't know? What do
you mean, you don't know?</i>

14:13.136 --> 14:16.537
Everyone who's anyone has
heard of Edward G. Robinson.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.109
How about Cagney?

14:22.179 --> 14:24.807
You dirty rat.
I'm gonna rub you out.

14:25.515 --> 14:27.642
<i>Okay, now it's your turn.</i>

14:28.218 --> 14:32.712
<i>I'm afraid you got the wrong hombre,
pilgrim. I don't do impressions.</i>

14:35.292 --> 14:38.261
<i>Oh, yeah? Let's see if you
can figure this one out.</i>

14:38.328 --> 14:39.386
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

14:39.462 --> 14:43.831
<i>Lieutenant Gordon Katsumoto had
already searched Jean Claude's room</i>

14:43.900 --> 14:46.869
<i>and had probably impounded
anything that might resemble a clue.</i>

14:46.937 --> 14:50.634
<i>So why chance getting busted
by going over barren ground?</i>

14:50.707 --> 14:52.675
<i>Well, maybe because of something.</i>

14:52.742 --> 14:55.677
<i>Jean Claude had told me once
in confidence.</i>

14:55.745 --> 14:57.679
<i>Something about
a little black book</i>

14:57.747 --> 14:59.544
<i>that he hid
in a very special place</i>

14:59.616 --> 15:02.414
<i>whenever he felt
his life was in danger.</i>

15:04.187 --> 15:08.021
<i>And maybe remembering those little
details told to you over a beer</i>

15:08.091 --> 15:11.686
<i>is what makes the difference between
an award-winning private investigator</i>

15:11.761 --> 15:14.161
<i>and your
run-of-the-mill gumshoe.</i>

15:14.998 --> 15:16.625
<i>Freeze, Magnum.</i>

15:21.271 --> 15:23.603
Let me count the felonies.

15:30.746 --> 15:33.078
<i>Put it down, Tracy.</i>

15:33.416 --> 15:36.010
You better tell me
what you're doing here.

15:36.085 --> 15:37.848
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>

15:37.920 --> 15:40.354
<i>You ain't heard
nothing yet, folks.</i>

15:40.756 --> 15:45.716
<i>No. I think you better tell me
what you're doing here, Tracy.</i>

15:45.795 --> 15:48.263
<i>Now, I know you're not
a meter maid anymore,</i>

15:48.330 --> 15:51.424
<i>but I don't think patrolmen,
patrolwomen,</i>

15:52.101 --> 15:55.696
are supposed to be lurking around
murder sites out of uniform.

15:55.771 --> 15:58.501
Especially with Homicide
right outside the door.

15:58.574 --> 15:59.734
I know that.

16:01.477 --> 16:03.104
How did you get on
Jean Claude's balcony?

16:03.179 --> 16:05.443
Or should I ask
Lieutenant Katsumoto?

16:05.514 --> 16:07.072
No!

16:07.183 --> 16:08.878
<i>Guys, it's Dirty Harry.</i>

16:08.984 --> 16:10.008
Dirty who?

16:10.086 --> 16:12.418
<i>Talk to me, Tracy. Dirty who?
What's the matter with you?</i>

16:12.488 --> 16:14.786
Softly.
Dirty Harry. You know?

16:14.857 --> 16:18.156
<i>Okay. I'm no longer a cop.
"Go ahead, make my day."</i>

16:19.595 --> 16:21.187
Why?
I got fired.

16:23.499 --> 16:25.467
<i>Why?
Oh, it's really not important.</i>

16:25.534 --> 16:26.694
<i>Well, how about,</i>

16:27.570 --> 16:29.094
<i>"What's up, Doc?"</i>

16:29.171 --> 16:31.071
"You wascally wabbit..."

16:31.140 --> 16:33.631
<i>"Don't get excited, Rick,
I'm just..."</i>

16:33.709 --> 16:35.506
<i>Inka dinka doo.</i>

16:35.578 --> 16:37.569
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>

16:37.646 --> 16:40.615
<i>Now, for the last time, Tracy,
what are you doing here?</i>

16:40.683 --> 16:43.117
I am trying to solve the murder.

16:43.853 --> 16:45.320
How'd you know it was a murder?

16:45.387 --> 16:47.981
<i>Magnum, everybody knows
it's a murder.</i>

16:49.024 --> 16:50.548
<i>What, are you freelancing?</i>

16:50.626 --> 16:52.253
Of course not.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.064
I'm a regular P.I. Now.
Just like you.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.365
In the employ of the Richard
Lindley Detective Agency.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.662
<i>The Richard Lindley, you know,</i>

17:02.738 --> 17:06.037
the President of the American
Association of Private Investigators.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.599
The guy who was in charge
of the ceremony for the award

17:10.412 --> 17:12.346
that you never got.

17:16.719 --> 17:18.242
Have you talked to Lindley?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.446
Yeah. About an hour ago.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.013
Did he say any...

17:22.090 --> 17:23.718
<i>The plane, the plane... What plane?</i>

17:23.792 --> 17:27.627
Were they talking about
rescheduling the award or anything?

17:27.797 --> 17:28.821
No.

17:29.498 --> 17:32.592
<i>Oh. Well, it's not important.</i>

17:33.903 --> 17:34.927
<i>Look, Mr. Gillis...</i>

17:35.004 --> 17:39.304
<i>So, what do you say, let's help each
other out and solve this grounder?</i>

17:39.708 --> 17:41.335
From the
greatest movie ever made.

17:41.410 --> 17:44.004
Just like old times.
Ready? Here goes.

17:44.079 --> 17:46.707
And this is your last chance.

17:46.782 --> 17:50.240
<i>Frankly, Inspector,
I don't give a damn.</i>

17:50.986 --> 17:54.615
<i>Look, it's been a pleasure
chatting with you, Mr. Gillis,</i>

17:54.690 --> 17:57.181
but I have to go inside
and call downtown.

17:57.259 --> 17:59.750
A uniformed policeman was
supposed to be here 15 minutes ago.

17:59.829 --> 18:00.887
<i>Uh, wait!
What?</i>

18:00.963 --> 18:02.590
<i>Uh, The Three Stooges!</i>

18:05.034 --> 18:06.729
<i>Look, pilgrim,
you take your hands away,</i>

18:06.802 --> 18:08.633
or you're facing
a one-way trip to Boot Hill.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.100
What was that?
The Three Stooges.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.300
That's it!

18:13.375 --> 18:16.139
Get out or I'll place you under
arrest for obstruction of justice.

18:16.212 --> 18:17.543
<i>Let's go.
Now, if you're not gone</i>

18:17.613 --> 18:19.240
<i>by the time
I finish my call, I'll...</i>

18:22.318 --> 18:23.979
<i>Hey, hey, are you all right?</i>

18:24.053 --> 18:25.987
<i>Oh, it's my ticker.</i>

18:26.055 --> 18:27.818
Get the paramedicals.

18:27.890 --> 18:30.791
<i>Oh, hang on, partner,
I'll be right back.</i>

18:31.894 --> 18:34.055
<i>Isn't this exciting?
No, it isn't.</i>

18:34.129 --> 18:38.498
<i>Tracy, you're a nice person,
but every time I'm around you,</i>

18:39.168 --> 18:41.796
things just seem to fall
apart. You know what I mean?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.237
<i>Oh, gee, Thomas,
why are you so upset?</i>

18:44.306 --> 18:45.773
I'm not upset!

18:45.841 --> 18:47.001
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

18:47.076 --> 18:48.600
<i>Okay, okay,</i>

18:49.545 --> 18:51.877
<i>if it makes you happy,
I'm upset.</i>

18:52.147 --> 18:53.637
I could tell.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.042
<i>Here, catch.</i>

19:01.390 --> 19:03.858
How do you get fired
by the police department

19:03.926 --> 19:06.156
and hired by someone
like Richard Lindley?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.196
<i>Well, that's a very long story.</i>

19:08.264 --> 19:09.663
<i>See, it all started...</i>

19:09.732 --> 19:12.724
<i>Never mind, Tracy.
I don't... Never mind.</i>

19:13.702 --> 19:16.728
<i>Here I come, get my leg.</i>

19:17.339 --> 19:18.772
I got it.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.538
Catch my...

19:25.381 --> 19:26.814
Whoa!

19:29.652 --> 19:30.778
Thank you.

19:33.289 --> 19:34.688
<i>Tracy,</i>

19:36.325 --> 19:38.589
<i>I can't stop you
from investigating,</i>

19:38.661 --> 19:41.721
but Jean Claude Fornier was
kind of a friend of mine.

19:41.797 --> 19:42.889
Really?
Really.

19:42.965 --> 19:45.866
So it's important to me that
I find out who his killer is

19:45.935 --> 19:47.800
without any interference.

19:47.870 --> 19:51.306
So I'm sure you'll understand
why I have to do this

19:53.475 --> 19:54.464
alone.

19:58.981 --> 20:01.313
Paramedics'll take another three
and a half minutes to get here.

20:01.383 --> 20:03.749
<i>Oh, great. All I need
is another stiff.</i>

20:03.819 --> 20:05.116
I gonna try some CPR.

20:05.187 --> 20:06.176
Okay.

20:06.722 --> 20:08.519
<i>I'm not that kind of boy, pal.</i>

20:08.590 --> 20:10.148
<i>But maybe
if you play your cards right,</i>

20:10.225 --> 20:13.092
I might let you take me to the
party at the hospitality suite.

20:13.162 --> 20:14.424
But... But you were just...

20:14.496 --> 20:16.396
Probably gas.

20:17.099 --> 20:19.465
<i>Thanks for everything, pal.
See you around.</i>

20:19.535 --> 20:21.560
See?

20:30.379 --> 20:33.109
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but this time you're wrong.</i>

20:33.182 --> 20:35.343
<i>Sure, it's a great feeling
to be the one guy</i>

20:35.417 --> 20:38.386
<i>who finally cracks
a major case all on his own.</i>

20:38.454 --> 20:40.649
<i>But I'm not really the kind of
private investigator</i>

20:40.723 --> 20:43.487
<i>who has to always work alone
and grab all the glory.</i>

20:43.559 --> 20:47.188
<i>I believe in teamwork and pulling
together to get the job done.</i>

20:47.262 --> 20:49.787
<i>And I'm not too proud to
ask for help when I need it.</i>

20:49.865 --> 20:53.699
<i>But when it comes to Tracy
Spencer and Luther H. Gillis,</i>

20:54.036 --> 20:55.401
<i>I'd rather do it myself.</i>

20:57.806 --> 20:59.603
Who is it?
Gillis.

21:06.648 --> 21:08.206
All right!

21:09.151 --> 21:11.119
<i>Boy, that just worked
like bear grease</i>

21:11.186 --> 21:14.849
on the lock of the ladies'
room at the Cleveland City Hall.

21:15.624 --> 21:19.185
Reminds me of a case I had
in Calumet City back in '66.

21:20.129 --> 21:22.029
It was a trucking company.

21:22.097 --> 21:26.158
They were using their rigs to transport
illegal cases of peanut butter.

21:26.235 --> 21:27.668
Illegal peanut butter?

21:27.736 --> 21:30.603
<i>Yeah, but that's not what
was really on the inside.</i>

21:30.672 --> 21:33.163
<i>But quit meandering, Magnum.</i>

21:33.242 --> 21:36.336
You got to live in the present.
The right here and the now.

21:36.412 --> 21:37.709
What did you find?

21:37.780 --> 21:38.940
I didn't find anything.

21:39.014 --> 21:42.211
What? What do you mean
you didn't find anything?

21:42.351 --> 21:44.410
After all I went through?

21:44.486 --> 21:46.078
And you inside there
dropping more stuff

21:46.155 --> 21:48.851
than DiMaggio did
in his entire career.

21:50.192 --> 21:51.989
<i>You wouldn't be holding
back on me, would you?</i>

21:52.061 --> 21:53.961
Me? Luther.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.622
All right. All right.

21:55.697 --> 21:58.063
The scrounges who killed
that frog are gonna pay.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.034
Even if I have to do it
without your help.

22:01.203 --> 22:03.034
I'll let you know
if I find anything.

22:03.105 --> 22:06.006
<i>Nice try, though.
And I'd watch the booze.</i>

22:06.075 --> 22:07.804
It ain't that bad.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.095
Magnum!

22:33.902 --> 22:35.164
Magnum!

22:38.507 --> 22:41.271
<i>It actually got worse.
Between Luther and Tracy,</i>

22:41.343 --> 22:44.471
<i>then Gordon wanting to know
what games Luther was playing,</i>

22:44.546 --> 22:46.537
<i>and finally, Ray Lemon,
the hotel dick,</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:48.606
<i>again warning me
to stay out of his way,</i>

22:48.684 --> 22:50.242
<i>there was more traffic
in my room</i>

22:50.319 --> 22:53.186
<i>than on Kuhio Avenue
on a Saturday night.</i>

22:55.357 --> 22:58.292
<i>But there was another reason
for leaving my hotel room.</i>

22:58.393 --> 22:59.690
<i>A better reason.</i>

22:59.761 --> 23:01.854
<i>It had to do with
comforting a friend.</i>

23:01.930 --> 23:05.696
<i>A friend who'd lost someone she'd
become seriously involved with.</i>

23:05.767 --> 23:07.132
<i>And that was
at least as important</i>

23:07.202 --> 23:11.070
<i>as finding out what clues Fornier's
little black book might hold.</i>

23:11.140 --> 23:12.801
<i>Oh, Thomas.</i>

23:15.744 --> 23:17.905
This was written last night.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.177
"For your accolades
should be reserved"

23:20.249 --> 23:23.218
"for the gentleman
seated here on the dais..."

23:24.653 --> 23:26.985
It was his presentation speech.

23:30.459 --> 23:33.656
He certainly did write a
lot of nice things about you.

23:33.729 --> 23:36.425
<i>Carol, I'm sorry if this
is too painful for you.</i>

23:36.498 --> 23:39.490
What was that reference
to your singing about?

23:40.736 --> 23:42.101
I think you better
let me see that.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.331
Wait! Listen.

23:43.405 --> 23:46.670
<i>"I know everything,
yet I know nothing.</i>

23:47.509 --> 23:51.309
<i>"And whether to tell Monsieur
Misty about it is the question.</i>

23:51.380 --> 23:53.143
<i>"Perhaps it is yet too early,"</i>

23:53.215 --> 23:55.479
"but the fruit of the lemon"

23:55.551 --> 23:58.987
"is beginning to leave a bitter
after-taste in the palate."

23:59.054 --> 24:00.282
"More later."

24:00.355 --> 24:02.346
<i>Who is Monsieur Misty?</i>

24:04.092 --> 24:05.787
Ray Lemon.
What?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.419
"The fruit of the lemon"

24:07.496 --> 24:09.964
"is beginning to leave a
bitter aftertaste in the palate"

24:10.032 --> 24:13.661
<i>I think he's talking about Ray Lemon,
the hotel detective at the Royal Surf.</i>

24:13.735 --> 24:15.600
<i>Oh, that's an awfully
big reach, Thomas.</i>

24:15.671 --> 24:16.865
<i>No, but maybe not, Carol.</i>

24:16.939 --> 24:18.463
<i>I mean, Jean Claude
wasn't the kind of guy</i>

24:18.540 --> 24:20.770
who'd come all the way from
France just to give me an award.

24:20.842 --> 24:22.969
You're worrying about your
award at a time like this?

24:23.045 --> 24:24.444
<i>Oh, no, no, no!
I'm not! I'm not!</i>

24:24.513 --> 24:26.538
<i>I mean, that's not important
now. It's just that...</i>

24:26.615 --> 24:30.415
<i>Carol, I mean, Jean Claude and
I didn't always see eye to eye.</i>

24:30.485 --> 24:34.512
<i>Why would he, of all people, come
all that way to give you the award?</i>

24:34.590 --> 24:36.455
Exactly.
Unless he was on a case.

24:36.525 --> 24:39.688
<i>Tracking down Monsieur Misty,
who you think is Ray Lemon.</i>

24:39.761 --> 24:41.695
<i>No, I'm Monsieur Misty.</i>

24:43.031 --> 24:44.157
What?

24:45.467 --> 24:47.162
This is stupid.

24:48.937 --> 24:53.101
<i>Well, on the Dubray case, you know,
we went to this sing-along bar.</i>

24:54.676 --> 24:56.405
<i>I kind of sang Misty.</i>

24:58.447 --> 24:59.914
<i>Oh, Thomas.</i>

25:00.816 --> 25:02.579
What did he sing?

25:02.651 --> 25:05.882
<i>I don't know.
Sentimental Journey.</i>

25:06.488 --> 25:08.012
Our song!

25:09.958 --> 25:11.550
<i>Oh, Thomas...</i>

25:12.527 --> 25:14.427
<i>Oh, no, Carol, I'm sorry.</i>

25:14.496 --> 25:16.327
<i>Look, don't do that.
It's okay.</i>

25:19.635 --> 25:21.569
He'd want you to go on.

25:22.371 --> 25:23.565
Okay.

25:24.673 --> 25:26.004
Okay.

25:28.410 --> 25:31.641
<i>I'll be waiting up for heaven.</i>

25:32.147 --> 25:35.605
<i>Counting every mile
of railroad track.</i>

25:36.518 --> 25:38.611
He'd want you to go on.

25:40.022 --> 25:41.284
Okay.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.825
<i>So, could you put your computer on overtime?</i>

25:45.894 --> 25:47.521
<i>You know, any name.</i>

25:47.596 --> 25:50.121
<i>A dry cleaners, a clerk at a flower
shop that could mean something...</i>

25:50.198 --> 25:52.928
How did you know
that he sent me flowers?

25:53.402 --> 25:56.894
I don't know.
He was that kind of guy.

25:58.573 --> 26:00.336
<i>Oh, Thomas...</i>

26:00.409 --> 26:03.845
<i>Oh, no, Carol, now don't do
that. It's okay, it's okay.</i>

26:04.046 --> 26:06.310
<i>Oh, it's okay.
Don't do that.</i>

26:16.858 --> 26:18.826
Stay down.
No problem.

26:23.732 --> 26:25.927
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

26:27.669 --> 26:31.105
<i>Sorry to barge in like this,
but some wimp just shot me.</i>

26:42.066 --> 26:44.193
<i>What's the prognosis, Doctor?</i>

26:44.268 --> 26:45.667
He'll live.

26:46.637 --> 26:48.571
Any lasting repercussions?

26:48.639 --> 26:51.574
I think the javelin throw
is out for the time being.

26:51.642 --> 26:52.700
Can he talk now?

26:52.777 --> 26:53.971
<i>Oh, he can talk all right.</i>

26:54.045 --> 26:56.536
<i>As a matter of fact, he hasn't quit
talking since we brought him in here.</i>

26:56.614 --> 26:57.638
Great.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.876
I'll check in on him later.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.481
This isn't going to work.

27:02.553 --> 27:05.044
Of course it will. It always
has for you in the past.

27:05.122 --> 27:09.354
<i>Yes, but in the past, there was a
certain basic level of intelligence.</i>

27:09.427 --> 27:10.416
Whereas here...

27:10.494 --> 27:11.893
<i>It's okay, Chuckie.</i>

27:11.963 --> 27:13.794
We'll find the guys
who did this to you.

27:13.864 --> 27:15.161
<i>Oh, no. Not again.</i>

27:15.233 --> 27:16.928
<i>Who's Chuckie?
Come on, Higgins.</i>

27:17.001 --> 27:19.401
This could be our only chance to
find out who was shooting at him.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.199
Who's Chuckie?

27:21.439 --> 27:22.929
Very well.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.803
Keep your eyes on the watch.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.848
<i>I got my own watch, Chuckie.</i>

27:31.916 --> 27:32.974
Would you tell me
who Chuckie is?

27:34.318 --> 27:36.286
You're getting sleepy.

27:37.054 --> 27:40.182
You will remember
everything you saw last night.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.588
Blanche.

27:41.659 --> 27:44.560
Who's Blanche?
Will you be quiet? Please.

27:50.434 --> 27:52.561
<i>Higgins, it's working.</i>

27:55.906 --> 27:58.636
Perhaps I overestimated
the requirements.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.939
Will you ask him about the car?

28:01.846 --> 28:04.041
Try to visualize last night.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.746
You were following Magnum.

28:06.817 --> 28:10.913
<i>Magnum. Oh, yeah.
Too bad about his award.</i>

28:12.623 --> 28:15.148
I wish everyone would
forget about that award.

28:15.226 --> 28:16.853
It's just
a silly piece of metal.

28:16.927 --> 28:18.326
Steuben glass.

28:18.396 --> 28:20.728
I saw it
in Richard Lindley's office.

28:20.798 --> 28:22.595
Etched on the base.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.960
Can we get back to the car?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.525
<i>Uh, just a minute, Carol.
Car?</i>

28:25.603 --> 28:27.366
<i>Uh, wait a minute, Luther.</i>

28:27.438 --> 28:28.996
What was etched on the award?

28:29.073 --> 28:30.404
I thought
you didn't care about it.

28:30.474 --> 28:31.736
I don't. But...

28:31.809 --> 28:36.872
Perhaps they could present it at Jean
Claude's grave site right after the eulogy.

28:40.184 --> 28:43.312
Try to see the car
that was following Magnum.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.789
<i>It's all coming back to me
now, Chuckie.</i>

28:47.958 --> 28:50.426
<i>Two-tone blue,
four-door sedan.</i>

28:50.628 --> 28:51.686
Lemon?

28:51.762 --> 28:53.992
<i>No, it was a pretty good car.</i>

28:54.565 --> 28:56.294
<i>Thanks, Higgins.
You did it.</i>

28:56.434 --> 28:57.867
Come here.

28:58.569 --> 29:00.400
<i>You take the diary,
get on the computer.</i>

29:00.471 --> 29:03.235
On the count of three
you will wake up.

29:03.507 --> 29:04.496
And what about you?
One...

29:04.575 --> 29:06.008
I got to pick something up
at the estate

29:06.077 --> 29:08.045
and then I'm gonna stay on
him for as long as it takes.

29:08.112 --> 29:09.909
<i>If Jean Claude was right,</i>

29:09.980 --> 29:12.540
Lemon is gonna slip up somewhere along
the way and I'm going to be there.

29:12.616 --> 29:14.208
<i>Oh, Thomas...
Two...</i>

29:14.285 --> 29:16.651
<i>Jonathan, Thomas,
I can't thank you enough</i>

29:16.721 --> 29:19.087
for everything that you're
doing for Jean Claude.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.056
One question?
Three.

29:22.693 --> 29:24.183
Who's Chuckie?

29:24.261 --> 29:26.991
Only the best ex-partner
a guy ever had.

29:27.064 --> 29:28.929
God rest his soul.

29:30.701 --> 29:32.931
What are you guys doing here?

29:33.204 --> 29:34.501
Leaving.

29:37.808 --> 29:42.302
This is the first hospital room I ever
stayed in that had it's own butler.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.748
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

29:53.824 --> 29:56.315
<i>Maybe I hadn't been
completely honest with myself.</i>

29:56.394 --> 29:59.227
<i>Maybe I did kind of
want that award.</i>

30:00.097 --> 30:02.429
<i>I mean, to be recognized
by your peers,</i>

30:02.500 --> 30:05.663
<i>I guess that meant something
to me after all.</i>

30:06.170 --> 30:09.936
<i>But I knew I had to put that
behind me and just do my work.</i>

30:10.074 --> 30:13.407
<i>Which tonight meant watching
Ray Lemon make his rounds,</i>

30:13.477 --> 30:16.207
<i>questioning people
about Jean Claude.</i>

30:16.414 --> 30:19.212
<i>Just another private
investigator doing his job.</i>

30:19.283 --> 30:22.480
<i>Except whatever job he was
doing at this time of night,</i>

30:22.553 --> 30:26.080
<i>he was doing in the car that was
driven by the guy that shot Luther.</i>

30:26.157 --> 30:27.715
<i>I guess
that's called moonlighting.</i>

30:32.062 --> 30:34.895
<i>Okay, boys, freeze! The
banana train gets off here!</i>

30:39.904 --> 30:41.997
Luther! Luther!

30:42.673 --> 30:44.766
I bet you're glad to see me!

30:44.842 --> 30:46.673
No!
What? What an ingrate!

30:46.744 --> 30:48.974
Ingrate! You're the one
who screwed everything up!

30:49.046 --> 30:50.809
Me? Me?
I was saving you!

30:50.881 --> 30:52.542
You are not!

30:52.616 --> 30:54.106
I am too!

30:54.919 --> 30:56.546
I'm out of here.

31:18.175 --> 31:21.667
I would've at least gotten
the license plate number.

31:22.780 --> 31:26.773
I can't believe you just went
out there and didn't even tell me.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.411
Didn't you get a good look
at the guy's face?

31:31.489 --> 31:32.854
<i>No, I...</i>

31:32.923 --> 31:34.618
What was the make of the car?

31:34.692 --> 31:35.716
<i>It was dark, I...</i>

31:35.793 --> 31:38.990
<i>You know, Tom, you're not exactly
contributing your fair share here.</i>

31:39.063 --> 31:41.930
Me? Me? I'm the only one
doing anything!

31:42.333 --> 31:45.166
<i>Well, it doesn't seem to me
like you're doing very much.</i>

31:45.236 --> 31:47.932
It's you guys who are making
a shambles of this case.

31:48.005 --> 31:51.031
All you really care about are
your stupid little fantasies

31:51.108 --> 31:53.167
about being
private investigators.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.405
You don't give a damn about
who gets hurt or killed.

31:55.479 --> 31:57.037
<i>And you should
know better, Luther.</i>

31:57.114 --> 31:58.376
<i>All your years in the business,</i>

31:58.449 --> 32:02.215
you come busting into a discreet little
stake-out with both barrels blazing.

32:02.286 --> 32:03.651
You could have
got yourself killed!

32:03.721 --> 32:05.211
<i>Or worse, me!</i>

32:05.589 --> 32:08.183
You see if I ever bail you
out of a jam again!

32:08.259 --> 32:10.591
You don't have to! I don't
want you to! Just leave!

32:10.661 --> 32:12.720
<i>Ah, stuff it, scrungo!</i>

32:21.739 --> 32:23.934
<i>No offense, Magnum, but,</i>

32:24.441 --> 32:27.968
<i>gee, you've changed.</i>

32:29.079 --> 32:31.138
<i>Tracy, it's 5:00
in the morning.</i>

32:31.215 --> 32:34.275
<i>Well, that's no excuse for
being rude to your friends.</i>

32:34.351 --> 32:35.545
He's not my friends.

32:35.619 --> 32:38.247
<i>Well, no wonder,
the way you treat him.</i>

32:38.355 --> 32:42.724
<i>You know, I'm not so sure you weren't
at our little party at Wahiawa.</i>

32:47.097 --> 32:49.964
I don't have to
tell you anything.

32:52.169 --> 32:55.605
<i>You want us out of your way,
I am out of your way.</i>

32:59.109 --> 33:02.306
I'm almost glad
you didn't get your award.

33:06.050 --> 33:09.508
A P.I. Who can't even get
a license plate number!

33:25.402 --> 33:27.336
<i>Hello?
Carol.</i>

33:27.404 --> 33:29.634
<i>Yeah, it's... I know
it's 5:30 in the morning.</i>

33:29.707 --> 33:31.174
I got a license number
on the car

33:31.241 --> 33:34.039
belonging to the guy that the
hotel detective was meeting.

33:34.111 --> 33:36.477
<i>Oh, great.
Well, give it to me.</i>

33:37.114 --> 33:38.604
Mmm-hmm.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.307
<i>Okay, I'll go right in.
What are you gonna do?</i>

33:41.385 --> 33:43.182
Go check on a lemon.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.188
<i>Ray Lemon certainly
was keeping odd hours.</i>

33:47.257 --> 33:49.589
<i>He wasn't in his quarters
or his office,</i>

33:49.660 --> 33:51.127
<i>and I was beginning to wonder</i>

33:51.195 --> 33:53.925
<i>whether because of the
evening's rather exciting events,</i>

33:53.998 --> 33:57.729
<i>he'd decided to quit the mundane
tedium of being a hotel detective</i>

33:57.801 --> 34:00.429
<i>and decided to go for shooting
people in the dead of night</i>

34:00.504 --> 34:02.665
<i>as a full-time occupation.</i>

34:10.714 --> 34:13.239
<i>At any rate,
at least I could ask.</i>

34:31.802 --> 34:35.260
Does the phrase "material
witness" mean anything to you?

34:36.940 --> 34:39.101
<i>No, but "sleep" does.</i>

34:39.176 --> 34:41.735
<i>Well, there'll be plenty
of time for that, partner.</i>

34:41.812 --> 34:46.112
<i>As a matter of fact, Ray Lemon's
gonna be sleeping a mighty long time.</i>

34:46.283 --> 34:48.808
<i>You know, I thought after Ray
got himself kicked off the force</i>

34:48.886 --> 34:50.978
that he'd clean his act up.

34:51.522 --> 34:55.083
You know anything about multiple gunshots
being fired last night near Wahiawa?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.059
<i>No.
Come on, Magnum.</i>

34:57.628 --> 35:00.529
<i>If I answer that question,
will you answer one for me?</i>

35:00.597 --> 35:01.996
<i>Okay, you first.</i>

35:02.066 --> 35:03.363
<i>No, you first.</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:04.560
No. I'm a cop.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.661
<i>No, I'm an award-winning... Almost
award-winning private investigator</i>

35:07.738 --> 35:09.603
<i>on a cold streak.
Humor me, huh?</i>

35:09.673 --> 35:11.004
Okay.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.771
What division of the Sûreté
was Jean Claude assigned to?

35:13.844 --> 35:15.744
International
Narcotic Smuggling.

35:15.813 --> 35:16.939
I knew it.

35:17.014 --> 35:20.506
You know anything about multiple gunshots
being fired last night near Wahiawa?

35:20.584 --> 35:22.381
Yes.
I knew it!

35:22.453 --> 35:23.886
I knew they'd been fired
because you told me.

35:23.954 --> 35:26.388
<i>And I know you wouldn't have told me
unless, in fact, they'd been fired.</i>

35:26.457 --> 35:27.481
<i>Other than that, I know nothing.</i>

35:27.558 --> 35:30.083
<i>Except for the fact that if I hear
something, I'll certainly let you know.</i>

35:30.160 --> 35:33.152
<i>In the meantime,
I'm long overdue for a nap.</i>

36:07.765 --> 36:09.960
<i>Listen, Thomas.
The car from last night,</i>

36:10.033 --> 36:11.898
<i>the guy that Lemon was meeting,</i>

36:11.969 --> 36:13.994
<i>well, it was a rental.</i>

36:14.304 --> 36:15.828
Great. A name?

36:15.906 --> 36:17.703
<i>I'm afraid we've reached
a dead end, Thomas.</i>

36:17.775 --> 36:21.267
It was rented to a woman.
Somebody named Tracy Spencer.

36:29.068 --> 36:31.901
<i>It had to have been
lack of sleep.</i>

36:32.505 --> 36:35.474
<i>That's the only thing that would
have made me leap to the conclusion</i>

36:35.541 --> 36:37.099
<i>that Tracy Spencer,</i>

36:37.176 --> 36:39.576
<i>ex-meter maid,
ex-police detective,</i>

36:39.646 --> 36:41.375
<i>aspiring private investigator,</i>

36:41.447 --> 36:43.608
<i>and 24-hour accident,</i>

36:43.683 --> 36:46.413
<i>could possibly have been
involved in a drug ring</i>

36:46.486 --> 36:50.217
<i>being investigated by the great
Jean Claude Fornier himself.</i>

37:08.307 --> 37:09.331
<i>On the other hand,</i>

37:09.409 --> 37:13.072
<i>sometimes lack of sleep can
make you acutely insightful.</i>

37:32.298 --> 37:34.027
<i>I knew I had two choices.</i>

37:34.100 --> 37:37.831
<i>Go get some sleep, or find out
exactly what Tracy was up to.</i>

37:37.904 --> 37:39.462
<i>Hold it, Tracy.</i>

37:41.874 --> 37:44.138
Let me count the felonies.

37:45.111 --> 37:46.408
Magnum.

37:47.647 --> 37:48.671
Hi.

37:48.748 --> 37:50.375
What was in the package?

37:50.450 --> 37:52.042
What package?

37:52.652 --> 37:56.213
<i>Tracy, you can talk to me
or you can talk to the police.</i>

37:59.325 --> 38:01.657
I don't have to
tell you anything.

38:01.728 --> 38:03.593
I'm not talking to you anymore.

38:03.663 --> 38:05.324
Fine. Don't talk.

38:05.531 --> 38:08.967
Just paw the ground or
something every time I'm right.

38:09.669 --> 38:13.537
<i>Like Trigger?
Very funny, Magnum.</i>

38:13.606 --> 38:15.506
<i>No, Tracy,
nothing's funny at all.</i>

38:15.575 --> 38:16.906
Especially to Jean Claude.

38:16.976 --> 38:20.810
<i>You know, he was really here on
a drug smuggling investigation.</i>

38:27.987 --> 38:32.424
<i>And the stuff was probably
coming in from the Far East,</i>

38:32.492 --> 38:36.952
but how do the dealers get it
past the DEA and the local police

38:37.029 --> 38:39.088
when they've been cracking
down on them like crazy

38:39.165 --> 38:40.928
the last couple of years?

38:47.273 --> 38:49.673
Why not use the prestige
and good offices

38:49.742 --> 38:52.142
of one of the country's
largest detective agencies?

38:52.211 --> 38:55.908
<i>They could get the stuff through
where it has to go, right?</i>

39:00.419 --> 39:02.512
<i>I mean, Richard Lindley
probably realized</i>

39:02.588 --> 39:06.046
there's a lot more money
in distribution than divorce.

39:06.192 --> 39:07.284
<i>And maybe you did, too.</i>

39:07.360 --> 39:08.918
That's a lie!

39:09.962 --> 39:11.827
Are we talking now?

39:12.899 --> 39:14.867
<i>What happened, Tracy, did
Jean Claude get close enough</i>

39:14.934 --> 39:17.903
to figuring it out that you had the
cook you just met with poison him?

39:17.970 --> 39:19.369
Wrong! Wrong!
Wrong! Wrong!

39:19.438 --> 39:20.928
Prove it!

39:24.177 --> 39:27.943
I overheard Lindley on the
phone with this guy last night.

39:28.514 --> 39:31.574
<i>At first, the old super flash
was a little surprised,</i>

39:31.651 --> 39:33.676
<i>but when I acted
all enthusiastic-like,</i>

39:33.753 --> 39:36.483
<i>see, he agreed
to let me in on it.</i>

39:38.591 --> 39:41.856
<i>You see?
I'm working undercover, too!</i>

39:42.161 --> 39:43.685
I was just gonna
get the goods on these guys

39:43.763 --> 39:46.391
<i>and just blow them
into the cops, see?</i>

39:46.732 --> 39:48.563
Get my own award.

39:50.636 --> 39:53.764
<i>Tracy, the shooting
in Wahiawa last night,</i>

39:54.240 --> 39:57.209
the license plate on the car
came back to you.

39:59.545 --> 40:02.776
Lindley borrowed that car.
You gotta believe me.

40:06.586 --> 40:07.814
I do.

40:08.921 --> 40:10.149
You do?

40:10.223 --> 40:13.920
I do. No one would come up with a lame
excuse like "Lindley borrowed the car"

40:13.993 --> 40:15.722
unless it was true.

40:15.795 --> 40:17.660
He said he had to meet somebody. Lemon.

40:17.730 --> 40:19.527
<i>No, it's a pretty good car.
Really.</i>

40:19.599 --> 40:22.625
<i>Ray Lemon, the bad cop
turned house detective.</i>

40:22.702 --> 40:25.865
<i>You know, he was probably
ripping Lindley off.</i>

40:26.239 --> 40:31.267
You just figured out a whole day's
investigative work on my part.

40:31.344 --> 40:33.175
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

40:35.348 --> 40:40.684
<i>Tracy, would you consider
working together again?</i>

40:44.724 --> 40:46.123
Really?

40:46.192 --> 40:47.523
Really.

40:56.769 --> 40:59.101
Rick? T. C?
You both on? Good.

40:59.171 --> 41:02.265
How would you like to
share part of my award?

41:03.743 --> 41:05.301
Of course
I'm still gonna get it.

41:05.378 --> 41:07.778
But that's not important
right now.

41:07.847 --> 41:11.146
<i>Oh, come on, guys. There's
nothing to this. Honest.</i>

41:12.718 --> 41:14.151
<i>Hey, what's the matter
with you guys?</i>

41:14.220 --> 41:17.587
Your friend's in trouble.
Are you real men or what?

41:18.224 --> 41:22.991
<i>Hello, Luther. Yeah, I've been kind of
having second thoughts about stuff and...</i>

41:24.063 --> 41:25.462
Magnum.

41:25.865 --> 41:27.355
Thomas Magnum.

41:31.737 --> 41:35.002
<i>Hello, can I speak to
Richard Lindley?</i>

41:36.175 --> 41:37.972
Tracy Spencer.

41:40.546 --> 41:42.013
<i>Hello, Dick?</i>

41:43.249 --> 41:45.547
We have a little problem.

41:57.229 --> 41:58.753
Two minutes.

42:16.916 --> 42:19.441
<i>Hold it, you guys can't
park here. Nobody move!</i>

42:19.518 --> 42:21.918
<i>Now, wait a minute, don't get
nervous. It's not what you think.</i>

42:21.988 --> 42:24.286
I think it's exactly what I think. Freeze.

42:24.357 --> 42:25.984
But we...
Freeze!

42:27.893 --> 42:29.520
Tracy.

42:31.697 --> 42:32.789
Thanks for coming.

42:32.865 --> 42:35.163
<i>Well, what's the big problem?</i>

42:37.937 --> 42:41.566
<i>It's Chang,
he wants to renegotiate.</i>

42:42.441 --> 42:43.999
Why didn't he come to me?

42:44.076 --> 42:45.543
I don't know.

42:46.078 --> 42:48.638
<i>I guess he just, you know,
like, wants to use me as</i>

42:48.714 --> 42:51.615
<i>you know, like,
a middleperson or something.</i>

42:51.851 --> 42:55.617
Or maybe
you want to renegotiate.

42:58.791 --> 43:03.057
<i>Oh, no! No, no, no.</i>

43:03.362 --> 43:05.330
<i>Chang said that, you know,</i>

43:05.398 --> 43:07.195
like he was just giving away
pure heroin to you

43:07.266 --> 43:09.564
like he was in the charity
business or something.

43:09.635 --> 43:11.694
Uh-huh.
What are we gonna do?

43:11.771 --> 43:14.103
<i>Well, we'll take care of him.</i>

43:15.741 --> 43:18.972
We pay him good money
for that stuff. Good money.

43:20.079 --> 43:21.979
<i>Thanks a lot, Tracy.</i>

43:22.314 --> 43:25.477
I think you have a real
future in this company.

43:25.551 --> 43:27.951
And I don't think
you've got any.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.113
<i>Everyone relax.
Nice going, Tracy.</i>

43:30.189 --> 43:31.622
Thanks.

43:34.393 --> 43:38.489
Perhaps we could make a deal
for that recording?

43:38.564 --> 43:40.327
<i>It's still running, Lindley.</i>

43:40.399 --> 43:42.094
And you still have to
get it out of here.

43:42.168 --> 43:44.466
<i>Yeah, I guess so,
but unfortunately for you,</i>

43:44.537 --> 43:47.404
I... We've got
plenty of help.

43:51.277 --> 43:53.040
<i>Reach for the sky, mister.</i>

43:54.547 --> 43:56.572
<i>Believe me, Officer, just
go down to the supply room...</i>

44:05.724 --> 44:07.919
Something must've gone wrong.

44:13.666 --> 44:15.293
So what do we do?

44:17.736 --> 44:19.067
Duck!

44:21.507 --> 44:23.771
That's what we've been
trying to tell you!

44:24.443 --> 44:25.569
See?

44:26.011 --> 44:28.036
<i>Come on, the supply room.</i>

45:00.913 --> 45:03.006
<i>Hello, Inspector.
How do you feel?</i>

45:03.082 --> 45:05.482
<i>Oh, shucks, little lady.
It ain't nothing.</i>

45:05.551 --> 45:07.246
Just a flesh wound.

45:07.319 --> 45:08.809
And Luther.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.489
Mr. Gillis.

45:12.825 --> 45:14.816
<i>Thanks, Higgie.
Appreciate it.</i>

45:14.894 --> 45:16.054
Quite.

45:16.128 --> 45:17.288
Can I sniff them?

45:17.363 --> 45:18.762
Of course.

45:25.538 --> 45:27.028
T.C.

45:31.010 --> 45:32.238
<i>I'd get up, but...</i>

45:32.311 --> 45:34.279
Don't you even try.

45:34.346 --> 45:35.574
Rick.

45:35.648 --> 45:37.616
<i>Geez, I was kind of
hoping for chocolates.</i>

45:37.683 --> 45:39.480
I'll speak to the patient
across the hall.

45:39.552 --> 45:41.850
Perhaps we can arrange a trade.

45:42.488 --> 45:44.080
And Tracy.

45:44.156 --> 45:46.181
Congratulations.
Nice work.

45:49.261 --> 45:51.286
<i>Oh, yeah, I know.</i>

45:52.498 --> 45:53.965
And last...

45:56.502 --> 45:58.060
But not least.

45:58.137 --> 45:59.468
Higgins. Carol.

45:59.538 --> 46:01.733
The police department
sent this over for you.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.740
<i>Apparently, they found it
in Lindley's room.</i>

46:03.809 --> 46:06.573
He was using it
to keep his window open.

46:09.615 --> 46:11.412
That's it? My award!

46:11.483 --> 46:12.916
Your award.

46:12.985 --> 46:15.317
Not that it's important.

46:18.891 --> 46:20.290
Gee...

46:20.526 --> 46:22.585
I don't know what to say.

46:22.928 --> 46:25.021
You could always start
with your acceptance speech.

46:25.097 --> 46:27.395
Acceptance speech? I don't
really have an acceptance speech.

46:27.466 --> 46:29.525
What?

46:33.639 --> 46:34.970
Okay.

46:35.174 --> 46:36.937
It all started...

46:37.476 --> 46:39.068
This is silly.

46:41.380 --> 46:42.870
It all started

46:44.817 --> 46:49.811
in a tiny little town in
Virginia some 30 odd years ago.

46:50.923 --> 46:54.086
<i>And I have climbed, steadfastly</i>

46:54.760 --> 46:57.320
<i>and with great care,</i>

46:57.396 --> 47:02.060
<i>to this pinnacle
of investigatory significance,</i>

47:02.935 --> 47:07.838
<i>and now I hold in my hand,
finally, this cherished award...</i>
