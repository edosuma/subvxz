Yolande...
uh-- where is everybody?

00:10.790 --> 00:13.170
How is Gabi
gonna be surprised
when there's no one here?

Surprise!
-(screams)

00:17.540 --> 00:20.210
That was good!

00:20.210 --> 00:23.000
Damn, Josh, were you
this nervous when you threw
my surprise party?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.170
That wasn't a surprise party,
that was an intervention.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.420
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.620
Hey, I didn't get
a surprise party, either.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.170
How do you know
I'm not planning
on throwing you one?

00:33.170 --> 00:35.380
Because my birthday
was last week.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.500
Yeah.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.460
That's why I'm plannin' it
for next week, throw you off.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.210
But now, since you ruined
the surprise, I guess I gotta
call everybody and cancel it.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.710
Damn it.

00:44.710 --> 00:48.080
Josh, are you sure about this?
Gabi really doesn't
like surprises.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.290
(laughs)
Sofia... who are you
talking to?

00:53.040 --> 00:55.460
I'm the master surpriser.
She wants this.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.830
She wants this bad.

00:57.830 --> 01:03.170
Okay, everybody, remember.
The code word... is waffles.

01:03.170 --> 01:07.120
When I say "waffles",
you guys jump up and yell
surprise, got it?

01:07.120 --> 01:09.380
-Oh, she's here! She's here!
-Get down, get down,
everybody get down!

01:18.710 --> 01:19.830
Morning, Josh.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.540
Good morning, indeed.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.290
So, uh... guess
you really wanna know
what I want for breakfast.

01:27.290 --> 01:31.290
Oh! Um... I actually--
I just picked up all the fixings
for omelettes, so...

01:31.290 --> 01:33.460
Ooh, omelettes
are so good.

Gabi? I brought home

02:20.620 --> 02:22.880
(whines)
Ohhh, I hate today.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.210
I smell that cupcake.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.250
What cupcake?

02:32.250 --> 02:34.290
I don't want it.
I don't want anything.

02:34.290 --> 02:36.170
Okay, Gabi,
what's going on?

02:36.170 --> 02:37.880
Why did you run out
of Josh's so fast?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.000
You've always loved
your birthday.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.830
You wouldn't understand.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.500
You're still young.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.080
You're three weeks
older than me.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.210
Well, let me tell you something.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.120
The big two-five hits you
like a ton o' bricks.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.830
One minute life's all...

02:53.830 --> 02:56.080
roller skates and snow cones,

02:56.080 --> 02:58.960
and next minute it's
just broken promises

02:58.960 --> 03:00.880
and shattered dreams!

03:00.880 --> 03:03.460
Oh my god, there's frosting
in the middle!

03:03.460 --> 03:07.000
Whoa, I'm having
a quarter-life crisis here!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.500
Oh, sorry, okay.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.830
Tell me what's really going on.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.330
-Nothing.
-Gabi.

03:12.620 --> 03:13.670
Fine.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
My dad got me this.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.120
Ohh. This is nasty.

03:21.790 --> 03:22.880
I see what's going on.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.580
You're turning 25
and all you got

03:24.580 --> 03:26.000
was this crappy globe.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.540
It's not a crappy globe,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.500
it's a piggy bank in the shape
of a crappy globe.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.420
How is this card from your mom?

03:34.420 --> 03:36.080
She gave it to me
on my 15th birthday

03:36.080 --> 03:37.960
so we could save up
for our trip together.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.670
We put quarters in there,
so that when I turned 25,

03:40.670 --> 03:43.460
we could have enough
to go on a culinary adventure

03:43.460 --> 03:44.790
around the globe.

03:44.790 --> 03:47.040
Ohh, quarters.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.380
That's so cute.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.290
Twenty-five for 25.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.790
Oh my god, I just got that.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.920
Huh. And we were gonna
go to New York,

03:56.920 --> 03:58.330
and Paris, and Venice.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.290
Now I'm never gonna
get to go to any of those places

04:01.290 --> 04:02.960
with her 'cause she's gone.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.330
(knocking on door)

04:07.790 --> 04:10.330
-Thank you.
-Oh my god,

04:10.330 --> 04:12.420
birthday flowers from Josh?
Didn't he get the message?

04:12.420 --> 04:13.750
I don't want anything.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.710
Actually, these are
for Ms. Wilson, downstairs.

04:16.710 --> 04:18.790
(crying)
So Josh didn't even
get me flowers?

04:26.920 --> 04:30.290
Gabi crying
and champagne?
Best day ever!

04:31.790 --> 04:33.960
Look! Gabi's birthday gifts!

04:33.960 --> 04:35.830
-(gasps) I wonder
what Josh got her.
-Mmm.

04:35.830 --> 04:40.540
Oh! Thigh-high
Italian leather boots!

04:40.540 --> 04:43.000
In my almost size!

04:43.000 --> 04:47.290
A limited edition,
oversized unisex
designer tote!

04:47.290 --> 04:48.420
I love it!

04:49.880 --> 04:52.790
Hey! Get your hands
off Gabi's gifts.
They're goin' back.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.710
Both:
No!

04:56.750 --> 04:59.460
(whispering)
If we let him take 'em back,
they'll be gone forever.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.420
But if we make sure
they get to Gabi,

05:01.420 --> 05:03.500
we can borrow them,
keep them for a long time,

05:03.500 --> 05:06.710
and she'll forget she ever
owned them, and ipso fatso,

05:06.710 --> 05:08.210
we'll own them!

05:09.210 --> 05:12.290
(both sing-song)
Josh!

05:12.290 --> 05:16.750
Remember how, thanks to you,
Gabi ran outta here devastated
on her birthday?

05:16.750 --> 05:17.790
What's your point?

05:17.790 --> 05:21.750
The point is,
wouldn't you want
to make it up to her?

05:21.750 --> 05:24.710
W-- Of course I want to,
but I blew it so hard
at that party,

05:24.710 --> 05:26.790
there's no coming back
from that.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.750
Unless...

05:28.750 --> 05:30.750
What, you guys
have an idea?

05:30.750 --> 05:31.920
Totes!

05:36.750 --> 05:38.460
Happy Birthday,
Ms. Wilson!

05:39.710 --> 05:41.250
You got me flowers?

05:41.250 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.380
No.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.580
They accidentally
delivered 'em

05:46.580 --> 05:48.080
to our place by mistake,
which is weird,

05:48.080 --> 05:49.170
'cause it's my birthday, too.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.620
-Get outta here.
-No, I'm serious.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.330
So am I.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.710
Okay, I'll just, uh,
put your flowers down over here.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.710
By the way, the card
wasn't signed.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.750
Who's your secret admirer?

06:01.750 --> 06:03.710
I don't know.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.710
Maybe my CrossFit trainer?

06:07.380 --> 06:08.960
Or, they could be
from Bernie.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.620
(gasps)
Sanders?

06:12.710 --> 06:13.710
Schwartz.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.580
But Sanders...
I wouldn't mind

06:17.580 --> 06:20.670
running my fingers
through that hair.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.500
So, uh, who's
Bernie Schwartz?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.210
He's a man I met
in Vegas 20 years ago,

06:26.210 --> 06:27.710
when we were married.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.000
Gabi and Sofia:
Ohhh.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.460
And not to each other.

06:30.460 --> 06:31.790
Ahhh!

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
Oh, wow!

06:35.040 --> 06:38.830
Check it out.
"In a city of lights,
none shined brighter than you.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.750
I will never forget our kiss."

06:40.750 --> 06:43.080
(gasp)
You kissed Bernie
while you were married?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.830
What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.920
(laughing)

06:47.920 --> 06:49.670
"Fate brought us together
at the wrong time,

06:49.670 --> 06:52.290
"but, baby,
if by some chance
we're both single

06:52.290 --> 06:53.620
"on our 95th birthdays,

06:53.620 --> 06:55.580
"let's meet right back
at the Bellagio

06:55.580 --> 06:57.670
in the honeymoon suite
at midnight."

06:57.670 --> 06:59.750
(gasp)
Do you know
what this means?

06:59.750 --> 07:02.710
I still have 70 years
to meet someone!

07:02.710 --> 07:05.830
My god, this is so romantic,
it's just like Sleepless
in Seattle.

07:05.830 --> 07:07.790
You have to go to Vegas,
Ms. Wilson!

07:07.790 --> 07:11.670
-Uh, nope.
-What do you mean, nope?

07:11.670 --> 07:15.250
What if I show up,
and find out he's gone
to a better place?

07:15.250 --> 07:17.250
Oh... like the Venetian?

07:20.460 --> 07:23.170
Is she really this dumb?

07:23.170 --> 07:26.580
Ms. Wilson, if you don't go,
how are you gonna know?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.670
Oh my god! This is it!

07:28.670 --> 07:29.710
A birthday trip!

07:29.710 --> 07:32.250
Okay, you are going to Vegas,
and we are taking you.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.620
We have eight hours
till midnight!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.620
I'll go on one condition...

07:38.330 --> 07:40.210
Vegas, baby!

07:44.580 --> 07:48.250
(laughs)
This is the most fun
I've ever had...

07:48.250 --> 07:50.960
in the front seat of a car.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.750
Um, Ms. Wilson,
just because you are 95,

07:53.750 --> 07:55.710
doesn't mean you have
to drive 95!

07:55.710 --> 07:57.920
Oh, you only live once!

07:57.920 --> 07:59.620
And you only die once, too!

07:59.620 --> 08:02.580
I bet she's not even
allowed to drive. They probably
took her license 20 years ago!

08:02.580 --> 08:04.000
Wrong!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.670
I never had a license!

08:06.670 --> 08:07.750
Gabi and Sofia:
What?

08:07.750 --> 08:10.580
-(police siren)
-(gasp) Thank God!

08:10.580 --> 08:12.620
They want you
to pull over.
Pull over! Pull over!

08:14.710 --> 08:18.000
My parole officer's
gonna be pissed.

08:25.250 --> 08:28.580
Can I just say...
bringing Gabi these presents

08:28.580 --> 08:30.920
to make up
for that stupid surprise party

08:30.920 --> 08:33.580
we were gonna throw
is a-genius.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.750
That's weird, it's open.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.380
It's okay.
There's nothing here
worth stealing.

08:43.670 --> 08:44.670
Gabi?

08:44.670 --> 08:45.880
Where is she?

08:45.880 --> 08:47.830
Let me check the bedroom.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.380
I love these boots!

08:54.580 --> 08:56.460
Oh my god, what--
what if something
happened to her?

08:56.460 --> 09:00.620
I can't lose the girl I--
I employ as my chef.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.880
Josh, she's not
in the bedroom.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.500
I'm callin' her.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.460
Hey, Gabi, where are you?

09:09.460 --> 09:11.920
Hey, Josh, I'm on my way
to Vegas.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.670
What? I-- I thought you said
you didn't wanna celebrate?

09:15.670 --> 09:17.670
Yeah, I-- I know,
it's-- it's a long story,

09:17.670 --> 09:19.460
but I'm headed
to the Bellagio.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.290
God willing.

09:21.290 --> 09:22.540
Okay, bye.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.040
-She's going to Vegas.
-Vegas?

09:27.040 --> 09:29.420
Vegas?

09:29.420 --> 09:32.380
It's not that she didn't
wanna celebrate her birthday...

09:32.380 --> 09:34.580
she didn't wanna celebrate
her birthday with me.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.580
Or maybe she just
misses her mom.

09:40.420 --> 09:42.620
Oh my god, that's
why she was so bummed
about her birthday.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.420
It wasn't me,
it's her dead mom!

09:45.620 --> 09:46.960
Oh god, I'm horrible.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.290
You know what?
This whole thing
just feels wrong right now.

09:49.290 --> 09:50.580
Let's just bring
the presents back

09:50.580 --> 09:51.710
like I wanted to do
in the first place.

09:51.710 --> 09:53.540
Unless...

09:53.540 --> 09:55.500
What, you guys
have another idea?

09:55.500 --> 09:56.580
Totes.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.250
Here, we filled the tank
on number three.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.540
How do you think
Ms. Wilson got us
out of that ticket?

10:06.540 --> 10:09.420
I mean, the woman
was speeding without a license.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.790
Who knows how old people
do anything? I mean, my grandpa
used to steal my nose

10:12.790 --> 10:14.830
all the time, and I still
haven't figured that out.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.210
Your card got declined.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.790
Oh. Well, that's
okay, we'll just use
our emergency card.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.330
Oh, great,
we have one of those?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.500
No.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.830
Ms. Wilson, um, I'm so sorry
to ask, but would you mind
paying for gas?

10:28.830 --> 10:30.250
We don't have any cash.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.670
Neither do I.

10:31.670 --> 10:35.120
What? But you said you brought
500 bucks to gamble.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.420
I had to pay off the cop.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.330
That's how you got out of it?

10:40.330 --> 10:43.920
Well, it wasn't my first offer.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.960
Wait, so, how are we gonna
get to Vegas

10:48.960 --> 10:51.380
if we don't have any money
to pay for the gas?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.580
You already filled up
the tank, didn't you?

10:53.580 --> 10:57.790
-Yeah.
-What are you sayin'?
We make a run for it?

10:57.790 --> 11:02.000
On three.
One, two, three!

11:08.330 --> 11:10.670
What are you doing?
We had it!

11:17.580 --> 11:19.040
Are you sure
you don't have any money?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.250
(sighs)
None.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.250
Ms. Wilson, here,
give me your purse.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.170
Let's see.

11:26.460 --> 11:31.420
Butterscotch, butterscotch,
butterscotch... condom?

11:32.880 --> 11:35.120
Bernie was in Japan
during the war.

11:38.790 --> 11:42.670
Um... Sofia, if we are not
at that hotel in one hour,

11:42.670 --> 11:46.080
Ms. Wilson is gonna miss Bernie,
and then we're never gonna have
an ending to the love story

11:46.080 --> 11:48.170
of Bernie and--

11:48.170 --> 11:49.380
Ms. Wilson,
what's your first name?

11:49.380 --> 11:50.500
Bernice.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.330
Aw, Bernie and Bernice.
That's so cute.

11:54.330 --> 11:57.040
It's kinda weird,
but so cute!

11:57.040 --> 12:00.880
Ladies, you're not going
anywhere unless you pay
for the gas you pumped.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.620
And that corn dog.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.540
Oh my god!
The crappy globe!

12:11.540 --> 12:13.170
There's money
in the crappy globe!

12:13.170 --> 12:14.710
No, no, no, no!

12:14.710 --> 12:17.710
This is me and my mom's money.
I only brought it for good luck.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.170
Well, it's lucky
you brought it,

12:19.170 --> 12:21.330
'cause we need it
to get outta this dump!

12:23.170 --> 12:25.540
Gabi, look, I-- I know
that you and your mom

12:25.540 --> 12:27.380
planned to use that money
to go to New York and Paris,

12:27.380 --> 12:31.080
but maybe, just maybe,
you're meant to use it now.

12:31.080 --> 12:36.380
Honey, you can hang on
to some things forever
or move forward.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.670
Now bust that bank open!

12:45.420 --> 12:48.080
That's all the money
you saved since you were 15?

12:48.080 --> 12:50.460
I thought with interest
it would grow.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.580
In a real bank, Gabi,
a real bank!

12:55.120 --> 12:58.920
This is three seventy-five,
you owe... 38.06.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.080
Sir, look,
it's her 25th birthday,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.290
and her mom's not here
to see it.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.790
Do you think that,
maybe, you could cut us
a break?

13:05.790 --> 13:08.000
-38.06.
-What are you, dead inside?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.330
Ever since I quit dancing, yeah.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.540
Oh, well...
I guess I won't be
feelin' the Bern.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.170
Oh, yes, you will.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.210
Okay. All it takes is one.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.540
All it takes is one more.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.080
Okay, all it takes is--
What number are we on?

13:41.080 --> 13:43.540
-We're outta quarters.
-Dammit!

13:43.540 --> 13:46.120
So we used
all my mom's quarters,
and we're still stuck here?

13:46.120 --> 13:49.500
I know, Gabi,
I'm-- I'm so sorry.
I feel terrible.

13:49.500 --> 13:54.040
You feel terrible?
Third corn dog.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.750
Wait a minute.
What's that?

14:02.380 --> 14:05.750
Oh my god!
My mom taped a quarter
to the bottom!

14:05.750 --> 14:08.500
She knew I wasn't great
with money, so she must've
left me an extra one,

14:08.500 --> 14:10.120
so I could call her
in case of emergency.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.420
Least I have this quarter
to remember her by.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.210
Wait!

14:19.420 --> 14:22.540
(screaming)

14:22.540 --> 14:24.120
Thanks, Mom!

14:24.120 --> 14:25.960
(laughing)
Vegas, baby!

14:25.960 --> 14:27.960
I'm-- I'm driving.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.580
Okay, Ms. Wilson,
there's the honeymoon suite.
Are you ready?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.170
I need a drink.
Let's hit the bar.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.620
No, no!

14:40.620 --> 14:44.330
You can't go to the bar.
We only have... 20 minutes left.
We might miss Bernie.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.170
But what if he's dead?

14:46.170 --> 14:48.250
Or worse, still married?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.790
Come on, let's get hammered.

14:51.790 --> 14:57.080
No, no.
I know what's going on.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.000
Ms. Wilson, you're nervous.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.960
-So?
-There's nothing
to be nervous about.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.580
You don't look a day over 80,
and you have those dimples
no man can resist.

15:05.580 --> 15:08.080
And you've got that great
Crossfit body goin' on.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.290
Come on, let's knock.

15:09.290 --> 15:10.960
No!

15:10.960 --> 15:15.120
Ms. Wilson, a very smart woman
once said you can either
hold onto things forever,

15:15.120 --> 15:16.710
or move forward.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.920
Who told you that B.S.?

15:18.920 --> 15:22.290
(laughs)
Come on, let's bust down
this door,

15:22.290 --> 15:24.710
because the love
of your life might be waiting
on the other side.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.620
Bernie!

15:30.620 --> 15:33.080
You look fantastic!

15:34.500 --> 15:35.790
That's not Bernie.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.580
Close enough.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.120
Josh, what the hell
are you doing here?

15:41.120 --> 15:44.210
Well, I threw you a party,
but you hated it, so I figured
I'd make it up to you

15:44.210 --> 15:47.120
with presents.
So I went to your apartment
to bring them to you,

15:47.120 --> 15:49.210
but it turns out
you're in Vegas,
so I brought your presents here.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.380
My god, this is supposed
to be Bernie and Bernice's
suite,

15:52.380 --> 15:53.670
you're ruining everything!

15:55.040 --> 15:56.290
Should just
throw Elliot a party.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.330
Wait, how did you guys
get here so fast?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.750
Oh, we took Josh's
private jet.

16:05.750 --> 16:09.080
Had a couch in it,
free champagne, then a limo
to the hotel.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.880
Oo-hoo!
Oh, but it was all
for your birthday, baby.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.710
Hey, has an old guy
named Bernie knocked
on the door?

16:17.710 --> 16:20.790
And if he did,
how does he look?

16:20.790 --> 16:23.670
'Cause in '97, he was jacked!

16:25.120 --> 16:26.670
Gabi, what's going on?

16:26.670 --> 16:29.170
Twenty years ago,
Ms. Wilson made a pact
with a guy named Bernie,

16:29.170 --> 16:32.620
that if they were both single
on their 95th birthdays,
which is today,

16:32.620 --> 16:35.500
they would meet back here.
And now it's 10 minutes
to midnight,

16:35.500 --> 16:37.040
so nobody moves
until he shows up.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.040
But I have tickets
to Ms. Celine Dion.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.580
You and your tote, sit!

16:44.170 --> 16:46.960
Did you hear that?
My tote.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.210
Guys, it's 12:30.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.120
Maybe he took the stairs.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.040
I don't think Bernie's coming.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.250
(sigh)
Man... I can't believe
he didn't show.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.710
-Oh, it-- it's okay.
-No, it's not okay!

17:09.710 --> 17:11.040
I mean, this was your dream!

17:11.040 --> 17:12.710
You had a plan
for your 25th birth--

17:12.710 --> 17:14.670
your 95th birthday.

17:14.670 --> 17:16.750
It was supposed to be
the most special day
of your life.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.920
My mom and I--
You and Bernie should've
been together.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.210
I can't believe
it didn't happen!

17:21.210 --> 17:22.830
Gabi...

17:24.170 --> 17:25.920
It's not fair, Sofia.

17:25.920 --> 17:30.040
Sure, it would've been nice
to see Bernie again.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.210
But I got to drive,
and I got to Vegas.

17:34.210 --> 17:39.380
And I won a jackpot.
It's the best night
I've ever had!

17:39.380 --> 17:41.210
Really?

17:41.210 --> 17:43.120
Minus the corn dog.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.500
Life's about new memories.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.790
What do you say
we go make some?

17:48.790 --> 17:50.040
(knocking on door)

17:50.040 --> 17:51.460
(gasps)

17:55.620 --> 17:57.040
(gasps)

17:57.040 --> 17:58.620
Bernie?

17:58.620 --> 18:00.080
Bernice?

18:00.920 --> 18:03.120
You look fantastic!

18:03.120 --> 18:04.960
Oh, I'm--
I'm not Bernice.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.460
Close enough.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.790
Over here, Bernie.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.120
Oh, thank goodness.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.920
I never could've
handled that.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.880
Aww... still got
those dimples!

18:16.880 --> 18:19.580
-(laughs)
-Here, I brought you
some chocolates.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.170
Ohh.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.080
Thank God he's still jacked.

18:26.080 --> 18:30.960
It's... kinda crowded here,
can-- can we get outta here?

18:30.960 --> 18:33.040
Oh, hell, yes, let's do.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.000
Oh, maybe it'd be easier
if they got out?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.670
Out!

18:40.250 --> 18:45.210
Elliot, if we're both single
when we're 95, let's agree
to meet back here...

18:45.210 --> 18:47.250
and kill each other.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.120
I can't believe
he actually showed up.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.210
Yeah. Ms. Wilson got her dream.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.830
Gabi, when I went
to bring those gifts
to your apartment...

19:01.040 --> 19:03.620
I saw the card from your mom
from when you were 15.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.920
You did?

19:04.920 --> 19:08.380
Yeah. And look, I-- I know
I can't bring her back.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.920
But maybe I can give you guys
the trip you always dreamed of.

19:16.040 --> 19:21.000
Look... New York,
Paris, and Venice.

19:23.420 --> 19:26.460
That's everywhere
I wanted to go with my mom.
That's amazing.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.120
So what I'm hearing is...
maybe I'm kinda your hero?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.880
Maybe you kinda are.

19:37.750 --> 19:41.210
It's like Ms. Wilson said,
you gotta make new memories.

19:41.210 --> 19:45.250
Hey, you two,
can you get outta here?

19:50.830 --> 19:55.080
More butter?
Ha, ha, ha, mm-hm!

19:56.920 --> 20:00.080
More syrup?
Don't mind if I do!

20:00.080 --> 20:04.120
Whipped cream?
What do you think?

20:09.380 --> 20:11.960
I love Vegas!

20:11.960 --> 20:15.830
Yolande, it's nine
in the morning, are you
just getting in now?

20:15.830 --> 20:19.670
Me and these boots
have been out all night!

20:19.670 --> 20:23.250
Did you know they give you
free drinks when you gamble?

20:25.750 --> 20:29.120
-Here's me and Elliot
at Caesar's.
-Ohh!

20:29.120 --> 20:32.330
Here's me and Elliot
at the MGM Grand!

20:32.330 --> 20:34.830
-Uh-huh.
-Here's me and Elliot...

20:34.830 --> 20:36.120
at a chapel?

20:38.170 --> 20:41.670
Here's me
and Elliot slippin' rings
on each other's fingers.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.330
-Here's me and El--
-(gags)

20:46.750 --> 20:49.500
-Oh my damn!
-Hey, girls!

20:50.920 --> 20:52.880
Ooh, brekkie!

20:53.960 --> 20:56.170
Did Yolande tell you
how much fun we had?

20:56.170 --> 20:57.880
Oh, she sure did!

20:59.500 --> 21:01.080
Did she tell you

21:01.080 --> 21:05.000
Ms. Celine Dion asked me
where I got my tote?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.500
(laughs)

21:06.500 --> 21:08.670
Am I gonna have a good story
for Alan.

21:08.670 --> 21:09.750
(laughing)

21:14.420 --> 21:17.460
What's on my head?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.500
Uh-oh.
