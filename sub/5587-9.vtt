<i> a badass fighter pilot</i>

<i> thanks to the</i>
<i> cinematic masterpiece</i>
<i> that was</i> 'Top Gun,'

00:05.973 --> 00:08.674
<i> and no one loved it</i>
<i> more than my big bro.</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:11.176
You're handsome
and clear for takeoff.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.612
<i> Yeah, he was a real Maverick.</i>

00:13.614 --> 00:15.647
<i> His fighter jet</i>
<i> was our beat-up</i>
<i> station wagon,</i>

00:15.649 --> 00:18.117
<i> and his co-pilot,</i>
<i> my annoyed sister.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:21.754
Dear God,
you have been flipping
knobs for five minutes!

00:21.756 --> 00:22.888
Just go already.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.023
We ain't going anywhere

00:24.025 --> 00:26.792

<i> my brother's</i>

Behold.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.510
Junior ROTC.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.378
That's like pre-pre-
military training.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.447
Dude, I think they give you
free camo when you sign up.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.449
Sweet. Now I can hide
from my mean cousin

00:50.451 --> 00:52.785

my uncle's farm.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.490
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:58.492 --> 00:59.091
Morning, gentlemen.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.160
Interested in joining up
with Junior ROTC?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.995
I need able-bodied leaders
with fire in their bellies

01:02.997 --> 01:04.763
looking to make
a difference.

01:04.765 --> 01:05.864
That's so weird.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.434
I'm an able-bodied person
with a fiery belly

01:08.436 --> 01:11.503
who's ready to fly your jets
and push your envelopes

01:11.505 --> 01:12.538
and play shirtless
beach volleyball.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.207
What?
It's proven to be
a nice diversion

01:15.209 --> 01:17.342
from the pressures
of flight school.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.043
What's your

01:18.045 --> 01:20.679

You want to go hustle
some suckers at air hockey?

02:09.663 --> 02:12.731
I'm old with a wallet
full of cash.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.167
How do I play
this ice ping-pong?

<i> After we hustled some kids</i>

Howdy, folks.

Thank you very much.
That's very kind.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.374
Oh, stop.
Thank you so much.

02:55.376 --> 03:01.346
Folks, who would like to live
in the condo of their dreams?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.381
For two months
out of the year.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.917
I'm talking about
timeshares, y'all.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.618
Question.
Yes, sir.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.987
If we decide
not to buy today,

03:08.989 --> 03:10.322
do we still get
the movie tickets?

03:10.324 --> 03:13.692
That's the deal, but I can
promise you this, sir,

03:13.694 --> 03:14.493
at the end of today,

03:14.495 --> 03:16.662
you're not gonna be thinking
about movie tickets.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.530
You're gonna be
thinking about

03:18.532 --> 03:20.632

<i> Pops was young at heart.</i>

is it sunny year-round

03:46.694 --> 03:51.296
the women outnumber
the gentlemen three to one.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.598
Sold!

03:54.068 --> 03:55.267
Oh, my God.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.803
Pops actually bought
a place in Florida?

03:57.805 --> 03:59.338
Right?
It's a nightmare.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.441
Hello? We're gonna have
our own beach condo.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.443
Think of all the
spring breaks,

04:04.445 --> 04:05.177
the Latin guys,

04:05.179 --> 04:08.914
the romantic
walks on the beach
with the Latin guys.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.848
Why do I come to you?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.650
You need to chill.
It's a timeshare.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.884
He'll be gone
two months a year.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.288
Everyone knows a timeshare
is a gateway property.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.889
Two months becomes six.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.624
Six become a year.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.325
And a year turns
into forever.

04:20.327 --> 04:24.029
So? Pops is old,
and that's what all
old people do.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.698
Stop saying that.
Pops isn't old.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.332
He's 80.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.568
Who cares? I measure
age in spirit.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.437
Well, I measure age
by when you were born.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.905
And for Pops,
that's 1903.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.109
Holy crap.
Seriously?
Oh, yeah.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.445
Shut up!
Everyone, shut up!

04:40.447 --> 04:41.580
I got Barry news.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.781
Everybody stop talking.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.216
What is it,
snuggle monster?

04:44.218 --> 04:45.651
I joined
the military.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.985
Boom!
What's that now?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.720
Good stuff.
What branch?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.589
The one with the
planes and boats.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.757
You're welcome,
America.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.192
I just need you to sign
this permission slip.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.327
Absolutely not.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.295
Being a soldier
is number one

04:56.297 --> 04:59.564
on my list of jobs
too dangerous
for my children.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.365
List?
What list?

05:00.367 --> 05:01.533
Oh, God.
Not the list.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.935
I knew one day
my kids would
join the workforce,

05:03.937 --> 05:07.372
so like a good mother,
I compiled a list
of occupations

05:07.374 --> 05:09.074
that are strictly
off-limits.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.176
Why can't I be
a construction worker?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.978
Eating lunch on a
suspended beam

05:12.980 --> 05:15.080
with your legs
dangling down?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.948
No way.
No pro sports?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.550
Except golf,
but you can't
drive around

05:18.552 --> 05:20.152
in one of those buggies
with no seat belt.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.988
Astronaut?
Your sensitive
tummy at zero g?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.256
Deli guy.
Meat slicer.

05:24.258 --> 05:25.324
Government clerk.
Paper cut.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.759
Robot technician.
Robot uprising.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
This is nuts.
Pops was in the army.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.864
And he is a hero.
Couldn't be prouder of him.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.566
But I want
to be a hero.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.834
And you can be...

05:35.836 --> 05:37.102
As an orthodontist
or a maitre d'

05:37.104 --> 05:42.107
or as one of those guys
who tests pillows
for softness.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.810
ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep.</i>
<i> All hope was lost.</i>

05:44.812 --> 05:46.144
I'll sign it.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.045
<i> And then found.</i>

05:47.047 --> 05:49.581
Really?
I did ROTC.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.182
It changed my life.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.751
And I fully support this
as long as your mother
never finds out.

05:52.753 --> 05:57.489
And one more thing.
If you do this,
there's no quitting.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.491
I mean it.
10-4, good buddy.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.759
That's trucker talk.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.294
Aye-aye, matey.

06:02.296 --> 06:03.929
That's pirate.

06:04.498 --> 06:04.830
Hmm.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.565
ADULT ADAM: <i> While Barry</i>
<i> was committed to the army,</i>

06:06.567 --> 06:08.767
<i> I was committed</i>
<i> to showing Pops</i>

06:08.769 --> 06:10.102
<i> just how young he was.</i>

06:10.104 --> 06:12.471
ADAM: There he is,
rockin' the new duds.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.739
You dig 'em,
homey?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.140
They're roomy
where I need them,

06:15.142 --> 06:17.042
but kind of drafty
where I don't.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.810
Perfect! Let's go
hit the town

06:18.812 --> 06:21.613
and live it up while
we're still young.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.414
What the...

06:22.416 --> 06:24.282
How did your Zubaz
get so high?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.251
They ride up.
I don't know.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.919
They have a mind
of their own.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.755
Now all you can see
is 'Frankie says'.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.522
No one will know to relax.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.291
Who is this Frankie,
and why does he
want me to relax?

06:33.293 --> 06:37.796
All you need to know
is you look half your age
in those Zubaz pants.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.398
Way too young
for Florida.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.533
Oh, so that's what
this is about.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.268
Kiddo, it's just
two months.

06:43.270 --> 06:47.172
Two months
in middle-school years
is like a decade.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.373
Come on, pal.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.008
Pops says relax.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.544
Don't you use that
catchphrase against me!

06:52.546 --> 06:54.513
I will not relax!

06:54.715 --> 06:55.380
Where you going?

06:55.382 --> 06:58.784
To my other grandpa,
the one who'd never leave me.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.317
Pop Pop?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.852
You really want
to replace me

07:00.854 --> 07:02.721
with that spiteful
old bastard?

07:02.723 --> 07:05.357
Already done.
Have fun in Florida.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.926
I'll be
living it up here
with Pop Pop

07:07.928 --> 07:10.695
having crazy
amounts of fun.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.431
This is fun.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.765
So much fun.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.933
Shh. I'm reading
the stocks.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.736

ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep.</i>
<i> This was my grandfather Ben.</i>

07:17.738 --> 07:20.505
<i> He was the anti-Pops</i>
<i> who could never catch a break.</i>

07:20.507 --> 07:23.708
Damn IBM! I should
have invested.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.043
I'd be a millionaire.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.045
Instead, I lost it
all on Cigaroos.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.148
What's that?
Cigarettes for kids.

07:30.150 --> 07:30.982
Yeah.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.184
They had
a spokesbunny.

07:32.186 --> 07:35.554
Isn't that adorable?
It was a slam dunk!

07:35.923 --> 07:37.823
ADULT ADAM: <i> As I was</i>
<i> bonding with Pop Pop,</i>

Barry Norman Goldberg
reporting for duty, sir!

07:41.695 --> 07:43.595
Son, I told you three times.
I know you're here.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.398
Question. When do we get
our nicknames assigned,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
'cause I'm thinking
I'm gonna be Sky Shark.

07:48.402 --> 07:48.967
I call Sky Tiger.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.102
Dude, I told you
Sky Tiger was my nickname.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.371
No one's Sky Tiger.
I'm Sky Shark.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.606
There can't be
two skies.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.740
I was kind of thinking
Thunder Shark.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.310
Oh, that's good!
No, bro!
I'm the shark!

07:58.312 --> 08:00.412
(ALL SHOUTING)

08:00.414 --> 08:01.012
Enough!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.348
Instead of nicknames,
how about this.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.249
Give me 20 push-ups.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.618
If my body's already
in peak physical condition,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.620
can I pass
and practice instead?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.489
Practice what?
Volleyball.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.823
You know, for when
we go to the beach

08:11.825 --> 08:13.158
and flex our young,
glistening bodies.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.359
I'm kind of
body-conscious,

08:14.361 --> 08:16.228
so I'm not gonna pop off
my shirt at the beach,

08:16.230 --> 08:17.729
if that's cool.
He's got an outie.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.531
Shh!
There's no volleyball.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.067
Son, if you're
not here to work,
you're worthless to me.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.002
But I was
led to believe
I'm special.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.606
You want special treatment?
Drop and give me 40!

08:30.077 --> 08:33.078
Hey! How was
training, big guy?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.346
Captain Wallace
says I'm, like,

08:34.348 --> 08:36.815
better than Rambo,
the real one.
They're friends.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.518
Well, I'm just proud
that you're sticking with it.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.353
Oh, yeah.
Stick-to-it Barry.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.555
That's what they call me.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.191
Mom!

08:46.193 --> 08:48.293
Dad secretly signed
a permission slip

08:48.295 --> 08:49.694
to get me
in basic training.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.364
Now I need to have you
secretly get me out of it.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.565
What?
Shh!

08:53.567 --> 08:54.266
Dad won't let me quit,

08:54.268 --> 08:57.135
but Captain Wallace
is super demanding
and angry.

08:57.137 --> 08:57.936
He called me worthless.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.804
Are you (BLEEP)
kidding me?

08:59.806 --> 09:01.907
I know. Right?
Worthless?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.375
Well, obviously,
he's never seen you

09:03.377 --> 09:05.610
ride a tandem bicycle
with your mother.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.811
I was doing
most of the pedaling.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.980
Are you sure
he called you worthless?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.448
Maybe he called
you wonderful?

09:10.450 --> 09:13.351
No. You have to get
me out of this, ma.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.454
Unless you want me
to fly secret missions

09:16.456 --> 09:17.689
to dangerous
foreign lands.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.991
You can't go
on a secret mission.

09:19.993 --> 09:20.959
They won't let you
call home,

09:20.961 --> 09:23.695
and they don't know
what kind of cheese
binds you up.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.997
So, you'll help?
Don't worry,
Snuggy-Boo.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.898
I'll get you out.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.001
Now, drop
and give me 20.

09:30.170 --> 09:30.902
Huggies. (CHUCKLES)

09:30.904 --> 09:35.373
ADULT ADAM: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> Beverly Goldberg went to war.</i>

09:36.043 --> 09:38.310
ADULT ADAM: <i> While I was</i>
<i> still upset about our fight,</i>

09:38.312 --> 09:41.079
<i> Pops was ready to extend</i>
<i> an olive branch.</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:43.214
Hey, sweetheart.
You seen Adam?

09:43.216 --> 09:46.551
I got him one of those
Atari-Nintendo games.

09:46.553 --> 09:50.355
It's just like
the red-car, blue-car game
that we play at the arcade.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.692
Aww, that's so cute.
But he's hanging with Pop Pop.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.460
Pop-pop? I thought
he was bluffing.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.028
You can always
hang with me,

09:57.030 --> 09:58.296
you know, make
the little nerd jealous.

09:58.298 --> 10:02.834
It'd be pretty damn
petty of me to use you
as some pawn.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.135
Oh, I'm totally cool
with it.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.438
We can, like,
go to the mall.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.407
So, this is all a ploy
to get me to buy you stuff?

10:09.409 --> 10:12.444
See? We get each other.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.745
I'll drive.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.681
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Erica</i>
<i> and Pops had formed</i>
<i> an alliance,</i>

10:16.683 --> 10:18.783
<i> my mom was waging war.</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:20.318
You, sir!

10:20.687 --> 10:21.353
We need to talk.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.854
Mrs. Goldberg,
I told you.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.423
Yelling hours
are between
9:00 and 12:00.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.725
This is
my lunch break.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.193
Eat your tater tots, Earl.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.694
I'm here for him.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.929
What's happening
right now?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.430
This is
Beverly Goldberg.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.465
She's the Delta Force
of mothers.

10:33.467 --> 10:37.802
And I'm here to tell you
that Barry will not be
returning to your course.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.738
And I'm here to tell you
that your husband called

10:39.740 --> 10:40.972
and said under
no circumstances

10:40.974 --> 10:43.408
should I let your son
weasel out of this.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.275
He called?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.677
Oh, this just got good.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.878
BEVERLY: Okay, then.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.313
Well, I have demands.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.915
Instead of yelling,
you will motivate my baby

10:50.917 --> 10:52.717
with kindness and
encouragement.

10:52.719 --> 10:56.388
And you will never, ever
call him worthless again.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.390
Well, considering
you're asking me

10:58.392 --> 11:01.960
to undo years
of proven and effective
military training,

11:01.962 --> 11:03.128
the answer is no.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.629
BEVERLY: Or is it yes?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.231
According to the
school handbook,

11:06.233 --> 11:07.932
any parent is permitted
on school grounds

11:07.934 --> 11:09.834
to tend to the well-being
of their child.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.904
Oop.
That gives me
the legal right

11:12.906 --> 11:15.240
to be my son's
wingmom.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.341
Uh-oh.
Wingmom?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.376
Wingmom.
That's not a thing.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.244
Oh, it is.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.912
I'll see you
at 0900.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.681
No, you won't.
Yes, she will.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.850
That woman isn't setting
one foot in my class,

11:25.852 --> 11:26.618
and you know why?

11:26.620 --> 11:28.753
'Cause it's absurd
and unrealistic

11:28.755 --> 11:30.655
and will never happen
on my watch.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.792
Due to circumstances
both beyond my control
and beyond reason,

11:33.794 --> 11:38.596
I'd like to welcome
a new ridiculous addition
to our class.

11:38.732 --> 11:39.931
It's me.
What?

11:39.933 --> 11:42.701
You were supposed
to get me out of this,
not join me!

11:42.703 --> 11:45.804
But now we can
both feel the need,

11:45.806 --> 11:47.772
the need for speed.

11:47.774 --> 11:48.473
Together.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.308
I feel that need alone,
not with my mom!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.178
I promise
you won't even know
I'm here, Little Schmoo.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.345
(ALL LAUGH)
Little Schmoo.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.680
Now that should
be your code name.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.516
No! It's Sky Shark.
That better not stick.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.818
Infantilizing, bro!

11:59.820 --> 12:02.153
Oh, no. The tastemakers
have spoken.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.421
It's sticking!

12:03.423 --> 12:05.790
ADULT ADAM:
<i> With my mom</i>
<i> officially enlisted,</i>

12:05.792 --> 12:06.725
<i> I had officially signed up</i>

12:06.727 --> 12:10.028
<i> for a day</i>
<i> of fun and laughter</i>
<i> with Pop Pop.</i>

12:10.630 --> 12:12.664
Hey, where's all
the loose change?

12:12.666 --> 12:15.100
You promised me
pocketfuls of quarters.

12:15.102 --> 12:15.700
Hmm.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.837
While we're here,
might as well play
a few games.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.471
What do you think?

12:19.473 --> 12:21.272
The only game I played
when I was a kid

12:21.274 --> 12:24.242
was stop the Irish
from stealing our jobs.

12:25.178 --> 12:25.977
Okay.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.979
There's got to be
coins in the fountain.

12:27.981 --> 12:28.646
I'll hold your legs.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.550
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My playdate with Pop Pop</i>
<i> couldn't get any worse...</i>

12:32.552 --> 12:33.251
Holy balls!

12:33.253 --> 12:35.220
ADULT ADAM: <i> ...Until</i>
<i> we ran into my ex.</i>

12:35.222 --> 12:37.689
What's he doing here?
How's my hair?

12:37.691 --> 12:38.556
Looks like
a Chia thing.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.592
Shut up and laugh like
I said something funny.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.127
Since when
are you funny?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.729
(LAUGHS)

12:46.066 --> 12:47.632
So fun.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.502
Oh. Hey, Pops.

12:50.804 --> 12:51.936
Adam.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.439
Didn't expect
to see you here...

12:54.975 --> 12:55.740
With her.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.574
Yeah, I'd love
to chat,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.443
but Pops and I are
hitting up Benetton.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.078
Need some resort
wear to be ready

13:00.080 --> 13:01.813
to jet down to Florida
with my main man.

13:01.815 --> 13:05.750
Well, I'm happy that you found
someone to spend time with.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.452
Oh, this one's the best.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.920
Hope you're
having fun, too.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.555
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
So much fun.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.225
Today, I watched Pop Pop
pick up his prescription

13:14.227 --> 13:15.527
and berate
the pharmacist

13:15.529 --> 13:18.463
while I played
with the blood
pressure machine.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.264
Classic us.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.466
Ah, I see what's
going on here.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.369
You're only
hanging out with me
to hurt his feelings.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.170
(CHUCKLES)
Well done.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.907
In your face, Al.
I'm his favorite
grandpa now.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.475
Not a competition, Ben.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.376
Oh, yes. It sure is.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.744
I've been waiting
for this for years.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.513
You think you're so great
with your pockets full
of paper money

13:35.515 --> 13:36.681
and your genuine kindness.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.949
Well, no more.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.150
I'm the Pops now.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.285
You're not the Pops.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.152
I'll always be
the Pops.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.222
No, no. I'm taking it
because I hate being
called Pop Pop.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.025
Then pick another
name, like, uh...

13:47.027 --> 13:48.726
Poppy.
Oh, hell, no.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.861
Pap Pap.
(GROANS)

13:49.863 --> 13:50.728
Paw Paw.
No, no, no.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.865
Face it. I finally beat you,
and this little weirdo
is my prize.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.334
Enough! I've had it
with both of you.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.037
No one gets
to be my Pops!

14:00.307 --> 14:02.674
And for the record,
I still won.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.541
WALLACE: Come on, Goldberg.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.577
The only way
out of my class
is over that wall,

14:05.579 --> 14:06.444
you lazy sack of nothing.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.013
Don't you listen to him.
You're a sack of everything!

14:09.015 --> 14:11.583
You need to push
that lazy, worthless body,

14:11.585 --> 14:13.218
or you'll be
a loser forever.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.487
Your body is a sweet treasure,
and you're a winner!

14:16.489 --> 14:17.956
Say,
"I'm a winner!"

14:17.958 --> 14:20.058
(GROANS)
I can't.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.993
Too hard!
WALLACE: You don't know hard.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.762
Now stand up and start
from the beginning.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.363
Oh, no, no.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.699
He's done. Come with me
and rest up, baby.

14:27.701 --> 14:28.366
Really?
Really?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.201
Really?
Barry has low
energy today

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
because he overslept
and didn't get a complete
breakfast,

14:32.873 --> 14:35.840
but I have raisins,
so we're good.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.342
Oh, are we, now?

14:37.344 --> 14:37.942
We are.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.410
The school manual
clearly states

14:39.412 --> 14:42.313
that nutritional health
is one of the most...
Fine.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.416
Then everyone else
will attack the course
except for Goldberg,

14:45.418 --> 14:48.519
who's gonna sit on the side
and eat his box of raisins.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.322
Sir, yes, sir!
It's nature's candy, sir!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.690
Yes. I've had raisins.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.759
I can't believe
these came from
grapes, sir.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.895
I wonder who came up
with the idea for them, sir.

14:56.897 --> 14:57.795
Are you done?
No, sir!

14:57.797 --> 15:01.232
Permission to share
a few plump raisins
with my platoon, sir!

15:01.234 --> 15:01.799
Denied!

15:01.801 --> 15:04.002
Just go sit on
the bleachers
and shut up.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.804
The rest of you,
move it!

15:06.806 --> 15:09.507
Feels pretty good
having a wingmom, huh?

15:09.509 --> 15:14.212
Mmm. The sun makes them
taste so sweet.
(CHUCKLES)

15:15.081 --> 15:17.982
Hey, there, soldier.
How was your day?

15:17.984 --> 15:20.551
Tough as balls,
but you were right, Dad.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.686
It feels good
to stick it out.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.889
It does.
I bet you're starving.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.925
How about a snack?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.527
Raisin?
Mom, he knows.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.461
He knows?
He knows.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.063
Wait.
Do you know?
Wingmom?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.798
He knows.
How do you know?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.599
I have my sources!

15:34.601 --> 15:35.667
What?
Captain Wallace tattled?

15:35.669 --> 15:38.870
Bevy, how could you go behind
my back and try and help him?

15:38.872 --> 15:42.473
How could you sign that
permission slip behind
my back?

15:42.475 --> 15:43.708
Because it's important.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.544
ROTC was the only way
I could go to college.

15:46.546 --> 15:50.014
It's literally
the first thing in my life
I ever saw through.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.117
And thank God I did,
because the guy I was before

15:53.119 --> 15:56.721
wouldn't have had a shot
with you or any of this.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.856
Look, look,
you guys both win.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.125
Thanks to mom,
I get to protect my country

16:01.127 --> 16:02.694
in a way that suits
my lifestyle,

16:02.696 --> 16:05.430
being a hero
without working hard.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.199
Well...

16:08.201 --> 16:10.268
Mission accomplished.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.910
Oh, so good.

16:21.715 --> 16:22.947
ADULT ADAM: <i> Officially</i>
<i> grandfather-less,</i>

16:22.949 --> 16:28.019
<i> I decided to go</i>
<i> to my favorite place</i>
<i> in the world to cheer up.</i>

16:28.021 --> 16:29.020
(ADAM SIGHS)

16:29.022 --> 16:33.891
Right there with you, Pac.
You can't rely on anyone.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.029
I got next game.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.932
Not talking to me,
huh?

16:40.934 --> 16:42.567
All right.
Let's play for it.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.436
If I beat you, then you
got to listen to me.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.573
If not, I'm gone.
Deal?

16:48.942 --> 16:51.209
You? Play me?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.945
At Ms. Pac-man?
My best game?

16:53.947 --> 16:56.180
Let's just say
your old grandpa

16:56.182 --> 17:00.184
may have some skills
that might surprise you.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.593
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was a game of legend.</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:09.694
<i> Our entire relationship</i>
<i> was on the line.</i>

17:09.696 --> 17:14.766
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i> Pops played that machine like</i>
<i> he never played it before.</i>

17:14.768 --> 17:18.169
Ha! I did it!
I win!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.704
Actually, you lost.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.538
Well, that's crazy.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.342
My angry ghosts killed
that pac-woman over and over.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.611
You're not the ghosts.
I'm not the ghosts?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.147
You're the Pac-woman.
I'm the Pac-woman?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.948
You're the Pac-woman.

17:30.950 --> 17:35.920
Well, (CLEARS THROAT)
I guess it's goodbye.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.622
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As I was losing my wingman,</i>

17:37.624 --> 17:41.292
<i> Barry was ready</i>
<i> for another day</i>
<i> with his wingmom.</i>

17:41.294 --> 17:43.661
Mom, ROTC's in
20 minutes.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.030
Why aren't you dressed
in your camo sweater?

17:46.032 --> 17:48.066
Honey, I'm not going.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.000
But you are.
Alone.

17:49.002 --> 17:52.503
What?
You never leave your wingman,
and you're my wingmom.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.306
Here. I want to
show you something.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.576
This is a picture of your dad
at his ROTC graduation.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.445
Who does
he look like to you?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.980
<i> (TOP GUN</i> ANTHEM PLAYS)
Me.

18:02.982 --> 18:06.084
Look, your dad had nothing
growing up,

18:06.086 --> 18:08.252
but he was able to make
so much of himself

18:08.254 --> 18:10.421
because he wasn't
a quitter.

18:10.423 --> 18:15.526
I think I protect you so much,
I've turned you into one.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.331
That's why I'm ripping up
my list of dangerous jobs.

18:20.333 --> 18:24.302
Whoa.
Does this mean those jobs
are no longer off-limits?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.538
What you want to be in life
is up to you,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.208
no matter how scary
it is for me.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.811
Even a trapeze artist?
Don't push it.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.153
Goldberg...

18:42.155 --> 18:44.555
We don't normally say this
in the military, but...

18:44.557 --> 18:48.526
Where's your mother?
I'm flying solo today,
Captain.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.063
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> even without a wingmom,</i>

18:52.065 --> 18:53.831
<i> Barry could still soar</i>
<i> on his own.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:56.534
<i> As for me, when Pops</i>
<i> walked out of that arcade,</i>

18:56.536 --> 18:59.103
<i> I realized I could never</i>
<i> fly as high without him.</i>

18:59.105 --> 19:01.906
I've been informed that you're
a sucker for a sales pitch,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.008
so I figured you may want
to sit for this.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.445
Depends
what you're selling.
Us.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.383
By a show of hands,
how many of you fine folks

19:12.385 --> 19:15.586
have a grandson
who you've helped raise?

19:17.924 --> 19:21.692
And how many of you
are willing to forgive
said grandson

19:21.694 --> 19:24.395
for acting like
a selfish putz?

19:25.865 --> 19:28.766
'Cause the truth is,
no matter where you live,

19:28.768 --> 19:33.070
you'll always be my hero,
always be my best friend,

19:33.072 --> 19:35.039
always be my Pops.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.308
Sold.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.779
ADULT ADAM: <i> And that's</i>
<i> how I made peace</i>
<i> with my Pops.</i>

19:41.781 --> 19:43.447
<i> Sometimes it takes</i>
<i> almost losing someone</i>

19:43.449 --> 19:47.251
<i> to make you realize</i>
<i> just how much you need them.</i>

19:47.253 --> 19:48.920
<i> As for Pop Pop,</i>
<i> he'd always be</i>

19:48.922 --> 19:51.556
<i> the kind of grandfather</i>
<i> who didn't need much,</i>

19:51.558 --> 19:52.657
<i> but deep down inside,</i>

19:52.659 --> 19:53.891
<i> I knew that he still</i>
<i> needed me.</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:57.528
<i> And, to be honest,</i>
<i> I needed him, too.</i>

19:58.198 --> 20:01.165
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about the people we love.</i>

20:01.167 --> 20:02.366
<i> They're there at our lowest...</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:04.969
Well done, boys.
Only one thing to do now.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.538
Yeah, there is!
ALL: Yeah!

20:07.540 --> 20:10.808
<i> ...And they're there</i>
<i> when we're flying high,</i>

20:10.810 --> 20:14.612
<i> helping us celebrate</i>
<i> our biggest victories.</i>

20:30.430 --> 20:31.929
<i> Truth is you can</i>
<i> win any battle</i>

20:31.931 --> 20:34.632
<i> when your family's</i>
<i> got your back,</i>

20:34.634 --> 20:36.167
<i> 'cause no matter</i>
<i> what life throws at you,</i>

20:36.169 --> 20:39.637
<i> it's easy for a Maverick</i>
<i> when he's got Goose</i>
<i> at his side.</i>

20:39.639 --> 20:41.038
Winner!
Dang it!

20:41.040 --> 20:44.909
That's life in
the fast lane, kiddo.

20:48.781 --> 20:52.250
ADAM: <i> How many girls</i>
<i> do you think you've</i>
<i> dated in your life?</i>

20:52.252 --> 20:54.518
<i> Too numerous</i>
<i> to mention.</i>

20:55.989 --> 20:57.788
Sir! I figured it out.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.157
I know why you were so mad
at my nicknames.

21:00.159 --> 21:00.925
They weren't
good enough.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.159
Lucky for you,
I got some more.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.962
I was very clear.
No call signs,
no nicknames.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.697
But what about
sky monkey?
No.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.499
Air dragon? Air jordan?
No. No.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.434
Thunder hornet?
Sky dagger?
No. My God.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.636
Sky monkey.
You already said that.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.070
Wolf man.
Iron beagle?
No! No.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.506
Mach nine?
Mock turtleneck?
No. No.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.775
Handsome Barry?
Tall Barry?
No. No.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.577
Applesauce?
Yes! That's the one!

21:19.579 --> 21:23.648
Applesauce.
You are applesauce.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.181
No!
Oh, yes.

21:24.183 --> 21:27.918
That's just filler.
I was saying that so you could
warm up to Sky Shark.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.420
Pick Sky Shark!
