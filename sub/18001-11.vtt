00:08.834 --> 00:10.391
<i>Did you guys ever see the odd couple?</i>

00:10.504 --> 00:12.173
<i>- I love the odd couple.
- If two superheroes</i>

00:12.207 --> 00:13.608
had to live together,

00:13.643 --> 00:16.151
which would be the
oddest couple of all time?

00:16.184 --> 00:17.658
- Hmm.
- Ooh.

00:17.693 --> 00:20.327
I mean, isn't Batman-Joker
the obvious one?

00:20.361 --> 00:21.764
- Superheroes!
- All right!

00:21.799 --> 00:23.502
Superman-Batman seems to be...

00:23.537 --> 00:25.479
you know, they look like they
would probably butt heads.

00:25.514 --> 00:26.888
Mike, I know you've seen it.

00:26.922 --> 00:28.389
- Yes, of course.
- Come on, school him.

00:28.423 --> 00:31.559
I would do Human Torch and Aquaman.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.871
- See how easy it is?
- Right?

00:33.905 --> 00:35.174
All right, come on.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.376
All right, what about...

00:37.411 --> 00:39.654
Oh, man.

00:39.689 --> 00:41.025
Look at him thinking.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.195
You can hear the wheels churning in there.

00:43.230 --> 00:45.533
You can hear the birds chirping.

00:45.568 --> 00:49.078
All right, how about Captain
America and Swamp Thing?

00:49.113 --> 00:50.682
Okay, on the right track. Why?

00:50.716 --> 00:53.756
Captain America... upstanding citizen,

00:53.790 --> 00:55.191
seems like maybe a neat freak.

00:55.225 --> 00:57.894
- Doesn't live in a swamp.
- [Laughter]

00:57.928 --> 00:59.696
Doesn't live in a swamp.

00:59.731 --> 01:01.264
Swamp Thing, you know...

01:01.298 --> 01:05.441
- Does live in a swamp. 
- [Laughter]

01:05.476 --> 01:07.944
[Heroic music]

01:07.979 --> 01:09.950

01:38.772 --> 01:42.046
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.350
The only show that'll
carry you around like Hodor.

01:45.385 --> 01:47.354
- I'm your host, Kevin Smith.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:47.388 --> 01:48.958
- Walt Flanagan.
- Mike Zapcic.

01:48.993 --> 01:50.662
- Ming Chen.
- What's been going on

01:50.697 --> 01:52.498
in the fat man's comic
books store this week?

01:52.532 --> 01:54.101
What would you say if I told you

01:54.135 --> 02:00.280
one of the greatest toy mysteries
of all time was solved?

02:04.485 --> 02:06.185
- Good afternoon, guys.
- Hey, how you doing?

02:06.219 --> 02:07.586
- How's it going 
- Good.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.656
<i>I got one of the rarest Star Wars</i>

02:09.691 --> 02:12.096
action figures in existence.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.431
- Really?
- Yes.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.767
You can accurately say "holy grail"

02:15.801 --> 02:17.103
for this item, hands down.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.743
You gonna show us?

02:18.777 --> 02:21.078
Yes. Ready?

02:21.113 --> 02:22.915
Let's see.

02:22.949 --> 02:24.951
Wow, is that what I think it is?

02:24.986 --> 02:28.191
This is a rocket-firing
Boba Fett action figure

02:28.226 --> 02:29.560
from Kenner toys.

02:29.594 --> 02:32.064
No way. These are not supposed to exist.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.413
Why is it not supposed to exist?

02:41.448 --> 02:44.484
<i>Battlestar Galactica made
a toy, and it shot a missile,</i>

02:44.518 --> 02:47.288
and a child breathed it in, and he died.

02:47.323 --> 02:50.392
And so a Kenner attorney
said, "we can't have this,

02:50.426 --> 02:53.766
because it's going to be a
swallowing risk for kids."

02:53.801 --> 02:55.135
So that's why this got canceled.

02:55.170 --> 02:57.338
This one was just about to be released.

02:57.373 --> 02:59.507
- How did you get this?
- This actually came

02:59.541 --> 03:02.309
from an engineer at Kenner Toys.

03:02.343 --> 03:05.077
He just kept it in his
drawer for all these years.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.610
This is crazy.

03:06.645 --> 03:10.247
The crown jewel in
the lost toys of history.

03:10.282 --> 03:12.016
So rare that, until now,

03:12.051 --> 03:13.818
- it was, like, urban legend.
- Oh, yeah.

03:13.852 --> 03:15.852
Up until that point in the '70s,

03:15.887 --> 03:18.189
you could endanger a child through toys

03:18.224 --> 03:19.591
as much as you wanted.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.695
Nobody really ever thought twice about it,

03:21.731 --> 03:24.331
but I had, for my entire childhood,

03:24.366 --> 03:26.799
the Boba Fett that
didn't shoot a rocket out,

03:26.834 --> 03:28.301
and I turned out just fine.

03:28.335 --> 03:29.588
I mean, you know, I'm a little heavy.

03:29.588 --> 03:30.599
Maybe I would've been thinner

03:30.753 --> 03:32.254
if I had a rocket-firing
one, but that's about it.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.249
You would've had to walk over

03:33.249 --> 03:34.934
after you fired it, go get
the missile, put it back in.

03:34.934 --> 03:37.633
The exercise, exactly! I
would've been a healthier kid.

03:38.896 --> 03:40.365
Was he your favorite character?

03:40.399 --> 03:42.001
Yeah, I mean, just
look. Look at his mask.

03:42.035 --> 03:43.535
His eyes are just looking right at you.

03:43.569 --> 03:45.069
Don't mess with Fett.

03:45.103 --> 03:47.373
Why do you think Boba
Fett has lasted so long

03:47.408 --> 03:49.476
as the coolest, most badass character

03:49.510 --> 03:51.178
<i>out of the Star Wars?</i>

03:51.213 --> 03:53.687
It's the design of
that costume is so badass.

03:53.721 --> 03:55.688
- He was the coolest
- Looking bounty hunter

03:55.722 --> 03:57.489
the Wookiee scalps, right?

03:57.524 --> 03:59.223
The Wookiee scalps are cool,
yeah, hanging off his belt.

03:59.257 --> 04:01.021
You could get a badass
rep around your neighborhood

04:01.055 --> 04:02.655
if you were walking around
with, like, squirrel scalps

04:02.689 --> 04:05.892
on your belt. [Laughter]

04:05.926 --> 04:08.195
If that figure wasn't Boba Fett...

04:08.230 --> 04:10.698
let's say it was a Lobot...

04:10.733 --> 04:13.371
Lando Calrissian's bald
buddy with the headphones.

04:13.405 --> 04:16.440
Would it be as sought after?

04:16.474 --> 04:20.279
- No. Lobot wore a blouse.
- [Laughter]

04:20.314 --> 04:23.012
Right then and there you're
gonna have a hard time.

04:23.046 --> 04:24.846
I can't imagine why that
would be worth something,

04:24.880 --> 04:28.620
but Boba Fett still maintains
an insane amount of popularity.

04:28.654 --> 04:31.620
You know, nobody's sitting
there going, "bossk forever,"

04:31.654 --> 04:33.787
or "I'm an IG-88 booster."

04:33.821 --> 04:35.787
You know, it all comes down to Boba Fett.

04:35.822 --> 04:37.887
Who's that tubby guy with
the bandages around his head?

04:37.921 --> 04:39.221
All: Dengar.

04:39.256 --> 04:40.757
That was my hero when I was a kid.

04:40.791 --> 04:43.126
The only fat man in the Star Wars universe.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.060
I said, "mom, I want to
be Dengar when I grow up."

04:45.094 --> 04:46.527
You already are.

04:46.561 --> 04:48.794
[Laughter]

04:48.828 --> 04:50.627
You'll see I have a
letter of authenticity.

04:50.661 --> 04:52.528
It's graded at 85 out of 100.

04:52.563 --> 04:53.932
This is legitimate.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.868
All right, what do
you need to get for it?

04:55.902 --> 04:57.603
Take a deep breath.

04:57.638 --> 04:59.039
$50,000.

04:59.074 --> 05:00.610
- How much?
- $50,000?

05:00.645 --> 05:02.279
Is it really worth that much?

05:02.313 --> 05:03.580
I think that's a bargain.

05:03.614 --> 05:06.619
You cannot find this.
50 grand.

05:06.653 --> 05:09.156
It's a number that, if I sold it for,

05:09.190 --> 05:10.925
I wouldn't have seller's remorse.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.662
I feel like I have listener's remorse.

05:12.696 --> 05:15.334
- [Laughter]
- That's a lot.

05:15.368 --> 05:16.737
Wow.

05:16.771 --> 05:18.239
I don't have anywhere to go with that.

05:18.273 --> 05:20.240
I mean, I would need to go to a higher-up,

05:20.275 --> 05:21.641
a higher authority.

05:21.676 --> 05:23.844
You don't keep $50k in old Betsy?

05:23.878 --> 05:26.412
[Laughs] You know, if you can't run

05:26.446 --> 05:27.846
with the big dogs, stay on the porch.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.180
I guess I'm on the porch.

05:29.215 --> 05:31.182
Under the porch, piddling yourself.

05:31.217 --> 05:33.587
[Laughter]

05:33.621 --> 05:36.088
No, I'm sorry. I can't do it.

05:36.122 --> 05:37.421
No problem, no problem.

05:37.456 --> 05:38.856
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

05:38.890 --> 05:40.157
All right, guys, take care. Take care.

05:40.191 --> 05:41.725
- Good luck with that.
- Hey, Walt,

05:41.759 --> 05:43.794
did you ever meet
my buddy Butch Patrick?

05:43.828 --> 05:45.629
- Eddie Munster.
- That'd be me, Butch Patrick.

05:45.663 --> 05:46.664
Yeah.

05:54.114 --> 05:55.040
Afternoon.

05:55.040 --> 05:59.981
Hey, Walt, did you ever
meet my buddy Butch Patrick?

06:00.015 --> 06:01.415
Eddie Munster.

06:01.449 --> 06:02.984
That'd be me, Butch Patrick. Yeah.

06:03.019 --> 06:04.586
We're doing a con this weekend up north,

06:04.620 --> 06:06.487
and I just wanted to bring him by.

06:06.522 --> 06:08.223
<i>I know how much a big fan
of the Munsters you are, man.</i>

06:08.257 --> 06:10.360
- Oh, my God.
- [Laughing]

06:10.394 --> 06:13.099
Eddie Munster, butch
Patrick, came into the store?

06:13.134 --> 06:15.511
Yeah, he's actually
friends with Rob Bruce.

06:15.511 --> 06:16.570
Oh. Get out of here.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.980
Have you ever wished that
maybe you could've been friends

06:20.014 --> 06:21.347
with a TV character?

06:21.382 --> 06:23.784
Absolutely. Samantha from Bewitched.

06:23.818 --> 06:24.853
More than friends?

06:24.887 --> 06:27.124
- Oh, yeah.
- [Laughter]

06:27.158 --> 06:28.726
Well, I mean, a best friend, though,

06:28.761 --> 06:30.629
'cause, like, when I was growing up,

06:30.663 --> 06:31.830
mine was Eddie Munster.

06:31.864 --> 06:33.468
Eddie Munster? That was yours?

06:33.503 --> 06:35.137
Yeah. He was a cool kid.

06:35.172 --> 06:36.738
He had the best parents.

06:36.773 --> 06:38.973
He lived in the coolest house on the block.

06:39.008 --> 06:41.144
If I lived in the same
neighborhood with Eddie Munster,

06:41.179 --> 06:42.848
me and him would've been good pals.

06:42.882 --> 06:45.350
- So your TV friend is Rob Bruce's real
- Life friend?

06:45.384 --> 06:48.054
[Laughter]

06:48.088 --> 06:49.555
This is great... I've been
wanting to see this place

06:49.589 --> 06:50.888
for a long time.

06:50.922 --> 06:52.289
It's a privilege and an honor

06:52.323 --> 06:53.757
to, I mean, have you walk in the stash.

06:53.791 --> 06:55.226
I mean, I'm a gigantic fan.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.362
- He's actually a little tongue
- Tied.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.031
- Told you.
- I really am.

06:58.066 --> 06:59.598
I mean, I don't want to
weird you out or anything

06:59.632 --> 07:01.098
or creep you out, but, I mean,

07:01.132 --> 07:02.965
I can't tell you how
many afternoons as a kid

07:02.999 --> 07:04.535
I spent, like, daydreaming,

07:04.570 --> 07:06.238
you know, that, like, me
and you were best friends,

07:06.272 --> 07:08.571
'cause, like, it seemed like
you had the greatest house

07:08.605 --> 07:10.872
and the greatest childhood being a munster.

07:10.906 --> 07:12.576
It was a good thing
to be part of something

07:12.610 --> 07:14.313
that's affected so many
people in a positive way.

07:14.347 --> 07:16.382
I used to think more
about Marilyn than you.

07:16.416 --> 07:17.750
[Laughter]

07:17.784 --> 07:20.886
I mean, not to
disparage another TV show,

07:20.921 --> 07:22.955
but, like, there was the Addams family,

07:22.989 --> 07:25.057
- and there was the Munsters.
- Right.

07:25.091 --> 07:26.560
<i>Addams family couldn't
hold a candle to the Munsters.</i>

07:26.594 --> 07:28.297
I didn't want to hang out with Pugsley,

07:28.331 --> 07:29.931
but I wanted to hang out with you.

07:29.966 --> 07:31.331
I just wanted to be a munster.

07:31.365 --> 07:33.497
I felt there was two camps back then.

07:33.532 --> 07:34.932
Either you were...
I know what you're gonna say.

07:34.966 --> 07:36.669
<i>- A Munsters...
- Or?</i>

07:36.703 --> 07:38.238
<i>Or you were the Addams family guy.</i>

07:38.272 --> 07:40.207
It's true.

07:40.241 --> 07:43.276
<i>Addams family always felt
like your dad's creepy show,</i>

07:43.310 --> 07:46.046
<i>whereas the Munsters felt
like your creepy show,</i>

07:46.080 --> 07:47.881
'cause you're like, never
mind, like, you know,

07:47.916 --> 07:50.083
these people who are
like, "we're a little ooky

07:50.117 --> 07:52.315
and strange." This is..

07:52.350 --> 07:55.719
- His dad is Frankenstein!
- [Laughter]

07:55.754 --> 07:57.418
<i>I felt like the Munsters,
there was a feeling</i>

07:57.453 --> 08:00.755
of true family love in there,

08:00.789 --> 08:03.392
<i>whereas the Addams family
didn't really have a soul.</i>

08:03.426 --> 08:05.762
<i>Made the Brady bunch look
like a bunch of hatemongers.</i>

08:05.796 --> 08:07.766
[Laughter]

08:07.800 --> 08:09.568
You know what?

08:09.603 --> 08:11.302
Would you mind if we brought over...

08:11.337 --> 08:12.403
<I>I have a Munsters magazine</I>

08:12.437 --> 08:14.139
- up at the front.
- No, sure.

08:14.173 --> 08:15.809
<i>Could you go grab that
munster magazine for me?</i>

08:15.844 --> 08:17.274
- Absolutely. It's up front?
- It's up front.

08:17.309 --> 08:19.477
Go on, spot.

08:19.511 --> 08:20.711
What about the Dragula.

08:20.746 --> 08:22.681
Did you ever take a ride in the Dragula?

08:22.715 --> 08:24.350
You got to remember, I
was only 11 and 12 back then.

08:24.385 --> 08:26.553
Now, I drove the munster
coach, you know, as an adult,

08:26.587 --> 08:28.289
but I never drove the Dragula, no.

08:28.323 --> 08:30.927
<i>- Oh.
- Monster world number two, huh?</i>

08:30.961 --> 08:34.032
You know '64, '65, monster magazines...

08:34.066 --> 08:35.533
really hot.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.833
<i>Obviously the Munsters was driving that,</i>

08:37.869 --> 08:40.102
so they get their own
issue... issue number two.

08:40.136 --> 08:41.772
I mean, the show's been very good to me.

08:41.806 --> 08:43.437
The fans are the best. The people come out.

08:43.471 --> 08:45.773
It's a show that kids can
watch today, and they like it.

08:45.807 --> 08:48.373
They think the TV's broken,
'cause it's in black and white.

08:48.407 --> 08:50.338
But once they get past
that, they really enjoy it,

08:50.373 --> 08:52.675
and the grandkids and the
grandparents watch it together.

08:52.709 --> 08:55.081
I mean, yeah... I
mean, I've tried to take

08:55.116 --> 08:59.118
some of that father-son dynamic
that Eddie and Herman had.

08:59.153 --> 09:03.024
I try to instill that message
with my own kids, even today.

09:03.058 --> 09:04.958
I thought you were gonna say these two.

09:04.993 --> 09:06.395
[Laughter]

09:06.429 --> 09:08.599
- And it works too.
- It was good stuff.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.100
I'm really happy to have been part of it.

09:10.135 --> 09:12.803
I mean, what a time
to be a Monster fan...

09:12.837 --> 09:14.439
that mid '60s era.

09:14.473 --> 09:15.908
This is a great book, by the way.

09:15.943 --> 09:17.543
This is funny. This
is the woof woof doll...

09:17.577 --> 09:19.813
this was the most popular
picture over the years,

09:19.847 --> 09:22.717
- I still use today.
- Did they let you keep Wolfie?

09:22.751 --> 09:24.255
I didn't get him till
about six years later.

09:24.289 --> 09:25.957
The prop master took me aside, and said,

09:25.991 --> 09:27.893
"here, take this home with
you and don't show anybody."

09:27.927 --> 09:29.430
And lo and behold, I open it up,

09:29.464 --> 09:30.732
and it was woof woof.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.236
I even wound up getting a suit recently.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.302
My mom found it, believe it or not.

09:35.337 --> 09:37.304
That's what I had on display at
the comic con we just came from.

09:37.339 --> 09:38.840
You have one of the suits with you?

09:38.874 --> 09:41.110
Would you like to see the suit?

09:41.144 --> 09:42.778
- I...
- [Laughter]

09:42.813 --> 09:44.512
See at a minimum, wear at a maximum.

09:44.546 --> 09:45.912
[Laughter]

09:45.946 --> 09:47.581
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

09:47.616 --> 09:50.154
- Oh, he still has it?
- Yeah.

09:50.188 --> 09:52.923
- But he don't wear it now.
- No, it's tiny.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.790
Can you imagine that moment,
though, where he's like,

09:54.825 --> 09:56.756
"I'm gonna play a werewolf?
Cool. Where's the outfit?

09:56.791 --> 09:58.627
- Oh." 
- [Laughter]

09:58.661 --> 10:01.894
Yeah, it's like a little
jacket and, like, short pants.

10:01.929 --> 10:03.961
I get beat up a lot, I guess.

10:03.995 --> 10:07.529
I present thee, Eddie Munster's suit.

10:07.564 --> 10:09.363
- All: Wow!
- One of them.

10:09.397 --> 10:11.866
This is the 12-year-old version.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.467
Seen probably better days,
but it's the real deal.

10:14.501 --> 10:16.134
- Can I touch it?
- Yes, of course, of course.

10:16.169 --> 10:18.539
No problem.
So is this the original

10:18.573 --> 10:20.443
- color and everything?
- Yep.

10:20.478 --> 10:21.911
So, you know, it was black
and white, so you didn't know.

10:21.945 --> 10:23.412
I didn't think it was so brown.

10:23.447 --> 10:25.081
In the color movie,
it was a purple suit.

10:25.115 --> 10:26.615
But during the shooting of the show,

10:26.650 --> 10:28.917
it was this, like, this mushroom color.

10:28.951 --> 10:30.584
But that was probably the
worst part of the show,

10:30.619 --> 10:32.385
'cause I thought it
was, like, a sissy suit.

10:32.420 --> 10:33.819
You know, knee socks and a little bow tie

10:33.854 --> 10:35.153
and a little lord fauntleroy suit.

10:35.187 --> 10:36.653
That was the coolest outfit ever.

10:36.688 --> 10:38.154
I'm not kidding around, man.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.322
So I could show up
to school in Lily's gown

10:40.356 --> 10:43.727
and be less, like, a target
than you would be wearing that.

10:43.761 --> 10:45.495
[Laughter]

10:45.529 --> 10:46.996
Oh, I disagree, man.

10:47.031 --> 10:48.266
People really get a kick out of it.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.069
It's amazing, 50 years later,

10:50.104 --> 10:52.070
you know, grandparents watching
it with their grandkids.

10:52.104 --> 10:54.104
It's inspired a lot of
people like yourself,

10:54.138 --> 10:55.637
and they don't say, "it's
one of my favorite shows."

10:55.672 --> 10:57.274
They'll say, "man, that
was my favorite show.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.810
I mean, that was it."

10:58.845 --> 11:00.012
Hey, butch, it's getting a little late.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.513
We got to get you to the airport.

11:01.547 --> 11:02.814
We got to get you on an airplane.

11:02.848 --> 11:04.082
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

11:04.116 --> 11:05.751
Time's short. On the fly.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.320
It was a pleasure, though.

11:07.354 --> 11:08.789
Thank you so much for coming
down... it was a pleasure.

11:08.823 --> 11:10.491
- No, thank you guys.
- Robert, thank you.

11:10.526 --> 11:12.861
I have to take my suit.
I hope you don't mind.

11:12.896 --> 11:14.664
It's leaving! [Laughing]

11:14.698 --> 11:16.530
Bye-bye, guys. Take care.
I'll see you all later.

11:16.565 --> 11:19.533
- See you later, guys.
- [Exhales deeply]

11:19.568 --> 11:22.371
So, tell me... how does Robert

11:22.406 --> 11:25.405
have a friend of that magnitude
and he doesn't brag about it?

11:25.439 --> 11:28.907
Because I think "friend"
translates into "driver."

11:28.941 --> 11:30.909
[Laughter]

11:30.943 --> 11:34.245
Notice he has to take
him to the airport, so...

11:34.280 --> 11:38.815
<I>Hey, guys, I called in earlier
about preacher issue number one.</I>

11:38.850 --> 11:41.954
- Here you go.
- [Gasps] Thank you so much.

11:41.989 --> 11:45.690
I have here the T-Rex from
the original movie Jurassic Park.

11:45.714 --> 11:47.899
Do you remember the summer
of 1993 when it came out?

11:47.993 --> 11:49.728
- Changed my life forever.
- I wanted to see

11:49.762 --> 11:51.563
if you guys might be interested in that.

11:53.365 --> 11:55.598
Did you ever wonder, "why was
Eddie Munster a werewolf boy?"

11:55.633 --> 11:57.268
I mean, his dad was Frankenstein.

11:57.303 --> 12:00.505
So you got an undead
father and a vampire mother,

12:00.540 --> 12:04.145
and somehow that equals werewolf boy.

12:04.179 --> 12:07.616
Maybe there's some key
party at the Munsters',

12:07.651 --> 12:12.124
and Lily winds up with some
werewolf friend of theirs.

12:12.158 --> 12:14.157
That's what I thought.
That or a recessive gene.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.828
How about the most
obvious answer... adoption?

12:16.863 --> 12:19.133
- You know?
- Oh, excellent point.

12:19.168 --> 12:21.471
How do you have a child
with a man who's dead?

12:21.505 --> 12:23.770
Like, Herman couldn't father
children... they adopted one.

12:23.805 --> 12:26.174
Why wouldn't he be
able to father a child?

12:26.208 --> 12:28.511
Well, Herman is a Frankenstein monster.

12:28.545 --> 12:30.044
- Right.
- So I think

12:30.079 --> 12:32.045
when you're putting the man back together,

12:32.080 --> 12:35.152
the last thing I think you
include is, like, the testicles.

12:35.186 --> 12:36.986
I don't think, like, Dr.
Frankenstein was, like...

12:37.021 --> 12:38.386
see, for a man,

12:38.421 --> 12:39.987
that's the first thing you start with.

12:40.022 --> 12:42.026
[Laughter]

12:52.702 --> 12:55.441
Do you think superheroes
have a threshold for crime,

12:55.475 --> 12:56.811
that they won't intervene?

12:56.846 --> 12:58.348
Like, "eh, someone else will get that"?

12:58.382 --> 13:00.955
I think any crime
where there's a victim,

13:00.989 --> 13:03.959
a superhero is obligated to stop it.

13:03.994 --> 13:05.726
Identity theft.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.862
- Identity theft? Seriously?
- Yeah, right.

13:07.897 --> 13:09.665
Why not? It happened to me.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.002
Some P.O.S. Was charging all
electronics on my credit card.

13:12.037 --> 13:13.972
I wish Superman would shake
him around a little bit.

13:14.006 --> 13:15.874
I'd just feel bad for
him. Where he's like,

13:15.908 --> 13:17.874
"I got saved from Krypton for this?"

13:17.908 --> 13:19.708
[Laughter] He's like, "my dad saved me

13:19.742 --> 13:21.712
as the last, lone
surviving member of Krypton,

13:21.746 --> 13:23.482
and this is what I'm doing now?"

13:23.516 --> 13:24.847
"Superman, Superman,

13:24.882 --> 13:26.349
doomsday's destroying Metropolis!"

13:26.383 --> 13:27.887
"Oh, no, there's some guy...

13:27.922 --> 13:30.491
he got some bogus charges
on his credit card."

13:30.525 --> 13:32.357
He got a free iPod off Walt Flanagan.

13:32.391 --> 13:34.391
[Laughter]

13:41.405 --> 13:43.141
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

13:43.176 --> 13:47.010
<i>I called in earlier about
preacher issue number one.</i>

13:47.045 --> 13:48.644
Yes, I put it behind
the counter for you.

13:48.679 --> 13:49.811
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

13:49.846 --> 13:51.948
[Gasps] Thank you so much.

13:59.223 --> 14:00.757
<i>So why preacher?</i>

14:00.791 --> 14:02.659
You may not be able
to tell by looking at me,

14:02.693 --> 14:05.163
but I grew up in a really conservative,

14:05.197 --> 14:06.600
religious household.

14:06.634 --> 14:08.836
- What was the religion?
- Pentecostal.

14:08.871 --> 14:11.074
- Oh. 
- Oh, like snake-handlers?

14:11.109 --> 14:12.444
I'm sure in the south,

14:12.478 --> 14:13.945
but I didn't see any of that growing up.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.446
So you're related...
like, in the book,

14:15.481 --> 14:17.281
it's a lot of fire and brimstone.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.182
You know, everyone was telling
me one way to believe and think,

14:20.216 --> 14:22.116
<I>and so I got into preacher</I>

14:22.151 --> 14:25.921
because this challenges
the idea of, you know,

14:25.956 --> 14:28.423
a system that you've been forced to learn.

14:28.457 --> 14:31.592
And Jesse ouster is just going
against the grain with that.

14:31.626 --> 14:34.865
<i>Preacher, written by
the great Garth Ennis</i>

14:34.900 --> 14:36.867
and drawn by the wonderful Steve Dillon,

14:36.901 --> 14:38.435
was a landmark book.

14:38.470 --> 14:41.404
The reverend Jesse
ouster, who is struck by,

14:41.439 --> 14:44.240
- what, the voice of God?
- The word of God.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.909
The word of God. That was it.

14:45.944 --> 14:48.113
And he's given somewhat
superpowers, of course,

14:48.147 --> 14:49.715
powers of the lord.

14:49.749 --> 14:52.550
Takes it upon himself to go
out and hold God accountable

14:52.585 --> 14:54.886
for the world that he
made and walked away from.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.454
As a guy raised in a faith...
I was raised catholic,

14:57.489 --> 15:00.422
<i>so reading preacher was like
looking at playboy magazine</i>

15:00.457 --> 15:03.455
when you were a kid, because
it was just so "sacrilicious."

15:03.489 --> 15:05.992
[Laughter]
Yeah.

15:06.026 --> 15:07.826
You don't know how
long I've been waiting

15:07.860 --> 15:09.427
to get my hands back on this.

15:09.462 --> 15:11.763
Two years ago, I had a really bad flood

15:11.798 --> 15:13.332
in my basement apartment.

15:13.366 --> 15:14.833
I lost everything,

15:14.867 --> 15:16.767
<i>including the entire
collection of preacher.</i>

15:16.801 --> 15:19.703
I actually lost all my comics in Sandy.

15:19.738 --> 15:22.139
- Oh, really? Same here.
- Yeah.

15:22.173 --> 15:24.140
So you know exactly how I feel.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.775
I empathize completely with you.

15:25.810 --> 15:28.144
You know, I just had
to start, you know, over.

15:28.179 --> 15:30.680
So it took two years,
because I had to work.

15:30.714 --> 15:33.081
[Laughs] I had to make extra money,

15:33.115 --> 15:34.815
so I can start rebuilding things and move,

15:34.850 --> 15:36.884
and, you know, now I'm up

15:36.919 --> 15:39.053
to trying to rebuild my comic collection.

15:39.087 --> 15:40.453
I felt really bad for her.

15:40.488 --> 15:42.389
- This was her first book...
- Mm-hmm.

15:42.423 --> 15:44.094
Back into comics.

15:44.129 --> 15:46.664
Journey of a million miles
begins with a single copy

15:46.698 --> 15:48.231
<i>of preacher number one.
Right.</i>

15:48.265 --> 15:49.932
I guess two years after the flood,

15:49.966 --> 15:51.667
you're probably in the
mind-set now of like,

15:51.701 --> 15:53.668
"okay, I've taken care of
all the important things.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.738
What were the things that
simply made me happy?"

15:55.772 --> 15:58.277
And that's obviously something
that really did it for her.

15:58.311 --> 15:59.981
She and Mike bonded, for sure,

16:00.016 --> 16:02.182
a little bit more than
I thought they should've.

16:02.216 --> 16:03.952
They had the flood to bond over, man.

16:03.986 --> 16:06.690
A little jealousy going on
here, a little competition.

16:06.723 --> 16:08.289
I wish I got some stuff
ruined in the hurricane.

16:08.324 --> 16:10.621
[Laughter]
I got left out of that club.

16:10.656 --> 16:15.827
- So we're asking $199.95...
- [Sighs]

16:15.861 --> 16:17.961
But for you,

16:17.996 --> 16:21.266
because I can help you with you
first step towards rebuilding

16:21.301 --> 16:23.365
- your comic book collection...
- Right.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.834
How does $165 sound?

16:24.868 --> 16:26.537
- That's perfect.
- Sold.

16:26.571 --> 16:29.539
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

16:32.010 --> 16:33.747
And for you.

16:33.781 --> 16:35.049
- And one last thing.
- Yes?

16:35.083 --> 16:36.317
Can I give you a hug?

16:36.352 --> 16:38.385
- Absolutely!
- Thank you!

16:38.419 --> 16:41.119
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:41.153 --> 16:43.356
The way I see it, he had
to give her $30 to hug him.

16:43.390 --> 16:44.959
Yeah.

16:44.993 --> 16:46.694
- How's it going, guys?
- Oh, hey, how you doing?

16:46.729 --> 16:48.765
- Good. How are you?
- I have here the T-Rex

16:48.799 --> 16:50.902
<i>from the original movie Jurassic Park.</i>

16:50.937 --> 16:53.005
Oh, look at that.

16:58.796 --> 17:00.735
- How's it going, guys?
- Oh, hey, how you doing?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.909
- Good. How are you?
- Oh, look at that.

17:02.943 --> 17:06.577
I have here the t-Rex from
the original movie Jurassic Park

17:06.611 --> 17:09.148
I wanted to see if you guys
might be interested in that.

17:09.183 --> 17:10.284
Oh, I remember that, right?

17:18.762 --> 17:21.229
Do you remember the summer
of '93 when that came out?

17:21.297 --> 17:23.034
Changed my life forever.

17:23.068 --> 17:25.704
Before that, you know, dinosaur
movies were all stop-motion.

17:25.738 --> 17:27.137
It kind of took you out of it.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.606
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

17:28.641 --> 17:31.378
unless you were dabbling
in stop-motion movies,

17:31.413 --> 17:33.446
how did it change your life, then?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.148
Just seeing that on the screen.

17:35.182 --> 17:37.451
[Laughter]

17:37.485 --> 17:39.117
Right, I mean, how did
you walk out of that theater

17:39.152 --> 17:40.818
after seeing it and be
like, "my life's changed.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.884
I'm going to do," what?

17:43.918 --> 17:46.320
See it again. [Laughter]

17:46.354 --> 17:47.788
Did you play with
dinosaurs as a kid...

17:47.823 --> 17:49.288
little plastic dinosaurs? I had 'em.

17:49.323 --> 17:50.722
Absolutely, of course.

17:50.757 --> 17:53.625
Boys and girls...
everyone's imagination

17:53.660 --> 17:55.294
is captured by a dinosaur.

17:55.328 --> 17:56.594
My wife's a teacher.

17:56.629 --> 17:58.328
She says all school year long,

17:58.362 --> 18:00.062
they're just waiting to
learn about dinosaurs.

18:00.097 --> 18:01.932
It's the only thing that
captures their attention

18:01.966 --> 18:03.335
throughout the whole school year.

18:03.369 --> 18:05.002
Nothing can break their concentration

18:05.036 --> 18:06.435
when she's talking about dinosaurs.

18:06.470 --> 18:07.936
So she uses them to teach everything,

18:07.971 --> 18:09.572
where she's like "so then the dinosaurs

18:09.607 --> 18:11.978
signed the declaration of independence."

18:12.012 --> 18:14.479
They're like "aah! Did they eat somebody?"

18:14.514 --> 18:16.749
"Of course." [Laughter]

18:16.784 --> 18:18.153
I'm dying to ask you this question.

18:18.187 --> 18:19.821
Okay.

18:19.855 --> 18:22.657
- If there was a real
- Life Jurassic Park right now...

18:22.691 --> 18:24.996
- Okay.
- Would you go?

18:25.031 --> 18:28.701
Well, just like any zoo I've
ever been to, I guarantee you,

18:28.736 --> 18:31.503
you pay this exorbitant amount
of money to get in there,

18:31.537 --> 18:33.673
you wouldn't see one dinosaur.

18:33.707 --> 18:35.641
You'd be like, "oh, well, where is it?

18:35.676 --> 18:37.710
Oh, I can't find it."
He's sleeping.

18:37.745 --> 18:39.512
Yeah, he's sleeping,
and he's behind that tree,

18:39.547 --> 18:41.148
and you never saw him.

18:41.182 --> 18:43.017
You'd pay your 10 grand
to go into Jurassic Park,

18:43.053 --> 18:44.887
and you'd be all like,

18:44.921 --> 18:46.887
"well, it smelled horrible,
but I didn't see any dinosaurs."

18:46.922 --> 18:48.722
[Laughter]
You're right.

18:48.757 --> 18:52.461
You going?

18:52.495 --> 18:54.462
Not first week. I saw the movies.

18:54.496 --> 18:56.831
I want to wait until it's vetted, tested,

18:56.865 --> 18:58.467
they've been up and
running for about a year,

18:58.501 --> 18:59.734
but at that point, yeah.

18:59.769 --> 19:01.335
I mean, should we, as a species,

19:01.369 --> 19:03.902
be bringing back creatures that, you know,

19:03.937 --> 19:05.538
don't belong in our era?

19:05.573 --> 19:07.641
Yeah, but at the same
time, if they could bring

19:07.675 --> 19:09.175
back a dinosaur, then they could start

19:09.209 --> 19:11.412
bringing back our favorite shows, man.

19:11.446 --> 19:14.481
<i>Like Roseanne, firefly,</i>

19:14.515 --> 19:17.083
all those shows that get
canceled that we like.

19:17.118 --> 19:20.086
All right, so why are you
looking to sell it today?

19:20.121 --> 19:21.820
I have so many items,

19:21.855 --> 19:25.825
and this is an item that I
think is very popular right now.

19:25.859 --> 19:28.094
You know, the movie's gonna
be coming out next year.

19:28.128 --> 19:29.929
<i>Oh, they're making a new Jurassic Park?</i>

19:29.964 --> 19:32.198
<i>They are making another
Jurassic Park movie and...</i>

19:32.233 --> 19:34.102
So what do you think? Does it interest you?

19:34.136 --> 19:36.371
Well, first off, what are
you looking to get for it?

19:36.406 --> 19:38.106
I'd like to get $300 for it.

19:38.141 --> 19:39.408
$300?

19:39.442 --> 19:41.178
Does this piece go for that much?

19:41.212 --> 19:42.379
- Absolutely.
- I don't remember

19:42.413 --> 19:43.747
these being that collectible,

19:43.781 --> 19:45.717
even back when they came out in '93.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.753
What makes it worth $300?

19:47.788 --> 19:49.926
Well, if you're dealing
with kids that were nine,

19:49.960 --> 19:52.497
ten years old that are now 25, 30,

19:52.532 --> 19:55.234
and they're looking to
get their childhood back.

19:55.268 --> 19:56.803
Nostalgia sells.

19:56.838 --> 19:59.005
I remember this. Whoa, $300!

19:59.040 --> 20:02.973
[Laughter]
I mean, not to insult you,

20:03.007 --> 20:06.409
but it's just the fact
that it's not something

20:06.443 --> 20:08.912
we would carry usually in the stash.

20:08.947 --> 20:11.615
If I try to put $300 on this,

20:11.650 --> 20:13.481
it becomes a permanent fixture here.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.848
- Okay.
- Just sitting here

20:14.883 --> 20:16.149
forever at that price.

20:16.183 --> 20:17.518
I can't pull the trigger

20:17.552 --> 20:19.719
on anywhere near what you're looking for.

20:19.753 --> 20:21.485
- All right, well...
- I'm sorry.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.152
Listen, I appreciate your time.

20:23.186 --> 20:26.151
- Have a nice day.
- See you later.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.953
Favorite dinosaur?

20:27.988 --> 20:29.790
I guess, like, T-Rex
from Jurassic Park.

20:29.824 --> 20:31.792
Probably the most
believable-looking dinosaur

20:31.826 --> 20:33.392
I've ever seen.

20:33.426 --> 20:35.463
Yeah, I was gonna say I
thought, you know, Barney.

20:35.497 --> 20:38.433
[Laughter]
The richest dinosaur we know.

20:38.468 --> 20:42.138
No, that's the most punchable dinosaur.

20:42.172 --> 20:44.407
Oh, the all-seeing eye of a
gamotto has blinked,

20:44.441 --> 20:45.908
and the show is over, man.

20:45.943 --> 20:47.277
<i>For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

20:47.311 --> 20:49.081
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.917
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:50.952 --> 20:52.451
Wookiee fur is murder, kids,

20:52.486 --> 20:55.521
- so always use Ewok instead.
- [Laughs]

20:55.555 --> 20:56.722
Good night.
