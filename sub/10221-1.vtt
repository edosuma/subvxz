01:38.531 --> 01:39.964
Don't worry.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.466
You don't trust me?

01:41.534 --> 01:43.968
I got the money.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.471
Let's see the stuff.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.972
Let's see the money.

01:55.548 --> 01:56.480
Money.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.273
This is sugar!

02:22.342 --> 02:23.502
No shit?

02:23.576 --> 02:25.009
Yeah, no shit.

02:26.546 --> 02:27.808
And this...

02:27.881 --> 02:28.939
is gasoIine.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.817
Come on,
torch him, man!

02:40.760 --> 02:42.250
Aah!

02:48.868 --> 02:50.995
Oh! Aah!

02:57.076 --> 02:59.010
Mrs. GauItier,

02:59.078 --> 03:00.511
I'm sorry
this happened

03:00.580 --> 03:01.945
to your famiIy.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.279
We've done
everything we couId.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.784
In cases Iike this,
it is very difficuIt

03:06.853 --> 03:08.821
to make any kind
of prediction,

03:08.888 --> 03:12.255
so for the next coupIe of months,
it's going to be touch and go.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.917
Mrs. GauItier--

03:13.993 --> 03:16.018
The insurance
has expired, I know.

03:17.263 --> 03:22.758
Does he have any other reIatives,
anyone eIse that couId possibIy heIp?

03:22.835 --> 03:23.802
No.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.465
Come on, NicoIe.
Let's go home.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.137
Lyon.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.035
Lyon.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.081
Lyon.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.479
Lyon!

03:40.320 --> 03:43.812
Lyon!

04:21.861 --> 04:25.388
Ha ha ha.
Aye, Lyon.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.093
Wonder what's in
the goody sack for you today?

04:28.167 --> 04:30.863
Heh heh.
Let's have a Iook.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.531
There we go.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.473
''Legionnaire
Lyon GauItier.''

04:40.546 --> 04:41.979
Ooh, yes.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.781
- It's very nice.
- No interest, eh?

04:49.055 --> 04:51.114
OK. Back she goes.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.122
Aah!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.225
Aah!

04:58.798 --> 05:00.288
Yeah, GauItier.
That's me.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.337
This one's been out
in the sun too Iong.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.614
She tried to caII me
two weeks ago.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.115
Nobody toId me.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.076
Why?

05:22.689 --> 05:25.351
This is the Foreign
Legion, GauItier,

05:25.425 --> 05:26.858
not CIub Med.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.860
We're taIking about my brother.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.589
He couId be dead by now.

05:30.663 --> 05:35.532
And we couId be at war
with the bIoody wogs tomorrow.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.093
I need your ass here.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.606
Your brother
is not my probIem.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.478
Or yours anymore.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.245
You gave up your famiIy
when you joined the Legion.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.487
I never gave up my famiIy.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.491
Never.

06:01.761 --> 06:05.424
Legionnaire, I don't have time
for this shiesse.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.560
I need to see my brother.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.267
You need what
I teII you you need.

06:16.409 --> 06:20.675
And right now I think
you need two weeks hard Iabor.

06:25.017 --> 06:30.455
You onIy have six months Ieft
in the Legion, GauItier.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.616
Don't make it six years.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.992
You're a reaI asshoIe.

06:42.034 --> 06:43.968
Is there a probIem, sir?

06:44.036 --> 06:46.971
No, no, no, no.
No probIem.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.974
Desert fever.
This is your reaI probIem.

06:50.042 --> 06:53.978
Too many weeks
in the hot sun.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.982
ShaII we try
sweatbox, sir?

06:59.552 --> 07:01.918
Yes,
this might heIp.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.582
Just untiI his
fever breaks.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.074
Cover your head,
Iegionnaire.

07:31.717 --> 07:32.649
Move!

07:34.020 --> 07:34.952
Your beIt.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.922
Come on.

07:41.994 --> 07:42.926
Ugh!

07:43.996 --> 07:45.623
Move!

07:45.698 --> 07:47.632
Your hoteI room
is ready.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.792
OK.

07:49.869 --> 07:50.801
Hyah!

07:57.743 --> 07:58.675
Aah!

08:09.922 --> 08:11.412
Ugh!

08:14.827 --> 08:15.759
Aah!

08:28.541 --> 08:29.803
Aah!

08:46.425 --> 08:47.357
Hyah!

08:53.299 --> 08:54.231
Hyah!

09:09.815 --> 09:11.544
Get me a fucking jeep!

09:38.344 --> 09:40.209
There's no sign
of him, sir.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.581
He'II never make it.

09:45.017 --> 09:48.453
If the wogs don't kiII him,
then the desert wiII.

09:49.689 --> 09:52.852
Just in case, head down to the docks
first thing in the morning.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.125
The ocean is his onIy way
out of the country.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.171
Moustafa, go this way.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.988
Hey!

11:01.060 --> 11:02.687
Get your ass
back down beIow!

11:02.762 --> 11:04.957
Get down to those
boiIer rooms now!

11:05.031 --> 11:06.089
OK.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.996
This ain't no pIeasure cruise.
Move your ass!

11:27.253 --> 11:30.814
The Ietter was
from his sister-in-Iaw.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.654
We are fortunate our inteIIigence
section makes a habit

11:33.726 --> 11:36.160
of recording
return addresses.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.568
We'II contact the Americans

11:43.636 --> 11:46.799
and ask them to keep her
under surveiIIance.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.330
Inspector,
this man is a deserter,

11:50.409 --> 11:53.742
a traitor to France,
and a goddamn terrorist.

11:53.813 --> 11:58.512
Adjutant, aII I can do
is transmit the warrant.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.519
If the Los AngeIes cops
aren't too busy

12:01.587 --> 12:03.953
busting dope deaIers,
gang rapists,

12:04.023 --> 12:05.456
and seriaI kiIIers,

12:05.524 --> 12:09.255
maybe they'II have time
to bring the asshoIe in.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.762
And if they don't,
tough shit.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.968
If they do not,
maybe I can heIp.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.944
You stay off
the top deck.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.379
First Mate's orders.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.051
You were toId not to come up.
Am I right?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.687
Yeah.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.887
And you toId me this ship
was going to Los AngeIes.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.896
What difference
does it make?

13:51.964 --> 13:53.898
You ain't got
no green card.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.399
You ain't got no visa.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.493
You ain't getting off
anywhere, Frenchy,

13:57.570 --> 14:01.131
so get your ass beIow
before somebody reports you,

14:01.207 --> 14:04.370
a deserter,
stowed away on their ship.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.933
You keep stoking my boiIers,

14:06.011 --> 14:08.502
or you'II be breaking rocks
in the hot sun.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.015
Now what's it going to be?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.815
It's going to be simpIe.

14:14.887 --> 14:15.854
Ugh!

14:17.022 --> 14:19.456
Hey, maybe we make a deaI.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.459
You've been
so generous to me.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.459
Huh?

15:17.515 --> 15:19.039
America.

15:26.857 --> 15:28.347
Los AngeIes information.

15:28.426 --> 15:31.554
PIease deposit $2.40.

15:31.629 --> 15:33.563
No, it's my
sister-in-Iaw.

15:33.631 --> 15:35.565
She's waiting for me.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.066
HeIene GauItier.

15:37.134 --> 15:39.864
I don't care if she's
the mayor's sister-in-Iaw.

15:39.937 --> 15:42.462
If I don't hear coins,
this conversation's over.

15:42.540 --> 15:43.973
You got it?

16:13.337 --> 16:16.966
Hey, come on,
get him!

16:25.016 --> 16:26.677
Who you puIIing for,
motherfucker?

16:28.519 --> 16:29.451
KiII that fucker!

16:29.520 --> 16:31.249
Come on, goddamn it!

16:45.569 --> 16:46.968
You want another fight?

16:47.038 --> 16:49.973
You sure you don't
want another fight?

16:50.041 --> 16:51.474
You can win.

16:56.247 --> 16:59.683
Get your money.
I ain't got aII goddamn day.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.989
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

17:04.989 --> 17:06.718
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

17:09.627 --> 17:12.060
Who's going to fight
the next goddamn fight?

17:12.128 --> 17:15.496
Do we even have
a next fight?

17:15.566 --> 17:17.500
Do we have a next fight?

17:17.568 --> 17:18.500
- Yay!
- Yay!

17:18.569 --> 17:20.502
AII right, aII right.

17:20.570 --> 17:22.505

AII right.

17:22.573 --> 17:24.632

- Lyon.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.369
- What?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.502
Lyon.

17:28.579 --> 17:30.444
- Lyon?
- Lyon?

17:30.514 --> 17:31.845
What the fuck is Lyon?

17:35.419 --> 17:37.444
Lion! The Lion!

17:37.521 --> 17:39.455
AII right, aII right.

17:39.523 --> 17:41.957
Who wants

17:42.026 --> 17:44.893
Who wants
to take on the Lion?

17:44.962 --> 17:47.453
Somebody's got
to take on the damn Lion.

17:47.531 --> 17:50.432
Hey, there's my man now.

17:50.501 --> 17:52.526

18:01.979 --> 18:04.914

18:11.889 --> 18:14.858
Ain't nobody going to bet

18:14.925 --> 18:17.018
Bets over, bets over.

18:17.094 --> 18:19.790
Bets over, everybody.
Bets over.

18:24.001 --> 18:29.371
Hey, my man. Look here.
You sure you want to do this, my man?

18:29.440 --> 18:31.874
I'm the onIy one

18:31.942 --> 18:33.375
Don't Iet me down.

18:33.444 --> 18:35.639
This is ours

18:36.747 --> 18:38.942
It's going right here.

18:39.016 --> 18:43.453
Trust me, man.
Can you beat him?

18:43.521 --> 18:45.455
Kick his Iion ass.

18:45.523 --> 18:47.650
AII right, aII right.

18:47.725 --> 18:48.657
Get it on.

19:00.137 --> 19:01.069
Hyah!

That's good, man, good.

19:14.685 --> 19:18.917
I don't beIieve this.
I got me a man here.

19:18.989 --> 19:20.684
You see this?

19:45.516 --> 19:47.040
That's it, my man.

19:58.729 --> 19:59.661
Damn, boy!

Hey! You see that shit?

Put it right there.
You bad, boy.

20:07.538 --> 20:10.974
What the fuck you doing, man?
Get out of my pocket.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.474
AII right, fuck it.

20:12.543 --> 20:15.979
Take it. It's your money

20:17.047 --> 20:18.571
- Wait, Iet me count--

20:18.649 --> 20:20.981
Let me count this shit.

20:21.051 --> 20:23.986
Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't give me enough.

20:24.054 --> 20:28.252
You're a good fighter,
but you can't count worth shit.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.494
The number you have diaIed

20:31.562 --> 20:32.995
is no Ionger in service

20:33.063 --> 20:34.997
and there is
no new number.

20:35.065 --> 20:36.999
If you feeI you have reached
this recording in error,

20:37.067 --> 20:39.001
hang up and diaI again.

20:48.078 --> 20:49.511
Nobody home?

20:51.081 --> 20:52.013
No.

20:53.284 --> 20:56.014
Goddamn, man, don't be
Iookin' at the damn sandwich.

20:56.086 --> 20:57.678
Eat it.
It won't hurt you.

20:57.755 --> 21:00.189
You're the Lion,
king of the jungIe.

21:02.459 --> 21:05.394
- You want to get to L.A., huh?
- Yeah.

21:14.838 --> 21:18.831
Hey, thank you very much, man.

Thank you

21:21.045 --> 21:22.444
Yeah, sure.

21:22.513 --> 21:24.037
That is where

21:24.114 --> 21:26.048
Yeah.
Can you take me there?

21:26.116 --> 21:27.048
Damn straight, baby.

21:27.117 --> 21:28.049

21:28.118 --> 21:30.552
That depends

21:30.621 --> 21:33.818
We have to see some peopIe.
You understand?

21:39.063 --> 21:40.997
Hey, now.

21:46.070 --> 21:48.504

21:48.572 --> 21:50.938
You'II have to be
more specific.

21:51.008 --> 21:55.809
Cut the shit. TeII her Joshua's here
with someone I think she'd Iike to meet.

22:00.084 --> 22:02.620
WeII, if it
ain't oId Joshua.

22:02.753 --> 22:03.947
My main man.

22:04.021 --> 22:05.955
Uh-huh, yeah.

22:06.023 --> 22:07.456
How did you find us?

22:07.524 --> 22:09.958
Word gets out.

22:10.027 --> 22:11.961
I want you to

22:12.029 --> 22:13.963
You chose a bad time.

22:14.031 --> 22:15.464

22:15.532 --> 22:16.464
No, no.

22:16.533 --> 22:17.625
Now.

22:20.037 --> 22:23.564
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

22:23.641 --> 22:27.475
My man just kicked five asses.
You want to be number six?

You made a totaI...

30:48.078 --> 30:51.275

30:53.083 --> 30:54.516

30:54.584 --> 30:56.848
Where eIse wiII you

30:56.920 --> 30:59.013
That's my business,

30:59.089 --> 31:00.522
Stop the car.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.558
What if we arrange

31:04.795 --> 31:07.355
Arrange it

31:07.431 --> 31:08.864
and stop the car.

31:18.909 --> 31:22.777
