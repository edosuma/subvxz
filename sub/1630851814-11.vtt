WEBVTT

00:50.759 --> 00:53.094
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.178 --> 00:55.638
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:59.642 --> 01:01.394
Stick to what you do best.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.024
I heard you used to be a maid.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.112
How crude.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.121
<i>Yes, Seon-a.</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:23.124
Kang Yo-han leaked info about me
to Cha Gyeong-hui.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.959
<i>-What?</i>
-Look into it.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.294
<i>No way, not Kang Yo-han…</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:28.671
Just shut up and look into it!

01:31.633 --> 01:34.344
Stand in my way, and you'll pay the price.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.387
It looks like
you worked hard all this time.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.640
Would you be okay with that?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.747
I'm going to kill him.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.751
Kang Yo-han…

02:07.877 --> 02:10.380
I'm going to rip him to pieces!

02:23.476 --> 02:25.895
But isn't that too risky?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.482
-You said she's unpredictable.
-I told you.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.235
There's no way around it
if those who dominate the world

02:32.318 --> 02:33.403
have formed one team.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.697
But we got hold of
Do Young-choon, didn't we?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.949
We could use him to
catch Cha Gyeong-hui first--

02:38.032 --> 02:41.161
And take it to the prosecution?
Or the media?

02:44.330 --> 02:47.667
She holds evidence of corruption
by owners of major media companies.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.212
It's impossible to bring her down
from the outside.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.673
So you'll leave them with no choice
but to point their swords at each other?

02:55.466 --> 02:57.886
What if they end up pointing
that sword at you?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.805
How do you expect to turn the game
around without wagering anything?

03:00.889 --> 03:03.474
Fortunately,

03:04.434 --> 03:07.478
everyone has a weak point
where they'll feel pain.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.481
Whoever he or she may be, that is.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.910
Did you have dinner?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.120
What about Young-min?

03:24.829 --> 03:26.331
The same as ever.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.127
His wounds have almost healed, but still…

03:33.546 --> 03:34.839
Mom.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.008
Let's move to the States.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.427
I don't think I can live here anymore.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.431
I'm just so scared, Mom.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.433
Please come with me.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.603
Get up.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.481
-But Mom--
-I said, get up.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.523
Get up.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.442
Can't you hear me?

03:55.693 --> 03:57.153
Get up!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.242
You little weakling!

04:02.325 --> 04:04.994
-Honey…
-Is that all you can come up with?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.206
After suffering such humiliation, how…

04:08.289 --> 04:11.626
How could you, you imbecile?

04:25.348 --> 04:28.184
How much does Cha Gyeong-hui know?

04:30.603 --> 04:33.189
I looked into it,
but there are just no links.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.359
They're worse than enemies,

04:36.442 --> 04:39.320
so do you think Cha Gyeong-hui
would take Kang Yo-han's hand?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.738
There's only Kang Yo-han

04:41.406 --> 04:43.825
who can slip a knife
into Cha Gyeong-hui's hands

04:43.908 --> 04:45.660
to stab me in the back.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.166
He must be after something.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.884
MINISTER CHA GYEONG-HUI

05:10.101 --> 05:11.728
Hello, Minister.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.282
You'd done a great job hiding it.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.908
I see you spent some money.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.454
A mother who used to beat her daughter

05:29.537 --> 05:33.041
whenever she was drunk happen
to roll down the stairs to her death.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.419
The security lights were off
and the only witness was her daughter.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.964
But what a superb actress
she must have been

05:40.048 --> 05:42.508
because the police concluded
the death as a simple fall

05:42.592 --> 05:45.386
without doubting the child's tears.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.474
That should be enough material,
shouldn't it?

05:50.224 --> 05:53.561
The only evidence of that case
was her daughter's testimony.

05:53.644 --> 05:57.315
So what if there was a doctor's opinion
that overturns all these claims?

05:57.398 --> 06:00.401
That the victim
wasn't inebriated at the time,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.154
and the fall can't be explained

06:03.237 --> 06:05.490
unless someone had pushed her from behind.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.745
There was no such opinion.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.707
Do you still not get it?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.710
You see,

06:18.377 --> 06:20.296
truth is something I craft.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.009
All I need are the materials
to stimulate the imagination.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.928
As I expected from an expert.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.389
I forgot manipulation of evidence

06:30.473 --> 06:32.350
and coercive investigations
are your specialty.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.519
Thanks for the compliments.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.062
What is it that you want?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.355
Kang Yo-han.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.191
Get him and restore my son's reputation.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.777
Then I'll let you go.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.905
But that case was tried and closed,
so how--

06:45.988 --> 06:48.366
That's why I need someone like you.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.953
Someone who was born
and bred in filthy muddy waters,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.247
and who will do anything to survive.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.878
You have one week.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.923
Bring me what I want.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.981
Good evening, Young Master.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.649
I take it that you've been well?

07:32.201 --> 07:34.162
Will it be as usual?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.455
Yes.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.499
All right.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.229
Hello, Young Master.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.695
How did you get in here?

08:52.949 --> 08:54.242
What about the owner?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.123
Don't tell me…

09:01.207 --> 09:02.542
Calm down.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.710
He's just taking a nap.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.798
What is this?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.133
Just…

09:11.217 --> 09:13.344
I've always wanted to try this.

09:14.011 --> 09:18.224
Grooming you to perfection.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.232
If that's what you wish.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.823
By the way,

09:35.283 --> 09:36.784
why did you do that?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.036
What do you mean?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.789
Why did you spill that about me
to Cha Gyeong-hui?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.585
I'm in an awkward position now.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.087
Because I need you.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.423
Do you really mean that?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
I need to get Cha Gyeong-hui,

09:53.884 --> 09:56.053
and I want you to do the same.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.557
So that's why you cornered me, is it?

10:04.562 --> 10:08.482
You're so bad, Young Master.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.985
And so blatant too.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.908
Isn't that why you like me?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.077
Because I'm like you?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.916
What's been done can't be undone.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.545
As long as Cha Gyeong-hui is around,

10:30.838 --> 10:32.923
you'll never be free.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.515
So make your choice.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.648
What if I were to choose this?

10:50.232 --> 10:51.734
I guess I can't help it then.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.863
Do as you wish.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.382
Do you want to come to my place?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.055
You haven't come over for a long while.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.309
I think it'll be fun
and remind us of the old days.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.005
What's on your mind?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.764
Everything here is the same as ever.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.980
But you've changed.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.276
Really?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.194
How?

14:23.237 --> 14:24.321
Chairwoman?

14:28.534 --> 14:29.577
Welcome.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.288
Judge Kang let me know to expect you.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.290
Is that right?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.750
How about you join us at the dining table?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.085
It's dinnertime and all.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.610
Did you really prepare all this,
Judge Kim?

15:02.693 --> 15:05.654
I'm boarding here thanks to you.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.365
But your wounds should have
healed by now. No?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.583
I didn't know you had
so many talents, Judge Kim.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.711
I should say the same about you.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.756
Who knew you had so many talents?

15:29.470 --> 15:30.679
So who is she again?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.682
The chairwoman of
our department's support committee.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.603
But you've never brought home
a woman before.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.938
Are you dating her?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.648
-Elijah.
-What an honor.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.067
So I'm your first female guest, am I?

15:43.734 --> 15:45.069
You two are dating, right?

15:45.986 --> 15:47.571
Shall we eat?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
-So are you?
-I said no.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.915
She supports Judge Kang.
We look forward to more of your support.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.792
Well…

15:59.875 --> 16:03.796
I'm not quite sure
if I'm competent enough to.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.757
I heard you're someone
Judge Kang absolutely needs.

16:08.676 --> 16:12.179
That makes me feel proud.
Did Judge Kang really say that?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.933
Why did you have to bring that up?

16:16.016 --> 16:18.268
Let's just eat. And that includes you.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.604
Elijah, try this first.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.619
It's as if Judge Kim is
part of this family.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.122
You fit right in.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.332
Do I?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.129
Now you won't be lonely.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.507
I'm envious.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.224
Were you two acquainted in the past?

16:57.307 --> 17:02.271
We've been secretly supporting
and rooting for each other,

17:03.564 --> 17:04.898
Ms. Elijah.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.110
What? You even know my name?

17:08.819 --> 17:09.820
How about a toast?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.989
Since we have
a distinguished guest among us.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.332
-Not you.
-Then what about me?

17:22.416 --> 17:23.667
You have your juice.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.712
Thank you.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.338
-Here.
-One moment.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.965
She should be here by now.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.513
It's rare for you to ask me
to come in the evening.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.182
Oh, you have a guest.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.894
Here's to the return of

17:42.561 --> 17:46.190
Chairwoman Jung Seon-a.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.694
Seon-a? Seon-a, that's…

18:00.454 --> 18:01.955
<i>Were you playing with me?</i>

18:03.207 --> 18:05.709
You didn't like that?
I'm sorry to hear it.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.295
And yes, I'm playing with you.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.589
Because you're fun.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.843
You're smart, ruthless,

18:16.303 --> 18:18.222
and broken like I am.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.682
And that's a rare thing.

18:24.686 --> 18:28.774
That's why I thought it might be fun
playing a game with you.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.651
You suggested it first.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.614
You said let's go all the way
to the top of the world.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.826
Together with you.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.862
<i>Now smile.</i>

19:15.988 --> 19:19.158
You blend into this house quite well.

19:32.754 --> 19:35.799
<i>Do you think Jung Seon-a
will really take your hand?</i>

19:36.300 --> 19:38.594
She may side
with Cha Gyeong-hui in the end.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.053
She's that unpredictable.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.558
No way, it's clearly a trap!

19:45.726 --> 19:47.102
Right?

19:47.186 --> 19:51.231
Just what does that Kang Yo-han bastard
think of you to play this game?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.567
It's just unbelievable.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.693
Right.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.363
I know he's just playing
a game with me, and…

20:00.073 --> 20:03.535
he wasn't even trying to hide it, either.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.037
So?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.497
Isn't it strange?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.043
Why do I still want to fall for it?

20:11.835 --> 20:15.422
Even just for a moment?

20:16.882 --> 20:18.508
Seon-a!

20:20.969 --> 20:22.971
I shouldn't, right?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.556
No, right?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.111
Hello, this is Judge Oh Jin-joo.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.488
<i>Oh yes, I know.</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:44.952
I'm President Park Du-man from HMBN.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.663
Hello.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.082
<i>Sorry to call you out of the blue,
but I'd like to meet you sometime.</i>

20:50.165 --> 20:53.085
<i>As a member of the
Social Responsibility Foundation.</i>

20:53.168 --> 20:56.046
Do you mean
the Department of Live Court Show?

20:56.129 --> 21:00.801
Oh no, we'd like to meet with
just you, Judge Oh.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.181
Yes, all right.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.064
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:19.069
Oh, it's nothing.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.222
There she is.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.356
Have a seat.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.817
Over there.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.500
It's nice to meet you.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.960
I'm Oh Jin-joo.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.589
We enjoyed your PR video.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.007
You were born for it!

22:22.090 --> 22:24.718
-You did a great job.
-Thank you.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.220
How about you help
our Foundation's work too?

22:28.096 --> 22:30.766
-By your work, you mean--
-It's all state affairs.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.352
But we need a face
whom the public can trust.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.564
And while you are distinguished,

22:37.647 --> 22:41.193
there were a few things
that weighed on our mind.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.154
I'm not quite sure what you…

22:46.656 --> 22:48.200
When you were a judge at a regional court,

22:48.283 --> 22:51.244
you'd placed a corporate president
under court custody.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.955
All he did was take some money
from his own company.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.832
Isn't that a stay of execution at most?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.043
I wonder why you were so harsh with him.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.754
Are you anti-corporate, perhaps?

23:04.966 --> 23:06.259
Is this…

23:07.302 --> 23:08.386
an interview?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.680
It's clear you're not just after a model.

23:10.764 --> 23:14.976
It's for the presiding judge of
the <i>Live Court Show</i>, is it?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.939
You're quick to understand too.
As expected.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.733
We'd like you to make you a national star,

23:22.317 --> 23:25.403
so we need to see
what risks you hold, shouldn't we?

23:31.034 --> 23:33.662
Has Judge Kang Yo-han
been in this seat too?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.919
What are you talking about?

23:41.962 --> 23:44.256
Even the Chief Justice was in that seat.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.964
Isn't this a better distance
for a conversation?

24:26.756 --> 24:29.301
So what is it that
you want to know about me?

24:38.393 --> 24:40.729
-My true skills--
-It's going to topple!

24:40.812 --> 24:43.607
-It's going to topple!
-Elijah, you just shut up with this.

24:46.943 --> 24:50.197
Topple, topple, topple…

24:57.787 --> 24:59.206
Your turn, Elijah.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
Oh no!

25:03.501 --> 25:05.170
That's going to topple.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.671
You're almost there.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.465
It's going to…

25:18.225 --> 25:20.894
Why don't you join us too, Judge Kang?

25:20.977 --> 25:24.272
-Judge Kang?
-Forget it. Yo-han never joins us.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.535
Judge Kang.
Didn't you have something to say?

25:39.120 --> 25:40.330
What?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.667
Oh, I was just passing by.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.511
<i>There was something ghastly
about Kang Yo-han since then.</i>

25:55.303 --> 25:56.805
Really?

25:56.888 --> 25:59.307
I was playing with my friends one time,

25:59.391 --> 26:02.394
and he'd been watching us in secret,
even mimicking us.

26:02.477 --> 26:05.313
One of you, win! Whoever, we don't care!

26:05.397 --> 26:08.191
-Whoever, we don't care!
-Paper, scissors, rock!

26:08.275 --> 26:09.651
Paper, scissors, rock!

26:14.906 --> 26:18.743
Hey, is paper all you know, you idiot?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.704
-Why do you always lose?
-Oh come on!

26:20.787 --> 26:21.955
I'm sorry.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.458
Get it right next time.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.047
<i>It sent a chill down my spine.</i>

26:32.799 --> 26:34.217
But Father.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.387
Yes?

26:38.638 --> 26:41.391
Perhaps all he wanted was
to join his peers in their game.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.192
<i>What do you mean?</i>

26:51.276 --> 26:52.694
<i>Perhaps that child was…</i>

26:54.946 --> 26:56.823
just very lonely.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.336
-Judge Kang.
-Yes?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.006
What is it?

27:14.174 --> 27:16.343
You interrupted my reading just for this?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.054
I have assignments to do too.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.265
-Then go do your assignment.
-Come on, guys.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.642
Spend some time together as a family.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.686
I have some dishes to do…

27:27.937 --> 27:29.606
Ma'am, join us.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.692
It's not a good idea
to have those two face each other.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.863
-Why?
-I can barely find time to read.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.910
Have you ever sat down with
Elijah for more than five minutes

27:41.993 --> 27:43.161
without picking a fight?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.630
Let's do it. Move.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.341
Go on.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.762
-Go on.
-Just shut up.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.472
Go. Hurry up.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.600
-So I just do it, do I?
-Can't you see?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.519
What a retard.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.355
Hurry up!

28:10.438 --> 28:13.066
-Anything's okay?
-Just do it!

28:38.007 --> 28:39.968
Then I'll go with this.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.934
Elijah, that's…

28:50.061 --> 28:53.773
It's shaking. Great, it's shaking…

28:55.483 --> 28:58.069
This is why you need to know
structural mechanics.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.366
They've been at it for two hours now.
Will this be okay?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.910
I told you to reconsider it, didn't I?

29:08.663 --> 29:10.248
Thirty-one.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.584
I'll go for this one.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.714
Yo-han.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.054
Your hand.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.896
Let's do that again. Pile it up.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.273
Hurry up, hurry!

29:55.960 --> 29:58.338
Is something good going on these days?

29:58.922 --> 30:01.007
You seem different.

30:01.841 --> 30:05.595
Something good?
Sure. I'm with you, aren't I?

30:06.930 --> 30:09.265
You're scaring me. You're joking, right?

30:10.058 --> 30:11.518
I'm not.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.771
Just what is this?

30:14.854 --> 30:18.191
Last time you visited me with your bike,
asked me to go for a walk

30:18.274 --> 30:20.944
and asked me to go for
ice cream together too.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.321
Are you terminally ill?
Is it something serious?

30:24.572 --> 30:25.657
It's not terminal.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.118
-So let's just eat.
-Yes, sir.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.876
<i>Once I'm done with this, then…</i>

30:36.960 --> 30:37.961
It's good.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.176
-Apparently, this place is quite popular.
-Really?

30:50.014 --> 30:52.392
So did you bring the answer I want?

30:53.309 --> 30:56.104
-The start.
-The start?

30:56.187 --> 31:00.066
There were over 20 who testified
as a victim for your son's case.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.360
And it's hard to overturn them all

31:02.443 --> 31:04.279
because that'll also bring
unwanted attention.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.405
So?

31:05.488 --> 31:09.450
But what if this was a case
that got off on the wrong start?

31:09.534 --> 31:12.662
The rest won't look so good, either.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.706
I mean, it's just not pretty, is it?

31:14.789 --> 31:19.711
Then what if we found
one or two more suspicions,

31:20.378 --> 31:21.421
on top of it?

31:22.171 --> 31:25.008
"What was the true intent
of the Presiding Judge,

31:25.091 --> 31:27.468
rushing the trial to
sentence public flogging?"

31:27.552 --> 31:29.637
Not a bad headline.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.598
So what is this "wrong start?"

31:45.361 --> 31:47.530
I'm sure you remember

31:47.614 --> 31:51.743
the first start
who turned the table around.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.746
<i>That man is a total psycho.</i>

31:54.829 --> 31:58.249
<i>He suddenly got out of his car and
started yelling about the traffic line.</i>

31:58.333 --> 32:01.961
<i>When I rushed over in shock,
he slapped me asking who the hell I was.</i>

32:02.503 --> 32:04.839
<i>Honestly, I was so frustrated and angry.</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:05.798
Hey!

32:05.882 --> 32:07.675
That crazy…

32:10.136 --> 32:13.681
You were that girl who was having a ball.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.351
So what can she do for us?

32:16.434 --> 32:19.854
I'll do anything. Just please let Mom go.

32:19.938 --> 32:24.025
She'll testify that Kang Yo-han
forced her to commit perjury.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.568
Is this true?

32:25.652 --> 32:27.070
Is that so important?

32:28.404 --> 32:29.781
What's important is that

32:29.864 --> 32:33.409
we can always make it the truth.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.205
Is my mom really okay?

32:38.122 --> 32:40.083
She has angina, you know.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.920
I let you hear her voice
just now, remember?

32:47.799 --> 32:52.053
Not a bad story.
"Kang Yo-han bought a witness…"

32:52.762 --> 32:55.932
There's that case with Jang Ki-hyeon
which he wriggled free from too.

32:57.266 --> 33:01.354
And if the same thing happens again,
people will have second thoughts.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.526
But do you think Kang Yo-han
would just sit back and watch?

33:06.609 --> 33:09.153
We'll have to surprise him without
giving him a chance to counterattack

33:09.237 --> 33:10.655
in front of the entire nation.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.993
Don't the cameras love you, Minister Cha?

33:22.375 --> 33:27.046
We received a tip-off that seriously
doubts whether the <i>Live Court Show</i>

33:27.130 --> 33:28.673
is being run fairly.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.591
-What were the contents?
-Please tell us.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.095
If I were to disclose it here,
I'd risk being misunderstood that

33:34.178 --> 33:36.431
I'm doing this
for the sake of my child's affairs.

33:37.306 --> 33:38.975
Therefore, I suggest Judge Kang

33:39.058 --> 33:41.728
an open hearing.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.689
I will reveal all before our citizens,

33:45.440 --> 33:48.109
<i>so explain yourself if you can.</i>

33:48.192 --> 33:50.611
<i>In the courthouse of the</i> Live Court Show.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.488
What suspicions
will he be required to explain?

33:52.572 --> 33:54.657
Does it truly have nothing
to do with Mr. Lee Young-min?

34:13.384 --> 34:14.802
Judge Kang,

34:17.722 --> 34:20.641
you're well-known
as the heir of a great fortune.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.518
Is this correct?

34:22.602 --> 34:24.479
Is that what you were so curious about?

34:27.690 --> 34:29.192
Yes, you're right.

34:30.151 --> 34:34.030
Is that why you think you can buy
anything in this world with money?

34:34.113 --> 34:35.990
Could you be more specific
with your questions?

34:36.074 --> 34:38.076
I want to hear the truth, Judge Kang.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.580
You offered monetary rewards
to the witness of the JU Chemical case,

34:42.663 --> 34:44.540
the first trial
of the <i>Live Court Show</i>, correct?

34:44.624 --> 34:46.626
I believe I've already
explained it adequately.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.712
But what if you'd also paid
the witness of the next case?

34:50.546 --> 34:52.673
Isn't that a bit odd?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.717
And especially if you'd requested
a false testimony too.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.469
Well, this is interesting.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.806
What are the grounds for your statement?

35:04.769 --> 35:06.354
Do you remember this person?

35:25.248 --> 35:28.584
I believe you have a lot
that you want to say.

35:28.668 --> 35:32.046
So please pluck up the courage to tell us
in front of all of our citizens.

35:33.297 --> 35:38.010
My name is Han So-yoon.
I had testified that I had been assaulted

35:38.094 --> 35:39.679
by Mr. Lee Young-min.

35:42.056 --> 35:43.349
I…

35:45.852 --> 35:47.854
I had been forced to
give a false testimony.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.359
<i>I had been forced to give
a false testimony.</i>

35:55.444 --> 35:56.445
What?

35:58.072 --> 36:01.200
That's it!
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

36:01.701 --> 36:03.786
I told you Mom will take care of it.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.372
Don't you worry. It'll all work out.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.250
You see,

36:09.917 --> 36:11.836
truth is something I craft.

36:11.919 --> 36:15.423
All I need are the materials
to stimulate the imagination.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.223
OPEN HEARING
JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

36:34.066 --> 36:37.028
I was blackmailed by Minister Cha,
right there.

36:39.405 --> 36:43.242
She said if I don't come out here
and say that I was bribed by Judge Kang,

36:43.326 --> 36:45.828
she would put me in prison

36:45.912 --> 36:48.581
for smuggling drugs, which I never did.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.375
She said it's a piece of cake
making me a criminal.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.544
What are you talking about?
How dare you lie!

36:53.628 --> 36:55.087
But that's what you said!

36:55.671 --> 36:56.839
Is this true?

36:56.923 --> 37:01.260
Yes, she told me so herself in her office
at the Ministry of Justice last week.

37:01.344 --> 37:05.306
If you check their visitor log,
you'll find my name on there.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.309
<i>The first start…</i>

37:09.101 --> 37:11.187
who turned the table around.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.563
Don't you worry.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.148
I'll protect you.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.567
Here, wipe your tears with this.

37:17.693 --> 37:21.030
<i>We can always make it the truth.</i>

37:21.113 --> 37:23.658
We'll have to surprise him without
giving him a chance to counterattack

37:23.741 --> 37:25.159
in front of the entire nation.

37:28.955 --> 37:32.333
This is all manipulated!
This is a conspiracy against me!

37:32.416 --> 37:35.002
Wasn't it you, Minister,
who brought her here?

37:43.511 --> 37:46.097
MINISTER CHA INSTIGATES PERJURY

37:46.180 --> 37:47.682
Judge Kim!

37:48.683 --> 37:50.393
What is going on here?

37:52.061 --> 37:53.646
Don't worry too much.

37:53.729 --> 37:58.192
Well, Chairwoman Jung Seon-a
had asked for our full cooperation,

37:58.276 --> 38:00.152
so we did just that but Minister Cha is…

38:00.236 --> 38:03.114
Will this be okay? It should be, right?

38:04.031 --> 38:07.118
I also have a question for you, Minister.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.038
Do you remember this person?

38:11.747 --> 38:13.165
Please take a look.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.424
This man is a fraud who was
sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.639
He should be in prison now,
serving his term, right?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.185
Why are you asking me this?

38:34.061 --> 38:35.479
Of course he would be.

38:36.355 --> 38:37.315
Really?

38:51.954 --> 38:54.832
Then why is he here, and not in prison?

38:55.541 --> 38:57.501
Do you know anything about this, Minister?

39:01.756 --> 39:04.759
I don't know what this is about,

39:04.842 --> 39:06.886
but it has nothing to do with me.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.679
Is that right?

39:12.683 --> 39:14.018
Over to you.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.690
Minister, it's been a long time.

39:24.904 --> 39:28.449
Minister Cha Gyeong-hui got me out

39:29.116 --> 39:31.869
-in exchange for a large sum.
-Holy…

39:31.952 --> 39:36.123
<i>Right now in prison,
there is someone else who's replaced me.</i>

39:38.834 --> 39:39.919
Do Young-choon?

39:40.544 --> 39:42.296
How is he there?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.508
<i>-Did we ever meet?</i>
-I knew this would happen!

39:45.591 --> 39:47.927
<i>-Don't you remember?</i>
-Calm down.

39:48.010 --> 39:50.805
What about Mom? What will happen to Mom?

39:50.888 --> 39:54.266
-No, it'll be okay.
-What do we do?

39:54.350 --> 39:59.063
How dare you frame me
with the words of a fraud!

39:59.730 --> 40:02.525
This is a political attack against me!

40:03.567 --> 40:07.154
The Prosecution will uncover
the truth through an investigation.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.506
Minister Cha.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.593
Minister Cha, is it true
you received a building from him?

40:29.677 --> 40:32.471
-One comment, please.
-Who is it that's in prison?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.140
One comment please, Minister Cha.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.642
-Did you receive bribes?
-Minister Cha!

40:36.725 --> 40:40.938
-Who is it that's in prison?
-One comment, please!

40:41.021 --> 40:43.232
One comment please, Minister Cha!

40:43.315 --> 40:46.527
Contact Kang Yo-han.
I'd like a word with him in private.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.320
Yes, ma'am.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.036
And get me a pistol.

40:56.745 --> 40:57.705
Pardon?

40:57.788 --> 41:00.291
Tell them it's for security
and get me one.

41:01.917 --> 41:02.918
Yes.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.087
Yes, ma'am.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.344
One comment, please!

41:19.101 --> 41:20.686
<i>Hello, Minister.</i>

41:20.769 --> 41:22.188
You've gone mad, haven't you?

41:22.271 --> 41:24.023
How dare you stab my back?

41:24.106 --> 41:28.194
I know, right?
And I stabbed you pretty deep too.

41:29.445 --> 41:30.946
<i>You think I'll overlook this?</i>

41:31.572 --> 41:32.573
<i>Just you wait.</i>

41:32.656 --> 41:35.493
I'll expose you completely
for who you are!

41:36.869 --> 41:39.038
Well…

41:39.121 --> 41:41.999
But will they believe any of your claims?

41:42.082 --> 41:44.752
<i>When you have now become
an icon of manipulation?</i>

41:44.835 --> 41:47.087
-What did you say?
<i>-That's why…</i>

41:50.341 --> 41:52.760
you should've been nicer,

41:52.843 --> 41:54.720
to a lowly secretary like me.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.066
That wench!

42:40.432 --> 42:41.642
Good work.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.754
-Hey, Su-hyeon.
<i>-Hey, Ga-on.</i>

43:10.838 --> 43:13.007
<i>You just saw, didn't you?
Kang Yo-han had Do Young-choon.</i>

43:13.090 --> 43:15.217
Yes, I saw just now. On TV.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.720
Hey, then how can you stay so calm?

43:17.803 --> 43:20.389
I'm so glad. This is great news.

43:20.472 --> 43:22.933
<i>When I think about
all that you'd suffered…</i>

43:23.017 --> 43:26.353
Anyway, how did he even find out
where Do Young-choon was?

43:27.938 --> 43:30.190
Well… it worked out well
in the end, right?

43:30.274 --> 43:31.942
It's past us now,
so let's just forget about it.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.236
<i>What are you talking about?
This is only the beginning.</i>

43:34.320 --> 43:36.739
Ga-on, I'm going to put
that Cha Gyeong-hui

43:37.531 --> 43:39.325
before the court with my own hands.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.916
<i>I said we can't.</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:51.086
We don't have time to deal with this.
I'm hanging up.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.589
Minister Cha.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.719
One of the WAIS detectives
keeps wanting to barge in.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.346
Did you get what I asked you?

44:01.513 --> 44:02.598
Yes.

44:03.307 --> 44:04.558
I'll bring it to you now.

45:14.962 --> 45:15.963
Wow!

45:16.755 --> 45:20.259
No one would know even if
someone were to be killed here.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.969
And it's raining heavily too.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.932
What is your business?

45:27.891 --> 45:31.228
Why are you doing this to me?

45:32.229 --> 45:35.065
Did I ever wrong you, Judge Kang?

45:36.066 --> 45:37.860
Oh, that fire?

45:37.943 --> 45:41.613
I'm a victim myself.
What did I ever do so wrong?

45:41.697 --> 45:45.284
Or is this about that assemblyman
who took his own life?

45:46.201 --> 45:48.287
I was only following
the orders from above.

45:48.370 --> 45:51.123
All I did was to struggle
for survival in that organization

45:51.206 --> 45:53.292
because I had no connections
or anyone watching my back!

45:54.209 --> 45:56.545
How else could I have made it
to where I am today?

45:57.963 --> 46:01.049
You know what? My only sin…

46:01.758 --> 46:03.385
was that I fought for survival.

46:05.387 --> 46:06.472
All right?

46:08.307 --> 46:10.642
A power figure's self-pity…

46:11.310 --> 46:12.811
It's really hard to watch

46:13.562 --> 46:15.063
because it makes me puke.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.818
What did you say?

46:38.128 --> 46:39.171
Fine.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.089
Do as you wish then.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.260
You think you can bring me down
with this one surprise show?

46:45.886 --> 46:47.471
Of course it won't be easy.

46:48.263 --> 46:50.807
You'll buy time
with the excuse of a formal investigation

46:50.891 --> 46:53.685
and find a suitable scapegoat
to lay all the blame on.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.813
Then you'll claim it was
all a frame-up for political maneuvering.

46:56.897 --> 46:59.066
Aren't you an expert in that field?

46:59.816 --> 47:01.985
If you do know,
why did you even start this?

47:02.069 --> 47:05.280
Maybe you could stop
one or two arrows coming at you,

47:06.281 --> 47:09.117
but how will you stop hundreds
fired all at once?

47:09.201 --> 47:10.577
It won't be easy.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.747
This is only the beginning.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.959
Tell me what you want!

47:18.502 --> 47:20.671
You even launched a task force

47:20.754 --> 47:24.132
to dig up dirt on Heo Joong-se
and the others, right?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.219
Hand over that file to me,

47:27.302 --> 47:30.347
then I'll point you to a direction
where you can live, at least.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.602
A direction where I can live, at least?

47:35.686 --> 47:38.981
You think I'll be brought down so easily?

47:39.064 --> 47:43.151
How dare you…

47:43.235 --> 47:44.444
Really?

47:45.779 --> 47:46.822
All right, then.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.660
Give me a call if you change your mind.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.862
Honey, are you okay?

48:27.613 --> 48:29.698
What are we going to do?

48:29.781 --> 48:32.784
The whole world is talking about you!

48:41.501 --> 48:42.753
I'm sorry, Mom.

48:43.503 --> 48:44.838
It's all my fault.

48:48.091 --> 48:49.551
This is all because of me.

48:52.554 --> 48:54.389
Listen to me, both of you.

48:57.851 --> 48:59.895
Don't ever show your weak side.

49:00.687 --> 49:02.939
Only the weak get pushed around.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.609
I'm going to grit my teeth
and bear it to the end

49:06.943 --> 49:08.945
until I have all of them
kneeling before me.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.283
After all I went through
to get to where I am…

49:14.201 --> 49:15.327
That's right, Honey.

49:15.410 --> 49:17.496
You'll pull through this.

49:17.579 --> 49:18.997
You're a strong woman.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.001
I'm sorry.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.382
I know what you went through
to come all the way here…

49:29.466 --> 49:31.009
so I'm sorry.

49:35.472 --> 49:38.016
<i>We need to keep attacking her
without giving her a break.</i>

49:38.100 --> 49:40.727
<i>She's someone who'll gladly abandon
her own son for her ambitions.</i>

49:41.395 --> 49:42.938
She won't give up so easily.

49:43.855 --> 49:47.818
Still, I'm glad we went through
her past case records.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.071
Thank you, Judge Kim.

49:51.863 --> 49:53.073
Don't mention it.

49:53.156 --> 49:56.368
I know the lengths you went to,
visiting every one of those victims.

49:56.952 --> 49:59.621
We're not done yet
so save your thanks for later.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.040
Did you manage to convince the warden?

50:02.124 --> 50:05.544
Yes. He's completely intimidated,
so will do as you say.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.630
I've already given orders to
Cha Gyeong-hui's secretary too.

50:08.714 --> 50:10.382
So you can enter discreetly.

50:11.049 --> 50:13.969
If it all goes to plan,
she will crumble in the end.

50:15.595 --> 50:18.056
That's when I'll need to
reach out my hand,

50:18.140 --> 50:20.225
so she'll take it,
out of desperation to live.

50:20.851 --> 50:21.977
Minister Cha is here!

50:26.815 --> 50:29.443
Did you really arrange for
someone else to take Do's place?

50:29.526 --> 50:31.862
What about the allegations that
you forced perjury?

50:37.617 --> 50:40.370
I will reveal the truth
through the Prosecution.

50:41.079 --> 50:43.665
Minister Cha, tell us why.

50:49.212 --> 50:51.840
Minister Cha, please tell us the truth!

50:53.175 --> 50:54.801
Please tell us your reasons!

51:03.018 --> 51:06.188
Your broadcasting station has been
harassing me most tenaciously!

51:06.271 --> 51:07.814
Are you out of your mind?

51:07.898 --> 51:12.778
Minister, journalists these days
don't listen to higher-ups.

51:12.861 --> 51:16.198
Their youthful fervor and passion
is a real headache for us too.

51:18.575 --> 51:20.994
Those sons of a…

51:21.077 --> 51:23.622
Minister Cha, we have a problem.

51:23.705 --> 51:25.040
What is it this time?

51:25.957 --> 51:29.878
<i>The Warden of
the South Gyeonggi Correction Center</i>

51:29.961 --> 51:32.297
<i>has just come out honest
in front of the journalists</i>

51:32.380 --> 51:34.466
<i>regarding the case of the inmate switching
by Minister Cha.</i>

51:34.549 --> 51:36.760
<i>Is it true the orders
came from Minister Cha?</i>

51:38.220 --> 51:40.722
<i>Yes, the orders were
from Minister Cha Gyeong-hui.</i>

51:40.806 --> 51:43.141
<i>Is it true you were bribed or blackmailed?</i>

51:44.017 --> 51:45.310
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

51:45.393 --> 51:47.729
<i>However,
I could not withstand her blackmail.</i>

51:47.813 --> 51:49.189
That bastard…

51:50.232 --> 51:52.818
He said he'd do whatever
if I would promote him…

52:00.158 --> 52:01.117
Minister.

52:01.701 --> 52:03.829
It's a call
from the Central District Attorney.

52:04.746 --> 52:07.999
We'll need you to come in.

52:08.083 --> 52:11.711
-What?
<i>-We received 12 complaints.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:15.674
They're from the victims
and their families of the cases

52:15.757 --> 52:19.511
you'd investigated, and the allegations
include blackmail, coercion,

52:19.594 --> 52:21.972
<i>publication of facts of suspected a crime,
and the list goes on.</i>

52:23.139 --> 52:24.266
Prosecutor Kim.

52:25.308 --> 52:29.312
Have you forgotten
who put you in that seat?

52:29.396 --> 52:30.897
I'm sorry, Minister.

52:31.815 --> 52:35.443
But this is something
that's beyond my capacity.

52:36.361 --> 52:38.780
<i>Why not go by the books?</i>

52:47.038 --> 52:48.123
Get the car ready.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.668
-Where to?
-To the Blue House.

52:59.175 --> 53:02.846
Go on. Or are you not a fan of snacks?

53:02.929 --> 53:04.806
How did it come to this?

53:04.890 --> 53:07.392
You were due to move in here
two years later,

53:07.475 --> 53:10.312
so what on earth happened?

53:10.395 --> 53:14.733
My wife and I had been
extremely careful with the furniture

53:14.816 --> 53:17.903
for your sake you know, Minister Cha.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.529
I'll cut to the chase.

53:19.613 --> 53:22.407
No, you can state the prologue,
the subject, the conclusion…

53:22.490 --> 53:24.993
Chapter 1, 2, 3… everything!

53:25.076 --> 53:27.621
It's not like we'll be seeing
each other again, is it?

53:30.165 --> 53:32.834
There is a file I'd been working on.

53:39.674 --> 53:40.842
File?

53:40.926 --> 53:43.720
On the secret funds
for the previous presidential elections,

53:43.803 --> 53:47.015
and the reason why
the Gwanghwamun protests grew to a riot.

53:51.019 --> 53:52.562
But that's…

53:52.646 --> 53:54.981
That's breaking up the game.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.108
You're about to be arrested at any minute,

53:57.192 --> 53:59.861
so do you think you can take on
something as big as that?

54:00.570 --> 54:02.405
I didn't say I would.

54:02.489 --> 54:03.782
Then?

54:05.784 --> 54:07.869
I'll hand it over to Kang Yo-han.

54:12.707 --> 54:14.918
If you don’t want that,

54:15.001 --> 54:18.296
do whatever you can to stop all this.

54:18.380 --> 54:21.174
Even if it means rounding up
the NIS, or the army!

54:21.257 --> 54:23.093
Wait! All right.

54:23.176 --> 54:25.804
Wow, I didn't expect you to
take such a strong stance.

54:25.887 --> 54:28.223
But you know, I have this weird weakness

54:28.306 --> 54:30.558
where I can't make
important decisions on my own.

54:30.642 --> 54:33.478
One moment. Honey!

54:35.981 --> 54:38.692
Here, we have a guest.

54:39.651 --> 54:40.944
Gyeong-hui,

54:41.611 --> 54:44.447
just what is going on here?

54:45.991 --> 54:48.201
What the hell is this?

54:48.284 --> 54:51.871
Exactly. So let's talk about this
as parents of our children.

54:51.955 --> 54:55.959
Young-min and our Joon have been
best friends since they were young.

54:56.042 --> 55:00.046
Yes. Joon has been awfully
worried about Young-min.

55:00.922 --> 55:03.008
Because he's always been so lonely

55:03.675 --> 55:04.718
and sensitive.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.097
What is it that you want to say?

55:12.267 --> 55:15.353
Did you know, Gyeong-hui?

55:16.187 --> 55:17.480
That…

55:19.149 --> 55:21.776
he had been doing drugs
since he was in high school?

55:26.531 --> 55:30.035
I hear once you're addicted,
it's hard to quit.

55:30.118 --> 55:34.497
In fact, I found out that he laid
his hands on every type of drug.

55:34.581 --> 55:37.125
He's quite a junkie.

55:37.208 --> 55:40.879
No wonder he's been up to
such crazy things.

55:42.630 --> 55:46.051
So what about Young-min?

55:46.134 --> 55:48.011
What else?

55:48.094 --> 55:51.556
We'll have to go by the law,
as a lawful state.

55:51.639 --> 55:55.310
And that's your specialty. It looks like
he'll be in there for some time.

55:55.393 --> 55:58.271
But will that be okay?

55:58.354 --> 56:01.941
Wasn't Young-min
a nervous wreck ever since he was little?

56:02.025 --> 56:03.443
I'm worried.

56:04.110 --> 56:06.946
I hear he'd become
even bigger of a mess after he was flogged

56:07.030 --> 56:08.656
because of his mother.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.535
I totally sympathize as a mother myself.

56:13.536 --> 56:15.705
It's our children who are
most important, right?

56:17.165 --> 56:19.959
So have a good think about it, Gyeong-hui.

56:20.043 --> 56:21.461
Would you look at that, Honey?

56:21.544 --> 56:23.088
Her cup's about to break.

56:28.510 --> 56:31.262
Loosen your grip. You'll break it. Relax.

56:32.013 --> 56:33.014
Minister Cha.

56:33.723 --> 56:36.392
Cool your head and think rationally.

56:38.186 --> 56:39.479
For your son.

56:54.953 --> 56:56.955
I guess the conversation
didn't go too well.

57:05.713 --> 57:06.840
Who are you?

57:07.549 --> 57:08.883
Where is my secretary?

57:09.884 --> 57:11.553
Mr. Kim quit.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.350
Who are you?
And why are you driving my car?

57:18.309 --> 57:20.728
I'm someone who's been helping Judge Kang.

57:23.356 --> 57:25.024
This is your last chance, Minister.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.777
Have you made up your mind?

57:29.779 --> 57:32.449
The only person
who can put a stop to all this

57:32.532 --> 57:34.534
is Judge Kang Yo-han.

57:42.709 --> 57:43.918
Have we…

57:45.295 --> 57:46.796
ever met before?

57:47.589 --> 57:49.549
You seem awfully familiar.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.723
Do you remember the assemblyman

57:59.934 --> 58:01.394
you'd investigated?

58:08.526 --> 58:11.029
The one who took his life
after he was falsely accused.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.826
I was still in middle school
around that time.

58:21.289 --> 58:22.790
Really?

58:24.209 --> 58:26.044
So he had a son, did he?

58:36.054 --> 58:38.056
You take after your father.

58:59.452 --> 59:00.620
Who is it?

59:10.922 --> 59:14.509
I thought you might want to see me by now.
Or am I wrong?

59:21.057 --> 59:23.351
Because of the man you suck out
from the prison,

59:23.434 --> 59:26.604
I lost my parents.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.318
Remorse, apology…

59:32.402 --> 59:33.820
I don't expect them from you.

59:36.364 --> 59:37.615
Instead, cooperate.

59:38.491 --> 59:40.577
So we can catch bigger criminals.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.714
If I become a whistleblower,

59:53.506 --> 59:56.009
you'll pardon me, will you?

59:57.468 --> 59:59.387
Do you have any other options left?

1:00:43.598 --> 1:00:47.143
I'd like to think about it over a smoke.

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:51.689
Will you give me some time alone?

1:01:24.138 --> 1:01:27.350
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:29.894
ID, please.

1:01:31.938 --> 1:01:33.731
I'm Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon from WAIS.

1:01:35.733 --> 1:01:37.151
You're clear.

1:01:42.073 --> 1:01:45.201
2F MINISTER OF JUSTICE

1:01:45.284 --> 1:01:47.078
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

1:03:16.918 --> 1:03:18.211
<i>Young-min.</i>

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:24.008
Come here.

1:03:25.718 --> 1:03:26.969
Come here.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:39.398
I'm sorry, Mom. I…

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:42.068
I'm sorry.

1:04:17.895 --> 1:04:19.188
Young-min…

1:05:39.477 --> 1:05:41.354
First we…

1:05:42.271 --> 1:05:43.689
We need to find that file.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:04.168
Hands above your head, and step back.

1:06:10.466 --> 1:06:11.842
Kang Yo-han?

1:06:22.728 --> 1:06:24.021
Step back.

1:06:31.028 --> 1:06:32.697
You. Get up, now.

1:06:54.135 --> 1:06:55.636
Su-hyeon…

1:07:06.522 --> 1:07:10.276
THANK YOU TO JUNG EUN-PYO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:41.182
<i>I wish you were lonely like me,</i>

1:07:41.265 --> 1:07:42.558
<i>Young Master.</i>

1:07:42.641 --> 1:07:44.894
Do you even know what I'm suppressing
when I'm helping you?

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:47.021
Please leave Ga-on alone.

1:07:47.104 --> 1:07:49.482
Cut off Yoon Su-hyeon from your life.

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:52.485
<i>There is still one remaining threat
against the Foundation, isn't there?</i>

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:53.819
As a justice of the Supreme Court,

1:07:53.903 --> 1:07:56.363
<i>I call upon the disbandment of
the Department of Live Court Show.</i>

1:07:56.447 --> 1:07:57.615
Let's proceed with it.

1:07:57.698 --> 1:08:00.326
<i>-He must be up to something big.</i>
-Are you afraid?

1:08:00.409 --> 1:08:02.661
You think this battle is a joke, do you?

1:08:03.162 --> 1:08:04.538
<i>What's the meaning of this?</i>

1:08:04.622 --> 1:08:07.458
<i>You will need to go save
Judge Kim Ga-on too.</i>

1:08:07.541 --> 1:08:08.834
<i>No!</i>

1:08:09.460 --> 1:08:13.005
