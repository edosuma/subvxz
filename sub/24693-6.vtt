WEBVTT

00:00.302 --> 00:05.434
Please, Your Honor, don't
be blinded by my wife's fame.

00:05.434 --> 00:07.973
She's using my son as a weapon.

00:07.973 --> 00:11.947
Clay junior needs me.
This is parental alienation.

00:11.947 --> 00:15.747
As a father myself, my heart goes out.

00:15.747 --> 00:19.694
But it is my duty to act
in the best interests of the child.

00:19.694 --> 00:23.627
Therefore I am denying your motion
to amend visitation rights.

00:27.220 --> 00:31.326
Ocean. Ocean.

00:38.217 --> 00:40.506
Frye! Frye!

00:40.506 --> 00:42.048
I love my son.
You hear me?

00:42.048 --> 00:43.959
Darren, we speak only in court.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.589
- I've got something for you.
- Easy!

00:45.589 --> 00:48.835
- No one needs to get hurt here.
- No, no one does.

00:49.388 --> 00:51.844
- I want you to take this.
- What is this?

00:51.844 --> 00:55.817
It's sort of a brief to show you
my side of things.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:04.851 --> 01:09.239
It is too risky. He is making wild
accusations. I am out!

01:09.239 --> 01:11.462
Do what you have to do.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.246
I... I understand how angry you are.

01:15.246 --> 01:17.837
I'm... I'm angry too.

01:17.837 --> 01:21.046
I'm trying to figure out
how all this happened.

01:30.513 --> 01:33.063
Jay. We need to talk.

01:33.063 --> 01:35.494
Monica, I have a couple waiting.

01:35.494 --> 01:38.108
You cancel them or I will.

01:38.412 --> 01:42.288
She's losing it.
She just walked in on me in session.

01:42.288 --> 01:45.359
You're her boss, Jay.
You can't let her just...

01:45.359 --> 01:47.883
Don't worry.
I won't.

01:47.883 --> 01:49.714
It's over.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.990
My hero.

01:57.793 --> 02:00.244
He's a director.
She's an actress.

02:00.244 --> 02:02.572
It is narcissism on parade.

02:02.572 --> 02:06.096
- Monica, you're not coming?
- I have to finish this.

02:06.096 --> 02:08.804
Give my rubber chicken to someone else.

02:09.017 --> 02:11.955
A situation with your patient?
I thought you talked to Jay.

02:11.955 --> 02:14.613
He dies Jackie's involved.

02:14.613 --> 02:16.926
Give my regards to the assemblymen.

02:16.926 --> 02:20.990
Mom, leftover Thai in the fridge,
how old is it?

02:20.990 --> 02:24.245
How about rubber chicken instead?

03:28.900 --> 03:30.875
Monica Frye, couples counselor.

03:30.875 --> 03:34.447
Her husband Harvey Frye is
a Brooklyn Supreme Court judge.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.450
The judge find the body?

03:35.450 --> 03:37.565
He and his daughter coming home
from a fundraiser.

03:37.565 --> 03:40.339
Your partner had me check their alibi.

03:40.339 --> 03:43.473
She got here that early?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.386
So, Logan?

03:53.386 --> 03:55.781
Let me get you up to speed here.
Two shots.

03:55.781 --> 03:57.916
First one grazed shoulder.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.921
Yeah, she touched the wound,

04:00.921 --> 04:02.995
turn around grabbed the sink.

04:02.995 --> 04:04.669
Second shot killed her.

04:04.669 --> 04:06.052
Officer.

04:06.052 --> 04:10.538
Hollow point, Teflon-clad.
Kitchen window didn't shatter.

04:10.841 --> 04:13.207
These look like KTW's.

04:13.207 --> 04:17.541
Brass core, military
and law enforcement use only.

04:17.541 --> 04:21.195
Banned to the public.
Shooter was a pro with access.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.226
The thing I don't get...

04:22.226 --> 04:25.270
He'd a pro...
how'd he miss the first shot?

04:26.695 --> 04:28.754
You don't waste time, do you, Falacci?

04:28.754 --> 04:30.638
Not on the job.

04:31.114 --> 04:32.899
By the way... Falacci, what is that?

04:32.899 --> 04:36.397
Some kind of fair-haired
Greenwich Connecticut Italian name?

04:36.397 --> 04:39.511
Father's Sicilian.
Mother's a Mick. No contest.

04:39.511 --> 04:40.773
Hey!

04:40.773 --> 04:42.739
- What's he doing in here?
- The judge asked...

04:42.739 --> 04:45.367
He asked if he could hose down
the crime scene? That okay too?

04:45.367 --> 04:48.142
Get him out of here.
He's a suspect.

04:49.401 --> 04:52.068
Don't look at my partner.
He's got my back, not yours.

04:52.068 --> 04:55.842
It's all right, Campesi.
Go on, get him out of here.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.263
Take a cigarette break,
would you, Falacci?

05:03.263 --> 05:07.619
The last thing you wanna do
is piss off a Supreme Court judge.

05:12.856 --> 05:14.596
Judge Frye?

05:14.596 --> 05:16.761
I'm Detective Mike Logan.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.051
Your partner, she had no right.

05:20.051 --> 05:22.420
My wife is dead.

05:23.258 --> 05:25.184
I understand.

05:31.077 --> 05:34.180
25 years we're married.

05:34.999 --> 05:37.749
You went to a fundraiser tonight,
and your wife stayed home.

05:37.749 --> 05:40.007
She had a situation at work.

05:40.007 --> 05:44.273
And her work, was this a clinic
or a private practice?

05:44.273 --> 05:46.296
The Alberstein Institute.

05:46.296 --> 05:50.447
Her clients, when, uh,
she couldn't make them happy,

05:50.447 --> 05:53.165
it ate her up inside.

05:55.455 --> 06:00.157
You think any of these clients were unhappy
enough to take it out on her personally?

06:02.361 --> 06:04.738
She didn't talk specifics.

06:04.738 --> 06:07.782
Patient confidentiality.

06:08.654 --> 06:15.181
But with, uh, couples counseling,
there are anger management issues.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.936
Her files are at the institute.

06:23.188 --> 06:25.136
Tech is working on her laptop.

06:25.136 --> 06:29.043
Every file is password protected
except for that letter to her boss.

06:29.043 --> 06:31.614
She was home last night writing it.

06:31.614 --> 06:34.025
She's accusing a fellow therapist,

06:34.025 --> 06:36.680
Jackie Gold, of going through her files.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.642
One of Monica's patients claimed
that sensitive information

06:39.642 --> 06:44.382
he revealed in one-on-one therapy was
leaked to his wife's divorce attorney.

06:44.953 --> 06:47.345
"Client X."
She's even discreet in her letter.

06:47.345 --> 06:50.811
So you two have to discreetly
finesse access from her files.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.522
- And screen every therapist that...
- Don't rule out judge Frye.

06:53.522 --> 06:55.305
He could be piggybacking on whatever...

06:55.305 --> 06:58.494
At the institute.

06:58.724 --> 07:01.634
Logan, the judge arouse your suspicion?

07:01.634 --> 07:04.073
His alibi checked out.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.184
He seemed shaken.

07:05.184 --> 07:07.615
The hit was professional.
The judge could have hired someone.

07:07.615 --> 07:09.845
Except she was supposed to go
with him to the benefit.

07:09.845 --> 07:12.173
Judge could have picked a fight
so that she'd stay home.

07:12.173 --> 07:15.496
Well, he certainly picked
a fight with the chief of D's.

07:15.496 --> 07:17.178
Come here.

07:20.151 --> 07:23.016
Which one of you kicked
the judge out of his own home?

07:23.016 --> 07:25.259
Guilty or not,
he had no right to be there.

07:25.259 --> 07:27.256
I'm not questioning what you did, Logan.

07:27.256 --> 07:29.912
It's how you did it.
He's a Supreme Court judge.

07:29.912 --> 07:33.123
I threw Frye out.
Not Logan.

07:33.443 --> 07:38.597
The judge is the victim's husband.
That makes him the lead suspect.

07:39.316 --> 07:42.331
You made the right call, detective.
But this isn't Brooklyn North.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.793
This is Major Case.

07:43.793 --> 07:46.062
You're dealing with
a higher class of criminal.

07:46.062 --> 07:49.344
What are you saying,
I should give him the run of the place?

07:50.583 --> 07:51.639
There's a protocol when you...

07:51.639 --> 07:54.984
When you secure a crime scene, really?

07:54.984 --> 07:57.457
There's also a protocol with me, Detective.

07:57.457 --> 08:01.219
Well, it looks like, uh,
IRA's got something.

08:02.578 --> 08:05.688
We get it.
Point taken, Captain.

08:08.125 --> 08:11.361
I don't need anyone telling me...

08:12.175 --> 08:14.025
What?

08:14.025 --> 08:17.455
I'm just not used to being
the voice of reason.

08:20.414 --> 08:23.771
Clearly Monica had a lot of anger,
but I never saw this letter.

08:23.771 --> 08:24.613
We know you didn't.

08:24.613 --> 08:26.670
She was writing it right
before she was murdered.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.598
So you see.

08:27.598 --> 08:30.069
But we did see the e-mails
she sent to Jackie Gold.

08:30.069 --> 08:32.664
- She BCC'd you on those.
- She did.

08:32.664 --> 08:35.592
And I assured her that doctor Gold
never rifled through her files,

08:35.592 --> 08:37.780
but Monica had become obsessed.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.263
All right, well, this "Client X,"

08:40.263 --> 08:42.491
we're gonna need his files
and his contact info.

08:42.491 --> 08:44.548
I can't.
Confidentiality.

08:44.548 --> 08:48.382
Jay. Monica's 3:00 just showed.

08:48.382 --> 08:51.177
Oh, I didn't realize.

08:51.177 --> 08:55.399
Can you inform them, Jackie?

08:59.563 --> 09:01.301
That's doctor Gold?

09:01.301 --> 09:02.831
How long have you worked with her?

09:02.831 --> 09:06.637
Six years.
Excellent therapist.

09:07.443 --> 09:09.468
If there's anything else
I can do for you...

09:09.468 --> 09:11.185
Falacci.

09:12.804 --> 09:17.813
Is this a woman's hair?

09:20.903 --> 09:24.948
Dyed blonde... with a dark root,
just like Dr. Gold.

09:24.948 --> 09:26.741
She's often in my office working.

09:26.741 --> 09:29.823
With her back pressed up
against the wall?

09:30.167 --> 09:35.582
Let's see.
She's about my height in heels.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.086
Probably kept her heels on, though, huh?

09:40.086 --> 09:41.646
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.

09:41.646 --> 09:43.410
Where were you last night?

09:43.410 --> 09:45.012
Just so you know, Doc,

09:45.012 --> 09:48.051
CSU is gonna work through this room
with a fine-tooth comb.

09:48.051 --> 09:53.778
Talking about, like,
the couch, chair, rug...

09:53.778 --> 09:55.157
Enough.

09:55.157 --> 09:58.950
Dr. Gold and I were working
on her new book till late.

09:58.950 --> 10:02.338
Even so, you two are still
our lead suspects

10:02.338 --> 10:06.663
unless you can produce client X's file.

10:12.532 --> 10:15.579
- I never gave you this.
- Got it.

10:16.356 --> 10:18.426
Appreciate it, Doc.

10:18.426 --> 10:20.537
You can let yourselves out.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.997
Oh, Client X.
Okay...

10:24.997 --> 10:27.191
okay.

10:29.104 --> 10:32.430
What? Don't tell me, NYPD?

10:32.430 --> 10:34.501
FBI.

10:39.002 --> 10:41.119
Agent Billings?

10:41.119 --> 10:42.249
Can I help you?

10:42.249 --> 10:43.872
Oh, hey. How you doing?

10:43.872 --> 10:45.610
Detectives Logan, Falacci.

10:45.610 --> 10:49.013
I just wanna ask you a few questions
about a suspect you might know.

10:49.013 --> 10:50.218
Suspect? Who?

10:50.218 --> 10:52.103
Actually, a victim.

10:52.103 --> 10:55.436
Monica Frye was shot and killed
Thursday night.

10:55.436 --> 10:56.946
Yeah?

10:56.946 --> 10:58.856
Your therapist?

10:58.856 --> 11:01.207
Former therapist.

11:01.207 --> 11:03.572
Off the record, okay?

11:03.572 --> 11:06.184
It is if you didn't kill Monica Frye.

11:06.184 --> 11:08.614
Zena is a therapeutic counselor.

11:08.614 --> 11:10.517
In black latex and spike heels?

11:10.517 --> 11:13.521
We were working
on my control issues, okay?

11:13.521 --> 11:16.048
Somehow your wife's
divorce attorney found out.

11:16.048 --> 11:18.611
And you only person you told was Frye.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.331
And she was shot by a pro.

11:20.331 --> 11:25.373
Look, I was on duty Thursday night.
My supervisor will confirm.

11:26.632 --> 11:28.231
Look, I'm not your guy.

11:28.231 --> 11:30.865
I feel guilty I even accused Dr. Frye.

11:30.865 --> 11:34.320
I thought it was her fault.
I did some digging.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.634
Thursday night I found out my wife
had hired a PI named Ronald Hawk.

11:37.634 --> 11:40.148
Ronnie Hawk?
Ex-CIA?

11:40.148 --> 11:42.009
Yeah.

11:44.542 --> 11:49.702
So my client's spouse thinks
I bugged his shrink's office.

11:49.702 --> 11:51.709
You know how many times
I've heard that one?

11:51.709 --> 11:53.521
Well, did you?

11:53.915 --> 11:57.398
I'm in the business 20 years.
I don't need to do anything illegal.

11:57.398 --> 12:01.077
My gut pegged Agent Billings
as a pervert from day one.

12:01.077 --> 12:03.944
Uh, Jose Seijas, Detective?

12:03.944 --> 12:06.780
It's Dominican.
Not Cuban.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.248
I'll take a rain check.

12:09.248 --> 12:11.682
How about you, Miss Falacci?

12:11.871 --> 12:13.715
Okay.

12:13.715 --> 12:16.466
You're a smart man, Mr. Hawk.

12:16.466 --> 12:18.706
How do you think his wife's
divorce attorney

12:18.706 --> 12:22.567
found out Agent Billings was
getting whipped for kicks?

12:22.567 --> 12:27.266
Hey, we're all detectives,
after the same thing, the truth.

12:27.266 --> 12:31.481
Until I started digging, no one knew
the Judge's wife was Agent Billings' therapist.

12:31.481 --> 12:34.303
A total conflict of interest.

12:35.805 --> 12:39.913
Are you saying that Judge Frye was
scheduled to hear the Billings' divorce?

12:40.272 --> 12:45.984
I point that out to my client's attorney,
he insists that the Judge recuse himself.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.942
It must have slipped my mind.
I've been overwrought.

12:50.942 --> 12:54.408
But yes, I did recuse myself recently.

12:54.408 --> 12:56.773
He's an FBI Agent.
Your wife mention him?

12:56.773 --> 12:59.686
He accused her of leaking
information about him

12:59.686 --> 13:02.566
and a hooker, or a dominatrix,
something unsavory.

13:02.566 --> 13:05.014
She offered you that information?

13:05.014 --> 13:08.134
I thought she was big on patient privacy.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.047
She came home.

13:10.047 --> 13:12.459
She was upset.

13:12.884 --> 13:14.565
I asked her what it was about.
She told me.

13:14.565 --> 13:16.476
You've never discussed a case
with your wife?

13:16.476 --> 13:20.266
- No.
- So she told you about the dominatrix.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.149
And you sold that tidbit
to his wife's lawyer.

13:23.149 --> 13:26.689
- You are out of order, Detective.
- Judge, this man's a suspect.

13:26.689 --> 13:29.830
And we have to track how his file leaked.

13:30.365 --> 13:35.508
Well, I might have... I may have
talked to a lawyer on the golf course.

13:37.366 --> 13:42.893
25 years we were together.
I cooked for her every night.

13:43.362 --> 13:47.074
I'm sorry, Judge, but we had to ask.

13:49.869 --> 13:53.155
Excuse me, but you said
that you cooked for her?

13:53.155 --> 13:57.187
Monica could do anything
except boil water.

13:57.187 --> 14:00.195
And she was shot in your kitchen.

14:00.623 --> 14:03.414
Ever occur to you that she wasn't
the target, but you were?

14:03.414 --> 14:05.026
Me?

14:05.026 --> 14:07.498
Why would anyone want me dead?

14:07.498 --> 14:09.707
Judge Frye should rot in hell.

14:09.707 --> 14:11.618
He says I'm not fit to be a mother.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.218
My husband gambles, drinks,
and I am unfit?

14:14.218 --> 14:17.273
Okay, I got it, Habiba, so then you left
the threatening messages.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.694
He says I am an uneducated woman.
I should find work.

14:19.694 --> 14:21.848
Then he took my girls away.

14:21.848 --> 14:23.636
Your husband wanted custody?

14:23.636 --> 14:25.707
He just wanted to see me suffer.

14:25.707 --> 14:27.306
In court he laughed.

14:27.306 --> 14:30.081
"Welcome to American," he says,
"everyone can be bought."

14:30.081 --> 14:33.730
Now, he could said that to just,
you know, intimidate you.

14:33.730 --> 14:39.373
His sister, she says he brags
about how he was an in with the Judge.

14:43.714 --> 14:49.047
Thursday night Habiba Morelle was
working a 14-hour shift as a nanny.

14:49.047 --> 14:51.549
She doesn't have the resources
to hire a hit man.

14:51.549 --> 14:53.568
Okay, we're back to Judge Frye.

14:53.568 --> 14:55.309
What do we know about his resources?

14:55.309 --> 14:59.482
He drives a ten-year-old Beamer.
He lives in the house he grew up in.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.269
If he's on the take, uh, it's well hidden.

15:02.269 --> 15:07.017
So far I've procured 21 divorce proceedings
the Judge has ruled on.

15:07.017 --> 15:09.825
In all of these the spouses have
to provide financials.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.841
If he's in the pocket of a specific firm,
maybe he overreached.

15:12.841 --> 15:14.810
No, we checked that too.

15:14.810 --> 15:18.365
Six lawyers, four firms.
No obvious connection to the Judge.

15:18.365 --> 15:23.627
I did get two attorneys to admit they won
because one side just folded.

15:23.627 --> 15:25.938
Protracted legal battles,
and out of nowhere,

15:25.938 --> 15:27.742
one spouse just caved.

15:27.742 --> 15:29.812
No one caves in a divorce.

15:29.812 --> 15:33.953
Unless their ex has dirt on them.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.431
Falacci, let me see those.

15:37.431 --> 15:39.887
The files.
Just give me a bunch.

15:51.435 --> 15:54.785
It's not the lawyer the winners
have in common.

15:55.819 --> 15:58.354
It's the PI.

16:05.853 --> 16:08.396
You look beautiful.

16:09.189 --> 16:12.635
I can't stand the stink of those.

16:16.452 --> 16:18.958
I got a call from Judge Frye.

16:18.958 --> 16:22.355
The cops think whoever killed
his wife meant to kill him.

16:22.355 --> 16:23.596
What did he tell them?

16:23.596 --> 16:27.233
That he doesn't have an enemy
in the world.

16:29.444 --> 16:31.704
Lock the door.

16:37.899 --> 16:40.592
I am familiar with these cases.

16:40.592 --> 16:42.698
That's the greedy one.

16:42.698 --> 16:44.541
Never shares.

16:44.541 --> 16:47.321
Save some for your girlfriend.

16:47.562 --> 16:49.541
But, uh...

16:50.128 --> 16:52.002
I can't compromise confidentiality.

16:52.002 --> 16:55.943
Okay, well, off the record.
We noticed a pattern.

16:55.943 --> 16:57.362
You mean my clients win?

16:57.362 --> 17:00.114
Especially when the case goes
before Judge Frye.

17:00.114 --> 17:02.532
I don't deal with the Judge.
I deal with counsel.

17:02.532 --> 17:06.268
My clients win because I find proof
that their spouses are undesirables.

17:06.268 --> 17:09.354
- What's this about?
- The shooting at the Judge's house.

17:09.354 --> 17:13.277
We think he was the target,
not the wife.

17:13.277 --> 17:17.662
Well, it couldn't be one of my clients
because, as you say, they always win.

17:17.662 --> 17:21.727
Come on, Hawk.
We're all detectives here.

17:21.727 --> 17:25.770
What's your, uh, what's your gut say?

17:29.408 --> 17:32.938
You're talking about
the father of my child.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.514
I don't believe it.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.679
Clay did make threats, Christine.

17:39.333 --> 17:43.214
I'm worried for little Clay
if this leaks out.

17:43.214 --> 17:47.470
We're celebrities.
It's open season on people like us.

17:47.470 --> 17:49.603
It won't leak, honey.

17:49.603 --> 17:52.065
- Is that clear, detectives?
- Absolutely.

17:52.065 --> 17:58.438
Ms. Mayfield, we understand
that Mr. Darren threatened Judge Frye.

17:58.438 --> 18:00.811
He did... he did, yes,
on my answering machine.

18:00.811 --> 18:03.840
It was, um, pretty disturbing.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.850
Is there any chance you saved it?

18:08.692 --> 18:12.696
I detest confrontation of any kind.

18:14.398 --> 18:16.793
But...

18:17.124 --> 18:21.235
um, I'm in the fight of my life.

18:27.381 --> 18:29.726
You think I don't know
what's going on, Chrissy?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.976
Every time that Judge rules in your favor,

18:31.976 --> 18:34.528
do you spread your legs, or do
you just get on your knees?

18:34.528 --> 18:37.186
This is Clay junior
you're taking away from me.

18:37.186 --> 18:38.820
My only son.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.911
You're not gonna get away with it,
sweetheart, and neither is Frye!

18:41.911 --> 18:44.879
Next time that water buffalo
climbs on top of you,

18:44.879 --> 18:47.491
He better watch his back!

18:47.491 --> 18:50.601
Nice, I guess we found our plaintiff
with the anger management issues.

18:50.601 --> 18:53.070
And the wife just happened to save this?

18:53.070 --> 18:55.345
She said she was very worried
about it leaking out.

18:55.345 --> 18:57.418
You mean worried it wouldn't get out.

18:57.418 --> 18:59.994
Somehow it was up
on Youtube this morning.

18:59.994 --> 19:03.173
Not it's everywhere.
The press is having a field day.

19:03.173 --> 19:07.483
Wow, okay, so Christine used us
as a cover to leak the tape.

19:07.483 --> 19:09.976
- Scorched earth, huh?
- How's his alibi?

19:09.976 --> 19:12.716
Clay refuses to talk
without an arrest warrant.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.349
A real drama king.

19:14.349 --> 19:17.622
Start with a search warrant.
That might be enough to shake him up.

19:17.873 --> 19:20.896
You're looking for a gun here?
I'm a pacifist.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.196
Didn't you see my benefit,
"No more guns live"?

19:23.196 --> 19:24.803
It was televised on Bravo!

19:24.803 --> 19:26.938
I missed that.
I did hear your tape.

19:26.938 --> 19:29.078
What... hey, that was taken out of context.

19:29.078 --> 19:31.931
- I was not threatening the Judge.
- Carlson.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.817
Hey, that's my boy's.
Leave it alone.

19:34.817 --> 19:36.736
Well, look what I found.

19:36.736 --> 19:39.831
A gun in my boy's bag!
That crosses the line.

19:39.831 --> 19:41.148
I'll kill her.
I'll kill her.

19:41.148 --> 19:43.181
- Clay. Visualize.
- And I'll take...

19:43.181 --> 19:45.215
Ocean. Ocean.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.974
Ocean, ocean, ocean.

19:48.358 --> 19:51.031
- Ocean.
- Ocean.

19:51.031 --> 19:53.246
You do realize you're up for murder?

19:53.246 --> 19:55.764
Come on. What's my motivation?

19:55.764 --> 19:58.777
Why shoot the wife?
Why keep the gun?

19:58.777 --> 20:00.857
- Didn't you say this was professional...
- Whoa, whoa!

20:00.857 --> 20:02.794
- We wanna believe you.
- Okay.

20:02.794 --> 20:05.340
Can't confirm your alibi.

20:05.796 --> 20:09.593
How well did you know your date?

20:09.593 --> 20:11.074
Let me level with you.

20:11.074 --> 20:13.175
I'm gonna... you know.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.250
I met Tracey that night.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.425
Cute little brunette.
You know what I mean?

20:18.425 --> 20:21.013
A real cinephile.
Knew all my work.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.346
Even "Us, Again."

20:22.346 --> 20:26.527
Oh, "Us, Again."
My most personal film. You know.

20:26.527 --> 20:28.020
Completely misunderstood
by the critics.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.374
And Tracey understood it,

20:29.374 --> 20:32.322
so you took her home
and had sex with her.

20:37.334 --> 20:39.491
Anybody see you two leave together?

20:39.491 --> 20:43.088
The way I'm hounded
in the Tabloids...

20:43.088 --> 20:48.371
No. I had her wait at the bar for
ten minutes to avoid the Paparazzi.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.469
The Paparazzi, soulless maggots.

20:50.469 --> 20:53.171
Miserable, morbid bloodsuckers,
leeching off people...

20:53.171 --> 20:56.500
Clay, Clay.
Are you listening to me?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.538
Yes.

20:58.538 --> 21:00.716
- You are in big trouble.
- I know that.

21:00.716 --> 21:03.575
- We've got bad alibi...
- Okay.

21:03.575 --> 21:05.003
Threats...

21:05.003 --> 21:06.223
Murder weapon.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.736
I didn't need to shoot the Judge.

21:09.486 --> 21:11.628
- I was blackmailing him.
- Clay, what are you...

21:11.628 --> 21:12.586
No ocean.

21:12.586 --> 21:14.539
We wanna hear this.
Go ahead.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.970
One of the bailiffs, a fan, tipped me off.

21:17.970 --> 21:21.278
Said that Frye took gifts to fix cases.

21:21.278 --> 21:25.295
That Thursday, I followed Frye
to the street.

21:25.295 --> 21:27.290
I gave him a letter threatening to out him.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.031
He called me that night,

21:29.031 --> 21:32.320
and he swore that he would
rule in my favor.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.668
Did anybody see
you two talking together?

21:35.668 --> 21:36.985
Yes.

21:36.985 --> 21:40.517
The soulless maggots
snapped a few shots.

21:41.435 --> 21:44.974
Okay, we spoke.
He was stalking me.

21:44.974 --> 21:47.667
He accuses you of taking bribes?

21:47.667 --> 21:51.161
I decide my cases
on their merits, Miss.

21:51.161 --> 21:53.326
I've gone through your cases, Your Honor.

21:53.326 --> 21:56.957
You seem to find merits whenever
Ronnie Hawk asks you to.

21:56.957 --> 21:59.045
You're attacking me?

21:59.045 --> 22:02.348
My wife is dead.
I can barely make it through the day.

22:02.348 --> 22:04.418
You have your gun.
You've got the killer.

22:04.418 --> 22:06.317
We're not so sure, Judge.

22:06.317 --> 22:09.002
Look, if you're on the take,
I don't give a rat's ass.

22:09.002 --> 22:13.503
The one thing I do believe
that you told us is that you love Monica.

22:15.386 --> 22:17.117
She was my life.

22:17.117 --> 22:20.213
Yeah, and if Clay did convince
you to reverse,

22:20.213 --> 22:22.451
he's got no motive.

22:22.451 --> 22:25.589
Don't let someone get away
with killing her.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.418
Okay.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.826
He made some wild accusations.

22:32.826 --> 22:35.577
I decided given his temper
and his celebrity,

22:35.577 --> 22:38.968
I didn't need the grief.
I called him that afternoon.

22:39.197 --> 22:42.226
I told him that I would reverse myself.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.940
Who else did you tell?

22:46.344 --> 22:49.198
Don't thank me. That was good
detective work, arresting Clay.

22:49.198 --> 22:50.670
Yeah, but you led us to him.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.421
We were hoping you could
give us some insight.

22:53.421 --> 22:55.344
What's with all these adapters?

22:55.344 --> 22:58.843
I travel a lot,
tracking offshore accounts.

22:58.843 --> 23:01.189
What do you want to know about Clay?

23:01.341 --> 23:03.679
Yeah, we're having a problem
with his motive.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.457
Motive?

23:05.823 --> 23:08.503
He's been threatening
the Judge for years.

23:08.503 --> 23:10.499
He goes off when he loses.

23:10.499 --> 23:13.239
- And he was losing bad.
- That's what we thought too,

23:13.239 --> 23:16.423
but it turns out the Judge was about
to rule in Clay's favor.

23:16.423 --> 23:18.474
And Clay knew that.

23:18.474 --> 23:22.860
- Clay tell you that?
- Actually, Judge Frye told us.

23:24.331 --> 23:26.674
So this is news to you?

23:26.674 --> 23:28.035
You're pausing.

23:28.035 --> 23:31.230
Trying to figure out what else
the Judge told us?

23:31.230 --> 23:33.889
You're fishing.
Trying to get me to show my hand.

23:33.889 --> 23:35.644
We already know it, Hawk.

23:35.644 --> 23:37.192
You see, the Judge also told us

23:37.192 --> 23:41.415
that you knew he reversed himself
five hours before his wife was shot.

23:41.415 --> 23:46.742
How did Christine react when she learned
her judicial winning streak was over?

23:50.809 --> 23:52.989
Let me tell you about Christine.

23:52.989 --> 23:55.855
Clay's put her through hell and back.

23:55.855 --> 23:58.951
The first time they were married,
he thought she was having an affair.

23:58.951 --> 24:01.932
He drives six hours to location,
kicks down the trailer door,

24:01.932 --> 24:04.356
tries to flush her costar down the toilet.

24:04.356 --> 24:07.422
- He's Loony Tooney.
- And she's married him three times.

24:07.422 --> 24:10.521
She's a loyal, caring person.

24:10.521 --> 24:12.889
And they have a child together.

24:14.553 --> 24:17.293
Look, whatever the Judge told me,
I kept in confidence.

24:17.293 --> 24:20.795
If Clay got to him,
Christine had no idea.

24:20.795 --> 24:24.970
Well, then I guess you know
what my next question is going to be.

24:24.970 --> 24:27.211
The night of the murder
I was at my office the whole time.

24:27.211 --> 24:29.916
Car never left the garage.

24:30.591 --> 24:33.667
- Working late, huh?
- I fell asleep.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.706
Call me if I can be of any more help.

24:35.706 --> 24:37.735
What happened to your fish?

24:37.735 --> 24:40.369
You seemed pretty attached to them.

24:40.369 --> 24:45.368
One of them died, and
the other one just, uh, gave up.

24:52.377 --> 24:56.094
"Clay Darren Inks Deal to
Helm $100 Mil Thriller"

24:56.503 --> 25:00.209
Mommy's meeting may take a while.
Drive CJ to Starbucks.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.569
Get a strawberry Frappuccino.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.908
How long will I have to wait?

25:07.227 --> 25:09.223
And a cookie.

25:27.407 --> 25:30.623
Did you come here to gloat?

25:32.003 --> 25:37.005
So, Clay, tell me about the new movie.

25:42.699 --> 25:46.464
So you're saying because Hawk
has foreign adapters in his office,

25:46.464 --> 25:50.004
and he emptied out his fish tank,
he's planning to flee the country?

25:50.004 --> 25:51.094
Not by himself.

25:51.094 --> 25:53.133
We checked his phone records.
All ten of them.

25:53.133 --> 25:55.553
He's been making calls
to various consulates.

25:55.553 --> 25:58.274
I ran a check on countries
with no extradition treaties.

25:58.274 --> 26:01.856
Most of them you wouldn't
want to go to, but...

26:01.856 --> 26:03.177
I called the airlines.

26:03.177 --> 26:05.778
Three tickets to the Maldives
Islands one way.

26:05.778 --> 26:08.774
Purchased a day after
the Judge's wife was killed.

26:08.774 --> 26:11.090
Hawk's dumb enough to think
she'll run away with him?

26:11.090 --> 26:12.486
He's in love with her.

26:12.486 --> 26:14.733
He's not stupid enough to lie to us.

26:14.733 --> 26:17.718
The only time he did was
to protect her.

26:17.718 --> 26:20.364
I wonder if she feels the same way.

26:21.007 --> 26:24.170
The Maldives, sure?
He wanted to open up a bait shop.

26:24.170 --> 26:27.508
Did he mention to you that
he bought three plane tickets?

26:27.508 --> 26:29.900
Well, he has a lot of friends.

26:30.649 --> 26:35.663
Well, no. The other two were
for you and Clay JR.

26:35.663 --> 26:40.100
Oh, well.
That's just sad.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.591
Hawk was planning
on running away with you.

26:43.591 --> 26:46.320
Mr. Hawk may have misinterpreted
our relationship.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.701
This is not the first time
this has happened to me.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.497
How in love with you was he?

27:02.637 --> 27:05.376
If I tell you the truth,

27:05.376 --> 27:07.879
can you guarantee my safety?

27:07.879 --> 27:09.994
Absolutely.

27:12.863 --> 27:16.505
Hawk called me to his office...

27:16.505 --> 27:20.461
And told me that he shot
the Judge's wife...

27:22.524 --> 27:25.010
For me.

27:26.328 --> 27:30.672
He said we were gonna frame Clay
just to get him out of our lives.

27:30.672 --> 27:32.401
And you agreed to this?

27:32.401 --> 27:37.420
Hawk had a sweater of mine
with gun residue on it.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.243
He said that if I didn't play along,
that I would go down too.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.033
Didn't you say Hawk was
in love with you?

27:44.321 --> 27:46.778
So were my stalkers.

27:53.450 --> 27:56.933
I've been living in hell.

27:58.561 --> 28:01.296
Clay is in prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

28:01.296 --> 28:06.654
And where were you while Hawk was off
shooting the Judge's wife?

28:07.452 --> 28:10.221
I was with Clay.

28:11.806 --> 28:17.469
We were having, um,
one of our reconciliations.

28:18.162 --> 28:21.513
Hawk would've killed me.

28:22.377 --> 28:26.321
And I begged Clay not to say anything.

28:29.474 --> 28:32.043
Yes, Christine was with me that night.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.423
We banged in the Jacuzzi.

28:34.892 --> 28:37.811
- Why didn't you tell us this before?
- Hawk.

28:37.811 --> 28:40.358
Christine is so afraid of him.

28:40.358 --> 28:42.464
So you let her frame you for murder?

28:42.464 --> 28:45.493
No, me and Christine,
one week we want to kill each other.

28:45.493 --> 28:48.604
The next week we can't keep
our hands off each other.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.649
I knew I wasn't going to prison.

28:50.649 --> 28:52.866
Yeah. Right.

28:52.866 --> 28:57.760
But what I've been doing here is immersing
myself in the feel of this place.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.265
My next flick is about an ex-cop
on the hook for murder,

29:01.265 --> 29:04.183
so while I'm here, it's, like...

29:04.183 --> 29:06.123
I am that guy.

29:06.123 --> 29:08.287
Clay,

29:08.287 --> 29:10.986
you gotta wake up.

29:12.156 --> 29:13.955
You can't still think I'm guilty.

29:13.955 --> 29:15.500
He framed you pretty good.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.700
The murder weapon was
in your son's closet.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.568
Your boy tell you how it got there?

29:22.847 --> 29:25.514
My mom told me
that I should tell the truth,

29:25.514 --> 29:29.155
that we don't have to be afraid
of Mr. Hawk anymore.

29:29.155 --> 29:32.935
I didn't pack the suitcase myself.
Mr. Hawk put the gun in it.

29:32.935 --> 29:35.753
He told me to leave it
at daddy's house.

29:35.753 --> 29:41.267
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I told anyone the truth,

29:41.267 --> 29:46.264
he'd take my mom away.
I'd never see her again.

29:46.264 --> 29:50.162
So Hawk shoots the Judge's wife,
frames Clay,

29:50.162 --> 29:52.307
which he thinks so went him Christine.

29:52.307 --> 29:55.973
Then she balks, so he threatens
to frame her.

29:55.973 --> 30:00.987
And after all this, he still thinks
she'll run away with him to the Maldives?

30:00.987 --> 30:04.247
- That's her story.
- Okay, go back to Mr. Hawk.

30:04.247 --> 30:08.666
Let him know his vacation plans are
changing and bring along a no-knock warrant.

30:08.666 --> 30:09.857
A no-knock?

30:09.857 --> 30:11.996
My door's always open to you guys.

30:11.996 --> 30:13.926
I got permits.

30:15.107 --> 30:18.464
Christine told us about your
secret room behind the bookcase.

30:18.464 --> 30:20.545
She wouldn't do that.

30:22.049 --> 30:25.958
You wanna tell me the code, or
should we just bust the whole thing down?

30:27.597 --> 30:30.575
26, 4, 3.

30:55.548 --> 31:00.480
Wow. Some secret room.

31:04.531 --> 31:07.580
Brass core KTW bullets.

31:07.580 --> 31:11.247
The same bullet that killed Monica Frye.

31:12.686 --> 31:17.145
You know, Christine fingered you
as the shooter, Hawk.

31:17.145 --> 31:20.250
Said it was your idea to frame Clay.

31:20.250 --> 31:21.952
She put the whole rap on you.

31:21.952 --> 31:23.566
She wouldn't do that.
Not to me.

31:23.566 --> 31:27.451
Hawk, she already did it.

31:28.570 --> 31:34.486
Look, what if you had a client that was
looking at a trumped-up murder charge?

31:34.486 --> 31:38.898
But he said his beautiful mistress
wouldn't do that to him?

31:38.898 --> 31:41.342
What would your gut say?

31:45.922 --> 31:50.109
All right, I lied to you before.
I'm sorry.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.641
I did tell Christine that
the Judge was switching sides.

31:52.641 --> 31:54.333
How'd she react?

31:54.333 --> 31:55.889
She flipped out.

31:55.889 --> 31:57.843
She stole one of my guns
a few hours later.

31:57.843 --> 31:59.712
Where were you during all this?

31:59.712 --> 32:02.853
I'm 50 years old.
I fell asleep.

32:02.853 --> 32:05.552
After you had sex with her?

32:05.552 --> 32:08.462
So she broke into your safe room?

32:09.144 --> 32:11.285
I woke up.

32:11.811 --> 32:16.102
It was midnight.
She had stolen one of my guns.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.289
She said that we had to plant it
in Clay's house.

32:19.289 --> 32:22.228
Why didn't you go to the police?

32:24.719 --> 32:27.967
Did you ever see "Carolina Heat," detective?

32:29.183 --> 32:32.328
Christine Mayfield's first film.

32:32.328 --> 32:37.017
She was 22...
and wearing a wet T-shirt.

32:37.017 --> 32:39.976
I mean, look at her.
Look at me.

32:39.976 --> 32:43.307
When I was with her, I felt like
I was starring in my own movie.

32:43.307 --> 32:46.256
That's very romantic.
Do you have any proof?

32:46.256 --> 32:49.765
Anything.
Maybe her sweater.

32:52.639 --> 32:56.076
I had her sweater and her shoes.

32:56.076 --> 32:59.564
And I burned them to protect her.

33:00.363 --> 33:02.640
Richie.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.254
She was telling me how easy
it would be to play Clay.

33:07.254 --> 33:10.249
The whole time she was playing me.

33:13.299 --> 33:17.097
All right, Clay Darren really was framed.
Agreed?

33:17.097 --> 33:18.923
Who ran the frame?

33:18.923 --> 33:20.689
They both did.

33:21.384 --> 33:23.134
Hawk led us to Christine.

33:23.134 --> 33:26.573
She played us the phone message.
He planted the gun.

33:26.573 --> 33:28.270
And who shot the Judge's wife?

33:28.270 --> 33:29.903
Each one blames the other.

33:29.903 --> 33:32.709
Casting reasonable doubt.
Also part of their plan?

33:32.709 --> 33:33.880
Could be.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.008
Except Christine has hedged her bets.

33:36.008 --> 33:38.449
She's got Clay on her side
two against one.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.579
Three against one.
There's the boy's testimony.

33:40.579 --> 33:43.662
He said he was afraid of Hawk.
Kid was crying.

33:44.970 --> 33:47.294
Just like the mother.

33:48.758 --> 33:54.491
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I told anyone the truth...

33:54.491 --> 33:57.698
Hold it. Now watch Christine
in Carolina Heat.

33:57.698 --> 34:00.162
My Billy Bob's not a killer.

34:00.162 --> 34:03.962
He was trying to protect me.
I swear.

34:05.477 --> 34:08.163
Kid's acting.
If you can call it that.

34:08.163 --> 34:11.340
Christine coached her son
to help frame Hawk.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.920
She switched sides.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.869
First she used Hawk to set up Clay.

34:14.869 --> 34:17.687
Now she's playing Clay
to set up Hawk.

34:17.687 --> 34:20.813
Logan got Hawk to see the truth.

34:20.813 --> 34:22.534
But Clay's a director.

34:22.534 --> 34:27.443
In order for him to see it,
he'll have to think it's his idea.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.946
If Hawk has confessed,
I don't understand why you need us.

34:31.946 --> 34:35.178
Inconsistencies in his story.
We're hoping you can clear them up.

34:35.178 --> 34:37.745
Christine, we've gotta get
this animal off the street.

34:37.745 --> 34:41.844
I know you're spooked, honey.
But the detectives can protect you.

34:42.071 --> 34:46.001
There's nothing to worry about.
You'll be behind one-way glass.

34:48.907 --> 34:52.172
The claustrophobia in here.
It's visceral.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.349
Clay, please.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.256
Captain Ross is taking
his statement now.

34:57.256 --> 35:03.104
So, Judge Frye, you admit
you bribed him to side with Christine?

35:03.104 --> 35:05.249
Bribe is a strong word.

35:05.249 --> 35:07.176
Convinced.

35:07.176 --> 35:09.093
Clay, I had no idea he did that.

35:09.093 --> 35:11.592
I knew that SOB was on the take.

35:11.592 --> 35:14.316
Nothing to do with you.
I know.

35:14.316 --> 35:17.711
And then the Judge told you
he'd have to reverse himself.

35:17.711 --> 35:20.455
Evidently Clay had intimidated him.

35:20.455 --> 35:22.847
How did your client Christine
Mayfield react to that?

35:22.847 --> 35:24.280
She was distraught.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.153
Distraught? No.

35:26.153 --> 35:27.662
Unaware.

35:27.662 --> 35:30.920
See, that's one of the inconsistencies
we're talking about.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.221
Right.

35:32.221 --> 35:33.553
What happened next?

35:33.553 --> 35:37.632
I tried to comfort Christine.

35:37.632 --> 35:40.703
We had sex.
And then I fell asleep.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.616
- I told you he had delusions.
- You told me, honey.

35:43.616 --> 35:48.301
Christine, she, uh, knew just
what to do to put me out.

35:48.301 --> 35:50.389
Meaning...?

35:51.298 --> 35:53.138
A little move.

35:53.138 --> 35:56.021
Reminded me of a cat.

35:56.021 --> 35:57.599
The cat thing?

35:57.599 --> 36:00.006
- Our cat thing?
- Clay, he's lying.

36:00.006 --> 36:02.478
What happened next, Mr. Hawk?

36:02.478 --> 36:04.686
I woke up a few hours later.

36:04.686 --> 36:07.267
Christine's back on top of me sobbing.

36:07.267 --> 36:11.629
Says she stole one of my guns
and took a shot at the Judge's house.

36:11.629 --> 36:13.267
He's pathological.

36:13.267 --> 36:15.003
You were sleeping with this Yutz.

36:15.003 --> 36:18.644
- You're saying she snapped?
- That's what I thought at first.

36:18.644 --> 36:23.155
But then Christine started
to brag how she could frame Clay.

36:23.365 --> 36:28.045
She sent a call girl to pick him up,
pretend she was a fan,

36:28.045 --> 36:30.540
tie him up for the evening
without an alibi.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.037
We don't have to listen to this.
Let's go...

36:32.037 --> 36:33.580
No, no, no, no, no.

36:33.580 --> 36:36.091
You sent a call girl?
When?

36:36.091 --> 36:39.436
Your original alibi,
Tracey, the Cinephile?

36:39.436 --> 36:40.988
Just... let's just go.

36:40.988 --> 36:44.835
We checked around at your restaurant.
Turns out she works out-call.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.487
No. No way.
No way.

36:47.487 --> 36:50.563
That girl really understood
my work as an artist. She knew...

36:50.563 --> 36:52.426
Let me guess.

36:52.426 --> 36:55.036
Just your type, right?

36:56.309 --> 37:00.292
Yeah. Exactly.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.920
You paid her to do me?

37:03.920 --> 37:06.308
What? You actually think
she liked "Us, Again"?

37:06.308 --> 37:07.881
She wasn't even born
when it came out.

37:07.881 --> 37:10.829
She probably coached her
just like she coached your son.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.548
Look, Clay.
Don't listen to any of this.

37:13.548 --> 37:15.508
We are gonna be fine... / Wait...
wait a minute. What do you mean?

37:15.508 --> 37:17.362
She coached my boy?

37:17.362 --> 37:20.791
Yeah, you know,
how to create hose fake tears.

37:20.791 --> 37:23.646
You recognize this move?

37:25.200 --> 37:28.955
My cheap acting trick.
You used it in Carolina Heat.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.293
You taught it to me, you hack!

37:30.293 --> 37:32.093
How could you drag CJ into this?

37:32.093 --> 37:35.361
- He loves his mommy.
- She was using your son.

37:35.361 --> 37:39.210
It was easy.
He'll do anything to please me.

37:39.732 --> 37:42.974
Just like every man
in your life, Christine?

37:42.974 --> 37:46.933
Yeah, actually.
You know how it is.

37:47.209 --> 37:49.779
They all look at me, hungry.

37:49.779 --> 37:52.456
Give me, give me a look.

37:52.456 --> 37:55.294
A smile, a little sugar.

37:55.294 --> 37:57.139
I'm curious, Clay,

37:57.139 --> 37:59.341
what did she tell you
when she visited you at Rikers?

37:59.341 --> 38:02.537
- Don't listen to him, Clay.
- I don't... I don't...

38:02.537 --> 38:04.495
She told me...

38:04.910 --> 38:07.190
She... she....
She...

38:07.190 --> 38:10.927
She told me to say that I was
with her the night of the murder.

38:10.927 --> 38:12.757
That she was giving me an alibi.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.214
No, she was giving herself an alibi.

38:15.214 --> 38:16.744
Christine, how could you...

38:16.744 --> 38:19.186
You did this.
All of it.

38:19.186 --> 38:21.942
- You're such a selfish bitch.
- You mean survivor.

38:21.942 --> 38:24.703
What was I supposed to do?
Count on you?

38:24.703 --> 38:28.628
- Easy. Clay.
- No.

38:28.628 --> 38:33.106
My loving husband screwing every
wannabe starlet that crossed his path.

38:33.106 --> 38:34.342
I always loved you.

38:34.342 --> 38:35.522
So what?
Get in line.

38:35.522 --> 38:38.518
Hawk with his stinking cigar breath,
Judge Frye fawning all over me!

38:38.518 --> 38:41.144
So you were doing the Judge.
I knew it.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.977
I bought him a few steak dinners.

38:42.977 --> 38:44.556
Let him cop a feel in the booth.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.875
Then he had the nerve to tell me
that he was in love with his wife.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.731
His wife?

38:49.731 --> 38:52.362
It was you.
You shot her.

38:53.753 --> 38:55.245
Frye was gonna rule against me

38:55.245 --> 38:58.301
after I let him think that he was someone
that I would lower myself to sleep with.

38:58.301 --> 39:00.492
I only wished I would
have shot him instead.

39:00.492 --> 39:03.140
You told me that Hawk was the killer.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.942
And you believed me, you idiot?

39:04.942 --> 39:06.998
You lied to me.

39:06.998 --> 39:10.192
And you made Clay Jr., lie too.

39:10.429 --> 39:12.483
- He's just a boy.
- Don't kid yourself.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.041
An innocent.
Like you were when we met.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.036
If you ever thought
that I was innocent,

39:17.036 --> 39:18.829
then you never knew me at all.

39:18.829 --> 39:21.070
- Good-bye for the last time, Clay.
- Not so fast,

39:21.070 --> 39:23.796
Christine Mayfield, you're under arrest
for the murder of Monica Frye...

39:23.796 --> 39:27.464
- I don't understand.
- That's it. It's over.

39:27.464 --> 39:29.410
It's not over.

39:29.410 --> 39:32.003
Clay can't testify against me.
We're still married.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.779
He can if he wants to.

39:36.766 --> 39:39.422
Clay, I love you.

39:48.171 --> 39:50.363
Where's the DA?

39:52.841 --> 39:54.733
This way.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.462
Come on.

39:58.207 --> 40:01.322
He'll come crawling back.
He always does.

40:01.322 --> 40:03.304
You'll see.

40:04.782 --> 40:07.266
Judge Frye has agreed
to early retirement.

40:07.266 --> 40:10.290
Hawk and Clay are with the DA
playing let's-make-a-deal.

40:10.290 --> 40:13.513
They'll both testify against Christine.

40:13.513 --> 40:15.576
Nice work, you two.

40:15.835 --> 40:18.669
Hey. Let's grab a beer.

40:19.959 --> 40:23.017
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
You gotta get back to your husband.

40:23.017 --> 40:24.922
And kids.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.911
Maybe another time.
Good night.

40:28.291 --> 40:30.719
Good night, Falacci.
