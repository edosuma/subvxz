00:01.959 --> 00:04.542
(J.D.)<i> It felt good to be holding</i>
<i>the mother of my child.</i>

00:04.625 --> 00:06.041
This is nice.

00:06.125 --> 00:07.458
(J.D.) <i>But given recent events,</i>

00:07.542 --> 00:09.750
<i>cuddling was as far</i>
<i>as I was gonna go.</i>

00:09.834 --> 00:12.000
<i>Kim and I had to get</i>
<i>to know each other again</i>

00:12.083 --> 00:15.667
<i>and build trust, and--oh, my God,</i>
<i>is that side boob?</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:17.875
Whoa, careful with
the side boob, big guy.

00:17.959 --> 00:21.250
My hormones are going crazy.
I might just pounce your skinny ass.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.917
Kim, I really don't think we should.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.917
I won't. (sniffs) I got a giant
boogie in my nose.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.667
(J.D.)<i> Look at her saying, "I won't"</i>
<i>with a giant boogie in her nose.</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:31.917
<i>I must have her!</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:34.083
-You know what, on second thought--
-Yes?

00:34.166 --> 00:35.417
(J.D.)<i> Still, I wonder</i>
<i>what it'll be like</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:37.000
<i>having sex with a pregnant woman.</i>

00:37.959 --> 00:40.625
<i>That was so cool... and weird.</i>

00:40.709 --> 00:43.041
Yeah, somebody else liked it, too.

00:43.125 --> 00:46.375
-He's going crazy in there.
-And now it's disgusting.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.625
(J.D.)<i> The next 3 weeks flew by.</i>

00:50.375 --> 00:52.041
<i>We stayed up nights talking.</i>

00:54.041 --> 00:56.041
<i>We got the place ready for a baby.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:02.291
<i>And before you knew it,</i>
<i>we were a couple again.</i>

01:02.375 --> 01:03.375
Bye.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.709
Bye, Sammy.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.709
(J.D.) <i>Now that Elliot's wedding</i>
<i>was only a week away,</i>

01:11.792 --> 01:13.041
<i>things were getting tense.</i>

01:13.125 --> 01:14.458
I just don't understand
why our families

01:14.542 --> 01:15.792
can't sit at the same table.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.709
Keith, it's impossible to fit all
the Dudemeisters

01:17.792 --> 01:20.375
at one table without our wedding
looking like Oktoberfest.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.959
Plus, when our families
met last month,

01:22.041 --> 01:24.250
my mom ended up doinking your uncle
Ronald in our basement.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.750
Uncle Ronald and aunt Alicia
have been together for 30 years!

01:26.834 --> 01:28.291
Yeah, welcome to my family, Keith.

01:28.917 --> 01:32.083
Look... (sighs)
I know that I'm being a bridezilla,

01:32.166 --> 01:34.750
so to make it up to you,
here's a kiss with extra tongue.

01:35.959 --> 01:40.125
(moaning)

01:42.208 --> 01:44.542
Ok, now go try on that tux
that I picked out for you.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Chop chop! Quick like a bunny!

01:47.667 --> 01:48.667
Hey, and you!

01:48.750 --> 01:50.709
You're the only one that hasn't
RSVPed to my wedding yet.

01:50.792 --> 01:52.959
-What the hell?
-I didn't know I was invited.

01:53.041 --> 01:55.041
But I sent your invitation to...

01:56.000 --> 01:58.083
One north cemetery drive.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.208
That's the address
of the Addams family.

02:00.291 --> 02:01.959
-Oh.
-I changed my records

02:02.041 --> 02:04.041
to mess with Kelso,
'cause he's always calling me lurch.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.583
It was either that or
1313 Mockingbird Lane.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.542
<i>The Munsters? </i>TV show? I'm old.

02:11.792 --> 02:12.792
So can you make it?

02:12.875 --> 02:15.208
Are you crazy?
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.583
-Thank you!
-Not a big hugger, but...

02:19.250 --> 02:20.917
-There we go.
-There it is.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.834
(J.D.) <i>Things weren't</i>
<i>as heartwarming everywhere.</i>

02:22.917 --> 02:24.917
<i>Dr. Cox wasn't exactly super-psyched</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:26.834
<i>about me being</i>
<i>his daughter's godfather.</i>

02:26.917 --> 02:29.250
Jordan, here's some things
I'd rather see happen

02:29.333 --> 02:32.041
than dinkus over there
becoming the godfather.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.875
A nuclear war,
a sequel to <i>Hope Floats,</i>

02:34.959 --> 02:36.625
Hugh Jackman winning an Oscar--

02:36.709 --> 02:39.458
Yeah, yeah, funny, long list.
We get it.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.709
You need a new thing, big guy.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.917
-Oh...
-Sweetie!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.041
Why would I get rid of him
as godfather

02:46.125 --> 02:48.792
when you keep letting me know
how much it bothers you?

02:48.875 --> 02:50.792
-It's like he's never met you.
-Right?

02:50.875 --> 02:52.208
And I love <i>Hope Floats.</i>

02:52.917 --> 02:55.709
Anyone that's going
to the christening--

02:55.792 --> 02:57.125
not you.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.542
It's at the hospital chapel.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.083
(J.D.)<i> And then Jordan pushed</i>
<i>Dr. Cox over the edge</i>

03:04.166 --> 03:07.250
<i>by calling their daughter,</i>
<i>little Jennifer Dylan, this.</i>

03:07.333 --> 03:08.959
Ok, come on, J.D.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.875
-Dr. Cox--
-Leave.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.458
Yes.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.083
That goes for everyone.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.041
All living things.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.875
(J.D.)<i> This might not blow over.</i>

03:33.208 --> 03:35.291
Ooh, I gotta hurt someone.

03:35.375 --> 03:38.208
(J.D.)<i> It's amazing</i>
<i>how some couples are so close</i>

03:38.291 --> 03:40.125
<i>that they can</i>
<i>finish each other sentences.</i>

03:40.208 --> 03:43.875
So there we were,
hottest day of the year...

03:43.959 --> 03:47.875
At the beach and we're both wearing
jeans! Isn't that crazy?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.792
-Guess who we run into--
-Also in jeans.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.875
It was Dr. J, Kim!

03:52.959 --> 03:55.125
And unless you want to hear about
this for the next hour,

03:55.208 --> 03:57.041
please change the subject.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.458
Ok, uh...

03:58.875 --> 04:01.291
my lease is up on my apartment
in Washington,

04:01.375 --> 04:05.125
and, uh, my O.B. said that my mucus
plug is holding firm.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.250
And that's, uh, all I've got.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.375
Ugh. Why don't you just
give up that apartment?

04:09.458 --> 04:11.000
You said it's so small.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.083
Plus, I think it'd be fun

04:12.166 --> 04:13.709
if the baby was around here
for a few months.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.625
Ok, I'll give it up.

04:15.959 --> 04:17.792
Incidentally, that's not the first
time she's said that today,

04:17.875 --> 04:19.375
if you know what I'm talking about.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.291
-I know what you're talking about.
-I hit it, and I hit it good.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.625
-Yes, you did.
-Rowdy style.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.709
We have to look out for that belly,
it's dangerous!

04:25.792 --> 04:27.041
Listen, I have a video

04:27.125 --> 04:29.208
that you might be a little
interested in watching.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.792
-Are you sure?
-Welcome to my world.

04:33.709 --> 04:37.125
♪<i> I can't do this</i>
<i>All on my own </i>♪

04:37.208 --> 04:38.792
♪ <i>No, I know </i>♪

04:38.875 --> 04:40.375
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:43.959 --> 04:45.583
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:48.834 --> 04:51.250
Babe, I like this tuxedo more than
the one you picked out.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.834
Yeah, it looks really great, Keith.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.917
You know, if you plan on sawing me
in half at the altar

04:56.000 --> 04:57.208
and yelling "abracadabra!"

04:57.291 --> 04:58.834
But it's comfortable.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.208
You think that I'm gonna be
comfortable in my 5-inch heels

05:01.291 --> 05:03.083
and my rib-crushing corset
and my nipple tape?

05:03.917 --> 05:06.500
There will be no poppers
in my wedding photos, Keith.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.750
Look, you have to remember
this is probably the only time

05:09.834 --> 05:11.500
that all of our closest friends
and our family

05:11.583 --> 05:13.333
are going to be all together
in the same room.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.417
So this wedding really isn't
about us, ok?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.333
-Ok.
-It's about me!

05:18.417 --> 05:21.750
Now come on, focus!
There's no you in wedding, huh?

05:24.125 --> 05:26.792
This is Mr. Cole. He's in a
persistent vegetative state

05:26.875 --> 05:28.959
and was admitted with
community-acquired pneumonia.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.875
It's most likely related
to aspiration,

05:30.959 --> 05:33.208
given his prior phrenic
nerve paralysis.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.041
His doctor's creepy.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.834
-That's his wife.
-Right, right.

05:39.709 --> 05:41.458
Men, I've gathered the brain trust

05:41.542 --> 05:44.959
because I have been invited
to blond doctor's wedding.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.208
Now, none of you guys
should feel bad

05:47.291 --> 05:49.625
because you weren't invited, it
doesn't mean she doesn't like you.

05:49.709 --> 05:52.917
It just means that you're not
one of her favorite 385 people.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.458
-I couldn't make it anyway.
-They gotta have cut off somewhere.

05:55.542 --> 05:59.250
Now, what I need from you
is gift ideas. Impress me.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.000
You could check their registry
and get her some nice linens.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.667
Or I could check the boring
and get her some boring boring.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.333
What the hell does that mean?

06:07.417 --> 06:11.166
Oh! You know what I got my mom
that she really loved?

06:11.250 --> 06:17.250
That weird birth control thing
that they sew under your arm skin!

06:17.333 --> 06:20.208
Ok, highly disturbing,
but you're thinking outside the box.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.750
Oh, yeah.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.500
What's goin' on, guys?

06:23.583 --> 06:26.625
I didn't get beeped on my special
brain trust pager.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.542
This is awkward. Look, uh, Doug,

06:28.625 --> 06:30.959
I'm only comfortable
with a 3-man brain trust,

06:31.041 --> 06:33.417
and right now,
I'm giving Lloyd here a tryout.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.208
I'm gonna have
to ask for the pager back.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.375
Thanks, kid.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.333
You can still come to the picnic.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.125
Here you go, Lloyd.
Here's your pager.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.500
Your idea?

06:45.583 --> 06:47.583
There's this amazing house
on my delivery route

06:47.667 --> 06:49.875
with all kinds of valuable stuff
and no alarm.

06:49.959 --> 06:50.959
We could rob it.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.709
I'm gonna need that back.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.417
-Hold onto this for a little while.
-Ok.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.333
So, it turns out
my hospital in Tacoma

06:58.417 --> 07:01.083
won't Grant me more than a 6-week
leave of absence.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.000
Just look for a job here.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.000
I'd love to have my kid
in the same city.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.417
Plus, Kelso hates the urologist he
hired to replace you.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.583
(Kim) <i>Are you sure?</i>

07:09.667 --> 07:12.083
Hey, I love being
the new urologist here,

07:12.166 --> 07:14.750
but I'm having some trouble
with my peers.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.834
Get it? Pee-ers?

07:17.542 --> 07:19.083
God, I hate you.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.709
I'm pretty sure.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.542
All right, I'll check it out.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.333
Rog, rerun.

07:25.417 --> 07:26.834
Ok, Tina...

07:26.917 --> 07:28.208
here's what I'm prepared
to offer you

07:28.291 --> 07:30.667
to relinquish the post of godfather.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.166
Not interested.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.417
Effective immediately, I will stop
calling you girls' names.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.583
Interested now?

07:36.667 --> 07:38.041
I'm still here, aren't I?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.417
-Be strong. You can get more.
-Good thinking.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.333
What else you got, per-per?

07:43.417 --> 07:46.166
I'll give you
my real pager number.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.000
I'll be able to page him 24/7!

07:48.083 --> 07:49.333
-No deal.
-What are you doing?!

07:49.417 --> 07:51.500
Argh!
Put a cherry on top.

07:52.375 --> 07:53.375
One hug.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.000
-(gasps)
-Per week.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.667
-Decade.
-Month.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.166
-Year.
-Done. You're welcome.

08:01.417 --> 08:04.709
(J.D.) <i>And then, as I was about</i>
<i>to close the deal of the century,</i>

08:04.792 --> 08:05.917
<i>it hit me--</i>

08:06.000 --> 08:07.834
Wait a minute, if I agree to that,

08:07.917 --> 08:09.709
I only get that stuff
until you retire.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.458
But if I'm godfather,
I'm in your life forever.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.583
I'll see you at the christening.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.000
I think this time
I'm actually going to kill him.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.875
Yep. It's the one.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.667
Babe, should the valets
at our reception

08:25.750 --> 08:27.750
wear green or red vests?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.625
Doesn't matter.
Why didn't you just pick one?

08:29.709 --> 08:31.291
Because I want every detail
of our wedding

08:31.375 --> 08:33.583
to be exactly the way you want it.

08:33.667 --> 08:37.041
I have never loved you more
than I do at this moment.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.083
And I want them to wear green.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.000
-Forest, not lime.
-Got it.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.250
How did you get him
to be like that?

08:46.834 --> 08:48.917
Did you do that thing
all guys want us to do

08:49.000 --> 08:50.083
but we swore we'd never do?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.125
I didn't have to.
He just loves me.

08:52.667 --> 08:53.667
Why, did you?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.333
I'm saving that bullet
for a diamond tennis bracelet.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.250
By the way,
Frank's breathing was labored,

09:01.333 --> 09:02.917
so I suctioned his airway.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.625
Mrs. Cole, I have to say
I am blown away

09:05.709 --> 09:07.583
by how you're taking care
of your husband.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.333
Especially after 2 years.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.250
Isn't it hard to make yourself
do it every day?

09:12.917 --> 09:13.917
No.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.125
We were married 19 years
before his accident.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.625
You're getting married.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.333
You understand that kind of love.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.959
Sorry. My husband
has a little eye-gunk.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.083
Ok, I've got something
we can't give her permanently,

09:37.166 --> 09:38.917
but I can guarantee
she'll enjoy it

09:39.000 --> 09:40.291
while she has her hands on it.

09:40.375 --> 09:43.083
No! Preemptive strike
on the sex joke.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.208
Take a time-out.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.709
What about a nice tour
in the wine country?

09:48.792 --> 09:51.125
Come on, Doug, now you're just
embarrassing yourself.

09:51.208 --> 09:55.500
-I still don't know what I did.
-You're old news, bro. Just go.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.000
Ok, maybe I didn't make myself
clear.

10:00.083 --> 10:03.208
I don't want to give blond doctor
just a thing, you know?

10:03.291 --> 10:05.291
I wanted her married life
to be full of joy.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.792
I want to give her happiness.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.291
Well, that's not really up to us.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.542
It's up to him.

10:12.709 --> 10:17.250
We can't control
what kind of husband he'll be.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.166
Lloyd, give me those glasses.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.750
Say that again.
Exactly the same way.

10:22.834 --> 10:27.875
We can't control
what kind of husband he'll be.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.458
Or can we?

10:31.458 --> 10:32.625
Dorian.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.792
Tell your baby mama
she can have her job back.

10:36.333 --> 10:40.083
By the way, I think it's hilarious
that you trust her again.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.917
I know, sir. I got your email.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.291
Well, I'm off to my thinking spot

10:45.375 --> 10:48.375
to put the finishing touches
on my goddad speech.

10:48.458 --> 10:52.208
A word of advice,
bring your hankies.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.083
You can't do this to me.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.000
Perry, I didn't do this to torture
you.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.750
I asked Nancy no-chin
to be the godfather

11:00.834 --> 11:03.625
because I know deep down
you really care about him.

11:03.709 --> 11:05.709
And you know that he would be

11:05.792 --> 11:08.333
an excellent godfather
for our little girl.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.291
-I'll do anything.
-Here's what I want.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.041
When I buy matching outfits
for you and Jack,

11:12.125 --> 11:15.458
you have to wear them.
And I get to go on one movie date

11:15.542 --> 11:17.667
with the maitre d' at that new
Italian restaurant we go to.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.542
And no asking what happened
after I go.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.208
-Done. May I go now?
-Yeah.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.917
(J.D.)<i> Let's see,</i>
<i>what rhymes with baptism?</i>

11:26.291 --> 11:29.792
<i>Faptism, raptism, naptism.</i>

11:29.875 --> 11:31.792
<i>I'm so tired</i>
<i>I could use a naptism.</i>

11:31.875 --> 11:34.625
(chuckles)
<i>And there's my opening joke.</i>

11:34.709 --> 11:38.041
<i>I should write down "pause for</i>
<i>laugh," so I don't forget to.</i>

11:38.667 --> 11:40.917
You! You're out as godfather!

11:41.667 --> 11:43.667
How did he find my thinking spot?

11:45.625 --> 11:48.458
I can't believe who they picked
to be the new godfather.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.333
Look at him over there,
all smug and cocky.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.959
-Doody!
-Doody to you, sir.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.000
Is that blood on your scrubs?

12:00.083 --> 12:01.583
Yeah, I just got out
of surgery.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.750
What, you gonna get all up
in Jesus' face

12:03.834 --> 12:05.333
'cause he don't have his shirt on?

12:05.417 --> 12:06.458
Perry.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.417
We forgot to pick out a godmother.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.166
(baby cries)

12:11.208 --> 12:12.208
Who, uh...

12:13.208 --> 12:14.792
wants to be the godmother?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.667
Put your hand down.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.875
Carla. Do the honors?

12:19.583 --> 12:20.583
Yes!

12:20.667 --> 12:22.250
-Oh, that's bull--
-Shh!

12:22.792 --> 12:24.333
-Rabbi.
-Father.

12:24.417 --> 12:25.583
Don't care. Hit it.

12:25.667 --> 12:29.166
When we think of baptism,
we think of commitment,

12:29.250 --> 12:33.125
for when a couple decides to bring
a child into the world

12:33.208 --> 12:34.667
or share their lives together...

12:34.750 --> 12:37.333
(J.D.) <i>It's amazing</i>
<i>how quickly panic can set in.</i>

12:37.417 --> 12:40.166
<i>Like panic over whether or not</i>
<i>you love your fiancé enough.</i>

12:40.250 --> 12:43.000
I've got some gunk in my eye.
Can you get it out for me?

12:43.417 --> 12:44.417
Um...

12:44.500 --> 12:47.542
<i>Or panic over suddenly</i>
<i>finding yourself in too deep.</i>

12:47.625 --> 12:48.709
(Kim) Look at them.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.625
Mom, dad, and baby.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.542
That's gonna be us.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.750
Look, Jen,
if you need any legal help

13:02.834 --> 13:04.875
concerning your accident,
you could talk to Jim,

13:04.959 --> 13:07.709
who's a very successful,
esteemed bulldog of a lawyer,

13:07.792 --> 13:09.333
or you can talk to Ted,

13:09.417 --> 13:11.083
who, well...

13:11.166 --> 13:13.333
My mom calls me thunder.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.083
I'll go with the less shiny one.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.667
Tough break, thunder.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.375
You're not my mom, Jim!
You're not my mom!

13:22.542 --> 13:25.959
Ok, l-- sorry, Kim. I know I said
I'd come straight home,

13:26.041 --> 13:27.792
but I got stuck covering a shift.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
Well, no problem.
I'll wait up for you.

13:29.625 --> 13:30.792
And you know
that half glass wine

13:30.875 --> 13:32.291
the doctor says
I'm allowed every night?

13:32.792 --> 13:34.917
I'm going hold off
until you get here...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.500
'cause it makes me super-randy.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.667
Can't wait.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.375
(J.D.)<i> I really didn't</i>
<i>have to cover a shift,</i>

13:40.458 --> 13:42.208
<i>I just needed some time alone.</i>

13:44.417 --> 13:45.583
Hey.

13:45.667 --> 13:46.875
What are you doing here?

13:46.959 --> 13:49.542
Hiding from my significant other
due to a massive panic attack

13:49.625 --> 13:51.625
over the life-altering commitment
I'm about to make.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.000
-You?
-Same.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.458
I told Keith that I was working
tonight. He already went home.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.208
Night.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.208
Actually,
your night's just begun.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.709
I'm getting married in a week.
A week!

14:09.792 --> 14:12.041
I mean, what was I thinking,
being engaged for 2 months?

14:12.125 --> 14:13.625
My mom was engaged
for 3 years.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.542
She had time to soul-search,
to figure out if this was right,

14:16.625 --> 14:19.709
to sail around the world with
an insatiable Pakistani oil baron.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.125
Why was I in such a hurry?

14:21.208 --> 14:22.458
Oh, wait. I'll answer that for you.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.875
Because i'm the biggest idiot
in the whole entire world.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.083
Really, Elliot? The biggest?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.000
Because a few weeks ago,
I got back together

14:29.083 --> 14:32.083
with a woman who lied to me
about being pregnant with my child.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.792
You should also note
that even though I promised myself

14:34.875 --> 14:36.083
I was going to take it slow,

14:36.166 --> 14:38.000
I convinced her to give up her
apartment,

14:38.083 --> 14:41.375
quit her job, move in with me,
and start working here.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.041
-Why?
-I don't know!

14:43.125 --> 14:44.917
I'm just realizing right now
that I did all that.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.667
I just wish there was
a test I could take

14:46.750 --> 14:48.333
to tell me if I'm doing
the right thing.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.583
I mean, look at Turk and Carla.
They're so meant to be together.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.417
You spend one minute with them,
and you know that.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.583
They just have this
amazing give and take.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.291
Don't you love
this tennis bracelet?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.333
That was awesome.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.291
I'm going through
the same thing you are,

15:03.375 --> 15:05.291
except I'm also having a baby.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.208
So imagine your situation
multiplied by...

15:08.291 --> 15:10.333
What's a fair number?
A hundred billion?

15:10.417 --> 15:13.750
Why is it so important to you that
your freak-out is bigger than mine?

15:13.834 --> 15:16.500
I'm a story-topper, Elliot.
You know that about me.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.458
Ugh. When I was a kid, I had a
friend like that. It drove me crazy.

15:19.542 --> 15:21.792
When I was a kid,
I also had a friend like that,

15:21.875 --> 15:23.208
except he snapped
and started playing

15:23.291 --> 15:25.291
hide the peanut butter
with my dog Whiskers.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.709
You, my friend,
have just been story-topped.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.291
I will kill you.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.041
How am I supposed to handle
a relationship

15:31.125 --> 15:32.917
and a kid at the same time?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.417
I don't know. Dr. Cox and Jordan
are totally dysfunctional,

15:35.500 --> 15:36.834
but they seem to make it work.

15:36.917 --> 15:40.500
Wow! You guys look great!

15:42.166 --> 15:43.750
I'm going to get the photographer.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.041
Jordan, I hate this.

15:47.709 --> 15:50.542
Why? I would think
an arrogant ass like you

15:50.625 --> 15:52.875
would love having his very own
clone.

15:52.959 --> 15:57.291
-Up yours, Bobbo.
-Yeah, up yours, Bobbo.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.625
-Outstanding. Come.
-(Jack giggles)

16:04.208 --> 16:05.959
Ok, incredibly handsome guy.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.792
You're about to marry blond doctor.

16:07.875 --> 16:11.792
My gift to her is to train you
to be a good husband.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.792
Well, I think I'm ok.

16:13.875 --> 16:16.625
Really? Would you know what to do
if she suddenly woke up

16:16.709 --> 16:18.208
and couldn't use vowels?

16:18.291 --> 16:20.375
(laughs)
That's ridiculous.

16:20.458 --> 16:21.458
Is that what
you're going to say

16:21.542 --> 16:23.375
when she looks at you
with those big blue eyes

16:23.458 --> 16:27.208
and cries out, "lmttkbckklz!"

16:28.834 --> 16:31.500
Look, if I learned one thing
from my parents,

16:31.583 --> 16:34.000
it's this,
the key to a good marriage

16:34.083 --> 16:38.917
is keeping your emotions bottled-up
until they finally explode

16:39.000 --> 16:40.542
and you have
to lash out physically.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.959
You mean, beat each other up?

16:43.041 --> 16:44.709
I mean, beat yourself up.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.291
My mother once snapped
her own index finger

16:47.375 --> 16:49.291
because my father
was late for church.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.917
-She dented the car.
-He threw himself down the stairs.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.417
Boys, anything?

16:54.500 --> 16:58.834
Whatever you do, don't go bald.

16:58.917 --> 16:59.917
Lloyd, anything?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.959
Yeah, I'm still not sure
who Elliot is.

17:03.041 --> 17:06.041
Oh, come on!
This guy sucks!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.500
The thing that freaked me out
was watching this woman

17:12.583 --> 17:14.750
wipe eye-gunk off
her brain-dead husband.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.333
I mean, I don't think
I could spend 2 years

17:16.417 --> 17:18.583
wiping eye-gunk off
Keith's brain-dead face.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.000
Elliot, they were married
for, like, 20 years

17:21.083 --> 17:22.250
before that guy was in a coma.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.875
I'm sure once you and Keith have
that much time together,

17:24.959 --> 17:26.291
you'll feel differently.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.458
Still, maybe we're freaking out
about nothing, you know?

17:30.291 --> 17:32.041
Maybe we are with the right people.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.625
Really?

17:33.709 --> 17:35.792
I know last night
Kim and I had a moment

17:35.875 --> 17:38.417
that made me think we were perfect
for each other.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.583
Ecch.
This salad has beets.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.000
-Do you like beets?
-I hate beets.

17:44.083 --> 17:47.000
-Me, too!
-You do? We're both beet-haters.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.834
You know, people are so passionate
about beets.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.125
J.D.! J.D.!

17:52.000 --> 17:55.458
A mutual hatred of beets is not
enough to base a relationship on.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.333
I know, Elliot, but you interrupted
my flashback.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.375
After the beets conversation,

18:00.458 --> 18:04.041
I confided in Kim that I was really
scared about being a doctor

18:04.125 --> 18:05.583
and being a dad at the same time,

18:05.667 --> 18:07.208
because both of
those things require you

18:07.291 --> 18:09.125
to throw all of
your self into them.

18:09.458 --> 18:10.542
And she was amazing.

18:10.625 --> 18:14.250
She really calmed me down
and made me feel good about it.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.041
Oh.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.333
(J.D.)<i> Plus, we both</i>
<i>really hate beets.</i>

18:18.417 --> 18:20.333
You know, Keith is pretty
incredible.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.667
I've never felt this loved
in my entire life.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.083
Let's face it.-- Keith would walk
through fire for me.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.291
Yeah, I'm not walking through fire
to prove my love to Elliot.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.041
I find that a little suspect.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.834
Still, I suppose we could switch
to some role-playing.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.333
Here's the scenario.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.500
You have just come home
from work late.

18:39.583 --> 18:40.750
Blond doctor made your dinner

18:40.834 --> 18:42.667
and she is angry
because you didn't call ahead.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.083
Plus, you have brought
along with you Lance,

18:45.166 --> 18:48.000
your gay ultimate frisbee buddy.
Played by Todd.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.250
I should probably take my pants off.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.083
Wait for your cue.

18:53.417 --> 18:56.250
And, Ted,
you'll be playing blond doctor.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.834
Get into character.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.041
Ok. Falling in love with you.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.458
Long blond hair--

19:02.959 --> 19:04.709
(high voice) Talking very fast.
Talking very fast.

19:04.792 --> 19:07.542
Frick! Frick!
(normal voice) Ok, I'm ready.

19:08.959 --> 19:11.291
Good. Ok. Ready and...

19:11.792 --> 19:12.959
Action.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.625
Todd, did you hear a cue?

19:16.709 --> 19:18.458
That is it. Look.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.291
The only person I have to prove
my love to is Elliot,

19:21.375 --> 19:24.291
and I plan on doing that
every day for the rest of my life.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.667
Done here.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.417
Should we go
get him?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.000
No, you heard
what he just said.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.208
He's going to be a great husband
and you know why?

19:33.667 --> 19:34.792
'Cause we got him there.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.375
Way to go, brain trust.
Hands in.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.834
Not you, Lloyd.
You're out.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.083
I figured.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.792
1, 2, 3-- brain trust!

19:46.417 --> 19:48.083
Why are you wearing scrubs?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.959
I haven't seen in you in those
in, like, 2 years.

19:51.041 --> 19:53.041
I didn't want to get my christening
dress wrinkly.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.709
These are all I had in my locker.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.792
I like you in scrubs.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.458
Reminds me of when we used to date.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.542
(laughs)
That was a disaster.

20:03.417 --> 20:04.667
All of it?

20:04.750 --> 20:05.834
No.

20:07.959 --> 20:10.000
You ever think maybe
we're perfect for each other.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.083
We just have the same fatal flaw?

20:12.166 --> 20:14.500
You mean, that whenever we get
too close to a commitment,

20:14.583 --> 20:16.583
we totally freak out
and try to escape?

20:16.667 --> 20:18.709
That what we've been doing here
all night, right?

20:18.792 --> 20:20.792
Besides, I've thought about it,
and there's no escaping this one.

20:20.875 --> 20:23.458
The gifts are all here.
People bought plane tickets.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.458
I'm getting married.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.375
I've reached
the point of no return.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.250
You and me both.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.417
I mean...

20:32.875 --> 20:33.959
to get out of this...

20:34.917 --> 20:36.834
I'd have to do something huge.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.291
I'd have to go nuclear.

20:38.375 --> 20:45.166
(rock music playing)

20:48.917 --> 20:50.333
(J.D.)<i> So there we were.</i>

20:53.458 --> 20:54.542
<i>Together.</i>

21:05.250 --> 21:06.583
<i>But not together.</i>

21:18.250 --> 21:20.250
(sighs)

21:21.542 --> 21:23.041
<i>And as always...</i>

21:24.000 --> 21:27.083
<i>not knowing what the hell</i>
<i>we were doing.</i>

21:29.250 --> 21:30.250
Hey.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.917
Hey.
