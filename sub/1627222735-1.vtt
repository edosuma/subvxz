17:02.790 --> 17:04.090

17:04.124 --> 17:05.527
I would smash Hamlet.

Whew.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.311
Well, uh,

18:31.345 --> 18:34.181
pretty tired, mate,
I should get to bed.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.350
Um, you okay sleeping here?

18:36.383 --> 18:38.218
'Cause, you know, I can always,

18:38.251 --> 18:39.262
I can always
get outta your room,

18:39.286 --> 18:40.330
and you can take your room,
and I'll just

18:40.354 --> 18:43.357
- be in your dad's room.
- I'm comfortable here.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.358
Okay.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.860
Well, see ya later!

18:45.893 --> 18:48.896
- Have a good sleep.
- See ya.

19:31.673 --> 19:32.640
Whatcha doin' down there?

19:32.674 --> 19:34.441
Get back to bed.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.711
Don't be a pussy.

19:36.744 --> 19:38.913
"I'm afraid of the dark."

19:42.784 --> 19:45.285
Turn that damn thing off.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.587
Don't make that face.

19:46.621 --> 19:48.455
I'm gonna kick your ass, boy.

20:22.857 --> 20:25.927
I wish you could
eat this with me.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.264
Mm.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.934
Mm.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.869
You want me to take a bite?

20:36.971 --> 20:39.607
Not yet!

20:39.640 --> 20:41.642
Yo, Henry, check it!

20:41.676 --> 20:43.778
- Um, uh.
- Oh, it's a video,

20:43.811 --> 20:44.512
it's not live.

20:44.545 --> 20:46.047
I wouldn't do that to you, bro.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.515
- Here.
- Sorry.

20:47.548 --> 20:48.883
- Brought you breakfast!
- Ah.

20:48.916 --> 20:49.784
- Thank you.
- Here's some milk for you,

20:49.817 --> 20:50.985
kitten.

21:07.034 --> 21:10.037
What are you so scared of, bro?

21:10.071 --> 21:11.105
You're very secretive.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.373
You know, like,
what do you think, I'm dumb?

21:13.406 --> 21:16.443
I see you turn off the screen
every time I come in the room.

21:18.713 --> 21:19.857
Come on, aren't I your friend?

21:19.881 --> 21:20.715
You can tell me.

21:20.748 --> 21:22.315
Whatever it is,
I won't judge you.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.818
Is it, like,

21:23.851 --> 21:25.920
is it kinky stuff?

21:25.953 --> 21:28.488
Is it like s&m?

21:28.523 --> 21:31.659
- Uh...
- Butt stuff?

21:31.692 --> 21:34.327
- Is it gay porn? Is it gay porn?
- No, no, no.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.899
It's, it's,
it's nothing like that, I...

21:37.932 --> 21:39.299
Yeah?

21:42.103 --> 21:44.705
What?

21:44.739 --> 21:49.043
Promise me that you won't
ever say anything about this?

21:49.076 --> 21:50.745
Sure!

21:50.778 --> 21:52.513
- Cross your heart?
- Oi...

21:52.547 --> 21:55.382
- Fine, I cross my heart, Henry.
- I mean it!

21:55.415 --> 21:57.985
Okay, yeah, I cross my...
Seriously, Henry!

21:58.019 --> 22:00.320
I cross my fuckin' heart, bro.

22:16.871 --> 22:19.439
- These are my friends.
- What site is it?

22:19.472 --> 22:24.612
This is no site,
this is all live.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.446
Do they know?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.415
Of course not.

22:30.985 --> 22:32.452
You've hacked
into their webcams.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.864
Are you broadcasting,
you could make

22:33.888 --> 22:37.158
- so much money outta this.
- No, I would never do that.

22:37.191 --> 22:38.759
I don't wanna hurt them.

22:38.793 --> 22:41.062
I just,

22:41.095 --> 22:42.530
I like to watch them,

22:42.563 --> 22:44.464
and I like spending
time with them,

22:44.497 --> 22:46.100
and I know almost
everything about them.

22:46.133 --> 22:47.635
Can you record it?

22:47.668 --> 22:50.137
And I suppose the next
question you have for me is

22:50.171 --> 22:52.540
have I watched
any of them undress?

22:52.573 --> 22:54.642
- No.
- And having sex?

22:54.675 --> 22:55.853
- Huh? You seen them?
- No, no, no, that's,

22:55.877 --> 22:57.178
that's private.

22:57.211 --> 22:59.580
Oh, come off it, private.

22:59.614 --> 23:02.415
Sure, and the rest
of their lives aren't?

23:02.449 --> 23:05.152
It's not like that, I,

23:05.186 --> 23:06.754
I watch over them.

23:06.787 --> 23:09.957
I'm like their guardian angel.

23:09.991 --> 23:11.092
Yes, you're very moral.

23:11.125 --> 23:11.959
Where are they?

23:11.993 --> 23:12.927
Where do they live?

23:12.960 --> 23:15.596
Here in la.

23:15.630 --> 23:17.832
Oh, well, have you met 'em?

23:17.865 --> 23:19.634
No.

23:22.503 --> 23:24.639
Which one's your favorite?

23:24.672 --> 23:28.509
Oh, I don't know.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.077
Which one,

23:30.111 --> 23:32.713
which one do you
wish was here right now?

23:34.815 --> 23:38.552
Uh, well, if I had to pick,

23:38.586 --> 23:41.454
just for fun, um...

23:44.792 --> 23:46.493
Ella.

23:46.527 --> 23:48.461
Yup.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.131
- She's funny...
- Yeah.

23:50.164 --> 23:53.868
- And... sexy.
- Sexy, she's sexy.

23:53.901 --> 23:56.671
We don't really have
all that much in common,

23:56.704 --> 23:59.472
- but she's an Instagram model.
- Course she is,

23:59.507 --> 24:00.708
this is Los Angeles.

24:00.741 --> 24:01.976
- What's her handle?
- No!

24:02.009 --> 24:03.678
No, no, no,
these are my friends.

24:03.711 --> 24:04.888
I want you to leave them alone.

24:04.912 --> 24:06.479
Henry, I'm just... calm down.

24:06.514 --> 24:07.724
I'm just curious,
what's her handle?

24:07.748 --> 24:09.984
Promise, promise me

24:10.017 --> 24:11.552
you'll leave them alone.

24:11.585 --> 24:13.621
Okay, promise.

24:13.654 --> 24:17.091
- Promise!
- Yeah, Henry.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.694
Okay.

24:19.727 --> 24:21.562
I've gotta get to an interview.

24:21.595 --> 24:22.797
Okay, I'm gonna...

24:22.830 --> 24:24.532
I've got a...
The chick I met last night,

24:24.565 --> 24:25.776
her friend manages
a coffee shop,

24:25.800 --> 24:28.936
and I need to get a job
'cause I need to pay you rent.

24:28.970 --> 24:31.205
- Good luck!
- Yeah.

24:31.238 --> 24:34.108
Hey, listen, careful
with this shit, all right?

24:34.141 --> 24:35.943
You know what they say,

24:35.977 --> 24:38.579
if you look into
the abyss for too long,

24:38.612 --> 24:41.515
it starts to stare back.

24:41.549 --> 24:42.726
Shit, that's good, let me just,

24:42.750 --> 24:45.820
let me just get that one more.

24:45.853 --> 24:48.656
Look into the abyss
for too long,

24:48.689 --> 24:50.891
it starts to stare back.

24:53.594 --> 24:54.228
Boom!

24:54.261 --> 24:55.196
Give me five.

24:55.229 --> 24:56.530
- Killed it.
- Cool.

24:56.564 --> 24:59.066
Boom! Yeah!

24:59.100 --> 25:01.302
See ya, see ya later, buddy.

26:12.039 --> 26:15.042
Can you unbutton your blouse?

26:15.076 --> 26:19.113
I, I can't model nude.

26:19.146 --> 26:23.050
This is a very special wine.

26:23.084 --> 26:24.685
Where's it from?

26:26.253 --> 26:29.256
A girl friend of mine
gets it from France.

26:33.127 --> 26:35.129
I'm sure you will enjoy it.

26:39.333 --> 26:42.636
Come over here, Lia.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.939
It's Laura.

26:44.972 --> 26:46.774
Whatever.

26:48.876 --> 26:52.046
- Take it off.
- Oh, well, not here.

26:52.079 --> 26:54.048
Let's go to my bedroom.

27:50.371 --> 27:51.972
Shit!

27:55.476 --> 27:57.745
Uh...

28:05.886 --> 28:09.456
What are you doing?

28:09.490 --> 28:11.759
I'm so sorry, mate.
I just, I saw the light on,

28:11.792 --> 28:13.327
I wanted to come
say hello to you.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.238
And then you weren't here,
and so I just wanted to see

28:15.262 --> 28:19.133
what the chicks were doing.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.166
I'm sorry.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.307
It won't happen again.

30:07.007 --> 30:08.475
Eric?

30:10.311 --> 30:14.014
- Dad?
- Where the fuck were you, huh?

30:14.048 --> 30:15.258
You know you're not
allowed to leave the house

30:15.282 --> 30:16.950
without permission!

30:16.984 --> 30:18.118
Huh?

30:37.971 --> 30:40.642
Hi.

30:40.675 --> 30:44.546
Mom, no, I don't watch CNN.

30:46.380 --> 30:47.281
I told you,

30:47.314 --> 30:50.317
I babysit,
and I'm working on my novel.

30:53.987 --> 30:57.157
Yes, I do both.

31:02.029 --> 31:04.431
Please stop, mother.

31:06.534 --> 31:09.236
What do you think I am,
a prostitute?

31:09.269 --> 31:13.440
I haven't even had sex
in six months!

31:17.478 --> 31:19.046
Thanks.

31:20.715 --> 31:22.149
I love you too.

31:22.182 --> 31:25.219
She just cares about you, Tessa.

31:28.122 --> 31:31.024
I have, uh, my new apartment

31:31.058 --> 31:33.595
that I move into next month,

31:33.628 --> 31:36.363
and I was just thinking

31:36.397 --> 31:39.333
I could crash here
for like a couple days?

31:43.170 --> 31:45.607
Yeah.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.642
Of course.

32:07.995 --> 32:09.963
Where are you, Laura?

32:43.765 --> 32:46.033
You have such a delicious wine!

32:46.066 --> 32:47.602
Oh, that's the least I could do.

32:47.635 --> 32:50.070
Thanks for inviting me here.

32:50.103 --> 32:52.105
This is good!

32:52.139 --> 32:55.075
Is this seriously the first
time you've cooked it?

32:55.108 --> 32:57.311
It's the first time
I've cooked the whole head.

32:57.344 --> 32:59.747
Oh, my god, that's my girl!

32:59.781 --> 33:03.050
- Hello, anyone home?
- Hello, welcome!

33:03.083 --> 33:05.520
- So nice to see you.
- Good seeing you.

33:05.553 --> 33:07.689
Even more exotic.

33:07.722 --> 33:12.025
Okay, I think
everything is ready now.

33:12.059 --> 33:13.460
It's very exciting!

33:13.494 --> 33:16.764
Oh, yes, it is,
just wait for it.

33:16.798 --> 33:18.733
Okay, hon, I think it's ready.

33:18.766 --> 33:21.769
Oh, my goodness!

33:21.803 --> 33:23.605
What's in this stew?

33:27.542 --> 33:28.408
What is it?

33:28.442 --> 33:30.678
This is Kale pache.

33:30.712 --> 33:34.448
It's Mina's recipe
with my special touch.

33:34.481 --> 33:37.752
- Okay, who's first?
- Please!

33:37.785 --> 33:42.289
My favorite part is actually
the muscle behind the eye.

33:42.322 --> 33:44.057
I tried this dish
for the first time

33:44.091 --> 33:46.694
with one of my ex-boyfriends.

33:46.728 --> 33:49.062
He was an excellent cook.

33:49.096 --> 33:52.099
- Quite useless otherwise.
- I like it.

33:52.132 --> 33:54.101
How did you prepare it?

33:54.134 --> 33:57.471
Well, the real trick
is to find a head.

33:59.273 --> 34:02.810
- I have never seen such a thing.
- And add some spices to it.

34:02.844 --> 34:04.712
What is this?

34:04.746 --> 34:07.447
Just, like, out of curiosity.

34:07.481 --> 34:09.382
So, I'm picking up on the sides

34:09.416 --> 34:12.485
from the cheek.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.688
- And a little bit from the...
- Let me help.

34:16.389 --> 34:18.860
Oh, yeah, let me
have another piece!

34:18.893 --> 34:20.460
I see you have to
dig in at an angle

34:20.494 --> 34:25.098
- to get into the skull.
- Yes, it is quite eccentric.

34:28.201 --> 34:31.639
Maybe, maybe something
a little bit less,

34:31.672 --> 34:35.409
less, like, adventurous.

34:35.442 --> 34:39.279
Do you want to try the part
that's my favorite?

34:41.616 --> 34:44.719
- Okay.
- Is it, like, soft?

34:44.752 --> 34:47.187
Yes, I like it soft.

35:10.177 --> 35:12.747
Oi, there he is!

35:12.780 --> 35:13.748
What are you doing,
are you okay?

35:13.781 --> 35:14.682
- What are you doin'?
- Yeah.

35:14.716 --> 35:15.617
You all right?

35:15.650 --> 35:16.751
- Yeah.
- Hey,

35:16.784 --> 35:19.286
I got you a present
for your birthday.

35:19.319 --> 35:20.387
Oh, yeah.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.189
It's not my birthday, what, why?

35:22.222 --> 35:23.767
It doesn't matter that
it's not your birthday.

35:23.791 --> 35:25.560
We're gonna have
a fuckin' fantastic time.

35:25.593 --> 35:27.394
- Here we go.
- Wait, why? What?

35:27.427 --> 35:28.328
Don't worry about it.

35:28.362 --> 35:29.372
You're gonna be fine, here.

35:29.396 --> 35:30.497
Put some sexy music on.

35:30.531 --> 35:32.499
Go, go, go, go, go.

35:32.533 --> 35:34.368
Gotta get this outta the way.

35:34.401 --> 35:37.304
Are you, you good?

35:37.337 --> 35:39.339
- How's this?
- No, that's not sexy enough.

35:39.373 --> 35:41.643
Needs to be really sexy,
like makin' love music,

35:41.676 --> 35:45.479
baby-makin' music,
like poundin' music.

35:45.513 --> 35:48.583
- Uh, how 'bout this?
- Good, perfect!

35:48.616 --> 35:49.984
Here, now you
sit down over there.

35:50.018 --> 35:52.228
- And I'm sittin' down over here.
- What are we... what's going on?

35:52.252 --> 35:54.388
What are we doing?

35:56.524 --> 36:00.494
- Happy birthday!
- Oh!

36:00.528 --> 36:02.329
- He's cute!
- I know.

36:02.362 --> 36:04.632
You've been a bad boy.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.934
I told her your secret!

36:06.968 --> 36:08.746
That you're obsessed with her,
and you think she's sexy,

36:08.770 --> 36:11.405
and you look at her
Instagram account.

36:11.438 --> 36:14.609
- All the time.
- He's a huge fan!

36:14.642 --> 36:18.245
- I love meeting my followers.
- Oh, yeah.

36:18.278 --> 36:19.212
He's really cute.

36:19.246 --> 36:21.716
- He's so cute.
- Yeah.

36:21.749 --> 36:23.450
Look at him,
he can't believe it.

36:23.483 --> 36:24.695
You're a little devil,
aren't you?

36:24.719 --> 36:25.987
Yeah, he is.

36:27.387 --> 36:29.924
He's struggling to handle it,
he can't believe you're here!

36:29.957 --> 36:31.726
Henry?

36:31.759 --> 36:34.996
- Uh.
- Are you okay?

36:35.029 --> 36:36.798
Henry?

36:36.831 --> 36:37.941
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong with him?

36:37.965 --> 36:40.568
I have no idea,
he just needs his pills.

36:40.601 --> 36:41.945
- What the fuck?
- Here, mate, here.

36:41.969 --> 36:43.303
Take, take, take a few of these.

36:43.336 --> 36:45.006
Here, take a few of those.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.641
That's it, isn't it?

36:46.674 --> 36:47.575
He's fine.

36:47.608 --> 36:48.686
What the fuck is wrong with him?

36:48.710 --> 36:50.353
Nothing's wrong with him,
he's just excited.

36:50.377 --> 36:51.478
He's just...

36:51.512 --> 36:52.956
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
let's just go and have

36:52.980 --> 36:54.491
a couple of drinks, okay,
we'll go and have

36:54.515 --> 36:56.483
- a couple drinks.
- He's crazy.

36:56.517 --> 36:57.652
No, he's not.

36:57.685 --> 37:01.723
You just head into the room,
and I'll be right back.

37:01.756 --> 37:03.758
Have some of this,
here, have some of this.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.425
That's it, have a bit of that.

37:05.459 --> 37:09.429
Thatta boy. Thatta boy.

37:09.463 --> 37:10.397
Now breathe, breathe.

37:10.430 --> 37:12.033
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

37:12.066 --> 37:14.035
Mate, you're okay, you're okay.

37:14.068 --> 37:15.579
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- I can't breathe.

37:15.603 --> 37:17.004
You're good, you're good.

37:17.038 --> 37:19.807
- I can't breathe.
- You're good, hey.

37:19.841 --> 37:20.975
Come on, breathe.

37:21.008 --> 37:22.510
Breathe.

37:23.911 --> 37:25.580
I'm sorry, mate.

37:25.613 --> 37:27.582
I thought that
would make you happy.

37:31.418 --> 37:35.355
That's it, come here.

37:40.661 --> 37:41.629
There we go.

37:41.662 --> 37:42.964
All right, mate.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.334
Just take it easy, all right.

37:47.367 --> 37:48.712
I'm just gonna go
and check on her,

37:48.736 --> 37:50.738
just make sure she's okay,
but I'll be back.

37:50.772 --> 37:51.906
All right?

37:54.642 --> 37:55.676
There she is!

37:55.710 --> 37:57.477
Oh, look out, it's Ella!

37:58.646 --> 38:00.581
Oh, I'm gonna bite your bottom.

38:01.983 --> 38:03.450
Coming in for an attacking!

38:03.483 --> 38:04.552
Look out!

38:04.585 --> 38:05.987
Oh, god!

38:06.020 --> 38:07.688
We're having so much fun!

40:52.787 --> 40:55.523
You okay, mate?

40:55.556 --> 40:57.124
Sorry about last night, I...

40:57.158 --> 40:58.659
Uh.

41:00.828 --> 41:03.496
There's nothin'
wrong with you, mate.

41:03.531 --> 41:06.968
You just gotta learn to relax.

41:07.001 --> 41:11.572
I mean, doesn't
your medication help?

41:11.605 --> 41:13.174
Not lately.

41:13.207 --> 41:15.876
Hm, you should stop takin' it.

41:15.910 --> 41:18.179
I don't believe in that stuff
anyway, it's placebo.

41:18.212 --> 41:20.581
Pharmaceutical companies
are just a bunch of greedy pigs.

41:20.614 --> 41:21.983
They just want your money.

41:22.016 --> 41:24.218
This is California.

41:24.251 --> 41:27.288
This is the only
medication we need.

41:30.558 --> 41:31.993
We're smokin' this

41:32.026 --> 41:34.562
before I bring any
other chicks over.

41:37.965 --> 41:39.200
Hit it.

41:41.769 --> 41:45.039
Thatta boy, thatta boy.

41:45.072 --> 41:46.540
Thatta boy.

41:51.712 --> 41:54.582
I'm sorry about Ella.

41:54.615 --> 41:56.751
I know you liked her.

41:56.784 --> 41:59.220
I don't care.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.055
She's just a whore.

42:04.925 --> 42:08.963
Listen, there's something
that I have to show you, okay?

42:13.834 --> 42:17.104
Uh, I don't know
how to say this.

42:17.138 --> 42:18.973
I'll just show you.

42:21.275 --> 42:24.178
I think she's
been killing people.

42:24.211 --> 42:26.013
Look, she's dragging a body!

42:27.048 --> 42:29.083
I'm serious,
there's a body in that bag.

42:29.116 --> 42:30.851
Oh, yeah, sure.

42:30.885 --> 42:33.254
Let me show you something
that I put together.

42:33.287 --> 42:36.190
- This is from earlier.
- This is a very special wine.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.691
Okay.

42:37.725 --> 42:39.126
- Where's it from?
- No, you see,

42:39.160 --> 42:39.960
she's giving him a drink,

42:39.994 --> 42:41.862
and there's
something in that drink.

42:41.896 --> 42:43.597
She's hot.

42:43.631 --> 42:47.101
They go up to her room,
and the guy never comes out.

42:47.134 --> 42:48.736
I can tell you why.

42:48.769 --> 42:51.138
He's been juiced.

42:51.172 --> 42:54.241
Wait, let me
show you another one.

42:54.275 --> 42:55.810
Fuck.

42:55.843 --> 42:59.213
- No, this is another guy.
- Take it off.

42:59.246 --> 43:02.383
Not here,
let's go to my bedroom.

43:02.416 --> 43:06.087
- They're gonna kiss.
- Yeah, they are.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.888
- And then...
- Mm-hmm.

43:07.922 --> 43:10.391
she takes him
up to the bedroom.

43:10.424 --> 43:13.661
That's it, that's the plan.

43:13.694 --> 43:16.030
Do you want me to show you

43:16.063 --> 43:17.998
what she does with

43:18.032 --> 43:19.800
the bodies?

43:19.834 --> 43:23.737
Yes, I wanna see that, Henry.

43:23.771 --> 43:25.606
Okay.

43:29.143 --> 43:31.812
She cooks them,
and then she serves them.

43:31.846 --> 43:33.848
It's super soft, just trust me.

43:33.881 --> 43:35.950
She should try the lips,
those are...

43:35.983 --> 43:38.652
They just melt.

43:38.686 --> 43:40.354
Oh, come off!

43:40.387 --> 43:42.857
- You can't be serious!
- I am serious!

43:42.890 --> 43:45.659
I've been watching
this 24/7, and I,

43:45.693 --> 43:47.995
I, I know that, that this is,

43:48.028 --> 43:49.330
it's going on.

43:49.363 --> 43:52.900
Shh, take this.

43:55.236 --> 43:57.004
Now,

43:57.037 --> 43:59.306
tell me what we know
about the killer.

43:59.340 --> 44:02.209
Tell Sherlock all about it,
let me figure it out.

44:04.778 --> 44:06.714
She works at a bar
called Justin's...

44:06.747 --> 44:09.183
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- On sunset,

44:09.216 --> 44:13.287
and she meets the guys
through a dating app.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.756
Mm-hmm.

44:15.789 --> 44:17.925
I'm serious about this.

44:17.958 --> 44:20.928
Do you believe in
reincarnation, Henry?

44:20.961 --> 44:22.463
Yeah.

44:22.496 --> 44:25.199
I'm marlin Brando.

44:25.232 --> 44:27.434
And she's Ted Bundy.

44:27.468 --> 44:29.069
Ted Bundy in a skirt!

44:29.103 --> 44:32.740
I would let her Bundy me
seven days a week, 24 hours.

44:32.773 --> 44:34.909
Let's do it.

44:34.942 --> 44:36.977
- This is serious.
- Oh, yeah.

44:39.180 --> 44:42.216
Show me other chicks.

44:42.249 --> 44:44.118
They're all here.

44:44.151 --> 44:46.420
Don't worry, it's,
uh, it's good.

44:46.453 --> 44:48.322
- I can still, you know.
- Okay.

44:48.355 --> 44:51.258
- You're gonna come tomorrow?
- Nah, mate.

44:51.292 --> 44:54.328
You need to forget about 'em.

44:54.361 --> 44:55.963
Get out in the real world.

44:57.932 --> 45:01.302
Oh, honey, mm!

45:01.335 --> 45:06.440
The world changes when you
finally have some sex!

45:06.473 --> 45:09.443
- Mm, maybe you're right.
- Oh, I'm definitely right.

45:09.476 --> 45:10.978
If there's one thing
I know about,

45:11.011 --> 45:12.179
it's sex,

45:12.213 --> 45:15.082
sexual relations, intercourse,

45:15.115 --> 45:17.084
love-making,

45:17.117 --> 45:19.787
fuckin', you know what I mean?

45:19.820 --> 45:21.331
If there's one thing
I don't really know about,

45:21.355 --> 45:23.190
it's finding money
to pay my landlord.

45:24.825 --> 45:26.460
It's not my strong suit.

45:28.495 --> 45:29.531
Fuck your landlord.

45:29.564 --> 45:31.131
Exactly, fuck him!

45:33.100 --> 45:34.034
All right, mate.

45:34.068 --> 45:35.369
Thanks, Eric.

45:35.402 --> 45:37.137
No worries, I'll see ya.

45:39.340 --> 45:42.243
Eric, is it normal
to feel like this?

45:42.276 --> 45:44.078
- I'm really high.
- What? High, yeah.

45:44.111 --> 45:46.180
It's normal, mate.

45:46.213 --> 45:48.949
I don't know if...

45:48.983 --> 45:52.019
My arm.

45:52.052 --> 45:54.788
No, it's...

45:54.822 --> 45:56.558
We're okay.

45:58.158 --> 45:59.561
That's funny.

45:59.594 --> 46:01.262
Yeah, I love this show.

46:01.295 --> 46:02.796
Nice.

46:02.830 --> 46:05.232
How is the college, by the way?

46:05.266 --> 46:07.201
- It's going good, uh...
- Eric!

46:07.234 --> 46:08.245
I just don't know anybody.

46:08.269 --> 46:12.973
- Eric, come here!
- Oh, now you know where I live.

46:13.007 --> 46:15.142
Yeah, it's nice here.

46:15.175 --> 46:17.144
What? What's goin' on?

46:17.177 --> 46:18.345
Look.

46:18.379 --> 46:20.381
Oh, are you still
goin' on about this?

46:20.414 --> 46:21.858
She's gonna poison him,
and then she's gonna

46:21.882 --> 46:24.251
bring him up to her room.

46:24.285 --> 46:25.319
Thank you.

46:25.352 --> 46:26.396
- You're welcome.
- I'm gonna call the cops.

46:26.420 --> 46:29.156
Just wait a minute,
we don't really know yet.

46:29.189 --> 46:31.225
- It could be...
- I know we can't

46:31.258 --> 46:33.127
waste time.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.128
What are you doing?

46:34.161 --> 46:35.195
I'm texting 9-1-1.

46:35.229 --> 46:36.864
- You can text 9-1-1?
- Yeah.

46:36.897 --> 46:39.133
Oh.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.901
Would you like
anything to drink?

46:40.934 --> 46:42.504
- Yeah.
- I told you.

46:42.537 --> 46:44.371
No.

46:44.405 --> 46:47.141
I'll make you
something very special.

46:47.174 --> 46:48.942
No, whatever.

46:48.976 --> 46:51.245
No, look.

46:51.278 --> 46:53.314
- This is nonsense.
- Now, she's gonna poison him.

46:53.347 --> 46:54.048
It's nonsense!

46:54.081 --> 46:56.183
This is what she
does every time.

46:58.385 --> 47:00.187
Look, here, see?

47:02.489 --> 47:04.124
She's mixin' it in.

47:04.158 --> 47:05.392
Okay, okay.

47:05.426 --> 47:07.394
Let's just wait, wait a minute.

47:12.266 --> 47:13.901
There you go.

47:13.934 --> 47:15.936
- See?
- Hm.

47:15.969 --> 47:19.106
I told you, look.

47:19.139 --> 47:20.407
You're not gonna get any?

47:20.441 --> 47:22.610
Oh, I've already had
two cups this morning.

47:22.644 --> 47:23.944
Okay.

47:23.977 --> 47:24.945
God, don't fucking drink it,

47:24.978 --> 47:26.122
- don't fucking drink it.
- Don't drink it.

47:26.146 --> 47:29.450
You idiot, don't drink it.

47:29.483 --> 47:31.151
Oh, god, oh, god.

47:33.187 --> 47:35.189
Ah, my goodness!

47:42.463 --> 47:45.299
Drink your coffee,
it's gonna get cold.

47:45.332 --> 47:46.233
- All right.
- Oh, god,

47:46.266 --> 47:47.968
it's gonna be too late,
don't drink it.

47:51.472 --> 47:53.073
Don't drink it, mate.

47:54.542 --> 47:57.211
- It's a bit too hot for me.
- Ah, it's okay.

47:57.244 --> 47:58.312
It's okay.

47:58.345 --> 47:59.614
- Oh, god.
- It's too hot.

47:59.647 --> 48:00.615
They're not gonna
get here in time.

48:00.648 --> 48:03.350
You know, sometimes,
it's actually nice...

48:03.384 --> 48:04.652
Put it down, put it down.

48:04.686 --> 48:06.654
Did he drink it?
Did he drink it?

48:06.688 --> 48:08.389
Nope, not yet, not yet.

48:08.422 --> 48:09.591
He's seeing...

48:09.624 --> 48:11.593
Don't do it, you little shit!

48:11.626 --> 48:14.161
She's a manipulative wench.

48:18.432 --> 48:20.434
- That's them! That's them!
- Police, open up!

48:20.467 --> 48:22.403
Good, good.

48:22.436 --> 48:25.005
Keep that coffee
away from your mouth!

48:25.038 --> 48:26.473
Come on, come on, come on.

48:26.508 --> 48:27.374
Put that drink down now.

48:27.408 --> 48:29.276
Tackle her to the ground,
arrest her!

48:29.309 --> 48:29.977
Put it down.

48:30.010 --> 48:31.311
- What?
- Here we go, here we go.

48:31.345 --> 48:33.347
There they are,
I hope they find it.

48:33.380 --> 48:34.314
It's my nephew.

48:34.348 --> 48:35.249
What the hell is goin' on?

48:35.282 --> 48:36.116
What's he doin' here?

48:36.150 --> 48:37.418
Nephew, okay.

48:37.451 --> 48:39.353
Oh, I like this woman, yup, yup.

48:39.386 --> 48:40.421
- Here we go.
- Good.

48:40.454 --> 48:41.656
- They know what's up.
- Yup.

48:41.689 --> 48:43.323
I want both of you
out of here now.

48:43.357 --> 48:46.026
You get outta here!

48:46.059 --> 48:47.103
- Smell this.
- Get in the cabinet.

48:47.127 --> 48:49.396
- Get it, go to the cabinet.
- What are you doing?

48:49.430 --> 48:52.099
Found it, they've found it,
this is it.

48:52.132 --> 48:53.735
This is it, she's goin' down.

48:53.768 --> 48:55.537
She's goin' down to Chinatown.

48:57.705 --> 49:00.207
- Bam!
- Here we go.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.543
They found it.

49:02.710 --> 49:04.344
Are they gonna find it?

49:07.181 --> 49:08.726
- This is it, they'll arrest her.
- Ashwagandha.

49:08.750 --> 49:11.185
- This is it.
- Ashwa-what?

49:11.218 --> 49:13.420
- Arrest her.
- It's an Indian ginseng.

49:13.454 --> 49:15.523
- More like an Indian poison.
- Yeah.

49:15.557 --> 49:17.291
We should bring this thing
to the lab.

49:19.460 --> 49:20.460
What is she doing?

49:22.764 --> 49:25.999
Mhm, there, delicious,
want some?

49:26.033 --> 49:29.002
- What is she...?
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Henry!

49:29.036 --> 49:31.405
She is putting weird,
friggin' hippy-dippy Indian shit

49:31.438 --> 49:33.173
into coffee,
that's what she's doing.

49:33.207 --> 49:36.109
Fuck you, Henry, you got me
all riled up and into it.

49:36.143 --> 49:38.045
- Fucking idiot, nonsense!
- I'm so... I...

49:38.078 --> 49:39.547
Idiot.

49:39.581 --> 49:41.081
Eric.

49:42.684 --> 49:44.351
Oh, god.

49:55.295 --> 49:57.264
- Go right inside.
- Yeah.

50:04.371 --> 50:05.851
What are you doing?
I know you did it.

50:07.642 --> 50:10.077
I know you did it.

50:18.452 --> 50:22.055
I know you're watching me,
you fucking pervert.

50:22.089 --> 50:24.258
I'm gonna find you,
and I'm gonna

50:24.291 --> 50:27.327
turn you into dog food.

50:27.361 --> 50:29.429
You hear me?

50:44.612 --> 50:46.313
It's okay.

50:46.346 --> 50:47.849
It's okay, Henry.

50:47.882 --> 50:50.083
She doesn't know who you are.

50:50.117 --> 50:52.452
She doesn't know.

50:52.486 --> 50:55.489
It's okay, it's okay.

50:55.523 --> 50:57.224
I'll be okay.

50:57.257 --> 50:59.561
It's okay, breathe.

51:21.381 --> 51:23.383
What is this?

52:33.855 --> 52:37.324
Get up! Get up!

52:37.357 --> 52:38.926
She killed her.

52:38.960 --> 52:40.904
- What, who killed who?
- Look, Ella, she killed Ella.

52:40.928 --> 52:42.840
- I saw it, I saw it.
- No, it's a nightmare, man.

52:42.864 --> 52:44.875
- You're having a nightmare.
- No, no, no, look, I saw it.

52:44.899 --> 52:47.434
I'll show you.

52:56.511 --> 52:58.646
It was... it was here,
it's... it's gone.

53:07.421 --> 53:09.356
I don't see a body, mate.

53:09.389 --> 53:11.859
She must've moved the body.

53:11.893 --> 53:15.530
Yeah, to the kitchen
'cause she's cooking her.

53:15.563 --> 53:17.264
Show me the apartment.

53:18.633 --> 53:20.968
She put, uh, tape.

53:25.740 --> 53:27.775
Maybe you should
see a doctor, mate.

53:29.510 --> 53:32.847
She killed Ella,
and now Laura's gonna punish me.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.982
Hope she punishes me
one day, eh?

53:38.318 --> 53:40.655
What if you took
a couple of your pills?

53:40.688 --> 53:43.256
No, like you said,

53:43.290 --> 53:45.960
they're not good for me.

53:45.993 --> 53:48.529
I don't wanna take 'em anymore.

59:09.950 --> 59:11.952

59:22.163 --> 59:24.698
The mask,
she was wearing the same mask.

59:26.300 --> 59:29.603
Take any of those pills, mate?

59:29.637 --> 59:31.872
No.

59:31.906 --> 59:34.208
What's going on with our killer?

59:34.241 --> 59:38.913
She put tape over her camera,
but I can still hear

59:38.946 --> 59:40.848
her electric knife.

59:40.881 --> 59:42.216

I'd get you rent today,

but just so happens
I have a call back,

59:49.056 --> 59:51.725
right now, and my agent says
it's pretty much a done deal,

59:51.759 --> 59:54.028
so as soon as
I get a check on that,

59:54.061 --> 59:56.263

59:56.297 --> 59:59.066
Absolutely promise,
second I get it, all right?

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.401

01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.076
Come on,
I had a terrible weekend,

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.736
I'm not in the mood for this.

01:01:12.273 --> 01:01:13.707
Cheer up.

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:18.245
Play me a song or something.

01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:19.914
We need to talk.

01:01:19.947 --> 01:01:21.715
Mm-hm.

01:01:21.749 --> 01:01:23.784
Well, I told you on day one,

01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:26.854
I do not wanna hear,
"we need to talk."

01:01:26.887 --> 01:01:29.056
Hm.

01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:31.825
Thought I was clear
about our arrangement, huh?

01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:34.028
No bullshit.

01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:35.362
I'm pregnant.

01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:52.213
How much is it gonna cost
to get rid of it?

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:54.848
- I'm thinking about keeping it.
- No way, no.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:58.752
I can't deal with this bullshit.

01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:01.322
- How do I even know it's mine?
- It's yours.

01:02:01.355 --> 01:02:03.991
Is this your plan,
think you can scam me?

01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:05.893
- Of course not!
- What do you want?

01:02:08.195 --> 01:02:10.064
I think you should leave.

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:14.969
Hey, this is my place.

01:02:16.971 --> 01:02:18.973
I paid for this apartment.

01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:21.543
Leave? Who the hell's apartment
you think this is?

01:02:21.576 --> 01:02:23.277
Leave now.

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:39.893
Nobody cares about the baby.

01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:48.530
Dad?

01:04:19.993 --> 01:04:22.363
Oh, you want my underwear?

01:04:22.396 --> 01:04:24.666
- Yeah.
- 500, and you can pay

01:04:24.699 --> 01:04:27.067
- through my website.
- Take PayPal?

01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:28.502
Sure.

01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.104
PayPal's fine.

01:04:30.137 --> 01:04:31.606
- All right.
- I wish you were here

01:04:31.639 --> 01:04:34.475
so you could help
take them off of me, big boy.

01:04:34.509 --> 01:04:37.111
Oh, yeah.

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:41.649
Hey, hey,
I brought you breakfast.

01:04:41.683 --> 01:04:43.951
- Thanks.
- What's going on?

01:04:43.984 --> 01:04:45.653
Oh.

01:04:45.687 --> 01:04:48.055
- Uh, did you get the part?
- No.

01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:50.057
- I was their second choice.
- Oh.

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.669
But, good news, they're
bringing me back next week

01:04:51.693 --> 01:04:55.062
for an even better show,
so, yeah.

01:04:55.095 --> 01:04:57.197
Feeling pretty positive
about it, to be honest.

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.666
Not hungry?

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.068
I need...

01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:03.036
I need... I need the rent,

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.347
'cause you know,
you're a month late,

01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:08.008
and you didn't leave
the security deposit.

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:11.345
Why are you
doing this to me, huh?

01:05:11.378 --> 01:05:12.523
Haven't I been
a good friend to you?

01:05:12.547 --> 01:05:14.281
Why you busting my balls?

01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:17.719
You know I'm gonna pay you,
with interest, all right.

01:05:17.752 --> 01:05:21.088
You... you are a good friend,
but... but I've got insurance

01:05:21.121 --> 01:05:23.023
and property tax,
and I can't lose this place.

01:05:23.056 --> 01:05:25.125
Okay, how about this,
how about this?

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:26.694
Okay?

01:05:26.728 --> 01:05:28.996
You can airbnb my room,
and I'll move into that room...

01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:31.533
- That room is off limits!
- The garage.

01:05:31.566 --> 01:05:33.033
The garage,
I can move stuff around.

01:05:33.066 --> 01:05:36.136
I just need more time,
bro, that's it, I swear.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:38.673
Can I just say, you are
no pleasure to live with either?

01:05:38.706 --> 01:05:40.407
I mean, seriously,
you always wake me up

01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:42.209
with your nightmares,
and your obsession

01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:43.521
with these women...
Not many people

01:05:43.545 --> 01:05:45.112
would put up with that, Henry.

01:05:45.145 --> 01:05:47.181
Then leave.

01:05:49.483 --> 01:05:51.586
Come on, you're not
really angry with me.

01:05:51.619 --> 01:05:54.988
It's these women,
they're driving you crazy, bro.

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:56.567
And can I just say,
we should resolve this?

01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:58.459
And I know exactly how.

01:05:58.492 --> 01:06:00.294
- I bring Laura over here.
- No.

01:06:00.327 --> 01:06:02.071
What do you think about that?
That's what we should do.

01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:03.741
- No, no, you can't do that.
- I will teach you, Henry.

01:06:03.765 --> 01:06:05.475
- No, you can't do that!
- You don't have to go crazy

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:07.267
whenever a woman
comes into the room.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.112
I'll be right there with you,
it'll be completely fine.

01:06:09.136 --> 01:06:10.538
Just give me more time!

01:06:13.508 --> 01:06:16.076
I didn't inherit
a house like you.

01:06:19.246 --> 01:06:21.148
You're my one true friend in la.

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:25.587
I mean, haven't you been happier
since I moved in?

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.287
I have been happier,

01:06:27.321 --> 01:06:28.523
and I'm grateful.

01:06:30.525 --> 01:06:32.594
But the bank needs money.

01:06:32.627 --> 01:06:33.795
Fine.

01:06:35.663 --> 01:06:37.431
Fine, I'll be out
by the weekend,

01:06:37.464 --> 01:06:40.300
and I'll get you your money,
I'm not a thief.

01:06:42.369 --> 01:06:44.471
But, you know what,
once I get you that money,

01:06:44.506 --> 01:06:46.373
- we're done.
- Well, come on, Eric,

01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:47.685
doesn't have to be that way,
we could...

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:49.711
No, you know what?

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.412
You know what, fuck you.
Seriously, fuck you!

01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:53.824
You know what
your problem is, Henry?

01:06:53.848 --> 01:06:55.482
You're obsessed
with a piece of ass,

01:06:55.517 --> 01:06:57.293
and because you don't know
how to nail her down,

01:06:57.317 --> 01:07:00.722
you make up all these stories to
fulfill your fucking empty life.

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:03.223
You know, all I have to do
is say one word to anybody

01:07:03.257 --> 01:07:04.568
about this,
and you're going away.

01:07:04.592 --> 01:07:07.427
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:07.461 --> 01:07:09.496
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:11.431
Fuck, I'm sorry, hey.

01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:13.601
I'm so sorry, mate.

01:07:13.635 --> 01:07:16.470
Fuck, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:18.438
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:19.774
I'm sorry, mate.

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:24.812
I'm sorry, I was angry, bro.

01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:26.380
I'm not gonna blackmail ya.

01:07:28.282 --> 01:07:29.517
I'm an artist.

01:07:33.387 --> 01:07:35.590
But, this,

01:07:35.623 --> 01:07:37.324
it's all in your head, Henry.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:41.763
I know what I know.

01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:53.399
Hi, honey.

01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:54.801
Are you there?

01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:57.170
Yeah, yes.

01:08:57.203 --> 01:08:58.740
I can't hear you.

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:04.845
- I'm here.
- Are you shy?

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.380
Yes.

01:09:08.247 --> 01:09:10.183
You don't need to be, okay?

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:12.486
But, if I can't hear you,
then we can't do this,

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.656
and I have to shut you off.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:16.658
You understand?

01:09:16.691 --> 01:09:19.326
Yes.

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.328
So?

01:09:25.232 --> 01:09:27.367
Oh, okay.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:29.435
Go on.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:32.205
What's your name?

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:33.774
Henry.

01:09:33.808 --> 01:09:36.944
Is this your first time
doing this?

01:09:36.978 --> 01:09:38.845
Yes.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.782
Don't be nervous, Henry.

01:09:40.814 --> 01:09:42.984
Uh.

01:09:43.017 --> 01:09:45.720
So, what do you wanna see?

01:09:47.254 --> 01:09:49.524
Uh, I don't know.

01:09:52.392 --> 01:09:55.462
What's your favorite fruit,
Henry?

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:58.900
Do you like strawberries?

01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:01.334
Bananas?

01:10:01.368 --> 01:10:03.336
Blueberries?

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.972
Grapes?

01:10:05.006 --> 01:10:06.974
Mangoes?

01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:09.010
Figs.

01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:13.480
Figs?

01:10:13.514 --> 01:10:16.383
That is an unusual request.

01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.720
I don't have any figs.

01:10:18.753 --> 01:10:23.624
Maybe we can settle
for strawberries.

01:10:23.658 --> 01:10:25.927
They're soft on the inside,
and...

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.731
I didn't really come
to talk about fruit.

01:10:29.764 --> 01:10:31.966
Okay.

01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:34.434
Let's try something else.

01:10:34.468 --> 01:10:38.873
Uh, uh, just... just please...
Please... please stop... stop that.

01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:41.341
I think you called
the wrong person.

01:10:41.374 --> 01:10:43.678
This is what I do.

01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:45.046
What is it you want?

01:10:46.914 --> 01:10:50.651
Just to talk, please.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.623
Okay, what do you
wanna talk about?

01:10:57.825 --> 01:11:00.061
I don't... I don't know,
maybe would be nice

01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:02.830
to maybe meet in person

01:11:02.864 --> 01:11:04.732
and talk, and, you know, we...

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.467
Henry, I only do webcam.

01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:09.637
I'm not a call girl.

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.607
Plus, we're probably
not even in the same state.

01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:16.376
You're... you're in la, right?

01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:18.045
What?

01:11:18.079 --> 01:11:20.782
Yeah, you're...
You're in silver lake.

01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:22.926
I'm not... I'm not that far away,
we could meet up for coffee,

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:27.088
and you know, just talk
about anything you want and...

01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.890
How do you know that?

01:11:28.923 --> 01:11:31.025
Listen, you creep,
stay away from me,

01:11:31.058 --> 01:11:33.628
and never contact me again,
or I'm calling the cops.

01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:35.029
I have your
credit card information

01:11:35.062 --> 01:11:36.531
and I will put you away to jail.

01:11:36.564 --> 01:11:37.674
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Do you hear me?

01:11:37.698 --> 01:11:39.466
I'm sorry, I didn't... I'm sorry.

01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.832
I can stand
being spoiled a little.

01:13:17.865 --> 01:13:20.167
The gentleman I'm going to see
did very little spoiling.

01:13:20.201 --> 01:13:22.069
I'd like to spoil him just once.

01:13:22.103 --> 01:13:23.479
You sure you don't want me
to go in with you?

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:24.538
No, no, I can handle it.

01:13:24.572 --> 01:13:26.332
Well, if things get rough,
remember I'm here.

01:13:41.989 --> 01:13:43.958
Hey, look at this.

01:13:43.991 --> 01:13:45.760
Yeah.

01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:47.460
Woo!

01:13:52.199 --> 01:13:55.202
I can't wait for you all night.

01:13:55.236 --> 01:13:57.538
Why don't you
put the fucking mask on?

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.845
Wear it now, or go back
to your room and stay there.

01:14:14.555 --> 01:14:16.190
What is this?

01:14:27.068 --> 01:14:28.703
Tessa.

01:15:37.104 --> 01:15:39.073
No.

01:15:42.143 --> 01:15:44.145
No, no, no.

01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:05.766
How do you know about that?

01:16:11.939 --> 01:16:13.974
Laura?

01:16:16.077 --> 01:16:17.378
Dad?

01:16:26.787 --> 01:16:29.824
No, no, I'm not gonna...
I can't... I'm not gonna...

01:16:40.101 --> 01:16:41.702
Who's there?

01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:45.106
I said who's there?

01:16:45.139 --> 01:16:47.208
Come out.

01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:51.679
Don't move or I'll shoot.

01:16:56.317 --> 01:16:58.786
Please, no, no.

01:17:23.711 --> 01:17:26.947
Hey, uh, so I got a job
at a restaurant,

01:17:26.981 --> 01:17:29.250
and I asked for
an advance to pay rent,

01:17:29.283 --> 01:17:30.885
and they said
they'd think about it.

01:17:34.755 --> 01:17:37.391
So, that's... anyway,
I'm gonna go out.

01:17:37.424 --> 01:17:39.326
Uh.

01:18:25.072 --> 01:18:27.975
This is for you, mate.

01:18:40.788 --> 01:18:42.223
Ah, hello, cutie.

01:18:42.256 --> 01:18:44.959
Hello, cutie.

01:18:44.992 --> 01:18:47.228
Let me make you a drink.

01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:50.030
Okay, act... actually, you know
what, I'm okay for a drink.

01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:52.800
I... I think I've had enough.

01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:55.402
Honey,
it's never enough with me.

01:18:55.436 --> 01:18:57.504
Ha.

01:18:57.539 --> 01:19:01.875
And I am going to make you...

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.513
something very special.

01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:15.823
- There.
- Oh, thank you.

01:19:15.856 --> 01:19:17.958
Yeah, come on,
don't be a party pooper.

01:19:17.992 --> 01:19:21.195
- Just come on.
- Yeah.

01:19:21.228 --> 01:19:23.230
- Let's toast.
- All right.

01:19:23.264 --> 01:19:24.865
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:19:29.069 --> 01:19:30.437
- What's up?
- Huh?

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:33.107
Do you think I'm gonna
roofie you or something?

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.175
Ah, no.

01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:37.512
No, the... no, I'm just...

01:19:37.545 --> 01:19:39.346
No, I'd prefer yours, though,

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.949
'cause, you know, lipstick.

01:19:46.353 --> 01:19:48.322
- Ahh.
- Wow.

01:19:48.355 --> 01:19:50.057
Huh?

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.193
Oh, I love a man
who can hold his liquor.

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:54.928
Mm, yeah.

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:56.864
Okay, while you finish yours,
I'm gonna go

01:19:56.897 --> 01:19:58.832
make myself another.

01:19:58.866 --> 01:20:01.101
Yeah, wait, wait, wait,
lipstick.

01:20:09.644 --> 01:20:11.078
That's it.

01:20:13.013 --> 01:20:15.015
- Thank you.
- Hm.

01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:24.158
Ahh.

01:20:26.193 --> 01:20:28.128
Nice apartment.

01:20:28.162 --> 01:20:29.496
Thanks.

01:20:31.533 --> 01:20:33.334
How was your drink?

01:20:33.367 --> 01:20:35.102
Oh, it's delicious, thank you.

01:20:35.135 --> 01:20:37.037
- Mm, good, enjoy.
- Very delicious.

01:20:37.071 --> 01:20:39.574
- Thanks.
- By the way.

01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:41.108
- Hm?
- I don't know if anyone

01:20:41.141 --> 01:20:43.444
ever told you,
but you have a beautiful,

01:20:43.477 --> 01:20:46.380
beautiful neck.

01:20:46.413 --> 01:20:48.449
Ahh.

01:20:48.482 --> 01:20:52.152
You turn me on.

01:20:52.186 --> 01:20:54.254
Ah.

01:20:54.288 --> 01:20:56.290
Well.

01:20:59.993 --> 01:21:02.597
- Well?
- Uh-huh.

01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:04.064
Cheers.

01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:08.502
I wanna kiss every inch of you.

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:11.539
Mm, so romantic.

01:21:11.573 --> 01:21:14.174
- Married?
- What? No.

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:15.476
Oh.

01:21:17.277 --> 01:21:20.314
Friends shouldn't keep secrets,
don't you agree?

01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:22.584
Oh, for sure.

01:21:22.617 --> 01:21:24.552
So,

01:21:24.586 --> 01:21:28.922
do you like other people
watching us?

01:21:28.956 --> 01:21:32.359
Or you prefer
to have sex in private?

01:21:32.393 --> 01:21:34.294
Huh?

01:21:34.328 --> 01:21:36.397
Oh, hi there.

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.299
Eric, could you introduce me
to your friend?

01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:42.970
What are you talking about?

01:21:43.003 --> 01:21:45.507
That one.

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.709
I thought we agreed
to no secrets.

01:21:47.742 --> 01:21:49.276
Uh.

01:21:49.309 --> 01:21:53.581
But, you took the tape off,
didn't you?

01:21:55.382 --> 01:21:58.152
I don't... I...

01:21:58.185 --> 01:22:01.355
- I should go.
- No, that's okay.

01:22:01.388 --> 01:22:03.123
Don't worry.

01:22:03.157 --> 01:22:05.593
I just thought it's rude

01:22:05.627 --> 01:22:08.328
not to say hello
to our mutual friend.

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:10.632
Hm?

01:22:10.665 --> 01:22:14.702
I know, why don't we
invite him over?

01:22:14.736 --> 01:22:16.270
- Hm?
- I've...

01:22:16.303 --> 01:22:18.038
Or,

01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:21.074
we can go to his place.

01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:23.210
Okay, I've... I've made a mistake.

01:22:23.243 --> 01:22:24.978
Um, I'm gonna go, okay?

01:22:25.012 --> 01:22:26.557
I'm just... I should...
I should just go.

01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:29.416
- No.
- Oh, my god.

01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:32.319
One more kiss, baby,
just before you go.

01:22:35.088 --> 01:22:37.257
No, what are you doing?

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:39.527
No, this...

01:22:39.561 --> 01:22:41.629
I'm sorry, this was a mistake.

01:22:41.663 --> 01:22:43.665
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:22:46.568 --> 01:22:48.135
Tell me his name.

01:22:49.303 --> 01:22:52.707
Tell me his name.

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.108
His name's Henry.

01:22:55.142 --> 01:22:57.077
Hm.

01:22:59.213 --> 01:23:02.349
Hello, Henry.

01:23:02.382 --> 01:23:04.586
Henry, why won't you come over

01:23:04.619 --> 01:23:06.487
and join the party?

01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.556
- He can't.
- Why not?

01:23:10.692 --> 01:23:13.227
Because he gets panic attacks
and he can't talk to girls.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.496
Oh, so he can just sit there,

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:19.066
and spy on me and jerk off?

01:23:19.099 --> 01:23:20.568
Apparently.

01:23:20.602 --> 01:23:25.172
Well, this is so fucked.

01:23:25.205 --> 01:23:29.076
Henry, why won't you
turn the webcam on

01:23:29.109 --> 01:23:31.111
so I can see you?

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:32.747
Leave him alone.

01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:36.116
Henry, I think I deserve to see

01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:38.553
the man who's been spying on me.

01:23:38.586 --> 01:23:41.488
Turn the webcam on.

01:23:43.591 --> 01:23:45.560
Just turn it on, Henry.

01:24:07.515 --> 01:24:10.317
Hm.

01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:12.452
Young.

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:15.289
I thought he would be older.

01:24:15.322 --> 01:24:18.125
Well, Henry, why won't you

01:24:18.158 --> 01:24:21.128
come over tonight
so we could finish this nonsense

01:24:21.161 --> 01:24:24.364
- once and for all?
- I told you, he can't.

01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:26.133
Let's just forget it, huh?

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:28.468
Let's just forget it.

01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:31.739
Then, why are you here anyways?

01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:33.407
Hm?

01:24:35.877 --> 01:24:37.879
So, that your perverted friend

01:24:37.912 --> 01:24:39.446
could watch you
having sex with me?

01:24:39.479 --> 01:24:41.448
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not it at all.

01:24:41.481 --> 01:24:44.484
That's not it at all, I...
No, that's not it.

01:24:44.519 --> 01:24:46.688
I... what I wanted was...

01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:48.790
I wanted... I had...
I had to see you.

01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:53.260
I had to.

01:24:53.293 --> 01:24:56.363
I wanted to come here
so that we could...

01:24:56.396 --> 01:24:58.465
So we could fuck
in front of your friend?

01:24:58.498 --> 01:25:00.902
No, listen, look,
I agree with you.

01:25:00.935 --> 01:25:03.671
Henry, he is a weirdo.

01:25:03.705 --> 01:25:05.616
I mean, he sits in his room
all day and he looks at women,

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.643
and yes, I humor him,
but when I saw you...

01:25:10.912 --> 01:25:13.715
it was different.

01:25:13.748 --> 01:25:16.450
I wanted to touch you.

01:25:16.483 --> 01:25:18.251
I wanted to...

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:21.488
To smell you,
to gaze into your eyes,

01:25:21.522 --> 01:25:24.391
to... to kiss your lips.

01:25:24.424 --> 01:25:26.493
I couldn't stand seeing you
with other men, I...

01:25:26.527 --> 01:25:28.696
I wanted it to be me, you know.

01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:30.598
I mean, I knew...
I knew it could be.

01:25:30.632 --> 01:25:34.201
I know, yes,
I know it sounds crazy,

01:25:34.234 --> 01:25:36.236
and I know I'm probably
a piece of shit,

01:25:36.269 --> 01:25:38.506
and you could just, like,
tell me to get lost,

01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:40.551
or call the cops, and that
would be completely fair,

01:25:40.575 --> 01:25:43.310
but,

01:25:43.343 --> 01:25:44.946
I had to give us a chance.

01:25:48.315 --> 01:25:49.917
Hm.

01:25:49.951 --> 01:25:51.653
And you're
a very good bullshitter.

01:25:51.686 --> 01:25:54.221
No, I'm not bullshitting.

01:25:54.254 --> 01:25:57.290
When you kissed me,

01:25:57.324 --> 01:25:59.426
it felt as if
my heart might explode.

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:04.264
Well, it was a good kiss.

01:26:04.297 --> 01:26:06.366
Most men don't know how to kiss.

01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:12.305
Maybe one more kiss, huh?

01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:13.775
Before you kick me out.

01:26:29.824 --> 01:26:33.427
I should go, 'cause...

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.797
I'm sorry if you feel
I've deceived you.

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:38.432
I promise that Henry
won't bother you again,

01:26:38.465 --> 01:26:41.468
neither will I.

01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:44.572
I... I'll never forget you.

01:26:44.605 --> 01:26:46.941
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:48.609
Will you shut up?

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.422
Shall we?

01:27:15.036 --> 01:27:17.270
Bye, Henry.

01:28:28.509 --> 01:28:30.745
So, Laura's gonna
come pick me up.

01:28:30.778 --> 01:28:34.314
Gonna crash at hers
until I find my own place.

01:28:37.552 --> 01:28:40.922
Not that it means anything
to you, but,

01:28:40.955 --> 01:28:43.456
me and Laura really like
each other, Henry.

01:29:17.859 --> 01:29:19.794
Hey, I only got
half the deposit.

01:29:19.827 --> 01:29:21.394
I hope cash is okay.

01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:24.699
What are you wearing?

01:29:24.732 --> 01:29:26.767
You look like an idiot,
take that off, Henry.

01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:30.137
Seriously.

01:29:34.575 --> 01:29:35.877
What's going on?

01:29:37.845 --> 01:29:39.547
What are you doing, Henry?

01:29:53.227 --> 01:29:55.663
Hello.

01:29:55.696 --> 01:29:57.598
Hello?

01:29:59.867 --> 01:30:01.035
Eric?

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:04.639
Eric?

01:30:10.077 --> 01:30:11.679
Eric?

01:30:57.258 --> 01:30:58.926
Henry?

01:31:04.932 --> 01:31:06.233
Henry?

01:31:06.267 --> 01:31:08.002
Please help me.

01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:13.541
I'm hurt.

01:31:13.574 --> 01:31:15.910
Where are you?

01:31:15.943 --> 01:31:17.178
In here.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.848
Just hurry.

01:31:25.987 --> 01:31:27.555
I'm bleeding.

01:31:30.024 --> 01:31:32.293
I'm dying.

01:31:34.929 --> 01:31:36.230
I'm so scared.

01:31:38.733 --> 01:31:40.301
So cold and dark.

01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:44.605
I don't... I don't like the dark.

01:31:47.608 --> 01:31:49.643
Please help me.

01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:57.685
Help me.

01:32:09.897 --> 01:32:11.732
My son did something bad.

01:32:14.769 --> 01:32:17.838
Where is your son?

01:32:17.872 --> 01:32:20.341
He's in his room.

01:32:20.374 --> 01:32:23.044
I put him there.

01:32:23.077 --> 01:32:25.746
I lock him up
when he does something bad.

01:32:38.225 --> 01:32:39.360
Ahh.

01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:41.262
Please, please!

01:32:52.173 --> 01:32:54.742
Please!

01:32:54.775 --> 01:32:57.211
Please stop!

01:32:57.244 --> 01:32:58.979
Stop!

01:33:07.321 --> 01:33:09.623
Let go.

01:33:21.836 --> 01:33:23.304
Henry, please!

01:33:33.814 --> 01:33:36.851
I thought...
I thought I killed you

01:33:36.884 --> 01:33:39.687
and buried you in the yard.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.956
Now you're trying to blame me?

01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:51.165
I'm...

01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:53.901
I'm so sorry, I...

01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:56.137
I thought that you were
doing it the whole time,

01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:59.306
but it was... it was...
It was him.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.842
It was him.

01:34:01.876 --> 01:34:04.378
It was my dad. I'm so sorry.

01:34:04.411 --> 01:34:06.313
Don't be such
a fucking coward, Henry.

01:34:06.347 --> 01:34:08.782
- Fucking do it!
- No!

01:34:10.317 --> 01:34:13.287
Don't do it.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.356
Please.

01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:21.061
Fuck you!

01:34:21.095 --> 01:34:23.797
No, don't do it!

01:34:27.835 --> 01:34:30.304
Fucking do it!

01:34:34.408 --> 01:34:36.377
He's gonna live inside of me.

01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:38.045
He's not gonna let me go.

01:34:50.357 --> 01:34:52.259
You're never gonna let me go.

01:34:56.363 --> 01:34:57.898
I'm sorry.

01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:03.737
