02:38.264 --> 02:39.566
Hello?

03:10.263 --> 03:11.863
You call when you get there.
Okay?

03:11.865 --> 03:13.301
You call collect
at the restaurant.

03:13.766 --> 03:15.870
When I hear your voice,
I can add the charges.

03:16.068 --> 03:19.906
Pa, I think I can find a phone
to call and talk to you.

03:20.139 --> 03:21.875
It's okay. Save money.

03:22.643 --> 03:26.180
In case of emergency,
you need petty cash.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.683
Take it.

03:32.419 --> 03:33.721
You be good.

03:34.287 --> 03:35.823
Study hard.

03:36.156 --> 03:37.692
I'll see you at Christmas.

03:46.366 --> 03:47.702
I love you.

03:49.870 --> 03:50.837
Okay.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.201
Hi, roomie. I'm Jeanine.

04:55.468 --> 04:57.137
I'm so happy to meet you.

04:58.105 --> 04:59.006
Oh, this is my Mom.

05:00.107 --> 05:01.839
She likes to be called Mary
and not Mrs. Rockwell.

05:01.841 --> 05:03.474
She thinks it makes
her seem younger.

05:03.476 --> 05:06.276
Do not listen
to a word she says,

05:06.278 --> 05:07.478
but do call me Mary, dear.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.447
It's very nice to meet you.

05:09.449 --> 05:11.115
I'm Angie Wang.
It's nice to meet you.

05:11.117 --> 05:12.950
Hi, Angie.
Matt Rockwell, Jeanine's father.

05:12.952 --> 05:15.086
I already know I'm young
so I don't need the validation,

05:15.088 --> 05:16.691
but still feel free
to call me Matt.

05:16.923 --> 05:18.225
Very nice to meet you.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.961
Uh, Steve, brother.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.697
Pleasure.

05:22.995 --> 05:24.130
It's horrid.

05:24.764 --> 05:27.100
Honestly,
the utter lack of taste.

05:29.502 --> 05:32.402
Oh, Mother, for goodness sake.
Don't cry.

05:32.404 --> 05:33.837
I'll be fine.

05:33.839 --> 05:35.810
What is wrong?

05:39.913 --> 05:41.111
I hate you!

05:41.113 --> 05:44.382
Don't forget to call and try not
to eat too much junk food.

05:46.452 --> 05:47.487
You don't want to fall victim
to the freshman 15.

05:48.288 --> 05:49.286
- Just like your mother did?
- Uh.

05:49.288 --> 05:51.255
Come along dear while we
still have some dignity.

05:51.257 --> 05:52.258
Bye, Daddy.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.094
Take care, Angie.

05:54.461 --> 05:55.429
Great to meet you.

05:55.862 --> 05:57.898
- Same.
- Bye-bye. Love you.

06:01.033 --> 06:03.837
Good fucking, Lord.
I thought they'd never leave.

06:04.004 --> 06:06.140
I'm so sorry.
They're not always like that.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.206
I thought they were great.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.276
Oh, you're sweet.

06:09.810 --> 06:11.112
Are you ready for
a little treat?

06:11.978 --> 06:13.013
Sure.

06:19.451 --> 06:21.385
The bar is open.

06:21.387 --> 06:23.120
That is amazing.

06:23.122 --> 06:26.957
My mom does not know, of course.
She would blow a gasket.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.094
She's a fucking hypocrite.

06:29.196 --> 06:31.529
Stevie and I always sneak these
on family vacations.

06:31.531 --> 06:33.867
They make them
so much more tolerable.

06:34.533 --> 06:35.836
Try it.

06:37.303 --> 06:38.938
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:42.442 --> 06:43.911
Let's go find some fun.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.093
Stop!

07:36.228 --> 07:37.230
Fuck.

08:01.454 --> 08:03.921
Please look over
your course outlines.

08:03.923 --> 08:05.022
If you have any questions,

08:05.024 --> 08:08.058
feel free to see me
in my office.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.496
The hours are posted on my door.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.967
Until next time,
class is dismissed.

08:20.406 --> 08:21.341
Hi.

08:23.142 --> 08:24.143
Hi.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.045
Uh, I don't remember seeing
you in any classes last year.

08:27.047 --> 08:28.646
Who'd you have for 35?

08:28.648 --> 08:32.416
Oh, I'm a freshman now.
So I'm taking 35 too.

08:32.418 --> 08:34.587
What? With 36?

08:35.187 --> 08:38.024
That's unheard of.
Are you some kind of masochist?

08:38.390 --> 08:39.894
Yeah, you could say that.

08:41.293 --> 08:42.395
I'm Tommy.

08:43.363 --> 08:44.331
Angie.

08:48.301 --> 08:51.538
Hey, want to grab some lunch?
We can go to C-Cubed?

08:52.004 --> 08:53.036
What's that?

08:53.038 --> 08:55.009
C-Cubed, Crocker Cardinal CafÃ©.

08:55.174 --> 08:57.574
The food is infinitely better
than the dining halls.

08:58.577 --> 08:59.612
And if you have time,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.516
I can give you a little campus
tour on my scooter.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.051
Okay.

09:05.451 --> 09:06.220
Great.

09:07.354 --> 09:09.056
Hey, do you need
a license to drive a scooter?

09:09.655 --> 09:12.456
I have actually
almost the same pair.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.624
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

09:14.626 --> 09:16.462
Salvation Army
for prostitutes?

09:19.032 --> 09:20.434
- Alex.
- Hey, ladies.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.733
Welcome. My name is Alex,

09:22.735 --> 09:24.971
and I will be your
minister of fun for the evening.

09:25.538 --> 09:28.071
Are you, uh,
all set with drinks?

09:28.073 --> 09:29.342
We could use a round of drinks.

09:29.609 --> 09:31.144
Your wish is my command.

09:32.211 --> 09:34.478
That is Alex Hodge.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.681
Sophomore, swimmer,
training for Seoul, I think.

09:37.683 --> 09:40.283
Got a shoulder injury that might
keep him from trials in LA,

09:40.285 --> 09:42.020
but I'm not
a hundred percent positive.

09:42.022 --> 09:43.754
You're like a goddamn groupie.

09:43.756 --> 09:45.089
She is.

09:45.091 --> 09:46.424
Training for Seoul? What?

09:46.426 --> 09:48.963
Does he want to be, like,
a dancer or something?

09:49.229 --> 09:53.230
Seoul. Korea?
'88 Olympic games.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.068
Were you raised by wolves?

09:55.601 --> 09:57.471
He is one fine steed.

10:00.105 --> 10:01.375
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.774 --> 10:03.076
Thank you.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.243
Do you have anything
that's stronger than this

10:06.245 --> 10:09.647
watered down piss?
Might be nice to catch a buzz.

10:09.649 --> 10:11.985
Agreed.
What have you got there?

10:15.522 --> 10:17.121
- Water.
- I'm hydrating.

10:17.123 --> 10:19.059
- He's hydrating.
- Oh.

10:19.292 --> 10:22.763
You know, if you ladies are into
something a little more intense,

10:23.395 --> 10:25.131
I think I have just
the thing for you.

10:26.198 --> 10:27.133
Ladies.

10:27.533 --> 10:28.735
D, my man.

10:29.970 --> 10:32.469
I was just educating these two
lovelies about better living

10:32.471 --> 10:33.606
through pharmaceuticals.

10:35.674 --> 10:38.575
What is that? Valium?

10:38.577 --> 10:39.844
I don't want to pass out, guys.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.278
No, it's not Valium.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.549
My drug is heavy, hottie.

10:45.217 --> 10:47.517
- Ecstasy.
- Ecstasy?

10:47.519 --> 10:49.122
- Uh-huh.
- The club drug?

10:49.755 --> 10:51.692
- How much?
- Oh, please.

10:52.158 --> 10:54.392
For you two,
first hits are on me.

10:54.394 --> 10:57.228
You are quite the gracious host,
but we're going to pass.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.563
- Let's go, Ang.
- Oh.

10:58.565 --> 11:00.534
I'm down. Hit me.

11:02.268 --> 11:05.506
- Um, are you sure?
- You are my kind of girl.

11:06.239 --> 11:07.173
Yeah.

11:08.807 --> 11:10.343
Just let it melt on your tongue.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.513
Some of the best shit
on the market.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.311
Comes from a lab in Germany.

11:14.313 --> 11:15.748
Can't you get it domestically?

11:16.216 --> 11:17.848
It's tough, limited suppliers.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.753
My guy says it
flies off the shelves.

11:20.385 --> 11:23.423
- You won't be disappointed.
- Thank you, but no thanks.

11:24.356 --> 11:25.358
Let's dance.

11:27.659 --> 11:29.096
I'll see you guys in a bit.

12:03.562 --> 12:04.697
Fuck me, baby.

12:05.230 --> 12:06.497
- Yeah?
- Fuck me.

12:06.499 --> 12:07.598
- Yeah?
- Harder.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.766
Want me to fuck you?

12:08.768 --> 12:10.300
- Fuck me.
- Yeah?

12:10.302 --> 12:12.637
- Fuck me harder.
- You like that?

12:12.639 --> 12:13.774
Yeah, baby.

12:14.374 --> 12:15.642
You like when I fuck you.

12:19.745 --> 12:20.844
No!

12:24.517 --> 12:27.121
Just fuck her and
let's get the fuck out of here.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.619
- Hurry up.
- No!

12:29.621 --> 12:31.524
Yes. Yeah.

12:31.724 --> 12:32.658
No.

12:34.427 --> 12:35.825
No. It hurts.

12:37.663 --> 12:38.930
You want
some more beer, lady?

12:38.932 --> 12:41.601
Huh? You want some more beer?

13:09.629 --> 13:10.730
That was intense.

13:12.365 --> 13:13.366
Yeah.

13:18.538 --> 13:24.443
Hey, stud. Yeah.
I guess I owe you 20.

13:24.711 --> 13:25.812
Did you, uh?

13:26.511 --> 13:28.845
- No.
- Christen the pool table?

13:28.847 --> 13:29.916
What are you
talking about, dude?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.619
- What? We just... you know.
- Dude, shut the fuck up!

13:32.851 --> 13:34.587
Sorry about that.

13:35.587 --> 13:36.522
Yeah.

13:37.524 --> 13:40.826
You know what, frat boy?
I wasn't born yesterday.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.026
Tell you what,
when you collect that 20,

13:43.028 --> 13:44.364
you owe me ten.

13:47.299 --> 13:50.734
Oh, and uh, just as
a friendly piece of advice,

13:50.736 --> 13:53.371
you should really learn
how to eat pussy properly.

13:53.373 --> 13:55.473
Was that your first time?
Because it was sloppy.

13:55.475 --> 13:57.778
Worst fucking head I ever got.

14:01.780 --> 14:02.715
Shit.

14:16.528 --> 14:19.700
Sorry to wake you, Neen.
Go back to sleep.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.465
Where the hell were you?

14:22.467 --> 14:24.704
One minute you were
dancing and then...

14:25.471 --> 14:29.775
Oh, Sarah started spewing
everywhere like the Exorcist.

14:29.942 --> 14:31.776
All hell broke loose.

14:31.778 --> 14:34.078
- How is she?
- She's fine.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.314
That girl
just can't hold her liquor

14:36.316 --> 14:38.585
or her shitty watered down beer.

14:39.384 --> 14:41.687
Where did you go?
I tried to find you.

14:43.456 --> 14:44.557
Uh...

14:45.759 --> 14:50.931
I was dancing and then I turned
around, and you were gone.

14:51.831 --> 14:54.835
You hooked up with
that swimmer, didn't you?

14:55.033 --> 14:57.403
Just a little.

14:57.703 --> 14:59.002
We kissed.

14:59.004 --> 15:01.741
Just kissed? Bullshit.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.910
I hear that that XF
makes you very amorous.

15:05.677 --> 15:10.384
Oh, that was some kick ass dope.
I'm still rolling.

15:11.049 --> 15:14.484
Great. So now, you're going
to keep me up all night doping?

15:14.486 --> 15:16.522
Who the fuck says doping?

15:16.889 --> 15:18.325
White girl.

15:20.058 --> 15:21.327
Doper.

15:25.565 --> 15:26.633
Is that my bra?

15:27.899 --> 15:29.369
I was looking for that.

15:49.455 --> 15:50.624
Hey, is anyone home?

15:50.856 --> 15:53.793
Fuck with my motherfucking shit!
I'll get on you!

15:53.993 --> 15:55.762
What the fuck you want?

15:56.461 --> 15:58.532
Hi. I'm Angie Wang.

15:58.865 --> 16:02.568
I'm here to spend time with
Brianna from Big Sisters.

16:03.602 --> 16:06.872
Ah, yeah. Yeah, that.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.343
I thought you were
going to be white,

16:09.609 --> 16:12.045
rich white kid from Crocker.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.811
Well, I ain't rich
and I sure as shit ain't white,

16:14.813 --> 16:15.948
but I do go to Crocker.

16:22.955 --> 16:24.557
All right then.

16:25.725 --> 16:26.893
Come on in.

16:29.461 --> 16:30.596
Bree!

16:31.431 --> 16:32.629
- Bree!
- What?

16:32.631 --> 16:33.632
What the fuck's wrong with you?

16:34.833 --> 16:36.769
You get that shit on the carpet,
I'll bust you in the head!

16:37.537 --> 16:39.570
- You hear me, girl?
- I heard you!

16:39.572 --> 16:40.774
Y'all two shut the fuck up.

16:41.039 --> 16:42.509
Crocker lady here.

16:44.976 --> 16:45.911
Hey, Bree.

16:46.778 --> 16:47.813
I'm Angie.

16:48.514 --> 16:49.483
What are you watching?

16:50.484 --> 16:52.849
- <i>Sally Jesse.</i>
- Oh, I watch that sometimes.

16:52.851 --> 16:53.687
It's kind of funny.

16:54.754 --> 16:57.720
I'd rather watch cartoons,
but we only got one TV.

16:57.722 --> 16:58.491
Me too.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.825
My father and my brother used
to always watch <i>Tom and Jerry,</i>

17:01.827 --> 17:03.227
but I hated that.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.731
I used to wish Tom
would just eat Jerry.

17:06.031 --> 17:07.098
That's mean!

17:08.366 --> 17:11.069
I know, but I wanted to watch
<i>Josie and the Pussycats.</i>

17:11.471 --> 17:12.469
What's that?

17:12.471 --> 17:15.772
Oh, it's this excellent cartoon
about a group.

17:15.775 --> 17:18.508
They played music
and solved crimes.

17:18.510 --> 17:19.443
Were they cats?

17:19.444 --> 17:24.583
Nah, but they wore
pussycat ears and tails.

17:24.884 --> 17:25.885
Oh.

17:27.053 --> 17:29.990
So, I wanted to see if you
wanted to get some ice cream?

17:30.789 --> 17:31.724
Mama, can I?

17:34.926 --> 17:37.827
Ain't no place to get
ice cream around here.

17:37.829 --> 17:41.901
I was thinking, maybe we could
take the bus to University Ave.?

17:42.567 --> 17:43.901
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

17:43.903 --> 17:45.236
You need to get
her back by nine, though.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.740
She got school tomorrow.

17:47.173 --> 17:49.009
- Of course.
- You paying, right?

17:49.241 --> 17:51.241
I ain't got no cash
for no ice cream.

17:51.243 --> 17:52.578
Yeah, I got it.

17:53.179 --> 17:55.482
We could use some
soda and cigarettes.

17:55.847 --> 17:57.884
Maybe you could
pick some up for us?

17:59.585 --> 18:02.186
Are we really going
to get ice cream?

18:02.188 --> 18:05.759
Yeah, but you got to promise
to still eat your dinner, okay?

18:06.057 --> 18:07.560
I already ate it.

18:08.027 --> 18:10.594
Are you sure it wasn't lunch.
It's only three.

18:10.596 --> 18:11.728
What did you have?

18:11.730 --> 18:13.633
You saw, the cheese puffs.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.601
Those cheese puffs
weren't really dinner, though.

18:17.603 --> 18:19.236
They were just a snack, right?

18:19.238 --> 18:20.671
They were dinner.

18:20.673 --> 18:23.542
Mama said we ain't
got no food stamps yet.

18:25.877 --> 18:26.846
Are you hungry?

18:27.980 --> 18:30.049
- No.
- Well, I'm hungry.

18:30.249 --> 18:32.082
Let's see if we
can get something.

18:32.084 --> 18:33.119
Do you like pizza?

18:33.553 --> 18:35.121
I like McDonald's.

18:35.587 --> 18:37.857
Okay.
Let's see if we can find one.

18:38.223 --> 18:40.024
Really? And ice cream?

18:40.026 --> 18:41.225
And ice cream.

18:41.227 --> 18:43.028
You must be rich.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.871
Aw, fuck!

19:35.247 --> 19:37.014
<i>Yes.</i>

19:37.016 --> 19:38.248
Hey, Pa, it's Angie.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.218
<i>Angie, later time. Very busy.
Why you calling, huh?</i>

19:41.220 --> 19:42.956
<i>You in trouble? Everything okay?</i>

19:43.221 --> 19:44.188
Yeah.

19:44.190 --> 19:45.125
<i>What's up?</i>

19:45.857 --> 19:46.957
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.696
Just calling to say hi.

19:52.298 --> 19:53.963
<i>Look, I got a letter
from school.</i>

19:53.965 --> 19:56.967
<i>I can't afford more money.
Already working very hard.</i>

19:56.969 --> 19:59.636
<i>I told you Crocker
too expensive, for rich kids.</i>

19:59.638 --> 20:01.939
<i>Maybe you come home, huh?
Go to school in Newark.</i>

20:01.941 --> 20:03.707
<i>Told you
I can't afford that school.</i>

20:05.845 --> 20:08.277
What are you doing?
Come shopping with us.

20:08.279 --> 20:09.816
No, I can't.

20:17.189 --> 20:18.858
You must be rich.

20:25.730 --> 20:27.797
<i>Crocker too expensive,
for rich kids.</i>

20:27.799 --> 20:29.134
<i>Maybe you come home, huh?</i>

20:35.708 --> 20:37.009
<i>Comes from a lab
in Germany.</i>

20:37.410 --> 20:39.008
<i>Can't you get it domestically?</i>

20:39.010 --> 20:41.114
<i>It's tough, limited suppliers.</i>

20:41.747 --> 20:43.750
<i>My guy says it
flies off the shelves.</i>

21:47.946 --> 21:48.881
Hey.

21:49.848 --> 21:51.283
Hey.

21:51.983 --> 21:54.951
It looks like you
bought out the entire mall.

21:54.953 --> 21:58.822
I just wanted something sexier.
I'm tired of preppy.

21:58.824 --> 22:00.060
I look like fucking Gidget.

22:01.260 --> 22:03.262
You'd actually look better
in half this stuff than I would.

22:04.230 --> 22:05.198
Here.

22:06.365 --> 22:07.767
Take these.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.235
No, I couldn't.

22:09.934 --> 22:10.936
Why not?

22:11.938 --> 22:14.207
Take them or I take them
to the Salvation Army.

22:18.443 --> 22:21.714
In that case, thanks Neen.

22:22.013 --> 22:24.116
<i>De rien.</i>
I need the closet space.

22:24.849 --> 22:27.352
Hey, um, what are you
doing for Thanksgiving?

22:28.119 --> 22:30.389
Uh, I hadn't even
thought about it.

22:31.289 --> 22:34.728
I doubt I'll fly home, though.
It's too expensive.

22:35.361 --> 22:36.996
Why don't you come home with me?

22:37.296 --> 22:39.132
Our maids are really good cooks.

22:40.132 --> 22:41.065
Maids?

22:41.067 --> 22:43.267
Christ, would I have
to dress for dinner?

22:43.269 --> 22:46.873
Yep. Mary doesn't allow
riff raff at the dinner table.

22:48.406 --> 22:49.341
Oh, please.

22:50.343 --> 22:52.412
Save me from the misery
of my retched family.

22:53.179 --> 22:56.082
And my friend, Heath,
is having his annual rager.

22:56.281 --> 22:57.317
Say you'll come.

22:59.417 --> 23:01.787
Sure, Neen. I'd love to.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.957
Thanks for the invite.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.226
Oh, shit.

23:07.593 --> 23:09.362
Oh, shit! I got to go!

23:10.195 --> 23:12.298
Where the hell are you going?
It's a Saturday.

23:12.597 --> 23:15.097
Uh, I'm just working on
a project in the lab,

23:15.099 --> 23:17.136
and I needed to keep
my eye on it.

23:17.469 --> 23:19.404
Jesus.
You're never here anymore.

23:20.105 --> 23:23.039
- Meet for dinner?
- Maybe. I don't know.

23:23.041 --> 23:25.209
I've just got
so much stuff to do.

23:25.211 --> 23:28.914
But let's definitely go to the
Delta fucker, fucker party.

23:30.449 --> 23:31.785
See ya.

23:33.117 --> 23:34.052
Bye.

23:35.921 --> 23:38.324
I thought I'd find you
here, teacher's pet.

23:38.857 --> 23:40.326
How's your project coming along?

23:41.026 --> 23:42.128
Hi, Tommy.

23:43.127 --> 23:45.097
So, what are you,
uh, working on?

23:48.968 --> 23:51.403
What's this?
You're making aspirin?

23:53.905 --> 23:58.076
No. It's three, four
methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

23:59.211 --> 24:00.180
MDMA.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.381
You mean that party drug?

24:03.182 --> 24:05.585
I'm actually impressed
you know what it is.

24:06.117 --> 24:08.954
And you're doing what?
Are you synthesizing it?

24:09.188 --> 24:11.991
Yep. It's actually
pretty straightforward.

24:13.092 --> 24:15.025
I don't know whether
to be horrified

24:15.027 --> 24:17.096
or impressed with you right now.

24:18.230 --> 24:20.133
And I'm pretty sure
it's illegal.

24:20.365 --> 24:22.298
Wrong, wrong and wrong again.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.235
It's not actually on the list
of banned controlled substances.

24:25.237 --> 24:26.306
Shrinks use it.

24:27.373 --> 24:28.374
Here.

24:35.346 --> 24:37.016
Done by a Dow chemist, huh?

24:38.284 --> 24:39.252
Shulgin.

24:40.618 --> 24:42.422
Okay. I will admit
it's pretty interesting.

24:44.990 --> 24:47.192
Ang, this is pretty advanced.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.495
I could definitely
get you a job at Squib.

24:49.694 --> 24:52.464
Listen, there's a huge demand
for this shit.

24:52.932 --> 24:54.968
If you help me out,
I'll cut you in.

24:56.367 --> 24:57.569
No, Ang.

24:58.671 --> 25:02.075
I'm not like you. I can't handle
all that excitement.

25:03.041 --> 25:04.440
Look, I'm not gonna
rat you out,

25:04.442 --> 25:07.012
but I don't want any part of it.

25:10.516 --> 25:12.485
Seriously, be careful, please.

25:13.652 --> 25:14.985
I will, Tommy.

25:14.987 --> 25:16.489
I know how to
take care of myself.

25:21.093 --> 25:22.028
Remember that shit
you gave me last time?

25:22.827 --> 25:24.329
Found you
a domestic manufacturer.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.663
See if you can
move this tonight.

25:27.665 --> 25:29.167
I can get you more.

25:40.144 --> 25:42.414
I'm sold out.
When can I get more?

25:51.690 --> 25:53.026
You ready, Neen?

25:53.224 --> 25:54.459
I'm so ready.

25:54.660 --> 25:55.758
You might need
to change for dinner.

25:55.760 --> 25:59.164
Oh, shut up. Can we just get
this show on the road?

25:59.565 --> 26:00.967
Good fucking, Lord.

26:02.101 --> 26:03.667
Whoever heard of an 18-year-old
who can't drive a car?

26:03.669 --> 26:05.235
Why don't you have your license?

26:05.237 --> 26:08.942
Fuck you. I've driven.
I just don't have a license.

26:09.141 --> 26:10.440
I'm a great fucking driver.

26:10.442 --> 26:12.609
Well, you must have
been raised by wolves.

26:12.611 --> 26:14.380
Wolves have the best weed.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.226
- Ah.
- Oh.

26:27.425 --> 26:28.560
Let's do it.

26:39.438 --> 26:40.540
Hello?

26:41.105 --> 26:42.773
- Hi.
- Shh.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.807
Pull yourself together.
Shh, shh.

26:44.809 --> 26:47.777
Oh, my God.

26:47.779 --> 26:49.315
Oh.

26:50.182 --> 26:51.116
No.

26:52.050 --> 26:53.385
How's your breath?

26:53.719 --> 26:54.988
Hmm...

26:56.255 --> 26:58.488
it's okay if you're a member of
a fucking reggae band.

26:58.490 --> 27:00.123
We'll be in my room.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.290
Where's your room?

27:01.292 --> 27:02.758
It's upstairs. Come on.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.795
You have
a really big house.

27:04.797 --> 27:07.000
You have a really big mouth.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.401
- Shh.
- Shh. You shh!

27:13.672 --> 27:15.341
Oh, ooh!

27:15.540 --> 27:17.109
Are you okay?

27:20.746 --> 27:22.179
Hey, Mom says to hurry.

27:22.181 --> 27:24.213
Easy for her to say.

27:24.215 --> 27:27.285
I haven't been drinking at the
goddamn beauty parlor all day.

27:27.586 --> 27:30.620
Neen, please. No drama tonight.

27:30.622 --> 27:33.789
Everybody's in a good mood.
Let's keep it that way. Okay?

27:33.791 --> 27:36.428
Sorry, Stevie? Is she coherent?

27:36.694 --> 27:38.030
Only just.

27:40.665 --> 27:42.134
You guys have weed?

27:45.369 --> 27:46.505
Neen, you should always share
drugs with your little brother.

27:47.440 --> 27:48.671
Where is the sense
of familial obligation?

27:50.709 --> 27:51.811
You girls getting enough?

27:52.277 --> 27:53.176
- Oh, Yeah.
- So good.

27:53.178 --> 27:54.710
- Yeah, absolutely.
- It's so delicious.

27:54.712 --> 27:58.084
I think it's quite clear
that Jeanine has had enough.

27:59.117 --> 28:00.419
What are you saying?

28:01.153 --> 28:04.723
I am simply saying
what everyone is thinking.

28:05.490 --> 28:07.724
- Mom.
- She gained a bit of weight.

28:07.726 --> 28:09.526
- This happens.
- Mary.

28:09.528 --> 28:11.561
This happens the first
semester of college,

28:11.563 --> 28:14.067
but sweetheart,
you just have to be careful.

28:14.266 --> 28:15.632
You need to back off.

28:15.634 --> 28:17.299
You're absolutely right, Mother.

28:17.301 --> 28:21.337
All I am saying is you are
very lucky to have gotten into

28:21.339 --> 28:24.306
Crocker in the first place. So
you better make the best of it.

28:24.308 --> 28:26.910
That is bullshit!
She earned it, and you know it!

28:26.912 --> 28:30.613
It is not a time
to just be disregarding...

28:30.615 --> 28:32.548
- Dad, let it go.
- ...taking care of yourself.

28:32.550 --> 28:34.383
- Remember when you were little?
- You do this all the time!

28:34.385 --> 28:35.785
- You were always the one.
- Can you please?

28:35.787 --> 28:37.153
- I knew from that time.
- Back off!

28:37.155 --> 28:38.854
Do you remember in kindergarten?

28:38.856 --> 28:40.158
You're not helping her!

28:41.425 --> 28:42.625
It would be nice if you
backed me up once in a while.

28:42.627 --> 28:44.894
Back you up? I don't
do enough as it is already?

28:44.896 --> 28:46.363
Jesus Christ!

28:46.365 --> 28:48.565
You always had to try
a little bit harder.

28:48.567 --> 28:51.200
Can we have Thanksgiving
where we don't do this?

28:51.202 --> 28:55.141
Angie, you are welcome
in our home anytime.

28:55.907 --> 28:57.007
Thank you for the invite.

28:57.009 --> 28:59.241
Maybe you should have
a little bit of water. Hmm?

28:59.243 --> 29:01.480
I think I am doing just fine.

29:01.779 --> 29:03.380
Why didn't you wear
the silk blouse?

29:03.382 --> 29:05.548
It looks so much nicer on you
than this.

29:05.550 --> 29:07.484
I'm going to go change
right now, actually.

29:07.486 --> 29:09.251
- Jeanine, please.
- That's terrific.

29:09.253 --> 29:10.786
- Please excuse me.
- You are excused.

29:10.788 --> 29:12.689
It looks lovely on you
that blouse.

29:12.691 --> 29:13.659
Jeanine.

29:15.527 --> 29:17.730
Nice. Really nice.

31:01.299 --> 31:02.835
Are you sure you're okay, babe?

31:03.067 --> 31:04.604
Yeah. I'm sure.

31:06.904 --> 31:09.241
Can you spare some of that shit?

31:09.775 --> 31:11.277
Always for you.

31:14.512 --> 31:17.613
Free at last.
Let's go have some fucking fun.

31:17.615 --> 31:18.683
Yes.

31:18.884 --> 31:21.721
Hey, so glad you can make it.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.920
Name your poison.
We've got it all.

31:23.922 --> 31:24.921
Tequila?

31:24.923 --> 31:26.389
- Yes.
- Shots.

31:26.391 --> 31:28.294
Yes. This way.

31:31.363 --> 31:33.466
- Ah, yes!
- Yeah!

31:33.765 --> 31:34.734
Uh-oh.

31:41.506 --> 31:43.409
Mm, yes.

31:44.476 --> 31:45.911
The party has officially begun.

31:47.746 --> 31:48.681
Yeah.

32:06.097 --> 32:07.930
You ladies are on fire.

32:10.068 --> 32:12.672
Ang has the most righteous
Ecstasy in all of California.

32:13.070 --> 32:14.005
I'm intrigued.

32:15.073 --> 32:17.910
Well, 25 bucks a hit
will quench your curiosity.

32:18.109 --> 32:19.644
It's well worth it.

32:20.144 --> 32:21.681
Here you go.

32:23.048 --> 32:24.450
There you go.

32:25.851 --> 32:27.753
- Get ready.
- Oh, yeah.

32:31.088 --> 32:36.959
Oh, shit.
I feel so fucking good! Ecstasy!

32:40.699 --> 32:43.699
Hey guys, did I
hear you say Ecstasy?

32:43.701 --> 32:45.671
Do you know where
I might be able to get some?

32:46.171 --> 32:47.773
How much do you want?

32:48.606 --> 32:49.508
Give me six.

32:51.609 --> 32:53.478
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:58.016 --> 32:59.982
Ang, where did you go?

32:59.984 --> 33:01.619
I'm right here.

33:02.820 --> 33:05.624
We need to get some
of whatever they're on.

34:20.699 --> 34:24.699
I can't believe I watched
the ice princess give a blowjob.

34:26.505 --> 34:30.106
My life is complete.
I can die a happy woman.

34:30.108 --> 34:31.710
Fuck you.

34:32.710 --> 34:36.047
Though I will admit,
I'm a convert.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.983
That stuff is rad.

34:39.184 --> 34:41.018
And it's lucrative too.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.987
How much money did you make?

34:43.722 --> 34:48.860
I sold all 100 hits, so $2500.

34:50.862 --> 34:53.896
Merry Xmas. Ho, ho, ho.

34:53.898 --> 34:55.634
Indeed you are.

35:16.887 --> 35:17.822
Anita?

35:19.623 --> 35:22.160
Looky here.
It's China girl from Crocker.

35:22.893 --> 35:25.864
Brianna!
Get your funky ass out here.

35:26.264 --> 35:27.766
Big Sister's here.

35:27.998 --> 35:29.767
Your fine Big Sister.

35:30.635 --> 35:32.771
Why don't you give a
big brother some sugar?

35:34.572 --> 35:36.007
Anita home?

35:36.675 --> 35:37.510
Anita!

35:38.376 --> 35:39.376
Yeah, that skanky ass
fucking bitch.

35:39.378 --> 35:41.276
- Yeah, she here all right.
- Yeah.

35:41.278 --> 35:43.014
Come on, bitch.
Get yo ass out here.

35:44.315 --> 35:45.283
What your ass doing here?

35:46.418 --> 35:47.786
You supposed to be getting us
some damn cigarettes.

35:48.887 --> 35:50.823
You gonna go some suck some dick
for some cigarettes?

35:51.690 --> 35:53.057
Huh?
Who the fuck you talking to?

35:53.224 --> 35:54.090
Who you talking to, huh?

35:54.092 --> 35:55.927
Who the fuck you think
you talking to?

35:56.994 --> 35:57.795
Motherfucker!

35:58.996 --> 36:00.996
Motherfucker! You going to come
in my mother-fucking house

36:00.998 --> 36:01.697
and try to beat on me!

36:01.699 --> 36:03.301
You get the fuck out of here!

36:03.668 --> 36:06.769
You get the fuck out of here,
motherfucker!

36:06.771 --> 36:09.141
I don't need you or
your crotch-rot ass pussy!

36:10.641 --> 36:12.742
I'm so sorry about that.

36:12.744 --> 36:14.744
- What the fuck y'all looking at?
- Is Bree home?

36:14.746 --> 36:16.345
Yeah. She almost ready.
She coming.

36:16.347 --> 36:17.815
Where's Bree?

36:18.817 --> 36:19.585
Bree?

36:20.585 --> 36:21.853
Cigarettes. You need to get us
damn cigarettes!

36:23.320 --> 36:24.690
Bree?

36:25.090 --> 36:26.091
Come on out.

36:26.391 --> 36:27.693
It's Angie.

36:31.028 --> 36:31.963
Bree?

36:36.101 --> 36:37.036
Hey.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.137
How long you been in there?

36:40.972 --> 36:41.974
Are you hungry?

36:42.740 --> 36:44.576
Got some treats for you.

36:48.646 --> 36:50.982
It's okay. Come on out.

36:52.117 --> 36:53.786
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

36:54.853 --> 36:55.788
Promise.

36:58.322 --> 36:59.988
It's okay. I've got you.

37:02.193 --> 37:04.827
You want to come see where
I live? It's okay. I've got you.

37:04.829 --> 37:06.729
Ain't nobody gonna
take my baby from me!

37:06.731 --> 37:09.768
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. It's okay.

37:10.367 --> 37:12.334
I-I'm not taking her.

37:12.336 --> 37:14.804
I'm just taking her
out for ice cream, okay?

37:14.806 --> 37:16.208
Just like last time.

37:17.242 --> 37:18.210
I promised her.

37:20.244 --> 37:21.279
Yeah, Mama.

37:21.746 --> 37:25.017
Maybe I can get
you some cigarettes too?

37:26.384 --> 37:27.853
Baby.

37:31.121 --> 37:32.287
What kind? Menthol?

37:32.289 --> 37:33.889
- Menthols, yeah.
- Right?

37:33.891 --> 37:34.692
Yeah.

37:35.326 --> 37:37.829
Yeah, and go get my baby
some ice cream.

37:40.998 --> 37:41.899
Okay.

37:45.369 --> 37:46.904
We'll be back soon.

37:49.907 --> 37:51.175
Bye, Mama.

38:20.003 --> 38:20.670
Mama...

38:22.106 --> 38:23.976
...please don't go.

38:53.838 --> 38:56.238
We cannot just keep her here.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.775
Her mother must be worried sick,

38:58.777 --> 39:01.543
and you could get into
huge legal trouble.

39:01.545 --> 39:03.246
They can say that
you kidnapped her.

39:03.248 --> 39:05.782
Neen, her mother doesn't
know a dick from a crack pipe.

39:05.784 --> 39:07.182
She's high as fuck right now.

39:07.184 --> 39:10.722
Look at how fucking skinny
she is, and she's terrified.

39:10.989 --> 39:13.523
I can't let her go back to that.
She can't live like that.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.391
Then we'll call the authorities,

39:15.393 --> 39:18.327
Child Protective Services
or whatever they're called.

39:18.329 --> 39:22.565
I'm sure that they handle
situations like this every day.

39:22.567 --> 39:25.200
Yeah, they do.
That's the fucking problem.

39:25.202 --> 39:28.139
They see jillions of them,
and they don't give a shit.

39:28.472 --> 39:30.840
They don't try to
find them better homes.

39:30.842 --> 39:33.008
They just place them with
some shitty fucking family

39:33.010 --> 39:36.280
who, statistically speaking,
beat or try to fuck them.

39:37.148 --> 39:39.918
And then they usually wind up
back with their parents.

39:40.318 --> 39:43.151
So they learn never to tell
anyone their business,

39:43.153 --> 39:45.023
never to trust.

39:45.356 --> 39:47.055
How do you know all this?

39:47.057 --> 39:49.927
Did you take some
social work course or something?

39:50.862 --> 39:54.133
I'm not just some
spoiled brat debutant.

39:55.333 --> 39:58.103
I just don't want to see you
get in over your head.

39:58.369 --> 39:59.771
I know, Neen.

40:00.505 --> 40:01.940
And I'm sorry.

40:02.507 --> 40:04.076
I just feel helpless.

40:06.411 --> 40:07.780
It's okay.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.315
We'll get through it.

40:29.199 --> 40:30.301
Good morning.

40:31.135 --> 40:32.237
What's up, kid?

40:32.536 --> 40:33.936
How you feeling?

40:33.938 --> 40:36.842
Okay. Are we at your house?

40:37.608 --> 40:40.112
Yeah. We're still at my dorm.

40:41.512 --> 40:42.481
You hungry?

40:42.981 --> 40:45.217
Yeah. Where's my Mama?

40:48.552 --> 40:52.021
Bree, do you have a grandma
or an auntie

40:52.023 --> 40:53.892
you can stay with
for a little while?

40:54.224 --> 40:55.960
My grandma in Alabama.

40:57.561 --> 40:59.063
How about a friend?

40:59.496 --> 41:00.832
You.

41:03.501 --> 41:04.836
I am your friend.

41:05.168 --> 41:07.306
Let's see if we can
get you cleaned up.

41:12.443 --> 41:14.246
Mama, I'm home.

41:14.512 --> 41:15.847
Mama!

41:16.179 --> 41:17.213
Mama!

41:17.215 --> 41:18.417
Hey, baby.

41:18.949 --> 41:20.184
Baby, where you been?

41:20.451 --> 41:22.385
- At Angie's.
- At who?

41:22.387 --> 41:23.452
My Big Sister.

41:23.454 --> 41:25.186
Girl, you ain't
got no Big Sister.

41:25.188 --> 41:27.391
Why you always got to talk
so much shit, huh?

41:27.925 --> 41:31.063
Hey, Anita.
I'm Angie. Remember?

41:31.429 --> 41:32.865
Bree was with me.

41:33.597 --> 41:36.201
I brought you some groceries.

41:39.003 --> 41:42.637
Yeah, I do remember.
I am... I'm so sorry.

41:42.639 --> 41:45.141
I'm just a little bit out of it.
Bree, go...

41:45.143 --> 41:47.278
go grab your Mama
a beer out the fridge.

41:54.952 --> 41:57.054
I know what you
must be thinking about me.

41:59.023 --> 42:01.326
I wasn't always like this,
you know? I was...

42:02.293 --> 42:07.499
I was studying to be a nurse,
almost graduated, too.

42:12.103 --> 42:13.905
Why didn't you graduate?

42:18.009 --> 42:19.978
Bree's Daddy got killed.

42:22.713 --> 42:25.049
Couldn't do it all by myself.

42:28.219 --> 42:30.286
Then I met Darnell.
He seemed so strong.

42:30.288 --> 42:33.088
He said, "I'm going to take care
of you and your baby,

42:33.090 --> 42:35.993
and he did for a bit.

42:37.061 --> 42:39.398
It just felt so damn good
to breathe,

42:41.733 --> 42:44.036
just catch my breath.

42:45.702 --> 42:47.204
And then what happened?

42:48.072 --> 42:51.606
Well, he lost his job
at the county,

42:51.608 --> 42:53.277
couldn't find nothing else.

42:53.610 --> 42:56.480
That shit messed with the
motherfucker's head, you know?

42:57.782 --> 42:59.684
His two brothers got killed.

43:00.351 --> 43:03.084
One brother graduated from
high school,

43:03.086 --> 43:05.190
was fixin' to go to college.

43:05.556 --> 43:07.358
Got shot right
around the corner.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.430
Then he started
drinking too damn much.

43:13.063 --> 43:14.365
And then the rock.

43:18.335 --> 43:21.005
That motherfucking rock.

43:27.478 --> 43:28.512
It was like...

43:30.614 --> 43:32.416
it was like taking a vacation,

43:33.384 --> 43:34.318
um...

43:35.652 --> 43:38.189
floating in
the middle of the ocean.

43:41.759 --> 43:43.258
Lasted ten seconds.

43:43.260 --> 43:46.130
I been chasing that feeling
ever since.

43:51.668 --> 43:53.269
Bree, where you at?

43:53.271 --> 43:54.373
I'm here.

43:55.139 --> 43:57.142
I opened it for you, Mama.

43:58.108 --> 43:59.311
Thank you, baby.

44:07.150 --> 44:08.319
So, what'd you do today?

44:09.487 --> 44:11.554
Angie took me to this place
and there's all the cereal

44:11.556 --> 44:13.324
and hamburgers you can eat!

44:13.757 --> 44:16.093
I want to go to
college too, Mama!

44:17.161 --> 44:18.363
That's nice, baby.

44:19.163 --> 44:22.465
Yeah, and we rode in
a white bitch's fancy car!

44:22.467 --> 44:24.568
And I was chilling
in the back seat!

44:24.835 --> 44:27.338
Oh, that's, that's
my friend's car.

44:27.871 --> 44:30.641
She's actually waiting for me.
I should go.

44:31.576 --> 44:33.411
Uh, thank you so much.

44:51.496 --> 44:53.632
I'll see you next week,
Breena Butter.

44:59.637 --> 45:00.869
You wanna watch TV with Mom?

45:00.871 --> 45:03.140
- Yeah.
- Um-hm.

45:03.574 --> 45:04.606
What you want to watch?

45:04.608 --> 45:06.374
I want to watch cartoons.

45:06.376 --> 45:07.478
All right.

45:08.612 --> 45:09.580
Anita?

45:12.349 --> 45:14.318
You did a really
good job with her.

45:16.753 --> 45:18.123
She's a good girl.

45:31.168 --> 45:33.637
All right, baby.
Tell me about that bitch's car.

45:34.505 --> 45:36.505
So, Aspen or...

45:36.507 --> 45:38.409
They want to go
somewhere tropical.

45:39.376 --> 45:40.311
How'd it go?

45:41.244 --> 45:43.147
As well as can be expected.

45:44.181 --> 45:46.517
Bree has food for
the next couple of days.

45:47.918 --> 45:50.653
Thank you,
not just for the ride

45:50.655 --> 45:53.258
but for hooking her up with
all the food and the goodies.

45:53.925 --> 45:56.724
You don't have a monopoly
on soy, you know.

45:56.726 --> 45:58.526
Maybe just on the dance floor.

46:00.965 --> 46:01.900
You're welcome.

46:03.166 --> 46:07.403
Anyway, as I was saying, I just
couldn't imagine being so far

46:07.405 --> 46:10.405
from home on a holiday
that is all about being home,

46:10.407 --> 46:12.309
and I don't want to
leave my friends.

46:12.842 --> 46:14.211
Just, maybe I'm too...

46:16.547 --> 46:20.416
For those of you in shock over
seeing a low grade...

46:20.418 --> 46:21.950
- Oh, shit.
- ...on your exams,

46:21.952 --> 46:25.157
I have a bit of advice.
Get used to it.

46:25.623 --> 46:28.559
This is one of the toughest
classes you will take.

46:28.858 --> 46:31.327
I posted my office hours.

46:31.329 --> 46:35.700
You'd do well to avail
yourselves of my offer to help.

46:38.302 --> 46:40.568
So what exactly are you saying?

46:40.570 --> 46:43.438
I'm saying that it
sends them to the roof.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.574
Eww, I don't think
I could ever do that.

46:45.576 --> 46:48.679
It's the prostate.
It makes them ejaculate faster.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.715
You frighten me.

46:51.748 --> 46:53.784
Two o'clock.

46:54.251 --> 46:56.851
Maybe you can, uh, demonstrate
on one of them for us.

46:56.853 --> 46:58.954
Oh, ladies.
I am already on that shit.

46:58.956 --> 47:01.657
- Trust me.
- Don't puke this time, Sarah.

47:01.659 --> 47:03.291
Silence, urchin.

47:03.293 --> 47:04.693
Watch and learn, ladies.

47:04.695 --> 47:05.764
<i>Buenos noches,</i> ladies.

47:06.563 --> 47:08.363
You're all
looking quite fetching.

47:08.365 --> 47:10.467
Who writes your dialogue,
Ricardo Montalban.

47:10.934 --> 47:12.971
Thank you. You're looking well.

47:13.403 --> 47:16.340
- Thank you.
- Hey, Alex. Happy holidays.

47:17.641 --> 47:21.309
So, are you up for some company
or is this a, uh, private party?

47:21.311 --> 47:23.514
- No. We'd love to have you.
- It's a girl's night.

47:24.748 --> 47:26.317
Please, join us.

47:26.617 --> 47:29.784
Pay no mind to our rude girl.
She's from New Jersey.

47:29.786 --> 47:30.888
It's not her fault.

47:31.989 --> 47:34.923
Okay. The more the merrier.
I got to take a leak.

47:34.925 --> 47:36.025
Please, excuse yourself.

47:38.996 --> 47:41.396
You can take
the girl out of Jersey,

47:41.398 --> 47:43.932
but you can't take the Jersey
out of the girl.

47:43.934 --> 47:45.237
You're so vulgar.

47:56.547 --> 47:57.514
Excuse me.

48:01.052 --> 48:02.621
Don't be late, Donnie.

48:07.490 --> 48:09.427
What? Are you following me now?

48:09.726 --> 48:10.661
Maybe.

48:11.663 --> 48:13.329
Why don't you kick it
with Sarah over there?

48:13.331 --> 48:15.097
I'm sure she'd be more than
happy to help you

48:15.099 --> 48:16.835
with your gambling issues.

48:17.068 --> 48:18.870
You know,
she's not really my type.

48:19.936 --> 48:21.537
Is that meant to devastate me?

48:21.539 --> 48:23.639
God, I'm trying
my fucking best here.

48:23.641 --> 48:25.673
All right? You made me work
so goddam hard.

48:25.675 --> 48:28.077
I fucked you
20 minutes after I met you.

48:28.079 --> 48:29.847
I'd hardly call that
a tough sell.

48:30.748 --> 48:31.715
It was a hot night.

48:31.981 --> 48:33.485
I barely remember.

48:33.784 --> 48:35.950
So, uh, it was nice
catching up with you,

48:35.952 --> 48:37.822
but, uh, I'm going to jet now.

48:38.556 --> 48:39.490
Uh...

48:45.795 --> 48:46.697
Friends?

48:57.574 --> 48:58.643
Damn.

49:02.079 --> 49:03.414
That was hot.

49:04.447 --> 49:06.083
I guess it was okay.

49:06.483 --> 49:08.485
You know, you are
a tough nut to crack.

49:09.719 --> 49:12.589
It's like you're guarding this
deep dark secret.

49:13.623 --> 49:15.724
I'm just who you see
in front of you.

49:15.726 --> 49:16.894
Oh, bullshit.

49:17.695 --> 49:18.863
Who is Angie Wang?

49:20.097 --> 49:22.867
What do you do for fun?
What do you love?

49:24.601 --> 49:25.603
Jesus.

49:26.003 --> 49:27.034
I don't know.

49:27.036 --> 49:31.039
Uh... I guess I love to dance.

49:31.041 --> 49:32.740
All right, dancing.

49:32.742 --> 49:34.108
It's a good release.

49:34.110 --> 49:36.478
You know, actually I-I can think
of a release

49:36.480 --> 49:39.847
that's far superior to that.

49:39.849 --> 49:40.983
Frat boy.

49:40.985 --> 49:45.086
This frat boy has some friends
that bounce at a place

49:45.088 --> 49:46.490
down in the city.

49:46.990 --> 49:49.057
- Want to go?
- I'm in.

49:49.059 --> 49:50.362
Awesome.

49:50.894 --> 49:52.597
I have a treat for you.

49:53.130 --> 49:54.398
All right.

50:00.503 --> 50:03.674
Primo Ex made by
my loving hands.

50:04.007 --> 50:06.777
Holy shit! You're the fucking
mystery Ex goddess.

50:07.545 --> 50:09.010
- Guilty.
- Oh, my God.

50:09.012 --> 50:11.146
All my friends at USC and SMU,

50:11.148 --> 50:12.514
everybody fucking knows
about you.

50:12.516 --> 50:15.583
You are a celebrity.
I'm not worthy.

50:15.585 --> 50:17.554
I bow humbly in your presence.

50:21.759 --> 50:22.927
Let me anoint you.

50:27.030 --> 50:28.400
Let's go.

50:40.677 --> 50:41.813
Pretty rad, huh?

50:42.079 --> 50:43.815
Holy shit.

50:44.949 --> 50:46.951
- Hold on a sec.
- Uh-huh.

50:49.552 --> 50:51.021
Two tequila shots.

51:02.065 --> 51:03.033
Thank you.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.903
To the land of milk and honey.

51:34.231 --> 51:35.834
Hey, I'll be right back.

51:49.045 --> 51:50.714
Um, excuse me.

51:57.086 --> 51:58.856
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

52:14.804 --> 52:16.875
I'm done here. Let's move on.

52:17.708 --> 52:18.675
Why?

52:19.309 --> 52:20.644
Let's go.

52:27.284 --> 52:29.885
My Mom...
well, she is the queen

52:29.887 --> 52:31.990
of the philanthropic world
in Orange County.

52:32.755 --> 52:36.594
Plays a mean round of golf
and loves a glass of wine.

52:38.027 --> 52:40.797
You should be with
somebody like your mother.

52:41.264 --> 52:43.734
Oedipus Rex
is not for me.

52:47.204 --> 52:51.776
So, what, you're looking
for something different?

52:53.376 --> 52:56.780
A dash of spice, danger.

53:00.951 --> 53:02.853
I just want to know
a little more about you.

53:05.021 --> 53:06.090
Why is that so hard?

53:09.393 --> 53:11.061
You want to know who I am?

53:21.237 --> 53:23.640
I'm whoever you want me to be.

54:57.967 --> 54:59.770
When did you say
your flight was?

55:00.269 --> 55:01.338
Uh, tomorrow.

55:02.440 --> 55:04.208
I leave early morning,
and I'll be home by dinner.

55:05.007 --> 55:07.678
I really wish you were
coming home with me, Ang.

55:08.112 --> 55:09.814
Yeah. Me too.

55:11.181 --> 55:12.750
I'll see you soon, though.

55:13.483 --> 55:14.985
Merry Christmas, Neen.

55:16.385 --> 55:18.787
Merry Christmas.
I love you.

55:18.789 --> 55:19.991
I love you too.

55:29.199 --> 55:30.365
Hey, Pa, it's me.

55:30.367 --> 55:32.704
<i>Hi, Angie. I got your message.</i>

55:33.003 --> 55:35.006
- <i>You got a job?</i>
- Yeah.

55:35.806 --> 55:37.972
Sorry I won't be able to
make it back for the holidays.

55:37.974 --> 55:41.011
<i>That's okay. I'm working anyway.
How's school?</i>

55:41.778 --> 55:43.845
Good. All A's.

55:43.847 --> 55:46.150
<i>Come back in
January, much cheaper then.</i>

55:48.251 --> 55:49.253
Okay, Pa.

55:51.155 --> 55:52.186
- <i>Okay.</i>
- I love you.

56:01.164 --> 56:02.400
Merry Christmas, Ang.

56:02.900 --> 56:04.235
Same to you, Tommy.

56:06.936 --> 56:09.170
- Thanks for letting me crash.
- Of course.

56:09.172 --> 56:11.241
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

56:15.846 --> 56:19.016
Ah, I loved this one
when I was a kid.

56:19.349 --> 56:21.885
Me too. Second only to Rudolph.

56:22.152 --> 56:23.019
Agreed.

56:24.086 --> 56:27.555
So, what's on the menu
for tonight? I'm starving.

56:27.557 --> 56:29.994
Ah, we always have Chinese food.

56:30.159 --> 56:32.260
Of course you do.

56:32.262 --> 56:34.499
And what about your family?
Your Mom cook?

56:35.097 --> 56:39.003
Uh, actually I wouldn't know.
She left when I was six.

56:39.902 --> 56:42.305
Uh... So, who raised you?

56:42.873 --> 56:44.108
You have aunties?

56:44.340 --> 56:46.978
Uh, that was my babysitter.

56:49.313 --> 56:51.782
My dad worked at a restaurant
so he was never home.

56:52.416 --> 56:54.085
You have a brother, right?

56:54.384 --> 56:55.318
Yeah.

56:55.518 --> 56:57.788
But my mother took him with her.

56:58.121 --> 57:00.791
So, it's just me
and my TV friends.

57:02.960 --> 57:04.195
Did you ever see them?

57:05.561 --> 57:09.333
Um, not for about five years.

57:11.467 --> 57:13.303
Then she married
some white dude.

57:17.407 --> 57:19.110
I haven't seen her for a while.

57:19.943 --> 57:23.014
- You always lying! Lying!
- I'm not lying. He gave me...

57:24.213 --> 57:27.150
But, uh, I talk to my
brother sometimes.

57:28.652 --> 57:31.322
Oh, um, I almost forgot.

57:34.224 --> 57:35.927
Merry Christmas, Tommy.

57:41.164 --> 57:43.231
- Periodic table.
- Perfect.

57:43.233 --> 57:46.101
For your collection.

57:46.103 --> 57:47.038
Yes.

57:48.905 --> 57:51.972
Oh, and the scarf is Chinese red

57:51.974 --> 57:54.344
to keep you warm
on your scooter.

57:55.244 --> 57:56.246
It's cashmere.

57:57.213 --> 58:00.585
Wow, cashmere.
I don't own anything cashmere.

58:01.018 --> 58:02.320
Well, now you do.

58:04.387 --> 58:05.387
Looks good.

58:05.389 --> 58:06.524
Thanks.

58:07.123 --> 58:09.025
I have something for you.

58:24.340 --> 58:25.576
Oh, my God.

58:26.043 --> 58:27.478
It's beautiful, Tommy.

58:28.411 --> 58:30.013
I-I got it in Chinatown.

58:30.246 --> 58:33.180
I thought a cross would
protect your heathen soul.

58:35.585 --> 58:37.554
And it's a perfume bottle.

58:38.288 --> 58:41.291
Holy shit!
It's a stash necklace!

58:42.192 --> 58:45.396
What?
The guy said it was for perfume.

58:45.628 --> 58:47.030
It's perfect.

58:48.632 --> 58:50.501
I love it. Thank you.

58:56.072 --> 58:58.909
I think it's my favorite
Christmas present ever.

59:11.320 --> 59:12.322
Hey.

59:13.190 --> 59:14.258
Hey, Mom.

59:14.458 --> 59:16.927
Tommy!

59:17.393 --> 59:19.462
Angie.

59:22.532 --> 59:23.634
Welcome.

59:24.768 --> 59:28.239
Tommy said you very smart,
but he not say how pretty.

59:28.605 --> 59:30.074
Oh, thank you.

59:30.340 --> 59:31.275
You hungry?

59:31.574 --> 59:34.177
I'm starving. How can I help?

59:34.577 --> 59:35.776
I like her, Tommy.

01:00:27.197 --> 01:00:28.532
Sure you can't stay?

01:00:28.798 --> 01:00:32.400
Uh, I wish I could,
but I promised my uncle

01:00:32.402 --> 01:00:35.306
I'd spend Christmas
with them so...

01:00:35.771 --> 01:00:37.507
My family really likes you.

01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:41.244
They're great, Tommy.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.152
I think you're pretty great.

01:00:49.418 --> 01:00:50.554
Tommy, look at me.

01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:52.690
I'm not great.

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:56.490
I'm just a good friend
and nothing more. Trust me.

01:00:56.492 --> 01:00:58.061
Ang, I know what I see.

01:00:59.161 --> 01:01:01.765
I know what you do
for that little girl at APA.

01:01:02.364 --> 01:01:07.702
You have a big heart, and you're
brilliant and beautiful to boot.

01:01:07.704 --> 01:01:09.336
Anyone would be lucky to have...

01:01:09.338 --> 01:01:11.738
Please don't talk to me like
that! Promise me, Tommy!

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.411
I'm crazy!
I'm not for you, okay?

01:01:16.579 --> 01:01:17.778
I don't get you.

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.083
No, you don't.

01:01:20.217 --> 01:01:23.186
And thank God, because
you wouldn't be my friend if...

01:01:25.222 --> 01:01:28.359
Merry Christmas.
I'll see you next Thursday.

01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:30.592
Merry Christmas, Angie.

01:03:27.643 --> 01:03:29.346
Papa, papa.

01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:35.483
I told you to go to sleep! Okay?
You go to sleep!

01:03:35.485 --> 01:03:36.985
I say go to sleep!
You go to sleep!

01:03:41.423 --> 01:03:42.692
Oh, shit.

01:03:47.864 --> 01:03:49.800
We've had a
difficult time sourcing.

01:03:50.266 --> 01:03:52.700
We would be very happy
to distribute the Ecstasy

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:53.604
in our nightclub.

01:03:54.003 --> 01:03:55.739
- For a fee.
- For a cut.

01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:58.542
We will take all
that you can supply,

01:03:58.842 --> 01:04:01.478
and I'm sure we can come to a
mutually beneficial arrangement.

01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:02.813
Yes.

01:04:03.612 --> 01:04:04.748
Let's hope so.

01:04:12.355 --> 01:04:15.657
I'd like to remind you
there is a quiz next week.

01:04:15.659 --> 01:04:21.231
So please, be prepared
and class is dismissed.

01:04:25.034 --> 01:04:27.870
Ang? What's up?
You want to grab some lunch?

01:04:28.505 --> 01:04:33.041
Um, I'm sorry. I'm late.
Uh, but lunch tomorrow.

01:04:33.043 --> 01:04:34.378
I love you.

01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:36.779
Uh, okay.

01:04:37.746 --> 01:04:38.648
See ya.

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:41.382
This is not what we agreed to.

01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:43.920
I'm not busting my ass
for $18 a unit!

01:04:44.387 --> 01:04:45.920
Think of it as
a volume discount.

01:04:45.922 --> 01:04:47.521
You know what? Angie...

01:04:47.523 --> 01:04:51.261
Shut the fuck up, Alex!
No one is talking to you!

01:04:53.063 --> 01:04:55.266
Fine. Find your own ride.

01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:58.800
You're squeezing me,
and I don't like it!

01:04:58.802 --> 01:05:02.003
I can make just as fucking much
selling it myself!

01:05:02.005 --> 01:05:04.438
I just want
what I'm entitled to.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440
And what would that be?

01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:06.409
The split we agreed to.

01:05:07.376 --> 01:05:08.976
I'm afraid that I cannot
honor that, my dear.

01:05:08.978 --> 01:05:10.878
No money, no dope, no deal.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.419
I think you need to rethink
your position, my dear!

01:05:20.556 --> 01:05:22.356
No wonder you were a fat kid.

01:05:22.358 --> 01:05:23.960
Tommy, you eat like a pig.

01:05:24.393 --> 01:05:27.530
I need sustenance, okay?
That exam was brutal.

01:05:28.398 --> 01:05:30.030
Even you must have
had a hard time.

01:05:30.032 --> 01:05:31.067
Yeah, I bombed it.

01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:33.537
Holy. I don't believe it.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:34.871
Well, believe it.

01:05:35.438 --> 01:05:36.706
Did you get what
I asked you for?

01:05:37.974 --> 01:05:41.575
Yeah, I did, but Ang, this is
the last time I do this. Okay?

01:05:41.577 --> 01:05:42.545
Okay.

01:05:48.117 --> 01:05:50.117
Jesus, I asked you
for a fucking rotary one,

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:51.855
not a single press dimwit!

01:05:53.722 --> 01:05:56.590
Do you know how long it takes
to press a thousand pills?

01:05:56.592 --> 01:05:57.958
I'm falling behind
in production.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.193
I can't make this shit
fast enough!

01:05:59.195 --> 01:06:02.965
This one is industrial grade,
which is what you asked for.

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:05.868
I can't smuggle out
a damned rotary press!

01:06:06.135 --> 01:06:08.135
This could cost me my job,
you know?

01:06:08.137 --> 01:06:09.840
Quit being a fucking pussy!

01:06:10.539 --> 01:06:14.478
I'm not a pussy, Ang. I just...
I'm not crazy.

01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:19.349
Look, maybe you should
slow down.

01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:20.750
Take some time.

01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:24.655
Your grades...
you look exhausted.

01:06:25.454 --> 01:06:26.787
You could get in
serious trouble.

01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:28.722
Spare me one of
your sermons, Tommy.

01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:30.460
It's not illegal to have
a pill press, you know?

01:06:30.726 --> 01:06:33.463
Yeah, but it is to steal one
from a pharmaceutical company.

01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:38.465
On a more festive note,
did you remember that

01:06:38.467 --> 01:06:40.568
it's your beloved friend's
birthday this week?

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.373
You're coming
on Thursday, right?

01:06:43.873 --> 01:06:44.775
Oh, shit.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.778
Tommy, I'm so sorry.
I forgot. I'm busy.

01:06:49.045 --> 01:06:52.849
Look, uh, what if I take you out
clubbing this weekend instead?

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:55.719
The royal treatment, okay?

01:06:57.219 --> 01:07:00.490
All right. But try to come
Thursday if you can.

01:07:00.757 --> 01:07:03.927
No can do,
but we're on for Saturday.

01:07:05.728 --> 01:07:06.697
Okay.

01:07:08.197 --> 01:07:09.500
Check, please.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.166
Tommy, you're such a
girl. Come on. Let's get going.

01:07:42.699 --> 01:07:45.101
Perfection takes time, Ang.

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:47.834
Besides, this is supposed to be
my night out.

01:07:47.836 --> 01:07:49.639
Just relax.

01:07:50.206 --> 01:07:52.643
Fine. Whatever.

01:07:52.909 --> 01:07:54.044
That's more like it.

01:07:55.277 --> 01:07:58.012
Now, talk to me. What's, uh,
new and exciting in your life?

01:07:58.014 --> 01:07:58.849
Give me the dirt.

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:02.920
Jesus, you really are the gayest
straight man I've ever met.

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:05.621
I will take that
as a compliment.

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:07.255
Okay, let's see.

01:08:07.257 --> 01:08:09.525
Uh, I'm hating classes.

01:08:09.826 --> 01:08:12.092
Alex is getting
more predictable.

01:08:12.094 --> 01:08:13.760
Oh, and here's the shocker.

01:08:13.762 --> 01:08:16.596
My narcissistic cunt of a mother
keeps calling

01:08:16.599 --> 01:08:17.935
and asking to see me.

01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:21.037
Wow..

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:24.073
Are you going to see her?

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.743
I have nothing to say
to that bitch!

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.881
Ang, you know
I'm your friend, right?

01:08:31.613 --> 01:08:34.850
I'm always on your side.
I just want you to be okay.

01:08:35.618 --> 01:08:39.022
Yeah, I know, Tommy.
Thanks.

01:08:40.657 --> 01:08:43.493
And as your friend,

01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:48.532
I just want to say that maybe
it's time you talked to her.

01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:50.765
You know, bury the hatchet.

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:54.636
I think it's the only way
for you to be happy.

01:08:55.805 --> 01:08:59.040
Don't hold on to so much anger.
It's not good for you.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.511
That's what the Buddhists say.

01:09:00.777 --> 01:09:03.514
I'll take it under advisement,
Jiminy Cricket.

01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:06.015
What?

01:09:06.282 --> 01:09:07.684
Jiminy Cricket.

01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:09.185
I don't know what that is.

01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:12.786
You know,
Pinocchio's cricket friend

01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:15.091
who was actually his conscience.

01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.060
You don't know Jiminy Cricket?

01:09:18.661 --> 01:09:22.698
Seriously, Ang,
just think about it.

01:09:27.036 --> 01:09:29.037
Hey, how are you?

01:09:31.073 --> 01:09:32.073
What's up?

01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:33.809
Hey.

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:37.813
Holy shit.
You know everyone here.

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.684
I told you. VIP all the way.

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:42.249
- Uh, Ang?
- Hey.

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:43.185
Yeah.

01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:46.622
I'm embarrassed to ask,
but what's a VIP?

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:48.957
A very idiotic prick.

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:52.093
No, seriously.

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.131
Shut up, Tommy.

01:09:54.697 --> 01:09:58.098
Just relax. Have a good time.
It is your birthday.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.001
It is.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:04.641
Hey, this is my friend, Tommy.
It's his birthday tonight.

01:10:06.975 --> 01:10:11.113
Uh, can we get
another bottle of this?

01:10:13.248 --> 01:10:16.116
- Wow.
- It's your special night, buddy.

01:10:16.118 --> 01:10:17.119
Thanks.

01:10:24.127 --> 01:10:27.294
This is life. Holy Toledo.

01:10:27.296 --> 01:10:30.764
I've never felt
this good before, ever.

01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:32.269
Happy birthday, Tommy.

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:34.837
I love you, and you're the best.

01:10:35.137 --> 01:10:36.970
Thanks. I love you too.

01:10:36.972 --> 01:10:37.908
Cheers.

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:43.410
- Whoa.
- Oh, damn.

01:10:43.412 --> 01:10:44.981
This stuff's delicious.

01:10:45.881 --> 01:10:48.749
You might want to slow down
and pace yourself there.

01:10:48.751 --> 01:10:50.317
You don't want to
go out like a punk.

01:10:50.319 --> 01:10:52.022
What? Me?

01:10:52.755 --> 01:10:53.957
I'm a professional.

01:10:54.423 --> 01:10:55.225
A professional.

01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:58.291
All right. If you say so.

01:10:58.293 --> 01:10:59.762
It's your birthday.

01:11:01.396 --> 01:11:02.332
I'm gonna dance.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:04.134
Erm, go get 'em killer.

01:11:18.314 --> 01:11:20.784
You're next.
Make him feel special.

01:11:22.752 --> 01:11:25.452
Here, for your troubles.

01:11:25.454 --> 01:11:26.922
Oh, nice.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.027
He's worth like 35 bucks.

01:11:30.792 --> 01:11:32.358
Excuse me.
What did you just say?

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.861
Oh, I was just telling my friend

01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:36.066
it cost like 35 bucks to buy
this here.

01:11:36.733 --> 01:11:37.967
Thirty-five?

01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:39.202
Uh, yeah.

01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:40.300
I mean, it's not cheap,

01:11:40.302 --> 01:11:43.039
but it is
the best shit there is.

01:11:44.439 --> 01:11:46.842
Make sure he has
the time of his life tonight.

01:12:06.095 --> 01:12:07.698
You motherfucker.

01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.801
Ang, I don't feel so good.

01:12:12.435 --> 01:12:13.668
- Hey.
- I got to get out of here.

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:16.336
Hold on for a minute. I need
to take care of something first.

01:12:16.338 --> 01:12:17.974
Yeah, okay.

01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:20.508
Hey, can you take care of him?

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:22.009
Grab him a Ginger Ale
or something.

01:12:22.011 --> 01:12:23.313
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.146
Take me outside.

01:12:25.148 --> 01:12:27.217
- Are you okay?
- I think I'm going to puke.

01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:31.285
You know, you're hot.

01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:35.089
You're like an angel right now.

01:12:35.091 --> 01:12:36.123
That's very sweet.

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:38.358
No, like, seriously.
We should...

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.128
we should go out
somewhere sometime.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.263
Why don't we go outside?

01:12:42.265 --> 01:12:46.267
I should warn you. I've...
I've never had sex before.

01:12:46.269 --> 01:12:48.137
Uh, I'll keep that in mind.

01:12:51.439 --> 01:12:53.440
Angie, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

01:12:53.442 --> 01:12:54.444
You having a good night?

01:12:55.444 --> 01:12:57.279
I was until I heard some
pretty disturbing news.

01:12:57.512 --> 01:12:59.146
What ever could you have heard?

01:12:59.148 --> 01:13:01.752
You're so full of shit,
you greasy motherfucker!

01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:04.884
- Angie, you should calm down.
- Calm down?

01:13:04.886 --> 01:13:07.987
I just heard you're making
35 fucking dollars

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:10.558
for the Ex
I am busting my ass to make!

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.860
And you have
the fucking audacity

01:13:12.862 --> 01:13:14.294
to squeeze my side too?

01:13:14.296 --> 01:13:18.432
You cock sucking piece of shit!
Give me my money!

01:13:18.434 --> 01:13:20.233
You should watch your mouth

01:13:20.235 --> 01:13:23.036
because it could get you in
some trouble someday.

01:13:23.038 --> 01:13:25.305
Fuck you! This is my money!

01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.943
You crazy little whore!

01:13:29.511 --> 01:13:32.047
You fucking cunt!

01:13:33.882 --> 01:13:35.851
Ang, I don't feel good.

01:13:36.484 --> 01:13:37.585
Ang?

01:13:41.423 --> 01:13:42.324
Tommy!

01:13:45.328 --> 01:13:46.263
Tommy.

01:13:47.162 --> 01:13:50.263
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:13:50.265 --> 01:13:51.835
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:13:52.068 --> 01:13:54.271
No, Tommy. Oh, no.

01:13:59.942 --> 01:14:02.212
Somebody help me!

01:14:02.545 --> 01:14:04.577
You'll be okay.
You're going to be okay.

01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:06.914
You're going to be...
You have to be okay.

01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:09.920
Somebody help me, please.

01:14:10.286 --> 01:14:12.189
Somebody help me.

01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:17.458
Tommy friend, huh?

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.561
- Yes.
- No.

01:14:19.028 --> 01:14:20.963
- No drinking.
- Yes.

01:14:22.297 --> 01:14:25.001
I'm sorry.
We weren't able to save him.

01:14:25.501 --> 01:14:27.334
Tommy!

01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:30.874
Tommy!

01:14:31.274 --> 01:14:33.977
You have to save him!

01:14:40.615 --> 01:14:42.152
Hi.

01:14:47.523 --> 01:14:49.458
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

01:14:56.431 --> 01:14:58.167
I'm not for you, okay?

01:15:23.693 --> 01:15:25.662
You! Get out!

01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:28.097
My Tommy was a good boy!

01:15:28.296 --> 01:15:32.031
He no drink! He no go to clubs!
That was you!

01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:35.438
The drug dealer's
on bail already.

01:15:35.704 --> 01:15:36.939
This is your fault!

01:15:37.907 --> 01:15:39.943
You should be the one
in the ground today!

01:16:06.402 --> 01:16:10.206
Angie, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:10.439 --> 01:16:11.207
What?

01:16:12.173 --> 01:16:13.208
You would have gone
to the dork's funeral.

01:16:14.143 --> 01:16:16.246
It wasn't a
fucking social event, Jeanine.

01:16:16.578 --> 01:16:17.611
Come here. Let me help you.

01:16:17.613 --> 01:16:18.949
No.

01:16:19.247 --> 01:16:21.350
- Stop.
- Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:22.616
Angie.

01:16:22.618 --> 01:16:24.151
I'm sorry if I'm not up to

01:16:24.153 --> 01:16:27.090
Miss Martha's
fucking standards of etiquette.

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:30.260
How you're doing? I don't think
that this is helping.

01:16:30.725 --> 01:16:34.762
Stop. Stop! Stop! Look at me!
Let me help you!

01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:37.263
Fuck off me
and leave me the fuck alone!

01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:40.366
I don't need your fucking help!
You're the one that needs help.

01:16:40.368 --> 01:16:44.506
I'm not Mary!
I can hold my fucking liquor!

01:16:47.542 --> 01:16:49.410
Whatever the fuck
you want, Angie.

01:16:49.412 --> 01:16:52.082
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

01:16:52.747 --> 01:16:55.516
Leave me the fuck alone!
Tommy would hate this!

01:16:55.518 --> 01:16:56.451
You know that!

01:16:56.453 --> 01:16:59.422
I don't need any of you!
I don't need you!

01:17:21.543 --> 01:17:23.509
<i>In light of the
admission of guilt,</i>

01:17:23.511 --> 01:17:27.481
<i>the grave nature of the offenses
and the utter lack of remorse</i>

01:17:27.483 --> 01:17:30.483
<i>on the part of the defendant,
the judicial panel,</i>

01:17:30.485 --> 01:17:34.720
<i>on careful review, has
recommended immediate expulsion.</i>

01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:39.326
<i>All scholarships and grants

01:17:39.328 --> 01:17:41.829
<i>Additional restitution
to the chemistry department</i>

01:17:41.831 --> 01:17:43.500
<i>will be due promptly.</i>

01:18:32.715 --> 01:18:33.650
Hello?

01:18:33.882 --> 01:18:34.818
<i>Angie?</i>

01:18:35.819 --> 01:18:37.817
<i>Uh... It's, uh,
Stephen Rockwell.</i>

01:18:37.819 --> 01:18:39.555
<i>How are you? Look...</i>

01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:43.092
<i>it's about Jeanine.</i>

01:19:19.528 --> 01:19:20.463
Geez.

01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:24.531
I always thought I'd be
the first to wind up

01:19:24.533 --> 01:19:25.799
in the psych ward.

01:19:31.873 --> 01:19:34.344
I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:19:37.912 --> 01:19:39.848
You didn't call me.

01:19:40.416 --> 01:19:43.253
I thought you forgot about me.

01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:45.255
No.

01:19:45.787 --> 01:19:49.625
No, no. Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

01:20:10.878 --> 01:20:13.347
I think I can get some
leave-in conditioner

01:20:13.349 --> 01:20:15.318
downstairs at the drugstore.

01:20:16.952 --> 01:20:19.422
I know you only
like that salon shit.

01:20:20.488 --> 01:20:23.458
We're going to need a lot
to get through all these knots.

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.564
What the hell did you do?

01:20:30.599 --> 01:20:31.634
I don't know.

01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:38.608
Well, we'll get through it.

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:44.647
So, how much longer are
they going to keep you here?

01:20:46.981 --> 01:20:48.384
I don't know.

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:52.487
They're still concerned
about my...

01:20:54.289 --> 01:20:58.493
suicidal ideation.

01:21:02.797 --> 01:21:04.567
They think I'm crazy.

01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:11.441
You didn't really mean to do it,
did you?

01:21:13.809 --> 01:21:15.478
I don't know, Ang.

01:21:18.012 --> 01:21:19.849
I just felt so empty,

01:21:22.685 --> 01:21:25.588
like I was slipping
into nothingness.

01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:33.662
So I just kept taking
more and doing more.

01:21:36.864 --> 01:21:39.702
Next thing you know
I end up in the looney bin.

01:21:46.108 --> 01:21:48.677
I'm sorry I split like that.

01:21:56.051 --> 01:22:01.591
Um, please don't do
that again, okay?

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.693
Will you promise me?

01:22:05.993 --> 01:22:08.898
Because I couldn't bear
losing you too.

01:22:27.115 --> 01:22:29.484
This rat's nest
is finally coming out.

01:22:34.957 --> 01:22:36.826
You're really good at this, Ang.

01:22:49.104 --> 01:22:50.573
Thank you.

01:22:56.444 --> 01:22:57.846
Don't leave me.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.653
I promise you I won't.

01:23:14.796 --> 01:23:16.631
Let's keep fixing my hair.

01:23:17.565 --> 01:23:19.902
I can't face my public
like this.

01:23:23.204 --> 01:23:25.104
Well, we'd be
fucking done already

01:23:25.106 --> 01:23:27.542
if you weren't so damned
tender headed.

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.111
Sheesh, you're the
nappiest headed white girl

01:23:31.113 --> 01:23:32.845
I have ever seen.

01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:35.952
I missed you.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.655
I missed you too.

01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:50.500
This is absolutely
fucking absurd.

01:23:50.731 --> 01:23:53.799
I am completely
capable of walking.

01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:55.869
Jeeves, you're fired.

01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:58.004
Ugh, you're lucky I don't
dump your wrist cutting

01:23:58.006 --> 01:24:00.743
alcoholic white ass
out of this motherfucker.

01:24:01.143 --> 01:24:03.645
Can wait to shove you
in that fucking car.

01:24:04.046 --> 01:24:05.681
Where the hell is Matt?

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.525
So, what's next for you?

01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:19.996
Back to the club
and my little cage.

01:24:26.534 --> 01:24:29.471
Promise me you'll consider
going back to school, Ang.

01:24:30.238 --> 01:24:31.773
You're better than that.

01:24:34.976 --> 01:24:37.846
I mean, I don't know.

01:24:38.747 --> 01:24:40.917
Tommy wouldn't want
to see you like this.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:44.720
It would break his heart.

01:24:52.594 --> 01:24:54.963
What does your dad have
to say about all this?

01:24:59.935 --> 01:25:00.970
I don't know.

01:25:02.804 --> 01:25:05.574
I haven't seen him
since I left for Crocker.

01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:09.077
You should go visit
your Dad, Ang.

01:25:10.011 --> 01:25:11.880
He must be so worried about you.

01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:14.784
Jesus, get off me.

01:25:20.889 --> 01:25:22.692
You deserve a good life.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.575
So do you.

01:25:52.186 --> 01:25:53.655
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:25:54.122 --> 01:25:55.057
Angie.

01:25:57.326 --> 01:25:59.025
- You ready, pumpkin?
- Yeah.

01:25:59.027 --> 01:26:00.061
Let's get out of here.

01:27:30.318 --> 01:27:31.621
Hi.

01:27:32.186 --> 01:27:33.122
You're home.

01:27:35.289 --> 01:27:36.658
Hey, Pa.

01:27:43.064 --> 01:27:44.032
You hungry?

01:27:47.969 --> 01:27:49.070
Yeah, I am.

01:27:51.238 --> 01:27:52.974
I can heat leftovers.

01:28:00.181 --> 01:28:02.184
What do you think
you'll do for summer then?

01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:07.754
Uh, I was thinking of signing up

01:28:07.756 --> 01:28:10.726
for some summer classes
at Rutgers.

01:28:14.095 --> 01:28:15.296
School's good.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:17.799
You can work here
at the restaurant.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.836
Yeah. Maybe.

01:28:25.172 --> 01:28:26.708
Why didn't you call me?

01:28:31.378 --> 01:28:33.114
I didn't want you to know.

01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:35.951
I didn't want to disappoint you.

01:28:37.219 --> 01:28:38.688
Disappoint me?

01:28:41.523 --> 01:28:42.992
You're my daughter.

01:28:44.893 --> 01:28:47.826
But I know how
important school is to you,

01:28:47.828 --> 01:28:49.228
and I know how important it is.

01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:51.900
I just want you to be happy,

01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:55.237
to have a good life.

01:29:02.978 --> 01:29:04.814
What was your friend's name?

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.981
Thomas Lu.

01:29:09.283 --> 01:29:10.318
Tommy.

01:29:12.988 --> 01:29:13.956
Nice boy?

01:29:14.389 --> 01:29:15.291
Chinese?

01:29:16.024 --> 01:29:16.992
Yeah.

01:29:18.193 --> 01:29:19.762
He was a good guy.

01:29:21.962 --> 01:29:23.298
You would have liked him.

01:29:25.266 --> 01:29:27.269
He didn't deserve to die.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.907
You know, when I was young

01:29:34.909 --> 01:29:39.748
I had a friend from Hubei,
my best friend.

01:29:40.948 --> 01:29:43.018
We would race to school
every morning

01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:45.218
because the first ones in class

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:47.256
would win free <i>youtiao</i>
for breakfast.

01:29:50.891 --> 01:29:52.325
He was faster than me,

01:29:52.327 --> 01:29:57.365
but he would always wait for me
so that we both would win.

01:30:06.608 --> 01:30:10.212
The Japanese executed
his father right in front of us.

01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:21.222
The next time I saw him was
before we leave for Hong Kong.

01:30:22.457 --> 01:30:23.926
It was snowing.

01:30:24.993 --> 01:30:26.295
He was begging in the streets.

01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:33.201
No shoes, just fabric and rope
tied to his feet.

01:30:34.869 --> 01:30:36.738
He had his little sister
on his back.

01:30:40.609 --> 01:30:43.012
I gave the last
of my food to him,

01:30:44.613 --> 01:30:46.081
and, uh...

01:30:47.282 --> 01:30:48.884
he just fed his sister.

01:30:52.654 --> 01:30:54.356
I wish I could have done more.

01:30:58.493 --> 01:31:00.095
He must be dead.

01:31:04.198 --> 01:31:05.366
Life is cruel.

01:31:08.636 --> 01:31:10.405
Good people die, Angie.

01:31:14.509 --> 01:31:18.314
But we're not bad people
for surviving.

01:31:26.554 --> 01:31:27.523
You eat.

01:31:27.988 --> 01:31:29.257
I'm going to go sleep.

01:31:31.126 --> 01:31:32.161
Papa's tired.

01:31:41.636 --> 01:31:42.938
Pa...

01:31:44.271 --> 01:31:45.274
I love you.

01:32:01.221 --> 01:32:03.358
- It's going to be okay.
- Mm-hm.

01:32:04.024 --> 01:32:06.027
You're strong like papa.

01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:24.073
Can I help you with something?

01:33:25.539 --> 01:33:28.741
Hey, I saw the poster outside.

01:33:28.743 --> 01:33:30.212
I'm here about the job opening.

01:33:31.445 --> 01:33:33.612
You look a little precious,
and these are pretty tough kids

01:33:33.614 --> 01:33:36.318
we're dealing with,
gang bangers, drug dealers.

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:38.252
Do you think you
can handle that?

01:33:40.255 --> 01:33:41.190
Yeah.

01:33:44.225 --> 01:33:46.462
You could say
I have some experience.
