00:01.634 --> 00:03.227
- Previously on Roswell.
- Who are you?

00:03.303 --> 00:04.998
- I'm Tess.
- You're the new girl.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.870
So this must be the Isabel
my Tessie's been raving about.

00:07.941 --> 00:12.401
Daddy works for the army, tells them
how to run things. That's why we're in Roswell.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.413
- Max, Michael.
- What's going on?

00:14.481 --> 00:17.143
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

00:17.217 --> 00:20.585
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.587
This is the fourth alien we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.681
There's a crazy thing my father used to
talk about, something called a shape-shifter.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.251
Someone who could take on
the form of another person.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.456
<i>- There's no such thing as a shape-shifter.
- What if there is, Max?</i>

00:30.530 --> 00:32.692
I think it's all true, Michael.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.258
<i>You've seen them too,
haven? you?</i>

00:35.335 --> 00:37.565
<i>The dreams ?</i>

00:37.637 --> 00:39.605
I think I'm pregnant
with your child.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.869
It's all in here, Max.
It's our destiny. Think, Max.

00:42.942 --> 00:46.708
- <i>You've seen my flare before.</i>
- <i>Who is she, Max?</i>

00:46.780 --> 00:49.249
She's one of us.

01:01.193 --> 01:03.753
What do you mean,
she's one of us?

01:14.273 --> 01:16.605
Max, what is it?

01:16.675 --> 01:18.609
Max!

01:50.543 --> 01:53.274
- How did you-
- I just knew.

01:53.345 --> 01:57.475
- Max, we can't-
- Have to, Isabel. We have to find out.

02:30.749 --> 02:33.582
What is this place, Max?

02:38.057 --> 02:39.991
It's where we were all born.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.383
No. No.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.282
No, I-l don't believe this.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.450
Isabel,wait.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.459
We can't leave her alone,
Michael. Come on.

03:22.868 --> 03:26.964
You wanna know, don't you?
You want all the answers.

03:27.039 --> 03:30.031
<i>I can give them to you,
but first you have to convince them...</i>

03:30.109 --> 03:33.477
that I'm not your enemy.

03:41.153 --> 03:43.087
Max didn't tell you
about this, did he?

03:44.657 --> 03:48.355
Take it. It'll prove to them
that I don't want to hurt you.

03:48.427 --> 03:50.896
If you convince them,
then I can explain everything.

04:12.751 --> 04:15.652
How could you
bring them up here like this?

04:15.721 --> 04:20.022
<i>You know the special unit is close.
You saw that camera.</i>

04:20.091 --> 04:22.288
Who do you think put it on them
in the first place?

04:22.361 --> 04:26.195
- Our friend Pierce.
- Yeah. So why don't you just kill him?

04:26.265 --> 04:28.199
According to Max,
you've done that before.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.702
What has he been telling you?

04:30.769 --> 04:33.067
You're gonna trust him over me?

04:33.138 --> 04:36.597
Listen, you and I have spent
a lot of time together.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.235
Now I don't want to say
that we're family-

04:39.311 --> 04:41.405
You're not my family.
You never will be.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.539
Max, Michael and Isabel are.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.278
Fine. Go have your little reunion.

04:48.587 --> 04:52.148
If I have to kill people, I kill people.

04:52.224 --> 04:56.183
Pierce is dangerous. You all still need me
if you expect to survive him.

04:57.963 --> 05:00.022
You're really scared of Pierce,
aren't you?

05:01.567 --> 05:04.628
- More than the others.
- [ Chuckling]

05:06.872 --> 05:11.571
He's smarter. He's closer to the four of you
than anyone's ever been.

05:13.245 --> 05:15.737
That would mean each of us
has this information in some part of us.

05:15.814 --> 05:17.748
We're just not conscious of it.

05:17.816 --> 05:21.980
Or Liz is getting the messages
from somewhere or someone else.

05:22.054 --> 05:26.582
<i>- Nasedo?
- [Tape Rewinding]</i>

05:27.826 --> 05:32.195
- From somewhere or someone else.
- Nasedo?

05:49.181 --> 05:52.151
<i>I') [ Rock ]</i>

06:03.962 --> 06:06.761
<i>g,' [Continues]</i>

06:23.982 --> 06:26.246
<i>tyfffltf]</i>

06:35.894 --> 06:38.261
You knew about this all along?

06:38.330 --> 06:40.560
Liz and I saw Tess
take it from the library.

06:44.136 --> 06:46.901
It's in some kind
of strange language.

06:48.974 --> 06:51.773
Why would you keep something
like this from us?

06:51.844 --> 06:53.903
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:53.979 --> 06:58.109
- This is <i>me.</i>
- <i>[Michael] It'; all ofus.</i>

06:58.183 --> 07:01.346
- How did they know what we would look like?
- Because we were designed.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.685
- That's impossible, Michael. - Whether you
want to face it or not, we weren't born.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.184
We were engineered.

07:10.929 --> 07:15.093
Do you understand what you're saying?
What that means we are?

07:15.167 --> 07:18.569
- I won't believe that.
- I think he's right.

07:18.637 --> 07:21.538
We're paired,just like in the pods-
Max and Tess, me and Michael.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.475
- No, I belong with Liz.
- Not according to this.

07:25.544 --> 07:27.569
<i>All that stuff Tess
was talking about--</i>

07:27.646 --> 07:29.876
<i>signals and destiny--
that's what this is.</i>

07:29.948 --> 07:34.078
- You and me and the baby, that's what this is.
- The what?

07:36.221 --> 07:38.815
<i>Isabel thinks she'; having a kid.</i>

07:40.759 --> 07:45.219
- Yours? Now who's keeping things from who?
- It's not what you think.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.756
We were never really together. It all happened
in those dreams we were having.

07:48.834 --> 07:51.064
- You can't get pregnant from a dream.
- How do you know?

07:51.136 --> 07:52.626
<i>We don? know how we get pregnant.</i>

07:52.704 --> 07:56.231
Something is happening inside my body,
and we don't know what it is.

07:56.308 --> 07:59.403
<i>I'm going to Tess. She's the one person
who can tell us whafs going on here.</i>

07:59.478 --> 08:02.709
<i>No. We can't just go
asking her things.</i>

08:02.781 --> 08:04.943
We can't trust her any more
than we can trust Nasedo.

08:05.017 --> 08:09.511
They may be the only ones
that can help us. Max.

08:12.424 --> 08:16.292
I'll go.
Look at the pictures.

08:16.361 --> 08:18.921
<i>H' she's gonna talk
to anyone, it'll be me.</i>

08:18.997 --> 08:21.796
- You said we can't trust her.
- Who said anything about trusting her?

08:21.867 --> 08:25.531
- What are you saying? - I'm gonna get
her to tell me what's happening to you.

08:39.918 --> 08:42.649
I had a feeling
one of you would come.

08:42.721 --> 08:45.383
I'm glad it was you.

08:45.457 --> 08:48.825
Michael said you wanted us
to trust you, so here I am.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.862
What changed your mind?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.734
I want to know what's in it.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.066
I want to know everything.

08:59.137 --> 09:01.629
Are you sure?

09:03.008 --> 09:07.036
I've thought about it.
I'm ready.

09:09.147 --> 09:11.241
Let's go somewhere.

09:18.056 --> 09:20.650
Here's that file you wanted.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.252
- Anything interesting?
- Checks out, Sheriff.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.729
Edward M. Harding,
civilian consultant.

09:25.797 --> 09:28.027
<i>Transferred here from Fort McClellan,
near Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

09:28.100 --> 09:32.094
<i>Before that, U. S. Army material command
in Alexandria, Virginia.</i>

09:32.170 --> 09:34.332
- Divorced, one child.
- [Knocking]

09:34.406 --> 09:37.376
- Sheriffvalenti?
- Can I help you?

09:37.442 --> 09:40.275
Deputy Fisher.
You requested me.

09:40.345 --> 09:45.146
- <i>Com e again?</i>
- <i>Deputy Dave Fisher. Sent down 290m Santa Fe.</i>

09:45.217 --> 09:47.743
Took me off traffic violations.
Told me you needed more bodies.

09:47.819 --> 09:51.050
I requested an extra man
about six months ago.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.421
They said they didn't have
any money in the budget.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.392
[Chuckles]
I guess they found some.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.929
Listen, Deputy...

09:57.996 --> 10:00.226
I think I've got the traffic around here
pretty much under control...

10:00.299 --> 10:02.393
so why don't you scoot on
back to Santa Fe?

10:02.467 --> 10:06.426
With all due respect, sir,
I do have my orders.

10:06.505 --> 10:10.965
<i>I just put a deposit down on an apartment,
and they've already outfitted me and--</i>

10:11.043 --> 10:13.444
- All right. We'll straighten this out later.
- Thank you

10:13.512 --> 10:16.777
ls there anything I can do
in the meantime to help you?

10:18.483 --> 10:22.317
Yeah. Coffee's been getting
that metallic taste lately.

10:22.387 --> 10:25.357
<i>Maybe you could
wash out the pot.</i>

10:27.726 --> 10:30.127
Yes, sir. Thank you.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.895
<i>Get Santa Fe on the phone.
He'd better be who he says he is.</i>

10:44.042 --> 10:46.841
What if Max doesn't find anything out?
What if it's worse than we thought?

10:46.912 --> 10:50.507
- Let's not go there until we know something.
- Michael, I'm so scared.

10:50.582 --> 10:54.746
- You have Max and you have me.
- I don't even know who you are anymore.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.790
Are you my brother or my mate?

10:59.858 --> 11:01.849
I can't forget that dream.
Can you?

11:01.927 --> 11:06.660
<i>You were so happy, Michael.
I've never seen you that happy.</i>

11:06.732 --> 11:09.201
Well, I've never been
that happy before.

11:14.973 --> 11:19.877
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.880
What is this going to do to everyone else-
you and Maria, me and Alex?

11:22.948 --> 11:25.007
Let's not think about that right now.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.447
I just want you to know that I'm not
going to let you go through this alone.

11:30.522 --> 11:35.221
It's my baby too. Maybe this is the way
things are meant to be, okay?

11:57.015 --> 11:59.450
[Whistling]

12:19.504 --> 12:21.438
I was hoping
it would be one of you.

12:21.506 --> 12:25.170
I need to send a message
to Agent Pierce.

12:39.524 --> 12:44.155
<i>[ Tess ] I know it must have been
a surprise, finding out about me.</i>

12:44.229 --> 12:47.358
We knew there was someone out there,
but we thought it was Nasedo.

12:49.067 --> 12:52.765
- So you do know him.
- He was there when I came out of the pod...

12:52.838 --> 12:54.772
and he's taken care of me ever since.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.810
- So he's our father?
- Not really, Max.

12:57.876 --> 13:00.368
- Then who is he?
- I don't even know.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.914
I've been with him for 1 O years,
but everywhere we go...

13:02.981 --> 13:05.973
- he changes into somebody different.
- Why?

13:06.051 --> 13:08.543
Because we can't get caught.
That's how we've survived.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.884
Why can he shape-shift
and we can't?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.584
Because he doesn't have
a human body like us, Max.

13:13.658 --> 13:16.719
He needs to hide
who he really is.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.729
What does he really look like?

13:18.797 --> 13:22.597
He's never let me see.
He never lets me close to him at all.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.829
- And he's all you've ever had?
- Yeah.

13:24.903 --> 13:27.634
- That must have been hard.
- It's been really lonely.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.403
He doesn't have
a human side at all.

13:32.477 --> 13:35.412
I don't know what it would have been like
for me if I didn't have Michael and Isabel.

13:39.084 --> 13:43.920
But it's okay 'cause I found you.
I mean, all of you.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.584
The pictures in the book,
the four of us-

13:47.659 --> 13:51.687
- What do they mean?
- You know what they mean. You feel it.

13:51.763 --> 13:56.200
I know I'm drawn to you,
but I don't- I don't know you.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.431
But you do because we're the same.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.438
You knew me before you met me.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.874
- What about the dreams?
- You're having dreams?

14:04.943 --> 14:07.105
- Sometimes.
- About you and me?

14:08.680 --> 14:13.083
If we were together in a dream...

14:13.151 --> 14:17.315
does that mean-
is that how we... mate?

14:17.389 --> 14:21.519
[Chuckles]
No. We have to do it the human way.

14:34.472 --> 14:36.531
I hope that doesn't disappoint you.

14:38.076 --> 14:40.010
<i>The dreams are to awaken</i> us...

14:40.078 --> 14:42.843
to show us how it's meant to be.

14:42.914 --> 14:47.249
- Do you understand?
- I thinkl do.

14:57.829 --> 15:01.094
- Liz, let's go.
- Max, what's going on?

15:01.166 --> 15:04.500
I'll tell you later. I'll tell you everything.
We've gotta go now.

15:04.569 --> 15:06.503
Max, I'm just about to start my shift.

15:06.571 --> 15:10.064
This is important.

15:10.141 --> 15:13.907
Okay. I guess I could leave
forjusta little while.

15:13.979 --> 15:17.677
- Let me just go tell Maria.
- No, don't.

15:17.749 --> 15:19.877
I'm tired of reporting to everybody.

15:19.951 --> 15:22.750
It's always been the six of us,
no matter what we do.

15:22.821 --> 15:26.086
This time, I just want it
to be me and you.

15:26.157 --> 15:28.387
We need this, Liz.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.394
Okay.

15:48.946 --> 15:53.042
- I have a lot to think about.
- Take your time. I'm here for you.

15:55.853 --> 15:57.787
<i>[ Liz]
50 what? up with the jeep?</i>

15:57.855 --> 16:01.814
Transmission needed some work,
so they gave me this rental.

16:01.892 --> 16:05.556
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

16:29.253 --> 16:32.223
- So tell me.
- Tell you what?

16:32.289 --> 16:36.317
Tell me everything. Isn't that what
you said you were going to tell me?

16:36.393 --> 16:39.727
I just want you to know that
nobody will ever come between us.

16:39.797 --> 16:42.596
- Nobody.
- Tell me something I don't know.

16:42.666 --> 16:44.600
If you keep that up,
I'm gonna have to pull over.

16:44.668 --> 16:47.763
Is that a threat,
or is that a promise?

17:04.354 --> 17:06.345
What?

17:08.459 --> 17:10.393
Nothing.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.098
Hey. Look, um-

17:22.172 --> 17:25.472
I heard something,
and I gotta ask you about it.

17:25.541 --> 17:28.477
And I hope that the answer
is some alien thing...

17:28.545 --> 17:31.810
'causel can't imagine
any other explanation that you could give-

17:31.882 --> 17:35.375
- What are you talking about?
- The baby, Michael.

17:36.987 --> 17:40.048
- I can't talk about that.
- You owe me an explanation.

17:40.123 --> 17:42.285
It's not what you think.

17:42.359 --> 17:46.125
I thought that you and Isabel
were brother and sister.

17:46.196 --> 17:49.393
- And now suddenly you're sleeping together?
- We're not sleeping together.

17:49.466 --> 17:52.265
- Then how is there a baby?
- I don't know.

17:52.336 --> 17:55.772
- How do you not know?
- I just don't know!

17:55.839 --> 17:59.400
I don't know anything anymore.
I don't know what it means, what I'm feeling-

17:59.476 --> 18:02.741
What you're feeling?
Now you have feelings for her?

18:02.813 --> 18:05.942

- It's not that simple.

18:35.012 --> 18:36.844

- Alex, would you stop?

18:36.914 --> 18:38.848
We're not dealing with some
troubled teen pregnancy, okay?

that things might get weird?

ready for a relationship.

- Working the files, sir.

organizing them, sir. Color-coding them.

- You don't have to prove anything.

“Son, you got nothin' to prove.“

But he was wrong.
