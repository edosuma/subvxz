WEBVTT

00:35.703 --> 00:37.455
Joe killed Georges
and shot Roxy.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.457
- We have to get her
to the hospital!
- Joe! He just fucking...

00:39.457 --> 00:41.500
Wait, wait, if we take her
to a hospital, they're gonna see

00:41.500 --> 00:42.960
- the bullet wound...
- No, she's gonna bleed out

00:42.960 --> 00:44.670
if we don't! We're taking her
to the fucking hospital!

00:44.670 --> 00:46.672
All right, we got to go.

00:46.672 --> 00:47.923
We got to go!

00:47.923 --> 00:49.133
I got you, Roxy.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.015
- Come on... we got to go.
- There's a hospital

00:56.015 --> 00:57.850
- ten miles down the road.
We passed it on the way over.
- Whoa!

00:57.850 --> 00:59.268
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Where are you going?!

00:59.268 --> 01:00.436
To get Clara!

01:00.436 --> 01:03.606
Get in the car!
Lonny, now!

01:03.606 --> 01:04.857
Now!

01:12.364 --> 01:16.035
That's right,
you look at me. You look...

01:16.035 --> 01:17.161
How's she doing?

01:17.161 --> 01:19.330
Not so good.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.917
Just-just keep her
alive, all right?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.668
Keep her alive.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.382
They killed Georges.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.884
- What?
- They-they shot Roxy.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.969
- Georges is dead?
- What?!

02:56.969 --> 02:58.470
- They took Clara.
- Who? Who?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.639
- Joe.
- Joe?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.224
And Travis.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.350
Tr-Travis is...

03:03.350 --> 03:05.060
He's doing life in Poughkeepsie.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.271
Yeah, well, he's here now.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.522
They're all here.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.316
Georges should've been
more careful.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.358
Idiot.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.360
All right.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.445
They have Clara.

03:14.445 --> 03:15.779
All right? The...

03:15.779 --> 03:17.531
the van that they took her in

03:17.531 --> 03:19.867
had its windows covered
with a newspaper.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.995
Uh, <i>Diario Villa Sonora?</i>

03:22.995 --> 03:24.455
It's a local paper.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.206
Villa Sonora is a small village.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.958
It's about an hour away.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.585
Okay. Well, we have to go. Now.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.921
- We're not going anywhere.
- No.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.464
No, no, no.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.299
- We have to go. Come on.
- They are using her as bait!

03:35.299 --> 03:37.134
- I don't care
if they're using her as bait.
- We are not going!

03:37.134 --> 03:39.011
- We have to go. Come on.
- <i>Ima...</i> we must go.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.930
Thirty years. Thirty years I've
been searching for this man.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.932
We are closer now than ever.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.268
Our responsibility is
to the six million,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.938
- not to his shiksa girlfriend!
- I'm not gonna just let them
kill her.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.773
- This is bigger than you, Jonah.
- Family is

03:50.773 --> 03:52.107
more important.
That is what you said.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.943
I am your family!

03:53.943 --> 03:57.237
I am your only family!

04:01.200 --> 04:03.994
You dare speak
of family?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.830
Georges was your family.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.583
<i>Ima,</i> he called you. Mother.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.585
Years he spent by your side.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.546
E-Even after Maz died
and-and Sofi was killed

04:14.546 --> 04:17.633
and Zev left,
Georges stuck by you.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.969
And now he's dead, and you
just... you just brush him away

04:19.969 --> 04:22.429
like he was shit on your shoe.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.356
Your blood may run a little bit
colder than mine, dear <i>Ima,</i>

04:32.356 --> 04:34.984
but one life lost today
is more than enough.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.486
We find the girl first.

04:38.487 --> 04:42.574
Or you can go and hunt Hitler
all on your lonesome.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.210
Cowards.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.506
Cowards, all.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.221
Your <i>safta</i> would be ashamed.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.352
As would your father.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.331
You're scared of me?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.084
You were gonna marry Jonah,
and you're scared of me?

05:40.507 --> 05:43.010
Do you know how many people
he's killed?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.679
He shot them,
slit their throats,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.556
electrocuted 'em?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.768
Hell, I heard he even killed
a little boy,

05:50.768 --> 05:51.894
an innocent child,

05:51.894 --> 05:55.481
just... eight years old.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.862
You, my dear, have been
sharing a bed,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.947
a life

06:03.947 --> 06:07.159
with a cold-blooded murderer.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.827
You never...

06:08.827 --> 06:11.747
felt it?

06:11.747 --> 06:13.248
When he was inside you?

06:23.425 --> 06:25.469
Please...

06:30.099 --> 06:32.601
Who wouldn't
come running for you?

06:37.314 --> 06:39.858
They need you.

07:13.559 --> 07:17.187
You always were a bookworm, huh?

07:17.187 --> 07:20.691
Your-your contacts
surely delivered.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.610
There's mountains of this.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.320
I know
you'll find even more.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.658
Money buys you a lot of things
in this world, Ruth.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.535
Other things.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.412
Where is the...

07:33.412 --> 07:35.706
where's the brilliant matchmaker

07:35.706 --> 07:37.499
Hilda Hoffman sending you now?

07:37.499 --> 07:40.669
To find a man she says

07:40.669 --> 07:43.297
could be the key to our success.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.716
Her finest recruit yet,
she says.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.510
A man who has quietly

07:48.510 --> 07:52.222
wiped dozens of Nazis in Europe
from this Earth.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.267
Hilda has no photos of him.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.727
No records.

07:56.727 --> 08:00.731
Just a name, Tomas Arndt.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.108
He's in Germany, so...

08:04.359 --> 08:05.444
Germany?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.449
I'll be back, end of the week.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.118
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable, Ruth?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.828
Take your shoes off.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.246
Make yourself at home.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.917
But this is not my home, Meyer.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.462
I would not mistake it as such,

08:23.462 --> 08:26.840
and you should not mistake me.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.015
You travel safe.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.489
No, no, no, you will be okay.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.366
Lonny,
I can't keep her awake.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.618
I'm-I'm going as fast as I can!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.289
<i>The guards turn shifts
at 2:00 a.m.</i>

08:59.289 --> 09:00.916
Carl, Eddie, Learah,

09:00.916 --> 09:03.710
you need to be at the southwest
gate at five minutes till.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.587
<i>Any longer, and the guards
will get suspicious,</i>

09:05.587 --> 09:07.005
<i>you understand?</i>

09:07.005 --> 09:09.508
That's when I'll head
to Imani's cell,

09:09.508 --> 09:12.302
pick the lock, and usher her out
through the north gate.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.805
AJ, you'll be there
with the van at 2:21.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.016
You don't idle, you don't stop.
You understand?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.893
This has to be perfect,

09:19.893 --> 09:23.146
<i>- like clockwork.
-</i>

09:23.146 --> 09:24.314
<i>And then we drive as far</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:26.108
<i>north as we can.</i>

09:26.108 --> 09:27.526
<i>Hmm?</i>

09:29.111 --> 09:32.072
They locked
an innocent woman up,

09:32.072 --> 09:35.826
and I won't let my sister die
in that jail cell.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.036
Help!

09:38.036 --> 09:39.538
Help, please!

09:39.538 --> 09:41.456
Somebody! <i>¡Ayúdame!</i>

10:24.207 --> 10:26.001
Why is it so quiet?

10:26.001 --> 10:28.253
I don't know.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.174
It's Sunday. They're at church.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.092
Do you remember anything more?

10:34.092 --> 10:39.014
Uh, dark gray van.
Dodge Ram. No license plate.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.432
Ask around
about the car.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.392
See if anyone knows anything.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.062
Millie and I will take
the western edge.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.190
They're not fond of outsiders
here. You must be careful.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.775
We'll be fine.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.961
What is it?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.759
I did something.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.261
What are you talking about?

11:19.971 --> 11:22.641
Before we came here,

11:22.641 --> 11:26.144
I, uh...

11:26.144 --> 11:28.688
There was this b...

11:28.688 --> 11:32.275
There was this bishop
we were prosecuting.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.569
He collaborated
with the Nazis in Lithuania.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.779
And he got off?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.490
We didn't even go to trial.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.785
And you couldn't let that stand.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.245
And they know I did it.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.996
- Oh, no, Millie...
- They know.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.208
And it's just a matter of time
before they find me.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.876
- So I need to go.
- No.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.837
- I need to go.
I need to disappear.
- No, you can't, no.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.922
No. I know what it is
to disappear.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.634
I know what it is to spend
one's whole life running.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.344
But I can assure you
that running forever

11:59.344 --> 12:01.596
gets you absolutely nowhere.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.605
Was it wrong?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.983
Oh... no.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.278
You did God's work.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.071
And that's
the thing. I don't...

12:18.071 --> 12:22.033
I've been feeling
in my heart like I didn't,

12:22.033 --> 12:23.493
like I failed His test.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.496
- He was a bishop...
- No. He wore a hat and a robe.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.040
A costume, but he was no bishop.
He was a Nazi.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.254
Listen to me.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.508
You... you think
what you did was a sin?

12:39.968 --> 12:43.180
What you did was a blessing.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.600
You did it for my father.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.645
You did it for me.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.526
Millie, you are not
going to hell.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.236
- Harriet...
- You are not

12:58.236 --> 13:00.322
going to hell.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.826
One great deed

13:04.826 --> 13:06.578
can outweigh it all.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.623
Can purge every sin.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.375
One great deed.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.634
Finding Hitler?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.264
You are not going to hell,

13:26.264 --> 13:27.891
and you are not going to jail.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.810
You are not going anywhere
but with me.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.691
You understand?

14:04.553 --> 14:06.555
Auf Wiedersehen.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.729
- Ah.
- Hello.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.273
<i>Hallo.</i>

14:16.273 --> 14:19.734
I am looking for Tomas Arndt.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.528
Yeah?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.946
- Tomas...
- Yes.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.739
...is visiting his parents
in Hungary.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.159
- He'll be back on Friday.
- Ah. Oh.

14:28.159 --> 14:31.079
Can I help with something?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.747
Do you want to leave a message?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.624
Oh. No, thank you.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.418
- I'm an old friend.
- Mm.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.461
I'll-I'll stop by
on Friday, then.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.463
- Very good.
- Thanks.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.467
<i>Pull!</i>

14:48.054 --> 14:49.806
Pull.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.146
Are you out of your mind?

14:57.814 --> 14:59.274
Is that a question?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.693
You think you're
going to fly over

15:01.693 --> 15:03.445
Washington or London or Moscow

15:03.445 --> 15:05.572
and drop a nuclear weapon?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.616
Would you prefer to stay here
and look out at the dirt

15:07.616 --> 15:10.702
and rocks every day...

15:10.702 --> 15:16.041
...until we slowly wither
and die?

15:16.041 --> 15:18.877
Perhaps death will come sooner
than that.

15:22.380 --> 15:27.177
You failed in America, <i>darling.</i>

15:27.177 --> 15:35.185
I gave you every opportunity
and untold millions.

15:35.185 --> 15:40.940
You were brought
to your knees...

15:40.940 --> 15:46.279
...and not in the way you became
famous for during the war.

15:46.279 --> 15:51.826
And now your little Jews
are here...

15:51.826 --> 15:55.997
...and our little toys must
clean up your mess.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.457
You bomb one of those cities,

15:57.457 --> 16:00.085
and they will do everything
in their power to find us

16:00.085 --> 16:02.921
and annihilate us before
we even have another chance.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.093
Eva...

16:10.136 --> 16:17.686
...I killed more people
in six years and one day...

16:17.686 --> 16:23.608
...than Genghis Khan killed
in 200 years.

16:23.608 --> 16:29.614
And they lifted not a finger
to find me.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.911
I will get the bomb, my dear.

16:34.911 --> 16:42.168
And then you watch and learn
what one does with real power.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.421
Says the man in a safari suit

16:44.421 --> 16:47.424
shooting aimlessly
at clay pigeons

16:47.424 --> 16:50.885
in a dusty wasteland
surrounded by dirt

16:50.885 --> 16:52.887
and shit.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.978
I don't have anything
to do with this.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.065
Whatever Sam is doing...

17:04.065 --> 17:06.901
Jonah, whatever his name is.

17:10.989 --> 17:14.451
Please. Please.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.453
My parents have money.

17:20.832 --> 17:21.875
I could...

17:21.875 --> 17:23.710
<i>They-they could...</i>

17:26.796 --> 17:28.631
...wire you
a lot of money

17:28.631 --> 17:32.177
- if-if you just let me go.
- I don't care about money.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.262
- What do you care about?
- Stop.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.139
Can't.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.640
Can't stop talking
when I'm nervous,

17:37.640 --> 17:39.976
and I'm fucking scared to death.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.149
Are you going to kill me?

17:59.370 --> 18:02.373
My name is Clara.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.668
I'm from outside Crowsborough,
near London.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.339
Hop and a skip, really.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.634
And I'm a student.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.222
And I'm scared right now.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.687
Who are you?

18:25.688 --> 18:28.483
Where are you from?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.818
Just...

18:31.528 --> 18:33.071
Just talk to me.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.576
What's your name?

18:38.576 --> 18:41.079
Stop talking.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.999
What's your name?

18:48.044 --> 18:51.673
Stop talking.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.469
She could already be dead,
you know that.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.805
I don't know that.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.557
We're wasting our time here.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.232
We scour the town before we go.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.609
- And if we don't find the van?
- Well, we will.

19:13.361 --> 19:17.323
I would say, "Love makes us
do treacherous things."

19:17.323 --> 19:20.034
Mwah. But this isn't love.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.036
You don't
actually love her.

19:22.036 --> 19:25.665
What the hell
do you know about love?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.543
You think love is sharing
a life with someone.

19:28.543 --> 19:32.755
Hanging on to them,
no matter what comes your way.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.382
No, <i>kindeleh.</i>

19:34.382 --> 19:37.218
Real love is being without them

19:37.218 --> 19:40.680
to protect them.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.517
I came to Argentina
with the love of my life.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.895
And when Zev put me
before the mission,

19:46.895 --> 19:49.522
before finding Hitler,
I ended it

19:49.522 --> 19:51.816
because I knew he
would risk his life for me,

19:51.816 --> 19:53.902
and I couldn't have that.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.446
It was like chopping off a limb.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.824
If you loved her,
truly loved her,

19:59.824 --> 20:01.826
you would have ended it

20:01.826 --> 20:06.164
because we both know that
the greatest threat to Clara

20:06.164 --> 20:07.832
is you.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.127
Nothing.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.463
We should go.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.261
Wait, there...
there was a flower.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.014
Travis tossed it from the van.
I thought it was a taunt.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.183
Might've been a clue.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.648
Hey, good afternoon! Welcome.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.069
How can I help you?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.237
He's getting flowers
for his girlfriend.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
- Ah.
- But... mm...

20:41.407 --> 20:42.700
Do you have a van?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.791
Excuse me?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.376
Do you have a van?

20:52.126 --> 20:52.961
No.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.756
How do you make deliveries?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.424
On my bicycle.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.301
On your bicycle.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.637
It's a small town.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.680
Mm.

21:08.184 --> 21:08.977
Excuse me.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.104
Jonah, what'd the flower
look like?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.271
It was purple.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.399
Purple.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.908
Jonah.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.243
This?

21:26.494 --> 21:27.453
Yeah, that's it.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.455
Who brings you these flowers?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.832
- Uh...
- Answer the question.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.379
They're from
a small flower farm.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.172
Los Olmos.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.049
Where's the farm?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.386
Tell me now. Now!

21:44.929 --> 21:46.764
Ojo de Agua Road.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.310
He's just scared.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.192
<i>Gracias.</i>

22:29.223 --> 22:31.059
Welcome to Zuch's, sir.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.269
Can I get you anything?

22:33.269 --> 22:34.353
Ah.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.563
The weisswurst is fresh.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.106
- No.
- We're doing pork necks.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.566
- Three for a Deutschmark.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.860
- I was just looking.
- Ah.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.821
- You are a tourist?
- Well, I am,

22:43.821 --> 22:46.032
uh, from America, so...

22:46.032 --> 22:47.658
I like your hat.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.162
My hat? What hat?

22:52.163 --> 22:53.706
- Thank you.
- Mm.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.708
Ah.

22:58.503 --> 22:59.670
Come here.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.465
- Oh, what?
- Come on. I won't bite.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.175
Oh, please.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.469
Oh, no.
I-I don't want any. No...

23:06.469 --> 23:09.931
Go on. You'll fall in love.
I promise.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.100
Well, then I have to.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.436
Mmm.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.897
It is good.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.817
- I'll take a pint, uh, please.
- Of course.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.736
So, how long have you
worked here?

23:23.736 --> 23:27.824
Hmm, about... 20 years?

23:27.824 --> 23:30.493
- Oh, please. No.
- Mm-hmm.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.411
- You're joking.
- No. I was five

23:32.411 --> 23:35.248
when my mother let me sweep
the scraps from the floor,

23:35.248 --> 23:38.209
ten when I started
at the register,

23:38.209 --> 23:41.420
and just last week
I became a manager.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.632
It's been in the family
for two generations.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.759
Anja, enough chatting.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.928
The freezer needs cleaning.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.179
Of course, Mom.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.265
You should've done this already.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.438
She's lovely, your daughter.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.982
Thank you.

24:00.982 --> 24:04.527
So, the... the goulash, that is
all you're taking with you?

24:04.527 --> 24:06.654
What? Uh...

24:06.654 --> 24:09.073
No.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.366
Uh...

24:10.366 --> 24:12.785
Sir?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.872
Sir,

24:15.872 --> 24:18.749
I don't have all day.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.878
I'll take half dozen, uh, ribs.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.338
This is pork.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.549
- It's pork? Well, I'll try it.
- Yeah.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.802
Yeah? It's good? Okay.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.056
It's a beautiful shop
you have here.

24:34.056 --> 24:37.602
Oh, thank you. Yeah,
my parents built it, and then,

24:37.602 --> 24:40.730
when they died, I took it over.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.107
- Yeah?
- Ah.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.153
- I'm sorry about your parents.
- Oh.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.739
It was long time ago.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.450
In the war?

24:52.450 --> 24:53.993
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.495
My father,
it was a heart attack,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.581
and my mother

24:58.581 --> 25:00.166
from a broken heart.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.585
Oh. Well...

25:02.585 --> 25:04.795
That does usually happen

25:04.795 --> 25:08.090
when the two people have been
together and one dies.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.926
No, no, no. No, it wasn't
from the death of my father.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.011
It was from the death
of my brother.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.222
He was older than me,

25:14.222 --> 25:16.349
and I idolized him.

25:17.934 --> 25:20.019
Until I learned what he became.

25:23.648 --> 25:26.692
So it's, um...

25:26.692 --> 25:29.737
- Ah. The goulash.
- Yes.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.031
Yeah. So...

25:32.031 --> 25:33.699
Ten marks, please. Deutschmarks.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.867
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.286
Yeah, danke.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.542
Well, thank you.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.836
It's very good to have met you.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.968
Sorry if I was
a little in-intrusive.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.261
No, no.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.356
<i>You're from
America, right?</i>

26:05.356 --> 26:08.067
I always wanted to go there.

26:08.067 --> 26:11.070
Maybe California.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.698
Maybe try surfing.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.992
Have you surfed?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.831
I don't know why I think
every American surfs.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.628
I...

26:27.628 --> 26:30.506
- I live near the desert.
- Wow.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.049
There's a desert?

26:32.049 --> 26:34.593
Didn't know that.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.887
I grew up the complete opposite.

26:36.887 --> 26:40.349
It rains every day
where I'm from.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.060
What do you do in-in the desert?

26:43.060 --> 26:46.689
Your-your parents have
a swimming pool or something?

26:48.566 --> 26:50.192
I had a dirt bike.

26:50.192 --> 26:54.655
How did you get from the desert

26:54.655 --> 26:56.782
to... this?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.243
It's what I'm supposed to do.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.579
You're supposed
to kidnap me?

27:03.748 --> 27:05.166
Kill me?

27:07.209 --> 27:08.669
Why?

27:10.463 --> 27:12.381
I didn't do anything.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.762
You're no Nazi.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.764
You must know that.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.891
You-You've got to know that.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.559
You can remember.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.728
You can tell your brain
to remember.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.271
- No. Wait, please. Can I...
- No.

27:27.271 --> 27:30.441
Can I just have
some water first?

27:30.441 --> 27:31.734
Please.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.700
Thank you. Thank you. I...

27:39.700 --> 27:42.119
I am so, so

27:42.119 --> 27:44.121
very grateful for you.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.250
Mmm.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.668
Thank you.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.443
No.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.529
No! No!

28:23.369 --> 28:25.371
No. No. Please. No.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.332
What
happened to her?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.501
There was a car accident.
Some shrapnel impaled her.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.503
- Shrapnel?
- Yeah.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.504
We heard about
a shooting at the Palladio.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.797
It was a car accident.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.424
- I told you.
- She needs blood.

28:36.424 --> 28:39.218
- Get her blood!
- She's lost
a lot of blood.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.719
We have to operate right now.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.388
<i>You want to be a hero?</i>

28:43.389 --> 28:44.849
Be a mother.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.794
Do you have something to say?

29:15.880 --> 29:17.089
Do you?

29:19.091 --> 29:22.511
How about, "Thank you, Dad,
for saving my ass

29:22.511 --> 29:24.555
- again"?
- So, you're okay

29:24.555 --> 29:26.348
with your innocent daughter
being held

29:26.348 --> 29:28.267
- on trumped-up charges in jail?
- No, but I'm

29:28.267 --> 29:30.978
certainly not okay with my
other daughter joining her.

29:30.978 --> 29:34.273
Not when she's got a baby girl
at home who needs her.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.984
Do you know how selfish that is?

29:36.984 --> 29:38.652
Selfish?

29:38.652 --> 29:41.614
I'm doing everything I can to
get my big sister out of prison.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.909
I'm putting everything
on the line for Imani.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.327
What are you doing, Daddy?

29:46.327 --> 29:48.496
What... What...

29:48.496 --> 29:51.874
I'm mortgaging the house
and hiring lawyers.

29:51.874 --> 29:54.710
I'm filing
habeas corpus petitions.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.296
I'm involving the courts,
enlisting the press.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.966
I'm doing it the right way,
the legal way.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.136
Well, even if you do
all of that, it won't help.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.473
There is nothing right
or legal or fair

30:07.473 --> 30:09.016
about what happened
to Imani, Daddy.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.143
You don't think I know that?

30:11.143 --> 30:15.022
Do you know how many times
I've been arrested for protests

30:15.022 --> 30:16.649
and sit-ins and

30:16.649 --> 30:19.068
languished in a cell and bled

30:19.068 --> 30:22.112
and cried and lost

30:22.112 --> 30:24.281
so you wouldn't have to?

30:24.281 --> 30:28.118
So that my two little girls
could have a life

30:28.118 --> 30:30.579
where they could see the sun,

30:30.579 --> 30:32.957
where they could smile
and be free

30:32.957 --> 30:34.375
and have joy

30:34.375 --> 30:36.669
and become anything they wanted
in the whole world.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.170
And now you want to play

30:38.170 --> 30:41.131
like you're BLA?
Oh, geez.

30:41.131 --> 30:44.552
Thank God you were smart enough
not to carry weapons on you.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.845
I'm just trying
to do right, Daddy.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.896
You always have.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.484
Since you were a little girl.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.364
Every cause became yours.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.369
And Malika is my greatest cause.

31:13.664 --> 31:16.000
I'm just trying to make
the world better for her.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.587
See, that's the thing, sweetheart.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.088
You are her world.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.965
And when you try
and save the world,

31:22.965 --> 31:25.092
<i>you're putting her world
at risk.</i>

31:25.092 --> 31:27.094
<i>Listen, your friend
has a serious wound.</i>

31:27.094 --> 31:29.930
<i>Her artery could burst.
This isn't an operating room.</i>

31:29.930 --> 31:32.474
- Make do.
- I only have
local anesthetic...

31:32.474 --> 31:33.601
Make fucking do.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.646
You want to be a hero?

31:37.646 --> 31:38.939
Be a mother.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.109
<i>Give her joy.</i>

31:42.109 --> 31:46.572
<i>Give her a future.
Be there for her.</i>

31:46.572 --> 31:48.782
Because if she loses you...

31:48.782 --> 31:50.242
She has a daughter.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.077
<i>Okay? A little girl.</i>

31:52.077 --> 31:53.912
<i>Where were you
last night?</i>

31:53.912 --> 31:56.248
<i>I was out.</i>

31:56.248 --> 31:57.916
If she loses you...

31:57.916 --> 31:59.752
She won't lose me.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.128
Saving the world?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.215
Yeah.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.177
But I will always come home.

32:08.177 --> 32:10.304
You know that, right?

32:10.304 --> 32:12.181
I will always come home.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.352
One day you'll see,

32:16.352 --> 32:19.855
<i>and when you do,</i>

32:19.855 --> 32:21.940
<i>I fear it'll be too late.</i>

32:43.629 --> 32:46.382
Mother.

32:53.347 --> 32:58.310
I thought it was you. When I
saw her in our shop...

32:59.728 --> 33:03.232
I thought I had traveled
back in time.

33:04.066 --> 33:09.071
She looks just like you, Mother.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.827
An odd place to come.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.081
Tomas.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.792
You are as good
as Hilda said you are.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.671
I must say, you're a ghost
for-for real.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.256
Takes one to see one.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.343
So...

33:31.343 --> 33:34.179
how about it?
We-We're putting, uh,

33:34.179 --> 33:37.099
together a small group
in New York City to hunt

33:37.099 --> 33:38.726
down escaped Nazis,

33:38.726 --> 33:41.687
bring 'em to... to justice.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.897
Is that right?

33:43.897 --> 33:46.859
What, you think I'd fly
eight hours in the sky

33:46.859 --> 33:48.819
to jest with you?

33:48.819 --> 33:51.905
And who will bring
you in, Meyer?

33:51.905 --> 33:54.408
I beg your pardon?

33:54.408 --> 33:57.244
You come to Germany,

33:57.244 --> 33:58.787
all this way,

33:58.787 --> 34:02.166
and you visit the gravestone

34:02.166 --> 34:05.252
of the parents
of one Wilhelm Zuchs.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.257
A man who destroyed your world.

34:11.633 --> 34:13.594
Yes, so? What?

34:13.594 --> 34:16.597
- What?
- We put stones.

34:18.807 --> 34:22.728
Jews put stones on graves,

34:22.728 --> 34:24.438
not flowers.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.774
- I was thinking the...
- Stones...

34:26.774 --> 34:29.234
do not die.
Stones do not wither.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.863
Stones are permanent,
like memories.

34:32.863 --> 34:36.658
Like the memory of everyone
that you murdered, Wilhelm.

34:43.624 --> 34:46.418
You think I don't know that?

34:54.218 --> 34:56.637
If only you weren't so good.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.682
Some ghosts

35:00.682 --> 35:03.602
need to stay hidden.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.488
Look away.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.410
Forgive me, Mother.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.096
No, no, please, no.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.640
No, no, no,
please, no!

36:23.640 --> 36:24.766
Hey.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.436
- What?
- Erik saw a car approaching.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.521
It's time.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.945
Okay.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.489
Let's go in.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.746
It's showtime.

40:39.146 --> 40:41.148
Now.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.700
- We got to go!
- No!

40:55.745 --> 40:57.455
It's a fucking ambush!

41:16.933 --> 41:18.393
Fuck...

41:25.859 --> 41:27.277
Fucker!

41:53.011 --> 41:54.721
Millie!

41:59.893 --> 42:01.519
Go!

42:12.197 --> 42:14.532
Aah!

42:15.909 --> 42:17.577
I'm going up.

42:29.339 --> 42:32.676
Get up. Move over there, go!

42:50.110 --> 42:50.944
I've got him!

43:10.130 --> 43:12.215
Hey, Jonah.

43:14.426 --> 43:17.137
Coming out!

43:19.347 --> 43:21.349
Now, I will fucking kill her,

43:21.349 --> 43:24.185
unless you put
your guns down, huh?

43:26.771 --> 43:28.398
Huh?

43:29.774 --> 43:31.443
I'm not lowering my gun.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.278
Hi, Jonah.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.488
Lower your fucking weapon, huh?

43:35.488 --> 43:37.449
We're leaving,

43:37.449 --> 43:39.743
or she dies.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.456
Clara. Clara,
it's gonna be okay.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.833
Okay? Take me.

43:46.833 --> 43:49.294
You wanted me? Take me.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.962
- I have a shot.
- Don't-don't fucking shoot.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.881
- Harriet.
- However, I have Joe. Take him.

43:52.881 --> 43:55.300
- Do not shoot.
- I am gonna fucking kill her!

43:55.300 --> 43:57.302
Do not shoot!

43:57.302 --> 43:59.095
- I have a fucking shot.
- Step the fuck back!

43:59.095 --> 44:01.639
- Take him out!
- Do not!

44:01.639 --> 44:03.016
You wanted me? Take me.

44:03.016 --> 44:04.476
Take him!

44:04.476 --> 44:06.644
Step the fuck back!

44:09.981 --> 44:12.025
- Jonah!
- Don't fucking shoot!

44:23.578 --> 44:25.497
Don't fucking shoot!

44:28.792 --> 44:30.752
Put it down!
Put it down!

44:30.752 --> 44:33.421
Put it down! Don't move!
Don't you fucking move!

44:33.421 --> 44:35.465
- Down, down, down.
- Clara, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

44:35.465 --> 44:37.884
No, get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

44:37.884 --> 44:40.303
But-but wait-wait-wait, wait.

44:40.303 --> 44:42.764
Is anyone else here?

44:42.764 --> 44:45.350
No.

44:50.063 --> 44:52.607
You fucking shot Roxy.

44:53.650 --> 44:55.902
Is she dead?

44:55.902 --> 44:57.946
Maybe.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.991
What happened to you?

45:04.077 --> 45:05.495
I...

45:08.998 --> 45:10.917
I don't know.

45:14.963 --> 45:16.381
Get up.

45:19.134 --> 45:20.385
Stand up.

45:24.639 --> 45:25.765
Harriet.

45:25.765 --> 45:27.559
What?

45:29.436 --> 45:31.938
I know where Hitler is.

45:31.938 --> 45:34.399
I can take you to him.
