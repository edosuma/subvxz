HOLY OVERBITES!

19:09.815 --> 19:11.850
AND I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.753
I'M NOT
YOUR GOLDEN GIRL ANYMORE.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.855
I'M THE HAIR RAZOR!

19:16.922 --> 19:19.157
EXTRA HOLD POWERS, GO!

19:24.096 --> 19:25.731
[screaming]

19:25.797 --> 19:29.368
I'VE STOLEN ALL OF CHINCINATTI'S
HAIR CARE PRODUCTS AND STYLISTS.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.004
YOU WILL ALL WAKE UP
TO UNMANAGEABLE HAIR

19:32.070 --> 19:33.038
<i>AND SPLIT ENDS.</i>

19:33.105 --> 19:34.039
[all gasp]

19:34.106 --> 19:35.140

19:36.341 --> 19:37.109
shink!

19:38.410 --> 19:40.345
shink!

19:40.412 --> 19:42.581
WE'RE ALL
GONNA LOOK LIKE FREAKSSS!

19:42.648 --> 19:46.151
RELEASE THOSE SHAMPOOS, GELS,
AND FLAMBOYANT STYLISTS,

19:46.218 --> 19:49.955
OR I'LL WASH, RINSE,
AND REPEAT WITH JUSTICE!

19:50.022 --> 19:51.790
NEVER!

19:51.857 --> 19:54.626
NOW TASTE MY HAIRPINS OF DOOM!

20:01.833 --> 20:02.301
snip! snip! snip!

20:02.367 --> 20:04.202
buzz!

20:04.269 --> 20:05.337
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE GOLDIE.

20:05.404 --> 20:08.740
BREAK FREE OF THIS EVIL FACADE
AND BE MINE.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.210
SORRY, CRIMSON CHUMP,

20:12.277 --> 20:16.048
BUT HER GOLDEN HEART
IS UNDER MY LOCK AND KEY.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.385
THEN I'LL BREAK HER FREE.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.089
buzz!

20:24.156 --> 20:26.024
OH, BY THE WAY,

20:26.091 --> 20:28.193
I ALWAYS HATED
YOUR CHINNY-CHIN-CHIN.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.030
crash!

20:35.167 --> 20:36.802
CHIN, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:36.868 --> 20:38.370
SHE DIDN'T EVEN HIT YOU!

20:38.437 --> 20:41.206
NO, BUT SHE'S BROKEN MY HEART.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.409
I CAN'T GO ON, CLEFT.
I SURRENDER.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.147
YES, I WILL RULE CHINCINATTI.

20:49.214 --> 20:53.986
I LOVE BEING EVIL!

20:54.052 --> 20:54.553

{\an5}zap!

20:55.520 --> 20:57.289
zap!

20:57.356 --> 21:00.692
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER MESSED
WITH CHIN'S HEART AND TRUE LOVE.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.127
AND?

21:02.194 --> 21:04.963
AND I'M A SELFISH,
COMIC-BOOK-ACTION-LOVING JERK,

21:05.030 --> 21:06.398
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

21:06.465 --> 21:09.868
I WISH THE HAIR RAZOR
WAS GOLDEN LOCKS AGAIN.

21:09.935 --> 21:10.836
splat!

21:10.902 --> 21:12.037
OH, WHAT NOW?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.941
SHE'S TRULY IN LOVE
WITH HER EVIL SELF.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.909
THAT'S THE GREATEST LOVE
OF ALL.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.311
<i>(Timmy)</i>
<i>BUT THE HAIR RAZOR SAID</i>

21:19.378 --> 21:20.912
<i>SHE HAD GOLDIE'S GOLDEN HEART</i>
<i>LOCKED UP.</i>

21:20.979 --> 21:22.681
SO WE'LL UNLOCK IT.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.715
WITH WHAT?

21:23.782 --> 21:25.283
THE POWER OF LOVE.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.252
{\an1}CHIN,
THROW ME OFF THE BUILDING.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.222
AND NO MATTER WHAT I SAY,
NONE OF YOU ARE TO SAVE ME.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.191
{\an1}CHIN, I KNOW THIS GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

21:33.258 --> 21:34.726
BUT YOU HAVE TO THROW ME OFF--

21:34.793 --> 21:36.194
{\an5}thwomp!

21:34.793 --> 21:36.194
[screaming]

21:36.261 --> 21:37.863
I CHANGED MY MIND.

21:37.929 --> 21:41.433
WANDA, PARACHUTE NOW!

21:41.500 --> 21:44.002
{\an3}NO, NO,
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.471
GOLDEN LOCKS, HELP!

21:46.538 --> 21:49.307
YOU SAID YOUR HEART OF GOLD BEAT
FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN!

21:49.374 --> 21:49.975
WELL, CHECK IT OUT!

21:50.042 --> 21:52.411
KID NOT SAFE HERE!

21:52.477 --> 21:54.780
THE HAIR RAZOR'S HEART
IS STONE-COLD

21:54.846 --> 21:57.716
AND DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PUNKS
PLUMMETING TO THEIR DOOM.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.284
SAVE ME, PLEASE!

21:59.351 --> 22:01.253
I'M A KID IN DANGER!

22:01.319 --> 22:03.488
NO, I WILL NEVER!

22:03.555 --> 22:04.923
[screaming]

22:04.990 --> 22:08.927
I'LL SAVE THAT FALLING CHILD!

22:08.994 --> 22:09.861
[screaming]

22:12.864 --> 22:16.034
NICE CATCH,
AND SPEAKING OF NICE CATCHES,

22:16.101 --> 22:17.502
HERE COMES THE CHIN.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.305
OH, CHINNY,

22:20.372 --> 22:22.808
DEEP IN MY HEART, YOUR CHIN
HAD LEFT A PERMANENT MARK.

22:22.874 --> 22:25.510
LET'S NEVER FIGHT AGAIN.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.079
(all)
AWW.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.981
{\an3}YOU OKAY WITH
THIS LOVEY-DOVEY STUFF, SPORT?

22:30.048 --> 22:32.617
IF THE CHIN'S HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.787
GOLDIE, WON'T YOU
BE MINE FOREVER?

22:35.854 --> 22:37.322
ARE YOU NUTS?

22:37.389 --> 22:39.458
I COULD NEVER MARRY A GUY
WHO THROWS KIDS OFF BUILDINGS.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.827
{\an1}BUT WE
CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.296
GOLDEN LOCKS AWAY!

22:44.763 --> 22:48.800
IT HURTS SO BAD!

22:48.867 --> 22:51.403
[bawling]

22:51.470 --> 22:54.740
I GUESS IT'S BACK
TO THE PERSONAL ADS.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.877
SO WHO ANSWERED THE AD
THIS TIME?

22:58.944 --> 23:02.514
TODAY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE
BRONZE AND THE BEAUTIFUL 136.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.249
[door opens]

23:05.550 --> 23:06.885
[gasps]

23:06.952 --> 23:08.420
{\an1}OKAY,
YOU'RE ME AGAIN, BYE!

23:08.487 --> 23:09.488
{\an3}crash!

23:09.554 --> 23:11.723
{\an1}AND NOW YOU'RE HIM,
BYE.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.292
EH, WORKS FOR ME.
