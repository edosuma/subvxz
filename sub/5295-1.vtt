00:47.663 --> 00:49.961
# Young love, teacher's pet

00:50.958 --> 00:53.427
# Cheeks flushed, apple red

00:54.169 --> 00:56.342
# Ringing you every day

00:57.422 --> 01:00.050
# Begging for a word of praise

01:00.259 --> 01:03.229
# I have put aside my foolish games

01:03.887 --> 01:06.265
# I run and hide and call names

01:07.015 --> 01:09.313
# School's out, the bells will ring

01:10.477 --> 01:13.401
# Now's the time to teach me everything

01:13.401 --> 01:16.575
# Teacher, teacher, teach me love

01:16.575 --> 01:19.824
# I can't learn it fast enough

01:19.824 --> 01:23.077
# Teacher, teacher, teach me more

01:23.077 --> 01:26.205
# I have got to learn to love for sure

01:26.205 --> 01:29.250
# Lesson one just begun

01:29.250 --> 01:32.333
# Growing up ain't much fun

01:33.166 --> 01:36.010
# Growing up, out of school

01:36.420 --> 01:39.014
# Out of luck and out of rules

01:40.007 --> 01:42.009
# No one there to tell me how

01:42.676 --> 01:45.976
# A different world, teacher, teach me now

01:45.976 --> 01:49.149
# Teacher, teacher, teach me love

01:49.149 --> 01:51.443
# I can't learn it fast enough

01:52.185 --> 01:55.485
# Teacher, teacher, teach me more

01:55.485 --> 01:58.943
# I have got to learn to love for sure

01:58.943 --> 02:02.246
# Teacher, teacher, teach me love

02:02.246 --> 02:05.450
# I can't learn it fast enough

02:05.450 --> 02:07.451
# Teacher, teacher, teach me love... #

02:07.451 --> 02:09.829
All right, folks.
Can we all settle down for a sec?

02:10.537 --> 02:12.005
I know that you...

02:12.005 --> 02:13.627
- Hey, you settle down.
- No.

02:13.627 --> 02:16.335
Come on, everybody,
settle down. Sandy, come on.

02:16.335 --> 02:17.670
So... No, none of that.

02:17.670 --> 02:21.553
This is not a time to make silly jokes.
It's the time for a little bit of talking

02:21.553 --> 02:23.509
before we really get
to the important part.

02:23.509 --> 02:26.220
Here we go. Well, it's been
another great year here at JAMS.

02:27.054 --> 02:29.227
Who can forget
Mr. Pinkus' Haunted Classroom?

02:29.227 --> 02:32.227
Thank you, Sandy, for that.
Yeah, I ain't afraid of no ghost.

02:34.144 --> 02:37.569
Or the wild success of the book
drive for the women's prison,

02:37.569 --> 02:40.317
which Miss Pavicic's class sponsored?

02:40.942 --> 02:44.162
Thank you, Beth.
But, as summer draws upon us,

02:44.162 --> 02:47.081
it's time not only to say
goodbye to another school year,

02:47.081 --> 02:50.127
but, sadly, also to say goodbye
to one of our faculty members.

02:50.127 --> 02:52.455
Yes. Elizabeth?

02:53.205 --> 02:55.253
Is Elizabeth Halsey here?
There she is.

02:55.253 --> 02:56.504
Elizabeth, can you
come on up here?

02:57.751 --> 03:01.005
Yes, that's appropriate,
applause, I think.

03:01.672 --> 03:06.178
Elizabeth, even though you were
only with us for one short year,

03:07.135 --> 03:11.265
please know that we will always
consider you part of the JAMS family.

03:11.265 --> 03:13.726
That's sweet.
And we got you a little something.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.893
Ta-da.
Oh.

03:15.435 --> 03:16.482
Thank you.

03:16.482 --> 03:17.604
Wow.

03:18.855 --> 03:20.732
Almost $40.

03:21.108 --> 03:23.361
Thank you.
You're very welcome. Speech.

03:23.361 --> 03:28.449
Okay, well, I am really terrible at these
types of things, so I will make it quick.

03:29.116 --> 03:33.212
I know I have only been here a year,
but there's so much I will miss.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.879
My students probably most.

03:41.378 --> 03:43.927
And I wish that I had gotten
to know all of you better.

03:49.136 --> 03:50.513
Happy birthday.

03:50.513 --> 03:54.850
But between four classes and planning
a wedding, my plate was full.

03:55.225 --> 03:57.648
Still, I know our
students are in good hands.

03:59.896 --> 04:03.150
And even though I will never
teach again professionally,

04:03.150 --> 04:07.113
I have realized that I don't need
a blackboard or a classroom

04:08.029 --> 04:09.827
to set an example.

04:28.341 --> 04:29.934
Adios, bitches.

04:40.812 --> 04:44.237
Baby doll? I am home.

04:44.237 --> 04:45.533
In here.

04:45.533 --> 04:49.079
Get yourself hard, because I am going to
suck your dick like I am mad at it.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.197
Oh.

04:50.572 --> 04:55.294
Look, your mom's here.
Hi, Mom. What a fun surprise.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.871
Suitcases. Honey,
are we going on a trip?

04:57.871 --> 05:00.628
Uh, Elizabeth,
we need to talk.

05:00.628 --> 05:01.674
Sure.

05:01.674 --> 05:05.050
I am starting to think that
maybe we need to take a break.

05:05.050 --> 05:06.425
Forever.
Mom.

05:06.425 --> 05:08.678
Tell her what the accountant said.
Mom.

05:09.591 --> 05:13.641
Steven said that you spent
$16,000 last month.

05:14.387 --> 05:15.730
He thinks you're bad news.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.150
I know women like you.
Damn it, Mom.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.977
I told you I
could handle this.

05:19.977 --> 05:21.858
I just want to ask
her something.

05:21.858 --> 05:24.193
You truly love my son?

05:24.648 --> 05:27.071
I love him so much it hurts.

05:27.776 --> 05:31.155
All right, then.
When is his birthday? Mom.

05:32.781 --> 05:37.537
I am not, you know... That is just offensive
that you would even ask me that.

05:37.537 --> 05:38.916
It's today.

05:40.165 --> 05:43.667
- I know. 
- God.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.845
That's why I got you this.

05:46.845 --> 05:49.389
Okay? Honey, happy birthday.

05:50.048 --> 05:52.346
Boston Market?
And I was going to suck his dick.

05:52.346 --> 05:53.517
So two presents.

05:53.517 --> 05:54.594
Mmm-hmm.

05:54.594 --> 05:57.306
Okay, fine.
I will sign the prenup.

05:57.848 --> 05:59.725
it's over, Elizabeth.

06:00.392 --> 06:01.689
Mark, I am pregnant.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.190
Bullshit.
No, you're not.

06:03.895 --> 06:05.818
Okay, fine, I am not
actually pregnant.

06:05.818 --> 06:08.150
You know what,
I am starting to wonder

06:08.150 --> 06:10.861
whether this has always been
about the money.

06:10.861 --> 06:13.197
You never loved me.
I don't love you?

06:13.197 --> 06:16.705
I have been listening to you whine
about opera for the last year.

06:16.992 --> 06:21.668
Okay. If the younger generation doesn't
get into opera, then guess what?

06:21.668 --> 06:24.625
No more opera.
An art form has died.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.427
If opera goes away,
we're fucked.

06:28.169 --> 06:29.341
I want my ring back.

06:29.796 --> 06:32.640
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Where am I supposed to go?

07:07.709 --> 07:11.339
There she is.
Elizabeth Halsey.

07:14.049 --> 07:17.053
I am so excited we're going to be
across-the-hall mates,

07:17.053 --> 07:20.898
but I am so sad it's because
your relationship ended.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.684
Who are you, again?
Amy Squirrel.

07:24.935 --> 07:27.905
Squirrel?
Yeah. You know...

07:29.981 --> 07:33.827
Don't worry, you were kind of
a lone wolf last year

07:33.827 --> 07:36.906
and so busy planning
the wedding.

07:37.405 --> 07:40.249
I found him in bed with somebody else.
Oh, my gosh.

07:40.249 --> 07:43.374
It was another man.
Shut the front door.

07:45.121 --> 07:46.964
Somebody needs a hug.

07:46.964 --> 07:48.257
Somebody doesn't.

07:48.833 --> 07:54.215
Look. I know you kind of skated by last
year, doing the bare-minimum thing,

07:54.215 --> 07:57.016
but I just want to say,
now you're back,

07:57.016 --> 08:01.313
I just know you are going to
get your teaching on.

08:05.558 --> 08:08.528
I thought the teachers were
supposed to get the apples.

08:08.528 --> 08:12.278
Well, I think the students teach me
at least as much as I teach them.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.910
That's just something
I say sometimes.

08:15.910 --> 08:17.112
Stupid.

08:25.078 --> 08:26.079
Hmm...

08:33.294 --> 08:37.890
Sorry. I just wanted to know if
you wanted to grab some lunch.

08:38.466 --> 08:40.013
I am kind of in the middle
of something, Lynn.

08:40.013 --> 08:41.227
My treat.

08:43.013 --> 08:45.436
You know, Lynn, when
I first started teaching

08:45.436 --> 08:48.268
I thought that I was doing it
for all the right reasons.

08:48.268 --> 08:50.854
Shorter hours, summers off,
no accountability.

08:50.854 --> 08:54.825
I love my summers.
Fresh corn. Mmm.

08:54.825 --> 08:59.033
From now on, my full-time job is finding
a guy who's going to take care of me.

08:59.033 --> 09:00.622
God, I pray for that.

09:00.622 --> 09:04.247
You know, I spent my entire summer hanging
out at bars near where the Bulls practice.

09:04.993 --> 09:07.291
I had some fun,
got some cool souvenirs,

09:07.291 --> 09:09.293
but those guys are not
looking to settle down.

09:09.293 --> 09:11.500
I mean, they all wear condoms,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.712
then they take the condoms with them.
That's how paranoid they are.

09:14.712 --> 09:18.340
Like it's so easy to get pregnant
from some dude nutting into a condom.

09:18.757 --> 09:20.851
Yeah. Ugh. Yeah.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.929
You're going to find
someone great. You are.

09:23.929 --> 09:27.892
I have been thinking about it a lot.
I am like an eight, eight and a half.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.228
But if I got a new
pair of tits, right?

09:31.228 --> 09:34.196
You don't want to do that.
You're already so pretty.

09:34.731 --> 09:39.612
You have no idea how difficult it is to
compete against these Barbie doll types.

09:40.195 --> 09:44.041
Yeah, that's true.
And we're not getting any younger.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.918
Yeah. Though we should finish up.

09:48.119 --> 09:51.464
Wally's got that big
orientation in the auditorium.

09:51.464 --> 09:54.710
Yeah, I am not going to go to that.
But it's mandatory.

09:55.502 --> 09:56.503
Ooh.

09:59.089 --> 10:01.467
I probably won't go either.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.601
No, I might.

10:03.843 --> 10:07.313
I will probably go and just sit in the back.
Maybe leave early.

10:07.931 --> 10:13.279
Maybe stay to the end.
Play it by ear, or just stay to the end.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.354
Oh.

10:14.354 --> 10:16.155
I don't know.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.568
Okay, well,
this was fun, huh?

10:25.240 --> 10:30.622
You, me, Aruba, my boat,
this weekend, what do you say?

10:31.037 --> 10:32.880
You think I don't see that
faint tan line on your finger

10:32.880 --> 10:34.879
where your wedding
band usually is?

10:34.879 --> 10:37.427
This is not my
first rodeo, Sarge.

10:37.427 --> 10:40.346
Why don't you introduce me
to your single co-worker?

10:40.346 --> 10:41.923
One o'clock.

10:42.924 --> 10:45.052
Hey, I am Jason.
Hi.

10:45.385 --> 10:47.387
So that's where I learned to water ski.

10:47.387 --> 10:49.643
I fucking love
Lake Geneva.

10:54.727 --> 10:57.822
I love your belt.
Who makes it?

10:58.773 --> 11:02.198
We should do something next weekend.
You should take me somewhere.

11:02.198 --> 11:03.369
You don't have
a plane, do you?

11:03.369 --> 11:05.412
Yeah, right. I am
just a trainee.

11:07.282 --> 11:09.455
A What?
A trainee.

11:09.455 --> 11:12.125
How much more time are we talking here?
Tomorrow's my last day.

11:12.912 --> 11:14.084
Okay.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.635
The second I finish,
I am going to my boss's office,

11:18.635 --> 11:21.179
and I am telling that
motherfucker to go fuck himself.

11:21.179 --> 11:23.723
See, I want to do
something that matters.

11:24.048 --> 11:27.973
I am going back to school and
becoming an occupational therapist.

11:27.973 --> 11:31.226
I want to do something
important, just like you.

11:34.142 --> 11:35.644
An occupational therapist?

11:36.811 --> 11:40.156
Do I look like I want to marry a
fucking occupational therapist?

11:54.287 --> 11:55.960
Fuck my ass.

11:59.334 --> 12:02.508
Welcome to Air Seventh
Grade Social Studies.

12:02.837 --> 12:05.386
I will be your captain,
Miss Squirrel.

12:05.386 --> 12:09.345
Cruising altitude for the year will be
world geography through current events.

12:09.345 --> 12:11.221
We may have a layover in civics,

12:11.221 --> 12:14.729
so buckle up, because
it's going to be a crazy ride.

12:17.727 --> 12:20.606
The photographer
was, like, so nice.

12:20.606 --> 12:23.658
He made me feel, like,
really, really comfortable.

12:23.658 --> 12:26.577
I might get flown to Kansas
City for their fashion week.

12:26.577 --> 12:28.326
Kansas City.

12:29.197 --> 12:30.323
Stalk much?

12:32.367 --> 12:33.835
Loser.

12:54.847 --> 12:58.602
Hi. I am Sasha Abernathy.
My mother baked these cookies for you.

12:59.102 --> 13:00.729
Just leave them on the desk.

13:05.775 --> 13:06.867
You need something?

13:10.947 --> 13:14.167
Anyone seen Stand and Deliver?
Show of hands.

13:15.368 --> 13:18.793
You kidding me?
Edward James Olmos?

13:20.957 --> 13:22.083
Lou Diamond Phillips?

13:24.210 --> 13:25.928
Wow. All right.

13:25.928 --> 13:30.009
You and you, grab
the TV and roll it up front.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.139
We're watching a movie
on the first day?

13:32.139 --> 13:34.437
I think it's awesome.
You rock.

13:39.976 --> 13:41.102
These cookies suck.

13:51.654 --> 13:53.952
Would everyone
please try to find a seat?

13:57.535 --> 13:58.707
Incoming.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.334
Garrett, honey?

14:06.377 --> 14:09.847
Elizabeth. Hey. Russell.

14:11.299 --> 14:12.767
Russell Gettis,
gym teacher.

14:12.767 --> 14:16.392
We did bus duty together
last spring. Yeah.

14:16.392 --> 14:19.941
So, I heard about the whole
engagement thing. That blows.

14:19.941 --> 14:23.020
Did you know I walked in
on him trying to fuck his dog?

14:23.020 --> 14:24.445
Peanut butter everywhere.

14:24.979 --> 14:25.980
That's gross.

14:25.980 --> 14:29.609
Anyway... Hey, uh,
might be too soon,

14:29.609 --> 14:32.741
but you want to, like, grab a
bite or something sometime?

14:33.071 --> 14:35.199
You still a gym teacher?
I am, yeah.

14:35.199 --> 14:36.874
Then no.

14:37.784 --> 14:40.788
I don't date co-workers.
I won't tell anyone.

14:40.788 --> 14:42.747
I also said no.

14:43.164 --> 14:46.043
Okay, cool. Well, this has been awesome.

14:48.461 --> 14:50.839
Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.

14:51.547 --> 14:53.675
What? Did you see the
coleslaw altercation?

14:55.009 --> 14:58.980
Yeah. That one kid hit the
other kid with some coleslaw.

14:59.806 --> 15:03.026
You weren't at the orientation
the other day. Okay.

15:03.026 --> 15:06.196
Boy, Elizabeth, you missed
a boatload of stuff.

15:06.979 --> 15:12.531
Anyways, at the orientation, I suggested
a new system for supervising lunch.

15:12.777 --> 15:14.450
It's a quadrant system.

15:14.450 --> 15:17.123
I tell you what, why don't
you just send me a memo,

15:17.123 --> 15:19.166
and, if I have any
questions, I will find you.

15:19.909 --> 15:21.661
Oh, ooh.

15:21.661 --> 15:23.129
Yeah. Meant to ask,

15:23.129 --> 15:28.173
did I hear you were showing a movie this
morning on the first day of school?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.303
How do I know
what you heard?

15:30.303 --> 15:33.723
Listen, I don't want to tell you
how to run your class,

15:33.723 --> 15:37.519
but maybe it might be fun
to try some ice breakers.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.971
Like telephone charades
or the string game.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.314
Are we going to have
a problem, me and you?

15:46.602 --> 15:48.275
God, no.

15:49.856 --> 15:55.613
If I gave you that impression, well,
I am so sorry because, actually,

15:55.613 --> 15:59.199
I was really hoping we could be more
than just across-the-hall mates.

15:59.907 --> 16:02.786
I don't know what you heard,
but I don't eat muff pie.

16:03.369 --> 16:07.670
No, of course not.
I don't even know what that is.

16:07.670 --> 16:10.752
I just meant friends.

16:10.752 --> 16:14.260
Tell you what, friend, I have
got to get going. Cover me.

16:16.466 --> 16:19.094
Elizabeth, lunch doesn't end
for another seven minutes.

16:19.094 --> 16:21.600
Who's going to watch
your quadrant?

16:30.771 --> 16:33.650
Hi, there. You look
like Losty McLosterson.

16:34.317 --> 16:37.617
I know, right?
Can you tell me where Room 107 is?

16:37.617 --> 16:39.572
I will do you one better.
I will take you there.

16:40.114 --> 16:43.414
You don't have to do that.
Oh, stop it. Be my pleasure.

16:43.868 --> 16:45.541
Scott Delacorte.
Elizabeth Halsey.

16:46.037 --> 16:48.586
I am the new sub.
Welcome, welcome.

16:48.586 --> 16:51.258
Thank you.
Is that a Jaeger-LeCoultre?

16:51.751 --> 16:53.799
Good eye.
Thanks.

16:53.799 --> 16:55.846
I love men's watches.
it's kind of a hobby.

16:55.846 --> 17:00.177
You know, sometimes I get self-conscious
about it, but my grandfather made it, so...

17:00.177 --> 17:03.521
Your grandfather designs watches?
The family business.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.269
Yeah, my mother's maiden name
is LeCoultre.

17:07.016 --> 17:08.689
Shut up.

17:09.018 --> 17:11.316
So, did you and your
wife just move to town?

17:11.316 --> 17:15.319
I am not married.
I actually just got out of a relationship.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.367
Catherine. Yeah.

17:17.859 --> 17:20.659
It's been a year and she's still
the wallpaper on my phone.

17:20.988 --> 17:23.366
She has such a big heart.

17:23.366 --> 17:26.127
Looks like enormous.

17:30.206 --> 17:34.928
As you can see, the weight is evenly
distributed and there's minimal scarring.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.172
Dr. Vogel,
best hands in Chicago.

17:38.798 --> 17:42.098
May I? Absolutely.
Take them for a spin.

17:44.136 --> 17:45.638
God.

17:46.514 --> 17:48.141
Wow.
Yeah.

17:48.141 --> 17:49.775
These are amazing.

17:49.775 --> 17:50.893
Thank you.

17:51.310 --> 17:52.983
And the nipples.

17:52.983 --> 17:54.063
I know.

17:54.564 --> 17:55.690
I will take two.

18:02.029 --> 18:04.407
The total is $9,300
for the surgery,

18:04.407 --> 18:06.492
plus one night
stay at our facility.

18:07.076 --> 18:08.328
How would you like to pay?

18:08.328 --> 18:09.495
That's absurd.

18:09.495 --> 18:11.752
I am a teacher,
not a drug dealer.

18:11.998 --> 18:14.217
We accept all
major credit cards.

18:14.217 --> 18:18.930
Yeah, well, my credit situation
is a little complicated.

18:19.338 --> 18:22.342
I am sorry, but if you can't pay, then
I can't schedule the appointment.

18:23.342 --> 18:25.390
I just really need some money.

18:26.679 --> 18:29.432
As a matter of fact,
it is about my tits, Dad.

18:30.850 --> 18:33.694
Well, maybe if I had gotten
yours and not Mom's...

18:34.186 --> 18:36.860
Look, I am not going to beat
around the bush, Grandma.

18:37.189 --> 18:39.032
I am dying and I need
money for surgery.

18:42.695 --> 18:44.572
Really? Nothing.

18:45.364 --> 18:48.038
I am rooming with a guy
I met on Craigslist.

18:48.409 --> 18:49.956
All I am asking you for is $10,000.

18:51.621 --> 18:56.377
You owe me for breaking off the engagement.
You know how humiliating that was?

18:57.460 --> 18:58.552
Okay.

18:59.253 --> 19:02.052
Lover, lover, look,
I don't want to fight.

19:02.256 --> 19:04.975
It's only $10,000.
It would mean the world to me.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.060
Lover?

19:08.387 --> 19:09.559
Are you there?

19:11.390 --> 19:12.482
Fucking troll.

19:13.225 --> 19:15.102
Did you call my name?
No.

19:15.436 --> 19:18.940
I said, "Fucking troll."
I thought you said "Kirk."

19:21.275 --> 19:22.492
Do you have 10 grand?

19:23.569 --> 19:24.570
Nope.

19:25.279 --> 19:28.624
And, also, I might be a little
short on rent this month.

19:29.075 --> 19:30.122
Like a lot short.

19:31.118 --> 19:32.165
This might help.

19:34.789 --> 19:37.668
You want to get wasted?
Uh, yeah.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.294
Cool. See you.

19:42.129 --> 19:45.759
We are in a state
of emergency and my word is law.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.477
There's only one boss in this
place and that's me.

19:50.012 --> 19:51.855
The HNIC.

19:53.474 --> 19:56.318
All right. We will pick
this up again tomorrow.

19:59.855 --> 20:01.152
Can I help you?

20:12.993 --> 20:14.040
What?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.997
I am the student leader
for the trip to Springfield.

20:16.288 --> 20:17.289
Shocker.

20:17.289 --> 20:19.091
We're having our
car wash this weekend.

20:19.091 --> 20:20.793
If you're around,
maybe we could wash your car.

20:20.793 --> 20:23.304
I got some Mexicans that
already do it for nothing.

20:23.304 --> 20:26.178
Well, the Springfield trip's the
best part of seventh grade.

20:26.632 --> 20:28.976
Last year's car wash raised $6,000.

20:30.302 --> 20:31.303
Woah.

20:32.638 --> 20:34.106
Bringing these
magazines to school

20:34.106 --> 20:35.808
is not the way you're going to
make friends, Arkady.

20:35.808 --> 20:37.359
Those eighth grade
boys are just using you.

20:37.977 --> 20:39.729
So I go now?

20:40.146 --> 20:44.447
Yes, you go now, but if I see these
again, I am going to call your parents.

20:44.447 --> 20:45.651
Do you understand?

20:47.737 --> 20:48.909
Go to class.

20:50.698 --> 20:52.166
Hey, hey. Hey.

20:54.326 --> 20:55.373
Go to class.

20:59.707 --> 21:01.505
Another exciting day
at the principal's office.

21:02.585 --> 21:04.462
Do you have a second?
Uh, yeah.

21:04.462 --> 21:06.388
Oh, you know what,
I wanted to talk to you, too.

21:06.388 --> 21:09.764
Did I hear that right, that you
were showing movies all last week?

21:09.967 --> 21:10.968
Hmm?

21:10.968 --> 21:12.303
Some clips, maybe.

21:12.887 --> 21:16.812
But, you know, in a lot of ways, I
think that movies are the new books.

21:18.017 --> 21:19.018
Uh-huh.

21:27.485 --> 21:28.611
Is this new?

21:29.320 --> 21:31.322
God, I love it.

21:31.864 --> 21:35.459
You know, I have always said that
dolphins are the humans of the sea.

21:36.327 --> 21:38.045
I have a bumper sticker
that says that.

21:38.746 --> 21:40.919
No way.
I am not kidding.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.129
It's on my car.

21:44.335 --> 21:45.382
Come on.

21:46.879 --> 21:47.926
Hold on a sec.

21:55.596 --> 21:57.098
His name is Simon,

21:58.015 --> 22:03.897
and he lives in the Cayman
Islands with his brother, Ajax.

22:04.688 --> 22:05.735
Wow.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.026
What a great story.

22:09.777 --> 22:10.869
What did you want to talk about?

22:11.487 --> 22:13.615
I was thinking that I want to
get more involved.

22:13.906 --> 22:16.034
You know, I don't know,
something like

22:16.034 --> 22:19.837
maybe supervising the
seventh grade car wash.

22:20.246 --> 22:23.625
Uh, you know, Amy has been
running that for like two years.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.420
Yeah, but she does so much already.
It might be nice to give her a little rest.

22:29.129 --> 22:33.305
It's so nice to see you becoming a
real member of the JAMS family.

22:34.718 --> 22:36.015
Just feels so good to help.

22:54.488 --> 22:55.956
Holy shit.

22:56.615 --> 22:58.583
All right. Let's do this.

23:01.203 --> 23:03.877
# In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey

23:03.877 --> 23:06.050
# Sniffing around to your door

23:06.050 --> 23:08.753
# In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy

23:08.753 --> 23:11.721
# Telling me I got to have more

23:20.389 --> 23:23.017
# In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise

23:23.017 --> 23:25.194
# Telling me what's in store

23:25.194 --> 23:27.897
# My heart start aching
My body start a-shaking and I

23:28.105 --> 23:30.483
# Can't take no more

23:34.403 --> 23:36.980
# No, no...... #

23:54.048 --> 23:56.426
Hey, Mr. Delacorte. Yes.

23:58.802 --> 24:01.555
Hey, kids. Hey. Hey.

24:02.222 --> 24:03.599
Hey, you better not
take it for a joyride.

24:03.599 --> 24:04.808
Are you sure?
I am watching you.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.023
Miss Halsey.
Hey.

24:07.023 --> 24:08.945
I am impressed.
Thanks. I have been working out.

24:08.945 --> 24:10.113
What a turnout.

24:11.315 --> 24:13.443
Oh, yeah, and the kids
are just having a blast.

24:13.943 --> 24:15.115
Well, that's
what it's all about.

24:15.569 --> 24:16.946
God, you know, we should
go get a drink tonight.

24:16.946 --> 24:18.281
I feel like getting drunk.

24:19.782 --> 24:23.878
I mean, not "drunk" drunk.
Strong buzz. Still be able to drive.

24:24.453 --> 24:25.670
I am sorry.

24:26.246 --> 24:27.839
I can't yet.
I am just not ready.

24:28.165 --> 24:31.419
But, if you're patient, I think
I might be worth your while.

24:31.794 --> 24:32.886
You're worth the wait.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.051
I think so, too.

24:48.060 --> 24:49.482
Shish kebabs.

24:59.530 --> 25:01.874
Wally? it's Amy Squirrel.

25:02.658 --> 25:05.958
Amy? What are you...
Get out of here.

25:06.495 --> 25:07.917
This will just take a sec.

25:08.247 --> 25:12.718
Um, I happened to be pedaling past the
seventh grade car wash this Saturday.

25:12.718 --> 25:14.636
Can we talk about this later?

25:15.004 --> 25:17.678
"Later, we will all die,"
said the gator to the fly.

25:18.841 --> 25:20.263
What the fuck? What?

25:21.677 --> 25:22.724
Just go.

25:25.222 --> 25:29.318
Now, I don't want to speak out of school,
but, from where I was sitting,

25:29.601 --> 25:30.773
I think...

25:31.770 --> 25:36.742
It seemed like Miss Halsey was getting
pretty chummy with the money.

25:37.609 --> 25:43.457
Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
from the seventh grade car wash?

25:43.907 --> 25:47.832
Wally, we barely know
anything about her.

25:48.037 --> 25:50.256
Hey, you know what?
They raised almost $7,000,

25:50.256 --> 25:52.003
so whatever she did worked.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.838
Viet Huynh's dad called.

25:54.084 --> 25:56.132
He said the car wash
was a raging success.

25:56.336 --> 25:57.633
And Lauren Rissman's
dad called.

25:57.633 --> 25:59.715
He said we should have
a car wash every weekend.

26:00.632 --> 26:03.636
So instead of accusing her, you might
want to ask her for some pointers.

26:04.219 --> 26:09.146
Well, if those pointers include wearing
provocative beachwear for money,

26:09.767 --> 26:11.769
I think I will pass.
This is ridiculous.

26:11.769 --> 26:13.820
This is the one
place in this building

26:13.820 --> 26:15.944
where I am allowed
to be alone with my thoughts.

26:16.398 --> 26:19.698
I only have this once a day.
If I am lucky.

26:20.527 --> 26:23.030
Next time you accuse one of
my teachers of stealing,

26:23.030 --> 26:25.957
you better have some
evidence. God damn it.

26:26.408 --> 26:27.500
We are done here.

26:30.662 --> 26:31.663
All righty.

26:33.082 --> 26:35.176
Have a super awesome day, you two.

26:41.590 --> 26:43.843
Holy fuck, I thought
she was never going to leave.

26:55.521 --> 26:57.523
How are things
going with Scott?

26:57.773 --> 27:00.322
Jesus Christ, Lynn.
The guy just went through a terrible breakup.

27:00.322 --> 27:02.152
Yeah. What he needs
now more than ever

27:02.152 --> 27:04.655
is a friend.
You know, I think that's really smart.

27:04.655 --> 27:05.785
Build a foundation...
Yeah,

27:05.785 --> 27:08.913
build a foundation and then
after my surgery, pow, we fuck.

27:10.536 --> 27:12.413
I don't know. I think love
should be about...

27:12.413 --> 27:15.212
I got to go, Lynn.
Here, hold this for me. Okay.

27:15.541 --> 27:16.542
Thanks.

27:20.754 --> 27:22.381
Are we starting
School Ties today?

27:26.885 --> 27:29.308
Okay. Today we're
starting School Ties.

27:29.721 --> 27:32.315
Brendan Fraser plays a Jew.
Classic.

27:34.726 --> 27:38.651
Okay, who has the answer?
Here it is. Good luck.

27:38.651 --> 27:39.822
Here "what" is?

27:39.822 --> 27:42.276
It's the pre-test for the
state standardized test.

27:42.609 --> 27:43.781
It was in the memo.

27:44.695 --> 27:45.696
Ah.

27:45.696 --> 27:47.247
Yes, the memo.

27:51.785 --> 27:54.584
Hey, zip it. Zip your shit.

27:59.418 --> 28:02.422
Okay, look. We all know
that these tests are gay.

28:04.506 --> 28:05.632
Hey.

28:06.758 --> 28:08.476
According to this memo,

28:08.476 --> 28:11.063
I am supposed to give you guys
45 minutes per section.

28:11.063 --> 28:12.560
Bla, bla, bla, bla...

28:12.560 --> 28:16.815
Okay. Clear your desks,
everybody. Pencils out.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.112
Begin.

28:23.192 --> 28:24.444
What's going on with you?

28:25.319 --> 28:26.696
You need a tissue, huh?

28:28.155 --> 28:31.455
She is such a phony.
Yeah, a major phony.

28:31.825 --> 28:34.419
Yeah, but she also
cares a lot, too.

28:38.874 --> 28:41.673
I love how his eyes
sparkle when he smiles.

28:41.673 --> 28:43.220
I want to sit
on his face.

28:43.629 --> 28:45.176
Hey, guys.
Hey.

28:45.589 --> 28:48.263
Hey. You are just making
a habit out of this,

28:48.263 --> 28:49.389
aren't you?

28:49.389 --> 28:51.516
Actually, Sandy Pinkus
in the math department,

28:52.012 --> 28:55.232
I guess someone slashed his
tires. And his wife's, too.

28:56.099 --> 28:57.442
That is awful.

28:57.442 --> 29:00.901
Lynn, will you go grab me some milk?
What kind of milk do you want?

29:01.271 --> 29:04.571
Skim, whole, 2%, chocolate?

29:04.571 --> 29:05.651
Surprise me.

29:05.901 --> 29:08.745
Okay, I will get you skim. No, 2%.

29:11.114 --> 29:12.411
So?
So?

29:13.033 --> 29:15.286
Hola, fellow educators.

29:17.955 --> 29:20.299
Is everything okay with Gaby?
She will be fine.

29:20.299 --> 29:23.173
I told her, "Gaby, if you're
not happy with yourself,

29:23.173 --> 29:25.675
"you can't expect others
to be happy with you.

29:25.963 --> 29:27.681
"It starts with you."

29:27.681 --> 29:29.557
I am sure she appreciated that.
Yeah.

29:31.301 --> 29:32.803
And it's exactly what I told Elizabeth

29:32.803 --> 29:35.639
when she told me about
this upcoming fake breast job.

29:35.639 --> 29:36.765
Oh.

29:39.268 --> 29:42.568
Sorry. Sorry, I thought
you were telling everyone.

29:43.146 --> 29:45.274
Did you?
Well, I am pro choice.

29:45.274 --> 29:48.361
I believe everyone should choose
whatever makes them happiest.

29:48.986 --> 29:50.329
Except abortion, of course.

29:50.329 --> 29:51.576
Of course.
Obviously.

29:52.531 --> 29:55.910
Well, it looks like algebra
is calling. I hate math.

29:56.201 --> 29:57.544
- Wish me luck.
- Hi.

29:57.544 --> 30:00.964
I am a math terrorist,
with close ties to Aljaybra.

30:01.665 --> 30:04.293
I have weapons of
math instruction.

30:12.384 --> 30:13.431
Here, I will walk you.

30:13.677 --> 30:16.601
Man, everyone is so nice around here.
Of course.

30:16.930 --> 30:18.273
Hey, watch my quadrant.

30:19.474 --> 30:21.693
Here you go, 1%. Surprise.

30:22.400 --> 30:27.779
Hi. My name is Elizabeth
Halsey. Any questions?

30:28.275 --> 30:30.152
Hi. I am Sasha's mother.

30:30.694 --> 30:34.619
I am a little concerned at the
importance you're placing on movies.

30:35.073 --> 30:37.997
I was just wondering what your
plans were for the state test.

30:38.577 --> 30:42.457
Listen, the school hired me
because I am amazing at what I do.

30:42.956 --> 30:44.549
I use movies as
one of my tools,

30:44.549 --> 30:48.720
but I also use a variety of
other multimedia techniques.

30:49.463 --> 30:52.057
Listen, I could take you day-by-day
through my entire syllabus,

30:52.057 --> 30:53.554
but that's just not
how I do things.

30:54.509 --> 30:58.685
So that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

30:59.806 --> 31:03.185
Please, help yourself to some delicious
snacks and drinks in the back.

31:05.228 --> 31:06.400
Class dismissed.

31:06.855 --> 31:10.280
Excuse me, Miss Halsey?
Hi, I am Morgan's dad.

31:11.651 --> 31:12.903
Morgan.

31:14.279 --> 31:16.532
Great kid. So precocious.

31:16.907 --> 31:18.705
I just wish Morgan's grades
would reflect it.

31:19.242 --> 31:24.544
If I know Morgan, and I think
I do, Morgan will get there.

31:24.831 --> 31:28.176
Listen, I am sure you have a full plate,
along with a rocking hot body,

31:28.543 --> 31:31.012
but if you could just
keep an eye on Morgan,

31:31.012 --> 31:32.886
my wife and I would
really appreciate it.

31:33.423 --> 31:36.427
For supplies and whatever.

31:38.929 --> 31:40.181
For supplies.

31:41.306 --> 31:44.276
You're Chase's parents.
Hi.

31:44.276 --> 31:45.861
You know, a student like Chase

31:45.861 --> 31:48.780
would benefit so much
from some extra attention.

31:49.398 --> 31:51.400
So you think we should hire a tutor?

31:51.400 --> 31:52.951
You know, I'd be happy to do it myself,

31:52.951 --> 31:58.203
but it's just so hard with a class
of 20, 25, or 30, or whatever.

31:58.865 --> 32:00.117
To be a teacher.

32:00.117 --> 32:05.001
God, it is so hard on my salary to have to
pay for my own supplies, and my fiance,

32:05.001 --> 32:06.582
he cheated on
me with his sister.

32:08.166 --> 32:12.512
As her personal tutor, I guarantee
personally that she will get an A,

32:12.796 --> 32:15.219
or your money back.

32:16.508 --> 32:19.307
- Well.
- Say no more.

32:22.389 --> 32:23.686
Make it out to "cash."

32:24.474 --> 32:27.193
# As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

32:27.193 --> 32:30.569
# I take a look at my life and
realize there's not much left

32:30.569 --> 32:33.651
# Because I have been blasting
and laughing so long that

32:33.651 --> 32:36.577
# Even my mamma thinks
that my mind is gone

32:36.577 --> 32:39.532
# But I ain't never crossed
a man that didn't deserve it

32:39.532 --> 32:43.434
# Me, be treated like a punk,
you know that's unheard of... #

32:44.077 --> 32:45.124
Is that true?

32:45.124 --> 32:47.297
But when I go to my grave,
my head will be high.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.918
There are no victims
in this classroom.

33:10.896 --> 33:14.366
Scott? Scott? Scott?

33:15.108 --> 33:16.360
Amy.
Hi.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.620
Hi.
I got you something.

33:19.237 --> 33:21.706
What?
You didn't have to do that.

33:21.706 --> 33:24.534
It's nothing.
Well, it's my favorite book.

33:27.204 --> 33:28.251
Eat, Pray, Love.

33:28.830 --> 33:29.877
Yeah.

33:31.958 --> 33:33.505
This is my favorite book, too.

33:34.878 --> 33:36.380
What's your favorite part?

33:38.632 --> 33:39.679
Love.

33:45.847 --> 33:48.845
# When there's lightning

33:49.100 --> 33:52.968
# You know it always brings me down.... #

33:54.314 --> 33:55.566
What do you want?

33:55.566 --> 33:57.401
Is that marijuana?

33:58.109 --> 34:01.739
No, it's medicinal marijuana.
I have a prescription and everything.

34:02.531 --> 34:05.205
But I am not going to tell you why, because
it's between me and my doctor.

34:05.205 --> 34:06.284
Oh.

34:06.618 --> 34:09.041
Okay, well, feel better.

34:09.663 --> 34:10.710
Thanks.

34:11.498 --> 34:13.216
My mom and I made you
some holiday cookies.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.507
Are those oatmeal raisin again?
Gingerbread.

34:19.965 --> 34:21.512
Let me see it. Have it.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.179
Watch the bow.

34:27.222 --> 34:28.268
Do you have anything to drink?

34:30.225 --> 34:32.319
Listen, word to the wise,

34:33.395 --> 34:35.362
stop dressing like you're
running for Congress.

34:36.188 --> 34:38.658
I don't want to run for Congress.
I want to be president.

34:39.234 --> 34:40.451
See, that's what
I am talking about.

34:41.152 --> 34:42.779
Keep saying shit like that
and you're going to get punched.

34:44.697 --> 34:47.292
Do you really want to be president or
is that something your parents want?

34:50.911 --> 34:53.882
Look, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, who knows?

34:53.882 --> 34:56.176
One day you wake up, you decide
you want to be a masseuse.

34:57.002 --> 34:59.630
Salary plus tips.
Think about it.

35:01.381 --> 35:03.850
If I think about it,
will I get extra credit?

35:04.926 --> 35:06.052
Hopeless.

35:06.886 --> 35:11.232
All right. I am high as fuck.
I got to get out of here. Watch your feet.

35:18.857 --> 35:22.612
# I tried to call you before
but I lost my nerve

35:24.863 --> 35:29.835
# I tried my imagination
but I got disturbed

35:30.869 --> 35:33.247
This is indeed a winter wonderland.

35:33.247 --> 35:36.129
# Jenny, I got your number

35:36.129 --> 35:38.710
# I need to make you mine

35:38.710 --> 35:40.545
Want to go get high? Yeah.

35:41.254 --> 35:43.006
Give me a nug.
I will smoke it in my car.

35:44.174 --> 35:45.471
Wow. No.

35:45.925 --> 35:48.519
I meant, do you want to
get high with me?

35:49.888 --> 35:53.438
# Eight, six, seven, five,
three, oh, nine, Nine #

35:53.438 --> 35:57.191
# Eight, six, seven,
five, three, oh, nine #

35:57.479 --> 36:00.153
# I got it, I got it #
# I got it #

36:00.153 --> 36:02.859
Hey. They don't make songs
like this anymore, right?

36:03.234 --> 36:04.952
You know, that's
actually not true, Scott.

36:04.952 --> 36:10.702
I am writing a song right now
called 855-824-1777,

36:11.076 --> 36:12.828
extension 777.

36:16.456 --> 36:17.958
So you guys having an awesome time?
Yes.

36:17.958 --> 36:21.011
Oh, my God, I love to dance.
I could dance all night.

36:21.419 --> 36:23.012
Hey, could we go
somewhere and talk?

36:23.254 --> 36:25.177
Totally go for a
talk right now.

36:30.053 --> 36:31.100
What's up?

36:33.056 --> 36:35.058
Okay.

36:35.058 --> 36:37.519
I don't know how to say this.
I am kind of nervous.

36:37.519 --> 36:39.320
It's all just happening
so quickly.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.070
You can tell me anything, Scott.
You're one of my best friends.

36:43.149 --> 36:44.366
I am crushing on someone.

36:45.485 --> 36:48.364
I think you're pretty great, too.
Thanks. It's Amy.

36:50.198 --> 36:52.200
No running in the hall.

36:54.786 --> 36:55.878
Kids.

36:55.878 --> 36:58.252
She's been amazing helping
me deal with my break-up.

36:58.540 --> 36:59.757
Yeah, I don't know
her that well.

36:59.757 --> 37:01.881
I know all the other teachers
really hate her fucking guts,

37:01.881 --> 37:03.303
but I stay above
all that stuff.

37:04.337 --> 37:06.010
Can I be honest with you?

37:06.548 --> 37:07.595
Of course.

37:08.216 --> 37:13.643
It's nothing personal, but I don't
think that you're Amy's type.

37:14.848 --> 37:16.020
Really?
Yeah.

37:16.933 --> 37:20.654
We seem so,
I don't know, simpatico.

37:21.229 --> 37:23.027
How do I put this politely?

37:23.398 --> 37:26.447
She's a lesbian.
She hates cock.

37:27.944 --> 37:28.945
Oh.

37:28.945 --> 37:30.905
She's only using you
for your money.

37:31.865 --> 37:32.912
What?

37:35.493 --> 37:36.870
Well, I feel stupid.

37:37.162 --> 37:40.712
No, Scott. Scott. Look at me.

37:41.291 --> 37:43.293
I am going to get my breasts
enlarged in a couple of months,

37:43.293 --> 37:46.547
and when I recover from my surgery,
you and I are going to go out

37:46.547 --> 37:49.007
and we are going to find awesome
people for each other.

37:50.258 --> 37:51.430
That sounds nice.

37:51.885 --> 37:53.762
You're out of your mind.

37:53.970 --> 37:56.314
There is no way that LeBron
will ever be Jordan.

37:56.314 --> 37:58.107
Nobody will ever
be Jordan, okay?

37:58.107 --> 38:00.185
Okay, LeBron's a better
rebounder and passer.

38:00.435 --> 38:03.359
Will you let me finish?
Can you let me finish?

38:03.646 --> 38:05.614
Call me when LeBron
has six championships.

38:05.614 --> 38:08.906
Is that your only argument?
It's the only argument I need, Shawn.

38:13.531 --> 38:14.657
Let's get baked...

38:16.785 --> 38:19.334
...goods. We're going to go get
some baked goods.

38:22.874 --> 38:23.921
You got this?

38:26.461 --> 38:28.555
Just try it. Try it.

38:28.555 --> 38:30.883
Please, don't...
Stop pressuring her.

38:30.883 --> 38:33.343
How does she know she doesn't like
it if she's never tried it before?

38:33.343 --> 38:35.849
You know, we should probably
be getting back.

38:35.849 --> 38:38.102
Just fucking do it.
Weed is awesome.

38:49.859 --> 38:51.486
Hold it in.
Just blow it out.

38:51.486 --> 38:52.912
Hold it in.
Blow it out.

38:55.198 --> 38:58.168
Okay. Lynn,
I am going to take this.

38:59.285 --> 39:01.379
I am going to go find
a hot dog.

39:03.164 --> 39:04.211
Shit.

39:04.874 --> 39:07.593
Well, that was deeply unimpressive.
Like you can do better.

39:07.794 --> 39:09.341
Really? You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.

39:09.341 --> 39:10.467
Gym teacher.

39:13.925 --> 39:15.802
You understand this is what I do?
Yeah, I got it.

39:15.802 --> 39:17.016
Like, for a living?

39:17.016 --> 39:18.096
Mmm-hmm.

39:18.096 --> 39:19.310
All right.

39:30.108 --> 39:32.531
You have no upper-body strength.
Yes, I do.

39:32.777 --> 39:37.248
Just not in my arms or my chest. But 
I have cat-like reflexes. Makes up for it.

39:50.336 --> 39:53.590
So, all this is mine, by the way,
as far as the eye can see.

39:54.507 --> 39:56.305
Really love what you have
done with the place.

39:56.551 --> 39:59.771
Don't know if you noticed the nets, but
those are brand-new nets I had installed.

40:00.305 --> 40:01.431
This is original wood.

40:02.390 --> 40:03.892
See those
championship banners?

40:04.601 --> 40:06.478
When I first came to the
school, they weren't here.

40:07.645 --> 40:08.771
They were over there.

40:09.606 --> 40:11.233
I had them moved over there.

40:13.776 --> 40:14.868
So, Russell...

40:14.868 --> 40:16.029
Mmm-hmm.

40:16.029 --> 40:17.406
...what has to go wrong
in someone's life

40:17.406 --> 40:20.037
for them to end up being a
middle school gym teacher?

40:20.950 --> 40:23.203
Well, granted, it
wasn't the original plan.

40:23.203 --> 40:27.757
As a young boy, I wanted to be a
professor of Physical Education.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.342
At Harvard.

40:30.342 --> 40:33.805
But I don't know.
I like it here.

40:34.505 --> 40:37.759
What went so wrong in your life that
you ended up educating children?

40:38.426 --> 40:41.976
I don't know. Maybe I was a
bad person in another life.

40:44.557 --> 40:47.527
We should, like, go have a
drink sometime. Together.

40:47.977 --> 40:49.729
Like over winter break.
Nah.

40:50.647 --> 40:51.864
Got something brewing.

40:51.864 --> 40:53.692
Can I say something,
for the record?

40:53.692 --> 40:54.905
Fine.

40:54.905 --> 40:57.612
It's about your, the...

40:59.447 --> 41:01.950
The big, fake titties.
Are you really going to do that?

41:02.241 --> 41:03.242
Uh-huh.

41:03.493 --> 41:05.291
Why would you do that?
Your tits are fine.

41:05.291 --> 41:07.004
I like your tits.
Ask my roommate.

41:16.339 --> 41:17.716
Seriously?

41:19.258 --> 41:21.226
Fuck. Seriously?

41:24.889 --> 41:26.015
Come on.

41:27.350 --> 41:28.727
Seriously?

41:31.145 --> 41:32.192
Hey.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.699
Why are they closed?
It's Christmas.

41:35.525 --> 41:37.493
Whatever.
Hey, you got a lighter?

41:38.653 --> 41:41.452
Hey, Miss Halsey.
It's me, Garrett, from school.

41:41.452 --> 41:44.080
It's Garrett.
Having a nice Christmas?

41:44.534 --> 41:46.582
Aces. What are you doing
the rest of the day?

41:46.582 --> 41:47.787
You going to go see your family?

41:47.787 --> 41:53.677
Uh, you know, I am going to go see some people.
We're having like a big potluck. So...

41:54.961 --> 41:56.304
Miss Halsey.

41:56.304 --> 41:58.757
Would you like to come
and spend Christmas with us?

42:03.219 --> 42:06.598
# Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

42:06.598 --> 42:10.777
# It is the season to be jolly

42:10.777 --> 42:14.777
# Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

42:15.023 --> 42:17.276
# Don we now our yuletide carol #
# Deck the something else #

42:17.276 --> 42:20.703
We never remember it.
Every year we forget. What is that?

42:20.703 --> 42:22.405
Listen, I am really sorry
I have to eat and run.

42:22.405 --> 42:24.115
I got to head over to the shelter. So...

42:24.365 --> 42:25.366
Aw.

42:25.366 --> 42:28.203
The shelter?
That's so inspiring.

42:28.578 --> 42:30.296
Yeah. I really love helping bums.

42:31.372 --> 42:33.921
But you have to wait for dessert.
We have a real treat.

42:34.125 --> 42:36.423
Garrett, why don't you run and
get some of your new poetry?

42:36.794 --> 42:38.796
God. No one wants
to hear it.

42:39.130 --> 42:42.725
Oh, God, I am so embarrassed.
Don't be shy, Marbles.

42:43.384 --> 42:45.978
This is called "The Chase,"
by Garrett Tiara.

42:48.097 --> 42:53.274
"X-O, X-O My love for you is X-O, X-O

42:53.644 --> 42:56.818
"About her smile,
that I would walk a mile for

42:57.398 --> 43:01.824
"About her personality, that
makes me see the best in me

43:02.612 --> 43:09.587
"One glance, one dance Because
together, we can achieve balance"

43:10.787 --> 43:11.834
Thank you.

43:14.957 --> 43:17.676
I loved it, and I
usually hate poetry.

43:18.002 --> 43:20.505
Oh, Philip.
"Hate" on Christmas?

43:20.922 --> 43:23.175
Sorry, Santa. Sorry, Jesus.

43:25.510 --> 43:27.683
Why don't you two give me
a hand with dessert

43:27.683 --> 43:30.023
and we can let these two discuss?

43:30.765 --> 43:32.017
Oh, fuck.

43:33.684 --> 43:36.278
So the poem's
about that girl?

43:36.938 --> 43:38.030
Yeah, Chase.

43:39.315 --> 43:42.694
If I could just talk to her
and tell her how I feel,

43:42.694 --> 43:44.370
I know she'd understand.

43:45.530 --> 43:48.204
Listen, it's not going to
happen, buddy.

43:48.866 --> 43:51.335
I was that hot girl.
Hotter, even.

43:51.702 --> 43:55.047
And I would never have gone out with you.
And I am not saying that to be mean.

43:55.047 --> 43:56.466
I am saying that to be helpful.

43:56.791 --> 43:59.010
What do you know?
You don't even know our names.

43:59.010 --> 44:00.128
I will tell you what I know.

44:00.128 --> 44:02.054
A kid who wears
the same gymnastics sweatshirt

44:02.054 --> 44:04.349
three days a week isn't
getting laid until he's 29.

44:04.349 --> 44:05.512
That's what I know.

44:06.050 --> 44:09.304
This sweatshirt was my dad's.
it's all he left me when he left me.

44:09.971 --> 44:11.348
There's a reason
he didn't pack it.

44:13.057 --> 44:14.149
Just saying.

44:14.851 --> 44:19.402
Welcome to the number one New Year's
Eve party in the entire world.

44:19.402 --> 44:22.321
This is literally the
biggest party on Earth.

44:22.321 --> 44:23.902
Aren't you going out
with the other nurses?

44:25.319 --> 44:26.571
I am not a nurse.

44:27.405 --> 44:28.531
I thought you were a nurse.

44:29.323 --> 44:30.495
I am a teacher.

44:38.082 --> 44:42.428
...Lionel Richie, so don't even
think about going anywhere else.

44:42.712 --> 44:43.838
We will have the Jonas Brothers.

45:06.277 --> 45:08.371
Hey. Welcome back.

45:09.947 --> 45:13.542
Bunch of us are going out tonight to
see Period 5 play. Do you want to come?

45:14.285 --> 45:16.538
Period 5?
Yeah, the teacher band.

45:18.122 --> 45:19.795
I'd rather get
shot in the face.

45:22.293 --> 45:25.297
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:26.047 --> 45:28.095
So are you guys
coming to the Palace tonight?

45:28.382 --> 45:31.636
My band's going to do a few songs.
You're in Period 5?

45:31.636 --> 45:35.056
You're looking at the new rhythm
guitarist and backup vocalist.

45:35.306 --> 45:37.308
Should be fun.
Should be amazing.

45:37.308 --> 45:40.403
Lynn, you want to come?
Yes, yes.

45:42.104 --> 45:44.323
# A lullaby. I said...

45:44.323 --> 45:48.490
# Everything going to be all right

45:48.490 --> 45:52.665
# Rockabye, rockabye

45:53.908 --> 45:58.004
# Everything going to be all right

45:58.004 --> 46:02.334
# Rockabye, rockabye

46:02.917 --> 46:04.089
# Rockabye

46:07.004 --> 46:08.347
Lot of cute guys.

46:09.006 --> 46:11.008
You should go talk to someone, Lynn.

46:11.008 --> 46:13.390
I am fine here. I am fine.

46:13.390 --> 46:16.018
Come on, Lynn.
You need to loosen up and live a little.

46:16.018 --> 46:17.682
When was the last time
you had a good dicking?

46:17.932 --> 46:19.309
"A good dicking."

46:19.600 --> 46:21.398
Look, go talk to those
guys over there.

46:22.728 --> 46:24.105
In the cowboy hats?

46:24.105 --> 46:25.781
Yeah.
What?

46:26.482 --> 46:28.280
Oh, come on.
You come on.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.614
Now, go talk to them.

46:29.614 --> 46:31.446
What am I going to talk about?

46:31.446 --> 46:33.281
It doesn't matter, Lynn.

46:33.281 --> 46:35.082
Look, you go and you start
with one of them,

46:35.082 --> 46:36.625
then you start talking
to the other one,

46:36.625 --> 46:40.046
and then you go back to the first one
but still be touching the other one,

46:40.046 --> 46:42.215
and then you just choose.
Textbook.

46:42.215 --> 46:45.377
Yeah. From the world's
weirdest textbook.

46:45.377 --> 46:48.387
Let me finish my drink.
Now, Lynn.

46:48.387 --> 46:49.884
In a second.
No, go.

46:49.884 --> 46:51.048
I like it here.

46:51.048 --> 46:52.634
It is really fun over here.

46:52.634 --> 46:55.311
Lynn. Get your ass over
to those cowboys.

46:56.846 --> 47:00.191
Well, I am glad I wore
my fun underwear.

47:00.516 --> 47:01.563
Okay.

47:01.563 --> 47:07.740
# Everything going to be all right Rockabye #

47:07.740 --> 47:11.657
So, call me crazy, but this might be
the best Period 5 show of all time.

47:12.236 --> 47:13.909
What are you doing here, anyway?

47:14.363 --> 47:16.365
I thought it was poetry slam night.

47:17.241 --> 47:18.743
I was going to get drunk
and mock them.

47:19.076 --> 47:20.419
That sounds fun, actually.

47:20.419 --> 47:22.046
I will let you know
next time I go.

47:22.413 --> 47:23.756
Not that fun.

47:24.248 --> 47:25.340
Okay.

47:25.340 --> 47:28.590
Just so you know, that shit
does not faze me at all.

47:29.003 --> 47:32.678
I am like the fucking Terminator, dude.
I am just going to keep coming after you.

47:33.090 --> 47:34.307
Just so we're clear.

47:34.307 --> 47:36.052
Good luck with that.

47:37.386 --> 47:40.230
Oh, shit. Check it out.

47:42.099 --> 47:43.442
I will be damned.

47:44.393 --> 47:45.440
That shit worked.

47:46.562 --> 47:47.859
Super fast.

47:55.946 --> 47:58.699
Wow. Thank you guys for
coming out. What a turnout.

47:59.200 --> 48:05.628
Right? I just want to take this opportunity
to thank the guys from Period 5

48:05.628 --> 48:09.878
for letting me join the band,
and also, I...

48:09.878 --> 48:15.137
I have an original song. it is my first 
crack at songwriting, so be kind.

48:15.758 --> 48:16.759
Um...

48:17.927 --> 48:20.806
And it goes out to
someone very special.

48:23.474 --> 48:28.480
# There was a girl I met some time ago

48:29.230 --> 48:30.982
# Simpatico

48:32.108 --> 48:35.908
# She helped me heal, she helped me grow

48:36.737 --> 48:38.159
# Simpatico

48:38.656 --> 48:43.412
# How do you know when you know?
I guess you just know

48:44.120 --> 48:45.497
# Simpatico

48:46.163 --> 48:50.669
# Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah,
woah, woah, woah, woah woah, woah

48:51.752 --> 48:52.753
# Woah

48:53.462 --> 48:55.180
# Simpatico

48:55.180 --> 48:59.014
# Exotico, erotico

48:59.927 --> 49:03.477
# You're my narcotico

49:04.181 --> 49:09.813
# Ask me how much I feel,
I will say, "A lotico"

49:11.439 --> 49:16.444
# There can never in the world be too much

49:16.444 --> 49:20.620
# Before I met you
I was a ship out at sea #

49:20.620 --> 49:23.042
Fuck. What, is it me?

49:23.451 --> 49:25.545
No, I... I mean, is there
something wrong with me?

49:25.545 --> 49:28.873
I don't think so. I mean, sometimes,
you talk to people in a...

49:28.873 --> 49:30.966
Thank you.
Forget him.

49:31.208 --> 49:33.381
At least now you can stop
worrying about him

49:33.381 --> 49:35.805
and be the best teacher you
can be. I mean, who knows?

49:35.805 --> 49:37.302
Maybe you will win the bonus.

49:39.383 --> 49:40.726
Fuck.

49:41.010 --> 49:43.308
What bonus? For the state test.

49:43.308 --> 49:48.564
Whichever teacher has the
highest-scoring class gets a bonus.

49:48.976 --> 49:51.946
How much? $5,700.

49:53.230 --> 49:55.403
Son of a bitch. $5,700?

49:55.403 --> 49:57.326
Yeah.
God damn it, Lynn.

49:57.735 --> 49:59.362
You never tell me anything.
Yeah.

50:05.910 --> 50:07.253
Come on.

50:07.912 --> 50:09.539
Come on, come on, come on.

50:10.748 --> 50:13.501
Let's go, we have a lot to go over.
Everybody sit down. Come on.

50:14.376 --> 50:15.548
Where's the TV?

50:15.920 --> 50:19.265
Now, everybody, open your To
Kill a Mockingbirds to page one.

50:21.258 --> 50:22.350
Good.

50:22.676 --> 50:24.929
Now who can tell me
why Jem cries

50:24.929 --> 50:26.935
when the hole in the tree
is filled with cement?

50:27.681 --> 50:29.058
Because she's a cry-baby?

50:30.601 --> 50:31.773
Get out.

50:36.106 --> 50:37.449
We're here to learn.

50:38.692 --> 50:40.114
Anybody else have
a problem with that?

50:42.029 --> 50:44.532
Good. Now, who has the answer
to my question?

50:47.451 --> 50:48.623
Nobody's read this book?

50:50.120 --> 50:51.212
It's on the syllabus.

50:51.212 --> 50:53.290
Well, you never
assigned it to us.

50:53.290 --> 50:55.130
Well, now I am.

50:55.130 --> 50:56.631
And we have a quiz tomorrow.

50:56.631 --> 50:57.799
What?

50:57.799 --> 50:59.300
On the first hundred pages.

51:03.551 --> 51:06.930
You can't do that.
I have band and jazz band tonight.

51:07.137 --> 51:08.730
We haven't had homework all year.

51:11.308 --> 51:16.155
Things are about to change
around here. Recess is over.

51:17.773 --> 51:19.320
Because birds symbolize freedom?

51:20.776 --> 51:22.244
Good. Good, okay.

51:22.244 --> 51:24.742
Does anyone have anything to add
to what that girl just said?

51:28.492 --> 51:31.666
So, what are the limitations of
having Scout as the narrator?

51:33.247 --> 51:35.966
You, Chubs. Because he...

51:39.795 --> 51:42.173
Focus. You know
this shit. Come on.

51:42.923 --> 51:44.095
Okay, go.

51:48.512 --> 51:49.934
Don't flinch. Seriously.

51:49.934 --> 51:51.436
You and you, hold his arms down.

51:53.350 --> 51:55.193
Next question. Come on.

51:55.644 --> 52:00.525
Because Atticus is always the
voice of reason and justice?

52:02.484 --> 52:04.031
Correct. Here.

52:05.529 --> 52:06.655
Nothing in the face.

52:07.865 --> 52:10.209
Woah. Wait.

52:11.368 --> 52:14.121
Miss Halsey. Really?

52:14.622 --> 52:16.215
Wow. I never.

52:16.540 --> 52:18.463
We're in the middle of a lesson.
Wow.

52:19.209 --> 52:23.214
Twilight, look at me.
What did we talk about in class?

52:25.007 --> 52:28.307
Your weight should be evenly distributed.
You got to throw off the back foot.

52:29.011 --> 52:31.230
Don't throw at her, throw through her.

52:31.230 --> 52:32.731
Hit her.

52:34.016 --> 52:35.063
Nail her.

52:36.894 --> 52:39.738
Hey, what do you think of me
with Jessica Simpson's tits?

52:40.064 --> 52:41.190
Go bigger.

52:43.192 --> 52:45.536
What do you think of me
with Pamela Anderson's tits?

52:45.903 --> 52:47.405
Go bigger.

52:50.824 --> 52:55.921
It's just so funny, because I...
I love raisins, and he hates raisins.

52:55.921 --> 52:57.498
Yin and yang.

52:57.748 --> 52:59.500
You guys are so cute.

52:59.833 --> 53:02.677
So cute.
it's like too cute, almost.

53:03.087 --> 53:04.760
Last weekend,
we went for a drive.

53:06.882 --> 53:09.601
We had no idea where
we were going.

53:09.601 --> 53:11.095
We left the maps at home.

53:11.428 --> 53:13.430
What? No way.

53:13.681 --> 53:16.230
It was fine.
I have a GPS navi system.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.147
Thank God.

53:18.147 --> 53:22.277
And we discovered
this new Ethiopian restaurant.

53:22.523 --> 53:25.276
They finally got their
own cuisine. Progress.

53:28.862 --> 53:31.456
Hey, Miss Halsey.
Hey.

53:31.949 --> 53:34.498
Your shirt's mis-buttoned.
Her shirt's mis-buttoned.

53:36.245 --> 53:38.247
Thank you, Amy,
for pointing that out.

53:38.247 --> 53:39.673
You're so welcome.

53:40.249 --> 53:42.968
God, I have just been...
Been such a mess this week, you know.

53:42.968 --> 53:44.920
Just working myself
to the bone.

53:45.337 --> 53:47.510
Yeah. It's been
quite a change.

53:47.756 --> 53:49.929
Well, I think it's great.
Yeah, it's great.

53:49.929 --> 53:52.720
I just love people who are so
passionate about what they do.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.347
It's so inspirational.

53:54.722 --> 53:55.939
Thanks.

53:55.939 --> 53:59.018
Yeah, you know, some teachers just
sail by doing that bare-minimum thing?

53:59.393 --> 54:00.690
I don't know,
it's just not me.

54:02.229 --> 54:04.527
It's good to know there's still
some actual educators out there.

54:07.443 --> 54:08.695
What else, Sasha?

54:09.194 --> 54:10.821
I think I have told
you everything.

54:10.821 --> 54:12.702
Anyone know
where Daddy Warbucks is?

54:12.702 --> 54:14.208
No more movies in class?

54:14.208 --> 54:16.292
No. We're actually learning.

54:16.292 --> 54:19.042
Hey, did you know that Animal Farm
isn't even really about animals?

54:19.747 --> 54:23.797
Animal Farm? Sasha, that's
not even on the syllabus.

54:24.293 --> 54:26.716
Yeah. I know
you're forgetting something.

54:29.298 --> 54:31.300
You want extra credit
on your diorama or not?

54:31.300 --> 54:33.385
I do, I want it.
Okay, think.

54:33.719 --> 54:35.221
Let me think.

54:36.430 --> 54:37.773
Well, there was...
What?

54:37.773 --> 54:39.399
Never mind.
What?

54:39.399 --> 54:41.227
Well, it was okay.
It was medicinal.

54:43.562 --> 54:44.563
Ah.

54:45.105 --> 54:49.326
And if she claims it's "medicinal", I
would demand to see a prescription.

54:49.943 --> 54:51.240
That's what I would do
if I were you, Wally.

54:51.737 --> 54:55.332
Do you have any proof other than
what one student thought she saw?

54:56.074 --> 55:01.331
Wall, this one student is in line to be
editor of The Daily Musket next year.

55:02.247 --> 55:04.249
She's got a lot to lose
going public with this.

55:04.458 --> 55:07.428
If the Teachers' Union found out
that I was administering a drug test

55:07.428 --> 55:11.349
to a teacher with this little proof, they
would make my life a living hell, Amy.

55:11.924 --> 55:13.176
So we're just going to
let her walk free?

55:13.967 --> 55:14.968
Huh?

55:15.260 --> 55:17.137
That's it? That's bonkers.

55:18.806 --> 55:19.932
Ame, Amy.

55:21.141 --> 55:23.985
Amy, stop that. Stop it.

55:23.985 --> 55:25.775
Sorry. Sorry.

55:25.775 --> 55:27.110
Sit down.

55:29.441 --> 55:30.488
Amy,

55:31.860 --> 55:34.909
do you see this beautiful,
little, glass dolphin figurine?

55:34.909 --> 55:37.207
Mmm-hmm.
Look at it.

55:37.658 --> 55:39.251
Yep.
Look at it.

55:39.251 --> 55:40.794
I am looking at it.

55:41.119 --> 55:42.621
Elizabeth gave this to me.

55:43.288 --> 55:46.838
She is a thoughtful young woman, and she
is teaching for all the right reasons.

55:46.838 --> 55:48.176
Wally.

55:48.836 --> 55:53.137
Can't you see she is manipulating
you through the use of dolphins?

55:53.137 --> 55:56.017
No, what I see is that
you are getting worked up.

55:56.301 --> 56:01.478
And what I would hate to see
is for you to get overwhelmed,

56:02.641 --> 56:04.314
like you did in 2008.

56:06.144 --> 56:08.488
Got you. Thanks, Wally,
for bringing that up.

56:10.816 --> 56:12.033
Forgotten all about that.

56:16.029 --> 56:17.326
Don't do that with your mouth.

56:19.700 --> 56:20.747
Regular mouth.

56:27.165 --> 56:29.714
Atticus Finch is a good lawyer

56:29.714 --> 56:32.967
because he's a good person who's a lawyer.

56:35.674 --> 56:39.679
Stupid point. Misspelled.

56:45.058 --> 56:47.857
Is this English?

56:52.900 --> 56:58.703
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:01.533 --> 57:02.580
Pathetic.

57:02.910 --> 57:06.130
This is why the Japs are overtaking us.
And, believe me, I don't mean you.

57:08.415 --> 57:10.417
But we're working
really hard.

57:12.044 --> 57:15.093
You're not working hard
enough. I need results.

57:15.339 --> 57:16.591
Class dismissed.

57:28.393 --> 57:29.690
I need that test.

57:37.819 --> 57:39.492
Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey.

57:40.072 --> 57:41.949
Unfortunately, I am not
going to make it in today.

57:42.157 --> 57:43.374
Tom Sawyer.

57:43.784 --> 57:47.834
My grandmother took a turn for the
worse and it looks like she's dead,

57:48.372 --> 57:50.875
so I am off to the funeral.
Wish me luck.

57:52.417 --> 57:53.839
Yo, Bitch Tits.

57:54.294 --> 57:57.173
I am not going to ask you again, dude.
I need those coupons mailed today.

57:57.714 --> 57:59.216
Consider it already done.

58:01.468 --> 58:03.436
Hi.
Back here. Come on.

58:05.764 --> 58:10.065
This is GHB. You take one
capful before you go to sleep.

58:10.268 --> 58:13.442
And you won't believe the difference
it will make in your workouts.

58:13.939 --> 58:16.533
You will look even more amazing.
What are the side effects?

58:17.067 --> 58:19.695
Diarrhea, heart palpitations,
nothing major.

58:20.195 --> 58:22.789
Just don't take it during the day,
you will be out like a light.

58:23.699 --> 58:25.076
Out like a light.

58:25.575 --> 58:27.498
Hey, Bitch Tits,
you send out those coupons?

58:27.744 --> 58:29.872
I was not told about
any coupons.

58:30.622 --> 58:33.626
Well, I can't wait
to get buff.

58:33.959 --> 58:37.509
How about you send me some JPEGs,
so I can monitor your progress?

58:37.509 --> 58:38.888
You got it, boss.

58:40.799 --> 58:43.052
Good afternoon,
illinois Standardized Testing.

58:43.052 --> 58:44.432
How may I direct
your call?

58:45.053 --> 58:46.805
Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman

58:46.805 --> 58:48.561
and I am calling from
The Chicago Tribune.

58:49.266 --> 58:50.563
Who could I speak to
regarding

58:50.563 --> 58:53.987
the allegations of racial bias
on your standardized tests?

58:54.730 --> 58:56.027
Please hold.

59:06.616 --> 59:07.708
Marjorie?

59:08.827 --> 59:09.874
You must be Carl.

59:11.204 --> 59:13.172
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

59:13.540 --> 59:14.917
Of course. Sure.

59:15.959 --> 59:18.678
Hey. So did you find the place okay?
It was a good drive?

59:18.678 --> 59:19.801
Great drive.

59:19.801 --> 59:22.804
Listen, Carl, I know
that you're a very busy man,

59:22.804 --> 59:24.851
so I am just going to
get right down to it.

59:25.427 --> 59:29.933
I have been speaking to
various black citizens

59:29.933 --> 59:34.521
who allege that your tests are biased
towards white people and Orientals.

59:34.978 --> 59:37.197
Okay. Let me tell you
something right away.

59:37.481 --> 59:39.575
A, Orientals test better.

59:40.484 --> 59:44.830
B, every couple of years, we
get these cockamamie charges

59:44.830 --> 59:46.703
coming in from various parts
of the state. Let me...

59:47.032 --> 59:48.830
You should hear the things
that they call me.

59:49.326 --> 59:52.956
Racist, I am fagatron,
I am faggy Hitler, dick-breath.

59:53.371 --> 59:56.170
Okay? But I am not a racist.

59:56.708 --> 59:59.427
I voted for Obama.
You can quote me on that in your article.

59:59.427 --> 01:00:01.213
You know what I think
would help, Carl?

01:00:02.214 --> 01:00:04.433
For me to see one
of this year's tests.

01:00:04.433 --> 01:00:07.769
Oh. Sure, I can get you one easy.
No problem.

01:00:07.769 --> 01:00:09.141
Great. Great.

01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:11.474
On the day after the
schools administer them,

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.558
I will shoot one
right over to you.

01:00:14.059 --> 01:00:16.903
I was hoping to see it sooner.
I am on a bit of a deadline.

01:00:17.229 --> 01:00:19.778
So, no, that is absolutely
classified, unless...

01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:22.116
Unless you have one of these
bad boys right here.

01:00:22.526 --> 01:00:24.904
Wow. You know, Carl?

01:00:25.904 --> 01:00:28.282
Enough business for one night.
Don't you think?

01:00:28.282 --> 01:00:29.783
Tell me about it. Yeah.

01:00:30.075 --> 01:00:32.419
I think I am going to have another
drink before I hit the road.

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.419
You know, it's like the freedom and
the wind in your hair, and the...

01:00:36.419 --> 01:00:38.634
Obviously, the image
that I want to...

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.220
But then the other side is,
like, mopeds are scary, so I...

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.098
Count me out. But you seem
like such a wild man, Carl.

01:00:45.098 --> 01:00:47.499
Yeah, I mean.......

01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:49.933
What turns you on, Carl?

01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:53.644
Everything.

01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.768
You want to know
what turns me on?

01:00:56.893 --> 01:00:58.611
Sex in an office.

01:00:59.104 --> 01:01:02.108
Getting fucked really hard
against a wooden desk.

01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:05.944
Mine's metal.

01:01:06.236 --> 01:01:07.283
Even better.

01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:11.583
And voila. So...

01:01:14.744 --> 01:01:15.961
This is the desk.

01:01:17.497 --> 01:01:18.919
Do you have anything
to drink?

01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:22.302
Yes, I do.

01:01:24.754 --> 01:01:25.801
Voila.

01:01:25.801 --> 01:01:29.636
Ooh. White wine in
the office. Bad boy.

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:31.978
Do you have any music, Carl?

01:01:32.429 --> 01:01:33.601
I have the Internet radio.

01:01:34.014 --> 01:01:36.642
I love Internet radio.

01:01:37.684 --> 01:01:41.188
You have come to the right
place, because I have that.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:45.783
See, I am not a whiz
at this computer here.

01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:49.454
It's relatively new,
and Grace, who is...

01:01:50.488 --> 01:01:53.287
...works with me on Mondays
and Wednesdays, and Thursdays,

01:01:53.287 --> 01:01:55.960
and I share her with
Greg across the way.

01:01:56.494 --> 01:01:59.498
Greg, across the hall, is actually
the guy who got me into spinning.

01:02:00.165 --> 01:02:01.212
Oh, here we go.

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.013
Shall we toast?

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:10.137
To new friends.
And new lovers.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:19.351
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:27.484 --> 01:02:29.486
I am going to take off my shoes.
Is that okay? Whatever, man.

01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:31.697
I am going to go hit the ladies' room.
Okay.

01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:33.448
There's a handicapped one,
it's way closer.

01:02:33.448 --> 01:02:34.916
Use the handicapped one,
it's way closer.

01:03:02.727 --> 01:03:04.195
I took off
my shoes.

01:03:04.195 --> 01:03:05.693
Oh, Carl.

01:03:06.022 --> 01:03:08.946
I want to fuck you up
against the desk.

01:03:08.946 --> 01:03:10.865
I want to fuck you
against the desk.

01:03:10.865 --> 01:03:13.538
Carl, I am going to need you
to pass the fuck out.

01:03:13.538 --> 01:03:19.746
Marjorie. I am going to
rock your vagina.

01:03:21.955 --> 01:03:26.756
That wine is good.
Marjorie, let's do this.

01:03:27.252 --> 01:03:28.595
Fuck me.

01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:36.770
Hello, titties.

01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:43.982
If anyone has any information
regarding the missing Annie wig,

01:03:43.982 --> 01:03:46.104
please let me know ASAP.

01:03:47.147 --> 01:03:49.900
Come on, guys.
There's a wig missing.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.702
Because if that wig isn't found,

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:56.623
you can bet your bottom dollar, the
sun will not come out tomorrow.

01:03:58.158 --> 01:04:01.378
Back to you, Wally.
Okay. Thank you, Amy.

01:04:01.378 --> 01:04:03.626
I am sure everybody wants to get
home, so I am going to be quick.

01:04:03.626 --> 01:04:06.421
Four score and
seven years ago...

01:04:12.422 --> 01:04:15.801
God damn it, Sandy.
Sandy's so funny.

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:22.190
I have here the results
of the state exam.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:26.733
And I am happy to announce that the
John Adams Middle School, that's us,

01:04:26.733 --> 01:04:29.155
scored in the top 5% of the whole state.

01:04:32.484 --> 01:04:33.656
Nice.

01:04:33.656 --> 01:04:35.495
Good job, guys.

01:04:36.154 --> 01:04:39.158
And I want to single
out one of our own

01:04:39.158 --> 01:04:42.252
who showed that
with hard work and dedication,

01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:45.672
one teacher can make a difference.

01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:49.589
And this teacher is now $5,700 richer,

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:54.298
with the highest scores in Cook
County, that's the whole county,

01:04:55.006 --> 01:04:58.260
I want everyone to give
a big round of applause

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.515
to Elizabeth Halsey.

01:05:07.185 --> 01:05:08.778
Well done.
Thank you.

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:15.201
Congratulations, Miss Halsey.

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:17.112
Thanks, dude.

01:05:18.863 --> 01:05:21.286
Well, if it isn't
Professor Smartypants.

01:05:21.286 --> 01:05:23.619
Don't mess with me.
I am a lot stronger than I look.

01:05:24.327 --> 01:05:29.379
Hey. Elizabeth,
I am so proud of you.

01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:33.132
I mean, if someone told me at the
beginning of the year that you...

01:05:33.132 --> 01:05:35.305
You would get the bonus,

01:05:35.305 --> 01:05:41.478
well, I think I would have said to whomever
it was, "No way. Absolutely not."

01:05:41.478 --> 01:05:45.308
And now, here we are.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.018
We should go out and
celebrate. Your treat?

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.858
Yeah, unfortunately,
Elizabeth,

01:05:50.858 --> 01:05:54.362
Scott and I have to go over the
itinerary for the Springfield trip.

01:05:54.732 --> 01:05:57.531
Yeah. We're the chaperones,
we're going together.

01:05:58.736 --> 01:06:01.865
We're dating, so it will
also be romantic.

01:06:02.532 --> 01:06:04.626
How fun.
Yeah.

01:06:04.626 --> 01:06:06.078
You're not seeing
anyone now, right?

01:06:06.619 --> 01:06:09.418
Got my eye on someone,
but he's dating a major cunt.

01:06:11.374 --> 01:06:12.717
Pardon my French.

01:06:12.717 --> 01:06:15.220
No, no.
She sounds terrible.

01:06:16.713 --> 01:06:19.262
Almost done.

01:06:20.049 --> 01:06:21.676
Okay, so that's endorsed.

01:06:21.676 --> 01:06:23.557
And put the rest on these.

01:06:25.305 --> 01:06:27.854
Split it.
All righty.

01:06:27.854 --> 01:06:29.058
Book it.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.302
Okay.

01:06:56.628 --> 01:06:58.972
Take your seat. Thank you.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.052
Who did this?

01:07:05.386 --> 01:07:06.387
Aw.

01:07:06.387 --> 01:07:08.269
Come on.

01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:10.726
No one wants an extra sticker
on their all-star board?

01:07:11.643 --> 01:07:16.023
Who brought you to me, Mr. Apple?

01:07:16.023 --> 01:07:18.570
Ooh. Ah, ah, ah.

01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:22.199
What was that, Mr. Apple?

01:07:23.446 --> 01:07:25.619
You want me to take a bite?

01:07:26.324 --> 01:07:27.917
All righty-roo.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.793
Mmm.

01:07:33.122 --> 01:07:35.591
And, Elizabeth, I just want to thank
you again for stepping in today.

01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:38.011
You really saved us here.
No problem.

01:07:38.011 --> 01:07:39.338
Hey, is Amy going to be okay?

01:07:39.338 --> 01:07:41.013
Yeah, Amy's going to be fine.

01:07:41.013 --> 01:07:42.716
Well, let her know
she's in my thoughts.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.648
# Hey, Arkady

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:52.566
# Someone's calling my name

01:07:52.892 --> 01:07:54.360
# Hey, Arkady #

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.856
I dare you. I am not afraid
of your dares, Rodrigo.

01:07:59.232 --> 01:08:00.654
Do it.

01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:04.571
That's really dangerous,
Russell.

01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:07.748
I will call you from the hotel.
Bye, Amy.

01:08:08.533 --> 01:08:10.376
Yeah, she's sitting
right next to me.

01:08:10.994 --> 01:08:13.372
No.
Thanks for calling again.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:19.386
Amy says hi.
Wow, she sure calls a lot.

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:22.087
So, are you excited
about your surgery?

01:08:23.423 --> 01:08:25.390
I have never been more
excited about anything.

01:08:26.134 --> 01:08:28.136
It's a pretty inspiring
message to the kids.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:31.098
We should never stop
working on ourselves.

01:08:32.348 --> 01:08:36.603
Like you with your little boobs or
me experimenting with ethnic food.

01:09:19.395 --> 01:09:22.569
Gosh. I never lose my keys.

01:09:23.858 --> 01:09:25.701
Such a ding-a-ling.

01:09:26.653 --> 01:09:27.779
What's wrong with your face?

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.322
What is wrong with your face?

01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:32.580
Hey, I am just trying
to make conversation.

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:35.920
You're all done.
Super. Thanks a bunch, Amos.

01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:47.055
I knew it.

01:09:56.349 --> 01:09:57.350
Huh.

01:09:59.727 --> 01:10:03.231
Well, that is definitely Marjorie,
only with kind of weird hair here.

01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:05.066
In real life, she's
actually very pretty.

01:10:05.066 --> 01:10:07.277
She in some kind of trouble?
Marjorie?

01:10:07.985 --> 01:10:10.613
I think you're the one who might
be in some kind of trouble.

01:10:11.114 --> 01:10:14.414
Did you or did you not give
her a copy of the state test?

01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:19.794
No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:23.589
No, I did give her some
quotes for her article.

01:10:24.001 --> 01:10:25.173
What article?

01:10:25.173 --> 01:10:27.847
Her article for the Tribune.
She's a reporter there, right?

01:10:32.719 --> 01:10:35.518
Test tampering? At JAMS?

01:10:35.518 --> 01:10:39.191
This time I have a witness, and, like I
said, Wally, she stole the Annie wig.

01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:41.940
We're dealing with
a criminal mastermind.

01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:48.285
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Wall.
You know how much we all love her.

01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:53.368
Okay, well, you Know, I have
to call the superintendent.

01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:56.873
We're going to have to crosscheck
her entire class's scores.

01:10:57.118 --> 01:10:59.792
This is a real shit sandwich.

01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:02.674
Of course, you know
what scares me the most, Wall?

01:11:02.674 --> 01:11:05.009
This is just what
we know, right?

01:11:05.626 --> 01:11:08.345
Who knows what else
she's capable of?

01:11:11.799 --> 01:11:14.052
It's so awful.

01:11:21.559 --> 01:11:23.152
Fruit Roll-Up?

01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:26.026
You know, when President
Lincoln abolished slavery,

01:11:26.026 --> 01:11:28.149
it was not a popular opinion.

01:11:28.441 --> 01:11:29.442
Hmm.

01:11:29.442 --> 01:11:32.654
God, I just hate
slavery so, so much.

01:11:33.488 --> 01:11:35.866
Slavery's the worst.

01:11:35.866 --> 01:11:40.416
If I could go back in time
and undo slavery, I would.

01:11:41.662 --> 01:11:42.754
I hate it.

01:11:43.998 --> 01:11:45.796
Hey, I am sorry to interrupt, guys,

01:11:45.796 --> 01:11:49.049
but I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

01:11:49.049 --> 01:11:50.763
Can I tell you guys what I hate?

01:11:51.339 --> 01:11:52.966
Sharks.

01:11:52.966 --> 01:11:56.178
Well, sharks can tear families apart.

01:11:56.886 --> 01:11:58.354
But they're also so majestic.

01:11:58.679 --> 01:12:00.431
They are beautiful creatures.

01:12:00.431 --> 01:12:01.767
But they're also so ferocious.

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.355
So ferocious.

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:06.946
One of nature's
cruel jokes, I guess.

01:12:08.064 --> 01:12:09.361
Okay.

01:12:12.026 --> 01:12:14.620
Thank you, Elizabeth,
for listening.

01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:18.791
Scott, I want you to know you
can talk to me about anything.

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:43.307
Your jeans feel so
good against my jeans.

01:12:44.267 --> 01:12:45.644
Totally.

01:12:46.394 --> 01:12:48.442
Hey, your body feels so good.

01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:50.569
I need some water.

01:13:13.504 --> 01:13:14.756
I am dry-humping
the shit out of you.

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:17.809
Yeah, dry-fuck the fuck
out of me, Scott.

01:13:18.092 --> 01:13:19.139
Just stop talking.

01:13:22.763 --> 01:13:25.482
I have been fantasizing about this
ever since we got to Springfield.

01:13:26.809 --> 01:13:28.277
This?
Oh, yeah.

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:32.691
Me, too.

01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:36.152
I am close.

01:13:36.819 --> 01:13:38.492
Don't move.

01:13:39.488 --> 01:13:40.990
Here I go.

01:13:41.824 --> 01:13:43.041
Almost.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:45.332
Wait for it.

01:13:47.663 --> 01:13:49.336
Really close. Ready?

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:51.834
Yeah.
Just stop talking.

01:13:53.044 --> 01:13:56.014
Oh, yeah. Almost there.

01:14:06.682 --> 01:14:09.356
That was great.
More like amazing.

01:14:10.186 --> 01:14:12.905
Well, I am going to get going.

01:14:12.905 --> 01:14:15.116
I don't want the kids to
see me leaving your room.

01:14:15.116 --> 01:14:16.568
Yeah.

01:14:17.234 --> 01:14:18.360
God.

01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:21.246
We are so simpatico.

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:26.164
Maybe next time, we can dry-hump
without our clothes on.

01:14:26.702 --> 01:14:29.376
I am pretty sure I'd like that.
Yeah.

01:14:38.047 --> 01:14:42.553
Even your forehead is sexy.
Well, time for bed.

01:14:44.971 --> 01:14:46.894
All right, then.

01:14:47.264 --> 01:14:48.857
See you in the manana.

01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:53.397
Elizabeth, don't let
the bedbugs bite.

01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:03.405
Hey.

01:15:04.281 --> 01:15:05.328
Hey.

01:15:05.328 --> 01:15:08.287
I was just going over some
stuff for tomorrow.

01:15:09.078 --> 01:15:10.625
Yeah, cool.

01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:13.378
I am serious.

01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:15.338
Okay.

01:15:16.419 --> 01:15:17.671
Cheers.

01:15:18.754 --> 01:15:20.097
Hey.

01:15:20.923 --> 01:15:24.803
They forgot to restock my mini bar.
How's yours looking?

01:15:25.845 --> 01:15:29.065
You know what, I am super tired.
I am just going to hit the sack.

01:15:29.807 --> 01:15:30.808
Oh.

01:15:31.267 --> 01:15:32.484
I will see you tomorrow, then.

01:15:32.685 --> 01:15:33.686
Good night.

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:39.112
And 17.

01:15:41.068 --> 01:15:42.695
All done.

01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.406
Shelly?

01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:48.034
Oh, Shelly, someone's
got a message.

01:15:51.579 --> 01:15:53.377
I am dry-humping
the shit out of you.

01:15:53.377 --> 01:15:55.379
Yeah, dry-fuck
the fuck out of me, Scott.

01:15:58.294 --> 01:16:01.798
I wasn't
always president. Oh, no.

01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:05.886
I had many jobs
when I lived here in New Salem.

01:16:05.886 --> 01:16:10.974
My fav... My
favorite job was splitting rails,

01:16:11.474 --> 01:16:13.977
which is why
they called me Railsplitter.

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:15.311
Uh...

01:16:16.062 --> 01:16:19.487
Anybody know any of
my other nicknames?

01:16:20.066 --> 01:16:22.114
Honest Abe.
Yes.

01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:26.823
Obviously. Honest Abe.
That was the big one. Honest Abe.

01:16:26.823 --> 01:16:30.331
They always called me that because
I said what was on my mind.

01:16:30.868 --> 01:16:32.962
Even if it made me unpopular.

01:16:33.579 --> 01:16:39.632
Remember, a great man always has the
courage to say what is in his heart.

01:16:41.337 --> 01:16:42.589
Yeah?

01:16:45.174 --> 01:16:47.268
I love Chase Rubin-Rossi.

01:16:49.512 --> 01:16:50.684
Great.

01:16:51.764 --> 01:16:54.643
Who would like to see Mary Todd churn butter?
Churn butter?

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:57.854
I love you, Chase.
I want to yell it from the mountaintops.

01:16:58.729 --> 01:17:02.279
And even though you pretty much
stopped talking to me in fifth grade,

01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:04.360
I don't care.

01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:09.116
I remember the Chase that wrote me
a card when my dad was overweight

01:17:09.116 --> 01:17:11.075
and had to go to the hospital
because of his heart.

01:17:12.243 --> 01:17:15.622
And a year later when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer,

01:17:15.622 --> 01:17:18.753
you wrote me another card.
What happened to us?

01:17:20.251 --> 01:17:24.222
Remember in the second grade when we
had a sleepover and you wet the bed,

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.969
and you were so embarrassed?

01:17:25.969 --> 01:17:29.052
And you made me promise
never to tell anyone?

01:17:29.052 --> 01:17:32.059
Well, I never have
and I never will.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:36.730
So there it is.
My heart on a sleeve.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:40.063
Don't let me leave.
No, please, don't.

01:17:40.063 --> 01:17:42.695
Always believe.

01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:45.693
Gross.

01:17:47.319 --> 01:17:51.749
- Loser. Dork.
- Hey. All right, guys.

01:17:51.749 --> 01:17:53.542
Come on, settle down. Okay.

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:56.291
Let's see how Mary Todd's
doing with that butter.

01:17:57.329 --> 01:17:59.878
Okay, that's enough.
We get it, you're crying.

01:17:59.878 --> 01:18:02.585
She just laughed at me and called me gross.

01:18:02.585 --> 01:18:06.047
Well, yeah, did you hear your speech?
Come on, let's go back.

01:18:06.047 --> 01:18:07.848
No. No, I am not going back.

01:18:07.848 --> 01:18:10.221
Come on.
Just leave me alone.

01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:12.057
Shit.

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:13.854
Garrett.

01:18:17.349 --> 01:18:19.147
Get your ass back here.

01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.534
We done running?

01:18:30.534 --> 01:18:32.081
Everything okay in here?

01:18:32.364 --> 01:18:34.992
It's okay. I am his teacher.

01:18:34.992 --> 01:18:37.248
Okay. Take your time.

01:18:38.162 --> 01:18:41.336
She's never going to like me, is she?
Are we still on this?

01:18:41.336 --> 01:18:42.883
She's my everything.

01:18:45.252 --> 01:18:48.677
Okay, here's the deal, man.
I cannot keep sugar-coating this for you.

01:18:48.677 --> 01:18:53.227
This girl is never going to be
interested in you. Never.

01:18:53.227 --> 01:18:58.650
You clearly have a rich interior life,
with the poems and the whatever,

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:02.228
but she wants a guy like
Ian what's-his-face.

01:19:02.228 --> 01:19:05.656
Ian Mendelbaum, the
rapper? He's an idiot.

01:19:05.656 --> 01:19:09.201
Yeah, he's a fucking moron.
But she doesn't care.

01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:12.906
She's superficial and her
priorities are all fucked up.

01:19:14.907 --> 01:19:17.535
She likes him because
he's hot and popular, dude.

01:19:17.535 --> 01:19:20.588
You are sensitive.

01:19:20.913 --> 01:19:22.506
Yes, thank you.

01:19:22.506 --> 01:19:24.375
It's not a compliment.

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:25.459
Oh.

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:29.221
You have some rough road ahead of you.
Seventh grade is not your moment.

01:19:29.755 --> 01:19:31.974
Yeah. Eighth grade
will be better.

01:19:31.974 --> 01:19:33.426
Probably not.

01:19:33.426 --> 01:19:37.889
I am thinking college.
That's your window. Be ready.

01:19:42.309 --> 01:19:45.153
If I go back out there,
everyone's going to laugh at me.

01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:55.285
Maybe this will help.

01:19:55.285 --> 01:19:56.490
What are you doing?

01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:57.950
I am giving you a gift.

01:19:59.034 --> 01:20:00.035
Woah.

01:20:00.452 --> 01:20:03.251
We are going to change
the news cycle.

01:20:05.165 --> 01:20:06.337
Trust me on this.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.343
I thought it would be heavier.
Don't be weird.

01:20:12.343 --> 01:20:14.391
And take this off, and never
fucking wear it again.

01:20:14.391 --> 01:20:16.218
What, are you crazy?

01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:22.603
Everything okay with Garrett?

01:20:22.603 --> 01:20:23.775
No, it's not.

01:20:24.393 --> 01:20:27.237
I found him hooking up with an
eighth grader from another school.

01:20:27.237 --> 01:20:30.032
She was jerking him off.
Yeah.

01:20:30.032 --> 01:20:31.905
I am going to give him detention
when we get back.

01:20:32.526 --> 01:20:34.403
That's probably a good idea.
Yeah.

01:20:34.737 --> 01:20:37.456
Garrett probably made out with a
kid from an all boys' school.

01:20:37.456 --> 01:20:39.954
Yeah. And he was
wearing this.

01:20:40.617 --> 01:20:43.291
What?
Awesome.

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.999
- Yep. it's real.
- Let me see it.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.753
That's a nice thing
you did.

01:20:51.587 --> 01:20:54.181
I don't know what you're
talking about. Really?

01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:57.556
Because I couldn't help but notice
that you're not wearing a bra.

01:20:58.302 --> 01:21:01.932
And those kids over there
are playing with one.

01:21:02.723 --> 01:21:04.145
Lots of people
don't wear bras.

01:21:04.145 --> 01:21:06.527
Definitely. Lots of teachers.

01:21:07.519 --> 01:21:10.398
Well, if you must know, I was helping
a student through a tough time.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:14.657
I am going through such a tough time.
Can I have your panties?

01:21:15.069 --> 01:21:16.912
I am not wearing any.

01:21:26.872 --> 01:21:28.419
Amy. What are you doing here?

01:21:28.419 --> 01:21:29.751
Scott, talk to the hand.

01:21:31.126 --> 01:21:35.927
Amy.
I know everything.

01:21:36.757 --> 01:21:39.351
Carl Halabi?
The state test?

01:21:39.351 --> 01:21:41.520
The blatant disregard
for the school syllabus?

01:21:42.388 --> 01:21:45.312
And let's not forget, the
sleeping with my boyfriend.

01:21:47.351 --> 01:21:49.445
Scott, your phone accidentally
called me last night.

01:21:51.021 --> 01:21:54.901
I can't believe you'd let her
take advantage of you like that.

01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:57.611
You are too trusting.

01:21:58.028 --> 01:21:59.120
I am.

01:21:59.446 --> 01:22:00.993
I didn't know what was happening.

01:22:00.993 --> 01:22:02.825
I hope you haven't spent
that bonus check or anything,

01:22:02.825 --> 01:22:04.285
because you're about to give it back.

01:22:04.285 --> 01:22:09.670
And then some.
Jail time. Jail time.

01:22:10.332 --> 01:22:13.302
Did you ever think that maybe...
Save it, doll face.

01:22:13.302 --> 01:22:17.678
You can explain it all tomorrow to the
principal and the superintendent,

01:22:17.678 --> 01:22:19.508
when you have got your meeting
with the principal

01:22:19.508 --> 01:22:22.970
and the superintendent
tomorrow, at the meeting.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.063
Tomorrow.

01:22:34.857 --> 01:22:37.701
I need you to go to this guy's
office and scare the shit out of him.

01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:41.330
Tell me
my mission again.

01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:43.123
Hand him the envelope.

01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:45.121
I am going to need a
couple bucks for gas.

01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:51.623
And a couple bucks for snacks.

01:22:56.628 --> 01:22:59.973
# You're in for a surprise

01:22:59.973 --> 01:23:02.767
# You're in for a shock

01:23:03.802 --> 01:23:06.271
# In London town streets

01:23:06.638 --> 01:23:09.938
# When there's darkness and fog

01:23:10.309 --> 01:23:13.108
# When you least expect me

01:23:13.854 --> 01:23:16.607
# And you turn your...... #

01:23:16.607 --> 01:23:17.859
Oh, my God.

01:23:18.817 --> 01:23:21.366
Sir? Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:23:21.366 --> 01:23:23.163
I think I fucked up my knee.

01:23:23.163 --> 01:23:24.949
Okay. Easy, easy does it.

01:23:24.949 --> 01:23:27.034
Easy. Easy.
Hey.

01:23:27.659 --> 01:23:28.751
Do you need an ambulance?

01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:31.205
An ambulance is not necessary.
I just want to walk it off.

01:23:31.205 --> 01:23:33.711
Okay, walking on it's number one
worst thing you could probably do.

01:23:36.627 --> 01:23:38.971
Please don't touch my mirror.
Please, sir.

01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:41.765
What the fuck?
Who does that?

01:23:41.765 --> 01:23:43.968
I am a friend of Marjorie's.
Yeah.

01:23:45.219 --> 01:23:46.311
A friend of Marjorie's?

01:23:46.311 --> 01:23:47.808
Well, then fuck you, man.
Hey.

01:23:47.808 --> 01:23:49.811
No, shit, fuck you.
No, fuck you.

01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:51.233
Fuck you.
You like that?

01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:52.525
Stop kicking it. Stop.

01:23:52.525 --> 01:23:55.275
You stop fucking kicking it.
Fuck your scooter, and fuck Marjorie.

01:23:55.275 --> 01:23:57.106
She drugged me,
and she stole from me,

01:23:57.106 --> 01:23:58.907
and she's going down.
Let me think.

01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:08.246
Take it.
Go ahead and open it.

01:24:09.284 --> 01:24:10.376
Open it.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.586
Yeah, not bad for a camera phone, huh?
You can keep those, too.

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:18.920
Fuck.

01:24:19.836 --> 01:24:22.214
And I was never here,
you hear me?

01:24:22.714 --> 01:24:23.886
Fuck.

01:24:26.093 --> 01:24:27.891
Don't...
Stop fucking with my car.

01:24:33.225 --> 01:24:34.477
They're ready for you.

01:24:37.896 --> 01:24:39.944
"Learning is Fun-tastic."

01:24:41.024 --> 01:24:42.367
What'd you say to me?

01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:43.443
Your desk.

01:24:47.698 --> 01:24:49.951
Yeah. I forgot that was there.

01:24:51.118 --> 01:24:53.086
I am such a ditz sometimes.

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:58.004
This is very, very bad, Elizabeth.

01:24:58.004 --> 01:25:00.882
Incredibly, very bad, Elizabeth.

01:25:00.882 --> 01:25:02.550
Amy, you said you wouldn't speak.
That doesn't sound like observing.

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:03.630
Amy, you said you wouldn't speak.
That doesn't sound like observing.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.966
Bring him in.

01:25:14.016 --> 01:25:17.566
Mr. Halabi. Thank you for your time.
You're most welcome.

01:25:17.978 --> 01:25:21.482
I guess I should begin
by saying that my statement

01:25:21.482 --> 01:25:24.990
from earlier in the week
was not true.

01:25:26.612 --> 01:25:28.614
What part of it,
exactly?

01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.118
All of it. Pretty much.

01:25:33.201 --> 01:25:35.454
I have never seen this
woman before in my life.

01:25:35.454 --> 01:25:36.834
Baloney.

01:25:36.834 --> 01:25:39.632
You seemed very certain
a couple of days ago.

01:25:40.334 --> 01:25:41.677
I did, because...

01:25:43.086 --> 01:25:44.087
Uh...

01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:51.141
I am a casual drug user.
That's my thing and everybody knows it.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.647
So that explains me making
absolutely no sense.

01:25:59.978 --> 01:26:01.571
Thank you.

01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:05.493
You realize that if we find out you're
lying, you're going to lose your job?

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.035
Plus jail time.

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:08.407
Yes, I understand.

01:26:09.363 --> 01:26:14.039
I just don't want to see
an innocent teacher get hurt.

01:26:14.618 --> 01:26:15.790
Thank you, sir.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:20.170
I don't want to see anybody get hurt.

01:26:29.091 --> 01:26:30.934
What the hell was that?

01:26:30.934 --> 01:26:32.519
So there you go.

01:26:32.519 --> 01:26:33.937
I guess that explains everything.

01:26:33.937 --> 01:26:38.643
Retest. Retest. Retest.
Damn it, Squirrel.

01:26:38.643 --> 01:26:42.070
I am not going to have a repeat of 2008.
Sit your ass down.

01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:46.612
A retest, Don?

01:26:46.612 --> 01:26:50.242
Come on, do we really want to tell our
young people that if they study,

01:26:50.242 --> 01:26:53.699
sacrifice, and achieve the
highest scores in the state,

01:26:53.699 --> 01:26:56.501
that they're rewarded
with suspicion?

01:26:58.161 --> 01:27:03.292
I don't. I find these kinds
of accusations troubling.

01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:06.219
And, quite frankly, reckless.

01:27:07.337 --> 01:27:11.843
I work my ass off for this school,
and I know I am not perfect.

01:27:11.843 --> 01:27:15.725
But show me the
perfect teacher. You can't.

01:27:15.725 --> 01:27:20.401
There are even teachers in this
very school who use drugs.

01:27:21.435 --> 01:27:23.358
They do. They do use drugs.

01:27:23.358 --> 01:27:25.235
They do. They do.

01:27:25.235 --> 01:27:26.530
They do.

01:27:26.857 --> 01:27:28.325
Wally, do you remember how I told you

01:27:28.325 --> 01:27:32.200
there are teachers here
who use and abuse drugs?

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.579
God damn it.
And I am hearing about this now?

01:27:41.163 --> 01:27:42.915
What is it, Axel?
Where is it, boy?

01:27:42.915 --> 01:27:44.500
No, no, no.
That's my class.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.460
Axel's barking up the wrong tree there.

01:27:46.752 --> 01:27:49.005
Ma'am. Please, don't touch the dog.

01:27:49.005 --> 01:27:51.139
Your dog is mistaken.

01:27:52.799 --> 01:27:54.176
What do you got, Axel?

01:27:54.176 --> 01:27:56.102
He's not going to find anything in here.

01:28:02.267 --> 01:28:05.487
It's clean. Ha. I told you.

01:28:05.937 --> 01:28:07.405
Maybe there's a false bottom.

01:28:19.618 --> 01:28:21.120
That is not mine.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.252
This.... This....
This isn't even my desk. It's hers.

01:28:25.252 --> 01:28:27.881
Don't worry, Amy.
We will get you the help you need.

01:28:31.171 --> 01:28:34.015
You monster.
Whoa, lady.

01:28:34.549 --> 01:28:37.302
Calm down, lady.
Fucking damn it.

01:28:37.302 --> 01:28:41.106
What the fuck?
I stole her desk.

01:28:41.106 --> 01:28:46.403
You can check my urine.
Check it. Check my urine.

01:28:47.029 --> 01:28:51.029
Well, it's been another
great year here at JAMS.

01:28:51.399 --> 01:28:52.742
With summer around the corner,

01:28:52.742 --> 01:28:55.321
it's time to say goodbye not
only to another school year,

01:28:55.321 --> 01:28:57.576
but also to one of our own.

01:28:58.615 --> 01:29:00.288
Amy Squirrel.

01:29:00.288 --> 01:29:05.373
After six short years, Amy is
transferring out of the district.

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:07.048
Speech, speech. Well...

01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:13.139
Uh, Wally, thank you for those
kind words, and thank you all.

01:29:13.505 --> 01:29:17.681
My decision that I made myself
to leave was super difficult,

01:29:17.681 --> 01:29:22.515
but when the superintendent personally asks
you to work at one of the worst schools

01:29:22.515 --> 01:29:26.602
in the state, well,
you say, "Yes."

01:29:27.602 --> 01:29:32.699
And, boy, I am looking forward to
bringing my brand of zany energy

01:29:32.699 --> 01:29:36.404
to those underprivileged students
at Malcolm X High School.

01:29:38.572 --> 01:29:39.869
Thank you.

01:29:40.949 --> 01:29:46.251
Hey, Elizabeth. Listen,
since Amy's transferring,

01:29:46.251 --> 01:29:48.673
maybe the two of us
can start over.

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.843
Hey, there. Scott Delacorte.
And you are?

01:29:57.257 --> 01:29:58.804
Leaving.

01:30:15.275 --> 01:30:16.652
Elizabeth.

01:30:17.903 --> 01:30:19.075
Here.

01:30:20.614 --> 01:30:23.663
Sign my yearbook.
Hold my ball sack.

01:30:25.536 --> 01:30:31.167
I am going to write my number down just in
case you need a lift after the surgery

01:30:31.167 --> 01:30:32.842
or just, like, an extra
set of hands to make sure

01:30:32.842 --> 01:30:34.591
the implants are
settling properly.

01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:36.137
Thanks.

01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:39.762
Hey, you're not going to teach
again next year, are you?

01:30:39.762 --> 01:30:42.185
I don't know.
It's the only thing I am good at.

01:30:42.185 --> 01:30:45.730
I am just saying maybe you should
consider doing something else.

01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:49.560
Like, anything else.
Like, any other job in the entire world.

01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.311
Hmm.

01:30:52.604 --> 01:30:57.735
You know, the two of us?
It's never going to happen.

01:30:58.693 --> 01:31:01.287
Clearly.
I mean, how would that even work?

01:31:01.287 --> 01:31:03.365
Where do you even live?

01:31:03.365 --> 01:31:05.701
In some weird apartment
with some creepy roommate?

01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:10.255
No, my creepy roommate moved out,
so now it's just me and the dogs.

01:31:10.789 --> 01:31:12.291
How many dogs do you have?
Four.

01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:13.842
Four dogs? Yeah.

01:31:13.842 --> 01:31:15.169
Four Dobermans.

01:31:15.543 --> 01:31:18.137
Any family money? Yeah, you bet.

01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:22.593
We're talking like three figures.
Almost 700 bucks.

01:31:23.718 --> 01:31:27.188
So, basically, if I was going to go out with
you, I would be making the conscious choice

01:31:27.188 --> 01:31:30.938
to be dating a gym teacher who
lives in a shack with four dogs.

01:31:31.476 --> 01:31:35.982
I prefer to think of it as two
people with amazing bodies

01:31:35.982 --> 01:31:38.442
sharing those bodies
with each other.

01:31:39.567 --> 01:31:41.490
Giving each other
the gift of these bodies.

01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:46.704
Anyway, actually,
none of this really matters.

01:31:47.575 --> 01:31:50.294
I sort of started
seeing somebody.

01:31:50.745 --> 01:31:51.746
Oh.

01:31:53.623 --> 01:31:57.719
Really? Congratulations.
I didn't realize that, so...

01:31:58.169 --> 01:32:00.513
Yeah.
I feel stupid.

01:32:00.755 --> 01:32:02.257
So...
I am just fucking with you.

01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:06.478
I guess I deserved
that one.

01:32:06.478 --> 01:32:08.021
Yeah, you most certainly did.

01:32:08.513 --> 01:32:12.393
I think it's about time you realize
that the whole world doesn't just...

01:32:20.859 --> 01:32:22.076
See you around,
gym teacher.

01:32:32.912 --> 01:32:35.506
Hey. Let's do that again.

01:32:55.852 --> 01:32:57.354
Hey, Elizabeth.

01:32:57.354 --> 01:32:59.314
Hey, Lynn.
How was your summer?

01:32:59.314 --> 01:33:02.943
It was great.
I went to the zoo almost every weekend.

01:33:02.943 --> 01:33:04.949
Wow, that sounds great.

01:33:05.487 --> 01:33:08.240
You didn't get
your tits.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.543
Yeah, I thought about it and, you know,
realized I don't even need them.

01:33:11.543 --> 01:33:13.871
Plus, they're really
expensive, you know, per tit.

01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:16.047
Yeah, and you got to get two of them.
