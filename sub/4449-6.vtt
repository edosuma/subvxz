JAKES, IF WE'RE NOT--
IF WE'RE NOT FIGHTING FOR HER,

41:18.796 --> 41:21.632
THEN WHO--
WHO ARE WE FIGHTING FOR?

41:21.666 --> 41:23.201
- SHH.

41:23.234 --> 41:24.502
- [crying]

41:24.535 --> 41:27.505
- I DON'T KNOW, LOVE.
I DON'T--

41:27.505 --> 41:29.340
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

41:29.373 --> 41:32.376
- [crying]

41:41.285 --> 41:42.854
- MIKEY MIKE, WHAT'S UP?

41:42.887 --> 41:45.089
- CARTEL-STYLE HIT
ON LAWRENCE,

41:45.123 --> 41:48.426
SO SAYS THE HEAD
OF THE LAPD GANG TASK FORCE.

41:48.459 --> 41:49.627
I MADE A FRIEND.

41:49.660 --> 41:52.396
- WHO'S THIS?
- DETECTIVE SID MARKHAM.

41:52.396 --> 41:54.132
HE'S OUR INSIDER.

41:54.132 --> 41:56.134
- IN THE FLESH
AT OUR CRIME SCENE?

41:56.134 --> 41:57.602
- MM-HMM.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

41:57.635 --> 41:59.170
- I LOOKED INTO EVERYONE
WHO WAS PART

41:59.203 --> 42:00.404
OF OUR PREP TEAM
FOR THE BUS OP,

42:00.438 --> 42:03.241
DEA, US, LAPD.

42:03.274 --> 42:05.176
DETECTIVE ARCHIE GARRETT,

42:05.209 --> 42:07.411
SID'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND
AT GTF.

42:07.445 --> 42:09.647
- AND, UH, THIS GARRETT,
HE WAS THERE AT THE OPS.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.115
- HE WAS RIGHT ACROSS
FROM ME.

42:11.149 --> 42:13.417
THIS IS HOW CARLITO KNEW
WE WERE WAITING FOR HIM.

42:13.451 --> 42:17.221
BRIGGS, I SAW IT
IN HIS EYES.

42:17.255 --> 42:20.691
- THE LAPD GANG TASK FORCE--
MIKE, THEY ROLL WITH A BIG ARMY.

42:20.725 --> 42:23.594
- I KNOW.
[chuckles]

42:23.628 --> 42:27.131
AND WE ARE GONNA BURN THEM
TO THE GROUND.

42:58.496 --> 43:01.098
[dog barking]
