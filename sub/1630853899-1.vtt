01:22.457 --> 01:26.878
Goodbye, Miss Kyoko.

01:27.004 --> 01:31.717
Goodbye, Miss Madoka.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.846
Goodbye, kids. Take care.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.472
See you tomorrow.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.564
How about a drink tonight?

01:45.689 --> 01:49.318
I've got so much reading to do.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.778
You study too hard.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.114
Let your hair down sometimes.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.284
It's settled.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.199
When it rains,

02:37.324 --> 02:42.245
the souls of the dead
pour down to Earth.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.546
Who told you that, Rika?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.516
Sorry, I'm late.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.770
You must be her mother.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.648
Time to go, then.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.234
Off you go.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.031
Goodbye, Miss Kyoko.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.617
See you tomorrow.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.454
Bye-bye!

03:58.739 --> 04:00.574
Here's your fried rice.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.328
Sorry for the wait.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.750
Mei-feng, your phone's ringing!

04:11.042 --> 04:12.461
Mei-feng!

04:13.044 --> 04:15.005
Who is it?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.883
Her boyfriend, who else?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.096
Goddamn it.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.182
What's wrong?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.893
He hates her boyfriend.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.353
Poor girl with a dad like that.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.148
Welcome...

04:34.191 --> 04:35.233
Kyoko...

04:38.028 --> 04:41.656
- Not studying?
- I dragged her out.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.787
You guys hardly see each other.
Are you grateful?

04:46.912 --> 04:48.288
Nosey cow.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.666
- What are you drinking?
- Don't blush.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.252
- Only romantics buy gifts like this.
- Shut up.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.547
- That's lovely.
- Isn't it?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.174
A beautiful necklace,

04:59.299 --> 05:04.221
said to guarantee eternal love
between giver and recipient.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.100
- I said it was a secret.
- Sorry.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.872
Listen. I don't want you
calling my daughter.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.000
- Leave her alone!
- Mr. Wang, don't be like that.

05:35.210 --> 05:39.714
<i>- Dad, where are you?
- Me-feng'?</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:41.716
Mei-feng?

05:43.051 --> 05:46.096
Where are you now?

05:47.138 --> 05:49.057
Why did you call your own cell phone?

05:49.182 --> 05:54.187
<i>I told you it's dangerous
to leave oil on the gas.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.118
Mei-feng! What's wrong?
Mei-feng!

06:08.243 --> 06:09.911
What's the matter?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.415
That was Mei-feng, she...

06:27.137 --> 06:28.555
Mei-feng...

06:29.431 --> 06:31.016
What's wrong?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.768
Seen a ghost?

06:34.853 --> 06:37.939
We'd run out of black beans.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.482
You okay?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.237
- What was that call about?
- What call?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.949
There it is!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.911
Keep your hands off my phone.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.502
ONE MISSED CALL

07:01.087 --> 07:05.216
<i>Child therapy?
So you're quitting day care?</i>

07:05.342 --> 07:06.635
Not at all.

07:06.760 --> 07:11.806
The course will help me
look after the children.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.894
Some of our kids are in a bad way.
Abused and stuff.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.649
- Where's your Dad?
- In back, I guess.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.569
No need to make her wait.
You're done for today.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.030
Thanks.
I'll just be a minute.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.955
- You got a new one?
- New number, too. I'll send it.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.467
ONE MISSED CALL

07:47.592 --> 07:49.386
Great, thanks.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.764
- Send it to me, too.
- Sure.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.017
Mr. Wang...

07:57.268 --> 07:59.771
About tomorrow's prep...

08:01.815 --> 08:03.233
Mr. Wang?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.240
Are you there?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.429
What's this?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.348
I didn't download this ringtone.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.773
Maybe by mistake.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.316
ONE MISSED CALL

09:32.947 --> 09:36.034
Haven't you heard that tune before?

09:38.661 --> 09:44.250
I remember, about a year ago,
that thing with the spooky cell phones.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.755
- When that girl died on TV?
- Right.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.133
How did that all end up?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.380
Hey, what are you doing?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.889
Oh, it's you. What's up?

10:40.014 --> 10:43.351
Was there a red candy in his mouth?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.603
Still working that old case?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.314
- What about the candy?
- Nothing there.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.237
What about his phone?
I want the call log.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.823
- No phone, either.
- None?

10:57.365 --> 11:00.702
He didn't own a cell phone.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.624
I see.

11:07.917 --> 11:12.255
If the brass finds out you're here,
you'll get the axe.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.509
Sorry to bother you.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.526
Was there a candy in his mouth?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.387
No candy.

12:04.015 --> 12:08.228
And he never owned a cell phone.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.772
Are you sure?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.400
One witness heard the killer ringtone.

12:15.235 --> 12:20.490
Why are you...
so obsessed with this case?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.836
It's my job.

12:38.216 --> 12:45.139
I've said it before,
this case defies easy answers.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.728
Is Yumi Nakamura still missing?

12:53.439 --> 12:57.193
There's a reason for everything.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.030
Nothing in this world is inexplicable.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.287
This is beyond rational explanation.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.855
You've not smoked for over a year.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.607
I regret it every day.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.821
Like being trapped in an endless maze.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.326
You and me, both.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.131
Hello? Kyoko?

14:00.965 --> 14:04.510
The police are done with me.
You okay?

14:10.266 --> 14:14.145
- What is it?
- Can I ask you a few questions?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.272
JOURNALIST- TAKAKO NOZOE

14:16.397 --> 14:21.527
- A call forewarning death?
- You hear the sound of your own death.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.281
I remember that story.

14:26.157 --> 14:30.370
People die at random
from the call log, right?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.289
It's not a story.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.709
I guess Mr. Wang took the call
and died instead.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.382
You really believe this?

14:45.385 --> 14:49.931
Last April, a schoolgirl drowned.

14:50.681 --> 14:55.645
Three days later, her friend died.

14:58.856 --> 15:03.319
Then a boy she met through friends.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.613
<i>Then Natsumi Konishi.</i>

15:08.157 --> 15:12.161
You don't remember?
She died on live TV.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.083
I was abroad working.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.335
Doing what?

15:19.460 --> 15:24.090
This job's part-time.
I'm a photographer's assistant.

15:26.342 --> 15:30.847
So... you're saying they were killed
by some kind of ghost?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
Mimiko Mizunuma.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.773
She died two years ago.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.737
Anything strange happen recently?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.869
Not really.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.917
What?

16:00.626 --> 16:03.296
It's probably nothing but...

16:04.672 --> 16:11.053
Mr. Wang took a weird call
meant for his daughter.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.268
Was this the ringtone?

16:26.694 --> 16:28.654
I think it was.

16:32.909 --> 16:36.621
- I also heard it...
- Where?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.082
On my friend Madoka's cell phone.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.961
- Can you call her?
- Sure.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.242
<i>How's Mei-feng?</i>

17:16.118 --> 17:19.080
A sedative finally got her to sleep.

17:28.506 --> 17:32.134
I made some soup
since she'd had nothing all day.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.679
She didn't eat it.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.015
<i>Poor thing.</i>

17:38.140 --> 17:41.185
<i>How about you? Need help?</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:45.273
I'm fine. Naoto will be back soon.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.860
<i>Okay, I won't come round, then.</i>

17:51.821 --> 17:53.197
Hey, Madoka.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.368
Is someone with you?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.329
<i>No, I'm alone.</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:03.958
Something's moving behind you.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.631
<i>Don't try and scare me!</i>

18:18.556 --> 18:20.391
Get out of there now!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.563
<i>- What for?</i>
- <i>Behind</i> you...

18:30.776 --> 18:32.153
<i>What?</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:34.697
<i>What's the matter?</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:37.617
<i>Kyoko?</i>

18:59.889 --> 19:01.098
Madoka...

19:03.184 --> 19:06.020
Kyoko, what's wrong?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.864
ONE NEW MESSAGE

19:18.157 --> 19:21.118
<i>6201 PM, JULY 17TH
- FROM MADOKA</i>

19:26.832 --> 19:29.293
<i>One new message.</i>

19:29.418 --> 19:35.174
<i>First message,
sent 18:01, July 17th.</i>

21:11.437 --> 21:12.772
Madoka?

21:16.442 --> 21:17.651
Madoka?

22:00.361 --> 22:01.779
Madoka?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.285
Madoka, are you home?

22:40.818 --> 22:41.861
Madoka?

22:47.241 --> 22:48.450
Madoka!

23:06.802 --> 23:08.512
Kyoko, are you okay?

23:08.637 --> 23:09.889
Naoto...

23:13.183 --> 23:14.977
In there...

23:46.050 --> 23:49.762
It's that same ringtone.

24:04.526 --> 24:09.114
KYOKO OKUDERA

24:12.159 --> 24:13.827
No way.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.677
SETAGAYA DISTRICT
POLICE STATION

24:40.270 --> 24:42.147
Take a look at this.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.952
When was it sent?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.917
<i>9210 PM, JULY 20TH</i>

25:02.042 --> 25:03.919
That's in three days.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.922
A call from the future.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.299
Like those serial murders.

25:10.134 --> 25:13.053
It's still going on.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.935
Can I keep this phone?

25:29.695 --> 25:32.906
Find out where this was filmed.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.909
We should file a report
and wait for orders...

25:36.035 --> 25:41.915
- There's no time. Just do it.
- How do we keep tabs on a ghost?

25:42.958 --> 25:46.420
- There's nothing the police can do.
- Hey!

25:48.088 --> 25:49.506
Pardon me.

25:50.257 --> 25:55.304
You can help her, right?

25:57.514 --> 25:59.475
We'll do all we can.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.352
That's it?

26:08.776 --> 26:11.153
JULY 18TH

26:11.278 --> 26:14.656
May we ask you about
your granddaughter, Mimiko?

26:14.782 --> 26:16.825
She's no granddaughter to me.

26:20.829 --> 26:25.918
She was born after her mother's rape...

26:27.336 --> 26:30.881
by a lunatic intruder.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.842
Was he caught?

26:34.968 --> 26:37.012
Unlucky bastard.

26:38.180 --> 26:43.602
My husband caught him red-handed.

26:44.186 --> 26:48.315
And he stabbed him to death.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.364
Where's your husband now?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.367
After jail, he went back home.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.955
Although he vowed he'd never...

27:03.080 --> 27:05.791
<i>"I'll</i> never go back there again."

27:05.916 --> 27:07.626
Never go back?

27:09.294 --> 27:12.131
Is he Chinese?

27:13.423 --> 27:14.967
Taiwanese.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.387
You speak Mandarin?

27:19.263 --> 27:20.722
A little.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.308
What's his name?

27:24.643 --> 27:25.978
Wei Zhang.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.356
How can I contact him?

27:33.694 --> 27:37.823
I doubt he'll talk to you.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.077
Jail messed with his head.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.371
In what way?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.917
He says he can see her.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.338
Some girl who's out to kill him.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.598
Excuse me...

28:04.892 --> 28:07.936
What was Mimiko like?

28:09.688 --> 28:12.107
A creepy little thing.

28:15.861 --> 28:20.199
Even her mother regretted having her.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.622
But she'd done nothing wrong.

28:31.793 --> 28:37.257
<i>The number you have dialed
is temporarily out of service.</i>

28:48.769 --> 28:49.937
<i>Stop!</i>

29:22.427 --> 29:24.721
INCOMING CALL

29:44.491 --> 29:45.784
Hello?

29:46.243 --> 29:47.786
<i>Yuting?</i>

29:48.704 --> 29:50.163
Takako“.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.499
<i>How have you been?</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:56.420
Good to hear from you. All well?

29:59.381 --> 30:00.590
Yeah.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.553
I need your help.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.848
I'm looking for a guy in Taiwan,
Wei Zhang.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.351
I have an old address in Taipei.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.980
Okay, I'll get on it.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.902
- What's the article?
- Cell phone calls that predict death.

30:21.028 --> 30:27.075
Eh? You get a call
from your own cell phone,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.202
and then you end up dead?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.996
<i>How do you know about it?</i>

30:33.915 --> 30:35.959
Is it happening there in Taiwan, too?

30:39.755 --> 30:43.550
Here's the forensic report
on that girl, Madoka.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.886
- Was there any candy?
- No...

30:46.011 --> 30:49.556
But traces of coal dust were found
in the stomach lining.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.141
- Coal?
- Yes.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.355
Mimiko's victims always had
a red candy.

30:56.480 --> 31:03.028
They found the same coal dust
in the stomach of the restaurant owner.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.573
Analysis says it's not from Japan.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.078
Check to see if it's from Taiwan.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.832
Why Taiwan?

31:15.957 --> 31:18.794
They've had the same murders there, too.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.004
What?

31:21.129 --> 31:27.344
Long before Mimiko died.

31:33.767 --> 31:37.270
JULY 19TH

32:07.926 --> 32:11.430
<i>Excuse me,
I'm looking for Mr. Wei Zhang.</i>

32:13.181 --> 32:14.683
No idea.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.059
Thank you.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.226
WEI ZHANG

33:03.565 --> 33:04.983
Mr. Zhang?

33:07.611 --> 33:09.029
Mr. Zhang?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.486
Is anyone home?

37:06.933 --> 37:08.685
It's been two years.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.188
You still wear the ring?

37:14.983 --> 37:19.154
We're separated, not divorced, right?

37:24.659 --> 37:27.871
Did you find your guy?

37:29.706 --> 37:33.293
Yes, but I didn't get to talk to him.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.380
I was the first to find his body.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.634
I just got done with the cops.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.428
Are you okay?

37:47.015 --> 37:48.808
How about you?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.269
You look tired.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.899
I've been quite busy.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.656
What have you been working on?

38:04.491 --> 38:07.327
KILLER CELL PHONE:
LINKS & OBSERVATIONS

38:09.078 --> 38:13.374
Is this... a list of the victims?

38:18.421 --> 38:20.215
Did you compile it?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.218
Yuting?

38:23.927 --> 38:27.388
Don't get involved.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.767
What do you mean?

38:41.861 --> 38:42.904
Hello?

38:43.029 --> 38:44.906
It's Naoto.

38:46.032 --> 38:49.118
Did you meet Mimiko's grandfather?

38:49.244 --> 38:51.329
<i>He's already dead...</i>

38:52.956 --> 38:54.999
<i>...after getting the call.</i>

38:57.335 --> 39:01.130
Maybe Mimiko was the next victim,

39:02.173 --> 39:04.968
from his cell phone's memory.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.681
- Mimiko's autopsy report.
- What about it?

39:09.806 --> 39:14.853
As you said, there was coal dust
in the stomach.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.232
I see.

39:20.859 --> 39:26.030
Mr. Wang and Madoka had coal dust
not candy inside them.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.408
So...

39:30.326 --> 39:31.995
...Kyoko's caller...

39:33.079 --> 39:35.164
<i>...might not be Mimiko.</i>

39:36.249 --> 39:40.587
<i>Police analysis places
the coal mine in the hometown</i>

39:40.712 --> 39:43.172
<i>of Mimiko's grandfather.</i>

40:04.986 --> 40:06.988
What's wrong?

40:51.199 --> 40:53.076
INCOMING CALL - KYOKO OKUDERA

40:56.788 --> 40:58.206
How come?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.353
Please stop!

41:33.116 --> 41:34.951
Still hearing it?

41:36.911 --> 41:38.371
It's nothing.

41:40.915 --> 41:46.004
You can't let this go
because of your sister, right?

41:49.674 --> 41:53.344
<i>Rock, paper, scissors.
Try it again.</i>

41:57.390 --> 42:00.685
Rock, paper, scissors.
Try it again.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.729
Try it again.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.833
- Pick it up.
- I don't want to.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.046
- Go on.
- Stop it!

42:30.882 --> 42:32.508
It'll be fine.

42:52.945 --> 42:56.491
<i>My sister never came home.</i>

42:57.909 --> 42:59.327
<i>Then...</i>

43:02.330 --> 43:03.956
That night...

43:05.583 --> 43:08.127
...I heard her voice.

43:08.878 --> 43:12.131
"Stop, that hurts," she said.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.094
Immediately after that...

43:17.637 --> 43:20.765
...I was hit by a wave
of agonizing pain.

43:23.184 --> 43:25.269
The moment she died.

43:29.107 --> 43:32.693
She didn't just drown,
she was murdered...

43:34.362 --> 43:36.864
...by whoever was on that phone.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.036
Takako“.

43:43.412 --> 43:46.332
Stop blaming yourself.

43:53.172 --> 43:58.261
Even if it's true,
it has nothing to do with this.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.181
Forget the coal mine, go back to Japan.

44:05.560 --> 44:11.482
Kyoko Okudera might die tomorrow.

44:15.528 --> 44:22.743
That's too bad, but once you get the call,
there's no escaping your fate.

44:23.327 --> 44:27.248
It's unlike you to say that.

44:28.749 --> 44:31.294
I didn't make that list.

44:33.838 --> 44:37.550
A journalist friend of mine did.

44:38.801 --> 44:41.971
- Let me meet him.
- He died three days ago.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.975
After getting the call.

44:48.186 --> 44:50.188
DELETE ENTRY

45:17.673 --> 45:21.052
What's up? It's me.

45:21.177 --> 45:24.680
Who else could it be?

45:26.182 --> 45:27.350
You must be kidding.

45:28.351 --> 45:30.269
Some guys are like that.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.356
No idea where they stand.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.066
She's so useless.

45:35.191 --> 45:37.568
Too dumb to get it.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.029
Hey, where are you?

45:40.821 --> 45:42.740
Some other kids will be there.

45:43.199 --> 45:45.284
He's such a jerk.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.703
What's the point of it all?

45:57.004 --> 46:02.885
You're joking! Shut up
or they'll sew your mouth up, too!

46:03.761 --> 46:09.267
Never?
It's a really famous urban legend.

46:10.226 --> 46:16.315
A girl appears at your bedside
at 2:22 AM.

46:17.233 --> 46:20.903
At first glance, she's got no mouth.

46:21.946 --> 46:26.742
Then you look close and there is one.

46:27.285 --> 46:31.747
But it's hard to see
because it's all sewn up.

46:32.373 --> 46:38.629
Then she mumbles, "Play with me."

46:41.424 --> 46:48.139
If you refuse or don't answer,
she stitches up your mouth...

46:48.264 --> 46:50.474
What should I answer?

46:51.309 --> 46:54.270
- What?
- What do I say to her?

46:54.395 --> 46:57.565
It's just a stupid story.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.191
A story...

47:02.778 --> 47:04.363
Pardon me.

47:10.369 --> 47:13.289
I don't know what to do.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.674
Do you remember this place?

47:26.802 --> 47:29.805
I found your cell phone over there.

47:32.558 --> 47:39.940
I picked it up, then you called
to tell me to give it back.

47:45.571 --> 47:48.532
If I hadn't picked it up...

47:50.659 --> 47:53.037
maybe this wouldn't be happening.

47:57.333 --> 48:00.044
It's not your fault, Naoto.

48:03.005 --> 48:08.677
If you hadn't picked it up,
we'd never have met.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.473
Kyoko...

48:27.029 --> 48:32.660
Naoto... I'm going to Taiwan.

48:34.662 --> 48:35.704
Kyoko...

48:36.872 --> 48:40.835
There's nothing I can do here.

48:41.710 --> 48:47.425
If I find that coal mine,
maybe I'll find a way to save myself.

48:54.807 --> 48:56.225
Let me go.

48:58.727 --> 49:01.063
I'll go for you.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.817
I don't want you to be in danger.

49:09.280 --> 49:13.200
Same for me.

49:24.837 --> 49:28.257
Okay. Let's go together.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.052
I'll make sure you're okay.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.847
You have my word.

49:58.704 --> 50:02.708
JULY 20TH

50:08.380 --> 50:10.299
I rented a car.

50:10.883 --> 50:12.343
Thank you.

50:15.763 --> 50:18.057
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.894
There's still some time left.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.146
You're tough.

50:26.106 --> 50:28.108
Thanks to Naoto.

50:30.194 --> 50:34.448
Before we go to the mine,
let me show you something.

50:34.573 --> 50:35.991
Where?

50:38.160 --> 50:42.581
Until about 100 years ago,
there was a wealthy mining village.

50:43.749 --> 50:50.589
But the villagers mysteriously died off,
and now it's a ghost town.

50:51.173 --> 50:56.136
The only survivor lives near here.

51:20.828 --> 51:24.039
Are you Shu-mei Gao?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.002
I'm Nozoe, from Japan.

51:29.295 --> 51:31.672
Do you speak Japanese, Mrs. Gao?

51:34.216 --> 51:35.634
Mrs. Gao?

51:40.931 --> 51:42.266
Mrs. Gao?

51:58.824 --> 52:01.201
I have something to ask you.

52:03.287 --> 52:04.747
Mrs. Gao...

52:06.624 --> 52:10.586
You're from the mining village, right?

52:13.922 --> 52:17.635
Tell me what happened there.

52:18.844 --> 52:22.806
Why did all the people die?

52:25.934 --> 52:27.353
Mrs. Gao!

52:27.936 --> 52:29.313
Mrs. Gao!

52:29.897 --> 52:32.358
You're the only one who knows.

52:33.192 --> 52:35.736
Mrs. Gao. Mrs. Gao!

52:35.861 --> 52:38.864
She's nuts!

52:39.323 --> 52:44.787
She did that to her own eyes
when she was a kid.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.717
Dear Lord, protect me!

52:58.842 --> 53:02.388
Li Li's coming to kill me!

53:03.222 --> 53:09.687
Li Li's coming.

53:09.812 --> 53:13.649
She's coming to kill me.

53:14.149 --> 53:16.151
Who's Li Li?

53:20.864 --> 53:23.283
Pull yourself together.

53:24.326 --> 53:27.371
Please calm down.

53:36.380 --> 53:40.467
Li Li's a monster.

53:41.802 --> 53:45.431
Killed everyone with her curse.

53:47.224 --> 53:54.148
I was only six years old then.

53:58.026 --> 54:02.197
<i>She was a creepy girl.</i>

54:02.322 --> 54:05.367
<i>Always mumbling to herself.</i>

54:05.826 --> 54:10.205
<i>Like she was talking
to an invisible person.</i>

54:25.304 --> 54:28.932
<i>You'll die in three days.</i>

54:33.854 --> 54:36.732
Just as she said,

54:36.857 --> 54:41.737
the boy died vomiting blood.

54:42.404 --> 54:44.740
Not only him.

54:45.282 --> 54:54.833
Everyone she told, all the villagers
died agonizing deaths.

54:55.751 --> 55:02.966
My brother, my friends,
my neighbors, everyone.

55:03.967 --> 55:07.971
All killed by her curse.

55:09.097 --> 55:13.393
The relatives became enraged.

55:13.519 --> 55:18.649
They dragged her to the coal mine.

55:18.774 --> 55:20.442
Once there...

55:25.739 --> 55:35.791
<i>...they sewed her mouth shut
so she'd never foretell another death.</i>

55:46.468 --> 55:53.892
Then they shut her in
and sealed the pit forever.

56:03.402 --> 56:09.324
We'll go on alone.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.159
Huh?

56:11.869 --> 56:15.122
You didn't get the call,
you shouldn't be involved.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.293
I'm not here just for you.

56:22.254 --> 56:27.259
The cop told us about your sister.

56:29.595 --> 56:32.598
It was an accident, right?

56:33.640 --> 56:37.227
If there's no connection to this,
why bother?

56:40.314 --> 56:42.774
Because I wished her dead.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.109
Huh?

56:45.402 --> 56:46.820
Why?

56:49.907 --> 56:55.662
Although we were twins,
she alone was safe from dad's hands.

57:02.628 --> 57:04.838
I hated her for that.

57:16.975 --> 57:19.186
Please don't blame yourself.

57:27.361 --> 57:29.696
I feel like she's calling me.

57:38.372 --> 57:39.915
Hello?

57:40.040 --> 57:42.793
<i>Where are you?</i>

57:43.835 --> 57:46.171
<i>You didn't go back to Japan?</i>

57:47.464 --> 57:49.341
I'm going into the mine.

57:49.883 --> 57:53.053
I told you not to get involved!

57:53.178 --> 57:54.763
<i>What's wrong?</i>

57:56.723 --> 57:59.017
It's incredibly dangerous.

58:01.520 --> 58:06.274
Don't tell me... you got the call?

58:09.903 --> 58:11.363
<i>Am I right?</i>

58:12.572 --> 58:14.741
Why didn't you tell me?

58:19.621 --> 58:21.039
Because“.

58:22.916 --> 58:25.210
...I didn't want you involved.

58:35.721 --> 58:39.766
When is your time?

58:42.602 --> 58:44.438
Shouldn't you go back?

58:44.563 --> 58:47.858
His time is an hour earlier than mine.

58:47.983 --> 58:51.778
There's nothing I can do.

59:03.081 --> 59:05.083
I guess we walk from here.

59:48.126 --> 59:50.128
Let's find the entrance.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.422
Yes.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:06.186
Why was Li Li born with such power?

1:00:07.062 --> 1:00:11.399
Maybe she didn't have it at birth.

1:00:14.653 --> 1:00:19.032
There was a water-borne plague
in these parts.

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:24.830
The symptoms would be
just like she described.

1:00:25.539 --> 1:00:27.958
What's that to Li Li?

1:00:29.292 --> 1:00:34.840
Maybe her gift was to know

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:38.343
when someone had the disease,

1:00:40.011 --> 1:00:43.098
until they cruelly killed her.

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:09.416
It's completely blocked.

1:01:10.208 --> 1:01:12.627
There must be another entrance.

1:01:12.752 --> 1:01:15.714
Let's split up.

1:01:15.839 --> 1:01:17.757
Don't go by yourself.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:22.721
There's no time, let's go.

1:01:28.393 --> 1:01:30.061
<i>Stop it</i>

1:02:00.133 --> 1:02:01.384
Hello?

1:02:01.885 --> 1:02:03.553
<i>It's Motomiya.</i>

1:02:05.263 --> 1:02:07.224
Hello, Detective.

1:02:07.891 --> 1:02:11.311
You scared me.
It was that ringtone.

1:02:11.436 --> 1:02:13.521
<i>Yumi Nakamura's dead.</i>
