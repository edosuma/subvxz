Hello and welcome to the Pageant of the Five Food Groups.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.800
I'm a banana. I'm in the fruit group.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.990
To maintain a healthy and balanced diet,

00:14.010 --> 00:19.370
you should have two, three,
or four servings of me per day.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.850
I'm a chicken drumstick.

00:22.870 --> 00:25.450
I'm from the Meat and Poultry group.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.670
To maintain a healthy and balanced diet,

00:28.690 --> 00:33.400
you should have two or three
servings of me each and every day.

00:38.940 --> 00:42.430
I'm a pea pod. I'm...

00:42.440 --> 00:44.970
You're a vegetable.

00:47.350 --> 00:50.370
You're a vegetable!

00:52.350 --> 00:55.890
I'm a veg... I'm in the...

00:56.700 --> 00:58.560
Vegetable...

01:04.800 --> 01:08.280
Three to five servings per day.

01:08.290 --> 01:10.300
What?

01:10.330 --> 01:14.680
Three to five servings per day.

Mommy, Mommy, wake up.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.040
Oh, Marie, honey, you okay?

01:33.520 --> 01:36.470
Did you have another
bad dream about the play?

01:36.480 --> 01:38.630
Can I sleep with you?

01:38.640 --> 01:41.190
Of course you can, sweetie.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.220
Just as long as you
say your lines right.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.660
Come on, honey. Let's hear them.

01:49.670 --> 01:53.050
Marie, honey? We need
you to say those lines.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.890
Come on, honey. We're serious.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.670
If you don't say those lines right,

01:56.700 --> 02:00.540
you're just going to have to stand by the
side of the bed for the rest of your life.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.520
I'm a pea pod. I'm a part
of the vegetable group.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.210
When I was in kindergarten,
I was the tomato.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.340
And Scottie Collins, he was the peanut.

03:07.740 --> 03:11.310
And he got so scared, he
peed right there on the stage.

03:11.340 --> 03:15.300
And from that day on, we called
him "pee-nut." And we still do.

03:15.310 --> 03:17.580
Okay, Bridgette, that is enough.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.650
- Mom?
- You okay?

03:22.820 --> 03:25.230
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.370
- Let me give you a hand.
- No, no, I'm okay. Just let me sit.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.920
Let me just sit down for a second.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.180
Whoo, I was feeling a little bit faint.

03:35.190 --> 03:37.530
For a second there.

03:37.910 --> 03:42.300
Honey, honey, I'm okay. Just
probably drank too much coffee.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.450
Are you sure? You want
me to call the doctor?

03:45.460 --> 03:48.040
- No.
- Maybe we should run you by the emergency room.

03:48.050 --> 03:49.790
No, I'm okay.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.170
Okay, well, let me take
the girls to school.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.530
That way you only have to worry
about getting yourself to work.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.940
A-ha, my master plan worked.

04:01.130 --> 04:04.250
I'll be fine, honey, but
that would be really nice.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.860
Allison, I see you found me.

04:17.570 --> 04:20.209
Went to the office. They told me you
wanted me out here. What's going on?

04:20.220 --> 04:23.060
City Controller called me a
little after 8:00 this morning.

04:23.090 --> 04:27.150
Department of Public Works is laying
some new underground power lines out here

04:27.160 --> 04:29.980
and one of their crews came
across... Watch your step.

04:29.990 --> 04:33.250
One of their crews came across
a body in a shallow grave.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.900
Looks like the fellow was
shot sometime last night.

04:35.910 --> 04:36.880
What are you doing out here?

04:36.900 --> 04:42.000
I mean, until somebody's charged with the
murder, isn't this really a police matter?

04:42.020 --> 04:46.210
Well, since the dead man met with foul play,
the whole area is now an active crime scene,

04:46.230 --> 04:50.950
and that means that work has to stop until
investigation of the death is completed.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.700
And that means that the city's
paying for all these contractors,

04:53.720 --> 04:55.640
workers to stand around doing nothing.

04:55.650 --> 04:59.200
So, I was asked to help expedite things.

04:59.910 --> 05:02.270
Naturally, he has no ID.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.870
I'm guessing that whoever
killed him saw to that.

05:04.890 --> 05:08.470
We're running his prints and his
DNA, but that's gonna take a while.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.100
Also, we found some hairs on
his body that don't belong to him

05:12.130 --> 05:14.050
and that might point
to whoever did this,

05:14.070 --> 05:20.710
but I was hoping that you would just take a
look at him and have one of your eureka moments.

05:25.430 --> 05:28.210
Sorry. No eureka. No nothing.

05:28.590 --> 05:32.240
Well, maybe this will help.
Ankle holster, but no gun.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.920
- Was he on the force? -
Nope. Not police-issued.

05:39.770 --> 05:44.730
All right, well, you'll let me know if
any bells go off in your head, won't you?

05:44.740 --> 05:47.950
Of course, you'll be
the first person I call.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.370
Allison! Hey, can you hear me?

05:52.110 --> 05:54.110
Someone call an ambulance. Get a doctor!

05:54.120 --> 05:57.660
Allison! Allison! Allison!

05:57.930 --> 06:01.920
Allison! Allison! Allison!

06:44.700 --> 06:46.040
Where is she?

06:46.050 --> 06:47.900
They took her in the back.

06:48.290 --> 06:49.860
Excuse me. Can I help you?

06:50.170 --> 06:53.750
My name is Dubois.
D-U-B-O-I-S.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.180
My wife, Allison, was just brought
in here. I just wanted to see her.

06:57.190 --> 06:59.530
Uh, maybe I could talk
to somebody about her.

06:59.550 --> 07:02.050
The doctors are with your
wife right now, Mr. Dubois.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.400
Somebody will come out and talk
to you just as soon as they can.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.120
Yeah, I just want to
know what was going on.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.980
You have to wait for the doctor
to come out and talk to you.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.930
I'm sorry. That's all I can tell you.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.650
- Okay, thank you.
- Come sit down, Joe.

07:25.110 --> 07:29.190
Quiet. It's all right.
I live around here.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.830
Mr. Dubois?

07:35.850 --> 07:37.540
Yeah, hi.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.140
Mr. Dubois, I'm Dr. Richards.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.690
Hello. My... my wife? Can I see her?

07:41.700 --> 07:44.590
I don't know what you know. I
don't know what you've heard.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.350
Your wife arrived unconscious.

07:47.380 --> 07:51.650
Unfortunately, she's still unconscious,
and frankly, we don't know why.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.350
What do you mean you don't know why?

07:53.370 --> 07:55.600
Well, there's no evidence
of physical trauma.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.330
A bruise to the head or
any other kind of injury.

07:58.350 --> 08:02.460
The CAT scan is negative, uh, no
evidence of scarring on the brain.

08:02.480 --> 08:06.710
So, for the moment
we're a bit at a loss.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.780
She's just not present.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.250
I'm sorry. You have to give me
a better explanation than that.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.120
I don't have a better
explanation than that.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.150
We've called several neurospecialists.

08:17.180 --> 08:21.020
Your wife will be examined by one of them
just as soon as we can get someone here.

08:21.220 --> 08:25.510
Beyond that, I could tell you that when
something like this has happened in the past,

08:25.550 --> 08:30.000
40 to 50% of the time, the patient
just comes out of it spontaneously.

08:30.730 --> 08:33.950
Okay, what about the other,
uh, 50 or 60% of the time?

08:35.450 --> 08:37.919
You just sit tight. Leave
your numbers at the desk.

08:37.929 --> 08:41.580
And as soon as your wife can have
visitors, I'll make sure we find you.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.010
Okay, well, thank
you, thank you, Doctor.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.330
You all right?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.310
Yeah, I gotta go pick
the girls up from school.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.260
I can send a city car
for them if you'd like.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.730
No, it's okay. Thank you, though.

08:56.740 --> 09:00.580
Um, somebody's gotta, you know,
explain to them what's going on.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.740
Um, excuse me. I have
to give them my numbers.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.860
I don't understand.
She got sick at work?

09:09.350 --> 09:12.920
I think that maybe she was starting to get sick
this morning when she fell down in the kitchen.

09:12.940 --> 09:17.150
But, you know, in any event, she's in
the hospital right now and you know,

09:17.170 --> 09:19.240
they're taking really great care of her.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.940
Can we visit her?

09:20.970 --> 09:24.760
Not today, sweetie. Not
right now, but soon maybe.

09:24.770 --> 09:26.720
Well, can we talk to her on the phone?

09:26.740 --> 09:29.900
Like I said, not today. Maybe tomorrow.

09:30.170 --> 09:34.410
What's she sick with? I mean, you've gotta
be awfully sick to go to the hospital.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.690
Not necessarily.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.170
Well... who's that, Daddy?

09:42.560 --> 09:44.850
Great. This is all I need.

09:52.910 --> 09:56.420
All right, you kids wait here.
Ariel, lock the door after I get out.

09:58.460 --> 10:02.880
Hey, no, no, no. You can't stand
here, man. This is private property.

10:02.890 --> 10:05.780
Come on. Are you lost?

10:06.470 --> 10:08.980
You need me to call someone for you?

10:10.320 --> 10:13.080
Don't be frightened... Joe.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.750
Excuse me? What did you call me?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.510
Hey, listen to me. I got
kids in that car. My kids.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.460
This is my house; you're preventing
me from getting my kids in my house.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.890
What are you doing?
Don't wave to my children.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.530
Come on, I'm gonna count to three.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.020
And if you're not off this lawn by the
time I'm done, I'm calling the police, okay?

10:30.040 --> 10:33.830
- Not necessary.
- One... two...

10:34.540 --> 10:37.810
- Going, Joe.
- Come on. Come on.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.410
Thank you. Three.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.570
I don't know what to tell you, Mom.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.770
By the time you get out here and get on
a plane, you know, she might just be fine.

10:53.730 --> 10:56.760
I think I just want to wait
and hear from the doctors.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.250
Daddy, he's back!

10:59.280 --> 11:01.260
Mom, let me call you back.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.110
What's going on?

11:07.130 --> 11:09.470
What are you doing here in the
dark staring out the window?

11:09.490 --> 11:11.110
The weird guy in the nightgown?

11:11.140 --> 11:15.430
He's standing on the
sidewalk, staring at our house.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.830
I'm sorry. That's just creepy.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.740
Go to your room and do your homework.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.080
- Well, what are you going to do?
- Go on.

11:31.090 --> 11:34.280
- Call the police?
- I don't know. Go on. Maybe.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.910
Oh, God.

11:38.930 --> 11:42.150
Oh, Joe, I'm so... I'm so
glad you finally came back out.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.200
Right, that's... that's
really nice of you.

11:44.210 --> 11:45.730
Listen, man, you got to...

11:45.740 --> 11:49.210
I don't know who you are or how
you know my name, but, uh, look,

11:49.230 --> 11:50.570
we're going through some
stuff in our house, okay,

11:50.580 --> 11:52.650
- some difficult, painful stuff.
- I kn... I know all about it.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.600
And frankly, you're
upsetting my children.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.970
Oh, please, please, you've got to tell
them everything's going to be okay.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.450
Okay, you're upsetting me, too, okay?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.370
So, um, this is the last time.

12:02.390 --> 12:03.800
Is there somebody that
I can call for you?

12:03.830 --> 12:05.410
Do you have somebody
who can pick you up?

12:05.450 --> 12:09.600
Because, look, if you don't, I-I'm,
I'm going to have to call the police.

12:12.050 --> 12:14.710
No? All right, well, I
got to call the police.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.660
555-0126.

12:19.220 --> 12:21.070
Ask for my husband. He'll... he'll come.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.060
He'll, he'll, he'll pick me
up. He'll figure this out.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.470
That's my number.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.930
That's because I'm your wife.

12:31.450 --> 12:35.380
Dad? It's the hospital. It's about Mom.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.370
You stay here.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.980
Where else would I go?
This is where I live.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.600
I'm not so sure about that.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.240
- Hi, this is Joe Dubois.
- Can you please hold?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.030
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.870
Dad, why are you talking to that
strange man out there? He scares me.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.930
- Wait, wait, wait a second.
- I'm connecting you now.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.900
- Doctor?
- Mr. Dubois?

12:55.910 --> 12:57.750
This is Joe Dubois. H-How is she?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.900
I don't really have
anything new to report.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.890
Still waiting to hear what
our tests today tell us.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.640
Okay. But she's comfortable, right?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.430
Very comfortable.

13:09.460 --> 13:12.610
- And sh-she's there,
right? - Excuse me?

13:12.620 --> 13:15.890
I mean, physically,
you know she's there.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.510
I'm looking right at
her; I'm in her room.

13:18.550 --> 13:19.960
Okay, good, good.

13:19.990 --> 13:25.120
So if you'd still like to see her, today makes
no sense, but I'm sure you could come by tomorrow.

13:25.130 --> 13:29.270
Okay, excellent. Well, th-that's
what I'll do, then. Thank you, Doctor.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.790
So?

13:33.800 --> 13:37.020
So yeah, uh... it's like I said.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.050
She's comfortable. Everything's good.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.630
Um, maybe she'll even
come home tomorrow.

13:43.930 --> 13:46.540
- Did you speak to her?
- How do you mean?

13:46.550 --> 13:49.150
Did you speak to her? Did
she want to speak to us?

13:49.160 --> 13:52.180
No, I guess they gave her
something. She was asleep.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.380
Well, do you want me to go get Bridgette
and Marie so that you can tell them?

13:56.390 --> 13:59.490
'Cause I know that they're really concerned
and that would make them feel better.

13:59.510 --> 14:03.510
Yeah, okay. Uh, let me just
talk to this guy out front first.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.510
Okay, what did you mean by that?

14:15.540 --> 14:16.920
What did I mean by what?

14:17.270 --> 14:19.250
That thing you said before--
that you're my, uh...

14:19.290 --> 14:20.400
- Your wife.
- Yeah.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.390
That's because I am.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.390
I'm Allison, Joe.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.790
How dare you?

14:34.060 --> 14:36.760
You are not my wife. How c...

14:36.780 --> 14:39.790
My wife is in a... in
a coma in the hospital.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.740
She's fighting for her life.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.830
Well, no, not really.

14:44.510 --> 14:48.180
I mean, my body is there, yes,
but y-you got to believe me.

14:49.490 --> 14:53.770
- Joe, this is... this is me.
- Come here. Let me see this.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.350
Okay, you are Todd Emory.

14:58.360 --> 15:04.300
All right, here, Todd Emory, and you
are obviously, clearly, deeply disturbed.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.970
I am disturbed...

15:07.980 --> 15:09.920
but not how you think.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.280
I am disturbed because every time
I pass a mirror or a store window,

15:13.290 --> 15:17.580
- I see a reflection, but it isn't me.
- Oh, my God.

15:17.590 --> 15:22.980
I am disturbed because I have walked
for miles and miles to get here

15:23.010 --> 15:26.510
and you threw me off my own front lawn
this morning in front of my children,

15:26.540 --> 15:31.430
and I am disturbed because the person
I am counting on to get me through this

15:31.440 --> 15:34.180
is acting like he is disgusted by me.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.860
I don't know who this Todd Emory is.

15:35.890 --> 15:39.960
I don't know why he's on my wrist,
but I do know that's my home;

15:40.770 --> 15:43.480
you're my husband;
those are my children.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.740
I'm calling the police.

15:44.760 --> 15:50.160
Good, call the police. Better yet,
call Scanlon. Better yet, call Devalos.

15:54.510 --> 15:56.610
Get the...

16:06.500 --> 16:09.150
No, no, no, come on.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.190
Stop, stop, stop, please. I...

16:14.540 --> 16:17.160
Come on, man. Hey, hey,
hey, sir, sir, please.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.690
Sir, come on, Todd, Todd.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.930
Please. I-I...

16:28.030 --> 16:30.510
Al.

16:40.570 --> 16:43.110
Oh, my God, they're coming up to walk together.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.160
I'm locking the door.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.350
- No, Marie.
- No!

16:53.900 --> 16:58.920
Girls, uh, this is Mr....uh...

16:58.930 --> 17:03.680
Emory. Todd Emory. I'm...

17:04.619 --> 17:07.190
it's very nice to meet the three of you.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.569
I hope I not interrupting your homework.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.650
He's, uh.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.980
he's sleeping here tonight.

17:19.010 --> 17:22.780
In our house? In this house?

17:22.790 --> 17:27.119
Well, he...he needs a place to stay,

17:27.130 --> 17:32.440
I don't want to go into all
the reasons why, but, uh...

17:33.920 --> 17:38.570
I think it's the right
thing to do for tonight.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.450
I can use the couch.

17:44.190 --> 17:48.190
If there is one i-in, in
a room in that direction.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.770
Are you serious?

17:52.780 --> 17:55.310
That's crazy. This is
crazy. You're crazy.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.860
You threw this man off
our lawn this afternoon.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.530
Hey, hey, don't talk to
your father like that.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.710
Don't talk to me like that.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.320
Hold on, hold on a second, young lady.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.970
You know, if Mom was here,
she would never allow this.

18:07.990 --> 18:12.280
Yes, well, Mom is not here. I
am, and you need to trust me.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.920
- Now, hopefully tomorrow, Mister...
- Emory.

18:14.930 --> 18:20.300
Yes, Mr. Emory will go back where
he belongs and Mom will be back here

18:20.340 --> 18:25.080
where she belongs and all
will be right with the world.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.470
- Tomorrow.
- Right, if we live till then.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.260
Well, I'm locking my door,
and I am locking their door,

18:34.270 --> 18:38.500
and if you so much as walk
down this hall past our rooms...

18:38.520 --> 18:39.740
He is not walking anywhere.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.580
He is staying in the
living room on the couch.

18:41.610 --> 18:43.910
He'd better.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.950
That's your eldest daughter.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.200
I think.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.860
She makes me very proud.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.750
What are you doing here?
How did you get in here?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.220
That door was locked.

19:56.610 --> 19:57.910
I used the key.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.710
I know where the key is. I
know where everything is.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.960
Are you forgetting? I
live in this house, too.

20:02.970 --> 20:04.880
What're you doing? What do you want?

20:04.890 --> 20:08.820
Joe, I think I'm a murderer.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.170
Okay, there we go.

20:13.930 --> 20:16.130
Okay.

20:18.150 --> 20:22.030
Okay, hold on. Hold
on. Okay. How's that?

20:22.850 --> 20:25.290
A lot better.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.530
Thanks, hon.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.830
So start over.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.220
Who is it that you think you killed?

20:34.280 --> 20:37.500
Well, I don't really think
I killed anybody, but...

20:37.800 --> 20:42.770
in my dream, Todd Emory-- the
guy who owns this body I'm in--

20:43.140 --> 20:48.930
was burying a man, a dead man, the same dead body
I was looking at with Devalos when I collapsed.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.120
Well, you know what we need to do.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.260
We need to find out who
the hell this Todd Emory is.

20:54.850 --> 20:59.230
According to this, you were
in the same hospital as my wife.

20:59.240 --> 21:04.180
They thought he was in a coma, but then he
disappeared, and they can't figure out how.

20:58.830 --> 21:03.800
{a6}<i>******</i>

21:04.720 --> 21:08.020
"Last seen shortly after 11:00
A. M. lying comatose in his bed."

21:08.030 --> 21:11.530
11:00 A.M.-- isn't that around the time
that you, um, that you went into your coma?

21:11.550 --> 21:13.700
- Yes.
- Okay.

21:13.710 --> 21:16.700
All right, our friend Todd got
hit by a car two nights ago.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.900
I guess he ran out in the middle
of a dark road in the woods,

21:19.910 --> 21:22.380
and that's what put him into his coma.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.660
"At this point,Emory has been
officially declared" a missing person.

21:25.700 --> 21:29.430
"Anyone who has information as to his
whereabouts is urged to contact" the authorities.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.510
His family is said...

21:31.550 --> 21:33.330
to be offering a sizable reward."

21:33.360 --> 21:36.450
Wow, Joe, the whole city's
looking for this guy.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.610
Whole city is looking for me.
I mean, I can't leave the house.

21:38.620 --> 21:43.330
I can't go anywhere or do anything
to help myself get out of this.

21:54.110 --> 21:55.640
What are you doing?

21:55.660 --> 22:01.500
Devalos told me that they found
some hairs on that dead man's body

22:01.510 --> 22:05.250
that weren't his, so
you give this to him.

22:05.260 --> 22:08.850
You just ask him if they
match the hair they found.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.890
No explanations, no back stories.

22:11.940 --> 22:16.850
Just ask him to test, and if
he gets a match, then you can...

22:16.860 --> 22:19.160
You tell him I'm here.
And all the rest of it.

22:20.050 --> 22:23.540
Listen, if not, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.670
Okay, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.420
What do you mean?

22:26.450 --> 22:31.700
Well, because if I give this to Devalos, 
and this matched then who will implicating you

22:31.730 --> 22:33.960
you know, this new you, in a murder.

22:33.970 --> 22:36.690
Oh, well, we have to do something.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.780
What if I woke up as Todd
Emory? Because I'm supposed to...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.980
bring him to justice for
murdering that John Doe.

22:43.990 --> 22:47.360
No. But the way it stands right now, you
wouldn't be bringing Todd Emory to justice.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.640
- You'd be bringing yourself.
- No, I don't think so.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.250
Yes. No, I-I-I
think that

22:51.260 --> 22:55.140
if the police can prove that Todd
Emory murdered that man in the park,

22:56.400 --> 22:59.120
everything's going to go
back to normal. I-I just...

22:59.130 --> 23:01.650
I just have to believe that.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.110
I mean, when the kids wake
up, take them out to breakfast.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.920
I-I don't want them to have to look
at me across the breakfast table.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.240
I frighten them.

23:12.260 --> 23:15.170
You sure sound like Allison.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.100
Going out for pancakes on a school day?

23:18.130 --> 23:20.750
Just when you think there's
no such thing as miracles.

23:21.510 --> 23:26.200
I don't understand it. We're just
letting that stranger stay in our house?

23:26.210 --> 23:28.620
Oh, hey, it wasn't my idea.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.260
I mean, it was.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.850
I don't know, sweetie. I just.

23:32.860 --> 23:37.510
I got an instinct about this guy that
he's grateful for a place to stay,

23:37.540 --> 23:42.280
that he won't do anything, that he
won't, you know, take anything or...

23:42.290 --> 23:44.270
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.870
Any chance that he'll be gone by
the time we get home from school?

23:46.890 --> 23:50.000
Listen, Ariel, we all want
the same thing here, okay?

23:54.590 --> 23:57.060
Marie, what's going
on with you, sweetie?

23:58.060 --> 23:59.390
You're awfully quiet.

23:59.410 --> 24:02.610
She's sad about Mommy.
She wants her to come home.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.970
And she's worried that if
she doesn't come back in time,

24:05.980 --> 24:08.670
then she won't have a
costume for the school play.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.780
Hey, maybe, hopefully, Mommy
will come home today, huh?

24:11.810 --> 24:13.660
And if she doesn't then,
you know what we'll do?

24:13.690 --> 24:16.060
We'll find somebody else
to sew you a costume, okay?

24:16.080 --> 24:19.170
We'll do something. All right, sweetie?

24:19.180 --> 24:22.310
Hey, you. Don't you worry.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.410
Everything's going to be
back to normal real soon.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.700
Well, I don't know how to describe it.

24:28.720 --> 24:33.320
I mean, she's in the room, but it's as
if she's not really in the room at all.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.730
Well, I felt like I
had to come and visit.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.080
I agree with you now, dear.
It was probably pretty silly.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.130
I'll see you at dinner. Okay.

24:47.950 --> 24:50.410
I called your office, and
they said you were here.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.360
Uh, little visit.

25:04.910 --> 25:08.040
Doctors are completely baffled.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.660
Listen, I'll... I'll
leave the two of you alone.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.400
No, no. I-I need to give you something.

25:13.410 --> 25:17.690
Um, you and Allison were examining
a murder victim when she collapsed,

25:18.020 --> 25:20.690
and I know that you found some
hairs on his body that weren't his.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.930
Could you test and see
if these match those?

25:26.780 --> 25:29.260
I'm sorry. I guess I missed it, but
where did you say you got these from?

25:29.270 --> 25:31.440
And how do you know about
this murder investigation?

25:31.450 --> 25:33.570
I didn't. What does it matter?

25:33.580 --> 25:35.360
If those don't match, we
have nothing to talk about.

25:35.370 --> 25:38.490
And if they do, I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

25:39.090 --> 25:40.730
Don't look so confused.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.350
You've known me and my
family for a long time.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.370
You're quite right.

25:45.380 --> 25:48.400
Well, if you need anything, just...

26:10.530 --> 26:12.770
Todd Emory?

26:13.750 --> 26:16.620
I'm talking to you.

26:17.620 --> 26:20.970
We haven't met, but I'm the landlord.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.650
And I'm serving you
with an eviction notice.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.320
You've been warned.

26:33.870 --> 26:36.490
- Daddy, I'm home!
- Daddy, I'm home!

26:36.500 --> 26:37.850
Dad, I'm back. I have the keys.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.960
I've got the girls, and
I've got Ashley with...

26:44.230 --> 26:45.990
What are you doing?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.610
I'm trying to make a pea pod for peanut.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.330
Do you actually know what you're doing?

26:50.350 --> 26:53.750
Well, let's see. Come
here, you vegetable.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.590
Let's see what is looks like. Come on.

26:57.650 --> 27:03.130
Let's try this... on. Yeah. There we go.

27:05.590 --> 27:10.900
Now, was... was that
more like you had in mind?

27:11.480 --> 27:14.560
That looks almost as good
as something Mom would do.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.980
Well, I take that as a compliment.

27:16.990 --> 27:19.300
- Do I know you?
- No.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.000
None of us know him.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.940
Come on. Let's get you changed,
and I'll get you a snack.

27:24.950 --> 27:26.940
Go.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.600
Thank you.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.760
You're very welcome, sweetie.

27:32.770 --> 27:36.250
If Mommy's still sick and can't
come to the play, will you come?

27:36.260 --> 27:38.170
Marie! You know what? No. Come on.

27:38.180 --> 27:40.540
You couldn't keep me away.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.860
Bye now.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.880
Bye.

27:50.490 --> 27:52.040
Who is it?

27:52.060 --> 27:55.810
- Hey, are you in there?
- Yes. Is there a problem?

27:55.820 --> 27:57.920
Oh, I've been looking all over for you.

27:57.930 --> 28:02.060
Um, how did you get in there without the
girls seeing you coming down the hall?

28:02.100 --> 28:06.580
I went through the sliding glass door
in the kitchen, and I took the back way.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.970
Well, why are you-you talking
to me through the door?

28:09.990 --> 28:11.720
Why don't you just come in here?

28:11.750 --> 28:16.680
Ah, yeah, you know, if it's just
the same, I-I think I'd rather not.

28:16.710 --> 28:18.560
Oh, come on, Joe. It's ridiculous.

28:18.570 --> 28:21.640
There's nothing in here
that you haven't seen before.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.770
Oh, I beg to differ.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.380
Honestly.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.720
Um, here's the thing.

28:31.750 --> 28:37.400
Is, I-I think have to take the girls
to the hospital to visit you tonight.

28:37.410 --> 28:39.240
Visit Allison. Visit you.

28:39.250 --> 28:43.340
I-I dot think that I can keep this
thing under wraps for too much longer.

28:43.790 --> 28:47.560
I think that I have to
tell them about the coma.

28:48.270 --> 28:51.420
About you.

28:51.890 --> 28:57.350
And I... And I just want to let you know,
because things might get weird when we get home.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.560
Weirder.

29:00.590 --> 29:02.610
You're worried about Ariel, aren't you?

29:02.620 --> 29:05.620
Well, you think that she's angry now...

29:06.390 --> 29:08.990
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
I should just leave.

29:10.230 --> 29:13.940
And then all you have to explain
is the coma, and you just...

29:14.700 --> 29:17.690
you just spare them the rest.

29:18.210 --> 29:21.830
Well, you know, I thought
about that, but the thing is...

29:24.160 --> 29:27.540
I don't think that I want you to leave.

29:30.910 --> 29:32.390
Oh, my God.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.030
Well, are-are you expecting someone?

29:35.040 --> 29:38.530
No. Stay right here.
Don't let anyone see you.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.230
- Joe.
- Mr. District Attorney.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.210
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

29:47.970 --> 29:52.660
First of all, for what it's worth, those hairs
that you gave me this morning, they, um...

29:52.670 --> 29:56.760
They don't match the hairs that were
found on the body of that man in the park.

29:56.770 --> 30:01.720
So whoever's hairs those might have been, they
probably have nothing to fear from the police.

30:02.310 --> 30:06.040
All right. Well, I-I'm sure
that's a relief to someone.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.040
In the meantime, we have figured out just
whose body that is we found out there.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.470
Dead man was a private
investigator named Porter Hayes.

30:14.510 --> 30:17.050
Specialized in divorce work.

30:18.730 --> 30:21.610
Yeah, I know. You're thinking, "What
does any of this have to do with me?"

30:21.620 --> 30:24.940
Have you, um... have you
ever seen this man before?

30:28.750 --> 30:31.270
Only in the newspapers.

30:31.280 --> 30:36.250
The mother of one of your daughter's friends
called the reward hotline early this evening.

30:36.290 --> 30:41.000
Her little girl swears that she
saw this man in your house today.

30:44.630 --> 30:48.810
Like you said at that hospital this
morning, I've known you folks a long time.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.810
That hair that you gave
me?I'm no psychic, but, um,

30:51.820 --> 30:56.140
I have a very strong feeling that
it might belong to Todd Emory.

30:58.580 --> 31:02.240
Joe, if Todd Emory were here, if he
was hiding in your house, you'd...

31:02.270 --> 31:05.640
you'd tell me, right?

31:07.730 --> 31:10.070
I'm asking you a direct question.

31:10.110 --> 31:14.910
That man has been missing from the hospital for
two days now, and I think you know where he is.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.170
Is he here?

31:18.180 --> 31:21.400
Good evening, Mr. District Attorney.

31:23.460 --> 31:28.140
I'm Todd Emory. I think you're
asking some questions about me.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.840
He's gone.

31:40.850 --> 31:43.710
They took him back to the hospital.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.650
Okay, so, why do you look so sad?

31:47.010 --> 31:49.220
I mean, you didn't even know him, so...

31:49.230 --> 31:53.190
I think I convinced myself that
if I could help this guy, that...

31:53.810 --> 31:57.870
that somehow that would help
your mom get better, too.

31:57.890 --> 32:00.290
I know it doesn't make a lot of sense.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.220
- No, it doesn't.
- No.

32:13.420 --> 32:16.660
He took a picture of you
guys with him when he left.

32:19.110 --> 32:21.970
I'm sorry if this upset you.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.010
Okay.

32:29.140 --> 32:32.020
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, sweetie.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.580
Todd?

32:49.610 --> 32:53.540
Oh, you don't know who I am, do you?

32:57.920 --> 32:59.650
It's me.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.560
Sam.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.960
Samantha, your wife?

33:06.570 --> 33:08.670
Oh, God.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.640
The doctors said there'd
be some memory loss, but...

33:13.620 --> 33:16.950
I'm sorry. Oh, everything's just a...

33:17.440 --> 33:20.200
It's a bit of a blank right now.

33:20.210 --> 33:22.690
That's amazing.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.720
Even me? I'm a blank?

33:26.040 --> 33:28.830
We've been married for seven years.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.790
I'm sure everything is good...

33:32.800 --> 33:36.110
will come back soon.

33:37.590 --> 33:40.000
Oh, Todd.

33:45.040 --> 33:49.230
Todd... the night that you were hit...

33:50.290 --> 33:53.310
why were you out there
in the middle of nowhere?

33:53.320 --> 33:57.080
I'm sorry. I just... I
don't... I don't have any idea.

33:59.290 --> 34:04.280
The police said that they found
you in some strange family's house.

34:04.830 --> 34:07.530
I can't explain that.

34:07.540 --> 34:10.250
You don't remember
anything? Anything at all?

34:12.630 --> 34:15.960
Dead man was a private
investigator named Porter Hayes.

34:15.969 --> 34:18.840
Specialized in divorce work.

34:20.510 --> 34:25.170
Porter Hayes. I think he
was a private investigator.

34:25.929 --> 34:29.400
Yeah, for some reason,
that stuck in my head.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.360
Excuse me? Sorry to interrupt.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.699
I have a little something
to help Mr. Emory sleep.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.360
Doctor's orders.

35:17.110 --> 35:19.680
You did that really well, Todd.

35:20.870 --> 35:23.300
Maybe you missed your calling in life.

35:23.310 --> 35:26.300
Physical labor really seems to suit you.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.450
You didn't have to kill
him. And you don't have to...

35:30.850 --> 35:32.110
You don't have to kill me.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.280
Well, you didn't leave
me much wiggle room, Todd.

35:36.070 --> 35:39.170
We could have had a wonderful
life together, you and me.

35:39.790 --> 35:43.010
You and me, me and my flings, but no.

35:43.020 --> 35:47.120
You had to go and hire a private
investigator, get him to follow me around town,

35:47.160 --> 35:50.110
taking all of those pictures. Why?

35:50.780 --> 35:53.830
So you could divorce me
and leave me with nothing?

35:55.710 --> 35:59.330
I don't think you understand
how this game is played, dear.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.350
Go on. Get in the hole.

36:03.750 --> 36:06.810
Well, lie down. Make
yourself comfortable.

36:06.820 --> 36:09.600
You're going to be in there a while.

36:15.370 --> 36:17.190
So, what are you going to do?

36:17.220 --> 36:19.920
Are you going to shoot
me in the back of my head?

36:20.200 --> 36:22.100
Yeah.

36:22.130 --> 36:25.550
But I am going to have beautiful
thoughts about you while I do it.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.760
Oh, you...

36:36.470 --> 36:38.700
You shot me!

36:39.480 --> 36:41.960
I can't believe that you shot me!

36:43.610 --> 36:45.400
Well, you were going to shoot me.

36:45.410 --> 36:49.360
- In the back of my head.
- No! No!

36:59.130 --> 37:02.350
Oh, goodness. What's going on?

37:02.360 --> 37:04.600
Something wake you, darling?

37:04.610 --> 37:06.020
Oh, something's gone wrong.

37:06.030 --> 37:07.940
Oh, please call for help.

37:07.970 --> 37:11.130
Nothing's wrong. It'll all be over soon.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.760
That pain that you're feeling?

37:12.800 --> 37:15.970
That's just the air bubble that
I've injected into your IV line.

37:15.990 --> 37:20.060
In just a few moments, it will reach
your brain, and all the pain will be gone.

37:21.120 --> 37:26.010
No! No! No! No, no, it'll all be done by the
time the nurses finish their shift change.

37:26.020 --> 37:28.210
Don't fight it, Todd.

37:28.250 --> 37:31.150
This is just the way that it has to be.

37:34.020 --> 37:38.070
Please. Please don't do this. Please?

37:38.560 --> 37:41.370
Page Dr. Ancheta at home.
His patient in 404 is coding.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.780
404? What's the patient's name?

37:42.790 --> 37:45.400
Emory. Todd Emory.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.410
I don't know what happened.
He just started convulsing.

37:54.420 --> 37:57.110
Charging at 200.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.490
Shocking at 200

38:01.530 --> 38:03.750
Oh, God. Allison.

38:04.640 --> 38:09.110
Clear. Get ready for some Epi...

38:09.120 --> 38:11.520
Joe?

38:12.600 --> 38:15.380
Allison.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.020
No. Actually, I'm Todd.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.340
I'm Todd Emory.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.450
- What?
- I'm sorry. I wish I could explain.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.640
I just woke up.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.150
It's like I've been asleep for days.

38:31.170 --> 38:33.110
The things that I've seen.

38:33.150 --> 38:35.470
Oh, the things that I've dreamt.

38:35.490 --> 38:38.710
I know what your wife has done for me.

38:38.720 --> 38:43.470
And I know what my wife did to me.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.390
Come on, Mr. Emory. Come back.

38:50.110 --> 38:54.090
Charing at 260...

38:54.100 --> 38:55.910
Clear!

38:56.400 --> 38:58.810
- darling.
- Darling.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.980
Shame on you!

39:02.760 --> 39:06.980
Shame on you! You damn
near killed that man's wife!

39:07.970 --> 39:11.080
Excuse me? Are you...
are you talking to me?

39:11.630 --> 39:14.650
Who is this? Who are you? And who are you?

39:14.660 --> 39:17.210
He... He is a wonderful man.

39:17.220 --> 39:21.410
And that-that... That is
his wonderful wife! And I...

39:22.560 --> 39:25.210
I'm your husband.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.140
The one you've been trying
to kill for the last two days.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.480
Someone call security!

39:29.510 --> 39:31.950
This woman is crazy! I want her
out of here! What is she doing here?

39:31.960 --> 39:33.700
Mrs. Dubois, why don't
we get you to your room.

39:33.730 --> 39:37.110
You waited all night until the
nurses went on their shift change.

39:37.130 --> 39:43.110
And then you injected an air
bubble into my I.V. into his I.V.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.070
And that was after she tried
to shoot me in the woods,

39:46.110 --> 39:49.620
so she could bury me along with the
private investigator she'd already killed.

39:49.630 --> 39:50.250
Clear!

39:50.270 --> 39:53.230
I have no idea what this
woman is talking about.

39:53.240 --> 39:56.380
Tell that district attorney fellow
who was at your house last night.

39:56.410 --> 40:00.060
We have some new hair to test. Her hair.

40:00.070 --> 40:02.340
Come on! Come on! Give
us some of your hair!

40:02.350 --> 40:05.700
If no one is going to escort these
people out of here, then I am leaving.

40:05.730 --> 40:09.580
She's leaving. And she's
taking her hair with her.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.900
Allison?

40:26.190 --> 40:28.110
Todd?

40:29.450 --> 40:31.910
Anybody?

40:37.110 --> 40:39.470
He's coming back.

40:43.450 --> 40:46.560
Take my wife. Please.

40:47.310 --> 40:49.060
Take my wife.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.620
Please.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.390
Be my wife. Be my wife.

40:53.970 --> 40:56.700
Please be my wife.

40:56.730 --> 40:59.760
I would love to be your wife.

41:00.950 --> 41:03.840
Wait a second. I already am.

41:17.220 --> 41:21.750
Samantha Emory, the young woman arrested
at White Peaks Hospital earlier in the week

41:21.780 --> 41:23.940
for the attempted murder of her husband,

41:23.990 --> 41:28.390
was also charged today in the murder
of private investigator Porter Hayes,

41:28.420 --> 41:31.700
as DNA tests place her at the location.

41:32.280 --> 41:36.150
Girls! Hurry up! We got to meet
your dad, and we're going to be late.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.620
I'm just saying. I hope the school
play ends differently this year.

41:39.630 --> 41:44.030
I mean, maybe this year, it'll turn out that
vegetables are actually bad for you.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.860
Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.

41:45.880 --> 41:48.320
Well, where's Marie?

41:48.330 --> 41:51.280
I'm a pea pod I'm part
the vegetable group.

41:51.320 --> 41:56.530
To maintain a healthy diet, you should
have three to five servings of me per day.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.330
Yes!

41:58.600 --> 42:00.860
Honey, that was wonderful!

42:01.320 --> 42:03.480
Oh, sweetie, great!

42:03.530 --> 42:06.190
But we got to get going. We're going to
be late. We have to pick up Uncle Todd.

42:06.200 --> 42:09.350
Mommy, Uncle Todd made me my costume.

42:09.630 --> 42:11.580
I know. Wasn't that nice of him?

42:11.940 --> 42:14.910
He did a really good job.
Almost as good as you.

42:16.540 --> 42:18.960
You don't say.
