00:11.680 --> 00:14.040
Tonight, Richard has a crisis...

00:16.079 --> 00:18.920
..some sheep on our track,

00:18.920 --> 00:21.960
and James and I go
to the lavatory.

00:29.280 --> 00:35.080
Good evening! Hello! Hello,
everybody. Thank you very much!

00:35.080 --> 00:36.720
Thank you very much! Thank you!

00:36.720 --> 00:38.960
Thank you!

00:38.960 --> 00:42.880
Yes, and welcome to the
final show in the series.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.440
AUDIENCE: Ah!

00:45.440 --> 00:48.280
Sad. Now, as I'm sure you know,

00:48.280 --> 00:53.600
we don't often do consumer advice
on this show. But tonight, we are.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.360
Because, if you were in the market
for a large, fast, spacious,

00:57.360 --> 01:01.400
executive saloon car, you'd imagine
that you'd be spoilt for choice.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.720
Me, too.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.760
However, Richard Hammond,
who is quite mad,

01:05.760 --> 01:10.560
has decided that every single one
of them has a fatal flaw.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.560
It really doesn't matter
which one you pick.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.640
Take this, for example - the Audi S4.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.320
Yes, it's fast, and it's
well built, and it's safe.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.120
But it has one big problem -

01:26.120 --> 01:29.280
it's built entirely for businessmen.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.280
And real businessmen are not
The Apprentice,

01:32.280 --> 01:36.200
Dragons' Den, Richard Branson, all
helicopters and hostile takeovers.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.240
They're actually quite dull.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.000
And work in Swindon.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.960
Their cars aren't cars.

01:43.960 --> 01:47.320
They're uniforms -
silver or black paint,

01:47.320 --> 01:50.720
maybe a splash of wood on the dash,
and that's your lot.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.200
It doesn't matter where you go -
Audi, Mercedes, BMW - they're all
so obsessed with what each other

01:56.200 --> 02:01.240
is doing that they all end up
making exactly the same car.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.520
So, if you don't want a businessman's
sports saloon, what do you do?

02:08.520 --> 02:12.000
Especially if, like me,
you're a bit of a...

02:13.680 --> 02:17.600
Yes, what we need right now is
something to come and save the day.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.200
This looks promising.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.680
If you were watching
earlier in the series,

02:29.680 --> 02:31.960
you'll have seen Jeremy
going on about a car

02:31.960 --> 02:35.560
that sounds like it's having
a Lady Chatterley crisis.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.960
And this is it.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.480
The Vauxhall VXR8 Bathurst edition.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.040
The interesting bit
there is the Bathurst bit.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.120
Because this car is Australian,

02:49.120 --> 02:53.480
and the Bathurst is Australia's
most famous race.

02:53.480 --> 02:57.560
Basically, it's a place where
Holden and Ford fans go to
have a massive fist fight.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.240
And then in the interval,
when the paramedics go in,

03:00.240 --> 03:02.560
sometimes a car race breaks out.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.240
And this car, with its
supercharged 6.2 litre V8,

03:08.240 --> 03:10.800
is one hell of a fist fight.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.000
I just love the sound
of a supercharger.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.680
That whine, you can hear it now,
that shriek.

03:16.680 --> 03:21.560
It's an Outback choir, you've got
the tenor of the supercharger,

03:21.560 --> 03:23.320
and then the base of the V8.

03:24.960 --> 03:30.240
And it gets better, this button here,
it says "Bimodal" on it.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.960
And if I press that,
it adjusts valves and things,

03:32.960 --> 03:36.040
in the exhaust system,
and makes it louder.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.920
What this car does is go to 11.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.920
I fear that anyone
who likes the Bathurst

03:44.920 --> 03:47.200
is probably quite a bad businessman.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.320
The world of PowerPoints
will not take you seriously.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.080
But the consolation is, when your
business does eventually go bust,

03:55.080 --> 04:00.120
there's no way in hell will the
bailiff will ever catch you! Ha-ha!

04:00.120 --> 04:04.920
0-60 takes just 4.6 seconds.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.600
Top speed, a limited 155mph.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.480
Of course,
the Germans will do that, too.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.040
But they won't dish out as
much fun when you do this.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.519
HE LAUGHS

04:21.880 --> 04:24.600
Apparently,
the suspension is adjustable.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.320
Presumably from oversteer, to,
"Oh, dear, we've just crashed!"

04:31.560 --> 04:32.600
RICHARD LAUGHS

04:32.600 --> 04:35.360
Just astonishing!

04:35.360 --> 04:39.880
I'm sorry, if this car doesn't
move you, that is your problem,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.880
not the car's. It's just a fact.

04:45.680 --> 04:52.160
It costs £45,000, and for that,
you get almost limitless vulgarity.

04:52.160 --> 04:57.760
No spoiler is too big.
No vent is too gaping.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.200
No supercharger too red.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.080
In short, the perfect fast saloon
for anyone who's not a businessman.

05:06.080 --> 05:13.960
I'm thinking, actors, vicars,
professors, erm, children.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.640
But what if you're a
builder or a farmer,

05:17.640 --> 05:21.440
or anyone who has to move
around loads of stuff?

05:21.440 --> 05:24.800
They really are in a petrol-head
wasteland, because often as not,

05:24.800 --> 05:29.000
they have to drive about in
something as slow and dull as this.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.760
I'm sure it's practical,
but 0-60 comes up in...

05:32.760 --> 05:35.960
well, I've been on the go some time
and it hasn't happened yet.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.880
And that's just not fair.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.680
Ideally, what you need is a
combination of that...and that.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.600
If only such a thing existed.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.080
And for the second time today,

05:54.080 --> 05:58.160
unfortunately, it's Australia
that comes to the rescue.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.360
This is called the Maloo, which,
in Aborigine, means thunder.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.840
Now, strictly speaking,
because it's Australian,

06:13.840 --> 06:16.480
this isn't a pick-up, it's a ute.

06:16.480 --> 06:20.840
And you can now buy it in
this country for £37,000,

06:20.840 --> 06:22.440
which sounds like quite a lot.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.600
But you haven't seen yet how it
can enrich your life.

06:27.760 --> 06:33.280
Say you're at the lights next to
the IT boy in his supercharged Audi.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.960
ENGINES REV

06:34.960 --> 06:37.640
In a normal pick-up,
when the lights went green,

06:37.640 --> 06:41.000
he'd leave you in a cloud
of business dust.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.280
Not in this one.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.120
Reining him in! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

06:53.920 --> 06:55.040
I'm sorry, fella!

06:55.040 --> 06:57.080
This is the fastest ute in the world.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.640
0-60, five seconds.
Top speed, limited to 155.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.400
That means you can
worry people in 911s.

07:07.400 --> 07:13.800
And it's all down to a huge
419 horsepower, 6.2 litre V8.

07:15.120 --> 07:20.960
But that's enough maths. Time
for a quick ute history lesson.

07:20.960 --> 07:25.440
It started in the 1930s,
when a farmer's wife wrote
to Ford of Australia,

07:25.440 --> 07:29.520
complaining that there was no car
that could take her to church
on a Sunday,

07:29.520 --> 07:31.960
and the pigs to market on a Monday.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.720
The answer was, the ute,
and the Australians

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
have worshipped them ever since.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.840
You might think that because it's
basically a piece of farm machinery

07:42.840 --> 07:47.400
with a big engine, drag racing
is all it can do. Not so.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.600
The Maloo loves corners.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.360
In fact, it gets a bit carried away.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.560
Ha-ha!

08:04.840 --> 08:09.960
Yep, there's no weight on the
back end, so it is a bit lively!

08:13.000 --> 08:16.440
And adding weight to the back
doesn't work that well, either.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.960
Oh, no!

08:20.960 --> 08:25.240
My hay-based solution system
needs refining, but the fact is,

08:25.240 --> 08:30.160
the next time you wake up and realise
that you're not a businessman,

08:30.160 --> 08:32.400
but you like a fast car...

08:34.200 --> 08:37.120
..remember, the Aussies
are here to help.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:52.560 --> 08:55.680
I had a good point,
it's a good point.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.000
Is that your idea of
consumer advice? Yes.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.040
You really are a steak and kidney
lock opener, aren't you? Oh, yes.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.640
But we must now find how fast
these cars go round our track.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.080
And that of course means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.840
Some say that he cut
that man's hair.

09:17.920 --> 09:24.360
And that if HE compensated a soldier
for getting wounded, he wouldn't
try to take it all back again.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.080
CHEERING

09:26.080 --> 09:27.840
All we know is,
he's called the Stig!

09:28.920 --> 09:30.520
And they're off.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.840
Extraordinary whining from
the Bathurst, just distant

09:33.840 --> 09:38.320
thunder from the Maloo,
as they go down to the first corner.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.440
Straightaway, the front heavy
ute is getting frisky.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.400
Bathurst responding, with a slide!

09:48.280 --> 09:52.760
Oh, my God, how many bagpipes
are we hearing there? Two? Seven?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.000
One, with a hole in it?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.240
He's round Chicago
and now we're at Hammerhead.

09:58.240 --> 10:03.000
Maloo does not look like the easiest
thing in the world to drive.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.360
And the Bathurst is just a
supercharged portable drift machine.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.720
Look at it! Fantastic.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.800
That is literally the most painful
drone I've heard

10:19.800 --> 10:23.560
since James tried to explain
fuel-injection to me.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.320
Two corners left.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.640
Bathurst's really getting its
tail out. And now, if we look,

10:28.640 --> 10:33.200
the Maloo is as well! Sideways
cars from an upside-down country!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

10:35.040 --> 10:41.480
OK. You first, Hammond.
OK. Your pick-up truck.

10:41.480 --> 10:46.600
My pick-up truck did it in 1.27.1.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.160
It's as fast as an Aston Martin DB9.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.800
That's unbelievable!

10:50.800 --> 10:52.960
What a car!

10:54.360 --> 10:57.440
Hang on, the Bathurst...

10:57.440 --> 11:02.800
the Bathurst did it in 1.26.3.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.400
So it's about the same as a BMW M5.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.920
And that really does make
it the perfect car

11:08.920 --> 11:11.880
for anyone whose business is
selling pegs and heather.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.360
And now the news and the big
news this week is a new Ferrari.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.680
Here it is. It's the F430
Scuderia convertible.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.920
And if you are one of the 499 people
who have ordered one of those,

11:26.920 --> 11:30.640
all we have to say to you is,
"You big daft cock."

11:32.400 --> 11:34.960
Big mistake. Error.
A massive mistake.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.800
Because while you were doing that,
Ferrari were working on this.

11:37.800 --> 11:43.160
This is the replacement. Well,
yes, exactly. That's the 458 Italia.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.680
And I have to say, from the front,
it looks absolutely exquisite,

11:47.680 --> 11:51.280
but from the back, it looks even
exquisiter. How do you feel now?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.240
How do you feel now?

11:53.240 --> 11:58.360
It's just beautiful. And what's
more, this is fantastic to drive.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.040
How can you possibly know that?

12:00.040 --> 12:02.200
Nobody's driven it yet.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.520
Because, a-ha! History teaches us
this, because every single time

12:05.520 --> 12:10.320
the Ferrari Formula One team
is doing well, their road cars
are rubbish.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.640
And every time their Formula One
car is doing badly, their road
cars are brilliant.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.800
And this year,
do you see what I'm saying?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.360
They can't win anything,
even an egg-and-spoon race.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.880
He's right. The problem is,

12:20.880 --> 12:23.520
if you've only got 100 people
working for you

12:23.520 --> 12:28.200
and 50 of them are completely
bogged down designing a
windscreen wiper for a road car,

12:28.200 --> 12:31.480
you haven't got enough people
left to win the championship.

12:31.480 --> 12:36.840
And do you know why? Formula One
cars are designed by men and men
cannot do two things at once.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.960
No, that's a good point. We can't.
Am I right? Yes, exactly.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.920
We'll admit that,
we cannot multi-task.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.120
"Don't ask me now, I'm
putting this pen away.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.760
"Now you can talk. Hold on.

12:48.760 --> 12:53.200
"OK, talk now. I breathed in.
Hold, I'm breathing out."
We can't do two...

12:53.200 --> 12:57.920
Just breathing in and breathing out.
Is enough for us to be occupied.
Absolutely.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.720
Now, people, can I just get serious
for a moment? Would you mind?

13:01.720 --> 13:06.640
It's just that we've heard that
over in Amsterdam at night,
various drunken louts,

13:06.640 --> 13:09.600
there's no other word for them,
have been picking up Smart cars,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.520
and throwing them into the canal.
We've got a picture here.

13:12.520 --> 13:17.880
Seriously. No, no, no...really.
Apparently, it only takes four
people

13:17.880 --> 13:20.560
to pick one of those things up
and just lob it in the drink.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.720
Now, I bring this up because
I'm just slightly worried

13:23.720 --> 13:28.240
that over here in England people
might start picking up those
little electric gee-whizzes,

13:28.240 --> 13:32.680
and throwing them in the river.
Can you imagine how awful that
would be for Mr Weird-beard

13:32.680 --> 13:35.440
if his pride and joy were to
find itself in the Thames?

13:35.440 --> 13:39.280
I really cannot urge you
enough not to do that.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.760
Thinking about it, if you did lob
an electric car into a river,
wouldn't it kill all the fish?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.080
Zzz! And they'd all float on the top.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.000
Would it do that?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.920
Are there any electricians here?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.400
Yes. Would it electrocute...

13:53.400 --> 13:55.520
Why aren't you at work?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.720
Would it electrocute the fish?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.240
No. Why?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.560
The voltage is too
low and the amps...

14:04.560 --> 14:10.040
So it turns out it's fine to
throw a gee-whizz into a canal.
Can't advise that. Yeah, it's OK.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.960
I'm not convinced by that,
though, because I think
electricity is a mystery.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.720
It is.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.560
I don't actually believe in it.
You don't believe in electricity?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.240
No, nobody really understands it.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.120
What you are witnessing
here is Asperger's made real.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.200
Is that what makes my
wee smell funny? No!

14:34.200 --> 14:36.280
Oh, no, that's asparagus.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.680
Now, you may have heard a
few days ago that Michael Schumacher

14:43.680 --> 14:46.800
is standing in for the
injured Felipe Massa, OK?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.760
Interesting timing. This is the
last programme in our series.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.840
No more cars to test till
November on the track.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.120
Suddenly, he's available.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.280
We're not saying anything,
it's just those are the facts.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
Those are simply the facts.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.800
Actually, I do want to
talk about Felipe Massa.

15:04.800 --> 15:10.560
Obviously, he was injured
in the Hungarian Grand Prix
when a spring hit him

15:10.560 --> 15:14.840
in the face at 140mph.
I'm just staggered he wasn't killed!

15:14.840 --> 15:17.880
Yes, because he weighs about
the same as what, a bag of sugar?

15:17.880 --> 15:21.040
The thing is, he was wearing one
of those new regulation carbon-fibre

15:21.040 --> 15:24.960
crash helmets and they are
unbelievably strong.

15:24.960 --> 15:29.400
Because the injuries he's got,
as far as I can work out, are
very similar to the ones you got.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.600
Yes, possibly, yes.
Frontal lobe damage,

15:31.600 --> 15:37.520
so that's personality, emotional
control, spatial awareness, all of
that. Hopefully getting better.

15:37.520 --> 15:41.760
Does that mean that if he
gets better - and, God,
we're all praying he does -

15:41.760 --> 15:45.120
that he's going to become an
irritating little arse?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.880
I mean, it's a thought.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.840
It could. You never know
with brain damage.

15:56.840 --> 16:00.440
Or he could come back to work
and discover the people he
works with are,

16:00.440 --> 16:03.480
well, they've become quite
incredibly irritating.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.280
And quite fat. It can happen.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.840
Anyway, look, Felipe, I
know you're not watching

16:09.840 --> 16:13.360
because you're in Italy or wherever,
but we are thinking of you.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.320
Everybody here wishes you a
speedy recovery. Good luck.

16:22.400 --> 16:27.640
Now, you know we used to say in the
olden days that all bad drivers

16:27.640 --> 16:30.840
drove Volvos, particularly bikers,
OK? Now this was a good thing,

16:30.840 --> 16:33.040
because you knew where the bad
drivers were.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.440
You saw a Volvo, you knew it
was a bad driver. All was well.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.280
Then Volvo started making good cars,
the T5 and so on,

16:39.280 --> 16:44.040
the bad drivers dispersed.
We didn't know what they were in.
So what are the bad drivers in?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.800
I think quite a few
ended up in Micras.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.680
Nissan Micras?
You might be right, yeah.

16:47.680 --> 16:51.520
I think quite a few
ended up in Kia Sedonas.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.040
I think Korean cars in general.
If I see one coming towards me,
I pull over,

16:55.040 --> 16:58.280
get out, hide behind a
tree until it's gone.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.960
You just don't want
to take any chances.

16:59.960 --> 17:05.560
The thing is this, if you buy a
rubbish car, what you are saying
is, "I have no interest in cars."

17:05.560 --> 17:10.000
If you have no interest in cars,
you have none in driving. If you
have no interest in something,

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
it means you're no good at it,
which means you must have your
driving licence taken away.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.560
I went on the internet this week
to compile a series of clips

17:18.560 --> 17:22.000
of people having parking accidents,
you know, minor bumps and scrapes.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.599
See if you can spot something
that all the cars have in common?

17:25.599 --> 17:28.160
Here we go.
Now what's that? That's a...

17:28.160 --> 17:30.520
Which one are we looking at?
That one? That's a Hondo.

17:32.160 --> 17:36.760
We're not talking here about a
good driver, are we? Because
they've got the pedals muddled up.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.400
OK, right, it's a Skoda!

17:39.400 --> 17:41.920
Big gate there. Oh dear, no.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.040
Worst car in the world, is it...
It is, it's a Neon.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.360
I believe this to
be a Chrysler Neon.

17:54.360 --> 17:59.480
Anybody driving one of those,
take their licence away
or that will happen.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.760
It's incredible!
I think that is a Pontiac.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.000
Yes! That's gone wrong.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.720
Now here we are, we're
in Britain for this one.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.040
That's a bad driver, he's
got a bus but he's made it.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.440
And here comes the Honda! Oh! No!

18:21.960 --> 18:27.200
It's a perfectly valid theory
because if you had absolutely
no interest whatsoever in how

18:27.200 --> 18:30.960
the human body worked, you wouldn't
get a job as a surgeon, would you?

18:30.960 --> 18:34.800
If you haven't got the interest,
you can't do it. You shouldn't be
allowed to do it.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.080
Exactly. I mean, it would be like
asking him to cook Sunday lunch.

18:38.080 --> 18:43.120
Could you cook a Sunday lunch?
Yeah, you boil the meat
or whatever... You see?

18:43.120 --> 18:46.600
I'm not interested in food, so
I'm not interested in cooking.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.000
There you are. You wouldn't ask him,
because he's not interested,
to cook you any food.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.880
You wouldn't ask me to do the
washing up, you wouldn't ask
James to direct a porn film.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.160
You say that. I think I'd actually
direct quite a good porn film.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.680
If you directed a porn film,
it would be you arriving

19:06.680 --> 19:09.200
at the house of the woman in
the stockings and negligee.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.920
"I've come to fix your boiler."
And then you'd just fix it.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.640
Might do. What's wrong with that?

19:20.200 --> 19:25.440
Now, that is the end of the news. So
we are going to move on with this.

19:25.440 --> 19:31.160
Ever since 1963, when Volkswagen
invented the concept

19:31.160 --> 19:36.360
of modern television advertising,
they have been king of the hill. OK?

19:36.360 --> 19:40.040
And they still are,
thanks to ads like this.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.320
This is the man
who put a million on black...

19:45.320 --> 19:47.280
and it came up red.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.440
This is the man who
married a sex kitten,

19:53.440 --> 19:56.680
just as she turned into a cat.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.880
This is the man who moved into gold,

20:00.880 --> 20:03.360
just as the clever money moved out.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.000
This is the man...who drives...

20:12.000 --> 20:14.320
a Volkswagen.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.160
Everyone must have something in life
he can rely on.

20:19.160 --> 20:24.880
Now that's all very well, but you
see, every week we make films in
which the clouds go backwards,

20:24.880 --> 20:31.280
a super car spins around, metaphors
get tortured, and they last for
what, five minutes, six minutes?

20:31.280 --> 20:37.720
Yes, quite. So how hard can it be
for us to make a car advert,
which is over in 30 seconds?

20:37.720 --> 20:42.880
Well, the producers decided
that James and I should find out.

20:45.480 --> 20:50.920
Feeling like candidates for
The Apprentice, the two of
us got dressed up as ad men,

20:50.920 --> 20:56.040
and went to the glittering West
London offices of Goodyear,
Stickleback and Bunsen burner.

20:58.320 --> 21:05.240
There, the ad execs showed us
the car we'd be advertising - a
diesel version of the new Scirocco.

21:06.720 --> 21:12.600
What would be your suggestions,
to do a commercial for a Volkswagen?

21:12.600 --> 21:16.400
At the heart of all good
Volkswagen advertising,
there is always a product truth.

21:16.400 --> 21:22.200
It's not sort of flimflam, it's
always based on a truth that
comes directly from the product.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.280
But you never did one
that said, "The new Beetle -

21:24.280 --> 21:27.640
"celebrating over half a century of
Europe's greatest mass murderer."

21:27.640 --> 21:31.680
No, cos you pick on a truth
that matters, you idiot. What?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.360
You pick on a truth that matters.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.040
I think what you're saying
is, if you take Peugeot,
"The drive of your life,"

21:38.040 --> 21:42.720
that line has nothing to do
with any Peugeot product,
all of which are dreadful.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.840
It's just an ad man went, "The drive
of your life" is a good line.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.600
That's that point there about
you've got to look for it,
you've got to try the product out,

21:50.600 --> 21:56.320
you've got to drive it,
experience it, and find out what
the real truths of the product are.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.400
We ought to go to drive the car.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.840
At first, things were looking good.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.920
The clever thing about this is,
it doesn't really cost all
that much more than a Golf.

22:08.920 --> 22:16.160
So, it costs the same as the Golf,
but you stand out because you've got
a Scirocco, which is better-looking.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.240
Quality is exceptional.

22:19.240 --> 22:23.880
Just the fit and finish of
everything in here is superb. Yes.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.360
It's practical for a coupe.

22:26.360 --> 22:32.080
I don't know of any coupe
currently made that's got more
space in the back then this has.

22:34.320 --> 22:38.720
Right, let's try some sporty
driving and see if it's sporty.
I'm gonna put it into sport.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.880
And here, on twisting,
country lanes, there weren't
any problems, either.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.440
Brakes?
The brakes are good, actually.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.080
The brakes are good,
steering's good.

22:50.080 --> 22:54.680
So what you're saying is, as a
sporty car, it's pretty good? Yes.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.760
But, we then got
to the elephant in the corner.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.720
Right, come on.
Is it fast? Put your foot down.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.000
BOTH: Not.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.120
So, that's a good five seconds of
absolutely nothing in fourth gear.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.800
But if I change to third, OK...

23:15.800 --> 23:18.920
Right. ..then I run out of puff, so
I've got to go back to fourth again!

23:18.920 --> 23:23.520
It's the same as all diesels,
you have just a morsel,
and then it's gone.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.560
So, performance? No. No.

23:28.160 --> 23:34.040
The bottom line is this -
this particular Scirocco
is a good car, ruined.

23:34.040 --> 23:37.080
We both agree, do we not?
The car is a stupid idea.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.280
A car that looks like this
should have a petrol engine.

23:40.280 --> 23:44.440
Let's make that absolutely clear.
Our personal view is that you
should not buy this car.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.920
However, we are now charged
with selling it.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.480
So, what? What?

23:53.440 --> 23:57.440
Back in Apprentice land,
we outlined the problem.

23:57.440 --> 24:03.160
As far as I can make out, the
Volkswagen Scirocco is a pretty car,
and what they've done is,

24:03.160 --> 24:06.240
they've put the engine
from a canal boat in it.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.040
And we have to somehow make
that seem like a good thing.

24:10.040 --> 24:14.280
The idea of building that sort
of car with that sort of engine
deserves the strap line,

24:14.280 --> 24:16.200
"What the bloody hell
were you thinking of?"

24:16.200 --> 24:18.200
Which isn't really going
to work as an advert.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.080
It's not, no. You're starting from
a negative, where you should

24:21.080 --> 24:24.400
start from a positive. You're
saying, "You've ruined a Scirocco."

24:24.400 --> 24:27.280
Whereas, you should be saying,
"You've improved diesel." Ah!

24:27.280 --> 24:31.960
So that you make diesel more
exciting, rather than make
Scirocco less exciting.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.880
Edward de Bono here has hit
it on the head. We've made
diesel more interesting.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.760
Not VW Scirocco less interesting.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.440
You see, that's why he's
sitting there.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.080
And we're sitting here
in rubbish clothes.

24:43.080 --> 24:46.800
James and I then tried
some blue-sky thinking.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.280
Imagine, if it just said,
"Volkswagen Scirocco," across
the screen, "Diesel."

24:51.280 --> 24:54.320
And then a polar bear just
stood there and just went, "BOOM!"

24:56.040 --> 24:58.520
No. I'm going wrong.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.320
What if we do a campaign based
around the idea of great
ecclesiastical figures,

25:02.320 --> 25:07.920
from Thomas Becket down - would have
driven, had they had the chance,
the Scirocco diesel?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.680
Cos it would be shit.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.280
OK, what about the car just
approaching in the distance,

25:13.280 --> 25:17.640
so you've got the advertising stuff
with the road, that famous road that
they use in Spain,

25:17.640 --> 25:21.360
where it winds round and the
hills...you've got swelling music,
and the Scirocco.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.480
No, that's a cliche.
I would just stop right there.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.080
Are you listening to this, James?

25:26.080 --> 25:31.920
An advert has to say almost nothing.
It's just got to go...WOW!

25:31.920 --> 25:34.600
Hasn't it? And BANG!
With a huge explosion.

25:36.120 --> 25:42.560
Well, point five on how to do a
Volkswagen ad is, "Speak to the
reader, don't shout, he can hear you.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.360
"Especially if you talk sense."

25:44.360 --> 25:48.680
You don't blow his head off.
It's important that the advertising
has intelligence.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.000
It can't just be explosions.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.200
Feeling like ad men,
we went to the lavatory.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.040
And then we went to the track,
where I let Jeremy make our
first intelligent advertisement.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.600
The new VW Scirocco Diesel.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.960
It's explosive!

26:16.480 --> 26:19.040
What d'you think of that?
It's rubbish.

26:19.040 --> 26:23.680
Why is it rubbish?
It's not funny, and it's not true.

26:23.680 --> 26:29.000
We've been to see those clever
blokes in the agency, they've told
us what VW advertising is like,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.760
how can you hint at 55 miles per
gallon, with an explosion?

26:32.760 --> 26:34.080
Well, what have you got?

26:40.040 --> 26:44.760
The new VW Scirocco Diesel
produces 138 horsepower,

26:44.760 --> 26:48.600
and 236lb/ft of torque.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.320
So, it's faster
than you might think.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.360
And there's room in the back
for your mother-in-law.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.400
Unfortunately!

27:01.840 --> 27:06.240
'The Scirocco TDI - your
mother-in-law will love it.'

27:06.240 --> 27:09.880
That's the worst advert I've
ever seen. Your criticisms?

27:09.880 --> 27:13.480
Way, way too much information.
And mother-in-law jokes, James,
I mean...

27:13.480 --> 27:15.560
I'm identifying my market.

27:15.560 --> 27:20.680
They're old people,
old people made mother-in-law jokes,
that'll make them feel useful.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.080
Why didn't you get someone
blacked-up going,
"The Camptown Races"?

27:24.080 --> 27:26.760
Cos they used to watch the
Black And White Minstrel Show?

27:26.760 --> 27:30.760
James, it's not an idea.
You can't tell mother-in-law jokes.

27:30.760 --> 27:35.120
I fear you and I, we're going down
two very separate roads here.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.200
James decided to do more
blue-sky thinking,

27:39.200 --> 27:42.640
while I rushed off to make an ad
that had no explosions in it.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.280
Here we go.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.800
Yeah, I was in a terrible accident.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.160
Well, I ran out of petrol,
I was on the hard shoulder

27:53.160 --> 27:56.680
waiting for the breakdown van,
and I was hit by this massive truck.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.680
Yeah, that happens a lot.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.680
But it won't happen to me.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.080
I've got the new Scirocco Diesel.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.760
It does 55 mpg!

28:10.440 --> 28:12.440
'The new Scirocco TDI -

28:12.440 --> 28:15.760
'for people who value their arms.'

28:17.680 --> 28:21.120
So, the VW Scirocco driver
is deeply unpleasant?

28:21.120 --> 28:22.920
He's not deeply unpleasant,
it's funny!

28:22.920 --> 28:25.600
Children love a bit of that.
Old people love a bit of blood.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.720
Old people won't like that.
It reminds them of the Blitz.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.160
Think of the customer.
You're saying, "Buy this car

28:31.160 --> 28:35.520
"if you're smug and you revel
in other people's misfortune."
You can't put that on a car ad!

28:35.520 --> 28:38.960
He's offering him advice! He's
saying, "Get a Scirocco Diesel..."

28:38.960 --> 28:42.640
It's a bit late, his arm's come off!
He'll have the other arm!

28:42.640 --> 28:45.760
OK, close-up on
Jeremy's tongue, please.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.040
We pressed on with some more ideas.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.280
She loves me not... Action!

28:55.320 --> 28:57.440
I bet you any money
this stays intact.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.400
Did it? No.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.240
Right, right, right.
Right, right, right. Left! Left!

29:04.240 --> 29:08.040
James then decided
we needed a jingle.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.800
# Diesel Scirocco

29:10.800 --> 29:13.840
# Gets you down to Morocco

29:13.840 --> 29:17.040
# On one fill-up of diesel

29:17.040 --> 29:19.400
# At 55 mpg-iesel... #

29:19.400 --> 29:23.480
Then I decided we
didn't need a jingle.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.840
Yes! They're here!
Imagine now, James.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.920
Explosion! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

29:28.920 --> 29:31.920
Massive fire coming
from the gunship...

29:31.920 --> 29:34.960
Left, left, left!
Right, right! Left, left, left!

29:34.960 --> 29:37.640
Oh, for God's sake!

29:37.640 --> 29:41.040
Action. The New Scirocco Diesel.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.080
Truly biblical economy.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.680
This isn't working, is it?
I'm sorry.

29:49.280 --> 29:55.040
Finally, after much trial and
error, we had an ad that we
could show to the Alan Sugars.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.960
Check this out.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.760
This is the new Scirocco TDI.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.560
It's pretty fast.

30:17.360 --> 30:22.600
But a Mazda RX8
will kick its backside.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.960
And an Alfa Brera
will vomit in its face.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.000
They'll have to stop
for fuel, though.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.240
And you won't.

30:37.440 --> 30:41.280
Get ahead.
Get a new Scirocco TDI.

30:44.720 --> 30:50.920
Stunned is the word I'm... The first
thing I'd say is that,
how fast is that Scirocco going?

30:50.920 --> 30:54.880
Do you ever see car adverts with cars
going fast in them?

30:54.880 --> 31:00.080
So, you aren't allowed to show,
in a car advert, a car going fast?

31:00.080 --> 31:02.720
No. No? No.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.000
Also, I suspect, with
some enhanced sound.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
No, we never... No. There's...
No, that was the real sound.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.840
There's screeching tyres in there,
massively accelerating engine...
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.880
It's not just the driving, it's the
sound that you put in.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.000
Happily, we had an idea
which would save the day.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.040
We will go off this afternoon, and
I can mend that advert.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.560
OK...

31:34.200 --> 31:35.960
I believe we have a cure.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.320
You remember the one yesterday...?
Yep.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.520
How could we forget it?

31:40.800 --> 31:43.280
This is the new Scirocco TDI.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.880
It's pretty fast.

31:52.720 --> 31:57.480
Get ahead, get a new Scirocco TDI.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.240
You see, we've
addressed the speed issue.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.120
No, you haven't. It says he's doing
29. The rest of the footage

32:04.120 --> 32:09.720
of the car is exactly
the same, so there's no difference
in the promotion of speed whatsoever.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.800
When we talked to you,
truth and honesty

32:12.800 --> 32:16.280
were two of the things
we talked about,
and that feels dishonest.

32:16.280 --> 32:20.080
Well, it's still going,
it was probably going 59.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.200
And how fast were the other cars
going?

32:22.200 --> 32:25.880
They were going 59
as well. So, twice as fast...

32:25.880 --> 32:28.760
The rest of the ads didn't
go down that well, either.

32:28.760 --> 32:33.240
THEME TUNE FROM MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE

32:33.240 --> 32:38.600
# Common rail injection, you know
that's the new direction... #

32:40.120 --> 32:45.320
The new Scirocco TDI,
for people who value their arms.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.080
Don't you think that is tip-top?

32:47.080 --> 32:48.760
No.

32:48.760 --> 32:55.680
Right...
Desperate, I decided to show them
our remake of one of their classics.

32:55.680 --> 32:59.280
This is the man who
put a million on black -

32:59.280 --> 33:01.840
and it came up red.

33:03.760 --> 33:10.040
This is the man
who married a sex kitten -
just as she turned into a cat.

33:10.040 --> 33:14.240
This is the man
who moved into gold -

33:14.240 --> 33:16.960
just as the clever money moved out.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.680
If only he'd waited for the
new Scirocco TDI to go on sale.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.440
The Scirocco TDI.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.360
Life's not so bad.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.400
Simple, tight...

33:40.400 --> 33:43.360
You are showing in your ad there
a suicide. Yes.

33:43.360 --> 33:49.320
You should be able to imagine that
the regulatory body does not allow
depictions of suicide.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.480
I mean, it's pretty positive.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.560
You either get shot through
the head or you have a VW.

33:54.560 --> 34:00.440
Nick and Margaret invited
us to get out of their office
and go back to the drawing board.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.680
Jesus Christ!

34:12.320 --> 34:15.880
D'you know why an ad man won't look
out of the window in the morning?

34:17.520 --> 34:20.280
No. Cos then he'd have
nothing to do in the afternoon.

34:24.400 --> 34:29.040
But then, while Jeremy was
being ridiculous, I had an idea.

34:29.040 --> 34:35.480
If we couldn't use speed,
why not set the ad in a location
where speed is impossible?

34:35.480 --> 34:41.840
A funeral! Job one,
get ourselves a black Scirocco.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.080
I couldn't help noticing, it's the
petrol one. We'll dub canal boat
noises on.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.000
I'm gonna talk to the mourners.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.679
Yes, just get them in the car.

34:49.679 --> 34:52.520
This is a tragedy, it's a loved one.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.639
It will all be resolved in
the VW Scirocco Diesel.

34:56.639 --> 34:59.360
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SCREECH

35:01.960 --> 35:04.760
Who's driving that...?
Who's driving the Scirocco?

35:04.760 --> 35:07.640
Jeremy. Well,
he's got the wrong idea altogether.

35:07.640 --> 35:11.560
My driving made James quite cross.

35:11.560 --> 35:17.560
Let's do the funeral thing
seriously, then, at the end,
we've got the message about the VW.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.960
It's not complicated.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.840
The funeral can be done seriously,
but there's nothing to stop a war
plane coming in the middle?

35:23.840 --> 35:28.840
There's me. Cos I'm directing.
Soon, he was even more cross.
So, you're driving the hearse...?

35:28.840 --> 35:30.400
I'm driving the limousine...

35:30.400 --> 35:34.000
EXPLOSION

35:34.000 --> 35:35.040
Clarkson!

35:35.040 --> 35:36.880
TYRES SCREECH

35:36.880 --> 35:38.440
None of that is going in.

35:38.440 --> 35:42.760
We're not doing
a comedy Carry On funeral,
we are doing a real funeral.

35:42.760 --> 35:46.800
James and I couldn't even agree
on how to direct the actors.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.160
OK, madam, this is where
we'd like you to cry.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.760
In a dignified,

35:51.760 --> 35:54.520
adult, genuine grief, rather than...

35:54.520 --> 35:57.560
Take a good sniff
of this onion, ready?

35:57.560 --> 36:00.720
There we go. There we go, now cry!

36:00.720 --> 36:03.240
Cry! Cry!

36:03.240 --> 36:07.680
To get James out of my hair,
I sent him to look for a crow.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.480
Crow? A crow.

36:09.480 --> 36:13.200
Have you ever seen a funeral scene
in your life without a crow in it?

36:13.200 --> 36:15.520
There'll be one in a
tree, or in a field.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.480
That left me free to
direct the graveyard scene.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.600
So, if you're mourning, look sad.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.840
You're just professionally sad.

36:24.840 --> 36:30.440
You...should be in a bikini,
I think, to balance it out.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.440
So, good, OK.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.520
No, wait, hang on, it's a funeral.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.840
Yeah, it should be a black bikini.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.320
OK. Roll cameras...

36:39.320 --> 36:44.760
Back! With the graveyard done, all
we had left was the closing shot.

36:44.760 --> 36:49.440
The shot has got be quite long,
because there's quite a bit of
information to get in at the end.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.600
No, the back should... No! No!
Yes! Yes!

36:53.600 --> 36:55.040
Get the wheels straight.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.520
James! Yes?
Do you want mourners in this shot?

36:58.520 --> 37:00.840
No.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.920
It's untidy. Action.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.400
And pull out... James! What?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.960
I've fallen out of the basket thing!

37:13.760 --> 37:15.480
Anyway...

37:15.480 --> 37:19.600
Finally, though,
our masterpiece was ready.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.960
Argh!

37:36.840 --> 37:41.600
With its advanced, two-litre,
common rail diesel engine,

37:41.600 --> 37:44.880
the new Scirocco TDI -

37:44.880 --> 37:48.880
quiet enough for any occasion.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.080
So...

38:04.320 --> 38:05.600
Bang!

38:05.600 --> 38:09.400
Now, that didn't go down very
well, and it was all his fault.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.560
Why did the car blow up at the end?

38:12.560 --> 38:16.560
Because you wouldn't let me cut
one of the mourners' arms off.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.080
Why was that woman in a bikini?

38:19.080 --> 38:23.280
Because I am a genius, and you're
a fool, and that is why, after

38:23.280 --> 38:28.040
that advert was rejected,
as well as all the others,
we decided to split up.

38:28.040 --> 38:34.080
Yeah, we decided we'd make one more
ad each, but this time, instead of
taking them to Nick and Margaret

38:34.080 --> 38:36.800
to judge, because they loathed
everything we did,

38:36.800 --> 38:41.760
we thought we'd bring them here, and
let you decide which one is better.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.120
OK? And the winner,

38:44.120 --> 38:48.520
the winner gets this
pair of exquisitely slim
advertiser's spectacles.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.680
Yeah! Here's mine...

39:15.120 --> 39:18.280
Hear that, James?
The sound of silence. Nobody...

39:18.280 --> 39:23.040
Oh... No! Why are you applauding?!

39:23.040 --> 39:27.360
It's cerebral. That would work on
BBC Four, where there's
no commercials!

39:27.360 --> 39:33.560
And now behold to bask in the
turbulence of my magnificence.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.120
This is my ad.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.920
A state of emergency has been
declared in Poland as
the mass exodus continues...

39:44.920 --> 39:51.520
Sources in Warsaw report mass panic
as those left in the city make
increasingly frantic

39:51.520 --> 39:52.560
efforts to escape.

39:52.560 --> 39:56.680
..thousands of people crammed
into... Military leaders say...

40:01.120 --> 40:02.840
..the country's road network.

40:02.840 --> 40:07.000
The army says it's now powerless
to prevent the ongoing mass exodus.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.840
When in doubt, use the war.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.520
Now, the time has come to vote.

40:27.520 --> 40:32.480
All of those who think that James's
plant advertisement has won,
raise your hands.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.920
Six or seven quite bright
people in the audience.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.960
And all those who think my
Berlin one has won?

40:42.760 --> 40:45.480
YEAH!

40:50.440 --> 40:55.960
Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen, thank you!

40:59.040 --> 41:02.760
Now, a special moment is upon us,
because, you might have thought it

41:02.760 --> 41:06.960
had gone away, but oh, no, because we
are going to do the Cool Wall! Yeah!

41:09.320 --> 41:10.840
It's here!

41:14.080 --> 41:17.200
Take them off!
I can't see a damn thing.

41:17.200 --> 41:21.040
What have we got first?
We'll start off with
this, it is the Ford Focus RS.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.400
Now, this is a
brilliant car, there's no denying it.

41:24.400 --> 41:30.600
What d'you you think of it?
I like it. You like it. It's green.
Is it relevant, is it cool?

41:30.600 --> 41:32.960
Cool. Yeah. Don't like the colour.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.520
At all. Is the car...?

41:36.520 --> 41:42.680
No. No? No, and that's odd, because
he looks like he's got an ASBO.

41:42.680 --> 41:47.240
That is the thing about this car...
It's brilliant. Yeah.

41:47.240 --> 41:52.000
But it's for the bloke
who's always the first to start
the singing on the aeroplane.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.560
You know, the fellow whose
holiday sombrero is too big to get in

41:55.560 --> 41:58.800
the overhead locker, and that's what
he drives. You're wrong.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.200
Nobody who's got one has
been on an aeroplane -

42:01.200 --> 42:04.280
they get stuck in airport security
with their ASBO ankle bracelet.

42:04.280 --> 42:10.200
Yes, that's... It's a great car,
but sadly, it's got to be. It's got
to be uncool.

42:12.680 --> 42:17.040
The Lamborghini Murcielago SV.
What are we thinking?

42:17.040 --> 42:21.440
I'm sorry, there's a man in here...
Coming in!

42:21.440 --> 42:23.760
What was that? Seriously uncool.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.680
Seriously uncool.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.920
Come with me.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.280
I want the ladies and gentlemen
to see this.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.920
The Amish here.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.480
You think this is...?

42:34.480 --> 42:36.440
Seriously uncool.

42:36.440 --> 42:40.200
Would you think it's uncool?
Cos it's a mad sports car.

42:40.200 --> 42:45.960
What's the matter with mad sports
cars? Seriously uncool. How long
before he stabs me?

42:45.960 --> 42:49.200
No, I think this man is
representing... Cos he's...

42:49.200 --> 42:51.720
He's right, ladies and gentlemen!

42:51.720 --> 42:57.000
He's right? Because every time I see
a man, and it is invariably a man...

42:57.000 --> 42:59.400
Go back to the audience, please.

42:59.400 --> 43:03.720
Every time I see a man
getting out of one of these things,

43:03.720 --> 43:08.400
and it is invariably a man, I always
think, that man is wearing a thong.

43:08.400 --> 43:12.240
Is this just something you like
to think about? I'm confused.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.680
Nobody with boxer shorts has
ever bought a Lamborghini.

43:14.680 --> 43:18.800
What? BLEEP I bought a Lamborghini.
Oh, my God! You in a thong!

43:20.600 --> 43:26.160
Ah! Ah! No! It is, I'm afraid, not
seriously uncool, but it is uncool.

43:26.160 --> 43:29.720
Now, this is a BMW Z4.

43:29.720 --> 43:34.040
We like this car. Very much. Not
the old model, not for wife
swappers, nobody's ever

43:34.040 --> 43:38.640
slept with somebody called Muriel
who's married
to Frank, who has one of these.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.760
But we'd like to put it in
the cool section of the board.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.400
Actually, it's resisting. Ready?

43:48.400 --> 43:55.040
It's the weirdest thing. It won't go
in the cool section, and
there's a very good reason for that.

43:55.040 --> 43:59.120
Yeah. The good reason is, James May
has said he's thinking of getting rid

43:59.120 --> 44:06.080
of his Porsche Boxster and getting
one of these. And, well, that means,
that's all that can happen!

44:06.080 --> 44:11.200
That's all it'll do! We can't put it
anywhere else! It won't go!

44:12.760 --> 44:18.960
Now, this is the Nissan 370-Z, OK?
Now, this, as far as I can work out,
is for the sort of chap who likes

44:18.960 --> 44:22.240
a stag night. Me and the lads,
you know the sort of bloke.

44:22.240 --> 44:27.920
He's the sort that sends you those
e-mails that take you ten minutes to
open, and they're not funny.

44:27.920 --> 44:30.520
That's why this is cool -
you're talking about

44:30.520 --> 44:34.680
the bloke who doesn't complain
because you've given him the
wrong olive.

44:34.680 --> 44:42.000
The man who has one of these has
never eaten an olive - he just has
pork itchings. He's a lager lout.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.400
No, he drinks lager, what's wrong
with that? He drinks Stella.
It's just lager.

44:46.400 --> 44:50.680
It's not just lager! You'd be
at the bar, saying,
"Have you got anything Italian?"

44:50.680 --> 44:54.160
This is an old gag but what
are you gonna do about that?

44:54.160 --> 44:56.040
Thank you, that old favourite.

44:58.240 --> 45:02.600
I'm hearing a strange mooing noise.

45:02.600 --> 45:07.240
But you're
mistaking this for a democracy, and
it isn't one, it's a dictatorship.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.360
Oh, dear, Hammond's
gone off in a huff.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.640
Good! Anyway, now, I want to
talk about the Range Rover.

45:13.640 --> 45:17.360
If you asked me, and you're
a small boy, what is the
best car in the world?

45:17.360 --> 45:20.400
I will say, it's a Bugatti
Veyron, but the truth is...

45:20.400 --> 45:22.280
What are you doing?

45:22.280 --> 45:23.800
Oh, yes!

45:27.440 --> 45:28.480
Oh, yeah!

45:31.920 --> 45:36.280
Woah! That'll do. I'll tell you what.
Can you...?

45:36.280 --> 45:38.120
Can you reach it there, shorty?

45:38.120 --> 45:40.240
I can still reach that.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.040
Look, he can't reach it,
poor little fella!

45:43.040 --> 45:46.920
Oh! Tell you what,
from up here, it is going.

45:46.920 --> 45:51.880
I reckon about there, there you go!

46:03.440 --> 46:06.080
What?! No!

46:08.280 --> 46:12.440
What I've just done, ladies and
gentlemen, is hit the kill switch!

46:12.440 --> 46:16.320
Come on, then, come down!
It doesn't work! It's broken!

46:16.320 --> 46:21.840
You see the Zonda,
your favourite car in the world?
Yes... No!

46:21.840 --> 46:24.760
No! That's not right!

46:24.760 --> 46:28.200
See if we put it down here... Yes!

46:35.640 --> 46:43.080
Oh, look. And that. And that.
Look, I can have so much fun!

46:43.680 --> 46:46.760
No, that's just...!

46:48.560 --> 46:51.720
Can I come down now?

46:51.720 --> 46:57.240
Nnnnno. Because it's time to put a
star in our reasonably-priced car.

46:57.240 --> 47:02.920
What can I say about my guest
tonight? As the star of Rain Man,
Top Gun, Days Of Thunder,

47:02.920 --> 47:08.280
Tom Cruise has almost certainly
been interviewed by him.

47:08.280 --> 47:12.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
American chat show legend Jay Leno!

47:18.240 --> 47:22.960
Thank you, thank you very much!
Thank you! I'll have a seat.

47:22.960 --> 47:28.040
Have a seat! This is amazing.

47:30.720 --> 47:36.800
You've been hosting your own show
in America now for what, 17 years,
five nights a week? 17 years, right.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.000
I never thought the day would
come when you'd be here!

47:40.000 --> 47:43.760
This is my favourite show.
We get it on BBC America.
I enjoy watching it.

47:43.760 --> 47:48.760
And as soon as I got some free time,
you were gracious enough to invite
me, and that's why I'm here.

47:48.760 --> 47:54.200
How can we...? The world's biggest
petrol head... Well... Apart from
Geri Halliwell.

47:54.200 --> 48:01.720
..we've ever had here. I'll get on
to your show, if I may. You recently
had Obama Barack on...

48:01.720 --> 48:07.720
Right. Which makes you... No, it's
the other way round, isn't it? Yeah,
but I'm somewhat dyslexic, so that's

48:07.720 --> 48:13.600
all right with me. If people are
gonna choose their names from
Scrabble tiles, I... Anyway, so,

48:13.600 --> 48:18.080
is it easy to get an American
President on the show, or
is it a bit complicated?

48:18.080 --> 48:22.560
It's interesting, the difference.
I had him on as a
candidate twice before.

48:22.560 --> 48:27.040
And each time he would come with his
jacket like on his finger,
with two guys.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.360
As President, oh, my God.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.400
Armies, literally armies come in.

48:33.400 --> 48:39.120
They do a sweep of your staff, and
they go, "Are you Jeremy Clarkson?
Yes. Don't come in tomorrow.

48:39.840 --> 48:44.400
Why? I said don't come in tomorrow!
What, just a background check think?

48:44.400 --> 48:48.880
If you had a joint in your
sock in 1972, you don't...

48:48.880 --> 48:52.960
And that's what they do.
You don't come in, you don't...
We were never told why.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.320
You're just told not
to come in that day.

48:55.320 --> 48:59.720
How weird. And does he phone
work when he's arriving, or is
that all shut down as well?

48:59.720 --> 49:03.200
All cellphones within
60 miles are monitored.

49:03.200 --> 49:07.440
So, be careful. So, everybody
within 60 miles of Barack...?

49:07.440 --> 49:12.440
For key words, if there are certain
key words, they will track you down
and beat you senseless.

49:12.440 --> 49:17.680
We're never more than 60 miles from
the Queen here, are we? We're 60
miles from the Queen.

49:17.680 --> 49:21.840
That's got to be comforting, hasn't
it? I have to say, in terms of
America.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.080
I used to think it was like going to
a prison, just with more food.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.800
When you came home, you felt
like you were coming back to
a free country.

49:28.800 --> 49:33.160
Now, it's the other way
round. You have these speed
cameras here... Just, nothing!

49:33.160 --> 49:38.520
Like, see, in LA, people would say,
why don't you just shoot them out?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.160
Exactly.

49:46.320 --> 49:52.720
In LA, a day doesn't go by, you
don't see a Styrofoam cup stuck
over the lens of a speed camera.

49:52.720 --> 49:56.320
It's not just speed cameras, there's
cameras to monitor everything.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.600
Everything you've done since
you got here.

49:58.600 --> 50:02.360
I'm talking about at the urinals,
I'm talking about in bed, sometimes.

50:02.360 --> 50:05.760
Really? Oh, yeah,
Mr Brown has been recording that.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.720
All right.
I hope he has enough tape!

50:11.080 --> 50:15.240
Now, normally, at this stage,
when we've got people here,

50:15.240 --> 50:18.720
I get to the point of the interview
where I say, talk about your cars.

50:18.720 --> 50:22.760
OK. And they go, I've got
a Honda Accord, and my
wife's got a Toyota Prius, OK?

50:22.760 --> 50:27.000
I just need you to understand how
big a petrol head we have here. OK?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.840
So this is just his cars. Ready?

50:30.840 --> 50:36.200
Dodge Viper, Packard
Caribbean, Chevrolet Corvette,
E-type Jaguar, Bugatti Type-37,

50:36.200 --> 50:39.920
Lamborghini Espada, Chevrolet
Corvette ZR-1, Lamborghini Countach,

50:39.920 --> 50:44.800
Brough Superior, Bentley Turbo-R,
Shelby Mustang 350-GT, Citroen XM,

50:44.800 --> 50:52.560
Fiat Millicento, Corvette Z-06,
Bugatti Type-57, AC Cobra 427,
Lamborghini Miura-S...

50:53.480 --> 50:55.280
Dodge Challenger,

50:55.280 --> 51:01.040
Lagonda V-12, Bentley Speed Six,
Ford Model T,
another Lamborghini Miura,

51:01.040 --> 51:08.120
Dodge Challenger RT, that's page
one. There's page two. D'you wanna
see page three? There's page three.

51:08.120 --> 51:12.200
How the hell do you decide what
to go to work in in the morning?

51:12.200 --> 51:18.160
Who wouldn't do that if they could?
I would, I must confess.
But see, I only have one wife.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.520
I have one woman...

51:23.320 --> 51:26.120
I have one woman and 150 cars.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.680
Thank you!

51:27.680 --> 51:29.240
See? Women know this...

51:31.080 --> 51:37.360
Wouldn't you prefer your man coming
home reeking of transmission
fluid rather than cheap perfume?

51:37.360 --> 51:40.280
Do you spend a lot of time
going to car shows?

51:40.280 --> 51:43.720
That's really all I do, I work
in my garage, I like working on cars.

51:43.720 --> 51:49.360
You'll like this story.
I had my McLaren F1 out,
I took it to a car show.

51:49.360 --> 51:53.600
I see these two
LA gang members, scary guys,

51:53.600 --> 51:57.160
tattoo, the thing on the neck
with the cross, the tear on the...

51:57.160 --> 52:00.920
The whole bit. And they're looking
at my car, and I'm like, "Oh, boy!"

52:00.920 --> 52:04.920
One of them says, "Gordon Murray
designed this, right?"
And I went, "Yeah!"

52:04.920 --> 52:09.520
Then the other guy asked about
David Stephen, and I realised,
I'm prejudging people.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.560
I assumed that because
they look different from me,
that they're criminals.

52:13.560 --> 52:17.120
I felt bad about this.
I said, "You ever
been in one of these?" "No."

52:17.120 --> 52:22.880
I said, "D'you wanna go for a ride?"
They said, "Yeah!" And I realised,
maybe this is a mistake, OK?

52:24.120 --> 52:30.440
As big as they were outside, they
were enormous in the car. The guys'
head, and when that tattoo is here,

52:30.440 --> 52:33.880
you know? With the
misspelled die, and everything.

52:33.880 --> 52:38.600
All right, so, we're driving along.
Guy goes, "Go up here in the
hills, there's no traffic."

52:38.600 --> 52:41.200
Oh, all right, so...

52:41.200 --> 52:45.680
It's not good at this point.
There's a place called Canaan
Road, above Malibu.

52:45.680 --> 52:48.520
There's some tunnels,
which go through the mountain.

52:48.520 --> 52:54.320
I said, "Tell you what, I'll nail
it through the mountains, you guys
have got to hear the F1 McLaren."

52:54.320 --> 52:56.520
I fly through the tunnel, 125.

52:56.520 --> 52:59.800
As I come out of the tunnel,
police car right here.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.920
Pulled over. And now I've got two
gang guys...

53:08.480 --> 53:13.360
They're gonna run a check on these
guys, it'll be drug dealers, my
McLaren will be towed,

53:13.360 --> 53:19.160
they'll drag it to impound,
I'll be arrested for going 100
and... Cop pulls over.

53:19.160 --> 53:25.560
The Highway Patrolman goes, "Know how
fast you're going?" The two guys go,
"We're police officers." No way!

53:27.840 --> 53:32.040
They were undercover,
they were undercover!

53:32.040 --> 53:37.040
Exactly! It was like the
greatest day of my life.

53:37.040 --> 53:40.080
That's just complete win-win.

53:40.080 --> 53:45.040
We don't get that at the
Goodwood Festival Of Speed.
A couple of gang members...

53:45.040 --> 53:46.920
American drivers...

53:46.920 --> 53:50.920
I was talking to Stephen
Fry about this when he came
on a couple of weeks ago.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.720
One of the things we notice,
if you

53:52.720 --> 53:57.120
want to change lanes, you indicate,
nine times out of ten, the guy will
let you pull in.

53:57.120 --> 54:01.320
That never happens in America.
Why can't people see that
you need to pull off...?

54:01.320 --> 54:05.200
Because we're working on the
computer, we are drinking a soda,

54:05.200 --> 54:08.720
we are doing any number of things
way more important than driving.

54:08.720 --> 54:13.920
I do a thing - called Headlines -
we'd show advertisements
for different products.

54:13.920 --> 54:19.920
And one was a laptop that fit on your
steering wheel, it clamped in,
so you could do this...

54:19.920 --> 54:22.360
And this was legal!
They were selling this!

54:22.360 --> 54:27.320
It had a cup holder here,
so you could work the internet
while you were driving your car.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.920
And learning so much!

54:28.920 --> 54:33.720
Now, obviously, you came here
to do a lap, in a car with a
steering wheel on the correct side.

54:33.720 --> 54:39.800
The steering wheel is on
the wrong side. The spring
was broken in the shifter.

54:39.800 --> 54:43.920
Yet, in that British tradition,
I soldiered on. How did it go?

54:43.920 --> 54:47.960
OK, I mean, as long as I don't
get beat by Helen Mirren, I'm OK.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.640
Helen Mirren, where is she?

54:49.640 --> 54:53.680
Where is she? There she is, 1.528. I
think I did better than that.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.880
Shall we find out how Jay got on?
Yes!

54:57.480 --> 54:59.640
Here's your lap, in a Lacetti.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.160
There we go, we're off,
plenty of smoke on the start.

55:04.160 --> 55:07.760
Race car driving's
like sex, all men think
they're good at it.

55:09.560 --> 55:12.920
So, you've got a smooth style there.

55:12.920 --> 55:15.440
We could learn a lot from...
Oh, very smooth.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.160
Much like the sex.

55:17.440 --> 55:22.040
If it doesn't go well, blame it on
the car. Dressed up as Malboro Man.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.880
Oh, I can't say that, can I?

55:23.880 --> 55:26.960
Dressed up as Cowboy Man.
That's smooth again.

55:26.960 --> 55:31.560
That's a little better, at least
I didn't miss a gear that time.

55:31.560 --> 55:35.400
This is the Hammerhead,
this is where you can make
or break your lap.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.880
You must be pleased with that.
Seems all right.

55:39.880 --> 55:44.200
Looking good. Looking very good
coming out, maybe a little bit fast.

55:44.200 --> 55:49.640
The Stig is quite a good instructor,
considering...he doesn't talk.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.840
Let's have a look at this. This
is flat out through there.

55:53.800 --> 55:58.200
Not bad. Yeah. Oh, that's quick!

55:58.200 --> 56:00.600
That was very quick.
Brake, down to third.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.960
Come on, this is the hard...

56:02.960 --> 56:05.120
Yes! That's what I call a corner!

56:05.120 --> 56:06.640
Now, it's Gambon.

56:06.640 --> 56:11.400
That's Michael Gambon, around there,
maybe too much understeer.
But across the line!

56:17.840 --> 56:21.120
Let's find out how you got on.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.480
All right.
You did it...in one minute...

56:24.480 --> 56:26.120
Yes?

56:26.120 --> 56:28.080
..40... Yes?

56:28.080 --> 56:30.000
..8.8.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.160
You're way faster than Helen Mirren!

56:32.160 --> 56:33.680
Oh, all right. You are...

56:38.880 --> 56:44.440
In the middle of the pack.
..between Doctor Who and Will Young.

56:44.440 --> 56:47.160
Actually, I did that once in LA.
Yeah.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.360
This is a good place.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.520
Are you the fastest American?
I'll take fastest American.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.080
I'm just looking.

56:57.080 --> 57:03.120
No, Mark Wahlberg! Mark Wahlberg.
You're the second fastest American!
Second fastest. Wow!

57:03.120 --> 57:05.360
There we go, Jay Leno, everybody!

57:05.360 --> 57:08.480
Jeremy, thank you, thank you,
everybody! Thank you so much!

57:12.200 --> 57:14.280
Still here, obviously.

57:14.280 --> 57:19.160
Now, at this point, I should be
down there, by that car.

57:19.160 --> 57:23.080
But I'm not,
obviously, so please bear with me.

57:23.080 --> 57:27.560
What that car is,
is the Aston Martin Vantage,
that's the smallest car they make.

57:27.560 --> 57:33.400
But they just fitted it with their
510 horsepower, six-litre, V12.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.000
And Jeremy decided to take it out
to see what it's like.

58:21.160 --> 58:27.680
Well, it's an Aston Martin
Vantage, with a V12 engine.

58:27.680 --> 58:32.200
So, what d'you think
it's gonna be like?

58:58.680 --> 59:00.680
It is fantastic.

59:02.520 --> 59:06.440
It's wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful.

59:16.800 --> 59:19.880
What it makes me feel, though,

59:19.880 --> 59:21.400
is sad.

59:23.520 --> 59:28.480
I just can't help thinking that,
thanks to all sorts of things -

59:28.480 --> 59:34.440
the environment, the economy,
problems in the Middle East, the
relentless war on speed,

59:34.440 --> 59:39.360
cars like this will soon be
consigned to the history books.

59:54.360 --> 01:00:00.800
I just have this
horrible, dreadful feeling that what
I'm driving here...is an ending.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.480
Good night.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.840
